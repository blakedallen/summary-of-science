The\nirregularity is expressed as a sum of superabundances of linear systems associated to some\nmultiplier ideals of the branch curve and the proof rests on the theory of standard cyclic\ncoverings. Explicit computations of multiplier ideals are performed and some applications\nare presented.\n\nIntroduction\nLet f (x, y) = 0 be an affine equation of a curve B \u2282 P2 and H\u221e be the line at infinity. The\nprojective surface S0 \u2282 P3 defined by the affine equation z n = f (x, y) is called the n-cyclic\nmultiple plane associated to B and H\u221e . In [20], Zariski obtains his famous result for the\nirregularity of certain n-cyclic multiple planes.\nZariski's Theorem. Let B be an irreducible curve of degree b, transverse to the line\nat infinity H\u221e and with only nodes and cusps as singularities. Let S0 \u2282 P3 be the n-cyclic\nmultiple plane associated to B and H\u221e , and let S be a desingularization of S0 . The surface\nS is irregular if and only if n and b are both divisible by 6 and the linear system of curves of\ndegree 5b/6 \u2212 3 passing through the cusps of B is superabundant. In this case,\nq(S) = h1 (P2 , IZ (\u22123 +\n\n5b\n)),\n6\n\nwhere Z is the support of the set of cusps.\nThe aim of this paper is to present a generalization of Zariski's Theorem to a branch curve\nthat has arbitrary singularities and is transverse to the line at infinity bringing to the fore the\ntheory of cyclic coverings as developed in [18]. The irregularity will be expressed as a sum of\nsuperabundances of linear systems associated to some multiplier ideals of the branch curve\nB. We refer to [4] for the notion of multiplier ideal. To state the main result in Section 2,\nwe recall here that if the rational c varies from a very small positive value to 1, then one can\nattach a collection of multiplier ideals J (cB) that starts at OP2 , diminishes exactly when c\nequals a jumping number-they represent an increasing discrete sequence of rationals-and\nfinally ends at IB .\n\n1\n\n\fTheorem (2.1). Let B be a plane curve of degree b and let H\u221e be a line transverse to\nB. Let S be a desingularization of the n-cyclic multiple plane associated to B and H\u221e . If\n1\nZ, then\nJ(B, n) is the subset of subunitary jumping numbers of B that live in gcd(b,n)\nq(S) =\n\nX\n\nh1 (P2 , IZ(\u03beB) (\u22123 + \u03beb)),\n\n\u03be\u2208J(B,n)\n\nwhere Z(\u03beB) is the subscheme defined by the multiplier ideal J (\u03beB).\nIn case the singularities of B are locally given by xp = y q such as equations, explicit\ncomputations of the jumping numbers and of the multiplier ideals will enable us to apply the\nabove theorem to various examples in Section 4. An example in Remark 4.4 shows that the\nirregularity may jump in case the position of H\u221e with respect to B becomes special.\nGeneralizations of Zariski's Theorem are discussed in several papers and the proofs are\nbased on different points of view. First, Zariski's original argument divides naturally into\nthree parts. He describes the canonical system of S in terms of the conditions imposed by the\nsingularities of S0 that correspond to the cusps. Then he establishes the formula\nq(S) =\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\nk=n\u2212\u230an/6\u230b\n\n\u0018\n\n\u0019\nkb\nh (P , IZ (\u22123 +\n)),\nn\n1\n\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Z denotes the support of the set of cusps. To finish, he invokes the topological result\nproved in [21]: If n is the power of a prime and B is irreducible, then the n-cyclic multiple\nplane is regular. The theorem follows from the examination of the terms that vanish in the\nprevious sum when the degree of the cyclic multiple plane covers an unbounded sequence of\npowers of primes.\nSecond, in [5], Esnault establishes a formula, similar to (1), for the irregularity of the bcyclic multiple plane S0 , where b is the degree of the branch curve B that possesses arbitrary\nisolated singularities. She uses the techniques of logarithmic differential complexes, the existence of a mixed Hodge structure on the complex cohomology of the associated Milnor fibre-\nthe complement of S0 with respect to the plane that contains B-and Kawamata-Viehweg\nVanishing Theorem. In [1], Artal-Bartolo interprets Esnault's formula for irregularity and\napplies it to produce two new Zariski pairs. Two plane curves B1 , B2 \u2282 P2 are called a Zariski\npair if they have the same degree and homeomorphic tubular neighbourhood in P2 , but the\npairs (P2 , B1 ) and (P2 , B2 ) are not homeomorphic. Zariski was the first to discover that there\nare two types of plane sextics with six cuspidal singularities: there are the ones where the\ncusps lie on a conic, and the ones where the cusps don't lie on a plane conic. In [19], Vaqui\u00e9\ngives a formula for the irregularity of a cyclic covering of degree n of a nonsingular algebraic\nsurface Y ramified along a reduced curve B of degree b with respect to some projective embedding and a nonsingular hyperplane section H that intersects B transversally. His formula\nis stated in terms of superabundances of the set of singularities of B and the proof also uses\nthe techniques of logarithmic differential complexes. The superabundances involved are given\nby ideal sheaves that coincide in fact to the multiplier ideals. Vaqui\u00e9's paper is one among\nseveral to introduce the notion of multiplier ideals implicitly and we refer to [4] for this issue.\nThird, in [11], Libgober applies methods from knot theory to study the n-multiple plane\nS0 . His results are expressed in terms of Alexander polynomials and extend Zariski's Theorem\nto irreducible curves B with arbitrary singularities and to lines H\u221e with arbitrary position\n2\n\n\fwith respect to B. Later on, in [12, 13, 14], he deals with the case of reducible curves B having\ntransverse intersection with the line at infinity and the irregularity of the multiple plane is\nexpressed using quasiadjunction ideals. The technique is based on mixed Hodge theory, and\nthe result is a particular case in a vaster study, pursued in the above mentioned papers, where\nthe homotopy groups of the complements of various divisors in smooth projective varieties\nare explored. These groups are related to the Hodge numbers of cyclic or more generally\nabelian coverings ramified along the considered divisors, as well as to the position of their\nsingularities. We refer the reader to [16] for more ample details and references and to [15] for\nthe relation between the quasiadjunction ideals and the multiplier ideals.\nOur argument will follow Zariski's ideas. The multiple plane is transformed into a standard\ncyclic covering of the plane through a sequence of blowing-ups of P3 . Then an analog of the\nformula (1) is obtained thanks to the theory of cyclic coverings:\nq(S) =\n\nn\u22121\nX\nk=1\n\n\u0018\n\n\u0019\nkb\n)).\nh (P , IZ( k B) (\u22123 +\nn\nn\n1\n\n2\n\nFinally Theorem 2.1 is established using Kawamata-Viehweg-Nadel Vanishing Theorem.\nRemark. The above formula coincides with Vaqui\u00e9's in [19] when the latter is interpreted\nfor a plane curve B and a line H transverse to it. At the same time, Vaqui\u00e9's formula in its\ngeneral form might be obtained by the argument we make use of in establishing Theorem 2.1\nif Vaqui\u00e9's general setting were to be considered.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 1 the theory of cyclic coverings and some facts\nabout multiplier ideals are recalled. Next, in Section 2 it is shown how through a sequence of\nblowing-ups a cyclic multiple plane is transformed into a standard cyclic covering of the plane\nand Theorem 2.1 is proved. Explicit computations of the jumping numbers and multiplier\nideals are performed in Section 3, using the theory of clusters. Finally, in Section 4 some\napplications are presented.\nNotation and conventions. All varieties are assumed to be defined over C. Standard\nsymbols and notation in algebraic geometry will be freely used. Moreover, if D is a divisor\non the variety X, we shall often write H i (X, D) and hi (X, D) instead of H i (X, OX (D)) and\nhi (X, OX (D)) respectively. If L is an invertible sheaf on X, then we shall regularly denote\nby L a divisor such that L \u2243 OX (L).\nAcknowledgements.

If G acts faithfully on\nX, then the quotient Y = X/G exists and X is called an abelian covering of Y with group\nG. The map \u03c0 : X \u2192 Y is a finite morphism, \u03c0\u2217 OX is a coherent sheaf of OY -algebras, and\nX \u2243 Spec (\u03c0\u2217 OX ).\nIf X is normal and Y is smooth, then \u03c0 is flat which is equivalent to \u03c0\u2217 OX locally free.\nThe action of G on \u03c0\u2217 OX decomposes it into the direct sum of eigensheaves associated to the\nb\ncharacters \u03c7 \u2208 G,\nM\n\u03c0\u2217 OX =\nL\u22121\n\u03c7 .\nb\n\u03c7\u2208G\n\nThe action of G on L\u03c7 is the multiplication by \u03c7 and L1 = OY .\nTo understand the ring structure of \u03c0\u2217 OX we suppose that every component D of the\nramification locus is 1-codimensional. Such a component is associated to its stabilizer subb that generates H:\nb \u03c8 corresponds to the induced\ngroup H \u2282 G and to a character \u03c8 \u2208 H\nrepresentation of H on the cotangent space to X at D. Dualizing the inclusion H \u2282 G, such\nb \u2192 Z/mf , where mf = |H|; for\na couple (H, \u03c8) is equivalent to a group epimorphism f : G\nb the induced representation \u03c7|H is given by \u03c8 f (\u03c7)\u2022 .\nany \u03c7 \u2208 G,\nHere and later on, a\u2022 denotes the smallest non-negative integer in the equivalence class of\nb to different Z/mZ.\na \u2208 Z/m, and F the set of all group epimorphisms from G\nLet Bf be the divisor whose components belong to the branch locus and are exactly those\ncovered by components of the ramification locus associated to the group epimorphism f .

We refer again to [18] for the case of abelian groups.\nProposition 1.1. Let \u03c0 : X \u2192 Y be a cyclic covering with X normal, Y smooth and\nb then for every\nevery component of the ramification locus 1-codimensional.

For the proof we need to define the sequence (\u03b6km,r )k\u22650 : for m and r fixed positive\nintegers with r \u2264 m, and for k \u2265 0, put \u03b6km,r = 1 if \u230akr\u230b\u2022m < r, and \u03b6km,r = 0 otherwise.\nm,r\nObviously this sequence is m-periodic, \u03b6m\n= \u03b60m,r = 1 and in case m > r, \u03b61m,r = 0.\nNow, from the hypotheses, \u03c7 spans the group of characters.

On P2 let L\u03c7 = O(1) and nL\u03c7 \u2261 H0 + (n \u2212 1)H\u221e , where H0 and H\u221e are\nb \u2192 Z/n involved in (2) are given by\ntwo fixed different lines. Here the only functions f : G\n\u03c7 7\u2192 1 and by \u03c7 7\u2192 n \u2212 1. In this way, the standard n-cyclic covering S0 \u2192 P2 is normal\nand has a singular point above P , the intersection of H0 and H\u221e . To desingularize it, we\nconsider the blow-up surface BlP P2 , with E the exceptional divisor and the induced cyclic\ncovering S \u2192 BlP P2 . We have nL\u03c7 \u2261 H0 + (n \u2212 1)H\u221e + nE and the induced covering\nS is not normal above E.

Assume that the support of the Q-divisor KY |X \u2212\u03bc\u2217 D is a union of irreducible\nsmooth divisors with normal crossing intersections. Then \u03bc\u2217 OY (KY |X \u2212 \u230a\u03bc\u2217 D\u230b) is an ideal\nsheaf J (D) on X. We will denote by Z(D) the subscheme defined by this ideal. Hence\nIZ(D) = J (D). Showing that J (D) is independent of the choice of the resolution, see [10],\nwe have:\nDefinition. The ideal J (D) = \u03bc\u2217 OY (KY |X \u2212 \u230a\u03bc\u2217 D\u230b) is called the multiplier ideal of D.\nThe sheaf computing the multiplier ideal verifies the following vanishing result: for every\ni > 0, Ri \u03bc\u2217 OY (KY |X \u2212 \u230a\u03bc\u2217 D\u230b) = 0.

The rational numbers \u03bei 's are called the jumping numbers of B\nat P .\n\n2\n\nThe irregularity of cyclic multiple planes\n\nTheorem 2.1. Let B be a plane curve of degree b and let H\u221e be a line transverse to B.\nLet S be a desingularization of the projective n-cyclic multiple plane associated to B and H\u221e .\n1\nIf J(B, n) is the subset of subunitary jumping numbers of B that live in gcd(b,n)\nZ, then\nX\nq(S) =\nh1 (P2 , IZ(\u03beB) (\u22123 + \u03beb)),\n\u03be\u2208J(B,n)\n\nwith Z(\u03beB) the subscheme defined by the multiplier ideal of \u03beB.\nThe proof splits naturally into four parts. First, we show that there is a sequence of\nblowing-ups of P3 such that S1 , the strict transform of the multiple plane S0 \u2282 P3 , becomes\na standard cyclic covering of the plane defined by nL\u2032\u03c7 \u2261 B + (\u03b2n \u2212 b)H\u221e , with \u03b2 = \u2308b/n\u2309\nand L\u2032\u03c7 = OP2 (\u03b2). Second we choose a desingularization of B such that its total transform\non \u03bc : Y \u2192 P2 is a divisor with normal crossing intersections, a log resolution. It induces\na standard cyclic covering S2 . We apply the normalization procedure to it and obtain a\nnormalization S of S0 , defined by the line bundle L\u03c7 and that has only Hirzebruch-Jung\nsingularities.\nS/@\n//@@\n// @@@\n// @\u001f\u001f\n/\n\u03c0 // S2\n//\n//\n/\n\n\u0017\u0017 \u000f\u000f\nY\n\n// S1\n\u03bc\n\n// S0\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// P2\n\nThird, we compute the line bundles L\u03c7k 's in terms of the pull-back \u03bc\u2217 OP2 (1) and the exceptional configuration on Y and get the irregularity of S as a sum of some h1 's. Finally, the\nresult is obtained by applying the Kawamata-Viehweg-Nadel Vanishing Theorem.\nThe first step is given by:\nProposition 2.2. Let S0 be the n-multiple plane associated to the curve B of degree b\nand the line H\u221e . There exists a sequence of blowing-ups S1 \u2192 S0 such that S1 is the standard\ncyclic covering of the plane determined by\nnL\u2032\u03c7 \u2261 B + (\u03b2n \u2212 b)H\u221e ,\nwith \u03b2 = \u2308b/n\u2309 and L\u2032\u03c7 \u2261 \u03b2H.\n7\n\n\fProof. Let [x0 , . . . , x3 ] be a homogeneous system of coordinates in P3 . Let \u039b be the plane\ndefined by x3 = 0, and let B, H\u221e \u2282 \u039b be defined by F (x0 , x1 , x2 ) = 0 and x0 = 0, respectively.\nH\u221e will be called the line at infinity. The projective n-cyclic multiple plane S0 \u2282 P3 is defined\nby xn3 = x0n\u2212b F (x0 , x1 , x2 ).\nIf deg B = b \u2264 n, then things are easy. The point N of homogeneous coordinates [0, 0, 0, 1]\nis not on S0 . The complement of the exceptional divisor E in the blow-up of P3 at N coincides\nwith the total space of the line bundle OP2 (1). Over any open subset xi 6= 0 of the projective\nplane \u039b, i = 0, 1, 2, if z = x3 /xi , then z coincides with the tautological section of p\u2217 O\u039b (1)\nwith p : BlN P3 \u2212 E \u2192 \u039b. The zero divisor of p\u2217 F \u2212 z defines S0 . Hence S0 is the standard\ncyclic covering determined by\nnL\u2032\u03c7 \u2261 B + (n \u2212 b)H\u221e ,\nwith L\u2032\u03c7 \u2261 H.\nIf deg B = b > n, then the situation is slightly more complicated since now N lies on S0 .\nLet \u039e be the plane spanned by H\u221e and N . In the open set x3 6= 0, S0 is defined by\nub\u2212n\n= F (u0 , u1 , u2 ),\n0\nwith ui = xi /x3 , 0 \u2264 i \u2264 2. First, we blow up the projective space at N , X1 = BlN P3 \u2192 P3 .\nE \u2282 BlN P3 denotes again the exceptional divisor and L\u221e \u2282 E the line that correspond to \u039e,\ni.e. L\u221e = \u039e \u2229 E. The strict transform S0 is defined by\n(1) b\u2212n\n\nu0\n(1) (1)\n\n(1) n\n\n= u1\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\nF (u0 , 1, u2 )\n\n(1) (1)\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\non the subset u0 = u0 u1 , u1 = u1 , u2 = u1 u2 . Notice that the line L\u221e : u0 = u1 = 0\nis contained in S0 . What we have to understand is the geometry of S0 along L\u221e .\nSecond, we see X1 as P(O\u039b \u2297 O\u039b (1)) \u2192 \u039b and make an elementary transform of X1 along\nL\u221e . We blow up X1 along L\u221e (the trace of the new exceptional divisor on E is denoted by\nL\u221e ). Then, we contract the strict transform of \u039e to L\u221e . We obtain X2 = P(O\u039b \u2297O\u039b (2)) \u2192 \u039b.\nThe new exceptional divisor becomes an F 1 through H\u221e and L\u221e , and will be denoted by \u039e.\n(1)\n(2)\n(1)\n(2) (2)\n(1)\n(2)\nOn u0 = u0 , u1 = u0 u1 , u2 = u2 , an equation for S0 is\n(2) b\u22122n\n\nu0\n(2)\n\n(2) n\n\n= u1\n\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\nF (u0 , 1, u2 ),\n\n(2)\n\nwith L\u221e : u0 = u1 = 0.\nAfter \u03b2 \u2212 1 elementary transforms along L\u221e , we get S0 \u2282 P(O\u039b \u2297 O\u039b (\u03b2)) \u2192 \u039b with S0\nlocally characterized by\n(\u03b2) b\u2212\u03b2n\n(\u03b2) n\n(\u03b2)\n(\u03b2)\nu0\n= u1 F (u0 , 1, u2 ).\n(\u03b2)\n\n(\u03b2)\n\n(\u03b2)\n\nE is defined by u0 = 0 and L\u221e by u0 = u1 = 0. The new \u039e is the Hirzebruch surface\n(\u03b2)\n(\u03b2)\n(\u03b2)\nF \u03b2 . To finish, we put z = 1/u1 and look at x = u0 and y = u2 as to local coordinates\non \u039b. Then\nS0 : z n = x\u03b2n\u2212b F (x, 1, y).\nThe complement of E in X\u03b2 seen through p : X\u03b2 \u2212 E \u2192 \u039b, coincides with the total space\nof O\u039b (\u03b2). The coordinate z coincides with the tautological section of p\u2217 O\u039b (\u03b2). We conclude\nthat S0 is the standard cyclic covering determined by\nnL\u2032\u03c7 \u2261 B + (\u03b2n \u2212 b)H\u221e ,\nwith L\u2032\u03c7 \u2261 \u03b2H.\n\n\u0003\n8\n\n\fFor the next step in the proof of Theorem 2.1 we need several preliminary results.\nProposition 2.3.

In [21] the following topological result is established: If q is the power of a prime\nand B is irreducible and transverse to H\u221e , then the q-cyclic multiple plane is regular. By inspecting the formula for the irregularity given in Theorem 2.1 for q-multiple planes associated\nto B and H\u221e , q a power of a prime such that there exists a jumping number l/q \u2208 J(B, n),\nwe obtain the corollary.\n\u0003\n\n3\n\nThe case of specified singularities\n\nExplicit versions of Theorem 2.1 may be formulated as soon as the multiplier ideals and\nthe jumping numbers can be evaluated.

Let B be a plane curve of degree b with each of its singular points of\ntype, either A1 , or given locally by the equation xdp \u2212 y dq = 0.

We need to control the jumping\nnumbers and the multiplier ideals associated to a curve with this type of singularities. The\nmultiplier ideals and their jumping numbers are known in this case; see for example [3] and\n[4], or [9] for the case of monomial ideals in general. We like to present a different argument\nbased on Enriques diagrams for the particular case of two unknowns, since it will provide a\nsimple interpretation of the multiplier ideals involved, and also, could provide an algorithm\nfor the generalization to an arbitrary singular point of a curve on a surface.\n\n3.1\n\nClusters and Enriques diagrams\n\nLet X be a surface and P \u2208 X a smooth point. A point Q is called infinitely near to P\nif Q \u2208 X \u2032 , \u03bc : X \u2032 \u2192 X is a composition of blowing-ups and Q lies on the exceptional\nconfiguration that maps to P .\nDefinition. A cluster in X, centered at a smooth point P is a finite set of weighted infinitely\nnear points to P , K = {P1w1 , . . . , Prwr }, with P1 = P .\nLet \u03bc : Y \u2192 X be the composition of blowing-ups Y = Yr+1 \u2192 Yr \u2192 * * * \u2192 Y1 = X,\nwith Y\u03b1+1 = BlP\u03b1 Y\u03b1 . Since the points infinitely near P are partially ordered-the point Q\nprecedes the point R if and only if R is infinitely near Q-the points of a cluster are partially\nordered. In the sequel, if K is a cluster, then all points preceding a point that belongs to K\nare in K, possibly with weight 0.\nLet K be a cluster centered at P . Each point P\u03b1 corresponds to an exceptional divisor\nE\u03b1 \u2282 Y\u03b1+1 . All its strict transforms will also be denoted by E\u03b1 and the total transform\nof each E\u03b1 will be denoted by F\u03b1 . When needed, the strict transform of E\u03b1 on Y\u03b2 will be\n(\u03b2)\n(\u03b1+1)\n(\u03b1+1)\ndenoted by E\u03b1 , and similarly for the totalP\ntransform. For example F\u03b1\n= E\u03b1\n.\nEvery cluster K defines a divisor DK = w\u03b1 F\u03b1 on Y and an ideal sheaf \u03bc\u2217 OY (\u2212DK ) on\nX, hence a subscheme ZK of X. The lemma below clarifies the comparison between the ideal\nsheaf OY (\u2212DK ) and the pull-back \u03bc\u2217 \u03bc\u2217 OY (\u2212DK ).\n13\n\n\fDefinitions. Let K be a cluster. A point P\u03b2 is said to be proximate to P\u03b1 if P\u03b2 lies on\nE\u03b1 , the exceptional divisor corresponding to the blowing-up at P\u03b1 , or on one of its strict\ntransforms.\nA cluster K is said to satisfy the proximity relations if for every P\u03b1 in K,\nX\nw\u03b2 \u2264 w\u03b1 .\nw\u03b1 =\nP\u03b2 proximate to P\u03b1\n\nLemma 3.2 (see also [2], Theorem 4.2). Let K = {P1w1 , . . . , Prwr } be a cluster that contains\nw\u2032\n\nw\u2032\n\na point P\u03b1 for which the proximity relation is not satisfied. If K \u2032 = {P1 1 , . . . , Pr r } is the\ncluster defined by w\u03b1\u2032 = w\u03b1 +1, w\u03b2\u2032 = w\u03b2 \u22121 for every \u03b2 with P\u03b2 proximate to P\u03b1 , and w\u03b3\u2032 = w\u03b3\notherwise, then K and K \u2032 define the same subscheme in X, i.e. \u03bc\u2217 OY (\u2212DK ) = \u03bc\u2217 OY (\u2212DK \u2032 ).\nK \u2032 is said to be obtained from K by the unloading procedure. Starting from K, iterated\ne that satisfies the proximity relations and\napplications of this procedure lead to a cluster K\ne is called the unloaded cluster. Notice that\ndefines the same subscheme in X. K\n\u03bc\u2217 \u03bc\u2217 OY (\u2212DK ) \u2243 \u03bc\u2217 \u03bc\u2217 OY (\u2212DKe ) \u2243 OY (\u2212DKe ).\n\nRemark. If wr < 0, then the proximity relation is not satisfied at Pr since w r = 0. When\nthe unloading procedure of Lemma 3.2 is applied to a cluster with non-negative weights,\nit may happen that a weight becomes negative, or more precisely, becomes \u22121. But it is\nto be noticed that the negative weight is eventually rubbed out by the next applications of\nthe procedure, and that the unloaded cluster has only non-negative weights. Moreover, the\nunloaded cluster associated to a cluster with non-positive weights is the empty cluster, the\none with all its weights equal to 0.\nDefinition. A gridded tree is a couple (T, g), where T = T (V, A) is an oriented tree with\nV the set of vertices and A the set of arcs, and g is a map\ng : A \u2192 {slant, horizontal, vertical}.\nDefinition. Let T be a gridded tree. A horizontally (vertically) L-shape branch of T is an\nordered chain of arcs, such that each begins where the previous ends, and such that all are\nhorizontal (vertical), but the first.\nNotice that an L-shape branch is completely determined by the subset of incident vertices\nof it. Moreover, an arc is an L-shape branch, regardless its value through g.\nDefinition. Let T be a gridded tree. A segment is a maximal chain of arcs of the same\ntype through g, arcs that are also maximal L-shape branches.\nExample 3.3. Let p < q be relatively prime positive integers. Tp,q will denote the gridded\ntree associated to the Euclidean algorithm. If r0 = a1 r1 + r2 , . . . , rm\u22122 = am\u22121 rm\u22121 + rm and\nrm\u22121 = am rm , with r0 = q and r1 = p, then Tp,q has d segments containing a1 , . . . , am\u22121 and\nrespectively am vertices each. The first segment is slanted and the others are alternatively,\neither horizontal or vertical, starting with a horizontal one.\n\n14\n\n\fDefinition. An Enriques diagram is an weighted gridded tree.\nClusters and Enriques diagrams carry the same information as the lemma below asserts,\nand it will often be convenient to argue using diagrams.\nDefinition. A point of a cluster is said to be free if it is proximate to exactly one point\nof the cluster. A point is said to be a satellite if it is proximate to exactly two points of the\ncluster.\nLemma 3.4 (see [6]). There exists an unique map from the set of clusters in X centered\nat a smooth point P to the set of Enriques diagrams such that:\n1. for every cluster K = {P1w1 , . . . , Prwr } the set of vertices of the image tree is V =\n{P1 , . . . , Pr } with the weights given by the integers w1 , w2 , . . . , wr ;\n2. at every point ends at most one arc;\n3. a point P\u03b1 is satellite if and only if there is either a horizontal or a vertical arc that\nends at the vertex P\u03b1 ;\n(\u03b2)\n4. if there is an arc that begins at the vertex P\u03b1 and ends at the vertex P\u03b2 then P\u03b2 \u2208 E\u03b1 ,\nand the converse is true if P\u03b2 is free;\n5. P\u03b2 is proximate to P\u03b1 if and only if there is an L-shape branch that starts at P\u03b1 and\nends at P\u03b2 ;\n6. the strict transforms E\u03b1 and E\u03b2 intersect on Y if and only if the Enriques diagram\ncontains a maximal L-shape branch that has P\u03b1 and P\u03b2 as its extremities;\n7. an arc that begins at a vertex of a free point and ends at a vertex of a satellite point is\nhorizontal.\n\n3.2\n\nThe minimal unloaded clusters associated to a Tp,q tree\n\nLet p < q be relatively prime positive integers. All clusters treated in this subsection will\nbe associated to the gridded tree Tp,q introduced in Example 3.3. The intent is to look for a\ncharacterization of the minimal unloaded clusters modeled on Tp,q . We refer to Lemma 3.7\nfor the result.\nDepending on the context its vertices will be denoted either by P\u03b1 i.e. using one subscript\n1 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 r = a1 + * * * + am , or by Pk,i , i.e. using two subscripts 1 \u2264 k \u2264 d, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 ak . T3,5 is\nrepresented below in the latter notation.\nP3,2\nP2,1\n\nP3,1\n\nP1,1\nLet K be a cluster. We define the proximity matrix of K by \u03a0 = ||p\u03b1\u03b2 ||, where the\nelements of the diagonal equal 1 and, for every \u03b1 6= \u03b2, the element p\u03b1\u03b2 equals \u22121 if P\u03b2 is\nproximate to P\u03b1 and 0 if not. Notice that along the \u03b1 column of \u03a0, the non-zero elements\nnot on the diagonal correspond to the points to which P\u03b1 is a satellite.\n\n15\n\n\fThe proximity matrix is the decomposition matrix of the strict transforms E\u03b1 's in terms\nof the total transforms F\u03b1 's. Hence if K = {P1w1 , . . . , Prwr }, then on Y ,\nX\nX\nDK =\nw\u03b1 F\u03b1 =\nc\u03b1 E\u03b1 ,\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\nand c = w \u03a0\u22121 , where w = (w1 , . . . , wr ) and similarly c = (c1 , . . . , cr ). The formula\nX\nF\u03b2\nE\u03b1 = F\u03b1 \u2212\nP\u03b2 proximate to P\u03b1\n\nand induction on \u03b1 tell us that the coefficient of Er in the decomposition of a total transform\ncorresponding to a point lying on the kth segment in terms of strict transforms equals the\nremainder rk introduced in Example 3.3.\nLemma 3.5. If K = {P1w1 , . . . , Prwr } is an unloaded cluster centered at P , then the coefficient of Er is of the form ap + bq, with a, b non-negative integers.\nProof. We shall denote the weights on the kth segment of the Enriques diagram for the\ncluster K by wk,1 , wk,2 , . . . , wk,ak and the coefficient of Er by cr . We shall successively transform the cluster, each time considering the last segment that contains non-zero weights, unless\nthis segment is the first or the second one. The transformation is P\nthe following: if the last\nsegment with non-zero weights is the segment k + 1, and if wk,ak = i wk+1,i , then put\n\u2032\n= 0 for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 ak+1 ,\n1. wk+1,i\n\n\u2032 =w\n2. wk,i\nk,i \u2212 w k,ak for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 ak ,\n\u2032\n3. wk\u22121,1\n= wk\u22121,1 + wk,ak ,\n\nand leave the other weights unchanged. It is easy to see that the cluster K \u2032 defined by the\n\u2032 is again unloaded and that the coefficient of E remains unchanged. Hence the\nweights wk,i\nr\nsame process can be applied till eventually K is transformed into the cluster K \u2032 with non-zero\nweights only on the first and, at the most, the second segments of the Enriques diagram. K \u2032\nis unloaded and\ncr = c\u2032r = p\n\na1\nX\ni=1\n\n\u2032\nw1,i\n+ r2\n\na2\nX\n\n\u2032\nw2,j\n=p\n\na1\nX\n\u2032\n(w1,i\n\u2212 w\u2032 1,a1 ) + qw\u2032 1,a1 ,\ni=1\n\nj=1\n\nwhere q = a1 p + r2 .\n\n\u0003\n\nBesides, since for each couple of non-negative integers a, b there exists an unloaded cluster\nwith ap + bq the coefficient of Er -for example the cluster with w1,1 = a + b, w1,i = b for\ni 6= 1, w2,1 = b and wk,i = 0 otherwise-, the ideal sheaf \u03bc\u2217 OY (\u2212(ap + bq)Er ) defines the\nminimal unloaded cluster having ap + bq the coefficient of Er . It is natural to ask the question\nwhether we can decide if an unloaded cluster is minimal only by inspection of its weights, or\nequivalently its associated divisor. The answer is yes and is given by the lemma hereafter. It\nwill deal with clusters satisfying the following condition:\n\n16\n\n\f(\u2217) for every ordered chain of maximal L-shape branches determined by the points\nP\u03b11 , . . . , P\u03b1l , i.e. each P\u03b1j precedes P\u03b1j+1 and the jth maximal L-shape branch\nstarts at P\u03b1j and ends at P\u03b1j+1 , then\nl\nl\nX\nX\np\u03b1j + 2 \u2212 l.\n(w\u03b1j \u2212 w\u03b1j ) <\nj=1\n\nj=1\n\nDefinition 3.6. If a and b are non negative integers, Kp,q (a, b) denotes the minimal unloaded\ncluster associated to the Tp,q tree and whose coefficient of the last strict transform equals\nap + bq.\nLemma 3.7. Let K be an unloaded cluster with ap + bq the coefficient of its last strict\ntransform. K satisfies (\u2217) if and only if K = Kp,q (a, b).\nProof. We start by showing that a minimal unloaded cluster K min always satisfies (\u2217).\nIndeed, if not, there would exist a chain of maximal L-shape branches such that p\u03b1j \u2265\nP\nP\nw\u03b1j \u2212 w \u03b1j for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 l, and that l1 w\u03b1j \u2212 w \u03b1j \u2265 l1 (p\u03b1j \u2212 1) + 2. Furthermore, since there\nwould be at least two points such that p\u03b1 = w\u03b1 \u2212 w \u03b1 , we may always assume w\u03b11 \u2212 w\u03b11 = p\u03b11 ,\nw\u03b1j \u2212 w \u03b1j = p\u03b1j \u2212 1 for 2 \u2264 j \u2264 l \u2212 1, and w\u03b1l \u2212 w \u03b1l = p\u03b1l . Now for this chain, we could\napply the inverse of the unloading procedure successively at P\u03b11 , P\u03b12 , . . . , P\u03b1l to end up with\nan unloaded cluster with the same coefficient for Er as K min , hence a contradiction.\nTo end the proof, we assume that K 6= K min , K and K min having the same coefficient for\nEr , and show that K does not satisfy (\u2217). Since it is satisfied by K min , we notice that along\neach segment of K min , there is at most one jump of height 1. We may further assume that\nmin + 1. To make up for the apparent increase of c\nw1,1 \u2265 w1,1\nm,am (= cr ) by at least r1 = p\nmin\ndue to the difference between w1,1 and w1,1 , some of the weights along the next segments of\nK must be smaller than the corresponding weights of K min , but not along the first segment.\nLooking at the points on the second segment and at the first point of the third segment for\nthis counterbalance problem, we notice that at most one of their weights may not diminish,\notherwise (\u2217) will not be satisfied somewhere along the following segments. Two possibilities\nmin \u2212 1 and, either\ncan appear. First, all a2 weights of the second segment satisfy w2,i \u2264 w2,i\nmin \u2212 1, or w\nmin\nthere exists an i such that w3,i \u2264 w3,i\n3,i = w3,i for all i's. In the former case (\u2217)\nis not verified at P1,a1 , P3,1 , P3,2 , . . . , P3,i , and in the latter the same counterbalance problem\nmust be solved for a difference of r3 units, starting with the fourth segment. Second, the\nmin \u2212 1 are verified for all but one point of the second segment, and\ninequalities w2,i \u2264 w2,i\nmin \u2212 1. There is a counterbalance problem left for r units, starting with the third\nw3,1 \u2264 w3,1\n2\nsegment. Eventually, the counterbalance problem is pushed on to the last segment and hence\n(\u2217) will not be satisfied there for K.\n\u0003\n\n3.3\n\nThe multiplier ideals and the jumping numbers for (xdp , y dq )\n\nLet P be a singular point of B \u2282 X given locally by xdp + y dq = 0, with p, q and d positive\nintegers and p \u2264 q relatively prime, and let \u03bc : Y \u2192 X be the minimal log resolution of B at\nP . The exceptional configuration of \u03bc is given by the gridded tree Tp,q . As before, we shall\ndenote by Er the last strict transform.\n\n17\n\n\fLemma 3.8. The coefficient of Er in \u2212KY |X + \u230a\u03bc\u2217 \u03beB\u230b equals \u230adpq\u03be\u230b \u2212 (p + q \u2212 1).\nProof. It is sufficient to determine the coefficient of Er in \u03bc\u2217 B. By Example 3.3 and the\ndecomposition of the F\u03b1 's in terms of the strict transforms, we have that the coefficient of Er\n2 = dpq.\n\u0003\nis a1 r12 + * * * + am rm\nProposition 3.9. If cr is the coefficient of Er in \u2212KY |X + \u230a\u03bc\u2217 \u03beB\u230b, then the multiplier\nideal J (\u03beB) is given by\nJ (\u03beB) = \u03bc\u2217 OY (\u2212cr Er ),\ni.e. is the ideal sheaf associated to the minimal cluster that contains cr Er .\nProof. We shall argue on the cluster associated to the divisor \u2212KY |X + \u230a\u03bc\u2217 \u03beB\u230b. To find\nthe multiplier idealPis equivalent to determine the unloaded corresponding\nP cluster. Let the\npull-back of B be r1 c\u03b1 E\u03b1 + B = c * E + B. Then \u2212KY |X + \u230a\u03bc\u2217 \u03beB\u230b = r1 w\u03b1 F\u03b1 = w * F ,\nwith w = \u2212\u03c9 + \u230a\u03bec\u230b * \u03a0 and \u03c9 = (1, . . . , 1).\nLet P\u03b11 , . . . , P\u03b1l be ordered points that determine a chain of maximal L-shape branches.\nSince\n(14)\nw \u2212 w = w t \u03a0 = \u230a\u03bec\u230b \u03a0 t \u03a0 \u2212 \u03c9 t \u03a0,\nwhere the matrix \u2212\u03a0 \u03a0t is the intersection matrix of the strict transforms E\u03b1 's on the surface\nY , for every 1 \u2264 j \u2264 l,\n\u0005\n\u0005 \u0004\n\u0005\n\u0004\n\u0004\nw\u03b1j \u2212 w\u03b1j = \u2212 \u03bec\u03b1j\u22121 + (p\u03b1j + 1) \u03bec\u03b1j \u2212 \u03bec\u03b1j+1 + (p\u03b1j \u2212 1).\nP\nSo lj=1 (w\u03b1j \u2212 w \u03b1j ) equals\n\u2212 \u230a\u03bec\u03b10 \u230b + p\u03b11 \u230a\u03bec\u03b11 \u230b +\n\nl\nl\u22121\nX\n\u0005\n\u0004\n\u0005 X\n\u0004\n(p\u03b1j \u2212 1),\n(p\u03b1i \u2212 1) \u03bec\u03b1j + p\u03b1l \u230a\u03bec\u03b1l \u230b \u2212 \u03bec\u03b1l+1 +\nj=1\n\nj=2\n\nand since c \u03a0 t \u03a0 = (0, . . . , 0, d), we have\n\u22122 <\n\nl\nX\n\n(w\u03b1j \u2212 w \u03b1j ) <\n\nj=1\n\nl\nX\n\np\u03b1j + 2 \u2212 l.\n\n(15)\n\nj=1\n\nPutting l = 1 we observe that if the proximity relation is not satisfied at P\u03b1 , then w\u03b1 \u2212 w\u03b1 =\n\u22121. But the unloading procedure of Lemma 3.2 at P\u03b1 changes the vector w\u2212w into the vector\nw \u2212 w + (\u03a0 t \u03a0)\u03b1 . It follows that the unloading procedure does not change the inequalities\nin (15) for the new cluster. We conclude that the unloaded cluster satisfies (\u2217), hence, by\nLemma 3.7, the result.\n\u0003\nProposition 3.10. The jumping numbers of B at P are (ap + bq)/(dpq) with a, b positive\nintegers.\nProof. Let \u03be be a jumping number and K \u2032 the corresponding unloaded cluster and let,\nby Lemma 3.5, c\u2032r = a\u2032 p + b\u2032 q be its coefficient for Er with a\u2032 , b\u2032 non-negative integers. By\nLemma 3.8 and Proposition 3.9, we have\n\u230adpq\u03be\u230b \u2212 (p + q \u2212 1) = ap + bq + 1 \u2264 a\u2032 p + b\u2032 q\nwhere a and b are non-negative integers, and a\u2032 p+b\u2032 q is the first integer combination of p and q\nwith this property. So, by the definition of the jumping numbers, \u03be = ((a+1)p+(b+1)q)/(dpq).\n\u0003\n18\n\n\fProof of Corollary 3.1. We know that the irregularity is given by\nX\nh1 (P2 , IZ(\u03beB) (\u22123 + \u03beb))\n\u03be\u2208J(B,n)\n\nwith J(B, n) the subset of jumping numbers \u03be of B of the form k/n, 0 < k < n, and such\nthat \u03beb is an integer. By Proposition 3.10, it is sufficient to describe the subscheme associated\nto the multiplier ideal J (\u03beB) for every \u03be = (\u03b1p + \u03b2q)/(dpq) \u2208 J(B, n). By Proposition 3.9,\nLemma 3.8 and Lemma 3.7, the subscheme is given by the minimal unloaded cluster whose\ncoefficient for the last strict transform is the first integer combination of p and q not smaller\nthan (\u03b1 \u2212 1)p + (\u03b2 \u2212 1)q + 1.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.11. Since many of the applications in the next section will be for a curve B with\nsingularities of a given type A\u2022 , we interpret Corollary 3.1 for this situation. If P1 , . . . , Pr\nare the infinitely near points to P = P1 involved in the minimal log resolution of an A\u2022 type\n[\u03b1]\nsingularity at P , we shall denote by ZP the curvilinear subscheme associated to the unloaded\n[\u03b1]\ncluster {P1 , . . . , P\u03b1 }, and by Z [\u03b1] = \u222aZP .\ni) If the singularities of B are of type A1 or A2r\u22121 , i.e. p = 1, q = r and d = 2, then\nq(S) =\n\nX\n\nh1 (P2 , IZ [\u03b1] (\u22123 +\n\n\u03b1\n\n(\u03b1 + r)b\n)),\n2r\n\n1\n\u03b1 ranging from 1 to r \u2212 1 such that \u03b1+r\n2r \u2208 gcd(b,n) Z.\nii) If the singularities of B are of type A1 or A2m , i.e. p = 2, q = 2m + 1 and d = 1, then\n\nq(S) =\n\nX\n\nh1 (P2 , IZ [\u03b1] (\u22123 +\n\n\u03b1\n\nb\n\u03b1b\n+ )),\n2m + 1 2\n\nn and b are even, and \u03b1 ranges from 1 to m such that\n\n4\n\n\u03b1\n2m+1\n\n\u2208\n\n1\ngcd(b,n)\n\nZ.\n\nApplications\n\nWe shall now apply the results in the previous sections to illustrate how to compute in an\nuniform way, the irregularity for some examples of cyclic multiple planes.\n\nZariski's example\nThe curve B is irreducible, of degree 6 and has six cusps as singularities. In the formula for\nthe irregularity of the 6-cyclic multiple plane in Remark 3.11 ii), since m = 1, \u03b1 may only be\n1. Hence q(S) = h1 (P2 , IZ (2)), where Z is the support of the cusps. So either the cusps lie\non a conic and the irregularity is 1, or they do not, and the irregularity is 0. Notice that the\nresult is the same for every n-cyclic multiple plane, provided that 6 divides n.\n\n19\n\n\fArtal-Bartolo's first example in [1]\nLet C \u2282 P2 be a smooth elliptic curve and let P1 , P2 , P3 be three inflexion points of C, with\nLi the tangent lines at Pi to C. Taking B = C + L1 + L2 + L3 we construct the multiple\ncyclic plane with three sheets S0 associated to B and H\u221e . The curve B has three points of\ntype A5 at the Pi 's, hence n = 3, b = 6 and r = 3 in Remark 3.11 i). We have\nq(S) = h1 (P2 , I{P1 ,P2 ,P3 } (1)).\nSo, if the three inflexion points are chosen on a line, then the irregularity is 1. If the points are\nnot aligned, then the irregularity is 0. These two configurations give an example of a Zariski\npair.\n\nArtal-Bartolo's second example in [1]\nLet P be a fixed point and K = {P1 , . . . , P9 } a cluster centered at P , all its points being free.\nIt represents a curvilinear subscheme Z = ZK . In [1], Artal-Bartolo considers sextics with an\nA17 type singularity at P , with P2 , . . . , P9 the infinitely near points of the minimal resolution.\n1) If P3 lies on the line L determined by P1 and P2 and if K does not impose independent\nconditions on cubics, then all sextics are reducible. Let B be the union of two smooth cubics\nfrom |IZ (3)|, and let H\u221e be a line transverse to B. If S0 is the 3-cyclic multiple plane\nassociated to B and H\u221e , then by Remark 3.11 i),\nq(S) = h1 (P2 , IZ [3] (1)) = 1.\nSimilarly, if S0 is the 6-cyclic multiple plane, then\nq(S) = h1 (P2 , IZ [3] (1)) + h1 (P2 , IZ [6] (2)) = 2,\nsince there is no irreducible conic through Z [6] -i.e. through the points P1 , . . . , P6 - but the\ndouble line 2L: if K \u2032 = {P12 , P22 , P32 }, then Z [6] \u2282 ZK \u2032 .\nMore generally, if S0 is the n-cyclic multiple plane associated to B and H\u221e , then by the\nsame argument it follows that q(S) = 2 when n \u2261 0 mod 6, q(S) = 1 when n \u2261 3 mod 6,\nand q(S) = 0 otherwise.\n2) If P3 \u2208\n/ L and P6 \u2208 \u0393, the conic through P1 , . . . , P5 , then there exists an irreducible\nsextic with an A17 type singularity at P , such that the intersection with \u0393 is supported only\nat P . If S0 is the n-cyclic multiple plane associated to B and to a transverse line to it, then\nq(S) = h1 (P2 , IZ [6] (2)) = 1\nwhen n is divisible by 6, and q(S) = 0 otherwise.\n3) If P3 \u2208\n/ L and P6 \u2208\n/ \u0393, the conic through P1 , . . . , P5 , then, for every reduced sextic B\nwith an A17 type singularity at P , if S0 is the n-cyclic multiple plane associated to B and to\na transverse line to it, then q(S) = 0.\nRemark. In [1] it is shown that in the third case above, two configurations may appear:\neither P1 , . . . , P9 do not impose independent conditions on cubics and B is the union of two\nsmooth cubics, or the points impose independent conditions on cubics and B is irreducible.\nUsing these and the two configurations in 1) and 2), two more Zariski couples are thus produced there.\n20\n\n\fOka's example in [17]\nIn [17], when p and q are relatively prime integers, Oka constructs the curve Cp,q of degree pq\nenjoying the following property: Cp,q has pq cusp singularities each of which is locally defined\nby the equation xp + y q = 0. We shall show that the pq-multiple plane associated to Cp,q is\nirregular, the irregularity being equal to (p \u2212 1)(q \u2212 1)/2.\nWe start with the particular case p = 2, since all ideas of the general computation are\nalready present in this situation. The construction of the branching curve B = C2,2m+1 is as\nfollows. Let C \u2282 P2 be a curve of degree 2m + 1 and let \u0393 be a conic transverse to C. If f = 0\nand g = 0 are homogeneous equations for C and \u0393 respectively, then the curve B is defined\nby f 2 + g 2m+1 = 0. It is a curve of degree 4m + 2 with 4m + 2 singular points of type A2m .\nLet S0 be the (4m + 2)-cyclic multiple plane associated to B and let S be the normal cyclic\ncovering constructed in Section 2.\nClaim. q(S) = m.\nP\n1 2\nTo see this, we apply Remark 3.11 ii) to obtain q(S) = m\n\u03b1=1 h (P , IZ [\u03b1] (2m + 2\u03b1 \u2212 2)),\n[\u03b1]\n[\u03b1]\nwhere Z [\u03b1] = \u222aP ZP and ZP is the curvilinear subscheme associated to the cluster {P1 =\nP, P2 , . . . , Pm+2 }. We shall show that all the terms of the sum equal 1. To do this, we apply\nthe trace-residual exact sequence with respect to \u0393, see [8] or Remark 4.1, and obtain\n0 \u2212\u2192 IZ [\u03b1\u22121] (2m + 2\u03b1 \u2212 4) \u2212\u2192 IZ [\u03b1] (2m + 2\u03b1 \u2212 2) \u2212\u2192 OP1 (4\u03b1 \u2212 6) \u2212\u2192 0.\nSince C \u2208 |IZ [m+1] (2m + 1)|, the map H 0 (P2 , IZ [\u03b1] (2m + 2\u03b1 \u2212 2)) \u2192 H 0 (P1 , OP1 (4\u03b1 \u2212 6)) from\nthe long exact sequence in cohomology is surjective for every 1 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 m. Hence\nh1 (P2 , IZ [r] (4r \u2212 2)) = * * * = h1 (P2 , IZ [1] (2r)) = h1 (P1 , OP1 (\u22122)) = 1.\nRemark. The irregularity of the n-cyclic multiple plane associated to B and to a line\nH\u221e transversal to B, n being an arbitrary positive integer, may be computed by the same\nargument. Of course, if 2m + 1 is a prime number, then q(S) = 0 unless 4m + 2 divides n,\nsee Corollary 2.6. But if 2m + 1 is not a prime number, then irregular cyclic multiple planes\nexist for other values of n. For example, if 2m + 1 = 15 and n = 40, then\nq(S) = h1 (P2 , IZ [3] (18)) + h1 (P2 , IZ [6] (24)) = 2.\nIn the general case, if p < q, let B = Cp,q and Cp and Cq be the smooth curves of degree\np and respectively q used in the construction of B. Cp and Cq intersect transversely and if P\nis an intersection point, then B has a singularity at P given locally by an xp + y q = 0 type\nequation.\nClaim. q(S) = (p \u2212 1)(q \u2212 1)/2.\nBy Corollary 3.1,\nX\nq(S) =\n\n\u03b1,\u03b2\u22651\n\u03b1p+\u03b2q<pq\n\nh1 (P2 , IZp,q (\u03b1,\u03b2)\ng (\u22123 + \u03b1p + \u03b2q)).\n\nThe sum consists of (p \u2212 1)(q \u2212 1)/2 terms, and as before, we shall show that each of them\nequals 1. For an arbitrary couple (\u03b1, \u03b2), with \u03b1 \u2265 2, we first apply the trace-residual exact\nsequence \u03b1 \u2212 1 times with respect to Cp .

By Theorem 2.1 and using the notation from Remark 3.11, the\nirregularity is given by\nh1 (P2 , I\u03be [1] \u222aZ [2] (4)) + h1 (P2 , I\u03be [2] \u222aZ [4] (6)),\nO\n\nO\n\n[2]\n\nwhere \u03be [1] is the support of the points of type A4 and \u03be [2] = \u222aP of type A4 ZP is the support\nplus the tangent directions. Now, 10 points on a conic do not impose independent conditions\non quartics, hence the first term is 1. The second term is seen to be equal to the first\nafter applying the trace-residual exact sequence with respect to the two lines of \u0393. So the\nirregularity is 2.\nThe computations for m = 1 lead to a branching curve of degree 6 with 4 cusps and an A5\nsingularity at O. The irregularity of a 6-cyclic multiple plane is 1, given by h1 (P2 , I\u03be [1] \u222aZ [2] (2)).\nO\nIf in addition, the two lines of the degenerate conic \u0393 are brought together such that the cusps\ncollapse two by two, the branching curve has 3 A5 singularities. For a 6-multiple plane, q = 2,\nwith the contributions of the superabundance of the singularities with respect to the lines and\nthe conics both equal to 1. Necessarily, by Corollary 2.6, the branching curve is reducible; it\nis Artal-Bartolo's first example.\n\nLine arrangements following [5]\nIn this example we consider as branch curve a line arrangement B = \u222abi=1 Li \u2282 P2 that has only\nnodes and ordinary triple points as singularities. For an ordinary triple point 2/3 is the only\nsubunitary jumping number. By Corollary 3.1, if H\u221e is a line transverse to B = \u222abi=1 Li , then\nthe normal n-cyclic covering S corresponding to the n-cyclic multiple plane associated to B\nand H\u221e is irregular if and only if 3 divides both b and n, and |IZ (\u22123 + 2b\n3 )| is superabundant,\nin which case\n2b\nq(S) = h1 (P2 , IZ (\u22123 + )).\n3\nIn case S is irregular, it can be shown that the irregularity is bounded by a constant depending\non the arrangement B. More precisely, we have\nProposition 4.2. Let B = \u222abi=1 Li , H\u221e and S be as above with b and n divisible by 3. If\nti is the number of triple points lying on the line Li for each i, then\nb\n\nq(S) \u2264 min ti .\ni=1\n\nFor the proof (see [5] for a different argument), we will start with a preliminary lemma.\nLemma 4.3. If 3 divides both b and n and if one line of the arrangement contains no triple\npoint, then q(S) = 0.\nProof. Let B \u2032 be the arrangement of the b \u2212 1 lines of B except the one one with no\ntriple point. If S \u2032 is the normal n-cyclic covering corresponding to the n-cyclic multiple plane\nassociated to B \u2032 and H\u221e , then q(S \u2032 ) = 0 since 3 does not divide deg B \u2032 . Taking k = 2n/3\nand denoting by Z the support of the triple points, we obtain\n\u0019\n\u0018\n2b\n2(b \u2212 1)\n1 2\n) = h1 (P2 , IZ (\u22123 + ) = q(S).\n0 = h (P , IZ (\u22123 +\n3\n3\n\u0003\n23\n\n\fProof of Proposition 4.2. Let us S\nsuppose that L1 is the line containing the minimum\nnumber of triple points. If B \u2032 = L\u20321 \u222a i6=1 Li is a line arrangement with no triple point on\nL\u20321 , then by the previous lemma, h1 (P2 , IResL1 Z (\u22123 + 2b/3)) = 0. But\nh1 (P2 , IZ (\u22123 +\n\n2b\n2b\n)) \u2264 h1 (P2 , IResL1 Z (\u22123 + )) + card(Z \u2212 ResL1 Z) = t1 ,\n3\n3\n\nhence the result.\n\n\u0003\n\nExample. Let B be the line arrangement of 9 lines with 9 triple points represented below.\nIn a convenient affine coordinate system (x, y), the triple points that lie in the affine plane\nare the following: (0, 0), (\u00b12, \u22122), (\u22122, 0), (0, s), (2, s) and 2s/(s + 4) (\u22121, 1), with s 6= \u22122, 0\nand 2.\n\nO\n\nIt is easy to see that there are two cubics-each the union of three lines-through the 9 triple\npoints, i.e. the system of cubics through the points is superabundant. It follows that the\nirregularity of the n-cyclic multiple plane associated to B and to a line H\u221e transverse to B,\nis 1 if and only if 3 divides n.\nIf s = 2, then the arrangement specialize to an arrangement with 10 triple points, 4 of\nthem lying on the line x + y = 0. But these points lie on a cubic, the union of three of the\nlines of B, and again h1 (P2 , IZ (3)) = 1, hence the irregularity is 1 in this case too.\nRemark 4.4. The irregularity depends on the position of the line H\u221e with respect to B.\nTo see this, let B be the line arragement below of 5 lines with 2 triple points.\n\nQ\nP\n\nIf H\u221e is transverse to B, then the irregularity of the 6-cyclic multiple plane is 0. But if H\u221e\nis the line through the double points P and Q then the irregularity jumps to 1.\n\n24\n\n\fReferences\n[1] E. Artal-Bartolo, Sur les couples de Zariski. J.
