Hilbert showed that for most (n, m) there exist psd forms p(x1 , . . . , xn )\nof degree m which cannot be written as a sum of squares of forms. His 17th problem\nasked whether, in this case, there exists a form h so that h2 p is a sum of squares of\nforms; that is, p is a sum of squares of rational functions with denominator h. We\nshow that, for every such (n, m) there does not exist a single form h which serves\nin this way as a denominator for every psd p(x1 , . . . , xn ) of degree m.\n\n1. Introduction\nLet Hd (Rn ) denote the set of real homogeneous forms of degree\nd in n variables (\"n\u0001\nary d-ics\") . By identifying p \u2208 Hd (Rn ) with the N = n+d\u22121\n-tuple\nof its coefficients,\nn\u22121\nn\nN\nwe see that Hd (R ) \u2248 R . Suppose m is an even integer. A form p \u2208 Hm (Rn ) is called\npositive semidefinite or psd if p(x1 , . . . , xn ) \u2265 0 for all (x1 , . . . , xn ) \u2208 Rn . Following\n[1], we denote the set of psd forms in Hm (Rn ) by Pn,m . Since Pn,m is closed under\naddition and closed under multiplication by positive scalars, it is a convex cone. In\nfact, Pn,m is a closed convex cone: if pn \u2192 p coefficient-wise, and each pn is psd, then\nso is p. A psd form is called positive definite or pd if p(x1 , . . . , xn ) = 0 implies xj = 0\nfor 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n. The pd n-ary m-ics are the interior of the cone Pn,m.\nA form p \u2208 Hm (Rn ) is called a sum ofP\nsquares or sos if it can be written as a sum\nof squares of polynomials; that is, p = k h2k . It is easy to show in this case that\neach hk \u2208 Hm/2 (Rn ). Again following [1], we denote the set of sos forms in Hm (Rn )\nby \u03a3n,m . Clearly, \u03a3n,m is a convex cone; less obviously, it is a closed cone, a result\ndue to R. M. Robinson [20].\nIn light of the inclusion \u03a3n,m \u2286 Pn,m , let \u2206n,m = Pn,m \\ \u03a3n,m . It was well-known\nby the late 19th century that Pn,m = \u03a3n,m when m = 2 or n = 2. In 1888, Hilbert\nproved [8] that \u03a33,4 = P3,4 ; more specifically, every p \u2208 P3,4 can be written as the\nsum of three squares of quadratic forms. (An elementary proof, with \"five\" squares is\nin [2, pp.16-17]; for modern expositions of Hilbert's proof, see [24] and [21].) Hilbert\nalso proved in [8] that the preceding are the only cases for which \u2206n,m = \u2205. That is,\nDate: May 12, 2003.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Suppose p \u2208 P3,m with m \u2265 6. Then there exist p1 \u2208 P3,m\u22124 and\nh1k \u2208 Hm\u22122 (R3 ), 1 \u2264 k \u2264 3, so that\np1 p = h211 + h212 + h213 .\n(Hilbert's proof seems to be non-constructive, and lacks a modern exposition. In\nthe very recent paper [10], de Klerk and Pasechnik discuss the implementation of\nan algorithm to find p1 so that p1 p is sos, though not necessarily as a sum of three\nsquares. This paper uses Hilbert's result without giving an independent proof.)\nIf m = 6 or 8, then p1 is a sum of three squares of forms, and hence (as Landau\nlater noted [11]), the four-square identity implies that p21 p = p1 (p1 p) is the sum of\nfour squares of forms. If m \u2265 10, then the argument can be applied to p1 : there\nexists p2 \u2208 P3,m\u22128 with p2 p1 = h221 + h222 + h223 . Thus, if m = 10 or 12 (so that\nP3,m\u22128 = \u03a33,m\u22128 ), then (p1 p2 )2 p = p2 (p2 p1 )(p1 p) is the sum of four squares of forms,\n2\nAn easy induction shows that there exists q \u2208 Ht (R3 ) with t = \u230a (m\u22122)\n\u230b so that q 2 p\n8\nis the sum of four squares of forms.\nHilbert's 17th Problem asked whether this generalizes to n > 3 variables; that is,\nif p \u2208 Pn,m, must there exist some form q so that q 2 p is sos? Artin proved that there\nmust be, in a way that gives no information about q. Much more on the history of\nthis subject can be found in the survey paper [19].\nThis discussion leads to two closely related questions. Suppose p \u2208 Pn,m . Can we\nfind a form h such that hp is sos? Can we find a form q so that q 2 p is sos? If we've\nanswered the second, we've answered the first. Conversely, if p 6= 0 is psd and hp is\nsos, then h is psd. But it needn't be sos; indeed, a trivial answer to the first question\nis to take h = p. Stengle proved [23] that if p(x, y, z) = x3 z 3 + (y 2z \u2212 x3 \u2212 z 2 x)2 , then\np2s+1 \u2208 \u22063,6(2s+1) for every integer s. That is, p2s\u22121 * p is sos, but p2s * p is not. Choi\nand Lam showed [1] that for S \u2208 \u22063,6 (see (3) below), the product S(x, y, z)S(x, z, y)\nis actually sos.\nThe author gratefully acknowledges correspondence with Chip Delzell, Pablo Parrilo, Vicki Powers, Marie-Fran\u00e7oise Roy and Claus Scheiderer. Their suggestions have\nmade this a better paper.\n2. What is known about the denominator\nThe first concrete result about a denominator in Hilbert's 17th Problem was\nfound by P\u00f3lya [16]. He showed\nthat if f \u2208 Hd (Rn ) is positive on P\nthe unit simP\nplex {(x1 , . . . , xn ) | xj \u2265 0, xj = 1}, then for sufficiently large N, ( j xj )N f has\npositive coefficients. Replacing each xj by x2j , we see that if p \u2208 H2d (Rn ) is an even\nP\npositive definite form, then ( j x2j )N p is a sum of even monomials with positive coefficients, and so, P\nas it stands, is a sum of squares of monomials. Taking even N,\nwe see that q = ( j x2j )N/2 is a denominator for p. Habicht [6] generalized P\u00f3lya's\n\n\fON THE ABSENCE OF UNIFORM DENOMINATORS IN HILBERT'S 17TH PROBLEM\n\n3\n\nproof to give an alternate solution to Hilbert's 17th Problem for pd forms;\nP 2 however,\nh is not readily constructible and in general is no longer a power of\nxj . Except\nfor one example, P\u00f3lya did not attempt to determine an explicit value of N. A good\nexposition of the theorems of P\u00f3lya and Habicht can be found in [7].\nFor positive definite p \u2208 Pn,m , let\n\u01eb(p) :=\n\ninf{p(u) : u \u2208 S n\u22121 }\nsup{p(u) : u \u2208 S n\u22121 }\n\nmeasure how \"close\" p is to having a zero. The author [18] showed that if\nN\u2265\n\nnm(m \u2212 1)\nn+m\n\u2212\n,\n(4 log 2)\u01eb(p)\n2\n\nP\nthen ( j x2j )N p is a sum of (m + 2N)-th powers of linear forms, and so is sos. A\nsimilar lower bound has been shown to apply in P\u00f3lya's case, one which goes to\ninfinity as p approaches the boundary of Pn,m . (See papers by de Loera and Santos\n[12] and by Powers and the author [17].)\nThe restriction to positive definite forms is necessary. There exist psd forms p in\nn \u2265 4 variables so that, if h2 p is sos, then h must have a specified zero. The existence\nP\nof these unavoidable singularities, or so-called \"bad points\", insures that ( x2j )r p\ncan never be a sum of squares of forms for any r. Habicht's Theorem implies that no\npositive definite form can have a bad point. Bad points were first noted by Straus\nand have been extensively studied by Delzell; see, e.g. [4, 5].\n3. Recent results and a new theorem\nScheiderer has shown in very recent work [22] that for p \u2208 P3,m , there exists\nN = N(p) so that (x2 + y 2 + z 2 )N p(x, y, z) is sos; indeed, x2 + y 2 + z 2 can be replaced\nby any positive definite form. This is a strong refutation to the existence of bad\npoints for ternary forms.\nAlso very recently, Lombardi and Roy [13] have constructed a quantitative version\nof the Positivstellensatz. A special case is that for fixed (n, m), there exists d =\nd(n, m) so that if p \u2208 Pn,m , there exists q \u2208 Hd (Rn ) so that q 2 p is sos.\nSuppose (n, m) is such that \u2206n,m 6= \u2205. Theorem 1 below states that there is no\nsingle form h so that, if p \u2208 Pn,m , then hp is sos. Corollary 2 says that there is not\neven a finite set of forms H so that, if p \u2208 Pn,m , then there exists h \u2208 H so that hp\nin sos. In particular, there does not exist a finite set of denominators which apply\nto all of Pn,m . This result implies that N(p) in Scheiderer's theorem is not bounded\nas p ranges over P3,m . It also implies that the denominators in the Lombardi-Roy\ntheorem cannot be chosen from a finite, predetermined set.\nThe proof of the Theorem is elementary and relies on a few simple observations.\nIf p 6= 0 is psd and hp is sos, then h is psd. As previously noted, \u03a3n,m is a closed\ncone for all (n, m). This cone is invariant under the action of taking invertible linear\nchanges of form. Thus, if h\u2032 is derived from h by such a linear change, and if hp is sos\n\n\f4\n\nBRUCE REZNICK\n\nP\nfor every p \u2208 Pn,m , then so is h\u2032 p. Suppose l is a linear form, p = j gk2 is sos, and\nl | p. Then l2 | p and l | gk for each k, and by induction, l2s | p =\u21d2 ls | gk . Thus, we\ncan \"peel off\" squares of linear factors from any sos form; this is a common practice,\ndating back at least to [20, p. 267]. We use this observation in the contrapositive: if\np \u2208 \u2206n,m , then l2s p \u2208 \u2206n,m+2s .\nTheorem 1. Suppose \u2206n,m 6= \u2205. Then there does not exist a non-zero form h so that\nif p \u2208 Pn,m , then hp is sos.\nProof. Suppose to the contrary that such a form h exists. Since h 6= 0, there exists\na point a \u2208 Rn so that h(a) 6= 0. By making an invertible linear change of variables,\nwe can take a = (1, 0, . . . , 0). Thus, we may assume without loss of generality that\nh(x1 , 0, . . . , 0) = \u03b1xd1 , where \u03b1 > 0 and d is even. In the sequel, we distinguish x1\nfrom the other variables.\nChoose p \u2208 Pn,m \\ \u03a3n,m . Then\nh(x1 , x2 , . . . , xn )p(x1 , rx2 , . . . , rxn )\nis sos for every r \u2208 N. By making the change of variables xi \u2192 xi /r for i \u2265 2, we see\nthat\nh(x1 , r \u22121 x2 , . . . , r \u22121xn )p(x1 , x2 , . . . , xn )\nis also sos. Since\nlim h(x1 , r \u22121 x2 , . . . , r \u22121xn ) = h(x1 , 0, . . . , 0) = \u03b1xd1 ,\n\nr\u2192\u221e\n\nand since \u03a3n,m+d is closed, it follows that\nlim h(x1 , r \u22121x2 , . . . , r \u22121 xn )p(x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) = \u03b1xd1 p(x1 , . . . , xn )\n\nr\u2192\u221e\n\nis sos. Thus p is sos, a contradiction.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe following elegant proof is due to Claus Scheiderer and is included with his\npermission; it supersedes the proof in an earlier version of this manuscript.\nCorollary 2. Suppose \u2206n,m 6= \u2205. Then there does not exist a finite set of non-zero\nforms H = {h1 , ..., hN } with the property that, if p \u2208 Pn,m , then hk p is sos for some\nhk \u2208 H.\nProof. Suppose H exists. For each k, there exists non-zero p \u2208 \u2206n,m so that hk p is\nsos. (Otherwise, we may delete hk harmlessly from H.)\nQ Thus, each hk is psd, and\nthere exists a form qk so that qk2 hk is sos. Define h = k qk2 hk . We now show that\nfor every p \u2208 Pn,m, hp is sos: this contradicts the Theorem and proves the Corollary.\nBy hypothesis, there exists hj \u2208 H so that hj p is sos. Thus,\n!\nY\nqk2 hk * qj2 * hj p\nhp =\nk6=j\n\nis a product of sos factors, and so is sos.\n\n\u0003\n\n\fON THE ABSENCE OF UNIFORM DENOMINATORS IN HILBERT'S 17TH PROBLEM\n\n5\n\nFinally, we know by Hilbert's theorem that for p \u2208 P3,6 , there exists quadratic h\nso that hp \u2208 \u03a33,8 . The three simplest forms in \u22063,6 are\n(1)\n\nM(x, y, z) = x4 y 2 + x2 y 4 + z 6 \u2212 3x2 y 2z 2 ,\n\ndue to Motzkin [14];\n\nRobinson's [20] simplification of Hilbert's construction\n(2) R(x, y, z) = x6 + y 6 + z 6 \u2212 (x4 y 2 + x2 y 4 + x4 z 2 + x2 z 4 + y 4 z 2 + y 2 z 4 ) + 3x2 y 2z 2 ;\nand\n(3)\n\nS(x, y, z) = x4 y 2 + y 4z 2 + z 4 x2 \u2212 3x2 y 2 z 2 ,\n\ndue to Choi and Lam [1, 2].\n\nIt is not too difficult to consider qM, qR, qS for q(x, y, z) = a2 x2 + b2 y 2 + c2 z 2 , and\ndetermine whether these are sos using the algorithm of [3] directly or its implementation in, e.g., [15].\nInterestingly enough, these conditions are the same in each case: the forms are sos\nif and only if\n2(a2 b2 + a2 c2 + b2 c2 ) \u2265 a4 + b4 + c4 .\nThis expression factors rather neatly into:\n(a + b + c)(a + b \u2212 c)(b + c \u2212 a)(c + a \u2212 b) \u2265 0,\nso if a \u2265 b \u2265 c \u2265 0 without loss of generality, the only non-trivial condition is that\nb+c \u2265 a; that is, there is a (possibly degenerate) triangle with sides a, b, c. (Robinson\n[20, p. 273] has a superficially similar condition, but note that his multiplier is\nax2 + by 2 + cz 2 .)\nBy specializing this result and scaling variables as in the proof of the theorem, we\nnote that\n(x2 + y 2 + z 2 )M(x, \u03bby, \u03bbz), (x2 + y 2 + z 2 )R(x, \u03bby, \u03bbz), (x2 + y 2 + z 2 )S(x, \u03bby, \u03bbz)\nare sos if and only if 0 \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 2.\nReferences\n[1] Choi, M.
