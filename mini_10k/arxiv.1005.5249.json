It is thought likely that vast numbers of nanoflares are responsible for the corona having a temperature of millions of\ndegrees. Current observational technologies lack the resolving power to confirm the nanoflare hypothesis. An alternative approach is\nto construct a magnetohydrodynamic coronal loop model that has the ability to predict nanoflare energy distributions.\nAims. This paper presents the initial results generated by a coronal loop model that flares whenever it becomes unstable to an ideal\nMHD kink mode. A feature of the model is that it predicts heating events with a range of sizes, depending on where the instability\nthreshold for linear kink modes is encountered. The aims are to calculate the distribution of event energies and to investigate whether\nkink instability can be predicted from a single parameter.\nMethods. The loop is represented as a straight line-tied cylinder. The twisting caused by random photospheric motions is captured by\ntwo parameters, representing the ratio of current density to field strength for specific regions of the loop. Instability onset is mapped\nas a closed boundary in the 2D parameter space. Dissipation of the loop's magnetic energy begins during the nonlinear stage of the\ninstability, which develops as a consequence of current sheet reconnection. After flaring, the loop evolves to the state of lowest energy\nwhere, in accordance with relaxation theory, the ratio of current to field is constant throughout the loop and helicity is conserved.\nResults. There exists substantial variation in the radial magnetic twist profiles for the loop states along the instability threshold. These\nresults suggest that instability cannot be predicted by any simple twist-derived property reaching a critical value. The model is applied\nsuch that the loop undergoes repeated episodes of instability followed by energy-releasing relaxation. Hence, an energy distribution\nof the nanoflares produced is collated. This paper also presents the calculated relaxation states and energy releases for all instability\nthreshold points.\nConclusions. The final energy distribution features two nanoflare populations that follow different power laws. The power law index\nfor the higher energy population is more than sufficient for coronal heating.\nKey words.

Introduction\nThe idea that nanoflares are sufficiently numerous to maintain\ncoronal temperatures was first proposed by Parker (1988). This\ntheory implies that the coronal background emission is the result\nof nanoflares occurring continually throughout the solar atmosphere. Hence, it is probably unfeasible to observe these flares\nindividually. This perhaps explains why observational studies\nhave failed to agree on the importance of nanoflares with regard to coronal heating (Krucker & Benz 1998; Parnell & Jupp\n2000; Aschwanden & Parnell 2002; Parnell 2004). The impracticality of nanoflare detection has motivated the development of\nmodels that attempt to show how coronal loops might dissipate\ntheir magnetic energy in the form of discrete heating events and\nthereby replenish coronal heating losses. The primary dissipation mechanism is thought to be magnetic reconnection, since\nstrong evidence of this process has been found in observations\nof large-scale flares (Fletcher 2009; Qiu 2009). Coronal heating\nrequires fast dissipation of magnetic energy, a requirement that\nis compatible with reconnection timescales.\nA loop's excess magnetic energy is introduced via the random convective motions that occur at or below the loop's photospheric boundaries (i.e., footpoints). There are two possibilSend offprint requests to: P. K. Browning\n\nities for how the kinetic energy of these motions is dissipated\nwithin the loop (Klimchuk 2006). Direct current (DC) heating occurs when the Alfv\u00e9n time is small compared to the\ntimescale of photospheric turbulence. Thus, the loop moves\nquasi-statically through a series of force-free equilibria until the\naccumulating magnetic stresses are dissipated as heat. If the\nAlfv\u00e9n time is slow compared to photospheric motions, alternating current (AC) heating takes place: footpoint motions generate\nwaves (acoustic and MHD), some of which may deposit energy\nwithin the coronal loop. The waves that can penetrate the corona\nare thought to be restricted by type and frequency (Narain &\nUlmschieder 1996; Hollweg 1984). Whether or not these waves\ncarry sufficient energy to heat the corona is not certain (Porter\net al. 1994). There is considerably less doubt, however, over the\nsufficiency of DC heating, which is the basis for the model presented here. (AC heating may still be partly reponsible for coronal heating: the reconnection mechanism mentioned above may\ngenerate waves within the corona.)\nThe coronal part of the loop is defined by its magnetic\nfield (plasma beta, \u03b2 \u2248 0.01) and, since the loop's magnetic flux\nand plasma are frozen together, its magnetic field is continually twisted by random swirling motions at the photosphere. If\nthe driving is slow compared to Alfv\u00e9n timescales, the loop's\nforce-free state can be represented by \u2207 \u00d7 B = \u03b1(r)B, where\n\n\f2\n\nM. R. Bareford et al.: The Energy Distribution of Nanoflares\n\n\u03b1 = (\u03bc0 j * B)/(|B|2 ) is the ratio of current density to magnetic\nfield and r is a position vector (Woltjer 1958).\nMany 3D MHD models have shown how such coronal loops\nexhibit current sheet formation during the nonlinear phase of\nan ideal kink instability (Baty & Heyvaerts 1996; Velli et al.\n1997; Arber et al. 1999; Baty 2000). Essentially, helical current\nsheets become the site of Ohmic dissipation, resulting in a heating event. Further simulations have revealed the appropriate correlation between magnetic energy and Ohmic heating (Browning\n& Van der Linden 2003; Browning et al. 2008; Hood et al. 2009).\nThe energy released by an instability depends on the complex\ndynamics of the magnetic reconnection events that occur inside\nthe loop. Obviously, this is difficult to model - although this has\nbeen achieved by 3D MHD simulations. The computational expense of these simulations rules them out as a means of exploring fully the relationship between the \u03b1-profile and the amount\nof energy released. Fortunately, there is another way to calculate\nthe energy release.\nRelaxation theory states that when a magnetic field reaches\ninstability (or is otherwise disrupted) it will evolve towards a\nminimum energy state such that the total magnetic axial flux and\nthe global magnetic helicity are conserved (Taylor 1974, 1986).\nThe relaxed state is the well known constant-\u03b1 or linear forcefree field:\n\u2207 \u00d7 B = \u03b1B.\n\n(1)\n\nThe original intention of this theory was to explain laboratory\nplasma phenomena; but latterly, it has been frequently applied to\nthe solar corona (Heyvaerts & Priest 1984; Browning et al. 1986;\nVekstein et al. 1993; Zhang & Low 2003; Priest et al. 2005).\nThe helicity measures the self-linkage of the magnetic field, see\nBerger (1999). A modified expression for this quantity needs to\nbe used since the field lines cross the photospheric boundaries,\nwhich creates non-zero normal flux and therefore removes gauge\ninvariance.\nZ\n( A + A\u2032 ) * (B \u2212 B \u2032 ) dV,\n(2)\nK =\nV\n\nwhere A is the magnetic potential, B \u2032 is the potential field with\nthe same boundary conditions and A\u2032 is the corresponding vector potential. This relative helicity (Berger & Field 1984; Finn\n& Antonsen 1985) is the difference between the helicity of the\nactual field and that of a potential field (represented by the dash\nterms) with the same normal flux distribution. In ideal MHD,\nthe helicity of every flux region is conserved. Taylor proposed\nthat in the presence of reconnection all such local invariants\nare destroyed, whilst the global helicity is conserved. Helicity\nis still affected by global resistive diffusion, however, it can still\nbe treated as a conserved quantity, if the change in helicity is\nsubstantially smaller than the change in magnetic energy. The\nresults of one aforementioned MHD simulation (Browning et al.\n2008) have shown that \u03b4K/K \u223c 10\u22124 and \u03b4W/W \u223c 10\u22122 (it should\nbe noted that these figures are limited by the coarseness of the\nnumerical grid used in the simulation). During relaxation, helicity is redistributed more evenly within the loop; as a consequence\n\u03b1 becomes invariant with radius. These properties enable one to\nlocate a loop's relaxed state and hence calculate the energy released during relaxation, i.e., the upper limit of the flare energy.\nIn applying relaxation theory to coronal heating, it became\nclear that the effectiveness of the heating depends on how much\nfree energy is stored before a relaxation event occurs (Heyvaerts\n& Priest 1984). Browning & Van der Linden (2003) proposed\nthat relaxation is triggered by the onset of ideal MHD instability. Thus, the coronal field evolves quasi-statically in response\n\nto slow photospheric driving, building up free magnetic energy\n- until the field becomes unstable (i.e., the threshold for linear\ninstability is reached). At this point, a dynamic heating event\nensues. It should be noted that ideal instabilities are relevant (as\nopposed to resistive instabilities) because the time-scales are sufficiently fast. Dissipation and energy release can occur during\nthe nonlinear phase of the instability, as has been demonstrated\nextensively by numerical simulations of the nonlinear kink instability (Galsgaard & Nordlund 1997; Velli et al. 1997; Lionello et\nal. 1998; Baty 2000; Gerrard et al. 2001). The helical deformation of the kink instability generates current sheets in the nonlinear regime, in which fast magnetic reconnection rapidly dissipates magnetic energy. Recently, it has been demonstrated using\n3D MHD simulations that this process causes the field to relax\ntowards a state which is closely-approximated as a constant-\u03b1\nstate, and the energy release is in good agreement with relaxation\ntheory (Browning et al. 2008; Hood et al. 2009). These papers\nhave investigated field profiles, based on the model of Browning\n& Van der Linden (2003), in the unstable region of parameter\nspace and have shown that fast reconnection develops in a current sheet, with dissipation of magnetic energy and relaxation to\na new, lower-energy state. Efficient \"mixing\" of the \u03b1 profile is\nfacilitated in the later phases of the evolution, during which the\ncurrent sheet fragments (Hood et al. 2009).\nSupported by this evidence, the model developed here is\nbased on the idea that coronal magnetic fields respond to photospheric driving by evolving through force-free equilibria, with\na heating event triggered whenever the ideal instability threshold is reached. Following Browning & Van der Linden (2003),\nwe use a simple cylindrical field model, and represent the nonlinear force-free field using a two-parameter family of current profiles in which \u03b1 is a piecewise constant. Browning and Van der\nLinden considered only individual heating events. The primary\naim of this paper is to predict a distribution of heating events,\ngenerated by an ongoing stress-relax cycle. The photospheric\ndriving stresses the coronal magnetic field until it becomes unstable and relaxes; then the driving resumes, and the process repeats, leading to a series of heating events as expected in the\nnanoflare coronal heating scenario. This is modelled through a\nmonte-carlo approach, with the photospheric footpoint motions\ntreated as random. Recent observational evidence (Abramenko\net al. 2006) lends support to the idea that random, turbulent photospheric motions can provide an energy source for coronal heating in Active Regions.\nIn calculating the relaxation and distribution of heating\nevents, we need to know the linear instability threshold for linetied coronal loops over a family of field profiles. As a consequence, we obtain some interesting new results concerning stability properties of cylindrical loops, for a much more extensive\nrange of current profiles than previously studied (including profiles for which the sense of the twist of the field varies across the\nloop). A secondary aim is thus to explore the properties of the\nlinear kink instability on this family of fields, and in particular,\nto determine the extent to which stability can be defined by any\nsingle quantity such as \"critical twist\".\nThe paper is structured in the following manner. Section 2\ndescribes the composition of the loop model, along with the\nequations used to express the loop's magnetic field. The calculation of the loop's instability threshold is also explained, as well\nas the procedure for allowing the loop to repeatedly undergo instability and the equations used to determine the energy release\nassociated with each relaxation. Section 3 outlines the analysis\nof possible critical parameter values for the onset of loop instability. The results of the simulations of energy release are pre-\n\n\fM. R. Bareford et al.: The Energy Distribution of Nanoflares\n\nsented in Sect. 4 as nanoflare energy distributions. Finally, in\nthe last section, the results are discussed and our conclusions are\ngiven.\n\n2. Model\nThe model discussed here was used by Browning & Van der\nLinden (2003) and then extended by Browning et al. (2008) to\ninclude a potential envelope (Fig. 1). First, a loop is consid-\n\nFig. 1. Schematic of a straightened coronal loop in the r-\u03b8 plane (left)\nand in the r-z plane (right). The loop, comprises a core (dark grey)\nand an outer layer (light grey); it is embedded in a potential envelope\n(white). The core radius is half the loop radius and 1/6 the envelope\nradius (R1 :R2 :R3 = 0.5:1:3). The loop's aspect ratio (L/R2 ) is 20.\n\nered to evolve through equilibria as it is driven by photospheric\nfootpoint motions. An idealised model of a straight cylindrical\nloop is used with the photosphere represented by two planes\nat z = 0, L; however, the essential physics should apply to more\ncomplex geometries. The stressed field is line-tied with (in general) a non-uniform \u03b1(r) (where \u03b1 = \u03bc0 jk /B). This is represented by a two-parameter family of piecewise-constant-\u03b1 profiles. Secondly, it is proposed that a relaxation event is triggered\nwhen the loop's field becomes linearly unstable. The energy released, due to fast magnetic reconnection during the nonlinear\ndevelopment of the instability, can then be calculated using relaxation theory.\nThe MHD kink instability needs to be ideal in order to\nbe consistent with the observed rapidity of flare occurrences.\nHowever, ideal conditions mean there is no resitivity to dissipate magnetic energy; the 3D MHD simulations discussed in the\nIntroduction provide a solution to this impasse. Once a linear\ninstability has achieved a positive growth rate, it will soon become nonlinear: at this point, current sheets will form wherein\nfast reconnection of the magnetic field can take place. These\nexpectations are justified by the results of the cited numerical simulations. The linear perturbation can be represented as\nf = f \u0303(r, z)ei\u03b8 e\u03b3t , where the azimuthal mode number is set to 1;\nthis mode has been found to be the least stable (Van der Linden\n& Hood 1999). The effect of such perturbations on the coronal\nloop are represented by the standard set of linearised ideal MHD\nequations.\n\n3\n\n2.1. Equilibrium fields\n\nThe loop's radial \u03b1-profile is approximated by a piecewiseconstant function featuring two parameters. This design, first\nproposed by Melrose et al. (1994), is readily extensible: extra\nlayers of constant \u03b1 can be inserted to obtain more realistic profiles. The ratio of current to magnetic field is \u03b11 in the core, \u03b12\nin the outer layer and zero in the potential envelope. Note that\nthe magnetic field is continuous everywhere (though the current\nhas discontinuities). Recent work indicates that these \u03b1 discontinuities have little discernable effect when compared to similar\nbut continuous \u03b1-profiles (Hood et al. 2009).\nWithout an envelope, the loop's outer surface (located at R2 )\nacts as a conducting wall. This is unrealistic in the context of\nthe solar corona; the loop would be more stable than it might\nbe otherwise. Browning et al. (2008) plotted the relationship between the growth rate of the instability and the distance to the\nouter surface of the potential envelope (i.e., a more distant conducting wall). They found that for six unstable loop states the\ngrowth rate was invariant once the outer surface of the envelope\n(R3 ) exceeded 23 R2 . The R3 boundary was placed at twice this\nvalue.\nThe fields are expressed in terms of the well-known Bessel\nfunction model, generalised to the concentric layer geometry (Melrose et al. 1994; Browning & Van der Linden 2003;\nBrowning et al. 2008). These expressions will change slightly\nwhenever \u03b11 or \u03b12 become negative; these alterations are captured by \u03c3 symbols: \u03c31 = |\u03b1\u03b111 | , \u03c32 = |\u03b1\u03b122 | and \u03c31,2 = \u03c31 \u03c32 .\n(The sign of an \u03b1 term merely denotes the orientation of the\nazimuthal field). Thus, the field equations for the three regions\n(core, outer layer and potential envelope) are as follows:\nB1z = B1 J0 (|\u03b11 |r),\nB1\u03b8 = \u03c31 B1 J1 (|\u03b11 |r),\nB2z = B2 J0 (|\u03b12 |r) + C2 Y0 (|\u03b12 |r),\nB2\u03b8 = \u03c32 (B2 J1 (|\u03b12 |r) + C2 Y1 (|\u03b12 |r)),\nB3z = B3 ,\nC3\nB3\u03b8 = \u03c32 R2 ,\nr\n\n(3)\n0 \u2264 r \u2264 R1 , (4)\n(5)\nR1 \u2264 r \u2264 R2 , (6)\n(7)\nR2 \u2264 r \u2264 R3 .

Hence, in\nthe model, \u03c8\u2217 is normalised to 1 and B1 can be determined (noting that, in equation 15, B2 is a function of B1 ). We also normalise with respect to the coronal loop radius, R2 , see Fig. 1.\nAs the random motions of the photosphere proceed, the loop\nevolves through a series of force-free equilibrium states until it\nbecomes linearly unstable. We now discuss the calculation of the\ninstability onset.\n2.2. Linear kink instability threshold\n\n4\n\n4\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1\n\n2.5\n\u03b12\n\n\u03b12\n\nA coronal loop's instability is constrained by the line-tying of\nthe photospheric footpoints (Hood 1992). Hence, all perturbations are required to vanish at the loop ends (z = 0, L). When\nthe growth rate of a perturbation transitions from a negative\nvalue to a positive one, the loop has reached the threshold of\nan ideal linear instability. The instability threshold is a curve\nin 2-dimensional \u03b1-space (\u03b11 , \u03b12 ). The properties of the loop\n(e.g., \u03b11 and \u03b12 ) at these threshold points can be found by substituting the perturbation function into the linearised MHD equations, leading to an eigenvalue equation for the growth rates\n(Chap. 7, Priest 1987). The growth rates and eigenfunctions of\nthe most unstable modes are found numerically, for line-tied\nfields, with the CILTS code, described in Browning & Van der\nLinden (2003) and Browning et al. (2008). CILTS can be configured such that one of the loop's \u03b1 parameters is fixed whilst the\nother is incremented. The code terminates as soon as the real part\nof the eigenfunction falls below zero, i.e., the loop is no longer\nunstable to kink perturbations. The left panel of Fig. 2 shows the\nclosed instability threshold curve mapped by the CILTS code\n(see also Fig. 5 of Browning et al. 2008). The threshold curve\nhas symmetry: it is invariant when rotated by \u03c0 radians. Thus,\nit is sufficient to show how various properties (e.g., magnetic\ntwist and energy release) vary along the top half of the threshold curve. For ease of plotting we can convert this half of the\nthreshold curve to a one dimensional form: the filled circles and\nbold numbers shown in the right panel of Fig. 2 represent the tic\nmarks and labels for the 1D threshold point axis, see Figs. 8 - 11.\n\n0\n-1\n\n40\n60\n80\n\n20\n\n2\n1.5\n\n-2\n\n1\n\n-3\n\n0.5\n\n-4\n\n100\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\u03b11\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n120\n\n0\n\n0\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\u03b11\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nFig. 2. The left panel shows the closed instability threshold (solid) with\nthe Bz reversal lines (dashed). The top half of the threshold (where \u03b12 >\n0), annotated with threshold point numbers, is shown in the right panel.\n\nIt is important to remember that the threshold only applies\nto the specific loop geometry outlined above. A new threshold\nwould need to be calculated should the loop's proportions, composition or envelope change as a consequence of some activ-\n\nity. Another caveat is that there are some points in \u03b1-space that\nyield singularities when calculating quantities such as helicity\nor magnetic energy. These arise when the axial field (Bz ) has a\nsignificant region of reversal; since \u03c8\u2217 is normalised to 1 and\nconserved, the helicity and energy terms will diverge when unnormalised \u03c8\u2217 \u2192 0 (see Browning & Van der Linden 2003).\nFortunately, the instability threshold does not enter the region\nwhere Bz begins to pass through zero (see dashed lines in Fig.\n2), so these singularities are not encountered.\n2.3. Random walk\n\nWhen a loop is twisted by turbulent photospheric motions, it\nperforms a random walk through the \u03b1-space enclosed by the\ninstability threshold (Fig. 3). This traversal of \u03b1-space is random in direction but constant in length (we set the dimensionless step-length to be \u03b4\u03b1 = 0.1 for most of the results presented\nhere). Clearly, the nature of this random walk depends on the\nstatistical properties of the driving photospheric motions; in future, different forms of this random driving will be investigated,\nbut for now, we take the simplest assumptions.\nThe time unit \u03c4 is the step time, the time taken for \u03b1 to change\nby 0.1/R2 (in dimensional units). We may estimate, roughly,\na timescale for this process as follows. Based on axial values, a change \u03b4\u03b1 corresponds to a change in magnetic twist\n\u03b4\u03c6 \u2248 (L/2)(\u03b4\u03b1/R2); taking L/R2 = 20 gives \u03b4\u03c6 \u2248 1. If this is caused\nby photospheric twisting motions of magnitude v\u03b8 for a time interval \u03c4, we find \u03c4 \u2248 (\u03b4\u03c6)R f /v\u03b8 , where R f is the footpoint radius.\nWith typical values of R f = 200 km and v\u03b8 = 1 km s\u22121 , we obtain\n\u03c4 \u2248 200 s; note that this is consistent with quasi-static evolution,\njustifying a posteriori our choice of random-walk step size. The\nstep time (\u03c4) may be identified with the correlation time of photospheric motions, which is likely to be rather longer than the\nvalue given above; for example, a granule lifetime of 1000 s may\nbe appropriate (Zirker & Cleveland 1993). The effect of increasing the step length (\u03b4\u03b1) is considered in Sect. 4.2.3\nEventually, the field will reach the instability threshold: it\nwill become linearly unstable. At this point, the field releases\nenergy and transitions to a lower-energy state defined by Taylor\nrelaxation: helicity is conserved and the \u03b1-profile relaxes to a\nsingle value.\n2.4. Energy release calculation\n\nWe have extended the model (Browning & Van der Linden 2003;\nBrowning et al. 2008) to allow a loop to repeatedly undergo relaxation as it evolves within \u03b1-space. Initially, a loop starts from\na randomly-selected stable state. The field profile then undergoes\na random walk until it crosses the instability threshold; whereupon, the loop relaxes and the profile transitions to the relaxation line (\u03b11 = \u03b12 ). The constant \u03b1-value (\u03b1rx ) will, of course,\nvary depending on where the threshold was crossed; \u03b1rx is found\nby helicity conservation (Browning & Van der Linden 2003). In\nmathematical terms, we find the roots of the following equation:\nK(\u03b1rx ) \u2212 K(\u03b1it1 , \u03b1it2 ) = 0,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere \u03b1it1 and \u03b1it2 are the coordinates of the instability threshold crossing (conservation of axial flux is assured through the\nnormalisation \u03c8\u2217 = 1). The helicity can be expressed as follows:\nZ R3\nI\u03c8(r)\nK = 2L\ndr,\n(17)\nr\n0\nwhere I is the current and L is the loop length (Finn & Antonsen\n1985). The equation for the magnetic energy contained within\n\n\fM. R. Bareford et al.: The Energy Distribution of Nanoflares\n\n3.

The energy difference\nbetween the unstable and relaxed states can be calculated thus:\n\u03b4W = W(\u03b1it1 , \u03b1it2 ) \u2212 W(\u03b1rx ).\n\n(19)\n\nThis is the relaxation energy: the energy released as heat during\nthe event.\nAfter relaxation, the loop resumes its random walk until it\nreaches the threshold and the process repeats. Fig. 3 gives an illustration of this process. We thus generate a sequence of energy\n\nThe evolution of the field profile through \u03b1-space is determined\nby photospheric perturbations which map to changes in the magnetic field and hence to changes in \u03b11 and \u03b12 . A loop's magnetic\ntwist is directly related to rotational photospheric motions:\n\u03c6 =\n\nLB\u03b8 (r)\n,\nrBz (r)\n\n0 \u2264 r \u2264 R3 .\n\n(20)\n\nThus, the photospheric motions directly determine a loop's \u03c6profile, which in turn determines \u03b1(r) (and hence, in our model,\n\u03b11 and \u03b12 ). The magnetic twist of coronal loops is an observable\nfeature (Kwon & Chae 2008). Portier-Fozzani et al. (2001) have\neven observed a loop's twist decreasing over time - evidence perhaps of a loop evolving towards a state of minimum energy.\n\n4\n\n3.1. Criteria for instability\n\n3\n\nMany workers have looked at the idea that the magnetic twist of\na loop can be used as a proxy for the onset of kink instability with\nsome critical twist parameter determining instability. Hood &\nPriest (1979) performed a MHD stability analysis on a variety of\nstraightened line-tied coronal loops. They showed that the critical twist, \u03c6crit , varies according to the aspect ratio (L/R2 ), plasma\nbeta (\u03b2) and the transverse magnetic structure (i.e., the nature of\nthe variable twist profile). In general, short fat loops (low aspect\nratio) have low critical twists, whereas long thin loops (high aspect ratio) have high critical twists. Subsequent work (Hood &\nPriest 1981) revealed that a loop of uniform twist, aspect ratio 10\nand zero \u03b2 possessed a critical twist of 2.49\u03c0. This figure is often\nquoted as a general result.\nThe question arises as to whether there is any single parameter (such as peak or average twist) which determines instability\nonset for all twist profiles. Indeed, more generally, it would be\ndesirable to have a single quantity determining instability onset\neven for more complex (non-cylinderical) fields (Malanushenko\net al. 2009). Incidental to our task, we have calculated the stability properties of an extensive family of equilibria, including\nfields with reversed twist (as well as simple monotonic-twist profiles as used by other authors). This provides a very useful test\nfor any proposed criteria for instability onset.\nLoops with variable-twist profiles have been previously studied; however, all such profiles generally have a similar form\n(Velli et al. 1990; Miki\u0107 et al. 1990; Baty 2001): the axial twist\nis the maximum, then the twist declines to a negligible value\nat the loop boundary. Velli et al. (1990) calculated that instability occurred when \u03c60 = \u03c6(r=0) = 2.5\u03c0; this agrees with Hood\nand Priest's result for a uniform twist profile. Miki\u0107 et al. (1990)\ncalculated a critical axial twist of 4.8\u03c0, the loop's average twist\nhowever, was \u223c2.5\u03c0.\nThe idea of using magnetic twist as a marker for instability relies on the existence of some twist-derived parameter having a constant value for all the points on the instability threshold. Baty (2001) used a MHD stability code to show that for\na small set of equilibria the average twist at instability is the\nsame for several different magnetic configurations. However,\nthere are several differences between Baty's work and the model\npresented here. Firstly, the twist profiles defined for each equilibrium are all positive and none contain multiple peaks (Fig.1,\nBaty 2001). Furthermore, critical twist convergence arises when\nthe normalised distance, d, is greater than 5 (Fig.5, Baty 2001).\n\n2\n1\n\u03b12\n\n5\n\n0\n-1\n-2\n-3\n-4\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\u03b11\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nFig. 3. The instability threshold encloses the relaxation line, which is\na subsection of the \u03b11 = \u03b12 line centred on the origin. The annotations\nillustrate the initial stages of a simulation that begins at the position\nmarked by the cross. The first random walk is shown in light grey; it\nends at the threshold position marked N and the associated relaxation\npoint is indicated by \u25b3, which is the starting point for a second random walk (dark grey). This walk attains instability onset at the position\nmarked \u0004 and relaxes to the point labelled \u0003 - the starting point for a\nthird walk.\n\nrelease events, which are collated to produce a nanoflare energy\ndistribution, see Sect. 4.2.\nWhen the loop relaxes, the \u03b1-profile throughout the loop and\nenvelope becomes constant, i.e., \u03b11 = \u03b12 = \u03b13 , 0. The envelope\nis no longer potential; it has acquired a residual current. In principle, as the main portion of the loop is twisted again by ongoing motions, a new equilibrium would develop with varying\ncurrent (\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) in the loop and a non-zero current (\u03b13 ) in the\nenvelope. For some threshold sections the consequent residual\ncurrent is so small that the threshold shape would remain unchanged. However, the validity of the simulation process can\nonly be assured by including an extra stage, wherein the envelope dissipates its helicity so that it becomes potential again. The\nloop can now resume its random walk with respect to the same\nthreshold.\nAlthough the primary purpose of this model is to calculate\nthe distribution of energy releases, in achieving this we also obtain some interesting new results on linear stability, which are\nsummarised in the next section. This is because, in order to explore the full parameter space of equilibrium current profiles, we\nhave calculated the linear stability properties of a much wider\nfamily of fields than previously investigated: in particular, fields\nwith reversed twists.\n\nd =\n\n\u03c60 R2\n.\nL\n\n(21)\n\n\f6\n\nM. R. Bareford et al.: The Energy Distribution of Nanoflares\n\nIn our equilibria, d = \u03c60 /20, the threshold values of the absolute\naxial magnetic twist vary from zero to 9\u03c0, which means d varies\nfrom 0 to 1.42, thus the average twists will not be in the regime\nwhere the critical axial twist converges to 2.5\u03c0. In fact, the large\nd regime cannot be attained.\nThe idea of a single critical average twist seems unlikely\nwhen one examines the threshold presented here. Clearly, at\nsome threshold points \u03b11 and \u03b12 are of opposite sign; thus, one\nor two places on the threshold will have an average twist equal to\nzero, and yet they are unstable. Perhaps critical twist is achieved\nwithin a subsection of the loop; this idea is explored further in\nSects. 3.2 and 3.3.\n\nif the core has the same twist orientation. To investigate these\nideas further, we plot the unstable eigenfunctions obtained from\nCILTS for the same \u03b1-space points, A to F.\n\n3.2. Radial twist profiles and linear eigenfunctions\n\nIn order to understand the nature of the instability, we investigate the twist profiles and eigenfunctions of the unstable mode,\nfor different parts of the instability threshold.

As one\nmoves from A to B, the twist in the core becomes more negative whilst the twist in the outer layer moves in the opposite\ndirection. It appears that the increase in \u03b12 stabilises the negative core twist by providing additional reversed (i.e., positive)\ntwist in the outer layer. The sharp corner at the top left of the\nthreshold marks the point where instabilities driven within the\ncore intersect those that originate from within the outer layer.\nProfiles C to D therefore, suggest instabilities driven in the outer\nlayer, since |\u03b12 | > |\u03b11 |. The peak twist in the outer layer reduces\nas the core twist moves from negative to positive. Further along\nthe threshold, where \u03b11 > \u03b12 , the instabilities are likely to be\ndriven in the core. Note that profiles D, E and F are always positive in sign; D has a twist peak near the loop edge while E and F\nare roughly monotonically decreasing. The corresponding magnetic field profiles for the six points A-F are given in Appendix\nB.\nIt seems that instabilities are driven mainly on or near the\npeak of largest absolute twist. A twisted field region may be stabilised by an enclosing region of opposite twist. Furthermore,\na twisted outer layer may need less twist to achieve instability\n\nfunctions for profiles C to D (Fig. 6) and the amplitude is highest near the R2 boundary, indicating an outer layer instability.\nFinally, the two plots in Fig. 7 (profiles E and F), clearly show\na progression towards the eigenfunction calculated for A (albeit\nwith a V x of opposite sign). Notice also that the form of the\n\nFig. 7.

This is to be expected,\nsince the \u03b1-space positions labelled B and C (Fig. 4, top left)\nare either side of the intersection point formed by the two curves\nthat describe the instability threshold.\n\n\fNext, we look for a twist-related parameter that takes on a critical value whenever the loop reaches the threshold. As expected,\nthe variation in axial twist, \u03c60 , is similar to the variation in \u03c6(R1 ),\nsee Fig. 8.

The tilde (\u223c) and hat\n(\u2227) symbols are used to indicate the other equations.\nWhen \u03b11 and \u03b12 are equal there is no distinction between the\nloop regions; this occurs on the threshold when \u03b11 = \u03b12 \u2248 1.4 - at\nthis point h\u03c6iR0 2 \u2248 5\u03c0. When \u03b12 = 0 and \u03b11 \u2248 2.2 the loop is identical to the core with a bigger potential envelope and h\u03c6iR0 1 \u2248 7.7\u03c0.\nThus, as expected, fatter loops like the first case, have lower instability twists than thinner ones. When the loop's core is potential (i.e., when \u03b11 = 0 and \u03b12 \u2248 2.2), h\u03c6iRR21 \u2248 4.5\u03c0 is the average\nouter layer twist. In this configuration, the loop is less stable than\nthe case when only the core is non-potential.\nNone of the twist averages (Fig. 9) is invariant along the entire threshold. Although, h\u03c6iR0 3 and h\u03c6\u0303iR0 3 have approximately the\nsame value (\u2248 2.2\u03c0) between threshold points 40 and 90. All\nof these points show a positive peak twist at R2 . Hence, the envelope's contribution dominates the overall average twist.

Again, the twist values are plotted\nin units of \u03c0.\n\nis especially true for the h\u03c6iR0 3 case: the higher the radial coordinate the greater the weight of the calculated twist. Within the\nenvelope, the twist declines as 1/r and so, the inclusion of the\nenvelope twist averages out the final result.\nNotice also, that all the twist averages go through zero when\nthe core and outer layer have opposite twists. It seems that these\nquantities do not reveal the detail necessary to understand why\na particular loop configuration is on the point of instability, nor\nwhere in the loop that instability originates.\nFinally, we consider the proposal of Malanushenko et al.\n(2009), that a critical value of normalised helicity (equivalent, in\nour terms, to the normalised loop helicity, K/\u03c82 , over the range\n0 - R2 ) indicates instability onset.

For fields with\nsingle-signed twist, the normalised helicity gives an approximate threshold, but even here, the (absolute) critical value ranges\nfrom about 1.5 - 2.5.

The bottom left panel confirms that each\nthreshold state corresponds to a relaxed state. The maximum \u03b1rx\nis about 0.48. Hence, there is a good chance that the envelope\ncurrent after relaxation will not be insignificant. This result confirms the need to investigate how this current could be dissipated\n(although the maximum value is still significantly less than typical \u03b11 and \u03b12 threshold values).\nThe energies shown in Fig. 11 (top right and bottom right)\nare given as dimensionless quantities, to calculate the dimensional energy we first give the dimensional flux though the loop\nand envelope,\nZ 3Rc\n2\u03c0rBz dr = 9\u03c0 R2c Bc ,\n(25)\n\u03c8=\n0\n\nwhere Rc is the coronal loop radius (the dimensionalised R2 ) and\nBc is the mean axial coronal field.

The relaxed state is the\nstart of a new random walk which will lead to another relaxation\n(and energy release). If this process is repeated often enough it\ncan be shown that certain energy release sizes are more common\nthan others.

Flare energy distributions for 100 (top left), 1000 (top right),\n104 (bottom left) and 105 (bottom right) relaxation events.\nThe gross features of the converged energy distribution can\nbe explained by presenting the energy distribution for the highest number of flare events (Fig. 12, bottom right) alongside the\ninstability threshold in Fig. 13. Both the distribution and the\nthreshold are colour-coded according to event energy. The colour\nof the threshold point encountered by a coronal loop indicates\nthe energy of the resulting flare and also the part of the distribution where the heating event falls. Dimensionalised values for\nthe flare energies have been recovered by using typical loop parameters (see above).\nThe energy release changes as one moves along the threshold, i.e., there is an energy release gradient. This gradient is\nsmall for low energies, therefore, only a few bins cover the low\nenergy sections of the threshold, see Fig. 13. The low energy release events are divided amongst a small number of bins, hence,\nthese bins contain many more events. The threshold sections corresponding to the profile minima are slightly longer than those\nassociated with the first peak (\u2248 1.5 times), however, the minima\nsections have a much higher energy release gradient. The energy\nrelease events are divided amongst a higher number of bins and\nso each of these bins contain fewer events. As one moves into\nthe threshold sections that correspond with the second profile\npeak (denoted by blue-green shades) the energy release gradient\ndecreases. Hence, one would expect the associated bins to have\nhigher event counts. This increase is accentuated however by the\n\n\fM. R. Bareford et al.: The Energy Distribution of Nanoflares\n\nproximity of the corresponding relaxation points. Once a loop\nachieves a blue-green instability, it will relax to a point (also\ncoloured blue-green), which happens to be closest to the green\nsection of the threshold. Subsequent walks will have a higher\nchance of crossing that section, thus, the corresponding distribution bins will contain even more events. The highest energy\nreleases available on the threshold are farthest away from the\nrelaxation line. In this part of the distribution, the chance of an\nenergy release event is inversely proportional to the size of the\nenergy release.\n\u03b4W*\n0.08\n\n0.08\n\nFlare Count (normalised)\n\n0.07\n0.06\n\n0.06\n0.05\n\n0.04\n\n0.04\n0.03\n\n0.02\n\n0.02\n0.01\n\n0\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\nFlare Energy (dimensionless)\n\n0.08\n\n4.2.1.

The trailing edge of the first peak\nequates to a power-law slope of \u2248 -1.5. Its internal structure cannot currently be resolved since one would need to increase the\nthreshold point density. The trailing edge of the second peak\ngives a slope of \u2248 -8.3; this is much greater than the critical gradient for nanoflare heating, m \u2264 \u22122 (Hudson 1991).\nThese power-law figures are provisional and are likely to\nchange as the model is enhanced. For example, a more realistic\n\u03b1-space traversal function - one where \u03b4\u03b12 is correlated with \u03b4\u03b11\n- will prefer walks parallel to the relaxation line; this will alter\nthe distribution of heating events. Furthermore, we consider here\nonly a single loop of fixed dimensions (or an ensemble of identical loops). In reality, in any given large-scale loop structure,\nsub-loops of varying radii will be generated, depending on the\nhorizontal scale-length of the driving photospheric motions. The\ndistribution must then be averaged over a distribution of radii, as\nwell as considering variations in length and field strength.\n\n0.02\n\n0.08\n\n0.08\nFlare Count (normalised)\n\n0.06\n\n0\n\n0\n\nof relaxations. The top left distribution of Fig. 14 is generated\nfrom a loop that is replaced after every 1000 relaxation events.\nAs the loop lifetime is reduced so is the height of the second\npeak. However, this peak reduction is only noticeable for small\nlifetimes, e.g., < 10 relaxations. A minimum lifetime of 1 relaxation (Fig. 14, bottom right) still yields a two-peaked distribution, albeit with a reduced second peak. This result corresponds\nto finding the energy release from an ensemble of identical loops.\nIt is also the most conservative in terms of total energy released.\nThe concept of a loop ensemble (a collection of 105 loops\nflaring simultaneously) is particularly useful, since it allows us\nto sidestep the complications that come with allowing loops to\nsurvive many relaxations. Otherwise, we would need to understand how a loop is affected by its energy release. A loop may\nshrink or implode after flaring (Janse & Low 2007). The instability threshold would be invalidated should the loop's aspect ratio\nbe altered as a consequence of post-flare shrinkage. Therefore,\nthe next section will examine in more detail the ensemble distribution.\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n\n9\n\nFig. 14.

We can simulate loop replacement by randomly selecting\na new position within the stability region after a certain number\n\nThe primary aim of our model is to calculate the distribution\nof nanoflares. In general terms, the heating rate will be similar\nto other calculations in the literature based on random photospheric twisting (Abramenko et al. 2006; Zirker & Cleveland\n1993; Berger 1991; Sturrock & Uchida 1981). Within our approach, all the energy input from the photosphere must be dissipated, in a long-term time-average over many events, since the\nbuild up of coronal magnetic field is limited by the instability\nthreshold.\nThe energy flux, F, can be expressed using Eqn. 27;\nF =\n\n81\u03c02 1\n1\n81\u03c0 Rc B2c h\u03b4W \u2217 i\nR3c B2c h\u03b4W \u2217 i =\n, (28)\n2\n\u03bc0 N\u03c4 2\u03c0Rc\n2\u03bc0 \u03c4\nN\n\nwhere N is the average number of steps taken to reach the threshold, \u03c4 is the time taken to complete each step in the random walk\nand h\u03b4W \u2217 i is the average dimensionless energy release, given by\nh\u03b4W \u2217 i =\n\n105\n1 X\n\u03b4W \u2217 .\n105 i=1\n\n(29)\n\n\fM.

Random walk step size\n\nSo far, we have assumed photospheric motions to be somewhat\ntemporally incoherent, with a short random walk step, \u03b4\u03b1 = 0.1,\ncorresponding to \u03c4 = 200 s. Here, we consider the effect of varying this step length; in other words, varying the coherence time\nof the photospheric motions. Fig. 15, which should be compared\nwith the bottom right panel of Fig. 14, shows the distributions\nthat result when \u03b4\u03b1 is increased by factors of 10 and 40. For\nthe latter case, the step is sufficiently long that, on average, just\none step is required to reach the instability threshold: this corresponds to a temporally coherent twisting of the loop (although\nthe spatial profile of the twisting varies randomly between heating events).\n0.08\nFlare Count (normalised)\n\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n0\n\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\nFlare Energy (dimensionless)\n\n0.08\n\n0\n\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\nFlare Energy (dimensionless)\n\nsize of \u03b4\u03b1 = 1 (left) and \u03b4\u03b1 = 4 (right).

Consequently, the\nrelaxation line is closer to the part of the threshold associated\nwith the highest energies; this explains why the distribution has\na thicker tail. The energy flux is F \u2248 4 \u00d7 106 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , which\nincreases with step size in the same manner as shown for the\n\u03b1-space simulations.\n4.3. Temporal properties\n\nWe can gain some insight into the temporal distribution of heating events by assuming that each step of a random walk in \u03b1space takes the same arbitrary unit of time, corresponding to\nphotospheric driving. The time axes of Fig. 17 are shown in\nterms of random walk step number (i.e., step count or running\nstep count).

However, the heating flux\ndoes depend on this quantity. It is expected that the heating flux\nshould be proportional to \u03c4 (Berger 1991; Zirker & Cleveland\n1993). Eqn. 28 shows this to be the case, since the average number of steps, N, for the random walk to reach the threshold scales\nas N \u221d \u03c4\u22122 . In particular, if we consider the limiting case of coherent twisting (\u03c4 = 8000 s, N \u2248 1.13 and h\u03b4W \u2217 i \u2248 0.0305) we\nfind that the flux increases significantly, F \u2248 3 \u00d7 107 erg cm\u22122\ns\u22121 for Active Regions.\n\n0.06\n\nFig. 16.

We use\n\u03c6(R1 ) and \u03c6(R2 ) to obtain a 2-parameter representation of the\nfamily \u03c6(r), since the twist profiles of Fig. 4 usually show peak\ntwists at the radial boundaries R1 (0.5) and R2 (1.0). The instability threshold can thus be plotted in twist space rather than alpha\nspace, as in Fig. 3. Given that the process is driven by turbulent photospheric motions, it is more realistic to consider that\nthe twist randomly evolves, rather than the \u03b1 profile.

The\nsize of the flares are shown in a way that is reminiscent of actual\nflare/microflare/nanoflare observations: the bigger the event, the wider\nthe base of the triangle used to represent that flare. The figure covers a\ntime sequence equal to 5000 steps, taken from a random position within\nthe simulation data.\n\nThe probability that a flare event will have occurred after\na particular number of steps in \u03b1-space is invariant with time,\nsee Fig. 17 (top left). This is also true for the probability that a\n\n\fM. R. Bareford et al.: The Energy Distribution of Nanoflares\n1\nMagnetic Shear [0-R2]\n\nflare event will have a particular energy: the flare energy is not\ndependent on where in the simulation it occurs. The two horizontal bands shown in the bottom left panel are consistent with\nthe peaks shown in Figs. 14-15.\nThere does appear to be a slight relationship between the\nflare interval time (i.e., the number of steps taken to reach the\nthreshold) and the flare energy, see Fig. 17 (top right); but, no\npositive correlation is evident. Observations strongly suggest\nthat these two properties are uncorrelated (Wheatland 2000).\nThe top right panel echoes the shape of the energy release distributions. The instability threshold has an energy release gradient,\nwhich means that sections of threshold that have a more or less\nconstant energy release (low gradient) will be visited by more\nloops. The higher the number of visiting loops, the wider the\nrange of step counts associated with that section of the threshold. Thus, Fig. 17 (top right) is in agreement with observations.\nFinally, the simulated energy releases can also be represented\nas a time series of flare energies, again see Fig. 17 (bottom left).\n\n11\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n60\n80\nThreshold Point\n\n100\n\n120\n\nFig. 18.

Critical magnetic shear and coronal heating\nrequirements\n\nParker (1988) explains that a magnetic flux bundle rooted in\nthe photosphere (i.e., a coronal loop) will be stressed as photospheric motions move the footpoints in a direction transverse\nto the original magnetic field. The coronal heating requirements\nfor Active Regions and for the Quiet Sun can be converted to\nequivalent magnetic stresses, which can in turn be converted to\nmagnetic shears (B\u22a5 /Bz );\nB\u22a5\n4\u03c0F\n\u2248 2 ,\nBz\nB z v\u03b8\n\n(30)\n\nwhere B\u22a5 is the transverse field, Bz is the original axial field, F is\nthe coronal heating requirement and v\u03b8 is the photospheric flow\nvelocity. We set v\u03b8 = 1 km s\u22121 for consistency and find that the\nnecessary magnetic shear is approximately 0.12 (\u223c7\u25e6 ) for Active\nRegions and 0.38 (\u223c21\u25e6 ) for the Quiet Sun.\nThus, for coronal heating to work, there must be some mechanism which restricts the shear to around these levels. If dissipation occurs at lower levels of shear the energy flux cannot\nmaintain coronal temperatures. Conversely, if the shear can build\nup to much larger levels, the energy input would be higher than\nrequired. Our model provides an explanation for these critical\nshear values. We calculate two types of mean magnetic shear\nalong the threshold, the mean absolute shear and the root mean\nsquare shear:\nZ R2\n2\nB\u03b8\nS MABS = 2\nr\ndr ,\n(31)\nBz\nR2 0\nv\nt Z\n!2\nR2\n2\nB\u03b8\ndr .\n(32)\nr\nS RMS =\nBz\nR22 0\nBoth quantities are area-averaged. The plot (Fig. 18) shows that\nthe values of S MABS and SRMS are comparable with those derived above. In general, we find that the average shear at the\nthreshold is slightly higher than the limit suggested by Parker.\nPerhaps more shear is required, since not all of the magnetic energy released during relaxation will be converted to heat. Fig. 18\nsuggests that the apparent limiting value for magnetic shear is\ndetermined by the linear instability.\nWe should mention the work of Dahlburg et al. (2009), who\nprovide an alternative explanation of this shear dependency involving an explosive \"secondary instability\". They have used a\n\nWe have used a model based on relaxation theory to determine\nthe energy release of a sequence of heating events generated\nby random photospheric footpoint motions. This is a \"stressrelax\" scenario, in which free energy is continually built-up in\nthe corona due to photospheric driving - repeated relaxations occur whenever a critical condition is reached. We postulate that\nheating events are triggered by the onset of an ideal kink instability. Energy release then occurs by fast magnetic reconnection\nin current sheets generated during the nonlinear phase of the instability, and this is calculated by assuming a helicity-conserving\nrelaxation to a minimum energy state. The energy release of any\nindividual heating event depends on the current profile at the\npoint where the instability threshold is crossed - thus heating\nevents of a range of sizes are found.\nThe initial stressed fields are modelled using piecewiseconstant profiles of \u03b1, yielding a two-parameter family of current profiles. Photospheric driving thus yields a random walk of\nthe current profile. In order to pursue the calculation, the ideal\ninstability threshold of a line-tied loop has been determined.\nThe modelled current profiles incorporate regions of positive and\nnegative twist as well as monotonic twist profiles, as have been\nmore commonly studied. We have shown that it is not possible\nto determine the onset of instability by any simple criterion such\nas achieving a critical twist or critical helicity. Nevertheless, Fig.\n4 suggests that the location of the instability is coincident with\nthe peak twist (the largest absolute twist).\nA distribution of heating events has been calculated, both\nfor the case of a single loop which undergoes repeated stressing\nand relaxation, and for an ensemble of identical loops which are\nrandomly stressed (and for intermediate cases). For a sufficiently\nlarge number of events, a statistically-stable distribution of event\nsizes is obtained. As expected, the smallest events are the most\ncommon, and there is (as noted by Browning & Van der Linden\n2003) a minimum event size for given loop parameters, perhaps\ncorresponding to an \"elemental nanoflare\". More surprisingly,\nthere is a second peak of event frequency at intermediate magnitudes, although this is somewhat reduced in size if an ensemble\nof loops is considered. This can be explained as follows. The\nfirst peak (at minimum energy) occurs simply because the range\nof energies near the minimum naturally encompasses the largest\npart of the instability threshold curve (because of the flatness of\nthe minimum). The second peak is found because the instability threshold is most likely to be crossed in the part near to the\nregion of constant-\u03b1.\n\n\f12\n\nM. R. Bareford et al.: The Energy Distribution of Nanoflares\n\nAn ensemble of identical loops - in which each individual\nloop starts from a randomly chosen initial state and is stressed\nuntil it undergoes a single relaxation event - is investigated in\nmore detail. The distribution of heating events is qualitatively\nsimilar, although, the secondary peak of event frequency is much\nlower, and the decay of frequency with increasing energy is\nmuch flatter. A significant result is that, although the distribution\nis not a simple power law, the high-energy part of the distribution\nis well approximated by a power law with an index of around 8.3, which is considerably steeper than the minimum required\nfor nanoflare heating to be effective (-2).\nThe model requires that the field is sometimes unstable - although most of the time, the field profile will be well within the\nstable region. Typically, the dimensional \u03b1 value is of magnitude 1 - 2, leading to dimensional values of \u03b1 \u2248 1 - 2 Mm\u22121 (for\na loop radius of 1 Mm). Note that this is the maximum value\nwhich could be found, and usually we would expect lower values. This is consistent with observations; for example R\u00e9gnier &\nPriest (2007) find \u03b1 magnitudes around 1 Mm\u22121 . Furthermore,\na consequence of the fact that the fields are predicted to fluctuate between stable and unstable states is that we predict a\nvalue for the average horizontal field component (on average,\nthis will be somewhat less than the value at marginal stability).\nAt threshold, we find B\u22a5 /Bz is around 0.5, which means that its\naverage value should be around 0.25. This agrees very well with\nthe limit on this quantity required by Parker (1988), in order for\nthe Poynting flux from the photosphere to match coronal heating requirements. Hence, we have an explanation for the critical\nshear value predicted by Parker. This also implies that the average heating flux from our model will be sufficient for coronal\nheating. Indeed, the fluxes derived from our results agree (especially if we raise the correlation time for photospheric motions)\nwith the required values.\nRelaxation theory makes no prediction about the spatial distribution of energy dissipation. However, this can be determined\nfrom numerical simulations. Recently, Hood et al. (2009) have\nshown that heating is well-distributed across the loop volume, as\nthe current sheet, associated with the nonlinear kink instability,\nstretches and fragments, thereby filling the loop cross section.\nThis has implications for the observed emission.\nA further important consideration is that we study a single\nloop of fixed dimensions, with repeated stressing and relaxation.\nIn practice, coronal heating events will occur in regions of field\nof varying sizes. A large flare will inevitably involve a large magnetic field volume, whereas nanoflares may involve small sets of\nfieldlines. This could be accounted for in our model by allowing\nthe loop radius to be randomly distributed also; the effect would\nbe to convolve a set of our energy distributions. A second limitation of the calculation is that we have assumed a uniform random\nwalk in \u03b1 space. This is not realistic, since photospheric twisting\nmotions are likely to be correlated across the loop cross section\nand therefore changes in which the twist in the outer later is similar to that in the core are much more likely: in other words, there\nshould be a positive correlation between changes in \u03b11 (the core\ncurrent) and changes in \u03b12 (the current in the outer layer), rather\nthan these being independent random variables as assumed here.\nThis will be considered further in future work.\nAs well as the improvements mentioned above, the model\nwill be enhanced such that there is, more realistically, zero netcurrent carried by the loop. At present, in most cases the potential layer outside the loop contains azimuthal field. A current\nneutralisation layer will be inserted between the loop and the envelope - external magnetic fields will have an axial direction only\n\n(Hood et al. 2009), representing a response to localised photospheric twist motions.\nThe model has included a number of simplifications, and\nat this stage is more of a \"proof of principle\" showing that\na distribution of heating events can be produced from an\n(almost) ab initio coronal heating model. These initial results\ndemonstrate the viability of the model for further research.\nAcknowledgements. We are grateful to Jim Klimchuk for helpful\ncomments and M. R.
