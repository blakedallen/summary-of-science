If the sample exhibits current-dependent shot\nnoise, the down-converted noise power spectrum varies depending on the local-oscillator phase of\nthe mixer. The theory of this phase-dependent noise is applied to discuss the measurement of the\nradio-frequency single-electron transistor. We also show that this effect can be used to measure the\nshot noise accurately even in nonlinear high-impedance samples.\nPACS numbers: 05.40.Ca\n\nThe dominating noise mechanism in mesoscopic samples at low temperatures is shot noise. In some cases, it\nis the limiting factor for the measurement sensitivity, but\nit may be the measured quantity itself as it, contrary to\nthe thermal noise, contains information about the sample\ncomplement to that of the average current [1]. Many of\nthe interesting predictions for noise have been obtained\nfor nonlinear elements (with voltage-dependent response)\nwhose resistance is typically in the range of k\u03a9 or more.\nHowever, measurement of shot noise in such samples is\nnot always straightforward as the excess noise added by\nthe amplifiers depends on the sample impedance, and\nthus on the applied voltage. An important property of\nshot noise is that it is typically proportional to the average current. In this paper we exploit this property and\nshow that with adiabatic cyclostationary driving, generalizing the treatment in Refs. [2, 3], one may modulate\nthe noise by using a few first harmonics of the base frequency. We show that this can be used to improve the\nsensitivity of the radio-frequency single electron transistor (RF-SET) by some fraction. We also show that the\nuse of the phase dependence of the noise allows the noise\nto be measured without a precise knowledge of the amplifier noise.\nThroughout the paper we consider a situation illustrated in Fig. . We limit to the case where current\ni(t) = I0 + I1 sin(\u03c90 t) + I2 cos(2\u03c90 t) + n(t) flows through\nthe sample. We assume that hi(t)i = I0 + I1 sin(\u03c90 t) +\nI2 cos(2\u03c90 t) \u2261 I(t) and noise hn(t)i = 0. For a low\nenough driving frequency \u03c90 , shot noise adiabatically follows the absolute value of the current. Moreover, in this\nlow-frequency limit, the noise is white.

It is assumed that T =\n2N \u03c0/\u03c90 , where N \u226b 1 is an integer. Equation (2) is\nderived for a diode (F = 1) in the case I(t) > 0 in Refs.\n[2, 3] and the generalization to the case with arbitrary\nsign of I(t) is straightforward.\n\ni(t)\n\nsample\n\ny(t)\n\nD(t)\n\nZ\n\nFIG. 1: The general setup. Current i(t) flows through the\nsample. Output current is y(t) = i(t) \u00d7 D(t), where D(t) =\nD0 sin(\u03c90 t + \u03c6). It is converted into a signal voltage using\ndetection circuitry.\n\nThe goal is to find the power spectral density Sy (\u03c9) \u2261\n2\ni\nlimT \u2192\u221e 2 h|y(\u03c9)|\nfor y(t) = D(t) \u00d7 i(t), where D(t) =\nT\nD0 sin(\u03c90 t + \u03c6).

The first term in\n(4) is usually taken as the downconverted carrier for\nthe signal and the other terms as noise. It is to be\nnoted that only the DC and 2\u03c90 components of I \u0303A (\u03c9)\ncontribute to the noise. It is thus enough for the\nnoise calculations to find the Fourier series expansion\n|I(t)| \u2243 I0A + I1A sin(\u03c90 t + \u03b8A ) + I2A cos(2\u03c90 t), where\nI1A and \u03b8A have no effect on the noise.

[2, 3] except that we\nhave defined it in terms of Fourier expansion coefficients\nI0A and I2A in order to handle alternating currents.\nWe first apply Eq.(5) to the analysis of the RF-SET,\nthat is the most sensitive electrometer known today [4, 5].\nIn practice, its sensitivity is limited by the noise of the\nfollowing amplifier [6]. In the near future when this noise\nwill probably be reduced from a few Kelvin to \u223c100 mK\n[7] the charge sensitivity will be set by the shot noise\nof the tunnelling electrons through the single-electron\ntransistor (SET) [8]. A metallic RF-SET is operated in\ntwo different modes: In the superconducting case the\nbest sensitivity is achieved with DC bias. In the normal (non-superconducting) case the best sensitivity is\nobtained without the DC bias. In this latter case, the\ncurrent I(t) through the SET is given by I1 sin(\u03c90 t) and\nwe find |I(t)| \u2243 I0A + I2A cos(2\u03c9t), where I0A = I1 2/\u03c0\nand I2A = \u22124I1 /(3\u03c0). The operation of the RF-SET\nis based on amplitude modulation, because the signal is\ndue to the resistance variation in time. This means that\nthe largest signal component comes out when \u03c6 = 0 and\nthe shot noise Sy is at maximum according to Eq. (5).\nIn contrast, if the RF-SET could be operated in a phase\nvariation mode such that the signal component would be\nin the cos(\u03c90 t) quadrature (\u03c6 = \u03c0/2), then the shot noise\ncontribution would be by a factor of two lower in power.\nIn the other measurement mode, the SET is DC biased and the current through it may be approximated by\nI(t) = |I(t)| = I0 +I1 sin(\u03c90 t) = I0A +I1A sin(\u03c90 t). From\nEq. (5) it follows that the noise is set by the I0 component alone. Adding a component I2 cos(2\u03c90 t) to the current, the measured noise power spectrum may be lowered\nby some fraction. If the signal component is negligibly\naffected by the 2\u03c90 - component, the signal-to-noise ratio\nwould also be enhanced.\nIn some cases, noise reveals additional information\nthat cannot be extracted from IV curve measurements.\nFor example, in the subgap regime of normal-insulatorsuperconductor contact, shot noise could be used as a\n\nCurrent\n\nh\u1ef9(\u03c9)\u1ef9 \u2217 (\u03c9)i =\n\n(4)\n\nB\n\nA\n\nVoltage\nFIG. 2: An arbitrary nonlinear IV curve illustrating the problem of the noise measurements. Regions A and B have different impedances and the amplifier noise contribution to the\ntotal noise is different at these points. In 2\u03c90 modulation,\nthe sample is DC biased (marked by circles) and a signal\nI2 cos(2\u03c90 t) is added (marked as gray area). By measuring\nthe noise in both quadratures by varying mixer phase \u03c6, one\nmay extract the shot noise contribution to the total noise.\n\ntool to determine whether conduction is due to quasiparticles (thermal excitation or leakage current) or due\nto Andreev reflection. However, noise measurements at\nlow frequencies of such nonlinear high-resistance samples\nwith conventional techniques are possible only with special care [9] provided that 1/f -noise is negligible. Alternatively, measurements have been carried out on very\nlarge samples in order to circumvent the problems [10].\nA characteristic illustration is depicted in Fig. : IV curve\nis measured, but noise contribution of the sample cannot be extracted from the total measured noise. This is\ndue to the dominating amplifier noise variation, that is\ndifficult to know accurately, with respect to the sample\nimpedance. In general, measurement of the shot noise in\nmesoscopic samples with high impedance levels (> 1 k\u03a9)\nis difficult due to the small signal levels.\nIn the following we propose a technique to use 2\u03c90\nmodulation in order to measure the shot noise. By\n2\u03c90 modulation technique we mean a setup, where local oscillator signal in the mixer is of the form D(t) =\nD0 sin(\u03c90 t + \u03c6) and there is a term I2A cos(2\u03c90 t) in the\nabsolute value |I(t)| of the current through the sample.\nIn order to avoid the 1/f noise, we discuss noise measurements at high frequencies, that is f \u223c 500 MHz. In\nthis frequency range the signal is carried in coaxial cables. The restricted cable size limits the characteristic\nimpedance to values around Z0 \u223c 50 \u03a9.\nTo be specific, we approach the problem by considering an example. If the shot noise is to be measured from\na current of 100 pA assuming a Fano-factor F of unity,\n\n\f3\nthe resulting noise corresponds to a delivered power of\nTS \u223c 2eIZ0 to the preamplifier. This equals 100 \u03bcK in\nnoise temperature. By using the Dicke radiometer formula [11] for the fractional\n\u221a error of the noise measurement \u2206T /(TN + TS ) \u223c 1/ B\u03c4 , where \u03c4 is the measurement time and B the measurement bandwidth, it follows\nthat with \u03c4 \u223c 1 s and B \u223c 108 Hz the signal power of 100\n\u03bcK may be measured if the amplifier noise temperature\nTN is of the order of 1 K. The practical problem is that\nTN depends in general considerably on the impedance\nof the measured source [6, 12]. In order to extract the\nshot noise contribution from the total measured noise, it\nwould be necessary to know the four noise parameters of\nthe amplifier [12, 13] and their effect to the measured\ntotal noise with an accuracy of 100 ppm. This is almost\nimpossible in practice. One solution is to use a series of\ncryogenic isolators that have typically an isolation of 20\ndB each. There is, however, the problem that below 1\nGHz isolators are bulky to fit into the limited space of\nmK-cryostats.\nThe 2\u03c90 modulation technique can be used to partially\ncircumvent the problem considered above. As is obvious\nfrom Eq. (5), a change of the mixer local oscillator phase\n\u03c6 varies the measured shot noise power by an amount\n\u223c F eI2A Z0 from the maximum to the minimum. This\nis an analogue of the lock-in scheme frequently applied\nfor the measurement of the differential conductance. The\npoint is that the (phase-insensitive) amplifier noise does\nnot directly depend on \u03c6, but only through the possible\nbias dependence of the sample impedance (which would\nmake the amplifier noise contribution partially follow the\ndriving). The latter effect can be reduced in the typically\ninteresting limit where the sample impedance exceeds the\namplifier impedance, through the use of a matching circuit whose characteristic impedance equals that of the\namplifier. In this case, provided the sample impedance\ndoes not depend on the bias more strongly than the noise,\n\nthe modulation of the sample noise may be brought to\ndominate the environmental contribution to the phasesensitive noise. The advantage compared to the direct\nmeasurement is that the contribution from the environment in this case depends only on the nonlinearity of the\nsample, whereas in the unmodulated measurement it is\npresent even for linear samples. In order to compare the\nresults of the noise measurement at different bias points,\none needs to know the impedance of the sample at these\npoints. This may be found out by measuring the reflecZ\u2212Z0\ntion coefficient \u0393 = Z+Z\nof the sample, where Z is the\n0\nsample impedance and Z0 the reflected wave impedance.\nIn general, the total gain of the system is not known\naccurately and it often varies on a time-scale of hours.\nTherefore, the measurement produces a differential result dSy /dI2A = GF (I0A ) of the possibly bias-dependent\nFano factor F (I0A ) with one unknown multiplicative gain\nfactor G. If there is, however, one measured point that\nhas a well established result, for example F = 1 as is\nthe case in typical tunnelling structures at high voltages,\nthe measurement result at this point can be used as a\ncalibration to extract gain G, and the Fano factor can be\nfound out over the whole measurement range.\nAs a conclusion, we have discussed the theory of a\ndoubly modulated shot noise. We applied the outcome,\nEq. (5), to the zero DC bias RF-SET and concluded that\nthere is by a factor two more noise in the in-phase quadrature than in the out-of-phase quadrature. We suggested\nthe use of the 2\u03c90 modulation in order to reduce shot\nnoise by some fraction in the case of the DC biased RFSET. We also argued that the 2\u03c90 modulation may be\nused to extract the shot noise contribution from the total\nnoise. This may be applied, e.g., to determine Fano factors from high-impedance samples at current levels below\n1 nA using an amplifier with noise temperature TN \u223c 1\nK, a measurement bandwidth of 108 Hz, and a measurement time of 1 s.\n\n[1] Y.
