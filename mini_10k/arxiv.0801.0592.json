In studies with periodic boundary conditions, the Drude weight, i.e., the weight of the zero frequency delta peak, is found to be nonzero for\nintegrable systems, even at very high temperatures, whereas it vanishes for generic (nonintegrable)\nsystems. Paradoxically, for systems with open boundary conditions, it can be shown that the coefficient of the zero frequency delta peak is identically zero for any finite system, regardless of its\nintegrability. In order for the Drude weight to be a thermodynamically meaningful quantity, both\nkinds of boundary conditions should produce the same answer in the thermodynamic limit. We\nshed light on these issues by using analytical and numerical methods.\nPACS numbers: 05.60.Gg,72.10.Bg\n\nTransport properties define materials as superconductors, metals, or insulators.1,2,3 In one dimension, transport can help differentiate integrable from nonintegrable\nsystems. Integrable systems, in general, display an infinite conductivity at all temperatures,4 an effect that has\nbeen related to the strong influence of conservation laws,\nwhile at high temperatures, generic (nonintegrable) systems are expected to exhibit a finite resistivity caused by\numklapp scattering and inelastic collisions.\nLet us consider a finite system of length L (in units of\nthe lattice constant); the real part of the conductivity10\ncan be written as2,4,5\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c0 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b2~\u03c9\nRe [\u03c3L (\u03c9)] = \u03c0DL \u03b4(~\u03c9) +\nL\n\u03c9\nX\n2\npn |Jnm | \u03b4(\u01ebm \u2212 \u01ebn \u2212 ~\u03c9), (1)\n\u00d7\n\u01ebn 6=\u01ebm\n\nwhere\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\nX pn \u2212 pm\n1\uf8f0\nDL =\nh\u0393\u0302i \u2212 ~\n|Jnm |2 \uf8fb ,\nL\n\u01ebm \u2212 \u01ebn\n\n(2)\n\n\u01ebn 6=\u01ebm\n\nis the Drude weight (or charge stiffness), the stress tensor\n\u02c6\nn\u0302(\u2212k)], J\u02c6 is the current\noperator \u0393\u0302 = \u2212qe limk\u21920 k1 [J(k),\n\u02c6\noperator, Jnm = hn|J|mi\nare its matrix elements, n\u0302(k) is\nthe Fourier transform of the local density operator n\u0302j , qe\nthe charge, and \u0393 = h\u0393\u0302i/~L. The Boltzmann weight of\na state |mi is denoted by pm = e\u2212\u03b2\u01ebm /Z, with \u01ebm being\nits energy, \u03b2 = 1/kB T , and Z the partition function.\nIn one dimension, and finite temperatures, the Drude\nweight can also be computed as,4,5 (assuming that there\nis no true superconductivity)\n\u03b2~ X\n\u2217\nDL\n=\npn |Jnm |2 .\nL \u01eb =\u01eb\nn\n\n(3)\n\n\u2217\ninfinite volume object D\u221e = limL\u2192\u221e DL = limL\u2192\u221e DL\n,\nand \u03c3reg is the \"regular\" part of the conductivity. In systems with periodic boundary conditions (pbc's), DL and\n\u2217\nDL\nare found to be nonzero in integrable systems at all\ntemperatures, i.e., they display an infinite conductivity,\n\u2217\nwhereas DL and DL\nare expected to exponentially vanish\nwith the system size for nonintegrable systems.4,6\nA very different situation arises when one studies systems with open boundary conditions (obc's). There,\n5\none\nP can legitimately define the position operator X\u0302 =\nj j n\u0302j , which satisfies the following commutation relations: J\u02c6 = i[X\u0302, \u0124], where \u0124 is the Hamiltonian of\n\u02c6 Since Jnm = i(\u01ebm \u2212\nthe system and \u0393\u0302 = \u2212i[X\u0302, J].\n\u2217\n\u01ebn )hn|X\u0302|mi, one can see that DL\n(3) is identically zero,\nand that the first and second terms in the right hand side\nof Eq. (2) cancel each other, so that DL is also identically\n\u2217\nzero. The vanishing of DL and DL\nfor systems with obc's\nis true regardless of their integrability.11\nConsidering the results above, one could question\nwhether the Drude weight is a meaningful thermodynamic quantity, i.e., whether one would obtain the same\nresult, measuring it in (quasi-) one-dimensional (1D) experiments involving closed rings or open chains. This\nis a valid concern since D\u221e is not a usual bulk thermodynamic quantity. (For the latter, the equivalence of\nboundary conditions in the TL is obvious.) In an expansion of the energy of the system in powers of L, D\u221e at\nT = 0 is proportional to a term that scales like 1/L.1,2\nOur goal in this work is to shed light on this puzzle.\nWe consider 1D systems of spinless fermions,\nX\nX \u2020\nn\u0302j n\u0302j+1\n\u0109j \u0109j+1 + h.c. + V\n\u0124 = \u2212t\nj\n\nj\n\n\u2212t\n\n\u2032\n\nX\nj\n\n\u0109\u2020j \u0109j+2\n\n+ h.c. + V\n\n\u2032\n\nX\n\nn\u0302j n\u0302j+2\n\n(4)\n\nj\n\nm\n\nEquation (1) is true for all boundary conditions.

This expression shows that the matrix\nelements of J\u02c6 have a very interesting property: although\n|Jnm | vanish for m = n, they attain their largest values\nfor the smallest (odd) differences between m and n. For\nvery large systems, the factor 1/L2 produces vanishing\nvalues of Jnm unless n \u223c m. Rewriting kn = km \u00b1\n\u03c0l/(L + 1), l = 1, 3, . . . one can see that Re [\u03c3(\u03c9)] is a\nsum of delta functions \u03b4[\u03c9 \u00b1 2\u03c0t sin(km )l/(L + 1)] whose\nweight decreases as \u223c 1/l2 .\nIn Fig. 1(a), we show Re [\u03c3(\u03c9)] (binned to obtain a\nsmooth curve) for noninteracting particles in two systems with obc's and different sizes. This figure shows\nthat (i) broadened delta functions collapse to larger peaks\n(whose width reduces as the system size increases) situated at \u03c9 \u223c 2\u03c0l/L with l = 1, 3, . . ., and (ii) these peaks\nmove toward smaller frequencies as L increases. From\nthe previous analysis, one can conclude that although\n\u2217\nfor finite open systems DL and DL\nare always zero, for\nL \u2192 \u221e, a delta peak develops at \u03c9 = 0, but this time\ngenerated by the collapse of delta peaks that come from\nthe so-called regular partR of the conductivity.

In this case, |Jnm |2 = [2qe t sin(km )]2 \u03b4m,n ,\ni.e., the matrix elements of J\u02c6 are fully diagonal, and\nDL = h\u0393\u0302i/~L = qe2 h\u0124i/~L.

(It\ncan be mapped onto the XXZ spin 1/2 chain.) To understand the effects of obc's in more generic nonintegrable\nsystems, we study systems with finite values of t\u2032 and V \u2032 .\nThe current and stress tensor operators for this model\ncan be written as\n2iqe t\u2032 X \u2020\niqe t X \u2020\n\u0109j \u0109j+1 + H.c. +\n\u0109j \u0109j+2 + H.c.,\nJ\u02c6 =\n~\n~\n\n1.2\n\n0.4\n\nL=16 (pbc's)\nL=18 (pbc's)\nL=16 (obc's)\nL=17 (obc's)\n\nV=2.0\n\n0.8\n0.2\n\n0.4\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\u03c9\n\n3\n\n4\n\nFIG. 1: (color online).

All of these results were obtained at a very\nhigh temperature \u03b2 = 0.001 (infinite in the noninteracting\ncase) and half-filling. The inset in (a) shows how \u2206 (see text)\nbehaves as one approaches the TL. The values of V , \u03b2, and\n\u03c9 are given in units of t.\n\none obtains that the weight of such \u03c9 = 0 peak is\n\u03c0D\u221e = limL\u2192\u221e \u03c0h\u0393\u0302i/~L = limL\u2192\u221e \u03c0qe2 h\u0124i/~L, which\nis identical to \u03c0D\u221e as obtained from periodic systems\nsince the energy is identical in both cases.\nAt this point, one may wonder about the behavior of\nthe finite frequency (\u03c9 \u223c \u00b12\u03c0l/L, l = 1, 3, . . .) peaks as\nL is increased. It may happen that as L \u2192 \u221e, (i) all the\nweight is concentrated in the lowest \u03c9 = \u00b11/L peaks,\nand the others disappear, or (ii) the weight is distributed\namong several peaks with different values of \u03c9. To answer\nthis question, we have studied the summed weight of the\npeaks at \u03c9 \u223c \u00b12\u03c0/L as a function of increasing system\nsize, a quantity we call \u2206. Results are shown in the inset\nin Fig. 1(a). They confirm the scenario (ii) above since,\nas L \u2192 \u221e, \u2206 saturates at around 80% of \u03c0\u0393. Hence,\nthe other peaks with l > 1 remain finite, and they are\nneeded to account for the exact Drude weight in the TL.\nMoving away from the noninteracting case, but keeping\nthe system integrable, we cannot make the corresponding\nanalytical treatment, so we turn to a full exact diagonalization of finite chains. We perform calculations in the\ngrand-canonical ensemble, and all results presented in\nwhat follows are obtained at half-filling (n = 0.5).\nFor generic integrable systems with pbc's, the matrix\nelements of J\u02c6 are not diagonal anymore like in the noninteracting case.

(b) The Drude weight, computed as DL and DL\n,\nand \u0393 as a function of \u03b2 for the isotropic case (V = 2.0).\n\nbecomes finite. This can be seen in Fig. 1(b) and its inset, where we have plotted Re [\u03c3(\u03c9)] for two integrable\nsystems with different values of V . The scaling of the\nDrude weight with system size, together with a \"simple\nminded\" linear extrapolation to the TL, are shown in\nFig. 2(a). As seen there, for both V = 1.0 and V = 2.0,\nwe obtain a finite value of D\u221e .2,4,6,7\nThe results presented so far were obtained at a very\nhigh temperature (\u03b2 = 0.001), where finite size effects are\nthe smallest, but transport properties are still nontrivial.\nIn Fig. 2(b), one can see that for T > 10, the actual\nvalue of T is not essential since quantities such as DL T ,\n\u2217\nDL\nT , and \u0393T become almost independent of T . Figure\n2(b) also shows that, for the considered temperatures and\nsystem sizes, \u0393 is independent of the system size, while\n\u2217\nDL and DL\nstill exhibit finite size effects. It is important\n\u2217\nto notice that albeit DL and DL\nare identical for any\ngiven system size at high temperatures, finite size effects\nbuild differences between these two ways of computing\nthe Drude weight at lower temperatures.6\nAfter reviewing the pbc case, we can now analyze the\neffects of obc's on more generic integrable systems. In\nFig. 1(b) and its inset, we have plotted Re [\u03c3(\u03c9)] for\nchains with obc's, and two different values of V , together\nwith the results for pbc's. One can clearly see there that\nlarge peaks develop in the obc data over the pbc results,\nand that these peaks move toward lower frequencies as\nL is increased.8 Actually, for V = 1.0, one can see that\nthe two largest obc peaks are located at \u03c9 \u223c 2\u03c0l/L,\n\nl = 1 and 3, similar to the noninteracting case. These results strongly suggest that in the TL, the finite frequency\npeaks for obc's will collapse into a single \u03c9 = 0 Drude\npeak like the one obtained for pbc's.\nIn Fig. 2(a), we show how \u2206 behaves with increasing\nsystem size for V = 1.0 and V = 2.0. [\u2206 is computed in\nthis case as two times the area over the dotted lines in\nFig. 1(b).] In both cases, the behavior of \u2206 is consistent\nwith extrapolated \u03c9 = 0 peaks with a finite weight in\nthe TL. Like for the noninteracting case, extrapolating\n\u2206 to L \u2192 \u221e does not reproduce the value of D\u221e obtained for systems with pbc's. This, we infer, is due to\nthe weight distributed over peaks with higher frequencies, which, following the noninteracting case, should all\ncollapse to \u03c9 = 0 as L \u2192 \u221e. The extrapolations in Fig.\n2(a) show that the relative weight of peaks with higher\n\u03c9 in chains with obc's increases as one departs from the\nnoninteracting case.\nHaving shed light on integrable systems, we now turn\nto the nonintegrable case. As mentioned before, in systems with pbc's, breaking integrability is expected to\nproduce an exponentially (with the system size) vanishing Drude weight. We first consider (Fig. 3) the case\nin which in Eq. (4) integrability is broken by t\u2032 , which\nalso breaks the particle-hole symmetry of the integrable\nmodel. In Fig. 3, one can see that, even for small finite\nsystems, introducing t\u2032 has dramatic effects in Re [\u03c3(\u03c9)].\nA peak develops at low frequencies. Given the sum rule\nfor Re [\u03c3(\u03c9)], such a peak can be related to the disappearance of the Drude peak and the transfer of its weight to\nfinite frequencies. Hence, the system acquires a finite dc\nconductivity, which decreases with increasing t\u2032 (Fig. 3).\nFor small finite systems with obc's, on the other hand,\nnothing dramatic should happen when a small t\u2032 is introduced. This is because in the integrable case, there\nis no zero frequency delta peak, but, instead, finite frequency peaks that are already present in the regular part\nof Re [\u03c3(\u03c9)].

The inset in (a) shows the low-frequency part of\nRe [\u03c3(\u03c9)] for the fermionic t-t\u2032 -V model together with a nonlinear fit (see text). In all cases, V = 2.0, \u03b2 = 0.001, and t\u2032 ,\nV , V \u2032 , \u03b2, and \u03c9 are given in units of t.\n\ntegrable chains with obc's only reduces the height of the\nlowest frequency peak in Re [\u03c3(\u03c9)] and, with increasing\nt\u2032 , its weight moves toward higher frequencies.\nAn apparent difference between Re [\u03c3(\u03c9)] in systems\nwith pbc's and systems with obc's (Fig. 3) is that, while\nthe former exhibit a finite dc conductivity, the latter\nexhibit a vanishing one. The vanishing of the dc conductivity for finite systems with obc's is understandable\nby using an analogy with pbc's with a small but finite\nmomentum q.

This means that at very low frequencies for obc's, Re [\u03c3(\u03c9)] \u223c \u03c9 2 . As shown in the\ninset in Fig. 4(a), our data are crudely consistent with\nthat. There,P\nwe also show the result of a nonlinear fit to\nRe [\u03c3(\u03c9)] = a=1,6 Ca \u03c9 a , where we find that C1 \u2243 0.\nFrom the previous analysis, one expects the region of\n\u03c9's over which Re [\u03c3(\u03c9)] \u2192 0 to reduce with increasing L\nand, eventually, in the TL, to recover the k = 0 result obtained for pbc's. In the main panel of Fig. 4(a), we depict\nresults for pbc's and obc's in systems with two different\nsizes. There, one can see that, indeed, for obc's, the lowfrequency region with decreasing conductivity moves to\nlower frequencies with increasing system size. In the TL,\nthe usual belief is that long time tails in the autocorrelation of the current will ultimately p\ntake over, asymptotically leading to Re [\u03c3(\u03c9)] \u223c A \u2212 B |\u03c9|.9\nWe should stress that our conclusions above are valid\nfor generic nonintegrable systems, i.e., they are not limited to the t-t\u2032 -V model presented in Figs. 3 and 4(a).\nFor example, in Fig. 4(b) we show that similar results\nare obtained when t\u2032 =0 but V \u2032 6=0 (t-V -V \u2032 model, main\npanel), and V \u2032 =0, t\u2032 6=0 (t-t\u2032 -V model), but for a system\nof hard-core bosons (inset). The last two models preserve\nthe particle-hole symmetry present in the integrable case,\nso our conclusions are also independent of its presence or\nabsence in nonintegrable systems.\nIn summary, we have argued that even though the real\npart of the conductivity in finite systems with obc's is\nqualitatively different from that of systems with pbc's,\nthey both have a common thermodynamic limit. For\nintegrable systems, this means that there is an infinite\ndc conductivity, characterized by a finite Drude weight.\nOn the other hand, for nonintegrable systems, the dc\nconductivity is finite and, in our 1D systems, it decreases\nas one moves away from the integrable point.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe acknowledge support from NSF-DMR-0706128 and\nDOE-BES DE-FG02-06ER46319.
