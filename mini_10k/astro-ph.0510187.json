Two kinds of\nstudies were carried out: search for periodic variations and for the occurrence of clusters of events. Different\nanalysis methods, including Lomb-Scargle spectral analysis and Scan Test statistics have been applied to\nthe data.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe high energy muon events collected by the MACRO apparatus at the average depth of 3600 m.w.e.\nrepresent one of the most extensive records of such kind of data. The series of these high-energy muons can\nbe to search for time variations of periodic and of stochastic characters, as it was done extensively by using\narrival times of EAS [1]. These variations in the underground muon flux may be due to different causes of\ngalactic, solar and terrestrial origin. The common problem for this type of searches is to determine whether\nan observed effect has occurred by chance of if it signals a departure from a pure random muon arrival.\nMACRO was a multipurpose modular apparatus with 6 supermodules with scintillator detectors, limited\nstreamer tubes and nuclear track detectors [2], and studied atmospheric neutrinos [3], aspects of CR physics\nand astrophysics [4], searched for GUT Magnetic Monopoles and other exotica [5]. Some interruptions\nof different kinds occurred during data taking, either randomly (e.g. power outages), or regularly (e.g.\nmaintenance), so appropriate statistical methods have to be applied and particular care should be used in\nchoosing periods of stationary conditions.\nIn the following we discuss the results of the searches for periodic variations and for time clustering of\nmuon events.\n\n2\n\nPeriodicity search. Spectrum analyses\n\nFor this analysis we considered data recorded by the streamer tube system in the time interval November\n1991-May 2000 and selected the data with the following criteria:\n- run duration longer than 1 hour;\n- streamer tube efficiencies of wires and strips larger than 90% and 70%, respectively, for each module;\n- all 6 super-modules in acquisition;\n- acquisition dead time smaller than 2.5% for the whole detector.\nThe total number of runs surviving these cuts was 6920 for a total number of 3.5 * 107 muon events.\nThe Fourier amplitude spectrum analysis is a powerful technique that allows a blind search for\nregular/persistent fluctuations in time series [6]. Such a technique, however, requires the input data to\n1\n\n\f10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n-3\n\n-2.5\n\n-2\n\n-1.5\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\np VS. log10(f*24)\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n-3\n\n-2.5\n\n-2\n\n-1.5\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\np VS. log10(f*24)\n\nFigure 1: Lomb power as a function of the Log10 of the frequency [days\u22121 ] for experimental data (upper\npanel). Note the high peak at \u223c \u22122.56 corresponding 365 days (seasonal flux variation). In the lower panel\nthe results of a Monte Carlo simulation having the same noise level of the real data with seasonal, solar\ndiurnal and sidereal waves [9] added.\n\nbe sampled at evenly spaced intervals; data gaps of variable length and occurring randomly in the serie\nproduce spurious contributions to the power that can mimic the presence of a periodicity. The LombScargle method [7] has been developed to mitigate this effect even in the case of very long data series.\nMoreover, as indicated in [8], it allows to evaluate the significance of the \"peaks\" (signal) with respect\nto a null hypothesis. The muon events were binned in 15 min time intervals and bins deviating by more\nthan 3\u03c3 from the monthly average rate were discarded. The total number of time bins used was 160242\ncorresponding to 58% of the whole sample.\nThe results of our analysis are shown in Fig. 1. We compare the spectrum obtained for the real data\nwith a Monte Carlo simulation having the same noise level and time intervals distributed according to the\nsequence of the original series. The seasonal, solar diurnal and sidereal waves [9] were also added in the\nserie. The spectrum of real data shows a power distribution similar to what observed in other cosmic ray\ndata series [6], i.e. a low frequency spectrum whose power decreases with frequency\u22122 . The most striking\nfeature of the spectrum is the large peak at \u223c \u22122.56 corresponding to the seasonal flux variation. Fig. 2\nshows a frequency region around the solar diurnal frequency where we have also indicated the frequencies\ncorresponding to the sidereal and anti-sidereal waves. The peak at frequency 1 day\u22121 has a statistical\nsignificance of \u223c 2.3\u03c3; the statistical significance assuming an oscillatory behaviour is \u223c 3.4\u03c3. Note that\npeaks corresponding to the diurnal and sidereal variations are observed, but peaks of similar size (or even\nlarger) are present elsewhere in the spectrum.

The arrows mark its position and the sidereal\nand anti-sidereal peaks.\n\nis based upon its occurrence at a frequency of \"a priori\" interest and on the stability of its amplitude and\nphase with time. We find that the amplitudes and the probabilities for the null hypothesis computed by\nthe two methods are in fair agreement with the ones obtained using a standard \"folding\" method [9].\n\n3\n\nBurst search: time interval distribution\n\nThe first method used in searching for correlations in the arrival times was the study of the time interval\ndistribution. For each muon arriving at time t0 we calculated the distribution of the time interval elapsed\nbetween the first muon t0 and the next five muons: ti -t0 , i=1,...,5, see Fig. 3. A complete analysis was\npublished in [10]. Here we report the results for the direction bands with 0\u25e6 < RA< 360\u25e6 and 25< decl\n< 50\u25e6 that include the Cyg X-3 region. The experimental distributions show some deviations from the\nmuon random arrival expectation. The probability computed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test shows\nsome disagreement (prob=0.38) but the available statistics is too poor to reach clear conclusions.\n\n4\n\nBurst search: scan statistics\n\nScan statistics is a powerful method to search for bursts of events. It is a bin-free method and it provides\nunbiased results when data are analysed (see [11] and references therein). We used scan statistics in the\nfollowing way: for each run i, let [Ai , Bi ] be the time interval ranging from the start and the end of the run.\nWe open a \"time window\" of fixed length w and scan the interval [Ai , Bi ] counting the number of events\nfalling inside w. ki is the maximum number of events recorded during the scan. Finally, for each run, we\ncompute the probability Pi that a statistical fluctuation would produce a burst of events as large as ki . The\nonly choice is the size of w. We tried different sizes (w = 30 s, 5 min and 15 min) and for each of them\nwe analysed the probability distribution Pi , i=1, Nrun . In Fig. 4 we show the probability distribution for\nthe 6113 runs surviving our cuts: w = 30 s above, 5 min at the centre and 15 min below. No significant\ndeviations from the null hypothesis is found; we also inspected unusual runs with probabilities smaller than\n5 * 10\u22124 and we found that the \"bumps\" of events were concentrated near the beginning or end of the runs.\n\n3\n\n\fFigure 3: Time interval distributions (from top left to bottom left clockwise) for t2 -t0 , t3 -t0 , t5 -t0 and t4 -t0 ,\nrespectively, for a cone of arrival directions with declination 25\u25e6 < \u03b4 < 50\u25e6 .

The Lomb-Scargle method was used in the first case, scan statistics in the\nsecond. The two techniques complete early analyses performed with \"folding\" methods in searching for\nperiodicities and time differences for burst events. No deviations from the expected distributions were\nfound.\n\n6\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank the members of the MACRO Collaboration and the personnel of the LNGS for their cooperation.\nH.D. and S.M. thank the Abdus Salam ICTP TRIL Programme for providing fellowships.
