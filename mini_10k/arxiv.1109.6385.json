Introduction\nA subdivision rule is a recursive way of combinatorially dividing a tiling on a surface into a smaller, more\nrefined tiling. Barycentric subdivision is an example, as is hexagonal refinement, both of which we will\nexplore later. Subdivision rules have been studied extensively by Cannon, Floyd, and Parry in an attempt to\nprove that all hyperbolic groups with a 2-sphere at infinity are hyperbolic 3-manifold groups; as a corollary,\nthis would give a simple proof of the hyperbolization conjecture, now proved by Perelman.\nWhile investigating these hyperbolic groups with a 2-sphere at infinity, they showed (in [6]) that all such\ngroups have an associated finite subdivision rule on the sphere. Cannon showed in [1] that, if a subdivision rule associated to a group satisfies two simple axioms, then the group acts on the sphere by M\u00f6bius\ntransformations, and on hyperbolic 3-space by isometries, cocompactly and properly discontinuously.\nTo state the axioms, we need to define combinatorial modulus. Combinatorial modulus is a direct analog of\nthe modulus of a topological annulus or quadrilateral in complex analysis. In that setting, every topological\nannulus or quadrilateral is conformally equivalent to a standard annulus or quadrilateral, and the modulus\nis defined by how thick or thin the resulting annulus or quadrilateral is.\nA conformal map can be thought of as a change in metric; finding the classical modulus, then, is finding an\noptimal metric in some sense. Combinatorial modulus is defined to mirror this.\nA tiling T of a ring R (i.e., a closed annulus) gives two invariants, Msup (R, T ) and minf (R, T ), called\napproximate moduli. These are similar to the classical modulus of a ring. They are defined by the use\nof weight functions. A weight function \u03c1 assigns a non-negative number called a weight to each tile of\nT . Every path in R can be given a length, defined to be the sum of the weights of all tiles in the path.\nWe define the height H(\u03c1) of R under \u03c1 to be the infimum of the length of all possible paths connecting\nthe inner boundary of R to the outer boundary. The circumference C(\u03c1) of R under \u03c1 is the infimum of\nthe length of all possible paths circling the ring (i.e. not nullhomotopic in R). The area A(\u03c1) of R under\n2\n\u03c1 is defined to be the sum of the squares of all weights in R. Then we define Msup (R, T ) = sup H(\u03c1)\nA(\u03c1) and\n\u03c1\n\nA(\u03c1)\n2.\n\u03c1 C(\u03c1)\n\nminf (R, T ) = inf\n\nNote that they are invariant under scaling of the metric.\n\nA sequence T1 , T2 , ... of tilings is conformal (K) if mesh approaches 0 and:\nDate: October 8, 2018.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nBRIAN RUSHTON\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b2\nFigure 1. Fat paths go around vertices, skinny paths go through them.\n(1) for each ring R, the approximate moduli Msup (R, Ti ) and minf (R, Ti ), for all i sufficiently large, lie\nin a single interval of the form [r, Kr]; and\n(2) given a point x in the surface, a neighborhood N of x, and an integer I, there is a ring R in N \\ {x}\nseparating x from the complement of N , such that for all large i the approximate moduli of R are\nall greater than I.\nNote that mesh approaching 0 is independent of topological metric.\nThese are the two axioms mentioned earlier. The first axiom is similar to equicontinuity of maps, and the\nsecond shows that points do not blow up. In Section 2, we give an example of a subdivision rule satisfying\naxiom 1 but not axiom 2.\nOne way to achieve an intuitive understanding of these axioms is by circle packings. Ha\u0131\u0308ssinsky showed that,\nif a sequence of tilings is conformal, then some subsequence of its circle packings will converge to a limit\nmap (if we normalize the circle packings by fixing the image of three points). Thus, throughout this paper,\nwe will use circle packings as a way of studying modulus.\n\n2. Barycentric Subdivision\nCannon and Swenson have shown [6] that the subdivision rules arising from closed hyperbolic manifolds are\nconformal. Later, Cannon, Floyd and Parry [5] showed that barycentric subdivision does not satisfy Axiom\n1. We show that by altering the definition of weightings, we can make barycentric subdivision satisfy Axiom\n1 on a basis of annuli, but not Axiom 2.\nWe will use the Layer Theorem [5]. This theorem says that the modulus of an annulus is greater than the\nsum of the moduli of any disjoint collection of essential sub-annuli. In other words, if you stack several rings\ntogether, you get a ring at least as big as all of them put together.\nThe modulus of a quadrilateral or annulus corresponds to an optimal weighting of the shinglings of the\nquadrilateral. The reason that unbounded valence subdivision rules have been difficult to study before is\nthat the optimal weight vectors corresponding to a quadrilateral or annulus with tilings of large valence are\nasymmetrical. Specifically, Cannon, Floyd and Parry showed [4] that optimizing a quadrilateral to measure\nits height in the traditional, 'fat' way (counting all shingles that intersect a path) measures its width in a\n'skinny' way (counting any one set of shingles that covers the path). See Figure 1. If many edges come\ninto a single vertex, the fat height paths have to go all the way around the vertex, while the skinny width\npaths can sneak through the vertex. Thus, even rotationally symmetric tilings with high valence will have\ndegenerate moduli.\n\n\fMODULUS OF UNBOUNDED VALENCE SUBDIVISION RULES\n\n3\n\nFigure 2. Blowing up a vertex.\n\nFigure 3. A square in a triangulation.\n\nFigure 4. The same square after one subdivision.\n\nMy idea is to show that barycentric subdivision satisfies Axiom 1 on a basis of annuli if we change how\nwe place weights. We either place weights at the vertices, or blow up the vertices by replacing each vertex\nwith a closed disk (see Figure 2). Blowing up the vertices gives a new tiling with all vertices have valence\n3. Placing weights at the vertices (and requiring paths to be edge paths) is equivalent to taking the dual\ntiling, where, again, all vertices have valence 3 (because all tiles of barycentric subdivision are triangles). In\nthese settings, 'skinny' and 'fat' sets of shingles are the same, because any two tiles sharing a vertex share an\nedge. Thus, the height and width are measured in a symmetrical way. Because of this symmetry, Theorem\n2.4.5.1 of [4] shows that minf = Msup for all rings at all stages of subdivision. Thus, we can speak of 'the'\ncombinatorial modulus.\nOur future calculations will not depend on the method we choose, as long as fat and skinny are the same.\nOne motivation in putting weights on the vertices is circle packings; a circle packing assigns a weight to each\nvertex (i.e the radius of the circle).\nNow, we perform some calculations. Consider two adjacent triangular tiles an any stage of barycentric\nsubdivision. Together, they form a square. Notice in Figures 3, 4 that reflection about the common edge\npreserves the tiling (i.e. cell structure) and swaps cuts and flows; in the language of Cannon, Floyd, and\nParry, there is a weak isomorphism taking cuts to flows and vice versa [5]. So the optimal height and length\nof the square must be equal, and either combinatorial modulus of the square must be exactly one.\nNow, consider the star of any vertex. It consists of some number n of triangles arranged about the vertex.\nWhen we subdivide, we can remove the new star about the vertex (consisting of 2n tiles) to get an annulus.\nThis annulus consists of 2n square of the type considered above, arranged with alternating orientations.\n\n\f4\n\nBRIAN RUSHTON\n\nFigure 5. The star of every vertex contains an annulus made of squares.\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1'\n\nFigure 6. If we consider the annulus as four squares with edges identified, we can reflect\nany cut of the annulus so that it lies in one given square.\nLet \u03b1 be a cut in the annulus (i.e. an arc connecting the ends of the annulus). Then pick any square in the\nannulus, and notice that reflecting \u03b1 every time it touches the boundary of the square gives us an arc that\nremains entirely in the square, while having the exact same length (see Figure 6). Thus, the height of the\nannulus is equal to the height of the square, and the are is equal to n times the area of the square (after\nwe multiply by an appropriate constant). Thus, both moduli are n1 . This class of annuli, therefore, satisfy\nAxiom 1.\nHowever, we cannot layer these annuli to get larger annuli which we know to be of unbounded modulus.\n1\nTo see this, notice that the next smaller annulus has 2n squares and has modulus 2n\n, and, in general, the\n1\n(k + 1)th annulus has modulus 2k n , and layering all of these together gives us a larger annulus which has\n\u221e\n\n\u03a3\n\nk=0\n\n1\n2k n\n\n=\n\n2\nn\n\nas a lower bound for its modulus. The exponential growth about the vertex makes the modulus\n\nshrink too quickly. This contrasts strongly with the finite valence case, in which we have nested annuli with\n\n\fMODULUS OF UNBOUNDED VALENCE SUBDIVISION RULES\n\nA\n\nB\nA\n\nA\nA\n\nB\n\n5\n\nB\nA\n\nB\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nFigure 7. One subdivision rule for the Borromean rings. All polyhedra are octahedra.\n\nidentical moduli that sum to infinity. In the next section, we will consider subdivision rules that have linear\ngrowth at each vertex, and which thus have annuli of unbounded size.\nWhile we don't have an upper bound for the size of the annuli, Circlepack suggests that such a limit exists.\nIf a basis of annuli satisfy Axiom 1 and Axiom 2, the circle packings will converge to a limit function on the\nsphere [7]. However, the packings for barycentric subdivision seem to converge to a relation in which the\nset of vertices is mapped to a dense set of disks. See the figure on page 12. Note that all points that are\nnot vertices are contained in the double star of a new vertex at every stage of subdivision. The star of each\n1\nof these vertices contains an annulus surrounding the point of modulus 12\nor 18 for all sufficiently refined\nstages of subdivision. Thus, we can layer to get unbounded moduli in this case. This means that, under a\nsequence of circle packings, the complement of the vertices is mapped homeomorphically (by Arzela-Ascoli\nand the fact that locally conformal circle packings are locally equicontinuous [7]) to a subset of the sphere,\ni.e. the complement of the disks, which is similar to a Julia set.\nThis is related to the work of Cannon, Floyd and Parry on subdivision rules and rational maps [2], in\nwhich they showed that many subdivision rules can be realized as a rational map on the sphere, where the\nsubdivision rule is obtained by pulling back a cell structure on the sphere. Conformal subdivision rules have\na Julia set that is the entire sphere, but the map associated to barycentric subdivision has a Sierpsinski\ncarpet as its Julia set.\n\n3. Borromean Rings\nIn contrast to barycentric subdivision, a subdivision rule associated with the Borromean rings is conformal,\nalthough the valence at each vertex remains unbounded.\nThe tile types are shown in Figure 7. The dot indicates the orientation of the B tiles.\nLet's examine the star of a vertex. Each new vertex in the subdivision rule, after all tiles around it have\nbeen subdivided once, has a star of the form shown in Figure 8.\nAfter another subdivision, we have Figure 9. Note the marked annulus.\nNotice that this annulus can be reflected twice in between neighboring B tiles to get a quadrilateral of the\nform shown in Figure 10. Several B tiles have had their bottom halves cut off.\nBut we can fold this up into itself as shown in Figure 11\n\n\f6\n\nBRIAN RUSHTON\n\n.\n.\n.\n\nB\n\n.\n\nB A B\n\nA\nB\n\nB\n\n.\n\nA B\n.\n\nB .\nA\n.\nB\n\nFigure 8.

In one final step, we unfold our shape to get\nsomething with modulus 1, as shown in Figure 13.\nThis final shape (call it Q) has modulus 1 in all stages of subdivision, as it has a symmetry interchanging\nthe top/bottom with the left/right. We can now estimate the modulus of the original annulus by \"pulling\nback\" the weighting given to this tile. We do this by undoing each step.\nPutting back the fold in Figure 13, we get something with the same height as Q, but with less area than\nthat of Q. Thus, the modulus is at least 1. Undoing the steps in Figure 12 at most doubles the area, giving\n\n\fMODULUS OF UNBOUNDED VALENCE SUBDIVISION RULES\n\nB\n.\n\nB\n\nB\nA\n\n.\n\nA\n\n7\n\nA\n\n.\n\nA\n\nB/2\n\nB/2\nA\nB/2 .\n\n.\n\n.

The subdivision rule takes triangles\nand subdivides them into four smaller triangles by connecting midpoints of edges (see the figure on page 11).\nWhile it is easy to calculate the exact modulus of annuli in this sequence of tilings, we give lower bounds for\nthe modulus as in our other examples.\nAt every stage of subdivision, every vertex is surrounded by an annulus of 18 triangles, as shown in Figure\n15. By reflection, we can consider a single quadrilateral as shown in Figure 16. Note that, by the reflection\nshown in that figure, we can assume that any cuts remain in the right two triangles. These last triangles,\nby the reflection shown in Figure 17, have modulus 1. Working backwards, we see that the quadrilateral in\n1\n.\nFigure 16 has modulus \u2265 12 . Thus, the entire annulus in Figure 15 has modulus \u2265 12\nIn contrast to barycentric subdivision and the Borromean rings, the annuli surrounding a given vertex at\n1\neach stage have a fixed, constant size C \u2265 12\n. Thus, layering gives us annuli of modulus \u2265 Cn at stage n,\nand so axioms 1 and 2 are satisfied at each vertex. This easy layering for finite valence subdivision rules is\na small part of why Cannon, Floyd, and Parry were able to replace axioms 1 and 2 with a simpler axiom 0\nfor finite valence subdivision rules [3]:\n\n\fMODULUS OF UNBOUNDED VALENCE SUBDIVISION RULES\n\n9\n\nFigure 15. Eventually, at every stage of subdivision, every vertex is surrounded by an\nannulus of this form.\n\nFigure 16. The annulus in Figure 15 is made of 6 quadrilaterals of this form. By reflection,\nwe can assume that all cuts stay in two neighboring triangles.\n\nFigure 17. This square has modulus one, even after several stages of subdivision.\nAxiom 0. Given x \u2208 Y and a neighborhood N of x, there is a ring R in N surrounding x such that the\nmoduli m(R, Ti ) are bounded away from 0.\nNote that the estimate for every vertex in hexagonal refinement is the same at every stage; this is reflected\nin its circle packing on page 11.\n5. Generalizations\nNotice that the key ideas in the estimates for our three subdivision rules were:\n(1) Finding pieces of modulus 1, and\n(2) Showing that we need only consider cuts that remain in these pieces.\nOne powerful technique related to these ideas is the 1,2,3-tile criterion of Cannon, Floyd, and Parry [5].\nEssentially, a subdivision rule satisfies the criterion if every 'test quadrilateral' formed from one or two tiles\n\n\f10\n\nBRIAN RUSHTON\n\nin a row (or three if the middle one is a triangle) has modulus uniformly bounded away from 0. This criterion\nallows us to argue as we did in the three cases above to provide estimates.\nThere are three types of test quadrilaterals:\nType I. The quadrilateral Q consists of one tile, and each of the ends of Q consists of one edge.\nType II. The quadrilateral Q consists of two tiles whose intersection consists of one edge f , and each of the\nends of Q consists of one edge which meets f . We call f the interior edge of Q.\nType III. The quadrilateral Q consists of three tiles t1 , t2 and t3 , where t2 is a triangle with edges f1 , f2 , and\nf3 . The intersection of t1 and t2 is f1 , and the intersection of t2 and t3 is f3 . The intersection of t1 and t3\nis a vertex v. The top of Q consists of an edge containing v, and the bottom of Q is f2 . We call f1 and f3\nthe interior edges of Q.\nCannon, Floyd and Parry showed that a uniform lower bound on the modulus of all test quadrilaterals\n(call it M) gives a lower bound for the modulus of a ring R in our surface, depending on the size of the\nring. Specifically, in the proof of Theorem 5.1 in [5], they take the star of a simple closed curve \u03b1 in some\nsubdivision Ri of the ring, where \u03b1 misses every vertex, and show that any flow curve from the bottom of this\nstar to the top must join the ends of a test quadrilateral (i.e. its image in some test quadrilateral is a cut).\nThey then give the star of \u03b1 a weight vector that is the sum of all optimal weightings of test quadrilaterals,\nM\n, where k is the number of tiles in the\nnormalized to have area 1. The star of \u03b1, then, has modulus \u2265 Ak\nstar of \u03b1 in Ri and A is the maximum area a single tile can have under the weighted sum (which is seen to\nbe bounded, as the number of test quadrilaterals a single tile can lie in is uniformly bounded).\nWhen the star of a vertex v in a subdivided surface S is a disk, we can take its boundary and push it slightly\noutward to be such an \u03b1. The number of tiles in the star of \u03b1 will then be \u2264 Bi (v)vali (v), where Bi (v) is\nthe maximum valence of vertices surrounding v. In a subdivision rule with combinatorial mesh going to 0,\neach vertex v has a uniform bound on Bi (v), as each edge surrounding the vertex is subdivided periodically.\nThus, we see that any annulus containing the star of \u03b1 must have modulus \u2265 valCi (v) for some constant C..\nBy nesting this sequence of annuli, we can construct an annulus of larger modulus. When valence grows\nexponentially at each vertex, as in barycentric subdivision, we get a geometric sequence of estimates of the\nsize of annuli, and we cannot construct annuli whose modulus estimates are unbounded. I conjecture that\nevery subdivision rule with exponential growth at each vertex which satisfies the 1,2,3-tile criterion will satisfy\naxiom 1 but not axiom 2, just like barycentric subdivision. In this case, the limit of circle packings will be a\ncontinuous relation instead of a continuous function onto the sphere, where points are blown up into disks.\nIn [9], there are subdivision rules for hyperbolic 3-manifolds with hyperbolic surface boundary; I conjecture\nthat all such subdivision rules satisfy the 1,2,3-tile criterion and behave like barycentric subdivision at each\nvertex corresponding to a hyperbolic surface in the boundary.\nNesting annuli in a subdivision rule of linear growth gives us a harmonic series for our estimates, which\nshows that all such subdivision rules that satisfy the 1,2,3-tile criterion are conformal. I conjecture that all\nthe subdivision rules arising from alternating links in [8] satisfy this criterion, and are conformal.\nFinally, subdivision rules of bounded valence give a linear modulus estimate, and those that satisfy the\n1,2,3-tile criterion are conformal, which was why Cannon, Floyd and Parry originally proved the criterion in\n[5].\n\n6.
