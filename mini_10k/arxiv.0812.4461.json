The content typically has a latent structure and latent, interrelated topics: this has resulted in a Social Networking Divide.\nRecent advances toward a more Open Social Networking (OSN) paradigm are\nfocused on (de facto) standards, and only address part of the problem. Specifically, current OSN efforts attempt to handle issues related to the portability of\ndata, common APIs (e.g., Google OpenSocial1 ), and social graphs, e.g., FOAF2 ,\nXHTML Friends Network3 .\nWe posit that open social networking is more than an agreed upon \"language\"\nfor describing relationships and sharing data across systems. In addition, it is\nthe exploitation of social activities in one site, to support the discovery of new\ninterrelationships within a community. This is crucial, given that it is becoming\n1\n2\n3\n\nhttp://code.google.com/opensocial\nhttp://www.foaf-project.org/\nhttp://gmpg.org/xfn/\n\n\f2\n\nAvar\u00e9 Stewart, Ernesto Diaz-Aviles, Wolfgang Nejdl\n\nincreasingly difficult for seekers to cope with the cognitive challenges of efficiently\nfinding and effectively analyzing relevant information, when inundated with its\nvolume, variety and evolution.\n1.1\n\nScenario\n\nTo motivate the aforementioned ideas, consider the following scenario in which\nthere are two social network sites. In one site, a Blogger.com 4 , music community,\nthe main activities are writing text about artists, tracks, albums or music videos.\nBloggers create explicit links to other participants to express their preferred blogs\n(via a blogroll). In the other site: Last.fm 5 , the users listen to music tracks, tag\nthese tracks and build friendship relationships.\nSymbiotically, the social activities in one site can have an impact on the\nother site. Blogger.com bloggers do not tag the entities about which they write.\nHowever, the tagging activity can better help bloggers see the structure in their\ncommunity and find new information. Conversely, Last.fm users do not provide\nprose for the tracks they listen to, but such prose can be a valuable source of\nmetadata for audio tracks.\nIn Figure 1, a navigation tool is depicted, in which the Blogger.com site has\nbeen enriched with information from Last.fm. The graph represents the similarity between (potentially unknown) bloggers on the set of tracks they have\nwritten about in their blogs. By selecting a node in the graph, the list if tracks\nthat blogger has mentioned in their blogsite is presented, along with the overall\npopularity of these tracks. Also depicted in the figure are the tags from Last.fm,\nwhich can be used to filter the nodes and edges in the graph. The tool supports navigation and visualization of latent concepts and relations within, and\nacross the sites. One of the challenges in realizing such a scenario is that the concepts and structure within -and across domains- are latent. Specifically within\nblogs, the topics to which the blog site is devoted, are very often not made explicit. Furthermore, the readership relationship is typically unobserved; and the\nblogroll relationship, though observed, is often unexplained. Finally, standards\nmay support, but do not address, how the social practices in one domain may\nbe exploited to support bloggers in another similar social site; particularly when\nresources of different types are being mapped.\nThe contributions of this work are: 1) extension of the commonly held view\nto open social networking: to infer new relationships and resources, and provide\nsupport with navigation and visualization across comparable social networks; 2)\nintegration music bloggers with music listeners; bridging the gap between different types of social networking systems; 3) examination of the blogroll relationship\nin the music domain based an open social networking approach.\nIn Section 2 we discuss related research in cross domain discovery. In Section 3\nwe present the conceptual approach to open social networking in the music\ndomain. In Section 4 experimental results are presented and in Section 5 we\nconclude and discuss future work.\n4\n5\n\nhttp://www.blogger.com\nhttp://www.last.fm\n\n\fMining User Profiles in OSN\n\n3\n\nFig. 1: Cross System Visualization Blogger.com and Last.fm\n\n2\n\nRelated Work\n\nIn machine learning, cross domain discovery [1] or domain adaptation [2] is a\nbody of work in which multiple information sources from comparable, but different domains are combined. Work done in this area has focused on classification\ntasks, in which labeled data exists in abundance in one domain, but a statistical\nmodel that performs well on a related domain is desired. Since hand-labeling in\nthe new domain is costly, one often wishes to leverage the original out-of-domain\ndata when building a model of the new, in-domain data [3].\nAlso in the area of machine learning, the method of View Completion [4], has\nused collaborative tags to heuristically complete missing or inadequate feature\nsets (or views). The basic premise underlying view completion, is that for many\ntasks, combining multiple information sources yields significantly better results\nthan using just a single one alone. Views are used in this case, since that blogs\nare not typically available on collaborative tagging websites, and as such the\ntags provided by bloggers suffer from the vocabulary problem and cannot be\nadequately used as a shared index.\nAnother related area is Cross-System Personalization [5] which enables personalization information across different systems to be shared. In digital libraries,\ncross system personalization is used to overcome the problem that information\nneeded to support a personalized user experience is not shared among different\nlibraries. In other work, the focus has been on adequate representations of [6,7],\nand dependencies between [8] the user's profile, to support a unified representation in the different systems. These approaches are ego-centric in that they\nassume the same user to exist across different systems; and that the user is in-\n\n\f4\n\nAvar\u00e9 Stewart, Ernesto Diaz-Aviles, Wolfgang Nejdl\n\nterested in an aggregated view of their profile or social networking information.\nThis is not the case in an open social networking environment, where users are\nassumed to be similar (in some way), but have distinct digital identities. Our\nview is a socio-centric one and focuses on common patterns in the community\nas a whole.\nWork exists, in the area of association mining [9,10]. In [9] the goal is to\nprovide a seamless navigation between tag spaces. The work presented in [10]\nmerges the areas of formal concept analysis and association rule mining to discover shared conceptualizations that are hidden in folksonomies. They present\na formalism for folksonomies that includes a set U of users, a set T of tags, and\na set R of resources, represented by the ternary relation, Y . In our work, it is\nthe set, T , of tags in the ternary relation that we propagate from one site to\nenrich another. Furthermore, we propose, that \"citizen-defined\" structuring (i.e.\nblogroll, friends, or comment networks) allow other types of ternary relations to\nbe inferred, that are not restricted to the user-tag-resource triple.\n\n3\n\nOpen Social Networking: the Music Domain\n\nOpen social networking, has two-fold goal: 1)improve the structure of information within a single site and 2)exploit the social activities in a different sites to\nenhance the activities in comparable ones. Toward this end, two aspects are considered: a representation for the activities within each social site; and mapping\nparts of the data and structures from one social site to another, to augment the\nsocial activities therein.\n3.1\n\nTerminology\n\nWe adopt the definition of a folksonomy as described by Hotho et al. [10,11], as\na four-tuple6 , F := (U, T, R, Y ) , where:\n\u2022 U ,T and R are finite sets, whose elements are called users, tags and resources,\nrespectively, and\n\u2022 Y a ternary relation between them, i.e. Y \u2286 U \u00d7 T \u00d7 R, whose elements are\ncalled tag assignments.\nFor the music domain, the set of resources are considered to be artists, tracks\nand albums. Additionally, we distinguish the different roles a site may have when\ndescribing the mappings between them. A target site, or in-domain site, is the\none onto which data from another social site is mapped. The out-of-domain site\nis the social site from which data is extracted to augment the comparable, target\nsite. The roles of in- and out-of-domain may be interchanged depending upon\nintegration goals, and there may be multiple out-of-domain sites. For the purpose\nof this work, we consider Blogger.com and Last.f m to be the in-domain site\nand out-of-domain site, respectively.\n6\n\nIn the original definition [10,11], it is additionally introduced a subtag/supertag\nrelation, which we omit for the purpose of this paper.\n\n\fMining User Profiles in OSN\n\n3.2\n\n5\n\nCross-Site Enrichment\n\nWe represent the Blogger.com music community conceptually as tuples, B :=\n{(ub , rb ) | (ub , rb ) \u2208 UBlogger.com \u00d7 RBlogger.com }, since Blogger.com bloggers do\nnot tag the entities about which they write. On the other hand, the Last.fm\nsocial site is ripe with tag data of the form L := {(ul , tl , rl ) | (ul , tl , rl ) \u2208\nULast.f m \u00d7 TLast.f m \u00d7 RLast.f m }, representing the tag a given user has applied to\na track within Last.fm. Then the mapping of tags onto Blogger.com is computed\nas follows:\nY := {(u, t, r) | (u, t, r) \u2208 \u03c0ub ,tl ,rb (\u03c3rb =rl (B \u00d7 L))}\n\n(1)\n\nwere \u03c3 and \u03c0 are the relational algebra operators for selection and projection,\nrespectively.\nFirst, from the cartesian product B \u00d7 L, the tuples with equal resources in\nboth sites are selected, and then the projection is taken over the Blogger.com\nusers, the Last.fm tags, and the common resource elements. In general, the user\nsets are considered to be disjoint, i.e., UBlogger.com \u2229 ULast.f m = \u2205.\n3.3\n\nSite-Specific Enrichment\n\nThe (hidden) relationships between blogs and/or bloggers can be exploited to\ninfer relationships between the entities within the blog site. However, even within\na single blog community, the relationships between resources, may not be well\nunderstood. For this reason, we undertake an exploratory analysis of the blogroll\nrelationship.\n\n4\n\nExperiments\n\nThe experimental goals are to first examine the explicit blogroll structure; laying the foundation for further analysis of an ideal or \"optimal\" resource-specific\nblogrolls. Resource specific blogrolls are those in which the nature of the blogroll\nis assumed to be explained in terms similarity in tastes for a given type of resource, i.e., track, or artist. Then, to investigate the extent to which these optimal resource-specific blogrolls: overlap with the explicit blogrolls; and with each\nother. In the remainder of this discussion \"'optimal\"' resource-specific blogrolls\nis referred to as optimal blogrolls.\n4.1\n\nData Set\n\nFor Cross System Music Blog Mining, we used two data sets: one data set\nconsisted of personal music blogs from Blogger.com, one of the most popular\nblogsites, whereas the second data set consisted of tagged tracks from Last.f m,\na radio and music community website and one of the largest social music platforms. The details of each data set are presented in this section.\n\n\f6\n\nAvar\u00e9 Stewart, Ernesto Diaz-Aviles, Wolfgang Nejdl\n\nBlogger.com Community: The blogroll relationship induces a network representing a preferential reading of others people's blogs. The network data was\ncollected by experimentally selecting seed bloggers using several music directories7 and limiting the bloggers selected to the genre of pop and rock music in the Blogger.com domain. The blogroll for each seed was traversed, fanning out in a breath-first order, yielding a total number of bloggers equal to\n|UBlogger.com | = 976.\nSummary statistics for the overall structure and topological statistics for the\nlargest five weak components are given in Table 1, from there it can be seen that\nthe components exhibit varying structural properties and that the structural\nview provided by the blogroll is a disjointed one.\nIn addition to the community data, profiles were built by parsing the tracks\nin the user's blog and relying upon a dictionary of tracks gathered from MusicBrainz.org8. A total of 2196 unique tracks were collected; and for these tracks,\na total 147801 Last.fm tags were obtained, which allowed us to construct the\ntriples.\nTable 1: Blogger.com Community Statistics and Components\nAvg.\nMax.\nNo.\nNo. Weak\nComponent Component\nNodes Edges Components Size\nSize\n976\n2011 72\n13.55\n662\nComp.\nId\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\n4.2\n\nNo.\nNodes\n662\n53\n28\n19\n16\n\nNo.\nEdges\n1755\n62\n27\n20\n15\n\nAvg.\nCluster\nCoef.\n0.492\n0.574\n0.964\n0.526\n0.751\n\nShortest\nAverage\nDistance\n2.797\n2.113\n0.964\n2.0\n1.687\n\nMin.\nComponent Reciprocal\nSize\nEdges\n2\n581\nLongest\nAverage\nDistance\n8.134\n5.811\n1.892\n4.684\n3.187\n\nReciprocal\nEdges\n568\n13\n0\n0\n0\n\nExperimental Results\n\nBlogroll Quality Based on Tracks and Tags We investigate the extent\nto which the explicit blogroll relationship, within the in-domain site, can be\n7\n\n8\n\nhttp://www.musicblogscatalog.com/\nhttp://yocheckthisjam.com/music-blog-directory/\nhttp://www.blogged.com/directory/entertainment/music/rock\nhttp://www.blogcatalog.com/directory/music/rock\nhttp://www.musicbrainz.org\n\n\fMining User Profiles in OSN\n\n7\n\nTable 2: Average similarity and overlap of the blogroll B and optimal blogroll\nB\u2217\nProfile\nAvgSim(B) AvgSim(B \u2217) Improvement (%) Avg(|B \u2229 B \u2217 |)\nTrack-Based 0.295\n0.547\n85%\n1.48 \u2248 1 blogger, with\nprobability = 0.085\nTag-Based 0.293\n0.645\n120%\n1.37 \u2248 1 blogger, with\nprobability = 0.081\n\ndescribed by the similarity between track and tag profiles.

Table 2 summarizes\nthe results.\n\u2217\nBR\nand BT\u2217 Overlap measures the extent to which optimal blogrolls, computed\nwith track and tag profiles, agree on his members. We found that 77.66% of the\ntime they agree on at least one member, and the average of the overlap in\n\u2217\nthese cases is Avg(|BR\n\u2229 BT\u2217 |) = 4.64 \u2248 5 bloggers out of 10 (the fixed size of\nthe optimal blogrolls). The distribution of the intersection size for the optimal\nblogrolls is presented in Fig. 4.\n9\n\nThe 20000 most popular tags were used to build the profiles, i.e. |T | = 20000\n\n\f8\n\nAvar\u00e9 Stewart, Ernesto Diaz-Aviles, Wolfgang Nejdl\n120\nB\nB*\n\n110\nCumulative Frequency (%)\n\n100\n90\n\n(0.5, 89.52)\n\n80\n70\n60\n50\n\n(0.5, 50.73)\n\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\nSimilarity based on Track Profiles\n\n(a)\n120\nB\nB*\n\n110\nCumulative Frequency (%)\n\n100\n90\n(0.5,83.56)\n\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n\n(0.5,35.68)\n\n30\n20\n10\n0\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8\nSimilarity based on Tag Profiles\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 2: Cumulative Frequency for the explicit blogroll B and the optimal B \u2217\ncomputed using (a) Track Profiles and (b) Tag Profiles.\n\n4.3\n\nDiscussion\n\nFrom Table 2, it can be observed that the improvement, in terms of similarity,\nwhen computing B \u2217 based on tracks is 85%, and 120% when tag profiles are\nused. The table also shows that the overlap between the explicit and optimal\nblogrolls, computed either with track or tag profiles, occurs only 9% of the time,\ncorresponding to an average of a single blogger in those cases.\nFurthermore, the optimal blogroll similarity distributions are better than the\none produced by the explicit relationships, as shown in Fig. 3, which corresponds\nto the absolute frequencies of the explicit and optimal blogrols, for different\nvalues of similarity. The frequencies of optimal blogrolls, for similarity values\nover 0.5, are higher than the ones for explicit blogrolls.\nThe cumulative frequency of blogrolls over discrete similarity bins is presented in Fig. 2, which shows that both the track-based (49.27%) and tag-based\n(64.32%) optimal blogrolls exhibit good similarity quality, i.e., over 0.50, in contrast to the respective explicit blogrolls, where just less than 11% of them in the\ncase of track-based profiles (resp., 16.44% for tag-based) fall in bins corresponding to similarity values over 0.5.\n\n\fMining User Profiles in OSN\n\n9\n\n35\nB\nB*\n30\n\nFrequency (%)\n\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\nSimilarity based on Track Profiles\n\n(a)\n35\nB\nB*\n30\n\nFrequency (%)\n\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8\nSimilarity based on Tag Profiles\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 3: Frequency Distribution for the explicit blogroll B and the optimal B \u2217\ncomputed using (a) Track Profiles and (b) Tag Profiles.\nTag based computations perform better than using tracks, i.e., builds optimal\nblogrolls with higher values of similarity, this can be explained by the fact that\ntags capture some structure of the domain, e.g., genre, improving the overlap\nbetween user profiles when computing the similarity measure.\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper, we explored to what extent the knowledge and structures from\none social site (out-of-domain) can be adequately exploited to provide new information and resources to the users in a comparable social site (in-domain), in\nparticular for a music blog community within the Blogger.com social network.\nAn examination of the explicit blogroll structure, which is assumed to express\na preferential reading of others people's blogs, has revealed that bloggers tend\nto produce sub-optimal blogrolls when measuring the similarity between users\nbased on track, as well as tags. The implication for this is that if users are interested in learning about tracks, tags or other bloggers, some assistance to guide\nthem is needed. On the other hand, neither tracks nor tags comes close to fully\n\"explaining\" the nature of the blogroll.\n\n\f10\n\nAvar\u00e9 Stewart, Ernesto Diaz-Aviles, Wolfgang Nejdl\n\nIntersection between B*tracks and B*tags\n25\n22.23\n\n%\n\n20\n\n15\n11.89 11.75\n\n11.19\n\n10.35\n10\n\n11.96\n\n8.35\n5.65\n\n5\n\n3.92\n\n2.71\n\n0\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nIntersection Size\n\u2217\nFig. 4: Distribution of intersection size between the optimals blogrolls |BR\n\u2229 BT\u2217 |\n\nHowever, by integrating the social activities of music bloggers and listeners, we\nwere able to overcome this limitation. We have shown the improvement that\nOpen Social Networking can have on the quality of blogrolls: Last.fm offers better optimal blogrolls, than the tracks alone, from Blogger.com, improving the\nquality of the blogroll neighborhoods, in terms of similarity, by 85% when using\ntracks and by 120% percent when integrating tags from the site. The higher\nvalue of similarities computed based on tags can be explained by the fact that\ntags capture some structure of the domain, e.g., genre, increasing the overlap\nprobability and size on the user profiles. Though this do not necessarily mean\nthat tags are better predictor of similarity than tracks, it strongly suggests that\nthe kind of information captured by tags can be exploited effectively, complementing tasks or models where tracks are used alone.\nAlthough our investigation has provided promising results, we believe that our\ncontribution is an initial step in the study of Open Social Networking, future\nwork is required to evaluate the usefulness of optimal blogrolls, e.g., in providing\nrecommendations. Furthermore, we plan to investigate the extent to which the\nexplicit community bonds and \"citizen-defined\" structuring (i.e. blogroll, friends,\nor comment networks) can be described by mining and inferring associations between the profiles of users across social sites, towards a more general model, that\nconsiders new dimensions beyond the ternary relation between users, tags and\nresources.\n\n\fMining User Profiles in OSN\n\n11\n\nAcknowledgements.
