Modelling isotopic abundances or the energy transport\nby photons in a star or a gas, in turn, requires a precise\nknowledge of atomic transition frequencies and oscillator\nstrengths based on atomic structure calculations and experiments with a wide variety of neutral atoms and ions.\nSingly charged calcium ions have been used in various astrophysical observations [3,4]. In particular, monitoring of\nemission and absorption lines of dipole transitions between\nlow-lying states has provided information about systems\nlike galaxies [5,6], interstellar gas clouds [7], gas disks surrounding stars [8,9], and stars [10].\nIn laboratory experiments, cold trapped ions have received considerable attention in optical frequency metrology [11], precision measurements [12,13], and as a physical\nimplementation of quantum information processing [14].\nThe ion species Ca+ is of particular interest in this research, as it has been used for demonstrating important\nexperimental steps in quantum information processing [15,\n16]. It is also studied for use in ion clocks [17,18] and for\nprecision spectroscopy, for instance for the search of possible drifts of physical constants [19,3].\nTheoretical physicists have devoted a considerable effort to improve calculations of matrix elements of transition rates and polarizabilities [20,21,22,23,24] in Ca+ .\nSingly charged calcium is a quasi-hydrogenic system that\n\nconstitutes an interesting model system for testing atomic\nstructure calculations of other singly charged alkali-earth\nions with higher nuclear charge. An improved knowledge\nof their atomic structure would also be of interest for parity non-conversation experiments [12] in Ba+ or Ra+ that\nrequire precise values of transition matrix elements for\na determination of the strength of parity-violating interactions. For a comparison of theoretical predictions with\nexperimental observations, theorists often turn to precision measurements of excited state lifetimes [25,26,28,29,\n30,31]. Alternatively, precise measurements of branching\nfractions [32] of the decay of an excited state into lowerlying states could be used.\nMeasurements of branching ratios or oscillator strengths\nin ions often date back quite a long time [26] and are\nusually performed on ensembles of ions in discharges, ion\nbeams [27] or trapped clouds of ions. A notable exception\nis a recent experiment [33] measuring the branching fractions of the P3/2 state decay with a single trapped Ba+ .\nSingle trapped and laser-cooled ions form an attractive\nsystem to perform such precision measurements, as state\npreparation and quantum state detection can be carried\nout with very high fidelity. In addition, the use of single\nions eliminates errors due to depolarizing collisions.\nFor the precision measurements reported in this paper,\na single Ca+ ion held in a linear Paul trap is employed for\ndetermining the branching fractions of the decay of the excited state 4p 2 P3/2 into the states 4s 2 S1/2 , 3d 2 D5/2 and\n3d 2 D3/2 (Fig. 1). We introduce a novel technique based\non repetitive optical pumping to shuffle populations be-\n\n\f2\n\nR. Gerritsma et al.: Precision measurement of the branching fractions of the 4p 2 P3/2 decay of Ca II\n\nFig. 1. Level scheme of Ca+ showing its five lowest energy\nlevels and the transition wavelength of the electric-dipole (solid\nlines) and electric-quadrupole transitions (dashed lines). The\nmetastable D-states have a lifetime of about 1s. In the experiments, narrow-band laser sources are available to excite all but\nthe transition at 732 nm.\n\ntween two of the lower-lying states. The shuffling steps\nare followed by detection of the population transferred\nto the third state. This technique surpasses the branching ratio measurement of Gallagher [26] by a factor of\nforty in precision and provides branching fractions with\na precision of better than 1%. In combination with precision measurements of the excited P3/2 state lifetime, our\nmeasurements lead to a more precise determination of the\ntransition probabilities on the S1/2 \u2013P3/2 , D3/2 -P3/2 , and\nD5/2 -P3/2 transitions.\n\n2 Measurement method\nA partial level scheme of Ca+ showing its five lowest energy levels is depicted in Fig. 1. The P3/2 state decays\ninto the three states S1/2 , D3/2 , and D5/2 , the D-states\nbeing metastable with a lifetime of about 1.2 s [30,31].\nThe branching fractions pj , i. e. the relative strengths of\nthe decay processes, will be labelled by j, j being the angular momentum quantum number of the state into which\nthe ion decays (j \u2208 { 21 , 23 , 25 }). By definition, pj fulfil the\nnormalization condition p1/2 + p3/2 + p5/2 = 1. In this\nsituation, a branching ratio is conveniently measured by\n(i) preparing the ion in one of the lower states, (ii) optically pumping it via the P3/2 to the other two states, and\n(iii) detecting the state populations in these states [33].\nThis scheme is illustrated by Fig. 2(a). An ion, initially\nin S1/2 , is prepared in D3/2 by optical pumping with light\nat 397 nm (step 1). Then, the state is completely emptied\nby a pulse of light at 850 nm exciting the ion to the P3/2\nstate so that the ion decays into either of the states S1/2\nand D5/2 (step 2). Finally, a quantum state measurement\nreveals the state into which the ion decayed. By repeating this elementary sequence M times and averaging over\nthe measurement outcomes, an estimate r\u0302 of the decay\n\nFig. 2. Scheme for measuring the branching fractions of the\nP3/2 state's decay. (a) To determine the branching ratio r between decay to the S1/2 and D5/2 states, we first shelve the\npopulation in the D3/2 state by a 397 nm laser pulse (step 1).\nNext we empty the population in this state by a pulse of 850 nm\nlight (step 2). After N of these cycles we measure the population in the D5/2 state by fluorescence detection. (b) To measure\nanother branching ratio, we first apply a pulse of 393 nm light,\nto populate the D-manifold via the P3/2 state (step 1). Next\nwe perform N cycles consisting of a pulse of 854 nm light to\nempty the population in the D5/2 (step 2), followed again by\na pulse of 393 nm light (step 1). Again, after N such cycles, a\nfluorescence measurements detects the population in the D5/2\nstate. The combination of measurements (a) and (b) provides\nenough information to unambiguously determine the branching fractions pj .\n\nprobability into D5/2\nr = p5/2 /(p1/2 + p5/2 )\np\nr(1 \u2212 r)/M\nis obtained with a statistical error \u03c3r\u0302 =\nset by quantum projection noise. Note that in this measurement the branching fraction p5/2 is normalized by the\nfactor p1/2 + p5/2 to account for the fact that population decaying back into D3/2 is immediately pumped back\nby the 850 nm laser pulse. In Ca+ , earlier experiments\n[26] had shown that the likelihood of a decay into D5/2\nwas rather small (r \u2248 0.05). For r \u226a 1, the accuracy of\nthe measurement is improved by repeating steps 1 and 2\nmany times before performing the state measurement. In\nthis way, population is shuffled back and forth between\nS1/2 and D3/2 , with a growing fraction accumulating in\nD5/2 . The population in this state after applying N cycles\nis given by\nrN = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 r)N .\n(1)\nResolving\nthis equation for r yields an estimate r\u0302 = 1 \u2212\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 r\u0302N for the decay probability. A short calculation\nshows that the uncertainty of r\u0302 can be expressed as\nN\n\n1 \u2212 r\u0302\n\u03c3r\u0302 (N ) = \u221a\nMN\n\nq\n(1 \u2212 r\u0302)\u2212N \u2212 1,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere it was assumed that the measurement of rN is\nquantum-limited in precision. Minimization of \u03c3r\u0302 as a\nfunction of N results in the optimum number of cycles\n\n\fR.

For the optimum number of measure\u2217\nments N \u2217 , we have rN (N \u2217 ) = 1\u2212e\u2212x \u2248 0.8 and the measurement uncertainty is reduced compared to the singlecycle experiment by\nr\n\u221a\n1\u2212r\n\u03c3r\u0302 (N \u2217 )\n=\u2212\nlog(1 \u2212 r)f (x\u2217 ) \u2248 1.24 r,\n\u03c3r\u0302 (N = 1)\nr\nthe approximation being valid in the case r \u226a 1. For r =\n0.05, the optimum cycle number is given by N \u2217 = 31.\nThe reduction in the number of measurements needed to\nreach a certain level of precision directly translates into a\nreduction of overall measurement time as the duration of\na single experiment is dominated by the time required for\ncooling the ion and measuring its quantum state.\nA second type of experiment detecting another branching ratio is needed for determining the branching fractions\npj . Towards this end, the scheme shown in Fig. 2(b) is employed: An ion in state S1/2 is excited to the P3/2 state\nand subsequently decays into states D3/2 and D5/2 (step\n1). Afterwards, measurement of the D5/2 state population\nreveals the probability\ns = p3/2 /(p5/2 + p3/2 )\nof a decay into D3/2 .\nAgain, the measurement accuracy can be increased by\nshuffling population between the states S1/2 and D5/2 . For\nthis, in a second step, the D5/2 state is emptied by light\nat 854 nm. In this step the probability of decay into D3/2\nis given by\nq = p3/2 /(p1/2 + p3/2 ).\nNow, the measurement prescription is to perform step 1,\nfollowed by N cycles consisting of step 2 and step 1, and\nto measure the D5/2 state population given by\nN\n\nsN = (1 \u2212 s) {(1 \u2212 q)(1 \u2212 s)} .\n\n(4)\n\nP In combination with the normalization condition\nk pk = 1, the two measurements are sufficient for unambiguously determining the branching fractions pj .\n\n3 Setup\nIn the following, a description of the experimental setup\nwill be given. A more detailed account can be found in\nref. [16]. A single 40 Ca+ ion is trapped in a linear Paul\ntrap with trap frequencies of 1.24 MHz and 3 MHz in\nthe axial and radial direction, respectively. The ion is\nDoppler-cooled by light at 397 nm on the S1/2 \u2194 P1/2\ntransition. Light at 866 nm repumps the population lost\nto the D3/2 state back into the cooling cycle. To prevent\ncoherent population trapping in superpositions of Zeeman\n\nFig. 3. Quantum state detection in Ca+ . (a) The ion is excited\nby laser light on the S1/2 \u2194 P1/2 and D3/2 \u2194 P1/2 transitions\nfor a few milliseconds. Fluorescence will be detected if the ion\nis in either the S1/2 or D3/2 state. An ion in the D5/2 state will\nnot fluoresce. To achieve an efficient quantum state detection,\nthe fluorescence detection needs to be short compared to the\nlifetime of the metastable D5/2 state but long enough to provide a clear separation between the photon count distributions\nof the 'dark' and the 'bright' states. (b) Photon count distribution constructed from 105 experiments. In the bright state\nto the right, the ion scatters on average 70 photons detected\nby the photomultiplier within the detection time of 3 ms. In\nthe dark state to the left, on average 1.4 background photons\nare detected due to scattering of laser light from the trap electrodes. From the fit, we infer that the ion was in the D5/2 with\na probability of 0.803(1).\n\nstates, a magnetic field of about 3 G is applied to lift the\ndegeneracy of the Zeeman states.\nCommercially available diode lasers are used for generating narrow-band laser light at wavelengths of 850 nm,\n854 nm and 866 nm. Laser light at 393 nm and 397 nm is\nderived from frequency doubled diode lasers emitting at\n793 nm and 786 nm, respectively. Furthermore, a titanium\nsapphire laser locked to a high finesse cavity and operating at a wavelength of 729 nm is available for coherent\nexcitation of the S1/2 \u2194 D5/2 transition.\nThe fluorescence of the ion emitted on the S1/2 \u2194 P1/2\ntransition is detected on an electron-multiplying CCD camera and a photomultiplier. For quantum state detection,\nthe ion is excited on the S1/2 \u2194 P1/2 transition and the\nfluorescence light is collected on a photo multiplier for 35 ms. An average photon count rate of 23 kcounts/s is\nrecorded when the ion is in either of the 'bright' S1/2 and\nD3/2 states. If the ion is in the 'dark' D5/2 state, an average of 0.5 kcounts/s is detected, caused by scattering of\nthe laser off the trap electrodes. This scheme allows for\na discrimination between the quantum states with nearunit detection efficiency. The detected photon counts per\nmeasurement have a Poissonian distribution around the\naverage value, as shown in Fig. 3. When the ion is in the\nD5/2 -state however, the distribution is slightly modified\ndue to the possibility of spontaneous decay during the\ndetection interval. As a consequence, the Poisson distribution acquires a long tail towards the average value of\ncounts for the S-state. To determine the probability of be-\n\n\f4\n\nR.

The data points are jointly fitted\nwith the measurement results presented in Fig. 5 to obtain the\nbranching fractions pj as described in the main text. The fitted\ncurve is given by eq. (5). The lower plot shows the residuals\nwith errors bars given by the statistical uncertainty due to the\nfinite number of measurements.\n\ning in the bright or dark state at the end of an experiment,\nwe repeat the experiment M times and record the resulting photon counts. Then, a maximum likelihood method\nis used to determine the probability p for the ion of being\nin the dark state. For each single experiment, we compute the probability of observing the detected number of\nphoton counts given p and multiply these probabilities for\nall experiments to obtain an overall probability \u03a0. The\nprobability pD determined by the maximum likelihood estimate then corresponds to the value of p that maximizes\nthe probability \u03a0.\nIn order to discriminate between the S1/2 and the D3/2\nstate, the S1/2 state population is coherently transferred to\nthe D5/2 state prior to state detection by a laser exciting\nthe S1/2 \u2194 D5/2 quadrupole transition. For this, either\nresonant laser \u03c0-pulses or rapid adiabatic passages [34]\nare used connecting pairs of Zeeman states in the ground\nand the metastable state. This way, we achieve a transfer\nprobability of better than 99.5%.\n\n4 Measurement results\nFor the experimental determination of the P3/2 state's\nbranching fractions, a single ion is loaded into the trap.\nThe first experiment implements the scheme depicted in\nFig. 2(a). We start by measuring the time it takes to completely empty the S1/2 state by light at 397 nm. For this, a\nlaser pulse of variable length is applied to an ion prepared\n\nFig. 5. Population in the D5/2 state as a function of the number of cycles N as depicted in Fig. 2(b). The lower plot shows\nthe residuals after fitting the data. The fitted curve is given by\neq. (6).\n\nin state S1/2 , and subsequently the population transferred\nto the D3/2 state is detected by shelving the remaining\nS1/2 state population in the D5/2 level. Fitting an exponentially decaying function to the S1/2 state population,\nwe find a 1/e time of 1 \u03bcs. In a similar measurement, we\ndetermined the decay time of population in D3/2 to be\n16 \u03bcs when emptying the state by light at 850 nm. In a\nnext step, we implement a population shuffling cycle by\nswitching on the laser at 397 nm for 20 \u03bcs before turning\non the laser at 850 nm for a duration of 100 \u03bcs. We repeat\nthis cycle N times to slowly accumulate all the population\nin the D5/2 state. Fig. 4 shows the D5/2 state population\nfor cycle numbers ranging from 5 to 200 by repeating the\nexperiment for each value of N between 20000 and 23000\ntimes. The experimental results are fitted by slightly modifying eq. (1) to\nrN,exp = A(1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 r)N )\n\n(5)\n\nby introducing a scaling factor A to account for the fact\nthat even after 200 pumping cycles the measurement finds\n0.3% of the population to be outside the D5/2 state. This\neffect is caused by the finite lifetime of the metastable\nstates as will be discussed in subsection 5.2.\nA similar procedure is applied for implementing the\nscheme depicted in Fig. 2(b). The 1/e pumping times for\nemptying the states S1/2 and D5/2 by light at 393 nm and\n854 nm are determined to be 2 \u03bcs each. Based on this measurement, a pumping cycle - transferring population from\nD5/2 to S1/2 and back again- was chosen that consisted\nof a laser pulse at 854 nm of 20 \u03bcs duration, followed by\nanother 20 \u03bcs pulse at 393 nm. Again, we measure the\npopulation remaining in the D5/2 state after N pumping\ncycles, N varying between 0 and 69. Fig. 5 shows the experimental results obtained by repeating the experiment\n\n\fR. Gerritsma et al.: Precision measurement of the branching fractions of the 4p 2 P3/2 decay of Ca II\n\n20000 times for each value of N . We fit the results by\nmodifying eq. (4) to\nN\n\nsN,exp = (1 \u2212 s) {(1 \u2212 q)(1 \u2212 s)} + B.\n\n(6)\n\nHere, the offset B accounts for 0.03% of the population\nseemingly remaining in the D5/2 state. The error bars appearing in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 are of statistical nature due\nto the finite number N of experiments.\nThe parameters r, s, q appearing in equations (5) and\n(6) can be expressed by p3/2 and p5/2 . To determine the\nbranching fractions pj , we use a weighted least-square\nfit to jointly fit both decay curves by the set of parameter {p3/2 , p5/2 , A, B}, assuming that the measurement\nerror is given by quantum projection noise. With this\nprocedure, we find p1/2 = 0.9347(3), p3/2 = 0.00661(4),\np5/2 = 0.0587(2), and A = 0.9971(3), B = 0.0013(2). The\nerror bars are obtained from a Monte-Carlo bootstrapping\ntechnique [35]. We randomly vary the experimentally observed D5/2 populations p by shifting their values assuming a Gaussian distribution with variance p(1 \u2212 p)/M and\nfit the resulting data set. Repeating this procedure 1000\ntimes, the spread of the simulated fit parameters provides\nus with an error estimate for the branching fractions.\n\n5 Discussion\n5.1 Statistical errors\nIn the regression analysis used for determining the branching fractions, we assume the errors to be quantum-noise\nlimited. This means that we consider the outcome of an\nindividual experiment to be given by a random variable\nXi , i = 1, . . . , M , yielding the outcome '1' with probability p and the outcome '0' with probability 1 \u2212 p. For a set\nof M experiments, we then assume the standard\ndeviation\np\nPM\n1\nof X = M i=1 Xi to be given by \u03c3p = p(1 \u2212 p)/M . If,\nhowever, due to experimental imperfections the probability p slightly changes over the course of time needed for\ncarrying out the M experiments, this assumption would be\nviolated. We therefore checked the validity of our hypothesis by subdividing our data into K sets Sk , k = 1, . . . , K,\neach containing M/K consecutively taken experiments described by the random variables {Xjk +1 , . . . , Xjk +M/K }.\nFor eachPset Sk , we compute its mean value\nK\n(k)\n\u2212 p from the\np(k) = M\ni\u2208Sk hXi i and its deviation p\naverage probability. We repeat this procedure for different values of K ranging from 2 to 1000. A comparison of\nthe distribution of p(k) \u2212p with the one expected for truly\nrandom variable all having the same probability p leads\nus to conclude that the assumption of quantum-limited\nerrors is well-justified.\n5.2 Systematic errors\nThe method of measuring the branching fractions by repeated optical pumping assumes that the optical pumping\nsteps are perfect. If, however, a small fraction \u01eb1,2 is not\n\n5\n\npumped out in the two pumping steps of the cycle, the\nmeasured decay rates will be smaller than for perfect optical pumping. This systematic effect is taken into account\nby defining an effective cycle number Nef f = N (1\u2212\u01eb1 \u2212\u01eb2 )\nthat replaces the cycle number N in equations (5) and (6).\nThis correction was actually applied in the data evaluation of the first experiment as it turned out that the laser\npulse at 850 nm of 100 \u03bcs duration was too short to completely empty the D3/2 state (\u01eb2 = 0.3% of the population\nwere left behind).\nThe finite lifetime \u03c4D = 1.2 s of the metastable Dstates also has a small effect on the measured branching\nratios. The quantum state detection method we use is not\naffected by spontaneous decay processes occurring during\nthe detection time. Spontaneous decay during the pumping cycle, however, slightly modifies the results. This is\nbest illustrated by the pumping scheme shown in Fig. 2(a).\nSpontaneous decay of the D3/2 state is negligible since the\nstate is emptied by light at 850 nm in 16\u03bcs, i.e. with a rate\nroughly 104 times bigger than the spontaneous decay rate.\nThe situation is different for the D5/2 state which is pop\u22121\nulated by a rate Ra = r\u03c4cycle\nwhere \u03c4cycle = 120 \u03bcs is\nthe duration of a single pumping cycle. Here, spontaneous\ndecay gives rise to a steady-state D5/2 state population\npD,\u221e = 1 \u2212 Ra \u03c4D \u2248 99.8% in the limit of an infinite number of pumping cycles which is consistent with the measured value of the fit multiplier A. In addition to changing\nthe steady state solution, the additional decay process also\ndecreases the time required for reaching the equilibrium\n(see eq. (5)). This effect was taken into account in the\nanalysis of the branching fractions stated in Tab. 1.\nA similar argument can be made for spontaneous decay\naffecting the pumping scheme of Fig. 2(b). Here, the D3/2\n\u22121\nis populated with a rate Rb \u2248 s\u03c4cycle\nwhich needs to be\ncompared to the spontaneous decay rate 1/\u03c4D . Due to this\neffect, we expect to find a steady-state population of about\n0.04% that is not in D3/2 . Here, the effect is smaller since\nr < s and the duration of the pumping cycle was about five\ntime shorter than in the other experiment. The correction\nto the measured rate is also about 0.04% and does not\nsignificantly alter our measurement. Before performing the\nbranching ratio measurements, we had checked that the\nlifetimes of the metastable states were not significantly\nshortened by the lasers at 850 and 854 nm which could\noccur either by a broad-band frequency background of the\ndiode lasers producing the light or by imperfectly switched\noff laser beams.\nIn general, any additional mechanism that leads to\nan exchange of population between the atomic states will\nmodify the steady-state population obtained in the limit\nof large N and shorten the time scale required for reaching the steady-state. Spin-changing collisions leading to\ntransitions between the D3/2 and the D5/2 state are of no\nimportance in our measurements as they occur at a rate\nthat is smaller than 10\u22122 s\u22121 .\n\n\f6\n\nR.

By evaluating\nthe ratio\nP\np3/2 /(p1/2 + p5/2 ), we find A(P3/2 \u2212S1/2 )/ J A(P3/2 \u2212DJ ) =\n14.31(5) for the branching ratio of the decay into the Sand D-states. This is a bit lower than the value of 17.6(2.0)\nmeasured by Gallagher [26] in a discharge experiment in\n1967. A comparison with theoretical calculations [20,21,\n22,23] is given in Tab. 1, showing a good agreement between experiment and theory.\nWhen combining the branching ratio measurements\nwith an experimental determination [29] of the P3/2 state's\nlifetime, the relative decay strengths can be converted into\nEinstein A coefficients which are also given in Tab. 1. We\nalso list the theoretical predictions of ref. [23] which are\nall about 4% higher, a discrepancy much bigger than for\nthe relative decay strengths. From this point of view, it\nmight be of interest to use a single trapped ion for a measurement of its excited state lifetime [36] or its absolute\noscillator strengths.\n\nA measurement of the pumping rate could be performed\nin a similar way as the experiments presented in this paper\nby shelving the S1/2 population in D5/2 prior to quantum\nstate detection. For the determination of the light shift \u03b4ac ,\na spin echo experiment could be performed on the S1/2 \u2194\nD5/2 transition, measuring the shift of the transition frequency by the light pumping the ion. Measurements of\nthis type have recently been shown [37] to be able to resolve level shifts as small as 1 Hz. To give an example, we\nassume \u2206 = (2\u03c0) 1010 s\u22121 and adjust the Rabi frequency\nto get R = 102 s\u22121 . Because of A(P1/2 \u2212 D3/2 ) \u2248 107 s\u22121 ,\nthe light shift will be \u03b4ac = (2\u03c0) 105 s\u22121 . To measure the\nEinstein coefficient to better than 1% would require a measurement of the light shift with a precision of better than\n1 kHz within a measurement time somewhat shorter than\n1/R = 10 ms which appears to be feasible.\nFor a proper treatment, the Zeeman sublevels of the\natomic levels need to be taken into account. Fortunately,\nin the case of the S1/2 \u2194 P1/2 transition, the pumping\nrate and the induced light shift are independent of the\npolarization of the exciting laser as long as it is linearly\npolarized. In this way, the Einstein coefficient could be independently measured with high precision to complement\nthe branching ratio measurements presented in this paper.\n\n5.4 Measuring Einstein coefficients in a single ion\nA large variety of methods exists for measuring transition matrix elements in ensembles of neutral atoms or ions\n[32]. In view of the discrepancy between the Einstein coefficients calculated from experimental observations and\npredicted by theory, we would like to propose yet another\ntechnique capable of directly measuring Einstein coefficients in a single ion. We will discuss the technique for the\ncase of the decay rate of the P1/2 \u2194 D3/2 transition.\nWe start with an ion initially prepared in the S1/2\nstate. A narrow-band laser off-resonantly exciting the\nS1/2 \u2194 P1/2 transition pumps the ion into the D3/2 state.\nIf the detuning \u2206 of the laser is much bigger than the\ninverse of the excited state lifetime, the pumping rate is\ngiven by R = A(P1/2 \u2212D3/2 ) \u03c1 P1/2 where \u03c1 P1/2 = \u03a9 2 /(4\u22062 )\nis the excited state population and \u03a9 the Rabi frequency\nof the laser exciting the transition. The Rabi frequency is\nrelated to the ac-Stark shift \u03b4ac = \u03a9 2 /(4|\u2206|) experienced\nby the S1/2 state due to the presence of the off-resonant\nlight. In this way, the Einstein coefficient can by expressed\n\nA(P1/2 \u2212D3/2 ) = R\n\n\u2206\n.\n\u03b4ac\n\n5.5 Conclusion\nOur experiments demonstrate that single trapped ions are\nperfectly suited for a precision measurement of branching\nfractions. As compared to experiments based on a single\npumping step, the technique of repeated optical pumping\noffers two important advantages. Firstly, it reduces the\nnumber of measurements required for obtaining a given\nlevel of accuracy in the case where the transition probabilities to the lower-lying states are very different. Secondly, monitoring the population transfer as a function\nof the number of the pumping cycle provides a means to\ndetect possible sources of errors like atomic state changes\ninduced by sources other than the lasers used for optical\npumping.\nThe pumping technique used in this paper requires an\natom with a tripod level structure, i. e. an upper state decaying into three lower-lying states. As this level structure\n\n\fR.
