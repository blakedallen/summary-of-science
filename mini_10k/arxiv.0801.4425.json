The function \u03b6 is as well regular and it\ntakes real values. We say that the equation is singular because \u03b6(U ) can attain the value 0.\nEquation (1.1) is related to a class of problems studied in singular perturbation theory. Consider system\n\u001a\n\u03b5dx/dt = f (x, y, \u03b5)\n(1.2)\ndy/dt = g(x, y, \u03b5),\nwhere x and y are vector valued functions, \u03b5 is a parameter. In singular perturbation theory one is typically\nconcerned with the limit \u03b5 \u2192 0 and with the corresponding behaviour of the solution (x, y). Note that (1.1)\n1\n\n\fcan be viewed as as an extension of (1.2), in the sense that (1.2) can be written in the form (1.1): in this\ncase, the singularity \u03b6(U ) in (1.1) is identically equal to \u03b5 and hence d\u03b6/dt = 0.\nBeing the literature concerning (1.2) extremely wide, it would be difficult to give an overview here.\nConsequently, we just refer to the notes by Jones [11] and to the rich bibliography contained therein. In\nparticular, [11] provides a nice overview of Fenichel's papers [10, 8, 9]. The works [10, 8, 9] provide several\nideas and techniques exploited in the present paper.\nThe main novelty of the present work is that we consider the case \u03b6 is a nontrivial function of the unknown\nU . In particular,\nthis means\nthat d\u03b6/dt 6= 0 in general and hence that we have to face the possibility that\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03b6 U (0) 6= 0, but \u03b6 U (t) = 0 for a finite value of t. This is exactly what happens in the examples (2.14)\nand (2.19) discussed in Section 2 here. Other examples are provided in a previous work by the same authors\u0001\n[5], Section 2. Note that, in all\n\b these cases, there \u0001is a loss of regularity at the time t0 at which \u03b6 (U (t)\nreaches the value 0, t0 = min t \u2208 [0, +\u221e[: \u03b6 U (t) = 0 . More precisely, the first derivative dU/dt either\nhas a discontinuity or blows up at t = t0 .\nOur goal here is to study the solutions of (1.1) that lie in a neighborhood of a point \u016a such that\n\u03c6s (\u016a ) = \u03c6ns (\u016a ) = ~0 and \u03b6(\u016a ) = 0. We are concerned with the existence of invariant manifolds. More\nprecisely, the problem is the following.\nConsider first the case of the non singular ODE\ndU\n= f (U )\ndt\n\n(1.3)\n\nand assume that the point \u016a is an equilibrium, namely f (\u016a ) = ~0. In a neighbourhood of \u016a one can define a\ncenter and a center stable manifold, which are both locally invariant for (1.3). We recall here that, loosely\nspeaking, a center stable manifold contains the orbits of (1.3) that as x \u2192 +\u221e either do not blow up or\nblow up more slowly than e\u03b7t , where \u03b7 is a small enough constant depending on the system. More precisely,\nthe orbits that lie on a center stable manifold are those having the asymptotic behaviour described before\nand solving a suitable system which, in a small neighbourhood of \u016a , coincides with the original one (1.3).\nAlso, assume that there exists a manifold E entirely constituted by equilibria of (1.3) and containing\n\u016a . We are interested in the uniformly stable manifold relative to E. By uniformly stable manifold we\nmean the slaving manifold that contains all the orbits that when t \u2192 +\u221e decay with exponential speed to\nsome point in E. Note that the uniformly stable manifold does not coincide, in general, with the classical\nstable manifold. Indeed, the stable manifold contains the orbits that decay exponentially fast to the given\nequilibrium \u016a , while on the uniformly stable manifold we only require that the limit belongs to E.\nThe existence of a center stable and of the uniformly stable manifold can be obtained as consequence of\nthe Hadamard-Perron Theorem, which is discussed for example in the book by Katok and Hasselblatt [13].\nIn the present paper we prove that, under suitable hypotheses, one can extend the definition of center,\ncenter stable and of uniformly stable manifold from the case of the non singular ODE (1.3) to the singular\ncase (1.1). The manifolds we define are all locally invariant for (1.1) and satisfy the following property:\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(P) If U is an orbit lying on the manifold and \u03b6 U (0) 6= 0, then \u03b6 U (t) 6= 0 for every t.\nThis, in particular, rules out the losses of regularity (blow up or discontinuity in the first derivative) mentioned\nbefore.\nWe proceed as follows. First, we consider the non singular ODE\ndU\n= \u03c6s (U ) + \u03b6(U )\u03c6ns (U ).\nd\u03c4\n\n(1.4)\n\nFormally, (1.4) is obtained from (1.1) via the change of variable \u03c4 = \u03c4 (t), defined as the solution of the\nCauchy problem\n\uf8f1\nd\u03c4\n1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n=\n\uf8f2\ndt\n\u03b6[U (t)]\n(1.5)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u03c4 (0) = 0.\n2\n\n\fHowever, the function \u03c4 (t) is well defined only if \u03b6[U (t)] 6= 0 for every t. In the work we always refer to the\nformulation (1.4) and we prove the existence of locally invariant manifolds satisfying property (P). We then\nshow that a posteriori the change of variable (1.5) is well defined and system (1.4) is equivalent to (1.1) on\nthese manifolds.\nWe assume that\n1. For every Mc center manifold of (1.4), the intersection between the set {U : \u03b6(U ) = 0} and Mc\ncontains only equilibria.\nWe then define a manifold of slow dynamics as a center manifold of (1.4) (any center manifold works). To\nsimplify the exposition, in the following we fix a manifold of slow dynamics. To define the manifold of fast\ndynamics we assume\n2. there exists a one-dimensional manifold which is transversal to the set {U : \u03b6(U ) = 0} and is entirely\nconstituted by equilibria of (1.4). In the following, we denote by E this manifold.\nThe manifold of fast dynamics is then defined as the uniformly stable manifold of (1.1) relative to the\nmanifold of equilibria E. Namely, all the fast dynamics converge exponentially fast to some equilibrium in\nE.\nThe manifolds of slow and fast dynamics can be regarded as extensions to the general case of the notions\nof slow and fast time scale discussed for example in Fenichel [10] in relation to system (1.2), namely to the\ncase \u03b6 is a parameter.\nWe also assume that\n3. The singular set {\u03b6(U ) = 0} is invariant for both (1.4) and for the solutions of (1.1) that lie on the\nmanifold of the slow dynamics.\nIt is not hard to show that, as a consequence of the previous assumptions, if we restrict system (1.4) on\nthe manifold of slow dynamics, then (1.4) is equivalent to (1.1). We can thus go back to the original variable\nt and get that the solutions of (1.1) lying on the manifold of the slow dynamics satisfy a non singular ODE.\nWe then define a center manifold of (1.1) as a center manifold of the system reduced on the manifold of slow\ndynamics (Theorem 4.1). In this way property (P) is automatically satisfied on any center manifold and the\nlosses of regularity are ruled out. As before, by loss of regularity we mean the blows up or discontinuities\nin the first derivative that may be exhibited by the solutions of (1.1), as shown by the examples (2.14) and\n(2.19) in Section 2 here.\nTo extend to the case of the singular ODE (1.1) the definition of center stable and uniformly stable\nmanifold we need some more work. As mentioned before, thanks to assumption 2, there exists a manifold of\nequilibria transversal to the singular surface: we denoted this manifold by E. To define the uniformly stable\nmanifold of (1.1) relative to E we need to study the solutions of (1.1) which converges to an equilibrium\non E with exponential speed. Note that this speed can be either bounded or unbounded as \u03b6 \u2192 0, so\nwe are looking for a composition of both fast and slow dynamics. Also, to define a center stable manifold\nloosely speaking we have to study orbits that are local solutions of (1.1) and that do not blow too fast when\nt \u2192 +\u221e. Therefore, we have to deal again with a composition of slow and fast dynamics.\nIn both cases (uniformly stable and center stable manifold) the analysis can be seen as an extension of\nthe exponential splitting methods for non singular ODEs like (1.3). However, as mentioned before what a\npriori can go wrong is that in the change of time scale defined by the Cauchy problem\n\uf8f1\n1\nd\u03c4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n=\n\uf8f2\ndt\n\u03b6[U (t)]\n(1.6)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u03c4 (0) = 0.\n\nsome regularity is missing.\nThe main result of this paper is the following (a more precise statement is given in Theorem 4.2):\n\n3\n\n\fTheorem 1.1. There is a sufficiently small constant \u03b4 > 0 such that the following holds. In the ball of\ncenter \u016a and of radius \u03b4 in RN one can define two continuously differentiable manifolds Ms and Mcs which\nare both locally invariant for (1.1). The first one, Ms , is the uniformly stable manifold of\n\u0001 (1.1) relative\nto E, while Mcs is a center stable manifold for (1.1). If U is a solution satisfying \u03b6 U (0) 6= 0 and lying\non either Ms or Mcs , the Cauchy problem (1.6) defines a diffeomorphism \u03c4 : [0, +\u221e[\u2192 [0, +\u221e[. In other\nwords, if we\u0001 restrict to either Ms or Mcs , then the formulations (1.1) and (1.4) are equivalent, provided\nthat \u03b6 U (0) 6= 0. In particular, property (P) is satisfied on both Ms and Mcs .\nAlso, if U (\u03c4 ) is a solution lying on either Ms or Mcs , then it can be decomposed as\nU (\u03c4 ) = Uf (\u03c4 ) + Usl (\u03c4 ) + Up (\u03c4 ),\n\n(1.7)\n\nwhere Usl lies on the manifold of slow dynamics and Uf (\u03c4 ) is exponentially decreasing to ~0. The perturbation\nterm Up (\u03c4 ) is small in the sense that\n\u0001\n|U p (\u03c4 )| \u2264 kp \u03b6 U (0) Uf (0) e\u2212c\u03c4 /4\n\nfor suitable positive constants c, kp > 0.\n\nFrom the technical point of view, the key points in the proof of Theorem (1.1) are the following two.\nFirst, we introduce a change of variables which allows us to write system\ndU\n= \u03c6s (U ) + \u03b6(U )\u03c6ns (U ).\nd\u03c4\n\n(1.8)\n\nin a more convenient form. The precise statement is given in Proposition 4.1. This change of variables\nexploits many of the ideas which in the case of equation (1.2) lead to the introduction of the so called\nFenichel Normal Form (see Jones [11] and the references therein) . Here, however, we have to rely on the\nassumptions 1, 2 and 3 discussed above.\nThe second main point in the proof of Theorem 1.1 is the analysis of a family of slaving manifolds for\nsystem (1.8). This analysis exploits the presence of a splitting based on exponential decay estimates and\nit is in the spirit of Hadamard Perron Theorem (see for example the book by Katok and Hasselblatt [13]).\nHere the main results are Theorem 3.1 and Proposition 3.1. Loosely speaking, Proposition 3.1 tells us the\nfollowing. Fix a manifold S, locally invariant for (1.8) and entirely made by slow dynamics. Then there\nexists a slaving manifold containing orbits that decay to an orbit in S exponentially fast, with respect to\nthe \u03c4 variable. Also, Proposition 3.1 ensures that any solution U lying on the slaving manifold admits a\ndecomposition like (1.7), namely\nU (\u03c4 ) = Uf (\u03c4 ) + Usl (\u03c4 ) + Up (\u03c4 )\nwhere Usl lies on S and Uf (\u03c4 ) is exponentially decreasing to ~0. The perturbation term Up (\u03c4 ) is small\nand disappears when \u03b6(U ) = 0, so on the singular surface {U : \u03b6(U ) = 0} there is no interaction, but\na complete decoupling. Actually, in the statement of Proposition 3.1 we consider slightly more general\nconditions ensuring that the interaction term disappears. However, the case \u03b6(U ) = 0 is the one we exploit\nin the following. From the technical point of view, the most complicated point in the analysis is proof of the\nC 1 regularity of the slaving manifold, since it involves studying the Frech\u00e9t differentiability of suitable maps\nbetween Banach spaces.\n\nAn application of our analysis concerns the study of the viscous profiles with small total variation for a\nclass of mixed hyperbolic-parabolic systems in one space dimension. The connection between these viscous\nprofiles and the singular ordinary differential equation (1.1) is discussed in [6], where we also explain what we\nmean by viscous profiles and by mixed hyperbolic-parabolic systems in this context. In [6] we also discuss a\nremark due to Fr\u00e9deric Rousset [14] about the Lagrangian and the Eulerian formulation of the Navier Stokes\nequation. Loosely speaking, the connection between viscous profiles and singular ODEs like (1.1) is that the\nequation satisfied by the viscous profiles may be singular when the system does not satisfy a condition of\nblock linear degeneracy defined in [5]. In particular, this happens in the case of the Navier Stokes equation\n4\n\n\fwritten in Eulerian coordinates. As we see in Section 2.1.1, the analysis developed in the present paper\napplies to the study of the viscous profiles of the Navier Stokes.\nViscous profiles provide useful information when studying the parabolic approximation of an hyperbolic\nconservation law. If one restricts to systems with small enough total variation, it is often meaningful to\nfocus on viscous profiles lying on a center, a center stable or on the uniformly stable manifold. The literature\nconcerning these topics is extremely wide. Here, we just refer to the books by Dafermos [7] and by Serre\n[16] and to the rich bibliography contained therein for a discussion about the parabolic approximation of\nconservation laws. For the applications of the viscous profiles to the study of this approximation, see for\nexample Bianchini and Bressan [4] and Ancona and Bianchini [2]. Concerning the analysis of viscous profiles,\nwe only refer to Benzoni-Gavage, Rousset, Serre and Zumbrun [3], to Zumbrun [18], and to the references\ntherein. For an alternative approach to the analysis of the viscous profiles of the compressible Navier Stokes\nequation, see Wagner [17] and the references therein.\n\nThe exposition is organized as follows. In Section 1.1 we discuss a toy model and we introduce the results\nthat are extended in the following sections to the general case.\nIn Section 2 we define our hypotheses and in Section 2.1.1 we show that they are satisfied by the viscous\nprofiles of the compressible Navier Stokes equation. Also, in Section 2.2 we discuss two examples: each of\nthem show that, if one different hypothesis is not satisfied, then the first derivative dU/dt of a solution U of\n(1.1) may blow up in finite time.\nIn Section 3 we define a class of invariant manifolds for an equation with no singularity in it (Theorem 3.1\nand Proposition 3.1). This analysis is applied in Section 4 to study the singular ODE (1.1). In particular, in\nSection 4.1 we define the notions of slow and fast dynamic and we extend the definition of center manifold to\nthe case of the singular ODE (1.1). In Section 4.2 we discuss how to extend the notions of uniformly stable\nand center stable manifold: the main result here is Theorem 4.2. Finally, Section 4.3 is devoted to the proof\nof Proposition 4.1, a technical result which reduces our system to a more convenient form.\n\n1.1\n\nA toy model\n\nIn this section we discuss a toy model for system (1.1). The goal is introducing in a simplified context the\nanalysis that is extended in Section 4 to the general case. All the conditions introduced in Section 2 are\nsatisfied by the toy model discussed here, except for Hypothesis 2. Hypothesis 2 is a technical condition and\nprescribes that the functions \u03c6s and \u03c6ns in (1.1) satisfy the following: \u03c6s (U ) + \u03b6(U )\u03c6ns (U ) is identically ~0\nwhen U is out of a small enough neighbourhood of the origin.\nActually, our toy model can be handled with known geometric singular perturbation theory techniques.\nIndeed, in the present section we assume that the function \u03b6 in (1.1) is just a parameter, namely\nd\u03b6\n= 0.\ndt\n\n(1.9)\n\nAlso, we focus on the case of a linear system:\n1\ndV\n= As V + Ans V\ndt\n\u03b6\n\nV \u2208 Rd .\n\n(1.10)\n\nIn the following we consider only non negative values of t and we focus on the limit \u03b6 \u2192 0+ . The study of\nthe limit \u03b6 \u2192 0\u2212 does not involve additional difficulties.\nConsider the system\ndV\n= As V + \u03b6Ans V\nV \u2208 Rd ,\n(1.11)\nd\u03c4\nwhich is obtained from (1.10) via the change of variable \u03c4 = t \u03b6. In the following, we denote by n\u2212 the number\nof eigenvalues of As having strictly negative real part (each of them counted according to its multiplicity)\nand by n+ the number of eigenvalues with strictly positive real part. We denote by n0 the multiplicity of the\neigenvalue 0 and, relying on Assumption 1 in the introduction, we assume that there are no purely imaginary\n5\n\n\feigenvalues. Also, if we write the Jordan form of As , then in the block corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 all\nthe entries are 0.\nLet \u03b6 \u2192 0+ : we are concerned with the behavior of the eigenvalues of the matrix As + \u03b6Ans . Thanks to\nresults concerning the perturbation of finite-dimensional linear operators (see for example the book by Kato\n[12], page 64 and followings), these eigenvalues can be classified as follows:\n1. n\u2212 eigenvalues converge to the eigenvalues of As with strictly negative real part. We denote by M \u2212 (\u03b6)\nthe eigenspace of As + \u03b6Ans associated to these eigenvalues.\n2. n+ eigenvalues converge to the eigenvalues of As with strictly positive real part. We denote by M + (\u03b6)\nthe eigenspace of As + \u03b6Ans associated to these eigenvalues.\n3. the remaining n0 eigenvalues converge to 0 as \u03b6 \u2192 0+ . We denote by M 0 (\u03b6) the eigenspace of As +\u03b6Ans\nassociated to these eigenvalues.\nWhen \u03b6 \u2192 0+ , the subspace M \u2212 (\u03b6) converges to M \u2212 (0), which is the eigenspace of As associated to\neigenvalues with strictly negative real part. The convergence occurs in the following sense: M \u2212 (\u03b6) is the\nrange of a linear application P \u2212 (\u03b6) \u2208 L(Rd , Rd ). As \u03b6 \u2192 0+ , P \u2212 (\u03b6) converges to P \u2212 (0) and the range of\nP \u2212 (0) is exactly M \u2212 (0). Similarly, when \u03b6 \u2192 0+ , the subspaces M + (\u03b6) and M 0 (\u03b6) converge respectively to\nM + (0) and M 0 (0), the eigenspaces of As associated to the eigenvalues with strictly positive and zero real\npart. We refer again to Kato [12] for a complete discussion.\nIf V belongs to M \u2212 (\u03b6), then (1.11) is equivalent to\nh\ni\ndV \u2212\n= A\u2212\n+\n\u03b6\nO(1)\nV \u2212,\ns\nd\u03c4\n\nwhere V \u2212 \u2208 Rn\u2212 and A\u2212\ns is a n\u2212 \u00d7n\u2212 -dimensional matrix which does not depend on \u03b6 and whose eigenvalues\nhave all strictly negative real part. In the previous equation, the entries of the vector V \u2212 are the coordinates\nof u with respect to a basis of M \u2212 (\u03b6) and O(1) denotes a n\u2212 \u00d7 n\u2212 -dimensional matrix which possibly\ndepends on \u03b6 but remains bounded as \u03b6 \u2192 0+ . Its exact expression\u0002 is not important\nhere.\n\u0003\nIf \u03b6 is sufficiently small, then all the eigenvalues of the matrix As + \u03b6O(1) have strictly negative real\npart and hence the solution V \u2212 (\u03c4 ) converges exponentially fast to ~0. More precisely, one has\n|V \u2212 (\u03c4 )| \u2264 e\u2212c\u03c4 /2|V \u2212 (0)|,\nwhere c > 0 satisfies \u2212c > \u03bb for every \u03bb eigenvalue of As . Coming back to the original variable t, V \u2212 satisfies\n|V \u2212 (t)| \u2264 e\u2212ct/2\u03b6 |V \u2212 (0)|.\n\nand hence the speed of exponential decay gets faster and faster as \u03b6 \u2192 0+ . In this sense, we can regard V \u2212\nas a fast dynamic.\nConversely, assume that V \u2208 M 0 (\u03b6), then (1.11) is equivalent to\nh\ni\ndV 0\n= \u03b6 L0 Ans R0 + \u03b6O(1) V 0 ,\nd\u03c4\n\nwhere R0 and L0 are two matrices that do not depend on \u03b6. The matrix R0 has dimension N \u00d7 n0 and\nits columns constitute a basis of M 0 (0). The matrix L0 is n0 \u00d7 N -dimensional and satisfies L0 R0 = In0 .\nAlso, V 0 = L0 V and O(1) denotes an n0 \u00d7 n0 -dimensional matrix, which possibly depends on \u03b6 but remains\nbounded as \u03b6 \u2192 0+ . Its exact expression is not relevant here. Coming back to the original variable t, one\ngets\nh\ni\ndV 0\n= L0 Ans R0 + \u03b6O(1) V 0 ,\n(1.12)\ndt\nand hence V 0 can be regarded as a slow dynamic, because it satisfies the non singular ODE (1.12).\nApplying the same techniques mentioned before, one gets that the eigenvalues of L0 Ans R0 + \u03b6O(1) can\nbe divided into 3 groups:\n6\n\n\f1. eigenvalues that converge to the eigenvalues of L0 Ans R0 with strictly negative real part. We denote\nby M 0\u2212 (\u03b6) the corresponding eigenspace.\n2. eigenvalues that converge to the eigenvalues of L0 Ans R0 with strictly positive real part. We denote by\nM 0+ (\u03b6) the corresponding eigenspace.\n3. eigenvalues that converge to the eigenvalues of L0 Ans R0 with zero part. We denote by M 00 (\u03b6) the\ncorresponding eigenspace.\nIf V (t) \u2208 M 0\u2212 (\u03b6), then V (t) converges exponentially fast to the equilibrium ~0 when t \u2192 +\u221e, but the speed\nof exponential decay does not blow up as \u03b6 \u2192 0+ .\nThe space\nM s (\u03b6) = M \u2212 (\u03b6) \u2295 M 0\u2212 (\u03b6)\n(1.13)\ncan be regarded as uniformly stable space for (1.10), because every orbit entirely contained in this space\ndecays exponentially fast to ~0. Also, the speed of exponential decay is uniformly bounded from below by a\nconstant which does not depend on \u03b6. Another way of interpreting this observation is the following: combine\nequations (1.9) and (1.10) and consider in Rd+1 the system\n\u001a\nd\u03b6/dt = 0\n(1.14)\ndV /dt = As V /\u03b6 + Ans V.\nEvery point in the subspace {(\u03b6, ~0)} is then an equilibrium for (1.14). Also, for any \u03b6\u0304, every orbit V (t)\nlying on M (\u03b6\u0304) converges to the equilibrium (\u03b6\u0304, ~0), and the speed of exponential decay is bounded below by\na constant independent of \u03b6\u0304.\nConversely, the space M 00 (\u03b6) can be regarded as a center manifold of the original equation (1.10).\nIn Section 4 we will extend the previous considerations to the case of the non linear equation\ndU\n1\n=\n\u03c6s (U ) + \u03c6ns (U ),\ndt\n\u03b6(U )\nwhere \u03b6(U ) is in general a non constant function.\n\n2\n\nHypotheses\n\nIn this section we discuss the hypotheses assumed in the work.\nMore precisely, in Section 2.1 we state the conditions imposed on the singular ODE\n1\ndU\n=\n\u03c6s (U ) + \u03c6ns (U ).\ndt\n\u03b6(U )\n\n(2.1)\n\nThese conditions can be divided into two groups: Hypotheses 1, 2, 3, allow to avoid some technical complications, but could be actually omitted at the price of much heavier notations. On the other side, Hypotheses\n4, 5, 6, 7, 8 are much more important and they will be deeply exploited in Section 4. Note, however, that in\nSection 3 we are not directly concerned with the singular ODE (2.1) and that we do not exploit Hypotheses\n4, 5, 6, 7, 8.\nMoreover, in Section 2.2 we discuss three counterexamples. They show that, if either Hypothesis 7 or\nHypothesis 8 is violated, then the results discussed in the following sections do not hold. In particular, there\nmight be solutions of (2.1) that are not continuously differentiable.\nFinally, in Section 2.1.1 we verify that the conditions introduced in Section 2.1 are satisfied by the viscous\nprofiles of the compressible Navier Stokes equation written in Eulerian coordinates.\n\n7\n\n\f2.1\n\nHypotheses satisfied by the singular O.D.E\n\nDefine\nF (U ) = \u03c6s (U ) + \u03b6(U )\u03c6ns (U )\n\n(2.2)\n\nand consider the non singular ordinary differential equation\ndU\n= F (U )\nd\u03c4\n\nU \u2208 RN .\n\n(2.3)\n\nFormally, (2.3) is obtained from (2.1) via the change of variables \u03c4 = \u03c4 (t) defined as the solution of the\nCauchy problem\n\uf8f1\n1\nd\u03c4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n=\n\uf8f2\ndt\n\u03b6[U (t)]\n(2.4)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u03c4 (0) = 0.\n\nHowever, the function \u03c4 (t) is well defined only if \u03b6[U (t)] 6= 0 for every t. To overcome this difficulty we\nthen proceed as follows: we state all the hypotheses referring to the formulation (2.3). Relying on these\nhypotheses, in Section 4 we prove the existence of various locally invariant manifolds for (2.3) satisfying the\nfollowing property. If U is an orbit lying on one of these manifolds and \u03b6[U (0)] 6= 0, then \u03b6[U (t)] 6= 0 for\nevery t. If we restrict to the orbits lying on these manifolds, (2.3) is equivalent to (2.1).\nTo simplify the exposition, we assume the following:\n\u0001\nHypothesis 1. The initial datum U (0) of (2.3) satisfies \u03b6 U (0) > 0.\n\u0001\n\u0001\nThe case \u03b6 U (0) < 0 does not involve additional difficulties. The main difference is that, if \u03b6 U (0) < 0,\nthen the change of variable defined by (2.4) has negative derivative. As a consequence, when t \u2192 +\u221e the\nfunction \u03c4 (t)\u0001 \u2192 \u2212\u221e. Loosely speaking, the statements given in the present paper can be extended to the\ncase \u03b6 U (0) < 0 in the following way. All the statements concerning the fast dynamics and referring to the\nstable space or to stable-like manifolds have to be replaced by analogous statements\n\u0001 concerning the unstable\nspace or unstable-like manifolds. However, we will not consider the case \u03b6 U (0) < 0 explicitly.\nBefore stating the other hypotheses, we recall that we want to study (2.1) and (2.3) in the neighbourhood\nof an equilibrium point \u016a such that F (\u016a ) = ~0 and \u03b6(\u016a ) = 0. It is not restrictive to take \u016a = ~0. Namely, in\nthe following we assume\nF (~0) = ~0\n\u03b6(~0) = 0.\n(2.5)\nAlso, we can assume the following. Fix a positive constant \u03b4 > 0 and consider a smooth cut-off function\n\u03c1(U ) satisfying\n\u001a\nU |U | \u2264 \u03b4\n\u03c1(U ) =\n0 |U | \u2265 2\u03b4.\nIn the following, instead of studying system (2.3) we focus on\ndU\n= \u03c1(U )F (U ).\nd\u03c4\nHowever, to simplify the notations instead of writing each time \u03c1(U )F (U ) we assume that Hypothesis 2\nholds.\nHypothesis 2. The function F satisfies the following condition: if |U | \u2265 2\u03b4 then F (U ) = ~0.\nThe exact size of the constant \u03b4 will be discussed in the following.\nNote that Hypothesis 2 is not restrictive if the goal is to study the solutions of (2.3) that remain confined\nin a neighbourhood of the origin of size \u03b4. Loosely speaking, the analysis developed in Sections 3 and 4 can be\nextended to the orbits of systems that violate Hypothesis 2 as far as these orbits remain in a neighbourhood\nof the origin with size \u03b4. In particular, the manifold described in Sections 3 and 4 are no more invariant if\nHypothesis 2 is violated: they are just locally invariant.\n8\n\n\fWe also introduce the following simplification. It is not restrictive to assume that all the eigenvalues of\nDF (~0) have non positive real part. Indeed, this condition is satisfied if we restrict to a center-stable manifold\nfor (2.3). As mentioned in the introduction, the existence of a center stable manifold can be obtained as a\nconsequence of the Hadamard Perron theorem, which is discussed\u0001 for example in the book by Katok and\nHasselblatt [13] (Chapter 6, page 242). Also, note that if \u03b6 U (0) < 0 then it is not restrictive to assume\nthat all the eigenvalues of DF (~0) have non negative real part: this can be obtained considering the solutions\nthat lie on a center unstable manifold.\nHypothesis 3. The Jacobian DF (~0) admits only eigenvalues with non positive real part.\nAlso, we assume the following non degeneracy condition:\nHypothesis 4. The gradient \u2207\u03b6(~0) 6= ~0.\nLet S be the singular set\n\b\nS := U : \u03b6(U ) = 0 .\n\n(2.6)\n\nThanks to the implicit function theorem, Hypothesis 4 ensures that in a small enough neighbourhood of ~0\nthe set S is actually a manifold of dimension N \u2212 1, where N is the dimension of U .\nHypothesis 5. Let Mc be any center manifold for (2.3) around the equilibrium point ~0. If |U | \u2264 \u03b4 and U\nbelongs to the intersection Mc \u2229 S , then U is an equilibrium for (2.3), namely F (U ) = ~0 .\nConcerning equilibria, we also assume the following\nHypothesis 6. There exists a manifold of equilibria Meq for (2.3) which contains ~0 and which is transversal\nto S.\nLet neq be the dimension of Meq . We recall that the manifolds S and Meq are transversal if the\nintersection S \u2229 Meq is a manifold with dimension neq \u2212 1 (as pointed out before, the dimension of S is\nN \u2212 1).\nHypothesis 7. For every U \u2208 S,\n\u2207\u03b6(U ) * F (U ) = 0.\n\n(2.7)\n\nThanks to Hypothesis 7 and to the regularity of the functions \u03b6 and F , the function\nG(U ) =\n\n\u2207\u03b6(U ) * F (U )\n\u03b6(U )\n\ncan be extended and defined by continuity on the surface S.\nHypothesis 8. Let U \u2208 S be an equilibrium for (2.3), namely \u03b6(U ) = 0 and F (U ) = ~0. Then\nG(U ) = 0.\n\n(2.8)\n\nIn Section 1.1 we introduced, in the case of a toy model, the notion of slow and fast dynamics. These\nnotions will be extended in Section 4.1 to the general non linear case. Hypotheses 8 and 7 can be then reformulated saying that the set S is invariant for the manifold of the slow and of the fast dynamics respectively.\nRemark 2.1. Consider system\n\n1\ndU\n=\n\u03c6s (U ) + \u03c6ns (U ).\ndt\n\u03b6(U )\n\n(2.9)\n\nAlso, let f (U ) be a regular, real valued function such that f (~0) > 0. Clearly, (2.9) is equivalent to\ndU\n1\n=\n\u03c6s (U )f (U ) + \u03c6ns (U )\ndt\n\u03b6(U )f (U )\n\n(2.10)\n\nand \u03b6(U )f (U ) \u2192 0+ if and only if \u03b6(U ) \u2192 0+ , at least in a sufficiently small neighbourhood of U = ~0. By\ndirect check, one can verify that Hypotheses 1 . . . 8 are verified by the couple (\u03b6, F ) if and only if they are\nverified by the couple (\u03b6f, F f ).\n9\n\n\fRemark 2.2. As we will see in Section 4, Hypothesis 5 can be reformulated saying that the slow dynamics\nintersecting the singular manifold {U : \u03b6(U\n\u0001 ) = 0} are equilibria for system (2.3). Heuristically, this means\nthat we require that the limit as \u03b6 U (0) \u2192 0+ of a solution of (2.1) is a solution of the limit system. In\nother words, we want to rule out the possibility of a relaxation effect.\nAs it shown by the examples discussed in next section, the assumptions on the invariance of the manifold\n{U : \u03b6(U ) = 0} with respect to the slow and the fast dynamics (Hypothesis 7 and 8 respectively) are due\nto the fact that we want to have a smooth invertible time rescaling t = t(\u03c4 ) defined by (2.4).\n2.1.1\n\nThe case of the compressible Navier Stokes in Eulerian coordinates\n\nIn this section we show that Hypotheses 1, 3, . . . 8 are satisfied by the ODE for the viscous profiles of the\ncompressible Navier Stokes equation written in Eulerian coordinates. Also, Hypothesis 2 is not restrictive if\nthe goal is to study the viscous profiles entirely contained in a small neighbourhood of an equilibrium point.\nThe case of the Navier Stokes written in Lagrangian coordinates was already discussed for example in\nRousset [15]. When the equation is formulated using Lagrangian coordinates, the ODE satisfied by the\nviscous profiles is not singular.\nThe compressible Navier Stokes written in Eulerian coordinates is\n\uf8f1\n\u03c1t + (\u03c1v)\n\uf8f4\n\u0011\n\u0010x = 0 \u0011\n\u0010\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n(\u03c1v)t + \u03c1v 2 + p = \u03bdvx\nx\n\u0010\n\u0010 xh 1\n\u0011\ni\u0011\n\u0010\n2\u0011\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u03c1e + \u03c1 v\n2\n+ v \u03c1v + \u03c1e + p\n= k\u03b8x + \u03bdvvx .\n2 t\n2\nx\nx\n\n(2.11)\n\nHere, the unknowns are \u03c1(t, x), v(t, x) and \u03b8(t, x). The function \u03c1 represents the density of the fluid, v is\nthe velocity of the particles in the fluid and \u03b8 is the absolute temperature. The function p = p(\u03c1, \u03b8) > 0 is\nthe pressure and satisfies p\u03c1 > 0, while e represent the internal energy. In the case of a polytropic gas, the\nfollowing relation holds: e = \u03b8R/(\u03b3 \u2212 1), R being the universal gas constant and \u03b3 > 1 a constant specific\nof the gas. Finally, \u03bd(\u03c1) > 0 and k(\u03c1) > 0 represent the viscosity and the heat conduction coefficients\nrespectively.\nAfter some manipulations (see [6] for details), one gets that the equation satisfied by the steady solutions\nof the compressible Navier Stokes can be written in the form\ndU\n1\n=\nF (U )\ndx\n\u03b6(U )\n\u0010\n\u0011T\nprovided that U = \u03c1, v, \u03b8, ~z , \u03b6(U ) = v and\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec\nF (U ) = \uf8ed\n\nAt21 ~z/a11\nv ~z\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\ni \uf8f8\nh\nb\u22121 A22 v \u2212 A21 AT21 /a11 ~z\n\n(2.12)\n\nThe equation satisfied by the travelling waves of the compressible Navier Stokes equation in one space\nvariable is similar, the only difference being that the singular value is v = \u03c3, where \u03c3 is the speed of the\ntravelling wave.\n\u0001t\nIn (2.12), A21 is a vector in R2 and At21 denotes its transpose. Also, w = \u03c1x ad ~z = vx , \u03b8x . The\nfunction a11 is real valued and strictly positive if \u03c1 is bounded away from 0. The matrix b has dimension\n2 \u00d7 2 and all its eigenvalues have strictly positive real part. The exact expression of these terms is not\nimportant here.

Also,\nthe dimension of every center manifold of\ndU\n= F (U )\nd\u03c4\nis 3. Since the subspace {~z = ~0} is entirely constituted by equilibria of the equation, it coincides with\nthe center manifold. Thus, Hypothesis 5 is satisfied. Since \u03b6(U ) = v, then Hypothesis 4 is also verified.\nConcerning Hypothesis 6, this is satisfied because {~z = ~0} is transversal to the singular surface {v = 0}.\nFinally, by direct check one can show that also Hypotheses 7 and 8 are verified. Thus the machinery\ndeveloped in this work applies to the study of viscous profiles with small total variation of the compressible\nNavier Stokes equation written in Eulerian coordinates.\n\n2.2\n2.2.1\n\nExamples\nExample (2.14)\n\nExample (2.14) deals with a system which satisfies Hypotheses 1, 3 . . . 6 and Hypothesis 8, but does not\nsatisfy Hypothesis 7. We exhibit a solution of this system which has a blow up in the first derivative and\nhence it is not continuously differentiable. The loss of regularity experienced in Example (2.14) regards a\nsolution U such that \u03b6[U (0)] 6= 0, but \u03b6(U ) reaches the value 0 for a finite value of t.\nConsider the following system:\n\u001a\ndu1 /dt = \u2212u2 /u1\n(2.14)\ndu2 /dt = \u2212u2\n\u0010\n\u0011T\nLet U = u1 , u2 , \u03b6(U ) = u1 and\n\u03c6s (U ) =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2212u2\n0\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03c6ns (U ) =\n\n\u0012\n\n0\n\u2212u2\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\nSystem (2.14) can then be written in the form\n1\ndU\n=\n\u03c6s (U ) + \u03c6ns (U ).\ndt\n\u03b6(U )\nIn this case, the function F (U ) defined by (2.2) is\nF (U ) =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2212u2\n\u2212u2 u1\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\nBy direct check, one can verify that Hypotheses 1 . . . 6 and Hypothesis 8 are satisfied by (2.14). On the\nother side, Hypothesis 7 is not verified in this case. Indeed, the singular surface S defined by (2.6) is in this\ncase the line {u1 = 0} and\n\u2207\u03b6 * F = \u2212u2\nis in general different from 0 on S.\n\n11\n\n\fThe solution of (2.14) can be explicitly computed and it is given by\n\uf8f1\nq\n\u0001\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 u1 (t) = u1 (0) + u2 (0) e\u2212t \u2212 1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\nu2 (t) = u2 (0)e\n\n(2.15)\n\n\u2212t\n\nChoosing u2 (0) > u1 (0) > 0, one has that the solution u1 (t) can reach the value 0 for a finite t. Note that\nat that point t the first derivative du1 /dt blows up: thus, the solution (2.15) of (2.14) is not C 1 .\n2.2.2\n\nExample (2.16)\n\nExample (2.2.2) deals with system (2.16), which is apparently very similar to (2.14). However, in the case of\n(2.16) Hypotheses 1, 3 . . . 8 are all verified. We show the solutions of (2.16) are regular. Also, if \u03b6[U (0)] 6= 0\nthen \u03b6[U (t)] 6= 0 for all values of t.\nConsider system\n\u001a\ndu1 /dt = \u2212u2\n(2.16)\ndu2 /dt = \u2212u2 /u1\n\u0010\n\u0011T\nSet U = u1 , u2 , \u03b6(U ) = u1 . System (2.16) can be written in the form\n1\ndU\n=\n\u03c6s (U ) + \u03c6ns (U )\ndt\n\u03b6(U )\n\nprovided that\n\u03c6s (U ) =\n\n\u0012\n\n0\n\u2212u2\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03c6ns (U ) =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2212u2\n0\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\nAlso, the function F (U ) defined by (2.2) is in this case\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2212u2 u1\nF (U ) =\n.\n\u2212u2\nBy direct check, one can verify that Hypotheses 1 . . . 8 are all verified in this case.\nTo study system (2.16) we can proceed as follows. From (2.16) we have\ndu1 /dt\nu2\n=\u2212\n= du2 /dt\nu1\nu1\nand hence\n\n\"\n\n#\nu1 (t)\nln\n= u2 (t) \u2212 u2 (0).\nu1 (0)\n\nEventually, we obtain\nu1 (t) = u1 (0)eu2 (t)\u2212u2 (0) .\n\n(2.17)\n\nChoose u1 (0) > 0. To prove that u1 (t) 6= 0 for all t it is enough to show that u2 (t) is well defined (and in\nparticular finite) for every t > 0. In the following we also prove that u2 (t) is also C \u221e for every t \u2265 0. This\nguarantees that no loss of regularity occurs.\nPlugging (2.17) into the second line of (2.16) we get\ndu2 /dt = \u2212\n\nu2 u2 (0)\u2212u2 (t)\ne\n.\nu1 (0)\n\n(2.18)\n\nNote that u2 = 0 is an equilibrium for (2.18). Also, if u2 (0) < 0 then du2 /dt \u2265 0 and hence u2 (0) \u2264 u2 (t) < 0\nfor every t. Conversely, if u2 (0) > 0 then du2 /dt \u2264 0 and hence 0 \u2264 u2 (t) < u2 (0) for every t. In both cases,\nwe get that u2 (t) is well defined and regular for every t \u2265 0.\n12\n\n\f2.2.3\n\nExample (2.19)\n\nWith Example (2.2.3) we discuss a system which satisfies Hypotheses 1, 3 . . . 7, but does not satisfy Hypothesis 8. As in Example (2.14), we exhibit a solution of this system which is not continuously differentiable\nand the loss of regularity regards a solution U such that \u03b6[U (0)] 6= 0, but \u03b6(U ) reaches the value 0 for a\nfinite value of t.\nConsider the following system:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 du1 /dt = \u2212u3\ndu2 /dt = \u2212u2 /u1\n(2.19)\n\uf8f3\ndu3 /dt = \u2212u3\n\u0011T\n\u0010\nLet U = u1 , u2 , u3 , \u03b6(U ) = u1 and\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0\n\u2212u3\n\u03c6s (U ) = \uf8ed \u2212u2 \uf8f8\n\u03c6ns (U ) = \uf8ed 0 \uf8f8 .\n0\n\u2212u3\nSystem (2.14) can then be written in the form\n\n1\ndU\n=\n\u03c6s (U ) + \u03c6ns (U )\ndt\n\u03b6(U )\nand the function F (U ) defined by (2.2) is\n\uf8f6\n\u2212u3 u1\nF (U ) = \uf8ed \u2212u2 \uf8f8 .\n\u2212u3 u1\n\uf8eb\n\nBy direct check, one can verify that Hypotheses 1 . . . 7 are verified by (2.19). On the other side, Hypothesis\n8 is not satisfied in this case. Indeed, the surface S = {U : \u03b6(U ) = 0} is the plane {u1 = 0}. Thus, the set\nof points such that \u03b6(U ) = 0 and F (U ) = ~0 is {u1 = u2 = 0} and\n\u0010 \u0011T\n\u2207\u03b6 * DF * \u2207\u03b6\n= \u2212u3\n\nis in general different from zero on this line.\nAn explicit solution of (2.19) can be obtained as follows. From the third and the first equation we get\nrespectively\nu3 (t) = u3 (0)e\u2212t\nu1 (t) = u1 (0) \u2212 u3 (0) + u3 (0)e\u2212t .\nAssume that u3 (0) = Au1 (0) for some constant A whose exact value is determined in the following. The\nequation satisfied by u2 becomes\nu2\ndu2\n=\u2212\n.\n\u2212t\ndt\nAu1 (0)e + u1 (0)(1 \u2212 A)\nThus, we obtain\n\nand hence\n\n\u0011i\n\u0011i\n1\ndh \u0010\ndh \u0010\nln u2 (t) =\nln u1 (0)(1 \u2212 A)et + Au1 (0)\ndt\nu1 (0)(A \u2212 1) dt\n1\ni\n(A\n\u2212\n1)u\n1 (0)\nu2 (t) = B (1 \u2212 A)e + A\nh\n\nt\n\nfor a suitable constant B. If (A \u2212 1)u1 (0) > 1, then the first derivative du2 /dt blows up at t = ln(A/A \u2212 1).\nNote that this is exactly the value of t at which u1 (t) attains 0.\nIn general, for every u1 (0) > 0 if 1/(A \u2212 1)u1 (0) is not a natural number, then the solution is not in\nC m for m = [1/(A \u2212 1)u1 (0)] + 1. Here [1/(A \u2212 1)u1 (0)] denotes the entire part. Thus, we have a loss of\nregularity in higher derivatives.\n13\n\n\f3\n\nUniformly stable manifolds\n\nIn this section we consider the system\n\ndU\n= F (U ),\nd\u03c4\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere U \u2208 RN and the F : RN \u2192 RN is a regular function. We are interested in the behavior of the solutions\nin a small enough neighbourhood of an equilibrium point. We can then assume that such an equilibrium\npoint is ~0, namely F (~0) = ~0. Also, we assume\n|U | \u2265 2\u03b4 =\u21d2 F (U ) = ~0.\n\n(3.2)\n\nBecause of Hypothesis 2, (3.2) is not restrictive in view of the applications discussed in Section 4. Also,\nbecause of Hypothesis 3 we assume that all the eigenvalues of the Jacobian DF (~0) have non positive real\npart. Note, however, that in this Section we exploit none among Hypotheses 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8.\n\n3.1\n3.1.1\n\nNotations and preliminary results\nFr\u00e9chet differentiability of the fixed point of a family of maps\n\nIn the following we have to study the regularity of the fixed points of a family of maps depending on a\nparameter. To do this, we exploit Lemma 3.1. Note that the hypotheses there are not sharp and the result\ncould be improved. However, to avoid technical complications we restrict to those hypotheses since they are\nsatisfied in the cases we discuss in the following.\nLet X be a closed subset with non empty interior in a Banach space X\u0303 and let Y be an open subset of\nanother Banach space \u1ef8 . Also, let\nT : X \u00d7 Y \u2192 X\u0303\nbe a map such that, for every y \u2208 Y , T (*, y) takes values in X and is a strict contraction, namely there\nexists some constant k < 1 such that\nkT (x1 , y) \u2212 T (x2 , y)kX\u0303 \u2264 kkx1 \u2212 x2 kX\u0303\n\n\u2200 x1 , x2 \u2208 X.\n\nThanks to the Contraction Mapping Theorem, we can define a map\nY \u2192X\nwhich associates to y the fixed point of the map T (*, y). We denote this map by x(y) and we are interested\nin its regularity. Assume that, for every y, x(y) belongs to the inner part of X. Also, assume that, for\nevery (x\u0304, \u0233) \u2208 X \u00d7 Y such that x\u0304 is an inner point, T (*, \u0233) is Fr\u00e9chet differentiable at x\u0304 and denote by\nTx (x\u0304, \u0233) \u2208 L(X\u0303, X\u0303) its differential. Also, assume that, for every (x\u0304, \u0233) in the same conditions as before, the\nmap T (x\u0304, *) is Fr\u00e9chet differentiable at \u0233 and denote by Ty (x\u0304, \u0233) \u2208 L(\u1ef8 , X\u0303) its differential.\nThe proof of the following result relies on standard techniques (see for example the book by Ambrosetti\nand Prodi [1]) and will be therefore omitted.\nLemma 3.1. Assume that the map x(y) is Lipschitz continuous and fix a point (x\u0304, \u0233) such that x\u0304 = x(\u0233).\nAlso, assume that T is Fr\u00e9chet differentiable with respect to the variable y at the point (x\u0304, \u0233), namely Ty (x\u0304, \u0233)\nexists. If Tx (x, y) is defined and continuous in a neighbourhood of (x\u0304, \u0233), then x(y) is Fr\u00e9chet differentiable\nat \u0233 and the differential is\nh\n\u0001\n\u0001i\u22121\n(3.3)\n\u25e6 Ty x(\u0233), \u0233 ,\nI \u2212 Tx x(\u0233), \u0233\nwhere I denotes the identity.\nh\n\u0002\n\u0003i\nNote that the map I \u2212 Tx x(\u0233), \u0233 is invertible because T (*, \u0233) is a strict contraction on X.\n\n14\n\n\fRemark 3.1. We want to give a sufficient condition to have that x(y) is Lipschitz continous. Assume that\nthere exists a constant L such that, for every y1 , y2 \u2208 Y ,\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(3.4)\nkT x(y1 ), y1 \u2212 T x(y1 ), y2 kX \u2264 Lky1 \u2212 y2 kY .\nThen the map x(y) is Lipschitz continuous. Indeed,\n\u0001\n\u0001\nkx(y1 ) \u2212 x(y2 )kX = kT x(y1 ), y1 \u2212 T x(y2 ), y2 kX\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u2264 kT x(y1 ), y1 \u2212 T x(y1 ), y2 kX + kT x(y1 ), y2 \u2212 T x(y2 ), y2 kX\n\u2264 Lky1 \u2212 y2 kY + kkx(y1 ) \u2212 x(y2 )kX\n\nSince k < 1, we get that x(y) is Lipschitz continuous.\n3.1.2\n\nFirst change of variables\n\nConsider system (3.1). Let V \u2212 be the eigenspace of the Jacobian DF (~0) associated to eigenvalues with\nstrictly negative real part. Also, let V 0 be the eigenspace associated to the eigenvalues with 0 real part.\nAlso, fix V 0 , a center manifold of (3.1) around the equilibrium ~0. Finally, let V \u2212 be the stable manifold. The\nmanifolds V 0 and V \u2212 are tangent at the origin to V 0 and V \u2212 respectively. Note that RN = V 0 \u2295 V \u2212 because\nDF (~0) admits only eigenvalues with non positive real part. Thanks to the local invertibility theorem, in a\nsufficiently small neighbourhood of the origin we can define a local diffeomorphism \u03a5 such that the following\nconditions are satisfied. Let \u016a = \u03a5(U ), then \u016a satisfies\nd\u016a\n= f \u0304(\u016a ),\nd\u03c4\n\n(3.5)\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\nwhere f \u0304(\u016a ) = D\u03a5 \u03a5\u22121 (\u016a ) F \u03a5\u22121 (\u016a ) . Write \u016a = (X\u0304 \u2212 , X\u0304 0 ), where X\u0304 0 has the same dimension as V 0\nand X\u0304 \u2212 has the same dimension as V \u2212 . Then the stable manifold of (3.5) is the subspace {X\u0304 0 \u2261 ~0}, while\nthe center manifold is the subspace {X\u0304 \u2212 \u2261 ~0}. In the following, we assume that the constant \u03b4 in (3.1) is\nsmall enough to have that the local diffeomorphism \u03a5 is defined in the ball of radius 2\u03b4 and center at the\norigin. Also, to simplify the notations we do not write \u016a , X\u0304 \u2212 and X\u0304 0 , but just U , X \u2212 and X 0 .\n3.1.3\n\nA priori estimates\n\nWe rewrite system (3.5) as\n\u001a\n\ndX \u2212 /d\u03c4 = f \u2212 (X \u2212 , X 0 )\ndX 0 /d\u03c4 = f 0 (X \u2212 , X 0 )\n\n(3.6)\n\nThe subspaces {X \u2212 = ~0} and {X 0 = ~0} are locally invariant for (3.6) since they represent respectively a\ncenter and the stable manifold. Thus, f \u2212 (~0, X 0 ) \u2261 ~0 for every X 0 and f 0 (X \u2212 , ~0) \u2261 0 for every X \u2212 . As a\nconsequence,\nf \u2212 (X \u2212 , X 0 ) = A\u2212 (X \u2212 , X 0 )X \u2212\nf 0 (X \u2212 , X 0 ) = \u00c20 (X \u2212 , X 0 )X 0\n(3.7)\nfor a suitable matrices A\u2212 and A0 . By construction, A\u2212 (~0, ~0) admits only eigenvalues with strictly negative\nreal part and \u00c20 (~0, ~0) has only eigenvalues with zero real part. As a consequence, the following holds. Let\nn\u2212 denote the dimension of X \u2212 and fix a constant c > 0 satisfying Re\u03bb < \u2212c for every \u03bb eigenvalue of\nA\u2212 (~0, ~0).

Assume that there exists a continuously differentiable manifold Z0 containing the stable manifold\n{X 0 = ~0} and satisfying\nf 0 (X \u2212 , X 0 ) = ~0\n\u2200 (X \u2212 , X 0 ) \u2208 Z0 .\n(3.10)\nActually, this assumption is not restrictive, in the sense explained in Remark 3.2 at the end of Section 3.1.3.\nApplying, if needed, a local diffeomorphism, we can assume that X 0 = (\u03b6, u0 ) and that Z0 = {\u03b6 = ~0}.\nSince the stable manifold is entirely contained in Z0 , such a diffeomorphism does not produce any change\non X \u2212 , but only on X 0 . In the following we assume that the constant \u03b4 in Hypothesis 2 is so small that the\nlocal diffeomorphism is defined in the ball of radius 2\u03b4 and center at the origin.\nConsider the system restricted on the center manifold {X \u2212 = ~0}: since the subspace {\u03b6 = ~0} is entirely\nmade by equilibria, then we get that the equation\ndX 0 /d\u03c4 = \u00c20 (~0, X 0 )X 0\nbecomes\n\n\u001a\n\nd\u03b6/d\u03c4 = B\u0302(~0, \u03b6, u0 )\u03b6\ndu0 /d\u03c4 = \u0108(~0, \u03b6, u0 )\u03b6,\n\n(3.11)\n\nwhere B\u0302 and \u0108 are suitable matrices. Note that, by construction, B\u0302(~0, ~0, ~0) admits only eigenvalues with\nzero real part. Fix a constant \u03b5 such that Re\u03bb < \u2212\u03b5 < 0 for any \u03bb eigenvalue of A\u2212 (~0, ~0): also, we impose\n\u03b5 < c, where c is the same as in (3.8). Assuming that the constant \u03b4 in Hypothesis 2 is sufficiently small we\ncan assume that every solution \u03b6 of (3.11) satisfies\n|\u03b6(\u03c4 )| \u2264 O(1)e\u03b5|\u03c4 | |\u03b6(0)|\n\n(3.12)\n\nfor some suitable constant O(1). Since in (3.11) the matrix \u0108 is uniformly bounded, we get that\n|u0 (\u03c4 ) \u2212 u0 (0)| \u2264 O(1)e\u03b5|\u03c4 | |\u03b6(0)|\n\n(3.13)\n\nfor a constant O(1) (possibly different from the one in (3.12)). We introduce the following notation: given\na point X 0 = (\u03b6, u0 ) on the center manifold we call Y 0 the point\nY 0 = (~0, u0 ).\n0\n\n(3.14)\n\n0\n\nClearly Y depends on X , but to simplify the notations we won't express this dependence explicitly.\nCombining (3.12) and (3.13) we then obtain\n|X 0 (\u03c4 ) \u2212 Y 0 (0)| \u2264 k0 e\u03b5|\u03c4 | |\u03b6(0)|\n\n(3.15)\n\nfor a suitable constant k0 .\nFinally, note that, since both A\u2212 and \u00c2 are zero when |(X \u2212 , X 0 )| \u2265 2\u03b4, then any non constant solution\nof (3.9) satisfies\n|X 0 (\u03c4 )| \u2264 2\u03b4\n|X \u2212 (\u03c4 )| \u2264 2\u03b4\n\u2200 \u03c4.\n(3.16)\nRemark 3.2. The hypothesis that there exists a manifold of zeroes Z0 is not restrictive. Indeed, assume\nthat the set of the zeroes of f 0 coincides with the stable manifold {X 0 = ~0}. In this case, we can set \u03b6 = X 0 ,\nthe component u0 disappears and given X 0 the element Y 0 is just X 0 itself. This notation ensures that the\nestimate (3.15) still holds. As it will be clear from the the following, the only fact about Z0 we exploit in\nthe proof of Proposition 3.1 is estimate (3.15). As a consequence, Proposition 3.1 can be extended to the\ncase Z0 is just the stable manifold.\nIn other words, the presence of a manifold of zeroes wider then the stable manifold is not strictly necessary\nfor the existence of the uniformly stable manifold introduced in Theorem 3.1. However, it allows to get a\nsharper estimate in (3.24).\n16\n\n\f3.1.4\n\nLinear change of variables\n\nIn the statement of the following lemma we denote by nc the dimension of X 0 , then N = nc + n\u2212 . The\nproof is standard, so we omit it.\nLemma 3.2. For every M > 0, there exists a linear change of variables Rnc \u2192 Rnc such that in the new\ncoordinates X 0 satisfies\ndX 0 /d\u03c4 = \u00c2(X \u2212 , X 0 )X 0 ,\n(3.17)\nfor a suitable matrix such that\n\n\u00c20 (~0, ~0) = \u01000 + N 0 ,\n\n(3.18)\n\nwhere \u01000 and N 0 enjoy the following properties:\n0\n\n|e\u0100 t X 0 | \u2264 |X 0 |\nand\n|N 0 X 0 | \u2264\n\n\u2200t > 0, X 0 \u2208 Rnc\n\n1\n|X 0 |, X 0 \u2208 Rnc .\nM\n\n(3.19)\n\n(3.20)\n\nWe specify in the following how we chose the constant M .\nRemark 3.3. If we apply the linear change of coordinates introduced in Lemma 3.2, then it is no more true\nthat X 0 = (\u03b6, u0 ) where {\u03b6 = ~0} is the manifold Z0 of equilbria for f 0 . However, estimate (3.15) still holds,\nprovided that we change if needed the value of the constant k0 and we take, instead of X 0 (\u03c4 ), Y 0 and \u03b6(0),\ntheir images trough the linear change of variables.\n\n3.2\n\nUniformly stable manifold of an orbit\n\nWe are now ready to introduce Theorem 3.1. In formula (3.24), \u03b6 is the component of X 0 = (\u03b6, u0 ) according\nto the decomposition introduced in Section 3.1.2.\nTheorem 3.1. Let Hypotheses 2 and 3 hold. If the constant \u03b4 in Hypothesis 2 is sufficiently small, then the\nfollowing holds.\n\u0001\nFix an orbit Y 0 (\u03c4 ) = ~0, X 0 (\u03c4 ) of\n\u001a\n\ndX \u2212 /d\u03c4 = A\u2212 (X \u2212 , X 0 )X \u2212\ndX 0 /d\u03c4 = \u00c20 (X \u2212 , X 0 )X 0\n\n(3.21)\n\nthat lies on the center manifold and satisfies |X 0 (0)| < \u03b4. Then we can define a uniformly stable manifold\nrelative to Y 0 (\u03c4 ). This manifold is defined in the ball of radius \u03b4 and center at the origin, is parameterized by\n{X 0 = ~0} and is tangent to this subspace at the origin. Also, it\n\u0001 is locally invariant for (3.21), meaning that\nif the initial datum lies on the manifold, then X \u2212 (\u03c4 ), X 0 (\u03c4 ) belongs to the uniformly stable manifold for\n|\u03c4 | sufficiently small. Every orbit lying on the uniformly stable manifold relative to Y 0 (\u03c4 ) can be decomposed\nas\nX(\u03c4 ) = Y 0 (\u03c4 ) + Y \u2212 (\u03c4 ) + U p (\u03c4 ),\n(3.22)\n\u0001\nwhere the components Y \u2212 = X \u2212 (\u03c4 ), ~0 and U p (\u03c4 ) satisfy respectively\n|X \u2212 (\u03c4 )| \u2264 k\u2212 |X \u2212 (0)|e\u2212c\u03c4 /2\n\n(3.23)\n\n|U p (\u03c4 )| \u2264 kp |\u03b6(0)| |X \u2212 (0)|e\u2212c\u03c4 /4 .\n\n(3.24)\n\nand\nIn (3.23) and (3.24), c, k\u2212 and kp are suitable constants. In particular, c is the same as in (3.8).\n\n17\n\n\f3.3\n\nProof of Theorem 3.1\n\nLet the orbit (~0, X 0 (\u03c4 )) be given. We denote by X 0 = X 0 (0) and by Y 0 the corresponding projection,\ndefined as in (3.14). Also, if we write X 0 = (\u03b6(0), u0 (0)) then we set\n\u03b6 = \u03b6(0).\n\n(3.25)\n\nBy definition, X 0 (\u03c4 ) is a solution of the Cauchy problem\n\u001a\ndX 0 /d\u03c4 = \u00c20 (~0, X 0 )\nX 0 (0) = X 0\n\n(3.26)\n\nThe proof of Theorem 3.1 is divided in several steps: in Section 3.3.1 we introduce the spaces of functions\nwe exploit in the proof. In Section 3.3.2 we are concerned with the component Y \u2212 (\u03c4 ) in (3.22). In Section\n3.3.3 we deal with the \"perturbation\" term U p (\u03c4 ) in (3.22). Both the components Y \u2212 (\u03c4 ) and U p (\u03c4 ) are\nobtained as fixed points of suitable contractions: in Section 3.3.4 we study their regularity applying Lemma\n3.1. Finally, in Section 3.3.5 we conclude the proof of Theorem 3.1 putting together all the considerations\ncarried on in Sections 3.3.1. 3.3.2, 3.3.3 and 3.3.4.\n3.3.1\n\nDefinition of the functional spaces\n\nLet n\u2212 denote the dimension of X \u2212 . Also, nc denotes the dimension of X 0 , as in the statement of Lemma\n3.2.\nIn the following we exploit the following Banach spaces of functions:\no\nn\n\u0001\n(3.27)\nY \u2212 = X \u2212 \u2208 C 0 [0, +\u221e[, Rn\u2212 : kX \u2212 k\u2212 < +\u221e\n\nand\n\nn\no\n\u0001\nY 0 = X 0 \u2208 C 0 [0, +\u221e[, Rnc : kX 0 k0 < +\u221e ,\n\nwhere the norms k * k\u2212 and k * k0 are defined as follows:\n\b\n\b\nkX 0 k0 = sup e\u2212\u03b5|\u03c4 | |X 0 (\u03c4 )|\nkX \u2212 k\u2212 = sup ec\u03c4 /2 |X \u2212 (\u03c4 )|\n\n(3.28)\n\n(3.29)\n\n\u03c4\n\n\u03c4\n\nThe constants c and \u03b5 are the same as in (3.8) and (3.15) respectively. Also, we consider the following closed\nsubsets of Y \u2212 and Y 0 :\no\no\nn\nn\n\u0001\n\u0001\nY\u03b40 = X 0 \u2208 C 0 [0, +\u221e[, Rnc : kX 0 k0 \u2264 k0 \u03b4.\nY\u03b4\u2212 = X \u2212 \u2208 C 0 [0, +\u221e[, Rn\u2212 : kX \u2212 k\u2212 \u2264 k\u2212 \u03b4.\n(3.30)\nWe specify in the following how to determine the exact value of the constant k\u2212 , while the constant k0 is\nthe same as in (3.15). Also, note that the spaces Y\u03b4\u2212 and Y\u03b40 are equipped with the same norms k * k\u2212 and\nk * k0 as Y \u2212 and Y 0 respectively.\nWe will also need the space of functions defined as follows. Let c be as (3.8) and let a \u2208 [0, c[.

We specify in the following how to determine the values of\nthe constants kp and a.\n18\n\n\f3.3.2\n\nAnalysis of the stable component\n\nThis step is devoted to the definition of Y \u2212 (\u03c4 ) = (X \u2212 (\u03c4 ), ~0). Fix a vector X \u2212 \u2208 Rn\u2212 satisfying |X \u2212 | < \u03b4.\nWe define X \u2212 (\u03c4 ) as the solution of the Cauchy problem\n\u001a\ndX \u2212 /d\u03c4 = A\u2212 (X \u2212 , Y 0 )X \u2212\n(3.33)\nX \u2212 (0) = X \u2212 ,\nwhere Y 0 is given by (3.14).

The space Y\u03b4\u2212 is defined in (3.30). More precisely, if the constant k\u2212 in (3.30) satisfies\nk\u2212 \u2264 C\u2212 and the constant \u03b4 is (3.30) is sufficiently small, then the map T \u2212 takes values in Y\u03b4\u2212 and is indeed\na contraction. Also, the fixed point satisfies\n|X \u2212 (\u03c4 )| \u2264 k\u2212 |X \u2212 |e\u2212c\u03c4 /2\n\n(3.35)\n\nWe are now interested in the differentiability of the fixed point with respect to Y 0 and X \u2212 .

We then perform the linear change of variables which is the inverse of the change of variables\nintroduced in Lemma\n3.2. In \u0011\nthis way, we go back to the original variables. To simplify the notations, we\n\u0010\n\u2212\n0\nstill denote by U (\u03c4 ), U (\u03c4 ) the functions obtained applying the change of variables.\nTo define the map that parameterizes the uniformly stable manifold we proceed as follows: the orbit\nX 0 (\u03c4 ) is fixed. For every X \u2208 Rn\u2212 , there exists a unique solution of (3.33). Also, in Section 3.3.2 we showed\nthat the map\nX \u2192 X \u2212 (\u03c4 )\n(3.49)\nis continuously differentiable in the sense of Frech\u00e9t. As a consequence, the map obtained composing (3.49)\nand (3.48) is Frech\u00e9t differentiable. Note that such a map associates to X \u2212 the functions (X \u2212 , U \u2212 , U 0 ).\nThe function \u03c6 that parameterizes the uniformly stable manifold is then defined by setting\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03c6(X) = X \u2212 (0), X 0 (0) + U 0 (0) .\nThanks to the\n\b previous considerations, \u03c6 is continuously differentiable and the manifold is tangent to the\nstable space (X \u2212 , ~0) : X \u2212 \u2208 R\u2212 at the origin. Also, estimate (3.24) is a consequence of (3.42).\nThis concludes the proof of Theorem 3.1.\n\n3.4\n\nUniformly stable manifolds\n0\n\nLet V be a fixed center manifold for the equation\ndU\n= F (U ),\nd\u03c4\n23\n\n(3.50)\n\n\fwhich satisfies Hypotheses 2 and 3 introduced in Section 2. In Theorem 3.1 we consider a fixed orbit lying\non V 0 and we construct the uniformly stable manifold relative to that orbit. In this section we discuss what\nhappens if, instead of having a single orbit, we have a whole invariant manifold.\nMore precisely, let S0 be an invariant manifold for (3.9) and assume that S0 is entirely contained in the\ncenter manifold {X \u2212 = ~0}. Also, denote by S0 the tangent space to S0 at the origin. Choosing a sufficiently\nsmall constant in Hypothesis 2, we can assume that S0 is parameterized by S0 . By construction, S0 is\ncontained in {X \u2212 = ~0}. Also, as in Section 3.1.3 assume that Z0 = {(X \u2212 , ~0, u0 ) : \u03b6 = ~0} is a manifold of\nzeroes for the function f0 in (3.6).\nAs a consequence of Theorem 3.1, we get the following result:\nProposition 3.1. Let Hypotheses 2 and 3 hold. Let S0 be an invariant manifold for (3.9) entirely contained\nin the center manifold {X \u2212 = ~0}. If the constant \u03b4 in Hypothesis 2 is sufficiently small, then the following\nholds.\nThere exists a continuously differentiable manifold Mus\nS0 which is defined in the ball of radius \u03b4 and center\nat the origin. Also, Mus\nsatisfies\nthe\nfollowing\nproperties:\nS0\n1. Mus\nS0 is locally invariant\u0001 for (3.9), meaning that if the initial datum lies on the manifold, then the\nsolution (X \u2212 (\u03c4 ), X 0 (\u03c4 ) of (3.9) lies on Mus\nS0 for |\u03c4 | sufficiently small.\n\n0\n\u2212\n2. Mus\nand it is tangent to this space at the origin. Here, S0 is the tangent\nS0 is parameterized by S \u00d7 V\n0\n\u2212\nspace to S at the origin and V = {(X \u2212 , ~0) : X 0 = ~0}.\n\n3. Any orbit Y (\u03c4 ) lying on Mus\nS0 can be decomposed as\nY (\u03c4 ) = Y 0 (\u03c4 ) + Y \u2212 (\u03c4 ) + Y p (\u03c4 ),\n\n(3.51)\n\u0001\n\u0001\nwhere Y 0 (\u03c4 ) = ~0, \u03b6 0 (\u03c4 ), u0 (\u03c4 ) is an orbit lying on S0 . The component Y \u2212 (\u03c4 ) = X \u2212 (\u03c4 ), ~0, ~0 lies\non the stable manifold and the perturbation term Y p (\u03c4 ) satisfies\n|Y p (\u03c4 )| \u2264 C|\u03b6 0 (0)| |Y \u2212 (0)|e\u2212c\u03c4 /4 ,\n\n(3.52)\n\nfor some positive constant C. In (3.52), the constant c > 0 is the same as in (3.8).\nIn the following we call Mus\nS0 the uniformly stable manifold relative to S0 .\n\u0001\n\u0001\nProof. Let ~0, X 0 (\u03c4 ) and X \u2212 (\u03c4 ), ~0 be two orbits of (3.9) lying on the center manifold {X \u2212 = ~0} and on\nthe stable manifold respectively. We then have X 0 (\u03c4 ) \u2208 Y\u03b40 , X \u2212 (\u03c4 ) \u2208 Y\u03b4\u2212 , where the metric spaces Y\u03b40 and\nY\u03b4\u2212 are defined by (3.30). As in Section 3.3, we use the notation Y = Y\u03b4\u2212 \u00d7 Y\u03b40 . Consider the map\np\n\u03a6 : Y \u2192 Y \u00d7 Y\u03b40\n\n\u0001\nwhich associates to X \u2212 (\u03c4 ) and X 0 (\u03c4 ) the function X \u2212 (\u03c4 ), X 0 (\u03c4 ), U \u2212 (\u03c4 ), U 0 (\u03c4 ) , where (U \u2212 , U 0 ) is the\np\nperturbation term constructed in Section 3.3.3. We recall that Y\u03b40\nis the set obtained setting a = 0 in (3.32).\nAs shown in Section 3.3.4, the map \u03a6 is continuously differentiable in the sense of Frech\u00e9t. Also, let\nf \u2212 : {X 0 = ~0} \u00d7 {X \u2212 = ~0} \u2192 Y\u03b4\u2212\nbe the map that associates to (X \u2212 , \u03b6, u0 ) \u2208 Z0 the unique solution of the Cauchy problem (3.33). We recall\nthat in (3.33) Y 0 denotes (~0, u0 ). As shown in Section 3.3.2, the map f \u2212 is continuously differentiable in\nthe sense of Frech\u00e9t. Also, let\nf 0 : {X \u2212 = ~0} \u2192 Y\u03b40\nbe the map that associates to (X 0 , ~0) the unique solution of the Cauchy problem (3.26). The map f 0 is also\ncontinuously differentiable in the sense of Frech\u00e9t. Finally, fix a continuously differentiable map\ng 0 : S0 \u2192 V 0\n24\n\n\fparameterizing S0 . Define the map\n\np\n\u03c8 : S0 \u00d7 V 0 \u2192 Y \u00d7 Y\u03b40\n\nsetting\n0\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c8(X , X ) = \u03a6 f\n\n\u2212\n\n\u0010\n\n!\n\u0011\n0\n0\n0\nX , g(X ) , f \u25e6 g (X ) .\n\u2212\n\n0\n\n(3.53)\n\n0\n\u2212\nThe map \u03c8 is then continuously differentiable in the\n\u0001 sense of Frech\u00e9t. By construction, \u03c8(X , X ) is an\n\u2212\n0\n\u2212\n0\nelement in the form X (\u03c4 ), X (\u03c4 ), U (\u03c4 ), U (\u03c4 ) and, setting\n\u0010\n\u0011\nY (\u03c4 ) = X \u2212 (\u03c4 ) + U \u2212 (\u03c4 ), X 0 (\u03c4 ) + U 0 (\u03c4 ) ,\n\n\u0001\nwe get that Y (\u03c4 ) can be decomposed as in (3.51). Also, the perturbation term U 0 , U \u2212 automatically\nsatisfies (3.52). We then define the map\n\u03c80 : S0 \u00d7 V \u2212 \u2192 Rnc +n\u2212\nparameterizing Mus\nS0 by setting\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03c80 (X 0 , X \u2212 ) = X \u2212 (0), X 0 (0) + U 0 (0) = Y (0),\n\nwhere X 0 (\u03c4 ), X \u2212 (\u03c4 ) and U 0 (\u03c4 ) are given by (3.53).\nThe map \u03c80 is continuously differentiable, being the composition of maps that are continuously differentiable in the sense of Frech\u00e9t. Also, by construction the manifold Mus\nS0 is invariant for (3.9).

In doing this, we apply the results obtained in Section 3 to study the singular ordinary differential\nequation\ndU\n1\n=\nF (U ).\n(4.1)\ndt\n\u03b6(U )\nActually, most of the time we focus on system\ndU\n= F (U ).\nd\u03c4\n\n(4.2)\n\nWe discuss several situations where (4.1) and (4.2) are equivalent, namely the Cauchy problem\n\u001a\nd\u03c4 /dt = 1/\u03b6[U (t)]\n\u03c4 (0) = 0\ndefines a continuously differentiable diffeomorphism \u03c4 : [0, +\u221e[\u2192 [0, +\u221e[.\nIn Section 4 we exploit all Hypotheses 1 . . . 8. Also, we rely on Proposition 4.1, whose proof is given in\nSection 4.3. Before stating it, we have to introduce some notations. Let N denote the dimension of U . Also,\nn\u2212 is the number of eigenvalues of DF (~0) with strictly negative real part, while (n0 + 1) is the number of\neigenvalues of DF (~0) with zero real part. Each eigenvalue is counted according to its multiplicity. Thanks\nto Hypothesis 3, N = n\u2212 + n0 + 1.\n\n25\n\n\fProposition 4.1. Let Hypotheses 1 . . . 8 hold. If the constant \u03b4 in Hypothesis 2 is sufficiently small, then\nin the ball with radius \u03b4 and center at the origin we can define a continuously differentiable diffeomorphism\n\u03a5 satisfying the following properties. Write \u03a5(U ) = \u016a as a column vector:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u03b6\n\u016a = \uf8ed u0 \uf8f8 ,\nu\u2212\nwhere \u03b6 \u2208 R, u0 \u2208 Rn0 and u\u2212 \u2208 Rn\u2212 .

Let Mus\nE be the uniformly stable manifold relative to the manifold\n~\n~\nE = {(\u03b6, ~0, ~0) : u0 = ~0, u\u2212 = ~0}, which is entirely constituted by equilibria. Then Mus\nE = {(\u03b6, 0, u\u2212 ) : u0 = 0}.\nIn the statement of Proposition 4.1 by uniformly stable manifold relative to E we mean the manifold\ndefined by Proposition 3.1. Also, note that by construction all the eigenvalues of the matrix Gs (0, ~0, ~0) have\nstrictly negative real part.\n\n4.1\n\nSlow and fast dynamics\n\nLet E denote, as before, the manifold of equilibria {(\u03b6, ~0, ~0) : u0 = ~0, u\u2212 = ~0}.\nDefinition 4.1. A manifold of slow dynamics is a center manifold of (4.3). In the following we fix the\nmanifold of the slow dynamics {u\u2212 = ~0} and we denote it by M0 .\nThe manifold of fast dynamics of system (4.3) is the uniformly stable manifold relative to E, namely the\nsubspace {u0 = ~0}.\nNote that both these manifolds are invariant for system (4.3). Also, for every point (\u03b6, ~0, u\u2212 ) belonging\n\u0001\nto the manifold of fast dynamics, denote by \u03b6(\u03c4 ), ~0, u\u2212 (\u03c4 ) the solution of (4.3) such that\n\u0001\n\u03b6(0), ~0, u\u2212 (0) = (\u03b6, ~0, u\u2212 ).\n\nCombining (3.51) and (3.52) we get that this solution decays exponentially fast to an equilibrium point.\nNamely, there exists \u03b6\u221e such that\nlim ec\u03c4 /4 |u\u2212 (\u03c4 )| = 0 = lim ec\u03c4 /4 |\u03b6(\u03c4 ) \u2212 \u03b6\u221e |,\n\n\u03c4 \u2192+\u221e\n\n\u03c4 \u2192+\u221e\n\nwhere the positive constant c satisfies Re\u03bb < \u2212c for every \u03bb eigenvalue of Gs (0, ~0, ~0).\nConsider system (4.3) reduced on the manifold of slow dynamics:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 d\u03b6/d\u03c4 = \u03b6 2 G10 (\u03b6, u0 )u0\ndu0 /d\u03c4 = G01 (\u03b6, u0 )u0 \u03b6\n\uf8f3\nu\u2212 \u2261 0\n\nIf one goes back to the original variable t obtains\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 d\u03b6/dt = \u03b6G10 (\u03b6, u0 )u0\ndu0 /dt = G01 (\u03b6, u0 )u0\n\uf8f3\nu\u2212 \u2261 0,\n26\n\n(4.4)\n\n(4.5)\n\n\fnamely an equation with no singularity. Note that (4.4) and (4.5) are equivalent. Indeed, by the uniqueness\nof the solution of a Cauchy problem associated to (4.5), the following holds. If \u03b6(0) > 0 then \u03b6(t) > 0 for\nevery t. Thus, the Cauchy problem\n\uf8f1\n1\nd\u03c4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n=\n\uf8f2\ndt\n\u03b6(t)\n(4.6)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u03c4 (0) = 0\n\nadmits a global solution \u03c4 : [0, +\u221e[\u2192 [0, +\u221e[ whose derivative is always different from 0. Thus, \u03c4 (t) defines\na change of variables and (4.4) is equivalent to (4.5).\nOne of our original goals is to study the solutions of\ndU\n\u03c6s (U )\n=\n+ \u03c6ns (U )\ndt\n\u03b6(U )\n\nlying on a center manifold. Let M00 be a center manifold for (4.5) around the equilibrium point (0, ~0, ~0).\nThen M00 is a center manifold for\n\uf8f1\nd\u03b6\n\uf8f4\n= \u03b6G10 (\u03b6, u0 )u0 + G1\u2212 (\u03b6, u0 , u\u2212 )u\u2212\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\ndt\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 du\nn\n\u0002\n\u0003o\n0\n= G01 (\u03b6, u0 ) + G01 (\u03b6, u0 , u\u2212 ) \u2212 G0\u2212 (\u03b6, u0 , ~0) u0\n(4.7)\n\uf8f4\ndt\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 du\u2212 = 1 Gs (\u03b6, u0 , u\u2212 )u\u2212\ndt\n\u03b6\nWe collect these results in the following\n\nTheorem 4.1. Assume that Hypotheses 1 . . . 8 are satisfied. There exists an invariant center manifold\nM00 for system (4.7) around the equilibrium point (0, ~0, ~0) which is contained in the manifold of the slow\ndynamics. In particular, equation (4.7) restricted to M00 is non singular and every solution satisfies the\nfollowing property: if \u03b6(0) > 0, then \u03b6(t) > 0 for every t.\nRemark 4.1. Hypothesis 8 ensures that the manifold {U : \u03b6(U ) = 0} is invariant with respect to the slow\ndynamics. This hypothesis is not necessary to define an invariant center manifold M00 contained in the\nmanifold of the slow dynamics. However, it is necessary if we want that (4.4) is equivalent to (4.5), namely\nthat the change of variables defined by (4.6) is well defined. To see this, we can proceed as follows.\nConsider the equation\ndU\n= F (U ).\nd\u03c4\nAssume that one proceeds as in the proof of Lemma 4.2 and exploits Hypotheses 1 . . . 7 but does not exploit\nHypothesis 8. The system one eventually gets, restricted on the subspace {u\u2212 = ~0}, is\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 d\u03b6/d\u03c4 = \u03b6g1 (\u03b6, u0 , ~0)\n(4.8)\ndu0 /d\u03c4 = G01 (\u03b6, u0 )u0 \u03b6\n\uf8f3\nu\u2212 \u2261 0\nwhere g1 is the same function as in (4.26) and satisfies\n\ng1 (z, ~0, ~0) = 0 \u2200 z.\nGoing back to the original variable t, (4.8) becomes\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 d\u03b6/d\u03c4 = g1 (\u03b6, u0 , ~0)\ndu0 /d\u03c4 = G01 (\u03b6, u0 )u0\n\uf8f3\nu\u2212 \u2261 0\n27\n\n(4.9)\n\n\fThus, even if we do not assume Hypothesis 8, the equation\ndU\n= F (U )\ndt\nrestricted on the manifold of the slow dynamics {u\u2212 = ~0} is non singular. Also, one can define an invariant\ncenter manifold M00 which contains only slow dynamics.\n00\nNote,\n\u0001 however, that if Hypothesis 8 is not satisfied it may happen that for a solution U lying on M\n\u03b6 U (0) > 0 but \u03b6(U ) touches 0 in finite time. An example is the following.\nConsider the equation\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 du1 /dt = \u2212u2\ndu2 /dt = u22 (1 \u2212 u2 )\n\uf8f3\ndu3 /dt = \u2212u3 /u1\nand set\n\n\u03b6(U ) = u1\n\nF (U ) =\n\n\u2212 u1 u2 ,\n\nu1 u22 (1\n\n\u2212 u2 ), \u2212u3\n\n!T\n\n.\n\nThen Hypotheses 1, 3 . . . 7 are satisfied, but Hypothesis 8 is violated. The manifold of slow dynamics is the\nsubspace {u3 = 0} and it coincides with the center manifold M00 . Restrict to this subspace and consider\nthe equation\ndu2 /dt = u22 (1 \u2212 u2 ).\nIf 0 < u2 (0) < 1, then 0 < u2 (t) < 1 for every t. Also, du2 /dt > 0 for every t and hence u2 (0) < u2 (t) < 1\nfor every t. Since\ndu1 /dt = \u2212u2 ,\nthen by a comparison argument u1 (t) \u2264 u1 (0) \u2212 u2 (0)t for every t > 0. In other words, if u1 (0) > 0 then\nu1 (t) attains the value 0 for some t \u2264 u1 (0)/u2 (0).\n\n4.2\n\nApplications of the uniformly stable manifold to the analysis of a singular\nordinary differential equation\n\nWe first recall a preliminary result we need in the following\nLemma 4.1. Let \u03b6(\u03c4 ) be a real valued, continuous and bounded function satisfying \u03b6(\u03c4 ) > 0 for every\n\u03c4 \u2208 [0, +\u221e[. Let t(\u03c4 ) be the maximal solution of the forward Cauchy problem\n\u001a\ndt/d\u03c4 = \u03b6(\u03c4 )\n(4.10)\nt(0) = 0\nThen t(\u03c4 ) is defined on the whole interval [0, +\u221e[. Also, the following statements are equivalent:\n1. t(\u03c4 ) is a continuously differentiable diffeomorphism t : [0, +\u221e[\u2192 [0, +\u221e[.\nZ +\u221e\n2.\n\u03b6(\u03c4 )d\u03c4 = +\u221e.\n0\n\nCondition 2 guarantees, in particular, that the inverse map \u03c4 (t) is defined\n\u0001 on the whole interval [0, +\u221e[\nand that it is continuously differentiable there. Also, note that \u03b6(t) = \u03b6 \u03c4 (t) is automatically strictly bigger\nthan 0 for every t.\nBefore stating the most important result in this section we need to introduce some notations. As before,\nc > 0 denotes a positive constant satisfying Re\u03bb < \u2212c for any \u03bb which is either an eigenvalue of Gs (0, ~0, ~0)\nor an eigenvalue with strictly negative real part of of G01 (0, ~0). We denote by V 0\u2212 the subspace\n~ ~0)},\nV 0\u2212 = {(0, \u03be,\n\n28\n\n\fwhere \u03be~ \u2208 Rn0 belongs to the eigenspace of G10 (0, ~0) associated to the eigenvalues with strictly negative real\npart. Also,\n~ ~0)},\nV 00\u2212 = {(0, \u03be,\nwhere \u03be~ \u2208 Rn0 belongs to the eigenspace of G10 (0, ~0) associated to the eigenvalues with non positive real\npart. Clearly, V 0\u2212 \u2286 V 00\u2212 . With V \u2212\u2212 we denote the stable manifold:\nV \u2212\u2212 = {(0, ~0, u\u2212 ) : u\u2212 \u2208 Rn\u2212 },\nFinally, as in Section 4.1 we denote by E the manifold of equilibria {(\u03b6, ~0, ~0) : \u03b6 \u2208 R}.\nThe most important result in this section is the following:\nTheorem 4.2. Let Hypotheses 1 . . . 8 hold. If the constant \u03b4 in Hypothesis 2 is sufficiently small, then in\nthe ball with radius \u03b4 and center at the origin one can define two manifolds, Ms and Mcs , satisfying the\nfollowing properties:\n1. both Ms and Mcs are locally invariant\n\u0001 for (4.3), namely: if the initial datum lies on the manifold,\nthen the solution (\u03b6(\u03c4 ), u0 (\u03c4 ), u\u2212 (\u03c4 ) of (4.3) also lies on the manifold for |\u03c4 | sufficiently small.\n\n2. Ms is contained in Mcs .\n\n3. Ms is parameterized by E \u2295 V 0\u2212 \u2295 V \u2212\u2212 and it is tangent to this subspace at the origin. Also, Mcs is\nparameterized by E \u2295 V 00\u2212 \u2295 V \u2212\u2212 and it is tangent to this subspace at the origin.\n\u0010\n\u0011\n4. let U (\u03c4 ) = \u03b6(\u03c4 ), u0 (\u03c4 ), u\u2212 (\u03c4 ) be an orbit lying either on Ms or on Mcs and satisfying \u03b6(0) > 0.\nThen the maximal solution of the forward Cauchy problem\n\u001a\ndt/d\u03c4 = \u03b6(\u03c4 )\n(4.11)\nt(0) = 0\ndefines a continuously differentiable\n\u0001 diffeomorphism t : [0, +\u221e[\u2192 [0, +\u221e[. Let \u03c4 (t) denotes its inverse.\nThen the function U (t) = U \u03c4 (t) is a solution of (4.1) and satisfies \u03b6(t) > 0 for every t \u2265 0.\n\n5. any orbit lying on Ms can be decomposed as\n\nU (\u03c4 ) = U \u2212 (\u03c4 ) + U sl (\u03c4 ) + U p (\u03c4 ),\n\n(4.12)\n\nwhere U \u2212 (\u03c4 ) satisfies\n|U \u2212 (\u03c4 )| \u2264 k\u2212 e\u2212c\u03c4 /2|U \u2212 (0)|\n\n(4.13)\n\n~\nfor a suitable constant k\u2212 . Conversely, the component U sl (\u03c4 ) = \u03b6 sl (\u03c4 ), usl\n0 (\u03c4 ), 0 lies on the manifold\nof the slow dynamics. Also, if we use the variable t defined as the maximal solution of the Cauchy\nproblem (4.11), we have that the following property is satisfied. Denote by \u03b6 and u0 the first and the\nsecond component of U respectively. Then there exists a point (\u03b6\u221e , ~0) such that\n\u0001\nlim |\u03b6(t) \u2212 \u03b6\u221e | + |u0 (t)| ect/2 = 0.\n(4.14)\n\u0001\n\nt\u2192+\u221e\n\nFinally, the perturbation term is small in the sense that\n\n|U p (\u03c4 )| \u2264 kp |\u03b6 sl (0)||U \u2212 (0)|e\u2212c\u03c4 /4\n\n(4.15)\n\nfor a suitable constant kp > 0.\n6. any orbit U (\u03c4 ) lying on Mcs can be decomposed as\nU (\u03c4 ) = U \u2212 (\u03c4 ) + U sl (\u03c4 ) + U p (\u03c4 ),\n\n(4.16)\n\nwhere U \u2212 and U p satisfy |U \u2212 (\u03c4 )| \u2264 k\u2212 e\u2212c\u03c4 /2 |U \u2212 (0)| and |U p (\u03c4 )| \u2264 kp |\u03b6 sl (0)||U \u2212 (0)|e\u2212c\u03c4 /4 respectively. Here k\u2212 and kp denote the same constants as in (4.13) and (4.15). The component\n29\n\n\f\u0001\nU sl (\u03c4 ) = \u03b6 sl (\u03c4 ), usl (\u03c4 ), ~0 lies on the manifold of the slow dynamics. More precisely, the following holds. Consider the maximal solution of the Cauchy problem\n\u001a\ndt/d\u03c4 = \u03b6 sl (\u03c4 )\nt(0) = 0\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nand set \u03b6 sl (t) = \u03b6 sl \u03c4 (t) and usl (t) = usl \u03c4 (t) .

Indeed, as we will see in the proof, U \u2212 is a solution of (3.33) and hence does not lie\non {(0, ~0, u\u2212 )}. However, loosely speaking it can be regarded as a fast dynamic because of its exponential\ndecay.\nProof. We first define Ms .\nConsider system (4.3) restricted on the manifold of the slow dynamics. Thanks to the analysis in Section\n4.1 the variables t and \u03c4 are then equivalent. Using the variable t, we get\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 d\u03b6/dt = \u03b6G10 (\u03b6, u0 )u0\ndu0 /dt = G01 (\u03b6, u0 )u0\n(4.17)\n\uf8f3\nu\u2212 \u2261 0,\n\nThe manifold E = {(\u03b6, ~0, ~0) : \u03b6 \u2208 R} is then entirely constituted by equilibria. Applying Proposition 3.1\nto system (4.17) with S0 = E, we then obtain MEus , the uniformly stable manifold relative to E, which is\nparameterized by E \u2295 V 0\u2212 . Note that so far we have used only the variable t: MEus is a uniformly stable\nmanifold for (4.17) with respect to the variable t and by construction it is included in {u\u2212 = ~0}, a center\nmanifold for (4.3) with respect to the variable \u03c4 . The manifold Ms is then obtained exploiting the variable\n\u03c4 and applying Proposition 3.1 to system (4.3) with S0 = MEus . Also, the set\nZ0 = {(0, u0 , u\u2212 ) : u0 \u2208 Rn0 , u\u2212 \u2208 Rn\u2212 }.\nsatisfies (3.10). Properties 1, 3 and estimates (4.13) and (4.15) in the statement of Theorem 4.2 are then\nautomatically satisfied, so we are left to prove estimate (4.14) and property 4.\nTo show that estimate (4.14) holds we apply Lemma 4.1. Thanks to (4.12),\n\u03b6(\u03c4 ) = \u03b6 sl (\u03c4 ) + \u03b6 p (\u03c4 ),\n\u0001\np\n~\nwhere U sl (\u03c4 ) = \u03b6 sl (\u03c4 ), usl\n0 (\u03c4 ), 0 lies on the manifold of the slow dynamics and \u03b6 is the first component\np\nof the perturbation term U . Let t\u0303 be defined as the maximal solution of\n\u001a\ndt\u0303/d\u03c4 = \u03b6 sl (\u03c4 )\nt\u0303(0) = 0,\nThen there exits (\u03b6\u221e , ~0) such that\nlim\n\nt\u0303\u2192+\u221e\n\n\u0001 ct\u0303/2\n|\u03b6 sl (t\u0303) \u2212 \u03b6\u221e | + |usl\n= 0.\n0 (t\u0303)| e\n\n(4.18)\n\nSince |\u03b6 p (\u03c4 )| \u2264 kp \u03b4 2 e\u2212c\u03c4 /4, then for every \u03c4\n\n|t\u0303(\u03c4 ) \u2212 t(\u03c4 )| \u2264 O(1)\u03b4 2\n2 \u2212c\u03c4 /4\nwhere t(\u03c4 ) is defined by (4.11). Since also |usl\n, we conclude that (4.14) implies\n0 (\u03c4 ) \u2212 u0 (\u03c4 )| \u2264 kp \u03b4 e\n(4.18).\n\n30\n\n\f\u0001\n~\nConcering the proof of property 4, we apply Lemma 4.1. Since U sl (\u03c4 ) = \u03b6 sl (\u03c4 ), usl\n0 (\u03c4 ), 0 lies on the\nmanifold of the slow dynamics, then by the analysis in Section 4.1 it satisfies condition 1 in the statement\nof Lemma 4.1 and hence\nZ\n+\u221e\n\n\u03b6 sl (\u03c4 )d\u03c4 = +\u221e.\n\n0\n\nSince |\u03b6 p (\u03c4 )| \u2264 \u03b4 2 e\u2212c\u03c4 /4 , then\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e\n\n0\n\n\u0011\n\u03b6 sl + \u03b6 p (\u03c4 )d\u03c4 = +\u221e.\n\nApplying again Lemma 4.1 we get property 4.\nTo define the manifold Mcs we proceed as follows. Consider M cs , a center-stable manifold for (4.17).\nThis manifold is parameterized by E \u2295 V 00\u2212 and it is tangent to this space at the origin. The manifold Mcs\nis defined applying Proposition 3.1 to system (4.3) with S0 = M cs and exploiting the presence of the set\nZ0 = {(0, u0 , u\u2212 ) : u0 \u2208 Rn0 , u\u2212 \u2208 Rn\u2212 } satisfying (3.10). Proceeding as before one gets that properties\n1, 3, 4 and 6 are satisfied.\nTo verify property 2, we first observe that MEus \u2286 M cs . To obtain Ms and Mcs we applied Proposition 3.1\nto S0 = MEus and S0 = M cs respectively. Going back to the proof of Proposition 3.1 one can notice that\nthe way we constructed the uniformly stable manifold with respect to S0 is we associated to any orbit lying\non S0 the manifold constructed in Theorem 3.1. Thus the inclusion MEus \u2286 M cs has as a consequence the\ninclusion Ms \u2286 Mcs .\n\n4.3\n4.3.1\n\nProof of Proposition 4.1\nA preliminary result\n\nBefore proving Proposition 4.1, we have to introduce a preliminary result, Lemma 4.2.\nLet \u03a5 be a continuously differentiable local diffeomorphism. To simplify the exposition, we also assume\nthat \u03a5(~0) = ~0. Let \u016a := \u03a5(U ) and\n\u0001\n\u0001\nF\u0304 (\u016a ) := D\u03a5 \u1fe9\u22121 (\u016a ) F \u03a5\u22121 (\u016a )\n(4.19)\n\nIf the function U (\u03c4 ) satisfies (4.2), then \u016a (\u03c4 ) solves\n\nd\u016a\n= F\u0304 (\u016a ).\nd\u03c4\n\n(4.20)\n\nAlso, given a real valued function \u03b6(\u016a ), let\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03b6\u0304(\u016a ) := \u03b6 \u03a5\u22121 (\u016a ) .\n\n(4.21)\n\nBy direct check, one can verify that the following holds true.\n\nLemma 4.2. Assume that Hypotheses 1, 3 . . . 8 are satisfied by F and \u03b6. Also, assume that Hypothesis 2 is\nsatisfied for some \u03b4. Then Hypotheses 1, 3 . . . 8 are verified by F\u0304 and \u03b6\u0304 and there exists \u03b4\u0304, possibly smaller\nthan \u03b4, such that Hypothesis 2 is as well satisfied.\n4.3.2\n\nProof of Proposition 4.1: first part\n\nWe are now ready to prove Proposition 4.1. The proof actually relies on standard techniques, but we give it\nfor completeness. We proceed in several steps.\n\u2022 Step 1: let U = (u1 . . . uN )T be the components of U . Thanks to Hypothesis 4, \u2207\u03b6(~0) 6= ~0. Just to fix\nthe ideas, we can assume\n\u2202\u03b6 ~\n(0) 6= 0.\n\u2202u1\nBy a smooth local change of variables we can assume that \u03b6(U ) = u1 . Thanks to Lemma 4.2, Hypotheses 1 . . . 8 are satisfied by the ODE written using the new variable. To simplify the exposition,\nwe write U and \u03b6 instead of \u016a and \u03b6\u0304.\n31\n\n\f\u2022 Step 2: thanks to Hypothesis 6, there exists a manifold Meq which is entirely constituted by equilibria\nand which is transversal to the manifold S, namely to {u1 = 0}. Via a smooth local change of variables\nwe can assume that the one-dimensional subspace\nE := {\u016b2 = * * * = \u016bN = 0}\n\n(4.22)\n\nis entirely contained in Meq . Hypotheses 1 . . . 8 are satisfied in the new variables thanks to Lemma\n4.2.\n\u2022 Step 3: let E be as in (4.22) and denote by V c the eigenspace of DF (~0) associated to eigenvalues\nwith 0 real part. Also, let V \u2212\u2212 be the eigenspace associated to eigenvalues with strictly negative\nreal part. The dimension of V c and of V \u2212\u2212 is n0 + 1 and n\u2212 respectively. Thanks to Hypothesis 3,\nN = n0 + 1 + n\u2212 . The vector (1, 0 . . . 0) belongs to V c because E \u2286 V c . Also, we can assume, via a\nlinear change of variables, that\nV c = {un0 +2 = . . . uN = 0}\nFix a center manifold Mc for system\n\nV s = {\u03b6 = 0, u2 = . . . un0 +1 = 0}.\n\ndU\n= F (U )\nd\u03c4\n\n(4.23)\n\naround the equilibrium point ~0: Mc is parameterized by V c and it is tangent to this space at the\norigin ~0. Also, let Mus\nE be the uniformly stable manifold of system (4.23) relative to the manifold of\nequilibria E defined by (4.22): this manifold is paramerized by V s \u2295 E and it is tangent to this space\nat the origin. By a local smooth change of variables we can assume that actually\nMc = {un0 +2 = . . . uN = 0}\n\nMus\nE = {u2 = . . . un0 +1 = 0}.\n\nNote that the Hypotheses 1 . . . 8 are satisfied because of Lemma 4.2.\n\u2022 Step 4: consider the following decomposition:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u03b6\nf1 (\u03b6, u0 , u\u2212 )\nU = \uf8ed u0 \uf8f8\nF (U ) = \uf8ed F0 (\u03b6, u0 , u\u2212 ) \uf8f8\nu\u2212\nF\u2212 (\u03b6, u0 , u\u2212 ),\n\n(4.24)\n\nwhere \u03b6, f1 \u2208 R, u0 , F0 \u2208 Rn0 and u\u2212 , F\u2212 \u2208 Rn\u2212 . In the new coordinates, the center manifold Mc\n~\nis the subspace {u\u2212 = ~0} and the uniformly stable manifold Mus\nE is {u0 = 0}.\nThe center manifold {u\u2212 = ~0}is invariant for the equation\ndU\n= F (U )\nd\u03c4\n\n(4.25)\n\nand hence F\u2212 (\u03b6, u0 , ~0) = ~0 for every \u03b6 and u0 . By regularity,\nF\u2212 (\u03b6, u0 , u\u2212 ) = Gs (\u03b6, u0 , u\u2212 )u\u2212\nfor a suitable matrix Gs \u2208 Mn\u2212 \u00d7n\u2212 . Also, the uniformly stable manifold is invariant and hence\nproceeding as before we get that\nF0 (\u03b6, u0 , u\u2212 ) = Gc (\u03b6, u0 , u\u2212 )u0\nfor a suitable matrix Gc \u2208 Mn0 \u00d7n0 . Finally, Hypothesis 7 implies that\nf1 (0, u0 , u\u2212 ) = 0\nand hence by regularity f1 (\u03b6, u0 , u\u2212 ) = g1 (\u03b6, u0 , u\u2212 )\u03b6. Consider the decomposition\n\u0002\n\u0003\nGc (\u03b6, u0 , u\u2212 ) = Gc (\u03b6, u0 , ~0) + Gc (\u03b6, u0 , u\u2212 ) \u2212 Gc (\u03b6, u0 , ~0) .\n32\n\n\fThanks to Hypothesis 5, the subspace {\u03b6 = 0, u\u2212 = ~0} is entirely constituted by equilibria and hence\nGc (0, u0 , ~0) = ~0.\nBy regularity, Gc (\u03b6, u0 , ~0) = G01 (\u03b6, u0 )\u03b6 for a suitable matrix G01 \u2208 Mn0 \u00d7n0 . Putting all the previous\nconsiderations together, we get that system (4.25) can be written as\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nd\u03b6/d\u03c4 = g1 (\u03b6, u0 , u\u2212 )\u03b6\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nn\n\u0002\n\u0003o\n(4.26)\ndu0 /d\u03c4 = G01 (\u03b6, u0 )\u03b6 + Gc (\u03b6, u0 , u\u2212 ) \u2212 Gc (\u03b6, u0 , ~0) u0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 du\u2212 /d\u03c4 = Gs (\u03b6, u0 , u\u2212 )u\u2212\nConsider the decomposition\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\ng1 (\u03b6, u0 , u\u2212 ) = g1 (\u03b6, u0 , ~0) + g1 (\u03b6, u0 , u\u2212 ) \u2212 g1 (\u03b6, u0 , ~0)\n\nBy construction Gs (0, ~0, ~0) admits only eigenvalues with strictly negative real part, thus Gs (\u03b6, u0 , u\u2212 )u\u2212 = ~0\nimplies u\u2212 = ~0. Thus, the set {U : \u03b6(U ) = 0, F (U ) = ~0} is the subspace {\u03b6 = 0, u\u2212 = ~0}. Thanks to\nHypothesis 8, we have\ng1 (0, u0 , ~0) = 0.\nBy regularity, we thus have\ng1 (\u03b6, u0 , ~0) = g11 (\u03b6, u0 )\u03b6\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\ng1 (\u03b6, u0 , u\u2212 ) \u2212 g1 (\u03b6, u0 , ~0) = G1\u2212 (\u03b6, u0 , u\u2212 )u\u2212\n\nfor a suitable row vector G1\u2212 (\u03b6, u0 , u\u2212 ) \u2208 Rn\u2212 . Also, since the manifold {u0 = ~0, u\u2212 = ~0} is entirely\nconstituted by equilibria, then g11 (\u03b6, ~0) = 0 for every \u03b6 and hence\ng11 (\u03b6, u0 ) = G10 (\u03b6, u0 )u0\nfor a suitable vector G10 \u2208 Rn0 . In other words, (4.26) reduces to\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 d\u03b6/d\u03c4 = \u03b6 2 G10 (\u03b6, u0 )u0 + \u03b6G1\u2212 (\u03b6, u0 , u\u2212 )u\u2212\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nn\n\u0002\n\u0003o\ndu0 /d\u03c4 = G01 (\u03b6, u0 )\u03b6 + Gc (\u03b6, u0 , u\u2212 ) \u2212 Gc (\u03b6, u0 , ~0) u0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 du\u2212 /d\u03c4 = Gs (\u03b6, u0 , u\u2212 )u\u2212\n\n(4.27)\n\n\u2022 Step 5: we introduce a refined change of variables. Consider system (4.26) restricted on the invariant\nsubspace {\u03b6 = 0}. One obtains\n\uf8f1\nh\ni\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 du0 /d\u03c4 = Gc (0, u0 , u\u2212 ) \u2212 Gc (0, u0 , ~0) u0\n(4.28)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 du\u2212 /d\u03c4 = Gs (0, u0 , u\u2212 )u\u2212\nThe subspace {u\u2212 = ~0} is entirely constituted by equilibria. Also, given a point (u0 , u\u2212 ) belonging to a\nsmall enough neighbourhood of ~0, then the solution of (4.28) starting at (u0 , u\u2212 ) decays exponentially\nfast to a point in the subspace {u\u2212 = ~0}. This is a consequence of the fact that Gs (0, ~0, ~0) admits\nonly eigenvalues with strictly negative real part.\nWe can define a change of variables \u016a = \u03a54 (U ) such that in the new variables \u016a the following holds. For\u0001\nevery \u016b0 (0) \u2208 Rn0 and for every \u016b\u2212 (0) \u2208 Rn\u2212 , the solution of (4.28) starting at the point \u016b0 (0), \u016b\u2212 (0)\n\u0001\nconverges exponentially fast to the point \u016b0 (0), ~0 . In other words, the set {\u016b0 = \u016b0 (0)} is the stable\n33\n\n\f\u0001\nmanifold of system (4.28) around the equilibrium point \u016b0 (0), ~0 . Let F\u0304 (\u016a ) be defined as in (4.19),\nwith \u1fe9 = \u03a54 .
