Therefore the study of entanglement evolution of quantum systems taking into account\nthe effect of environment has become more and more\ninteresting[5\u201310]. In Ref.[8] Konrad et al. provided a\ndirect relationship between the initial and final entanglement of two qubits with one qubit subject to incoherent\ndynamics. It has been shown that given any one-sided\nquantum channel, the concurrence of output state corresponding to any initial pure input state of interest can\nalways be equivalently obtained by the product of the\nconcurrence of input state and that of the output state\nwith the maximally entangled state as an input state.\nHowever, for the two-sided quantum channel case or the\nmixed initial state case, the product of the two concurrences only provides an upper bound for the concurrence\nof interest. It is obviously important to find the exact relations of that for two-sided noisy channel case and that\nfor the mixed initial state case.\nOver the past decades, the conventionally employed\nMarkovian approximation with the assumption of an infinitely short correlation time of environment has experienced more and more challenges due to the advance of\nexperimental techniques[3]. Recent studies [11\u201325] have\nshown that non-Markovian quantum processes play an\nincreasingly important role in many fields of physics. In\norder to quantitatively study the non-Markovian dynamics, following the first computable measure of Markovianity for quantum channels introduced in Ref.[26], some\nmeasures for the degree of non-Markovianity have been\nintroduced[27, 28]. It is very interesting to investigate the\nexplicit relationship between the entanglement evolution\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: jungl@bit.edu.cn\naddress: zoujian@bit.edu.cn\n\nand the non-Markovianity.\nIn this paper, we consider the entanglement evolution\nof two qubits under local noisy channels. The main aim of\nthis work is to analyze if and to what extent can the factorization law given in Ref.[8] be generalized. As a central result, we demonstrate that for the two-sided noisy\nchannels, even when the qubits are initially prepared in\nsome mixed states, the concurrence can be expressed as\nthe products of the initial concurrence and the channels'\naction on the maximally entangled state.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Sec.II, we present\nthe model and its analytical solution. In Sec.III we give\nthe entanglement dynamics of two qubits under local,\nsingle- and two- sided non-Markovian channels. In Sec.IV\ntwo applications are given. Finally we give a conclusion\nof our results in Sec.V.\nII.\n\nTHE MODEL\n\nWe consider a system formed by two noninteracting\nparts A and B, each part consisting of a qubit s = a, b\nlocally interacting respectively with a reservoir RS =\nRA , RB . Each qubit and the corresponding reservoir are\ninitially considered independent. The dynamics of each\npart, consisting a qubit with excited state |ei and ground\nstate |gi which is coupled to a reservoir of field modes\ninitially in the vacuum state, can be represented by the\nreduced density matrix[3]\n\u0013\n\u0012 S\n\u03c1ee (0)|hS (t)|2\n\u03c1Seg (0)hS (t)\nS\n(1)\n\u03c1 (t) =\n\u03c1Sge (0)h\u2217S (t) 1 \u2212 \u03c1See (0)|hS (t)|2\nin the qubit basis {|ei, |gi}, where the superscript S =\nA, B represents part S. The function hS (t) (h(t) for\nshort) is defined as the solution of the integrodifferential equation\nZ t\nd\nh(t) = \u2212\ndt1 f (t \u2212 t1 )h(t),\n(2)\ndt\n0\nwith f (t \u2212 t1 ) denotes the two-point reservoir correlation\nfunction which can be written as the Fourier Transform\n\n\f2\nof the spectral density J(\u03c9):\nZ\nf (t \u2212 t1 ) = d\u03c9J(\u03c9) exp[i(\u03c90 \u2212 \u03c9)(t \u2212 t1 )].\n\nand the nondiagonal elements\n(3)\n\nThe exact form of h(t) thus depends on the particular\nchoice of the spectral density of the reservoir. It should\nbe noted that the dynamical map of the model can be\nMarkovian (iff |h(t)| is a monotonically decreasing function of time) and non-Markovian (iff |h(t)| increases at\nsome times)[29].\nNext, we are ready to use the reduced density matrix\nelements given in Eq.(1) to construct the reduced density\nmatrix for the two-qubit system. Following the procedure\npresented in Ref.[25], we find that in the standard product basis B = {|1i = |eei, |2i = |egi, |3i = |gei, |4i =\n|ggi, }, the diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix \u03c1(t) for the two-qubits system can be written as\n\u03c111 (t) = \u03c111 (0)|hA (t)|2 |hB (t)|2 ,\n\u03c122 (t) = |hA (t)|2 [\u03c122 (0) + \u03c111 (0)(1 \u2212 |hB (t)|2 )],\n\u03c133 (t) = |hB (t)|2 [\u03c133 (0) + \u03c111 (0)(1 \u2212 |hA (t)|2 )],\n\u03c144 (t) = 1 \u2212 (\u03c111 (t) + \u03c122 (t) + \u03c133 (t)),\n\n(4)\n\nand the nondiagonal elements are\n\u03c112 (t) = \u03c112 (0)|hA (t)|2 hB (t),\n\u03c113 (t) = \u03c113 (0)hA (t)|hB (t)|2 ,\n\u03c114 (t) = \u03c114 (0)hA (t)hB (t),\n\u03c123 (t) = \u03c123 (0)hA (t)hB (t),\n\u03c124 (t) = hA (t)[\u03c124 (0) + \u03c113 (0)(1 \u2212 |hB (t)|2 )],\n\u03c134 (t) = hB (t)[\u03c134 (0) + \u03c112 (0)(1 \u2212 |hA (t)|2 )],\n\n(5)\n\nand \u03c1ij (t) = \u03c1\u2217ji (t). We should note that if we let\nhA (t) = h(t) and hB (t) = 1, this reduced density matrix represents the dynamics of the two qubits in the\nsingle-sided channel case.\nIII.\n\nENTANGLEMENT EVOLUTION\n\nIn this section, we give the entanglement evolution for\nsingle-sided channel case (hA (t) = h(t), hB (t) = 1) and\ntwo-sided channels case for pure and mixed initial states.\nFirstly, we assume that the qubits are initially prepared\nin the pure state\n|\u03a8i = c1 |eei + c2 |egi + c3 |gei + c4 |ggi,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere ci (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) are complex and satisfy the norP4\n2\nmalization condition\ni=1 |ci | = 1. The elements of\nthe density matrix corresponding to this initial state can\nbe written as \u03c1ij (0) = ci c\u2217j , (i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4). In what\nfollows, we consider the single-sided channel case. Substituting hA (t) = h(t), hB (t) = 1 and \u03c1ij (0) = ci c\u2217j into\nEqs. (4) and (5) we obtain the diagonal elements\n\u03c111 (t) = c\u22171 c1 |h(t)|2 ,\n\u03c122 (t) = c\u22172 c2 |h(t)|2 ,\n\u03c133 (t) = c\u22173 c3 + c\u22171 c1 (1 \u2212 |h(t)|2 ),\n\u03c144 (t) = c\u22174 c4 + c\u22172 c2 (1 \u2212 |h(t)|2 ),\n\n(7)\n\n\u03c112 (t) = c1 c\u22172 |h(t)|2 ,\n\u03c113 (t) = c1 c\u22173 h(t),\n\u03c114 (t) = c1 c\u22174 h(t),\n\u03c123 (t) = c2 c\u22173 h(t),\n\u03c124 (t) = c2 c\u22174 h(t),\n\u03c134 (t) = c3 c\u22174 + c1 c\u22172 (1 \u2212 |h(t)|2 ),\n\n(8)\n\nand \u03c1ij (t) = \u03c1\u2217ji (t).\nTo quantify the entanglement we use Wootters\nconcurrence[30]. From Eqs. (7) and (8), we find that\nthe concurrence of the two qubits is\nC\u03a8 (t) = C\u03a8 (0)|h(t)|,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere C\u03a8 (0) = 2|c1 c4 \u2212 c2 c3 | is the initial entanglement\nof state (6). Equation (9) shows that the entanglement\ncan be factorized as two terms whose physical meaning is\ngiven as follows. We consider the extreme case in which\nthe two qubits are initially prepared in the maximally entangled state, i.e., C\u03a8 (0) = 1. Then equation (9) reduces\nto C\u03a8 (t) = |h(t)|, that means that |h(t)| stands for the\ntime evolution of the entanglement for the maximally entangled initial state under the single-sided channel. Then\nwe can say that the entanglement reduction under singlesided noisy channel is equal to the product of the initial\nentanglement C\u03a8 (0) and the time evolution of the entanglement for the maximally entangled initial state. That\nis, the dynamics of the entanglement is completely determined by the time evolution of the entanglement for the\ninitial state with maximal entanglement.\nThe factorization law given in Eq.(9) is valid for singlesided channel case. One may ask to what extent it can\nbe generalized to the two-sided channels case. In what\nfollows, we will show that this can be done by constraining the initial state to a certain class of states. We also\nlet the two qubits be initially prepared in the pure state\n(6). Substituting \u03c1ij (0) = ci c\u2217j into Eqs. (4) and (5) and\nafter some calculations we find that the concurrence at\ntime t is given by\nC\u03a8 (t) = max{0, Q(t)}.\n\n(10)\n\nThe explicit expression of Q(t) is\nQ(t) = C\u03a8 (0)|hA (t)||hB (t)|X ,\n(11)\n\u221a\nwhere X = 1 \u2212 |c1 |2 /|c2 c3 \u2212 c1 c4 | \u03be with \u03be = (1 \u2212\n|hA (t)|2 )(1 \u2212 |hB (t)|2 ). Equation (10) shows that for the\ncase of two-sided noisy channels, the entanglement evolution is not equal to the product of the initial entanglement C\u03a8 (0) and the maximal entanglement evolution of\nsingle-sided channel |hA (t)| and |hB (t)| but an additional\nterm X should be taken into account. We should note\nthat if for some time intervals X < 0, the entanglement\nsudden death occurs. Interestingly if we consider the case\nc1 = 0, that is, the two qubits are initially prepared in\nthe state\n|\u03a6i = c2 |egi + c3 |gei + c4 |ggi,\n\n(12)\n\n\f3\nP4\n2\nwith\ni=2 |ci | = 1, we find that X = 1 and Eq.(10)\nreduces to\n(13)\n\nwith C\u03a6 (0) = 2|c2 c3 | being the entanglement of initial\nstate (12). Equation (13) indicates that for the pure initial state (12), the entanglement evolution under twosided noisy channels is equal to the product of the initial entanglement C\u03a6 (0), |hA t| (the maximal entanglement evolution under single-sided channel A) and |hB t|\n(the maximal entanglement evolution under single-sided\nchannel B).\nAs we know, quantum mechanics and quantum information processing are not constrained to pure states. So\nwe give the generalization of the factorization law to the\nmixed state. We consider the case in which the qubits\nare initially prepared in the mixed state\n0\n\uf8ec0\n\u03c1(0) = \uf8ed\n0\n0\n\uf8eb\n\n0\nb\nz\u2217\ne\u2217\n\n0\nz\nc\nf\u2217\n\n\u03c112 (0) = 0,\n\u03c122 (0) = b,\n\u03c132 (0) = z \u2217 ,\n\u03c142 (0) = e\u2217 ,\n\n\u03c113 (0) = 0,\n\u03c123 (0) = z,\n\u03c133 (0) = c,\n\u03c143 (0) = f \u2217\n\n(14)\n\n\u03c114 (0) = 0,\n\u03c124 (0) = e,\n\u03c134 (0) = f,\n\u03c144 (0) = d.\n\nAfter some calculations we find that the concurrence at\ntime t is given by\nC\u03c1 (t) = C\u03c1 (0)|hA (t)||hB (t)|.\n\n(15)\n\nThat is the factorization law for the two-sided noisy channel case. We should note that the initial states (12) and\n(14) have a common property, that is, the number of excitations in the system is not more than one. We denote\nthese states NOE states. Then we can conclude that\nfor the two-sided noisy channels case, when the qubits\nare initially prepared in NOE states, no matter pure or\nmixed, the concurrence can be expressed as the products of initial concurrence and the channels' action on\nthe maximally entangled state.\n\nIV.\n\nC2\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\nC3\n\n0.4\n\nC4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n0\n\nt\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nFIG. 1: Dynamics of entanglement as functions of \u03b30 t.\n\n\uf8f6\n0\ne\uf8f7\nf \uf8f8\nd\n\nwhere b, c and d are real numbers and satisfy b + c +\nd = 1.

Equations (10) and (15) show the direction for entanglement\npreservation, that is, choosing appropriate parameters to\nmake the values of |hA (t)| and |hB (t)| around 1. As an\n\nexample, we investigate the detuning case of a Lorentian\nspectral density[3]\nJ(\u03c9) =\n\n1\n\u03b30 \u03bb2\n,\n2\u03c0 (\u03c90 \u2212 \u03c9 \u2212 \u2206)2 + \u03bb2\n\n(16)\n\nwhere \u2206 = \u03c90 \u2212\u03c9c is the detuning of \u03c9c and \u03c90 , and \u03c9c is\nthe center frequency of the cavity. \u03bb defines the spectral\nwidth of the reservoir and is connected to the reservoir\ncorrelation time \u03c4R = \u03bb\u22121 . \u03b30 is related to the decay of\nthe excited state of the qubit in the Markovian limit of\na flat spectrum, the relaxation time scale \u03c4S over which\nthe state of the system changes is then related to \u03b30 by\n\u03c4S = \u03b30\u22121 . We evaluate the reservoir correlation function\nf (t \u2212 t1 ) using the spectral density J(\u03c9) and obtain\nf (t \u2212 t1 ) =\n\n1\n\u03b30 \u03bb exp[\u2212(\u03bb \u2212 i\u2206)(t \u2212 t1 )].\n2\n\n(17)\n\nSolving equation (2) with this correlation function, we\nfind\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\u0015\ndt\n\u03bb \u2212 i\u2206\ndt\n\u2212 21 (\u03bb\u2212i\u2206)t\ncosh\n+\nh(t) = e\nsinh\n2\nd\n2\n(18)\np\n2\nwith d = (\u03bb \u2212 i\u2206) \u2212 2\u03b30 \u03bb. From Eq.(18) we find that\nthe value of |h(t)| is determined by the parameters \u2206 and\n\u03bb. For the two-sided channel, we denote \u2206A and \u03bbA for\nchannel A and \u2206B and \u03bbB for channel B.\nFigure 1 shows the dynamics of the entanglement as\nfunctions of \u03b30 t for different cases. In Fig.1, C1 \u221a\nis the entanglement evolution of the initial state \u03c8 = 1/ 2(|egi+\n|gei) for the single-sided channel case and C2 is that for\nthe two-sided channel case. We choose the parameters\n\u2206A = \u2206B = 0.5\u03b30 and \u03bbA = \u03bbB = 0.01\u03b30 to make\nthe values of |hA (t)| and |hB (t)| around 1. Clearly, the\nentanglement is protected well.\nIn Fig.1, we also give the entanglement evolutions\nfor\n\u221a\ntwo-sided channel case of initial state \u03c8 = 1/ 2(|egi +\n\n\f4\n\u221a\n|gei) (C3 ) and initial state \u03c6 = 1/ 2(|eei + |ggi) (C4 ).\nHere, we choose the parameters \u2206A = \u2206B = 0 and\n\u03bbA = \u03bbB = 0.01\u03b30 . Comparing C3 and C4 we find that\nfor initial state \u03c8 (NOE sate), the entanglement is always large than zero except some discrete time instants.\nThis can be understood as follows. For the NOE sates\nthe factorization law (13) is valid. The entanglement is\ndetermined by |hA (t)| and |hB (t)| of which the values are\nnot less than zero for all the parameters. However, for\nthe initial state \u03c6 (not NOE sate), the entanglement sudden death and the entanglement sudden birth can occur.\nThis can be understood from Eqs.(10) and (11) that in\nthis case X can be less than zero for some time intervals.\nThe second application is to show the connection of the\nentanglement and the non-Markovianity of the channels.\nThe measure for non-Markovianity defined in Ref. [27] is\nZ\nN = max\ndt\u03c3(t),\n(19)\n\u03c11,2 (0)\n\n\u03c3>0\n\nwhere \u03c3(t) is the rate of change of the trace distance\nwhich can be defined as\n\u03c3(t) =\n\n\u0001\nd\nD \u03c11 (t), \u03c12 (t) ,\ndt\n\n(20)\n\nwith D(\u03c11 , \u03c12 ) = 12 |\u03c11 \u2212\u03c12 | being the trace distance of the\nquantum states \u03c11 and \u03c12 . Here, D(\u03c11 , \u03c12 ) describes the\ndistinguishability between the two states and satisfying\n0 \u2264 D \u2264 1. We should note that if there exists a pair of\ninitial states and a certain time t such that \u03c3(t) > 0, the\nprocess is non-Markovian. Physically, this means that\nfor non-Markovian dynamics the distinguishability of the\npair of states increases at certain times. This can be interpreted as a flow of information from the environment\nback to the system which enhances the possibility of distinguishing the two states. Following Ref.[27], reference\n[31] presented a practical idea for directly measuring the\nnon-Markovian character of a single qubit coupled to a\nzero-temperature bosonic reservoir. It is easy to check\nthat any pair of initial states satisfying the conditions in\nthe theorem given in Ref.[31] definitely owns the same\nmaximal trace distance\n\u0001\nD \u03c11 (t), \u03c12 (t) = |h(t)|,\n(21)\n\nfind that the entanglement evolution under single-sided\nnoisy channel is equal to the product of the initial entanglment C\u03a8 (0) and the maximal trace distance |h(t)|.\nWe also know that |h(t)| also stands for the channels' action on the maximally entangled state. It is evident from\nthis relation that any increase of the entanglement implies occurring of the non-Markovian dynamics. Hence a\nconceptually simple way to quantify the degree of nonMarkovianity of an unknown quantum evolution would\nbe to compute the amount of entanglement at different\ntimes within a selected interval and check for strict monotonic decrease of the quantum correlations. This measurement has been given in the very recent paper[28].\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn summary, we have studied the entanglement dynamics of two qubits under local, single- and two-sided noisy\nchannels. We find that in the case where the initial state\nis pure, and only one of the subsystems undergoes a nonMarkovian channel, the equation of motion for entanglement presents the form of a simple factorization law \u2013the\nsecond term contains only information about how the\nmaximal entanglement is affected by the dynamics, and\nthe first term scales the second by the initial amount of\nentanglement. For more realistic scenarios, where both\nparts are influenced by the local environments, when the\nqubits are initially prepared in NOE states, no matter\npure or mixed, the concurrence can be expressed as the\nproducts of initial concurrence and the channels' action\non the maximally entangled state. Using these factorization laws we have found the way to protect entanglement\nfrom decay and given a connection of the entanglement\nand the non-Markovianity of the channels.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nnamely, |h(t)| stands for the maximal trace distance of\none part (A or B) of our model.
