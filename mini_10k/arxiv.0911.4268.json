Also, a related\nlength criterion for modules of finite length and finite projective dimension is discussed\ntowards the end.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe Frobenius endomorphism for rings of positive characteristic has been one of the central\nobjects of study in homological commutative algebra over the past decades. Not only is it a\nuseful tool in proofs of homological conjectures, but also its intrinsic homological properties\nhave been shown to have strong connections with the structure of the ring or of modules\nover it. In this article we provide several surprising connections, for example the relationship\nbetween the ability of Frobenius to detect finite projective dimension of modules and the\ntorsion part of the divisor class group.\nFirst let us review some history and notations. In 1969, Kunz characterized regular local\nrings as those for which the Frobenius endomorphism f : R \u2192 R (or equivalently some\niteration of it) is flat [23, Thm. 2.1]. Since then, a list of papers has yielded further similar\nhomological results for f , each analogous to a classical homological result concerning the\nresidue field k (viewed as an R-module via \u03c0 : R \u2192 k); see the survey article [28] for further\nn\ndetails, also [5, 20]. We will use the notation f R for R viewed as an R-module via the nth\niteration f n of f .\nFor their celebrated proof of the Intersection Theorem, Peskine and Szpiro generalized one\ndirection of Kunz's result, and shortly thereafter Herzog proved the converse, yielding the\nfollowing equivalence [30, Cor. 2], [31, Thm. 1.7], [17, Thm. 3.1]:\nDate: October 16, 2018.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification.

In particular, this would imply that the R-module f R is rigid, that is,\nthat\nn\n\nn\n\nR\nf\nf\nTorR\ni (M, R) = 0 =\u21d2 Tori+1 (M, R) = 0\n\nSeveral steps toward these goals have been made in recent years. In the general setting,\nKoh and Lee proved a finiteness result: there is a constant c(R), depending only on the ring\nfn\nR, such that vanishing of TorR\ni (M, R) for any depth R + 1 consecutive values of i > 0 and\nany one value of n \u2265 c(R) implies that M has finite projective dimension [22, Prop. 2.6].\nIn fact, they showed that depth R consecutive values of i suffice if R is Cohen-Macaulay\nof positive dimension. The best possible result ([4, 13]), however, occurs in the setting of\ncomplete intersection rings:\nTheorem 1.1. (Avramov-Miller, Dutta) Let R be a local complete intersection and M a\nfn\nfinitely generated R-module. Then the vanishing of TorR\ni (M, R) for one value each of i > 0\nand n > 0 implies that M has finite projective dimension.\nPhenomena like this can occur over non-complete intersection rings as well. In such a\nn\ncase, we call the corresponding f R strongly rigid (which is equivalent to being rigid when\nn \u2265 c(R) by Koh and Lee's result above). See Definition 2.1 and Example 2.2 ) for known\nexamples.\nn\n\nIn Section 2, we study the properties of Gorenstein local rings whose corresponding f R is\nn\nstrongly rigid. We show that if R is Gorenstein such that f R is locally strongly rigid (i.e.,\nstrongly rigid at the localization at every prime ideal), then the minimal infinite projective\ndimension locus of a module M (see Definition 2.3) must be contained in the set of associated primes of F n (M) (see Theorem 2.5). One consequence of this result is the following\ncharacterization for modules of finite projective dimension:\nn\n\nCorollary 2.6 Let R be Gorenstein local ring such that f R is locally strongly rigid for\nsome n > 0 and M an R-module. Then M has finite projective dimension if and only if\nAss F n (M) is contained in the finite projective dimension locus of M.\nn\n\nNote that the class of rings such that f R is locally strongly rigid for all n > 0 includes,\nbut is strictly bigger than, the class of all local complete intersections, see Example 2.2.\nWe also apply Theorem 2.5 to prove that the divisor class groups of certain Gorenstein\ndomains have no p-torsion.\nn\n\nTheorem 2.9 Let R be a Gorenstein local ring such that f R is locally strongly rigid for some\nn > 0. Let I be an reflexive ideal such that I is locally free in codimension 2. Furthermore,\nassume that HomR (I, I) \u223c\n= R. Let q = pn . Then if I (q) satisfies Serre's condition (S3 ), I\nmust be principal. In particular, the Picard group of the punctured spectrum of R has no\np-torsion. In particular, if R satisfies condition (R2 ), Cl(R) has no p-torsion.\n\n\fON THE (NON)RIGIDITY OF THE FROBENIUS ENDOMORPHISM OVER GORENSTEIN RINGS\n\n3\n\nIn particular, the theorem above shows that the Picard groups of the punctured spectrum\nof complete intersection rings cannot have p-torsion. For complete intersections in projective\nspaces, such a result was first proved by Deligne in SGA 7 (Theorem 1.8, [10]) using sophisticated geometric machinery. We also note that this particular case confirms the positive\ncharacteristic case of the following conjecture we learned from [16]:\nConjecture 1.2. (Gabber) Let (R, m) be a local complete intersection ring of dimension 3.\nLet UR = Spec(R) \u2212 {m} be the punctured spectrum of R. Then Pic(UR ) is torsion-free.\nIt was implied in [16] that the positive characteristic case is known, but we cannot find a\nprecise reference. In any case, it is worth noting that our proof is purely homological and\nquite simple.\nIn Section 3, we push the ideas in the previous section further to construct many examn\nples of Gorenstein local rings R such that f R is not strongly rigid. In other words, the\nn\nf\nvanishing of TorR\ni (M, R) for just one value each of i > 0 and n > 0 is not sufficient to\nconclude that M has finite projective dimension. Two different approaches are used in these\nconstructions. The first approach boils down to finding an isolated Gorenstein singularity\nwith torsion class group and applying Theorem 2.9 above; see Example 3.2. The second\napproach takes a different route via Lemma 3.3. Obtaining an actual example requires some\nexplicit computations on the determinantal ring of 2 by 2 minors in 9 variables and hence\nis less general than the first approach; see Example 3.5. The bonus is, however, that these\nhave a torsion-free class group.\nIn Section 4, we study the connection between (strong) rigidity and numerical rigidity (see\nDefinitions 4.1 and 4.2) of the Frobenius endomorphism. The main result we prove there is\nTheorem 4.6 Let R be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring with isolated singularity and of positive\nn\ndimension. Fix some n > 0. If for every nonzerodivisor y \u2208 R, f (R/yR) is numerically\nn\nrigid, then f R is strongly rigid against modules of dimension up to one.\nThe rest of the introduction contains a review of the notation and definitions used throughout the paper. We assume throughout that R is a commutative Noetherian local ring of prime\ncharacteristic p > 0 and that all R-modules M and N are finitely generated. The Frobenius\nendomorphism f : R \u2192 R is defined by f (r) = r p for r \u2208 R; its self-compositions are given by\nn\nf n (r) = r p . Restriction of scalars along each iteration f n endows R with a new R-module\nn\nstructure, denoted by f R.\nThe Frobenius functor, introduced by Peskine and Szpiro in [31], is given by base change\nalong the Frobenius endomorphism: FR (M) = M \u2297R fR for any R-module M. Its composin\ntions are given by FRn (M) = M \u2297R f R, namely base change along the compositions f n of f .\nWe omit the subscript R if there is no ambiguity about R. Note particularly that the module\nstructure on F n (M) is via usual multiplication in R on the right hand factor of the tensor\nfn\nproduct. The values of the derived functors TorR\ni (M, R) are similarly viewed as R-modules\nvia the target of the base change map f n .\nIt is easy to verify that F n (R) \u223c\n= R/I [q] , where\n= R and that for cyclic modules F n (R/I) \u223c\nq = pn and I [q] denotes the ideal generated by the q-th powers of the generators of I. For\nconvenience, we frequently use q to denote the power pn , which may vary.\n\n\f4\n\nHAILONG DAO, JINJIA LI, AND CLAUDIA MILLER\n\nIn the sequel, we use l(M) and pd M to denote the length and projective dimension,\nrespectively, of the module M. By codimension of M, we mean dim R \u2212 dim M. We use the\nnotation x for a sequence of elements of R and often write simply R/x for R/(x) to save\nspace. Likewise, xq denotes the ideal generated by the qth powers of the sequence x, not the\nqth power of the ideal x.\n2. Strong rigidity of Frobenius and torsion elements in divisor class\ngroups\nIn this section we investigate the consequences of the phenomenon that over certain rings\nthe Frobenius map can be used to test for finite projective dimension (e.g., over complete\nintersection rings). This work enables us to prove strong results about torsion elements in the\nclass groups of complete intersection rings and also allows us to construct counterexamples\nto such phenomena over non-complete intersection rings. We begin with some convenient\ndefinitions to facilitate the discussion.\nDefinition 2.1. An R-module N is called strongly rigid if for any integer i and any finitely\ngenerated R-module M, TorR\ni (M, N) = 0 implies pdR M < \u221e. The module N is called\nlocally strongly rigid if Np is strongly rigid for all p \u2208 Spec R.\nn\n\nExample 2.2. If R is a local complete intersection ring, then f R is locally strongly rigid\nfor all n, see Theorem 1.1. For any local Cohen-Macaulay ring R of dimension at most 1,\nn\nthere is a number c(R) such that for any n \u2265 c(R), f R is strongly rigid by virtue of Koh\nand Lee's result mentioned in the introduction. In particular, when (R, m) is Artinian and\nn\nm[p] = 0, then f R is (locally) strongly rigid for all n, cf. [28, 2.2.8].\nWe also cite the following definition (see, for example, [11]):\nDefinition 2.3. Let M be an R-module. One defines the infinite projective dimension locus\nof M as\nIPD(M) = {p \u2208 Spec R| pdRp Mp = \u221e}\nSimilarly, define FPD(M) to be the finite projective dimension locus of M. Finally, we define\nthe n-strong rigidity locus of R as\nn\n\nSRn (R) = {p \u2208 Spec R|, f Rp is strongly rigid}\nThe following standard facts, which we state without proof, will be used frequently:\nFact 2.4. Let f : R \u2192 S be a ring homomorphism and p a prime ideal of S. Then for each\ni \u2265 0 and R-module M there is a natural isomorphism\nRf \u20131(p)\n\u223c\nTorR\n(Mf \u20131(p) , Sp )\ni (M, S)p = Tori\n\nFurthermore, if f is the Frobenius endomorphism of R, then f \u20131(p) = p and Rf \u20131(p) \u2192 Sp is\nthe Frobenius endomorphism of Rp .\nTheorem 2.5. Let R be a Gorenstein local ring and M an R-module. Then\nmin IPD(M) \u2229 SRn (R) \u2286 Ass F n (M)\n\n\fON THE (NON)RIGIDITY OF THE FROBENIUS ENDOMORPHISM OVER GORENSTEIN RINGS\n\n5\n\nn\n\nIn particular, if f R is locally strongly rigid, then\nmin IPD(M) \u2286 Ass F n (M)\nProof. Since R is Gorenstein, by the Cohen-Macaulay approximation due to Auslander and\nBuchweitz [3, 1.8], there is a short exact sequence\n0 \u2192 M \u2192 Q \u2192 N \u2192 0,\nwhere pd Q < \u221e and N is maximal Cohen-Macaulay. Tensoring with the Frobenius endomorphism, we have an embedding\nn\n\nf\nn\n0 \u2192 TorR\n1 (N, R) \u2192 F (M).\n\n(2.1)\n\nn\n\nTake any p \u2208 min IPD(M) \u2229 SRn (R); then pdRp Mp = \u221e and f Rp is strongly rigid. It\nn\nR\nfollows that pdRp Np = \u221e and therefore that Tor1 p (Np , f Rp ) 6= 0. On the other hand, since p\nis minimal in the infinite projective dimension locus of M, pdRq Mq < \u221e for any prime q ( p,\nn\nn\nR\nR\nwhence pdRq Nq < \u221e and so Tor1 q (Nq , f Rq ) = 0. Therefore, the length of Tor1 p (Np , f Rp )\nmust be finite.\nLocalizing (2.1) at p, we have an exact sequence\nR\n\nn\n\n0 \u2192 Tor1 p (Np , f Rp ) \u2192 F n (M)p .\nThis implies that depth F n (M)p = 0. Hence p \u2208 Ass F n (M).\n\n\u0003\nfn\n\nCorollary 2.6. Let R be a Gorenstein local ring such that R is locally strongly rigid for\nsome n > 0 and M an R-module. The following are equivalent:\n(1) M has finite projective dimension;\n(2) Ass F n (M) \u2286 FPD(M).\nAs an immediate consequence, we obtain the following special case with simpler hypotheses. Here, Sing(R) denotes the singular locus of R. Note particularly that the hypothesis\n(min Supp M) \u2229 Sing(R) = \u2205 holds, for example, when dim M > dim Sing(R).\nn\n\nCorollary 2.7. Let R be a Gorenstein local ring such that f R is locally strongly rigid for\nsome n > 0 (e.g., if R is a local complete intersection) and M an R-module such that\n(min Supp M)\u2229Sing(R) = \u2205. If F n (M) has no embedded primes, then M has finite projective\ndimension. In particular, if F n (M) is Cohen-Macaulay, then M is perfect.\nProof. It suffices to note that\nAss F n (M) = min Supp F n (M) = min Supp M \u2286 Spec R\\ Sing(R) \u2286 FPD(M)\nwhere the first equality is by the assumption that F n (M) has no embedded primes, the\nsecond is well-known (see [31], for example) and the first containment follows from the\nhypothesis.\n\u0003\nRemark 2.8. If R is reduced, we do not know if the condition \"(min Supp M) \u2229 Sing(R) = \u2205\"\nin Corollary 2.7 can be replaced by the simpler condition \"dim M > 0\". However, this is\nimpossible when R is not reduced (see [28, 2.1.7], for example).\n\n\f6\n\nHAILONG DAO, JINJIA LI, AND CLAUDIA MILLER\n\nWe now give an application of Theorem 2.5 to divisor class groups. In the sequel, we use\nCl(R) to denote the divisor class group of R. We refer to [15] for the definition and basic\nfacts about Cl(R) and the Picard groups and to [7] for Serre's conditions (Rn ) and (Sn ).\nn\n\nTheorem 2.9. Let R be a Gorenstein local ring such that f R is locally strongly rigid for some\nn > 0. Let I be an reflexive ideal such that I is locally free in codimension 2. Furthermore,\nassume that HomR (I, I) \u223c\n= R. Let q = pn . Then if I (q) satisfies Serre's condition (S3 ), I\nmust be principal. In particular, the Picard group of the punctured spectrum of R has no\np-torsion. If, furthermore, R satisfies condition (R2 ), then Cl(R) has no p-torsion.\nProof. We may assume dim R \u2265 3. Assume that I is not principal, then it follows that\npd I = \u221e (see [9, Corollary 11][8, Chapter VII, \u00a74, no. 7, Corollary 2]). We claim that one\ncan always write I = (a) : (b) for a, b \u2208 R. Here is a quick proof: choose a such that a\ngenerates I at the minimal primes of I. Pick an irredundant primary decomposition of (a);\nit can be written as I \u2229 J (if I = (a) we are done). Choosing b in J but not in any minimal\nprime of I, one can show that I = (a) : (b). By the short exact sequence\nb\n\n0 \u2192 R/(a : b) \u2192 R/(a) \u2192 R/(a, b) \u2192 0\nwe have IPD(I) = IPD(R/(a, b)). Thus, for any p \u2208 min IPD(I),\np \u2208 min IPD(R/(a, b))\nand so by Theorem 2.5,\np \u2208 Ass(F n (R/(a, b))) = Ass(R/(aq , bq ))\nLocalize the short exact sequence\n0 \u2192 R/(aq : bq ) \u2192 R/(aq ) \u2192 R/(aq , bq ) \u2192 0\nat p, and observe that (aq : bq ) = I (q) . From the fact that\ndepth(R/(aq , bq ))p = 0\n(q)\n\nwe get that depth Ip \u2264 2. On the other hand, since I is locally free in codimension 2,\ndim Rp \u2265 3. So, I (q) does not satisfy (S3 ), and our first assertion is proved. The last two\nstatements follow immediately (note that if R is (R2 ) then R is automatically normal). \u0003\nAs a corollary we can recover a notable result about torsion elements in the Picard groups\nof complete intersections.\nCorollary 2.10. Let R be an equicharacteristic local complete intersection ring of dimension at least 3. Then the Picard group of the punctured spectrum of R is torsion-free. If,\nfurthermore, R satisfies condition (R2 ), then the class group of R is torsion-free.\nLet X be a complete intersection variety of dimension at least 2 in the projective space\nover a field. The Picard group of X modulo the hyperplane section is torsion-free.\nProof. Let p be the characteristic exponent of R (so it is 1 if the characteristic of R is 0).\nThe fact that the Picard group or Cl(R) has no element whose order is relatively prime to p\nwas well-known, see [32]. Theorem 2.9 takes care of the p-torsion elements. The second half\nof the corollary follows by applying the first to the local ring at the origin of the affine cone\nover X.\n\u0003\n\n\fON THE (NON)RIGIDITY OF THE FROBENIUS ENDOMORPHISM OVER GORENSTEIN RINGS\n\n7\n\nRemark 2.11. The second half of the corollary was first proved by Deligne [10], and another\nproof was given by B\u01cedescu [6, Theorem B]. As far as we know, ours is the first algebraic\nproof.\nExample 2.12. The conditions dim R \u2265 3 and (R2 ) in the corollary cannot be weakened.\nLet R = k[[x, y, z]]/(xy \u2212 z 2 ) where k is an algebraically closed field of characteristic other\nthan 2. Then dim R = 2 and R is regular in codimension 1, but Cl(R) \u223c\n= Z/(2) (see, for\nexample, Proposition 11.4 of [15]).\n3. Examples of nonrigidity\nIn this section we construct plenty of examples of a Gorenstein ring R in positive charn\nacteristic such that f R is not (strongly) rigid. This is in stark contrast to the situation\nn\nfor complete intersection rings, where the strong rigidity of f R is known to hold. Our constructions take two completely different approaches. The first approach (see Example 3.2)\nprovides the desired examples with torsion divisor class groups. This can be viewed as a natural consequence of Theorem 2.9. The second approach (see Example 3.5), on the contrary,\nprovides the desired examples with torsion-free divisor class groups.\nFirst we isolate a consequence of Theorem 2.9:\nCorollary 3.1. Let R be a local, Gorenstein domain with isolated singularity. Suppose that\nn\ndim R \u2265 3 and Cl(R) has a torsion element of order l that satisfies (S3 ). Then f R is not\nn\nstrongly rigid for any n such that pn \u2261 1 or 0 modulo l. In particular, if l = 2, then f R is\nnot strongly rigid for any n and not rigid for n \u226b 0.\nProof. Let I be a reflexive ideal which represents an l-torsion element in Cl(R) and q = pn .\nThen the ideal J = I (q) is isomorphic to I or R, both of which satisfy (S3 ), contradicting\nTheorem 2.9. When l = 2, for any n, q = pn is congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 2. The last\nstatement follows from Example 2.2.\n\u0003\nExample 3.2. It is not hard to find examples of isolated Gorenstein singularities with torsion\nclass group. Let S = k[x1 , * * * , xd ] and l be an integer. Let T be the l-Veronese subring of\nS and R be the local ring at the homogeneous maximal ideal of T . Then one can show\nthat Cl(R) = Cl(T ) = Z/(l) using Theorem 1.6 of [34]. The ring R obviously has isolated\nsingularity, as it is the local ring at the origin of the cone over a smooth projective variety.\nAlso, R will be Gorenstein as long as l | d. Finally, let I represent the generator of Cl(T ).\nIt is easy to see that the cyclic cover of T corresponding to I is S, so I, and therefore the\ngenerator of Cl(R), is Cohen-Macaulay. In particular, it will be (S3 ). So all of the conditions\nof Corollary 3.1 can be satisfied easily.\nFor the rest of this section we will take another approach to construct examples of nonrigidity in which the rings have torsion-free divisor class groups. The following result gives\na general technique for finding such examples:\nLemma 3.3. Let (R, m) be a Gorenstein ring with isolated singularity and positive dimension. The following are equivalent:\nn\n(1) f R is strongly rigid.\n(2) For any R-module L with infinite projective dimension, depth F n (L) = 0\n\n\f8\n\nHAILONG DAO, JINJIA LI, AND CLAUDIA MILLER\n\nProof of Lemma 3.3. Assume (1). Then (2) is a consequence of Corollary 2.6. Now assume (2). Let L be a module of infinite projective dimension. It is enough to prove that\nfn\nTorR\n1 (L, R) 6= 0. Consider the exact sequence\n0 \u2192 L1 \u2192 Q \u2192 L \u2192 0\nn\n\nf\nwhere Q is free and L1 is the first syzygy of L. If TorR\n1 (L, R) = 0, then by tensoring with\nfn\nR one get\n0 \u2192 F n (L1 ) \u2192 Q \u2192 F n (L) \u2192 0.\nBut since pdR L = pdR L1 = \u221e, one has depth F n (L1 ) = depth F n (L) = 0. Since depth Q =\ndim Q > 0, this is a contradiction.\n\u0003\n\nWe also need the following crucial observation.\nLemma 3.4. Let k be a field of characteristic p > 0. Let A denote the determinantal\nring k[X]/I2 where X = (Xij ) is a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix of indeterminates and I2 is the ideal of\nk[X] generated by all the 2 \u00d7 2 minors of X. Let xij denote the images of Xij in A. Let\nL = A/(x11 , x12 ). Then depth F n (L) > 0 for all n > 0 and pd L = \u221e.\nProof. Let \u03b4ij denote the minors of X corresponding to Xij and I be the ideal of k[X]\nn\nn\ngenerated by X11\n, X12\nand all the \u03b4ij 's. We prove that for any field k (we do not need\nto assume that k has prime characteristic!) and any n \u2265 2, x33 is a nonzerodivisor for\nA/(xn11 , xn12 ) \u223c\n= k[X]/I. In the following paragraph, we refer the reader to [14, 15.2-4] for\nnotations and terminologies regarding Gr\u00f6bner basis.\nWe fix a reverse lexicographic order > on the monomials such that\nX11 > X12 > X13 > X21 > X22 > X23 > X31 > X32 > X33\nUsing Buchberger's Algorithm, one can produce a Gr\u00f6bner basis for I consisting of all the\nn\u2212l s\nn\nn\nl\nt\n\u03b4ij 's, X11\n, X12\nand all the monomials of the form X11\nX12\nX22 X32\nwhere l runs through\n1, 2, ..., n \u2212 1 and s, t run through all positive integers such that s + t = l. Therefore the\ninitial ideal of I (henceforth in(I)) does not contain any monomial divisible by X33 . Assume\nfor some g \u2208 k[X], X33 g \u2208 I. Let g0 be the remainder of g (with respect to the generators\nof I) in a standard expression obtained by performing the division algorithm. If g0 6= 0, then\nX33 g0 6= 0 since k[X] is a domain. On the other hand, since X33 g0 \u2208 I, at least one of the\nmonomials of X33 g0 is in in(I). Thus, at least one of the monomials of g0 is in in(I). This\ncontradicts the fact that g0 is a nonzero remainder. Thus g0 = 0 and g \u2208 I. It follows that\nx33 is a nonzerodivisor for k[X]/I.\nFinally, we show pd L = \u221e. Assume that pd L < \u221e, i.e., the ideal (x11 , x12 ) is of finite\nprojective dimension. By a result of MacRae [26, Cor. 4.4], two-generated ideals of finite\nprojective dimension have the form a(b, c), where a is a nonzerodivisor and b, c form a regular\nsequence. But if (x11 , x12 ) = a(b, c) for such a, b and c, since the degree of x11 is one, a is\nforced to be a unit (otherwise, (x11 , x12 ) would be a principal ideal which is impossible).\nTherefore (x11 , x12 ) = (b, c). But since x11 x22 \u2212 x21 x12 = 0, (x11 , x12 ) cannot be an ideal\ngenerated by a regular sequence of two elements. This is a contradiction.\n\u0003\nCombining the two lemmas above, we get the following example. Note that the divisor\nclass group of the ring in this example is isomorphic to Z [7, 7.3.5], which is torsion-free.\n\n\fON THE (NON)RIGIDITY OF THE FROBENIUS ENDOMORPHISM OVER GORENSTEIN RINGS\n\n9\n\nExample 3.5. Let R be the localization of the determinantal ring A as in Lemma 3.4 with\nn\nrespect to the maximal ideal (X). Then f R is not strongly rigid for any n.\nRemark 3.6. In view of Koh-Lee's theorem mentioned in the Introduction, Example 3.5\nn\nimmediately yields the nonrigidity of f R for any n \u2265 c(R) (cf. Example 2.2). But in fact,\nwith a little further computation, the reader can check that this example yields nonrigidity for\nall n > 0: indeed, the module N of infinite projective dimension constructed in Theorem 2.5\nfn\nby taking for the module M the module L of Lemma 3.4 satisfies TorR\n1 (N, R) = 0 by the\nn\nf\nargument in the proof, but it can be shown that in fact TorR\n6= 0.\n2 (N, R)\nfn\nWe point out that we do not know of any example showing that R is not (strongly) rigid\nwhen dim R = 0 or against a module M of finite length. See, however, the discussion at the\nend of Section 4.\n4. Some further observations\nThroughout this section, d will always be the dimension of the ring and n always denotes\nsome positive integer. We know from the previous section that R could fail to be strongly\nrigid when the ring R is no longer complete intersection. However, we still hope that to some\nextent such a property could hold over non-complete intersection rings. In particular, we do\nn\nnot know any example showing that f R is not rigid when dim R = 0 or against a module M\nof finite length.\nWe first make two more definitions, the first of which is just a refinement of the definition\nn\nof strongly rigidity of f R.\nn\n\nDefinition 4.1. Let h be a nonnegative integer. f R is called strongly rigid against modules\nof dimension at most h, if for any integer i and any finitely generated module M of dimension\nfn\nat most h, TorR\ni (M, R) = 0 implies pdR M < \u221e.\nn\n\nDefinition 4.2. f R is called numerically rigid if for any R-module M of finite length,\nl(F n (M)) = pnd l(M) implies pdR M < \u221e.\nThe second definition above is motivated by the following characterization for modules of\nfinite projective dimension and finite length over complete intersection rings.\nTheorem [12, 28] Let R be a complete intersection ring in characteristic p and M an Rmodule of finite length. Then the following are equivalent:\n(1) M has finite projective dimension,\n(2) l(F n (M)) = pnd l(M) for all n > 0,\n(3) l(F n (M)) = pnd l(M) for some n > 0.\nThe implication (3)\u21d2(1) in the above theorem simply says that if R is a complete inn\ntersection ring, then f R is numerically rigid for any n. When R is no longer a complete\nn\nintersection ring, it is an open question whether f R could still be numerically rigid1. In fact,\nsuch a question is closely related to the rigidity question discussed earlier in this paper. The\ngoal of this section is to explore the connections between them.\n1the\n\nimplication (1)\u21d2(2) in the theorem fails even over Gorenstein rings, see [29]\n\n\f10\n\nHAILONG DAO, JINJIA LI, AND CLAUDIA MILLER\n\nThe following technical result plays a crucial role here. Recall that if l(M \u2297 N) < \u221e and\ndef Ppd N\nR\nj\npd N < \u221e, then \u03c7(M, N) =\nj=0 (\u22121) l(Torj (M, N)).\nProposition 4.3. Let R be a Noetherian local Cohen-Macaulay ring of positive dimension\nand of characteristic p > 0. Let M be an R-module of codimension c. Suppose dim M > 0\nand Rp is a complete intersection ring for every minimal prime p of M. Then\nn\nl(FR/x\n(M/xM)) \u2265 q c \u03c7(M, R/x), \u2200n > 0,\n\nfor any s.o.p. x of F n (M) which is also R-regular. Moreover, equality holds for some n > 0\nif and only if: (1) F n (M) is Cohen-Macaulay and (2) for every minimal prime p of M,\npdRp Mp < \u221e.\nFor the proof the properties of the higher Euler characteristics of Koszul complexes are\nused in an essential way. We recall some terms and results here.\nFor a pair of modules M, N such that l(M \u2297 N) < \u221e and pd N < \u221e, the ith higher\nEuler characteristic is defined by the following formula\nX\n\npd N\n\n\u03c7i (M, N) =\n\n(\u22121)j\u2212i l(TorR\nj (M, N)).\n\nj=i\n\nBy convention, \u03c7(M, N) = \u03c70 (M, N). Some standard facts about \u03c7 and \u03c7i can be found\nin [25, 33]. In this paper, we particularly need the following two well-known results due to\nSerre and Lichtenbaum [25, Lemma 1 and Theorem 1], [33].\nLemma 4.4. Let M be an R-module and x = {x1 , x2 , ..., xc } an R-sequence such that\nl(M/xM) < \u221e. Then \u03c7(M, R/x) \u2265 0, with the equality holding if and only if dim M < c.\nTheorem 4.5. Let M be an R-module and x an R-sequence such that l(M/xM) < \u221e. Then\nfor any i > 0, \u03c7i (M, R/x) \u2265 0, with the equality holding if and only if Tori (M, R/x) = 0\n(and hence Torj (M, R/x) = 0 for all j \u2265 i).\nProof of Proposition 4.3. Since Supp M = Supp F n (M) (see [31]), min Supp F n (M) = min Supp M.\nWe have\nn\n(M/xM)) = l(F n (M) \u2297R R/x)\nl(FR/x\n\n\u2265 \u03c7(F n (M), R/x)\nX\n=\nl(F n (M)p )\u03c7(R/p, R/x)\np\u2208min Supp M\n\n=\n\nX\n\nl(FRnp (Mp ))\u03c7(R/p, R/x)\n\np\u2208min Supp M\n\n\u2265\n\nX\n\nq c l(Mp )\u03c7(R/p, R/x)\n\np\u2208min Supp M\nc\n\n= q \u03c7(M, R/x)\nwhere the first inequality holds since \u03c71 (F n (M), R/x) \u2265 0 by Theorem 4.5, the second\nand fourth equalities by Lemma 4.4, and the second inequality is a result over complete\nintersection rings [12, Thm. 1.9] (note that Rp is complete intersection by the hypotheses).\n\n\fON THE (NON)RIGIDITY OF THE FROBENIUS ENDOMORPHISM OVER GORENSTEIN RINGS\n\n11\n\nTherefore, furthermore, equality holds if and only if \u03c71 (F n (M), R/x) = 0 and l(FRnp (Mp )) =\nq c l(Mp ) for every minimal prime p of M. The former is equivalent to F n (M) being CohenMacaulay by Theorem 4.5 and the latter is equivalent to Mp having finite projective dimension over Rp by [28, Thm. 5.2.2] since Rp is complete intersection.\n\u0003\nTheorem 4.6. Let R be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring with isolated singularity and of positive\nn\ndimension. Fix some n > 0. If for every nonzerodivisor y \u2208 R, f (R/yR) is numerically\nn\nrigid, then f R is strongly rigid against modules of dimension at most one.\nn\n\nProof. Let M be an R-module of dimension at most one. Assume f (R/yR) is numerically\nn\nrigid for every nonzerodivisor y \u2208 R. We want to prove that for any i > 0, Tori (M, f R) = 0\nimplies pd M < \u221e. Let x = {x1 , ..., xd\u22121 } be an R-sequence contained in Ann M. We may\nassume that i = 1 by replacing M by its (i \u2212 1)th syzygy over the ring R/(x1 , ..., xd\u22121 ) and\nn\nusing that Tori (R/(x1 , ..., xd\u22121 ), f R) = 0 for all i > 0 as pdR R/(x1 , ..., xd\u22121 ) < \u221e.\nLetting K be the first syzygy of M as an R/(x1 , ..., xd\u22121 )-module, we get a short exact\nsequence\n0 \u2192 F n (K) \u2192 F n ((R/(x1 , ..., xd\u22121 ))t ) \u2192 F n (M) \u2192 0.\nIt follows that F n (K) is a Cohen-Macaulay module of dimension one. Hence by Proposin\ntion 4.3 (note that R has isolated singularity), one has l(FR/yR\n(K/yK)) = q d\u22121 \u03c7(K, R/yR)\nn\nfor every y \u2208 R which is regular on both K and R. Therefore, l(FR/yR\n(K/yK)) =\nd\u22121\nfn\nq l(K/yK). Since we assume (R/yR) is numerically rigid, K/yK has finite projective\ndimension over R/yR. Thus K has finite projective dimension over R, whence M does too\nby the long exact sequence of Tors against the residue field k.\n\u0003\nRemark 4.7. For the determinantal ring R = k[X]/I2 used in Section 3, it was shown there\nn\nthat f R is not strongly rigid against modules of dimension at most 5 for any n. In fact, we\ncan also modify the example a little bit to show that it is not strongly rigid against modules\nn\nof dimension at most 3. For k of arbitrary characteristic though, we do not know if f R is\nstrongly rigid against modules of dimension at most 0, 1, or 2. However, in characteristic 2\n1\nwe have an example which shows that f R is not strongly rigid against modules of dimension\n1. In fact, if we set k = Z/2Z and take the module N = R/(x12 , x13 , x21 , x23 , x31 , x32 ), then\nit is easy to check that dim N = 1, depth F (N) = 1 and pd N = \u221e. Taking an R-sequence\nx1 , x2 , x3 , x4 contained in the annihilator of N and embedding N into a module of finite projective dimension over R/(x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ) (via the Auslander-Buchweitz short exact sequence\nagain), the cokernel of this embedding gives such an example. Therefore, by Theorem 4.6, we\nalso obtain an example of Gorenstein ring R in characteristic 2 for which the corresponding\n1\nR-module f R is not numerically rigid.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank Craig Huneke for crucial remarks which connected our works and Srikanth Iyengar who carefully read an earlier version of this manuscript and suggested a better statement\nfor Corollary 2.6.
