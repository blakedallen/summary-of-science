However, recently a new class of wormholes has been introduced by Eiroa\nand Simeone [2]. They avoid the usual exotic matter requirements for wormholes by\nrequiring only that the geodesics restricted to a plane normal to the symmetry axis flare\nout, as proposed in [3], rather than that all geodesics flare out. This allows them to have\neverywhere positive energy density for this type of wormhole, and they are thus\npotentially constructible. The goal of this paper is to establish how close these metrics\ncan be to ones constructed from ordinary charged matter.\nThe general form of the metric considered is given by [4]\n\nds 2 \uf03d \uf0722m H 2 \uf028d\uf0722 \uf02b dz 2 \uf029 \uf02b \uf0722 H 2 d\uf06a2 \uf02d H \uf02d2 dt 2\n\n(1)\n\nH \uf03d k1\uf072 m \uf02b k 2\uf072 \uf02d m\n\n(2)\n\n2\n\nwith\n\n*\n\ne-mail: ron.lenk@reliabulb.com\n\n\fwith k1, k2 and m real, but not necessarily positive, constants. The units of k1 are length1/m\nand of k2 are lengthm, so that H is dimensionless. To construct the wormhole, the volume\ninside a ball of radius a is excised from both of two copies of this metric, and the two\nboundaries at \uf072 = a are glued together to form a wormhole with throat radius a.\nThis will represent a positive energy wormhole if the two conditions\n\n\uf028\n\uf028k a\n\n\uf05d\n\uf029\uf05b\n\uf029 \uf05b\uf0281 \uf02b m\uf029 k a \uf02b \uf0281 \uf02d m\uf029 k a \uf05d \uf03c 0\n\n2a k1a m \uf02b k 2 a \uf02d m \uf0281 \uf02b m \uf029k1a m \uf02b \uf0281 \uf02d m \uf029k 2 a \uf02d m \uf03e 0\n2\n\n2a 2m \uf02b1\n\n1\n\nm\n\n\uf02b k2 a \uf02d m\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\nm\n\n1\n\n(3a)\n\n\uf02dm\n\n2\n\n(3b)\n\nare met. As shown in Ref. [2], a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for the second\ninequality to be satisfied is for m \uf03c 1, which we will assume from now on.\n\nThe stress-energy tensor for Eq. (1) is\n\nT\uf06e\uf06d \uf03d \uf02d8\uf070diag \uf028Q, Q,\uf02dQ,\uf02dQ \uf029\n\nQ\uf03d\n\nk1k 2 m 2\n2\uf070H 4\uf072 2 m\n\n2\n\n(4)\n\n\uf02b2\n\nin units with G = c = 1. It is trace-free, as appropriate for a massless field. We want this to\napproximate as closely as possible the stress-energy tensor for a charged line-source.\nSince for a charged line E = 2\uf06c / \uf072\uf02c\uf020with \uf06c the line charge density, the stress-energy\ntensor is as in Eq. (4), with\n\nQCL\n\n\uf06c2\n\uf03d\uf02d\n2\uf070\uf072 2\n\n(5)\n\nExpanding the denominator of Q in Eq. (4), we find five terms in differing powers of \uf072,\nwith numerical factors that sum to 16. We select\n\nk1k 2 m 2 \uf03d \uf02d16\uf06c2\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the extra factor of 16 is to cancel the H4 terms, and we want\n\nk1 \uf0722\uf028m\uf02b1\uf029 \uf02b 4k1 k2\uf0722m \uf02b2m\uf02b2 \uf02b 6k1 k2 \uf0722m \uf02b2 \uf02b 4k1k2 \uf0722m \uf02d2m\uf02b2 \uf02b k2 \uf0722\uf028m\uf02d1\uf029\n4\n\n2\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n3\n\n2\n\n4\n\n2\n\n(7)\n\nto be as close to \uf0722 as possible. If we try to make one of the exponents in Eq. (7) equal\nto 2, direct solution of the equations show that the choices for m are 0, \u00b11, and \u00b12. Since\n\n\fwe must have m \uf03c 1in order to have a positive surface energy density on the shell, this\nwould only leave m = 0, which is a flat space-time.\nThe next best choice is to look at small deviations from 1 / \uf0722. We try m = \u00b1\uf065, 1 \u2013 \uf065\nand -1 + \uf065, with \uf065 small. The choices with m = 1 \u2013 \uf065 and -1 + \uf065 for Q give powers of \uf072 to\nthe fourth, sixth and eighth, in addition to \uf0722. Since our goal is to closely match Eq. (5),\nwe end up selecting m = \u00b1\uf065, which makes all of the terms in the denominator of Q close\nto \uf0722. For example, with m = 0.01 we have\n\nQ\uf03d\uf02d\n\n8\uf06c2\n1\n2.0402\n2.0202\n\uf070 \uf072\n\uf02b 4\uf072\n\uf02b 6\uf072 2.0002 \uf02b 4\uf0721.9802 \uf02b \uf0721.9602\n\n(8)\n\nAs shown in Fig. 1, for a = 0.001, the difference between this expression and the ideal\n\nError\n\ncharged line-source is less than 1% out to \uf072 = 1.\n\n\uf072\uf020\nFigure 1: The difference between QCL and Q as a function of \uf072 for Eq. (8). For \uf072 > 0.001,\nthe error is less than 1%.\nSince \uf065 is small, we now take a power series in it for Q in Eq. (4). We have\nThe series expansion yields\n\nk1k 2 m 2\n1\nQ\uf03d\n2\n2\uf070 \uf072 \uf028k1 \uf02b k 2 \uf0294\nIf we now take\n\n\uf0e9 4\uf028k1 \uf02d k 2 \uf029ln \uf028\uf072\uf029\n\uf0f9\nm \uf02b O\uf028m 2 \uf029\uf0fa\n\uf0ea1 \uf02b\n\uf028k1 \uf02b k 2 \uf029\n\uf0eb\n\uf0fb\n\n(9)\n\n\fk1k 2 m 2\n\uf03d \uf02d\uf06c2\n4\n\uf028k1 \uf02b k 2 \uf029\n\n(10)\n\nthen to lowest order in m this matches the charged line-source of Eq. (5). We can also\ntake a power series in m for Eqs. (3a) and (3b),\n\n2a\uf028k1 \uf02b k 2 \uf029 \uf02b 2a\uf028k1 \uf02b k 2 \uf029\uf028k1 \uf02d k 2 \uf029\uf05b2 ln \uf028a \uf029 \uf02b 1\uf05dm \uf03e 0\n2\n\n2a\uf028k1 \uf02b k 2 \uf029 \uf02b 4a\uf028k1 \uf02b k 2 \uf029 \uf028k1 \uf02d k 2 \uf029\uf05b2 ln \uf028a \uf029 \uf02b 1\uf05dm \uf03e 0\n4\n\n(11a)\n\n3\n\n(11b)\n\nshowing that in the limit m \uf0ae 0 these conditions can be satisfied for any values of k1 and\nk2.\nFinally, it is interesting to note that the second term of the expansion for the\nstress-energy tensor, Eq. (9), has a \uf072-dependence of ln (\uf072) / \uf0722. This term is interestingly\nreminiscent of the radiative correction term to the Coulomb field of an electron in QED\n[5]. The third order term turns out to have a ln2(\uf072) / \uf0722 dependence, which is similar to\nthe 'double-logarithmic' radiative correction term in QED [5]. Work is in progress to see if\na QED model of a charged spherical source might include similar terms as well.\n\n\fAcknowledgment\nThe author is grateful to D.
