Including the ESO [1] and SDSS [2, 3] surveys there are\nabout 170 MWD detected [4] and cataloged [44]. Even\nstronger fields have been found in the vicinity of neutron\nstars (B \u2248 107 \u2212 109 T) [5]. Therefore, the behavior and\nproperties of matter exposed to strong magnetic fields is\nof immediate interest. In this context, atomic physics\nplays a major role with respect to analyzing the atmospheres of these astronomical objects. Spectra resulting\nfrom theoretical investigations are a key ingredient in order to identify atomic (or molecular) species in the atmospheres of MWD. Beyond this they allow to gain information on the magnetic field strength and its landscape\nof the object under investigation.\nMost of the literature on atoms in strong magnetic\nfields deals with the hydrogen atom which has also\nbecome a paradigm for a low-dimensional chaotic system [6]. Already in the 1930s it was studied employing perturbation theory in the low field regime (B .\n2 * 103 T) [7] and later on also in the high field regime.\nBut it was not until 1984 that exact energies of the\nhydrogen atom for the complete magnetic field range\n0 \u2264 B . 5 * 108 T were available [8, 9, 10]. The calculation of accurate extensive data was made possible by\nthe advent of supercomputers. It was the accuracy and\ncompleteness of this new quantum mechanical data which\npermitted, after 40 years of speculation, an understanding of the mysterious absorption features in the spectrum\n\n\u2217 Present address: Institut f\u00fcr Physik, Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t\nzu Berlin, Hausvogteiplatz 5-7, D-10117 Berlin, Germany;\nArmin.Luehr@physik.hu-berlin.de\n\u2020 Peter.Schmelcher@pci.uni-heidelberg.de\n\nof the MWD Grw+70\u25e6 8247. They could be explained in\n1985 as a hydrogen spectrum in a magnetic field with a\npolar value of 3.2 * 104 T [11, 12, 13]. In the following\ndecades a great number of MWD with the same type of\nspectrum have been identified [13].\nIn spite of this great success, there were also spectra\nof MWD which could not be explained in terms of hydrogen lines. Therefore, also results of atoms with more\nthan one electron are needed. Ten years ago the knowledge about atoms with more than one electron in strong\nmagnetic fields was still very sparse. Even in the case of\ntwo-electron atoms the investigations covered only much\nsmaller parts of the spectrum compared to the case of\nthe hydrogen atom, and their accuracy was considerably\npoorer. At the end of the 1990s, sufficiently accurate and\nextensive data for the helium atom in the magnetic field\nregime 0 \u2264 B \u2264 2.35 * 107 T [14, 15, 16, 17] and later\nalso for 2.35 * 107 T \u2264 B \u2264 2.35 * 109 T [18] emerged.\nThese data consist exclusively of bound-state properties\nand the corresponding transitions.\nEmploying these data, it is possible to identify astronomical spectra of strongly magnetized helium atmospheres. In particular the interpretation of the absorption features in the spectrum of the MWD GD 229, one\nof the major remaining mysteries for more than 25 years,\ncould be solved. It was the first high-field MWD with an\nidentified helium atmosphere [19].\nNevertheless, the spectra of several MWD with an\nestimated hydrogen or helium atmosphere show major\nabsorption features that remain unexplained. There\nwere indications to explain the unresolved features with\nbound-free and free-free transitions but also with spectral\ncomponents of heavier elements or of ions. However, the\nliterature concerning these topics is comparably sparse.\nIn order to shed light on this issue there were efforts to\ncalculate bound-free opacities for the hydrogen atom [20].\nMore recently, extensive and accurate calculations on the\nbound state spectrum of heavier elements like lithium [21]\n\n\f2\nand beryllium [22] in strong magnetic fields have been\naccomplished. However, these newer results have not\nbeen able to explain the unresolved absorption features\nin question.\nIn view of the above it is of particular interest to explore the doubly excited states, i.e., the resonances of\nhelium in strong magnetic fields, which have not been\nconsidered to date in the literature. It is the aim of this\nwork to provide a step towards the understanding of doubly excited helium atoms in strong magnetic fields and to\nprovide the first data for the corresponding resonances.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Section II we\nintroduce the Hamiltonian and discuss its symmetries.\nIn Sec. III we report on our computational approach\nand the employed optimized basis set. Sec. IV begins\nwith a comparison of calculated resonance energies with\nthe literature in the well-known field-free case. Subsequently the resonance energies and their behavior for\ndifferent magnetic field strengths are presented and discussed. The dominant configurations contributing to the\nresonances are identified allowing us to interprete them.\nAdditionally, the widths of selected resonances are studied with increasing magnetic field strength.\n\nII.\n\nHAMILTONIAN AND SYMMETRIES\n\nOur investigation is carried out under the assumption\nof an infinite nuclear mass. However, by exploiting a\npseudo-separation of the center-of-mass motion in a magnetic field [23, 24, 25] a scaling law can be derived which\nallows one to translate the data for fixed nucleus into\nresults with a finite nuclear mass under the assumption\nof a vanishing pseudomomentum (see ref. [14] and refs.\ntherein). The finite nuclear mass effects have certainly\nto be taken into account in the high field regime [18].\nHowever, in this work we focus on the intermediate field\nregime and can therefore safely neglect the corresponding\nconsiderations.\nAssuming the magnetic field B to point in the positive z-direction and for the field strength B = |B|, our\nHamiltonian reads (atomic units are used throughout the\npaper)\nH =\n\n2\nX\n1\n2\n1\nB2 2\n( p2i \u2212\n+ B(li )z +\n(xi + yi2 ) (1)\n2\n|r\n|\n2\n8\ni\ni=1\n\n+ B(si )z ) +\n\n1\n.\n|r2 \u2212 r1 |\n\nThe one-particle operators in equation (1) are the fieldp2\nfree kinetic energies 2i , the Coulomb potential energies\n\u2212 |r2i | of the electrons in the field of the nucleus, the Zee2\n\nman terms 12 B(li )z , the diamagnetic terms B8 (x2i + yi2 )\nand the spin energies B(si )z . The two-particle operator\n1\n|r2 \u2212r1 | represents the electron-electron repulsion energy.\nFor remarks on the influence of relativistic effects and on\n\nthe electron spin g-factor, here taken to be equal to 2, we\nrefer the reader to [10, 14].\nThere exist four independent quantities commuting\nwith the Hamiltonian (1)the z-component Sz of the total spin, the z-component Lz of the total orbital angular\nmomentum and the total spatial z-parity \u03a0z . Therefore,\nthe following investigations take place in a subspace of a\nspecified symmetry, i.e. with given eigenvalues of S 2 , Sz ,\nLz and \u03a0z . Furthermore, we will denote the calculated\nstates by the magnetic field spectroscopic notation\nN\n\n\u03bd\n\n2S+1\n\nM\n\n\u03a0z\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere 2S + 1 is the spin multiplicity, M the eigenvalue\nof Lz and \u03bd = 1, 2, 3 . . . denotes the degree of excitation\nwithin a given symmetry subspace, whereas N represents\nthe excitation of the \"inner\" electron. The latter is not\nan exact quantum number but a helpful spectroscopic\nlabel within an independent-particle picture.\nIII.\n\nCOMPUTATIONAL APPROACH\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation is solved by applying a full\nconfiguration-interaction (full CI) approach. For our calculations we use an anisotropic Gaussian basis set which\nhas been put forward by Schmelcher and Cederbaum [26]\nfor the purpose of investigating atoms and molecules\nin strong magnetic fields. This one-particle basis set\nhas been successfully applied to several atoms, ions and\nmolecules [14, 15, 16, 18, 21, 22, 27, 28, 29, 30]. The\nbasis functions are optimized for each field strength and\neach symmetry separately using a nonlinear optimization\nprocedure described in efs. [14, 18]. A two-particle basis\nset within a subspace (M, \u03a0z ) is constructed by selecting configurations of two optimized one-particle orbitals\nrespecting the symmetries. The full CI approach leads\nto a generalized eigenvalue problem in which all matrix\nelements can be calculated analytically and evaluated efficiently [14, 15]. Further technical aspects are discussed\nin refs. [14, 18, 29].\nFor the investigation in this paper we use the complexscaling or complex-rotation method. This means that\nall spatial coordinates r in the Hamiltonian are formally replaced with rei\u03b8 (cf. [31, 32]). This leads to\na non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with complex eigenvalues\nW = E \u2212 2i \u0393 with the energy E and resonance width \u0393\nand to a complex-symmetric matrix representation. The\nenergies of the bound states are unaffected by this transformation, while the different continua are rotated about\ntheir respective thresholds by the angle \u22122\u03b8 from the\nreal axis into the complex energy plane. The hidden resonances of the Hamiltonian in the continuum, associated\nwith complex eigenvalues W , are revealed if a sufficiently\nlarge value of \u03b8 is chosen.\nIt is one major advantage of the complex-scaling\nmethod that the sophisticated numerical code developed\nfor bound atom systems can be directly 'translated' to\nthe case of unbound resonances. However, the complex\n\n\f3\neigenvalues W of the resonances are only independent of\nthe rotation angle \u03b8 if the basis set is complete, which is\nnot the case in any approximate numerical investigation.\nTherefore, the rotated Hamiltonian has to be calculated\nfor different values of \u03b8. The complex variational theorem\nand the complex Hellmann-Feynman theorem provide a\ncriterion for choosing an optimum resonance parameter\n\u03b8 within a given basis set [33]:\ndW (\u03b8)\nd\u03b8\n\n= 0.\n\n(3)\n\n\u03b8opt\n\nTo find that optimum \u03b8opt \u2208 C, one thus has to vary the\nimaginary part of \u03b8, too. This can be interpreted as a\nreal scaling parameter of the wave functions. Obviously,\nthe criterion (3) is only fulfilled approximately since we\ncan only calculate finite differences between eigenvalues\nbelonging to Hamiltonians with a different value of the\nrotation angle \u03b8.\nIn our investigation the diagonalization of the rotated\nHamiltonian is carried out for about 50 to 80 different\nvalues of \u03b8. The used basis-set size varies from 4000 to\n6000 two-particle configurations. This results in a computational effort of approximately 30 to 200 hours CPU\ntime on a powerful PC for each magnetic field strength\nand symmetry subspace.\nIV.\n\nRESULTS\n\nIn principle, one distinguishes two kinds of excitations\nof the helium atom using the independent-particle picture. On the one hand, there are the single excitations\nof the helium atom. Their \"inner\" electron occupies predominantly the one-particle ground state of He+ . The\nsecond \"outer\" electron carries, like a hydrogenic electron, the angular momentum alone. All bound states are\nof this kind. On the other hand, there are the doubly excited helium states where the \"inner\" electron is excited,\ntoo. They appear as resonances in the continuum of the\nsingly excited helium states. The degree of the \"inner\"\nand \"outer\" excitation is denoted by N with N = 1, 2, . . .\nand by n with n \u2265 N , respectively. States with the same\n\"inner\" excitation N form Rydberg series converging energetically to the threshold IN . These thresholds correspond to the energies of an excited helium ion He+ in the\nN -th energy level.\nA.\n\nResonances in the field-free case\n\nDoubly excited (DE) helium has been an active research topic for the last 40 years, both from the numerical and analytical standpoint (cf. review [34]). Major\ncontributions to the calculation of the energy levels were\nprovided by, e.g., B\u00fcrgers et al. (S-states) [35], Ho et\nal. (P- and D-states) [36, 37] or Bachau (N = 3 states)\n[38]. However, the data have not reached the same accuracy and completeness compared with the literature of\n\nsingly excited helium. DE helium is considered as a standard model for a strongly correlated system. We use the\nstandard notation i.e. the correlation quantum numbers\nintroduced by Herrick, Sinano\u011flu [39] and Lin [40]:\n2S+1\n\nL\u03a0 N (K, T )A\nn .\n\n(4)\n\nHere L is the total angular momentum, and K and T\nrepresent angular and A radial correlations.\nHowever, the focus of this paper lies on the interaction\nof the atomic system with a strong magnetic field. For\na finite field strength the correlation quantum numbers\n(4) lose their meaning. Therefore, it is instructive to\nconsider the correspondence between the magnetic field\nspectroscopic notation (2) and the field-free one (4) which\nis done for the states studied here in table I.\nTable II provides the relative accuracy of our calculated energies E and decay widths \u0393 for the energetically\nlowest resonances in the absence of the field. The comparison was performed with the corresponding high precision results available in the literature [35, 36, 37, 41].\nGenerally it has to be remarked that for the states considered here, the absolute values of the energies are significantly larger than the values of the corresponding widths.\nThe accuracy of our results is consequently much higher\nfor the energies compared to the widths. Except for the\nstates 3 1 0+ and 4 3 (\u00b11)+ all calculated energies possess\na relative accuracy in the range of 7.5 * 10\u22124 to 2 * 10\u22125 .\nObviously our approach is not best-suited to describe\nthe resonances in the absence of the external field i.e.\ncannot compete with the best methods available in the\nliterature based e.g. on a Hylleraas basis. However, our\nfocus is to provide first results on resonances in strong\nmagnetic fields and in this case our anisotropic Gaussian basis set is certainly superior to existing field-free\nmethods that cannot efficiently describe the pronounced\nanisotropy present in a strong field. This reflects itself\nalso in the different symmetries for B = 0 and B 6= 0.\n\nB.\n1.\n\nResonances in a magnetic field\n\nDependence of the resonance energies on M and Sz\n\nThe Zeeman term of the Hamiltonian (1) depends linearly on Lz and remains unchanged when the complex\nrotation is applied.

Solid lines (-) stand for singlet and dotted lines (* * * ) for\ntriplet states. Additionally to Ebin (B), approximate energies\nare given (- -) which are a sum of the binding energies of a\nHe+ ion and a hydrogen atom (see text for details).\n\nin figure 2b one can see that in the high field regime III)\nthe energies Eapp (B) come energetically close to the calculated resonance energies and show the same qualitative\nbehavior. In this regime also a degeneracy of the singlet\n(-) and triplet (* * * ) states takes place (only Sz = 0\nis considered here). These features become more pronounced with increasing field strength and higher degree\nof excitation (logarithmic scale!). Let us concentrate as\nan example on the approximation Eapp (He+ (2p\u22121 ) H(2s0 ))\nto the energies of the singlet and triplet ground states 11 (\u22121)+\nand 13 (\u22121)+ , respectively. It obviously significantly underestimates the magnitude of their binding energies in the field\nregime I) and II) where both states are also energetically sig-\n\nnificantly separated. This is a sign for the strong overlap of\nthe two electrons of the DE helium. This overlap decreases in\nthe region III) and the electrons become spatially separated.\nTherefore, it is possible in III) to speak of an \"inner\" He+ -like\nelectron, which is located close to the nucleus and screens one\ncharge unit and of an \"outer\" H-like electron at a distance\nnoticing only one effective positive charge.\nThe above-observed behavior can be illustrated by using\nan independent-particle picture. All one-electron states except the tightly bound states are elongated along the magnetic field axis and squeezed perpendicular to it with increasing magnetic field strength. Tightly bound states (1s0 , 2p\u22121 ,\n3d\u22122 , . . .) are confined parallel to the magnetic field axis as\nwell, and their binding energy rises strongly with increasing\nfield strength [10]. In case that one of the electrons occupies\na tightly bound orbital, the overlap of two electrons steadily\ndecreases with increasing magnetic field strength. Thus the\ntightly bound electron is located close to the nucleus screening one charge, while the second electron stays mainly near\nthe z-axis at a distance to the core and behaves therefore similar to an electron of a hydrogen atom. This scenario applies\nto the subspace M = \u22121 \u03a0z = +1 since 2p\u22121 is a tightly\nbound orbital and consequently all other possible orbitals of\nthe second electron are not tightly bound.\nIn the subspace M = 0 in figure 2a no degeneracy of the\nenergies of the singlet and triplet states occurs in the presence of a strong field. However, the singlet states can be well\napproximated by the corresponding Eapp (B). An exception\nto this rule is the ground state 11 (0)+ , which is approximated\nonly qualitatively by the binding energies of He+ (2p0 ) and\nH(2p0 ), which corresponds to an intrashell state. In an intrashell state with both electrons approximately in the same\norbital, it is expected that the assumption of weakly interacting electrons fails. Of course, there is no triplet partner\nfor the ground state which is approximately described by the\nsymmetric (2p0 )2 configuration. In contrast to the subspace\nM = \u22121 the resonances of the subspace M = 0 contain no\n(dominating) configurations that include a tightly bound orbital. As a consequence also the \"inner\" He+ -like electron\nis elongated along the z-axis and a noticeable overlap of the\nelectronic orbitals remains even in the strong field regime III).\nThe strong increase of some energies in the regime 0.1 \u2264\nB \u2264 1 (see figures 2a and 2b) can be partly modeled with\ntwo-electron configurations that consist of an electronic wave\nfunction of a helium ion He+ (2s0 ) and a hydrogen atom and\nare not shown in figure 2. This effect results from the increasing energetic gap between the binding energy of He+ (2s0 ) and\nHe+ (2p0 ) which can be seen in figure 1a. Note that the approximations applied in the strong magnetic field regime III)\ndo not hold in the regimes I) and II) and particularly not in\nthe field-free situation [40].\nAs a next step we aim at investigating the energetically lowest DE helium state in a strong magnetic field. Therefore, we\nsearched for the DE helium state with the strongest binding\nenergy in the field range III). The latter is dominated by the\nconfiguration He+ (2p\u22121 ) H(2p\u22121 ) [10]. Consequently we calculated the energetically lowest singlet states of the subspace\nM = \u22122 and \u03a0z = +1.\nIn figure 3 the energetic distances of the two energetically lowest singlet states to the first ionization threshold\nI1 (B) = EHe+ (1s0 ) (B) + B are shown. The energies of both\nstates show a weak dependence on the field strength for\nB < 0.01.

A crossover of the first ionization threshold seems to take place for B \u2248 65 a.u. This\nwould correspond to a stabilization of the resonance 11 (\u22122)+\nand a conversion to a bound state for a magnetic field B > 65\nsince the autoionization process is not possible anymore. The\nenergetically lowest resonance is approximated only qualitatively by the configuration involving the non-interacting orbitals He+ (2p\u22121 ) and H(2p\u22121 ), for it is an intrashell state\nwhich consists of two tightly bound orbitals. We note that\nthe above considerations assume a spin singlet for both the\nresonance and the threshold state, which is indeed not the\nenergetically lowest state in the strong field regime.\nThe second singlet state 21 (\u22122)+ is approximated well by\nthe configuration involving the orbitals He+ (2p\u22121 ), H(3p\u22121 )\nand for B > 1 there is hardly a difference visible on the scale\nof figure 3. This can be explained by applying the same argument as for the subspace M = \u22121 where all calculated\nstates also consist approximately of a tightly bound and a\nnon-tightly bound orbital. However, the energetic difference\nto I1 (B) increases strongly in the high field regime and no\ncrossing of I1 (B) is possible.\nUsing the results which have been obtained so far one can\nrelate the doubly excited helium states in a magnetic field\ndenoted by the spectroscopic field notation (2) in the limit\nof a high field strength to the corresponding dominant independent particle configurations of a helium ion and hydrogen\nelectron. This has been done in table III. In addition, the corresponding correlation quantum numbers (4) for a vanishing\nmagnetic field B = 0 are given.\n\nResonance widths\n\nParallel to the real energies dealt with in subsection IV B 2,\nthe corresponding imaginary parts \u0393 have been calculated,\ntoo. \u0393 is interpreted as the width of the resonance and therefore as the inverse lifetime. Typically, the absolute values of\nthe widths are by orders of magnitude smaller than the real\nenergies. Our method allows for the same absolute accuracy\nfor both the real and the imaginary part. This leads to a\nsignificantly lower relative accuracy of the resonance widths\ncompared to the real energies. The widths themselves vary\nby orders of magnitudes. Therefore, it is most natural to inspect the behavior of those widths more closely which possess\na large absolute value (\u0393/2 \u2265 0.0001). These include three\nsinglet states of the M = 0 \u03a0z = +1 subspace 11 0+ , 21 0+\nand 41 0+ , which are shown in figure 4a. Additionally, the\nwidths of the two energetically lowest resonance states of the\nM = \u22121 \u03a0z = +1 subspace, 11 (\u22121)+ and 13 (\u22121)+ , are presented in figure 4b. The corresponding data can be found in\nthe tables IV, V, VII and VIII.\nFor B < 0.05 just a weak dependence on the magnetic field\ncan be observed for the three singlet states in figure 4a. With\nfurther increasing field strength, the widths start to fluctuate,\nalthough this fluctuation could possibly be a consequence of\nthe finite numerical accuracy. The width of the state 11 0+\nincreases in the regime 1 < B < 2 approximately by a factor\nof 4.\nIn figure 4b we compare a singlet and a triplet state otherwise possessing the same quantum numbers. In figure 2b\nwe have seen that the energies of these states become degenerate for B > 2. For B < 0.1 their widths fluctuate around\na mean value of 7 * 10\u22124 (11 (\u22121)+ ) and 1.5 * 10\u22124 (13 (\u22121)+ ),\nrespectively.

This means that both states\nbecome energetically degenerate for strong magnetic fields,\nbut the behavior of the corresponding resonance widths is\ndifferent in this field range.\n\nV.\n\nSUMMARY AND OUTLOOK\n\nWe have investigated the energies and lifetimes of the resonance states of a doubly excited helium atom exposed to a\nmagnetic field. The nonrelativistic, infinite-mass Hamiltonian\nis characterized by the symmetries associated with the four\nquantum numbers: M , \u03a0z , S 2 and Sz . Our computational\n\napproach consists of the complex scaling method applied to\na full configuration-interaction scheme based on nonlinearly\noptimized anisotropic Gaussian orbitals.\nIn order to show the behavior of the DE helium states denoted by the spectroscopic field notation (2) in the limits of\nweak and strong magnetic field strength, we have presented\nfor vanishing magnetic field their corresponding correlation\nquantum numbers (4) and for a strong magnetic field their\ncorresponding independent-particle configurations of a helium\nion and hydrogen electron.\nIn total the energies of 17 DE states have been calculated. Their behavior can be subdivided into three magnetic\nfield ranges: the weak (0 \u2264 B \u2264 10\u22122 ), the intermediate\n(10\u22122 < B \u2264 1) and the strong (1 < B \u2264 102 ) field regime.\nWith increasing field strength we observe the transition from\na weak to a strong dependence on the magnetic field which is\naccompanied by a reorganization of the energies of the resonances especially in the intermediate field regime.\nIn the strong field regime, a clustering of the calculated\nenergies into different branches according to their magnetic\nquantum numbers takes place. Furthermore, the electronelectron interaction becomes less important with increasing\nfield strength, being more pronounced for the states of the\nsubspace M = \u22121 than for those of M = 0. As a result, a\ncrude description of the resonance energies by the sum of the\nenergies of a He+ ion and a hydrogen atom is possible. An\nexception to this rule are the intrashell states. The DE helium\nstate with the lowest energy (Sz = 0) is the state 11 (\u22122)+ of\nthe subspace M = \u22122. This resonance state can probably\nbe stabilized by a magnetic field, for its calculated energy\nbecomes smaller than the one-electron ionization threshold\nfor a field strength of B > 65.\nThe behavior of the widths of five calculated resonances\nwith great absolute value (\u0393 & 10\u22124 ) has been inspected. The\ndependence of the widths on the magnetic field for low field\nstrengths B < 0.1 is weak. The values of the widths are fluctuating around their mean values, which could be due to the\nfinite numerical accuracy of our method. For field strengths\nB > 1 the widths of two states, namely 11 0+ and 11 (\u22121)+ ,\nsignificantly increase while the widths of the other investigated states still fluctuate with an increasing amplitude.\nHaving presented the first data on the energies of the resonances of DE helium in a magnetic field, several issues still\nhave to be addressed in future works. In order to get synthetic\nspectra of astronomical objects like MWD, the number of calculated states should be increased including also states with\n\u03a0z = \u22121. Additionally, magnetic field dependent oscillator\nstrengths and electromagnetic-transition probabilities have to\nbe studied. On the other hand, a closer look at the resonance\nwidths would be desirable in order to gain a deeper understanding of the role of electron-electron interactions and the\nautoionization process under the influence of a magnetic field.\nAn increased accuracy of our data would be a prerequisite for\nthis.\n\nVI.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe are grateful to H.-D.
