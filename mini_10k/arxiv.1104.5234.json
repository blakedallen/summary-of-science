As it is well known,\nHubbard models reduce to various spin models in certain\nlimits. Most of these limits, and even many others, are\naccessible with ultracold lattice atoms.\nThere are several ways of achieving such a situation,\nthe simplest perhaps is the case where spin-1/2 is associated to the presence or the absence of a structureless boson in a lattice site (the, so called, hard-core\nboson limit). More generally, if one considers systems\nof particles with several internal states in many body\nMott insulator states, such systems are well described by\nlow energy effective Hamiltonians that incorporate superexchange interactions6 , and quite generally correspond to\nspin models2,7\u20139 , or composite fermions models9,10 . If the\ninternal states correspond to pseudo-spin, the resulting\nHamiltonians typically do not have special symmetries.\nIf, on the contrary, the internal states correspond to the\ndegenerate manifold of the hyperfine atomic level F , i.e.\n{|F, mF i} of an ultracold spinor gas, the resulting Hamiltonians, in the absence of symmetry breaking fields, are\nSU (2) symmetric. The corresponding spin Hamiltonians are given by powersP\nof the nearest neighbor Heisenk\nberg interactions H =\nk ak (Si * Sj ) (for F = 1 see\nfor instance11 , for F = 2, 3/2, 5/2 c.f.12 , and for general\nFermi systems c.f.13\u201315 ).\nThe are two kinds of symmetry breaking fields that\ncan be realized and controlled both in atomic-ionic and\nin condensed matter systems: those corresponding to the\nlinear Zeeman effect for atoms (z aligned magnetic field\nin condensed matter), or the quadratic Zeeman effect\n(single ion anisotropy in condensed matter). The linear\nZeeman effect is important, but not so interesting, since\nthe magnetization is a constant of the motion, and it\ncan effectively be \"gauged out\"16 . Also, in experiments,\n\nfrequently magnetic fields oscillate rapidly in time, and\ntheir effect averages to zero. This is not the case for\nthe quadratic Zeeman effect, which leads to more complex and interesting effects.17\u201319 Particulary interesting\nare these effects in one dimension (1D), where the role of\nquantum fluctuations is enhanced.\nFor these reasons, considerable efforts have been devoted to the study of the simplest case of spin-1 chains,\nnamely the, so called, bilinear-biquadratic spin-1 chains\nundergoing a quadratic Zeeman effect. On the other\nhand, for the most of the known spin-1 alkali atomic systems, the scattering lengths in different scattering channels are practically equal, so that the scattering is effectively spin state independent. That means that the\nsystems exhibits higher symmetry, in the case of F = 1\nthe SU (3) symmetry. A similar situation occurs with\nearth alkali fermionic atoms, that can have spin F and\nexhibit spin state independent collisions, i.e. SU (2F + 1)\nsymmetry15 .\nVery recently, Rodriguez et al.16 have studied the\nphase diagram of the bilinear-biquadratic spin-1 chains\nundergoing the quadratic Zeeman effect close to the\nSU (3) symmetric point. These authors have used an\nelegant effective field model, that allowed them to evaluate approximately the phase boundaries for the case of\nvanishing magnetization in any dimension. The study of\nRef.16 was, however, restricted to a quite limited region\nof parameters. The reason is that they consider only the\nregion of the phase space achievable in alkaline ultracold\ngases by means of standard Feshbach resonances.\nThe present paper complements and extends the study\nof Rodriguez et al.16 to the full range of parameters of the\nuniaxial spin-1 chain. We point out that by using the idea\nof employing \"quantum simulators in excited states\"20 ,\ni.e. studying properties of the spin chain not necessarily\nin the ground state, but in the state of maximal energy, it\nis possible to cover the entire range of parameters for the\nbilinear biquadratic spin-1 chains: from ferromagnetic to\nfully anti-ferromagnetic. The idea is here very simple:\n\n\f2\n\nII.\n\nTHE SPIN-1 CHAIN IN A UNIAXIAL\nFIELD: PREVIOUS RESULTS\n\nWe consider a one dimensional spin-1 chain of length\nL with open boundary conditions whose Hamiltonian is:\nH = HBB + HU =\nL\u22121\nX\u0002\n\u0003\ncos(\u03b8)Si * Si+1 + sin(\u03b8)(Si * Si+1 )2\n= J\ni=1\n\n+ D\n\nL\nX\n\n2\nSzi\n\n(1)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere Si = (Sxi , Syi , Szi ) are the ith site angular momentum operators. The model is the sum of two terms,\nHBB and HU . The former, proportional to J, is known\nas the bilinear-biquadratic spin-1 Hamiltonian, while the\nlatter is a uniaxial field term proportional to D. In the\nrest of this section we review known results about this\nmodel.\nA.\n\nThe case D = 0\n\nFor D = 0, the phase diagram of HBB as a function\nof \u03b8 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0; \u03c0] is well known (see for example22 ).

Using degenerate perturbation theory, we\nshow in a neat way how the emergence of the phases can\nbe obtained from the anisotropy of an effective XXZ spin1/2 model. Our results are summarized in Fig. 1, where\nfor reference we mark also the region studied in16 . Our\nresults agree quantitatively with the description provided\nin 16 in this region, although we found some significant\ndiscrepancies in the boundaries of some of the phases, as\nwe shall comment later.\nThe paper is organized as follows: in Sec. II we introduce the model and the quantities of interest. Here\nwe briefly review the earlier, mainly condensed matter,\nliterature for a non-zero anisotropy field. In Sec. III we\ninitiate the study of the complete phase diagram. We\ndiscuss the results in various important limits, first for\nlarge negative D (Sec. III A) where perturbation theory\nleads to an effective XXZ spin 1/2 model. The distinct\nemerging phases are subsequently analyzed: dimer phase\n(Sec. III B); the N\u00e9el phase (Sec. III C); the Haldane\nphase (Sec. III D); the ferromagnetic phases (Sec. III E)\nand the critical phases (Sec. III F). We conclude in Sec.\nIV.\n\n-0.75\n\n-0.5\n\n-0.25\n\n0\n\n\u03b8/\u03c0\n\n0.25\n\n0.5\n\n0.75\n\n1\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Top: Phase diagram of a spin-1 chain\nin a Zeeman quadratic field as a function of \u03b8 and D obtained\nby means of the DMRG algorithm. The dashed red box indicates the portion of phase diagram studied in Ref.16 . Bottom:\nthe anisotropy \u2206 of the effective spin-1/2 XXZ model in the\nlimit of large negative D as a function of \u03b8 (see the results\nof perturbation theory in Sec. III A). The vertical dotted\nlines separate the resulting phases: N\u00e9el (\u2206 > 1), critical\n(\u22121 < \u2206 < 1) and ferromagnetic (\u2206 < \u22121).\n\n\u2212\u03c0 < \u03b8 < \u22123\u03c0/4 and for \u03c0/2 < \u03b8 < \u03c0 the ground\nstate is ferromagnetic with a net spontaneous magnetization along a direction which breaks spontaneously space\nisotropy. For \u22123\u03c0/4 < \u03b8 < \u2212\u03c0/4 the ground state is\ncharacterized by a non vanishing dimer order parameter:\nD = |Hi \u2212 Hi+1 |\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Hi = cos(\u03b8)Si * Si+1 + sin(\u03b8)(Si * Si+1 )2 . In this\nphase, translational invariance is broken and singlets of\nneighboring spins appear. On the other hand, a nematic\nphase has been predicted in the region between the dimer\nand ferromagnetic phase23 . Its existence is however still\ndebated24\u201327 . The difficulty in establishing the true nature of the region close to the ferromagnetic phase is due\nto the fact that the dimer order parameter decays exponentially as \u03b8 \u2192 \u22123\u03c0/4.\nFor \u2212\u03c0/4 < \u03b8 < \u03c0/4 the system is in the Haldane\nphase. This is a topological phase, containing for \u03b8 =\narctan(1/3) the Affleck, Lieb, Kennedy, Tasaki (AKLT)\npoint28 whose ground state can be written in terms of\nmatrix product states. The entire phase is characterized by free edge spins and a non vanishing string order\n\n\f3\nparameter22,29 :\n\nIII.\n\nO = lim hSzi exp[i\u03c0\nr\u2192\u221e\n\ni+r\u22121\nX\nj=i+1\n\nSzj ]Szi+r i\n\n(3)\n\nRecently, it has been shown that topological phases in\none dimensional systems can be detected by a doubly degenerate entanglement spectrum30 . In other words, the\neigenvalues of the reduced density matrix of a portion of\nthe chain are always doubly degenerate in a topological\nphase. Moreover, the characterization of the phase transitions around the Haldane phase in terms of the Schmidt\ngap, i.e. the difference of the two largest density matrix\neigenvalues, has been recently reported in31 .\nFinally for \u03c0/4 < \u03b8 < \u03c0/2 the system is in a critical, gapless phase, characterized by zero energy modes\nat momentum q = 0, \u00b12\u03c0/3 and has been extensively\nstudied27 . The existence of these gapless modes is reflected in a peak at q = 2\u03c0/3 in the magnetic and nematic\nstructure factors:\n1X\nSC (q) =\nexp[iq(m \u2212 n)]hCm Cn i\nL mn\n\n(4)\n\nwhere C = Sz or C = Sz2 respectively. The periodicity\ninduced by these momenta is also connected to the existence of trimers in the phase. Very recently, an order\nparameter has been proposed which can be experimentally observed in an optical lattice setting32 .\n\nTHE COMPLETE PHASE DIAGRAM\n\nIn this paper we study the complete phase diagram of\nHamiltonian (1) in the interval \u03b8 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0; \u03c0] and D/J \u2208\n[\u22122; 3]. Our main result is summarized in Fig. 1 showing\nthe resulting phase diagram. In the limit of large negative D/J we apply perturbation theory to reconstruct the\nphase diagram. In the general case, we conduct extensive numerical simulations using the finite size density\nmatrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm (see\nfor example21 and references therein) with open boundary conditions. The number of block states retained has\nbeen always chosen so that the discarded weight, connected to the algorithm accuracy, is less than 10\u22126 or\nuntil convergence is reached. Typically we used between\n100 and 250 states. In the remainder of the paper we discuss the different phases individually and the transitions\nseparating them.\nA.\n\nLimit of large negative D\n\nLet us start by considering the limit of large negative\nD so that we can apply perturbation theory assuming\n|J/D| \u226a 1. For J = 0 and negative D the ground state\nof HU is degenerate and pertains to the manifold spanned\nby the states:\n|\u01eb1 \u01eb2 . . . \u01ebL i\n\n(6)\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u01ebi = \u00b11. The unperturbed ground state energy\nis simply DL < 0 where L is the size of the chain. In\nthis limit, HBB acts as a perturbation and we can apply\nfirst order degenerate perturbation theory. This consists\nin diagonalizing the perturbation Hamiltonian in the degenerate subspace. Projecting the Hamiltonian HBB on\nthis manifold leads to the effective spin-1/2 Hamiltonian:\nX\u00141\n3\ny\nx\nH\u0303BB = JL sin \u03b8 + J\nsin \u03b8(\u03c3ix \u03c3i+1\n+ \u03c3iy \u03c3i+1\n)+\n2\n2\ni\n\u0015\n1\nz z\n+ (2 cos \u03b8 \u2212 sin \u03b8)\u03c3i \u03c3i+1 = E0 (\u03b8) + HXXZ (7)\n2\n\nand is therefore in an Ising-N\u00e9el phase; finally, for large\npositive D the ground state is adiabatically connected to\nthe trivial state |00 . . . 0i in which all the spins are in the\nSzn = 0 eigenstate. For this reason this phase has been\ndubbed the \"large D\" phase.\nRecently, Rodriguez et al.16 have proposed to realize model (1) for D 6= 0 with spinor ultracold atoms\nin optical lattices. They found that by making use of\nFeshbach resonances in 87 Rb atoms, the interval \u03b8 \u2208\n(\u2212\u03c0 + arctan 31 ; \u2212\u03c0/2) around the SU(3) point can be\nrealized. They studied the corresponding phase diagram in 1D, 2D and 3D, finding unique phases: an XYferromagnetic phase for D > 0 and \u03b8 < \u22123\u03c0/4 and an\nXY-nematic phase for D < 0 and \u03b8 \u2208 [\u22123\u03c0/4; \u2212\u03c0/2].\n\nwhere \u03c3ix , \u03c3iy and \u03c3iz are the spin-1/2 Pauli matrices for\nthe ith spin in the basis {|1i , |\u22121i}.\nTherefore, apart from a constant energy shift E0 (\u03b8), for\nlarge negative D the system is described by an effective\nXXZ spin-1/2 model with anisotropy \u2206 = (2 cos \u03b8 \u2212\nsin \u03b8)/| sin \u03b8|. As shown in Fig. 1, the quantity \u2206(\u03b8) as\na function of \u03b8 spans twice the real axis when \u03b8 changes\nfrom \u2212\u03c0 to \u03c0. The properties of the XXZ models are\nwell known40 : it is ferromagnetic for \u2206 < \u22121, it is in\nthe critical XY phase for \u22121 < \u2206 < 1 and in the IsingN\u00e9el phase for \u2206 > 1. We can, therefore, reconstruct\nthe phase diagram in this regime as a function of \u03b8 as\nsketched in Fig. 1. The system is in the N\u00e9el phase for\n\u2212\u03c0/2 < \u03b8 < \u03c0/4, in the ferromagnetic phase for \u2212\u03c0 <\n\u03b8 < \u22123\u03c0/4 and for \u03c0/4 < \u03b8 < \u03c0 and in the critical XY\n\nB.\n\nThe case D 6= 0\n\nThe Hamiltonian of Eq. (1) has also been studied for\n\u03b8 = 0 and different values of D33\u201339 . The resulting\nground state phase diagram contains three phases: in the\nvicinity of D = 0 the system is in the already mentioned\nHaldane phase; for large negative values of D, the ground\nstate exhibits a spontaneous staggered magnetization:\nMzst =\n\n1X\n(\u22121)n Szn\nL n\n\n\f4\n\nD\u221e\n\n0.1 (b)\n\nD(1/L)\n\n0.7 (a)\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2 D\u221e=0.27\n0.1\n0.0\n-0.1 0\n\n0.01\n96\n\n1/\n\n2\n13\n1/\n8\n16\n1/ 04\n2\n1/\n\n0.1\n\n1\n-D/J\n\n(1/L)\nFIG. 2: (Color online) (a) Finite size extrapolation of the\ndimer order paramter for \u03b8 = \u22120.4\u03c0 and two values of D:\nD = \u22120.2J (plus) for which the extrapolated result is D\u221e =\n0.27 and D = \u22120.7J (crosses) for which the extrapolated\nvalue is negative and therefore D\u221e = 0. Also shown are the\ncorresponding fitting functions. (b) The extrapolated dimer\norder parameter for \u03b8 = \u22120.6\u03c0 and large negative D. The\nplot is shown as a function of \u2212D/J and in a log-log plot.\nThe data are compared with a power-law with exponent 0.75\n(solid line).\n\nphase for \u22123\u03c0/4 < \u03b8 < \u2212\u03c0/2 and for \u03c0/4 < \u03b8 < \u03c0/2. We\nuse these analytical results as a guide for the numerical\nsimulations in the limit of large negative D. Notice that\nin the opposite limit of large positive D, the ground state\nis non degenerate and given by the product state in which\nall the spins are in the state |0i. In this case, perturbation\ntheory gives poor results36 . In the following sections,\nwe analyze separately each phase characterizing it with\nappropriate orders.\n\nB.\n\nWith this technique we reconstruct the dimer phase as\nshown in Fig. 1. Surprisingly enough, the dimer phase\npersists even at D = \u22122J. Although the dimer order parameter is different from zero, it is really small as shown\nin Fig. 2(b) and decays not faster than algebraically to\nzero as D \u2192 \u2212\u221e. This is consistent with our predictions\nfrom perturbation theory that dimerization is zero in this\nlimit. We cannot however exclude that the border of the\ndimer phase occurs for a finite value of D/J < \u22122. This\nresult does not agree with Ref.16 which for \u03b8 = \u22120.5\u03c0\npredicts the transition around D = \u22120.3J.\nWe analyze the robustness of the dimer phase for positive D (see the inset of Fig. 1): for example for \u03b8 = \u22120.5\u03c0\nthe dimer order parameter is already zero for D \u2265 0.05J.\nAgain, this is in clear contrast with the results of Ref.16\nwhich predicts the transition for D \u223c 0.6J and a cusplike behavior which we do not observe. The disagreement\ncould be due to the small system sizes taken in Ref.16 .\nThe finite size effects are in fact evident in Fig. 2(a),\nshowing that a careful extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit is in order.\nNotice that the procedure we use here is reliable only\naway from criticality and serves us to approximately locate the phase boundaries. To get more accurate results\nfor the critical points as well as critical exponents we will\nmake use in Sec. III C of finite size scaling theory.\nWe leave as an open question the behavior of the\ndimer phase boundaries close to the point D = 0 and\n\u03b8 = \u22123/4\u03c0 where the gap and the dimer order parameter are expected to decrease exponentially. Accurate\nboundaries are therefore hard to get with our code and\nprobably more sophisticated tensor networks techniques\nare required.\n\nThe dimer phase\nC.\n\nWe begin our numerical analysis with the dimer phase.\nAs said in Sec. II this phase is characterized by the presence of the dimer order parameter D. In order to obtain\nresults in the thermodynamic limit we computed D, using\nDMRG, for different system sizes L = 96, 132, 168, 204\nand then performed a finite size extrapolation with a\nquadratic function:\n\u0012 \u0013\nb1\n1\nb2\nD\n= D\u221e +\n(8)\n+ 2\nL\nL\nL\nTwo examples of such extrapolation are shown in\nFig. 2(a) for \u03b8 = \u22120.4\u03c0: (i) for D = \u22120.2J the extrapolated dimer order is D\u221e = 0.27J and therefore we\nconclude that this point is in the dimer phase; (ii) for\nD = \u22120.7J the extrapolated result is zero and therefore\nthe point is not in the dimer phase. We have compared\nour extrapolated result in the point D = 0 and \u03b8 = \u2212\u03c0/2\nwith the analytical result valid in the thermodynamic\nlimit D = 1.1243 found in Ref.41 (see also24 ). Our result\nis D\u221e = 1.13 and the less than 1% relative error gives\nan idea of the quality of our numerical simulations.\n\nThe N\u00e9el phase\n\nAs found in previous works33\u201339 and predicted by\nour perturbation theory results, in the asymptotic limit\nD \u2192 \u2212\u221e, a N\u00e9el phase occurs. This phase is characterized by a non zero spontaneous staggered magnetization\ndefined in Eq. (5) which we use as the order parameter.\nSimilar to the dimer phase, to locate the boundaries of\nthe N\u00e9el phase, we extrapolate the staggered magnetization to the thermodynamic limit. In order to compare our\nresults to precise quantum Monte Carlo simulations39 we\nmake use of finite size scaling (FSS) theory42 to obtain\nthe corresponding critical exponents. In the so called\nscaling regime, the dependence of an observable Q, when\na parameter g of the Hamiltonian (in our case \u03b8 or D)\nvaries close to the critical point gc , is given by:\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(9)\nQ \u2243 L\u2212\u03b2Q /\u03bd fQ |g \u2212 gc |L1/\u03bd\nwhere \u03bd characterizes the divergence of the correlation\nlength when approaching the critical point: \u03be \u223c |g \u2212\ngc |\u2212\u03bd and \u03b2Q is the order parameter exponent: Q \u223c |g \u2212\ngc |\u03b2Q in the ordered phase. To locate the critical point\n\n\f5\nAfter finding the ground state |\u03c8G i of the system using\nDMRG, we construct the reduced density matrix of half\nchain:\n\n1.2\n\nMzst * L0.1\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n\n\u03c1L = TrR |\u03c8G i h\u03c8G |\n\n1.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.8\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n\n-10 -5 0 5 10\n(-0.316 - D/J)*L0.9\n-0.35\n\n-0.3\nD/J\n\n-0.25\n\n-0.2\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Finite size scaling of the staggered\nmagnetization Mz for lengths: L = 96, 132, 168, 204 for \u03b8 = 0\nclose to the critical point separating the N\u00e9el and Haldane\nphases. Inset: the corresponding collapse plot (see text).\n\ngc we plot QL\u03b11 for different sizes L as a function of g\nand change \u03b11 until there is a crossing of all the curves.\nThis procedure will give us gc at the crossing point and\n\u03b2Q /\u03bd = \u03b11 . In order to compute \u03b2Q , we plot QL\u03b2Q /\u03bd as\na function of (g \u2212 gc )L\u03b12 and change \u03b12 until we observe\ncollapse of the data for all lengths L. In this way we\nextract \u03b2 = \u03b11 /\u03b12 and \u03bd = 1/\u03b12 .\nCare must be taken, because in a finite size system the\nZ2 symmetry of the Hamiltonian is not spontaneously\nbroken. To circumvent this technical issue, we add a\nsmall magnetic field acting only on the first spin, corresponding to an additional term 0.01JSz1 .\nWe use this method for \u03b8 = 0 so that we can compare our results with Ref.39 , which employs quantum\nMonte Carlo simulations and in which the estimate for\nthe critical point is at DcQM = \u22120.316J and for the expoQM\nnent for the staggered magnetization \u03b2M\n= 0.147 while\nz\nQM\n\u03bd\n= 1.01 which are not far from the universal exponents of the 2D classical Ising model (\u03b2Mz = 1/8 and\n\u03bd = 1). Our results for the staggered magnetization are\nshown in Fig. 3. Crossing and collapse of the data for\nlengths L = 96, 132, 168, 204 happen for Dc = \u22120.316J,\n\u03b2Mz = 0.11 \u00b1 0.01, \u03bd = 1.1 \u00b1 0.1 which agree with Ref.39\nand with the Ising universality class. We checked that for\nother fixed values of \u03b8, the critical points, as D changes,\nare also of the Ising type.\n\nD.\n\nThe Haldane phase\n\nThe Haldane phase is the archetypal example of a topological phase in one dimensional spin systems. In this\npaper we characterize it using two key quantities: the\nstring order parameter defined in Eq. (3) and the degeneracy of the entanglement spectrum defined as follows.\n\n(10)\n\nThe entanglement spectrum is given by the setPof eigenvalues \u03bbi of the density matrix \u03c1L such that i \u03bbi = 1\nand ordered in decreasing order. A topological phase,\nsuch as Haldane, is signaled by a doubly degenerate spectrum. A handful quantity for detecting the Haldane\nphase is the Schmidt gap, given by the difference of the\ntwo largest eigenvalues of \u03c1L : \u2206\u03bb = \u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb2 .\nWe studied the robustness of the topological phase in\npresence of the SU(2) Zeeman quadratic field using both\nthe Schmidt gap and the string order parameter. In\nFig. 4, we display our results for \u03b8 = 0 and for positive and negative values of D/J. Both the Schmidt gap\nand the string order O clearly identify the Haldane phase,\nhowever one has to be careful since O is different from\nzero also in the N\u00e9el phase. This is evident if one considers the perfect N\u00e9el state |+1, \u22121, +1, \u22121 . . . i. This\nambiguity is resolved by looking at the staggered magnetization Mzst also reported in the plot. Contrary to the\nN\u00e9el phase, the string order goes instead to zero in the\nlarge D phase, and at the same time the Schmidt gap\nreopens as expected. Fig. 4 shows that the Schmidt gap\nand the staggered magnetization scale very similarly. In\nfact in a recent work31 we have shown that, in proximity of the N\u00e9el-Haldane boundary, the two quantities Mzst\nand \u2206\u03bb scale with the same critical exponents and can be\ntherefore considered to be two possible order parameters\nfor the description of this transition.\nFinally, we have compared our numerical results approaching the point \u03b8 = \u03c0/4 and D = 0 known as\nthe Uimin-Lai-Sutherland (ULS) model43 with exact analytical calculations. The ULS model in the presence\nof a linear and a quadratic field was studied in44 and\nthe two critical values of D are D+ = 2.8284J and\nD\u2212 = \u22120.9800J. Notice that these values have been\n44\nobtained\n\u221a by dividing the corresponding results in by a\nfactor 2 because of the different Hamiltonian definition\nin our model. Our estimates are D+ = 2.83 \u00b1 0.05 and\nD\u2212 = \u22120.95\u00b10.05 which are in excellent agreement with\nthe analytical predictions.\n\nE.\n\nThe Ferromagnetic phases\n\nThe system is in a trivial ferromagnetic phase for D <\n0 and for \u2212\u03c0 < \u03b8 < \u22123\u03c0/4 and \u03c0/2 < \u03b8 < \u03c0. In this Ising\nferromagnetic phase, the model is\nPcharacterized by a non\nzero magnetization Mz = 1/L n Szn along z (except\nalong the line D = 0, where the magnetization could be\nin any direction).\nOn the contrary, for the same values of \u03b8 but for\nD > 0, the net magnetization is zero along any direction.

Although the \"in plane\" magnetization is zero, since the\nsystem is one dimensional, the correlations in the XY\nplane decay algebraically as shown in Fig. 5. To find the\nboundary between the XY-Ferromagnetic phase and the\nlarge D phase we study the magnetic structure factor for\nthe XX correlations:\n\nSx (q) =\n\n1X\nexp[iq(m \u2212 n)]hSxm Sxn i\nL mn\n\n(11)\n\nIn the XY -Ferromagnetic phase, the correlations are expected to decay as hSxn Sx(n+r) i \u223c r\u2212\u03b1 . It is very hard\nto extract an accurate value of \u03b1 by fitting the correlation functions. Instead, by considering that the magnetic\nstructure factor diverges for q = 0 with the system size:\nSx (q = 0) \u223c L1\u2212\u03b1 , one can better estimate \u03b1. In the\nlarge D phase, correlations decay exponentially with a\nfinite correlation length and the corresponding magnetic\nstructure factor Sx (q = 0) is independent of L. Therefore, in order to distinguish the XY -Ferromagnetic phase\nfrom the large D phase, it is sufficient to study the behavior of Sx (q = 0) with L and check whether it diverges\nor not. An example of such analysis is shown in Fig. 5\nfor \u03b8 = \u22120.8\u03c0 and D/J = 0.1. In the top panel the\ncorrelations hSxn Sx(n+r) i are shown for n = L/4 as a\nfunction of r. The value of n has been chosen so as to\nminimize finite size effects from the boundaries. In the\nbottom panel, we show the magnetic structure factor at\nzero momentum as a function of the system size.

We find interestingly enough that Critical A\nhas at least two different central charges c \u2243 1 and c \u2243 2,\neach identifying a different universality class45 . We base\nour results on the scaling of the von Neumann entropy\nwith the size of a partition of the chain. If \u03c1l is the reduced density matrix of a block of spins of length l when\nthe global state of L spins is the ground state, then the\nvon Neumann entropy is given by:\nS(l) = \u2212Tr\u03c1l log \u03c1l\n\n(12)\n\nFor critical points in one dimensional quantum spin\nchains, the von Neumann entropy scales logarithmically\n\n\f7\nS( L2 )\n2.5\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n1\n6\n\nlog L\n\u03c0\n\nFIG. 6: (Color online) von Neumann entropy at half chain for\n\u03b8 = 0.3\u03c0 and two values of D: D = \u22122J (circles) and D = 0\n(squares).

Our\nresults for S(L/2) computed at half chain are shown in\nFig. 6 for D = \u22122J and for D = 0 and \u03b8 = 0.3\u03c0. The\nbest fits of function (13) for D = \u22122J and for D = 0 give\nc = 1.09 and c = 1.91 respectively for the central charge.\nMoreover, our results are compatible with previous\nresults47 which obtained at \u03b8 = \u03c0/4 and D = 0 the\ncentral charge c = 1.995, which is compatible with the\nexpected result c = 2. On the other hand we expect, in\nthe limit |D/J| \u226b 1 and D negative, the central charge to\nbecome c = 1, in agreement with our numerical results.\nIn fact, our perturbative analysis of Sec. III A predicts\nthe model to be described by an effective XXZ spin 1/2\nchain in the critical region. A numerical estimate for\nthe central charge for this model is very close to c = 1\nas shown in Ref.48 . By studying the change in the estimated central charge for fixed \u03b8 and as a function of D\nwe find the line separating the two regions. Whether a\ncrossover or a phase transition separate the two regions,\nremains an open problem.\nThe boundaries of the Critical B phase are found by\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n4\n\nD. Jaksch and P. Zoller, Ann.

The nematic order parame2\nter Q = hSzi\ni \u2212 2/3 is different from zero in this phase.\nHowever, this is not sufficient to signal unamibiguously\nthis phase since Q is different from zero also in the dimer\nphase for D < 0. It is expected, as explained in Ref.16 ,\nthat this phase is characterized by enhanced nematic\ncorrelations. This should be also true for the Critical\nA phase in the limit of large negative D. Since these\nphases are gapless, accurate DMRG calculations are computationally hard to perform. Nevertheless, we compute\nthe block entropy in the Critical B phase for \u03b8 = \u22120.7\u03c0\nand D/J = \u22120.5 and obtain a central charge estimate:\nc = 0.99 which is compatible with the predicted result\nc = 1 valid in the limit of large negative D. This result is in agreement with Ref.16 in which a BerezinskiiKosterlitz-Thouless transition is predicted (see also38 ).\n\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nSummarizing, we have studied the complete phase diagram of the spin-1 chain in the presence of a uniaxial symmetry breaking field. Our study is based on the\ndensity matrix renomalization group (DMRG) algorithm\nwhere finite size effects have been carefully taked into\naccount to determine the phase boundaries with accuracy. Our results compare well to previous results of\nsome points in the phase diagram calculated by quantum\nMonte Carlo algorithms, and agree qualitatively with the\nrecent study presented in16 . Furthermore, our numerical\nresults for large negative value of the anisotropy, coincide\nwith those predicted by an effective spin-1/2 XXZ model\nthat we obtain as a limit of degenerated perturbation theory. Finally, we remark that the whole phase diagram is\nachievable with ultracold spinor gases by realizing that\nground states of antiferromagnetic phases can be mapped\nto the maximal energy states of ferromagnetic phases20 .\nAcknowledgments.\u2013 We thank R.
