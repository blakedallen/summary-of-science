Introduction\nChiral symmetry of massless Quantum Chromodynamics has turned to\nbe a key tool in order to deal with the low-energy domain of strong interactions (typically E \u223c M\u03c0 ) where hadron dynamics is not appropriately\ndescribed by partonic QCD. It is indeed the guiding principle in the construction of Chiral Perturbation Theory (\u03c7P T ) [1, 2, 3] that intends to be\nthe dual effective theory of QCD, i.e. it describes a perturbative quantum\nfield theory of strong interactions at low-energies.\nThe \u03c7P T Lagrangian involves a perturbative expansion guided by powers of external momenta (p) and light quark masses (m), with p \u223c m, over\na hadronic scale \u039b\u03c7 , driven by the loop expansion required by unitarity,\np2 /\u039b2\u03c7 or the one that rules the lightest heavier degrees of freedom omitted\nin the Lagrangian, as the \u03c1(770) mass, p2 /M\u03c12 . It includes the hadronic\nfields that live in this energy region, the multiplet of Goldstone bosons (\u03c0,\nK, \u03b7), and classical auxiliary fields that help to determine Green functions\nsatisfying the appropriate Ward identities. The theory can be systematically constructed by looking for all the operators that, with the ingredients\n\u2217\n\nIFIC/07-63.

As in any effective\nfield theory (EFT) this information is incorporated into the couplings of the\noperators :\n\nT\nL\u03c7P\n4\n\n=\n\n10\nX\ni=1\n\n(4)\nLi Oi\n\n,\n\nT\nL\u03c7P\n6\n\n=\n\n90\nX\n\n(6)\n\nCi Oi\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\ni=1\n\nfor SU (3). Explicit expressions for the operators can be read from Refs. [3,\n5]. In Eq. (2) Li and Ci are the chiral LECs at O(p4 ) and O(p6 ) respectively;\nthey are not provided by chiral symmetry. At present we do not know how\nto construct this Lagrangian directly from partonic QCD and, accordingly,\nwe do not know how to determine the LECs from that framework. Hence we\nhave to use our knowledge on the foundations of EFTs. LECs in \u03c7P T should\nreceive contributions from the energy regime at or above the scale that rules\nthe chiral perturbative expansion [6]. It is reasonable to infer that the dynamics of the lightest meson resonances in the hadronic spectrum, that are\nnot included explicitly in the Chiral Lagrangian, would provide the larger\ncontribution. Following this assumption the determination of the input of\nT\nthe resonance spectrum to the Li LECs in L\u03c7P\n[7] showed that they indeed\n4\nsaturate the values extracted from phenomenological analyses. As a consequence it is reasonable to think that the most important contribution to\nthe LECs is provided by the energy region immediately above the integrated\nscale (E \u223c \u039b\u03c7 \u223c M\u03c1 ).\nThe determination of LECs is crucial for the predictability of low-energy\nhadronic observables determined using \u03c7P T . In the last ten years many of\nthese processes have been evaluated up to O(p6 ) ([8] and references therein)\nbut our ignorance on the values of the involved LECs lessens the practical\n1\n\nIt happens that the loop expansion of the theory tells us that \u039b\u03c7 \u223c 4\u03c0F that is of\nthe same order than M\u03c1 . Hence there is only one scale in the perturbative expansion\nof the theory.\n\n\fustron07\n\nprinted on December 13, 2018\n\n3\n\nvalue of that enormous task. Therefore it is mandatory to explore procedures that allow us to determine or at least provide reliable estimates for\nthe values of chiral LECs up to O(p6 ).\n2. Tools : Large-NC and QCD asymptotic constraints\nAs illustrated in the O(p4 ) case [7, 9] a procedure to systematically disclose the structure of the resonance contributions to the LECs in \u03c7P T is\navailable. The key point is to construct a Lagrangian theory that includes\nresonances, Goldstone bosons and auxiliary fields respecting the underlying chiral symmetry. There are several tools that allow us to grab important properties of QCD and to implement them in an EFT-like Lagrangian\nmodel. Two relevant features to consider are :\ni) S. Weinberg [1] and H. Leutwyler [10] state that if one writes down the\nmost general Lagrangian, including all terms consistent with assumed symmetry principles, and then one calculates matrix elements with this Lagrangian to any given order of perturbation theory, the result will be the\nmost general possible S\u2013matrix amplitude consistent with analyticity, perturbative unitarity, cluster decomposition and the principles of symmetry\nthat have been required.\nii) The 1/NC coupling (NC is the number of colours in QCD) can be taken\nas a perturbative expansion parameter [11]. Indeed large-NC QCD shows\nfeatures that resemble, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the NC = 3\ncase [12]. In practice the consequences of this approach are that meson\ndynamics in the large-NC limit is described by tree diagrams of an effective\nlocal Lagrangian involving an infinite spectrum of zero-width mesons.\nBoth statements can be combined by constructing a Lagrangian in terms\nof SU (3) (Goldstone mesons) and U (3) (heavier resonances) flavour multiplets as explicit degrees of freedom respecting the underlying chiral symmetry. Then upon integration of the heavier states, the \u03c7P T Lagrangian is to\nbe recovered. This procedure has been systematically established [7, 9, 13]\nand devises what is known as Resonance Chiral Theory (R\u03c7T ). Its content\nis schematically given by :\nT\nLR\u03c7T = L\u03c7P\n+\n2\n\nX\n\nLGB\nn>2 + LR ,\n\n(3)\n\nn\n\u03c7P T\nT\n, L\u03c7P\n, ... in Eq. (2) though\nwhere LGB\nn>2 has the same structure than L4\n6\nwith different coupling constants, and LR involves terms with resonances\nand their couplings to Goldstone modes :\n\n1) The construction of the operators in the LR is guided by chiral symmetry\n\n\f4\n\nustron07\n\nprinted on December 13, 2018\n\nfor the Goldstone mesons and by unitary symmetry for the resonances. The\ngeneral structure of these couplings is :\nm\n\nO = h R1 R2 ...Rm \u03c7(pn ) i\n\n\u2208\n\nz }| {\n\n,\nLRR...R\n(n)\n\n(4)\n\nwhere Rj indicates a resonance field and \u03c7(pn ) is a chiral structured tensor,\ninvolving the pseudoscalar mesons and auxiliary fields only. With these settings chiral symmetry is preserved upon integration of the resonance fields\nand, at the same time, the low\u2013energy behaviour of the amplitudes is guaranteed.\n2) Symmetries do not provide information on the couplings in LR as these incorporate short-distance dynamics not included explicitly in the Lagrangian.\nThe latter is supposed to bridge between the energy region below resonances\n(E \u226a MV ) and the parton regime (E \u226b MV ). This hypothesis indicates\nthat it should match both regions and it satisfies, by construction, the chiral\nconstraints. To suit the high-energy behaviour one can match, for instance,\nthe OPE of Green functions (that are order parameters of chiral symmetry)\nwith the corresponding expressions evaluated within our theory. In addition the asymptotic trend of form factors of QCD currents is estimated from\nthe spectral structure of two-point functions and it is enforced on the observables. This heuristic strategy is well supported by the phenomenology\n[12, 13, 14, 15, 16] and provides information on the resonance couplings.\nR\u03c7T does not have an expansion parameter, hence it does not admit\na conventional perturbative treatment. There is of course the guide provided by 1/NC that translates into the loop expansion, however there is\nno counting that limits the number of operators with resonances that have\nto be included in the initial Lagrangian. The number of resonance fields\nto be kept relies essentially in the physical system that we are interested\nin. Moreover the maximum order of the chiral tensor \u03c7(pn ) in Eq. (4) is\nconstrained by the high\u2013energy behaviour.\nAs commented above large-NC requires, already at NC \u2192 \u221e, an infinite spectrum in order to match the leading QCD logarithms, though we\ndo not know how to implement this in a model-independent way. The\nusual approach in R\u03c7T is to include the lightest resonances because their\nphenomenological relevance, though there is no conceptual problem that\nprevents the addition of a finite number of multiplets. This cut in the spectrum may produce inconsistencies in the matching procedure outlined above\n[17]. To deal with this, one can include more multiplets that may delay the\nappearance of that problem.\n\n\fustron07\n\nprinted on December 13, 2018\n\n5\n\n3. Status and Prospects\nI comment briefly the present status and several developments on our\nknowledge of chiral LECs.\n3.1. O(p4 )\nContributions from the lightest multiplets of vector resonances (J P C =\nto SU (2) [2] and vector, axial-vector (1++ ), scalar (0++ ) and pseudoscalar (0\u2212+ ) resonances to SU (3) [7] LECs are in general good agreement\nwith those values extracted from observables [18], showing that those resonances saturate the phenomenological values. This has been lately confirmed by the inclusion of one multiplet of resonances with 2++ and 1+\u2212\nquantum numbers [19] that are shown to play, quantitatively, a minor role.\nA study of the strange quark mass dependence of the O(p4 ) SU (2) LECs\nr\n(li ) up to O(p6 ) has also been recently performed [20]. The authors essentially obtain :\n1\u2212\u2212 )\n\nlri = \u03b4i7\n\nF2\n+ ai + bi x + O(x2 ) , i = 1, ..., 7 ,\n8B0 ms\n\n(5)\n\n2 /(16\u03c0 2 F 2 ) and m is the mass of the strange quark. Here\nwhere x = MK\ns\nai = ai (Lj , lK ) arise at O(p4 ) and bi = bi (Lj , Ck , lK ) at O(p6 ), with lK =\n2 /\u03bc2 ). The dependence on the strange quark or kaon mass is expliclog(MK\nitly stated above. In addition, and for later discussion, the bi parameters\n2 with an explicit dependence\ncan be written as bi = p0,i + p1,i lK + p2,i lK\np0,i = p0,i (Lj Lk , Cl ), p1,i = p1,i (Lj ).\n\n3.2. O(p6 )\nIn Ref. [13] we have constructed the R\u03c7T Lagrangian needed to evaluate\nthe resonance contributions to the O(p6 ) LECs in Eq. (2). It can be shown\n(see Eq. (3)) have to vanish in order\n[9] that, at O(p4 ), all local terms in LGB\n4\nnot to spoil the asymptotic behaviour of QCD correlators. A corresponding\nresult at O(p6 ) is still lacking but we have also assumed that all the couplings\nin LGB\nare set to zero.\n6\nLR\u03c7T in Eq. (3) involves 124 a priori unknown couplings. Some additional work provides an enormous simplification :\ni) Upon integration of resonances not all couplings appear independently in\nthe LECs. In general only several combination of couplings intervene and\nto take into account this case one can perform suitable redefinitions of the\nfields. This procedure may upset the high-energy behaviour of the theory\n\n\f6\n\nustron07\n\nprinted on December 13, 2018\n\nbut it is correct for the evaluation of the LECs. Indeed the unknown couplings are reduced to 77.\nii) The next step is to enforce short-distance information, i.e. the leading behaviour at large momenta, for two and three-point functions and\nform factors. This procedure, set in Ref. [9], relies in well-known properties of partonic scattering or asymptotic QCD [21]. Two-current correlators\nand associated form-factors provide 19 new constraints on couplings, while\nthe three-point Green functions studied till now : hV AP i [15] and hSP P i\n[13, 16], give 6 and 5 independent restrictions, respectively. We are left with\n47 couplings. Further studies along this line can diminish even more the\nnumber of unknown constants.\nNotwithstanding we can already determine fully, at this point, the resonance contribution to the O(p6 ) couplings C78 and C89 (that appear in\n\u03c0 \u2192 l\u03bdl \u03b3 and \u03c0 \u2192 l\u03bdl \u03b3 \u2217 , respectively), C87 (in hA\u03bc A\u03bd i), C88 and C90 (in\nFV\u03c0 (q 2 ) and the q 2 dependence of the form factors in Kl3 ), C38 (in hSSi)\n0 \u2212\nand C12 and C34 (in FV\u03c0,K (q 2 ) and f+K \u03c0 (0)).\nThe evaluation of resonance contributions to Cj carried out in Ref. [13]\ncan be termed as an NC \u2192 \u221e evaluation (with a cut spectrum). It is interesting to notice that when the values obtained for Cj (namely CjR ) are\nsubstituted in the expressions obtained in Ref. [20] for p0,i , the different\ncombinations of Cj couplings vanish (except for i = 7) [22]. Something\nsimilar happens with the combinations of Li Lj products under additional\nconditions. The reason of these unexpected cancellations is still not understood and it would imply that, in the large-NC limit, resonance saturation\nof O(p4 ) SU (2) chiral LECs is already achieved at leading order. This\nwould be very much satisfactory both for the 1/NC expansion and for the\ndetermination of resonance contributions to chiral LECs. It is nice to have\nsomething left to understand for the future.\nAcknowledgements\nI wish to thank Michal Czakon, Henryk Czy\u017c and Janusz Gluza for the\nexcellent organization (but for the weather) of the XXXI International Conference of Theoretical Physics in Ustron (Poland).
