theory\nFabian Kopei\nAbstract\nWe interpret a formula for meromorphic functions on foliations by\nRiemann surfaces as an analogue to the product formula of valuations in\nalgebraic number theory.\n\nA meromorphic function on a compact Riemann surface has as many zeros as\npoles. This well-known geometric fact has an algebraic analogue: for a smooth\nalgebraic curve C and an element f of its function field we have\nX\nordP f = deg(div(f )) = 0.\n(1)\nP \u2208C\n\nIn the algebraic context a similar formula holds for the valuations of an\nalgebraic number field (i.e. a finite extensions of Q) or a separable function\nfield:\n\np\n\nX\n\nfinite\n\nlog |f |p +\np\n\nX\n\nX\nX\nlog |f |p = \u2212\nordp (f ) log N(p) +\nlog |f |p = 0,\np prime\ninfinite\np infinite\n\nwhere f is a non-zero element of the field and the sums run over the equivalence\nclasses of the finite or infinite valuations, respectively the prime-ideals of the\nring of integers.\nIn this article we want to search a geometric analogue for this formula.\nNeglecting for the moment the infinite primes, the structural difference to equation (1) is the factor log N(p). In an expected geometric analogon this is only\na property of the point P , not of the function f . Since it seems to be difficult\nto assign real values to points in a canonical way, we may try to replace the\npoint by the next simple geometric object, a line, to which we assign its length\nmeasured by a flow. But a meromorphic function has only isolated zeros and\npoles, so this line should come with a transverse structure. The simplest object\nrealizing this seems to be a 3-dimensional foliation by Riemann surfaces. Assuming that the flow and the foliation are compatible with each other, we may\ntherefore expect the following\nProposition. Let M be an oriented, closed 3-manifold, F a leafwise oriented\nfoliation by Riemann surfaces and \u03a6 a transverse foliation-invariant flow. Let\nf : M \u2212\u2192 CP1\n1\n\n\fbe a smooth function which is meromorphic on the leaves, such that the zeros\nand poles lie only on finitely many closed orbits \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3n .\nThen on these orbits ord\u03b3i f is constant and we have\nn\nX\n\nl(\u03b3i )ord\u03b3i f = 0,\n\ni=1\n\nwhere l(\u03b3i ) denotes the length of the orbit, i.e. the smallest return time.\nRemark. The proposition is a special case of a well-known theorem for laminations: the harmonic measure of zeros minus that of poles is equal to the\nintegrated Chern class, see [Gh 99]. For similar formulas see [Co 82], [Hu 88].\nRemark. For a more general definition of meromorphic functions see for example\n[Gh 99], concerning their existence see [Gh 99], [De 04].\nSo for the case of no infinite primes we found a geometric analogue: here elements of the field correspond to meromorphic functions modulo C\u2217 and primes\ncorrespond to closed orbits with length log N(p).\nThe infinite primes are something like a compactification of the finite ones.\nFor an analogue we may therefore try to take a noncompact space, which we\nthen compactify. The simplest example is, that we have to complete our foliation\nby a finite number of compact leaves, on which the flow is not transverse. We\nget then an analogue for the case of infinite primes:\nProposition. Let M be an oriented, closed 3-manifold, F a leafwise oriented\nfoliation by Riemann surfaces and \u03a6 an foliation-invariant flow. We assume\nthat the flow is up to a finite number of compact leaves (Lj )j=1,...,k transverse.\nLet\nf : M \\ \u222aj Lj \u2192 CP1\nbe a smooth function which is meromorphic on the leaves, such that the zeros\nand poles lie only on finitely many closed, transverse orbits \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3n . Let \u03c9 be\nthe on M \\ \u222aj Lj defined 1-form, which is zero on the integrable distribution of\nthe foliation and one on the vector field generated by the flow. We set\n\u03b7 :=\n\n1\ndF f \u2227 \u03c9,\nf\n\nwhere dF is the differential along the leaves. Let T Lj be pairwise distinct compact tubular neighbourhoods of the leaves Lj , such that the \u03b3i and the T Lj are\npairwise distinct. Then\nn\nX\n\nl(\u03b3i )ord\u03b3i f = \u2212\n\ni=1\n\nZ\nk\nX\n1\n\u03b7.\n2\u03c0i \u2202T Lj\nj=1\n\nThe proof is a simple adaption of [Gh 99].\n\n2\n\n\fProof. It is an easy application of the theorem of Cauchy, that ord\u03b3i f is constant\non the orbits.\nFor each \u03b3i we take distinct, orientation preserving tubular neighbourhoods\n\u03b9i : S 1 \u00d7 D \u0592\u2192 M \\ \u222aj Lj ,\nwhere D \u2282 C is the 2-dimensional disc, which respect the foliation, i.e. \u03b9({t}\u00d7D)\nlies in a leaf ([CC 00], p. 89). We have\nZ\n\n\u03b7=\n\n\u03b9i (S 1 \u00d7\u2202D)\n\nZ\n\nS 1 \u00d7\u2202D\n\n\u2217\n(\u03b9\u22121\ni ) (\u03b7)\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nl(\u03b3i )\n\ndt\n\n0\n\nI\n\nf \u2032 (\u03b9i (z, t))\ndz = 2\u03c0i l(\u03b3i )ord\u03b3i f,\nf (\u03b9i (z, t))\n\nwhere the last equation is a consequence of the theorem of the zeros and poles\ncounting integral.\nSo if \u0393i denotes the image of \u03b9i , we have on the one hand\nn Z\nX\ni=1\n\n\u03b7 = 2\u03c0i\n\u2202\u0393i\n\nn\nX\n\nl(\u03b3i )ord\u03b3i f.\n\ni=1\n\nOn the other hand by the theorem of Stokes and the fact that \u03b7 is closed we\nhave\nn Z\nX\ni=1\n\n\u2202\u0393i\n\n\u03b7+\n\nk Z\nX\nj=1\n\n\u2202T Lj\n\n\u03b7=\u2212\n\nZ\n\n\u03b7=\u2212\n\n\u2202(M\\(\u222ai \u0393i \u222aj T Lj ))\n\nZ\n\nd\u03b7 = 0.\n\nM\\(\u222ai \u0393i \u222aj T Lj )\n\nThe combination of these two equations proves the proposition.\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark. In this article we wanted to point out a similarity between certain\nfoliations and number theory in a self-contained way. But of course this work\nis strongly influenced by an elaborate conjecture, in which Deninger postulates\na deep relation between these objects (see for example [De 01]). The work of\nDeninger suggests also a correspondence between infinite primes and compact,\nnon-transversal leaves.\n\nReferences\n[CC 00] Candel, Alberto; Conlon, Lawrence: Foliations I.
