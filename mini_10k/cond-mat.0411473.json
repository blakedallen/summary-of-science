Introduction\n\n2. Quantum Monte Carlo simulations\n\nInterest in the properties, phase transitions and various phases of strongly correlated systems in reduced dimensionality has a very long history in condensed matter\nphysics. The experimental realization of Bose-Einstein\ncondensates (BEC) in traps1 offered the possibility of\nstudying such phenomena in precisely engineered systems. This goal was eventually achieved by placing the\ncondensates on optical lattices2, 3 which has the effect\nof packing the bosonic atoms in close proximity to one\nanother and even producing multiple occupancy of lattice sites. Consequently, strongly correlated systems are\nproduced on such optical lattices which have the advantage of being defect free. However, the lattices are immersed in the confining trap and are consequently not\ntranslationally invariant. This makes delicate the task of\napplying results known in condensed matter physics for\ntranslationally invariant systems to BEC on optical lattices. The rush to do this has led to some misunderstandings especially concerning \"quantum phase transitions\"\non the optical lattice.\nOur goal here is to use quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)\nmethods, such as the stochastic series expansion (SSE)\nand the worm algorithm, to study in some detail the\nproperties of BEC on optical lattices and elucidate the\nnature of the observed \"transition\".\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we\nintroduce the bosonic Hubbard model used for the description of a cold atomic Bose gas trapped on optical\nlattices and discuss and compare the techniques to simulate it. We then review the results presented in Ref. 4\nin section 3, focusing on observables particularly suited\nfor the detection of local \"phases\" or structures and the\nabsence of quantum criticality in these inhomogeneous\nsystems. In section 4, new results on the transition to a\nTonks-Girardeau gas regime for bosonic systems in onedimension are presented.\n\n2.1 Model\nWe consider the following Bose Hubbard Hamiltonian\n\u0011\nX\u0010 \u2020\nH = \u2212t\nbi bj + h.c.\n(1)\nhi,ji\n\n+\n\nX\nX\nUX\nni ,\nri2 ni \u2212 \u03bc\nni (ni \u2212 1) + V\n2 i\ni\ni\n\nas a good description of the low energy physics of cold\nconfined bosonic gases.5 Here t is the nearest neighbor\nhopping, U the onsite repulsion between the softcore\nbosons, \u03bc the chemical potential and V the curvature\nof the parabolic confining potential imposed by the trap.\nWe use standard notations for the bosonic operators. We\n2\nfurthermore define \u03bceff\ni = \u03bc\u2212V ri , which is the local effective chemical potential experienced by a boson at site i.\n2.2 Quantum Monte Carlo\nThe Hamiltonian (1) is particularly well suited for simulations using QMC techniques. Indeed and to our best\nknowledge, such techniques are the only ones able to simulate efficiently the Hamiltonian (1) for the following reasons :\n\u2022 They work in any dimension (unlike the density\nmatrix renormalization group (DMRG) which is restricted to one-dimensional systems).\n\u2022 They can be used to obtain both finite and zero\ntemperature properties.\n\u2022 They allow the simulation of non homogeneous trapping potentials (unlike series expansion).\n\u2022 Large system sizes can be reached (unlike using exact diagonalization).\n\u2022 They perform an exact treatment of all terms in the\nHamiltonian (1) (unlike most analytic approaches).\n\n\f=\n\n=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\u03b2n\nTr(\u2212H)n\nTr exp(\u2212\u03b2H) =\nn!\nn=0\n\u221e\nX\n\u03b2n\nn!\nn=0\n\nX\n\n(2)\n\nlocal\n\n2\u22c510\n\n1\u22c510\n\n(worm)\n\n\u22126\n\nlocal\n\n3\u22c510\n\n1\n\n2D trap\n\u03bc/U = 0.25\nV/U = 0.0025\nt/U = 0.03\n\n(SSE) / \u2206\u03ba\n\n(R) (radial mean)\n\n4\u22c510\n\n\u2206\u03ba\n\nEfficiency of non-local quantum Monte Carlo\nmethods\nWe used the most recent world-line QMC algorithms,\nthe SSE algorithm6 with directed loops7, 8 and the worm\nalgorithm9 to perform the simulations based on the open\nsource implementations of the ALPS project.10\nThe SSE representation6 starts from a Taylor expansion of the partition function in orders of the inverse\ntemperature \u03b2:\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22126\n\nSSE\nworm\n\nlocal\n\n2.3\n\nZ\n\nAuthor Name\n\nFull Paper\n\n\u22126\n\n0.8\n\n4\n3\n\n0.6\n\n2\n1\n0\n\n0.4\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\nR/L\n\nn(R) (radial mean)\n\nJ.

For the simulation\nof trapped bosonic systems we are naturally interested\nin the limit where the diagonal matrix elements (e.g. the\ntrapping potential) are large. In this limit the SSE sampling can face a considerable slowdown as the probability of exchanging off-diagonal and diagonal bond terms\nin the Hamiltonian is suppressed. On the contrary, the\nworm algorithm9 samples world lines in the path integral\nrepresentation of the partition function which treats only\nthe off-diagonal terms in the Hamiltonian as a perturbation\n\u0011\n\u0010\nR\u03b2\n\u0001\nZ = Tr e\u2212\u03b2H = Tr e\u2212\u03b2H0 Te\u2212 0 d\u03c4 V (\u03c4 ) .\n(3)\n\nThe directed loop and worm algorithms both work in\nan extended configuration space, which in addition to\nclosed world line configurations, allows for the presence\nof an open world line fragment, the \"worm\" or \"directed\nloop\", which is formally introduced by adding a source\nterm to the Hamiltonian\nX\n(b+\n(4)\nHworm = H \u2212 \u03b7\ni + bi ) .\ni\n\nThis source term allows the world lines to be broken\nwith a matrix element proportional to \u03b7. To generate\nnew closed loop configurations in the sampling process, a\nworm is created and a random sequence of local updates\nof the worm is performed where each move fulfills detailed balance. Nevertheless, this update procedure can\nperform non-local changes of the world line configurations as the worm can wind around the lattice in the\ntemporal or spatial direction and thereby change the particle or winding number respectively.\nTo discuss the computational performance of the\ntwo QMC algorithms in simulating confined ultra-cold\nbosonic atoms in two dimensions we compare the statistical error obtained for the Monte Carlo estimates of\nobservables from simulation runs with a fixed amount\n\nFig. 1. Comparison of the statistical error \u2206\u03balocal of the local\ncompressibility \u03balocal of a 2D trap with 35 \u00d7 35 sites obtained\nfrom simulation runs with fixed CPU-time for stochastic series\nexpansion (SSE) quantum Monte Carlo and the worm algorithm.\nThe error bars are obtained by averaging over estimates with\nidentical radial distance. The inset shows the ratio of statistical\nerrors \u2206\u03balocal (SSE)/\u2206\u03balocal (worm) for the two algorithms using\nthe open-source implementations of the ALPS project.10\n\nof CPU time (typically around 100 CPU hours on an\nOpteron 1.8 GHz processor).\nWhile in the homogenous Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian\nwithout confining potential the SSE representation is\nfound to perform better, except from the extreme softcore case,11 the situation is different when simulating\nharmonic traps. In Fig. 1 results of our simulations are\nshown for a two-dimensional system with 35 \u00d7 35 sites\nand trap parameters which allow for a Mott plateau\nwith integer density (hni i = 1) in the center of the trap\n(R/L . 0.2). Before discussing the physics of this system\nin the next sections we first consider the statistical error of the local compressibility \u03balocal (defined by Eq. (5),\nbelow), which is shown in Fig. 1 as a function of the distance from the trap center. While for both algorithms\nthe statistical error is largest for the superfluid ring surrounding the central Mott plateau (0.2 . R . 0.4), the\nworm algorithm yields a statistical error which is a factor\nof 3 smaller than the one obtained for the SSE estimate\nwith the same amount of CPU-time. The superior performance of the worm algorithm is a consequence of the\nsmall ratio of off-diagonal to diagonal matrix elements\nfor the used value of t/U = 0.03 in the simulated BoseHubbard Hamiltonian. Further reducing this ratio, e.g. to\nstudy trapped bosonic systems which exhibit more than\none Mott plateau, will result in an even larger speedup\nof the worm algorithm.\nFig. 2 shows the ratio of statistical errors of QMC\nestimates for three different observables obtained using\nthe SSE and worm algorithm. The statistical errors are\nshown versus the number of lattice sites. For the particle\nnumber n and the compressibility \u03balocal (c.f. Eq. (5)) spatial averages are shown. There appears to be a constant\nimprovement of the worm code over the SSE algorithm,\nindependent of the system size, implying that both algorithms exhibit the same scaling in system size. From our\nsimulations we conclude that the worm algorithm is the\nsuperior QMC technique to simulate trapped ultra-cold\n\n\fJ. Phys. Soc.

This can be understood on qualitative grounds by looking at density\nprofiles: a region of space with constant integer density\nof particles is interpreted as a Mott insulating region\n(a Mott plateau), while non-integer densities correspond\nto superfluid regions. To distinguish the state near a\ngiven site more precisely, we proposed a more quantitative probe, which will be reviewed here.4\nFor the homogeneous case, the Mott insulating phase\nhas a vanishing compressibility \u03ba.13 One way of locally\ncharacterizing a region of space in the inhomogeneous\nsystem is to study the local compressibility at a given\nlattice-site i:\n\u001d\n\u001c\n\u2202n\nlocal\n= \u03b2 (hni ni \u2212 hni ihni) ,\n(5)\n\u03bai\n=\n\u2202\u03bceff\ni\n\ncoherence fraction, n(0,0)\n\n3.1\n\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\nU/t\n\n30\n\n40\n\nFig. 4.

The ratio U/t at which a\nMott plateau forms in the center of the trap is marked\nby a vertical line. Whereas the coherence fraction does\nnot show any specific feature at the threshold for Mott\nplateau formation, we observe a change of the curvature\nin the FWHM at this point. It was shown,4 that this appears as a generic feature and that the FWHM can thus\nserve as an indicator of Mott plateau formation in a confined Bose gas. We also showed that the appearance of\nfine structure in the momentum distribution (secondary\npeaks) is not related to the Mott plateau formation, disproving claims in previous work.14\n\nof curves indicates that indeed the ladder model captures\nthe essential physics of the trapped two-dimensional system. The density curves from the trap and the ladder\nmodel coincide almost perfectly, indicating the validity\nof a local density approximation.4 There are small differences in the local compressibility between the trap and\nthe ladder system, which are due to the different shape\nof the local chemical potential in the two systems. Nevertheless, the two different compressibility curves share\nthe same overall shape.\nHaving shown that the ladder model describes correctly the different physical features found in the trapped\nsystem, we can study the occurrence of quantum criticality in this simpler model. In Fig. 6, the local density and the local compressibility of the ladder model\nare shown for two different system sizes. We observe two\nvery broad peaks in the compressibility, which might indicate quantum critical behavior. However, these peaks\ndo not sharpen upon increasing the length of the ladder,\nas seen in Fig. 6. The inset of Fig. 6 displays the compressibility of a one-dimensional chain which, in contrast\nwith the ladder results, displays very sharp peaks at the\ninsulating-superfluid phase transition, even for a system\nof moderate size (L = 64).\nWe thus find that no one-dimensional quantum critical\nbehavior is found in the realistically simulated trapped\nsystems. This is in agreement with the absence of \"critical slowing down\" observed in the experiments.2, 3 We\nthus interpret the \"quantum phase transition\" seen in the\nexperiments as a crossover of changing fractions of the\nMott-insulating and superfluid regions. Critical behavior\ncould however be observed for flat confining potentials.\nFor a more elaborate discussion on the ladder model and\nthe absence of quantum criticality, we refer the reader to\nRef. 4.\n\n3.2 Absence of quantum criticality\nFig. 3 suggests that the superfluid region identified\nby a non vanishing local compressibility is confined to\na shell around the central Mott-insulating region. One\nmight then expect that in a two-dimensional trap this\nshell essentially behaves like a one-dimensional bosonic\nchain, and displays similar quantum critical behavior.\nFor example, the compressibility of a one-dimensional\nbosonic chain diverges at the superfluid-insulator transition.15 However, simulations in a trap indicate no critical\nfeatures in quantities like the local compressibility.4\nTo further investigate this phenomenon and to simplify simulations, an effective bosonic ladder model was\nintroduced in Ref. 4, that represents the superfluid ring\nin the original two-dimensional trap. In this model, each\nleg of the ladder is assigned a different chemical potential, which is chosen such that the first leg is always in\na hni = 0 Mott insulating phase and the last leg in the\nhni = 1 Mott insulating phase. The chemical potential\nis then interpolated (for example linearly) between these\ntwo values for the other legs of the ladder.\nIn Fig. 5, we show the local density and the local compressibility \u03balocal as a function of the effective chemical\npotential \u03bceff for both simulations, the 2d trap and the\nladder model.

We\nperformed simulations for chains of Ns = 50 lattice sites,\ntypical for experimental setup,21 and considered different\nfillings of the system by adjusting the chemical potential.\nAn appropriate means of quantifying the relevance of\nthe interactions in the presence of an optical lattice is the\nratio U/t, given in terms of the microscopic model parameters.23 To a given value of U/t, an associated effective value of \u03b3eff = U/(2thni) is obtained by determining\nthe particle density hni during the simulation.24\nIn Fig. 7 the QMC results for \u03b3eff are shown as a function of U/t for \u03bc/t = 0 and 0.3. For a given value of U/t,\nthe effective value of the interactions, \u03b3eff , is larger for\n\u03bc/t = 0 than for \u03bc/t = 0.3, due to a lower bosonic density\nin the first case. We thus expect the behavior of softcore\nbosons to fit well to that of a Tonks-Girardeau gas for\nsmaller values of U/t for \u03bc/t = 0 than for \u03bc/t = 0.3.\nIn Fig. 8 (a,b) the spatial density distribution , n(x),\nand the momentum distribution function, n(k), are\nshown in the low-density regime for \u03bc/t = 0, with no\nMott-insulating region present in the trap. We find that\nfor U/t = 50 both quantities are already close to the\nhardcore limit. Data taken at U/t = 100 (not shown) did\nnot exhibit any visible difference to the hardcore limit in\nthis regime. In contrast, for U = 5 the density in the trap\n\n500\n\nn\n\n4.1 The Tonks-Girardeau gas\nIn previous sections, we studied properties of confined ultra-cold bosonic atoms in optical lattices using\nthe Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian with an on-site repulsion\nU/t. In the limit of infinite repulsion, U/t \u2192 \u221e, this\nmodel maps onto a model of hardcore bosons which are\nconstrained to a maximum occupancy of one boson per\nsite. In the continuum limit of the one-dimensional Bose\ngas, the regime of infinite repulsion defines the TonksGirardeau gas,16, 17 which in many respects behaves similar to fermions due to the enforced impenetrability. The\nrealization of a Tonks-Girardeau gas in trapped bosonic\natom systems18 initially turned out difficult, due to the\nrestricted interaction range accessible from the experimental setup.19, 20 However, recently Tonks-Girardeau\ngas behavior was observed in one-dimensional Bose gases\nin the presence of an optical lattice potential.21 The underlying lattice structure increases the effective mass of\nthe bosons, thus increasing the ratio \u03b3 = Eint /Ekin , of\ninteraction energy (Eint ) to kinetic energy (Ekin ).21 In\nparticular, excellent agreement between the experimental data and calculations based on the fermionization\napproach to the Tonks-Girardeau gas was obtained in\nRef. 21, already for values of \u03b3 \u2248 5. In another recent\nstudy,22 observation of Tonks-Girardeau gas behavior\nwas reported for similar value of \u03b3 \u2248 5 also in the absence\nof an optical lattice.\n\nU/t=5\nU/t=10\nU/t=50\nhardcore\n\n0.4\nU/t=5\nU/t=10\nU/t=50\nhardcore\n\n0.2\n0.0\n\n-10\n\n0\n\nx/a\n\n10\n\n0.001\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\nka/\u03c0\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n0.01\n\nFig. 8.

One might thus conclude, as in Ref. 25, that large values of \u03b3 > 100 are\nneeded before the behavior of softcore bosons fits well to\nthat of a Tonks-Girardeau gas. Observing that near the\nboundary of the system, the density distributions is close\nin all cases and that due to the low density of bosons in\nthis regime, the value of U is irrelevant, we prefer a different look at this problem.\nFor a more detailed analysis, we\nP plot the averaged\nsquared deviation \u01ebn (U ) = 1/Ns i (ni (U ) \u2212 ni (U =\n\u221e))2 as a function of U/t in the inset of Fig. 7.

Density distribution, n(x), and momentum distribution\nfunction, n(k), in the ground state of softcore bosons on onedimensional optical lattices for different values of U/t = 5, 10,\n50, and for hardcore bosons (U/t = \u221e), inside a harmonic confinement potential of strength V /t = 10\u22123 and for \u03bc/t = 0.3.\n\nthat no finite critical value for U/t exists.\nConsidering the momentum distribution function n(k)\nshown in Fig. 8 (b), we find that they are similar\nto the hardcore limit for all values of U/t in this\nintermediate-density regime. The main differences occur\nfor the plateau value near k = 0, whereas the characteristic slopes of the curves around k/a \u2248 \u03c0/221 are insensitive to the value of U/t. Due to this similar structure,\nand since the overall scale of n(k) is not fixed by the experimental data, the measured momentum profiles could\nbe fitted in Ref. 21 to the momentum profile of hardcore\nbosons already for moderate values of \u03b3. Experimentally\nit is thus difficult to distinguish the softcore regime from\nthe hardcore limit in the low-density region, and behavior similar to a Tonks-Girardeau gas emerges already for\nmoderate values of \u03b3 > 5, as observed in Ref. 21.\nNext, we consider the case of an increased bosonic density inside the trap, obtained by increasing the chemical\npotential. In particular, we consider \u03bc/t = 0.3, and show\nresults for the local density and momentum distribution\nfunction in Fig. 9. As seen from Fig. 9 (a), hardcore\nbosons develop an extended Mott plateau in the trap\ncenter for this value of \u03bc. Plateau formation is observed\nfor softcore bosons only for values of U/t > 10. Furthermore, the algebraic decrease in \u01ebn (U ) upon increasing U\nfound for \u03bc/t = 0 is also observed for \u03bc/t = 0.3 and\nwith the same exponent of \u03b1 \u2248 2. Turning to the momentum distribution functions, we find from Fig. 9 (b),\nthat the momentum profile for U/t = 5 and 10 now show\nsignificant quantitative differences to the one in the hardcore limit. In particular, the characteristic slopes of the\ncurves near k/a \u2248 \u03c0/2 now differ significantly from the\nhardcore case. For high bosonic densities, the differences\nbetween softcore and hardcore behavior are thus more\npronounced, and easier detectable by measuring the experimentally accessible momentum profile.\n5. Conclusion\nThe main new results of the present paper concern the\ncrossover of softcore bosons into the Tonks-Girardeau\n\nAuthor Name\n\nregime. From our simulations we conclude that this\ncrossover appears smooth, and that no finite critical\nvalue of the interaction strength U/t exists. Instead,\nupon increasing U/t, differences in the local density distributions between the softcore and hardcore case decrease algebraically, with an exponent that is insensitive\nto the density inside the trap.\nIn the low-density region, the shape momentum profiles of softcore bosons are qualitatively very similar to\nthose observed in the Tonks-Girardeau gas already for\nmoderate values of U/t. This explains the observation in\nRef. 21, where the measured momentum profiles could\nwell be fitted using a fermionization approach to the\nTonks-Girardeau gas for \u03b3 > 5. The value of \u03b3 or U/t beyond which an experiment is well described by a TonksGirardeau gas picture depends sensitively on the quantity being measured, the measurement error and the density of bosons. In particular in the low-density region, we\nfind the momentum profile to be rather insensitive to the\nvalue of U/t, allowing a description of the softcore boson system in terms of a Tonks-Girardeau gas already\nat small values of \u03b3. For larger densities, the additional\nconfinement of the superfluid in the hardcore limit leads\nto quantitative differences in the momentum profile between softcore and hardcore bosons and thus larger values of U/t are needed in order to observe the behavior of\na Tonks-Girardeau gas.\nAcknowledgments\nThe numerical calculations were performed using the\nSSE application package with generalized directed loop\ntechniques8 and the worm code application package of\nthe ALPS project,10 and carried out on the Asgard and\nHreidar Beowulf clusters at ETH Z\u00fcrich.\nWe thank M.A. Cazalilla, P.
