In\norder to reproduce these lepton and quark mixings, mass matrices of various structures with\ntexture zeros have been investigated in the literature[2]-[4]. Recently a mass matrix model\nbased on a discrete symmetry Z3 and a flavor 2 \u2194 3 symmetry has been proposed[5] with\nfollowing universal structure for all quarks\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec 0\n\uf8ec\nP\u2020 \uf8ec A\n\uf8ed\nA\n\nand leptons\n\uf8f6\nA A\uf8f7\n\uf8f7 \u2020\nB C \uf8f7P ,\n\uf8f8\nC B\n\n(1)\n\nwhere P is a diagonal phase factor. It was pointed out[5] that this structure leads to\nreasonable values of the Cabibbo\u2013Kobayashi\u2013Maskawa (CKM) [6] quark mixing as well as\nlepton mixing. An assignment (we refer it as Type A) for the texture components with A =\np\n\u00b1 m22m1 , B = 21 (m3 + m2 \u2212 m1 ), and C = \u2212 12 (m3 \u2212 m2 + m1 ) with the i-th genaration\nmass mi has been proposed both for up and down quarks in Ref.[5]. Unfortunately, the\ntype A assignment leads to a somewhat small predicted value for the CKM quark mixing\nmatrix element |Vub| = 0.0020 \u2212 0.0029 with respect to the present experimental value\n|Vub | = 0.0036 \u00b1 0.0007[7]. Subsequently, it has been pointed out[8] that there exist other\npossible new assignments for texture components and that the combination of the new\np\nassignment(we refer it Type B) with A = \u00b1 m32m1 , B = 12 (m3 + m2 \u2212 m1 ), and C =\n1\n2\n\n(m3 \u2212 m2 \u2212 m1 ) for up quarks, and the previously proposed type A assignment for down\n\nquarks is phenomenologically favorable for reproducing the consistent values of CKM quark\nmixing. By taking the type A assignment both for neutrinos and charged leptons, the\nauthors in Ref. [5] have obtained the consistent values for the lepton mixing matrix of the\nmodel with the present experimental data . In the present paper, stimulated by the success\nin the quark sector, we discuss the neutrino masses and lepton mixings of the model with\nuse of the new assignments for charged leptons and neutrions.\nOur mass matrices Mu , Md , M\u03bd , and Me for up quarks (u, c, t), down quarks (d, s, b),\nneutrinos (\u03bde , \u03bd\u03bc , \u03bd\u03c4 ) and charged leptons (e, \u03bc, \u03c4 ), respectively are given as follows[5]:\ncf P \u2020 ,\nMf = Pf\u2020 M\nf\n\n2\n\n(2)\n\n\fwith\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n0\nAf Af\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\ncf = \uf8ec A B C \uf8f7\nM\nf\nf \uf8f7 (f = u, d, \u03bd, e) ,\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed f\nAf Cf Bf\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Pf is the diagonal phase matrix and Af , Bf , and Cf are real parameters.\nHereafter, for brevity, we will omit the flavor index. The eigenmasses of Eq. (3) are given\nh\nh\ni\ni\np\np\nby 21 B + C \u2212 8A2 + (B + C)2 , 12 B + C + 8A2 + (B + C)2 , and B \u2212C.

However,\n\nThis type is not useful in the following discussions.\nThe type B and type C are new assignments proposed in Ref.[8]. Taking the type B\nassignment for up quarks and the type A for down quarks, we have obtained consistent\nvalues for the CKM quark mixing matrix in Ref.[8]. Stimulated by the above new assignment,\nKoide[9] has proposed a new universal texture of quark and lepton mass matrices which is\nan extension of our model with an extended flavor 2 \u2194 3 symmetry.\nNow let us discuss the lepton mixing matrix of the model. In our model, M\u03bd and Me\nhave the same zero texture with same or different assignments as follows:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0 A\u03bd A\u03bd\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\nM\u03bd = P\u03bd\u2020 \uf8ec A\u03bd B\u03bd C\u03bd \uf8f7 P\u03bd\u2020 ,\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\nA\u03bd C\u03bd B\u03bd\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec 0 Ae Ae \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\nMe = Pe\u2020 \uf8ec Ae Be Ce \uf8f7 Pe\u2020 ,\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\nAe Ce Be\n\n(14)\n\n(15)\n\nwhere P\u03bd and Pe are the CP -violating phase factors. We find that the assignments that are\nconsistent with the present experimental data are following two cases:\nCase(i): Type A assignment both for neutrinos and charged leptons are taken.\nCase(ii): Type B assignment for neutrinos and type A for charged leptons are taken.\nThe other possible cases fail to reproduce consistent lepton mixing. Since the case(i) was\ncf P \u2020 (f =\ndiscussed in Ref.[5], let us discuss the case(ii) in this paper.

Therefore, the independent parameters\nin |Uij | are \u03b8e\u2032 = tan\u22121 (me /m\u03c4 ), \u03b8\u03bd = tan\u22121 (m1 /m2 ), and (\u03b4\u03bd3 \u2212\u03b4\u03bd2 ). Since \u03b8e\u2032 is already fixed\nby the charged lepton masses, \u03b8\u03bd and (\u03b4\u03bd3 \u2212 \u03b4\u03bd2 ) are adjustable parameters in our model.\nLet us estimate the values of \u03b8\u03bd and (\u03b4\u03bd3 \u2212 \u03b4\u03bd2 ) by fitting the experimental data. In\nthe following discussions we consider the normal mass hierarchy \u2206m223 = m23 \u2212 m22 > 0 for\nthe neutrino mass. In this situation, we can ignore the evolution effects. They only give\nsmall correction effects enough to be neglected. Generally speaking, we must consider the\nrenormalization group equation (RGE) effect when the neutrino masses have the inverse\nhierarchy or almost degenerate (m1 \u2243 m2 ). However, these scenarios are denied from (21)\n5\n\n\fand (26). Hence, the neutrino masses must have the normal mass hierarchy and we do not\nneed to consider the RGE effects.\nWhen we use the expressions (19)-(23) at the weak scale, the parameters \u03b4\u03bd2 and \u03b4\u03bd3 do\nnot mean the phases that are evolved from those at the unification scale. Hereafter, we use\nthe parameters \u03b4\u03bd2 and \u03b4\u03bd3 as phenomenological parameters that approximately satisfy the\nrelations (19)-(23) at the weak scale.\nWe have[11]\n|U13 |2exp < 0.054 ,\n\n(24)\n\nfrom the CHOOZ[12], solar[13], and atmospheric neutrino experiments[1] with 3\u03c3 range.\nFrom the global analysis of the SNO solar neutrino experiment[11, 13] with 3\u03c3 range, we\nhave\n\u2206m212 = m22 \u2212 m21 = \u2206m2sol = (5.2 \u2212 9.8) \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2 ,\n\n(25)\n\ntan2 \u03b812 = tan2 \u03b8sol = 0.29 \u2212 0.64 ,\n\n(26)\n\nfor the large mixing angle (LMA) MSW solution.\n\nFrom the atmospheric neutrino\n\nexperiment[1, 11], we also have\n\u2206m223 = m23 \u2212 m22 \u2243 \u2206m2atm = (1.4 \u2212 3.4) \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 ,\ntan2 \u03b823 \u2243 tan2 \u03b8atm = 0.49 \u2212 2.2 ,\n\n(27)\n(28)\n\nwith 3\u03c3 range. The observed fact tan2 \u03b8atm \u2243 1.0 highly suggests \u03b4\u03bd3 \u2212 \u03b4\u03bd2 \u2243 \u03c0/2. Hereafter,\nfor simplicity, we take\n\u03b4\u03bd3 \u2212 \u03b4\u03bd2 =\n\n\u03c0\n.\n2\n\n(29)\n\nUnder this constraint, the model predicts\n|U13 |2 =\n\n1 me\n= 0.00014 , or sin2 2\u03b813 = 0.00055 .\n2 m\u03c4 + me\n\n(30)\n\nHere we have used the running charged lepton mass at \u03bc = \u039bX [14]: me (\u039bX ) = 0.325 MeV,\nm\u03bc (\u039bX ) = 68.6 MeV, and m\u03bc (\u039bX ) = 1171.4 \u00b1 0.2 MeV. The value in Eq.(30) is consistent\nwith the present experimental constraints Eq.(24) and can be checked in neutrino factories\nin future [15] which have sensitivity for sin2 2\u03b813 as sin2 2\u03b813 \u2265 10\u22125 .\nFrom the mixing angle \u03b8sol in the present model, we obtain\nm1\n\u2243 tan2 \u03b8sol = 0.29 \u2212 0.64.\nm2\n6\n\n(31)\n\n\fThen, we obtain the neutrino masses\nm21 = (0.48 \u2212 6.8) \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2 ,\nm22 = (5.7 \u2212 16.6) \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2 ,\n\n(32)\n\nm23 = (1.4 \u2212 3.4) \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 .\nNext let us discuss the CP-violation phases in the lepton mixing matrix. The Majorana\nneutrino fields do not have the freedom of rephasing invariance, so that we can use only the\nrephasing freedom of Me to transform Eq.(16) to the standard form\nUstd = diag(ei\u03b11 , ei\u03b12 , ei\u03b12 ) U diag(e\u00b1i\u03c0/2 , 1, 1)\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\ni\u03b2\ni(\u03b3\u2212\u03b4\u03bd )\nc\u03bd13 c\u03bd12\nc\u03bd13 s\u03bd12 e\ns\u03bd13 e\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\ni\u03b4\u03bd\ni(\u03b3\u2212\u03b2) (33)\n= \uf8ec (\u2212c\u03bd23 s\u03bd12 \u2212 s\u03bd23 c\u03bd23 s\u03bd13 ei\u03b4\u03bd )e\u2212i\u03b2\n\uf8f7 .\nc\u03bd23 c\u03bd12 \u2212 s\u03bd23 s\u03bd12 s\u03bd13 e\ns\u03bd23 c\u03bd13 e\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n(s\u03bd23 s\u03bd12 \u2212 c\u03bd23 c\u03bd12 s\u03bd13 ei\u03b4\u03bd )e\u2212i\u03b3 (\u2212s\u03bd23 c\u03bd12 \u2212 c\u03bd23 s\u03bd12 s\u03bd13 ei\u03b4\u03bd )e\u2212i(\u03b3\u2212\u03b2)\nc\u03bd23 c\u03bd13\ne\n\ne\n\ne\n\nHere, \u03b1ie comes from the rephasing in the charged lepton fields to make the choice of phase\n\nconvention, and the specific phase \u03b6 \u2261 \u00b1\u03c0/2 is added on the right-hand side of U in order\nto change the neutrino eigenmass m1 to a positive quantity.

Note that the sign ambiguity in Ae and A\u03bd can be absorbed\ninto the phases \u03b4\u03bd2 and \u03b4\u03bd3 by the simultaneous redefinition of them. Hence, we can also\npredict the averaged neutrino mass hm\u03bd i which appears in the neutrinoless double beta\ndecay[17] as follows:\n2\n2\n2\nhm\u03bd i \u2261 \u2212m1 U11\n+ m2 U12\n+ m3 U13\nme i(\u03b4\u03bd3 +\u03b4\u03bd2 )\n2m1 m2\n\u2212 m3\ne\n\u2243\nm1 + m2\n2m\u03c4\n2m1 m2\n\u2243\n\u2243 0.0017 \u2212 0.0050 eV .\nm1 + m2\n\n7\n\n(35)\n\n\fLet us compare the result of the case (ii) with the case (i). In case (i), we have[5]\n|U13 |2 \u2243\n\nme\n\u03b4\u03bd3 \u2212 \u03b4\u03bd2\nsin2\n,\nm\u03bc\n2\n\n(36)\n\nwhile the result of tan2 \u03b8solar and sin2 2\u03b8atm are the same as Eqs. (21) and (22), respectively.\nConsequently, the values of \u03b8\u03bd and (\u03b4\u03bd3 \u2212 \u03b4\u03bd2 ) and the prediction for the neutrino masses\nof the model are also the same both for the cases (i) and (ii). However, an interesting\ndifference between the cases (i) and (ii) appears in the prediction for |U13 |2 . Namely the\nvalue of |U13 |2 in the case (ii) are much smaller than in the case (i) as seen in Eqs.(23) and\n(36). Therefore, the cases (i) and (ii) are distinguishable by the experimental determination\nof |U13 |2 in future, although they are both allowed from the present experimental data.\nIn conclusion, we have reanalyzed the lepton mixing matrix using the mass matrix model\nof Ref.[5] with the universal texture form. We have shown that the case (ii) with the type\nce and the type B for M\nc\u03bd can also lead to consistent values for the lepton\nA assignment for M\n\nmixing matrix. The neutrino masses, CP-violating phases, and the averaged neutrino mass\n\nhm\u03bd i in the case (ii) are predicted. It is also shown that the predicted value for |U13 | depends\non the assignment for the texture components of the mass matrices. Therefore, a proper\nassignment will be discriminated by future experimental data for |U13 |.\nThis work of K.M. was supported by the JSPS, No. 3700.\n\n[1] M.
