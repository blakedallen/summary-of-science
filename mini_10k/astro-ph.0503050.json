Therefore this nearest symbiotic-like system offers a\ntest-bed for detailed studies of wind accretion\nprocesses and accretion theory (Livio 1988).\nIn 1995, using the HST FOC, we resolved\nthe system for the first time spatially and\nspectrally at UV and optical wavelengths and\nstudied the interacting components individually (Karovska et al. 1997). In the past\nfew years we have been witnessing changes in\nthe spectral energy distribution (SED) of Mira\nAB, especially in UV (Karovska et al. 1997;\nWood, Karovska, &Hack 2001). In addition to\nthe general fading of the accretion luminosity,\nanother baffling development was the appearance of a forest of Ly\u03b1-fluoresced H2 emission\nlines, which dominated the HST spectra in\n1999, despite not being seen at all in the 1995\n\nIntroduction\n\nMira AB is an interacting binary system\ncomposed of an aging cool giant (Mira A) losing mass at a rate of \u223c10\u22127 Msol /yr (Bowers\n& Knapp, 1988), and an accreting companion (Mira B) about \u223c70 AU (\u223c0.6\") away.\nThis detached binary is one of very few wind\naccreting systems that has been spatially resolved and for which the energy distribution\nof both components can be determined unambiguously (Karovska et al., 1997).

Figure 1 shows the Chandra spectrum and the\nbest spectral fit (described in detail in \u00a73.2).\nThe source contained 5115 counts for a count\nrate of 0.073\u00b10.001 cts s\u22121 . The background\nrate was 0.0007 cts s\u22121 . In the 0.2-0.7 keV\nband, the count rate was 0.066\u00b10.001 cts s\u22121\n(background: 0.0003 cts s\u22121 ); in the 0.7-4\nkeV band, the detected rate was 0.008 cts s\u22121\n(background: 0.0004 cts s\u22121 ). The combination of the declining effective area below 0.5\nkeV plus the excess absorption layer (Chandra Proposer's Guide2 ) ensure minimal or zero\nphoton pile-up. Pushing all of the model parameters to their most pile-up-favorable extremes yields a pileup estimate of less than\n4%.\nWe detected several thousand counts below\n1 keV associated with a new bright soft source\nin the system, which was not reported a few\nmonths before by XMM (Kastner & Soker,\n2004b), or by ROSAT in 1993 (Karovska\net al., 1996). The high-energy component\n(>1keV) is similar in appearance to the quiescent XMM and ROSAT spectra. However,\na detailed comparison shows that a clear evolution has occurred in this portion of the spectrum (\u223c1.2-1.8 keV) as well. The count rates\n(see below), if folded through the XMM or\nROSAT effective areas, would have been easily detected in either instrument. Furthermore, the spectrum is dominated by the soft\ncomponent in the 0.2-0.7 keV band and the\nspectral behavior of the ROSAT and XMM\nspectra is significantly harder.\nFollowing the Chandra X-ray outburst detection, we requested and obtained Director's time on Chandra and HST. Chandra\nHRC/LETG observations (40 Ksec) were carried about two months after the initial Chan-\n\nspectra or by IUE (Wood, Karovska, & Hack\n2001; Wood, Karovska, & Raymond, 2002).\nA similar drop in the accretion luminosity and\nappearance of a set of Ly\u03b1-fluoresced H2 emission lines were also seen in the FUSE spectra\nin 2001 (Wood & Karovska 2004). Variable\nmass loss from Mira A could have caused the\nchanges in the UV flux of Mira B observed in\nthe past 10 years signaling that the system is\nundergoing dramatic changes.\nIn 1993, the ROSAT observation of Mira\nAB resulted in the first unambiguous detection of X-ray emission from Mira AB\n(Karovska at al. 1996). This observation\nresolved the contradicting results from the\nanalysis of the EINSTEIN observation; Jura\n& Helfand (1984) marginally detected an Xray source, while Maggio et al. (1990) set an\nupper limit of f x <1.4 \u00d710\u221213 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 .\nThe ROSAT X-ray luminosity of the Mira AB\nsystem was estimated \u223c1029 erg s\u22121 (Karovska\net al. 1996) which is similar to the luminosity\nestimated from the XMM observations carried out about ten years later (Kastner &\nSoker 2004b).\nIn this Letter we report the initial results\nfrom our recent Chandra observations and\nfrom coordinated HST and ground-based observations of Mira AB, including our discovery\nof a soft X-ray outburst in Mira A.\n2.\n\nObservations and Analysis\n\nOn 2003 December 6 we carried out a 70\nKsec pointed Chandra observation of Mira AB\nusing the ACIS-S instrument (Weisskopf et al.\n2002). The source was placed at the nominal\naim point of ACIS-S, on CCD S3. We analyzed the Chandra observations using CIAO\ndata reduction and analysis routines. 1 The\nsource spectrum was extracted using an aper1\n\nCIAO is the Chandra Interactive Analysis of\nObservation's data analyses system package\n(http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao)\n\n2\n\n2\n\nhttp://asc.harvard.edu/proposer/POG/index.html\n\n\fdra observations (on January 11 2004). We\ndetected signal only in the zeroth order of the\nspectrum which showed that the brightness\nof the soft source had dropped significantly.\nThis observation detected \u223c80 counts. Were\nthe soft ACIS spectral component (\u00a73.2) still\npresent with the same absorbed flux at the\ntime of the LETG observation, >250 counts\nwould have been detected in the zero-order\nimage. However, the detected counts could\nbe due to the hard source as well, or to both\nsources. Further modeling using the HRC and\nthe ACIS observations is in progress.\nWe carried out follow-up HST STIS CCD\nand MAMA observations about two months\nafter the initial Chandra observations (2004\nFebruary 2 and February 16). We resolved\nthe system in the near-UV and obtained individual spectra of both components. MultiDrizzle techniques (Koekemoer at al. 2002)\nwere used to combine multiple CCD images\nrecorded using the F28x50OII filter centered\non the [OII] 3729 \u00c5 line. The images resolved\nthe system and detected extended emission.\nThe STIS spectra show a significant increase\nin the Mg h & k lines emission in Mira A\nand in Mira B when compared to the 1999\nSTIS observations. Velocity shifts of the order of 100 km/s were also detected in Mira\nA's Mg h & k lines. A similar increase of line\nemission was detected in the optical spectra\n(H\u03b1 and OIII\u03bb5007\u00c5 lines) obtained at the\nOak Ridge observatory. In addition, broadening and complex structure were observed\nin the H\u03b1 during the month following the Xray outburst, indicating velocities of \u223c 100\nkm/s. Further details of the analysis and\nthe results of the Chandra, HST, and groundbased observations will be discussed elsewhere\n(Karovska et al., 2005, in prep.).\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nResults\nX-ray and near-UV Imaging\n\nThe ACIS-S raw image of Mira AB binned\nat the detector 0.495\" pixel resolution showed\nan elongation along the Mira AB system axis\n(Figure 2a). We made soft (< 0.7 keV) and\nhard (0.7-2 keV) images of Mira AB, filtered\nbased on the major components detected in\nthe ACIS-S spectrum. Figure 2b shows the\nimage of the hard source (to the East) with an\noverlay of the contours of the soft component\n(to the West). The centroids of these sources\nare displaced by \u223c 0.6\".\nWe attempted to do further spatial analysis\nusing the HRC zeroth order image. The image\nappears extended and it is shifted \u223c0.3 arcseconds from the soft ACIS image, in the direction toward the hard ACIS image. It could\ntherefore be associated with Mira A or Mira\nB (or both). However, the low counts and\nlack of spectral resolution make it difficult to\ndetermine if there is a component associated\nwith a remnant of the outburst. Although\nthe HRC pixels (\u223c0.14\") are indeed smaller\nthan the ACIS pixels, the actual resolution of\nthe HRC is in fact comparable to ACIS. Furthermore, there are additional artifacts in the\nHRC images that makes it very difficult deciding if the extension in the image to the South\nand an additional source 0.5\" to the West are\nreal.\nWe explored the spatial extent of the emission in the ACIS-S (0.3-4 keV) image of the\nsystem at 0.2\" resolution using a new multiscale deconvolution technique EMC2 (Esch\net al. 2004) and Chandra PSF model. This\nwas possible because the Chandra data include information about the photon energies\nand positions which was used to obtain filtered images and carry out sub-pixel resolution analysis. The Chandra PSF varies as a\nfunction of energy and off-axis angle; we carried out PSF simulations using CIAO software\n3\n\n\fThe X-ray images of Mira A and Mira B appear extended. Furthermore, the Chandra image shows a faint \"bridge-like\" feature extending between the components. Similar \"bridgelike\" structure was detected in the 1995 HST\nimages indicating possible mass flow between\nthe components (Karovska et al. 1997). Although the features in the X-ray image are uncertain because of the low count level and/or\npossible PSF and deconvolution artifacts, we\nnote that very similar structures can be seen\nin the overlayed HST contours.\nWe determined that some of the extended\nstructure in the HST image to the right of\nMira A, in the opposite direction from Mira\nB, is due to an undocumented red leak of the\nF28x50OII filter. Following the HST observations we discovered and confirmed the red\nleak in other very red sources. For example,\nF28x50OII filter images of CH Cyg, which\ncontain a very red component, show similar\nstructure, and we have detected similar structured PSF in the [OIII]5007 filter during the\n1999 observation of Mira AB.\nThe evidence of extended structures in\nboth components in both X-ray and UV images is uncertain and require further analysis\nand modeling. In order to determine if there\nwas a mass ejection during the outburst, it\nwill be necessary to carry out further highangular resolution monitoring including at Xray and UV wavelengths.\n\nand threads, including the ChaRT PSF simulator3 . The PSF simulation was carried out\nusing information on the spectral distribution\nand off-axis location of the system as inputs to\nChaRT. The EMC2 deconvolution technique,\ndescribed in detail in Esch et al. 2004, was\ndeveloped for low-count statistics data, and\nit provides error estimates in addition to the\nreconstructed images.\nThe deconvolved image (color image in Figure 3) shows two sources separated by \u223c0.6\".\nThe pixel size is 0.1\" (0.2 ACIS-S pixel size).\nThis is the first image of an interacting binary that has been spatially resolved at Xray wavelengths. We note that the location\nof the brighter source in the deconvolved image (to the West) corresponds to the position\nof the soft source (as determined using filtered\nACIS-S images), and the fainter source (to the\nEast) corresponds to the hard-band ACIS-S\nimage.\nWe compared the X-ray images with the\nHST images of the Mira AB components obtained two months later, showing two sources\nseparated by \u223c0.6\". In the HST images Mira\nA is to the west of Mira B. Figure 3 displays\nthe overlay of the contours of the HST 3729\n\u00c5 image on the Chandra deconvolved image,\nshowing that the soft X-ray source is in the\nvicinity of the of Mira A. The soft source\nis therefore likely associated with the AGB\nstar rather than with the accreting companion\nMira B. When the X-ray image is compared to\nthe HST image of Mira A and Mira B, we see\nslightly larger separation of the X-ray components (\u223c0.1\") and possible small rotation of\nthe axis between the sources. This difference\ncould be real, but also it could be due to uncertainties in the deconvolution, or to the limited resolution in the Chandra data. It could\nalso be a result of HST absolute positioning\nuncertainties.\n3\n\n3.2.\n\nX-ray Spectroscopy\n\nThe spectrum was binned to a minimum of\n20 counts per channel. The effective area was\ncorrected for the energy- and time-dependent\ninstrumental absorption and Xspec v11.0 was\nused to fit the spectra (Arnaud 1996) as detailed below. The X-ray spectrum shows\nstrong soft emission and potentially multiple harder components. Standard continuum\nmodels (bremsstrahlung, blackbody, power\nlaw) did not provide good fits to the soft com-\n\nhttp://asc.harvard.edu/chart/index.html)\n\n4\n\n\ftions of expected line emission. The fitted\nbremsstrahlung temperature is nearly identical with the value determined from the XMM\nspectrum (Kastner & Soker 2004b). The fitted column is about a factor of two higher\nthan the XMM-determined value. A specific\nerror range is not shown for the XMM value,\nbut the authors state \"formal uncertainties\nare \u224820%\". A 20% error range on the XMM\nvalue places it outside the 90% range of the\nfitted value determined here suggesting the\ncolumn may have increased by a factor of\n\u22482 between the two observations. The hard\ngaussians have equivalent widths of 236+244\n\u2212110\nand 124+124\neV,\nrespectively,\nand\nwe\nattribute\n\u221250\nthem to Ne and Mg emission lines. We note,\nNe IX and Ne X lines were also detected by\nthe XMM (Kastner & Soker 2004), but the\nMg line is not pronounced in the XMM spectrum. These results are similar to the enhanced K\u03b1 H-like Ne and He-like Mg lines\nobserved in the ASCA spectrum of the symbiotic CH Cyg showing jet activity (Ezuka et\nal. 2001), corresponding to log(T)=6.8. Our\nsignal-to-noise is insufficient to fit for the Helike Si line (found in the CH Cyg spectrum).\nThese high temperature lines may indicate\nshock heated emission or could be associated\nwith the flare or a jet-like ejecta.\nWe calculated the total flux from the\nsystem 5.6\u00d710\u221213 (0.2-4 keV), 5.5\u00d710\u221213\n(soft component only in 0.2-0.7 keV), and\n2.7\u00d710\u221214 (hard component only in 0.7-4\nkeV) erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 for the bands defined.\nThe unabsorbed fluxes are very sensitive to\nthe adopted column. The fitted column toward the soft source is \u223c8.0\u00d71019 cm\u22122 . This\nvalue, if adopted as the column toward the\nsystem, is not consistent with the column obtained from the ROSAT spectrum (Karovska\net al. 1996) nor the XMM observation (Kastner & Soker 2004b). However, the fitted column is really only a lower limit. The 90%\n4\nAvailable at http://space.mit.edu/ASC/calib/letg acis/ck cal.html.\nconfidence contour is closer to \u223c2.8\u00d71020\nponent. We describe the spectral fit below\nwith 90% errors on the model parameters.\nWe fit the low-energy portion of the spectrum using an absorbed model spectrum consisting of a sum of gaussians, each with a\nfixed center and zero width to represent an\nun-resolved line. We included several C, N,\nand O lines. The line centers (in keV) are at\nC V 0.299, 0.304, 0.308; C VI 0.367; N VI\n0.319, 0.426, 0.431; C VI 0.435, 0.459; N VII\n0.500; O VII 0.561, 0.569, 0.574; and O VIII\n0.653). For each line, only the normalization\nwas fit. The initial fit showed that the O line\nnormalizations were all consistent with zero\nas were approximately half of the C and N\nnormalizations; a subsequent fit used a model\ncontaining only the C and N lines. Figure\n1 shows the result with lines at C VI 0.367\nkeV, N VI 0.426 keV, C VI 0.459 keV, and\nN VII 0.500 keV (line normalizations = 4.9,\n6.2, 50.8, and 33.1, respectively, in units of\n10\u22125 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 ). Because of the limited spectral resolution we cannot determine\nif there are any specific lines detected, or if\nthe fit is unique. When we added a continuum component, its model normalization was\nconsistent with zero. The apparently large\nresiduals near 0.3 keV may be explained by\nthe known problems with the corrections for\nthe contaminant near the carbon edge (Marshall 20034 ). The best-fit spectrum is therefore most easily explained as blended emission\nof C + N lines.\nThe hard component was best-fit with a\nbremsstrahlung continuum of kT \u223c0.78+0.15\n\u22120.23\nkeV to mimic an optically thin thermal\nplasma, plus two zero-width gaussians representing emission lines at 1.02+0.06\n\u22120.04 and\n1.36+0.03\nkeV,\nall\nabsorbed\nby\na column\n\u22120.04\n+0.15\n22\n\u22122\nNH \u223c9.0\u22120.12 \u00d710 cm . Other models\nprovided very poor fits including models\ncontaining additional gaussians at the posi-\n\n5\n\n\fcm\u22122 . Within this upper limit, the column\nremains inconsistent with the XMM value,\nbut is consistent with the column determined\nfrom the UV H2 line spectroscopy (Wood et\nal. 2002). If we adopt the formal-fit column from the soft spectrum, then the unabsorbed fluxes are 6.4\u00d710\u221213 (0.2-4 keV),\n6.2\u00d710\u221213 (0.2-0.7 keV), and 2.7\u00d710\u221214 (0.74 keV) erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 . If we adopt the upper\nlimit value for the column, the unabsorbed\nfluxes are 8.3\u00d710\u221213 (0.2-4 keV), 8.0\u00d710\u221213\n(0.2-0.7 keV), and 2.7\u00d710\u221214 (0.7-4 keV) erg\ns\u22121 cm\u22122 . Adopting the fitted value of the\ncolumn for the hard component, the unabsorbed hard band flux is 9.9\u00d710\u221214 erg s\u22122\ncm\u22122 (0.7-4 keV).\nWe emphasize that the appropriate NH\nvalue could be completely different for the\nhard and soft sources since the emissions originate from different places. It is conceivable\nthat a persistent low energy X-ray source exists, and that it was made visible by a temporary drop in the neutral column density surrounding Mira A. It seems more likely, however, that an X-ray flare ionized its surroundings, producing the formal value of smaller\ncolumn as a side effect. Taking note of the\ndifferent columns toward the sources, the unabsorbed luminosity then falls into the range\nof 1.5-2\u00d71030 erg s\u22121 , for an assumed distance\nof 130 pc, and assuming the luminosity is the\nsum of the soft and hard components separately. The range results from the adopted\nvalue of the column toward the soft component. The total luminosity is about a factor\nof 2-4 higher than that observed by XMM and\nROSAT. A detailed analysis and modeling of\nthe Chandra data combined with the multiwavelength observations of the outburst will\nbe discussed elsewhere (Karovska et al., 2005,\nin prep.).\n\n4.\n\nPossible Causes and Consequences\nof the X-ray Outburst\n\nDetecting X-ray emission from Mira A is a\nvery important result because X-ray emission\nhas not been detected so far in single AGB\nstars, including Miras (e.g. Kastner & Soker\n2004a). The soft X-ray outburst in Mira A\ncould be caused by a magnetic flare followed\nby a large mass ejection, analogous to the solar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections(CMEs).\nSoker and Kastner (2003) suggested that magnetic reconnection events near the stellar surface should lead to localized, long-duration\nflares. The crude time scale for a flare might\nbe estimated by multiplying the 1-2 day time\nscale for a large flare on an RS CVn star by\nthe ratio of Mira A's radius (few hundred solar\nradii) to that of the RS CVn star (4-15 solar\nradii), suggesting time scales from weeks to\nmonths, which is in accordance with the time\nscale of the X-ray event observed by Chandra.\nIn the case of mass ejection we could expect changes in the SED of both components\non a time scale of months to years. As the\nejected material cools down we expect a significant increase in dust formation in the system in 2004/2005. This is also the time scale\non which we would expect a response of the\naccretion disk around Mira B to any disturbance caused by an outburst on Mira A in\nlate 2003, if the flow is propagating toward\nMira B with speed of \u223c hundred km/s (as\nsuggested by our preliminary analysis of the\nHST and ground-based spectroscopy). An increased outflow from Mira A resulting from\nthe recent outburst could help renew the accretion disk around the companion, following\nthe low-state observed by HST and FUSE in\n1999\u20132001.\nThe increased accretion rate into Mira B\ncould also cause instabilities in the accretion\ndisk and jet-like activity (e.g. Soker 2002)\nsimilar to that detected in several nearby\n\n6\n\n\funresolved symbiotic systems (e.g. in CH\nCyg, Corradi et al. 2001, R Aqr, Kellogg\net al. 2001). An outburst in Mira B associated with the accretion disk instabilities\ncould be analogous to a dwarf nova outburst\nexcept that the much larger size of the windfed disk in this well-separated binary would\nincrease the duration from about a week to\nmany months. Further multiwavelength observations are necessary to determine the nature and characteristics of instabilities in the\nsystem and/or its individual components that\nmay have caused the outburst, and to understand the long-term consequences of this outburst on the system.\n\nEsch, D.N., Connors, A., Karovska, M., & van\nDyk, D.A., 2004, ApJ, 610, 1213.\n\nWe are grateful to Drs H.
