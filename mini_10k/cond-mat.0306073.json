This process depends on several important parameters including the lattice mismatch and the\ninteraction between the different atoms including magnetic contributions. In particular the explanation of any\nordering of A- and B-atoms close to the interface would\nrequire a detailed investigation of these interactions [12].\nThe situation becomes considerably simpler, however,\nif one is interested in the physical properties further away\nfrom the interface. Then the concentration of A-atoms\nmay be regarded as sufficiently low that their interaction\nas well as A-B-ordering become unimportant. The focus\non this region justifies our simplified model, in which\nthe interdiffusion zone depends only on the deposition\nrate F of B-atoms, the diffusion constants DA and DB\nof the adatoms of type Aor B, respectively, and the rate\nE for the exchange of B-adatoms with A-atoms. The\nlimit E/DB \u2192 \u221e, where a B-adatom exchanges with\nthe first A-atom it encounters, would be realized, if the\nB-adatoms diffuse by an exchange mechanism [13], while\nthe A-adatoms diffuse by hopping. In the present paper\nwe simplify the model even further by assuming that both\nkinds of atoms diffuse equally fast on the surface, DA =\nDB = D, with a diffusion constant independent of the\nsurface composition.\nApart from the exchange there is a second crucial ingredient in the model: The A-atoms behave only partially\nas a surfactant in the sense that they can be overgrown\nby island edges. By contrast a perfect surfactant atom\nshould \"float up\" also in front of an advancing island\nedge.\nNaively one would expect an exponential decay of the\ndensity profile of A-atoms far from the interface. It is\nthe main result of this investigation that this is not always the case: The incorporation of A-atoms is much\nslower, giving rise to a power law decay of the concentration profile in the limit of perfect layer-by-layer growth,\nD/F \u2192 \u221e. In this case the width of the interdiffusion\nzone diverges, provided there are no finite size effects. By\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nHeterolayers, where e.g. ferromagnets are in contact\nwith antiferromagnets, semiconductors or superconductors, give rise to new ordering and transport phenomena, which depend crucially on the interfacial structure. Examples for such ordering phenomena are the\nexchange bias [1], or the cryptomagnetism [2]. Electronic transport through a ferromagnetic-nonmagneticferromagnetic sandwich (\"spin valve\" geometry) gives\nrise to the giant magneto-resistance [3,4]. Another\nexample is the recently predicted possibility to enhance or reduce a Josephson current magnetically by replacing the tunnel barrier of a Josephson junction by\na ferromagnetic-insulating-ferromagnetic sandwich [5].\nThese phenomena belong to the growing field of spintronics [6], where the spin degree of freedom is used for\nelectronic signal processing. Interfacial mixing affects all\nof them [7]. For example, it leads to spin scattering disturbing the spin dependent transport properties.\nTherefore it is important to be able to control the various physical processes that may spoil well defined interfaces. Some of them proceed after growth such as bulk\ninterdiffusion or chemical interface reactions like silicide\nformation. However, there are also important processes\ntaking place exclusively at the surface: For example the\nsubstrate may partially behave like a surfactant, when\none grows a different material on it. It is this latter mechanism which we investigate in this paper. The questions\nwe want to answer concern the asymptotic concentration\nprofile, the width of the interdiffusion zone and possible\ncorrelations among the substrate impurities within the\ngrowing layer.\nSpecifically we consider growing some material B on\na substrate A. Obviously the interfacial mixing requires\nthat some substrate (A-) atoms get replaced by B-atoms\nand \"float up\" on the surface until they get incorporated\ninto the growing film. There is ample experimental evidence that such a behaviour occurs in very different sys1\n\n\f(7) When an adatom, regardless of its type, reaches a site\nadjacent to an island, it is irreversibly bound, increasing\nthe size of the island.\n(8) Both types of particles can diffuse down across terrace\nedges without being hindered by an Ehrlich-Schwoebel\nbarrier.\n(9) There are no overhangs, i.e., we assume SOS growth.\n(10) The exchange of a B-atom with an A-atom underneath is forbidden, if the B-atom is already part of an island, i.e., if it has a nearest neighbor at the same height.\nHence A-atoms can be overgrown by island edges.\n\ncontrast, we shall show that for finite D/F the width of\nthe interdiffusion zone is no longer infinite, but a power\nlaw of D/F .\nThis paper is organized as follows. In the next section we are going to define a simple solid-on-solid (SOS)\nmodel for epitaxial growth of a B-layer on an A-substrate,\nwhich allows for the irreversible exchange of B-atoms\nwith A's at the surface. In this model the A-atoms on\nthe surface turn out to cluster in a time-periodic selforganized way, which is explained in Sec.III. The next\nthree sections, Sec.IV \u2013 VI, are devoted to the limit\nD/F \u2192 \u221e. First, in Sec.IV, we present a simple mean\nfield argument leading to the prediction, that the concentration of A's decays algebraically in the B-layer. For a finite system size this power-law is cut off leading to a finite\nwidth H of the interdiffusion zone, which is discussed in\nSec.V, where also a scaling ansatz for the surface concentration cA is proposed. This scaling ansatz is confirmed\nby simulation results for one- and two-dimensional surfaces in Sec.VI. The remaining sections deal with interdiffusion for finite D/F . Sec.VII contains simulation results and scaling arguments, and in Sec.VIII a rate equation theory is developed for the interdiffusion problem.\nIn the Appendix we describe a very efficient implementation of the simulation model for one-dimensional surfaces\nin the limit D/F \u2192 \u221e.\n\nMeasuring time in units of monolayers (ML) and\nlengths in units of the lattice constant a, this model is\ncontrolled by the two dimensionless parameters D/F a4\nand rE \u2261 a2 E/D. (In the following we set a = 1.)\n\nFIG. 1. The growth process of the model. Batoms are deposited with a deposition rate F onto the substrate. Adatoms diffuse on the surface and down to the binding site at an island edge\nwith diffusion constant D irrespective of their type. In the top\nlayer mobile B's can exchange with A's with an effective exchange\nrate E.\n\nII. THE MODEL\n\nIn order to model heteroepitaxial growth of a B-layer\non an A-substrate including the interfacial mixing, we\nintroduce a simple solid-on-solid (SOS) model, where\nthe lattice mismatch and most interactions between the\natoms are neglected. Moreover we describe the exchange\nmechanism of B-adatoms with A-atoms in the surface\nsimply by a phenomenological constant exchange rate E,\nalthough it depends in reality on the system parameters\nas well as the local environment.\nThe model is defined on a simple cubic lattice by the\nfollowing kinetic rules (cf. Fig. 1):\n(1) Starting from an initially flat substrate consisting of\nA-atoms, B-atoms are deposited at randomly selected\nsites on the surface with deposition rate F .\n(2) As long as they do not have a lateral neighbor, the\nB-atoms diffuse on the surface with diffusion constant D.\n(3) When such a B-atoms happens to sit on top of a Aatom, it can exchange vertically with rate E or continue\nto diffuse with rate D.\n(4) After an exchange, the B-atom stays irreversibly\nbound, whereas the A-atom diffuses on the surface with\ndiffusion constant D.\n(5) There is no back exchange, when a A-atom sits on\ntop of a B-atom.\n(6) When two adatoms, regardless of their type, meet,\nthey form a stable non-moving nucleation center of an\nisland.\n\nThis model will be investigated for one- and twodimensional (d = 1 and d = 2) surfaces in the following. Note that it reduces to the usual model for\nMBE growth (for a recent review see e.g. [14]), if one\ndoes not distinguish the two particle types. Therefore,\nthe D/F -dependence of quantities like island density,\nadatom density, surface width, etc. are the same as\nusual. For general values of D/F and E/D we use kinetic\nMonte Carlo simulations [15,16] in order to investigate\nthe model. However, for one-dimensional surfaces in the\nlimit D/F \u2192 \u221e we implemented a much more efficient\nalgorithm, which is described in the Appendix.\nIII. CORRELATIONS OF THE A-ATOMS\n\nOne of the most intriguing qualitative properties of this\nmodel is the time-periodic self organization of A-clusters\non the growing surface with a period of one monolayer.\nFig.2 shows that the A-atoms (black) are first clustered\naround the nucleation sites of a new layer, but migrate\ntowards the holes remaining in that layer, when the islands coalesce. Thus the characteristic distance between\nthese clusters agrees with the typical distance between\n2\n\n\fthe nucleation sites, the diffusion length\nlD \u223c (D/F )\u03b3 ,\n\n(1)\n\nas long as layer-by-layer growth persits. This can be\nverified by examining the lateral correlations of A-atoms\non the surface after deposition of t monolayers:\nd\n\nL\n1 X\ng(~r, t) = d\n\u03c1A (~x, t) \u03c1A (~x + ~r, t) \u2212 cA (t)2 ,\nL x=1\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c1A (~x) denotes, whether there is an A-atom at the\nsurface at site ~x [\u03c1A (~x) = 1] or not [\u03c1A (~x) = 0], and\ncA (t) denotes the surface density of A-atoms. d is the\ndimension of the surface. In our simulations, d was 1 or 2.\nA data collapse of these correlation functions for different\nvalues of D/F is obtained, if the space coordinates are\nrescaled by lD (see Fig. 3 for d = 1), which shows that\nthis is the characteristic distance between the A-clusters.\nThe mechanism of the periodic self organization can\nmost clearly be seen in the limit rE = E/D \u2192 \u221e, where\nevery B-adatom exchanges with the first exchange partner A it encounters. When layer t is completed and layer\nt+1 begins to grow, the first B-atoms deposited are likely\nto exchange with A-atoms from layer t. Hence the nuclei\nof islands in the new layer t+1 will consist predominantly\nof A-atoms. As growth proceeds, the lower terrace (layer\nt) gets depleted from exchange partners A, either because\nthey are exchanged with freshly deposited B-adatoms or\nget overgrown by the islands. Then the core of the islands\nwith a high concentration of A-atoms gets surrounded by\nmainly B-atoms (Fig. 2, left). However, as the island\nsize increases, it becomes more and more likely that Batoms are deposited on top of the islands, i.e. in layer\nt + 2. These B-adatoms find many exchange partners\nat the core of the islands, which then become \"washed\nout\" and start decorating the island edges, because there\nare no Ehrlich-Schwoebel barriers in our model. Note\nthat this edge decoration with A-atoms happens without lateral exchange of B- with A-atoms at the edges of\nthe islands, in contrast to the situation studied in [17].\nAs a result, the interior of the islands gets cleared from\nA-atoms, which are collected in the holes of layer t + 1\nwhich get filled last (Fig. 2, right). Then the process\nstarts again: Layer t + 2 nucleates predominantly with\nA-atoms which were exchanged from layer t + 1.\nFor finite rE the mechanism is similar. However, for\nvicinal surfaces growing in step flow mode, the correlations among the A-atoms are different. Here, the terraces\nget cleared of A-atoms, which attach to the step edges.\nThis decoration of advancing edges leads to a correlation\npattern g(~r, t) with a spatial periodicity identical to the\nwidth of the terraces.\n\nFIG. 2.\nTop view on the surface structure at t = 3.3\nML (left) and t = 4.0 ML (right).\nA-atoms are black,\nB atoms are height-encoded, where brighter means higher.\nD/F = 107 , E/D = 103 , L2 = 100 \u00d7 100.\n\n0.12\n7\n\nD/F = 10\n8\nD/F = 10\n9\nD/F = 10\n10\nD/F = 10\n\n0.1\n\ng(r, 1)\n\n0.08\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n0\n-0.02\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nr / (D/F)\n\n3\n\n4\n\n\u03b3\n\nFIG. 3.

The average distance between\nA-clusters scales with D/F like the distance of the nucleation sites,\nlD .\n\nisland on the surface, nucleating at a random site. Afterwards at most one adatom can be found on the surface\nat a time. If we assume maximal exchange in addition,\ni.e. an exchange rate E much larger than both D and\nF , rE = E/D \u2192 \u221e, the model becomes parameter-free.\nA-atoms can be buried even in this limit, when they are\novergrown by an island edge. However, the last A-atom\nwill never get buried in this case. The nucleus of a new\nlayer will always contain at least one of the remaining\nsurface atoms of type Ain the limit we focus on, because\nthe first B-atom deposited after completion of a layer\nexchanges with an A-atom before the next B-atom gets\ndeposited: cA (t \u2192 \u221e) = L\u2212d . As this case is scale free,\nwe expect that the concentration of A-atoms falls off like\na power law into the growing B-film.\nIn order to get a first idea about the distribution of\nA-atoms in the growing B-film, it suffices to consider the\nconcentration cA (n) of A-atoms at the surface after the\n\nIV. THE SCALE FREE LIMIT\n\nThe limit of perfect layer-by-layer growth, D/F \u2192 \u221e,\nis particularly instructive. In this case, there is only one\n3\n\n\fdeposition of n monolayers. During the growth of the\nnext layer, a certain fraction (1 \u2212 q) \u2208 [0, 1) of these\nA-atoms is transported to the next layer via vertical exchange:\ncA (n + 1) = (1 \u2212 q)cA (n).\n\nThe argument leading to Eq.(5) ignores that the Aatoms at the surface are clustered, as shown in Fig.2,\nand was made plausible only for a one-dimensional surface. However, it can be refined such that it takes these\nspacial correlations into account and applies also for twodimensional surfaces. For D/F \u2192 \u221e, we can imagine\nthat there is only one cluster of size cA (n)Ld on the surface, when the new layer nucleates. The important point\nis that the nucleation happens anywhere on the surface\nwith equal probability 1/Ld in this case. However, only\nif the nucleation site is within an area of about the size\n2d cA (n)Ld centered at the middle of the cluster, there\nis a chance that some A-atoms get overgrown. In other\nwords, only a fraction of nucleation sites \u221d cA (n) leads to\novergrowth. The average number of A-atoms overgrown\nin such a case is proportional to the cluster size. Hence\non average a fraction q of A-atoms is overgrown which is\nproportional to the fraction of nucleation sites leading to\novergrowth, i.e. this refined argument gives q \u221d cA (n) as\nin Eq.(5).\n\n(3)\n\nIf q was constant, this would imply an exponential decay cA (n) \u221d (1 \u2212 q)n . In the present model, however,\nthe probability q that an A-atom gets overgrown decreases with decreasing cA (n), resulting in a decay which\nis slower than exponential.\nQualitatively this can be understood in the following\nway: In the limit D/F \u2192 \u221e there is only one island on\nthe surface. Moreover, any A-atom on the lower terrace\ngets transferred to the new layer as soon as it is reached\nby an adatom of type B, because rE \u2192 \u221e is assumed, as\nwell. Only A-atoms sufficiently close to the island have a\nchance to be overgrown by the island edge before being\nvisited by a B-atom.\nThe island edge advances a characteristic distance\nlcover , while the lower terrace gets depleted from Aatoms by exchange with adatoms of type B. For a onedimensional surface of length L it is clear that lcover is\nproportional to the number of A-atoms at the surface,\ncA (n)L. Hence, the number of A-atoms with a chance to\nbe overgrown is of the order of\nlcover cA (n) \u221d cA (n)2 L.\n\nV. THE WIDTH OF THE INTERDIFFUSION\nZONE FOR D/F \u2192 \u221e\n\nIn the previous section we predicted that the width\nof the interdiffusion zone diverges in the scale free limit,\nwhere D/F \u2192 \u221e and rE \u2192 \u221e. In this section we predict, that for finite rE the power law Eq.(7) is only valid,\nif the system is infinitely large. For finite system size\nthe power law is exponentially cut off at a characteristic\nwidth of the interdiffusion zone.\nAfter the completion of several monolayers on a substrate of linear size L the number of substrate atoms at\nthe surface is cA Ld . The A-atoms are concentrated in\na cluster, which we assume to be compact, hence of di1/d\nameter \u221d cA L. This assumption is justified even for\nd = 2, where the islands initially are fractal, because the\nA-cluster occupies the sites which were filled last in the\nuppermost monolayer. These sites do not form a fractal.\nNow we imagine the surface to be coarse grained on\nthe scale of the cluster diameter so that exactly one cell\ncontains the A-cluster. The typical residence time of an\nadatom in such a cell is\n\n(4)\n\nThis must be compared with qcA (n)L, which shows that\nq \u221d cA (n).\n\n(5)\n\nInserting Eq.(5) into Eq.(3) leads to the difference\nequation\ncA (n + 1) \u2212 cA (n) \u221d \u2212cA (n)2\n\n(6)\n\nimplying the asymptotic power law\ncA (n) \u223c 1/n\n\n(7)\n\nfor the concentration of A-atoms at the surface.\nThe concentration profile of A-atoms inside the grown\nfilm is given by\n\u03c1(n) = cA (n) \u2212 cA (n + 1) \u223c 1/n2 .\n\n1/d\n\n(8)\n\n\u2206t =\n\nIt is remarkable that for the mechanism discussed in this\npaper the width of the interdiffusion zone diverges logarithmically with the thickness T of the film:\nT\n\u22121\nX\nn=1\n\n\u03c1(n)n + cA (T )T \u223c ln T.\n\n(cA L)2\n.\nD\n\n(10)\n\nA B-adatom which enters the cell containing the Acluster will almost certainly be replaced by an exchange\npartner A within the residence time, if\n1/d\n\nE\u2206t = rE (cA L)2 \u226b 1\n\n(9)\n\n(11)\n\n(exchange dominates). For E\u2206t \u226a 1 the adatom changes\nfrom type B into type A only with probability E\u2206t (overgrowth dominates).\nIt is plausible to assume that the power law belongs\nto the exchange dominated slow decay of cA while the\n\nNevertheless, the interface can be localized precisely, because B-atoms do not occur below layer n = 0 due to the\nabsence of bulk diffusion in this model. Below we show\nthat these power laws are confirmed by simulations.\n4\n\n\fand varied the values of rE and system size L for one- and\ntwo-dimensional surfaces. For the case d = 1 we used\nthe algorithm described in the appendix, while kinetic\nMonte-Carlo simulations were done for d = 2.\nFig. 4 (for d = 1) and Figures 5, 6 (for d = 2) show the\nconcentration cA of A-atoms at the surface as a funcion of\ndeposition time t (in monolayers of B-atoms). All curves\nare averages over 200 - 400 independent runs. Both for\nd = 1 and d = 2 the exponent of the power law decay\nwas found to be consistent with the value -1 derived in\nsection IV.\nAs shown in Fig. 4, the predicted relations Eq.(12)\nand Eq.(13) lead to the expected data collapse for the\none dimensional surface. The results in two dimensions\nare not as clear. In this case, we obtain the best data\ncollapse with\n\nexponential cut off indicates the much faster decay when\novergrowth dominates. Thus the width H of the interdiffusion zone should be reached, when cA becomes so\nsmall that exchange is no longer guaranteed, i.e. when\nE\u2206t drops below 1. Inserting cA \u2248 1/t = 1/H into\nEq.(11) one obtains\n\u221a\n(12)\nH \u2248 ( rE L)d .\nHowever, as cA cannot become smaller than L\u2212d , this estimate is only valid for rE < 1, while H \u2248 Ld for rE > 1.\nThis is our prediction for the width of the interdiffusion\nzone in the limit D/F \u2192 \u221e. Note that in this limit the\ncutoff of the power law is a finite size effect: For L \u2192 \u221e\nthe power law extends to infinity.\nBased on the results of this and the previous paragraph we can conjecture the following scaling form for\nthe surface concentration of A's :\n\u0012 \u0013\n1\nt\ncA (t, L; rE ) \u2212 cA (t \u2192 \u221e) = f\n(13)\nH\nH\n\n1.2\nH \u221d L1.93 * rE\n,\n\nas shown in the Figures 5 and 6, whereas our predicted\nexponents (2 and 1, respectively, see Eq.(12)) were about\n4% and 20% different.

SCALING FOR FINITE D/F\n\nFor finite D/F there are many A-clusters on the surface. Their typical distance is given by the diffusion\nlength lD as shown in Sec.III. The average size of the Aclusters is cA ldD , provided this is much larger than 1. If\nthe concentration cA becomes too small, less and less Aclusters will be found on the surface, and their typical distance will grow. Finally all A-atoms will be overgrown, in\ncontrast to the situation of perfect layer-by-layer growth,\nwhere the last A-atom could never be overgrown. Apart\n\nVI.

Qualitatively, the surface concentration cA indeed decays first approximately as a power law\nof the deposition time, which is cut off at a characteristic\nwidth H of the interdiffusion zone.\nQuantitatively, however, the situation turns out to be\nmore complex than this: All exponents are different, as\nthe simulation results (Figs. 7 \u2013 10) show. The power\nlaw decay of cA \u221d t\u2212\u03b2 extends over at most two decades\nfor the largest values of D/F we simulated, so that the\ndetermination of the exponent \u03b2 from the slopes in the\nlog-log-plots Fig.7 and 8 is not very accurate. We estimate\n\u001a\n0.78 \u00b1 0.08 for d = 1,\n\u03b2=\n(16)\n0.53 \u00b1 0.05 for d = 2,\n\nto this Section we carefully checked that the system sizes\nwere big enough to exclude finite size effects.\nIn analogy to Eq.(11) we expect that the power law\ndecay of cA \u221d t\u2212\u03b2 stops, when\nrE (cA ldD )2/d \u2248 1,\n\n(17)\n\ncA ldD \u2248 1,\n\n(18)\n\nor\n\nwhichever happens first. Replacing cA by H \u2212\u03b2 , this implies that the width H of the interdiffusion zone should\nbe given by\nd/\u03b2\n\nH \u2248 lD\n\nfor rE \u226b 1\n\n(19)\n\nand\n\nwhich are indicated by the dashed lines in the two Figures. Both exponents are significantly smaller than \u03b2 = 1\nobtained for infinite D/F , i.e. cA decays more slowly for\nfinite than for infinite D/F .\nThis result is surprising on first sight, because there are\nmore island edges on the surface for finite D/F , hence\nmore possible places, where A-atoms may be overgrown.\nThat cA decays more slowly nevertheless, may be explained by the fact, that the nucleation of islands does\nnot happen anywhere with equal probability as for infinite D/F , but preferentially far away from the holes in\nthe previous layer, where the A-atoms are concentrated.\nTherefore overgrowth is less likely, and cA decays more\nslowly than for infinite D/F .\nThis raises the question, how big the parameter D/F\nmust be in order to see the exponent \u03b2 = 1 instead of\nthe smaller one. The answer is, that the system size\nL must be small compared to lD in order to obtain the\ncrossover to the faster decay of cA . This was confirmed by\nsimulation results in [18]. In the four Figures belonging\n\n\u221a\nH \u2248 ( rE lD )d/\u03b2\n\nfor rE \u226a 1.\n\nIn analogy to Eq.(13) we postulate then that\n\u0012 \u0013\nt\n1\ncA = \u03b2 g\nH\nH\n\n(20)\n\n(21)\n\nwith\ng(\u03c4 ) \u223c 1/\u03c4 \u03b2\n\nfor \u03c4 \u226a 1,\n\n(22)\n\nbecause cA is independent of H for small t.\nWe first checked these conjectures for rE > 1, where\nthe surface concentration of A's becomes independent of\nrE , as expected.

RATE EQUATION APPROACH\n\nIn this Section we extend the established rate equation\napproach for submonolayer homoepitaxial growth as described in [21,22], in order to apply it to our model for\nsurface interdiffusion. Our approach describes the time\nevolution of four submonolayer quantities: The density\nof mobile adatoms \u03c1, the total island density I, the density of mobile adatoms of type B, \u03c1B , and the density of\npotential exchange partners of type A in the lower layer,\n\u03c1A . With these quantities, the rate equations are as follows:\n\nFor D/F = 107 we could only check this for about one\ndecade of rE -values: For d = 1 we found that already for\nrE = 0.3 the crossover into the regime, where H becomes\nindependent of rE , affects the data. For rE < 10\u22123 the\nexchange was so weak that the surface concentration of\nA's decayed very fast from the beginning, so that a convincing data collapse was not possible. Similar problems\noccurred for d=2. The best result of our attempts to get\na data collapse in the available rE -interval are shown in\nFig.9 for d = 1 and Fig. 10 for d = 2. The effective\nexponents turn out to be very different from the ones\npredicted in Eq.(26).\n\n\u03c1\u0307 = F \u2212 D\u03c1(I + 2\u03c1),\nI \u0307 = D\u03c12 ,\n\n(28)\n2\n\n\u03c1\u0307B = F \u2212 D\u03c1B (I + \u03c1 + \u03c1B ) \u2212 Ea \u03c1A \u03c1B ,\n\u03c1\u0307A = \u2212Ea2 \u03c1A \u03c1B \u2212 \u03c1A a2 D\u03c1(I + 2\u03c1).\n7\n\n(29)\n(30)\n(31)\n\n\f\u03c1\u0302 is linear in t\u0302, and I\u02c6 increases with t\u03023 . At late times,\nt\u0302 \u226b 1, one gets \u03c1\u0302 \u221d t\u03021/3 and I\u02c6 \u221d t\u0302\u22121/3 .\nWith these results, the last two equations can be solved\nanalytically in a similar way for the early-time regime,\nt\u0302 \u226a 1. For equation (34), the second term on the right\nhand side can be neglected in this limit. If we also neglect\nthe time dependence of \u03c1\u0302A (t) \u2248 \u03c1\u0302A (0) = \u0109A (n), we get\n\nWhile the first two equations are identical to the well\nknown point-island model rate equations for homoepitaxial growth, the last two are specific to our heteroepitaxial\nmodel. The third one expresses the change in density of\nthe B-type adatoms. Its positive contribution describes\nthe depostition of new adatoms. The first negative term\nrepresents the loss of B-adatoms, when they get incorporated into islands or bind to another adatom to nucleate a new island. The extra term D\u03c12B accounts for\nthe fact that nucleation events involving two B-adatoms\ncount twice as much as those between a B- and an Aadatom, because they remove two B-adatoms simultaneously. The last term of Eq.(30) describes the exchange of\nmobile B's with A's. Equation (31) expresses the annihilation of possible A-type exchange partners in the lower\nlayer. Since this value is monotoneously decreasing, there\nis no positive contribution. The negative terms describe\nthe exchange of A's with mobile B's, and the overgrowth\nof A's due to propagating island edges and nucleation\nevents.\nRescaling the variables (see [21]) according to t\u0302 = tF l20 ,\n\u03c1\u0302 = \u03c1l20 , I\u02c6 = Il20 , \u03c1\u0302A = \u03c1A l20 , \u03c1\u0302B = \u03c1B l20 , where l0 =\n(D/F )1/4 , leads to the dimensionless equations\n\u03c1\u0302 \u0307 = 1 \u2212 \u03c1\u0302(I\u02c6 + 2\u03c1\u0302),\n \u0307\nI\u02c6 = \u03c1\u03022 ,\n\u03c1\u0302 \u0307 B = 1 \u2212 \u03c1\u0302B (I\u02c6 + \u03c1\u0302 + \u03c1\u0302B ) \u2212 rE \u03c1\u0302A \u03c1\u0302B ,\n2\n\n\u03c1\u0302 \u0307 A = \u2212rE \u03c1\u0302A \u03c1\u0302B \u2212 (a/l0 ) \u03c1\u0302A \u03c1\u0302(I\u02c6 + 2\u03c1\u0302).\n\n\u03c1\u0302 \u0307 B \u2248 1 \u2212 rE \u0109A \u03c1\u0302B\n\nThis equation relaxes into a steady state with \u03c1\u0302B,\u221e \u221d\n1/(rE \u0109A ) after a characteristic time t\u0302\u2217 \u2248 1/(rE \u0109A (n)).\nFor even smaller times, t\u0302 \u226a t\u0302\u2217 , we can also neglect the\nother right hand side term, and we get \u03c1\u0302B \u221d t\u0302.\nPlugging these results into Eq.(35), and realizing that\nthe second term on the right hand side can be neglected\ncompared to the first one, we get\n\u03c1\u0302A \u221d e\u2212t\u0302/\u0109A \u2248 (1 \u2212\n\nt\u0302\n)\n\u0109A\n\nfor\n\nt\u0302\u2217 \u226a t\u0302 \u226a 1\n\n(39)\n\nand\n2\n\n\u03c1\u0302A \u221d e\u2212rE t\u0302 \u2248 (1 \u2212 rE t\u03022 )\n\nfor\n\nt\u0302 \u226a t\u0302\u2217\n\n.\n\n(40)\n\nTo relate these findings to our results in the other\nsections, we employed an iteration scheme for the rate\nequation system to obtain the surface concentration of\nA's for every deposited integer monolayer. Starting\nfrom the substrate (\u03c1A (0) = cA (0) = 1) we can obtain\n\u03c1A (1) = cA (1) from Eq.(37) by solving Eqs.(32) \u2013 (35)\nnumerically. Plugging cA (1) back into our rate equations\nas the initial surface concentration, that is \u03c1A (0) = cA (1),\nwe get \u03c1A (1) = cA (2) by using Eq.(37) again. Repeating\nthis iteration scheme leads to cA (t).\n\n(32)\n(33)\n(34)\n(35)\n\nIf we consider systems in perfect layer-by-layer growth\nmode, this approach not only holds for the submonolayer\nregime starting from the substrate, but also starting after integer numbers of deposited monolayers.

One can clearly observe power law\n8\n\n\fdecay for high D/F values at intermediate times, and\na similar scaling behaviour as obtained from the simulations. The exponent of the power law behaviour is\napproximately \u22121, which is identical to the result from\nthe simulations for perfect layer-by-layer growth mode,\nD/F \u2192 \u221e. This fact supports our argumentation concerning the different exponents for D/F \u2192 \u221e and finite\nD/F in section VII: Since the rate equations cannot describe the clustering of the A-atoms, they also do not\nreflect the preference of the nucleation sites to be far\nfrom the A-clusters. The observed scaling exponent of\n1/2\nl02 = (D/F )\ndoesn't match any of the exponents resulting from the simulations. This is in general agreement with the analytical calculation of the exponents in\nsection V: There we derived the scaling exponents from\ncharacteristic properties of the A-clusters, which are totally neglected in the presented rate equation approach.\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nHere we describe, how we implemented the model introduced in Sec. II for one dimensional surfaces in the\nlimit D/F \u2192 \u221e. We first describe the idea for the scale\nfree limit, where also E/D \u2192 \u221e.\nFor D/F \u2192 \u221e one has perfect layer-by-layer growth.\nThe nucleation of a new layer happens at an arbitrary\nposition. Afterwards there is at most one adatom on the\nsurface. The idea is to calculate the probabilities exactly,\nwith which the adatom reaches the nearest sinks to its\nleft and to its right. For an A-adatom these are the island\nedges, while for a B-adatom it might also be an A-atom,\nwith which it could exchange. Let dL (dR ) denote the\ndistance to the nearest sink to the left (right).\nAs shown in [23], the probability pL to reach the left\nposition prior to the right one with unbiased diffusion is\ngiven by\n\nIX. CONCLUSION\n\npL =\n\nIn the present work we have investigated heteroepitaxial growth of B-particles on an A-substrate. Introducing\nan exchange mechanism for B-adatoms, when they encounter an A-atom in the uppermost layer, we observed\nthat in the limit of layer-by-layer growth the top layer\nconcentration of A-atoms decays algebraically. Therefore, the resulting interdiffusion zone has a broad profile\nwith a diverging width. Varying the rate E at which\nA-atoms and B-atoms are exchanged did not change the\nexponent of this power law. A different situation has\nbeen observed, as we varied the diffusion constant D.\nFor finite values of D a crossover from power law to exponential decay has been found. The crossover time H is\ngiven by (D/F )0.3 for d = 1 and by (D/F )0.6 for d = 2.\nIt would be very interesting to have some experimental\nresults for the concentration of substrate atoms in the\ngrowing layer in the case of heteroepitaxy. The results we\nfound suggest that in order to provide a sharp interface\nbetween substrate and deposited material one should use\nsmall D/F .\n\ndR\ndR + dL\n\n(41)\n\nCorrespondingly, pR = 1 \u2212 pL . Therefore, it is not necessary to simulate the whole random walk of an adatom,\nbut it suffices to select the final position according to\n(41).\nThus in the scale free limit the model (after nucleation\nof a new layer) may be simulated as follows:\n(1) Deposition of a Bat a randomly chosen site i.\n(2) Determination of the distances dL and dR followed by\na decision for a side according to the probabilities given\nin (41).\n(3) If the final position of the B-adatom is an A-site, the\natoms exchange (as E/D \u2192 \u221e). In this case the Aadatom goes to the left or right island edge according to\n(41). If the final postition of the B-adatom is an island\nedge, it is bound there irreversibly possibly overgrowing\nan A-atom. Then one returns to step (1) and deposits\nthe next B-atom.\nThis algorithm can be generalized for finite rE = E/D:\nNot always, when a B-adatom encounters an exchange\npartner A, they exchange immediately. This happens\nonly with probability pE = E/(E + 2D), where the denominator is the sum of the rates for the three possible\nactions of the adatom \u2013 exchange with the A-atom underneath, a hop to the right neighbour and a hop to the left\nneighbour. With probability pE the B-adatom is replaced\nby an A-adatom, which attaches to the island edges to its\nleft with probability Eq.(41), and otherwise to the island\nedge to its right; 1 \u2212 pE is the probability that the Badatom continues to diffuse until it encounters the next\nA-atom or attaches to the island edge.\nIn order to avoid simulating the random walk explicitely, one has to calculate the probabilities analytically, that the B-adatom exchanges with any particular\nof the A-atoms or attaches to the island edges. Technically speaking, the B-atom is a random walker on a one-\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe are very grateful to H. Hinrichsen, L. Brendel, V.\nUzdin, U. Koehler, C. Wolf and A.

In order to\ncalculate the absorption probabilities at the different absorbers, which depend on the deposition site, we consider\nan incoming flux (normalized to 1) of independent random walkers at the deposition site xS (source) and determine the outgoing fluxes at the absorption sites (sinks).\nThe absorption probability is then the steady state fraction of the incoming flux that leaves the system at the\nrespective absorption site.\nThe density of random walkers at a site x evolves according to\n\u03c1\u0307(x, t) = D[\u03c1(x \u2212 1, t) \u2212 2\u03c1(x, t) + \u03c1(x + 1, t)]\n\u2212E\u03c1(x, t)\u03c1A (x) + \u03b4x,xS ,\n\nat the different A-sites or absorbed by the island edges.\nBy choosing a random number we decide which site to\npick. If it is an island edge, the B-atom is moved there,\nand the next B-atom is deposited at a random position.\nOtherwise we move the B-atom to the chosen site, exchange it with the A-atom there, let another random\nnumber determine, whether to attach the A-atom to the\nleft or right island boundary, and deposit the next Batom at a random position.\nThe complexity of this algorithm is linear in the number of A-atoms left on the surface, while a brute force\nsimulation of the diffusion would cost much more computing time proportional to L2 .\n\n(42)\n\nwhere the density of partial absorbers, \u03c1A (x), is 1 at all\nthe sites xA , where an A-atom sits, and 0 otherwise:\n\u03c1A (x) =\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03b4x,xA\u03bd .\n\n[1] U.
