While type (i) is more relevant when\nthe oscillation is related to the change in volume to which\nthe electron is confined (breathing modes), type (ii) is rel-\n\n\u2217 Corresponding author.\nFax: +38661 477-3724.\n\nE-mail address: jernej.mravlje@ijs.si,\n\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier\n\nevant whenever the displacement modulates the hopping\nprobability.\nThe addition of the Holstein term to the Anderson Hamiltonian effectively reduces the Coulomb repulsion and the\nhybridization \u0393. The effect of the electrons on the phonon\npropagator is also interesting: when effective U changes\nsign, a peak in the phonon propagator at reduced frequencies (the 'soft mode') emerges [1,2]. The soft mode is related to the charge susceptibility, which is increased in this\nregime [3].\nVery recently, similar behavior was found also in the case\nwhere the electron-phonon coupling term is of the form\nHel\u2212ph = gxvodd , where vodd describes the hopping from\nimpurity orbital to the odd conduction channel (antisymmetric combination of the orbitals of the noninteracting\npart of the Hamiltonian) [4]. The model without phonons\nconsist of veven , which couples the impurity only to the even\nconduction channel (symmetric combination of orbitals of\nthe noninteracting part of Hamiltonian).\nThe same model (but for finite U instead of U \u2192 \u221e\ntreatment of Ref. [4]) was analyzed also with the variational projection-operator method [5]. In this method the\nground state is expressed in terms of the ground state of\nan auxiliary noninteracting Hamiltonian [6]. Several variants were tested, with parameters chosen so as to allow for\ncoupling, (i) only to even channel, (ii) only to odd channel,\n(iii) a combination of both.

As discussed below, the ground state\nshould have a well defined parity, therefore only the variants (i) and (ii) of the variational procedure correspond to\nthe ground state of correct symmetry. While it would be instructive to implement the variational method in a manner\nwhich correctly took into account the tunneling between\nthe classically degenerate minima of the oscillator potential [4], it currently appears that the implementation would\nrequire calculating matrix elements between two distinct\nHartree-Fock vacua, which precludes the use of Wick's theorem upon which our current implementation of the variational procedure is based [6].\nWe thus present preliminary results obtained with the\nNRG method, which does not suffer from this problem.\nThe parity in NRG results is not broken; the expectation\nvalues of the displacement and of the hopping term vodd\nthus vanish. In Fig. 2(a) we compare the fluctuations of\nhopping to even and odd channels as a measure of the 'activity' of corresponding channels. For g large enough the\nlatter are larger, corresponding to increased fluctuations of\nthe displacement and the emergence of the soft mode. The\nground state of the system, as seen from the NRG renormalization flow (not shown here) corresponds to the Fermi\nliquid ground state of the single-channel Kondo problem\n[7] with the characteristic quasi-particle scattering phase\nshift \u03b4q.p \u223c \u03c0/2 in the even or odd channel, depending on\nwhether the effective phonon mediated coupling to the odd\nchannel is smaller or larger than the direct coupling to the\neven channel. When the couplings match (marked in Fig.\n2(b) by vertical lines), an unstable fixed-point of the twochannel Kondo model type is found.\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n0.6\n\u03b4/U\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nFigure 3.

Corresponding conductance is also plotted\n(dashed). Note that the phase shifts are defined modulo \u03c0.\n\nIn Fig. 3 the scattering phase-shifts are plotted as a\nfunction of \u03b4. The coupling to the phonon-assisted channel\nis chosen so that in the ground state the impurity spin is\nscreened by the odd channel for small \u03b4, while for larger \u03b4 it\nis screened by the even channel, as seen from \u03b4q.p.;even,odd \u223c\n\u03c0/2, respectively. Further away from the symmetric point\nthe model is tuned into the valence fluctuating regime\nwhere the Kondo effect is suppressed. When the model is\nused to describe a molecule (or a quantum dot) embedded\nbetween two leads, the scattering phase shifts directly determine the differential conductance (Fig. 3 dashed). The\nconductance curve shown is qualitatively equal to that of\nthe generic one-electron transistor in the single-channel\nKondo regime, despite the fact that the Kondo effects\noccurs in different channels as the gate voltage is swept.\nThe work was supported by SRA under grant Pl-0044.\n\nReferences\n[1] A.
