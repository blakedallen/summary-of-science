Its importance lies in the fact\nthat systematic analyses of LRG open the possibility of extracting New Physics from hard\ndiffractive processes. On the theoretical side, its significance is due to the reliance of the\nh|S|2i calculation on subtle QCD methods.\nRapidity gaps are defined as regions of angular phase space devoid of particles [1, 2, 3, 4,\n5], and at high-energy hadron-hadron collisions it has been suggested that their observation\nmay serve as a signature for production of Higgs bosons and other colour-singlet systems via\nfusion of electroweak bosons [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. However, as pointed out by Bjorken [4, 5],\nwe are not able to distinguish between the theoretically calculated rate of a large rapidity\ngap, Fgap , and the actual measured rate, fgap . These rates are related by the proportionality\nrelation fgap = h|S|2i Fgap , where h|S|2i is the so called \"survival probability\" of a large\nrapidity gap: it gives the probability of survival of LRG and not the probability for the\nproduction and survival of LRG, which is the quantity actually measured. More specifically,\nthe survival factor h|S|2i gives the probability of a large rapidity gap not to be filled by\ndebris originated from the rescattering of spectator partons (h|Sspec|2 i), or from the emission\nof bremsstrahlung gluons from partons (h|Sbrem|2 i). Hence we can write\nh|S|2i = h|Sbrem (\u2206y = |y1 \u2212 y2 |)|2 ih|Sspec(s)|2 i,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere y1 and y2 are the rapidities of the jets (produced with large transverse momenta),\n\u2206y = |y1 \u2212 y2 | \u226b 1, and s is the square of the total center-of-mass (CM) energy. The\n\nfactor h|Sbrem (\u2206y)|2i, which depends on the value of the LRG as well as on the kinematics\n\nof each specific process, can be calculated using perturbative QCD [33]. On the other hand,\nthe survival factor h|Sspec|2 i cannot be calculated perturbatively: it takes account of soft\nrescatterings in both the initial and final state interactions. To calculate h|Sspec|2 i we need\n\nto obtain the probability of the two incoming hadrons do not interact inelastically, i.e. the\nprobability of large rapidity gaps do not be populated by additional hadrons produced from\nthe rescattering of spectator degrees of freedom. As discussed by Gotsman, Levin and Maor\nsome time ago, this task is a difficult one since partons at long distances contribute to such\na calculation [10]. However, the survival probability can be properly defined in the impact\n2\n\n\fparameter space [4, 5]:\n2\n\nh|Sspec| i =\n\nR\n\nd2~b F (b, s) P (b, s)\n,\nR\nd2~b F (b, s)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere b is the impact parameter, F (b, s) is a factor related to the overlap of the parton\ndensities in the colliding hadrons in the transverse impact plane, and P (b, s) is the probability\nthat the two incoming hadrons have not undergone a inelastic scattering at the parton\nlevel. The above definition sets up the stage for carrying out a systematic computation\nof h|Sspec|2 i, since the probability P (b, s) can be easily obtained, for example, from the\nQCD-inspired eikonal approach [11, 12, 13, 14]. In this picture the probability that neither\nhadron is broken up in a collision at impact parameter b is given by P (b, s) = e\u22122\u03c7I (b,s) , where\n\u03c7I (b, s) is the imaginary part of the eikonal function. In QCD-inspired eikonal models the\nincrease of the total cross sections is associated with semihard scatterings of partons in\nthe hadrons, and the high energy dependence of the cross sections is driven mainly by\ngluon-gluon scattering processes. Nevertheless, the gluon-gluon subprocess cross section is\npotentially divergent at small transferred momenta, and the usual procedure to regulate this\nbehaviour is the introduction of a purely ad hoc parameter separating the perturbative from\nthe non-perturbative QCD region, like an infrared mass scale [11, 12], or a cut-off at low\ntransverse momentum pT [13, 14].\nRecently we introduced a QCD-based eikonal model where the ad hoc infrared mass scale\nwas substituted by a dynamical gluon mass one [15]. One of the central advantages of the\nmodel is that it gives a precise physical meaning for the quoted infrared scale. Furthermore,\nsince the behaviour of the running coupling constant is constrained by the value of dynamical\ngluon mass [16, 17], the model also has a smaller number of parameters than similar QCD\nmodels.\nIn this letter we perform a detailed computation of the survival probability in pp and p\u0304p\nchannels in the framework of the QCD eikonal model with a gluon dynamical mass. We\nare concerned with the calculation of h|Sspec|2 i, the probability that LRG survive the soft\n\nrescattering of spectator partons, which we shall denote henceforth simply as h|S|2i. In the\n\nnext section we introduce the QCD eikonal model and address the question of calculating\nthe survival factor h|S|2i from processes of Higgs boson production through W fusion. The\n\nresults are presented in the Sec. III, where we provide a systematic study of h|S|2i and its\nsensitivity to the infrared mass scale. The conclusions are drawn in Sec. IV.\n3\n\n\fII.\n\nLARGE RAPIDITY GAPS AND THE DYNAMICAL GLUON MASS\n\nIt has been suggested that in hadron-hadron collisions the production of Higgs bosons\ncan occur by means of the fusion of gluons or electroweak bosons [1, 2, 3, 4]. The two main\nHiggs production mechanisms are the gluon fusion gg \u2192 H and the W fusion W W \u2192 H.\nIn the gluon fusion process each hadron emits a gluon (a colour octet), and the Higgs boson\nis coupled to each one through a fermion loop. Since the Higgs boson couples to fermions\naccording to their masses, its production cross section via gluon fusion is dominated by top\nquark loops. In gluon fusion the hadrons remnants must exchange colour with each other\nin order to become singlet states again.\nOn the other hand, the W fusion process has a different colour flow structure: since the\nincoming hadrons (as well as the W bosons) are colour singlets, when they emit a W boson\nthey remain as singlet states. Thus no colour is exchanged between the scattered partons,\nand the two outgoing hadron remnant states are expected to be separated by a central\nrapidity gap. As indicated in the previous section, the survival probability of these rapidity\ngaps can be naturally defined in the impact parameter representation. In this formalism the\ninclusive differential Higgs boson production cross section via W fusion is given by\nd\u03c3prod\n= \u03c3W W \u2192H W (b; \u03bcW ),\nd2~b\n\n(3)\n\nwhere W (b; \u03bcW ) is the overlap function at impact parameter space of the W bosons. This\nfunction represents the effective density of the overlapping W boson distributions in the\ncolliding hadrons. The cross section for producing the Higgs boson and having a large\nrapidity gap is given by\nd\u03c3LRG\n= \u03c3W W \u2192H W (b; \u03bcW ) P (b, s),\nd2~b\n\n(4)\n\nwhere P (b, s) is the probability that the two initial hadrons have not undergone a inelastic\nscattering at the parton level. In QCD-inspired eikonal models this probability is given\nby P (b, s) = e\u22122\u03c7I (b,s) , where the imaginary part \u03c7I (b, s) of the eikonal function receives\ncontributions of parton-parton interactions. Therefore, the factor P (b, s) suppresses the\ncontribution to the Higgs boson cross section where the two initial hadrons overlap and\nthere is soft rescatterings of the spectator partons. From the expressions (2), (3) and (4) we\n\n4\n\n\fcan write down the survival factor h|S|2 i for Higgs production via W fusion:\nR 2\nd ~b \u03c3W W \u2192H W (b; \u03bcW ) e\u22122\u03c7I (b,s)\nh|S|2i =\nR\nd2~b \u03c3W W \u2192H W (b; \u03bcW )\nZ\n=\nd2~b W (b; \u03bcW ) e\u22122\u03c7I (b,s) ,\nwhere we have used the normalization condition\n\nR\n\n(5)\n\nd2~b W (b; \u03bcW ) = 1. In this letter we shall\n\ncompute the probability factor P (b, s) = e\u22122\u03c7I (b,s) using a recently developed QCD eikonal\nmodel, where the onset of the dominance of gluons in the interaction of high-energy hadrons\nis managed by the dynamical gluon mass scale [15]. The model, henceforth referred to\nas DGM model, satisfies analyticity and unitarity constraints. The latter is automatically\nsatisfied in the eikonal representation, where the total cross section, the ratio \u03c1 of the real to\nthe imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude, and the differential elastic scattering\ncross section are given by\n\u03c3tot (s) = 4\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\nand\n\nb db [1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c7I (b,s) cos \u03c7R (b, s)],\n\nR\nRe{i b db [1 \u2212 ei\u03c7(b,s) ]}\nR\n\u03c1(s) =\n,\nIm{i b db [1 \u2212 ei\u03c7(b,s) ]}\nd\u03c3el\n1\n(s, t) =\ndt\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n2\n\nb db [1 \u2212 ei\u03c7(b,s) ] J0 (qb) ,\n\n(8)\n\nrespectively, where s is the square of the total CM energy, J0 (x) is the Bessel function of the\nfirst kind, and \u03c7(b, s) = \u03c7R (b, s) + i\u03c7I (b, s) is the (complex) eikonal function. In the DGM\nmodel the eikonal function is written as a combination of an even and odd eikonal terms\nrelated by crossing symmetry. In terms of the proton-proton (pp) and antiproton-proton\n+\n\u2212\n(p\u0304p) scatterings, this combination reads \u03c7p\u0304p\npp (b, s) = \u03c7 (b, s) \u00b1 \u03c7 (b, s). The even eikonal is\n\nwritten as the sum of gluon-gluon, quark-gluon, and quark-quark contributions:\n\u03c7+ (b, s) = \u03c7qq (b, s) + \u03c7qg (b, s) + \u03c7gg (b, s)\n= i[\u03c3qq (s)W (b; \u03bcqq ) + \u03c3qg (s)W (b; \u03bcqg ) + \u03c3gg (s)W (b; \u03bcgg )],\n\n(9)\n\nwhere W (b; \u03bc) is the overlap function at impact parameter space and \u03c3ij (s) are the elementary subprocess cross sections of colliding quarks and gluons (i, j = q, g). The overlap\n5\n\n\ffunction, normalized so that\na dipole form factor,\n\nR\n\nd2~b W (b; \u03bc) = 1, is associated with the Fourier transform of\n\nW (b; \u03bc) =\n\n\u03bc2\n(\u03bcb)3 K3 (\u03bcb),\n96\u03c0\n\n(10)\n\nwhere K3 (x) is the modified Bessel function of second kind. The odd eikonal \u03c7\u2212 (b, s), that\naccounts for the difference between pp and p\u0304p channels, is parametrized as\nmg\n\u03c7\u2212 (b, s) = C \u2212 \u03a3 \u221a ei\u03c0/4 W (b; \u03bc\u2212 ),\ns\n\n(11)\n\nwhere mg is the dynamical gluon mass and the parameters C \u2212 and \u03bc\u2212 are constants to be\nfitted. The factor \u03a3 is defined as\n9\u03c0 \u1fb1s2 (0)\n,\nm2g\n\n\u03a3=\n\n(12)\n\nwith the dynamical coupling constant \u1fb1s set at its frozen infrared value. The origin of the\ndynamical gluon mass and the frozen coupling constant can be traced back to the early work\nof Cornwall [16], and the formal expressions of these quantities can be seen in Ref. [15].\nThe eikonal functions \u03c7qq (b, s) and \u03c7qg (b, s), needed to describe the lower-energy forward\ndata, are simply parametrized with terms dictated by the Regge phenomenology:\nmg\n\u03c7qq (b, s) = i \u03a3 A \u221a W (b; \u03bcqq ),\ns\n\u0014\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03c7qg (b, s) = i \u03a3 A + B ln\n\n\u0012\n\ns\nm2g\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\nW (b;\n\n(13)\n\u221a\n\n\u03bcqq \u03bcgg ),\n\n(14)\n\nwhere A, A\u2032 , B \u2032 , \u03bcqq and \u03bcgg are fitting parameters. The gluon-gluon eikonal contribution,\nthat dominates at high energy and determines the asymptotic behaviour of the total cross\nDP T\nsections, is written as \u03c7gg (b, s) \u2261 \u03c3gg\n(s)W (b; \u03bcgg ), where\nZ 1\nDP T\nDP T\n\u2032\nd\u03c4 Fgg (\u03c4 ) \u03c3\u0302gg\n(\u015d).\n\u03c3gg (s) = C\n\n(15)\n\n4m2g /s\n\nDP T\nHere Fgg (\u03c4 ) is the convoluted structure function for pair gg, \u03c3\u0302gg\n(\u015d) is the subprocess\n\ncross section and C \u2032 is a fitting parameter. In the above expression it is introduced the\nenergy threshold \u015d \u2265 4m2g for the final state gluons, assuming that these are screened gluons\n[18]. The structure function Fgg (\u03c4 ) is given by\nZ\nFgg (\u03c4 ) = [g \u2297 g](\u03c4 ) =\n\n\u03c4\n\n6\n\n1\n\n\u0010\u03c4 \u0011\ndx\n,\ng(x) g\nx\nx\n\n(16)\n\n\fwhere g(x) is the gluon distribution function, adopted as\ng(x) = Ng\nwhere J = 1 + \u01eb and Ng =\n\n1\n(6\n240\n\n(1 \u2212 x)5\n,\nxJ\n\n(17)\n\n\u2212 \u01eb)(5 \u2212 \u01eb)...(1 \u2212 \u01eb). The correct analyticity properties\n\nof the model amplitudes is ensured by substituting s \u2192 se\u2212i\u03c0/2 throughout Eqs. (13), (14)\nand (15).\nDP T\nIn the expression (15) the gluon-gluon subprocess cross section \u03c3\u0302gg\n(\u015d) is calculated\n\nusing a procedure dictated by the dynamical perturbation theory (DPT) [19]: amplitudes\nthat do not vanish to all orders of perturbation theory are given by their free-field values,\nwhereas amplitudes that vanish in all orders in perturbation theory as \u221d exp (\u22121/g 2 ) (g is\nthe coupling constant) are retained at lowest order. In our case this means that the effects\nof the dynamical gluon mass in the propagators and vertices are retained, and the sum of\npolarizations is performed for massless (free-field) gluons. As a result, since the dynamical\nmasses go to zero at large momenta, the elementary cross sections of perturbative QCD in\nthe high-energy limit are recovered. Other details of the calculation can be seen in Ref. [15].\nAccording to the expression (5), the final step in order to calculate h|S|2i is to determine\nthe overlap function W (b; \u03bcW ) of the electroweak bosons. It is worth mentioning that the\nsurvival factor h|S|2 i depends on the nature of the colour-singlet exchange which generates\nthe gap as well as on the distributions of partons inside the proton in impact parameter\nspace [10, 20, 21, 22, 23]. We simply assume that the distribution of W bosons in impact\nparameter space in the hadron is the same as for the quarks. In this way, we can finally\nwrite down a phenomenologically useful expression to the survival factor h|S|2i:\nZ \u221e\n2\nh|S| i = 2\u03c0\nb db W (b; \u03bcqq ) e\u22122\u03c7I (b,s) .\n\n(18)\n\n0\n\nIn the above expression the inverse size (in impact parameter) \u03bcqq is the same as in\nthe expression (13). Its value, as well as the value of the remaining fitting parameters, is\ndetermined from global fits to pp and p\u0304p forward scattering data, as discussed in the next\nsection.\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS\n\nIn order to determine the exponential damping factor e\u22122\u03c7I (b,s) of Eq. (18) and produce\na consistent estimate of h|S|2i, we carry out global fits to the elastic differential scattering\n7\n\n\f\u221a\ncross section for p\u0304p at s = 1.8 TeV and to all high-energy forward pp and p\u0304p scattering\n\u221a\ndata above s = 15 GeV. This energy threshold is the same one used in the estimate of\nh|S|2i through the analysis of pp and p\u0304p scattering carried out by Block and Halzen using a\nprevious QCD-inspired model [8]. The forward data sets include the total cross section (\u03c3tot )\nand the ratio of the real to imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude (\u03c1). We use\nthe data sets compiled and analyzed by the Particle Data Group [24], with the statistic and\nsystematic errors added in quadrature. The input values of the mg have been chosen to lie\nin the interval [350, 650] MeV, as suggested by the value mg = 400+350\n\u2212100 MeV obtained in a\nprevious analysis of the pp and p\u0304p channels via the DGM model [15]. This input dynamical\ngluon mass range is also supported by recent studies on the \u03b3p photoproduction and the\nhadronic \u03b3\u03b3 total cross sections [25], and on the behaviour of the gluon distribution function\nat small x [26]. In all the fits performed in this letter we use a \u03c72 fitting procedure, assuming\nan interval \u03c72 \u2212 \u03c72min corresponding, in the case of normal errors, to the projection of the\n\u03c72 hypersurface containing 90% of probability. In the case of the DGM model (8 fitting\n\nparameters) this corresponds to the interval \u03c72 \u2212 \u03c72min = 13.36.\n\nThe \u03c72 /DOF values obtained in the global fits are relatively low, as show in Table I.\n\nThese results (for 168 degrees of freedom) indicate the excellence of the fits and show that\nthe DGM model naturally accommodates all the data sets used in the fitting procedure.\nIn Table I we have included the values of the \u03bcW (\u2261 \u03bcqq ) parameter, which determines the\nspatial distribution of the W bosons at the impact parameter b. We can observe a small\ndependence of their values on the dynamical gluon mass: the greater the input scale mg ,\nthe smaller the inverse size \u03bcW .\nThe sensitivity of the survival probability h|S|2i (for pp collisions) to the gluon dynamical\nmass is shown in Figure 1 for some CM energies. We note a slow increase of their values with\nthe dynamical gluon mass and a fast decrease with the CM energies. As shown in Figure\n2, where we have also plotted the exponential damping factor, this behaviour is related to\nthe energy dependence of the imaginary part of the eikonal: \u03c7I (b, s) grows with the energy\nand hence suppresses the integral (18). In Table II we list our results for the survival factor\nh|S|2i for some values of the proton-proton energy, and compare with other calculations in\n\nthe literature, where h|S|2iDGM 1 and h|S|2 iDGM 2 denote the results obtained by setting the\n\nmass infrared scale at mg = 400 and 600 MeV, respectively. The last value is the same\none adopted by Block and Halzen with respect to the ad hoc mass scale m0 [8]. We see\n8\n\n\fthat the DGM results are systematically larger than the Block-Halzen ones (denoted by\nh|S|2iBH ), but the large statistical errors resulting from our choice for the confidence region\n\nof the parameters (CL=90 %) indicate a reasonable compatibility between the h|S|2 iDGM 1\n\nand h|S|2iBH results at higher energies.\n\u221a\nThe h|S|2iDGM 2 results at s = 1.8 and 16 TeV are in line with the h|S|2iGLM 1 ones,\nobtained by Gotsman and collaborators using a Regge pole model [27]. In their approach\nthey use an eikonalized version of the Donnachie-Landshoff model in order to satisfy unitarity\n[28]. The authors argue that their relatively large values for h|S|2 i can be reduced by an\nappropriate change in some parameters included in their Gaussian approximation for F (b, s)\nand P (b, s) factors. We hasten to emphasise that the h|S|2 iDGM 1 results have been obtained\nusing the preferred statistical value of the dynamical gluon mass for pp and p\u0304p scattering,\nnamely mg = 400 GeV [15]. In this case we believe that an eventual change in the parameters\nof the GLM1 model may reduce their results in such a way to be compatible with the DGM1\nones.\nThe h|S|2iKM R results have been obtained by Khoze and collaborators using a two-channel\neikonal model which embodies pion-loop insertions in the Pomeron trajectory, diffractive dissociation, and rescattering effects [20]. The authors have calculated the survival probability\nh|S|2i in single, central and double diffractive processes at several energies, assuming that\nthe spatial distribution in the parameter space is controlled by the slope b of the Pomeronproton vertex. We show the h|S|2 iKM R results for double diffractive processes with 2b = 5.5\nGeV2 , which corresponds to the slope of the electromagnetic proton form factor. These re-\n\nsults are compatible with the DGM ones, in particular with the results taking into account\nmg = 400 MeV, the optimum value for the dynamical gluon mass in pp and p\u0304p diffractive\nscattering [15].\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this letter we have calculated the survival probability h|S|2i of large rapidity gaps by\nmeans of an eikonal QCD model with a dynamical gluon mass. Since rapidity gaps can\noccur from production of Higgs boson via fusion of electroweak bosons, we have focused\non W W \u2192 H fusion processes. The eikonal function have been determined by fitting pp\nand p\u0304p accelerator scattering data. Owing to the quality of the global fits, the DGM model\n9\n\n\fallows us to describe successfully the p\u0304p differential cross section at\n\n\u221a\n\ns = 1.8 TeV, as well as\n\np\u0304p,pp\nthe forward scattering quantities \u03c3tot\nand \u03c1p\u0304p,pp, in excellent agreement with the available\n\nexperimental data. These results show that the DGM model is well suited for the prediction\nof the survival probability of LRG at higher energies, in particular for h|S|2i one at the\nCERN-LHC energy.\nIn Table II we list our results for h|S|2i and notice that their values decrease with the\nincrease of the energy of the incoming protons. This behaviour, in line with results for LRG\ndijet production at the Tevatron [29, 30], is a direct consequence of the energy dependence\nof the imaginary part of the eikonal, that grows with the energy. A strong dependence of\nh|S|2i on the dynamical gluon mass mg emerges from our calculations, as shown in Figure\n1. This scale dependence arises as follows: the dynamical gluon mass affects strongly the\nDP T\nbehaviour of the gluon-gluon subprocess cross section \u03c3\u0302gg\n(\u015d), which dominates at high\n\nenergy and determines the asymptotic behaviour of the pp and p\u0304p total cross section. Hence\nthe procedure consisting of global fits to diffractive pp and p\u0304p data in order to determine mg\nis well justified, and the value mg = 400+350\n\u2212100 MeV obtained in Ref. [15] via the DGM model\nis a suitable one.\nOur estimates for the survival probability of large rapidity gaps using a QCD based\neikonal model with a dynamical gluon mass are, within the errors, compatible with estimates\nobtained using other eikonal models. In particular, our estimates are close to the ones\nobtained by Khoze et al. using a two-channel model, and to the ones obtained by Block\nand Halzen using a similar QCD-inspired approach. Owing to the interval [300,750] MeV\ninferred from the optimal value of mg discussed above, there is room for smaller values of the\nsurvival factor in DGM model. For example, a mass scale mg \u223c 300 MeV gives a survival\n\nfactor h|S|2i \u223c 15.3 % at LHC, very close to the central value obtained via the KMR model.\nHowever, we call attention to the fact that all these estimates are model dependent,\n\ndespite their apparent agreement. For example, the h|S|2iKM R results for other values of\n2b and for central and single diffractive processes do not agree with ours [20]. The same is\nexpected in the h|S|2 iBH results for other choices of the mass scale m0 .\nIn summary, there is a strong dependence in the size of the survival probabilities and\nin their energy dependence on specific models for the rise of total hadronic cross section.\nMore specifically, the survival factor h|S|2 i depends on the dynamics of the whole diffractive\npart of the scattering matrix as well as the nature of the colour-singlet exchange which\n10\n\n\fgenerates the gap. From the experimental viewpoint, it is known that the survival factor\nh|S|2i in the case of Higgs production via W W \u2192 H fusion processes can be monitored by\nobserving the closely related central production of a Z boson with the same jet and rapidity\ngap configuration [32]. More recently, this idea has been developed further by considering\nthe decays of both Higgs and Z bosons into b\u0304b pairs [33]. This allows to gauge Higgs weak\nboson fusion production at the LHC and permits to observe a light Higgs boson via its\ndominant H \u2192 b\u0304b decay mode in addiction to the usually discussed \u03c4 \u03c4 and W W \u2217 channels.\nThis option would permit to reduce the theoretical uncertainty in the rate of Higgs central\nproduction events with rapidity gaps.\nThe success of the QCD-based eikonal model with a dynamical gluon mass in reproducing\ndiffractive scattering data, over a large energy range, shows that such a model provides a\nreliable estimate of the survival probability h|S|2i as a function of energy in the case of pp\n\nand p\u0304p channels. The study of the survival factor h|S|2i is interesting in its own right since\n\nthey enables us to increase our understanding of some features of hadronic interactions, and\nmay provide an useful tool to probe physics beyond the Standard Model.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank C.O.
