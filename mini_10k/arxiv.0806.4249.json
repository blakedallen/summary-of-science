Introduction\nNa3Cu2SbO6 has a honeycomb lattice of edgesharing CuO6 octahedra,1) but it is distorted due to the\nCu2+ Jahn-Teller effect. The valence of Cu atoms is\n+2 and the spin S is 1/2. For this quantum spins, the\nexistence of the excitation gap (spin gap) was found\nby the study of macroscopic quantities.2) Figure 1\nschematically shows the Cu2+ skeleton lattice viewed\nfrom the direction perpendicular to the ab-plane. The\nratio of the lattice parameter b to a is smaller than \u221a3.\nWe define the superexchange interactions between\ntwo Cu spins, J1, J1' and J2 as shown in Fig. 1, then,\nneglect J1', considering the rather large Jahn-Teller\ndistortion working on the Cu2+ spins in the x2-y2 orbit\n(with local coordinates),2) and obtain the alternating\nchain model along the b axis with J1 and J2. Actually,\nthe antiferromagnetic(AF)-ferromagnetic(F) alternating chain model was found, as reported in ref. 2, to\nsuccessfully describe the observed magnetic and\nthermal behaviors, where the gap energy \u2206G of ~90 K,\nand the F and AF exchange interactions JF and JAF of\n-209 K and 165 K were obtained, respectively, by using the Hamiltonian H = \u03a3i{J1S2i\u22c5S2i+1+J2S2i+1\u22c5S2i+2}.\nHowever, we could not distinguish which one of J1\nand J2 is F or AF. Similar studies on the spin gap\nphenomenon has also been carried out for\nNa2Cu2TeO6 by Xu et al.3)\n\nJ1 '\n\na\nJ1\n\nJ2\n\nb\nFig. 1 Schematic figure of Cu2+ honeycomb lattice of\nNa3Cu2SbO6 viewed from the direction perpendicular to the\nab-plane, where only the Cu sites are shown. The exchange\ninteractions J1, J1' and J2 are defined between the Cu2+ spins.\n\nDeakhshan et al.4) reported by their theoretical\nstudy that the AF-AF alternating chain model is\nappropriate for Na3Cu2SbO6. Contrary to their result,\nKoo and Whangbo5) have reported that the AF-F\nalternating chain model is appropriate to the\ndescription of the magnetic properties of the system\nbased on their band calculations.\nThe present neutron scattering study has been\ncarried out to determine the values of J1 and J2 by\nusing single crystals of Na3Cu2SbO6, and here we\npresent detailed data, which clearly show that the\nsystem has the AF-F alternating chains with\nferromagnetic J1.\n\n\f2. Experiments\nSingle crystals of Na3Cu2SbO6 were prepared from\nmixtures of CuO, Sb2O3 and Na2CO3 with a condition\nof slightly excess Na. They were ground and heated\nup rapidly to 1150  \u030aC in a crucible, and kept at the\ntemperature for 2 h, cooled to about 1000  \u030aC at a rate\nof \u223c2 K/h and furnace cooled to room temperature.\nThe neutron measurements were carried out on the\ntriplet-axis-spectrometer ISSP-PONTA at JRR-3 of\nJapan Atomic Energy Agency in Tokai. Three\ncrystals aligned within 0.7 \u00b0 were used, where the\ntypical volume of each crystal was about 60 mm3.\nThe 002 reflection of the pyrolytic graphite (PG) was\nused both for the monochromator and the analyzer. A\nPG filter after the sample was used to suppress the\nhigher order contaminations. Horizontal collimations\nwere effectively 40'-40'-80'-80'. The sample crystals\nwere oriented with the [100] and [010] axes in the\nscattering plane. The condition of the fixed final\nneutron energy Ef = 14.7 meV was adopted.\n\n(a)\n\n\u2206E = 9 meV, T = 10 K\n(2, k, 0)\n\nIntensity (counts /600 kmon.)\n\n100\n\n0\n\n(1.5, k, 0)\n100\n\n0\n\n(1, k, 0)\n\n100\n\n0\n\n3. Experimental Results and Discussion\nBecause the energy gap \u2206G of the singlet-triplet\nexcitation is, as described later, were found to be\nabout 9 meV, we collected the scattering intensities I\nat the transfer energy (\u2206E) of 9 meV to find the\npositions of the scattering vector (Q) corresponding\nto the minimum energy of the excitation. It was\ncarried out at 10 K by scanning k along (h, k, 0) for\nseveral fixed values of h and the results are shown in\nFig. 2(a). We can see, for h = 1, the intensity peaks of\nthe singlet-triplet excitation at the points k = 0.5, 2.5\nand 3.5 in the region of k < 4.0. For h = 1.5 and 2,\npeaks are found at the same k points as for h = 1. We\ndo not see a peak in the k-scans along (1, k, 0), (1.5, k,\n0) and (2, k, 0) at k = 1.0, and there is no peak in the\ndata taken by the h-scan along (h, 1, 0), either (not\nshown). These results indicate that the scattering\nintensities along (h, 1, 0) correspond to the background (BG). By considering this fact, the intrinsic\npart of the magnetic scattering intensities at (h, 2.5,\n0) were determined by subtracting the neutron counts\nat (h, 1, 0) from those at (h, 2.5, 0), and the result is\nshown in Fig. 2(b) together with the h-dependence\n(solid line) calculated by considering the form factor\nof the Cu 3d x2-y2 spins (with local coordinates) and\nthe one-dimensional nature of the spin chains along b.\nFrom the figure, the one-dimensionality is found to\ndescribe the observed h dependence well.\nFrom the data shown in Fig. 2(a), we have found\nthat the energy minima of the singlet-triplet\nexcitation are found on the streaks along (h, 0.5, 0),\n(h, 2.5, 0) and (h, 3.5, 0) in the reciprocal space.

Details are in the text.\n\ncorresponds to the spin correlation shown in Fig. 2(c),\nalthough the spins of the system do not have the\nstatic correlation. If the static correlation existed in\nthe chain, we had magnetic Bragg streaks along (h,\n0.5, 0), (h, 2.5, 0) and (h, 3.5, 0). Similar data can be\nfound in the data reported for the F-AF alternating\nspin chains of CuNb2O6,6) for example. From the\nresult, J1 and J2 are found to be F(J1<0) and AF(J2>0),\nrespectively.\nIn Fig. 3, the BG-subtracted intensities {I(Q, \u2206E)\n\u2212BG} of the magnetic excitation at Q = (1, 2.5, 0) are\nplotted against \u2206E at several fixed temperatures T,\nwhere BG is assumed to be independent of \u2206E and T.\n2\n\n\fobserved profiles have been fitted by the calculated\nones obtained after convoluting S(q, \u03c9) with the\nresolution function R(q\u2212Q, \u03c9\u2212\u2206E), and the results\nare shown in the figure by the solid lines. In the\nfittings, we have used the simple expression S(q, \u03c9) \u223c\n\u03c7(q)\u22c5{1\u2212exp(-\u0127\u03c9/kBT)}\u22121\u22c5{\u0393/[(\u03c9-\u03c9Q)2+\u03932] instead of\neq. (1), because \u0393 is much smaller than \u03c9q at this low\ntemperature. The dispersion curve or the k\ndependence of \u03c9q used in the calculation was\ndetermined self-consistently, and it is shown in Fig.\n5(a). We have also used an assumption that BG is\nlinear in \u2206E. The gap energy \u2206G is found to be ~ 8.9\nmeV. Figure 5(b) shows the scale factors \u03c7(Q), where\nthe form-factor-correction was made. In the figure,\nwe find an interesting characteristic of the excitation\nthat the peak is at the incommensurate Q point with k\n\u223c 2.4. In Fig. 5(c), \u0393 is plotted against k. Although it\nseems to exhibit slight k dependence, we do not\nknow what it indicates at this moment.\nTo find information on the physical parameters of\nthe present system, it is useful to compare the above\ndata with results of model calculations by Watanabe\nand Yokoyama7) reported for alternating spin chains.\nFor example, the dispersion curve in Fig. 5(a) can be\nwell explained by choosing the parameters JAF ~ 13.9\nmeV and JF/JAF ~ -0.9, which should be compared\nwith values of JAF ~ 14.2 meV and JF/JAF ~ -1.27,\nobtained previously from the macroscopic measurements.2) The \u2206G value of 8.9 meV should also be\ncompared with the previous value of ~ 7.8 meV. The\nexchange parameters obtained here are qualitatively\ndifferent from the prediction of ref. 4 that both J1 and\n\nWe can see that the intensity-\u2206E curve in the low\nenergy region begins to become concave with\ndecreasing T at around T0, where the magnetic\nsusceptibility has a maximum value.\nIn the analyses of the data in Fig. 3, we express the\nmagnetic scattering intensity S(q, \u03c9) as\nS(q, \u03c9) \u223c \u03c7(q)\u22c5\u0393\u03c9\u22c5{1\u2212exp(-\u0127\u03c9/kBT)}\u22121\n\u22c5{1/[(\u03c9-\u03c9q)2+\u03932]+1/[(\u03c9+\u03c9q)2+\u03932]},\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u0393 and \u03c9q are the half width at half maximum\nand energy of the triplet excitation with the wave\nvector q, respectively. Here, \u03c9q can be approximated\nto be q independent within the ellipsoid of the q\nresolution centered at Q = (1, 2.5, 0) corresponding\nto the dispersion bottom. After convoluting the\ncalculated S(q, \u03c9) with the resolution function R(q\u2212Q,\n\u03c9\u2212\u2206E), S(Q, \u2206E) has been obtained and fitted to the\ndata shown in Fig. 3, and the results are presented by\nthe solid lines.\nThe values of \u0393 and \u03c9Q (or the value of \u2206G)\nobtained in the above analyses are plotted against T\nin the upper and lower insets of Fig. 3, respectively.\nFrom these figures, we find that \u2206G does not decrease\nwith increasing T, and the concave structure observed\nin Fig. 3 can be understood as the result of the\ndecrease of \u0393 with decreasing \u03a4, and the apparent\ngap grows as T approaches zero.\nTo study the dispersion relation of the excitations\nat low temperature, the scattering profiles were\nmeasured at 10 K by scanning \u2206E at (1, 2.5, 0) and at\nseveral points of (1.5, k, 0) in the region of 2.4 \u2265 k >\n2, and their examples are shown in Fig. 4.

Conclusions\nMagnetic excitation spectra of the spins of\nNa3Cu2SbO6 have been measured by neutron inelastic scattering. The data show that the spin system can\nbe well understood by the one-dimensional spin\nchains formed of Cu2+ ions on a lattice of the\nalternation of the shorter- and longer-spacings along\nthe b axis. The exchange interaction between the\nneighboring spins with the shorter distance (J1) is\nfound to be ferromagnetic and that with the longer\nspacing (J2) is antiferromagnetic. The observed gap\n\u2206G is 8.9 meV and the antiferromagnetic- and ferromagnetic-interactions have been found to be 13.9 and\n-12.5 meV, respectively. These values are basically\nconsistent with those we reported previously on the\nbasis of macroscopic measurements. The magnetic\nscattering intensity was found to have a peak at the\nincommensurate positions in the reciprocal space,\nwhich can also be understood by using the calculated\nresults by Watanabe and Yokoyama.7)\n20\n\nReferences\n1) O.
