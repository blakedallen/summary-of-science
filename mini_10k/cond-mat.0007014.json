In the process where two independent many-particle\nsystems suddenly touch with each other, it is shown that the lowest energy after\nthe interaction can possibly be smaller than that before the interaction and then\nthe entropy burst can occur.\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nE-mail: kobayash@a.tsukuba-tech.ac.jp\nE-mail: shimbori@het.ph.tsukuba.ac.jp\n\n\fIn the previous paper [1] it has been shown that even-dimensional parabolic potential barriers such as V (y, z) = \u2212m\u03b3 2 (y 2 + z 2 )/2 have infinitely degenerate stationarystates with the zero real energy eigenvalue, which are described by stationary flows\nround the center of the potential. This result is really surprising, because in general\nthe parabolic potential barriers have been considered as the model for unstable states [27]. In fact it is shown that one has only unstable states like resonances in one-dimensional\nparabolic potential barriers like V (x) = \u2212m\u03b3 2 x2 /2, which are represented by the solutions of the conjugate space of Gel'fand triplet [8] with imaginary energy eigenvalues\n\u2213i(n + 1/2)~\u03b3 (n = 0, 1, 2, * * * ) [2-7]. The existence of such stationary states in evendimensional is not only surprising fact but also suggests the existence of the stable manybody systems constructed from the stationary states. Following this line of consideration,\nwe have shown that there exist stable many-body systems composed of the stationary flows\nin statistical mechanics including all states derived in the Gel'fand triplet formalism [9].\nAn important difference appears in the fact that in the new statistical mechanics a new\nfreedom arises from that of the imaginary part of energy eigenvalues which is only allowed\nin the extended spaces of the Gel'fand triplet. Actually the thermodynamical probability\nW is expressed by the product of the thermodynamical probability W R with respect to\nthe real part of the energy and that W I with respect to the imaginary part of the energy\nsuch that W = W R W I . Therefore the entropy which is defined by S = kB log W becomes\nthe sum of the usual Boltzmann entropy S R = kB log W R induced from the freedom of\nthe real part of the energy eigenvalues and a new one S I = kB log W I originating from\nthat of the imaginary part as S = S R + S I . (In details, see ref. 9.) It is natural to expect\nthat there exists some kind of entropy transfer between the two entropies S R and S I .\nIn this paper we shall study the entropy transfer in an explicit example by using a\nsimple model which is described by one-dimensional harmonic oscillator (HO) + twodimensional isotropic parabolic potential barrier (PPB) such as\n1\n1\nV (x, y, z) = m\u03c9 2 x2 \u2212 m\u03b3 2 (y 2 + z 2 ),\n2\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere m is the mass of particle. Note that the HO part is necessary for confirming the\nentropy transfer, because the PPB cannot have any freedom of the real energy eigenvalues,\nthat is, the real energy eigenvalue is fixed at 0. The energy eigenvalues of the potential\n(1) are given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n~\u03c9 \u2213 i(ny \u2212 nz )~\u03b3\n(2)\nEnx ny nz = nx +\n2\nfor the solutions involving the stationary states, where the first and the second terms,\nrespectively, denote the contributions from the HO and the PPB and nx , ny , nz =\n0, 1, 2, * * * . The stationary states appear for ny = nz , of which relation washes out the\nimaginary part from the eigenvalues [1]. It is now transparent that the infinite degeneracy\nof the all states having the energy eigenvalues of (2) originates from the freedom of\nthe imaginary eigenvalues. Note that all stationary states are described by stationary\n1\n\n\fflows round the center of the potential [1]. Actually the difference between the infinitely\ndegenerate states is represented by the difference of the stationary flows. Note that\ncomplex velocity potentials W which are well-known in hydrodynamics can be introduced\nand W = \u00b1\u03b3(y + iz)2 /2 is obtained for the first few stationary eigenstates in the twodimensional PPB V (y, z) = \u2212m\u03b3 2 (y 2 + z 2 )/2 [1, 10].\nLet us consider a system being in a thermal equilibrium, which is composed of N1\nparticles trapped by the potential\n\u0015\nN1 \u0014\nX\n1\n1\n2 2\n2 2\n2\nV1 =\nm\u03c9 xi \u2212 m\u03b3 (yi + zi ) .\n(3)\n2\n2\ni=1\nThe energy of the stationary ground state is uniquely determined by\n\n1\n(4)\nE1 = N1 ~\u03c9.\n2\nThis state, of course, has no degeneracy arising from the HO and then the Boltzmann\nentropy S R = 0. It, however, has a diverging entropy with respect to the new entropy S I ,\nsince the infinite degeneracy arises from the PPB. It is noted here that the stable manybody systems in the PPB are described as the nets of stationary circular-flows, the two\njoints of which are not connected by the wavefunctions of the stationary eigenstates but\nthey are connected by the stationary flows of the PPB [9]. This fact means that one can\ndirectly look in the net-structure (texture) composed of the stationary flows, because the\nflows are basically observable in quantum mechanics. It is, therefore, understood that the\nsystems have some kind of classical property that the components inside of the systems\nare observable. Thus one sees that the appearance of the entropy S I originates from this\nsemiclassical property of the stable many-body systems in the even-dimensional PPB.\nNow let us study a thermal process which is described by the mixing of two independent\nmany-particle systems written by the potential given in (3). We consider the following\nsituation; the two independent systems are suddenly put on their interactive region, where\none has the center at x = a and y = z = b and the other at x = \u2212a and y = z = \u2212b, and\nthen the mixing starts and they finally make a new stable system in a thermal equilibrium.\nBefore the mixing the ground-state energy is uniquely determined by\n1\nEbef = (N1 + N2 )~\u03c9,\n(5)\n2\nwhere N1 and N2 are, respectively, the number of the constituent particles of the system\none and that of the other. After the mixing the two potentials being at the two centers\nhave the effects on the all constituent particles and then the potential is written by\nN \u001a\nX\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\nVT =\nm\u03c9 2 (xi \u2212 a)2 + (xi + a)2\n2\ni=1\n\u001b\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n,\n(6)\n\u2212 m\u03b3 (yi \u2212 b) + (zi \u2212 b) + (yi + b) + (zi + b)\n2\n2\n\n\fwhere N = N1 + N2 . This potential is rewritten as\nN\nX\n\u0002\n\u0003\nVT =\nm\u03c9 2 x2i \u2212 m\u03b3 2 (yi2 + zi2 ) + Nm(\u03c9 2 a2 \u2212 2\u03b3 2 b2 ).\n\n(7)\n\ni=1\n\nThe differences between the potentials before and after the mixing appear in the following\ntwo points: One is the fact that the potential curvatures after the mixing become twice as\nlarge as those before the mixing and the other is the appearance of a real constant term\nNm(\u03c9 2 a2 \u2212 2\u03b3 2 b2 ). These effects can be seen in the ground-state energy such that\n1\nEaft = \u221a N~\u03c9 + Nm(\u03c9 2 a2 \u2212 2\u03b3 2 b2 ).\n2\n\n(8)\n\nThe difference between the ground-state energies before and after the mixing is evaluated\nas\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\nN~\u03c9 + Nm(\u03c9 2 a2 \u2212 2\u03b3 2 b2 ),\n(9)\n\u2206E0 = \u221a \u2212\n2 2\nwhere \u2206E0 = Eaft \u2212 Ebef . The difference can be negative, even if the first term of the\ndifference is definitely positive. Namely, when the relation\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n\u221a \u2212\n~\u03c9 + m\u03c9 2 a2 < 2m\u03b3 2 b2\n(10)\n2 2\nis satisfied, the difference become negative. It should be noted that the negative contribution originates only from the two-dimensional PPB. One easily see that the difference\nalways becomes positve, if the potential is described only by HO. The existence of the\nPPB is essential to derive the negative difference. The change of the potentials producing\nreal energy eigenvalues before and after the mixing are illustrated in fig. 1. This real and\nnegative energy \u2206E0 must be absorbed in the energy of the HO, because the PPB can\nonly have the freedom of pure imaginary eigenvalues. This means that the ground-state\nenergy before the mixing becomes an excited-state energy after the mixing. The excitation energy is evaluated by Eexc = |\u2206E0 |. Note here that Eexc is generally a macroscopic\norder because it is proportional to the total particle number N. Thus the system have\nthe freedom arising from the real energy, which is given by the Boltzmann entropy\nS R = kB log W R (Eexc ),\n\n(11)\n\nwhere\n\n(M + N \u2212 1)!\nM!(N \u2212 1)!\nand M stands for the excitation number of the HO\n\u221a after the mixing, which is defined\nby the maximum integer being smaller than Eexc / 2~\u03c9. It is well-known that one can\nexpress the entropy as\nW R (Eexc ) =\n\nS R = kB [(M + N) log(M + N) \u2212 M log M \u2212 N log N] ,\n3\n\n(12)\n\n\fV (x)\n\u273b\n\n1\nVbef (x) = m\u03c9 2 (x + a)2\n2\n\n1\nVbef (x) = m\u03c9 2 (x \u2212 a)2\n2\n\nEbef\nN\n\u273b\n\n\u2212a\n\n0\n\n|\u2206E0 |\nN\n\nEaft\nN\n\n\u2732\n\na\n\nx\n\n\u2744\n\nVaft (x) = m\u03c9 2 x2 \u2212 m(2\u03b3 2 b2 \u2212 \u03c9 2 a2 )\n\u2212m(2\u03b3 2 b2 \u2212 \u03c9 2 a2 )\n\nFig. 1: Potentials producing real energy eigenvalues for one constituent.\n\n4\n\n\fwhere M, N \u226b 1 are postulated.

Namely, the\nmixing of two systems changes the ground state and then the energy of the ground state\nafter the mixing can be much smaller than that before the mixing. The essential point of\nthis process is the existence of stable states in the repulsive potentials like the PPB [1].\nPPB's can possibly be good approximations to repulsive forces which are very week at\nthe center of the force as same as the fact that HO's are known as good approximations\nto attractive forces being very week at the center. We can, therefore, expect that entropy\nproductions will occur in real thermodynamical processes. One may understand that the\nentropy production is caused by the entropy transfer between S R and S I , though one\ncannot directly show it in the present model because the entropies S I 's in the initial and\nthe final states are infinity.\n\u221a\nIt will happen in realistic processes that the number Eexc / 2~\u03c9(\u2265 M) is not integer.\nIn such processes some part of energy must be emitted from the systems to make a stable\nsystem after the mixing. Sometimes the most of the energy Eexc will possibly be emitted\nand the system goes to the fatal ground state, since the change of the curvature of the\nPPB makes all stationary states in the initial state unstable in the final state. In such\ncases the observers will see the burst of energy, which will be seen as the burst of entropy\nalso. This fact indicates that one can make macroscopic energy bursts, provided that one\ncan prepare the thermally stable systems composed of stationary flows in PPB's. That\nis to say, there is a possibility of producing energies in purely thermal processes without\nany nuclear fusions at ordinary temperatures. Finally we would also like to note that it\nwill be a very interesting trial to describe the birth of the Universe in the present scheme.\n\n5\n\n\fReferences\n[1] T. Shimbori and T.
