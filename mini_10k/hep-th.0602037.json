In particular, it is shown that in the large Nc limit and near the\nmaximum hadronic temperature, TH , the energy density and pressure of the metastable phase scale\nas E \u223c (TH \u2212 T )\u2212(D\u22a5 \u22126)/2 (for D\u22a5 < 6) and P \u223c (TH \u2212 T )\u2212(D\u22a5 \u22124)/2 (for D\u22a5 < 4) where D\u22a5 is\nthe effective number of transverse dimensions of the string theory. It is shown, however, that for\nthe thermodynamic quantities of interest the limits T \u2192 TH and Nc \u2192 \u221e do not commute. The\nprospect of extracting D\u22a5 via lattice simulations of the metastable hadronic phase at moderately\nlarge Nc is discussed.\n\nThe modern incarnation of string theory as a fundamental description of nature arose Phoenix-like out of\nthe ashes of a failed attempt to describe strong interaction dynamics in terms of basic string degrees of freedom.\nWith the advent of QCD, it rapidly became clear that a\nstring model was not the correct way to describe fully the\ntheory of strong interactions. However, string models did\nhave many successes in describing important theoretical\nand phenomenological features of hadronic physics. On\nthe phenomenological side, string models describe in a\nsimple and natural way the linearly rising Regge trajectories seen in the data[1]. They also give rise to a spectrum\nof hadrons which grow exponentially[1] which is also seen\nin the data[2, 3]. On the theory side such models naturally have linear confinement. Intuitively this picture\nmakes sense if color sources form flux tubes-as they appear to on the lattice. Accordingly from the early days\nof QCD on, there has been a widespread belief that QCD\nin some sense becomes qualitatively equivalent to an effective string theory, at least in a certain domain. Such\nan effective theory can be denoted as a\"QCD string\".\nThis paper relates the nature of the QCD string theory to its thermodynamics at large Nc . In the large Nc\nlimit QCD becomes a pure glue theory and has a first\norder phase transition between its hadronic and deconfined phases[4]. The purpose of this paper is to show\nthat at large Nc the thermodynamics of the metastable\nhadron phase above this transition is determined by the\nnature of the string theory. In the first place regardless\nof the type of string theory there is a maximum temperature TH above which the metastable hadronic phase cannot be maintained. Secondly, the power law behavior of\nthe energy density and the free energy of the metastable\nhadronic phase is completely determined by the effective\nnumber of transverse dimensions of the QCD string. This\nis significant because lattice studies of the metastable\nphase of pure glue theory for relatively large Nc (up to\nNc = 12) are now possible[5].\nThe qualitative successes of the string picture can only\nbe rigorously correct quantitatively in the large Nc limit.\nFor example, the linear Regge behavior and the exponentially growing density of hadrons both depend on\n\nthe identification of hadron masses. However, the excited hadrons are resonances and thus do not have welldefined masses. Fortunately, as Nc \u2192 \u221e, the width of\nglueballs and mesons goes to zero (as Nc\u22122 and Nc\u22121 ,\nrespectively)[6], the ambiguity in the value of the mass\nvanishes, and the string theory prediction becomes well\ndefined. Similarly, linear confinement only can occur in\nQCD if for some reason flux tubes are unable to break. In\nthe large Nc limit of QCD, a simple diagrammatic argument shows that the formation of each quark-antiquark\npair is suppressed by a power of 1/Nc and thus at large\nNc , flux tubes do not break[6]. Therefore, the simple\nconsequences ascribed to a QCD string theory can only\naccurately reflect the underlying theory in the large Nc\nlimit.\nSimilarly, one expects a string-like description to be\nincreasingly more accurate as the excitation energy increases. If the QCD string theory is simulating a flux\ntube, then one expects the dynamics of the tube moving\ncollectively in the manner of a string to arise when the\ncharacteristic length of the flux tube is much longer than\nthe typical width of the tube. Such excitations have large\nmasses.\nFor simplicity, the present analysis will be restricted\nto pure gauge theory. This restriction is motivated both\nby the focus on the large Nc where quark loop effects\nare suppressed by factors of 1/Nc , and by the desire to\ncompare the analysis with lattice simulations which for\nrelative large Nc have only been done for pure glue[5].\nThe inclusion of quark loops leads to possible technical\ncomplications in the analysis and will be neglected here\nin the interest of clarity.\nConsider the behavior of large Nc QCD at zero chemical potential in the hadronic phase. As argued in ref. [7]\nsuch a system is well described by a non-interacting gas\nof hadrons (which for our pure glue system means glueballs). The hadrons are non-interacting since by standard\nNc counting agruments[6] glueball-glueball interactions\nscale with Nc according to\nVgg \u223c 1/Nc2 .\n\n(1)\n\nThis scaling implies that if the number densities of the\nhadrons are of order Nc0 , then the energy is dominated by\n\n\f2\nthe mass of the hadrons also of order Nc0 and interactions\nmay be neglected.\nA framework for describing such a non-interacting gas\nof hadrons has been developed for phenomenological reasons [8] and will be used here. Consider a gas of noninteracting glueballs where the k th species of glueball has\nmass mk and spin Jk . It is straightforward to see that\nthat the energy density \u01ebk and pressure associated with\neach spin state of the boson is given by\np\nZ\np 2 + m2\nd3 p\n\u221a 2 2 k\n\u01eb(mk , T ) =\n3\n(2\u03c0) e p +mk /T \u2212 1\n5/2\n\nT 3/2 mk e\u2212mk /T\n= mk n k ,\n(2\u03c0)3/2\n\u0012 2 2\u0013 X\n\u221e\n\u0010 nm \u0011\nmk T\nk\nK\nP (mk , T ) =\n2\n2\n2\u03c0\nT\nn=1\n\u2192\n\nm3/2 T 5/2\n\u2192 3/2 3/2 e\u2212m/T\n2 \u03c0\n\n(2)\n\nwhere K2 is a modified Bessel function and the arrows indicate asymptotic behavior of these functions as\nm/T \u2192 P\n\u221e. The spectral density of hadrons is defined as\n\u03c1(m) \u2261 k (2Jk + 1) \u03b4(m \u2212 mk ). The asymptotic contribution to energy density and the pressure in the hadronic\nphase are given by\nZ \u221e\nE(T ) =\ndm \u03c1(m)\u01eb(m, T ) + O(1/Nc2 )\n\ndynamics is well described in terms of weakly interacting quarks and gluons is of order Nc0 . Thus, there are\ntwo temperature domains at order Nc0 : a low temperature hadronic one with energy densities of order Nc0 and\na quark-gluon phase with energy densities of order Nc2 .\nFor infinite Nc such a situation is only possible if there\nis a discontinuity: below some Tc , E/Nc2 = 0 while above\nTc E/Nc2 is nonzero. In fact, for pure glue theories we\nknow from lattice studies that this transition is first order. Moreover, the latent heat of the transition appears\nto scale numerically with Nc2 as expected from this simple\nanalysis[5].\nSuppose that the high-lying spectrum of hadrons in\nlarge Nc QCD is, in fact, describable as a hadronic string.\nThe behavior of the density of hadronic states is known\nfor asymptotically large values of M [9] and is given by\n\u03c1(m) \u2192 \u03c1asy (m) = A (m/TH )\u22122B em/TH\n\n(4)\n\nwhere A, TH and B are parameters which are independent of Nc . The value of the TH depends on the numerical\nvalue of the string tension \u03c3. It also depends on the type\nof string theory and, in particular, the world sheet cen2\ntral charge, c: TH\n= 3\u03c3\n\u03c0c . The key to the present analysis\nis the parameter B is universal[9] (i.e., independent of\nthe type of string theory) and depends only on, D\u22a5 ;\nB = (D\u22a5 + 3)/4 .\n\n(5)\n\n0\n\n(3)\nwhere the O(1/Nc2 ) correction arises from the interaction\nenergy between the glueballs. The specific heat can be\nobtained by differentiating the energy density with respect to the temperature. Generically both the energy\ndensity and the hadron number density are of order Nc0 .\nAt low temperatures and large Nc , the energy density is\ndominated by the mass of the hadrons rather than their\ninteraction energy; QCD can then be described increasingly accurately in terms of non-interacting hadrons as\nNc increases.\nHowever, at very high temperatures QCD is described\nincreasingly accurately as a gas of weakly interacting\nquarks and gluons. At large Nc this is dominated by\nthe gluons and the energy density scales as Nc2 . Moreover, from the behavior of the \u03b2 function it is apparent\nthat the characteristic temperature at which the thermo-\n\nEasy\n\n7/2\n\n= (2\u03c0)\u22123/2 A T (9\u2212D\u22a5 )/2 TH\n\n\u00d7\n\nThe parameter TH is the well-known Hagedorn temperature associated with the spectrum[10].\nIn the\nhadronic gas model, the energy density in Eq. (3) diverges\nfor any T > TH . With the advent of QCD it became\napparent that the Hagedorn temperature was the upper\nbound for hadron matter[11]; the system is necessarily in\na deconfined phase above TH . As we now know, large Nc\nQCD enters a deconfined phase before TH is reached[4].\nHowever, TH presumably represents an upper bound for\nthe temperature of a metastable hadronic phase[5].\nIt was realized long ago that the power law behavior\nof thermodynamic quantities in the neighborhood of TH\nare determined by the power law of the prefactor in the\nHagedorn expression; that is, by the coefficient B[12].\nEvaluating the integrals for the asymptotic contributions\nto the energy density and pressure using the Hagedorn\nspectrum obtained from QCD strings yields:\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 (TH \u2212 T )(D\u22a5 \u22126)/2 \u0393\n\uf8f3\n\n6\u2212D\u22a5\n2\n\n\u2212 log ((TH \u2212 T )/TH ))\n\n\u0001\n\nif D\u22a5 < 6\nif D\u22a5 = 6\n\n\f3\n\nPasy =\n\n5/2\n(2\u03c0)\u22123/2 A T (9\u2212D\u22a5 )/2 TH\n\n\u00d7\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 (TH \u2212 T )(D\u22a5 \u22124)/2 \u0393\n\uf8f3\n\nSince the asymptotic contributions to E and P diverge\nin the neighborhood of TH , they will dominate the full\nexpressions which in turn will diverge in the same manner. The nonanalytic behavior of the energy density in\nthe vicinity of TH immediately implies nonanalyticity for\nthe specific heat. Quite generally one sees that\n\u03b1 = 4 \u2212 D\u22a5 /2 ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is analogous to the usual critical exponent for\nthe specific heat (cv \u223c (TH \u2212 T )\u03b1 ).\nSuppose, that the QCD string has D\u22a5 \u2264 6. The thermodynamic behavior of such a system is qualitatively\nquite different from what one sees in typical statistical mechanics models-at least at large Nc . For typical\nmodels the metastable phase can have a maximum temperature. Such a maximum temperature is a spinodal\npoint-the point at which local fluctuations destabilize\nthe phase. The energy density remains finite as the spinodal point is approached-although the specific heat will\ndiverge. In this sense, a spinodal point behaves essentially as a second phase order transition. If the QCD\nstring has D\u22a5 \u2264 6, there is also a maximum temperature for the metastable phase, namely, TH , as there is\nwith familiar statistical mechanical models. However, in\nsharp contrast to the typical spinodal point, the energy\ndensity of the QCD string theory diverges as TH is approached; for the case of D\u22a5 = 2 one sees from Eq. (6)\nthat the power law behavior for the energy density of\nthe metastable hadronic phase goes as E \u223c (TH \u2212 T )\u22122 .\nThis inability to reach the maximum temperature in the\nhadronic phase due to its energetic inaccessibility is the\nmodern incarnation of Hagedorn's old idea (although now\nrelegated to a metastable phase and large Nc ) and occurs for D\u22a5 \u2264 6. The critical exponent \u03b1 encodes the\ndifference between typical statistical systems for which\nthe finiteness of the energy at the transition requires\n0 \u2264 \u03b1 < 1 and the present case for which \u03b1 is greater\nthan unity (provided D\u22a5 < 6). For example in the simple\nNambu-Goto string (D\u22a5 = 2) \u03b1 = 3 .\nLattice simulations showing clear evidence of the energy density having such a power law divergent behavior\nfor the energy density at large Nc would provide strong\nnumerical support for the notion of the QCD string.\nSimilarly a numerical determination that \u03b1 = 3 for the\nmetastable phase would go a long way toward establishing that the effective QCD string has D\u22a5 = 2 as in the\nNambu-Goto string.\nPerhaps more exciting is the possibility that numerical evidence could show that \u03b1 6= 3 near TH indicating\nthe effective transverse dimension of the QCD string is\n\n4\u2212D\u22a5\n2\n\n\u2212 log ((TH \u2212 T )/TH ))\n\n\u0001\n\nif D\u22a5 < 4\n.\n\n(6)\n\nif D\u22a5 = 4\n\ndifferent from two. The effective transverse dimension\nof the QCD string could, in principle, be different from\nthe number of transverse space-time dimensions since the\neffective number of transverse dimensions characterizes\nthe number of degrees of freedom of the string. One can\nimagine scenarios in which the dynamics gives a larger\nnumber of degrees of freedom than in the simplest string\npicture. As a practical matter, properties of the QCD\nstring can be extracted from the behavior of the system\nnear the endpoint of the metastable phase only if D\u22a5 \u2264 6.\nFor D\u22a5 > 6, the energy density does not diverge at TH\nand it becomes difficult to disentangle the Hagedorn behavior of string theory from the critical behavior seen in\nmany statistical mechanical systems.\nAn important caveat is in order. The preceding analysis makes important use of the large Nc limit. One\nmight hope that the qualitative behavior of power law\ndivergence encoded in Eq (6) remains valid at large but\nfinite Nc (perhaps with the powers altered by 1/Nc corrections). Unfortunately, for D\u22a5 \u2264 4 simple thermodynamics indicates that this cannot be the case. The pressure is the negative of the free energy density. By definition in a metastable phase there exists another phase\nwith lower free energy (and thus higher pressure). In this\ncase it is the deconfined phase (with pressure \u223c Nc2 ).\nThus, the expression given for the pressure in Eq. (6)\nbreaks down when T gets sufficiently close to TH so that\npressures are of order Nc2 . This breakdown can be understood physically-the analysis is based on negligible\ninteractions between glueballs. However, as T \u2192 TH\nthe glueball density diverges. It is easy to show that the\nnumber density of glueballs scales in the same way as the\npressure (at large Nc ) and thus one expects that when\nthe pressures reach order Nc2 so do the number densities;\nEq. (1) then implies that the interaction energy does as\nwell. Thus at that point the interaction energy is comparable to the mass energy and analysis breaks down.\nIt is clear that the temperature regime in which the\nexpressions in Eq. (6) dominate, the energy and the\npressure is limited. For low temperatures, the asymptotic form does not dominate, while very close to Tc\nhadron-hadron interactions invalidate the analysis (provided D\u22a5 \u2264 4). Evidently the domain of validity is\n\uf8f1\n\u2212 4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 c2 Nc 4\u2212D\u22a5 if D\u22a5 < 4\n(8)\nc1 TH \u226a TH \u2212T \u226a TH \u00d7\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u2212c2 Nc2\ne\nif D\u22a5 = 4\nwhere c1 and c2 are constants of order Nc0 . Thus for the\nsimple scalar string with D\u22a5 = 2, the range of validity\nc1 TH \u226a TH \u2212 T \u226a TH /Nc2 .\n\n\f4\nNote that as Nc \u2192 \u221e the upper end of the region of\nvalidity approaches TH . However, for any finite value of\nNc the expression ultimately must break down as T approaches TH . Thus the critical exponents for the infinite\nNc theory will differ substantially from the critical exponents for large but finite Nc : the limit of the critical exponent as NC \u2192 \u221e will not equal the critical exponent for\ninfinite Nc . Recall the critical exponent associated with\nsome quantity f (T ) that diverge at\n\u0010 the critical point \u0011is\n\n(T ))\ndefined as a limit: \u03b3f \u2261 limT \u2192Tc (Tc \u2212 T ) d log(f\n.\ndT\nHowever, for the quantities of interest here the limits\nNc \u2192 \u221e and T \u2192 TH are not uniform.\nThe nonuniformity of limits means that in extracting\nthe power law behavior to learn about hadronic strings,\none considers the Nc \u2192 \u221e limit before the T \u2192 TH limit.\nCare must be taken in extracting the power law behavior\nof the energy density that one is working in the regime\nof validity of Eq. (6), i.e., for temperatures not too close\nto TH . Since in practice it is very difficult numerically\nto study a metastable phase very near its endpoint, it\nmay not be too difficult to do this provided Nc is large\nenough.\nThe study of Nc scaling behavior makes manifest the\nfact the range of validity of Eq. (6) is limited at the top\nend. This helps resolve a very old problem with Hagedorn's original idea of a limiting temperature. The issue\nof whether hadron-hadron interactions could fundamentally alter the thermodynamics was recognized as important very early by Huang and Weinberg[12]. However, at\nthe time there were no techniques to study the issue in\na controlled manner. In practice it only could be handled in an ad hoc fashion by neglecting the interactions\nunder the assumption that such interactions did not fundamentally alter the physical density of states. The Nc\nscaling arguments for the pressure show that this is not\nvalid for the real world of Nc = 3 or, indeed, for any\nfinite Nc -there will necessarily be a regime in which the\nhadron-hadron interactions must cause the growth in the\npressure to saturate as T approaches TH while the thermodynamics of a non-interacting gas of hadrons with a\nHagedorn spectrum will have a diverging pressure.\nThe preceding analysis provides no real insight into\nthe behavior of the system at finite (but large) Nc in\nthe immediate vicinity of TH . A highly plausible scenario is that there still is a maximum hadronic temperature at a spinodal point Tc which is very close to TH :\n((TH \u2212 Tc )/TH ) \u223c Nc2 . As Tc is approached glueballglueball interactions become strong and this drives an\ninstability leading to the existence of a spinodal point.\nAs was argued earlier, for the case of D\u22a5 \u2264 4 the breakdown in the hadron gas analysis occurs at temperatures\nwhere the energy of glueball-glueball interactions become\ncomparable to the energies of the free particles; at this\npoint, the dynamics changes qualitatively. Thus, when\npressure of order Nc2 are reached, nothing protects the\n\nsystem from developing an instability.\nThe relationship of the nature of the QCD string thermodynamics of the metastable phase of large Nc pure\nYang-Mills theory would be of comparatively little importance if there were no independent way to study this\nthermodynamics. However, lattice simulations of the\nmetastable phase provide the possibility of direct calculations of the thermodynamics from QCD. Simulations\nof the metastable phase at rather large Nc have already\nbeen done[5]. These studies were aimed at identifying\nthe maximum hadronic temperature (identified as the\nHagedorn temperature) which was done by extrapolating calculated values of the string tension down to the\npoint at which it vanishes. If similar calculations were\ndone for thermodynamic quantities such as the pressure,\nthe energy density or the specific heat, it may be possible\nto get ab initio evidence of the nature of the QCD string.\nNote added after publication. After this paper was\npublished, the author became aware of an important\nearly paper by Charles Thorn on the subject of the QCD\nphase transition at large Nc and its relation to the Hagedorn spectrum[13]. Reference [13] concludes among other\nthings that QCD must have a phase transition at infinite Nc and that the Hagedorn temperature is bounded\nfrom below by the critical temperature for the transition. Given the pioneering nature of this paper, and the\nfact that it is not as widely known as it should be, it is\nimportant to cite it here.\nThe author is grateful to S. Nussinov for useful comments.
