Introduction\nSeveral statistical analyses performed on subduction zones have indicated\nthat a direct correlation between the slab dip and the age of the oceanic lithosphere does not exist (e.g., Jarrard, 1986) and that other parameters may\nhave a more significant impact on slab dip variations, including: (1) the absolute motion of the overriding plate (Lallemand et al., 2005; Heuret et al.,\n2007); (2) the subduction rate (Cruciani et al., 2005; Lallemand et al., 2005);\n(3) the nature of the overriding plate (oceanic or continental) (Lallemand\net al., 2005); (4) the slab width (Schellart et al., 2007; Guillaume et al.,\n2009). Nevertheless, although the mutual interaction between these parameters controls the slab dip variations, the low cross-correlation coefficients obtained suggest that other parameters may have relevant roles (Cruciani et al.,\n2005; Lallemand et al., 2005). In light of this, some analogue and numerical\nmodels were performed to investigate the influence of other causes of subduction geometry variation, such as: (5) the physical parameters of the slab\n(Royden and Husson, 2006); (6) the back-arc stress variation (Heuret et al.,\n2007; Clark et al., 2008); (7) the slab interaction with the upper-lower mantle boundary in a long-term subduction (Christensen, 1996; Olbertz et al.,\n1997; Guillaume et al., 2009); (8) the trenchward motion (Espurt et al.,\n2008). At present, no analysis has been performed to investigate the role\nof the thermal state of the overriding plate on the slab dip. To contribute\nto this subject, we used a 2-D finite element numerical model to develop a\npreliminary quantitative analysis of the impact of the thermal state of an\nocean-continent convergent system. This kind of analysis could be very difficult if based solely on natural data. A comparison between the results of\nnumerical modeling and the data obtained from natural systems allows the\nevaluation of the robustness and fidelity of the model. A convergence rate\nof 3 cm/a was chosen for the simulations. The primary motivation of this\nchoice is that the present study is part of a wider analysis devoted to unravel\nthe pre-collisional evolution of the Alpine belt. Within this geodynamic context 3 cm/a reveals the most appropriate subduction rate, as suggested by\nboth geological evidences (Agard et al., 2009) and parametric analysis (Roda\net al., 2010). On the other hand, while the effects induced by a variation of\nthe subduction rate on the slab dip have been already widely investigated\n(e.g., Cruciani et al., 2005; Lallemand et al., 2005; Roda et al., 2010), the\ngoal of the present work is to enlighten the effects of a factor not yet taken\ninto account, namely, the thermal state of the overriding plate.\n2\n\n\f2. Model Setup\nWe used the same approach as in Roda et al. (2010). The equation of\ncontinuity\n\u2212\n\u2207*\u2192\nv =0\n(1)\nmomentum conservation\n\n\u2202p\n\u2202\u03c4ij\n\u2212\n=\n\u2212 \u03c1\u2192\ng\n\u2202xj\n\u2202xi\n\nand energy conservation\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202T \u2192\n\u2212\n\u03c1c\n+ v * \u2207T = \u2212\u2207 * (\u2212K\u2207T ) + \u03c1H\n\u2202t\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nwere solved by means of a finite element method within a 2-D rectangle\n\u2212\ndomain (Fig. 1). In the equations \u03c1 is the density, \u2192\nv the velocity, p the\n\u2192\n\u2212\npressure, g the gravity acceleration, \u03c4ij the deviatoric stress tensor, c the\nthermal capacity at constant pressure, T the temperature, K the thermal\nconductivity and H the heat production rate per unit mass. The integration\nof Equation (2) was performed using the penalty function formulation. The\ntemporal integration of Equation (3) was performed using the upwind PetrovGalerkin method with a fixed time-step of 0.1 Ma.\nThe model represents a strongly coupled ocean-continent convergent system (Clift and Vannucchi, 2004), affected by slab dehydration and progressive\nmantle wedge serpentinisation; erosion and sedimentation processes are also\naccounted for, while shear heating is not taken into account (Marotta and\nSpalla, 2007; Meda et al., 2010; Roda et al., 2010). The initial geometry,\nthe material parameters and the boundary conditions are the same as in\nRoda et al. (2010) except for the convergent velocity of 3 cm/a, which here\nis fixed up to a 50-km depth in the trench zone, along a 45o dip plane. The\nlithosphere base coincides with the 1600 K isotherm. We chose four different\nthicknesses of the oceanic lithosphere (60, 80, 95 and 110 km), and, to modify the thermal state of the overriding continental plate, we fixed for it five\ndifferent thicknesses at a distance of 800 km from the trench, with a continent/ocean ratio ranging from 100% to 200% of the thickness of the oceanic\nlithosphere (Fig. 1 and Table 1).\n3. Model results\nIn Figure 2, the results of the numerical simulations obtained for an 80km-thick oceanic lithosphere are shown, after 25 Ma from the subduction\n3\n\n\fstart. The ratio of the continental/oceanic plate thickness ranges from 100%\n(panel a1) to 200% (panel a5) and a decrease of the mean slab dip with the\nincrease of the upper lithosphere thickness is clearly evident (Fig. 2, from\na1 to a5). Together with the slab dip decrease, a friction increase between\nthe two plates occurs, increasing the ablation of the continental material\nbelonging to the overriding plate, according to Faccenda et al. (2008) and\nRoda et al. (2010). In addition, in a low dip configuration, the efficacy of the\ncrustal marker exhumation, driven by channel flow process, increases (Roda\net al., 2010), also producing the recycling of the upper oceanic crust and sediments (Fig. 2, panels a4 and a5). The large-scale stream-line analysis points\nout that the increase of the continental lithosphere thickness is accompanied\nby a reduction in the size of the right-side convective cell, until the development of a single-cell configuration (Fig. 2, b4 and b5). The large-scale\nleft-side convective cell concurs with the buoyancy and the suction to the\nslab flattening.\nThe influence of the lithospheric thickness variation (either oceanic and\ncontinental) on the subduction geometry was evaluated by plotting the slabtop profiles starting from a depth of 50 km, which is the lower limit of the\nfixed velocity vectors, and at 50 km from the trench, after 30 Ma from the\nsubduction start (Fig. 3). Generally, the slab profiles change with changes\nin the lithospheric thickness of the overriding plates, and this variability\nincreases with decreasing oceanic thickness.\nFor 60- and 80-km-thick oceanic lithospheres, the slab dip, evaluated to\ndepth of 250-300 km, decreases with increasing thickness of the continental\nlithosphere (Fig. 3, panels a and b). Below a depth of 200 km, a gradual\nincrease of the slab dip is predicted until reaching a near vertical setting followed, in some cases, by a dip inversion. For an oceanic lithosphere thicker\nthan 80 km, lower dip variability is observed with the increase of the continental thickness (Fig. 3, panels c and d). This is due to the colder global\nthermal state of the system (because of the considerable plate thicknesses,\neither oceanic or continental), that drives the formation of a major single\nconvective cell below the subducting plate and minimizes the intensity of the\nmantle circulation above the slab (Fig. 4, panels a and b), that is a primary\ncontrolling factor of the slab dip variability.\nThe analysis of the dip distribution from 50 to 400 km depth for oceanic\nlithospheres of 60 and 80 km and from 50 to 300 km depth for oceanic\nlithospheres of 95 and 110 km shows that a strong relationship exists between\nthe slab dip and the thickness of the continental lithosphere (Fig. 5, panel\n4\n\n\fa), with a rapid dip decrease with the continental plate thickness increase, in\nparticular for the oceanic thicknesses of 60, 80 and 95 km. A low correlation\nbetween the slab dip and the continental thickness was observed, with a near\nconstant dip between 27o and 32o for oceanic lithosphere thickness of 110\nkm. The results obtained for the 80-km-thick oceanic lithosphere show the\nmaximum slab dip variability.\nThe general dip decreasing with the increase of the continental lithosphere\nthickness also occurs when the imposed shallow angle is changed. The figure\n6 (panels a to d) shows the slab dip variation for an entrance dip of 37o :\nin this case, the variability is less evident because of the higher efficiency\nof the overriding plate suction; the latter becomes dominant when a 30o\nentrance dip is imposed, driving the underplating of the subducting plate\nand preventing the high dip variability with the thickness of the continental\nlithosphere (Fig. 6, panels e to h).\nAlthough a direct relationship also exists between the slab dip and the\ncontinent-ocean thickness ratio, a weaker correlation is observed in comparison to the absolute thickness of the continental lithosphere (Fig. 5, panels a\nand b). This suggests that the thermal state of the overriding plate has more\ninfluence on the control of the slab dip than the variation of the continentocean thickness ratio.\nIn agreement with Jarrard (1986), Cruciani et al. (2005) and Lallemand\net al. (2005), the model predictions suggest that a direct correlation between\nthe slab dip and the age of the oceanic lithosphere does not exist (Fig. 5,\npanel c).\n4. Comparison with the natural data\nTo compare the model predictions and the natural data we considered\nthe mean dips obtained for several worldwide ocean-continent subduction\nzones, extracted from the databases in Cruciani et al. (2005) and Lallemand\net al. (2005). The thickness of the overriding plate at a distance of 800\nkm from the trench for each natural data was based on the global thermal\nmodel of Artemieva (2006). Due to the lacking of thermal predictions in\nthe submerged areas, we excluded Japan and Aleutins subductions and some\ndata on the Mexico, Philippines and Indonesia subductions, and we grouped\nthe data into four classes of different oceanic lithosphere thickness: 60 km\n(data from 30 km to 70 km), 80 km (from 70 km to 85 km), 95 km (from\n90 km to 100 km) and 110 km (from 100 km to 145 km). The thicknesses\n5\n\n\fof the natural subduction plates derived as a function of the slab ages were\nobtained by Cruciani et al. (2005) and Lallemand et al. (2005) using the\nfollowing relation (Turcotte and Schubert, 2002):\ny = 2.32(kt)1/2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere y is the thickness of the oceanic lithosphere, k is the thermal diffusivity\nand t is the slab age. We used a total of 105 reference localities (Fig. 7, empty\ncircles).\nEven if the convergent velocities of the natural subduction systems were\nnot discriminated, a good agreement between the natural data and the model\npredictions occurs, with a similar trend of the dip related to the thickness\nvariation of the continental lithosphere: high slab dips seem to characterize\nthe subduction systems with thinner overriding plates, and the dips decrease\nwith increasing lithospheric thickness (Fig. 7). Furthermore, in natural cases,\nthe maximum variability of the slab dip is associated with oceanic lithosphere\nthicknesses of 60 and 80 km, while lower variability characterizes the thicker\noceanic plate thickness (e.g., 110 km), in agreement with the results obtained\nfrom numerical simulations (Fig. 5, panel a, and Fig. 7).\n5. Conclusions\nThe model predictions suggest that the slab dip is influenced by the thermal state of the overriding plate, and, in particular, for the cold overriding\nplate configuration, the efficacy of the right-side convective cell decreases\nand a shallower slab dip setting occurs. In contrast, in the hot overriding\nplate configuration, a highly efficient convective flow is developed in the right\nside of the model domain and a steeper subduction occurs. Furthermore, a\nthickness increase of the subducting plate decreases the variability of the slab\ngeometry, with the development of a stable single-convective cell, disregarding the thermal state of the overriding plate.\nThe model results also indicate that a direct correlation between the\nslab dip and the age of the oceanic lithosphere does not exist, at least for\nsubduction plates thinner that 110 km, as suggested by the statistical analysis\nof natural subductions. On the contrary, our comparative analysis strengths\nthe correlation between the slab dip and the thermal state of the overriding\nplate.\nTherefore, this study indicates that a factor not yet taken into account,\nnamely, the thermal state of the overriding plate, exerts a relevant influence\n6\n\n\fon the subduction geometry, although other simulations with different convergent rates are needed to enforce the cross-correlation between the different\nfactors and to quantify the role played by each one.\n6.
