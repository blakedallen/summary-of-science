Efimov predicted in 1970 that a unique set of\nthree-body bound states emerges when the interactions\nbetween any two of the three particles are resonantly enhanced [1]. While Efimov physics was discussed in the\ncontext of nuclear physics, they have attracted much attention in recent studies on collisions of cold atoms and\nmolecules. Cold atoms are excellent candidates to explore Efimov physics since the binary atomic interactions\ncan be controlled via a Feshbach resonance [2]. When the\ntwo-body scattering length a is tuned to a large and negative value, the emergence of an Efimov state near the\natomic scattering continuum can be identified from the\nstrongly enhanced recombination loss of trapped atoms\n[3]. This resonance is also called an Efimov resonance.

Figure 1 and Table I summarize the measurements based on single atomic species. A major surprise\nrevealed in these measurements is the constancy of the\nratio of the resonance position to the two-body van der\n(1)\nWaals length C = \u2212a\u2212 /rvdW = 8 \u223c 10, regardless of\nthe atomic spin configuration [11, 17], the Feshbach resonances employed to tune the scattering length [9], and\neven the atomic species (with 39 K being the only exception). This result is unexpected and challenges the theoretical understanding of Efimov physics in cold atoms.\nTheoretically, universality of Efimov physics across different Feshbach resonances in the same scattering channel was discussed in Ref. [18]. When the magnetic field\nis tuned to different Feshbach resonances, the field only\ninduces coupling to different molecular states, and does\nnot substantially modify the form nor the strength of the\npotential in the open channel. A fractional change of the\npotential less than 10\u22129 per Gauss is estimated for cesium atoms, which suggests the non-universal effects can\nremain unchanged when the field is tuned to different Feshbach resonances [18]. However, this argument does not\nexplain the universality for different spin configurations\nor atomic species.\nThe observed broad universality, as shown in Fig. 1, indicates that Efimov physics in cold atoms can in principle\nbe captured by a general physics picture that does not\ndepend on the details of the short range molecular potential, Zeeman shift, and spin configuration... The goal\nof this paper is to present one such model and compare\nour prediction with the measurements.\nWe begin with quantum scattering of three identical\natoms with short-range interactions. As in low-energy\nscattering of two atoms, low-energy scattering of three\natoms only affects the lowest partial wave (s\u2212wave)\nwhere all hyperangular momenta are in their ground\nstates. The lowest partial wave \u03c8 only depends on the hyperradius R and satisfies an effective Schroedinger equation as\n\n|a|\n\n1 mK\n\nVE ~ -R-2\n\nHyperspherical\nradius R\n\nVvdW ~ -R-6\nVm\n1,000 K\n\nFIG. 2: Illustration of three-atom interaction potential and\nthe wavefunction of the first Efimov state. In the hyperspherical coordinate, Efimov potential VE (R) = \u2212(s20 +\n1/4)h\u03042 /(2mR2 ) dominates for RvdW < R < |a|, and is\nreplaced by a repulsive potential for R > |a| [5]. Near\nR = RvdW , van der Waals potential \u223c \u22121/R6 quickly takes\nover the Efimov potential. At even shorter distances, molecular potential Vm (shaded area) becomes complex and deep,\nreaching 103 \u223c 104 K in temperature unit. The fast drop of\nthe potential energy near R = RvdW can quantum reflect the\nwavefunction of the Efimov bound state \u03c81 (R).\n\n[\u2212\n\nh\u03042 d2\n+ Vm (R) + VE (R)]\u03c8(R) = E\u03c8(R),\n2m dR2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Vm (R) is the short-range molecular potential,\n\u03c8(R) is the three-body wavefunction with energy E. Under Born-Oppenheimer approximation, the hyperspherical radius R =< r12 >=< r23 >=< r13 > equals to\nthe mean separation between any two atoms. The emergence of the first Efimov resonance is associated with the\nappearance of the first bound state at E = 0 when the\n(1)\nEfimov potential extends to R = |a\u2212 |, see Fig 2.\nThe two potential terms, molecular potential Vm and\nEfimov potential VE , are drastically different in their energy and length scales. The Efimov potential is longrange and dominates for R > RvdW , where RvdW is\nthe three-body van der Waals length. Near R = RvdW ,\nwhere Efimov potential is still about \u223cmK in temperature unit, the van der Waals potential quickly takes over.\nAt shorter range R < RvdW , the molecular potential is\nmuch deeper, typically 103 \u223c 104 K, and is very complicated due to non-additive terms [19] and contributions\nfrom channels with different spins and hyperangular momenta.\nTo estimate the three-body van der Waals length\nRvdW , we note that the asymptotic behavior of the\nthree-body potential can be approximated by the sum of\nthree pair-wise potentials [20]. Together with the BornOppenheimer approximation R = r12 = r23 = r13 , the\n\n\f3\nlong-range behavior of the molecular potential can be\nwritten as\n\n\u0100 = 4\u03c0\u0393(1/4)\u22122 31/4 rvdW .\n\n(4)\n\nTaking \u03c8(R = \u0100) = 0 as a boundary condition and ignoring the short-range potential Vm (R > \u0100) = 0, we can\nanalytically solve the Schroedinger equation Eq. 2 with\nthe Efimov potential Eq. 1. The positions of the Efimov\nresonances can be determined by solving the scattering\nlengths that extend the Efimov potential far enough to\nsupport an eigenstate with zero energy E = 0.

We note that it\n(N )\n(N +1)\nsatisfies the recursion relationship a\u2212\n= e\u03c0/s0 a\u2212 ,\nand the ratio of the first Efimov resonance to the twobody van der Waals length is thus given by\n\nvdW\n\n/r\n\nN=10\n\n-\n\n(1)\n\nwhere C6 is the two-body van der Waals coefficient and\n\u03a9 denotes all hyperangular variables. Leading order corrections include the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction\nof the order \u223c R\u22128 and the non-additive three-body interaction of the order R\u22129 [21]. Under these approximations, the three-body van der Waals length is related to\nthe two-body length as RvdW = 31/4 rvdw .\nThe crossover of the two potentials VE (R) and Vm (R)\nnear R = RvdW can lead to an interesting quantum reflection effect. Quantum reflections occur when the external force f = |dV /dx| is comparable or greater than\nthe local energy-to-length ratio of the particle (E \u2212 V )k,\nwhere k is the local scattering wavenumber. For an Efimov bound state at E = 0, this condition evaluated at\nR = RvdW gives f /k|V | \u2248 6, where the factor 6 comes\nfrom the exponent of the van der Waals potential. This\nresult justifies a strong quantum reflection [22]. With the\nassumption of a full and elastic quantum reflection, the\nEfimov wavefunction would develop a node near RvdW ,\nand the wavefunction amplitude is mostly outside the\nnode, see Fig. 2.\nTo accurately determine the position of the node, we\nnote that the nodal position of a wavefunction at low\nenergy is related to the scattering length, which for a\nvan der Waals potential, takes a nominal value of the\nmean scattering length \u0100 = 4\u03c0\u0393(1/4)\u22122 RvdW [7, 24],\nwhere \u0393(.) is the Gamma function.

Based on a square well\npotential model with the radius \u0100 given by Eq. 4, the first\nEfimov resonance position is calculated for identical particles\n(s0 \u2248 1.00624) in the presence of N = 1, 10, 100 and 1000\nshort-range vibrational bound states. The scattering phase\nshift varies in the range of \u03c6 = (N \u2212 1/2)\u03c0 \u223c (N + 1/2)\u03c0 for\nN bound states. The result is shown as a function of (\u03c6/\u03c0\nmod 1) for convenient comparison.\n\n(1)\n\nC=\n\na\u2212\n\u03c0 \u2212 tan\u22121 2s0\n= 4\u03c0\u0393(1/4)\u22122 31/4 exp(\n).

We assume\nVm (R > \u0100) = 0 and Vm (R < \u0100) = \u2212D, where \u0100 sets\nthe length scale of quantum reflection, and the potential\ndepth D\u221adetermines the short range scattering phase shift\nas \u03c6 = 2mD\u0100/h\u0304 for a zero energy state. The depth of\nthe potential can also be parameterized by the number\nof vibrational bound states as N = [\u03c6/\u03c0 + 1/2], where\n[x] is the integer part of x [24]. We can then calculate\n(1)\nthe location of the first Efimov resonance a\u2212 as a function of the phase shift \u03c6 in the vicinity of the potential\ndepths that support N = 1, 10, 100 and 1000 short-range\nmolecular states, see Fig. 3.\nOur calculation suggests that in a deep potential,\n(1)\na\u2212 /rvdw is in general a universal constant and is insensitive to the scattering phase shift \u03c6. This is an expected\nresult since quantum reflection works better when the\nshort range potential is deeper. Near \u03c6 = (N \u2212 1/2)\u03c0,\nwhere N = 1, 2, .., however, the universality breaks\n\n\f4\ndown. Remarkably, the condition \u03c6 = (N \u2212 1/2)\u03c0 is\nexactly that for having a new bound state at the threshold. We can thus conclude that the universal value of\n(1)\nC = \u2212a\u2212 /rvdw = const. holds as long as the shortrange potential is deep enough to support many bound\nstates, and none of them is near the dissociation threshold. For alkali atoms with typically 100 or more molecular states, our model suggests that even with a randomlydistributed three-body phase shift \u03c6, the probability to\nobtain C = 9 \u223c 10 is 95% or higher. This result explains\nthe universality of the ratio C in many experiments, and\nthe exceptional case of 39 K can potentially be associated\nwith the existence of a bound state near the continuum,\nwhich resonantly shifts the Efimov resonance position.\nTo conclude, we obtained a simple physics picture\nbased on quantum reflection to understand the universal\nscaling of the Efimov resonance position by the van der\nWaals length. Quantum reflection of the Efimov wavefunction occurs because of the presence of a very deep\nand short range molecular potential. Assuming complete\nquantum reflection near the mean scattering length, we\n(1)\nobtain the universal ratio of C = a\u2212 /rvdW = 9.48..,\nwhich agrees well with the universal value observed in\nexperiments. Based on a square well model, we show\nthat Efimov resonance positions are insensitive to the\nthree-body phase shift as long as the short range poten-\n\n[1] V. Efimov, Phys. Lett.

Analysis on the role of different van der Waals\nlength scales and scattering phase shifts between different atoms is needed in order to determine the universality\nof the Efimov energy structure in systems with unequal\nmasses.\nWe want to emphasize that the universality of Efimov\nphysics in cold atoms remains hypothetical. Our quantum reflection model provides a simple picture to understand the fixed nodal position of the Efimov wavefunction. However, detailed calculations incorporating foreign scattering channels, especially those inducing the\nFeshbach coupling, as well as non-Born-Oppenheimer,\nand higher-order potential terms, are needed to test the\ngenuineness of the universality, as well as to understand\nthe appearance of the non-universal case, such as 39 K.\nWe thank C.
