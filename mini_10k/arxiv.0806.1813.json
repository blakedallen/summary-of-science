Chiu\n\n1. Introduction\nIn Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the topological susceptibility (\u03c7t ) is the most crucial\nquantity to measure the topological charge fluctuations of the QCD vacuum, which plays an important role in breaking the UA (1) symmetry. Theoretically, \u03c7t is defined as\n\n\u03c7t =\n\nZ\n\nd 4 x h\u03c1 (x)\u03c1 (0)i\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere\n\n\u03c1 (x) =\n\n1\n\u03b5\ntr[F\u03bc\u03bd (x)F\u03bb \u03c3 (x)]\n32\u03c0 2 \u03bc\u03bd\u03bb \u03c3\n\nis the topological charge density (\u221d axial anomaly) expressed in term of the matrix-valued field\ntensor F\u03bc\u03bd .\nWith mild assumptions, Witten [1] and Veneziano [2] obtained a relationship between the\ntopological susceptibility in the quenched approximation and the mass of \u03b7 \u2032 meson (flavor singlet)\nin full QCD with N f degenerate flavors, namely, \u03c7t (quenched) = f\u03c02 m2\u03b7 \u2032 /(4N f ) where f\u03c0 = 131\nMeV, the decay constant of pion. This implies that the mass of \u03b7 \u2032 is essentially due to the axial\nanomaly relating to non-trivial topological charge fluctuations, which can turn out to be nonzero\neven in the chiral limit, unlike those of the (non-singlet) approximate Goldstone bosons.\nUsing the Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT), Leutwyler and Smilga [3] obtained the following relation in the chiral limit,\n\n\u03c7t =\n\nmq \u03a3\n+ O(m2q )\nNf\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhere mq is the quark mass, and \u03a3 is the chiral condensate. In other words, as mq \u2192 0, the topological susceptibility is suppressed due to internal quark loops. Most importantly, (1.2) provides a\nviable way to extract \u03a3 from \u03c7t in the chiral limit.\nFrom (1.1), one obtains\n\n\u03c7t =\n\nQt2\n,\n\u03a9\n\nQt \u2261\n\nZ\n\nd 4 x\u03c1 (x)\n\nwhere \u03a9 is the volume of the system, and Qt is the topological charge (which is an integer for QCD).\nThus, one can obtain \u03c7t by counting the number of gauge configurations for each topological sector.\nObviously, for a set of gauge configurations in the topologically-trivial sector with Qt = 0, it gives\n\u03c7t = 0. However, even for a topologically-trivial gauge configuration, it may possess non-trivial\ntopological excitations in sub-volumes. Thus, one can investigate whether there are topological\nexcitations within any sub-volumes, and to measure \u03c7t using the correlation of the topological\ncharges of two sub-volumes [4].\nIn general, for any topological sector with Qt , using saddle point expansion on the QCD partition function in a finite volume, it can be shown that [5] (see also [6])\n\u0012\n\u0013\nc4\n1 Qt2\n\u2212 \u03c7t \u2212\n+ O(\u03a9\u22123 )\n(1.3)\nlim h\u03c1 (x)\u03c1 (0)i =\n\u03a9 \u03a9\n2\u03c7t \u03a9\n|x|\u2192\u221e\n2\n\n\fTopological susceptibility in 2-flavor lattice QCD with fixed topology\n\nT.W. Chiu\n\nwhere\nc4 = \u2212\n\n\u0003\n1\u0002 4\nhQt i\u03b8 =0 \u2212 3hQt2 i2\u03b8 =0\n\u03a9\n\nThus, one can consider two spatial sub-volumes at time slices t1 and t2 , and to measure their\ntime-correlation function\nC(t1 \u2212 t2 ) = hQ(t1 )Q(t2 )i =\n\n\u2211 h\u03c1 (x1)\u03c1 (x2 )i\n\n~x1 ,~\nx2\n\nwhere the summations run over the spatial volumes at t1 and t2 respectively. Then its plateau at\nlarge |t1 \u2212 t2 | can be used to extract \u03c7t , provided that |c4 | \u226a 2\u03c7t2 \u03a9.\nHowever, for lattice QCD, it is difficult to extract \u03c1 (x) and Qt unambiguously from the gauge\nlink variables, due to their rather strong fluctuations.\nTo circumvent this difficulty, one may consider the Atiyah-Singer index theorem [7]\nQt = n+ \u2212 n\u2212 = index(D)\n\n(1.4)\n\nwhere n\u00b1 is the number of zero modes of the massless Dirac operator D \u2261 \u03b3\u03bc (\u2202\u03bc + igA\u03bc ) with \u00b1\nchirality. Since D is anti-Hermitian and chirally symmetric, its nonzero eigenmodes must come\nin complex conjugate pairs (i.e., D \u03c6 = i\u03bb \u03c6 implies D \u03b35 \u03c6 = \u2212i\u03bb \u03b35 \u03c6 , for \u03bb = \u03bb \u2217 6= 0) with zero\nR\nchirality ( d 4 x\u03c6 \u2020 \u03b35 \u03c6 = 0). Thus one can obtain the identity\nn+ \u2212 n\u2212 =\n\nZ\n\nd 4 x m tr[\u03b35 (D + m)\u22121 (x, x)]\n\n(1.5)\n\nby spectral decomposition, where the nonzero modes drop out due to zero chirality. In view of (1.4)\nand (1.5), one can regard m tr[\u03b35 (D + m)\u22121 (x, x)] as topological charge density, to replace \u03c1 (x) in\nthe measurement of \u03c7t .\nFor lattice QCD, it is well-known that the overlap Dirac operator [8] in a topological non-trivial\ngauge background possesses exact zero modes (with definite chirality) satisfying the Atiyah-Singer\nindex theorem. Writing the massive overlap Dirac operator as\n\u0010\nm\u0011\nm\u0011 \u0010\nHw (\u2212m0 )\n+ m0 \u2212\nD(m) = m0 +\n\u03b35 p\n2\n2\nHw2 (\u2212m0 )\n\nwhere Hw (\u2212m0 ) is the standard Hermitian Wilson operator with negative mass \u2212m0 (0 < m0 < 2),\nthen the topological charge density can be defined as\n\n\u03c11 (x) = m tr[\u03b35 (Dc + m)\u22121\nx,x ]\nwhere (Dc + m)\u22121 is the valence quark propagator with quark mass m, and Dc is a chirally symmetric and non-local operator, relating to D(0) by Dc = D(0)[1 \u2212 D(0)/(2m0 )]\u22121 [9]. Note that\n(Dc + m)\u22121 is exponentially-local for sufficiently smooth gauge background and nonzero m. Here\n\u03c11 (x) is justified to be topological charge density, since it can be shown that (see e.g., [10])\n\n\u2211 \u03c11(x) = m Tr[\u03b35 (Dc + m)\u22121\nx,x ] = n+ \u2212 n\u2212\nx\n\n3\n\n(1.6)\n\n\fTopological susceptibility in 2-flavor lattice QCD with fixed topology\n\nT.W.

A better alternative is to compute the correlator of the flavor-singlet pseudoscalar\nmeson \u03b7 \u2032 , which behaves as [4, 5]\nlim\n\n|x|\u226b1\n\n1\n\u03b7 (x)\u03b7 (0) \u2243\n\u03a9\n\u2032\n\nm2q\n\n\u2032\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\nQt2\nc4\n+ O(e\u2212m\u03b7 \u2032 |x| ) + O(\u03a9\u22123 )\n\u2212 \u03c7t \u2212\n\u03a9\n2\u03c7t \u03a9\n\n(1.7)\n\n\u2032\n\u2212Mt + e\u2212M(T \u2212t) ) to extract\nThen the time-correlation\n\u0010 2 function of \u03b7\u0011 (see Fig. 1(a)) is fitted to A + B(e\nQ\nthe constant A = m12 T1 \u03a9t \u2212 \u03c7t \u2212 2\u03c7ct4\u03a9 and \u03c7t , provided that |c4 | \u226a 2\u03c7t2 \u03a9.\nq\n\n0.008\n3\n\n16 x32, \u03b2=2.30, msea=mval=0.025\n\nf\n\nX\n\ndisconnected\nconnected\n\u2212\u03b7' = disconnect - connect / Nf\n\n0.004\n\nA + cosh\nA\n\nC(t)\n\n0\n\nx\n\nC\u03b7'(t) = - 1N \u03a3\n\n0.006\n\n0.002\n\nx\n\n0.000\n\n-0.002\n\n0\n\nX\n\nx\n\n+\u03a3\n\n-0.004\n\nx\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nt\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 1: (a) A schematic diagram for the time-correlation function of the flavor singlet pseudoscalar meson operator.

For the gluon part, the Iwasaki action is used at \u03b2 = 2.30, together with unphysical\nWilson fermions and associated twisted-mass ghosts [11]. The unphysical degrees of freedom\ngenerate a factor det[Hw2 (\u2212m0 )/(Hw2 (\u2212m0 ) + \u03bc 2 )] in the partition function (we take m0 = 1.6 and\n\u03bc = 0.2) that suppresses the near-zero eigenvalue of Hw (\u2212m0 ) and thus makes the numerical operation with the overlap operator substantially faster.

After discarding\n500 trajectories for thermalization, we accumulate 10,000 trajectories in total for each sea quark\nmass. In the calculation of \u03c7t , we take one configuration every 20 trajectories, thus we have 500\nconfigurations for each mq . For each configuration, 50 pairs of lowest-lying eigenmodes of the\noverlap-Dirac operator D(0) are calculated using the implicitly restarted Lanczos algorithm and\nstored for the later use.\n\n3. Results\nFor the connected diagram (see Fig. 1(a)), the pion correlator is computed using the conjugate gradient algorithm with a low-mode preconditioning. Low-modes are also used for averaging\nover source points [12], which significantly improves the statistical signal. For the disconnected\ndiagram, the quark propagator is represented by the eigenmode decomposition and approximated\nby the 50 conjugate pairs of the low-lying eigenmodes. The quark propagator is then obtained for\nany source point without extra computational cost, and the disconnected loops can be calculated\nwith an average over the source point. The truncation is motivated by the expectation that the long\ndistance correlation is dominated by the low-lying fermion modes; its validity has to be checked\nnumerically (see below).\nIn Fig. 1(b), we plot C\u03b7 \u2032 (t) together with those of connected and disconnected parts for mq =\n0.025. The curve is a fit to a function A + B(e\u2212Mt + e\u2212M(T \u2212t) ) with data for C\u03b7 \u2032 (t) in the range\nt \u2208 [4, 28]. The horizontal line is a fitted constant A = 1.70(13) \u00d7 10\u22123 , where the error is estimated\nusing the jackknife method with bin size of 20 configurations, with which the statistical error\nsaturates. Assuming |c4 | \u226a 2\u03c7t2 \u03a9, we obtain a4 \u03c7t = 3.40(27) \u00d7 10\u22125 at mq = 0.025.\nSince the disconnected diagram is computed with only 50 pairs of low-lying eigenmodes, we\nhave to check whether they suffice to saturate C\u03b7 \u2032 (t). For the time range [4, 28] used for fitting, as\nthe number of eigenmodes is increased from 10 to 30, the change of correlator |\u03b4 C\u03b7 \u2032 |/C\u03b7 \u2032 is \u223c 3%,\nwhile from 30 to 50, it is only \u223c 0.3%, which is less than 8% of the statistical error. Thus C\u03b7 \u2032 is\nwell saturated with 50 eigenmodes. This also holds for all six sea quark masses.\nIn Fig. 2, we plot the topological susceptibility \u03c7t a4 as a function of the sea quark mass\nmq a, The statistical precision is good enough to find a clear dependence on the sea quark mass.\nFor the smallest three quark masses, 0.015, 0.025, and 0.035, the data are well fitted by a linear function F + Gm with the intercept F = 0.0(1) \u00d7 10\u22125 and the slope G = 0.00133(5). Evidently, the intercept is consistent with zero, in agreement with the \u03c7 PT expectation (1.2). Equating the slope to a3 \u03a3/N f , we obtain a3 \u03a3 = 0.0027(1). In order to convert \u03a3 to that in the MS\nscheme, we calculate the renormalization factor ZmMS (2 GeV) using the non-perturbative renormalization technique through the RI/MOM scheme [13]. Our result is ZmMS (2GeV) = 0.742(12)\n[14]. With a\u22121 = 1670(20)(20) MeV determined with r0 = 0.49 fm [15], the value of \u03a3 is transcribed to \u03a3MS (2GeV) = [252(5)(10)MeV]3 , which is in good agreement with our previous result\n[251(7)(11) MeV]3 [16] obtained in the \u03b5 -regime from the low-lying eigenvalues. The errors represent a combined statistical error (a\u22121 and ZmMS ) and the systematic error estimated from the higher\n5\n\n\fTopological susceptibility in 2-flavor lattice QCD with fixed topology\n\nT.W.

We check the universality of\n\u03c7t as follows. At sea quark mass mq = 0.050, we generate 250 configurations with Q = \u22122 and\n\u22124 respectively in addition to the main run at Q = 0. Then we extract \u03c7t from the time-correlation\nfunction of \u03b7 \u2032 , similar to the Q = 0 case. Our results for a4 \u03c7t are: {7.4(1.3), 6.4(2.1), 5.9(1.8)} \u00d7\n10\u22125 for Q = {0, \u22122, \u22124} respectively. Evidently, \u03c7t extracted from different topological sectors\nare consistent with each other within the statistical error.\nFinally, we come to the assumption |c4 | \u226a 2\u03c7t2 \u03a9 in extracting \u03c7t via (1.3). With the formulas\nderived in [5], we can obtain an estimate of the upper bound of |c4 |/(2\u03c7t2 \u03a9) by measuring the\ntwo-point correlator h\u03c11 (x1 )\u03c11 (x2 )i and the four-point correlator h\u03c11 (x1 )\u03c11 (x2 )\u03c11 (x3 )\u03c11 (x4 )i. Our\npreliminary result is |c4 |/(2\u03c7t2 \u03a9) < 0.1, for all six sea quark masses. Details of this calculation\nwill be presented elsewhere. We note that the upper bound |c4 |/(2\u03c7t2 \u03a9) < 0.1 is also consistent\nwith the ratio |c4 |/\u03c7t \u2243 0.3 obtained in the quenched approximation [17].\n\n4. Conclusion\nIn this paper, we have determined the topological susceptibility \u03c7t in two-flavor QCD from a\nlattice calculation of two-point correlators at a fixed global topological charge Qt = 0. The expected\nsea quark mass dependence of \u03c7t from \u03c7 PT is clearly observed with the good statistical precision\nwe achieved, in contrast to the previous unquenched lattice calculations. Our result indicates that\nthe topologically non-trivial excitations (e.g., instanton and anti-instanton pairs) are in fact locally\n6\n\n\fTopological susceptibility in 2-flavor lattice QCD with fixed topology\n\nT.W. Chiu\n\nactive in the QCD vacuum, even when the global topological charge is kept fixed. The information\nof these topological excitations is carried by low-lying fermion eigenmodes if the exact chiral\nsymmetry is preserved on the lattice. This work demonstrates that Monte Carlo simulation of\nlattice QCD with fixed topology is a viable approach, to be pursued when the topology change\nhardly occurs near the continuum limit even with chirally non-symmetric lattice fermions. The\nartifacts due to the fixed topology in a finite volume can be removed to obtain the physics results\nin the \u03b8 vacuum, provided that \u03c7t has been determined in the first place [5, 6], as has been done in\nthis work.\nNumerical simulations are performed on Hitachi SR11000 and IBM System Blue Gene Solution at High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) under a support of its Large Scale\nSimulation Program (No. 07-16), and also in part on NEC SX-8 at YITP (Kyoto U), NEC SX-8 at\nRCNP (Osaka U), and IBM/HP clusters at NCHC and NTU-CC (Taiwan).
