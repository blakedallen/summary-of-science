Introduction\nThe polarization of spin 1/2 baryons inclusively produced in polarized Deep Inelastic Scattering processes may be useful, if measurable, to obtain new information\non polarized distribution and fragmentation functions. A lot of attention has recently been dedicated to the self-revealing polarization of \u039b's and other hyperons\n[1]-[12]. Most papers, with the exception of Refs. [5], [8] and [11], do not consider\nweak interaction contributions, due to lack of available experimental information.\nNOMAD collaboration have recently published some very interesting results [13]\non the \u039b polarization in \u03bd\u03bc charged current interactions; more data might soon be\navailable from high energy neutral current processes at HERA, due to electro-weak\ninterference effects. It is then appropriate and timely to perform a systematical\nand comprehensive study of weak interaction contributions to the production and\nthe polarization of baryons in as many as possible DIS processes. We stress that\nsuch contributions are an important source of new information, due to the natural\nneutrino polarization and to the selected couplings of W 's to pure helicity states.\nWe consider weak interactions in the following processes:\n\u03bdp\n\u03bd\u0304 p\n\u2212\nl p\nl+ p\n\u03bdp\n\u03bd\u0304 p\nlp\n\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\nl\u2212 \u039b \u2191 + X\nl+ \u039b \u2191 + X\n\u03bd \u039b\u2191 + X\n\u03bd\u0304 \u039b\u2191 + X\n\u03bd \u039b\u2191 + X\n\u03bd\u0304 \u039b\u2191 + X\nl \u039b\u2191 + X\n\n(charged current)\n(charged current)\n(charged current)\n(charged current)\n(neutral current)\n(neutral current)\n(neutral current)\n\nwhere the lepton l and the proton p may or may not be polarized, whereas the\nneutrinos are obviously always polarized (\u03bb\u03bd = \u22121/2, \u03bb\u03bd\u0304 = +1/2).\nIn our calculations we take into account leading twist factorization theorem,\nStandard Model elementary interactions at lowest perturbative order and LO QCD\nevolution only. Consequently the cross-sections for the production of a hadron B in\nthe current fragmentation region are given by\nX\nd\u03c3\nd\u03c3\u0302\n=\nDB/q (z, Q2 ) ,\nq(x, Q2 )\ndx dy dz\ndy\nq\n\n(1)\n\nwhere q(x, Q2 ) is the quark q distribution function, DB/q (z, Q2 ) is the fragmentation\nfunction of the quark into the detected hadron B, and d\u03c3\u0302/dy is the elementary crosssection. The usual DIS variables x, y and z are defined as x = Q2 /2p*q, y = q *p/l*p\nand z = pB * p/p * q (see also Appendix B).\nIn Sections 2-4 we consider separately the different processes, and derive explicit\nexpressions for the polarization of a final baryon B in terms of elementary dynamics,\nquark distribution and fragmentation functions. In Section 5 we discuss how experimental data could be used to obtain specific new information and give predictions\n1\n\n\ffor several processes which might be of interest in the near future. In Appendix A\nwe give full information on the kinematical ranges and configurations for each of\nthe experiments in progress or planned, used to derive our numerical results. In\nAppendix B we discuss mass effects in the fragmentation process, to clarify differences and relationships between different definitions of the variable on which the\nfragmentation functions depend.\n2.

[11].\nThe formulae given above hold for any baryon and antibaryon with spin 1/2. If\nwe specify the final hadron observed, further simplifications are possible. Let's consider the case in which a \u039b baryon is produced, or, in general, a baryon (rather than\nan antibaryon): in this case we can neglect terms which contain both q\u0304 distributions\n(in a proton) and q\u0304 fragmentations (into a \u039b) as they are both small, in particular\nat large x and z. Then we simply have:\n(\u00b1)\n\n\u2206D\u039b/u\n,\nD\u039b/u\n\n(19)\n\n\u2206D\u039b/d + R \u2206D\u039b/s\n,\nD\u039b/d + R D\u039b/s\n\n(20)\n\n(0)\n\nP[\u03bd,l] (\u039b; z) \u2243 P[\u03bd,l] (\u039b; z) \u2243 \u2212\n(\u00b1)\n\n(0)\n\nP[\u03bd\u0304,l] (\u039b; z) \u2243 P[\u03bd\u0304,l] (\u039b; z) \u2243 \u2212\n\nand the polarizations, up to QCD evolution effects, become functions of the variable\nz only, since any other term apart from the fragmentation functions cancels out.\nFor Eq. (20) to hold one should also avoid large y regions, due to the factor (1 \u2212 y)2\nin Eq. (18).\nEqs. (19) and (20) relate the values of the longitudinal polarization P (\u039b) to a\nquantity with a clear physical meaning, i.e. the ratio \u2206D\u039b/q /D\u039b/q ; this happens\nwith weak charged current interactions \u2013 while it cannot happen in purely electromagnetic DIS [12] \u2013 due to the selection of the quark helicity and flavour in the\ncoupling with neutrinos. A measurement of P (\u039b) offers new direct information on\nthe fragmentation process. We shall discuss further this point in Section 5.\nSimilar results hold for the lp \u2192 \u03bd\u039b\u2191 X processes; the contributing elementary\ninteractions are:\nl\u2212 u i\nl\u2212 d \u0304j\nl+ d j\nl+ \u016bi\n\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\n\u03bd dj\n\u03bd \u016bi\n\u03bd\u0304 ui\n\u03bd\u0304 d \u0304j\n\n(21)\n\nwith the same cross-sections as those computed in Eqs.

Numerical estimates\nIn the previous Sections we have obtained explicit expressions for the polarization\nof baryons produced in DIS scatterings involving weak interactions; we now use these\nformulae to give predictions in the case of \u039b and \u039b\u0304 production, considering typical\nkinematical configurations of ongoing or planned experiments. When convenient,\nwe integrate over the actual physical ranges of some variables; these are collected in\nTable 1 of Appendix A. Our results should give a good comprehensive description\nof what to expect in all present or future experiments, and can be adapted to cover\nall realistic situations, according to different kinematical cuts and configurations.\nThe polarization values depend on the known Standard Model dynamics, on\nthe rather well known partonic distributions, both unpolarized and polarized, and\non the quark fragmentation functions, again both unpolarized and polarized. The\nlatter are not so well known and a choice must be made in order to give numerical\nestimates or in order to be able to interpret the measured values in favour of a\nparticular set.\nUnpolarized \u039b fragmentation functions are determined by fitting e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u039b +\n\u039b\u0304 + X experimental data, which are sensitive only to singlet combinations, like\nD\u039b/q + D\u039b/q\u0304 \u2261 D(\u039b+\u039b\u0304)/q . It is impossible to separate the fragmentation functions\nrelative to \u039b's from those for \u039b\u0304's in a model independent way; also flavour separation\nis not possible without appropriate initial assumptions, for example about SU(3)\nflavour symmetry. Polarized \u039b fragmentation functions are obtained by fitting the\nscarce data on \u039b polarization at LEP, sensitive only to non-singlet combinations\nval\nlike \u2206D\u039b/q \u2212 \u2206D\u039b/q\u0304 = \u2206D\u039b/q\n. Also in this case flavour separation has to rely on\nmodels.\nThree typical sets of fragmentation functions, denoted as scenarios 1, 2 and 3, and\nderived from fits to e+ e\u2212 data, are given in Ref. [4]. The unpolarized fragmentation\nfunctions are taken to be SU(3) symmetric:\nD(\u039b+\u039b\u0304)/u = D(\u039b+\u039b\u0304)/d = D(\u039b+\u039b\u0304)/s = D(\u039b+\u039b\u0304)/\u016b = D(\u039b+\u039b\u0304)/d \u0304 = D(\u039b+\u039b\u0304)/s\u0304 ,\n\n(48)\n\nand have been derived for the combined production of \u039b and \u039b\u0304 and not for each of\nthem separately.\nFor the polarized fragmentation functions they assume, at the initial scale \u03bc2 :\n\u2206D\u039b/s (z, \u03bc2 ) = z \u03b1 D(\u039b+\u039b\u0304)/s (z, \u03bc2 ) ,\n\u2206D\u039b/u (z, \u03bc2 ) = \u2206D\u039b/d (z, \u03bc2 ) = Nu \u2206D\u039b/s (z, \u03bc2 ) .\n9\n\n(49)\n\n\fThe three scenarios differ for the relative contributions of the strange quark polarization to \u039b polarization: Nu = 0, Nu = \u22120.2 and Nu = 1 for scenarios 1, 2 and\n3 respectively [4]. The \"unfavoured\" polarized fragmentations \u2206D\u039b/\u016b , \u2206D\u039b\u0304/u , etc.\nare assumed to be negligible at the initial scale \u03bc2 , and are only generated by QCD\nevolution; it is then possible, for the polarized fragmentation functions, to obtain\nseparately the contributions to \u039b and \u039b\u0304.\nWe adopt the above set of fragmentation functions as they are the least dependent on models, they have the proper QCD evolution, and the three scenarios\nare well representative of possible spin dependences. We are then equipped with\nunpolarized fragmentation functions into \u039b + \u039b\u0304 and with separate polarized fragmentation functions into \u039b and \u039b\u0304; we wish to give predictions and estimates for\nthe polarizations of \u039b and \u039b\u0304, which are measured separately. We then define the\nfollowing computable quantities:\nP \u2217 (\u039b) \u2261\n\nd\u03c3 \u039b+ \u2212 d\u03c3 \u039b\u2212\nP (\u039b)\n,\n=\n\u039b+\n\u039b\u0304\n1+T\nd\u03c3\n\n(50)\n\nand\n\nd\u03c3 \u039b\u0304+ \u2212 d\u03c3 \u039b\u0304\u2212\nT\n,\n= P (\u039b\u0304)\n\u039b+\n\u039b\u0304\n1+T\nd\u03c3\nwhere the notations should be obvious and\nP \u2217 (\u039b\u0304) \u2261\n\nT =\n\n(51)\n\nd\u03c3 \u039b\u0304\n*\nd\u03c3 \u039b\n\n(52)\n\nEqs. (50) and (51) allow to compute the values of P (\u039b) and P (\u039b\u0304) provided one\ncan compute or measure the ratio T :\n\u0012\n\nP (\u039b) = (1 + T ) P \u2217 (\u039b) ,\n\nP (\u039b\u0304) = 1 +\n\n1\nT\n\n\u0013\n\nP \u2217 (\u039b\u0304) .\n\n(53)\n\nNotice that P is always larger in magnitude than P \u2217 .\nThe ratio T cannot be computed with the fragmentation set of Ref. [4]; it\nrequires the knowledge of separate unpolarized fragmentation functions for \u039b and\n\u039b\u0304 and it depends on the chosen set.\nIn Figs. 1-10 we show some results for P \u2217 (\u039b, \u039b\u0304) for several processes, with different initial spin configurations, and different kinematical conditions, corresponding\nto typical experimental setups, shown in Table 1 of Appendix A. These may easily\nbe changed, according to experimental situations. Details are given in the figure\ncaptions. We use the unpolarized distribution functions of Refs. [14], the related\npolarized distribution functions of Ref. [15] (we have explicitely checked that our\nnumerical results depend very little on the available sets of parton densities) and\nthe fragmentation functions of Ref. [4], mainly with scenarios 2 and 3.\nIn Figs. 11-12 we give estimates for P (\u039b) [rather than P \u2217 (\u039b)], in the same\ncases of some of the previous figures; we have computed the ratio T either with the\n10\n\n\fSU(3) symmetric set of unpolarized fragmentation functions of Ref. [9] or with a\nset derived from Ref. [16], by imposing SU(3) symmetry.\nThe figure captions contain all relevant information about the various cases; we\ngive here some general comments about our results.\n\u2022 We present results using mainly the fragmentation functions of scenarios 2\nand 3 of Ref. [4], neglecting scenario 1, in which only s quarks contribute to\n\u039b polarization. In fact, P (\u039b) is always negligible in this case, given the small\ncontent of s quarks in the nucleon target and the SU(3)-symmetric nature of\nthe unpolarized fragmentation functions utilized. This can be seen by inspecting Eqs. (19), (20) and (26), (27) for charged current interactions and Eq.\n(37) for neutral currents. However, it is interesting to notice that for unpolarized fragmentation functions allowing for a strong SU(3) symmetry breaking,\nlike those of Ref. [16], the situation can be different, and scenario 1 might\ngive sizeable asymmetries. According to Ref. [16], D\u039b/u = D\u039b/d \u226a D\u039b/s and\nthis can well compensate for the small factor R in Eq. (20), so that, also in\nscenario 1, P[\u03bd\u0304,l] can be large.\n\u2022 Figs. 1, 2 and 11 summarize some of the most interesting features of \u039b polarization in charged current interactions. The large hxi values involved in\nNOMAD experiment imply T = d\u03c3 \u039b\u0304 /d\u03c3 \u039b \u226a 1, so that, from Eq. (50), P \u2217 (\u039b)\nis similar to P (\u039b) (compare Figs. 2 and 11) and follows closely the simple\nbehaviour suggested by Eqs. (19) and (20). P \u2217 (\u039b\u0304), instead, is suppressed by\nthe the small ratio T , see Eq. (51); the actual estimated value of P (\u039b\u0304) is\nshown in Fig. 11 and is much larger. Notice that a comparison between Figs.\n1 and 2, i.e. between Eqs. (19) and (20), might give information on the ratios\nCq \u2261 \u2206D\u039b/q /D\u039b/q ; for example, the same value of Cq for all flavours would\nresult in P[\u03bd,l] (\u039b) = P[\u03bd\u0304,l] (\u039b). On the other hand, largely different values of\nP[\u03bd,l] and P[\u03bd\u0304,l] would certainly indicate a strong SU(3) symmetry breaking in\nthe fragmentation functions, with s quark contributions dominating in order\nto compensate for the small R factor in Eq. (20).\n(0)\n\nSome data on P[\u03bd,l] (\u039b, \u039b\u0304) are available from NOMAD collaboration [13], but\nthe errors and uncertainties are still too large to allow significant comparisons\nand to discriminate between different sets of fragmentation functions.\n\u2022 Fig. 3 gives values of P \u2217 (\u039b) in kinematical regions dominated by small x\nvalues, so that one expects T \u2243 1 and P \u2217 (\u039b, \u039b\u0304) \u2243 P (\u039b, \u039b\u0304)/2, Eqs. (50) and\n(51). The opposite signs of P (\u039b) and P (\u039b\u0304) can be easily understood by looking\nat Eq. (25) (with q\u00b1 \u2192 q/2) and noticing that fragmentation into a baryon\nor an antibaryon favours the first or the second term in the numerator.\n\u2022 For neutrino charged currents we give numerical estimates only in the case\nof an unpolarized target. In fact, present intensities of neutrino beams require very large targets to reach reasonable luminosities and statistics, and\n11\n\n\fthis makes unpractical to polarize them. There are however proposals for neutrino factories with large intensities which will allow to consider the option of\npolarized targets [17].\n\u2022 The \u039b polarizations for neutral currents shown in Figs. 4, 5, 6 and 7 exhibit\na similar behaviour for the four different kinematical setups considered. The\ndifferences are related to the different kinematical cuts and again to the value\nof the factor T . In particular, since T \u2243 1 for E665 and HERA kinematics, the\nP \u2217 are suppressed by a factor \u2243 2 with respect to the case of HERMES and\nCOMPASS kinematics. Notice also that in these two cases there are sizeable\nvariations depending on the different polarization states of the target.\n\u2022 The results presented in Figs. 8 and 12 show polarizations as functions of x\n(integrated over z) rather than z (integrated over x): these test the dynamics of the partonic process and in particular the contribution of electro-weak\ninterferences, in a neat and unusual way. The differences between positively\nand negatively charged leptons are entirely due to electro-weak effects; this\nis well visible at large x (implying large Q2 ), where the curves for e+ and\ne\u2212 differ sizeably. Moreover, from Eqs. (39)-(41) it is possible to evaluate\nanalytically the zeros of the cross-section differences d\u03c3\u0302\u00b1+ \u2212 d\u03c3\u0302\u00b1\u2212 appearing\nin the numerator of Eq. (44); one can show that real zeros for 0 < x < 1\noccur only for electromagnetic + weak contributions and for positron beams.\nThe effective position of the zeros depends on y (or alternatively on Q2 ) and\nfor the dominating small y values is around x \u2243 0.04 - 0.08. Although the\nstatistical errors increase sizeably for large x values at HERA, the different\nbehaviour shown at small and large x values for positron and electron beams\nmight probably be tested.\nFig. 12 shows the same plots as in Fig. 8, for the actual polarization P (\u039b),\nestimated according to the comments in the figure caption, rather than for\nP \u2217 (\u039b); it is interesting to note how the differences between P and P \u2217 vary\nwith x, according to the observations we have already made.\n\u2022 Fig. 9 shows the parity violating longitudinal polarization of \u039b's produced\nfrom unpolarized initial electrons and nucleons in NC processes; being a purely\nelectro-weak effect it is more sizeable at very large Q2 values, which are, however, accessible at HERA. Also Fig. 10 shows some effects of electro-weak\n\u2217 (+,0)\ninterferences, resulting in differences between plots of P[e,e]\nfor positrons\nand electrons.\nWe have given a comprehensive discussion \u2013 both theoretical (at LO) and phenomenological \u2013 of the polarization of \u039b's and \u039b\u0304's produced in the current fragmentation region of DIS processes, both with neutral and charged currents. Our\nresults can be exploited to gather new information about polarized fragmentation\nfunctions, to improve our knowledge about polarized parton densities [18] and to test\n12\n\n\ffundamental features of electro-weak elementary interactions. Several experiments\nare either running or being planned, which will precisely look at these semi-inclusive\nDIS processes; our study should help in the analysis of the forthcoming data.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank J.T.

In the case of semi-inclusive DIS, at LO\nand in collinear configuration, z coincides with the light-cone momentum fraction of\n+\nthe parent parton carried by the observed hadron, \u03be = p+\nh /pq . There are in general\nseveral other variables that can be considered; depending on the specific process\nunder study, they can be more or less suitable than z to, e.g., describe the process\nfrom the experimental point of view or to show scaling properties of observables, like\ncross-sections. In this Appendix, we shortly review the definition of these variables\nand give the connection among them. It is important to notice that at very large\nenergy scales E, when the mass of the observed hadron Mh can be safely neglected,\nall these variables coincide (excluding the regions where they are comparable to\nMh /E). However, kinematics for most of the running or forthcoming experiments\non semi-inclusive hadron production, which is the main subject of this paper, are\nsuch that mass corrections can be relevant. We always neglect corrections due to the\nmass of the proton target, even though they might have some effects in particular\nkinematical ranges.\nLet us first briefly summarize the situation in the case of e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u039b X process,\nwhich is used to fix the set of \u039b + \u039b\u0304 fragmentation functions largely adopted in this\npaper. The variables usually utilized are:\n2 ph * q\n2Eh\n= \u221a ,\n2\nQ\ns\n2 |p |\n2 |ph |\n= \u221ah ,\nxp =\nQ\ns\n+\nph\n,\n\u03be = +\npq\n\nxE =\n\n(54)\n\nwhere ph is the hadron three-momentum in the e+ e\u2212 c.m. reference frame. xE and\nxp are usually adopted by the experimentalists, while \u03be is more commonly used by\nthe theorists. At large energies, like in e+ e\u2212 collisions at the Z0 pole, and considering\n15\n\n\fxE > 0.1, which is also required for other theoretical reasons, see Ref. [4], mass effects\nare in fact negligible and all these variables can be safely assumed to be equivalent;\nthe fragmentation function dependence on \u03be can then be directly identified with\nthe xE dependence shown by the experimental results. When mass corrections are\nrelevant, the connection among the variables defined in Eqs. (54) is given, at leading\norder, as follows:\nxp = xE \u03b2 ,\n1+\u03b2\n,\n\u03be = xE\n2\n\n(55)\n\nwhere the factor \u03b2 is defined as\n4M 2\n1\u2212 2 h\nxE s\n\n\u03b2=\n\n!1/2\n\n*\n\n(56)\n\nLet us now consider the case of semi-inclusive DIS, in the virtual boson-target proton\nc.m. reference frame, for hadron production in the current fragmentation region\n(xF > 0). Usual variables are:\nEh + |ph |\np * ph\n=\n,\np*q\nW\n2 |ph |\n2 pL\n=\n,\n=\nW\nW\nEh\nEh\n2Eh\n=\n=\n=\n,\nEq\u2032\n(1 \u2212 x)Ep\nW\n\nz =\nxF\nz\u2032\n\n(57)\n\nwhere Eq\u2032 is the energy of the parent quark in the process q \u2032 \u2192 h + X. xF and\nz are the variables usually adopted by the experimentalists. However, as shown in\nRef. [4], the appropriate scaling variable for semi-inclusive DIS is z \u2032 rather than xF .\nDefining \u01eb = Mh /W , the ranges of variation of the three variables are\nxF \u2208\nz\u2032 \u2208\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0010\n\n0, 1 \u2212 4\u01eb2\n\nh\n\ni\n\n\u00111/2 \u0015\n\n,\n\n2\u01eb, 1 ,\n\u0014\n\u0011\no\u0015\n\u0010\n1n\n2 1/2\nz \u2208 \u01eb,\n.\n1 + 1 \u2212 4\u01eb\n2\nThe expressions of the three variables as a function of the other two are\nxF = z\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nz = xF\n\n\u01eb2\n1 \u2212 4 \u20322\nz\n\n!1/2\n\n\u01eb2\n1+4 2\nxF\n\uf8ee\n\n!1/2\n\n\u01eb2\n1\nz = xF \uf8f01 + 1 + 4 2\n2\nxF\n\n\u01eb2\nxF = z 1 \u2212 2\nz\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(59)\n\n\u01eb2\nz =z 1+ 2\nz\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(60)\n\n\u2032\n\n!1/2 \uf8f9\n\n\uf8ee\n\n1\n\u01eb2\nz = z \u2032 \uf8f01 + 1 \u2212 4 \u20322\n2\nz\n\n\uf8fb\n\n16\n\n(58)\n\n!1/2 \uf8f9\n\uf8fb\n\n.\n\n(61)\n\n\fIf we start from, e.g., a cross-section evaluated in our formalism (we omit here\nthe dependence on x and y)\nd\u03c3\n\u221d Dh (z) ,\n(62)\ndz\nthe corresponding cross-section expressed as a function of xF will be given by\nd\u03c3\ndz d\u03c3\n=\n\u221d Dh [z(xF )] ,\ndxF\ndxF dz\n\n(63)\n\nwhere, apart from the overall rescaling factor dz/dxF , one must keep into account\nthat fragmentation functions, obtained in the variable z, are to be rescaled to the z\nvalue corresponding to xF .\nIn variables like polarizations, given as ratios of two cross-sections, the overall\nrescaling factors cancel out and the remaining effect is the rescaling between the two\nvariables in the fragmentation functions, according to Eqs. (59)-(61).\nOf course, if the average value of the polarization over a given kinematical region\nis required, the appropriate overall rescaling factors, like dz/dxF in Eq. (63), have\nto be taken into account in the kinematical integrations.\n\n17\n\n\fReferences\n[1] M. Anselmino, M. Boglione, J. Hansson and F. Murgia, Phys. Rev. D54 (1996) 828\n[2] R.L. Jaffe, Phys.
