The data provide evidence for a two dimensional quantum superconductor\nto insulator (2D-QSI) transition. Here we explore the compatibility of this phase transition line\nwith Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) behavior and a 2D-QSI transition. In an intermediate\nregime, limited by a finite size effect, we uncover remarkable consistency with BKT- criticality, weak\nlocalization in the insulating state and non-Drude behavior in the normal state. Our estimates for\nthe critical exponents of the 2D-QSI-transition, z \u2243 1 and \u03bd \u2243 2/3, suggest that it belongs to the\n3D-xy universality class.\nPACS numbers: 74.78.-w, 74.40.+k, 74.90.+n, 74.78.Fk\n\nThe conducting interface between LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 ,\ntwo excellent band insulators, has been attracting a lot\nof attention[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Recently, two different ground\nstates, magnetic [6] and superconducting [7], have been\nexperimentally identified. In a very recent report [8], it\nwas shown that the electric field effect can be used to map\nthe phase diagram of this interface system. As the carrier density is increased the system undergoes a 2D-QSI\ntransition. A further increase reveals a superconducting\ndome. Moreover it was shown that the characteristics\nof the superconducting transition are consistent with a\nsuperconducting sheet of about 10 nm thick [9].\nHere we attempt to unravel the nature of the phase\ntransition line and its endpoint which separates the superconducting from the insulating ground state. For this\npurpose we explore the compatibility of the phase transition with Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) critical\nbehavior [10, 11] and of its endpoint, where superconductivity disappears, with a two dimensional quantum\nsuperconductor to insulator (2D-QSI) transition associated with weak localization [12]. In contrast to the disorder tuned QSI transition, electrostatic tuning changes the\ncarrier density without altering the disorder landscape\n[13]. In an intermediate temperature regime we uncover\nremarkable agreement with BKT-criticality in the superconductor to normal state transition, weak localization\nin the insulating phase, and non-Drude behavior in the\nnormal state. It is shown that both conduction mechanisms are limited by a finite size effect, whereupon the\nBKT-correlation length and the diverging length associated with weak localization [12] cannot grow beyond a\nlimiting length, set by the extent of the homogeneous\nregions. Our analysis also reveals that the electrostatic\ntuned BKT-phase transition line ends at a 2D-QSI critical point which appears to fall onto the universality class\nof the classical 3D-xy model. In addition we explore the\n\nTc dependence of the vortex core radius and the vortex\nenergy. These properties appear to be basic ingredients\nto understand the Tc variation.\nTo explore the compatibility with BKT critical behavior we invoke the characteristic temperature dependence\nof the correlation length above Tc [11],\n\u0011\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u03be = \u03be0 exp 2\u03c0/ bt1/2 , t = |T /Tc \u2212 1| ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03be0 is the classical vortex core radius and b is\nrelated to the energy needed to create a vortex [14,\n15, 16]. Note that b also enters the temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth \u03bb below\nthe\njump: \u03bb2 (Tc ) /\u03bb2 (T ) =\n\u0010 universal Nelson-Kosterlitz\n\u0011\n1/2\n\n1 + b |t| /4 [14]. Moreover, b is related to the vortex\nenergy Ec in terms of [16, 17]\nb = 4\u03c0Tc1/2 /bR = f (Ec / (kB Tc )) .\n\n(2)\n\nInvoking dynamic scaling the resistance R scales in D = 2\nas [18]\nR \u221d \u03be \u2212zcl ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere zcl is the dynamic critical exponent of the classical\ndynamics. zcl is usually not questioned to be anything\nbut the value that describes simple diffusion: zcl = 2 [19].\nCombining these scaling forms and taking the occurrence\nof a 2D-QSI transition at R0c = R0 (Tc = 0) into account\nwe obtain\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(4)\nR (T ) = R0 exp \u2212bR (T \u2212 Tc )\u22121/2 ,\nwith\nbR = 4\u03c0Tc1/2 /b, \u2206R0 = R0c \u2212 R0 \u221d 1/\u03be02 ,\n\n(5)\n\n\f2\nbecause \u2206R0 is the singular part of R0 close to the 2DQSI transition.

This\nregime corresponds to the horizontal line in the inset of\nFig. 1. If \u03be > L the scaling function approaches f (x) \u221d x\nso that R(T )/R0 tends to L\u22122 , the behavior indicated\nby the dashed line. In this context it should be recognized that the BKT correlation length does not exhibit\nthe usual and relatively slow algebraic divergence as Tc is\napproached (Eq. (1 )). For this reason the elimination of\nthe finite size effect would require unprecedented sample\nhomogeneity. The emerging agreement with BKT behavior, limited by a standard finite size effect, allows us to\ndiscriminate the rounded transition from other scenarios,\nincluding strong disorder which destroys the BKT behavior. It also provides the basis to estimate Tc , bR (Tc ) and\n\u22121/2\nR0 (Tc ), and with that b (Tc ) and \u03be0 \u221d \u2206R0\nwith reasonable accuracy.\nApplying this approach to the R (T ) data for each\ngate voltage Vg we obtain the BKT-transition line depicted in Fig. 2, displayed as Tc vs. R\u0003 (T \u2217 ), the normal state sheet resistance at T \u2217 = 0.4K. We observe\nthat it ends around R\u0003c \u2243 4.28 k\u03a9 where the system\nis expected to undergo a 2D-QSI transition because Tc\nvanishes. With reduced R\u0003 the transition temperature\nincreases and reaches its maximum value, Tcm \u2243 0.31 K,\naround R\u0003 \u2243 1.35 k\u03a9. With further reduced resistance\nTc decreases. To identify deviations from Drude behavior (\u03c3 \u221d n) in the normal state, which will be discussed\nlater, we also included the gate voltage dependence of the\nnormal state resistance.\nAccording to the scaling theory of quantum critical\nphenomena one expects that close to the 2D-QSI transition Tc scales as [18, 21]\n\n2\n\nT\n\nf (x). \u0010f (x) is the finite\n\u0011 size scaling function with\n\u22121/2\n/L2 \u221d \u03be 2 /L2 .

Fig. 3 also depicts the Tc dependence of b, which is related to the vortex energy. Since b\ntends to a constant in the limit Tc \u2192 0, Eq. (2) implies\ndb/dTc = 0 and therewith Ec (Tc ) \u221d kB Tc , while the vortex core radius \u03be0 diverges as \u03be0 (Tc ) \u221d 1/Tc, in analogy\nto the behavior of superfluid 4 He films [26]. The 2D-QSI\ntransition is then also characterized by an infinite vortex\ncore radius and vanishing vortex core energy. As Tc increases from the 2D-QSI transition, \u03be0 drops, while the\nvortex core energy increases. Finally, after passing the\nmaximum Tc the vortex core radius continues to decrease\nwith reduced Tc while b increases further.\nHaving presented the evidence for an electric field effect\ntuned BKT line ending at a 2D-QSI-transition belonging\n\n2.0\n\n1.9x10\n\n-4\n\n\u2217\n\nb\n\n50\n\n(k\n\n(Tc ) \u221d \u2206Vg2/3 \u221d\n\n100\n0.05\n\n(\n\n\u2206R0 (Tc ) = R0c \u2212 R0 (Tc ) \u221d \u03be0\u22122 (Tc ) \u221d \u03b4 2\u03bd \u221d Tc2/z ,\n(10)\nholds. Fig. 3 depicts the Tc dependence of \u03be0 (Tc ) \u221d\n(R0c \u2212 R0 (Tc ))\u22121/2 and b, which is related to the vortex\nenergy Ec (Eq. (2)). Approaching the 2D-QSI-transition\nwe observe that the data point to \u03be0 (Tc ) \u221d 1/Tc, yielding for z the estimate z \u2243 1 so that \u03bd\u0304 \u2243 2/3 with\nz \u03bd\u0304 \u2243 2/3. As these exponents satisfy the inequality\n(2 + z) \u03bd \u2265 2 [22] we identified the correct scaling argument, \u03b4 \u221d \u2206n2D \u221d \u2206Vg . From the gate voltage dependence of the normal state sheet resistance shown in\nFig. 2 it also follows that the normal state conductivity\n2/3\nscales as \u2206\u03c3\u0003 (T \u2217 ) = \u03c3\u0003 (T \u2217 ) \u2212 \u03c3\u0003c (T \u2217 ) \u221d \u2206Vg . The\n2D-QSI transition is then characterized by the scaling\nrelations\nTc \u221d \u03b4 2/3 \u221d \u2206R (T \u2217 ) \u221d\n\n150\n\nc\n\nwe obtain z\u03bd = 2/3 if \u2206Vg or \u2206n2D are taken as scaling\nargument \u03b4. To identify the correct scaling argument we\nuse the fact that \u03b4 \u221d \u2206n2D holds if (2 + z) \u03bd \u2265 2 [22]. To\ncheck this inequality, given z\u03bd, we need an estimate of z.\nFor this purpose we invoke relation (5), R0c \u2212 R0 (Tc ) \u221d\n\u03be0\u22122 (Tc ) (zcl = 2) which diverges as \u03be0 (Tc ) \u221d \u03be (T = 0) \u221d\n\u22121/z\n\u03b4 \u2212\u03bd\u0304 \u221d Tc\n, so that the scaling relation\n\n1/2\n\u2206R0\n\n0.10\n\n(\n\n(9)\n\n-R (T ) )\n\n\u2206Vg \u221d \u2206n2D \u221d Tc3/2 ,\n\n-1/2\n\n)\n\n200\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\nT (K)\n\nFIG. 4: \u03c3\u0003 vs. T and (\u03c3\u0003 (T ) \u2212 \u03c3\u00030 ) / (d ln(T )) vs. 1/ |ln(T )|\nat Vg = \u2212240 V from Caviglia et al.

The\n` solid\n \u0301 line is\n\u03c3\u0003 (T ) = \u03c3\u00030 + dln(T ) with \u03c3\u00030 = 1.2 * 10\u22124 \u03a9\u22121 and d =\n`\n \u0301\n1.2 * 10\u22125 \u03a9\u22121 , the dashed one (\u03c3\u0003 (T ) \u2212 \u03c3\u00030 ) / (d ln (T )) =\n1 and the dash-dot one (\u03c3\u0003 (T ) \u2212 \u03c3\u00030 ) /d = 1.8 \u221d 1/L.\nThe inset shows the magnetoconductivity \u03c3\u0003 vs. H, applied perpendicular to the interface, at T = 0.03 K and\nVg = \u2212300 V, from Caviglia et al. [8]. The solid line is\n\u03c3\u0003 = 4.51 * 10\u22122 + 1.12 * 10\u22122 ln (H) k\u03a9\u22121 .\n\nto the 3D-xy universality class and non-Drude behavior in the normal state an important issue remains, the\nnature of the insulating phase. Fig. 4 shows the temperature dependence of \u03c3\u0003 for Vg = \u2212240 V, which is rather\ndeep in the insulating phase [8] . In analogy to Fig. 1\nwe observe a rounded transition. In the present case\nthe intermediate regime is compatible with weak localization, \u03c3\u0003 (T ) = \u03c3\u00030 + d ln(T ) [12]. Given the evidence\nfor the limiting length L, which prevented the attainment of the superconducting ground state, one suspects\nthat it limits the growth of \u03beld \u221d R\u0003 = 1/\u03c3\u0003 , the di-\n\n\f4\nverging length associated with localization [12], as well.\nIn this case finite size scaling predicts that \u03c3\u0003 (T ) scales\nas (\u03c3\u0003 (T ) \u2212 \u03c3\u0003c ) / (d ln (T )) = g (y) with y = \u03beld /L \u221d\n1/ (L |ln (T )|). g(y) is the finite size scaling function and\ntends to 1 for y < 1. In this case the approach to the\ninsulating ground state can be seen, while for y > 1 the\ncrossover to g(y) \u2192 y sets in and \u03c3\u0003 (T ) approaches the\nfinite size dominated regime, where \u03c3\u0003 (T ) \u2212 \u03c3\u00030 \u221d 1/L.\nA glance at Fig. 4 reveals that weak localization combined with the finite size effect describes the data very\nwell. In addition, below Vg = \u2212300 V d is independent of Vg and its value d = 1.2 * 10\u22125 \u03a9\u22121 is close to\nde = e2 / (\u03c0h) \u2243 1.23*10\u22125 \u03a9\u22121 , generically attributed to\nelectron-electron interaction [27]. The resulting evidence\nfor weak localization is further substantiated by the observed negative magnetoresistance [8] and in particular\nby the high field behavior of the conductance depicted\nin the inset of Fig. 4. There we observe consistency\nwith the characteristic ln(H) high field behavior [12] and\nd\u03c3\u0003 /d ln (H) \u2243 1.12 * 10\u22125 \u03a9\u22121 is close to the theoretical prediction d\u03c3\u0003 /d ln (H) = e2 / (\u03c0h) \u2243 1.23 * 10\u22125 \u03a9\u22121\n[28]. As a result, the failure to observe the superconducting and insulating ground states directly, is attributable\nto a finite size effect, preventing the respective diverging\nlengths to grow beyond L. Nevertheless, the finite size\nscaling analysis and the high field magnetoconductivity\nprovide substantial evidence that these are the appropriate ground states in the homogenous and infinite system.\nIn summary, we have shown that the electrostatically\ntuned phase transition line at the LaAlO3 /SrTiO3 interface, observed by Caviglia et al. [8], is consistent with a\nBKT-line ending at a 2D-QSI critical point with critical\nexponents z \u2243 1 and \u03bd \u2243 2/3, so the universality class\nof the transition appears to be that of the classical 3Dxy model. The normal state was shown to exhibit nonDrude behavior. To identify the superconducting and insulating ground states from the temperature dependence\nof the resistance we performed a finite size scaling analysis because the growth of the finite temperature correlation length and the diverging length associated with\nlocalization turned out to be limited. Nevertheless, in\nthe insulating state we observed in both, the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the resistance, the\ncharacteristic weak localization behavior. Furthermore,\nwe explored the Tc dependence of the vortex core radius\nand the vortex energy. These properties appear to be\nbasic ingredients to unravel the nature of the variation\nof Tc . Approaching the 2D-QSI transition the vortex energy tends to zero while the vortex core radius and the\nlocalization length diverge so the system is an insulator.\n\nThis work was partially supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation through the National Center\nof Competence in Research, and \"Materials with Novel\nElectronic Properties, MaNEP\" and Division II.\n\n\u2217\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n\n[24]\n[25]\n[26]\n[27]\n[28]\n\nElectronic address: tschnei@physik.unizh.ch\nA.
