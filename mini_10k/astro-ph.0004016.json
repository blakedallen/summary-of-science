This paper examines quantitatively how the accuracy of anisotropy\nmeasurement depends on the number of arrival directions in a data set.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe origin of the highest energy cosmic rays is a problem that has persisted for 4 decades\nsince the pioneering measurements at Volcano Ranch [1, 2]. There is some consensus\nthat, above the spectrum's ankle at about 1018.5 eV, they originate outside the disk of\nthe Galaxy. For particles of such high magnetic rigidity, sources in the Galaxy's disk\nwould presumably cause an obvious anisotropy in arrival directions that is not observed.\nEvidence for a composition changing to lighter particles at the ankle [3] strengthens this\nargument (particles having even greater rigidity because of lesser charge) and supports\nthe view that cosmic rays with energies above the ankle are of extragalactic origin. The\nsources of those particles remain to be identified.\nThe observations of cosmic rays with energies above the expected GZK cutoff [4, 5]\nshould be a powerful clue to the nature of the sources. The Fly's Eye [6] and AGASA\n[7] measured air showers with energies well above the GZK threshold. Recent reports\n[8, 9, 10] suggest that the spectrum might continue without a strong GZK effect. These\nsuper-GZK results have posed several related, but distinguishable, puzzles:\n1. How are particles produced with such prodigious energy?\n1\n\n\f2. Why do the arrival directions of those particles not point back to recognizable\nsources in our local part of the universe?\n3. Why is the intensity of particles above 6 \u00d7 1019 eV not more strongly suppressed?\nNew attempts to improve the observational data include the recently commissioned\nHigh Resolution Fly's Eye (HiRes) [11], the Pierre Auger Observatory [12], the proposed Telescope Array Project [13], and Airwatch/OWL [14] plans for future space-based\ndetectors of atmospheric air showers. The Auger Observatory and the potential spacebased detectors will have exposure to the entire sky, which will open new possibilities for\nanisotropy analysis. These methods will be explored here in the context of the better\ncontrolled exposure of the Auger surface arrays.\nHillas [15] pointed out years ago that there are few astrophysical sites that can produce\na large enough \"electrical potential\" \u03b2BL to accelerate even highly charged nuclei to 1020\neV. (Here \u03b2 = v/c is the relative velocity of moving media with magnetic field strength\nB and size L. In the case of statistical acceleration, including Fermi shock acceleration,\nthe same product \u03b2BL governs the maximum particle rigidity even though particles do\nnot pass through a monotonic change in electrical potential.) Puzzle #1 is exacerbated\nin many contexts by synchrotron radiation and/or pion photoproduction.\nPuzzle #2 can be resolved by invoking stronger-than-expected extragalactic magnetic\nfields, but that does not readily simplify puzzle #3. The expected suppression of particles\nabove the GZK cutoff is based on travel time (or total distance traveled) rather than\nthe straight-line distance to the sources. Particles below the GZK threshold have been\naccumulating over billions of years, whereas the mean age of particles well above the\nthreshold cannot be greater than tens of millions of years [16].\nOne possible inference from the lack of an observable GZK spectral break is that subGZK particles may not be much older than 30 million years either, in which case the\nGZK effect would not significantly suppress the cosmic rays above the threshold relative\nto those below. It is not reasonable to suppose that the sources of high energy cosmic\nrays turned on so recently, so the young age of sub-GZK cosmic rays would require an\nintergalactic mechanism for dissipating their energy. Known mechanisms (e.g. nuclear\ninteractions, synchrotron radiation, e\u00b1 production, pion photoproduction via infrared\nand visible background photons, etc.) do not rob energy from sub-GZK particles rapidly\nenough. Perhaps high energy cosmic rays are attenuated through interactions with the\nunknown dark matter of the universe [17].\nMore conventional approaches to puzzle #3 are to defeat the GZK cutoff with a very\nhard extragalactic spectrum (e.g. from topological defect annihilation [18]) or to evade\nit by invoking neutrinos [19, 20] or non-standard particles [21, 22] that are immune to\nthe microwave background radiation. Others [23, 24] conclude that the sources must be\nlocalized to the Galaxy, but distributed in a halo large enough that galactic anisotropy\nhas not become obvious.\nThe cumulative cosmic ray observations at this time are not sufficient to sort out the\npossibilities. AGASA and HiRes are currently building up the world's total exposure at\nthe highest energies. With better statistics and better measurements, the observations\n2\n\n\fcould soon lead to a breakthrough that identifies the sources of the highest energy cosmic\nrays. This same hope has been expressed for decades through the course of numerous\nexperiments, however, and the puzzles have only become deeper mysteries. The answers\nmay not come easily, and we should prepare the best possible analyses of the energy\nspectrum, particle mass distribution, and arrival directions.\nCareful determinations of the energy spectrum and mass composition can be used to\nweed out classes of theories, but these tools are not likely to yield a clear signature for\npicking out a unique theory. A positive identification of the cosmic ray sources requires\nseeing their fingerprint in the sky. This may come in the form of arrival direction clusters\n[25, 26] that identify discrete sources, or it may come as a large-scale celestial pattern that\ncharacterizes a particular class of potential sources. In the worst case, we might discover\nthat the arrival directions are isotropic and the sources still elude positive identification.\nIn that case, observers must strive for the best possible upper limit on anisotropy.\nThe Auger Project's surface arrays will provide the best search for anisotropy fingerprints. Their combined exposure function on the celestial sphere will be unambiguous\nbecause they operate continuously and are not sensitive to atmospheric variability. Continuous operation means the celestial exposure function is uniform in right ascension.\nBy having observatories appropriately located in both the southern and northern hemispheres, the exposure does not vary strongly with declination either.\nThe methods described in this paper are applicable to any observatory with full-sky\ncoverage. They are not limited to the Auger Project, although the specific Auger site\nlocations are used in the example simulations that are reported here.\nCoverage of the full sky could be achieved piecemeal by combining results from different experiments. There is serious risk of spurious results from such meta-analyses,\nhowever, unless the exposures, energy resolutions, and detector systematics are perfectly\nunderstood and correctly incorporated in the analysis. The reliable approach is to use\nidentical detectors in both hemispheres or the same (orbiting) detector for both hemispheres.\nThis paper seeks to evaluate the sensitivity of a full-sky observatory to large-scale\nanisotropy patterns and how that sensitivity depends on the number of arrival directions\nin a data set. Large-angle fingerprinting will be needed if there are many contributing\nsources or if the flux from each single source is diffused over a large solid angle due to\nmagnetic deflection of the charged cosmic rays. If, instead, there are point sources to be\ndetected, then the advantage of a full-sky observatory is in mapping the entire celestial\nsphere with comparable sensitivity in all regions.\nFull-sky coverage is crucial for large-scale anisotropy analysis. It makes it possible to\ndo integrals over the sky, so the powerful tools of multipole moments and angular power\nspectra are available. With full sky coverage, cosmic ray anisotropy analysis will be similar to gamma ray burst anisotropy analysis. The numbers of events will be comparable,\nthe direction error boxes will be comparable, the exposure non-uniformities will be comparable, and in both cases events come from all parts of the sky. All of the techniques\nthat were employed to search for anisotropy in the BATSE data [27, 28] can be applied\nto a full-sky cosmic ray data set.\n3\n\n\fWith a cosmic ray detector in only one hemisphere, there is a solid angle hole in the\nsky where the detector has zero exposure despite the Earth's rotation. A zero-exposure\nhole makes it impossible to do integrals over the whole celestial sphere. No matter how\nmany events the detector collects overall, it will never determine any multipole moment.\nA single-hemisphere detector can test hypotheses like, \"Does the observed distribution\nmatch better what would be accepted from the clustering of radio galaxies toward the\nsupergalactic plane or what would be accepted from an isotropic distribution?\" It can\nalso make qualified measurements like, \"Assuming the anisotropy is a perfect quadrupole\nwith axial symmetry, fit for the axis orientation that best explains the observed celestial\ndistribution.\"\nThe role of an observatory, however, should be to map the sky and make results\navailable in a form which is readily usable without knowledge of the detector properties\nand which is independent of any theoretical hypothesis. Low-order multipole tensors (or\nspherical harmonic coefficients) can summarize the large-scale information. The angular\npower spectrum reveals if there is clumpiness on smaller scales. These results can be\ntabulated so that theorists can test arbitrary models quantitatively without privileged\naccess to the data. With approximately uniform exposure, even eyeball inspection of\narrival direction scatter plots can show large-scale patterns that are hidden when steep\nexposure gradients dominate the scatter plots.\nWhile the role of an observatory should be to map the sky and determine the patterns\nwithout preconceived expectations, it is nevertheless worthwhile to consider what might\nbe learned by measuring the low order multipoles or the angular power spectrum.\nMonopole. There is no information about anisotropy patterns in the monopole scalar\nby itself. It is simply the sky integral of the cosmic ray intensity. That is information\nalready present in the energy spectrum. A pure monopole intensity distribution is equivalent to isotropy. The strength of other multipoles relative to the monopole is a measure\nof anisotropy.\nDipole. A pure dipole distribution is not possible because the cosmic ray intensity\ncannot be negative in half of the sky. A \"pure dipole deviation from isotropy\" means a\nsuperposition of monopole and dipole, with the intensity everywhere \u2265 0.\nA predominantly dipole deviation from isotropy might be expected if the sources are\ndistributed in a halo around our Galaxy, as has been suggested [23, 24]. In this case, there\nis a definite prediction that the dipole vector should point toward the galactic center.\nAn approximate dipole deviation from isotropy could be caused by a single strong\nsource if magnetic diffusion or dispersion distributes those arrival directions over much of\nthe sky. In general, a single source would produce higher-order moments as well.\nA dipole moment is measurable in the microwave radiation due to Earth's motion\nrelative to the universal rest frame [29]. If we are moving relative to the cosmic ray rest\nframe, a dipole moment should exist also in the cosmic ray intensity (the Compton-Getting\neffect). At lower energies, this may occur if the sun and Earth are moving relative to the\ngalactic magnetic field or if the cosmic rays are not at rest with respect to the galactic\nfield. For extragalactic cosmic rays, a Compton-Getting dipole is expected if the Galaxy\n4\n\n\fis moving relative to the intergalactic field or if the cosmic rays themselves are streaming\n< 10\u22123 ),\nin intergalactic space. In any case, the expected velocities would be small (v/c \u223c\nImax \u2212Imin\n< 0.005.\nand the Compton Getting anisotropy [30] ( Imax +Imin = (\u03b3 + 2)(v/c)) should be \u223c\n(Here \u03b3 is the differential spectral index, which is roughly 3.) An anisotropy of one-half\npercent would require high statistics for detection (see section 3).\nA larger dipole anisotropy might be produced by a cosmic ray density gradient. If\nthe magnetic field is disorganized, the gradient produces streaming by diffusion and the\nCompton-Getting dipole vector is parallel to the density gradient. If there is a regular\n~ can be perpendicular to both the\nmagnetic field, however, the expected dipole vector D\n~ \u221d \u2207\u03c1\n~ \u00d7 B.\n~ The direction of strongest intensity\ngradient and the field direction, D\ncorresponds to the arrival direction of particles whose orbit centers are located in the\ndirection of increased density.\nQuadrupole. An equatorial excess in galactic coordinates or supergalactic coordinates\nwould show up as a prominent quadrupole moment. A measurable quadrupole is expected\nin many scenarios of cosmic ray origins, and is perhaps to be regarded as the most likely\nresult of a sensitive anisotropy search.\nIn general, a quadrupole tensor is characterized by 3 relative eigenvalues with associated orthogonal eigenvectors. In the case of axial symmetry, there is a single nondegenerate eigenvector that gives the symmetry axis. An axisymmetric \"prolate\" distribution would be hot spots at antipodal points of the sky, whereas an \"oblate\" distribution\nhas the excess concentrated toward the equator that is perpendicular to the symmetry\naxis.\nThe axis of an oblate quadrupole distribution might differ from the galactic axis or\nthe supergalactic axis if we are embedded in a magnetic field that systematically rotates\nthe arrival directions.\nThe angular power spectrum. Spherical harmonic coefficients for a function on a sphere\nare the analogue of Fourier coefficients for a function on a plane. Variations on an angular\nscale of \u03b8 radians contribute amplitude in the l = 1/\u03b8 modes just as variations of a plane\nfunction on a distance scale of \u03bb contribute amplitude to the Fourier coefficients with\nk = 2\u03c0/\u03bb.\nFor cosmic ray anisotropy, we might look for power in modes from l = 1 (dipole)\nout to l \u223c 60, higher order modes being irrelevant because the detector will smear out\nany true variations on scales that are smaller than its angular resolution. For charged\ncosmic rays, magnetic dispersion will presumably smear out any point source more than\nthe detector's resolution function. Even at the highest observed particle energies, there is\nunlikely to be any structure in the pattern of arrival directions over angles smaller than\n< 20.\n3\u25e6 . The interesting angular power spectrum is therefore probably limited to l \u223c\n\n5\n\n\f2\n\nExposure\n\nFor a cosmic ray observatory, exposure is a function on the celestial sphere. Measured\nin units km2 * yr, it gives the observatory's time-integrated effective collecting area for a\nflux from each sky position. In this paper, the relative exposure \u03c9 is usually the function\nof interest. That will be a dimensionless function on the sphere whose maximum value is\n1. In other words, \u03c9 at any point of the sky is a fraction between 0 and 1 given by the\nexposure at that point divided by the largest exposure on the sky.\nIn other contexts, the term \"exposure\" refers to the total exposure integrated over the\ncelestial sphere. It then has units km2 * sr * yr. For example, in determining the cosmic\nray energy spectrum, one divides the number of cosmic rays observed in each energy bin\nby the total exposure for that energy. (In general, an observatory's exposure is energy\ndependent.) If there were evidence that the energy spectrum were not uniform over the\nsky, then we would need to use the exposure's dependence on celestial position to map\nthe spectrum over the sky.\nSince the spectrum is defined by the number of observed events divided by total\nexposure, one can use the measured spectrum to get the expected number of cosmic rays\nfor any given total exposure. In the case of the Auger surface arrays, the continuous\nacceptance is approximately 14, 000 km2 sr, independent of energy above 1019 eV. After\noperating for 5 years, they will have a total exposure of 70, 000 km2 * sr * yr. The integral\ncosmic ray intensity above 1019 eV is approximately 0.5/(km2 * sr * yr), and it falls roughly\nlike E \u22122 (perhaps less rapidly, but the energy dependence is not well determined above\n6 \u00d7 1019 eV.) Using this simple E \u22122 dependence gives the following estimates for Auger\ncosmic ray counts after 5 years:\n\u2022 35,000 above 1019 eV (believed to be mostly extragalactic)\n\u2022 2200 above 4 \u00d7 1019 eV (compared to 47 in the AGASA cluster analysis)\n\u2022 350 above 1020 eV (above the GZK threshold region)\n\u2022 35 above 3.2 \u00d7 1020 eV (highest energy measured so far)\nHow any number of detected cosmic rays are distributed on the sky depends on both\nthe true celestial anisotropy and the observatory's relative exposure \u03c9.\nThe relative exposure can be calculated as follows for a detector at a single site with\ncontinuous operation. Full-time operation means that there is no exposure variation in\nsidereal time and therefore constant exposure in right ascension. Suppose the detector\nis at latitude a0 and that it is fully efficient for particles arriving with zenith angles \u03b8\nless than some maximum value \u03b8m . (Full efficiency means the zenith angle acceptance\ndepends on zenith angle only due to the reduction in the perpendicular area given by\ncos(\u03b8).) This results in the following dependence on declination \u03b4:\n\u03c9(\u03b4) \u221d cos(a0 )cos(\u03b4)sin(\u03b1m ) + \u03b1m sin(a0 )sin(\u03b4),\n6\n\n\fwhere \u03b1m is given by\n\u03b1m =\nand\n\u03be\u2261\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\n0\nif \u03be > 1\n\u03c0\nif \u03be < \u22121\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\ncos\u22121 (\u03be) otherwise\n\ncos(\u03b8m ) \u2212 sin(a0 )sin(\u03b4)\n.\ncos(a0 )cos(\u03b4)\n\nThe upper left plot of figure 1 shows the resulting declination dependence for a site\nat a0 = \u221235\u25e6 and another site at a0 = +39\u25e6, which are the latitudes for the two Auger\nobservatories. The detectors are assumed to be fully efficient out to \u03b8m = 60\u25e6 , and no\narrival directions are counted from larger zenith angles. The combined exposure is also\nshown. The maximum is at the north pole direction, which is always detectable at the\nnorthern site, although the effective detector area is reduced by cos(51\u25e6 ) for flux arriving\nfrom the north pole direction.\nThe lower plots in figure 1 are scatter plots of the accepted cosmic rays for each site,\nwhere directions have been sampled from an isotropic distribution but accepted according\nto each detector's exposure. (A sampled cosmic ray direction is accepted if a randomly\nsampled number between 0 and 1 is less than the relative exposure \u03c9 for that direction.)\nThere are 10,000 accepted arrival directions in each of those two plots. Shown in the\nupper right plot is the superposition of all 20,000 events from the combined observatory.\nThe combined distribution is not uniform, but has the modest declination dependence\nindicated in the upper left plot.\n\n3\n\nDipole sensitivity\n\nThe objective here is to study the sensitivity of a full-sky observatory to a dipole deviation\nfrom isotropy. How well can the dipole be measured? How does that accuracy depend on\nthe number of arrival directions in the data set? How does it depend on the amplitude of\nthe dipole anisotropy?\nFor a dipole deviation from isotropy, the cosmic ray intensity varies over the sky as\nI(~u) =\n\nN\n~ * ~u).\n(1 + \u03b1D\n4\u03c0\n\nN\n~ is the\nHere ~u is a unit vector defining the celestial direction, 4\u03c0\nis the average intensity, D\ndipole direction unit vector, and \u03b1 is its (non-negative) amplitude. In order for the cosmic\nray intensity to be nowhere negative, \u03b1 must lie in the range 0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 1. The amplitude\n\u03b1 gives the customary measure of anisotropy amplitude: \u03b1 = (Imax \u2212 Imin )/(Imax + Imin ).\nThe dipole can be recovered from the celestial intensity function by\n\n~ = 3\n\u03b1D\nN\n\nZ\n\n7\n\nI(~u) ~u d\u03a9.\n\n\fFigure 1: The upper left plot shows the declination dependence of the Auger Observatory's\nrelative exposure. The southern and northern sites are indicated separately by dots. The\ncombined exposure function is marked with filled circles. The scatter plot in the upper\nright results from sampling an isotropic distribution and applying this Auger acceptance.\nThere are 20,000 directions plotted, 10,000 from the southern site (shown separately in\nthe lower left plot) and 10,000 from the northern site (lower right).\n\n8\n\n\fIn our case, the observed intensity function consists of N discrete arrival directions, each\nassociated with a relative exposure \u03c9i . The components of the dipole vector are then\nestimated by\nN\n1 (i)\n3 X\nu ,\n\u03b1Da =\nN i=1 \u03c9i a\nwhere ua(i) denotes a component of the ith vector, and N is the simple sum of the N\nweights \u03c91i . (These dipole components are linear combinations of the three spherical\nharmonic coefficients with l = 1.)\nTo test this method's sensitivity to a dipole of amplitude \u03b1 when there are N directions\nin the data set, one can produce an ensemble of artificial data sets of this type (with\n~ For each data set, use the above formula to estimate the\nrandom dipole directions D).\ndipole vector, and record the difference of the estimated \u03b1 from the input alpha and also\nthe angle between the estimated direction and the input dipole direction. These error\ndistributions describe the measurement accuracy. The RMS deviation from the true \u03b1\nis a single number to characterize the amplitude measurement accuracy, and the average\nspace angle error summarizes the accuracy of determining the dipole direction.\nThis procedure can be repeated for different values of N and different values of \u03b1. For\nany pair (N, \u03b1) the ensemble of simulation data sets yields the amplitude resolution and\ndirection resolution as above.\nTo generate an individual simulation data set, one samples N arrival directions on the\ncelestial sphere. First, a direction is sampled from the assumed celestial distribution with\ndipole deviation from isotropy. Then the detector acceptance is applied by rejecting the\nsampled direction if a random number is greater than the relative exposure \u03c9 for that\ndirection. This continues until the data set has N arrival directions. The data set then\nreflects both the presumed celestial anisotropy and the detector's non-uniform exposure.\nThese methods yield the results summarized in figure 2. The number of arrival directions was increased by factors of two: N = 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000, 16000,\n32000. For each N, amplitudes were studied at \u03b1 = 0.1, 0.2,..., 1.0.\nThe upper left plot of figure 2 shows that the amplitude is determined to an accuracy\nof about 0.1 with 250 directions, improving to approximately 0.01 with 32,000 directions.\nThe upper right plot shows the dipole direction resolution as a function of the number\nof arrival directions. The mean error is less than 10 degrees for all cases (250 directions\nor more) if the amplitude is nearly 1, and it is less than 10 degrees regardless of the\namplitude if the number of directions is 16,000 or more.\nThe lower left plot shows that the mean dipole direction error decreases as the dipole\namplitude increases. A strong amplitude yields a good direction determination even for a\nsmall number of directions in the data set. For example, with only 250 cosmic ray arrival\ndirections, the dipole direction is determined to better than 20 degrees if the amplitude\nexceeds 0.5. To get that same resolution with \u03b1=0.1, you need a data set with more than\n4000 directions.\nFor a fixed number of arrival directions, the RMS error in the amplitude has little\ndependence on the amplitude. That is to say, you can distinguish amplitudes 0.85 and 0.90\n9\n\n\fFigure 2: Four plots that indicate how the sensitivity to dipole anisotropy depends on\nthe number of arrival directions N in the data set and the anisotropy amplitude \u03b1. In\nthe upper plots, the abscissa is the number of directions N. The left plot shows the RMS\nerror in estimating the amplitude: the right plot shows the mean error in the measured\ndipole direction. Each column of points represent different amplitudes from 0.1 to 1.0.\nThe open circle is \u03b1 = 0.1 and the + mark is \u03b1 = 1.0. In the lower figures, the abscissa\nis amplitude \u03b1 and the different points above each value represent different values of N\n(increasing by factors of 2). The open circle is N = 250, and\u221athe + is N = 32, 000.\nMultiplying the ordinate of a point in the lower right figure by N gives the number of\nsigmas deviation from isotropy. Each point is derived from an ensemble of 100 data sets.\n\n10\n\n\fas well as you can distinguish 0.10 and 0.15. For the purpose of detecting an anisotropy\n(as opposed to measuring it), the relevant quantity is the amplitude divided by the RMS\nerror, which is the number of sigmas deviation from isotropy. That quantity\n\u221a increases\nwith the amplitude \u03b1. It can also be expected to increase in proportion to N as the\nnumber of arrival directions increases. The lower right plot shows that\n\u221a\n\u03b1\n\u2248 0.65 \u03b1 N .\n\u2206\u03b1\nFor N=250, for example, the deviation from isotropy increases from 1-sigma to 10-sigma\nas \u03b1 increases from 0.1 to 1.0. For N=8000, the range is from 6-sigma to 60-sigma. Etc.\nTo achieve a 5-sigma detection of a Compton-Getting anisotropy amplitude of 0.005\nwould require 2.4 million arrival directions. An anisotropy amplitude of 0.2 from a galactic\nhalo distribution of sources, however, could be detected at the 5-sigma level with 1500\narrival directions.\n\n4\n\nQuadrupole sensitivity\n\nA quadruople deviation from isotropy is characterized by an intensity function on the\ncelestial sphere given by\nI(~u) = Q(~u, ~u),\nwhere ~u is an arbitrary direction unit vector and Q is a symmetric 2nd order tensor. Its\ntrace gives the monopole moment. Its other 5 independent components in any coordinate\nbasis are determined from the l = 2 spherical harmonic coefficients a2m .\nDenoting by \u03bei the three eigenvalues of Q and the three (unit) eigenvectors by q~i , the\nintensity function has the form\nI(~u) = \u03be1 (~\nq1 * ~u)2 + \u03be2 (~\nq2 * ~u)2 + \u03be3 (~\nq3 * ~u)2 .\nTo keep the number of studied variables manageable, consideration will be limited to axisymmetric oblate intensity functions, as might be expected from sources in the galactic\ndisk or near the supergalactic plane. Let ~q denote the eigenvector that defines the symmetry axis, and let \u03be be the ratio of its eigenvalue to those in the symmetry plane, so the\nintensity function on the sphere is of the form\nI(~u) \u221d \u03be (~q * ~u)2 + (~u\u22a5 * ~u\u22a5 ),\nwhere ~u\u22a5 \u2261 ~u \u2212(~u *~q)~q is the part of ~u perpendicular to the symmetry axis, and 0 \u2264 \u03be \u2264 1.\nThe anisotropy amplitude \u03b1 is related to \u03be by\n\u03b1\u2261\n\nImax \u2212 Imin\n1\u2212\u03be\n=\nImax + Imin\n1+\u03be\n\n\u21d4\n\n\u03be=\n\n1\u2212\u03b1\n.\n1+\u03b1\n\nThe objective here is to test how accurately the anisotropy amplitude \u03b1 and the\nsymmetry axis direction ~q can be determined from a data set of arrival directions. How\ndoes the accuracy depend on the number of directions N and on the amplitude \u03b1?\n11\n\n\fThe method of investigation is the same as for the dipole sensitivity study. For each\npair (N,\u03b1), an ensemble of simulation data sets are produced, each with a randomly chosen\ndirection for its symmetry axis. For each data set, the arrival directions are sampled from\nthe relative intensity function (with quadrupole anisotropy), and each direction is accepted\nwith probability equal to the relative exposure \u03c9 evaluated at that direction.\nThe anisotropy amplitude \u03b1 and symmetry axis direction ~q are estimated for each\nsimulation data set. The tensor with components\nSab \u2261\n\nZ\n\nI ua ub d\u03a9\n\n(ua denoting a component of ~u) has the same eigenvectors as Qab and the components Sab\ncan be estimated by\nN\n1 X\n1 (i) (i)\nSab =\nu u .\nN i=1 \u03c9i a b\n\nThe eigenvectors and eigenvalues of this symmetric matrix are then found. The symmetry\naxis is taken to be defined by the eigenvector with the smallest eigenvalue. Let \u2206 be that\nsmallest eigenvalue subtracted from the average of the other two (which should be equal,\ncorresponding to directions in the symmetry plane). The eigenvalue \u03be of the intensity\ntensor Q is given in terms of \u2206 by\n\u03be=\n\n2 \u2212 10\u2206\n.\n2 + 5\u2206\n\n.\nThen the anisotropy amplitude \u03b1 is gotten by \u03b1 = 1\u2212\u03be\n1+\u03be\nResults for ensembles with different (N, \u03b1) values are presented in figure 3 in complete\nanalogy with the dipole results presented in figure 2. The RMS error in the amplitude\nand the average space-angle error in the direction of the symmetry axis both decrease as\nN increases. The symmetry axis is also seen to be better determined as the anisotropy\namplitude increases for any fixed number of arrival directions N. The sensitivity for\ndetecting anisotropy, as shown in the lower right plot, is given by\n\u221a\n\u03b1\n\u2248 0.45 \u03b1 N .\n\u2206\u03b1\n\u2212Imin\n, detecting a quadrupole\nWith the definition of anisotropy amplitude \u03b1 \u2261 IImax\nmax +Imin\nanisotropy requires more data than for a dipole anisotropy of the same amplitude. Twice\nas many cosmic ray arrival directions ((.65/.45)2 \u2248 2) are needed for the same resolution.\n\n5\n\nSpherical harmonics\n\nFor any data set of arrival directions (with full-sky exposure), the anisotropy patterns can\nbe fully characterized by the set of spherical harmonic coefficients alm , in terms of which\nthe intensity function over the sphere is given by\nI(\u03b8, \u03c6) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nl\nX\n\nl=1 m=\u2212l\n\n12\n\nalm Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6).\n\n\fFigure 3: Similar to figure 2 for dipole sensitivity, the plots in this figure indicate how sensitivity to quadrupole anisotropy depends on the size of the data set N and the anisotropy\namplitude \u03b1. Symbol definitions \u221a\nare the same as in figure 2. Multiplying the ordinate of\na point in the lower right plot by N gives the number of sigmas deviation from isotropy.\nEach point is derived from an ensemble of 100 data sets.\n\n13\n\n\fThe coefficients alm are given by\nalm =\n\nZ\n\nI(\u03b8, \u03c6) Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6) d\u03a9.\n\nReal-valued spherical harmonics are used in this paper, so the coefficients are real.

There are certainly selection effects in these directions, but they are used\nhere only as an example of an anisotropic celestial distribution. The spherical harmonic\ncoefficients alm for this distribution are plotted to the right of that scatter plot. There\nare 440 coefficients plotted for 1 \u2264 l \u2264 20. Each set of 2l + 1 coefficients is plotted for\neach l over an interval of 0.4 units on the abscissa. These alm constitute a \"fingerprint\"\nof the anisotropy. They define a celestial intensity function that is a smoothed version of\nthe scatter plot. The prominent coefficients a11 and a22 in this example result from the\nstrong excess of the Virgo Cluster seen in the left central part of the scatter plot. Virgo\nis at declination 12.7 degrees and right ascension 187 degrees, and the alm coefficients\nare derived here using that equatorial coordinate system (not the plotted supergalactic\ncoordinate system).\nTo illustrate how well the alm coefficients characterize the anisotropy, arrival directions\ncan be sampled from the intensity function that they define. The lower left plot is a scatter\nplot with the same number of directions (2921) based on the relative intensity function\nI=\n\n20 X\nl\nX\n\nalm Ylm .\n\nl=1 m=\u2212l\n\nThe Auger exposure function has also been imposed. The lower left plot should not be\nidentical to the upper left plot because of the Auger exposure simulation as well as the\nrandom sampling from the smoothed celestial anisotropy function. It clearly does have\nthe same primary features, however.\n14\n\n\fFigure 4: This figure indicates how anisotropy in arrival directions is characterized by\nspherical harmonic coefficients alm . The upper left plot is 2921 directions to extragalactic\ninfrared sources. The upper right plot shows the spherical harmonic coefficients out to\nl = 20 (using the equatorial coordinate basis). The lower left scatter plot shows arrival\ndirections sampled from the smoothed celestial intensity function defined by those alm\ncoefficients (with the Auger exposure also imposed). Plotted at the lower right are the\nRMS differences between alm coefficients derived from such sample simulations and those\nshown at the upper right. Open circles in the lower right correspond to a simulation\nwith 250 sampled directions, asterisks to 1000 sampled directions, and the filled circles\ncorrespond to the simulation shown in the lower left with 2921 sampled arrival directions.\n\n15\n\n\fThe lower right plot in figure 4 summarizes how well the anisotropy is determined this\nway as a function of the number of arrival directions. The filled circles in that plot correspond to the displayed scatter plot with 2921 arrival directions. The alm coefficients were\nderived from that simulation data set (using the relative exposure weights) and compared\nwith those derived from the infrared source distribution. For each l, the RMS difference\nin the alm values is plotted. One can see that the typical error in alm is small compared\nto the significant coefficients in the upper right plot that characterize the anisotropy. The\nasterisks in the lower right plot are derived in the same way using a simulation with 1000\narrival directions. The open circles are the RMS coefficient differences resulting from a\nsimulation with just 250 sampled arrival directions. The anisotropy fingerprint in this\nexample is still measurable\n\u221a with 250 directions, although the RMS uncertainty in the alm\ncoefficients grows as 1/ N as N decreases.\n\n6\n\nThe angular power spectrum\n\nThe angular power spectrum is the average a2lm as a function of l:\nC(l) =\n\nl\nX\n1\na2 .\n2l + 1 m=\u2212l lm\n\nThe power in mode l is sensitive to variations over angular scales near 1/l radians. The\nangular power spectrum provides a quick and sensitive method to test for anisotropy and\nto determine its magnitude and characteristic angular scale(s).\nAs an example, consider the distribution of galaxies shown in the upper left plot of\nfigure 5. These are all galaxies with redshift z < 0.01 (also obtained from NED), and\nthey are plotted in the supergalactic coordinate system. The Virgo cluster is the highest\ndensity region toward the left in this plot. There are 7321 galaxy positions plotted. The\nangular power spectrum (with no exposure correction) is shown out to l = 20 in the upper\nright plot of that figure. There is excess power at all l-values, but especially for the dipole\nand quadrupole moments (l = 1, 2) due to the high intensity from Virgo and other parts\nof the supergalactic plane.\nThe lower left plot in figure 5 indicates how sensitivity to the power spectrum is\naffected by the number of arrival directions (with non-uniform exposure as is expected for\nthe Auger Observatory). Open circles in that plot are the power spectrum derived using\na data set of 250 arrival directions. Those directions were obtained by randomly sampling\nfrom the 7321 galaxy directions (without replacement) and rejecting a sampled direction\nif a random number between 0 and 1 fell above the relative exposure \u03c9 evaluated at\nthat direction. The 250 directions therefore represent a simulation Auger data set if each\ngalaxy direction were to have equal probability of being a cosmic ray arrival direction. The\nopen circles in the lower left plot are a decent approximation to the power spectrum (filled\ncircles) of the \"true\" power spectrum defined by all 7321 directions with uniform exposure.\nThe triangles in that plot represent the power spectrum for 1000 arrival directions sampled\nin the same way from the 7321, and the squares are obtained from 4000 sampled with the\n16\n\n\fFigure 5: The upper left plot shows the celestial distribution of 7321 galaxy directions with\nz < .01 in supergalactic coordinates. The upper right plot is the power spectrum obtained\nusing uniform exposure. The lower left plot compares this same power spectrum (filled\ncircles) with power spectra obtained from simulation data sets of non-uniform exposure\nand reduced numbers of directions. Open circles result from a data set of 250 directions\nsampled from the galaxy distribution with the Auger relative exposure. The triangles\npertain to a data set with 1000 directions, and squares to 4000 directions. The lower\nright plot shows the expected power resulting from the same type of finite sampling from\nan isotropic intensity. The symbols are the same as in the lower left plot, with asterisks\nrepresenting a data set of 16,000 sampled directions.\n\n17\n\n\fAuger exposure. It is clear that the approximation to the true power spectrum improves\nas the data set gets richer, but the gross information is already present with 250 arrival\ndirections.\nThe lower right plot of figure 5 indicates how much power is expected due to fluctuations when directions are sampled from an isotropic intensity (and biased for the\nnon-uniform expousre). The power is the same for all l-values and decreases like 1/N as\nthe number of arrival directions increases. The power spectrum of the galaxy distribution\nis well above this noise level for all l-values for the cases N = 4000 or 16,000. For 250\ndirections, only the first prominent harmonics in the lower left plot are clearly above the\nnoise level indicated in the lower right plot.\nAny class of candidate objects (e.g. active galaxies, or active galaxies with giant\nradio hot spots) has a celestial distribution that can be compared with a cosmic ray\nmap when the whole sky has been surveyed with adequate sensitivity. Full information\nabout the celestial distribution is provided by the set of coefficients alm . They can be\ntabulated out to l = 20 in a list of 441 numbers (including the monopole). The angular\npower spectrum is a coordinate-independent gross summary of the features present in the\ncelestial distribution. For example, you may learn from it that there is a large quadrupole\nmoment, but you do not learn if the quadrupole has axial symmetry or the orientations\nof its principal axes. Full anisotropy information is given by the 441 alm coefficients, not\nthe 20 C(l) powers.\nThe magnitude of the angular power C(l) for larger l-values may contain useful information in the case that cosmic rays come from a limited number of discrete sources.\nThe solid angle extent of the typical source affects the power at large values of l. Figure\n6 displays an example in which there are 50 sources of equal flux with positions sampled\nrandomly on the sky. Three different sky plots are shown, corresponding to different hypotheses about how much the arrival directions are dispersed from the source direction.\nIn the upper left plot, sampled arrival directions are accepted only if they lie within 10\u25e6\nof one of the sources. In the upper right plot, they are accepted only within 5 degrees of\na source, and only within 1.5 degrees in the lower left plot. The graph in the lower right\nshows the power spectra for the three different simulations. The power at low l-values\n> 10,\nis governed by the chance pattern in the distribution of source positions. For l \u223c\nhowever, the power clearly increases as the amount of source smearing decreases. The\nhigh end of the measurable angular power spectrum is sensitive to anisotropy structure\non that finer scale.\n\n7\n\nDiscussion\n\nThere is great advantage in a cosmic ray observatory having exposure to the entire celestial\nsphere, especially if the relative exposure is nearly uniform. In that case, scatter plots\nof arrival directions are immediately interpretable, and eyeball evaluations can readily\nidentify discrete sources or large-scale patterns. Discrete sources will be identified with\nequal sensitivity anywhere in the sky. If no such sources are found, the flux upper limits\n18\n\n\fFigure 6: This study explores how the angular power spectrum from a set of discrete\nsources should change with the amount of smearing by magnetic dispersion. Fifty hypothetical source positions were sampled isotropically. A set of 4000 arrival directions were\nthen sampled. An arrival direction was accepted if it were within an angular distance\n\u03b8 of any source (and was subjected to possible exclusion in accordance with Auger nonuniform exposure). Results for three different values of \u03b8 are shown: \u03b8 = 10\u25e6 in the upper\nleft, \u03b8 = 5\u25e6 in the upper right, and \u03b8 = 1.5\u25e6 in the lower left. Power spectra for the three\ncases are shown in the graph at the lower right (open circles for \u03b8 = 10\u25e6 , asterisks for\n\u03b8 = 5\u25e6 , and filled circles for \u03b8 = 1.5\u25e6 .\n\n19\n\n\fwill be uniform over the sky.\nAt the highest energies there is no proven anisotropy. Unlike the COBE anisotropy\nanalysis, it is not necessary to subtract a large known dipole pattern and a myriad of\nuninteresting foreground sources. Any cosmic ray deviations from isotropy will be of\nimmediate interest. The search for cosmic ray anisotropy is more similar to the case of\ngamma-ray bursts, where expectations and early claims of anisotropy were not supported\nby additional data.\nThe role of an observatory is to map the sky and make the results available to the scientific community. This is highly challenging for an observatory without full-sky coverage.\nMeasurements in that case are made with different sensitivity in different parts of the sky,\nand nothing at all can be said about a large hole where the exposure is zero. Certainly\nit is not possible to perform the full-sky integrations that are required to measure the\nmultipoles of the celestial cosmic ray intensity. In this paper, frequent use is made of the\ninverse of the relative exposure, 1/\u03c9. Such methods obviously fail if the relative exposure\nanywhere becomes infinitesimal or zero.\nTo underscore the difficulty of anisotropy analysis without full-sky coverage, one can\ncite the work by Wdowczyk and Wolfendale [32]. In that paper, the authors argue that\nthe cosmic ray intensity measurements support a model of excess arrivals from equatorial\ngalactic latitudes. The argument is based on the same data that two experimental groups\nhad previously used in support of a gradient in galactic latitude that suggested an excess\nfrom southern latitudes relative to northern latitudes. In effect, because those northern\ndetectors had poor exposure for southern galactic latitudes, Wdowczyk and Wolfendale\nwere able to argue that the data supported a quadrupole distribution rather than a dipole\ndistribution. Neither a dipole moment nor a quadrupole moment can be measured without\nfull-sky coverage.\nThe techniques outlined in this paper pertain to any full-sky detector. Non-uniformity\nin celestial exposure is not hard to handle, provided it is well determined and there is\nadequate exposure to all parts of the sky. The true cosmic ray intensity is mapped with\na sensitivity that depends primarily on the total number of detected arrival directions.\nThis number N is related to particle energy and observing time for any detector of known\nacceptance. This relationship for the Auger Observatory was given in the Introduction.\nWhile complete information about anisotropy is encoded in the alm coefficients (tied\nto some specified coordinate system), important gross properties of the anisotropy are\ncharacterized by the (coordinate independent) angular power spectrum C(l). One can\ntell, for example, if there is a strong dipole or quadrupole moment. Such large-scale patterns are expected in many theories. It should be noted, however, that C(1) gives the\ndipole moment but not its direction. It is obviously important whether the dipole points\ntoward the galactic center, toward Virgo, toward Cen A, or in some unexpected direction.\nSimilarly, all components of the quadrupole tensor are of interest, not just the average\nof their squares, C(2). Nevertheless, the angular power spectrum provides a powerful\ntool for discriminating between viable and non-viable theories without detailed investigation. Also, the higher-order moments of the angular power spectrum can quantitatively\ncharacterize whatever clumpiness may exist in a map of arrival directions.\n20\n\n\fThe techniques and examples mentioned in this paper are only representative of the\npowerful analysis methods that become possible with full-sky observatories. Data sets\nfrom such observatories will open a rich field of anisotropy study. The primary goal seen\nfrom the present time is the discovery of the highest energy cosmic ray origins. If that\nobjective is accomplished (perhaps even before full-sky data sets are available), then the\nobserved patterns from a known source distribution will be analyzed to infer properties\nof magnetic fields in the galactic halo and in intergalactic space.\nA full-sky observatory has the ability to summarize completely the anisotropy information with the use of the spherical harmonic expansion coefficients alm . A table of\ncoefficients (perhaps with multiple columns for different energy cuts) will provide the\nwhole story. As has been done in this paper, those coefficients will be reliably corrected\nfor the observatory's non-uniform exposure. Detailed anisotropy analysis will no longer\nrequire privileged access to detector data. The published anisotropy fingerprint encoded\nin the alm spherical harmonic coefficients can be matched against any theoretical suspect\nby any interested investigator.\n\nAcknowledgement.
