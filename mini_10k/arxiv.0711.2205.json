In\nour model, the system of N = 2M atomic sites of the ring is assumed to be partitioned into M pairs\nof nearest-neighbour sites (dimers). While the individual atomic site energies are assumed to be\nidentically distributed gaussian variables with autocorrelation parameter \u03b520 , the dimer site energies\nare chosen to be correlated with a gaussian strength \u03b12 < \u03b520 . For this system we obtain the exact\nflux-dependent energy levels to second order in the random site energies, using an earlier exact\ntransfer matrix perturbation theory. These results are used to study the mean persistent current\ngenerated by Ne \u2264 N spinless electrons occupying the Ne lowest levels of the flux-dependent energy\nband at zero temperature. Detailed analyzes are carried out in the case of low filling of the energy\nband (1 \u226a Ne \u226a N ) and for a half-filled band (Ne = N/2), for magnetic fluxes \u22121/2 < \u03c6/\u03c60 < 1/2.\nIn the half-filled band case, the uncorrelated part of the disorder reduces the persistent current\nwhile the correlated part enhances it, in such a way that for \u03b12 < \u03b520 /2 the current decreases with\nthe disorder, while for \u03b12 > \u03b520 /2 it increases with it. Also, while showing a specific dependence\non the flux, the disorder effect has the same dependence on the parity of Ne as the pure system\nfree electron current. In contrast, at low filling of the energy-band, the disorder induced effect\nin the persistent current depends critically on the parity: due to a peculiar dependence on the\nflux, it yields a reduction of the current for odd Ne and an enhancement of it for even Ne . The\nobservability of the effects of weak correlated disorder on persistent current in the half-filled band\ncase is restricted to ring sizes in the nanoscale range, for which no measurements presently exist.\nPACS numbers: 72.15.Rn,73.23-b,73.23.Ra,73.63.Nm\n\n\u2217\n\nElectronic address: J.Heinrichs@ulg.ac.be\n\n2\n\n\fI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe study of persistent current in small metallic rings threaded by a magnetic flux has a\nlong history, starting with the basic papers of London[1] and Hund[2]. It has been boosted in\nrecent years with the appearance of the seminal paper of B\u00fcttiker, Imry and Landauer[3] for\none-dimensional rings. Important aspects related to the effects of disorder and of electronelectron interaction on the persistent current have been reviewed and compared with experimental observations[4, 5, 6] in well-known monographs[7, 8]and in review articles[9]. An\nimportant unsolved problem remains however to reconcile theoretical and experimental results for the persistent current, particularly in the case where the current averaged over many\nexperimental realizations of isolated disordered rings of a given metal has been measured[4].\nIn this case the theoretical results for the ensemble-averaged current are between one or\ntwo- orders of magnitude lower[7] than the experimental values[4] depending on whether\nelectron-electron interaction effects are included or not. However, the electron interaction\neffects are not easy to calculate and no definitive answer as to their precise role seems to\nexist since there are even models in which Coulomb interactions act to reduce the persistent\ncurrent rather than to enhancing it[10].\nIn the present paper we examine another effect which may substantially enhance the\npersistent current in a disordered ring subjected to a magnetic flux. This effect exists when\nthe disordered potential is not perfectly random as a result of short-range correlations.\nMore precisely, we consider an Anderson tight-binding model of a ring with an even number\nN = 2M of one level atomic sites (of spacing a = 1) whose energies \u03b5n fluctuate randomly\nabout a fixed free atom level chosen as zero of energy. As usual the N site energies are\nassumed to be identically distributed independent random variables. In order to account\nfor short-range correlations we extend the model as follows: we divide the ring up into\npairs of nearest-neighbour atomic sites (dimers), namely the pairs (1,2), (3,4) ... (2M-1,\n2M), where the sites within individual pairs are assumed to be gaussian correlated, whereas\nsites belonging to different pairs are uncorrelated. Including the usual autocorrelation, the\nGaussian correlation of site energies is then described by the averages\nh\u03b5n i = 0, h\u03b5m \u03b5n i = \u03b520 \u03b4min + \u03b12 (\u03b4m,2p\u22121 \u03b4n,2p + \u03b4m,2p \u03b4n,2p\u22121 )\n\n.\n\n(1)\n\nThe intersite coupling term in (1) describes short-range structural (dimer) correlations of\n3\n\n\fan otherwise uncorrelated (white-noise) random potential. In the following we refer to the\nGaussian model (1) as an Anderson random dimer model (ARDM) which was first discussed\nin the context of localization on a linear chain[11], in the case \u03b12 = \u03b520 . It differs from\nthe random dimer model (RDM) introduced earlier by Phillips and co-workers[12, 13] for\ndemonstrating the existence of delocalized states in a one-dimensional system with correlated\ndisorder. This model considers chains of N lattice sites composed of clusters of host atoms\na of site energy \u03b5a separated by clusters of defect atoms of energy \u03b5b occurring randomly but\nin pairs of nearest neighbours[12, 13]. Apart from its binary character this system differs\nfrom our ARDM in that clusters of a-atoms are not restricted to even numbers of atoms\nunlike the clusters composed of b-atoms. The RDM model of Phillips et al. leads to the\n\u221a\nexistence of N delocalized states in the linear chain lattice[12, 13]. In contrast, the ARDM\nmodel (for \u03b12 = \u03b520 ) on a linear chain lattice leads to localized states only, with a localization\nlength \u03be given by[11]\n1\n\u03b520 E 2\nE2\n\u2243\n=\n\u03be\n4(4 \u2212 E 2 )\n2\u03be0\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nfor weak disorder. Here E = 2 cos k is the energy band (in units of a constant nearestneighbour hopping parameter V ) of states of wavenumber k of the ordered lattice and \u03be0\nis the weak disorder Thouless localization length for uncorrelated Gaussian disorder in one\ndimension. The expression (2) is valid at energies E except for some special values within\nthe energy band (including E = 0) where the weak disorder treatment must be corrected for\nKappus-Wegner type anomalies[11, 14]. It follows from (2) that the localization length near\nthe band centre is strongly increased with respect to \u03be0 by the effect of disorder correlation.\nFor the tight-binding system on a ring threaded by a magnetic flux in the direction perpendicular to the ring the Schr\u00f6dinger equation reduces to the set of difference equations[15, 16]\ni 2\u03c0\nN\n\n\u2212e\n\n\u03c6\n\u03c60\n\n\u2212i 2\u03c0\nN\n\n\u03c6n+1 \u2212 e\n\ni 2\u03c0\nN\n\n\u2212e\n\ni 2\u03c0\nN\n\n\u2212e\n\n\u03c6\n\u03c60\n\n\u03c6\n\u03c60\n\n\u03c6\n\u03c60\n\n\u03c6n\u22121 + \u03b5n \u03c6n = E\u03c6n ,\n\n\u2212i 2\u03c0\nN\n\n\u03c62 \u2212 e\n\n\u2212i 2\u03c0\nN\n\n\u03c61 \u2212 e\n\n\u03c6\n\u03c60\n\n\u03c6\n\u03c60\n\nn = 2, 3, . . . , N \u2212 1 ,\n\n\u03c6N + \u03b51 \u03c61 = E\u03c61\n\n\u03c6N \u22121 + \u03b5N \u03c6N = E\u03c6N\n\n4\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n,\n\n(5)\n\n\fwhich embody the familiar flux-modified (twisted) boundary condition[3, 16] describing the\neffect of the magnetic flux.

In particular, Liu et al.[17] have shown that in the model of Dunlap\net al. the persistent current is enhanced by the disorder correlation to values approaching\nthe current in an ordered system if the Fermi level coincides with the energy of a delocalized\nstate. On the other hand, their numerical calculations indicate that the persistent current\nis strongly suppressed when no delocalized state is present near the Fermi level[17].\nThe study of the persistent current in the ARDM is of interest in view of its specific localization properties discussed above. In particular this study may allow us to clarify whether\nthe presence of a correlation induced delocalized state at the Fermi-level is indispensable\nfor obtaining large persistent currents as discussed by the authors of Refs [17] and [18] for\nthe RDM. These are our main motivations for the present work. The ensemble-averaged\nenergy eigenvalues for the ARDM model for weak disorder are discussed in Sect. II, using\nthe general perturbation expressions for the eigenvalues of Eqs. (3-5) derived in Ref. [16].\nThe detailed study of the ensemble-averaged persistent current successively for a system of\nNe \u226a N spinless electrons occupying a small portion of the energy-band of the ring described by (3-5), and for a system of Ne = N/2 electrons occupying the lower half of the\nenergy-band at zero temperature, is presented and discussed in Sect. III. Some final remarks\nare given in Sect. IV.\n5\n\n\fII.\n\nTHE PERTURBED ENERGY LEVELS OF THE RING\n\nExact general expressions for the one-electron energy levels of the ring threaded by a\nmagnetic flux and perturbed by a weak site energy disorder have been derived from (3-5)\nin Ref. [16], using an exact transfer matrix formalism and expanding the transfer matrix to\nsecond order in the disorder. In the absence of disorder the energy levels are given by the\nfamiliar tight-binding results[15, 16],\n2\u03c0\n\u03c6\nEk0 (\u03c6) = Ek0 = \u22122 cos\nk+\nN\n\u03c60\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere k = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, . . ., and the solution of the eigenvalue equation yields the following\nexact expressions for the first- and second order perturbations of the energy levels[16]\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nEk = Ek0 + Ek + Ek + . . .\n\n(1)\nEk\n\n(2)\nEk\n\n\u2261E\n\n(1)\n\nN\n1 X\n\u03b5n\n=\nN n=1\n\n(9)\n\n,\n\n(10)\n\nN X\nn\u22121\nX\n1\n(E (1) \u2212 \u03b5m )(E (1) \u2212 \u03b5n )\n=\nN sin qk sin Nqk n=2 m=1\n\n \u0307\n\u00d7 sin(n \u2212 m)qk sin(N\n\u2212 n + m)qk\n\nwhere\n2\u03c0\n\u03c6\nqk =\nk+\nN\n\u03c60\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(11)\n\n,\n\n(12)\n\nAs recalled in Ref. [16] the weak disorder expansion breaks down at flux values equal to\nhalf-integer multiples of \u03c60 including \u03c6 = 0 where (11) diverges[21]. Such divergencies are\nfamiliar in other perturbative studies of persistent current[22] and are due to the degeneracies\nof the unperturbed electron energies (8) at these flux values.\nAs in our earlier work[16] we are interested in the change of persistent current induced\nby the energy correction (11) averaged over the disorder. The derivation of the closed form\nof (11) averaged over the correlated disorder defined by (1) involves the following steps:\n1. for each one of the four disorder factors (E (1) )2 , \u2212\u03b5m E (1) , E (1) \u03b5n and \u03b5m \u03b5n (with E (1)\ndefined by (10)) which enter in the site summations in (11), we identify explicitly\n6\n\n\fthe individual nearest-neighbour pair terms with a non-vanishing correlation (1), in\naddition to the autocorrelation terms.\n2. after performing the disorder averaging, using (1), the various contributions reduce to\ncombinations of geometric series over sites, which are then summed in closed form. As\na guide to our calculations we list in the appendix the final explicit results obtained for\nthe four distinct disorder terms in (11).

[11].\nThe equations (9) and (13-15) are used in the following section for studying the\nensemble-averaged persistent currents.\n\n7\n\n\fIII.\n\nTHE PERSISTENT CURRENT IN THE RING\n\nWe first recall the results for the persistent current in the pure (non-disordered) tightbinding ring obtained from Eqs (6-8). The energy levels (8) occupied by the Ne spinless\nelectrons differ for odd and for even Ne , as well as for different domains of relative magnetic\nflux \u03c6/\u03c60 , as is well known[15]. The sets of occupied k-levels entering in the calculation\nof the total current in various cases may be inferred from the set of intersecting parabolas\nrepresenting the energy level spectrum as a function of flux in the free electron limit (see e.g.\nfig. 2 in Ref. [15]). They are defined by the values k = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, . . . , \u00b1(Ne \u2212 1)/2 for odd\nNe and \u22121/2 < \u03c6/\u03c60 < 1/2; and by k = 0, \u00b11, . . . , \u00b1(Ne /2 \u2212 1), \u2212Ne /2 for 0 < \u03c6/\u03c60 < 1/2\nand by k = 0, \u00b11, . . . , \u00b1(Ne /2\u22121), Ne /2 for \u22121/2 < \u03c6/\u03c60 < 0 for even Ne , respectively. The\nsummation of the contributions of the various levels (8) reduces to geometric progressions\nleading to the following mostly by well-known results for pure system currents I (0) [15, 17]:\nsin(2\u03c0\u03c6/N\u03c60 )\n2\u03c6\nI (0) = \u2212I0\n\u2243 \u2212I0 .\nsin \u03c0/N\n\u03c60\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\nodd Ne , \u2212 < \u03c6/\u03c60 <\n2\n2\n\n,\n(16)\n,\n\n!\nsin(\u03c0/N)(2\u03c6/\u03c6\n\u2212\n1)\n2\u03c6\n0\nI (0) = \u2212I0\n\u2243 \u2212I0\n\u22121\n,\nsin \u03c0/N\n\u03c60\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\neven Ne , 0 < \u03c6/\u03c60 <\n,\n2\n!\n2\u03c6\nsin(\u03c0/N)(2\u03c6/\u03c6\n+\n1)\n0\n\u2243 \u2212I0\n+1\n,\nI (0) = \u2212I0\nsin \u03c0/N\n\u03c60\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\neven Ne , \u2212 < \u03c6/\u03c60 < 0\n,\n2\nI0 =\n\nevF\n,\nN\n\nvF =\n\n4\u03c0\nsin kF ,\nh\n\nkF =\n\n\u03c0Ne\nN\n\n,\n\n(17a)\n\n(17b)\n\n(18)\n\nwhere the approximate limiting forms correspond to the limit N \u2192 \u221e and coincide in the\ncase of (16) and (17a) with earlier analytical results for free electrons[15]. vF and kF in\n(18) denote the tight-binding Fermi velocity and the Fermi momentum, respectively[16].\nThe limiting free electron expressions in (16) and (17a,17b) exhibit the familiar sawtoothed\ncurrents shown in figs. (3.a) and (3.b) of Ref. [15] (whose legends must be interchanged!).\n8\n\n\fWe now study the effect of the correlated disorder on the persistent current obtained\nfrom (6-10) and (13-15) for a system of Ne spinless electrons in the T = 0 ground state.\nOur general discussion is made systematic by considering successively the case of low filling,\nNe \u226a N, of the energy band and the case of higher filling exemplified by the half-filled band\ncase, Ne = N/2.\n\nA.\n\nLOW FILLING OF ENERGY BAND\n\nFor occupied levels with quantum numbers k \u226a N and magnetic flux restricted by (16)\nand (17a,17b) we use\n2\u03c0\nsin qk \u2243 qk =\nN\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c6\nk+\n\u03c60\n\n,\n\n(19)\n\nand by expanding (14-15) to lowest order for large N we obtain\n\u03b52\n2\u03c0\u03c6\n1\n= 0 cot\n\u2212\n4qk\n\u03c60\nNqk\n\n(2)\nhEk i\n\n!\n\n\u2212\n\n3\u03b12\n+ O[(qk )0 = 1] ,\n4Nqk2\n\n(20)\n\nwhere\n(2)\n\nhEk iuncorr\n\n\u03b52\n2\u03c0\u03c6\n1\n= 0 cot\n\u2212\n4qk\n\u03c60\nNqk\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(21)\n\nis the uncorrelated disorder perturbation at low band-filling obtained from (14).

By expanding\nthe denominators in question to leading order in qk and collecting terms we obtained the\n(2)\n\nexpression (20) for hEk i which we now use for calculating the persistent current induced by\nthe system of Ne electrons in the ground state when 1 \u226a Ne \u226a N.

For this\npurpose we use the series summation formula of Euler-Maclaurin[23],\n\nk+\nX\n\nk=k\u2212\n\nfk =\n\nZ\n\nK+\n\nK\u2212\n\n1\nf (k)d k \u2212 [f (K\u2212 ) + f (K+ )], K\u2212 = k\u2212 \u2212 1, K+ = k+ + 1 ,\n2\n\n(24)\n\nwhere we have retained only the leading boundary term of the general formula[23]. Here k\u2212\nand k+ denote, respectively, the smallest and the largest value of the quantum number k\nlabelling the occupied levels in the energy band of the ring. From the spectra of occupied\nenergy levels detailed above for the domains \u22121/2 < \u03c6/\u03c60 < 1/2 for odd and for even Ne\nwe have: k+ = \u2212k\u2212 = (Ne \u2212 1)/2 for odd Ne ; k+ = Ne /2 \u2212 1 and k\u2212 = \u2212Ne /2 for even Ne\nwith \u03c6 > 0; and k+ = Ne /2, k\u2212 = \u2212Ne /2 + 1 for even Ne and \u03c6 < 0.

This will be sufficient indeed for illustrating the\nqualitative differences between these cases.\nThe total persistent current (7) obtained from (23) involves three types of sums over\nP \u22121\nP \u22122\nP \u22123\noccupied levels, namely S1 =\nand S3 =\nWe recall\nk qk , S2 =\nk qk\nk qk .\n\nthe occupied levels in the various domains of flux, namely k = \u2212(Ne \u2212 1)/2, \u2212(Ne \u2212\n1)/2 + 1, . . . , 0, 1, . . . (Ne \u2212 1)/2 for odd Ne and \u22121/2 < \u03c6/\u03c60 < 1/2, k = \u2212Ne /2 +\n1, \u2212Ne /2 + 2, . . . , 0, . . .

The series S1\nwhich does not converge for k \u2192 \u221e requires special care.

This difficulty may be resolved by introducing a small\nk-cutoff for the domain of integration, say at k \u2261 kc = 1. This is justified since the lowest\ndiscrete levels contributing to the integral are the levels k = \u00b11, the effect of the level k = 0\nhaving been separated out in the first term on the right hand side of (28,29a,29b).

This shows\nthat for odd Ne the disorder reduces the persistent current with respect to the pure system\nresult (16) while enhancing it with respect to the corresponding pure system values (17a)\nand (17b) for even Ne .\nWe conclude that while the correlation effect may efficiently offset the effect of an uncorrelated potential on the persistent current both in the case of a single electron (see III A 1)\nand in that of a gas of a large number of electrons (see the case Ne = N/2 in III B below), it\ndoes not affect the effect of uncorrelated disorder on the persistent current in systems with\n1 << Ne << N at low order.\n\nB.\n\nHALF-FILLED BAND\n\nIn the case of a half-filled band the terms proportional to 1/N and to 1/N 2 in the energy\nlevel perturbations (14-15) may be ignored relative to the remaining terms of order one for\nenergy levels (8) near the Fermi level.

These expressions are invalid near \u03c6 = 0, which is a consequence\nof the breakdown of the perturbation expression (11) for flux values equal to half-integer\nmultiples of the flux quantum, as mentioned earlier.\nThe expressions (49) and (50a-50b) indicate that the disorder acts to renormalize the free\nparticle persistent currents (16) and (17a-17b by a common factor. In particular, it follows\nthat the correlation of the random potential leads to a systematic increase of the persistent\ncurrent proportional to \u03b12 . However, the important feature of (50a-50b) is that for \u03b12 less\nthan the critical value \u03b12 \u2261 \u03b1c2 = \u03b520 /2 the persistent current is reduced by the correlated\n\ndisorder while for \u03b12 > \u03b1c2 it is enhanced by it for any parity. In this respect, the results for\n\nthe persistent current at low band filling, 1 \u226a Ne \u226a N, discussed in III A above show an\ninteresting asymmetry. Indeed, in this case the effect of the correlated disorder is to reduce\nthe persistent current for odd Ne and to enhance it for even Ne . This is a consequence of\nthe fact that the flux dependence of the persistent current (38) induced by the disorder does\nnot follow the simple linear scalings of the pure system currents (16, 17a, 17b).\n\nC.\n\nDISCUSSION OF THE RESULTS\n\nIn this subsection we discuss the restrictions on ring lengths N and on relative flux values\nin (49) a nd (50a-50b) which are imposed by our non-degenerate perturbation study of the\neffect of the disorder on the energy levels of the ring in the presence of the applied flux.\nWe focus mainly on the case of the half-filled energy band where the effects of the disorder\non the persistent current may be observed in wide range of nanoscale ring parameters, as\nshown below.\nFirst, the perturbation expansion (9) in terms of the random site energies relative to the\nfixed intersite hopping parameter implies, by definition,\n16\n\n\f|\u03b50 | << 1, |\u03b1| << 1 ,\n\n(51)\n(0)\n\nwhich reflects the fact that the first order correction to the energy levels, Ek , of the pure\nsystem is q\nsmall. Next, the typical value of the first order shift of energy levels due to the\n(1)2\ndisorder, hEk i = (\u03b520 + \u03b12 )/N must be small compared to the spacing, |\u2206|, of the energy\n\nlevels of the pure system. From (8) we obtain\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\n\u2206 = Ek+1 (\u03c6) \u2212 Ek (\u03c6) =\n\n2\u03c0\n1\n\u03c6\n4\u03c0\nsin (k + + ) ,\nN\nN\n2 \u03c60\n\nwhich leads to the condition\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u221a q\n1\n\u03c6\n2\u03c0\n2\n\u2243 4\u03c0\n+\nN \u03b50 + \u03b12 << 4\u03c0 sin\nN 2 \u03c60\n\n,\n\n(52)\n\nat the Fermi level (where k = \u00b1Ne /2) in the half-filled band case. This condition which is\nimportant for close-spaced level systems (large N) expresses that disorder acts as a small\nperturbation on the (observable) excitation frequencies defined by \u2206. Since, for band fillings\nNe << N, the Eq. (52) restricts the discussion to rings of perimeters less than a few\nnanometers, we focus, in the remainder of this subsection, on the half-filled band case\nNe = N/2, where our analysis covers a much wider range of nanometric rings sizes. Also since\nhere we are mainly interested in analyzing the effect of small random potential correlations\n(\u03b12 \u2264 \u03b520 ) for rings of fixed length N we replace the condition (52) by the slightly weaker\nform:\n\u221a q\nN \u03b520 << 4\u03c0\n\n(52.a)\n\nat the fermi level of the half-filled band.\n\nFinally, an important restriction on the allowed flux values in (49) and (50a), (50b) arises\nfrom the second order perturbation expression for the effect of the disorder in the energy\nlevels (9-11). This requires the typical second order corrections of the energy levels to have\nmagnitudes of the order of \u03b520 . In the half-filled band case this condition is generally obeyed\n(2)\n\n\u2243 1. This\nby Eqs (39-40) for hEk i at the fermi level (where sin qk \u2243 1) by requiring cot 2\u03c0\u03c6\n\u03c60\nyields a lower limit\n\n\u03c6min = 0, 125\u03c60\n17\n\n,\n\n(53)\n\n\ffor the flux values at which the perturbation treatment of the disorder is valid.\nWe close this subsection with some typical numerical results for the renormalization factor\nin (49), 50a and (50b),\nA=1\u2212\n\n\u03b12\nN\u03b520 (1 \u2212 2\u03b7)\n,\n\u03b7\n=\n\u03b520\n8 sin2 2\u03c0\u03c6\n\u03c60\n\n,\n\n(54)\n\nof the pure system current by the effect of the disorder as a function of the correlation parameter \u03b7 = \u03b12 /\u03b520 . We choose |\u03b50 | = 0.1 and define a typical ring length N = (0, 4\u03c0)2/\u03b520 = 158\ncompatible with (52.a). Using these values, we obtain the results listed in table 1, for various values of \u03b7, for \u03c6 = \u03c6min and for an intermediate value, \u03c6 = 0.25\u03c60 , in the domain\n0 < \u03c6/\u03c60 < 1/2. Note that increasing the flux in the case \u03b7 < 0.5 enhances the magnitude\nof the disorder effect on the persistent current, while in the case \u03b7 > 0.5, increasing the flux\nreduces the effect of the correlated disorder.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nThe main conclusions of this work have been discussed in Sect.III along with our detailed\nresults for persistent currents in a metal ring in the presence of correlated disorder and the\ndiscussion of their domain of validity.\nWe conclude with some further general remarks, particularly in connection with the yet\nunexplained experimental observations of persistent currents.\nBy studying the persistent current in sufficiently large ensembles of rings it has been\npossible recently to obtain the correct sign, in addition to the magnitude, of the current[24,\n25, 26]. These measurements have shown the persistent current to be diamagnetic at low\nfields (i.e.\n\ndhIi\nd\u03c6\n\n< 0, \u03c6 \u2192 0). This observation constitutes a severe additional constraint for\n\nthe validity of theoretical explanations of persistent current in disordered rings. Indeed, as\nshown by (16), (17a) and (17b), a diamagnetic persistent current for any parity of the number\nof conduction electrons is generally obtained only for non-interacting free electrons. Now, our\nanalytical expressions (49), (50a) and (50b) for the effect of disorder on the persistent current\nin a half-filled band includes an additional flux-dependence which prevents the current from\nhaving a fixed negative sign independent of parity and ring size. We observe, however, that\nour theoretical results for persistent currents are inapplicable to measurements in rings of\nmesoscale perimeters of 2 to 8 \u03bcm used in the various experimental studies[4, 5, 6] and\n18\n\n\f[24, 25, 26]. Indeed, for values |\u03b520| \u2243 0.1, whith corresponding values 0 < |\u03b1| \u2264 0.1, the\ncondition (52) restricts the validity of our results to rings with a few hundred atomic sites\ni.e. to nanoscale perimeters less than 100 nm. We note incidently that typical ring sizes for\nwhich the effect of correlations of the random potential has been analyzed numerically in\nRefs.[17, 18, 19] lie also in this range. In conclusion, it would be interesting if experimental\nstudies could be performed for ensembles of rings of nanoscale sizes in order to test the\ndetailed behavior of persistent currents shown theoretically in this paper and numerically,\nfor a different model, in Refs.[17, 18, 19].\nOur results for the persistent current for a half-filled band in our ARDM model indicate\na strong enhancement of the current due to the correlation of the random potential for\n\u03b12 \u2265 \u03b520 /2. The detailed mechanism for the enhancement of persistent current by correlation\nfor the ARDM model[11] on a ring threaded by a magnetic flux is quite different from the\nmechanism identified in recent numerical calculations for the RDM model of Dunlap, Wu and\nPhillips[12] in Refs. [17, 19]. We recall that the linear chain RDM model differs essentially\n\u221a\nfrom the ARDM by the existence of a fraction N of extended states[12, 13]. For the\nRDM model values of persistent current of the order of the values for free electrons are\nfound only when the Fermi level coincides with the energy of an extended state, both for\neven Ne [17, 19] and for odd Ne (for an asymmetric dimer model)[18]. In contrast, for Ne\nvalues corresponding to relatively large band fillings but for which the Fermi level does not\ncoincide with an extended state, the persistent current is found to be strongly diminished\nby the correlated disorder[17, 18]. Thus for the RDM a strong compensation of the current\nreduction due to the uncorrelated disorder by the effect of correlation does not seem to\nexist[17, 18], in contrast to what is shown for the half-filled band in (49) and (50a,50b) for\nthe ARDM. We note, however, that the numerical results of Refs[17, 18] pertain to a case\nof maximal disorder (equal number of a- and b-atoms in the RDM), while our analytical\nresults are restricted to weak disorder in the ARDM.\nAs shown in Sect. III C, our results for the persistent current are valid only for flux values\nlarger than a value of the order of \u03c60 /8. Thus the sign of the persistent current obtained form\nEqs. (49, 50a, 50b) could be compared with experimental results at flux values \u03c6 > \u03c60 /8\nonly, rather than for \u03c6 \u2192 0 as in recent experimental studies[24, 25, 26].\n\n19\n\n\fV.\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nDefining\nAn m =\n\nsin(n \u2212 m)qk sin(N \u2212 n + m)qk\nsin qk sin N qk\n\n,\n\n(A.1)\n\n(2)\n\nthe various contributions to the disorder average, hEk i, of (11) are given by\nN n\u22121\n1 XX\n(\u03b52 + \u03b12 )\n(N cot Nqk \u2212 cot qk ) ,\nh(E (1) )2 iAnm = \u2212 0\nN n=2 m=1\n4N sin qk\nN n\u22121\n1 XX\n\u03b12 sin(N \u2212 1)qk\nh\u03b5m \u03b5n iAnm =\nN n=2 m=1\n2\nsin qk\n\n,\n\n(A.2)\n\n(A.3)\n\n(\nN n\u22121\n2\n2\n2\n(\u03b5\n\u2212\n\u03b1\n)\n\u03b1\n1 XX\nh\u03b5m E (1) iAnm = 0\nN 2 cos Nqk\n(N cot Nqk \u2212cot qk )+ 2\n\u2212\nN n=2 m=1\n4N sin qk\n4N sin qk sin Nqk\n\"\n!\n#\ne\u2212i(N +2)qk e4iqk (1 \u2212 e2iN qk ) N\n\u22122\n+ c.c.\n\u2212\n1 \u2212 e\u22124iqk\n1 \u2212 e4iqk\n2\n!\n#)\n\"\nN\n1 \u2212 e2iN qk\ne\u2212iN qk\n+ c.c.\n, (A.4)\n\u2212\n\u22122\n1 \u2212 e\u22124iqk 1 \u2212 e4iqk\n2\n(\nN n\u22121\n1 X X (1)\n(\u03b520 \u2212 \u03b12 )\n\u03b12\n\u2212\nhE \u03b5n iAnm =\n(N cot Nqk \u2212cot qk )+ 2\n2N(N\u22121) cos Nqk\nN n=2 m=1\n4N sin qk\n4N sin qk sin Nqk\n\"\ne\u2212i(N \u22122)qk 1 \u2212 e2i(N \u22121)qk\n1 + e\u22122iqk \u2212 e2iN qk (e4iqk + e\u22122iqk )\n\u2212\n+\n1 \u2212 e\u22122iqk\n1 \u2212 e2iqk\n1 \u2212 e4iqk\n!\n#)\n\u0013\n\u0012\nN\nN\n+ 1 e\u22122iqk \u2212 e\u22126iqk + c.c.\n.
