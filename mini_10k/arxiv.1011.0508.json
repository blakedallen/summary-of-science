Approaches to account for the\nlate time cosmic acceleration fall into two representative categories: One is to introduce\n\"dark energy\" in the right-hand side of the Einstein equation in the framework of general\nrelativity (for a review on dark energy, see [8]). The other is to modify the left-hand side of\nthe Einstein equation, called as a modified gravitational theory, e.g., f (R) gravity [9\u201311].\nAs another possible way to examine gravity beyond general relativity, one could use\nthe Weitzenb\u00f6ck connection, which has no curvature but torsion, rather than the curvature\ndefined by the Levi-Civita connection. Such an approach is referred to \"teleparallelism\" (see,\ne.g., [12\u201315]), which was also taken by Einstein [16]. To explain the late time acceleration of\nthe universe, the teleparallel Lagrangian density described by the torsion scalar T has been\nextended to a function of T [17, 18]1 . This idea is equivalent to the concept of f (R) gravity,\nin which the Ricci scalar R in the Einstein-Hilbert action is promoted to a function of R.\nRecently, f (T ) gravity has been extensively studied in the literature [20\u201325].\nIn this paper, we explicitly examine the cosmological evolution in the exponential f (T )\ntheory [18, 23] in more detail with the analysis method in Ref. [26]. In particular, we study\nthe equation of state (wDE ) and energy density (\u03c1DE ) for dark energy. The recent cosmological observational data [27] seems to imply a dynamical dark energy of equation of state with\nthe crossing of the phantom divide line wDE = \u22121 from the non-phantom phase to phantom\nphase as the redshift z decreases in the near past. However, we illustrate that the universe\nwith the exponential f (T ) theory always stays in the non-phantom (quintessence) phase or\nthe phantom one, and hence the crossing of the phantom divide cannot be realized [23]. It\nis interesting to mention that such an exponential type as f (R) gravity models has been\ninvestigated in Refs. [28\u201330]. We also present a logarithmic f (T ) theory and show that it\nhas a similar feature as the exponential one. Our motivation in this paper is to build up\na realistic f (T ) theory in which the same behavior of the crossing of the phantom divide\n1\n\nModels based on modified teleparallel gravity for inflation have been investigated in Ref. [19].\n\n2\n\n\fas indicated by the data can be achieved. For this purpose, we will construct a combined\nf (T ) theory with both logarithmic and exponential terms. Furthermore, we examine the\nobservational constraints on the combined f (T ) theory by using the recent observational\ndata of SNe Ia, BAO and CMB. We note that two f (T ) models with the crossing of the\nphantom divide have also been proposed in Ref. [22].\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce f (T ) theory and derive the\ngravitational field equations. In Sec. III, we investigate the cosmological evolutions in the\nexponential and logarithmic f (T ) theories. In Sec. IV, we propose a model which combines\nthe two theories in Sec. III to achieve the crossing of the phantom divide. In Sec. V, we\nexplore the observational constraints on the combined model in Sec. IV. Finally, conclusions\nare given in Sec. VI.\n\nII.\n\nTHE COSMOLOGICAL FORMULAE IN f (T ) GRAVITY\n\nIn the teleparallelism, orthonormal tetrad components eA (x\u03bc ) are used, where an index\nA runs over 0, 1, 2, 3 for the tangent space at each point x\u03bc of the manifold. Their relation\nto the metric g \u03bc\u03bd is given by\nB\ng\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b7AB eA\n\u03bc e\u03bd ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere \u03bc and \u03bd are coordinate indices on the manifold and also run over 0, 1, 2, 3, and e\u03bcA\nforms the tangent vector of the manifold.\nThe torsion T \u03c1\u03bc\u03bd and contorsion K \u03bc\u03bd \u03c1 tensors are defined by\n\u0001\nA\nT \u03c1\u03bc\u03bd \u2261 e\u03c1A \u2202\u03bc eA\n\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd e\u03bc ,\n\u0001\n1\nK \u03bc\u03bd \u03c1 \u2261 \u2212 T \u03bc\u03bd \u03c1 \u2212 T \u03bd\u03bc \u03c1 \u2212 T\u03c1 \u03bc\u03bd .\n2\n\n(2.2)\n(2.3)\n\nInstead of the Ricci scalar R for the Lagrangian density in general relativity, the teleparallel\nLagrangian density is described by the torsion scalar T , defined as\nT \u2261 S\u03c1 \u03bc\u03bd T \u03c1\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere\n\u0001\n1\nK \u03bc\u03bd \u03c1 + \u03b4\u03c1\u03bc T \u03b1\u03bd \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4\u03c1\u03bd T \u03b1\u03bc\u03b1 .\n2\nConsequently, the modified teleparallel action for f (T ) theory is given by [18]\nZ\n1\nd4 x|e| (T + f (T )) ,\nI=\n16\u03c0G\nS\u03c1 \u03bc\u03bd \u2261\n\n3\n\n(2.5)\n\n(2.6)\n\n\f\u0001 \u221a\nwhere |e| = det eA\n\u2212g.\n\u03bc =\n\nWe assume the flat Friedmann-Lema\u0131\u0302tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) space-time with the\n\nmetric,\nds2 = dt2 \u2212 a2 (t)dx2 ,\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere a(t) is the scale factor. In this space-time, g\u03bc\u03bd = diag(1, \u2212a2 , \u2212a2 , \u2212a2 ) and therefore\n2\nthe tetrad components eA\n\u03bc = (1, a, a, a) yield the exact value of torsion scalar T = \u22126H ,\n\nwhere H = \u0227/a is the Hubble parameter. We use units of kB = c = ~ = 1 and the\n\u22122\ngravitational constant G = MPl\nwith the Planck mass of MPl = 1.2 \u00d7 1019 GeV.\n\nIt follows from the variation principle that in the flat FLRW background, the modified\nFriedmann equations are given by [17, 18]\nf\n8\u03c0G\n\u03c1M \u2212 \u2212 2H 2 fT ,\n3\n6\n\u0001\n16\u03c0GPM + 6H 2 + f + 12H 2fT\n\u2032\nH2 =\n,\n24H 2fT T \u2212 2 \u2212 2fT\nH2 =\n\n(2.8)\n(2.9)\n\nwhere a prime denotes a derivative with respect to ln a, fT \u2261 df (T )/dT , fT T \u2261 d2 f (T )/dT 2,\nand \u03c1M and PM are the energy density and pressure of all perfect fluids of generic matter,\nrespectively.\nBy comparing the above modified Friedmann equations (2.8) and (2.9) with the ordinary\nones in general relativity:\n8\u03c0G\n(\u03c1M + \u03c1DE ) ,\nH2 =\n3\n\u0001\u2032\nH 2 = \u22128\u03c0G (\u03c1M + PM + \u03c1DE + PDE ) ,\n\n(2.10)\n(2.11)\n\nthe energy density and pressure of the effective dark energy can be described by\n1\n(\u2212f + 2T fT ) ,\n16\u03c0G\n1 f \u2212 T fT + 2T 2 fT T\n.\n=\n16\u03c0G 1 + fT + 2T fT T\n\n\u03c1DE =\n\n(2.12)\n\nPDE\n\n(2.13)\n\nThe equation of state for dark energy is defined as [18]\nwDE \u2261\n\nPDE\nT \u2032 fT + 2T fT T\nf /T \u2212 fT + 2T fT T\n= \u22121 +\n=\u2212\n.\n\u03c1DE\n3T f /T \u2212 2fT\n(1 + fT + 2T fT T ) (f /T \u2212 2fT )\n\n(2.14)\n\nSince we are interested in the late time universe, we consider only non-relativistic matter\n(cold dark matter and baryon) with \u03c1M = \u03c1m and PM = Pm = 0, where \u03c1m and Pm are\nthe energy density and pressure of non-relativistic matter, respectively. Consequently, from\n4\n\n\fEqs. (2.8) and (2.9) it can be shown that the effective dark energy satisfies the continuity\nequation\nd\u03c1DE\n\u2261 \u03c1\u2032DE = \u22123 (1 + wDE ) \u03c1DE ,\ndN\n\n(2.15)\n\nwhere N \u2261 ln a.\nIII.\n\nCOSMOLOGICAL EVOLUTION IN THE EXPONENTIAL AND LOGA-\n\nRITHMIC f (T ) THEORIES\n\nTo analyze the cosmological evolution of the equation of state for dark energy wDE in\nf (T ) theory, we define a dimensionless variable [26]:\nyH \u2261\n\n\u03c1DE\nH2\n\u2212 a\u22123 = (0) ,\n2\nm\u0304\n\u03c1m\n\nwhere\n\n(3.1)\n\n(0)\n\n8\u03c0G\u03c1m\n,\nm\u0304 \u2261\n3\n2\n\n(3.2)\n\n(0)\n\nand \u03c1m = \u03c1m (z = 0) is the current density parameter of non-relativistic matter with the\nredshift z \u2261 1/a \u2212 1. Using Eq. (2.15), we obtain the evolution equation of the universe as\nfollows:\n\u2032\nyH\n= \u22123 (1 + wDE ) yH .\n\n(3.3)\n\nNote that wDE is a function of T , while T is a function of H 2 . Moreover, it follows from\nEq. (3.1) that H 2 = m\u03042 (yH + a\u22123 ).\n\nA.\n\nExponential f (T ) theory\n\nWe consider the exponential f (T ) theory in Ref.

(2.12) with T = T0 and\n(0)\n\n\u03c1DE = \u03c1DE (z = 0). We remark that the theory in Eq. (3.4) contains only one parameter\n(0)\n\np if the value of \u03a9m is given. The values of other dimensionless quantities at z = 0 can\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(0)\n(0)\n(0)\nbe calculated by using p and \u03a9m , e.g., m\u03042 /T0 = 8\u03c0G\u03c1m /3 / (\u22126H02 ) = \u2212\u03a9m /6 and\n(0)\n\nyH (z = 0) = H02 /m\u03042 \u2212 1 = 1/\u03a9m \u2212 1.\n\nIn Fig. 1, we depict the equation of state for dark energy wDE in Eq. (2.14) as a function\n(0)\n\nof the redshift z for |p| = 0.1, 0.01, 0.001. We have used \u03a9m = 0.26 [4] in all numerical\ncalculations. From Fig. 1, we see that wDE does not cross the phantom divide line wDE =\n\u22121 in the exponential f (T ) theory [18, 23]. In particular, for p < 0 the universe always\nstays in the non-phantom (quintessence) phase (wDE > \u22121), whereas for p > 0 it in the\nphantom phase (wDE < \u22121). The present values of wDE are wDE (z = 0) = \u22121.03, \u22121.003,\n\u22121.0003, \u22120.954, \u22120.996 and \u22120.999 for p = 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, p = \u22120.1, \u22120.01 and \u22120.001,\nrespectively. The larger |p| is, the larger the deviation of the exponential f (T ) theory from\nthe \u039bCDM model is. We note that in solving Eq. (3.3) numerically, we have taken the initial\nconditions at z = 0 as yH (z = 0) = 2.8.\n\n6\n\n\fFIG. 2: wDE as a function of |T /T0 |, where the thin solid line shows wDE = \u22121 (cosmological\nconstant). Legend is the same as Fig. 1.\n\nFIG. 3: |T /T0 | as a function of the redshift z for |p| = 0.1.\n\nWe display wDE as a function of |T /T0 | in Fig. 2, where the left and right panels are for\np > 0 and p < 0, respectively. In Fig. 3, we show the cosmological evolution of |T /T0 | as a\nfunction of the redshift z for |p| = 0.1. The qualitative behaviors of |T /T0 | for |p| = 0.01\nand 0.001 are similar to those for |p| = 0.1. In addition, the cosmological evolution of\n(0)\n\n\u03c1\u22c6DE \u2261 \u03c1DE /\u03c1DE as a function of the redshift z is shown in Fig. 4.\n\nFrom Fig. 2, we find that the crossing of the phantom divide occurs around |T /T0 | \u2248\n0.7 < 1. This means that the crossing cannot be realized in the past and far future, unlike\nthose in f (R) models [29]. Explicitly, by denoting |T /T0 |cross being the crossing point, we\nhave |T /T0 |cross \u2243 0.772, 0.744, 0.740, 0.689, 0.736, and 0.740 for p = 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, \u22120.1,\n7\n\n\f(0)\n\nFIG. 4: \u03c1\u22c6DE \u2261 \u03c1DE /\u03c1DE as a function of the redshift z, where the thin solid line shows wDE = \u22121\n(cosmological constant). Legend is the same as Fig. 1.\n\n\u22120.01, and \u22120.001, respectively. Clearly, the universe reaches the line wDE = \u22121 without a\ncrossing even in the very far future (z \u2243 \u22121).\nIn the high z regime, the universe is at the matter-dominated stage and therefore, |T | =\n\n6H 2 = 16\u03c0G (\u03c1m + \u03c1DE ) decreases with time. Around the present time (z = 0), \u03c1m is smaller\n\nthan \u03c1DE and dark energy becomes dominant over matter. Fig. 3 illustrates that |T /T0 |\ndecreases monotonously with z. At the infinite future, |T /T0 |cross is reached. However, the\nthe universe is in either the phantom phase (p > 0) or non-phantom phase (p < 0) without\nthe crossing. Since by that time the contribution from non-relativistic matter and radiation\nis supposed to be negligible, such an evolution pattern of |T /T0 | is driven by the f (T ) term.\nIn the future (z < 0), \u03c1DE arrives at the crossing point and finally becomes constant as\nshown in Fig. 4.\nThe right-hand side of the first equality in Eq. (2.14) implies that when wDE crosses the\nphantom divide line of wDE = \u22121, the term T \u2032 (fT + 2T fT T ) / [3T (f /T \u2212 2fT )] has to flip\n\nthe sign. Since the sign of T is fixed to be negative due to T = \u22126H 2 , the sufficient and\nnecessary conditions for the crossing of the phantom divide is that the sign of the combination\n\nT \u2032 (fT + 2T fT T ) / (f /T \u2212 2fT ) changes in the cosmological evolution. Note that the sign of\n\u1e22 is opposite to T \u2032 since T \u2032 = \u221212HH \u2032 = \u221212\u1e22. When the energy density of dark energy\n\nbecomes perfectly dominant over those of non-relativistic matter and radiation, one has\nwDE \u2248 weff \u2261 \u22121 \u2212 2\u1e22/ (3H 2) = Ptot /\u03c1tot , where weff is the effective equation of state for\nthe universe [9], and \u03c1tot \u2261 \u03c1DE +\u03c1m +\u03c1r and Ptot \u2261 PDE +Pr are the total energy density and\n8\n\n\fpressure of the universe, with \u03c1r and Pr being the energy density and pressure of radiation,\nrespectively. For \u1e22 < 0 (> 0), weff > \u22121 (< \u22121), representing the non-phantom (phantom)\nphase, while weff = \u22121 for \u1e22 = 0, corresponding to the cosmological constant. Clearly,\nthe physical reason why the crossing of the phantom divide appears is that the sign of \u1e22\nchanges from negative (the non-phantom phase) to positive (the phantom phase) due to the\ndominance of dark energy over non-relativistic matter and radiation.\nWe now investigate why the crossing of the phantom divide cannot occur in the exponential f (T ) theory in Eq. (3.4) for p \u2264 1. From Eq. (3.4), we obtain\n\u0012\n\u0013\npT0 pT0 /T\npT0 /T\nfT = \u03b1 1 \u2212 e\n+\n,\ne\nT\n\u0012\n\u00132\npT0\n1 pT0 /T\nfT T = \u2212\u03b1\ne\n.\nT\nT\n\n(3.6)\n(3.7)\n\nTo illustrate our results, we only concentrate on the limits of 0 < p \u226a 1 and X \u2261 pT0 /T \u226a 1\nIn this case, T0 /T . 1, which corresponds to the region from the far past to the near future.\nConsequently, Eqs. (3.4), (3.6) and (3.7) are approximately expressed as\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03b1X 2\nX2\nf\n, fT \u2248\n\u2248 \u2212\u03b1 X +\n, T fT T \u2248 \u2212\u03b1X 2 .\nT\n2\n2\n\n(3.8)\n\nBy using these equations, we find\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nf\n3X\n,\n\u2212 2fT \u2248 \u2212\u03b1X 1 +\nT\n2\n3\u03b1X 2\nfT + 2T fT T \u2248 \u2212\n.\n2\n\n(3.9)\n(3.10)\n\nFrom Eqs. (3.9) and (3.10), we see that the signs of both f /T \u2212 2fT and fT + 2T fT T do not\nchange. Note that the sign of T \u2032 is also unchanged because |T /T0 | decreases monotonously\n\nwith z until |T /T0 |min as shown in Fig. 3. As a result, the crossing of the phantom divide\ncannot be realized in the exponential f (T ) theory.\n(0)\n\nIn Fig. 5, we illustrate the fractional densities of dark energy (\u03a9DE \u2261 \u03c1DE /\u03c1crit ), non(0)\n\n(0)\n\nrelativistic matter (\u03a9m \u2261 \u03c1m /\u03c1crit ) and radiation (\u03a9r \u2261 \u03c1r /\u03c1crit ) as functions of the redshift\nz for |p| = 0.1. The cosmological evolutions of \u03a9DE , \u03a9m and \u03a9r for |p| = 0.01 and 0.001 are\nsimilar to those for |p| = 0.1. In order to analyze not only non-relativistic matter and dark\nenergy but also radiation, we have included the contribution from radiation in Eq. (3.1) and\nused the following variable [26]:\nyH =\n\nH2\n\u2212 a\u22123 \u2212 \u03c7a\u22124 ,\nm\u03042\n9\n\n(3.11)\n\n\fFIG. 5: \u03a9DE (dashed line), \u03a9m (solid line) and \u03a9r (dash-dotted line) as functions of the redshift z\nfor |p| = 0.1.

As z decreases, the universe enters the matter-dominated stage (\u03a9m > \u03a9DE ,\n\u03a9m \u226b \u03a9r ). After that, eventually dark energy becomes dominant over matter for z < zDE ,\nwhere zDE is the crossover point in which \u03a9DE = \u03a9m . Explicitly, we have zDE = 0.40\nand 0.44 for p = 0.1 and \u22120.1, respectively. At the present time (z = 0), as an initial\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\ncondition we have used (\u03a9DE , \u03a9m , \u03a9r ) = (0.74, 0.26, 8.1 \u00d7 10\u22125 ). Note that zDE = 0.42 in\n\nthe \u039bCDM model. As a result, the current accelerated expansion of the universe following\nthe radiation-dominated and matter-dominated stages can be achieved in the exponential\nf (T ) theory.\n\nB.\n\nLogarithmic f (T ) theory\n\nIn this subsection, we examine a logarithmic f (T ) theory, given by\n\u0013\u22121/2 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\nqT0\nqT0\n,\nln\nf (T ) = \u03b2T0\nT\nT\nwith\n\n(3.13)\n\n(0)\n\n1 \u2212 \u03a9m\n\u03b2\u2261\n,\n2q \u22121/2\n10\n\n(3.14)\n\n\f(0)\n\nFIG. 6: wDE as functions of z (left panel) and |T /T0 | (right panel) for q = 1 and \u03a9m = 0.26 in\nthe logarithmic f (T ) theory, where the thin solid line shows wDE = \u22121 (cosmological constant).\n\nwhere q is a positive constant. We note that the theory in Eq. (3.13) contains only one\n(0)\n\nparameter q if the value of \u03a9m is obtained in the same way as the exponential f (T ) theory.\nIn Fig. 6, we draw wDE as functions of z (left panel) and |T /T0 | (right panel) for q = 1\n(0)\n\nand \u03a9m = 0.26 in the logarithmic f (T ) theory in Eq. (3.13). From Fig. 6, we observe that\nwDE does not cross the phantom divide line wDE = \u22121, similar to the exponential theory. In\nthis logarithmic theory, the universe is always in the non-phantom phase (wDE > \u22121) and\n|T /T0 | decreases monotonously with z. The present value of wDE is wDE (z = 0) = \u22120.79 for\nq = 1. The right figure in Fig. 6 indicates that the crossing of the phantom divide occurs\nat |T /T0 |cross = 0.547600 and the minimum of |T /T0 | is |T /T0 |min = 0.547600. Thus, the\nuniverse does not cross the line of wDE = \u22121 even in the very far future (z \u2243 \u22121).\nWe remark that wDE is qualitatively independent of the value of q. This is because in\nthe logarithmic f (T ) theory, wDE and \u03c1DE can be expressed as\nwDE = \u2212\nand\n\u03c1DE\n\n1\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(0)\n2 \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03a9m (T /T0 )\u22121/2\n\n\u0001\nT\n=\u2212\n1 \u2212 \u03a9(0)\nm\n16\u03c0G\n\n\u0012\n\nT\nT0\n\n\u0013\u22121/2\n\n(3.15)\n\n,\n\n(3.16)\n\nrespectively. Similar to the exponential f (T ) theory, it is easy to show that the crossing of\nthe phantom divide cannot occur in the logarithmic f (T ) theory.\n\n11\n\n\fIV.\n\nREALIZING THE CROSSING OF THE PHANTOM DIVIDE IN f (T ) THE-\n\nORY\n\nAs shown in the previous section, the universe always stays in the phantom and nonphantom phases in the exponential (p > 0) and logarithmic f (T ) theories, respectively.\nIn this section, we investigate the cosmological evolution in a combined f (T ) theory with\nboth logarithmic and exponential terms and check if the crossing of the phantom divide can\nhappen in this combined theory. The explicit form of the theory is given by\n\" \u0012\n#\n\u0013\u22121/2 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0001\nuT0\nuT0\nf (T ) = \u03b3 T0\n\u2212 T 1 \u2212 euT0 /T\nln\nT\nT\nwith\n\n(4.1)\n\n(0)\n\n\u03b3\u2261\n\n1 \u2212 \u03a9m\n,\n\u22121/2\n2u\n+ [1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 2u) eu ]\n\n(4.2)\n\nwhere u is a constant. Here, we have taken p = q = u > 0 to simplify our discussions when\nwe combine Eqs. (3.4) and (3.13). We note that the model in Eq. (4.1) contains only one\n(0)\n\nparameter u if one has the value of \u03a9m like the exponential and logarithmic models.\nIn Fig. 7, we plot the equation of state for dark energy wDE as a function of the redshift\n(0)\n\nz for u = 1, 0.8 and 0.5 and \u03a9m = 0.26 in the combined f (T ) theory in Eq. (4.1). As seen\nfrom Fig. 7, it is clear that wDE can cross wDE = \u22121 at z = zcross . The universe evolves from\nthe non-phantom phase (wDE > \u22121) to the phantom one (wDE < \u22121) and finally approaches\nwDE = \u22121. The present values of wDE are wDE (z = 0) = \u22121.1, \u22121.1 and \u22120.94 for u = 1,\n0.8 and 0.5, respectively. The crossing values of zcross are 0.70 and 0.36 for u = 1 and 0.8,\nrespectively. It is interesting to note that such a crossing behavior is consistent with the\nrecent cosmological observational data [27], but it is opposite to those in the viable f (R)\ntheories [29]. We note that for u \u2264 0.5, the universe asymptotically approaches wDE = \u22121\nwithout crossing it even in the very far future. The cosmological evolution of wDE as a\nfunction of |T /T0 | is shown in Fig. 8, while that of |T /T0 | as a function of z for u = 1 is\n(0)\n\ndepicted in Fig. 9. In addition, \u03c1\u22c6DE \u2261 \u03c1DE /\u03c1DE as a function of z is given in Fig. 10.\n\n12\n\n\fFIG. 7: wDE as a function of the redshift z for u = 1 (solid line), 0.8 (dashed line), 0.5 (dash-dotted\n(0)\n\nline) and \u03a9m = 0.26 in the combined f (T ) theory with both logarithmic and exponential terms\nin Eq.

Legend is the same as Fig. 7.\n\nWe now demonstrate that the crossing of the phantom divide can occur in the combined\nf (T ) theory in Eq. (4.1). In this theory, both signs of T and T \u2032 are unchanged like the\n\n13\n\n\fFIG. 9: |T /T0 | as a function of the redshift z for u = 1.

From\nEq. (4.4), we see that the sign of f /T \u2212 2fT is fixed, while that of fT + 2T fT T can change\n\nwhen uT0 /T becomes larger or smaller than the value of uT0 /T = [2/ (3u)]2/3 . Hence, the\nsufficient and necessary conditions for the crossing of the phantom divide in the combined\nf (T ) theory can be satisfied.\n\n(0)\n\nIn Fig. 11, we demonstrate the fractional densities of dark energy (\u03a9DE \u2261 \u03c1DE /\u03c1crit ),\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\nnon-relativistic matter (\u03a9m \u2261 \u03c1m /\u03c1crit ) and radiation (\u03a9r \u2261 \u03c1r /\u03c1crit ) as functions of z for\nu = 1. The evolutions of |T /T0 |, \u03a9DE , \u03a9m and \u03a9r for u = 0.8 and u = 0.5 are similar to those\nfor u = 1. In the high z regime (z & 3225), the universe is at the radiation-dominated stage\n(\u03a9r \u226b \u03a9DE , \u03a9r > \u03a9m ). As z decreases, the matter-dominated stage (\u03a9m > \u03a9DE , \u03a9m \u226b \u03a9r )\nfollows, and eventually dark energy becomes dominant over matter for z < zDE . Explicitly,\nwe have zDE = 0.36, 0.40 and 0.49 for u = 1, 0.8 and 0.5, respectively. As a consequence,\n15\n\n\fafter the radiation and matter-dominated stages, the current accelerated expansion of the\nuniverse can be realized in the combined f (T ) theory in Eq. (4.1), similar to that in the\nexponential f (T ) theory.\nFinally, we remark that since the gravitational field equation in f (R) gravity has the\nfourth-order nature, it is possible to reproduce an arbitrary background expansion history,\nprovided that we do not consider the stability issue [31, 32]). On the other hand, in the\nmodified Gauss-Bonnet or f (G) gravities, the \u039bCDM background expansion history cannot\nbe achieved all the way down to the far future [33]. In f (T ) gravity, there exists a similar\nrestriction. Physically, in such modified gravity theories the modified background expansion\nrate H is in general a function of H itself and \u1e22, which means that arbitrary expansion\nhistories are not guaranteed to be realizable.\n\nV.\n\nOBSERVATIONAL CONSTRAINTS ON THE COMBINED f (T ) THEORY\n\nIn Sec. IV, we have constructed the combined f (T ) theory with both logarithmic and\nexponential terms to realize the crossing of the phantom divide. Since it is difficult to\nobtain the information on the form of f (T ) from more fundamental theories, it is important\nto examine whether this theory is compatible with the recent observational data. In this\nsection we demonstrate how well the combined f (T ) theory can fit the observational data.\nWe examine the constraints on the model parameter u and the current fractional non(0)\n\nrelativistic matter density \u03a9m by taking the \u03c72 method for the recent observational data.\nWe use type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) data from the Supernova Cosmology Project (SCP)\nUnion2 compilation [34], the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data from the Two-Degree\nField Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release\n7 (SDSS DR7) [35], and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation data from\nSeven-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) observations [4]. The detailed\nanalysis method [30] for the observational data of SNe Ia, BAO and CMB is summarized in\nAppendix A.\n\nWe plot the contours of the 68.27% (1\u03c3), 95.45% (2\u03c3) and 99.73% (3\u03c3) confidence lev(0)\n\nels (CL) in the (\u03a9m , u) plane from the SNe Ia, BAO and CMB data for the combined\n16\n\n\fu\n\n(0)\n\nFIG. 12: Contours of 68.27% (1\u03c3), 95.45% (2\u03c3) and 99.73% (3\u03c3) confidence levels in the (\u03a9m , u)\nplane from SNe Ia, BAO and CMB data for the combined f (T ) theory, where the plus sign depicts\nthe best-fit point.\n(0)\n\nTABLE I: The best-fit values of u, \u03a9m , h and \u03c72min for the combined f (T ) and \u039bCDM models.\nModel\n\nu\n\n(0)\n\n\u03a9m\n\nh\n\n\u03c72min\n\nf (T ) 0.829 0.282 0.691 544.56\n\u039bCDM\n\n0.275 0.707 545.23\n\n(0)\n\nf (T ) theory in Fig. 12. In this figure, we have fitted three parameters of u, \u03a9m and\nh \u2261 H0 /100/[km sec\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ] [36]. The model parameter u is constrained to 0.6 < u < 1.13\n(0)\n\n(95.45% CL) whereas 0.255 < \u03a9m < 0.312 (95.45% CL), which is consistent with the\ncurrent observations. The best-fit value, i.e., the minimum \u03c72 , in the parameter space is\n\u03c72min = 544.56 with u = 0.829, \u03a90m = 0.282 and h = 0.691. In Table I, we present the\n(0)\n\nbest-fit values of u, \u03a9m and h, and \u03c72min for the combined f (T ) theory along with those for\nthe \u039bCDM model. From Table I, we see that \u03c72min of the combined f (T ) theory is slightly\nsmaller than that of the \u039bCDM model. This implies that the combined f (T ) theory can fit\nthe observational data well.\nWe remark that for around the best-fit value of the model parameter u \u2248 0.8, wDE can\ncross the phantom divide line of wDE = \u22121 from the non-phantom phase (wDE > \u22121) to the\n17\n\n\fphantom one (wDE < \u22121) in the combined f (T ) theory as shown in Fig. 7, and therefore the\nobservational data may favor the crossing of the phantom divide. This consequence agrees\nwith the one in Ref. [22].\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have investigated the cosmological evolution in the exponential f (T ) theory, which is\none of the simplest f (T ) theories as it contains only one model parameter p along with the\n(0)\n\ncurrent fractional density of non-relativistic matter \u03a9m . We have explicitly shown that the\nphase of the universe depends on the sign of the parameter p, i.e., for p < 0(> 0) the universe\nis always in the non-phantom (phantom) phase without the crossing of the phantom divide.\nWe have presented another simplest f (T ) model, which is the logarithmic type. Similar to\nthe exponential model, the logarithmic one has only one free parameter q, and it does not\nallow the crossing of the phantom divide. To realize the crossing of the phantom divide,\nwe have constructed a f (T ) theory by combining the logarithmic and exponential terms. In\nparticular, we have shown that the crossing in the combined f (T ) theory is from wDE > \u22121\nto wDE < \u22121, which is opposite to the typical manner in f (R) gravity models. Furthermore,\nwe have also illustrated that this combined theory is consistent with the recent observational\ndata of SNe Ia, BAO and CMB.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nOne of the authors (CQG) would like to thank the Institute of Theoretical Physics, Beijing\nfor hospitality and a wonderful program on \"Dark Energy and Dark Matter\" at Weihai, and\nProfessors Rong-Gen Cai, Yue-Liang Wu and Hongwei Yu for useful discussions.

The theoretical distance modulus \u03bcth is defined by\n\u03bcth (zi ) \u2261 5 log10 DL (zi ) + \u03bc0 ,\n\n(A1)\n\nwhere \u03bc0 \u2261 42.38 \u2212 5 log10 h with h \u2261 H0 /100/[km sec\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ] [36]. The Hubble-free\nluminosity distance for the flat universe is described as\nZ z\ndz \u2032\nDL (z) = (1 + z)\n,\n\u2032\n0 E(z )\n\n(A2)\n\nwhere E(z) \u2261 H(z)/H0 with\nq\n(0)\n(0)\n(0)\nH(z) = H0 \u03a9m (1 + z)3 + \u03a9r (1 + z)4 + \u03a9DE (1 + z)3(1+wDE ) .\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\n(A3)\n\n(0)\n\nHere, \u03a9r = \u03a9\u03b3 (1 + 0.2271Neff ), where \u03a9\u03b3 is the present fractional photon energy density\nand Neff = 3.04 is the effective number of neutrino species [4]. We note that H(z) is evaluated\nby using numerical solutions of Eq. (3.3).\nThe \u03c72 of the SNe Ia data is given by\n\u03c72SN =\n\nX [\u03bcobs (zi ) \u2212 \u03bcth (zi )]2\n\u03c3i2\n\ni\n\n,\n\n(A4)\n\nwhere \u03bcobs is the observed value of the distance modulus. In what follows, subscriptions\n\"th\" and \"obs\" denote the theoretically predicted and observed values, respectively. \u03c72SN\nshould be minimized with respect to \u03bc0 , which relates to the absolute magnitude, because\nthe absolute magnitude of SNe Ia is not known. \u03c72SN in Eq. (A4) is expanded to be [38]\n\u03c72SN = A \u2212 2\u03bc0 B + \u03bc20 C ,\n\n19\n\n(A5)\n\n\fwith\nA=\n\nX [\u03bcobs (zi ) \u2212 \u03bcth (zi ; \u03bc0 = 0)]2\n,\n2\n\u03c3\ni\ni\n\nB=\n\nX \u03bcobs (zi ) \u2212 \u03bcth (zi ; \u03bc0 = 0)\n,\n2\n\u03c3\ni\ni\n\nC=\n\nX 1\n.\n2\n\u03c3\ni\ni\n(A6)\n\nThe minimum of \u03c72SN with respect to \u03bc0 is expressed as\n\u03c7\u03032SN = A \u2212\n\nB2\n.\nC\n\n(A7)\n\nIn our analysis, we take Eq. (A7) for the \u03c72 minimization and use the Supernova Cosmology\nProject (SCP) Union2 compilation, which contains 557 supernovae [34], ranging from z =\n0.015 to z = 1.4.\n\n2.\n\nBaryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO)\n\nThe distance ratio of dz \u2261 rs (zd )/DV (z) is measured by the observation of BAO.
