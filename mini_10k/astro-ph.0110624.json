These are assumed to have\noriginated from quantum fluctuations during the inflationary epoch. The fluctuations form\na random field, which is fully specified by the n-point joint probability density functions\n(hereafter PDFs). The one-point PDF is a useful tool for testing the statistical character of\nthe initial conditions (i.e. whether they are Gaussian or others), since its evolution does not\ndepend on the nature of the dark matter (Trimble 1987). So it would be rather convenient\nto develop an efficient and accurate procedure for obtaining the present PDFs given that\nfor the initial conditions. Many attempts have been made at solving this problem. Hoffman\n(1987) used the Zel'dovich (1970) approximation for computing the variance of the density\nfluctuations in the mildly non-linear regime (\u03c3 2 \u2264 1). However, he did not take into account\nthe fact that evolution and filtering are non-commuting operations. To obtain the variance\non comoving scale r, one should evolve the whole field (with all its structure) and then filter\nit on scale r. But in the analytical procedure followed by Hoffman the field is first filtered\nand then evolved. In the linear regime (\u03c3 \u226a 1) both procedures lead to the same result.\nHowever, for \u03c3 \u223c 1 the results obtained by these procedures are rather different.\nA procedure for obtaining the present PDF given the statistics of the initial conditions,\nthat accounts for non-commutability of evolution and filtering was first described by one of\nus (Betancort-Rijo 1991). This procedure was the result of taking into account the simple\nfact that overdense regions with present comoving size r correspond to larger comoving\nregions in the initial field. However, in developing this idea a couple of subtle points were\ninvolved that were not properly dealt within that paper.\nDuring more than a decade that has passed since these first attempts at dealing with\nthe problem under consideration (the article by Betancort-Rijo was in fact written in 1988)\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nmuch attention have been given to it. New methods have been developed for approximating\nthe non-linear evolution (Buchert 1989; Bouchet et al. 1995) and for the computation\nof statistics of the evolved field. Bernardeau (1994a) developed a procedure for taking\ninto account the effect of filtering on the moments of the PDF in the small variance limit\nand used it to compute the first few hierarchical amplitudes. Then, assuming that these\nquantities do not depend on \u03c3, he obtained (Bernardeau & Kofman 1995) the present PDF\nfor any value of \u03c3. However, this assumption, although it holds for some initial conditions,\nis not universal (as we shall see) and, even when it holds, it is not easy to justify a priori.\nDespite all the attention that has been devoted to the present problem, the idea\ndescribed by Betancort-Rijo (1991), which is at the root of the possibility of developing a\nsimple and direct (it is not necessary to obtain the vertex generation function) procedure\nfor computing the present PDF in the non-linear regime analytically, has not been followed.\nThe exception is an article by Padmanabhan & Subramanian (1993), but there the problem\nis treated in the same way as was by Betancort-Rijo (1991), thereby having the same\ndrawbacks.\nIn this paper we shall show how to correct the errors included in previous work and\ngive the correct procedure for obtaining the present PDF. To check the correctness of the\nprocedure we compute the values of S3 and S4 in the low-\u03c3 limit (that have been computed\nanalytically by Bernardeau 1994a) for several power spectra. Our procedure should render\nthe exact values of all hierarchical amplitudes in this limit, and this is what is found for\nthese two amplitudes. We also study the dependence on \u03c3 of these amplitudes and of the\nvariance in the low limit and for finite values of \u03c3. We then compute the PDF explicitly for\nseveral cases for which numerical simulations are available and find them to agree with the\nnumerical results.\nIn \u00a73 we briefly review the basic idea (fully described in Betancort-Rijo 1991) involved\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nin the present approximation and show how to use it to derive correctly the present PDF\ngiven the initial one. In the second section we shall discuss the technique that we use for\nthe treatment of the non-linear evolution. In the last section we present and discuss the\nresults of several explicit calculations.\n\n2.\n\nNon-linear evolution\n\nThe complete Zel'dovich approximation (CZA; Betancort-Rijo & L\u00f3pez-Corredoira\n2000) is an approximation to the non-linear evolution of density fluctuations depending\nonly on three quantities, \u03bbi , defined so that that 1 \u2212 \u03bbi are the eigenvalues of the tensor\n\n\u2202~\nu\n,\n\u2202~\nq\n\nwhere ~u stands for the peculiar velocity of matter as given by the linear theory in comoving\nunits, i.e. the peculiar velocity ~v = R(t)~u; R(t) being the scale factor of the Universe\nand q stands for the Lagrangian coordinates, which are equal to the initial comoving\ncoordinates (Eulerian). This tensor we call the linear local deformation tensor. The full\nlocal deformation tensor is defined in the same manner but using the exact value of ~u. This\napproximation is exact to the second order. An approximation exact to the fourth order\nmay be obtained out of it but this implies introducing additional variables. It takes the\nform (Betancort-Rijo & L\u00f3pez-Corredoira 2000)\n\n(1 + \u03b4)\u22121 =\n\nY\ni\n\n(1 \u2212 ri (\u03bb)\u03bbi + f1 (\u03bb)xi + f2 (\u03bb)ui ),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere f1 , f2 , ri are certain functions of the variables \u03bbi . The variables x, u which are\ngiven at any point by certain integrals over the whole field (Betancort-Rijo 2001) but,\nfor statistical purposes we only need their probability distribution for fixed values of the\n\u03bbi . In fact, to obtain the moments exactly to the third order and almost exactly to the\nfourth we can use expression (1) with u equal to zero and x equal to its average value for\nfixed values of the \u03bbi (< xi > (\u03bb)). This is the approximation that in principle we use. It\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nhas a dependence on the power spectra through the mean value of x (see Betancort-Rijo\n& L\u00f3pez-Corredoira 2000). However, the dependence is so small that may be neglected\nwithout practical lost of accuracy. So, what we do in practice is to use simply the CZA\n(expression (1) with x = u = 0 ), which is strictly exact to the third order for a particular\npower spectra (such that < xi > (\u03bb) = 0) and practically exact for all of them. The CZA\ngives the density fluctuation at a point in term of the values of the \u03bbi at that point. When\ndealing with filtered fields, however, the relevant quantity is the mean density within certain\nregion (of any prescribed shape). It may be shown that this mean density fluctuation is also\ngiven exactly at least to the third order by expression (1) with the \u03bbi representing now the\nlinear eigenvalues of the deformation tensor corresponding to the filtered field; that is, the\ndeformation tensor derived from the peculiar velocity field corresponding to the growing\nmode of the filtered field. The x variables are now defined in a different manner. For\nnon-filtered fields the presence of this variables is due to the different rate of growth of the\nvarious contributions to the local tidal field. In the present case, however, these variables\nhave an extra component due to the filtering process. But, despite of the different origin of\nthe x variables, expression (1) and the probability distributions for the x retain their form\nat least up to third order. So, setting in this expression x equal to its mean value for fixed\n\u03bbi leads also to an approximation exact to third order (for statistical purposes) for filtered\nfields. There is, however, an important difference between the two mentioned contributions\nto the x, because the part due to the tidal field remains small for any power spectra while\nthat due to the averaging process grows indefinitely with increasing power on small scale.\nThis implies, as we shall find, that for power spectra with too much power on small scale\nthe procedure presented here fails even for values of \u03c3 smaller than one. However, even\nin these cases the results are exact to third order, but many orders contribute for finite\nbut small \u03c3. So, the steeper the power spectra the smaller the value of \u03c3 at which the\napproximation start failing. This happens, however, only for very steep power spectra not\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nvery relevant to cosmology. To deal with these cases we should use expression (1) with the\nmean values of x, not simply the CZA.\n\n3.\n\nPDF of the filtered field\n\nThe effect of filtering on the field of density fluctuations have been treated exactly by\nBernardeau (1994). In this treatment one may, in principle, obtaining (previously to caustic\nformation) all moments of the PDF of the field of density fluctuation filtered in some scale\nas a series of powers of \u03c3 and sometimes (when the corresponding Hedgeworth expansion\nconverges) to reconstruct the PDF. However, even when this works it is complicated. The\nprocedure described here to deal with this problem ,which is basically that in Betancort-Rijo\n(1991) is more immediate, allowing the direct evaluation of the PDF even for values of \u03c3\nwell above unity. Furthermore, it provides a clearer visualization of the effect of filtering.\nWe now describe the basic idea of our procedure using the CZA, although the procedure in\nitself is independent of the approximation used for the evolution.\nConsider certain geometrical body, B1 , centered at some point within the initial field.\nBy assigning to this point the mean value of the density fluctuation within B1 and repeating\nthe process for each point, we generate a new field which we call the field filtered within B1 .\nWe may now obtain the linear peculiar velocity field corresponding to the growing mode of\nthis field. Let \u03bbi (B1 ) be the proper values of the corresponding linear (linearly calculated)\ndeformation tensor, and let B2 be the body which is the result of transforming B1 with this\ndeformation tensor. The CZA, in the present context, must be written in the form:\n\n1 + \u03b4(B2 ) = (\n\n3\nY\n\n(1 \u2212 ri (~\u03bb(B1 ))\u03bbi (B1 )))\u22121 .\n\n(2)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere \u03b4 is the present value of the density fluctuations filtered with B2 at the point under\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nconsideration. In our problem, the filtering body B2 is a sphere of radius r and B1 is an\nellipsoid with semiaxis r(1 \u2212 ri (~\u03bb)\u03bbi )\u22121 . Hereafter, we write simply \u03bbi instead of \u03bbi (B1 ).\nIt must be noted that in the actual evolution the present sphere does not transform\n(when evolved back) exactly into an ellipsoid. The real surface has the same quadrupolar\ncomponent as the mentioned ellipsoid, but contains smaller wiggles. However, for the\npresent problem those wiggles are completely irrelevant.\nEquation (2) gives the best one-point expression for \u03b4 as given by the CZA\napproximation. By one-point expression we mean that the value of \u03b4 at a given point (the\nmean value within a B2 centered at that point) is expressed only in terms of the \u03bbi at that\npoint (the mean value within B1 ). To go beyond this approximation, we need to obtain the\nvalues of the \u03bbi at different points and integrate over them, or, what is the same, to include\nthe x variables described in the previous section.\nIt should be noted that in equation (2) the \u03bbi depend on B1 , which, in turn, depends\non the \u03bbi (for a given B2 ). It is possible to show that, as long as caustics do not form, for\nevery point there is a unique ellipsoid (with certain axis and orientation) such that the local\ndeformation tensor of the field filtered with the ellipsoid transforms that same ellipsoid into\na sphere of radius r (B2 in general). This prescription uniquely determines the values of the\n\u03bbi (hence, \u03b4) at any given point. These unique \u03bbi (for a given B2 ) we call \u03bb\u2032i . We must now\nobtain the PDF for the \u03bb\u2032i at a randomly chosen point in the initial field. With this PDF\nand equation (2), the derivation of the PDF for \u03b4 is a standard problem.\nFor a field filtered with a given body (the same at every point; usually a sphere of given\nradius), the PDF for the \u03bbi is given by (Doroshkevich 1970):\n\nP (\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , \u03bb3 , \u03c3) =\n\u00d7 exp\n\n\u0014\n\n55/2 27\n(\u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb2 )(\u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb3 )(\u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bb3 )\n8\u03c0\u03c3 6\n\n15\n\u22121\n2\n3(\u03bb\n+\n\u03bb\n+\n\u03bb\n)\n\u2212\n(\u03bb1 \u03bb2 + \u03bb2 \u03bb3 + \u03bb1 \u03bb3 )\n1\n2\n3\n\u03c32\n2\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\n;\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n\u03c3 2 \u2261 h\u03b4L2 i = h(\u03bb1 + \u03bb2 + \u03bb3 )2 i; \u03bb3 < \u03bb2 < \u03bb1 .\n\n(3)\n\n\u03c3 2 is the variance of the initial field of density fluctuations, \u03b4L , filtered with the\ngiven body and extrapolated linearly to the present time. The trace of the deformation\ntensor extrapolated linearly to the present time (is given the tensor used in the Zel'dovich\napproximation) by \u03b4L . Betancort-Rijo (1991) and Padmanabhan & Subramanian (1993)\ntook the PDF for the \u03bb\u2032i to be simply proportional to the PDF for the \u03bbi (with \u03bbi = \u03bb\u2032i ) for\nthe field filtered with the ellipsoid that will contract to a sphere of radius r; that is, with\nan ellipsoid with semiaxis r(1 \u2212 ri (\u03bb~\u2032 )\u03bb\u2032i )\u22121 . Note that now the filtering body changes from\none point to another, so \u03c3 is no longer a constant but a function of the \u03bb\u2032i .\n\u03c3 (\u03bb~\u2032 , r) =\n2\n\n1\n(2\u03c0)3\n\nW (F ) =\nwith F =\n\nqP\n\ni\n\nZ\n\n~\nW (F )2 P (K)d3K;\n\n3[sin F \u2212 F cos F ]\nF3\n\n(4)\n\n~ P (K) \u2261 power spectra.\nKi2 Ei2 r; Ei = (1 \u2212 ri (\u03bb~\u2032 )\u03bb\u2032i )\u22121 , K = |K|;\n\nIn practice, in the papers mentioned and, to some extent, here, instead of the full\nequation (4) a more convenient approximation is used. Since \u03c3 depends mainly on the\nvolume of the filtering body (this is exactly so for white-noise power spectra), only the\ndependence on this quantity is considered. We then have:\n\n\u03c3 2 (\u03bb~\u2032 , r) = \u03c3 2 (~0, r(\n\n3\nY\n\n(1\u2212ri (\u03bb~\u2032 )\u03bb\u2032i )\u22121/3 )) \u2261 \u03c3 2 (r(\n\ni=1\n\n3\nY\n\n(1\u2212ri (\u03bb~\u2032 )\u03bb\u2032i )\u22121/3 )) = \u03c3 2 (r(1+\u03b4)1/3 ), (5)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere \u03c3 2 (r) is the variance of the linear field filtered with a sphere of radius r. However, if\nwe want to obtain results which are exact to the fourth order,as we shall do in some cases,\nthe small shape dependence of \u03c3(~\u03bb, r) must be taken into account. In these cases, we use\nthe following excellent approximation to the actual shape dependence of \u03c3:\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\u03c3 2 (~\u03bb, r) = \u03c3 2 (r(1 + \u03b4)1/3 )Z 2 (~\u03bb)\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8eb\n\nB X\uf8ed\n1 \u2212 \u03bbi\nZ(~\u03bb) \u2248 exp \uf8f0\u2212\nln\n2 i<j\n1 \u2212 \u03bbj\n\n!2 \uf8f6\uf8f9\n\uf8f8\uf8fb\n\n(6)\n\nTo compute the constant B in the exponential we may use the exact form of Z in the\ncase when two of the \u03bb are equal. In this case and for power law power spectra (with index\nn) expression (5) reduces to:\n2n\n\nZ(P, n) =\n\nP\u2212 3\n\nR\u221e R\u221e\n0\n\nP \u2261\n\n0\n\n\u221a\nn\n(u2 + P 2 s2 ) 2 (W ( u2 + s2 ))2 s ds du\nR\u221e\n2\n2+n du\n0 W (u)u\n\n1 \u2212 \u03bb3\n; \u03bb1 = \u03bb2 6= \u03bb3\n1 \u2212 \u03bb1\n\n(7)\n\nWe find: B(n = \u22122)=0.0486; B(n = \u22121)=0.0499; B(n = 0)=0.\nThe approximation used in the mentioned works (which use expression (5)) may be\nexpressed in the form:\n\nP \u2032(\u03bb~\u2032 , \u03c3) = C P (~\u03bb, \u03c3(r(1 + \u03b4(~\u03bb))1/3 ))|~\u03bb=\u03bb~\u2032 ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere P \u2032 is the PDF of the \u03bb\u2032i ; \u03b4(~\u03bb) is given by equation (2) (with x=u=o); \u03c3 stands for\n\u03c3(r), and C is a normalization constant. This constant has to be introduced because, unlike\nP , the integral of P \u2032 over all \u03bb~\u2032 space is not equal to unity, due to the dependence of \u03c3 on ~\u03bb.\nWe now show why equation (8) is incorrect and give the correct one. To this end\nwe consider an approximation in which \u03b4 depends only on \u03b4L (\u2261 \u03bb1 + \u03bb2 + \u03bb3 ). We do\nthis because the relevant fact at this point is basically the same with one and with three\nvariables, but it is much easier to understand in the former case.\nFor definiteness, let us assume that:\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\u03b4L\n1+\u03b4 = 1\u2212\n3\n\n!\u22123\n\n,\n\n(9)\n\nan approximation that has been used in Betancort-Rijo (1991).\nFor Gaussian initial conditions, \u03b4L , which corresponds to a fixed filtering scale, follows\na normal distribution. To obtain the PDF for \u03b4L\u2032 (the value of \u03b4L within the sphere of\nradius r/(1 \u2212\n\n\u03b4L\n)\n3\n\nthat have contracted at present to the sphere of radius r) that, by means\n\nof equation (9), allows us to obtain the PDF for \u03b4, we proceed as follows. To say that at a\ngiven point \u03b4L\u2032 takes the value \u03b4L0 means that at this point the linear value of \u03b4 filtered with\na sphere of radius r/ (1 \u2212 \u03b4L /3) is just \u03b4L0 . The accumulated probability, P \u2032 (\u03b4L\u2032 \u2265 \u03b4L0 ), that\nat a point chosen at random in the initial field \u03b4L\u2032 is larger than or equal to some given value\nmay be obtained immediately. To this end we only need noting that if a sphere of radius\nr/(1 \u2212 \u03b4L\u2032 /3) (with \u03b4L\u2032 \u2265 \u03b4L0 ) have to contract to a sphere of radius r and shell crossing does\nnot happen, the sphere of radius r/(1 \u2212 \u03b4L0 /3) will have to contract to a radius smaller than\nr. So, the value of \u03b4L within the sphere with radius R/(1 \u2212 \u03b4L0 /3) must be larger than \u03b4L0 ,\nsince if the value of \u03b4L within this sphere were just \u03b4L0 it would contract to a sphere of radius\nr. Thus, the accumulated probability under consideration must be equal to the probability\nthat the value of \u03b4L within a sphere of radius r/(1 \u2212 \u03b4L0 /3) be larger than or equal to \u03b4L0 .\nSo, we have\n\u03b40\n1\nP \u2032 (\u03b4L\u2032 \u2265 \u03b4L0 ) = erfc \u221a L 0\n2\n2\u03c3(\u03b4L )\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03b40\n\u03c3(\u03b4L0 ) = \u03c3 \uf8edr 1 \u2212 L\n3\n\n!\u22121 \uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\n!\n\n(10)\n\nwhere erfc stands for the error complementary function. To obtain the probability\ndistribution for the values of \u03b4L\u2032 (the value of \u03b4L within the sphere that will contract to\na sphere of radius r) at a randomly chosen point we only need deriving the cumulative\nprobability with respect to \u03b4L0 .\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n\nP \u2032 (\u03b4L\u2032 ) = \u2212\n\nd \u2032\nP (\u03b4L > \u03b4L0 )|\u03b4L0 =\u03b4L\u2032 ;\nd\u03b4L0\n!\n\n1\n\u03b4L\u2032\n\u20322\n2 \u2032\nP \u2032 (\u03b4L\u2032 )d\u03b4L\u2032 = \u221a e\u2212\u03b4L /(2\u03c3 (\u03b4L )) d\n.\n\u03c3(\u03b4L\u2032 )\n2\u03c0\n\n(11)\n\nNote that since \u03c3 depends on \u03b4L\u2032 we cannot take it out of the differential. So we cannot\nwrite:\n\nP \u2032(\u03b4L\u2032 ) = C P (\u03b4L , \u03c3(\u03b4L ))|\u03b4L =\u03b4L\u2032\n\u20322\n\n2\n\n\u2032\n\ne\u2212\u03b4L /(2\u03c3 (\u03b4L ))\n=C \u221a\n,\n2\u03c0\u03c3(\u03b4L\u2032 )\ncontrary to the assumption in equation (8). With these considerations in mind, it is easy to\nobtain the correct distribution for the \u03bb\u2032i . We need only to generalize the above argument\nto three dimensions. The key argument is that the variables \u03bb\u2032i /\u03c3(\u03bb~\u2032 ) must follow the\ndistribution followed by the variable \u03bbi /\u03c3 for fixed filtering (when \u03c3 is a constant). So we\nhave:\n\uf8eb\n\nP \u2032 (\u03bb~\u2032 , \u03c3) = \uf8edP (~\u03bb, \u03c3(~\u03bb))\u03c3 3 (~\u03bb)\n\ni\n\u2202 \u03c3(\u03bb~\u03bb)\n\n\u2202\u03bbj\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8 |~\n\n\u03bb=\u03bb~\u2032 ;\n\n\u03c3(~\u03bb) \u2261 \u03c3(~\u03bb, r).\n\n(12)\n\nThe last factor in this expression is the Jacobian of the transformation from the\nvariables \u03bbi /\u03c3(\u03bbi ) to the variables \u03bbi . Note that the P \u2032 obtained by means of this expression\nis automatically normalized.\nEquation (12) is exact for any initial conditions (provided that the \u03bbi determine the\nevolution), although we shall use it only for Gaussian initial conditions; that is, with P\ngiven by equation (3).\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nP \u2032 is the PDF of the \u03bb\u2032i (the \u03bbi associated with the unique ellipsoid that will contract to\nthe sphere of radius r centered at the given point) for a point chosen at random in the initial\nfield; that is, in Lagrangian coordinates. However, we want to obtain the PDF for \u03b4 at a\npoint chosen at random in the present \"physical\" coordinates (i.e. Eulerian coordinates).\nSo, we must first obtain the PDF for the \u03bb\u2032i in Eulerian coordinates. To this end, we only\nneed to multiply P \u2032 by the Jacobian of the transformation from Lagrangian to Eulerian\ncoordinates. For a non-filtered field this Jacobian is simply\n\n3\nY\n\ni=1\n\n(1 \u2212 ri (~\u03bb)\u03bbi ).\n\n(13)\n\nHowever, for filtered fields this expression is not correct. This can be appreciated\nby noting that the resulting distribution for the \u03bb\u2032i (the result of multiplying P \u2032 by the\nJacobian in question) is not normalized. For non-filtered fields, on the other hand, it is easy\nto check that the Jacobian given by equation (13) leads to a normalized PDF. The correct\nJacobian must exhibit the following properties: it has to be zero at points where \u03b4 goes to\ninfinity; it must reduce to expression (13) in the limit of small power on scales below r; it\nmust render a normalized PDF with vanishing first moment for any power spectra. The\nfollowing expression meets these requirements and is exact at least to first order\n\nJ(\u03bb) =\n\n(1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b3)ri (~\u03bb)\u03bbi ),\n\nY\ni\n\n(14)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is certain spectral constant that tends to zero in the limit of small power on\nscales below r. We cannot say a priori whether this expression is exact to higher orders.\nHowever,it seems to be exact to second order (within the precision of our computations)\nand it gives excellent results to all orders. It must be noted that expression (14) is not the\nvalue of the Jacobian at a point with the given \u03bbi . This would be so if the evolution were\ndetermined solely by these quantities. However, we know that this it is not strictly true, so\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nexpression (14) should represent the mean value of the Jacobian over all points with a given\nvalue of the \u03bbi . To obtain \u03b3 we have considered a fluctuation with spherical symmetry\nand the evolution of the region such that the mean density fluctuation within a sphere\ncentered at points belonging to it is above some threshold. Using the spherical model with\nthe mean density profile, we obtained the contraction of this region and by comparison\nwith expression (14) we find \u03b3. However, this derivation is lengthy and although it might\nbe interesting in itself, it is not essential to the present purposes, since we may obtain that\nconstant using any relevant analytical result available (i.e., the leading order value of S3 )\nand comparing it with the one obtained using expression (14). In either case, we find:\n\n\u03b3=\n\n4.\n\n1 d[ln(\u03c3 2 (r))]\n6 d[ln(r)]\n\n(15)\n\nResults and conclusions\n\nTo check the accuracy of the approximation developed in this article, we shall present\nsome explicit calculations and compare them with the results of the corresponding available\nnumerical simulation and with exact results obtained with the perturbation theory. We\nshall consider Gaussian initial conditions with power spectra of the form P (k) = Ck n .\nIn these cases, equation (5) takes the form:\n\u03c3(~\u03bb, r) = \u03c30 (1 + \u03b4)\u2212\u03b1/2 ;\nn+3\n,\n3\n\n(16)\n\n(1 \u2212 ri (\u03bb)\u03bbi )\n\n(17)\n\n\u03c30 \u2261 \u03c3(r); \u03b1 \u2261\nwith \u03b4 given by the CZA\n\n(1 + \u03b4)\u22121 =\n\nY\ni\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nTo derive exact results we use for ri (\u03bb) its exact expression (Betancort-Rijo &\nL\u00f3pez-Corredoira 2000). To derive result for finite values, however, we find it much more\nconvenient to use the following compact approximation\n\nri (\u03bb) = g\n\ng(x, \u03a9) =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\n3\nx\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0012\n\n3\n(\u03bbJ + \u03bbK ), \u03a9\n2\n\n\u0013\n\nx\u03a92/63\n1.66\n\n1\u2212\n\n1.55\n\n\u00110.5533\n\n;x \u2264 1.584\n;x > 1.584\n\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fd\n\n(18)\n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\n\nUsing this in expression (12), with P (~\u03bb, \u03c3) given by (3) and multiplying it by the\nEulerian\u2013Lagrangian Jacobian, J(~\u03bb, \u03b1), (expression (14)), we obtain the PDF for the \u03bb\u2032i\ncorresponding to a point chosen at random in Eulerian coordinates, which we represent by\nG(\u03bb~\u2032 , \u03c30 ):\n\uf8eb\uf8eb\n\nG(\u03bb~\u2032 , \u03c30 ) = \uf8ed\uf8edP (~\u03bb, \u03c3(~\u03bb))\u03c3 3 (~\u03bb)\n\n\u03bbi\n\u2202 \u03c3(\u03bb)\n\n\u2202\u03bbj\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\n~\n\u03bb=\u03bb~\u2032\n\n\uf8f6\n\n~\u2032 , \u03b1).\n\uf8f8 J(\u03bb\n\n(19)\n\nThe moments of the PDF of the present value of the density fluctuation top-hat filtered\non scale r are then given by:\n\nn\n\nh\u03b4 i(\u03c30 ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nd\u03bb\u20321\n\nZ\n\n\u03bb\u20321\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nd\u03bb\u20322\n\nZ\n\n\u03bb\u20322\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nd\u03bb\u20323 G(\u03bb~\u2032 , \u03c30 )\u03b4 n ,\n\n(20)\n\nwhere \u03b4 is given by equations (17) with ~\u03bb = \u03bb~\u2032 , provided that each of the factors in (17) is\npositive and \u03b4 is smaller than 170. If this expression leads to a value of \u03b4 larger than this,\nwe use the following expression:\n3\n\n\u03b4L\n\u03b4 = 170\n.\n1.589\nThis last prescription represents an attempt to deal with caustic formation in a simple\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nmanner, so that equation (23) gives sensible results for any value of \u03c3. However, it is not\nrelevant for the results given here.\nThe PDF for \u03b4, P (\u03b4, \u03c30 ), may be obtained in the very process of computing any of the\nmoments. To this end, we add up all the values of G(~\u03bb, \u03b1) (multiplied by the corresponding\nvolume of the integration step) that are found during the integration to lie between \u03b4 and\n\u03b4 + \u2206\u03b4 (for a suitably chosen \u2206\u03b4, depending on \u03b4) and divide the result by \u2206\u03b4.\nThe values of \u03b4 given by (17) for very under dense regions is not correct this imply\nh\u03b4i =\n6 0. However, this problem disappears if we set P (\u03b4) = 0 for \u03b4 < \u22120.82.\nThe values of S3 and S4 given by\n\nS3 \u2261\n\nh\u03b4 3 i\nh\u03b4 4 i \u2212 3h\u03b4 2 i2\n;\nS\n\u2261\n4\nh\u03b4 2 i2\nh\u03b4 2 i3\n\nin the low-\u03c3 limit, may be computed analytically.\n\nThe exact value of\n\nS3 (\u03c3 = 0) = (34/7 \u2212 (n + 3)) is obtained, for the power spectra under consideration, when\nexpression (17) for \u03b4 is used; the value 4 \u2212 (n + 3) is found when the ri are set equal to\none. For a non-filtered field we have computed S4 (\u03c3 = 0) analytically both for the CZA\n(equation (17)) and for the Zel'dovich approximation. Note that the non-filtered case may\nbe treated formally as a filtered field with negligible power below the filtering scale, so that\nwe may use expression (30) with \u03c3 independent of \u03bb and \u03b3 = 0. For power law power\nspectra this corresponds to the limit n = \u22123, but it corresponds more generally to any\npower spectra having the mentioned properties. The correct values (60712/1323; 279/9;\nBernardeau 1994a) are found. For the evolution of these amplitudes and the variance in the\nsmall \u03c3 limit we find\nh\u03b4 2 i = \u03c3 2 + 1.81\u03c3 4 + 3.8\u03c3 6\nS3 = 4.86 + 9.815\u03c3 2 + 48\u03c3 4\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nS4 = 45.89 + 288.8\u03c3 2 + 2072\u03c3 4\n\n(21)\n\nThis results are exact to next leading order for S3 (in principle only for n = \u22122.7\nbut the n dependence is negligible) and almost exact to the same order for h\u03b4 2 i, S4 . As\npointed out in section 2, we could use the statistical properties of the x, u variables to\nobtain these two quantities exactly to the stated order, but the second coefficient in the\nexpansion for h\u03b4 2 i will increase by less than a per cent which is about the numerical error\nfor this coefficient. So, it would be an unnecessary complication to use here those additional\nvariables. Furthermore, the purpose of the present procedure is to obtain directly and\naccurately the PDF for finite values of \u03c3. The question of the maximum order of exactness,\nalthough interesting, is only of peripheral relevance to our purposes. These results agree\nwith those exact results given by the perturbation theory by Scoccimarro & Frieman (1995)\nand the remaining ones are close to those obtained by Fosalba and Gazta\u00f1aga (1998) using\nthe spherical model. We see that this model predict well the hierarchical amplitudes but\nnot so well the moments. The above results provide a check to the CZA but not properly to\nthe procedure presented here, since for non-filtered fields expressions (12) and (14) reduce\nto the standard form. A check to these expressions is provided by the cases of power law\npower spectra with n \u2265 \u22123. For n = \u22122 we find:\nh\u03b4 2 i = \u03c3 2 + 0.88\u03c3 4 + 0.54\u03c3 6\nS3 = 3.86 + 3.12\u03c3 2\nS4 = 27.56 + 58\u03c3 2\n\n(22)\n\nHere, to obtain the second coefficient in h\u03b4 2 i exactly we have considered the small\n(=0.015) contribution due to the dispersion of the x variables. This is not necessary for\nthe amplitudes. It is also important to consider the shape dependence of \u03c3 (see expression\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\n(6)), otherwise we would obtain a coefficient 0.1 too large. For n = \u22121, n = 1 we find\nrespectively:\n\nh\u03b4 2 i = \u03c3 2 + 0.223\u03c3 4\nS3 = 2.86 + 0.267\u03c3 2\nS4 = 13.89 \u2212 2.583\u03c3 2\nh\u03b4 2 i = \u03c3 2 \u2212 0.173\u03c3 4\nS3 = 0.86 + 0.8\u03c3 2\nS4 = 0.556 \u2212 17.8\u03c3 2\n\n(23)\n\nFor n \u2265 \u22121.5, S3 and S4 are practically independent of \u03c3. For example, for n = \u22121.3\nthe change of these quantities up to \u03c3 = 1.52 is less than a 4%. For smaller values of n,\nhowever, the evolution of this quantities is more apparent. For n = \u22122 we find (table 1) that\nS3 and S4 increase considerably from \u03c3 = 0 to \u03c3 \u2248 0.5 and more steeply for higher values\nof \u03c3. In figure 1 we present the PDF for \u03b4 corresponding to P (k) \u221d k \u22121 and \u03c3 = 0.3; 0.5.\nComparing this with figure 7 of Bernardeau & Koffman (1995), we find them to be almost\nidentical. The PDFs of Bernadeau & Koffman were obtained under the assumption that\nthe Sp parameters (the p-th cumulants divided by \u03c3 2(p\u22121) ) are independent of \u03c3. We have\nseen that this is the case for n = \u22121, at least for S3 and S4 . So, the agreement between\nboth pairs of PDFs is to be expected. The evolution of h\u03b4 2 i agrees very well with the result\nby Lokas et al. (1996).\nIn figure 2 the PDFs corresponding to \u03c3 = 0.92; 1.52, n = \u22121.3 are represented. These\nshould be compared with figure 10 of Bernardeau & Kofman (1995). The agreement is\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nvery good, our results being always within the numerical errors of the results given in that\narticle.\nIt should be noted that the mentioned numerical results assume a cold dark matter\n(CDM) while we have used a power-law power spectrum with the same local logarithmic\nderivative. Using the whole CDM power spectrum in our computations would represent\nonly a small complication. If we have not done so, it is because this implies only a slight\nimprovement in the results that is completely unobservable given the precision of the\nsimulations.\nThe procedure described here for obtaining the PDF for \u03b4 is in principle valid only\nfor top-hat filtered fields. However, the basic lines of reasoning followed here are entirely\ntranslatable to another smoothing procedures.\nFor a given smoothing (in the present field), we must determine the smoothing in\nthe initial field rendering the minimum dispersion for the smoothed present field. That\nis, we must find a smoothing procedure that, when applied to the initial field at a given\npoint, renders a set of \u03bb\u2032i (extrapolated linearly to the present time) that predict the mean\nvalue of \u03b4 at the transformed point, given by an expression similar to (17), and so that\nthe dispersion in \u03b4 for given \u03bb\u2032i s is a minimum. This is what we have implicitly done here\nfor the spherical top-hat smoothing, and we have found that it corresponds to an initial\nellipsoidal top-hat smoothing.\nThe solution to this problem for Gaussian smoothing is not simple, although one could\nguess that a triaxial Gaussian, with the axes determined as in the top-hat case, should not\nbe a bad approximation. Within this simple approximation and for a power-law spectrum\nthe PDF for \u03b4 must be the same as for the top-hat case with the same \u03c3. For more general\npower spectra, we cannot decide a priori whether the value of the logarithmic derivative\nmust be taken on the scale where the top-hat has the same volume as the Gaussian or on\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nthe scale where it has the same \u03c3.\nAs an example we discuss one of the cases represented in figure 4 of Kofman et al.\n(1994), where the Gaussian smoothing radius is Rs = 6h\u22121 Mpc; \u03c3 = 0.55. If we matched\nthe volumes, the corresponding top-hat radius is 9.38 h\u22121 Mpc, so that for a CDM power\nspectrum n \u2248 \u22121. The PDF corresponding to a top-hat filtering with \u03c3 = 0.55; n = \u22121 is\nrepresented in figure 3 and shows very good agreement with the numerical results in the\nlast reference. If we matched the \u03c3's, the corresponding top-hat smoothing scale imply\nn = \u22121.1. The corresponding PDF is almost indistinguishable from the former.\nWe have seen that to obtain the PDF for \u03b4 we must integrate over all values of \u03bb\nsubject to the condition \u03b4(\u03bb) = \u03b4. If we considered, however, an approximation where \u03b4\ndepended on the \u03bbi only through \u03b4L = \u03bb1 + \u03bb2 + \u03bb3 , the computation of P (\u03b4) would be\ngreatly simplified. We have already seen that such an approximation cannot be entirely\ncorrect, but leads to a simple analytical expression that displays, in a clear manner, the\neffect of smoothing. Taking for \u03b4(\u03b4L ) that corresponding to spherical collapse and using the\nfact that the distribution for \u03b4L is simply a Gaussian, equation (11) and (14) immediately\ngives for P (\u03b4):\n\u2212\n\n\u03b4 2 (\u03b4)\nL\n2\u03c3 2 (\u03b4)\n\n\u03b1\n1\ne\n(1 + \u03b4)\u22120.602 + \u03b4L (\u03b4)\nP (\u03b4) = \u221a\n2\n2\u03c0 \u03c3(\u03b4)(1 + \u03b4)\n\u0012\n\n\u03b1 \u03b4L (\u03b4)\n\u00d7 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 )\n2 1.66\n\u03c3(\u03b4) = \u03c30 (1 + \u03b4)\u2212\u03b1/2 ;\n\n!1.66\n\n\u03b1\u2261\n\n\u0013\n\n;\n\nn+3\n3\n\n\u03b4L (\u03b4) = 1.66(1 \u2212 (1 + \u03b4)\u22120.6024 ).\n\n(24)\n\nWhere the last equation represents a very accurate approximation to the spherical\nmodel that we propose. However, expression (24) represents only a rough approximation to\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nP (\u03b4). For \u03c3 = 1.52 the value of P (\u03b4) given by (24) may differ from the real value by a factor\ngreater than three. Furthermore, the value of S3 (\u03c3 = 0) given by (24) is 37/7 \u2212 (n + 3),\nwhich is 3/7 too large.\nWe may conclude that for \u03b4 \u2208 (\u22120.9, 10) and \u03c3 as large as 1.52, the P (\u03b4) computed\nas indicated here is, so far as we have been able to check, in excellent agreement with\nthe results of numerical simulations. This agreement is particularly meaningful since our\nderivation of P (\u03b4) involves neither free parameters nor modeling freedom (except for\nsome minute refinements non-essential for the results given here). Equation (12) is exact\nand is valid for any field. Equation (14) for the Jacobian of the Eulerian\u2013Lagrangian\ntransformation in a filtered field is also exact (at least to first order in \u03bbi ) and, although\nderived for a Gaussian field, it seems to be valid for any field.\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nREFERENCES\nBernardeau, F. 1994a, ApJ, 433, 1\nBernardeau, F. 1994b, ApJ, 427, 51\nBernardeau, F., & Kofman L. 1995, ApJ, 443, 479\nBetancort-Rijo, J. 1991, MNRAS, 251, 399\nBetancort-Rijo J., L\u00f3pez-Corredoira M., 2000, ApJ 534, L117\nBetancort-Rijo J., 2001, in preparation\nBouchet, F.
