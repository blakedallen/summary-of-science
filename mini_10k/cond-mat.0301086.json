Examples range from financial markets\nto communication and transportation systems. In many realistic situations the flow of physical quantities in the\nnetwork, as characterized by the loads on nodes, is important. We show that for such networks where loads can\nredistribute among the nodes, intentional attacks can lead to a cascade of overload failures, which can in turn\ncause the entire or a substantial part of the network to collapse. This is relevant for real-world networks that\npossess a highly heterogeneous distribution of loads, such as the Internet and power grids.

This brings obvious concerns on the security of such systems.\nPACS numbers: 89.20.Hh, 89.75.-k, 05.10.-a\n\nComplex networks are an essential part of a modern society [1, 2]. It has been shown that many networks, such as the\nworld-wide web (WWW), the Internet, and electrical power\ngrids, present a surprisingly small average distance between\nnodes and a highly organized distribution of links per node\n[3, 4, 5]. Generally, the average distance will not be affected\nby the removal of a random subset of nodes, but it will increase significantly if the removed nodes are among the most\nconnected ones [3] (see also Refs. [6, 7, 8]). The existence of\na giant connected component in the network, however, does\nnot depend on the presence of highly connected nodes. For\ninstance, the WWW has homepages with many thousands of\nhyperlinks and can remain well connected after the removal of\nall homepages with five or more hyperlinks [9]. In addition,\nthe giant component itself is typically a small-world network\n[10] even after the removal of all highly connected nodes [11].\nThese pioneering studies on network security address mainly\nstatic properties, i.e., the effect of different network architectures. They suggest that the network connectivity, and hence\nits functionability, is robust against random failure of nodes\n[3, 6, 7] and to some extent is even robust against intentional\nattacks [9, 11]. Here we show that for many physical networks, the removal of nodes can have a much more devastating consequence when the intrinsic dynamics of flows of\nphysical quantities in the network is taken into account. In a\npower transmission grid, for instance, each node (power station) deals with a load of power. The removal of nodes, either\nby random breakdown or intentional attacks, changes the balance of flows and leads to a global redistribution of loads over\nall the network. This can trigger a cascade of overload failures [12, 13], as the one that happened on August 10, 1996 in\nthe western United States power grid [14, 15]. Another example is the Internet [16, 17, 18], where the load represents the\namount of information a node (router) is requested to transmit\nper unit of time, and overloads correspond to congestion [19].\nInternet collapses caused by congestion have been reported\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: motter@chaos3.la.asu.edu\n\nsince its very beginning [20]. In this Rapid Communication,\nwe introduce a model for cascading failure in complex networks and show that it is applicable to realistic networks such\nas the Internet and power grids.\nFor a given network, suppose that at each time step one unit\nof the relevant quantity, which can be information, energy,\netc., is exchanged between every pair of nodes and transmitted\nalong the shortest path connecting them. The load at a node\nis then the total number of shortest paths passing through the\nnode [21, 22, 23]. The capacity of a node is the maximum load\nthat the node can handle. In man-made networks, the capacity\nis severely limited by cost. Thus, it is natural to assume that\nthe capacity Cj of node j is proportional to its initial load Lj ,\nCj = (1 + \u03b1)Lj , j = 1, 2, ...N,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the constant \u03b1 \u2265 0 is the tolerance parameter, and N\nis the initial number of nodes. When all the nodes are on, the\nnetwork operates in a free-flow state insofar as \u03b1 \u2265 0. But,\nthe removal of nodes in general changes the distribution of\nshortest paths. The load at a particular node can then change.\nIf it increases and becomes larger than the capacity, the corresponding node fails. Any failure leads to a new redistribution\nof loads and, as a result, subsequent failures can occur. This\nstep-by-step process is what we call a cascading failure, or a\ncascade. It can stop after a few steps but it can also propagate\nand shutdown a considerable fraction of the whole network\n[24]. A fundamental question is: under what conditions can\nsuch a global cascade take place?\nHere we focus on cascades triggered by the removal of a\nsingle node. If a node has a relatively small load, its removal will not cause major changes in the balance of loads,\nand subsequent overload failures are unlikely to occur. However, when the load at the node is relatively large, its removal\nis likely to affect significantly loads at other nodes and possibly starts a sequence of overload failures. Our result is the\nfollowing: global cascades occur if (1) the network exhibits\na highly heterogeneous distribution of loads; (2) the removed\nnode is among those with higher load. Otherwise, cascades\nare not expected. The distribution of loads is in turn highly\n\n\f2\ncorrelated with the distribution of links: networks with heterogeneous distribution of links are expected to be heterogeneous with respect to load so that on average, nodes with\nlarger number of links will have higher load [22]. This result confirms the robust-yet-fragile property of heterogeneous\nnetworks, which was first observed in Ref. [3] for the attack\non several nodes. The cascade effect is important, however,\nbecause a large damage can be caused in this case by the attack on a single node. While a network with more links can\nbe more resistant against cascading failures, in practice the\nnumber of links is limited by cost.\nNow we provide evidence for our result. We study cascades\ntriggered by random breakdown and by intentional attacks. To\nsimulate the former, we choose a trigger at random among all\nthe nodes of the network, as can occur in networks such as\npower grids [14]. In the case of attack the targeted node is selected from those with highest loads or largest degrees (number of links at a node). We consider heterogeneous networks\nwith algebraic (scale-free) distribution P of links, as observed\nin real systems [2, 5, 25, 26],\nP (k) \u223c k \u2212\u03b3 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere k denotes the degree and \u03b3 the scaling exponent, and\ncompare them with an equivalent homogeneous configuration.\nThese networks are generated according to the procedure in\nRefs. [27, 28], where the nodes are connected randomly for\na given degree distribution, and self- and repeated links are\nforbidden. The damage caused by a cascade is quantified in\nterms of the relative size G of the largest connected component,\nG = N \u2032 /N,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere N and N \u2032 are the numbers of nodes in the largest component before and after the cascade, respectively.\nFigure 1 shows the relative size G of the largest component\nafter cascading, as a function of the tolerance parameter \u03b1,\nfor a scale-free network. We can see that on average G remains close to unity in the case of random breakdowns but it\nis significantly reduced under intentional attacks, even for \u03b1\nunrealistically large. Indeed, the size of the largest component\nis reduced by more than 20% for \u03b1 = 1, i.e., for a capacity\nas large as two times the capacity required for the system to\noperate when all the nodes function normally. This result is\nin agreement with intuition, because in the case of random\nbreakdown the trigger is probably one of the many nodes with\nsmall load, while in the case of intentional attack it is a node\nwith very large load. The damage is larger for smaller values of \u03b1, as it is for load-based attacks when compared with\ndegree-based attacks. For instance, in the load-based attack\nfor \u03b1 = 0.2, more than 60% of the nodes are affected. For the\n5000-node networks used in our simulations, it means that a\ncascade triggered by the attack on a single node shuts down\nand disconnects more than 3000 others!\nFigure 2 shows the corresponding results for a homogeneous network with the same number of nodes and exactly\n3 links per node. To make a meaningful comparison we display in the inset results for an algebraic network with about\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\nG\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n\u03b1\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nFIG. 1: Cascading failure in scale-free networks, as triggered by\nthe removal of a single node chosen at random (squares), or among\nthose with largest degrees (asterisks) or highest loads (circles), where\n\u03b1 is the tolerance parameter and G is the relative size of the largest\nconnected component. Each curve corresponds to the average over\n5 triggers and 10 realizations of the network. The error bars represent the standard deviation. The networks are generated according\nto the algebraic distribution (2). For the computations shown we set\n\u03b3 = 3 and 5000 \u2264 N \u2264 5100. The average degree in the largest\ncomponent is hki \u2248 2.0.\n\nthe same average degree (actually larger, which strengthens\nour conclusions). The homogeneous network does not experience cascading failures due either to random breakdown or\nto intentional attacks for \u03b1 as small as 0.05. For the heterogeneous (scale-free) network, for the same value of \u03b1, cascades\ntriggered by the attack on a key node can reduce the largest\nconnected component to less than 10% of the original size,\nas shown in the inset. Therefore, homogeneous networks appear to be more robust against attacks than the heterogeneous\nones. This conclusion does not rely on the particularities of\n1.0\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n0.6\n\nG\n0.4\n\n0.4\n0.2\n\n0.2\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n\u03b1\n\n0.3\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.8\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\nFIG. 2: Cascading failure in homogeneous networks. All nodes are\nset to have the same degree k = 3 and N = 5000. In the inset, the\nnetworks are generated according to the algebraic distribution (2) for\nk \u2265 2, \u03b3 = 3, and N = 5000. The resulting average degree is\nhki \u2248 3.1. The legends and other parameters are the same as in Fig.\n1.\n\n\f3\nthese models, as the same was also observed for classes of\nnetworks with exponential and Poisson-like distributions of\ndegrees (e.g., the Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi model [29]): their homogeneity makes them relatively resistant to cascades triggered by\nattacks. The networks corresponding to the inset of Fig. 2 are\ngenerated according to the same scaling distribution of those\nin Fig. 1, except that in this case the minimal number of links\nat a node is set to be 2. Therefore, this inset shows that the\nfragility of scale-free networks is due to their heterogeneity\nand does not rely on the presence of nodes with degree one,\nwhich are easily disconnectable. Naturally, the increase of the\naverage degree reduces the damage of the cascade, as can be\nseen from a comparison between Fig. 1 and the inset of Fig.\n2.\nMany real-world networks are heterogeneous and as such\nare expected to undergo large-scale cascades if some vital\nnodes are attacked, but rarely in the case of random breakdown. As an example we consider the Internet at autonomous\nsystem level [30], which displays an algebraic distribution of\nlinks [3]. The damage caused by triggers of higher load or degree is much larger than that by random breakdown, as shown\nin Fig. 3. The cascading failures are rarely triggered by random breakdown for \u03b1 > 0.05, but more than 20% of the nodes\ncan be disconnected with the intentional attack on only one\nnode for \u03b1 \u2264 0.4. We have also considered the electrical\npower grid of the western United States [31]. The degree distribution in this network is consistent with an exponential [32]\nand is thus relatively homogeneous. The distribution of loads,\nhowever, is more skewed than that displayed by semirandom\nnetworks [27, 28] with the same distribution of links, indicating that the power grid has structures that are not captured by\nthese models. As a result, global cascades can be triggered by\nload-based intentional attacks but not by random or degreebased removal of nodes, as shown in Fig. 4. We see that\nthe attack on a single node with large load reduces the largest\nconnected component to less than a half of its initial size, even\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n\nG\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n\u03b1\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\nFIG. 3: Cascading failure in the Internet at autonomous system level\n[30]. The network has N = 6474 nodes and hki \u2248 3.88 links\nper node, on average. Each curve corresponds to the average over 5\ntriggers for attacks and 50 for random breakdown.

The average is\nobtained via 5 triggers for attacks and 50 for random breakdown.\nThe legends are the same as in Fig. 1.\n\nwhen the network is highly tolerant (e.g., \u03b1 = 1).\nOur result is thus that real networks are naturally evolved\nto be quite resistant to random failure of nodes, but the presence of a few nodes with exceptionally large load, which is\nknown to be ubiquitous in natural and man-made networks,\nhas a disturbing side effect: the attack on a single important\nnode (one of those with high load) may trigger a cascade of\noverload failures capable of disabling the network almost entirely. Such an event has dramatic consequences on the network performance, because the functionability of a network\nrelies on the ability of the nodes to communicate efficiently\nwith each other. What is the use, say, of having a phone if you\ncannot call anybody?\nWe conclude with some thoughts on the meaning of our results for security. An effective attack relies on identifying vulnerabilities and is far from being random. Our society is geographically distributed in a way that natural hazards are by no\nmeans random [33]. An example is the crowding of people,\ncommunication, transportation, and financial centers around\nseismic areas, like the Pacific Rim. Natural disasters and intentional attacks can then have devastating consequences on\nthe complex networks underlying the society. These consequences will be more severe if the damage on one or few\nnodes is capable of spreading over the entire network. In\nthis sense a cascade-based attack can be much more destructive than any other strategies of attack previously considered\n[3, 7, 8, 9, 28, 34, 35, 36].\nThe authors thank R\u00e9ka Albert and Duncan J.

These authors focus on overloads caused by the\ngrowth of the network. Their model assigns the same capacity\nto every node in the network. In their analysis, when a node is\noverloaded, the links to that node are removed, but the node itself is not removed and can be reconnected in the future. Their\nconclusion is that, to avoid overloads, the capacity must grow\nwith the size of the network. Our model is different from the\nmodel in Ref. [23] as we assume the capacity to be node dependent and the failed nodes to be permanently removed from the\nnetwork. More importantly, we address the issues of intentional\nattack and random breakdown, and we study how the network\ncollapses under overload failures induced by them. We assume\nthat the time scale for these events is much smaller than the time\nscale in which the network grows.\n[25] S. Redner, Eur. Phys. J. B 4, 131 (1998).\n[26] M. Faloutsos, P.
