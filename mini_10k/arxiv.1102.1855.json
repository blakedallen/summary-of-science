The lepton pair mass distribution has been used for the diagnostics of QGP\nformation as well as to study the in-medium properties of low mass vector mesons [5\u20137]. The transverse\nmomentum (pT ) distribution of lepton pairs in various M ranges has been used to study the systems\nradial flow development [8]. The HBT interferometry using dilepton pairs has been proposed to provide\ninformation on the time development of collectivity\nin heavy-ion collisions [9].\nMeasurements at SPS (center of mass energy,\n\u221a\n\u221a\nsN N = 17.3 GeV) [10, 11] and RHIC ( sN N = 200\nGeV) [12] have provided results for e+ e\u2212 and \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212\nlepton pairs. Hence theoretical calculations have so\nfar also concentrated on e+ e\u2212 and \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 dilepton\nproduction. With the starting of the heavy-ion collision program at Large Hadron Collider (LHC) a\n\u221a\nvalue of sNN = 2.76 TeV has been achieved for\nPb + Pb collisions and and it is planned to reach\n\u221a\nsN N = 5.5 TeV shortly. At the LHC energies we\nexpect significant production of the third generation\nlepton, the \u03c4 -leptons. This opens up the possibility\nto study \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 pair production in addition to e+ e\u2212\n\nand \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 pairs at these energies. The major advantage of looking at \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 lepton pair arises due to\nthe mass of the \u03c4 (\u223c 1.77 GeV). The \u03c4 pair mass\ndistribution would then start beyond the low mass\nhadronic resonances (\u03c9, \u03c1 and \u03c6). That is \u03c1, \u03c9 and \u03c6\ncan not \"pollute\" (unlike e+ e\u2212 or \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) the \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212\ncontributions from QGP in this mass domain, making it easier to detect QGP through their measurement. The \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 pair production from the decays of\nheavy flavours is expected to be small in the mass\nregion around 4 GeV. This would in turn mean the\nremaining contribution for \u03c4 production are due to\nthermal partonic sources and the Drell Yan (DY).\nAlthough the yield of \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 will be lower compared\nto other lepton pairs, the yield at LHC should be\nsignificant enough to make their detection possible.\n\nIn this paper we present a case study of heavy lepton pair production\n\u221a for central Pb+Pb collisions at\nmid-rapidity for sN N = 5.5 TeV. In section II we\ndiscuss various processes for \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 production. Section III is dedicated for the space-time description\nof the evolving thermal medium formed in the collision. Results for thermal as well as DY production\nare presented in section IV. Finally we summarize\nour results on this case study in section V.\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nSOURCE OF \u03c4 DILEPTON PAIR\nPRODUCTION\n\nThe main processes for \u03c4 \u00b1 pair production is by\nquark and anti-quark annihilation via intermediary\nphoton, Z and Higgs bosons. The production of\n\u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 is significant for M \u223c MZ and M \u223c MH\nfor processes mediated by Z and Higgs bosons respectively, for lower M the contributions from these\nprocesses are negligible. The corresponding Feynman diagrams are shown in Fig. 1. They all contribute to thermal production of \u03c4 \u00b1 pair in quark\ngluon plasma, in principle as well as in the DY process.\nThe productions for these processes are evaluated\nfrom the matrix elements indicated below. The matrix element for the process q q\u0304 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 via Z is\ngiven by,\n\nby the parton distribution functions (PDF) as follows [14]\nZ\nd\u03c3 pp\n1 dx1\ndx2 X\n\u03c3q [q(x1 )q\u0304(x2 ) + (1 \u2194 2)]\n=\n2\ndM dy\nNc x1\nx2 q\n1 x1\n\u00d7\u03b4(y \u2212 ln )\n2 x2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c3q is the partonic cross section, q(xi ) (q\u0304(xi ))\nis the quark (anti-quark) distribution in nucleon, xi\nis the Bjorken scaling variable, y is the rapidity and\nNc is the number of colours. In the present work\nCTEQ5M PDF's [15] have been taken for the evaluation of the DY contributions.

The total production cross section (\u03c3q ) of \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 is obtained by taking a coherent sum of the matrix elements given in\nEqs. 1, 2 and 3 with the following values of various parameters: M\u03c4 = 1.78 GeV, mZ = 91 GeV,\nmH = 120 GeV, sin\u03b8w = 0.234, cqA = 0.5, cqV = 0.19,\nc\u03c4A = \u22120.5 and c\u03c4V = \u22120.03.\nThe production of DY pair from pp collision is\nobtained by folding the partonic cross section (\u03c3q )\n\nwhere fq (fq\u0304 ) is the thermal distribution for the\nquark (anti-quark), vqq\u0304 is the relative velocity between the quark and anti-quark.

We assume that the system reaches\nequilibration at a proper time \u03c4i = 0.08 fm/c after\nthe collision. The initial temperature, Ti is taken to\nbe 700 MeV and is calculated assuming the hadronic\nmultiplicity (dN/dy)\u223c 2100 [21]. We use the equation of state (EoS) obtained from the lattice QCD\ncalculations by the MILC collaboration [22] for the\npartonic phase. For the hadronic phase EoS all\nthe resonances up to mass 2.5 GeV have been considered [23]. The crossover temperature (Tc ) between hadronic and partonic phase is taken to be\n175 MeV [24].\n\nIV.\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10 12 14 16 18 20\n\nM GeV\nFIG. 2: (a) \u03c4 lepton pair yields as a function of invariant mass of the pair is displayed for Pb+Pb collisions at\n\u221a\nsNN = 5.5 TeV.

The contributions from Drell Yan (DY, dashed line) and thermal\npartonic medium (QGP, solid line) are shown. The\nDrell Yan contribution is higher than the thermal\ncontribution for all the mass range studied. The difference seems to increase with increase in \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 pair\nmass.\n\nFigure 2(b) shows the ratio\ndN P bP b\ndMdy\n\ndN P bP b\ndMdy\n\npp\n\ndN\n/ [Ncoll dMdy\n].\n\nis the sum of the contributions shown in\nFigure 2(a) from Pb+Pb collisions. The quantity\ndN pp\n[Ncoll dMdy\n] is the number of binary collisions scaled\ncontribution from DY process obtained using Eq. 5.\nThis contribution can be estimated from the mea\u221a\nsurement in p+p collisions at the same energy ( s\n= 5.5 TeV). We observe that the ratio is above unity\n\n\f4\nfor the mass range of 4 to 6 GeV. Starting with a\nvalue \u223c 2 at mass of 4 GeV it decreases toward\nunity beyond mass of 6 GeV. This indicates that\none should be able to extract a clear information of\nthermal contribution from partonic source at LHC\nenergies using heavy lepton pair measurement within\nthe mass window of 4 to 6 GeV. It is interesting to\nnote that the ratio plotted in Fig. 2 for the heaviest\npairs (\u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 ) is very similar to that for the lightest\nlepton pairs (e+ e\u2212 ).\nIn this first such case study, we have not discussed\nthe transverse momentum distribution of \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 pair,\nthese studies are planned to be presented subsequently. Moreover, we do not discuss the experimental scenario for the measurements of \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 spectra estimated here for heavy ion collisions at the\nhighest LHC energy. For more details we refer to\n[25]. The \u03c4 particle is the only lepton heavy enough\nto decay into hadrons. \u03c4 leptons are considered to\nbe a signature in several discovery channels related\nto the Standard Model Higgs boson at low masses,\nthe MSSM Higgs boson or Super-symmetry (SUSY).\nHence experimental plans exist at LHC to reconstruct them in one-prong (one charged pion) and\nthree-prong (three charged pions) decay topologies.\nThe lifetime of the \u03c4 lepton (c\u03c4 = 87.11\u03bcm) in principle allows for the reconstruction of its decay vertex\nin the case of three-prong decays. The flight path in\nthe detector increases with the Lorentz boost of the\n\u03c4 lepton, but at the same time the angular separation of the decay products decreases. A resulting\ntransverse impact parameter of the \u03c4 decay products\ncan be used to distinguish them from objects originating from the production vertex. In fact experiments at LHC claim the overall efficiency for reconstructing good quality tracks from \u03c4 lepton hadronic\ndecays is of the order of 82% [25]. Further the excel-\n\nlent knowledge of \u03c4 decay modes and detection from\nlow energy experiments [26] makes the heavy lepton\npair production measurements feasible at LHC.\n\n[1] L. D.

The LHC energy is a\nfactor 27 more compared to RHIC, this should allow\nfor significant production of \u03c4 leptons for LHC energies. The main sources for \u03c4 pair production is by\nquark and anti-quark annihilation mediated through\nphoton, Z and Higgs bosons. The contribution from\ngluon fusion process via virtual quark loop and intermediate Z and Higgs boson is negligibly small in the\nmass range of our calculations (4 to 20 GeV). The\nDrell Yan contribution is found to be higher than the\nthermal contribution from partonic sources for the\nentire mass range studied. The non-thermal contributions could be measured experimentally through\np+p collisions, then the ratio of yields from nucleusnucleus collisions to the yields for the binary collision\nscaled p+p collisions is found to be above unity for\nthe mass range of 4-6 GeV. This indicates that the\ninvariant mass window for the observation of thermal \u03c4 leptons at LHC energy lies in the domain 4-6\nGeV.\nAcknowledgments\nBM is supported by DAE-BRNS project Sanction No. 2010/21/15-BRNS/2026.
