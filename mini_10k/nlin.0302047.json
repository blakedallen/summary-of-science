Semiclassical periodic-orbit theory and closed-orbit theory represent a quantum spectrum as a\nsuperposition of contributions from individual classical orbits.

Semiclassically, the response function\nsplits into a smooth part and an oscillatory part of the\nform\nX\ng osc (E) =\nAc.o. (E) eiSc.o. (E)/~ ,\n(2)\nc.o.\n\nwhere the sum extends over all classical closed orbits starting from the nucleus and returning to it after having been\ndeflected by the external fields. Sc.o. is the classical action\nof the closed orbit. The precise form of the recurrence amplitude Ac.o. depends on the geometry of the external field\nconfiguration, but it can in any case be calculated from\nclassical properties of the closed orbit. Periodic-orbit theory, which can be applied to any quantum system possessing a classical counterpart, represents the quantum den-\n\nsity of states as a sum over the classical periodic orbits in\ncomplete analogy with (2).\nBoth variants of the semiclassical theory share the\nproblem that the semiclassical amplitudes Ac.o. diverge\nwhen the corresponding classical orbits undergo a bifurcation. This failure occurs because close to a bifurcation\nthe classical orbits cannot be regarded as isolated in phase\nspace, as the simple semiclassical expansion (2) assumes.\nIt can be remedied if the individual contributions of the\nbifurcating orbits to the closed-orbit sum (2) are replaced\nwith a uniform approximation that describes their collective contribution [5,6,7,8]. For the generic codimensionone bifurcations of periodic orbits [6,7,8] as well as closed\norbits [9,10], uniform approximations are available in the\nliterature. Typically, bifurcations of higher codimensions\nare not encountered classically because they split into sequences of codimension-one bifurcations upon an arbitrarily small perturbation. Semiclassically, however, these sequences must be described collectively by a single uniform approximation if the individual bifurcations are sufficiently close [11,12,13,14]. It can thus be necessary in\npractice to construct uniform approximations for bifurcation scenarios that are much more complicated than the\nelementary bifurcations of codimension one.\nThe crucial step in the derivation of a uniform approximation [8,9,10,11] is the choice of a normal form \u03a6a (x) describing the bifurcation scenario. Its stationary points, i.e.\nthe solutions of \u2202\u03a6a (x)/\u2202x = 0, must be in one-to-one cor-\n\n\f2\n\nThomas Bartsch et al.: Uniform semiclassical approximations on a topologically non-trivial configuration space\n\nrespondence with the classical closed orbits. In addition,\nas the parameter a is varied, the stationary points must\ncollide and change from real to complex in accordance\nwith the closed-orbit bifurcations. Once a suitable normal\nform is known, the uniform approximation assumes the\nform\n\u03a8 (E) = I(a) eiS0 (E)/~ ,\n(3)\nwhere\nI(a) =\n\nZ\n\ndx p(x) ei\u03a6a (x)\n\n(4)\n\nand the normal form parameter a, the action S0 and the\nunknown function p(x) are determined as functions of the\nenergy E such that the uniform approximation asymptotically reproduces the closed-orbit formula (2) for isolated\norbits if the distance from the bifurcation is large.\nUsually, the choices of a and S0 are unique. By contrast, the asymptotic condition fixes the values of the amplitude function p(x) only at the stationary points of \u03a6a ,\nso that there remains considerable freedom in its choice.\nCustomarily, a low-order polynomial that interpolates between the given values is chosen. This decision can be\njustified by observing that a uniform approximation is\nneeded only in the vicinity of the bifurcation, where the\nstationary points of the normal form are close. Since, in\nthe spirit of the stationary-phase approximation, only the\nneighbourhood of the stationary points of \u03a6a contributes\nto the integral (4), a Taylor series approximation that is\naccurate in that region can be expected to be appropriate.\nSo far, the configuration space of a uniform approximation, i.e. the domain of the normal form variable x and\nthe range of the integral (4) could always be chosen to be\na one- or multidimensional Euclidean space. In this paper,\nwe describe an example where this is impossible because\nfor topological reasons the bifurcating orbits cannot be\nrepresented as stationary points of a function defined on\na Euclidean space. This result is surprising because uniform approximations, as well as the underlying normal\nforms, are needed to describe closely spaced orbits and bifurcations, and in this sense are local constructions. The\ntopology of the configuration space, on the other hand, reflects its global characteristics. The necessity to base a uniform approximation on a configuration space of a suitable\ntopology thus involves a subtle interplay between local\nand global aspects of the classical phase space structure.\nWe demonstrate that the established techniques for the\nconstruction of uniform approximations are, in principle,\napplicable to uniform approximations on a topologically\nnon-trivial configuration space, but that additional complications arise when non-local aspects of the dynamics\nhave to be dealt with.\nThe bifurcation scenario to be discussed arises, e.g.,\nin the hydrogen atom in an electric field. This is an integrable system, and photo-absorption spectra can in principle be obtained by the quantization of classical tori [15,\n16]. However, while the torus quantization is restricted to\nintegrable systems, closed-orbit theory is intended to be\napplicable to arbitrary atomic systems exhibiting either\nregular, chaotic, or mixed classical behaviour. Therefore,\nit is of vital interest to see how it can be applied to this\n\napparently simple example. It turns out that to a closedorbit theory approach the hydrogen atom in an electric\nfield poses the same difficulties in principle as a generic\nmixed system because the closed orbits undergo plenty of\nbifurcations. We thus start with a description of the closed\norbits in that system in section 2. In section 3 we focus on\nthe bifurcations at low energies and show that in this spectral region a uniform approximation is required that goes\nbeyond the known uniform approximation for the Stark\nsystem [17,18,19,20,21]. This uniform approximation is\nconstructed in section 4, where we also demonstrate that\nit must rely on a sphere instead of a Euclidean plane as\nits configuration space. It is compared with the previous\nuniform approximation, and in section 5 its merits are assessed by the calculation of semiclassical photo-absorption\nspectra.\n\n2 Closed orbits\nThe bifurcations of closed orbits in the hydrogen atom in\nan electric field follow a simple scheme that was described\nby Gao and Delos [22]. Complementary to that work, we\ndemonstrated in a recent publication [21] that to a large\nextent the closed orbits and their parameters can be computed analytically. We will now summarize the essential\nfeatures of the bifurcation scenario. For details, the reader\nis referred to [21].\nIf we assume the electric field F to be directed along\nthe z-axis, the Hamiltonian describing the motion of the\natomic electron reads, in atomic units,\nH=\n\n1 2 1\np \u2212 + Fz ,\n2\nr\n\n(5)\n\nwhere r2 = x2 + y 2 + z 2 . It can be simplified by means of\nits scaling properties: If the coordinates and momenta are\nscaled according to x\u0303 = F 1/2 x, p\u0303 = F \u22121/4 p, the classical\ndynamics is found not to depend on the energy E and the\nelectric field strength F separately, but only on the scaled\nenergy \u1ebc = F \u22121/2 E.\nThe qualitative simplicity of the bifurcation scenario\nis due to the well-known fact [23,24] that the Hamiltonian (5) is separable in semiparabolic coordinates \u03c11 , \u03c12 ,\n\u03c6, where\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03c12 = r\u0303 + z\u0303 ,\n(6)\n\u03c11 = r\u0303 \u2212 z\u0303 ,\nand \u03c6 is the azimuth angle around the electric field axis.\nThe angular coordinate \u03c6 is ignorable, so that its conjugate momentum, the angular momentum Lz around the\nfield axis, is conserved. For closed orbits, which pass through\nthe nucleus, Lz = 0. The dynamics of \u03c11 and \u03c12 is then\ngiven by the equations of motion\n\u03c1\u20322\n1 =\n\u03c1\u20322\n2\n\n\u03c141 + 2E\u03c121 + c1 ,\n\n= \u2212\u03c142 + 2E\u03c122 + c2 ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere E is the energy and the separation constants c1 and\nc2 describe the distribution of energy between the \u03c11 and\n\u03c12 degrees of freedom. They are restricted by\nc1 + c2 = 4 .\n\n(8)\n\n\fThomas Bartsch et al.: Uniform semiclassical approximations on a topologically non-trivial configuration space\n\nFor real orbits the separation constants are constrained to\nthe interval\n0 \u2264 cj \u2264 4 .\n(9)\n\nIf they fail to meet (9), either \u03c11 or \u03c12 assumes complex\nvalues, so that a closed \"ghost\" orbit in the complexified\nphase space is obtained.\nIn the simplest cases, one of the \u03c1j vanishes identically.\nThe electron then moves along the electric field axis. If\nc1 = 0, the downhill coordinate \u03c11 is zero. The electron\nleaves the nucleus in the uphill direction, i.e. in the direction of the electric field, until it is turned around by\nthe joint action of the Coulomb and external fields and\nreturns to the nucleus. After the first return, the uphill\norbit is repeated periodically. As the external field provides an arbitrarily high deflecting potential, the uphill\norbit is closed at all energies.\nThe second case of axial motion is obtained if c1 =\n4, which corresponds to \u03c12 \u2261 0 and thus to a downhill\nmotion opposite to the direction of the electric field. The\ndownhill orbit closes only if the scaled energy \u1ebc is less than\nthe scaled saddle point energy \u1ebcS = \u22122. If \u1ebc > \u1ebcS , the\nelectron escapes to infinity and the orbit does not close. At\nscaled energies \u1ebc < \u1ebcS , the downhill orbit, as the uphill\norbit, is repeated periodically.\nIn general, the motion of the electron will not be directed along the electric field axis and will consist of a\nsuperposition of the downhill and uphill motions. In this\ncase a closed orbit is obtained if the downhill and uphill\nmotions close at the same time after k oscillations in the\ndownhill direction and l oscillations in the uphill direction.\nA closed orbit characterized by integer repetition number\n(k, l) must satisfy [21]\nk\u03c1\u2212 K(m1 ) = l\u03c1+ K(m2 )\nwith\n\u03c1+ =\n\u03c1\u2212 =\n\nr\n\nq\n\u2212\u1ebc + \u1ebc 2 \u2212 c1 ,\nr\nq\n\u2212\u1ebc +\n\n\u1ebc 2\n\n+ c2 ,\n\nm1 = +\n\n(10)\n\nc1\n,\n\u03c14+\n\n(11)\n\nc2\nm2 = \u2212 4\n\u03c1\u2212\n\nand K(m) denoting the complete elliptic integral of the\nfirst kind [25].\nFor given repetition numbers k, l and scaled energy\n\u1ebc, if we use that c2 = 4 \u2212 c1 by (8), equation (10) can\nbe solved for the separation parameter c1 that specifies\nthe initial conditions of the orbit. A solution only exists\nif l > k. Once c1 is known, all orbital parameters relevant to closed-orbit theory can be found analytically. In\nparticular, the classical action of the closed orbit is [21]\nS=\n\n2\n2 3\nk\u03c1+ I(m1 ) \u2212 l\u03c13\u2212 I(m2 )\n3\n3\n\n(12)\n\nwith\nI(m) = (m \u2212 1)K(m) + (m + 1)E(m)\n\n(13)\n\nand the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second\nkinds K(m) and E(m) [25]. It is real for both real and\nghost orbits.\n\n3\n\nIf the repetition numbers k and l are fixed, for sufficiently low scaled energies \u1ebc the value of the separation\nconstant c1 obtained from (10) is greater than 4, so that\nthe (k, l)-orbit is a ghost. As \u1ebc increases, c1 decreases\nmonotonically. At the energy \u1ebcdest where c1 = 4, the\n(k, l)-orbit becomes real. It is generated (as a real orbit)\nin a bifurcation off the k-th repetition of the downhill orbit, which is characterized by c1 = 4. As \u1ebc is further\nincreased, the orbit moves away from the downhill orbit\nand approaches the uphill orbit. At the energy \u1ebcdest where\nc1 = 0, the orbit (k, l) collides with the l-th repetition of\nthe uphill orbit and is destroyed. At \u1ebc > \u1ebcdest the orbit\nis a ghost again.\nThe bifurcation energies \u1ebcgen and \u1ebcdest can be determined from (10) if c1 = 4 is prescribed for the generation\nof an orbit, or c1 = 0 for its destruction.

Uniform semiclassical\napproximations describing this type of bifurcation have\nbeen derived by several authors [17,18,19,21]. However,\nthey are only applicable if the individual bifurcations are\nsufficiently isolated. If they are close, more complicated\nuniform approximations that provide a collective description of several bifurcations must be found. Thus, there are\ntwo spectral regions where the construction of uniform approximations poses a particular challenge:\nFirst, as the Stark saddle energy \u1ebcS = \u22122 is approached from below, the downhill orbit undergoes infinitely many bifurcations in a finite energy interval before\nit is destroyed. The periods of the closed orbits created in\nthis way, as the period of the downhill orbit itself, grow arbitrarily large. The actions, however, remain finite, so that\nthe action differences between the orbits stemming from\ntwo successive bifurcations become arbitrarily small. Similar cascades of isochronous bifurcations have been found,\ne.g., in the diamagnetic Kepler problem [26] and in H\u00e9nonHeiles type potentials [27]. Their uniformization remains\nan open problem. A detailed discussion of this cascade in\nthe Stark system must be referred to future work.\n\n\f4\n\nThomas Bartsch et al.: Uniform semiclassical approximations on a topologically non-trivial configuration space\n\n14\n12\n\n8\n~\nS\n\nT\n\n~\n\n10\n\n~\n\u2206Scrit\n\n6\n4\n2\n0\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n~\n\n~\n\nEgen\n\nE\n\nFig. 1.

Dashed\nlines\np\n\u22122\nindicate first, second and third multiples of T\u0303 = 2\u03c0\n\u1ebc.\n3\n\nSecond, non-axial orbits with winding ratios z = l/k\nclose to one are created and destroyed at low energies,\nand their generation and destruction are closely spaced\n(see figure 1). Therefore, at low energies a uniform approximation describing both the creation of a non-axial\norbit from the downhill orbit and its destruction at the\nuphill orbit is required. It will be derived in section 4. As\na prerequisite, to quantitatively assess its necessity, the\nasymptotic behaviour of closed-orbit bifurcations at low\nenergies will be investigated in detail in this section.\nBifurcation energies can be determined from equations\n(14) and (15). As a winding ratio z = l/k close to one\ncorresponds to low bifurcation energies and small values\nof the parameter \u01eb = (\u1ebcS /\u1ebc)2 , approximate bifurcation\nenergies can be obtained by expanding the right hand sides\nof (14) and (15) in a Taylor series around \u01eb = 0.

From the coefficients of the quadratic terms in (33) and (34) it is apparent that a ring of stationary points bifurcates off \u03b8 = 0 at\na = 1, and off \u03b8 = \u03c0 at a = \u22121.\nThese conclusions are confirmed by a discussion of the\nfull normal form (32). The ring of stationary points is\nlocated at the polar angle \u03b8non satisfying\ncos \u03b8non = a .\n\n(35)\n\nThis angle qualitatively corresponds to the starting and\nreturning angle of the non-axial orbit in that it describes\nits motion from the downhill orbit at \u03b8 = 0 to the uphill\norbit at \u03b8 = \u03c0. Quantitatively, \u03b8non cannot directly be\nidentified with the classical angle \u03b8 because the energydependence of the normal form parameters a and b is fixed\nby matching the action differences rather than the angles.\nIf \u22121 \u2264 a \u2264 1, the angle \u03b8non defined by (35) is real.

As the normal form parameters\nare varied, the ring must branch off the first isolated stationary point and later contract onto the second. This is\nimpossible if the normal form is to be defined in a plane,\nbut it is easily achieved if the normal form is based on\na sphere.

Due to the rotational symmetry, the latter is well defined even at the\npoles.\nFigure 4 should be compared to figure 5, which displays the orbital data pertinent to an actual bifurcation\nscenario. The qualitative agreement between figure 4 and\nfigure 5 is obvious, so that (32) can be seen to describe the\nbifurcations correctly.

This somewhat atypical behaviour can\nbe traced back to the fact that the domain of integration\nin this case is compact.\nAs an example, figure 6 compares the uniform approximation (49) for the orbit (20,21) and three different electric field strengths to the isolated-orbits approximation\nand to the uniform approximation (28) for isolated bifurcations. For the latter, the non-axial orbit and the axial\n\n\f8\n\nThomas Bartsch et al.: Uniform semiclassical approximations on a topologically non-trivial configuration space\n\nroughly equal pace on both sides of the bifurcations. Between the bifurcations, the isolated-bifurcations approximation now clearly attains its asymptotic behaviour, whereas the uniform approximation on the sphere exhibits qualitatively similar behaviour, but differs significantly from\nthe other two in quantitative terms. It requires the even\nlower field strength of F = 10\u221210 used in figure 6(c) until both uniform approximations agree with the isolatedorbits result in the region between the bifurcations.\nThe uniform approximation on the sphere was constructed because in the energy region between the bifurcations the isolated-bifurcations approximation must fail\nfor low energies and high field strengths. However, it turns\nout to reach its asymptotic agreement with the isolatedorbits results considerably more slowly than the isolatedbifurcations approximation. In cases where the latter reproduces the isolated-orbits results between the bifurcations, of course, no further uniformization is required.\n\n35\n(a)\n\n30\n\n~\n\n|\u03a8(E)|\n\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n(b)\n\n3\n\n2\n\n~\n\n|\u03a8(E)|\n\n2.5\n\n1.5\n1\n\n5 Semiclassical Stark spectra\n\n0.5\n0\n1.4\n\n(c)\n\n1.2\n\n~\n\n|\u03a8(E)|\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-5\n\n-4.8\n\n-4.6\n\n-4.4\n\n-4.2\n\n-4\n\n-3.8\n\n-3.6\n\n-3.4\n\n-3.2\n\n~\n\nE\n\nFig. 6.

Between the two bifurcations,\nthe isolated-bifurcations approximation appears just to arrive at its asymptotic behaviour before the second bifurcation is felt. The behaviour of the uniform approximation\non the sphere is completely different there.\nIf the field strength is decreased, both uniform approximations reach their asymptotic regions faster. For F =\n10\u22126 , they approach the isolated-orbits approximation at\n\nMore information on the virtue of the uniform approximation on the sphere can be obtained from a calculation\nof actual semiclassical spectra. To this end we calculated\nsemiclassical photo-absorption spectra for the hydrogen\natom in an electric field based on closed-orbit theory and\nincluding uniform approximations. To low-resolution, a\nsemiclassical spectrum can be obtained if the contributions of orbits up to a maximum period Temax are included\nin the closed-orbit sum (2).\nWe will present results for the photoexcitation of the\n1s ground state of the hydrogen atom in an electric field of\nstrength F = 10\u22128 a.u.=51.4\n\u02c6\nV/cm. The exciting photon\nis assumed to be linearly polarized along the field axis.\nIn the closed-orbit summation, the uniform approximation (49) based on the sphere will be used if the action\ndifferences between a non-axial orbit and both the downhill and uphill orbits it bifurcates out of are smaller than\n2\u03c0. In the other cases, we revert to the simple uniform\napproximation (28) or the isolated-orbits approximation,\nas appropriate.\nFigure 7 shows a comparison between the semiclassical\nspectra obtained from the simple uniform approximation\nonly (figure 7(a)), the closed-orbit summation with the\nuniform approximation based on the sphere (figure 7(b)),\nand an appropriately smoothed quantum spectrum (figure 7(c)). Note that only the oscillatory part of the semiclassical spectra is plotted, so that the base line is slightly\nshifted away from zero. This shift is absent in the quantum\nspectrum.\nIt has already been found in [21] that, if only the simple uniform approximation (3) is used, the spectral lines\nclose to the centres of the n-manifolds tend to have considerable strengths although they are negligibly weak in\nthe quantum spectrum. If the uniform approximation on\nthe sphere is used, on the one hand the line strengths\ndevelop a second maximum at the centre of a manifold.\nOn the other hand, however, the absolute intensity of the\n\n\fThomas Bartsch et al.: Uniform semiclassical approximations on a topologically non-trivial configuration space\n160\n\n160\n(a)\n\n120\n\n100\n\n100\n\n80\n\n(E)\n\n80\n\n40\n\n-Im g\n\n40\n\n60\n\nosc\n\nosc\n\n120\n(E)\n\n140\n\n-Im g\n\n140\n\n20\n\n20\n0\n\n-20\n\n-20\n\n-40\n\n-40\n\n160\n\n160\n(b)\n\n100\n\n100\n\n(E)\n\n80\n\n(E)\n\n80\n\n40\n\n-Im g\n\n40\n\n60\n\nosc\n\nosc\n\n120\n\n-Im g\n\n140\n\n120\n\n20\n-20\n\n-20\n\n-40\n\n-40\n160\n(c)\n\n140\n\n120\n\n120\n\n100\n\n100\n\n80\n\n80\n\n-Im g(E)\n\n-Im g(E)\n\n20\n0\n\n160\n\n(b)\n\n60\n\n0\n\n140\n\n(a)\n\n60\n\n0\n\n140\n\n9\n\n60\n40\n20\n\n60\n40\n20\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-20\n\n-20\n\n-40\n\n-40\n\n-60\n-9.6 -9.4 -9.2\n\n(c)\n\n-60\n-9\n\n-8.8 -8.6 -8.4 -8.2\n\n-8\n\n-7.8\n\n4\n\n10 E\n\nFig. 7.

The line shapes are slightly asymmetric, although the asymmetry is weaker than at higher\nenergies [21]. In the spectrum obtained using the uniform approximation on the sphere (figure 8(b)), the strong\nouter lines of the manifold are virtually identical to those\nin the previous spectrum, but the central lines are distorted. On the other hand, again, as the central lines are\nweaker in the spectrum of figure 8(b) than in figure 8(a),\nthe distribution of intensities within the manifold is described more accurately if the uniform approximation on\nthe sphere is used.\n\n\f10\n\nThomas Bartsch et al.: Uniform semiclassical approximations on a topologically non-trivial configuration space\n\nIn addition to the calculation of low-resolution semiclassical spectra, we can use the techniques of [20,21] to\ncompute individual spectral lines. The results do not depend strongly on the choice of the uniform approximations; the high-resolution spectra obtained from the spectrum in figure 7(b) which use the uniform approximation\non the sphere (see [9]) are virtually identical to those presented in [21] that apply the simple uniform approximation (figure 7(a)) only.\nThe uniform approximation on the sphere, although\nit satisfies the correct asymptotic conditions and is well\nadapted to the bifurcation scenario qualitatively, in quantitative terms does not yield absolutely precise results.\nThe problem is probably connected to the non-trivial spherical topology of the configuration space of the uniform approximation: The construction of uniform approximations\nof the type (3) relies on the assumption that the unknown\nphase function in the diffraction integral can be mapped\nto a certain standard form by a suitable coordinate transformation. The fundamental theorems of catastrophe theory [28,29] guarantee that this is possible locally. In a\nCartesian configuration space and close to a bifurcation,\nall stationary points of the normal form are close to the\norigin, so that coordinate regions away from the origin\ncan, in the spirit of the stationary-phase approximation,\nbe assumed not to contribute to the diffraction integral.\nA local mapping of the function in the exponent to the\nnormal form and a local approximation to the amplitude\nfunction by means of a Taylor series thus suffice to obtain good results. By contrast, on the spherical configuration space a global approximation to the unknown functions must be sought because the stationary points are\ndistributed across the sphere: There is a stationary point\nat each pole. In the case at hand, we tried replacing the\n(cos \u03b8\u2212a)2 -term in the amplitude function (47) with sin \u03b8,\nwhich also gives a rough approximation to the actual amplitude function. The alteration has no significant effect\non the result. The construction of a quantitatively more\nreliable uniform approximation will presumably require\na deeper global understanding of the bifurcation scenarios. It remains a worthwhile challenge for future research\nto devise an easy-to-apply technique for the construction\nof uniform approximations that takes full account of the\nclassical phase space topology.\n\n6 Conclusion\nWe have discussed the bifurcations of closed orbits in the\nhydrogen atom in an electric field. At low scaled energies\na uniform semiclassical approximation is required that simultaneously describes both the generation and the destruction of a non-axial orbit. Its construction was carried\nout. Beyond its significance to the Stark system, it is of\ninterest for reasons of principle because it uses a sphere\ninstead of a Euclidean plane as its configuration space and\nthus is the first uniform approximation introduced in the\nliterature that relies on a topologically non-trivial configuration space. It could be demonstrated that uniform\napproximations with a non-Euclidean configuration space\n\ncan indeed be constructed and allow for the semiclassical calculation of significantly improved photo-absorption\nspectra of the hydrogen atom in an electric field.\n\nReferences\n1.
