This implies, in particular,\nthat static black holes cannot possess dipole hair under these fields.\nPACS numbers:\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIt has been known for several years that the properties of higher-dimensional black holes can differ significantly from the rigidly constrained character of fourdimensional black holes [1]. References. [2, 3] trace the\norigin of the new physics back to the possibility of having two parametrically different length scales along the\nhorizon, which allows higher-dimensional black holes to\nexhibit black brane-like behavior that cannot occur in\nfour dimensions. Typically, one of the scales is associated to the black hole mass and the other to its angular\nmomentum, which in five or more dimensions can be arbitrarily large for a given mass. As the two scales begin\nto separate, new phenomena set in, such as black hole\nnonuniqueness and horizon instabilities.\nThis observation suggests that the distinctively higherdimensional features of black holes arise only at sufficiently large rotation. In particular, it leads us to expect\nthat the properties of static black holes should be qualitatively very similar to those of four-dimensional black\nholes. There is already good evidence for this. Prompted\nby the discovery of black rings and the nonuniqueness of\nstationary black holes that they entail [4], Ref. [5] showed\nthat asymptotically flat, static vacuum black holes are\ninstead unique: the only solution is the SchwarzschildTangherlini spacetime. Afterward it was also shown that\nthis solution is dynamically stable to linearized perturbations [6]. While we expect that uniqueness (for solutions\nwith connected horizons) and stability are valid in a finite range of values of the angular momenta, the precise\nupper limits are still unknown in general (see [7, 8] for\nsome recent progress in this direction).\nIt is clearly of interest to study how these results are\nextended when gauge fields are present. A charge on\nthe black hole introduces an independent length scale,\nnamely the charge radius. A separation of scales occurs\nas extremality is approached, but this occurs in directions\ntransverse to the horizon instead of parallel to it, and is\nin fact an effect well-known in four dimensions too. So,\nagain, the onset of qualitatively new higher-dimensional\n\nfeatures seems to require a minimum amount of rotation.\nIn this direction, Ref. [9] has proven the uniqueness of\nthe n-dimensional static black holes electrically charged\nunder a two-form field strength, and Ref. [10] has studied\ntheir stability.\nA more distinctive property of gauge fields in higher\ndimensions is the possibility that a black hole couples\nelectrically to p-form field strengths H(p) with p > 2.\nAn asymptotically flat black hole in n dimensions cannot\nhave a conserved monopolar electric charge under this\nfield. One might expect that the integral of \u2217H(p) over a\nsphere S n\u2212p near asymptotically flat infinity gives a conserved charge. However, this is not the case when p > 2,\nsince the S n\u2212p can be shrunk to a point in the S n\u22122\nin the asymptotically flat region and the integral vanishes. Nevertheless, the black hole can be the source of\nan electric dipole of this field. Indeed, Ref. [11] presented\nrotating black ring solutions with dipoles of a three-form\nfield strength in five dimensions. Since the dipole is not\na conserved charge, it is hair for the black hole. The\ngeneric existence of rotating black holes with dipoles of\nfields H(p) with p \u2265 3 in dimensions n \u2265 p + 2 is argued\nin [12].\nCould a static black hole sport such dipole hairs? Intuitively, the dipole field can be regarded as sourced by a\n(p\u22122)-brane-like object extended along a compact (p\u22122)cycle. This \"brane\" exerts a tension that, if the cycle is\ncontractible, must be balanced by centrifugal rotation\n(this is indeed explicitly observed in the dipole rings of\n[11]). So this heuristic reasoning indicates that we should\nnot expect a black hole to be able to support a dipole until it carries a sufficiently large angular momentum.\nIn this article we prove the impossibility of dipole hair\nfor static black holes. The proof follows the one employed in the uniqueness theorem of higher-dimensional\nstatic black holes [5, 9, 13, 14]. This type of proof was\nfirst developed by Bunting and Masood-ul-Alam in four\ndimensions [15]. Its extension to higher dimensions is\nquite nontrivial, since [15] used properties specific to four\ndimensions, but the approach was extended in [5, 13] in\na manner that avoids the use of such properties.\n\n\f2\nTogether with the gauge dipole, we will also consider\nthe inclusion of scalar fields and scalar hair. Bekenstein\nproved that a static black hole can not have scalar hair\nin four dimensions [16]. This no-hair theorem is easily\nextended to higher dimensions since the dimensionality\ndoes not enter into the proof. However, this type of proof\ncannot be applied to systems where the scalar field couples to higher form fields.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II,\nwe prove the no-dipole-hair theorem in two steps: first we\nshow that a static black hole cannot support nontrivial pform fields when (n+1)/2 \u2264 p \u2264 n\u22121, and then we prove\nthe uniqueness of the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini solution.\nIn Sec. III, we discuss the outlook of this work, and in\nparticular the restriction on the values of p to which the\ntheorem applies.\nII.\n\nNO-DIPOLE-HAIR THEOREM\n\nWe consider n-dimensional asymptotically flat solutions of theories described by the class of Lagrangians\n1\n1\n2\n,\nL = R \u2212 (\u2202\u03c6)2 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b1\u03c6 H(p)\n2\np!\n\n(1)\n\nwhere R is the n-dimensional Ricci scalar, \u03c6 is a dilaton\nwith coupling \u03b1, and H(p) is the field strength of a (p\u22121)form field potential B(p\u22121) ,\nH(p) = dB(p\u22121) .\n\n(2)\n\nSince we are interested in asymptotically flat spacetimes,\nwe take p \u2264 n \u2212 1. A form field with p = n does not\nhave any dynamical degree of freedom and behaves like a\ncosmological constant, which would prevent asymptotic\nflatness.\nWe only consider electric fields of H(p) . Note that via\nelectric-magnetic duality we can always trade a magnetic\ncharge or dipole under H(p) for an electric one under\nH(n\u2212p) 1 . However, we do not consider the possibility of\nsimultaneous presence of dipoles and monopole charges\nof electric and magnetic type, e.g., in n = p + 2 one can\nhave solutions with both magnetic monopole charge and\nelectric dipole of H(p) . Sometimes these involve an additional Chern-Simons term in the action, which however\nis inconsequential for our analysis involving only electric\nfields. The uniqueness of U (1)2 -symmetric black holes in\nsome such theories in five dimensions has been discussed\nin [18].\nThe equations of motion for the theories (1) are\n\u22072 \u03c6 = \u2212\n\n\u03b1 \u2212\u03b1\u03c6 2\ne\nH(p)\np!\n\n(3)\n\n\u2207M (e\u2212\u03b1\u03c6 H MN1 ***Np\u22121 ) = 0\n\n(4)\n\nand\n\u0010\n1\n1\nI ***I\n\u2207M \u03c6\u2207N \u03c6 + e\u2212\u03b1\u03c6 pHM 1 p\u22121 HN I1 ***Ip\u22121\n2\np!\n\u0011\np\u22121\n2\n\u2212\n(5)\ngMN H(p) ,\nn\u22122\n\nRMN =\n\nwhere \u2207M is the covariant derivative with respect to\ngMN , and M, N = 0, . . . n \u2212 1.\nThe metric of a static spacetime can be written as\nds2 = gMN dxM dxN = \u2212V 2 (xi )dt2 + gij (xk )dxi dxj , (6)\nwhere xi are spatial coordinates on x0 = t =const. surfaces \u03a3.

On \u03a3\u0303\u2212 , the\nmetric behaves like\n(m/2)4/(n\u22123)\n\u03b4ij dxi dxj + O(1/r5 )\nr4\n= (m/2)4/(n\u22123) (d\u03c12 + \u03c12 d\u03a92n\u22122 ) + O(\u03c15 ),\n(25)\n\n\u2212\ng\u0303ij\ndxi dxj =\n\nwhere we set \u03c1 := 1/r. From this, we see that infinity on\n\u03a3 corresponds to a point, which we denote as q.\n+\nLet us construct a new manifold (\u03a3\u0303, g\u0303ij ) := (\u03a3\u0303+ , g\u0303ij\n)\u222a\n\u2212 \u2212\n+ +\n(\u03a3\u0303 , g\u0303ij ) \u222a {q} by gluing the two manifolds (\u03a3\u0303 , g\u0303ij ) and\n\u2212\n(\u03a3\u0303\u2212 , g\u0303ij\n) along the surface V = 0 and adding the point\n2\nq. The calculations above imply that (\u03a3\u0303, g\u0303ij ) has zero\nmass and non-negative Ricci scalar. Note also that near\nthe point q (which corresponds to r \u2192 \u221e) we have\n(n\u22121)\nR\u0303\u2212 = O(r\u2212(n\u22123) ), so \u03a3\u0303\u2212 is regular at q 3 . Thus \u03a3\u0303\nis a Riemannian manifold with non-negative Ricci scalar\n\n2\n\n\u03a9\u00b1 =\n\n3n\u22124p\u22121\nn\u22123 V\n\n(19)\n\nwhere\n2\n! n\u22123\n\n1\u2213\n\nSince 0 \u2264 V \u2264 1, the \u03bb\u00b1 are positive-definite if\n\n(17)\n\nwhere xa is the coordinate on the level surfaces of V .\nDa is the covariant derivative with respect to hab . kab\nis the extrinsic curvature of V =const. surface and \u03c1 :=\n|Di V Di V |\u22121/2 . Then, from Eq. (16), one can easily see\nthat\nkab |V =0 = Da \u03c1|V =0 = 0\n\nwhere\n\n2\n\n=: \u03c9\u00b1n\u22123 .\n\n(20)\n\nThis conformal transformation is the same as the one\nemployed in the proof for the vacuum case [5, 13]. Now\n\n3\n\nNote that the resulting manifold \u03a3\u0303 is C 1 on the surface V = 0.\nThis is as in the vacuum case [5], since the conformal transformation is the same, as mentioned above.\nEven if the system has monopole charge, (n\u22121) R\u0303\u2212 =\nO(r \u2212(n\u22125) ). So \u03a3\u0303\u2212 will be regular whenever n \u2265 5. Our\nmethod of proof does not depend on which hair the system has.\nIf H0i1 ***ip\u22121 = O(1/r s ), (n\u22121) R\u0303\u2212 = O(r n\u22122p\u22122s+5 ). Then\nregularity requires s \u2265 (n + 1)/2 \u2212 (p \u2212 2).\n\n\f4\nand zero ADM mass. Then, by the positive energy theorem [19], \u03a3\u0303 is flat. So the metric g\u0303ij is flat and\nH0i1 ***ip\u22121 = 0 and \u03c6 = const\n\n(26)\n\nhold4 . That is, asymptotically flat static black holes in n\ndimensions cannot support an electric dipole p-form field\nstrength with p in the range (23), nor a nontrivial scalar\nfield.\nOnce we have ruled out the possibility of nontrivial pform and scalar fields, the problem is exactly the same\nas in vacuum and the results of [5] imply the uniqueness\nof the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini solution. For the sake\nof completeness, we briefly review this argument.\nWe have seen that \u03a3\u0303+ must be flat space. In addition, we can check that the extrinsic curvature of the\nsurface V = 0 on \u03a3\u0303+ is proportional to its induced metric with a constant coefficient. According to Kobayashi\nand Nomizu [21], such a surface in flat space is spherically\nsymmetric. Next, we define the function v by\nv=\n\n2\n.\n1+V\n\n(27)\n\nIt is easy to see that it is a harmonic function on flat\nspace \u03a3\u0303+ , that is,\n2\n\n\u2202 v = 0.\n\ncoupling \u03b1i to the dilaton, as long as each of the pi satisfies (23).\nAs mentioned above, the upper bound on p is a natural one given the requirement of asymptotic flatness.\nBut the physical motivation for the lower bound, if any,\nis unclear. Could static black holes support dipoles when\np < (n + 1)/2? The answer when p = 2 is known: the\nuniqueness theorem of [9] affirms that a static black hole\ncan have electric monopole charge, but not any higher\nmultipole. However, here we are more interested in p > 2\nwhere monopoles are not allowed. For instance, could\nthere be static black holes in n \u2265 6 with electric threeform, i.e., string, dipole? The heuristic argument presented in the introduction would seem to run counter\nto this possibility, but maybe this argument misses a\nway to balance or cancel the tension of dipole sources\nthat does not involve centrifugal forces. If this were\nthe case it would be a striking new feature of static\nblack holes afforded by higher dimensions. Alternatively,\nand more simply, maybe our no-dipole-hair theorem can\nbe strengthened to rule out all p-form dipoles whenever\np \u2264 n \u2212 1. This issue seems worthy of further investigation.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\n(28)\n\nWe have proven a no-dipole-hair theorem for p-form\nfields with p in the range (23). The proof can be straightforwardly extended to theories containing several electric\nform fields H(pi ) of different rank pi , each with its own\n\nThis work was initiated at Yukawa Institute, Kyoto\nUniversity.
