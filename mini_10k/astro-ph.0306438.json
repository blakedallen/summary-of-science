Since a modification to the EinsteinHilbert action of the form Rn , with n > 0, can lead to early-time inflation, our proposal provides a\nunified and purely gravitational origin for the early and late time accelerating phases of the Universe.\n\nIntroduction. That the expansion of the Universe is\ncurrently undergoing a period of acceleration now seems\ninescapable: it is directly measured from the light-curves\nof several hundred type Ia supernovae [1, 2, 3], and independently inferred from observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) by the WMAP satellite [4]\nand other CMB experiments [5, 6].\nCosmic speed-up can be accommodated within general\nrelativity by invoking a mysterious cosmic fluid with large\nnegative pressure, dubbed dark energy. The simplest possibility for dark energy is a cosmological constant; unfortunately, the smallest estimates for its value are 55 orders of magnitude too large (for reviews see [7, 8]). This\nfact has motivated a host of other possibilities, most of\nwhich assume a zero cosmological constant, with the dynamical dark energy being associated with a new scalar\nfield [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19].\nHowever, none of these suggestions is compelling and\nmost have serious drawbacks. Given the challenge of this\nproblem, it is worthwhile considering the possibility that\ncosmic acceleration is not due to some kind of stuff, but\nrather arises from new gravitational physics [20, 21, 22,\n23, 24]. This is the angle we pursue in this letter.\nGeneral relativity is based \u221a\nupon the Einstein-Hilbert\naction, with Lagrange density \u2212gR, where R is the curvature scalar. A natural modification is to add terms to\n\u221a\nthe action that are proportional to \u2212gRn . It is known\nthat, for n > 1, such terms lead to modifications of the\nstandard cosmology at early times which lead to de Sitter behavior (Starobinskii inflation [25]). Here, we show\nthat, for n < 0, such corrections become important in the\nlate Universe and can lead to self-accelerating vacuum\nsolutions, providing a purely gravitational alternative to\ndark energy.\n\n\u2217 carroll@theory.uchicago.edu\n\u2020 duvvuri@theory.uchicago.edu\n\u2021 trodden@physics.syr.edu\n\u00a7 mturner@oddjob.uchicago.edu\n\nThe self-accelerating solutions we find can behave like\nvacuum energy (i.e., wDE \u2261 PDE /\u03c1DE = \u22121), or can\nlead to power-law acceleration with cosmic scale factor\na \u221d tq , q > 1, and wDE < \u22122/3. We also argue that\nour model is consistent with existing tests of gravitation\ntheory and that the accelerating phase is consistent with\ncurrent cosmological observations.\nA Model. Many authors have considered modifying the\nEinstein-Hilbert action with terms that become effective\nin the high-curvature region. Here, however, we explore\nmodifications which become important at extremely low\ncurvatures to explain cosmic speed-up. For definiteness\nand simplicity we focus on the simplest correction to the\nEinstein-Hilbert action,\n\u0012\n\u0013 Z\nZ\n\u221a\n\u03bc4\nMP2\n4 \u221a\n+ d4 x \u2212g LM .

For work on theories where the\nLagrangian takes the form f (R), see [26, 27, 28, 29, 30,\n31, 32].\nThe field equation for the metric is then\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03bc4\n1\n\u03bc4\n1 \u2212 2 Rg\u03bc\u03bd\n1 + 2 R\u03bc\u03bd \u2212\nR\n2\nR\nM\n\u0002\n\u0003\nT\u03bc\u03bd\n+\u03bc4 g\u03bc\u03bd \u2207\u03b1 \u2207\u03b1 \u2212 \u2207(\u03bc \u2207\u03bd) R\u22122 =\n,\n(2)\nMP2\n\nM\nwhere T\u03bc\u03bd\nis the matter energy-momentum tensor.\nThe constant-curvature \u221avacuum solutions, for which\n\u2207\u03bc R = 0, satisfy R = \u00b1 3\u03bc2 . Thus, we find the interesting result that the constant-curvature vacuum solutions are not Minkowski space, but rather are de Sitter\nspace and anti de Sitter space. This bifurcation of the\nvacuum solutions from a unique one (Minkowski space)\nto two new ones (de Sitter and Anti-de Sitter spaces) as\n\u03bc4 is increased from zero is unusual and is to be contrasted with the case of a cosmological constant. We will\nsee that the de Sitter solution is, in fact, unstable, albeit\nwith a very long decay time \u03c4 \u223c \u03bc\u22121 .\n\n\f2\nWe consider a perfect-fluid energy-momentum tensor,\nM\nT\u03bc\u03bd\n= (\u03c1M + PM )U\u03bc U\u03bd + PM g\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere U a is the fluid rest-frame four-velocity, \u03c1M is\nthe energy density, PM is the pressure and we write\nPM = w\u03c1M . Matter corresponds to w = 0 and radiation to w = 1/3.

It is convenient to transform from our\ncurrent frame, which we call the matter frame, to the\nEinstein frame, where the gravitational Lagrangian takes\nthe Einstein-Hilbert form and the additional degrees of\nfreedom (\u1e26 and \u1e22) are represented by a fictitious scalar\nfield \u03c6.\nFollowing [29], we make a conformal transformation\n!\nr\n2 \u03c6\n\u03bc4\n\u2261 1 + 2 , (7)\ng\u0303\u03bc\u03bd = p(\u03c6)g\u03bc\u03bd , p \u2261 exp\n3 MP\nR\nwhere \u03c6 is a real scalar function on space-time, dt\u0303 =\n\u221a\n\u221a\npdt, and \u00e3(t) = pa(t).

Ordinarily,\nEinstein gravity with a scalar field with a minimum at\nV = 0 would yield a Minkowski vacuum state. However,\nhere this is no longer true. Even though V \u2192 0 as \u03c6 \u2192\n0, this corresponds to a curvature singularity and so is\nnot a Minkowski vacuum. The other minimum of the\npotential, at \u03c6 \u2192 \u221e, is clearly not a static solution.\nThese statements are also easily seen in the matter frame.\nNow let us first focus on vacuum cosmological solutions, i.e., PM = \u03c1M = 0. The beginning of the Universe\ncorresponds to R \u2192 \u221e and \u03c6 \u2192 0. The initial conditions\n\n\f3\nwe must specify are the initial values of \u03c6 and \u03c6\u2032 , denoted\nas \u03c6i and \u03c6\u2032 i . For simplicity we take \u03c6i \u226a MP . There\nare then three qualitatively distinct outcomes, depending\non the value of \u03c6\u2032 i .\n1. Eternal de Sitter. There is a critical value of\n\u03c6\u2032 i \u2261 \u03c6\u2032 C for which \u03c6 just reaches the maximum of the\npotential V (\u03c6) and comes to rest. In this case the Universe asymptotically evolves to a de Sitter solution (ignoring spatial perturbations). As we have discovered before (and is obvious in the Einstein frame), this solution\nrequires tuning and is unstable, since any perturbation\nwill induce the field to roll away from the maximum of\nits potential.\n2. Power-Law Acceleration. For \u03c6\u2032 i > \u03c6\u2032 C , the\nfield overshoots the maximum of V (\u03c6). Soon thereafter, the potential\nis well-approximated by V (\u03c6) \u2243\np\n\u03bc2 MP2 exp(\u2212 3/2\u03c6/MP ), and we easily solve for \u00e3(t\u0303) \u221d\nt\u03034/3 , which corresponds to a(t) \u221d t2 in the matter frame.\nThus, the Universe evolves to late-time power-law inflation, with observational consequences similar to dark energy with equation-of-state parameter wDE = \u22122/3.\n3. Future Singularity. For \u03c6\u2032 i < \u03c6\u2032 C , \u03c6 does not reach\nthe maximum of its potential and rolls back down to \u03c6 =\n0. This yields a future curvature singularity in which the\nHubble parameter remains finite in both the matter and\nEinstein frames, but its\n\u221a time derivative becomes infinite\nbecause \u1e22 \u221d V \u2032 \u2192 1/ \u03c6 \u2192 \u221e.\nWe now turn to the more interesting case in which the\nUniverse contains matter. As can be seen from (10), the\nmajor difference here is that the equation-of-motion for \u03c6\nin the Einstein frame has a new term. Furthermore, since\nthe matter density is much greater than V \u223c \u03bc2 MP2 for\nt \u226a 14 Gyr, this term is very large and greatly affects the\nevolution of \u03c6. The exception is when the matter content\nis radiation alone (w = 1/3), in which case it decouples\nfrom the \u03c6 equation due to conformal invariance.\nDespite this complication, it is possible to show that\nthe three possible cosmic futures identified in the vacuum\ncase remain in the presence of matter. To see this, first\nnote that, if we ignore the V \u2032 term in (10) because it\nis subdominant at early times, and assume that 3H\u0303 2 =\n\u03c1\u0303M /MP2 , we obtain\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03c6 (t\u0303) = \u03c6 (t\u03030 )\n\n\u0012\n\n\u00e30\n\u00e3\n\n\u00133\n\nC\n+\u221a\n6\n\n\u0012\n\nt\u0303 \u2212 t\u03030\n\u00e33\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(15)\n\nfor w = 0, and\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03c6 (t\u0303) = \u03c6 (t\u03030 )\n\n\u0012\n\n\u00e30\n\u00e3\n\n\u00133\n\n,\n\n(16)\n\nfor w = 1/3.\nThe value of \u03c6\u2032 redshifts as it would for a free scalar\nfield and, for w = 0, increases dramatically due to\nthe presence of matter. By tuning \u03c6\u2032i , the value of \u03c6\u2032\nat the epoch when matter becomes unimportant (i.e.,\n\n\u03c1\u0303M < \u03bc2 MP2 ) can be adjusted, resulting in the same three\nfutures as in the vacuum theory.\nThus far, we have left the dimensionful parameter \u03bc\nunspecified beyond the requirement that it be sufficiently\nsmall that precision tests of gravity theory are not affected (see below). By choosing \u03bc \u223c 10\u221233 eV, the corrections to the standard cosmology only become important\nat the present epoch, making our theory a candidate to\nexplain the observed acceleration of the Universe without recourse to dark energy. It is, of course, important\nto be clear that we have merely chosen the value of \u03bc\nto achieve this end. Since we have no particular reason\nfor this choice, such a tuning appears no more attractive\nthan the traditional choice of the cosmological constant.\nHowever, it is intriguing to note that, in the present circumstance, the smallness of the 1/R term in the action is\ndirectly related to the lateness of the accelerating phase.\nThus, even an extremely tiny correction to the Einstein\naction can eventually have dramatic consequences.\nClearly our choice of correction to the gravitational action can be generalized. Terms of the form \u2212\u03bc2(n+1) /Rn ,\nwith n > 1, lead to similar late-time self acceleration.\nSuch actions can be transformed into the Einstein frame\nwith scalar field potential\nV (p) = \u03bc2 MP2\n\n\u0012\n\nn+1\n2n\n\n\u0013\n\nn1/(n+1)\n\n(p \u2212 1)n/(n+1)\n,\np2\n\n(17)\n\nwith resulting matter-frame scale factor a(t) \u221d tq , where\nq=\n\n(2n + 1)(n + 1)\n.\nn+2\n\n(18)\n\nSuch a modification thus yields behavior similar to a dark\nenergy component with equation of state parameter\nweff = \u22121 +\n\n2(n + 2)\n.\n3(2n + 1)(n + 1)\n\n(19)\n\nAs n \u2192 \u221e the expansion approaches an exponential and\nthe space-time is approximately de Sitter. Clearly therefore, such modifications can easily accommodate current\nobservational bounds [33, 34] on the equation of state\nparameter \u22121.45 < wDE < \u22120.74 (95% confidence level).\nFinally, any modification of the Einstein-Hilbert action must, of course, be consistent with the classic solar\nsystem tests of gravity theory, as well as numerous other\nastrophysical dynamical tests. Many such tests depend\non the Schwarzschild solution, which Birkhoff's theorem\nensures is the unique, static, spherically-symmetric solution. It is simple to prove a related result here: that the\nmost general, static, spherically-symmetric solutions are\nthe Schwarzschild-(anti) de Sitter solutions. These solutions differ, of course, from the familiar Schwarzschild\nsolution, which asymptotically approaches Minkowski\nspace. However, it is clear that, if the parameter \u03bc4 is\nchosen small enough, any astrophysical tests of gravity\n\n\f4\nthat depend on the Schwarzschild solution will be unaffected by the modification we have made. We expect\nsimilar arguments will hold for the cases of charged black\nholes and those with angular momentum.\nConcluding Remarks. We have shown that the current\nepoch of cosmic acceleration can arise through purely\ngravitational effects, eliminating the need for dark energy. In particular, modifications to the Einstein\u2013Hilbert\naction of the form \u2212\u03bc2(n+1) /Rn , with \u03bc \u223c 10\u221233 eV and\nn < 0, can lead to cosmic speed up with \u22121 < weff \u2264\n\u22122/3.\nThere is, of course, growing evidence from measurements of CMB anisotropy, as well as of large-scale structure, that the Universe also evolved through a period\nof accelerated expansion very early on, known as inflation. It is also known that modifications to the EinsteinHilbert action of the form m\u22122 R2 , with m a mass parameter, yield an Einstein-frame potential\n(p \u2212 1)2\n,\n(20)\n8p\np\nwhere, as before, p \u2261 exp[ 2/3\u03c6/MP ]. In this case,\nthe beginning of the Universe occurs at large \u03c6 and the\nUniverse undergoes inflation. Thus, our work implies\nthat it is possible for both eras of cosmic acceleration\nto arise from the gravitational sector of the theory, with\ngeneral relativity being a valid description of the Universe\nonly at intermediate cosmic times.\nThere are certainly many other details of this theory\nthat remain to be checked. In particular, we would like\nto analyze quantitatively the behavior of the transition\nfrom matter domination to self acceleration as well as\nthe growth of linearized perturbations about the given\nbackground solutions we have identified.\nWe thank C.
