In this approach, every\npoint on the potential energy landscape (PEL) [2], which describes the highdimensional N -body configurational potential energy function, is uniquely\nmapped to its nearest energy minimum or the mechanically stable, or jammed,\n\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier\n\n11 November 2018\n\n\fconfiguration. The structure corresponding to this jammed configuration is\nknown as an inherent structure. By grouping together configurations that map\nto the same inherent structure into local basins of attraction, it is possible to\nexpress the partition function as a sum over the inherent structures and their\nassociated local basin. This gives rise to two distinct entropies: the configurational entropy associated with the number of accessible inherent structures\nand the vibrational entropy due to the degrees of freedom within the basin.\nAdam and Gibbs [3] suggested that the observed slowing down of the dynamics in supercooled liquids with cooling resulted in a dramatic decrease in the\nnumber of accessible basins on the potential energy landscape. In principle, if\nthe liquid could be cooled sufficiently, without either crystallizing or getting\nkinetically trapped in higher potential energy minima, it might eventually become trapped in the single deepest liquid basin, which would represent an\nideal glass.\nIn the case of hard potential systems, one partitions the density landscape\n(DL) [4] by mapping each configuration of the fluid at a density \u03c1 to a its\nclosest density maximum, \u03c10 , which is the inherent structure and corresponds\nto a collectively jammed packed configuration [8]. The number of inherent\nstructures for a hard potential system is expected to be given by [2],\n\u03a9(\u03c10 ) = exp[N sc (\u03c10 )] ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere N is the number of particles and sc is the configurational entropy per\nparticle. The ideal glass transition would correspond to a density \u03c1 when\nthe liquid becomes trapped in a single basin so that \u03a9(\u03c10 ) becomes subexponential i.e., when sc = 0.\nWhile packing algorithms can exhaustively generate all the inherent structures\nin small systems [6,7,9,10], an exact enumeration of packings for thermodynamically sized systems is only available for very simple models [11]. Since\nit is difficult to create and count random packings, another approach is to\nfocus on counting the jammed structures that can be generated from lattice\nstructures [12]. Computer simulations of binary hard disc mixtures [13] that\nestimate \u03a9(\u03c10 ) by comparing the entropy of the equilibrium liquid to that\nof the system constrained to the basin of one of the inherent structures to\nwhich the liquid maps, suggest that the distribution of inherent structures is\nGaussian. However, it is difficult to maintain equilibrium in the fluid at high\ndensities and the ideal glass density is obtained by extrapolating the distribution to higher densities. The existence of the ideal glass clearly depends\non the details of this extrapolation [14,15]. Simulations of polydispersed hard\nspheres [16] at high densities point to an absence of a thermodynamic glass\ntransition and a recent simulation of a binary mixture of hard discs [17] finds\nan exponential number of inherent structures up to the crystallization density,\nwhich suggests there is no ideal glass transition in this system.\n2\n\n\fA physically motivated argument [18] shows that the number of inherent structures for systems with short range potentials is always exponential with respect\nto the system size. However, a key element of this approach requires the division of volume into molecularly sized, but mechanically stable, subvolumes.\nThis ignores the more global nature of the unjamming process in hard potential systems [8] which may lead to a reduction in the number of jammed\nstructures. The goal of the present paper is to develop a tiling approach to\ncounting inherent structures in systems with hard core potentials that will account for the collective nature of unjamming. Section 2 introduces the details\nof the tiles and tile incompatibilities while Section 3 examines some of the\nproperties of the geometric quantities arising from our method. The method\nis applied to a system of confined discs in Section 4 and Section 5 contains\nour discussion and conclusions.\n\n2\n\nTiles and tile incompatibility\n\nLocally jammed hard particles are unable to move, due to the nonoverlap\nrequirement of the potential, if the neighboring particles in contact are held\nfixed [8]. For example, a two dimensional hard disc will be jammed if it has\nat least three fixed contacts that are not all in the same semicircle. A packing constructed entirely of locally jammed particles may not be collectively\njammed because collective motions of several particles could allow the packing to collapse. However, a collectively jammed state must consist entirely\nof locally jammed particles. This suggests that we may be able to construct\ncollectively jammed configurations by adding locally jammed particles to a\n\"growing\" packing, in a manner similar to Bernal's original work on liquid\nstructure [19], but after each addition, we eliminate those configurations that\nwould result in packings that are not collectively jammed.\nHere, we explore the possibility of counting inherent structures by using this\nconfigurational growth process and representing local packing environments\nof the particles as tiles. Several possible methods for defining these tiles exist,\nincluding the Voronoi and Delaunay tesselations [20] and the construction by\nBlumenfield and Edwards (BE) [22,21] that appears to provide a description of the phase space of granular and cellular systems by tiling the plane\n(in two dimensions) with quadrilaterals referred to as quadrons. Most reasonable methods of mapping jammed particle configurations to tiles will result in\npolygon shaped objects that can be combined with a set of rules that ensure\nthe local packing conditions are satisfied. For example, in the simplest case,\nedge matching rules will be required to guarantee local space filling. Additional global restrictions will be required to ensure that N tiles cover all of\nthe volume V without leaving gaps (tiling condition), and that the arrangement is collectively jammed. Since the addition of each set of constraints for\n3\n\n\flocal jamming and collective jamming reduces the number of allowable states\nat a given density, it follows that\n\u03a9(\u03c10 ) \u2264 \u03a9l (\u03c10 ) \u2264 \u03a9t (\u03c10 ),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03a9l (\u03c10 ) and \u03a9t (\u03c10 ) are the number of configurations with density \u03c10\nthat are both locally jammed and satisfy the tiling condition, and those that\nsatisfy the tiling condition alone, respectively. There has been a considerable\namount of work on packing algorithms in confined systems [7] and these\nalgorithms can be used to construct a large enough configuration from which\none can identify a set of tiles that represent all the possible local jamming\nenvironments.\nWe begin by defining the first order prototile set T1 = {t11 , t21 ...} of the tilings\nwhich give rise to jammed configurations of density \u03c10 . The following should\nhold for the first order prototiles [23] (from now on, referred to as first order tiles): (a) tiles are (closed) topological discs, (b) the tiles are mutually\nnon-congruent and (c) every tile should enclose one particle. These conditions\nshould allow every inherent structure to be constructed from the elements\nof T1 . An underlying assumption in our scheme is that, for jammed configurations, one is restricted to a countable number of local arrangements and\nparticle neighborhoods, giving rise to a finite set of non-congruent tiles. In a\nsystem with periodic boundaries in all directions, one might expect the tiles\nto have an unrestricted number of allowable orientations. By imposing linear\nboundary conditions, the rotational degrees of freedom of the tiles should be\nrestricted to a finite set of rigid motions.\nEach element of T1 , ti1 , where the superscript i identifies a unique member of\nthe set and the subscript 1 denotes the fact that these tiles are elementary\nor first order tiles, represents a single particle and its packing environment.\nA tile consists of a set of boundary points, bi1 , that denotes the edge of the\ntile, and a set of interior points v1i . An arrangement of N tiles chosen from T1 ,\ncontained in the area or volume to be tiled, H, is called a valid tiling of H,\nif and only if: (i) no gap exists between the tiles i.e., all points x \u2208 H belong\nto at least one tile and every point in the tiles belongs to H, (ii) there is no\noverlapping of tiles i.e., for every pair of first order tiles, ti1 and tj1 , in the tiling,\nv1i \u222a v1j = \u2205 and (iii) there is collective jamming i.e., the configuration arising\nout of the tiling of H should be collectively jammed. If these criteria do not\nhold for an arrangement of tiles, it is called an invalid tiling. This defines our\ntiling requirement. Every inherent structure of density \u03c10 is a valid tiling of\nH.\nTwo tiles, ti1 and tj1 , are neighbors if they do not overlap but share boundaries.\nIf two tiles ti1 , tj1 \u2208 T1 are neighbors, the resulting tile tl2 = ti1 \u222atj1 is said to be a\ntile of order two if they match edges. The elements of the set T2 should satisfy\n4\n\n\f(a),(b) and should enclose two particles. For tiles of order two or more, the\ncriterion (a) is qualified further, i.e., two tiles need not be mutually congruent\nif the arrangement of the particles in the tiles is different. In general we define\na k th order tile as the union of a tile ti1 with a neighbor tile of order k \u2212 1.\nThe elements of Tk should satisfy (a),(b) and enclose k particles. In addition,\nit is critical to test any k th order tile for jamming at that level. This can be\nachieved by fixing each of the particles in the boundary tiles and randomly\nperturbing the interior particles to test for unjamming motions [26]. If the k th\norder tile turns out to be globally jammed at its level, it is said to belong to\nTk and we progress to the k + 1th order. This describes how we create higher\norder tiles by successively adding first order tiles to the growing structure.\nWe now introduce incompatibility rules, along with a number of other parameters, to capture the effects of geometric frustration in the inherent structure\nenumeration. Let nij\n1 be the number of distinct ways we can edge match tiles\nj\ni\nt1 and t1 as neighbors, such that they belong to T2 . This also represents the\nnumber of sites where we can join the two tiles. If nij\n1 = 0 for a particular\npair of tiles, we say these tiles are incompatible. The total number of incompatibilities of ti1 with the other tiles of T1 is the degree of incompatibility, ci1 .\nThe notion of incompatibility can be generalised to higher order tiles if nij\nk is\nj\nth\ndefined as the number of distinct ways we can add t1 to the k order tile, tik ,\nto generate a new k + 1 order tile belonging to Tk+1 . Accordingly, the degree\nof incompatibility cik , is the number of first order tiles tik is incompatible with.\nIf P1 is the number of first order tiles, then the number of second order tiles\nis given by\nP2 = f 2\n\nP1 X\nP1\nX\nji\n\nn1 ,\n\n(3)\n\nj=1 i=1\n\nwhere f2 is the fraction of the newly generated tiles that are mutually noncongruent in general (unless the configuration of particles in the congruent tiles\nij\nij\nis different). Similarly, one defines f3 , f4 ..., fN and nij\n2 , n3 ...., nN for higher\norder tiles. The fractions {fi } depend upon the geometric symmetry of the\ntiles and will depend on the kind of mapping procedure employed to map\nconfigurations to tiles e.g., fi may be different when the tiles are obtained from\na Voronoi construction rather than a quadron construction [21,22]. Extending\nthis argument, one can write the number of ways of obtaining distinct k th\norder tiles as\nPk = f k\n\nPk\nP1 X\nX\nji\n\nnk\u22121 .\n\n(4)\n\nj=1 i=1\n\nWhile this approach is quite general, it is apparent that fk and nji\nk\u22121 are going\n5\n\n\fto be complicated functions of k that may be difficult to obtain for many\nmodels. For example {fi } will depend upon the geometric symmetry of the\ntiles, but will lie in the range 1 \u2265 fk \u2265 P1k , while nji\nk\u22121 will be dependent on\nth\nthe surface area of a given k order tile. However, as we show in section 4,\nthese quantities become quite simple if we consider highly confined packings,\nso this approach may be useful under these circumstances.\n\n3\n\nBounds on enumeration\n\nThe enumeration of inherent structures is at the heart of the problem of the\nideal glass transition. Stillinger [18] argues that the upper and lower limits\nof the number of distinguishable inherent structures is exponential in system\nsize. The lower bound becoming exponential in system size precludes the formation of an ideal glass. The main assumption in this argument is that the\nsystem can be divided into subvolumes which are large enough that the defects\ninteraction between neighboring subvolumes is weak. This divides the system\ninto independent and permutationally equivalent regions, the combinations\nof which correspond to distinguishable inherent structures. In our methodology, the tiles are not permutationally equivalent and the compatibility rules\nbetween the neighboring tiles govern whether a configuration is an inherent\nstructure or not.\nWe calculate bounds to the number of packings obtained by taking different\nlimiting cases on the degree of compatibility. We expect nij\nk to be proportional\nto the surface area of the k th order tile and the maximum value to occur in\ntiles that are highly ramified. n\u2217k should initially increase with increasing tile\norder, but must eventually go through a maximum and start to decrease as the\ntile percolates through space and the addition of new first order tiles begins to\nfill in the gaps. Given the complexity of nji\nk\u22121 , we simply define its maximum\nP ji\n\u2217\nvalue nk = max{ i nk }. Following on from Eq. 3, the upper limit on the\nnumber of k th order tiles is given by\n\u2217\nPk\u22121\n\nPk \u2264\n\nPk\u2217\n\n=\n\nfk n\u2217k\u22121\n\nX\n\nP1 \u2212 cjk\u22121 ,\n\n(5)\n\nj=1\n\nwhich provides the upper bound to the number of inherent structures we can\ngenerate as\n\u2217\nPN\n\u22121\n\n\u03a9(\u03c10 ) \u2264\n\nPN\u2217\n\n=\n\nfN n\u2217N \u22121\n\nX\n\nP1 \u2212 cjN \u22121 .\n\nj=1\n\n6\n\n(6)\n\n\fIf we choose cjm = 0, for all j, m, we obtain the maximum value PN\u2217 as\n(PN\u2217 )max\n\n=\n\nN\nY\n\nnk\u22121 fk P1N ,\n\n(7)\n\nk=2\n\nwhich shows \u03a9(\u03c10 ) increases exponentially with N . This is consistent with\nSillinger's upper bound [18].\nIt is interesting to see if our relations will allow for a subexponential enumeration of inherent structures. This is possible when the number of new tiles\ngenerated from an existing tile is minimized by maximizing the number of\nincompatibilities so that, for any given tile, only one of the P1 first order tiles\ncan be added. This leads to the constraint, cjk\u22121 = P1 \u2212 1 for all j, k, and gives\nrise to the following recursive series:\n\n(P2\u2217 )min =\n\nP1\nX\n\nn1 f2 = n1 f2 P1\n\n(8)\n\nj\n\u2217 )\n(Pi\u22121\nmin\n\n(Pi\u2217 )min\n\nX\n\n=\n\nni f i =\n\nj=1\n\n(PN\u2217 )min\n\n=\n\nN\nY\n\ni\nY\n\nnk\u22121 fk P1\n\nk=2\n\nnk\u22121 fk P1 .\n\nk=2\n\nSince there can only be one inherent structure, {fi } and {ni } must satisfy\nN\nY\nk=2\n\nnk\u22121 fk \u223c\n\n1\n.\nP1\n\n(9)\n\nIn a simple crystal with only one tile type, P1 = 1, so the upper bound given\nQ\nby Eq. 7 is equal to the lower bound given by Eq. 9 and N\nk=2 nk\u22121 fk = 1.\nIn the case of an ideal glass, we might expect P1 > 1, but we also note the\nconstraint that only one new tile is generated at each k is much stronger than\nwould be required for a system to have only one inherent structure. We would\nlike to once again emphasize that, since the boundary is fixed, the number of\npossible orientations of a tile is finite. Stillinger's subvolumes implicitly invoke\nthe same assumptions.\n\n4\n\nPackings of highly confined discs in two dimensions\n\nIn general, nk and fk will be complicated functions but they become simplified\nin confined systems. As an example, we will consider a simple system of hard\n7\n\n\fdiscs of diameter q\n\u03c3, confined between two hard lines separated by a distance\n1 < H/\u03c3 < 1 + 3/4, for which the complete enumeration of the inherent\nstructures was investigated earlier [11]. Due to the narrow separation of the\nwalls, the discs are only able to contact one nearest neighbour on each side and\nthe walls. This only allows for two distinct conformations: (a) two adjacent\ndiscs have the same height in the channel (for example tile 3-4 in Fig. 1) or\n(b) when they contact across the channel (e.g. tiles 2-3, 4-5 in Fig. 1). One\nreadily obtains a binomial distribution for the enumeration of the inherent\nstructures with respect to \u03c1o . Our present implementation for the counting\nis more cumbersome than necessary for this model, but it provides a useful\ncomparison and helps to illustrate our scheme which is more generally applicable. Additionally, the model has the advantage that any k th order tile is\nnaturally jammed, hence no additional perturbation check is required. Fig. 1\nshows two distinct configurations which are enough to illustrate the tiles that\ncan be used to construct any jammed state for this system. The limited number of geometrical arrangements for the local packings makes the first order\ntile set easy to obtain (see Fig. 1). A total of 14 distinct tiles can be identified,\nnumbered from 1 to 7, and their mirror images parallel to the walls, which are\nprimed. An arrangement of tiles (2-3-4-5) is referred to as a \"defect\". The top\nconfiguration in Fig. 1 shows an isolated defect while the bottom shows two\nneighboring defects. These configurations give rise to different tiles due to the\nway space is shared between the discs.\n\nWe are now in a position to construct the inherent structures. Building the\ntiles from left to right such that the right tile disc should touch the left\ndisc and using edge matching for the compatibility rules yields 30 second\norder tiles : 1-1',1-2',2-3,3-4,3-4',3-6,3-6',4-5,5-1',5-2',6-7',7-6',7-6,7-4,7-4', 1'1,1'-2,2'-3',3'-4',3'-4,3'-6',3'-6,4'-5',5'-1,5'-2,6'-7,7'-6,7'-6',7'-4',7'-4. Note that\n6-7' and 6'-7' are of the same shape, but yield different confirmation of particle\npositions and are still distinct. Therefore, we have 30 distinct tiles and hence\nf2 = 1. Using these 30 tiles, we generate the following third order tiles: 1-1'-1,11'-2,1-2'-3',2-3-4,2-3-4',2-3-6,2-3-6',3-4-5,3-4'-5',3-6-7',3-6'-7',4-5-1',4-5-2',5-1'1,5-1'-2,5-2'-3',6-7'-6',6-7'-6,6-7'-4',6-7'-4,7-6'-7',7-6-7',7-4-5,7-4'-5'. We can complement this sequence of tiles (e.g., A-B'-C' \u2192 A'-B-C) and get their corresponding mirror images, which are also valid tiles of order three. Continuing\nthis process would give rise to all possible jammed configurations. In Fig. 2,\nwe compare the number of inherent structures obtained from our tile counting\nmechanism and the actual number of inherent structures for this model. The\nenumeration by tiling is larger by orders of magnitude because the mapping\nprocess produces different tiles capable of producing the same start and end\nto a configuration. This problem of over counting can be eliminated by storing the distinctly different inherent structures obtained and calculating the\nEuclidean distance between the new structure obtained from the tiling at the\nlast stage. If a configuration is degenerate, it is rejected.\n8\n\n\f5\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe main goal of the present work was to develop an approach for counting\nthe inherent structures of hard core potential models such as hard discs and\nhard spheres. A key element of our approach is to note that the collectively\njammed states, or inherent structures, must be constructed by combining subunits of locally jammed states. Recent simulations studies of hard sphere packings [24,25] have pointed to the important role of tetrahedral packing units.\nAnikeenko and Medvedev [25] show that the volume fraction of polytetrahedra\nincreases as the density of the packing increases, with the most dense amorphous packing occurring when all N spheres of the packing are involved in the\ntetrahedral sub-units. These elementary structures could be represented by\nthe first order tiles in our approach. However, building a packing from locally\njammed structures does not ensure that it will tile space, or, even if it does,\nthat the packing will be collectively jammed. Our method deals with these\ngeometric constraints by introducing tile incompatibility. In particular, our\nincompatibilities are tested by checking if a k th tile can combine with a first\norder tile in order to collectively jam, using an appropriate test (such as perturbation) of the collectively jammed state. Our criteria for an incompatibility\naccounts for the global nature of jamming even though the tile construction\nis based on local geometric factors. This sets our approach apart from earlier\nanalytical approaches and is important because unjamming events can involve\na significant proportion of the particles in the system.\nOur tiling approach requires a knowledge of all the local packing environments, but this is usually not known a priori. To make our approach truly\nuseful, we suggest the following practical implementation: We quench a few\nconfigurations of a large system, or use local packing algorithms [6,7] for densities which are not obtainable from quenches, to generate a set of collectively\njammed states. Then, we use this set of configurations to identify both the\nlocal structures that correspond to the first order tiles and the incompatibilities. It should be possible to identify the local packing structures by studying\na subset of the inherent structures, at a given density, using large system sizes.\nThe main challenge is to choose order parameters that clearly distinguish each\nof the tiles but, as discussed above, progress is already being made in this direction. Some incompatibilities can also be identified by studying collectively\njammed states generated by simulation and recognising which tile combinations occur, and which ones do not. Alternatively, algorithms that identify the\nunjamming motions of a packing could be used to identify those combinations\nof locally jammed structures that are not collectively jammed [26].\nOne of the authors, SSA, would like to thank Niels Ellegaard for his comments\non the manuscript.
