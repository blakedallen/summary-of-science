The intra\u2013\nchain correlation functions represent a fundamental link between the equilibrium thermodynamic observables and the\nconformational structure of polymers. These functions for polymers exhibit rather different behavior depending on\nthe solvent quality. TPCF of a homopolymer in a good solvent follows a universal scaling scaling law [39] for which\nanalytical expressions can be derived by the field theoretical and other approaches [1, 2, 3]. On the contrary, the\nTPCF in a poor solvent exhibit a complicated oscillating radial dependence akin to that of simple liquids. In this\ncase, there is no known simply parametrized representation of TPCF for the homopolymer globule. Moreover, an\naccurate sampling around a rather tall peak corresponding to the first solvation shell becomes very significant as this\npeak contributes most to the thermodynamic observables such as the mean energy. On the other hand, TPCF in a\ngood solvent obtained from molecular mechanics simulations tend to be rather noisy due to the high entropy of the\ncoil conformation. This results in a large scatter of values of TPCF at small radial separations, which makes further\nfitting of the data by an analytical expression and extraction of the scaling exponents difficult. Therefore, in general,\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: Maxim.Fedorov@ucd.ie\naddress: genchuev@rambler.ru\n\u2021 Electronic address: Yuri.Kuznetsov@ucd.ie\n\u00a7 URL: http://darkstar.ucd.ie ; Electronic address: Edward.Timoshenko@ucd.ie; Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.\n\u2020 Electronic\n\n\f2\ndealing with TPCF data of heteropolymers, for which some monomers are in a good solvent while others are in a\npoor solvent, and, particularly, extracting meaningful information from such data is a rather nontrivial problem.\n(2)\nRelying on the recent works of some of us [4, 5, 6], we believe that the task of parameterizing gij (r) in a compact\nway can be accomplished by means of the multiresolution analysis [7, 8]. At present, a number of special basis sets,\nreferred to as wavelets [9], are known and are being actively used for treating both smooth and sharply oscillating\nfunctions, as well as for denoising of signals [10, 11]. Wavelets became a necessary mathematical tool in many modern\ntheoretical investigations in Physics, Chemistry and other fields [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. Wavelets\nare particularly useful in those cases when the result of the analysis of a function should contain not only the list\nof its typical frequencies (scales), but also the list of the local coordinates where these frequencies are important.\nThus, the main field of applications of wavelets is to analyse and process different classes of functions which are either\nnonstationary (in time) or inhomogeneous (in space).\nThe most general principle of the wavelet construction is to use dilations and translations. Commonly used wavelets\nform a complete (bi)orthonormal system of functions with a finite support constructed in such a way. That is why\nby changing a scale (dilations) wavelets can distinguish the local characteristics of a function at various scales, and\nby translations they cover the whole region in which a function is being studied. Due to the completeness of the base\nsystem, wavelets also allow one to perform the inverse transformation to decomposition, which is called reconstruction.\nIn the analysis of functions with a complicated behavior, the locality property of wavelets makes the wavelet\ntransform technique substantially advantageous compared to the Fourier transform. The latter provides one only\nwith the knowledge of global frequencies (scales) of a function under investigation since the system of the base\nfunctions used (sine, cosine or imaginary exponential functions) is defined on the infinite range. The special features\nof wavelets such as their (bi)orthogonality and vanishing of moments result in the need for only few approximating\ncoefficients in practical applications. That is a reason why wavelets are actively used, for example, to construct\ndistribution functions in calculations of the electronic structure [19, 20, 21] as well as in Statistical Mechanics [4, 5, 6].\nRecently, some of us, have carried out several studies devoted to the wavelet parametrization of the radial density\nfunctions for various atomic and molecular solutes [4, 5, 6]. A model study of the galaxies density in Ref. [22]\nuses a similar wavelet approach for a different problem. In the present work we would like to address the question\nwhether wavelets can also be advantageous for approximating the intra\u2013chain correlation functions of homopolymers\nin different solvents. The main practical goal of this paper is to apply discrete wavelets for approximating functions\n(2)\ngij (r) of open, ring and star homopolymers in a coil conformation, as well as of a globule. In the case of a coil, the\ndes Cloizeaux scaling formula applies and a number of accurate theoretical results for the scaling exponents involved\nare available [1, 23]. Thus, we shall be able to investigate the influence of the choice of the wavelet basis set and of\nthe number of terms not only on the quality of the correlation function parameterization, but also on the values of\nthe scaling exponents extracted from fitting the wavelet denoised functions by the des Cloizeaux formula.\nII.\n\nMETHODS\nA.\n\nModel\n\nTo obtain the correlation functions we relied on the standard coarse\u2013grained homopolymer model [24, 25, 26] based\non the following Hamiltonian in terms of the monomer coordinates, Xi :\nkB T X\n\u03baij (Xi \u2212 Xj )2\n2l2 i\u223cj\n1 X\n+\nV (|Xi \u2212 Xj |).\n2\n\nH =\n\n(1)\n\nij, i6=j\n\nThe first term here represents the connectivity structure of the polymer with harmonic springs of a given strength\n\u03baij introduced between any pair of connected monomers (denoted by i \u223c j). The second term represents pair\u2013wise\nnon\u2013bonded interactions between monomers such as the van der Waals forces, for which we adopt the Lennard\u2013Jones\nform of the potential,\n(\n+\u221e,\nr<d\n\u0010 \u000112\n\u0001 \u0011\n,\n(2)\nV (r) =\nd 6\nd\n, r>d\n\u2212 r\nV0 r\n\nwhere there is also a hard core part with the monomer diameter d (below we choose d = l without any lack of\ngenerality).\n\n\f3\nWe use the Monte Carlo technique with the standard Metropolis algorithm [27], which converges to the Gibbs\nequilibrium ensemble, based upon the implementation described by us in [25]. Value of V0 = 0 will correspond to the\npurely repulsive case (good solvent) leading to a coil conformation of the polymer, while V0 = 5 kB T will correspond\nto the attractive case (poor solvent) leading to a globular conformation as in Ref. [28]. All details of our Monte Carlo\nprocedure have been previously described in the paper [28] and, in fact, here we shall rely on the same set of Monte\nCarlo simulation data in order to make the comparison of the wavelet treated scaling exponents with those of Ref.\n[28] more straightforward and unambiguous.\nB.\n\nCorrelation functions\n\nThe intra\u2013chain two\u2013point correlation function (TPCF) of a pair of monomers i and j is defined as,\n(2)\n\ngij (r) \u2261 \u03b4(Xi \u2212 Xj \u2212 r) =\n\n1\n\u03b4(|Xi \u2212 Xj | \u2212 r) .\n4\u03c0r2\n\n(3)\n\nThe second equation establishes that it is a function of radius r = |r| only due to spatial isotropy (SO(3) rotational\nsymmetry). We may note that this function should, strictly speaking, be named distribution function, but since\n(2)\n(2)\ngij (r) \u2192 0 when r \u2192 \u221e because of the chain connectivity, we apply the term 'correlation function' to gij (r) itself\n(2)\n\nrather than to the quantity gij (r)/(g (1) )2 \u2212 1, which would vanish as r \u2192 \u221e in the case of simple liquids. The\nR\n(2)\nfunction is normalized to unity via: d3 r gij (r) = 1. Note that the correlation functions exactly satisfy the excluded\n(2)\n\nvolume condition, gij (r) = 0 for r < d, due to the choice of the hard\u2013core part in the non\u2013bonded potential Eq. (2).\nThe mean\u2013squared distance between monomers i and j is,\n\u001d Z\n\u001c\n(2)\n(4)\nDij \u2261 (Xi \u2212 Xj )2 = d3 r |r|2 gij (r),\n\nwhich we defined here without the traditional factor of 1/3 as compared to some of the previous papers [25].\n(2)\nThe intra\u2013chain pair correlation functions gij (r) are strongly dependent on both the degree of polymerization K\nof the polymer and the choice of the reference monomers i and j, contacts between which we are looking at. However,\nas we have demonstrated in Ref. [28], if we introduce the rescaled correlation function in terms of the dimensionless\nvariables,\n3/2\n\n(2)\n\n\u011dij (r\u0302) \u2261 Dij\n\n(2)\n\ngij (r) ,\n\n1/2\n\nr\u0302 \u2261 r/Dij ,\n\n(5)\n\nthese will change in about the same range and hence would permit a much more straightforward comparison with\n(2)\neach other. From this definition, obviously, \u011dij (r\u0302) satisfies the following two normalization conditions:\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n(2)\n\ndr\u0302 r\u03022 \u011dij (r\u0302) =\n\nC.\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n(2)\n\ndr\u0302 r\u03024 \u011dij (r\u0302) =\n\n1\n.\n4\u03c0\n\n(6)\n\nScaling Relations\n\nAccording to Refs. [1, 3] TPCF of a flexible homopolymer coil in a good solvent can be well described [28] via a\npower law times a stretched exponential, known as the des Cloizeaux scaling equation,\n\u0001\n(2)\n\u011dij (r\u0302) = Aij r\u0302\u03b8ij exp \u2212Bij r\u0302\u03b4ij .\n\n(7)\n\nDue to the two normalization conditions in Eq. (6) constants A and B can be immediately calculated and expressed\nvia \u03b8 and \u03b4. The exponents \u03b4ij do not really depend on i, j, but the contact exponents \u03b8ij do. In the case of the\nend\u2013end correlations of an open chain \u03b8ij is denoted as \u03b80 , and these can be expressed via,\n\u03b4=\n\n1\n,\n1\u2212\u03bd\n\n\u03b80 =\n\n\u03b3\u22121\n,\n\u03bd\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03bd has the meaning of the inverse fractal dimension of the system and \u03b3 is related to the number of different\npolymer conformations [1, 3].\n\n\f4\nD.\n\nWavelet Theory\n\nThe fundamental theory behind wavelets is known as the Multi\u2013Resolution Analysis (MRA). Most of the rigorous\nresults and definitions from MRA are not usually required for practical applications. The only equations which\nare needed for the work described herein will be introduced in this section. As we mainly use basis sets from the\nbiorthogonal wavelets families, we shall introduce all wavelets in a general way as biorthogonal wavelets. Moreover,\nwe shall use the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) technique [7, 9] to parameterize the TPCFs. There is a good\nintroduction to the wavelet techniques in Ref. [15]. We also will follow the style of that book henceforth. The\nmultiresolution approach is based on the idea that the wavelet functions generate hierarchical sequence of subspaces\nin the space of square\u2013integrable functions over the real axis L2 (R), which forms the MRA.\nThe scaling functions \u03c6(r) and \u03c6\u0303(r) produce a biorthogonal MRA if they satisfy the following conditions.\n(i) Translates of these functions with integers \u03c6s = \u03c6(r \u2212 s), \u03c6\u0303s = \u03c6\u0303(r \u2212 s), s \u2208 Z, are linearly independent and\nproduce bases of the subspace V0 \u2282 L2 (R) and their dual counterpart \u1e7c0 \u2282 L2 (R) correspondingly. This means that\nif a function f (r) is contained in the space Vj , its integer translates have to be contained in the same space,\nf (r) \u2208 Vj \u21d4 f (r + s) \u2208 Vj ,\n\nf (r) \u2208 \u1e7cj \u21d4 f (r + s) \u2208 \u1e7cj ,\n\ns \u2208 Z.\n\n(ii) Dyadic dilates of these functions \u03c6js = \u03c6(2j r \u2212 s), \u03c6\u0303js = \u03c6\u0303(2j r \u2212 s), j \u2208 Z, generate hierarchical sets of\nsubspaces {Vj } and {\u1e7cj } , so that:\nVj \u2282 Vj+1 ,\n\u1e7cj \u2282 \u1e7cj+1 ,\n\n\u221e\n[\n\nj=\u2212\u221e\n\u221e\n[\n\n\u221e\n\\\n\n2\n\nVj is dense in L (R),\n\u1e7cj is dense in L2 (R),\n\nj=\u2212\u221e\n\u221e\n\\\n\nVj = 0,\n\n(9)\n\n\u1e7cj = 0.\n\nj=\u2212\u221e\n\nj=\u2212\u221e\n\n(iii) The sets of functions \u03c6js (r) and \u03c6\u0303js (r) are biorthogonal to each other. It means that for any s, s\u2032 \u2208 Z:\nZ\n\u03c6js (r)\u03c6\u0303js\u2032 (r) dr = \u03b4ss\u2032 .\nIt means that if a function f (r) is contained in the space Vj , the compressed function f (2r) has to be contained in\nthe higher resolution space Vj+1\nf (r) \u2208 Vj \u21d4 f (2r) \u2208 Vj+1 ,\n\nf (r) \u2208 \u1e7cj \u21d4 f (2r) \u2208 \u1e7cj+1 ,\n\nj \u2208 Z.\n\n(iv) There is a wavelet function \u03c8(r) and its dual wavelet function \u03c8\u0303(r) such that their integer translates \u03c8s (r) =\n\u03c8(r \u2212 s), \u03c8 \u0303s (r) = \u03c8\u0303(r \u2212 s), and dyadic dilates \u03c8js = \u03c8(2j r \u2212 s), \u03c8\u0303js = \u03c8\u0303(2j r \u2212 s), form subspaces Wj and W\u0303j which\nare complementary to Vj and V \u0303j so that:\nVj+1 = Vj \u2295 Wj ,\n\n\u1e7cj+1 = \u1e7cj \u2295 W\u0303j ,\n\nW\u0303j \u22a5Vj ,\n\n\u1e7cj \u22a5Wj .\n\n(10)\n\n(v) From the above relations it follows that L2 (R) can be decomposed into the approximation space Vj0 and the\nsum of the detailed spaces Wj of higher resolutions j > j0 :\nL2 (R) = Vj0 \u2295\n\n\u221e\nM\n\nWj ,\n\n(11)\n\nj\u2265j0\n\nwhere j0 \u2208 Z is a chosen level of resolution. This means that any square\u2013integrable function f (r) can be represented\nas a sum of linear combinations of the reconstruction scaling functions {\u03c6j0 } at a chosen resolution j = j0 and the\nreconstruction wavelet functions {\u03c8j } at all finer resolutions j \u2265 j0 . This can be written as,\nf (r) =\n\nX\ns\n\naj0 s \u03c6j0 s (r) +\n\n\u221e X\nX\n\nj>j0\n\ndjs \u03c8js (r),\n\n(12)\n\ns\n\nwhere the coefficients {aj0 s } and {djs } are obtained as the scalar products with the appropriate dual decomposition\nbasis functions,\nZ\nZ\najs = f (r)\u03c6\u0303js (r) dr, djs = f (r)\u03c8\u0303js (r) dr.\n(13)\n\n\f5\nThe later equation defines the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT).\nAs \u03c6(r) \u2282 V0 and V0 \u2282 V1 , \u03c6\u0303(r) \u2282 \u1e7c0 and \u1e7c0 \u2282 \u1e7c1 , we can express \u03c6(r) (as well as \u03c6\u0303(r)) as a linear combination\nof the basis functions in V1 (\u1e7c1 ):\nX\nX\nh\u0303s \u03c6\u0303(2r \u2212 s).\n(14)\n\u03c6(r) =\nhs \u03c6(2r \u2212 s),\n\u03c6\u0303(r) =\ns\n\ns\n\nThis equation is called the dilation equation. Similarly, \u03c8(r) and \u03c8\u0303(r) must satisfy a wavelet dilation equation:\nX\nX\n\u03c8(r) =\nws \u03c6(2r \u2212 s),\n\u03c8\u0303(r) =\nw\u0303s \u03c6\u0303(2r \u2212 s).\n(15)\ns\n\ns\n\nThe above sets of coefficients are usually called \"filters\" and they are completely sufficient in order to describe a chosen\nwavelet basis because there are several procedures on how to build up numerical values of the wavelet functions from the\nset of filters [7, 9, 15]. We should emphasize here that there are no analytic expressions for biorthogonal (orthogonal)\nwavelets with a finite support [40]. These are determined in terms of their filter coefficients only. But one can obtain\nthe values of these functions with any given accuracy by using special procedures, which are well described in the\nwavelet literature [7, 9, 15].\nThe scaling functions and the wavelets have a finite support only in the case of a finite number of the coefficients\nhs and ws . Due to their biorthogonal nature these functions satisfy the relations:\nZ\n\u03c6ja (r)\u03c6\u0303jb (r) dr = \u03b4ab ,\nZ\n\u03c6ja (r)\u03c8\u0303lb (r) dr = 0, (l \u2265 j),\n(16)\nZ\n\u03c6\u0303ja (r)\u03c8lb (r) dr = 0, (j \u2265 l),\nZ\n\u03c8ja (r)\u03c8\u0303kb (r) dr = \u03b4jk \u03b4ab ,\nfor any integer j, l, a, b.\nIf the pairs of the decomposition functions {\u03c6\u0303, \u03c8\u0303} and the reconstruction functions {\u03c6, \u03c8} are identical, the transform is called 'orthogonal wavelet transform.' Otherwise we shall talk about a more general 'biorthogonal wavelet\ntransform.'\nIn the expansion (12) the first term gives a 'coarse' approximation for f (r) at the resolution j0 and the second term\ngives a sequence of successive 'details'. In practice, we actually do not need to use the infinite number of resolutions.\nTherefore, the sequence of details is cut\u2013off at an appropriate resolution jmax . Since all functions used in numerical\nwork are given in a finite interval, the sequence of different translates {s} has also a finite number of terms S. It\nshould be mentioned that, really, S can be different for detailed and coarse approximations.\nImportantly, the explicit form of the basis functions is not required if we are using (bi)orthogonal wavelets with a\nfinite support and a dyadic set of scales j. Then the coefficients in Eq. (13) can be calculated by the Fast Wavelet\nTransform (FWT) algorithm [7, 8, 15]. The main idea of this algorithm is that a set of (bi)orthogonal discrete\nfilters at consequently dilated scales is used for the multi\u2013resolution analysis of a signal. As a result, to calculate the\napproximating coefficients, the convolution of the signal and the relevant filter is only required for each scale, and the\nlatter can be easily obtained.\nBy choosing relevant basis functions and scales we can nullify most of the coefficients {a} and {d} thereby reducing\nthe square root error (SRE) since DWT satisfies the Parseval's identity [9]. Therefore, the function under study can\nbe reconstructed with the use of only a few nonzero coefficients without any significant loss of accuracy, making the\ntotal number of the approximating coefficients rather small. This feature of the of wavelet approximation is widely\nused in processing of signals and images, the data for which should be compressed with minimal losses [10].\nE.\n\nChoice of wavelet basis set.\n\nThe compression and denoising properties of the wavelet transform strongly depended on the fundamental properties\nof the wavelet bases, which we define here in a rather simplified way as: the number of vanishing moments, regularity,\nsize of support, symmetry and orthogonality/biorthogonality.\n\n\f6\nNumber of vanishing moments: A wavelet function \u03c8(r) has Nv.m. vanishing moments if:\nZ\nr\u03bc \u03c8(r)dr = 0 for \u03bc = 0, . . . , Nv.m. \u2212 1,\n\n(17)\n\nThe number of vanishing moments strongly influences the localization of wavelets in the frequency space. The\nFourier transform of a wavelet with Nv.m. = n has a peak and decays as k \u2212n (k means frequency).\nRegularity: This can be defined as the number \u03c1 of existing derivatives of a wavelet function. It also characterizes\nthe frequency localization of wavelets. The Fourier transform of a wavelet with regularity \u03c1 = n decays as\nk \u2212(n+1) for large k. We would like to emphasize that as wavelets have no analytic expressions the definition of\ntheir derivatives is not as straightforward as for \"usual\" functions [9]. However, these mathematical details are\nbeyond of our article.\nSize of support: This is the length of the interval on which the wavelet function has non-zero values. Obviously,\nthis characterizes the space localization of the wavelet.\nSymmetry: The wavelet bases functions can be strongly symmetric or asymmetric. The deviation of a wavelet from\nthe symmetry (i.e. even or odd parity) is usually measured by how the phase of its Fourier transform deviates\nfrom a linear function. It was shown that is impossible to construct an orthogonal basis with the exact parity\nof the functions [41].\nOn the contrary, we can design a biorthogonal basis set with the exact symmetry of the function without serious\nefforts [9, 29].\nOrthogonality/Biorthogonality: As we have already mentioned in the case when the pairs of the decomposition\nfunctions {\u03c6\u0303, \u03c8\u0303} and the reconstruction functions {\u03c6, \u03c8} are identical, the wavelet transform is orthogonal.\nOtherwise it is biorthogonal. But this is true only if the {\u03c6\u0303, \u03c8\u0303} and {\u03c6, \u03c8} obey the conditions (16). We\nshould mention that there are several non-orthogonal families of wavelets such as Mexican Hat, Morle, Gaussian\nwavelets and so on [8, 9, 11]. Usually they have infinite support and do not obey exactly the Parseval's identity.\nTherefore such wavelets do not provide an one-to-one reconstruction of a function from the its wavelet expansion\ncoefficients. Due to these circumstances we do not use such basis sets in our work.\nSumming up the above, we can conclude that in order to provide good denoising of a signal the wavelets have\nto possess good regularity and as many vanishing moments as possible. From other point of view, they have to be\nwell localized in space, which means that they must have a quite short support. Unfortunately, these properties\nare interrelated. Thus, small support implies only few vanishing moments and poor regularity. In addition, the\northogonality implies asymmetry of the basis functions, which in turn can lead to some numerical artefacts. Since\nfor each concrete task certain wavelet properties are more important than others, there are different wavelet families\nwhich are optimized for some of these properties.\nFor example, in the case of Daubechies wavelets we have a maximum number of vanishing moments and maximal\nasymmetry with fixed length of support, while the Symlet wavelet family has the \"least asymmetry\" and highest\nnumber of vanishing moments with a given support width.\nIt was shown that it is possible to construct wavelet basis sets with the scaling function having vanishing moments\nof non\u2013zero order with respect to some shifting constant c. Thus, for a given number of vanishing moments Nv.m. we\nhave:\nZ\n(r \u2212 c)n \u03c6(r)dr = 0,\n0 < n < Nv.m. ,\nThe Coifman wavelets are compactly supported wavelets which have the highest number of vanishing moments for\nboth \u03c6(r) and \u03c8(r) with a given width of support. This property is very useful for the treatment of functions\nwith sharp peaks and slopes. The larger the number of the scaling function vanishing moments, the better is the\napproximation for singular points of the function under study [9]. Hence, by using such wavelets (e.g. Coifman)\nwe can treat accurately sharp peaks of such a function. On the other hand, these wavelets are rather smooth to\napproximate well the function within the ranges between these peaks. The price for this extra feature is that the\nCoifman wavelets are longer than the Daubechies wavelets. Their length of support is equal to 3Nv.m. \u2212 1 instead of\n2Nv.m \u2212 1.\nThus we can see that for orthogonal wavelets the desirable properties are in contradiction to each other. But\nfortunately, we can use different functions for the decomposition and reconstruction. These biorthogonal bases have\nseveral advantages compared with the orthogonal bases. We can also benefit from the fact that we can use base\n\n\f7\nfunctions \u03c6\u0303, \u03c8\u0303 with a number of vanishing moments for decomposition, whereas functions \u03c6, \u03c8 with a good regularity\nfor reconstruction. The former would separate any unpleasant stochastic oscillations of TPCFs leaving this 'noise'\nto the detail coefficients at higher levels of resolution. The latter, on the other hand, would produce a TPCF\napproximation as smooth as possible during reconstruction. If, however, we would prefer to impose both conditions\nof a large number of vanishing moments and regularity on an orthogonal basis, we would have to pay with a support\nat least twice the size that of the biorthogonal basis. Large supports, on the other hand, are known to lead to a\nsignificant deterioration in the quality of the wavelet approximation [9, 10].\nIn this work we will use biorthogonal bases from two biorthogonal families: Biorthogonal Spline Wavelets whose\ndecomposition functions \u03c8\u0303(r) are optimized for the number of vanishing moments, but the reconstruction functions\n\u03c8(r) are optimized in the sense of regularity; the Reverse Biorthogonal Spline Wavelet whose decomposition functions\n\u03c8\u0303(r) are optimized to achieve maximal regularity with a given support width and the reconstruction functions \u03c8(r)\nwhich are constructed in order to gain a maximum number of vanishing moments. In addition, these biorthogonal\nsets have the exact symmetry for all the basis functions.\nF.\n\nWavelet Algorithm\n\nA typical way of building the wavelet approximation is as follows [10]. The coefficients obtained by FWT are sorted\nin order of the decrease of their absolute values and then only some number L of the largest coefficients are kept by\nnullifying the rest of the coefficients. This is followed by application of the inverse transform (reconstruction). Note\nthat the truncation number L depends on the required accuracy of representation of the function in question. However,\nthis scheme is difficult to apply because of an undesired intersection between different levels of resolution which often\narises. The latter leads to a much increased number of coefficients required without any sensible improvement in\nthe accuracy. The quality of the resulting approximation is not particularly high because the numerical boundary\nartifacts result in the so\u2013called Gibbs effect, i.e. false oscillations of the approximated function [9].\nTherefore, we will use instead a 'smarter' strategy in which we employ the following three remarkable circumstances:\n(2)\n\n1. For physical reasons the functions \u011dij (r\u0302) vanish at r\u0302 \u2192 0 (due to the excluded volume effect) and at r\u0302 \u2192 \u221e\n(due to a finite size of the molecule).\n(2)\n\n2. In terms of the rescaled radius, r\u0302 & 0.75 the functions \u011dij (r\u0302) have a rapid exponential (or even a faster stretched\nexponential) decay.\n(2)\n\n3. From physical grounds it is also well known that \u011dij (r\u0302) is differentiable function of a high order for large r\u0302.\n4. The multi\u2013resolution nature of the wavelet analysis allows us to treat each level of the wavelet decomposition\nseparately.\nWe have developed an advanced scheme of the wavelet approximation which, first of all, takes into account the\npeculiarities of TPCF. From another side it relies on the strategy of a 'level-by-level' thresholding, which has been\nindependently proposed by several authors [10, 11].\nBy taking into account the asymptotic behavior of TPCFs, we can use the zero boundary conditions while doing\nthe wavelet decomposition. Considering the values of \u011d(r\u0302 \u2192 0) as zero, we can also nullify all wavelet coefficients\np\ncorresponding to the range [0, 0.05]. Strictly speaking, the upper bound for this cut\u2013off is given by r\u0302l \u2261 d/ Dij and\nit depends on the system size and parameters, but the value of 0.05 is well below this bound for all the data considered\nin this paper. As we have decomposition functions with a sufficient number of vanishing moments, we can nullify all\ndetail coefficients at all levels of resolution which correspond to the range of rescaled radius r\u0302 \u2208 [0.75, ..., \u221e) in order\nto extract the trends of our TPCF with a 'maximal smoothness' [9, 30]. The value for this lower bound r\u0302r has the\nmeaning of the rescaled radius after which TPCF has a fairly smooth decaying behavior. For other regions of r\u0302 we\nextract the highest detail coefficients in each levels of resolution separately.\nSumming up all of the above, we propose the following scheme for the TPCF wavelet approximation:\nP\n1. We\nP perform FWT with zero boundary conditions at the largest scale M satisfying the condition b |dM,b | \u2264\n\u01eb b |aM,b | (where a good choice for \u01eb is 0.05), then all further d-coefficients can be neglected.\n2. All the coefficients corresponding to the range r \u2208 [0, 0.05] (for both the approximation and the detail) are also\nnullified.\n3. We save all the approximation coefficients which remain non\u2013vanishing in the previous steps.\n\n\f8\n4. All the detail coefficients corresponding to r \u2208 [0.75, ..., \u221e) are nullified.\n5. In each level of decomposition we leave the maximal detail coefficients corresponding to the function extrema,\nwhile neglecting the rest of the coefficients.\n6. We perform the conventional inverse FWT but only for the non\u2013zero coefficients remaining from the previous\nsteps.\n7. To suppress the Gibbs effect at the left boundary, the approximated TPCF is set equal to zero up to rcross ,\nwhere rcross is the rightmost nontrivial zero point of the approximated TPCF, i.e., gapp (rcross ) = 0.\nAs a result, we have a fast scheme of calculations and a compact approximation for the correlation functions.\nConcerning the choice of the wavelet basis set, we note that to realize FWT there are many suitable sets such as\nDaubechies, Coifman, Symlets, biorthogonal wavelets, and so on [9, 29]. We have tested various basis sets, but our\ndetailed study presented below indicates that the reverse biorthogonal basis (RB5-5) is the best of them for treatment\nof TPCF for the systems under study. Here we shall follow the Daubechies' notation for this family: the first index\n- Nd = 5 for the decomposition functions, the second index - Nr = 5 for the reconstruction ones. These indices\nreflect the number of vanishing moments of \u03c8\u0303, namely: Nv.m. = Nr \u2212 1, the regularity value of \u03c8, namely \u03c1 = Nr \u2212 1,\nas well as the length of support l for the pairs {\u03c6\u0303, \u03c8\u0303}: ld = 2 \u2217 Nd + 1, and for the pairs {\u03c6, \u03c8}: lr = 2 \u2217 Nr + 1. Fig. 1\ndepicts the functions from the RB5-5 basis set.\nIII.\n\nRESULTS\n\nTo illustrate the usefulness of our scheme we have investigated the two\u2013point correlation functions of ring, linear and\nstar homopolymers in the coil state, as well as of the globular state of a ring homopolymer since the connectivity is not\n(2)\nas important for the latter state. The data for \u011dij (r\u0302) has been obtained by Monte Carlo simulations discussed in our\n(2)\n\nprevious study [28]. Fig. 2 depicts typical behavior of \u011dij (r\u0302) for an open homopolymer coil and a ring homopolymer\nglobule. As one can see, in the liquidpglobular state the TPCF has several peaks of increasing width and decreasing\nheight located at approximately n d/ Dij (n = 1, 2, . . .). On the other hand, the TPCF of a coil exhibits a smoother\nradial dependence, but suffers from a significant statistical noise.\nThe correlation functions obtained from such data are then approximated by the above described wavelet procedure.\nFig. 3 shows the difference \u2206\u011d(r\u0302) = \u011d(r\u0302) \u2212 \u011dapp (r\u0302) of the TPCFs obtained by simulations and their approximations\nby wavelets (solid curves) and cosines (dashed curves) with the same number of terms L. One can clearly see that the\nwavelet treatment provides a much better approximation than the cosines Fourier treatment. For the coil (L = 20),\nat small radial separations both treatments do show deviations from the simulation data, but these only reflect the\nlimitations of sampling statistics of TPCF as the function should really be very smooth and obey the des Cloizeaux\nequation. However, while the wavelet treatment gives an essentially vanishing \u2206\u011d for larger r\u0302, the Fourier treatment\ncontinues to yield parasitic oscillations at all separations. For the globule (L = 25), which had a much better quality\nof data due to a smaller entropy of the globule, the wavelet treatment gives an essentially vanishing \u2206\u011d everywhere,\nwhereas the Fourier method works very poorly in the whole range with strong oscillations present even for the largest\nof separations.\nIn Fig. 4 we present four different levels of the wavelet decomposition of TPCF of an open coil. We can see that the\nsmooth part of this function can be well represented by the approximation coefficients. Conversely, the unpleasant\noscillations are concentrated in the detail coefficients.\nIn Fig. 5 we likewise present four different levels of the wavelet decomposition of TPCF for the globule of a ring\nhomopolymer. We can see that the smooth part of this function can be mainly represented by the approximation\ncoefficients. But there is also an important information in the detail coefficients, which mainly represent the sharp\npeaks of the function. Therefore, our 'smart' level\u2013by\u2013level technique allows us to effectively suppress noise in case\nof the coil and to prevent us from 'oversmoothing' of physical oscillations in case of the globule.\nWe have alsopcalculated\nthe mean square norm of the inaccuracy \u2206, which characterizes the quality of the approxPn\n2\nimation: \u2206 \u2261\ni=1 (\u011d(r\u0302i ) \u2212 \u011dapp (r\u0302i )) , where r\u0302i = i * \u03b4r\u0302 are the grid points, \u011d(r\u0302i ) is the 'true' correlation function\nfrom Monte Carlo data, and \u011dapp (r\u0302i ) is the approximated one. Figs. 6 and 7 depict the dependences of the norm \u2206\non the number L of the approximating coefficients for the coil and globule states respectively. In what was mentioned\nabove we have used the 'RB5-5' basis set [9]. Here, for comparison we also depict these dependencies for the Cosine\nand FFT approximation, which are widely used in applications [31]. We can see that for a reasonable number of\ncoefficients the wavelet approximations gives us a remarkably better accuracy than the conventional methods.\nFor the approximated TPCF we have also evaluated the scaling exponents for the coil state. In this case we can\ncompare these results with the rather accurate theoretical values obtained from the Borel resumed renormalisation\n\n\f9\ngroup calculations [1, 3, 23, 32]. As in Ref. [28] the fitting has been done via the the nonlinear least\u2013squares (NLLS)\nMarquardt\u2013Levenberg method [34] by means of the fit function in the gnuplot software. Fit reports parameter\nerror estimates which are obtained from the variance\u2013covariance matrix after the final iteration. By convention, these\nestimates are called 'standard errors' and they have been reported in Tab. I, which contains the results for open and\nring homopolymers. Here we have used the wavelet approximation with L = 20 coefficients. In this table we also\ninclude the results which are obtained from the fitting of the untreated functions as in Ref. [28]. The notations in the\nfirst column follow the des Cloizeaux convention: 0 - end\u2013end monomers, 1 - end\u2013middle, 1' - end\u2013three quarters,\n1\" - end\u2013one quarter, and 2 - one quarter\u2013three quarters of the chain respectively. Here and below reported errors\nare those from the fitting procedure only and do not necessarily account for statistical and other simulation errors.\nWe can see that the wavelet approximated functions agree with the most recent theoretical values much better.\nNote also that some of the theoretical values in this table have been updated thanks to the more accurate values\nfrom Refs. [3, 23, 32] as compared to those which we have used in Ref. [28]. Moreover, we do not even need to\nfreeze \u03b4 at the theoretical value in order to extract a more accurate estimate for \u03b8 as we had to do previously. These\nimprovements in the results of our fitting are not surprising given that, as we have mentioned earlier, the coefficients\ncut\u2013off leads to an effective noise suppressing.\nThe least\u2013squares fitting of the data {x, y} with a model function y(xi ; a), which depends on the fitting parameters\na in a nonlinear fashion, in the multi\u2013variate case is a complex problem [34] akin to that of finding the global minimum\nPN\nof the merit function \u03c72 (a) = i=1 \u03c3i\u22122 (yi \u2212 y(xi ; a))2 with respect to N parameters a, where \u03c3i is the standard\ndeviation (error) of the i-th data point. If the data is fairly noisy, the problem of finding the global minimum of \u03c72\nbecomes complicated as there are many low\u2013lying local minima of this function and its constant value surfaces have\na complicated topology. The Marquardt\u2013Levenberg method is one of the most popular fitting algorithms which is an\nefficient hybrid of the inverse\u2013Hessian (variable metric) and the steepest descent (conjugated gradients) minimization\nalgorithms for \u03c72 [34]. Practically, the iterations need to be stopped after the values of \u03c72 change less than the\nspecified precision and, clearly, the resulting fitted values af it may depend on the choice of the initial values a0\nif there are many local minima present, as well as on the weights \u03c3. It is not uncommon to find the parameters\nwandering around near the global minimum in a flat valley of complicated topology if the input data was fairly noisy\n[34]. The wavelet treatment renders the initial poorly\u2013defined fitting problem into a well\u2013defined one (which becomes\nessentially independent of the initial parameters choice) by removing the high\u2013pitch statistical noise from the data,\nand thus by simplifying the topology of the constant \u03c72 surfaces and getting rid of its many artificial local minima.\nAt the same time, the variances (squared standard errors) of the fitted parameters and the co-variances between them\nbecome smaller than for the untreated data as we are now guaranteed to have found the true \u03c72 global minimum.\nTab. II lists similar exponents for star homopolymers with the number of arms f = 12 in a good solvent. Here we\nhave used the wavelet approximation with L = 30 coefficients. We then have compared the results with those from\nthe analytical renormalisation group calculations in the so\u2013called 'cone' approximation for \u03b8 from Ref. [33]. This\ncomparison has not been previously made in Ref. [28] or elsewhere so far, to the best of our knowledge. The agreement\nbetween the Monte Carlo and theoretical values seems quite reasonable despite the relatively short length of the arms\nand the limitations of the 'cone' approximation. The latter produces the contact exponents only dependent on the\nfunctionalities fi , fj of the two monomers in question and not on any other parameters of the star, namely\n\u03b8fi ,fj \u2243\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n5\n1\n3/2\n/3/2\n\u221a\n.\n\u2212 fj\n(fi + fj )3/2 \u2212 fi\n36 2 \u2212 1\n\n(18)\n\nAs one can see, the quality of the wavelet approximation is rather good for the combined scheme, while the number\nof approximating coefficients is quite small.\nIn general, the accuracy of the wavelet approximations with a fixed number of reconstruction coefficients depends\non the chosen basis set. So far, no exact 'recipe' was given on which base we have to use in a concrete case. Thus,\nwe have checked our assumption about one of the dual bases 'RB5-5' by an additional study. As we are especially\ninterested in the quality of the scaling exponent calculations we have evaluated the scaling exponent for an open\nhomopolymer coil with the use of different bases. These results are presented in Tab. III. We have used the wavelet\napproximations of the end\u2013end TPCFs with the same number of coefficients. We chose for this comparison typical\nrepresentatives of the main wavelet families: Coifman 2, Daubechies 4, Symlet 4, Biorthogonal 5-5 and Discrete Meyer\nwavelets [9].\nWe can see that the 'Reverse Biorthogonal 5-5' basis set does the approximation better than the other bases. On the\nother hand, other bases, apart from the Discrete Meyer's, also reveal good fitting results compared to the untreated\nTPCF. This means that our current scheme is just one of possible successful choices of the basis set. The situation\nwith the Discrete Meyer is easily explained by a too large support length of this basis l = 60 as compared with l = 11\nfor 'RB5-5', which is known to lead to strong over\u2013smoothing [9].\n\n\f10\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nOur present study indicates that the discrete wavelets is a suitable and powerful instrument for approximating\nthe intra\u2013chain two\u2013point correlation functions (TPCF) of different homopolymers in dilute solutions. The wavelet\ntechnique allows us to extract the scaling properties from fairly noisy data more accurately and reliably than it can be\ndone by the direct fitting. The wavelet treatment removes the high\u2013pitch stochastic fluctuations (part of 'statistical\nnoise') in the data thereby producing a somewhat 'coarse\u2013grained' approximation of the data. This renders the illdefined multi\u2013variate nonlinear fitting procedure of the untreated data into a well\u2013defined uniquely convergent fitting\nprocedure after the wavelet treatment of the data. Naturally, this also reduces the standard deviations of the fitted\nparameters. However, the wavelet treatment does not over\u2013smooth the data by retaining the genuine oscillations as\nwe clearly see in the case of the globule, nor does it produce any of the unpleasant artefacts of the truncated Fourier\napproximation.\nWe can see that the dual basis set performs particularly well for approximating TPCFs. This is related to the basis\nproperties, namely, that the decomposition functions have a maximal number of vanishing moments with a finite\nsupport, whereas the reconstruction functions are as regular as possible with a given length of support. Moreover,\nthe proposed scheme is rather flexible as it is based on the conventional FWT algorithm. One can choose the basis\nset and adjust the number of the coefficients easily for a particular problem. From the results in Tab. III we can also\nconclude that by using almost any reasonable basis it is possible to obtain an improvement in the fitting procedure.\nIt should be emphasized that the wavelet scheme is rather universal. The scheme of the wavelet approximation\nproposed here allows us to represent the correlation functions with a small number of approximating coefficients not\nonly for the coil but also for globular state of the homopolymers. For instance, our procedure yields the relative\naccuracy of the approximation of order n1 \u2206 \u223c 0.5 * 10\u22123 . Such accurate knowledge of TPCFs can be used for an input\nto the self\u2013consistent calculations of the inter\u2013chain distribution functions in the framework of the density functional\nmethods [35, 36, 37] and others.\nDue to a compact parameterization and a high accuracy of the approximation by wavelets, we hope that the\nwavelets can be applied not only for approximating the inter\u2013chain distribution functions of polymers, but also\nin order to calculate these functions by the integral equations theory of polymers [38]. The success of the recent\napplications of wavelets to the theory of molecular solutes [4] has indicated that the method is capable of calculating\nthe thermodynamic characteristics of solvation rather accurately.\nWe believe that further progress in this direction can also be of importance for the novel theories for calculating the\nintra\u2013chain TPCFs of polymers directly from a force field. Some of us are presently working on the Super\u2013Gaussian\nSelf\u2013Consistent (SGSC) theory for a single macromolecule with any two\u2013body Hamiltonian, in which a set of integro\u2013\ndifferential equations is derived for \u011dij (r\u0302) as well as for Dij . In order to reduce the computational expenses in such\ncalculations, having a compact and multi\u2013resolution accurate representation for \u011dij (r\u0302) is essential.\nFinally, due to the very general nature of the wavelet theory, we hope that wavelets can find other numerous\napplications for describing spatial and temporal dependences of various observables in a number of fields of soft\ncondensed matter theory which they have not hereto beneficially influenced.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank Professor L.
