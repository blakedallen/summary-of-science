T HE AMS-02\n\nEXPERIMENT\n\nThe Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS)[1], whose final\nversion AMS-02 is to be installed on the International Space\nStation (ISS) for at least 3 years, is a detector designed to study\nthe cosmic ray flux by direct detection of particles above the\nEarth's atmosphere using state-of-the-art particle identification\ntechniques. AMS-02 is equipped with a superconducting magnet cooled by superfluid helium. The spectrometer is composed of several subdetectors: a Transition Radiation Detector\n(TRD), a Time-of-Flight (TOF) detector, a Silicon Tracker,\nAnticoincidence Counters (ACC), a Ring Imaging \u010cerenkov\n(RICH) detector and an Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL).\nFig. 1 shows a schematic view of the full AMS-02 detector. A\npreliminary version of the detector, AMS-01, was successfully\nflown aboard the US space shuttle Discovery in June 1998[2].\nThe main goals of the AMS-02 experiment are:\n\u2022 A precise measurement of charged cosmic ray spectra\nin the rigidity region between \u223c 0.5 GV and \u223c 2 TV,\nand the detection of photons with energies up to a few\nhundred GeV;\n\u2022 A search for heavy antinuclei (Z \u2265 2), which if discovered would signal the existence of cosmological antimatter;\n\nFig. 1.\n\nExploded view of the AMS-02 detector.\n\nA search for dark matter constituents by examining\npossible signatures of their presence in the cosmic ray\nspectrum.\nThe long exposure time and large acceptance (0.5 m2 *sr) of\nAMS-02 will enable it to collect an unprecedented statistics\nof more than 1010 nuclei.\n\u2022\n\nII. T HE AMS RICH\n\nDETECTOR\n\nOne of the subdetectors in AMS-02 is a proximity focusing\nRing Imaging \u010cerenkov (RICH) detector. It is composed of\n\n\fa dual radiator with silica aerogel (n = 1.050) and sodium\nfluoride (n = 1.334), a high reflectivity lateral conical mirror\nand a detection matrix with 680 photomultipliers coupled to\nlight guides.\nRun\n\n1456 Event\n\n702\n\nFig. 3.\nLIP.\n\nFig. 2.\n\nA simulated proton event as seen in the AMS-02 display.\n\nThe RICH detector will provide a very accurate velocity\nmeasurement (in aerogel, \u2206\u03b2/\u03b2 \u223c 10\u22123 and 10\u22124 for Z = 1\nand Z = 10 \u2212 20, respectively) and charge identification of\nnuclei up to iron (Z = 26).\nRICH data, combined with information on particle rigidity\nfrom the AMS Silicon Tracker, enable the reconstruction of\nparticle mass. A typical RICH event is shown in Figs. 2 and\n3, where the latter gives a detailed view of the readout matrix.\nThe accuracy of the RICH velocity measurement is essential\ndue to the growth of relative errors when v \u2192 c:\n\u2206m\n\u2206p\n\u2206\u03b2\n=\n\u2295 \u03b32\nm\np\n\u03b2\nThe assembly of the AMS RICH detector is currently\nunderway at CIEMAT in Madrid. The integration of the RICH\nand the other subdetectors of AMS-02 will take place at CERN\nin 2007.\nThe analysis of RICH data involves the identification of the\n\u010cerenkov ring in a hit pattern which usually includes several\nscattered noise hits and an eventual strong spot in the region\nwhere the charged particle crosses the detection plane. Two\nindependent algorithms for velocity and charge reconstruction\nhave been developed in the AMS collaboration for the analysis\nof RICH events: a geometrical method based on a hit-by-hit\nreconstruction[3], and a method using all the hits with the\nmaximization of a likelihood function[4]).\nA prototype of the RICH detector, consisting of 96 photomultiplier units, was tested both with cosmic ray particles and\nwith beam ions at the CERN SPS in 2002 and 2003. A piece of\n\nThe same event of Fig. 2 as seen in the RICH display developed at\n\nthe conical reflector was included in the beam test setup[5].\nThe algorithms for velocity and charge reconstruction were\nsuccessfully applied to data from these prototype tests[6].\nIII. C OMPONENTS\n\nOF THE COSMIC RAY SPECTRUM\n\nProtons are the most abundant component (\u223c 90%) of\ncharged cosmic rays reaching the Earth's vicinity. The remaining fraction is essentially made of atomic nuclei (mostly 4 He)\nand single-charged particles such as e\u2212 , e+ and p\u0304.\nPrecise measurements of the smaller components in the\ncosmic ray spectrum are essential in the context of the study\nof cosmic-ray production and acceleration. The required precision can only be attained through very effective charge and\nmass discrimination methods since the abundances of different\ncomponents differ by several orders of magnitude.\nRatios such as D/p, 3 He/4 He and B/C give information on\nthe interstellar medium since all compare the abundances of\nsecondary and primary species. The beryllium isotope ratio\n10\nBe/9 Be is a probe for galactic confinement times since both\nisotopes are secondary but one of them, 10 Be, is unstable\n(t1/2 = 1.5 \u00d7 106 yr).\nThe lightest neutralino (\u03c7\u030301 ), predicted by supersymmetric\nmodels, is a strong dark matter candidate. If it exists and\naccounts for the known dark matter density (\u03a9CDM \u2243 \u03a9m \u2212\n\u03a9b \u2243 0.2) or at least for a significant part of it, neutralino\nannihilation (\u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 ...) must take place and contribute to\nthe observed cosmic ray composition, with the more visible\neffects occurring in the spectra of antiparticles like e+ , p\u0304\nand especially D\u0304[7]. Fig. 4 shows a comparison between the\nexpected D\u0304 fluxes from secondary production and from dark\nmatter annihilation.\n\n\f10\n\n10-1\n\n10-3\n\n10-5\n10-6 -1\n10\n\nFig. 5.\n\nIDENTIFICATION\n\nTo evaluate the capabilities of AMS-02 for mass separation\nof deuterons and antideuterons from other particles with the\nsame charge, studies have been performed using the case of\ndeuteron vs. proton separation. In the past, studies on the\nseparation of helium (Z = 2) and beryllium (Z = 4) isotopes\nhave also been performed using a standalone simulation of the\nRICH detector[8]. In the present case the large difference between proton and deuteron abundances (D/p \u223c 1%) increases\nthe importance of a very effective mass separation to isolate\nthe deuteron signal from a large background of proton events.\nIn the study of D/p separation a full-scale simulation of the\nAMS detector was used. Particles were simulated as coming\nfrom the top plane of a cube, corresponding to an acceptance\nof 47.78 m2 *sr. Three data samples were chosen. Table I shows\nthe momentum ranges and number of events simulated in each\nsample.\nTABLE I\nS AMPLES USED IN THE D/p SEPARATION STUDIES\nSample\np (low momentum)\np (high momentum)\nD\n\nMomentum range\n0.5 \u2212 10 GeV/c\n10 \u2212 200 GeV/c\n0.5 \u2212 20 GeV/c\n\nNo. events\n3.1 \u00d7 108\n1.3 \u00d7 108\n5.6 \u00d7 107\n\ndN\nFor each sample, d(ln\np) = constant.

[9].\nIn each event a set of preliminary data selection cuts using\nreadings from different subdetectors of AMS-02 was applied\nto reduce the fraction of events with a bad reconstruction. Only\ndowngoing events (\u03b2 > 0) were accepted. In addition, events\nwere accepted if the following conditions were satisfied:\n\u2022 Only one particle was detected in the event;\n\u2022 A particle track was reconstructed by the Silicon Tracker;\n\u2022 No clusters were found in the Anti-Coincidence Counters;\n\u2022 Clusters from at least 3 TOF planes (out of 4) were used\nfor event reconstruction;\n\u2022 At most one additional cluster was allowed in the TOF;\n\u2022 At least 6 Tracker layers (out of 8) were used in the track\nreconstruction;\n\u2022 Compatibility was required for the rigidity measurements obtained from two different algorithms, with\n\u2206R/R < 3%;\n\u2022 Compatibility was also required for the rigidity measurements obtained from each half of the Tracker (upper and\nlower), with \u2206R/R < 50%;\n\u2022 The particle's impact point on the RICH radiator was less\nthan 58 cm from the centre (i. e. more than 2 cm from\nthe mirror);\n\u2022 At most one track was present in the TRD;\n\u2022 The TOF and Tracker charge reconstructions were compatible.\nAmong the events that triggered the detector, a fraction\ncorresponding to \u223c 15-20% of proton events and \u223c 10-15%\nof deuteron events in the relevant region of kinetic energy (few\nGeV/nucleon) passed this set of preliminary cuts, corresponding to an acceptance of \u223c 0.3 m2 *sr for protons and \u223c 0.2\nm2 *sr for deuterons.\nThe reconstruction of particle masses was then performed\nfor events having a signal in the RICH detector. The extremely accurate velocity measurement provided by the RICH\n(\u2206\u03b2/\u03b2 \u223c 10\u22123 in the case of protons and deuterons) is crucial\nto reduce the background level.

A NALYSIS\n\nRESULTS\n\nResults show that mass separation of particles with Z = 1\nis feasible even if one species is orders of magnitude more\nabundant than the other. D/p separation is possible up to\nEkin \u223c 8 GeV/nucleon. Some examples of the mass distributions obtained are shown in Figs. 6 and 7. Solid lines show\nthe mass distributions before the RICH cuts were taken into\nconsideration.\nFig. 8 shows the expected sensitivity of AMS for the D/p\nratio after one day of data taking. Results show that a single\nday of AMS-02 statistics will be sufficient to improve on the\nexisting data for this ratio.\n\n\facceptance (m2 sr)\n\nProton acceptance\n\n1\n\n10-1\n\nACCEPTANCE\nLVL1 trigger\nall pre-cuts\nall RICH cuts\n\n10-2\n\n10-3\n10-1\n\n1\n\n10\nsimulated Ekin (GeV/nucleon)\n\n1\n\n10\nsimulated Ekin (GeV/nucleon)\n\nDeuteron acceptance\nacceptance (m2 sr)\n\nIn the optimal region immediately above the aerogel radiation threshold (Ekin < 5 GeV/nucleon) rejection factors\nhigher than 104 region were attained (Fig. 9). The best relative\nmass resolutions for protons (Fig. 10) and deuterons are\n\u223c 2% for both radiators in the regions above their respective\nthresholds.\nAfter all cuts, an acceptance of \u223c 0.07 m2 *sr was obtained for protons, and \u223c 0.05 m2 *sr for deuterons at\nEkin > 3 GeV/nucleon (Fig. 11). The increase by a factor\n\u223c 10 in the acceptance above the aerogel threshold reflects the\nrelative dimensions of the two radiators in the RICH detector.\nThe main background in the deuteron case comes from nongaussian tails of proton events with a bad velocity reconstruction. Errors in rigidity reconstruction (\u2206R/R \u223c 2% in the\nGeV region) are not critical for this case.\nThe specific set of cuts shown here corresponds to an example of a selection procedure. Other variations are possible.\nIn particular, rejection factors may be improved by applying\nstricter cuts, at the expense of a further acceptance reduction.\n\n1\n\n10-1\n\nACCEPTANCE\nLVL1 trigger\nall pre-cuts\nall RICH cuts\n\nRejection factor, aerogel\n\n10-2\n\nRejection factor\n\n105\n10-3\n\n104\n\n10-1\n\n103\n\nFig. 11.

Detailed\nsimulations have been performed to evaluate the detector's\nparticle identification capabilities, in particular those of the\nRICH. Simulation results show that the separation of light\nisotopes is feasible. Using a set of simple cuts based on\nevent data, relative mass resolutions of \u223c 2 % and rejection\nfactors higher than 104 have been attained in D/p separation\nat energies of a few GeV/nucleon. The separation procedure\npresented here might be crucial for the identification of an\nantideuteron flux resulting from neutralino annihilation.\nR EFERENCES\n\n1\n\n10\nEkin (GeV/nucleon)\n\nFig. 10.
