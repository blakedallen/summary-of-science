I. Katz (2002)). Although no two GRBs resemble\neach other and each one has its own peculiarities which makes the problem of modeling\n1\n\ne-mail: fmomeni@mehr.sharif.edu\n\n2\n\ne-mail: samimi@sharif.edu\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nGRBs very difficult, the whole of GRBs reveals several interesting features. Since the publication of the BATSE data (Fishman et al. 1993) which included the observation of over\n200 GRBs and revealed an almost uniform distribution of the location of GRBs in the\nsky, combined with the deficiency of faint GRBs, the association of GRBs with the galactic plane has been ruled out. The successive publications confirmed the figure more and\nmore (Meegan et al. 1996; Paciesas et al. 1999). However, since the observation of afterglows in X-ray (Costa et al. 1997), optical (van Paradijs et al. 1997) and radio spectrum\n(Frail et al. 1997) and the advert of Robotic Optical Transient Search Experiment (ROTSIE) telescope (Akerlof et al. 2003; Gisler et al. 1999, e.g.) which has revealed the red shifts\nfor several GRBs, their cosmological origin is widely accepted.\nThe BATSE data (Fishman et al. 1993; Meegan et al. 1996; Paciesas et al. 1999) has also\nrevealed another equally important overall feature of the GRBs. The distribution of time\nduration in observed GRBs shows a double heap distribution, which the smaller one peaks\naround 0.2 sec and the larger one peaks around 20 sec (Fig.1). This two peaked distribution\nwhich apparently separated GRBs into the so called short duration and long duration ones\nwas referred to as bimodality (Kouveliotou et al. 1993; Norris et al. 1993) and led some investigators to believe that there are two distinct populations of GRBs.\nIt has been widely believed that whatever the central engine is, the radiation reaching us\noriginates from the space surrounding the central engine. It is also believed that during the\ncollapse the energy release streams out in relativistic confined ejectas (not isotropically) and\nthus the total energy release during each event is far less than the unbelievable amount that\none might obtain by assuming isotropic radiation (Kulkarni et al. 1999).\nThe aim of this paper is to present a rather simple model, based on these general ideas, and\nshow that there is no need for assuming two distinct populations of GRBs, and to show that\nonce the geometrical considerations and cosmological effects are fully accounted for a genetic\nstandard candle ejecta, crossing an amorphous dense cloud, the so called bimodality can be\ndeduced.\nIn \u00a7 2 the model and its general formulation is introduced. In \u00a7 3 the computational results\nand the fit of model parameters with BATSE data will be presented as well. \u00a7 4 is devoted\nto a discussion on the results. Some needed calculations and discussions are presented in\nappendices.\n\n2.\n\nTHE MODEL FORMULATION\n\nGRBs are modeled as a central engine with an instantaneous ultra-relativistic jet of\nmaterial surrounded by an amorphous dense cloud. The central engine and its jet are taken\nas a standard candle with a total release energy of E, and an initial Lorentz factor \u03930 and\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\ninitial opening angle \u03b60 of the jet for all GRBs, whereas the clouds are considered to have a\ndistribution both in thickness as well as in density. For the sake of illustration and brevity\nwe take both of these distributions to be Gaussian.\nWe want to calculate the distribution of logarithm of time duration of observed GRBs according to the above model. We should however explore the ejecta evolution since the observed\ngamma ray emission originates in the shock front of ejecta+shocked medium.\n\n2.1.\n\nThe Ejecta Evoution\n\nThe equations describing the ejecta evolution are presented here, based on the notations\nof Paczynski & Rhoads (1993). We consider the cloud to be at a distance r0 from the source,\nwhich may be negligible in comparison to the cloud thickness L. The ratio of swept-up mass\nto ejecta mass M0 has the form below:\nZ r\n1\nf=\n\u03c1\u03a9m (r \u2032 )r \u20322 dr \u2032,\n(1)\nM0 r0\nwhere, r is the ejecta distance from the source. The cloud density \u03c1 is taken to be independent\nof r. Furthermore, \u03a9m (r) = 2\u03c0[1 \u2212 cos \u03b6(r)], in which \u03b6(r) represents the opening angle of\nthe ejecta at radius r. So, equation(1) can be written as:\nmp \u03930 c2\ndf\n= 2\u03c0n\n[1 \u2212 cos \u03b6(r)]r 2,\ndr\nE\n\n(2)\n\nwhere E and \u03930 are the initial kinetic Energy and initial Lorentz factor of the ejecta (E =\n\u03930 M0 c2 ), and n denotes the number density of the cloud (\u03c1 = mp n). Paczynski & Rhoads\n(1993) derived the relation between f and \u0393 from conservation of energy and momentum.\nHere, we use their relation in a form suitable for our computations:\np\ndf\n\u039320 \u2212 1\n\u221a\n=\u2212 3\n.\n(3)\nd\u0393\n\u03932 \u2212 1\nThe ejecta's opening angle \u03b6(r) increases with increasing r as a result of lateral spreading\nof the cloud of ejecta+swept-up matter in the comoving frame at the sound speed cs , which\nhas been derived by Rhoads (1998) to be as below:\n\ncs dtco\n,\n(4)\nr\nwhere tco denotes the time from the event, measured in the ejecta comoving frame. Substituting dtco = dt/\u0393, and dt = dr/\u03b2c, we have :\nd\u03b6(r) =\n\nd\u03b6(r)\ncs /c\n=\n.\ndr\n\u03b2\u0393r\n\n(5)\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nNow, eliminating f between equations(2) and (3) yields:\n\u221a\n3\nd\u0393\n\u03932 \u2212 1 2\nmp \u03930 c2\nr .\n= \u22122\u03c0n\n[1 \u2212 cos \u03b6(r)] p\ndr\nE\n\u039320 \u2212 1\n\n(6)\n\nLet's rewrite equations(5) and (6) in a non-dimensional form as below:\n\uf8f1\ncs /c\nd\u03b6\n\uf8f2 d\u03b7\n= \u03b7\u0393(\u03b7)(1\u2212\n1 \u22121/2\n)\n\u03932\n\u221a\n3 2\n,\n\u0393\u221a\nd\u0393\n0 \u0393 \u22121\n\uf8f3 d\u03b7 = \u2212\n[1 \u2212 cos \u03b6(\u03b7)]\u03b7 2\n2\n\n(7)\n\n\u03930 \u22121\n\nwhere, the non-dimensional parameter \u03b7 is defined as:\n\u03b7\u2261\nin which:\nl(n/E) \u2261\n\n\u0012\n\n2\u03c0mp c2 n\nE\n\n\u0013\u22121/3\n\nr\n,\nl(n/E)\n\n(8)\n\n= 4.75 \u00d7 10\n\n11\n\n\u0012\n\nn18\nE48\n\n\u0013\u22121/3\n\ncm .\n\n(9)\n\nThese coupled first order differential equations can be solved numerically by introducing the\ninitial conditions:\n\u001a\n\u0393(\u03b70 ) = \u03930\n,\n(10)\n\u03b6(\u03b70) = \u03b60\nwhere \u03b70 \u2261 r0 /l(n/E).\nNoting that \u03b2 = dr/cdt = (1 \u2212 1/\u03932 )1/2 , we have:\nd\u03c4\n=\nd\u03b7\n\n\u0012\n1\u2212\n\n1\n2\n\u0393 (\u03b7)\n\n\u0013\u22121/2\n\n;\n\n\u03c4 (\u03b70 ) = 0.\n\n(11)\n\nIn equation(11) we used equation(8) and a non-dimensional time parameter \u03c4 defined as:\n\u03c4\u2261\n\nct\nl(n/E)\n\n(12)\n\nThe numerical results of equation(11) are used in appendix C, where we consider the effect\nof burster geometry on the observable time duration.\n\n2.2.\n\nFormulation of Time Duration Distribution\n\nWe begin with introducing the probability density for a collimated burst to occur in\na direction through the cloud with a thickness L and a number density n. We assume the\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\ncloud thickness to have a gaussian distribution in various directions from the central engine.\nBy assuming a gaussian distribution for the cloud density as well we have:\n\u0015\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0014\nd3 p\n1\n1\n1\n\u2212(L \u2212 L)2\n\u2212(n \u2212 n)2\n\u221a\n\u221a\n.\n(13)\n=\nexp\nexp\ndn dL d\u03a9\n4\u03c0 2\u03c0\u03c3n\n2\u03c3n2\n2\u03c3L2\n2\u03c0\u03c3L\nThe quantities L and \u03c3L denote the mean thickness of the cloud and its dispersion, respectively. Likewise, n and \u03c3n are defined in a similar manner. Denoting the angle between the\nejecta symmetry axis and the line of sight by \u03b8 (Fig.2), and considering the independence of\nthe probability density from azimuth angle in equation(13), we can write:\n\u0015\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0014\n2\u03c0 sin \u03b8 1\n1\nd3 p\n\u2212(L \u2212 L)2\n\u2212(n \u2212 n)2\n\u221a\n\u221a\n.\n(14)\n=\nexp\nexp\ndn dL d\u03b8\n4\u03c0\n2\u03c3n2\n2\u03c3L2\n2\u03c0\u03c3n\n2\u03c0\u03c3L\nThe synchrotron emission is a fast process for our model (see appendix A), so Trec (the time\nduration of a GRB as measured by an observer cosmologicaly near to the source and located\non the line of sight), is attributed to the time that the shock front takes to cross the dense\ncloud. As explained in appendix C, the cloud thickness L can be expressed as a function of\n\u03b8, n, and Trec (Eqn.[C16]):\nL = L(Trec , n, \u03b8) .\n(15)\nSo we write:\n\nor:\n\nd2\ndn d\u03b8\n\n\u0012\n\ndp\ndL\n\n\u0013\n\nd2\n=\ndn d\u03b8\n\n\u0012\n\ndp\ndTrec\n\nd3 p\nd3 p\n=\ndn d\u03b8 d log Trec\ndn d\u03b8 dL\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\nn,\u03b8\n\n\u0012\n\ndTrec\ndL\n\ndL\nd log Trec\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(16)\n\nn,\u03b8\n\n,\n\n(17)\n\nn,\u03b8\n\nnotifying that by this substitution(Eqn.[15]), the bursts that do not manage to cross through\nthe cloud with a thickness L (and stop in it) are practically omitted (see appendix C).

Equation(19) only gives the probability density\nfor an observed burst to have a specified logarithm of time duration, as measured by an\nobserver near to it. We now investigate the relation between dp/d log Trec and dp/d log T\u2295\nwhere T\u2295 stands for the time duration of a GRB measured at Earth. To obtain the later,\nthe former must be integrated over red shift z, using a weight function FGRB (z), so that\nFGRB (z) dz represents the probability for occurring a GRB in a red shift between z and\nz + dz. To show this, let's consider an observer located on the line from us to an occurred\nGRB which is (cosmologicaly) near to it. The probability density for the GRB to occur in\na red shift z (with respect to us), and to have a specific log Trec (measured by the observer\nnear to the GRB), is clearly as below:\nd2 p\ndp\n= FGRB (z)\n.\ndz d log Trec\nd log Trec\n\n(20)\n\nTo obtain d2 p/dz d log T\u2295 , which is the probability density for observing a GRB occurred at\na red shift z and observed to have a specific T\u2295 , we write:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\u0015\nd\ndp\nd\ndp\nd log Trec\nd2 p\n=\n=\n,\n(21)\ndz d log T\u2295\ndz d log T\u2295 z dz\nd log Trec z d log T\u2295 z\nnoting that T\u2295 = (1 + z)Trec , the second term in the the bracket equals one. Now, using\nequation(20) we have :\n!\nd2 p\ndp\n,\n(22)\n= FGRB (z)\ndz d log T\u2295\nd log Trec Trec =T\u2295 /(1+z)\nAfter integrating equation(22) over z, the final form of the observable probability density\nwill be as below:\n!\nZ \u221e\ndp\ndp\ndz .\n(23)\n=\nFGRB (z)\nd log T\u2295\nd log Trec Trec =T\u2295 /(1+z)\nz=0\nThe explicit form of FGRB (z) is needed. This form is obtained in appendix D (Eqn.[D4] and\nEqn.[D5]). The second term in the integrand is given by equation(19), in which the implicit\nform of L(Trec , n, \u03b8) appears. Appendix C is devoted to the procedure of obtaining this\nfunction. For evaluation of dp/d log T\u2295 (Eqn.[23]), we need the values of eight parameters.\nFour of them are the cloud parameters L, \u03c3L , n, and \u03c3n , and the fifth one is the index q\ncorresponding to the GRB occurrence rate (see Eqn.[D5]). The later three ones are the ejecta\nparameters, E, \u03930 , and \u03b60 , which are the initial kinetic energy, the initial Lorentz factor, and\nthe initial opening angle of the ejecta, respectively.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n3.\n\nNUMERICAL COMPUTATIONS AND RESULTS\n\nThe Mathmatica 4 software is used in the numerical computations. In the procedure\nwe begin with solving the coupled differential equations(7) and (11) which govern the ejecta\nevolution, and in which \u03930 and \u03b60 are the only free parameters. Furthermore, we take\n\u03b70 = 0. For fixed values of these parameters, the functions \u0393(\u03b7), \u03c4 (\u03b7) and \u03b6rad (\u03b7) (see\nEqn.[C3]) can be uniquely obtained . Obviously \u0393 decreases with increasing \u03b7 (Fig.3), and\nreaches to \u0393 = 1 when \u03b7 approaches a certain value. This in fact takes an infinite time\nand results in an infinite non-dimensional time duration \u03c4rec (see Eqn.[C4] and Eqn.[C5]).\nSo, to circumvent the difficulty, we consider an effective lower limit \u0393min for the Lorentz\nfactor of shocked matter, which yields an effective upper limit for non-dimensional time\n\u03c4 . We adopted \u0393min = 2 as a lower cut-off. Then, following the procedure explained in\nappendix C, for a specific cloud thickness L, and correspondingly a specific \u03b7L (Eqn.[C13]),\nthe non-dimensional time duration \u03c4rec (\u03b8, \u03b7L ) of a GRB can be calculated for every \u03b8 and\n\u03b7L (Fig.4). Let's denote the radius corresponding to \u0393min by \u03b7m so that \u0393min \u2261 \u0393(\u03b7m ), and\nrecall that in the model, for \u03b7m < \u03b7L , the emitted photons would be completely scattered by\nthe electrons of not-swept part of the cloud (that they have to pass through, before entering\nfree space; see appendix C), and so, the whole phenomenon may be called a \"failed GRB \".\nBut, if \u03b7m > \u03b7L , the shocked matter succeeds to go out of the cloud and, as explained in\n\u00a7 4.3, due to a suppression process that intensively decreases the cross-section of Compton\nscattering,(the major part of)the emitted photons finally succeed\nfrom the\np to get released\n\u22121\nshocked medium and enter free space, provided that \u03b6(\u03b7L ) > [ 5/3 \u0393(\u03b7L )] (see appendix\nB). It is really for this reason that \u03c4rec happens to be a function of \u03b7L , and practically\nindependent of \u03b7m . Then, solving \u03c4rec (\u03b8, \u03b7L ) for \u03b7L numerically, we can obtain the function\n\u03b7L (\u03c4rec , \u03b8) which is the equivalent non-dimensional form of expression (15). We rewrite\nequation(19) in a non-dimensional form suitable for numerical computations:\n\uf8ee \u0010\n\u00112 \uf8f9\nl(n\u03bd/E)\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ \u03c0 Z \u221e\n\u03b7L (\u03c4rec , \u03b8) \u2212 1 \uf8fa\n2\ndp\n1\n\u2212(\u03bd \u2212 1)2\nL\n\uf8ef\u2212\n=\nexp\nexp\n\uf8f0\n\uf8fb\nd log \u03c4rec\n2\u033a \u03c2 \u03b8=0 \u03bd=0\n2\u033a2\n2\u03c2 2\nl(n\u03bd/E)\n\u00d7\nL\n\n\u0012\n\nd\u03b7L\nd log \u03c4rec\n\n\u0013\n\nsin \u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03bd,\n\n(24)\n\n\u03bd,\u03b8\n\nin which, equation(C13) and the definitions below:\n\u03bd \u2261 n/n ,\n\u033a \u2261 \u03c3n /n ,\nand\n\u03c2 \u2261 \u03c3L /L\nare used. So, after choosing the quantities L, \u03c3L , n, \u03c3n , and of course E, we can evaluate\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nthe integral appearing in equation(24). Then, after choosing a value for q, the integral of\nequation(23) can be performed to obtain the observable quantity dp/dlogT\u2295 .\nAs seen in equation(24), the initial kinetic energy E and the cloud mean density n appear\nonly in the form E/n, and therefore they can not be found separately in a fitting process,\nand all that can be obtained is only their ratio. But, the observed fluence of GRBs reveals\nthat the released energy in GRBs is of order of Eiso \u223c 1052 ergs for a isotropic burst, which\nreduces to (\u03a9/4\u03c0)Eiso if the bursts were confined to a cone with a solid angle \u03a9. We used this\namount of isotropic energy to relate E to \u03b60 (E \u2261 Eiso \u03b602/2), and reduce the free parameters\nof the model to seven as \u03930 , \u03b60 , L, \u03c3L , n, \u03c3n and q, which hereafter are called \u03a0 parameters.\nThese parameters must be chosen so that the results make the best fitting to the observed\ndistribution of GRBs. To achieve the task, one must search in the seven dimensional \u03a0\nspace, and find the point in which the statistical quantity \u03c72 takes the smallest value \u03c72min .\nWe used the BATSE 4th catalogue (Paciesas et al. 1999) of 1234 GRBs and adopted the\nbins \u2206 log T\u2295 = 0.2 in a range \u22121.9 \u2264 log T\u2295 < 2.9, and used the gradient search technique\nto move toward the best point in which \u03c72 gets minimized. The obtained fitted values are:\n\u03930 = 0.97 \u00d7 103\n\n\u03b60 = 0.01\n\n\u03c3L = 0.21L\n\n\u03c3n = 0.71n\n\n13\n\nL = 1.7 \u00d7 10 cm\n\nn = 2.9 \u00d7 1017 cm\u22123\n\nq = \u22120.70\n\n(25)\n\nwith a corresponding value \u03c72min = 1.4 (per degree of freedom). As can be seen in Fig.5, the\ndeviation from a more perfect coincidence to data seems for the structure in the observed distribution located around log T\u2295 \u223c 0.7. The structure has been noted before (Yu et al. 1998).\nWe put aside the the data of the noted structure, which are ones with durations between\n0.3 < log(T\u2295 ) < 0.9, and again repeated the numerical searching process in the parametric\nspace. The new obtained values of the fitted parameters are:\n\n\u03930 = 0.96 \u00d7 103\n\n\u03b60 = 0.01\n\n\u03c3L = 0.21L\n\n\u03c3n = 0.71n\n\n13\n\nL = 1.8 \u00d7 10 cm\nq = \u22120.70\n\nn = 2.9 \u00d7 1017 cm\u22123\n(26)\n\nwhich slightly differ from what previously obtained (Eqn.[25]). But this time, \u03c72min reduces\nto 1.1 (Fig.6). So the mentioned structure may be interpreted as a result of an independent\nphenomenon or effect which was not considered in our model.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n4.\n4.1.\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe GRB Source\n\nThough the original shapes of equations (13) and (14) are naturally normalized, the\nresulting final equations (19) and (23) are not, because:\n1)the bursts that their symmetry axes make an angle \u03b8 > \u03b6rad (\u03b7L ) can not be detected (see\nappendix C),\n2)the bursts for which \u03b7m < \u03b7L were not considered in the numerical computations (because\nthey do not manage to cross out the cloud).\nR3\nThe total probability of observing the occurred bursts, \u22123 (dp/d log T\u2295 ) d log T\u2295 , is obtained\nto be 1.47 \u00d7 10\u22126 , using our best fit parameters(Eqn.[26]). This small probability must be\ninterpreted to be due to the above two reasons. The first reason describes the suppression of\nobserved GRBs by the term (\u03a9/4\u03c0) \u223c \u03b602 /2 \u223c 10\u22124 , while the second is responsible for the\nremaining factor of 10\u22122 . So, only about one percent of the bursts manage to produce a real\nGRB, and only about 10\u22124 of these GRBs occur in our line of sight. Of course, the lateral\nspreading of the ejecta+swept mass may modify these two factors, increasing the first and\ndecreasing the second.\nWith the values for the fitted parameters in equation(25) or in equation(26), the mean mass\n3\nof the clouds M \u2261 34 \u03c0nmp L is about 1.2 \u00d7 1034 gr \u2248 6M\u2299 , which is of the order of the\nenvelop mass in massive stars. Such amorphous clouds seem strange in stars, but in close\nneutron star-supergiant binaries where the neutron star orbits around the core and accrete\nthe envelope, the spherical symmetry is likely removed, as pointed out by Podsiadlowski et\nal. (1995). Terman, Taam, & Hernquist (1995) show that the system would emerge to form\na red supergiant with a massive Thorne-Zytkow Object (TZO) (Thorne & Zytkow 1977).\nPodsiadlowski et al. (1995) also estimated a TZO birth-rate of \u2265 10\u22124 yr \u22121 in the galaxy.\nConsidering equation(D4) and the obtained total probability of observing a \"real\" GRB,\nwhich is 1.47 \u00d7 10\u22126 in our model (see above), it is seen that the GRB observation rate (2\nevents per day) implies a total (real+failed) GRB rate of the order of \u223c 10\u22123 Mpc\u22123 yr \u22121.\nThis is not too far from what Podsiadlowski et al. (1995) theoretically estimated for TZO\nbirth-rate (\u2265 10\u22124 galaxy \u22121 yr \u22121). Qin et al. (1998) introduced AICNS (Accretion-Induced\nCollapse of Neutron Stars) scenario as GRB engines. Katz (1994) introduces a dense cloud\nmodel to explain the observed Gev gamma-rays in a number of GRBs (Dingus et al. 1993;\nJones et al. 1996, e.g.), and suggests the amorphous envelops of TZOs for these clouds.\nThe initial opening angle of the ejecta in our model (\u03b60 \u2243 10\u22122 rad \u2248 0.6\u25e6 ) is obtained\nduring the fitting process (\u00a7 3). Such a small opening angle for an ejecta or a jet might\nbe explained by attributing it to the collimating process of an ultra-relativistic ejecta with\n\u03930 > 1/\u03b60 in a sufficiently high magnetic field (Begelman,Blandford,&Rees 1984). The initial\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nLorentz factor of the ejecta, as obtained in our model (\u03930 \u2243 103 , see Eqn.[25]) provides the\nnecessary condition of \u03930 > 1/\u03b60 . Aside from these theoretical justifications for the idea of\na highly collimated ejecta at the source, there are some pieces of evidences supporting this\nidea (Lamb,Donaghy,& Graziani 2004; Waxman 2003; Granot 2003).\n\n4.2.\n\nThe Bimodality\n\nAt the mean time the observed bimodality must be interpreted as a result of the second\nreason expressed in \u00a7 4.1. Though in our model one may expect only one heap in the logT\u2295\ndistribution associated with the directions in the clouds having both the most probable L\nand n (which are equal or near to L and n), but as the numerical computation shows, such\ndirections in the clouds are too thick and too dense to be crossed out by the ejecta, and\ntherefore a real GRB would not be produced. So, we are left with four other regions with\nhigh probabilities:\n1) n \u223c n and L < L (short GRBs)\n2) n \u223c n and L > L (no GRBs)\n3) n > n and L \u223c L (no GRBs)\n4) n < n and L \u223c L (long GRBs)\nNow, we show that the directions trough the clouds associated with region(1) produce the\nshort duration GRBs, and ones associated to regions (2) and (3) produce no GRB, while the\nothers in the forth region produce the long duration ones.\nAs to the equation(9) the quantity l(n/E) (which is of the order of the sedov length) is\n\u223c 7 \u00d7 1011 cm \u226a L for n \u223c n (see Eqn.[25]). As seen in Fig.7, the time duration of GRBs\nassociated to such directions is of the order of the time duration of short GRBs (Case (1)\nabove). Fig.8 shows that in our model the calculated time duration of GRBs for n \u223c 10\u22126 n\nis of the order of the duration of long GRBs. Using equation(9), we see that in this case (\nn \u223c 10\u22126 n ), l(n/E) is about 5 \u00d7 1013 cm \u223c L. So in our model the long duration GRBs\nare due to the passing of ejecta through the directions where n \u226a n and L \u223c L (case (4)\nabove). Furthermore, Since l(n/E) \u226a L when n \u223c n, we see that in cases (2) and (3)\nabove, the ejecta would stop in the dense cloud and the produced photons can not scape\nfrom the optically thick cloud. In Fig.9, Trec (L; n, \u03b8) is plotted for a number of densities,\nwhen \u03b7L = L/l(n/E) has the highest permitted value \u03b7m .\nThese general features of our calculations result from the general features of our model, and\ntherefore we speculate that any distributions for the clouds thickness and density which are\npicked around a mean value could explain the general features of the duration distribution.\nOur chose of gaussian distributions for thickness and density was only for the few parameters\nneeded to describe them.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n4.3.\n\nThe Opacity\n\nIn \"The Dense Cloud Model\" at this stage we have simply omitted the bursts which\nejectas can not go out of the cloud and stop in it (because the emitted photons would be\nscattered by the dense cloud), and we have claimed that the produced photons by all bursts\nthat succeed to cross out the dense cloud can finally enter the free space.\nAt the first glance the model might appear to have a serious problem in opacity, namely,\nin this model the best fit mean density and mean thickness of the clouds are found to be\nof the orders of n \u223c 1017 cm\u22123 and L \u223c 1013 cm. So, as to the relation \u03c4op = \u03c3T n L,\n(\u03c3T = 6.65 \u00d7 10\u221225 cm2 ) one would expect an optical depth of the order of 106 . But there\nare two factors that remedy the situation:\n(i) As the numerical calculation shows (see \u00a7 4.2), the most probable directions characterized by n \u223c n and L \u223c L are dynamically too thick to be crossed out by the ejecta and the\nradiation produced in this case would be completely scattered by the dense cloud. On the\nother hand, as discussed in \u00a7 4.2, the long duration GRBs are due to the crossing of ejecta\nthrough directions where n \u223c 10\u22126 n and L \u223c L. since the density is reduced by the factor\n10\u22126 , the optical depth drops to the order of 1. As explained in \u00a7 4.2, the short duration\nGRBs are due to the directions in the cloud where n \u223c n and L \u223c 10\u22122 L. In this case the\noptical depth of the cloud reduces to \u223c 104 , which is yet too high. But,\n(ii) most of photons emitted off the shock front have the chance to be overtaken by the moving shock (appendix B). Moreover, it has been shown (Shekh-Momeni & Samimi 2004) that\nin high temperatures kT \u223c 106 me c2 the cross section of Compton scattering for instance\nfor Mev photons effectively drops to \u223c 10\u22126 \u03c3T , so such a high temperature plasma is much\nmore transparent than what may seem at first. The same is true for the case of a power\nlaw distribution of electrons (see Eqn.[A4]). Most of the electrons in such a distribution\nhave energies of the order of \u03b3e,min me c2 \u223c 2 \u00d7 105 me c2 , in which we have used equation(A5),\ntaking p = 2.5, \u03bee = 1/3 and \u0393 = 103 . For this case the Compton cross section suppresses by\nthe factor of \u223c 10\u22123 \u2212 10\u22124 for 100ev \u2212 1Kev photons (the energy of the emitted photons in\nthe shocked medium comoving frame is less than their observed energy by the factor of \u0393),\nand therefore, the optical depth drops to the order of 1. So the photons overtaken by the\nshocked medium may remain in it without being scattered until the shocked medium crosses\nup the dense cloud. Briefly, due to this second factor, the optical depth in short duration\ncase diminishes to \u03c4op \u223c 1, and the optical depth in long duration case diminishes to \u03c4op \u226a 1.\nThe variability seen in the light curves of long duration GRBs maybe attributed to the heterogeny of cloud's density in the ejecta's trajectory. This maybe the case in long duration\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nGRBs for which \u03c4op \u226a 1, but in short duration GRBs for which \u03c4op \u223c 1, we expect that such\na heterogeny would not be appeared.\nThe lateral expansion of the shocked medium can reduce its density and therefore its optical\ndepth. This effect of course may cool the shocked medium and cause an increase in effective\nCompton cross section in it. The consideration of dynamical feedback makes our modeling\nmuch more complicated and it has been neglected here. In \"The Dense Cloud Model\" at\nthis stage we have simply omitted the bursts which ejectas can not go out of the cloud and\nstop in it, but have claimed that the produced photons by all bursts that succeed to cross\nout the dense cloud can finally enter free space.\nA complete study needs to include flux computations. An exact comparison with observed time duration data would be possible only when the theoretical time duration appearing in this work were exactly evaluated in the same manner as the observable duration T90 is defined (as the time interval over which 5 percent to 95 percent of the burst\ncounts accumulate). Moreover, the BATSE's triggering mechanism made it less sensitive to\nshort GRBs than to long ones and therefore short GRBs were detected to smaller distances\n(Mao,Narayan,& Piran 1994; Cohen & Piran 1995; Katz & Canel 1996), so a smaller number of them have been observed. Lee & Petrosian (1996) studied this effect and corrected\nthe number of short GRBs. In a more exact work this correction must be considered too.\nWe acknowledge the anonymous referee for valuable comments. F.

The synchrotron cooling time in the comoving frame is:\n3me c\ntsyn,co =\n,\n(A1)\n4\u03c3T UB \u03b3e\nwhere \u03c3T is the Thompson cross section and \u03b3e is the Lorentz factor of the emitting electron,\nwhile UB stands for the energy density of magnetic field which in GRB literature is assumed\nto be proportional to u, the comoving internal energy density of the shocked matter:\nUB = \u03beB u ,\n\n(A2)\n\nso that \u03beB represents the share of magnetic field in u, which is given by:\nu = 4\u03932 nmp c2 ,\n\n(A3)\n\nin which, n is the number density of surrounding medium (ISM, or a dense cloud as assumed\nin our model), and \u0393 denotes the Lorentz factor of the shocked matter.\nThe electrons in shocked media are assumed to develop a power law distribution of Lorentz\nfactors:\nN(\u03b3e ) \u221d \u03b3e\u2212p\nf or :\n\u03b3e > \u03b3e,min .\n(A4)\n\nThe convergence of total energy of the electrons requires the power index p to be greater\nthan 2, while the assumed lower limit \u03b3e,min is to prevent the divergence of electron number\ndensity and is obtained to be:\nmp p \u2212 2\n\u03bee \u0393 ,\n(A5)\n\u03b3e,min =\nme p \u2212 1\n\nwhere \u03bee \u2261 ue /u represents the share of the electrons in the internal energy of shocked\nmatter.\nFurthermore, the time interval between emission of two photons from the same point in the\ncomoving frame, \u03b4tco , and the time interval \u03b4t\u2295 , which represents the time interval of their\nsuccessive arrival to a cosmologically distant observer (at the earth), are related as below:\n\u03b4tco\n\u03b4t\u2295 = (1 + z)\n.\n(A6)\n2\u0393\nEquations(A1-A6) are adopted from Piran (1999). Now, by substituting equations(A2),(A3),\n& (A5) in equation(A1), and then using equation(A6), the synchrotron cooling time measured by a terrestrial observer turns out to be:\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u00132 \u0012\np\u22121\nme\n3\n\u22121 \u22121\n(\u03c3T nc)\u22121 \u0393\u22124 sec\ntsyn,\u2295 < (1 + z)\u03bee \u03beB\n32\nmp\np\u22122\n\u0012 \u0013\u22121 \u0012 \u0013\u22121 \u0010\n\u03beB\nn \u0011\u22121 \u22124\n\u03bee\n\u0393 sec ,\n(A7)\n\u223c 10\u221212 (1 + z)\n0.1\n0.1\n1018\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nwhich is clearly much less than all observed time durations of GRBs. So, the synchrotron\nemission in a dense cloud model must be considered as an instantaneous process, and therefore the shock front must be regarded as the emitting surface. This allows us to attribute\ntime duration of a GRB merely to the time that the shock front takes to cross the dense cloud.\n\nB.\n\nThe relation between Lorentz factors of the shocked matter and the\nemitting surface\n\nHere, we want to find the relation between \u0393 and \u0393\u2032 which are respectively the Lorentz\nfactors of the shocked matter and of the shock front (which is the emitting surface in our\nmodel; see appendix A). In Fig.10, \u03b2 and \u03b2 \u2032 correspond to shocked matter and shock front\nspeeds, both measured in the (central) source frame. In the shocked matter frame (Fig.11)\nthe dense cloud which is seen to have a density \u0393 n, moves toward the shocked medium with\na speed \u03b2, while being compressed to a density equal to 4\u0393n. Consequently, as illustrated in\n\u2032\nwhich is in fact the speed\nFig.11, the shocked medium expands towards right with a speed \u03b2co\nof the shock front in the shocked matter frame (compare Fig.10 and Fig.11). Considering\nthe conservation of nucleon number, it is seen that:\n\u2032\n\u03b2co\n=\n\n\u03b2\n.\n4\n\n(B1)\n\nConsidering the relativistic summation of velocities, we have:\n\u2032\n\u03b2co\n+\u03b2\n.\n\u2032\n1 + \u03b2\u03b2co\n\n\u03b2\u2032 =\n\n(B2)\n\nNoting the relations \u0393 = (1 \u2212\u03b2 2 )\u22121/2 and \u0393\u2032 = (1 \u2212\u03b2 \u2032 2 )\u22121/2 , the substitution of equation(B1)\nin equation(B2) finally yields:\nr\n5\n\u2032\n\u0393 \u2243\n\u0393,\n(B3)\n3\nThe distance from the origin to the shock front, denoted by r \u2032 , can be obtained by integrating\n\u03b2 \u2032 over t:\nZ\nt\n\nr\u2032 =\n\n\u03b2 \u2032 cdt + r0 .\n\n(B4)\n\n0\n\nThe results are shown in Fig.12. As seen, the difference between r and r \u2032 never exceeds one\npercent. This result justifies the use of symbol r (instead of r \u2032 )for the location of the shock\nfront through out our formulation.\nNow, let's consider a photon that is radiated from the shock front (the emitting surface)\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nmoving with the Lorentz factor \u0393\u2032 (Eqn.[B3]), in a direction which makes an angle \u01eb with\nthe velocity vector of the shocked matter (Fig.10). if :\n\u01eb > \u0393\u2032\u22121 ,\n\n(B5)\n\nthe photon would be overtaken by the shock front. The majority of the emitted photons\nfulfill this condition when \u0393\u2032 \u223c 103 and \u03b60 \u223c 10\u22122 (see Eqn.[25]).\nC.\n\nGeometrical Considerations\n\nHere the effect of burster geometry on the observed time duration is investigated. At\nfirst, as shown in Fig.13, we consider a radiating segment on the shock front. The symmetry\naxis is denoted by z \u2032 . Noting the definition of \u01eb in the figure, it is seen that in addition to a\nradial component dr/dt, the velocity vector of the segment must have a lateral component\nvlat which is equal to:\n\u01eb\nvlat =\ncs ,\n(C1)\n\u0393(\u03b7)\u03b6(\u03b7)\nas measured in the source frame. In equation(C1) the non-dimensional radius \u03b7, as defined\nin equation(8), is used instead of r, . Equation(C1) is obtained simply by using equation(5)\nand assuming that the lateral speed of the segment in a frame moving (only radially and)\ninstantaneously along with the segment, is the fraction \u01eb/\u03b6(\u03b7) of sound speed cs (which is the\nlateral speed of the emitting surface at its edges), and noting that the lateral speed in the\nsource frame is less than its corresponding value in the (radially instantaneous) comoving\nframe by the factor 1/\u0393. It is well known that the radiation emitted by the segment is almost\nconfined to an angle 1/\u0393. In Fig.13 the axis of the radiation cone emitted by the segment\nis denoted by z \u2032\u2032 , which is parallel to the velocity vector of the segment and, as seen in the\nfigure, makes an angle \u01eb + \u03b4 with z \u2032 axis, where \u03b4 = tan\u22121 [\u01ebcs /(\u0393\u03b2c\u03b6)]. So the radiation\nangle \u03b6rad (\u03b7, \u01eb) (as depicted in the figure) can be written as below:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u01eb cs /c\n\u22121\n+ 1/\u0393(\u03b7) ,\n(C2)\n\u03b6rad (\u03b7, \u01eb) = \u01eb + tan\n\u0393(\u03b7) \u03b2(\u03b7) \u03b6(\u03b7)\nand the total radiation angle, defined as the radiation angle at the edge of the emitting\nsurface, can be written as:\n\u0013\n\u0012\ncs /c\n\u22121\n+ 1/\u0393(\u03b7) .\n(C3)\n\u03b6rad (\u03b7) \u2261 \u03b6rad (\u03b7, \u01eb = \u03b6(\u03b7)) = \u03b6(\u03b7) + tan\n\u0393(\u03b7) \u03b2(\u03b7)\nThis angle represents the cone of space illuminated by the emitting surface. Using the results\nof equation(7), the total radiation angle can be evaluated for every \"\u03b7\". Having defined the\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\ntotal radiation angle, we explore the effect of burster geometry on its observed time duration\nT\u2295 . As shown in Fig.2, the problem is studied in a spherical coordinate system in which the\ncentral engine is taken as the origin, and the line-of-sight as the polar axis z. Consider a\nphoton emitted off a point on the emitting surface (the shock front) with radial coordinate\nr and polar coordinate \u0398; and at an instance t, measured in the source frame (the point\nis not shown in the figure). The relation between t and the photon arrival time trec to a\n(cosmologically) near observer is obtained by Granot, Piran, & Sari (1999). Making suitable\nfor our model, it is adjusted to the form below:\ntrec = t \u2212\n\nr cos \u0398 \u2212 r0\n.\nc\n\n(C4)\n\nIn this equation the instance t = 0 is defined as the time that the ejecta collides with the\ndense cloud at r = r0 ; while trec = 0 is the time that the (cosmologically) near observer\nreceives the photon emitted at t = 0 from the point with coordinates r = r0 and \u0398 = 0.\nDefining:\nc trec\n,\n(C5)\n\u03c4rec \u2261\nl(n/E)\nand noting equation(8) and equation(12), we rewrite equation(C4) in the form below:\n\u03c4rec = \u03c4 \u2212 \u03b7 cos \u0398 + \u03b70 .\n\n(C6)\n\nMultiplying equation(C4) by the cosmological time dilation term (1+z), results in the arrival\ntime as maybe observed at the earth:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nr cos \u0398 \u2212 r0\n,\n(C7)\nt\u2295 = (1 + z)trec = (1 + z) t \u2212\nc\nor equivalently:\n\u03c4\u2295 = (1 + z)\u03c4rec = (1 + z)(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03b7 cos \u0398 + \u03b70 ) ,\n\n(C8)\n\nin which we used the non-dimensional time duration \u03c4\u2295 defined as below:\n\u03c4\u2295 \u2261\n\nc t\u2295\n.\nl(n/E)\n\n(C9)\n\nNow, as shown in Fig.2, we consider a situation where the ejecta's symmetry axes makes an\nangle \u03b8 with the line of sight. The necessary condition that at least some photons of the\nemitting surface are detected by the near observer is:\n\u03b6rad (\u03b7) > \u03b8 .\n\n(C10)\n\nHere we denote the inverse of function \u03b6rad (\u03b7) by \u03b7rad (\u03b6rad ), which gives the radius corresponding to \u03b6rad . As seen in Fig.2, for \u03b8's larger than \u03b6rad (\u03b70 ), the first photons reaching the\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\ndetectors are those emitted at \u03b7 = \u03b7rad (\u03b8). So, we use \u03c4 (\u03b7) (which is obtainable by solving\nequation(11)) to write:\n\u001a\n0\nif \u03b8 < \u03b6rad (\u03b70 )\n,\n(C11)\n\u03c41 (\u03b8) =\n\u03c4 (\u03b7rad (\u03b8)) if \u03b8 > \u03b6rad (\u03b70 )\nwhere \u03c41 (\u03b8) represents the starting time (in the source frame) that the emitted photons can\nreach the (cosmologicaly near) observer. Now, using the numerical results of equation(11)\nwe can obtain the function \u03b7(\u03c4 ). Then, considering equation(C6), the non-dimensional time\n\u03c4rec,1 (\u03b8) corresponding to \u03c41 (\u03b8) would be as below:\n\uf8f1\n: \u03b8 < \u03b60\n\uf8f20\n: \u03b60 < \u03b8 < \u03b6rad (\u03b70 ) . (C12)\n\u03c4rec,1(\u03b8) = \u2212\u03b70 cos(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b60 ) + \u03b70\n\uf8f3\n\u03c4 (\u03b7rad (\u03b8)) \u2212 \u03b7rad (\u03b8) cos[\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b6(\u03b7rad (\u03b8))] + \u03b70 : \u03b8 > \u03b6rad (\u03b70 )\n\nNow, we are to find the time \u03c4rec,2 (\u03b8) after which no photons can be detected by the near\nobserver. In Fig.2, the photons emitted from the edge point A can reach us at all times\ngreater than \u03c41 (\u03b8). Let's remind that in our model the emission process terminates at the\ntime that the shocked matter goes out of the cloud (appendix A). As is seen in equation(C6),\nthe closer to the point B is a point on the emitting surface, the later its emitted photons\nwould reach the near observer, of course, provided that the observer line-of-sight remains in\nthe radiation cone of the emitting point.\nDefining:\nr0 + L\n\u03b7L \u2261\n,\n(C13)\nl(n/E)\nand recalling equation(C2), we can solve the equation:\n\u03b6rad (\u03b7L , \u01eb) = \u03b8 ,\n\n(C14)\n\nto find the function \u01eb = \u01eb(\u03b7L , \u03b8), which specifies the furthest point (on the shock front at the\nradius \u03b7L ) which its radiation reaches us, of course, if it remains smaller than \u03b6(\u03b7L ).\nNow, using equation(C6), we can find the instance that the last photons reach the near\nobserver:\n\u03c4rec,2 (\u03b8, \u03b7L , \u03b70 ) = \u03c4 (\u03b7L ) \u2212 \u03b7L cos(\u03b8 + min[\u01eb(\u03b7L , \u03b8), \u03b6(\u03b7L )]) + \u03b70 .\n(C15)\nFinally, the non-dimensional time duration of a GRB, \u03c4rec (\u03b8, \u03b7L ), will be equal to \u03c4rec,2(\u03b8, \u03b7L )\u2212\n\u03c4rec,1 (\u03b8) and, as to equation(C12) and equation(C15), besides being a function of parameters\nof the ejecta and the cloud, it is also a function of the inclination angle \u03b8. So, the time\nduration of a GRB as measured by an observer cosmologivally near to it would be a function\nof L, n, and \u03b8:\nTrec = Trec (L; n, \u03b8) ,\n(C16)\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nwhere:\n\nl (n/E)\n,\n(C17)\nc\nThe expression(C16) needs some explanations. In our model the ejecta parameters \u03b60 , E\nand \u03930 and the radius r0 are assumed to be the same in all GRBs. So, these parameters do\nnot appear in equation(C16) explicitly , though it is implicitly a function of them too. At the\nmean time, the cloud's density n and its thickness L are assumed to be different in different\ndirections, and therefore they do appear explicitly in the expression (C16). Furthermore, if\na cloud thickness L is much more than its associated Sedov length lsedov \u2261 (E/n mp c2 )1/3 ,\nthe ejecta may not cross it up, and finally stops in it. In such a situation the time duration\nof a GRB would not be a function of L, while it still remains dependent on n and \u03b8. This\nis why in expression (C16), the quantity L is distinguished from n and \u03b8 by a semicolon.\nThe rearrangement of the expression(C16) in the form L = L(Trec , )\u03b8, n would be meaningful\nonly when we are dealt with the situation where the ejecta succeed to cross up the cloud\n(see Eqn.[15]).\nTrec = \u03c4rec (\u03b8, \u03b7L )\n\nD.\n\nThe explicit form of FGRB (z)\n\nHere the relation between FGRB (z) appearing in equation(23) and the GRB occurring\nrate fGRB (z) (in units of Mpc\u22123 yr \u22121) is derived, so that by adopting a cosmological model\nfor the occurring rate, the integral in equation(23) can be evaluated.\nThe number of GRBs that their effects could reach us in a time interval \u03b4t0 (which is very\nmuch less than the present comoving time t0 ), and from a spherical volume element \u03b4Vz\n(disregarding various effects, such as the geometrical ones discussed in appendix C, or those\nrelated to detectors threshold which affect the number of detected GRBs) is as below:\n\u03b4t0\n1+z\n\u03b4t0\n3\n2\n= fGRB (z). 4\u03c0R (z) r (z) \u03b4r(z)\n,\n1+z\n\u03b4 2 NGRB = fGRB (z) \u03b4Vz\n\n(D1)\n\nwhere r(z) denotes the non-dimensional radial parameter of the source that its effects reach\nus with a red shift z, and R(z), the scale factor at this red shift. In Einstein-de Sitter model\nwe have:\n2c\n{1 \u2212 (1 + z)\u22121/2 } ,\n(D2)\nR0 r(z) =\nH0\nwhere H0 is the Hubble constant. Furthermore, in FRW metrics:\nR(z) = R0 (1 + z)\u22121 ,\n\n(D3)\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nwhere R0 \u2261 R(z = 0). Now, using equations(D2) and (D3) in equation(D1) we obtain:\n\u03b4 2 NGRB\nFGRB (z) \u221d\n= 2\u03c0\n\u03b4t0 \u03b4z\n\n\u0012\n\n2c\nH0\n\n\u00133\n\n(1 + z)\n\n\u221211/2\n\n2\n\n{1 \u2212 (1 + z)\u22121/2 } fGRB (z) .\n\n(D4)\n\nWhat is remained is the explicit form of fGRB (z). The high variability seen in GRB light\ncurves has convinced the investigators to relate GRBs to stellar objects , and consequently\ntheir rate fGRB (z) to the star formation rate fSF (z). The simplest model is of course a\nproportional model fGRB (z) \u221d fSF (z). the proportional model may be correct if GRBs are\nattributed to the evolution of massive stars whose lifetime is negligible in comparison with\nthe cosmological time scale, but in NS-NS mergers model the proportionality may not be\nvalid (because of the delay time from the star formation to NS-NS mergers). Wijers et\nal. (1998) claimed that there is a good consistency between the proportional model and\nthe observed GRB brightness distribution, while Petrosian & Lloyd (1998) concluded that\nnone of the NS-NS and the proportional model are in agreement with the observed fSF (z).\nTotani (1999) ascribed this discrepancy to the uncertainties in SFR observations. Anyway\nwe simply assume the GRB rate to be as below:\nfGRB (z) = fGRB (0)(1 + z)\n\n3+q\n\n,\n\n(D5)\n\nand treat q as a free parameter that its best value should be obtained during the fitting\nprocedure. In Fig.14, FGRB (z) is plotted for a number of q's. Clearly the case q = 0\ncorresponds to a universe where the changes in the rates of astrophysical phenomena are\nonly due to its expansion (non-evolutionary universe). It can be seen that FGRB (z) takes its\nmaximum at z \u223c 1, which is not very sensitive to the magnitude of q.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nREFERENCES\nAkerlof, C.

The point S would be the furthest\nvisible point on the shock front, since the line of sight fells out of the radiation cone of the\npoints farther than it (points between S and B). If \u01eb(\u03b7L , \u03b8) > \u03b6(\u03b7L ), then the point B would\nbe the last visible point (see Eqn.[C15]).\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- The Lorentz factor of shocked medium \u0393(\u03b7) versus the non-dimensional radius \u03b7,\nwith \u03930 = 1000 and \u03b60 = 0.01 (see Eqn.[7]).\n\nFig. 4.- The evaluated non-dimensional time duration \u03c4rec (\u03b8, \u03b7L ) of GRBs, versus \u03b8 and \u03b7L ,\nwith \u03930 = 1000 and \u03b60 = 0.01, (see appendix C).\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\n\nFig. 5.- Results of best fitting.

It is plotted\nversus the inclination angle \u03b8 for a number of possible thicknesses \u03b7L . As seen, the order of\ntime durations are of the order of ones in short duration GRBs (see \u00a7 4.2).\n\nFig. 8.- The time duration of GRBs, evaluated in our model with n = 10\u22126n. It is plotted\nversus the inclination angle \u03b8 for a number of possible thicknesses \u03b7L .

In the figure, if the angle \u01eb were larger than 1/\u0393\u2032 the photon would be\novertaken by the shock front (from which it were emitted), so that the photon would remain\nin the shocked medium (see appendix B).\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\n\n\u2032\n\u03b2co\n\n\u03b2\n\n\u2032\nFig. 11.- The shock front (emitting surface) speed \u03b2co\n, measured in the shocked frame. In\nthis frame the cloud has a density of \u0393n and moves toward the shocked medium with a speed\n\u2032\n\u03b2, and becomes compressed to a density of 4\u0393n. So clearly we have \u03b2co\n= \u03b2/4 (see appendix\nB).\n\nFig. 12.- (r \u2032 \u2212 r)/r versus \u03b7 \u2261 r/l(n/E), with n = 2.9 \u00d7 1017 cm\u22123 (see appendix B).\n\n\f\u2013 29 \u2013\n\nFig. 13.- Geometry of Radiation.
