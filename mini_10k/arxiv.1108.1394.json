This set of universes is often called the string landscape [1], and is\nequipped with a, in principle computable, effective potential. In a scenario where our universe is described by fluctuations around a particular minimum of this potential, particle\nmasses and couplings are given by local curvatures at the minimum. But there might also\nbe more subtle observational effects depending on the large scale structure of the potential.\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fOne important topographical feature, relevant for many effects in string cosmology,\nis the existence of sequences of vacua connected by continuous potential barriers. When\nquantum effects are taken into account, tunnelling can occur between the vacua, with a\nprobability that is computable once the features of the potential barrier are known. From\nthe space-time perspective, the tunnelling process consists of the nucleation of a bubble of\nthe new vacuum inside the old vacuum phase. Depending on the tunnelling rate, and the\nexpansion rates of the new and old universes, the transition to the new vacuum is either\ncomplete or partial. The latter case, when part of space-time remains in the old vacuum,\nis known as eternal inflation [2\u20134]. Potentially, bubble collisions in such a cosmological\nscenario could leave an observable imprint in the CMBR [5, 6], and this was recently\ncompared with the WMAP 7-year results [7, 8].\nAnother interesting possibility is that of chain inflation [9\u201312], see also [13]. In this\nkind of models, inflation results from sequential tunnelling in a chain of de Sitter universes,\neach supporting just part of an e-folding. To be a viable option, chain inflation requires the\nexistence of sequences of neighbouring vacua with certain properties. Other effects hinging\non our local landscape surroundings are resonance tunnelling [14], \"giant leaps\" between\nfar-away vacua [15], and disappearing instantons [16, 17] - effects that can greatly affect\ntunnelling probabilities. In all these cases, detailed knowledge of the potential is required\nto obtain quantitative results.\nOne part of the landscape that offers fairly accurate analytical and numerical control\nis the complex structure moduli space of type IIB flux compactifications. Fluxes piercing\nnon-trivial three-cycles of the internal geometry generate a potential with discrete minima\nfor the complex structure moduli and axio-dilaton. Each of these minima corresponds,\nafter fixing of the K\u00e4hler moduli [18\u201320], to a vacuum in the landscape. The reason for the\nmathematical tractability of many of these models is that the internal manifold remains\nconformally Calabi\u2013Yau after the introduction of fluxes, making the powerful tool-kit of\nspecial geometry applicable. Indeed, as demonstrated in Ref. [21, 22], the potential of the\nresulting four-dimensional N = 1 supergravity is determined by the Gukov\u2013Vafa\u2013Witten\nsuperpotential [23] making it straightforward to compute.\nTaking advantage of this fact, type IIB flux compactifications and the resulting potential have been studied in many contexts. In Ref. [24] it was shown that D3-brane black\nholes, which also affect the potential for the moduli, must be small to affect the minimisation, but can then potentially serve as seeds for bubble nucleation, and in Ref. [25], explicit\nprofiles of BPS domain walls interpolating between different vacua were obtained. Exploiting the fact that fluxes transform under monodromy transformations, it was demonstrated\nin [26, 27] that long sequences of continuously connected vacua are a common feature in\nthe landscape, thus opening up the possibility of chain inflation or resonance tunnelling in\nthis framework. These studies were extended in [28], where the tunnelling probabilities between vacua in the sequence were first computed. Moreover, Ref. [16, 29] investigated the\ninfluence of the universal K\u00e4hler modulus on tunnelling rates and domain wall dynamics\nin this setting.\nRecently, Ahlqvist et al. [30] continued these investigations of type IIB vacuum sequences by a thorough study of a class of one-parameter Calabi\u2013Yau models. This revealed\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fseveral intriguing features, both in the tunnelling dynamics and in the vacuum structure.\nFor vacua connected by conifold monodromies, it was demonstrated that the tunnelling\ntrajectories tend to pass close to the conifold point. Furthermore, long sequences of connected minima seemingly accumulating to the large complex structure (LCS) point were\nfound. It was left as an open question whether these sequences continue indefinitely or not.\nThat the sequences approach the LCS point is particularly interesting in view of the no-go\ntheorem [31] derived by Ashok and Douglas stating that infinite sequences of vacua with\nimaginary self-dual (ISD) flux can only occur if they accumulate to so-called D-limits -\none example of which is the LCS point. It is the aim of the present paper to investigate if\nit is possible to have infinite sequences of minima accumulating to the LCS point, and in\nparticular to determine whether the sequences found in [30] end or not.\nPrevious studies [32\u201335] of the finiteness of type IIB flux vacua have mainly been based\non the statistical methods pioneered in [36, 37]. (For reviews, consult e.g. [38, 39].) This\napproach uses a continuum approximation of the fluxes, which allows to relate the density\nof vacua in moduli space to the Euler density of a certain metric on moduli space. As\nthis Euler density is an index, it only gives a lower bound for the true vacuum density\nin principle. The index can be shown to integrate to finite values around regular points\nin moduli space [31]. Its structure around Calabi\u2013Yau singularities has been analysed in\n[34, 35], including both ADE singularities and the LCS points. In both cases the index\nintegrates to finite results. For results concerning the finiteness of the intersecting D-brane\nlandscape, see e.g. [40\u201342].\nIn this work we complement these statistical studies with a more direct analysis of the\npossibility of having any infinite sequence of ISD vacua. By analysing the geometry of the\ncomplex structure moduli space we flesh out the details of the Ashok\u2013Douglas theorem and\nobtain explicit expressions for a positive definite quadratic form that must stay finite in any\nsequence of ISD vacua. Using this, we derive an extension of the no-go theorem. Namely,\nfor one-parameter Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds, there are no sequences of vacua accumulating to\nthe LCS point. This shows by analytical means that, in particular, the sequences of [30] are\nfinite. We furthermore extend this result to the D-limits corresponding to conifold points\nand decoupling limits, and also study the LCS limit of a two-parameter model.\nIn addition, we treat the case when the compactification manifold is K3 \u00d7 K3, for\nwhich the finiteness is proven in a very different manner [43]. We find that D-limits exist\nand that infinite sequences can be constructed. Hence all but a finite number of the\nsolutions in a sequence must be related by automorphisms of K3. We demonstrate this in\na simple example. Finally, we use numerical methods to study two particular examples of\none-parameter Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds. Using expansions of the periods in the LCS region\nallows us to efficiently compute the scalar potential, and thus follow the sequences of [30]\ncloser to the LCS point. In accordance with the general analysis, the minima eventually\nleave the region close to the LCS point.\nThis paper is organised as follows. Section 2 contains a review on type IIB compactifications and introduces our notation and conventions. We then discuss the no-go theorem\nby Ashok and Douglas and the relevance of D-limits in section 3. Subsequently, we analyse\nthe length of sequences of ISD vacua in various D-limits in type IIB compactifications.\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fDetails of this computation is relegated to appendix A. In section 5, we discuss sequences\nof vacua in D-limits in F-theory compactifications on K3 \u00d7 K3. Through a numerical\nanalysis, we then map out two sequences of type IIB vacua in the LCS region in section 6.\nFinally, we summarise and discuss our results.\n\n2\n\nType IIB moduli stabilisation\n\nIn this section we give a brief review of moduli stabilisation in type IIB supergravity, and\nset the notation and conventions. To aid comparison with that work we use as far as\npossible the notation of [30].\n2.1\n\nCalabi\u2013Yau geometry\n\nWe denote by M a Calabi\u2013Yau manifold with complex structure moduli space M , and let\nC be the combined moduli space of complex structure and the axio-dilaton: (z, \u03c4 ) \u2208 C. The\nperiods of M are\nZ\nZ\nCI \u2227 \u03a9 ,\n\n\u03a9=\n\n\u03a0I =\n\n(2.1)\n\nM\n\nCI\n\nwhere \u03a9 is the holomorphic three-form and CI is a basis in H3 (M). Note that CI is used\nto denote two things: both the cycles and their Poincar\u00e9 duals. The intersection matrix\nQ = (QIJ ) is defined by\nZ\nZ\nQIJ =\nCJ =\nCI \u2227 CJ .\n(2.2)\nM\n\nCI\n\nThe periods are collected into a vector whose entries we number in reverse order\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u03a0N (z)\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\u03a0N \u22121 (z)\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7,\n\u03a0(z) = \uf8ec\n..\n\uf8f7\n.\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\u03a00 (z)\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere z is a h(1,2) -dimensional (complex) coordinate on M and N \u2261 2h1,2 + 1.\nIn our one-parameter examples there are three special points in moduli space: the large\ncomplex structure (LCS) point, the conifold point and the Landau\u2013Ginzburg point. We fix\nthese to lie at z = 0, 1 and z = \u221e, respectively. The periods are subject to monodromies\nupon transport around these points:\n\u03a0 \u2192 T * \u03a0,\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere T is a matrix that preserves the symplectic structure Q. The complex structure\nmoduli space is furthermore equipped with a K\u00e4hler metric, with K\u00e4hler potential\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nZ\nKcs = \u2212 log \uf8edi \u03a9 \u2227 \u03a9\u0304\uf8f8 = \u2212 log(i\u03a0\u2020 * Q\u22121 * \u03a0) .\n(2.5)\nM\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fNote that our integration conventions are such that\nZ\n\u0393\u0304 \u2227 \u2217\u0393 > 0\n\n(2.6)\n\nM\n\nfor any non-zero three-form \u0393. Finally, we define [44] the (antisymmetric, topological,\nmoduli independent) intersection product and the (symmetric, positive definite, moduli\ndependent) scalar product as\nZ\nA(3) \u2227 B(3) = A * Q * B T\n(2.7)\nhA(3) , B(3) i =\nM\nZ\nA(3) \u2227 \u2217B(3) = A * Gz * B T ,\n(2.8)\n(A(3) , B(3) ) =\nM\n\nrespectively. Here, A = (A0 , . . . AN ) is a row vector collecting the components of the form\nA(3) in the basis CI : A(3) = \u2212AI CI , and similarly for B. The matrix Gz is a moduli\ndependent positive quadratic form on CN +1 .\n2.2\n\nFlux vacua\n\nFluxes piercing the three-cycles induce a Gukov\u2013Vafa\u2013Witten superpotential W , leading\nto an N = 1 scalar potential potentially stabilising all complex structure moduli and the\naxio-dilaton. The potential is\n\u0001\nV (z, \u03c4 ) = eK g i\uf6be\u0304 Di W D\uf6be\u0304 W\u0304 + g \u03c4 \u03c4\u0304 D\u03c4 W D\u03c4\u0304 W\u0304 + g \u03c1\u03c1\u0304 D\u03c1 W D\u03c1\u0304 W\u0304 \u2212 3|W |2 ,\n\n(2.9)\n\nwhere g AB\u0304 = (\u2202A \u2202B\u0304 K)\u22121 and DA = \u2202A + \u2202A K with K being the N = 1 K\u00e4hler potential.\nTo compute V all that is needed are expressions for the superpotential W and the K\u00e4hler\npotential K. We denote the three-form fluxes by F(3) (RR) and H(3) (NSNS). We collect\nthe flux quanta in row vectors F = (F 0 , . . . , F N ) defined by\nZ\nF(3) ,\n(2.10)\nF I = \u2212(Q\u22121 )IJ\nCJ\n\nand similarly for H. Note that the vectors F and H are subject to Dirac quantisation.\nTheir entries are integer multiples of 4\u03c0 2 \u03b10 which we fix to unity for convenience. For\nnotational convenience we often use the combined three-form flux\nG(3) = F(3) \u2212 \u03c4 H(3)\n\n(2.11)\n\nwhich can also be represented by a vector, albeit with non-integer components\nG = F \u2212 \u03c4H .\n\n(2.12)\n\nThe superpotential is given by\nZ\n\u03a9 \u2227 G(3) = G * \u03a0 .\n\nW =\nM\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n(2.13)\n\n\fThe K\u00e4hler potential is\nK = \u2212 ln (\u2212i(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4\u0304 )) + Kcs (z, z\u0304) \u2212 3 ln (\u2212i(\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1\u0304)) ,\n\n(2.14)\n\nwhere Kcs is the K\u00e4hler potential on complex structure moduli space, given by (2.5). Due\nto the last term in the K\u00e4hler potential, the contributions of g \u03c1\u03c1\u0304 D\u03c1 W D\u03c1\u0304 W\u0304 and \u22123|W |2\ncancel:\n\u0001\nV (z, \u03c4 ) = eK g i\uf6be\u0304 Di W D\uf6be\u0304 W\u0304 + g \u03c4 \u03c4\u0304 D\u03c4 W D\u03c4\u0304 W\u0304 .\n(2.15)\nUsing (2.13), (2.14) and (2.5), the scalar potential can be computed numerically once the\nperiods and their derivatives are known.\nThe three-form fluxes induce a D3-brane charge density, that must be compensated by\nlocalised sources on the compact manifold. This amounts to the tadpole condition\nZ\nF(3) \u2227 H(3) =\nM\n\n\u03c7\n+ 1 NO3 \u2212 ND3 \u2261 L ,\n24 4\n\n(2.16)\n\nwhere NO3 is the number of O3 planes, ND3 is the number of (space filling) D3 branes in\nthe compactification and \u03c7 counts the tadpole contribution of D7 branes and O7-planes.\nFrom the F-theory perspective, \u03c7 is the Euler chracteristic of (an appropriate resolution\nof) the corresponding elliptic Calabi-Yau four-fold. Expressed in the vectors F and H the\ntadpole condition reads\nF * Q * H T = L.\n\n(2.17)\n\nGiddings, Kachru and Polchinski [22] showed how to solve all equations of motion in the\nabove set-up (see also [21]). For sources satisfying a certain \"BPS-like\" condition and at\ntree level, the equations forces the flux to be imaginary self dual (ISD): \u2217G(3) = iG(3) .\nThis is a condition on the complex structure moduli and the axio-dilaton. In fact, the ISD\ncondition is equivalent to the vanishing of the F-terms related to these moduli. We have\nthe equivalences\nEOMs \u21d0\u21d2 \u2217G(3) = iG(3) \u21d0\u21d2 G(3) \u2208 H (2,1) (M) \u2295 H (0,3) (M)\n(3,0)\n\nD\u03c4 W = 0 \u21d0\u21d2 G(3) = 0\n(1,2)\n\nDi W = 0 \u21d0\u21d2 G(3) = 0\n\n(2.18)\n\n(0,3)\n\nD\u03c1 W = 0 \u21d0\u21d2 W = 0 \u21d0\u21d2 G(3) = 0\nwhere the harmonic representative is understood by the \u2208 in the first line. We see that ISD\nimplies that D\u03c4 W = Di W = 0 but that supersymmetry can well be broken by a non-zero\nD\u03c1 W in ISD minima.\nNote furthermore that if z and \u03c4 are tuned so that the flux is ISD, then the potential\n(2.15) has a global minimum. These minima are discrete, and each such configuration\ncorresponds to an ISD vacuum of the type IIB landscape.\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\f3\n\nSeries in D-limits\n\nLet us now turn to the question of the existence of infinite sequences of ISD vacua. Ashok\nand Douglas [31] have formulated a no-go theorem that restricts the possibility of infinite\nsequences of vacua. They also demonstrated that this theorem can be evaded in the\nvicinity of special points - so-called D-limits - in the moduli space C, one example being\nthe point of large complex structure. In this section we review and make this theorem and\nthe concept of D-limits more precise.\n3.1\n\nThe no-go theorem of Ashok and Douglas\n\nThe two main ingredients of the argument are the tadpole and the ISD conditions. Suppose\nthat we have no anti-D3-branes, and that the flux G(3) is imaginary self dual. These\nconditions include all supersymmetric vacua, but as explained above also other minima.\nWe shall keep these two assumptions throughout this section. We then have that\n\u03c7\n+ 1 NO3 \u2212 ND3 = L\nhF(3) , H(3) i =\n(3.1)\n24 4\nwith L being a number bounded from above since ND3 \u2265 0. On the other hand a short\ncomputation yields\nhF(3) , H(3) i =\n\n1\n1\ni\nh\u1e20(3) , G(3) i =\nh\u1e20(3) , \u2217G(3) i =\n\u1e20 * Gz * GT > 0\n2 Im \u03c4\n2 Im \u03c4\n2 Im \u03c4\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere, in the second step, the imaginary self-duality of G(3) was used. So, in fact, for our\ntype of vacua we have\n\u03c7\n1\n\u1e20 * Gz * GT = L \u2264 Lmax =\n+ 1 NO3 .\n2 Im \u03c4\n24 4\n\n(3.3)\n\nSince Gz is a positive quadratic form we have thus shown that G must lie inside a moduli\ndependent ellipsoid in CN +1 . Let us use this to derive a restriction on the integer valued\nvectors F and H. If we collect these into a (2N + 2)-dimensional vector N\u0302 = (F, H) we\nhave\n1\n\u1e20 * Gz * GT = N\u0302 * (G\u03c4 \u2297 Gz ) * N\u0302 T\n(3.4)\nhF(3) , H(3) i =\n2 Im \u03c4\nwhere G\u03c4 is proportional to the metric on a torus with complex structure \u03c4 :\n!\n1\n1 \u2212Re \u03c4\nG\u03c4 =\n.\n(3.5)\n2Im \u03c4 \u2212Re \u03c4 |\u03c4 |2\nThus, the integer vector N\u0302 must lie within an ellipsoid in R2N +2 whose dimensions are\ngiven by the (z, \u03c4 )-dependent eigenvalues \u039bi of the matrix G\u03c4 \u2297 Gz . It is now simple to\nformulate the no-go result of [31]. Any region R \u2282 C of (\u03c4, z)-space for which the \u039bi are\nbounded from below by some positive number, can support only a finite number of vacua.\nTo see this, suppose that \u039bi (z, \u03c4 ) > \u000f for all (z, \u03c4 ) and i. Then all admissible N\u0302 lie within\na ball of radius squared r2 = Lmax /\u000f. These are of course finitely many.\nIt is also immediately clear how to evade this no-go result. Infinite series of vacua can\noccur only if their location in C approaches a point where the matrix G\u03c4 \u2297 Gz develops a\nnull eigenvector. Points where this happens are referred to as D-limits.\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\f3.2\n\nD-limits\n\nSince the eigenvalues of a product matrix is the product of the eigenvalues of the factors,\na D-limit can arise in two ways. Either G\u03c4 or Gz can degenerate. In the first case, using\nS-duality to restrict \u03c4 to lie in the standard fundamental domain of the torus moduli space,\nthe only locus where G\u03c4 degenerates is as Im \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e. This limit corresponds to a decoupling\nlimit, and the null eigenvector has only RR-flux.\nThe other option is that Gz degenerates. To find out when this happens we need to\ncompute this matrix in terms of the periods. Using the expression for (A(3) , B(3) ) given in\nEq. (2.18) of [44] some simple algebra yields\nh\ni\nA * Gz * B T = 2eK Re (A * \u03a0)(\u03a0\u2020 * B T ) + g i\uf6be\u0304 (A * Di \u03a0)(D\u0304\uf6be\u0304 \u03a0\u2020 * B T )\n(3.6)\nso that\nh\ni\nGz = 2eK Re \u03a0 \u03a0\u2020 + g i\uf6be\u0304 Di \u03a0 D\u0304\uf6be\u0304 \u03a0\u2020 .\n\n(3.7)\n\nThis matrix can be computed straightforwardly when the periods \u03a0I are known. In section\n4 we shall do this for the large complex structure and conifold limits.\n3.3\n\nD-limits and F-theory\n\nFlux compactifications of Type IIB string theory can be embedded in the more general\nframework of F-theory compactified on elliptic Calabi-Yau fourfolds, see e.g. [39]. On\nthe one hand, F-theory geometrizes the SL(2, Z) self-duality of type IIB string theory.\nFor generic points in moduli space, F-theory models have no interpretation in terms of\nperturbative type IIB string theory due to the presence of various types of (p, q)-branes. In\nSen's weak coupling limit [45], however, F-theory reduces to weakly coupled type IIB string\ntheory compactified on Calabi-Yau orientifolds with O7-planes and D7-branes. In F-theory,\nthe closed string moduli are unified with the open string moduli in the moduli space of\nthe elliptic Calabi-Yau manifold. On the other hand, F-theory can be obtained as a limit\nof M-theory compactifications on elliptic Calabi-Yau manifolds by collapsing the elliptic\nfibre. As M-theory contains a four-form field strenght, one can introduce four-form fluxes\nG(4) . These must have one leg in the elliptic fibre in order not to spoil Lorentz invariance\n[46]. In Sen's weak coupling limit, the four-form fluxes G(4) on the M-theory side encode\nboth the three-form flux G(3) as well as (abelian) two-form fluxes F(2) on D7-branes on the\ntype IIB side.\nThe analysis of the last section can be carried over to this case: In the absence of\nO3-planes, the condition for the cancellation of the D3-brane tadpole is\nZ\n\u03c7(CY4 ) 1\n\u2212\nG \u2227 G(4) = ND3 .\n(3.8)\n24\n2 CY4 (4)\nHere, \u03c7(CY4 ) denotes the Euler characteristic of the elliptic Calabi\u2013Yau fourfold.\nAs shown in [47], the equations of motion enforce that\n\u2217 G(4) = G(4) ,\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n(3.9)\n\n\fso that\n1\n2\n\nZ\nG(4) \u2227 G(4)\nCY4\n\n1\n=\n2\n\nZ\nG(4) \u2227 \u2217G(4) \u2265 0 .\n\n(3.10)\n\nCY4\n\nAs before, infinite sequences of flux vacua can only exist in a limit in which this positive\ndefinite form develops a zero eigenvector.\n\n4\n\nSeries in type IIB D-limits\n\nIn this section we analyse the possibility of infinite sequences in various D-limits in type IIB\ncompactifications. We treat in turn the large complex structure limit, decoupling limits and\nthe conifold limit. We assume all the time that only one of these special loci is approached,\ni.e., we do not treat a simultaneous decoupling and LCS limit. In all cases we find that no\ninfinite sequences of ISD vacua are possible.\n4.1\n\nSeries around a large complex structure point\n\nAn example of a D-limit that is ubiquitous in Calabi\u2013Yau moduli spaces is the large complex\nstructure point. Since the series of [30] seem to accumulate at this point it is natural to\ninvestigate whether such series can continue indefinitely or not. We study therefore oneparameter models with an LCS point and use the no-go results of Ashok and Douglas. The\ncomplex structure modulus is conventionally denoted by t = t1 + it2 with t1,2 \u2208 R and the\nLCS point is at t2 \u2192 \u221e. For a one-parameter model, the period vector takes the following\ngeneral form around the LCS point\n\uf8eb \uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u03a03\n\u03b13 t3 + \u03b33 t + i\u03b43\n\uf8ec\u03a0 \uf8f7 \uf8ec \u03b2 t2 + \u03b3 t + \u03b4 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec 2\uf8f7 \uf8ec 2\n2\n2\uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\u223c\uf8ec\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8ed\u03a01 \uf8f8 \uf8ed\n\uf8f8\nt\n\u03a00\n1\n\n(4.1)\n\nUsing Eqs. (3.7), (2.5), the definition gi\uf6be\u0304 = \u2202i \u2202\uf6be\u0304 K, and the expansion of the periods now\nallows for a straightforward computation of Gt . The computation is outlined in Appendix\nA, and a generic1 model of our type gives the result\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\na11 t32 + O(t2 ) a12 t2 + O(1/t2 ) a13 t12 + O(1/t32 ) a14 t13 + O(1/t52 )\n2\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n*\na22 t2 + O(1/t2 ) a23 t12 + O(1/t32 ) a24 t13 + O(1/t52 )\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n2\n\uf8f7\nGt = \uf8ec\n*\n*\na33 t12 + O(1/t32 ) a34 t13 + O(1/t52 )\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n2\n1\n5\n*\n*\n*\na44 t3 + O(1/t2 )\n\n(4.2)\n\n2\n\nfor some known constants aij . Here, the entries * in Gt are determined by symmetry. It is\nclear that this matrix develops two null eigenvectors as t2 \u2192 \u221e.\n1\n\nWe assume that two of the expansion coefficients in (4.1) are related as \u03b22 = 3\u03b13 . This is true for all\nmodels in [30] and seems to be a general feature. Treating the case \u03b22 6= 3\u03b13 produces results identical to\nthose presented here.\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\fWe now prove that there are no infinite series of ISD vacua accumulating at the complex\nstructure point for our one-parameter models. Let us begin by noting that the intersection\nmatrix in the basis of (4.1) is anti-diagonal:\nQ03 = \u2212Q12 = \u22121 .\n\n(4.3)\n\nTherefore a flux configuration with F 0 = F 1 = H 0 = H 1 = 0 satisfies\nhF(3) , H(3) i = 0 ,\n\n(4.4)\n\nimplying that for any ISD vacuum corresponding to such fluxes\nN\u0302 * (G\u03c4 \u2297 Gt ) * N\u0302 T = 0 .\n\n(4.5)\n\nSince the matrix Gt is positive definite for any smooth manifold, (4.5) implies that the\ncompactification manifold is singular, i.e., that the vacuum sits exactly at the D-limit. In\nfact, as remarked in [26], the flux potential always has a minimum at the LCS point for such\nflux configurations. What we shall demonstrate below is that this is the only possibility:\nthere are no series for which one of F 0,1 , H 0,1 is nonzero.\nSince we assume that Im \u03c4 stays finite, the essential features can be deduced from the\nstructure of Gt . We prove first the following statement. Suppose {Nn = (Nn0 , Nn1 , Nn2 , Nn3 )}\nis a series of integer four-vectors and that {tn } is a series of points in complex structure\nmoduli space such that\nlim Im tn = \u221e\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nlim Nn * Gtn * NnT \u2261 lim kNn k2t 6= \u221e .\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n(4.6)\n\nThen Nn0 = Nn1 = 0 for n sufficiently large. We prove this by contradiction. To reduce\nclutter, let us from now on suppress the subscript on t and N . Suppose first that N 0 is\nnon-zero, without loss of generality let N 0 = 1 and assume that (4.6) holds. Denote the\neigenvectors and (positive) eigenvalues of the matrix (4.2) by wi and \u03bbi , respectively. The\nscalar product kN k2t can be expanded in this eigenbasis:\nkN k2t\n\n=\n\n4\nX\n\n|N * wi (t)|2 \u03bbi (t) .\n\n(4.7)\n\ni=1\n\nSince all of the terms in this expression are positive, all of them must stay finite\nlimit t2 \u2192 \u221e. Expanding in t2 , the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are given by\n\u0001\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0001\n\u0001\n,\n\u03bb1 = a11 t32 + O (t2 ) ,\nw1T = 1, O t\u22122\n, O t\u22124\n, O t\u22126\n2\n2\n2\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\u0003\n\u0001\n\u0002\n, 1, O t\u22122\n, O t\u22124\n,\n\u03bb2 = a22 t2 + O t\u22121\n,\nw2T = O t\u22122\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u0001\n\u0002\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\u0003\na33\n\u03bb3 =\n+ O t\u22122\n,\nw3T = O t\u22124\n, O t\u22122\n, 1, O t\u22122\n,\n2\n2\n2\n2\nt2\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001 \u0003\n\u0001\n\u0002\na44\n, O t\u22124\n, O t\u22122\n,1 .\n\u03bb4 = 3 + O t\u22125\n,\nw4T = O t\u22126\n2\n2\n2\n2\nt2\n\u0001\nThe first eigenvalue grows as \u03bb1 \u223c t32 . Therefore we must have |N * w1 |2 \u223c O t\u22123\n.\n2\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u22123/2\n= N * w1 = 1 + N 1 O t\u22122\n+ N 2 O t\u22124\n+ N 3 O t\u22126\n.\nO t2\n2\n2\n2\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\nin the\n\n(4.8)\nHence\n(4.9)\n\n\fThis can happen only if at least one of the N i diverges. It is also clear that this must\nhappen in order for N to approach one of the zero eigenvectors of Gt . What is needed is\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nN 1 = P t22 + o t22 ,\nN 2 = Q t42 + o t42 ,\nN 3 = R t62 + o t62\n(4.10)\nwhere, e.g., o(t22 ) denotes terms that grows slower than t22 and P , Q and R are appropriately\nchosen constants. Consider now the term in (4.7) proportional to \u03bb4 . We obtain\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nN * w4 = O t\u22126\n+ N 1 O t\u22124\n+ N 2 O t\u22122\n+ N 3 \u223c R t62\n(4.11)\n2\n2\n2\nHence |N * w4 |2 \u03bb4 \u223c R2 t92 , and R must vanish. Considering now in order the terms\nproportional to \u03bb3 and \u03bb2 demonstrates in complete parallel that also Q and P must be\nzero. This is, however, incompatible with (4.9), and we have reached a contradiction. We\nhave thus proved that N 0 = 0. Assuming now a flux of the form N = (0, 1, N 2 , N 3 ) and\ngoing through an almost identical argument demonstrates N 1 = 0.\nTo complete the argument we now consider a series of integer eight-vector N\u0302n =\n(Fn , Hn ) and assume that\nN\u0302 * G\u03c4 \u2297 Gt * N\u0302 T\n(4.12)\nstays finite as the LCS point is approached. (Again we suppress the index on N\u0302 and t.)\nWe furthermore assume that \u03c4 = \u03c41 + i\u03c42 lies in the standard fundamental domain |\u03c4 | \u2265 1,\n|\u03c41 | \u2264 1/2. Since we, by assumption, do not approach a decoupling limit, the whole series\nfulfils \u03c42 \u2264 M for some number M . This means that the eigenvalues \u03bc1,2 of the matrix\n(3.5) are bounded from below. The eigenvalues and orthonormal eigenvectors v1,2 are\n!\n\u0014\n\u0015\nq\nF\n1\nv\n2\n2\n1,2\n\u03bc1,2 =\n.\n(4.13)\n1 + |\u03c4 | \u00b1 (1 \u2212 |\u03c4 |2 ) + 4\u03c412 ,\nv1,2 =\nH\n4\u03c42\nv1,2\nThe only property of v1,2 important to us presently is their orthonormality.

This in turn implies that there is no vacuum, except the\nsingular one located exactly at the LCS point.\n4.2\n\nSeries in decoupling limits\n\nLet us now, in a very similar manner, prove that there can be no sequences of ISD vacua\nconverging to a decoupling limit. We consider some flux compactification on a Calabi\u2013Yau\nwhose matrix Gz has eigenvalues and vectors \u03bbj and wj . (Note that, in this subsection, we\ndo not make any assumptions concerning the dimensionality b3 of the vectors wj , F and\nH.)\nAny sequence of ISD vacua must, of course, still have a finite constant value for the\nquantity in Eq. (4.15), and each of the terms in that equation must thus be finite. This time\nhowever, we assume that the eigenvalues \u03bbj are bounded from below, and that \u03c42 \u2192 \u221e.\nThe quantities \u000fij therefore must satisfy\n\u221a\n\u000fij = (viF F + viH H) * wj = O(1/ \u03bci ) .\n\n(4.20)\n\nUsing the fact that the wj , as eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix, are orthonormal, it is\npossible to invert the above relation to yield\n\u221a\nviF F + viH H = O(1/ \u03bci ) .\n\n(4.21)\n\nIn the decoupling limit the eigenvectors vi and eigenvalues \u03bci are given by\n\u03bc1 =\n\n\u03c42 \u03c412\n+\n+ ... ,\n2\n\u03c42\n\n\u03bc2 =\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u03c4 (\u03c4 2 \u22121)\n+ ...\n\u2212 \u03c4\u03c421 + 1 \u03c414\n2\n\uf8f8,\nv1 = \uf8ed\n\u03c42\n1 \u2212 2\u03c4 41+...\n2\n\n1\n\u03c42\n\u2212 13 + . . . ,\n2\u03c42 \u03c42\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03c412\n+ ...\n2\u03c424\n\uf8f8\n\u03c41 (\u03c412 \u22121)\n+\n.\n.\n.\n4\n\u03c42\n\n1\u2212\n\nv2 = \uf8ed \u03c4\n\n1\n\u03c42\n\n\u2212\n\n(4.22)\n\uf8f6\n.\n\n(4.23)\n\nTherefore Eq.

This means that the imaginary part of \u03c4 goes to zero,\nwhich is S-dual to a decoupling limit. Therefore, as in the LCS case, there are no infinite\nsequences of vacua with finite (and nonzero) string coupling.\n4.4\n\nThe two-paramter model M(86,2)\n\nUntil now we have studied D-limits in the complex structure and axio-dilaton moduli spaces\nof a family of one-parameter Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds.

The only exception\nis again the singular vacuum located exactly at the LCS point.\n\n5\n\nD-limits and infinite flux series for F-theory on K3 \u00d7 K3\n\nThe simplest non-trivial flux compactifications apart from toroidal orbifolds are compactifications of type IIB string theory on the orientifold K3 \u00d7 T 2 /Z2 . These models contain\nfour orientifold planes and 16 D7-branes which are points in T 2 /Z2 and fill out the entire\nK3 as well as the four non-compact directions.\nAlternatively, these compactifications can be described as F-theory on K3 \u00d7 K3. This\ndescription not only allows for an elegant treatment of IIB flux compactifications on the\norientifold K3 \u00d7 T 2 /Z2 , but also naturally includes two-form fluxes on the D7-branes.\nAs shown by Aspinwall and Kallosh [43], the number of supersymmetric vacua of such\ncompactifications is finite, i.e. there can be no infinite flux series in these models.\nIn this section, we discuss this result from the perspective of D-limits. We are able to\nfind D-limits as well as associate infinite flux sequences on K3, so that the result of [43]\nimplies that all but finitely many of the corresponding solutions are actually equivalent by\nautomorphism of the lattice H 2 (K3, Z). We demonstrate this in a simple example.\nCompactifications of type IIB string theory on K3 \u00d7 T 2 /Z2 with G3 flux have also\nbeen considered in [50]. They show how to find an infinite sequence of fluxes which solves\nall of the supersymmetry conditions except for primitivity. In general, imaginary selfduality (ISD) does not imply supersymmetry. In the present case, however, one can show\nthat the complex structure of K3 may always be chosen such that (for fixed metric) the\nsupersymmetry constraints are satisfied for any ISD solution. Hence their sequence also\nbreaks imaginary self-duality. Therefore, we can not treat the flux series of [50] as a D-limit\nin the sense introduced.\n\n\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n\f5.1\n\nF-theory with G(4) flux on K3 \u00d7 K3\n\nIn compactifications of F-theory on the fourfold K3 \u00d7 K3 3 , one can switch on four-form\nfluxes G(4) which are integrally quantized. They can be written as\nG(4) = G\u03bc\u03bd \u03b7\u03bc \u2227 \u03b7\u0303\u03bd .\n\n(5.1)\n\nHere \u03b7\u03bc and \u03b7\u0303\u03bd are integral two-forms on the two K3s. We will think of the matrix G\u03bc\u03bd as\nthe components of a vector in H 2 (K3, Z) \u2297 H 2 (K3, Z) and simply write G in the following.\nThe scalar potential induced by the fluxes can stabilize both complex structure as well\nas K\u00e4hler moduli of K3 \u00d7 K3 (except for the volumes of the two K3s). The vacua of\nthese models were analysed in [43, 51]. See also [50, 52] for an analysis from the type IIB\nperspective.\nIt can be shown that the scalar potential is positive definite and can be written as [51]\nZ\n1\nG \u2227 (\u2217G(4) \u2212 G(4) ) .\n(5.2)\nV =\n2 K3\u00d7K3 (4)\nAs G(4) is forced to be self-dual by the equations of motion, their solutions correspond to\nMinkowski minima of the effective potential.\nFor K3 \u00d7 K3, the tadpole condition (3.8) reads\nZ\n1\nG \u2227 G(4) + ND3 = 24 ,\n(5.3)\n2 Y4 (4)\nwhich can be rewritten as\n1\n24 = ND3 +\n2\n\nZ\nG(4) \u2227 G(4)\nK3\u00d7K3\n\n1\n= ND3 +\n2\n\nZ\nG(4) \u2227 \u2217G(4) ,\n\n(5.4)\n\nK3\u00d7K3\n\nwhich is manifestly positive.

For a more thorough treatment, see e.g. [53, 54].\nIn two complex dimensions there is just one non-trivial compact Calabi\u2013Yau manifold:\nK3. The metric deriving from the natural inner product on the 22-dimensional space\nH 2 (K3):\nZ\n\u03b7\u03bc \u2227 \u03b7\u03bd ,\n\nM\u03bc\u03bd =\n\n(5.8)\n\nK3\n\nhas signature (3, 19). The vector space H 2 (K3) contains the lattice H 2 (K3, Z), the elements of which are Poincar\u00e9 dual to curves in K3. This lattice can be written as\nH 2 (K3, Z) = \u2212E8\u22952 \u2295 U \u22953 ,\n\n(5.9)\n\nwhere E8 denotes the root lattice of E8 and U is the hyperbolic lattice. Embedded in a\nvector space with orthonormal basis EI , the root lattice of E8 is given by vectors\nX\nqI EI ,\n(5.10)\nI\n\nP\nwhere the qI have to be all integer or all half-integer and fulfill the relations I=1,...,8 qI \u2208\n2Z. The lattice U \u22953 is spanned by integral multiples of ei , ej which have the intersections\nei * ej = \u03b4ij\n\nei * ej = 0\n\nei * ej = 0 .\n\n(5.11)\n\nThe inner product between integral two-forms has a geometric interpretation as the intersection of the dual curves. As the K3 surface has a trivial canonical bundle, the selfintersection number of a curve, i.e. the intersection between two homologous curves, translates to its genus by using the adjunction formula. Denoting the curve dual to the integral\ntwo-form \u03b7C by C one obtains\nZ\n\u03b7C \u2227 \u03b7C = C \u2229 C = \u2212\u03c7(C) = \u22122 + 2g(C) .\n(5.12)\nK3\n\nThe geometric moduli space of K3 is the set of all oriented positive-norm three-planes \u03a3\nin H 2 (K3) modulo automorphisms of the lattice H 2 (K3, Z) in O+ (3, 19) [53, 55]. The\ngroup O+ (3, 19) is the component of the orthogonal group which leaves the orientation of\n\u03a3 invariant.\nWe span \u03a3 using three orthonormal vectors \u03c9i :\n\u03c9i * \u03c9j = \u03b4ij .\n\n(5.13)\n\nNote that this description leaves an SO(3) symmetry, rotating the \u03c9i into one another. We\ncan construct the K\u00e4hler form J and the holomorphic two-form \u03a9 of K3 using the vectors\n\u03c9i :\n\u221a\n\u03a9 = \u03c91 + i\u03c92\nJ = V \u03c93 ,\n(5.14)\n\n\u2013 18 \u2013\n\n\fwhere we have denoted the volume of K3 by V . It is important to note that a choice\nof \u03a3 determines the metric of K3 (up to the overall volume), but does not completely\ndetermine the complex structure. We still may rotate the \u03c9i inside \u03a3 or equivalently\nchange the definition in (5.14). For a fixed complex structure, the lattice of integral cycles\nof K3 which are orthogonal to \u03a9 is the Picard lattice.\nAny two-form H \u2208 H 2 (K3) can be decomposed into a piece parallel and a piece\nperpendicular to \u03a3:\nH = Hk + H\u22a5 .\n(5.15)\nThe action of the Hodge-\u2217 operation on K3 then takes the simple form\n\u2217 H = \u2217Hk + \u2217H\u22a5 = Hk \u2212 H\u22a5 .\n\n(5.16)\n\nThe K3 moduli space naturally includes loci over which the K3 surface develops ADE\nsingularities. Whenever there are elements \u03b3i \u2208 H 2 (K3, Z) with \u03b3i * \u03b3i = \u22122 that are\northogonal to \u03a3, the dual spheres collapse to produce an ADE singularity. Loci where this\noccurs are at a finite distance in moduli space from any generic smooth K3.\n5.3\n\nD-limits and G\u03a3\n\nLet us now see if G\u03a3 can degenerate so that we find a D-limit. As before, we denote the\nvector of coefficients that is obtained when an integral two-form G(2) is expanded in some\nbasis \u03b7\u03bc of H 2 (K3) by g. In order to facilitate the discussion of flux quantization we choose\nthis basis to be integral, i.e. the vectors \u03b7\u03bc are elements of the lattice H 2 (K3, Z).\nUsing this basis,\n\u03c9i = \u03c9i\u03bc \u03b7\u03bc ,\n\nG(2) = g \u03bc \u03b7\u03bc .\n\n(5.17)\n\nWe can decompose\nG(2) = G(2)k + G(2)\u22a5 =\n\nXZ\ni\n\n(\u03c9i \u2227 G(2) ) \u03c9i + G(2) \u2212\n\nXZ\n\nK3\n\ni\n\n(\u03c9i \u2227 G(2) )\u03c9i .\n\n(5.18)\n\nK3\n\nHence\n!\n\u2217G(2) = G(2)k \u2212 G(2)\u22a5 =\n\n2M\u03bc\u03bd\n\nX\n\n\u03c9i\u03c1 \u03c9i\u03bc\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b4\u03bd\u03c1\n\ng \u03bd \u03b7\u03c1 .\n\n(5.19)\n\ni\n\nDefining the projector\n\u0393\u03c1\u03bd \u2261\n\nX\n\n\u03c9i\u03c1 \u03c9i\u03bc M\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u03932 = \u0393 ,\n\n(5.20)\n\ni\n\nwhich projects any form onto its components parallel to \u03a3, we obtain\nG\u03a3 = M (2\u0393 \u2212 1) .\n\n(5.21)\n\nAs the inner product (5.7) is positive definite for any smooth K3 surface, it follows that\nthe metric in (5.21) has the same property. It can only degenerate in a limit in moduli\nspace in which the K3 surface becomes singular. Let us first consider the aforementioned\n\n\u2013 19 \u2013\n\n\fADE singularities. They occur when we rotate the three-plane \u03a3 such that it becomes\northogonal to specific lattice vectors of H 2 (K3, Z) with respect to the metric (5.8). The\nexpression we have derived for G\u03a3 , however, does not at all depend on the location of\n\u03a3 relative to the lattice H 2 (K3, Z). Hence the metric G\u03a3 can not degenerate when we\napproach a locus in moduli space for which the K3 surface has an ADE singularity. Note\nalso that these singularities occur at finite distance in moduli space, i.e. the naturally lie\ninside the moduli space. Another kind of singularity occurs when we rotate \u03a3 towards a\nlight-like direction in H 2 (K3). In the following, we shall investigate such a limit and show\nthat it indeed gives rise to a degeneration of G\u03a3 .\nA well-known example of such a limit is the F-theory limit of a compactification of Mtheory on an elliptically fibered K3. In this limit, the volume of the T 2 fibre is taken to zero,\nwhich corresponds to rotating the K\u00e4hler form towards the light cone in H 2 (K3) [56]. Just\nas in the case of the large complex structure limit, this limit is dual to a decompactification\nlimit which takes place on the type IIB/F-theory side. Furthermore, it can be shown that\nthis limit is at infinite distance in moduli space [51].\nAn example\nTo show that rotating \u03a3 towards the light cone constitutes a D-limit, we consider a simple\nexample. For ease of exposition, we keep the three-plane \u03a3 in a four-dimensional subspace\nspanned by\nd1 = e1 + e1 ,\n\nd2 = e2 + e2 ,\n\nd3 = e3 + e3 ,\n\nd4 = e1 \u2212 e1 .\n\n(5.22)\n\nNote that the intersection form is diagonal in terms of the di : M = diag(2, 2, 2, \u22122). In\nthis basis, we choose \u03a3 to be spanned by the orthonormal vectors\n1\n\u03c91 (n) = \u221a (1, 0, n, n),\n2\n\n1\n\u03c92 (n) = \u221a (0, 1, 0, 0),\n2\n\nThe matrix G\u03a3 = M (2\u0393 \u2212 1) is\n\uf8eb 1+3n2\n\n0\n\uf8ec 0 1\n\uf8ec\nG\u03a3 = 2 \uf8ec 2n2\n\uf8ed 1+n2 0\n\u22122n 0\n1+n2\n\n\u03c93 (n) = \u221a\n\n1\n(n, 0, \u22121, 0) .\n2 + 2n2\n(5.23)\n\n2n2\n1+n2\n\n\uf8f6\n\u22122n\n0\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n.\n1\n2 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\u22121 + 2(n2 + 1+n\n)\n\u22122n\n2\n\u22122n2\n1 + 2n2\n\n(5.24)\n\nIts eigenvalues are given by\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb2 = 2 ,\n\n\u03bb3 = 2 + 4n2 \u2212 4\n\np\nn2 + n 4 ,\n\n\u03bb4 = 2 + 4n2 + 4\n\np\nn2 + n4 .\n\nIn the limit n \u2192 \u221e we may approximate\np\n1\n1\nn2 + n4 = n2 + \u2212 2 + O(n\u22124 ) .\n2 8n\n\n(5.25)\n\n(5.26)\n\nIn this limit we hence find that \u03bb3 goes to zero and \u03bb4 goes to infinity:\n\u03bb3 \u223c\n\n1\n2n2\n\n\u03bb4 \u223c 8n2 .\n\n\u2013 20 \u2013\n\n(5.27)\n\n\fThe eigenvector v3 associated with \u03bb3 is\n\uf8eb\n\n\u221a\n\u2212n3 +n(\u22121+ n2 +n4 )\n\u221a\n(1+n2 )(n2 \u2212 n2 +n4 )\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nn\u22121\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \uf8ec 0 \uf8f7\nv3 = \uf8ec n2 1+n2 \u2212\u221an2 +n4 \uf8f7 \u2212\nn \u2192 \u221e\uf8ec\n\uf8f7.\n) \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\u2212 (\n\uf8ed 1 \uf8f8\n\uf8ed (1+n2 )(n2 \u2212\u221an2 +n4 ) \uf8f8\n1\n1\n\n(5.28)\n\nHence we find a D-limit in which the metric degenerates in the direction of \u03c91 . Note that\nthis is precisely the direction of \u03a3 which we are rotating towards the light-cone.\nLet us now use this example to construct a flux series. The flux vector\ng = (1, 0, n, n, 0, 0, ...) \u223c nv3 ,\n\n(5.29)\n\nis properly quantized for any integer n. For large values of n we have that\ng * G \u03a3 * g T \u223c n2\n\n1\n= const .\nn2\n\n(5.30)\n\nHence the eigenvalue of v3 goes to zero fast enough to allow for an infinite sequence of\nintegral flux vectors for which g * G\u03a3 * g T approaches a constant in the D-limit.\n5.4\n\nInfinite series and automorphisms of H 2 (K3, Z)\n\nTo put the example of the last section to work we set\n\u03a9(n) = \u03c91 (n) + i\u03c92\n\n(5.31)\n\n\u03a9\u0303 = \u03c9\u03031 + i\u03c9\u03032 ,\n\n(5.32)\n\nwith \u03c9i (n) given by (5.23). A properly quantized flux series that obeys the supersymmetry\nconditions (and equations of motion) is given by [43]\n\u221a\nG(4) (n) = 2 (\u03c91 (n) \u2227 \u03c9\u03031 + \u03c92 \u2227 \u03c9\u03032 ) .\n(5.33)\nThe flux-induced D3 tadpole is\nZ\n1\nG (n) \u2227 G(4) (n) = 2 ,\n2 K3\u00d7K3 (4)\n\n(5.34)\n\nfor any n. For the K\u00e4hler form J we can choose any positive norm two-form in H 2 (K3)\nwhich is orthogonal to \u03a9. Setting J = \u03c93 (n) demonstrates that such a J can always be\nfound.\nIn [43], it was shown that there can only be a finite number of supersymmetric flux\nvacua in compactifications on K3 \u00d7 K3. In order to make contact with our results, we\nreview their main results. As supersymmetry demands that the flux is of type (2, 2) and\nprimitive, one can write\n\u0010\n\u0011\n \u0304 + X \u03c8 \u2227 \u03c8 \u0303 ,\nG = Re c \u03a9 \u2227 \u03a9\u0303\n(5.35)\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\n\u2013 21 \u2013\n\n\fwhere c is a parameter that has to be chosen appropriately for flux quantization and \u03c8\u03b1 , \u03c8 \u0303\u03b1\nare integral primitive (1, 1) forms on the respective K3 surfaces. They show that if only\nthe first term is present, as is the case for our example, the complex structure moduli of the\ntwo K3 surfaces, i.e. \u03a9 and \u03a9\u0303, are completely fixed. Furthermore, they are fixed such that\nthe Picard lattice of the corresponding K3 surfaces is of maximal rank, i.e. \u03a9 sits inside\na two-dimensional lattice \u03a5 \u2282 H 2 (K3, Z). Such K3 surfaces, which have been dubbed4\n'attractive', can be classified through the lattice \u03a5. It turns out that only a finite number\nof attractive K3 surfaces can satisfy the tadpole condition (5.3). When the second term\nin (5.35) is also present, the K3 ceases to be attractive. Its contribution to the tadpole is,\nhowever, always positive definite. Hence there can be only a finite number of flux choices\nthat admit supersymmetric flux vacua and satisfy the tadpole condition for F-theory on\nK3 \u00d7 K3.\nSupersymmetry only forces G(4) to be primitive, but does not fix the K\u00e4hler moduli.\nNon-perturbative effects, however, give rise to an effective potential that can fix all K\u00e4hler\nmoduli. As the effective potential is determined once fluxes (and hence the complex structure) are given, it follows that there is only a finite number of supersymmetric stable flux\nvacua for F-theory on K3 \u00d7 K3. In case both terms in (5.35) are non-zero, some of the\ninstantons that stabilize the K\u00e4hler moduli can be obstructed, so that not all moduli are\nstabilized.\nThe results of [43] indicate that all but a finite number of the vacua of the series we\nhave constructed before must actually be equivalent. Note that for our series, only the first\nterm in (5.35) is present. Once we specify G in terms of \u03a9, the K\u00e4hler form is therefore\ndetermined completely. Hence we have to show that there is an automorphism of H(K3, Z)\nwhich identifies all but a finite number of the sub-lattices spanned by the \u03a9(n). To find\nthis automorphism, we write \u03c91 (n) and \u03c92 in terms of a basis for the lattice U \u22953 :\n\u03c91 (n) = e1 (1 + n) + ne3 + e1 (1 \u2212 n) + ne3 ,\n\u03c92 = e2 + e2 .\n\n(5.36)\n(5.37)\n\nIndeed, there is an automorphism of H 2 (K3, Z) which identifies all of the solution in\nour series. It is given by\ne1 7\u2192 \u00ea1 = (1 + n)e1 + ne3\n\ne1 7\u2192 \u00ea1 = (1 \u2212 n)e1 + ne3\n\ne2 7\u2192 \u00ea2 = \u2212e2\n\ne2 7\u2192 \u00ea2 = \u2212e2\n\ne3 7\u2192 \u00ea3 = ne1 + (n \u2212 1)e3\n\ne3 7\u2192 \u00ea3 = ne1 \u2212 (1 + n)e3 .\n\n(5.38)\n\nwith all other elements unchanged. It maps\n\u03c91 (0) = e1 + e1 7\u2192 \u00ea1 + \u00ea1 = \u03c91 (n) ,\n\u03c92 7\u2192 \u2212\u03c92 .\n4\n\n(5.39)\n(5.40)\n\nThey have also been referred to as 'singular' K3 surfaces, even though they can be perfectly smooth\nmanifolds. Hence we follow [43] in calling them 'attractive'.\n\n\u2013 22 \u2013\n\n\fHence this automorphism identifies the holomorphic two-forms and consequently also the\nfluxes of our series of K3 surfaces. Furthermore, it gives rise to an orientation preserving5\nmap of \u03a3 to itself. Thus it is induced from a diffeomorphism of K3 [55], so that all of the\nsolutions in our series should be considered equivalent.\nOur example is, of course, very simple in that it only rotates \u03a9 towards the light cone in\nthe lattice U \u22953 . Even though examples of D-limits and infinite flux series employing the E8\nlattices can be constructed in a straightforward fashion, the corresponding automorphisms\nare harder to find. Showing that such automorphisms exist for any D-limit would hence\nconstitute an alternative proof of the finiteness of the number of supersymmetric flux vacua\non K3 \u00d7 K3. As the self-duality condition on G4 follows from the equations of motion but\ndoes not require supersymmetry, one could then try to prove a similar theorem also for\nnon-supersymmetric vacua.\nOne can turn this logic around and construct automorphism of K3 by studying Dlimits. By the result of [43], only a finite number of solutions in any infinite sequence of\nsupersymmetric vacua can be different. Hence there must be corresponding automorphisms\nin O+ (3, 19) which identify all but a finite number of the solutions. It would be interesting\nto use this approach to study the diffeomorphism group of K3 surfaces.\nAs the self-duality condition also holds without supersymmetry, infinite sequences can\nalso only occur in D-limits in this case. With a sufficient understanding of the automorphisms of K3 it hence seems possible to use the D-limit approach to study the existence\nof infinite sequences of non-supersymmetric solutions.\n\n6\n\nThe models of Ahlqvist et al.\n\nIn this section we take a closer look at a few examples of sequences of minima that converge\nto the LCS point, and that were first reported on in [30]. These minima have vanishing\nscalar potential and hence fulfill the ISD condition. A question left open in this reference\nwas whether these series are infinite. Here we use the LCS expansions of the periods to\nshow that there are more minima in the series than those reported in [30], but that the\nminima eventually break the ISD condition and the series terminate in agreement with\nthe discussion in section 4.1. After a brief description of the method we used to find the\nminima, we present two examples of sequences of minima.\nTo speed up the numerical calculation of the potential, we proceed as follows. We\nfirst compute the periods and their derivatives on a grid in the complex structure modulus\nplane. This computation is performed using the built-in Meijer functions of Maple for the\nfull periods, and using Matlab for the LCS expansions of the periods. We then feed these\nperiods into Matlab where the superpotential, K\u00e4hler and scalar potentials are computed.\nWe also use Matlab to find the minima of the potential, and determine their position and\nminimum value of the potential.\nSince the minima in the series approach the LCS point, the LCS expansion of the\nperiods provides a good and computationally cheap approximation of the features of the\n5\n\nNote that this is not the case if we leave e2 and e2 invariant.\n\n\u2013 23 \u2013\n\n\f20\n\nV\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n0.5\n0.5\n0\n\nIm(z)\n\n0\n\u00ef0.5\n\n\u00ef0.5\n\nRe(z)\n\n20\n\nVLCS\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n0.5\n0.5\n0\n\nIm(z)\n\n0\n\u00ef0.5\n\n\u00ef0.5\n\nRe(z)\n\nFigure 1. The scalar potential for the complex structure modulus z of the Mirror Quintic with\nNSNS flux H = (\u22122, \u22124, \u221233, 0) and RR flux F = (3, \u221218, 9, \u22121). The potential has already been\nminimized with respect to the axio-dilaton \u03c4 , so the minimum shown is a minimum for both z and \u03c4 .\nThe first panel shows the potential calculated with periods calculated with the full Meijer functions,\nwhereas the second potential is calculated with the LCS expansions of the periods. As can be seen\nfrom the figures, the LCS expansions are enough to reproduce the features of this minimum.\n\nminima closest to this point. An illustration of this is shown in the figures 1 and 2,\nwhere the Mirror Quintic potential for the flux configuration H = (\u22122, \u22124, \u221233, 0) and\nF = (3, \u221218, 9, \u22121) is plotted using both the full Meijer functions and the LCS expansions.\nAs can be seen from the figures, the two potentials are very similar; in particular the\nlocation and value of the potential in the minimum agree to a good degree. Consequently,\nthe LCS expansions determine the features of minima to a good approximation at least for\n|z| < 0.2.\nGiven that the periods are computed on a grid, the position of a minimum of the\n\n\u2013 24 \u2013\n\n\f1.2\n\n1.1\n\n0.6\n\n1.1\n\n1.1\n\n0.2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0.9\n\nIm(z)\n\n0.4\n\n1\n\u00ef0.2\n\n1\n1\n\n\u00ef0.4\n\n1\n1.1\n\n\u00ef0.4\n\n\u00ef0.2\n\n0\n\n1.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nRe(z)\nFigure 2.

The\nred squares indicate minima with negative F 0 , whereas black stars are used for minima with positive F 0 .\n\nthe LCS expansions are simple functions that can easily be computed on more and more\nrefined grids. In figure 3 we show a more detailed picture of the Mirror Quintic minimum\nthat was obtained using the LCS expansions of the periods.\nThus, in order to investigate whether the series of minima reported on in [30] continue\nindefinitely, we use the LCS expansion of the periods. We first compute the potential for a\nflux configuration on a sparse grid, identifying the region in the z-plane where the minimum\nis located. At this stage, we also note if we need to move the branch cut that emerges from\nthe LCS point in order to trace the minimum to another level in the potential.6 We then\nzoom in on the region that should contain a minimum and recompute the potential on a\nnarrow grid around this point. This allows us to compute the location and potential value\nof the minimum to a higher accuracy. We then act on the flux vectors with the conifold\nmonodromy matrices, and repeat the calculations for the next minimum in the series.\nA series of minima on the Mirror Quintic\nUsing the outlined procedure, we reproduce the minima with F 0 = 3...9 in the Mirror\nQuintic series reported on in table 3 and figure 5 of [30]. In addition we find new minima\nwith F 0 = \u221217... \u2212 6 and \u22123...2. We found no minima for the two values F 0 = \u22125, \u22124,\ndespite having studied the downward spiral of the scalar potential until it reaches its lowest\nlevel and turns back up. The z-distribution of the minima in the series is shown in figure\n6\n\nIn some cases, it is necessary to move several steps down in the potential spiral to find the minimum,\nand for some flux values no minimum is found, even at the lowest level of the potential.\n\n\u2013 26 \u2013\n\n\f\u00ef200\n\n9\n\n\u00ef250\n\n8\n\n\u00ef300\n\n6\n\n\u00ef350\n\n5\n\n\u00ef400\n\nV\n\nW\n\n7\n\n4\n\n\u00ef450\n\n3\n\n\u00ef500\n\n2\n\n\u00ef550\n\n1\n\n\u00ef600\n\n0\n\u00ef15\n\n\u00ef10\n\n\u00ef5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n\u00ef650\n\u00ef20\n\n10\n\n\u00ef15\n\n\u00ef10\n\n0\n\n\u00ef5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\nF0\n\nF\n\n8\n7.5\n7\n\nIm(o)\n\n6.5\n6\n5.5\n5\n4.5\n4\n3.5\n\u00ef20\n\n\u00ef15\n\n\u00ef10\n\n\u00ef5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\nF0\n\nFigure 5. Here we show the value of the potential, the superpotential and the imaginary part of\nthe axio-dilaton \u03c4 for the series of Mirror Quintic minima with NSNS flux H = (\u22122, \u22124, \u221233, 0)\nand RR flux F = (F 0 , \u221218, 9, \u22121). As can be seen from the first panel, all minima with positive F 0\nare ISD and have vanishing scalar potential. The value of the superpotential is large and negative\nfor all minima in the series, and the dilaton does not run away to zero or infinity.\n\n4. As can be seen, starting from F 0 = 9 the series of minima approaches the LCS point\nfor decreasing values of F 0 . However, as the by now negative F 0 increases in magnitude,\nthe minima again recede from the LCS point, until they leave the region where the LCS\nexpansion can be trusted. Thus, this series is not infinite.\nAs shown in figure 5, all minima with positive F 0 have vanishing potential in the\nminimum, and fulfill the ISD condition. Conversely, the minima with negative F 0 have\na non-zero potential value. Thereby, this example confirms our general result that the\nseries of minima that converge to the LCS point eventually break the ISD condition, thus\ninducing non-zero F-terms also in the complex structure and axio-dilaton directions.\nFigure 5 also shows the vacuum expectation value for the superpotential for the series\nof minima. Since this is large for all minima, supersymmetry is broken by the K\u00e4hler\nmoduli, which have non-zero F-terms. We note that the tadpole for this series of minima\nis high, so the phenomenological interest of these minima is fairly limited.\nFrom figure 5 we also see that Im\u03c4 does not run away, but stays in the range 4 \u2212 8.\nConsequently, G\u03c4 does not degenerate, and therefore this series of minima does not lie in a\ndecompactification limit of the axio-dilaton part of moduli space.\n\n\u2013 27 \u2013\n\n\f0.05\n\n0\n\nIm(z)\n\n\u00ef0.05\n\n\u00ef0.1\n\n\u00ef0.15\n\n\u00ef0.2\n\n\u00ef0.25\n\u00ef0.05\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0.35\n\n0.4\n\nRe(z)\nFigure 6.

The red squares indicate minima with\nnegative F 0 , whereas black stars are used for minima with positive F 0 .\n\nA series of minima on Model 12\nThe longest series of minima that was reported on in table 3 and figure 5 of [30] was found\non the one-parameter Calabi\u2013Yau known as Model 12. This series consists of twentynine minima, with NS-NS flux H = (\u22122, \u22124, \u221233, 0) and RR flux F = (F 0 , \u221218, 9, \u22121),\nF 0 = 7, ..., 36. Using the LCS expansions of the periods, we reproduce some minima of this\nseries and extend it to smaller values of F 0 , as shown in figure 6. Just as for the Mirror\nQuintic example, we find that more minima exist in the vicinity of the LCS point, but the\nminima bounce out from the LCS point again as F 0 becomes large and negative. Thus,\nthis series of minima does not continue indefinitely.\nThe value of the potential, superpotential and Im\u03c4 for Model 12 are presented in figure\n7. As can be seen, the features are similar to the Mirror Quintic series. As expected, the\nISD condition is eventually broken for negative values of F 0 , and Im\u03c4 stays finite for the\nwhole series. The superpotential is large and negative also for this series, and the tadpole\nis the same as for the Mirror Quintic series.\n\n7\n\nConclusions and outlook\n\nIn this paper we have extended the no-go result of Ashok and Douglas to include also\nregions around certain D-limits.

The value of the potential, the superpotential and the imaginary part of the axiodilaton \u03c4 for the series of Model 12 minima with NSNS flux H = (\u22122, \u22124, \u221233, 0) and RR flux\nF = (F 0 , \u221218, 9, \u22121) of Model 12. The features of this series of minima closely parallels those of\nthe Mirror Quintic series.\n\nof these can support infinite sequences of ISD vacua. This analysis was performed by\nexplicitly computing a certain positive definite quadratic form defined on the space of flux\nquanta. This form gives the total D3-brane charge originating from three-form flux in the\ncase of an ISD vacuum. By analysing the precise form of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors\nas the various D-limits are approached we demonstrated that no infinite sequences are\npossible. We also extended this analysis to the LCS limit of a two-parameter model, again\nfinding that no infinite sequences exist. Furthermore, we explained how infinite sequences\naccumulating to D-limits in K3 \u00d7 K3 compactifications really correspond to finitely many\nvacua after the automorphism group is taken into account.\nTo complement the analytical results, we studied two of the sequences found by\nAhlqvist et al. [30] numerically. We used expansions around the LCS point to facilitate the computations of the periods, thus making a fine grid possible. The sequences were\nfound to turn close to the LCS point and then be repelled from it, eventually violating the\nISD condition, perfectly in line with the analytical results.\nIn the present work we used fairly pedestrian methods to analyse the structure of the\nquadratic form around various singularities. For this, we needed expansions of the periods\nin the D-limit under consideration. This is in contrast to the statistical analysis, where\n\n\u2013 29 \u2013\n\n\fthe number of vacua is estimated without such detailed understanding of the Calabi\u2013Yau.\nAlthough our method requires more information, it allows us to refine the results of the\nstatistical analysis in the models we consider. It would of course be very interesting to\nformulate more general and transparent conditions on the singularity required for infinite\nsequences. Such a result would be a step towards a more general finiteness theorem.\nAdditionally, two interesting directions of future research would be to investigate\nwhether similar techniques can be applied also in the case of generalized Calabi-Yau manifolds and to analyse how warping corrections affect the results for sequences accumulating\nto a conifold point.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Ralph Blumenhagen, Michael R.
