The absence of any new physics up to very\nhigh scales would imply an unnatural fine tuning of the\nHiggs potential. The hierarchy problem has motivated a\nparadigm for model building whereby a new symmetry\nis introduced at the TeV scale to protect the Higgs from\nquadratic divergences. In such a scenario, naturalness\nis manifested in cancellations between those SM loop\ndiagrams which contribute to the Higgs mass parameter\nand loops involving new physics. When considering the\nnew physics that the LHC may discover it suffices to\nconsider only the \"little hierarchy\" between the scales\nset by the LHC reach and the electroweak scale. For this\npurpose one loop cancellations are sufficient.\nWithin this paradigm the new states that cancel a\ngiven SM loop are related to the corresponding SM\nparticles by the symmetry. The largest contribution\nto the Higgs mass parameter in the SM is from the\ntop quark loop, and therefore there will be new states\nrelated to the top by a symmetry that cancel this loop.\nFor example, if supersymmetry [1] is introduced the\nspectrum includes scalar top partners, t\u0303, to cancel the top\nloop. Alternatively global symmetries, or combinations\nof global and discrete symmetries, may be responsible for\nprotecting the Higgs, such as in little Higgs models [2, 3]\nor twin Higgs models [4, 5]. In these theories new\nfermionic top partners, t0 , are responsible for restoring\nnaturalness.\nIn this class of theories the collider phenomenology\ncrucially depends on whether or not the top partners\ncarry SM color. While in little Higgs theories and\n\nsupersymmetric theories the top partners are indeed\ncharged under SM color, in general this need not be the\ncase. In particular, if the symmetry that protects the\nHiggs mass involves a Z2 symmetry that interchanges\nSM color with a hidden color,\nSU(3)QCD \u2194 SU(3)QCD0\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the symmetry acts on the SM SU(3) gauge fields\nand, more generally, on all colored matter, the cancellation can take place with top partners that are not charged\nunder QCD, but only under QCD0 . The LHC signals\nare drastically different in such a scenario since no new\nparticle is strongly produced.\nOne possibility, realized in the mirror twin Higgs\nmodel [4], is that the top partners are not charged\nunder any of the SM gauge groups. In this paper we\nfocus on the alternative possibility, realized in folded\nsupersymmetry [6], that the new quark partners are\ncharged under QCD0 , but retain SM SU(2)L \u00d7 U()Y\nquantum numbers. The spectrum of states in this theory\nis similar to that of the MSSM, but with the crucial\ndifference that the squarks are charged under SU(3)QCD0\ninstead of SM QCD. The typical scale for scalar quark\nmasses is a few hundred GeV. Since the two QCD\nsectors are related by the symmetry of equation (1) the\nscales \u039b, where QCD gets strong, and \u039b0 , where QCD'\ngets strong, are close, with the difference arising from\nradiative effects. This implies there is a gap between\nthe strong scale and the mass of the lightest matter field\nin the QCD0 sector. The absence of any light states\ncharged under both the SM gauge groups and QCD0\nimplies this theory may be considered an example of\na hidden valley model [7] in which the hidden valley\nparticles are glueballs and in which the energy scales\nand particle spectrum are motivated directly by the\nhierarchy problem. The purpose of this paper is to study\n\n\ffor the first time the collider phenomenology associated\nwith the production of heavy quark partners in this\nscenario. The charge assignments and strong dynamics\neffects will lead to signals that are very different from\neither supersymmetric or generic hidden valley models.\nTheories with a QCD0 sector where there is a large\nhierarchy between the masses of the matter fields and\nthe QCD0 scale, mq0 \u001d \u039b0 , give rise to very unusual\ndynamics [8][7][9][10]. For this reason the quarks (or\nscalar quarks) of such a sector have been dubbed quirks\n(or squirks) [9]. To understand this, let us first recall the\ndynamics of normal QCD. Consider two heavy quarks\nthat are produced back-to-back in a hard process. As\nthe two quarks get farther apart and their distance\napproaches \u039b\u22121 , confining dynamics sets in and some\nof their energy is lost to a gluonic flux tube extending\nbetween them. When the local energy density in the\nflux tube is high enough it is energetically favorable to\npair create a light quark anti-quark pair, ripping the\ntube. This mechanism of soft hadronization allows the\ntwo heavy quarks to hadronize separately.\nIn quirky QCD, on the other hand, such a soft\nhadronization mechanism is absent because there are no\nquarks with mass less than or comparable to \u039b0 . The\nenergy density in the QCD flux tube, or more simply, the\ntension of the QCD string cannot exceed \u039b02 which is far\nless than the mq0 per Compton wavelength needed to\ncreate a heavy quirk anti-quirk pair. The splitting of the\nQCD string by a quirk anti-quirk pair is exponentially\nsuppressed as exp(\u2212m2q0 /\u039b02 ) [8]. In fact, one may view\nthe entire process as single production of a highly excited\nbound state, squirkonium. All of the\n\u221a kinetic energy that\nthe quirks posses at production, \u015d \u2212 2mq0 , which is\ntypically of order mq0 , can be interpreted as squirkonium\nexcitation energy. This energy is radiated away into\nglueballs of QCD0 and photons. Eventually the two\nquirks pair-annihilate back into lighter states.\nFrom the above discussion it is clear that the characteristic collider signatures of folded supersymmetry\nare determined by the final states that the squirks\nannihilate into. In what follows we calculate the crosssection for production of these particles at the LHC, and\nevaluate the branching ratios for pair-annihilation into\nvarious final states. The possibility of discovering the\nsoft photons from the loss of excitation energy will be\ndiscussed elsewhere [11]. We then focus on the most\npromising annihilation channel for detection, which is W\n+ photon, and demonstrate the reach for this search at\nthe LHC. Some qualitative features of our analysis also\napply to the supersymmetric model of Babu, Gogoladze\nand Kolda [12], which also predicts quirky behaviour at\nthe weak scale.\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\n!

The up and down squirks have been taken\nto be degenerate.\n\nthe corresponding quarks, but are charged under QCD0 ,\nnot under QCD. Specifically, under SU(3)C0 \u00d7 SU(3)C \u00d7\nSU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y , where SU(3)C0 corresponds to QCD0 ,\nthe quantum numbers of the squirks are\nQ\u0303\n\n[3, 1, 2, (1/3)]\n\nc\n\n[3\u0304, 1, 1, (2/3)]\n\nD\u0303\n\u0168\n\nc\n\n[3\u0304, 1, 1, \u2212(4/3)]\n\n(2)\n\nTherefore, at a collider squirks are only weakly produced.\nThis could happen through the Drell-Yan process via an\noff-shell photon, Z, or W , or alternatively by gauge boson\nfusion. Production through the photon or the Z typically\ndoes not result in an observable signal, since the primary\nannihilation channel is to glueballs of QCD0 , which are\ninvisible \u2217 . In the simple analysis of this paper we focus\non production of squirks through s-channel W \u00b1\u2020 . In\nthis case the conservation of electric charge implies that\nsquirk annihilation must result in the emission of at least\none charged particle.\nFigure 1 shows the production cross-section for first\ngeneration SU(2) doublet up-down squirk anti-squirk\npairs through s-channel W + and W \u2212 as a function of\nthe squirk mass. In folded supersymmetry the second\ngeneration squirks are expected to be nearly degenerate\n\n\u2217\n\nII.\n\n200\n\nPRODUCTION AND ENERGY LOSS\n\u2020\n\nIn a folded supersymmetric model, the scalar quirks\nhave exactly the same electroweak quantum numbers as\n2\n\nAlthough glueballs of QCD0 decay back to SM states, giving rise\nto potentially observable signals [7], in the parameter range of\ninterest this generally happens outside the detector [6].\nIt should be pointed out that weak boson fusion may dominate\nover Drell-Yan production at high squirk mass [13] and may\nrequire further study.\n\n\fan SU(2) doublet are very small. The mass splitting is dominated by radiative effects and is of order\n(e2 /16\u03c0 2 )(MZ2 /mq0 ). The rate for beta decay is proportional to five powers of the mass splitting \u03b4mq0 , and is\ntherefore highly phase space suppressed.\n\nwith those of the first which will effectively double the\nsignal rate.\nThe squirks are in general produced with kinetic\nenergy much larger than \u039bQCD0 . We expect that a\nsignificant fraction of this energy is lost to photons\nand hidden glueballs prior to pair-annihilation. What\ndetermines the time-scale on which this happens? In\nparticular, should we expect displaced vertices in quirky\nevents?\nWe now argue that, in the context of folded supersymmetry, the pair-annihilation of squirks is prompt\non collider time-scales. Assuming the excitations of\nsquirkonium follow a Regge behavior En2 \u223c n\u039b02 , the\nenergy \u221a\nspacing between adjacent energy levels decreases\nlike 1/ n. In the limit of high quantum number n\nthe energy levels may be treated as a continuum and\nthe system may be treated semi-classically. The semi\nclassical description is that of two massive charged\nparticles connected by a string with tension \u039b02 . The\nstring exerts a constant force on the particles, leading to\nan acceleration of a = \u039b02 /mq0 .\nA system of accelerating charges must radiate soft\nphotons as dictated by Larmor's formula\nP =\n\n\u2202E\n8\u03c0\u03b1 2\n=\na .\n\u2202t\n3\n\n\u0393=\n\ntrad\n\n\u0012\n\n5 GeV\n\u039b0\n\n(3)\n\n\u00134\n\n10\u221218 sec\n\n(4)\nwhich is prompt. It is plausible that, because of the\nglueball mass gap, radiation of soft photons contributes a\nsubstantial part of the energy loss of excited squirkonium,\nleading to a novel signature of this scenario [11]. In any\ncase, other mechanisms of energy loss, such as emission of\nglueballs, can only make trad shorter. The rate for pairannihilation of squirkonium from a low lying state is of or2\n3\nder mq0 \u03b1QCD\n0 \u03b1W , which is also prompt on collider timescales. Here \u03b1QCD0 and \u03b1W are the structure constants\nfor QCD0 and the SM weak interactions respectively. We\nconclude that displaced vertices are not a characteristic\nfeature of folded supersymmetry.\nIII.\n\n(5)\n\nTherefore the scalar partners of the first two generations\nwill pair-annihilate before beta-decay can take place,\nresulting in an observable signal. For the third generation\nsquirks, on the other hand, the mass splittings are larger,\nof order m2t /(2mq 0 ) which is of order 30 GeV for squirks\nat 500 GeV. The lifetime of a stop squirk with this\nmass splitting is of order 10\u221219 seconds, which may be\ncomparable to the time scale for energy loss by radiation.\nThe dynamics of a squirk pair which undergoes beta\ndecay while oscillation may be quite interesting because\nof the large angular momentum introduced to the system,\nhowever we will not consider this possibility here. Even\nif the energy loss is much faster than beta decay, which\nmay be the case because glueball radiation, the stopsbottom quirkonium state is likely to annihilate via a\ncharged Higgs due to the large top yukawa coupling and\nis thus not likely to contribute to the signal we will\nconsider bellow. We therefore omit this case from further\nconsideration, and limit our discussion to the first two\ngenerations.\nWhat are the possible final states? One possibility\nis that the squirk and anti-squirk go back into two\nSM fermions through an s-channel W. In the limit that\nthe masses of the W and the final state fermions are\nneglected, the total cross-section for a squirk anti-squirk\npair into all possible SM fermion-antifermion pairs is\ngiven by\n\nThe time scale for energy loss from photon radiation,\nE/P \u223c mq0 /P , is thus\n\u0010 m 0 \u00113\n3 m3q0\nq\n\u223c\n=\n8\u03c0\u03b1 \u039b04\n500 GeV\n\nG2F (\u03b4mq0 )5\n15\u03c0 3\n\n\u03c3 = NQCD0 Nf vrel\n\n2\n\u03c0\u03b1W\n48E 2\n\n(6)\n\nHere E is the energy of each squirk, vrel is the relative\nvelocity between the squirks and Nf = 12 is the total\nnumber of possible SM final states. Other possible\nannihilation channels include W + photon and W + Z.\nConsider first the W + photon final state. In the limit\nthat vrel is very small, we obtain\n\u03c3vrel = NQCD0\n\nANNIHILATION\n\n\u03c0\u03b1W \u03b1\n18E 2\n\n(7)\n\nIn this expression we have neglected the mass of the W.\nFinally, for the W + Z final state, in the limit of very\nsmall relative velocity, we have\n\nSince squirkonium states produced through a W carry\nelectric charge, we expect that they will annihilate into\nSM particles, giving rise to promising collider signals.\nHowever, we must first verify that the charged state\ndoes not beta decay down to a neutral state prior to\nre-annihilation, which would result in the absence of an\nobservable signal.\nSince the first and second generation quarks have very\nsmall Yukawa couplings, the mass splittings between\nthe corresponding up-type and down-type squirks in\n\n\u03c3vrel = NQCD0 tan2 \u03b8W\n\n\u03c0\u03b1W \u03b1\n18E 2\n\n(8)\n\nHere \u03b8W is the weak mixing angle, and we have again\nneglected the masses of the W and the Z. We see from\nthese expressions that for slow-moving squirks which\nhave lost most of their energy or were produced close to\n3\n\n\fthe W+photon annihilation channel in the next section.\nBefore moving on to collider searches we should\nbriefly comment on the possibility of annihilating to\nW+glueball.\nThe direct annihilation to W+gluon\nnaively vanishes because any such amplitude is proportional to the trace of a single SU(3) generator.\nAnnihilating to W+glueball thus requires emitting at\nleast two gluons, and is therefore phase space suppressed.\nHowever, there may be another possibility for this annihilation to occur. It is believed that hybrid states exist in\nQCD [17]. These exotic states may be viewed as bound\nstates consisting of a meson in the color octet state and a\ngluon. Lattice studies show that QCD hybrid states carry\na variety of spin and parity quantum numbers, including\nsome states that mix directly with conventional mesons,\nand some that do not. In regular QCD the states that do\nnot mix with mesons can decay rapidly to, for example,\npions. However in quirky QCD0 , these states may be\nsemi-stable. In particular, lattice studies show that the\nmass splitting between some hybrid states and their\ncorresponding (same flavor) conventional meson state is\nsmaller than the estimated QCD glueball mass [17]. If\nthis is indeed the case, some quirky hybrid state will\nbe stable to glueball emission due to kinematics and\nwill thus annihilate directly. Since the q 0 q 0\u2217 state is in\nthe color octet, the amplitude for single gluon emission\nis no longer a trace of a single generator and will not\nvanish. These states are thus most likely to annihilate to\nW+glueball. The dynamical question is then, how often\ndoes the radiative energy loss of excited squirkonium\nlead to one of the exotic hybrid state rather than the\nconventional ground state? Keeping the W+glueball\nchannel in mind we leave this question for further work.\n\nFIG. 2: Branching ratios for a charged squirk-antisquirk pair\ninto various final states, as a function of the relative velovity\nof the pair.\n\nthreshold the most important channel is to W + photon,\nwith annihilation to two fermions becoming significant\nonly for larger values of the relative velocity.\nFigure 2 shows the branching ratios for pairannihilation of squirks into various final states, as a\nfunction of the relative velocity of the incoming squirks.\nThe relevant cross-sections have been evaluated using\nCalcHEP [14]. We see that for slow-moving squirks the\ndominant annihilation channel is to W + photon, in\nagreement with our analytic expressions above. This\nis promising for the LHC. The W + Z channel is also\nlarge enough to play a role. For more energetic squirks\nannihilation through an off-shell W into two SM fermions\ndominates. In this case the charged lepton + missing\nenergy and top + bottom final states are most likely to\nprove useful.\nIn order to devise a search strategy it is therefore\nimportant to understand whether annihilation typically\noccurs at high or low relative velocities. As descirbed in\nmore detail in [9, 11], annihilation will occur dominantly\nat low values of angular momentum. The angular momentum in the squirkonium system will grow in a random\nwalk as the excited state radiates quanta. Following the\nformalism developed in [9] we estimate that the probability for squirk annihilation in a single period at low\nangular momentum and high velocity is approximately\n10\u22124 \u2021 . This small probability implies that the squirk\nsystem will typically gain significant angular momentum\nbefore annihilation occurs, and the squirkonium pair will\nreach near its ground state before annihilating. With this\nmotivation in mind we will consider a search for squirks in\n\n\u2021\n\nIV.\n\nLHC SEARCH\n\nIn this final section we will demonstrate the feasibility\nof searching for the annihilation products of squirk bound\nstates at the LHC and estimate the signal to background\nratios after employing various kinematic cuts. We will\nfocus on the W+photon annihilation signal. As discussed\nabove, this final state dominates when the squirkonium\nbound state has lost most of its energy by radiation\nand the annihilation takes place at or near the ground\nstate. The expected signal is a peak in the invariant\nmass of W+photon. The concentration of the signal at\na mass peak will be crucial for the signal to stand above\nbackground.\nWe focus on events in which the W boson decays\nleptonically. Despite the inability to measure the neutrino energy and longitudinal momentum the invariant\nmass of the squirkonium may be reconstructed if one\nassumes the lepton and missing ET come from an on shell\nW, and that the neutrino is the only source of missing\ntransverse energy. If this is the case, the width of the\nmass peak arises predominantly form detector effects and\nfrom squirkonium decays from low lying excited states,\n\nThis is significantly less than the annihilation probability for\nfermionic quirks.\n\n4\n\n\fFIG. 3: An estimate of the signal versus the background as a\nfunction of the squirk mass in GeV. The bottom curve is the\nsquirk pair production cross section in the charged channel.\nThe annihilation of these squirk pair will dominantly produce\nW \u00b1 +photon with and invariant mass of \u223c 2mq0 . The\np top\ncurve is the SM W \u00b1 +photon with |mW \u03b3 \u2212 2mq0 | < \u039bmq0\nfor \u039b = 15 GeV.\n\nFIG. 4: The photon \u03b7 distribution for SM W+photon events\nwith center of mass energy of 1 TeV or more (red bars).\nThe estimated signal distribution is shown as a solid curve.\nEmploying a cut of \u03b7 < 1.5 increases the signal to background\nration by more than a factor of two.\n\nrather than true ground states (of order \u039b0 \u223c 10 GeV).\nThis mass peak is likely to be smeared due to additional transverse missing energy from the radiative\ndecay. The energy loss due to radiation is expected to be\ndistributed in a particular pattern which is symmetric\nunder ~x \u2192 \u2212~x, that is, for every glueball or photon\nemitted in one direction, a similar photon will be emitted\nin the opposite direction. In the classical limit (an infinite\nnumber of soft quanta) such energy loss does not introduce new transverse momentum. However, for glueball\nradiation the classical limit is not appropriate because\nthe glueball mass cannot be neglected when compared\nto the total amount of energy radiated. The additional\nmissing transverse energy is inversely proportional to the\nsquare root of the number of glueball quanta emittted,\nin the limit that the total energy radiated is held fixed.\nWe will (conservatively) assume that most of the energy\nis\nplost by glueball emission giving a missing ET of order\nmq0 \u039b0 , which is of order 100 GeV or less in most of our\nparameter space.\nIn the case where the W decays leptonically, the\nleading background is continuum SM production of\nW+photon. For simplicity we will estimate the signalto-background ratio by comparing the W+photon signal cross section to the invariant mass distributions of\nbackground\np W+photon in the mass window a |mW \u03b3 \u2212\n2mq0 | < \u039bmq0 GeV. For the purpose of this estimate\nhave conservatively chosen a rather high value of \u039b =\n15GeV , about a factor of 10 above our QCD gluball\nmass calculated on the lattice. Background events were\ngenerated using MadEvent [16]. As shown in Figure 3,\nthe signal to background ratio is of order a half for all of\nthe mass range within LHC reach. Taking the leptonic\nbranching fraction of the W boson (to electrons or muons\n\nonly) and a low branching fraction of squirkonium to\nW+photon of 0.6, a 5 sigma discovery of squirks with\na mass of 400 GeV is possible with \u223c11 fb\u22121 of data.\nWith 100 fb\u22121 the discovery reach is approximately 620\nGeV.\nOne can improve the discovery reach by employing\na pseudorapidity cut on the final state photon. The\nsignal events involve the production and decay of heavy\nsquirkonium. Even after losing its excitation energy, the\nsquirkonium will be nearly at rest in the lab frame and\nis expected to decay isotropically. In Figure 4 we show\nthe distribution of the photon's pseudorapidity, \u03b7, for\nSM W+photon events with invariant mass of 1 TeV or\nmore. The shape of the distribution is similar for different\ninvariant masses. This distribution is compared with\nthe expected signal distribution (shown as solid curve).\nThis was estimated by convoluting the \u03b7 distribution\nof isotropic decay with the longitudinal boost of the\nsquirkonuim system (which is simply the longitudinal\nboost of the CoM frame in squirk production, generated\nby MadEvent).\nPlacing a cut on \u03b7 of the photon of 1.5 reduces the\nbackground by a factor of \u223c 2.2 while the signal is\nonly reduced by \u223c 15%. Including the \u03b7 cut, 5 sigma\ndiscovery of 400 GeV squirks may be reached with\napproximately 8.5 fb\u22121 . Taking this estimate at face\nvalue, with 100 fb\u22121 the LHC will be able to discover\none generation of squirks up to a mass of 500 GeV and\ntwo degenerate generations of squirks (as is the case in\nin folded SUSY) up to a mass of 650 GeV. However,\none could imagine improving this analysis, for example,\nby optimization of the \u03b7 cut. Alternatively, we could\nperform additional cuts on lepton rapidity or compare\ntransverse mass distributions instead of reconstructed\n5\n\n\ftion (FAPESP), as well as the Brazilian National Counsel\nfor Technological and Scientific Development (CNPq).\nThe work of ZC and CAK was partially supported\nby the NSF under award number PHY-0408954.
