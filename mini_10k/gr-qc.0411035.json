Ghosh\u2217 and P. Mitra\u2020\nSaha Institute of Nuclear Physics\n1/AF Bidhannagar\nCalcutta 700064, India\n\nAbstract\nA proper counting of states for black holes in the quantum geometry\napproach shows that the dominant configuration for spins are distributions\nthat include spins exceeding one-half at the punctures. This raises the\nvalue of the Immirzi parameter and the black hole entropy. However, the\ncoefficient of the logarithmic correction remains -1/2 as before.\n\nThe quantum geometry approach to a quantum theory of gravity is reasonably well established now: see [1] for reviews. In [2] a general framework for the\ncalculation of black hole entropy in this approach was proposed. A lower bound\nfor the entropy was worked out on the basis of the association of spin one-half to\neach puncture and found to be proportional to the area of the horizon. The proportionality constant involves what is known as the Immirzi parameter, which\ncan be chosen so that the entropy becomes a quarter of the area.\nRecently, this lower bound was sharpened in [3] to include a logarithmic\ncorrection \u2212 21 ln A. Subsequently, it was found [4] that the dominant term\nin the entropy is somewhat higher by taking spins higher than one-half into\naccount, though the logarithmic correction is unaffected in this calculation. In\nthe present note we investigate the modification of the lower bound of [3] in\nview of this development and are led to a further increase in the leading term.\nLet a generic configuration have sj punctures with spin j, j = 1/2, 1, 3/2, 2, ....\nNote that\nX p\nsj j(j + 1) = A ,\n2\n(1)\nj\n\nwhere A is the horizon area in units where 4\u03c0\u03b3l2P = 1, \u03b3 being the Immirzi parameter and lP the Planck length. Following [2], we shall treat the punctures as\ndistinguishable, see also [6]. We shall count states of the physical Hilbert space\n\u2217 amitg@theory.saha.ernet.in\n\u2020 mitra@theory.saha.ernet.in\n\n1\n\n\fconsidering both j and its projection m as quantum numbers. The difference\nbetween this procedure and the calculation carried out in [4] will be commented\non later.\nP\nIf we ignore the zero spin projection constraint ( m = 0, the sum extending\nover all punctures) initially, the total number of states is given by\nP\n( j sj )! Y\n(2)\nN= Q\n(2j + 1)sj ,\ns\n!\nj\nj\nj\nwhere one has to sum over all nonnegative sj consistent with the given value of\nA. We will estimate the sum by maximizing the above expression with respect\nto the variables sj subject to a fixed value of A.\nUsing Stirling's formula, we see that\ni\nX\nX\nX h\nsj ) .\n(3)\nsj ) ln(\nsj ln(2j + 1) \u2212 ln sj + (\nln N =\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nHence,\n\u03b4 ln N =\n\nX\nj\n\nh\nX i\nsk ,\n\u03b4sj ln(2j + 1) \u2212 ln sj + ln\n\n(4)\n\nk\n\nso that with some Lagrange multiplier \u03bb to implement the area constraint, we\ncan set\nX\np\nln(2j + 1) \u2212 ln sj + ln\nsk \u2212 \u03bb j(j + 1) = 0 .\n(5)\nk\n\nThus,\niX\nh\np\nsj = (2j + 1) exp \u2212 \u03bb j(j + 1)\nsk .\n\n(6)\n\nk\n\nSumming over j, we obtain the relation\nh\ni\nX\np\n(2j + 1) exp \u2212 \u03bb j(j + 1) = 1 ,\n\n(7)\n\nj\n\nwhich determines \u03bb \u2243 1.72. It may be mentioned that (7) was noted as a mathematical possibility in [4], and was derived with a somewhat different motivation\nin [5].\nSubstituting the expression for sj one easily gets the entropy to be\nS = ln N = \u03bbA/2.\n\n(8)\n\nThis means that the Immirzi parameter has to be set at \u03bb/(2\u03c0) \u2243 0.274. Note\nthat the summation over sj may raise this value while the imposition of the zero\nprojection constraint is expected to lower it slightly.\n2\n\n\fThe higher spins clearly raise the leading term, as in [4], but our expression\nis even larger than that of [4]. The difference arises from the fact that we have\nallowed all values m = \u2212j, ..., j for all j, whereas [4] did not distinguish states\nwith the same values of m but different j. It is interesting to notice that their\nequation\nX\np\n2 exp[\u2212\u03b3\u0303 j(j + 1)] = 1,\n(9)\nj\n\nwhich they got instead of (7), would have been obtained by us if we had\nrestricted m = \u00b1j for each j. This shows that although they wanted to\ncount\nP p states characterized by only the quantum numbers m and satisfying\n2\n|m|(|m| + 1) \u2264 A, allowing for |m| \u2264 j, their result is the same as though\nthey were interested only in states with |m| = j and area equal to A. States\nwith lower values of |m| appear to be negligibly fewer in comparison.\nNote further that if one allows m to have all its 2j + 1 values for each j,\ntheir first recursion relation (with the zero projection constraint ignored) would\nget altered to\n\u0010\n\u0011 p\nX\np\n(2j + 1)N A \u2212 2 j(j + 1) + A2 + 1 ,\nN (A) =\n(10)\nj\n\nwhich is satisfied by our estimate N (A) = exp(\u03bbA/2) with \u03bb satisfying (7) above.\nOur expression for the entropy thus agrees with the solution obtained from the\nmodified recursion relation when the zero projection constraint is ignored.\nWe shall now impose the constraint of zero angular momentum projection.\nThe number of configurations will be reduced somewhat, and a correction is\nexpected\nP to emerge. Let sj,m punctures carry spin j and projection m, i.e.\nsj = m sj,m . Since at each puncture (j, m) assigns a unique state the total\nnumber of states N equals the number of ways sj and sj,m can be distributed\namong themselves,\nP\nP\n( j,m sj,m )!\n( j sj )! Y\nsj !\nQ\nQ\n= Q\n,\n(11)\nN=\ns\n!\nj,m\nj sj !\nm\nj,m sj,m !\nj\nP\nsubject to the constraints j,m msj,m = 0 and (1). A lower bound is obtained\nby replacing sj,m for each m by sj /(2j Q\n+ 1) for the corresponding j. This maximizes the number of combinations sj !/ m sj,m ! for each j and also ensures zero\ntotal spin projection for each j, hence for the sum. In Stirling's approximation,\nthe main departure from (2j + 1)sj occurs as the denominator contains a factor\n[sj /(2j + 1)]j+1/2 , leading to a correction\n\u2212(j + 1/2) ln[sj /(2j + 1)] (cf. [3]) in\np\nln N . As sj /(2j + 1) \u221d A exp[\u2212\u03bb j(j + 1)], this correction can be expressed as\ni\nXh\np\n(12)\nln A \u2212 \u03bb j(j + 1) (j + 1/2),\n\u2212\nj\n\nwhich appears to be divergent. This happens because all sj have been assumed\nto be large, although for large j, sj in the expression given above goes to zero.\n3\n\n\fSo we restrict the sum to j for which sj is greater than unity. Taking the largest\nj to be n/2, we see that\nh\ni\np\nexp \u2212 \u03bb n(n + 2)/4 A \u2243 1,\n(13)\nso that\nn \u2243 2 ln A/\u03bb.\n\n(14)\n\nNow\nX\nj\n\nj = n(n + 1)/4 \u2243 (ln A)2 /\u03bb2 .\n\n(15)\n\np\nTherefore the ln A piece yields a (ln A)3 correction. The piece \u2212\u03bb j(j + 1) also\nhas to be taken into account, using the sum\nX\nj 2 \u2243 n3 /12 \u2243 2(ln A)3 /(3\u03bb3 ).\n(16)\nj\n\nThe total correction comes to \u2212(ln A)3 /(3\u03bb2 ): the total entropy is bounded by\nthe contribution of these configurations:\nS \u2265 \u03bbA/2 \u2212 (ln A)3 /(3\u03bb2 ).\n\n(17)\n\nThis is our new lower bound.\nIt must be noted that this bound has been derived by assuming a specific\ndistribution of spins and spin projections to give the largest number of combinations. Summing over different sj is expected to increase the number of\nconfigurations. Note that there also are additional nonleading terms in the expressions used above which have been neglected, but these are much smaller in\nmagnitude than (ln A)3 and yield (ln A)2 and ln A pieces.\nLet us now estimate the entropy, which as mentioned above is expected to be\nhigher than the above bound because of summation over different configurations.\nIn view of the zero spin projection constraint, the number of configurations may\nbe written by explicitly summing over sj,m for each j as (see [3])\nP\nZ\nisj\n( j sj )! 2\u03c0 d\u03c9 Y h X\nexp(imj \u03c9) .\n(18)\nNcorr = Q\n\u22122\u03c0 4\u03c0 j\nj sj !\nm\nj\n\nThis can be rewritten as\nNcorr =\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\u22122\u03c0\n\nd\u03c9\nN (\u03c9) ,\n4\u03c0\n\n(19)\n\nwhere\nP\nisj\n( j sj )! Y h X\nexp(imj \u03c9) .\nN (\u03c9) = Q\nj sj !\nm\nj\nj\n\n4\n\n(20)\n\n\fTo maximize Ncorr , we regard sj as functions sj (\u03c9) subject to the area constraint\nand maximize N (\u03c9). The result is a simple modification of the one obtained\nabove,\nN (\u03c9) = exp(\u03bb(\u03c9)A/2) ,\n\n(21)\n\nwhere \u03bb(\u03c9) satisfies\n1=\n\nX\nj\n\nj\ni X\np\n\u0001\nexp \u2212 \u03bb(\u03c9) j(j + 1)\nexp i\u03c9m .\n\nh\n\n(22)\n\nm=\u2212j\n\nThis equation differs from that of [4] in m going over \u2212j, ..., j, whereas their m\ngoes over \u00b1j as before. The modified recursion relation for N (A, p), which is\nthe\nP number of configurations satisfying the area constraint (1) and the relation\nm = p, is\nN (A, p) =\n\nj\nX X\nj\n\nm=\u2212j\n\nN (A \u2212 2\n\np\np\n\u0001\nj(j + 1), p \u2212 m) + \u03b8 A \u2212 2 |p|(|p| + 1) , (23)\n\nand gives rise to the above equation for \u03bb(\u03c9).\nFor \u03c9 = 0, (22) resembles (7), so \u03bb(0) = \u03bb. This yields the dominant\ncontribution exp(\u03bbA/2) seen above. For small \u03c9, \u03bb(\u03c9) falls quadratically, and\nthe \u03c9 integral becomes a gaussian, which is readily seen to be proportional to\nA\u22121/2 by appropriate scaling. Thus,\nScorr = ln Ncorr \u223c ln\n\n\u0002 exp(\u03bbA/2) \u0003\nA1/2\n\n= \u03bbA/2 \u2212\n\n1\nln A.\n2\n\n(24)\n\nThis is exactly as in [3, 4], indicating that the (ln A)3 , (ln A)2 terms do not\nsurvive when summed over configurations.\nOne can see this directly by approximating the sums over configurations (i.e.\nsums over sj,m ) by integrals: variation of N in (11) with sj,m leads to a factor\nexp[\u2212(\u03b4sj,m )2 /2sj,m ]. Denominator factors of (2\u03c0sj,m )1/2 coming from Stirling's approximation are cancelled by similar factors in the numerator coming\nfrom this gaussian integration:\nZ \u221e\nh (\u03b4s )2 i\n\u00011/2\nj,m\n.\n(25)\n= 2\u03c0sj,m\nd(\u03b4sj,m ) exp \u2212\n2sj,m\n\u2212\u221e\nEach sj,m is proportional to A. The area constraint and the spin projection\nconstraint, which may be thought\n\u221a of as reducing the number of summations,\nreduce the number\nof\nfactors\nof\nA by two. But\n\u221a the numerator too has such a\nP\nfactor through ( s)1/2 . An overall factor 1/ A is thus left, as above, leading\nto the logarithmic correction with a coefficient -1/2.\nIn conclusion, we have estimated the entropy of a black hole in the quantum\ngeometry approach by allowing spins of all non-zero values at different punctures\nand regarding both j and m as relevant quantum numbers. It was noted in [2]\n5\n\n\fthat the entropy in the leading order is the same whether one considers j as\nrelevant or not, with spin one-half assumed to yield the counting. However, the\ndominant configuration, with the largest contribution to the number of states,\ncontains spins higher than one-half, so that the assumption made in [2] has to\nbe relaxed. The counting done in [4] treated j as irrelevant and our result is\ndifferent from theirs in the leading order, although, somewhat surprisingly, the\ncoefficient of the logarithmic term remains the same. The reason why j has\nat times been disregarded in the state counting is that this quantum number\nappears only in the volume Hilbert space and not in the surface Hilbert space\n[2], while it is the surface Hilbert space which is considered to be the space\nof quantum states of the isolated horizon. However, although the area of a\nclassical isolated horizon is defined intrinsically on the surface, the area operator\nof a quantum isolated horizon is defined only to act on the volume Hilbert\nspace. In fact, the area of the horizon is determined by the 'volume' quantum\nnumbers j. So, in our view, j cannot be regarded as a hidden quantum number\nin characterizing the states of a quantum isolated horizon. In the end, then,\nthe reason for the difference in our results from [4] is due to this difference in\nthe definition of black hole states. Which definition is more appropriate may\nbe fixed either by making an independent estimate of the Immirzi parameter\nor by performing some other semiclassical calculations from quantum isolated\nhorizons.\n\nReferences\n[1] A.
