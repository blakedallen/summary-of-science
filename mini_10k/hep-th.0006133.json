K.R. Brownstein [1] points out that these waves may emerge as\n~ \u00d7 V~ = k V~ (V~ is a vector field and k is a positive\nsolutions of the vector equation \u2207\n\n~ as\nconstant). Brownstein considers this equation for the vector potential A\n~ \u00d7A\n~ = kA\n~,\n\u2207\n\n(1.1)\n\nh\ni\n~ = a i sin kz + \u0135 cos kz cos \u03c9t\nA\n\n(1.2)\n\nwith a particular solution\n\nand takes the associated electric and magnetic field as\nh\ni\n~\n~ = \u2212 1 \u2202 A = ka i sin kz + \u0135 cos ka sin \u03c9t\nE\nc \u2202t\n\n(1.3)\n\nand\nh\ni\n~ =\u2207\n~ \u00d7A\n~ = ka \u00eesinkz + j cos kz cos \u03c9t .\nB\n\n(1.4)\n\nThe Brownstein fields (1.3) and (1.4) satisfy Maxwell equations and the usual vacuum\n~ and B\n~ and the vector potential, A,\n~ are parallel\nfree-wave equation. Moreover, fields, E\neverywhere. The associated electromagnetic wave has a null Poynting vector and, so, does\nnot propagate energy. The behavior of this wave is just like the phenomenology suggested\nby Plasma and Astrophysical Plasma Physics.\nBut it is pointed out [9] that this model is not complete, at least for Astrophysical\nPlasma. There it is argued that in an Astrophysical Plasma, gravitation must be taken\ninto account in a way that the gravitational background can break the parellelism between\n\n\f3\n~ and B.\n~ Consequently, the corresponding eletromagnetic wave does not have\nthe fields E\na null Poynting vector. It is not a stationary wave and propagates energy.\nIn this work, we consider the electromagnetic and gravitional coupling and we analyze,\nin a gravitational background, the corresponding Maxwell equations. We get the asso~ and B\n~ and discuss the corresponding electrostatic\nciated free-wave equation for fields E\n~ does not\nregime. That is, the situation in a gravitational background in which the field E\n~ and vice-versa.\ninduce the field B\n~ may depend on time\nAnd we show that, in a particular situation, electric field E\n~ with or without sources. Finally we show particbut does not induce magnetic field B\nular electrostatic and magnetostatic solutions for Maxwell equations without sources in\n~ 0 and the\na gravitational background. These solutions are such that the electric field, E\n~ 0 , both satisfy the corresponding free-wave equations. Moroever these\nmagnetic field, B\n~0\nfields behave as the phenomenology in Plasma Astrophysics has suggested, that is, E\n~ 0 are parallel fields. Thus, the associated electromagnetic wave is stationary, has a\nand B\nnull vector Poynting and does not propagate energy.\n\n2\n\nElectromagnetic and Gravitational Coupling\nThe action for the gravitaional and electromagnetic coupling is written as\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n\u221a\n1\n\u03bc\u03bd\nS=\n\u2212g \u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd F\nd4 s ,\n4\n\n(2.1)\n\nrequiring stationary action (\u03b4S = 0) the corresponding Maxwell inhomogeneous equations\nin a gravitational background are\nD\u03bc F \u03bc\u03bd = J \u03bc ,\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere the covariant derivative above is given as:\n\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bb\nD\u03bc F \u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc F \u03bc\u03bd + \u0393\u03bc\u03bd\n= J\u03bd .\n\u03bc\u03bb + \u0393\u03bc\u03bb \u0393\n\n(2.3)\n\n\f4\nThe corresponding homogeneous Maxwell equations are\nD\u03bc F\u03bd\u03c1 + D\u03bd F\u03c1\u03bc + D\u03c1 F\u03bc\u03bd = 0 .\n\n(2.4)\n\nThe connection terms of this equation cancel each other in such a way that this equation\nis the usual homogeneous Maxwell equation\n\u2202\u03bc F\u03bd\u03c1 + \u2202\u03bd F\u03c1\u03bc + \u2202\u03c1 F\u03bc\u03bd = 0 .\n\n(2.5)\n\nFinally, to analyse these equations we adopt the F.R.W. cosmological metric\ndS 2 = dt2 \u2212 (a(t))2\n\nn\n\n1 \u2212 Ar 2\n\n\u0001\u22121\n\ndr 2 + r 2 d\u03b82 + r 2 sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62\n\no\n\n,\n\n(2.6)\n\nwhere the term a(t) is the scale factor and the constant A may assume values A = 1, 0, \u22121.\nEach value represents the associated curvature of F.R.W. spatial metric.\nThe second term \u0393\u03bc\u03bc\u03bb of the covariant derivative equation (2.3) can be written as\n\u0393\u03bc\u03bc\u03bb = \u2212\n\n\u2202h\n\u2202x\u03bb\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere\nh = ln\n\np\n\u2212g\u0303\n\n(2.8)\n\nand g\u0303 is the metric determinant. In terms of the electric field, E i = F 0i , and the magnetic\nfield B i = \u03b5ijk Fjk , the Maxwell eq.

So under these conditions the magnetic field, B(~r, t), does not induce the\nelectric field, E(~r, t), and vice-versa. This way we call these equations magnetostatic and\nelectrostatic, but we must remember the electric field is not static but depends on time\naccording to eq.

It is interesting to point out that the electric and magnetic fields are\nparallel and satisfy the free-wave eq. (2.19) and eq. (2.20). The electromagnetic wave has\n\n\f9\nparallel electric and magnetic fields, has a null Poynting vector, it is a stationary wave and\nit does not propagate energy as suggested by the Astrophysical Plasma phenomenology.\n~ and the unitary azimutal vector \u03c6\u0302 are perpendicular vectors, so (\u03c6\u0302, \u2207h,\n~ \u03c6\u0302\u00d7\nThe term \u2207h\n\n~\n\u2207h)\nform a complete set and any vector can be written as:\n\n~ + V\u03c6h (\u03c6\u0302 \u00d7 \u2207h)\n~\nV~ = V\u03c6 \u03c6\u0302 + Vh \u2207h\n\n(4.7)\n\nThe vector components V\u03c6 , Vh and V\u03c6h may depend on time and spatial coordinates.\n~ r, t) for Maxwell equations in a gravitational background\nGeneral solutions E(~r, t) and B(~\nusing the ansatz (4.7) are being considered.\nWe conclude that in astrophysical plasma it is important to consider electromagnetic\nand gravitational coupling and this coupling modifies the free-wave equations for electric\nand magnetic fields.\n\nAcknowledgements:\nThe authors acknowledge J.A.
