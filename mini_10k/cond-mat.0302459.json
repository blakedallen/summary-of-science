Introduction\nRecent experimental breakthrough 1) of manufacturing Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC)\nin magnetically trapped dilute gases of alkali-metal atoms has created new opportunities to\ntest many-body theories in well-controlled experimental conditions. Although the phenomena can be considered as a spectacular realization of an old prediction of quantum statistical\nmechanics as applied to ideal bose gases 2) , it is known that mutual interactions of particles\nstill play important roles to determine characteristic properties of the systems. 3), 4)\nIn theoretical treatments the condensate is usually described by the dilute gas approximation in which the pair-wise short range interaction is fully accommodated by the use of\nthe effective interaction, usually referred to as the pseudo-potential, defined by\nVeff. (r) =\n\n4\u03c0h\u03042 a\n\u03b4(r) = g\u03b4(r) ,\nm\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere a is the S-wave scattering length of the pair interaction and m is the mass of the\nparticle, while the many-body collective dynamics of the condensate is described by the\nGross-Pitaevskii equation 5) , also known as the non-linear Schr\u00f6dinger equation, for a classical field \u03a6(r, t);\n#\n\"\nh\u03042 \u22072\n\u2202\u03a6(r, t)\n2\n(1.2)\n= \u2212\n+ g|\u03a6(r, t)| \u03a6(r, t) .\nih\u0304\n\u2202t\n2m\nThis equation can be derived from the Heisenberg equation of motion of the quantum field\n\u03c8(r, t)\nih\u0304\n\n\u2202\u03c8(r, t)\nh\u03042 \u22072 \u03c8(r, t)\n= [\u03c8(r, t), \u0124] = \u2212\n+ g\u03c8 \u2020 (r, t)\u03c8 2 (r, t)\n\u2202t\n2m\n\n(1.3)\n\nby the replacement\n\u03c8(r, t) \u2192 \u03a6(r, t) = h\u03c8(r, t)icoh.\nwhere the expectation value is taken with a coherent state of the particle creation and\nannihilation operator of the lowest single particle state. This approximation is also known\nas the tree approximation in the language of the loop expansion 6) and ignores quantum\nfluctuations around the mean field \u03a6(r, t). It is the purpose of the present work to investigate\nthe effect of quantum corrections to the mean field by the variational method which we have\ndeveloped for describing dynamics of quantum fields. 7), 8)\nWhen the effective interaction of the form (1.1) is used to calculate the effect of the\nquantum fluctuations, a special care is needed to avoid (ultraviolet) divergences which arises\ndue to the singular nature of the potential which causes coupling of all momentum modes.\n9) - 11)\nIt has been shown by Lee, Huang and Yang 9) that such divergences can be eliminated\n2\n\n\fsystematically by the proper use of the pseudo-potential defined by 12)\nVps. (r) = g\u03b4(r)\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\nr = g\u03b4(r) + g\u03b4(r)r\n.\n\u2202r\n\u2202r\n\n(1.4)\n\n\u2202\n,\n\u2202r\n\n(1.5)\n\nThe difference,\n\u2206V (r) = Vps. (r) \u2212 Veff. (r) = g\u03b4(r)r\n\nwhich has only vanishing contribution in the first order, generates divergent terms in higher\norder and it is precisely these divergent terms which cancel the divergences which are contained in the higher order quantum corrections of Veff. (r). 9)\nPhysically this procedure is understood as the elimination of the double counting in the\nusual perturbation expansion in terms of the bare two particle interaction V0 (r): since the\npair scattering (in vacuum) is already fully accounted for by the scattering length a, one\nshould not include, when performing many body calculation, contributions from repeated\nuse of the effective interaction (1.1) in the two particle scattering channel.\u2217) For example,\nthe contributions from the diagram in Fig. 1 (a) should not be included in the many body\ncalculation, because it is a part of the diagrams Fig. 1 (b) which is already included in the\nlowest order diagrams Fig. 1 (c) in terms of Veff. . The problem of ultraviolet divergence can of\ncourse be avoided if one starts from a bare two-body interaction of finite range; this approach\nwould however involve much more elaborate calculations even for a static system. 15)\nElimination of the ultraviolet divergences due to the singular potential looks technically\nsimilar to the renormalization of the effective local couplings in quantum field theories to\neliminate ultraviolet divergences. 14) This analogy was exploited further by Toyoda 16) and\nmore recently by Braaten and Nieto. 11) However, here we choose to remove all divergences by\nsimply avoiding double countings of pair scatterings, by inspection, based on the observation\nthat the effective interaction (1.1) should be used only in the first Born \"approximation\" to\ndescribe two particle scattering.\nThis does not mean, however, that we should discard the quantum fluctuations entirely:\nthe many-body interaction such as Fig. 2 should be still retained in the calculation. For\nexample, the well-known Bogoliubov theory 17) contains the effect of quantum fluctuations\nas zero-point oscillations of quasi-particle modes; the contribution to the energy density of\nthis fluctuation would diverge if one uses the potential of the form (1.1). This divergence\ncan be eliminated by the above procedure leaving behind non-analytic a5/2 correction which\noriginates from the sum of genuine many-body interaction contributions. 9)\nAlthough the procedure to eliminate the ultraviolet divergence found in the literature 13), 14) is very\nsuggestive, this interpretation of the subtraction of the double counting terms was never explicitly mentioned\nelsewhere to the best of our knowledge.\n\u2217)\n\n3\n\n\fp3\n\np1\np2\n\ng\n\np1\ng\n\np4\n\np2\n\np1\n\np1\n\nV0\n\ng\np2\n\np2\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFig. 1. The one-loop diagram depicted in (a) should not be included in the calculation since it is\na part of (b) which is already included in the first order (tree) diagram (c).\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\nFig. 2. Some diagrams which cannot be reduced to the pair interaction like Fig. 1 (b) and therefore\nshould be included in the calculation.\n\nIn this paper we present the basic formulation of the variational method and derive\nthe equations of motion which generalizes the Gross-Pitaevskii mean field equation (1.2)\nto include the effect of quantum fluctuations in terms of the reduced density matrix. The\nresultant equations are similar to those known as the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov equations for\nfermions in nuclear many-boby theory 21) and are identical, although slightly disguised, to\nthe ones obtained for interacting bose-systems by Blaizot and Ripka 22) , and more recently\nby Griffin 23) . The general static solutions of these equations are given in terms of the mode\nfunctions. We then perform an explicit calculation for a uniform condensate and show how\nthe divergent terms appear by the use of the effective potential (1.1). By the inspection\nof the origin of these divergences in perturbation series we will demonstrate that all these\ndivergences can be eliminated by the systematic removal of the terms which correspond to\nthe double counting of pair scattering. By this method we obtain a gap equation free of\ndivergence, (6.20), a new result obtained in this paper: To the best of our knowledge, this\nequation has never been written explicitly in the literature. In the forthcoming paper, we\nshall apply the present method to compute the density response function of the system.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we construct the\nGaussian variational wave functional for condensates in a general trapping external potential.\nIn section 3, we derive the equations of motion which consist of a generalized Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation for the condensate and the Liouville equation for the reduced density matrix. Our\n4\n\n\fgeneralized Gross-Pitaevskii equations consist of two coupled non-linear equations: one is\nthe equation of motion for \u03a6(r, t) similar to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (1.2), but it\nalso contains the mean field terms associated with the fluctuations, and the other is the\nequation of motion for the fluctuations, written in the form of the Liouville equation for\nthe reduced density matrix consisting of fluctuations, these equations are often called the\ntime-dependent Hartree-Bogoliubov equation. In section 4, we show that these equations\ncan be easily extended to finite temperatures using the Gaussian density matrix which is\ndetermined self-consistently. In section 5, we express the static solutions of these equations\nin terms of the mode functions. In section 6 we examine the static solution in uniform\nsystem in detail and compare the results to the well-known Bogoliubov's mean field theory.\nWe illustrate how the divergence can be eliminated by the removal of the double counting\nterms in the diagrams of perturbative series. A brief summary is given in section 7.\n\n\u00a72. Gaussian wave functional\nIn this and following sections we shall apply the variational method developed earlier 18), 7)\nin the functional Schr\u00f6dinger picture to derive an extended form of the Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation which contain the effect of quantum fluctuations in a minimal fashion.\nWe consider a non-relativistic gas of bose particles of mass m interacting via contact\ninteraction in the form of (1.1). The dynamics of system is described by the following\nsecond quantized Hamiltonian:\n\n\u0124 =\n\nZ\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\nd3 x \u2212\n\uf8f3\n\n1 \u2020\n\u03c8 (x)\u22072 \u03c8(x) + \u03c8 \u2020 (x)Vext (x)\u03c8(x)\n2m\n\uf8fc\n\uf8fd\n\ng\n+ \u03c8 \u2020 (x)\u03c8 \u2020 (x)\u03c8(x)\u03c8(x) .\n\uf8fe\n2\n\n(2.1)\n\nHere, Vext represents an external confining potential provided by the magnetic trap and the\nmutual interaction of particle is given by the effective interaction of the form (1.1) . The\nfields \u03c8(x) are quantized by the commutation relation : [ \u03c8(x) , \u03c8 \u2020 (y) ] = \u03b4 3 (x \u2212 y) and\nthe other combinations are equal to 0.

This feature, characteristic of\nthe Gaussian Ansatz of the fluctuations, enables one to truncate otherwise infinite set of\ncoupled equations of the motion for the expectation values of the products of the quantum\nfields into a set of coupled equations of motion for the mean field \u03a6(x, t) and the two-point\nfunctions of fluctuations G(x, y; t).\n8\n\n\f\u00a73. Equations of motion\nThe equations of motion can be derived from the time-dependent variational principle as\napplied to the action:\n\n\u2202\n\u2212 \u0124 + \u03bcN\u0302 |\u03a8 i ,\n(3.1)\n\u2202t\nwhere \u03bc is the chemical potential of the bosons introduced to enforce that the total number\nS=\n\nZ\n\ndth\u03a8 |i\n\nof the bosons N = h\u03a8 |N\u0302|\u03a8 i, defined with N\u0302 = dx\u03c8 \u2020 (x)\u03c8(x), is conserved. Minimization\nof (3.1) with respect to the variational parameters leads to the equations of motion of \u03c6\u0304(x, t)\nand \u03c0\u0304(x, t), G\u22121 (x, y; t) and \u03a3(x, y; t) 7) which can be rewritten for the mean field and the\nR\n\nfluctuations.\nAlternatively, one can derive the equations of motion written in terms of the mean field\nand fluctuation directly from: i\u03a6\u0307 = \u03b4h\u0124 \u2032i/\u03b4(\u03a6\u2217 ) and i\u03a6\u0307\u2217 = \u2212\u03b4h\u0124 \u2032 i/\u03b4\u03a6. Here, h\u0124 \u2032 i is the\nexpectation value of the effective Hamiltonian \u0124 \u2032 = \u0124 \u2212 \u03bcN\u0302.

Uniform condensate\nIn this section, we consider a simple uniform system, neglecting external confining potential, Vext = 0, in order to illustrate how our method works. In this case, the condensate\n12\n\n\fis spatially uniform: \u03a6(x) = \u03a60 and all mode functions are reduced to simple plane waves.\nThe indices \u03b1 are regarded as momenta k and the mode functions u and v may be written\nas\n\n1\n1\nu\u03b1 \u2212\u2192 uk (x) = \u221a eik*x uk ,\nv\u03b1 \u2212\u2192 vk (x) = \u221a eik*x vk ,\n(6.1)\nV\nV\nwhere V is the volume of the system.

For simplicity, we consider the ground\nstate, nk = 0 for all k 6= 0 and assume that \u03a60 is real.

For small |k|, with g > 0, the phonon dispersion relation \u03c9 = ck is obtained, where\nthe sound velocity c is\ns\ng|\u03a60 |2\n.\n(6.14)\nc=\nm\nThis is the well-known result of the Bogoliubov theory.\nThe appearance of the phonon dispersion relation is a consequence of spontaneous breakdown of the continuous U(1) symmetry of the Hamiltonian associated with the phase change\nof the bose field: \u03c8(x) \u2192 ei\u03b4 \u03c8(x). The phonon can be regarded as a Nambu-Goldstone mode\n\nof the broken U(1) (or O(2)) symmetry.\nOur formula (6.6) for the spectrum of the mode functions with the Gaussian fluctuation,\nhowever, does not reproduce phonon spectrum, but instead exhibits a gap at k \u2192 0, violating\nGoldstone's theorem. This shortcoming is rather inherent in the Gaussian wave functional\n\napproach, \u2217) but this defect can be remedied by computing the excitation spectrum. 8)\nWe now turn our discussion on the removal of divergences. The expression (6.4) for the\nfluctuations in the reduced density matrix actually contain a divergent integral, and so does\nthe gap equation (6.9). To see this explicitly, we observe that at large |k|,\nEk \u2243 Wk \u2212\n\n|\u2206|2\n2Wk\n\n(6.15)\n\nAccording to the classification of Hohenberg and Martin 27) , our approximation corresponds to the\nconserving (or \u03a6-derivable 28) ) approximation, as opposed to the gapless approximation 29) . The origin of the\nviolation of the Goldstone theorem is traced back to the \"Fock\" term which may be suppressed by keeping\nthe leading term in the 1/N expansion 30) for a system with O(N) symmetry. 31)\n\u2217)\n\n14\n\n\f\u0081~\n\n\u0081~\n\n\u0081~\n\n\u0081~\n\nFig. 3.

The \"renormalized gap equation\" (6.20) is one of our new findings in this paper.\n\n\u00a77. Summary\nIn this paper we have formulated the variational method to describe the dynamics of\nthe Bose-Einstein condentate interacting via short-range effective interaction. With the\nGaussian variational wave functional we have derived the equations of motion which consist\n15\n\n\fof a generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation for the condensate and a Liouville-von Neumann\nequation for the density matrix of the quantum and thermal fluctuations. The static solutions\nof these equations are examined in terms of the mode functions for the fluctuations. In the\ncase of uniform condensate, these mode functions are reduced to simple plane waves, and\nwe are able to perform the calculation explicitly. We have shown that the spectrum of the\nmode functions reduces to the Bogoliubov phonon spectrum when we neglect the effect of\nquantum fluctuations; it does not contain however phonon mode in the presence of quantum\nfluctuation. In these calcuations we have shown that the divergent integrals which arise due\nto the use of singular effective interaction can be eliminated systematically by removing the\nrepeated pair scattering terms to avoid the double counting of the diagrams in terms of the\nbare interaction. In the forthcoming paper, we will show how to apply the present method\nto compute the linear response of the system to external perturbation and to extract the\nphonon dispersion relation of the collective excitations in the sytem.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Prof. Gordon Baym for calling our attention to the ref. 14) concerning the\nphysical interpretation of the removal of divergences.
