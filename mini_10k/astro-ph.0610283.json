On average, I Zw 1\nis \u223c 35 per cent dimmer in 2005 than in the shorter (20 ks) 2002 observation. Between the\ntwo epochs the intrinsic absorption column density diminished, but there were also subtle\nchanges in the continuum shape. Considering the blurred ionised reflection model, the longterm changes can be associated with a varying contribution of the power law component\nrelative to the total spectrum. Examination of normalised light curves indicates that the highenergy variations are quite structured and that there are delays, but only in some parts of\nthe light curve. Interestingly, a hard X-ray lag first appears during the most-distinct structure\nin the mean light curve, a flux dip \u223c 25 ks into the observation. The previously discovered\nbroad, ionised Fe K\u03b1 line shows significant variations over the course of the 2005 observation. The amplitude of the variations is 25 \u2212 45 per cent and they are unlikely due to changes\nin the Fe K\u03b1-producing region, but perhaps arise from orbital motion around the black hole\nor obscuration in the broad iron line-emitting region. The 2002 data are re-examined for variability of the Fe K\u03b1 line at that epoch. There is evidence of energy and flux variations that are\nassociated with a hard X-ray flare that occurred during that observation.\nKey words: galaxies: active \u2013 galaxies: nuclei \u2013 quasars: individual: I Zw 1 \u2013 X-ray: galaxies\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\nI Zwicky 1 (I Zw 1; z = 0.0611) is considered the prototypical\nnarrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy (NLS1) mainly due to its distinct optical properties. At X-ray energies the active galactic nucleus (AGN)\nexhibits behaviour that is somewhat more modest than for typical NLS1s (e.g. Leighly 1999a, 1999b). However, a short (20 ks)\nXMM-Newton observation conducted in 2002 revealed a plethora of\ninteresting characteristics, such as: hard X-ray flaring, unresolved\ntransition array (UTA) absorption, and possibly multiple Fe K\u03b1\nemission lines (Gallo et al. 2004a, hereafter G04).\nThe discoveries in G04 prompted further examination with a\nsecond longer XMM-Newton observation. This is the first of three\npapers which describe the X-ray properties of I Zw 1 utilising all\nXMM-Newton data. In this work, we present an 85 ks XMM-Newton\nobservation and describe the mean spectral and timing characteristics of the AGN, as well as compare the data to the earlier 2002\n\nobservation. The complex ionised absorber and its long-term variability is discussed in detail in the work of Costantini et al. (2007).\nIn addition, I Zw 1 exhibits remarkable short-term spectral variability during the 2005 observation. This is presented in Gallo et\nal. (2007).\n\n2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION\nI Zw 1 was observed for the second time by XMM-Newton (Jansen\net al. 2001) on 2005 July 18\u201319 during revolution 1027 (obsid\n0300470101) (hereafter we will refer to this as the 2005 observation). The total duration was 85 ks, during which time all instruments were functioning normally. The EPIC pn (Str\u00fcder et al. 2001)\nand MOS (MOS1 and MOS2; Turner et al. 2001) cameras were operated in small-window mode with the medium filter in place. The\nReflection Grating Spectrometers (RGS1 and RGS2; den Herder\n\n\f3 2005 X-RAY LIGHT CURVES\nDuring the 20 ks 2002 observation I Zw 1 exhibited a modest Xray flare, which lasted a total of \u223c 5 ks (G04). Notably the flare\nappeared to be quite hard, concentrated in the 3 \u2212 12 keV band,\nthus inducing spectral variability. Aside from this lone event the\nlight curve was relatively quiet in comparison to many NLS1.\nThe 2005 light curve appears more active, consistently variable with, on average, larger amplitudes than observed in 2002\n(Figure 1). Perhaps the most interesting event in the light curve\nis the sharp drop about 25 ks into the observation. There is spectral\nvariability related to the light curve, and this is discussed at length\nin Gallo et al. (2007). Here, we will focus on the flux variations.\nLight curves were created in three EPIC pn energy bands:\n0.2 \u2212 0.7 keV, 2 \u2212 3 keV and 3 \u2212 12 keV. Using the light\ncurves in 1000 s bins, each of the high-energy light curves was\n\n4\n3\n\n-1\n\ncounts s\n\n2\n1\n0\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\nTime (s)\n\nCCF\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n\nCCF\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n\nFigure 1. The 2005 0.2 \u2212 12 keV EPIC pn light curve in 200 s bins. The\nstart time corresponds to the beginning of the pn exposure.\n\nCCF\n\net al. 2001) also collected data during this time, as did the Optical\nMonitor (OM; Mason et al. 2001).\nThe Observation Data Files (ODFs) from the 2002 and 2005\nobservations were processed to produce calibrated event lists using the XMM-Newton Science Analysis System (SAS v7.0.0).\nUnwanted hot, dead, or flickering pixels were removed as were\nevents due to electronic noise. Event energies were corrected for\ncharge-transfer inefficiencies. EPIC response matrices were generated using the SAS tasks ARFGEN and RMFGEN. Light curves\nwere extracted from these event lists to search for periods of high\nbackground flaring. Some background flaring is detected toward\nthe end of the 2005 observation, and the data during those periods have been neglected. The total amount of good exposure time\nselected was 58 ks and 82 ks for the pn and MOS detectors, respectively. Source photons were extracted from a circular region 35\u2032\u2032\nacross and centred on the source. The background photons were extracted from a larger off-source region and appropriately scaled to\nthe source-selection region. Single and double events were selected\nfor the pn detector, and single-quadruple events were selected for\nthe MOS. The data quality flag was set to zero (i.e. events next to a\nCCD edge or bad pixel were omitted). The total number of source\ncounts collected by the pn instrument in the 0.3\u221210 keV range was\napproximately 2.75 \u00d7 105 . In the 0.5 \u2212 10 keV band, the MOS instruments collected about 8.4\u00d7104 (MOS1) and 8.9\u00d7104 (MOS2)\nsource counts. Comparing the source and background spectra we\nfound that the spectra are source dominated between 0.2 \u2212 12 keV.\nThe EPIC pn spectrum is analysed in the 0.3 \u2212 10 keV band where\nthe calibration is most certain. To avoid cross-calibration uncertainties at low energies, the MOS spectra are neglected below 0.5 keV.\nThe 2005 spectra from all instruments show relatively good agreement in these energy bands, within known calibration uncertainties\n(Kirsch 2006), so they are fitted simultaneously unless stated otherwise. As the broad-band light curve is less sensitive to calibration\nuncertainties, the data between 0.2 \u2212 12 keV are utilised.\nThe RGS were operated in standard Spectro+Q mode in 2005,\nand a total exposure of 85 ks was collected. The RGS data are used\nin the analysis of the ionised absorber in I Zw 1 (Costantini et al.\n2007) and will not be discussed here.\nDuring 2005, I Zw 1 was observed with the OM in Fast-mode\nthrough four filters (U , U V W 1, U V W 2 and U V M 2). The purpose was to examine possible optical variability. Unfortunately, the\nAGN was not well centred in the small, fast-mode frame and fell\nclose to the detector edge. Consequently, optical variability could\nnot be examined in a robust manner.\n\n5\n\nL. C.

Both higher bands are dominated by\nthe power law component alone.\nThere are a few AGN where time delays as a function of\nFourier frequency (see Nowak et al. 1999 and references therein\n\n\f3\n\n0.6\n\nCCF\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n1\n\nNormalised counts s\n\n-1\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nA longer XMM-Newton look at I Zw 1\n\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\n-3000\n\n-2000\n\n-1000\n\nFigure 3.

A hard band lag appears\nmore dominant in this time band and peaks at \u223c 1 ks.\n\n4 2005 SPECTRAL MODELLING\nfor details) have been determined (see Papadakis et al. 2001 for the\nfirst reported detection in an AGN). If there were a single delay between the light curves in the various energy bands, then the time\ndelay between all of the Fourier frequencies would be the same. In\ncontrast, what is typically observed is that as the frequency of the\nFourier components decreases, the delays increase. Furthermore, as\nthe energy band separation between two light curves increases, the\ndelays, at the same frequency, also increase (e.g. see Ar\u00e9valo et al.\n2006 for a recent discussion).\nIn the case of I Zw 1, we cannot estimate time lags as a function of frequency due to limited signal in the hard-band light curve.\nHowever, the CCFs are consistent with what we observe in other\nAGN and NLS1. The CCFs show broad humps around zero time\nlag with an asymmetry toward positive lags, but not a single, distinct delay. This is consistent with the hypothesis that in I Zw 1,\njust like in other Seyferts, the sine and cosine functions in the hardband light curves are delayed with respect to those in the soft-band\nlight curves, but the delay is not the same for all of them: the delays increase with decreasing frequency and increased separation\nbetween the energy bands.\nOf interest may be the particularly small values measured in\nthe CCFs (0.5 \u2212 0.7). We examine this further by directly comparing light curves in each energy band normalised to their respective mean (Figure 3). Most obvious in the comparison between the\n0.2 \u2212 0.7 keV and 3 \u2212 12 keV band is the significance of the delay\nbetween \u223c 25\u221252 ks (vertical dashed lines in Fig. 3). In particular,\nthe delay seemingly begins at the onset of the sharp dip in the light\ncurve. If we calculate the CCF in this time regime alone we see a\nclear dominant lag at \u223c 1 ks (Figure 4).\nHowever, as Figure 3 demonstrates, the lag is not always\npresent. Sometimes there are no delays, and at other times the light\ncurves show different behaviour and even anti-correlations (e.g.\n\u223c 20\u221225 ks and > 75 ks into the observation). All of these factors\ncontribute to the small value of the CCF peaks. Similar behaviour\nwas seen in the NLS1 IRAS 13224\u20133809 (Gallo et al. 2004b) where\nthe authors suggested possible alternating lags between high- and\nlow-energy bands (i.e. sometimes hard band lags and other times it\nleads).\n\nThe source spectra were grouped such that each bin contained at\nleast 20 counts (typically more). Spectral fitting was performed\nusing XSPEC v11.3.0 (Arnaud 1996). All parameters are reported in the rest frame of the source unless specified otherwise.\nThe quoted errors on the model parameters correspond to a 90%\nconfidence level for one interesting parameter (i.e. a \u2206\u03c72 = 2.7\ncriterion). A value for the Galactic column density toward I Zw 1\nof 5.07 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 (Elvis et al. 1989) is adopted in all of the\nspectral fits. K-corrected luminosities are calculated using a Hubble\nconstant of H0 =70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 and a standard flat cosmology\nwith \u03a9M = 0.3 and \u03a9\u039b = 0.7.\nIn the analysis of the 2002 data, G04 were able to fit the spectra with various phenomenological models, but could not distinguish a superior one. While they were able to establish that a second, soft component was a necessary part of the continuum they\nwere unable to determine whether the soft excess was curved (e.g.\nblackbody-like) or flat (power law-like).\n\n4.1 The 2-10 keVspectra\nAs was done for the 2002 data (G04), we built-up a broad-band\nspectral model for the 2005 observation utilising all the EPIC data.\nFitting the 2 \u2212 10 keV EPIC spectra with a single power law (each\ninstrument having free photon index (\u0393) and normalisation to accommodate existing cross-calibration uncertainties) resulted in a\nsatisfactory model (\u03c72\u03bd /dof = 1.03/1090). Adding a Gaussian\nprofile to this continuum, with a common energy (E) and width\n(\u03c3) among all three instruments was a significant improvement\n(\u2206\u03c72 = 59.5 for 5 free additional parameters). The best fit line\nparameters were E = 6.70 \u00b1 0.14 keV, \u03c3 = 523+276\n\u2212157 eV and\n+130\nEWpn = 265+105\n,\nEW\n=\n220\n,\nEW\n=\n239+191\nM\n1\nM\n2\n\u221232\n\u221249\n\u221279 eV.\nG04 introduced the possibility of multiple line features in the\nFe K\u03b1 region of the 2002 spectrum, including an intrinsically narrow 6.4 keV line. No such line is present in the 2005 spectrum. A\nnarrow, neutral line is completely insignificant in the pn spectrum\nand any such feature in the MOS has an EW < 27 eV.\nA comparable improvement (\u2206\u03c72 = 38.0 for 5 free addi-\n\n\fL. C.

These residuals are apparent in all\nbroad-band fits to the 2005 data (see also Figure 7 and the lower\npanel of Figure 8) , with the exception of the double power law\nmodel. The most likely cause is the significant spectral variability\nexhibited by I Zw 1 in 2005 (Gallo et al. 2007). Gallo et al. suggest\nthat the power law photon index could be changing during the 2005\nobservation, which would explain the difficulty in fitting the average spectrum with a single power law. The reason that the residuals\nare minimal in the double power law model could simply be that\nthe second power law does not begin to dominate the spectrum until rather high energies (\u223c 5.5 keV in the pn spectrum).\nBased on the blackbody plus power law model, the average\n0.3 \u2212 10 keV flux during 2005, corrected for Galactic absorption,\nis \u223c 1.4 \u00d7 10\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 . The luminosities in the 0.3 \u2212\n10 keV and 2 \u2212 10 keV bands are 1.28 \u00d7 1044 erg s\u22121 and 0.43 \u00d7\n1044 erg s\u22121 , respectively. I Zw 1 is \u223c 35 per cent dimmer than it\nwas in 2002. For comparison, the estimated 2 \u2212 10 keV luminosity\nduring the ASCA observation was 0.53 \u00d7 1044 erg s\u22121 (Leighly\n1999b).\n\n5 A COMPARISON OF THE 2002 AND 2005 SPECTRA\n5.1 Summary of the 2002 observation\n\ntional parameters) can be achieved if a disc line profile (Fabian\net al. 1989) rather than a Gaussian profile is used for the broad\nresiduals. In this case the best-fit energy and inner disc radius are\nE = 6.55+0.20\n\u22120.10 keV and Rin = 6 \u2212 26 gravitational radii, respectively. The disc inclination (i) is fixed at 50\u25e6 , to remain consistent\nwith our finding in Section 6.1. Leaving the parameter free to vary\ndoes not enhance the fit statistics, nor does it affect the best-fit line\nenergy. The line strength is EW \u2248 200 eV in each spectrum. For\nsimplicity, we adopt the Gaussian profile.\n\n4.2 Simple broad-band models\nExtrapolating the 2 \u2212 10 keV fit to 0.3 keV in the pn and 0.5 keV\nin the two MOS left a gradual rise in the residuals that is typically\nassociated with the soft excess.\nThe entire 2005 0.3\u221210 keV band was modelled with various\ncontinuum models. Through repeated effort we found it necessary\nto include in all models an additional neutral absorber at the redshift\nof the source, as well as a low-energy (\u223c 650 eV) absorption edge\nthat mimics the more complicated ionised absorption.\nAs with the 2002 observation, the 2005 data show that a second continuum component is required to fit the spectrum of I Zw 1\n(see Table 1). According to an F -test, the addition of a second continuum component (i.e. 2 additional parameters) to a single power\nlaw is highly significant (F -test probability \u223c 10\u221217 ). Also like\nthe 2002 observation, a single superior model does not stand out.\nHowever, there are similarities among all the models in Table 1.\nOne may notice that the second component is not highly curved.\nEven in the case of the blackbody plus power law model, the hightemperature of the blackbody component will give it a flatter appearance in the EPIC bandpass.\nOf interest is that there is detectable diminishing of the intrinsic column density in I Zw 1 since 2002. The exact change depends\non what continuum model is assumed, but appears to be at least on\nthe 50 per cent level.\nThe residuals from the blackbody plus power law fit are shown\nin Figure 5. Notable in Figure 5 are the positive residuals, which re-\n\nThe 0.2 \u2212 10 keV spectrum of I Zw 1 has long been known to\ndiffer from those of other NLS1. It possesses a rather weak soft\nexcess and is modified by intrinsic neutral and ionised absorption.\nThe 2002 observation of I Zw 1 (G04) was rather typical of what\nhad been seen previously (e.g. Leighly 1999a, b).\nThere were several simple continuum models (e.g. blackbody plus power law, broken power laws, multiple blackbodies\nplus power law) that when modified by intrinsic ionised absorption (an absorption-edge), neutral absorption (absorption column\ndensity) and an Fe K\u03b1 emission line, fit the EPIC spectra adequately in 2002. None of these continuum models stood out as superior. Since the 2002 data were reprocessed with the newest calibration we refit the simple models to the newly processed data\nand find comparable results. The one modification was in the intrinsic absorption column density, which was slightly lower with\nthe new calibration (NH = 4.5 \u00b1 0.5 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 as opposed to\nNH = 10.0 \u00b1 0.1 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 ).\nA particularly interesting spectral result from the 2002 observation was the possible presence of multiple iron lines. In addition\nto a broad and ionised line, the spectrum also required a narrow, unresolved emission line at 6.4 keV . The most obvious interpretation\nadopted by G04 was that this feature was produced in distant material such as the torus, but an alternative interpretation is offered in\nSect 8.4.2.\n\n5.2 Spectral changes since 2002\nThe 2005 spectrum does appear substantially different from the\n2002 observation. The broad-band differences between 2002 and\n2005 can be depicted by extrapolating the best-fit 2\u221210 keV power\nlaw to both spectra down to lower energies (Figure 6).\nThe 2005 observation shows a much softer spectrum, a suggestion that the level of absorption may have changed since 2002.\nThe best-fitting power law in the 2 \u2212 10 keV band is slightly flatter in 2005 (\u0393 = 2.15 \u00b1 0.02 compared to \u0393 = 2.28 \u00b1 0.03 in\n2002), which likely also contributes to the apparently stronger soft\nexcess at that epoch.

Since the model is complex, to simplify\nthe fitting process the normalisations of the MOS spectra were\nlinked to the pn spectrum and only a constant scale factor was used\nto correct for possible flux offsets between instruments. The incident spectrum for the reflection component was linked to that of the\npower law component.\nThe fit quality is not as satisfactory as some of the simple models (\u03c72\u03bd /dof = 1.10/1627), but it does have the advantage of offering a physical explanation for the origin of the soft excess and\nbroad Fe K\u03b1 line.

The fraction of reflected-to-total flux in the 0.3 \u2212 10 keV range (corrected\nfor Galactic and source absorption) is \u223c 0.30. Drawing conclusions from the fit parameters should probably be done with caution given the complexity of the low-energy absorption. However,\nit can be noted that the disc inner radius is not extremely small\n(Rin = 5.0+8.2\n\u22121.6 rg ) and the emissivity profile is not very steep\n(\u03b1 = 2.48+0.36\n\u22120.31 ). Both points suggest that the reflection component\ndoes not necessarily originate from the innermost confines around\nthe black hole as is suggested for many NLS1.\nThe advantage of this model is that it can account for the iron\nemission and soft excess in a self-consistent manner. Moreover, as\nwill be discussed in Gallo et al. (2007), this reflection scenario can\npotentially explain some of the complicated spectral variability exhibited by I Zw 1.\n\n6.2 Simultaneous fit to the 2002 and 2005 data\nBased on the investigation in Section 5.2, most of the spectral differences between 2002 and 2005 can be associated with changes\nin the level of absorption. However, there do appear to be subtle\nchanges in the shape of the continuum as well. As I Zw 1 was\nnearly twice as bright in 2002, in terms of the blurred reflection\nmodel the changes in the continuum shape could be interpreted as\ndiffering contributions from the direct power law component.\nThe data from both epochs were fitted simultaneously to examine consistency in the reflection scenario. For simplicity, many\nparameters were fixed to the best-fit 2005 values (see Table 3).\nThe primary parameters that were left free for each dataset were\nthe power law and absorption parameters, and the normalisation of\nthe reflection component. The iron abundance and disc inclination\nwere linked between the two spectra as large changes in these parameters would not be expected over 3-years. A reasonable fit can\nbe achieved (\u03c72\u03bd /dof = 1.06/1480) in this manner (see Figure 8\nand Table 3).\nAs is seen in Table 3 there is no strong indication for a change\nin the shape of the direct power law component between 2002 and\n2005. In addition, most of the blurring and reflection parameters\nhave been fixed. The most notable changes are in the amount of\n\n\fA longer XMM-Newton look at I Zw 1\n\n7\n\nTable 3.

The time resolution is 5 ks, and the spectra are binned into 250 eV wide channels. The bright band between 5.8 \u2212\n6.7 keV corresponds to the broad emission line seen in the mean spectrum.\nThe feature appears to be variable over the course of the observation.\n\n0\n\nIn the analysis of G04 there were indications that the broad feature\nin the 2002 observation was composed of multiple (at least two)\nnarrower emission lines. In the 2005 observation, the residuals can\nbe fit by a single Gaussian profile. Based on the width of the line\n(\u03c3 = 523+276\n\u2212157 eV) in the EPIC spectra, the line-emitting region is\nbetween 12 \u2212 66 rg . Similar distance estimates come from the disc\nline fit and the blurred reflection model. Given the long observation and proximity of the line emitting region makes it plausible to\nsearch for line variability.\nThe mean pn spectrum was divided into 17 segments, each\nof 5 ks. The exposure in each segment was \u223c 3.5 ks, taking account of the live-time of the pn camera in small window mode. The\naverage number of source counts in the 5.0 \u2212 7.2 keV band was\nslightly more than 300. The counts were grouped into spectra such\nthat each bin contained at least 20 counts. For each 5 ks spectrum\nthe continuum was determined by fitting the 4 \u2212 10 keV band with\na power law, while excluding the 5 \u2212 7.2 keV range. The omitted\nband was replaced and the spectrum was rebinned into channels\nof 250 eV. Excess counts above the continuum in each 250 eV bin\nwere recorded. From this information an excess residual image was\ncreated as illustrated in Iwasawa et al. (2004; and in prep). The result is analogous to modelling each spectrum with a power law plus\nGaussian profile and measuring the flux in the Gaussian component. The advantage of creating an excess residual image is that we\n\n0.4\n\n-5\n\n7.1 FeK\u03b1 variability during the 2005 observation\n\n0.8\n\n-1\n\n7 IRON LINE VARIABILITY\n\n10 ph s cm\n\n-2\n\n1.2\n\nabsorption (as noted in previous fits and by Costantini et al. 2007),\nthe reflection fraction (R, fraction of reflected emission to power\nlaw emission in the 0.3\u221210 keV band), and in the level at which the\nreflection component contributes to the total 0.3\u221210 keV spectrum\n(FR = 0.22 \u00b1 0.03 in 2002 and 0.31 \u00b1 0.03 in 2005).\n\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\nTime (s)\n\nFigure 10.

A positive delay\nindicates that the continuum changes lead the emission line variations.\n\nimages were derived were simulated for identical conditions as the\n2005 observation, assuming a power law plus stationary Gaussian\nprofile. The uncertainty in the observed light curve was taken to be\nthe standard deviation in the excess counts resulting from the simulated images. Details of the process including caveats are discussed\nin Iwasawa et al. (2004).\nThe Fe K\u03b1 light curve shows clear variability (Figure 10) with\na constant fit being unacceptable (\u03c72\u03bd = 2.45). The fractional variability amplitude (Fvar , using uncertainties derived in Edelson et\nal. 2002) is 34.8 \u00b1 9.7 per cent.\nA light curve of the 6 \u2212 10 keV continuum was generated\nbased on the power law fits used to derive the Fe K\u03b1 light curve.\nThe uncertainties in the 6 \u2212 10 keV flux were assumed to be the\nsame as the uncertainty in the corresponding count rate. The continuum light curve, normalised to its average flux, is shown in Figure 11 with the broad-line flux light curve (Figure 10), normalised\nto its average flux, overplotted as a dashed curve. Interestingly, the\n\ncurves appear to be anti-correlated in some parts of the light curve.\nCross-correlating the broad-line and 6 \u2212 10 keV continuum light\ncurves indicates a weak correlation with the broad-line light curve\nlagging the continuum fluctuations by \u223c 15 ks (lower panel Figure 11).\nThe fractional variability in the 6 \u2212 10 keV continuum is\nFvar = 20.8 \u00b1 4.0 per cent, less than the Fvar in the Fe K\u03b1 line.\nStatistically, the amplitude of the continuum variations is consistent with the Fe K\u03b1 variations within about 2-\u03c3. However, the difference is likely larger since the uncertainties on Fvar are conservatively over-estimated (Edelson et al. 2002).\n7.2 Revisiting the Fe K\u03b1 variability in 2002\nIn fitting the spectra in various segments of the 2002 observation, G04 found little evidence of intensity variations in the broadline. We take advantage of the excess-residual technique to reexamine the broad-line variability in the 2002 observation. An\nexcess-residual image has been created for the 2002 pn observation in a nearly identical manner as was done for the 2005 observation. The only difference is that the time resolution is slightly\nbetter during 2002 because the mean spectrum was divided into 6\nsegments of 3.6 ks each (rather than 5 ks). This can be done without degrading the data quality because the I Zw 1 was brighter in\n2002 and because the observation was conducted in large-window\nmode, which has a CCD live-time of \u223c 95 per cent; therefore the\nactual exposure in each segment of the 2002 observation is almost\nthe same as the exposure in each segment of the 2005 data.\nThe 2002 excess-residual image is shown in Figure 12. The\nbroad-line is dominant in the 6.0 \u2212 6.5 keV range, but there is also\napparent brightening that occurs in the 5.5\u22126.0 keV band between\n10\u221215 ks. This is of particular interest because the continuum light\ncurve shows a hard X-ray flare that peaks during this time interval\n(see G04).\n\n\f1.5\n1\n0.5\n\nNormalised flux\n\n2\n\nA longer XMM-Newton look at I Zw 1\n\n0\n\n5000\n\n10000\n\n15000\n\n20000\n\nTime (s)\n\nFigure 13. Various light curves from the 2002 observation of I Zw 1\nnormalised to their respective averages. The black, dashed curve is the\n3 \u2212 12 keV continuum light curve highlighting the hard X-ray flare reported previously by G04 (uncertainties in the curve are found in G04). The\nfilled, red circles connected by a solid line mark the light curve extracted\nfrom the residual image (Figure 12) in the 5.5 \u2212 6.0 keV range (i.e. the red\nline). The peak intensity in the red line corresponds with the peak intensity\nin the 3 \u2212 12 keV continuum light curve. The open, blue squares connected\nby a dotted line is the light curve extracted from the residual image in the\n6.0 \u2212 6.5 keV band (i.e. the blue line).\n\nLight curves were extracted from the excess-residual image in\nthe 6.0 \u2212 6.5 keV (blue line) and 5.5 \u2212 6.0 keV (red line) bands.\nThey were then normalised to their respective means and plotted with the normalised 2002 3 \u2212 12 keV continuum light curve\n(Figure 13). As the observation was so short uncertainties in the\nresidual-image light curves were not derived in a robust manner as\nwas done for the 2005 data. We also note that propagation of Poisson uncertainties in each data bin yields very large error bars (on\nthe order of 100 per cent), therefore we are only illustrating a trend\nin Figure 13.\nThe light curves suggest that the variations are more intense in\nthe 5.5 \u2212 6.0 keV-line than in the 6.0 \u2212 6.5 keV-line. There also is\nno obvious connection between the 6.0 \u2212 6.5 keV-line light curve\nand that of the continuum. On the other hand, the 5.5 \u2212 6.0 keV\nvariations appear to be well correlated with the high-energy continuum variations and, despite the unknown size of the true error bars\nin the 5.5 \u2212 6.0 keV-line light curve, the trend is obvious.\n\n8 DISCUSSION\n\n9\n\nNLS1s and I Zw 1 does not exhibit all these qualities to noticeable\nlevels. In fact, in some instances I Zw 1 even displays behaviour\nthat is atypical of the class. For example, I Zw 1 is observed through\na column density intrinsic to the AGN. This is unusual for NLS1s\n(e.g. Boller, Brandt & Fink 1996), but also for type 1 AGN in general.\nThe soft excess emission above the underlying steep power\nlaw is weak in I Zw 1 compared to most NLS1s, and not because of\nthe relatively high intrinsic absorption (e.g. Leighly 1999b, Tanaka\net al. 2005). Even the clear detection of a broad Fe K\u03b1 emission\nline in I Zw 1 seems unusual given that NLS1s appear not to show\nbroad emission lines so obviously (e.g. Fabian et al. 2002, 2004;\nGuainazzi et al. 2006).\nThe identification of I Zw 1 as the prototype NLS1 originated\ndue to its well-studied optical properties, but it now lingers mainly\nas a historic perspective. It can even be argued that some of its Xray properties are atypical of the norm.\n\n8.2 Time lags\nThe average CCFs calculated in Section 3 show a tendency for positive lags (hard band following soft band). This phenomenon has\nbeen observed in other AGN (e.g. Ar\u00e9valo et al. 2006 and references therein) and Galactic black holes (e.g. McClintock & Remillard 2005). However the origin of the lags is not certain.\nIn a simple corona with a uniform temperature and optical\ndepth, variations can result from fluctuations in the intensity of the\nseed photons. Variations of this nature should produce fixed delays\nbetween low- and high-energy bands, resulting in a common time\ndelay for all Fourier components. We do not estimate time lags as\na function of frequency in I Zw 1; however the broad, asymmetric\nCCFs suggest that we do not have a single, well defined delay between the various energy bands. Examination of normalised light\ncurves in different energy bands further supports this. A time lag\nis only seen in parts of the light curves. In fact, at times the light\ncurves are not correlated, or are actually anti-correlated.\nLags are seen in Cyg X-1, which can be attributed to spectral evolution in magnetic flares as they detach from the accretion\ndisc (e.g. Poutanen & Fabian 1999). Another possibility is that the\nlags are manifested by material that propagates toward the black\nhole from regions of soft X-ray emission to regions of hard X-ray\nemission (e.g. B\u00f6ttcher & Liang 1999; Kotov et al. 2001).\nBased on the observation of another\nNLS1,\nIRAS 13224+3809, Gallo et al. (2004b) claimed a lag that\nalternated (sometimes hard band followed other times it led), with\npossible dependency on the average flux of the source. There is\nlikely similar behaviour here as the first notable lag coincides with\na sharp flux dip in the light curve about 25 ks into the observation.\n\n8.1 I Zw 1: a not so prototypical NLS1 in X-rays?\nThe strong Fe II emission in the optical spectrum of I Zw 1 was\nnoted a half century ago (Sargent 1968), and given the intensity\nand narrowness of the lines the AGN became a laboratory for Fe II\nstudies (e.g. Phillips 1976, 1977, 1978; Boroson & Green 1992;\nLaor et al. 1997; Vestergaard & Wilkes 2001). Its narrow Balmer\nlines were also noted fairly early on (e.g. Oke & Lauer 1979).\nWhen a formal definition of the NLS1 class was established\n(Osterbrock & Pogge 1985), based on optical spectral properties,\nit was realised that I Zw 1 was already the best-studied member of\nthis class of AGN, likely leading to its labelling as the prototype\nNLS1. However, some X-ray properties are also characteristic of\n\n8.3 Diminished neutral absorption since 2002\nSignificant variations in the low-energy spectra of some Seyfert 1\ngalaxies have been previously observed and interpreted as changes\nin the low-energy continuum component (e.g. Page et al. 2002,\nStarling et al. 2004). In the case of I Zw 1, this does not appear\nto be the most straightforward explanation. There is detectable diminishing of the intrinsic column density in I Zw 1 since 2002. The\nexact change depends on what continuum model is assumed, but\nappears to be at least on the 50 per cent level.\nChanges in the neutral column density have been reported in\nseveral type 2 (i.e. absorbed) AGN (e.g. Risaliti et al. 2002), but to\n\n\f10\n\nL. C. Gallo et al.\n\nthe best of our knowledge not in a NLS1. I Zw 1 is a merging and\nstarburst system so there are several sources of absorption that exist\nin the galaxy and could feasibly change (e.g. due to bulk motion\nor dissipation of an absorbing component) over the span of a few\nyears, which separates the two observations.\n8.4 Origin of the Fe K\u03b1 variability\n8.4.1 Flux variations in the 2005 observation\nThe broad Fe K\u03b1 line in I Zw 1 shows remarkable short-term variability. Understanding the origin of this variability is challenging.\nFigure 11 suggests that the emission line and continuum variations could be correlated if we consider the iron-line fluctuations\nto lag the continuum by 10 \u2212 12 ks. Such a delay would place the\niron-line emitting region at approximately 180 rg in I Zw 1. The\ndistance is too large to account for the width of the iron feature\nwhich based on various spectral fits (e.g. Gaussian profile, disc line\nprofile, blurred ionised reflector), originates within about 60 rg . A\nsecond problem is that the amplitude of the variations appears to\nbe larger in the Fe K\u03b1 line than in the 6 \u2212 10 keV continuum that\nwould be producing it. Even if we assume that the amplitudes of\nthe variations are identical, it would be unlikely that all of the incident continuum will be reprocessed by the iron producing region\nand then emitted back into our line-of-sight.\nAnother possibility is that the variations are a result of some\nextrinsic effect rather than intrinsic changes in the line-emitting region. For example, motion within the accretion disc could account\nfor some of the flux changes (e.g. Iwasawa et al. 2004). In this\ncase, one would expect energy modulation in the excess residual\nmap, which are not present in Figure 9. However, the strength of\nthe modulations is dependent on the distance of the line-emitting\nregion from the black hole and the disc inclination. It could be that\nin I Zw 1 this combination of parameters does not generate observable modulations.\nIn a speculative approach, we fit the Fe K\u03b1 line light curve\n(Figure 10) with a sine curve. The fit was statistically good (\u03c72\u03bd =\n1.02) and the implied period was 49.1 ks. If the 49.1 ks corresponds to the orbital period of the emitting region around the black\nhole, then we can estimate the distance (e.g. following Bardeen et\nal. 1972) to be \u223c 25 rg . This distance is consistent with that estimated from the width of the broad Fe K\u03b1 line in the spectral models, but it is not clear why only the line-emitting region is affected\nin this manner and not the continuum.\nFinally, the Fe K\u03b1 variations could be due to variations in\nsome optically-thick absorber in the line-emitting region. Such obscuring material could be created from instabilities in the accretion\ndisc of highly inhomogeneous flows (e.g. Merloni et al. 2006).\n8.4.2 Energy and flux variations in the 2002 observation\nThe most impressive feature in the 2002 continuum light curve of\nI Zw 1 was a modest X-ray flare concentrated in the 3 \u2212 12 keV\nband. The 6.0 \u2212 6.5 keV line-emission is not particularly variable\nand demonstrates no connection to the continuum variations. This\nbehaviour is typical of other results (e.g. Iwasawa et al. 2004).\nHowever, the 5.5 \u2212 6.0 keV line-emission exhibits more intense\nvariations which mimic the continuum light curve. In particular,\nthe peak intensity in the 5.5 \u2212 6.0 keV-line light curve corresponds\nwell with the peak of the hard X-ray flare.\nDue to limited data, examination of time-resolved spectra during 2002 do not yield significant results. The likely correlation be-\n\ntween the continuum and 5.5 \u2212 6.0 keV-line light curve suggests\nthat this is emission due to Fe K\u03b1, which is produced in a spot on\nthe accretion disc that is illuminated by the X-ray flare (i.e. perhaps\nco-rotating with the disc). The 6.0\u22126.5 keV-line emission is representative of the average broad-line emission, which is produced at\ndistances of \u223c 35 rg as suggested by its width. The 5.5 \u2212 6.0 keVline emission and hard X-ray flare are generated closer to the black\nhole where Doppler and gravitational effects are more intense than\nthe region where the 6.0 \u2212 6.5 keV emission line is produced (i.e.\n< 35 rg ).\nIt is worth noting that the low-energy emission could be related to the narrow 6.4 keV (6 keV observed-frame) emission feature that was identified in the 2002 spectrum by G04. Since the\nfeature was not detected in the 2005 spectrum its origin could be\nconnected to the transient 5.5 \u2212 6.0 keV-line (perhaps the bluewing of this line), which is produced during the X-ray flare.\nThe combination of a hard X-ray flare, and redshifted and\nbroadened Fe K\u03b1 emission line has been seen in a very similar object, Nab 0205+024 (Gallo et al. 2004c). However, due to\nlimited data, time-resolved spectral modelling did not yield information about possible line variability. Re-examination of the\nNab 0205+024 data making use of excess residual imaging may\nbe fruitful.\n8.5 Physical models for I Zw 1\nThe level of absorption (neutral and ionised) appears to have\nchanged between the two epochs. However, even after considering this there does seem to be some subtle change in the intrinsic\ncontinuum shape.\nIt is of interest to compare the changes in the context of a\nphysical model such as reflection and light bending. In terms of the\nblurred reflection model, most of the intrinsic changes can be understood as arising from different relative contributions of the two\ncontinuum components. At both epochs (and historically), I Zw 1\nappears to be in a power law dominated state \u2013 the soft excess is\nnotably weak in this object.\nIf the power law component is a compact isotropic emitting source located above the black hole, as depicted in the lightbending scenario (e.g. Miniutti & Fabian 2004), then the changes\nin the continuum shape are largely motivated by the proximity of\nthis source to the black hole. In the higher flux 2002 observation,\nthe contribution from the reflection component was less, and hence\nthe soft excess was weaker. The AGN was brighter and in a power\nlaw dominated state. In 2005, I Zw 1 was dimmer and the reflection\ncomponent (i.e. the soft excess) was stronger.\nThis is almost certainly a simplified description of the true situation. One would expect other spectral changes to occur as the\npower law component varies its distance from the black hole. For\nexample, with increasing distance the photon index should harden\n(i.e. if due to Comptonisation), ionisation parameter may decrease\nas the accretion disc is less illuminated, and Rin will probably increase.\nAs the 0.3 \u2212 10 keV spectrum of I Zw 1 is dominated by one\ncomponent and subject to ionised absorption, it would not be surprising if other physical models provided adequate fits. Broad-band\nabsorption models, like the blurred absorption models (e.g. Gierlinski & Done 2004), have not been examined here, but could likely\nduplicate the spectrum of I Zw 1. It may be possible to break this\ndegeneracy by examining the spectral variability, which is complex\nin I Zw 1 and is somewhat unlike what is seen in other NLS1 (Gallo\net al. 2007).\n\n\fA longer XMM-Newton look at I Zw 1\n9 CONCLUSIONS\nIn this work, we presented an 85 ks XMM-Newton observation and\ndescribed the mean spectral and timing characteristics of the AGN,\nas well as compared the data to a previous, shorter XMM-Newton\nobservation from 2002. The complex ionised absorber is discussed\nin detail in the work of Costantini et al. (2007). The remarkable\nspectral variability is presented in Gallo et al. (2007). The main\nfindings from this work are the following:\n(1) I Zw 1 is \u223c 35 per cent dimmer in 2005 than it was in 2002.\nBetween the two epochs the level of neutral column density intrinsic to I Zw 1 changed, as well as the ionised absorber. In addition,\nsubtle changes in the continuum shape are apparent. If modelled\nwith the blurred reflection model, the long-term continuum changes\ncan be understood as arising from different relative contributions of\nthe two continuum components (i.e. direct power law and ionised\nreflection).\n(2) Variability is prevalent in all X-ray bands. The most distinct\nstructure in the mean light curve is a flux dip \u223c 25 ks into the observation. Average CCFs show a tendency for positive lags meaning soft band changes lead harder bands. However, examination of\nnormalised light curves indicate that the high-energy variations are\nquite structured and lags are only apparent in some parts of the light\ncurve. Interestingly, the hard X-ray lag first appears at the onset of\nthe flux dip in the light curve. This possible alternating lag has been\nproposed for another NLS1 (IRAS 13224\u20133809, Gallo et al. 2004b)\nand it is not consistent with Comptonisation from a single corona\nwith a uniform temperature and optical depth, and variable seed\nphotons.\n(3) The broad ionised Fe K\u03b1 line shows significant variations over\nthe course of the 2005 observation, which are not clearly due to\nintrinsic changes in the Fe K\u03b1-producing region. Other, viewerperspective effects, such as orbital motion or absorption in the\nbroad iron line-emitting region, could be invoked to describe the\nvariability.\n(4) The broad-line variability during 2002 is re-examined here.\nThere is evidence suggesting that a relativistically broadened\nFe K\u03b1 line is produced as a result of a hard X-ray flare illuminating\nthe inner regions (i.e. < 35 rg ) of the accretion disc.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe XMM-Newton project is an ESA Science Mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by ESA Member States\nand the USA (NASA).
