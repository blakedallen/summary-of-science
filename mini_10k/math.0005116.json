An Eulerian-Lagrangian description of the Euler equations has\nbeen used in ([1], [2]) for local existence results and constraints on blowup. Eulerian coordinates (fixed Euclidean coordinates) are natural for both\nanalysis and laboratory experiment. Lagrangian variables have a certain\ntheoretical appeal. In this work I present an approach to the Navier-Stokes\nequations that is phrased in unbiased Eulerian coordinates, yet describes\nobjects that have Lagrangian significance: particle paths, their dispersion\nand diffusion. The commutator between Lagrangian and Eulerian derivatives\nplays an important role in the Navier-Stokes equations: it contributes a\nsingular perturbation to the Euler equations, in addition to the Laplacian.\nThe Navier-Stokes equations are shown to be equivalent to the system\n\u0393v = 2\u03bdC\u2207v\nwhere C are the coefficients of the commutator between Eulerian and Lagrangian derivatives, and \u0393 is the operator of material derivative and viscous\ndiffusion. The physical pressure is not explicitly present in this formulation.\nThe Eulerian velocity u is related to v in a non-local fashion, and one may\nrecover the physical pressure dynamically from the evolution of the gradient\npart of v. When one sets \u03bd = 0 the commutator coefficients C do not enter\n1\n\n\fthe equation, and then v is a passive rearrangement of its initial value ([7],\n[8], [9], [10]). When \u03bd 6= 0 the perturbation involves the curvature of the\nparticle paths, and the gradients of v: a singular perturbation. Fortunately,\nthe coefficients C start from zero, and, as long as they remain small v does\nnot grow too much.\nA different but not unrelated approach ([11], ([12]) is based on a variable\nw that has the same curl as the Eulerian velocity u. The velocity is recovered then from w by projection on divergence-free functions. The evolution\nequation for w\n\u0393w + (\u2207u)\u2217 w = 0,\nconserves local helicity and circulation (when \u03bd = 0). We will refer to this\nequation informally as \"the cotangent equation\" because it is the equation\nobeyed by the Eulerian gradient of any scalar \u03c6 that solves \u0393\u03c6 = 0. The\nvariable w is related to v:\nw = (\u2207A)\u2217 v\nwhere A is the \"back-to-labels\" maps that corresponds when \u03bd = 0 to the\ninverse of the Lagrangian path map. A(x, t) is an active vector obeying\n\u0393A = 0,\nA(x, 0) = x. Both v and A have a Lagrangian meaning when \u03bd = 0, but the\ndynamical development of w is the product of two processes, the growth of\nthe deformation tensor (given by the evolution of \u2207A) and the rearrangement\nof a fixed function, given by the evolution of v. In the presence of viscosity,\nv's evolution is not by rearrangement only. It is therefore useful to study\nseparately the growth of \u2207A and the shift of v.\nRecently certain model equations (alpha-models) have been proposed\n([13], [14]) as modifications of the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. They\ncan be obtained in the context described above simply by smoothing u in the\ncotangent equation. Smoothing means that one replaces the linear zero-order\nnonlocal operator u = Pw that relates u to w in the cotangent equation by a\nsmoothing operator, u = K\u03b1 Pw. When \u03bd = 0 the models have a Kelvin circulation theorem. They cannot be models for Eulerian averaged equations,\nthe equations describing mean flow in turbulence theory. These Reynolds\nequations are not conservative in the limit of zero viscosity: the fluctuations\nintroduce additional stresses, the so-called Reynolds stresses, that preclude\n\n2\n\n\fconservation of circulation along the mean flow. This is a simple yet fundamental objection to the identification of alpha-models with Reynolds equations. The alpha-models might be models of Lagrangian averaged equations,\nan entirely different concept. (Operationally one may think of Eulerian averaging as long time averages at fixed position, and of Lagrangian averaging\nas long time averages at fixed initial label. However, a fixed initial label has\nno obvious physical meaning when one deals with ensembles of flows.)\nIn this paper we consider the Navier-Stokes equations and obtain rigorous\nbounds for the particle paths and for the virtual velocity v. The main bounds\nconcern the Lagrangian displacement, its first and second spatial derivatives,\nare obtained under general conditions and require no assumptions. Higher\nderivatives can be bounded also under certain natural quantitative smoothness assumptions.\nSome of our bounds can be interpreted as a connection to the Richardson\npair dispersion law, one of the empirical laws of fully developed turbulence\n([4]), that is consistent with the Kolmogorov two-thirds law ([5]). The pair\ndispersion law states that the separation \u03b4 between fluid particles obeys\n|\u03b4|2 \u223c \u01ebt3\nwhere \u01eb is the rate of dissipation of energy and t is time. This is supposed\nto hold in an inertial range, for times t that are neither too small (when the\nseparation is ballistic) nor too large, when viscous and boundary effects are\nimportant. The law can be guessed by dimensional analysis by requiring the\nanswer to depend solely on time and \u01eb. Precise laboratory Lagrangian experiments have recently begun to be capable of addressing Lagrangian quantities\nwith preliminary results that seem to be consistent with the Richardson law\nin some ranges ([6]). If one considers the problem of estimating the pair\ndispersion mathematically one is faced with the difficulty that the prediction seems to require both non-Lipschitz, H\u00f6lder continuous velocities and\nLagrangian particle paths. Our approach allows a rigorous formulation and\nan upper bound\n|\u03b4|2 \u2264 3|\u03b40 |2 + 24E0 t2 + 6\u01ebB t3 ,\nthat includes a reference to an initial displacement \u03b40 , an initial kinetic energy\nE0 and a rigorous upper bound on \u01eb. The prefactors are probably not optimal.\nThe conditions under which such a bound can be obtained are quite general,\nand there are no assumptions. In this paper we chose the case of periodic\nboundary conditions, and body forces that have a characteristic length scale\n3\n\n\fthat remains finite as the size of the periodic box is allowed to diverge. The\nbound \u01ebB does not depend on the size of box. In many physically realistic\nsituations one injects energy at the boundary; in that case one can find \u01ebB\nindependently of viscosity ([3]), without any assumptions.\n\n2\n\nVelocity and displacement\n\nThe Eulerian velocity u(x, t) has three components ui , i = 1, 2 , 3 and is a\nfunction of three Eulerian space coordinates x and time t. We decompose\nthe Eulerian velocity u(x, t):\n\u2202Am (x, t)\n\u2202n(x, t)\nu (x, t) =\nvm (x, t) \u2212\n.\n\u2202xi\n\u2202xi\ni\n\n(1)\n\nRepeated indices are summed. There are three objects that appear in this\nformula. The first one, A(x, t), has a Lagrangian interpretation. In the\nabsence of viscosity, A is the \"back-to-labels\" map, the inverse of the particle\ntrajectory map a 7\u2192 x = X(a, t). The vector\nl(x, t) = A(x, t) \u2212 x\n\n(2)\n\nwill be called the \"Eulerian-Lagrangian displacement vector\", or simply \"displacement\". l joins the current Eulerian position x to the original Lagrangian\nposition a = A(x, t). A(x, t) and l(x, t) have dimensions of length, \u2207A is\nnon-dimensional. A pair of points, a = A(x, t), b = A(y, t) situated at time\nt = 0 at distance \u03b40 = |a \u2212 b| become separated by \u03b4t = |x \u2212 y| at time t.\nFrom the triangle inequality it follows that\n(\u03b4t )2 \u2264 3|l(x, t)|2 + 3|l(y, t)|2 + 3(\u03b40 )2 .\n\n(3)\n\nThe displacement can be used in this manner to bound pair dispersion.\nThe second object in (1), v(x, t), has dimensions of velocity and, in the\nabsence of viscosity, is just the initial velocity composed with the back-tolabels map ([7], [8], [9], [10]). We call v the \"virtual velocity\". Its evolution\nmarks the difference between the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations most\nclearly. The third object in (1) is a scalar function n(x, t) that will be referred\nto as \"the Eulerian-Lagrangian potential\". It plays a mathematical role akin\nto that played by the physical pressure but has dimensions of length squared\nper time, like the kinematic viscosity. If A(x, t) is known, then there are\n4\n\n\ffour functions entering the decomposition of u, three v-s and one n. If the\nvelocity is divergence-free\n\u2207 * u = 0,\nthen there is one relationship between the four unknown functions.\n\n3\n\nEulerian-Lagrangian derivatives and commutators\n\nWhen one considers the map x 7\u2192 A(x, t) as a change of variables one can\npull back the Lagrangian differentiation with respect to particle position and\nwrite it in Eulerian coordinates using the chain rule. Let us call this pull-back\nof Lagrangian derivatives the Eulerian-Lagrangian derivative,\n\u2207A = Q\u2217 \u2207E .\n\n(4)\n\nQ(x, t) = (\u2207A(x, t))\u22121 ,\n\n(5)\n\nHere\n\nand the notation Q\u2217 refers to the transpose of the matrix Q. The expression\nof \u2207A on components is\n\u2207iA = Qji \u2202j\n\n(6)\n\nwhere we wrote \u2202i for differentiation in the i-th Eulerian Cartesian coordinate\ndirection,\n\u2202i = \u2207iE .\nThe Eulerian spatial derivatives can be expressed in terms of the EulerianLagrangian derivatives via\n\u2207iE = (\u2202i Am ) \u2207m\nA\n\n(7)\n\nThe commutation relations\n[\u2207iE , \u2207kE ] = 0,\n\n\u0002 i\n\u0003\n\u2207A , \u2207kA = 0\n\nhold. The commutators between Eulerian-Lagrangian and Eulerian derivatives do not vanish, in general:\n\u0002 i\n\u0003\n\u2207A , \u2207kE = Cm,k;i \u2207m\n(8)\nA.\n5\n\n\fThe coefficients Cm,k;i are given by\nCm,k;i = {\u2207iA (\u2202k lm )}.\n\n(9)\n\nNote that\nCm,k;i = Qji \u2202i \u2202k Am = \u2207iA (\u2207kE Am ) = [\u2207iA , \u2207kE ]Am .\nThese commutator coefficients play an important role in dynamics.\n\n4\n\nThe evolution of A\n\nWe associate to a given divergence-free velocity u(x, t) the operator\n\u2202t + u * \u2207 \u2212 \u03bd\u2206 = \u0393\u03bd (u, \u2207).\n\n(10)\n\nWe write \u2202t for time derivative. We write \u0393 for \u0393\u03bd (u, \u2207) when the u we use is\nclear from the context. The coefficient \u03bd > 0 is the kinematic viscosity of the\nfluid. When applied to a vector or a matrix, \u0393 acts as a diagonal operator, i.e.\non each component separately. The operator \u0393 obeys a maximum principle:\nIf a function q solves\n\u0393q = S\nand the function q has homogeneous Dirichlet or periodic boundary conditions, then the sup-norm kqkL\u221e (dx) satisfies\nkq(*, t)kL\u221e (dx) \u2264 kq(*, t0)kL\u221e (dx) +\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nkS(*, s)kL\u221e (dx) ds\nt0\n\nfor any t0 \u2264 t. The operator \u0393\u03bd (u, \u2207) is not a derivation (that means an\noperator that satisfies the product rule); \u0393 satisfies a product rule that is\nsimilar to that of a derivation:\n\u0393(f g) = (\u0393f )g + f (\u0393g) \u2212 2\u03bd(\u2202k f )(\u2202k g).\n\n(11)\n\nWe require the back-to-labels map A to obey\n\u0393A = 0.\n\n6\n\n(12)\n\n\fBy (12) we express therefore the advection and diffusion of A. We will use\nsometimes the equation obeyed by l\n(\u2202t + u * \u2207 \u2212 \u03bd\u2206) l + u = 0\n\n(13)\n\nwhich is obviously equivalent to (12). We will discuss periodic boundary\nconditions\nl(x + Lej , t) = l(x, t),\nwhere ej is the unit vector in the j-th direction. Some of our inequalities will\nhold also for the physical boundary condition that require l(x, t) = 0 at the\nboundary.\nIt is important to note that the initial data for the displacement is zero:\nl(x, 0) = 0.\n\n(14)\n\nThe matrix \u2207A(x, t) is invertible as long as the evolution is smooth. This\nis obvious when \u03bd = 0 because the determinant of this matrix equals 1 for\nall time, but in the viscous case the statement needs proof. We differentiate\n(12) in order to obtain the equation obeyed by \u2207A\n\u0393(\u2207A) + (\u2207A)(\u2207u) = 0.\n\n(15)\n\nThe product (\u2207A)(\u2207u) is matrix product in the order indicated. We consider\n\u0393Q = (\u2207u)Q + 2\u03bdQ\u2202k (\u2207A)\u2202k Q.\n\n(16)\n\nIt is clear that the solutions of both (15) and (16) are smooth as long as the\nadvecting velocity u is sufficiently smooth. It is easy to verify using (11) that\nthe matrix Z = (\u2207A)Q \u2212 I obeys the equation\n\u0393Z = 2\u03bdZ\u2202k (\u2207A)\u2202k Q\nwith initial datum Z(x, 0) = 0. Thus, as long as u is smooth, Z(x, t) = 0\nand it follows that the solution Q of (16) is the inverse of \u2207A.\nThe commutator coefficients Cm,k;i enter the important commutation relation between the Eulerian-Lagrangian label derivative and \u0393:\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0393, \u2207iA = 2\u03bdCm,k;i \u2207kE \u2207m\n(17)\nA\n7\n\n\fThe proof of this formula can be found in Appendix B.\nThe evolution of the coefficients Cm,k;i defined in (9) can be computed\nusing (15) and (17):\n\u0393 (Cm,k;i ) = \u2212(\u2202l Am )\u2207iA (\u2202k (ul ))\n\u2212(\u2202k (ul ))Cm,l;i + 2\u03bdCj,l;i * \u2202l (Cm,k;j ) .\n\n(18)\n\nThe calculation leading to (18) is presented in Appendix B.\n\n5\n\nThe evolution of v\n\nWe require the virtual velocity to obey\n\u0393v = 2\u03bdC\u2207v + Q\u2217 f.\n\n(19)\n\nThis equation is, on components\n\u0393\u03bd (u, \u2207)vi = 2\u03bdCm,k;i \u2202k vm + Qji fj .\n\n(20)\n\nThe vector f = f (x, t) represents the body forces. The boundary conditions\nare periodic\nv(x + Lej , t) = v(x, t)\nand the initial data are, for instance\nv(x, 0) = u0 (x).\n\n(21)\n\nThe reason for requiring the equation (19) is\nProposition 1. Assume that u is given by the expression (1) above and\nthat the displacement l and the virtual velocity v obey the equations (13) and\nrespectively (19). Then the velocity u satisfies the Navier-Stokes equation\n\u2202t u + u * \u2207u \u2212 \u03bd\u2206u + \u2207p = f\nwith pressure p determined from the Eulerian-Lagrangian potential by\n\u0393\u03bd (u, \u2207)n +\nwhere c is a free constant.\n8\n\n|u|2\n+c=p\n2\n\n\fProof. We denote for convenience\nDt = \u2202t + u * \u2207.\n\n(22)\n\nWe apply Dt to the velocity representation (1) and use the commutation\nrelation\n[Dt , \u2202k ] g = \u2212(\u2207u)\u2217 \u2207g.\n\n(23)\n\nWe obtain\ni\n\nm\n\nm\n\nDt (u ) = (\u2202i (Dt A )) vm + (\u2202i A )Dt vm \u2212 \u2202i\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n|u|2\n+ Dt n .\n2\n\nWe substitute the equations for A (13) and for v (19):\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\n|u|\ni\n+ Dt n + (\u2202i (\u03bd\u2206Am )) vm +\nDt (u ) = \u2212\u2202i\n2\n\b\n\u0001\n(\u2202i Am ) \u03bd\u2206vm + Q\u2217mj 2\u03bd\u2202k (\u2207l)\u2217jl \u2202k vl + fj .\nNow we use the facts that\n\n(\u2202i Am )Q\u2217mj = \u03b4ij\n(Kronecker's delta), and\n\u2202k (\u2207l)\u2217il = \u2202k (\u2207A)\u2217il = \u2202k (\u2202i Al )\nto deduce\ni\n\nDt (u ) = \u2212\u2202i\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n|u|2\n+ Dt n + fi\n2\n\n+\u03bd(\u2206\u2202i Am )vm + \u03bd(\u2202i Am )\u2206vm + 2\u03bd\u2202k (\u2202i Al )\u2202k vl\nand so, changing the dummy summation index l to m in the last expression\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\n|u|\ni\nDt (u ) = \u2212\u2202i\n+ Dt n + \u03bd\u2206((\u2202i Am )vm ) + fi .\n2\nUsing (1) we obtained\ni\n\nDt (u ) = \u03bd\u2206ui \u2212 \u2202i\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n|u|2\n\u2212 \u03bd\u2206n + Dt n + fi\n2\n9\n\n\fand that concludes the proof.\nObservation The incompressibility of velocity has not yet been used. This is\nwhy no restriction on the potential n(x, t) was needed. The incompressibility\n\u2207*u =0\n\n(24)\n\ncan be imposed in two ways. The first approach is static: one considers the\nansatz (1) and one requires that n maintains the incompressibility at each\ninstance of time. This results in the equation\n\u2206n = \u2207 * (\u2207A)\u2217 v) .\n\n(25)\n\nIn this way n is computed from A in a time independent manner and the\nbasic formula (1) can be understood as\nu = P ((\u2207A)\u2217 v)\n\n(26)\n\nwhere P is the Leray-Hodge projector on divergence-free functions. The second approach is dynamic: one computes the physical Navier-Stokes pressure\np = Ri Rj (ui uj ) + c\n\n(27)\n\n1\n\nwhere c is a free constant and Ri = (\u2212\u2206)\u2212 2 \u2202i is the Riesz transform for\nperiodic boundary conditions. The formula for p follows by taking the divergence of the Navier-Stokes equation and using (24). Substituting (27) in\nthe expression for the pressure in Proposition 1 one obtains the evolution\nequation\n|u|2\n\u0393n = Ri Rj (u u ) \u2212\n+c\n(28)\n2\nfor n. Incompressibility can be enforced either by solving at each time the\nstatic equation (25) or by evolving n according to (28).\ni j\n\nProposition 2. Let u be given by (1) and assume that the displacement\nsolves (13) and that the virtual velocity solves (19). Assume in addition that\nthe potential obeys (25) (respectively (28)). Then u obeys the incompressible\nNavier-Stokes equations,\n\u2202t u + u * \u2207u \u2212 \u03bd\u2206u + \u2207p = f,\n\n\u2207 * u = 0,\n\nthe pressure p satisfies (27) and the potential obeys also (28) (respectively\n(25)).\n10\n\n\fThe same results hold for the case of the whole R3 with boundary conditions requiring u and l to vanish at infinity. In the presence of boundaries,\nif the boundary conditions for u are homogeneous Dirichlet (u = 0) then the\nboundary conditions for v are Dirichlet, but not homogeneous. In that case\none needs to solve either one of the equations (25),(28) for n (with Dirichlet\nor other physical boundary condition) and the v equation (19) with\nv = \u2207A n\nat the boundary.\nProposition 3. Let u be an arbitrary spatially periodic smooth function and\nassume that a displacement l solves the equation (13) and a virtual velocity\nv obeys the equation (19) with periodic boundary conditions and with C computed using A = x + l. Then w defined by\nwi = (\u2202i Am )vm\n\n(29)\n\n\u0393w + (\u2207u)\u2217w = f.\n\n(30)\n\nobeys the cotangent equation\n\nProof. The proof is a straightforward calculation. One uses (11) to write\n\u0393wi = (\u2202i Am )\u0393vm + vm \u0393(\u2202i Am ) \u2212 2\u03bd(\u2202k \u2202i Am )\u2202k vm .\nThe equation (20) is used for the first term and the equation (15) for the\nsecond term. One obtains\n\u0393wi = fi \u2212 (\u2202i uj )wj + 2\u03bd {(\u2202i Am )Cr,q;m\u2202q vr \u2212 (\u2202k \u2202i Am )\u2202k vm } .\nThe proof ends by showing that the term in braces vanishes because of the\nidentity\n(\u2202i Am )Cr,q;m = \u2202q \u2202i Ar .\nAn approach to the Euler equations based entirely on a variable w ([11],\n([12]) is well-known. The function w has the same curl as u, \u03c9 = \u2207 \u00d7 u =\n\u2207 \u00d7 w. In the case of zero viscosity and no forcing, the local helicity w * \u03c9 is\nconserved Dt (w *\u03c9) = 0; this is easily checked using the fact that the vorticity\n11\n\n\fobeys the \"tangent\" equation Dt \u03c9 = (\u2207u)\u03c9 and the inviscid, unforced form\nof (30). The same proof verifies the Kelvin circulation theorem\nI\nd\nw * dX = 0\ndt \u03b3(t)\non loops \u03b3(t) advected by the flow of u. Although obviously related, the two\nvariables v and w have very different analytical merits. While the growth of\nw is difficult to control, in the inviscid case v does not grow at all, and in\nthe viscous case its growth is determined by the magnitude of C which starts\nfrom zero. This is why we emphasize v as the primary variable and consider\nw a derived variable.\n\n6\n\nGauge Invariance\n\nConsider a scalar function \u03c6. If one transforms v 7\u2192 \u1e7d = v + \u2207A \u03c6 and\nn 7\u2192 \u00f1 = n + \u03c6 then u remains unchanged in (1): u 7\u2192 u. The requirement\nthat \u2207E * u = 0 does not specify this arbitrary \u03c6.\nAssume now that the scalar \u03c6 is advected passively by u and diffuses with\ndiffusivity \u03bd:\n\u0393\u03c6 = 0.\nThen, in view of (17), if v solves (19) then\n\u1e7d = v + \u2207A \u03c6\nalso solves (19). If n solves (28) then\n\u00f1 = n + \u03c6\nalso solves (28). If w solves the equation (30) then\nw\u0303 = w + \u2207E \u03c6\nalso solves (30). The vector fields obtained by taking the Eulerian gradient of\npassive scalars are homogeneous solutions of (30). The vector fields obtained\nby taking the Eulerian-Lagrangian gradient of passive scalars, \u2207A \u03c6 are homogeneous solutions of (19). This can be used to show that if one chooses\nan initial datum for v that differs from u0 by the gradient of an arbitrary\nfunction \u03c60 there is no change in the evolution of u.\n12\n\n\fProposition 4. Let each of two functions vj , j = 1, 2 solve the system\n\u0393(uj , \u2207)vj = 2\u03bdCj \u2207vj + Q\u2217j f\nwith periodic boundary conditions, coupled with\n\u0393(uj , \u2207)Aj = 0\nwith periodic boundary conditions for lj = Aj \u2212 x. Assume that the initial data for Aj are the same, lj (x, 0) = 0. Assume that each velocity is\ndetermined from its corresponding virtual velocity by the rule\nuj = P ((\u2207Aj )\u2217 vj ) .\nAssume, moreover, that at time t = 0 the virtual velocities differ by a\ngradient\nPv1 = Pv2 = u0 .\nThen, as long as one of the solutions vj is smooth one has\nu1 (x, t) = u2 (x, t),\n\nA1 (x, t) = A2 (x, t)\n\nThe same kind of result can be proved for (30) using the Eulerian gauge\ninvariance.\n\n7\n\nK-bounds\n\nWe are going to describe here bounds that are based solely on the kinetic\nenergy balance in the Navier-Stokes equation ( ([15]) and references therein).\nThese are very important, as they are the only unconditional bounds that\nare known for arbitrary time intervals. We call them kinetic energy bounds\nor in short, K-bounds. We start with the most important, the energy balance\nitself.

The prefactors\nare not optimal. The energy balance holds for all solutions of the NavierStokes equations. We took an arbitrary starting time t0 . The bound K0 is a\nnondecreasing function of t \u2212 t0 . We will use this fact tacitly below.
