We obtain asymptotic\nfor the minimal number of vertices of the graph with the given number n of maximal\nindependent sets for a class of natural numbers that can be represented as concatenation\nof periodic binary words.\n\nProblems of estimating various graph invariants play the central role in quantitative graph\ntheory. Among the most studied invariants are connectivity, chromatic number, girth, independence number, maximal clique size, number of independent sets etc. As well as forward\nproblems, inverse problems also are of interest. They generally can be stated as follows: find\na graph (or prove its existence) that have the desired value of some parameter. The classical\nproblem of this kind is finding a graph with the given degree sequence [2, 3]. For a long time\nit was not known if there was only a finite number of naturals not being the Wiener index of\ntrees. [5, 6]. An analogous question considering the number of independent sets in trees, asked\nin [4], is not yet solved, whereas some other parameters of trees are better studied (e.g. [1]).\nWe now state the problems coevered in this paper in their general form. Let G be a family\nof graphs, and let \u03c6 : G \u2192 S and \u03c8 : G \u2192 T be arbitrary functionals on G. The existential\ninverse problem for the pair (G, \u03c6) may be stated as follows: \"describe all s \u2208 S for which there\nexists a graph G \u2208 G having \u03c6(G) = s\".\nLet S be the set of all values of \u03c8 for all graphs in G. For S \u2286 N we call G to be strongly\n\u03c6-complete, if for every s \u2208 S there is G \u2208 G such that \u03c6(G) = s. If such G \u2208 G exists for all\nlarge enough s \u2208 S, then we say that G is weakly \u03c6-complete, or just \u03c6-complete. If \u03c6(G) = s\nthen we say that s is realized by G.\nIf the existential inverse problem is solved positively, we can consider the optimizational\ninverse problem for the triple (G, \u03c6, \u03c8): \"for a given s \u2208 S find LG\u03c6, \u03c8 (s) = inf{\u03c8(G) | G \u2208\nG, \u03c6(G) = s}\". As the problem of finding L exactly is too hard, it is natural to consider only\nthe asymptotic behavior of LG\u03c6, \u03c8 (s) for \u03c6-complete families of graphs. If G is a class of all\ngraphs, we shorten the notation LG\u03c6, \u03c8 (s) to L\u03c6, \u03c8 (s).\nDenote by \u03b9(G) the number of all independent sets (i. s.) of vertices in G, and by \u03b9m (G) the\nnumber of maximal-by-inclusion i.s. (m. i. s.) in G. Finally, by \u03b9M (G) we denote the number\nof maximum independent sets in G. We write \u03bd(G) and \u01eb(G) for the number of vertices and\nedges in G respectively. The families of bipartite graphs and forests are denoted by B and F\nrespectively. We write Kr and Pr for complete graphs and paths on r vertices. Kr,s denotes\n\u2032\ncomplete bipartite graph, r and s being the sizes of its parts. Kr,r\nstands for the corona-graph,\nwhich can be constructed by deleting edges of some perfect matching from Kr,r . The sets of\n1\n\n\fvertices and edges of graph G will be denoted as VG and EG . The edge between vertices u and\nv will be denoted as uv. A family of all m. i. s. of G is denoted as Im (G).\nIn the notation of the current paper, Linek proved [4] the strong \u03b9-completeness of B.\nIt justifies the consideration of the optimization problem of finding LB\u03b9, \u03bd (n). The trivial lower\nbound is LB\u03b9, \u03bd (n) > log2 n (which follows from the inequation \u03b9(G) \u2264 2\u03bd(G) ). A graph constructed\nin [4] to realize a given natural number has the maximal possible sizes of parts: \u230alog2 n\u230b and\n\u230alog2 (n \u2212 2\u230alog2 n\u230b + 1)\u230b. For n = 2k \u2212 1 such graph would have 2k \u2212 2 vertices, which is double\nthe expected optimal size. Some n of the above form can be realized more economically, as the\nfollowing statement shows.\nk\nTheorem 1. For k = 2t we have LF\n\u03b9, \u03bd (2 \u2212 1) . k.\n\nProof. Just note that\nt\u22121\nt\u22121\nY\nY\nj\nt\n22 \u2212 1 =\n(22 + 1) =\n\u03b9(K2j ,1 ) = \u03b9\nj=0\n\nAt the same time \u03bd(\n\nFt\u22121\n\nj=0\n\nj=0\n\nt\u22121\nG\n\nj=0\n\nK2j ,1\n\n!\n\n.\n\nK2j ,1 ) = 2t + t \u2212 1 . k.\n\nThe existential inverse problem for (B, \u03b9m ) is trivial, as any n \u2265 4 can be realized as the\n\u2032\nnumber of m. i. s. in corona-graph Kn\u22122,n\u22122\n. If we consider \u03c8 to be the number of vertices\nof a graph, we come up with an optimizational inverse problem: \"for natural n find minimal\nL(n) such that there exists a graph on L(n) vertices having n maximal independent sets\". The\nremaining part of the paper is dedicated to estimating L(n).\n\nBounds for LB\u03b9m,\u03bd (n)\ne be a\nLemma 1. Let G be bipartite with parts LG , RG and without isolated vertices. Let G\nbipartite graph, vertex-disjoint with G, and let U1 and U2 be some subsets of first and second\ne respectively. Let G\u2032 be a graph obtained by connecting all vertices in U1 (resp. U2 )\nparts of G\nto all vertices in LG (resp. RG ). Then we have\ne \\ (U1 \u222a U2 )) + \u03b9m (G\ne \\ U1 ) + \u03b9m (G\ne \\ U2 ) + \u03b9m (G\ne + U1 + U2 ),\n\u03b9m (G\u2032 ) = (\u03b9m (G) \u2212 2) * \u03b9m (G\n\ne + U1 + U2 ) stands for the number of m. i. s. of G\ne having non-empty intersections\nwhere \u03b9m (G\nwith both U1 and U2 .\n\nProof. The statement of the lemma can be checked by direct counting. If an m. i. s. of G\u2032\ncontains no vetices of G, then it must contain at least one vertex from both U1 and U2 , the\ne + U1 + U2 ). If a m. i. s. of G\u2032 contains vertices from both\nnumber of such sets being \u03b9m (G\ne must themselves be\nparts of G, then it is disjoint with U1 \u222a U2 , and its subsets in G and G\ne respectively. Thus the number of such m. i. s. equals\nmaximal independent sets in G and G\ne\n(\u03b9m (G) \u2212 2) * \u03b9m (G \\ (U1 \u222a U2 )). If a m. i. s. of G contains all vertices of LG or whole RG , then\ne will form a m. i. s. in G\ne \\ U1 or G\ne \\ U2 respectively.\nits subset in G\ne be bipartite with U1 and U2 being some subsets of its parts. Put\nLet G\ne \\ (U1 \u222a U2 )),\nh\u2032Ge = \u03b9m (G\n\ne \\ U1 ) + \u03b9m (G\ne \\ U2 ) + \u03b9m (G\ne + U1 + U2 ) \u2212 2\u03b9m (G\ne \\ (U1 \u222a U2 ))).\nh\u2032\u2032Ge = (\u03b9m (G\n2\n\n\fLemma 2. Let \u0393 be a finite set of bipartite graphs with selected subsets in their parts, such\ne \u2208 \u0393} \u2287 (N \\ [1, n0 ]) for some n0 . Put\nthat {h\u2032Ge k + h\u2032\u2032Ge | k \u2208 N, G\nn\no\ne |G\ne\u2208\u0393 .\n\u03b3 = max (log2 h\u2032Ge )\u22121 \u03bd(G)\n\nThen LB\u03b9m , \u03bd (n) \u2264 \u03b3 * log2 n + O(1).\n\nProof. The lemma is proved by induction on n with a help of lemma 1. Let \u03930 be an arbitrary\nfinite set of bipartite graphs having {\u03b9m (G) | G \u2208 \u03930 } \u2287 [1, n0 ]. For example, as \u03930 we can take\n\u2032\nthe set {Kn\u22122,n\u22122\n| n \u2208 [4, n0 ]} \u222a {K1 , K1,1 , P4 }. Let \u03bd0 be the maximal number of vertices of\ngraphs in \u03930 . It suffices to prove that for any n the following inequality holds:\nLB\u03b9m , \u03bd (n) \u2264 \u03b3 * log2 n + \u03bd0 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhich would imply the statement of the lemma.\nThe inequality (1) trivially holds for n \u2264 n0 . Consider an arbitrary n\u2032 , n\u2032 > n0 , and assume\ne\u2208\u0393\nthat (1) holds for all n less than n\u2032 . By the conditions of the lemma, there exists some G\nand some natural k, such that n\u2032 = h\u2032Ge k + h\u2032\u2032Ge . By the induction hypothesis there is some\nbipartite G having \u03b9m (G) = k and \u03bd(G) \u2264 \u03b3 * log2 k + \u03bd0 . By lemma 1 we conclude that there\nis a graph G\u2032 with \u03b9m (G\u2032 ) = n\u2032 and\n\nBy (2) and k \u2264\n\nn\u2032\nh\u2032e\n\nG\n\ne \u2264 \u03bd(G)\ne + \u03b3 * log2 k + \u03bd0 .\n\u03bd(G\u2032 ) \u2264 \u03bd(G) + \u03bd(G)\n\n(2)\n\nwe have\n\ne + \u03b3 * log2 n\u2032 \u2212 \u03b3 * log2 h\u2032 + \u03bd0 =\n\u03bd(G\u2032 ) \u2264 \u03bd(G)\ne\nG\ne \u2212 \u03b3) * log2 h\u2032 \u2264\n= \u03b3 * log2 n\u2032 + \u03bd0 + ((log2 h\u2032Ge )\u22121 \u03bd(G)\ne\nG\n\u2264 \u03b3 * log2 n\u2032 + \u03bd0 .\nTheorem 2. For all n \u2208 N we have\n2 log2 n \u2264 LB\u03b9m ,\u03bd (n) \u2264 2.88 log2 n + O(1).\n\n(3)\n\nProof. The lower bound of (3) follows from the observation that a number of m. i. s. in a\nbipartite graphs cannot exceed the number of subsets of any of this graph's parts.\nTo obtain the upper bound we apply lemma 2 with \u0393 being equal to the following set of\ngraphs (subsets U1 , U2 are marked as bold vertices; pairs of numbers (h\u2032Ge , h\u2032\u2032Ge ) are scribed under\nthe graphs):\n\n3\n\n\f\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\n~\u25e6\n~~\n~\n~\n~~\n~\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n(2, 0)\n\u2022\n\u25e6\n~~\n~~\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n~~\n~~\n~~\n~~\n~\n~\n~\n~~\n~~\n~~\n\u25e6~\n\u25e6~\n\u25e6~\n\n(3, 0)\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n~~\n\n\u2022@\n\u25e6\no\u25e6\n~~ @@@\n~~ ooo\n~\n@@\n~\n~~\n~~ oooo\n~\n~\n~\n@@ ~~\n~~\n~o~ooo\n\u25e6~\n\u25e6\n\u25e6~\n\u25e6~o\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\n(6, 1)\n\u25e6\n\u2022@\n\u25e6@\n\u25e6@\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n~~\n~~ @@@ ~~~ @@@ ~~~ @@@\n~\n~\n@@\n@@\n@@\n~\n~\n~\n~\n~\n~\n~\n~\n@@\n~~\n~~\n~~ @@ ~~~ @@\n\u25e6~\n\u25e6~\n\u25e6~\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n(18, 7)\n\u2022\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n~~\n~~\n~~\n~~\n~~\n\n(18, 5)\n\u25e6\n\u25e6@@@ \u2022@@@ \u25e6@@@ ~~\u25e6@O@O@OO \u25e6\n@@\n@@\n@~\n@@OOOO\n@@\n@@ ~~~@@@\n@@ OOO\nOO\n@\n@ ~~ @\n@\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n(18, 11)\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u2022\n\u25e6\n\u25e6@OO \u25e6\n~~\n~~\n~~\n~~ @@OO ~~\n@@~~OOOO ~~\n~\n~\n~\n~ @@ O~O~O\n~~\n~~\n~~\n~\n~\n~\n~\n@\nO\n~\n~\n~\n~\n~\nO ~\n\u25e6~\n\u25e6~\n\u25e6~\n\u25e6~\n\u2022\n\n~~\n~~\n~~\n~~\n~~\n~~\n~~\n~~\n~~\n~~\n~\n~\n~\n~\n~\n\u25e6~\n\u25e6~\n\u25e6~\n\u2022~\n\u25e6~\n\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n(18, 13)\n(18, 17)\nIt can be checked, that such \u0393 meets the conditions of lemma 2 and for this set the parameter\n\u03b3 would equal 12(log2 18)\u22121 < 2.88.

These can be of the following seven types:\n1. Let I1 = {I \u2208 Im (G\u2032 ) | I \u2229 LG 6= \u2205, I \u2229 RG 6= \u2205}. Note that for every set I \u2208 I1 the\nsubset I \u2229 VG is m. i. s. in G, and that the intersection of VG\u2032 \\ VG and I can only contain\nthe following vertices: u\nei , e\nvi , ui,j and vi,j for j 6= t + 1. The subgraph generated by these\nvertices is a matching, which implies\n|I1 | = (\u03b9m (G) \u2212 2) * 2st .\n\n(4)\n\n2. Let I2 = {I \u2208 Im (G\u2032 ) | I \u2229 LG 6= \u2205, I \u2229 RG = \u2205}. It can be checked that every I \u2208 I2\nmust contain all vertices from LG , and also vertices w and ui,t+1 for all i. Moreover I\nis disjoint with RGe . The rest of the vertices in I form a maximal independent set in\nsubgraph, generated by the set\nLGe \u222a {e\nui | i \u2264 t} \u222a {e\nvi | i \u2264 t} \u222a {ui,j | i \u2264 s \u2212 1, j \u2264 t} \u222a {vi,j | i \u2264 s \u2212 1, j \u2264 t + 1}.\nThe number of the latter is 2st , so we have\n|I2 | = 2st .\n\n(5)\n\n3. Let I3 = {I \u2208 Im (G\u2032 ) | I \u2229 LG = \u2205, I \u2229 RG 6= \u2205}. As in the previous case we have\n|I3 | = 2st . With (4) and (5) it gives us\n|I1 | + |I2 | + |I3 | = \u03b9m (G) * 2st .\n5\n\n(6)\n\n\f4. We now turn to counting those m. i. s. of G\u2032 that contain no vertices of VG . We use the\nnotation IG = {I \u2208 Im (G\u2032 ) | I \u2229 VG = \u2205}.\nLet \u011c be a subgraph of G generated by vertices ui,j and vi,j , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 s \u2212 1, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 t + 1.\nFor what follows it is useful to calculate \u03b9m (\u011c). The number \u03b9\u03020 of m. i. s. of \u011c which do\nnot contain any vi,t+1 equals to 2(s\u22121)t (that is the number of m. i. s. in a matching with\n(s \u2212 1)t edges). Next consider an arbitrary k, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 s \u2212 1. Let us count the number\n\u03b9\u0302k of those maximal independent sets I\u02c6 in \u011c, that contain vk,t+1 but do not contain any\nof vi,t+1 for i > k. For such I\u02c6 we have I\u02c6 6\u220b ui,j and I\u02c6 \u220b vi,j for all i < k and for all j.\nMoreover, for such I\u02c6 we have I\u02c6 \u220b ui,t+1 for i > k, and the rest of vertices in I\u02c6 form a\nmaximal independent set in a matching {ui,j vi,j | k < i \u2264 s \u2212 1, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 t}. From what\nwas mentioned it follows that \u03b9\u0302k = 2(s\u22121\u2212k)t .
