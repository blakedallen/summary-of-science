This paper tries to answer the question whether one can\nunderstand some of these Hopf algebras in terms of a single mathematical\nconstruction.\nWe recall the Hopf algebra of rooted trees as defined by Connes and Kreimer\nin [3]. Apart from its physical relevance, it has a universal property in\nHochschild cohomology. We generalize the operadic construction by Moerdijk [13] of this Hopf algebra to more general trees (with colored edges),\nand prove a universal property in coalgebra Hochschild cohomology. For a\nHopf operad P, the construction is based on the operad P[\u03bbn ] obtained from\nP by adjoining a free n-ary operation.\nFor a specific multi-parameter family of Hopf algebras obtained in this way,\nwe give explicit formulas for the (a priori inductively defined) comultiplication and for the Lie bracket underlying the dual . Some special cases yield\nnatural examples of pre-Lie and dendriform (and thus associative) algebras.\nWe apply these results to construct some known Hopf algebras of trees. Notably, the Loday-Ronco Hopf algebra of planar binary trees [11], and the\nBrouder-Frabetti pruning Hopf algebra [1].\nThe author plans to discuss the simplicial algebra structure on the set of\ninitial algebras with free n-ary operation Pn for an operad P with multiplication in future work, together with some relations of the P[\u03bbn ] to the\nalgebra Hochschild complex.\nThe author is grateful to Ieke Moerdijk for suggesting the Hopf P-algebras\nPn and their simplicial structure and for motivating as well as illuminating\ndiscussions, and to Lo\u0131\u0308c Foissy and Maria Ronco for pointing out errors in\nprevious versions of this manuscript.\n1\n\n\fSome Hopf algebras of trees\n\n2\n\n2\n\nPreliminaries\n\nThis section fixes notation on trees and describes some results of Connes\nand Kreimer[3], and Chapoton and Livernet [2] that motivated this paper.\nRooted trees t are isomorphism classes of finite partially ordered sets which\n(i). have a minimal element r (\u2200x 6= r : r < x); we call r the root, and\n(ii). satisfy the tree condition that (y 6= z) \u2227 (y < x) \u2227 (z < x) implies\n(y < z) \u2228 (z < y).\nThe elements of a tree are called vertices. A pair of vertices v < w is called\nan edge if there is no vertex x such that v < x < w. The number of vertices\nof a tree t is denoted by |t|. A path from x to y in a tree is a sequence (xi )i\nof elements x = xn > xn\u22121 > . . . > x1 > x0 = y of maximal length. We will\nsay that x is above y in a tree if there is a path from x to y. Thus we may\ndepict a rooted tree as a finite directed graph, with one terminal vertex, the\nroot. A vertex is called a leaf if there is no other vertex above it. A vertex\nis an internal vertex if it is not a leaf. We draw trees the natural way,\nwith the root downwards. An automorphism of a tree t is an automorphism\nof the partially ordered set.\nA forest is a finite, partially ordered set satisfying only property (ii) of the\nabove. A forest always is a disjoint union of trees, its connected components.\nA rooted tree can be pictured as a tree with unlabeled vertices and uncolored\nedges. A forest is a set of these.\nIn the sequel we need trees with colored edges. That is, there is a function\nfrom the set of edges to a fixed set of colors. Vertices can be labeled as well\n(i.e. there is a function from the set of vertices to a fixed set of labels). Also\ntrees with a linear ordering on the incoming edges at each vertex are used.\nA colored forest is a linearly ordered set of colored trees. An automorphism\nof a colored tree is an automorphism of the underlying tree compatible with\nthe coloring of the edges.\nWe consider two operations on trees: cutting and grafting. Let s and t be\ntrees and let v \u2208 t be a vertex of t. Define s \u25e6v t to be the tree that as a\nset is the disjoint union of s and t endowed with the ordering obtained by\nadding the edge v < rs . This operation is called grafting s onto v. When\nusing trees with colored edges, we write s \u25e6iv t for grafting s onto v by an\nedge of color i. For trees with labeled vertices, grafting preserves the labels.\nThe operation of grafting s on t is visualized below.\nA cut in a tree t is a subset of the set of edges of t. A cut is admissible if for\neach leaf m of t the unique path m > . . . > x2 > x1 > r to the root contains\n\n\fSome Hopf algebras of trees\n\n3\n\nrs\nv\n\nFigure 1: grafting s on t\n\nat most one edge of the cut. Removing the edges in a cut c yields a forest.\nWe denote by Rc (t) the connected component of this forest containing the\nroot and by P c (t) the complement of Rc (t). We denote the set of admissible\ncuts of t by C(t). For colored and labeled trees, cutting preserves the colors\nof edges that are not cut and labels of vertices. The left picture below shows\nan admissible cut, whereas the cut on the right is not admissible.\n\nFigure 2: an admissible cut (left) and a non-admissible cut (right)\n\nWe describe the Hopf algebra HR of rooted trees (defined in ConnesKreimer [3]) as follows. Let k be a field. The set of rooted trees and\nthe empty set generate a Hopf algebra over k. As an algebra it is the\npolynomial algebra in formal variables t, one for each rooted tree. Thus HR\nis spanned by forests. Multiplication corresponds to taking the direct union.\nThe algebra HR is of course commutative. The unit is the empty tree.\nComultiplication \u2206 is defined on rooted trees t and extended as a algebra\nhomomorphism:\n\u2206(t) =\n\nX\n\nP c (t) \u2297 Rc (t),\n\nc\u2208C(t)\n\nwhere the sum is over admissible cuts. The counit \u03b5 : HR \u2192 k takes value\n1 on the empty tree and 0 on other trees.\nThe Hopf algebra HR is Z-graded with respect to the number of vertices in\nforests. The homogeneous elements of degree m are products t1 * . . . * tn of\nP\ntrees, such that\n|ti | = m. Both the product and the coproduct preserve\nthe grading.\n\n\fSome Hopf algebras of trees\n\n4\n\nDenote by V \u2217 the graded dual of a graded vector space V :\nV\u2217 =\n\nM\n\n(Vn )\u2217 ,\n\nn\n\nthe direct sum of the duals of the spaces of homogeneous elements. A basis\nP\nfor (HR )\u2217n is {Dt1 *...*tk | i |ti | = n}, the dual basis to the basis for (HR )n\n\u2217 is a cocommutative Hopf algebra,\ngiven by products of trees. Of course, HR\nwith comultiplication\n\u2206(Dt1 *...*tk ) =\n\nk\nX\n\nX\n\nDt\u03c3\u22121 (1) ,... ,t\u03c3\u22121 (i) \u2297 Dt\u03c3\u22121 (i+1) ,... ,t\u03c3\u22121 (k) ,\n\ni=0 \u03c3\u2208S(i,k\u2212i)\n\nwhere S(i, k \u2212 i) is the set of (i, k \u2212 i)-shuffles in Sk . We sum over these to\navoid repetition of terms in the right hand side. The primitive elements are\nthose dual to (single) rooted trees.\n\u2217 as its\nAs proved by Connes and Kreimer [3], the Lie algebra which has HR\nuniversal enveloping algebra is the linear span of rooted trees with the Lie\nbracket\n\n[Dt , Ds ] =\n\nX\n\n(n(t, s, u) \u2212 n(s, t, u))Du ,\n\nu\n\nwhere n(t, s, u) is the number of admissible cuts c of u such that P c (u) = t\nand Rc (u) = s. Chapoton and Livernet [2] show that this is the Lie algebra\nassociated to the free pre-Lie algebra on one generator (cf. section 7 for\ndetails).\n\n3\n\nOperads\n\n3.1 Convention For the rest of this paper, we restrict to the category of\nvector spaces over a fixed field k, but the general theory carries over to any\nsymmetric monoidal category with countable coproducts and quotients of\nactions by finite groups on objects (cf. Moerdijk [13]).\nLet kSn denote the group algebra of the permutation group Sn on n objects. An operad P in this paper will mean an operad with unit. Thus an\noperad consists of a collection of right kSn -modules P(n), together with an\nassociative, kSn -equivariant composition\n\u03b3 : P(n) \u2297 P(m1 ) \u2297 . . . \u2297 P(mn ) \u2212\u2192 P(m1 + . . . + mn ),\nsuch that there exists an identity id : k \u2192 P(1) with the obvious property\nand a unit u : k \u2192 P(0), which need not be an isomorphism. The existence\n\n\fSome Hopf algebras of trees\n\n5\n\nof the unit map is the only change with respect to the usual definition of an\noperad (consult Kriz and May [8], or Ginzburg and Kapranov [7], or Getzler\nand Jones [6]). Following Getzler and Jones [6] we define an operad with\nmultiplication as an operad together with an associative element \u03bc \u2208 P(2).\nThe category of pointed vector spaces has as objects vector spaces V\nwith a base point u : k \u2192 V . Morphisms are base point preserving k-linear\nmaps. We use notation 1 := u(1). There are some canonical functors: The\nforgetful functor to vector spaces will be used implicitly. The free associative\nalgebra functor T on a pointed vector space V is left adjoint to the forgetful\nfunctor from unital associative algebras to pointed vector spaces.\nFor any pointed vector space V , there is an operad EndV such that EndV (n) =\nHomk (V \u2297n , V ). The pointed structure of V is only used to to define\nu : k \u2192 End(V )(0), the elements of Homk (V \u2297n , V ) need not preserve the\nbase point. A P-algebra structure on V is a map of operads (i.e. preserving\nrelevant structure) from P to EndV . Equivalently, a P-algebra is a vector\nspace V together with linear maps\n\u03b3V : P(n) \u2297kSn (V \u2297m1 \u2297 . . . \u2297 V \u2297mn ) \u2212\u2192 V \u2297m1 +...mn ,\ncompatible with composition in P and unit in the natural sense.\n3.2 Example Let k be the operad, with k(0) = k = k(1) and k(n) = 0,\notherwise (with u = id). Algebras for k are pointed vector spaces. The\noperad k is the initial operad in our setting.\nWe denote by Com the operad with as algebras unital commutative algebras.\nThis operad satisfies Com(n) = k for all n (where u : k \u2192 k is the identity\nmap).\nLikewise Ass is the operad satisfying Ass(n) = kSn , the group algebra of Sn ,\nas a right Sn -module. The Ass-algebras are unital associative algebras. An\noperad with multiplication is an operad P together with a map of operads\nfrom Ass to P.\nA map of operads \u03c6 : P \u2192 Q induces an obvious functor \u03c6\u2217 : Q-Alg \u2192 P-Alg.\nThis functor has a left adjoint \u03c6! : P-Alg \u2192 Q-Alg. Let P be any operad\nand let i : k \u2192 P be the unique inclusion of operads. Then i! is the unitary\nfree P-algebra functor.\nLet P be an operad. We can form the operad P[\u03bbn ] by adjoining a free n-ary\noperation to P(n). Algebras for P[\u03bbn ] are just P-algebras A endowed with\na linear map \u03b1 : A\u2297n \u2192 A. The reader familiar with the collections (cf.\nGetzler and Jones [6], or Ginzburg and Kapranov [7]), will recognize P[\u03bbn ]\n\n\fSome Hopf algebras of trees\n\n6\n\nas the coproduct of operads\nP[\u03bbn ] = P \u2295k F En\nof P and the free operad F En on the collection En defined by En (n) = kSn\nand En (m) = 0 for m 6= n.\nDenote the initial P[\u03bbn ]-algebra P[\u03bbn ](0) by Pn . For any P[\u03bbn ]-algebra\n(A, \u03b1), there is by definition an unique P-algebra morphism \u03b3 such that\nthe following diagram commutes.\nPn\u2297n\n\n\u03bbn\n\n/ Pn\n\u03b3\n\n\u03b3 \u2297n\n\n\u000f\n\nA\u2297n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u000f\n\n/A\n\nThe operad P[\u03bbn ] can be described in terms of planar trees. A planar tree is\nunderstood to have a linear ordering on the incoming edges at each vertex\nand might have external edges. There is a linear ordering on all external\nedges. An element of P[\u03bbn ](m) can be represented by a tree with m external\nedges and each vertex v with n incoming edges labeled either by an element\nof P(n) or by \u03bbn . We identify two such representing trees if they can be\nreduced to the same tree using edge contractions implied by composition in\nP, equivariance with respect to the kSn -action at each internal vertex v and\nkSm -equivariance at the external edges. The initial P[\u03bbn ]-algebra P[\u03bbn ](0)\nis described by such trees without external edges.\n3.3 Example Let P = Com. The initial algebra Cn = Com[\u03bbn ](0) can\nbe described as the free commutative algebra on trees with edges colored\nby {1, . . . , n} (and no ordering on the edges). A bijection T is given by\ninduction on the number of applications of \u03bb as follows. T (1) = 1 = \u2205, and\nT (\u03bb(1, . . . , 1)) = r (the one vertex tree), and T (\u03bb(x1 , . . . , xn ) is the tree\nobtained from the forest x1 * . . . * xn by adjoining a new root and connecting\nthe roots of each tree in xi to the new root by an edge of color i. Figure 3\nshows (twice) the tree T (\u03bb(x, \u03bb(xx, 1)\u03bb(x, 1))) in C2 , where x = \u03bb(1, 1).\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\nFigure 3: trees not equal in A2 , but equal in C2\n\n\fSome Hopf algebras of trees\n\n7\n\n3.4 Example Let P = Ass. The initial algebra An = Ass[\u03bbn ](0) can be\ndescribed as the free associative algebra on trees with edges colored by\n{1, . . . , n} and at each vertex the incoming edges of each color endowed\nwith a linear ordering. Equivalently, we could say, a linear ordering on\nall incoming edges extending the ordering on the colors. A bijection is\ngiven by the map T with the same inductive definition as in the previous example, but using associative multiplication. In the associative\ncase, the two trees in figure 3 are not identified. The tree to the right\nin figure 3 is T (\u03bb(x, \u03bb(x, 1)\u03bb(xx, 1))) in A2 , while the tree to the left is\nT (\u03bb(x, \u03bb(xx, 1)\u03bb(x, 1))) (where x = \u03bb(1, 1)).\n3.5 Example Let P = k. Then kn = k[\u03bbn ](0) can be identified with the free\nvector space on trees (not forests, but possibly empty) with edges labeled\nby {1, . . . , n} and at most one incoming edge of each color at each vertex.\nFor the relation to n-ary trees, see section 8.\n\n4\n\nHopf Operads\n\nA Hopf operad (cf. Getzler and Jones [6], and also Moerdijk [13]) is an\noperad in the category of coalgebras over k. Thus, a Hopf operad P is a\n(k linear) operad together with a morphisms\n\u2206\n\n\u03b5\n\nk \u2190\u2212 P(n) \u2212\u2192 P(n) \u2297 P(n),\nsuch that \u2206 and \u03b5 satisfy the usual axioms of a coalgebra: \u2206 is coassociative\nand \u03b5 is a counit for \u2206 (cf. Sweedler [15]), and such that the composition \u03b3\nof the operad is a coalgebra morphism. Moreover, \u2206 should be compatible\nwith the kSn -action, where P(n) \u2297 P(n) is a kSn - module via the diagonal\ncoproduct. For any Hopf operad P, the tensor product of two P-algebras is\na P-algebra again.\nA Hopf P-algebra A is a P-algebra A in the category of (counital!) coalgebras. Note that we can not use the description of algebras in terms of the\nendomorphism operad in the category of coalgebras, since coalgebra homomorphisms do not form a linear space. In this generality it is not natural to\nconsider antipodes. A Hopf Ass-algebra is just a bialgebra.\nLet \u03c6 : Q \u2192 P be a map of Hopf operads. The map \u03c6 induces functors\n\u03c6\u2217 : P-Alg \u2192 Q-Alg\n\nand\n\n\u03c6\u0304\u2217 : P-HopfAlg \u2192 Q-HopfAlg.\n\nThe map \u03c6\u2217 has a left adjoint \u03c6! (we work with k-vector spaces). Note that\n\u03c6\u2217 (k) = k and for P-algebras A and B we have \u03c6\u2217 (A \u2297 B) = \u03c6\u2217 (A) \u2297 \u03c6\u2217 (B)\n\n\fSome Hopf algebras of trees\n\n8\n\n(the map \u03c6 is compatible with \u2206). Using this observation, conclude that\nthe adjunction induces algebra maps \u03c6! (k) = \u03c6! \u03c6\u2217 (k) \u2192 k and \u03c6! (A \u2297 B) \u2192\n\u03c6! (\u03c6\u2217 \u03c6! A \u2297 \u03c6\u2217 \u03c6! B) \u2192 \u03c6! (A) \u2297 \u03c6! (B). These maps serve to show that \u03c6!\nlifts to a left adjoint\n\u03c6\u0304! : Q-HopfAlg \u2212\u2192 P-HopfAlg\nof \u03c6\u0304\u2217 .\nLet P be a Hopf operad. The aim of this section is to state a general result\non Hopf operad structures on P[\u03bbn ]. We use the notations \u03bb = \u03bbn and\nPn = P[\u03bbn ](0) when no confusion can arise.\nLet (A, \u03b1) be a P[\u03bbn ]-algebra and let \u03c31 , \u03c32 : A\u2297n \u2192 A be a pair of linear\nmaps and define for each such pair a map (\u03c31 , \u03c32 ) : (A \u2297 A)\u2297n \u2192 A \u2297 A by\n(\u03c31 , \u03c32 ) = (\u03c31 \u2297 \u03b1n + \u03b1n \u2297 \u03c32 ) \u25e6 \u03c4,\nwhere \u03c4 is the n-fold twist map which identifies (A \u2297 A)\u2297n with A\u2297n \u2297 A\u2297n\nby the symmetry of the tensor product. For vector spaces V1 , . . . , V2n , the\nmap \u03c4 is the natural map\n\u03c4 : V1 \u2297 . . . \u2297 V2n 7\u2192 V1 \u2297 . . . V2n\u22121 \u2297 V2 \u2297 V4 . . . \u2297 V2n\ninduced by the symmetry (in the dg case this involves some signs).\nWe now list some results for linear maps \u03c3i that define a Hopf algebra\nstructure on Pn but do not extend to P[\u03bbn ]. The results in this section are\nobtained along the same lines as the results in Moerdijk [13]. Our approach\nis more general in the sense that Moerdijk considered only the case n = 1.\nLet (Pn , \u03bbn ) be the initial P[\u03bbn ]-algebra. For any pair of n-ary linear\nmaps \u03c31 , \u03c32 there is a unique P[\u03bbn ]-algebra morphism (Pn , \u03bbn ) \u2192 (Pn \u2297\nPn , (\u03c31 , \u03c32 )). That is, a unique P -algebra morphism such that\n\u03bb\n\nPn\u2297n\n\n/ Pn\n\n\u2206\u2297n\n\n\u000f\n\n(Pn \u2297 Pn\n\n(\u03c31 ,\u03c32 )\n/\n)\u2297n\n\n\u2206\n\n\u000f\n\nPn \u2297 Pn\n\ncommutes. Define \u03b5 : Pn \u2192 k as the unique P[\u03bb]-algebra morphism\n(Pn , \u03bbn ) \u2192 (k, 0), which extends \u03b5 : P (0) \u2192 k. The following proposition\nis a generalization of Moerdijks construction [13]. The proof is completely\nanalogous.\n4.1 Proposition Let n \u2208 N, \u03bbn and Pn be defined as above. Let \u03c3i :\nPn\u2297n \u2192 Pn for i = 1, 2 be linear maps. If \u03c3i satisfies\n\u01eb \u25e6 \u03c3i = \u01eb\u2297n , and\n(\u03c3i \u2297 \u03c3i ) \u25e6 \u03c4 \u25e6 \u2206\u2297n = \u2206 \u25e6 \u03c3i ;\n\n\fSome Hopf algebras of trees\n\n9\n\nthen there exists a unique Hopf-P algebra structure on Pn extending the Hopf\nP -algebra structure on P (0) such that \u2206\u25e6\u03bb = (\u03c31 , \u03c32 )\u25e6\u03c4 \u25e6\u2206\u2297n and \u03b5\u25e6\u03bb = 0.\nIn the following examples |t| denotes the number of applications of \u03bbn in an\nelement t \u2208 P[\u03bbn ](m), for any m. In the case P = Ass, or P = Com, or P = k\nthis corresponds to counting the number of vertices in a tree.\n4.2 Example Let P be a Hopf operad.

Then \u03c3 = p \u2208 P(n) defines a natural\nn-twisting function. More generally, if \u03c3 = (\u03b5\u2297k \u2297 p)\u03c4 for some p \u2208 P(n \u2212 k)\nand some \u03c4 \u2208 Sn , then \u03c3 defines a natural n-twisting function.\nWe now characterize the universal property of the Hopf P -algebra Pn . Again\nthis is a direct generalization of Moerdijk [13].\n5.2 Theorem Let (\u03c31 , \u03c32 ) be a pair of natural twisting functions of Hopf\nP-algebras, satisfying the conditions of Theorem 4.1 and endow Pn with the\ninduced Hopf P-algebra structure. For every Hopf P-algebra B, there is a\none-one correspondence between\n(i). Hopf P-algebra maps c\u03b2 : Pn \u2192 B that lift to a map (Pn , \u03bb) \u2192 (B, \u03b2)\nof P[\u03bbn ]-algebras and\n(ii). cocycles \u03b2 in the (\u03c31 , \u03c32 )-twisted complex of B.\n\n\fSome Hopf algebras of trees\n\n11\n\nProof The previous paragraph shows that \u03bb is a cocycle in the (\u03c31 , \u03c32 )complex of Pn with respect to the (\u03c31 , \u03c32 )-coproduct on Pn .\nFirst suppose that c\u03b2 has such a lift c\u03b2 : (Pn , \u03bb) \u2192 (B, \u03b2) (which is obviously\nunique). Since \u03c31 and \u03c32 are natural n-twisting functions and c\u03b2 is a map\nof augmented P-algebras, we have the following commutative diagram of\nP[\u03bbn ]-algebras:\n\u2206\n\n(Pn , \u03bb)\n\n/ (Pn \u2297 Pn , (\u03c31 , \u03c32 ))\n\nc\n\nc\u2297c\n\n\u000f\n\u000f\n\n(B, \u03b2)\n\n\u2206\n\n/ (B \u2297 B, (\u03c31 , \u03c32 )).\n\nThis shows that \u2206 \u25e6 \u03b2 = (\u03c31 , \u03c32 ) \u25e6 \u2206, which is the cocycle relation for \u03b2 in\nthe (\u03c31 , \u03c32 )-twisted complex.\nLet \u03b2 be a cocycle in the (\u03c31 , \u03c32 )-twisted complex of B. Then (by the\nuniversal property of Pn ) there is a unique P[\u03bbn ]-algebra map c : (Pn , \u03bb) \u2192\n(B, \u03b2). We are done as soon as we have verified that the diagram above\nis a commutative diagram of P[\u03bbn ]-algebras. To show commutativity of\nthe diagram, note that the universal property of Pn shows that \u03b5 \u25e6 c = \u03b5\nis the unique morphism of (Pn , \u03bb) to (k, 0). The intertwining relation for\nnatural n-twisting functions with respect to augmented P algebra morphisms\nnow implies that c \u2297 c is a morphism of P[\u03bbn ]-algebras. Since both c and\n\u2206 are maps of P[\u03bbn ]-algebras, the universal property of Pn implies that\nboth composites in the diagram are the unique P[\u03bbn ]-algebra morphism from\n(Pn , \u03bb) to (B \u2297 B, (\u03c31 , \u03c32 )).\nQED\nThe result above tells us that P[\u03bbn ] has the following universal property\nin twisted coalgebra Hochschild cohomology, which we state once more in\nP[\u03bbn ]-free language.\n5.3 Corollary Let (B, \u03b2) be a pair of a Hopf P-algebra together with a\ncocycle in the (\u03c31 , \u03c32 )-twisted complex.

The augmentation ideal of a connected Hopf algebra A is the ideal\nL\nn\u22651 An .\n6.4 Lemma (Milnor and Moore [12]) Let A be a connected Hopf Assalgebra. Then there exists an antipode on A which for x in the augmentation\nideal is given by\n\u221e\nX\n \u0304 (k) (x),\nS(x) =\n(\u22121)k+1 \u03bc(k) \u25e6 \u2206\nk=1\n\n \u0304 = \u2206 \u2212 (id \u2297 1 + 1 \u2297 id), and \u03bc(0) = id = \u2206\n \u0304 (0) , and \u03bc(k) : A\u2297k+1 \u2192 A\nwhere \u2206\n \u0304 (k) : A \u2192 A\u2297k+1 are defined using (co)associativity for k > 0 and\nand \u2206\n \u0304 (0) .\n\u03bc(0) = id = \u2206\n6.5 Corollary Under the assumptions of convention 6.1, there exists an\nantipode on the Hopf algebra of theorem 6.3, given by the formula\nS(t) =\n\n|t|\nX\nX\nk=1 \u222ai si =t\n\n(\u22121)k s1 * . . . * sk\n\nY\n\nq(sj , sj+1 \u222a . . . \u222a sk , sj \u222a . . . \u222a sk ),\n\n1\u2264j<k\n\nwhere we only sum over partitions t = s1 \u222a . . . \u222a sk of the forest t with all\nforests si non-empty.\nProof The grading with respect to |t| gives a grading that makes the Lie\nalgebra connected, since Com(0) = k.\nQED\n\n\fSome Hopf algebras of trees\n\n15\n\n6.6 Example In the case n = 1 with q1 = 1 and q2 = 0 we get the formula\nof Connes and Kreimer [3] for the antipode on the Hopf algebra HR of section\n2. Note that according to example 5.5 the Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra is\nthe initial Hopf algebra for the Hopf operad Com[\u03bb1 ].\nWe now state a corollary to the formula for the coproduct in theorem 6.3,\nthat gives an explicit formula for the Lie bracket on the primitive elements\nof the cocommutative Hopf algebra Cn\u2217 . We know by the Milnor-Moore\ntheorem [12] that Cn\u2217 is the universal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra\nof its primitive elements.\n6.7 Corollary Let P = Com, and t \u2208 Cn , and \u2206 = \u2206q1 1 ...q2 n ; then the\ngraded dual Cn\u2217 is the universal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra which\nas a vector space is spanned by elements Dt , where t is a rooted tree in Cn .\nThe bracket is given by [Ds , Dt ] = Ds \u2217 Dt \u2212 Dt \u2217 Ds , where\nDs \u2217 Dt =\n\nX\n\nq(s, w) Dw ,\n\nw=s\u222at\n\nthe sum ranges over all rooted trees in Cn that have s and t as complementary\ncolored subforests.\nProof For any cocommutative Hopf algebra we can define an operation\n\u2217 on the primitive elements, such that its commutator is the Lie bracket\non primitive elements: Simply define \u2217 as the truncation of the product at\ndegree > 1, with respect to the primitive filtration F . In this case, Fm Cn\u2217 is\nspanned by the elements Du dual to forests u consisting of at most m trees.\nThe product in Cn\u2217 is determined by the coproduct in Cn . Explicitly, for\nforest u, we can write the multiplication in Cn\u2217 as\nDs Dt (u) = (Ds \u2297 Dt )\u2206(u)\nX\n=\nq(w, u)Ds (w)Dt (wc ).\nu=w\u222aw c\n\nWhen we then restrict to the primitive part, we conclude that Ds \u2217 Dt is\ngiven by the desired formula.\nQED\n\n6.8 Remark With some minor changes, there is an analogue of the above\nfor the case P = Ass. The only change is that we have to remember the\nordering of up-going edges at each vertex. To be very explicit, for the\ncoproduct on An = Ass[\u03bbn ](0) we have the formula\n\u2206(t) =\n\nXY\ns\u2282t\n\nj\n\nP\n\nq1 jv\u2208s\n\npj (v,s,t)\n\n*\n\nY\nj\n\nP\n\nq2 jv\u2208t\n\npj (v,sc ,t)\n\ns \u2297 sc ,\n\n\fSome Hopf algebras of trees\n\n16\n\nwhere the product of trees is associative, non-commutative. The order of\nmultiplication is given by the linear order on the roots of the trees defined\nby the linear on the incoming edges at each vertex and the partial order on\nvertices. Dually, the primitive elements of the dual are again spanned by\nelements dual to single rooted trees (with linear ordering on incoming edges\nin each vertex). The truncated product \u2217 is given by\nDs \u2217 Dt =\n\nX Y\nw=s\u222at j\n\nP\n\nq1 j\n\nv\u2208s pj (v,s,w)\n\n*\n\nY\n\nP\n\nq2 jv\u2208t\n\npj (v,t,w)\n\nDw ,\n\nj\n\nwhere w, s and t are trees with a linear ordering on the incoming edges of\nthe same color at each vertex and the inclusions of s and t in w have to\nrespect these orderings.\n6.9 Example Independently, Foissy [4] has found this formula for the Lie\nbracket in the case where n = 1, q1 = 1 and q2 = 0 (and Ass is the underlying\noperad), and established the universal property of section 5, which in this\ncase also follows from Moerdijk [13]. He uses this formula to give an explicit\nisomorphism between the Hopf algebras A1 and A\u22171 in this case. Moreover,\nhe does the same for planar trees with labeled vertices. The labeled case\ncorresponds to iterated addition of unitary operations, using the same q1\nand q2 at each stage.\n6.10 Remark For certain values of the parameters qij , the formula of theorem 6.3 defines a coproduct on k[\u03bbn ](0). If for fixed i = 1, 2 there is at\nmost one j such that qij 6= 0, then the subspace spanned by single rooted\ntrees which do not involve multiplication is preserved under \u2206. Since this\nsubspace is isomorphic to k[\u03bbn ](0), this implies that in this case the formulas\nabove define a coproduct on k[\u03bbn ](0). Consequently, this defines an operation \u2217 on the dual, since each element in the dual is primitive. A formula\nfor this is given by the formula for Com, modulo trees involving multiplication (their span is denoted \u03bc): the quotient Com[\u03bbn ](0)\u2217 /(\u03bc) is canonically\nisomorphic to k[\u03bbn ](0)\u2217 .\n\n7\n\nPre-Lie algebras\n\nA (right) pre-Lie algebra (cf. Gerstenhaber [5], and Chapoton and Livernet [2]) is a k-vector space L together with a bilinear map \u2212 \u2217 \u2212 : L \u00d7 L \u2192 L\nwhich satisfies\n(x \u2217 y) \u2217 z \u2212 x \u2217 (y \u2217 z) = (x \u2217 z) \u2217 y \u2212 x \u2217 (z \u2217 y),\n\n\fSome Hopf algebras of trees\n\n17\n\nfor each x, y and z in L. Note that the bracket [x, y] = x \u2217 y \u2212 y \u2217 x defines a\nLie algebra structure on L. This Lie algebra is the associated Lie Algebra\nof the pre-Lie algebra (L, \u2217).\nRemember from [2] that the free pre-Lie algebra Lp on p generators is given\nby the vector space spanned by rooted trees with vertices labeled with elements of p = {1, 2, . . . , p}. The pre-Lie algebra product is given by grafting\ntrees. That is,\nX\nt\u2217s=\ns \u25e6v t\nv\u2208t\n\nfor trees s and t, where the color of the vertices is preserved. For any tree\nt \u2208 Lp define ri (t) to be the tree t with the color of the root changed to i.\nThus ri defines a linear endomorphism of the vector space Lp .\n7.1 Convention Let P = Com, choose \u2206 on Cn = Com[\u03bbn ](0) defined by\n\u03c3i as in the deformation used in convention 6.1 and use the notation \u03c7S to\ndenote the characteristic function of a subset S \u2282 X which has value 1 on\nS and value 0 on X \u2212 S. Denote the primitive elements of a coalgebra C by\nP (C).\nLet t \u2208 Cn be a tree. Then we call the p-connected component of t the\nsubtree consisting of vertices connected to the root by a path with edges\ncolored exclusively by elements of p.\n7.2 Proposition Let p \u2282 {1, . . . , n} and define q1j = \u03c7p (j) and q2j = 0.\nThen\n(i). The product \u2217 of corollary 6.7 defines a pre-Lie algebra structure on\nthe primitive elements P (Cn\u2217 ) of Cn\u2217 .\n(ii). If p = {1, . . . , n}, then there is a natural inclusion of this pre-Lie\nalgebra into the free pre-Lie algebra on n generators. The image in\nP\nthe free pre-Lie algebra is spanned by all sums i\u2208p ti , of trees that\nonly differ in that the color of the root of ti is i.\nProof First note that with this choice of \u03c3i , the formula for the coproduct\nsimplifies to\nX\n\u2206(t) =\nP c (t) \u2297 Rc (t),\nc\u2208C(t)\n\nwhere we sum over admissible cuts as described in section 2, provided that\nthe cuts are at edges in the p-connected component of t. To see this, consider\nthe formula of corollary 6.7 and note that the coefficient of s \u2297 sc is 0 iff sc\n\n\fSome Hopf algebras of trees\n\n18\n\nhas a connected component with respect to edges of colors in p which does\nnot contain the root.\nThe operation \u2217 of theorem 6.7 is then given by\nXX\nDs \u2217 Dt =\nnp (s, t, u)Du ,\nu p\u2208p\n\nwhere u ranges over trees, and np (s, t, u) denotes the number of admissible\ncuts c of u that only cut p-colored edges in the p-connected component of\nu and satisfy P c (u) = t and Rc (u) = s.\nTo check the pre-Lie algebra identity, note that Du \u2217(Dt \u2217Ds )\u2212(Du \u2217Dt )\u2217Ds\nP\nis exactly w n(u, t, s, w)Dw , where n(u, t, s, w) is the number of admissible\ncuts c of w, such that P c (w) = u * t and Rc (w) = s. Since n(t, u, s, w) =\nn(u, t, s, w) part (i) follows.\nFor a tree t, we denote the cardinality of the automorphism group of t by\nat . If Dt \u2208 P (Cn\u2217 ) and v a vertex of t, denote by avt the cardinality of the\ngroup of automorphisms of t that have v as a fixed point. Define m(v, t)\nthe cardinality of the orbit of v under the action by the automorphisms of\nt. Let s, t \u2208 Cn be trees and define u = s \u25e6pv t. We now see that\nX\nau =\nas * avt * np (s, t, u).\np\n\nLet p = {1, . . . , n) and consider the pre-Lie algebra of (i). We claim that\nthere is an isomorphism of pre-Lie algebras from this pre-Lie algebra to the\npre Lie algebra on the same vector space Cn with multiplication given by\nXX\nDs\u25e6pv t .\nDs \u2217\u2032 Dt =\nv\u2208t\n\np\n\nDefine a linear automorphism of P (Cn\u2217 ) by \u03c6(Dt ) = at Dt . We have to show\nthat \u03c6(Ds \u2217 Dt ) = \u03c6(Ds ) \u2217\u2032 \u03c6(Dt ). Write\nXX\nDs\u25e6pv t\nDs \u2217\u2032 Dt =\n=\n\nv\u2208t p\nX\nX\n\nDu m(v, t)\n\np u=s\u25e6pv t\n\nwhere the sum in the second line is over all u that can be written as s \u25e6pv t\nfor some v and where for each such u we fix a decomposition of each such\nu as u = s \u25e6pv t. To show that \u03c6 is a pre-Lie algebra morphism, we have to\nshow that for any such u,\nX\nas * at * np (s, t, u) = au m(v, t).\np\n\nThis follows from the above since at = avt * m(v, t).\n\n\fSome Hopf algebras of trees\n\n19\n\nA map from the pre-Lie algebra (P (Cn\u2217 ), \u2217\u2032 ) into the free pre-Lie algebra on\nn generators (trees with n-colored vertices) is given by assigning the color\nof an edge to the vertex on top and summing over all colors in p for the\nroot. That this is an inclusion of pre-Lie algebras and that the image can\nbe described as in (ii) is a direct consequence of the definitions.\nQED\n\n7.3 Example In the case n = 1, p = {1}, this yields the identification\n\u2217 with the pre-Lie product \u2217 as in\nof L1 with the primitive elements of HR\nChapoton and Livernet [2].\n\n8\n\nThe Pruning coproduct\n\nBrouder and Frabetti [1] use a pruning operator on planar binary trees to\ndefine a coproduct on the k-vector space spanned by planar binary trees.\nWe will see that this coproduct is related to the coproducts described in\nsection 6. We first give a family of coproducts on planar n-ary trees. In\nthis context the pruning Hopf algebra of Brouder and Frabetti is a direct\ncorollary.\nA planar binary tree is a non-empty oriented planar graph in which each\nvertex which is not a leaf or the root has exactly two direct predecessors\nand one direct successor. Let T be a planar binary tree. We call each vertex\nwhich is not a leaf a internal vertex of T . If T has n + 1 leaves, it has n\ninternal vertices. Following Loday and Ronco, we denote the k-linear span\nof the set of planar binary trees k[Y\u221e ]. On planar binary trees we have the\nbinary operation \u03bb adding a new root (smallest element) to the union of\nplanar binary trees T1 and T2 .\nLikewise, we define a planar n-ary tree as a non-empty oriented graph in\nwhich each vertex which is not a leaf has exactly n direct predecessors and\none direct successor. The n-ary operation \u03bb adds a new root to an n-tuple\nof planar n-ary trees. Denote the vector space spanned by the set of n-ary\n(n)\n(n)\nplanar trees by k[Y\u221e ]. The basepoint in k[Y\u221e ] is the tree with one leaf.\n8.1 Proposition Let n \u2265 0.\n(n)\n\n(i). The pointed vector space k[Y\u221e ] is isomorphic to k[\u03bbn ](0).\n(ii). The unitary free associative algebra on the pointed vector space spanned\nby planar n-ary trees has a family of natural Hopf algebra structures\nparameterized by i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}.\n\n\fSome Hopf algebras of trees\n\n20\n\n(n)\n\nProof Define a bijection \u03be : k[Y\u221e ] \u2192 k[\u03bbn ](0) by mapping the planar\nn-ary tree with one leaf to the empty tree and\n\u03be(\u03bb(T1 , . . . , Tn )) = \u03bbn (\u03be(T1 ), . . . , \u03be(Tn )),\nfor planar n-ary trees Ti . Each vertex in a tree in k[\u03bbn ](0) corresponds to\nan internal vertex in the corresponding n-ary tree. It is easy to check that\nthis is a basepoint preserving bijection of bases. This proves (i).\nLet i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}. The coproducts induces by q1j = \u03c7{i} (j) and q2j = 0\nare well defined on k[\u03bbn ](0) by remark 6.10. This shows that we have a\nfamily of coproducts on k[\u03bbn ](0). The result (ii) is now a direct consequence\nof the deformation in remark 6.8 and functorial properties. The functor\n\u012b! : k[\u03bbn ]-HopfAlg \u2192 Ass[\u03bbn ]-HopfAlg induced by the inclusion of Hopf\noperads i : k \u2192 Ass is the unitary free algebra functor and the result follows\nby functoriality.\nQED\n\n8.2 Corollary (Brouder and Frabetti [1]) Let the pruning operator\nP : k[Y\u221e ] \u2192 k[Y\u221e ] \u2297 k[Y\u221e ] be defined inductively as\nP (\u03bb(T, 1)) = 0\nX\n\u03bb(T, Si\u2032 ) \u2297 Si\u2032\u2032 + \u03bb(T, 1) \u2297 S,\nP (\u03bb(T, S) =\nif P (S) =\n\nP\n\ni\n\ni\n\nSi\u2032 \u2297 Si\u2032\u2032 .

Milnor and Moore [12]). The Milnor-Moore theorem gives an equivalence of\ncategories between the category of cocommutative Hopf algebras and the\ncategory of Lie algebras (in characteristic 0). A Milnor-Moore theorem for\ndendriform Hopf algebras can be found in Ronco [14]. This theorem states\nthe equivalence of dendriform Hopf algebras and brace algebras.\n9.2 Convention Let k, l \u2208 N. Use P = k, and take q1j = \u03b4kj and q2j = \u03b4lj\nto define \u03c31 and \u03c32 in the deformation of 6.3. According to remark 6.10 this\nchoice of parameters indeed defines a coproduct on k[\u03bbp ](0).\nWe use the augmentation of u\u2217 : k[\u03bb](0)\u2217 \u2192 k.\n9.3 Proposition Consider the graded vector space (k[\u03bbp ](0))\u2217 , graded by\nthe number of applications of \u03bbp in trees. Then the augmentation ideal of\n(k[\u03bbp ](0))\u2217 is a graded dendriform algebra with associated multiplication \u2217.\nProof The most convenient way to check the statement is to give an inductive characterization of the operations \u227a and \u227b. To avoid awesome notation,\nwe identify trees t with their dual Dt .\nThe product is characterized by its unit 1 = \u2205 (= D\u2205 ), and the identity\ns \u2217 t = \u03bb(s1 , . . . , sk \u2217 t, . . . , sn ) + \u03bb(t1 , . . . , s \u2217 tl , . . . , tn ),\nas is readily checked. Now define operations\ns \u227a t = \u03bb(s1 , . . . , sk \u2217 t, . . . , sn )\ns \u227b t = \u03bb(t1 , . . . , s \u2217 tl , . . . , tn ).\n\nand\n\nLet t = \u03bb(t1 , . . . , tn ), u = \u03bb(u1 , . . . , un ) and s = \u03bb(s1 , . . . , sn ) and suppose\nthat \u227a and \u227b satisfy the dendriform identities on all trees with in total\n\n\fSome Hopf algebras of trees\n\n22\n\n< |t| + |s| + |u| vertices. Then we have\n(s \u227a t) \u227a u = \u03bb(s1 , . . . , (sk \u2217 t) \u2217 u, . . . , sn )\n= \u03bb(s1 , . . . , sk \u2217 (t \u2217 u), . . . , sn )\n= s \u227a (t \u2217 u)\n(s \u227b t) \u227a u = \u03bb(t1 , . . . , s \u2217 tl , . . . , tk \u2217 u, . . . , tn )\n= s \u227b (t \u227a u).\nThe first identity follows by the definition of \u2217 and associativity on smaller\ntrees. The second is clear, but uses associativity on smaller trees in case\nk = l. The proof of the third dendriform identity can be copied from the\nfirst almost verbatim. It is now left to show that the dendriform operations\npreserve the grading in the sense that for s of degree m and t of degree\nn, the products s \u227a t and s \u227b t are of degree m + n. If the dendriform\noperations are graded in total degree smaller then m + n, assume s and t of\ndegree m and n respectively. We now know that \u2217 is graded in total degree\nsmaller then m + n. Since the definition of \u227a and \u227b only uses multiplication\nof smaller trees, one checks that the grading is preserved.\nQED\n\n10\n\nThe Loday-Ronco construction\n\nWe still assume convention 9.2. There is a isomorphism of graded vector\nspaces between k[\u03bbn ](0) and (k[\u03bbn ](0))\u2217 that maps t to Dt . Proposition\n9.3 shows that we have an associative multiplication \u2217 on (k[\u03bbn ](0))\u2217 . The\nisomorphism give an associative multiplication on k[\u03bbn ](0), which we will\nalso denote by \u2217.\nDenote by \u2217(n) : k[\u03bbn ](0)\u2297n \u2192 k[\u03bbn ](0) the map induced by the associative\nmultiplication, and by \u03b5(n) : k[\u03bbn ](0)\u2297n \u2192 k[\u03bbn ](0) the map u \u25e6 \u03b5\u2297n .\n10.1 Proposition Use convention 9.2 and let the product \u2217 of proposition\n9.3. Then \u03c31 = \u2217(n) and \u03c32 = \u03b5(n) define a Hopf algebra structure on\nk[\u03bbn ](0) iff k = n and l = 1.\nMoreover if k = n and l = 1, the augmentation ideal of k[\u03bbn ](0) is a dendriform Hopf algebra.\nProof We check the requirements of proposition 4.1. The requirement for\nthe counit is fulfilled for any element of (k[\u03bbp ](0))\u2217 . We prove the claim for\ncoassociativity inductively. Let \u03c3i as above and assume that the requirement\nfor \u2206 holds up to degree n. Then coassociativity of \u2206 holds up to degree n.\n\n\fSome Hopf algebras of trees\n\n23\n\nCompute for k = n and l = 1 (using Sweedler notation)\n\u2206(a \u2217 b) = \u2206(\u03bb(a1 , . . . , an ) \u2217 \u03bb(b1 , . . . , bn ))\n= \u2206(\u03bb(a1 , . . . , an \u2217 b) + \u2206(\u03bb(a \u2217 b1 , . . . , bn ))\nX\n=\na\u2032 \u2217 . . . \u2217 (an \u2217 b)\u2032 \u2297 \u03bb(a\u2032\u20321 , . . . , (an \u2217 b)\u2032\u2032 )\nX\n+\n(a \u2217 b1 )\u2032 \u2217 . . . \u2217 b\u2032n \u2297 \u03bb((a \u2217 b1 )\u2032\u2032 , . . . , b\u2032\u2032n )\n+ (a \u2217 b) \u2297 1\nfor a = \u03bb(a1 , . . . , an ) and b = \u03bb(b1 , . . . , bn ) such that the sum of their\ndegrees is m. Then use the induction hypothesis for degrees smaller then\nm (in particular \u2206(an \u2217 b) = \u2206(an ) \u2217 \u2206(b) and \u2206(a \u2217 b1 ) = \u2206(a) \u2217 \u2206(b1 )).\nDeduce\nX\n\u2206(a \u227a b) =\na\u2032 \u2217 b\u2032 \u2297 a\u2032\u2032 \u227a b\u2032\u2032\nand\n\u2206(a \u227b b) = a\u2032 \u2217 b\u2032 \u2297 a\u2032\u2032 \u227b b\u2032\u2032 ,\nand conclude that (k[\u03bbp ](0))\u2217 is a Hopf algebra if k = n and l = 1. The\nformulas also show that for other choices of k and l the induction fails and\ncoassociativity does not hold since \u2217 is not commutative.\n \u0304 = \u2206 \u2212 id \u2297 1 \u2212 1 \u2297 id follow from the\nThe dendriform Hopf identities for \u2206\nabove.\n\nQED\n\nLoday and Ronco [11] construct a Hopf algebra of planar binary trees. Remember the definition of the vector space k[Y\u221e ] as the vector space spanned\nby binary trees.\n10.2 Corollary (Loday and Ronco [11]) Let T, T \u2032 \u2208 k[Y\u221e ]. If T =\n\u03bb(T1 , T2 ) and S = \u03bb(S1 , S2 ), then\nT \u2217 S = \u03bb(T1 , T2 \u2217 S) + \u03bb(T \u2217 S1 S2 )\ndefines an associative product on k[Y\u221e ] with as unit the tree with one leaf.\nMoreover there is a coproduct making k[Y\u221e ] a Hopf algebra. This coproduct\nis defined inductively by\nX\n\u2206(T ) =\n(T1\u2032 \u2217 T2\u2032 ) \u2297 \u03bb(T1\u2032\u2032 , T2\u2032\u2032 ) + T \u2297 1,\nP\nwhere \u2206(T ) = (T ) T \u2032 \u2297 T \u2032\u2032 is the Sweedler notation of the coproduct. The\ncounit \u03b5 is the obvious augmentation of the product by projection on the span\nof the unit.\nFinally, the augmentation ideal is a dendriform Hopf algebra.\nProof Recognize the star product on k[\u03bb2 ](0) given by q12 = 1 = q21 and\nq11 = 0 = q22 , and the coproduct associated to \u2217.
