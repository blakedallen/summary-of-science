We have observed H\u03b1 emission from a sample of 13 star-forming galaxies\nfrom the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey in the redshift range z \u223c 1.2 \u2212 1.5 and stellar\nmass range 9.8 < log(M\u2217 /M\u2299 )< 11.6 with the integral field spectrograph OSIRIS on\nKeck, taking advantage of Laser Guide Star Adaptive Optics. We detect multiple emission, 1\u20132 kpc size sub-components, or 'clumps' within the H\u03b1 spatial emission in 4\ngalaxies, extended emission in 4 galaxies and compact spheroidal emission in 5 galaxies. Considering our results in the context of unstable disk formation and a merger\nsequence, we find evidence of ordered orbital motion in the majority of galaxies as\nwould be found in unstable gaseous disks.\n\n1.\n\nMorphologies at High Redshift\n\nMorphological studies made possible by deep imaging surveys have provided the first\nclues to the processes of high-redshift galaxy formation. It has become clear from these\nresults that high-redshift galaxies exhibit different morphologies to local galaxies, with\nhigher fractions of both compact and irregular morphologies (Glazebrook et al. 1995;\nAbraham et al. 1996). Initial interpretations of the complex structures seen in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field favor higher rates of major mergers, a natural consequence of hierarchical merging models in a \u039bCDM Universe (e.g., Conselice et al. 2003; Lotz et al.\n2006), however, additional observations of irregular galaxies reveal properties reminiscent of local disk galaxies (Elmegreen & Elmegreen 2005). Yet, unlike local disks, the\ngalaxies at high redshift contain large dense regions or 'clumps' of star formation, comparable to HII regions but of much larger size (Jones et al. 2010). Models have been developed to explain the clumpy structures in disks and their evolution into galaxies with\nmorphologies seen at z = 0 (e.g., Noguchi 1999; Immeli et al. 2004a; Bournaud et al.\n2007; Elmegreen et al. 2008).\nMorphological studies alone do not provide enough information to distinguish\nbetween these kinematically distinct theories of galaxy formation. Spatially resolved\nspectroscopy is therefore essential for disentangling kinematics and star formation histories of these complex structures at high redshift.\n1\n\n\fWisnioski et al.\n\n2\n2.\n\nKiloparsec scale Observations of Star-Forming Galaxies at z > 1\n\nThe past five years have seen a great number of integral field spectroscopy (IFS) studies\nof nebular emission line H\u03b1 in z > 1.5 star-forming galaxies (e.g., Genzel et al. 2006;\nLaw et al. 2009; Wright et al. 2009; Epinat et al. 2009; Nesvadba et al. 2008). These\nredshifts are favored for the large number of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) and submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) being discovered by methods tailored for high redshift and\nfor the accessibility of H\u03b1 in the near infrared.\nA main focus of IFS studies has been the classification of galaxies kinematically to\ndefine clear observational distinctions between disks and interacting systems. Mergers\nobserved with IFS (Nesvadba et al. 2008; Wright et al. 2009) have been found to show\nclear kinematic steps across one resolution element indicating a velocity separation between two kinematically separate systems. Some galaxies also exhibit rotational signatures across IFS results and are well fit by disk models (Genzel et al. 2006; Epinat et al.\n2009; Lemoine-Busserolle & Lamareille 2010). Yet rigidly classifying galaxies in these\ntwo distinct groups is an over-simplification. Many of the samples of > 5 galaxies\npresent a variety of kinematic types including dispersion dominated systems, stable\ndisks, unstable disks, minor mergers, merger, and merger remnants with definitions of\neach class varying from one sample to another.\n\n3.\n\nDiscovering extreme objects at z > 1 using the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey\n\nWe present integral field spectroscopy of H\u03b1 emission in 13 star-forming galaxies selected from the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey at z \u223c 1.3 (Drinkwater et al. 2010). By\nmoving to slightly lower redshifts than previous studies of LBGs and SMGs we are able\nto study the internal kinematics of galaxies of comparable intrinsic luminosities (Figure 1) but achieving higher spatial resolution and comparable signal to noise in a much\nshorter exposure time. WiggleZ galaxies are UV selected with color cuts to select the\nbluest galaxies across the whole redshift range of the survey. While the WiggleZ redshift distribution peaks at z \u223c 0.6, there exists a long thin tail of high-redshift galaxies\nthat reaches as high as z = 1.5. These galaxies are identified from strong [OII] emission\nand have star formation rates of 50\u2013500 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . There are about 100 such objects in\nthe survey. The WiggleZ survey has made the current study of intensely star-forming\ngalaxies at 1 < z < 2 possible by finding rare starbursts that would otherwise be missed.\nThese objects may be the link needed to bridge the gap between observations of local\nLIRGs/ULIRGs and high-redshift LBGs and SMGs at one of the most important epochs\nof mass assembly.\n\n4.\n\nResults\n\nWe observed 13 star-forming galaxies using OSIRIS (OH Suppressing InfraRed Imaging Spectrograph) with the Keck II laser guide star adaptive optics (LGSAO) system.\nBy using an IFU we obtain an H\u03b1 spectrum for every spatial pixel (spaxel) of the galaxy\nimage. A Gaussian profile is fitted to the H\u03b1 emission in each spaxel of the cube to map\nout the H\u03b1 flux distribution of the galaxy. A velocity map is constructed for each galaxy\nusing the velocity shifts of the emission in each spaxel relative to the galaxy redshift.\nVelocity dispersion is measured in each spaxel from the r.m.s. of the fitted Gaussian\n\n\fClumpology of Starbursts in the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey\n\n3\n\nFigure 1.\nH\u03b1 luminosity as a function of redshift for the largest high-redshift\nIFS surveys with our work shown by the red diamonds. The gray points show the\n[OII] luminosity of other WiggleZ galaxies considered for this sample. The remaining symbols are from Epinat et al. (2009); Law et al.

The kinematic maps are\nshown for three galaxies in Figure 2.\nWe classify the 13 galaxies into three classes based solely on their morphologies;\nsingle emission: showing a single resolved source of H\u03b1 emission, extended emission:\nshowing multiple unresolved or extended components, and multiple emission: having\nmultiple resolved regions of H\u03b1 emission. These classifications are used to discuss\nthe properties of galaxies with like morphologies in the context of different formation\nscenarios.\nThe Clumpy Disk Hypothesis: We investigate the scenario that the classes represent different stages of the clumpy disk models of Elmegreen et al. (2008) simulations\n(EBE08). In these simulations gravitational instabilities result in multiple star-forming\ncomplexes forming under Jeans collapse within a young gas rich disk. As turbulent\nspeeds decrease relative to the rotational speed of the disk the clumps migrate towards the center on a timescale of \u223c 1 Gyr. Finally, the clumps coalesce and form\na slowly rotating pseudo-bulge (Noguchi 1999; Bournaud et al. 2007; Elmegreen et al.\n2008; Dekel et al. 2009; Krumholz & Dekel 2010).\nThe morphology of multiple emission systems is well matched to the early stages\nof clumpy disk formation (t = 175 \u2212 450 Myr) of the EBE08 simulations. The velocity\nof the clumps follows the global velocity structure of the galaxy, consistent with models\n(Immeli et al. 2004b). This is seen in WK0909 06R (Figure 2), where the major axis of\n\n\f4\n\nWisnioski et al.\n\nFigure 2.\nOSIRIS H\u03b1 kinematics of 3 out of 13 galaxies in our sample,\nWK0909 06R is an example of the multiple emission galaxies, WK0912 01R is an\nexample of the extended emission galaxies, and WK1002 42S is an example of the\nsingle emission galaxies. Left: H\u03b1 flux map, middle velocity map from the systemic\nvelocity, right velocity dispersion map. The black crosses mark the peak(s) in H\u03b1\nflux. Velocity and velocity dispersion are measured in km/s.\n\nrotation cuts across multiple clumps revealing no corresponding deviation in the rotation profile. The morphologies of the extended emission galaxies are either consistent\nwith the system being observed at the clump coalescence phase (t = 600 \u2212 800 Myr)\nor the result of projection effects, with some galaxies well fit by disk models. Compact\nsingle emission galaxies have morphologies well matched to the later stage of simulated\nformation when the clumps have collapsed to form a bulge (t = 1000 Myr). The high\ndispersions and masses of these systems are consistent with EBE08 bulges, predicted\nto become slow rotators with high turbulence of \u03c3los \u223c 130 km s\u22121 in the inner regions\nwith M\u2217 > 1010 M\u2299 .\n\n\fClumpology of Starbursts in the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey\n\n5\n\nStar-forming regions within a disk should have similar or consistent metallicities as they are evolving within the same conditions (Immeli et al. 2004a) In a major or minor merger no similar correlation is expected in the metallicities of each\ngalaxy. By integrating the light of each clump the clump metallicities are calculated\nfrom the H\u03b1/[NII] ratio. Metallicities of clumps in multiple emission galaxies, such as\nWK0909 06R (Figure 2) are equal within the errors, as predicted for the early stages of\ndisk fragmentation.\nThe Merger Hypothesis: However, with separations of 3\u201310 kpc the H\u03b1 complexes may be sites of multiple regions of star formation merging from different parent galaxies. Without deep imaging of diffuse continuum light surrounding the H\u03b1\nemission to reveal tidal features characteristic of mergers, we need to utilize kinematic\nquantities to find support for this hypothesis. We analyze here a scenario in which our\nsample form a merger sequence with pre, ongoing, and post mergers. In this scenario\nthe multiple emission galaxies are the initial stages of mergers when star formation in\nseparate galaxies can be spatially differentiated. The extended emission galaxies are\nthe next stage in the sequence representing ongoing merging activity (or pre-mergers\nwith component confusion due to projection effects). The final stage in the proposed\nmerger sequence is the single emission galaxies which represent merger remnants with\nhigh dispersions and star formation rates.\nAlthough some of the galaxies in our sample show indications of ordered rotation\nindicative of disks from their velocity maps, none of the systems show a clear peak\nin velocity dispersion corresponding to the turnover of the velocity distribution as expected for disk galaxies. Although this may be explained by sensitivity effects, the\nlack of a peak in velocity dispersion, a feature observed in IFS studies in both local\n(de Zeeuw et al. 2002) and high redshift (Genzel et al. 2006; F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al.\n2009) disk galaxies, may indicate that we are seeing separate kinematic components\nmerging. In this case, the observed peaks in dispersion may correspond to the centers\nof individual galaxies merging or be a result of shock fronts between merging systems.\nThe majority of IFS results that have been classified as mergers show velocity maps\nwhere the velocity does not vary smoothly across the source but rather show a quick\nturnover within a resolution element or less (Nesvadba et al. 2008; Wright et al. 2009;\nLaw et al. 2009). This step function is not present in the kinematics in our sample.\nFindings: Whilst it is natural to attempt to identify kinematic observations as\ndisks or mergers, this simplified picture of galaxies becomes increasingly fallible at\nhigh-redshift. We are hesitant to split our data as has been done in previous studies\n(disk, merger, dispersion dominated, etc.) on an individual basis as we find that galaxies do not populate homogeneous classes but rather form a heterogeneous sample. In a\nsample of 13 galaxies it is likely a variety of mechanisms are at work, even if disk instability is a dominant mechanism in star formation histories at high redshift, as our data\nsupports, the disks are likely to undergo mergers in their lifetime further complicating\nkinematic interpretations. Future deep optical and infrared imaging will help to clarify the extended morphologies of these systems and assist in discriminating between\nturbulent disks and ongoing major/minor mergers.\nReferences\nAbraham, R.
