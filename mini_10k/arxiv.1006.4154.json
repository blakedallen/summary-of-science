The voltage is induced across a GdIG sample by the\nalignment of the sample's magnetic dipole moments (MDMs) in an applied magnetic field H. All solid-state electron\nEDM experiments rely on the fact that the electron EDM d is collinear with its MDM m, because they are both\nsupposed to be proportional to the spin S; it is supposed that S is the only available 3-vector in the rest frame of\nthe particle. Thus, the interaction of the EDMs and H is only indirect through the alignment of MDMs, i.e., the\nthree-dimensional (3D) spins, in the field H.\nRecently, [2], the Uhlenbeck-Goudsmit hypothesis is generalized in a Lorentz covariant manner using 4D geometric\nquantities; the dipole moment tensor Dab is proportional to the spin four-tensor S ab , Dab = gS S ab , Eq. (9) in [2].\nThe dipole moment vectors da and ma are derived from Dab and the velocity vector of the particle ua , Eq. (2) in [2].\nSimilarly, the usual 4D spin S a , and a new one, the intrinsic angular momentum, spin Z a , are derived from S ab and\nua , Eq. (8) in [2]. Then, Eq. (10) in [2] is obtained as ma = cgS S a , da = gS Z a . Accordingly, the intrinsic MDM ma\nis determined by S a , whereas the intrinsic EDM da is determined by the new spin vector Z a and not, as usual, by\nthe spin S. Both spins, S a and Z a , are equally good physical quantities.\nInstead of an indirect interaction between the applied H and an EDM d through the alignment of 3D spins by the\ninteraction \u2212m(S/S) * B, we propose a direct, Lorentz covariant, interaction between B a and an EDM da .\nInserting the decomposition of F ab (in terms of E a , B a and the velocity vector v a of the observers who measure\nfields), Eq. (1) in [2], and that one of Dab , Eq. (2) in [2], into the interaction term (1/2)Fab Dba , one finds Eq. (3)\nin [2] (it is first reported in [3]). When it is taken that the laboratory frame is the e0 -frame (the frame in which the\nobservers who measure E a and B a are at rest, with the standard basis {e\u03bc } in it), then E 0 = B 0 = 0, and only three\nspatial components E i and B i will remain. Similarly, only in the particle's rest frame, with the standard basis in\nit, d0 = m0 = 0 and only di and mi will remain. Hence, it is not possible that, e.g., in the laboratory frame, both,\nthe fields and the dipole moments have only three spatial components, i.e., as for the usual 3-vectors. (In all EDM\nexperiments the interaction is described in terms of the 3-vectors as E * d and B * m.)\nIn the laboratory frame as the e0 -frame, one can neglect the contributions to Lint , Eq. (3) in [2], from the terms\nwith d0 and m0 ; they are u2 /c2 of the usual terms Ei di or Bi mi . Then, what remains is\nLint = \u2212((Ei di ) + (Bi mi )) \u2212 (1/c2 )\u03b50ijk (Ei mk \u2212 c2 Bi dk )uj .\n\n(1)\n\nWith the usual 3-vectors, it would correspond to Eq. (26) in [2]. But, as stated in [2]: \"... what is essential for\nthe number of components of a vector field is the number of variables on which that vector field depends, i.e., the\ndimension of its domain. Thus, strictly speaking, the time-dependent E(r,t) and B(r,t) cannot be the 3-vectors, since\nthey are defined on the spacetime.\" Furthermore, as noticed in [2]: \"... neither the direction of d nor the direction of\nthe spin S have a well-defined meaning in the 4D spacetime. The only Lorentz-invariant condition on the directions\nof da and S a in the 4D spacetime is da ua = S a ua = 0. This condition does not say that d has to be parallel to the\nspin S.\" Obviously, the same remark holds if d is replaced by m and da by ma . The results from [2] indicate that the\nbasic points of the interpretation of measurements of EDM in [1], i.e., both m and d are parallel to S, are meaningless\nin the manifestly covariant formulation from [2]. This means that the usual formulation with 3-vectors E, B, S, etc.\nIS NOT relativistically correct formulation.\nIt is seen from Eq. (1) that the interaction between B a and a MDM ma is contained in the term \u2212Bi mi .and that\none between B a and an EDM da is contained in the term \u03b50ijk Bi dk uj , which is ua - dependent.\nIn conclusion, according to Eq. (1), a voltage induced across the solid is not caused by the alignment of MDMs in\nan applied field H than by the polarization of the sample due to the interaction \u03b50ijk Bi dk uj . That voltage can give\nsome information about da , because that term contains the EDM da .\nReferences\n[1] B. J. Heidenreich et al., .Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 253004 (2005).\n[2] T. Ivezi\u0107, Phys.
