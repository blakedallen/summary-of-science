For a non-stationary\nblack hole, that is, one undergoing dynamical evolution,\nthe situation is more complicated: the intersection of\nthe event horizon and a given spatial hypersurface may\nbe toroidal instead of spherical [2]; In fact, Siino has\nshown that event horizons may have topology of arbitrary genus [3, 4]. Event horizons with initially-toroidal\ntopologies have been observed in numerical simulations\nof the collapse of rotating star clusters [5, 6].\nA number of theorems restrict the conditions under\nwhich horizons can have toroidal topology; for instance,\nthe torus must close up fast enough so that no light ray\nfrom past null infinity can pass through the torus and\nreach future null infinity [7, 8]. Additionally, it has been\nconjectured that for all toroidal horizons, a new spacetime foliation can be chosen so that the intersection of\nthe horizon with each slice of the foliation has spherical\ntopology [8].\nThe recent ability of numerical relativity to simulate\nthe merger of two black holes (see refs. [9, 10] for recent\nreviews) provides a laboratory for studying the structure\nof event horizons that are far from stationary. Husa and\nWinicour predicted [11] that a brief toroidal phase should\noccur generically in binary black hole mergers, but until\nrecently most numerical investigations of event horizons\nutilized some degree of symmetry. Diener [12] investigated event horizons in non-symmetric black hole collisions, including those of three black holes, but he did not\nhave sufficient numerical resolution to determine whether\na toroidal phase occurs in his simulations. More recently,\nPonce [13] et. al. examined the merger of ring of eight\nblack holes initially at rest and also found no evidence of\na toroidal event horizon.\nIn this paper, we investigate the event horizons from\ntwo numerical simulations run with the SpEC [14] code by\nbuilding on the work presented in the thesis of Michael\nCohen [15]. The first simulation follows two black holes\n\nof (initially) zero spin and equal mass from a quasicircular orbit, through merger and ringdown [16, 17]. The\nsecond simulation is similar, but fully generic: the mass\nratio is 2:1, and the initial spins of magnitude a/M \u2243 0.4\nare not aligned with each other or with the initial orbital\nplane [18]. Table I lists parameters of these two simulations, and also parameters of two previous simulations\nfor which the detailed shape of the event horizon was\ndiscussed in earlier works [19, 20].\nFor all of these simulations, we find the event horizon\nby the method described in Ref. [19]: we choose a set of\noutgoing null geodesics that lie on the apparent horizon\nof the remnant black hole at the end of the simulation\nwhen the spacetime is nearly stationary, and we integrate\nthese geodesics backwards in time. These geodesics exponentially converge onto the event horizon, so we will refer\nto them as generators of the horizon even though they are\nonly (very good) approximations to the true generators.\nIt is important to note that the event horizon is only\na subset of the surface generated by these generators.\nUnder subsequent evolution backwards in time, some of\nthe generators leave the horizon at points where they\nmeet other generators[21, 22]. These meeting points have\nbeen studied extensively [6, 11, 23] and can be separated\ninto two types: caustics, at which neighboring generators focus and converge, and crossover points, at which\nnon-neighboring generators cross. Much of the work in\nstudying the structure of the event horizon in numerical\nsimulations involves identifying the crossover and caustic\npoints, so as to determine when the generators are on or\noff the horizon. In this work we make an effort to clarify the structure of event horizon caustics and crossovers\nfor the cases of spatial slices with and without a toroidal\nevent horizon surface.\nOf course, any numerical study of event horizons is\nlimited by several different sources of numerical error.\nConsequently, the identification of caustic and crossover\npoints must be carefully analyzed to ensure that one's\nconclusions are not tainted by discretization errors. Discretization error could arise from, for example, both the\n\n\f2\n2\n2\n~A /MA\n~B /MB\nII.

Accordingly, one important goal\nof this work is to investigate whether our conclusions are\nrobust when we change the (relatively high) spatial and\ntemporal resolution of our event horizons.\nWe note that it is not always easy to visualize the event\nhorizon's topological structure from the two-dimensional\nscreenshots we can include in this work. Therefore, we\nmake our event horizon data for the generic merger, Run\n2 from Table I, available online for the reader to explore\nat: www.black-holes.org/onToroidalHorizonsData.html.\nIncluded are detailed instructions on how to visualize and\ncompare the event horizon data for different resolutions\nusing freely available 3D visualization software [24]. Also\nincluded there are saved state and camera view files allowing the reader to jump to the views displayed in this\nwork, providing the ability for the reader to see the event\nhorizons as they are featured in this paper's figures [25].\nThe organization of this paper is as follows: In Section II we present modifications to our event-horizon\nfinder [19] that allow us to detect crossover points, i.e.\nintersections of non-neighboring horizon generators. In\nSection III we apply this method to find the event horizon of two binary black hole simulations in which the\nblack holes merge after inspiraling from an initially quasicircular orbit. We find that the merged horizon has\nspherical topology to the limit of our numerical accuracy. In Section IV we review the structure of crossover\npoints and caustics in binary black hole collisions. We\nshow how toroidal horizon cross sections are possible in\nblack hole collisions without symmetry, and how the existence of toroidal cross sections depends on the choice\nof time slicing. In Section V we identify the crossover\npoints and caustics of the horizon generators for our numerical simulations, and show that they are consistent\nwith expectations for generic binary black hole mergers.\nIn particular, we infer that there should exist a different\nslicing of our numerical spacetime such that a toroidal\nhorizon is present for a finite coordinate time. We summarize our findings and conclude in Section VI.\n\npoints can be classified into two types: caustics, which\noccur when neighboring generators focus and converge,\nand crossovers, which occur when non-neighboring generators cross. The set of crossover points generically forms\na two-dimensional subset of the three-dimensional event\nhorizon hypersurface, (see Figure 3 right panel), and the\nset of caustics generically forms the boundary of the set\nof crossovers [11, 23].\nIn previous applications of our event-horizon finder it\nsufficed to search only for caustics and not for crossover\npoints. Ref. [19] treated only axisymmetric head-on\nblack hole collisions, for which all crossovers are also\ncaustics (cf. Run 3 of Table I). Interestingly, we found\nthat for spinning, head-on black hole collisions (cf. Run 4\nof Table I) [20], despite the lack of pure axisymmetry, the\nset of crossover points is also composed entirely of caustics. However, for finding the event horizon of a binary\nblack hole system that inspirals and merges, we find it is\nnecessary to develop a technique for detecting crossover\npoints.\nOn any given spacelike slice, the set of generators forms\na smooth, closed two-dimensional surface that may selfintersect (at crossover points and/or caustics). We detect\ncaustics by monitoring the local area element on this surface [19]; the area element vanishes at caustics. In order\nto detect crossover points, we model this surface as a set\nof triangles, and we check whether each generator has\npassed through each triangle between the current and\nthe previous time step.\nTo define these triangles, we note that the surface of\ngenerators can be mapped to a two-sphere with standard\npolar coordinates u \u2208 [0, \u03c0], v \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0) in such a way so\nthat each generator is tied to a specific value of u and v\nfor all time. The generators are placed on a grid in (u, v)\nspace, and the triangles are defined on this grid. Thus the\nproperty \"neighbor-ness\" (i.e. knowing which geodesics\nare to the left/right/above/below any given geodesic) is\nmaintained throughout the simulation. We choose the\ngrid points in (u, v) space to be the collocation points of a\npseudospectral expansion in spherical harmonics of order\nL, and we use this L to describe the numerical resolution\nof the event horizon finder. There are no geodesics at\nthe poles u = 0 and u = \u03c0, so for the purpose of defining\ntriangles we place artificial points there (the simulation\ncoordinates x, y, z of such a pole point are defined as the\nmean of the x, y, z coordinates of the nearest neighboring geodesics). Thus each triangle near the pole is formed\nfrom the artificial pole point plus two points that represent geodesics. The number of geodesics in a surface of\nresolution L is 2(L + 1)2 , and the number of triangles in\nthe surface is 4(L + 1)2 . The algorithm compares every\ntriangle with every geodesic point, to determine whether\nthe geodesic has passed through that triangle between the\n\n\f3\n\nn1\n\nq1\n\na1\n\nwhere D is a constant, and nP is the normal of the plane.\nNow, D(t) = p(t) * n(t), a cubic equation, so our geodesic\na(t) and the triangle {p, q, r}(t) are coplanar at times t\nthat satisfy the equation\n\nr1\nq\n\np(t) * n(t) \u2212 a(t) * n(t) = n(t) * (p(t) \u2212 a(t)) = 0.\n\nr\n\np1\np\n\nq0\nn0\nr0\n\np0\n\na0\n\nFIG. 1: Crossover-detection algorithm illustrated by a\ngeodesic crossing a moving triangle. Points p0 , q0 , and r0\nform the triangle at time t0 , and points p1 , q1 , and r1 form\nthe triangle at time t1 . Likewise points a0 and a1 represent\nthe geodesic at times t0 and t1 .\n\ncurrent and previous time step. Therefore, if the number\nof geodesics on the horizon is N , the number of triangles\nis 2N , and the computational cost of the algorithm scales\nas O(N 2 ).\nDetermining whether the point has passed through\nthe triangle proceeds as follows (see Figure 1 for a diagram): Suppose that the positions of the three geodesics\nthat comprise the vertexes of the triangle at time t0 are\np0 , q0 , r0 , and the position of the potentially intersecting\ngeodesic is a0 . At time t1 , one time step later, these positions are p1 , q1 , r1 and a1 . We assume that the geodesics\nmove linearly in space during the short interval between\ntime t0 and t1 . Thus p(t) = p0 + t(p1 \u2212 p0 ) = p0 + tp\u0304,\nand similarly for q, p and a. We now define the normal\nof the triangle at time t0\nn0 = (q0 \u2212 p0 ) \u00d7 (r0 \u2212 p0 ),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere we have assumed that the orientation of the triangle points is anti-clockwise. As a function of time, the\nnormal is\nn(t) = (q(t) \u2212 p(t)) \u00d7 (r(t) \u2212 p(t))\n= (q0 \u2212 p0 + t(q\u0304 \u2212 p\u0304)) \u00d7 (r0 \u2212 p0 + t(r\u0304 \u2212 p\u0304))\n= (q0 \u2212 p0 ) \u00d7 (r0 \u2212 p0 ) + t[(q\u0304 \u2212 p\u0304) \u00d7 (r0 \u2212 p0 ) +\n(q0 \u2212 p0 ) \u00d7 (r\u0304 \u2212 p\u0304)] + t2 (q\u0304 \u2212 p\u0304) \u00d7 (r\u0304 \u2212 p\u0304). (2)\nSince p0 , q0 , r0 , p\u0304, q\u0304, r\u0304 are known quantities, we can write\nEquation 2 as\nn(t) = n0 + \u03b1t + \u03b2t2 .\n\n(3)\n\nNow, any given plane P has the property that\n\u2200i \u2208 P,\n\ni * nP = D,\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\nEquation 5 is a cubic with algebraic roots, which can\nbe solved for analytically. For every root found between\nt0 < t \u2264 t1 , it is a simple matter to check whether a(troot )\nis within the triangle {p, q, r}(troot ), rather than merely\nbeing co-planar.\nThere are a few special cases to be checked, such as\nensuring that the geodesic being tested for intersection\nis not one of the geodesics that make up the triangle,\nor cases for which the cubic equation is degenerate, but\nthe algorithm itself is quite robust and effective. Although the algorithm is, as mentioned above, O(N 2 ),\nthe expense of the algorithm is mitigated by two factors.\nFirstly, since the algorithm involves analytically solving\nan at most cubic equation, the run time of each individual instance is very small, on the order of microseconds.\nSecondly, the looping condition is sufficiently simple that\nit can be parallelized over multiple cores without any significant CPU overhead. In practice, with typical resolutions of between 30, 000 & 60, 000 geodesics, the run time\nis not prohibitive.\nIII. EVENT HORIZONS FROM NUMERICAL\nSIMULATIONS OF BINARY BLACK HOLE\nMERGERS\n\nHusa and Winicour [11] posit that mergers of binary\nblack holes in a non-axisymmetric configuration generically result in an intermediate toroidal state of the event\nhorizon. Previously (cf. Runs 3 and 4 of Table I) we\nhave found that merger occurs at a single point in not\nonly the axisymmetric head-on merger [19], but also the\nhead-on spinning merger [20] (where axisymmetry is broken). Therefore, we were strongly motivated to determine the topological behavior of the event horizon for\nmergers of black holes that inspirals from an initially\nquasicircular orbit, where axisymmetry is broken in no\nuncertain terms.\nFigure 2 shows the event horizons from two numerical\nsimulations of binary black hole coalescence, at the time\nof merger. In the top panel, the two black holes start in\na quasicircular orbit, and have equal masses and initially\nzero spins; details of this simulation were published in\nRef. [16]. The bottom panel shows a fully generic situation: again the black holes start in a quasicircular orbit,\nbut the mass ratio is 2:1, and the initial spins have magnitude a/M \u2243 0.4 and are not aligned with each other\nor with the initial orbital plane. This simulation is \"case\nF\" of Ref. [18]. For both of these simulations, we find\nthe generators of the event horizon using the \"geodesic\nmethod\" of [19]. We integrate generators backwards in\ntime, and when we find that generators leave the event\n\n\f4\nIV. TOPOLOGICAL STRUCTURE OF THE\nEVENT HORIZON FOR INSPIRALING AND\nMERGING BLACK HOLES\n\nFIG. 2: Color online. Slices through the event horizon at\nthe exact point of merger to within numerical accuracy. Upper panel: Equal-mass non-spinning 16-orbit inspiral, Run\n1 of Table I, at t/M = 3902.897; the point of merger is\ntmerger /M = 3902.897 \u00b1 0.006. Here M is the sum of the\nADM masses. Lower panel: Generic merger, Run 2 of Table I, at t/M = 117.145; the point of merger is tmerger /M =\n117.145 \u00b1 0.005. The error estimates come from the time resolution of our event horizon finder (i.e. our EH finder time\nstep is \u223c 0.005M ); note that the merger occurs at the same\ntime (within this error bound) for both medium and high resolutions of the numerical relativity simulations. At earlier\ntimes the two black hole horizons are disjoint. No toroids are\nevident in the limit of our accuracy.\n\nhorizon, either through caustics (as determined by the\nvanishing of the local area element of the surface of generators [19]) or through crossover points (as determined\nby the method described in Section II) we flag them as\nhaving left the horizon. Figure 2 plots only those generators that are on the horizon at the time of merger. In\nboth the equal-mass and generic cases, our results show\nthat the event horizons merge at a point, with no intermediate toroidal phase to the limit of our numerical\naccuracy.\n\nIn order to understand why no toroidal intermediate\nstage is found in our simulations, we need to further understand the topological structure of the event horizon\nnull hypersurface in the case of a binary inspiral and\nmerger. In [11], Husa and Winicour consider two sets\nof points. One set, labeled C, is the set of all caustic\npoints in the spacetime where neighboring event horizon geodesics cross. The other set of points, X , is the\nset of all crossover points in the spacetime, where nonneighboring event horizon geodesics cross. They show\nthat the set of points X is an open 2-surface on the event\nhorizon null hypersurface N , and that this set is bounded\nby the caustic set C. They further show that the behavior\nof this 2-surface of caustic/crossover points is governed\nby the topology of the merger. In an axisymmetric prolate merger (such as our headon case), the 2-surface is\nreduced by the symmetry, resulting in the single boundary line of caustic points we see as being the \"inseam\"\nof the \"pair of pants,\" as shown in the left panel of Figure 3. In the non-axisymmetric case, the set of caustic\nand crossover points is a 2-surface on the event horizon,\nas shown in the case of a binary black hole inspiral in the\nright panel of Figure 3 (where we show the merger in a\ncorotating frame).\nThe question of whether toroidal horizons can be found\nin the intermediate stages of binary black hole merger can\nbe answered by considering the various ways in which\nthese \"pair of pants\" diagrams can be sliced. The fact\nthat the set caustic/crossover points C \u222a X is a spacelike\n2-surface on a non-axisymmetric event horizon hypersurface (and, for an axisymmetric case, the line of points C\nis a spacelike line) provides some freedom in the allowed\nspacelike slicings of this surface.\nLet us first consider whether a nontrivial topology\nmight be obtained in the axisymmetric case. In order\nto do so, we need to consider how such a slice may be\nconstructed. Clearly, if we were to construct \"horizontal\"\nspatial slices of the null hypersurface in the left panel of\nFigure 3, we would produce a slicing in which the merger\noccurred at a point. However, we can attempt to construct slices in which the lapse is somewhat retarded near\nthe \"crotch.\" In Figure 4 we examine a 2-dimensional\nslice in {t, y} through the center of the hypersurface. It\nis clear that if we choose a central point for the slice before the merger of the black holes, we cannot extend a\nspacelike slice from this central point in either the x or y\ndirections in such a way as to encounter the black holes.\nOnly in the z direction can we encounter the black holes.\nThis changes however, when we consider the nonaxisymmetric case. In this case, the x and y directions\nare different, as shown in the right panel of Figure 3. In\nFigure 5 we show a {t, y} 2-slice of the event horizon. The\nevent horizon is spacelike both at C, and along the line\nX . Thus, given a point P below the \"crotch\" of the event\n\n\f5\n\n!\nt\n\n!\n\nt\n\n\"\nz\ny\n\n!\n\nz\ny\n\nFIG. 3: Diagrams of the event horizon null hypersurface in axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric mergers. The merger is along\nthe z-axis. In both panels, the regions C \u222a X are spacelike. Left panel: In the axisymmetric case, the caustic/crossover set\nis reduced to a single line of caustic points, the \"inseam\" of the \"pair of pants,\" labeled C. The x direction is suppressed but,\nsince the x and y directions are identical for axisymmetry, the diagram would be unchanged if we were to suppress y in favor\nof x. Right panel: In the non-axisymmetric case, such as an inspiral (where we have \"unwound\" the legs of the \"pair of\npants\" by going to a corotating frame), the set of crossover points X is two-dimensional, bounded on both sides by \"inseams\"\nC. Unlike the axisymmetric case, here the x and y directions are not identical. Since the caustic/crossover set of points is a\n2-surface, the diagram we would obtain by suppressing y in favor of x would look identical to the left panel, except that the\nsingle \"inseam\" would be composed of crossover points.\n\nt\nt\n\nN\nx,y\nS1\ny\n\n!\nt\nz\n\nC1\n0\n\n0\n1\n0\n1\n00000000000000000000000000\n11111111111111111111111111\n0\n1\n\ny\n\nP\n\nS0\n\nFIG. 4: A 2-dimensional slice through the event horizon null hypersurface in an axisymmetric merger. The horizontal direction\nin the right panel could be either x or y. We attempt to construct a slice S1 in x (or y) from point P that intersects the black\nhole. This slice is clearly not spacelike. Since N is spacelike only at C, only a slice such as S0 that does not intersect the black\nhole can be both spacelike and pass through P.\n\nhorizon, we can construct three distinct slices, each with\ndifferent behavior. Slice S0 does not encounter the event\nhorizon at all in the y direction. Slice S1 encounters the\nevent horizon four times: twice in the null region, and\ntwice in the spacelike region. Finally, slice S2 encounters the event horizon four times in the spacelike region.\nNote that in the x direction, the slice through the event\n\nhorizon is identical to slice S0 of Figure 4 (except that\nthe \"inseam\" is part of the crossover set X instead of the\ncaustic set C). Therefore, if we slice our spacetime using\nslices S1 or S2 , our slice encounters the event horizon four\ntimes in the z and y directions, and not at all in the x\ndirection. This is precisely a toroidal intermediate stage.\nSuch slices can be seen in three dimensions {t, y, z} in\n\n\f6\nt\n\nt\nN\ny\n\ny\n\n\"\n\n!\n\nt\n\n!\n\nC\n\n00\n11\n\nz\n\nX\nP\n\ny\n\nS1\n\nC\n\n00\n11\n\nS0\nS2\n\nFIG. 5: A 2-dimensional slice through the event horizon null hypersurface in a non-axisymmetric merger. Unlike the previous\nfigure, the horizontal direction in the right panel is not interchangeable between x and y. We construct three slices S0 , S1 , S2\nfrom the starting point P. These slices intersect the event horizon in different ways. Since C \u222a X is spacelike, all these slices\nare spacelike. Although exaggerated for effect, the tangent to X in the t-y plane becomes null at C (see [6]).\n\nFigure 6.\nWe now consider what the event horizon looks like in\nthree spatial dimensions {x, y, z} on each of the slices S0 ,\nS1 , or S2 of Figures 5 and 6. The top panel of Figure 7\nshows the intersection of the event horizon with the slice\nS0 . Compare with Figure 6, which shows the same slice\nin the dimensions {t, y, z}. The slice S0 does not encounter the event horizon in the x \u2212 y plane; this plane\nlies between the two black holes. On each black hole, the\nslice S0 encounters the two-dimensional crossover set X\nalong a one-dimensional curve, and this curve is bounded\nby two caustic points from the set C.\nIn contrast, the intersection of the event horizon with\nthe slice S1 is shown in the middle panel of Figure 7.\nCompare with Figure 6, which shows the same slice in\nthe dimensions {t, y, z}. This is a toroidal cross section\nof the horizon. Slice S1 intersects the event horizon four\ntimes along the y axis: the outer two points are in the\nnull region of the horizon N and the inner two are in the\nspacelike crossover set X . Note that the inner edge of the\ntorus is made up entirely of crossover points from the set\nX and does not include caustic points nor points in the\nset N . The existence of an isolated set of crossovers that\ncannot be connected to caustics is a key signature of a\ntoroidal horizon.\nThe bottom panel of Figure 7 shows the intersection\nof the event horizon with the slice S2 , which is shown\nin the {t, y} directions in Figure 5. This slice also produces a torus. Slice S2 intersects the event horizon four\ntimes along the y axis, and each of these intersections is\na crossover point in X . As was the case for slice S1 , the\ninner edge of the torus for slice S2 also consists entirely\nof crossover points. The outer edge of the event horizon intersects the two-dimensional crossover set X along\ntwo one-dimensional curves, and each of these curves is\n\nbounded by caustic points on each end.\nIt is important to note another distinction between the\nbehavior of slices S1 and S2 in Figures 5 and 7. When\na slice intersects the event horizon at a point that is a\nmember of C \u222a X , that point is the point where two generators of the event horizon pass through each other as\nthey merge onto the event horizon. Consequently, that\npoint is not a smooth part of the event horizon. If instead the slice intersects the event horizon at a point not\nin C \u222a X , that point is a smooth part of the event horizon. Therefore, S1 corresponds to a toroidal intermediate\nstage where the torus has a non-smooth (i.e. sharp) inner edge and a smooth outer edge, and S2 corresponds\nto a stage where both the outside and the inside of the\ntorus are sharp-edged. There also exists the possibility\nof a slice that looks like S1 in the positive y direction and\nlooks like S2 in the negative y direction or vice versa; on\nsuch a slice the outer edge of the torus will be sharp on\none side and smooth on the other.\n\nV.\n\nTOPOLOGICAL STRUCTURE OF\nSIMULATED EVENT HORIZONS\n\nHaving shown how an appropriate choice of slicing\nyield spatial slices in which the event horizon is toroidal,\nwe now hope to convince the reader that, up to the limit\nof our numerical resolution, we see no signs of a toroidal\nevent horizon in the slicing of our simulations. In greater\ngenerality, we would like to answer the following question:\nWhat is the structure of caustic and crossover points for\nthe simulations we have performed, and how do those\nresults relate to the structure discussed in the previous\nsection?\nWe can use Figure 6 to predict the structure of caustic\n\n\f7\n\nS0\n#&\n\n$\n\nS1\n\n#%\n!\n\nt\n\n\"\n\n!\n\nz\ny\n\nFIG. 6: A 3-dimensional representation of slices S0 and S1\nfrom Figure 5. Here we see the continuation of each slice in\nthe z direction. The event horizon is toroidal on slice S1 ; the\ncenter of the torus is P. The toroidal region is the part of S1\nthat has dipped through the crossover region X .\n\nS2\nY\n\nZ\nand crossover points for an early slice through the event\nhorizon of a non-axisymmetric merger. Unlike the axisymmetric case, where all geodesics merge onto the event\nhorizon at a point, an early slice of the non-axisymmetric\nmerger, say slice S0 in Figure 6, should show each black\nhole with a linear cusp on its surface, through which\ngeodesics merge onto the horizon. The cusp should be\ncomposed of crossover points, except that the boundaries\nof the cusp should be caustic points. At a later time, the\ntwo black holes will merge, and whether or not a torus\nis formed depends on how the slice intersects the set of\ncaustics and crossovers, as seen in Figure 7.\nTo clarify let us first state a precise condition for the\npresence or absence of a toroidal event horizon: A slice\nwithout a toroidal event horizon has the following property: For every crossover point on the horizon, there exists a path from that crossover point to a caustic point,\nsuch that the path passes through only crossover points\n(cf. Figure 7). For a slice with a toroidal event horizon,\nthere exist crossover points on the horizon that are disconnected from all caustics, in the sense that no path can\nbe drawn along crossovers that reaches a caustic. For example, in slices S1 and S2 of Figure 7, the crossover points\non the inner edge of the torus are disconnected from all\ncaustics.\nA slicing of spacetime where the event horizon is never\ntoroidal will appear like slice S0 at early times. Approaching merger, the two disjoint crossover sets will extend into \"duck bill\" shapes and then meet at a point,\nforming an \"X\" shape at the exact point of merger. After merger, the crossover set will then disconnect and will\nlook like the outer edges of the horizon of slice S2 (with\nno torus in the middle). At even later times, each dis-\n\nFIG. 7: Color online. Cartoon illustrations of spatial slices\nS0 , S1 , and S2 of Figures 5 and 6. Null generators currently on\nthe horizon are in red; linear sets of crossovers merging onto\nthe horizon are indicated by black lines, and the location of\ncaustic points are denoted by blue Xs.\n\njoint crossover set on the outer edge of the horizon will\nshrink to a single caustic point and then disappear.\nA slicing of spacetime in which the event horizon is\ntoroidal will also look like slice S0 at early times. But\nat times approaching merger, the disjoint crossover sets\nwill meet at two (or more) points instead of one. If these\nmeeting points are the caustics, then just after merger\nthese caustics will disappear, leaving a ring of crossovers,\nand the horizon will look like slice S1 of Figure 7. If instead these meeting points are crossover points, then the\ncrossover set will form a double \"X\" shape at merger,\nand after merger, the crossovers in the middle will form\na ring, and the horizon will look like slice S2 of Figure 7.\nIn this latter case, each disjoint crossover set on the outer\nedge of the horizon will eventually shrink to a single caustic point and then disappear. Furthermore, the central\nring of crossovers will eventually shrink to a single point\nand disappear. If the disappearance of the crossovers on\nthe horizon edge occurs before the disappearance of the\ncentral ring of crossovers, then for some time the horizon\nwill look like slice S1 of Figure 7.\nComparing these predictions with the results of a simulation of finite numerical resolution requires care, since\nsingle points (such as the point of merger or the single\ncaustic points that bound the crossover sets) cannot be\nfound with infinite precision. We will discuss these limi-\n\n\f8\n\nFIG. 8: Color online. A snapshot of the geodesics being followed by the event horizon finder at time t/M =\ntmerger /M \u2212 0.067, for the equal-mass inspiral. The small\ndots are geodesics currently on the event horizon. The larger\npoints, either crosses or circles, represent geodesics in the process of merging onto the event horizon. Crosses represent\npoints merging through caustic points, while circles represent\npoints merging through crossovers. In this slice, the cusp on\nthe black hole is linear, and composed of crossover points with\ncaustics at the end points.\n\ntations in the concluding paragraphs of this section. Let\nus now analyze the two numerical simulations studied\nhere in detail.\nA.\n\nEqual-mass non-spinning merger\n\nIn Figures 8\u201310,1 we examine our simulation of the\ncoalescence of two equal-mass non-spinning black holes.\nThis simulation clearly displays the characteristics of a\nnon-axisymmetric merger: the black holes do indeed have\nlinear cusps on their surfaces, and we find caustic points\noccuring at the edges of the cusps.\nFigure 8 shows generators before the point of merger.\nAt this time, our slicing is consistent with slices parallel to S0 in Figure 5. These slices correspond to late\nenough times that they have encountered the horizon's\nlinear cusps but early enough times that they have not\nyet encountered points C in Figure 5. The event horizon slices show a \"bridge\" extending partway between\nthe black holes, with cusps along each side. Each cusp\nis a line of crossover points on one of the black holes,\nanchored at each end by a caustic point.\nAt the precise point of merger (Figure 9) our slicing\nremains consistent with slices parallel to S0 in Figure 5.\nIn this figure, slices parallel to S0 encounter the crossover\n\n1\n\nThe axes in all snapshots are not the same as the axes denoted\nin Figures 3\u20137. They correspond to the coordinate axes of the\nbinary black hole merger simulations and illustrate the relative\ncamera angle between snapshots.\n\nFIG. 9: Color online. A snapshot of the geodesics being followed by the event horizon finder at time t/M = tmerger /M ,\nthe exact point of merger (to within numerical error) in the\nequal-mass inspiral simulation. Labels are the same as in Figure 8. Although finding the exact point of merger is difficult\ngiven limited numerical time accuracy, we can extrapolate the\n\"X\" shape of the cusps to see that the merger point is clearly\na crossover point.\n\nregion at slightly earlier times than they encounter the\ncaustic lines. Therefore, at merger, the slice will intersect the horizon at one point (a crossover point) in the\ny direction, and this point is where the linear cusps on\nthe individual black holes meet. Consequently, the slice\nat the point of merger is expected to have a rough \"X\"\nshape of crossover points, meeting at the merger point,\nand anchored at the edges of the black hole cusps by\ncaustic points. In Figure 9, we see that this is indeed the\ncase. Note that if our slicing were similar to slice S1 in\nFigure 5 rather than slice S0 , the linear cusps of the individual black holes would meet at two points rather than\none, and these two points would be the caustic points\nat the boundary of the cusps. Similarly, if our slicing\nwere similar to slice S2 in Figure 5, the cusps on the individual black holes would again meet at two points, and\nthese would be crossover points. According to Figure 5,\npresumably there should exist slicings in which the two\nblack holes would first touch at multiple points and form\nhorizons of arbitrary genus.\nAfter merger, the \"X\" shape of the merger has disconnected, resulting in two line segments of crossover points\nstill bounded by caustics. This is clearly visible in Figure 10.\nNote that in Figures 8\u201310, we sometimes find multiple caustic points at the edge of the crossover set, rather\nthan a single caustic point; this appears to be an effect of\nthe finite tolerance of the algorithm that we use to identify caustic points. Similarly, we sometimes find caustic\npoints that are slightly outside the crossover set, as in\nFigure 10. This too appears to be a finite-resolution effect. For the generic run below, we will present horizon\nfigures computed with different number of geodesics in\norder to better understand this effect.\n\n\f9\n\nFIG. 10: Color online. A snapshot of the geodesics being followed by the event horizon finder at time t/M =\ntmerger /M + 0.039, shortly after merger, for the equal-mass\ninspiral. Labels are the same as in Figure 8. The \"bridge\"\nbetween the two black holes has two lines of merger points\nrunning on either side of it, with the majority being crossover\npoints anchored by caustics at either end.\n\nB.\n\n2:1 mass ratio with 'randomly' oriented spins\n\nHere we examine in detail the topological structure of\na generic binary black hole merger, Run 2 of Table I.\nAs noted earlier, this simulation corresponds to \"case F\"\nof Ref. [18]. We use the term 'generic' to highlight the\nfact that this simulation lacks degeneracies in the parameter space of possible binary black hole mergers. While\nthe equal-mass non-spinning simulation is symmetric in\nthe masses and spin parameters of the black hole, and\ntherefore has a few spatial symmetries, this generic simulation possesses no such symmetries. Even though the\nKerr parameter a/M of both holes is the same, their spin\nangular momenta differ by a factor of 4 due to their mass\ndifference.\nThe lack of symmetries for the generic binary black\nhole configuration make it more difficult to detect or exclude the presence of a torus. To see this, consider one of\nthe symmetries of the equal-mass merger: a rotation by\n\u03c0 about the direction of the orbital angular momentum.\nBecause of this symmetry, the horizon finder needs to use\nonly half the number of geodesics that would be required\nfor a generic run: for every geodesic that is integrated\nbackwards in time, another geodesic (with a position rotated by \u03c0 along the direction of the orbital angular momentum) is effectively obtained 'for free'. Conversely, for\na run without symmetries, it is necessary to use far more\ngeodesics in the event horizon finder.\nWe will now examine the event horizon of the 'generic'\nmerger at several spacetime locations that are important\nto the topological structure of the event horizon. Again,\ncontrast this to the equal-mass merger, where there is\nonly one spacetime region of interest to the topology of\nthe horizon: the region and location where the common\nevent horizon is first formed, and the associated cusp on\n\nthe individual horizons.\nFor each of these spacetime locations we have investigated the consistency of the observed topological structure for several different numerical resolutions; specifically, we have run our event horizon finder using different\nspatial and temporal resolutions for the 2 + 1 event horizon hypersurface, as well as on two of the different resolutions used to evolve the 3 + 1 generic binary black hole\nmerger simulation. We find no qualitative differences between the resolutions. In particular, though there appear\nto be features where a crossover point exists beyond the\nboundary or 'anchor' of a caustic, these features are not\nconvergent with resolution. That is, upon going from\na lower to higher resolution, it is possible to find an\n'anchoring' caustic point for the apparently anomalous\ncrossover. See Figure 12 for a clear demonstration of this\nphenomenon.\nIn the following sections, we examine the effect of two\ndifferent spatial resolutions of our EH finder using a fine\ntime resolution with a \u2206t of 0.005M \u2217: one resolution\nwith 2(119 + 1)2 geodesics (L = 119), and a higher spatial resolution using 2(191 + 1)2 geodesics (L = 191).\nHere M \u2217 is nearly the total mass of the black holes on\nour evolution grid, M ; M \u2217 = M/1.06157 where M is\nthe the sum of the Christodoulou masses of the black\nholes; we use this notation here as all detailed event\nhorizon calculations are done before scaling with the\nChristodoulou masses. Though we do not show them\nhere, the results from the event horizon finding using a\ndifferent time step, and from using a different background\nsimulation resolution can be found online at www.blackholes.org/onToroidalHorizonsData.html. Also included\nat that location are detailed instructions on how to visualize the data in the same way in which we present it in\nthis paper [25].\n\n1.\n\nPre-merger: t = 124.200M \u2217\n\nFirst, we examine the structure of the cusps on each\nblack hole's individual event horizons at a time before\nmerger2 . Figure 11 displays a screenshot of this for two\nspatial resolutions used, focusing on the cusp on the\nlarger black hole. Note that the resolution displayed\nhere is much higher than in the equal-mass non-spinning\ncase, and that we need to plot a much smaller region\nthan in Figures 8\u201310 in order to visualize the structure\nof the cusp. Unfortunately, the topological structure of\nthe event horizon is not as clearly discernible as in the\nequal-mass non-spinning case. A close examination of\nthe data in 3D using the free visualization software ParaView [24] reveals that there do not appear to be any 'isolated sets' of crossovers, i.e. crossovers not anchored by\n\n2\n\nWhere merger is defined by the earliest time for which there is a\ncommon event horizon\n\n\f10\n\nFIG. 12: Color online.

Current generators are shown as red points,\nand generators that are in the process of merging onto the\nevent horizon are shown either as blue crosses (caustics), or\nlarger black dots (crossovers).

The lower panels\nare successive enlargements of the upper panels, focusing on\nthe cusp near the larger black hole.\n\ncaustics. It is very difficult to make this clear using static\nscreenshots in a standard article, and so we have made\nthe visualization data available publicly for inspection at\nwww.black-holes.org/onToroidalHorizonsData.html, and\nencourage the curious reader to view the cusp in 3D [25].\nFigure 12 displays the cusp on the smaller black hole\nat the same time. Here, one can clearly see an example\nof the limits of our current method of discretization of\nthe event horizon surface: while we cannot see proper\n'anchoring' caustics using a resolution of L = 119 (left),\nwe find the expected 'anchoring' caustics using higher\nresolution (L = 191, right). To the limit of the 2 + 1\nresolution of our event horizon surface, we find only one\nconnected set of crossovers on each black hole near their\nrespective cusps.\n\nMerger: t = 124.355M \u2217\n\nOur second time of interest occurs at the merger of\nthe individual event horizons. Figure 13 illustrates the\nmerger by showing screenshots of the coalescing bridge at\nthree consecutive time steps. At merger, the black points\nindicating crossovers appear to form a \"fat X\" with finite width at the center, however this is likely a limitation of our finite temporal resolution; crossover points\ncan only be flagged as as such if they join the horizon\nsometime between two time steps. In the limit of infinite spatial and temporal resolution, we would expect the\nsame merger behavior as in the equal-mass non-spinning\nmerger; i.e., the crossovers will be topologically one dimensional and form an \"X\" shape at merger (albeit a\nhorizontally squished \"X\"). As in the equal-mass case,\nthe point of merger occurs at a crossover.\n\n3.\n\nPost-merger: t = 124.400M \u2217\n\nFinally, we focus at a time after merger: when the\nfinal geodesics join horizon (or, in the backwards-intime language of event horizon finding, when the first\ngeodesics leave the horizon). Figure 14 shows the\ncommon bridge between horizons, along with two linear\ncusps anchored by caustics. The asymmetry of the\nsimulation is clear here: the cusp to the right of the\nbridge is closing faster than the cusp on the left. The\ncusp on the left is closing in the direction along the\nbridge because caustics on either side are approaching\neach other, and it is closing in the transverse direction\n\n\f11\n\nt=124.355M*\n\nt=124.350M*\n\nt=124.355M*\n\nt=124.360M*\n\nFIG. 13: Color online.

The left side of each frame\ndisplays resolution L = 119, and the right side of each frame shows resolution L = 191.\n\nbecause the locus of crossovers is shrinking and moving\nout from the center of the bridge. As we follow this\npicture further in time, the cusp on the right displays\nthe same qualitative behavior.\n\nC.\n\nDiscussion on the numerical analysis of\ntopological features\n\nFigures 11\u201314 illustrate why it is difficult to formulate\na precise numerical condition that tells us the scale to\nwhich we can exclude the presence of a toroidal structure; in the generic case, it is difficult at times to say\nthat we have even identified all connected components of\nthe set of crossovers and caustics visually and qualitatively. In particular, though the distribution of geodesics\nis well spaced on the spherical apparent horizon at late\ntimes (which serves as the initial data for our event horizon finder), this does not ensure a uniform distribution\nof geodesics on the event horizon surface at earlier times.\nThus, as one can see in Figure 14, the crossover points are\nnot uniformly distributed along the line of the cusp. How\ndo we know these crossover points are of the same connected component? Remember, if the crossover points in\nthis region are members of at least two distinct connected\ncomponents, and there are no \"anchoring\" caustic points\nin their neighborhood, it would indicate the presence of a\ntoroidal event horizon! Runs at different resolutions indicate that our visual and qualitative identification of the\ncrossover and caustic structure is consistent with a sin-\n\ngle linear cusp, but the structure is still only resolved up\nto the largest separation of crossover points in the cusp.\nWe note that the implementation of adaptive geodesic\nplacement in our event horizon finder is likely necessary\nto resolve these sorts of issues. We therefore choose to\npostpone the issue of a quantitative and precise bound\non the scale to which we can exclude a toroidal event\nhorizon to future work.\nIt is clear, however, from these results that our simulation is consistent with the topological structure discussed\nby Husa and Winicour in [11], and outlined in Section IV\nabove. Our slicing corresponds to slices parallel to S0\nin Figures 4\u20136 through the structure of the event horizon, but this does not preclude the possibility of other\nspacelike slicings producing toroidal intermediate stages\nduring merger.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this work, we have taken the first steps in examining the topological structure of event horizons in generic\nbinary black hole merger simulations. We focus on determining the topology of the two dimensional event horizon surface as it appears on spacelike slices of numerical relativity simulations. In particular, we concentrate\non the presence or absence of a toroidal event horizon,\nas previous work [3, 4, 11] has suggested that the existence of a toroidal horizon should appear generically in\nnon-axisymmetric mergers of black holes. In order to\nsharpen the discussion on toroidal horizons, we examine\n\n\f12\nments in our event horizon finding code and summarized the topological results for event horizons\nfound from SpEC binary black hole mergers. We\ndescribe our algorithm (which scales like O(N 2 )\nwhere N is the number of horizon generators) to\ndetect crossover points, and we find that the computational cost is not prohibitive for finding the\nevent horizons of binary black hole mergers.\n2. In Section IV, we reviewed the caustic and\ncrossover structure of the event horizons of binary black hole mergers for the axisymmetric and\ngeneric cases. Concentrating on spatial slicings\nthat result in toroidal event horizons, we diagram\nslices of the event horizon in multiple spatial and\ntemporal directions in order to elucidate the caustic and crossover structure present in the cases of\ntoroidal and non-toroidal event horizons.\n3. Subsequently, in our introduction to Section V, we\nhave discussed a necessary condition for a spatial\nslice of the event horizon surface to be toroidal:\nthe existence of a maximally path-connected set of\ncrossover points that is disconnected from all caustic points.\n\nFIG. 14: Color online. Same as Figure 11 but at time\nt = 124.400M \u2217 . The crossover set on the left side of the\nbridge connecting the holes extends past the extents of the\nlower screenshot and is bounded by caustics that are outside the view of the frame. Also, on the right edge of the\nbridge, note the extended line of caustics and the presence\nof crossovers between the caustics. This appears to be the\neffect of finite resolution in the event horizon finder, since the\nappearance is different in the right and left panels. Such numerical phenomena suggest the need for advanced techniques\nsuch as adaptive refinement of geodesic placement if we wish\nto completely resolve event horizon features at a reasonable\ncomputational cost.\n\nthe caustic and crossover structure of the event horizon\nfrom a theoretical (Sec IV) and numerical (Sec V) point\nof view. Following Husa and Winicour [11], we emphasize\nthe distinction between caustic points, where neighboring (infinitesimally separated) geodesics cross and join\nthe horizon, and crossover points, where geodesics separated by a finite angle cross and join the horizon. Note\nthat the union of caustics and crossovers are the 'crease\nset' discussed in the work of Siino [3, 4]. We now would\nlike to recount the main topics we have discussed:\n1. First, in Sections I\u2013III we have described improve-\n\n4. Finally, we presented a detailed analysis of the\nevent horizons found numerically from two inspiraling binary black hole simulations. We find in\nall cases that the intersection of the event horizon with any of our constant-time spatial hypersurfaces is topologically spherical rather than toroidal.\nDespite the lack of toroids, the structure of caustics and crossovers in our simulations are consistent\nwith Husa & Winicour [11]. We paid particular\nattention to analyzing the generic merger for consistency when varying several different numerical\nresolutions. Though only two resolutions are compared in this paper, we have made public the visualization data for all four resolutions of the generic\nmerger that we examined [25]. We encourage the\nreader to view at least one of our data sets in 3D,\nas this is perhaps the most powerful way to gain insight into the behavior of the event horizons from\nour simulations.\nFor the simulations presented here, it is difficult to\ncompute a precise upper limit on the size of any tori\nthat might exist in the exact solution but are too small\nfor us to detect in the simulations. The main reason\nfor this difficulty is that our ability to resolve features\nof the event horizon depends not only on the numerical\nresolution used to solve Einstein's equations, but also on\nthe resolution of the algorithm used to find and classify\nevent horizon generators. The latter resolution dominates in the examples presented here. This is because\nin our current method, the geodesics are located on a\nfixed computational mesh that is chosen at the beginning of the backwards-in-time geodesic integration (i.e.\nat late times). We suggest that the best way to tackle\n\n\f13\nthis issue would be to devise an event horizon finding\nalgorithm with iterative or adaptive geodesic resolution\nand placement. Thus, one could build into the adaptive\nmethod a target precision with which to resolve caustic and crossover sets. Though challenging, such an approach would allow one to investigate the topological\nstructure of numerical event horizons to a much higher\nprecision, while also providing a solid quantitative measure of the precision to which features are resolved.\nBefore we conclude, we would like to discuss a few important open questions about how the slicing condition\nused in our numerical simulations relates to the topological structure of the observed spatial cross sections of the\nevent horizon: 1) Can an existing simulation be re-sliced\nto produce a toroidal cross section of the event horizon?\n2) Alternatively, could the gauge conditions of our generalized harmonic evolution code be modified in order to\nproduce a binary black hole merger in a spatial slicing\nwith a toroidal event horizon? 3) Why have recent numerical simulations of merging black holes not produced\nslicings with a toroidal horizon when it has been thought\nthat an intermediate toroidal phase should be relatively\ngeneric? The answer to the first question is clearly 'yes'.\nPrevious work in the literature [3, 4, 6, 11] shows that it\nis possible to have a spacelike slicing of a dynamical event\nhorizon with a toroidal topology, and that the question\nof whether the horizon is toroidal depends on how the\nspacelike slice intersects the spacelike crossover set X , as\nwe review in Section IV.\nQuestions 2) & 3), however, are far more mysterious\nand are ripe for future investigation. Is the lack of toroids\nin our simulations endemic to the types of foliations used\nin numerical relativity as a whole, or just to the generalized harmonic [18, 26, 27] gauge conditions we currently\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n\n[12]\n[13]\n\nS.

It would be interesting to see if\na toroidal event horizon phase could be produced from\nthe same initial data used in our current simulations by\nmodifying gauge conditions in such a way as to retard\nthe lapse function near the merger point of the black\nholes. So far our attempts to do so have been unsuccessful. Hence, it has been speculated that some property\nof those numerical gauge choices that yield stable binary\nblack hole evolutions also avoids slicings in which the\nevent horizon is toroidal.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank Saul Teukolsky, Jeff Winicour,\nand Aaron Zimmerman for useful discussions on toroidal\nhorizons.
