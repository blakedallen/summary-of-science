For an incompressible neo-Hookean material\n[Og 84], [BOP 92] such as vulcanized rubber, in the equilibrium, one is interested\nminimizing the potential energy\nZ\nI[u] :=\nF (\u2207u),\n(1.1)\n\u03a9\n\nfor incompressible W 1,2 deformations u : \u03a9 \u2192 R2 with prescribed boundary conditions corresponding to a given bulk energy F : R2\u00d72 \u2192 R. The simplest F is the\n1\nDirichlet energy F (X) := tr (X T X). Let us denote the incompressible or so-called\n2\n1\n\n\fthe area-preserving mappings\nA := {u \u2208 W 1,2 (\u03a9, R2 ) : det\u2207u(x) = 1, a. e. in \u03a9},\n\n(1.2)\n\nu = (u1 , u2 ), \u2207u = (uixj )1\u2264i,j\u22642 , the gradient and det \u2207u := u1x1 u2x2 \u2212 u1x2 u2x1 , is the\nJacobian of u. A function f : Rm\u00d7n \u2192 R is said to be quasiconvex if\nZ\nf (X + \u2207\u03c6(x)) dx \u2265 f (X)\n(0,1)n\n\nfor each m \u00d7 n matrices X and each smooth compactly supported \u03c6 : (0, 1)n \u2192\nRm . This definition was introduced by Morrey [Mo 52], as a necessary and sufficient\ncondition for weak lower semicontinuity of the energy functional associated to f with\nrespect to uniform convergence of Lipschitz functions. Under the basic assumption\nthat F : R2\u00d72 \u2192 R is smooth, quasiconvex with quadratic growth, together with the\nweak continuity [Mu 89] of the Jacobian, the functional I admits local (see for example\n[EG 99]) minimizers in the class A. It remains a difficult problem (due to the hard\nJacobian constraint) to understand the regularity properties of the local minimizes\nof I. Under the additional assumption (the so-called uniform quasiconvexity, see,\n[Ev 86])\nZ\nZ\n|\u2207\u03c6|2 dx\n\nF (X + \u2207\u03c6(x)) \u2212 F (X) dx \u2265 C\n\n(0,1)2\n\n(1.3)\n\n(0,1)2\n\nfor some C > 0, for each 2 \u00d7 2 matrices X and each smooth compactly supported \u03c6 :\n(0, 1)2 \u2192 R2 , Evans and Gariepy [EG 99] proved that any non-degenerate, Lipschitz\narea-preserving local minimizers of I are C 1,\u03b1 on a dense open subset. It remains to\nunderstand whether area-preserving local minimizers are Lipschitz. Here we consider\nonly the global minimizers. A map u \u2208 A is said to be global minimizer of I subject\nto its own boundary if\nI[u] \u2264 I[v], for all v \u2208 A.\nTheorem 1.1. Let F : R2\u00d72 \u2192 R be uniformly quasiconvex, C 2 , and D 2 F is bounded.\nThen global minimizers of I in the area-preserving class A are Lipschitz. Furthermore,\nif F is uniformly convex and frame indifference then the minimizers are affine\nThe proof follows by reducing the minimization problem to a partial differential\nrelation of the form\n\u2207u(x) \u2208 K a.e. in \u03a9,\nfor suitable subset K of R2\u00d72 . As a consequence of this observation and a theorem\nof M\u00fcller and \u0160ver\u00e1k [MS 96] on convex integration (also see, [DM 97]), we give an\nexample of non-affine minimizers subject to affine boundary data corresponding to a\nconvex (non-uniform) energy.\n\n2\n\nProof of Theorem 1.1.\n\nWe recall the set of area-preserving mappings\nA := {u \u2208 W 1,2 (\u03a9, R2 ) : det\u2207u(x) = 1, a. e. in \u03a9}.\n2\n\n\fLet SL(2) := {P \u2208 R2\u00d72 : det P = 1}, the special linear group and\nZmin (F ) := {Q \u2208 SL(2) : F (Q) = min F (P )},\nP \u2208SL(2)\n\n(2.4)\n\nbe the minimizing set. Since F is uniformly quasiconvex, the minimizing set Zmin (F )\nis non-empty and compact. Without loss of generality assume |\u03a9| = 1. Observe that\nfor any v \u2208 A, we have\nZ\nI[v] =\nF (\u2207v) \u2265 min{F (P ) : det P = 1}.\n(2.5)\n\u03a9\n\nLet Q \u2208 Zmin (F ) and u(x) = Qx, be a linear deformation. Then u \u2208 A and\nI[u] = F (Q) = min F (P ).\nP \u2208SL(2)\n\nTherefore\nmin I[v] = min F (P ).\nv\u2208A\n\nP \u2208SL(2)\n\n(2.6)\n\nHence u \u2208 A is a minimizer of I if and only if it satisfies the partial differential\ninclusion\n\u2207u(x) \u2208 Zmin (F ) a.e. in \u03a9,\n(2.7)\nSince Zmin (F ) is compact, u is Lipschitz. This proves first part of the theorem.\nLemma 2.1. Let F : R2\u00d72 \u2192 R be uniformly convex, that is, D 2 F (X)Y : Y \u2265 2\u03bb|Y |2\nfor some \u03bb > 0, for all X, Y \u2208 R2\u00d72 . Suppose further, F (RX) = F (X) for each\nX \u2208 R2\u00d72 , and each rotations R. Then the minimizing set Zmin (F ) is simply the coset\nSO(2)P , for some det P = 1, where SO(2) := {R \u2208 R2\u00d72 : RT R = Id, det R = 1},\nthe special orthogonal group.\nProof. Here we follow the standard uniqueness arguments. Suppose there exists\nQ1 , Q2 \u2208 SL(2) that F (Q1 ) = F (Q2 ) = minSL(2) F (P ). Since F is frame indifferent,\nit follows that any\nQ \u2208 K := SO(2)Q1 \u222a SO(2)Q2\nalso minimizes F over SL(2). We claim that Q1 and Q2 are conformally equivalent,\ni.e., Q1 = RQ2 , for some R \u2208 SO(2). Suppose, Q1 and Q2 are not conformally\nequivalent. Since det Q1 = det Q2 = 1, a simple calculation shows that the cosets\nSO(2)Q1 and SO(2)Q2 are rank-one connected. Therefore for each P1 \u2208 SO(2) there\nexists P2 \u2208 SO(2) such that\ndet (P1 Q1 \u2212 P2 Q2 ) = 0.\nSince X 7\u2192 det X is linear along rank-one directions, it follows that\ndet (\u03bbP1 Q1 + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)P2 Q2 ) = 1, for all 0 \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 1.\nFrom the uniform convexity of F , we have\nF (X) \u2265 F (Y ) + DF (Y ) : (X \u2212 Y ) + \u03bb|X \u2212 Y |2 , for all X, Y \u2208 R2\u00d72 ,\n3\n\n(2.8)\n\n\ffor some \u03bb > 0, where A : B := tr(AT B) is the scalar product. By taking X = P1 Q1\nand Y = (P1 Q1 + P2 Q2 )/2, and vice versa and adding these two inequalities, we\nobtain\n\u0012\n\u0013\nP1 Q1 + P2 Q2\nF (P1 Q1 ) + F (P2 Q2 ) \u2265 2F\n+ 2\u03bb|P1 Q1 \u2212 P2 Q2 |2 .\n2\nSince F (P1 Q1 ) = F (P2 Q2 ) = minSL(2) F and (P1 Q1 + P2 Q2 )/2 \u2208 SL(2), it follows\nthat P1 Q1 = P2 Q2 , a contradiction. Hence the minimizing set Zmin(F ) := {P \u2208\nSL(2) : F (P ) = minSL(2) F (Q)} is just one copy of the special orthogonal group\nSO(2). This proves the lemma.\nSuppose F is uniformly convex and u \u2208 A is a minimizer of I. Then by (2.7) and\nlemma 2.1, it follows that\n\u2207u(x) \u2208 SO(2)P a.e.\n\nin \u03a9,\n\n(2.9)\n\nfor some det P = 1. From the Liouville Theorem of Reshetnyak [Re 68], it follows\nthat u is affine. However for the convenience of the readers we give a proof, which\nis due to Kinderlehrer [Ki 88] (the same proof works in all dimensions). Let us\nmake the change of variables, v : P \u22121(\u03a9) \u2192 R2 , by v(P \u22121x) = u(x), x \u2208 \u03a9. Then\n\u2207v(P \u22121 x) = \u2207u(x) P . Hence\n\u2207v(y) \u2208 SO(2) a.e.\n\nin P \u22121 (\u03a9).\n\nSince cof Q = Q on SO(2), and\ndiv cof \u2207v = 0,\n(div is taken in each rows) it follows that v is harmonic, i.e., \u2206v = (\u2206v 1 , \u2206v 2 ) = (0, 0)\nand hence smooth. Since |\u2207v|2 = 2, the identity\n1\n\u2206|\u2207v|2 = |\u22072 v|2 + \u2207v : \u2207\u2206v\n2\nyields \u22072 v = 0 in P \u22121 (\u03a9) and hence u is affine in \u03a9. This proves the theorem.\nRemark 1. The proof shows that the energy minimizing volume-preserving W 1,n\ndeformations on bounded open subsets of Rn , for n \u2265 2 are Lipschitz.\nRemark 2. However, for n \u2265 3, we are unable to conclude whether minimizers\ncorresponding to frame indifferent uniformly convex functions on Rn\u00d7n are necessarily\naffine. Let us briefly discuss the case n = 3. For any given 3 \u00d7 3 matrices Q1 and Q2\nwith determinant 1, the cosets SO(3) Q1 and SO(3) Q2 are not necessarily rank-one\nconnected (this is the main difference with the two dimension), so the above proof\nfails to conclude SO(3) Q1 = SO(3) Q2. If the cosets are not rank-one connected\n(for example, the SO(3) and SO(3) Q2, Q2 = diag (\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , \u03bb3 ), 0 < \u03bb1 \u2264 \u03bb2 \u2264 \u03bb3 ,\n\u03bb2 6= 1, \u03bb1 \u03bb2 \u03bb3 = 1 are not rank-one connected) it is natural to determine whether\nany Lipschitz map u : \u03a9 \u2282 R3 \u2192 R3 satisfying\n\u2207u(x) \u2208 Z := SO(3) Q1 \u222a SO(3) Q2 a.e.\n4\n\nin \u03a9 \u2282 R3\n\n(2.10)\n\n\fare necessarily affine. From the separation lemma [CM 04, Lemma 2.4] it is enough\n2,2\nto show that such solutions u are Wloc\n. In order to obtain such regularity one usually\ntries to find a suitable system of partial differential equations for u satisfying (2.10).\nHowever, it follows that there are no uniformly elliptic system of PDEs (as the set Z\nis not strongly incompatible, see, [CM 04]) for u in (2.10). This suggests that there\nare no obvious way of getting W 2,2 regularity.\n\n3\n\nNon-affine Minimizers\n\nIn this section we show that there are convex functions F for which the functional\nI in (1.1) admits area-preserving non-affine minimizers even with prescribed affine\nboundary data. To obtain such minimizers, idea is to look for a smooth convex\n(not uniform) function F such that the minimizing set Zmin(F ) strictly contains two\ncopies of SO(2), which are rank-one connected. Then trivially one obtains non-affine\nminimizers, for example, simple laminates. But interestingly, by a theorem of M\u00fcller\nand \u0160ver\u00e1k [MS 96], on convex integration, we can find non-affine minimizers with\nprescribed affine boundary.\nLet H := diag (\u03bb, \u03bc), be a diagonal matrix such that 0 < \u03bb < 1 < \u03bc and \u03bb\u03bc = 1.\nSet\nK := SO(2) \u222a SO(2) H,\nthe two wells. Then a simple calculation shows that each matrix in K is rank-one\nconnected with exactly two other matrices in K. Define F : R2\u00d72 \u2192 R by\nF := sup{g : g convex on R2\u00d72 , g \u2264 dist2 (* , K)},\nthe convex envelope of the square of the distance function dist(* , K). Therefore F\nis smooth, convex and the second derivative of F uniformly bounded.
