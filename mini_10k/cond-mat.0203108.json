The BornOppenheimer potential for the hydrogen, extracted directly from data for the first time, is consistent\nwith neutron diffraction data, and the vibrational spectrum is in substantial agreement with infrared\nabsorption measurements. The measurements are sensitive enough to detect the effect of surrounding\nligands on the hydrogen bond, and can be used to study the systematic effect of the variation of\nthese ligands.\n\ns PACS numbers, 61.12-q, 64.60-i,77.80-c\n\nIt is known that in KDP [1]\neach proton is equally likely to be in either of two positions in the hydrogen bond above the ferroelectric phase\ntransition at Tc=124K, where the structure is tetragonal, and is nearly entirely in one site below Tc, where the\nstructure is orthorhombic. What has not been known, and which has been a subject of controversy since Blinc [2]\nproposed the idea in 1973, is whether the protons are tunnelling between the two equivalent sites or are localized in\none or the other of the two sites and simply disordered above the transition. While the tunnelling model was used\nto describe the data for some time after it was proposed, Raman scattering data [3] that seemed to show that the\nsymmetry of the surroundings of the proton did not change above and below the transition, together with subsequent\nneutron scattering results [4], led to the consensus that the proton was self trapped in one or the other of its equivalent\npositions, and jumped from position to position through phonon assisted tunnelling. If such a picture were correct,\nthe proton would be in one site or the other in the high temperature phase for times much longer than the time\nscale of our experiment(10\u221215 sec), not simultaneously in both. The transition would be an order-disorder type in\nwhich the populations of the two sites became unequal below the ordering temperature. As pointed out by Reiter\nand Silver [5], neutron Compton scattering provides a means to distinguish between the tunnelling and the order\ndisorder model. If the latter were correct, NCS should see only a small change in the momentum distribution. This\nwould be due to whatever changes occurred in going through the transition to the potential of individual wells in\nwhich the proton was trapped. By contrast, if the particle were tunnelling and then became trapped, we should see\na narrowing of the momentum distribution in the tunnelling phase, together with an oscillation due to the coherent\ninterference of the proton in the two sites. We show here that the distributions at temperatures above and below the\nferroelectric transition are, in fact, dramatically different, and consistent with the proton coherently occupying the two\nsites. Since the bond is symmetric above the transition, one can construct the effective Born-Oppenheimer potential\ndirectly (without any model) from the measurement of the momentum distribution [5]. This is as far as we know,\nthe first such measurement of a Born-Oppenheimer potential in any system. It yields a double well potential with\nparameters consistent with neutron crystallography and incoherent neutron scattering at lower scattering energies,\nand yields vibration frequencies consistent with infrared measurements. The experiments are done on the electron volt\nspectrometer, EVS, at ISIS, the pulsed neutron source at the Rutherford Laboratory. This sort of source is needed to\nprovide high energy neutrons(5-10 ev) for which the energy transfer is sufficiently large compared to the characteristic\nenergies of the system that the scattering is given accurately by the impulse [6] approximation limit. The scattering\nat these energies is entirely incoherent, each particle scattering independently. SM (~q, \u03c9), the scattering function for a\nparticle of mass M, is related to the momentum distribution of the particle n(~\np) in this limit by the relation\nZ\nh\u0304q 2\n~p.~q\nSM (~\nq , \u03c9) = n(~\np)\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212\n\u2212\n)d~\np\n(1)\n2M\nM\n1\n\n\fwhere h\u0304\u03c9 is the energy transfer, M is the mass of the proton, and q=|~q| is the magnitude of the wave-vector transfer.\n2 2\nq\n, that\nThe small mass of the proton leads to a broad distribution in energy of the scattered neutrons, centered at h\u03042M\nis well separated from the scattering from the heavier ions such as oxygen, which appear as nearly elastic contributions.\nThis, together with its large incoherent cross-section, make it an ideal candidate for these measurements. n(~\np), the\nprobability of observing the proton with momentum p~, for simple one particle systems in their ground state, is the\nsquare of the absolute value of the fourier transform of the spatial wave-function. The experimental data is fit in a\nmodel free way using a series expansion that allows one to reconstruct n(p)directly from the fitted coefficients. We\nq2\nM\nrepresent SM (~q, \u03c9) as M\nq J(q\u0302, y) where y= q (\u03c9 \u2212 2M ), and expand J(q\u0302, y) as\nJ(q\u0302, y) =\n\n2\ne\u2212y X\n1\n\n\u03c02\n\nan,l,m H2n+l (y)Ylm (q\u0302)\n\n(2)\n\nn,l,m\n\nwhere the Hn (y) are Hermite polynomials and the Ylm are spherical harmonics. This series is truncated at some\norder(2n+l=10) in this case) , convolved with the instrumental resolution function and then least squares fit to the\ndata. The coefficients an,l,m then determine the measured n(~\np) directly as a series in Laguerre polynomials and\nspherical harmonics [5,7] The procedure is a smoothing operation, which works with noisy data, and which also\nallows for the inclusion of small corrections to the impulse approximation [7,8]. The errors in the measured n(~\np) are\ndetermined by the uncertainty in the the measured coefficients,through their correlation matrix, which is calculated\nby the fitting program. For an expanded discussion of the procedure and errors see Ref 7. In fitting the data, we take\nthe z axis to be along the bond axis, the x axis to be the c axis of the crystal, perpendicular to both bonds, and fit\nthe data with the sum of two terms, one rotated by 90 degrees about the x axis from the other. The measurement\nprovides the complete 3-D momentum distribution. We show in Fig. 1 a cut along the px \u2212pz plane for the momentum\ndistribution of a single bond at two temperatures, one far below and one just above the transition. The measurements\nwere taken with exactly the same experimental configuration, and analyzed with exactly the same terms kept in the\nseries expansion. If the order-disorder picture of the transition had been correct, we would expect to see small changes\nin the momentum distribution on going through the transition, as the proton would remain localized in one or the\nother equivalent sites, and the confining potential at that site would be only slightly modified. In fact we see dramatic\nchanges in the width and the shape of the momentum distribution. While there is little change in the direction normal\nto the bond, the distribution along the bond changes qualitatively.\n\n2\n\n\fFIG. 1.

The bulge in (b) along the direction roughly 30deg from the bond axis, that is the\nprojection of the displacement from the center of the bond to the phosphorus ion, is interpreted as being due to the repulsion\nof the proton by the phosphorus.\n\nThe momentum distribution along the bond axis for both temperatures is shown in Fig. 2.

The dotted curves surrounding the heavy lines are one standard deviation error markers. The inset is a\ncomparison of the measured momentum distribution at T=90K with a recent calculation by Koval, Kohanoff and Migoni[11]\nin which their ab-initio one particle potential along the bond was used to calculate the momentum distribution from the one\ndimensional Schrodinger equation,assuming the three dimensional potential was separable.\n\nWe see that overall, there is considerable narrowing of the distribution in the high temperature phase, indicating an\nincrease in the length along the bond over which the spatial wave function is coherent. The prominent feature of the\nhigh temperature distribution, the zero and the subsequent oscillation, is precisely what one would expect for a spatial\nwave-function that was coherent over both sites, with the position of the zero being determined by the separation of\nthe sites.\nThe momentum distribution contains many body effects due to the motion of the surrounding ions. These effects\nare quite small for the heavy ions [12], but could be significant for the interaction of the protons with themselves. If\nwe treating them in a mean field approximation, we can calculate an effective one body Born-Oppenheimer potential\nfrom the momentum distribution in the high temperature phase, assuming the proton is in its ground state [5]. We\nwill assume the potential is separable to simplify this calculation, so that we only need the data along the pz axis.\nThe error bars on the measurements are such that there is considerable uncertainty in the tail of the distribution,\nand one could argue that there is no oscillation. If, however, we take the zero of the most probable distribution\nto be real, and choose the sign of the wave-function as negative for momenta greater than the momentum at the\nzero , then we find the effective Born-Oppenheimer potential and the spatial wave function shown in Fig. 3. If\nwe do not change the sign , we get a completely un-physical potential. It is clear that the most likely momentum\ndistribution measured supports a tunnelling model. The tunnel splitting is 94 mev(\u223c1000K), so that our assumption\nthat we are seeing only the ground state is consistent. Even if one doesn't take seriously the oscillation in the tail of\nthe momentum distribution, and assumes that the actual distribution goes smoothly to zero, we would find a much\nbroader potential above Tc than below, and the order-disorder model would be equally untenable. That potential\nwould, however, be inconsistent with the neutron crystallography [1], which clearly shows a double peak structure for\nthe spatial wave-function, as in Fig. 3.\n\n4\n\n\fKDP Potential and Wavefunction\n2000\nPotential\nWave Function(arb. units)\n1500\n\nMILLI\u2212EV\n\n1000\n\n500\n\n0\n\n\u2212500\n\u22120.4\n\n\u22120.3\n\n\u22120.2\n\n\u22120.1\n\n0\nAngstroms\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\nFIG. 3. The effective Born-Oppenheimer potential that corresponds to the measured momentum distribution along the bond\nat T=130K, (Fig. 2) , together with the spatial wave function for that potential. The horizontal lines give the first four energy\nlevels for the measured potential.\n\nAlthough the potential in Fig. 3 is quite different from that inferred from infrared absorption data by Lawrence and\nRobertson [13] who assumed that it could be described by back-to-back Morse potentials, the transition energies they\nbased the fit on are substantially the same as those in the figure. LR identify the 0\u21923 transition as having an energy\nof 4600 cm\u22121 , whereas we obtain 5088 cm\u22121 . For the 1\u21922 transition, LR obtain 2260 cm\u22121 while we obtain 2039\ncm\u22121 . Neutron crystallography studies have fit the shape of the spatial wave-function with the sum of two displaced\nGaussians, which would give a rather different potential than that of Fig. 3, and obtained a separation of the minima\nof the potential, of .34 Angstroms. We find .31 Angstroms for this separation. The shape of the spatial wave function\nin Fig. 3 is qualitatively similar to that described in Ref. 1. We conclude that the potential of Fig. 3 is at least\nqualitatively correct, and that the proton is indeed tunnelling between equivalent sites in the high temperature phase.\nBelow the transition, since the potential is not symmetric, it is not possible to invert the data to obtain it, as phase\ninformation is lost in the momentum distribution. If one has a prediction for the potential, one can, however, calculate\nthe momentum distribution. In the inset of Fig. 2, we show the momentum distribution obtained from a recent [11]\nab-initio calculation of the Born-Oppenheimer potential for KDP in which the electronic many-body problem was\ntreated by density functional theory . The one particle approximation is evidently reasonably good here. The same\ncalculations shows that there are significant interactions amongst the hydrogens above Tc , so that an unambiguous\none particle potential cannot be obtained theoretically, as the potential for the motion of a single particle depends\nsensitively on the positions assumed for the surrounding hydrogen. The present measurements provide a means of\ntesting theoretical inclusions of these many body effects on the effective one particle potential, which should reproduce\nthe observed momentum distribution.\nIf a hydrogen bond were isolated, the momentum distribution would have to be symmetric about the bond axis.\nWe find that distribution in the px \u2212 py plane, (not shown here) is significantly broader at 45 degrees to either axis\nthan it is along the axes. This direction is approximately the projection in the x-y plane of the vector from the\ncenter of the bond to the phosphorus ion [14]. If we return to Fig. 1, we see that there is also a broadening of\nthe distribution in the high temperature phase at approximately 30 degrees to the z axis, which is the approximate\ndirection of the projection of the vector from the center of the bond to the phosphorus ion on the x-z plane. This\nbroadening becomes a narrowing at low temperatures. We conclude that this broadening in momentum space is a\nresult of the repulsion of the proton by the phosphorus ion, and that the transition displaces the particles in a way\nthat reduces that repulsion. This is in broad agreement with both the calculation cited above and another recent\nab-initio calculation [15] that showed that the motion of the phosphorus had large effects on the hydrogen potential\nsurface. We conclude that the experiments are easily sensitive enough to see the effect of the surrounding ions on the\nhydrogen bond, and include many body effects that are difficult to calculate with existing methods. This sensitivity\nopens up the possibility of studying the effect of the systematic variation of the surrounding ligands on the dynamics\nof hydrogen bonds. The knowledge gained could then be used to identify the best models and ab-initio approximation\nschemes, and to infer the behavior of the bonds in environments where the measurements can't be done because there\nare two many inequivalent hydrogens, such as in DNA or proteins.\n\n5\n\n\fACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe would like to thank Devinder Sivia for assistance in analyzing the data, Richard Nelmes, Jorge Kohanoff ,\nNicholas Kioussis and Naresh Dalal for useful discussions, and Jorge Kohanoff for permission to use the results of Ref.\n11.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n\nR.
