Although this response in single trajectories\nis intrinsically random, the ensemble-averaged TAV response is linear.\nPACS numbers: 05.45.Ac, 05.40.Fb, 87.15.Vv\n\n1\n\n\fIntroduction.-Intrinsic randomness in macroscopic observables has been found in a broad\nrange of processes more recently from biological transport to fluorescence of single nanocrystals [1\u20133]. Diffusion coefficients in biological transports show large fluctuations [1, 2]. The\nratio of an on-state in the fluorescence of nanocrystals does not converge to a constant and\nis different in each quantum dot [3]. The randomness of time-averaged observables can be\ncharacterized by power-law trapping time distributions in stochastic models, such as those\nin continuous time random walks (CTRWs) [4, 5] and dichotomous stochastic processes [6].\nSuch randomness is due to the breakdown of the law of large numbers stemming from a\ndiverging mean trapping time.\nDynamical systems with infinite-invariant measures can be viewed as stochastic processes\ngenerating random time-averaged observables. Infinite ergodic theory plays an important\nrole in elucidating such observables [7\u201311]. It guarantees that a time average of an observation function converges in distribution. In other words, time-averaged observables are\nintrinsically random if the invariant measure cannot be normalized. In dynamical systems\ngenerating subdiffusion, the distributional limit theorem for the diffusion coefficients obtained by the time-averaged mean square displacements (TAMSDs) has been shown using\ninfinite ergodic theory [12].\nIn anomalous diffusion, the mean square displacement (MSD) grows non-linearly with\ntime, hx(t)2 i \u221d t\u03b1 (\u03b1 6= 1). Diffusion is called subdiffusion if \u03b1 < 1 and superdiffusion\nif \u03b1 > 1. One mechanism generating subdiffusion is the divergence in the mean trapping\ntime describing random walks of CTRW. If the mean trapping time diverges, the diffusion\ncoefficients obtained from TAMSDs become random [4, 5, 12]. Three different mechanisms\nunderlying superdiffusion have been identified: One stems from positive correlations in random walks, modeled by a fractional Brownian motion [13]; The second from a persistent\nmotions in random walks, called L\u00e9vy walks [14]; The third from very long jumps in random\nwalks, called L\u00e9vy flights [15]. In L\u00e9vy walks and flights, the second moment of the length\nof persistence motion and of jumps diverges because of a power law. Such power laws are\nobserved in Hamiltonian systems [16], rotating flow [17], polymer diffusion [15], biological\ntransport [18], intermittent search [19], and light diffusion [20]. Persistent times in L\u00e9vy\nwalks and trapping times in CTRWs are characterized by indifferent fixed points in deterministic models [21]. Therefore, random transport coefficients will be observed in L\u00e9vy walk\nwith the divergent mean persistent time.\n2\n\n\fAlthough random transport coefficients are universal in subdiffusion because of power-law\ntrapping times, it is not clear whether time-averaged observables are intrinsically random in\nsuperdiffusions. Moreover, little is known about responses of time-averaged drifts (TADs)\nto biases in superdiffusions whereas in anomalous diffusion a generalized Einstein relation\nholds [22]. In this Letter, we show a distributional limit theorem for TADs using deterministic superdiffusion models related to L\u00e9vy walks under bias and no bias. Surprisingly, a\nTAD is intrinsically random whether biased and unbiased. The result leads to a distributional response to bias, i.e., the response to a bias would be characterized by a change in\ndistribution.\nModel.- Anomalous superdiffusion that originates from a persistent motion or a long\njump has been studied for chaotic dynamical systems [23, 24]. To study a response to\na bias in deterministic superdiffusions related to L\u00e9vy walks, we propose an asymmetric\ndeterministic diffusion model, constructed by introducing an asymmetry in the Geisel model\n[23]. In particular, we consider the following map T : R \u2192 R,\nxn+1 = T (xn ),\n\n(1)\n\nwhich have a translational symmetry (L = Z)\nT (x + L) = T (x) + L,\nand the map T (x) is given by\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 (x \u2212 L) +\nT (x) =\n\uf8f3\n(x \u2212 L) \u2212\n\n\u0001\nx\u2212L z\nc\n\n\u0001\nL\u2212x z\n1\u2212c\n\n(2)\n\n+ L \u2212 1, x \u2208 [L, L + c),\n(3)\n+ L + 1, x \u2208 [L \u2212 c, L),\n\nwhere c is a parameter characterizing an asymmetry. This model corresponds to a L\u00e9vy walk\nwhere leftward and rightward persistent time distributions have the same scaling exponent,\ni.e., \u03c8(t) \u221d t\u2212\u03b2 but the probabilities of the leftward and rightward walk are different.\nReduced map.- As can be seen in Fig. 1, points near the fixed points, x = 0 and x = 1,\non [0, 1] move to the left neighboring cell or the right neighboring cell, respectively. By\ntranslational symmetry, we can reduce an orbit of the map T (x) to that of an intermittent\nmap on [0, 1] (Fig. 1). For example, we can obtain the following reduced map,\n\uf8f1\n\u0001z\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nx + xc , mod 1 x \u2264 c,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nR(x) =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u0001\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 x \u2212 1\u2212x z , mod 1 x > c,\n1\u2212c\n3\n\n(4)\n\n\fwith 0 < c < 1. The invariant density of the reduced map is given by\n\u03c1(x) = h(x)x1\u2212z (1 \u2212 x)1\u2212z ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere h(x) is a continuous function satisfying h(0) 6= 0 and h(1) 6= 0 [25]. Thus, the\ninvariant density cannot be normalized for z \u2265 2. Consider the observation function\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u22121, x \u2208 [0, c1 ),\nf (x) =\n\n0, x \u2208 [c1 , c2 ),\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 +1, x \u2208 [c2 , 1),\n\n(6)\n\nwhere R(c1 ) = 1 (c1 < c) and R(c2 ) = 0 (c2 > c). It follows that Xn = f (x1 ) + * * * + f (xn )\nis regarded as a one-dimensional random walk, where xn = Rn (x0 ). The random walk Xn\ncorresponds to a L\u00e9vy walk where the persistent times distribution obeys a power law with\nexponent \u03b2 = z/(z \u2212 1).\nDependence of EAMSD on ensemble.-Ensemble-averaged MSD (EAMSD) and TAMSD\nare defined by\nK\u22121\n1 X m k\n(T (x ) \u2212 xk )2 ,\nK\u2192\u221e K\nk=0\n\nhx2m i = lim\n\n(7)\n\nwhere xk is the kth initial point, and\n\nn\u22121\n\n\u03b4x2m\n\n1X\nfm (xk ),\n= lim\nn\u2192\u221e n\nk=0\n\n(8)\n\nwhere fm (x) = (T m (x) \u2212 x)2 , respectively. For a finite invariant measure (z < 2), ergodicity\nholds, i.e., EAMSD = TAMSD if initial points are distributed according to the invariant\ndensity of the reduced map. We note that ergodicity does not hold when the invariant\nmeasure cannot be normalized (infinite invariant measure) because an equilibrium ensemble\ncannot be reproduced. The impossibility to reproduce an equilibrium ensemble leads to\naging [26]. In unbiased cases (c = 0.5), EAMSD is studied by the renewal theory and\ncontinuous time random walk [23, 27]:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nm2 ,\nz \u2265 2,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 m3\u22121/(z\u22121) , 3 < z < 2,\n2\n2\nhxm iE \u221d\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nm ln m,\nz = 23 ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nm,\n1 < z < 23 .\n4\n\n(9)\n\n\fFor c < 0.5, drifting motion arises in a direction toward the right.\n\nUnlike hyperbolic maps, statistical quantities determined by ensemble averages significantly depend on an initial ensemble in intermittent maps. In particular, it is shown that\nthe behavior of the correlation function and the power spectrum density depend on an initial ensemble [28]. In renewal theory [29], there are two well-known processes, i.e., ordinary\nrenewal and equilibrium renewal process. An initial ensemble corresponding to a specific\nrenewal process is reproducible in dynamical systems. In particular, an initial ensemble\nfor an equilibrium renewal process is an absolutely continuous invariant measure. Figure 2\nshows that the EAMSD depends on an initial ensemble. If an initial ensemble of EAMSD\nhas an invariant density (as in an equilibrium ensemble), all TAMSDs are equal to EAMSD\n(see Fig. 2).\n\nLamperti-Thaler's generalized arcsine law.-In dichotomous stochastic processes \u03c3n , an\nobservable determined by the time average of an observation function g(\u03c3n ) is known to show\nrandom behavior if the mean residence time of a state diverges. In particular, the ratio of\nthe occupation time of a state, Nn /n, does not converge to a constant, but converges in\ndistribution, where Nn is the occupation time of a state up to time n. The most classical\nexample is the arc-sine law in coin-tossing: the distribution of the ratio of the period that\na player is on the positive side converges to the arc-sine distribution [30]. Lamperti showed\nthat the distribution of the ratio of the occupation time of a state converges to the generalized\narc-sine distribution in general dichotomous stochastic processes [31].\n\nIn a dynamical system, the divergence of the mean residence time implies that the invariant density cannot be normalized [32]. Thaler has shown that the distribution of the\ntime average of a characteristic function converges to the generalized arc-sine distribution\n[8\u201310]. The generalized arc-sine law is valid for the time average of a non-L1 (\u03bc) funcR\ntion, i.e., |f |d\u03bc = \u221e [11]. Lamperti-Thaler's generalized arc-sine (LTGA) law [9] states\n\nthat for a map S : [0, 1] \u2192 [0, 1] satisfying (i) S([0, c]) = [0, 1] and S([c, 1]) = [0, 1], (ii)\nS \u2032 (x) > 1 on (0, c] \u222a [c, 1); S \u2032 (0) = S \u2032 (1) = 1, and (iii) S(x) \u2212 x \u223c a0 xp+1 (x \u2192 0) and\nx \u2212 S(x) \u223c a1 (1 \u2212 x)p+1 (x \u2192 1) with p > 1 and constants a0 , a1 > 0, and c \u2208 (0, 1), the\ntime average of the observation function g(x) with g(0) = a and g(1) = b converges in\n5\n\n\fdistribution:\nPr\n\n(\n\n)\n\nn\u22121\n\n1X\ng \u25e6 Sk \u2264 t\nn k=0\n\n\u2192\n\nt\u2212b\na\u2212b\n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 1 \u2212 G\u03b1,\u03b2\n\nwhere \u03b1 = 1/p,\n\u03b2=\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nG\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u03b1,\u03b2\n\n\u0001\nt\u2212b\na\u2212b\n\n(a > b)\n(10)\n\u0001\n\n(a < b)\n\nS \u2032 (c+ )\n,\n(a0 /a1 )1/p S \u2032 (c\u2212 )\n\n(11)\n\nand the probability density function (PDF) is given by\nG\u2032\u03b1,\u03b2 (t) =\n\n\u03b2 sin \u03b1\nt\u03b1\u22121 (1 \u2212 t)\u03b1\u22121\n.\n\u03c0 \u03b2 2 t2\u03b1 + 2\u03b2t\u03b1 (1 \u2212 t)\u03b1 cos \u03c0\u03b1 + (1 \u2212 t)2\u03b1\n\n(12)\n\nThis distribution is called the generalized arc-sine distribution, which emerges in a subdiffusive transport [33] and weakly non-ergodic statistical physics [6, 34]. The mean of the\noccupation time for a state xk < c, hNn /ni, is given by hNn /ni = 1/(1 + \u03b2). The ensemble\naverage of the time average of g(x) is given by (a + b\u03b2)/(1 + \u03b2). We note that the exponents\n\u03b1 and \u03b2 are determined by a behavior near the indifferent fixed points.\nDistributional response to a bias.-LTGA law cannot be applied to the reduced map of the\nasymmetric deterministic diffusion model with z \u2265 2 straightforwardly because the reduced\nmap does not satisfy the condition (i). However, the condition (i) is not crucial because\nan important point in LTGA law is the reinjection to the indifferent fixed points. In fact,\nthe conditions (i), (ii), and (iii) in [9] was generalized in [10]. The reinjection to the fixed\npoint x = 0 is determined by limx\u2192c1+0 R\u2032 (x) and limx\u2192c2 +0 R\u2032 (x). Moreover, the reinjection\nto the fixed point x = 1 is determined by limx\u2192c1\u22120 R\u2032 (x) and limx\u2192c2\u22120 R\u2032 (x). Because\nof limx\u2192c1+0 R\u2032 (x) = limx\u2192c1\u22120 R\u2032 (x), limx\u2192c2 +0 R\u2032 (x) = limx\u2192c2 \u22120 R\u2032 (x) and R\u2032 (x) > 1 on\n(0, c1 ] \u222a [c1 , c2 ] \u222a [c2 , 1), the way of a reinjection to x = 0 and x = 1 is the same. Since\nthe behavior near the indifferent fixed points is given by S(x) \u2212 x \u223c (x/c)z (x \u2192 0) and\nx \u2212 S(x) \u223c {(1 \u2212 x)/(1 \u2212 c)}z (x \u2192 1), we can apply LTGA law to the reduced map R(x).\nThen, the exponents \u03b1 and \u03b2 are given by\n1\n\u03b1=\nz\u22121\n\nand \u03b2 =\n\n\u0012\n\nc\n1\u2212c\n\nz\n\u0013 z\u22121\n\n.\n\n(13)\n\nFirst, we consider TAMSD, where the observation function fm (x) is the L1loc,\u03bc (0, 1) function with finite mean [11]. By LTGA law, fm (0) = m2 and fm (1) = m2 , TAMSD converges\nto m2 : \u03b4x2m = m2 for all c and z \u2265 2. We note that the ballistic behavior, \u03b4x2m = m2 , is not\n6\n\n\fdue to a drift for c = 0.5. Next, we consider the time-averaged drift (TAD) defined by the\ntime average of vm (x) = T m (x) \u2212 x:\nn\u22121\n\n1X\nvm (xk ),\nn\u2192\u221e n\n\n\u03b4xm = lim\n\n(14)\n\nk=0\n\nwhich is also the L1loc,\u03bc (0, 1) function with finite mean. Figure 3 shows TADs obtained from\ndifferent trajectories. By LTGA law, vm (0) = \u2212m and vm (1) = m, we have\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\b\nt+1\n.\nPr \u03b4xm /m \u2264 t \u2192 1 \u2212 G\u03b1,\u03b2\n2\n\n(15)\n\nThis distributional limit theorem states that the time-averaged velocity, defined by V \u2261\n\u03b4xm /m, under a bias is intrinsically random, i.e., distributional response. Numerical simulations are in good agreement with the theory (see Fig. 4). The ensemble average of V is\ngiven by\nV \u2261 hV iF =\n\n1\u2212\u03b2\n,\n1+\u03b2\n\n(16)\n\nwhere h*iF is the ensemble average under an external bias. Figure 4 shows the response of\nV to a bias c.\nGeneralized Einstein relation.-The asymmetric parameter c with 0 < c < 1 is considered to be the probability of leftward walk if a persistent motion is terminated. Let\nF\n\nF\n\nF\n\nc = e\u2212 kT /(e\u2212 kT + e kT ) be the leftward walk probability, where F is an external force, T is a\ntemperature, and k is the Boltzmann constant [22]. We consider a small bias, c \u223c\n= 1/2\u2212F/kT\nfor F \u2192 0. Expanding \u03b2 around c = 1/2 and substituting it into V , we obtain the linear\nresponse of V to a bias F :\nV \u223c \u22122\n\nz F\n.\nz \u2212 1 kT\n\n(17)\n\nAlthough TADs are intrinsically random, the TAMSDs are not random and grow as m2 for\nz \u2265 2. Therefore, we have the following generalized Einstein relation for superdiffusion:\nq\nz F\n\u03b4x2m .\n(18)\nh\u03b4xm iF = \u22122\nz \u2212 1 kT\nDiscussion.- We have found a distributional response in deterministic superdiffusion using the distributional limit theorem in infinite ergodic theory. In a recent study we obtained a\ngeneralized Einstein relation for single trajectories using Hopf's ergodic theorem [35]. However, this theorem does not work in deterministic superdiffusion because the observation\nfunction vm (x) is not an L1 (\u03bc) function. Therefore, a distributional response is essential in\n7\n\n\fsuperdiffusion. Moreover, we noted that the generalized Einstein relation (18) is different\nfrom that in anomalous diffusion [22]. We hope that our finding, i.e., the distributional\nresponse, will be observed in experiments of random time-averaged observables.\nThe author thanks Tomoshige Miyaguchi for discussions.
