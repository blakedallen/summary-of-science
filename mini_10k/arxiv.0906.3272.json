Proposed\ndualities between AdS2 space and a conformal quantum mechanics [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] or a chiral\n1+1 dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) [5, 7] have been used to explain the statistical\ndegeneracy of extremal black holes. In [7, 8] it was shown the AdS2 geometry with a constant\nelectric field can be understood as the compactification of an orbifold of AdS3 with a null\nboundary. Systematically applying the rules of the AdS/CFT correspondence then suggests\nthat the dual theory on the 1+1 dimensional boundary is a Discrete Light Cone Quantized\nCFT [7, 8, 9, 6]. Because of the highly boosted kinematics of a DLCQ theory, only one chiral\nsector of the 2d CFT survives. Such chiral theories thus seem to appear universally in the\ndual descriptions of extremal black holes.\nIn this paper, we develop aspects of this DLCQ - extremal black hole correspondence.\nThe essential features can be understood by considering the extremal BTZ geometry, which\nitself appears in the near-horizon geometry of many asymptotically flat or AdS black holes. It\nis well known that the BTZ black holes are dual to thermal ensembles in a 1+1 dimensional\nCFT. Thermal ensembles in a single chiral sector of this CFT are dual to the extremal\nblack holes and explain their statistical degeneracy. Taking a limit which focuses on the\nvicinity of the BTZ horizon gives a locally AdS3 geometry that is a circle fibration over an\nAdS2 base. From the three dimensional perspective this is precisely the self-dual orbifold\nof [8, 10]. Dimensionally reducing over the circle fibre gives an AdS2 geometry with an\nelectric flux \u2013 precisely the spacetime appearing in [7]. As we will show in sections 2 and\n1\n\nThis statement is an actual theorem in four and five dimensions, under certain isometry assumptions\nand for extremal black holes with finite area horizons [1].\n\n1\n\n\f3, the same focusing limit applied to the CFT dual to BTZ effectively applies a DLCQ\nprocedure that isolates the chiral sector carrying the extremal black hole entropy. Thus,\none chiral set of Virasoro generators of the CFT is frozen in this limit, in the sense that\nthere are no physical states charged under them. It turns out that the same chiral sector\nalso contains the SL(2, R) isometries of the AdS2 geometry, while the surviving SL(2, R)\nin the limiting chiral CFT appears as an enhancement of the U(1) symmetry of the circle\nfibration. Specifically, we show that there exists a consistent set of boundary conditions\non the fluctuations of the near horizon extremal BTZ metric, as in the Brown-Henneaux\nanalysis [11], that enhances the U(1) isometry to an asymptotic chiral Virasoro algebra.\nThis is consistent with recent proposals that the description of extremal black holes in terms\nof an AdS2 throat requires asymptotic boundary conditions eliminating AdS2 excitations\nand enhancing a U(1) appearing in the geometry to a Virasoro symmetry [12, 13].\nUsually in the AdS/CFT duality, the isometries of spacetime are realized in the dual as\nglobal symmetries which then organize the representations of physical states. The surprise\nhere is that the SL(2, R) symmetry inherited in the CFT from the spacetime isometries acts\ntrivially on the space of physical states. This has two implications. First, the chiral duals to\nthe near-horizon geometry of extremal black holes are incapable of describing non-extremal\nexcitations. Second, even after the addition of an electric field to AdS2 , 2d quantum gravity\nwith this asymptotics has no dynamics. This is consistent with the idea that finite energy\nexcitations in AdS2 destroy its asymptotic structure [14]. These two points are related to the\nfact that non-extremal black holes do not have AdS2 throats. Similarly, in the classic setting\nof the D1-D5-string, extremal black holes arise from chiral excitations, and non-extremality\nrequires excitations of both left and right movers.\nThe self-dual orbifold and AdS2 with a flux also appear in the near horizon limit of the\nextremal Kerr black hole in four dimensions [12] suggesting the appearance of a chiral CFT\ndual. However, in this setting (as in [15, 16, 17]) the near-horizon AdS geometries appear\nin a \"warped\" way, with their metric multiplied by a function of another angular direction\nin the overall spacetime. We suggest that reduction over this additional direction can give\nrise to an effective three dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological constant with the\nself-dual orbifold as a solution. The dual description of this space as a chiral 2d CFT then\nexplains the statistical degeneracy of Kerr.\nNote added: In the last stage of preparation of this article two papers appeared on the\narXiv [18] arguing that there is no dynamics in the chiral 2d CFT proposed to be dual to\nthe near horizon extremal Kerr geometry, in agreement with our results.\n\n2\n\nNear horizon extremal BTZ is dual to DLCQ of a 2d CFT\n\nBTZ black holes are three dimensional, asymptotically AdS3 spacetimes with metric [19]\nds2 = \u2212\n\n2\n2\n(r 2 \u2212 r+\n)(r 2 \u2212 r\u2212\n) 2\nl2 r 2\nr+ r\u2212 2\ndt\n+\ndr 2 + r 2 (d\u03c6 \u2212\ndt) .\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nr l\n(r \u2212 r+ )(r \u2212 r\u2212 )\nlr 2\n\n2\n\n(2.1)\n\n\fThey have ADM angular momentum and mass\nr+ r\u2212\nJ\n= 2 ,\n2\nl\n\nM=\n\n2\n2\nr+\n+ r\u2212\nl2\n\n(2.2)\n\ngiven in terms of two parameters: the inner and outer horizons r\u00b1 . These are locally AdS3\nspacetimes, differing from global AdS3 by a quotient under a discrete identification. This is\nthe origin of the periodicity in \u03c6 in (2.1), i.e. \u03c6 \u223c \u03c6 + 2\u03c0. Regularity of the metric requires\n|J| \u2264 M. The BTZ black holes also appear as components in the near-horizon geometry\nof black holes in many dimensions with both vanishing and negative cosmological constants\n(e.g. see [20]). The extremal BTZ black holes (M = J) have coincident inner and outer\nhorizons\nM =J\n=\u21d2\nr+ = r\u2212 \u2261 rh .\n(2.3)\nGlobally, the generator of the discrete quotient of AdS3 giving rise to the extremal black hole\nlies in a different conjugacy class from the generator giving rise to the non-extremal black\nhole [21].\nAccording to the AdS/CFT correspondence, quantum gravity in AdS3 is dual to a 2d\nconformal field theory (CFT) with equal left and right central charges c [11]\nc=\n\n3l\n,\n2G3\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere G3 is Newton's constant in three dimensions. The BTZ black holes are thermal states\nin this CFT having left and right-moving temperatures\nTR =\n\n1 r+ \u2212 r\u2212\n,\n4\u03c0\nl\n\nTL =\n\n1 r+ + r\u2212\n,\n4\u03c0\nl\n\n(2.5)\n\nL\u03040 \u2212\n\nc\n= M + J.\n24\n\n(2.6)\n\nwith energy and angular momentum:\nL0 \u2212\n\nc\n= M \u2212 J,\n24\n\n(In our conventions M and J are both dimensionless; their natural units are given by the\nAdS3 radius l.) In the extremal (M = J) black hole the right-movers are in the ground\nstate2\nc\n; TR = 0\n(2.7)\nL0 =\n24\n1 rh\nand L\u03040 are arbitrary. The extremal BTZ\nwhile the left moving temperature TL = 2\u03c0\nl\nentropy (and that of higher dimensional black holes of which it is the near horizon limit) is\n2\n\nIn theories with supersymmetry these are indeed the obvious ground states in the RR sector. This\ncondition can even correspond to ground states in the NS sector, because in many examples the quantum\nnumbers L0 and L\u03040 are not exactly identical to the standard CFT quantum numbers but can e.g. receive\ncontributions from gauge fields which make them spectral flow invariant, in which case this condition really\nimplies that the states have to be chiral primary. Although we have no proof that L0 = c/24 always implies\nthat the states have to be ground states of some sort, we will continue to refer to these states as ground\nstates and hope that this will not cause any confusion.\n\n3\n\n\faccounted for by the statistical degeneracy of such a chiral CFT sector with L\u03040 \u2212c/24 = 2M,\nat least when L\u03040 \u226b c/24.\n\nWe will see that the chiral sector that is responsible for the extremal entropy can be\nisolated by taking a near-horizon limit of the extremal BTZ black hole [7]. It is convenient\nto do this in another set of coordinates [22]\n\u00fb = t/l \u2212 \u03c6 ,\nin which the metric takes the form\n\nv\u0302 = t/l + \u03c6,\n\n2\nr 2 \u2212 r+\n= l2 e2\u03c1 ,\n\n(2.8)\n\n3\n\n2\nds2 = r+\nd\u00fb2 + l2 d\u03c12 \u2212 l2 e2\u03c1 d\u00fb dv\u0302 .\n\n(2.10)\n\nThe variables \u00fb, v\u0302 have a periodicity\n{\u00fb, v\u0302} \u223c {\u00fb \u2212 2\u03c0, v\u0302 + 2\u03c0} .\n\n(2.11)\n\nOn the cylindrical boundary of AdS3 (\u03c1 \u2192 \u221e), d\u00fb and dv\u0302 become null directions. Thus the\ntwo chiral Virasoro algebras of the dual conformal field theory are associated to asymptotic\nreparameterizations \u00fb \u2192 f (\u00fb) and v\u0302 \u2192 g(v\u0302).\nSince the horizon is located at \u03c1 \u2192 \u2212\u221e, we take the near horizon limit\ne2\u03c10 l\nv=\nv\u0302,\nr+\n\nr+\nl\n, v + 2\u03c0 e2\u03c10 } (\u03c10 \u2192 \u2212\u221e)\nl\nr+\n(2.12)\nwhile keeping r, u, v and r+ fixed.4 (See [7] for the first discussion of this limit.)

The\ngenerator of this discrete group sits inside the SL(2, R)L subgroup of the initial SL(2, R)L \u00d7\nSL(2, R)R isometry group of AdS3 [7, 8].

In fact, this geometry is precisely the self-dual orbifold of\nCoussaert and Henneaux [10]. The present coordinate system covers only part of the global\nspacetime described in [8, 10].\nSince (2.13) is asymptotically locally AdS3 , we expect the dual field theory to still be a two\ndimensional conformal field theory, but defined on a boundary null cylinder. To understand\nwhat that means, we can follow [8] and regulate the CFT by cutting off the self-dual orbifold\nat a fixed, large radius. Following the usual AdS/CFT reasoning, this implements a UV\ncutoff in the field theory. We will remove the cutoff by sending r \u2192 \u221e. At any fixed r, the\nmetric (2.13) is conformal to\nds2 = du2 \u2212 e2r du dv\n(2.19)\n\nNow consider a standard cylinder with its usual Cartesian metric ds2 = \u2212dt20 + d\u03c620 and\n{\u03c60 , t0 } \u223c {\u03c60 \u2212 \u03b2, t0 }.

As r \u2192 \u221e the boost becomes infinite, precisely realizing the procedure\ndefined by Seiberg [23] for realizing the Discrete Light Cone Quantization (DLCQ) of a field\ntheory. In Sec. 3 we will show that following the usual kinematics of DLCQ, only one chiral\nsector of the CFT dual to AdS3 will survive at finite energies.\nWe can also see the latter by directly examining the near-horizon limit (2.12). Acting in\nthe CFT dual to AdS3 , the near horizon limit of the extremal BTZ black hole focuses in on\nenergies so low that they lie below the black hole mass gap, thus eliminating all non-extremal\ndynamics [7] (also see [6]). This will isolate one chiral sector (the left-movers), since nonextremal, finite energy excitations necessarily involve excitations of the right-movers also.\nExplicitly, the infinite rescaling in the coordinate v\u0302 relates translations as\n\u2202v \u223c e\u22122\u03c10 \u2202v\u0302 .\n\n(2.23)\n\nThus, recalling the \u2202v\u0302 is the right-moving Hamiltonian in the CFT dual to AdS3 , any finiteenergy right-moving excitation, i.e. any excitation |si with \u2202v\u0302 |si = (L0 \u2212 c/24)|si =\n6 0, will\nbe infinitely blue shifted in the Hamiltonian \u2202v that is well defined in the \u03c10 \u2192 \u2212\u221e limit.\nIn other words, we should only be keeping the states satisfying\n\u2202v\u0302 |si = (L0 \u2212 c/24)|si = 0\n\n(2.24)\n\nwhich are the ground states in the right-moving sector.\nWe can also directly follow how the near-horizon limit (2.12) acts on the left and right\nmoving Virasoro generators of the CFT dual to AdS3 . These generators are\nLn \u2212\n\n\u2202\nc\n\u03b4n,0 = einv\u0302 ,\n24\n\u2202v\u0302\n\nL\u0304n \u2212\n\nc\u0304\n\u2202\n\u03b4n,0 = ein\u00fb\n.\n24\n\u2202 \u00fb\n\n(2.25)\n\nAs \u03c10 \u2192 \u2212\u221e in the near-horizon limit (2.12), it is evident that L\u0304n are essentially unchanged\nwhile the Ln annihilate all the finite energy states because of the condition (2.24).\n\n3\n\nDLCQ of a 2d CFT is a chiral CFT\n\nIn the previous section we reviewed how the near-horizon geometry of extremal BTZ is dual\nto the DLCQ of a 2d CFT. We now examine how such theories are quantized.

These are related to the eigenvalues of\nthe standard operators L0 , L\u03040 used in radial quantization on the plane by L\u03040 = h + n and\nL0 = h. We will assume that the 2d CFT is non-singular, and therefore that the spectrum\nis discrete.\nFollowing Seiberg [23], consider a boost with rapidity \u03b3\nu\u2032 \u2192 e\u03b3 u\u2032 ,\n\nv \u2032 \u2192 e\u2212\u03b3 v \u2032 .\n\n(3.4)\n\nThe boost leaves metric (3.1) invariant.6 However the identifications are now\n{u\u2032, v \u2032 } \u223c {u\u2032 \u2212 2\u03c0Re\u03b3 , v \u2032 + 2\u03c0Re\u2212\u03b3 } .\n\n(3.5)\n\nWe want to match the boundary structure appearing in the boundary of the near horizon\ngeometry with the DLCQ of the starting boundary cylinder. To do so, consider the limit \u03b3 \u2192\n\u221e with R e\u03b3 fixed. This describes a null cylinder geometry with metric ds2 = \u2212du\u2032 dv \u2032 and\nu\u2032 a compact null direction. The same infinite boost was presented in different coordinates\nin (2.20) \u2013 (2.22). However, notice that since v \u2032 \u2192 e\u2212\u03b3 v \u2032 = e\u2212\u03b3 (t + \u03c6) and 0 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 2\u03c0 R,\nas \u03b3 \u2192 \u221e any finite changes in v \u2032 come from changes in t. Thus, in the limit, dv \u2032 \u221d dt\nand ds2 = \u2212du\u2032 dv \u2032 \u2248 \u2212e\u2212\u03b3 du\u2032 dt which is conformal to the dominant piece of the metric in\n(2.22).\nMore explicitly, the periodicities of the boundary coordinates under the limit \u03b3 \u2192 \u221e\nwith R\u2212 \u2261 R e\u03b3 fixed are\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u2032 \u0013 \u0012 \u2032 \u0013 \u0012\n\u0012 \u0013 \u0012 \u0013 \u0012\n2\u03c0R\u2212\nu\nu\n2\u03c0R\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n(3.6)\n+\n\u223c\n\u2212infinite boost \u2192\n+\n\u223c\n2\u03c0R\u2212 e\u22122\u03b3\nv\u2032\nv\u2032\n0\nt\nt\nWe can now identify {u\u2032, v \u2032 } with the lightcone boundary coordinates of AdS3 in (2.12) via\nu\u2032 = u(l/r+ )R\u2212 and v \u2032 = v(r+ /l)R\u2212 . Then, comparing (2.12) and (3.6), it is evident that\nthe action of the near horizon limit on u, v precisely reproduces the identifications induced\nby the infinite boost in DLCQ. Thus, from this perspective also, the dual to the near-horizon\ngeometry of the extremal BTZ black hole should be the DLCQ of the 1+1 dimensional CFT\ndual to AdS3 .\nBecause of the kinematics of the DLCQ boosts,\n\u0010\n\u0010\nc \u0011 e\u2212\u03b3\nc \u0011 e\u03b3\nv\u2032\nu\u2032\nP = h+n\u2212\n,\nP = h\u2212\n.\n24 R\n24 R\n\n(3.7)\n\n\u2032\n\nKeeping P u (momentum along v \u2032 ) finite in the \u03b3 \u2192 \u221e limit requires h = c/24. This leads\nto\ne\u2212\u03b3\nn\n\u2032\nPv = n *\n=\n.\n(3.8)\nR\nR\u2212\n\nThus the DLCQ limit (3.7) freezes the right moving sector. Equivalently, it generates an\ninfinite energy gap in this sector, while the gap in the left-moving sector (whose energy is\n6\n\nIn our previous analysis the cylinder in coordinates (2.20) was boosted but also reparameterized \u2013 this\nis why the metric transformed to (2.21).\n\n7\n\n\f\u2032\n\nmeasured by P v ) is kept finite. All physical finite energy states in this limit only carry\nmomentum along the compact null direction u\u2032 . Therefore, the DLCQ \u03b3 \u2192 \u221e limit defines\na Hilbert space H\nH = {|anythingiL \u2297 |c/24iR } .\n(3.9)\nIt is worth noting that the extremal D1-D5-p black hole (whose near horizon limit is\nthe BTZ black hole) is precisely dual to states of this form with the right movers in the RR\nground state, and the left movers in a highly excited state the statistical degeneracy of which\nexplains the black hole entropy [24].\nSince the spectrum of the DLCQ theory is chiral we might wonder what remains in this\nlimit of the Virasoro algebra of the CFT we started with. Denoting the right moving Virasoro\ngenerators by Lm , all states Lm | c/24i (m < 0) have infinite energy in the DLCQ limit, since\ntheir action always changes the right-moving energy. Explicitly, consider the generators\nLq \u223c eiqv\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2202\n,\n\u2202v \u2032\n\nL\u0304p \u223c eipu\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2202\n,\n\u2202u\u2032\n\n(3.10)\n\nwith L0 \u2212 c/24, L\u03040 \u2212 c/24 being generators of translations along v \u2032 and u\u2032 respectively. After\nthe boost (3.4) the quantization conditions for p, q become:\nq=\n\nk 2\u03b3\nk\n=\ne ,\n\u2212\u03b3\nRe\nR\u2212\n\np=m*\n\n1\nm\n=\n,\n\u03b3\nRe\nR\u2212\n\nk, m \u2208 Z.\n\n(3.11)\n\nThus, there is a single copy of the Virasoro algebra, generated by L\u0304p , which survives the\nlimit. This is acting on the left movers, as expected from the spectrum defining the Hilbert\nspace of the theory. Notice the generators of this algebra are acting on the compact direction\nof the DLCQ null cylinder.\nSummary: The DLCQ of a non-singular 2d CFT freezes the right moving sector to its\nground states | c/24i while keeping the full left moving sector. Hence, the DLCQ limit gives\na chiral 2d CFT with the same central charge as the original one. Applied to the BTZ\nblack hole (Sec. 2), we learn that the near-horizon geometry of extremal BTZ is dual to one\nchiral sector of the 2d CFT with central charge c = 3l/2G3 that is dual to AdS3 gravity. The\nsurviving chiral sector is in the state in which it was placed to realize the dual to an extremal\nblack hole, namely a thermal state at a temperature TL = TDLCQ = R\u2212 /(2\u03c0), corresponding\nto the left-moving thermal state | c/24i \u2297 | T = R\u2212 /2\u03c0i in the Hilbert space of the CFT dual\nto AdS3 .\n\n4\n\nAsymptotic symmetries and the chiral Virasoro algebra\n\nIn the AdS/CFT correspondence, the isometries of spacetime manifest themselves as global\nsymmetries of the dual field theory, and physical states are organized in representations of\nthe isometry group. For this reason, various authors [8, 25, 26] have considered how the\nphysical states of fields in the near-horizon BTZ geometry (2.13) or (2.15) transform under\nthe SL(2, R) \u00d7 U(1) isometry group. Now recall that the DLCQ analysis of the dual field\n8\n\n\ftheory in the previous section showed that the physical states of this theory must live in\na chiral CFT. It would have been natural to expect that the SL(2, R) isometries provide\nthe global part of the associated Virasoro algebra. The surprise is that this is not the\ncase. Specifically, the SL(2, R) isometries are associated to reparameterizations of the noncompact coordinate v on the boundary, while the physical states only carry momentum along\nthe compact null direction u on which only the U(1) part of the isometry group acts. Thus,\nAdS/CFT is telling us that physical states cannot be charged under the SL(2, R) isometry\ngroup associated to the AdS2 base in (2.15).\nWhy would a consistent quantum theory of gravity around the near-horizon BTZ background (2.15) require the absence of excitations in the AdS2 base of this geometry? Perhaps\nbecause any such fluctuations would cause the space to \"fragment\" leading to the appearance\nof multiple boundaries to the spacetime [14]. In the next section we will compactify (2.15)\nand examine its stability to excitations in the AdS2 base. Below we will simply accept the\nlesson from the analysis of the dual DLCQ field theory and implement boundary conditions\nfor the spacetime that preserve only the predicted spectrum.\nBoundary conditions: To this end, we will follow the asymptotic symmetry group analysis\nof Brown and Henneaux [11] by identifying the boundary conditions for \"allowed\" metric\nfluctuations close to the spacetime boundary. First recall the Brown-Henneaux boundary\nconditions for AdS3 . In the \u00fb, v\u0302, r coordinates [22], where the background AdS3 metric takes\n2\nthe form ds2 = l2 ( drr2 \u2212 2r 2 d\u00fbdv\u0302) these boundary conditions at large r are [11]\n\u03b4g\u00fb\u00fb \u223c \u03b4gv\u0302v\u0302 \u223c \u03b4g\u00fbv\u0302 \u223c O(1),\n\n\u03b4grr \u223c O(\n\n1\n),\nr4\n\n\u03b4gr\u00fb \u223c \u03b4grv\u0302 \u223c O(\n\n1\n).\nr3\n\n(4.1)\n\nOrder one fluctuations in \u03b4g\u00fb\u00fb , \u03b4gv\u0302v\u0302 correspond to normalizable modes in the dual 2d CFT\nand these may be chosen arbitrarily. For example, writing a generic BTZ black hole in the\n\u00fb, v\u0302 coordinates, the constant parts of g\u00fb\u00fb and gv\u0302v\u0302 determine the ADM mass and angular\nmomentum of the black hole (2.9). Thus, order O(1) fluctuations in \u03b4g\u00fb\u00fb , \u03b4gv\u0302v\u0302 correspond\nto changing the mass and angular momentum in the dual 2d CFT. A general deformation of\n\u03b4g\u00fb\u00fb , \u03b4gv\u0302v\u0302 would be non-extremal and would thus excite both chiral sectors of the dual CFT.\nBy contrast, we want to restrict to extremal excitations. Recalling the form of BTZ metric\n(2.9), one may easily observe that imposing the extremality condition L0 = c/24 requires a\nmore stringent boundary condition on the variations in gv\u0302v\u0302 . The arguments of Sec. 2 and 3\nfor taking the DLCQ limit and in particular (3.7) then suggest that we should replace the\nboundary condition on gv\u0302v\u0302 by\n1\n\u03b4gv\u0302v\u0302 \u223c O( 2 ) .\n(4.2)\nr\nThe remainder of the Brown-Henneaux boundary conditions in (4.1) can be kept intact.\nFurther analysis shows that these are forming a set of consistent boundary conditions. In\nfact this set is equivalent to choosing a subset of (4.1) that preserve the null nature of the\nnon-compact coordinate v (up to transformations which are trivial at large r).\nAsymptotic Symmetry Group: The asymptotic symmetry group (ASG) of a spacetime is the set of symmetry transformations (diffeomorphisms) which preserve the boundary\nconditions modulo the set of diffeomorphisms the generators of which vanish (reduce to a\nboundary integral) after implementation of the boundary conditions. Equipped with the\n9\n\n\fabove boundary conditions we can compute the ASG for the case of the near horizon extremal BTZ or the self-dual orbifold of AdS3 . We seek diffeomorphisms (vector fields \u03b6)\nwhose action on the metric (Lie derivative L\u03b6 g) generates metric fluctuations compatible\n0\n0\nwith the above boundary conditions. More mathematically, if g\u03b1\u03b2 = g\u03b1\u03b2\n+ \u03b4g\u03b1\u03b2 , where g\u03b1\u03b2\nstands for the asymptotic metric, then one is looking for vector fields \u03b6 satisfying\n(L\u03b6 g)\u03b1\u03b2 \u223c \u03b4g\u03b1\u03b2 ,\n\n(4.3)\n\nwhere the symbol \u223c stands for same order of magnitude in the large r expansion sense.\n\nSince our boundary conditions are closely related but more restrictive than those of\nBrown-Henneaux [11], we can use their explicit analysis of the generators of the asymptotic\nsymmetry group and simply impose the additional constraint on \u03b4gvv (4.2) on them. The\nallowed diffeomorphisms are\n1 \u2032\u2032\ng (v) + O(r \u22124 )\n2\n2r\n1\n\u03b6 v = 2g(v) + 2 f \u2032\u2032 (u) + O(r \u22124 ),\n2r\n\u03b6 r = \u2212r (f \u2032 (u) + g \u2032(v)) + O(r \u22121 )\n\n\u03b6 u = 2f (u) +\n\ng \u2032\u2032\u2032 (v) = 0\n\n=\u21d2\n\ng = A + B v + C v2 .\n\n(4.4a)\n(4.4b)\n(4.4c)\n(4.5)\n\nHere, the connection to the Brown-Henneaux diffeomorphisms is made explicit: the diffeomorphisms generated by \u03b6 = \u03b6 \u03b1 \u2202\u03b1 of (4.4) are exactly those of Brown-Henneaux [11] and\nthe constraint \u03b4gvv = O( r12 ) is implemented by (4.5). One set of allowed diffeomorphisms\nis specified by a periodic function f (u) = f (u + 2\u03c0). The analysis of generators of these\ndiffeomorphisms follows directly from those of Brown and Henneaux and they lead to a chiral Virasoro algebra at central charge c = 3l/2G3 (2.4). 7 The remaining three parameter\nfamily of diffeomorphisms in (4.5) describes the SL(2, R) isometries of the self-dual orbifold.\nThe isometries of the original extremal black holes were just a U(1) \u00d7 U(1). In that case\na Brown-Henneaux analysis with the extremal constraint would have also yielded (4.4) with\nthe constraint g \u2032\u2032\u2032 = 0. However, in the original geometry g has to be a periodic function\nwhich restricts the solutions to the constraint to g = A only. The process of taking the near\nhorizon limit led to an identification in u alone, and thus, g need not be periodic, allowing\nthe three parameter solution above. The isometry generators that appear in this way, are\nnot simply related to the SL(2, R) generated by L0 , L\u00b11 (2.25).\n\nAdS2 quantum gravity and dual chiral CFTs\n\n5\n\nConsider the two-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theory with a negative cosmological\nconstant:\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\n2\nl2 3\u03c8\nl\n2 \u221a\n\u03c8\n\u03bc\u03bd\nd x \u2212g e (R + 2 ) \u2212 e F\u03bc\u03bd F\n(5.1)\nS=\n8G3\nl\n4\n7\n\nOur analysis here suggests that the Left and Right CFT's introduced in [27] may be identical. This\npoint deserves further investigation.\n\n10\n\n\fwhere F\u03bc\u03bd is the U(1) field strength. This action has an AdS2 solution with curvature\nR = \u2212 l82 , constant \u03c8 and constant electric flux :\nds2 = \u2212\n\nl2\n(\u2212dt2 + dr 2 ),\nr2\n\nFtr =\n\n2Q\n,\nr2\n\ne\u2212\u03c8 = Q .\n\n(5.2)\n\nThis action may be obtained from the dimensional reduction of the 3d Einstein-Hilbert\naction with 3d Newton constant G3 and cosmological constant \u22121/l2 via restriction to the\nmassless sector of the Kaluza-Klein tower. 8 Likewise the reduction of the near-horizon BTZ\ngeometry (2.15) to two dimensions is precisely (5.2). The radius of the extremal BTZ horizon\nbecomes lQ. The action (5.1) has another two parameter family of solutions in which \u03c8 is\nnot a constant [7] \u2013 these lift to generic BTZ black holes.\nBecause of this connection between two and three dimensions, we expect that quantum\ngravity around the background (5.2) is dual to a subsector of the DLCQ chiral CFT that\nis developed in Sec. 2 and 3, and is only fully consistent when embedded in string theory\nwith all the resulting additional degrees of freedom. The electric field strength Q is related\nto the DLCQ compactification scale R\u2212 in (3.6) while the central charge is related to the 2d\nNewton constant: c = 3l/(2G3 ) = 3/(4\u03c0G2).\nQuantum gravity in the AdS2 background (5.2) was explored in [25] from the perspective\nof the spacetime conformal field theory, and in [26] from the perspective of the boundary\nstress tensor. Both of the papers consider spectra including states charged under the SL(2, R)\nisometry group of AdS2 , and analyze a Virasoro algebra which includes this SL(2, R). However, as shown in previous sections, a consistent quantum theory of gravity in this background\nshould not have any states charged under the isometry group. The reason for this is that\nexcitations supported in AdS2 back-react strongly and can modify the asymptotic structure\nof the spacetime [14].\nTo see this, let us write the two dimensional metric in a gauge in which the metric is\nconformally flat\n+ \u2212\nds2 = e2\u03c6(\u03c3 ,\u03c3 ) d\u03c3 + d\u03c3 \u2212 , 0 \u2264 \u03c3 \u00b1 \u2264 \u03c0 ,\n(5.3)\nand consider the variation of the action (5.1) with respect to the 2d metric. We find\n\u2207+ \u2207+ e\u03c8 = 8\u03c0G2 T++\n\n(5.4)\n\nand similarly for the \u2212\u2212 component. If we regard (5.1) as arising from compactification of a\nthree dimensional theory, besides the contributions from \u03c8 and the gauge field, we can also\ninclude all contributions of massive Kaluza-Klein modes in T++ . We may now follow the\ndiscussion in section 2.2 of [14] (see Eqs. (2.16) and (2.17) there). Integrating (5.4) against\ne\u22122\u03c6 d\u03c3 + , we obtain\nZ\n\u22122\u03c6\n\u03c8\n\u22122\u03c6\n\u03c8\n(5.5)\ne \u2202+ e |\u03c3+ =0 \u2212 e \u2202+ e |\u03c3+ =\u03c0 = \u22128\u03c0G2 d\u03c3 + e\u22122\u03c6 T++\n8\n\nAn analysis of Schwinger pair creation of charged particles in AdS2 in the presence of a constant electric\nfield was performed in [28]. A bound between the mass of particle excitations and the background electric\nfield was derived to ensure the stability of these backgrounds. This bound is satisfied in supersymmetric\nAdS2 \u00d7 S 2 spacetimes and is also saturated for the two dimensional vacuum solution discussed here.\n\n11\n\n\fand similarly for T\u2212\u2212 . Assuming a null energy condition (T++ \u2265 0), any state with nonvanishing T++ requires at least one of the two terms on the left hand side of this equation\nto be non-zero. Since e\u22122\u03c6 vanishes quadratically near the boundary of AdS2 , this implies\nthat e\u03c8 must diverge at one of the AdS2 boundaries. This is inconsistent with the constant\nvalue e\u2212\u03c8 = Q in (5.2), which is related from the three dimensional point of view to the compactification radius. This shows that preserving the boundary conditions requires T++ = 0\nand a similar argument requires T\u2212\u2212 = 0. Thus perturbations cannot have any dependence\non \u03c3 + , \u03c3 \u2212 , as their back-reaction would destroy the boundary of the geometry. The background geometry (5.2) has an SL(2, R) isometry, and if perturbations do not depend on\n\u03c3 + , \u03c3 \u2212 , then the perturbation cannot break the SL(2, R) symmetry either. In other words,\nall degrees of freedom transform trivially under SL(2, R), in agreement with the analysis in\nprevious section.9\nThis argument used the fact that AdS2 has two disconnected boundaries. In Sec. 2\nthe analysis of the CFT dual was carried out in coordinates that only intersected a single\nboundary, but it was shown in [8] that, globally, the self-dual orbifold geometry has two\nboundaries, each of which is a null cylinder carrying a DLCQ of a CFT. To see this, transform\nthe coordinates in (2.15) as\ny = cos \u03c4 cosh z + sinh z\n\n;\n\nv=\n\nsin \u03c4 cosh z\n,\ncos \u03c4 cosh z + sinh z\n\n(5.6)\n\nso that the self-dual orbifold metric becomes\nds2 =\n\n\u0001\nl2\n2\n\u2212 cosh2 z d\u03c4 2 + dz 2 + l2 (du + A\u2032 )\n4\n\n(5.7)\n\nwhere A\u2032 is a gauge field with constant field strength in global AdS2 . This is the global\nself-dual orbifold of [8]. The entire range of v is covered by a finite range of global time \u03c4 .\nThus each patch of the form (2.15) intersects one boundary of the global spacetime at either\nz = \u00b1\u221e.\n\nIn view of this, both the near-horizon limit of extremal BTZ (2.13) and the 3d uplift of\n(5.2) can be regarded globally as dual to two DLCQ CFTs, each giving rise to one chiral theory\n(see [8, 6] for discussion). From this perspective we can presumably view the description of\nthe self-dual orbifold as a thermal state in a single CFT as emerging from tracing over the\nHilbert space living in one of the boundaries. This is in analogy with the usual treatment\nof the eternal BTZ black hole as either an entangled state in two CFTs defined on the two\nboundaries of the geodesically complete spacetime, or as a thermal state in a single CFT\n[31]. The statistical degeneracy of the thermal state in the chiral CFT dual to the spacetime\n(2.15) then measures the area of the familiar Poincare horizon of this coordinate patch (see\n[3] for a similar perspective). One difference between BTZ and the self-dual orbifold is that\nwhile the BTZ boundaries are causally disconnected, a light ray can travel between the\n9\n\nThe fact that AdS2 \"fragments\" in this way has led to the suggestion [14] that the dual of a onedimensional conformal field theory should involve a sum over tree-like geometries with many different asymptotic AdS2 boundaries. While some partial progress has been made in developing this picture [29, 30], it\nis still unclear whether this is the right way to think about AdS2 , or whether it eventually will lead to\nconnection with the fuzzball proposal, and we will not further pursue this possibility in this paper.\n\n12\n\n\ftwo boundaries of the global self-dual orbifold [8]. The possible interactions that this seeds\nbetween the two boundaries have not been studied.\nIn this global context there is another piece of evidence that the AdS2 base of the selfdual orbifold cannot be consistently excited. It was shown in [26] that the most general\nsolution of the dimensional reduction of 3d gravity with a negative cosmological constant in\na particular gauge can be put in the form\n1\ng\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd = d\u03b7 2 \u2212 (h0 (t)e2\u03b7/L + h1 (t)e\u22122\u03b7/L )2 dt2 .\n4\n\n(5.8)\n\nAt the boundary \u03b7 \u2192 \u221e, the boundary metric is determined by h0 (t). One can choose\na coordinate t such that h0 = 1. The subleading behavior is determined by h1 (t). The\ndiffeomorphisms that preserve this gauge and leave h0 unchanged were determined by [26].\nHowever it turns out that while these are normalizable deformations of the boundary at\n\u03b7 \u2192 +\u221e, they are not normalizable deformations at the other boundary \u03b7 \u2192 \u2212\u221e \u2013 i.e.\nthey change h1 . In fact, there are no deformations at all which both preserve the gauge and\nare normalizable at both boundaries, except the isometries. This again suggests that it is\nnot possible to deform AdS2 without disrupting the spacetime boundary.\n\n6\n\nExtremal Kerr black hole and its dual chiral CFT\n\nThe extremal 4d Kerr black hole is given by\n\u00112 sin2 \u03b8 \u0010\n\u00112 R 2\n\u2206 \u0010\n2\n2\n2\n2\n(r\u0302 + a )d\u03c6\u0302 \u2212 adt\u0302 +\ndr\u0302 2 + R2 d\u03b82 ,\nds = \u2212 2 dt\u0302 \u2212 a sin \u03b8d\u03c6\u0302 +\nR\nR2\n\u2206\n\n(6.1)\n\nwhere\nR2 = r\u0302 2 + a2 cos2 \u03b8,\n\n\u2206 = (r\u0302 \u2212 a)2 .\n\n(6.2)\n\nIts ADM mass and angular momentum are function of the horizon size a\nM = a,\n\nJ=\n\na2\n.\nG4\n\n(6.3)\n\nIn the quantum theory, J is quantized (to half integers) in units of ~.

If \u039b and \u03a9 were constants this would be precisely the\nself-dual orbifold of (2.15) times a circle. Indeed, as emphasized in [12], constant \u03b8 slices look\nlike squashed self-dual orbifolds. The coordinates in (6.6) cover only part of the spacetime,\nwith a boundary at r \u2192 \u221e \u2013 globally, like the self-dual orbifold, there are two boundaries.\nOne sees similar squashed geometries with AdS2 and AdS3 factors in decoupling limits of\nnear-extremal black holes in anti-de Sitter space [15, 16, 17]. (Also see [33, 34, 35].)\nThe Kerr black hole is invariant under time and angular \u03c6\u0302 translations. This isometry\ngroup is enhanced to SL(2, R) \u00d7 U(1) in the near horizon, just as in the self-dual orbifold.\nThe U(1) is generated by \u2202\u03c6 , whereas the SL(2, R) acts both on the AdS2 subspace and\nalong the fiber to preserve the form of d\u03c6 + rdt [12].\nIn [12], the asymptotic symmetry group preserving certain boundary conditions for the\nfluctuations of the NHEK was calculated. The corresponding diffeomorphisms they found\nwere of the form\n\u03b6\u03bb = \u03bb(\u03c6)\u2202\u03c6 \u2212 r\u03bb(\u03c6)\u2032\u2202r .\n(6.8)\nThese generate a chiral Virasoro algebra. In [12] it was proposed that this Virasoro algebra\nshould be understood as the symmetry group of a chiral 2d CFT dual to quantum gravity\naround the near horizon Kerr geometry. The central charge of this chiral CFT was computed\nto be\ncExt. Kerr = 12J .\n(6.9)\nThe NHEK is then associated with a thermal state of the chiral 2d CFT at temperature TN HEK = 1/2\u03c0. Upon applying the Cardy formula for the entropy of 2d CFTs, the\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy of the extremal Kerr black hole (6.4) is reproduced. The consistency of the boundary conditions proposed in [12] required the vanishing of the charge of\nthe U(1)\u03c4 \u2208 SL(2, R), i.e.\nER = 0\n(6.10)\nin the notation used in [12], for all physical states. Thus, like for the self-dual orbifold, there\nare no physical excitations of the AdS2 factor in the geometry. The ER = 0 condition acts\nlike the restriction to extremality in the BTZ black hole that we studied in Sec. 2.\nThe analogies between the Kerr-CFT construction [12] and the analysis of the self-dual\norbifold in previous sections suggests that chiral CFT of [12] is the DLCQ of an ordinary two\ndimensional conformal field theory. Ideally, we would like to find a consistent Kaluza-Klein\nreduction of gravity in the NHEK geometry to the three-dimensional self-dual orbifold. As a\nfirst step, we make a connection between the NHEK geometry and 3d gravity with a negative\ncosmological constant. For the NHEK geometry we consider then the four dimensional metric\nreduction ansatz:\n\u0002\n\u0001\n\u0003\nds2 = L2 \u03a92 \u2212\u2202\u03c3 \u03b2(t, \u03c3) \u2212dt2 + d\u03c3 2 + d\u03b82 + \u039b2 (d\u03c6 + \u03b2(t, \u03c3)dt)2 ,\n(6.11)\n14\n\n\fwhere \u03a92 = (1 + cos2 \u03b8)/2 and \u039b = 2 sin \u03b8/(1 + cos2 \u03b8). The equation of motion derived\nfor \u03b2 using this ansatz and the four dimensional Einstein equation without a cosmological\nconstant is identical to the equation of motion obtained from the three-dimensional ansatz\nds2 =\n\n\u0003\n\u0001\nl2 \u0002\n\u2212\u2202\u03c3 \u03b2(t, \u03c3) \u2212dt2 + d\u03c3 2 + (d\u03c6 + \u03b2(t, \u03c3)dt)2 .\n4\n\n(6.12)\n\nand Einstein's equation with a cosmological constant\nR3\u03bc\u03bd +\n\n2\ng3\u03bc\u03bd = 0.\nl2\n\n(6.13)\n\nHere R3 is the Ricci tensor computed for the 3d metric. Although this obviously does not\nshow that there should exist a Kaluza-Klein reduction from four to three dimensions which\nreduces the NHEK geometry to the self-dual orbifold of AdS3 , it does show that the two\ntheories share some dynamics.\nWe can also derive the central charge derived in [12] from the 4d NHEK geometry, by\nmatching parameters with the three-dimensional reduction ansatz. To do this, note first that\nthe above 3d equation of motion can be obtained from the Lagrangian\nL3 =\n\np\n\n\u2212 det g3 (R3 +\n\n2\n),\nl2\n\n(6.14)\n\nwhich describes 3d gravity in the presence of a negative cosmological constant. The 3d Newton constant is then computed by integrating over the compact direction \u03b8 in our reduction\nansatz\nR\u03c0\n2L2 0 d\u03b8 \u03a92 \u039b\n4L2\n1\n=\n=\n.\n(6.15)\nG3\nG4 l\nG4 l\nThus the 3d action is\nZ\n1\nS3 =\nd3 x L3 ,\n(6.16)\n16\u03c0G3\nNote that its vacuum solution is an AdS3 with radius RAdS = l. Since L2 = 2G4 J, using the\nBrown-Henneaux formula for the central charge, we have\nc=\n\n3RAdS\n= 12J .\n2G3\n\n(6.17)\n\nThis matches (6.9). We earlier showed that the AdS3 central charge also matches the central\ncharge of the chiral CFT that is dual to self-dual orbifold.\nThis suggests the proposed chiral 2d CFT dual to extremal Kerr [12] is the DLCQ of a\n2d CFT with the following identifications: (a) The DLCQ compactification radius R\u2212 is an\narbitrary physical scale and has been set equal to one in the Kerr/CFT analysis [12], (b)\nThe ER = 0 condition in [12] is mapped to L0 = c/24 DLCQ condition, (c) The extremal\nKerr ADM angular momentum J is equal to the light-cone momentum P + of the DLCQ\ndescription.\nOne should note that identifying the chiral 2d CFT duals proposed for extremal black\nholes [12, 13] as the DLCQ of a 2d CFT also explains why we can use Cardy's formula to\n15\n\n\fcount the number of states. If we only knew that the states had to form representations of a\nsingle Virasoro algebra, we would not be able to use modular invariance, and unitarity alone\ndoes not determine the asymptotic growth of the number of states. Still, there are to our\nknowledge no general statements about the asymptotic growth of the number of states of\nthe form |c/24iR \u2297 |anythingi in an arbitrary CFT. If the left-movers are Ramond ground\nstates, and it is a theory with supersymmetry, one can estimate the number of states of this\nform using the elliptic genus and its modular properties [36], and it would be interesting to\nestablish similar results for more general CFT's.\nWhile our results have provided some evidence that DLCQ of a CFT is dual to the\nnear-horizon extremal Kerr, it would have been more satisfactory to have a consistent and\ncomplete reduction of 4d gravity with NHEK boundary conditions [12] to 3d gravity with a\ncosmological constant. In a similar setting where squashed AdS3 factors appear in a decoupling limit of R-charged black holes in AdS4 and AdS5 , progress towards such a reduction\nhas been made [15, 16, 17].\n\n7\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this paper we have shown that the near-horizon limit of the extremal BTZ black hole,\nwhich leads to the so-called self-dual orbifold geometry, is dual to the DLCQ of a non-chiral 2d\nCFT, which is a chiral 2d CFT with the same central charge. We have also provided evidence\nthat various \"chiral CFTs\" that have appeared in the literature as dual CFTs to extremal\nblack holes should really be thought of as DLCQ of ordinary two-dimensional CFTs. This,\namong other things, justifies the use of Cardy formula to account for the extremal black hole\nentropy using this chiral CFT duals. It would be desirable to develop this picture in more\ndetail. In particular, it would be interesting to study correlation functions in the DLCQ\ntheory and the corresponding bulk-boundary dictionary. Another outstanding problem is\nto establish more rigorously that generic extremal black holes, upon taking a near-horizon\nlimit, are indeed dual (once suitable boundary conditions are imposed) to the DLCQ of a\nconformal field theory. If this is indeed the case, one would expect that the parent 2d CFT\nof the DLCQ theory might also have a string theoretic realization, e.g. in the form of a\nwarped AdS3 solution of string theory. In other words, one might seek some sort of map\nfrom extremal black hole solutions to AdS3 solutions. We have seen hints of such a map in\n[15, 16, 17], but whether it exists in the general case is unclear.\nOne curiosity about the self-dual orbifold geometry is that it is dual to thermal state in\na DLCQ CFT. The ground state of the DLCQ theory does not appear to have a bona fide\ngeometric dual.10 This is unlike AdS3 gravity with a standard cylindrical boundary where\nthe ground state describes empty AdS and thermal states describe black holes. This seems\nto be a general feature of gauge-gravity duality for DLCQ field theories [37].\n10\n\nSpecifically, it is not dual to a very near horizon limit of the M = 0 BTZ black hole as one can explicitly\ncheck.\n\n16\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank John McGreevy, Bindusar Sahoo, Gary Horowitz and Matthew\nRoberts for useful discussions.
