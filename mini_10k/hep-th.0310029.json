It has\ntherefore been a constant theme to try to identify geometrically the features of the conformal\nfield theory, as has been done most notably with boundary conditions on the worldsheet and\nD-branes. Another prominent example is that of orbifolding (see for example [1], [2], [3]). For\ninstance, it has been shown in [4] that upon orbifolding flat space by some abelian, finite group\n\u0393 one can include phases in the twisted sectors of the theory, which correspond geometrically\nto introducing a non-trivial two-form field B, called discrete torsion. In this note we extend\nthis study to a class of orbifolds of curved (bosonic) backgrounds.\nWe were motivated by the fact that the CFT describing string propagation in lens spaces\nLn = SU(2)/Zn , where the left SU(2) symmetry is preserved, is an element in a family of\ntheories corresponding to a particular choice of a parameter also called (algebraic) discrete\ntorsion [5], [6]. The question arose as to whether a different choice of algebraic discrete torsion\nwould also have a geometrical interpretation. It is our goal here to describe the geometry of\nthis family of CFTs.\nTo answer this question we will study more general orbifolds M = G/\u0393 of compact, simple,\nsimply connected groups G by abelian, finite subgroups \u0393 (whose action will be specified later).\n\u0393 lies in some maximal torus of G and is of the form \u0393 = Zn1 \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 Znr where r is the rank of\nG. Depending on the action of \u0393, the quotient space may be smooth or have some singularities.\nIf G/\u0393 is smooth, it inherits the left translational invariant metric g and three-form H from\nthe covering G. The quotienting can therefore be implemented on the WZW model describing\nG at some level k. Recall however that, for integrality of the Wess-Zumino term, the field H\nis quantized, H \u2208 H 3 (G, kZ), so that it describes a (1-)gerbe over G [7]. In order that the\nintegrality of the Wess-Zumino term be preserved by the quotient, all ni must divide k. This\nis not a restriction, since in comparing CFT with geometry one takes the semi-classical limit\nof k large. On the other hand, the theory may depend on the choice of connection B for the\nH-field [8].\nWe show that these same CFTs can be constructed using the simple current formalism [5]1 .\nThis is a powerful tool which has been systematically studied for over a decade; we briefly\nreview it in section 2, and in particular we describe the algebraic discrete torsion. In section 3\nwe review the construction of gerbes with connections on quotient spaces and show how they\nallow for inequivalent choices of B fields. Using the K\u00fcnneth formula we compare this freedom\nto the choice of CFT discrete torsion in the case of orbifolds of WZW models. We construct\nthe partition functions for these quotient spaces and match them to the modular invariants\nderived in the section 2; we find that part of the discrete torsion corresponds to the choice of\naction of the subgroup, yielding different quotient spaces, and another part corresponds to the\ndifferent choices of B field.\nFor some values of the discrete torsion, the correspondence above associates CFTs to target\nspaces G/\u0393 having fixed points. We expect that these singularities are regulated by string\ntheory in some way, but we leave the determination of the resolved geometry for later work.\nWe conclude with some remarks on T-duality and D-branes on these spaces.\n1\n\nIn fact, the case of non-abelian \u0393 can in principle be studied with tools introduced just recently in [9] which\nare beyond the scope of this paper.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nThe CFT description of discrete torsion\n\nWe start by building a rational conformal field theory corresponding to the sigma-model on the\nquotient G/\u0393 with \u0393 acting on the right. We shall use the simple current formalism [5], which\nwe briefly review now. Given a rational CFT with chiral algebra gk , simple currents are those\nprimary fields which have the property that they have an inverse under the fusion product,\ndenoted \u22c6. A ubiquitous example is the identity field itself. Furthermore, since the theory is\nrational, for any simple current J there is a positive integer nJ , called the order of J, such that\nJ nJ = J \u22c6 . . . \u22c6 J is the identity field. The set of such primaries forms an abelian finite group\nfor the fusion product, which is called the center of the theory. We are interested in those\nsimple currents which have trivial monodromy around all other fields, since these encode some\n\"bosonic\" symmetry of the theory. Such simple currents form the effective center Z, which\nis equivalently defined as the subgroup of the center consisting of those simple currents J for\nwhich nJ \u2206J \u2208 Z (where \u2206J is the conformal weight of J).\nThe partition function of a CFT is a bilinear in the characters of the irreducible highest\nweight representations\nX\n(2.1)\nZ\u03bb\u03bb\u2032 \u03c7\u03bb \u03c7\u0304\u03bb\u2032\nZ=\n\u03bb,\u03bb\u2032 irreps\n\nIt is said to be of simple current type if Z\u03bb\u03bb\u2032 is non-zero only for \u03bb\u2032 = J \u22c6 \u03bb for some primary\n\u03bb and some J \u2208 Z. The consistent modular invariant partition functions of this type were\nclassified in [5], and they constitute the vast majority of known rational CFTs.\nTo build a modular invariant of simple current type one begins by choosing a simple current\ngroup G \u2282 Z. Since G is a finite abelian group, it is of the form G = Zn1 \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 Znq . Then,\npicking a set of generators Ji for G defines a q \u00d7 q symmetric matrix of relative monodromies\nRij = QJi (Jj ) = \u2206(Ji ) + \u2206(Jj ) \u2212 \u2206(Ji \u22c6 Jj ). We define a q \u00d7 q matrix X whose entries\nare defined modulo integers and such that its symmetric part is fixed by X + X t = R. Its\nantisymmetric part is constrained by Xij = xij /nij , with xij an integer and nij = gcd(ni , nj ).\nThe antisymmetric part of X is called (algebraic) discrete torsion, and it is parametrized by\nH 2 (G, U(1)) [5]. Given a choice of discrete torsion, the modular invariant is given by\n!\nq\nXX Y\nZ=\n\u03b4Z (QJi (\u03bb) + Xij sj ) \u03c7\u03bb \u03c7\u0304J ~s \u03bb\n(2.2)\n\u03bb\n\nJ ~s \u2208G\n\ni=1\n\nwhere we have written the general element of G as J ~s = \u03a0i Jisi . Here \u03b4Z (a) = 1 if a \u2208 Z and\n0 otherwise. So we see that the discrete torsion affects only the off diagonal (si 6= 0) terms in\nthe modular invariant. The left and right kernels of X determine the extensions of the left and\nright chiral algebras respectively. Therefore, when they are different the modular invariant is\nleft-right asymmetric.\n\nWZW models from Cosets: To describe the G/\u0393 theory we start from the CFT gk /u(1)r \u2297\nu(1)r , with g the Lie algebra of G, since the chiral u(1) symmetries are not broken by the\nquotient (recall that \u0393 is a subgroup of a maximal torus and that the level k must be a multiple\nof the ni ). To get acquainted with the procedure, we first recall how to recover the Gk WZW\n3\n\n\f(charge-conjugation) partition function as a modular invariant of the gk /u(1)r \u2297 u(1)r theory,\nfollowing [10].\nDenote by P the weight lattice of the finite dimensional Lie algebra g and by Q its root\nlattice. From the decomposition of representations of g in terms of those of u(1)r , the characters\nof the irreducible highest weight representations of gk decompose as\nX\nr\n\u03c7g\u039bk (\u03c4, z) =\n\u03c7\u039b,\u03bc (\u03c4 )\u03c7u(1)\n(\u03c4, z)\n(2.3)\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\u2208P/kQ\n\nThe generalized parafermion labels (\u039b, \u03bc) are subject to the selection rule \u039b \u2212 \u03bc \u2208 Q. Furthermore, there are field identifications generated by outer automorphisms \u03c9 of gk which descend\nto outer automorphisms of u(1)r2k .\nThe Gk WZW (charge-conjugation) partition function is a simple current modular invariant\nwith simple current group G \u223c\n= Q/kQ. For concreteness, in the following we shall mainly\nconsider the case gk = su(N + 1)k . In this case the rank r is equal to N and Q = ZN . The\nparafermion primaries are vectors (~\uf6be, m)\n~ which we write in a basis {~\u03bbi } for the weight lattice,\nPN ~\ne.g. ~\uf6be = i=1 ji \u03bbi . The parafermions are subject to the selection rules mi = ji mod 2 and to\nthe field identifications given by (~\uf6be, m)\n~ \u223c (\u03c9~\uf6be, m\n~ + k~\u03bb1 ) with\n!\nX\n\u03c9(~\uf6be) = k \u2212\nji ~\u03bb1 + j1~\u03bb2 + . . . + jN \u22121~\u03bbN\n(2.4)\ni\n\nIn our notations both the parafermion labels mi and the u(1)2k labels, denoted m\u2032i , are defined\nth\nmodulo 2k. The simple current group in this case is G \u223c\nfactor is generated\n= ZN\nk , where the i\n\u2032\n\u2032\nby Ji acting as mi \u2192 mi + 2 together with mi \u2192 mi + 2.\nNow to define the modular invariant (2.2) with simple current group G \u223c\n= ZN\nk we must\nspecify the N \u00d7 N matrix X. For N > 1 this allows for a choice of discrete torsion, i.e. the\nantisymmetric part of X whose entries are constrained to be of the form xij /k, for some integers\nxij . To recover the Gk theory, i.e. to get the combinations of the characters of the form (2.3)\nin the partition function (2.2), we set the xij 's to zero. Other choices of xij 's will yield more\ncomplicated partition functions; in this case it is not clear how to take the semi-classical limit\nof large k, since different scalings of the xij with k yield different partition functions. Therefore,\nit is not evident to assign a geometrical interpretation to non-zero values of these parameters.\nIn this note we will set the xij 's to zero.\nG/\u0393 models from Cosets: The results in the previous paragraph suggest that the simple\ncurrent group leading to the G/\u0393 theory is G \u223c\n= ZN\nk \u00d7\u0393. There may be several groups isomorphic\nto \u0393 \u223c\n= Zn1 \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 ZnN in the effective center Z, but without loss of generality we may assume\nthat the generators of \u0393 act on directions of the maximal torus normal to each other (with\nrespect to the Killing form). That means that the ith generator of \u0393, which we denote Wi ,\ni = 1, . . . , N, acts on the momenta as m\u2032i \u2192 m\u2032i + 2k/ni . leaving all other quantum numbers\ninvariant. Here ni denotes the order of the current Wi , which may be one. Let us now consider\nthe possible discrete torsion. From [5] we know that the (algebraic) discrete torsion for a theory\nwith simple current group G is parametrized by\nD(G) \u2261 H 2 (G, U(1))\n4\n\n(2.5)\n\n\fWe will see in section 3 that for our case2\nH\n\n2\n\n(ZN\nk\n\nN(N\u22121)\n2\n\n\u00d7 \u0393, U(1)) = Zk\n\n\u2295\n\nN\nM\n\nZN\nni \u2295\n\ni=1\n\nM\n\nZgcd(ni ,nj )\n\n(2.6)\n\ni<j\n\nWe can see this more directly by studying the antisymmetric part of the matrix X. For this, a\nword on notation is in order. The matrix X is written on a basis (Ji , Wj ), where i, j = 1, . . . , N.\nSince we want to keep the same index labelling i for both sets of currents J (the ZN\nk generators)\nand W (the \u0393 generators)3 , entries mixing Ji 's will be denoted Xij , entries mixing J's and W 's\nare denoted Yij and entries mixing W 's are denoted Zij . Going back to the discrete torsion\ngroup (2.6), the first factor stands for the xij mentioned in the previous paragraph. Then, to\nthe entries Yij we can add the numbers yij /nj , because all nj divide k. Since the entries of the\nmatrix X are defined modulo integers, the yij are parametrized by \u0393. This accounts for the\nZN\nni factors. Finally, to the entries Zij we may add zij /gcd(ni , nj ), which are parametrized by\nL\ni<j Zgcd(ni ,nj ) .\nSo in our case the formula (2.2) yields for general discrete torsion parameters (yij , zij ) (recall\nwe are setting xij = 0)\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nXX\uf8ec X\n\uf8f7\n\u03c7~\uf6bem(~\nZ(yij , zij ) =\n(2.7)\n\uf8ed\n~ s) \u03c7m\n~ \u2032 (~s) \u03c7\u0304j,w(~\n~ s) \u03c7\u0304w\n~ \u2032 (~s) \uf8f8\n~\uf6be\n\n~s\n\nm,\n~ m\n~ \u2032 (~\ns)\nw,\n~ w\n~ \u2032 (~\ns)\n\n\u0001\nwhere we are writing the general simple current as J ~s = (\u03a0i Jisi ) \u03a0i Wis\u0304i together with ~s =\n(s1 , . . . , sN , s\u03041 , . . . , s\u0304N ) and\nX\nk\nmi \u2212 m\u2032i =\n(yij + \u03b4i,j ) s\u0304j modk\n(2.8)\nnj\nj\nX zij k\nk\nk\nm\u2032i = (yii \u2212 1)si \u2212 s\u0304i +\ns\u0304j mod\n(2.9)\nni\nnij ni\nni\nj6=i\n\n(i)\n\nu(1)\nand wi = mi + 2si , wi\u2032 = m\u2032i + 2si + 2 nki s\u0304i .

It is interesting to study\nhow properties of this family of theories depend on the discrete torsion. This program has been\ndeveloped for general simple current modular invariants for what concerns boundary conditions,\nsee for instance [14]. In the next section we will focus on the geometrical interpretation of the\ndiscrete torsion.\n\n3\n\nThe geometrical description of discrete torsion\n\nLet us consider for the moment a general background manifold M with metric g and three-form\nH \u2208 H 3 (M, Z). To build a sigma-model with target space M, one specifies a gauge field (or\n2\n3\n\nHere we use interchangeably the notations \u00d7 and \u2295 for direct products of finite groups.\nThis is because the indices i are associated to the U (1)(i) subgroups of the chosen maximal torus.\n\n5\n\n\fconnection) B such that dB = H. This connection B is a collection of open sets Oi covering\nM, of 2-forms B i on Oi which locally trivialize H and such that B (i) \u2212 B (j) = dA(ij) are exact\non Oij = Oi \u2229 Oj \u2013 this defines a Deligne cohomology class of degree three4 . Two connections\nare equivalent if and only if they differ by a connection of a line bundle, the choice of which is\nparametrized by the first cohomology group H 1 (M, U(1)) [7]. Furthermore, since in our case\nthe three-form H-field is quantized, the second cohomology group H 2 (M, U(1)) acts freely and\ntransitively on the set of equivalence classes of connections. The role of H 2 (M, U(1)) for general\nbackgrounds M has been studied by Sharpe ( [8] and references therein), in connection to the\nusual discrete torsion introduced by Vafa [4]. In general, H 2 (M, U(1)) is non-zero for M a\nquotient of a simply connected manifold by some discrete group, which need not act freely.\nWe now specialize to the case where M is a quotient of a simple, simply-connected compact\nLie group G by some action, indexed by p, of an abelian discrete subgroup \u0393. We denote the\nquotient by M = G/\u0393p . Our results will apply to quotients of all compact Lie groups, since they\nall have a simply connected Lie group as covering space. As mentioned in the introduction,\nG/\u0393p inherits the translational invariant metric and H field from G, so that it is a target\nspace for some CFT as long as the quotienting respects the quantization condition on H. For\nconcreteness, and following Section 2, most of the calculations will be for G = SU(N), but the\ngeneralization to G a general simple, simply connected, compact Lie group is straightforward.\nBefore entering into more detail, it is useful to compare the group H 2 (G/\u0393p , U(1)) parametrizing the usual discrete torsion (\u00e0 la Vafa) with the algebraic discrete torsion group D(ZN\nk \u00d7 \u0393)\n(2.5). First we notice that for G simply connected, using the fact that \u03c02 (G) = 0, we have that\nH 2 (G/\u0393p , U(1)) = H 2(\u0393, U(1))\neven if the action of \u0393 is not free (in which case the lhs stands for the \u0393-equivariant cohomology\n[8]). This allows us to work exclusively in terms of group cohomology. Furthermore, from the\nshort exact sequence\n0 \u2192 Z \u2192 R \u2192 U(1) \u2192 0\nand using the fact that H \u2217 (\u0393, R) = 0, we get that\nH l (\u0393, U(1)) = H l+1 (\u0393, Z)\n\n(3.1)\n\nfor any positive integer l, and in particular we have\nD(G) = H 2 (Zk \u00d7 \u0393, U(1)) \u223c\n= H 3 (Zk \u00d7 \u0393, Z)\nTo determine H \u2217 (\u0393, Z) we use the K\u00fcnneth formula ( [11]) which implies that if X, Y are two\nfinite abelian groups then\n\u0001\nH \u2217 (X \u00d7 Y ) = (H \u2217 (X) \u2297Z H \u2217 (Y )) \u00d7 T or H \u2217 (X), H \u2217+1 (Y )\n(3.2)\nWe use here the standard mathematical notation that the sum of the degrees on the rhs is equal\nto the degree on the lhs. T or is a finite abelian group, which verifies T or(Z, *) = T or(*, Z) = 0\nand also\nT or (Zn , Zm ) = Zgcd(n,m) ,\n4\n\nT or (X, Y \u00d7 Z) = T or (X, Y ) \u00d7 T or (X, Z)\n\nThere are further conditions on the one-forms A(ij) , for more details see [7] and references therein.\n\n6\n\n\fThese properties will allow us to determine H \u2217 (\u0393, Z). Using (3.2) recursively for \u0393 = Zn1 \u00d7\n. . . \u00d7 ZnN we get for the usual discrete torsion\nH 2 (\u0393, U(1)) \u223c\n= H 3 (\u0393, Z) = \u2295i<j Zgcd(ni ,nj )\n\n(3.3)\nN(N\u22121)\n\nSimilarly, we compute the algebraic discrete torsion group to be (omitting the factor Zk 2 )\nM\nM\nD(G) =\nZN\n\u2295\nZgcd(ni ,nj )\n(3.4)\nni\ni\n\ni<j\n\nThis comparison suggests that the usual discrete torsion, that is the choice of connection B,\nis accounted for in the second factor of the CFT discrete torsion group D(G) (2.5)5 . Since\nthis action exhausts the transformations compatible with the given background, we should\nexpect that the CFT parameters encoded in the first factor \u0393N will correspond to a change of\nbackground. In order to study these parameters, we now consider the simplest example of the\ngeneralized lens spaces L(n,p) .\n\n3.1\n\nThe example of lens spaces\n\nA generalized lens space6 L(n,p) is a quotient of SU(2) by the equivalence relation [11]\ng\u223c\u03c9\n\np+1\n2\n\ng\u03c9\n\np\u22121\n2\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhere \u03c9 \u2208 Zn \u2282 SU(2) is an element of order n. Notice p is defined modulo n, since \u03c9 n/2 is a\ncentral element of order two. Usual lens spaces correspond to the choices p = \u00b11. In terms of\n\u03c7\n\u03c6\n\u03b8\nEuler coordinates g(\u03c7, \u03b8, \u03c6) = ei 2 \u03c33 ei 2 \u03c31 ei 2 \u03c33 this action amounts to\n\u03c7 \u2192 \u03c7 + 2\u03c0\n\np+1\np\u22121\n, \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6 \u2212 2\u03c0\nn\nn\n\n(3.6)\n\nIf n, p are not relatively prime, the action has a fixed circle \u03c7 + \u03c6 = const.\nThe sigma-model describing the usual lens spaces L(n,1) first appeared in [12] as the bosonization of a two-dimensional supersymmetric CFT which appears in the near horizon limit of\nan extremal four dimensional black hole. There the lens space was considered topologically\nas the Hopf fibration of U(1)/Zn over the sphere S 2 . The L(n,p) spaces with n, p relatively\nprime are topologically very similar. In particular, their fundamental group is \u03c01 (Ln ) \u2243 Zn\nwith the fiber being the non-trivial S 1 ; the maps in the different connected components of\n\u03c00 (Map(S 1 , Ln )) \u2243 Zn differ by the winding number around the non-trivial S 1 . Finally, their\nsecond cohomology group H 2 (L(n,p) , U(1)) is trivial, so that there is only one class of connections\nB for an integral H-field.\nTo study string theory on L(n,p) , we note that the action (3.6) breaks the su(2)k \u00d7 su(2)k\nsymmetry down to a u(1)2k \u00d7u(1)2k symmetry, which means that the appropriate chiral algebra\n5\n\nThat different choices of discrete torsion can be related to inequivalent choices of a connection on a bundle\ngerbe was also brought to my attention in discussions with Ch. Schweigert.\n6\nI thank G. Moore for bringing these spaces to my attention.\n\n7\n\n\fis su(2)k /u(1)2k \u00d7 u(1)2k , with k a multiple of n. Using the decomposition of (chiral) vertex\noperators\n2k\u22121\nX\nP F u(1)2k\nV su(2)k =\nVjm\nVm\nm=0\nm=j(2)\n\nand accounting for the action (3.6) on the left and right moving u(1) fields, we can write a\ngeneral vertex operator of the generalized lens space CFT as7\nV [j, m, w, s\u03041 ] = Vjm Vm\u2212(p\u22121) k s\u03041 * V\u0304jw V\u0304w\u2212(p+1) k s\u03041\nn\n\n(3.7)\n\nn\n\nwhere s\u03041 is a winding number. Here the fact that p is defined modulo n can be related to the\nthe field identification in the parafermion sector Vjm \u223c Vk\u2212j,m+k . Notice that the left and right\nmovers in (3.7) are related by simple currents of the su(2)k /u(1)2k \u00d7 u(1)2k theory which form\na group G = Zk \u00d7 Zn .\nTo get the spectrum, we first impose level matching on the vertex operators (3.7) (allowing\nfor arbitrary lowering operators, which do not affect the level matching condition) and then\nimpose modular invariance. In fact, due to the classification of simple current modular invariants [5] we know there is only one partition function with sectors of the form (3.7).

The matching of the partition\nfunctions written explicitely in terms of characters means that the CFTs are identical, so we\nhave found that the different choices of the discrete torsion correspond geometrically to the\ndifferent target spaces obtained by taking the quotients (3.5). In particular, for p = \u22121 we\nrecover the usual lens space SU(2)/Zn [12]\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nZ (Ln ) =\n\nk\nX\nj=0\n\n3.2\n\n\uf8ec\n(2)k \uf8ec\n\u03c7SU\nj\n\uf8ed\n\nX\n\nk\nm\u2212m\u2032 =0 mod 2 n\nm+m\u2032 =0 mod 2n\n\n\uf8f7\nk\uf8f7\n\u03c7\u0304PjmFk \u03c7\u0304Um(1)\n\u2032\n\uf8f8\n\n(3.9)\n\nThe general case\n\nWe now consider the general case of a compact, simply connected Lie group G and \u0393 \u223c\n=\nZn1 \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 ZnN an abelian subgroup of G, where some of the Zni may be trivial. From our\nexperience with the generalized lens spaces, we know that the discrete torsion parameters yij of\n(2.8) are related to the choice of equivalence relation, call it p(yij ), which defines the target space\nof the theory, denoted G/\u0393p . Upon inspection of the selection rules for the left movers (2.8)\n7\n\nTo simplify the notation we omit the superscripts. The vertex operators are recognizable by their labels.\n\n8\n\n\fand for the right movers (just below that equation), the general form of the vertex operators\nis determined to be\nV~\uf6be,m(~\n(3.10)\n~ s ) Vm\n~ \u2032 (~s) V\u0304~\uf6be,w(~\n~ s) V\u0304w\n~ \u2032 (~s)\nwith\nmi \u2212 m\u2032i =\n\nX\n\n(yij + \u03b4i,j )\n\nk\ns\u0304j modk\nnj\n\n(3.11)\n\nwi \u2212 wi\u2032 =\n\nX\n\n(yij \u2212 \u03b4i,j )\n\nk\ns\u0304j modk\nnj\n\n(3.12)\n\nj\n\nj\n\nWe find that the equivalence relation p(yij ) which determines the target space of this theory is\ng \u223c hLi g hR\ni ,\nwhere\n\nyii +1\n2\n\nhLi = \u03c9i\n\ni = 1, . . . , N\nyii \u22121\n2\n\ny /2\n\nhR\ni = \u03c9i\n\n\u03a0j6=i \u03c9j ij ,\n\n(3.13)\n\u2212yij /2\n\n\u03a0j6=i \u03c9j\n\n(3.14)\n\nand \u03c9i are elements of order ni along N directions of the maximal torus so that they commute\namong themselves. Notice that for non-zero values of yij this is an action of a subgroup of\n\u0393, but not of the whole \u0393. This relation generalizes (3.5) and accounts for the geometrical\ninterpretation of the parameters yij . Again, if yij and nj are not relatively prime there will be\nfixed point circles.\nNow given the set of allowed vertex operators, there will in general be a finite number of\npossible partition functions, corresponding to different choices of connections B for the threeform H-field. Recall that because the H-field is quantized, these are parametrized by the second\ncohomology H 2 (G/\u0393p , U(1)). Furthermore, since H 3 (G/\u0393p , Z) is without torsion, the action of\nH 2 (G/\u0393p , U(1)) on a connection B can be formally written in a way which resembles a globally\ndefined gauge transformation [7]\nB \u2192B+F\n(3.15)\nwhere F is a closed two-form on G/\u0393p . The transformation (3.15) does not change the connection equivalence class if and only if F \u2208 H 2 (G/\u0393p , Z) so we recover the action of H 2 (G/\u0393p , U(1))\non the set of equivalence classes of connections. These considerations are only formal because\nH 2 (G/\u0393p , U(1)) and H 2 (G/\u0393p , Z) in general have torsion, and only their non-torsion elements\ncan be related to the de Rham cohomology. In any case, if the target manifold has non-trivial\nsecond cohomology group, we may expect that the sigma-model path integral depend on the\nsecond homology of the embedding of the worldsheet \u03b9(\u03a3) in G/\u0393p . Indeed, as described in [8]\nthe group H 2 (G/\u0393p , U(1)) acts by multiplying the path integrand by a phase\neiS \u2192 ei\n\nR\n\nC\n\n \u0304 j iS\nFij \u2202X i \u2202X\n\ne\n\n(3.16)\n\nwhere C is the 2-cycle in G/\u0393p wrapped by \u03b9(\u03a3). Let us see how this may affect the spectrum.\nDenote by U(1)(i) the subgroup of the maximal torus containing the factor Zni of \u0393. Multiplying by the phase (3.16) will shift the left and right u(1) currents along both the i and\n\n9\n\n\f \u0304 a respectively (summation over a\nthe j directions, by j i \u2192 j i + Fai \u2202X a and \uf6be\u0304i \u2192 \uf6be\u0304i \u2212 Fai \u2202X\nintended). This means the corresponding left and right moving fields will shift as\nk\ns\u0304a\nni\nk\nwi\u2032 \u2192 wi\u2032 \u2212 Fai s\u0304a\nni\n\nm\u2032i \u2192 m\u2032i + Fai\n\n(3.17)\n\nwhere s\u0304a is the winding number. Recall that the phase (3.16) is a nth\nij root of unity, where\nnij = gcd(ni , nj ), so Fij = zij /nij with zij an integer. Thus the action of H 2 (\u0393, U(1)) \u223c\n=\nL\nZ\non\nthe\nspectrum\nindeed\ncorresponds\nto\nthe\ndiscrete\ntorsion\nshift\nz\nin\n(2.9)\nij\ni<j gcd(ni ,nj )\n(this is essentially as described by Vafa [4]). The simple current \"coordinates\" s\u0304i are then\ninterpreted as winding numbers.\nSo we have shown that where both sides are defined, discrete torsion on the CFT side and\non the geometric side are equivalent. It would be interesting to find out whether this holds true\neven when one side is not yet well known. For instance, it is not always clear what a different\nchoice of simple current group G corresponds to geometrically, but it should allow for the discrete\ntorsion which is present in the CFT side. On the other hand, we may consider backgrounds\nwhose topology is known but where the corresponding CFT is not well known, such as more\ngeneral quotients by abelian groups, obtained by generalizing (3.13) to an equivalence relation\nwith two parameters, a pleft and a pright . Other more general situations would be for instance\nquotients by non-abelian groups or quotients of more complicated groups such as products of\ngroups or non-compact groups. We expect to find in the corresponding CFT a free parameter\nwhich corresponds to the geometric freedom of choice of connection.\n\n3.3\n\nRemarks\n\nThe T-dual version of these models can be easily studied in the CFT approach. For the choice\nof discrete torsion which preserves the chiral symmetry, i.e. for pi = \u00b11, T-dualizing along a\nU(1) direction where a Zni acts results in a theory where Zni is replaced by Zk/ni . This was\nused extensively in [13], [6] to study B-type branes in lens spaces.\nHowever, for any different choice of discrete torsion, T-duality will yield a quotient of G\nwhich, though preserving the left and right u(1) symmetries, is not of the form (3.13). Indeed, in\ngeneral, \u0393 changes not only by replacing Zni by Zk/ni but also by changing the generator of the\ndiagonal Zk . Finding the geometrical interpretation of such simple current modular invariants\nwould give more information on the exact T-duality transformations of a curved background.\nWe should note that the group H 1 (M, U(1)) which parametrizes the gauge choices for the\nconnection B (cf. section 3) does affect the open string theory, since its action amounts to\nintroducing Wilson lines in the background. To see this, let us first consider the symmetric\nboundary states in simple current CFTs [14]. All choices of discrete torsion appear on the same\nfooting, so we can describe easily the boundary blocks, the boundary states and their annuli\namplitudes in all the models considered above. In fact, only fractional boundary blocks, which\nappear whenever some ni is even, depend on the discrete torsion. Let D be the worldvolume of\nsome fractional brane. Then H 1 (M, U(1)) acts (projectively, via H 1 (D, U(1))) by transforming\nthe fractional branes with worldvolume D into each other.\n10\n\n\fAcknowledgements.
