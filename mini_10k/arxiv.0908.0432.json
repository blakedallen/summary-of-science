They could be solitons in field theories\nwith spontaneously broken symmetries [4], singular solutions with cylindrical symmetry in supergravity theories\n[5] or fundamental objects in string theory [6]. They may\nform in thermal phase transitions [4], at the end of hybrid inflation [7, 8, 9, 10], or by tachyon condensation at\nthe end of brane inflation when brane and anti-brane annihilate [11, 12]. If cosmic strings are added to the standard power-law \u039bCDM model, the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB) data is fitted even better [13, 14]\nif the fraction of the temperature power spectrum (at\nl = 10) due to strings f10 is about 0.1. There is therefore strong motivation to develop further tests for strings\nin future CMB data, which provide the cleanest and\nbest understood cosmological string signals [15, 16, 17].\nCalculations of the polarisation B-mode [18, 19] show\nthat a promising line of attack for the near future is\nto look for a signal peaked between l = 600 to 1000.\nSimulations of Planck data show that it will be sensitive down to f10 \u2243 0.01, and that there is no danger\nof confusing strings with inflationary tensor perturba-\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: m.b.hindmarsh@sussex.ac.uk\naddress: christophe.ringeval@uclouvain.be\n\u2021 Electronic address: teruaki.suyama@uclouvain.be\n\u2020 Electronic\n\ntions [18]. Perhaps the most characteristic signal in the\nCMB comes from the Gott-Kaiser-Stebbins (GKS) effect [20, 21], which is due to the gravitational lensing of\nphotons passing near a moving string. This produces a\ndiscontinuity in the apparent temperature approximately\nproportional to the transverse velocity of the string v and\nthe string tension U :\n\u03b4T \u223c 8\u03c0(GU )vTCMB ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere G is Newton's constant. Given that strings move\nwith a mean square (RMS) velocity of between 0.25 and\n0.36 [22, 23] we would expect to see discontinuities \u03b4T\nof up to about 1 \u03bcK. Recent calculations of the integrated Sachs-Wolf CMB signal at small angular scales\nhave shown that the angular power spectrum it produces\ndecreases slowly, approximately l\u22120.9 at high multipole\nmoment l [24]. If f10 \u2243 0.1 strings should dominate\nthe adiabatic temperature power spectrum for l & 3000,\nand remain above the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect.\nThis fraction corresponds to GU \u2243 0.7 \u00d7 10\u22126 for strings\nin the Abelian Higgs model [14]. The slow power-law\ndecrease in the power spectrum is quite close to a prediction of the small scale power spectrum using the string\ncorrelation functions in a Gaussian approximation [25],\nwhich gave a temperature anisotropy power going as l\u22121 .\nThe non-Gaussian nature of the maps exhibited in [24],\nas for example exhibited by the skewness of the distribution of the 1-point function, immediately motivates an\nattempt to generalise the calculation to higher-order correlators, and in particular the 3-point function or bispec-\n\n\f2\ntrum, which will become increasingly well characterised\nby future CMB data [17, 26, 27, 28]. This paper reports\non the results of this calculation. It is found that the\nbispectrum for an isosceles arrangement of wavevectors\nk in Fourier space is generically negative and decreases\nas |k|\u22126 . It is proportional to (GU )3 and hence to the\npower spectrum raised to the 3/2 power. The scale of the\nnon-linearity parameter fNL , defined by dividing the bispectrum by the square of the power spectrum, is therefore\npotentially large, going as (GU )\u22121 .\nII.\nA.\n\nwhere we have defined\n\u01eb = 8\u03c0GU,\n\nand A = 1, 2 with implicit summation on repeated indices. It is now clear that the power spectrum, bispectrum, and higher order correlators can be evaluated in\nterms of correlation functions of the string network, as\nprojected onto our backward light cone. In the next section we will introduce the relevant correlation functions\nand discuss their important features.\n\nANALYTICAL BISPECTRUM\n\nB.\n\nGott-Kaiser-Stebbins effect\n\nWe work in the flat sky approximation, and define\ntransverse coordinates x measured in radians. The wave\nnumber k is related to the multipole moment l by [29, 30]\nk 2 \u2243 l(l + 1).\n\n(2)\n\nThe anisotropy power l(l + 1)Cl is then approximately\nequal to k 2 |\u03b4Tk |2 , where \u03b4Tk is the Fourier transform of\nthe temperature fluctuation,\nZ\n\u03b4Tk = dx\u03b4T eik*x .\n(3)\nWe will also define \u0398(x) = \u03b4T (x)/TCMB . String spacetime coordinates will be denoted X \u03bc (\u03c4, \u03c3), where \u03c4 and\n\u03c3 are timelike and spacelike worldsheet coordinates respectively. In the temporal gauge the X 0 = \u03c4 (where the\nworldsheet time is identified with the background time\ncoordinate) the (corrected) GKS formula is [25]\n\"\n#\nZ\n(X\u0301 * p\u0302)\n2\n\u2207 \u0398 = \u22128\u03c0GU d\u03c3 \u1e8a \u2212\nX\u0301 * \u2207\u03b4 (2) (x \u2212 X),\n(\u1e8a * p\u0302)\n(4)\nwhere p\u0302\u03bc = p\u03bc /E, and worldsheet variables are evaluated\nat the retarded time tr = t+z \u2212X 3(\u03c3, tr ), when the CMB\nphotons (taken to be moving in the \u2212z direction) pass\nthe string. The expression is greatly simplified in the\nlight cone gauge,\nX + (\u03c3, \u03c4 ) = \u03c4,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere X \u00b1 = X 0 \u00b1 X 3 . The time parameter \u03c4 then labels\nthe intersections with a set of null hyperplanes with the\nworldsheet: the photon geodesics Z \u03bc = x\u03bc + \u03bbp\u03bc form\njust such a set. Then we find\nZ\n\u22072 \u0398 = \u22128\u03c0GU d\u03c3 \u1e8a * \u2207\u03b4 (2) (x \u2212 X),\n(6)\nwhere worldsheet quantities are now evaluated at \u03c4 =\nx+ = t + z. In Fourier space the equation becomes\nZ\n2\n\u2212 k \u0398k = i\u01ebkA d\u03c3 \u1e8a A (\u03c3)eik*X(\u03c3) ,\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nString correlation functions\n\nWe denote the transverse coordinates of the string,\nX A (\u03c3). The basic two point functions are\nh\u1e8a A (\u03c3)\u1e8a B (\u03c3 \u2032 )i,\n\nh\u1e8a A (\u03c3)X\u0301 B (\u03c3 \u2032 )i,\n\nhX\u0301 A (\u03c3)X\u0301 B (\u03c3 \u2032 )i,\n(9)\nwhere the angle brackets denote an average over an ensemble of strings. The starting assumption is that the\nstring ensemble is well-approximated by a Gaussian process: that is, all correlators can be calculated in terms of\nthe two point functions. We now make some assumptions\nabout the ensemble: (i) rotation, reflection and translation invariance of the transverse coordinates; and (ii)\nworldsheet reflection and translation invariance. Then\nthere are three independent correlation functions:\n1 AB\n\u03b4 V (\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3 \u2032 ),\n2\n1\nhX\u0301 A (\u03c3)X\u0301 B (\u03c3 \u2032 )i = \u03b4 AB T (\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3 \u2032 ),\n2\n1\nhX\u0301 A (\u03c3)\u1e8a B (\u03c3 \u2032 )i = \u03b4 AB M1 (\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3 \u2032 ).\n2\nh\u1e8a A (\u03c3)\u1e8a B (\u03c3 \u2032 )i =\n\n(10)\n(11)\n(12)\n\nA fourth,\nM2 (\u03c3) = h\u1e8a A (\u03c3)X\u0301 B (0)i\u01ebAB ,\n\n(13)\n\nvanishes because of the symmetry X 1 \u2194 X 2 (this point\nwas overlooked in Ref.

[24] have a\nslightly different small-scale angular power spectrum:\nk 2 P (k) \u223c k \u2212p with p \u2243 \u22120.89.

This correlation\nfunction controls how far on average one moves in the\ntransverse coordinates as one moves along the string:\np = 1 would correspond to straight lines, while p = 2 to\na Brownian random walk.

Such a configuration diverges in the two flat\ntriangle limits for which either \u03b8 \u2192 0 or \u03b8 \u2192 \u03c0. Both\nof these configurations are therefore better suited than\nthe equilateral one to characterize the strings and are\ndiscussed in the next sections.

Nevertheless, flat triangles should provide the best framework for\nthe search of a string bispectrum signature. In fact, the\nchange of sign in between the squeezed and collapsed triangles is also of interest to improve the signal to noise\nratio. Substracting these two configurations with the appropriate angles should enhance the string signal over the\nnoise.\nBk\u03c6\u03c6 \u2261 lim Biso (k, \u03b8) \u223c +\u01eb3 3\u03c0c0\n\n4.\n\nEquilateral triangles\n\nFor completeness, we give the bispectrum in the particular case \u03b8 = \u03c0/3, where the ka are arranged in an\nequilateral triangle:\n|k1 | = |k2 | = |k3 | = k.\n\n(63)\n\n\f7\nOne has \u03baab = k 2 /2, and the\n\u221a factor in the squared brackets in Eq.

These maps have been obtained along the\nlines of Ref. [24] from Nambu\u2013Goto numerical simulations in FLRW space-time. As detailed in this reference,\nthey are obtained from the GKS effect using Eq. (4),\nand are therefore valid on small angular scales only. In\nthe next sections, we briefly recall the numerical method\nused to generate the maps and then discuss our bispectrum estimator.\n\nprocedure introduces one additional parameter which is\nthe redshift at which we start the simulations zi . It has\nbeen set to the last scattering surface, namely zi = 1089,\nand in a flat \"Lambda-Cold-Dark-Matter\" (\u039bCDM) universe, using fiducial values for the density parameters\ncompatible with the three-year Wilkinson Microwave\nAnisotropy Probe (WMAP) data [37], this corresponds\nto a numerical comoving box of Lsim \u2243 1.7 Gpc. Such\na size subtends a angle of \u03b8fov \u2243 7.2\u25e6 in the sky. The\nNambu-Goto simulations and the associated CMB maps\ntherefore depend on only two parameters: the string energy per unit length U , and the initial correlation length\nlc . The dependence on lc should drop out at late times,\nas the network is believed to approach a self-similar or\nscaling configuration. However, in a real Nambu-Goto\nsimulation, there is still some non-scaling structure evident on the smallest length scales [24]. As an illustration\nexample, a typical CMB temperature anisotropy map is\nrepresented in Fig. 3, together with the seeding strings\nprojected on our past light cone. We have used our numerical simulations to create 300 statistically independent temperature maps from which one can construct a\nbispectrum estimator.\nB.\n\nA.\n\nNambu\u2013Goto numerical simulations\n\n1.\n\nOur FLRW numerical simulations are based on an improved version of the Bennett and Bouchet Nambu-Goto\ncosmic string code [24, 34, 35]. The runs are performed in\na comoving box with periodic boundary conditions and\nwhose volume has been scaled to unity. The horizon size\ndh0 is a free parameter controlling the initial string energy within a horizon volume. For the simulations we\nperformed, dh0 \u2243 0.185. The string network is assumed\nto come from Vachaspati-Vilenkin initial conditions for\nwhich the long strings path is a random walk of correlation length lc , plus a random transverse velocity component of root mean squared amplitude 0.1 [36]. These\nparameters are set as in Ref. [24] to minimize the relaxation time of the Vachaspati-Vilenkin string network\ntoward its stable cosmological configuration. The temperature maps are then produced according the GKS effect generated by the strings intercepting our past light\ncone, using the Eq.

II F. Our results are presented in the next\nsection. The variance of the bispectrum over the different maps is used to provide an estimate of the statistical\nerrors associated with our approach. Notice however, as\ndiscussed at length in Ref. [24], the Nambu-Goto string\nsimulation do also lead to some systematic errors due to\nthe non-scaling structure.

As a result, w has been kept to\na low value (w = 3\u03c0) and the modes have been binned to\nreduce the statistical errors. As can be seen in Fig. 9, our\nnumerical estimation does not allow to accurately traces\nthe bispectrum down to the small values of \u03c6.

This can be understood by using the nearly Gaussian approximation in which the non-Gaussian trispectrum is neglected.

In Fig. 12, we have plotted the standard deviation obtained from Eq. (88), and relying only on the\nmean string power spectrum, together with the measured\nstandard deviation of our bispectrum estimator. There\nis good agreement for both the power law behaviour and\nthe overall amplitude. From this section, we conclude\nthat although the cosmic string equilateral bispectrum\n\nFrom both the analytical and numerical results, the\ncosmic string bispectra associated with the flat triangle\nconfigurations are the best suited to look for string signatures. However, it is not easy to compare with existing\nbispectrum estimates as much of the literature focuses on\nparticular local models of primordial non-Gaussianity in\nwhich the Newtonian potential is parametrised [42]\n\u0002 2\n\u0003\nloc\n\u03a6L (x) \u2212 \u03a62L (x) .\n(89)\n\u03a6(x) = \u03a6(x)L + fNL\n\nThe local type of primordial non-Gaussianity produces\na bispectrum whose maximal amplitude occurs for\nsqueezed triangle configurations, as it is the case for the\ncosmic strings. However, as a result of the CMB transloc\nfer functions, a given value of fNL\ncorresponds to oscillating damped patterns of the CMB temperature bispectrum, which are therefore completely different from\nthe power law we have derived for the strings at small\nloc\nscales. The current bounds on fNL\nbeing precisely obtained from template matching procedures, they cannot\nbe applied to the string bispectrum [17, 28]. Notice that\nthe analysis concerned with the other type of primordial\nnon-Gaussianities, such as the equilateral ones characeq\nterised by fNL\n, are also affected by the CMB transfer\nfunction [17] and cannot straightforwardly be compared\nto our findings.\nHowever, a simple calculation we can do at this stage\nis, at a given angular scale, to compare the overall amplitude the CMB bispectrum induced by a primordial\nloc\nfNL\nwith the one induced by the presence of cosmic\nstrings. For simplicity, let us choose the equilateral configuration (which is not of maximal amplitude for both\nthe strings and local primordial non-Gaussianity). With\nCOBE-normalised CMB temperature fluctuations, and\nneglecting Silk damping, Ref. [42] gives the amplitude of\nthe oscillating CMB bispectrum induced by primordial\nnon-Gaussianity:\nloc\nmax |Blll | \u2243 (2 \u00d7 10\u221217 )l\u22124 |fNL\n|.\n\n(90)\n\nWe can now estimate the size of the equilateral bispectrum from strings if they contribute about 10% of the\ntemperature power spectrum at l = 10. In this case\n\u01eb \u2243 2 \u00d7 10\u22125 , and assuming Abelian Higgs strings where\nGU \u2243 0.7 \u00d7 10\u22126 [14, 43], one has\nBkkk \u2243 \u2212(4\u00d710\u221214 )c0\n\n\u00133\n\u0012\nv\u0304 2 L\u03be\u02c6 1\nGU\n. (91)\nt\u03044 A \u03be\u02c62 k 6 0.7 \u00d7 10\u22126\n\n\f13\nMatching the two suggests that string fluctuations may\ngenerate a temperature bispectrum at l \u2243 500 as large\nloc\nas the one that would be produced by a local |fNL\n| of\n3\naround 10 (k \u03be\u0302 \u2243 1 is near the peak of the scalar modes\nat l \u223c 500). This number should be considered as an\norder of magnitude estimate since the string bispectrum\ncalculation is only accurate for higher l, while Eq. (90)\nis applicable for l \u2264 1000 [42]. Let us also mention that\nloc\nthis value for fNL\nis only valid at l \u2243 500 and does not\nrepresent the value that would be obtained by a local primordial bispectrum template matching against the string\nbispectrum. In order to obtain such a value, one should\nperform a Fisher matrix analysis over all the multipoles\nalong the lines of Refs. [44, 45]. Such an analysis is outside the scope of this paper and we leave it for a forthcoming work.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have analytically and numerically derived the CMB\ntemperature bispectrum induced by cosmic strings from\nthe Gott\u2013Kaiser\u2013Stebbins effect. This effect is the main\nsource of string induced CMB anisotropies at small angle and our result is applicable at those angular scales\nonly. The bispectrum is negative for equilateral and all\nisosceles squeezed configurations, having a power law decay close to l\u22126 . The squeezed isosceles bispectrum is\nsignificantly amplified for small squeezing angle by a factor \u03b8\u22123 . Although the vanishing limit is forbidden by any\nfinite detector resolution, one should expect the ongoing\nand future high resolution CMB experiment to be more\nsensitive to these signatures [46, 47, 48]. The collapsed\nisosceles configuration still exhibits the same power law,\nan angle dependency in \u03c6\u22123 (with \u03c6 = \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8) but leads\nto a positive bispectrum. This feature could allow an\nenhancement of the string signal by subtracting the bispectrum of these two configurations. The numerically\nmeasured amplitudes have been given in the text and,\nat the particular scale l = 500, they roughly correspond\nloc\nto a |fNL\n| \u2243 103 for the local type of primordial nonGaussianity in the equilateral configurations. This number is of illustrative purpose only and should be treated\nwith caution. Firstly, the temperature bispectrum induced by the strings has a different multipole dependency\nthan the one coming from primordial non-Gaussianities.\nloc\nquoted above is definitely\nAs a result, the value for fNL\nnot the one that would be obtain by applying a primordial bispectrum template matching over the actual\nstring bispectrum. In particular, the current bounds derived so far on the primordial fNL values do not apply\nfor the strings. Moreover, even at the string prediction\nlevel, there are competing and correlated effects at this\nangular scale, notably the acoustic oscillations that we\nhave not considered here. Nevertheless, this value for\nloc\nshows that this is an interesting angular scale to\nfNL\nsearch for string non-Gaussianity and that devoted string\ntemplate matching should be used in the search of CMB\n\nnon-Gaussian signals.\nFinally, as the power law dependence of the bispectrum\nvariance may suggest, we should expect an even stronger\nnon-Gaussian signal from the cosmic string trispectrum\nand we leave its analysis for a forthcoming work.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work is partially supported by the Belgian Federal Office for Scientific, Technical, and Cultural Affairs through the Inter-University Attraction Pole Grant\nNo.\nP6/11.\nThe cosmic string simulations have\nbeen performed thanks to computing support provided\nby the Planck-HFI processing center at the Institut\nd'Astrophysique de Paris.\nAPPENDIX A: STRING COORDINATE\nINTEGRATIONS\n\nIn this Appendix we perform the integrals over the\nstring coordinates \u03c3a in the expression (55) for the bispectrum.
