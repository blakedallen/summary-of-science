An isolated (\u03bcp)2S is metastable with a lifetime mainly\ndetermined by muon decay (about 2.2 \u03bcs). In liquid or gaseous hydrogen the\nlifetime of the 2S state is shortened considerably because of Stark mixing\nfollowed by 2P \u2192 1S radiative transitions. If a sizeable fraction of muonic\nhydrogen atoms ends up in the 2S state with a sufficiently long lifetime, then\nprecision laser experiments with this metastable 2S state become feasible. If\nthe (\u03bcp)2S has kinetic energy below the 2P threshold (laboratory kinetic\nenergy T0 = 0.3 eV), then Stark transitions 2S \u2192 2P are energetically\nforbidden1 . The metastable fraction of (\u03bcp)2S in hydrogen depends on the\nkinetic energy at the time of formation.\nThe first estimate of the (\u03bcp)2S lifetime was done by Kodosky and Leon\n[5]. They calculated the inelastic 2S \u2192 2P cross section in a semiclassical\nframework and concluded that the 2S state for T > T0 will be rapidly depopulated except for very small target densities. However, this model did not\nconsider deceleration due to elastic 2S \u2192 2S scattering. A more elaborate\napproach was developed by Carboni and Fiorentini [6]. They calculated both\nelastic 2S \u2192 2S and inelastic 2S \u2192 2P cross sections quantum mechanically\nand estimated the probability for a (\u03bcp)2S atom to slow down below threshold from a given initial energy. The results of their calculations show that\na sizeable fraction of (\u03bcp)2S formed at kinetic energies less than 1.3 eV can\nslow down below the 2P threshold.\nThe metastable fraction of (\u03bcp)2S per stopped muon can in principle\nbe calculated in a cascade model which takes the different processes (Stark\nmixing, radiative decays, etc.) into account [7, 8]. However, if one knows the\nfraction of stopped muons which reaches the 2S state (regardless of energy)\nand the kinetic energy distribution on arrival in this state, then it is sufficient\nto treat the final part of the cascade (n = 1, 2). This information can be\nobtained from experiments. The fraction of stopped muons which arrives\nin the 2S state can be determined from the radiative yields [9\u201311]: it was\nfound in Ref. [9] that between 2% and 7% of the \u03bcp reach the 2S state\nin the pressure range 0.33 \u2212 800 hPa. The kinetic energy distribution for\n\u03bcp in the 1S state, which for low pressures is expected to be very similar\nto that of the 2S state just after arrival, can be obtained from diffusion\nexperiments [12, 13]. The median energy is found to be about 1.5 eV for a\n1\n\nSome quenching will, however, occur because 2S \u2212 2P mixing during collisions allows\nradiative transitions to the 1S state (See Refs. [2\u20134]).\n\n2\n\n\f\u03bc\nr\nR\n\np\n\np\n\nFigure 1: Coordinates used in the calculations: R is the vector from the\ntarget proton to the center of mass of the \u03bcp, r is the relative vector of the\n\u03bcp system.\ntarget pressure of 0.25 hPa [13].\nThe purpose of this paper is to calculate the fraction of \u03bcp in the 2S state\nwhich reaches kinetic energies below the 2P threshold as a function of the\ninitial kinetic energy T . We will also present a fully quantum mechanical\ncalculation of \u03bcp+H differential cross sections which are used in our Monte\nCarlo simulation of the kinetics.\nThe paper is organized as follows. The theoretical framework of the\nquantum mechanical calculation of the cross sections is outlined in Section 2.\nThe calculated cross sections are discussed in Section 3. Section 4 presents\nthe calculations of the metastable 2S fraction. The summary of the results\nis given in Section 5.\nUnless otherwise stated, atomic units (h\u0304 = a0 = me = 1) are used\nthroughout this paper. The unit of cross section is a20 = 2.8 * 10\u221217 cm2 .\n\n2\n\nQuantum Mechanical Approach to the Calculation of the Cross Sections (\u03bcp)nl + H \u2192\n(\u03bcp)nl\u2032 + H\n\nFor the benefit of the reader, we briefly describe the quantum mechanical\ncalculation of \u03bcp+H scattering in the coupled-channel approximation. The\nthree-body wave function \u03c8(r, R) where the coordinates r and R are defined\nin Fig. 1 satisfies the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nH\u03c8(r, R) = E\u03c8(r, R)\n\n3\n\n(1)\n\n\fwhere the Hamiltonian is given by\nH =\u2212\n\n\u22072\n+ H\u03bcp + V (r, R) .\n2\u03bc\n\n(2)\n\nHere \u03bc = mp m\u03bcp /(mp + m\u03bcp ) is the reduced mass of the p \u2212 \u03bcp system,\nwith mp being the proton mass and m\u03bcp the total \u03bcp mass. The two-body\nHamiltonian of the \u03bcp atom, H\u03bcp , includes the Coulomb interaction and a\nterm that describes the shift of the nS state (mainly because of the vacuum\npolarization) with respect to the states with l > 0. For the case n = 2\nconsidered below, the 2S state is lower than the 2P by \u2206E = 0.21 eV.\nThe much smaller fine and hyperfine structure splitting is neglected. The\npotential V (r, R) describes the interaction of the \u03bcp system with the target\nproton2 :\n1\n1\nV (r, R) =\n\u2212\n(3)\n|R \u2212 \u01ebr| |R + (1 \u2212 \u01eb)r|\n\nwhere \u01eb = m\u03bc /m\u03bcp = 0.101.\nEquation (1) is solved in the coupled-channel approximation by using a\nfinite number of basis functions to describe the state of the \u03bcp. For the\nproblem of nlm \u2192 nl\u2032 m\u2032 scattering considered in this paper, the set of n2\neigenstates with principal quantum number n has been selected but the basis\ncan be extended in a straightforward manner. With n fixed, let \u03c7lm (r) denote\nthe normalized eigenfunctions of the atomic Hamiltonian H\u03bcp with the energy\nEnl , the square of the \u03bcp internal angular momentum l2 (eigenvalue l(l + 1))\nand its projection along the z-axis lz (eigenvalue m).

Here L is the p \u2212 \u03bcp relative angular\nmomentum, J = L + l is the total orbital angular momentum of the system.\n2\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, we ignore the fact that the protons are identical particles.\n\n4\n\n\fFor a given value of J the system of radial Schr\u00f6dinger equations has the\nform\n\u0011\nX\n1 d2\nL(L + 1)\nhL\u2032 l\u2032 JM|V |LlJMi\u03beJL\u2032 l\u2032 (R) = 0\n+\n+E\n\u2212E\n\u03be\n(R)+\nnl\nJLl\n2\u03bc dR2\n2\u03bcR2\n\u2032\n\u2032\nLl\n(6)\nwhere the potential matrix elements are calculated in the basis (5):\n\u0010\n\n\u2212\n\nJM\nh\u03a9, r|LlJMi = YLl\n(\u03a9, r) .\n\n(7)\n\nThe matrix elements of the potential (3) have been calculated analytically;\nthe corresponding formulas are rather lengthy and will be given elsewhere.\nFrom the asymptotic form of the solution of the n2 coupled3 equations (6),\nthe scattering matrix S is extracted and cross sections can be calculated\nusing standard formulas.

(4) is not sufficient to describe the\ntotal three-body wave function \u03c8(r, R). Furthermore, exchange symmetry\nbetween the two protons must be taken into account. We can estimate the\nsensitivity of our results to the short range part of the interaction by using\nthe dipole approximation for the potential (3). The interaction in the dipole\napproximation is given by the first nonzero term in the expansion of Eq. (3)\nin inverse powers of R:\nVDA (r, R) =\n\nr*R\nz\n= 2\n3\nR\nR\n\n.\n\n(14)\n\nA certain problem arises in the dipole approximation for a few low partial\nwaves (J \u2264 5): the Schr\u00f6dinger equation becomes ill defined because of the\nattractive 1/R2 singularity4 . Following Ref. [6] we cure this difficulty by\nplacing an infinitely repulsive sphere of radius rmin around the target proton.\nThe sensitivity of the results to this cutoff parameter rmin will be used below\nas an estimate of the importance of detailed description of the interaction at\nshort distances.\nIn this paper we are interested in the 2l \u2192 2l\u2032 transitions, and only four\nstates n = 2 are used to describe the \u03bcp part of the total wave function.\nThe four coupled second order equations (6) are solved numerically for J =\n0, 1, ..., Jmax where the highest partial wave Jmax is chosen large enough to\nensure the convergence of the partial wave expansion at given collision energy.\n4\n\nThis is a problem only in the dipole approximation. The exact matrix elements are\nall finite for R = 0.\n\n6\n\n\fUntil now we have considered the \u03bcp collisions with the atomic target.\nTreating the collisions with hydrogen molecules is a formidable task (even\nfor \u03bcp in the ground state [14]) which we do not attempt here. The inelastic threshold T0 for 2S \u2192 2P transitions is 0.44 eV for atomic target and\n0.33 eV for a molecular target. To get the correct threshold value for the\ninelastic cross sections one can substitute the atomic hydrogen mass with\nthe molecular one. By varying rmin and the target mass one can obtain an\nestimate of the theoretical uncertainty of our approach.\nThe present model for calculating cross sections for (\u03bcp)n=2 \u2212H scattering\nis a straightforward extension of the one by Carboni and Fiorentini [6]. There\nare three major differences: we solve the four coupled differential equations\nexactly while Ref. [6] treated non adiabatic terms as a perturbation. The\nsecond difference is that we include the full angular coupling while Ref. [6]\nomitted some minor terms. Finally, we use exact matrix elements for the\n\u03bcp \u2212 p interaction while Ref. [6] considers only the dipole approximation.\nThese approximations were justified by Ref. [6] as follows: for small kinetic\nenergies the velocity of the muonic hydrogen atom is so low that the motion\ncan be regarded as nearly adiabatic. The angular coupling terms that were\nomitted in Ref. [6] are of the order 1 which is much smaller than the remaining\nangular coupling terms of the order of J(J +1) (the angular momenta as high\nas J \u223c 15 contribute to the 2S \u2192 2P cross section at T = 1 eV). The electric\nfield from a hydrogen atom is strong enough to induce Stark transitions in\nthe \u03bcp for the distances R \u223c a0 . Therefore, the regions where the dipole\napproximation is valid (R \u226b a\u03bc ) are supposed to be most important. The\ndiffusion experiments [12, 13] have shown that a sizeable fraction of (\u03bcp)n=2\natoms has kinetic energies of several eV. In this high energy region the non\nadiabatic couplings become strong and the model of Ref. [6] can not be\nexpected to give accurate results.\nThe problem of \u03bcp+H scattering has been treated fully quantum mechanically in Refs. [16\u201319]. However, these calculations did not include the\n2S \u2212 2P energy splitting and the question of the metastability of (\u03bcp)2S was\nnot addressed. Stark mixing has been studied in the semiclassical straightline-trajectory approximation in Refs. [5, 15, 20]. We have calculated the\n2S \u2192 2P Stark mixing cross sections in the semiclassical approach in order\nto compare with the quantum mechanical results. A more detailed comparison between semiclassical and quantum mechanical calculations of \u03bcp + H\nscattering will be given elsewhere.\n\n7\n\n\f10\nTransport 2s\u2212>2s\n\n2\n\n\u03c3 (a0 )\n\n8\n6\n\nStark mixing 2s\u2212>2p\n\n4\n2\n0\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\nT (eV)\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\nFigure 2: Transport cross section 2S \u2192 2S (solid lines) and Stark mixing\ncross section 2S \u2192 2P (long-dashed lines) vs. laboratory kinetic energy T .\nThe thick lines are the results of the present calculations, the thin lines are\nobtained from Fig. 3 of Ref. [6] and the dotted line shows the result of the\nsemiclassical calculation in the straight-line-trajectory approximation.

Unless otherwise\nexplicitly stated, the results shown are obtained with the exact potential (3).\nElectron screening is always taken into account. Both atomic and molecular\nmass of the target (Mtarget = MH , MH2 ) have been used.\nFigure 2 shows the 2S \u2192 2S transport cross section and the 2S \u2192 2P\nStark mixing cross section in comparison with the results from Ref. [6] (the\nmolecular mass is used in both cases). There is a good agreement for the\nStark mixing 2S \u2192 2P cross section below 1.7 eV. For the 2S \u2192 2S transport\ncross section, the agreement is fair, with the discrepancy being typically less\nthan 30%.\nIn order to estimate the theoretical uncertainty of our approach, we calculated the cross sections in the dipole approximation with short distance\ncutoff 0.01 \u2264 rmin \u2264 0.05 for Mtarget = MH and Mtarget = MH2 . For fixed\nvalue of Mtarget , the cross sections for the three reactions 2S \u2192 2P , 2P \u2192 2S\nand 2P \u2192 2P are weakly dependent on rmin . This shows that these reactions\n8\n\n\f(a)\n\u03bcp+H\n\n0.6\n\n2s\u2212>2p\n\n\u03bcp+H\n\n1.0\n\n0.4\n\n2s\u2212>2s\n\n2\n\n\u03c3J (a0 )\n\n2\n\n\u03c3J (a0 )\n\n(b)\n\n0.5\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n0.0\n\n25\n\nJ\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\nJ\n\n15\n\n20\n\nFigure 3: Partial wave cross sections for the reactions 2S \u2192 2P (a) and\n2S \u2192 2S (b) at laboratory kinetic energy 3 eV and Mtarget = MH . The\nhistograms show the results for exact matrix elements; the dipole approximation with rmin = 0.01 and rmin = 0.05 is shown by o and \u00d7, respectively.\nThe semiclassical result for the 2S \u2192 2P transition is shown with a solid\nline.\nare dominated by the long range part of the interaction V (r, R). The only\nprocess rather sensitive to the value of rmin is the elastic scattering 2S \u2192 2S.\nThis can be understood by considering the adiabatic energy curves for low\nangular momentum. The energy curve which corresponds asymptotically to\nthe 2S state is attractive while those corresponding to the three 2P states\nare repulsive. Therefore, in the adiabatic approximation the 2S \u2192 2S cross\nsections are expected to depend on the short range part of the potential\nwhile this is not the case for 2P \u2192 2P scattering. At energies above 2 eV\nthe semiclassical approximation is in a good agreement with our quantum\nmechanical results. However, this semiclassical approximation does not treat\nthe threshold behaviour correctly.\nA more detailed comparison of the approximations used can be done by\nplotting the J dependence of the partial wave cross sections \u03c3J at fixed energy\nas shown in Fig. 3. The quantum mechanical results obtained for the exact\npotential and the dipole approximation with the short range cutoff agree well\nfor angular momentum J > 5 while the lowest partial waves are sensitive to\nthe short range behaviour of the approximating potentials. The reason is\nthat for J > 5 the centrifugal barrier is strong enough to prevent the \u03bcp\nfrom approaching close to the target proton. For J \u2264 5 the \u03bcp can get very\nclose to the proton and the use of a small number of atomic orbitals is not\nsufficient - a better description in this region is needed in a true three\u2013\n9\n\n\f(a)\nT=1 eV\nT=3 eV\nT=6 eV\n\n\u03bcp+H\n\n1\n\n10\n\nT=1 eV\nT=3 eV\nT=6 eV\n\n\u03bcp+H2\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n2\n\n2\n\n10\n\nd\u03c3/d\u03a9 (a0 /str)\n\n10\n\nd\u03c3/d\u03a9 (a0 /str)\n\n(b)\n2\n\n2\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\n30\n\n60\n\n90\n120\n\u03b8 (deg)\n\n150\n\n180\n\n0\n\n30\n\n60\n\n90\n120\n\u03b8 (deg)\n\n150\n\n180\n\nFigure 4: Differential 2S \u2192 2S cross sections vs. CMS scattering angle \u03b8 for\nthree different laboratory kinetic energies: (a) Mtarget = MH , (b) Mtarget =\nMH2 .\nbody framework. It is seen that a substantial part of the 2S \u2192 2S cross\nsection comes from partial waves with low J, so this result also explains why\nthe uncertainty of the elastic 2S cross section is larger than for the other\nreactions. The semiclassical calculation can be compared with the partial\nwave cross sections by using the relation between the impact parameter \u03c1,\nthe relative momentum k and the angular momentum J\nk\u03c1 = J + 1/2 .\n\n(15)\n\nFor large J (large impact parameter) there is a very good agreement between\nthe semiclassical contribution to the 2S \u2192 2P cross section and the quantum\nmechanical partial wave result. An example of the differential cross sections\nfor the reaction 2S \u2192 2S given in Fig. 4 shows a characteristic pattern with a\nstrong forward peak and a set of maxima and minima, which is in qualitative\nagreement with Ref. [18] where the adiabatic approach was used.\n\n4\n\nThe Surviving Fraction of the Metastable\n(\u03bcp)2S State\n\nThe surviving metastable fraction f (T ) is defined as the probability that\nthe \u03bcp atom in the 2S state with initial kinetic energy T reaches the energy\nbelow the 2P threshold by slowing down in elastic collisions.

It was found that a sizeable fraction of (\u03bcp)2S atoms\nformed at kinetic energies below 1.3 eV slows down below threshold.\nEquation (16) is based on the approximation of continuous energy loss.\nTo provide a more realistic treatment of the evolution in kinetic energy we\nuse a Monte Carlo program based on the differential cross sections for the\nfour processes 2S \u2192 2S, 2S \u2192 2P , 2P \u2192 2S and 2P \u2192 2P . In addition to\nthe collisional processes, the 2P \u2192 1S radiative transition is also included\nin the code. The fate of a \u03bcp formed in the 2S state with kinetic energy T is\nthus either to undergo 2P \u2192 1S radiative transition after the Stark mixing\n2S \u2192 2P or to end up in the 2S state with kinetic energy below the threshold\nwith probability f (T ). Figure 5 shows the rates, \u03bb2l\u21922l\u2032 = N0 v\u03c32l\u21922l\u2032 , for the\ncollisional transitions in liquid hydrogen in comparison with the radiative\ndeexcitation rate \u03bb2P \u21921S . In liquid hydrogen the Stark mixing rates are so\nlarge that the \u03bcp states are expected to be statistically populated for kinetic\nenergies T \u2265 2 eV (where threshold effects can be neglected).\n5\n\nWith our result for the Stark mixing rate 2P \u2192 2S at 1 eV as a function of the target\ndensity N , \u03bb2P \u21922S = N v\u03c32P \u21922S \u2248 4 * 1012 (N/N0 ) s\u22121 where N0 is the liquid hydrogen\ndensity 4.25 * 1022 atoms/cm3 , the range of validity is N \u226a 0.03N0 .\n\n11\n\n\f1.0\n0.8\n\nf(T)\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n3.0\nT (eV)\n\n4.0\n\n5.0\n\nFigure 6: The metastable surviving fraction f (T ) of the (\u03bcp)2S states vs.\ninitial kinetic energy T . The thick and thin solid lines show the results of\nMonte Carlo calculations with Mtarget = MH and Mtarget = MH2 , respectively.\nThe dotted line shows the result of Carboni and Fiorentini [6] and the longdashed line shows f (T ) calculated using the method of Ref. [6] (Eq. (16))\nwith our cross sections. The results are valid for densities N \u2264 10\u22122 N0 .\nFigure 6 shows the surviving fraction f (T ) calculated with the Monte\nCarlo program for target density 10\u22126 < N/N0 < 10\u22122 . The approximation (16) gives somewhat higher values for the survival probability than the\nexact kinetics calculation at T < 1.4 eV. The Monte Carlo results at high energies (T > 1.5 eV) are significantly larger than those obtained from Eq. (16)\nwhere continuous energy loss is assumed. The reason is that the backward\nscattering (see Fig. 4) with maximum possible energy loss plays an important\nrole in bringing the (\u03bcp)2S atoms below the 2P threshold for higher energies.\nIn order to estimate the theoretical uncertainty of f (T ) we performed the\nMonte Carlo calculation with the cross sections obtained in the dipole approximation. In all cases the Monte Carlo calculations are consistent with the\nresults corresponding to the exact potential: at 2 eV the surviving fraction is\nin the range 15 \u2212 20% for atomic target mass and 10 \u2212 16% for molecular target mass. The use of the target mass MH instead of MH2 leads to somewhat\nhigher survival fractions because of a simple kinematical reason: the loss of\nkinetic energy in a collision with the same angle in the CMS is larger for\nthe target of smaller mass and, furthermore, the inelastic threshold is higher\nfor the scattering from the atomic target. Merely substituting the atomic\nmass with the molecular mass for the hydrogen target does not account for\nthe additional energy loss due to rotational and vibrational excitations of\n12\n\n\fH2 . One would therefore expect that the slowing down process is more efficient than this model suggests and the survival probability calculated with\nmolecular target mass is underestimated. The opposite is true for calculations with atomic target: here the transfer of kinetic energy from the \u03bcp to\nthe individual hydrogen atoms is not restricted by molecular bindings. Thus\nresults with atomic target probably give somewhat optimistic results for the\nsurviving fraction.\n\n5\n\nConclusion\n\nThe main results of this paper can be summarized as follows. The detailed\nMonte Carlo kinetics calculations predict the surviving metastable fraction\nof the 2S state of \u03bcp to be larger than 50% for the initial kinetic energy 1 eV\nin agreement with earlier estimates [6]. For higher initial kinetic energies,\nour result is significantly larger than the earlier estimates: the surviving\nmetastable fraction for T = 5 eV is about 4%. This effect is due to a sizeable\ncontribution of backward scattering in elastic collisions.\nOur Monte Carlo calculations are based on the cross sections calculated in\nthe coupled-channel approximation. The main limitation of this method for\nthe problem concerned comes from the use of a small number of atomic states\nto describe the \u03bcp system and the neglect of the molecular structure of the\ntarget. A more accurate treatment of the \u03bcpp three body problem is needed\nin order to do reliable calculations for a few lowest partial wave amplitudes.\nOur approach, however, is well suited for the description of the collisions\nwith the characteristic scale of impact parameters of the order of a0 which\nis exactly the case for the problem involved. Therefore our results provide\na significantly improved basis for a better estimate of the metastable (\u03bcp)2S\nfraction [21] which is very important for the planned Lamb\u2013shift experiment\nat PSI [1].\nFurther details and more results concerning the scattering of the \u03bcp atoms\nin the excited states n \u2265 2 will be published elsewhere.\n\nAcknowledgement\nWe thank P.
