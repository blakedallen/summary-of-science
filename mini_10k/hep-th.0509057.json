Although this means that the SU (3) holonomy group that ensured the existence\nof a covariantly-constant spinor in K6 is enlarged (to U (3) in this case), it is expected that\nsupersymmetry will survive in the deformed background, because of compensating correction terms in the supersymmetry transformation rules. No direct and complete calculation\nof the order \u03b1\u2032 3 corrections to the supersymmetry transformation rules exists, and so a fully\nexplicit proof of the preservation of supersymmetry of the deformed backgrounds has not\nbeen possible. However, in [1] it was noted that the supersymmetry of deformed CalabiYau 6-manifold backgrounds would persist if a certain correction term were added to the\nusual covariant derivative appearing in the gravitino transformation rule. Specifically, the\nproposal in [1] was to modify the usual covariant derivative\n\u2207 = d + 41 \u03c9AB \u0393AB\n\n(1.1)\n\ne = \u2207 + Q, with components given by\nto \u2207\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0001\ne M \u2261 \u2207M + QM = \u2207M \u2212 3c \u03b1\u2032 3 (\u2207N RM P N N ) RN QN N RP Q N N \u0393N1 ***N6 + O \u03b1\u20324 ,\n\u2207\n5 6\n1 2\n3 4\n4\n(1.2)\n\nwhere c is a certain purely numerical constant.

In the case of M-theory backgrounds, the correction terms in question are\nvery similar in form to the tree-level \u03b1\u2032 3 corrections in string theory, but associated now\nwith one-loop string corrections. Specifically, it has been shown that for deformations of\nseven-dimensional G2 holonomy spaces, eight-dimensional Spin(7) holonomy spaces, and\nten-dimensional SU (5) holonomy spaces, the correction (1.2) that was originally proposed\n2\n\n\fpurely for 6-dimensional Calabi-Yau backgrounds is in fact sufficient also to imply the\npreservation of supersymmetry for all the high-dimensional special-holonomy spaces too\n[6, 7].\nIn view of the apparent universality of the correction term in (1.2), and in the absence of\nany other direct calculation of the corrections to the supersymmetry transformation rules,\nit is of interest to pursue further the implications that follow from supposing that (1.2)\nmight in fact be the only relevant correction term. In this paper, we shall study the notion\nof generalised holonomy [8, 9, 10]. However, unlike the earlier work, our focus will be on\nthe modifications to generalised holonomy associated with the inclusion of higher-order\ncorrection terms in string and M-theory.\nIf we consider a purely gravitational background, with vanishing field strengths, then\nfrom (1.3) we see that the generalised structure group is generated by the Dirac matrices\n\u0393M N and \u0393N1 ***N6 . Additionally, one must include any further Dirac matrices that result\nfrom taking commutators of these, until closure is achieved. In D = 11 the 55 matrices \u0393M N\ngenerate SO(1, 10), and these are supplemented by the 462 matrices \u0393N1 ***N6 . The commutators [\u0393M1 ***M6 , \u0393N1 ***N6 ] generate 10-Gamma terms, which are dual to the \u0393M themselves,\ntogether with 6-Gamma and 2-Gamma terms which are already included. Thus in total\nwe obtain closure on the 55 + 462 + 11 = 528 generators {\u0393M N , \u0393M1 ***M6 , \u0393M }. Writing\nM = (0, i), it can be seen that these divide into Hermitean and anti-Hermitean generators\nas follows:\nHermitean :\n\n\u0393i ,\n\n\u03930i ,\n\n\u03930i1 ***i5 ,\n\n10 + 10 + 252 = 272 ,\n\nanti-Hermitean :\n\n\u03930 ,\n\n\u0393ij ,\n\n\u0393i1 ***i6 ,\n\n1 + 45 + 210 = 256 .\n\n(1.4)\n\nThus we have 256 compact generators and 272 non-compact, giving rise to the algebra\nSp(32). This is maximally split, with 256 compact and 256+16 non-compact generators,\nwhere the 16 form the Cartan subalgebra. It should be emphasised that this generalised\nstructure group is specific to D = 11 backgrounds where the 4-form field strength vanishes;\nit is the generalisation of SO(1, 10) that arises due to higher-order corrections in those cases\nwhere the 4-form does not play a r\u00f4le.\nIf one does include the 4-form as well, then in fact the generalised structure group is the\nsame whether or not the higher-order corrections in (1.2) are included. To see this, consider\nfirst the standard leading-order terms in the supercovariant derivative:\nDM = \u2207M \u2212\n\n1\n288\n\nFN1 ***N4 \u0393M N1 ***N4 +\n\n3\n\n1\n36\n\nFM N1 ***N3 \u0393N1 ***N3 .\n\n(1.5)\n\n\fHere, the commutator of supercovariant derivatives gives the \u0393M N , \u0393M1 ***M3 and \u0393M1 ***M5\nmatrices. Denoting \u0393M1 ***Mp collectively by \u0393(p) , we therefore have \u0393(2) , \u0393(3) and \u0393(5) .\nFurther commutators of these will generate in addition \u0393(1) and \u0393(4) . The total numbers\nof {\u0393(1) , \u0393(2) , \u0393(3) , \u0393(4) , \u0393(5) } give 11 + 55 + 165 + 330 + 462 = 1023 generators. These split\ninto Hermitean and anti-Hermitean generators as follows:\nHermitean :\n\n\u0393i , \u03930i , \u03930i1 ***i5 , \u03930ij , \u0393ijkl ,\n\n10 + 10 + 252 + 45 + 210 = 527 ,\n\nanti-Hermitean :\n\n\u03930 , \u0393ij , \u0393i1 ***i6 , \u0393ijk , \u03930ijk ,\n\n1 + 45 + 210 + 120 + 120 = 496 .\n\nIn this case we have 496 compact and 527 non-compact generators, closing on the algebra\nSL(32, R). This is again is maximally split, since we have 496 compact and 496+31 noncompact generators, where the 31 form the Cartan subalgebra. Thus we have reproduced\nthe result in [10], that SL(32, R) is the generalised structure group. Inclusion of the higherorder corrections (1.2) merely adds further \u0393(6) terms, which are equivalent to the \u0393(5) that\nis already present at leading order.\nIn a similar fashion, we may consider the situation in D = 10 in string theory. Again, if\nwe first consider the situation of purely gravitational backgrounds, with all form fields vanishing, then we find that closure is achieved on the set of 45+ 210 = 25 matrices {\u0393(2) , \u0393(6) }.\nThese generate the algebra SL(16, R). Again, if we consider the general case of backgrounds\nwith non-vanishing form fields too, then the inclusion of the higher-order correction term\n(1.2) adds no new Dirac matrix structures, and so one has the same generalised structure\ngroup SL(32, R) as at leading order.\nThe layout of this paper is as follows. In section 2, we introduce the notion of the\n\"Generalised Transverse Structure Group,\" which is defined by viewing the background\nfor a deformed vacuum configuration from the viewpoint of the space transverse to the\nlower-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Effectively, this amounts to performing a KaluzaKlein dimensional reduction on the Minkowski spacetime, allowing us to factor this out and\ndiscuss the generalised structure group (and ultimately, the generalised holonomy group)\npurely from the viewpoint of the n-dimensional transverse space Kn . By this means, we\ncan focus on the generalisation of the standard SO(n) transverse structure group, and\nits special-holonomy subgroup. Of course the Kaluza-Klein reduction amounts to just a\ntrivial direct-product factorisation in cases where the leading-order (Minkowski)\u00d7Kn directproduct structure is preserved by the string or M-theory corrections. However, in the case of\nbackgrounds with an eight or ten-dimensional transverse space, the original direct-product\nstructure is deformed to a warped product by the string or M-theory corrections, and then\n4\n\n\fthe Kaluza-Klein reduction on the Minkowski factor becomes non-trivial.\nIn section 3, we consider the generalised transverse holonomy group for supersymmetric\nbackgrounds of the form (Minkowski)\u00d7K7 , where K7 is a space of G2 holonomy at leading\norder. By considering a specific example of a G2 holonomy space, we show, using some\nresults from [6], how the deformed solution where string or M-theory corrections are included\ncontinues to be supersymmetric, and we determine the associated generalised transverse\nholonomy group. One can see from this result, and the embedding of the generalised\ntransverse holonomy group in the generalised transverse structure group, how it is that\nthere is still a singlet in the decomposition, and hence still a surviving supersymmetry, even\nthough the deformation leads to an enlargement of the standard transverse holonomy from\nG2 to SO(7).\nIn sections 4 and 5, we carry out analogous investigations of the generalised transverse\nholonomy groups for supersymmetric backgrounds of the form (Minkowski)\u00d7Kn for n = 8\nand n = 10. In each case, we consider an example space Kn that initially has special\nholonomy, namely Spin(7) for n = 8, and SU (5) for n = 10. Following the discussions in [6]\nand [7], we show how the supersymmetry is preserved when string or M-theory corrections\nare included, and how the generalised transverse holonomy groups in each case are consistent\nwith the continued existence of a singlet in the decomposition of the generalised transverse\nstructure groups. Finally, in section 6, we end with conclusions, including a summary of\nour results on the generalised transverse structure and holonomy groups in the various\ndimensions.\n\n2\n\nGeneralised Structure Groups in the Transverse Space\n\nWhen considering the holonomy groups of supersymmetric compactifications in M-theory\nor string theory, a full treatment involves addressing this question in the entire D = 11\nor D = 10 spacetime. It is often convenient, however, to factor the discussion into a\nconsideration of the holonomy, or its non-Riemannian generalisation, purely within the\ntransverse space orthogonal to the lower-dimensional spacetime. At leading order, prior\nto the introduction of the higher-order string or M-theory corrections, this is rather clear,\nsince the leading-order supersymmetric backgrounds under discussion are all of the form\n(Minkowski)d \u00d7 Kn , where Kn is a Ricci-flat n-manifold of special holonomy, and d + n = 10\nor 11. Once the higher-order corrections are taken into account, the original direct-product\nbackground may, in some cases, be deformed into a warped product. However, it turns out\n\n5\n\n\fthat we can still discuss the notion of a generalised holonomy group within the n-dimensional\ntransverse space. Before doing this, we must first consider the generalised structure group in\nthe transverse space, which characterises the \"generic\" holonomy of a non-supersymmetric\nvacuum.\nTo be more precise, we shall introduce the notion first of a \"Generalised Transverse\nStructure Group.\" The idea here is the following. The question of principle interest to us in\nthis paper is how the generalised holonomy of deformed supersymmetric backgrounds differs\nfrom their ordinary holonomy at leading order. Additionally, we are interested in seeing\nhow the generalised holonomy of a deformed supersymmetric background differs from the\ngeneralised holonomy of a deformed non-supersymmetric background. The viewpoint that\nwe shall take in all of our discussion is that, wherever the field equations allow, we shall\nconsider purely gravitational backgrounds. If the field equations force the original purelygravitational background to acquire non-vanishing form-field contributions at order \u03b1\u2032 3 in\na perturbative expansion scheme, then we shall (as we must) include such contributions.\nHowever, the only form-field terms we shall consider are those of this kind, which are forced\nby the purely gravitational source-terms. One reason for focussing on such cases is that little\nis known about the correction terms at order \u03b1\u2032 3 involving the form fields in string theory,1\nwhereas the gravitational parts at this order are fully known. As long as one studies in\nperturbation theory up to order \u03b1\u2032 3 , starting from purely gravitational backgrounds, then\nthe lack of knowledge about the form fields is not a problem. However, one cannot start with\nbackgrounds where the form fields are \"large,\" and deform these by order \u03b1\u2032 3 corrections,\ngiven our present incomplete knowledge of the form-field correction terms. Of course, one\ncould allow the form fields to be turned on independently at order \u03b1\u2032 3 , in addition to\nwhatever order \u03b1\u2032 3 contributions are forced by the deformation of a purely gravitational\nbackground, but this would seem to be somewhat artificial, introducing complication but\nlittle extra insight.\nAt leading order, for example, we may consider (Minkowski)d \u00d7 Kn , where d + n = 10\nor 11, and Kn is Ricci-flat. By choosing Kn to have special holonomy rather than generic\nSO(n) holonomy one gets supersymmetric compactifications. One may likewise consider\nthe \u03b1\u2032 3 -induced deformations of the leading-order (Minkowski)d \u00d7 Kn backgrounds, and\nagain make the comparison, now at the level of generalised holonomy, between the cases\nwith and without supersymmetry.\nHaving made the restriction to generalised structure groups for backgrounds which are\n1\n\nPartial results up to terms of the form (DF )2 R2 and (DF )4 have been obtained recently in [11].\n\n6\n\n\fdeformations of purely gravitational leading-order backgrounds, it is then natural to go one\nstep further, and focus where possible on the structure group in the n-dimensional transverse\nspace of the manifold Kn . The situation is most straightforward for n = 6 and n = 7, since\nthen the deformed background retains the direct-product form (Minkowski)d \u00d7Kn , and only\nthe geometry of Kn itself is deformed as a result of the inclusion of the string or M-theory\ncorrections. For n = 8, there are two cases to consider, depending upon whether on the\none hand one is considering tree-level string corrections, in which case the direct-product\nform (Minkowski)d \u00d7 K8 is maintained, or whether on the other hand one is considering\none-loop string or M-theory corrections, in which case the equations force a warped-product\nstructure and a non-vanishing form-field. For the n = 10 case, namely (Minkowski)1 \u00d7 K10\nin M-theory, a warped factorisation again occurs.\nIn all the above cases, whether warped or not, the eleven-dimensional metric describing\nthe deformed solution takes the form\nd\u015d211 = e2\u03b1\u03c6 ds2n + e2\u03b2\u03c6 dx\u03bc dx\u03bc ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere the constants \u03b1 and \u03b2 are related by \u03b2 = \u2212\u03b1(n \u2212 2)/(11 \u2212 n), and, in the case of\nwarped products, \u03c6 is a function of the coordinates on the transverse space whose metric is\nds2n . One can think of performing a dimensional reduction on the flat (11 \u2212 n)-dimensional\nMinkowski spacetime, in which case ds2n acquires an interpretation as the Einstein-frame\nmetric on the lower-dimensional transverse space. Similarly, if the form field is non-zero (in\nthe sense we discussed above), then we perform a standard type of Kaluza-Klein reduction\non this too.\nLet us first consider a generic background of this type, where we do not yet assume\nthat there is any supersymmetry. The generalised transverse structure group is generated\nby the closure of the set of gamma matrices appearing in the dimensional reduction of\nthe supercovariant derivative (1.5), with the corrections (1.2) to the covariant derivative\nincluded. The generalised transverse holonomy group is then defined analogously, for the\nspecific background solution under consideration. If this background is supersymmetric,\nits generalised transverse holonomy group will be a proper subgroup of the generalised\ntransverse structure group.\nIn the following subsections, we shall consider the generalised transverse structure groups\nfor the various dimensions of interest. In particular, for transverse spaces Kn with dimension\nn \u2264 7, the entire discussion can be given in the absence of form fields.\n\n7\n\n\f2.1\n\nGeneralised transverse structure group for n = 6\n\nWe are considering here situations where the undeformed background is purely gravitational,\nwith no form fields turned on. In cases where the curvature in this background is confined\nto six dimensions, the \u03b1\u2032 3 -corrected equations of motion do not lead to any non-vanishing\nsources for the form fields, in this perturbative discussion, and so the background will remain\npurely gravitational. From (1.2) and (1.3), we see that the commutators of supercovariant\nderivatives will yield terms involving \u0393(2) and \u0393(6) in the six dimensions, where we again\nuse the notation \u0393(p) to denote the set of all p-index antisymmetrised Dirac matrices \u0393i1 ***ip .\nIn six dimensions \u0393(6) is simply proportional to i\u03937 , where \u03937 is the chirality operator in\nD = 6 (squaring to +1). It is then easy to see that the set of matrices \u0393(2) and \u03937 close\nunder commutation, giving the generalised transverse structure group SO(6) \u00d7 U (1).\n\n2.2\n\nGeneralised transverse structure group for n = 7\n\nIn this case, since the form fields can again remain zero when the higher-order string theory or M-theory corrections are taken into account, it again suffices to consider just the\ngravitationally-corrected covariant derivative appearing in (1.2). In a generic curved background, the structure group associated with (1.2) will be generated by the Dirac matrices\n\u0393(2) and \u0393(6) , together with any additional matrices required by closure. In n = 7 dimensions \u0393(6) is dual to \u0393(1) , and so we immediately achieve closure on the matrices \u0393(2) and\n\u0393(1) . These generate the group SO(8). Thus we conclude that for the class of purely gravitational seven-dimensional backgrounds that we are considering here, the standard SO(7)\nstructure group (the tangent-space group) is enlarged to the generalised transverse structure\ngroup SO(8).\n\n2.3\n\nGeneralised transverse structure group for n = 8\n\nThe discussion of the generalised transverse structure group in K8 for backgrounds of the\nform (Minkowski)\u00d7K8 at leading order takes a sightly different form depending on whether\none is considering the effect of tree-level corrections in string theory, or alternatively 1loop string corrections or (equivalently) M-theory corrections. In the case of tree-level\ncorrections in string theory, an initial purely gravitational background (Minkowski)2 \u00d7 K8\nremains purely gravitational, in the sense that the corrected equations of motion do not\nrequire that form fields become non-zero.\nIf, on the other hand, we consider the effect of 1-loop string corrections or M-theory\n\n8\n\n\fcorrections, the equations of motion now imply that form fields must also become nonvanishing, and furthermore that the ten-dimensional or eleven-dimensional metric deforms\ninto a warped product. The discussion of the one-loop string and the M-theory cases\nis essentially identical, and so when we consider this situation we shall, for definiteness,\ndiscuss it in the context of M-theory.\nLet us first, however, consider the situation at tree level. We need only consider the\ngeneralised structure group for the modified covariant derivative given in (1.2). The \u0393(6)\nterms in (1.2) can be dualised to \u03939 \u0393(2) , and thus we achieve closure on the matrices \u0393ij\nand \u03939 \u0393ij . If we define\n+\nXij\n= 12 (1 + \u03939 ) \u0393ij ,\n\n\u2212\nXij\n= 12 (1 \u2212 \u03939 ) \u0393ij ,\n\n(2.2)\n\n+\n\u2212\nit is immediately apparent that the Xij\nand Xij\nmatrices generate two commuting copies\n\nof SO(8), which we shall denote by SO(8)+ and SO(8)\u2212 respectively. Thus the generalised transverse structure group for purely gravitational 8-dimensional transverse spaces is\nSO(8)+ \u00d7 SO(8)\u2212 .\nTurning now to M-theory, it is known that in addition to the corrections to the Einstein\nequation for the internal space K8 , the corrections to the form-field equation imply that\nF(4) must become non-zero [12, 13, 14, 15, 7, 16]. Specifically, in a perturbative analysis of\nthe deformation of the leading-order solution, one finds that the eleven-dimensional metric\nwarps, assuming the form\nd\u015d211 = e2A dx\u03bc dx\u03bc + e\u2212A ds28 ,\n\n(2.3)\n\nF\u0302(4) = d3 x \u2227 df .\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhilst the 4-form is given by\n\nThe warp factor A [14, 7, 16] and the scalar f satisfy\nA=\n\n\u03b2\nY2 ,\n1728\n\nf = m\u03b2 (2\u03c0)4 \u2217X(8) ,\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhere Y2 is a certain multiple of the eight-dimensional Euler integrand,\nY2 =\n\n315 [M1 M2\nM1 M2\n2 R\u0302\n\n* * * R\u0302M7 M8 ] M7 M8 .\n\n(2.6)\n\nand the 8-form X(8) is given by\nX(8) =\n\n1\n[tr \u03984 \u2212 14 (tr \u03982 )2 ] ,\n192 (2\u03c0)4\n\n9\n\n(2.7)\n\n\fFor this general class of warped backgrounds, the supercovariant derivative in the eight\ntransverse dimensions takes the form [7]\nD\u0302i = 1l \u2297 \u2207i \u2212 14 \u2202j A 1l \u00d7 \u0393i j \u2212\n\n1\n12 \u2202j f\n\n1l \u2297 \u0393i j \u03939 + 16 \u2202i f 1l \u2297 \u03939 + 1l \u2297 Qi ,\n\n(2.8)\n\nwhere \u0393i denotes the Dirac matrices in the eight-dimensional transverse space, and \u03939 is the\nassociated chirality operator. From (2.8), one can show [7] that the configurations discussed\nin [12, 13, 15, 7, 16] are supersymmetric at the leading order in the expansion parameter \u03b2.\nWe also see that the algebra generated by their commutators again closes on the generators\n\u0393(2) and \u03939 \u0393(2) , and so again we conclude that the generalised transverse structure group\nis SO(8)+ \u00d7 SO(8)\u2212 .\n\n2.4\n\nGeneralised transverse structure group for n = 10\n\nConfigurations with a ten-dimensional curved transverse space can be discussed only in\nM-theory.\n\nAgain, it has been shown that a solution that is simply a direct product\n\n(Minkowski)1 \u00d7 K10 at leading order becomes deformed into a warped product, with a\nnon-vanishing 4-form field, when the M-theory corrections are taken into account [7]. In\nthis case, therefore, we must necessarily include the effect of the 4-form in the discussion.\nThe form of the warped-product metric is [7]\n1\n\nd\u015d211 = \u2212e2A dt2 + e\u2212 4 A ds210 ,\n\n(2.9)\n\nF\u0302(4) = G(3) \u2227 dt .\n\n(2.10)\n\nwhilst the 4-form is given by\n\nIn the ten-dimensional internal space the supercovariant derivative is then given by [7]\nD\u0302i = \u2207i \u2212\n\nij\n1\n16 \u2207j A \u0393\n\n+\n\njkl\ni\n\u039311\n72 Gjkl \u0393i\n\n\u2212\n\ni\n12 Gijk\n\n\u0393jk \u039311 + Qi ,\n\n(2.11)\n\nwhen expressed in terms of the ten-dimensional SO(10) Dirac matrices \u0393i , and the tendimensional chirality operator \u039311 . It therefore follows that the commutators of supercovariant derivatives close on the matrices\n{\u0393(2) , \u0393(4) , i \u039311 \u0393(2) , i \u039311 \u0393(4) }\n\n(2.12)\n\nin the transverse ten-dimensional space. These divide into Hermitean and anti-Hermitean\ngenerators as follows:\nHermitean :\nanti-Hermitean :\n\ni \u0393ij \u039311 ,\n\u0393ij ,\n\n\u0393ijkl ,\n\n45 + 210 = 255 ,\n\ni \u0393ijkl \u039311 ,\n\n45 + 210 = 255 ,\n\n10\n\n(2.13)\n\n\fand so we have 255 compact and 255 non-compact generators. The 255 compact generators\n\u0393ij and i \u0393ijkl \u039311 close on SU (16), and the complete set of generators form the algebra\nSL(16, C). Thus the generalised transverse structure group for deformations of original\n(Minkowski)1 \u00d7 K10 backgrounds is SL(16, C).\nIt is worth emphasising that the situation in this case of (Minkowski)1 \u00d7K10 backgrounds\nin M-theory is quite different from the (Minkowski)\u00d7Kn for 6 \u2264 n \u2264 8 examples that we\ndiscussed previously, in that here we are finding a non-compact generalised structure group,\neven though we are focusing purely on the Euclidean-signature ten-dimensional transverse\nspace.\nIn the following sections, we shall study the generalised transverse holonomy groups\nthat arise when considering string or M-theory backgrounds of the form (Minkowski)\u00d7Kn ,\nwhere at leading order Kn is a special-holonomy space of dimension n = 7, 8 or 10. Before\nmoving on to considering these cases, we note that the case of (Minkowski)\u00d7K6 backgrounds\nwas effectively already been discussed in the earlier literature [1]. In this case, the effect\nof including the higher-order corrections is to introduce \u0393(6) terms that are dual to i \u03937\nin K6 , and so the leading-order SU (3) special holonomy of the Calabi-Yau background\nis enlarged to SU (3) \u00d7 U (1). This extra U (1) factor generated by i \u03937 is cancelled by a\nU (1) contribution proportional to J ij \u0393ij coming from the spin connection of the deformed\nbackground when the supercovariant derivative acts on a Killing spinor, thus implying\nthat supersymmetry is preserved. As we shall see in the following sections, the cases of\n(Minkowski)\u00d7Kn backgrounds with n > 6 lead to less trivial enlargements of the holonomy\ngroups.\n\n3\n\nGeneralisation of G2 Transverse Holonomy\n\nIn section 2.2, we showed that the generalised transverse structure group for purely gravitational seven-dimensional backgrounds is SO(8), which represents an enhancement of\nthe standard SO(7) Riemannian structure group. In this section we shall examine the\ngeneralised transverse holonomy group for supersymmetric solutions with such a sevendimensional curved transverse space. Specifically, we shall be interested in the supersymmetric backgrounds of the form (Minkowski)4 \u00d7K7 at leading order, where K7 is a Ricci-flat\nmetric of G2 holonomy, and the deformations of these backgrounds in the face of higher-order\nstring or M-theory corrections. As was shown in [6], the deformed backgrounds continue\nto be supersymmetric, despite the fact that K7 is deformed away from G2 holonomy, pre-\n\n11\n\n\fcisely because the supercovariant derivative appearing in the gravitino transformation rule\nacquires the correction appearing in (1.2).\nAt the leading order, the embedding of the G2 holonomy group in SO(7) is such that\nthe 8 spinor representation of SO(7) decomposes to 1 + 7, with the singlet indicating\nthe occurrence of a covariantly-constant spinor, i.e. a Killing spinor, in the G2 -holonomy\nbackground. To study the situation once the string or M-theory corrections are taken into\naccount, we shall take a specific example of a G2 -holonomy metric on K7 , and study the\ngeneralised holonomy after the deformation of the metric implied by the corrected equations\nof motion has been determined.\nAs a specific example, we take the cohomogeneity one 7-metric with S 3 \u00d7 S 3 principal\norbits, which was first constructed in [17, 18]:\nds27 = dr 2 + a2 (\u03c3i \u2212 \u03a3i )2 + b2 (\u03c3i + \u03a3i )2 ,\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere \u03c3i and \u03a3i are left-invariant 1-forms for two copies of SU (2). The metric has G2\nholonomy if\n\nb\na\u2032\n+ 2 = 0,\na\n2a\n\nb\nb\u2032\n1\n\u2212 2+\n= 0.\nb\n4a\n4b\n\n(3.2)\n\nIn this example, the effect of the string corrections at order \u03b1\u2032 3 is simply to deform\nthe metric on K7 , as discussed in [6]. Since no form fields are involved in the deformed\nbackground, we need simply consider the modified covariant derivative appearing in (1.2).\nBefore including the \u03b1\u2032 3 corrections, a straightforward calculation shows that the integrability condition\n[\u2207i , \u2207j ] = 14 Rijkl \u0393kl\n\n(3.3)\n\nselects the 14-dimensional subset (Xa , H1 , H2 ), 1 \u2264 a \u2264 12, of the 21 SO(7) generators \u0393ij ,\ngiven by\nX1 = \u039301\u0302 \u2212 \u039323 ,\n\nX2 = \u039302\u0302 \u2212 \u039331 ,\n\nX3 = \u039303\u0302 \u2212 \u039312 ,\n\nX4 = \u039301\u0302 + \u03932\u03023\u0302 ,\n\nX5 = \u039302\u0302 + \u03933\u03021\u0302 ,\n\nX6 = \u039303\u0302 + \u03931\u03022\u0302 ,\n\nX7 = \u039301 \u2212 \u039323\u0302 ,\n\nX8 = \u039302 \u2212 \u039331\u0302 ,\n\nX9 = \u039303 \u2212 \u039312\u0302 ,\n\nX10 = \u039301 + \u039332\u0302 ,\nH1 = 2i (\u039311\u0302 \u2212 \u039322\u0302 ) ,\n\nX11 = \u039302 + \u039313\u0302 ,\nH2 = 2i (\u039322\u0302 \u2212 \u039333\u0302 ) ,\n\nX12 = \u039303 + \u039321\u0302 ,\n(3.4)\n\nwhere we use the notation that the indices i = (1\u0302, 2\u0302, 3\u0302) denote i = (4, 5, 6), in order to\nemphasise the cyclic symmetry of the definitions. A straightforward calculation shows that\n\n12\n\n\f(Xa , H1 , H2 ) generate the expected G2 holonomy algebra, with the simple-root generators\ngiven by\nE\u03b11 = X1 \u2212 X4 \u2212 i X7 + i X10 ,\n\nE\u03b12 = X3 + X6 \u2212 i X9 \u2212 i X12 ,\n\n(3.5)\n\nand having weights \u03b11 = (1, \u22122), \u03b12 = (0, 1) under the Cartan generators (H1 , H2 ).

In this section we\nhave shown that the generalised transverse holonomy group for a deformed G2 -holonomy\nbackground enlarges to SO(7). This is consistent with the continued existence of a Killing\nspinor, with spinors in the 8 representation of SO(8) decomposing to 1 + 7 under the\ngeneralised transverse holonomy subgroup SO(7).\n\n4\n\nGeneralisation of Spin(7) Transverse Holonomy\n\nIn section 2.3, we showed that the structure group in the eight-dimensional transverse\nspace for backgrounds of the form (Minkowski)\u00d7K8 is augmented from the usual SO(8)\nRiemannian group to SO(8)+ \u00d7 SO(8)\u2212 when the effects of higher-order corrections in\nstring or M-theory are taken into account. In this section, we shall study the corresponding generalised transverse holonomy group that arises when one studies the corrections to\nleading-order supersymmetric Spin(7) holonomy backgrounds.\nFor a concrete example, we shall start from the Spin(7) holonomy metric on the R4\nbundle over S 4 , which was first constructed in [17, 18]. This metric is contained within the\ncohomogeneity-1 class of metrics\nds28 = dr 2 + a(r)2 Ri2 + b(r)2 Pa2 ,\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere Ri , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 3 and Pa , 1 \u2264 a \u2264 4, are left-invariant 1-forms in the coset S 7 \u223c\nSO(5)/SO(3), as described in [19]. It is convenient to use an orthonormal basis\ne0 = dr ,\n\nei = a Ri ,\n\ne4 = b P0\n14\n\ne\u00ee = b P\u00ee ,\n\n(4.2)\n\n\fwhere \u00ee corresponds to the index values 5, 6, 7 as i ranges over 1, 2, 3. At leading order, prior\nto the inclusion of higher-order corrections, the metric has Riemannian holonomy Spin(7)\nif the functions a and b satisfy the first-order equations [19]\na\u2032 = 1 \u2212\n\na2\n,\n2b2\n\nb\u2032 =\n\n3a\n.\n4b\n\n(4.3)\n\nAfter some algebra, we find that the commutators [\u2207i , \u2207j ] = 14 Rijkl \u0393kl indeed select a 21dimensional subset of the 28 SO(8) generators \u0393ij , which generate the algebra of Spin(7)\n\u2282 SO(8). These are given by the 6 generators\n\u039301 + \u039341\u0302 ,\n\n\u039323 + \u039341\u0302 ,\n\n\u039341\u0302 \u2212 \u03932\u03023\u0302 ,\n\n\u039301\u0302 \u2212 \u039332\u0302 ,\n\n\u039301\u0302 + \u039323\u0302 ,\n\n2\u039314 \u2212 \u039323\u0302 + \u039332\u0302 ,\n\n(4.4)\n\ntogether with 12 more obtained by cyclic permutation of 1, 2, 3, and a 3 further generators\ngiven by\nHi = 2i (\u039304 \u2212 \u0393i \u00ee ) ,\n\n1 = 1, 2, 3 .\n\n(4.5)\n\nWe can take the Hi to be the Cartan generators, and we find that the remaining 18 generators can be organised into 9 positive-root generators and 9 negative-roots generators, with\nthe three simple-root generators\nE\u03b11\n\n= \u2212i \u039301 + i \u039323 + i \u039341\u0302 \u2212 i \u03932\u03023\u0302 \u2212 \u039301\u0302 + \u039314 \u2212 \u039323\u0302 + \u039332\u0302 ,\n\nE\u03b12\n\n= i \u039312 + i \u03931\u03022\u0302 + \u039312\u0302 + \u039321\u0302 ,\n\nE\u03b13\n\n= i \u039323 + i \u03932\u03023\u0302 + \u039323\u0302 + \u039332\u0302 .\n\n(4.6)\n\nThe remaining roots\n\u03b11 + \u03b12 ,\n\n\u03b12 + \u03b13 ,\n\n2\u03b11 + \u03b12 ,\n\n\u03b11 + \u03b12 + \u03b13 ,\n\n2\u03b11 + \u03b1 + 2 + \u03b13 ,\n\n2\u03b11 + 2\u03b12 + \u03b13 , (4.7)\n\narising from the corresponding commutation of the simple roots, complete the positive roots\nof Spin(7) and, together with their conjugates, fill out the generators found above.\nWhen the string or M-theory corrections are taken into account, we obtain extra terms\narising from the commutators of the supercovariant derivatives D\u0302i given in (2.8). These\nterms have a rather specific structure, which can be described as follows. Regardless of\nwhether we consider tree-level string corrections, or one-loop string/M-theory corrections,\nthe extra terms coming from \u2207i itself in the deformed background combine with the terms\nfrom Qi in such a way that we get precisely the chirally-projected matrices\n1\n2 (1\n\n+ \u03939 ) \u0393ij .\n15\n\n(4.8)\n\n\fThese generate the full SO(8)+ algebra. In the case where we consider one-loop string\nor M-theory corrections, the functions f and A are non-zero, but related to each other\naccording to f = 3A [7]. This means that again, the further terms arising in the corrected\ncommutators all have the chiral structure (4.8). The crucial point is that as far as the\nnegative chiral projection 12 (1 \u2212 \u03939 ) \u0393ij is concerned, no new contributions arise when the\nhigher-order corrections are taken into account.\nThe upshot of the above discussion is that whether one looks at the tree-level corrections\nin string theory, or at the one-loop string or M-theory corrections, the effect is to introduce\nthe full complement of 28 generators of SO(8)+ , but to leave the structure of negativechiral projected generators\n\n1\n2 (1\n\n\u2212 \u03939 ) \u0393ij unaltered from their leading-order uncorrected\n\nform. In other words, the full set of Dirac matrices that arises for the corrected solutions\ncomprises the 28 generators of SO(8)+ , and the 21 generators of Spin(7)\u2212 . In other words,\nthe generalised transverse holonomy group for the deformed (Minkowski)\u00d7K8 backgrounds\nis the augmentation of the original undeformed Spin(7)\u2282 SO(8) to\nSO(8)+ \u00d7 Spin(7)\u2212 \u2282 SO(8)+ \u00d7 SO(8)\u2212 .\n\n(4.9)\n\nNote that again we have the property that there is a singlet in the decomposition of spinors\nof the generalised structure group under the generalised holonomy subgroup, which is consistent with the findings of [7] that supersymmetry is preserved by the higher-order corrections.\n\n5\n\nGeneralisation of SU (5) Transverse Holonomy\n\nWe now turn to the discussion of the generalised transverse holonomy group for deformations\nof (Minkowski)1 \u00d7 K10 supersymmetric backgrounds in M-theory, where K10 is initially a\nRicci-flat K\u00e4hler 10-manifold, with SU (5) holonomy. The details of the corrected solutions\nwere discussed in [7]. It was found that again, as in the lower-dimensional cases, the\ndeformed solution remains supersymmetric, even though the 10-dimensional metric ceases\nto have SU (5) special holonomy. In fact in this case, the deformed metric does not even\nremain K\u00e4hler, although K10 is still a complex manifold [7]. It should be noted that the\ndeformed eleven-dimensional solution takes the warped-product form described by (2.9),\nand furthermore, the 4-form field strength is non-vanishing, taking the form F\u0302(4) = G(3) \u2227 dt\n[7].\nFor a concrete example, we shall consider a ten-dimensional metric of the form\nds210 = dr 2 + a2 (d\u03a921 + d\u03a922 + d\u03a923 + d\u03a924 ) + b2 (d\u03c4 + A)2 ,\n16\n\n(5.1)\n\n\fwhere d\u03a92i denotes the metric on the i'th of four unit 2-spheres, and dA =\n\nP\n\ni \u03a9i ,\n\nwhere \u03a9i\n\nis the volume form on the i'th 2-sphere. The functions a, b and c depend only on r, and\nthe metric has SU (5) holonomy if they satisfy the first-order equations\na\u2032 =\n\nb\n,\n2a\n\nb\u2032 = 1 \u2212\n\n2b2\n.\na2\n\n(5.2)\n\nIn what follows, we shall adopt a vielbein basis given by\ne1 = a d\u03b81 ,\n\ne2 = a sin \u03b81 d\u03c61 ,\n\ne3 = a d\u03b82 ,\n\ne4 = a sin \u03b82 d\u03c62 ,\n\ne5 = a d\u03b83 ,\n\ne6 = a sin \u03b83 d\u03c63 ,\n\ne7 = a d\u03b84 ,\n\ne8 = a sin \u03b84 d\u03c64 ,\n\ne0 = b (d\u03c4 + A) ,\n\ne9 = dr .\n\n(5.3)\n\nIt is straightforward (with the aid of a computer) to work out the corrected first-order\nequations that arise from imposing the conditions derived in [7], and to determine the warp\nfactor A in (2.9) and the non-vanishing 4-form field strength for this deformed solution.\nFrom this information, one can then construct the deformed supercovariant derivative operator, and hence read off the generators of the generalised holonomy group.\nWe find that after including multiple commutators until closure is achieved, there are\nin total 217 generators of the generalised transverse holonomy group in our example. They\nare all, of course, contained within the set of 510 generators of the SL(16, C) generalised\ntransverse structure group listed in (2.13). Before presenting some details of our results, we\nshall first summarise the conclusions. After manipulations that are again best performed\nwith the aid of a computer, we find that there is a Cartan subalgebra of dimension 17,\nand there are a further 120 of the 217 generators that all commute with each other. The\nremaining 80 generators, together with 16 of the Cartan generators, give rise to the algebra\nSL(5, C) \u00d7 SL(5, C). The 17'th Cartan generator is compact, and we find that the complete\ngroup is of the general form\n[U (1) \u00d7 SL(5, C) \u00d7 SL(5, C)] \u22c9 R120 ,\n\n(5.4)\n\nwhere the symbol \u22c9 denotes a semi-direct product. Specifically, we find that the 120\nmutually-commuting factors in R120 assemble in the form\n(10,1)\n\nC1\n\n(10,5)\n\n\u2295 C3\n\n,\n\n(5.5)\n\nwhere the superscripts denote the representations under the left and right SL(5, C) factors,\nand the subscripts denote the charges under the 17'th Cartan generator associated with the\nU (1) factor in (5.4).\n17\n\n\fThe construction of the 16 Cartan generators of SL(5, C)\u00d7SL(5, C) is as follows.

The (10, 1)\nrepresentation can be generated from the highest-weight generator, whose weight-vector is\n{1, 1, 1, 0}; it is given by\nV\n\n= (1 \u2212 \u039310 )(x + i y) ,\n\nx = \u039308 + \u039379 \u2212 (\u039307 \u2212 \u039389 )(\u039312 + \u039334 + \u039356 ) ,\ny = \u039307 \u2212 \u039389 + (\u039308 + \u039379 )(\u039312 + \u039334 + \u039356 ) .\n\n(5.13)\n\nIt is straightforward to verify that the 10 generators commute with the right-hand SL(5, C).\nThese generators all have eigenvalue +1 under H17 , whilst their conjugates (1 + G10 )(x \u2212 iy)\nhave eigenvalue \u22121.\nThe (10, 5) generators can be generated analogously from the highest-weight generator\n\u0010\nU = (1 \u2212 \u039310 ) (\u039301 + \u039329 )(\u039336 + \u039345 ) + (\u039302 \u2212 \u039319 )(\u039335 \u2212 \u039346 )\n\u0011\n+i (\u039301 + \u039329 )(\u2212\u039335 + \u039346 ) + i (\u039302 \u2212 \u039319 )(\u039336 + \u039345 ) , (5.14)\n\nwhich, has weight-vector {1, 1, 1, 0} under the left-hand SL(5, C) and {1, 1, 1, 1} under\nthe right-hand SL(5, C). The resulting (10, 5) generators all have weight 3 under the\nCartan generator H17 . This completes the demonstration that for the supersymmetric\n(Minkowski)\u00d7K10 background that we have considered here, the generalised transverse\nholonomy group is\n(10,1)\n\n[U (1) \u00d7 SL(5, C) \u00d7 SL(5, C)] \u22c9 [C1\n19\n\n(10,5)\n\n\u2295 C3\n\n].\n\n(5.15)\n\n\fNote that just as the transverse structure group SL(16, C) of this (Minkowski)\u00d7K10\nbackground is non-compact, so too is the generalised transverse holonomy group that we\nhave obtained here. Although it is perhaps not immediately apparent, there is, as the\npreservation of supersymmetry tells us there must be, a singlet in the decomposition of\nthe 16-dimensional representation of the generalised transverse structure group SL(16, C)\nunder the generalised holonomy subgroup (5.15). An easy, if rather mechanical, way to\nsee this is simply to note that there exists a spinor which is annihilated by all 217 of the\ngeneralised holonomy-group generators.\nThe result that we have obtained here for the generalised transverse holonomy group\n(5.15) is considerably more complicated, and at the same time more degenerate, than the\ntype of groups we encountered for lower-dimensional transverse spaces. One might suspect\nthat this could be a consequence of having chosen in (5.1) a rather special and simple example for the type of deformed SU (5)-holonomy metric. It might well be that with a more\ngeneric type of example, for which the curvature tensor had a larger number of non-zero\neigenvalues, one would find a less degenerate-looking generalised holonomy group. Unfortunately the computational difficulties associated with using a more complicated example\nhave prevented us from pursuing this question further.\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper, we have studied the effect of higher-order corrections in string and M-theory\non the holonomy groups of supersymmetric backgrounds. In order to do this, we have made\nuse of the notion of generalised holonomy, which was introduced in [8, 9, 10]. In the earlier\nworks on the subject, the focus was on supersymmetric backgrounds in string or M-theory\nat the leading order, but where form fields were turned on, leading to the need to generalise\nthe usual notion of Riemannian structure and holonomy groups. In the present paper, by\ncontrast, our principal focus has been on purely gravitational backgrounds, but taking into\naccount the effect of higher-order corrections to the equations of motion, and the supersymmetry transformation rules. The latter imply that the structure group and holonomy group\nwill already be generalised and enlarged, because the corrections to the supersymmetry\ntransformation rules introduce new gamma-matrix terms in the supercovariant derivative.\nIn some cases, for transverse spaces of dimension eight or ten, the corrected equations\nof motion require that the form fields that started out zero in the leading-order solution\nmust become non-zero, and this can further enlarge the generalised structure and holon-\n\n20\n\n\fomy groups. One of the motivations for our investigation was to study how, at the level of\nthe generalised structure group and its generalised holonomy subgroup, the deformation implied by the corrections to the string or M-theory equations can still yield a supersymmetric\nbackground even though the ordinary holonomy group is enlarged from special holonomy\nto generic holonomy. Our study focused on the generalised structure groups and holonomy\ngroups restricted to the transverse space, since this captures the essence of the non-trivial\nnature of the background solutions.\nOur results can be conveniently summarised in two tables. First, in Table 1, for completeness, we list the standard structure groups and holonomy groups in the transverse\nspaces Kn for dimensions n = 6, 7, 8 and 10. Then, in Table 2, we list our findings for\nthe analogous generalised structure groups and holonomy groups for each of the transverse\ndimensions n = 6, 7, 8 and 10, where the effect of the known string or M-theory corrections\nto the leading-order equations are taken into account. In each table, the structure group\ncan be thought of as the holonomy group for a generic non-supersymmetric background,\nwhilst the holonomy groups that we list are for supersymmetric backgrounds.\nn\n\nStructure Group\n\nHolonomy Group\n\n6\n\nSO(6)\n\nSU (3)\n\n7\n\nSO(7)\n\nG2\n\n8\n\nSO(8)\n\nSpin(7)\n\n10\n\nSO(10)\n\nSU (5)\n\nTable 1: The structure group for the transverse space Kn and the holonomy group for a\nsupersymmetric background, at leading order in string or M-theory.\n\nn\n\nStructure Group\n\nHolonomy Group\n\n6\n\nSO(6) \u00d7 U (1)\n\nSU (3) \u00d7 U (1)\n\n7\n\nSO(8)\n\nSO(7)\n\n8\n\nSO(8)+ \u00d7 SO(8)\u2212\n\nSO(8)+ \u00d7Spin(7)\u2212\n\n10\n\nSL(16, C)\n\n[U (1) \u00d7 SL(5, C) \u00d7 SL(5, C)] \u22c9 [C(10,1) \u2295 C(10,5) ]\n\nTable 2: The generalised structure group for the transverse space Kn and the generalised\nholonomy group for a supersymmetric background, including higher-order corrections in\nstring or M-theory.\n\n21\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to Paul Townsend for discussions.
