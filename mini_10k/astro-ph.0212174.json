For main sequence primary stars, faint\nlow mass companions are often hidden in the glare of the more luminous primary, and radial\nvelocity variations are small and therefore difficult to detect. On the other hand, observing\nlow mass companions to white dwarfs (WDs) offers many advantages compared to main\nsequence primaries. Since WDs are less luminous than main sequence stars, the brightness\ncontrast compared to a potential faint companion is significantly reduced. Most importantly,\nthe markedly different spectral energy distributions of the WDs and their low mass companions makes the detection and separation of the two components relatively straightforward\neven with simple broad-band multi-color photometry.\nBecause WDs have traditionally been identified and studied via observations in the blue\npart of the spectrum, comparatively little is known about their infrared (IR) properties. The\nrecent discovery that very cool WDs are much bluer in the IR than previously thought to be\nthe case (Hodgkin et al. 2000) highlights how little is known about WD spectral properties at\nlonger wavelengths. Consequently, we are studying the group near-IR photometric properties\nof WDs. In this paper, we present analysis of the near-IR color-color diagram of WDs, which\ndemonstrates a means of identifying candidates for WDs with close (unresolved), cool, low\nmass stellar or sub-stellar companions.\n\n2.\n\nTarget Selection and Identification\n\nWe selected the WDs in our sample from the catalog of spectroscopically identified WDs\nby McCook & Sion (1999, hereafter, MS99). We extracted all WDs from MS99 that are\ncontained in the sky coverage of the 2MASS Second Incremental Data Release (2IDR; e.g.,\nSkrutskie et al. 1995, 1997)1 . Due to potentially large and often unknown proper motions,\nand other uncertainties in published positions, we first identified each WD in optical images\nfrom the Digitized Sky Survey (DSS). The WD in the optical image was then matched with\nsources in the 2MASS 2IDR images and point source catalog. Our identification of the\noptical counterpart was based on published finding charts whenever possible; for example,\nusing the charts in the LHS atlas (Luyten & Albers 1979), the Giclas proper motion survey\nand lists of suspected WDs (e.g., Giclas 1958 through Giclas, Burnham, & Thomas 1980),\nand the Montreal-Cambridge-Tololo survey (Lamontagne et al. 2000), to name only a few\n1\n\nAlso see http://pegasus.phast.umass.edu/.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nsources. The WDs for which no finding chart could be located in the literature were identified\nfrom a combination of published coordinates, proper motion, and color in the DSS images.\nA catalog detailing accurate J2000 positions together with references to individual finding\ncharts and our method(s) of identification will be presented in a future paper.\n\n2.1.\n\nNumber Statistics\n\nMS99 list 2249 spectroscopically identified WDs, 1235 of which are located in the sky\ncoverage of the 2MASS 2IDR. For 47 WDs, we could not (re)establish an optical identification. This was mainly due to insufficient accuracy in the published finding charts and/or\ncoordinates that made it impossible to decide with confidence between several stars close to\nthe given positions. In some cases, WDs listed in MS99 have subsequently been reclassified\nas AGN, Seyfert galaxies, or hot subdwarfs. A few WDs appear in MS99 multiple times\nunder different designations. For 27 WDs, no IR magnitudes could be obtained from the\n2MASS 2IDR point source catalog despite having an identified optical counterpart. In the\nmajority of cases, this is due to blending of the WD with unrelated field stars in the 2MASS\nimages. Detailed comments on particularly problematic identifications will be provided in a\nfuture paper.\nThe 2MASS completeness limits (defined by photometry with signal-to-noise of S/N >\n10) are J = 15.8, H = 15.1, and Ks = 14.3. The survey detection limits are approximately\none magnitude fainter in each band. Of the 1161 WDs for which we could establish secure\nidentifications, 759 are detected in the 2MASS 2IDR with varying degrees of accuracy. The\nremaining 402 WDs are undetected, meaning that while we have securely identified an IR\ncounterpart for these WDs, there is no corresponding entry in the 2MASS 2IDR point source\ncatalog. Many of the formally undetected WDs appear to lie just below the detection limits\nof the survey, as faint objects are often visible in the 2MASS images at the correct positions.\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nAnalysis and Discussion\nThe IR Color-Color Diagram\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the results of our study as a near-IR color-color diagram of WDs. We\nhave plotted all WDs detected in the 2MASS 2IDR, together with the fiducial tracks of the\nmain sequence and the region occupied by L dwarfs. The positions of the spectral type labels\nare offset horizontally for A0\u2013K5, and vertically for M0\u2013M8. The main sequence data up\nto M5 were taken from Bessell & Brett (1988) and transformed to the 2MASS photometric\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nsystem using the relations in Carpenter (2001), while the colors for late-M and L dwarfs\nrepresent mean 2MASS observational data from Gizis et al. (2000) and Kirkpatrick et al.\n(2000). The points are symbol-coded according to the 1-\u03c3 uncertainties of the original IR\nmagnitudes: large filled circles = \u03c3 < 0.1 mag for J, H, and Ks ; small filled circles = \u03c3 > 0.1\nmag for at least one of J, H, or Ks ; small unfilled circles = at least one magnitude is close\nto the 2MASS faint detection limit and lacks a formal uncertainty.\nIf we examine only the data points with the smallest uncertainties (large filled circles),\nthen our color-color diagram exhibits two prominent concentrations of points. One group is\nclustered around the main sequence track of early spectral types to about K0, and another\ngroup is clustered around the locus of main sequence M stars. We expect that the former\ngroup contains isolated WDs and the WD components of wide (resolved2 ) binaries. The latter\ngroup contains close (unresolved) binaries consisting of a WD and a low mass main sequence\ncompanion, in which the red spectral energy distribution of the companion dominates the\noverall color.\nIn Figure 2, we show the near-IR color-color diagram of 152 single, cool WDs (large\nblack circles) from the study of Bergeron et al. (2001). The data have been transformed from\nthe CIT to the 2MASS photometric system using the relations in Carpenter (2001). Typical\nphotometric uncertainties in the transformed Bergeron data are about 5%, with a few objects\nhaving larger uncertainties on the order of 10%. It is clear from the Bergeron data that single\nWDs populate the near-IR color-color diagram close to the locus of A\u2013G main sequence stars,\ncorresponding to the first cluster of points in our 2MASS color-color diagram. Unresolved\ndouble degenerate (WD + WD) binaries would, of course, also be located in this region\nand cannot be distinguished from single WDs in the color-color diagram. In comparison\nto the Bergeron sample, our data (limited to the sub-set with photometric uncertainties of\n\u03c3JHK < 0.1 mag) cover a somewhat larger range in color space. This is partially due to\nthe fact that the Bergeron sample was selected to include only cool (Teff . 12, 000 K) WDs\nwith known parallaxes, while our sample contains a significant number of hotter WDs. We\nperformed a literature search that yielded temperatures for 114 WDs in our low-uncertainty\nsub-set, 55 of which have Teff > 12, 000 K. Those hot WDs generally populate the blue (lower\nleft) corner of the color-color diagram around (and below) the locus of the main sequence\nA stars. Further differences between the color distributions of the two data sets are due to\nthe lack of an exact 1:1 match of the particular WDs contained in each sample (that is, due\nto individual color differences from one WD to another), combined with the uncertainties\n2\n\nDuring our study, we found that, in general, binaries with separations of d \u2264 2\u2032\u2032 are unresolved in the\n2MASS images, while those with separations of d \u2265 4\u2032\u2032 are resolved. We assessed known binaries with\nseparations of 2\u2032\u2032 < d < 4\u2032\u2032 on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nin the photometry. Even a relatively small uncertainty of . \u00b10.1 mag in each color allows\nfor a substantial shift in the placement of an individual object in the color-color diagram.\nThe 206 WDs with the smallest uncertainties in our data set (large filled circles in Figure 1)\nhave mean uncertainties of h\u03c3H\u2212Ks i = \u00b10.07 mag and h\u03c3J\u2212H i = \u00b10.06 mag, while those in\nthe Bergeron sample are on the order of \u00b10.07 mag in each color index.\nAs mentioned above, we identify the clustering around the M star fiducial track in Figure\n1 as unresolved binary systems containing a WD and a low mass main sequence companion.\nThe gap between the two data clusters in Figure 1 (coincident with the locus of K0\u2013K5 main\nsequence stars) can be attributed to several factors. As indicated by the Bergeron sample,\nwe do not expect single WDs in this color region. Consequently, only a binary consisting of\na WD and a K dwarf companion would be located in this area of the color-color diagram.\nSuch composite systems are difficult to identify since the K star overwhelms the combined\nspectrum at optical\u2013near-IR wavelengths. Furthermore, such systems are intrinsically rare\nsimply due to a mass function effect; that is, if the binaries formed from a random pairing\nof stars from the same initial mass function, then there are, in general, fewer K stars than\nM stars as potential companions. Assuming a standard initial mass function (Kroupa 2002),\nwe calculate 0.079 for the expected ratio of K0\u2013K5 to M0\u2013M5 stars. This can be compared\nto the number of objects in the color bins corresponding to those spectral types in our data\nsample, for which we derive a ratio of \u2248 0.07. However, we caution that the photometric\nuncertainties make it unclear whether some of the systems belong to the M or K spectral\ntype bins. A change in the spectral type classification of these systems could alter the value\nof this ratio, between extreme cases of \u2248 0.06\u20130.20.\nBased on a comparison with the location of single WDs in the color-color diagram (from\nFigure 2), we selected all objects with (J \u2212 H) > 0.4 mag as WD + low mass main sequence\nstar binary candidates. After eliminating objects with the highest photometric uncertainties\n(small unfilled circles), we find 95 such binary star candidates. Thirty-nine (41%) of these\ncandidates are already listed as binaries in MS99. However, the references to their binary\nstatus contained in MS99 reveal that four of these are wide (resolved) binaries, whereas our\n2MASS photometry suggests that the WD component may also be an unresolved WD +\nred dwarf3 pair. We were unable to locate published information about the separations of\nanother five of the known binaries. We also performed a literature search with SIMBAD for\neach of our candidates, which identified 13 additional known binaries that are not classified\nas such in MS99. Table 1 lists all of our candidates together with notes and references\nregarding their binary classification status. Altogether, approximately half (47 out of 95) of\n3\n\nThroughout this paper we will refer to both M and L type main sequence stars as \"red dwarfs.\"\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nour candidates are previously unknown to be binaries.\nBecause of the limited spatial resolution of 2MASS (2\u2032\u2032 pixel\u22121 ), we investigated whether\na chance superposition of a red field star could have produced a significant number of our\nbinary candidates. However, visual inspection of the optical (DSS) and IR images shows\nthat none of our candidates are located in crowded fields, so that the likelihood of a chance\nsuperposition is very small. There are 50 additional objects classified as binaries in MS99\nthat are detected in the 2MASS 2IDR, but were not selected by our color criterion as unresolved binary candidates. Forty-two of those are known to be resolved binaries, in which\nwe can separately detect the WD and red dwarf components. Four are unresolved double\ndegenerate (WD + WD) binaries, which are indistinguishable from single WDs in the colorcolor diagram. The remaining four are unresolved WD + main sequence binaries in which\nthe companion has spectral type earlier than K (hence, these systems are dominated by the\nbright companion and fall along the main sequence in the color-color diagram, intermingled\nwith the single WDs and below our color selection criterion). Thus, our 2MASS data allows\nus to recover all of the known, unresolved WD + red dwarf binaries from MS99 that are\ndetected in the 2MASS 2IDR.\n\n3.2.\n\nSimulated Binary Colors\n\nWhile the red colors of the low mass companions provide a striking contrast to those of\nthe WDs, the luminosity of the low mass stars also rapidly declines as the companion mass\ndecreases. In order to properly evaluate the relative contribution of the WD and the red\ncompanion to the overall color of a binary, we calculated the expected colors from random\npairings of a WD and a M\u2013L dwarf. We combined (as fluxes) the JHKs magnitudes of the\nsub-set of Bergeron WDs with known distances (and, hence, absolute magnitudes) with the\nabsolute JHKs magnitudes of M\u2013L stars (Hawley et al. 2002) to produce a set of simulated\nbinary colors. The resulting simulated binaries are shown as small grey circles in Figure 2.\nRecall that the large black circles in this figure represent the original single WD data from\nBergeron et al. (2001). The solid black line is a schematic track demonstrating the effect\non the combined color as a given WD is successively combined with later and later spectral\ntype stars. In general, after a short excursion into the region occupied by early-L dwarfs,\nthe red companion becomes too faint to dominate the combined colors of the system. For\nprogressively later L type companions, the binary color moves blueward, back towards the\nlocus of single WDs.\nIt is apparent from this simulation that some systems with colors close to those of single\nWDs may actually contain low mass L dwarf companions. Consequently, we selected a second\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\ngroup of WDs from our 2MASS data set that satisfy the color criteria 0.2 \u2264 (H \u2212 Ks ) \u2264 0.5\nand 0.1 \u2264 (J \u2212 H) \u2264 0.4. These 15 objects are listed as tentative binary candidates in Table\n2. Four of them are identified as known binaries by MS99. Interestingly, however, all of\nthese are classified as wide (resolved) binaries, which may imply that they are really triple\nsystems, in which the WD component is actually an unresolved WD + red dwarf binary\nas well. Another one of them (WD0710+741) is a known close (unresolved) binary. Marsh\n& Duck (1996) used radial velocity data to estimate the mass of the WD's companion as\n0.08\u20130.10M\u2299 , which is consistent with a late-M to early-L spectral type.\n\n3.3.\n\nComparison to Previous Studies\n\nPrevious dedicated searches for cool companions to WDs using near-IR observations\nhave been conducted by Probst (1983, henceforth, P83), Zuckerman & Becklin (1992), and\nGreen, Ali, & Napiwotzki (2000, henceforth, GAN00). P83 surveyed 113 relatively bright\nWDs in K with a 12\u2032\u2032 -aperture, single-pixel InSb detector. This survey was somewhat\nhampered by the lack of spatial resolution and because the majority of WDs were observed\nin only the K filter (only 28 of the P83 targets have measurements in all three bands, JHK).\nThe presence of IR excess (indicating a possible cool companion) was deduced by comparison\nof the observed K magnitude with that predicted by model calculations. Out of the 113\nobjects surveyed, only seven objects exhibited IR excess and could be readily deconvolved\ninto a WD + red dwarf pair. Six additional objects are identified as \"anomalous composites,\"\nwhich showed moderate IR excess but could not be separated into a WD + red dwarf pair\nvia model fits. Our Ks band measurements agree well with those of P83 for almost all of the\n49 targets in common between our studies. Four of the binary candidates identified by P83\nare located in the 2MASS 2IDR sky coverage. Three of these four (0034\u2212211, 0429+176,\nand 1333+487) are listed in MS99 as binaries and are also found as binary candidates in\nour 2MASS data. The fourth object, WD 1919+145, is listed in P83 as an \"anomalous\ncomposite\" with moderate IR excess; however, its 2MASS colors in our data place it in the\nlocus of single WDs.\nZuckerman & Becklin (1992) expanded the survey by P83 to include \u223c 200 WDs. They\nfound likely cool companions within 6\u2032\u2032 of 21 WDs. They do not provide their entire list\nof surveyed WDs (only the binary candidates), so we cannot perform a full comparison to\nour data. Eight of their binary candidates overlap with our 2MASS sample and six of these\n(0710+741, 0752\u2212146, 1026+002, 1123+189, 1210+464, and 2256+249) are also identified\nas binary candidates in our data. The remaining two are a resolved binary and an unresolved\ndouble degenerate.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nFinally, GAN00 obtained J and K band observations of 49 Extreme Ultraviolet Explorerselected hot WDs. Ten of these WDs exhibit significant IR excess, five of which were previously known to be WD + red dwarf binaries. Thirty-four of the 49 WDs from GAN00\nare located in the 2MASS 2IDR sky coverage, but six of these are too faint and were not\ndetected (another, WD0427+741J, was one of the ten found to have an IR excess, but it is\nnear the faint detection limit for 2MASS, lacks formal photometric uncertainties, and is not\nincluded in our list of binary candidates). Of the remaining 27 objects that were detected\nby 2MASS, three are known unresolved binaries listed in MS99 (0148\u2212255J, 1123+189 and\n1631+781), while two more were identifed as binaries in other literature sources (0131\u2212163\nand 1711+667J) \u2013 see Table 1. (These are the same five objects noted by GAN00 as previously known binaries.)\n\n4.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have shown that the near-IR color-color diagram is an effective means of identifying\ncandidate binary stars containing a WD and a low mass main sequence star. The loci of\nsingle WDs and WD + red dwarf binaries occupy distinct regions of the near-IR color-color\ndiagram. Using our data from the 2MASS 2IDR, we recovered all known unresolved WD +\nred dwarf binaries located in the 2IDR sky coverage, and also identified nearly as many new\ncandidate binaries (47 new candidates out of 95 total). In addition, a handful of the known\nresolved binaries may actually be triple systems, in which the WD component is itself an\nunresolved WD + red dwarf binary. We expect to be able to more than double again the\nnumber of candidate binaries using the forthcoming full sky data release from 2MASS.\nUsing observational near-IR data for WDs and M\u2013L dwarfs, we have compared a sample\nof simulated WD + red dwarf binaries with our 2MASS data. The colors of the simulated\nbinaries are dominated by the low mass companion through the late-M to early-L spectral\ntypes. As the spectral type of the companion becomes progressively later, however, the\ncolors of unresolved binaries become progressively bluer. Binaries containing the lowest\nmass companions will be difficult to distinguish from the locus of single WDs in the nearIR color-color diagram. We have identified an additional 15 WDs that may comprise such\nbinaries. It is encouraging that one of these has been found to be a close WD + red dwarf\nbinary in which the companion has a mass of . 0.1M\u2299 (Marsh & Duck 1996). In order\nto distinguish the WD + red dwarf binaries from single WDs for systems containing the\nlowest mass L dwarfs (and brown dwarfs), it is likely to be necessary to observe further\ninto the infrared; for example, at the mid-IR wavelengths observable with the Space Infrared\nTelescope Facility (e.g., Igance 2002).\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nWe thank Roc Cutri (for a helpful discussion about the 2MASS colors of main sequence\nstars), Gus Muench-Nasrallah (for sharing his insight into initial mass functions), and Vandana Desai and Oliver Fraser (who helped locate WDs in 2MASS images in exchange for\npizza).

Bragaglia et al.\n(1990) reclassified it as a WD + red dwarf binary, which is supported by its 2MASS colors.\nc\n\nWD0102+210.2 is classified as one component of a wide double degenerate binary (Sion\net al. 1991), but our 2MASS colors suggest that it may be a close WD + red dwarf binary\nalso.\nd\n\nWD0205+133 may be a sdOB + red dwarf binary, instead of a WD + red dwarf binary\n(Allard et al. 1994).\ne\n\nThis object is classified as the WD component of a wide (resolved) WD + red dwarf\nbinary, but our 2MASS colors suggest that the WD may also be a close WD + red dwarf\nbinary.\nf\n\nThe binary separation of WD0628\u2212020 (4\u2032\u2032 ) is near the 2MASS resolution limit; there is\nonly one entry in the 2IDR point source catalog, but these magnitudes may be for the red\ndwarf component only.\ng\nh\n\nThe companion of WD1517+502 is a dwarf carbon star (Liebert et al. 1994).\n\nWD1610+383 is barely resolved on the DSS images as a common proper motion pair with\nred and blue components at a separation of \u2248 4 arcsec. Blinking of the DSS and 2MASS\nimages suggests that only the red component is detected by 2MASS. Its near-IR colors are\nconsistent with an early-M spectral type.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\n\nTable 2.
