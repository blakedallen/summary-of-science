With these data\nwe are able to resolve the complex kinematical structure within star forming knots in Haro\n15 galaxy.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe aim of this work is to confirm the presence of GHiiRs in galaxies visible from the southern hemisphere and to perform a comparative study of GHiiRs with different metallicities\nand environments.This is performed determining the velocity dispersion which broadens the\nprofile of the emission lines. To study the correlation within the Luminosity versus Velocity Dispersion plane, we measure the velocity dispersion from high-resolution spectra as is\n\n\f2\n\nHaro 15 in detail\n\nthe echelle spectroscopy. And, using simple dispersion and echelle spectra, we are studying\nthe basic parameters of the regions, such as electronic temperature and density, chemical\nabundances and evolutionary states of the regions.\nUsing narrow-band CCD photometry, Feinstein [6] analyzed the brightness distribution\nin a sample of spiral galaxies visible in the southern sky. The most luminous HII regions of\nFeinstein's sample was our first candidates to study. In Firpo et al. [7] and Firpo et al. [8] we\nconfirmed the giant nature of nine candidates to giant HII regions. Continuing our detailed\nanalysis of GHIIRs in local universe galaxies, our sample now includes six spirals galaxies.\nFrom photometry of emission lines (Cair\u00f3s et al.[2], Gil de Paz et al.[9]), we have selected\nbright knots in low-metallicity galaxies, as blue compact dwarf galaxies (BCDs). The bright\nknots are the new candidates to study.\n\n2\n\nObservations and Reductions\n\nWe obtained high dispersion spectra in five knots of Haro 15 galaxy with an echelle spectrograph at the 100-inch du Pont Telescope, Las Campanas Observatory (LCO) between 19\nand 20, July 2006. Following the same nomenclature of Cair\u00f3s et al.[3] labelling the bright\ngalactic optical center as A, B is the bright region at the south-east of the galactic center, a\nweak region C in the north-east, and two new diffuse regions E at the north-northeast close\nto knot C, and region F at the south-west of the galactic center (E and F regions not are\nreferred by Cair\u00f3s et al. [3]). The spectral range covered was from 3400 to 10000\u00c5 with\n\u2206\u03bb=0.25\u00c5 at \u03bb 6000\u00c5, as measured from the FWHM of the ThAr comparison lines. This\ntranslates in a resolution of \u223c12 kms\u22121 (R'25000). We also obtained long-slit low resolution\nspectra using the Wide-Field CCD (WFCCD) camera at the same telescope (2005 September\n28) for two luminous knots in the BCD galaxy Haro 15. The TEK5 detector was used to\ncover the wavelength range 3800-9300\u00c5 (centered at \u03bbc 3800\u00c5) giving a spectral dispersion\nof 3.2\u00c5 px\u22121 (R' 800). Spectrophotometric standards, according to the respective observing\nmode, were also observed. We have obtained a good flux calibration for each group of data.\nThe data analysis was carried out with IRAF1 software. After bias subtraction and flat\nfield corrections with Milky Flats, the bidimensional images were corrected for cosmic rays\nand reduced with IRAF routines following similar procedures to those described in Firpo et\nal. [7].\n\n3\n\nThe nature of giant HII regions\n\nIn Firpo et al. [8] we observed a residual present in the wings of several lines when fitting single\nGaussian profiles to the emission lines. Basing on the variety studies that have been proposed\nin the literature to interpret the existence of the broad supersonic component measured in\nthe emission line profile of GHiiRs, and whenever possible, we have evaluated the possible\npresence of a broad component (Mu\u00f1oz-Tu\u00f1\u00f3n et al. [15], Melnick et al.[14], H\u00e4gele et al.[10],\n1\n\nImage Reduction and Analysis Facility, distributed by NOAO, operated by AURA, Inc., under agreement\nwith NSF.\n\n\fFirpo et al.\n\n3\n\nH\u03b2\n[OIII]5007\nH\u03b1\n[NII]6584\n[SII]6717\n\n-1\n\nerg s cm \u00c5 )\n\nHaro 15 A\n\nLog Flux (10\n\n-15\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n6200\n\n6400\n\n6600\n-1\n\nVelocity (km s )\n\nFigure 1: The agreement between fits to the most intense emission lines can be readily seen\nin the log(Flux) vs. Velocity plane.\n\nH\u00e4gele et al.[11], H\u00e4gele et al.[12], among others) or two symmetric low-intensity components\nin the fit with the observed emission line profile widths (Chu & Kennicutt [4], Rala\u00f1o et al.\n[16], Rozas et al. [17]).\nAs already reported in Firpo et al. [8], in the present work we have also found that\nall Haro 15 knots show evidence of wing broadening evident mainly in the H\u03b1 line and\nconfirmed in other emission lines. Making use of the iterative fitting of multiple Gaussian\nprofiles we evaluate the presence of a broad component and more than one narrow component\nin the emission line profileAnd, in this case, we have been able to fit a low amplitude broad\ncomponent to the integral profile wings for all regions.\nFigure 1 shows the good correlation of the fits between the emission line profiles in the\nLog Flux-Velocity plane for the most intense emission lines of Knot A.\n\n4\n\nRelation between H\u03b1 Luminosities and Velocity Dispersion\n\nThe distribution of the regions in the log(L)\u2212log(\u03c3) plane are strongly dependent on the components derived from the profile fitting (Firpo et al. [8]). Individual components have smaller\nfluxes and velocity dispersions than the global profile and points are therefore shifted in the\ndiagram. All of the observed knots, except knot F, show supersonic velocities (>13 km s\u22121 ).\nFigure 2 shows the L(H\u03b1) vs. \u03c3 relation for the individual knots of Haro 15 wich are identified from A to F letters. The plot includes results from individual components (black plus\npattern symbols with the error bars).

Luminosities and velocity dispersions are\nderived from our spectrophotometric data. The luminosities are not corrected for extinction.\n\nwhile subscript s refers to line widths measured by fitting a single Gaussian component to\nthe line. H\u03b1 luminosities were derived from the fluxes measured directly from the component\nfitting to our echelle spectra (uncorrected by reddening), and using distances as published\nby de Vaucouleurs et al. [5] for Haro 15. Data for NGC 6070 and NGC 7479 from Firpo et\nal. [8] (narrow, nA and nB where applicable, and single (g) components) are also plotted\nand identified by color solid error bars and with numbers (from 1 to 6): NGC 7479-I (1)\nin red, NGC 7479-II (2) in green, NGC 7479-III (3) in yellow, NGC 6070-I (4) in maroon,\nNGC 6070-II (5) in violet and NGC 6070-IV (6) in magenta). And a few Giant Hii regions\nfrom Bosch et al. [1] are plotted too (blue dashed error bars) together with their linear fit to\ntheir \"young\" Giant Hii regions as a reference value. Definitely, the presence of more than one\nGaussian component rules the final position of the Hii regions in the log(L) \u2212 log(\u03c3) plane.\nAt any case, it can be said that the single Gaussian component represents the upper limit\nfor the velocity dispersion. Characteristic broad components with large supersonic velocity\ndispersions and low intensities, should not contribute substantially to the total luminosity\nbut could contribute to the observed velocity dispersion.\n\n5\n\nPhysical properties in Haro 15 knots\n\nFrom long-slit and echelle spectroscopy, and based on the kinematic results, we study the\nphysical conditions (electron density and temperature), ionic and total chemical abundances\nof several atoms, reddening and ionization structure derived for each component.\n\n\fFirpo et al.\n\n5\n\nIt was only possible to derive the [Oiii] and [Siii] temperature for knot B, since we are\nable to measure the corresponding auroral lines only for this source. Temperatureas derived\nusing the direct method from the broad and narrow components are very similar, within the\nerrors.\nOxygen abundances and their uncertainties were derived for each observed knot using\nthe direct method, where possible, or several empirical methods using the strong emission\nlines present in the spectra. We notice a difference in the O/H ratio between knots A and\nB. This difference was suggested by L\u00f3pez-S\u00e1nchez & Esteban [13] as the two objects might\nhave had a different chemical evolution. Our results support these differences between the\ntwo regions. Knot C shows oxygen abundance similar to that of knot B within the errors,\nwhile the oxygen abundance derived for knot E is closer to the abundance calculated for knot\nA. The S/N in our knot F spectra is not as good as for the other knots, and the quantities\nderived for this region should be used with caution.\nThe ratio between O+ /O2+ and S+ /S2+ denoted by \u03b7 is intrinsically related to the shape\nof the ionizing continuum and depends on nebula geometry only slightly (V\u0131\u0301lchez & Pagel\n[18]). The purely observational counterpart, the \u03b7' diagram (\u03b7'=[([Oii]/[Oiii])/([Sii]/[Siii])),\nwhere \u03b7 and \u03b7' are related through the electron temperature but very weakly. The position\nof knot B in both diagrams shows a compatible ionization structure, lying in the highest\nexcitation region, similar to the ionization structure as Hii galaxies. The efective temperature\nof the radiation field (related to the slope of the line) derived for each component in knot B\nis practically the same.\n\n6\n\nIntegral Field Spectroscopy in Haro 15 knots\n\nThe net effect on the overall spectrum for each region is to increase the apparent width of\nthe line profile, which could lead to an overestimation of its velocity dispersion as well as a\nglobal and not discrete estimation of the physical condition and element abundances of the\ngas in those regions.\nKnots A and B show complex structure which is evident in radial velocity space, but\ncould not be spatially resolved. Recently in 2008, we have obtained high spatial resolution\nspectroscopy using the Integral Field Unit mode on the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph\ninstrument at the Gemini South telescope. The observations were done using the smaller\nfield of view (maximum wavelength coverage) combining the blue grating and the red grating\nto cover the blue-to-red end. This allowed us to obtain full coverage from [Oiii]\u03bb4363\u00c5 in\nthe blue to [Siii]\u03bb9532\u00c5 in the red. We obtained three observing positions, two are included\nto observe the regions that build knot A and a offset more is included to observe knot B.\nTo perform an in-depth 2D spectroscopic study, we have obtained the data cubes, and from\nthe preliminar results we are able to resolve the complex kinematical structure within star\nforming knots in Haro 15 galaxy.\n\n\f6\n\nHaro 15 in detail\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to the director and staff of LCO for technical assistance and warm hospitality.
