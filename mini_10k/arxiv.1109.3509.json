A commonly known origin of DWs is in the theory of media with a\nvectorial local order parameter, such as magnetics [1], ferroelectrics [2], and liquid crystals [3]. In systems described by\nbinary wave functions (at the fundamental or phenomenological level), the DW represents a transient layer between\nsemi-infinite domains carrying different components, or distinct combinations of the components.\nA simple but physically significant example is a rectilinear border between two regions occupied by spontaneously\nemerging roll structures with different orientations. This is, for instance, a generic defect observed in patterns on the\nsurface of thermal-convection layers [4\u20136]. The theoretical description of such patterns is based on systems of coupled\nGinzburg-Landau equations, each equation governing a slowly varying amplitude of a plane wave whose superposition\nforms the DW [7]. Formally similar systems of coupled nonlinear-Schr\u00f6dinger (NLS) equations and Gross-Pitaevskii\n(GP) equations describe, respectively, the co-propagation of electromagnetic waves with orthogonal polarizations\nin nonlinear optical fibers [8], and binary mixtures of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in cigar-shaped traps [9].\nWhile the Ginzburg-Landau systems are dissipative ones, on the contrary to the conservative NLS/GP systems, their\nstationary versions essentially coincide, hence DW patterns, generated by the stationary equations, are ubiquitous,\nplaying a fundamental role in sundry physical media, both dissipative and conservative ones. Of course, the dynamics\nof perturbed DW structures may be different in the dissipative and conservative systems.\nThe basic models which give rise to DWs formed by two fields feature nonlinear XPM (cross-phase-modulation)\ninteraction between the fields. In this context, one-dimensional (1D) solutions for DWs were reported in Ref. [7] for\ngrain boundaries in thermal-convection patterns, in Refs. [10, 11] for temporal-domain DWs between electromagnetic\nwaves with orthogonal circular polarizations in bimodal optical fibers, and (in a number of different forms) in twocomponent BECs [12]. Various extensions of these settings were investigated too, including grain boundaries between\ndomains filled by different cellular [13] and quasi-periodic [14] patterns, and between traveling-wave domains in the\nmodel of the oscillatory thermal convection [15]. Optical DWs between polarized waves with different wavelengths\nwere also studied [16]. Moreover, the analysis was performed for DW states in the discrete version of the nonlinearlycoupled NLS system, which describes arrays of parallel bimodal optical waveguides [17] or BEC fragmented in a\ndeep optical-lattice potential (in the latter case, the system takes the form of the Bose-Hubbard model) [18]. Also\nconsidered were the transition to immiscibility in binary BEC with long-range dipole-dipole interactions [19], and\nvarious forms of DWs in the three-component spinor BEC [20].\nAs concerns the experiment, linear grain boundaries between patches filled by rolls with different orientations had\nbeen well documented in many observations of the thermal convection [5, 21]. Similar linear defects were reported in\nlaser cavities [22] and in experimental studies of BEC [25]. Well-pronounced DW structures have also been created\nin bimodal optical fibers [23] and in fiber lasers [24].\nIn many physically relevant settings, the nonlinear interaction between coexisting waves competes with the linear\ninterconversion between them, which strongly affects the DW patterns in such binary systems. In particular, the linear\ncoupling between the orthogonal polarizations induced by the twist or elliptic deformation of the optical fiber gives\nrise to an effective force accelerating the corresponding DW [11]. The linear interconversion between two components\nof a binary BEC representing different atomic hyperfine states, coupled by a resonant radio-frequency wave, affects\nthe formation of the DW in immiscible binary condensates [26]. The objective of the present work is to develop a\ncomprehensive study of DW states in systems of NLS/GP equations coupled by both the linear and nonlinear (XPM)\nterms, in 1D and 2D geometries. Related two-component vortical states in 2D are studied too.\nThe paper is organized as follows. The model is formulated in Section II. In Section III, we consider flat continuouswave (CW) states, which represent backgrounds supporting DWs. Both symmetric and asymmetric CW states are\nfound, and the symmetry-breaking bifurcation (SBB), which gives rise to asymmetric CW backgrounds, is identified.\nThe stability of the flat states is also investigated in this section. Basic types of DWs in the free space (without\nan external potential) are considered in Section IV, where both analytical and numerical solutions for the DWs are\nreported, and the stability of the DW patterns is established. Section V deals with one and two DWs interacting with\nan external potential, in the form of one or two peaks. In particular, an analytical stable solution is produced for a\nDW pinned to a potential peak. Two-dimensional axisymmetric patterns are considered in Section VI. Stable vortices\nwith topological charges s = 1, 2, 3, supported by the asymmetric CW background, are found, and radial oscillations\nof annular pulsons in the form of circular DWs are studied too. The paper is concluded by Section VII.\n\n\f3\nII.\n\nTHE MODEL\n\nOur starting point is the system of scaled one-dimensional NLS/GP equations for two wave functions \u03c81,2 , coupled\nby the linear and nonlinear (XPM) terms:\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\ni (\u03c81 )t = \u2212 (1/2) (\u03c81 )xx + \u03c3 |\u03c81 | \u03c81 + g |\u03c82 | \u03c81 \u2212 \u03ba\u03c82 ,\n(1)\ni (\u03c82 )t = \u2212 (1/2) (\u03c82 )xx + \u03c3 |\u03c82 | \u03c82 + g |\u03c81 | \u03c82 \u2212 \u03ba\u03c81 ,\nwhere \u03ba is the rate of the linear interconversion between the two atomic states, if the system is interpreted in terms\nof BEC [26]. The same equations, with time t replaced by the propagation distance, z, and x replaced by the reduced\ntime, \u03c4 \u2261 t \u2212 z/Vgr , where Vgr is the group velocity of the carrier wave, may be realized in optics as the model of\nthe light propagation in an ordinary or photonic-crystal fiber [8]. In the fiber-optic model, amplitudes \u03c81,2 represent\ntwo mutually orthogonal polarizations of light, with the linear interconversion induced by the birefringence or twist\nof the fiber, for the circular or linear polarizations, respectively. Coefficients \u03c3 and g in Eqs. (1) account for the SPM\n(self-phase-modulation) and XPM nonlinearities, respectively (in the ordinary optical fiber, the XPM/SPM ratio is\ng/\u03c3 = 2 and 4/3 for the of circular and linear polarizations, respectively).\nTo secure the modulational stability of CW states supporting DWs, coefficient g will be kept positive, which\ncorresponds to the repulsive XPM nonlinearity, while SPM coefficient \u03c3 may have any sign. In optics, opposite signs\nof the XPM and SPM coefficients is an exotic situation, which is, nevertheless, possible in photonic-crystal fibers [8].\nIn BEC, the sign of either coefficient may be switched by means of the Feshbach-resonance effect [9].\nThe value of g may be fixed by dint of an obvious rescaling [for instance, it is possible to set g \u2261 3, which is a\nnatural choice in view of the existence of an exact DW solution in the form of Eqs. (36) and (37), see below, which\nrequires g = 3\u03c3]. In addition, the rescaling allows one to fix |\u03ba| \u2261 1, thus we will assume \u03ba = \u00b11. Nevertheless, in\nthe analytical expressions written below, we keep g and \u03ba as free parameters, as it is easier to analyze the results in\nsuch a form.\nStationary solutions to Eqs. (1) with chemical potential \u03bc are sought for as\n\u03c81,2 (x, t) = e\u2212i\u03bct \u03c61,2 (x),\n\n(2)\n\nwith real functions \u03c61,2 (x) satisfying equations\n\u03bc\u03c61 + (1/2) \u03c6001 \u2212 \u03c3\u03c631 \u2212 g\u03c622 \u03c61 + \u03ba\u03c62 = 0,\n(3)\n\u03bc\u03c62 +\n\n(1/2) \u03c6002\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c3\u03c632\n\n\u2212\n\ng\u03c621 \u03c62\n\n+ \u03ba\u03c61 = 0,\n\nwith the prime standing for d/dx.

Here we explicitly consider the MI of the symmetric CW, and, in particular, we\nwill find conditions providing for the stability of the symmetric state exactly at the SBB point. Examining this case\nsecures that the asymmetric CW states are not subject to the MI \u2013 at least, close enough to the bifurcation point.\nTo analyze the MI, we look for perturbed solutions to Eqs. (1) in the well-known general form, i.e., as\n\u03c81,2 (x, t) = [A0 + a1,2 (x, t)] exp [\u2212i\u03bct + i\u03c71,2 (x, t))] ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere amplitude A0 is the same as in Eq. (5), while a1,2 and \u03c71,2 are infinitesimal perturbations of the amplitudes and\nphases of the two components (this form of the solution implies the incorporation of the small complex perturbations\ninto the unperturbed CW state). Then, eigenmodes of the perturbations are sought for as\no\nn\n(0)\n(0)\n(15)\n{a1,2 (x, t), \u03c71,2 (x, t)} = a1,2 , \u03c71,2 exp (\u03b3t + ipx) ,\nwhere p is an arbitrary real wavenumber of the perturbation, and \u03b3 the corresponding instability gain, which may be\ncomplex. The stability condition is that Re{\u03b3(p)} \u2261 0 for all real p.\nThe substitution of expressions (14) and (15) into Eqs. (1) and linearization with respect to infinitesimal\npertur\u0010\n\u0011\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\nbations yields the following system of equations, which actually splits into two separate subsystems for a1 + a2\n\u0011\n\u0011 \u0010\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(0)\n(0)\n(0)\n(0)\n(0)\n(0)\n\u03c71 + \u03c72\nand a1 \u2212 a2 , \u03c71 \u2212 \u03c72 :\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(0)\n(0)\n(0)\n(0)\n\u03b3 a1 + a2 \u2212 (1/2) A0 p2 \u03c71 + \u03c72\n= 0,\n\n,\n\n(16)\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0002 2\n\u0003 \u0010 (0)\n(0)\n(0)\n(0)\n2A (g + \u03c3) + (1/2) p2 a1 + a2 + \u03b3A0 \u03c71 + \u03c72\n= 0;\n\n\f5\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u0002\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0003\n(0)\n(0)\n(0)\n(0)\n\u03b3 a1 \u2212 a2 \u2212 (1/2) p2 + 2\u03ba A0 \u03c71 \u2212 \u03c72\n= 0,\n(17)\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0002 2\n\u0003 \u0010 (0)\n(0)\n(0)\n(0)\n2A (g \u2212 \u03c3) \u2212 2\u03ba \u2212 (1/2) p2 a1 \u2212 a2 \u2212 \u03b3A0 \u03c71 \u2212 \u03c72\n= 0.\nThe resolvability conditions for Eqs. (16) and (17) yield, respectively, the following expressions for \u03b3(p):\n\u0002\n\u0003\n2\n\u03b3+\n= \u2212 (1/2) p2 2 (g + \u03c3) A20 + (1/2) p2 ,\n\u0001\u0002\n\u0003\n2\n\u03b3\u2212\n= 2\u03ba + (1/2) p2 2 (g \u2212 \u03c3) A20 \u2212 2\u03ba \u2212 (1/2) p2 .\nThe stability condition ensuing from Eq. (18), i.e.,\n\n2\n\u03b3+\n\n(18)\n(19)\n\n< 0, is obvious:\n\ng + \u03c3 > 0.\n\n(20)\n\nA20\n\nExpression (19) simplifies at the bifurcation point (10), where\n= \u03ba/ (g \u2212 \u03c3), as per Eq. (11):\n\u0002\n\u0003\n2\n\u03b3\u2212\n= \u2212 (1/2) p2 2\u03ba + (1/2) p2 .\n\n(21)\n\nEvidently, the stability condition following from Eq. (21) is \u03ba > 0, which, as a matter of fact, means that only the\nsymmetric flat solution may be stable at the SBB point, while its antisymmetric counterpart, that (as defined above)\ncorresponds to \u03ba < 0, is unstable. Further, from \u03ba > 0 and the positiveness of expression (11) for A2cr , condition\ng \u2212 \u03c3 > 0 follows. Combined with Eq. (20), it gives rise to the following relation between the XPM and SPM\ncoefficients necessary for the existence and stability of the asymmetric CW states:\n|\u03c3| < g,\n\n(22)\n\nwhile \u03c3 may be positive or negative. In fact, it will be demonstrated below that DW solutions do not exists for \u03c3 < 0.\nNote that condition (22) does not hold for g = 0, hence the DWs that can be found in the system with the solely\nlinear coupling are always unstable, as demonstrated in Ref. [27]. In that work, it was shown that the unstable DW\ngives rise to an expanding layer filled with turbulent waves.\nB.\n\nThe modulational stability of the asymmetric background\n\nIn the general case of the asymmetric CW background, the perturbed solution is taken as [cf. Eq. (14)]\n\u03c81,2 (x, t) = A1,2 [1 + b1,2 (x, t)] exp [\u2212i\u03bct + i\u03c71,2 (x, t))] ,\nwhere A1,2 are given by Eqs. (7), and infinitesimal perturbations are taken as [cf. Eqs.

It has been\nverified\nthat, with A1 and A2 taken as\n\b\n\u0001\nper Eqs. (7) and (8), and for all p2 \u2265 0, all the roots satisfy condition Re \u03b3 p2 = 0, if \u03ba is positive and inequality\n(22) holds. Thus, as long as the symmetric CW are stable at the SBB point, its asymmetric counterparts are stable\ntoo.\nIV.\n\nDOMAIN-WALL SOLUTIONS IN THE FREE SPACE\nA.\n\nNumerical results\n\nStationary solutions to equations (3) were constructed by means of the Newton-Raphson method for the corresponding nonlinear boundary-value problem. In particular, the boundary conditions were fixed as zero values of the\nderivatives at both edges of the integration domain.\nDWs are built as transient layers fusing together CW states of different types. Obviously, such patterns are possible\nat \u03bc2 > \u03bc2cr [see Eq. (10)], where asymmetric CW solutions exist, as given by Eqs. (7). Figure 1 shows that, in this\ncase, one can find four different types of the transient layers, if dark solitons are counted too. These types may be\nclassified by values of coupled fields (\u03c61 , \u03c62 ) in the uniform states connected by the DWs:\n{(\u03c61 (x = \u2212\u221e), \u03c62 (x = \u2212\u221e)) , (\u03c61 (x = +\u221e), \u03c62 (x = +\u221e))}\n= {(A1 , A2 ) , (A2 , A1 )} ; {(A1 , A2 ) , (\u2212A2 , \u2212A1 )} ;\n{(A1 , A2 ) , (\u2212A1 , \u2212A2 )} ; {(A0 , A0 ) , (\u2212A0 , \u2212A0 )}\n\n(27)\n\n[recall that A0 is given by Eq. (5), and A1,2 are given by Eqs. (7)]. In fact, only the patterns of the first and second\ntypes in Eq. (27) [Figs. 1(a) and (b)] are true DWs, while Figs. 1(c) and (d), corresponding to the profiles of the\nthird and fourth types in Eq. (27), are paired dark solitons. It is also clear that the dark-soliton pairs of the latter\ntype, displayed in Fig. 1(d), are unstable past the SBB point, as symmetric CW state (5) is unstable in this case.\nIt is relevant to mention that DWs connecting the symmetric and asymmetric states \u2013 for instance, (A1 , A2 ) and\n(A0 , A0 ) \u2013 are impossible, because a stationary DW may only exist between two asymptotic flat states with equal\nHamiltonian densities [11]. Comparing the respective densities (6) and (9), one can immediately conclude that they\ncoincide solely at the bifurcation point (10).\nTo investigate the stability of the DW patterns, small perturbations were added to the stationary solutions:\nf1 (x, t) = \u03c61 (x) + v1 (x)e\u2212i\u03b3t + u\u2217 (x)ei\u03b3 \u2217 t ,\n\u03c6\n1\n\u2217\n\u2212i\u03b3t\nf\n\u03c62 (x, t) = \u03c62 (x) + v2 (x)e\n+ u\u2217 (x)ei\u03b3 t ,\n2\n\n(28)\n\nwhere v1 , u1 and v2 , u2 constitute eigenmodes of the infinitesimal perturbation, and \u03b3 is the corresponding eigenfrequency that, in general, may be complex. Substituting expressions (28) into Eqs.

Accordingly, the solution is identified\nas a stable one if all the eigenfrequencies are real.\nThe stability analysis outlined above demonstrates that the DW family of the first type in Eq. (27), which is\nrepresented by Fig. 1(a), is completely stable (past the SBB point, where it exists, along with the asymmetric CW\nstates). In this case, all the other types of the DW and dark-soliton solutions [i.e., all of them which cross zero at least\nin one component, see Fig. 1(b,c,d)] are completely unstable, due to the presence of imaginary eigenfrequencies in the\nspectrum of small perturbations. We stress that, unlike the trivial background instability of the pattern of the last\ntype in Eq. (27), those of the second and third types, which are represented by Figs. 1(b) and (c), are destabilized by\nperturbations localized around the transient layer, while the CW background is stable. Direct simulations demonstrate\nthat these unstable DWs decay into expanding turbulent patterns (see Fig. 2). The stability of the DW of the first\ntype in Eq. (27) was also verified by direct simulations (not shown here).\n\n\f7\n\n1.5\n1\n1\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u03c61\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\u22121\n0\n\n\u221210\n\n0\n\n\u221210\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\nx\n\nx\n1.5\n1\n2\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u03c62\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\u22121\n0\n\n\u221210\n\n0\n\n\u221210\n\n10\n\n0\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n1\n1\n\n\u03c61\n\n1\n\n\u03c6\n\n0\n\n0\n\u22121\n\n\u22121\n\u221210\n\n0\n\n\u221210\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\nx\n\nx\n1\n2\n\n1\n\n\u03c62\n\n10\n\nx\n\nx\n\n\u03c6\n\n0\n\n0\n\u22121\n\n\u22121\n\u221210\n\n0\n\n\u221210\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\nx\n\nx\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nFIG. 1.

(a) Comparison between the analytical approximation given by Eq. (34), which is shown by dotted lines, and\nnumerically found profiles of the domain walls (solid lines), for g = 3, \u03c3 = 1, \u03ba = 1 (\u03bccr = 1) and \u03b4\u03bc = 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 2.

In fact, this particular exact stationary solution is similar to the one that was found, also\nin the exact form, for the stationary version of coupled Ginzburg-Landau equations (but without the linear coupling)\nin Ref. [7]. Note that relation g = 3\u03c3, which is necessary for the existence of the exact solution, complies with the\nCW-stability condition (22). In terms of this exact solution, \u03bc may be considered as a free parameter, i.e., we actually\nhave a one-parameter solution family, under constraint g = 3\u03c3. An example of the exact DW solution can be seen\nin Fig. 1(a), where the parameters were chosen to comply with the exact solution. Finally, the total local density of\nsolution (36) is\n\u03c621 (x) + \u03c622 (x) = 2\n\n\u0002\n\n\u0001\n\u0003\nU02 + U12 \u2212 U12 sech2 (\u03bbx) ,\n\n(38)\n\ncf. Eq. (35).\nIt may also be relevant to mention that, under condition g = 3\u03c3, Eqs. (3) has another formal DW-like solution,\ngiven by Eqs. (36) and (37) with tanh replaced by coth. However, this additional solution is singular, therefore it has\nno physical meaning.\n\nV.\n\nDOMAIN WALLS IN THE PRESENCE OF EXTERNAL POTENTIALS\n\nThe model based on Eqs. (3) can be naturally extended to include an external potential, W (x):\n\u03bc\u03c61 + (1/2) \u03c6001 \u2212 \u03c3\u03c631 \u2212 g\u03c622 \u03c61 + \u03ba\u03c62 \u2212 W (x)\u03c61 = 0,\n(39)\n\u03bc\u03c62 + (1/2) \u03c6002 \u2212 \u03c3\u03c632 \u2212 g\u03c621 \u03c62 + \u03ba\u03c61 \u2212 W (x)\u03c62 = 0.\nIn this section we report the analysis performed for the DW patterns supported by this setting, with W (x) representing\nsingle- or double-peak potentials, with the intention to predict pinning of the DWs by such potentials. Stable pinning\nby potential maxima (rather than minima) may be possible because the DW's core features a minimum of the total\ndensity, see Eqs. (35) and (38), hence the total energy of the system may be minimized by placing the core around a\nlocal maximum of the potential.\n\n\f10\nA.\n\nThe exact solution in the presence of a single-peak potential\n\nIt is possible to find an exact solution to Eqs. (39) for the DW if the potential is chosen as\nW (x) = W0 sech2 (\u03bbx)\n\n(40)\n\nwhere W0 and \u03bb are considered as given parameters. The corresponding solution can be looked for in the form of the\nsame ansatz (36) as used for finding the exact solution in the free-space setting. The substitution of the ansatz into\nEqs. (39) demonstrates that it yields an exact solution in the present case under the following condition imposed on\nparameters of the system:\ng=\n\n3\u03bb2 + 2W0\n\u03c3,\n\u03bb2 + 2W0\n\n(41)\n\nwhich goes over into the above relation, g = 3\u03c3, in the limit of W0 = 0. Further, coefficients U0 , U1 , and \u03bc of the\nexact solution are given by the following expressions:\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03bc = \u03bb\u22122 \u03bb2 + 2W0 \u03bb2 + \u03ba ,\n\u0001\u22121 2\n\u0001\n\u0001\nU02 = 4\u03c3\u03bb2\n\u03bb + 2W0 \u03bb2 + 2\u03ba ,\n(42)\n\u0001\n\u22121\n2\n2\nU1 = (4\u03c3)\n\u03bb + 2W0 .\nIt is easy to see that, in the limit of W0 = 0, Eqs. (42) carry over into the above exact solution, given by Eqs. (37).\nThus, this exact solution is an extension of the previous one, although it has no free parameters [note that \u03bb, which\nwas an adjustable parameter of the free-space solution, is now fixed by the given form of potential (40)].\nAs argued above, the present exact solution is expected to be stable if W (x) represents a repulsive potential barrier\n(peak), with W0 > 0, and the solution should be unstable, against spontaneous escape from the pinned state, in the\ncase of the attractive potential well, with W0 < 0 [cf. Eq. (48) below]. In turn, Eq. (41) with W0 > 0 gives g < 3\u03c3.\nNote also that, unlike its counterpart in the free space, this exact solution may exist at \u03c3 < 0: In the case of the\npotential well (W0 < 0), with \u03bb2 < \u22122W0 < 3\u03bb2 , Eq. (41) yields \u03c3 < 0. However, this solution should be unstable\naccording to the above argument.\nB.\n\nAnalysis of the interaction between DWs and the interaction of the DW with the external potential\n\nThe interaction of the DW with an external potential can be investigated in an approximate form. In fact, a similar\nproblem which also admits an approximate analytical treatment is the interaction between two broadly separated\nDWs with opposite polarities (i.e., mirror images of each other) in the free space, therefore we start with this case.\nAssuming that the two DWs are set at distance L which is large in comparison with the inner width of each DW,\nthe interaction between them can be analyzed by means of the method elaborated in Ref. [28]. To this end, the\napproximate expression for the nearly flat fields in the region between the far separated solitons is taken as\n\u03c6n (x) = An + 2Un [exp (\u22122\u03bb |x \u2212 \u03be1 |) + exp (\u22122\u03bb |x \u2212 \u03be2 |)] ,\n\n(43)\n\nwhere n = 1, 2, and A1,2 are given by Eqs. (7), \u03be1,2 are coordinates of the centers of the two DWs, so that L \u2261 \u03be2 \u2212 \u03be1 ,\nand the exponential terms represent small decaying tails of the DWs on top of the flat background. The decay rate\n\u03bb > 0 can be found in the general case, but the expression for it is cumbersome; amplitude U1,2 are not known in an\nexact form in the general case, as they may only be found from full solutions for individual DWs. In the special case\nof the exact solution given by Eqs. (36), at g = 3\u03c3), coefficients \u03bb and U1,2 in Eq. (43) are actually given by Eq. (37):\np\n\u221a\n(44)\n\u03bb = \u03bc \u2212 \u03ba, U1 = U2 = (1/2) (\u03bc \u2212 \u03ba) /\u03c3.\nThen, using Hamiltonian produced by density (4) and the method developed in Ref. [28] (identifying the term accounting for the interaction energy in the expression for the full Hamiltonian), the effective potential of the interaction\nbetween the two separated DWs is found in the following form:\n\u0001\nUint (L) = \u22128\u03bb U12 + U22 exp (\u22122\u03bbL) .\n(45)\nIn the case of the exact DW solution given by Eqs. (36) and (37), this expression takes an explicit form,\n\u0001\n\u221a\n3/2\nUint (L) = \u22124 (\u03bc \u2212 \u03ba) exp \u22122 \u03bc \u2212 \u03baL .\n\n(46)\n\n\f11\nA simple but essential property of expressions (45) and (46) is that they obviously predict attraction between the two\nDWs.\nWith the external potential W (x) included into Eqs. (39), Hamiltonian density (4) is modified as\ni \u03c3\n\u0001\n1h 0 2\n2\n(\u03c61 ) + (\u03c602 ) +\n\u03c641 + \u03c642\n2\n2\n\u0001\n+g\u03c621 \u03c622 \u2212 2\u03ba\u03c61 \u03c62 + 2W (x) \u03c621 + \u03c622 \u2212 A21 \u2212 A22 ,\nH=\n\n(47)\n\nwhere constants A21,2 are subtracted from \u03c621,2 (x) for convenience (to cancel a formally diverging constant term in the\nHamiltonian), A1,2 being the same as in Eqs. (7). This means that the energy of the interaction of the DW with the\nexternal potential is\nZ +\u221e\n\u0002\n\u0003\nUpot = 2\nW (x) \u03c621 (x) + \u03c622 (x) \u2212 A21 \u2212 A22 dx.\n(48)\n\u2212\u221e\n\nAssuming that W (x) represents a broad potential barrier or well with a width much larger than the thickness of\nthe DW, and treating the external potential as a perturbation (i.e., neglecting the distortion of the solution under the\naction of the potential), the substitution of the exact DW solution given by Eqs. (36) and (37) into Eq. (48) readily\nyields:\n\u221a\n(49)\nUpot (\u03be) \u2248 \u22128U12 \u03bb\u22121 W (\u03be) \u2261 \u22122 \u03bc \u2212 \u03ba\u03c3 \u22121 W (\u03be) ,\nwhere \u03be is the coordinate of the center of the DW. A straightforward consequence of Eq. (49) is that, as conjectured\nabove, the DW tends to be trapped at local maxima of the external potential W (x), as, due to sign minus in Eq.\n(49), they correspond to minima of the effective potential (49).\nIf two DWs are trapped at two particular maxima of W (x), \u03be1 and \u03be2 , separated by large distance L, the equilibrium\ncondition for each DW is the vanishing of the total force produced by the interaction of the DW with its counterpart\nand with the external potential:\n\u0014 \u221a\n\u0015\n\u0001\n\u221a\n\u2202 2 \u03bc\u2212\u03ba\n3/2\nW (\u03be1 ) + 4 (\u03bc \u2212 \u03ba) exp \u22122 \u03bc \u2212 \u03ba (\u03be2 \u2212 \u03be1 )\n\u2202\u03be1\n\u03c3\n\u0015\n\u0014 \u221a\n\u0001\n\u221a\n\u2202 2 \u03bc\u2212\u03ba\n3/2\n(50)\n=\nW (\u03be2 ) + 4 (\u03bc \u2212 \u03ba) exp \u22122 \u03bc \u2212 \u03ba (\u03be2 \u2212 \u03be1 ) = 0.\n\u2202\u03be2\n\u03c3\nFor example, if the potential is periodic, W (x) = \u000f cos (2\u03c0x/\u039b), with large period \u039b, one may consider the pair of\nDWs trapped at two adjacent potential maxima. Substituting this potential into Eqs. (50), it is easy to check that its\nminimum strength, necessary for holding the DW pair (i.e., preventing it from merger due to the mutual attraction)\n\u221a\n3/2\nis \u000fmin = (2/\u03c0) \u03c3\u039b (\u03bc \u2212 \u03ba) exp (\u2212 \u03bc \u2212 \u03ba\u039b) .\nC.\n\nNumerical results for the model with an external potential\n\nThe above analysis predicted that two DWs created in the free space attract each other. Direct simulations confirm\nthe prediction, see a typical example in Fig. 4. Eventually, the two DWs annihilate into the stable uniform asymmetric\nstate. Naturally, for larger initial values of the separation between the DWs, the attraction force is weaker, and a\nconsiderably longer time is required for the DW pair to manifest the interaction.\nIn the presence of the external potential in Eqs. (39), the numerical investigation was carried out for two different\nshapes of W (x). First, the single potential barrier was considered, taken in the same form (40) which was used to\nobtain the exact solution. The corresponding stationary DW solutions are similar to their counterparts found in the\nfree space. Specifically, out of the four types of the DWs categorized by the values of (\u03c61 (x), \u03c62 (x)) at x = \u00b1\u221e as per\nEq. (27), only the first one is stable, see a typical example in Fig. 5(a). In addition to the DWs, the potential barrier\nsupports states in the form of \"bubbles\" (defined as per Ref. [29]), i.e., patterns with identical values of (\u03c61 (x), \u03c62 (x))\nat x = \u00b1\u221e, and localized perturbations of \u03c61,2 (x) around the barrier, see Figs. 5(b)\u2013(c). Naturally, the bubbles\nsupported by the asymmetric and symmetric CWs are stable and unstable, respectively.\nThe expectation that the DW is stably trapped by the potential peak is confirmed by direct simulations displayed\nin Fig. 6(a), for the DW of the first type, in terms of Eq. (27), i.e. {(A1 A2 ), (A2 A1 )} [it is the same DW which is\ndisplayed in Fig. 5(a)]. The DW, if shifted from the potential maximum by \u2206x = 5, performs decaying oscillations\naround the peak. The decay of the oscillations is explained by emission of radiation waves into the background by\nthe oscillating DW.\n\n\f12\n\nFIG. 4.

Typical profiles of the domain-wall (a) and \"bubble\" (b,c) stationary solutions found in the presence of the potential\npeak (40), for g = 8/3, \u03c3 = 1, \u03ba = 1, \u03bb = 1, W0 = 0.1, and \u03bc = 2.4 [these values of the parameters admit the existence of the\nexact DW solution (41)-(42), which is actually displayed in (a)]. The stable and unstable solutions are depicted by continuous\nand dashed curves, respectively.\n\nThe attraction of DWs to the potential peak is further illustrated by Fig. 5(b), which displays a pair of identical\nDWs symmetrically placed, at t = 0, at distances \u2206x = \u00b15 from the peak. Due to the attraction of both DWs to the\npeak, in this case their annihilation happens much sooner than for the same pair in the free space, cf. Fig. 4 for the\nsame value of separation 2\u2206x between the DWs.\nThe numerical analysis was also carried out for the double-peak potential, taken in the form of\n\u0010\n\u0011\n2\n2\nW (x) = W0 (2x/L) exp 1 \u2212 (2x/L) ,\n(51)\nwhere W0 is the height of the two peaks and L is the distance between them. The numerical solution of Eqs. (39)\nwith potential (51) has revealed multiple structures, which may be considered as transient layers between CW states\nfilling the three regions separated by the two potential barriers. These structures can be categorized into two groups,\nbuilt of symmetric or asymmetric CWs. The structures of the former type are arranged as the following sets of the\nCW states in the three regions [cf. Eq. (27)]:\n{(A0 , A0 ) , (A0 , A0 ) , (A0 , A0 )} ; {(A0 , A0 ) , (A0 , A0 ) , (\u2212A0 , \u2212A0 )} ;\n{(A0 , A0 ) , (\u2212A0 , \u2212A0 ) , (A0 , A0 )} .\n\n(52)\n\nThese three varieties may be interpreted, respectively, as containing none, one, or two dark solitons trapped in each\ncomponent.\n\n\f13\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 6.

(b) Similar to panel (a), but for the pair of DWs, placed symmetrically on both sides of the potential\nmaximum, at x = \u00b15.\n\nUsing various combinations of the asymmetric CW states, we have built the following patterns supported by the\ndouble-peak potential, cf. Eqs. (27) and (52):\n{(A1 , A2 ) , (A1 , A2 ) , (A1 , A2 )} ; {(A1 , A2 ) , (A1 , A2 ) , (A2 , A1 )} ;\n{(A1 , A2 ) , (A2 , A1 ) , (A1 , A2 )} ;\n\n(53)\n\n{(A1 , A2 ) , (A1 , A2 ) , (\u2212A1 , \u2212A2 )} ; {(A1 , A2 ) , (\u2212A1 , \u2212A2 ) , (A1 , A2 )} ;\n{(A1 , A2 ) , (A1 , A2 ) , (\u2212A2 , \u2212A1 )} ; {(\u2212A1 , \u2212A2 ) , (A1 , A2 ) , (A2 , A1 )} ;\n{(A1 , A2 ) , (\u2212A1 , \u2212A2 ) , (A2 , A1 )} ; {(A1 , A2 ) , (A2 , A1 ) , (\u2212A1 , \u2212A2 )} ;\n{(A1 , A2 ) , (\u2212A2 , \u2212A1 ) , (A1 , A2 )} .\n\n(54)\n\nThe three patterns (53) feature, respectively, none, one, or two trapped DWs, while seven patterns (54) include dark\nsolitons or zero-crossing (sign-changing) DWs. As before, those patterns which do not cross zero in any component\nare stable [in the case of the first pattern in (52), this is, naturally, true prior to the SBB], while all the solutions\nfeaturing at least one zero crossing are unstable. Examples of the patterns of these types are presented in Fig. 7, for\nW0 = 0.1 and L = 10.\nThe attractive interaction of the DWs with the potential peaks is additionally illustrated by simulations displayed\nin Fig. 8. In particular, if a single DW is initially placed at the midpoint between the peaks, the evolution of this\nobviously unstable configuration leads to damped oscillations of the DW around either peak to which it is pulled,\nsee Fig. 8(a). On the other hand, symmetrically placing pairs of identical DWs either between (Fig. 8(b)) or outside\n(Fig. 8(c)) of the potential peaks, we observe coherent oscillations with the apparently unbroken symmetry. In the\nlatter case, the symmetric oscillations feature very slow damping, which is explained by the small value of W0 = 0.1 in\nthis case. Similar simulations for larger W0 demonstrate oscillations which converge much faster to a stable symmetric\nconfiguration, with each DW trapped by one potential peak.\n\n\f1.5\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u03c61\n\n14\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n\u221210\n\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n\u221210\n\n0\n\n10\n\nx\n1.5\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u03c62\n\nx\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n\u221210\n\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n\u221210\n\n0\n\nx\n\nx\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n10\n\n1\n\n1.35\n1.3\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u03c61\n\n0.9\n\n\u221210\n\n0\n\n0.85\n0.8\n\n10\n\n\u221210\n\nx\n\n10\n\n2\n\n0.9\n\n0.35\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u03c62\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0\n\nx\n\n\u221210\n\n0\n\nx\n(c)\n\n10\n\n0.85\n0.8\n\n\u221210\n\n0\n\n10\n\nx\n(d)\n\nFIG. 7.

(55) admit the straightforward interpretation as the GP equations for the two-component\ncondensate in a 2D pancake-shaped configuration. In terms of optics, these equations, with t replaced by propagation\ncoordinate z, govern the transmission of a stationary beam through the bulk nonlinear medium, with functions\n\u03c81,2 representing two circular polarizations. In the latter case, the linear mixing between the polarizations can be\ninduced by the linear birefringence, which, in turn, may be imposed by mechanical stress applied perpendicular to\nthe propagation axis [8], or, alternatively, by dc magnetic field applied in the same direction [30] (the birefringence\nimposed by the transverse magnetic field leads to the classical Cotton-Mouton/Voigt effects [31]).\nGeneral axisymmetric solutions to Eqs. (55) are looked for in the form of the optical vortices (alias 2D dark solitons)\n[8, 32], which also correspond to the vortex modes in BEC [9]:\n\u03c81,2 (x, y, t) = \u03c61,2 (r, t) exp(is\u03b8) exp(\u2212i\u03bct),\n\n(56)\n\nwhere r and \u03b8 are the polar coordinates in the (x, y) plane, and integer s is the topological charge (vorticity, alias\n\"spin\").\n\n\f15\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\n(c)\n\nFIG. 8.

(5)\nand (7). In particular, the bifurcation described by Eqs. (10) and (11) is relevant in the 2D case too.\nThe study of the existence, stability and dynamics of 2D axisymmetric patterns, generated by Eqs. (57), is presented\nbelow in two steps. First, stationary vortices, supported by the asymmetric CW background, are obtained for spins\ns = 0, 1, 2 and 3, and their stability is determined. Then, the evolution of the pulsons, i.e., circular DWs oscillating in\nthe radial direction, is investigated by means of direct simulations. In this connection, it is relevant to mention that\npatterns in the form of circular DWs are well known in various magnetic media [33]\nA.\n\nStationary vortices\n\nTo find stationary solutions of Eqs. (57), we proceed to the time-independent version of these equations and apply\nthe Newton-Raphson method to the respective nonlinear boundary-value problem. The boundary conditions demand\nthat \u03c61,2 (r) \u2192 rs at r \u2192 0, while, at r \u2192 \u221e, \u03c61,2 (r) asymptotically approach the symmetric or asymmetric CW\nsolutions, (5) or (7). Examples of the radial profiles of such modes are displayed in Fig. 9. For the s = 0, no stationary\nsolutions exist, apart from the obvious flat states (which are not shown in Fig. 9). For each non-zero value of the\nspin that was examined, s = 1, 2 and 3, two families of nontrivial stationary solutions were obtained, supported [past\nbifurcation point (10)] by the symmetric and asymmetric CW states at r \u2192 \u221e, hence they demonstrate precisely the\nsame existence and bifurcation features as the corresponding flat states, (5) and (7).\n\n\f16\n\n1.4\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\ns=2\n\n1.2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n\u03c61, \u03c62\n\n1\n\n\u03c61, \u03c62\n\n\u03c61, \u03c62\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\ns=1\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\u221220\n\n\u221210\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n0\n\u221220\n\n\u221210\n\n0\n\nr\n\n10\n\n20\n\ns=3\n\n0\n\u221220\n\n\u221210\n\nr\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\nr\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFIG. 9. (a,b,c): Radial profiles of the symmetric and asymmetric stationary vortices, with spin s = 1, 2, and 3, respectively\n(no non-flat stationary 2D solutions were found for s = 0). The parameters are g = 3, \u03c3 = 1, \u03ba = 1, and \u03bc = 2. Solid and\ndashed curves depict, respectively, two components of the stable asymmetric solutions, and unstable symmetric ones.\n\nTo explore the stability of the 2D stationary solutions, we seek for perturbed solutions as [cf. Eqs. (28)]\nf1 (r, \u03b8, t) = U (r) + [U+ (r) exp(in\u03b8) + U\u2212 (r) exp(\u2212in\u03b8)] exp(\u03b3n t),\n\u03c6\nf2 (r, \u03b8, t) = V (r) + [V+ (r) exp(in\u03b8) + V\u2212 (r) exp(\u2212in\u03b8)] exp(\u03b3n t),\n\u03c6\n\n(58)\n\nwhere integer n > 0 is an arbitrary azimuthal index of the perturbation, and \u03b3n is the corresponding instability growth\nrate.

We treat Eqs. (59) as an algebraic eigenvalue problem for \u03b3n and solve it directly,\nusing a finite-difference method. The largest instability-growth rate is identified as the real part of the most unstable\neigenvalue, max{Re(\u03b3n )}. Following this approach, we have confirmed that the only source of the destabilization is\nthe transition between the symmetric and asymmetric modes, which, as said above, is actually driven by the SBB\nin the flat background at r \u2192 \u221e. In particular, no azimuthal instability, that would break the axial symmetry,\nwas found for s = 1, 2, 3, for all integer values of n considered. The absence of the azimuthal instability in the case\nof the self-defocusing nonlinearity is actually a natural feature [34]. In addition, this finding implies that the flat\n(quasi-one-dimensional) DW is stable against corrugations in the 2D setting.\n\nB.\n\nDirect simulations \u2013 shrinking domain walls and pulsons\n\nAnother aspect of the 2D model based on equations (55) was examined by investigating the development of circular\nDWs into pulsons, i.e., annular grain boundaries periodically shrinking and expanding in the radial directions. It is\nknown that, while exact solutions for such pulsons do not exist, in some models, such as the 2D single-component\nsine-Gordon equation, the pulsons may be remarkably stable, featuring hundreds [35, 37] and thousands [36] of radial\npulsations with very little loss.\n\n\f17\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFIG. 10. The initial evolution of the pulsons (circular domain walls) for s = 0 (a), s = 1 (b), and s = 2 (c). The initial radius\nof the circular DW is R0 = 20, the other parameters being g = 3, \u03c3 = 1, \u03ba = 1 and \u03bc = 2.\n\nWe have performed simulations of pulsating radial DWs for three values of the spin, s = 0, 1 and 2. The simulations were implemented by means of the linearized Crank-Nicolson scheme. As initial conditions, the following DW\nconfiguration, based on the asymmetric uniform states (7), was used,\n\u03c61 (r, t = 0) = (1/2) tanhs (r) {A1 [1 + tanh(r \u2212 R0 )] + A2 [1 \u2212 tanh(r \u2212 R0 )]} ,\n\u03c62 (r, t = 0) = (1/2) tanhs (r) {A1 [1 \u2212 tanh(r \u2212 R0 )] + A2 [1 + tanh(r \u2212 R0 )]} ,\n\n(60)\n\nwhere R0 is the initial radius of the DW. Note that this initial ansatz complies with the necessary boundary condition\nat r \u2192 0, \u03c61,2 (r) \u223c rs . The boundary conditions at the right edge of the integration interval, 0 < r < \u03c1, were\nadopted as (\u2202\u03c61,2 /\u2202r + \u2202\u03c61,2 /\u2202t) |r=\u03c1 = 0. These conditions prevent the reflection of the emitted radiation from the\nboundary.\nFor each value of the spin considered here, s = 0, 1, 2, the simulations were run for several values of the initial\nradius, R0 . Typical examples of the initial stage of the observed evolution are demonstrated in Fig. 10, for R0 = 20\nand for the parameters g = 3, \u03c3 = 1, \u03ba = 1 and \u03bc = 2. Similar results were obtained for other values of R0 .\nIt was observed that, while the pulsons shrink and expand in a quasi-periodic manner, their smallest and largest\nradii, Rmin and Rmax , do not remain constant, slowly decreasing from a cycle to a cycle, as shown in Fig. 11. In\nparticular, the decay of Rmax is roughly exponential in time, with some irregularities observed at t ' 400 and at the\nfinal stage of the evolution. The decay is plausibly caused by the emission of radiation waves by the pulsating DW.\nAlso decreasing is the oscillation period, \u03c4l , taken as the time interval between two consecutive points at which the\npulson expands to the largest radius, \u03c4l = t(r = Rmax,l ) \u2212 t(r = Rmax,l\u22121 ), where l is the number of the cycle. The\nrelation between the slowly decreasing period and the effective maximum radius, Rmax ,eff \u2261 (Rmax,l + Rmax,l\u22121 )/2,\nis presented in Fig. 12. The plots demonstrate a nearly linear dependence for all s. The same linear dependence was\nobtained for different values of the initial radius, including R0 = 10, 15, 30, and 40.\nThe linear relation between \u03c4l and Rmax can be easily explained. Indeed, considering a large-radius circular DW,\nwith radius R much larger than the thickness of the DW in the radial direction, one can define the effective mass for\nthe radial pulsations, M = 2\u03c0Rm, and the effective surface-tension energy, EST = 2\u03c0R\u03b1, where m and \u03b1 are the\n\n\f18\n\ns=0\ns=1\ns=2\n\n800\n700\n600\n\nt\n\n500\n400\n300\n\nRmin\n\n200\n\nRmax\n\n100\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nRmax, min\n\nFIG. 11.

This result explains the linear\nproportionality of \u03c4l to Rmax .\nFinally, Fig. 13 displays the final stage of the evolution, observed when the pulson's radius and oscillation period\nhave been sufficiently reduced. In this case, the oscillatory behavior fades out and the pulsons transform into the\nstable asymmetric stationary states which are presented above in subsection VI A (in particular, they are flat for\ns = 0, and feature the vortex shape for s = 1 and 2). For the case considered above (with R0 = 20), the transition to\nthe eventual stationary state occurs at t \u2248 830, for all the values of the spin.\n\n\f19\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFIG. 13. (Color online) The final stage of the evolution of the pulsons with s = 0, 1 and 2, whose initial evolution was displayed\nin Fig. 10. The pulsons with s = 1 and 2 transform into the asymmetric stationary (stable) modes shown in Fig. 9.\n\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe objective of this work was to investigate fundamental DW (domain-wall) modes in the system of nonlinearSchr\u00f6dinger/Gross-Pitaevskii equations, coupled by the linear and XPM (cross-phase-modulation) terms. The system\nof coupled equations has natural realizations in two-component Bose-Einstein condensate, and in nonlinear optics,\nwhere the two wave functions represent amplitudes of co-propagating signals with orthogonal polarizations. First,\nconditions providing for the stability of the uniform CW (continuous wave) symmetric and asymmetric bimodal states,\nwhich support the DW patterns, were identified, and then the general families of DW solutions were constructed in\nthe 1D setting. In particular, approximate analytical solutions were found near the symmetry-breaking bifurcation\npoint of the CW states, and an exact solution was found for the XPM/SPM ratio 3 : 1. The DW states connecting\nasymptotically flat asymmetric states which are mirror images to each other (without the change of the overall sign)\nare stable, while all other types of the DWs, which feature zero crossings (including dark solitons), are unstable.\nInteractions between two DWs with opposite polarities were also considered. The potential of the attraction between\nthem was found in the analytical form, and numerical simulations have demonstrated that the attraction leads to\nannihilation of the DW pair.\nDWs trapped by the single or double potential peaks were investigated too. An exact solution for the DW trapped\nby a single peak was found. In the general case, it was predicted and corroborated by direct simulations that the\nbound state of the DW placed at a maximum of the external potential is stable. The interaction of two DWs in the\npresence of the single- and double-peak potentials was also studied.\nThe analysis was extended to axisymmetric patterns in the 2D geometry, including vortices carrying the topological\ncharge s = 1, 2, 3 and supported by the asymmetric flat background at infinity. Stable stationary states for the\nvorticity-carrying DW rings were found. The stability of the vortices against azimuthal perturbations was verified\nthrough the computation of the corresponding eigenvalues. Oscillations of annular DW-shaped pulsons were studied\nby means of systematic simulations (the linear relation between the period of the radial oscillations and largest radius\nof the annular DW was obtained in an analytical form). The evolution of the pulsons ends up with their relaxation\n\n\f20\ninto the stationary 2D modes (vortices, for s 6= 0, or simply the flat asymmetric state in the case of s = 0).\nThis work may be extended by a more systematic investigation of the 2D system, without assuming the axial\nsymmetry of the patterns. In particular, oscillations of eccentricity in elliptically deformed pulsons may be interesting\nto study, cf. Ref. [37]. In 1D, it may be also interesting to study in detail the behavior of DWs against the backdrop\nof periodic potentials (optical lattices), as well as in nonstationary systems with time-dependent parameters.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\n\nThe work of J.Z. was supported, in a part, by a postdoctoral fellowship provided by the Tel Aviv University, and\nby grant No. 149/2006 from the German-Israel Foundation.\n\n[1] V.
