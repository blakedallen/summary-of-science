For N \u2265 2 the broadcasting can be achieved perfectly,\nand for sufficiently noisy input states one can even purify the state while broadcasting-the socalled superbroadcasting. For purification (i.e. M \u2264 N ), the reduction of noise is independent\nof M . Similar results are proved for broadcasting with phase-conjugation. All the optimal\nmaps can be implemented by linear optics and linear amplification.\n\nThe impossibility of exact quantum cloning, namely copying the unknown state of a quantum system to a larger number of copies [1], has stimulated the search for quantum devices that\ncan emulate cloning with the highest possible fidelity. After the simplest case of qubits [2\u20134]\nmany optimal cloners have been found, for general finite-dimensional systems [5], restricted\nsets of input states [6,7], and infinite-dimensional systems such as harmonic oscillators-the so\ncalled continuous variables cloners [8]. However, when considering mixed states, a less stringent type of cloning transformation can be used-so-called broadcasting-in which the output\ncopies are in a globally correlated state whose local reduced states are identical to the input\nstates. This issue has been considered in Ref. [9], where it has been shown that broadcasting\na single copy from a noncommuting set of density matrices is always impossible. Later, this\nresult has been considered in the literature as the generalization of the no-cloning theorem to\nmixed states. However, more recently, for qubits an effect called superbroadcasting [10] has\nbeen discovered, which consists in the possibility of broadcasting the state while even increasing the purity of the local state, for at least N \u2265 4 input copies, and for sufficiently short\ninput Bloch vector (and even for N = 3 input copies for phase-covariant instead of universal\ncovariant broadcasting [11]).\n\u2020\nIn the present Letter, we study the broadcasting of conjugate quantum variables xa = a+a\n2\n\u2020\n\u2020\nand ya = a\u2212a\n2i , where a and a are the customary annihilation and creation operators for the\nharmonic oscillator (or single-mode radiation field), i.e. [a, a\u2020 ] = 1. We look for the map that\nfrom N uncorrelated states with the same complex amplitude provides M > N states, while\npreserving the amplitude and optimally reducing the total noise in conjugate quadratures.\nWe derive a bound from the quantum limits on noise in linear amplifiers that can be easily\nachieved experimentally. We will show indeed that such a bound cannot be overcome even for\nc EDP Sciences\n\n\f2\n\nEUROPHYSICS LETTERS\n\ngeneral nonlinear transformations (i.e. allowing for arbitrary quantum operations). Explicit\nexamples will be given for displaced thermal states, which are equivalent to coherent states\nthat have suffered Gaussian noise.\nAs we will see, superbroadcasting is possible for continuous variables for N \u2265 2, namely\none can produce a larger number M of purified copies at the output, locally on each use,\nand with the same amplitude of the input copies N . For displaced thermal states, e.g., N\nM\u2212N\nto M superbroadcasting can be achieved for input thermal photon number nin > M(N\n\u22121) .\nFor purification (i.e. M \u2264 N ), quite surprisingly the purification rate is nout /nin = N \u22121 ,\nindependently of M . We mention that the particular case of 2 \u2192 1 purification for noisy\ncoherent states has been reported in Ref. [12]. We will also consider the optimal broadcasting\nwith phase-conjugate output, showing analogous effects.\nFrom N uncorrelated modes a0 , a1 , ..., aN \u22121 with\nhai i = \u03b1 ,\n\n\u2206x2ai + \u2206ya2i = \u03b3i ,\n\n(1)\n\na broadcasting transformation provides M > N (generally correlated) modes b0 , b1 , ..., bM\u22121 ,\nwith the same complex amplitude and noise \u0393, i.e.\nhbi i = \u03b1 ,\n\n\u2206x2bi + \u2206yb2i = \u0393 ,\n\n(2)\n\nand we are looking for the minimal \u0393. This can be obtained by applying a fundamental\ntheorem for linear amplifiers: the sum of the uncertainties of conjugate quadratures of an\namplified mode with (power) gain G is bounded as follows [14]\n2\n2\n\u2206XB\n+ \u2206YB2 \u2265 G(\u2206XA\n+ \u2206YA2 ) +\n\n|G \u2213 1|\n,\n2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the upper (lower) sign holds for phase-preserving (phase-conjugating) amplifiers, and\nA and B denote the input and the amplified mode, respectively. In fact,\nour transformation\nPN \u22121\ncan be seen as a phase-preserving amplification from mode A = \u221a1N i=0 ai to mode B =\nPM\u22121\nM\n\u221a1\ni=0 bi with gain G = N , and hence Eq. (3) should hold. Notice that generally for any\nM\nmode c one has\n\u2206x2c + \u2206yc2 =\n\n1\n+ hc\u2020 ci \u2212 |hci|2 .\n2\n\n(4)\n\nIn the present case, since modes ai are uncorrelated, from Eqs. (1) and (4) we have hA\u2020 Ai =\nP \u22121\n\u03b3 + N |\u03b1|2 \u2212 12 , with \u03b3 = N1 N\ni=0 \u03b3i , whereas from Eqs.

The bound (8) is independent of the\nnumber of output copies, and corresponds to (6) for broadcasting in the limit M \u2192 \u221e.\nThe bound (6) for broadcasting can be achieved by the following experimental setup. By\nmeans of a N -splitter the signal is concentrated in one mode, whereas the other N \u2212 1 modes\nare discarded. The mode is then amplified by a phase-insensitive amplifier with power gain\nG= M\nN . Finally, the amplified mode is mixed in a M -splitter with M \u2212 1 vacuum modes. In\nthe concentration stage the N modes with \u221a\namplitude hai = \u03b1 and noise \u2206x2 + \u2206y 2 = \u03b3i are\nreduced to a single mode\nwith\namplitude\nN \u03b1 and noise \u03b3. The amplification stage gives\n\u221a\nM\n1\nthe distribution stage\na mode with amplitude M \u03b1 and noise \u03b3 \u2032 = \u03b3 M\nN + 2N \u2212 2 . Finally,\n\u0001\n1\nM\u22121\n\u2032\ngives M modes, with amplitude \u03b1 and noise \u0393 = M \u03b3 + 2\neach. We notice that the\nlinear amplifier can be replaced by a beam-splitter, heterodyne detection and feed-forward, as\nin Ref. [15].\nM\u2212N\nThe condition for superbroadcasting is given by \u0393 < \u03b3, namely \u03b3 \u2212 21 \u2265 M(N\n\u22121) , which\ncan be true for any N > 1, and up to M \u2264 \u221e. Consider, for example, the case of N displaced\nthermal states D(\u03b1)\u03c1n\u0304 D\u2020 (\u03b1) where\n1\n\u03c1n\u0304 =\nn\u0304 + 1\n\n\u0012\n\nn\u0304\nn\u0304 + 1\n\n\u0013a\u2020 a\n\n,\n\n(9)\n\nand n\u0304 denotes the thermal photon number. The output state is given by D(\u03b1)\u2297M \u03bbD\u2020 (\u03b1)\u2297M ,\nwith\nZ\n|\u03b3|2\nM d2 \u03b3\n\u2297M \u2212 Mn\u0304\n\u2032\n|\u03b3ih\u03b3|\ne\n\u03bb=\n,\n(10)\n\u03c0n\u0304\u2032\nwhere n\u0304\u2032 = M(n\u0304+1)\n\u2212 1. Such a state is permutation-invariant and separable, with displaced\nN\nthermal state at each use, with thermal photon number\nn\u0304\u2032\u2032 =\n\nn\u0304\u2032\nn\u0304\nM \u2212N\n=\n+\n.\nM\nN\nMN\n\n(11)\n\nThe superbroadcasting condition (output purity higher than the input one), is equivalent to\nM\u2212N\nrequire smaller thermal photon number at the output than at the input, namely n\u0304 \u2265 M(N\n\u22121) .\n1\n1\n\u2032\u2032\nIn fact, \u03b3 = n\u0304 + 2 and \u0393 = n\u0304 + 2 . Notice that for n\u0304 = 0 one has N coherent states at the\ninput, and n\u0304\u2032\u2032 = M\u2212N\nMN , namely one finds the optimal cloning for coherent states of Ref. [13].\nIn Fig. 1 we sketch the scheme for optimal 2 to 3 broadcasting. The superbroadcasting effect\narises for n\u0304 > 31 .\nFor achieving the optimal purification for any M \u2264 N , one simply uses an N -splitter which\nconcentrates the signal in one mode and discards the other N \u2212 1 modes. Then by N -splitting\nwith N \u2212 1 vacuum modes, one obtains N purified signals (although correlated), with equality\nin Eq. (7).\nThe bound for phase-conjugating broadcasting and purification (8) can be obtained by\nN -splitting, heterodyne measurement on one of the modes, and preparation of M coherent\n\u03b1\u2217\no\nstates with amplitude \u03b1 = \u221aN\n, where \u03b1o denotes the outcome of the measurement.\n\n\f4\n\nEUROPHYSICS LETTERS\n\nFig. 1 \u2013 Experimental scheme for optimal superbroadcasting from 2 to 3 copies. The schemes makes\nuse of a beam splitter, a phase-insensitive amplifier and a tritter (i.e. two suitably balanced beam\nsplitters). The output copies carry the same signal as the input, and are locally less noisy, the noise\nbeing confined into the correlations between them.\n\nWe would like to stress that the bounds (6), (7), and (8) hold for any state and relies\non the theorem of the added noise in linear amplifiers, namely only linear transformations of\nmodes are considered. Hence, in principle, these bounds might be violated when considering\na restricted set of states and allowing for more exotic and nonlinear transformations.\nIn the following we give a rigorous proof that these bounds indeed cannot be overcome\nby any quantum transformation. Let us consider a generic state \u039e\u03b1 of N uncorrelated modes\nwith noise \u03b3i , and hai i = \u03b1 for all modes. Then, \u039e\u03b1 can be written as D(\u03b1)\u2297N \u039e0 D\u2020 (\u03b1)\u2297N ,\n\u22121\nwhere D(\u03b1) = exp(\u03b1a\u2020 \u2212 \u03b1\u2217 a) denotes the displacement operator and \u039e0 = \u2297N\ni=0 \u03bei is the\ntensor product of N states, each with zero amplitude (i.e., for a single-mode radiation field,\nzero average value of the field) and noise \u03b3i . We look for a broadcasting map B that preserves\nthe unknown amplitude on each copy\nTr[bi B(D(\u03b1)\u2297N \u039e0 D\u2020 (\u03b1)\u2297N ] = \u03b1 ,\n\n(12)\n\nfor all i \u2208 [0, M \u2212 1] and complex \u03b1, such that each copy has minimal noise \u0393, where, using\nEq. (4)\n\u0393=\n\n1\n+ Tr[b\u2020i bi B(D(\u03b1)\u2297N \u039e0 D\u2020 (\u03b1)\u2297N )] \u2212 |\u03b1|2 .\n2\n\n(13)\n\nThe optimal broadcasting map can be searched among covariant maps B that satisfy for all\n\u03c3 and \u03b1 [16]\nB(D(\u03b1)\u2297N \u03c3D\u2020 (\u03b1)\u2297N ) = D(\u03b1)\u2297M B(\u03c3)D\u2020 (\u03b1)\u2297M .\nIt is useful to consider the Choi-Jamiolkowski bijective correspondence of completely positive\n(CP) maps B from Hin to Hout and positive operators RB acting on Hout \u2297 Hin , which is\ngiven by the following relations\nRB = B \u2297 I (|\u03a9ih\u03a9|) ,\nB(\u03c1) = Trin [(Iout \u2297 \u03c1\u03c4 )RB ] ,\n\n(14)\n\n\fG.

For N \u2265 2, the superbroadcasting\ncan be achieved, namely M > N copies can be obtained along with a reduction of noise\nin conjugate variables. Since the noise cannot be removed without violating the quantum\ndata processing theorem, the price to pay for having higher purity at the output is that the\ncopies are correlated. Essentially noise is moved from local states to their correlations, and\n\n\fG. M. D'Ariano, P. Perinotti, M. F.

All the optimal maps\ncan be easily implemented by linear optics and linear amplification (or beam-splitting and\nfeed-forward). Superbroadcasting is relevant for foundations, opening new perspectives in the\nunderstanding of correlations and their interplay with noise, and may be also promising from\na practical point of view, for communication tasks in the presence of noise.\n\u2217\u2217\u2217\nThis work has been supported by Ministero Italiano dell'Universit\u00e0 e della Ricerca (MIUR)\nthrough FIRB (bando 2001) and PRIN 2005.\nREFERENCES\n[1] W.
