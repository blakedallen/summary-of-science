We then provide, for the propositional fragment,\na sound and complete axiomatization that faithfully lifts Levesque's proof theory to the many agent\ncase. We also discuss comparisons to the earlier approach by Halpern and Lakemeyer.\n\n\f1 Introduction\nLevesque's notion of only-knowing is a single agent monotonic logic that was proposed with the intention of capturing certain types of nonmonotonic reasoning. Levesque ([1990]) already showed\nthat there is a close connection to Moore's ([1985]) autoepistemic logic (AEL). Recently, Lakemeyer\nand Levesque ([2005]) showed that only-knowing can be adapted to capture default logic as well.\nThe main benefit of using Levesque's logic is that, via simple semantic arguments, nonmonotonic\nconclusions can be reached without the use of meta-logical notions such as fixpoints [Rosati 2000;\nLevesque & Lakemeyer 2001] . Only-knowing is then naturally of interest in a many agent context,\nsince agents capable of non-trivial nonmonotonic behavior should believe other agents to also be equipped\nwith nonmonotonic mechanisms. For instance, if all that Bob knows is that Tweety is a bird and a default\nthat birds typically fly, then Alice, if she knows all that Bob knows, concludes that Bob believes Tweety\ncan fly.1 Also, the idea of only-knowing a collection of sentences is useful for modeling the beliefs of a\nknowledge base (KB), since sentences that are not logically entailed by the KB are taken to be precisely\nthose not believed. If many agents are involved, and suppose Alice has some beliefs on Bob's KB, then\nshe could capitalize on Bob's knowledge to collaborate on tasks, or plan a strategy against him.\nAs a logic, Levesque's construction is unique in the sense that in addition to a classical epistemic\noperator for belief, he introduces a modality to denote what is at most known. This new modality\nhas a subtle relationship to the belief operator that makes extensions to a many agent case non-trivial.\nMost extensions so far make use of arbitrary Kripke structures, that already unwittingly discard the\nsimplicity of Levesque's semantics. They also have some undesirable properties, perhaps invoking\nsome caution in their usage. For instance, in a canonical model (Lakemeyer 1993), certain types of\nepistemic states cannot be constructed. In another Kripke approach (Halpern 1993), the modalities do\nnot seem to interact in an intuitive manner. Although an approach by Halpern and Lakemeyer ([2001])\ndoes indeed successfully model multi-agent only-knowing, it forces us to have the semantic notion\nof validity directly in the language and has proof-theoretic constructs in the semantics via maximally\nconsistent sets. Precisely for this reason, that proposal is not natural, and it is matched with a proof\ntheory that has a set of new axioms to deal with these new notions. It is also not clear how one can\nextend their semantics to the first-order case. Lastly, an approach by Waaler ([2004]) avoids such an\naxiomatization of validity, but the model theory also has problems [Waaler & Solhaug 2005]. Technical\ndiscussions on their semantics are deferred to later.\nThe goal of this paper is to show that there is indeed a natural semantics for multi-agent onlyknowing for the quantified language with equality. For the propositional subset, there is also a sound\nand complete axiomatization that faithfully generalizes Levesque's proof theory.2 We also differ from\nHalpern and Lakemeyer in that we do not enrich the language any more than necessary (modal operators\nfor each agent), and we do not make use of canonical Kripke models. And while canonical models, in\ngeneral, are only workable semantically and can not be used in practice, our proposal has a computational appeal to it. We also show that if we do enrich the language with a modal operator for validity,\nbut only to establish a common language with [Halpern & Lakemeyer 2001], then we agree on the set of\nvalid sentences. Finally, we obtain a first-order multi-agent generalization of AEL, defined solely using\nnotions of classical logical entailment and theoremhood.\n1\n\nWe use the terms \"knowledge\" and \"belief\" interchangeably in the paper.\nThe proof theory for a quantified language is well known to be incomplete for the single agent case. It is also known that\nany complete axiomatization cannot be recursive [Halpern & Lakemeyer 1995; Levesque & Lakemeyer 2001].\n2\n\n1\n\n\fThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. We review Levesque's notions,3 and define a semantics with so-called k-structures. We then compare the framework to earlier attempts. Following\nthat, we introduce a sound and complete axiomatization for the propositional fragment. In the last sections, we sketch the multi-agent (first-order) generalization of AEL, and prove that k-structures and\n[Halpern & Lakemeyer 2001] agree on valid sentences, for an enriched language. Then, we conclude\nand end.\n\n2 The k-structures Approach\nThe non-modal part of Levesque's logic4 ON L consists of standard first-order logic with = and a countably infinite set of standard names N .5 To keep matters simple, function symbols are not considered in\nthis language. We call a predicate other than =, applied to first-order variables or standard names, an\natomic formula. We write \u03b1xn to mean that the variable x is substituted in \u03b1 by a standard name. If all\nthe variables in a formula \u03b1 are substituted by standard names, then we call it a ground formula. Here,\na world is simply a set of ground atoms, and the semantics is defined over the set of all possible worlds\nW. The standard names are thus rigid designators, and denote precisely the same entities in all worlds.\nON L also has two modal operators: L and N . While L\u03b1 is to be read as \"at least \u03b1 is known\", N \u03b1\nis to be read as \"at most \u00ac\u03b1 is known\". A set of possible worlds is referred to as the agent's epistemic\nstate e. Defining a model to be the pair (e, w) for w \u2208 W, components of ON L's meaning of truth are:\n1. e, w |= p iff p \u2208 w and p is a ground atom,\n2. e, w |= (m = n) iff m and n are identical standard names,\n3. e, w |= \u00ac\u03b1 iff e, w 6|= \u03b1,\n4. e, w |= \u03b1 \u2228 \u03b2 iff e, w |= \u03b1 or e, w |= \u03b2,\n5. e, w |= \u2200x. \u03b1 iff e, w |= \u03b1xn for all standard names n,\n6. e, w |= L\u03b1 iff for all w\u2032 \u2208 e, e, w\u2032 |= \u03b1, and\n7. e, w |= N \u03b1 iff for all w\u2032 6\u2208 e, e, w\u2032 |= \u03b1.\nThe main idea is that \u03b1 is (at least) believed iff it is true at all worlds considered possible, while (at\nmost) \u03b1 is believed to be false iff it is true at all worlds considered impossible. So, an agent is said to\nonly-know \u03b1, syntactically expressed as L\u03b1 \u2227 N \u00ac\u03b1, when worlds in e are precisely those where \u03b1 is\ntrue. Halpern and Lakemeyer ([2001]) underline three features of the semantical framework of ON L,\nthe intuitions of which we desire to maintain in the many agent setting:\n1. Evaluating N \u03b1 does not affect the epistemic possibilities. Formally, in ON L, after evaluating\nformulas of the form N \u03b1 the agent's epistemic state is still given by e.\n3\nThere are other notions of \"all I know\", which will not be discussed here [Halpern & Moses 1985;\nBen-David & Gafni 1989]. Also see [Rosati 2000].\n4\nWe name the logic following [Halpern & Lakemeyer 2001] for ease of comparisons later on. It is referred to as OL in\n[Halpern & Lakemeyer 1995; Levesque & Lakemeyer 2001].\n5\nMore precisely, we have logical connectives \u2228, \u2200 and \u00ac. Other connectives are taken for their usual syntactic abbreviations.\n\n2\n\n\f2. A union of the agent's possibilities, that evaluate L, and the impossible worlds that evaluate N ,\nis fixed and independent of e, and is the set of all conceivable states. Formally, in ON L, L\u03b1 is\nevaluated wrt. worlds w \u2208 e, and N \u03b1 is evaluated wrt. worlds w \u2208 W \u2212 e; the union of which is\nW. The intuition is that the exact complement of an agent's possibilities is used in evaluating N .\n3. Given any set of possibilities, there is always a model where precisely this set is the epistemic\nstate. Formally, in ON L, any subset of W can be defined as the epistemic state.\nAlthough these notions seem clear enough in the single agent case, generalizing them to the many agent\ncase is non-trivial [Halpern & Lakemeyer 2001]. We shall return to analyze the features shortly. Let\nus begin by extending the language. Let ON Ln be a first-order modal language that enriches the nonmodal subset of ON L with modal operators Li and Ni for i = a, b. For ease of exposition, we only\nhave two agents a (Alice) and b (Bob). Extensions to more agents is straightforward. We freely use Oi ,\nsuch that Oi \u03b1 is an abbreviation for Li \u03b1 \u2227 Ni \u00ac\u03b1, and is read as \"all that i knows is \u03b1\". Objective and\nsubjective formulas are understood as follows.\nDefinition 2.1: The i-depth of a formula \u03b1, denoted |\u03b1|i , is defined inductively as (\u0003i denotes Li or\nNi ):\n1. |\u03b1|i = 1 for atoms,\n2. |\u00ac\u03b1|i = |\u03b1|i ,\n3. |\u2200x. \u03b1|i = |\u03b1|i ,\n4. |\u03b1 \u2228 \u03b2|i = max(|\u03b1|i , |\u03b2|i ),\n5. |\u0003i \u03b1|i = |\u03b1|i ,\n6. |\u0003j \u03b1|i = |\u03b1|j + 1, for j 6= i\nA formula has a depth k if max(a-depth,b-depth) = k. A formula is called i-objective if all epistemic\noperators which do not occur within the scope of another epistemic operator are of the form \u0003j for\ni 6= j. A formula is called i-subjective if every atom is in the scope of an epistemic operator and all\nepistemic operators which do not occur within the scope of another epistemic operator are of the form\n\u0003i .\nFor example, a formula of the form La Lb La p \u2228 Lb q has a depth of 4, a a-depth of 3 and a b-depth\nof 4. Lb q is both b-subjective and a-objective. A formula is called objective if it does not mention any\nmodal operators. A formula is called basic if it does not mention any Ni for i = a, b. We now define\na notion of epistemic states using k-structures. The main intuition is that we keep separate the worlds\nAlice believes from the worlds she considers Bob to believe, to depth k.\nDefinition 2.2: A k-structure (k \u2265 1), say ek , for an agent is defined inductively as:\n\u2212 e1 \u2286 W \u00d7 {{}},\n\u2212 ek \u2286 W \u00d7 Ek\u22121 , where Em is the set of all m-structures.\n3\n\n\fA e1 for Alice, denoted as e1a , is intended to represent a set of worlds {hw, {}i, . . .}. A e2 is of the form\n{hw, e1b i, hw\u2032 , e\u2032 1b i, . . .}, and it is to be read as \"at w, she believes Bob considers worlds from e1b possible\nbut at w\u2032 , she believes Bob to consider worlds from e\u2032 1b possible\". This conveys the idea that Alice has\nonly partial information about Bob, and so at different worlds, her beliefs about what Bob knows differ.\nWe define a ek for Alice, a ej for Bob and a world w \u2208 W as a (k, j)-model (eka , ejb , w). Only sentences\nof a maximal a-depth of k, and a maximal b-depth of j are interpreted wrt. a (k, j)-model. The complete\nsemantic definition is:\n1. eka , ejb , w |= p iff p \u2208 w and p is a ground atom,\n2. eka , ejb , w |= (m = n) iff m, n \u2208 N and are identical,\n3. eka , ejb , w |= \u00ac\u03b1 iff eka , ejb , w 6|= \u03b1,\n4. eka , ejb , w |= \u03b1 \u2228 \u03b2 iff eka , ejb , w |= \u03b1 or eka , ejb , w |= \u03b2,\n5. eka , ejb , w |= \u2200x. \u03b1 iff eka , ejb , w |= \u03b1xn for all n \u2208 N ,\n6. eka , ejb , w |= La \u03b1 iff for all hw\u2032 , ebk\u22121 i \u2208 eka ,\neka , ebk\u22121 , w\u2032 |= \u03b1,\n7. eka , ejb , w |= Na \u03b1 iff for all hw\u2032 , ebk\u22121 i 6\u2208 eka ,\neka , ebk\u22121 , w\u2032 |= \u03b1\nAnd since Oa \u03b1 syntactically denotes La \u03b1 \u2227 Na \u00ac\u03b1, it follows from the semantics that\n8. eka , ejb , w |= Oa \u03b1 iff for all worlds w\u2032 , for all ek\u22121 for Bob, hw\u2032 , ebk\u22121 i \u2208 eka iff eka , ebk\u22121 , w\u2032 |= \u03b1\n(The semantics for Lb \u03b1 and Nb \u03b1 are given analogously.) A formula \u03b1 (of a-depth of k and of b-depth\nof j) is satisfiable iff there is a (k, j)-model such that eka , ejb , w |= \u03b1. The formula is valid (|= \u03b1) iff\n\u03b1 is true at all (k, j)-models. Satisfiability is extended to a set of formulas \u03a3 (of maximal a, b-depth\nof k, j) in the manner that there is a (k, j)-model eka , ejb , w such that eka , ejb , w |= \u03b1\u2032 for every \u03b1\u2032 \u2208 \u03a3.\nWe write \u03a3 |= \u03b1 to mean that for every (k, j)-model eka , ejb , w, if eka , ejb , w |= \u03b1\u2032 for all \u03b1\u2032 \u2208 \u03a3, then\neka , ejb , w |= \u03b1.\nValidity is not affected if models of a depth greater than that needed are used. This is to say, if \u03b1\nis true wrt. all (k, j)-models, then \u03b1 is true wrt. all (k\u2032 , j \u2032 )-models for k\u2032 \u2265 k, j \u2032 \u2265 j. We obtain this\n\u2032\n\u2032\nresult by constructing for every eka , a k-structure ea \u2193kk , such that they agree on all formulas of maximal\n\u2032\na-depth k.

By construction, we also have ea \u2193k1 , {}, w |= La \u03b1. Lastly, since La \u03b1 is\n\u2032\n\u2032\na-subjective, b's structure is irrelevant, and thus, ea \u2193k1 , eb \u2193j2 , w |= La \u03b1.\n\u2032\n\nFor the reverse direction, suppose ea \u2193k1 , eb \u2193j2 , w |= La \u03b1.

Since b's\n\u2032\n\u2032\nstructure is irrelevant, we have eka , ejb , w |= La \u03b1.

For item 3, wlog let \u0003i be La . Suppose eka , ejb , w |= \u00acLa\u03b1. There is\nsome hw\u2032 , ebk\u22121 i \u2208 eka such that eka , ebk\u22121 , w\u2032 |= \u00ac\u03b1. Let w\u2032\u2032 be any world such that hw\u2032\u2032 , e\u2032 bk\u22121 i \u2208 eka .\nThen, eka , e\u2032 bk\u22121 , w\u2032\u2032 |= \u00acLa \u03b1. Thus, eka , ejb , w |= La \u00acLa \u03b1. The case of Na is analogous.\nBefore moving on, let us briefly reflect on the fact that k-structures have finite depth. So suppose a\nonly-knows KB, of depth k. Using k-structures allows us to reason about what is believed, up to depth\nk. Also, if we construct epistemic states from k\u2032 -structures where k\u2032 \u2265 k, then the logic correctly captures non-beliefs beyond the depth k. To illustrate, let true (depth 1) be all that a knows. Then, it can\neasily be shown that both the sentences Oa (true) \u2283 \u00acLa \u00acLb \u03b1 and Oa (true) \u2283 \u00acLa Lb \u03b1 are valid\nsentences in the logic, by considering any e2 (and higher) for a. For most purposes, this restriction of\nhaving a parameter k seems harmless in the sense that agents usually have a finite knowledge base with\n5\n\n\fsentences of some maximal depth k and they should not be able to conclude anything about what is\nknown at depths higher than k, with one exception. If we were to include a notion of common knowledge [Fagin, Halpern, Moses & Vardi 1995], then we would get entailments about what is believed at\narbitrary depths. With our current model, this cannot be captured, but we are willing to pay that price\nbecause in return we get, for the first time, a very simple possible-world style account of only-knowing.\nSimilarly, we have nothing to say about (infinite) knowledge bases with unbounded depth.\n\n3 Multi-Agent Only-Knowing\nIn this section, we return to the features of only-knowing discussed earlier and verify that the new\nsemantics reasonably extends them to the multi-agent case. We also briefly discuss earlier attempts at\ncapturing these features. Halpern ([1993]), Lakemeyer ([1993]), and Halpern and Lakemeyer ([2001])\nindependently attempted to extend ON L to the many agent case.6 There are some subtle differences\nin their approaches, but the main restriction is they only allow a propositional language. Henceforth,\nto make the comparison feasible, we shall also speak of the propositional subset of ON Ln with the\nunderstanding that the semantical framework is now defined for propositions (from an infinite set \u03a6)\nrather than ground atoms.\nThe main component in these features is the notion of possibility. In the single agent case, each\nworld represents a possibility. Thus, from a logical viewpoint, a possibility is simply the set of objective\nformulas true at some world. Further, the set of epistemic possibilities is given by {{objective formulas true at w} |\nw \u2208 e}. Halpern and Lakemeyer ([2001]) correctly argue that the appropriate generalization of the notion of possibility in the many agent case are i-objective formulas. Intuitively, a possible state of affairs\naccording to a include the state of the world (objective formulas), as well as what b is taken to believe.\nThe earlier attempts by Halpern and Lakemeyer use Kripke structures with accessibility relations Ki for\neach agent i. Given a Kripke structure M , the notion of possibility is defined as the set of i-objective formulas true at some Kripke world, and the set of epistemic possibilities is obtained from the i-objective\nformulas true at all i-accessible worlds. Formally, the set of epistemic possibilities true at (M, w), where\n+\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nw is a world in M , is defined as {obj+\ni (M, w ) | w \u2208 Ki (w)}, where obji (M, w ) is a set consisting\nof i-objective formulas true at (M, w\u2032 ).7 Although intuitive, note that, even for the propositional subset of ON L, a Kripke world is a completely different entity from what Levesque supposes. Perhaps,\none consequence is that the semantic proofs in earlier approaches are very involved. In contrast, we\ndefine worlds exactly as Levesque supposes. And, our notion of possibility is obtained from the set of\na-objective formulas true at each hw, ebk\u22121 i in eka .\nDefinition 3.1: Suppose M = (eka , ejb , w) is a (k, j)-model.\n1. let obj+\ni (M ) = {i-objective \u03c6 | M |= \u03c6},\nk\u22121\n+\nk\n2. let Obj +\n, w) | hw, ebk\u22121 i \u2208 eka },\na (ea ) = {obja ({}, eb\nj\nj\u22121\nj\n+ j\u22121\n3. let Obj +\nb (eb ) = {objb (ea , {}, w) | hw, ea i \u2208 eb }.\n6\n7\n\nFor space reasons, we do not review all aspects of these approaches.\nThe superscript + denotes that the set includes non-basic formulas. Given X + , we let X = {\u03c6 is basic | \u03c6 \u2208 X + }.\n\n6\n\n\fAll the a-objective formulas true at a model M , essentially the objective formulas true wrt. w and the\nb-subjective formulas true wrt. ejb , are given by obj+\na (M ). Note that these formulas do not strictly\nk\ncorrespond to a's possibilities. Rather, we define Obj +\na on her epistemic state ea , and this gives us\nall the a-objectives formulas that a considers possible. We shall now argue that the intuition of all of\nLevesque's properties is maintained.8\nProperty 1. In the single agent case, this property ensured that an agent's epistemic possibilities are\nnot affected on evaluating N . This is immediately the case here. Given a model, say (eka , ejb , w),\nk\na's epistemic possibilities are determined by Obj +\na (ea ). To evaluate Na \u03b1, we consider all models\nk\u22121\nk\u22121\nk\n\u2032\n\u2032\nk\nk\n(ea , eb , w ) such that hw , eb i 6\u2208 ea . Again, a's possibilities are given by Obj +\na (ea ) for all these\nmodels, and does not change.\nProperty 2. In the single agent case, this property ensured that evaluating L\u03b1 and N \u03b1 is always\nwrt. the set of all possibilities, and completely independent of e. As discussed, in the many agent\ncase, possibilities mean i-objective formulas and analogously, if \u03b1 is a possibility in a's view, say\nan a-objective formula of maximal b-depth of k, then we should interpret La \u03b1 and Na \u03b1 wrt. all aobjective possibilities of max. depth k: the set of (k + 1)-structures. Clearly then, the result is fixed and\nindependent of the corresponding ek+1 . The following lemma is a direct consequence of the definition\nof the semantics.\nLemma 3.2: Let \u03b1 be a i-objective formula of j-depth k, for j 6= i. Then, the set of k +1-structures\nthat evaluate Li \u03b1 and Ni \u03b1 is Ek+1 .\nProperty 3. The third property ensures that one can characterize epistemic states from any set of iobjective formulas. Intuitively, given such a set, we must have a model where precisely this set is the\nepistemic state. Earlier attempts at clarifying this property involved constructing a set of maximally\nK45n -consistent sets of basic i-objective formulas, and showing that there exist an epistemic state that\nprecisely corresponds to this set. But, defining possibilities via K45n proof-theoretic machinery inevitably leads to some limitations, as we shall see. We instead proceed semantically, and go beyond\nbasic formulas. Let \u03a9 be a satisfiable set of i-objective formulas, say of maximal j-depth k, for j 6= i.\nLet \u03a9\u2032 be a set obtained by adding a i-objective formula \u03b3 of maximal j-depth k such that \u03a9\u2032 is also\nsatisfiable. By considering all i-objective formulas of maximal j-depth k, let us construct \u03a9\u2032 , \u03a9\u2032\u2032 , . . . by\nadding formulas iff the resultant set remains satisfiable. When we are done, the resulting \u03a9\u2217 is what we\nshall call a maximally satisfiable i-objective set.9 Naturally, there may be many such sets corresponding\nto \u03a9. We show that given a set of maximally satisfiable i-objective sets, there is a model where precisely\nthis set characterizes the epistemic state.\nTheorem 3.3: Let Si be a set of maximally satisfiable sets of i-objective formulas, and \u03c3 a satisfiable\nobjective formula. Suppose Sa is of max. b-depth k \u2212 1 and Sb is of max. a-depth j \u2212 1. Then there is a\n+ \u2217j\n\u2217k\nmodel M \u2217 = he\u2217 ka , e\u2217 jb , w\u2217 i such that M \u2217 |= \u03c3, Sa = Obj +\na (e a ) and Sb = Obj b (e b ).\n8\nIt is interesting to note that such a formulation of Levesque's properties is not straightforward in the first-order case. That\nis, for the quantified language, it is known that there are epistemic states that can not be characterized using only objective\nformulas [Levesque & Lakemeyer 2001]. Thus, it is left open how one must correctly generalize the features of first-order\nON L.\n9\nA maximally satisfiable set is to be understood as a semantically characterized complete description of a possibility,\nanalogous to a proof theoretically characterized notion of maximally consistent set of formulas.\n\n7\n\n\fProof: Consider Sa . Each S \u2032 \u2208 Sa is a maximally satisfiable a-objective set, and thus by definition, there is a k-structure hw\u2032 , ebk\u22121 i such that {}, ebk\u22121 , w\u2032 |= S \u2032 . Define such a set of k-structures\n{hw\u2032 , ebk\u22121 i}, corresponding to each S \u2032 \u2208 Sa , and let this be e\u2217ka . It is immediate to verify that\n\u2217j\n\u2217\n\u2217k\nObj +\na (e a ) = Sa . Analogously, for e b using Sb . Finally, there is clearly some world w where \u03c3\nholds.\n\n3.1 On Validity\nHow does the semantics compare to earlier approaches? In particular, we are interested in valid formulas. Lakemeyer ([1993]) proposes a semantics using K45n -canonical models, but he shows that the\nformula \u00acOa \u00acOb p for any proposition p is valid. Intuitively, it says that all that Alice knows is that\nBob does not only know p, and as Lakemeyer argues, the validity of \u00acOa \u00acOb p is unintuitive. After all,\nBob could honestly tell Alice that he does not only know p. The negation of this formula, on the other\nhand, is satisfiable in a Kripke structure approach by Halpern ([1993]), called the i-set approach.10 It\nis also satisfiable in the k-structure semantics. Interestingly, the i-set approach and k-structures agree\non one more notion. The formula La \u22a5 \u2283 \u00acNa \u00acOb \u00acOa p (\u03b6) is valid in both, while \u00ac\u03b6 is satisfiable\nwrt. Lakemeyer ([1993]). (It turns out that the validity of \u03b6 in our semantical framework is implicitly\nrelated to the satisfiability of Ob \u00acOa p, so this property is not unreasonable.)\nHowever, we immediately remark that the i-set approach and k-structures do not share too many\nsimilarities beyond those presented above. In fact, the i-set approach does not truly satisfy Levesque's\nsecond property. For instance, Na \u00acOb p \u2227 La \u00acOb p (\u03bb) is satisfiable in Halpern ([1993]). Recall that,\nin this property, the union of models that evaluate Ni \u03b1 and Li \u03b1 must lead to all conceivable states. So,\nthe satisfiability of \u03bb leaves open the question as to why Ob p is not considered since \u00acOb p is true at all\nconceivable states. We show that, in contrast, \u03bb is not satisfiable in the k-structures approach. Lastly,\n[Halpern & Lakemeyer 2001] involves enriching the language, the intuitions of which are perhaps best\nexplained after reviewing the proof theory, and so we defer discussions to later.11\nTheorem 3.4: The following are properties of the semantics:\n1. Oa \u00acOb p, for any p \u2208 \u03a6, is satisfiable.\n2. |= La \u22a5 \u2283 \u00acNa \u00acOb \u00acOa p.\n3. Na \u00acOb p \u2227 La \u00acOb p is not satisfiable.\nProof: Item 1. Let Wp = {w | w |= p} and let E be all subsets of W except the set Wp . It is easy to\nsee that if e1b \u2208 E, then {}, e1b , w 6|= Ob p, for any world w. Now, define a e2 for a that has all of W \u00d7 E.\nThus, e2a , {}, w |= Oa \u00acOb p.\nItem 2. Suppose eka , {}, w |= La \u22a5 for any w \u2208 W. Then, for all hw\u2032 , ebk\u22121 i \u2208 eka , eka , ebk\u22121 , w\u2032 |= \u22a5,\nand thus, eka = {}. Suppose now eka , {}, w |= Na \u00acOb \u00acOa p. Then, wrt. all of hw\u2032 , ebk\u22121 i 6\u2208 eka i.e. all of\nEk , \u00acOb \u00acOa p must hold. That is, \u00acOb \u00acOa p must be valid. From above, we know this is not the case.\n10\n11\n\nIn his original formulation, Halpern ([1993]) constructs trees. We build on discussions in [Halpern & Lakemeyer 2001].\nAn approach by [Waaler 2004; Waaler & Solhaug 2005] is also motivated by the proof theory. Discussions are deferred.\n\n8\n\n\fItem 3. Suppose eka , {}, w |= La \u00acOb p, for any w. Then, for all hw\u2032 , ebk\u22121 i \u2208 eka , eka , ebk\u22121 , w\u2032 |=\n\u00acOb p. Since Ob p is satisfiable, there is a e\u2217 bk\u22121 such that {}, e\u2217 bk\u22121 , w\u2217 |= Ob p, and hw\u2217 , e\u2217 bk\u22121 i 6\u2208 eka .\nThen, eka , {}, w |= \u00acNa \u00acOb p.\nThus, k-structures seem to satisfy our intuitions on the behavior of only-knowing. To understand why,\nnotice that \u00acOa \u00acOb p and \u03bb involve the nesting of Ni operators. Lakemeyer ([1993]) makes an unavoidable technical commitment. A (i-objective) possibility is formally a maximally K45n -consistent\nset of basic i-objective formulas. The restriction to basic formulas is an artifact of a semantics based on\nthe canonical model. Unfortunately, there is more to agent i's possibility than just basic formulas. In the\ncase of Halpern ([1993]), the problem seems to be that Ni and Li do not interact naturally, and that the\nfull complement of epistemic possibilities is not considered in interpreting Ni . In contrast, Theorem 3.3\nshows that we allow non-basic formulas and by using a strictly semantic notion, we avoid problems that\narise from the proof-theoretic restrictions. And, since the semantics faithfully complies with the second\nproperty, \u03bb is not satisfiable.\nThe natural question is if there are axioms that characterize the semantics. We begin, in the next\nsection, with a proof theory by Lakemeyer ([1993]) that is known to be sound and complete for all\nattempts so far, but for a restricted language.\n\n4 Proof Theory\nIn the single agent case, ON L's proof theory consists of axioms of propositional logic, axioms that\ntreat L and N as a classical belief operator in K45, an axiom that allows us to use N and L freely\non subjective formulas, modus ponens (MP) and necessitation (NEC) for both L and N as inference\nrules, and the following axiom:12\nA5. N \u03b1 \u2283 \u00acL\u03b1 if \u00ac\u03b1 is a propositionally consistent\nobjective formula.\nAs we shall see, only the axiom A5 is controversial, since extending any objective \u03b1 to any i-objective \u03b1\nis problematic. Mainly, the soundness of the axiom in the single agent case relies on propositional logic.\nBut in the multi-agent case, since we go beyond propositional formulas establishing this consistency\nis non-trivial, and even circular. To this end, Lakemeyer ([1993]) proposes to resolve this consistency\nby relying on the existing logic K45n . As a consequence, his proof theoretic formulation appropriately\ngeneralizes all of Levesque's axioms, except for A5 where its application is restricted to only basic\ni-objective consistent formulas. We use \u22a2 to denote provability.\nDefinition 4.1: ON L\u2212\nn consists of all formulas \u03b1 in ON Ln such that no Nj may occur in the scope\nof a Li or a Ni , for i 6= j.\nThe following axioms, along with MP and NEC (for Li and Ni ) is an axiomatization that we refer to\nas AX n . AX n is sound and complete for the canonical model and the i-set approach for formulas in\nON L\u2212\nn.\n12\n\nStrictly speaking, this is not the proof theory introduced in [Levesque 1990], where an axiom replaces the inference rule\nNEC. Here, we consider an equivalent formulation by Halpern and Lakemeyer ([2001]).\n\n9\n\n\fA1n . All instances of propositional logic,\nA2n . Li (\u03b1 \u2283 \u03b2) \u2283 (Li \u03b1 \u2283 Li \u03b2),\nA3n . Ni (\u03b1 \u2283 \u03b2) \u2283 (Ni \u03b1 \u2283 Ni \u03b2),\nA4n . \u03c3 \u2283 Li \u03c3 \u2227 Ni \u03c3 for i-subjective \u03c3,\nA5n . Ni \u03b1 \u2283 \u00acLi \u03b1 if \u00ac\u03b1 is a K45n -consistent\ni-objective basic formula.\nObserve that, as discussed, the soundness of A5n is built on K45n -consistency. Since our semantics is\nnot based on Kripke structures, proving that every K45n -consistent formula is satisfiable in some (k, j)model is not immediate. We propose a construction called the (k, j)-correspondence model. In the\nfollowing, in order to disambiguate W from Kripke worlds, we shall refer to our worlds as propositional\nvaluations.\nDefinition 4.2: The K45n canonical model M c = hW c , \u03c0 c , Kac , Kbc i is defined as follows:\n1.

Let us refer to this model as the (k, j)-correspondence model\nof (M c , w).\nRoughly, Defn. 4.4 is a construction of a (k, j)-model that appeals to the accessibility relations in the\ncanonical model.13 Thus, a e1a for Alice wrt. w has precisely the valuations of Kripke worlds w\u2032 \u2208\nKac (w). Quite analogously, a eka is a set {hJw\u2032 K, ek\u22121 i}, where w\u2032 \u2208 Kac (w) as before, but ek\u22121 is an\nepistemic state for Bob and hence refers all worlds w\u2032\u2032 \u2208 Kbc (w\u2032 ). By a induction on the depth of a\nbasic formula \u03b1, we obtain a theorem that \u03b1 of maximal a, b-depth k, j is satisfiable at (M c , w) iff the\n(k, j)-correspondence model satisfies the formula.\n13\n\nThe construction is somewhat similar to the notion of generated submodels of Kripke frames [Hughes & Cresswell 1984].\n\n10\n\n\fTheorem 4.5: For all basic formulas \u03b1 in ON L\u2212\nn and of maximal a, b-depth of k, j,\nj\nc\nk\nM , w |= \u03b1 iff eJwK a , eJwK b , JwK |= \u03b1.\nProof: By definition, the proof holds for propositional formulas, disjunctions and negations. So let us\nsay the result holds for formulas of a, b-depth 1. Suppose now M c , w |= La \u03b1, where La \u03b1 has a, b-depth\nof 1, 2. Then for all w\u2032 \u2208 Kac (w), M c , w\u2032 |= \u03b1 iff (by induction hypothesis) eJw\u2032 K 1a , eJw\u2032 K 1b , Jw\u2032 K |= \u03b1\niff eJwK 2a , {}, JwK |= La \u03b1.

Since b's structure is\nirrelevant, we get eJwK 1a , eJwK 2b , JwK |= La \u03b1 proving the hypothesis.\nFor the other direction, suppose eJwK 1a , eJwK 2b , JwK |= La \u03b1.

Supposing that the formula has a a, b-depth of k, j then from Thm 4.5, we\nknow there is at least the correspondence (k, j)-model that also satisfies the formula.\nTheorem 4.7:\nFor all \u03b1 \u2208 ON L\u2212\nn , if AX n \u22a2 \u03b1 then |= \u03b1.\nProof: The soundness is easily shown to hold for A1n \u2212 A4n . The soundness of A5n is shown by\ninduction on the depth. Suppose \u03b1 is a propositional formula, and say \u00ac\u03b1 is a consistent propositional\nformula (and hence K45n -consistent). Then there is a world w\u2217 such that {}, {}, w\u2217 |= \u00ac\u03b1. Given a\neka , if hw\u2217 , ebk\u22121 i \u2208 eka for some ebk\u22121 , then eka , {}, w |= \u00acLa \u03b1 for any world w. If not, then eka , {}, w |=\n\u00acNa \u03b1. Thus, eka , {}, w |= Na \u03b1 \u2283 \u00acLa \u03b1. Wlog, assume the proof holds for a-objective formulas of\nmax. b-depth k \u22121. Suppose now, \u03b1 is such a formula, and \u00ac\u03b1 is K45n -consistent. By Lemma 4.6, there\nis hw\u2217 , e\u2217 bk\u22121 i, such that {}, e\u2217 bk\u22121 , w\u2217 |= \u00ac\u03b1. Again, if hw\u2217 , e\u2217 bk\u22121 i \u2208 eka , then eka , {}, w |= \u00acLa \u03b1 and\nif not, then eka , {}, w |= \u00acNa \u03b1.\nWe proceed with the completeness over the following definition, and lemmas.\nDefinition 4.8: A formula \u03c8 is said to be independent of the formula \u03c6 wrt. an axiom system AX, if\nneither AX \u22a2 \u03c6 \u2283 \u03c8 nor AX \u22a2 \u03c6 \u2283 \u00ac\u03c8.\nLemma 4.9: [Halpern and Lakemeyer, 2001] If \u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6m are K45n -consistent basic i-objective formulas then there exists a basic i-objective formula \u03c8 of the form Lj \u03c8 \u2032 (j 6= i) that is independent of\n\u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6m wrt.

If \u03be is basic, then by Lemma 4.6, the statement holds. If \u03be is not basic, then wlog, it can be\nconsidered in the normal form:\nW\n(\u03c3 \u2227 La\u03c6a0 \u2227 \u00acLa \u03c6a1 . . . \u2227 \u00acLa\u03c6am1 \u2227 Lb \u03c6b0 . . . \u2227 \u00acLb \u03c6bm2 \u2227 Na \u03c8a0 . . . \u2227 \u00acNa \u03c8an1 \u2227 Nb \u03c8b0 . . . \u2227\n\u00acNb \u03c8bn2 )\nwhere \u03c3 is a propositional formula, and \u03c6im and \u03c8in are i-objective and basic. Since \u03c3 is propositional\nand consistent, there is clearly a world w\u2217 such that w\u2217 |= \u03c3. We construct a k\u2032 -structure such that it\nsatisfies all the a-subjective formulas in the normal form above. Following that, a j \u2032 -structure for all the\nb-subjective formulas is constructed identically. The resulting (k\u2032 , j \u2032 )-model (with w\u2217 ) satisfies \u03be.\nLet A be all K45n -consistent formulas of the form \u03c6a0 \u2227 \u03c8a0 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c6aj (for j \u2265 1) or the form\n\u03c6a0 \u2227 \u03c8a0 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c8aj . Let \u03b3 be independent of all formulas in A, as in Lemma 4.9 and 4.10. Note that,\nwhile we take \u03be itself to be of maximal a, b-depth of k, j, the depth of \u03c6a0 , . . . being a-objective are of\nmaximal b-depth k \u2212 1, and hence \u03b3 is of b-depth 2k (Lemma 4.10). Given a consistent set of formulas,\nthe standard Lindenbaum construction can be used to construct a maximally consistent set of formulas,\nall of a maximal b-depth k \u2212 1. That is, a formula is considered in the construction only if it has a\nmaximal b-depth k \u2212 1. Now, let Sa be a set of all maximally consistent sets of formulas, constructed by\nonly considering formulas of maximal b-depth k \u2212 1, and containing \u03c6a0 \u2227 (\u00ac\u03c8a0 \u2228 (\u03c8a0 \u2227 \u03b3)). Since\neach of these consistent sets are basic and a-objective, they are satisfiable by Lemma 4.6. Thus the sets\n\u2032\na k\u2032 -structure for\nS \u2032 \u2208 Sa are satisfiable wrt. 2k-structures hw, e2k\nb i. Let k = 2k + 1. By constructing\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nk\nk\n2k\nAlice, say ea , from each hw, eb i for every S \u2208 Sa , we have that Obja (ea ) = Sa . We shall show that\n\u2032\nall the a-subjective formulas in the normal form are satisfied wrt. heka , {}, w\u2217 i.\n\u2032\n\nSince for all S \u2032 \u2208 Sa , we have \u03c6a0 \u2208 S \u2032 we get that eka , {}, w\u2217 |= La \u03c6a0 . Now, since La \u03c6a0 \u2227\n\u00acLa \u03c6aj is consistent, it must be that \u03c6a0 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c6aj is consistent. For suppose not, then \u00ac\u03c6a0 \u2228 \u03c6aj is\nprovable and thus, we have \u03c6a0 \u2283 \u03c6aj . We then prove La \u03c6a0 \u2283 La \u03c6aj , and since we have La \u03c6a0 we\nprove La \u03c6aj , clearly inconsistent with La \u03c6a0 \u2227 \u00acLa \u03c6aj . Now that \u03c6a0 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c6aj is consistent, we either\nhave that \u03c6a0 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c6aj \u2227 \u03c8a0 or \u03c6a0 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c6aj \u2227 \u00ac\u03c8a0 is consistent. With the former, we also have that\n\u03c6a0 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c6aj \u2227 \u03c8a0 \u2227 \u03b3 is consistent. There are maximally consistent sets that contain one of them, both\n\u2032\nof which contain \u00ac\u03c6aj . This means that, eka , {}, w\u2217 |= \u00acLa \u03c6aj .\n\u2032\n\nk\nNow, consider some k\u2032 -structure hw\u2022 , e\u20222k\nb i 6\u2208 ea . One of the following a-objective formulas must\nhold wrt. this k\u2032 -structure: (a) \u03c6a0 \u2227 \u03c8a0 , (b) \u03c6a0 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c8a0 , (c) \u00ac\u03c6a0 \u2227 \u03c8a0 or (d) \u00ac\u03c6a0 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c8a0 . It can\nnot be (d), since La \u03c6a0 \u2227 Na \u03c8a0 is consistent, and this implies that \u03c6a0 \u2228 \u03c8a0 is valid (by Lemma\n4.11). It certainly cannot be (b), for it would be in some S \u2032 \u2208 Sa . This leaves us with options (c) and\n\u2032\n(a), both of which have \u00ac\u03c8a0 . Since the k\u2032 -structure was arbitrary, we must have for all hw, e2k\ni 6\u2208 eka ,\nb\nk\u2032\n\u2217\n{}, e2k\nb , w |= \u03c8a0 . Thus, ea , {}, w |= Na \u03c8a0 .\n\n12\n\n\fFinally, since Na \u03c8a0 \u2227 \u00acNa \u03c8aj is consistent, it must be that \u03c8a0 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c8aj is consistent. Further,\neither \u03c8a0 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c8aj \u2227 \u03c6a0 or \u03c8a0 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c8aj \u2227 \u00ac\u03c6a0 is consistent. If the former, then \u03c8a0 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c8aj \u2227 \u03c6a0 \u2227 \u00ac\u03b3\nis also consistent. Let \u03b2 be that which is consistent. Note that \u00ac\u03b2 \u2227 (\u03c6a0 \u2227 (\u00ac\u03c8a0 \u2228 (\u03c8a0 \u2227 \u03b3))) is\n\u2032\nconsistent, and hence part of all S \u2032 \u2208 Sa . This means that eka , {}, w\u2217 |= La (\u00ac\u03b2). But since \u03b2 itself is\n\u2032\nconsistent, there is a k\u2032 -structure such that {}, e\u2022(b,2k) , w\u2022 |= \u03b2. And this k\u2032 -structure can not be in eka .\n\u2032\n\nThis means that eka , {}, w\u2217 |= \u00acNa \u03c8aj . Thus, all the a-subjective formulas in the normal form above\n\u2032\nare satisfiable wrt. eka .\nNow, observe that, although La \u22a5 \u2283 \u00acNa \u00acOb \u00acOa p (\u03b6) from Theorem 3.4 is valid, yet it is not derivable from AX n . In fact, the soundness result is easily extended to the full language ON Ln . Then, the\nproof theory cannot be complete for the full language since there is \u03b6 \u2208 ON Ln such that 6\u22a2 \u03b6 and |= \u03b6.\nSimilarly, the validity of non-provable formulas \u00acOa \u00acOb p and \u03b6 wrt. the canonical model and the i-set\napproach respectively, show that although AX n is also sound for the full language in these approaches,\nit cannot be compelete. Mainly, axiom A5n has to somehow go beyond basic formulas. As Halpern and\nLakemeyer ([2001]) discuss, the problem is one of circularity. We would like the axiom to hold for any\n\u03b1 such that it is a consistent i-objective formula, but to deal with consistency we have to clarify what\nthe axiom system looks like.\nThe approach taken by Halpern and Lakemeyer is to introduce validity (and its dual satisfiability)\ndirectly into the language. Formulas in the new language, ON L+\nn , are shown to be provably equivalent\nto ON Ln . Some new axioms involving validity and satisfiability are added to the axiom system, and\n+\nthe resultant proof theory AX +\nn is shown to be sound and complete for formulas in ON Ln , wrt. an\nextended canonical model. (An extended canonical model follows the spirit of the canonical model\nconstruction but by considering maximally AX +\nn -consistent sets, and treat Li and Ni as two independent modal operators.) So, one approach is to show that for formulas in the extended language the set\nof valid formulas overlap in the extended canonical model and k-structures. But then, as we argued,\naxiomatizing validity is not natural. Also, the proof theory is difficult to use. And in the end, we would\nstill understand the axioms to characterize a semantics bridged on proof-theoretic elements.\nAgain, what is desired is a generalization of Levesque's axiom A5, and nothing more. To this end,\nwe propose a new axiom system, that is subtly related to the structure of formulas as are parameters k\nand j. The axiom system has an additional t-axioms, and is to correspond to a sequence of languages\nON Ltn .14\nt+1\nDefinition 4.14: Let ON L1n = ON L\u2212\nbe all Boolean combinations of formulas of\nn .

The case of AX 1n is identical to Theorem 4.7. So, for the induction\nhypothesis, let us assume that wrt. AX tn , if AX tn \u22a2 \u03b2 for \u03b2 \u2208 ON Ltn then |= \u03b2. Now, suppose that\n\u00ac\u03b1 is consistent wrt. AX tn and is a-objective. This implies that 6|= \u03b1. Thus, there is some k-structure\n\u2032\nhw\u2217 , e\u2217 kb i such that {}, e\u2217 kb , w\u2217 |= \u00ac\u03b1.

Thus, ea , {}, w |= Na \u03b1 \u2283 \u00acLa \u03b1, demonstrating the soundness\nof AX t+1\nn .\nWe establish completeness in a manner identical to Theorem 4.13, and thus it necessary to ensure that\nLemma 4.9, 4.10 and 4.11 hold for non-basic formulas.\nLemma 4.16: If \u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6m are AX tn -consistent i-objective formulas, then there is a basic formula \u03c8\nof the form Lj \u03c8 (j 6= i) that is independent of \u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6m wrt. AX tn .\nProof: Suppose that \u03c6i are a-objective and of maximal b-depth k. A formula \u03c8 of the form (Lb La )k+1 p\n(where p \u2208 \u03a6 is in the scope of k + 1 Lb La ) is shown to be independent of \u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6m . Let us suppose\nwe can derive a \u03b3 of the form Lb La Lb La . . . p of maximal depth k, to show that neither \u22a2 \u03b3 \u2283 \u03c8 nor\n\u22a2 \u03b3 \u2283 \u00ac\u03c8. Given any formula, the only axioms in AX tn that can introduce \u03b3 in the scope of modal\noperators is A4n and A5tn . Applying A4n gives Lb \u03b3 or Nb \u03b3, and then using the axiom again we have\nLb Lb \u03b3 or Lb Nb \u03b3. It is easy to see that the resulting formulas are clearly independent from \u03c8. Applying\nA5tn on the other hand, allows us to derive \u22a2 \u03b3 \u2283 Na \u03b3 or \u22a2 \u03b3 \u2283 \u00acLa \u03b3 (\u03b3 is consistent wrt. AX tn and\nhence also wrt. A5t\u22121\nn ). Again, we could show \u22a2 \u03b3 \u2283 \u00acLb \u00acLa \u03b3. Continuing this way, it might only\nbe possible to derive \u00acLb \u00acLa . . .

It is sufficient to show that if a formula \u03b2 \u2208 ON Lt+1\nis AX t+1\nn\nn 1\nconsistent then it is satisfiable wrt. some model. We already have the proof for ON Ln (see Theorem\n4.13). Let us assume the proof holds for all formulas \u03b1 \u2208 ON Ltn . Particularly, this means that any\nformula that is AX tn -consistent is satisfiable wrt. some (k\u2032 , j \u2032 )-model. Let \u03b1 \u2208 ON Lt+1\n(say of\nn\nt+1\nmaximal a, b-depth of k + 1, j + 1), and suppose that \u03b1 is consistent wrt. AX n . It is sufficient to show\nthat \u03b1 is satisfiable. Wlog, we take it in the normal form:\nW\n(\u03c3 \u2227 La\u03c6a0 \u2227 \u00acLa \u03c6a1 . . . \u2227 \u00acLa\u03c6am1 \u2227 Lb \u03c6b0 . . . \u2227 \u00acLb \u03c6bm2 \u2227 Na \u03c8a0 . . . \u2227 \u00acNa \u03c8an1 \u2227 Nb \u03c8b0 . . . \u2227\n\u00acNb \u03c8bn2 ).\nNote that, by definition, it must be that all of \u03c6im , \u03c8in are at most in ON Ltn (i.e. they may also be in\nON Lt\u22121\nn , . . .), and i-objective. We proceed as we did for Theorem 4.13 but without restricting to basic\n14\n\n\fformulas. Let A be all AX tn -consistent formulas of the form \u03c6a0 \u2227\u03c8a0 \u2227\u00ac\u03c6aj or \u03c6a0 \u2227\u03c8a0 \u2227\u00ac\u03c8aj (they\nare of maximal b-depth k). Let \u03b3 be independent of all formulas in A. Let Sa be the set of all (AX tn -)\nmaximally consistent sets of formulas, constructed from formulas of maximal b-depth k, and containing\n\u03c6a0 \u2227 (\u00ac\u03c8a0 \u2228 (\u03c8a0 \u2227 \u03b3)), and hence by induction hypothesis they are satisfiable in some model. Note\nthat all formulas in Sa are in ON Ltn . The b-depth is maximally 2k + 2. Letting k\u2032\u2032 = 2k + 2, we have\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nthat for all S \u2032 \u2208 Sa , there is a hw, ekb i such that {}, ekb , w |= S \u2032 . Let k\u2032 = k\u2032\u2032 + 1. Letting eka be all\n\u2032\u2032\nk\u2032\nsuch k\u2032 -structures hw, ekb i for each S \u2032 \u2208 Sa makes Obj +\na (ea ) = Sa (in contrast, for Thereom 4.13 we\ndealt with Obja ). We claim that this k\u2032 -structure for Alice, a j \u2032 -structure for Bob constructed similarly,\nand a world where \u03c3 holds (there is such a world since \u03c3 is propositional and consistent) is a model\nwhere \u03b1 is satisfied. The proof proceeds as in Theorem 4.13. We show the case of \u00acLa \u03c6aj .\nt+1\nSince La \u03c6a0 \u2227\u00acLa \u03c6aj is consistent wrt. AX t+1\nn , it must be that \u03c6a0 \u2227\u00ac\u03c6aj is consistent wrt. AX n .\nt\nt\nFurther, since \u03c6a0 , \u03c6aj \u2208 ON Ln , they must consistent be wrt. AX n (for if not, they cannot by definition\nbe consistent wrt. AX t+1\nn ). This means that either \u03c6a0 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c6aj \u2227 \u03c8a0 or \u03c6a0 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c6aj \u2227 \u00ac\u03c8a0 is consistent.\nIf the former is, then so is \u03c6a0 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c6aj \u2227 \u03c8a0 \u2227 \u03b3. Since Sa consist of all AX tn -consistent formulas\ncontaining \u03c6a0 \u2227 (\u00ac\u03c8a0 \u2227 (\u03c8a0 \u2227 \u03b3)), there is clearly a S \u2032 \u2208 Sa such that \u00ac\u03c6aj \u2208 S \u2032 . Consequently, it\n\u2032\n\u2032\ncan not be that eka , {}, w\u2032 |= La \u03c6aj . Thus, eka , {}, w\u2032 |= \u00acLa \u03c6aj .\n\nThus, we have a sound and complete axiomatization for the propositional fragment of ON Ln . In\ncomparison to Lakemeyer ([1993]), the axiomatization goes beyond a language that restricts the nesting\nof Ni . In contrast to Halpern and Lakemeyer ([2001]), the axiomatization does not necessitate the use of\nsemantic notions in the proof theory. A third axiomatization by [Waaler 2004; Waaler & Solhaug 2005]\nproposes an interesting alternative to deal with the circularity in a generalized A5. The idea is to\nfirst define consistency by formulating a fragment of the axiom system in the sequent calculus. Quite\nanalogous to having t-axioms, they allow us to apply A5n on i-objective formulas of a lower depth,\nthus avoiding circularity without the need to appeal to satisfiability as in [Halpern & Lakemeyer 2001].\nWaaler and Solhaug ([2005]) also define a semantics for multi-agent only-knowing which does not\nappeal to canonical models. Instead, they define a class of Kripke structures which need to satisfy\ncertain constraints. Unfortunately, these constraints are quite involved and, as the authors admit, the\nnature of these models \"is complex and hard to penetrate.\"\nTo get a feel of the axiomatization, let us consider a well studied example from [Halpern & Lakemeyer 2001]\nto see where we differ. Suppose Alice assumes the following default: unless I know that Bob knows my\nsecret then he does not know it. If the default is all that she knows, then she nonmonotonically comes\nto believe that Bob does not know her secret. Let \u03b3 be a proposition that denotes Alice's secret, and\nwe want to show that \u22a2 Oa (\u03b4) \u2283 La \u00acLb \u03b3, where \u03b4 = \u00acLa Lb \u03b3 \u2283 \u00acLb \u03b3. We write (Def.) to mean\nOa \u03b1 \u2261 La \u03b1 \u2227 Na \u00ac\u03b1, and we freely reason with propositional logic (PL) or K45n .\n1. Oa (\u03b4) \u2283 La \u00acLa Lb \u03b3 \u2283 La \u00acLb \u03b3\n\nDef.,PL,A2n\n\n2. Oa (\u03b4) \u2283 Na \u00acLa Lb \u03b3 \u2227 Na Lb \u03b3\n\nDef.,PL,K45n\n\n3. Na Lb \u03b3 \u2283 \u00acLa Lb \u03b3\n\nA51n\n\n4. \u00acLa Lb \u03b3 \u2283 La \u00acLa Lb \u03b3\n\nA4n\n\n5. Oa (\u03b4) \u2283 La \u00acLa Lb \u03b3\n\n2,3,4,PL\n\n6. Oa (\u03b4) \u2283 La \u00acLb \u03b3\n\n1,5,PL\n15\n\n\fWe use A51n , and it is applicable because \u00acLb \u03b3 is a-objective and K45n -consistent. Now, suppose\nAlice is cautious. She changes her default to assume that if she does not believe Bob to only-know some\nset of facts \u03b8 \u2208 \u03a6, then \u03b8 is not all that he knows. We would like to show\n\u22a2 Oa (\u00acLa Ob \u03b8 \u2283 \u00acOb \u03b8) \u2283 La \u00acOb \u03b8\nOf course, this default is different from \u03b4 in containing Ob \u03b8 rather than Lb \u03b3. The proof is identical,\nexcept that we use A52n , since \u00acOb \u03b8 \u2208 ON L1n is a-objective and AX 1n -consistent. The latter proof\nrequires reasoning with the satisfiability modal operator in Halpern and Lakemeyer ([2001]), and is not\nprovable with the axioms of Lakemeyer ([1993]).\n\n5 Autoepistemic Logic\nHaving examined the properties of multi-agent only-knowing, in terms of a semantics for both the firstorder and propositional case, and an axiomatization for the propositional case, in the current section\nwe discuss how the semantics also captures autoepistemic logic (AEL). AEL, as originally developed\nby Moore ([1985]), intends to allow agents to draw conclusions, by making observations of their own\nepistemic states. For instance, Alice concludes that she has no brother because if she did have one then\nshe would have known about it, and she does not know about it [Moore 1985]. The characterization\nof such beliefs are defined using fixpoints called stable expansions. In the single agent case, Levesque\n([1990]) showed that the beliefs of an agent who only-knows \u03b1 is precisely the stable expansion of \u03b1.\nOf course, the leverage with the former is that it is specified using regular entailments. In Lakemeyer\n([1993]), and Halpern and Lakemeyer ([2001]), a many agent generalization of AEL is considered\nin the sense of a stable expansion for every agent, and relating this to what the agent only-knows. But\ntheir generalizations are only for the propositional fragment, while Levesque's definitions involved firstorder entailments. In contrast, we obtain the corresponding quantificational multi-agent generalization\nof AEL. We state the main theorems below. The proofs are omitted since they follow very closely from\nthe ideas for the single agent case [Levesque & Lakemeyer 2001].\nDefinition 5.1: Let A be a set of formulas, and \u0393 is the i-stable expansion of A iff it the set of first-order\nimplications of A \u222a {Li \u03b2 | \u03b2 \u2208 \u0393} \u222a {\u00acLi \u03b2 | \u03b2 6\u2208 \u0393}.\nDefinition 5.2: [Maximal structure] If eka is a k-structure, let e+\na be a k-structure with the addition of all\nof\nmaximal\na,\nb-depth k, k \u2212 1, if eka , {}, w |= La \u03b1 for\nhw\u2032 , ebk\u22121 i 6\u2208 eka such that for every \u03b1 \u2208 ON L\u2212\nn\nany world w then eka , ebk\u22121 , w\u2032 |= \u03b1. Define \u0393 = {\u03b2 | \u03b2 is basic and e+\na , {}, w |= La \u03b2} as the belief set\n.\nof e+\na\nj\n+\nTheorem 5.3: Let M = he+\na , eb , wi be a model, where ea is a maximal structure for a. Let \u0393 be the\n\u2212\n+\nbelief set of ea , and suppose \u03b1 \u2208 ON Ln is of maximal a, b-depth k, k \u2212 1. Then, M |= Oa \u03b1 iff \u0393 is\nthe a-stable expansion of \u03b1.\n\nTheorem 5.3 essentially says that the complete set of basic beliefs at a maximal epistemic state where \u03b1\nis all that i knows, precisely coincides with the i-stable expansion of \u03b1.\n\n16\n\n\f6 Axiomatizing Validity\nExtending the work in [Lakemeyer 1993] and [Halpern 1993], which was only restricted to formulas in\nON L\u2212\nn , Halpern and Lakemeyer ([2001]) proposed a multi-agent only-knowing logic that handles the\nnesting of Ni operators. But as discussed, there are two undesirable features. The first is a semantics\nbased on canonical models, and the second is a proof theory that axiomatizes validity. Although such a\nconstruction is far from natural, we show in this section that they do indeed capture the desired properties\nof only-knowing. This also instructs us that our axiomatization avoids such problems in a reasonable\nmanner.\nRecall that the language of [Halpern & Lakemeyer 2001] is ON L+\nn , which is ON Ln and a modal\noperator for validity, Val. A modal operator Sat, for satisfiability, is used freely such that Val(\u03b1) is\nsyntactically equivalent to \u00acSat(\u00ac\u03b1). To enable comparisons, we present a variant of our logic, that\nhas all its main features, but has additional notions to handle the extended language. We then show that\nthis logic and [Halpern & Lakemeyer 2001] agree on the set of valid sentences from ON L+\nn (and also\nON Ln ).\nThe main feature of [Halpern & Lakemeyer 2001] is the proof theory AX \u2032n , and a semantics that is\nsound and complete for AX \u2032n via the extended canonical model. AX \u2032n consists of A1n \u2212 A4n , MP,\nNEC and the following:\nA5\u2032n . Sat(\u00ac\u03b1) \u2283 (Ni \u03b1 \u2283 \u00acLa \u03b1), if \u03b1 is i-objective.\nV1. Val(\u03b1) \u2227 Val(\u03b1 \u2283 \u03b2) \u2283 Val(\u03b2).\nV2. Sat(p1 \u2227 . . . pn ), if pi 's are literals and p1 \u2227 . . . pn is\npropositionally consistent.\nV3. Sat(\u03b1 \u2227 \u03b21 ) \u2227 . . . Sat(\u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2k ) \u2227 Sat(\u03b3 \u2227 \u03b41 ) . . . \u2227\nSat(\u03b3 \u2227 \u03b4m ) \u2227 Val(\u03b1 \u2228 \u03b3) \u2283 Sat(Li \u03b1 \u2227 \u00acLi \u00ac\u03b21 . . . \u2227\nNi \u03b3 \u2227 \u00acNi \u00ac\u03b41 . . .), if \u03b1, \u03b2i , \u03b3, \u03b4i are i-objective.\nV4. Sat(\u03b1) \u2227 Sat(\u03b2) \u2283 Sat(\u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2), if \u03b1 is i-objective\nand \u03b2 is i-subjective.\nNECVal . From \u03b1 infer Val(\u03b1).\nThe essence of our new logic, in terms of a notion of depth (with |Val(\u03b1)|i = |\u03b1|i ) and a semantical\naccount over possible worlds, is as before. The complete semantic definition for formulas in ON L+\nn of\nmaximal a, b-depth of k, j is:\n1. -8. as before,\n9. eka , ejb , w |= Val(\u03b1) if eka , ejb , w |= \u03b1 for all eka , ejb , w.\n1\n\nt\n\n+\nSatisfiability and validity (|=) are understood analogously.15 Let ON L+\nn , . . . ON Ln be also defined\nt\nt\nanalogously. Further, let axioms A1n \u2212 A5tn be defined for ON L+\nn . For instance, A5n is defined for\n15\n\nNote that Val corresponds precisely to how validity is defined.\n\n17\n\n\ft\u22121\n\nany i-objective \u00ac\u03b1 \u2208 ON L+\nthat is consistent with A1n \u2212 A5t\u22121\nn\nn . Then, the semantics above is\nt\n+t\nt\ncharacterized by the proof theory AX n defined (inductively) for ON L+\nn , consisting of AX n (A1n \u2212\nt\nA5n , MP, NEC) with NECVal as an additional inference rule.\nt\n\nt\n\n+\nLemma 6.1: For all \u03b1 \u2208 ON L+\nn , AX n \u22a2 \u03b1 iff |= \u03b1.\n\nThe proof of this lemma, and those of the following theorems are given in the appendix. We proceed to\nt\nshow that Sat(\u03b1) is provable from AX \u2032n iff \u03b1 is AX +\nn -consistent.\nt\n\nt\n\n\u2032\n+\nTheorem 6.2: For all \u03b1 \u2208 ON L+\nn , AX n \u22a2 Sat(\u03b1) iff \u03b1 is AX n -consistent.\nt\n\nThis allows us to show that AX \u2032n and AX +\nn agree on provable sentences.\nt\n\nt\n\n\u2032\n+\nTheorem 6.3: For all \u03b1 \u2208 ON L+\nn , AX n \u22a2 \u03b1 iff AX n \u22a2 \u03b1.\nt\n\nLemma 6.4: For all \u03b1 \u2208 ON L+\nn , |= \u03b1 iff \u03b1 is valid in\n[Halpern & Lakemeyer 2001].\nt\n\nProof: AX \u2032n is sound and complete for [Halpern & Lakemeyer 2001], and AX +\nn is sound and complete for |=.\n\u2032\nSince it can be shown that every \u03b1 \u2208 ON L+\nn is provably equivalent to some \u03b1 \u2208 ON Ln [Halpern & Lakemeyer 2001],\nwe also obtain the following corollary.\n\nCorollary 6.5: For all \u03b1 \u2208 ON Ltn , |= \u03b1 iff \u03b1 is valid in [Halpern & Lakemeyer 2001].\n\n7 Conclusions\nThis paper has the following new results. We have a first-order modal logic for multi-agent onlyknowing that we show, for the first time, generalizes Levesque's semantics. Unlike all attempts so far, we\nneither make use of proof-theoretic notions of maximal consistency nor Kripke structures [Waaler & Solhaug 2005].\nThe benefit is that the semantic proofs are straightforward, and we understand possible worlds precisely\nas Levesque meant. We then analyzed a propositional subset, and showed first that the axiom system\nfrom Lakemeyer ([1993]) is sound and complete for a restricted language. We used this result to devise a\nnew proof theory that does not require us axiomatize any semantic notions [Halpern & Lakemeyer 2001].\nOur axiomatization was shown to be sound and complete for the semantics, and its use is straightforward on formulas involving the nesting of at most operators. In the process, we revisited the features\nof only-knowing and compared the semantical framework to other approaches. Its behavior seems to\ncoincide with our intuitions, and it also captures a multi-agent generalization of Moore's AEL. Finally,\nalthough the axiomatization of Halpern and Lakemeyer ([2001]) is not natural, we showed that they\nessentially capture the desired properties of multi-agent only-knowing, but at much expense.\n\n8 Acknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank the reviewers for helpful suggestions and comments.

Using Theorems 4.15 and 4.18 as the base cases in the induction,\nthere is one additional step on the structure of formulas.\nSoundness: The base case holds for formulas \u03b1 \u2208 ON Ltn for AX tn .

Assume theorem holds for \u03b1 \u2208 ON Ln\n+ t\u22121\n\u2032\nSat(\u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2k ), Sat(\u03b3 \u2227 \u03b4m ), \u00acSat(\u00ac(\u03b1 \u2228 \u03b3)) \u2208 ON Ln\nthen by V3, AX n \u22a2 Sat(Li \u03b1 \u2227 \u00acLi \u00ac\u03b2k \u2227\nt\n+t\nNi \u03b3 \u2227 \u00acNi \u00ac\u03b4m ). By hypothesis \u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2k , \u03b3 \u2227 \u03b4m are AX +\nn -consistent. And \u00ac(\u03b1 \u2228 \u03b3) is not AX n t\nconsistent, and so AX +\nn \u22a2 \u03b1 \u2228 \u03b3. By Lemma 6.1, |= \u03b1 \u2228 \u03b3. Clearly, by Corollary 9.2, Li \u03b1 \u2227 \u00acLi \u00ac\u03b2k \u2227\nt\nNi \u03b3 \u2227 \u00acNi \u00ac\u03b4m is AX +\nn -consistent. Finally, suppose that you have Sat(\u03b1) for some i-objective \u03b1 and\nSat(\u03b2) for some i-subjective \u03b2, then by V4, AX \u2032n \u22a2 Sat(\u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2). By induction hypothesis, \u03b1 and \u03b2 are\nt\nAX +\nn -consistent. By Lemma 6.1, \u03b1 is satisfiable and \u03b2 is satisfiable, and so is \u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2. By Lemma 6.1,\nt\n\u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2 is AX +\nn -consistent. The other direction is symmetric.\nt\n\nt\n\n+\nTheorem 6.3. AX \u2032n \u22a2 \u03b1 iff AX +\nn \u22a2 \u03b1, for \u03b1 \u2208 ON Ln .\n\nProof: Since axioms A1n \u2212 A4n , MP, NEC, NECVal are common to both, their use is not\nt\ndiscussed. To show that AX \u2032n \u22a2 \u03b1 \u21d2 AX +\nn \u22a2 \u03b1, suppose you had Sat(\u00ac\u03b1) for some i-objective\nt\u22121\n\u03b1 \u2208 ON L+\nthen using A5\u2032n , one could show that Ni \u03b1 \u2283 \u00acLi \u03b1. From Theorem 6.2, we also\nn\nt\u22121\nknow \u00ac\u03b1 is AX +\n-consistent. Then, we can show Ni \u03b1 \u2283 \u00acLi \u03b1 as well using A5tn . V2, V3, V4\nn\nfollow immediately from Theorem 6.2. Assuming now that the proof holds for base cases, using V1,\nif AX \u2032n \u22a2 Val(\u03b1) and AX \u2032n \u22a2 Val(\u03b1 \u2283 \u03b2) then AX \u2032n \u22a2 Val(\u03b2). Now, by induction hypothesis,\nt\nAX +\nn \u22a2 Val(\u03b1) iff by Lemma 6.1 |= Val(\u03b1), and so |= \u03b1. Similarly, |= \u03b1 \u2283 \u03b2, and thus, |= \u03b2 and\nt\n|= Val(\u03b2) by the semantics. By Lemma 6.1, AX +\nn \u22a2 Val(\u03b2).\nt\n\nt\u22121\n\n\u2032\n+\nTo show that AX +\nis i-objective and AX t\u22121\nn \u22a2 \u03b1 \u21d2 AX n \u22a2 \u03b1, suppose \u00ac\u03b1 \u2208 ON Ln\nn +t\nconsistent, then one can prove Ni \u03b1 \u2283 \u00acLi \u03b1. Now, \u00ac\u03b1 is also AX n -consistent and by Theorem 6.2,\nAX \u2032n \u22a2 Sat(\u00ac\u03b1). Then we can prove Ni \u03b1 \u2283 \u00acLi \u03b1, as desired.\n\n20\n\n\f"}
