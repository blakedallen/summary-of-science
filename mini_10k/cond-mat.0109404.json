The expressions for Mfl in randomly oriented powders are derived in the\nGaussian approximation of local Ginzburg-Landau theory and used for the analysis of the data.

Our data, besides providing\nthe isothermal magnetization curves for T > Tc (0) in a BCS-type superconductor such as MgB2 ,\nevidence an enhancement of the fluctuating diamagnetism which is related to the occurrence in this\nnew superconductor of an anisotropic spectrum of the superconducting fluctuations.\n\nPACS numbers: 74.40.+k, 74.30.-e, 74.70.-b, 74.20.De\nThermodynamical fluctuations on approaching the superconducting (SC) transition temperature from above yield\nthe formation of evanescent SC droplets causing a bulk diamagnetic magnetization \u2212Mfl . This fluctuating diamagnetism is strongly enhanced in high temperature superconductors with respect to conventional SC's because of the\nhigh temperature range and of the anisotropy of the cuprates [1]. In spite of the difficulty of evidencing the superconducting fluctuations (SF) in low-temperature conventional BCS superconductors, the fluctuating diamagnetism\n(FD) can be detected also in these systems by means of SQUID magnetization measurements. Early data for Mfl at\nconstant field as a function of temperature in zero dimensional limit (aluminum particles of size less than 1000 \u00c5)\nand in metals compounds, evidenced the rounding of the transition due to SF and the effect of the magnetic field in\nquenching the fluctuating Cooper pairs [2]. From the measurements of Mfl vs T of Gollub et al. [3] one can deduce\nthe occurrence of an upturn in the field dependence of Mfl : for H \u226a Hup the diamagnetic magnetization increases\nwith H while for H\u223c> Hup the field tends to suppress the fluctuating magnetization. The upturn field Hup can be\napproximately related to the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) coherence length \u03be(T ) (see later on). Most likely in view of the\nsmall value of Mfl in conventional BCS superconductors, isothermal magnetization curves Mfl vs H have not been\nstudied in detail, in the authors's knowledge. The relevance of the field dependence of Mfl (T, H) for the study of\nFD has been recently stressed in the framework of a Gaussian GL approach for non-isotropic systems [4,5]. The\nnew superconductor MgB2 [6], although being of \"conventional\" BCS character has two characteristics that can be\nexpected to enhance SF and therefore the value of Mfl at T = Tc (0): the high value of the transition temperature\nand, as we will deduce later on, an anisotropic spectrum of the fluctuations, similarly to cuprate superconductors.\nThis report deals with a study of FD in MgB2 by means of high resolution SQUID magnetization measurements,\n<\nwith a successful detection of the magnetization curves \u2013Mfl vs H in the temperature range Tc (0) <\n\u223c T \u223c Tc (0)+0.5 K.\nFrom the experimental findings we have been able to prove that Mfl and its field dependence are close to the one\npredicted by theories based on the extension of the GL approach to include short wavelength fluctuations of the\norder parameter and non local electrodynamic effects. It is also deduced that MgB2 has an anisotropic spectrum of\nfluctuations, with remarkable enhancement of the FD.\nThe measurements have been carried out by means of the Quantum Design MPMS-XL7 SQUID magnetometer,\nallowing one to achieve temperature resolution up to 1 mK and the measure of a lowest magnetic moment value\naround 10\u22127 emu, in practice corresponding with our samples to the detectability of Mfl in field less than one\nOersted. The magnetic field could be increased up to 7\u00d7104 Oe. The sample was prepared by Palenzona et al.\n(University of Genova) starting from high purity B and Mg powders, heated at 950 \u25e6 C for 24 hs. A temperatureindependent paramagnetic magnetization was detected in the range 100-40 K, yielding a volume Pauli susceptibility\naround 2\u00d710\u22127. The diamagnetic magnetization around Tc was obtained from the raw data by subtracting the\nparamagnetic magnetization, as well as the temperature-independent correction due to the sample holder. Zero field\ncooled (ZFC) magnetization curves have been compared to field cooled (FC) data, obtained by cooling to a given\ntemperature in the presence of different fields.\n1\n\n\fIn Fig. 1 the temperature dependence of the scaled volume magnetization m = \u2212Mfl /H 1/2 Tc is reported, for MgB2 ,\nand for comparison (see discussion later on), for optimally doped YBCO (oriented powder). One can deduce the\nfollowing. In the temperature range indicated by a), m linearly decreases on increasing temperature, corresponding to\na diamagnetic susceptibility going as (1 \u2212 T /Tc (H)) as expected [2,3] outside from the critical region below Tc . From\nthis behaviour one can deduce Tc2 (H) = Tc (H) at various fields (the superconducting transition remains second order\neven in the presence of the field) and we derived (dHc2 /dT ) for H \u2192 0 around 800 Oe/K. In the vicinity of Tc (H) the\nrounding of the transition due to critical fluctuations [3] originates an almost exponential temperature dependence\nfor m. Because of the broadened transition region, and possibly of the powder character of the sample, the zero field\ntransition temperature can be estimated only with a rather large uncertainty: Tc = Tc (0) = 39.07 \u00b1 0.04 K.\nNow we are going to present and analyze the isothermal magnetization curves (Fig. 2). The departure from the\nPrange law [2], Mfl (T = Tc ) \u221d H 1/2 and Mfl (T \u226b Tc ) \u221d H, valid in the limit H \u2192 0, is evident. The upturn field\nHup (T ), as well as the maximum negative value reached by Mfl at Hup , are functions of temperature. Let us first give\na simple qualitative justification of these experimental findings, based on the assumption that the fluctuation-induced\nevanescent SC droplets are spherical, with a diameter of the order of the coherence length \u03be(T ). It is noted that those\ndroplets are the ones actually yielding the most effective diamagnetic screening [3].\nFor the droplets of radius d \u226a \u03be(T ) the zero dimensional approximation can be used. In this case the order\nparameter is no longer spatial dependent and for the magnetization an exact solution in the framework of the GL\nfunctional, valid for all fields H \u226a Hc2 (0) can be found [7]\nMflD=0 = \u2212kB T\n\n2\u03c0 2 \u03be(0)2 d2 /5\u03a620\n*H\n(\u03b5 + \u03c0 2 \u03be(0)2 H 2 d2 /5\u03a620 )\n\n(1)\n\nNow extending this result for d \u223c \u03be(T ) the upturn field turns out Hup = \u03b5\u03a60 /\u03be(0)2 , with \u03b5 = [(T \u2212 Tc (0))/Tc (0)]\nwhile the magnetization at Hup decreases on increasing temperature approximately as Mfl (Hup ) \u221d \u03b5\u22121 . The data in\nFig. 2 are qualitatively accounted for by the above considerations.\nIn Fig. 3 the value of the scaled magnetization m = \u2212Mfl(T )/H 1/2 T is reported as a function of the magnetic\nfield. It is noted that mc = m(T = Tc ) decays with the field and reaches half of the value mc (H \u2192 0) at about\nHs = 100 Oe. For temperature far from Tc (0) and small field, the magnetization tends to the linear increase with\nH and then m \u221d H 1/2 . For larger H the departure from the behaviour expected in the framework of Gaussian GL\ntheories in finite fields is dramatic. It can be observed that the field dependence of the FD in MgB2 is similar to the\none expected according to theories taking into account short wave length fluctuations and non local electrodynamic\neffects, as detected in conventional BCS superconductors [2].\nThus we first discuss the experimental findings on the basis of the fluctuation part of the Gibbs free energy of an\nanisotropic superconductor [4]\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 1\nV kB T h3/2\nH\n\u03b5\nG(\u03b5, h) = 1/2 3 \u03b6 \u2212 , +\n,\nh=\n,\n(2)\n2 2 2h\nHc2 (0)\n2 \u03c0\u03be (0)\n2\nwhere \u03be(0) = [\u03beab\n(0)\u03bec (0)]1/3 here is the geometrical average of the three components of the coherence length and\nHc2 (0) is angular dependent.

According to the\nabove equations and to scaling arguments [8\u201310], one has\nkB\nkB\nMfl (Tc )\n= 3/2 * mD (\u221e) = 3/2 * (\u22120.324) * \u03b3\nmc = \u221a\nH * Tc\n\u03a60\n\u03a60\n\n(10)\n\nwhere for anisotropic superconductors the field should be along the c-axis (cf. Ref. 4, 5).\nFrom the data for m reported in Fig. 1 one sees that the results obtained in MgB2 are consistent with a spectrum\nof SF with a strong enhancement factor. For a quantitative estimate, also in view of the uncertainty in the transition\ntemperature, we preferred to compare the value of mc with the one in grain-oriented YBCO placed in magnetic field\nalong the c-axis. It turns out that the absolute value of the scaled magnetization is slightly field dependent also in\nYBCO, where the crossing of m(T ) for different fields at Tc (0) seems to be well verified [9] for H\u223c> 1000 Oe. While our\ndata coincide with the one in Ref. [9] for H=1000 Oe, a significative increase of m appear when the field is reduced\nto 3 Oe. By using our data in small field and comparing the results for m at Tc (0) in powdered MgB2 and in YBCO,\nwhere \u03b3 \u2243 7, in the light of Eq. (6) and (7) one deduces an anisotropic factor of the same order in both cases. It\nshould be remarked that the anisotropy degree of MgB2 is still uncertain, with reports giving values unexpectedly\nlarge particularly for powders, ranging from 5 to 9 [11].\nIn summary, by means of SQUID magnetization measurements we have experimentally detected the fluctuating\ndiamagnetism and the magnetization curves above Tc in MgB2 . The data have been first analyzed in terms of the\ntheory for powdered anisotropic superconductor within the Gaussian approximation of the GL scenario. It has been\nfound that only in the limit of evanescent field the theory is obeyed, while for H\u223c> 100 Oe the field tends to suppress\nthe fluctuating pairs and the behavior of Mfl is similar to the one observed in conventional BCS superconductor and\nattributed to short wavelengths fluctuations and non local effects. The absolute value of the magnetization at Tc\nindicates that the spectrum of fluctuations in MgB2 is clearly anisotropic, to an extent close to the one in optimally\ndoped YBCO.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nUseful discussions with R.
