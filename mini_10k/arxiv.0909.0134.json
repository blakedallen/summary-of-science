One of the most interesting problems is a verification of extra\ndimensions by physical phenomena related to the higher-dimensional black holes. Higherdimensional black holes in accelerators [2, 3, 4] and in cosmic ray [5, 6, 7, 8] and gravitational\nwaves from higher-dimensional black holes [9] are studied for this purpose.\nIn astrophysics, the study of the classical tests of the general relativity: the light deflection, the perihelion shift, the time delay, could provide methods to know properties of\nthe spacetime metrics around compact objects. In addition, the precession of a gyroscope\n[10, 11, 12] is another experimental way to reveal the spacetime structure. The studies of\nthese effects open the possibility of testing higher-dimensional models by using astronomical\nand astrophysical observations at the solar system scale. Indeed, such problems are considered by using five-dimensional two-parameter family of Kaluza-Klein type solutions with\nan S2 symmetry [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18], and S2 symmetric solutions in brane world models\n[19, 20, 21, 22].\nNote that the exterior spacetime is described by the Schwarzschild metric for standard\ngeneral relativistic spherical compact objects. However, in higher-dimensional spacetime\nmodels, the exterior metric of a static star is no longer the Schwarzschild metric. In this\npaper, we consider another class of Kaluza-Klein type metrics which would describe exterior\nof compact objects. In the higher-dimensional spacetimes, even if we impose the asymptotic\nflatness to the four-dimensional part of the spacetime, there are various possibilities of\nfiber bundle structures of the extra dimensions as the fiber over the four-dimensional base\nspacetime. The black hole solutions with non-trivial bundle structures have been studied by\nvarious authors. Dobiasch and Maison found the first five-dimensional vacuum Kaluza-Klein\nblack hole solution which asymptotes to a twisted S1 fiber bundle over the four-dimensional\nMinkowski spacetime [23], and Gibbons and Wiltshire clarified the meaning of the metric\n[24]. Later, the solution was generalized to the rotating case [25], and charged case in\nthe five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory [26]. It is shown that this family of black\nholes have squashed S3 horizons, and that the metrics behave as fully five-dimensional black\n2\n\n\fholes in the vicinity of horizon, while behave as four-dimensional black holes in the far\nregion. The squashed Kaluza-Klein black hole solutions of cohomogeneity-one are related\nto asymptotically flat black hole solutions by a squashing function [26, 27]. Some of the\nsupersymmetric black hole solutions [28, 29, 30] in the framework of ref. [31] and nonsupersymmetric solutions [32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37] were constructed by the procedure of\nsquashing. These solutions also have been generalized in various directions, e.g., in EinsteinYang-Mills theory [38], and in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory [39, 40].\nMotivated by the Gravity Probe B experiment [12], we focus our attention to the precession of a gyroscope in an orbit around the Earth. We assume that the geometry of the region\noutside the Earth is described by the five-dimensional vacuum static squashed Kaluza-Klein\nblack hole metric [23, 26]. We derive the higher-dimensional correction of the precession\nangle to the general relativity, which is related with the size of the extra dimension.\nWe regard a rotating axis of the gyroscope carried by a satellite as a spacelike spin-vector.\nWhile the satellite moves along the stable circular orbit around the Earth, the spin-vector is\nparallely transported along this timelike circular geodesic. When the satellite returns to the\ninitial position, an angular difference of the final spin-vector from the initial one appears.\nThis is the geodetic effect [10]. Since the Earth rotates, the spin-vector is dragged around\nthe rotation axis of the Earth by the Kerr geometry [11]. The frame dragging effect by the\nKerr rotation is quite smaller than the geodetic effect, then, we investigate the correction\nby the extra dimensions to the geodetic effect in this paper.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we review the properties of fivedimensional static squashed Kaluza-Klein black hole solution. In section III, we show that\nthe five-dimensional squashed Kaluza-Klein black hole spacetime admits stable circular orbits similar to the four-dimensional Schwarzschild black holes. In section IV, we consider the\nparallel transportation of a spin-vector along a circular orbit in the squashed Kaluza-Klein\nblack hole spacetime, then derive the geodetic precession angle with the higher-dimensional\ncorrection. Finally, we devote section V to discussion.\n\nII.\n\nREVIEW OF SQUASHED KALUZA-KLEIN BLACK HOLES\n\nWe start from the five-dimensional vacuum Einstein equation,\nR\u03bc\u03bd = 0.\n3\n\n(1)\n\n\fThe static Kaluza-Klein black hole with a squashed S3 horizon [23, 24] is one of the exact\nsolutions of (1). The metric is written as [26]\n\u0014 2\n\u0015\nd\u03c1\nr2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nds = \u2212V (\u03c1)dt + U(\u03c1)\n+ \u03c1 d\u03a9S 2 + \u221e (d\u03c8 + cos \u03b8d\u03c6)2 ,\nV (\u03c1)\n4U(\u03c1)\nd\u03a92S 2 := d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ,\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nwhere the functions V (\u03c1), U(\u03c1) are given by\nV (\u03c1) = 1 \u2212\n\n\u03c1g\n,\n\u03c1\n\nU(\u03c1) = 1 +\n\n\u03c10\n,\n\u03c1\n\n(4)\n\n2\nand positive parameters r\u221e , \u03c1g and \u03c10 are related as r\u221e\n= 4\u03c10 (\u03c1g + \u03c10 ). The ranges of\n\ncoordinates are \u2212\u221e < t < \u221e, 0 < \u03c1 < \u221e, 0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c0, 0 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 2\u03c0, and 0 \u2264 \u03c8 \u2264 4\u03c0.\nThe black hole horizon is located at \u03c1 = \u03c1g , and the curvature singularity at \u03c1 = 0 is\nconcealed behind it. The induced metric on the three-dimensional cross section of the black\nhole horizon with a time slice t = const. is obtained as\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0014\u0012\n\u03c1g\n2\n2\n2\nd\u03a9S 2 + (d\u03c8 + cos \u03b8d\u03c6) .\nds \u03c1=\u03c1g , t=const. = \u03c1g \u03c10 1 +\n\u03c10\n\n(5)\n\nThen, we see that the metric of black hole horizon is the squashed S3 in the form of the\nHopf bundle. Since \u03c1g > 0 and \u03c10 > 0, we see that the radius of the S2 base is larger than\nthat of the S1 fiber.\nAt the infinity, \u03c1 = \u221e, the metric (2) behaves as\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\nds \u2243 \u2212dt + d\u03c1 + \u03c1\n\nd\u03a92S 2\n\n2\nr\u221e\n+\n(d\u03c8 + cos \u03b8d\u03c6)2 .\n4\n\n(6)\n\nThat is, the metric (2) asymptotes to a twisted constant S1 fiber bundle over the fourdimensional Minkowski spacetime. The size of compactified extra dimension of the spacetime\n(2) at the infinity is given by r\u221e . The Komar mass1 of this black hole (2) is given by\nM=\n\n\u03c1g\n\u03c0r\u221e \u03c1g\n=\n,\nG5\n2G4\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the five-dimensional gravitational constant G5 and the four-dimensional one G4 are\nrelated as\nG4 =\n1\n\nG5\n.\n2\u03c0r\u221e\n\n(8)\n\nFor the squashed black hole, the Komar mass takes a different value of the Abbott-Deser mass [41, 42].\n\n4\n\n\fHere, we discuss the physical meanings of the parameter \u03c10 in (2). If \u03c10 \u226a \u03c1g , \u03c1 dependence of the function V (\u03c1) is important but the function U(\u03c1) is almost unity for an\nobserver outside the horizon, \u03c10 \u226a \u03c1g . \u03c1. Then, the observer feels the spacetime as the\n\nfour-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole with a constant twisted S1 fiber with the metric\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\n\u03c1g\n\u03c1g\nr2\n2\n2\nds \u2243 \u2212 1 \u2212\ndt + 1 \u2212\nd\u03c12 + \u03c12 d\u03a92S 2 + \u221e (d\u03c8 + cos \u03b8d\u03c6)2 .\n(9)\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n4\nOn the other hand, if \u03c1g \u226a \u03c10 , the function U(\u03c1) becomes important for an observer at\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03c1g . \u03c1 \u226a \u03c10 . With the help of a new coordinate r = 2 \u03c10 \u03c1 and a parameter rg = 2 \u03c10 \u03c1g ,\n2\nsince rg2 \u226a r\u221e\n, the metric (2) approaches to the five-dimensional Schwarzschild-Tangherlini\n\nblack hole [43]:\n2\n\nds \u2243\n\nds2ST\n\nrg2\n=\u2212 1\u2212 2\nr\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\nrg2\ndt + 1 \u2212 2\ndr 2 + r 2 d\u03a92S 3 ,\nr\n2\n\n(10)\n\nwhere d\u03a92S 3 denotes the metric of the unit three-sphere. Then, the observer feels the spacetime as an almost S 3 symmetric black hole. Therefore, the parameter \u03c10 gives the typical\nscale of transition from five-dimension to effective four-dimension.\n\nIII.\n\nCIRCULAR ORBITS AROUND SQUASHED KALUZA-KLEIN BLACK\n\nHOLES\n\nWe consider timelike geodesics in the five-dimensional squashed Kaluza-Klein black hole.\nThe Lagrangian for a test particle in the metric (2) is\n\u0014\n\u0010\n\u0011 r2 \u0010\n\u00112 \u0015\nU 2\n1\n\u221e\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u2212V \u1e6b + \u03c1\u0307 + U\u03c1 \u03b8\u0307 + sin \u03b8\u03c6\u0307 +\n\u03c8\u0307 + cos \u03b8\u03c6\u0307\n,\nL=\n2\nV\n4U\n\n(11)\n\nwhere the overdot denotes the differentiation with respect to the proper time \u03c4 , then we set\nthe condition 2L = \u22121. We can obtain three constants of motion,\nE := V \u1e6b,\n\n(12)\n\n\u0011\n2\nr\u221e\ncos \u03b8 \u0010\n2\n2\n\u03c8\u0307 + cos \u03b8\u03c6\u0307 ,\nL := U\u03c1 sin \u03b8\u03c6\u0307 +\n4U\n\u0011\nr2 \u0010\np\u03c8 := \u221e \u03c8\u0307 + cos \u03b8\u03c6\u0307 .\n4U\n\n(13)\n(14)\n\nHere, we assume that the particle has no momentum in the extra direction, i.e., p\u03c8 = 0.\nThe effective Lagrangian for the particle is\n\u0014\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0015\nU 2\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u2212V \u1e6b + \u03c1\u0307 + U\u03c1 \u03b8\u0307 + sin \u03b8\u03c6\u0307\n,\nLeff =\n2\nV\n5\n\n(15)\n\n\fwhere 2Leff = \u22121. We see that this effective Lagrangian has the same form in the case\nof four-dimensional spherically symmetric spacetimes. Then, we can concentrate on orbits\nwith \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 on the assumption of p\u03c8 = 0. In these conditions, we obtain the energy\nconservation equation\n\u0012\n\n\u03c10\n1+\n\u03c1\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\nd\u03c1\nd\u03c4\n\n\u00132\n\n+ VKK (\u03c1) = E 2 ,\n\nwhere the effective potential is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c1g\nL2\nVKK (\u03c1) = 1 \u2212\n1+\n.\n\u03c1\n\u03c1 (\u03c1 + \u03c10 )\n\n(16)\n\n(17)\n\nWe note that (16) with (17) reduces to the energy conservation equation of a particle in the\nfour-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole spacetime in the limit \u03c10 \u2192 0. A typical shape\nof the effective potential VKK is shown in the left panel of Figure 1. We see that there is a\nstable circular orbit at the local minimum of the effective potential.\nThe squashed Kaluza-Klein black holes, which have stable circular orbits, make remarkable contrast with the higher-dimensional asymptotically flat black holes, which have no\nstable bound state of particles. For the simplest example, we consider timelike geodesics in\nthe five-dimensional Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole spacetime with the metric (10).\nWe consider motions in an equatorial plane, that is, \u03b8 = \u03c0/2, then we have the energy\nconservation equation\n\u0012\n\ndr\nd\u03c4\n\n\u00132\n\n2\n+ VST (r) = EST\n,\n\n(18)\n\nwith the effective potential\nVST (r) =\n\n\u0012\n\nrg2\n1\u2212 2\nr\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\nL2ST\n1+ 2 ,\nr\n\n(19)\n\nwhere EST and LST are constants of motion of the system [44]. A typical shape of the\neffective potential is drawn in the right panel of Figure 1. Clearly, there is no stable circular\norbit. The metric of squashed Kaluza-Klein black hole (2) with a condition \u03c10 \u226a \u03c1g can be a\ncandidate for the metric which describes a spacetime around the Earth where a test particle\ncan travel along a circular orbit. We can expect the appearance of the higher-dimensional\ncorrection, which is related to the parameter \u03c10 , to the geodetic precession effect of fourdimensional relativity.\n6\n\n\fVKK\n1.00\n\nVST\n1.6\n1.5\n\n0.98\n\n1.4\n0.96\n\n1.3\n1.2\n\n0.94\n\n1.1\n0.92\n1.0\nr\n\n\u03a1\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n0\n\n\u03a1g\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nrg\n\nFIG. 1: Effective potentials for a massive test particle moving in the five-dimensional squashed\nKaluza-Klein black hole metric (left).

We have assumed that the five-dimensional squashed KaluzaKlein black hole solution describes the geometry around the compact object. We have solved\nthe parallel transporting equation of a spin-vector along the circular timelike geodesic in\nthe squashed Kaluza-Klein black hole spacetime, and derived the geodetic precession angle\nwith the higher-dimensional correction. We have shown that the correction to the general\nrelativity is in proportion to the square of (size of extra dimension)/(gravitational radius of\ncentral object). If the size of extra dimension is order of 0.1 mm, the correction is order of\n10\u22125 for the Earth.\nIn the four-dimensional general relativity, the gravitational field in vacuum with spherical symmetry is uniquely described by the Schwarzschild metric. However, in the higherdimensional spacetime with Kaluza-Klein structure, even if we impose an asymptotic flatness\nin four-dimensional section, the metric is not determined uniquely. For example, the direct\nproduct of four-dimensional Schwarzschild spacetime with a small S1 is a possible metric to\ndescribe the geometry around the Earth. In this case, no higher-dimensional correction appears without a momentum of gyroscope in the extra direction. In contrast, it is interesting\nthat the correction exists even if the gyroscope moves along four-dimensional spacetime in\nthe squashed Kaluza-Klein geometry. If a precise experiment of gyroscope precession in the\nEarth orbit agrees the expected value of general relativity, it requires a rigorous upper limit\nof the size of extra dimension, or it excludes the squashed Kaluza-Klein metric for describing\nthe geometry around the Earth.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank M.
