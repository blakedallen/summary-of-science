Early attempts to answer this question focused on the evolution of the angle \u03b1\nbetween the star's rotation and magnetic axes, which can be measured from pulsar polarization\nswings. Davis & Goldstein (1970) showed that \u03b1 tends towards zero on the braking time-scale\nif the star is a rigid sphere or a fluid body in hydrostatic equilibrium - an unrealistic scenario\nwhich leaves all except the youngest pulsars as aligned rotators, contrary to observation. Goldreich\n(1970) observed that the crystalline crust of a neutron star supports shear stresses, thereby\npreventing a fraction of the hydrostatic bulge from aligning with the instantaneous rotation axis\nand establishing non-hydrostatic differences between the principal moments of inertia. In the\nabsence of internal friction, such a triaxial star precesses about its principal axis with a period\nthat is short compared to the braking time-scale, and the (fixed) angle between the principal\naxis and magnetic axis determines whether the precession amplitude (related to \u03b1) increases or\ndecreases under the action of the braking torque (Goldreich 1970).\nIn reality, a neutron star is not internally frictionless. Elastic strain energy is dissipated in\nthe crust as the non-hydrostatic deformation discussed above migrates around the star while it\nprecesses (Goldreich 1970; Chau & Henriksen 1971; Macy 1974). There is also dissipation due to\nimperfect coupling between the differentially rotating crust and superfluid core (Shaham 1977;\nAlpar & \u00d6gelman 1987; Link, Epstein & Baym 1993; Sedrakian, Wasserman & Cordes 1998). Both\ntypes of friction damp any precession that is initially present on a time-scale that is, theoretically,\nmuch shorter than the precession period - a plausible explanation for why the pulse profiles and\npolarization characteristics of young pulsars do not change secularly over several years as one\nexpects if the precession is undamped. The only isolated neutron star unambiguously known to\nprecess is PSR B1913+16 (Weisberg, Romani & Taylor 1989), where general relativistic effects\nare responsible. Tentative reports also exist of oscillatory variations in Crab and Vela timing\nresiduals (e.g. Lyne, Pritchard & Smith 1988; McCulloch et al. 1990; \u010cade\u017e, Gali\u010di\u010d & Calvani\n1997), and some authors have inferred changes in \u03b1 on the braking time-scale from braking-index\nmeasurements (Allen & Horvath 1997; Link & Epstein 1997) and the evolution of pulsar radio\nbeam statistics (Tauris & Manchester 1998).\nThe radiation torque acting on the neutron star has been treated in an incomplete fashion in\nall of the above work. The torque has two components: the familiar braking torque, responsible\nfor the secular spin-down of the star, and a component associated with the inertia of the near-zone\nradiation fields, sometimes misleadingly termed the 'anomalous torque' (Good & Ng 1985), whose\neffect is to make a spherical star precess about its magnetic axis. In all analyses to date, either\nthe total radiation torque has been set to zero, in order to study free precession (Macy 1974;\nShaham 1977; Alpar & \u00d6gelman 1987), or else the near-field component has been neglected, in the\nbelief that it exerts no significant influence on the rotation (Davis & Goldstein 1970; Goldreich\n1970; Chau & Henriksen 1971; Sedrakian et al. 1998). A careful study of both torque components\nin the context of a spherical star was carried out by Good & Ng (1985) for a magnetic dipole,\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\na magnetic quadrupole, and a hypothetical distribution of magnetospheric currents. Casini &\nMontemayor (1998) recently explored some effects of the near-field torque on a composite body\nwith a spherically symmetric crust coupled to a spherical core (cf. de Campli 1980).\nIn this paper, we demonstrate that the near-field component of the radiation torque strongly\ninfluences the rotation of an internally frictionless neutron star. In Section 2, we derive and solve\nEuler's equations of motion for a rigid, triaxial magnet and show that the regular precession\nrelative to the principal axes of inertia couples to the near-field torque, causing the star to wobble\nanharmonically. Certain potentially observable properties of the wobble are explored in Section\n3, including its period and amplitude and the slow evolution of \u03b1 and the angular frequency\nderivative \u03c9\u0307. The results are applied to pulsar timing and polarization observations, and to the\ninternal structure of young neutron stars, in Section 4.\n\n2.\n\nROTATION OF A RIGID, TRIAXIAL NEUTRON STAR\n\nIn this section, the rotation of a rigid, triaxial body with an embedded magnetic dipole\nis treated analytically. Euler's equations of motion are written down in Section 2.1. Two key\nelements of the motion - the torque-driven radiative precession, and the inertial free precession\n- are discussed in Sections 2.2 and 2.3 respectively and their time-scales are identified. Euler's\nequations are then solved approximately in Section 2.4 by a time-averaging technique for the\nspecial case of a biaxial star. The similarities and differences between this treatment and previous\nwork are noted in Section 2.5.\n\n2.1.\n\nEuler's Equations\n\nConsider a rigid, triaxial star with principal axes e1 , e2 and e3 , corresponding principal\nmoments of inertia I1 , I2 and I3 , ellipticities \u01eb = (I3 \u2212 I1 )/I1 and \u01eb\u2032 = (I2 \u2212 I1 )/I1 , and average\nradius r0 . We assume that the stellar magnetic field is dipolar and fixed in the star, and we restrict\nthe magnetic axis m to lie in the plane spanned by e1 and e3 , at an angle \u03c7 to e3 ; this entails a\nslight loss of generality. We also assume that the star is internally frictionless and that it rotates in\nvacuo, so that it is unaffected by magnetospheric currents; refer to Goldreich (1970) and Melatos\n(1997) for justifications of the latter assumption. It is important to keep in mind that, although\nwe idealize the star as a rigid body for simplicity, in reality the ellipsoid of inertia is determined\nby an equilibrium between elastic and hydromagnetic forces, as discussed in Section 2.3.\nIn Appendix A, we evaluate the radiation torque acting on the star from the electromagnetic\nfields generated by a magnetized, conducting sphere rotating in vacuo (Deutsch 1955; Melatos\n1997); it is assumed that the star's triaxiality can be neglected when calculating the fields and\ntorque.

The familiar braking torque, which is responsible for the secular\nspin-down of the star, is associated with terms proportional to F (x0 ), whereas the near-field\ntorque discussed in Section 1 is associated with terms proportional to G(x0 ). In most applications,\nr0 is taken to be the stellar radius R (cf. Section 3.6 and Kaburaki 1981, Melatos 1997), yielding\nx0 \u226a 1, F (x0 ) = 1/3 and G(x0 ) = 3/10x0 . The near-field torque is therefore much greater than\nthe braking torque in this regime and acts on a commensurately shorter time-scale. Equations (4)\nand (5) differ from the expressions F (x0 ) = 1/3 and G(x0 ) = 1/2x0 found in previous works (Davis\n& Goldstein 1970; Goldreich 1970), partly because the treatment in this paper is not restricted to\nx0 \u226a 1, and partly because we model the star's internal magnetization in a slightly different way,\nas explained in Appendix A.\n\n2.2.\n\nRadiative Precession\n\nThe near-field component of the radiation torque causes the star to precess and nutate about\nits magnetic axis. We call this motion 'radiative precession'. To understand its origin, consider the\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nsimple special case of a spherical star (\u01eb = \u01eb\u2032 = 0). In the regime x0 \u226a 1, where the form factor\nuG(x0 ) \u2248 3c/10r0 \u03c90 is independent of s, Euler's equations (1) to (3) have the exact solution (cf.\nDavis & Goldstein 1970)\nu1 = u1,0 u3,0\n\n(\n\n2u23,0 F (x0 )s\n\u2212 u21,0\nexp\n\u03c9 0 \u03c40\n\n)\u22121/2\n\ncos\n\nu3,0 uG(x0 )s\n,\n\u03c9 0 \u03c40\n\n(7)\n\nu2 = u1,0 u3,0\n\n(\n\n2u23,0 F (x0 )s\nexp\n\u2212 u21,0\n\u03c9 0 \u03c40\n\n)\u22121/2\n\nu3,0 uG(x0 )s\nsin\n,\n\u03c9 0 \u03c40\n\n(8)\n\n#\n\n\"\n\n\"\n\n#\n\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\nu3 = u3,0 ,\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0015\n\n(9)\n\nfor the initial conditions u1 = u1,0 , u2 = 0, u3 = u3,0 6= 0 at s = 0.4 A spherical star therefore\nprecesses harmonically about m with period\n\u03c41 =\n\n20\u03c0r0 \u03c90\n3u3,0 c\n\n!\n\n\u03c40 \u226a \u03c40 ,\n\n(10)\n\nand the precession amplitude decays exponentially on the time-scale 3\u03c40 /u23,0 , as \u03c9 aligns with m.\nTaking r0 = R = 10 km (cf.

The effect depends\nonly on the radiation fields outside the star, which in turn are determined completely by the\nmagnetic field at the stellar surface and the property that the star is a good conductor (Deutsch\n1955). The magnetic field inside the star does not influence the radiative precession.\nThe near-field torque contributes terms proportional to u2 u3 and u1 u3 in (1) and (2)\nrespectively and therefore adds to, or subtracts from, similar terms arising from material\ndistortions (i.e. \u01eb and \u01eb\u2032 ). Thus a biaxial star (\u01eb\u2032 = 0) with \u03c7 = 0 and \u01eb = \u01ebrad does not precess at\nall, because the terms (\u01eb\u2032 \u2212 \u01eb)u2 u3 and \u01ebu1 u3 are cancelled out exactly by the near-field torque.\n4\n\nSee Davis & Goldstein (1970) for a discussion of the singular special case u3,0 = 0.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n2.3.\n\nFree Precession\n\nIn the absence of the radiation torque, a triaxial neutron star precesses relative to its principal\naxes of inertia on a time-scale \u03c42 = 2\u03c0/\u01eb\u03c9, where \u01eb is the non-hydrostatic ellipticity. A variety of\nnon-hydrostatic mechanisms, many with geological analogues (Lambeck 1980), combine to deform\nthe stellar mass distribution. We concentrate on elastic and magnetic deformations in this paper.\nThe crystalline stellar crust supports shear stresses which prevent a fraction of the hydrostatic\nbulge from aligning with the instantaneous rotation axis. For a crust with uniform shear modulus\n\u03bc, one finds \u01ebcr = 5\u03bc\u0303\u03c9 2 R3 /4(1 + \u03bc\u0303)GM , with \u03bc\u0303 = 38\u03c0\u03bcR4 /3GM 2 , where M is the mass of the\nstar (Goldreich 1970; Lambeck 1980, p. 42). This elastic deformation yields a precession period\n\u03c42cr\n\n14\n\n= 1 \u00d7 10\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bc\n1028 N m\u22122\n\n\u0013\u22121 \u0012\n\n\u03c9\n1 rad s\u22121\n\n\u0013\u22123\n\ns\n\n(13)\n\n\u22124\nfor neutron star parameters. If the crust is structured as a Coulomb lattice, one has \u03bc\u0303 <\n\u223c 10 and\nthe non-hydrostatic fraction of the bulge is small; however, the exact value of \u03bc\u0303 is uncertain and\nmay be much less than this upper bound.\n\nThe magnetic field inside the star creates an additional deformation because non-radial\nfield gradients (e.g. between the poles and equator if the field is a dipole) support non-radial\nmatter-density gradients in hydromagnetic equilibrium. (This is not related in any way to the\nelectromagnetic inertia of the external radiation fields discussed in Section 2.2.) The geometry\nand magnitude of the deformation is difficult to estimate, because little is known about the\nstructure of the internal magnetic field. Thompson & Duncan (1993) argued that, if the internal\nfield is generated after collapse in a convective dynamo, then it must be organized into randomly\noriented loops \u223c 1 km in size, each with field strength \u223c 1011 T; the neutron star rotates too slowly\n(Rossby number Ro >\n\u223c 10) to establish a coherent toroidal field at the base of the convection\nzone (cf. the Solar dynamo). On the other hand, if the internal field is generated before collapse\nin the progenitor star (e.g. in the convective outer envelope or hydrogen-burning core), a large\ntoroidal field can grow (Ro <\n\u223c 0.1). Blandford, Applegate & Hernquist (1983) examined toroidal\nfield generation by a thermoelectric dynamo. Several authors have raised the possibility of a very\n10\nstrong internal field (>\n\u223c 10 T \u226b B0 ) in diverse contexts, including off-centred-dipole theories of\nthe pulsar death line (Arons 1998), thermally regulated resurrection of a buried field (Muslimov &\nPage 1996), Ohmic decay in an anisotropically conducting core (Haensel, Urpin & Yakovlev 1990),\ncrust-core coupling in Vela glitches (Abney, Epstein & Olinto 1996; cf. Easson 1979), and the effect\nof a virial field (1014 T) on modified Urca cooling (Yuan & Zhang 1998) and the quark-hadron\nequation of state (Pal, Bandyopadhyay & Chakrabarty 1998).\nAssuming that the internal magnetic field is at least as strong as the surface field and roughly\nrad 2 2\ndipolar, we find that the hydromagnetic deformation satisfies \u01ebmag >\n\u223c \u01eb c /cs , where cs is the\nisothermal sound speed (= 3\u22121/2 c in a relativistic star); in other words, \u01ebmag exceeds \u01ebrad at least\nby a factor of order the ratio of the stellar to Schwarzschild radii. This yields an upper bound on\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nthe precession period \u03c42mag associated with the hydromagnetic deformation given by\n\u03c42mag\n\n13\n\n\u2264 1 \u00d7 10\n\n\u0012\n\nB0\n108 T\n\n\u0013\u22122 \u0012\n\n\u03c9\n1 rad s\u22121\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\ns.\n\n(14)\n\nNote that the combined elasto-hydromagnetic deformation is triaxial in general. Biaxiality (\u01eb\u2032 = 0)\nis a good approximation only when one has \u01ebcr \u226a \u01ebmag (or else \u01ebcr \u226b \u01ebmag ) and the internal\nmagnetic field (or crust) is symmetric about a unique axis.\nEquations (11), (13) and (14) reveal that, as a rule, the periods of the radiative precession\nand free precession are comparable. One has \u03c41 \u223c \u03c42mag , if the internal and surface magnetic\nfields are of similar magnitude, and sometimes \u03c41 \u223c \u03c42cr as well, e.g. for a one-second pulsar with\n\u03bc = 1028 N m\u22122 and B0 = 4 \u00d7 108 T. In general, therefore, the 'free' precession is not free at\nall; rather, it couples to the near-field component of the radiation torque, and its character is\nmodified significantly as a result. This coupling has been overlooked in the literature on aspherical\nrotators to date (Goldreich 1970; Chau & Henriksen 1971; Macy 1974; Shaham 1977; Alpar &\n\u00d6gelman 1987; Sedrakian et al. 1998), and the remainder of this paper is devoted to exploring\nits consequences. It can only be neglected under certain circumstances, e.g. when the internal\nmagnetic field is strong and the free precession is therefore fast (\u03c42mag <\n\u223c 0.05\u03c41 ; see Section 3.2).\n\n2.4.\n\nSeparating the Braking and Precession Time-Scales: An Approximate Solution\nof Euler's Equations\n\nEuler's equations (1) to (3) can be solved approximately by averaging over the precession\nperiod, exploiting the fact that both \u03c41 and \u03c42 are small compared to \u03c40 (except in the regime\nx0 \u223c 1; see Section 3.6). The analysis parallels that by Goldreich (1970), with one crucial\ndifference: we account fully for the radiative precession in what follows, whereas Goldreich (1970)\nartificially suppressed it by averaging the braking torque and near-field torque over the free\nprecession period.\nLet us restrict attention to a biaxial star (\u01eb\u2032 = 0) for the sake of simplicity. When the 'slow'\nbraking terms in Euler's equations, proportional to (\u03c90 \u03c40 )\u22121 F (x0 ), are neglected relative to 'fast'\nterms, proportional to \u01eb and (\u03c90 \u03c40 )\u22121 uG(x0 ), the equations reduce to the zeroth-order system\nu\u03071 = \u01eb\u03b2 \u22121 u2 [u1 sin \u03c7 cos \u03c7 \u2212 (\u03b2 \u2212 cos2 \u03c7)u3 ],\n\n(15)\n\nu\u03072 = \u01eb\u03b2 \u22121 [(u23 \u2212 u21 ) sin \u03c7 cos \u03c7 + (\u03b2 \u2212 cos2 \u03c7 + sin2 \u03c7)u1 u3 ],\n\n(16)\n\nu\u03073 = \u2212\u01eb\u03b2\n\n\u22121\n\nu2 (u1 sin \u03c7 + u3 cos \u03c7) sin \u03c7,\n\nwith\n\u03b2=\n\n\u01eb\u03c90 \u03c40\n.\nuG(x0 )\n\n(17)\n\n(18)\n\nThe parameter \u03b2 is independent of s in the regime x0 \u226a 1 and is positive or negative according\nto whether the star is oblate or prolate. Upon multiplying (15), (16) and (17) by u1 , u2 and u3\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nrespectively, we find that\n\u03b7 = u21 + u22 + u23\n\n(19)\n\nis a constant of the motion; in other words, the total angular momentum of the star is unaffected\nby the near-field component of the radiation torque. Furthermore, dividing (15) by (17) yields a\nsecond constant of the motion\n\u03b3 = (u1 sin \u03c7 + u3 cos \u03c7)2 \u2212 \u03b2u23 ,\n\n(20)\n\nwhich loosely measures the difference between the precession and magnetic inclination angles.\nOne can solve (16), (19) and (20) simultaneously to obtain a first-order differential equation for\nu2 , solvable by quadrature, whose solution is exactly periodic but anharmonic in general. For the\nillustrative special case \u03c7 = 90\u25e6 , \u03b2 > 0 calculated in Appendix B, we find\nu1 =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b3 + \u03b7\u03b2\n\u03b2+1\n\n\u00131/2\n\nu2 =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b3 + \u03b7\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\n\u00131/2\n\nu3 =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b7\u2212\u03b3\n\u03b2+1\n\n\u00131/2\n\n\" \u0012\n\n\u00131/2\n\n\" \u0012\n\n\u00131/2\n\n\u03b7\u2212\u03b3\ncn \u01eb\n\u03b2\n\u03b7\u2212\u03b3\nsn \u01eb\n\u03b2\n\" \u0012\n\n\u03b7\u2212\u03b3\ndn \u01eb\n\u03b2\n\n\u00131/2\n\n#\n\n(21)\n\n#\n\n(22)\n\ns+\u03a6 ,\ns+\u03a6 ,\n#\n\ns+\u03a6 ,\n\n(23)\n\nwhere sn, cn and dn are Jacobian elliptic functions with modulus k2 = (\u03b3 + \u03b7\u03b2)/(\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b3)\u03b2. Note\nthat the phase \u03a6 of the oscillation is a third constant of the motion, related to u1 , u2 and u3 in a\ncomplicated way.\nWhen terms proportional to (\u03c90 \u03c40 )\u22121 F (x0 ) are restored to Euler's equations, the above\nsolutions remain approximately valid, but the constants of the motion are converted into slowly\nvarying functions of s, viz., \u03b7 = \u03b7(s), \u03b3 = \u03b3(s) and \u03a6 = \u03a6(s). The slow variation occurs on the\nbraking time-scale \u03c40 , which is long compared to \u03c41 \u223c \u03c42 \u223c \u01eb\u22121 . Analytic expressions for \u03b7\u0307, \u03b3\u0307 and\n\u03a6\u0307 are obtained by substituting (21), (22) and (23) into (1), (2) and (3) and averaging over \u03a6.\nResults for \u03c7 = 90\u25e6 are given for reference in Appendix B.\n\n2.5.\n\nComparison with Previous Work\n\nEquations (1) to (3) reduce to the equations solved by Davis & Goldstein (1970) for the\nspecial case of a spherical star (\u01eb = \u01eb\u2032 = 0, and hence \u03c7 = 0 without loss of generality), and to\nthose solved by Goldreich (1970) in the regime \u03c42 \u226a \u03c41 where the free precession is much faster\nthan the radiative precession. The latter regime corresponds to a large elasto-hydromagnetic\ndeformation, such as when the internal magnetic field is much stronger than the surface field (see\nSection 2.3), but it is not fully general. In contrast, the solutions presented in Section 2.4 and the\nnumerical results in Section 3 address the general problem where \u03c41 /\u03c42 is arbitrary, including the\nregime \u03c41 \u2248 \u03c42 where the free and radiative precessions couple together. Previous authors have\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\ndiscussed the physical origins of \u03c41 and \u03c42 (Goldreich 1970; Chau & Henriksen 1971; de Campli\n1980).\nOur analysis cannot be compared directly with previous work treating the star as anelastic\n(e.g. Macy 1974) or with models featuring a core and crust coupled together (Shaham 1977; de\nCampli 1980; Alpar & \u00d6gelman 1987; Casini & Montemayor 1998; Sedrakian et al. 1998).\n\n3.\n\nPROPERTIES OF THE ROTATION\n\nThe motion analyzed in Section 2 is characterized by several properties of potential\nobservational significance which we now investigate, including the precession period (Section 3.1)\nand amplitude (Section 3.2), the evolution of the magnetic inclination (Section 3.3), the different\nbehaviour of oblate and prolate stars (Section 3.4), the phenomenon of 'pseudo-glitches' in \u03c9\u0307\n(Section 3.5), and the effect of a corotating magnetosphere (Section 3.6). In what follows, we\nassume that the orientation of \u03c9 is arbitrary at the time when the neutron star first crystallizes\ninto an object with a rigid crust spinning down electromagnetically. In other words, u1,0 , u2,0\nand u3,0 are assumed to be comparable; we do not choose a privileged initial spin state where \u03c9\nis parallel to one of the principal axes. This assumption is important because in Section 4 we\npresent strong observational evidence that isolated pulsars evolve rapidly towards a stable state of\nthis sort, probably under the action of internal friction. Consequently, the properties investigated\nbelow characterize neutron stars early in their lives.\nThe results in this section are mainly presented in the context of a biaxial star (\u01eb\u2032 = 0) for\ntwo reasons. First, we find numerically that the rotation properties of biaxial and triaxial stars\nare qualitatively alike, except for pseudo-glitches (Section 3.5) which are an intrinsically triaxial\nphenomenon. Second, the aim of this section is to illustrate those aspects of the dynamics that are\nobservationally relevant; an exhaustive quantitative survey of the rotation of a triaxial magnet lies\noutside the scope of this paper. Formally speaking, however, biaxiality is a good approximation\nonly as long as one has \u01ebcr \u226a \u01ebmag (or else \u01ebcr \u226b \u01ebmag ) and the internal magnetic field (or crust) is\nsymmetric about a unique axis.\n\n3.1.\n\nPrecession Period\n\nThe period \u2206s of the anharmonic precession is typically \u223c |\u03b2|1/2 |\u01eb|\u22121 , in units of \u03c90\u22121 . For\nthe special case \u03c7 = 90\u25e6 , \u03b2 > 0, \u2206s is given exactly by\n4\n\u2206s =\n|\u01eb|\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b2\n\u03b7\u2212\u03b3\n\n\u00131/2\n\nK\n\n(\u0014\n\n\u03b3 + \u03b7\u03b2\n\u03b2(\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b3)\n\n\u00151/2 )\n\n,\n\n(24)\n\nwhere K(k), a complete elliptic integral of the first kind, increases logarithmically from K(0) = \u03c0/2\nto K(1) = \u221e. Note that the precession is not exactly periodic, because \u2206s \u221d (\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b3)\u22121/2 increases\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nadiabatically on the braking time-scale \u03c40 . Indeed, \u2206s increases significantly and approaches\n\u03c90 \u03c40 (so that the separation into slow and fast time-scales in Section 2.4 breaks down) under two\nspecial sets of circumstances: (i) at k = 1, where u1 , u2 and u3 suddenly swap oscillation modes\n('mode jumping'; see Section 3.4); and (ii) at the \u03b7 = \u03b3 resonance, where the the star rotates\nsteadily with u2 = u3 = 0 and u1 = const for \u03b2 > \u22121 (Section 3.4). If the star is triaxial, a second\nprecession time-scale, \u2206s \u223c |\u03b2|1/2 |\u01eb\u2032 |\u22121 , is introduced.\n\n3.2.\n\nPrecession and Nutation Amplitudes\n\nFigure 1 displays the precession angle \u03b8, defined to be the angle between \u03c9 and e3\n(cos \u03b8 = u3 /u), as a function of time. We see from Figure 1 that the star precesses (\u03b8 6= 0 on\naverage) and nutates (\u03b8 oscillates in a range \u03b81 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 \u03b82 during one precession period), and that\nthe slow evolution of the precession and nutation amplitudes is determined by \u03b2, \u03c7 and the initial\norientation of \u03c9 . In the regime \u03b2 \u226b 1 where the free precession period \u03c42 is shorter than both\ntorque-related time-scales \u03c40 and \u03c41 , the nutation amplitude is small and \u03b8 decreases exponentially\nto zero for \u03c7 = 20\u25e6 (thick band in Figure 1). This result, and a similar calculation for \u03c7 = 70\u25e6 (not\nshown), confirm Goldreich's (1970) conclusion that the slow evolution of \u03b8 in the regime \u03b2 \u226b 1\ndepends solely on \u03c7, with \u03b8 \u2192 0\u25e6 for \u03c7 < \u03c7cr = cos\u22121 (3\u22121/2 ) \u2248 55\u25e6 and \u03b8 \u2192 90\u25e6 for \u03c7 > \u03c7cr .\nGoldreich's (1970) conclusion is invalid when \u03c41 and \u03c42 are comparable. The solid and dotted\ncurves in Figure 1 both correspond to \u03c7 = 20\u25e6 < \u03c7cr , but with \u03b2 = 0.8 and hence \u03c41 \u223c \u03c42 . Neither\ncurve behaves as predicted by Goldreich (1970): either \u03b8 approaches a constant non-zero value\nwhile the nutation amplitude decreases to zero (solid curve), or else \u03b8 remains constant on average\nwith a peak-to-peak nutation amplitude of \u2248 50\u25e6 (dotted curve). In each case, the precession is\npersistent, and its character is determined by the initial orientation of \u03c9 .\n\n3.3.\n\nDo the Magnetic and Rotation Axes Align?\n\nThe magnetic inclination angle \u03b1 between \u03c9 and m is defined in terms of u1 , u2 and u3\nby u cos \u03b1 = u1 sin \u03c7 + u3 cos \u03c7. In Figure 2, we plot \u03b1 as a function of time for several choices\nof \u03b2 and \u03c7. For \u03c7 = 0\u25e6 , \u03b2 = 0.5, we see that \u03b1 decreases exponentially to zero on the braking\ntime-scale. By solving (1) to (3) analytically for \u03c7 = 0\u25e6 , one can show that \u03b1 approaches zero\nfor arbitrary \u03b2, implying that a star subject to a predominantly magnetic deformation ultimately\nbecomes an aligned rotator - a state in which it cannot be detected as a pulsar. An aligned final\nstate (\u03b1 = 180\u25e6 ) can also be attained by a star with \u03c7 6= 0\u25e6 (upper dotted curve in Figure 2).\nIn contrast, if the star nutates persistently as discussed in Section 3.2, \u03b1 mimics \u03b8 and oscillates\nwithin a range (typically tens of degrees).\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n3.4.\n\nOblate and Prolate Stars, and the \u03b7-\u03b3 Phase Plane\n\nAn instructive way to view the evolution of the rotation is to follow the star's trajectory\n[\u03b7(s), \u03b3(s)] on the \u03b7-\u03b3 phase plane. As shown in Section 2.4, \u03b7 and \u03b3 are approximately constant\nover one precession period, varying slowly on the braking time-scale \u03c40 . Figure 3 shows phase\ndiagrams for three stars with \u03c7 = 90\u25e6 and different ellipticities. Since \u03b7 and \u03b3 are not exactly\nconstant over one precession period, the trajectories are slightly irregular.\nFigure 3(a) shows that an oblate star (\u03b2 > 0) evolves asymptotically towards a state with\n\u03b3 = \u03b7 6= 0 and hence u2 = u3 = 0, u1 = const (see [19] and [20]); in other words, for \u03c7 = 90\u25e6 , an\noblate star always approaches steady-state rotation with \u03c9 parallel to m (= e1 ). Equations (1)\nto (3) imply that this is a singular fixed point which exists for \u03c7 = 90\u25e6 only. The evolution of a\nprolate star (\u03b2 < 0) depends on the relative magnitudes of the precession periods \u03c41 (radiative)\nand \u03c42 (free). When the radiative precession is faster (\u22121 < \u03b2 < 0), as in Figure 3(b), the star\nevolves to a state with \u03b3 = \u03b7 6= 0, as discussed above. When the free precession is faster (\u03b2 < \u22121),\nas in Figure 3(c), the star evolves to a state with \u03b3 = \u03b7 = 0, and \u03c9 does not necessarily align\nwith any preferred axis on the way, although it may do so for specific initial conditions. In all\nthe above cases, the phase-plane trajectories are confined within the triangular region 0 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 1,\nmin(\u2212\u03b7\u03b2, 0) \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 max(\u03b7, \u2212\u03b7\u03b2).\nHow are the phase diagrams modified for \u03c7 6= 90\u25e6 ? Firstly, the trajectories are confined to a\nsmaller (larger) triangular region for \u03b2 > 0 (\u03b2 < 0) defined by\n0 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 1,\n\nmin(0, \u03b31 , \u03b33 ) \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 max(\u03b31 , \u03b32 , \u03b33 ),\n\n(25)\n\nwith \u03b31 = \u03b7(cos2 \u03c7 \u2212 \u03b2), \u03b32 = \u03b7 sin2 \u03c7 and\n\u03b33 = \u03b7[sin2 (\u03c7 + \u03c8) \u2212 \u03b2 sin2 \u03c8],\n\ntan 2\u03c8 =\n\nsin 2\u03c7\n.\n\u03b2 \u2212 cos 2\u03c7\n\n(26)\n\nSecondly, although the \u03b2 > \u22121 trajectories approach the diagonal line \u03b3 = max(\u03b31 , \u03b32 , \u03b33 ), they\ndo not stop there like in Figure 3. Instead, they bend downwards to merge with the diagonal,\ntravelling down along it as \u03b7 decreases. This is because the state \u03b3 = max(\u03b31 , \u03b32 , \u03b33 ) is only a\nfixed point for \u03c7 = 90\u25e6 , as pointed out above.\nThe trajectories in Figures 3(a)\u2013(c) asymptotically approach, or travel exactly along, the\nlines \u03b3 = \u03b7 and \u03b3 = \u2212\u03b7\u03b2 except in the case \u22121 < \u03b2 < 0 (Figure 3[b]), where trajectories with\n\u03b3 < \u2212\u03b2 at s = 0 subsequently cross the line \u03b3 = \u2212\u03b7\u03b2. When this happens, a phenomenon we call\n'mode jumping' takes place. As shown in Figure 4, u1 and u2 interchange oscillation modes at\ns \u2248 2.7 \u03c90 \u03c40 , swapping between a wine-glass mode and a sinusoidal mode, while the u3 oscillation\nbecomes temporarily flatter-peaked.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n3.5.\n\nPseudo-Glitches in the Frequency Derivative of a Triaxial Star\n\nA triaxial ellipsoid of inertia arises naturally if, for example, the deformation is predominantly\nmagnetic with appreciable quadrupolar and off-centred components, or if one has \u01ebcr \u223c \u01ebmag .\nFigure 5 plots the angular frequency derivative u\u0307 as a function of time for a triaxial star with\n\u01eb\u2032 = 0.09\u01eb. We see that the smooth, braking-related decrease of |u\u0307| is punctuated by sudden,\nquasi-periodic spikes in which |u\u0307| changes by up to 90 per cent. We call these excursions\n'pseudo-glitches'. They resemble true glitches because (i) they recur quasi-periodically with period\n\u223c x0 \u03c40 (\u2248 10 yr for the Crab), and (ii) u\u0307 returns to its trend value after each excursion. However,\n\u221210\nthey are manifestly not true glitches because (i) their rise time is too long (cf. <\n\u223c 10 \u03c40 for Crab\nglitches), and (ii) they do not cause u itself to increase. Note that u\u0307 oscillates about the average\nspin-down trend even for \u01eb\u2032 = 0, but not in the spiky fashion of Figure 5.\nWhat is the physical origin of pseudo-glitches? The dotted curve in Figure 5 shows that\npseudo-glitches coincide with rapid changes in \u03b1, accompanied by mode jumping, which occur\nwhen the free precession is modulated on a fast time-scale (\u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb)\u03c42 which couples resonantly to the\nradiative precession (i.e. \u01eb\u03c41 \u2248 \u01eb\u2032 \u03c42 ). It turns out that the sharpness of the spikes is sensitive to \u01eb\u2032\nand uG(x0 ); for the example in Figure 5, the spikes are washed out once \u01eb\u2032 falls outside the range\n\u2032\n\u25e6\n0.05 <\n\u223c \u01eb /\u01eb <\n\u223c 0.15. Figure 5 shows the case \u03c7 = 40 . For larger \u03c7, the small bumps between the\nspikes increase in amplitude until they become spiky themselves. For smaller \u03c7, the bumps flatten\nuntil they disappear.\n\n3.6.\n\nCorotating Magnetosphere\n\nThe foregoing results pertain to the regime x0 \u226a 1, where r0 is taken to be the stellar\nradius R. However, recent work by Melatos (1997) suggests that the corotating magnetosphere\nof a neutron star acts as a perfectly conducting, rigid extension of the stellar interior out to\na characteristic radius rv where outflowing plasma is not constrained to flow along magnetic\nfield lines by cyclotron losses, and that it is therefore necessary to set r0 = rv when calculating\nelectromagnetic spin-down properties like pulsar braking indices. For young pulsars (e.g. the Crab,\nPSR B1509\u221258, PSR B0540\u221269), one finds rv <\n\u223c c/\u03c9, and hence x0 <\n\u223c 1.\nIn the regime x0 <\n\u223c 1, the radiative precession period satisfies \u03c41 \u223c \u03c40 , the near-field radiation\ntorque uncouples from the free precession, and the evolution of the precession amplitude is\ngoverned completely by \u03c7/\u03c7cr (Goldreich 1970). However, a pulsar born with x0 <\n\u223c 1 soon evolves\ntowards the regime x0 \u226a 1 as \u03c9 decreases. Therefore, unless the free precession amplitude\ndecreases to zero during the initial braking phase with x0 <\n\u223c 1 (not the outcome in general), the\nrotation behaves thereafter in the way described in Sections 3.1 to 3.5.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n4.\n\nAPPLICATION TO OBSERVATIONS\n\nTiming and polarization studies suggest that most, if not all, young pulsars do not precess in\nthe manner described in Sections 2 and 3. The implication is that isolated neutron stars born with\na large precessional motion approach stable spin states ( \u03c9 parallel to a principal axis of inertia)\nover times that are short compared to their current ages, probably due to internal friction. We\noutline the conditions for a neutron star to be born with a large precessional motion in Section\n4.1, summarize the status of observational searches for precession in Section 4.2, and discuss the\nobservational consequences of frictional stabilization in Section 4.3.\n\n4.1.\n\nPrecession at Birth\n\nWhen a neutron star is born, it spins about an axis \u03c9 0 dictated by conservation of angular\nmomentum (of the degenerate remnant and the ejecta) during the supernova explosion. There is\nno reason why \u03c9 0 should immediately be parallel to the principal axis of greatest non-hydrostatic\nmoment of inertia (the magnetic axis m, since the star is a fluid). Indeed, Thompson & Duncan\n(1993) argued that post-collapse convection destroys any correlation between \u03c9 0 and m.\nViscous dissipation in the fluid star forces \u03c9 0 to approach m over time. The dissipation rate\nis therefore critical in determining whether the star will exhibit a large initial precession when its\ncrust crystallizes. Unfortunately, the viscosity of a newly born neutron star is poorly constrained.\nCutler & Lindblom (1987) estimate the viscous damping time (e.g. for stellar oscillations) to be\nroughly 3 \u00d7 102 (\u03c1/1017 kg m\u22123 )\u22121.25 (T /109 K)2 yr, to be compared with a crust crystallization time\nof less than one year, but this estimate is known to be valid only in narrow ranges of density \u03c1\nand temperature T centred on the above fiducial values. In what follows, we make no assumption\nabout the viscous damping time and instead explore several possible scenarios.\nIf the viscosity is high enough, \u03c9 0 aligns with m first, before the crust crystallizes. Assuming\nthat the symmetry axis of the crust when it crystallizes is along \u03c9 0 (likely, though not certain),\nthen the principal axis e3 (from both elastic and magnetic contributions) is parallel to \u03c9 0 , and\nthere is no precession.\nIf the viscosity is low enough, the crust crystallizes first, before \u03c9 0 has time to align with m\n- the order of events implied by the viscosity estimates of Cutler & Lindblom (1987). In this\nscenario, two things can happen: (i) one has \u01ebcr \u226b \u01ebmag , and the symmetry axis of the crust when\nit crystallizes is along \u03c9 0 , so that e3 is parallel to \u03c9 0 and there is no precession; or (ii) one has\n\u01ebcr \u226a \u01ebmag , so that e3 is parallel to m - which is not parallel to \u03c9 0 at the epoch of crystallization\n- and there is a large precession. Below we explore the observational implications of scenario (ii).\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n4.2.\n\nChanges in Pulse Profile and Polarization\n\nThe results of Section 3 imply that a neutron star in an arbitrary initial spin state precesses\n(and nutates) with period \u223c x0 \u03c40 and a typical amplitude of tens of degrees, and that the motion\nis persistent in general. One therefore expects fractional changes of order unity in the pulse profile\n(e.g. relative height or separation of conal components), magnetic inclination angle \u03b1 (measured\nfrom polarization-swing data), and angular frequency derivative \u03c9\u0307 (measured by timing) over a\nsingle precession period. For young, Crab-like objects (x0 \u2248 10\u22122 , \u03c40 \u2248 103 yr), the fractional\nchanges amount to \u223c 10 per cent per year and ought to be readily observable; for old objects\n(x0 \u2248 10\u22123 , \u03c40 \u2248 106 yr), the changes amount to \u223c 0.1 per cent per year and are harder to detect.\nContrary to the above expectation, the only reliable detection of neutron-star precession to\ndate has been Weisberg et al.'s (1989) discovery of the general relativistic geodetic precession\nof PSR 1913+16. Six years of accurate measurements of the doubly-peaked radio pulse profile\nrevealed that the flux density in the first component is decreasing relative to the second by \u2248 1\nper cent per year, consistent with the line of sight moving across a spot of enhanced emissivity\nin the magnetosphere at the rate prescribed by geodetic precession. Weisberg et al.'s (1989)\nupper limit |\u2206w| < 0\u25e6 .06 on the six-year change in pulse width w implies a maximum precession\n\u25e6\n\u22121\namplitude <\n\u223c 0 .4 yr , consistent with a relativistic origin and much larger than the predicted\nradiative precession amplitude of \u2248 0\u25e6 .001 yr\u22121 . Hence PSR B1913+16 does not usefully constrain\nthe amplitude of radiative precession in old pulsars.\nNo unambiguous instances of non-relativistic precession are known. Lyne et al. (1988)\nreported a quasi-sinusoidal variation with a period of \u2248 20 months in the phase residuals of six\nyears of Crab timing data, and a similar feature was claimed to exist in Vela (McCulloch et al.\n1990). However, the variation may be an artifact of an unexpectedly high \u03c9\u0308 during the exponential\nrelaxation following an overlooked glitch. The quasi-periodic nature of the Vela glitches (Lyne et\nal. 1996) is also suggestive of precession, but the observed \u03c9\u0307 as a function of time does not resemble\nFigure 5. Ulmer (1994) reported that the intensity ratio of the two peaks in the gamma-ray pulse\nof the Crab seems to vary sinusoidally with a period of \u2248 14 yr in both the 50\u2013500 keV and 50 MeV\nbands (but not in the optical). However, the 14-yr period differs from that observed by Lyne et\nal. (1988) and a 60 s modulation of the Crab's optical pulses found by \u010cade\u017e et al. (1997).\nDirect measurements of \u03b1 from pulsar polarization swings do not show any evidence for\nsecular changes on a yearly time-scale. It has been claimed that changes in \u03b1 on a time-scale\nof \u223c 104 yr explain the braking indices of the Crab and Vela, and sudden jumps in \u03b1 explain\nthe persistent increase in \u03c9\u0307 following a glitch (Allen & Horvath 1997; Link & Epstein 1997),\nbut the relevant time-scales are too long and too short, respectively, to be precession-related.\nTauris & Manchester (1997) used polarization-swing data for more than 100 pulsars to construct\nthe \u03b1 distribution of the pulsar population, corrected for decreasing beam radius with age. The\ncorrected distribution is skewed towards small \u03b1, with h\u03b1i decreasing on a time-scale of \u2248 107 yr\n- once again, too gradual to be a precession-related effect.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nThe observational evidence against substantial changes in pulse profiles and polarization\nproperties implies that any precession initially present is damped rapidly. Consequently, direct\ndetection of a precessing, isolated pulsar may only be possible in the immediate aftermath of a\nGalactic supernova. If the precession amplitude is sufficiently large, the newly born pulsar will\nshine intermittently, as its emission cone drifts into and out of the line of sight, as well as exhibit\nthe profile and polarization changes discussed above.\n\n4.3.\n\nCrustal Heating by Internal Friction\n\nFrictional damping inside a neutron star proceeds rapidly in theory. Several authors have\nestimated the dissipation times due to time-dependent elastic strain (Chau & Henriksen 1971;\nMacy 1974) and imperfect core-crust coupling (Shaham 1977; de Campli 1980; Alpar & \u00d6gelman\n1987; Link et al. 1993) and found them to be small compared to the present ages of young,\nCrab-like pulsars. (The estimates assume a small precession amplitude; cf. Section 3.) In addition,\nthere is the analogy of friction inside the Earth. Dynamic satellite measurements have revealed\nthat the Earth's non-hydrostatic ellipsoid of inertia has its e3 axis parallel to \u03c9 to an excellent\napproximation5 (Lambeck 1980, p. 31), and that the direction of e3 fluctuates by less than 1\u2032\u2032\nunder the action of solar and lunar tides, compared to \u2248 10\u25e6 for the e1 and e2 axes (Bur\u0161a & P\u011b\u010d\n1993, p. 227). Clearly, any drift of \u03c9 away from e3 is rapidly damped.\nIn this paper, we are not concerned with the precise origin of the friction in a neutron star;\nwe simply suppose it exists and examine the fate of the dissipated energy. Initially, when the star\n2 + \u03c9 2 ) + I 2 \u03c9 2 ]1/2 and\nis precessing, its angular momentum and energy are given by Li = [I12 (\u03c91i\n3 3i\n2i\n2 + \u03c9 2 ) + 1 I \u03c9 2 . After the precession has been damped, the final angular momentum\nEi = 12 I1 (\u03c91i\n3\n2i\n3i\n2\n2 ( \u03c9 \u2192 e by analogy with the Earth). If the\nand energy are given by Lf = I3 \u03c93f and Ef = 12 I3 \u03c93f\n3\ndamping occurs over a time \u03c4d that is short compared to \u03c40 and \u03c41 , we have Li \u2248 Lf and hence\n2\n2\n+ \u03c92i\n).\n\u2206E = \u2212 21 \u01ebI1 (\u03c91i\n\n(27)\n\nFor \u03c91i \u223c \u03c92i \u223c \u03c90 (Section 3), the total dissipated energy is of order \u01ebI1 \u03c902 .\nWe now suppose that the dissipation is localized in the inner and outer crusts, where\nthe ions are organized into a lattice and the shear modulus is non-zero, and we estimate the\nresulting increase in the star's thermal luminosity L. The thermal conduction time in the crust,\n\u03c4cond , is not known with certainty (Nomoto & Tsuruta 1987), so we appeal to the extreme\ncases of slow cooling (\u03c4d \u226a \u03c4cond ) and fast cooling (\u03c4d \u226b \u03c4cond ) to place bounds on L. In\nthe regime \u03c4d \u226a \u03c4cond , the dissipated energy \u2206E is stored in the crust as heat for a time\n\u03c4cond . The crustal heat capacity at a temperature T is given by cv \u2248 312kb (T /\u03b8d )3 (Shapiro &\nTeukolsky 1983, p. 100) in the regime where the Debye temperature \u03b8d \u2248 2 \u00d7 1010 K satisfies\n5\n\nI thank P. Goldreich for bringing this fact to my attention.\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nT \u226a \u03b8d (i.e. at a density \u03c1 \u2248 1 \u00d7 1014 g cm\u22123 ). Taking \u2206E = \u01ebI1 \u03c902 , we find that the final\ntemperature of an iron crust of mass 10\u22123 M is Tf = 2 \u00d7 109 (\u01eb\u03c902 )1/4 K, and its thermal luminosity\nis L = 4\u03c0R2 \u03c3Tf4 = 1 \u00d7 1046 \u01eb\u03c902 erg s\u22121 . In the opposite regime \u03c4d \u226b \u03c4cond , the dissipated heat is\nconducted rapidly through the crust and one has L = \u2206E/\u03c4d = 1 \u00d7 1045 \u01eb\u03c902 \u03c4d\u22121 erg s\u22121 (cf. de\nCampli 1980, p.308), less than the former value for \u03c4d > 0.1 s.\nThe above estimates imply that the minimum thermal luminosity of a newly born pulsar due\nto frictional damping of its radiative precession is\n31\n\nL \u2248 3 \u00d7 10\n\n\u0012\n\n\u01eb\n10\u221212\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\n\u03c9\n3\n10 rad s\u22121\n\n\u00132 \u0012\n\n\u03c4d\n1 yr\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\nerg s\u22121 .\n\n(28)\n\n\u22123\nThis ought to be detectable given \u03c4d <\n\u223c 10 yr even if there is significant magnetospheric X-ray\nemission beamed towards the observer and with \u03c4d <\n\u223c 3 yr if there is not. The duration of the\nthermal source is the maximum of \u03c4d and \u03c4cond , starting from the time when the star first\ncrystallizes into a body with a rigid crust spinning down electromagnetically. If the crystallization\nepoch occurs very shortly after the supernova explosion itself, it may not be possible to detect L\nat all.\n\n5.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper, the rotation of a rigid, aspherical, internally frictionless neutron star is analyzed.\nWe show that, in general, the free precession period \u03c42 due to elastic and magnetic deformations\nis comparable to the radiative precession period \u03c41 associated with the near-field component of\nthe radiation torque. In other words, the 'free' precession is not truly free, a fact that has been\noverlooked in the literature to date.\nIn the regime \u03c41 \u223c \u03c42 , the star rotates in a distinctive way: (i) it precesses and nutates\nanharmonically, typically with an amplitude of tens of degrees (Section 3.2); (ii) the magnetic\ninclination angle \u03b1 swings through tens of degrees during one precession period (Section 3.3); (iii)\nthe precession can persist or decay to zero (i.e. steady rotation) depending on the parameters\n\u03b2 and \u03c7 and the initial orientation of \u03c9 (Section 3.4); and (iv) the frequency derivative \u03c9\u0307 < 0\noscillates about its overall spin-down trend, exhibiting spiky, glitch-like behaviour for triaxial stars\nwith \u01eb\u03c41 \u2248 \u01eb\u2032 \u03c42 (Section 3.5).\nThe precession and nutation lead to fractional changes of order unity in the pulse profile,\npolarization swing and \u03c9\u0307 of an isolated pulsar on a time-scale \u223c x0 \u03c40 \u226a \u03c40 , with x0 \u03c40 \u2248 10 yr for\nyoung, Crab-like objects and x0 \u03c40 \u2248 103 yr for old pulsars. Such changes are not observed. One\nplausible explanation is that a young neutron star has \u03c9 parallel to e3 when its crust crystallizes\nshortly after birth - but this is not true for neutron stars with large hydromagnetic deformations,\ngiven current viscosity estimates (Section 4.1). Another explanation is that the precession and\nnutation are damped by internal friction, perhaps due to time-dependent elastic strains in the\ncrust. If the damping takes place over a time \u03c4d , we show (Section 4.3) that the dissipated energy\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\n\u2206E \u2248 \u01ebI1 \u03c902 either heats the crust to a temperature Tf = 2 \u00d7 109 (\u01eb\u03c902 )1/4 K for \u03c4d \u226a \u03c4cond ,\nyielding a thermal X-ray luminosity L = 1 \u00d7 1046 \u01eb\u03c902 erg s\u22121 , or else is conducted rapidly to the\nsurface, yielding L = 1 \u00d7 1045 \u01eb\u03c902 \u03c4d\u22121 erg s\u22121 . The luminosity L may be detectable depending on\nhow soon after the supernova explosion the neutron-star crust crystallizes, and the intensity of\nmagnetospheric X-ray emission at that epoch.\nI thank Sterl Phinney, Peter Goldreich and Jon Arons for comments.

The electromagnetic fields E(x, t) and B(x, t)\ngenerated by a magnetized, conducting sphere rotating in vacuo were derived using a multipole\nmethod by Deutsch (1955) and subsequently corrected for minor typographical errors by Melatos\n(1997); see also Kaburaki (1981). The radiation torque exerted on the rotating sphere can be\ncalculated from E(x, t) and B(x, t) by integrating the angular momentum flux vector over any\nsurface S enclosing the sphere:\nN = \u03b50\n\nZ h\nS\n\ni\n\n(x \u00d7 E) E * dS + c2 (x \u00d7 B) B * dS \u2212 12 (E 2 + c2 B 2 )(x \u00d7 dS) .\n\n(A1)\n\nLet the radius of the sphere be r0 , let its angular frequency be \u03c9, let \u03b1 denote the angle between\nits rotation and magnetic axes, and assume that the frozen-in magnetic field is dipolar, with polar\nmagnitude B0 . Then, in a Cartesian coordinate system (x, y, z) where the z axis is oriented along\nthe instantaneous rotation axis \u03c9 and the magnetic axis m simultaneously lies in the x-z plane,\nthe instantaneous radiation torque assumes the form\n(Nx , Ny , Nz ) =\n\ni\n2\u03c0B02 r06 \u03c9 3 h\n2\nsin\n\u03b1\ncos\n\u03b1F\n(x\n),\nsin\n\u03b1\ncos\n\u03b1G(x\n),\n\u2212\nsin\n\u03b1F\n(x\n)\n,\n0\n0\n0\n\u03bc0 c3\n\nwith\nF (x0 ) =\nG(x0 ) =\n\n5(x60\n\n1\nx40\n+\n,\n\u2212 3x40 + 36) 3(x20 + 1)\n\n3(x20 + 6)\n3 \u2212 2x20\n+\n.\n5x0 (x60 \u2212 3x40 + 36) 15x0 (x20 + 1)\n\n(A2)\n\n(A3)\n(A4)\n\nStrictly speaking, it is incorrect to refer to (A2) as an instantaneous torque, because it is calculated\nunder the assumption that the star has been rotating, and will continue to rotate, at a constant\nangular frequency \u03c9; formally, it is assumed that the radiation fields exist for all t and are\nproportional to ei\u03c9t , as for an infinitely massive star. However, the approximation is an excellent\none for a neutron star, where the braking and precession time-scales \u03c40 , \u03c41 , \u03c42 (Sections 2.2, 2.3)\nsatisfy \u03c40 , \u03c41 , \u03c42 \u226b \u03c9 \u22121 .\nThe form factors (A3) and (A4) differ from the expressions F (x0 ) = 1/3 and G(x0 ) = 1/2x0\nappearing in previous works (Davis & Goldstein 1970; Goldreich 1970). There are two reasons for\nthis difference: (i) previous authors only included terms of leading order in the small parameter\nx0 (cf. Section 3.6), whereas (A3) and (A4) are exact for arbitrary x0 ; and (ii) previous authors\nmodelled the star as a sphere of uniform internal magnetization, whereas in this paper the star\nis modelled as a perfectly conducting sphere with a point magnetic dipole at its centre (Deutsch\n1955), affecting the polynomial coefficients in (A3) and (A4).\nThe Cartesian coordinate system (x, y, z) rotates with respect to the star as \u03c9 changes\norientation under the action of N. Among other things, this causes \u03b1 to change with time. In\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\norder to write down Euler's equations, it is necessary to reexpress N in body coordinates that\nare fixed with respect to the star. We choose the body axes to be the principal axes of the star's\nellipsoid of inertia, e1 , e2 and e3 ; the magnetic axis m, which is also fixed with respect to the star,\nis taken to lie in the plane spanned by e1 and e3 , at an angle \u03c7 to e3 (a slight loss of generality).\nThe transformation from (x, y, z) to body coordinates is time-dependent, but it is not an Euler\ntransformation because (x, y, z) is a non-inertial frame. It is described by a matrix [Aij ], defined\nthrough (e1 , e2 , e3 ) = [Aij ] * (i, j, k), which can be represented in the form\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\ncos \u03c6 cos \u03b8 cos \u03c8 \u2212 sin \u03c6 sin \u03c8\nsin \u03c6 cos \u03b8 cos \u03c8 + cos \u03c6 sin \u03c8 \u2212 sin \u03b8 cos \u03c8\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n[Aij ] = \uf8ed \u2212 cos \u03c6 cos \u03b8 sin \u03c8 \u2212 sin \u03c6 cos \u03c8 \u2212 sin \u03c6 cos \u03b8 sin \u03c8 + cos \u03c6 cos \u03c8 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c8 \uf8f8 , (A5)\ncos \u03c6 sin \u03b8\nsin \u03c6 sin \u03b8\ncos \u03b8\nwhere the angles \u03c6, \u03c8, \u03b8 (not Euler angles) depend on t through the principal angular velocity\ncomponents \u03c91 , \u03c92 , \u03c93 as follows:\ncos \u03c6 =\nsin \u03c6 =\ncos \u03c8 =\nsin \u03c8 =\ncos \u03b8 =\n\n\u03c9 cos \u03c7 \u2212 \u03c93 cos \u03b1\n,\nsin \u03b1(\u03c9 2 \u2212 \u03c932 )1/2\n\u03c92 sin \u03c7\n\u2212\n,\nsin \u03b1(\u03c9 2 \u2212 \u03c932 )1/2\n\u03c91\n,\n\u2212 2\n(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c932 )1/2\n\u03c92\n,\n2\n(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c932 )1/2\n\u03c93 /\u03c9,\n\n(A10)\n\n\u03c932 /\u03c9 2 )1/2 .\n\n(A11)\n\nsin \u03b8 = (1 \u2212\n\n(A6)\n(A7)\n(A8)\n(A9)\n\nThe angle \u03b1 is chosen to lie in the range 0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 \u03c0 and satisfies\n\u03c9 cos \u03b1 = \u03c91 sin \u03c7 + \u03c93 cos \u03c7.\n\n(A12)\n\nUpon substituting (A6) to (A12) into (A5) and employing the relation (N1 , N2 , N3 ) =\n[Aij ] * (Nx , Ny , Nz ), we arrive at the principal components of the radiation torque featured on the\nright-hand sides of Euler's equations (1), (2) and (3).\n\nB.\n\nAPPROXIMATE ANALYTIC SOLUTION FOR \u01eb\u2032 = 0, \u03c7 = 90\u25e6\n\nIn this appendix, we derive an approximate solution to Euler's equations (1), (2) and (3) for\na biaxial star (\u01eb\u2032 = 0) with \u03c7 = 90\u25e6 . The solution is accurate provided the precession periods \u03c41\n(radiative) and \u03c42 (free) are much smaller than the braking time-scale \u03c40 .\nWhen the slow braking terms, proportional to (\u03c90 \u03c40 )\u22121 F (x0 ), are neglected relative to the\nfast precessive terms, proportional to \u01eb and (\u03c90 \u03c40 )\u22121 uG(x0 ), Euler's equations reduce to the\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nzeroth-order system (15) to (17) which, in the special case \u03c7 = 90\u25e6 , reduces to\nu\u03071 = \u2212\u01ebu2 u3 ,\nu\u03072 = \u01eb(1 + \u03b2\nu\u03073 = \u2212\u01eb\u03b2\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22121\n\n(B1)\n)u1 u3 ,\n\n(B2)\n\nu1 u2 .\n\n(B3)\n\nThe solutions of (B1) to (B3) are Jacobian elliptic functions.
