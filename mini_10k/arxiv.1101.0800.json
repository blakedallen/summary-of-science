Recent interest has focused on the Gl 581 planetary system (also designated GJ 581 in the literature). It\nwas already known to harbor three planets, including two\nsuper-Earth planets that straddle its habitable zone: Gl 581\nb with a period of 5.37d (Bonfils et al. 2005b), Gl 581 c (period 12.9d) and d (period 82d) (Udry et al. 2007). Armed\nwith additional HARPS data, Mayor et al. (2009) reported\nthe detection of an additional planet Gl 581e with a minimum mass of 1.9M\u2295 and a period of 3.15d. They also corrected previous confusion about the orbital period of Gl 581d\n(the outermost planet) with a one-year alias at 82 days. The\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: gregory@phas.ubc.ca\n\nrevised period is 66.8d, and positions the semi-major axis\ninside the habitable zone of the low mass star. Vogt et al.\n(2010) reported the analysis of the combined HIRES and\nHARPS data set spanning 11y, claiming the detection of two\nadditional planets Gl 581f & g. Gl 581f has a period of 433d,\na minimum-mass of 7.0M\u2295 , and a semi-major axis of 0.758\nau. Gl 581g has a period of 36.6d, a minimum-mass 3.1M\u2295 ,\nand a semi-major axis of 0.146 au. The estimated equilibrium temperature of Gl 581g is 228 K, placing it squarely in\nthe middle of the habitable zone of the star. The Vogt et al.\n(2010) analysis assumed circular orbits for all 6 planets.\nGregory 2009 and Gregory & Fischer 2010 presented a\nBayesian hybrid or fusion MCMC algorithm that incorporates parallel tempering (PT), simulated annealing and a\ngenetic crossover operation to facilitate the detection of a\nglobal minimum in \u03c72 . This enables the efficient exploration\nof a large model parameter space starting from a random\nlocation. When implemented with a multi-planet Kepler\nmodel, it is able to identify any significant periodic signal\ncomponent in the data that satisfies Kepler's laws and is able\n\n\f2\n\nP. C. Gregory\n\nto function as a multi-planet Kepler periodogram 1 . In addition, the Bayesian MCMC algorithm provides full marginal\nparameters distributions. The algorithm includes an innovative adaptive control system that automates the selection of\nefficient parameter proposal distributions even if the parameters are highly correlated Gregory 2010. A recent application of the algorithm (Gregory & Fischer 2010) confirmed\nthe existence of a disputed second planet (Fischer et al.\n2002) in 47 Ursae Majoris (47 UMa) and provided orbital\nconstraints on a possible additional long period planet with\na period \u223c 10000d.\nThis paper reports the results of a re-analysis of the\nHARPS (Mayor et al. 2009) and HIRES data (Vogt et al.\n2010) for Gl 581 using the above Bayesian multi-planet Kepler periodogram. Section 2 provides an introduction to our\nBayesian approach and describes the adaptive fusion MCMC\nalgorithm. Section 3 gives the model equations and priors. Sections 4 and 5 present the parameter estimation and\nmodel selection results for the analysis of the HARPS data\nalone. Section 6 is devoted to the analysis of the HIRES data\nfollowed by the analysis of the combination of HIRES and\nHARPS data. The final two sections are devoted to discussion and conclusions.\n\n2\n\nTHE ADAPTIVE FUSION MCMC\n\nThe adaptive fusion 2 MCMC (FMCMC) is a very general\nBayesian nonlinear model fitting program. After specifying\nthe model, Mi , the data, D, and priors, I, Bayes theorem dictates the target joint probability distribution for the\nmodel parameters which is given by\n~\n~ i , I) \u00d7 p(D|Mi , X,\n~ I).\np(X|D,\nMi , I) = C p(X|M\n\n(1)\n\n~ represent the\nwhere C is the normalization constant and X\nset of model parameters. The first term on the RHS of the\n~ i , I), is the prior probability distribution of\nequation, p(X|M\n~\nX, prior to the consideration of the current data D. The\n~ Mi , I), is called the likelihood and it is\nsecond term, p(D|X,\nthe probability that we would have obtained the measured\n~\ndata D for this particular choice of parameter vector X,\nmodel Mi , and prior information I. At the very least, the\nprior information, I, must specify the class of alternative\nmodels (hypotheses) being considered (hypothesis space of\ninterest) and the relationship between the models and the\ndata (how to compute the likelihood). In some simple cases\nthe log of the likelihood is simply proportional to the familiar\n\u03c72 statistic. For further details of the likelihood function for\nthis type of problem see Gregory (2005b).\nTo compute the marginals for any subset of the\nparameters it is necessary to integrate the joint probability\ndistribution over the remaining parameters. For example,\nthe marginal probability density function (PDF) of the\norbital period in a one planet radial velocity model fit is\n\n1\n\nFollowing on from the pioneering work on Bayesian periodograms by Jaynes (1987) and Bretthorst (1988)\n2 In earlier papers the algorithm was referred to as a hybrid\nMCMC. We subsequently learned that this term already exists in\nthe literature in connection with a Hamiltonian version of MCMC.\nIn this paper we replace the term hybrid by fusion.\n\ngiven by\n\np(P |D, M1 , I)\n\n=\n\nZ\n\ndK\n\nZ\n\ndV\n\nZ\n\nde\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c7\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c9\n\nZ\n\nds\n\n\u00d7 p(P, K, V, e, \u03c7, \u03c9, s|D, M1 , I)\n\u221d\n\np(P |M1 , I)\n\nZ\n\ndK * * *\n\nZ\n\nds\n\n\u00d7 p(K, V, e, \u03c7, \u03c9, s|M1 , I)\n\n\u00d7 p(D|M1 , P, K, V, e, \u03c7, \u03c9, s, I),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere p(P, K, V, e, \u03c7, \u03c9, s|D, M1 , I) is the target joint probability distribution of the radial velocity model parameters\n(P, K, V, e, \u03c7, \u03c9) and s is an extra noise parameter which is\ndiscussed in Section 3. p(P |M1 , I) is the prior for the orbital\nperiod parameter, p(K, V, e, \u03c7, \u03c9, s|M1 , I) is the joint prior\nfor the other parameters, and p(D|M1 , P, K, V, e, \u03c7, \u03c9, s, I)\nis the likelihood. For a five planet model fit we need to integrate over 26 parameters to obtain p(P |D, M1 , I). Integration is more difficult than maximization, however, the\nBayesian solution provides the most accurate information\nabout the parameter errors and correlations without the\nneed for any additional calculations, i.e., Monte Carlo simulations. Bayesian model selection requires integrating over\nall the model parameters.\nIn high dimensions, the principle tool for carrying out\nthe integrals is Markov chain Monte Carlo based on the\nMetropolis algorithm. The greater efficiency of an MCMC\nstems from its ability, after an initial burn-in period, to generate samples in parameter space in direct proportion to the\njoint target probability distribution. In contrast, straight\nMonte Carlo integration randomly samples the parameter\nspace and wastes most of its time sampling regions of very\nlow probability.\nMCMC algorithms avoid the requirement for completely independent samples, by constructing a kind of random walk in the model parameter space such that the number of samples in a particular region of this space is proportional to a target posterior density for that region.

Multiple MCMC chains are run in parallel.\n~ of model Mi ,\nThe joint distribution for the parameters (X)\nfor a particular chain, is given by\n~\n~ i , I) \u00d7 p(D|X,\n~ Mi , I)\u03b2 .\n\u03c0(X|D,\nMi , I, \u03b2) \u221d p(X|M\n\n(5)\n\nEach MCMC chain corresponding to a different \u03b2, with the\nvalue of \u03b2 ranging from zero to 1. When the exponent \u03b2 = 1,\nthe term on the LHS of the equation is the target joint prob~\nability distribution for the model parameters, p(X|D,\nMi , I).\nFor \u03b2 \u226a 1, the distribution is much flatter.\nIn equation 5, an exponent \u03b2 = 0 yields a joint density distribution equal to the prior. The reciprocal of \u03b2 is\nanalogous to a temperature, the higher the temperature the\nbroader the distribution. For parameter estimation purposes\n8 chains with\n\u03b2 = {0.09, 0.13, 0.20, 0.29, 0.39, 0.52, 0.72, 1.0} were employed. At an interval of 10 iterations, a pair of adjacent\nchains on the tempering ladder are chosen at random and\na proposal made to swap their parameter states. A Monte\nCarlo acceptance rule determines the probability for the proposed swap to occur (e.g., Gregory 2005a, equation 12.12).\nThis swap allows for an exchange of information across the\npopulation of parallel simulations. In low \u03b2 (higher temperature) simulations, radically different configurations can\narise, whereas in higher \u03b2 (lower temperature) states, a configuration is given the chance to refine itself. The lower \u03b2\nchains can be likened to a series of scouts that explore the\nparameter terrain on different scales. The final samples are\ndrawn from the \u03b2 = 1 chain, which corresponds to the desired target probability distribution. The choice of \u03b2 values can be checked by computing the swap acceptance rate.\nWhen they are too far apart the swap rate drops to very low\nvalues. A swap acceptance rate of \u2248 40% works well.\nAt each iteration, a single joint proposal to jump to\na new location in the parameter space is generated from\nindependent Gaussian proposal distributions (centered on\nthe current parameter location), one for each parameter. In\ngeneral, the \u03c3's of these Gaussian proposal distributions are\ndifferent because the parameters can be very different entities. If the \u03c3's are chosen too small, successive samples will\nbe highly correlated and will require many iterations to obtain an equilibrium set of samples. If the \u03c3's are too large,\nthen proposed samples will very rarely be accepted. The\nprocess of choosing a set of useful proposal \u03c3's when dealing with a large number of different parameters can be very\ntime consuming. In parallel tempering MCMC, this problem is compounded because of the need for a separate set of\nGaussian proposal \u03c3's for each tempering chain. This process is automated by an innovative three stage statistical\ncontrol system (Gregory 2007b, Gregory 2009) in which the\nerror signal is proportional to the difference between the\ncurrent joint parameter acceptance rate and a target accep-\n\n3\n\ntance rate, typically 25% (Roberts et al. 1997). A schematic\nof the first two stages of the adaptive control system (CS) is\nshown in Fig. 1. A third stage that handles highly correlated\nparameters is described in Section 2.1.\nThe first stage CS, which involves annealing the set of\nGaussian proposal distribution \u03c3's, was described in Gregory 2005a. An initial set of proposal \u03c3's (\u2248 10% of the\nprior range for each parameter) are used for each chain. During the major cycles, the joint acceptance rate is measured\nbased on the current proposal \u03c3's and compared to a target\nacceptance rate. During the minor cycles, each proposal \u03c3\nis separately perturbed to determine an approximate gradient in the acceptance rate. The \u03c3's are then jointly modified\nby a small increment in the direction of this gradient. This\nis done for each of the parallel chains. Proposals to swap\nparameter values between chains are allowed during major\ncycles but not within minor cycles.\nThe annealing of the proposal \u03c3's occurs while the FMCMC is homing in on any significant peaks in the target\nprobability distribution. Concurrent with this, another aspect of the annealing operation takes place whenever the\nMarkov chain is started from a location in parameter space\nthat is far from the best fit values. This automatically arises\nbecause all the models considered incorporate an extra additive noise term (Gregory 2005b) whose probability distribution is Gaussian with zero mean and with an unknown\nstandard deviation s. When the \u03c72 of the fit is very large,\nthe Bayesian Markov chain automatically inflates s to include anything in the data that cannot be accounted for by\nthe model with the current set of parameters and the known\nmeasurement errors. This results in a smoothing out of the\ndetailed structure in the \u03c72 surface and, as pointed out by\nFord (2006), allows the Markov chain to explore the large\nscale structure in parameter space more quickly. The chain\nbegins to decrease the value of the extra noise as it settles in\nnear the best-fit parameters. An example of this is shown in\nFig. 2 for a two planet fit to the HARPS data as discussed\nin Section 4.1. The three panels shows the evolution of the\nLog10 [Prior \u00d7 Likelihood], the s parameter and the two period parameters. In the early stages the extra noise is inflated\nto around 16m s\u22121 and then rapidly decays to much lower\nvalues as it homes in on possible solutions. This is similar to\nsimulated annealing, but does not require choosing a cooling\nscheme. In this example, the starting parameter values were\nfar from the best and the MCMC algorithm finds several less\nprobable solutions on route to a final best choice. Initially it\nhomes in on the two periods of 5.37 and 66.9d and the CS\nswitches off around iteration 220,000, but around iteration\n500,000 it detects a much more probable solution for the\nperiod combination of 5.37 and 12.9d. In this example the\nadaptive control system switched on again briefly following\nthe detection of the much improved solution.\nAlthough the first stage CS achieves the desired joint\nacceptance rate, it often happens that a subset of the proposal \u03c3's are too small leading to an excessive autocorrelation in the FMCMC iterations for these parameters. Part of\nthe second stage CS corrects for this. The goal of the second stage is to achieve a set of proposal \u03c3's that equalizes\nthe FMCMC acceptance rates when new parameter values\nare proposed separately and achieves the desired acceptance\nrate when they are proposed jointly. Details of the second\nstage CS were given in Gregory 2007b.\n\n\f4\n\nP. C. Gregory\n\nFigure 1. The first of two schematics on the operation of the adaptive fusion MCMC (FMCMC) algorithm.\n\nThe first stage is run only once at the beginning, but the\nsecond stage can be executed repeatedly, whenever a significantly improved parameter solution emerges. Frequently, the\nalgorithm homes in on the most significant peak within the\nspan of the first stage CS and the second stage improves the\nchoice of proposal \u03c3's based on the highest probability parameter set. Occasionally, a new higher (by a user specified\nthreshold) target probability parameter set emerges after\nthe first two stages of the CS have completed. The control\nsystem has the ability to detect this and automatically reactivate the second stage. In this sense the CS is adaptive.\nIf this happens the iteration corresponding to the end of\nthe control system is reset. The requirement that the transi~ t+1 |X\n~ t ) be\ntion kernel be time independent means that q(X\ntime independent, so useful FMCMC simulation data are\nobtained only after the CS is switched off.\nThe adaptive capability of the control system can be\nappreciated from an examination of Fig. 1. The upper left\nportion of the figure depicts the FMCMC iterations from the\n8 parallel chains, each corresponding to a different tempering\nlevel \u03b2 as indicated on the extreme left. One of the outputs\nobtained from each chain at every iteration (shown at the\nfar right) is the log prior + log likelihood. This information\nis continuously fed to the CS which constantly updates the\nmost probable parameter combination regardless of which\nchain the parameter set occurred in. This is passed to the\n'Peak parameter set' block of the CS. Its job is to decide if a\nsignificantly more probable parameter set has emerged since\nthe last execution of the second stage CS. If so, the second\nstage CS is re-run using the new more probable parameter\nset which is the basic adaptive feature of the existing CS.\n\nThe CS also includes a genetic algorithm block which is\nshown in the bottom right of Fig. 1. The current parameter\nset can be treated as a set of genes. In the present version,\none gene consists of the parameter set that specifies one orbit. On this basis, a three planet model has three genes. At\nany iteration there exist within the CS the most probable\n~ max , and the current most probaparameter set to date X\n~ cur . At regular intervals\nble parameter set of the 8 chains, X\n~ cur is swapped for the cor(user specified) each gene from X\n~ max . If either substitution leads to a\nresponding gene in X\n~ max updated. The efhigher probability it is retained and X\nfectiveness of this operation can be tested by comparing the\nnumber of times the gene crossover operation gives rise to\n~ max compared to the number of new X\n~ max\na new value of X\narising from the normal parallel tempering FMCMC iterations. The gene crossover operations prove to be very effec~ max values \u2248 3 times more often.\ntive, and give rise to new X\nOf course, most of these swaps lead to very minor changes\nin probability but occasionally big jumps are created.\n\n~ cur2 , the parameters of the second\nGene swaps from X\n~ max can also be also utimost probable current chain, to X\n~ max at a rate approxlized. This gives rise to new values of X\n~\n~ max . Crossover opimately half that of swaps from Xcur to X\nerations at a random point in the entire parameter set did\nnot prove as effective except in the single planet case where\nthere is only one gene. Further experimentation with this\nconcept is ongoing.\n\n\fBayesian Re-analysis of the Gliese 581 Exoplanet System\n\n5\n\nFigure 3. Schematic outlining the operation of the third stage of the adaptive fusion MCMC algorithm that handles correlated parameters.\n\n2.1\n\nHighly correlated parameters\n\nThe part of the algorithm described above (Figure 1) is most\nefficient when working with model parameters that are independent or transformed to new independent parameters.\nNew parameter values are jointly proposed based on independent Gaussian proposal distributions ('I' scheme), one\nfor each parameter. Initially, only this 'I' proposal system is\nused and it is clear that if there are strong correlations between any parameters the \u03c3's of the independent Gaussian\nproposals will need to be very small for any proposal to be\naccepted and consequently convergence will be very slow.\nHowever, the accepted 'I' proposals will generally cluster\nalong the correlation path. In the optional third stage of the\ncontrol system shown in Figure 2.1, every second accepted 'I'\nproposal is appended to a correlated sample buffer. Only the\n300 most recent additions to the buffer are retained. A 'C'\nproposal is generated from the difference between a pair of\nrandomly selected samples drawn from the correlated sample buffer, after multiplication by a constant. The value of\nthis constant is computed automatically by another control\nsystem module which ensures that the 'C' proposal acceptance rate is close to 25%. With very little computational\noverhead, the 'C' proposals provide the scale and direction\nfor efficient jumps in a correlated parameter space.\nThe final proposal distribution is a random selection of\n'I' and 'C' proposals such that each is employed 50% of the\ntime. The overhead to generate the 'C' proposals is minimal.\nThe combination ensures that the whole parameter space\ncan be reached and that the FMCMC chain is aperiodic.\n\nThe parallel tempering feature operates as before to avoid\nbecoming trapped in a local probability maximum.\nBecause the 'C' proposals reflect the parameter correlations, large jumps are possible allowing for much more efficient movement in parameter space than can be achieved by\nthe 'I' proposals alone. Once the first two stages of the control system have been turned off, the third stage continues\nuntil a minimum of an additional 300 accepted 'I' proposals\nhave been added to the buffer and the 'C' proposal acceptance rate is within the range > 0.22 and 6 0.28. At this\npoint further additions to the buffer are terminated and this\nsets a lower bound on the burn-in period.\nFull details on the operation and testing of the combined 'I' and 'C' proposal scheme are given in Gregory 2010.\n\n3\n\nMODELS AND PRIORS\n\nIn this section we describe the model fitting equations and\nthe selection of priors for the model parameters. We have\ninvestigated the Gl 581 data using models ranging from 1\nto 6 planets.

Initially s is inflated and then rapidly decays to\na much lower level as the better fit parameter values are approached.

The two starting periods of 2.5 and 20d are shown on the left hand side of the plot\nat a negative iteration number.\n\n\u03c9 = the longitude of periastron.\n\u03c7 = the fraction of an orbit, prior to the start of data\ntaking, that periastron occurred at. Thus, \u03c7P = the number\nof days prior to ti = 0 that the star was at periastron, for\nan orbital period of P days.\n\u03b8(ti + \u03c7P ) = the true anomaly, the angle of the star in\nits orbit relative to periastron at time ti .\nWe utilize this form of the equation because we obtain\nthe dependence of \u03b8 on ti by solving the conservation of\nangular momentum equation\n2\u03c0[1 + e cos \u03b8(ti + \u03c7 P )]2\nd\u03b8\n= 0.\n\u2212\ndt\nP (1 \u2212 e2 )3/2\n\n(7)\n\nOur algorithm is implemented in Mathematica and it proves\nfaster for Mathematica to solve this differential equation\nthan solve the equations relating the true anomaly to the\nmean anomaly via the eccentric anomaly. Mathematica generates an accurate interpolating function between t and \u03b8\nso the differential equation does not need to be solved sepa-\n\nrately for each ti . Evaluating the interpolating function for\neach ti is very fast compared to solving the differential equation, so the algorithm should be able to handle much larger\nsamples of radial velocity data than those currently available\nwithout a significant increase in computational time. For example, an increase in the data by a factor of 6.5 resulted in\nonly an 18% increase in execution time.\nAs described in more detail in Gregory 2007a, we employed a re-parameterization of \u03c7 and \u03c9 to improve the\nMCMC convergence speed motivated by the work of Ford\n(2006). The two new parameters are \u03c8 = 2\u03c0\u03c7 + \u03c9 and\n\u03c6 = 2\u03c0\u03c7 \u2212 \u03c9. Parameter \u03c8 is well determined for all eccentricities. Although \u03c6 is not well determined for low eccentricities, it is at least orthogonal to the \u03c8 parameter. We\nuse a uniform prior for \u03c8 in the interval 0 to 4\u03c0 and uniform\nprior for \u03c6 in the interval \u22122\u03c0 to +2\u03c0. This insures that a\nprior that is wraparound continuous in (\u03c7, \u03c9) maps into a\nwraparound continuous distribution in (\u03c8, \u03c6). To account\nfor the Jacobian of this re-parameterization it is necessary\nto multiply the Bayesian integrals by a factor of (4\u03c0)\u2212nplan ,\nwhere nplan = the number of planets in the model. Also,\nby utilizing the orthogonal combination (\u03c8, \u03c6) it was not\nnecessary to make use of the 'C' proposal scheme outlined\nin Section 2.1 which typically saves about 25% in execution\ntime.\nIn a Bayesian analysis we need to specify a suitable prior\nfor each parameter. These are tabulated in Table 1. For the\ncurrent problem, the prior given in Equation 5 is the product\nof the individual parameter priors. Detailed arguments for\nthe choice of each prior were given in Gregory 2007a.\nGregory 2007a discussed two different strategies to\nsearch the orbital frequency parameter space for a multiplanet model: (i) an upper bound on f1 6 f2 6 * * * 6 fn\nis utilized to maintain the identity of the frequencies, and\n(ii) all fi are allowed to roam over the entire frequency\nrange and the parameters re-labeled afterwards. Case (ii)\nwas found to be significantly more successful at converging\non the highest posterior probability peak in fewer iterations\nduring repeated blind frequency searches. In addition, case\n(ii) more easily permits the identification of two planets in\n1:1 resonant orbits. We adopted approach (ii) in the current\nanalysis.\nAll of the models considered in this paper incorporate\nan extra noise parameter, s, that can allow for any additional noise beyond the known measurement uncertainties 3 .\nWe assume the noise variance is finite and adopt a Gaussian\ndistribution with a variance s2 . Thus, the combination of\nthe known errors and extra noise has a Gaussian distribution\nwith variance = \u03c3i2 +s2 , where \u03c3i is the standard deviation of\nthe known noise for ith data point. For example, suppose that\nthe star actually has two planets, and the model assumes\nonly one is present. In regard to the single planet model, the\nvelocity variations induced by the unknown second planet\nacts like an additional unknown noise term. Other factors\nlike star spots and chromospheric activity can also con-\n\n3\n\nIn the absence of detailed knowledge of the sampling distribution for the extra noise, we pick a Gaussian because for any given\nfinite noise variance it is the distribution with the largest uncertainty as measured by the entropy, i.e., the maximum entropy\ndistribution (Jaynes 1957, Gregory 2005a section 8.7.4.)\n\n\fBayesian Re-analysis of the Gliese 581 Exoplanet System\n\n7\n\nTable 1.

Several researchers have attempted\nto estimate stellar jitter for individual stars based on statistical correlations with observables (e.g., Saar & Donahue\n1997, Saar et al. 1998, Wright 2005). In general, nature is\nmore complicated than our model and known noise terms.\nMarginalizing s has the desirable effect of treating anything\nin the data that can't be explained by the model and known\nmeasurement errors as noise, leading to conservative estimates of orbital parameters. See Sections 9.2.3 and 9.2.4 of\nGregory (2005a) for a tutorial demonstration of this point.\nIf there is no extra noise then the posterior probability distribution for s will peak at s = 0. The upper limit on s was\nset equal to Kmax . We employed a modified Jeffrey's prior\nfor s with a knee, s0 = 1m s\u22121 .\nWe used two different choices of priors for eccentricity,\na uniform prior and eccentricity noise bias correction filter\nthat is described in the next section.\n\n3.1\n\nEccentricity bias\n\nIn Gregory & Fischer 2010, the velocities of model fit residuals were randomized in multiple trials and processed using\na one planet version of the FMCMC Kepler periodogram.\nIn this situation periodogram probability peaks are purely\nthe result of the effective noise. The orbits corresponding\nto these noise induced periodogram peaks exhibited a well\n\ndefined statistical bias towards high eccentricity. They offered the following explanation for this effect. To mimic a\ncircular velocity orbit the noise points need to be correlated\nover a larger fraction of the orbit than they do to mimic a\nhighly eccentric orbit. For this reason it is more likely that\nnoise will give rise to spurious highly eccentric orbits than\nlow eccentricity orbits.\nGregory & Fischer 2010 characterized this eccentricity\nbias and designed a correction filter that can be used as\nan alternate prior for eccentricity to enhance the detection\nof planetary orbits of low or moderate eccentricity. On the\nbasis of our understanding of the mechanism underlying the\neccentricity bias, we expect the eccentricity prior filter to\nbe generally applicable to searches for low amplitude orbital\nsignals in precision radial velocity data sets. The probability\ndensity function for this filter is shown by the solid black\ncurve in Figure 4 and is given by\npdf (e) = 1.3889\u22121.5212e2 +0.53944e3 \u22121.6605(e\u22120.24821)8 .(9)\nIn a related study, Shen and Turner (2009) explored least\u03c72 Keplerian fits to radial velocity data using synthetic data\nsets. They found that the best fit eccentricities for low signalto-noise ratio K/\u03c3 6 3 and moderate number of observations Nobs 6 60, were systematically biased to higher values,\nleading to a suppression of the number of nearly circular orbits.\nIn the analysis of the Gl 581 data we used the eccentricity noise bias correction filter as the eccentricity prior on\n\n\f8\n\nP.

Only\nvalues within 5 decades of the maximum Log10 [Prior \u00d7 Likelihood] are plotted but without regard to whether the values\noccurred before or after burn-in. Three prominent periods\nwere clearly detected: 5.37, 12.9, 66.9d. The third period parameter exhibited four other peaks but these were all more\nthan 2 decades less probable. The most probable of these\nhas a period \u223c 413d. The spectral peak at 82d coincides\nwith a one year alias (1/67 \u2212 1/365 \u223c 1/82) of the dominant\n67d period. For more on RV aliases see Dawson & Fabrycky\n(2010). The 59d peak is close but not coincident with the\nother one year alias (1/67 + 1/365 \u223c 1/57).\nFigure 9 shows a plot of eccentricity versus period for a\nsample of the FMCMC parameter samples for the 3 planet\nmodel. There is clearly a large uncertainty in the eccentricity\nof the 67d period which extends down to low eccentricities.\nThe 413d period peak exhibits very large eccentricity values.\nGregory & Fischer (2010) showed that it is more likely that\nnoise will give rise to spurious highly eccentric orbits than\nlow eccentricity orbits. To mimic a circular velocity orbit\nthe noise points need to be correlated over a larger fraction\nof the orbit than they do to mimic a highly eccentric orbit. Even though we are using the noise induced eccentricity\nprior proposed in Gregory & Fischer (2010) we still observe\na preponderance of high eccentricity orbital solutions in the\nlow K value regime.\n\nFigure 9. A plot of eccentricity versus period for the 3 planet\nFMCMC Kepler periodogram of the HARPS data.\n\nFigure 10 shows a plot of a subset of the FMCMC parameter marginal distributions for the 3 planet fit of the\nHARPS data after filtering out the post burn-in FMCMC\niterations that correspond to the 3 dominant period peaks at\n5.37, 12.9, and 66.9d. The bottom panel shows the marginal\nfor the unknown standard deviation, s, of the additive Gaussian extra noise term which has a median value of 1.93 m\ns\u22121 . The Bayesian analysis automatically inflates s to account for anything in the data that the model and quoted\nmeasurement errors cannot account for including stellar jitter.\nThe three planet model was also run using a flat uniform eccentricity to compare with the results obtained with\nthe noise induced eccentricity prior. Figure 11 shows a comparison of the eccentricity marginals for the noise induced\nprior (solid black curve) and the uniform prior (grey dashed\ncurve).\n4.3\n\nFour planet model\n\nA one planet fit to the residuals of the three planet fit above\nyielded a dominant Keplerian orbit with a period of 3.15d.\nThe results of our 4 planet Kepler periodogram analysis are\nshown in Figures 12 and 13. All 4 period parameters were\nfree to roam within a search range extending from 1.1d to\n10\u00d7 the data duration. Another run that extended the period search range down to 0.5d yielded the same 4 periods.\nThe median value of extra noise parameter s = 1.36m s\u22121 .\n\n\fP. C.

We filtered the 5 planet MCMC results to only include\nfifth period values from the 400d peak region and used the\nGelman-Rubin (1992) statistic to test for convergence. In\nparallel tempering MCMC, new widely separated parameter values are passed up the line to the \u03b2 = 1 simulation and\nare occasionally accepted. Roughly every 100 iterations the\n\u03b2 = 1 simulation accepts a swap proposal from its neighboring simulation. The final \u03b2 = 1 simulation is thus an\naverage of a very large number of independent \u03b2 = 1 simulations. We divide the \u03b2 = 1 iterations into 10 equal time\nintervals and inter-compared the 10 different essentially independent average distributions for each parameter using a\nGelman-Rubin test. For the five planet model results the\nGelman-Rubin statistic was 6 1.01.\nFigure 16 shows a plot of a subset of the FMCMC parameter marginal distributions for the 5 planet fit of the\nHARPS data after filtering out the post burn-in FMCMC\niterations that correspond to the 5 dominant period peaks\nat 3.15, 5.37, 12.9, 66.9, and 400d. The median value of the\nextra noise parameter s = 1.16m s\u22121 .\n\nSix planet model\n\nWe also carried out a 6 planet Kepler periodogram analysis\nof the HARPS data and the results are shown in Figures 17,\n18, 19, and 20. The best set of parameters from the 5 planet\nfit were used as start parameters and the starting period\nfor sixth period was set = 36d. The most probable sixth\nperiod found was 34.4d. A 34.4d period also appeared as a\nsecondary peak in the 5 planet fit and is evident in Figure 14.\nFigure 19 shows a plot of eccentricity versus period for the\n5 planet FMCMC Kepler periodogram.\nFigure 20 shows a plot of a subset of the FMCMC parameter marginal distributions for the 6 planet fit of the\nHARPS data after filtering out the post burn-in FMCMC\niterations that correspond to the 6 dominant period peaks\nat 3.15, 5.37, 12.9, 34.4, 66.9, and 400d. The median value\nof extra noise parameter s = 1.00m s\u22121 . There is considerable agreement with the 4 and 5 planet marginals shown\nearlier which leads us to conclude that the 66.9d orbit is\nsignificantly eccentric with an e \u2248 0.34. There is an indication that e \u2248 0.12 for the 12.9d orbit. If the 34.4d orbit is\nreal it would also appear to have a significant eccentricity of\n0.49+0.22\n\u22120.17 .\nPhase plots for the 6 planet model are shown in Figure 21. The top left panel shows the data and model fit\nversus 3.15d orbital phase after removing the effects of the\nfive other orbital periods. To construct this phase plot we\nfirst filter out the post burn-in FMCMC iterations that correspond to the 6 dominant period peaks at 3.15, 5.37, 12.9,\n34.4, 66.9, and 400d. The FMCMC output for each of these\niterations is a vector of the 6 planet orbital parameter set\nplus V .

More complicated models contain larger\nnumbers of parameters and thus incur a larger Occam\npenalty, which is automatically incorporated in a Bayesian\nmodel selection analysis in a quantitative fashion (see for\nexample, Gregory 2005a, p. 45). The analysis yields the relative probability of each of the models explored.\nTo compare the posterior probability of the ith planet\nmodel to the four planet model we need to evaluate the\nodds ratio, Oi4 = p(Mi |D, I)/p(M4 |D, I), the ratio of the\nposterior probability of model Mi to model M4 . Application\nof Bayes theorem leads to,\nOi4 =\n\np(Mi |I) p(D|Mi , I)\np(Mi |I)\n\u2261\nBi4\np(M4 |I) p(D|M4 , I)\np(M4 |I)\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the first factor is the prior odds ratio, and the second\nfactor is called the Bayes factor, Bi4 . The Bayes factor is\nthe ratio of the marginal (global) likelihoods of the models.\nThe marginal likelihood for model Mi is given by\np(D|Mi , I) =\n\nZ\n\n~ X|M\n~ i , I) \u00d7 p(D|X,\n~ Mi , I).\ndXp(\n\n(11)\n\nThus Bayesian model selection relies on the ratio of marginal\nlikelihoods, not maximum likelihoods. The marginal likelihood is the weighted average of the conditional likelihood,\nweighted by the prior probability distribution of the model\nparameters and s. This procedure is referred to as marginalization.\nThe marginal likelihood can be expressed as the product of the maximum likelihood and the Occam penalty (see\nGregory 2005a, page 48). The Bayes factor will favor the\nmore complicated model only if the maximum likelihood ratio is large enough to overcome this penalty. In the simple\ncase of a single parameter with a uniform prior of width\n\u2206X, and a centrally peaked likelihood function with char-\n\n13\n\nacteristic width \u03b4X, the Occam factor is \u2248 \u03b4X/\u2206X. If the\ndata is useful then generally \u03b4X \u226a \u2206X. For a model with\nm parameters, each parameter will contribute a term to the\noverall Occam penalty. The Occam penalty depends not only\non the number of parameters but also on the prior range of\neach parameter (prior to the current data set, D), as symbolized in this simplified discussion by \u2206X. If two models\nhave some parameters in common then the prior ranges for\nthese parameters will cancel in the calculation of the Bayes\nfactor. To make good use of Bayesian model selection, we\nneed to fully specify priors that are independent of the current data D. The sensitivity of the marginal likelihood to the\nprior range depends on the shape of the prior and is much\ngreater for a uniform prior than a Jeffreys prior (e.g., see\nGregory 2005a, page 61). In most instances we are not particularly interested in the Occam factor itself, but only in the\nrelative probabilities of the competing models as expressed\nby the Bayes factors. Because the Occam factor arises automatically in the marginalization procedure, its effect will\nbe present in any model selection calculation. Note: no Occam factors arise in parameter estimation problems. Parameter estimation can be viewed as model selection where the\ncompeting models have the same complexity so the Occam\npenalties are identical and cancel out.\nThe MCMC algorithm produces samples which are in\nproportion to the posterior probability distribution which\nis fine for parameter estimation but one needs the proportionality constant for estimating the model marginal\nlikelihood. Clyde et al. (2006) reviewed the state of techniques for model selection from a statistics perspective and\nFord & Gregory (2006) have evaluated the performance of\na variety of marginal likelihood estimators in the exoplanet\ncontext.\nEstimating the marginal likelihood is a very big challenge for models with large numbers of parameters, e.g., our\nsix planet model has 32 parameters. In this work we employ the nested restricted Monte Carlo (NRMC) method described in Gregory & Fischer 2010 to estimate the marginal\nlikelihoods. Monte Carlo (MC) integration can be very inefficient in exploring the whole prior parameter range because it randomly samples the whole volume. The fraction\nof the prior volume of parameter space containing significant\nprobability rapidly declines as the number of dimensions increase. For example, if the fractional volume with significant\nprobability is 0.1 in one dimension then in 32 dimensions\nthe fraction might be of order 10\u221232 . In restricted MC integration (RMC) this is much less of a problem because the\nvolume of parameter space sampled is greatly restricted to\na region delineated by the outer borders of the marginal\ndistributions of the parameters for the particular model.\nIn nested RMC (NRMC) integration, multiple boundaries are constructed based on credible regions ranging from\n30% to > 99%, as needed. We are then able to compute\nthe contribution to the total integral from each nested interval and sum these contributions. For example, for the\ninterval between the 30% and 60% credible regions, we generate random parameter samples within the 60% region and\nreject any sample that falls within the 30% region. Using\nthe remaining samples we can compute the contribution to\nthe NRMC integral from that interval.\nThe left panel of Figure 22 shows the contributions\nfrom the individual intervals for 5 repeats of the NRMC\n\n\f14\n\nP.

The right panel shows\nthe summation of the individual contributions versus the\nvolume of the credible region. The credible region listed\nas 9995% is defined as follows. Let XU 99 and XL99 correspond to the upper and lower boundaries of the 99% credible region, respectively, for any of the parameters. Similarly, XU 95 and XL95 are the upper and lower boundaries of\nthe 95% credible region for the parameter. Then XU 9995 =\nXU 99 + (XU 99 \u2212 XU 95 ) and XL9995 = XL99 + (XL99 \u2212 XL95 ).\nSimilarly, XU 9984 = XU 99 + (XU 99 \u2212 XU 84 ).\nThe NRMC method is expected to underestimate the\nmarginal likelihood in higher dimensions and this underestimate is expected to become worse the larger the number of model parameters, i.e. increasing number of planets\n(Gregory 2007c). When we conclude, as we do, that the\nNRMC computed odds in favor of the five planet model\ncompared to the four planet model is \u223c 102 we mean that\nthe true odds is > 102 . Thus the NRMC method is conservative. One indication of the break down of the NRMC\nmethod is the increased spread in the results for repeated\nevaluations.\nWe can readily convert the Bayes factors to a Bayesian\nFalse Alarm Probability (FAP) which we define in equation 12. For example, in the context of claiming the detec-\n\ntion of m planets the FAPm is the probability that there are\nactually fewer than m planets, i.e., m \u2212 1 or less.\nm\u22121\n\nFAPm =\n\nX\n\n(prob.of i planets)\n\n(12)\n\ni=0\n\nIf we assume a priori (absence of the data) that all models under consideration are equally likely, then probability\nof each model is related to the Bayes factors by\nBi4\np(Mi | D, I) = PN\nB\nj=0 j4\n\n(13)\n\nwhere N is the maximum number of planets in the hypothesis space under consideration, and of course B44 = 1. For\nthe purpose of computing FAPm we set N = m.

The\nBayesian false alarm probabilities for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6\nplanet models are given in the fourth column of Table 2.\nTable 2 gives the NMRC Marginal likelihood estimates,\nBayes factors and false alarm probabilities for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\n\fBayesian Re-analysis of the Gliese 581 Exoplanet System\nand 6 planet models which are designated M0 , * * * , M6 . The\nlast two columns list the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the extra noise parameter, s, and the RMS residual.\nFor each model the NRMC calculation was repeated 5 times\nand the quoted errors give the spread in the results, not the\nstandard deviation. The Bayes factors that appear in the\nthird column are all calculated relative to model 4.\nA summary of the 5 planet model parameters and their\nuncertainties are given in Table 3. The quoted value is\nthe median of the marginal probability distribution for the\nparameter in question (except eccentricity which uses the\nmode) and the error bars identify the boundaries of the\n68.3% credible region 5 . The value immediately below in\nparenthesis is the MAP estimate, the value at the maximum of the joint posterior probability distribution. It is not\nuncommon for the MAP estimate to fall close to the borders of the credible region. In one case, the eccentricity of\nthe fifth planet, the MAP estimate falls well outside the\n68.3% credible region which is one reason why we prefer to\nquote median or mode values as well. The semi-major axis\nand M sin i values are derived from the model parameters\nassuming a stellar mass of 0.31 \u00b1 0.02 M\u2299 (Delfosse et al.\n2000). The quoted errors on the semi-major axis and M sin i\ninclude the uncertainty in the stellar mass.\nAlthough the NRMC estimate of the Bayes factor for\nthe 6 planet model is much lower than for either the 4 or\n5 planet models we can still infer the orbital parameters of\nthe most probable additional planetary signal in the 6 planet\nfit.

Panel\n(b) shows a blow-up of a portion of the mean 4 planet model\nfit compared to the data, and panel (c) shows the residuals.\nThe same reference time was used for the combined data set\nas for the HARPS only data. The HIRES data (Vogt et al.\n2010) consisted of 122 velocity measurements spanning a\nrange of 11 years and with quoted errors ranging from 0.53\nto 4.82 m s\u22121 . Figure 24 shows a comparison of the velocity\ndifferences (HIRES-HARPS) for the nearest pairs of samples\nversus the sample time difference. A cluster of 10 points with\nsample time differences between 0.2 and 0.3s is indicated by\nthe ellipse. Since these time differences are small compared\nwith the shortest known orbital period of 3.15 days, they\nprovide an indication of the agreement between the two sets\n\n5\n\nIn practice, the probability density for any parameter is represented by a finite list of values pi representing the probability in\ndiscrete intervals \u03b4X. A simple way to compute the 68.3% credible region, in the case of a marginal with a single peak, is to sort\nthe pi values in descending order and then sum the values until\nthey approximate 68.3%, keeping track of the upper and lower\nboundaries of this region as the summation proceeds.\n\nFigure 23.

One possibility is that the quoted HIRES errors have\nbeen systematically under-estimated which we can model\nby an extra Gaussian noise term added in quadrature to\nthe quoted HIRES errors with a \u03c3 = dsHIRES .

The other panels correspond\nto phase plot for the other three periods. Examination of the\n66.9d period phase plot indicates that the HIRES data do\nnot lend much support to the 66.9 day period. In fact around\na phase of 0.8 there are a series of \u223c 11 points that exhibit\na systematic trend away from the mean light curve. To examine this further we carried out a one planet FMCMC fit\nto the HIRES residuals after subtracting off the 3.15, 5.37,\nand 12.9d mean orbits. Figure 40 shows the one planet Kepler periodogram of these residuals. Three prominent peaks\nare present at 26.3, 65.6, and 73d along with many minor\npeaks.

An alternative possibility that we can test is that\nthe HIRES data are systematically too low by a common\nfactor. To check this out we re-did the four planet analysis\nof the combined HIRES/HARPS data using the following\nnoise model.\n\u03c3HIRESj =\n\nq\n\n(bHIRES \u00d7 \u03c3quotedj )2 + s2\n\n(24)\n\nWe assumed a uniform prior for the unknown parameter\nbHIRES in the range 0.5 to 4.0. The results were qualitatively very similar to the results obtained with dsHIRES noise\nterm. Following similar calculations to those outlined in Section 6.5 we computed the reduced \u03c72 of the residuals divided by the total effective noise \u03c3 and obtained a value of\n1.009, indistinguishable from the reduced \u03c72 obtained using the dsHIRES parameter.

Figure 45 shows a\nsimilar plot for the bHIRES parameterization. Ideally the \u03c72\ndistribution would be flat with a value of 1.0. It is clear that\nthe dsHIRES parameterization achieves a flatter distribution\nthan the bHIRES parameterization.

Employing the\nbHIRES parameterization results in a significantly larger estimate in the s term than was required by the HARPS only\nanalysis or the dsHIRES parameterization of the combined\nHIRES/HARPS data.\nAlthough the two different parameterizations of the\nHIRES extra noise lead to similar values of the reduced \u03c72\nwe can gain additional insight about which parameterization\nis better from a more microscopic exploration by binning the\n4 planet fit residuals/(effective noise) and examining the \u03c72\nvalues of the individual bins.

We suspect this extra noise term may arise from\nan as yet unidentified systematics which may be the reason\nfor the degradation in the quality of fits beyond three planets. Alternatively, could unidentified HARPS systematics be\nresponsible for the extra periods evident in their lower noise\ndata?\n\n8\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nA Bayesian re-analysis of published HARPS and HIRES\nprecision radial velocity data for Gl 581 was carried out\nwith a multi-planet Kepler periodogram (from 1 to 6 planets) based on our fusion Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. In all cases the analysis included an unknown pa-\n\n\fBayesian Re-analysis of the Gliese 581 Exoplanet System\nrameterized stellar jitter noise term. For the HARPS data\nset the most probable number of planetary signals detected\nis 5. The Bayesian false alarm probability for the 5 planet\nmodel is 0.01. These include the 3.15, 5.37, 12.9, 66.9d periods reported previously plus a 399+14\n\u221216 d period. The orbits of 4 of the 5 planets are consistent with low eccentricity orbits, the exception being the 66.9d orbit where\ne = 0.33+0.09\n\u22120.10 . The semi-major axis and M sini of the 5 planets are (0.0285 \u00b1 0.0006 au, 1.91+0.26\n\u22120.25 M\u2295 ), (0.0406 \u00b1 0.0009\nau, 15.7+0.7\n\u22120.7 M\u2295 ), (0.0730 \u00b1 0.0016 au, 5.29 \u00b1 0.43M\u2295 ),\n(0.218 \u00b1 0.005 au, 6.7 \u00b1 0.8M\u2295 ), and (0.72 \u00b1 0.24 au,\n6.6+2.0\n\u22122.7 M\u2295 ), respectively.\nIn light of the Vogt et al. (2010) report of a sixth companion with a period of 36.6d, we carried out a 6 planet fit\nto the HARPS data which detected multiple period possibilities. The strongest of these, with a period = 34.4\u00b10.1d and\neccentricity of 0.49+0.22\n\u22120.17 , had a peak Log10 [Prior \u00d7 Likelihood] 100 times larger than the others. The inferred semimajor axis and M sini are (0.140 \u00b1 0.003 au, 2.3+0.8\n\u22120.7 M\u2295 ).\nThe Bayesian false alarm probability for the six planet model\nis extremely large 0.999978 so we are unable to support any\nclaim for a sixth companion on the basis of the current data.\nThe analysis of the HIRES data set yielded a reliable\ndetection of only the strongest 5.37 and 12.9 day periods.\nThe analysis of the combined HIRES/HARPS data again\nonly reliably detected the 5.37 and 12.9d periods. Detection\nof 4 planetary signals with periods of 3.15, 5.37, 12.9, and\n66.9d was only achieved by including an additional unknown\nbut parameterized Gaussian error term added in quadrature\nto the HIRES quoted errors. The marginal probability density of the sigma for this additional HIRES Gaussian noise\n\u22121\n. Phase plots\nterm has a well defined peak at 1.84+0.35\n\u22120.33 m s\nindicate that incorporating the HIRES data seems to degrade the evidence for the 66.9 and \u223c 400d periods even\nwhen we allow for the extra HIRES noise term. We suspect\nthis extra noise term may arise from unidentified systematics\nwhich may be the reason for the degradation in the quality\nof fits beyond three planets. Alternatively, could unidentified HARPS systematics be responsible for the extra periods\nevident in their lower noise data? Independent experimental\nconfirmation of the HARPS low noise level results would be\nvery desirable.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe author would like to thank Wolfram Research for providing a complementary license to run gridMathematica.\n\nREFERENCES\nTer Braak, C.
