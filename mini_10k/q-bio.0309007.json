According\nto Kim and Prohofsky, [2], [3], the latter includes the two domains, which correspond with\ndifferent degrees of freedom of the molecule: (1) acoustic modes, which do not involve the\nhydrogen bonds; (2) modes that stretch the hydrogen bonds between the base-pairs (the\nHBS modes). Local minimum of the frequency is characteristic for the HBS-modes, [2], [3];\nits position depending on the choice of the band. The vibrations of the DNA were observed in\nthe low-frequency Raman scattering, [4], [5], and the Fourier-transform infra-red absorption\nexperiments, [6], to a large extent depending on the state and composition of solvent. But,\nthe experimental data, [1], is not conclusive as to the relative positions of the TA- and\nHBS-modes. If the acoustic torsional bands interpenetrate the HBS-modes, the torsional\nvibrations of the double helix could change periodically the elastic constants of inter-strand\nmotions, and thus provide a supply of energy for the HBS-modes. Then a torsional acoustic\nband, which has the double frequency with respect to that of the HBS-mode, could provide\na means for maintaining an HBS-mode through the parametric resonance.\n\nII.\n\nTHE ELASTIC DYNAMICS OF TORSIONAL AND INTER-STRAND MODES\n\nWhile considering the dynamics of the DNA one has to take into account: (1) the DNA\nhaving the two strands; (2) the base-pairs being linked by the hydrogen bonds; (3) the helical\nsymmetry. We shall utilize a one-dimensional lattice model for the elastic properties of the\nDNA which accommodates these requirements.\nEl Hasan and Calladine, [7], set up the scheme for the internal geometry of the double\nhelix of the DNA, which describes the relative position of one base with respect to the other\nin a Watson-Crick base-pair and also the positions of the two base-pairs. This is achieved by\nintroducing local frames, or triads, for the bases and the base-pairs, and translation-slides\nalong their long axes. We follow the guidelines of paper [7], but aiming at a qualitative\ndescription of the DNA dynamics use a simplified set of variables. We shall describe the\nrelative position of the bases of a base-pair by means of the vector Y~ directed along the long\naxis ( y\u2212 axis of paper [7], see also paper [8]); Y~ being equal to zero when the base-pair is\n\n2\n\n\fat equilibrium. Thus, Y~ describes the base-base stretch corresponding to the displacement\nof the two-bases that make up the base-pair away from each other along the long axis y, [9].\nThe relative position of the base-pairs are described by the torsional angles \u03c6n , which give\ndeviations from the standard equilibrium twist of the double helix. Thus a twist of the DNA\nmolecule, which does not involve inter-strand motion or mutual displacements of the bases\ninside the pairs, is determined by the torsional angles \u03c6n that are the angles of rotation of\nthe base-pairs about the axis of the double-helix. The twist energy of the molecule is given\nby the equation\nH\u03c6 =\n\nX \u0014I\nn\n\n2\n\n\u03c6\u03072n +\n\n\u03c4\n(\u03c6n+1 \u2212 \u03c6n )2\n2a2\n\n\u0015\n\nin which I is the moment of inertia, and \u03c4 and \u03ba are the twist coefficients, which for the sake\nof simplicity and taking into account the qualitative picture at which we aim, are assumed\nthe same for all the base-pairs.\nInterstrand motions should correspond to the relative motion of the bases inside the\nbase-pairs, therefore the kinetic energy due to this degree of freedom may be cast in the\nform\nX\nn\n\nM ~ \u0307 2\nY\n2 n\n\nwhere M is the effective mass of a couple. For each base-pair we have the reference frame in\nwhich (1) z-axis corresponds to the axis of the double helix, (2) y-axis to the long axis of the\nbase-pair, (3) x-axis perpendicular to z- and y- axes (see Fig. 1 of paper [7]). At equilibrium\nthe change in position of adjacent base-pairs is determined only by the twist angle \u03a9 of the\ndouble helix. We shall assume \u03a9 = 2\u03c0/10 as for the B-form of DNA. To determine the\nenergy due to the inter-strand displacements we need to find the strain taking into account\nthe constraint imposed by the helical structure of our system. For this end one may utilize\nthe covariant derivative, as is done in paper [11], but a simpler approach is possible.\nLet us confine ourself only to the torsional degrees of freedom of the double lattice and\nassume the vectors Y~n being parallel to x-y plane, or two-dimensional. Consider the displacements Y~n , Y~n+1 for the two consecutive base-pairs, n, n+1. Since we must compare\nthe two vectors in the same frame, we shall rotate the vector Y~n+1 to the frame of the n-th\nbase pair,\nback\n~n+1\nY~n+1\n= R\u22121 (\u03c6) Y\n\nHere R\u22121 (\u03c6) is the inverse matrix of the rotation of the n-th frame to the (n+1)-one given\n3\n\n\fby the equation\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8ef cos \u03c6 \u2212 sin \u03c6 \uf8fa\n\nR(\u03c6) = \uf8f0\n\nsin \u03c6 cos \u03c6\n\n(1)\n\n\uf8fb\n\nThe matrix R is 2 by 2 since the vectors Y~n are effectively two-dimensional. Then the strain\ncaused by the displacements of the base-pairs is determined by the difference\nback\nY~n+1\n\u2212 Y~n\n\nFor this argument I am indebted to D.I.Tchertov.\nIt is important that the angle \u03c6 is given by the twist angle, \u03a9, describing the double\nhelix, in conjunction with the torsional angles \u03c6n , so that\n\u03c6 = \u03a9 + \u03c6n+1 \u2212 \u03c6n\nTherefore, the energy HY due to the base-base stretch, or the inter-strand stress, reads\n(\n\n)\n\ni2\nM ~ \u0307 2\n\u01eb\nK h\nHY =\nYn + 2 R\u22121 (\u03a9 + \u03c6n+1 \u2212 \u03c6n ) Y~n+1 \u2212 Y~n + Y~n2\n2\n2a\n2\nn\nin which K and a are the torsional elastic constant and the inter-pairs distance, correX\n\nspondingly. In summations given above n is the number of a site corresponding to the n-th\nbase-pair, and n = 1, 2, . . . , N, N being the number of pairs in the segment of the DNA\nunder consideration. The constant K is assumed to be the same for all the base-pairs. In\nfact, it differs from the situation in real life, but we are aiming at a rough qualitative picture.\nBesides it is possible to manufacture artificial double helices of the form (polyX).(polyY ),\nin which the elastic constants shall not depend on the choice of the base-pair. The last\nterm, \u01eb/2 Y~ 2 accommodates the energy of the inter-strand separation due to the slides of the\nbases inside the base-pairs. The form of HY corresponds with the fact that the equilibrium\nposition of the double helix is the twisted one determined by \u03a9, all \u03c6n being equal to zero.\nWe suppose that the size of DNA molecule is small enough that it can be visualized as a\nstraight double helix, that is not larger than the persistence length. Hence the number of\nbase-pairs, N \u2264 150, approximately. The total energy Helastic of the DNA molecule reads\nHelastic = H\u03c6 + HY\n\n(2)\n\nPreserving only terms up to the third order in \u03c6n , and Y~n , we may transform Helastic\ngiven by Eq.(2), so that it takes on the form\nHelastic =\n\nX \u0014I\nn\n\n2\n\n\u03c6\u03072n +\n4\n\n\u03c4\n(\u03c6n+1 \u2212 \u03c6n )2\n2a2\n\n\u0015\n\n\f+\n\nX\nn\n\n(\n\ni2\n\u01eb\nM ~ \u0307 2\nK h\nYn + 2 R\u22121 (\u03a9) Y~n+1 \u2212 Y~n + Y~n2\n2\n2a\n2\n\n)\n\nh\ni\nKX\n+ 2\n(\u03c6n+1 \u2212 \u03c6n ) R\u22121 (\u03a9) Y~n+1 \u00d7 Y~n\n3\na n\n\n(3)\n\nWe have used the fact that the axis of the double-helix is directed along Oz-axis.\nLet us simplify the equation for Helastic with the help of the unitary transformation\n1\nYn2 = \u221a (iu1n + u2n )\n2\n\n1\nYn1 = \u221a (u1n + iu2n ),\n2\n\nNote that the vectors Y~n and ~un are effectively two-dimensional, their third coordinates\nbeing equal to zero.

The essential point is the effects of dissipation,\nwhich are due to ions in the close neighborhood of the molecule and water effects, see [12].\nThe dissipation can be accommodated by writing down terms linear in u\u0307\u03b1q , \u03c6\u0307q . We shall take\ninto account external force, or torque Tq , only in the equation for \u03c6q , for it corresponds to\n5\n\n\fexternal degrees of freedom of our model. Thus, the equations of motion can be cast in the\nform\n\u00fc\u03b1q + \u03c9\u03b12 q u\u03b1q + \u03b3u u\u0307\u03b1q\n4K sin \u03a9 X \u2212iaq\u2032\n\u221a\n+\ne\n\u03c6q\u2032 u\u03b1q\u2212q\u2032 = 0,\n2\nMa N q\u2032\n\n(6)\n\n\u03c6\u0308q + \u03c9q2 \u03c6q + \u03b3\u03c6 \u03c6\u0307q\n+ i\n\n4K sin \u03a9 eiaq X 1 2\n\u221a\nuq\u2032 uq\u2212q\u2032 = Tq\nIa2 N\n\u2032\nq\n\n(7)\n\nin which the dispersion laws for the fields u\u03b1q , \u03b1 = 1, 2, and \u03c6q are given by the equations\n\u03b1\n\u01eb\n4K\n2 \u03a9 + (\u22121) aq\nsin\n+\n,\n2\nMa\n2\nM\n4\u03c4\naq\n\u03c9q2 =\nsin2\n2\nIa\n2\n\n2\n\u03c9\u03b1q\n=\n\n(8)\n(9)\n\nWe see that the spectrum of \u03c6q has a typical acoustic character, whereas that for u\u03b1q has\na local minimum determined by the helical twist, \u03a9. Thus, the spectrum of our model\nis in qualitative agreement with conclusions of [2], [3]. The nature of the torque is to be\nspecified elsewhere (see Section III). For the moment, we shall consider general dynamical\nphenomena to which the torque may be conducive.\nLet us suppose that for one thing the amplitudes of the HBS-modes given by u\u03b1q be\nso small that the quadratic term in Eq.(7) can be neglected, and for another the external\ntorque Tq be appreciable enough to maintain the vibration of the torsional mode \u03c6q . Thus,\n\nwe can visualize the latter as a pump mode that interacts with the HBS-mode u\u03b1q through\n\nthe non-linearity in Eq.(6). Since we aim at studying the problem of mw-radiation (see\nnext section), we shall confine ourself to the case of the torque Tq being non-zero only at\nq = q\u2217 = \u03a9/a, and having the frequency 2\u03c9. Therefore, the forced wave, or the pump wave\nfor the HBS-mode, has the form\n\u03c6q\u2217 = ei2\u03c9t \u03a6 \u03b4qq\u2217 ,\n\n\u03c6\u2212q\u2217 = e\u2212i2\u03c9t \u03a6\u2217 \u03b4\u2212qq\u2217\n\nTo obtain larger values for the pump wave, \u03c6q , the resonance condition\n\u03c9q\u2217 = 2\u03c9\nshould be verified. The equations of motion for u\u03b1q in the pumping regime read\n6\n\n(10)\n\n\f2\n\u00fc\u03b1q + \u03c9\u03b1q\nu\u03b1q + \u03b3u u\u0307\u03b1q +\n\n\u0011\n2K sin \u03a9 \u0010 i2\u03c9t \u03b1\n\u2217 \u2212i2\u03c9t \u03b1\n\u221a\nA\ne\nu\n+\nA\ne\nu\nq\u2212q\u2217\nq+q\u2217 = 0\nMa2 N\n\nhere\nA = e\u2212i\u03a9 \u03a6\nNote that the momentum conservation in the q-values is preserved, as required by the threewave interaction.

The key point is accommodating the fact that the wavelength\nof radiation is by many orders of magnitudes larger than the characteristic size of the region\nof the molecule involved in the process. It was Chun-Ting Zhang, [13], who suggested a\nmechanism to overcome this difficulty. The main point of Zhang's argument is that the\nhelical configuration of the electric dipoles corresponding with the base-pairs makes the\n~ of the dipole P~ and the field E\n~ dependent on angle, and therefore,\ninteraction U = \u2212P~ * E\ndifferent torsional momenta are applied at the base-pairs. For our model the equation for\nthe energy of interaction between the dipoles of DNA and an incident micro-wave reads\n\u2212\n\nX\nn\n\n~ * R(n\u03a9 + \u03c6n )P~o\nE\n\nHere R(n\u03a9 + \u03c6n ) is the rotation matrix given by Eq.(1), and P~o is the dipole at site n = 0.\nConsequently, even though at the molecular scale the radiation has a plane wave configuration, it still twists the DNA molecule about the axis of the double-helix. Since the momenta\nchanges periodically in time with the incident wave, the irradiation results in a periodic\nstress that may produce elastic vibrations in the DNA molecule. Zhang suggested that the\nforce may generate resonance vibrations, resulting in a cross-over mechanism which takes\nup initial torsion excitations and transforms them into longitudinal acoustic vibrations.\n8\n\n\fIn the present paper we will try to combine Zhang's mechanism, [13], and the excitations\nof the double-helix studied by Prohofsky and Kim, [2], [3], with the view of generating interstrand waves in the DNA by mw-irradiation. In contrast to the original idea by Zhang, we\ndo not utilize a cross-over into longitudinal acoustic vibrations, but employ the interaction\nbetween torsional oscillations and the inter-strand ones, i.e. the three-wave, given by Eq.(4).\nThe main point is that by expanding the rotation matrix R(n\u03a9 + \u03c6n ) in the angles \u03c6n\nand keeping only the first order terms, we may cast Zhang's interaction in the form\nHZ = \u2212\n\nX\nn\n\n~ \u00d7 P~n )3 + const,\n\u03c6 n (E\n\nP~n = R(n\u03a9) P~o\n\n(16)\n\nin which P~o is the dipole vector at site n = 0. Next, by using Eq.(1) for the matrix R(n\u03a9)\nand neglecting the constant term we may cast Eq.(16) in the form\n\nHZ =\n\nn\no\n1X\n~ \u00d7 P~o )3 \u2212 i(E\n~ * P~o )] + e\u2212in\u03a9 [(E\n~ \u00d7 P~o )3 + i(E\n~ * P~o )]\n\u03c6n ein\u03a9 [(E\n2 n\n\nOn applying the Fourier transform for the \u03c6n , and utilizing the equation\n1 X i(\u03a9\u00b1aq)n\ne\n= \u03b4\u03a9,\u00b1aq\nN n\nwe obtain the following expression for Zhang's interaction\n\nHZ =\n\n\u221a\n\no\nNn\n~ \u00d7 P~o )3 \u2212 i(E\n~ * P~o )] + \u03c6\n~\n~\n~ ~\n\u03a9 [(E \u00d7 Po )3 + i(E * Po )]\n\u03c6q= \u03a9 [(E\nq=\u2212\na\na\n2\n\nHence, the torque Tq in Eq.(7) corresponding to HZ is given by the equation\nT =\n\nZ\u2217\nZ\n\u03b4q,\u2212q\u2217 +\n\u03b4q,q\u2217\nI\nI\n\nin which\nZ=\n\nq\u2217 = \u03a9/a\n\n(17)\n\n\u221a\n\ni\nN h ~\n~ * P~o )\n(E \u00d7 P~o )3 + i(E\n2\n\nIt should be noted that \u00b1q\u2217 are the local minima of the HBS-modes; qres given by Eq.(14)\nreads\nqres =\n\n3\nq\u2217\n2\n\n(18)\n\nIt is worth noting that the wave numbers q\u2217 and qres correspond to the wavelengths of one\nand\n\n2\n3\n\nturns of the double-helix.\n\n9\n\n\fEquations given above provide an opportunity for making numerical, order of magnitude,\nestimates, which enable us to assess the effect of mw-radiation on the HBS-modes. From\nEq.(17) we infer that the torque T has the size\n\u221a\n\nN\nEP\nI\n\nT \u221d e2i\u03c9t\n\nwhere E and P are the external field and the dipole moment of the base-pair, respectfully.\nNext, suppose that the resonance condition\n\u03c9q = 2\u03c9,\n\nq = q\u2217 =\n\n\u03a9\na\n\nbe true, so that there is the resonance of the incident mw-radiation and the acoustic torsional\nmode \u03c6q\u2217 . Therefore, we may expect that the action of the radiation on the torsional modes\nshould be the largest possible. Then the amplitude of the pumping wave, \u03c6q\u2217 , according to\nEq.(7), is of the order\n\u03a6\u221d\n\n\u221a\n\nN EP\nI 2\u03c9\u03b3\u03c6\n\n(19)\n\nNext, we turn to Rayleigh's condition for the parametric resonance of the HBS-mode given\nby Eq.(15). For the pumping wave corresponding to Eq.(19), it gives\n2\n\n(\u03c9 \u2212\n\n2\n)2\n\u03c9\u03b1q\n\u2217\n\n+\n\n\u03b3u2\n\nK sin \u03a9 EP\n\u03c9 \u22484\nMa2 I\u03b3\u03c6 \u03c9\n2\n\n!2\n\nHence we have the threshold condition\n\u03b3u \u03b3\u03c6 \u2264\n\n2K sin \u03a9 EP\nMa2 \u03c9 2 I\n\n(20)\n\nWe suppose that the frequency of the HBS-modes be determined by the first term in Eq.(8),\nso that the first factor in Eq.(20) does not differ much from unity. It signifies that the\nenergies of the inter-strand separation per base-pair is approximately of the same order as\nthat due to the twist of the relative positions of the two adjacent base-pairs. If so, we could\nhave the estimate for the dissipative constants, at least by orders of magnitude,\n\u03b3u \u03b3\u03c6 \u2264\n\nEP\nI\n\nOn utilizing the expression\n~ \u00d7 H,\n~\n~= c E\nS\n4\u03c0\n10\n\n(21)\n\n\ffor Pointing's vector, we cast the estimate given by Eq.(21) in the form\nP\n\u03b3u \u03b3\u03c6 \u2264 2\nI\n\ns\n\n\u03c0S\nc\n\n(22)\n\nin which S is the power density of the interaction and c the light velocity.

It should\nbe noted that the crucial point in assessing the feasibility of experiments on mw-irradiation\nof the DNA, and its possible influence, is the part played by ions in ambient solvent. In\nfact, the irradiation may result in just heating the solvent, so that the dissipation due to\nthe ions takes up all effects on the molecules of DNA. Generally, the thin boundary layer of\nwater and ions close to the DNA-molecule may have an important bearing on the dynamics\ninitiated by the incident mw-radiation and result in the overdamping of the molecule's\ntorsional oscillations. Davis and VanZhandt, [12], put forward arguments that nonetheless\nthe influence of the boundary layer could be effectively small so as to allow the survival of\nthe effect caused by the mw-irradiation. But, so far there have been no definite arguments\nin this respect, and studying the mw-effect may turn out to be helpful for its understanding.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS : IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DNA BIOPHYSICS\n\nThe elastic dynamics of the double helix could have enough structure for providing a\nmeans for stretching the hydrogen bonds of the base-pairs of DNA, or generating the HBSmodes. If the vibrational modes of the DNA are not overdamped by the ambient solvent, and\nthe balance between energies supplied and dissipated is favorable, the \"optimistic\" forecast\nis that sufficiently developed resonance instabilities could bring about the breaking of the\nrelatively weak H-bonds ( with free energy of less than 2kB T , see [14]), and even result in\nthe denaturation of the molecule. On the contrary, if the dissipation is strong, which is quite\nlikely, the maintenance of the HBS-modes could be expected only at the edge of the HBSzone and for sufficiently strong pumping. It is important that in the range of frequencies less\n11\n\n\fthan 10GHz, the absorption due to water is small, whereas close to 100GHz the permitivity\nof water changes drastically.\nThe best technique for studying the H-bond stretching still remains the Raman spectroscopy on which certain improvements have been made (see [15] and references therein).\nThe choice of specific means for generating torsional excitations of the DNA is important\nand interesting. In this paper we have envisaged mw-irradiation of the DNA. In case the\ninterpenetration of the acoustic and the HBS-modes takes place, we come to the conclusion\nthat mw-radiation could maintain the HBS-modes, if the power density is sufficiently large,\n100 mW/cm2 or more. It is important that there is no need for long exposures of the sample\nto the radiation. Thus, the double helix could be a kind of mw-parametric amplifier for\nthe HBS-modes, which are always present due to heat fluctuations; the torsional vibrations\nserving a pump beam for the HBS-modes. It is worthwhile to take into account that the\nparametric resonance can take place also for the frequencies p of the pumping wave that\nverify the equation p = 2\u03c9/n, n = 1, 2, 3 . . .. Therefore, the constraint imposed on the\nfrequencies of the AT- and HBS-modes is less stringent than it appears at first sight. If\nthe effect be sufficiently pronounced, it may result in the formation of the bubbles of broken H-bonds. In this respect it is worth noting that our estimate for the critical power\ndensity, 100 mW/cm2 , is by orders of magnitude larger than that officially prescribed, i.e.\n0.2 \u2212 1 mW/cm2 .\nThe whole range of problems related to the direct action of mw-radiation on the DNA\nis highly controversial (see H. Lai's discussion of the subject, [16]). For one thing there\nis enough evidence for the conclusion that it has a bearing upon the functioning of living\norganisms; for another, \"micro-wave\" effect, considered as the resonance absorption of radiation, is difficult to distinguish from accompanying phenomena, for example heating, as\nwell as to assess its real implications. In this respect utilizing the HBS-mode, which can\nbe maintained by short pulses of radiation and detected and registered by the experimental\nmethods currently employed in condensed matter physics, could be a valuable probe into\nthe action of mw-irradiation on the DNA molecule.\n\n12\n\n\fAcknowledgments\n\nI am thankful to G.Bonnet and J.SantaLucia for the useful communications, and\nYu.S.Volkov and D.I.Tchertov for the discussions.\n\n[1] E.B.Starikov, Physics Reports, 284, 1 (1997).\n[2] Y.Kim and E.W.Prohofsky, Phys.Rev.
