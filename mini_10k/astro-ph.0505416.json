An intermediate product of this extinction\nanalysis is the measurement of new H2 abundances in the Magellanic Clouds.\nCollectively considering Cloud sight lines that possess significant H2 column densities, E(B \u2212V )/N(H I) ratios are reduced by significant factors relative to the\nGalactic mean, whereas the corresponding E(B \u2212V )/N(H2 ) values more closely\nresemble their Galactic counterpart. These trends reflect the fact that among\nthese sight lines f (H2 )-values are lower than those common in the Milky Way for\npaths with similar degrees of reddening.\nSubject headings: ISM: abundances - ultraviolet: ISM\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAn important step toward a complete understanding of the formation, structure, and\ncomposition of interstellar dust is the study and discrimination of factors that produce\nchanges in the observed wavelength-dependent extinction of stars due to grains. The Large\nand Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC, respectively) are metal-poor relative to the\nGalaxy; recent estimates imply that the LMC and SMC have overall metallicities at levels\n0.5 and 0.2\u20130.25, respectively, of the Galactic ISM (Welty et al. 2001). Dust-to-gas ratios\ndetermined for these galaxies, as represented by E(B \u2212V )/N(H I), are also reduced (by\nfactors of about 4 and 10; Bouchet et al. 1985; Fitzpatrick 1986), indicating that LMC and\nSMC dust components and their formation mechanisms are not inconsistent with Galactic\ncomponents and mechanisms. Nevertheless, there are differences in extinction among these\nthree galaxies.\nEarly investigations of the extinction properties of Magellanic Cloud dust identified\nseveral sight lines that exhibited marked differences from curves produced by grains in the\nMilky Way (e.g., Nandy et al. 1980; Koornneef & Code 1981; Rocca-Volmerange et al. 1981).\n1\n\nBased on observations with the NASA-CNES-CSA Far-Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer, which is operated for NASA by the Johns Hopkins University under NASA contract NAS-32985.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nIt was noted in comparing these curves that the 2175 \u00c5 bump strength was reduced in the\nLMC relative to the Galaxy, and somewhat further diminished for curves characteristic of\nthe SMC. Similarly, the FUV rise evident in LMC and SMC extinction curves is stronger\nthan that common in the Galaxy. Subsequent studies have identified regional variation in\nMagellanic Cloud curves, associating a distinctive LMC wavelength dependence with the\nsupershell LMC2 (Misselt, Clayton, & Gordon 1999), a steeper UV curve with the starforming bar region of the SMC, and extinction more closely resembling Galactic curves with\nother portions of the Clouds. Recently, Gordon et al. (2003) (hereafter G03) completed a\ncomprehensive comparison of Galactic, LMC, and SMC extinction curves from near-infrared\n\u22121\nto ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths (\u03bb >\n\u223c 8.7\u03bcm ); G03 confirmed that\n\u223c 1150 \u00c5 or 1/\u03bb <\ncurves characteristic of the LMC2 grouping and the SMC bar do not conform to the Cardelli,\nClayton, & Mathis (1989) (CCM) parameterization of Galactic extinction based on RV [\u2261\nA(V )/E(B \u2212V )].\nThe strength of their UV extinction is a key feature distinguishing LMC, SMC, and\nGalactic curves; in particular, the steeper short-wavelength slopes associated with Magellanic Cloud extinction curves can be diagnostic of differences in dust compositions and grain\nsize distributions, given appropriate measures of elemental abundances in their respective\ninterstellar media (Draine 2003). However, the extension of Magellanic Cloud extinction\ncurves into the FUV (> 8.7 \u03bcm\u22121 ) is complicated by the requirement that interstellar H2\nabsorption be removed from the spectra before an extinction curve can be produced using the pair method. Previous efforts in this area, even for Milky Way sight lines, have\nbeen hampered by a lack of high quality data. In particular, instrumental issues of scattered\nlight, time-variable sensitivity, and a limited sample (both target and comparison objects) restricted the utility of the Copernicus dataset (cf. Jenkins et al. 1986; Snow, Allen, & Polidan\n1990), the Voyager UVS data suffer from low resolution which prevents explicit identification\nand removal of the molecular hydrogen contribution, and the remaining available data [e.g.,\nrocket - Green et al. 1992; Lewis, Cook, & Chakrabarti 2005; Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope\n(HUT) - Buss et al. 1994; Orbiting Retrievable Far and Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer\n(ORFEUS) - Sasseen et al. 2002] include only a few Galactic sight lines. Far Ultraviolet\nSpectroscopic Explorer (FUSE), however, has revolutionized our ability to study interstellar\nmolecular hydrogen. Its combination of slightly better spectral resolution and much greater\ndetector sensitivity than Copernicus allows H2 to be detected throughout much larger and\nmore diverse portions of the Galaxy and even in the Magellanic Clouds (Shull et al. 2000;\nRachford et al. 2002; Tumlinson et al. 2002). Thus, FUSE data are uniquely suited to investigating the FUV extinction properties of Milky Way, LMC, and SMC sight lines and what\nany differences reveal about the dust populations in each galaxy.\nRecently, Clayton et al. (2003) used a modified maximum entropy method (MEM) to\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nfit extinction components to IR through UV curves for stars both in the Galaxy and in the\nClouds; they demonstrated that the average SMC bar extinction curve was best fit using a\ngrain distribution in which small silicate and amorphous carbon grains play a much larger\nrole than in the mean Galactic extinction. However, this result is at odds with Welty et\nal. (2001), whose data suggested negligible silicon depletion in several gas cloud components\nalong a sight line probing the SMC ISM. In order to address issues such as dust composition,\nparticularly for small grains enhancing FUV extinction in the Clouds, it would be helpful\nto explore LMC and SMC extinction curves shortward of the UV range that Clayton et al.\n(2003) were confined to by their International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) data; unfortunately,\nFUV extinction curves have been published to date for only very few reddened Magellanic\nCloud stars (Clayton et al. 1996; Hutchings & Giasson 2001).\nIn this paper, we construct new extinction curves for nine pairs of reddened and unreddened LMC and SMC stars by supplementing the IR through UV curves published by G03\nwith recent FUSE observations of 16 Magellanic Cloud targets. The FUSE data allow us to\nextend the Clayton et al. (2003) analysis of dust composition and grain size distribution to\nFUV wavelengths, where extinction is dominated by small grains and the differences between\nGalactic and Magellanic Cloud curves are particularly prominent. This is the second in a\nseries of three papers exploring extinction in the FUV. Paper I (Sofia et al. 2005) dealt with\na small set of Galactic extinction curves characterized by a broad range of RV -values; Paper\nIII (in preparation) will examine a much larger sample of Galactic sight lines in an effort to\nsearch rigorously for any trends among observed extinction parameters when FUV data are\nfully considered.\n\n2.\n\nObservations and Data Extraction\n\nThe present sample of 16 LMC and SMC stars includes all stars in the FUSE archive for\nwhich the spectral match between the reddened and unreddened stars has been rigorously\nevaluated and there exist spectral data from IR to UV wavelengths. Each reddened star\nhas previously been studied by G03; we use the same photometry sources and procedures to\nconstruct the IR to UV portions of the extinction curves for the pairs adopted in this study,\nwith the exception that early 2MASS photometry has been superseded in our analysis by\ndata from the recent All Sky Release. In particular, it should be noted that the RV values\nlisted in Table 1, which summarizes the properties of each extinction pair, differ slightly from\nthose published by G03 due to this update of the IR data. Consequently, the values of AV\nand N(H I)/AV in the table are also affected. The FUV portions of the extinction curves\n(shortward of the H I Ly\u03b1 line) were derived from the new and archival FUSE observations\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nlisted in Table 2. All of the raw data were processed using the latest release of CALFUSE\n(v3.0). The calibrated spectra for each channel were cross-correlated, shifted to a common\nwavelength scale, and combined based on exposure time in cases where several observations\nof a star existed. Also, in cases where the different observations or different FUSE channels\nproduced conflicting flux levels for a given wavelength (e.g., due to channel misalignment),\nthe data for these observations or channels were linearly adjusted to match the maximum\nobserved flux across the regions of overlap. General details on FUSE observations have\nbeen published by Sahnow et al. (2000a). We point out here, however, that each observation\nproduces eight spectra nearly 100 \u00c5 in length with individual dispersion characteristics. The\nLiF channel spectra (LiF1A, LiF1B, LiF2A, LiF2B) cover most wavelengths from 990\u20131190\n\u00c5 twice over; the spectral region from 910\u20131110 \u00c5 are similarly sampled by the SiC channels\n(SiC1A, SiC1B, SiC2A, SiC2B). Sample spectra of both poor and fine quality appear in\nFigure 1, using the data from the reddened star AzV 456 and its comparison star AzV 70,\nrespectively.\n\n2.1.\n\nMolecular Hydrogen Modelling and Removal\n\nStrong FUV H2 absorption bands can significantly alter the appearance of stellar spectra,\ndepending upon the column density of molecular gas along the line of sight. Consequently,\na molecular hydrogen model was constructed for each sight line using procedures patterned\ngenerally after those used by Rachford et al. (2001, 2002). The underlying assumption we\nmade in measuring the interstellar H2 for each sight line was that the model includes only\ntwo velocity components, one corresponding to Milky Way gas and one associated with H2 in\nthe appropriate Magellanic Cloud. The equivalent width measurements for distinct profiles\nof each component were entered into separate tables, so that molecular hydrogen measurements could be made individually for each galaxy using a curve-of-growth (CoG) analysis.\nUnfortunately, the velocity separation of Galactic and Magellanic Cloud components often\nresulted in blended absorption profiles at several points in a given spectrum. In general, the\nconstruction of a reasonable CoG for most of the sight lines required more equivalent width\nmeasurements than were available from the unblended and isolated H2 absorption lines. To\nremedy this problem, the profile-fitting code FITS6P2 and IRAF3 plotting routines were\n2\n\nThe FITS6P code models absorption profiles based on varying the column densities, b-values, and velocities of input interstellar components. More details on the algorithm can be found in Welty, Hobbs, & York\n(1991).\n3\n\nIRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories, which are operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nused in conjunction with our IDL4 code (Rachford et al. 2001, 2002) to deconvolve blended\nprofiles and fill out each CoG with as many measurements as could reliably be made. The\nCoG analysis, however, was generally limited to J \u2265 3 because the J \u2264 2 lines were saturated to the extent that they possessed broad damping wings that the equivalent width\nmeasurement algorithm could not reliably distinguish from the stellar continuum. Thus, an\niterative curve-fitting procedure was an additional requirement so that simultaneous determinations of Galactic and Magellanic Cloud column densities for these lower H2 rotational\nexcitation levels could be made. The complete molecular hydrogen models, including column densities for the available J levels, the associated b-value, and the derived kinetic and\nexcitation temperatures (these last properties are discussed in section 3.1), are summarized\nin Tables 3 and 4 for all of our LMC and SMC sight lines; Table 3 characterizes the Galactic\ncomponent for each sight line where one was detected, while Table 4 details the properties\nof each Magellanic Cloud component.\nOnce molecular hydrogen absorption models had been constructed, each spectrum was\ncorrected for this absorption. All of the FUSE data for each star were combined into a single\nspectrum by shifting the calibrated channel spectra to a common wavelength reference and\naveraging the fluxes, weighted by the flux uncertainty at each point in the overlapping\nregions. Although there are significant differences in the data dispersion properties for each\nchannel, the merged spectrum for each star is of sufficient quality for the construction of a\nreliable extinction curve. The \"worm\" problem in FUSE data (Sahnow et al. 2000b) was\nstrong only in LiF1B. Its appearance in the data for this detector segment was identified\nby a comparison with the LiF2A flux as the data for all detector segments were merged\ninto a single spectrum for each sight line; the portions of the LiF1B spectrum contaminated\nby the worm were eliminated from the merging process. A running cross-correlation of\nthe normalized H2 absorption profile corrected for any wavelength mismatches, and the\nfull final model was divided into the merged FUSE spectrum to complete the \"removal\" of\nthe molecular hydrogen features. Atomic hydrogen was not measured for each sight line\nindividually, but its signature, specifically the Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2 lines, was removed after the\nratio of the reddened and comparison spectra was calculated as a function of wavelength.\nAlthough FUSE spectra cover wavelengths from 905 through 1187 \u00c5, data shortward of 1044\n\u00c5 (our Ly\u03b2 cutoff) were not included in this analysis due to limitations in data quality.\nIn the interest of consistency in instrument response, FUSE flux levels were then manScience Foundation.\n4\n\nIDL is an acronym for Interactive Data Language, a common programming tool developed by Research\nSystems, Inc.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nually rescaled to match IUE fluxes over the wavelength range common to both instruments\n(1150 \u2212 1185 \u00c5) when the full IR to FUV spectra were constructed; given recent improvements to the calibration of IUE data (Massa & Fitzpatrick 2000), flux errors associated with\nthis instrument have not yet been surpassed by the latest FUSE calibration (Sahnow et al.\n2000a). Generally, mean fluxes for the data from each instrument agreed to within 20%,\nalthough there were a few targets for which the discrepancies exceeded this range. The scalings applied to each FUSE spectrum (the ratio of IUE to FUSE flux in the overlap region)\nare given in Table 5.\n\n2.2.\n\nThe Extinction Curves\n\nWe have constructed extinction curves using the pair method (e.g., Massa, Savage, &\nFitzpatrick 1983), normalized to A(V ) through RV ; the pairs of reddened and unreddened\nstars in the LMC and SMC were selected (G03) and are listed in Table 1. In an effort\nto minimize uncertainties in each extinction curve, particularly from spectral mismatch, a\ndetailed comparison of the FUSE spectrum for each star with similarly-typed unreddened\ncandidates was performed, and the extinction pairs matched by G03 using IUE were also\nfound to be well-matched in the FUV. Assembly of the extinction curve corresponding to\neach pair was accomplished using the same procedures and near-infrared through UV data\noutlined by G03. We have also constructed average extinction curves for the subsets of the\ncurrent sample associated with the LMCAvg and LMC2 regions considered previously in the\nUV (Misselt, Clayton, & Gordon 1999; G03). Each of the individual LMC curves and the\naverage curves have been fit to the Fitzpatrick & Massa (1990) parameterization; the results\nare presented in Table 6. The two sight lines in the SMC, one representing each of the bar\nand wing regions, are considered individually.\nA quick examination of the individual Magellanic Cloud extinction curves presented\nin Figure 2 reveals that the FUSE portion of each curve is generally consistent with an\nextension of the data from longer wavelengths. When the calibrated and H2 -adjusted fluxes\nwere initially compared, however, slight offsets were apparent between the portions of the\ncurve on either side of the Ly\u03b1 line. Comparing the size of the gaps in the Magellanic Cloud\ndata with the Galactic curves studied in Paper I led to the conclusion that the quality of the\ndata for our reddened stars might have compromised the accuracy of the extinction curve\nconstruction. In particular, the S/N of the FUSE data seemed to be inversely proportional\nto the size of the offset and there were noticeable flux level differences for some spectra\nbetween the IUE and the merged FUSE data in the spectral overlap region. The Galactic\nsight lines had much better S/N values, negligible offsets, and good agreement between IUE\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nand FUSE fluxes, whereas the Magellanic Cloud data suffered generally poor S/N, noticeable\noffsets, and sometimes poor flux agreement in the overlap. In order to reduce the offsets,\nthe FUSE data for the Cloud sight lines were linearly adjusted (a wavelength-independent\nmultiplicative factor was applied to the flux) over the entire FUV bandpass so that their\nfluxes matched IUE in the instruments' overlap region. An example of one of the more\negregious cases is plotted in Figure 3, including a comparison of the FUSE flux levels both\nbefore and after adjustment to the IUE flux level. The magnitude of each shift was estimated\nin increments of 0.05 \u00d7 f luxIUE ; the systematic uncertainty associated with this adjustment\nhas been propagated through all subsequent error calculations. Typically, the shifts improved\nthe appearance of the curves, although the offsets were not eliminated in all cases. Given the\ngeneral smoothness of the transition between UV and FUV portions of the extinction curve\nin most cases, it might seem reasonable to introduce further shifts to align these segments;\nnevertheless, because the observed offsets fall generally within the error bounds, because we\nare interested in the detailed shape of the curve at UV and FUV wavelengths, and since we\nhave no independent objective basis for such shifts, no further processing of the individual\ncurves has been performed. It should also be noted that any residual offsets appear to be\nbiased in the direction of decreased A(\u03bb)/A(V ); thus, abundance requirements derived from\nthe FUV data may be slight underestimates.\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nH2 in the Magellanic Clouds\n\nAs already mentioned, a notable difficulty in deriving extinction curves that extend into\nthe FUV is the existence of strong molecular hydrogen absorption bands longward of the\nLy\u03b1 line. Nevertheless, stellar observations of sufficient quality to allow the H2 absorption\nto be modelled and removed not only permit the construction of an extinction curve but\nalso provide more direct information on the intervening ISM. Recently, Tumlinson et al.\n(2002) completed a survey of molecular hydrogen in the LMC and SMC using several FUSE\nobservations of each Cloud; our sample introduces 15 new sight lines into the mix.\nIn considering these new molecular hydrogen measurements, however, it should be recognized that the current FUSE data generally have much lower signal-to-noise ratios than\nGalactic observations. In fact, they are also somewhat lower than the values for previouslyobserved Magellanic Cloud targets. Tumlinson et al. (2002) reported typical 4\u03c3 equivalent\nwidth limits of 30\u201340 m\u00c5, a level similar to values of 20\u201350 m\u00c5 for our comparison stars\nbut much lower than the 50\u2013120 m\u00c5 characteristic of the reddened targets. Because of these\ndata limitations, and because the goal of generating a reliable FUV continuum was given\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\na somewhat higher priority than making a rigorous assessment of molecular hydrogen, any\ncolumn densities smaller than about 1017 cm\u22122 , and a few that are somewhat larger, are\nsubject to sizable uncertainties. Nevertheless, we consider the models listed in Tables 3 and\n4 to be reasonable tallies of the H2 along each sight line.\nIn order to more fully understand how the new sight lines mesh with the Tumlinson et al.\n(2002) Magellanic Cloud H2 analysis, we have adopted the atomic hydrogen measurements\npreviously published by Fitzpatrick (1985a,b) for the individual sight lines (see Table 7);\nfor the pair listings in the table, we use the values derived directly from the extinction\ncurves by G03. It should be noted here that the process of determining atomic hydrogen\ncolumn densities for the Magellanic Clouds is complicated by the large quantities detected\nalong each sight line. The breadth of the Ly\u03b1 absorption profile produced by typical interstellar hydrogen distributions with line-of-sight lengths exceeding even a few kiloparsecs is\nsufficient to mask distinctions between separate velocity components; in particular, the profiles for atomic hydrogen gas in the LMC or SMC are often inextricably blended with their\nGalactic counterparts. Tumlinson et al. (2002) dealt with this problem by calibrating 21 cm\nemission measurements to Ly\u03b1 from the sight lines in their sample for which the Galactic\nand Magellanic Cloud 1215 \u00c5 profiles were not severely blended. Atomic hydrogen column\ndensities for the remaining paths in the data set were then estimated using this calibration\nand the observed 21 cm emission. G03 assessed Magellanic Cloud H I column densities by\nmeasuring the Ly\u03b1 profile in the reddened-to-comparison ratio spectrum for each extinction\npair, under the assumption that the Milky Way components would cancel each other. Each\nof these methods is subject to a significant level of uncertainty; if vertical error bars were\nto be plotted in Figure 4, among the Magellanic Cloud sight lines they might typically be\nabout 0.3 dex and occasionally larger than 1.0 dex. Nevertheless, differences between the\nFitzpatrick (1985a,b) H I values for the individual sight lines in each extinction pair generally\nare well matched by the corresponding column densities derived by G03.\nConsidered individually, our LMC and SMC sight lines and those studied by Tumlinson\net al. (2002) exhibit similar ranges in characteristics such as the molecular hydrogen fraction\nf (H2 ) (\u2261 2N(H2 )/[N(H I) + 2N(H2 )]) and the Magellanic Cloud portion of the color excess\nE \u2032 (B \u2212V );5 values for the two LMC sight lines studied by Gunderson, Clayton, & Green\n(1998) also match these samples. Since the current dataset was selected for its extinction\nproperties, we cannot speak to the overall frequency of molecular hydrogen detection in\nthe Clouds. However, as shown in Figure 4, the f (H2 )-values for paths along which we\ndetect a Cloud-based H2 component agree with the levels set by previously observed LMC\n5\n\nFollowing the procedure of Tumlinson et al. (2002), we adopt the definition E \u2032 (B \u2212V ) = E(B \u2212V ) \u2212 x,\nwhere x is 0.075 and 0.037 for LMC and SMC paths, respectively.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nand Galactic sight lines of large E(B \u2212V ). Notably, the sight lines toward AzV 456 and\nSk \u221267\u25e6 2 possess larger molecular hydrogen fractions than any examined by Tumlinson et\nal. (2002); meanwhile, among the paths directed toward our comparison stars we detect no\nMagellanic H2 components.\nBased on the previously-studied sight lines toward Sk -66\u25e619 and Sk -69\u25e6 270, it was\nfound that while the gas-to-dust ratio N(H I)/E \u2032(B \u2212V ) is much larger in the Clouds than\ntypically seen in the Milky Way, the quantity N(H2 )/E \u2032 (B \u2212V ) has a similar value in each\ngalaxy (Clayton et al. 1996; Gunderson et al. 1998). This suggests a close relationship\nbetween dust and H2 . Similar behavior is evident for our new sight lines, since although\nthe ratios N(H I)/E \u2032 (B \u2212V ) for these paths are roughly 4\u201310 times larger than the Galactic\nmean, comparing H2 column densities with the same color excesses leads to a range of values\naround the Galactic average. In this way our new sight lines complement the paths studied\nby Gunderson et al. (1998) and the more heavily reddened paths of Tumlinson et al. (2002),\nimplying generally lower values for f (H2 ) in the Clouds; nevertheless, the current dataset\nincludes sight lines with unique properties. Plotting the LMC N(H I)/E \u2032 (B \u2212V ) ratio as a\nfunction of E(B \u2212 V ) (see Figure 5), there is a clear distinction between Sk -67\u25e62 and other\nreddened sight lines: this one LMC path is characterized by an \"atomic\" ratio appropriate\nto Galactic curves, but because of its large molecular hydrogen column density the total\ngas-to-dust ratio approaches the values for other LMC sight lines. Coupled with its Milky\nWay-like N(H I) ratio, the agreement exhibited between the gas-to-dust ratios for Sk -67\u25e62,\nthe sight line with the largest f (H2 )-value in our sample, and sight lines dominated by atomic\ngas reinforces the concept that the mechanisms governing dust formation in the Galaxy\nand LMC are similar and that any differences in extinction arise out of how interstellar\nenvironmental conditions are manifested in dust grain population characteristics. The SMC\nsight line AzV 456 also possesses a \"Galactic\" value for N(H I)/E \u2032 (B \u2212V ) that gives a\nN(HTotal )/E \u2032 (B \u2212V ) ratio more closely resembling the values determined by Tumlinson et\nal. (2002) for other SMC paths.\nFurther details of the interstellar conditions, specifically the temperatures T01 and Tex ,\nin the Clouds can be derived from the relative rotational level populations of the individual\nsight lines (Table 4). When the cloud density is sufficiently high and H2 column densities\nare large enough for the gas to become substantially molecular, ortho-para conversion will\nlog(e)\n0\nbring T01 (\u2261 E1 \u2212E\n= ln(9N170K\n) close to the kinetic temperature.\nk\nlog(N (J=0)/g0 )\u2212log(N (1)/g1 )\n(0)/N (1))\nExcept for the AzV 462 sight line, its value is fairly uniform among the LMC and SMC\ncomponents of our H2 models and we derive a weighted mean temperature of 50\u00b13 K. The\nMagellanic Cloud component of H2 toward AzV 462 has the lowest column density among\nour extragalactic values, and the assumption that this value is consistent with the kinetic\ntemperature breaks down. The mean temperature we have derived for the Magellanic Cloud\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\ncomponents neglects AzV 462 and is somewhat lower than the overall Galactic mean of\n77\u00b117 K (Savage et al. 1977), but is consistent with both the value 55\u00b18 K derived from\nthe Galactic subsample for which N(H2 ) > 20.4 (Rachford et al. 2002) and temperatures\nderived by Tumlinson et al. (2002) for Magellanic Cloud gas along sight lines with some of\nthe largest molecular column densities. It should be noted that the errors ascribed to each\ntemperature listed in Tables 3 and 4 were derived from column density uncertainties, which\nwere often large. Thus, kinetic temperatures with uncertainties larger than about 60 K should\nbe regarded as less reliable. In particular, the formal uncertainty is listed in each case, even\nwhere it exceeds the calculated temperature, in order to indicate the relative reliability of\neach determination. We have also determined Tex for each sight line from the slope in a plot\nof N(J = 2, 3, 4, 5) versus the excitation potential.6 This excitation temperature reflects the\ninfluence of fluorescent UV pumping and H2 formation in excited states on the molecular\nhydrogen rotational level population (Jura 1975; Black & Dalgarno 1976). Like T01 , it is\nfairly uniform among the LMC and SMC sight lines and we calculate a weighted mean of\n244\u00b133 K, similar to previously-determined values for Magellanic Cloud sight lines (Shull et\nal. 2000). Comparing the column density ratios N(4)/N(2) and N(5)/N(3) for our sample\nwith Figure 11 from Tumlinson et al. (2002), we find that these sight lines are reasonably\ntypical of their high N(H2 ) paths; consequently, our measurements support their conclusions\nthat the H2 formation rate in the Clouds is low (10\u201340% of Galactic rates) and that at least\nsome regions are illuminated by relatively intense radiation fields (10\u2013100 times the Galactic\nmean). We note, however, that the proportion of outliers in our sample that do not fit the\nrange of Galactic models calculated by Tumlinson et al. (2002) is much smaller than theirs.\nValues of T01 and Tex were also derived for the Galactic components of our H2 models. A\nmean of T01 = 67\u00b14 K was derived for the sight lines with larger column densities and more\nrobust measurements, although higher, and likely to be in part non-thermal, temperatures\nare implied for several of the more diffuse paths. Excitation temperatures for the Galactic\ncomponents (239\u00b138 K) are similar to those we have determined for the Magellanic Clouds.\n\n3.2.\n\nFUV Extinction in the Magellanic Clouds\n\nBefore FUSE, only two reddened sight lines outside the Galaxy had been studied in the\nFUV (Clayton et al. 1996). Both regional extinction groups in the LMC are represented\n6\n\nMore generally, Tex is associated with values of TJ\u22122,J \u2261\n\n170K\u00d7(2J\u22121)\n2J+1 N (J\u22122)\nln[ 2J\u22123\n]\nN (J)\n\nodd J levels.\n\nEJ \u2212EJ\u22122\nlog(e)\nk\nlog[N (J\u22122)/gJ\u22122 ]\u2212log[N (J)/gJ ]\n\n=\n\n(for J \u2265 2), the temperature derived from comparing the populations of successive even or\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nby these two stars; specifically, Sk -66\u25e619 is associated with LMCAvg and Sk -69\u25e6 270 with\nLMC2 (Misselt et al. 1999). The UV extinction curves for these stars are typically nonCCM, but they share the trait of most Galactic curves in that their UV extinction slope\nblends smoothly into the FUV. These two sight lines have been included for comparison in\nTable 6, which defines the LMC2 and LMCAvg subsamples, although they were left out\nof the average extinction curves for those regions. Hutchings & Giasson (2001) published\nFUV extinction curves for 3 sight lines in each of the LMC and the SMC using FUSE data.\nUnfortunately, the values of \u2206(B-V) for the reddened/unreddened star pairs chosen for that\nstudy are too small (\u223c0.02-0.07 mag) for detailed extinction studies. More specifically,\nthese reddening values are comparable in size to the variation in the foreground E(B \u2212V )\nand similar to the magnitude of the photometric uncertainties (Schwering & Israel 1991;\nOestreicher, Gochermann, & Schmidt-Kaler 1995; Massey 2002). So, within the uncertainties\nthere is no significant reddening difference for any of the star pairs in Hutchings & Giasson\n(2001), and those sight lines are not included in this study.\nThe new LMC and SMC FUV extinction curves presented here seem to follow the trend\nof Sk -69\u25e6270 and Sk -66\u25e619. Despite any small remaining offsets between the IUE and FUSE\nextinction curves (see \u00a7 2.1), the new FUV curves closely follow an extrapolation of their\nFM fits from the UV. Out of our sample, only two curves exhibit significant deviations from\nthis overall trend, AzV 456 and Sk -69\u25e6 228. AzV 456 is our lone reddened star situated in\nthe SMC wing, and the FUSE portion of its extinction curve more closely resembles its FUV\nCCM curve than an extrapolation of its FM fit in the UV. Coincidentally, the disagreement\nwith the FM fit begins near the onset of molecular hydrogen absorption features; however,\nattempting to reconcile the two portions of the FUSE curve by adjusting the H2 column\ndensities indicates that a single component for the Clouds cannot reproduce the observed\ncontinuum level shift, nor does it appear that a simple combination of overlapping components would accomplish this result. The effect does not appear to be related to a difference in\nthe sensitivity of the various FUSE channels either, since the continuum across this spectral\nregion is contained in both the LiF1B and LiF2A detector bands. Similar kinks are apparent\nto a much smaller degree in the Galactic curves for HD 62542, HD 73882, and HD 210121\n(Paper I); nevertheless, those curves match the FM fits within the formal uncertainties [approximately 14% in A(\u03bb)/A(V) across the FUSE band] and we feel that it would not be\nappropriate to speculate further about the origin of these features until a larger data sample\nis compiled.\nThe FUV extinction curve for Sk -69\u25e6228 is very noisy, which would usually indicate a\npoor match with its unreddened comparison star, but this same star is a good match through\nthe UV. The problem seems to arise with a complex of photospheric Fe III lines evident\nin the comparison star spectrum, Sk -65\u25e6 15. An examination of intermediate continuum\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nsegments demonstrates that the reddened and comparison stellar spectra have very similar\nshapes aside from these lines, and that connecting the lower wavenumber portion of this\nstar's FUV extinction curve with the two highest wavenumber points would be a reasonable\napproximation. Notably, this procedure results in an FUV curve that is consistent with an\nextension of the UV FM fit, despite the impression that a small offset is still present after\nthe FUSE flux adjustment. The curve is still included in further analysis for the sake of\ncompleteness and because our comparison sample is limited, but we note that the mean\ncurve derived for the LMC2 group, which includes this path, is consistent with the other\ncurves in the group unaffected by any taint of mismatch. On the whole, the ease with which\nthe UV and FUV extinction curves line up for our Magellanic Cloud sight lines complements\nthe results for Milky Way sight lines; namely, that most Galactic sight lines also seem to\nshow FUV extinction that is a good extrapolation of the FM fits made to the extinction\ncurves in the UV. Agreement between the CCM relation and FUV extinction, however, has\nproved less ubiquitous. For instance, Buss et al. (1994) found that the FUV extinction for\ntwo Galactic sight lines with large (\u03c1 Oph) and small (HD 25443) values of RV follow CCM\nclosely, but that there are exceptions; one notable example is the bright-nebula sight line\ntoward HD 37903 which shows a steeper extinction in the FUV, based on Copernicus data,\nthan would be predicted by CCM. Paper I, which included paths such as HD 210121 and\nHD 62542 that do not follow CCM in the UV, came to similar conclusions. Although the\nUV extinction curves for each sight line they studied could be smoothly extrapolated into\nthe FUV using an FM fit, only three paths that followed CCM through UV wavelengths\nwere also in accord across the FUV. The CCM relations for four others from Paper I either\nover or underestimated their FUV extinction, as small discrepancies in the UV became more\npronounced at shorter wavelengths, and the two non-CCM curves diverged more strongly\nfrom their RV -based curves with increasing wavenumber. Because the LMC and SMC curves\ndo not have a CCM-like wavelength dependence and because the S/N ratios of the individual\nextinction curves are relatively low, subtle variations in the FUV slope such as those seen\nby Buss et al. (1994) cannot be ruled out.\n\n3.3.\n\nFUV MEM Modelling: Grain Properties\n\nTo increase the S/N for MEM modelling purposes, we have constructed average extinction curves for the LMC average and LMC2 regions outlined by Misselt et al. 1999 (see\nTable 6); the curves are plotted in Figure 6. The two sight lines in the SMC, which represent the bar and wing regions, are considered individually. Using the two average LMC\ncurves and the two SMC curves, we have extended the dust-grain population analysis of\nClayton et al. (2003) into the FUV. We employ a (slightly) modified version of the MEM\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nextinction-fitting algorithm (Kim et al. 1994; Kim & Martin 1996). Instead of using the\nnumber of grains of a given size to describe the dust population, the algorithm employs the\nmass distribution in which m(a)da is the mass of dust grains per H atom in the size interval\nfrom a to a+da. Thus, the traditional MRN-type model (Mathis, Rumpl, & Nordsieck 1977)\nbecomes m(a) \u221d a\u22120.5 . We use a power law with exponential decay (PED) as the template\nfunction for each component. The data are examined at 34 wavelengths, and the grain cross\nsections are computed over the range 0.0025\u20132.7 \u03bcm with 50 logarithmically spaced bins.\nThe shape of the mass distribution is strongly constrained only for data over the interval\n0.02\u20131 \u03bcm. Below 0.02 \u03bcm, the Rayleigh scattering behavior constrains only total mass;\nabove 1 \u03bcm, the \"grey\" nature of the dust opacity also forces the MEM algorithm to simply\nadjust the total mass, using the shape of the template function to specify the size dependence\nof the distribution. The total mass of dust is constrained using both the gas-to-dust ratio\nand \"cosmic\" abundances (i.e., we try not to use more carbon or silicon than is available).\nThe elemental abundance standards used in this analysis are those adopted in Paper I for\nthe Galaxy (358 and 35 atoms per million H for C and Si, respectively), and by Clayton\net al. (2003) for the LMC and SMC (110 and 65 for the LMC and 54 and 11 atoms per\nmillion H for the SMC); Table 7 reports the values of the gas-to-dust ratios used here for\nthe LMC and SMC. We consider only three-component models of homogeneous, spherical\ngrains: modified \"astronomical silicate\" (Weingartner & Draine 2001), amorphous carbon\n(Zubko et al. 1996), and graphite (Laor & Draine 1993). While it must be acknowledged\nthat the three grain component system we have used to model these extinction curves is\nsimpler than might be expected of actual interstellar dust, the results can be quite useful for\nidentifying grain population properties that distinguish sight lines from one another. The\nsame component-specific PED constraints (e.g., the onset of the exponential cutoff) adopted\nin Paper I were utilized for the current modelling.\nThe MEM fits to FM parameterizations of the average Magellanic Cloud extinction\ncurves listed in Table 6 are presented in Figures 7 and 8. The first plot shows the amount of\nextinction provided by the three distinct grain components, as well as the total extinction\nof the model, compared to the FM fit associated with each extinction curve. The error bars\nplotted on these fits are indicative of the mean gap between the FM fit and the underlying\nextinction curve in each wavelength bin. The fractions of the adopted elemental abundances\navailable for each grain component that are required by the best MEM fit are listed in\nTable 8. Figure 8 depicts the corresponding mass distributions for different sizes of grains\nbelonging to each model component relative to the mass of hydrogen.\nThe proportions of the available silicon and carbon used in the MEM fits to the various\nFM parameterizations cover a very wide range, as was seen in fits to IR through UV data\nalone by Clayton et al. (2003). Three general factors determine the fraction of silicon and\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\ncarbon that any individual sight line will use. First, the higher the gas-to-dust ratio is, the\nmore metals are available in the gas phase. Second, the higher the abundances of metals\nare, the more material is available. Finally, high values of RV imply a greater than average\nmass fraction in larger grains which are not as efficient per unit mass as smaller grains. For\ninstance, it can be seen from the MEM fits that the SMC wing (AzV 456), which has a\nlow gas-to-dust ratio and low elemental abundances relative to the Galaxy, uses more than\n100% of the available silicon. However, the LMC2 and the SMC bar (AzV 18) regions, which\nalso have both low elemental abundances but are characterized by higher gas-to-dust ratios,\nuse less than half the amount of available silicon that the LMCAvg and SMC wing regions\nrequire and also significantly less carbon.\nA recent observation has suggested that silicon is relatively undepleted in the SMC bar\n(Welty et al. 2001). However, model fits to the average SMC bar extinction indicate that its\ncurve cannot be fitted with carbon grains alone (Weingartner & Draine 2001; Clayton et al.\n2003). Figures 7 and 8 clearly show that this conclusion is born out in the current fits. SMC\nextinction for both bar and wing is very steep in the FUV, necessitating the presence of a\nlarge population of small grains. Yet because the 2175 \u00c5 bump is absent in the bar region,\nsmall (a < 0.02\u03bcm) carbon grains do not meet the SMC FUV extinction requirements; thus,\nsilicates play a very important role in the models. Even our SMC wing sight line, whose\nextinction curve follows CCM reasonably well, places a much higher demand on silicon\nreserves than carbon: a typical Galactic curve conforming to CCM allows graphite to fulfill\na significant part in FUV extinction due to the strength of its UV bump, but the SMC wing\nbump is somewhat weaker than the RV =2.19 CCM curve would imply. The next steepest\nsight lines, in the LMC, do not show much difference in demand from a typical Galactic\ncurve (HD 14250 was chosen from Paper I for illustration purposes), once the gas-to-dust\nratio differences are taken into account. Typically, carbon grains are responsible for most of\nthe visible extinction and silicon grains for most of the UV extinction; therefore, in general,\nboth species of grains are needed along any sight line to get a good fit to the extinction\ncurve. Apart from deficits of large silicate and carbon grains in the SMC, the MEM analysis\nof the Magellanic Cloud FUV extinction produces results similar to those derived from an\nanalysis of several Galactic sight lines (Paper I). The Galactic sight lines, like the SMC wing\nor LMCAvg, are more likely to use more than 100% of the available silicon and/or carbon.\nAmong these sight lines, the strength of the 2175 \u00c5 bump in relation to the FUV rise is\nthe factor that distinguishes whether the stiffer abundance demand is placed on silicon or\ncarbon. Likewise, the element most demanded by the SMC bar sight line and the mean\nLMC2 curve is determined by this factor, although the minimal presence of the bump in\nthese curves allows the modelling to make more efficient use (especially in small grains) of\nthe available elements.\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nThe general structure in the size vs m(a) curves for extinction out to 8 \u03bcm\u22121 for the\nMagellanic Cloud sight lines does not change much when the FUSE data are included.\nFigures 7 and 8 showing the MEM fits and size vs m(a) curves cannot be directly compared\nto Figure 3 of Clayton et al. (2003) because there are differences in the input parameters\nsuch as the gas-to-dust ratios. But the MEM models run with the same input parameters\nfor extinction curve that are cutoff at 8 \u03bcm\u22121 and those shown here, which extend to 10\n\u03bcm\u22121 , are quite similar; there is at most a few percent difference in the amount of silicon\nand carbon required by the two sets of models for the four SMC and LMC curves. The\nstructure evident in the mass distributions of Figure 8 particularly identify grain sizes for\nwhich each component in our simple model can account for the detailed shape of each\nextinction curve. For instance, the two peaks in the amorphous carbon distribution for HD\n14250 correspond roughly to maxima appearing in the silicate distribution of Kim et al.\n(1994) in their silicate-graphite model. These authors ascribe the peaks to the requirements\nof fitting the optical and UV portions of the extinction curve using the spectral wavelength\ndependence appropriate to each of the two grain components in their model. In the case\nof AzV 456 (the SMC wing), however, efforts to reproduce the extinction curve using this\nthree-component model appear to require dramatic peaks and dips in the mass distribution\nas a function of grain size. Aside from this curve, however, the scale of structure in the\ndistribution is consistent with levels noted by previous studies (Kim et al. 1994; Clayton\net al. 2003). For AzV 456, the solution requires that the graphite distribution be strongly\npeaked in order to account for the 2175 \u00c5 bump and provide as much extinction as possible\nat FUV wavelengths. Since the FUV portion of this curve extends, or even amplifies, the\nsteep rise at the short-wavelength end of the previous IR through UV result (Clayton et al.\n2003), there is no relaxation of the demand on silicon reserves. Specifically, when comparing\nMEM solutions for the SMC wing curve with and without the FUSE data, nearly identical\nproportions of the available silicon and carbon are utilized. The only notable distinction\nbetween the two solutions is that a few percent of the amorphous carbon demand is shifted\nto graphite when the FUV data are included. The extinction curves for our other groups\nalso smoothly extend from the UV into FUV wavelengths, and the models derived from IRto-UV and IR-to-FUV data require almost precisely the same amounts of silicon and carbon\nbe present in dust grains. The similarity in the MEM results for these two sets of models\nmay be due to the efficiency of the small grains in FUV extinction, in that large numbers\nof such grains are not needed, or perhaps the observed amounts of FUV extinction can be\nprovided by the larger grains which are also important for extinction at longer wavelengths.\nThis issue will be investigated further as we study the distinction between global and sightline-specific FUV extinction characteristics of using a much larger number of sight lines, in\na future paper.\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\n4.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis paper is the second in a series investigating the FUV characteristics of extinction\ndue to interstellar dust. The first paper dealt with a small sample of Galactic sight lines\nwith a variety of RV values, including paths whose extinction does not conform to the CCM\nparameterization. This paper examined a similarly-sized set of sight lines probing the Small\nand Large Magellanic Clouds, with the goal of determining how the addition of FUV data\nto their corresponding extinction curves affected models of Magellanic Cloud dust grain\nproperties.\nUsing FUSE observations of four stars in the SMC and 12 stars in the LMC, we were able\nto construct two extinction curves for the SMC and seven representing the LMC. Despite the\npoor quality of the data for some of the reddened stars, molecular hydrogen was measured for\neach sight line and their corresponding absorption features were removed from consideration\nin the extinction analysis. Flux mismatches between IUE and FUSE data, likely due to\npoor S/N values in the affected observations, were alleviated by rescaling the entire FUSE\nspectrum. Comparison of the resulting FUV extinction with the curve constructed only\nthrough wavelengths observed by IUE demonstrated that the FUV portions were generally\nconsistent with a smooth extrapolation of the IR-to-UV curve. Nevertheless, we note that\na \"kink\" appeared in the AzV 456 curve, similar to much smaller features present in curves\nanalysed in Paper I. We plan to address the existence and nature of this kink in a subsequent\npaper examining the variation in properties of FUV extinction.\nIt was anticipated that including FUV data in the MEM analysis of the Magellanic Cloud\ndust grain population might give rise to significantly different properties than Galactic dust\nsince the FUV rise in the Clouds is generally much steeper than it is in the Milky Way,\nand the UV bump is smaller. However, aside from some complex structure likely driven by\nthe simplicity of our grain component model, the sight lines through the Clouds exhibitting\nGalactic-like extinction are similar to Galactic paths in that they demand 100% or more\nof the available carbon and/or silicon. The only real differences between the populations\nfor these galaxies are that the SMC wing sight line has a much smaller grain size cutoff\nfor astronomical silicates and amorphous carbon and a generally smaller dust mass. MEM\nsolutions for the sight lines through the Clouds that exhibited more distinctly MagellanicCloud-type extinction were able to satisfy their curves using smaller proportions of the\nelements available to them; the SMC bar solution, like that for the SMC wing, is characterized\nby a smaller grain size cutoff and lower dust mass than Galactic or LMC solutions. The\naddition of the FUSE data to the analysis does not dramatically alter the properties of each\ndust population, except to shift small amounts of the carbon demand between amorphous\ncarbon and graphite.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nThe molecular hydrogen abundances determined in the process of constructing the full\nIR-to-FUV extinction curves supplement those already appearing in the literature. Although\nthe emphasis has been on eliminating H2 absorption features from the spectra rather than\nderiving robust column density measurements, our results are consistent with the larger\nrecent survey of molecular hydrogen in the Magellanic Clouds by Tumlinson et al. (2002)\nand we complement their paths by probing several sight lines with larger column densities.\nAmong these sight lines, E(B \u2212V )/N(H I) ratios are generally reduced relative to Galactic\nvalues while E(B \u2212V )/N(H2 ) are roughly the same, implying somewhat lower f (H2 )-values\nin the Clouds than are typical in the Milky Way for similar degrees of reddening.\nThis study was supported by NASA grant NAG5-108185.\n\nREFERENCES\nBlack, J.

The LMC value for log10 [N(H I)/E \u2032 (B \u2212V )] (dashed line; Koornneef\n1982) is also plotted in both graphs for reference.\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\n\n0\n\nA(\u03bb)/A(V)\n\n10\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n10\n\nSMC Bar\nLMC2\n\n5\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n10\n\nSMC Wing\nLMCAvg\n\n5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n-1\n1/\u03bb [\u03bcm ]\n\n8\n\n10\n\n0\n\nFig. 6.- Comparing the LMC, SMC, and Galactic Average Extinction Curves.\nAverage extinction curves for the Magellanic Cloud regions LMC2 and SMC bar, those more\ndistinct in character from Galactic extinction, are shown in the upper panel of the above\nplot; the lower panel depicts the mean curves for the LMCAvg and SMC wing groupings.\nBoth panels include the CCM RV =3.1 curve in the role of a Galactic reference. The LMC\nand SMC curves are offset 1 and 2 units in A(\u03bb)/A(V ), respectively, from the Galactic curve\nin each panel.\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\n\nFig. 7.- MEM Average Extinction Curve Fits.\nThe MEM fits of astrophysical silicate, amorphous carbon, and graphite dust components\nto FM parameterizations of the average extinction curves in Figure 6 are plotted above.\nIt should be noted that the MEM models were adjusted to reproduce the FM fit to each\nextinction curve; consequently, the SMC wing curve does not match the AzV 456/AzV 70\nextinction plot of Figure 2 in full detail. The error bars are indicative of the deviation\nbetween the FM fit and the extinction curve in nearby bins. For comparison, a typical\nGalactic sight line is represented in this plot by HD 14250 (RV =2.98\u00b10.14; Paper I).\n\n\f\u2013 29 \u2013\n\nFig. 8.- MEM Dust Grain Mass Distributions.\nThe MEM grain size vs m(a)da functions for each of the average extinction curves of Figure 6\nare plotted above. Of particular note, the SMC grain distributions do not include silicate\nor amorphous carbon grains as large as are required to fit extinction curves in the LMC or\nthe Galaxy. Also, the graphite grain distribution for the SMC wing is strongly peaked by\nthe constraints implied in the bump strength and FUV rise of its extinction curve. As in\nFigure 7, HD 14250 stands in for a typical Galactic sight line.\n\n\fTable 1.
