The induced\nmagnetic field of the neutron stars is found as follows. B\n\n( in )\n\n=\n\n\u03b7\nT7 \u2212 \u03b7\n\nB (0) ,\n\n\u03b7=\n\nm(3 P2 ) \u22123\nRNS ,6\n0.1mSun\n\n(T7 denotes the interior temperature of the neutron star in unit of 107 K). The induced magnetic field\nwill gradually increase with the temperature of the neutron star decreasing in their late evolutionary\nstage. A magnetar may appear in a condition when T7 \u00d8 \u03b7. The upper limit of the induced\nmagnetic field of 3P2 superfluid is 3.35\u00d71014\u03b7.\n\n1.\n\nA Question\n\nIt is generally believed that there is a very strong magnetic field, B > 1012 gauss, for most of the\nneutron stars (e.g. Shapiro and Teukolski, 1984). There probably are magnetars with ultra-strong\nmagnetic field strength over the quantum critical threshold, Hcr =4.414\u03bc1013 gauss (Duncan &\nThompson 1992; Paczynski;1992; Usov 1992; Thompson & Duncan, 1995,1996). Anomalous\nX-ray Pulsars (AXPs) and Soft Gamma Repeaters (SGRs) are classes of candidates to magnitars\n(e.g. Kouvelliotou et al. 1998, 1999; Hurley et al. 1999; Mereghetti&stella 1995; Wilson et al.\n1999).The magnetic field of the magnetars may be such strong as 1014-1015 gauss.\nWhat is the origin of the ultra-strong magnetic field for the magnetars? It is a very interesting\nquestion. Some models for origin of magnetars have been proposed. Ferrario & Wickrammasinghe\n(2005) suggest that the extra-strong magnetic field of the magnetars is descended from their stellar\nprogenitor with high magnetic field core. Iwazaki(2005) proposed the huge magnetic field of the\nmagnetars is some color ferromagnetism of quark matter. Recently Vink & Kuiper (2006) suggest\nthat the magnetars originate from rapid rotating proto-neutron stars.\nWe are to propose a new model of origin of magnetars in terms of the behavior of the anisotropic\n3\nPF2 neutron superfluid in this paper.\n\nII On anisotropic 3P2 neutron superfluid\nThere are two kinds of neutron superfluid interior of a neutron star in general: one is the\nisotropic 1S0 neutron superfluid with critical temperature of phase transition Tl o1.0\u03bc1010K.\n1\n\nThis research is supported by Chinese National Science Foundation No.10573011, No.10273006, and the\nDoctoral Program Foundation of State Education Commission of China\n\n1\n\n\fThe density range of the isotropic 1S0 superfluid neutron state is r ~ (1.0\u03bc1011-1.6\u03bc1014 )g/cm3..\nAnother superfluid is the anisotropic 3P2 neutron superfluid. Energy gap calculations show\nthat the pairing gap varies with the density of neutrons ( see Fig. 8 of Elgag\u00f8y et al. (1996)) as\nfollows. a) The 3PF2 neutron pair energy gap appears, D(3PF2(n)) > 0, in the region 1.3 \u00d71014 < \u03c1\n(g/cm3) < 7.2 \u00d71014, where D(3PF2(n)) is an increasing function of the density for the region \u03c1 <\n3.3\u00d71014 g/cm3 and it is a rapidly decreasing function of the density for the region \u03c1 > 5.2\u00d71014\ng/cm3. b) The maximum of the 3PF2 neutron pair energy gap is about 0.048 MeV at r @ 4.2\ng/cm3. c) D(3PF2(n)) is almost a constant about the maximum with error less than 3% in the\nrather wide range 3.3\u00d71014 < \u03c1 (g/cm3) < 5.2\u00d71014.\nThe anisotropic 3PF2 superfluid neutron state can exist in the rather wide density region 3.3\u00d71014\n< \u03c1 (g/cm3) < 5.2\u00d71014 when the temperature decreases down to the critical temperature, T\u03bb\n(3PF2(n)), which corresponds to the maximum of the 3PF2 neutron pair energy gap\n\nT \u2264 T\u03bb ( 3 PF2 ( n )) = \u0394 max ( 3 PF2 ( n )) / 2 k \u2248 2.78 \u00d7 108 K .\n\n(1)\n\nA 3P2 neutron Cooper pair has a spin angular momentum with a spin quantum number, s =1. The\n3P neutron Cooper pair possesses a magnetic moment being twice of the abnormal magnetic\n2\nmoment for a neutron, 2 mn on magnitude, and its projection on an external magnetic field\n(z-direction) is mpair= - sz\u00d7(2 mn) , sz =1,0,-1.\n\n\u03bc n = 0.966 \u00d7 10\u221223\n\nerg / gauss\n\n(2)\n\nBehavior of the 3P2 neutron superfluid is Similar to behavior of the liquid 3He in very low\ntemperature (Leggett, 1975):\n1) The projection distribution for the magnetic moment of the 3P2 neutron Cooper pairs in a\ncircumstance without external magnetic field is on equal probability, or Equal Spin Pair (ESP)\nphase similar to the A- phase of the liquid 3He in very low temperature (Leggett, 1975). The 3P2\nneutron superfluid is basically isotropic without significant magnetic moment in the case no\nexternal magnetic field. We name it as the A- phase of the 3P2 neutron superfluid.\n2) However, The projection distribution for the magnetic moment of the 3P2 neutron Cooper pairs\nin the circumstance with external magnetic field is not on equal probability. The number of the\n3P neutron Cooper pair with paramagnetic magnetic moment is more than one with diamagnetic\n2\nmagnetic moment. Therefore, the 3P2 neutron superfluid possesses a whole induced paramagnetic\nmagnetic moment and its behavior is anisotropic under external magnetic field. We name it as the\nB- phase of the 3P2 neutron superfluid similar to the B-phase of the liquid 3He in very low\ntemperature (Leggett, 1975).\n2\n\n\fIII. Induced paramagnetic magnetic moment of the 3P2 neutron\nsuperfluid in the B-phase\nThe induced paramagnetic magnetic moment of the 3P2 neutron superfluid in the B-phase may be\nsimply estimated as follows:\nThe system of the 3P2 neutron Cooper pairs with spin quantum, s = 1, may be taken as a\nBose-Einstein system. All 3P2 neutron Cooper pairs may condense into same state with lowest\nenergy (the fundamental state, E=0) in very low temperature. However, a paramagnetic magnetic\nmoment possesses lower energy than a diamagnetic magnetic moment under the external magnetic\nfield by stability. Therefore, the 3P2 neutron Cooper pair has energy sZ\u03bc2mnB(tot)\n\n(sZ =1,0,-1)\n\nunder the magnetic field due to its magnetic moment [-sZ\u03bc2mn], where B(tot) is the total magnetic\nfield including the initial background magnetic field (which originates from the collapsed core of\nprogenitor during supernova explosion) and the induced magnetic field, B(tot) = B(0)+B(in) . We\ndenote the number of 3P2 neutron Cooper pairs with spin projection sz =1,0,-1 by n1, n0 and n-1\nrespectively. Their relative ratios are\n( tot )\nn\u22121\n= e 2 \u03bcn B / kT ,\nn0\n\n( tot )\nn1\n= e \u22122 \u03bcn B / kT\nn0\n\nn\u22121 + n0 + n1 = nn (3 P2 )\n\n(3)\n\nThe difference of the 3P2 neutron Cooper pair number with paramagnetic and diamagnetic\nmagnetic moment is\n\n4 \u03bcn B (tot )\n\u0394n\u22131 = n\u22121 \u2212 n1 \u2248\nnn (3 P2 )\n9 kT\n\n(4)\n\n(in a condition \u03bc n B ( tot ) << kT )\nNeutrons combined into the 3P2 Cooper pairs are just in a thin layer with thickness\n\n2mn \u0394 n (3 P2 ) near the surface of the Fermi sphere in the momentum sphere.

Thus, the total number of neutrons into\n\nN n (3 P2 pair ) \u2248 qN A m(3 P2 ( n)) / 2\n\n(6)\n\n3\n\n\fTherefore, the total difference of the 3P2 neutron Cooper pair number with paramagnetic and\ndiamagnetic magnetic moment is\n\n\u0394N \u22131 =\n\n4 \u03bcn B ( tot )\n2 \u03bcn B (tot )\nN n (3 P2 pair ) =\nqN A m(3 P2 (n))\n9 kT\n9 kT\n\n(7)\n\nThe total induced magnetic moment, of the anisotropic neutron superfluid is thus\ntot ) 3\n( P2 ) = \u0394N \u22131 \u00d7 2\u03bcn =\n\u03bc (pair\n\n4 \u03bcn B (tot )\nqN A m(3 P2 (n)) \u03bcn\n9 kT\n\n(8)\n\nwhere m(3 P2 ( n)) is the mass of the anisotropic neutron superfluid in the neutron star, NA is\nthe A'vogadro constant. The factor (4 / 9) \u03bc n B ( tot ) / kT is introduced for taking the effect of\nthermal motion on the direction of the magnetization.\nAccording to the formulae of the magnetic moment with the polar magnetic field\n3\n\u03bc NS = Bp RNS\n/ 2 ( Shapiro and Teukolski, 1984, here Bp is the polar magnetic field strength and\nB\n\nRNS is the radius of the neutron star), the induced magnetic field by the total magnetic moment of\nthe anisotropic neutron superfluid is then\n\nB (in ) =\n\n\u03b7 = 1.0[\n\n\u03b7\nT7 \u2212 \u03b7\n\nB (0)\n\n(9)\n\nm( 3 P2 (n)) \u22123\n]RNS ,6\n0.1msun\n\n(10)\n\nHere RNS,6 is the radius of the neutron star in unit of 10 km. T7 is temperature in the unit of 107K.\nThe induced magnetic field of the anisotropic superfluid will increases with the interior\ntemperature decreasing. The induced magnetic field will exceed the initial background magnetic\nfield when the temperature decreases down to T < 2\u03b7 \u00d7 10 K .\n7\n\nFor an example, for the case \u03b7=3, the induced magnetic field corresponding to the interior\ntemperature is tabulated in the Table .\nT7\n(in)\n\n(0)\n\nB /B\n\nIV.\n\n4.0\n\n3.5\n\n3.3\n\n3.2\n\n3.1\n\n3.0\n\n6.0\n\n10.0\n\n15.0\n\n30.0\n\nAn Upper limit of the magnetic field of the neutron stars\n\nThe Formulae (4) and (7)-(9) are valid only in the condition mnB(tot) << kT.

The corresponding formulae should be derived from eq. (3) when\n4\n\n\fthe temperature decreases further.\nThere is an upper limit of the induced magnetic field of 3P2 superfluid. The upper limit will be\narrived when all magnetic moments of 3P2 neutron Cooper pairs are arranged with paramagnetic\ndirection as the temperature decreases down to the absolute zero of Kelvin.

Conclusion and Discussion\nThe conclusion of this paper is that the ultra magnetic field of the magnetars originates really by\nthe induced magnetic field due to the induced paramagnetic moment of 3P2 superfluid with\nsignificant mass more than (0.3-0.6)m\u2299 in the temperature lower than 3.1\u00d7107K.\nIt should be pointed out that the neutron fluid is still in the normal Fermi fluid state in the region\n1.6\u00d71014 < \u03c1( g/cm3) < 3.3\u00d71014 and \u03c1 > 5.2\u00d71014 g/cm3 when the temperature is near the\nmaximum transition temperature T\u03bb(3P2(n)). However, the anisotropic (3P2(n)) superfluid region\nwill gradually enlarge when the temperature steadily decreases further, because the neutron\n(normal) Fermi fluid in some region will be transformed to the anisotropic (3P2) neutron\nsuperfluid when its temperature further decreases below the corresponding transition temperature,\nT \u2264 D(3P2(n)/2k.. Thus both the mass of the anisotropic (3P2) neutron superfluid and the\nparameter, h , will increase with temperature decreasing.\nFor all neutron stars with a significant 3P2 superfluid, their magnetic field will increase gradually\nas the star is cooling continually and all of them will evolution towards magnetars.\nIt is possible, many observed pulsars with magnetic field stronger more than 1012 gauss may be\nreally with the strong induced magnetic field of the significant 3P2 superfluid.\n\nReferences\nDuncan, R.C. & Thompson, C. 1992, ApJ, 392, L9\nElgag\u00f8y, \u00d8., Engvik, L., Hjorth-Jensen, M. and Osnes, E., 1996, PRL, 77, 1428-1431;\nArXiV: nucl-th/9604032\nFerrario L. & Wickrammasinghe D.,2005, MNRAS 367, 1323\nHurley, K. et al. 1999, ApJ, 510, L111\nIwazaki, A., 2005, Phys.
