This calculation and the isoperimetric\ninequality allow us to indirectly find the sets which minimize the function\ncalculating the boundary.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction and Results\n\nFor a metric space (X, d) with a notion of volume and boundary, an isoperimetric\ninequality gives a lower bound on the boundary of a set of fixed volume. Ideally,\nfor any fixed volume, it produces a set of that volume with minimal boundary.\nThe most well-known isoperimetric inequality states that, in Euclidean space,\nthe unique set of fixed volume with minimal boundary is the Euclidean ball.\nMore recently, questions of isoperimetric inequalities have arisen within various kinds of discrete spaces [12], [7], [9], [11], [10], [16], [20]. Not only are\nquestions regarding isoperimetric inequalities natural geometric questions, but\nthey are known to have many implications in areas such as measure concentration [18], [15], [19], [17] and the theory of random graphs [3], [6], [5], [4].\nOne of the more broadly known discrete isoperimetric inequalities is Harper's\nTheorem. Harper's Theorem involves the discrete space {0, 1}n and the `1\n\u2217 The first author was supported for eight weeks during the summer of 2010 through the\nUniversity of Nebraska-Lincolns Mentoring through Critical Transition Points grant (DMS0838463) from the National Science Foundation.\n\n1\n\n\fmetric; that is, the metric defined by the norm\n||(x1 , x2 , . . . , xn )||1 =\n\nn\nX\n\n|xi |\n\ni=1\n\nA graph G = (V, E) is defined on the vertex set V = {0, 1}n where the edge set\nE consists of points whose distance in the `1 metric is precisely 1:\nE = {(u, v) : u \u2208 {0, 1}n , v \u2208 {0, 1}n , ||u \u2212 v||1 = 1}\nHere, the vertex boundary of a set A \u2282 {0, 1}n consists of all points whose\ndistance from A in the graph metric is no more than 1:\n\u2202A = {v \u2208 V : d(v, A) \u2264 1}.\nAs usual, the distance between a point x and a set A is defined\nd(x, A) = inf d(x, a) = inf {the length of the shortest path from x to a}\na\u2208A\n\na\u2208A\n\nIn other words, the vertex boundary consists of both A and all of the neighbors\nof A. In [12] Harper shows that one can define an ordering on the 0-1 cube\n{0, 1}n such that a set of smallest vertex boundary is achieved on an initial\nsegment. Thus, the sets achieving the minimal boundary are nested.\nIn [7], Bollob\u00e1s and Leader found an isoperimetric inequality for a graph\nwhich is also defined using the `1 metric. The vertices of this graph are the\nvertices of the discrete torus Znm , where Zm denotes the integers modulo m\nand m is necessarily an even integer. The edges of this graph are points whose\ndistance using the `1 metric is precisely 1. In [7], Bollob\u00e1s and Leader use\na tool called a fractional system to show that the sets of minimal boundary\nof size |{x \u2208 Znm : ||x \u2212 ~0||1 \u2264 r}| (r = 0, 1, 2, . . . ) are precisely those balls:\n{x \u2208 Znm : ||x \u2212 ~0||1 \u2264 r}. Thus, the sets of minimal vertex boundary of size\n|{x \u2208 Znm : ||x \u2212 ~0||1 \u2264 r}| (r = 0, 1, 2, . . . ) again are nested.\nThe fact that sets achieving optimality are nested is crucial in both [12] and\n[7], as they use the technique of compression. Compression has been utilized\nin these and many other discrete isoperimetric problems to inductively find\nsets of minimal boundary, and relies heavily on the fact that the graph and its\nlower dimensional counterparts have sets of minimal boundary that are nested.\nDiscussions of compression as a technique in discrete isoperimetric problems can\nbe found in [8], [13], [1], and [2].\nIn the following we consider the vertex isoperimetric inequalities of a family\nof graphs which was previously unstudied. Specifically, we consider the family\nof graphs whose vertex set is Zk where two vertices are connected by an edge\nwhen their `\u221e -distance is 1. For each n \u2208 N, we produce a set in Zk of size n\nwhose vertex boundary is minimized. We do this by defining a well-ordering \u227a\non Zk and showing that a set of minimal boundary is an initial segment:\nTheorem 1. Let I be an initial segment in Zk , and A a finite, nonempty subset.\nIf |I| = |A| then |\u2202I| \u2264 |\u2202A|.\n2\n\n\fThus, there exist sets of minimal boundary which are nested. (The sets of\nminimal boundary are not unique, as we point out at the end of Section 2).\nTo prove Theorem 1, we use a version of compression which is similar to that\nused to prove Harper's Theorem in [14]. Compression alone is not enough to\nproduce a set of minimal boundary; instead we show that compressing a set and\na particular type of \"jostling\" eventually results in a set of minimal boundary.\nWe prove Theorem 1 in Section 2.\nIn Section 3, we show how one can use a \"1-dimensional compression\" technique to take a set A \u2282 Zk and produce a set of the same size whose boundary\nis no larger. We call such a set centralized. Then we are able to compute the\nboundary of centralized sets. This computation along with the isoperimetric inequality of Theorem 1 allows us to deduce which sets achieve the minimum value\nof the function which computes the boundary of centralized sets. This boundary computation technique may be useful in finding isoperimetric inequalities\nfor other related graphs.\nIn Section 4 we make some final comments on using the ideas in Section 3\nfor other graphs.\n\n2\n\nThe Proof of Theorem 1\n\nWe first consider the graph with vertex set Zk . Two vertices x, y \u2208 Zk are joined\nby an edge precisely when kx \u2212 yk\u221e = 1. That is, when\nmax\n\ni=1,2,...,k\n\n|xi \u2212 yi | = 1\n\nwhere x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xk ) and y = (y1 , y2 , . . . , yk ).\nWe define a well-ordering \u227a on Zk inductively. For Z1 , the well-ordering \u227a\nis:\n0 \u227a 1 \u227a \u22121 \u227a 2 \u227a \u22122 \u227a 3 * * *\nFor k > 1, the well-ordering \u227a on Zk is as follows: for u = (u1 , u2 , . . . , uk ) \u2208\nZk define\nM (u) = max{ui : i = 1, 2, . . . , k}\n\u227a\n\nwhere the maximum is according to the previously defined well-ordering on Z.\nThen for u, v \u2208 Zk with u 6= v, if M (u) \u227a M (v), then u \u227a v. If M (u) = M (v),\ndefine\niu = min{i : ui = M (u) where u = (u1 , u2 , . . . uk )}\niv = min{i : vi = M (v) where v = (v1 , v2 , . . . vk )}\nIf iv < iu then u \u227a v. Finally, if M (u) = M (v) and iu = iv , we define\nu0 = (u1 , u2 , . . . , uiu \u22121 , uiu +1 , . . . uk ) \u2208 Zk\u22121\nv 0 = (v1 , v2 , . . . , viu \u22121 , viu +1 , . . . vk ) \u2208 Zk\u22121\n\n3\n\n\fand state that u \u227a v precisely when u0 \u227a v 0 .\nFor example, for n = 3, here are the first forty elements according to this\nwell-ordering:\n1.(0, 0, 0)\n6.(1, 0, 1)\n11.(1, 0, \u22121)\n16.(1, \u22121, 1)\n21.(\u22121, 1, 0)\n26.(\u22121, \u22121, 1)\n31.(1, 1, 2)\n36.(\u22121, \u22121, 2)\n\n2.(0, 0, 1)\n3.(0, 1, 0)\n4.(0, 1, 1)\n7.(1, 1, 0)\n8.(1, 1, 1)\n9.(0, 0, \u22121)\n12.(1, 1, \u22121)\n13.(0, \u22121, 0)\n14.(0, \u22121, 1)\n17.(0, \u22121, \u22121)\n18.(1, \u22121, \u22121) 19.(\u22121, 0, 0)\n22.(\u22121, 1, 1)\n23.(\u22121, 0, \u22121) 24.(\u22121, 1, \u22121)\n27.(\u22121, \u22121, \u22121) 28.(0, 0, 2)\n29.(0, 1, 2)\n32.(0, \u22121, 2)\n33.(1, \u22121, 2)\n34.(\u22121, 0, 2)\n37.(0, 2, 0)\n38.(0, 2, 1)\n39.(1, 2, 0)\n\n5.(1, 0, 0)\n10.(0, 1, \u22121)\n15.(1, \u22121, 0)\n20.(\u22121, 0, 1)\n25.(\u22121, \u22121, 0)\n30.(1, 0, 2)\n35.(\u22121, 1, 2)\n40.(1, 2, 1)\n\nWe use the notation u \u0016 v to mean that either u = v or u \u227a v. For a \u2208 Z, we\nlet as denote its immediate successor in the well-ordering \u227a. Thus, for example,\n1s = \u22121\n\u22121s = 2\n0s = 1\nSince it will be used later, we present the following remark on how to calculate immediate successors using this well-ordering \u227a on Zk :\nRemark 1 (Calculating Successors).\nConsider x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xk ) \u2208 Zk . Let m be the smallest entry of x according to the well ordering \u227a of Z. Thus,\nm = xi for some i\nand\nm \u0016 xi for each i\nDefine\nim = max{i : xi = m}.\nIf im = k, then x1 = x2 = . . . = xk and the immediate successor of x is\n(0, 0, . . . , 0, xsk ).\nOtherwise, im < k. In this case, the immediate successor to x is the vector\nxs = (y1 , y2 , . . . , yk ) where xs has the same entries as x except that all entries\nxj which are equal to xim with j < im change to 0 (or stay 0 if xim = 0), xim\nchanges to xsim , and all entries xj which are equal to xsim with j > im change to\n0. That is,\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nif i < im and xi = xim or if i > im and xi = xsim\n\uf8f20\nyi = xsim if i = im\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nxi\notherwise\n\n4\n\n\fFor a set A \u2282 Zk , we use the notation \u2202A to denote\n\u2202A = {x \u2208 Zk : kx \u2212 ak\u221e \u2264 1 for some a \u2208 A}.\nThus, A \u2282 \u2202A. We note that this is the notation used in [14], [9], [10], and\nothers. We use |A| to denote the size of a finite set.\nOur goal will be to prove that, for any A \u2282 Zk |\u2202A| \u2265 |\u2202I|A| | where I|A|\nis the initial segment in Zk of length |A|, according to the well-ordering \u227a. In\norder to prove this, we will need some Lemmas about initial segments in Zk and\ntheir boundaries.\nFor a number a \u2208 Z, we let a+ denote the element of {a, a + 1, a \u2212 1} which\nis largest in the well-ordering \u227a and a\u2212 the element of {a, a + 1, a \u2212 1} which is\nthe smallest. Thus, for example,\n1\u2212 = 0\n\n1+ = 2\n\u22121+ = \u22122\n\n\u22121\u2212 = 0\n\n0+ = \u22121\n\n0\u2212 = 0\n\nLemma 1. If I \u2282 Zk is an initial segment, so is \u2202I\nProof. By induction on |I|. If |I| = 1, then I = {(0, 0, . . . , 0)} and \u2202I =\n{0, 1, \u22121}k which is the initial segment of size 3k . Now let v \u2208 Zk , and suppose\nthat I = {x \u2208 Zk : x \u0016 v} and \u2202I are initial segments. Let u be the successor\nof v. Note that u is not the zero vector. We will show that \u2202 (I \u222a {u}) is an\ninitial segment.\nLet v = (v1 , v2 , . . . , vk ). Note that the vector in Zk which is an element of \u2202I\nand the latest in the well-ordering \u227a is (v1+ , v2+ , . . . , vk+ ). Thus, by our inductive\nassumption,\n\u2202I = {x \u2208 Zk : x \u0016 (v1+ , v2+ , . . . , vk+ )}.\nNote that\n\u2202(I \u222a {u}) = \u2202I \u222a {(u1 + \u03b41 , u2 + \u03b42 , . . . , uk + \u03b4k ) : (\u03b41 , \u03b42 , . . . , \u03b4k ) \u2208 {0, 1, \u22121}k }.\nLet i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , k} and suppose that ui 6= 0. Then\n(u1 , u2 , . . . , ui\u22121 , u\u2212\ni , ui+1 , . . . , un ) \u227a (u1 , u2 , . . . , un )\nand for (\u03b41 , \u03b42 , . . . , \u03b4k\u22121 ) \u2208 {0, 1, \u22121}k\u22121 each of\n(u1 + \u03b41 , u2 + \u03b42 , . . . , ui\u22121 + \u03b4i\u22121 , u\u2212\ni , ui+1 + \u03b4i , . . . , uk + \u03b4k\u22121 )\n(u1 + \u03b41 , u2 + \u03b42 , . . . , ui\u22121 + \u03b4i\u22121 , ui , ui+1 + \u03b4i , . . . , uk + \u03b4k\u22121 )\nare adjacent to (u1 , u2 , . . . , ui\u22121 , u\u2212\ni , ui+1 , . . . , un ).\nThus, the elements (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) of \u2202(I \u222a {u}) which are not in \u2202I are\nprecisely those of the form:\n(\nu+\nif ui 6= 0\ni\nxi =\n0, 1, or \u2212 1 if ui = 0\n5\n\n\fNote that if ui 6= 0 then u+\ni is at least as large as 2 in the well-ordering \u227a on Z.\nFinally, recall that u is the immediate successor to v = (v1 , v2 , . . . , vk ) and that\nevery entry of (v1+ , v2+ , . . . , vk+ ) is at least as large as \u22121 in the well-ordering on\nZ. Thus, by Remark 1, we can see that the elements of \u2202(I \u222a {u}) which are not\nin \u2202I are the 3` immediate successors of (v1+ , v2+ , . . . , vk+ ) where ` is the number\nof 0 entries of u.\nWe note that we have also proved the following:\nLemma 2. Suppose I is an initial segment in Zk and let v be the first element\nnot in I. Then\n|\u2202(I \u222a {v})| = |\u2202I| + 3`\nwhere ` is the number of coordinates equal to 0 in v.\nThe following technical Lemma will be used in the proof of Theorem 1\nLemma 3. Suppose k \u2265 2 and consider a segment in Zk :\nS = {v \u2208 Zk : v0 \u2264 v \u2264 v1 },\n\nk \u2265 2.\n\nLet v0 = (v0,1 , v0,2 , . . . , v0,k ) and suppose that v0,j = 0 for all j 6= j \u2217 and\nv0,j \u2217 6= 0. Suppose that the last t vectors in S all do not have a 0 entry. Then\nfor any j \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , k}, j 6= j \u2217 and for any\n\u001a\n\u0018 \u0019\u001b\nt\ns \u2208 1, \u22121, 2, \u22122, . . . (\u22121)t+1\n2\nthere is a vector in S whose jth entry is s.\n\b\n\u0006 \u0007\nProof. Note that the numbers in the set 1, \u22121, 2, \u22122, . . . (\u22121)t+1 2t\nare the\nfirst t elements in the list 1, \u22121, 2, \u22122, 3, \u22123, . . . .\nRecall from Remark 1 how immediate successors in Zk are calculated. The\nonly way that t successive vectors all do not have a 0 entry is if a single coordinate\nis increasing (according to \u227a) in those successive vectors.\nSuppose it is the ith coordinate which is increasing in the final t vectors of S.\nThis implies that, in each of the t successive vectors that have no 0 coordinate,\nthe ith coordinate is smaller than any of the other coordinates (in the \u227a ordering\non Z). Thus, for any ` 6= i, the `th coordinate must be at least as large as the\ntth element in the list 1, \u22121, 2, \u22122, . . . . Hence we can see that every coordinate\nof v1 has a value at least as large as the tth element in the list 1, \u22121, 2, \u22122, 3, . . . .\nConsider any j 6= j \u2217 . By assumption, the jth coordinate v0 is 0. Recall\nthat every coordinate of v1 has a value at least as large as the tth element in\nthe list 1, \u22121, 2, \u22122, 3, . . . and S is the segment between v0 and v1 . Thus, by\nthe definition of the ordering \u227a on Zk , for the 1st through tth elements in the\nlist 1, \u22121, 2, \u22122, . . . , there must be an element between v0 and v1 whose jth\ncoordinate is equal to that element.\n\n6\n\n\fSpecifically, let v0 = (v0,1 , v0,2 , . . . , v0,k ) and s \u2208 {1, \u22121, 2, . . . , (\u22121)t+1\nThen the vector x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xk ) where\n(\nv0,` if ` 6= j\nx` =\ns\nif ` = j\n\n\u0006t\u0007\n2\n\n}.\n\nhas an entry equal to s and v0 \u227a x \u0016 v1 . Thus, we have proven the Lemma.\nThe notation we use (and the technique used) in proving Theorem 1 is\nsimilar to that in that in the proof of Harper's Theorem in [14]. For A \u2282 Zk ,\ni \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , k}, and j \u2208 Z we define Aij to be the set of vectors in Zk\u22121 such\nthat, when a j is inserted in between the i \u2212 1th and ith entries, the resulting\nvector is in A. That is,\nAij = {x \u2208 Zk\u22121 : (x1 , x2 , . . . , xi\u22121 , j, xi , xi+1 , . . . , xk\u22121 ) \u2208 A}\nNow we are ready to prove Theorem 1.\nProof of Theorem 1. Let A \u2282 Zk be finite and nonempty. We proceed by induction on k. For k = 1, one can easily see that\n|\u2202A| = |A| + 2\nif A is a segment: A = {j \u2208 Z : a \u2264 j \u2264 b for some a, b \u2208 Z} and\n|\u2202A| > |A| + 2\nif A is not a segment. Since every initial segment in Z according to the wellordering \u227a is a segment, the Theorem is proved for k = 1.\nNow suppose A \u2282 Zk is finite and nonempty, k > 1, and the theorem is\nproven for all smaller positive k. Let i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , k}. Note that there are only\nfinitely many j \u2208 Z for which the set\nAij\nis nonempty, and that\nX\n\n|Aij | = |A|\n\nj\u2208Z\n\nWe define a set Ci which is the \"i-compression\" of A by specifying its k \u2212 1dimensional sections fixing the ith coordinate. Specifically, for j \u2208 Z, we define\n(Ci )ij to be the initial segment in Zk\u22121 of size |Aij |. This gives |(Ci )ij | = |Aij |\nfor each j. Thus, since\nX\n|Aij | = |A|\nj\u2208Z\n\nand\nX\n\n|(Ci )ij | = |Ci |\n\nj\u2208Z\n\n7\n\n\fwe have |Ci | = |A|. Now note that\n(\u2202A)ij = \u2202(Aij ) \u222a \u2202(Aij\u22121 ) \u222a \u2202(Aij+1 )\n(\u2202Ci )ij = \u2202((Ci )ij ) \u222a \u2202((Ci )ij\u22121 ) \u222a \u2202((Ci )ij+1 )\nBy definition, we know that |(Ci )ij | = |Aij |, |(Ci )ij\u22121 | = |Aij\u22121 |, and |(Ci )ij+1 | =\n|Aij+1 |. Also, (Ci )ij is an initial segment, so by induction we have |\u2202((Ci )ij )| \u2264\n|\u2202(Aij )|. Similarly for j + 1 and j \u2212 1.\nIf the union above were necessarily disjoint, we would be done. Since it's\nnot, we note the following: all of \u2202((Ci )ij ), \u2202((Ci )ij\u22121 ) and \u2202((Ci )ij+1 ) are\ninitial segments. Thus, they are ordered by containment. Thus, either the inequality |\u2202((Ci )ij )| \u2264 |\u2202(Aij )| or one of the equalities |\u2202((Ci )ij\u22121 )| \u2264 |\u2202(Aij\u22121 )|,\n|\u2202((Ci )ij+1 )| \u2264 |\u2202(Aij+1 )| is enough to give us that |(\u2202Ci )ij | \u2264 |(\u2202A)ij |.\nNote that j \u2208 Z was arbitrary. Thus, since\nX\n|(\u2202A)ij | = |\u2202A|\nj\u2208Z\n\nX\n\n|(\u2202Ci )ij | = |\u2202Ci |\n\nj\u2208Z\n\nwe have |\u2202Ci | \u2264 |\u2202A|.\nHence, we have shown that, for i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , k}, the ith-compression of A\nis a set of the same size with no larger boundary. We note that a set which is\ncompressed in every coordinate need not be an initial segment. For example,\nfor k = 3, the set\n{(0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 0), (1, 0, 0)}\nis i-compressed, but not an initial segment.\nLet X \u2282 Zk be a set of size |A| which has the following properties:\n1. |\u2202X| \u2264 |\u2202A|\n2. X is compressed in every coordinate i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , k}.\n3. If Z is any other set of size |A| satisfying the above properties 1 and 2,\nlet `(X) and `(Z) be the last elements of X and Z in the well-ordering \u227a\nrespectively. Then we must have\n`(X) \u0016 `(Z)\nIn words: X is a set of size |A| with boundary no larger than the boundary\nof A which is compressed in every coordinate (the previous arguments show\nthat such an X exists). We also choose X such that it is \"as close as possible\nto an initial segment\" as described in property 3: its last element is as small as\npossible. We will show that X must be an initial segment by contradiction.\nSuppose that X is not an initial segment. Then there exists x 6\u2208 X, y \u2208 X,\nsuch that x \u227a y. We note that, if xi = yi for some i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , k}, then\n\n8\n\n\fdefining\nx\u2217 = (x1 , . . . , xi\u22121 , xi+1 , . . . , xk )\ny \u2217 = (y1 , . . . , yi\u22121 , yi+1 , . . . , yk )\nwe have x\u2217 \u227a y \u2217 in Zk\u22121 , contradicting the fact that X is i-compressed. Thus,\neach of the coordinates of x and y must be different.\nLet S\u03b1 be the first segment in X. That is, S\u03b1 \u2282 X, S\u03b1 is a segment according\nto the ordering \u227a, and the immediate successor to the last element in S\u03b1 is not\nin X. Note that, since X is compressed in every coordinate, this implies that\n(0, 0, . . . , 0) \u2208 S\u03b1 . Let y be the first element in X\\S\u03b1 , and let x be its immediate\npredecessor. From the above comments, we know that either\nx = (0, 1, 1, . . . , 1) y = (1, 0, 0, . . . , 0)\nor x1 6= 0 and\nx = (x1 , x1 , . . . , x1 , xs1 , xs1 , . . . , xs1 )\n{z\n} |\n|\n{z\n}\n`\n\nn\u2212`\n\ny = (0, 0, . . . , 0, xs1 , 0, 0, . . . , 0)\n| {z }\n| {z }\n`\u22121\n\nk\u2212`\n\nCase 1:\nx = (0, 1, 1, . . . , 1) y = (1, 0, 0, . . . , 0)\nLet S\u03a9 be the last segment in X. That is, S\u03a9 = {w \u2208 Zk : u \u0016 w \u0016 v},\nS\u03a9 \u2282 X, v is the last element in X, and the immediate predecessor to u is not\nin X. Since x 6\u2208 X and u \u2208 X, by the above arguments we must have u1 6= 0\nand\nu = (u1 , 0, 0, . . . , 0)\n| {z }\nk\u22121\n\nfor some u1 6= 0. Additionally, we note that the successor to u is (u1 , 0, . . . , 0, 1)\nwhich must have a coordinate in common with x. Thus, by the above arguments,\nwe must have u = v. We note that by Lemma 2, there are at least 3k\u22121 elements\nwhich adjacent to u and are not adjacent to any other element in X. There are\n3 elements which are adjacent to x and not adjacent to any element of S\u03b1 \u2282 X.\nThus, we can see that\n\u2202((X \u222a {x})\\{u}) \u2264 \u2202(X) \u2212 3k\u22121 + 3 \u2264 \u2202(X),\n\n|(X \u222a {x})\\{u}| = |X|\n\nand the set (X \u222a{x})\\{u} is closer to an initial segment with respect to property\n3 above. Thus, we have reached a contradiction in Case 1.\nCase 2: x1 6= 0 and\nx = (x1 , x1 , . . . , x1 , xs1 , xs1 , . . . , xs1 )\n|\n{z\n} |\n{z\n}\n`\n\nk\u2212`\n\ny = (0, 0, . . . , 0, xs1 , 0, 0, . . . , 0)\n| {z }\n| {z }\n`\u22121\n\nk\u2212`\n\nLet S\u03a9 be the last segment in X. That is, S\u03a9 = {w \u2208 Zk : u \u0016 w \u0016 v}, S\u03a9 \u2282 X,\nv is the last element in X, and the immediate predecessor to u is not in X.\n9\n\n\fLet S\u03b2 be the first segment not in X. That is, S\u03b2 = {z \u2208 Zk : q \u0016 z \u0016 x}\nand the immediate predecessor of q is the last element of S\u03b1 . Note that, by the\nabove arguments, since q 6\u2208 X and y \u2208 X all of the entries of q and y must be\ndifferent. Thus, the vector q is somewhere in between\n\uf8f1\ns\ns\ns\ns\n\uf8f4\n1 , . . . , x1 , 1, x1 , x1 , . . . , x1 ) and x = (x1 , . . . , x1 , x1 , . . . , x1 ) if 1 < ` < k\n\uf8f4(x\n| {z } | {z }\n\uf8f4\n| {z }\n\uf8f2 | {z }\n`\u22122\n\n`\n\nk\u2212`\n\nk\u2212`\n\n\uf8f4\n(x1 , xs1 , . . . , xs1 , 1) and x = (x1 , xs1 , xs1 , . . . , xs1 )\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n(x1 , . . . , x1 , 1) and x = (x1 , x1 , . . . , x1 )\n\nif ` = 1\nif ` = k\n\nIf q has no 0 entries, then we know that there is no more than 30 = 1 element\nin Zk adjacent to q which is not adjacent to any other element of S\u03b1 \u2282 X. Also\nthere are 3t \u2265 1 elements in Zk larger than v which are adjacent to v and not\nadjacent to any other element in X, where t is equal to the number of 0 entries\nof v. Thus, we have\n\u2202((X \u222a {q}})\\{v}) \u2264 \u2202(X) \u2212 3t + 1 \u2264 \u2202(X),\n\n|(X \u222a {q}})\\{v}| = |X|\n\nand (X \u222a {q}})\\{v} is closer to an initial segment with respect to property 3\nabove.\nIt is possible for q to have a 0 entry. Specifically, we could have\nq = (x1 , . . . , x1 , 0, xs1 , . . . , xs1 )\n| {z } | {z }\n`\u22121\n\nif 1 < ` < k\n\nk\u2212`\n\nor we could have\nq = (0, xs1 , . . . , xs1 )\n\nif ` = 1\n\nIf q does have a 0 entry, then we exchange for q instead of v, we exchange for\nthe immediate successor of q instead of the immediate predecessor of v, and so\non until either we have exchanged out all of S\u03a9 or filled all of S\u03b2 . This creates a\nnew X 0 of the same size as X. Note that q is the only element of S\u03b2 which has\na 0 entry. We claim that at least one of the elements of S\u03a9 that we exchanged\nfor an element of S\u03b2 had a 0 entry. Indeed, if all of S\u03a9 is exchanged, we know\nthat u has a 0 entry. Otherwise, only the last t entries of S\u03a9 were exchanged,\nwhere x1 is the tth entry in the list 0, 1, \u22121, 2, \u22122, . . . . If none of them had a\n0 entry, then Lemma 3 would imply that one of the vectors in S\u03a9 has an entry\nequal to xs1 and another vector in S\u03a9 has that same entry equal to x1 . This\ncontradicts the fact that no element of S\u03a9 can share any entries with x.\nThus, at least one of the elements of S\u03a9 that we exchanged for an element\nof S\u03b2 had a 0 entry. Thus, by Lemma 2, we know that the boundary of the\nnew set X 0 is no larger than the boundary of X and that X 0 is closer to an\ninitial segment with respect to property 3 above. Thus, we have reached a\ncontradiction in Case 2.\nHence, X must indeed be an initial segment, and we have proved our Theorem.\n\n10\n\n\fWe note that the sets that we found here of minimum boundary are not\nunique. For example, the sets in Figure 2 are both sets in Z2 of size 10 of\nminimal boundary, but they are not isomorphic. The blue dots represent the set,\nwhile the red dots represent the additional vertices which are in the boundary\nof the set.\n\nFigure 1: The set on the left is an initial segment, while the set on the right is\nnot.\nFinally, we note that the same arguments utilized above can also be used to\nprove a similar isoperimetric inequality for Nk . That is, we consider the graph\nwhose vertex set is Nk such that there is an edge between x \u2208 Nk and y \u2208 Nk\nprecisely when kx \u2212 yk\u221e = 1. A well-ordering \u227aN is defined on Nk inductively\njust as it is for Zk , but with the base case of N1 being the standard ordering of\nN:\n0 < 1 < 2 < 3 < ***\nAll of the Lemmas and the Theorem are proven similarly. In the case of Nk ,\nthe equation of Lemma 2 would instead conclude that\n|\u2202(I \u222a {v})| = |\u2202I| + 2`\nwhere ` is the number of coordinates equal to 0 in v. With this well-ordering\n\u227aN , we have the following:\nCorollary 1. Let I be an initial segment in Nk , and A a finite, nonempty\nsubset. If |I| = |A| then |\u2202I| \u2264 |\u2202A|.\n\n3\n\nBoundary Computations\n\nWe define a graph on the vertex set Zk \u00d7 Nd , where k and d are non-negative\nintegers (not both 0). We use N to denote the set of non-negative integers:\nN = {x \u2208 Z : x \u2265 0}\nAs usual, we say that two vertices x, y \u2208 Zk \u00d7 Nd are joined by an edge precisely\nwhen their `\u221e -distance is 1. That is, when\nkx \u2212 yk\u221e =\n\nmax\n\n{|xi \u2212 yi |} = 1.\n\ni=1,2,...,k+d\n\n11\n\n\fFor simplicity, we introduce the following notation: for a real-valued vector\np = (p1 , p2 , . . . , pn ) \u2208 Rn , and x \u2208 R, we define\n(p, x \u2192 i) = (p1 , p2 , . . . , pi\u22121 , x, pi , pi+1 , . . . , pn ) \u2208 Rn+1\nIn words, (p, x \u2192 i) is the vector that results when placing x in the ith coordinate of p and shifting the ith through nth coordinates of p to the right.\nThere are two types of 1-dimensional compression which we will utilize.\nDefinition 1. We say that a set S \u2282 Zk \u00d7 Nd is centrally compressed in the\ni-th coordinate (1 \u2264 i \u2264 k) with respect to p \u2208 Zk\u22121 \u00d7 Nd if the set\n{x \u2208 Z : (p, x \u2192 i) \u2208 S}\nis either empty or of one of the following two forms:\n{x : \u2212a \u2264 x \u2264 a for a \u2208 N}\nOR\n{x : \u2212a \u2264 x \u2264 a + 1 for a \u2208 N}\nDefinition 2. We say that S \u2282 Zk \u00d7 Nd is downward compressed in the j-th\ncoordinate (k + 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k + d) with respect to p \u2208 Zk \u00d7 Nd\u22121 if the set\n{x \u2208 N : (p, x \u2192 j) \u2208 S}\nis either empty or of the form:\n{x : 0 \u2264 x \u2264 a for a \u2208 N}\nFor certain subsets S \u2282 Zk \u00d7 Nd , we will calculate the boundary\n\u2202S = {x \u2208 Zk \u00d7 Nd : ky \u2212 xk\u221e \u2264 1 for some y \u2208 S}\n\b\n= x \u2208 Zk \u00d7 Nd : \u2203 s \u2208 S such that x = s + \u000f for some \u000f \u2208 {\u22121, 0, 1}k+d\nSpecifically, we will calculate the boundary of sets which are centrally compressed in the ith coordinate with respect to any p \u2208 Zk\u22121 \u00d7 Nd for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k,\nand which are downward compressed in the jth coordinates with respect to any\np \u2208 Zk \u00d7 Nd\u22121 for k + 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k + d. We will say that such sets are \"compressed\nin every coordinate.\" Before completing the calculations, we shall see that a set\nof minimum boundary must be compressed in every coordinate.\n\n3.1\n\nEffect of Compression\n\nDefinition 3. Let S \u2282 Zk \u00d7Nd . For 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k, we define Si to be the ith central\ncompression of S by specifying its 1-dimensional sections in the ith coordinate.\nSpecifically,\n1.

Si is centrally compressed in the ith coordinate with respect to p for each\np \u2208 Zk\u22121 \u00d7 Nd .\nFor k + 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k + d, we define Sj to be the jth central compression of S by\nspecifying its 1-dimensional sections in the jth coordinate. Specifically,\n1. For each p \u2208 Zk \u00d7 Nd\u22121 ,\n|{x \u2208 N : (p, x \u2192 j) \u2208 Sj }| = |{x \u2208 N : (p, x \u2192 j) \u2208 S}|\n2. Sj is downward compressed in the jth coordinate with respect to p for each\np \u2208 Zk \u00d7 Nd\u22121 .\nIn words: after fixing a coordinate i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , k}, we consider all lines\nin Zk \u00d7 Nd where only the ith coordinate varies, and we intersect those lines\nwith S. Eeach of the points in those intersections are moved along the line so\nthat they are a segment centered around 0. The result is Si . Similarly, after\nchoosing j \u2208 {k + 1, . . . , k + d}, we again consider lines in Zk \u00d7 Nd where the\njth coordinate varies, and intersect those lines with S. We now move the points\nalong the line so that they are a segment starting from 0. The result is Sj .\nProposition 1. Suppose that S \u2282 Zk \u00d7 Nd .

If |S| = 1, then S = {(0, 0, 0, . . . , 0)}\nand\n\u2202S = {(x1 , x2 , . . . , xk+d ) : xi \u2208 {\u22121, 0, 1} for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k,\nxj \u2208 {0, 1} for k + 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k + d}\nso that\n|\u2202S| = 3k 2d\nWe note that in this case, |PI (S)| = 1 for any I \u2282 {1, 2, . . . , k + d} so that\nX\nX\n2|I\u2229K| |PI (S)| =\n2|I\u2229K|\nI\u2282{1,2,...,k+d}\n\nI\u2282{1,2,...,k+d}\n\n=\n\nk \u0012 \u0013\u0012 \u0013\nd X\nX\nk\nd\ni=0 j=0\n\nj\n\ni\n\n2j\n\n= 3k 2d\nNow suppose that |S| > 1. We consider the same well-ordering \u227a on Z as\nconsidered in Section 2:\n0 \u227a 1 \u227a \u22121 \u227a 2 \u227a \u22122 \u227a 3 * * *\nand we denote by < the regular ordering on either Z or N. As in Section 2, for\na \u2208 Z, we let a+ denote the element of {a, a + 1, a \u2212 1} which is largest in the\nwell-ordering \u227a and a\u2212 the element of {a, a + 1, a \u2212 1} which is the smallest.\nLet z = (z1 , z2 , . . . , zk+d ) \u2208 S be a point which is a \"corner point\" of S.\nThat is, for any i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , k}, the point\n(z1 , . . . , zi\u22121 , zi+ , zi+1 , . . . , zk+d )\n15\n\n\fis not in S and for any j \u2208 {k + 1, k2 , . . . , k + d}, the point\n(z1 , . . . , zj\u22121 , zj + 1, zj+1 , . . . , zk+d )\nis not in S. We note that z exists because S is finite. Also note that, since S is\ncompressed in every coordinate, for any i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , k} where zi 6= 0,\n(z1 , . . . , zi\u22121 , zi\u2212 , zi+1 , . . . , zk+d ) \u2208 S\nand\n(z1 , . . . , zi\u22121 , zi\u2212 , zi+1 , . . . , zk+d ) 6= (z1 , . . . , zi\u22121 , zi , zi+1 , . . . , zk+d )\nAdditionally, for any j \u2208 {k + 1, k + 2, . . . , d + k} where zj 6= 0,\n(z1 , . . . , zj\u22121 , zj \u2212 1, zj+1 , . . . , zk+d ) \u2208 S\nand\n(z1 , . . . , zj\u22121 , zj \u2212 1, zj+1 , . . . , zk+d ) 6= (z1 , . . . , zj\u22121 , zj , zj+1 , . . . , zk+d )\nBy induction,\n\u2202 (S\\{z}) =\n\nX\n\n2|I\u2229K| |PI (S\\{z})|.\n\nI\u2282{1,2,...,k+d}\n\nDefine\nZK = {i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , k} : zi = 0}\nand\nZD = {j \u2208 {k + 1, k + 2, . . . , k + d} : zj = 0}\nThen we note that the only points (y1 , y2 , . . . , yk+d ) which are in \u2202S but not in\n\u2202 (S\\{z}) are of the form\n\uf8f1\n\u22121, 0, or 1 if i \u2208 ZK\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2y +\nif i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , k}\\ZK\ni\nyi =\n\uf8f4\n0\nor\n1\nif i \u2208 ZD\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nyi + 1\nif i \u2208 {k + 1, k + 2, . . . , k + d}\\ZD\nThus, we can see that there are a total of\n3|ZK | 2|ZD |\npoints in \u2202S which are not in \u2202 (S\\{z}) so that\n|\u2202S| = |\u2202S\\{z}| + 3|ZK | 2|ZD |\nWe also note that since S is compressed in every coordinate, the only I \u2282\n{1, 2, . . . , k + d} for which |PI (S)| is larger than |PI (S\\{z})| must be of the\n16\n\n\fform I \u2282 ZK \u222a ZD . If I \u2282 ZK \u222a ZD , then |PI (S)| = |PI (S\\{z})| + 1 and if\nI 6\u2282 ZK \u222a ZD , then |PI (S)| = |PI (S\\{z})|. Thus, we see that\nX\nX\nX\n2|I\\ZD |\n2|I\u2229K| |PI (S)| =\n2|I\u2229K| |PI (S\\{z})| +\nI\u2282{1,2,...,k+d}\n\nI\u2282ZK \u222aZD\n\nI\u2282{1,2,...,k+d}\n|ZK | |ZD | \u0012\n\n= \u2202 (S\\{z}) +\n\nXX\nj=0 i=0\n\n|ZD |\ni\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\n\u0013\n|ZK | j\n2\nj\n\n= \u2202 (S\\{z}) + 3|ZK | 2|ZD |\nand hence our Theorem is proven.\nWe note that, in light of Theorem 1 and Theorem 2, we have the following\nCorollary:\nCorollary 2. Let Xn denote the set of all subsets X \u2282 Zk of size n.

Let Yn denote the set of all subsets Y \u2282 Nk of size n. Define the\nfunction f : Yn \u2192 R as follows: for Y \u2208 Yn ,\nX\nf (Y ) =\n|PI (Y )|.\nI\u2282{1,2,...,k}\n\nThe minimum value of this function is achieved at an initial segment of Nk of\nsize n, according to the well-ordering \u227aN\n\n4\n\nFinal Remarks\n\nThe calculations in Section 3 allow us to understand some of the behavior of\nthe boundaries of sets in our graph. These calculations rely on the technique\nwhich we call centralization. While compression is a more powerful technique,\nit requires that sets of minimal boundary be nested. The process of centralizing\nand computing boundaries does not require that sets of minimal boundary have\nany particular form. Perhaps these ideas can be used in other situations where\nthe sets of minimal boundary are more complicated.\n\n17\n\n\fReferences\n[1] Rudolf Ahlswede and Ning Cai.
