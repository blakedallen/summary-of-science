Although one might naively expect \"macroscopic systems\"\n(i.e. ones whose characteristic actions, I, are large compared to h\u0304) to behave classically, for systems with Hamiltonian chaos, Berry and Balazs have argued that the\nsemiclassical approximation may break down in an exceedingly short time, logarithmic in I/h\u0304 [1]. Understanding how classical chaotic behavior emerges from the underlying quantum description is a fundamental problem\nin physics. The study of quantum nonlinear dynamics for\napplication to quantum information processing [2] and\nfeedback control [3] provides further motivation to pursue a deeper understanding of the quantum to classical\ntransition in chaotic systems. Finally, the experimental state of the art is rapidly progressing to the situation\nwhere individual quantum systems can be monitored in a\ncontrolled way [4, 5, 6] necessitating a parallel theoretical\ndevelopment.\nIn previous studies, the quantum to classical transition was analyzed by comparing distributions in phase\nspace [7]. It has been shown that the process of decoherence due to interaction with an environment can suppress\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: sghose1@unm.edu\nAddress: School of Science, Griffith University, Nathan\n4111, Australia\n\n\u2020 Present\n\nquantum interference so that the quantum quasiprobability distribution remains close to the corresponding classical phase space distribution [8]. Here we extend a different approach taken in Ref. [9] to define the emergence\nof classical dynamics. Given an experiment in which the\ndynamical system is continuously observed, we ask under what conditions the measurement record is faithfully\npredicted by the classical dynamical equations of motion\n(e.g. Hamilton's equations). In a fundamentally quantum system the continuous measurement has two basic\neffects: (i) through knowledge gained in the observation\nthe state is localized to within the resolution of the measurement, (ii) backaction noise is imparted to the conjugate variables consistent with the quantum informationdisturbance relations. Classical dynamics will provide\na good approximation to the measurement record only\nwhen the localization is sufficiently strong so that trajectories can be defined in phase space and the backaction\nnoise is sufficiently weak so that these trajectories are\nbarely disturbed. In general, this balance can be struck\nfor a sufficiently macroscopic system. The scale of action relative to h\u0304 at which this occurs characterizes the\nquantum/classical dynamical boundary.\nA quantitative description of the time evolving continuous measurement record can be made using the quantum trajectory formalism [10]. Bhattacharya, Habib,\nand Jacobs [9] were able to find the conditions that\nachieve the strong-localization/weak-backaction balance.\nThe system they studied was the Duffing oscillator - a\ndriven nonlinear system with one dynamical degree of\nfreedom. We seek to generalize this analysis to coupled systems with multiple degrees of freedom and no\n\n\f2\nexternal classical driving force. New questions arise for\nsuch coupled quantum systems. Since the scale of the\naction relative to h\u0304 can differ for the different subsystems, one can explore a regime where one degree of freedom has a large action while another is deeply quantum. It is known that such approximate mixed quantum/classical, or \"semiclassical\", systems can exhibit signatures of chaos [11, 12, 13, 14]: We wish to investigate whether such a description can apply in a real experiment. Another interesting question is whether the\nquantum entanglement of the different degrees of freedom plays a role in the approach to the classical regime.\nWe consider a dynamical system consisting of a particle whose motion in a harmonic well is coupled to its spin.\nThis has wide applicability to a variety of phenomena including generalizations of the Jaynes-Cummings model\nin quantum optics (coupling of an atomic pseudo-spin\nto a harmonic mode of the electromagentic field) [15],\nthe spin-boson model of condensed matter systems (e.g.\npolariton transport) [16, 17], and the motion of ultracold atoms in magneto-optical traps [18]. In previous\nwork [19], we considered an integrable regime in which\nthe Hamiltonian exhibits only regular motion. In the\ncurrent paper we extend our analysis to the classically\nchaotic regime. In particular, we study when the classical Lyapunov exponents are recovered from the quantum\ntrajectories. This gives an unambiguous signature of the\nemergent chaotic behavior.\nThe paper is organized as follows. We start by describing the coupled motion-spin Hamiltonian in Sec. II.\nThe evolution of the system conditioned on a weak continuous measurement can be described using a stochastic Schr\u00f6dinger equation as outlined in Sec. III A. We\npresent our numerical results for the evolution of the\nmeasured quantum system, starting with the spin-1/2\nsystem (Sec. III B), and then moving to the large spin\nlimit (Sec. III C). Analytical conditions for the recovery\nof classical dynamics are obtained in Sec. IV by bounding\nthe nonclassical covariance matrix and thereby showing\nthat corrections to the classical trajectories always remain small. In Sec. V we compute the largest Lyapunov\nexponent of the quantum trajectories and compare it to\nthe classical value in order to quantitatively demonstrate\nthe emergence of classical chaos. We conclude with a\nbrief summary of our primary results in Sec. VI.\nII.\n\nTHE COUPLED SYSTEM OF SPIN AND\nMOTION\n\nThe Hamiltonian we consider here is\n\u0124 =\n\np\u03022\n1\n+ m\u03c9 2 \u1e91 2 + b\u1e91 J\u02c6z + cJ\u02c6x ,\n2m 2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u1e91 is the position operator of a particle of mass m\ntrapped in a harmonic well of frequency \u03c9 and J\u02c6i are the\ncomponents of the particle's spin angular momentum. In\naddition to the trap, the spin is coupled to an effective\n\nmagnetic field with a constant transverse (x-direction)\ncomponent and gradient along the longitudinal (z-) direction. We can make the analogy to a classical Hamiltonian\nby replacing the spin with a classical magnetic moment\nof magnitude \u03bc = \u03b3J, where \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio,\ninteracting with the local field B(z) = \u2212 (cex + bzez ) /\u03b3\nvia \u2212\u03bc * B(z). For this classical analog system, coupling\nbetween the direction of the magnetic moment and the\nposition of the particle in the wells can lead to chaotic\nmotion in a spatially inhomogeneous field [20, 21].\nThe expectation values of the Heisenberg equations obtained from Eq. (1) are\n\nhp\u0302i\nd h\u1e91i\n=\n,\ndt\nm\nD E\nd hp\u0302i\n= \u2212m\u03c9 2 h\u1e91i \u2212 b J\u02c6z ,\nDdtE\nD E\nd \u0134\n= \u03b3 \u0134 \u00d7 B (h\u1e91i) + \u03b3C\u0134\u00d7B(\u1e91) ,\ndt\n\n(2)\n\nwhere\nE D E\nD\nC\u0134\u00d7B(\u1e91) = \u0134 \u00d7 B(\u1e91) \u2212 \u0134 \u00d7 B(h\u1e91i)\n\n(3)\n\nis the covariance or the second cumulant. In general,\nthese correlations are non-zero, so that the quantum expectation values do not follow the classical trajectories.\nAs we will see, in the small h\u0304 limit, continuous measurement can act to damp the higher order cumulants with\nnegligible quantum backaction noise thereby recovering\nclassical dynamics.\nA special case to consider is when the action associated\nwith center-of-mass dynamics is large enough such that,\nwere there no coupling between the two degrees of freedom, the motion in the harmonic wells could be treated\nclassically while the uncoupled spin would still be deeply\nquantum. In the coupled system, should we continue to\nassume that the motional subsystem can be treated classically and treat the position and momentum operators\napproximately as c-numbers, then CJ\u00d7B \u2248 0. This leads\nto the \"semiclassical\" Heisenberg equations of motion,\nwhich have exactly the same form as the classical Hamilton's equations with h\u1e91i \u2192 z, etc. If this approximation\nwere correct it would imply that dynamics in this regime\nmay also exhibit chaos as has been studied in various\ncontexts [11, 12, 13, 14]. The validity of this approximation and the resulting chaos has been questioned in\n[22, 23]. One of our goals in this article is to investigate\nwhether this \"semiclassical chaos\" can be recovered in\nthe quantum trajectories, obtained when the system is\nweakly observed.\n\n\f3\nIII.\n\nCONTINUOUS MEASUREMENT OF\nPOSITION\nA.\n\nConditioned Dynamics\n\nUsing the formalism of generalized measurements, we\nmodel a weak continuous observation of the particle's position via a stochastic Schr\u00f6dinger equation (SSE) that\ndescribes\nE the evolution of the unnormalized wave function \u03c8\u0303 , conditioned on a record of the position,\n\u001a\u0012\n\u0013\nE\n1\n2\nd \u03c8\u0303 =\nH \u2212 k z dt +\nih\u0304\n\u0011 o E\n\u0010\n\u221a\n(4)\n4k hzi dt + 2kdW z \u03c8\u0303 .\n\nThis general form of the SSE for a continuous measurement, described by a Wiener process dW of \"strength\nk\" and yielding a record hzi + (8k)\u22121/2 dW/dt has been\npreviously derived for the specific case in which the position of a moving mirror is monitored by an optical\nprobe [24, 25]. Scott and Milburn [26] obtained a similar\nequation for simultaneous measurements of position and\nmomentum using previous results on continuous position\nmeasurement operators [27, 28].\nWe evolve the SSE numerically using a \"split operator\"\nmethod [29, 30]\n\u2212M dt\n\ni\n\n\u2212M dt\n\n|\u03c8(t + dt)i = e 2 e\u2212 h\u0304 Hdt e 2 |\u03c8(t)i ,\n(5)\nE\nwhere |\u03c8i and \u03c8\u0303 differ only in normalization.

The potential operator, block\ntri-diagonal in the basis of position and Jz eigenstates,\ncan be calculated using efficient algorithms for inverting such matrices [31, 32]. As usual, the kinetic term is\napplied in the momentum basis using Fast Fourier Transforms. In order to increase the efficiency of our numerical\ncode we use a small grid in position and momentum adaptively centered around the location of the wave function.\n\nWe pick the spin direction to be along x so that (\u03b8, \u03c6) =\n(\u03c0/2, 0) (though any other direction would have been\nequally suitable), the initial momentum to be zero,\nand the initial position to be z(0) \u2248 38zgp\n, with b =\nm\u03c9 2 \u2206z/J, and \u2206z \u2248 22zg where zg =\nh\u0304/2m\u03c9 is\nthe width of the harmonic oscillator ground state. For\nthese choices, the action in the motional phase space\nI0 = m\u03c9\u2206z 2 = 250h\u0304. This puts us in the mixed\nquantum-classical regime described in Sec. II. The transverse magnetic field is chosen so that c = 200Eg /J,\nwhere Eg = h\u0304\u03c9/2 is the ground state energy. We pick a\nmeasurement strength k = \u03c9/20zg2 that satisfies the inequalities for strong-localization/weak-backaction found\nin Ref. [9] in the absence of coupling to the spin. This\nenables us to study how the coupling to the spin changes\nthe effect of the measurement.\nDifferences between quantum and classical trajectories\narise from two possible sources, nonclassical initial states\nand nonclassical dynamics. For the integrable regime\nthat we studied previously [19], the system was linear,\nand therefore the quantum and classical propagators were\nequivalent. Thus, only the difference between the quantum and classical initial state was responsible for any\ndisparities between the quantum and classical trajectories [19]. For the nonlinear dynamics considered here, the\nclassical and quantum equations of motion for the higher\ncumulants differ, and because of severe quantization effects for small spin, the wave function distribution is far\nfrom gaussian, making the cumulant expansion of limited\nutility.\nThe time evolving measurement record of the position\nof the spin-1/2 system is compared to the trajectory predicted by the classical equations of motion in Fig. 1. Consider first the classical dynamics. Note that even though\nthere is a transverse magnetic field, the motion is regular, not chaotic. This can be understood by writing the\nclassical equations of motion as,\ndz\u0303\nd\u03c4\ndp\u0303\nd\u03c4\ndnx\nd\u03c4\ndny\nd\u03c4\ndnz\nd\u03c4\n\n= p\u0303,\n= \u2212z\u0303 \u2212 nz ,\n= \u2212\n\nI0\nz\u0303ny ,\nJ\n\nI0\nI0\nz\u0303nx \u2212 c\u0303 nz ,\nJ\nJ\nI0\n= c\u0303 ny ,\nJ\n=\n\n(8)\n\nwhere\nB.\n\nThe spin-1/2 system\n\nWe start by investigating the conditioned evolution of\na spin J = 1/2 system. We choose the initial state to\nbe a product of a coherent state for the motion (position\nand momentum phase plane) and a spin coherent state\n(direction (\u03b8, \u03c6) on the Bloch sphere),\n|\u03c8(0)i = |\u03b1 = z + ipi |\u03b8, \u03c6i .\n\n(7)\n\nz\u0303\np\u0303\nI0\nc\u0303\n\u03c4\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nz/\u2206z,\np/m\u03c9\u2206z,\nm\u03c9\u2206z 2 ,\ncJ/m\u03c9 2 \u2206z 2 ,\n\u03c9t,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere n is the direction of the magnetic moment. We can\nsee from these equations that the dynamics depends on\n\n\f4\nthe ratio of the actions of the coupled subsystems. In the\nclassical limit, both external and internal actions I0 and\nJ are infinitely large relative to h\u0304, but the ratio of the\ntwo is finite. For the \"semiclassical\" regime considered\nhere, I0 /J = 500. The large disparity between the actions of the external and internal dynamics separates the\ntime scales of the position and magnetic moment evolutions, effectively decoupling the spin from its motion\nin the well. This leads to a regime where the magnetic\nmoment can adiabatically follow the changing magnetic\nfield direction. The angle between the magnetic moment\ndirection and the local magnetic field becomes an additional constant of motion apart from the energy, giving\nrise to integrable motion.\n(a)\n\n60\n40\n\nz/zg\n\n20\n0\n\n-20\n-40\n-60\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\nwt\n\n15\n\n20\n\n(b)\n1300\n\nU/Eg\n\n1100\n900\n700\n500\n300\n100\n-40\n\n-20\n\n0\nz/zg\n\n20\n\nof adiabatic eigenstates |\u00b1(z)i, obtained by diagonalizing\nthe total potential at each position,\n|\u03c8(0)i = |\u03b1i |\u03b8, \u03c6i = (\u03c6+ (z) |+(z)i+\u03c6\u2212 (z) |\u2212(z)i). (10)\nAt the initial time, the \u03c6+ (z) and \u03c6\u2212 (z) components\noverlap in space, but are pulled apart by the differential\nforce of the upper and lower adiabatic potentials (dashed\nlines in Fig. 1(a)). As the wavepacket splits, the overlap\nbetween \u03c6+ and \u03c6\u2212 gradually decreases and eventually,\nwhen the position measurement can resolve the two spatially separated components, the state is projected into\none of the two quantum adiabatic eigenstates. This contrasts with the classical adiabatic motion which moves on\nan average of these two quantum potentials (Fig. 1(b)).\nThus, due to the entanglement between motion and spin,\nthe weak measurement of position results in a projective measurement of the spin, much like the situation\nfor the spin-1/2 particle with c = 0 [19]. The difference\nhere is that the pointer basis associated with the measurement appartus is the adiabatic basis rather than the\nmagnetic sublevels associated with the space-fixed quantization axis.\nWe have thus shown that a continuously observed system in a mixed quantum-classical regime does not follow\nthe classical trajectory. This divergence of the two time\nseries occurs even in the absence of chaos and is simply a\nstatement that there is no smooth classical limit for lowspin systems. To explore the chaotic regime, we must\nreduce the ratio of the two actions in Eq. (8). However,\nfor a spin-1/2 system, this requires reduction of the external action to values that violate the conditions required\nfor classical dynamics given in Ref. [9]. This means that\nboth the predicted regular and chaotic classical trajectories in the \"semiclassical\" spin-1/2 description cannot be\nseen in the measured dynamics.\n\n40\n\nFIG. 1: (a) Mean position of the measured spin-1/2 system (solid) in a single quantum trajectory with \u2206z \u2248 22zg ,\nc/J = 200Eg , k = \u03c9/20zg2 . Outer solid curves show the\nvariance of the wave function. The measurement backaction\ncauses the quantum trajectory to diverge from the classical\n(dotted, black) trajectory. This is because part of the wave\nfunction moves along the upper adiabatic potential while the\nrest moves along the lower adiabatic potential (dashed red\ncurves in (b)). Eventually, the measurement collapses the\nwave function into the upper or lower potential (solid blue\nline in (b)). The classical motion is along the dashed-dotted\npotential in (b).\n\nFig. 1 also shows a typical measured quantum trajectory of the spin-1/2 system. After a very short time,\nit fails to follow the classical adiabatic motion described\nabove. This behavior can be understood in a manner\nsimilar to that presented in our previous study of linear\ndynamics, with no transverse magnetic field [19]. Here,\nthe initial wave function can be decomposed in the basis\n\nC.\n\nThe large spin limit\n\nThe classical equations of motion result in chaotic dynamics when the time scales of the internal and external\ndynamics are on the same order. With this in mind we\nset I0 /J = 5 and c\u0303 = 0.4 in the equations of motion\n(Eq. (8)). The classical phase space for these parameters is mixed, with regions of stable motion separated by\nstochastic layers. We show in this section that this classical chaotic behavior can be recovered from the measured\nquantum system in the large action limit.\nFigs. 2(a,b) show two classical trajectories, one of\nwhich is in a regular part of the phase space, and the\nother in the chaotic region. The corresponding quantum\ntrajectories are shown in Figs. 2(c,d) for a spin with an\naction J = 200 and measurement strength k = \u03c9/8zg2.\nWe pick \u2206z \u2248 45zg which results in a ratio of characteristic actions in the quantum system that is the same\nas the classical ratio I0 /J = 5.

In the limit of large actions, the asterisks\nin Fig. 3 show how quantum trajectories follow different\nclassical periodic orbits. It is possible for the noise due to\nthe measurement to cause a quantum trajectory moving\non a periodic orbit to drift into the chaotic region and\nhence cross a KAM surface. However, as the spin becomes larger and larger, the noise becomes smaller and\nsmaller, eventually becoming negligible in the extreme\nclassical limit and it becomes increasingly unlikely for\nthe quantum trajectory to cross a KAM boundary.\n18\n\n-100\n\n-50\n\n0\n\nz/z g\n\n50\n\n100\n\n-100\n\n-50\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n9\n\nz/zg\n\nFIG. 2: Regular and chaotic classical trajectories (a,b) are\nrecovered in the quantum trajectories (c,d) with J = 200h\u0304,\n\u2206z \u2248 45zg , k = \u03c9/8zg2 .\n\npling to the spin. The initial quantum state is chosen\nto be a product of a coherent state in position and momentum, centered at the classical initial values, and a\nspin coherent state pointing in the same direction as the\ninitial classical magnetic moment. In Fig. 2, the initial conditions for the regular quantum trajectory were\nz(0) = 76zg , p(0) = 0 and (\u03b8, \u03c6) = (\u03c0, 0). The initial conditions for the chaotic quantum trajectory were\nz(0) = 89zg , p(0) = 0,(\u03b8, \u03c6) = (\u03c0, 0).\nThe quantum trajectories in Fig. 2 successfully reproduce the classical mixed phase space. This is because\nfor J = 200, there are 2J + 1 = 401 adiabatic potentials rather than just two as in the spin-1/2 case. The\ninitial state is in a superposition of the 401 eigenstates,\nbut has most of its support concentrated on just a few\nof the adiabatic potentials closest to the local direction\nof the classical magnetic moment. The differential force\nis thus very weak and only slightly splits the wavepackets into nonoverlapping components. The position measurement acts only to damp the tails of the distribution\nwhere spread is substantial and keeps the wave function\nlocalized. It does not, however, strongly project the spin\nstate into a single adiabatic state. A weak measurement\nof the position also acts as a weak measurement of the\nspin so that the strong localization and weak backaction\nconditions can simultaneously be satisfied for both the\nposition and the spin.\nA further qualitative example of the quantum trajectories recovering different structures in the mixed classical\nphase space is shown in Fig. 3.

This represents the first\nsuch calculation for the case of coupled degrees of freedom \u2013 spin and motion \u2013 with an undriven Hamiltonian\nwhose classical dynamics can exhibit chaos. In the mixed\nquantum-classical regime, with large motional action and\nsmall spin, the continuous measurement cannot simultaneously satisfy the conditions of strong localization\nand weak noise, thereby making it impossible to observe\n\"semiclassical chaos\". In the large spin limit, both conditions for classicality can be simultaneously satisfied. We\ncomputed a Lyapunov exponent directly from the measured quantum trajectories that agrees with the largest\nclassical Lyapunov exponent, thus showing the quantitative correspondence of classical and quantum trajectories. We also obtained general conditions for recovering\nclassical dynamics from the measurement trajectories by\nstudying the evolution of the covariance matrix. These\nmeasure the quantum coherence that is delocalized across\nphase space and thus cause differences between the quan-\n\n\f8\ntum and classical propagators. While we can solve for the\ncovariance matrix analytically in the integrable regime,\nfor the chaotic case we solved the problem numerically.\nWhereas coupled degrees on freedom can lead to chaos\nthe classical level, at the quantum level nonseparable\nHamiltonians will generally lead to entanglement between the different subsystems (here motion and spin).\nEntanglement is generally considered to be the feature\nwhich distinguishes quantum states from their classical\n\ncounterparts. It is thus natural to explore how the entanglement in our system varies as classical dynamics is\nrecovered in the measured quantum trajectories. As in a\npure system entanglement is as good a measure of correlation as the covariance, it might be useful to study the\napproach to classicality in terms of this complementary\nvariable instead. We plan to explore this possibility in\nmore detail in future work.\n\n[1] M. V. Berry and N. L. Balazs, J. Phys. A: Math. Gen.\n12, 625 (1979).\n[2] M. A. Nielsen and I. L.
