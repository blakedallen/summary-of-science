The mathematical tool for such a description\nis given by a Langevin equation, which in the overdamped\nlimit typically takes the form\n\u1e8b(t) = f (x) + \u03b6(t).\n\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\nbartek@th.if.uj.edu.pl\nigor.sokolov@physik.hu-berlin.de\nachechkin@kipt.kharkov.ua\n\n\u03c6(k) = exp [\u2212\u03c3 \u03b1 |k|\u03b1 ] .\n\n(2)\n\nThe parameter \u03b1 (where \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 2]) is the stability index\nof the distribution describing, for \u03b1 < 2, the asymptotic\ndecay of its tails\n\n(1)\n\nIn Eq. (1) f (x) stands for the deterministic force, while\n\u03b6(t) is the stochastic force - noise - describing interactions of a test particle with its complex surrounding.\nCommonly, it is assumed that the stochastic force is of\nthe white type, for example representing the particle's\ncollisions with molecules of the bath. Following Generalized Central Limit Theorem, a large number of independent collisions will lead to white noise of the stable type,\ni.e. either to Gaussian noise or to more general L\u00e9vy\nnoise. The presence of fluctuations distributed according\nto L\u00e9vy laws have been observed in various situations\nin physics, chemistry or biology [1, 2], paleoclimatology\n[3] or economics [4]. The situations pertinent to heavytailed distributions appear in context of different models\n[5\u20138], and are analyzed in an increasing number of studies\n[9\u201323].\nThe action of white L\u00e9vy noise leads to increments\nof the stochastic process which are distributed according to \u03b1-stable L\u00e9vy type distributions. Symmetric L\u00e9vy\n\n\u2217\n\ndistributions p\u03b1 (x; \u03c3) are characterized by their Fouriertransforms\nR \u221e (characteristic functions of the distributions)\n\u03c6(k) = \u2212\u221e eikx p\u03b1 (x; \u03c3)dx being [24\u201326]\n\np\u03b1 (x) \u221d |x|\u2212(1+\u03b1) .\n\n(3)\n\nFinally, \u03c3 is the scale parameter which controls the overall distribution width. The Gaussian distribution corresponds\u221ato a special case of a L\u00e9vy stable law with \u03b1 = 2\nwhen 2\u03c3 is interpreted as the standard deviation of the\ndistribution. In more general cases, for \u03b1 < 2, the variance of \u03b1-stable densities diverges. For \u03b1 < 1, the mean\nvalue of \u03b1-stable densities also does not exist.\nThe present work addresses properties of L\u00e9vy flights\nin external potentials. Theoretical descriptions of such\nsystems is based on the Langevin equation and/or\nFokker-Planck equation, which is of the fractional order\n[27]. The research performed here extends earlier studies\n[9, 19\u201321] where analysis of L\u00e9vy flights in harmonic and\nsuperharmonic potentials has been presented. The discussion conducted there did not account for the problem\nof existence of stationary states in potential less steep\nthan parabolic, which is the main topic of the present\nwork. This issue is addressed here by the use of analytical arguments and Monte Carlo simulations.\nThe model under discussion is presented in Section II.\nSection III discusses obtained results.

Such a choice\nis based on statistical properties of searched densities. As\nwe proceed to show, for subharmonic potentials, if stationary states exist, the tail of the corresponding probability density function P (x) is \"fatter\" than the tail of\nthe corresponding \u03b1-stable density. In such a case confining the numerical solution of equation (6) to a finite\ninterval may introduce uncontrollable errors. Therefore,\nin our simulations, we rely solely on stochastic representation of the fractional Fokker-Planck equation (6) which\nis provided by Eq. (4).\nIn the \u03b1 = 2 case (Gaussian noise) the stationary solution for Eq.

The situation drastically changes\nfor L\u00e9vy noises with \u03b1 < 2. Stationary states always\nexist in potentials steeper than the parabolic one [19\u2013\n21, 41]. However, as it will be shown this is no more the\ncase for subharmonic potentials.\n\nA.\n\nParabolic and quartic potentials\n\nThere are two special cases of power-law potentials for\nwhich the stationary solution can be given in a closed\nform: the case of a parabolic potential (for any 0 < \u03b1 6\n2) and the case of a quartic potential for \u03b1 = 1 and\n\n\u2202 P\u0302 (k, t)\n= \u00db (k)P\u0302 (k, t) \u2212 \u03c3 \u03b1 |k|\u03b1 P\u0302 (k, t).\n\u2202t\n\n(8)\n\nIn Eq. (8) \u00db (k) denotes the operator related to the\nFourier representation of the potential V (x) [21].\nFor the parabolic potential V (x) = x2 /2 the expression\n\u2202\nfor \u00db (k) reads \u00db (k) = \u2212k \u2202k\n. For symmetric \u03b1-stable\nnoises, the stationary probability density fulfills [19, 20]\n\u2202 P\u0302 (k)\n= \u2212\u03c3 \u03b1 signk|k|\u03b1\u22121 P\u0302 (k).\n\u2202k\n\n(9)\n\nThe solution of Eq.

(2), characterized by a different value of the\nscale parameter than the noise in Eq. (4). The scale parameter of the stationary density is \u03c3/\u03b11/\u03b1 . For \u03b1 < 2,\nthe variance of the stationary solution diverges and the\nparabolic potential is not sufficient to produce bounded\nstates, i.e. states characterized by a finite variance [9, 19\u2013\n21, 40].\nFor the quartic potential V (x) = x4 /4 the expression\n\u22023\nfor \u00db (k) reads \u00db (k) = k \u2202k\nThe stationary density\n3.\nfulfills\n\u2202 3 P\u0302 (k)\n= \u03c3 \u03b1 signk|k|\u03b1\u22121 P\u0302 (k).\n\u2202k 3\n\n(11)\n\n\f4\n6\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n1\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\nqy-q1-y\n\n| q...|\n\n3\n\nqy-q1-y\n\nFc (x)=1-F(x)\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1/t\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n6\n\nx\n\n8\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n12\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\nt\n\n4\n\n10\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\nt\n\n4\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n10\n\n5\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\nqy-q1-y\n\n| q...|\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n10\n\nqy-q1-y\n\nFc (x)=1-F(x)\n\n2\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1/t\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n4\n\nx\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n8\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\nt\n\n4\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\nt\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n-1\n\nFc (x)=1-F(x)\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n| q...|\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1/t\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n4\n\nx\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n8\n\n10\n\nFIG. 5.

This is typical for system\ndriven by L\u00e9vy white noises with the stability index \u03b1 < 2\n[47]. The stationary state, see Eq.

The scale parameter \u03c3\nis set to \u03c3 = 1.\n\nand the harmonic potential (c = 2). As it was indicated\nin the previous subsection for the harmonic potential, the\nstationary state is an \u03b1-stable L\u00e9vy type distribution, see\nEqs. (2) and (10). In the force free case the stationary\nsolutions do not exist. The time dependent solutions\nare just L\u00e9vy stable distributions with the growing scale\nparameter \u03c3, i.e. \u03c3(t) = \u03c3t1/\u03b1 . This observation suggests\nthat for intermediate values of the exponent c (0 < c < 2)\nthere should be a transition between the situation when\nthe stationary state exists and the situation when the\nstationary state is absent.\nIt is possible to obtain a necessary condition for the\nexistence of the stationary state using qualitative arguments based on the FFPE (6). If a stationary state for\nEq. (6) exists, it satisfies\n\u0014\n\u0015\nd \u2032\nd\u03b1\nP (x) = 0.\n(14)\nV (x) + \u03c3 \u03b1\ndx\nd|x|\u03b1\nAssuming that tails of the distribution are given by a\npower-law, i.e. P (x) \u221d |x|\u2212\u03bd as |x| \u2192 \u221e, the first term\nin Eq.

The asymptotics of the fractional derivative of\na probability density has a universal behavior independent of the particular form of this density. Indeed, its\nbehavior for x \u2192 \u221e is governed by the behavior of its\nFourier-transform \u2212|k|\u03b1 P\u0302 (k) for k \u2192 0. Due to the normalization condition P\u0302 (k = 0) = 1.

Consequently,\nwe get c \u2212 2 \u2212 \u03bd = \u22121 \u2212 \u03b1 and\n\u03bd = c + \u03b1 \u2212 1.\n\n(17)\n\nTherefore a stationary state is asymptotically characterized by a power-law\nP (x) \u221d |x|\u2212(c+\u03b1\u22121) ,\n\n(18)\n\ni.e. by the same expression as for the superharmonic\npotentials [21]. The probability density function P (x)\nhas to be integrable, which corresponds to \u03bd > 1. Thus,\nthe necessary condition for the existence of the steady\nstate is\nc>2\u2212\u03b1\n\n(19)\n\n\u03b1 > 2 \u2212 c.\n\n(20)\n\nor\n\nFor the parabolic potential (c = 2), the exponent \u03bd reproduces the decay of the L\u00e9vy distribution (\u03bd = 1 + \u03b1),\nsee Eq. (10). For the quartic potential (c = 4) with \u03b1 = 1\nwe get \u03bd = 4, as follows from Eq. (13). The complementary Rcumulative density function (Fc (x) = 1 \u2212 F (x) =\nx\n1 \u2212 \u2212\u221e P (x\u2032 )dx\u2032 ) is thus asymptotically characterized\nby a power-law decay\nFc (x) \u221d x\u2212(c+\u03b1\u22122) .\n\n(21)\n\nHaving the condition (19), it is also possible to determine the dependence of the width of the stationary distribution w(\u03c3) on the noise strength \u03c3. Assuming that\nP (x) = w\u22121 f (x/w) can be expressed through a universal function f (\u03be) of a new, dimensionless, length variable \u03be = x/w (this assumption is reasonable due to the\nscale-free nature of the power-law potential), we change\nthe length variable to \u03be = x/w. For V (x) = |x|c (i.e.\nV \u2032 (x) \u221d c|x|c\u22121 , x 6= 0), we get\n\u0003\nd \u0002 c\u22121\nd\u03b1\nf (\u03be) = 0.\nc|\u03be| f (\u03be) + \u03c3 \u03b1 w\u22121\u2212\u03b1\nd\u03be\nd|\u03be|\u03b1\n(22)\nThe universal rescaled equation for f (\u03be)\nwc\u22121 w\u22122\n\n\u0003\nd\u03b1\nd \u0002 c\u22121\nc|\u03be| f (\u03be) +\nf (\u03be) = 0\nd\u03be\nd|\u03be|\u03b1\n\n(23)\n\ncan only be obtained if the width of distribution w(\u03c3) is\nthe solution of the following equation\nwc\u22123 = \u03c3 \u03b1 w\u22121\u2212\u03b1 .\n\n(24)\n\nCondition (24) assures that prefactors of both terms in\nEq. (22) scale similarly when \u03c3 is changed. Thus, from\nEq. (24) one obtains\nw(\u03c3) \u221d \u03c3 \u03b1/(c+\u03b1\u22122) .\n\n(25)\n\nIn the absence of the noise (\u03c3 \u2192 0) the solution P (x)\ncorresponds to the particle's position in the minimum of\nthe potential, P (x) = \u03b4(x), i.e. w(\u03c3) = 0. For c + \u03b1 < 2\nthe exponent in Eq. (25) is negative, and the distribution's width w(\u03c3) diverges for \u03c3 \u2192 0 which corresponds\nto a non-physical situation. Consequently, no stationary state is possible. On the contrary, for c + \u03b1 > 2\nthe exponent in Eq. (25) is positive and the distribution\nwidth is the increasing function of the scale parameter \u03c3.\nTherefore, the necessary condition of the existence of the\nsteady state, see Eq. (19), is confirmed by the condition\n(25).\nNote that the cases of parabolic and quartic potentials\nconfirm Eq. (25). For the parabolic potential (c = 2)\nwe get w(\u03c3) \u221d \u03c3, see Eq. (10). In the case of quartic\npotential (c = 4) with \u03b1 = 1 we get w(\u03c3) \u221d \u03c3 1/3 , see\nEq. (13). Moreover, it is also possible to discuss how\ndoes the relaxation time to the equilibrium depends on\nthe scale parameter \u03c3. To do this, we turn to Eq. (6) and\nrescale both the length (\u03be = x/w) and the time variables\n(\u03c4 = t/\u03c40 (\u03c3)), so that the rescaled solution to Eq. (6) is\na universal function. The rescaling of t corresponds to\n\u03c40 (\u03c3) \u221d [w(\u03c3)]3\u2212c = \u03c3 \u03b1(3\u2212c)/(c+\u03b1\u22122) .\n\n(26)\n\nIt indicates that the dependence on the scale parameter\n\u03c3 for the stability index \u03b1 close to 2 \u2212 c gets extremely\nsharp. In other words, when \u03b1 approaches 2 \u2212 c (from\nabove) the relaxation time grows and diverges at \u03b1 =\n2 \u2212 c.\nThe condition (19) for the existence of the steady state\ncan be corroborated by the following qualitative argument based on the decomposition of the noise into a\n\"background\" noise with finite variance, and \"bursts\" of\narbitrary amplitude [48, 49].\nLet us consider the discretized Langevin scheme with\nthe time step of integration \u2206t and the characteristic amplitude of the L\u00e9vy jumps \u01eb = \u03c3(\u2206t)1/\u03b1 . Additionally, let\nus introduce a cutoff level \u039b, so that only the jumps with\nthe amplitude a > \u039b are considered as bursts. The overall situation is then considered as pertinent to a perturbation of the equilibrium distribution of particles in the\npotential V (x) under the action of the background noise\n(i.e. the Boltzmann distribution in the potential V (x) at\nthe temperature kT \u2243 \u039b) by these distinct bursts. The\nwidth of this distribution W depends on the cutoff level\n\u039b and on the type of the potential. Moreover, we assume\nthat only very large bursts, with a \u226b \u039b, can be responsible for the absence of a stationary distribution. Therefore, the finite width of the background distribution can\nbe neglected when considering the action of such bursts.\nThe distribution of the burst amplitudes is then given by\nthe asymptotic behavior of tails of the symmetric L\u00e9vy\ndistribution\np(a) \u2243\n\n\u01eb\u03b1\nx1+\u03b1\n\n=\n\n\u03c3 \u03b1 \u2206t\n.\nx1+\u03b1\n\n(27)\n\nA burst of amplitude a brings the particle to a position\nx \u2248 a, and the typical time necessary to return to the\n\n\f6\ninterval of the characteristic width W is given by the\nsolution of the ordinary equation of motion\n\u1e8b(t) = \u2212V \u2032 (x).\n\n(28)\n\nFor c 6= 2, the return time T (a) into the equilibrium\ndomain, i.e. |x| < W , from the initial position x = a is\ngiven by\nT (a) =\n\n\u0003\n\u0002 2\u2212c\n1\na\n\u2212 W 2\u2212c .\nc(2 \u2212 c)\n\n(29)\n\nFor subharmonic potentials, 0 < c < 2, the return time\nT (a) is dominated by the initial position a. The leading contribution to T (a) is provided by the first term of\nEq. (29), i.e. a2\u2212c /[c(2 \u2212 c)]. Therefore, instead of the\nreturn time to the equilibrium domain it is possible to\nconsider the return time to the origin, which is finite and\nslightly larger than the return time to the characteristic\ndomain.\nIt is reasonable to assume, that the steady state does\nnot exist, if the time T (a) to return from the point a\nis larger than the typical time between two bursts of the\namplitude a or larger, and might exist in the opposite situation. The probability to have a burst of the amplitude\na or larger is\nZ \u221e\n\u0010 \u01eb \u0011\u03b1\nP (a) = 2\np(a\u2032 )da\u2032 \u2243\n,\n(30)\na\na\nso that the typical time between two such events is\n\u0010 a \u0011\u03b1\n.\n(31)\nT \u2243 \u2206t\n\u01eb\n\nComparing T with T (a) we conclude that the inequality\nT (a) < T applies and the stationary states are possible\nfor\nc > 2 \u2212 \u03b1.\n\n(32)\n\nFor superharmonic potentials, c > 2, the situation is\ninverse to the situation for subharmonic potentials. The\nlarger the initial displacement a is, the faster is the return\nto the W -domain. For the increasing initial displacement\na, the typical return time essentially tends to a constant\nvalue W 2\u2212c /[c(c \u2212 2)], while the time between two subsequent bursts grows with their amplitude a. Comparing T\nwith T (a), we conclude that stationary states for superharmonic potentials exist for every value of the stability\nindex \u03b1. The harmonic potential, c = 2, is the limiting\ncase for which the return time shows not a power-law but\na logarithmic dependence. In such a case, the very same\narguments proofing existence of stationary states hold.\n2.\n\nNumerical results.\n\nNumerical results were obtained by Monte Carlo simulations of Eq. (4) with the time step of integration\n\n\u2206t = 10\u22122 and averaged over N = 106 realizations\n[14, 15, 25, 26, 32]. Initially, at time t = 0 a test particle was located at the origin, i.e. x(0) = 0. Due to the\nsymmetry of the noise and of the potential, stationary\nstates are symmetric with respect to the origin; the median and modal values of stationary densities are located\nat the origin.\nOur test of stationarity is based on the quantiles of distributions. Quantiles of stationary distributions remain\nconstant. Consequently, plotting quantile values as functions of time (quantile lines) gives us the key to analyze\nstationarity. More precisely, if the quantile lines are parallel to the abscissa, it means that the stationary state\nhas been reached.\nIn order to verify performance of the test based on\nquantile lines we have constructed quantile lines for L\u00e9vy\nflights in the parabolic potential. In such a case the stationary state exists and is given by the \u03b1-stable density,\nsee Eq. (10). Therefore, quantile lines should be parallel to the abscissa. Analogously, interquantile distance\nshould not change over time. This behavior is indeed\nobserved, e.g. in the bottom panel of Fig. 2.\nFurthermore, Fig. 2 compares interquantile distance\n(left column) and complementaryR cumulative distribux\ntions Fc (x, t) = 1 \u2212 F (x, t) = 1 \u2212 \u2212\u221e P (x\u2032 , t)dx\u2032 (right\ncolumn) for the stability index \u03b1 = 0.9 and various potentials: V (x) = 0 (top panel), V (x) = |x| (middle panel)\nand V (x) = x2 /2 (bottom panel). From these cases only\nthe V (x) = x2 /2 case corresponds to the situation when\nstationary state exists. Top panel of Fig. 2 corresponds\nto the force free case in which no stationary density exists. In such a case, the interquantile distance grows like\nt1/\u03b1 . The middle panel of Fig. 2 corresponds to the intermediate case, i.e. V (x) = |x|. Numerical simulations\nindicate that for V (x) = |x| and \u03b1 = 0.9 no stationary\nstate exists as well, what is coherent with analytical arguments given above. Note that in all three cases the\ndecay of the probability densities follows the one of the\nnoise, albeit on different reasons. For free motion, this\ndecay follows the one of the noise due to the stability of\nthe process. For the case V (x) = |x|, where according to\nanalytical result the stationary state is absent, numerical\nsimulations suggest that the tail of the distribution function is still dominated by the properties of the noise, and\nfollows Fc (x) \u221d x\u2212\u03b1 pattern. Finally, for the parabolic\npotential it is essentially given by Fc (x) \u221d x\u2212(c+\u03b1\u22122) , i.e.\nagain by Fc (x) \u221d x\u2212\u03b1 for c = 2.\nConsecutive figures present results for subharmonic potentials.

(19) holds true. Even in this case the numerical verification whether stationary states exist or do\nnot exist, due to possible slow convergence to a stationary state, is not trivial, see discussion of Figs. 5 and 8\nbelow.\nThe probability densities for the system described by\nEqs. (4) and (6) are symmetric with respect to the origin.\nTherefore the quantile lines for qy and |q1\u2212y | overlap and\nare not distinguishable in left panels of Figs. 5 and 8.\nFor V (x) = |x|1.5 , Fig. 3 indicates that for sufficiently\nlarge values of the stability index \u03b1 stationary densities\nexist. Although all the values of stability indices shown\ncorrespond to the domain where stationary states are predicted to exist, the convergence to these states becomes\nslower when \u03b1 approaches 2 \u2212 c = 0.5 for V (x) = |x|1.5 .\nFig. 6 shows the very similar behavior for V (x) = |x|.\nHere again the relaxation time to the equilibrium gets\nlarger when \u03b1 approaches 2 \u2212 c = 1.\nFigures 4 and 7 present complementary cumulative distributions in the situation when Eq.

In the right column, solid\nlines present x\u2212(\u03b1\u22121) decay predicted by Eq. (21).\n\ndistributions should asymptotically decay as x\u2212(c+\u03b1\u22122) .\nIndeed, in Figs. 4 and 7 the decay predicted by Eq. (21)\nis observed.\nFigures 5 (\u03b1 = 0.7 and V (x) = |x|1.5 ) and 8 (\u03b1 = 1.3\nand V (x) = |x|) present quantile lines and complementary cumulative distributions for different values of the\nscale parameter \u03c3. The quantile lines are plotted as functions of 1/t in order to elucidate convergence. Thus, in\nFig. 5 the convergence of q0.9 is not achieved over the time\nof simulation for \u03c3 = 1, but is approached for \u03c3 = 0.01.\nCorrespondingly, the tail of the complementary cumulative density differs from theoretical predictions for \u03c3 = 1\nand approaches its theoretical asymptotics for \u03c3 = 0.01.\nThe same is true for the data in Fig. 8, where the convergence is achieved already for \u03c3 = 0.1. This indicates\nthat the problem of the slow convergence to the stationary state has to be taken seriously.\n\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe considered the problem of existence of stationary\nstates in power-law subharmonic potentials V (x) = |x|c ,\nc < 2, under the action of L\u00e9vy-stable noise characterized by the stability index \u03b1. The scaling analysis of the\nfractional Fokker-Planck equation leads us to the conclusion that such states exist if \u03b1 > 2 \u2212 c. This conclusion\nis corroborated by an alternative argument based on the\ndecomposition of the L\u00e9vy noise. For subharmonic potentials, the probability density functions of stationary\nstates are characterized by the asymptotic power-law decay P (x) \u221d |x|\u2212\u03bd = |x|\u2212(c+\u03b1\u22121) for |x| \u2192 \u221e, which is\nslower than decay of the tails of the corresponding L\u00e9vy\ndistributions. Monte Carlo simulations of the Langevin\n\n\f8\nequation confirm these analytical findings, at least for \u03b1\nnot too close to 2 \u2212 c. The convergence to the stationary\nstate for \u03b1 approaching 2 \u2212 c is very slow, which poses\nconsiderable numerical problems, since both long times\nand very small values of scaling parameter \u03c3 are required.\nHowever, for \u03c3 small enough the tendency to converge is\nstill observable.\n\nport from European Commission via MC IIF, grant\n219966 LeFrac.
