Transport in one-dimensional or quasi onedimensional molecular wires formed with self-assembled\ndiscotic molecules1,2,3,4,5,6,7 , nanotubes8,9 at high temperatures or with disorder, and MBE gate engineered\nconfined charged channels, constitutes currently a very\nhot and technically important topic10 . Other important\nsystems include 2- dimensional layers such as those encountered in smectic liquid crystals11,12 , gate charge injected or doped polymers13 , gate addressed FET devices\nbased on organic materials14 , thin film transistors, and\nsame such systems when they exhibit a metal insulator\ntransition and superconductors.\nOne-carrier conduction phenomena are now reasonably\nwell understood, and many workers are in the process of\ndesigning structures in order to exploit the subtle phenomena associated with one-carrier resonant tunnelling\nthrough large molecules15,16,17 . The molecules have energy levels structure which can be put in and out of resonance to the energy of the incoming waves. This can be\ndone using gates and nano-gates. The changes in these\nenergy levels caused by contamination or interaction or\nexternal fields can then be recorded as a new current-\n\nvoltage response and used in various device applications.\nAt the same time it is also well known that small lowdimensional structures are more susceptible to electronelectron interactions. As long as one is dealing with a\nfew steady state carriers which can escape before others arrive, mean-field approaches are in order. Simple\nminded mean-field approaches will however for obvious\nreasons not work in low-dimensional systems in which\ncarriers interfere seriously with each others pathways.\nInteractions are known, for example, to play a role in\ncarbon nanotubes at low temperatures, and we believe\nthat many ac response phenomena in conjugated polymers and molecular wires have in the past been wrongly\nattributed to pure disorder effects. In reality one is often\ndealing with a combination of both electron-electron interactions and disorder and it is not easy to differentiate\nthe two experimentally unless one has the right theoretical tools. Electronic interactions also come into play\nwith high charging, such as occur for example in electrode\nor gate charged FET organic interfaces14 and thin film\ntransistors. The same applies to highly doped materials.\nCharging energy is particularly important in high-band\ngap, low dielectric constant and low-dimensional molecular materials such as chemically or injection doped smectic and discotic liquid crystals1,2,3,4,11 .\nCharges can be injected into organic materials chemically or by high fields and by light and one can measure\n\n\f2\nF\nD\n\nsemiconducting\ndiscotic\nmaterial\n\nS\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\nmetal electrodes, which serve the purpose of source and\ndrain. The gate electrode lies at a distance of d=1 nm\nfrom the column, and its distance from the edge electrodes equals LG =1.4 nm. We have also considered the\nmore realistic situation that the gate electrode is d=30\nnm away from the column. A number N of charges (negative or positive, in our case negative) is placed along\nthis linear gate, which is parallel to the organic column.\nCharges (which can be either holes or electrons, and in\nour case we consider them to be holes) are created in the\ncolumn and move along its length under the influence of\nan externally applied field, which can be either DC or\nAC. These holes can enter or leave the column through\nthe metal electrodes, but asymptotically they establish a\nsteady-state distribution in the column.\n\n+\n\nd\n\nLG\n\nnon\u2212conducting\nsubstrate\n\nIn practice, we consider a column of 300 sites, with a\nlattice constant a = 0.35 nm, which corresponds to a 0.1\nmicron device. The number N of charges in the gate is\nfixed by the assumed value of the gate field near the plate\nright at the start and remains constant throughout the\nsimulation. We assume that the negative voltage at the\ngate causes an equal number of charges (holes) to appear\nin random positions in the column.\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic diagram of the gated model system. A\nmolecular wire is first charged by a gate, and the conduction\ntakes place along the molecular column between the source\n(S) and the drain (D).\n\nthe frequency dependent conductivity. The frequency dependent conductivity is in principle one of the easiest\nways of seeing the effect of interactions. The long range\ncoulomb forces produce, naively speaking, disorder-like\npotentials which confine and scatter the carriers. They\ngenerate in principle a frequency dependence on the motion which looks similar to the one produced by true disorder. The problem in practice is, however, that one\nalways has some disorder and some electrode polarisation effects, and then it is difficult to disentangle these\nprocesses from each other.\nII.\n\nThe Coulomb energy Vn (t) of a hole located on site\nwith index n at distance rn = na from the source electrode, is the sum of repulsive forces due to the presence of\nother holes and the attractive force due to the negatively\ncharged gate:\nL\ne2 X Hm (t)\n+Vn,att ,\n4\u03c0\u01eb0 \u01ebr m=1 |rn \u2212 rm |\n(1)\nwhere Hm (t) is the hole density of site m at time t, and\nassumes the values of 1 or 0, depending on whether this\nsite is occupied by a hole at time t.\n\nVn (t) = Vn,rep (t)+Vn,att =\n\nTHE COMPUTATIONAL MODEL\n\nUsing many particle Monte-Carlo simulations, we\nstudy the effect of charge-charge interactions on the\nac conductivity of finite and electrode addressed onedimensional chains following the work in reference 18.\nA schematic representation of the system is shown in\nfigure 1.

The jump frequency \u03bd0 is fixed\nto 1012 Hz. The external electric field F can either be\nconstant F0 =20 kV/cm, or oscillating with a period \u03c9\nso that F (t) = F0 cos(\u03c9t). When a neighboring site is\noccupied the transition rate towards that site is 0, i.e.\nwe use excluded volume rules.\nFor the first and last site of the column the quantity\n\u2206E is modified, since now there is only one neighbour\nto move to, and injection/absorption to the electrodes is\npossible. There exists an energy barrier between the valence band of the organic material and the Fermi level of\nthe metal electrode, whose height we denote by Eb . The\nenergy difference for a hole injection from the electrode\nto the first column site is\ninj\n\u2206En=1\n= Eb + V1 \u2212 eF a ,\n\n(5)\n\nand for hole injection from the other electrode to the\nopposite edge is\ninj\n\u2206En=L\n= Eb + VN + eF a .\n\n(6)\n\nIn the same way, the energy difference for absorption of\na hole at n = 1 to the adjacent electrode is\nabs\n\u2206En=1\n= \u2212Eb \u2212 V1 + eF a ,\n\n(8)\n\nThe case of Eb = \u221e corresponds to blocking barriers,\nwhere the number of holes in the system is fixed for the\nentire duration of the simulation and no hole can enter\nor leave the column.\nOnce the transition probabilities W have been computed for all holes in the system, the time \u03b4t required for\neach hop is drawn by an exponential distribution,\n\u03b4t =\n\n\u2212 ln R\n,\nWn,n\u22121 + Wn,n+1\n\nPn,n\u00b11 =\n\n(9)\n\nwith R being a uniformly distributed random variable,\nassuming values between 0 and 1. The shortest time\n\u03b4tmin of this ensemble (including the time needed for injection/absorption) is chosen and this jump takes place.\n\nWn,n\u00b11\n.\nWn,n\u22121 + Wn,n+1\n\n(10)\n\nWhen a hole moves from a site to another, the work done\nby the electric field during the time interval \u03b4tmin is calculated by \u03b4A = \u00b1eaF (t). The total work done over\na time interval is added to the total work \u2206A for that\ninterval.\nThe above procedure is repeated many times with the\nholes moving around, leaving and entering the column.\nThe time that a given realization of the system lasts depends on the convergence of the results, which in turn\ndepends on the specific parameters of the problem. Thus,\ntypical times simulated are in the range of 0.01-0.1 ms. In\norder to eliminate any initial distribution bias, we repeat\nthe whole algorithm for a number of different realizations\n(typically of the order of 10-100), with different random\ninitial configurations. During all these realizations we\nmonitor the average of the holes mobility \u03bc in the system with time, until this average is well converged. In\nalmost all cases, the error bars for the mobility estimation were less than 10%.\nThe number of holes Nh in the column is a number\nwhich varies with time and converges asymptotically to\nan average value, depending on the exact simulation conditions. When we use blocking electrodes, of course, Nh\nis always equal to N , the number of negative charges in\nthe gate.\nThe average hole mobility \u03bc is calculated via the work\n\u2206A done on all holes during an oscillation period \u2206t =\n2\u03c0/\u03c9, and is given by18\n\u03bc=\n\n(7)\n\nwhile the same quantity for a hole leaving the column at\nthe other side is given by\nabs\n\u2206En=L\n= \u2212Eb \u2212 VN \u2212 eF a .\n\nThe total time advances by the same amount \u03b4tmin , and\nthe direction of the jump is decided with a probability\n\nIII.\n\n2\u2206A\n.\neF02 \u2206tNh\n\n(11)\n\nRESULTS\n\nWe have simulated the gated system described above\nfor both DC and AC externally applied field.

The mobility decreases again, but exhibits\nanother peak at N =150. For concentrations higher than\n0.5 the average mobility drops extremely rapidly, and\nthe charges are practically immobile. In other words, in\nthe mobility versus N plot, we can observe three maxima (located roughly at N =5, N =100, and N =150) and\nthree minima (for N =30, N =120, and N =180, which\nis the highest concentration we used). One can understand this behavior if one notes that the combination of\nthe intrinsic (work function) barrier, the charging energy\ncoming from other carriers, and the charging energy from\nthe gate within a particular gate geometry, together produce a density dependent pinning barrier which modulates the absorption and injection efficiency. One can see\nthat when absorption/injection efficiency is high, the mobility can be high, and this is caused by the forward drift\nof all carriers. As soon as the density exceeds the critical number Nc the injection is reduced and the incoming\ncarrier has to wait until one has exited . To calculate Nc\nwe note that the Coulomb barrier at entry on column is\ndefined by\n\n(12)\n\nDifferent curves correspond to runs at different temperatures. Figure 2 shows that the temperature dependence\nof the mobility is strongly dependent on the value of N ,\nthe charge density. The increase in mobility with temperature is due to two factors. a) The carriers find it\neasier to come into the chain, and as the temperature\nincreases because of the barrier factor (i.e. as in equation 12) b) the charges can also hop more easily inside\nthe chains against the self-field produced by the other\ncarriers, which means that in equation 12 the factor \u03bc0\nshould be replaced by \u03bc0 (T, N ). The calculated low temperature mobility is very small at T =50 K (not shown).\nIn this limit the charges are practically immobile and cannot overcome the charge-charge interactions which keep\nthem vibrating around their \"equilibrium\" positions.\nAn extremely interesting phenomenon is observed\nwhen we look at the temperature dependence of the calculated mobility at different densities. Figure 2 shows\nthat there are densities at which the \"activation energy\"\nis practically zero. This means that for these particular values of N , a charge distribution is established in\nthe given field geometry, where the injection barrier is\ncompensated by the internal space charge and the gate\nfield. One can also look at it as the variation of the calculated mobility with the number of charges N . When the\ntemperature is constant, the average mobility decreases\nwith increasing N . This is expected because the carriers\nhave less space available to move in. This observation\nis actually true for room temperatures and above, but\nfigure 2 shows that this rule is clearly violated at lower\ntemperatures, and for high concentrations. For low temperatures, the mobility decreases with charge concentration, but when the concentration exceeds a certain value\n\nECB =\n\nN\nX\n\ne2\n\u2212 Egate ,\n4\u03c0\u01eb\u01eb0 nha(N )i\nn=1\n\n(13)\n\nwhere ha(N )i is the average distance between two carriers at total number N . With \u01eb \u223c 3, ECB exceeds kT\nwhen the number of carriers N on the chain is larger\nthan Nc \u223c 40 \u2212 50 (the value increases slightly with the\ntemperature).\nWhen the Coulomb repulsion energy at the entry site\nstarts to get much bigger than kT the carriers block each\nother along the column. They can only move sequentially, \"in a phase\" forced on them by the internal fields.\nThe total energy barrier seen by the carrier on the first\nsite in the column is given by\nEtot = Eb +\n\nX\nj\n\ne2\n\u2212 Egate ,\n4\u03c0\u01eb\u01eb0 rij\n\n(14)\n\nwhere Egate is the \"attractive\" energy of the gate counterions and depends on the distance and gate geometry, and\nthe sum runs over the position of the carriers. When we\nincrease the distance to the gate counter charge distribution from 1 nm to a more realistic value for conventional\ngate devices of d = 30 nm (see figure 3)14,19,20 , the mobility versus density behaves quite differently as shown\nin figure 3. The internal charge density as a function\nof gate voltage is also shown in figure 3. Note that we\nnow have fewer charges for the same gate charge because\nthe coulomb repulsion is relatively stronger and prevents\ncharges from coming into the column. Note also that\nthe mobility versus N oscillations observed in figure 2 no\nlonger appear in the same place.\nFor higher temperatures, the picture is much easier to\nunderstand because the charges have enough energy to\n\n\f5\n\n-5\n\n-6\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-5\n\naverage mobility (m / Vs)\n\n2\n\naverage DC mobility (m / Vs)\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-7\n\n-8\n\n-9\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n200\n\n150\n\nN\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\nTemperature (K)\n\n200\n10\n\n-5\n\n160\n140\n\naverage mobility (m / Vs)\n\n120\n\n2\n\nNumber of holes in the column\n\n180\n\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n200\n\nN (number of charges in the gate)\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\nTemperature (K)\n\nFIG. 3: Comparison between systems with d=1nm (filled\nsymbols) and d=30 nm (open symbols) of a) the average mobility and b) the average number of charges in the column,\nfor T =100 K (circles) and T =300 K (squares), under the influence of a DC field of 20 kV /cm.\n\n-5\n\n2\n\naverage mobility (m / Vs)\n\n10\n\novercome the local attractive energy barriers and there\nis no pinning effect. When T =450 K and N =5, for example, it is much easier for holes to enter the system,\nso that there are always 8 to 9 charges in the column\nwhich undergo a forward drift motion, as opposed to 1\nor 2 charges in the column for T =100 K.\nFor the injection barrier Eb value used, the average\nnumber of holes in the column during the simulation is\nclose to the value expected from the gate charge, except\nof course when we use d=30 nm. Here, the Coulomb repulsion with weak screening keeps the charges out of the\ncolumn (see figure 3). For d=1 nm, the gate to charge\ndensity matching is almost one to one for all temperatures, and at the lower end of concentrations. At higher\nconcentrations, we observe a reduction in the average\nnumber of holes in the column of the order of 10-15%,\ne.g. for N =100 we have around 90 holes. This is not surprising and is an effect of the \"not metallically screened\ncoulomb repulsion\" in the chain19,20 .\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\nTemperature (K)\n\nFIG. 4: Temperature dependence of the average AC mobility\nfor different initial charge concentrations and field frequencies: a) 106 Hz, b) 109 Hz, and c) 1010 Hz. The energy barrier\nheight of the electrode is equal to 0.21 eV. We observe different patterns of behavior as a function of the concentration as\nwe vary the frequency. The gate charges are as follows: N =3\n(\u0003), N =9 (\u22b3), N =18 (\u2022), N =36 (\u2666), and N =60 (\u00d7).\n\n\f6\nB.\n1.\n\nAC Mobility\n\nFinite electrode barrier height\n\nFor the relatively low frequencies of 106 Hz (figure 4a),\nand for intermediate densities, the mobility increases almost one order of magnitude as we increase the temperature (the injection barrier is limiting the mobility).\nBut, at the low concentration end, when carrier interactions are small the temperature dependence is weak. At\nvery low frequencies, one should of course expect similar\nresults to the ones observed in the limit of a DC field.\nSo, the temperature independence at low concentrations\nimplies that at 106 Hz one is already looking at bulk motion. The barrier no longer affects the \"single-particle\"\nmobility. It is important to note that apparently all the\ntemperature dependence in figure 4a is already due to\nmany-body effects. When the frequency of the electric\nfield is increased further, as shown in figure 4b, to the\nfrequency value of 109 Hz for example, the change with\ntemperature is now weaker even for higher densities. On\nthis time scale, the interactions are getting less important\nas one might expect. Indeed, for very high frequencies,\ne.g. 1010 Hz as shown in figure 4c, the mobility actually\ndecreases with increasing temperature, and this behavior\nis monotonic with N . The change in mobility is however\nless than half an order of magnitude. This behavior is\nunusual for hopping systems21 . We believe that this is\nbecause the effective disorder is increasing with temperature. The disorder increases because the number of carriers in the column is increasing and this reduces the free\nvolume, as shown in figure 2.\nFor a given temperature, the calculated frequency dependence is shown in figure 5. Here we have plotted 3\ncurves: a) T =193 K, b) T =343 K, and c) T =493 K. Consider first the low temperature curve. Here the average\nmobility at small concentrations is practically constant\nfor all frequencies. This means that the injection barrier\nhas very little effect on the frequency behavior at this\ntemperature. Let us try to understand why. In the spirit\nof a simple resistance sum22 for a one particle random\nwalker and rigorous in the low frequency limit, we have\nfor a column of 300 sites a transport admittance Y :\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\ne 2 a2\n1\n299\nY (\u03c9) =\n+\n.\n(15)\nkT\ni\u03c9 + Winj\ni\u03c9 + Wbulk\nThe injection rate Winj is activated as in equation 12,\nand the bulk rate Wbulk is a constant for a single particle. From equation 15 one would expect the frequency\ndependence to come in when the frequency is of the order of the injection rate, that is roughly 108 Hz, and to\nsaturate at the bulk value of 1012 . This, however, does\nnot happen in figure 5. At N = 3 the mobility stays\nroughly at saturation value all the way. The reason for\nthis behavior is as shown in figure 2. The particles in\nthe simulation are moving in a potential made up of the\ngate field, the electron-electron interaction and the barrier, i.e. as given by equation 14.

Three different temperatures are presented: a)\nT=193 K, b) T=343 K, and c) T=493 K.

This corresponds to blocking electrodes, which\nmeans that the system is \"closed\" in the sense that no\ncarrier can (subsequent to charging) enter or leave the\ncolumn. In figure 7 we can see that at high frequencies\nthe average mobility is constant and almost the same for\ndifferent concentrations. This is because in this limit we\nare looking at bulk hopping.

The\nenergy barrier height of the electrode is equal to 0.21 eV. Top\nto bottom: N =60, N =36, N = 18, and N = 3. Note the\ncharging effect at higher temperatures and lower concentrations.\n10\n\n2\n\naverage mobility (m / Vs)\n\nconcentration may indeed be much lower than the injection barrier, and that is why there is no, or only a weak\nfrequency dependence for this particular concentration.\nLooking at figure 5 we see that at higher concentrations\nthe mobility becomes strongly frequency dependent (see\nthe corresponding dc limit in figure 2), and rapidly increases with frequency at around 109 Hz. This is now an\ninteraction effect as in equation 14, and it looks as if in\nthe spirit of one body theory, interactions are causing an\neffective disorder. The interactions appear to have little\neffect on time scales shorter than 10\u22129 s. As we raise the\ntemperature further to 343 K, the frequency dependence\nis now weak for all N . Above 343 K, there is in effect no\nstrong inhomogeneity in the hop time distribution. This\nmeans that the variation in hopping activation energies is\ncomparable to kT . Finally, in the extreme high T limit,\nwhen T =493 K the mobility actually decreases with increasing frequency. This is most unusual for hopping\ntransport and is in this model due to the extra charging\nthat high temperature causes, as shown in figure 2. At\nhigh densities, a real time analysis shows that the charges\nmove like a collective \"line of billiard balls\". A carrier\ncan only come in when one has escaped, and the mobility\ndecreases with N at high temperatures. In figure 6, we\npresent the steady state number of holes in the column\nas a function of temperature for different gate charges.\nThis number is an average over all different frequencies\nused. It is evident that there is a considerable net charging effect in the system. The charging is more prominent\nfor smaller N . For example, when N =3 and T =593 K\nthe average number of holes in the system is around 7,\nwhile for T =193 K it is 2 (the absolute value of these\nnumbers depends of course on the value of the interface\nenergy barrier Eb , but the basic trends remain the same).\nThis charging effect is responsible for giving the lower\nvalue of the mobility observed at higher temperatures\n(see for example figure 2). Normally, in hopping transport we expect the mobility to go up with temperature.\nHere however, the steady state density of holes, which\nalso influences the magnitude of the hole-hole scattering,\nis temperature-dependent. There are competing influences: whereas temperature makes hopping easier, the\nnumber of holes also goes up, and this increases therefore the hole-hole interactions, or what is also the degree\nof disorder in the system.\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n-7\n\n-8\n\n-9\n\n-10\n\n10\n\n-11\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n7\n\n10\n\n8\n\n10\n\n9\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n11\n\n10\n\n12\n\nField frequency (Hz)\n\nFIG. 7: Average mobility as a function of frequency for different charge concentrations (top to bottom: N =3, N =18,\nN =36 ) with blocking electrodes and 300 sites at T=293 K.\n\nthe mobility drops steadily to very small values. The\ncarrier displacement is at low frequencies limited by the\nboundary and the decrease in mobility is expected in a\nconfined system. The effect is also concentration dependent. Going up in frequency, we observe that the higher\nthe hole densities, the later the saturation frequency. For\nthe same frequency, the difference in the mobility for the\nlow and high concentrations can be up to 2 orders of\nmagnitude. This is true for concentrations in the range\nfrom 0.01 to 0.12 charges per site.\nThe corresponding temperature/frequency dependence\nis shown in figure 8. The curves seem to lie practically all\non the same points except in the limit of high frequencies.\nHere, the average mobility is temperature dependent and\nthe interesting point is that the mobility decreases with\ntemperature. This is a many-body effect and says that\n\n\f8\n\n2\n\naverage mobility (m / Vs)\n\n10\n\n10\n\ntowards one side of the column. They come very close\nto each other and thus the mobility decreases with N\n(only the one furthest from the edge can move easily, but\nwhen the charge tries to escape, the external field pushes\nit back). As the frequency gets lower and lower, the effect\nbecomes more pronounced because now the biasing field\nremains at the same magnitude and in the same direction\nfor a longer time 1/\u03c9. This is the reason why the mobility\nfalls rapidly and monotonically with lower frequencies. In\nfact, when using blocking electrodes, the DC mobility is\nrigorously 0 as it should be, with the (+) charges 'piling'\nup near the (-) electrode.\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n-7\n\n-8\n\n-9\n\n-10\n\n10\n\n-11\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n7\n\n10\n\n8\n\n10\n\n9\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n11\n\n10\n\n12\n\nField frequency (Hz)\n\nIV.\nFIG. 8: Average mobility as a function of frequency for different temperatures with blocking electrodes and 300 sites,\nwhere N=36. Symbols correspond to the following temperatures: T =193 K (\u2022), T =293 K (\u0003), T =493 K (\u00d7), and T =593\nK (\u25b3).\n\ntemperature is enhancing the coulombic disorder by allowing configurations which provide a wider distribution\nof activation energies.\nIn order to understand this behavior more accurately,\nwe monitored the motion of the charges in the column\nas a function of time. The main conclusion is that the\ncharges follow the periodic pattern imposed by the external alternating field. When the field frequency is high,\nthe charges do not have enough time to come closer to\neach other or to the electrodes, so they fluctuate rapidly\naround their initial positions following the field, and this\ngives rise to the given calculated mobility value shown in\nfigures 7 and 8. As the temperature increases, the thermal energy of the charges allows them to move more easily against the direction of the fields. This increases the\nelectron-electron disorder energy, and in this way temperature now reduces the overall mobility! This picture\nexplains the decrease of the mobility with temperature\nat a given value of (high) frequency, as shown in figure 8.\nFor a given high frequency range, this picture remains\nbasically the same. Suppose that 3 charges are located\nin the column at some equilibrium positions. For a frequency 1012 Hz, for example, they will make very short\nmoves towards one or the other side. When the frequency is switched to 1010 Hz, the charges will again\nfollow the field, but despite the larger distances traveled\nin any one direction, the charge closest to the electrode\nwill still not have enough time to seriously be blocked by\nthe confining electrodes. Similarly, the other charges will\nnot have enough time to feel the changes in each others\npositions, and they will continue to oscillate, essentially\nundisturbed, thus giving rise to the same mobility as for\nhigher frequencies. This explains the constant value of\nthe \u03bc(N ) mobility versus frequency at high frequencies.\nWhen the frequency is small so that the displacement\ncan reach the electrode boundary, the charges are pushed\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have continued the study of charge transport in interacting quasi-one- dimensional gated systems with emphasis on the temperature dependence of the mobility.\nWe have seen that the temperature changes the mobility\nin the presence of a DC field but that the effect is very\nmuch dependent on charge concentration. The temperature dependence is partially due to the assumed injection barrier and partially due to the fact that carriers can\n\"push their way in\" like a line of \"billiard balls\". Both\nfactors work together to produce the final result shown\nin figure 2. Temperature can cause the net steady state\ncharge to vary and this then also affects the charge-charge\ninteraction efficiency (figure 2).\nThe many body interactions do indeed cause a frequency dependence of the mobility. However, using the\nsame parameters as for doped discotic HAT623 , we find\nthat the frequency dependence comes in at too high a\nfrequency. It seems that the experimental data in references 1,2,3,4,23 can only be understood if we also include\ndisorder.\nWhen we have blocking electrodes, the interactions influence the density and the temperature dependent ac\nmobility. The charges increase the confinement and the\nmobility decreases with concentration and with temperature in the way one would expect for finite ordered\nsegments. Finally, we now need to extend our theoretical tools to handle 2-dimensional systems, so that\nwe can model smectic liquid crystals, mixes of smectics,\nFET's, thin-film transistors (TFT), and also the transport through large molecules such as nanotubes and nanotubes filled with fullerenes (pea pods)24 . So far the work\nhas focused on quantum transport. There are and will\nbe, we believe, many new and exciting experimental results coming up in this field in the stochastic and diffusion\nlimit.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nOne of the authors, B.
