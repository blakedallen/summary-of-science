We investigate\na01 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 and a01 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 decay channels. No significant signal is found. We obtain upper\nlimits on the product of B(\u03a5(1S) \u2192 \u03b3a01 ) and B(a01 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 ) or B(a01 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ). Our \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 results\nare almost two orders of magnitude more stringent than previous upper limits. Our data provide\nno evidence for a Higgs state with a mass of 214 MeV decaying to \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 . Existence of such a\nstate was previously proposed as an explanation for 3 \u03a3+ \u2192 p\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 events, having \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 masses\njust above the kinematic threshold, observed by the HyperCP experiment. Our results constrain\nNMSSM models.\n\n2\n\n\fDirect searches at LEP for the Standard Model Higgs boson, a CP-even scalar, set a\nlower bound on its mass in excess of 102 GeV [1]. Many extensions of the Standard Model\npredict the existence of a CP-odd pseudoscalar Higgs boson (hereafter denoted as a01 ), which\ncould be light. For example, the Next-to-Minimal Super-Symmetric Model (NMSSM) with\na01 mass below the threshold for a01 \u2192 bb\u0304 decay is particularly well motivated [2]. Radiative\nproduction in \u03a5(1S) decays, \u03a5(1S) \u2192 \u03b3a01 , offers a unique experimental opportunity to\nsearch for such a state. The couplings of the Higgs to fermions are proportional to their\nmasses, therefore enhanced with respect to lighter mesons. The expected rate is given by\n[3]:\n\uf8f1\n! \uf8fc\nma01 2 \uf8fd\nB(\u03a5(1S) \u2192 \u03b3a01 )\nGF mb 2 2 \uf8f2\n= \u221a\nC,\n1\u2212\ngd\n\uf8f3\nB(\u03a5(1S) \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 )\nm\u03a5(1S) \uf8fe\n2\u03c0\u03b1\n\nwhere GF is the Fermi constant, \u03b1 is the fine structure constant, gd is the a01 coupling to\nthe down-type fermions, and C incorporates QCD and relativistic corrections. The coupling\ngd \u221d tan \u03b2 cos \u03b8A , where tan \u03b2 is the ratio of vacuum expectations for the two Higgs doublets,\nand \u03b8A is the mixing angle between doublet and singlet CP-odd Higgs bosons (for \u03b8A = 900 ,\na01 is a pure singlet and decouples from fermions); gd depends on the detailed choice of SUSY\nparameters. For ma01 < 2mb , the decay a01 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 is expected to dominate, especially at\nlarge tan \u03b2, B(a01 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 ) \u223c 0.9 [2]. For ma01 < 2m\u03c4 , a01 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 decays are copious below\nthe ss\u0304 threshold. In fact, it has been suggested that 3 \u03a3+ \u2192 p\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 events observed by the\nHyperCP experiment [4] are due to a CP-odd Higgs with a mass of 214.3 \u00b1 0.5 MeV [5].\nThe data for this search were acquired with the CLEO-III detector [6] operating at the\nCornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 1.1\nfb\u22121 at the \u03a5(1S), yielding (21.5 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 106 resonant decays. We also use 7 fb\u22121 of data\ncollected at and near the \u03a5(4S) resonance for continuum background studies.\nThe CLEO-III detector has a solid angle coverage of 93% of 4\u03c0 for charged and neutral\nparticles. The CsI calorimeter attains \u03b3 energy resolutions of about 2% for E\u03b3 \u2265 1 GeV\nand 5% at 100 MeV. The charged particle tracking system operated in a 1.5 T magnetic\nfield along the beam axis and achieved a momentum (p) resolution of 0.35% at 1 GeV and\na dE/dx resolution of 6%. The muon detector consists of the wire chambers located at 3,\n5, and 7 hadronic interaction lengths (at normal incidence) of iron absorber.\nWe select events with exactly two tracks of opposite charge and at least one \u03b3. The highest\nenergy \u03b3, which when paired with any other \u03b3 in the event, is not within three standard\ndeviations (3\u03c3) of the \u03c0 0 mass, is selected to be a candidate for \u03a5(1S) \u2192 \u03b3a01 . Photons\nare defined as showers that do not match charged track projections into the calorimeter.\nFor optimal energy resolution and smallest backgrounds the radiative-decay \u03b3 is required to\nbe in the barrel part of the calorimeter (| cos \u03b8| < 0.8). Its lateral shower profile must be\nconsistent with an isolated electromagnetic shower. When applying the \u03c0 0 veto, we place\nloose requirements on the other (non-signal) photon. Namely, the other \u03b3 is not required to\nbe isolated and the entire solid angle of the calorimeter is used for its detection. Its energy\nis required to be at least 30 MeV (60 MeV) in the barrel (endcap) part of the calorimeter.\nThe \u03c0 0 veto suppresses e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 , with at least one \u03c4 decaying to a channel with \u03c0 0\n(mostly \u03c1\u03bd).\nTo select a01 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 candidates we require a missing energy between 2 and 7 GeV. The\ntotal energy calculation is based on charged track momenta (the pion mass is assumed) and\ncalorimeter energy for the looser definition of the \u03b3 candidates (see above). To suppress\nhadronic events from the continuum production and \u03a5(1S) decays, at least one of the\n3\n\n\fcharged tracks must be identified as an electron or a muon. Events with two electrons are\ndiscarded to suppress Bhabha like events. Besides being identified in the muon system, the\n\u03bc candidate is required to have an energy deposited in the calorimeter (E) consistent with\na minimum ionizing particle. The electron candidate must have E equal p within \u00b115%.\ndE/dx consistency is required for for leptons. The invariant mass of photons (except for\nthe radiative-decay \u03b3) plus the charged track not identified as a lepton is required to be less\nthan 2 GeV. To suppress final state radiation, the cosine of the angle between any charged\ntrack and the \u03b3 candidate must be less than 0.99.\nWe search for evidence for a signal of a monochromatic peak in the \u03b3 energy distribution. Thus, our results assume that the a01 natural width is negligible compared with the\nexperimental resolution, an assumption which is expected to be true, with the exception\nof the heaviest masses probed in the \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 channel, due to possible mixing with the \u03b7b [7].\nCLEO previously published an alternative method for probing the a01 mass approaching the\nbb\u0304 states, which is not sensitive to assumptions about its width [8].\nThe selected event sample is composed mostly of continuum e+ e\u2212 \u2192 (\u03b3)\u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 events,\nwhere the \u03b3 candidate comes either from initial state radiation (ISR) or from a \u03c0 0 produced\nin \u03c4 decay, with the second \u03b3 not reconstructed. The background estimates are superimposed on top of the spectrum obtained at the \u03a5(1S) resonance in Fig. 1a. The continuum\nbackgrounds are estimated by scaling the \u03a5(4S) distributions. There is also a significant\ncontribution from \u03a5(1S) \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 with the \u03b3 candidate coming from a \u03c0 0 decay. The observed \u03b3 spectrum with binning comparable to our \u03b3 energy resolution is shown in Fig. 1c.\nNo significant peaks are observed.\nThe channel a01 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 is selected by identifying both muons. We require that the total\nobserved energy be within 250 MeV of the center-of-mass energy. The invariant dimuon\nmass has better resolution than the \u03b3 energy, therefore we use it to look for the a01 signal.\nThe selected data are dominated by radiative \u03bc-pairs with a hard radiative photon. The\ndata selected at the peak of the \u03a5(1S) resonance are well described by scaling the data\ncollected at and near the \u03a5(4S) as illustrated in Fig. 1b. The \u03a5(1S) distribution plotted\nwith binning comparable to our dimuon mass resolution is shown in Fig. 1d. No significant\npeak is found except for the J/\u03c8 produced by ISR.\nThe signal efficiency varies with Higgs mass, or equivalently, \u03b3 energy. In order to determine the efficiency, we generated signal Monte Carlo (MC) for several a01 masses and\ninterpolated for masses in between. Proper angular correlations were implemented in the\nMC for both the polar angle of the radiative \u03b3 and for \u03c4 polarizations [9]. The signal peaks\nobserved in the dimuon mass (\u03b3 energy) distribution for a01 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 (a01 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 ) were\nfitted to a Gaussian (with an asymmetric low energy tail, i.e., a Crystal Ball line shape [10])\nto determine reconstruction efficiency and detector resolution, which are shown in Fig. 2ac\n(bd). The fit to the J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ISR peak observed in the \u03a5(1S) data gives a value for\nthe resolution consistent with the MC expectations for an a01 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 signal at that mass\n(Fig. 2d).\nWe have scanned the observed \u03b3 energy and dimuon mass distributions by fitting a signal\npeak on top of a cubic background polynomial, changing the peak position in steps equal to\nthe detector resolution. The peak width was fixed to the MC expectations. The fit range\nwas set to \u00b10.5 of ln(E\u03b3 ) (\u00b10.25 of ln(M\u03bc\u03bc )) around the peak position. The J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212\npeak region was excluded within \u00b13\u03c3, unless fitting a peak at the J/\u03c8 mass. Since, in\nthe dimuon channel, the continuum backgrounds saturate the \u03a5(1S) sample (see Fig. 1b),\nwe simultaneously fit the background polynomial to the dimuon mass distribution obtained\n4\n\n\ffrom the higher statistics \u03a5(4S) data. The overall background normalization factor for the\n\u03a5(4S) data was included as a free parameter in the fit.\nTo test for possible bias in the fit procedure, we calculated average and root mean square\n(RMS) values of fitted signal amplitude (N) divided by its error (\u2206N). In absence of any\nsignal peaks, values of 0.0 and 1.0 are expected, respectively. The average value for the data\nis +0.01 \u00b1 0.09 (\u22120.06 \u00b1 0.05) for the \u03b3\u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 (\u03b3\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) sample, while the RMS is 1.16 \u00b1 0.09\n(1.05 \u00b1 0.05). To cover the observed deviations from the expectations we assume 15% for a\npossible systematic error in the fit procedure.\nThe ratio of the fit likelihoods for a signal peak included in the fit (Lmax ) and the data fit\nwith the background\nterm alone (L0 ) is used to calculate the peak significance in standard\nq\ndeviations, 2 ln(Lmax /L0 ). No peak with significance above 3\u03c3 is found in the \u03b3\u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 data.\nIn the \u03b3\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 data, the ISR J/\u03c8 peak has 8.3\u03c3 significance. There are two other mass points\nwhich produce peaks with significance slightly above 3\u03c3: 3.3\u03c3 at 2041 \u00b1 4 MeV and 3.1\u03c3 at\n211.92 \u00b1 0.15 MeV. For one trial, the probability (\u01eb) of background fluctuations producing\na peak with significance equal or larger to 3.3\u03c3 (3.1\u03c3) is 0.05% (0.1%). We performed 482\nfits to \u03b3\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 spectrum with the peak positions separated by one unit of mass resolution.\nAssuming that peaks must be separated by at least 3 units of mass resolution to fluctuate\nindependently, we performed about n = 482/3 \u2248 160 statistically independent trials. The\noverall probability in our scan of producing at least one peak with significance of at least\n3.3\u03c3 (3.1\u03c3) is 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u01eb)n \u2248 8% (15%).\nWith no evidence for an a01 signal we set upper limits on its possible production rate\nas a function of the a01 mass. To determine upper limits on the signal event yield we\nfix the signal amplitude to positive values and minimize it with respect to the background\nparameters to obtain a likelihood for given signal amplitude. We then integrate the likelihood\nfunction and find a signal amplitude which bounds 90% of the total area. Dividing this event\nlimit by efficiency and the number of \u03a5(1S) decays in our data we obtain upper limits on\nB(\u03a5(1S) \u2192 \u03b3a01 ) \u00d7 B(a01 \u2192 l+ l\u2212 ) (l = \u03c4 or \u03bc), which are displayed in Fig. 3. The limits\nwere scaled up by 20% to account for the possible systematic error in the fit procedure\n(15%), in the efficiency calculation (MC statistics, interpolation between MC points, detector\nmodeling; together < 10%), in number of \u03a5(1S) decays (2%), and in simulation of detector\nresolution (10%). Our upper limits on B(\u03a5(1S) \u2192 \u03b3a01 ) \u00d7B(a01 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 ) are almost 2 orders\nof magnitude more stringent than previously obtained by ARGUS [11]. Our upper limits on\nB(\u03a5(1S) \u2192 \u03b3a01 ) \u00d7 B(a01 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) are the first experimental bounds.\nOur \u03b3\u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 results provide stringent constraints on NMSSM models, eliminating a large\nportion of previously unconstrained parameter space. This is illustrated in Fig. 4, where\nNMSSM calculations by Dermisek, Gunion, McElrath [2] are compared to our upper limits.\nWhile some model parameters were fixed (e.g. tan \u03b2 = 10) in the theoretical calculations,\nother parameters were sampled. Each point represents a different choice of NMSSM parameter values consistent with the current experimental constraints. The plot on the right represents models with the additional requirement of low fine-tuning of electroweak symmetry\nbreaking (see Ref.[2] for details). Color coding corresponds to various a01 mass ranges. Our\nupper limits in various a01 mass ranges are shown by horizontal lines. Solid (dashed) line(s)\nrepresent an average (minimal and maximal) upper limits in given mass range. Assuming\nthat B(a01 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 ) is 100%, the models above these lines are excluded. Our upper limits\nin the \u03b3\u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 channel for lower a01 masses, 2m\u03c4 < ma01 < 7.5 GeV (red lines at the center of\neach plot), eliminate a significant fraction of models in this mass range (red points). Only\nvery few models are challenged in the 7.5 < ma01 < 8.8 GeV range (green points and lines at\n5\n\n\fthe sides of scatter plots). For higher masses (black points and lines touching the plot axes)\nour discriminating power fades away as the backgrounds increase while the expected signal\nrate decreases due to the phase space suppression. The non-singlet fraction of a01 (cos \u03b8A )\nincreases with falling tan \u03b2 [2], though the net effect on gd , and therefore B(\u03a5(1S) \u2192 \u03b3a01 ),\nis to decrease. At the same time, a01 coupling to up-type fermions, gu \u221d cos \u03b8A / tan \u03b2, increases, lowering B(a01 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 ). Thus, models with small tan \u03b2 values are less constrained\nby our data.\nSince B(a01 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) is not expected to be large above the a01 \u2192 ss\u0304 threshold (\u223c 1\nGeV), we did not transfer our limits on B(\u03a5(1S) \u2192 \u03b3a01 )B(a01 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) to Fig. 4, where\nNSSM model calculations of B(\u03a5(1S) \u2192 \u03b3a01 ) below the \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 threshold (blue points) were\nperformed only for ma01 > 1 GeV. Our limits below this mass value constrain NSSM scenarions. Of particular interest is our upper limit for ma01 = 214.3 MeV, i.e., the \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 mass of 3\n\u03a3+ \u2192 p\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 events observed by the HyperCP experiment [4]. The fit to our data (see Fig. 5)\n0\n\u22126\ngives 7.0+5.3\n\u22124.5 events at this mass and leads to an upper limit of B(\u03a5(1S) \u2192 \u03b3a1 ) < 2.3 \u00d710\nat 90% C.L. He, Tandean and Valencia showed that they could explain the HyperCP events\nwith the a01 hypothesis and still be consistent with the constraints from K \u2192 \u03c0\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 experiments [5]. In their calculations they used gd2 = 0.12, while our upper limit translates\ninto gd2 < 0.026 (using C = 0.5 [3]), which calls for reevaluation of the a01 hypothesis for the\nHyperCP events.\nIn summary, we have obtained meaningful upper limits on B(\u03a5(1S) \u2192 \u03b3a01 ) \u00d7 B(a01 \u2192\n+ \u2212\n\u03c4 \u03c4 ) and B(\u03a5(1S) \u2192 \u03b3a01 ) \u00d7 B(a01 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ). Our limits on \u03b3\u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 are almost two orders\nof magnitude more stringent than those from ARGUS and eliminate a large portion of previously unconstrained parameter space in NMSSM models. Our limits on \u03b3\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 challenge\nmodels with a01 mass below ss\u0304 threshold and the a01 interpretation of HyperCP \u03a3+ \u2192 p\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212\nevents. Our limits are applicable to any light scalar or pseduo-scalar boson, which arises in\nvarious extensions of Standard Model.\nWe gratefully acknowledge the effort of the CESR staff in providing us with excellent\nluminosity and running conditions.
