The \u03b2-like conformers increase with pathological mutations and\nunder other conditions known to promote aggregation.\n\n2\n\n\fABSTRACT\nHuman \u03b1-Synuclein (\u03b1Syn) is a natively unfolded protein whose aggregation into amyloid\nfibrils is involved in Parkinson disease. A full comprehension of the structure and dynamics\nof early intermediates leading to the aggregated states is an unsolved problem of essential\nimportance in deciphering the molecular mechanisms of \u03b1Syn aggregation and formation of\nfibrils.\n\nTraditional bulk techniques utilized so far to solve this problem point to a direct\ncorrelation between the \u03b1Syn unique conformational properties and its propensity to\naggregate but can only provide ensemble-averaged information for monomers and oligomers\nalike. They therefore cannot characterize the full complexity of the conformational equilibria\nthat trigger the aggregation process.\nWe applied Atomic Force Microscopy-based single-molecule mechanical unfolding\nmethodology to study the conformational equilibrium of human wild-type and mutant \u03b1Syn.\nThe conformational heterogeneity of monomeric \u03b1Syn was characterized at the single\nmolecule level. Three main classes of conformations, including disordered and \"\u03b2-like\"\nstructures, were directly observed and quantified without any interference from oligomeric\nsoluble forms. The relative abundance of the \"\u03b2-like\" structures significantly increased in\ndifferent conditions promoting the aggregation of \u03b1Syn: the presence of Cu2+, the pathogenic\nA30P mutation, and high ionic strength.\nThis methodology can explore the full conformational space of a protein at the single\nmolecule level, detecting even poorly-populated conformers and measuring their distribution\nin a variety of biologically significant conditions. To the best of our knowledge, we present\nfor the first time evidence of a conformational equilibrium that controls the population of a\nspecific class of monomeric \u03b1Syn conformers, positively correlated with conditions known to\npromote the formation of aggregates. A new tool is thus made available to directly test the\ninfluence of mutations and pharmacological strategies on the conformational equilibrium of\nmonomeric \u03b1Syn.\n\n3\n\n\fINTRODUCTION\nA significant fraction (possibly as much as 30%) of proteins and segments of proteins in\neukaryotic proteomes has been found to lack, at least partially, a well-defined threedimensional structure. Proteins belonging to this class are usually called natively unfolded\nproteins (NUPs) [1]. NUPs have been found to play key roles in a wide range of biological\nprocesses like transcriptional and translational regulation, signal transduction, protein\nphosphorylation and the folding of RNA and other proteins [2]. The conformational\nheterogeneity of NUPs allows them to adopt conformations that trigger pathogenic\naggregation processes. In fact, NUPs are involved in the pathogenesis of some of the most\nwidespread and socially relevant neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer and\nParkinson [3-5]. Despite intensive research, the folding and the aggregation mechanisms of\nNUPs remain a major unsolved problem.\nTheoretical studies depict the apparent structural disorder of NUPs as the result of the\ncoexistence of a complex ensemble of conformers ensuing from a rugged energy landscape\n[6]. Five clusters of conformations, each with its own characteristic tertiary structure, were\nidentified by Molecular Dynamics studies on the Alzheimer's \u03b2 peptide [7]. Traditional bulk\nexperiments and spectroscopies have recently been providing experimental evidence of the\nconformational diversity of these proteins [3,5]. Because of their inherent ensemble\naveraging, however, these methodologies cannot reveal the full complexity of the\nconformational equilibria of NUPs. Single molecule methodologies can single out the\nstructures adopted by individual molecules within a complex conformational equilibrium [811,12 ,13,14].\nWe decided to approach the problem of the characterization of the conformers of \u03b1-synuclein\n(\u03b1Syn) (UniProtKB accession number P37840 , SYUA_HUMAN), a prototype of this class\nof proteins. \u03b1Syn is a 140 aa protein expressed primarily at the presynaptic terminals in the\ncentral nervous system, and it is thought to be physiologically involved in endoplasmic\nreticulum - Golgi vesicle trafficking [15]. \u03b1Syn is involved in the pathogenesis of several\nneurodegenerative diseases, called synucleopathies. Intracellular proteinaceous aggregates\n(Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites) of \u03b1Syn are hallmarks of Parkinson disease [16] and\n4\n\n\fmultiple system atrophy [17]. Three naturally occurring mutations in the \u03b1Syn protein\nsequence, A30P, A53T, and E46K have been identified so far in human families affected by\nfamilial Parkinsonism [18-20]. These mutant proteins display an increased tendency to form\nnon-fibrillar aggregates [21] and Lewy-bodies-like fibrils in vitro [22].\n\nThe fibrils spontaneously formed by \u03b1Syn by a nucleation-dependent mechanism are rich in\n\u03b2 structure[23,24]. The transition from the natively unfolded monomeric state to fibril is\ntherefore a process of acquiring structure. This process is still under strong debate. Evidence\nis accumulating that the monomeric \u03b1Syn, under in vitro physiological conditions, populates\nan ensemble of conformations including extended conformers and structures more compact\nthan expected for a completely unfolded chain [25-32]. The marked differences between the\nscenarios depicted in those studies are mostly determined by the different time scales of the\nensemble-averaging of the different methods utilized. Moreover, it is difficult for bulk\nmethodologies to single out the monomeric state in the presence of soluble oligomers when\nthey form quickly in solution [33]. On the contrary, the Single Molecule Force Spectroscopy\n(SMFS) approach reported here describes, by design, the conformational equilibrium of the\nmonomeric form.\nThe different structures assumed by \u03b1Syn have been commonly investigated by adding to its\nbuffer solution different chemicals, such as methanol or trifluoroethanol [34], metal cations\nlike Cu2+ and Al3+ [35,36], or SDS micelles [37-39] in order to shift the conformational\nequilibrium towards the form under investigation. A previous force spectroscopy experiment\nshowed that a relevant 12-amino acid segment of \u03b1Syn is conformationally heterogeneous\n[40]. The approach we report can span the full conformational space of the whole protein\nand also identify poorly populated conformers of the monomeric \u03b1Syn in in vitro\nphysiological conditions. Three distinct classes of structures in equilibrium were identified:\nrandom coil, a mechanically weak fold, and \"\u03b2-like\". Their populations were also monitored\nunder conditions known to influence aggregation, such as the presence of Cu 2+, high buffer\nconcentration and, most importantly, the pathogenic mutation A30P.\nRESULTS\nIn order to stretch an individual \u03b1Syn molecule by AFM we need handles to connect one end\n5\n\n\fof the protein to the tip and the other to the substrate. To this end, we followed the design\nproposed by J. Fernandez for the study of the random coiled titin N2B segment [41]. A\nchimeric polyprotein composed of a single \u03b1Syn module flanked on either side by three\ntandem I27 domains (PDB entry: 1tit) (3S3, Fig. 1A) was expressed [42-44]. These domains\nact as molecular handles to mechanically stretch a single \u03b1Syn molecule. They also introduce\nwell-characterized fingerprint signals into the recorded force curves that make it possible to\nidentify the different \u03b1Syn conformations. The design is such that if the number of unfolding\nsignals coming from I27 modules is larger than four, we are sure to have also mechanically\nstretched the \u03b1Syn module in the middle (see Fig. 1A). Among the curves showing\nmechanical unfolding events, however, only those featuring at least six unfolding peaks were\nselected and analyzed. This choice reduced the statistical sample even more, but it allowed us\nto recognize, in a very stringent way, the signatures of the different conformations of the \u03b1\nSyn moiety on each construct molecule that had been stretched.\nTo probe the native-like conformer population of \u03b1Syn, we performed experiments in a 10\nmM Tris buffer solution. We found that the profiles of the selected force curves can be\nclassified into three main classes. Two were unambiguously assigned to well-defined classes\nof conformers: one with the typical mechanical behavior of random-coil chains and the other\nof \u03b2-like structures. We propose that the profiles of the third class correspond to fairly\ncompact architectures, likely to be sustained also by interactions among different modules of\nthe construct.\n\nThe signature of disordered conformers of \u03b1Syn with the mechanical behavior of an\nentropic random coil\nIn the class of traces depicted in Fig. 1B, the force curve exhibits (from left to right) a long\ninitial region, without any significant deviation from the Worm-Like Chain (WLC) behavior\n[45], followed by a saw-tooth pattern with six consecutive unfolding events, in addition to the\nlast one that corresponds to the final detachment of the molecule from the tip. The initial\nregion corresponds to the extension of a chain that occurs at low force and without significant\nenergy barriers limiting its extensibility.\n\n6\n\n\fFigure 1. The mechanical signatures of \u03b1Syn conformational classes as recorded by SMFS. (A) Schematic representation of the\npolyprotein constructs used in this work: 3S3 contains the \u03b1Syn sequence (red) flanked on either side by three titin I27 modules (blue), the\nN-terminal His-tag, needed for purification purposes, (green) and the C-terminal Cys-Cys tail needed for covalent attachment to the gold\nsurface (yellow); in 1S1, the \u03b1Syn moiety is flanked only by one I27 on both sides; the 3T is made up by three I27s. In the \u03b1Syn moiety\n(enlarged), three regions are shown: i) the amphipathic region, prone to fold in \u03b1-helical structures when in contact with phospholipid\nmembranes; ii) the fibrillogenic NAC region, characteristic of the fibril core of \u03b1Syn amyloid; and iii) the acidic C-terminal tail, strongly\n2+\ncharged and not prone to fold. The positions of alanine 30, site of the A30P mutation and histidine 50, crucial for the binding of Cu , are\nmarked. (B) Example of curve characterized by a featureless region assigned to the stretching of \u03b1Syn moiety having, in this case, the\nmechanical properties of a random coil (see text). This region is followed (from left to right) by six unfolding peaks of about 200 pN, with\nabout 28 nm gaps between each other, assigned to the unfolding of I27 domains. (C) Example of the curves featuring the \"\u03b2-like\" signature\nof \u03b1Syn (see text), showing seven practically indistinguishable unfolding events of similar magnitude and spacing. (D) Curves featuring the\nsignature of mechanically weak interactions, showing single or multiple small peaks (arrows) superimposed on the purely entropic WLC\nbehavior of the trace preceding the six saw-tooth-like peaks. Right panels show a zoom of the region enclosed by the dashed squares.\n\n7\n\n\fThe six unfolding peaks are spaced by ~28 nm. This spacing between the peaks corresponds\nto an 89 amino acid chain (0.36 nm per amino acid [46]), i.e., to the increase in length of the\nprotein after the unfolding of one I27 domain. These six unfolding peaks correspond to the\ncharacteristic fingerprint of the mechanical unfolding of the I27 modules [41]. We can\ntherefore infer that, in this case, the AFM tip picked up the 3S3 construct molecules at the\nHis-tag terminus, while the other end was tethered to the gold surface by the C-terminal\ncysteines.\nThe location of the first unfolding peak of I27, corresponding to the contour length of the\nconstruct molecules prior to any unfolding event, proves that the preceding featureless part of\nthe trace can be unambiguously assigned to the \u03b1Syn chain. In fact, the measured contour\nlength that fits this peak is 77 \u00b1 4 nm. Subtracting the length of the six, still folded, I27\ndomains from this value (4.5 nm each [47]), a value of 48 \u00b1 4 nm is obtained. This length\ncorresponds to the chain of 140 aa of the \u03b1Syn. Therefore, this featureless initial part is the\nsignature of \u03b1Syn conformers with the mechanical properties of a random coil. Their average\npersistence length was estimated by fitting the WLC model at 0.36 \u00b1 0.05 nm. About 38% of\nthe molecules showed this mechanical behavior in Tris/HCl buffer 10 mM (Fig. 2).\n\nFigure 2. Population shift of \u03b1Syn conformers in different conditions.

Percentages observed for each curve type (see Fig. 1) at 10 mM Tris/HCl (n = 55), 10 mM Tris/HCl with 1 \u03bcM\n2+\nCu (n = 34), the A30P mutant in 10 mM Tris/HCl (n = 56) and 500 mM Tris/HCl (n = 61).\n\n8\n\n\fThe signature of \u03b1Syn conformers with the mechanical behavior of a chain containing a\n\u03b2-like structured segment\nA significant proportion of force curves with seven regularly spaced unfolding peaks in the\n200 pN range (in addition to the last one corresponding to the final detachment) (Fig. 1C)\nwas also recorded.\nThe presence of a number of unfolding events greater than that of the I27 modules in the\nconstruct cannot be ascribed to a possible simultaneous pulling of more than one 3S3\nmolecule because pulling two multi-domain constructs at the same time would not likely lead\nto a uniform separation between the I27 unfolding events. Moreover, we never obtained a\nsignificant and uniform set of reproducible curves with eight or more unfolding peaks with 28\nnm separation.. Curves with seven unfolding events were well reproducible and their\nstatistics was unambiguously modulated by conditions able to trigger aggregation, for\nexample, ionic strength, the presence of\n\nCu2+ ions and, most importantly, pathogenic\n\nmutations (see below). The appearance of seven unfolding events cannot come from a\nconstruct accidentally expressed with seven, instead of six, I27 domains because of the\ncloning strategy (see Materials and Methods section). The occurrence of a seventh peak due\nto the stretching of 3S3 dimers can be also ruled out. Dimers could form in solution via\ndisulfide bonds between the terminal cysteines, but those bonds tend to dissociate into thiols\nin the presence of gold, because the gold-sulfur bond is more stable than the sulfur-sulfur\nbond [48]. Each monomer contains two terminal cysteines and one of them could be involved\nin the dimerization and the other could bind to the gold surface. Even in this unlikely event,\nthe length of the tethered chains extending from the surface is the same as that of a nondimerized construct. Therefore, also in the case of a dimer tethered to the surface, more than\nsix I27 unfolding peaks with the same separation cannot be recorded. We nevertheless tested\nthe sample using DTT to avoid any disulfide-bonded dimer formation. Under these\nconditions, the statistics of different populations was comparable to those in the standard\nbuffer, and we still recorded a significant proportion (~10%) of 7-peaked curves.\n\nBecause of the previous considerations, we therefore assign one of the seven peaks to the\nunfolding of the \u03b1Syn moiety. The length (95 aa) of this \u03b1Syn \"\u03b2-like\" folded section\naccidentally coincides with that of the I27 domain. This coincidence hinders the possibility to\ndiscriminate the peak of the \u03b1Syn from the six of the I27 domains. Nevertheless, the\n\n9\n\n\fassignment of these curves to the unfolding of the \u03b1Syn moiety is confirmed by the position\nof the first unfolding peak, i.e., by the contour length of the construct molecules prior to any\nunfolding event. As shown in Fig. 3, the position values correspond to a chain composed of\nthe six I27 folded modules, plus the \u03b1Syn moiety with its C-terminal segment of 50 aa fully\nunfolded, and the remaining 95 amino acids folded into a structure with the same contour\nlength as a folded I27 domain (solid line). The low propensity to fold of the 50 aa of the very\nacidic \u03b1Syn C-terminal tail has been extensively documented [38,39,49]. Segments of the\nremaining 95 amino acids are instead known to fold under different conditions into an \u03b1-helix\n[38,39] or, in the amyloid, into a \u03b2-sheet structure [31]. It must be noted that in about 40% of\nthe molecules, the contour length of the same folded section is larger than that corresponding\nto 95 aa. The \u03b1Syn structural diversity therefore includes also \"\u03b2-like\" chain portions with\ndifferent lengths. This interpretation is confirmed by comparing the variance of the folded\nsection of 7-peaked curves with that of I27 modules (Fig. 3).\n\nFigure 3. Contour length analysis of \"\u03b2-like\" force curves. Values of the first peak position in force curves showing seven unfolding\npeaks. The height of each bar corresponds to the initial contour length of a single curve, obtained by fitting the first unfolding peak by\nmeans of the WLC model. The dashed line is the length corresponding to a protein construct with six I27 folded modules plus 95 aa of \u03b1Syn\nfolded into a \u03b2-like structure, and the remaining 50 aa of \u03b1Syn unstructured (see text). The dashed-and-dotted line is the length\ncorresponding to a protein construct with six I27 modules plus the 140 aa of \u03b1Syn completely unstructured. The lengths of twelve randomly\nchosen I27 modules have also been reported (dark gray columns) for comparison. The solid line is the nominal I27 contour length. The\nlarger spreading of the \u03b1Syn data confirms the higher conformational heterogeneity. Side quotas show the difference between the maximum\nand minum observed length value for I27 (bottom) and \"\u03b2-like\" structures (top).\n\nThe 200 pN unfolding force of all the seven peaks indicates that the folded section of \u03b1Syn\n\n10\n\n\fhas the same mechanical properties of the I27 \u03b2-sandwich structure. At the moment, without\nany independent structural characterization, we consider and label this folded structure of the\n\u03b1Syn moiety just as \"\u03b2-like\", in accordance with its mechanical behavior. Nevertheless, its\nmechanical behavior is in agreement with a \u03b2-sheet content in the \"\u03b2-like\" class of\nconformers. It is unlikely that the \u03b1-helical content we observed by means of CD (see below)\ncorrelates with the \"\u03b2-like\" conformers. In fact, whereas \u03b2-structures, like those of titin\nmodules, such as I27 [41,50], or tenascin [51], unfold at forces in the range of 100-300 pN (at\nloading rates of the order of 10-5 N/s), the \u03b1-helix domains, in the same conditions, are\nalways observed to unfold at forces almost one order of magnitude smaller [52-55].\nIn conclusion, these curve profiles provide clear evidence that in 10 mM Tris/HCl buffer,\nabout 7% of the molecules (Fig. 2) contain a segment of the \u03b1Syn chain of about 95 aa folded\ninto a structure with the mechanical property of the I27 \u03b2-sandwich structure. This percentage\nof the \"\u03b2-like\" structures, as we will see below, can be related with conditions leading to\npathogenic aggregation.\nSignatures of further conformational complexity probed as mechanically weak\ninteractions\nThe remaining force spectroscopy curves (Fig. 1D) show single or multiple small peaks\n(sometimes with a plateau- or dome-like appearance) superimposed on the purely entropic\nWLC behavior of the trace preceding the six saw-tooth-like peaks.\nThe geometry of our construct made it possible to exclude that those small peaks might\ncorrespond to the rupture of aspecific \u03b1Syn-gold interactions. In fact, if the unstructured \u03b1\nSyn was adsorbed on the surface, upon pulling the construct, we would have recorded the\nfirst event at a distance from the tip contact point corresponding to the length of the three I27\nmodules (ca. 13.5 nm). The mechanically weak events we observed instead took place at an\naverage distance from the contact point of 60 \u00b1 26 nm with no events below 20 nm. They are\ntherefore not compatible with \u03b1Syn-gold interactions. We assign these signals to the rupture\nof mechanically weak interactions placed at short- and long-distances along the chain.\nThe average forces of those single or multiple small peaks of the profiles are in the 64 \u00b1\n30 pN range (well above the noise level), without a defined hierarchy; often stronger peaks\nprecede weaker ones, hinting topologically \"nested\" interactions. From the difference\nbetween the contour length estimated at those small peaks and that at the first I27 unfolding\n11\n\n\fpeak, one can measure the size of the topological loop enclosed by the interactions whose\nrupture is monitored by the different peaks. The resulting broad distribution of these distances\nmonitors the ample multiplicity of these interactions as discussed in the Supplementary\nMaterial.\nMore than 50% of the molecules showed short- and long-distance mechanically weak\ninteractions in 10 mM Tris/HCl buffer (Fig. 2). These interactions were also monitored by\nensemble-averaged fluorescence spectroscopy. The fluorescence comes from the tryptophan\nresidues of the I27 domains which are absent in \u03b1Syn. The fluorescence spectra reported in\nFig. 4A prove that interactions between the I27 handles and tracts of the \u03b1Syn moiety do take\nplace, as shown by the broadening of the spectrum of 1S1 with respect to that of the 3T\nconstruct (See Fig. 1A and Materials and Methods section for constructs description.) and by\nthe 5 nm shift of the \u03bbmax. The possibility of partial I27 unfolding leading to Trp exposure\nand broadening of the spectrum is ruled out by the CD data and by our force curves, which\nshow that I27 domains are as tightly folded in the 3S3 construct as in an I27 homopolymer. A\nbroadening due to subtle conformational effects on the I27 domain that expose the I27 Trp\nresidue is possible, but even in this case, the fact that this broadening happens only when the\n\u03b1Syn moiety is inserted in the construct proves that direct interaction is taking place.\n\nCD spectra of 1S1 and 3T were recorded in which 1S1 shows some \u03b1-helical content in the \u03b1\nSyn moiety (Fig. 4B). . Subtraction of the contribution of the I27 linkers (2/3 of the CD of 3T\nrecorded in the same 10 mM Tris/HCl buffer) from the CD spectrum of 1S1 reveals a profile\nthat is different from that of \u03b1Syn in the same buffer condition (Fig. 4C) but similar to that of\nthe same protein in the \u03b1-helix structure induced by the addition of SDS [33]. This \u03b1-helical\ncontent might be induced by the interactions between the \u03b1Syn moiety and the I27 domains\nas discussed below and in the Supplementary Material.\nLow concentrations of Cu2+ affect the conformational equilibrium of \u03b1Syn\nIt is well known that multivalent metal cations like Cu 2+ can accelerate \u03b1Syn aggregation\n[35,36]. To validate our approach and to investigate how metal cations influence the\nconformer equilibrium of \u03b1Syn, we performed SMFS experiments on the 3S3 construct in 10\nmM Tris/HCl buffer in the presence of 1 \u03bcM CuCl2. The low concentration of copper was\n12\n\n\fchosen to target the His 50 specific copper binding site of \u03b1Syn (Kd = 0.1 \u03bcM) [36].\nThe presence of 1 \u03bcM Cu2+ moderately, but significantly (\u03c7-square statistical significance p\n< 0.01), alters the relative distribution of the \u03b1Syn conformers with respect to plain 10 mM\nTris/HCl (see Fig. 2). In particular, the relative population of the \u03b2-like conformers more than\ndoubles (from 7,2% to almost 18%), with a parallel decrease of the signals coming from\nmechanically weak interactions. An increase (from 38% to 47%) of random coil-like curves is\nalso observed.\nThe conformational equilibrium of the pathological A30P \u03b1Syn mutant is drastically\nshifted towards the \u03b2-like conformers\nThe A30P mutation is a pathogenic, naturally occurring human \u03b1Syn variant, that correlates\nwith familial Parkinsonism (OMIM reference number 163890.0002) [19]. The mutant protein\ndisplays an increased rate of oligomerization [56] and impaired degradation by chaperonemediated autophagy [57]. We tested the 3S3 \u03b1Syn-A30P construct to evaluate the capability\nof our methodology to probe different conformational propensities in mutants of the same\nprotein. We found that the A30P mutation induces a striking shift in the conformational\nequilibrium of \u03b1Syn with \"\u03b2-like\" curves being around 37% of the sample and again, a\ncorresponding decrease of signals coming from mechanically weak interactions (Figure 2). In\ncontrast with wild type \u03b1Syn incubated with Cu2+, the A30P mutant does not induce an\nincrease of random coil curves that are exactly in the same proportion observed in wild-type\n\u03b1Syn.\nThe relative population of the three classes of conformers is modified by the buffer\nconcentration\nAnother condition known to speed up \u03b1Syn aggregation is high ionic strength[26][28]. SMFS\nexperiments on the 3S3 wild type construct were performed in 500 mM Tris/HCl buffer. As\nreported in Fig. 2, the frequency of the three types of profiles radically changed in those two\nconditions. The most remarkable result is, again, the significant increase in the population of\nthe \"\u03b2-like\" structures with buffer concentration (up to about 28%) and the parallel decrease\nof the percentage of the mechanically weak structures. Again, an increase of random coil\ncurves is also observed, as occurs in the presence of Cu2+, but unlike the case of the A30P\n13\n\n\fmutant.\n\nDISCUSSION\nWe have identified the signatures of three classes of conformers in monomeric \u03b1Syn at the\nsingle molecule level. One of these classes includes structures mechanically indistinguishable\nfrom a random coil; the other two classes include \"\u03b2-like\" structures and structures kept\ntogether by short- and long-distance mechanically weak interactions (Fig.1). We have also\nobserved that their equilibrium shifts significantly depending on solution conditions or\nsequence variants related to pathological aggregation. The important result that emerges from\nthese data is the direct correlation between conditions known to increase the \u03b1Syn\naggregation propensity and the relative size of the \"\u03b2-like\" population (Fig.2).\n\nThe \"\u03b2-like\" conformers are structured conformations directly related to the\naggregation propensity\nWe observed a marked increase of the population of \"\u03b2-like\" conformers under three very\ndifferent conditions known to accelerate \u03b1Syn aggregation. This result links the population of\nthose \u03b1Syn monomeric conformers to the process of \u03b1Syn aggregation. The first condition is\nthe presence of a \u03bcM concentration of Cu2+. Our results in this condition agree with the\nobservation of a metal-induced partially folded intermediate by Uversky, Li and Fink[35].\nAlso Rasia et al. suggested a compact set of metal-induced conformations, noticing that the\nspecific binding of Cu2+ to the \u03b1Syn N-terminus requires the formation of a metal-binding\ninterface (pivoted on His 50), that possibly involves residues widely separated in the primary\namino acid sequence[36].\n\nThe second condition is the A30P mutation. NMR experiments have observed a much more\nflexible average conformation of the \u03b1Syn mutants A30P and A53T. The increased average\nflexibility of \u03b1Syn allows the protein to sample a larger conformational space. [58].\nInterestingly, the mean hydrodynamic radius of \u03b1Syn is not affected by the A30P and A53T\nmutations [21,59] thus showing that the increased flexibility is compatible with the\npopulation of compact folded structures like those singled out by our experiments.\n\n14\n\n\fThe third condition is a radical increase of the ionic strength. Our results in 500 mM Tris/HCl\ncan be reconciled with the model proposed by Hoyer et al. [26] and by Bernado et al. [28] to\nexplain the well-documented phenomenon of the increased \u03b1Syn fibril formation with\nincreasing ionic strength. According to that model, the increased fibril formation is explained\njust on the basis on an increased freedom of the fibrillogenic NAC region caused by the\nrelease of its interaction with the negatively charged C-terminal tail. The increased ionic\nstrength of the buffer leads to a more efficient charge shielding of the strongly acidic Cterminal tail, thus relieving its electrostatic self-repulsion. This in turn leads to the lowering\nof the protein-excluded volume and increases its flexibility. According to our data in Fig. 2,\nwe should add to this model a shift of the conformational equilibrium towards the \u03b2-like\nstructures that takes place on increasing the charge shielding.\n\nAre \"\u03b2-like\" structures really \u03b2?\nAny assignment of force spectroscopy signals to a definite secondary canonical structure\nmust be supported by independent structural data. We have labeled as \"\u03b2-like\" those\nconformers with a mechanical behavior closely matching those of structures rich in \u03b2-sheets.\nThe correlation of the population of these structures with aggregation conditions, that enrich\n\u03b2-sheet content in \u03b1Syn, supports this labeling. Evidence of some \u03b2-sheet content in the\nmonomeric state of \u03b1Syn was previously reported in the literature. Most recently by means of\nNMR spectroscopy in supercooled water at minus 15 C\u00b0, it was found that the \u03b1Syn chain,\ncold-denatured to an hydrodynamic radius equivalent to that displayed by the same protein in\n8 M urea, retains a surprising amount of unpacked \u03b2-strand content that correlates with the\namyloid fibril \u03b2 structure[32]. The packing of these \u03b2 strands into compact structures like\nthose observed by us is thus likely to occur in non-denaturing conditions and at physiological\ntemperatures. This NMR result supports our observation of \"\u03b2-like\" conformers in the\nmonomeric state of \u03b1Syn and links them to the amyloid \u03b2 structure. The presence of \u03b2-sheet\nstructures was indicated also by Raman spectra of this protein in aqueous solution[33]. In the\nsame investigation, CD spectroscopy proved unable to detect any \u03b2 content. Correspondingly,\nthe CD spectra of \u03b1Syn recorded by us in 10 mM and 500 mM Tris were practically\nsuperimposable. We conclude that CD is not a technique sensitive enough to detect partial \u03b2-\n\n15\n\n\fsheet content in the \u03b1Syn sample. A fraction of \u03b2-sheet/extended structure of about 19% was\nalso detected, again not by CD, but by FTIR in dried films of \u03b1Syn[60]. This fraction is much\nlarger than that estimated by our experiments in 10 mM Tris/HCl buffer (see Fig. 2).\nHowever, the conditions of the SMFS and FTIR experiments were markedly different, and in\nthe latter case, some template-mediated formation of \u03b2-structures due to the packing of the \u03b1\nSyn molecules in the dried films required by the FTIR measurements cannot be ruled out.\nIn conclusion, despite the fact that force spectroscopy data cannot directly assign a\nspecific secondary structure to the conformers we have labeled as \"\u03b2-like\", it is most likely\nthat they have significant \u03b2-sheet content.\n\n16\n\n\fFigure 4. Circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy. (A) Fluorescence spectra of \u03b1Syn, 3T and 1S1 (dotted, dashed and solid\nline, respectively). (B) Circular dichroism spectra in PBS buffer of 3T, 1S1 (solid lines). The \u03b1Syn contribution in 1S1 (dashed line) is\ncalculated by subtracting the relative contribution of the I27 domains from the CD spectrum of 1S1. (C) Circular dichroism spectra of \u03b1Syn\nin PBS (solid line) and 250 mM SDS (dotted line). The \u03b1Syn contribution in 1S1 (dashed line) is reported as in B.\n\nThe mechanically weak interactions can be both within the \u03b1Syn moiety and between \u03b1\nSyn and the I27 domains.\n17\n\n\fBy now, any structural characterization of the mechanically weak interactions events\nmonitored by the small peaks in force curves as in Fig.1D (right panels) is at best tentative,\nand falls outside the focus of the present work. A more detailed characterization of these\nevents is however within the range of capabilities of the techniques proposed here and is\nbeing currently addressed in our laboratory (see Supplementary Material for preliminary\nmeasurements). A plausible explanation of the short- and long-distance mechanically weak\ninteractions we observed cannot exclude the interaction between positively charged residues\non the \u03b1Syn N-terminal and the negatively charged surface of I27 modules[61]. It has been\ndocumented that \u03b1Syn in contact with negatively charged surfaces assumes an \u03b1-helix\nstructure [37-39,62,63]. We might expect a similar structural transition in the \u03b1Syn moiety\nalso from the contact with the I27 modules within the 3S3 or 1S1 constructs (see\nSupplementary Material). This transition is indicated by the CD spectra of the 1S1 construct\nin 10 mM Tris/HCl (see Figure 4B). We propose that the small peaks like those shown in\nFig.1D and assigned to the mechanically weak interactions can be the signature of the\ninteraction between \u03b1Syn, possibly in \u03b1-helical form, and the flanking I27 modules. It is not\nsurprising that more than one of those signals are present in the same force curves, because\nmultiple interactions of this type can occur at the same time in the same molecule. It should\nbe noted that the same transition does not take place when free \u03b1Syn is mixed in solution\nwith I27 modules of the 3T construct (see Supplementary Material). An electrostatic model,\nbased on the interaction lengths calculated from the positions of the small peaks in the force\ncurves like those displayed in Figure 1D (right panels), is proposed in the Supplementary\nMaterial.\nNotably, these short- and long-distance mechanically weak interactions are observed to be\nin equilibrium with the \"\u03b2-like\" structures. The population of the former always decreases\nwhile that of the latter increases. This result is in accord with the observation by Zhu et.al.\nthat a driving force to \u03b1-helical structures inhibits \u03b1Syn fibril formation[60] and also rule out\nany template-mediated \u03b2-sheet imprinting by the I27 linkers. This conclusion is confirmed by\nthe data on 500 mM Tris/HCl buffered solutions showing that when electrostatic interactions\nbetween the \u03b1Syn moiety and the flanking I27 linkers are decreased, the population of \"\u03b2like\" conformers increase. We can also expect entropic effects due to the presence of the\nflanking I27 domains to drive the protein towards more extended conformations rather than\n\n18\n\n\fcompact conformations [64,65].\nThese considerations indicate that the design and usage of alternative linkers or\nexperimental strategies may prove useful in the future to further discriminate the effective\nconformational distribution of \u03b1Syn from alterations due to the interaction with the linkers.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFor the first time we applied the AFM-based single-molecule mechanical unfolding\nmethodology to a multimodular protein containing the \u03b1Syn moiety. This approach brings\ninto play three main methodological capabilities inaccessible to the bulk ensemble-averaged\nspectroscopies previously applied to study the structure of \u03b1Syn and other natively\nunstructured proteins.\nThe first is the possibility to work strictly at the single molecule level, thus ensuring that the\nconformer distribution of the monomeric \u03b1Syn is detected and quantified without\ninterference from oligomeric soluble forms of the protein and therefore of any possible\nintermolecular imprinting towards the amyloidogenic \u03b2-structures.\nThe second capability is that of spanning the conformational space of the protein under\ninvestigation and of directly catching and quantifying all of its conformers with a lifetime\nlonger than 10-3 sec. These conformers, because of their longer life time, might be the most\nbiologically relevant. Three classes of the monomeric \u03b1Syn conformations, including random\ncoil, mechanically weakly folded and \u03b2-like were characterized by our experiments. They\ncould be detected even in low concentration without the necessity of selectively enhancing\none of them by adding specific agents to unbalance the conformational equilibrium, as most\ncommonly done so far with bulk ensemble-averaged experiments.\nThe third capability is that of following shifts in the population of these classes of conformers\nin response to changing the solution conditions or the protein sequence and to detect them\neven if scarcely populated. In the case of \u03b1Syn, conditions known to promote oligomerization\nand aggregation like the presence of Cu2+, the A30P mutation, or a radical increase of ionic\nstrength, markedly shift its conformational equilibrium towards the \"\u03b2-like\" form at the\nexpense of other structures. These results indicate that the \"\u03b2-like\" curves contain the\nsignature of the structural precursor to \u03b1Syn oligomerization. We suggest that the different\naggregation propensities and, ultimately, the pathogenicity displayed by \u03b1Syn under different\n\n19\n\n\fenvironmental conditions or point mutations can be triggered by unbalance introduced into\nthe delicate equilibria among \u03b1Syn conformers.\nThese capabilities suggest that in the near future single molecule methodologies will play\na crucial role in studies of the folding equilibria of the NUPs monomers and in particular, in\nthe detection and quantification of the conformers that can lead to aggregation of those\nproteins. Our results suggest the feasibility of single-molecule approaches to the testing of\nnovel pharmacological or biophysical therapies for pathologies involving the conformational\nequilibria of NUPs.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nPolyprotein design and expression. We followed the protein construct design proposed by J.\nFernandez for the study of the random coiled titin N2B segment [41]. Chimeric polyproteins\nwere obtained starting from pAFM1-4, pAFM5-8 and pAFM(I27)3mer vectors, kindly\nprovided by Prof. Jane Clarke (Cambridge University) and constructed according to Ref.\n[43]. \u03b1Syn or its A30P mutated sequences were amplified by PCR using two different pairs\nof primers, each containing unique restriction sites. A first pair contained KpnI and XbaI sites\nand a second one SacI and BssHII sites. The original eight I27 module plasmid was\nreconstituted from pAFM1-4 and pAFM5-8, obtaining pAFM8m vector. pAFM8m was then\ndigested with KpnI and XbaI and ligated to the amplified \u03b1Syn sequence, cleaved by the\nsame enzymes in substitution of the two central titin modules to give the pAFM3s3 vector\n(see Supplementary Material). By a similar strategy, the pAFM(I27)3mer vector was digested\nwith SacI and BssHII, and the central titin module replaced by \u03b1Syn sequence, obtaining the\npAFM1s1 vector. The obtained expression plasmids, pAFM3s3 and pAFM1s1, code for two\nchimeric polyproteins composed of a single \u03b1Syn module flanked on either side by three\ntandem I27 domains or by just one, named 3S3 and 1S1, respectively. The two pAFM8m and\npAFM(I27)3mer vectors (coding for two recombinant poly(I27) proteins named 8T and 3T)\nwere transformed into E. coli C41(DE3) cells [66] (obtained from Professor John E. Walker\n(MRC \u2013 Dunn Human Nutrition Unit, Cambridge) with the agreement of the Medical\nResearch Council center of Cambridge). The cells were grown and the expression of proteins\nwas induced as described in [43]. Recombinant proteins were purified by Ni2+-affinity\nchromatography in 20mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 8, 500 mM NaCl; the elution from\nthe resin was obtained with 20 mM imidazole. After dialysis, proteins were kept at -80\u00b0C in\n\n20\n\n\fPBS with 15% glycerol. The purification gel is shown in Supplementary Material.\nCD Experiments - CD measurements were carried out on a JASCO J-715 spectropolarimeter\ninterfaced with a PC. The CD spectra were acquired and processed using the J-700 program\nfor Windows\u00ae. All experiments were carried out at room temperature using HELLMA quartz\ncells with Suprasil\u00ae windows and an optical path-length of 0.1 cm. Spectra were recorded in\nthe 190-260 nm wavelength range using a bandwidth of 2 nm and a time constant of 2 s at a\nscan speed of 50 nm/min. The signal-to-noise ratio was improved by accumulating at least\nfour scans. All spectra are reported in terms of mean residue molar ellipticity [\u0398]R (deg cm2\ndmol \u20131).\nFluorescence experiments - Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer\nLS 50 spectrofluorimeter equipped with a thermostated cell compartment and interfaced with\na personal computer using the FL-WinLab program for Windows\u00ae. Sample measurements\nwere carried out using a HELLMA ultra-micro cell with Suprasil\u00ae windows and an optical\npath length of 10 x 2 mm. Fluorescence spectra were obtained at 25 \u00b0C using an excitation\nwavelength of 288, with an excitation bandwidth of 4 nm and emission bandwidth of 4 nm.\nEmission spectra were recorded between 290-380 nm at a scan rate of 60\nnm/min.\nBuffer elemental analysis. Due to the well known structuring effects of divalent metal ions on\n\u03b1Syn [35], an accurate elemental analysis of the buffer was performed to exclude artifacts in\nour results due to metal contamination. The high concentration Tris-buffer solution (500 mM)\nwas analyzed for metal contents by atomic absorption spectroscopies. The measured\nconcentrations were Cu = 0.2 \u00b1 0.1 nM, Zn = 3.5 \u00b1 0.1 nM, Fe = 0.9 \u00b1 0.1 nM, and Ca =\n22.5 \u00b1 0.1 nM. These values are two orders of magnitude lower than the concentration\nrequired to induce structural effects on \u03b1Syn [67].\nSurface preparation. Gold (Alfa Aesar, 99.99%) was deposited onto freshly cleaved mica\nsubstrates (Mica New York Corp., clear ruby muscovite) in a high vacuum evaporator\n(Denton Vacuum Inc., model DV502-A) at 10-5 Torr. Before deposition, the mica was\npreheated to 350 \u00b0C by a heating stage mounted behind the mica to enhance the formation of\nterraced Au(111) domains. The typical evaporation rate was 3 \u00c5/s, and the thickness of the\n\n21\n\n\fgold films ranged around 300 nm. The mica temperature was maintained at 350 \u00b0C for 2\nhours after deposition for annealing. This method produced samples with flat Au(111)\nterraces. These films were fixed to a glass substrate with an epoxy (EPO-TEK 377, Epoxy\nTech.). They were then separated at the gold-mica interface by peeling immediately before\nfunctionalization with the desired molecules. This procedure produced gold substrates with a\nflat surface morphology due to the templating effect of the atomically flat mica surface\n[68,69].\nForce spectroscopy experiments. For each experiment, a 20 \u03bcL drop of 3S3 construct solution\n(160 \u03bcg/mL) was deposited on the freshly peeled gold surface for about 20 minutes. Single\nmolecule force spectroscopy experiments were performed using a commercially available\nAFM system: Picoforce AFM with Nanoscope IIIa controller (Digital Instruments, Santa\nBarbara, CA) using V-shaped silicon nitride cantilevers (NP; Digital Instruments, Santa\nBarbara, CA) with a spring constant calibrated by the thermal noise method [70]. The pulling\nspeed was 2.18 \u03bcm/s for all experiments. The buffer used was Tris/HCl (10 mM or 500 mM,\npH 7.5; the 10 mM buffer was obtained by diluting the 500 mM buffer with milliQ ultrapure\nwater). For CuCl2 experiments, the protein was deposited in a drop with the addition of a\nfinal concentration of 1 \u03bcM CuCl2 and left on the surface for about 20 minutes, and the\nexperiments were carried out in 10 mM Tris/HCl with 1 \u03bcM CuCl2. Control experiments in\nDTT were made in 50 mM DTT Tris/HCl buffer.\nData analysis. The force curves were analyzed using the commercially available software\nfrom Digital Instrument (Nanoscope v6.12r2), custom Origin scripts and Hooke, a Pythonbased home coded force spectroscopy data analysis program (M. Sandal, to be published).\nForce curves were analyzed fitting each peak with a simple WLC force vs. extension model\n[45] with two free parameters: the contour length L and the persistence length p (eq. 1). The\nI27 modules were characterized in terms of the length of the polypeptide chain extended after\neach unfolding event.\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\nk bT \uf8ef x\n1\n1\uf8fa\nF(x) =\n+\n\u2212\n2\np \uf8efL\n4\uf8fa\n\uf8eb x\uf8f6\n4\uf8ec1 \u2212 \uf8f7\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ed L\uf8f8\n\uf8f0\n\uf8fb\n\n(eq. 1)\n\nTo assess the statistical validity of the comparison between data obtained in 10 mM Tris/HCl\nbuffer and those obtained in other conditions, standard chi square tests were performed. The\n\n22\n\n\fdifferences between the 10 mM Tris data set and the other data sets are significant with p <\n0.01.\n\nSUPPORTING INFORMATION\nFigure S1. (top panel) Schematic diagram of pAFM3s3 vector obtained from cloning \u03b1Syn\nsequence in J. Clarke's pRSET A modified vector and (bottom panel) representation of the\nchimeric protein 3S3 coded by the cloned DNA sequence. Titin module numbers refers to the\noriginal vector described in the work of Steward et. al . pAFM (I27)3mer and pAFM1s1\nvectors and corresponding chimeric protein (respectively 3T, 1S1) can be described with\nsimilar diagrams (see article text).\nFigure S2. Sample of purified 3S3, SDS-10% PAGE and Western blot analysis. (MW),\nmolecular mass markers (Amersham Biosciences); (lane a), final product of immobilized\nmetal affinity chromatography (IMAC) purification of 3S3 chimeric protein; (lane b),\nWestern blotting with anti-His tag Ab; (lane c), Western blotting with anti-\u03b1Syn Ab. The\narrow indicate a band corresponding to 3S3 protein with an expected molecular weight of\n78119 Da which is in good agreement with observed electrophoretical mobility. The lower\nband that is copurified with 3S3 is recognised only by the anti-His tag Ab, indicating that it is\nprobably an abortive product of translation that does not contain \u03b1Syn and, consequently, the\nlast three titin modules with the two final cysteines, necessary for linking the protein to the\ngold surface. The lower band recognised in lane c is present also in negative controls (data not\nshown) so it can be considered an aspecific band.\nFigure S3. Gaussian kernel density estimation of the Mechanically Weak Interaction lengths\nunder different conditions. Briefly, a Gaussian function (kernel) has been centered on each\ndata point for each data set. The sum of the kernels,normalized to have unitary integral, is the\nKDE plot. Kernel bandwidth h (i.e. the Gaussian kernel standard deviation) was\nautomatically calculated for each data set such that it minimizes the asymptotic mean\nintegrated square error:\n\n\uf8eb1 \uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8eb 4 \uf8f6\uf8ec\nh = \u03c3\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\uf8ed 5 \uf8f8 ,\n\uf8ed 3n \uf8f8\n\nwhere \u03c3 is the standard deviation of data and n is the\n\n23\n\n\fsize of the data set. The plot has been calculated using Statistics for Python (http:\n//bonsai.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~mdehoon/software/python/Statistics/).\nFigure S4. An electrostatic model that may explain mechanically weak interactions. (A)\nSchematic representation of the central portion of 3S3 construct, evidencing the I27 modules\nflanking the \u03b1Syn element (named I27N and I27C, see text). In the \u03b1Syn moiety three\nregions are evidenced: i) the amphipatic region, prone to fold in \u03b1-helical structures when in\ncontact with phospholipid membranes; ii) the fibrillogenic NAC region, characteristic of the\nfibrils core of \u03b1Syn amyloid; and iii) the acidic C-terminal tail, strongly charged and not\nprone to assume any fold. The reported quotes correspond to interactions that may lead to the\nsmall peaks observed in curves featuring mechanically weak interactions (see text). The\ncolors of the different regions depict the electrostatic potential: red for the negatively charged\nI27 (see text) and for the acidic C-terminal region of \u03b1Syn; white for the hydrophobic NAC\nregion of \u03b1Syn; and blue for the positively charged amphipatic region of \u03b1Syn. (B) Cartoon\n(left panels) and solid surface representations of the electrostatic potential (central and right\npanels) of titin I27 domain obtained using the program DeepView . I27 coordinates were\ntaken from the Protein Data Bank (PDB code: 1WAA). In the cartoon, the secondary\nstructure elements are colored in blue for \u03b2-strands. Surfaces were colored according to the\ncalculated electrostatic potential contoured from -5.0 kT/e (intense red) to +5.0 (where k =\nBoltzman constant, T = absolute temperature, and e = electron charge) (intense blue). The\nmolecular orientation in the central panel is the same as that in the cartoon (left panel),\nwhereas that in the right panel is rotated by 180\u00b0 about the vertical axis.\nFigure S5. Mixing \u03b1Syn and I27 in solution does not induce \u03b1Syn helical folding. CD\nspectra of: the 3T construct in PBS 1X e glycerol 15% (red), \u03b1Syn in PBS 1X e glycerol 15%\n(black), a mixture of 3T and \u03b1Syn (green), a mixture of the two protein without the 3T\ncontribution (blue). \u03b1Syn concentration was 10 \u03bcM and the ratio with the 3T construct was\nadjusted in order to have a ratio of one \u03b1Syn per two I27 modules. The spectra indicate that to\ninduce the helical conformation in \u03b1Syn by I27 a close and constrained contact is necessary.\nIt is very difficult to obtain this very high local concentration condition in a mixing\n24\n\n\fexperiment.\nProtocol S1.

(A)\nSchematic representation of the central portion of 3S3 construct, evidencing the I27 modules\nflanking the \u03b1Syn element (named I27N and I27C, see text). In the \u03b1Syn moiety three\nregions are evidenced: i) the amphipatic region, prone to fold in \u03b1-helical structures when in\ncontact with phospholipid membranes; ii) the fibrillogenic NAC region, characteristic of the\nfibrils core of \u03b1Syn amyloid; and iii) the acidic C-terminal tail, strongly charged and not\nprone to assume any fold. The reported quotes correspond to interactions that may lead to the\nsmall peaks observed in curves featuring mechanically weak interactions (see text). The\ncolors of the different regions depict the electrostatic potential: red for the negatively charged\nI27 (see text) and for the acidic C-terminal region of \u03b1Syn; white for the hydrophobic NAC\nregion of \u03b1Syn; and blue for the positively charged amphipatic region of \u03b1Syn. (B) Cartoon\n(left panels) and solid surface representations of the electrostatic potential (central and right\npanels) of titin I27 domain obtained using the program DeepView . I27 coordinates were\ntaken from the Protein Data Bank (PDB code: 1WAA). In the cartoon, the secondary\nstructure elements are colored in blue for \u03b2-strands. Surfaces were colored according to the\ncalculated electrostatic potential contoured from -5.0 kT/e (intense red) to +5.0 (where k =\nBoltzman constant, T = absolute temperature, and e = electron charge) (intense blue). The\nmolecular orientation in the central panel is the same as that in the cartoon (left panel),\nwhereas that in the right panel is rotated by 180\u00b0 about the vertical axis.\n\n34\n\n\fFigure S5. Mixing \u03b1Syn and I27 in solution does not induce \u03b1Syn helical folding. CD\nspectra of: the 3T construct in PBS 1X e glycerol 15% (red), \u03b1Syn in PBS 1X e glycerol 15%\n(black), a mixture of 3T and \u03b1Syn (green), a mixture of the two protein without the 3T\ncontribution (blue). \u03b1Syn concentration was 10 \u03bcM and the ratio with the 3T construct was\nadjusted in order to have a ratio of one \u03b1Syn per two I27 modules. The spectra indicate that to\ninduce the helical conformation in \u03b1Syn by I27 a close and constrained contact is necessary.\nIt is very difficult to obtain this very high local concentration condition in a mixing\nexperiment.\n\n35\n\n\fProtocol S1. Supplementary Results and Discussion.\n\nThe distribution of mechanically weak interaction lengths is differently affected by\nvariations in the environment or protein sequence.\nWe characterized the mechanically weak interactions (see text, Fig.1D) by measuring the\ndistance between the contour length of events attributed to them and the contour length\nmeasured on the first I27 peak in the same curves, both obtaind by a double-parameter WLC\nfit. This value should correspond to the chain segment length enclosed by the mechanically\nweak interactions . The larger set of mechanically weak interactions events is that obtained on\nTris 10 mM (nMWITris\n\n10mM\n\n= 19). Data recorded in other conditions show a significant\n\ndecrease in the occurrence of mechanically weak events. The resulting data sets are too small\nfor a significant statistical comparison to be made for each condition, but allow to visualize\ngeneral trends.\nWe tried to understand the underlying trends by using kernel density estimation (KDE) to\nobtain a sketch of the probability density function of interaction lengths. This refined method\ndoes not suffer of biases in the choice of binning boundaries and allows for a more objective\nvisualization of small data sets than a classical histogram.\nThe KDE plot (Supplementary Material Figure 3) of the interaction lengths found in Tris 10\nmM and the Tris 10 mM + 1 \u03bcM CuCl2 for mechanically weak interactions events are almost\nperfectly superimposable, despite the difference in the size of the data set (nMWICu 1 \u03bcM = 5).\nThe larger number of data in plain Tris 10 mM allows nonetheless to distinguish a bimodal\ndistribution distinguishing mechanically weak interactions enclosing loops of 11 and 25 nm.\nExperiments conducted with 500 mM buffer concentration (nMWITris 500 mM = 8) and the A30P\nmutant (nMWIA30P = 6) show instead a broadening of the KDE and allow to infer a shift from\nshort- to long-distance interactions.\n\nThese preliminary data seem to indicate an increase of the conformational freedom of the\ncorrespondent architectures. This is in line with the observed increased flexibility of the \u03b1Syn\n36\n\n\fchain in presence of the A30P mutation . Instead, as previously discussed, in the case of\nadded Cu2+ ions, the reason for the increase of \u03b2-like structures lies most probably in the\nstabilization of the metal binding interface centered around His 50, and not on a broad effect\non the protein flexibility. However larger data sets will be required to confirm these\nconclusions.\nA model of the mechanically weak interactions\nConsidering electrostatic and hydrophobic features of the different construct domains, we\ncan try, very tentatively, to associate the mechanically weak interactions with those of\ndifferent domains within the 3S3 construct. We can sketch and divide the overall structure of\n\u03b1Syn into three main regions: the amphipatic N-terminal tail (aa 1-61), positively charged\nbecause of its Lys residues; a hydrophobic central (aa 61-95) region containing the\nfibrillogenic NAC segment; and the highly negatively charged acidic C-terminal tail. In the\n3S3 construct the \u03b1Syn N- and C- termini are flanked by partially negatively charged I27\nmodules (Fig. 5) , that we label I27N and I27C, respectively. Contacts between the negatively\ncharged region of I27N and the positive \u03b1Syn N-terminal would appear as peaks that\ncorrespond to short-range distances along the primary structure: lower than or equal to 21 nm.\nThe peaks in the middle-range distance of 21-33 nm, and those in the long-range distance of\n27-49 nm might correspond to contacts of I27N with the central region of \u03b1Syn, and to\ncontacts of the \u03b1Syn N-terminal with either the I27C or the \u03b1Syn C-terminal, respectively.\nThe increase of the electrostatic shielding with the buffer concentration has two main\neffects. First, the population of the mechanically weak interaction featuring structures\ndecreases from about 55% to 23% (see text, Fig. 2), most likely because the interactions with\nthe I27 domains that drive \u03b1Syn towards \u03b1-helical structures are less favored. Second, the\nrigidity of the C-terminal tail is decreased as also evidenced by the shift from the short- to the\nlong-distance intermolecular interactions with the increase of the buffer concentration (see\nSupplementary Material Figure 3). This reduction of rigidity is associated to an increased\nconformational freedom of the whole \u03b1Syn moiety, and most importantly of its NAC region .\n\n37\n\n\fThe intertwining of both effects can shift the conformational equilibrium towards the \u03b2-\nlike structures. In fact, their population increases from about 7% to almost 30% on passing\nfrom 10 to 500mM Tris/HCl buffer (Fig. 2A).\n\nIt is also possible that mechanically weak interaction events contain the signature of the\nunlocking of \u03b1Syn intramolecular interactions. These latter interactions can sustain the fairly\ncompact structures reported by many authors already , even if their distribution is in our\nexperiments affected by the insertion of the \u03b1Syn moiety in the 3S3 construct. For instance\nthe electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged I27 modules should hinder the\nlong-range contacts between the C- and N-terminal domains proposed by several authors (see\nbelow, and Fig. 5) .\nSupplementary References:\n\n38\n\n\f"}
