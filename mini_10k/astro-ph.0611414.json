Reverse shock emission\nwas expected to be common (Sari & Piran 1999), so it has come as a surprise that nearly\nall rapidly-detected GRB afterglows show scant evidence of it. There are alternatives to\nthe standard \"internal shocks\" formulation for prompt emission. Such models include, e.g.,\nexternal shocks (Meszaros & Rees 1993) or magnetic reconnection (Meszaros et al. 1994;\nThompson 1994; Usov 1994) as the mechanism to release energy as \u03b3-rays. The nature of\nGRB prompt emission is best investigated in conjunction with prompt observations at lower\nfrequencies, with ongoing measurements at the same frequency to connect to the longerlasting, and better understood, afterglow.\nThe Swift XRT's early X-ray observations have revealed a nearly standard morphology\nseen in most bursts' X-ray afterglow (Nousek et al. 2006; O'Brien et al. 2006). The typical\nearly X-ray afterglow includes two surprises: a stage of relatively slow decay preceding the\nfaster decline, known from pre-Swift observations, hours to days post-burst, and flaring well\nafter the cessation of \u03b3-ray emission. To connect this interesting early behavior to the later\nafterglow evolution, it is essential to compare such high-energy emission to lower-energy\nevolution. Such comparisons elucidate which features also occur at low energies, indicating\na process affecting the entire early afterglow rather than a separate high-energy component\n(see GRB 050801, Rykoff et al. 2006).\nThere is a small but growing sample of events for which it is possible to compare\nthe very early optical lightcurve with X-ray emission (or in the case of prompt optical\ndetections, the GRB emission itself). To date no consistent connection between prompt\noptical observations and the contemporaneous \u03b3-rays has emerged (e.g., see the discussion\nin Rykoff et al. 2005b). We present here two new cases of contemporaneous optical and highenergy observations. For GRB 051109A, the initial optical detection is prompt with respect\nto the \u03b3-rays, and is followed by significant overlap with X-ray observations. GRB 051111\ndoes not have early X-ray observations, but the optical lightcurve has significant temporal\noverlap (several detections) with the Swift BAT \u03b3-ray detections.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. The events and our observations are described\nin \u00a7 2. \u00a7 3 gives technical details for the data reduction, and \u00a7\u00a7 4,4.1, and 4.3 detail the optical\nand high-energy transformations to spectral flux densities. \u00a7\u00a7 4.2 and 4.4 indicate the key\nfeatures of the optical and high-energy lightcurves, respectively. We discuss the lightcurves\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nin the context of the fireball model of afterglows. \u00a7 5 summarizes important spectral and\ntemporal predictions of this model. The subsequent sections discuss the lightcurves and\nbroadband comparisons. \u00a7 6 compares optical and X-ray in GRB 051109A. It is divided\ninto several subsections: \u00a7 6.1 examines the relative complexity of the X-ray during the first\nhour, as compared to the steadily declining optical, \u00a7 6.2 discusses the data near 0.5 day,\nsuggestive of achromatic steepening, while \u00a7 6.3 looks at explanations and \u00a7 6.4 notes the\nsimilarity of the GRB 051111 optical lightcurve break near 1 ksec. \u00a7 7 analyzes the prompt\noptical emission of GRB 051111, which includes a flux excess while high-energy emission is\ndetected. This excess is compared to other prompt cases. \u00a7 8 summarizes the conclusions.\nWe use \u03b1 to indicate temporal decay indices, and \u03b2 for spectral indices, with flux density\nf\u03bd \u221d t\u03b1 \u03bd \u03b2 . To designate a spectral region, subscripts \"OPT\", \"X\", and \"\u03b3\" indicate an index\nfor the optical, X-ray, and \u03b3-ray bands respectively. A spectral index spanning two regions\nis indicated with both, e.g., \u03b2OP T \u2212X for the spectral index interpolating between the optical\nand X-ray frequencies.\nIn the following, X-ray fluxes are measured in the band from 0.2\u201310 keV, and \u03b3-ray\nfluxes correspond to 15\u2013150 keV (in the observed frame). The spectral shapes of higher\nfrequency bands are reported as photon indices, \u0393 (dn/d\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u0393 ). Note that the spectral\nindex \u03b2 is related to the photon index \u0393, by \u03b2 = 1 \u2212 \u0393.\n\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nThe optical observations presented were taken by three observatories. The instruments\nare described, followed by a description of the instruments' responses to the events, and the\nXRT response to GRB 051109A.\nThe ROTSE-III array is a worldwide network of 0.45 m robotic, automated telescopes,\nbuilt for fast (\u223c 6 s) responses to GRB triggers from satellites such as HETE-2 and Swift.\nThey have a wide (1.\u25e6 85 \u00d7 1.\u25e6 85) field of view (FOV) imaged onto Marconi 2048 \u00d7 2048 backilluminated thinned CCDs, and operate without filters, with sensitivity from approximately\n400 to 900 nm. ROTSE-IIIb is located at McDonald Observatory in Texas. The ROTSE-III\nsystems are described in detail in Akerlof et al. (2003).\nThe MDM Observatory is located at Kitt Peak, Arizona. It includes the 1.3m and\nthe 2.4m Hiltner telescope. The 2.4m has three CCDs, with FOVs from 3.3 to 9.6 arcmin,\nwhich were used for the GRB 051109A observations. RETROCAM is the Retractable Optical\nCamera for Monitoring, an Apogee ALTA E55 (1152 \u00d7 770 pixels, with a scale of 0.\u2032\u2032 26 per\npixel). Wilbur is a LORAL front side-illuminated CCD (2048 \u00d7 2048 pixels, with a scale of\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n0.\u2032\u2032 17 per pixel). Echelle is an SITe thinned, back side-illuminated CCD (2048 \u00d7 2048 pixels,\nwith a scale of 0.\u2032\u2032 28 per pixel). These CCDs operate with standard filters. The 1.3m has an\nSITe backside illuminated CCD (17\u2032FOV, with 0.\u2032\u2032 508 per pixel), with a Harris R filter used\nfor the late observation of GRB 051111. Further details for all instruments are available at\nthe MDM website1\nThe RUCCD instrument is installed on the 3.67 m Advanced Electro-Optical System\n(AEOS) telescope at the Air Force Maui Optical and Supercomputing (AMOS) site, located\nat 10,033 ft in Haleakala, Hawaii. The camera is a 2048 \u00d7 2048 front-illuminated CCD, covering a 45\u2032\u2032 FOV. The instrument incorporates an extensive set of optics options (polarizers,\ngratings, and filters), which includes standard V , R and I filters. The RUCCD system is\ndescribed in detail in Smith et al. (2005).\n\n2.1.\n\nGRB 051109A\n\nOn 2005 November 9, Swift detected GRB 051109A (Swift trigger 163136) at 01:12:20\nUT. The position was distributed as a Gamma-ray burst Coordinates Network (GCN) notice\nat 01:12:49 UT, with a 3\u2032 radius error box, 29 s after the start of the burst (Tagliaferri et al.\n2005). The burst had a duration of 36 \u00b1 2 s (90% duration, 15\u2013350 keV), with a fluence of\n2.1 \u00d7 10\u22126 erg cm\u22122 in the 15\u2013150 keV band (Fenimore et al. 2005). Quimby et al. (2005)\nmeasured an absorption redshift of 2.346 for the event with the HET telescope, a few hours\nafter the burst.\nROTSE-IIIb responded automatically to the GCN notice, with the first exposure starting at 01:12:52.7 UT, 32 s after the burst onset and before the cessation of \u03b3-ray activity.\nThe automated scheduler began a program of ten 5-s exposures, ten 20-s exposures, and 202\n60-s exposures. Near real-time analysis of the ROTSE-III images detected a 15th magnitude\nfading source at \u03b1 = 22h 01m 15.s 3, \u03b4 = +40\u25e649\u2032 23.\u2032\u2032 3 (J2000.0) that was not visible on the\nDigitized Sky Survey2 red plates. This was reported via the GCN Circular e-mail exploder\nwithin 9 minutes of the burst (Rykoff et al. 2005a).\nSwift slewed immediately to the burst position, and the XRT began X-ray observations\n120 sec after this trigger (Tagliaferri et al. 2005). An uncatalogued X-ray source was detected\nat \u03b1 = 21h 01m 15.s 24, \u03b4 = +40\u25e6 49\u2032 23.\u2032\u2032 2, (J2000.0) with an estimated uncertainty of 3.5\u2032\u2032\n(90% confidence level), 0.7\u2032\u2032 from the ROTSE coordinates. This position takes into account\n1\n\nhttp://mdm.kpno.noao.edu/\n\n2\n\nhttp://archive.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/dss form\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nthe correction for the misalignment between the telescope and the satellite optical axis\n(Moretti et al. 2006). Due to orbital pointing constraints, no XRT observations were made\nfrom t \u2248 200\u20133000 sec, following which the field was visited continually for 16 days, for a\ntotal of \u223c283 ksec in 18 observations.\nThe MDM Observatory began r-band observations 38 minutes after the burst, following\nthe initial ROTSE GCN report. 23 exposures were taken of the GRB field, spanning a total\nof 2.5 hours. Over the next 12 days there were 4 further followup observations.\nMDM reobserved the afterglow of GRB 051109A on 2006 June 29.456 UT (mid-exposure),\napproximately 20 Msec after the event. The observations consisted of four 600s R-band exposures acquired under superb (0\u2032\u2032.8) seeing conditions. At the location of the afterglow, we\ndetect a faint, extended object that we interpret to be the host galaxy of this event.\n\n2.2.\n\nGRB 051111\n\nOn 2005 November 11, Swift detected GRB 051111 (Swift trigger 163438) at 05:59:41\nUT. The position was distributed as a Gamma-ray burst Coordinates Network (GCN) notice\nat 06:00:02 UT, with a 3\u2032 radius error box, 20.5 s after the start of the burst. The Moon's\npointing constraint prevented Swift's narrow-field instruments from being brought to bear on\nthe GRB position immediately, and there are no early X-ray data (Sakamoto et al. 2005b).\nThe burst had a 90% duration of 47 \u00b1 1 s (15\u2013350 keV), but there is extended emission to\n>80 s, and the burst's fluence was 3.9 \u00d7 10\u22126 erg cm\u22122 (15\u2013150 keV) (Krimm et al. 2005a).\nHill et al. (2005) measured an absorption redshift of 1.55 for the event with the HIRES\ninstrument at the Keck telescope, an hour after the burst.\nROTSE-IIIb responded automatically to the GCN notice in 6.4 s with the first exposure\nstarting at 06:00:08.4 UT, 26.9 s after the burst onset and before the cessation of \u03b3-ray\nactivity. The automated scheduler began a program of 10 5-s exposures, 10 20-s exposures,\nand 272 60-s exposures. Near real-time analysis of the ROTSE-III images detected a 13th\nmagnitude fading source at \u03b1 = 23h 12m 33.s 2, \u03b4 = +18\u25e6 22\u2032 29.\u2032\u2032 1 (J2000.0) that was not visible\non the Digitized Sky Survey2 red plates, which we reported via the GCN Circular e-mail\nexploder within 8.3 minutes of the burst (Rujopakarn et al. 2005).\nThe RUCCD instrument responded to the GCN notice, with its first observation at\n06:31:27 UT, 32 minutes after the burst. A series of 30-s observations of the GRB and a\nstandard star were performed until 07:08:03 UT, using the V RI filters, and initially reported\nin Smith & Swan (2005).\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nThe MDM 1.3m telescope performed observations 1 day after the GRB event. 75 minutes\nof R-band exposures were obtained over a period of 2 hours.\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nData Reductions\n\nOptical Data Reductions\n\nROTSE-III images were reduced and processed using the RPHOT pipeline, with routines\nbased upon DAOPHOT (Stetson 1987). Objects were identified via SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts\n1996) and calibrated astrometrically and photometrically with the USNOB1.0 catalog. The\nmethod is fully described in Quimby et al. (2006), for the case of a well-separated counterpart, such as GRB 051111. The final result is a set of PSF-fit photometric data.\nThe ROTSE-III instruments have 3\u2032\u2032 .25 pixels, and in the case of GRB 051109A the\noptical transient (OT) is partially blended with a nearby (8\u2032\u2032 ) 17th magnitude star at \u03b1 =\n22h 01m 14.s 60, \u03b4 = +40\u25e6 49\u2032 25.\u2032\u2032 3. It was therefore necessary to remove this contaminating\nsource prior to measuring the flux of the OT, especially in images where the OT's flux has\nfaded to or below a similar level. To accomplish this, we first constructed a deep reference\nimage using ROTSE-III data obtained well after the OT had faded below our detection\nlimits. We measured the position and brightness of the contaminating star on this frame.\nThe star is then removed from a given image by subtracting the locally determined PSF\nscaled to the appropriate flux level at the star's position.\nWith the contaminating source removed, the GRB 051109A OT light curve was extracted as described in Quimby et al. (2006). The PSF-fit and larger aperture light curves\nflatten out after \u223c 1 ksec post-burst. However, the light curve resulting from the smallest\naperture (1\u03c3 radius, \u2248 3.5\u2032\u2032 ), which does not significantly overlap the contaminating star,\ninstead continues fading at the same rate. This demonstrates that residual light from the\nnearby star remains despite our efforts to remove it. As the behavior of the 1\u03c3 radius aperture should have little contamination from the neighboring star, and since its light curve\nagrees with the behavior of the MDM data obtained simultaneously (see below), we adopt\nthese results as the best estimate of the GRB 051109A OT light curve. There are no significant quantitative differences between the 1\u03c3 radius and PSF-fit flux estimates in frames\nwhen the OT was brighter than 17th mag. The estimated additional flux error due to slight\nmisplacements of these small apertures is negligible and is not included in the results.\nWe have no data on afterglow color information for either GRB 051109A or GRB 051111\nat early times. Thus, no additional color corrections for R-band equivalence have been\napplied to the ROTSE-III unfiltered data, and the magnitudes quoted are then treated as\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nR-band and referred to as \"CR \".\nThe MDM data were processed using standard IRAF/DAOPHOT procedures. Aperture\nphotometry was performed in a 1.\u2032\u2032 5 radius aperture (average seeing was a \u223c 1.\u2032\u2032 4 FWHM)\ncentered on the OT and nearby field stars. All GRB 051109A observations, except the final\ntwo, were performed with Sloan or Gunn r filters. With no r standards in the MDM field,\nthe GRB 051109A r observations are converted to an R-equivalent value and presented in\nTable 1 as \"rR \". This is accomplished using differential photometry with respect to two USNOB1.0 R standards in the field (at \u03b1, \u03b4 = 22h 01m 15.s 663, +40\u25e6 48\u2032 19.\u2032\u2032 01 and 22h 01m 10.s 444,\n+40\u25e6 49\u2032 50.\u2032\u2032 16). The single GRB 051111 R-band point was calibrated with 5 USNOB1.0 stars\nwithin 3\u2032 of the OT.\nThe late (host) observation of GRB 051109A used the same aperture size as the early\nOT observations (1.\u2032\u2032 5). As the seeing was good (0.\u2032\u2032 9), and the galaxy appears compact, the\naperture includes the total light contribution of the galaxy. The measurement corresponds\nto Rhost = 23.70 \u00b1 0.16, but does not change within the uncertainties when using aperture\nsizes from 0.\u2032\u2032 8\u20132.\u2032\u2032 1. Assuming the scaling of star-formation rate (SFR) to UV continuum\nluminosity of Kennicutt (1998), the implied uncorrected SFR in the host galaxy is \u2248 18\nM\u2299 yr\u22121 . This value indicates a moderate SFR, when compared to starburst galaxies, as in\nprevious cases (e.g., Christensen et al. 2004). Using an astrometric solution derived from a\nset of suitable field stars also present in earlier images, we find that the afterglow position\nis offset from the center of this galaxy by less than 0\u2032\u2032.11 (\u00b10\u2032\u2032.15).\nThe RUCCD data were reduced using IRAF procedures and processed for aperture\nphotometry with the IRAF 2.12.2 qphot package. A standard star, BD+42 4211, from the\nBright Northern BVRI Standards3 was observed between the two sets of GRB observations\n(the first set from 2\u20132.5 ksec, and the second from 3\u20134 ksec post-trigger). Its observations\nwere used to reference the V RI GRB observations to absolute photometry.\nThe final optical magnitudes from these instruments are listed in the tables. Table 1\ngives the GRB 051109A results, and Table 2 the GRB 051111 results.\n\n3.2.\n\nHigh-Energy Data Reductions\n\nThe GRB 051109A XRT data were first processed by the Swift Data Center at NASA/GSFC\ninto Level 1 products (event lists). This includes the initial 2.5 sec image, and the following\nWindowed Timing (WT) and Photon Counting (PC) observations (until 3440 sec, and after\n3\n\nhttp://stupendous.cis.rit.edu/tass/refs/skiff photom.html\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n3440 sec, post-trigger respectively) The event lists were further processed with the XRTDAS\n(v1.7.1; in FTOOLS) to produce the final cleaned event lists. In particular, the xrtpipeline\n(v0.9.9) applied calibration and standard filtering and screening criteria. Temporal intervals\nduring which the CCD temperature was higher than \u221247 \u25e6 C were cut out, and hot and\nflickering pixels were removed. An on-board event threshold of \u223c0.2 keV was also applied\nto the central pixel, to reduce most of the background due to either the bright Earth limb\nor the CCD dark current. The events selected for analysis had XRT grades 0\u201312 and 0\u20132 for\nPC and WT data, respectively (for the Swift XRT nomenclature, see Burrows et al. 2005).\nThe GRB 051109A WT data were extracted in a rectangular region 40 pixels long along\nthe image strip and 20 pixels wide. The afterglow was sufficiently intense to cause pile-up\nin the PC mode data until the third orbit. To account for this effect the source events were\nextracted in an annulus with a 20-pixel outer radius (\u223c 47\u2032\u2032 ) and a 3-pixel inner radius.\nThese radii were derived by comparing the observed and nominal PSF. For the PC data\ncollected after the third orbit, the entire circular region (20-pixel radius) was used, instead.\nThe selected extraction regions correspond to \u223c 93.5 % (WT), \u223c 47.4 % (piled-up PC), and\n\u223c 88.5 % (non piled-up PC) of the XRT PSF. These fractions were applied to correct the\nmeasurements to the full count rate. The background was measured from data within an\nannulus (radii 70 and 130 pixels) centered on the source (PC mode), and within a rectangular\nbox (40\u00d720 pixels) far from background sources (WT mode).\nSpectra of the source and background were extracted in the regions described in above\nfrom the first orbit event files. Ancillary response files were generated with the task xrtmkarf\nwithin FTOOLS, with RMF (v007) spectral redistribution matrices. The 0.5\u201310 keV WT\ndata and 0.2\u201310 keV PC data were simultaneously fit to an absorbed power law model, with\nGalactic NHGal = 1.75 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 , and a free NH parameter at the GRB redshift. A free\nconstant factor was introduced to take into account the decrease of the mean flux between\nWT and PC data. The result is a photon index \u0393 = 2.06 \u00b1 0.09 and a column density of\n21\nNH = 7.91+4.24\ncm\u22122 (90% errors for one interesting parameter). There is no evidence\n\u22123.68 \u00d7 10\nfor strong spectral changes after the first orbit. The GRB 051109A count rates were then\nconverted to 0.2\u201310 keV unabsorbed fluxes (presented in Table 3) using the best spectral fit.\nBAT data were used for \u03b3-ray comparisons in Swift bursts. For these, the event files\nfrom the public archives were analyzed with the BATTOOLS and XSPEC11 software packages4 . Using the appropriate housekeeping files, mask weighting was determined with\nbatmaskwtevt, then signal-to-noise binned lightcurves were made with batbinevt. Spectral response (.pha and .rsp) files were created for specific time intervals using batbinevt,\n4\n\nhttp://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/swift/analysis/\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nbatupdatephakw, batphasyserr and batdrmgen. XSPEC11 fit photon indices and returned\nunabsorbed flux values (15\u2013150 keV) from the .pha and .rsp files. The comparison of count\nrates and returned fluxes yields a general conversion factor that can be applied to transform\na count rate lightcurve to fluxes.\n\n4.\n\nResults\n\nFor these two bursts, there is a significant overlap between the early optical observations\nand much higher energy emission (X-ray or \u03b3-ray). Temporal and spectral comparisons\ncan elucidate whether the higher and lower energy emission come from the same spectral\ncomponent or emitters. GRB 051109A has good temporal overlap between the optical and\nX-ray observations. The GRB 051111 early optical lightcurve has significant overlap with\nthe \u03b3-ray lightcurve, allowing a comparison of the lightcurve evolution in both bands. This\nsection describes the conversions required for these comparisons from the photometry in\nTables 1 and 2, or Swift data.\nWe determine the onset of \u03b3-ray emission, referred to as tGRB , by examining the BAT\nlightcurves for these events. The adopted onset for GRB 051109A is UT 01:12:15.5. This is\ncompatible with the time of initial BAT detections reported by Fenimore et al. (2005). The\nadopted onset time for GRB 051111 is UT 05:59:39, congruent with the report of Suzaku's\ninitial \u03b3-ray detection time (Yamaoka et al. 2005).\n\n4.1.\n\nOptical Transformations to Flux Density\n\nIn the following, all comparisons from the optical to the higher frequencies use R band\noptical flux densities corrected for Galactic extinction unless explicitly indicated otherwise.\nAll magnitudes from Tables 1 and 2 are converted using the effective frequencies and zero\npoint fluxes of Bessell (1979). In particular, the R-equivalent values are converted as if they\nwere R. This includes the ROTSE CR and MDM rR magnitudes. These values are corrected\nfor extinction with the prescription of Schlegel et al. (1998). The resulting corrections are\n0.511 and 0.433 mags of Galactic extinction in the R band for GRB 051109A and GRB 051111\nrespectively. These corrections are applied to all R-equivalent (CR and rR ) observations.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n4.2.\n\nSummary of Key Optical Features\n\nFigure 1 gives the GRB 051109A optical lightcurve. The host flux is significant by 1\nMsec. Its value, 1.4 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcJy, is fit from the entire lightcurve and subtracted in the figure\nto show the afterglow evolution.\nAs the dataset combines CR and rR data, we allow for a color offset between them,\nwhich is evident during the significant overlap from \u223c 2\u201320 ksec post-onset. The term is a\nsimple multiplicative factor (1.5\u00d7, see Table 4) for the flux density, fitted with the optical\nlightcurve. It is applied to the MDM data as plotted in Figure 1. A color term of 1.5\u00d7 (0.4\nmag) is substantial. However, it ited r observations calibrated to R standards to unfiltered\ndata, effectively two different optical bands near R. The MDM data during the overlap hints\nat a shallower evolution than the ROTSE data, but separate fits show this is not a significant\nresult. The figure shows that with the color term, the two lightcurves are in agreement.\nThe first 5-second ROTSE data point for GRB 051109A is contemporaneous with \u03b3-ray\nemission. The optical afterglow of GRB 051109A follows a power law decline at this time,\nbehavior previously observed in GRB 050401 (Rykoff et al. 2005b). In this case, the early\noptical afterglow steepens between the early observations (until 10 ksec), and the next night.\nA double power law fit exhibits an initial decline of t\u22120.652\u00b10.008 until a time 52 \u00b19 ksec, when\nit transitions to t\u22121.5\u00b10.2 (see Table 4). This describes the data adequately, as seen in Fig.\n1, but has \u03c72 = 96 for 62 degrees of freedom (DOF). We note that the sparser data after 1\nday leaves the final decay less well-constrained. Without the final observation, there would\nbe no host constraint, and the lightcurve would appear to have a more shallow decay and\nan earlier optical break.\nFigure 2 shows the GRB 051111 optical lightcurve. The optical is well-described by\npower law evolution, with breaks. There are two breaks, from an initial decay to a slightly\nflatter evolution at about 2 minutes post-onset, and then to a steeper decay near 0.5 hr postonset. The latter break is discussed in \u00a7 6.4, while the former resembles an optical excess\nduring the \u03b3-ray emission, discussed in \u00a7 7.\nUsing least-squares fitting, the optical lightcurve is characterized by a triple power law\n(Table 4). Initially, it decays as t\u22120.88\u00b10.02 , then at t = 120 \u00b1 20 sec, it flattens slightly to\nt\u22120.74\u00b10.01 , and finally at 1100 \u00b1 90 sec, it steepens to t\u22121.17\u00b10.02 . This fit includes the final\nMDM R-band point with no color term relative to the ROTSE CR , but the results are not\naffected if the fit is performed without the MDM point. The overall decay does not change\nbetween 10 and 100 ksec post-burst (although there may be some fluctuation about the\npower law, see Butler et al. 2006).\nThe existence of the initial steeper decay and the first optical break is visible to the eye\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nand statistically well-established. The triple power law fit gives a \u03c72 of 78 for 83 DOF. A\ndouble power law can also be fit to the data, resulting in a single break at 1500 sec and a\n\u03c72 of 98 for 85 DOF. Both fits yield acceptable \u03c72 , but the double power law fit has larger\nsystematic residuals. An F -test indicates that the decrease in \u03c72 by allowing the early, third\npower law segment is statistically significant at a confidence level greater than 0.999.\nIn both Figures 1 and 2, the optical decay has begun a steady decline by the first observations. These two events are well-sampled examples where the optical decay is established\nin a form like the fireball model afterglow during the end of the prompt emission, only tens of\nseconds after the start of the GRB. This is in contrast to some other cases, where the optical\nis rising during (GRB 050820A, Vestrand et al. 2006) or after (GRB 060605, Schaefer et al.\n2006) the prompt emission.\n\n4.3.\n\nHigh-Energy Data Transformations to Flux Densities\n\nWe use the GRB 051109A XRT fluxes from Table 3. These de-absorbed X-ray fluxes are\nconverted to flux densities using the spectral fit. The spectrum's power law photon index\n(2.06 \u00b1 0.09) yields a weighted mean frequency of 5.7\u00d71017 Hz and a conversion factor of\n4.35 \u00d7 104 Jy per erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 (adding a further uncertainty of 5%) to convert to flux density.\nWe obtained the \u03b3-ray data for these events from the BAT observations in the Swift\npublic archive. These are reduced with the standard suite of BATTOOLS (see \u00a7 3) to produce\nspectral fits, count rates, and fluxes as needed.\nFor GRB 051109A, the BAT fluxes were analyzed by checking spectral fits over the entire\nburst (\u221210 to 50 sec post-onset), yielding \u0393 = 1.50 \u00b1 0.15. Analysis from \u221210 to 5 and 5\nto 50 sec showed consistent photon indices, so there is no evidence for spectral evolution\nthroughout this burst. Thus spectral parameters fitted from the entire burst were used to\nproduce fluxes and flux densities in the BAT band from count rates. This method was also\nused in analyzing other events, as described in \u00a7 7.1.\nFor GRB 051111, the BATTOOLS spectral fits show that the BAT spectral index softens\nfrom 1.22 \u00b1 0.04 (\u22125 to 10 sec) to 1.48 \u00b1 0.07 (10 to 100 sec). The times of interest all occur\nduring the later interval, and this interval's value of of \u0393 is used to convert from count rate\nto flux density.\nBAT and XRT fluxes were also compared (for GRB 051109A) using the BAT flux spectrally extrapolated to the XRT energy range. The best determination of the BAT spectrum\nis obtained via XSPEC11 fits to the entire data set. The BAT fit parameters allow a flux\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nextrapolation in XSPEC11 from the total BAT count rate to the flux in the XRT energy\nband. The extrapolation can be applied to each BAT data point in the count rate light\ncurve.\n\n4.4.\n\nSummary of Key High Frequency Features\n\nFigure 1 shows the GRB 051109A XRT lightcurve for this event. There is a data gap\nfrom 205 to 3400 sec, due to orbital constraints. We examined the data both by fitting\nbefore and after the gap independently, as well as fitting the entire dataset. All the results\nare presented in Table 4.\nThe first orbit data, from 134.0 to 204.5 sec post-onset, shows a steep decline as t\u22123.2\u00b10.4\nwhile during this stage the optical decays at a much slower rate. The later observations,\nfrom 3.4 to 1400 ksec, show the X-ray flux declining more shallowly.\nConsidered in isolation, the X-ray data after the first orbit shows similar behavior to the\noptical lightcurve, a double power law, but with a shallower break. Initially decaying \u223c t\u22121 ,\nat approximately 30 ksec, it would steepen to t\u22121.3 . The back-extrapolation of this fit is\nbrighter than the X-ray flux level at the end of the first orbit. This requires a near-\"plateau\"\nas the overall flux evolution throughout the data gap (an unseen fourth power law segment\nin the lightcurve).\nThe entire X-ray dataset can be fit by a triple power law: t\u22123.3 shallowing to t\u22120.6 at\n200 sec, then steepening to t\u22121.2 at 7 ksec. Due to data uncertainty, both fits, linked and\nunlinked across the data gap, are statistically good (\u03c72 reported in Table 4). The triple\npower law fit is driven by the data gap: the data at 6 ksec does not show an evident break,\nand fitting the data before and after the gap separately yields a fit at late times that best\nmatches (t\u22121.32 ) just the late time behavior. The fit residuals for the model over the entire\nXRT dataset appear to show trends near the 6 ksec break and the late-time decay, however\nthey are not statistically unreasonable using the \"runs test\" for the signs of residuals. The\ninterpretation of the data can accomodate significant variation in the break time (30 vs. 7\nksec) and final decay (t\u22121.3 vs. t\u22121.2 ).\nWe note that the early XRT decay differs from the behavior through the data gap.\nGRB 051109A XRT observations began after the end of \u03b3-ray emission. The prompt highenergy emission was spectrally extrapolated to the XRT band for comparison. Initally comparable in flux, the XRT decay is steeper than that implied from the flux extrapolations\nfrom the BAT during the period from \u223c1 sec to 1 minute from the GRB onset. This would\nbe consistent with the interpretation of steep X-ray emission from high-latitude photons, at\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nthe end of the GRB.\nFigure 3 shows the GRB 051111 BAT lightcurve. The BAT lightcurve from 15\u2013200 sec\npost-onset (a time range chosen for comparison with the optical lightcurve which begins\nat 31.9 sec) is fit as t\u22121.50\u00b10.07 (\u03c72 = 41 for 32 DOF). The temporal behavior is fit using\nthe count rate lightcurve, to avoid the additional uncertainty in the conversion from count\nrate to flux density. The count rate fit is normalized at 31.9 sec, with an amplitude that\ncorresponds to a flux density of 81.7 \u00b1 4.1 \u03bcJy at a weighted mean frequency of 1.7 \u00d7 1019Hz.\n\n5.\n\nFireball Model Features for Interpretation\n\nBoth GRB 051111 and GRB 051109A exhibit optical lightcurve breaks at early times.\nTo interpret these events, we use the simple fireball model (Meszaros & Rees 1997; Sari et al.\n1998). This section describes the model's predicted spectral and lightcurve evolution rate\ncharacteristics that are relevant for optical and higher-energy frequencies (Piran 2005, fully\nreviews the model). Later sections will demonstrate that the optical and X-ray lightcurve\nbreaks cannot be explained by the model predictions outlined below.\nThe fireball describes the emission from a population of accelerated electrons with\nLorentz factor distribution N(\u03b3e ) \u221d \u03b3e\u2212p . The afterglow spectrum has spectral breaks: principally \u03bdm , due to the mimimum Lorentz factor \u03b3e , and \u03bdc , the cooling frequency. There is\nalso a self-absorption frequency, but it is far below the optical when the optical transient\nflux is decaying.\nThe electron index p determines the synchrotron flux spectral shape. Each spectral\nregion has a spectral index \u03b2, with flux density f\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u03b2 . The index \u03b2 = (1 \u2212 p)/2 for\n\u03bdm < \u03bd < \u03bdc , and \u03b2 = \u2212p/2 for the case when \u03bd > \u03bdc and \u03bd > \u03bdm . (When \u03bdc < \u03bdm ,\nthe spectral shape is \u03bd \u22121/2 for frequencies between them.) The frequencies evolve in time\ndepending upon geometry and the circumburst density distribution n(r). The standard\nassumptions for the density are n constant (\"ISM\" case), or n \u221d r \u22122 (\"windlike\" case).\nEach spectral region (relative to the break frequencies) and density regime has a relation\nbetween the lightcurve temporal evolution and p, e.g., f\u03bd \u221d t3(1\u2212p)/4 for \u03bdm < \u03bd < \u03bdc in the\nISM case for spherical geometry. These relations require p > 2. Otherwise either the total\nenergy diverges or there is a high-energy cutoff that drives the flux evolution at a different\nrate.\nThe fireball model predicts lightcurve breaks due to both spectral evolution from the\ncooling adiabatic shock, and hydrodynamic transitions. While the fireball will produce rising\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nlightcurves at low frequencies (attenuating self-absorption, or the approach of the spectral\npeak), above the peak, the flux decays. The high-frequency lightcurves are expected to\nsteepen.\nSpectral evolution will produce chromatic breaks, with break frequencies evolving typically \u223c t\u22120.5 \u2013t\u22121.5 . The steepening follows a pattern, and is predicted to be shallow.\nThe cooling frequency, \u03bdc , is expected to produce a break. It evolves as t\u22121/2 for an\nISM density, and t1/2 for a windlike one. With an ISM density, the cooling frequency will\nstart high. As \u03bdc sweeps below a frequency, its lightcurve acquires a dependence upon \u03bdc and\nsteepens by \u2206\u03b1 = \u22120.25, so higher frequencies will have steeper decays. A windlike density\nfollows the opposite pattern, as \u03bdc sweeps up, making lightcurves shallower for frequencies\n\u03bd > \u03bdc . Lightcurves of frequencies \u03bdm < \u03bd < \u03bdc are steeper by \u2206\u03b1 = \u22120.25 than of\nfrequencies where \u03bdm < \u03bdc < \u03bd.\nThe passage of \u03bdm steepens a decaying lightcurve when \u03bdc < \u03bdm . When \u03bdc < \u03bd < \u03bdm ,\nthe lightcurve decays shallowly (with f\u03bd \u221d t\u22121/4 ) for both ISM and windlike cases. It then\nsteepens to the decay rate above \u03bdc and \u03bdm . This requires a very shallow initial decay. The\npassage of \u03bdc is the relevant case for changes in temporal evolution of lightcurves that decay\nfaster than t\u22121/4 .\nHydrodynamic changes can also provide lightcurve breaks. As the whole shock is affected, these breaks would be achromatic. The simple model predicts a \"jet break\" due to\nobserving the effects of collimated ejecta. A (sharp-edged) cone of ejecta initially evolves\nhydrodynamically as if it were isotropic. When the ejecta have slowed sufficiently for the\nemission's beaming angle to be larger than the ejecta's opening angle, there will be a break\ndue to the \"missing light\" compared to a spherical distribution of emitters. By geometric\narguments, this would require a steepening by \u2206\u03b1 = \u22120.75. At approximately this time,\nthe ejecta will begin expanding significantly sideways, putting more energy into expansion\nand further weakening the observed emission. The model expectation would be a larger\n\u2206\u03b1, leading to a final lightcurve decay of t\u2212p (again, for p > 2) at all frequencies above the\nspectral peak.\nIn the simple formulation, a chromatic break would be shallow and due to \u03bdc , while an\nachromatic break would be strong and due to the jet. As discussed below, the lightcurve\nbreaks in the GRB 051111 and GRB 051109A do not follow these predictions.\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\n6.\n\nEvidence for Long-Term Energy Injection in Optical and X-ray\n\nThe GRB 051109A optical and X-ray lightcurves overlap for several decades in time.\nAlthough the data gaps allow some ambiguity, under any interpretation, the comparison\nof optical and X-ray evolution requires processes beyond the simple self-similar adiabatic\nfireball model.\n\n6.1.\n\nThe First Hour: X-ray and Optical Behavior Compared\n\n\u00a74.4 discusses the ambiguous measurements of the early X-ray lightcurve evolution. The\ndata can be fit by the nearly-canonical triple power law shape, with the shallow segment\nduring the orbital data gap. A fit to the data after the gap yields a later, shallower break\n(see Table 4).\nAs discussed in \u00a75, the fireball model predicts a shallow chromatic break or a strong\nachomatic break. However, the two X-ray fits, when compared to the optical lightcurve,\nfollow neither pattern.\nFirst, if the X-ray afterglow follows the triple power law shape, there are similar strong\nsteepenings in the X-ray and optical bands hours after the GRB, but the X-ray break occurs before the optical one. This is not characteristic of a jet or any other hydrodynamic\ntransition.\nThe X-ray triple power law is suggested by the lightcurve morphology from early analysis of XRT afterglows (Nousek et al. 2006, with 27 events). However, some XRT lightcurves\ndo not follow that pattern; in 40 cases O'Brien et al. (2006) identify several without the\nshallow or \"hump\" phase. These include examples with a single power law from early times\nonwards, either very steep (e.g., GRB 050421), or less so (e.g., GRB 050721). There are also\ncases where flares obscure where a \"shallow\" lightcurve segment may be (e.g., GRB 050908).\nIf GRB 051109A's X-ray afterglow followed the steep\u2013shallow\u2013steep pattern, the data gap\nwould coincidentally include the entire shallow segment. There is no information to determine whether GRB 051109A's X-ray decayed shallowly (t\u22120.6 ) from 200 to 3400 sec, or had\na more complex lightcurve evolution.\nThe second possible interpretation treats the data before and after the data gap (0.2\u20133\nksec) separately. Hours after the burst, it yields a shallow break, at the same time as the\nshallow optical break (thus not following the simple fireball predictions). The X-ray fit after\nthe gap back-extrapolates to a flux brighter than observed at t \u2248 0.2 ksec. This requires\na more complex discontinuity in the X-ray evolution. The optical has well-sampled steady\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\ndecay during the X-ray's data gap, which makes the implied discontinuous X-ray evolution\ndifficult to explain in a broadband context.\nUnder this interpretation, during the data gap, the X-ray lightcurve must brighten\nrelative to its previous decay. This would be explained if the X-ray afterglow rose between\norbits. However, the afterglow peak is already below the optical. The optical flux decay\nduring the XRT data gap shows that \u03bdm < \u03bdOPT < \u03bdX , and the afterglow would already\nhave risen at X-ray frequencies.\nA flatter X-ray evolution before 3.4 ksec would be expected if \u03bdc dropped below the\nX-ray band at that time. A break passage coincident with the end of a data gap would be\nsurprising. This interpretation is also unlikely due to the lack of evidence for change in X-ray\nspectrum between the first orbit and the second; the spectral index steepens by 0.5 when \u03bdc\npasses.\nOne possibility is an unseen flare (at XRT frequencies, during the data gap) that does\nnot decline to the original underlying level (see rare examples in O'Brien et al. 2006, Fig.\n2). Such a flare would have to have no effect upon the optical evolution, steady during this\ntime. This would be surprising as the similar X-ray and optical decays appear to indicate a\ncommon emission source by the X-ray's second orbit. Any effect that boosts the flux level\nin the X-ray would be expected to have some effects in the optical. There is no physical\nparameter in the fireball model upon which the flux at high frequencies depends that the\nflux at lower frequencies (above the spectral peak) does not. Specifically, if energy is injected\nto raise the flux level, it will affect the entire spectrum.\nBy 40 sec post-onset, the optical remnant of GRB 051109A has begun a steady decline\nconsistent with the synchrotron model from an external shock (with the steady addition of\nenergy). The X-ray emission is not compatible with the afterglow until some time between\n0.2 and 3.4 ksec. The establishment of emission from the assumed self-similar forward shock\nappears more complex at high energies than at low ones.\n\n6.2.\n\nGRB 051109A: X-ray and Optical Breaks Near 0.5 Day\n\nThe optical lightcurve for GRB 051109A has a break approximately half a day after the\nburst. The XRT lightcurve steepens on a similar timescale.\nA lack of full coverage limits our knowledge of these breaks in both bands. The optical\nlightcurve has sparse coverage after about 20 ksec and has a strong host contribution by 1\nMsec. This prevents a precise measurement of the break time and post-break decay. The\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\noptical steepening may be significant, but at \u2206\u03b1OP T = \u22120.8 \u00b1 0.2 it is also consistent within\n3 \u03c3 of a shallow (\u2206\u03b1 = \u22120.25) cooling break. The XRT data gap (200\u20133400 sec) prevents a\ngood measurement of the segment before the break. The X-ray may transition from a quite\nshallow (t\u22120.6 ) decay around 2 hours, with \u2206\u03b1X = \u22120.64, or it may have an initially steeper\nevolution (t\u22121 ) with a break of \u2206\u03b1X = \u22120.28 near 9 hours. The shape of the afterglow\nlightcurves is more uncertain than the statistical error bars of model-fit decay rates and\ntransition times (Table 4).\nThere is a transition at both frequencies at a comparable time. If the steepening were\ndue to a break frequency passing from the X-ray to the optical, the break would have to\nevolve at least as fast as \u223c \u03bd \u221d t\u22123.5 (if the X-ray break is around 7 ksec), or even \u223c \u03bd \u221d t\u221217\n(if the X-ray break is at 34 ksec). This is faster than any break evolution expected in the\nfireball model. With the uncertainty in break times, the optical and X-ray lightcurves are\nconsistent with an achromatic break time. Due to the significant uncertainty in the optical\nsteepening \u2206\u03b1, the lightcurves are consistent with having the same amount of steepening\n\u2206\u03b1.\nUsing the fits from Table 4, we find the spectral index from the optical to the X-ray before\nand after the breaks near 0.5 days. The results are \u03b2OP T \u2212X = \u22120.65 \u00b1 0.15 (\u22120.8 \u00b1 0.2)\nat 6 (100) ksec. The consistency of \u03b2OP T \u2212X across the observed shallow breaks also points\nto the X-ray and optical breaks arising from a single cause, producing an achromatic effect\nupon the spectrum of a single emission source.\n\n6.2.1. Fireball Spectral Constraints\nThe position of spectral breaks relative to the observed frequencies can be constrained\nvia \u03b2 and \u03b1. Given the uncertainties in the optical and X-ray decay rates and lightcurve\nbreaks, more than one type of fireball model could explain the GRB 051109A afterglow data.\nAfter the breaks at \u223c 0.5 days, the optical apparently decays more quickly than the\nX-ray, at t\u22121.5\u00b10.2 . However, there is significant uncertainty in this decay rate; by refitting\nwith various fixed decay indices \u03b1, we find the optical decay may be as shallow as t\u22121.1 (3 \u03c3\nsignificance). This would be consistent with the X-ray decay being steeper than the optical\ndecay by \u2206\u03b1 \u2248 \u22120.25 before and after this break, if the X-ray was decaying as steeply as\nt\u22121 at t \u2248 3 ksec, after the data gap.\nAs \u03b2 = \u2212p/2 < \u22121 when \u03bd > \u03bdm , \u03bdc , the relatively shallow \u03b2OP T \u2212X \u2248 \u22120.7 points to\n\u03bdc > \u03bdOP T , with \u03bdc above or just below the X-ray. After the 0.5 day breaks, if the X-ray is\ndecaying as t\u22121.3 and the optical as t\u22121.1 , \u03bdc would be between the optical and X-ray and the\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\ncircumburst density would be constant, like the ISM (in the windlike case, higher \u03bd do not\ndecay more quickly than lower \u03bd). This would require an electron energy index p \u2248 2.4, and\npoint to the interpretation that the X-ray was decaying more quickly than the optical before\nthe 0.5 day break as well. Alternatively, if both the X-ray and optical are decaying \u223c t\u22121.3\nafter the break, the shallow \u03b2OP T \u2212X would indicate \u03bdm < \u03bdOP T < \u03bdX < \u03bdc , which would be\nsatisfied for a windlike medium with p \u2248 2.4 and for an ISM medium with p \u2248 2.7.\n\n6.3.\n\nDoes the Fireball Model Explain the Breaks Near 0.5 Day?\n\nThe GRB 051109A afterglow lightcurves have shapes somewhere between the two (Xray) cases inferred from the data. The ordinary fireball model does not easily explain either\nthe case of simultaneous optical and X-ray breaks (with a shallow \u2206\u03b1X ) or that of both\n\u2206\u03b1 \u2248 \u22120.7 (with the optical break later than the X-ray).\nIf the breaks occur at the same time, they do not resemble the expected achromatic\njet break steepening. The X-ray break appears far shallower (051109A XRT 2 in Table\n4 \u2206\u03b1 \u2248 \u22120.3) than the minimum \u2206\u03b1 = \u22120.75 for a non-spreading jet (\u00a75). Moreover,\nthe pre-break decays (GRB 051109A and XRT 2 in Table 4) are not well explained by the\nfireball model. As the X-ray decay is apparently steeper than the optical initially, the model\nindicated would be an ISM density with \u03bdm < \u03bdOP T < \u03bdc < \u03bdX . Then the quite shallow\noptical decay is difficult to interpret, as it indicates an electron energy index p = 1.87 \u00b1 0.01,\na value p < 2 resulting from relations that assume p > 2.\nThe alternate interpretation has an X-ray decay \u223c t\u22120.6 during the data gap, and the\nX-ray break before the optical break. The shallow early decay is still difficult to interpret.\nWhile the break amplitudes \u2206\u03b1 \u2248 \u22120.7 (both bands) could be interpreted as arising from\na non-expanding jet, the break times are not achromatic as expected. Interpreting the late\nX-ray decay as post-jet also calls into question all afterglow interpretations. Decays of t\u22121.3\nhave been routinely observed in afterglows on \u223c day timescales, and interpreted as spherical\nfireball behavior with typical electron energy indices p \u2248 2.4.\nPuzzling behavior has been observed in early broadband afterglow data. Some cases\nshow chromatic early lightcurve breaks, seen only in the X-ray while the optical decay\nrate remains constant (Panaitescu et al. 2006). Others show simultaneous optical and Xray breaks (e.g., GRB 050525A and GRB 050801, Blustin et al. 2006; Rykoff et al. 2006).\nThe GRB 050801 afterglow break was achromatic for optical and X-ray frequencies, but\ndid not have the characteristics of a jet break (Rykoff et al. 2006). The nearest analogy\nto GRB 051109A may be the GRB 050525A afterglow, which exhibited both optical and\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nX\u2013ray steepening at t \u2248 4 hours, with break amplitudes differing between the frequencies\n(Blustin et al. 2006). The final GRB 050525A lightcurve decays are quite steep (nearly \u223c\nt\u22122 ), and Blustin et al. (2006) tentatively conclude it is a jet break. Such a steep decay is\nnot observed in GRB 051109A.\n\n6.3.1. No Obvious Explanation by Complex n(r)\nUnder either lightcurve interpretation, a more complex environment cannot be easily\nused to produce the breaks. A change in density gradient would be a hydrodynamic change,\nand would produce an achromatic effect. The effect would be tiny for frequencies above both\n\u03bdc and \u03bdm . An achromatic break time appears to require an X-ray decay initially steeper\nthan optical, so \u03bdc would be between the frequencies, and only a transition in the optical\nwould be expected. Disregarding the break times, it is quite difficult to produce a transition\nfrom t\u22120.65 to t\u22121.2 . If the latter is an ISM model fireball observed between \u03bdm and \u03bdc , it\nimplies p \u2248 2.7. Such a steep energy index would not produce a shallow t\u22120.65 decay even\nwith a sharply rising density gradient (see Yost et al. 2003, Table 5).\nAn alternative environmental effect such as variable extinction would have to affect\nfrequencies from optical to the X-ray in the same fashion, which is not reasonable for known\nabsorbers. Thus, environmental changes do not provide a plausible solution.\n\n6.3.2. No Obvious Explanation by Changing Burst Parameters\nWe checked whether changing the physical parameters of the fireball could readily explain the observed lightcurves. Beyond the general question of early energy injection, recent\nanalyses of early chromatic break cases have opened the question of changing microphysical\nparameters (Panaitescu et al. 2006).\nAs mentioned above (\u00a7 6.3), a shallow t\u22120.65 decay could imply a hard p < 2. A steepening of p would conceivably produce the lightcurve breaks (particularly if both bands were\nindeed shallow early on, with the same transition to a final decay rate). This possibility still\npresents a difficulty, as the spectral index would also steepen. For a sufficiently significant\nsteepening of p, \u2206\u03b2OP T \u2212X \u223c \u22120.5, and the ratio of X-ray to optical flux would drop by more\nthan a factor of 10 during the transition at t > 20 ksec. This is not observed (Fig. 1).\nIt is also difficult to produce the lightcurve breaks by changing the electron or magnetic energy fractions, \u01ebe or \u01ebB . Even a shallow lightcurve break would require significant\nparameter changes (see the spectrum's dependences upon physical parameters, summarized\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nby Piran 2005). We note that generic microphysical parameter changes have many degrees\nof freedom, if \u01ebe , \u01ebB , and p can vary independently. As such, this is a poorly-constrained\nhypothesis for the various \"flattened\" early decays in GRB afterglows.\nA more physically-motivated parameter change is the continuous injection of energy\ninto the forward shock. Such a change would in general slow the lightcurve decay, causing\na break when the injection ends. This simple formulation would not be able to explain a\nsteepening in the X-ray before the optical, and the GRB 051109A afterglow lightcurves do\nnot definitely have an achromatic break. However, the similar timescales for the steepening\nof optical and X-ray lightcurves suggest such a common cause.\nIncreased energy could be provided in a burst when the engine emits a distribution of\nmaterial with Lorentz factors distributed in a power law (M(\u03b3) \u221d \u03b3 \u2212S , e.g., Sari & M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros\n2000). The gradual \"catching up\" of material to the slowing forward shock increases the\nshock energy and decreases the flux decay rate. This model affects both spectral regions\nabove the peak (above and below \u03bdc ), giving them a comparable amount of flattening. This\nexplanation can provide the appropriate level of pre-break flattening for GRB 051109A, both\nat optical and X-ray, with an influx of material with Lorentz factors distributed as M(\u03b3) \u223c\n\u03b3 \u22124 .\n\n6.4.\n\nGRB 051111 Optical Break at 0.5 hours: Similarity to GRB 051109A\n\nThe optical afterglow of GRB 051111 shows a break at 1200 sec with amplitude similar to\nthe GRB 051109A break (Table 4). Its amplitude, \u2206\u03b1 = \u22120.43 \u00b1 0.03, is too large to be due\nto the passage of the spectrum's cooling break. It is also too shallow to be interpreted as a jet\nbreak. There is no overlapping X-ray data for comparison, but it shares the characteristics\nthat make the GRB 051109A afterglow break incompatible with the simple fireball model.\nThe decay post-break is consistent with several simple fireball scenarios. For GRB 051111\nat t > 1200 sec, the decay can be fit by an ISM or windlike medium, with the optical above\nthe peak and the cooling frequency of the synchrotron spectrum. The decay is also consistent\nwith the optical above the spectral peak but below the cooling frequency, although in the\nwindlike case the decay rate would imply a hard electron energy distribution, with p \u2248 2.\nThe RUCCD data (Table 2) give rough V RI information at 1 hour post-burst. We\nused the data to constrain the optical spectral slope at this time. The values were corrected\nby 0.537, 0.433, 0.314 magnitudes for Galactic extinction in V , R, and I respectively. The\ndata did not have the precision required to determine the spectral shape, but a fit to a\npower law for the three points yields a \u03b2OP T of \u22120.4 \u00b1 1.0. This result is consistent with all\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\nspectral scenarios for the density regimes discussed above. It slightly favors the cases where\nthe optical band is still below the cooling frequency at this time, which give harder optical\nspectra.\nThe decay pre-break is difficult to reconcile with the standard fireball model expectations. Using the p > 2 relations for this shallow decay results in an inconsistent value of\np < 2 for a windlike medium in any spectral ordering, or for an ISM medium above the cooling frequency. The ISM medium model, with the optical between the peak and \u03bdc , would\nbe just consistent with p = 2. As the ISM model finds p significantly above 2 post-break, it\nleaves the break unexplained.\n\n6.5.\n\nBreaks From Halting Energy Injection?\n\nThe afterglow of GRB 051109A has a break observed at optical and X-ray frequencies\nat a similar time, tens of ksec post-burst. Data sampling gaps do not permit a definite\ndetermination of whether the break was achromatic, yet even a near proximity in time\nsuggests a common cause. Geometric and environmental characteristics do not provide\na plausible explanation, but the end of a stage of smooth energy injection could steepen\nlightcurves as observed.\nThe GRB 051111 break may be due to similar causes as the GRB051109A afterglow\nbreak. As in the GRB 051109A case, the GRB 051111 optical afterglow's shallow decay also\nlasts substantially longer than the prompt \u03b3-ray detections (until 1200 sec cf. 80 sec). The\nGRB 051111 break can also be explained by continued energy injection from the GRB time\nuntil the break time.\n\n7.\n\nGRB 051111: A Prompt Optical Component Consistent with the extension\nof the \u03b3-rays\n\nWe now discuss the high-energy comparison for the early GRB 051111 optical observations. There is no early X-ray temporal overlap, but a significant overlap with \u03b3-ray\nobservations. The \"90% fluence duration\" of the burst is T90 = 47 \u00b1 1 sec in the 15\u2013350 kev\nband (Krimm et al. 2005a), and the flux has a smooth decay from 10 sec after the onset that\nextends to 80 sec post-trigger (see Figure 3). From the onset tGRB (05:59:39, see \u00a74), three\noptical points are contained within T90 , and seven are at t \u2212 tGRB < 80 sec. We can compare\nnot just a single point to the \u03b3-ray emission, but rather the optical evolution to the \u03b3-ray\nevolution, as fitted from their lightcurves.\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\nThe optical lightcurve at t < 125 sec is brighter than the extrapolation of the \u223c125\u20131000\nsec data to earlier times. The decay before 125 sec is steeper than afterwards, which suggests\nan \"excess component\" during the GRB emission. The \"excess\" would be the difference\nbetween the observed emission and the extrapolation of the later, shallower emission to this\nearly time. Taking the difference between the data and the back-extrapolation of the power\nlaw which dominates from \u2248 0.1\u20131 ksec gives an estimate of the excess component. The\ndifference is well-fit by a power law decay of t\u22121.8\u00b10.4 .\nThe implied t\u22121.8 decay rate of the excess could be expected for a reverse shock component (Sari & Piran 1999), but it would be a surprising coincidence for an excess to arise\nfrom a reverse shock component lasting precisely the GRB timescale. The GRB decline is\n\u03b1\u03b3 = \u22121.50\u00b10.07 (\u00a7 4.4), so it is possible that the excess is correlated with the GRB emission\n(as in the case of GRB 041219A, Vestrand et al. 2005). As the GRB has a single peak with a\nsmooth tail during the optical observations, it is not possible to establish a correlation from\nlightcurve morphology.\nAs discussed in \u00a7 4.2, the data permit a fit by a double power law with a single break at\nt \u223c 1 ksec, which would imply no early excess. The triple power law from which we infer an\nexcess is visible and statistically established by the fit improvement. Yet due to the data's\nuncertainties, a fit to a double power law plus an excess power law component will find\nan acceptable fit with no early excess component. The properties of the excess component\ncannot be constrained with such a general fit model.\nAs the above estimate of the early optical excess is consistent with the \u03b3-ray lightcurve\ndecay, we attempt to refine the component's estimation under the assumption that its decay\nis linked to the contemporaneous \u03b3-ray lightcurve. We consider the optical flux density\ndata for t < 1 ksec and the \u03b3-ray count rates from 15\u2013150 sec. This dataset was fit to a\nfunction At\u03b11 + Bt\u03b12 (optical) and Ct\u03b11 (\u03b3-rays). A Monte Carlo method determined the fit\nparameter uncertainties. Artificial datasets were generated, using the measured values and\nuncertainties to form Gaussian distributions for each data point, and then fit, yielding the\ndistributions of the function's parameters.\nWith 2000 trials, \u03b11 = \u22121.44 \u00b1 0.07 and \u03b12 = \u22120.70 \u00b1 0.03. These are consistent with\nthe previous measurement of this phase's \u03b3-ray decay and \u03b12 in the triple power law fit\n(Table 4) respectively. The estimated optical excess at 31.9 sec (A) is 8.2 \u00b1 2.1 mJy. The\ndistribution for A is nearly Gaussian, and A > 0 is significant at above the 3 \u03c3 level. This\nestimation of the optical excess agrees with the \"implied excess\" from the triple power law\nfit at the 1.5 \u03c3 level.\nWe compare both the total optical flux and the estimated excess optical flux to the \u03b3-ray\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\nspectral extrapolation. The total optical flux density at the early time is a good match for a\nsimple extension of the \u03b3-ray power law spectrum. We determine \u03b2OP T \u2212\u03b3 = \u22120.554 \u00b1 0.005\nat 31.9 sec, while \u03b2\u03b3 = \u22120.48 \u00b1 0.07. These are compatible; the optical flux at this time\ncould be produced by the low-frequency tail of the GRB. Two elements argue against this\ninterpretation. First, it would require a sudden change from optical flux entirely due to\nthe GRB component during the first exposure, to a similar optical flux entirely due to the\nafterglow seconds later. This is not a reasonable model. Secondly, the total optical decay\nrate is significantly shallower than the \u03b3-ray decay as discussed above. Thus we compare\nthe flux densities of the optical excess and the \u03b3-rays and find the spectral index between\nthem, \u03b2 = \u22120.44 \u00b1 0.03, is also compatible with \u03b2\u03b3 . The optical excess, considering both\nits temporal decay (\u03b1) and its flux level, could be produced by a spectrally unbroken lowfrequency extension of the GRB. This is demonstrated in Fig. 4, which compares uncertainty\ncontours for flux densities and \u03b1.\nIn conclusion, the prompt optical data of GRB 051111 has an excess over later optical\nevolution. The \"excess\" optical flux is consistent with an extra component from the GRB\nemission. In this case, the optical emission from the \"GRB proper\" is a simple extension\nof the GRB spectrum from the BAT band of 15\u2013150 keV, and the spectral index from the\noptical excess to the \u03b3-rays is consistent with the spectral index within the \u03b3-ray band. This\nis unexpected, as there must eventually be a GRB spectral rollover at low frequencies.\n\n7.1.\n\nComparison of Prompt Detections\n\nThere have now been several cases with optical emission detected contemporaneously\nwith the \u03b3-rays: GRB 990123, GRB 041219A, GRB 050319 (see Appendix A), GRB 050401,\nand GRB 050904, along with GRB 051111 (discussed above) and GRB 051109A (as mentioned in \u00a7 4.1, the first ROTSE point overlaps with the tail end of GRB emission). There\nis no single behavior among this group, spectrally or in lightcurve evolution.\nThe prompt optical emission of GRB 990123 had an optical excess above later afterglow\nevolution that was not correlated with the GRB peaks (Akerlof et al. 1999), GRB 041219A\nhad optical emission correlated with the GRB evolution (Vestrand et al. 2005; Blake et al.\n2005), and GRB 050401 had no detectable excess prompt optical emission (Rykoff et al.\n2005b). GRB 050319 is similar to GRB 050401 in that the prompt optical detection (1st\npoint) does not deviate from the lightcurve (see Quimby et al. 2006). Bo\u00ebr et al. (2006)\ndiscuss optical emission during the very long, high-redshift GRB 050904. They detect optical\nflaring contemporaneously with X-ray flaring, at the end of \u03b3-ray emission, but do not discuss\nthe optical comparison to the \u03b3-rays.\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\nThe optical-to-\u03b3 spectral indices, \u03b2OP T \u2212\u03b3 , and \u03b3-ray band spectral indices, \u03b2\u03b3 , are\nsummarized in Table 5 and plotted in Figure 5. Appendix A describes the sources of this\ninformation. The indices are compared to see if any other events could have prompt optical\nemission as an unbroken spectral extension of the \u03b3-rays. In addition to GRB 051111, the\nGRB 050904 event is a good candidate for such a component. There are other possible\nexamples, but the spectral constraints are considerably poorer. GRB 051109A is compatible\nwith a prompt optical extension, but the spectrum in the \u03b3-rays has significant uncertainty.\nThe first time interval considered for the broadband comparison in GRB 041219A may be\ncompatible; the \u03b3-ray spectral shape at the low end of the \u03b3-ray band is poorly constrained.\nGRB 050904 was a very long (in our reference frame) high-z GRB. The TAROT observations of Bo\u00ebr et al. (2006) have an initial upper limit, two constant detections, a flare, then\nupper limits. Only the first two optical observations, up to 254 sec, have significant BAT\nflux (the 90% flux duration is 225 \u00b1 10 sec, Sakamoto et al. 2005a). The second observation\n(the first optical detection) is used to get \u03b2OP T \u2212\u03b3 . This spectral index is compatible with\nan extension of the BAT photon index (measured during the optical observation from 169\nto 254 sec post-onset). However, the BAT flux fades away by the next optical observation,\nand the Bo\u00ebr et al. (2006) optical flux does not. The two components may not be from the\nsame emission source.\nThus GRB 051111 may be unusual, with a prompt optical component compatible with\nthe interpretation of a simple spectral extrapolation from the \u03b3-rays. There are several\ncases of prompt optical observations, and no dominant behavior in the relative optical/\u03b3\ncomparisons.\nBeyond the extrapolation of \u03b2\u03b3 to the optical, the comparison of \u03b2OP T \u2212\u03b3 and \u03b2\u03b3 are not\nalways compatible with a single prompt synchrotron spectrum. In the case of GRB 990123,\nthe prompt optical flux is well above the \u03b3-ray spectral extrapolation and \u03b2OP T \u2212\u03b3 is much\nsofter than \u03b2\u03b3 . Connecting them requires a \"valley\" not seen in the synchrotron spectrum.\nThis may also be the case for GRB 051109A, although the uncertainties in the indices are\ntoo great to make this determination. In contrast, the GRB 041219A, GRB 050319, and\nGRB 050401 optical flux is well below the \u03b3-ray spectral extrapolation. These cases would be\ncompatible with a synchrotron spectrum having its flux density peak between the optical and\n\u03b3-ray frequencies. GRB 041219A (with an optical/\u03b3 lightcurve correlation, Vestrand et al.\n2005) would imply a prompt p \u2248 2\u20132.7 for \u03b2\u03b3 = (1 \u2212 p)/2 (or \u2212p/2 for the last time interval\ntabled). For the cases of GRB 050319 and GRB 050401, there is no lightcurve correlation\nand \u03b2OP T \u2212\u03b3 with \u03b2\u03b3 would imply a synchrotron peak at \u2248 0.5, 3 keV, respectively.\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\n7.2.\n\nImplications\n\nThe GRB 051109A and GRB 051111 events continue to confirm what has been previously\nnoted in prompt comparisons: that there can often be a prompt optical afterglow component\ndistinct from the low-energy emission tail of the GRB. In both cases, the prompt optical\nemission smoothly connects to the later afterglow (albeit with an excess component for\nGRB 051111). In the context of the fireball model, this would appear to indicate that the\ndeceleration and thus the establishment of the external shock occurs earlier than the end of\nhigh-energy emission. A separate afterglow component distinct from the prompt emission is\nalso implied by the likely interpretation of Nousek et al. (2006)'s standard XRT afterglow\nshape. The initial fast decline may be high-latitude emission from the end of the prompt\nGRB emission component, superimposed on the shallower, distinct afterglow component.\nThe existence of separate prompt and afterglow components is relevant to the question\nof GRB emission models. The \"external\u2013external\" shock model (Meszaros & Rees 1993)\nposits that the GRB's \u03b3-ray emission is produced by the fireball's external shock, and not\nby other means, such as internal shocks within the relativistic flow. GRB variability would\nbe due to interactions with a clumpy external medium. This model has been proposed as an\nexplanation for GRBs with a small number of \u03b3-ray lightcurve peaks, such as GRB 991216\n(Ruffini et al. 2002), and GRB 970508 (one of 10 GRBs with simple lightcurves analyzed by\nMcMahon et al. 2004). McMahon et al. (2004) examined the afterglow fits and extrapolated\nthe results to fluxes at the prompt GRB band. With a single external shock, the afterglow\nwould connect directly to the GRB. Despite GRB 051111's simple BAT lightcurve (see Fig. 3),\nit does not fit the external\u2013external picture. It has two components during the GRB \u2013 a\nprompt optical excess and the already-established afterglow. Its optical decay changes after\nthe end of GRB emission and does not extend from the \"excess\" component apparently\nconnected to the \u03b3-ray emission.\n\n8.\n\nConclusions\n\nGRB 051109A and GRB 051111 are two of the best-sampled cases to analyze broadband\ncomparisons of the prompt and very early post-burst optical lightcurves to higher energy\nemission. The results continue to show that there are diverse processes occurring during the\nearly afterglow phase.\nGRB 051109A has a break in both the optical and the X-ray near 0.5 day post-burst.\nIt is consistent with being an achromatic transition, although the X-ray data sampling does\nnot permit this to be firmly established. The breaks are shallower than expected for a jet\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\nbreak, and are most easily explained by the cessation of steady energy injection into the\nafterglow forward shock. The initial establishment of the afterglow may be more complex\nat high energies (X-ray) than at low ones (optical).\nGRB 051111's optical lightcurve decays more steeply during the prompt emission than\nafter the end of \u03b3-ray detection. This indicates a prompt excess above the continuing afterglow emission. Given the temporal coincidence of the excess with the GRB emission, and its\nflux level compatible with a spectral extrapolation of the \u03b3-ray flux, we interpret the excess\nas emission connected to the GRB. We do not consider a reverse shock interpretation as\nlikely. A separate component for prompt emission, disconnected with the ongoing afterglow\nemission, is not compatible with the external\u2013external shock model for this single-peaked\n\u03b3-ray event.\nIn comparison to other prompt detections, the GRB 051111 optical component is unusual. The GRB 051109A event may show optical flux at a level compatible with a direct\nextrapolation of the \u03b3-ray flux, but it is not as well constrained. In the GRB 041219A event,\nwith an optical lightcurve correlated with the GRB emission (Vestrand et al. 2005), the flux\nlevel cannot be simply extrapolated. A spectral break is implied between the optical and\n\u03b3-ray frequencies.\nIn both GRB 051109A and GRB 051111, the afterglow emission is ongoing during the\nprompt \u03b3-ray emission. In these cases the deceleration time to establish the external shock\nexpected to power the afterglow is shorter than the GRB duration. This is in contrast to other\ncases where the afterglow is rising throughout or after the prompt emission (GRB 050820A,\nGRB060605, Vestrand et al. 2006; Schaefer et al. 2006, respectively). There are a variety\nof apparent afterglow rise times, thus models of the GRB event and progenitor environment\nmust be capable to explaining such diverse results.\nAt tens of seconds after the GRB onset, the emitters are ultrarelativistic and near the\nprogenitor environment (\u223c light-week). GRB studies continue to uncover evidence of a wide\nvariety of processes underlying the emission during this early phase. There is optical emission of the \"afterglow\" type during the burst in both cases presented here. With present\ncapabilities it may only be rarely possible to observe the \"afterglow onset\" (rise of the forward shock) if it is usually well-established during the GRB itself. The dearth of reverse\nshock signatures and evidence of steady energy input for up to hours post-burst are clues to\ndynamic processes at the heart of the collapse of massive stars. We are learning that simple\ncalculations are insufficient to address such data. It is difficult to disentangle all source and\nenvironmental effects in order to study the ultrarelativistic emission. The most promising\navenue of study uses prompt and early simultaneous observations at widely separated frequencies. This coverage shows evidence that in some events, such as GRB 051109A, different\n\n\f\u2013 29 \u2013\nfrequencies resolve themselves to the steady afterglow flux declines over different timescales.\nSuch observations may shed light on the early emission.\nROTSE-III has been supported by NASA grant NNG-04WC41G, NSF grant AST0407061, the Australian Research Council, the University of New South Wales, the University\nof Texas, and the University of Michigan.

Thus to derive\nTable 5, for each event we revisit the determination of the spectral index within the \u03b3-ray\nband, as well as between the optical and \u03b3-rays.\nThe table gives the available simultaneous optical and \u03b3-ray detections for bursts to\ndate. The comparisons are based on spectral flux density, so both optical magnitudes and\n\n\f\u2013 30 \u2013\n\u03b3-ray fluxes are converted to flux density at a particular frequency. The table highlights\nwhether the optical flux is above or below the spectrum extrapolated from the \u03b3-ray band\nby comparing \u03b2OP T \u2212\u03b3 to \u03b2\u03b3 . As such, the \u03b3-ray frequency and spectral shape (\u03b2\u03b3 ) are for\nthe lowest well-measured \u03b3-ray energy. In most cases, it is simply the weighted average\nfrequency across the energy band, given the \u03b3-ray spectral index. When possible, the optical\nto \u03b3-ray comparisons are made for more than one time interval during the prompt overlap.\nThe following are details concerning each burst individually.\nFor GRB 990123, the data are from Akerlof et al. (1999), Table 1 and Briggs et al.\n(1999), Table 2. The optical-to-\u03b3 ratios of Briggs et al. (1999) are adjusted to correspond\nto the final optical values of Akerlof et al. (1999) (corrected for 0.05 mags of extinction),\nrather than the GCN preliminary values. These subsequently are used to produce \u03b2OP T \u2212\u03b3 .\nNo uncertainties were provided for the \u03b3-ray flux densities, so Table 5 reports 3 significant\nfigures, as in the source paper. The value of \u03b2\u03b3 is taken from the Band model fits of\nBriggs et al. (1999) for the entire event.\nFor GRB 041219A, the data are from Vestrand et al. (2005) (using its Fig. 4), which\ncorrects the optical flux for 4.9 mags of extinction. The \u03b3-ray frequency used, \u03bd\u03b3 , is for\nthe lowest energy of the four \u03b3-ray bins. \u03b2\u03b3 is fit for each time interval using the four \u03b3-ray\nfrequencies and flux densities. The first time interval has a \u03b3-ray spectrum that is not well-fit\nby a single spectral index (\u03c72 = 13 for 2 degrees of freedom). It has two entries in Table 5.\nThe first entry (Table 5, line 4) uses the overall least-squares fit \u03b2\u03b3 for this time interval,\ndespite the poor fit. The second entry (Table 5, line 5) uses \u03b2\u03b3 from the two lowest-energy\n\u03b3-ray frequency bins, which has a high uncertainty. The fourth time interval (Table 5, line\n8) has only upper limits for the flux densities in the optical and the highest-energy \u03b3 ray\nfrequency bin. The spectral index \u03b2\u03b3 is fit from only the first 3 frequency bins.\nThe GRB 050319 optical point is from Quimby et al. (2006), corrected for 0.03 mags\nof extinction (Schlegel et al. 1998). The \u03b3-ray data are from the Swift archive, analyzed\nwith BATTOOLS to produce a flux density and \u03b2\u03b3 . This burst had more than one peak of\nemission, and the soft \u03b3-ray spectral index quoted is derived from the final peak, from 130\u2013\n170 sec post-onset. The optical observations were taken after the end of the initially reported\n\u03b3-ray duration (Krimm et al. 2005b). However, high-energy emission was still detected in\nthe count rate lightcurve. The faint emission did not have high signal to noise during\nthe 5-sec optical observation. The \u03b3-ray flux at the optical detection time was estimated\nby interpolating a power law from the nearest 3 count rate data points. The result was\nconsistent with the power law interpolation of the nearest 4 \u03b3-ray detections in the tail of\nthe \u03b3-ray peak, as well as with linear interpolations using these 3 or 4 points. The signal-tonoise on the \u03b3-ray count rate detection is approximately 7; the low apparent signal-to-noise\n\n\f\u2013 31 \u2013\nof the flux density reported is due to uncertainty in the count rate conversion to flux density.\nThe GRB 050401 data is from Rykoff et al. (2005b). The photon index is converted to\n\u03b2\u03b3 . The optical flux density from Rykoff et al. (2005b), Table 1 is corrected for 0.174 mags\nof extinction as per Schlegel et al. (1998) at the coordinates given in the paper. The \u03b3-ray\nflux density uses the complete 15\u2013350 keV band, converting to a flux density at 140 keV\nusing \u03b2\u03b3 .\nThe GRB 050904 optical data is from Bo\u00ebr et al. (2006), corrected for 0.117 mags of\nextinction (at the OT coordinates, as per Schlegel et al. 1998) and converted to mJy. \u03b3-ray\ndata was taken from the Swift archive for this event. We used the standard BATTOOLS\npresciption to determine F\u03bd and \u03b2\u03b3 . We separated the data into two response files (during\nand post-slew for this interval), and combined them in XSPEC. As there is sufficient signal\nfor a good spectral extraction over the optical overlap tstart \u2013tend , \u03b2\u03b3 is from this time interval\nonly. The asymmetric error bars are a result of this extraction. The uncertainty in \u03b2OP T \u2212\u03b3\ncompares the maximum optical and minimum \u03b3-ray (and vice-versa) to calculate the range\nof \u03b2. The optical overlap analyzed here is the second interval (T2) of the Bo\u00ebr et al. (2006)\nobservations. However, the first interval had only an optical limit. The third interval had a\nsimilar optical flux to T2, but the \u03b3-ray flux is almost undetectable, as the GRB T90 duration\nis 225 \u00b1 10 sec (Sakamoto et al. 2005a). Therefore other optical comparisons were not well\nconstrained. The evolution of this event is further discussed in \u00a7 7.1.\nThe GRB 051109A optical data is taken from Table 1, with an extinction correction of\n0.511 mags (see \u00a7 4.1). The \u03b3-ray data are from the Swift archive, analyzed with BATTOOLS\nto produce a flux density and \u03b2\u03b3 . The spectral index \u03b2\u03b3 is for the entire burst duration;\nthere is no evidence of spectral evolution when the \u03b3-ray data is divided into two time bins.\nThe symmetric F\u03bd (\u03bd\u03b3 ) error bars are statistical; the asymmetric ones are the additional uncertainty in the conversion of count rate to flux. Similarly, the index \u03b2OP T \u2212\u03b3 has asymmetric\nerror bars from the count rate conversion uncertainty in the \u03b3-ray flux density.\nFor GRB 051111, the optical data is from Table 1, de-extincted by 0.433 mags (see\n\u00a7 4.1). The \u03b3-ray data are from the Swift archive, as detailed in \u00a7 3. In brief, standard\nBATTOOLS and XSPEC11 analysis were employed to extract spectral information for the\nevent as a whole, as well as the early (\u22125 to 10 sec) and late (10 to 50 sec) parts of the burst\n(roughly divided to halve the signal). The burst softened from early to late; the photon\nindex of the late part of the burst was used to produce the comparison \u03b2\u03b3 . The optical and\n\u03b3-ray flux densities are compared in two different ways at the midpoint of the first optical\npoint (31.9 sec). The \u03b3-ray flux density is derived from a fit to the BAT lightcurve for\nt > 15 sec, which is well-fit by a power law t\u22121.50\u00b10.07 . The first optical flux comparison is\nto the initial optical detection. The second is to the \"excess\" optical flux above the later,\n\n\f\u2013 32 \u2013\nshallower optical decay after the end of the GRB. While it is nominally at 31.9 sec, the optical\nexcess is derived from the lightcurve evolution. Line 13 uses the actual optical observation\nfrom Table 1, de-extincted. Line 14 uses the estimated \"optical excess\" from \u00a7 7 to make the\n\u03b2OP T \u2212\u03b3 comparison.\n\nREFERENCES\nAkerlof, C., et al. 1999, Nature, 398, 400\nAkerlof, C. W., et al.

A constant is added to the double power law fit model. The fitted host level is\n1.40 \u00b1 0.21 \u03bcJy, within 2.5\u03c3 of the measured host flux (corrected for extinction and the MDM color term). The MDM color term fit is dominated by the data during\nthe MDM/ROTSE overlap, the rR observations. A fit in which only rR data get a color term (the last 2 MDM points left with no color term) does not affect the\nresults.\ne The XRT observations are divided into the first orbit (XRT 1) and all subsequent data (XRT 2). As seen in Fig. 1, there is a data gap and the early and late\nevolution do not match.

The last two events\nare detailed in \u00a7 4. Appendix A gives data references and analysis, explaining individual lines event-by-event, with data references. The energy\nband for the BAT is 15\u2013150 keV, and a typical \u03b3-ray detection energy for a Swift event is \u223c100 keV. However, lower energy \u03b3-ray fluxes are\nused when a good measurement is available in order to compare the low-energy \u03b3-ray extension. When a \u03b3-ray flux density is reported with\nuncertainties larger than 1/3 of the flux value, the detection of high-energy emission in the count rate is greater than 3 \u03c3 significant. The\ntime ranges for determining the GRB photon index \u0393 typically extend over the entire burst time to get a good measurement, but can be for\nsubintervals as indicated in the Appendix. The optical bands are \"clear\" (no filter) tied to a filter band, V , R, I as indicated in the subscript.\nParticularly, the Appendix explains the two lines used for GRB 041219A's first time interval (with two estimates of \u03b2\u03b3 , and the two lines used\nfor GRB 051111 (with two optical flux estimates).\n\n\f\u2013 44 \u2013\n\nFig. 1.- GRB 051109A optical and X-ray early lightcurves. The ROTSE magnitudes and\nMDM of Table 1 are converted to flux densities (and corrected for by 0.511 mag of Galactic\nextinction, see \u00a7 4.1), and the XRT flux density conversions are described in \u00a7 4.3. The\nadopted onset time tGRB is UT 01:12:15.5. The optical lightcurve is fit by a double power\nlaw (see Table 4) from t\u22120.65 to t\u22121.5 with a break time of 50 \u00b1 10 ksec, plus a constant\nhost term. The fit includes a color term between the MDM R-equivalent r and the ROTSE\nR-equivalent unfiltered values, thus the MDM points are multiplied by the fitted factor of\n1.51 on the plot. The fitted host value of 1.4 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcJy is subtracted from the optical\nlightcurve (and the final point is not plotted), in order to show the evolution of the optical\nafterglow light. The first XRT orbit shows a steep decay discontinuous with subsequent Xray evolution. The later XRT data can be fit by a double power law (dotted lines showing the\nunlinked fits of data before and after the orbital gap), or by a triple power law (dashed line,\nwhere the shallow segment of t\u22120.6 has no data to anchor it). The latter approach shows the\naverage flux evolution through the data gap. The X-ray and the optical data, taken together,\nshow an steepening consistent with achromaticity around 0.5 days (see \u00a7 6.2). Post-break,\nthe decays and spectral index can be explained by an ISM or windlike model with the\ncooling break above the X-ray (\u00a7 6.2.1). Pre-break, the temporal decays are too shallow to\nbe easily explained by the fireball model, although long-duration smooth energy injection is\na possibility, see \u00a7 6.3.\n\n\f\u2013 45 \u2013\n\nFig. 2.- GRB 051111 optical ROTSE lightcurve. The ROTSE magnitudes of Table 2 are\nconverted to flux densities (corrected for 0.433 mag of Galactic extinction, see \u00a7 4.1). A\nROTSE observation not detected at > 3\u03c3 significance is given as a 3\u03c3 upper limit and\nindicated by the arrow. A single late MDM observation is included as an unfilled point,\nwith no color offset applied. The adopted onset time tGRB is UT 05:59:39. The optical is\nfit with a triple power law, as described in \u00a7 4.1 and reported in Table 4 (solid line). The\noptical decay from 100 to 1000 sec post-onset is t\u22120.74\u00b10.01 . The break after 1000 sec is by\n\u2206\u03b1 = \u22120.43 \u00b1 0.03, which does not fit any expected spectral or jet break in the simple\nfireball model. It may indicate a similar process as that which produces the shallow break in\nGRB 051109A (Fig. 1), see \u00a7 6.4. During the prompt \u03b3-ray emission, lasting until \u223c80\u2013100\nsec post-onset (see Fig. 3), the optical light decays more rapidly than after its end. The\ndashed line shows the back-extrapolation of the lightcurve's fitted power law evolution after\n\u223c 150 sec.\n\n\f\u2013 46 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- GRB 051111 Swift BAT 15\u2013150 keV \u03b3-ray lightcurve, compared to ROTSE-III\nprompt optical detections. The ROTSE flux densities are as described in Fig. 2, now scaled\nby a factor of 0.01 for comparison, and the BAT flux density conversions are described in\n\u00a7 4.3. The adopted onset time tGRB is UT 05:59:39. The linear timescale allows the point\nbefore tGRB to be shown, and thus that the onset matches the beginning of \u03b3-ray emission.\nThere is \u03b3-ray emission to approximately 80\u2013100 sec post-onset. The prompt optical flux\ndeclines more slowly than the smooth tail of \u03b3-ray emission.\n\n\f\u2013 47 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- Comparing GRB 051111's prompt optical and \u03b3-ray flux density and lightcurve\nevolution. Flux density is at the start of ROTSE observations, 31.9 sec after the \u03b3-ray onset.\nThe lightcurve evolution is measured as a power law index, \u03b1, for f\u03bd \u221d t\u03b1 . The total optical\nlightcurve is fit from 31.9\u2013150 sec and the \u03b3-ray BAT lightcurve is fit from 15\u2013200 sec. The\noptical excess is implied by the triple power law, with a shallow prompt phase (Table 4\nand Fig. 2). The excess' implied \u03b1 matches the \u03b3-ray lightcurve. The excess is estimated\nby fitting the optical (t < 1 ksec) and \u03b3-ray (15\u2013200 sec) simultaneously, with an optical\n\"afterglow\" power law plus an excess constrained to have the same \u03b1 as the BAT data (see\n\u00a77). This optical excess fits the data well, showing a good match to the \u03b3-ray \u03b1 determined\nfrom the BAT data alone. The total optical lightcurve's index \u03b1 is not a good match. The\nexcess' flux density level is consistent with an unbroken spectral extrapolation of the BAT\nflux. The dot-dashed line shows the best estimate of the BAT flux density at 31.9 sec,\nextrapolated to optical frequencies via the photon index, \u0393, (fit at t > 10 sec, \u00a74.4). The\ndashed lines give the extrapolation range for 68% confidence limits on \u0393, and dotted lines the\n90% range. The prompt \u03b3-ray emission is compatible with an unbroken extension to optical\nfrequencies, producing the early \"excess\" optical component. See \u00a7 7.1 for a comparison with\nother cases of prompt optical emission and their optical-to-\u03b3 spectra.\n\n\f\u2013 48 \u2013\n\nFig. 5.- Comparison of prompt optical-to-\u03b3-ray spectral indices (\u03b2OP T \u2212\u03b3 ) to the spectral\nindex within the \u03b3-ray band (\u03b2\u03b3 ). The values in Table 5 are plotted for each event, with\nsmall solid circles for \u03b2OP T \u2212\u03b3 , and large open diamonds for \u03b2\u03b3 . Multiple measurements are\nfor events with prompt optical and \u03b3-ray measurements during more than one time interval.\nThe sample shows all possible orderings of \u03b2OP T \u2212\u03b3 relative to \u03b2\u03b3 . The GRB 051111 \u03b2OP T \u2212\u03b3\nvalue uses the prompt optical \"excess\" component, not the total optical flux. This component\nis consistent with an unbroken spectral extrapolation from the high-energy GRB emission,\nsee \u00a7 7. GRB 051109A and GRB 050904 are poorer candidates for such an extension, as\ndiscussed in \u00a7 7.1. Although Vestrand et al. (2005) show a correlation in the optical and\n\u03b3-ray lightcurves for GRB 041219A, there must be a spectral break, such as a synchrotron\npeak, between the two frequency bands.\n\n\f"}
