The latter dominate the observed X-ray fluxes in blazars,\nthe objects with powerful, relativistic jets oriented close to the line of sight. The X-ray\nspectra of these objects extend to high energy \u03b3-rays and origin of both depends on the\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\ntotal luminosity of a source (e.g. Fossati et al. 1998). In the least luminous sources,\ncalled High Energy Peaked BL Lacs, the X-rays are produced by synchrotron emission,\nwhile the \u03b3-rays \u2013 presumably by Comptonization of the synchrotron radiation (SSC). In\nintermediate luminosity objects \u2013 Low Energy Peaked BL Lacs \u2013 both X-rays and \u03b3-rays\nare likely produced by the SSC process. Finally, in the most luminous sources \u2013 Flat\nSpectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQ) \u2013 the high energy spectra are dominated by so-called\nexternal radiation Comptonization (ERC) process, but with a possible contribution to the\nsoft/mid X-ray bands from the SSC radiation. Seed photons for the ERC process may come\ndirectly from the accretion disk (Dermer & Schlickeiser 1993), from the broad line region\n(BLR) (Sikora, Begelman & Rees 1994), and from an optically thick molecular torus in the\nform of thermal IR radiation from hot dust (Bla\u017cejowski et al. 2000). The luminosity of\nFSRQ detected with the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO) is usually dominated\nby GeV radiation. However, there is a subclass of FSRQ with their luminosity peaked in\nthe MeV band. Hereafter we call the former 'GeV-blazars', and the latter 'MeV-blazars'. A\npossible explanation for this division could be related to the location of the radiation site in\nthe jet. As discussed by Sikora et al. (2002), in GeV-blazars radiation is produced closer to\nthe central black hole, while in MeV-blazars, the active region is significantly farther from\nthe center (see Sect. 3 for details). Currently, there are about a dozen known MeV-blazars\nor candidates for such a class; unfortunately any searches for them are limited by the low\nsensitivity of \u03b3-ray detectors in the 1 \u2212 30 MeV band, where their spectra often have a peak.\nPKS 1127-145 is a radio loud quasar at redshift z =1.187 with a radio spectrum peaked\naround 1 GHz, characteristic of the GigaHertz-Peaked (GPS) radio-sources (Stanghellini et\nal. 1998; O'Dea 1998). Chandra observations have revealed a large scale (at least \u223c300 kpc)\nX-ray jet associated with weak radio emission (Siemiginowska et al. 2002). The extended\nradio structure is much weaker (nearly 3 orders of magnitude) than the core emission. This\nvalue is significantly lower in comparison to the typical FRI and FRII sources (Kellerman\n& Owen 1988). VLBI observations show a double component with a parsec scale jet on\none side (Wehrle et al. 1992; Stanghellini et al. 1998). The core emission dominates also\nin X-rays and the total kpc-scale X-ray jet emission is \u223c 60 times fainter than the core\nemission (Siemiginowska et al. 2002). The strong X-ray core has also been detected by\nBeppoSax (Giommi et al. 2002), with the spectrum extending up to \u223c 300 keV. Finally, a\nvery likely counterpart to that core is an EGRET source 2 EG J1134-1515 (Thompson et\nal. 1995).\nWe propose that the high energy emission originating in the central parsec-scale region\nof the quasar PKS 1127-145 can be described in terms of the blazar phenomenon. This can\nbe justified by the following:\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n\u2022 as is the case for many \u03b3-ray detected blazars, but contrary to steep spectrum\nradio quasars (SSRQ), the X-ray and \u03b3-ray luminosities of PKS 1127-145 exceed the\noptical/UV luminosity by a very large factor (for X-rays in SSRQ see, e.g., Sanders,\net al. 1989; Laor et al. 1997);\n\u2022 the X-ray spectrum of PKS 1127-145 is much harder than in SSRQ (\u03b1x \u2243 0.3 \u2212 0.5\nvs. 0.6 \u2212 0.8) (e.g., Reeves & Turner 2000);\n\u2022 in contrast to SSRQ, the luminosity is peaked in the \u03b3-ray band (Thompson et al.\n1995);\n\u2022 the radio spectrum is flat and variable (Wehrle et al. 1992), and superluminal motion\nis observed (Jorstad et al. 2001).\nAt the same time, unlike a typical blazar, PKS 1127-145 has a very low optical\npolarization (Impey and Tapia 1990) and optical variability (Bozyan et al. 1990). This\nsuggests a thermal origin of the optical/UV radiation. Such co-existence of the strong,\nnon-thermal \u03b3-ray component with a prominent thermal UV bump is a characteristic of the\nMeV-blazars. We show that the jet emission model developed by Sikora et al. (2002) for\nMeV-blazars can explain these spectral properties and make prediction that PKS 1127-145\ncan be variable in X-rays and \u03b3-rays on the time scale of the order of a month.\n\n2.\n\nThe observations\n\nWe obtained the multiwavelength spectrum of PKS 1127-145 shown in Figure 1. from\nthe literature. The radio data (Steppe et al. (1995), Geldzahler & Witzel (1981), Kuhr et al.\n(1981), Shimmins & Wall (1973), Wright & Otrupcek (1990), Griffith et al. (1994), Condon\net al. (1998), Large et al. (1981), Douglas, Bash & Bozyan (1996)) were extracted from the\nNED archives. The JHK photometry points are from 2MASS IRSA catalog1 . The EGRET\ndata are taken from Thompson et al. (1995). The X-ray data are from Chandra X-ray\nObservatory (Bechtold et al. 2001, see discussion below) and from BeppoSax (Giommi et\nal. 2002).\nChandra ACIS-S observations of PKS 1127-145 (conducted on 2000-05-28) provide\nconstraints on the jet model parameters. We analyzed the ACIS-S data in CIAO and found\nthe best fit parameters for the assumed absorbed power law model fit to the Chandra X-ray\n1\n\nhttp://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/index.html\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nspectrum (0.3-7 keV; see analysis details in Bechtold et al. 2001, and Siemiginowska et\nal. 2002): photon index \u0393 = 1.29\u00b10.05, absorbing equivalent Hydrogen column NzHabs =0 =\n5.66\u00b10.07 \u00d7 1020 atoms cm \u22122 (in excess to the Galactic column of 3.8 \u00d71020 ). This model\ngives a flux (2-10keV) = 5.35 \u00d7 10\u221212 ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 which corresponds the X-ray luminosity\nof 4.9 \u00d7 1046 ergs s\u22121 . Such a value of \u0393 and the X-ray luminosity are consistent with the\nX-ray emission coming from the jet and a possible relation of this source to the MeV-blazars\nwhich we consider below. This is also strongly supported by a detection of PKS 1127-145\nat hundreds keV with BeppoSax and at hundreds MeV with EGRET.\n\n3.\n\nThe model\n\nHere we apply the shock-in-jet model scenario (e.g. Sikora et al. 2001) to the\nX-ray emission of PKS 1127-145. The emission processes contributing to the X-ray and\ngamma-ray band are related to the Inverse Compton scattering of the soft photons by\nthe relativistic particles in the jet. In the Synchrotron Self-Compton (SSC) process the\nsynchrotron photons emitted by the jet relativistic particles are Compton scattered by the\nsame population of particles. In the External Radiation Compton (ERC) process the seed\nphotons are located outside the jet.\nWe assume that due to collisions of two inhomogeneities propagating down the jet with\ndifferent velocities, the shock is formed at a distance r0 from the jet apex and terminated at\n2r0 . The shock propagates down the conical jet with bulk Lorentz factor \u0393b . In our model\nthe high energy radiation is produced via the Compton process directly by accelerated\nelectrons/positrons. The particles are assumed to stay in the acceleration zone for a much\nshorter period of time than the life-time of the shock and their acceleration/injection is\napproximated by a power-law function, Q \u221d \u03b3 \u2212p , with the energy ranging from \u03b3min to\n\u03b3max .\nIn the External-Radiation-Compton scenario the X-rays are produced by the Compton\nscattering off the electrons in the slow cooling regime, and the gamma-rays by the Compton\nscattering off the electrons in the fast cooling regime (see Sikora et al. 2002 for details).\nThe electron energy dividing both regimes is given by equality of the electron cooling time\nscale, t\u2032c = \u03b3/|\u03b3\u0307|, to the shock life-time, t\u2032 \u2243 \u2206rcoll /(c\u0393b ), where |\u03b3\u0307| \u2243 c\u03c3T u\u2032ext \u03b3 2 /(me c2 ),\nu\u2032ext is the energy density of the external radiation field, and \u2206rcoll is the distance over\nwhich the collision of inhomogeneities takes place. The primed quantities are as measured\nin the shock comoving frame. Hence, the dividing energy is\n\u03b3c =\n\nme c2 \u0393b\n.\n\u03c3T \u2206rcoll u\u2032ext\n\n(1)\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nThe dividing energy is imprinted in the Compton spectrum at the frequency:\nD 2 \u03b3c 2 \u03bdext\n\u03bdc \u2243\n,\n1+z\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03bdext is the frequency of the external photons and D = 1/\u0393b (1 \u2212 \u03b2cos\u03b8) is the Doppler\nfactor of the radiating shocked plasma. The spectrum around \u03bdc changes its slope by\n\u2206\u03b1x\u03b3 \u2243 0.5.\nThe soft photons contributing the most to the external radiation field, u\u2032ext in the AGN\ncores could come from an accretion disk, from the Broad Emission Line Region (BEL) or\nfrom hot dust (IR) associated with an obscuring torus. Because of spectral similarities\nof PKS 1127-145 with the MeV-blazars we assume that the high energy radiation in this\nobject is produced at a few parsecs, where u\u2032ext is strongly dominated by thermal radiation\nof the hot dust. PKS 1127-145 was not detected in the mid- and far-IR bands. However,\nthe measured spectral turnover in the j, h, and ks bands suggests a relatively strong\ncontribution from the hot dust.\nThe presence of the hot dust in AGN is generally accepted as a part of the AGN\nparadigm (Urry & Padovani 1995). The minimal distance of the dust from the central\nengine is determined either by the maximal temperature it can survive,\nrd,min \u223c\n\n1\nTd,max 2\n\n\u00d7 (LU V /4\u03c0\u03c3SB )1/2 ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Td,max \u2243 1000 \u2212 1500K and LU V is the disk luminosity, or by the inner edge of\nthe molecular torus provided it is larger than rd,min given above (see, e.g., Yi, Field, &\nBlackman 1994). In our calculations we approximate the dust distribution as spherical and\nrecover its minimum distance/maximum temperature from a model fit to the observed high\nenergy spectrum. It should be emphasized here, that as long as the distance of the shock\nregion from the black hole is smaller than the distance of dust, the value of u\u2032ext(dust) is not\nvery sensitive to dust geometry, e.g. whether the dust is distributed spherically or is located\nin the flattened torus. The density of the external IR radiation field can be approximated\nby the formula:\n1\n\u03beIR LU V\n\u00d7\n,\n(4)\nuext(dust) \u223c\n2\n4\u03c0crd,min\n1 + (r/rd,min )2\nwhere \u03beIR is the fraction if the UV radiation converted by dust into thermal radiation.\nWe apply the model to PKS 1127-145 assuming that the parsec scale jet is pointing\nat or very close to the line of sight. This can be justified by detection of a superluminal\nmotion in this source during the Multi-epoch VLBA observations with \u03b2app \u223c 19 (Jorstad\net al. 2001). We compute the model by fitting the minimal distance/maximum temperature\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nof dust to the data. The results are presented in Figure 1, which shows the contributing\nmodel components: synchrotron emission, SSC, ERC(IR), ERC(BEL) and ERC(UV).\nThe ERC(BEL) is computed assuming that at r > rBEL luminosity of BEL drops with\na distance \u221d 1/r, where rBEL is the distance at which the BEL luminosity peaks (e.g.,\nPeterson 1993; Kaspi 2000). Parameters of the ERC model are given in the figure caption.\nThey are obtained by matching: the Chandra X-ray spectrum, the EGRET flux, and the\nhigh frequency radio flux. The emission at lower frequencies (below \u223c 1010 Hz) is produced\nat significantly larger distances from the jet apex (in comparison to our model) and thus, is\nnot taken into account in our modeling of the spectrum.\nIn Fig.1. we show also contribution into X-ray and \u03b3-ray bands from Comptonization\nof direct accretion disk radiation (ERC(UV)). Using analytical approximations given\nby Dermer & Schlickeiser (2002), one can find that this contribution at a distance of a\nfew parsecs is about four orders lower than the contribution from Comptonization of IR\nradiation of a hot dust.\nSince observational data in different spectral bands are not simultaneous, the model\nspectral fit and its parameters should be considered only qualitatively. However, the\nChandra and BeppoSax observations which were separated by 12 months, are both\nconsistent with the extension of a very hard X-ray spectrum up to MeV energies and\npeaking at the level of the EGRET detection. Therefore the main result of our model -\nthat X-ray emission of PKS 1127-145 is dominated by Compton scattering of the infrared\nphotons - is not sensitive to the spectral changes between the observations.\n\n4.\n\nDiscussion\n\nOur model shows that the X-ray and gamma-ray spectrum of PKS 1127-145\nmay originate in the parsec scale jet. This emission can be described entirely by the\nComptonization of the IR radiation with a possible contribution from ERC(BEL) at\nenergies > 1GeV. This object is similar to the other MeV-blazars where the SSC component\nis very weak and, therefore, the X-ray spectrum has a very hard slope down to the lowest\nenergies.\nAnother interesting feature of PKS 1127-145 is the co-existence of a prominent UV\nthermal bump (as seen in radio-lobe dominated quasars), with the extremely luminous \u03b3-ray\ncomponent. Both components are very common for the MeV-blazars (see e.g. Tavecchio et\nal. 2000). In our model this co-existence can be associated with the distance between the\nshock and the jet apex which affects the synchrotron emission. The ratio u\u2032ext/u\u2032B is higher\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nfor larger shock distances in MeV-blazars than for smaller shock distances in GeV-blazars,\nwhere in the former case the external radiation is dominated by infrared radiation of dust,\nwhile in the latter case it is dominated by broad emission lines, and u\u2032B = B \u20322 /8\u03c0 is the\nmagnetic energy density in the shocked plasma in a jet. This results in a weaker synchrotron\nspectrum in MeV-blazars than in GeV-blazars assuming that both emit comparable\nbolometric luminosity. Secondly, the entire synchrotron component is shifted into lower\nfrequencies in MeV-blazars (because the average frequency of the synchrotron radiation\n\u2032\n\u2032\nis \u03bdSY N \u221d B and in our model magnetic field scales with distance like B \u221d 1/r). Both\neffects diminish the synchrotron contribution to the UV-band, thus the thermal UV-bump\nbecomes visible. Lower synchrotron luminosities in MeV-blazars explain also why in these\nobjects the SSC component is weak (LSSC \u221d LSY N 2 ) and, therefore, its contribution to the\nX-ray band is negligible (see Sikora et al. 2002).\nThe available EGRET data do not constrain the location of the luminosity peak\nand do not provide a spectral slope for the PKS 1127-145 \u03b3-ray spectrum. Therefore, in\norder to minimize the number of free model parameters we adopted a single-power law\nelectron injection function, instead a double-one assumed in modeling of other MeV-blazars\n(Sikora et al. 2002). This approach leads to a different location of the luminosity peak\nin our model spectrum of PKS 1127-145 (h\u03bd \u223c 100MeV) than in the models of the other\nMeV-blazars (1MeV < h\u03bd < 30MeV). Better \u03b3-ray data are needed in order to apply the\nsame model to both MeV-blazars and PKS 1127-145 and to constrain better the model\nparameters. However, based on the current observations of PKS 1127-145, we conclude\nthat it is quite similar to other MeV-blazars. Since in the model, high energy radiation is\nproduced at a few parsecs, we can predict that PKS 1127-145 should be variable in the\nX-ray and \u03b3-ray bands on a time scale of the order of a month. Monitoring of the source\nwith gamma-ray instruments such as Integral or GLAST may provide an opportunity to\nverify this prediction.\nPKS 1127-145 has been included in samples of GigaHertz Peaked Spectrum (GPS)\nradio sources (Stanghellini et al. 1998). GPS sources are considered to be at an early stage\nof their expansion into large scale radio sources. However, GPS samples are heterogenous\nand may contain many blazars (Lister 2003; Siemiginowska et al. 2003; Stanghellini 2003).\nThe X-ray data provide a way to identify blazars and separate them from the \"true\" GPS\nsources. It is important to understand a number of blazars in the GPS samples, so we can\ntest whether they are consistent with blazars being \"young\" GPS sources, but seen along\nthe jet, with the emission from the GPS double radio component suppressed by the parsec\nscale jet emission. This is critical to our understanding of the nature and evolution of radio\nsources.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nFinally, it is worth noting the similarity of the PKS 1127-145 with other high-z X-ray\nluminous quasars with very hard X-ray spectra, e.g.: 1508+5714 (Moran & Helfand 1997);\nGB 1428+4217 (Fabian et al. 1998; Fabian et al. 2001); PKS 2149-306 (Elvis et al. 2000);\nPMN J0525-3343 (Fabian et al. 2000). All of them are FSRQ and with their peculiar\nspectra, similar to those of MeV-blazars, they can represent those FSRQ which have nuclei\nembedded in a very dusty environment. Such hypothesis can be further explored by detailed\ninfrared spectroscopy of those sources and by observations of \u03b3-ray spectra with GLAST\nwhich are expected to be relatively soft.\nThis research is funded in part by NASA contract NAS8-39073and in part by NASA\nthrough Chandra Award Number GO-01164X and GO2-3148A issued by the Chandra X-Ray\nObservatory Center, which is operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory for\nand on behalf of NASA under contract NAS8-39073 and by Polish KBN grant 5 P03D\n00221.
