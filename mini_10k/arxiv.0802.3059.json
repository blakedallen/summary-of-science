A waveguide was introduced by evaporating Au\nfilm on the top and bottom surfaces of the GaAs AFM\nprobe. A tip having 7 \u03bcm high, 2.0 aspect ratio was\nformed. The dimensions of the cantilever are 250\u00d730\u00d715\n\u03bcm. The open structure of the waveguide at the tip of the\nprobe was obtained by using FIB fabrication. AFM image\nand profile analysis for a standard sample obtained by the\nfabricated GaAs microwave probe and commercial Si\nAFM probe indicate that the fabricated probe has the\nsimilar capability for the measurement of topography of\nmaterials.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nWith the development of nanotechnology, the\nmeasurement of electrical properties in local area of\nmaterials and devices has become a great need. Although\na lot kinds of scanning probe microscope have been\ndeveloped\nfor satisfying\nthe requirement of\nnanotechnology, a microscope technique which can\ndetermine electrical properties in local area is still not\ndeveloped yet. Recently, microwave microscope has been\nan interest to many researchers [1-4], due to its potential\nin the evaluation of electrical properties of materials and\ndevices. The advance of microwave is that the response of\nmaterials is directly relative to the electromagnetic\nproperties of materials.\nIn this paper, the development of a nanostructural\nmicrowave probe was demonstrated. To restrain the\nattenuation of microwave in the probe, GaAs was used as\nthe substrate of the probe. The new structural microwave\nprobe is expected to be used for the measurement of the\nelectrical properties as well as the topography of materials\nand devices.\n2. PROBE FABRICATION\nTo obtain the desired structure, wet etching was used\nto fabricate the probe. Different with the dry etching, a\nside-etching will occur under the etching mask. Utilizing\nthis property, a cone shaped micro tip can be obtained.\nEarly studies suggested that the square resist pattern having\n14 \u03bcm sides and one side to be 45\u00b0 to the <011> direction\n\n\u00a9EDA Publishing/DTIP 2007\n\nwas found to be the most suitable etching mask for\netching the tip of the probe [5]. In the case of single\ncrystalline wafer, such as Si and GaAs, the chemical\nactivities are different for different crystalline planes,\nthereby, the etch rates are also different. Therefore, the\nside plane obtained at the side of the mask pattern is the\nmost inactive plane (that is the plane having the most low\netching speed) which is parallel to the side of the mask\npattern. Consequently, the result of etching is strong\naffected by the direction of mask pattern [6-8]. By\nconsidering the chemical activities at different crystalline\nplanes, the length direction of the etching mask for\nforming the beam of the cantilever was patterned along\nthe <011> direction. Consequently, the side-etching\noccurs under the resist mask, and mesa type planes appear\nat the both sides of the beam (45o inclined plane). On the\nother hand, inverse-mesa type plane is formed at the end\nof the beam (60-75o inclined plane). Under the same\nconditions as the beam fabrication process, holder was\nformed by back side etching. The etching mask was\npatterned on the bottom surface, and etching was carried\nout until the substrate was penetrated. The process to\nfabricate a GaAs AFM probe was described in details in\nRef. [9]. On the other hand, Au film was deposited on top\nand bottom surfaces of the probe to propagate a\nmicrowave signal in the probe. The thickness of the film\nis 50 nm. Both plane surfaces of the waveguide which\nwere evaporated Au film are connected at the end of the\nbeam. However, there is no Au film on the sides of the\nbeam, since the formed inclined planes at the beam sides\nare not face to the direction of the evaporation. By using\nfocused ion beam (FIB) fabrication, a slit at the tip of\nprobe was formed to open the connection of the Au film\non the two surfaces of the probe.\n3. PROBE EVALUATION\nFig 1 shows Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)\nphotography of the tip of the fabricated microwave probe\nbased on GaAs. The tip is observed located near the front\nedge of the cantilever. It is 7 \u03bcm high and having an\naspect ratio of 2.0.the width of the micro slit is about 200\nnm.\nIn order to confirm the resolution of the fabricated\nGaAs microwave probes, the AFM topography of two\ngrating samples having 2000 line/mm and 17.9 nm step\nheight were measured by the fabricated GaAs microwave\n\nISBN: 978-2-35500-000-3\n\n\fYang Ju, Tetsuya Kobayashi, Hitoshi Soyama\nDevelopment of a Nanostructural Microwave Probe Based on GaAs\n\nFig. 1 SEM photograph of the tip and the micro slit of the\nGaAs microwave probe\n\nprobes, and commercial Si AFM probe, respectively.\nJSPM-5400 was used for measurement of the sample in\nnon-contact mode. The properties of these AFM probes\nwere given in Table 1. The resonance frequency was\nswept and Q-value is defined by the following relation, Q\n= f0/(f+ - f-), where Q is the Q-value of the probe, f0 the\nscanned peak frequency (resonance frequency), f+ and fthe shifted frequency from f0 at the 70.7 % of peak\nintensity. Q- value indicates a resonance sharpness of\ncantilever, the higher of the Q-value, the better stabilizing\nof the oscillation. As shown in Table 1, fabricated GaAs\nmicrowave probe C and E have higher Q-value than the\ncommercial Si probe.\n3.1. Evaluation of topographies\nFig. 2-5 show the non-contact mode AFM\ntopographies of the grating sample having 2000 lines/mm\nobtained by the fabricated GaAs microwave probe A, C,\nD, E. The scan area was 3\u00d73 \u03bcm. The white spots in these\nfigures are due to micro-dusts on the sample surface.\nHigher resolution topographies were obtained by probe C\nand E which have the high Q-value comparing to probe A\nand D. However, the probe B didn't take good scanning\nperformance because of the lower Q-value.\n\nFig. 2 Surface topography of the grating sample obtained\nby the fabricated GaAs microwave probe A\n\nFig. 3 Surface topography of the grating sample obtained\nby the fabricated GaAs microwave probe C\n\n3.2. Comparison with Si AFM probe\nFig. 3 shows the topography of the sample obtained\nby the fabricated GaAs microwave probe C, which\nindicates that the grating depth is 20-30 nm.

Fig. 6 shows the non-contact mode\nAFM topography obtained by using commercial Si\ncantilever, in which the grating depth is shown to be 3050 nm. Even through the Q-value is lower than that of\nprobe C and E, the commercial Si probe still can obtain a\nhigher resolution topography because of the higher aspect\nratio of the tip. These results illustrate that the tip of the\nGaAs microwave probe having the similar capability to\nsense the surface topography of materials as that of\ncommercial AFM probe.\n3.3. Evaluation of height accuracy\nIn order to evaluate height accuracy, the grating\nsample having 17.9 nm\u00b11 nm step height was measured\n\n\u00a9EDA Publishing/DTIP 2007\n\nFig. 8 Profile analysis using by commercial Si AFM probe\n\nby using probe C and Si probe. As shown in Fig. 7, by\nanalyzing profile of the sample, microwave probe C\nresults the step height to be 18.60 nm. In contrast,\nmeasurement result by using commercial Si probe\nindicates the step height to be 18.62 nm, as shown in Fig.\n8. These results suggest that the fabricated microwave\nprobe has the similar height evaluation capability as that\nof commercial AFM probe.\n4.
