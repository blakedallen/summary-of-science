We consider the\ncase in which the dual action of the quotient group is free\nalmost everywhere. This result applies to yield a HausdorffYoung inequality for nonunimodular groups.\n\n0. Introduction\nIn this paper we deal with a definition of Lp -Fourier transform on locally\ncompact groups. Recall that, for locally compact abelian groups, the Hausdorff-Young inequality reads:\nb\nLet 1 < p < 2 and q = p/(p \u2212 1). If g \u2208 L1 (G) \u2229 Lp (G), then gb \u2208 Lq (G),\nwith kb\ng kq \u2264 kgkp .\nThe inequality allows to extend the Fourier transform to a continuous operator F p : Lp \u2192 Lq by continuity. It was generalized to type I unimodular\ngroups by Kunze [13]. Over the years, various authors derived HausdorffYoung inequalities both for concrete groups [14, 1, 8, 7] and for certain\nclasses of groups [16, 17, 18, 10, 2], with the aim of getting a more precise\nbound in the inequality.\nThe formulation of the results for nonabelian groups requires a certain\nb\namount of notation. Given a locally compact group G, we denote by G\nits unitary dual, i.e., the set of (equivalence classes of) irreducible unitary\nrepresentations, endowed with the Mackey Borel structure. The dual space\nis used to define the operator valued Fourier transform by letting\nL1 (G) \u220b g 7\u2192 F 1 (g) := (\u03c3(g))\u03c3\u2208Gb ,\n\nwhere \u03c3(g) is defined by the weak operator integral\nZ\ng(x)\u03c3(x)dx .\n\u03c3(g) =\nG\n\nThe main task for Plancherel theory in the nonabelian setting is to find\nsuitable Banach spaces for these operators, which is what we describe next.\nFor a Hilbert space H, we denote by Bp (H) the set of bounded operators\nT such that (T \u2217 T )p/2 is trace class. Bp (H) is a Banach space with the\nobvious norm kT kp = tr((T \u2217 T )p/2 )1/p . The Plancherel theorem for type\n1\n\n\f2\n\nH. F\u00dcHR\n\nI unimodular locally compact groups [5, 18.8.2] provides the existence of\nb with the following properties: Given a\na Plancherel measure \u03bdG on G\nb denote by Bp\u2295 (p >\nmeasurable realization (\u03c3, H\u03c3 ) of representatives from G,\n1) the space of operator fields A = (A\u03c3 )\u03c3\u2208Gb such that A\u03c3 \u2208 Bp (H\u03c3 ) a.e.,\nand moreover that\n\u00131/p\n\u0012Z\np\nkA\u03c3 kp d\u03bdG (\u03c3)\nkAkp := k(A\u03c3 )\u03c3 kBp\u2295 :=\nb\nG\n\nis finite. It is routine to check that (Bp\u2295 , k * kBp\u2295 ) is a Banach space; for p = 2\n\u2295 for the space\neven a Hilbert space. It is convenient to use the notation B\u221e\nof uniformly bounded operator fields. Note that since k\u03c0(g)k \u2264 kgk1 , for\narbitrary representations of g, we have the estimate\n(1)\n\nkF(g)k\u221e \u2264 kgk1\n\nNow, the Plancherel theorem for unimodular groups states that for the\nunique Plancherel measure \u03bdG and for all g \u2208 L2 (G) \u2229 L1 (G), we have\n(2)\n\nkF(g)kB\u2295 = kgk2 .\n2\n\nThis gives rise to the Plancherel transform\nP = F 2 : L2 (G) \u2192 B2\u2295 ,\nwhich is a unitary equivalence. The Hausdorff-Young inequality then states\nthat, for all 1 \u2264 p \u2264 2 and g \u2208 Lp (G) \u2229 L1 (G), we have\n(3)\n\nkF(g)kBq\u2295 \u2264 kgkp ,\n\nwhere q = p/(p \u2212 1), which uniquely defines a Fourier transform F p :\nLp (G) \u2192 Bq\u2295 . The proof of the inequality usually involves interpolation\ntechniques to derive the estimate from the inequalities at the \"endpoints\",\ni.e., from (1) and (2). However, for a sharper estimate of the operator norm\nof Fp , in the following denoted by Ap (G), other techniques are required.\nFor nonunimodular groups, an additional complication arises. As Khalil\nshowed for the ax+b-group [11], there exist g \u2208 Cc (G) such that, for \u03bdG almost all \u03c3, F 1 (g)(\u03c3) is not a compact operator, and hence F 1 (g) 6\u2208 Bq\u2295 ,\nfor arbitrary q!\nHowever, there is a way to save the Plancherel theorem, first obtained in\n[11] for the ax+b-group and proved later on in full generality in [6]. The\nPlancherel theorem in [6] can be phrased as follows: Let G be a nonunimodular locally compact group with type I regular representation. There exists a\nfield of unbounded selfadjoint operators (K\u03c3 )\u03c3\u2208Gb , called formal dimension\nb such that, for every g \u2208 L2 (G) \u2229 L1 (G)\noperators, and a measure \u03bdG on G,\n1/2\nand \u03bdG -almost every \u03c3, the densely defined operator \u03c3(g)K\u03c3 extends to a\n\n\fHAUSDORFF-YOUNG INEQUALITIES FOR NONUNIMODULAR GROUPS\n\n3\n\n1/2\n\nHilbert-Schmidt operator, denoted [\u03c3(g)K\u03c3 ], and moreover\nZ\n2\n[\u03c3(g)K\u03c31/2 ] d\u03bdG (\u03c3) = kgk22 .\nb\nG\n\n2\n\nThe operators are unique up to scalar multiples, and once they are fixed, so\nis the measure \u03bdG . Similar results were obtained by [12, 19].\nThere does not seem to be a general treatment of the Hausdorff-Young\ninequality for nonunimodular groups. Apparently Terp proved such a result\nin a preprint mentioned in [10, 2]; however the paper seems never to have\nappeared, and I have not been able to locate a copy of the preprint. Several\nauthors established Hausdorff-Young inequalities for the ax+b-group [7,\n16]. To my knowledge, the largest class of groups under consideration were\nthe solvable Lie groups acting on Siegel domains, as investigated by Inoue\n[10]. The result is fairly intuitive, once we have seen how to treat the L2 case: Letting\nF p (g)(\u03c3) := [\u03c3(g)K\u03c31/q ]\ngives a well-defined operator from L1 (G) \u2229 Lp (G) into Bq\u2295 fulfilling\nkF p (g)kq \u2264 kgkp .\nThe first theorem shows that this result is true for more general nonunimodular groups:\nTheorem 1. Let G be a nonunimodular locally compact group such that \u03bbG\nis type I and N = Ker(\u2206G ) is type I. Let (K\u03c3 )\u03c3\u2208Gb denote the field of formal\ndegree operators, and \u03bdG the Plancherel measure of G belonging to that field.\nLet 1 < p < 2 and q = p/(p \u2212 1).\nb the operator\nThen, for all g \u2208 L1 (G) \u2229 Lp (G) and \u03bdG -almost all \u03c3 \u2208 G,\n1/q\n1/q\n\u03c3(g)K\u03c3 has a bounded extension [\u03c3(g)K\u03c3 ] \u2208 Bq (H\u03c3 ), and we have the\ninequality\n\u0012Z\n\u00131/q\n1/q q\n\u2264 Ap (N )kgkp ,\nk[\u03c3(g)K\u03c3 ]kBq (H\u03c3 ) d\u03bdG (\u03c3)\n\u011c\n\ni.e., Ap (G) \u2264 Ap (N ).\nTheorem 1 is a special case of a more general, somewhat technical result\n(Theorem 2 below), which proves a Hausdorff-Young inequality for certain\ngroup extensions\n1\u2192N \u2192G\u2192H\u21921\nwith the additional properties that N and H are unimodular and the dual\nb is free \u03bdN -almost everywhere.\naction of H on N\n\n\f4\n\nH. F\u00dcHR\n\n1. Group extensions with free dual actions\nNow let G be a second countable locally compact group. \u03bcG denotes leftinvariant Haar measure, and \u2206G denotes the modular function of G. We\nassume that G is an extension of the unimodular normal subgroup N , and\nthat H = G/N is unimodular as well. Moreover we assume that N is type\nI and G has a type I regular representation, and denote the Plancherel\nb\nmeasures by \u03bdN and \u03bdG , respectively. It is well-known that H acts on N\nb \u220b (\u03b3, \u03c3) 7\u2192 \u03b3.\u03c3. Mackey's theory allows\nvia conjugation, denoted by H \u00d7 N\nb\nthe computation of G from this action, at least under certain regularity\nconditions. As observed in [12], the Mackey machine also provides the\nmeans to compute Plancherel measure, under suitable assumptions on N\nand the dual action. Our main technical assumption is the following:\nb with the following prop(A) There exists a Borel \u03bdN -conull subset U \u2282 N\nerty: U is H-invariant with U/H standard. Moreover, for all \u03c30 \u2208 U ,\nb\nIndG \u03c30 \u2208 G.\nN\n\nIn view of Mackey's theory, we obtain the following consequences:\nb\n(i) IndG\nN \u03c30 \u2208 G for every \u03c30 \u2208 U implies that H operates freely on the\nb\norbit H.\u03c30 . Moreover, IndG\nN induces an injective map Ind : U/H \u0592\u2192 G.\n(ii) Since U/H is standard, there exists a measure decomposition along\nH-orbits (see for instance [12, Theorem 2.1]). More precisely, there\nexist measures \u03b2H.\u03c30 on the orbits, such that the Plancherel measures\nof N and G obey the relation\n\n(4)\n\nd\u03bdN (\u03c1) = d\u03b2H.\u03c1 (\u03c1)d\u03bdG (H.\u03c1) .\n\nThat the Plancherel measure of G may be obtained as a quotient measure of \u03bdN , follows from Theorem [12, I, 10.2]. For this we need to\ncheck four conditions:\nbt . This follows from the type\n(I) \u03bbN is type I with \u03bdN concentrated in N\nI property of N .\n(II) \u03bdN /H is countably separated. This holds by Assumption (A).\n(III) \u03bdN -almost every little fixed group is trivial. This holds by Assumption (A).\n(IV) \u03bbG is type I. This holds by assumption.\n(iii) The fact that H acts freely on U entails that U can be seen as a product\nspace H \u00d7 U0 , by the following arguments: Since both U and U/H are\nb ), [15, Theorem 5.2] provides the\nstandard, (U as a Borel subset of N\nexistence of a Borel transversal, i.e. a Borel subset U0 \u2282 U meeting\neach H-orbit in precisely one point. Hence the freeness of the operation\nyields a measurable bijection H \u00d7 U0 \u2261 U , (\u03b3, \u03c30 ) 7\u2192 \u03b3.\u03c30 , which by\n[15, Theorem 3.2] is a Borel isomorphism. In the following, we use\n\n\fHAUSDORFF-YOUNG INEQUALITIES FOR NONUNIMODULAR GROUPS\n\n5\n\nfor \u03c3 \u2208 V the symbol \u03c30 \u2208 U0 to denote the representative of the\nassociated dual orbit.\n(iv) The Borel isomorphism U \u2261 H \u00d7 U0 allows to write down the measure\ndisintegration (4) much more explicitly. For this purpose we define\nthe mapping \u03c8 : (h, \u03c30 ) 7\u2192 \u2206G (h) on U . Note that \u03c8 \u2261 1 iff G is\nunimodular. Then (4) becomes\n(5)\n\nd\u03bdN (h, \u03c30 ) = \u03c8(h)d\u03bcH (h)d\u03bdG (\u03c3) .\nIndeed, a straightforward computation establishes that \u03bdN (\u03b3.A) =\n\u2206G (\u03b3)\u03bdN (A). This shows that\nd\u03b2H.\u03c30 (\u03b3.\u03c30 ) = \u03b1(H.\u03c30 )\u03c8(\u03b3)d\u03bcH (\u03b3) ,\n\nfor some scalar factor \u03b1(H.\u03c30 ). Now \u03bdG can be renormalized to achieve\nthat these factors are one.\n2\n(v) For the following calculations, \u03c3 = IndG\nN \u03c30 is realized on H\u03c3 = L (H,\nd\u03bcH ; H\u03c30 ) via cross sections (see Lemma 4). We define a family of\noperators K\u03c3 on H\u03c3 given by multiplication with \u2206G :\n(K\u03c3 \u03b7)(h) = \u2206G (h)\u03b7(h) ,\nand dom(K\u03c3 ) is the set of all \u03b7 \u2208 L2 (H, d\u03bcH ; H\u03c30 ), for which this\nproduct is also square integrable.\nObviously K\u03c3 is the identity operator if G is unimodular. In the\nother case, K\u03c3 is precisely the formal dimension operator, as can be\nseen by verifying the semi-invariance relation\n\u03c3(x)K\u03c3 \u03c3(x)\u2217 = \u2206G (x)\u22121 K\u03c3 ,\nobserving that the formal dimension operators obey the same relation [6, Theorem 5], and then applying the uniqueness statement [6,\nLemma 1].\n2. Hausdorff-Young inequalities for group extensions\nThe following theorem is the main result of this paper.\nTheorem 2. Let a group extension 1 \u2192 N \u2192 G \u2192 H \u2192 1 be given with\nN, H unimodular, N a type I group, and \u03bbG a type I representation. Assume\nthat assumption (A) holds. Let (K\u03c3 )\u03c3\u2208Gb denote the field of multiplication\noperators given in (iv) above. Let 1 < p < 2 and q = p/(p \u2212 1).\nb the operator\nThen, for all g \u2208 L1 (G) \u2229 Lp (G) and \u03bdG -almost all \u03c3 \u2208 G,\n1/q\n1/q\n\u03c3(g)K\u03c3 has a bounded extension [\u03c3(g)K\u03c3 ] \u2208 Bq (H\u03c3 ), and we have the\ninequality\n\u00131/q\n\u0012Z\n1/q q\n\u2264 Ap (N )kgkp ,\nk[\u03c3(g)K\u03c3 ]kBq (H\u03c3 ) d\u03bdG (\u03c3)\n\u011c\n\ni.e., Ap (G) \u2264 Ap (N ).\n\n\f6\n\nH. F\u00dcHR\n\nBefore we prove this result, let us show how the nonunimodular case\nfollows from it:\nProof of Theorem 1: N = Ker(\u2206G ) is a normal unimodular subgroup,\nwith H = G/N abelian. Assumption (A) holds by [6, Theorem 6]. Thus\nTheorem 2 implies Theorem 1.\n\u0003.\nWe now proceed with the proof of Theorem 2. It turns out that it is a\nquite natural extension of the arguments used in [16] for the ax+b-group,\nessentially by combining it with techniques from [12]. First we show how\n\u03c3(f ) acts via an operator valued integral kernel. We then use an estimate\nof the p-norm of such operators by certain cross norms, as provided by [9].\nThe first lemma computes the Haar measure of G in terms of \u03bcN and\n\u03bcH , and fixes the normalizations we use in the following. Note that, since\nN is normal, \u2206G |N = \u2206N = 1, hence \u2206G can (and will) be regarded as a\nfunction on H.\nLemma 3. Fix a measurable cross-section \u03b1 : H \u2192 G. Then the mapping\nN \u00d7 H \u220b (n, h) 7\u2192 n\u03b1(h) \u2208 G is an isomorphism of Borel spaces. We use\nthe notation g = n\u03b1(h) \u2261 (n, h). Then\n(6)\n\nd\u03bcG (n, h) = d\u03bcN (n)\u2206G (h)d\u03bcH (h)\n\nis a left Haar measure.\nProof. The map (n, h) 7\u2192 n\u03b1(h) is a measurable bijection between standard Borel spaces, and thus a Borel isomorphism [15, Theorem 3.2]. Fix\ng = n\u03b1(h), g \u2032 = n\u2032 \u03b1(h\u2032 ) \u2208 G, then\ngg\u2032 = n \u03b1(h)n\u2032 \u03b1(h)\u22121 \u03b1(h)\u03b1(h)\u2032 \u03b1(hh\u2032 )\u22121 \u03b1(hh\u2032 )\nwith \u03b1(h)n\u2032 \u03b1(h)\u22121 , \u03b1(h)\u03b1(h)\u2032 \u03b1(hh\u2032 )\u22121 \u2208 N (observing N \u22b3 G). Hence\nright translation on G corresponds to right translation in the variables\nn, h, though not by n\u2032 , h\u2032 . Now the rightinvariance of \u03bcN , \u03bcH entails that\nd\u03bcN (n)d\u03bcH (h) is a right Haar measure on G. But then \u2206G d\u03bcN d\u03bcH is a left\nHaar measure.\n\u0003\nThe following two lemmas provide the integral kernels:\nLemma 4. Let \u03c30 \u2208 U0 and \u03c3 = IndG\nN \u03c30 .

Let \u03c30 \u2208 U0 and \u03c3 = IndG\nN \u03c30 . For g \u2208 L (G) let g\u03b3 := g(*, \u03b3).\nThen \u03c3(g) : L2 (H, d\u03bcH ; H\u03c30 ) \u2192 L2 (H, d\u03bcH ; H\u03c30 ) can be written as\nZ\nk\u03c3 (\u03be, \u03b3)f (\u03b3)d\u03b3 ,\n\u03c3(g)f (\u03be) =\nH\n\nwhere k\u03c3 is an operator valued integral kernel given by\n\nk\u03c3 (\u03be, \u03b3) = (\u03be.\u03c30 )(g\u03be\u03b3 \u22121 ) \u25e6 \u03c30 (\u039b(\u03be\u03b3 \u22121 , \u03be)) * \u2206G (\u03be\u03b3 \u22121 ) .\nProof. First note that by Fubini's theorem g\u03b3 \u2208 L1 (N ), for almost\nevery \u03b3 \u2208 H, which justifies the use of (\u03be.\u03c30 )(g\u03be\u03b3 \u22121 ). The following formal\ncalculations can be made rigorous by plugging them into scalar products,\naccording to the definition of the weak operator integral. Using the previous\nlemma and unimodularity of H, we see that\nZ Z\ng(n, \u03b3)(\u03be.\u03c30 )(n)\u03c30 (\u039b(\u03b3, \u03be))f (\u03b3 \u22121 \u03be)dn\u2206G (\u03b3)d\u03b3\n(\u03c3(g)f )(\u03be) =\nZH N\n(\u03be.\u03c30 )(g\u03b3 )\u03c30 (\u039b(\u03b3, \u03be))f (\u03b3 \u22121 \u03be)\u2206G (\u03b3)d\u03b3\n=\nZH\n(\u03be.\u03c30 )(g\u03b3 \u22121 )\u03c30 (\u039b(\u03b3 \u22121 , \u03be))f (\u03b3\u03be)\u2206G (\u03b3 \u22121 )d\u03b3\n=\nH\nZ\n(\u03be.\u03c30 )(g\u03be\u03b3 \u22121 )\u03c30 (\u039b(\u03be\u03b3 \u22121 , \u03be))\u2206G (\u03be\u03b3 \u22121 )f (\u03b3)d\u03b3 ,\n=\nH\n\nwhich is the desired formula.\n\u0003\np\n1\nProof of Theorem 2: Let g \u2208 L (G) \u2229 L (G) be given.

The last\ninequality in the argument is now an instance of the Plancherel theorem\nfor N , hence once more an equality. Hence the computation provides a\nrather concrete proof that \u03bd = \u03bdG , once the two measures are proven to be\nequivalent.\n\u0003\nRemark 7. The type I assumption on N ensures that we may define the\nspaces Bq\u2295 as direct integrals of Schatten-von-Neumann spaces. In the general case, other traces than the natural operator trace may occur. For this\nsetting, an extension of the norm estimates for Hilbert-Schmidt-valued kernels by cross norms, as obtained in [16], to more general traces will be\nrequired.\n\u0003\n\n\f10\n\nH.
