Consider the 2D Euler\nequations (the EEs) of inviscid incompressible fluids\n(1.1)\n\nut + (u * \u2207)u = \u2212\u2207p,\n\ndiv u = 0 in R2 \u00d7 (0, T ) (u = (u1 , u2)T ),\n\nwith bounded initial divergence-free u0 of infinite kinetic L2 -energy. Using Leray's formulation with the projector P = I \u2212 \u2207\u2206\u22121 (\u2207*), (1.1) is written in the form [12, p. 30]\nR x\u2212y\n1\nut + (Du) u = B(u) \u2261 2\u03c0\ntr (\u2207u(y, t))2 dy, where\n|x\u2212y|2\nR2\n\u0014\n\u0015\n(1.2)\nP\n(u1)x1 (u1 )x2\n2\ntr (\u2207u) =\n(uj )xi (ui )xj and Du =\n(u2)x1 (u2 )x2\n(i,j)\n\nis the 2 \u00d7 2 Jacobian matrix of the solenoidal vector field u.\nIt is well-known that, even in dimension 2 (to say nothing about the 3D ones), the\nstandard notion of weak solutions is not sufficient for establishing the unique solvability of\nthe problem in the case of the unbounded initial vorticity, where curl u0 6\u2208 L\u221e . See Majda\u2013\nBertozzi [12, \u00a7 8] and recent surveys in Bardos\u2013Titi [1], Constantin [4], and Ohkitani\n[13] for further details and key references, as well as Pomeau et al [17] for discussion of\nsomehow related open questions on shock waves in hyperbolic systems. It seems obvious\nthat natural reasons for this difficulty are two fold. Firstly, there is no still a proper\ndefinition of \"entropy solutions\" for the EEs admitting sufficiently strong \"shock waves\".\nDate: November 21, 2018.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 35K55, 35K65.\nKey words and phrases. 2D Euler equations, hyperbolic system, shock and rarefaction waves, similarity\nsolutions with blow-up swirl. Submitted to: Math. Theory of Fluid Dyn.\n1\n\n\fIn other words, general principles of formation of various singularities of shock wave types,\nas well as L\u221e -blow-up, are in general unknown. Secondly, on the other hand, even the\ncorresponding system without the nonlocal term\n(1.3)\n\nut + (Du)u = 0 in R2 \u00d7 R+\n\nis a rather difficult divergent hyperbolic system 2\u00d72 with two independent spatial variables\nx = (x1 , x2 ), so it does not automatically fall into the scope of modern entropy theory\nregardless of its definite recent achievements; see Bressan [2] and Dafermos [5]. Of course,\nsome classes of solutions of systems such as (1.3) can be represented via characteristics (see\ninteresting physically motivated formal discussions in [17]), though, in general, choosing\nright weak \"entropy\" solutions is not straightforward and is an open problem.\nOur goal is to introduce a new PDE model, which may reflect some features of formation\nof finite-time singularities in systems such as (1.1) (and partially (1.3)) and, in addition,\nhaving vorticity-swirl structure that can be somehow adequate to the EEs. To this end,\nto discuss possible ways of shock wave formation for the EEs, let us write down (1.1) in\nthe polar coordinates (r, \u03c6),\n\uf8f1\n1\n1\n2\n\uf8f2Ut + UUr + r V U\u03c6 \u2212 r V = \u2212Pr ,\nVt + UVr + 1r V V\u03c6 + 1r UV = \u2212 1r P\u03c6 ,\n(1.4)\n\uf8f3\nUr + 1r U + 1r V\u03c6 = 0.\nThough (1.4) is a system of three PDEs, which is equivalent to the nonlocal equation\n(1.2), we consider a rather hypothetical situation of formation of shocks created by local\ndifferential operators only1, though, as we have seen, this scenario is expected to be also\nrelevant to the hyperbolic system (1.3).\nLet us then more precisely define a manifold of solutions with shocks to be studied:\n(i) Formation of bounded shocks (or bounded rarefaction waves) is not essentially affected by the pressure terms, i.e., by the nonlocal members (however, the div-free equation\nremains important); and\n(ii) As in the classic case (1.7) below, two quadratic first-order operators in the first\nand in the second equations in (1.4) are leading together with two differential terms in\nthe div-free equation (the latter is reasonable for finite shocks):\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 Ut + UUr + ... = 0,\nVt + 1r V V\u03c6 + ... = 0,\n(1.5)\n\uf8f3\nUr + 1r V\u03c6 + ... = 0.\n\nThus, we omit other operators that are expected to be bounded on such singularities.\n1Obviously,\n\nthis is not the case for 3D unbounded L\u221e -singularities, where quadratic nonlocal terms\nmust be involved and this settles the core of such a remarkable open problem, [4].\n2\n\n\fReplacing V by rV for convenience yields\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2Ut + UUr + ... = 0,\nVt + V V\u03c6 + ... = 0,\n(1.6)\nV 7\u2192 rV =\u21d2\n\uf8f3\nUr + V\u03c6 + ... = 0.\n\nThe first two equations are indeed the famous 1D Euler equations from gas dynamics,\n\n(1.7)\n\nu(x, 0) = u0 (x) \u2208 L1 \u2229 L\u221e ,\n\nut + uux = 0 in R \u00d7 R+ ,\n\nwhose entropy theory was created by Oleinik [14, 15] and Kruzhkov [11] (equations in RN )\nin the 1950\u201360s; see details on the history, main results, and modern developments in the\nwell-known monographs [2, 5, 20]2. Typical formation of shocks for (1.7) as t \u2192 0\u2212 (the\nblow-up time here is T = 0) is described by the canonical self-similar blow-up solution\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 1 for x < t,\nx\nfor | xt | < 1,\n(1.8)\nu\u2212 (x, t) =\n\uf8f3 t\n\u22121 for x > \u2212t.\n\nTherefore, the following steady shock is formed:\n(1.9)\n1\n\nlimt\u21920\u2212 u\u2212 (x, t) = S\u2212 (x) \u2261 \u2212sign x,\n\nwith convergence in L (R) and uniformly on any subset bounded away from the origin.\nMoreover, we have that, as t \u2192 0\u2212 ,\n(1.10)\n\nDx u\u2212 (x, t) =\n\n1\nt\n\n\u2192 \u2212\u221e for any |x| < |t| and Dx u\u2212 (x, t) \u2192 \u22122\u03b4(x).\n\nIndeed, such a standard scenario of shock wave formation is not applicable for the\nsystem in (1.6), since the last div-free equation\n(1.11)\n\nUr + V\u03c6 + ... = 0\n\nprohibits simultaneous blow-up of derivatives Ur and V\u03c6 to \u2212\u221e. Therefore, the system\n(1.6) needs another more involved treatment of possible (if any) shock waves. We next\nintroduce such a nonlinear PDE model.\n1.2. A simplified PDE model and main results. Thus, we consider first two equations in (1.6) on the \"critical manifold\" (1.11), i.e.,\n\u001a\n\u001a\nUt + UUr = 0,\nUt = UV\u03c6 ,\n(1.12)\n=\u21d2\nVt + V V\u03c6 = 0 Ur +V\u03c6 =0\nVt = V Ur ,\nwith given bounded smooth initial data (U0 , V0 )(r, \u03c6). Writing this in the form\n\u001a\n(ln |U|)t = V\u03c6 ,\n(1.13)\n(ln |V |)t = Ur ,\n2First\n\nstudy of finite time singularities as shock waves of quasilinear equations was performed by\nRiemann in 1858 [18] (Riemann's method and invariants are originated therein); see [3, 17] for details.\nThe implicit solution of the problem (1.7), u(x, t) = u0 (x\u2212u(x, t)t) (containing the key wave \"overturning\"\neffect) was obtained earlier by Poisson in 1808 [16]; see [17].\n3\n\n\fwe find on integration of the second equation that\nRt\nRt\nU (s)\n0 r\n(1.14)\nln VV(t)\n=\n.\nU\n(s)\n=\u21d2\nV\n(t)\n=\nV\ne\nr\n0\n0\n0\n\nSubstituting this V (t) into the first equation for U yields the following nonlocal PDE:\nRt\nRt\n\u0001Rt\n(1.15)\nUt = UV0\u03c6 e 0 Ur (s) + UV0 e 0 Ur (s) 0 Ur\u03c6 (s) \u2261 J1 + J2 .\n\nAccording to (1.15), there exist at least two different mechanisms of shock wave formation\ncorresponding to nonlinear integral operators J1 and J2 , and possibly, other types via their\nnonlinear interactions. Note that the problem corresponding to J2 is assumed to be truly\n2D (and hence difficult), while that for J1 can be reduced to 1D.\nWe begin with the simplest scenario corresponding to J1 , for which we choose initial\ndata V0 such that, in a small neighbourhood of a possible shock at (0, 0),\n(1.16)\n\nV0\u03c6 \u2248 +1 and V0 \u2248 0.\n\nThis locally yields the equation\n(1.17)\n\nRt\n\nUt = Ue\n\n0\n\nUr (s)\n\nor\n\nln\n\nUt\nU\n\n\u0001\n\n=\n\nRt\n0\n\nUr (s),\n\nwhere we assume\n\nUt\nU\n\n> 0.\n\nDifferentiating this equation in t and, for convenience, renaming the variables\n(1.18)\n\nr 7\u2192 x and U(r, t) 7\u2192 u(x, t)\n\nyields the necessary equation for such shock wave and blowing up formation:\n\u0001\nut\n(1.19)\n= uxuut or uutt \u2212 (ut )2 = uux ut .\nu t\n\nWritten in the form with the evolution time-variable x and t being the space variable,\n\u0002\n2\u0003\n(1.20)\nux = u1t utt \u2212 (uut ) ,\n\nthe equation becomes\n(1.21)\n\nof parabolic type in the domain of time-monotonicity {ut > 0}\n\nand parabolic backward in time otherwise. In what follows, we will need carefully control\nthe parabolicity condition (1.21) in order to guarantee the well-posedness of our shock\nand blow-up phenomena. In the original independent variables {x, t}, which assume two\ninitial conditions at t = 0, (1.19) exhibits different evolution properties. Note that, in\nterms of t as the time variable, this equation\n(1.22)\n\nutt =\n\nuux ut +(ut )2\nu\n\nis in the normal form in the non-singular set {u 6= 0}, so it obeys there the Cauchy\u2013\nKovalevskaya Theorem [21, p. 387]. Hence, for analytic initial data u(x, 0) 6= 0 and\nut (x, 0), there exists a unique local in time analytic solution u(x, t). On the other hand,\nany existing solution u(x, t), which is analytic in {u 6= 0}, has a unique local analytic\ncontinuation at any point, where u 6= 0.\n4\n\n\fLet us make an important comment concerning the type of this new PDE. Written as\na first-order system for U = (u, v)T , with v = ut , (1.19) takes the form\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014 \u0015\nv\n0 0\n(1.23)\nUt = A(U)Ux + F (U), where A(U) =\nand F (U) = v2 .\nv 0\nu\nIt follows that the characteristic equation for the matrix A(U) has the trivial form\n(1.24)\n\ndet (A(U) \u2212 \u03bbI2 ) = 0\n\n=\u21d2\n\n\u03bb2 = 0.\n\nTherefore the eigenvalues always coincide, \u03bb\u00b1 = 0, so that\n(1.25)\n\n(1.23) is not a strictly hyperbolic system,\n\nand indeed it is uniformly degenerate. In view of (1.25), application of classic theory\nof hyperbolic systems (see [2, 5]), which recently got a fundamental progress, is not\npossible. In any case, it is worth recalling that formation of singularities for (1.23) or (1.19)\nand possible extensions of blow-up solutions beyond singularities remain the key (and\nabsolutely unavoidable for any difficult nonlinear PDE model) question to be addressed\nin what follows.\nRegardless such nice local regularity and analyticity properties of the PDE (1.19), our\nmain goal is to show that (1.19) admits rather standard \"quasi-stationary\" self-similar\nshock waves (Section 2) and other blow-up singularities (Section 3). In Section 4, following\nthe strategy in [9], we develop a local theory of formation of shock waves from continuous\ndata and show that the PDE (1.19) admits a unique similarity continuation after blow-up.\nIn other words, this implies that uniqueness is not lost locally at the singularity blow-up\npoints, and this links (1.19) with the classic model (1.7). However, a proper definition\nof entropy solutions to create a global existence-uniqueness theory for (1.19) remains a\ndifficult open problem (it is not clear if such one can be developed in principle).\n1.3. On blow-up similarity solutions with swirl. Let us for a while return to the\nfull boxed system in (1.12), which is a difficult object, so we truly and desperately need\na simplified model. For instance, in general, (1.12) admits complicated singular solutions\nwith blow-up angular swirl. For the NSEs and EEs, such a mechanism was proposed in [7],\nso we omit details, and prescribe those similarity solutions as follows: for fixed \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1)\nand \u03c3 \u2208 R,\n(1.26)\n\nU(r, \u03c6, t) = (\u2212t)\u2212\u03b1 f (y, \u03bc),\ny=\n\nr\n,\n(\u2212t)\u03b2\n\n\u03b2 = 1 \u2212 \u03b1,\n\nV (r, \u03c6, t) = (\u2212t)\u22121 g(y, \u03bc),\n\n\u03bc = \u03c6 + \u03c3 ln(\u2212t),\n\nwhere we introduce blow-up rotation in the angular direction being a logarithmic travelling\nwave. Substituting (1.26) into (1.12) yields the following first-order system:\n\u001a\n\u03b1f + \u03b2fy\u2032 y \u2212 \u03c3f\u03bc\u2032 = f g\u03bc\u2032 ,\n(1.27)\ng + \u03b2gy\u2032 y \u2212 \u03c3g\u03bc\u2032 = gfy\u2032 .\nThis is a difficult system, which we do not intent to study it here, though indeed some its\nfeatures will be detected for a reduced simpler PDE model in (1.19).\n5\n\n\f2.

Similar to (1.8), we look for blow-up\nsimilarity solutions of (1.19) of the form\n\u0001\n\u2032 2\n\u2032\nf \u2032y \u2032\nx\n, where\n+ ff = (ff) .\n(2.1)\nu\u2212 (x, t) = f (y), y = (\u2212t)\ny\n\nThe ODE in (2.1) can be easily reduced to the following one:\n(2.2)\n\nyf f \u2032\u2032 = (f \u2032 )2 (y + f ) \u2212 2f f \u2032,\n\nf (\u00b1\u221e) = \u00b11,\n\nwhich is degenerate at y = 0 and at any zero f = 0 of solutions. Note that, unlike\n(1.8), the conditions at infinity have been changed, so that (2.1) is supposed to deliver\nthe opposite shock:\nlimt\u21920\u2212 u\u2212 (x, t) = S+ (x) \u2261 sign x.\n\n(2.3)\n\nIn view of the obvious symmetry of (2.2):\n\u001a\ny 7\u2192 \u2212y,\n(2.4)\nf 7\u2192 \u2212f\n\nit suffices to solve the following problem:\n(2.5)\n\nyf f \u2032\u2032 = (f \u2032 )2 (y + f ) \u2212 2f f \u2032\n\nfor y > 0;\n\nf (0) = 0, f (+\u221e) = 1.\n\nRecall that according to (1.17) we have to check the sign of\nut\nu\n\n(2.6)\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2261 (\u2212t)\u22121 ffy > 0\n\nwhich is true if f (y) > 0 and f \u2032 (y) > 0 for all y > 0. Here, (2.5) is a pretty standard\nsecond-order ODE, so we state the final result:\nTheorem 2.1. The problem (2.5) admits a unique C 2 ([0, \u221e)) strictly monotone solution.\nProof. It consists of a few steps. (i) Scaling invariance. One can see that (2.5) admits a\ngroup of scalings: if f1 (y) is a solution,\n\u0001\n(2.7)\nthen fa (y) = af1 ay\nis a solution for any a 6= 0.\n\n(ii) Finite regularity at y = 0. This can be seen by (still formal) expansion near the origin\n(2.8)\n\nf (y) = y + \u03b5(y),\n\nwhere \u03b5(y) = o(y) as y \u2192 0.\n\nSubstituting (2.8) into the ODE (2.5) and \"linearizing\" yields the following Euler's ODE:\n(2.9)\n\ny 2\u03b5\u2032\u2032 \u2212 2y\u03b5\u2032 + \u03b5 = 0\n\n=\u21d2\n\n\u03b5(y) = y m\u00b1 ,\n\nwhere m\u00b1 =\n\n\u221a\n3\u00b1 5\n.\n2\n\nSince we are looking for sufficiently smooth and at least classical solutions of the PDE\n(1.19), we have to choose the maximal exponent\n(2.10)\n\nm = m+ =\n\n\u221a\n3+ 5\n2\n\n= 2.61803... \u2208 (2, 3) (m\u2212 = 0.38197... < 1).\n\nThe justification of the expansion (2.8), (2.9) is performed in a standard manner by\nreducing the ODE to the equivalent integral equations for y = y(f ) (this deletes the trivial\n6\n\n\fShock wave profiles\n\nf(y)=y\n\n20\n18\nA>0: blow\u2212up\n16\n14\n\nf(y)\n\n12\n10\n8\nA<0: shock profiles\n\n6\n4\n2\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\ny\nFigure 1. Various solutions of the ODE (2.5) with the expansion (2.11) for\ndifferent values of A > 0.\n\nsolution f \u2261 0) and applying Banach's Contraction Principle with a suitable weighted\nfunctional setting.\nThus, (2.5) admits a 1D bundle of solutions close to the origin:\n(2.11)\n\nf (y) = y + Ay m + o(y m) for y > 0,\n\nwhere A \u2208 R is arbitrary. For A = 0, we have the exact unbounded solution\n(2.12)\n\nf0 (y) = y.\n\nIt follows from the symmetry (2.4) that the extension of the shock profiles for y < 0 is:\n(2.13)\n\nf (y) = y + A|y|m\u22121y + o(|y|m) for y < 0.\n\nThe parameter A < 0 makes it possible to shoot the necessary constant +1 at infinity,\nwhich is rather standard and we omit details. \u0003\nActually, some necessary properties of solutions of (2.5) can be easily checked numerically by using a standard MatLab solvers such as the ode45, and this diminishes the\nnecessity of a deeper mathematical study. In Figure 1, we show the monotone dependence on A < 0 and A > 0 of solutions of (2.5) with the expansion (2.11). For A > 0,\nthe local solutions f (y) blow-up in finite y0 > 0 that is also easily proved. Note that\nfor A < 0, according to (1.21), the behaviour in {y > 0} of similarity solutions (2.1) are\nlocally governed by a well-posed parabolic flow with a blow-up formation of a shock wave\nin finite time.\nThe next Figure 2 demonstrates a general view of similarity shock profiles for both\ny > 0 and y < 0.

Namely, we now shoot from y = \u221250 with\nthe following asymptotic expansion of the solutions about the equilibrium f = 1:\n(2.15)\n\nf (y) = 1 +\n\nB\ny\n\n+ ... as y \u2192 \u2212\u221e.\n\nWe now use the ode45 solver with the fully enhanced relative and absolute tolerances\nTols = 10\u221213 .\n\n(2.16)\n\nFor B < 0, we observe that the solutions pass though the singular point y = 0 and\nconverge to another larger equilibrium,\n(2.17)\n\nf (y) \u2192 f+\n\nas y \u2192 +\u221e,\n\nwhere f+ = f+ (B) > 1.\n\nNote that possible singularities at y = 0 are integrable since even in the worst case the\nsolution is bounded,\nf \u2032\u2032 \u223c\n\n1\ny\n\n=\u21d2\n\nf (y) \u223c C + y ln |y| + ... as y \u2192 0,\n\nor the regularity is better, when the right-hand side in (2.5) vanishes at y = 0 (this case\nactually occurs to give good solutions).\nA different phenomenon is observed for B > 0, where the shock profiles seem have\nfinite interfaces at some y = y0 < 0. However, next Figure 4 explains that this is wrong:\nthought (a) with the enlargement 10\u22123 continues to convince existence of negative finite\ninterfaces, (b) given in the logarithmic scale confirms that the solutions have exponential\n8\n\n\fdecay up to y = 0\u2212 . Some lines in (b) are disjoint for profiles |f (y)| \u223c 10\u221217 , which\nsuddenly change sign due to numerical errors (recall the guaranteed accuracy (2.16)).\nNamely, a more careful look at the equation (2.5) shows that it admits solutions with the\nfollowing typical non-analytic behaviour:\na\n\u2212 (\u2212y)\n\n(2.18)\n\nf (y) \u223c e\n\n\u2192 0 as y \u2192 0\u2212 ,\n\nwhere a > 0 is arbitrary due to the scaling symmetry (2.7).\nSuch solutions admit a natural trivial extension by f (y) \u2261 0 for y \u2265 0, thus forming\n\u221e\nC shock wave solutions with finite interfaces. Taking such a profile f (y), instead of\n(1.9), we get in the limit the reflected Heaviside function:\n\u001a\n0 for x \u2265 0,\n(2.19)\nlim\u2212 u\u2212 (x, t) = H(\u2212x) =\n1 for x < 0.\nt\u21920\n\nIt is principal to note that, due to the regularity (2.18) at the interface, the similarity\nsolution (2.1) is a C \u221e function for t < 0. In other words, (2.19) describes formation of a\nshock wave as t \u2192 0\u2212 from classic C \u221e solutions. Such an evolution process of formation\nof shocks can be taken as a core property for introducing a test on the so-called \u03b4-entropy\nsolutions, i.e., those which are obtained via smooth deformation of shocks appeared. See\n[6, 8, 10], where such an approach is developed for nonlinear dispersion equations such as\n(2.20)\n\nut = (uux )xx\n\nand ut = \u2212(uux )xxxx .\n\nClassic concepts of entropy do not apply to (2.20), so other approaches are needed. On the\nother hand, a detailed pointwise analysis of formation of gradient blow-up for PDEs such\nas (2.20) shows that uniqueness is violated there, so a consistent entropy theory is most\nplausibly non-existent in principle; see [9]. Deeper evolution and entropy-like properties\nof such finite interface solutions are out of the scope of this paper. Let us mention that\nthe questions on weak compactly supported solutions are in the focus of modern research\nin the EEs area; see [1, p. 418].\n2.2. Existence of rarefaction waves. The corresponding rarefaction waves describe\ncollapse of initial singularities. The similarity ones then are defined for all t > 0:\n(2.21)\n\nu+ (x, t) = F (y),\n\ny = xt ,\n\nyF F \u2032\u2032 = (F \u2032)2 (y \u2212 F ) \u2212 2F F \u2032 ,\n\nF (\u00b1\u221e) = \u22131.\n\nIt follows that, in comparison with the shock profiles F (y) constructed above, the rarefaction ones are given by the reflection:\n(2.22)\n\n\u2212 F (y) is a solution of the rarefaction ODE (2.21).\n\nTherefore, the similarity solution in (2.21) is formed by the initial singularity S\u2212 (x) =\n\u2212sign x and describes its evolution collapse for t > 0.\nSimilarly, for data u(x, 0) = \u2212H(\u2212x), we obtain similarity solution (2.21) describing\nits collapse. To get a unique solution, two initial functions should be prescribed. It is\neasy to see that ut (x, 0) is not a distribution. Indeed, we have, according to (2.21) and\nasymptotics (2.15), (2.18), in the sense of distributions, it is formally valid that\nR\n(2.23) ut (x, t) = \u2212 1t F \u2032 (y)y \u2192 a0 \u03b4(x) as t \u2192 0+ , where a0 = \u2212 F \u2032 (y)y dy > 0.\n9\n\n\fNon\u2212symmetric profiles for B>0 and B<0\n6\nB=\u22122\n5\nB<0\n\nf(y)\n\n4\n\n3\nB=\u22120.2\n2\n\n1\nB>0\nB=2\n0\n\u221212\n\n\u221210\n\n\u22128\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\n2\n\ny\nFigure 3.

Enlarged shock profiles for B > 0: exponential decay as y \u2192 0\u2212 .\nHowever, in view of the asymptotics (2.15), the integral in (2.23) diverges, so that ut (x, 0)\nis not a bounded positive measure. In the sense of distributions, such a behaviour can be\ncharacterized by a logarithmic divergence as follows:\n(2.24)\n\nut (x, t) = \u2212 1t F \u2032 (y)y \u223c B| ln t| \u03b4(x) as t \u2192 0+ ,\n10\n\nso\n\nut\n(x, 0)\n| ln t|\n\nis a measure.\n\n\f3. Unbounded shocks by similarity blow-up and rarefaction profiles\nMore complicated shock-type structure occurs if in (2.1) we introduce a parameter\n\u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) looking for similarity solutions (cf. (1.26))\n(3.1)\n\nu\u2212 (x, t) = (\u2212t)\u2212\u03b1 f (y),\n\ny=\n\nx\n(\u2212t)\u03b2\n\nfor t < 0,\n\nwhere \u03b2 = 1 \u2212 \u03b1,\n\nand f (y) then solves the following more complicated ODE:\n(3.2)\n\n\u03b2 2 y 2f f \u2032\u2032 = \u03b2y(f \u2032)2 (\u03b2y + f ) + \u03b2(\u03b1 \u2212 2)yf f \u2032 + \u03b1f 2(f \u2032 \u2212 1) in R.\n\nUsing the same symmetry (2.4), we again pose the anti-symmetry condition at the origin\n(3.3)\n\nf (0) = 0\n\n=\u21d2\n\nf (\u2212y) \u2261 \u2212f (y).\n\nIn view of (1.17), we have to require that\nut\nu\n\n(3.4)\n\n\u2261 (\u2212t)\u2212\u03b1\u22121 \u03b1f +\u03b2f\nf\n\n\u2032y\n\n> 0,\n\nwhich for (3.2) can be also checked by a Maximum Principle approach. One can see that\nthis means that ut > 0 for x > 0 implying a monotone in time growth of blow-up solutions\n(a typical feature of parabolic equations, see (1.21)). By a similar shooting technique, we\nprove the following analogy of Theorem 2.1, which includes all necessary asymptotics of\nblow-up profiles:\nTheorem 3.1. The problem (3.2), (3.3) admits a family of solutions f (y) > 0 for y > 0\nsatisfying for any A < 0:\n\u221a\n2\u03b12 \u22124\u03b1+3\u00b1 (2\u03b12 \u22124\u03b1+3)2 \u22124(1\u2212\u03b1)4\n(3.5)\nf (y) = y + Ay m+ + ... as y \u2192 0+ , m\u00b1 =\n;\n2(1\u2212\u03b1)2\n(3.6)\n\n\u03b1\n\nf (y) = C0 y \u2212 1\u2212\u03b1 + ... \u2192 0+\n\nas y \u2192 +\u221e,\n\nwhere C0 = C0 (A) > 0.\n\nLet us note that the linearization (2.8) now leads to the equation\n(3.7)\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03b1)2 y 2\u03b5\u2032\u2032 \u2212 (\u03b12 \u2212 2\u03b1 + 2)y\u03b5\u2032 + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)2 \u03b5 = 0,\n\nwhence the same solutions with the exponents m\u00b1 given in (3.5).\nIt follows that (3.1) is an unbounded blow-up solution that forms as t \u2192 0\u2212 the following\nsingular final time profile (cf.

We then again arrive at a difficult question on the\ncorrect entropy-like choice of proper solutions, which reveal some remnants of those ones\nfor the EEs (1.1) and hyperbolic systems such as (1.3). Hopefully, an evolution entropy\ntest then can be developed in lines of smooth \u03b4-deformations as in [6, 8, 10]. However,\nthere are examples of higher-order PDEs, for which any entropy-like unique extension of\na solution after singularity is principally impossible (there are infinitely many extensions\nthat are all equally allowed), [9]. We do not know whether such negative trends can be\noriented to the EEs (1.1).\n4. Uniqueness of a local continuation after gradient blow-up\nWe now need to consider the principal question on a generic (self-similar) mechanism\nof formation of shocks for the model (1.19). To this end, following [9], we will use the\nsame similarity solutions (3.1), but now with\n(4.1)\n\n\u03b1<0\n\n=\u21d2\n\n\u03b2 = 1 \u2212 \u03b1 \u2261 1 + |\u03b1| > 1,\n\n|\u03b1|\n\u03b2\n\nso that\n\n\u2261\n\n|\u03b1|\n1+|\u03b1|\n\n< 1.\n\nIt can be shown that such solutions (3.1) create continuous \"initial data\" (cf. (3.8))\n(\n|\u03b1|\nC0 x 1+|\u03b1|\nfor x > 0,\n\u2212\n(4.2)\nu\u2212 (x, 0 ) =\n|\u03b1|\n\u2212C0 |x| 1+|\u03b1| for x < 0,\n\nwhere C0 > 0 is some (actually arbitrary by scaling (2.7)) constant. Note that (4.2) is\nstill continuous at x = 0 but has a first gradient blow-up there.\nThe question is how to extend the data (4.2) for t > 0. This is naturally done by\nusing the global similarity solution (3.9). Unlike the previous cases, we here assume that\na shock occurs at y = 0, i.e., we put two conditions there\n(4.3)\n\nF (0) = F0 > 0 and F \u2032 (0) = F1 .\n\nBy a rather standard local analysis of the ODE (3.9) at y = 0, it is not difficult to conclude\nthat the Cauchy problem (4.3) has a unique smooth solution in the only case\n(4.4)\n\nF \u2032 (0) = F1 = \u22121\n\n=\u21d2\n\nF (y) = F0 \u2212 y +\n\n\u03b2 2 y2\n2\u03b1F0\n\n+ ... .\n\nFor other values of F \u2032 (0) 6= \u22121, the solution is not smooth and is singular at y = 0. All\nsuch singular bundles can be also derived. Therefore, the behaviour of solution F (y) as\ny \u2192 0+ is very unstable and, even numerically, its construction is not straightforward.\nBefore stating the main result, we present in Figure 7 such global similarity profiles\nF (y) for various values of \u03b1 \u2208 [\u22121, \u22120.1]. Since the non-monotonicity of F (y) is not\nvisible here at all, in the next Figure 8, we show typical shape of such profiles in the\nCauchy problem posed for y > \u03b4 = 0.1, with F (\u03b4) = 1 and various F \u2032 (\u03b4) < 0. Note that\nthe absolute minimum points at some y = y0 > 0 perfectly corresponds to the Maximum\nPrinciple for the ODE (3.9). Indeed, one has:\n(4.5)\n\nF \u2032 (y0 ) = 0, F (y0 ) > 0\n\n=\u21d2\n\n\u03b2 2 y02 F (y0)F \u2032\u2032 (y0 ) = |\u03b1|F 2 (y0 ) > 0.\n13\n\n\fGlobal extension profile F(y) for F =1, F =\u22121: \u03b1 =\u22120.1,..., \u22121\n0\n\n1\n\n10\n9\n8\n\n\u03b1=\u22121\n\n7\n\nF(y)\n\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n\u03b1=\u22120.1\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\ny\nFigure 7.

Typical non-monotone solutions of the ODE (3.9), (4.4) for \u03b1 = \u22120.5.\nBy checking the asymptotic properties of solutions of (3.9) as y \u2192 +\u221e, it is not difficult\nto see that all the profiles with the expansion (4.4), which do not vanish by the Maximum\nPrinciple shown in (4.5), exhibit the desired behaviour at infinity:\n(4.6)\n\n|\u03b1|\n\nF (y) = Cy 1+|\u03b1| (1 + o(1)) as y \u2192 +\u221e.\n14\n\n\fHere C is a positive constant but not necessarily the one C0 obtained in (4.2) by the\nblow-up limit. However, the transition C 7\u2192 C0 is uniquely done by the scaling invariance\n(2.7), so we arrive at:\nProposition 4.1. For given initial data (4.2), there exists a unique similarity profile F (y)\nsuch that the global similarity solution (3.9) satisfies\n(4.7)\n\nu\u2212 (x, 0\u2212 ) = u+ (x, 0+ )\n\nin R.\n\nWe call the corresponding profiles {f, F } a similarity global extension pair. Thus, this\npair is always unique, so the self-similar blow-up solution u\u2212 (x, t) for t < 0 has a unique\nextension via the similarity one u+ (x, t) for t > 0.\nThis justifies a kind of \"micro-local\" uniqueness theory of shock wave solutions for the\nPDE (1.19), which sounds rather optimistic. Existence, or even a possibility of construction, of a global \"entropy-like\" theory for (1.19) (say, in Oleinik\u2013Kruzhkov\u2013Lax\u2013Glimm\u2013\nBressan\u2013etc. sense) is quite questionable still. In any case, the above \"micro-uniqueness\"\nresult is rather inspiring bearing in mind that this could affect some similar extension\nproperties of the EEs.\n5. Final conclusions: towards the full model of (r, \u03c6)-shock and blow-up\nformation\nThe integral equation (1.15) assumes another mechanism of shock formation for data:\n(5.1)\n\nV0\u03c6 \u2248 0 and V0 \u2248 1.\n\nThen the second term dominates and, on two differentiations, this leads to the PDE:\ni\nh\nUr\u03c6\n.\n(5.2)\nUr\u03c6 = U Ut \u0001\nt\n\u2212\nU\nr\nUt U t\n\nThis equation is supposed to describe more complicated phenomena of shock and more\ngeneral blow-up formation, where both independent variables (r, \u03c6) are essentially and\nequally involved. Of course, (5.2) is uncomparably more difficult than (1.19), and seems\ncan give a deeper insight into weak and strong singularity formation for the EEs (and\nalso for (1.3)) in the actual 2D {r, \u03c6}-geometry. We do not study this equation here.\nNevertheless, it should be mentioned that equations such as (5.2) and others must be\ncarefully investigated and understood before any serious attack of singularity phenomena\nfor Euler equations in 2D and, especially, 3D, which will indeed require other hierarchy\nof some reduced PDE models to introduce and study.\nReferences\n[1] C.
