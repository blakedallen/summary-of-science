We identify their homotopy type with the infinite loop spaces associated\nwith certain Thom spectra.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe concept of a cobordism category emerged from the works of Atiyah [2] and\nSegal [27] to define topological and conformal field theories respectively. Broadly\nspeaking, a cobordism category is a category where the objects are given by closed\nmanifolds and the morphisms are cobordisms between them. The cobordism categories that appear in the definition of a topological field theory are only concerned\nwith the topological type of the relevant manifolds, so they are ordinary categories.\nOn the other hand, the cobordism category of Riemann surfaces M that was introduced in [27] is a topological category that has as objects the non-negative integers\nand the morphism spaces are given by the moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces. The\nauthors of [12] defined a topological cobordism category Cd of d-dimensional smooth\nmanifolds by considering smooth cobordisms embedded in some arbitrarily high dimensional Euclidean space. The choice of the (unparametrised) embedding induces\nthe topology on these cobordism categories and its homotopy type is given by the\nhomotopy type of the classifying spaces of the diffeomorphism groups of the corresponding smooth manifolds. Then their classifying spaces may be regarded as certain kinds of moduli spaces of manifolds that encode information that is stable with\nrespect to extending by cobordisms. The homotopy type of the d-dimensional embedded cobordism category, along with its variations that are specified by a choice\nof a tangential structure, was determined in [12]. In the oriented 2-dimensional\ncase, this led to a new proof of Mumford's conjecture on the cohomology of the\nstable mapping class group of orientable surfaces.\nThis paper is concerned with the homotopy type of the classifying spaces of\ncertain subcategories Ag,d of M and the associated ordinary cobordism categories\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 57N70, 57R50, 55N22, 55P99, 55R12.\nKey words and phrases.

For every d > 1 and g > 0, the cobordism\ncategory Ag,d is a model for the subcategory of M that has the same objects but\nit only contains Riemann surfaces each of whose connected components is either\nhomeomorphic to the cylinder S 1 \u00d7I with one incoming and one outgoing boundary\ncomponent or the surface \u03a3g,d of genus g with d boundary components that are\nall incoming. This is a natural choice of a subcategory of (the positive boundary\nsubcategory of) M that isolates the contribution of a single genus g, while the\nparameter d functions as a decoration. Our main result about the homotopy type\nof BAg,d says that there is a homotopy fiber sequence\n(1.1)\n\nQBDiff + (\u03a3(d)\ng )+ \u2192 QBSO(2)+ \u2192 BAg,d\n\nwhere the first map is induced by the evaluation of the differential of a diffeomor(d)\nphism at d marked points. Here Diff + (\u03a3g ) is the topological group of orientationpreserving diffeomorphisms of a closed orientable surface of genus g with d marked\npoints that are allowed to permute.\nThe cobordism category Ad is the category of connected components of Ag,d\n(this is clearly independent of g). It is a subcategory of the cobordism category of\norientable surfaces up to homeomorphism. We show that there is a homotopy fiber\nsequence\n(1.2)\n\nQB\u03a3d+ \u2192 QS 0 \u2192 BAd\n\n0\nwhere the first map is induced by the natural map B\u03a3d \u2192 B\u03a3+\n\u221e \u2243 Qd S . Here\n0\n0\nQd S is the connected component of QS of the map with degree d.\nIntuitively, we may regard the cobordism categories Ag,d and Ad as admitting\na presentation with generators given by the isomorphisms and relations that are\ngenerated by the space of morphisms from d to 0. Then one can interpret these\nhomotopy fiber sequences as resolutions of the cobordism categories Ag,d and Ad\nby the free infinite loop spaces generated respectively by the generators and the\nrelations in the presentation.\nTwo cases of special interest are the topological cobordism category of complex\nannuli A0,2 and the ordinary cobordism category of its connected components A2 .\nThe category of complex annuli appeared in the work of Costello [8] in connection\nwith the homotopy type of the compactified moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces. In\nthis case, the homotopy fiber sequence (1.1) can be written as follows,\n\nQBO(2)+ \u2192 QBSO(2)+ \u2192 BA2\nand the first map is the stable transfer map associated with the double covering (up\nto homotopy) BSO(2) \u2192 BO(2). On the other hand, the cobordism category A2\nwill be seen to be homotopy equivalent with the positive boundary 1-dimensional\nembedded cobordism category C1,\u2202 of [12]. For d = 2, the homotopy fiber sequence\n(1.2) can be written as follows,\nQRP+\u221e \u2192 QS 0 \u2192 BA2\nand the first map is the stable transfer map associated with the universal double\ncovering. As a consequence, we can identify the homotopy type of these two cobordism categories with the infinite loop spaces of the Thom spectra associated with\nthe stable bundles that are inverse to the relevant line bundles, i.e., there are weak\n\n\fON THE HOMOTOPY TYPE OF CERTAIN COBORDISM CATEGORIES OF SURFACES\n\n3\n\nhomotopy equivalences\n\u2243\n\nBA0,2 \u2192 \u03a9\u221e\u22121 Th(\u2212\u03b42 ),\n\u2243\n\nBA2 \u2192 \u03a9\u221e\u22121 Th(\u2212\u03b31 ).\nHere \u03b42 denotes the determinant line bundle associated with the double covering\nBSO(2) \u2192 BO(2) and \u03b31 is the universal line bundle.

By a similar argument, we show that this is true\n+ \u2243\nalso in the oriented 1-dimensional case, i.e.. the inclusion BC1,\u2202\n\u2192 BC1+ is a weak\nhomotopy equivalence. The analogous results have been shown in all higher dimensions in [12].\nOrganisation of the paper. In section 2, we discuss the homotopy theory of the\nclassifying spaces of categories and develop the general method that will be needed\nin showing the existence of the homotopy fiber sequences. This part of the paper\nis independent of the context of cobordism categories and so the results are also\nof independent interest. However we have restricted to a generality that will be\nsufficient for the purpose of proving our main results. Further details and natural\ngeneralisations will be discussed in the appendix. In section 3, we study the homotopy type of the ordinary cobordism categories Ad and prove the homotopy fiber\nsequence (1.2). In section 4, we show that the category A2 is homotopy equivalent\nwith the positive boundary 1-dimensional embedded cobordism category C1,\u2202 of\n[12]. Using results from [12], we then prove the weak homotopy equivalence (1.3)\nand its analogue in the oriented case. In section 5, we study the homotopy type of\nthe topological cobordism categories Ag,d and prove the homotopy fiber sequence\n(1.1). For technical reasons, we will work with mapping class groups instead of\ndiffeomorphism groups of surfaces whenever the values of g and d are so that the\ncomponents of the diffeomorphism groups are contractible.\n2.

The first weak homotopy equivalence is clear. For the second, the proof is\nexactly the same as for Thomason's well-known homotopy colimit theorem [29].\n(A little explanation about where the technical conditions on C come in here.\nThe condition that ObC is discrete\nQ is required so that, for any choice of objects\nc0 , c1 , ..., cp \u2208 ObC, the space 06i6p\u22121 MorC (ci , ci+1 ) defines a connected component of Np C. This condition is not strictly necessary, but it will suffice for our\npurposes here. The cofibration condition on C is a standard requirement in order\nto deal with classifying spaces in a good way as in [25, Appendix A].).\n\u0003\nTherefore any of these constructions gives an equally good model for the homotopy colimit of a diagram of topological categories. The advantage of the\nGrothendieck construction is that it produces again a topological category rather\nthan a simplicial or topological space. The results of this section will be stated in\nterms of the Grothendieck construction, however we will not insist on distinguishing\nbetween the models in later sections.\nA morphism F : D1 \u2192 D2 in Cat(T op) is called a weak equivalence if B(F )\nis a weak homotopy equivalence in T op.

Note that the little comma category c \u2193C c\u2032 is the\ntransport category associated to the right action of EndC (c) on the space C(c, c\u2032 ).\nThere is a functor\nR\n/ EndC (c)\nU (c) : C Fc\nthat forgets the objects and takes every morphism to the associated endomorphism\nof c.\nR\nLemma 2.2.1. The functor U (c) : C Fc \u2192 EndC (c) is a weak equivalence, i.e., it\ninduces a (weak) homotopy equivalence\nR\n\u2243 /\nu(c) : B( C Fc )\nBEndC (c).\nWe will give two proofs of Lemma 2.2.1.\nFirst Proof. Let X\u2217\u2217 denote the Bousfield-Kan homotopy colimit of the diagram\nN Fc : C \u2192 sT op. A (p, q)-simplex is a pair\n(c0 \u2192 ... \u2192 cp \u2208 Np C, c \u2192 ... \u2192 c \u2192 c0 \u2208 Nq (c \u2193C c0 ))\nand the face and degeneracy maps are given by composition and insertion of identities respectively. The only non-obvious face map is the following:\nf1\n\n\u03b1q\n\nf1 f \u03b1q\n\nf\n\nd0 \u00d7 dq (c0 \u2192 ... \u2192 cp , c \u2192 ... \u2192 c \u2192 c0 ) = (c1 \u2192 ... \u2192 cp , c \u2192 ... \u2212\u2192 c1 ).\nR\nBy Proposition 2.1.1, there is a weak homotopy equivalence \u03b8 : |X\u2217\u2217 | \u2192 B( C Fc ).\nWe claim that there is also a weak homotopy equivalence \u03c8 : |X\u2217\u2217 | \u2192 BEndC (c).\nLet Y\u2217\u2217 be a bisimplicial space whose (p, q)-simplices are the pairs\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1q\n\n(c \u2192 c0 \u2192 ... \u2192 cp , c \u21921 ... \u2192 c)\n\n\f6\n\nGEORGE RAPTIS\n\nand the face and degeneracy maps are such that the maps\n\u03b2pq : Xpq \u2192 Ypq\nf1\n\n\u03b1q\n\nf\n\nf\n\nf1\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1q\n\n(c0 \u2192 ... \u2192 cp , c \u2192 ... \u2192 c \u2192 c0 ) 7\u2192 (c \u2192 c0 \u2192 ... \u2192 cp , c \u21921 ... \u2192 c)\ndefine an isomorphism of bisimplicial spaces. Let N EndC (c) be the the nerve of\nEndC (c) considered as a bisimplicial space that is constant in one direction and\nconsider the projection on the q-direction \u03c8 : Y\u2217\u2217 \u2192 N EndC (c). If we realise\nwith respect to the p-direction, we obtain a map of simplicial spaces that is given\nlevelwise by the projections\nB(c \u2193 C) \u00d7 Nq EndC (c) \u2192 Nq EndC (c).\nSince the category c \u2193 C has an initial object, its classifying space is contractible\nand so the projections are homotopy equivalences. Therefore the bisimplicial map\n\u03c8 is a weak homotopy equivalence. It can be checked easily that the map u(c)\u03b8 is\nhomotopic to \u03c8. Hence it follows that u(c) is a weak homotopy equivalence.\n\u0003\nR\nSecond Proof. There is a functor G : EndC (c) \u2192 C Fc defined as follows: the\nunique object of EndC (c) is sent to (c, 1c ), and an endomorphism \u03c3 : c \u2192 c is sent\nto (\u03c3, \u03c3), i.e., the morphism\n\u03c3 /\nc\nc\n1\n\n1\n\n\u000f \u03c3 \u000f\n/c\nc\nThen we have U G = 1, and therefore (BU )(BG) = 1. Furthermore, the pair (G, U )\ndefines an continuous adjunction. In particular, there is a natural transformation\nR\n\u03c1 : GU \u2192 1 whose components are defined as follows: given (c\u2032 , \u03b1) \u2208 Ob C Fc , \u03c1c\nis (\u03b1, 1c ), i.e., the morphism represented by the diagram\n1\n\nc\n\n\u03b1\n\n1\n\n\u000f\nc\n\n/c\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u000f\n/ c\u2032\n\nIt is well-known that a natural transformation of functors induces a homotopy\nbetween the maps of classifying spaces (e.g. see [23]). Therefore (BG)(BU ) \u2243 1,\nand the result follows.\n\u0003\nRemark 2.2.2. Lemma 2.2.1 may be compared with the classical Yoneda lemma of\ncategory theory (see also Proposition A.1.2). The Yoneda lemma says that, for any\n(ordinary, locally small) category C, the canonical functor Y : C op \u2192 F un(C, Set),\ndefined on objects by c 7\u2192 (c\u2032 7\u2192HomC (c, c\u2032 )), is fully faithful. As a consequence, if\ntwo representable functors are naturally isomorphic then they are represented by\nisomorphic objects. The functor Fc may be regarded as a topological extension of\nthe representable functor represented by c \u2208 ObC. Lemma 2.2.1 implies that two\nsuch functors are weakly equivalent only if the elements that represent them have\nweakly equivalent endomorphism monoids.\nRemark 2.2.3. When C is an ordinary small category, Lemma 2.2.1 can be seen\nas an application of Thomason's theorem [29] and the following central idea from\nQuillen's Theorem B [20]. This says that, given a morphism F : C \u2192 D in Cat,\nthe canonical map hocolimd\u2208D B(C \u2193 d) \u2192 BC is a weak homotopy equivalence.\n\n\fON THE HOMOTOPY TYPE OF CERTAIN COBORDISM CATEGORIES OF SURFACES\n\n7\n\nThe last lemma is an application of this statement to the inclusion EndC (c) \u2192 C.\nNote that the second proof actually shows that the map u(c) is always a homotopy\nequivalence, and not just a weak one.\n2.3. Stability. While a morphism \u03b1 : c\u2032 \u2192 c always induces a function Ob(c \u2193C\nd) \u2192 Ob(c\u2032 \u2193C d) which is natural in d, it is not true that this function extends\ncanonically to a functor. In other words, there is no canonical way to choose a\nnatural transformation Fc \u2192 Fc\u2032 for every morphism c\u2032 \u2192 c.\nA natural transformation \u03b7 : Fc \u2192 Fc\u2032 is uniquely specified by the following data\n(see Proposition A.1.2): a morphism \u03b1 : c\u2032 \u2192 c and a continuous homomorphism h :\nEndC (c) \u2192 EndC (c\u2032 ) between topological monoids with the compatibility condition\nthat\nh(\u03c3)\n/ c\u2032\nc\u2032\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u000f\n\u000f\n\u03c3\n/c\nc\ncommutes for all \u03c3 \u2208 EndC (c). The morphism \u03b1 comes from the Yoneda lemma\nand the homomorphism h is determined by \u03b7 as follows:\nh(\u03c3)\n\n\u03c3\n\n\u03b7c (\u03c3 \u2192 1c ) = (\u03c3 \u25e6 \u03b1) \u2212\u2192 (1c \u25e6 \u03b1).\n\u03b1\n\nDefinition 2.3.1. Say that C stabilises along a subcategory J if for every j \u2192\nj \u2032 in J , there is a continuous assignment of a continuous homomorphism \u03b1\u2217 :\nEndC (j \u2032 ) \u2192 EndC (j) such that\n(i) the square\n\u03b1\u2217 (\u03c3)\n\nj\n\u03b1\n\n\u000f\nj\u2032\n\n/j\n\u03b1\n\n\u03c3\n\n\u000f\n/ j\u2032\n\ncommutes for all \u03c3 \u2208 EndC (j \u2032 ),\n(ii) (\u03b2\u03b1)\u2217 = \u03b1\u2217 \u03b2 \u2217 and 1\u2217 = 1.\nExample 2.3.2. Let C be a (strict) symmetric monoidal category with unit object\n1. Every morphism f : c \u2192 1 in C generates a subcategory I(f ) of C defined to be\nthe smallest subcategory that contains the morphisms 1\u2297(n\u22121) \u2297 f : c\u2297n \u2192 c\u2297n\u22121 .\nLet Endn (c) denote the monoid of endomorphisms of the object c\u2297n . For every\nn > 1, there is a homomorphism Endn (c) \u2192 Endn+1 (c) given by tensoring with the\nidentity 1c : c \u2192 c. Then it is easy to see that C stabilises along I(f ) for every such\nf . This is the main example and it covers all the cases that we will be interested\nin.\nSuppose that C stabilises along a subcategory J . Then there is a functor\nJ op \u00d7 C \u2192 Cat(T op) that is defined on objects by (j, c) 7\u2192 j \u2193C c. Applying\nthe Grothendieck construction with respect to J op , we obtain a functor\nGJ : C \u2192 Cat(T op)\nwhich is defined on objects by\nR\nR\nc 7\u2192 J op (\u2212 \u2193C c) = J op F\u2212 (c).\n\n\f8\n\nGEORGE RAPTIS\n\nDefinition 2.3.3. Suppose that C stabilises along a subcategory J . Say that C is\nHZ-stable along J if for every morphism u : c \u2192 c\u2032 in C, the map BGJ (u) is an\nintegral homology equivalence.\nSimilarly we can define W-stability with respect to any class of weak equivalences\nW in T op. The corresponding theory for more general classes W will be sketched\nin the appendix.\ni\n\np\n\nDefinition 2.3.4. Let F \u2192 E \u2192 B be a sequence of maps together with a homotopy from the composite pi to the constant map at b \u2208 B. Say that it is a homology\nfiber sequence if the canonical map F \u2192 hofiberb (p) is an integral homology equivalence.\nIn the following results of the section, we also assume that the space MorC is\nlocally contractible and paracompact. It is always possible to replace C by a topological category that has these properties (see Remark A.3.8), so this assumption\nis only a matter of convenience here.\nTheorem 2.3.5. If F : C \u2192 Cat(T op) is a continuous functor such that BF (f ) is\na homology equivalence for every f \u2208 MorC, then the sequence\nR\n/ BC\n/ B( F )\n(BF )(c)\nC\nis a homology fiber sequence.\nProof. This is a version of the \"generalised group completion theorem\" of [31,\nTheorem 3.2] (see also [12, Proposition 7.1]). A proof of a more general statement\nwill be given in Theorem A.3.7 of the appendix.\n\u0003\nThe next theorem is the main result that we will need in the following sections.\nTheorem 2.3.6. Suppose that C is HZ-stable along a subcategory J .

According to Theorem 2.3.5, there is a homology fiber sequence\nR\n/ B( GJ )\n/ BC.\n(BGJ )(c)\nC\nThe Grothendieck construction satisfies the following commutativity property\nR\nR\nR R\nR\nG = C J op F\u2212 (\u2212) = J op C F\u2212 (\u2212)\nC J\nand so by Lemma 2.2.1 and Corollary 2.1.2 there is a weak homotopy equivalence\nR\nR\nR\nB( J op C F\u2212 (\u2212)) \u2243 / B( J op EndC (\u2212)).\nHence there is a homology fiber sequence\nR\n/ B( op EndC (\u2212))\nBGJ (c)\nJ\nas required, and it is induced by the functors\nj \u2193C c \u2192 EndC (j) \u2192 C\n\n/ BC\n\n\fON THE HOMOTOPY TYPE OF CERTAIN COBORDISM CATEGORIES OF SURFACES\n\n9\n\nas can be seen from the proof of Lemma 2.2.1. The last statement is a consequence of the homotopical property of the Grothendieck construction as discussed\nin Proposition 2.1.1.\n\u0003\nExample 2.3.7. Consider the situation of Example 2.3.2. Let BEnd\u221e (c) =\nhocolimn BEndn (c). The monoid Endn (c) acts naturally on the space HomC (c\u2297n , 1).\nLet Fn denote the homotopy quotient of the action. There are canonical maps\nFn \u2192 Fn+1 , and so let F\u221e = hocolimn Fn . The last theorem gives sufficient conditions for the sequence F\u221e \u2192 BEnd\u221e (c) \u2192 BC to be a homology fiber sequence.\nRemark 2.3.8. The last theorem generalises in two ways (see Theorem A.3.11):\nfirst, the collection of inclusions EndC (j) \u2192 C can be replaced by a collection of\nfunctors Dj \u2192 C that are suitably connected together into a diagram of categories\nover C. Second, the class of homology equivalences can be replaced by any class of\nweak equivalences that satisfies certain local-to-global properties.\n2.4. The plus construction. We briefly recall some facts about Quillen's plus\nconstruction. For a detailed account of the construction and its properties, see for\nexample [3]. Throughout this subsection, we work with non-degenerately based\nconnected spaces X that have the homotopy type of a CW-complex.\nFor every perfect normal subgroup P of \u03c01 (X), there is a space XP and an\nacyclic cofibration qP : X \u2192 XP with ker\u03c01 (qP ) = P . The space XP is uniquely\ndetermined up to homotopy equivalence. The plus construction of X, denoted by\nX + , is the space associated with the maximal perfect subgroup of \u03c01 (X), denoted by\nP \u03c01 (X). The plus construction is a functorial assignment: given a map f : X \u2192 Y ,\nthere is a unique homotopy class of maps f + : X + \u2192 Y + that makes the following\nsquare\nX\n\nf\n\n/Y\n\n\u000f\n\u000f\nf+\n/ Y+\nX+\ncommute up to homotopy. If f : X \u2192 Y is an acyclic map and the maximal perfect\nsubgroup of \u03c01 (X) is trivial, then f is a homotopy equivalence. In particular, f +\nis a homotopy equivalence for every acyclic map f .\nProposition 2.4.1. If F \u2192 E \u2192 B is a homotopy fiber sequence of connected\nspaces and P \u03c01 (B) = 1, then F + \u2192 E + \u2192 B is also a homotopy fiber sequence.\nProof. See [3, Theorem 6.4].\n\n\u0003\n\nProposition 2.4.2. Let F \u2192 E \u2192 B be a homology fiber sequence of connected\nspaces. If\n(a) P \u03c01 (B) = 1 and\n(b) E + and F + are nilpotent spaces,\nthen F + \u2192 E + \u2192 B is a homotopy fiber sequence.\nProof. Let Ff denote the homotopy fiber of f and g : F \u2192 Ff be the induced homology equivalence. Note that Ff is connected. By Proposition 2.4.1, Ff+ \u2192 E + \u2192 B\nis a homotopy fiber sequence. Since E + is nilpotent by condition (b), the homotopy\nfiber Ff+ is again nilpotent (see [9]). Hence the map g + is a homology equivalence\nbetween nilpotent spaces, and therefore also a (weak) homotopy equivalence by the\n\n\f10\n\nGEORGE RAPTIS\n\ngeneralised Whitehead theorem [9]. It follows that F + \u2192 E + \u2192 B + = B is a\nhomotopy fiber sequence.\n\u0003\n3. The Cobordism Categories Ad\n3.1. Definition of Ad . Let d > 1 be an integer. The category Ad is a subcategory\nof the cobordism category of orientable surfaces up to homeomorphism. The objects\nare the non-negative integers regarded as disjoint unions of labelled circles up to\nhomeomorphism; a morphism from m to k is an orientable 2-dimensional cobordism\nup to homeomorphism with m incoming and k outgoing boundary circles and each\nof whose connected components is\n(a) either the cobordism of genus 0 from 1 to 1, i.e., the cylinder S 1 \u00d7 I,\n(b) or the surface of genus 0 with d boundary circles that are all incoming.\nThis morphism will be denoted by S(d) : d \u2192 0.\nThe disjoint union of cobordisms defines a symmetric monoidal pairing on Ad . In\nparticular, it makes the set of connected components \u03c00 BAd into an abelian monoid.\nAd has d connected components and the reduction map ObAd \u2192 Zd clearly induces\nan isomorphism\n\u223c Zd .\n\u03c00 BAd =\nBy well-known results in the theory of infinite loop spaces, it follows that BAd is\nan infinite loop space (e.g. see [25], [17]).\nNotation. We will write Ad for the component of the category Ad that contains\nthe object 0, and n for the object n * d of Ad .\n3.2. The homotopy fiber sequences. The monoid End(k) is canonically isomorphic with the group of permutations of k * d elements. For every k \u2208 ObAd , let\nik : End(k) \u2192 End(k + 1) be the homomorphism that corresponds to the canonical\ninclusion \u03a3kd \u2192 \u03a3(k+1)d . Also, let \u03b1k : k + 1 \u2192 k denote the morphism 1k \u2294 S(d)\nwhere S(d) is the unique morphism 1 \u2192 0 and \u2294 is the symmetric monoidal pairing\ngiven by the disjoint union of cobordisms. Let I denote the subcategory generated\nby the morphisms \u03b1k , k > 0. Note that I is precisely I(S(d)) in the notation of\nExample 2.3.2. For every \u03c3 \u2208 End(k), we have \u03c3\u03b1k = \u03b1k ik (\u03c3) , so Ad stabilises\nalong the subcategory I.\nThe little comma category n \u2193Ad k is a connected groupoid, and the automorphism group of each of its objects is isomorphic with the group \u03a3n\u2212k \u2240 \u03a3d . Thus\nthe inclusion \u03a3n\u2212k \u2240 \u03a3d \u2192 n \u2193Ad k of the automorphisms of the object n \u2192 k that\nis in I induces a homotopy equivalence between the classifying spaces. Moreover,\nthere is a commutative square\nB(n \u2193Ad k)\nO\n\u2243\n\nB(\u03a3n\u2212k \u2240 \u03a3d )\n\nB(\u03b1\u2217\nn)\n\n/ B(n + 1 \u2193A k)\nd\nO\n\u2243\n\n/ B(\u03a3n\u2212k+1 \u2240 \u03a3d )\n\nwhere the top map is induced by \u03b1n and in while the bottom map is induced by the\nnatural inclusion of groups. Thus the space hocolimI op B(\u2212 \u2193Ad k) can be identified\nup to homotopy with B(\u03a3\u221e \u2240 \u03a3d ) for every k \u2208 ObAd .\n\n\fON THE HOMOTOPY TYPE OF CERTAIN COBORDISM CATEGORIES OF SURFACES 11\n\nProposition 3.2.1. Ad is HZ-stable along I, i.e., for every morphism u : k \u2192 k\u2032\nthe canonical map\nhocolimI op B(\u2212 \u2193Ad k) \u2192 hocolimI op B(\u2212 \u2193Ad k\u2032 )\nis a homology equivalence.\nProof. It suffices to prove this for a morphism u : k + 1 \u2192 k. There is a commutative square\n/ B(n + 1 \u2193A k + 1)\nB(n \u2193A k + 1)\nd\n\nd\n\n\u000f\nB(n \u2193Ad k)\n\n\u000f\n/ B(n + 1 \u2193A k)\nd\n\nwhere the vertical maps are induced by u. This can be identified up to homotopy\nequivalence with a square\nB(\u03a3n\u2212(k+1) \u2240 \u03a3d )\n\n/ B(\u03a3n+1\u2212(k+1) \u2240 \u03a3d )\n\n\u000f\nB(\u03a3n\u2212k \u2240 \u03a3d )\n\n\u000f\n/ B(\u03a3n+1\u2212k \u2240 \u03a3d )\n\nwhere the horizontal maps are the canonical inclusions, but the vertical maps are\nconjugates of the canonical inclusions, i.e., they are given by the canonical inclusions of groups followed by an inner automorphism that re-labels the elements.\nNotice that an inner automorphism cannot be chosen uniformly for all n. But since\nconjugation by an element does not affect the map on homology, it follows that the\ninduced map between the colimits is a homology equivalence, and therefore so is\nthe map hocolimI op B(\u2212 \u2193Ad k + 1) \u2192 hocolimI op B(\u2212 \u2193Ad k).\n\u0003\nLet An \u2702 \u03a3n denote the alternating group. We will write An \u2240e \u03a3d for the\nsubgroup of \u03a3n \u2240 \u03a3d that consists of the elements (\u03c3; \u03b21 , ..., \u03b2n ) such that \u03c3 \u2208 An\nand the number of odd permutations among the \u03b2k 's is even.\nProposition 3.2.2.

(ii) The maximal\nperfect subgroup of \u03a3\u221e \u2240 \u03a3d is A\u221e \u2240e \u03a3d . The quotient is isomorphic with Z2 \u00d7 Z2 .\nProof. (i) The maximal perfect subgroup P of \u03a3n \u2240 \u03a3d is a subgroup of An \u2240e \u03a3d\nbecause every commutator in \u03a3n \u2240 \u03a3d lies in An \u2240e \u03a3d . Therefore it suffices to show\nthat An \u2240e \u03a3d is perfect. It is well-known that An is a perfect group for all n > 5.\nHence the commutator subgroup of An \u2240e \u03a3d contains the subgroup An \u2240 Ad . Then\nit suffices to note that every element of the form\n(id; (ab), (ab), id, * * * , id)\ncan be written as a commutator of the elements\n((12)(34); id, * * * , id),\n\n(id; (ab), id, * * * , (ab)).\n\nThe second claim is now obvious: there is a surjective homomorphism \u03c6 : \u03a3n \u2240\n\u03a3d \u2192 Z2 \u00d7 Z2 defined by \u03c6(\u03c3; \u03b21 , ..., \u03b2n ) = (sign(\u03c3), sign(\u03b21 * * * \u03b2n )) whose kernel\nis An \u2240e \u03a3d .

By Theorem 2.3.6 and Proposition 3.2.1, there is a homology fiber sequence\nB(\u03a3\u221e \u2240 \u03a3d ) \u2192 B\u03a3\u221e \u2192 BAd .\nThe conditions of Proposition 2.4.2 are satisfied and therefore\nB(\u03a3\u221e \u2240 \u03a3d )+ \u2192 B\u03a3+\n\u221e \u2192 BAd\nis a homotopy fiber sequence, as required. According to Theorem 2.3.6, the first\nmap is induced by the collection of forgetful functors n \u2193Ad 0 \u2192 End(n) that\ncan be identified (up to an equivalence of categories) with the homomorphisms\n\u03a3n \u2240 \u03a3d \u2192 \u03a3nd .\n\u0003\nBy Proposition 3.2.2, we can identify the homotopy fiber sequence at the level\nof the fundamental groups as follows:\n\u2022 if d is even, then \u03c01 (B(\u03a3\u221e \u2240 \u03a3d )+ ) \u223c\n= Z2 is the\n= Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2192 \u03c01 (B\u03a3\u221e + ) \u223c\nprojection onto a factor because an element (\u03c3; \u03b21 , * * * , \u03b2n ) in \u03a3\u221e \u2240 \u03a3d gives\nrise to an odd permutation in \u03a3\u221e if and only if {\u03b2k }16k6n contains an odd\nnumber of odd permutations,\n\u2022 if d is odd, it is given by the addition map in Z2 .\nBy the long exact sequence of homotopy groups, it follows that\n\u03c01 (BAd ) = {0}\nfor all d > 1.\nSince the spaces B(\u03a3\u221e \u2240 \u03a3d )+ and B\u03a3+\n\u221e can be identified up to weak homotopy\nequivalence with a connected component of the free infinite loop spaces QB\u03a3d+\nand QS 0 respectively, so the map\n[d] \u00d7 \u03c4 d : Z \u00d7 B(\u03a3\u221e \u2240 \u03a3d )+ \u2192 Z \u00d7 B\u03a3+\n\u221e\ncan be identified with the infinite loop map\n\u03c4d : Q(B\u03a3d )+ \u2192 QS 0\nthat is induced by the canonical map B\u03a3d \u2192 QS 0 .

(d = 1) Note that the category A1 is contractible because 0 is a\nterminal object.\n3.3. The stable transfer map. Let p : X \u2192 B be a covering map of CWcomplexes with finite fibers of size n. There is a construction of a stable map\ntrs : QB+ \u2192 QX+ , called the stable transfer map [1], [14], [21].\nWe recall the construction of the stable transfer map. Firstly, define the pretransfer map ptr : B \u2192 E\u03a3n \u00d7\u03a3n X n as follows: let X\u0304 \u2192 B be the \u03a3n -bundle\nassociated with the covering map p, i.e., X\u0304 = {(x1 , ..., xn ) \u2208 X n : {x1 , * * * , xn } =\np\u22121 (p(x1 ))}, and let f : B \u2192 B\u03a3n be the map that classifies this \u03a3n -bundle. There\nare \u03a3n -maps X\u0304 \u2192 X n and X\u0304 \u2192 E\u03a3n . Quotienting out the \u03a3n -action on both sides\nof the map X\u0304 \u2192 E\u03a3n \u00d7 X n , we obtain the pretranfer map ptr.\nFor any generalised cohomology theory h\u2217 , there is a transfer homomorphism\np! : h\u2217 (X+ ) \u2192 h\u2217 (B+ ) in the \"reverse\" direction. It is defined as follows: let \u03b1 \u2208\nhm (X+ ) be a cohomology class represented by a map \u1fb1 : X \u2192 Km , where {Km }\nis the \u03a9-spectrum that represents h\u2217 . Then p! (\u03b1) is defined to be the cohomology\nclass represented by\nptr\n\nn\n\u2192 Km\nB \u2192 E\u03a3n \u00d7\u03a3n X n \u2192 E\u03a3n \u00d7\u03a3n Km\n\nwhere the last map is defined by the n-fold loop structure of Km \u223c\n= \u03a9n Km+n .\n\u2217\nLet h be the cohomology theory represented by the infinite loop space QX+ .\nThe transfer map is defined to be\ntr := p! (iX )\nwhere iX : X \u2192 QX+ denotes the canonical inclusion.\nThe stable transfer map trs : QB+ \u2192 QX+ is the unique map of infinite loop\nspaces that is induced by the transfer map. In detail, it is defined by the collection\nof maps\nE\u03a3m \u00d7\u03a3m B m\n\n1\u00d7(ptr)m\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nE\u03a3m \u00d7\u03a3m (E\u03a3n \u00d7\u03a3n X n )m \u2192 E\u03a3mn \u00d7\u03a3mn X mn\n\nfor all m > 0. The last map comes from the operadic action of {E\u03a3n }n on QX+\nor, in other words, the infinite loop space structure of QX+ . In order to interpret\nthese maps geometrically, it is useful to think of the space of ordered configurations\nof n points in R\u221e as a concrete model for E\u03a3n .\nProposition 3.3.1. The map \u03c4d+1 : Q(B\u03a3d+1 )+ \u2192 QS 0 is the composition of\nthe stable transfer map Q(B\u03a3d+1 )+ \u2192 Q(B\u03a3d )+ of the covering up to homotopy\nB\u03a3d \u2192 B\u03a3d+1 followed by the projection map Q(B\u03a3d )+ \u2192 QS 0 that is induced by\nB\u03a3d \u2192 pt. In particular, \u03c42 : Q(B\u03a32 )+ \u2192 QS 0 is the stable transfer map of the\nuniversal double covering.\nProof. The composition of the two stable maps is induced by the composition of\nthe pretransfer map B\u03a3d+1 \u2192 E\u03a3d+1 \u00d7\u03a3d+1 (B\u03a3d )d+1 followed by the projection\nE\u03a3d+1 \u00d7\u03a3d+1 (B\u03a3d )d+1 \u2192 E\u03a3d+1 \u00d7\u03a3d+1 \u2217 = B\u03a3d+1 \u2192 QS 0 . This is also the map\nthat induces \u03c4d+1 , hence result.\n\u0003\nA geometric interpretation of the map \u03c4d : Q(B\u03a3d )+ \u2192 QS 0 can be given\nin terms of framed bordism. The framed bordism groups \u03a9f\u2217 r (X) of a (unbased)\n\n\f14\n\nGEORGE RAPTIS\n\nspace X define a (unreduced) generalised homology theory that is represented by the\nsphere spectrum, i.e. \u03a9fnr (X) \u223c\n= \u03c0n (QX+ ). The elements of \u03a9fnr (X) are represented\nby triples (M, \u03c6; f ) where M is a closed smooth n-dimensional manifold, \u03c6 is a\ntrivialisation of its stable normal bundle (i.e., a lifting of the stable normal bundle\n\u03bd\u0304 : M \u2192 BO(N ) to EO(N )) and a map f : M \u2192 X, up to framed bordisms in X.\nThe homomorphism \u03c0n (\u03c4d ) : \u03c0n Q(B\u03a3d )+ \u2192 \u03c0n QS 0 takes a class (M, \u03c6; f ) to the\nclass (M \u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 ) where M \u2032 \u2192 M is the d-fold covering pulled back from B\u03a3d\u22121 \u2192 B\u03a3d\nalong the map f , and \u03c6\u2032 is the trivialisation of the stable normal bundle of M \u2032 that\nis induced by \u03c6.\nCorollary 3.3.2. There are short exact sequences of abelian groups\n\u03c0n (\u03c4d )\n\n0 \u2192 \u03c0n+1 BAd \u2192 \u03a9fnr (B\u03a3d ) \u2212\u2192 \u03a9fnr (pt) \u2192 0\nfor every n > 1.\nProof. By the Kahn-Priddy theorem (see [14], [26]), the homomorphism \u03a9fnr (B\u03a3d ) \u2192\n\u03a9fnr (pt) is surjective for all n > 1. (Note that it suffices to know this for d = 2.\nFor n = 0, the map is given by multiplication by d.). Then the result follows from\nthe long exact sequence of homotopy groups associated with the homotopy fiber\nsequence of Theorem 3.2.4.\n\u0003\nCorollary 3.3.3. \u03c02 (BAd ) \u223c\n= Z2 for every d > 2.\nProof. This follows easily from the description of \u03c01 (\u03c4d ) and Corollary 3.3.2.\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 3.3.4. (d \u2192 \u221e) The canonical inclusion B\u03a3d \u2192 B\u03a3d+1 induces an\ninfinite loop map jd : Q(B\u03a3d )+ \u2192 Q(B\u03a3d+1 )+ , and it is immediate that the maps\n\u03c4 d and \u03c4 d+1 jd agree. Moreover, there is a symmetric monoidal functor Ad \u2192 Ad+1\nthat is defined on objects by n 7\u2192 n. Together they give a map of homotopy fiber\nsequences\nQ0 (B\u03a3d )+\n\n\u03c4d\n\n\u000f\n\u03c4 d+1\nQ0 B(\u03a3d+1 )+\n\n/ Q0 S 0\n\n/ BA\nd\n\n\u000f\n/ Q0 S 0\n\n\u000f\n/ BAd+1 .\n\nBy letting d \u2192 \u221e, we obtain a homotopy fiber sequence Q0 Q0 S 0 \u2192 Q0 S 0 \u2192 BA\u221e\nwhere the first map is the canonical map induced by the identity 1 : Q0 S 0 \u2192 Q0 S 0 .\nRemark 3.3.5. (representations of Ad ) Let (E, \u2297, 1) be a strict symmetric monoidal\ncategory. A symmetric monoidal functor F : Ad \u2192 E is uniquely determined by\na choice of an object E \u2208 ObE and a morphism \u03bb : E \u2297d \u2192 1 which is invariant\nunder the action of the symmetric group on E \u2297d . Furthermore, the category of\nsymmetric monoidal representations of Ad in E is equivalent to a category of such\npairs.\n+\n4. The Cobordism Categories C1,\u2202 and C1,\u2202\n\n4.1. The cobordism categories Cd and Cd,\u2202 . Let Cd denote the embedded ddimensional cobordism category of [12]. Broadly speaking, the space of objects\nis the space of closed smooth (d \u2212 1)-dimensional submanifolds of high Euclidean\nspace and the space of morphisms is the space of smooth d-dimensional embedded\n\n\fON THE HOMOTOPY TYPE OF CERTAIN COBORDISM CATEGORIES OF SURFACES 15\n\ncobordisms with collared boundary. For the precise definition of this category and\nits variations, see [12].\nThe disjoint union of cobordisms makes Cd into a symmetric monoidal category.\nNote that \u03c00 BCd is exactly the unoriented bordism group of (d \u2212 1)-dimensional\nmanifolds. By well-known results in infinite loop space theory (see [25], [17]), it\nfollows that the classifying space BCd is an infinite loop space. The main result of\n[12] identifies this infinite loop space with the infinite loop space associated to a\nThom spectrum.\nLet Grd (Rd+n ) denote the Grassmannian manifold of d-dimensional linear subspaces in Rd+n .

We may regard A2 as a cobordism category of 1-dimensional\ncobordisms by thinking of its objects as collections of points and its morphisms\nas 1-dimensional cobordisms each of whose components has non-empty incoming\nboundary.

The Cobordism Categories Ag,d\n5.1. Definition of Ag,d . Fix integers d > 1 and g > 0. Following the construction\nof [30], the cobordism category Ag,d is a model for a subcategory Mg,d of the\ncobordism category of Riemann surfaces M [27]. It has the same objects as M and\na morphism from m to k is a Riemann surface with m incoming and k outgoing\nparametrised boundary circles such that each of its connected components is\n(A) either a complex annulus with one incoming and one outgoing boundary\ncomponent that represents a morphism 1 \u2192 1,\n(B) or a Riemann surface of genus g with d incoming parametrised boundary\ncomponents that represents a morphism d \u2192 0.\nComposition of morphisms is defined by gluing Riemann surfaces along their boundary components using the parametrisations. The space of objects is discrete and\nthe topology on the morphism sets is induced from the associated moduli spaces of\nRiemann surfaces.\nLet \u00c3g,d be the 2-category that enriches Ad with 2-morphisms given by isotopy\nclasses of orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms of surfaces with type (A) or (B).\nIn detail, the objects of \u00c3g,d are the same as in Ad , i.e. the non-negative integers,\nthe 1-morphisms are given by orientable smooth 2-dimensional cobordisms each of\nwhose components is diffeomorphic to (A) or (B) as above, and the 2-morphisms are\ngiven by isotopy classes of orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms of surfaces that\nfix the boundary pointwise. The disjoint union of cobordisms (and diffeomorphisms)\ndefines a symmetric monoidal pairing on the 2-category \u00c3g,d . (For a more detailed\ndiscussion of the construction of such a 2-category, see [30].).\nWe recall some standard notation for the mapping class groups. Let \u03a3qg,p denote an orientable surface of genus g with p boundary components and q marked\npoints. Let Diff + (\u03a3qg,p , \u2202, \u2217) be the topological group of orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms that fix the boundary and the marked points pointwise. The mapping class group is the group of connected components \u0393qg,p = \u03c00 (Diff + (\u03a3qg,p , \u2202, \u2217)).\n\n\fON THE HOMOTOPY TYPE OF CERTAIN COBORDISM CATEGORIES OF SURFACES 19\n\nBy the fundamental results of Earle-Eells[10] and Earle-Schatz [11], the projection Diff + (\u03a3qg,p , \u2202, \u2217) \u2192 \u0393qg,p is a homotopy equivalence if 3g + 2q + 5p > 5.\n(q)\n\nLet \u0393g,(p) denote the group of connected components of the topological group\nDiff + (\u03a3qg,p , {\u2202}, {\u2217}) of orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms that are allowed to\npermute the boundary components and the marked points. There is a short exact\nsequence of groups\n(q)\n1 \u2192 \u0393qg,p \u2192 \u0393g,(p) \u2192 \u03a3q \u00d7 \u03a3p \u2192 1.\nThe cobordism category Ag,d is the topological category that is obtained from\n\u00c3g,d by applying the classifying space functor on the morphism categories. Note\nthat the category of the connected components of Ag,d is precisely the category Ad .\nDisjoint union of surfaces defines a symmetric monoidal structure on Ag,d . Since\n\u03c00 (BAg,d ) \u223c\n= Zd is a group, it follows that BAg,d is an infinite loop space, see [25],\n[17].\nNotation. We will write Ag,d to denote the connected component of Ag,d that\ncontains the object 0 and n for the object n * d.\nThe special case of the topological category M0,2 and its category of components\nA2 was studied by Costello in (an earlier version of)[7], [8]1 in connection with the\nhomotopy type of the moduli spaces of stable Riemann surfaces. The topology\non M0,2 is determined by the moduli space of parametrised complex annuli. This\nspace is homeomorphic to (0, 1) \u00d7 (Diff + (S 1 ) \u00d7 Diff + (S 1 ))/S 1 \u2243 S 1 , where (0, 1)\ncomes from the ratio of the radii of the annulus and Diff + (S 1 ) \u00d7 Diff + (S 1 )/S 1\ncomes from the choice of parametrisations up to rotational symmetry. M0,2 acts\non the moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces by adding annuli either (A) to extend\na boundary component, or (B) to join pairs of boundary components. This action\ndefines a functor M : M0,2 \u2192 T op that takes the object n to the moduli space\nof possibly disconnected Riemann surfaces with n parametrised outgoing boundary\ncomponents subject to the stability condition that no component can be a sphere\nwith 6 2 boundaries or a torus with no boundaries. On morphisms, the functor is\ndefined by gluing Riemann surfaces.\nOn the other hand, the category A2 acts on the moduli spaces of stable Riemann\nsurfaces as follows. There is a functor M : A2 \u2192 T op that takes the object n to\nthe moduli space of stable, possibly disconnected, Riemann surfaces with n marked\nsmooth points. On morphisms, M is defined by gluing together pairs of marked\npoints. The operation of gluing pairs of marked points adds new nodes to the\nstable Riemann surface. Costello asks how to \"approximate\" the functor of the\ncompactified moduli spaces M by the functor M along the projection \u03c00 : M0,2 \u2192\nA2 . There is a pull-back functor \u03c00\u2217 : Fun(A2 , T op) \u2192 Fun(M0,2 , T op) which\nhas a homotopy left adjoint L\u03c00\u2217 . Costello showed that the left homotopy Kan\nextension of M along \u03c00 is homotopy equivalent to M as functors. Recall that the\n(rational) homotopy type of the moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces is given by\nthe homotopy of the corresponding mapping class groups and that the mapping\nclass groups are generated by Dehn twists at embedded annuli. A left (homotopy)\nKan extension is a best approximation from the left, so its definition involves a\n(homotopy) colimit operation. Then, roughly speaking, Costello's claim can be\nbased on the observation that the homotopical effect of the action of the complex\n1Costello denotes M\n0,2 by A and A2 by B.\n\n\f20\n\nGEORGE RAPTIS\n\nannuli of M0,2 on a boundary component of a Riemann surface is the same as\nthat of closing the boundary by adding a disc and thus creating a smooth marked\npoint, while the homotopical effect of the action of the complex annuli on a pair of\nboundary components is that of killing the contribution of the Dehn twist at the\nannulus, which is the same as collapsing the embedded circle in the middle of the\nannulus and thus creating a node. This result is stated in an earlier version of [7]\nthat appeared on the arXiv, but it seems that a proof of it as stated is not available\nin print at the moment. A different version of this result by Costello can be found\nin [8].\n5.2. The homotopy fiber sequences. The 2-categorical structure of \u00c3g,d is determined by the groupoids \u00c3g,d (1, 1) and \u00c3g,d (d, 0). The groupoid \u00c3g,d (1, 1) is\nequivalent with the mapping class group \u03930,1+1 \u223c\n= Z as a category with one object.\n\u00c3g,d (d, 0) is a connected groupoid which is equivalent with the mapping class group\n\u0393g,d . The set of objects of \u00c3g,d (d, 0) is identified with the set of permutations \u03a3d ,\ni.e., every object corresponds to a different labelling of the circles of some fixed reference surface \u03a3g,d . In order to determine the homotopy type of the little comma\ncategories of Ag,d , we first need to look at the functor\n\u03c6 : \u00c3g,d (d, d) \u00d7 \u00c3g,d (d, 0) \u2192 \u00c3g,d (d, 0)\nthat gives the composition in \u00c3g,d .\nThe objects of \u00c3g,d (d, d) correspond to the different labellings of the boundary\ncircles of the d cylinders, so they are also identified with the set of permutations\n\u03a3d . The group of automorphisms of any object is isomorphic with the group Zd .\nThe composition functor \u00c3g,d (d, d) \u00d7 \u00c3g,d (d, d) \u2192 \u00c3g,d (d, d) makes \u00c3g,d (d, d) into\na monoidal category. On objects, the monoidal pairing is given by the group multiplication of \u03a3d and on the morphisms by the group multiplication of \u03a3d \u2240 Z. The\nrestriction of the composition map \u03c6 at an object defines an action Zd \u00d7\u0393g,d \u2192 \u0393g,d .\nThe classifying space B \u00c3g,d (d, d) is the topological group \u03a3d \u2240 BZ \u2243 \u03a3d \u2240 SO(2).\nLemma 5.2.1.

(a) is clear. (b) Gluing discs along the boudary components of \u03a3g,d and\nextending diffeomorphisms by the identity defines a map\nDiff + (\u03a3g,d , \u2202) \u2192 Diff + (\u03a3dg , \u2217).\nThe evaluation of the differential of a diffeomorphism f \u2208 Diff + (\u03a3dg , \u2217) at the\nd marked points gives a map Diff + (\u03a3dg , \u2217) \u2192 SO(2)d , and there is a homotopy\nfibration\nDiff + (\u03a3g,d , \u2202) \u2192 Diff + (\u03a3dg , \u2217) \u2192 SO(2)d .\nThe required short exact sequence comes from the long exact sequence of homotopy\ngroups since Diff + (\u03a3dg , \u2217) and Diff + (\u03a3g,d , \u2202) have contractible components when\n\n\fON THE HOMOTOPY TYPE OF CERTAIN COBORDISM CATEGORIES OF SURFACES 21\n\ng > 0 and d > 1 or d > 2 [10], [11]. The homomorphism Zd \u2192 \u0393g,d is the fiber\ntransport of the homotopy fibration and it maps into the Dehn twists near the\nboundary components. The short exact sequence is central because Dehn twists\naround simple closed curves \u03b1, \u03b2 commute if the intersection number i(\u03b1, \u03b2) is zero,\nso the Dehn twists at the boundary components are central relative to a generating\nset of Dehn twists for the mapping class group \u0393g,d . (c) follows from the well-known\n\u2243\nhomotopy equivalence SO(3) \u0592\u2192 Diff + (S 2 ), see [28].\n\u0003\nRemark 5.2.2. (genus 0) The mapping class group \u03930,d is isomorphic with the pure\nribbon braid group P R\u03b2d\u22121 . There is an isomorphism P R\u03b2d\u22121 \u223c\n= P \u03b2d\u22121 \u00d7 Zd\u22121 ,\nd\u22121\nwhere P \u03b2d\u22121 denotes the pure braid group. The factor Z\ncorresponds to the\nDehn twists around d \u2212 1 circles. The center of the pure braid group P \u03b2d\u22121 is\nisomorphic with Z generated by the braid that corresponds to the Dehn twist\naround a closed curve homotopic to the boundary of the punctured disc (see [4]).\nLemma 5.2.3. (a) Let g > 0 or d > 2. There is a homotopy equivalence\nB(k \u2193Ag,d k\u2032 ) \u2243 B(\u03a3k\u2212k\u2032 \u2240 \u0393(d)\ng ).\n(b) There is a homotopy equivalence B(k \u2193A0,2 k\u2032 ) \u2243 B(\u03a3k\u2212k\u2032 \u2240 O(2)).\n(c) There is a homotopy equivalence B(k \u2193A0,1 k\u2032 ) \u2243 B(\u03a3k\u2212k\u2032 \u2240 SO(2)).\nProof. (a) As was pointed out in section 2.2, the space B(k \u2193Ag,d k\u2032 ) is homotopy equivalent with the homotopy quotient of Ag,d (k, k\u2032 ) by the right action of\nAg,d (k, k) \u223c\n= \u03a3kd \u2240 BZ. The action of (BZ)kd restricts to an action on each compo\u2032\nnent of Ag,d (k, k\u2032 ), and by Lemma 5.2.1(b), its homotopy quotient is (B\u0393dg )k\u2212k .\nThe components of Ag,d (k, k\u2032 ) correspond to the cosets of \u03a3k\u2212k\u2032 \u2240\u03a3d in \u03a3kd , and the\naction of \u03a3kd on the components is the canonical transitive action. Therefore the\n\u2032\nrequired homotopy quotient is equivalent with the homotopy quotient of (B\u0393dg )k\u2212k\nby \u03a3k\u2212k\u2032 \u2240 \u03a3d , where the action of \u03a3d on each copy of B\u0393dg is induced by the covering action of \u03a3d on Ag,d (1, 0). By Lemma 5.2.1(a), the homotopy quotient of\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n(d)\n(d)\n(B\u0393dg )k\u2212k by \u03a3dk\u2212k is (B\u0393g )k\u2212k . Finally, the homotopy quotient of (B\u0393g )k\u2212k\n(d)\n\n\u2032\n\nby \u03a3k\u2212k\u2032 is E\u03a3k\u2212k\u2032 \u00d7\u03a3k\u2212k\u2032 (B\u0393g )k\u2212k , and hence the required result.\n(b) Although the case (g, d) = (0, 2) is somewhat special (see Remark 5.2.4\nbelow), the arguments here are analogous. In this case, the action of A0,2 (k, k) on\nA0,2 (k, k\u2032 ) is transitive, so the homotopy quotient is equivalent with the classifying\nspace of the stabiliser group of any element. Let \u03b1 : k \u2192 k\u2032 be an object in\nk \u2193A0,2 k\u2032 . The automorphism group of this object is exactly the stabiliser subgroup\nof the element \u03b1 with respect to the action of A0,2 (k, k). Firstly, we determine this\nstabiliser subgroup at the 2-categorical level when \u03b1 is a single annulus 1 \u2192 0. The\naction of the component of the identity of A0,2 (1, 1) on A0,2 (1, 0) can be written\nat the level of the mapping class groups as follows:\n(Z \u00d7 Z) \u00d7 Z \u2192 Z\n(t1 , t2 ), m 7\u2192 t1 + m + t2 .\nThe stabiliser subgroup of this (restricted) action at m = 0 is the subgroup {(n, \u2212n) \u2208\nZ \u00d7 Z : n \u2208 Z} \u2702 Z \u00d7 Z, so it is isomorphic with Z. The group \u03a32 of components of\nA0,2 (1, 1) permutes the (integral) coordinates, so the stabiliser of the full action is\nisomorphic with \u03a32 \u22c9 BZ as a subgroup of EndA0,2 (1, 1), and where the semi-direct\n\n\f22\n\nGEORGE RAPTIS\n\nproduct is defined with respect to the action induced by n 7\u2192 \u2212n. Similarly, the\nstabiliser subgroups of the action of EndA0,2 (k, k) on A0,2 (k, k\u2032 ) can be identified\nwith \u03a3k\u2212k\u2032 \u2240 (\u03a32 \u22c9 BZ). There is a homotopy equivalence BZ \u2243 SO(2) such that\nthe action n 7\u2192 \u2212n corresponds to the conjugation by the reflection at the x\u2212axis.\nFinally, note that O(2) = \u03a32 \u22c9 SO(2) as the only non-trivial extension of SO(2)\nby \u03a32 . (c) is similar.\n\u0003\nRemark 5.2.4. ((g, d) = (0, 2)) The cases d = 1, 2 and d > 2 differ because the\ncomponents of Diff + (\u03a3d0 , \u2217) are not contractible unless d > 2.\nLet ik : End(k) \u2192 End(k + 1) be the homomorphism that corresponds to the\ncanonical inclusions \u03a3kd \u2240 BZ \u2192 \u03a3(k+1)d \u2240 BZ for all k \u2208 ObAg,d . Let S(g, d) be a\nbasepoint of Ag,d (1, 0), and let \u03b2k : k + 1 \u2192 k denote the morphism 1k \u2294 S(g, d)\nin Ag,d . Let I be the subcategory generated by the morphisms \u03b2k , k > 0. Since\n\u03c3\u03b2k = \u03b2k ik (\u03c3) for every \u03c3 \u2208 End(k), it follows that Ag,d stabilizes along I, cf.\nExample 2.3.2.\nProposition 5.2.5. Ag,d is HZ-stable along I for all d > 1 and g > 0.\nProof. The proof is similar to Proposition 3.2.1. It suffices to show that for every\nmorphism u : k + 1 \u2192 k, the canonical map\nu\n\n\u2217\nB(n \u2193Ag,d k + 1) \u2212\u2192\nB(n \u2193Ag,d k)\n\n(5.1)\n\ninduces a homology equivalence between the colimits over I as n \u2192 \u221e. If (g, d) 6=\n(0, 1), (0, 2), then by Lemma 5.2.3(a), this map can be identified up to homotopy\nwith an inclusion\n(5.2)\n\nn\u2212(k+1)\nn\u2212k\n\u2192 E\u03a3n\u2212k \u00d7\u03a3n\u2212k (B\u0393(d)\nE\u03a3n\u2212(k+1) \u00d7\u03a3n\u2212(k+1) (B\u0393(d)\ng )\ng )\n(d)\n\nthat is determined by a choice of a base-point \u2217 \u2192 B\u0393g,d \u2192 B\u0393g . This choice\n(d)\nof basepoint depends on the morphism u : k + 1 \u2192 k. However, since B\u0393g\nis path-connected, the homotopy class of the map is independent of this choice.\nThe identification of (5.1) with (5.2) is natural in n only up to a \"re-labelling\",\ni.e., conjugation by an element of \u03a3n\u2212k . But this conjugation does not change\nthe induced homomorphism on homology. Hence the induced map on homology\nbetween the colimit of (5.1) is the same as that of (5.2), so it is a homology\nequivalence. The cases (g, d) = (0, 1), (0, 2) are similar.\n\u0003\nCombining the last proposition with the methods of Section 2.3, we can now\nprove the main result of this section.\nTheorem 5.2.6.

((g, d) = (0, 1)) The same argument shows that there is also a\n1\nhomotopy fiber sequence QBSO(2)+ \u2192 QBSO(2)+ \u2192 BA0,1 . Indeed the category\nA0,1 has a terminal object 0, so the classifying space BA0,1 is contractible.\nDue to the contractibility of the components of the relevant diffeomorphism\ngroups, Theorem 5.2.6 can be stated more uniformly as saying that there is a\nhomotopy fiber sequence\nQBDiff + (\u03a3(d)\ng )+ \u2192 QBSO(2)+ \u2192 BAg,d\nfor all g > 0 and d > 1. In fact, the theorem is more accurately viewed as a\nstatement about diffeomorphism groups. (This fact can be traced already in the\nproof of Lemma 5.2.1.). The introduction of the mapping class group is merely a\ntechncal point here that facilitates a concrete construction of the categories Ag,d .\nFurthermore the projection functor \u03c00 : Ag,d \u2192 Ad induces a map of homotopy\nfiber sequences,\n(d)\n\nQBDiff + (\u03a3g )+\n\n/ QBSO(2)+\n\n/ BAg,d\n\n\u000f\nQB\u03a3d+\n\n\u000f\n/ QS 0\n\n\u000f\n/ BAd\n(d)\n\nwhere the vertical maps are induced by the maps Diff + (\u03a3g ) \u2192 \u03a3d (cf. Lemma\n5.2.1) and SO(2) \u2192 \u2217 respectively.\nRemark 5.2.8. (the map BAg,d \u2192 BS) There is an inclusion functor Ag,d \u2192\nS where S denotes Tillmann's model for the surface category [31], [30] with the\nopposite convention for the positive boundary condition. Tillmann [31] proved that\n\u2243\nthere is a weak homotopy equivalence Z \u00d7 B\u0393+\n\u221e \u2192 \u03a9BS where \u0393\u221e := colimg \u0393g,1 is\nthe stable mapping class group that is obtained by gluing a torus with two boundary\ncomponents and extending diffeomorphisms by the identity. Then it is easy to see\nthat the induced map\nB\u0393g,d \u2243 Ag,d (d, 0) \u2192 \u03a9BAg,d \u2192 \u03a9BS \u2243 Z \u00d7 B\u0393+\n\u221e\n\n\f24\n\nGEORGE RAPTIS\n\nis up to homotopy given by the canonical map B\u0393g,d \u2192 {g} \u00d7 B\u0393+\n\u221e,(d\u22121)+1 \u2243\n+\nB\u0393\u221e . By Harer's stability theorem, the last map induces isomorphisms in integral\nhomology in degrees \u2217 < \u01eb(g) that increases to \u221e as g \u2192 \u221e.\nThere is an interesting variant of the categories Ag,d that allows stabilisation\nwith respect to the genus. For simplicity, let us assume that d = 1. The cobordism\ncategory Ag,1+1 is defined similarly with Ag,1 , but we make the following additional\nspecifications:\n\u2022 the surface \u03a3g,d is equipped with an embedded disc D2 \u2286 \u03a3g,d that does\nnot meet the boundary, and\n\u2022 the orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms are required to fix the disc pointwise.\nThen the space Ag,1+1 (1, 0) is equivalent to B\u0393g,1+1 . The same arguments that\nled up to Theorem 5.2.6 apply also similarly to show that there is a homotopy fiber\nsequence\nQ(B\u03931g,1 )+ \u2192 QBSO(2)+ \u2192 BAg,1+1\nfor all g > 0. The operation of cutting out the embedded disc and adding a torus\nwith two boundary components defines a symmetric monoidal functor Ag,1+1 \u2192\nAg+1,1+1 . This induces a map of homotopy fiber sequences,\nQ(B\u03931g,1 )+\n\n/ QBSO(2)+\n\n/ BAg,1+1\n\n\u000f\nQ(B\u03931g+1,1 )+\n\n\u000f\n/ QBSO(2)+\n\n\u000f\n/ BAg+1,1+1\n\nwhere the vertical map on the left is induced by the standard stabilisation map\n\u03931g,1 \u2192 \u03931g+1,1 . Taking the colimit as g \u2192 \u221e, we obtain a homotopy fiber sequence\n(5.5)\n\nQ(B\u03931\u221e,1 )+ \u2192 QBSO(2)+ \u2192 BA\u221e,1\n\nwhere the first map is induced by the evaluation of the differential of a diffeomorphism at the marked point. By [5, Theorem 1.1], this map splits after plus\nconstruction, i.e. there is a homotopy equivalence\n(B\u03931\u221e,1 )+ \u2243 B\u0393+\n\u221e,1 \u00d7 BSO(2),\nso the homotopy fiber sequence (5.5) splits also.\n5.3.

Lemma 5.2.1. In the special case (g, d) = (0, 2),\nwe can identify this as a stable transfer map.\nProposition 5.3.1. The map QBO(2)+ \u2192 QBSO(2)+ in (5.3) is the stable transfer map of the double covering (associated with) BSO(2) \u2192 BO(2).\n\n\fON THE HOMOTOPY TYPE OF CERTAIN COBORDISM CATEGORIES OF SURFACES 25\n\nProof. The map is induced by the forgetful functor 1 \u2193A0,2 0 \u2192 EndA0,2 (1) which\ncan be identified with the homomorphism\n\u03a32 \u22c9 SO(2) \u2192 \u03a32 \u2240 SO(2)\n(\u03c3, \u03b8) 7\u2192 (\u03c3; \u03b8, \u2212\u03b8).\nHere \u03b8 is the angle of a rotation in SO(2). This homomorphism induces the pretransfer BO(2) = B(\u03a32 \u22c9 SO(2)) \u2192 E\u03a32 \u00d7\u03a32 BSO(2)2 of the double covering\nBSO(2) \u2192 BO(2), hence the result follows.\n\u0003\nLet \u03b42 : or2 \u2192 BO(2) denote the determinant line bundle, i.e. the line bundle\nassociated with the double covering pn : Gr2+ (R2+\u221e ) \u2192 Gr2 (R2+\u221e ). Let \u2212\u03b42 :\nBO(2) \u2192 Z \u00d7 BO be the (classifying map of) the stable vector bundle of rank \u22121\nthat is inverse to \u03b42 . This produces a Thom spectrum Th(\u2212\u03b42 ) in the following\nway (see also [22, IV.5]). Let {\u22121} \u00d7 BO(n \u2212 1) \u0592\u2192 Z \u00d7 BO denote the canonical\ninclusion and Xn := (\u2212\u03b42 )\u22121 ({\u22121} \u00d7 BO(n \u2212 1)).

Let \u03b42,n := \u03b42 |Xn and pn : S(\u03b42,n ) \u2192 Xn denote the projection from the\n\u22a5\nassociated double covering. The bundles \u03b42,n and \u03b42,n\ngive a cofiber sequence (see\n[13, Lemma 2.1]),\n(5.6)\n\n\u2202\n\u22a5\n\u22a5\n\u22a5\n).\nT h(\u03b42,n\n) \u2192 T h(\u03b42,n \u2295 \u03b42,n\n)\u223c\n= \u03a3n Xn+ \u2192 T h(R \u2295 p\u2217n \u03b42,n\n\nwhere the map \u2202 is a parametrised Pontryagin-Thom map for the double covering\n\u22a5\npn . The bundle R \u2295 p\u2217n \u03b42,n\nis trivial, so the cofiber sequence (5.6) can be written as\n\u2202\n\nTh(\u2212\u03b42 )n \u2192 \u03a3n Xn+ \u2192 \u03a3n S(\u03b42,n )+\nwhere the last map induces the stable transfer map of the double covering pn .\nSince Gr2 (R2+n ) is contained in XN for some N sufficiently large, it follows that\nthe connectivity of the inclusions Xn \u2192 BO(2) and S(\u03b42,n ) \u2192 BSO(2) increases\nto \u221e as n \u2192 \u221e.

Comma categories. The purpose of this appendix is to discuss some generalisations of the results of Section 2. Let C be a small topological category with\na discrete space of objects such that the inclusion ObC \u2192 MorC is a cofibration.\nLet D be a small topological category and F : D \u2192 C a continuous functor. For\nevery c \u2208 ObC, there is an over-category F \u2193 c. The objects are the morphisms\nu\nv\nF (d) \u2192 c in C and a morphism from F (d) \u2192 c to F (d\u2032 ) \u2192 c is given by a morphism\nf\n\nd \u2192 d\u2032 such that the triangle\nF (f )\n\n/ F (d\u2032 )\nv\nv\nvv\nu\nvv v\nv\n\u000f zvv\nc\n\nF (d)\n\ncommutes in C. Composition of morphisms in F \u2193 c is defined by the composition\nin D. This defines a topological category where the topology is induced by the\ntopologies of C and D. Furthermore, the definition of F \u2193 c is natural in c, i.e., for\nevery pair (D, F : D \u2192 C), there is a continuous functor\nF (D, F ) : C \u2192 Cat(T op)\nc 7\u2192 F (D, F )(c) := F \u2193 c\nf\n\nf\u2217\n\n(c \u2192 c\u2032 ) 7\u2192 (F \u2193 c \u2192 F \u2193 c\u2032 )).\nLet us consider a category T (C) of such pairs. The objects of T (C) are pairs\n(D, F : D \u2192 C) where D is a small topological category and F is a continuous\nfunctor. A morphism from (D, F ) to (E, G) is a pair (\u03ba, \u03b7) where \u03ba : D \u2192 E is a\ncontinuous functor and \u03b7 : G \u25e6 \u03ba \u2192 F is a natural transformation. Note that the\ndefinition of T (C) is natural in C.\nF\n\nExample A.1.1. If D = EndC (c) \u2192 C is the natural inclusion, then F (D, F ) is\nthe diagram of little comma categories Fc of section 2.2.\nLet Fun(C, Cat(T op)) denote the category of continuous functors C \u2192 Cat(T op)\nand natural transformations between them. The following proposition may be\nconsidered as a generalisation of the Yoneda lemma.\nProposition A.1.2. There is a fully faithful functor F : T (C) \u2192 Fun(C, Cat(T op)).\nProof. Let us clarify the definition of F on morphisms: a morphism (\u03ba, \u03b7) : (D, F ) \u2192\n(E, G) in T (C) goes to the natural transformation F(\u03ba,\u03b7) : F (D, F ) \u2192 F (E, G) whose\n\n\fON THE HOMOTOPY TYPE OF CERTAIN COBORDISM CATEGORIES OF SURFACES 27\n\ncomponent functor at the object c \u2208 ObC is induced by the diagram\nG\u03ba(d)\n\nG\u03ba(\u03c3)\n\n/ G\u03ba(d\u2032 )\n\u03b7d\u2032\n\n\u03b7d\n\n\u000f\nF (\u03c3)\n/ F (d\u2032 )\nt\ntt\ntt\nt\nt\n\u000f ty tt\nc\n\n\u000f\nF (d)\n\nIt is clear that F is faithful. In order to see that it is also full, let \u03b4 : F (D, F ) \u2192\nF (E, G) be a natural transformation between diagrams of comma categories that\nare induced by F : D \u2192 C and G : E \u2192 C respectively. For every u : c \u2192 c\u2032 in C,\nthere is a commutative diagram\nF \u2193c\n\n\u03b4c\n\n/G\u2193c\n\nu\u2217\n\n\u000f\nF \u2193 c\u2032\n\nu\u2217\n\u03b4c\u2032\n\n\u000f\n/ G \u2193 c\u2032\n\nLet pc : G \u2193 c \u2192 E denote the obvious forgetful functor. We define a functor\n\u03ba : D \u2192 E as follows:\n\u2022 on objects: \u03ba(d) = pF (d) \u25e6 \u03b4F (d) (d, 1F (d) ), and\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\n\u2022 on morphims: \u03ba(d \u2192 d\u2032 ) = pF (d\u2032 ) \u25e6 \u03b4F (d\u2032 ) ((d, F (\u03c3)) \u2192 (d\u2032 , 1F (d\u2032 ) ))\nThere is a natural transformation \u03b7 : G\u03ba \u2192 F whose component at d \u2208 ObD is\ngiven by the morphism \u03b4F (d) (d, 1F (d) ) in C. By functoriality, it can be verified that\n\u03b4 is induced by the pair (\u03ba, \u03b7), so F is full.\n\u0003\nRemark A.1.3. The inclusion of an object \u2217 \u2192 C defines an object in T (C).\nMoreover, there is a functor i : C op \u2192 T (C) that is defined on objects by the\ninclusion of the objects of C. The composite F \u25e6i is the classical Yoneda embedding.\nA.2. Lemma 2.2.1 revisited. We prove the following generalisation of Lemma\n2.2.1.\nProposition A.2.1. There is a natural homotopy equivalence\nR\n\u2243\n/ BD\nu(D,F ) : B( C F (D, F ))\nfor every (D, F ) \u2208 ObT (C).\nProof. The proof is Rsimilar to the (second) proof of Lemma 2.2.1. RThere is a\nforgetful functor U : C F (D, F ) \u2192 D.

Note that U G = 1 so that (BU )(BG) = 1 as well. The\npair (G, U ) defines an adjunction, so there is a natural transformation\n\u03c1 : GU \u2192 1\nR\nwhose components are as follows: given (c, d, \u03b1 : F d \u2192 c) \u2208 Ob( C F (D, F )), \u03c1c is\n(\u03b1, 1d ), i.e. the diagram\n1 /\nFd\nFd\n\u03b1\n\n1\n\n\u000f\n\nFd\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u000f\n/c\n\n\f28\n\nGEORGE RAPTIS\n\nIt follows that (BG)(BU ) \u2243 1, hence result.\n\n\u0003\n\nBy Proposition A.1.2, a natural transformation \u03bc : F (D, F ) \u2192 F (D\u2032 , F \u2032 ) is\ngiven by a morphism (\u03ba, \u03b7) : (D, F ) \u2192 (D\u2032 , F \u2032 ) in T (C). Let J be a small category\nand G : J \u2192 T (C) a functor. Associated to this, there is a functor\nGJ : C \u2192 Cat(T op)\ndefined on objects by\nc\u001f\n/\n\nR\n\nJ\n\nF (G\u2212)(c).\n\nHere F is the functor of Proposition A.1.2.

For every c \u2208 ObC,\nthere is a canonical functor\nR\n/ UG\nGJ (c)\nJ\n\nthat is induced by the canonical forgetful functors F (G(j))(c) \u2192 U (G(j)).\nA.3. W-fiber sequences. Let W be a class of morphisms in T op. A sequence of\nmaps\ni\n/E p /B\nF\ntogether with a homotopy H : pi \u2243 constb is called a W-fiber sequence if the\ncanonical map F \u2192 hofiberb (p) := E \u00d7B Path(B) is in W. Here Path(B) =\nM ap(([0, 1], {0}), (B, b)) and ev1 : Path(B) \u2192 B denotes the path fibration. Following [18], we also define a map f : E \u2192 B to be a local W-fibration if every\nb \u2208 B has arbitrarily small contractible neighborhoods U such that the inclusion\nf \u22121 (b\u2032 ) \u2192 f \u22121 (U ) is in W for all b\u2032 in U .\nWe will be interested in classes W that are closed under passage from the local\nto the global in the following sense.\nDefinition A.3.1. A class of morphisms W in T op is called a localiser 2 if the\nfollowing are satisfied:\n(a) W contains the weak homotopy equivalences and satisfies the \"2-out-of-3\"\nproperty,\n(b) W is closed under homotopy pushouts, i.e., given a diagram\nX1 o\n\ni1\n\n\u223c\n\n\u000f\nY1 o\n\nX0\n\u223c\n\ni2\n\n\u000f\nY0\n\n/ X2\n\u223c\n\n\u000f\n/ Y2\n\nwhere i1 and i2 are cofibrations and the vertical maps are in W, then\nX1 \u222aX0 X2 \u2192 Y1 \u222aY0 Y2 is also in W,\n(c) W is closed directed homotopy colimits, i.e., given a diagram\nX0\n\n/ X1\n\n/ ***\n\n/ Xn\n\n/ ***\n\n\u000f\nY0\n\n\u000f\n/ Y1\n\n/ ***\n\n\u000f\n/ Yn\n\n/ ***\n\n2The terminology is inspired by Grothendieck's theory of localisateurs in Cat, see [15].\n\n\fON THE HOMOTOPY TYPE OF CERTAIN COBORDISM CATEGORIES OF SURFACES 29\n\nwhere all the horizontal maps are cofibrations and the vertical maps are in\nW, then the canonical map colimn Xn \u2192 colimn Yn is in W.\nExample A.3.2. For every generalised homology theory E\u2217 that satisfies the limit\naxiom, the class of E\u2217 -equivalences of spaces defines a localiser on T op.\nLet W denote an arbitrary localiser in T op for the rest of this section.\nProposition A.3.3. If a map F : X. \u2192 Y. of good simplicial spaces is levelwise in\nW, then so is also its geometric realisation |F | : |X. | \u2192 |Y. |.\nProof. The realisation of a good simplicial space can be formed naturally as the\ndirected colimit of iterative pushouts along a cofibration [25, Appendix A]. Hence\nthe result follows from the properties of the localiser W.\n\u0003\nProposition A.3.4. If f : E \u2192 B is a local W-fibration and B is locally conf\ntractible and paracompact, then f \u22121 (b) \u2192 E \u2192 B is a W-fiber sequence.\nFirst, we prove the following key lemma.\nLemma A.3.5. Let I be a small category with weakly contractible nerve and F :\nI \u2192 T op be a diagram of spaces such that F (f ) is in W for every f \u2208 MorI. Then\nthe canonical map F (i) \u2192 hocolimI F is also in W for every i \u2208 ObI.\nProof. Let Simp(I) denote the category of simplices associated to the nerve of I.\nThere is a canonical projection functor \u01eb : Simp(I) \u2192 I which is homotopically\ncofinal, e.g. see [6]. It follows that the canonical map\nhocolimSimp(I) \u01eb\u2217 F \u2192 hocolimI F\nis a weak homotopy equivalence for every F : I \u2192 T op. This way we reduce to\nthe case of a simplex category. Every weakly contractible simplex category is the\ncolimit of pushouts along the horn inclusion of the simplex category of \u039bkn into the\nsimplex category of \u2206[n]. Then the result follows from the closure properties of\nlocalisers by similar arguments as in [6, Lemma 27.8].\n\u0003\nProposition A.3.6. Let f : E \u2192 B be as above and assume that B is contractible.\nThen f \u22121 (b) \u2192 E is in W for every b \u2208 B.\nProof. Let U = {U\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208J be a basis of contractible open sets U of B such that\nf \u22121 (b) \u2192 f \u22121 (U ) is in W for all b \u2208 U . Let IU denote the poset whose objects\nare the elements of the index set J and the order is defined by j 6 j \u2032 if Uj \u2286 Uj \u2032 .\nThe nerve N IU is contractible because it is homotopy equivalent to B, e.g. see\n[23]. Let F : IU \u2192 T op, j 7\u2192 f \u22121 (Uj ), be the functor of the induced numerable\n\u2243\nopen covering of E. There is a weak homotopy equivalence hocolimIU F \u2192 E (see\n[23]). Since W satisfies the \"2-out-of-3\" property, the functor F takes values in W.\nHence Lemma A.3.5 implies that the canonical map F (j) \u2192 hocolimIU F is a weak\nhomotopy equivalence. Then the result follows.\n\u0003\nProof of Proposition A.3.4. It follows from Proposition A.3.6 similarly with [18,\nProposition 5].\n\u0003\nWe can now state the generalisation of Theorem 2.3.5 for an arbitrary localiser\nW. We make the assumption that MorC is locally contractible and paracompact\nfrom now on.\n\n\f30\n\nGEORGE RAPTIS\n\nTheorem A.3.7. If F : C \u2192 Cat(T op) is a continuous functor such that BF (f )\nis in W for all f \u2208 MorC, then\nR\n/ BC\n/ B( F )\nB(F (c))\nC\nis a W-fiber sequence.\nProof. The method of the proof is very familiar [18], [31], [19]. We are going to\nproceed inductively on the skeleton of the thick realisation ||N C|| defined using only\nthe face maps. This has the same homotopy type as BC [25, Appendix A]. The\nn-skeleton ||N C||n is obtained inductively as the homotopy pushout\ncolim(||N C||n\u22121 \u2190 \u2202\u2206[n] \u00d7 Nn C \u0592\u2192 \u2206[n] \u00d7 Nn C)\nwhere the left hand-side map Ris defined using the face maps. For n = 0, we have\nthe sequence B(F (c)) \u2192 Ob( C F ) \u2192 ObC, which is clearly a W-fiber sequence.\nBy the property (b) of localisers, the sequence of maps\nB(F (c))\n\n/ ||N (C \u2240 BF )||n\n\n/ ||N C||n\n\nis a local W-fibration, and so also a W-fiber sequence by Proposition A.3.4 (compare\nwith [18, Proposition 3] and [19, Proposition 2.2]). Then the result follows from\nthe property (c) of localisers (compare with [19, Proposition 2.3]) and Proposition\n2.1.1.\n\u0003\nRemark A.3.8. We note that for the purpose of applying Theorem A.3.7, the\nadditional point-set topological assumptions on C can be assumed without loss of\ngenerality. This is because every C (as in A.1) admits a \"CW-approximation\" from\n \u0303 is a CW-complex\nthe left, i.e. there is new topological category C \u0303 such that Mor(C)\n(and satisfies the assumptions of A.1) together with a continuous functor Q : C \u0303 \u2192 C\nthat induces a weak homotopy equivalence between all morphism spaces. The\nconstruction of C \u0303 is done by applying the singular chains functor S\u2217 : T op \u2192 sSet\nfollowed by the geometric realisation |\u2212 | : sSet \u2192 T op on the individual morphism\nspaces of C. Since both functors preserve pullbacks, this produces a well-defined\ntopological category C \u0303 together with a continuous functor Q : C \u0303 \u2192 C induced by\nthe counit map | \u2212 | \u25e6 S\u2217 \u2192 1T op which is a pointwise weak homotopy equivalence\nof functors.\nThe last theorem has two important consequences. The first one is a generalisation of Quillen's Theorem B [20].\nTheorem A.3.9. Let F : D \u2192 C be an object in T (C). If B(u\u2217 ) : B(D \u2193 c) \u2192\nB(D \u2193 c\u2032 ) is in W for every u : c \u2192 c\u2032 in C, then B(D \u2193 c) \u2192 BD \u2192 BC is a\nW-fiber sequence.\nProof. The diagram F (D, F ) : C \u2192 Cat(T op) satisfies the conditions of Theorem\nA.3.7, so the sequence\nR\n/ BC\n/ B( F (D, F ))\nB(D \u2193 c)\nC\nis a W-fiber sequence. By Lemma A.2.1, there is a canonical homotopy equivalence\nR\n\u2243\n\u0003\nB( C F (D, F )) \u2192 BD, hence the result follows.\nWe also have a generalisation of Theorem 2.3.6 for an arbitrary localiser W.\n\n\fON THE HOMOTOPY TYPE OF CERTAIN COBORDISM CATEGORIES OF SURFACES 31\n\nDefinition A.3.10. A diagram G : J \u2192 T (C) is called W-stable if for every\nmorphism u : c \u2192 c\u2032 in C, the map BGJ (c) \u2192 BGJ (c\u2032 ) is in W.\nTheorem A.3.11. If G : J \u2192 T (C) is a W-stable diagram, then there is W-fiber\nsequence\nR\nBGJ (c) \u2192 B J (U G) \u2192 BC\nfor every c \u2208 ObC.\nProof. This follows from Theorem A.3.7 and Proposition A.2.1 with the same arguments as in the proof of Theorem 2.3.6.\n\u0003\nAcknowledgements\nThis work is a part of my D.Phil. thesis.
