Bergman\nTo the memory of Ivan Rival\nAbstract. Properties of several sorts of lattices of convex subsets of Rn are examined.\nThe lattice of convex sets containing the origin turns out, for n > 1, to satisfy a set of\nidentities strictly between those of the lattice of all convex subsets of Rn and the lattice\nof all convex subsets of Rn\u22121 . The lattices of arbitrary, of open bounded, and of compact\nconvex sets in Rn all satisfy the same identities, but the last of these is join-semidistributive,\nwhile for n > 1 the first two are not. The lattice of relatively convex subsets of a fixed set\nS \u2286 Rn satisfies some, but in general not all of the identities of the lattice of \"genuine\"\nconvex subsets of Rn .\n\n1. Notation, conventions, remarks.\nFor S a subset of Rn , the convex hull of S will be denoted\nc.h.(S) = {\u03a3m\ni=1 \u03bbi pi | m \u2265 1, pi \u2208 S, \u03bbi \u2208 [0, 1], \u03a3 \u03bbi = 1}.\n\n(1)\n\nWhen S is written as a list of elements \"{ ... },\" we will generally simplify \"c.h.({ ... })\"\nto \"c.h.( ... )\".\nConv(Rn ) will denote the lattice of all convex subsets of Rn ; its lattice operations are\nx \u2227 y = x \u2229 y,\nx \u2228 y = c.h.(x \u222a y).\n(2)\nIn any lattice,\nif a finite family of elements yi has been specified, then an expression\nV\nsuch as i yi will denote the meet over the full\nV range of the index i, and similarly\nfor joins. Likewise, if we write something like j6=i yj where i has been quantified\noutside this expression, then the meet will be over all values of j in the indexing\nfamily other than i. If L is any lattice and x an element of L, or, more generally,\nof an overlattice of L, we define the sublattice\nL\u2265x = {y \u2208 L | y \u2265 x}.\n\n(3)\n\nIn particular, Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} is the lattice of those convex subsets of Rn that\ncontain the origin.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classifications.

BERGMAN\n\nIf A is a class of lattices, V(A) will denote the variety of lattices generated\nby A, that is, the class of lattices satisfying all identities (in the binary operations\n\u2227 and \u2228) that hold in all lattices in A. Again, for A given as a list, we will\nabbreviate V({ ... }) to V( ... ). (Most often A will be a singleton {L}, so that\nwe will write V(L).)\nGiven sets x and y, we will write x \u2212 y for their set-theoretic difference, {p |\np \u2208 x, p \u2208\n/ y}.\nThough I am not an expert either in lattice theory or in convex sets, I know\nmore about the former subject than the latter; hence, I may more often state\nexplicitly facts known to every worker in convex sets than those known to every\nlattice-theorist. I hope this note will nevertheless be of interest to people in both\nfields. I have no present plans of carrying these investigations further; others are\nwelcome to do so.\nSince obtaining the main results of this paper, I have learned that many of\nthem were already in the literature, and have added references; thus, this is now\na hybrid research/survey paper. I am grateful to Kira Adaricheva, J. B. Nation,\nMarina Semenova, Fred Wehrung, and the referee, for corrections, information on\nthe literature, and many other helpful comments.\nWhereas this note looks at conditions satisfied universally in various lattices of\nconvex sets, the papers [1], [19], and others cited there study sufficient conditions\nfor lattices to be embeddable in such lattices, in other words, existential properties\nof such lattices. (This note includes one result of that type, in \u00a713.)\n2. n-Distributivity.\nThe varieties of lattices we will be examining in the first few sections are those\nlisted in\nLemma 1. Each lattice in the sequence Conv(R0 )\u2265{0} , Conv(R0 ), Conv(R1 )\u2265{0} ,\n. . . , Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} , Conv(Rn ), . . . is embeddable in the next. Hence\nV(Conv(R0 )\u2265{0} ) \u2286 V(Conv(R0 )) \u2286 V(Conv(R1 )\u2265{0} ) \u2286 V(Conv(R1 ))\n\n(4)\n\n\u2286 * * * \u2286 V(Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} ) \u2286 V(Conv(Rn )) \u2286 . . . .\nProof. On the one hand, Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} is a sublattice of Conv(Rn ); on the other,\none can embed Conv(Rn ) in Conv(Rn+1 )\u2265{0} by sending each x \u2208 Conv(Rn ) to\nthe cone c.h.({0} \u222a {(p1 , . . . , pn , 1) | (p1 , . . . , pn ) \u2208 x}). The inclusions (4) follow\nfrom these embeddings.\n\u0003\nClearly Conv(R0 )\u2265{0} is a trivial lattice with unique element {0}; on the other\nhand, Conv(R0 ) is a two-element lattice, so V(Conv(R0 )) is the variety of distributive lattices. Hence the first inclusion of (4) is strict. We shall see below that\nthe next inclusion is an equality, while all subsequent inclusions are again strict.\nLet us set up notation for some lattice identities.\n\n\fON LATTICES OF CONVEX SETS IN Rn\n\n3\n\nDefinition 2 (after Huhn [11]). For each positive integer n, we shall denote by\nDn (x, y1 , . . . , yn+1 )  \u030a\n(for \" n-distributivity\" \u030a\n) the lattice-relation in n+2 arguments\nx, y1 , . . . , yn+1 ,\nW\nW\nW\n(5)\nx \u2227 ( i yi ) = i (x \u2227 j6=i yj ).\nWe shall say that a lattice L satisfies \"the identity Dn\" if (5) holds for all x, y1 ,\n. . . , yn+1 \u2208 L.\nThus, D1 is the ordinary distributivity identity.\nThe use of the subscript n for an identity in n+2 variables which is symmetric\nin n+1 of these may seem confusing; a useful mnemonic is that Dn is the identity\nthat allows one to \"reduce meets of x with larger joins to meets of x with n-fold\njoins\". An additional occasion for confusion will arise when we see that the first of\nthese identities to be satisfied by Conv(Rn ) is not Dn , but Dn+1 . This will be a\nconsequence of the fact that an n-dimensional simplex has n+1 vertices.\nNote that the left-hand side of (5) is \u2265 the right-hand side for any family of\nelements of any lattice, since each of the n+1 terms in the outer join on the right\nis majorized by the left-hand side. So to verify any instance of (5) it suffices to\nprove \" \u2264\".\nThe pioneering work on identities satisfied by lattices of convex sets was done\nby A. P. Huhn [10], [11]. The results in this and the next three sections will extend\nHuhn's by approximately doubling both the family of lattices and the family of\nidentities considered, and formalizing some general techniques. Huhn's results will\nbe recovered along with our new ones.\nThe key to Huhn's and our results on Dn (and some related identities) is the\nfollowing standard result in the theory of convex sets. Strictly speaking, it is the\nfirst sentence below that is Carath\u00e9odory's theorem, while the second is a wellknown refinement thereof [6, p.431, line 4]. Intuitively, that second sentence says\nthat from an arbitrary point p0 \u2208 S \u2286 Rn , we can \"see\" any other point of c.h.(S)\nagainst a background of (or embedded in) some (n\u22121)-simplex with vertices in S.\nCarath\u00e9odory's Theorem. If S is a subset of Rn , then each element q \u2208 c.h.(S)\nbelongs to c.h.(p0 , . . . , pn ) for some n+1 points p0 , . . . , pn \u2208 S. Moreover, p0 can\nbe taken to be any pre-specified element of S.\n\u0003\nIn each paragraph of the next lemma, it is the first assertion that is due to Huhn.\nLemma 3 (cf. Huhn [11]). For every natural number n and (n+3)-tuple of convex\nsets x, y1 , . . . , yn+2 \u2208 Conv(Rn ), the relation Dn+1 (x, y1 , . . . , yn+2 ) holds. Moreover, if n > 0 and  \u030a\n(at least \u030a\n) some two of the sets y1 , . . . , yn+1 have nonempty\nintersection, then Dn (x, y1 , . . . , yn+1 ) holds.\nHence Conv(Rn ) satisfies the identity Dn+1 , and for n > 0, Conv(Rn )\u2265{0}\nsatisfies the identity Dn .\nProof. We shall prove the assertions of the first paragraph, which clearly imply\nthose of the second.\nTo get the first assertion, let x, y1 , . . . , yn+2 \u2208 Conv(Rn ), and let p be a point\nof the convex set described by the left-hand side of (5). Then p belongs to both x\n\n\f4\n\nGEORGE M. BERGMAN\n\nS\nW\nTheorem now says that p belongs to the\nand i yi = c.h.( i yi ). Carath\u00e9odory's\nS\nconvex hull of n+1 points of i yi , hence to the join of at most n+1 of the yi ,\nso it belongs to one of the terms on the right-hand side of (5), hence to their join,\nas required.\nTo prove the second assertion, let x, y1 , . . . , yn+1 \u2208 Conv(Rn ), and suppose\nthat two of y1 , . . . , yn+1 have a point p0 in common. Given p in the left-hand\nside of the desired instance of (5), we see from the last sentence of our statement of\nCarath\u00e9odory's S\nTheorem that p will belong to the convex hull of p0 and some n\nother points of i yi . The latter points will lie in the union of some n of the y 's,\nand since those n of our n+1 sets leave out only one, they do not leave out both\nof the sets known to contain p0 . So that family of n y 's contains the n+1 points\nwhose convex hull is known to contain p, and the conclusion follows as before. \u0003\nNote that for all p \u2208 Rn , we have Conv(Rn )\u2265{p} \u223c\n= Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} ; moreover, if\nn\nn\nn\np \u2208 S \u2286 R , then Conv(R )\u2265S \u2286 Conv(R )\u2265{p} . Thus, any identities proved for\nthe lattice Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} will hold in Conv(Rn )\u2265S for every nonempty set S.\nOne may ask whether, in the first assertion of the above lemma, we have failed\nto use the full strength of Carath\u00e9odory's Theorem. That theorem says that the\nconvex hull of any family of N > n+1 points is the union of the hulls of its (n+1)element subfamilies, hence for each such N, we may deduce an identity like Dn+1 ,\nbut with the join of N rather than n+2 convex sets yi on the left, and expressions\ninvolving all the (n+1)-fold subjoins thereof on the right. Our Dn+1 is the case\nN = n+2.\nBut in fact, the identities so obtained are all equivalent to Dn+1 . To derive them\nfrom it, note first that if in Dn+1 we substitute for yn+2 the expression yn+2 \u2228yn+3 ,\nWn+3\nthen the left-hand side becomes x \u2227 ( i=1 yi ), while on the right, some of the joins\ninvolve n+1 of the y 's and others involve n+2. If we again apply Dn+1 to the\nlatter joins, we get precisely the N = n+3 case of the class of identities discussed\nabove. The identities with still larger N are gotten by repeating this argument.\nConversely, one can get Dn+1 from any of these identities by substituting for the\nyi with i > n+2 repetitions of yn+2 , and discarding from the outer join on the\nright-hand side joinands majorized by others.\nLet us also note that Dn+1 =\u21d2 Dn+2 . Indeed, the identity with n+3 y 's that\nwe just showed equivalent to Dn+1 has the same left-hand side as Dn+2 , while\nthe right-hand side of Dn+2 can be seen to lie, in an arbitrary lattice, between the\ntwo sides of that identity. In particular, the identities obtained in Lemma 3 are\nsuccessively weaker for larger n, as is reasonable in view of (4).\nThe argument proving Lemma 3 (for simplicity let us limit ourselves to the first\nassertion thereof) can be formulated in a more general context, and the above\nobservations on identities allow us to obtain a converse in that context, which we\nrecord below, though we shall not use it. Recall that a closure operator on a set\nX is called \"finitary\" (or \"algebraic\") if the closure of every subset S \u2286 X is the\nunion of the closures of the finite subsets of S.\nLemma 4 (cf. [16]). Let cl be a finitary closure operator on a set X, such that\nevery singleton subset of X is closed, or more generally, such that the closure\n\n\fON LATTICES OF CONVEX SETS IN Rn\n\n5\n\nof every singleton is join-irreducible; and let n be a positive integer. Then the\nlattice of closed subsets of X under cl satisfies Dn if and only if cl has the\n\" n-Carath\u00e9odory property\" that the closure of every set is the union of the closures\nof its \u2264n-element subsets.\nProof. \"If\" is shown exactly as in the proof of Lemma 3.\nConversely, suppose the lattice of cl-closed subsets of X satisfies Dn , and let\np \u2208 cl(S) for some S \u2286 X. By the assumption that cl is finitary, p \u2208 cl(q1 , . . . , qN )\nfor some q1 , . . . , qN \u2208 S. If N \u2264 n, we are done; if not,Wlet us rewrite the condition\np \u2208 cl(q1 , . . . , qN ) as a lattice relation, cl(p) = cl(p) \u2227 ( i cl(qi )). By the preceding\ndiscussion, Dn implies the identity in N variables which, when applied to the\nright-hand side of the above relation, turns the relation into\nW\nW\ncl(p) = |I|=n (cl(p) \u2227 ( i\u2208I cl(qi ))),\nwhere the subscript to the outer join means that I ranges over all n-element subsets\nof {1, . . . , N }. Now by assumption cl(p) is join-irreducible, hence it equals one of\nthe joinands on the right, showing p to be in the closure of some set of n q 's, as\nrequired.\n\u0003\n3. Tools for studying related identities.\nWe also appear to have used less than the full force of the middle sentence of\nLemma 3 (the stronger relation holding when at least two of the y 's have nonempty\nintersection) in getting the second assertion of the last sentence of that lemma (the\nstronger identity for Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} ), since the latter assertion concerns the case\nwhere not just two, but all the yi (and also x) have a point in common. There is\nno evident way to take advantage of the weaker hypothesis of said middle sentence\nwhen working in the lattice Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} ; but might we be able to use it to prove\nsome new identity for Conv(Rn ); for example, by finding a relation that holds, on\nthe one hand, whenever a family of elements x, y1 , . . . , yn+1 satisfies Dn , and also,\nfor some trivial reason, whenever y1 \u2227 y2 = \u2205 ?\nOne relation with these properties can be obtained by taking the meet of each\nside of Dn with y1 \u2227 y2 . Unfortunately, this turns out to be the trivial identity:\nboth sides simplify to x \u2227 y1 \u2227 y2 in any lattice. However, we can circumvent this\nby first taking the join of both sides of Dn with a new indeterminate z, and only\nthen taking meets with y1 \u2227 y2 .\nWe shall in fact see that this provides what Lemma 3 failed to: an identity\nholding in Conv(Rn ) but not in Conv(Rn+1 )\u2265{0} . However, the verification of an\nexample showing the failure of this identity in the larger lattice (and of a similar\nexample we will need later) is messy if done entirely \"by hand\"; so we shall establish\nin this section some general criteria for certain sorts of inequalities to be strict.\nThe last assertions of the next two lemmas clearly imply, for Conv(Rn ) and\nConv(Rn+1 )\u2265{0} respectively, that if we are given expressions u, v and w in\nsome lattice indeterminates such that the inequality u \u2265 v is known to hold identically in our lattice, then we can write down another inequality holding identically\n\n\f6\n\nGEORGE M. BERGMAN\n\namong expressions in a slightly larger set of indeterminates, for which equality will\nhold whenever either u equals v, or w equals the least lattice-element (i.e., \u2205,\nrespectively {0}), but which will fail in all other cases. This is what is logically\ncalled for by the program sketched above. However the earlier parts of these lemmas give some simpler inequalities for which the same is true if the hypotheses hold\n\"in a sufficiently strong way\", and it will turn out that in the applications where\nwe need to show failure of an identity, we will be able to use these simpler formulas.\nIn the statements of these lemmas, for p, q \u2208 Rn , \"the ray drawn from q through\np\" will mean {\u03bbp + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)q | 0 \u2264 \u03bb < \u221e}, even in the degenerate case p = q,\nwhere this set is the singleton {p}.\nLemma 5. Let n be any natural number, and let u \u2265 v and w be three elements\nof Conv(Rn ). Then\n(i) The following conditions are equivalent:\n(a) There exists z \u2208 Conv(Rn ) such that (u \u2228 z) \u2227 w > (v \u2228 z) \u2227 w.\n(b) There exist a point p \u2208 u and a point q \u2208 w such that the ray drawn from\nq through p contains no point of v.\n(ii) The following conditions are equivalent:\n(a) There exist z, z \u2032 \u2208 Conv(Rn ) such that ((u \u2227 z \u2032 ) \u2228 z) \u2227 w > ((v \u2227 z \u2032 ) \u2228 z) \u2227 w.\n(b) u > v, and w is nonempty.\nProof. In view of the hypothesis u \u2265 v, the relation \" \u2265\" always holds in the\ninequalities of (i)(a) and (ii)(a), so in each case, strict inequality is equivalent to\nthe existence of a point q belonging to the left-hand side but not to the right-hand\nside.\nSuppose, first, that (i)(a) holds for some z; thus we get a point q belonging to\nu \u2228 z and to w but not to v \u2228 z. Note that the latter condition implies that q does\nnot lie in z. If q lies in u, then (i)(b) is satisfied with p = q, so assume q \u2208\n/ u.\nHence, being in the convex hull of u and z but in neither set, q must lie on the\nline-segment c.h.(p, r) for some p \u2208 u, r \u2208 z :\np\n\u275c\n\u2208u\n\nq\n\u275c\n\u2208 (u \u2228 z) \u2227 w\n\u2208\n/ v\u2228z\n\nr\n\u275c\n\u2208z\n\nNow if a point s \u2208 v lay on the ray drawn from q through p, we would have\nq \u2208 c.h.(s, r) \u2286 v \u2228 z, contradicting our assumption that q \u2208\n/ v \u2228 z. This proves (b).\nConversely, if we are given p and q as in (i)(b), take z = {2q \u2212 p} :\np\n\u275c\n\u2208u\n\nq\n\u275c\n\u2208w\n\n2q \u2212 p\n\u275c\n\u2208z\n\nThus q \u2208 (u \u2228 z) \u2227 w, but we claim that q \u2208\n/ v \u2228 z. Indeed, if q belonged to this\nset, then v would have to meet the ray from the unique point 2q \u2212 p of z through\n\n\fON LATTICES OF CONVEX SETS IN Rn\n\n7\n\nq on the other side of q; i.e., it would meet the ray drawn from q through p,\ncontradicting our choice of p and q as in (b). Hence q belongs to the left-hand\nbut not the right-hand side of the inequality of (a), as required.\nNote that (i)(b), and hence (i)(a), holds whenever u and w are nonempty and\nv is empty.\nNow in the situation of (ii)(b), if we take any p \u2208 u \u2212 v and let z \u2032 = {p}, then\nu \u2227 z \u2032 and v \u2227 z \u2032 are respectively nonempty and empty, so applying the preceding\nobservation with these two sets in the roles of u and v, we get (ii)(a). The reverse\nimplication is trivial.\n\u0003\nThe result we shall prove for Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} is similar. Indeed, in the lemma\nbelow, part (i) is exactly as in the preceding lemma; but (ii) becomes two statements, (ii) and (iii), the former having the same \"(a)\" as in (ii) above but a stronger\n\"(b)\", the latter a weaker \"(a)\" and the same \"(b)\" as above. Note also the restriction on n (only needed for (iii)).\nLemma 6. Let n > 1, and let u \u2265 v and w be three elements of Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} .\nThen\n(i) The following conditions are equivalent:\n(a) There exists z \u2208 Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} such that (u \u2228 z) \u2227 w > (v \u2228 z) \u2227 w.\n(b) There exist a point p \u2208 u and a point q \u2208 w such that the ray drawn from\nq through p contains no point of v.\n(ii) The following conditions are equivalent:\n(a) There exist z, z \u2032 \u2208 Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} such that\n((u \u2227 z \u2032 ) \u2228 z) \u2227 w > ((v \u2227 z \u2032 ) \u2228 z) \u2227 w.\n(b) There exist a point p \u2208 u and a point q \u2208 w such that the ray drawn from\nq through p contains no point of v \u2227 c.h.(0, p).\n(iii) The following conditions are equivalent:\n(a) There exist z, z \u2032 , z \u2032\u2032 , z \u2032\u2032\u2032 \u2208 Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} such that\n((((u \u2227 z \u2032\u2032\u2032 ) \u2228 z \u2032\u2032 ) \u2227 z \u2032 ) \u2228 z) \u2227 w > ((((v \u2227 z \u2032\u2032\u2032 ) \u2228 z \u2032\u2032 ) \u2227 z \u2032 ) \u2228 z) \u2227 w.\n(b) u > v, and w 6= {0}.\nProof. (i)(a) =\u21d2 (i)(b) holds by the preceding lemma. In proving the reverse implication, we cannot set z = {2q \u2212 p} as we did there, so let z = c.h.(0, 2q \u2212 p).\nAs before, we have q \u2208 (u \u2228 z) \u2227 w and need to show q \u2208\n/ v \u2228 z. If the contrary\nwere true, then q would be a convex linear combination of 0, 2q \u2212 p, and a point\nr \u2208 v. This can be rewritten as a convex linear combination of 2q \u2212p with a convex\nlinear combination of 0 and r; but the latter combination would also be a point\nof v, and, as in the previous proof, would lie on the ray drawn from q through p,\ncontradicting our choice of p and q as in (b).\nTurning to (ii), if (ii)(a) holds then we can apply (i)(a) =\u21d2 (i)(b) with u \u2227 z \u2032\nand v \u2227 z \u2032 in place of u and v, and the resulting p and q will satisfy (ii)(b)\n(since v \u2227 c.h.(0, p) \u2286 v \u2227 z \u2032 ). Inversely, if (ii)(b) holds, take z \u2032 = c.h.(0, p), and\napply (i)(b) =\u21d2 (i)(a) with u \u2227 z \u2032 and v \u2227 z \u2032 in place of u and v.\n\n\f8\n\nGEORGE M. BERGMAN\n\nIn statement (iii), it is clear that (a) implies (b). To prove the converse, let us\nassume (iii)(b), and consider two cases, according to whether the stronger statement (ii)(b) holds. If it does, we get the inequality of (ii)(a), from which we can\nimmediately get that of (iii)(a) by choosing z \u2032\u2032\u2032 and z \u2032\u2032 to \"have no effect\" (e.g.,\nby taking them to be u and v respectively). On the other hand, if (ii)(b) fails\nwhile (iii)(b) holds, it is easy to see that all elements of w and u \u2212 v must lie on a\ncommon line x through 0. In that case, we want to use z \u2032\u2032\u2032 and z \u2032\u2032 to \"perturb\"\nu and v, so that the modified u has points off the line x, while being careful to\npreserve the property that u is strictly larger than v. To do this, we begin by taking any point p \u2208 u \u2212 v, letting z \u2032\u2032\u2032 = c.h.(0, p), and noting that the intersections\nof u and v with this segment are still distinct. Now taking any point r not on\nthe line x (it is for this that we need n > 1), and letting z \u2032\u2032 = c.h.(0, r), we see\nthat (u \u2227 z \u2032\u2032\u2032 ) \u2228 z \u2032\u2032 and (v \u2227 z \u2032\u2032\u2032 ) \u2228 z \u2032\u2032 remain distinct, and that their difference now\nhas points off x. Hence (ii)(b) holds with these sets in the roles of u and v, and\nthe implication (ii)(b) =\u21d2 (ii)(a) gives the z and z \u2032 needed for (iii)(a).\n\u0003\nOne can get criteria similar to those of the preceding lemmas for other conditions.\nAt the trivial end, given u \u2208 Conv(Rn ), a condition for u to be nonempty is that\nthere exist a z such that u \u2228 z > z, and likewise the condition for at least one of\ntwo elements u and v to be nonempty is that their join have this property. The\nexercise below offers, for the diversion of the interested reader, some less trivial\ncases. (We will not use the results of this exercise.)\nExercise 7. (i) Find an inequality in elements u, v and one or more additional\nlattice variables z, . . . , which holds identically in lattices, and which, for any u, v \u2208\nConv(Rn ), is strict for some values of the additional variables if and only if both\nu and v are nonempty.\n(ii) Find an inequality in elements u, v, w, x and additional variables which holds\nin any lattice when u \u2265 v, w \u2265 x, and which, for any such u, v, w, x \u2208 Conv(Rn ),\nis strict for some values of the additional variables if and only if u > v and w > x.\n(iii) Same as (ii), but with \" u > v and w > x\" replaced by \" u > v or w > x\".\n(iv)-(vi) Like (i)-(iii), but for Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} , and with \"nonzero\" in place of \"nonempty\"\nin (i).\n(vii) In Lemma 6, conditions (i)(a), (ii)(a) and (iii)(a) involved 1, 2 and 4 z's respectively; thus the condition that there exist three elements z, z \u2032 , z \u2032\u2032 \u2208 Conv(Rn )\u2265{0}\nsuch that\n(((u \u2228 z \u2032\u2032 ) \u2227 z \u2032 ) \u2228 z) \u2227 w > (((v \u2228 z \u2032\u2032 ) \u2227 z \u2032 ) \u2228 z) \u2227 w\nwas skipped. Show by example that this condition is not equivalent to (iii)(b).\n(viii) Suppose u \u2265 v and w are elements of Conv(Rn ), and consider the conditions\ndual to (i)(a)-(iii)(a) of Lemma 6, and to the \"skipped\" condition:\n(a) There exists z \u2208 Conv(Rn ) such that (u \u2227 z) \u2228 w > (v \u2227 z) \u2228 w.\n(a\u2032 ) There exist z, z \u2032 \u2208 Conv(Rn ) such that ((u \u2228 z \u2032 ) \u2227 z) \u2228 w > ((v \u2228 z \u2032 ) \u2227 z) \u2228 w.\n(a\u2032\u2032 ) There exist z, z \u2032 , z \u2032\u2032 \u2208 Conv(Rn ) such that\n(((u \u2227 z \u2032\u2032 ) \u2228 z \u2032 ) \u2227 z) \u2228 w > (((v \u2227 z \u2032\u2032 ) \u2228 z \u2032 ) \u2227 z) \u2228 w.\n\n\fON LATTICES OF CONVEX SETS IN Rn\n\n9\n\n(a\u2032\u2032\u2032 ) There exist z, z \u2032 , z \u2032\u2032 , z \u2032\u2032\u2032 \u2208 Conv(Rn ) such that\n((((u \u2228 z \u2032\u2032\u2032 ) \u2227 z \u2032\u2032 ) \u2228 z \u2032 ) \u2227 z) \u2228 w > ((((v \u2228 z \u2032\u2032\u2032 ) \u2227 z \u2032\u2032 ) \u2228 z \u2032 ) \u2227 z) \u2228 w.\nWhich of these, if any, are equivalent, for all such u, v and w, to the condition\n(b) u > v, and w 6= Rn ?\nNow, back to business.\n4. Identities distinguishing our chain of lattices.\nGiven n > 0, let us write ((Dn ) \u2228 z) \u2227 y1 \u2227 y2 for the equation in n+3 variables\nx, y1 , . . . , yn+1 , z obtained by applying the operator ((\u2212) \u2228 z) \u2227 y1 \u2227 y2 to both\nsides of the relation Dn . We can now prove\nTheorem 8. For each positive integer n, Conv(Rn ) satisfies ((Dn )\u2228z)\u2227y1 \u2227y2 but\nnot Dn , while Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} satisfies Dn but, if n > 1, not ((Dn\u22121 )\u2228z)\u2227y1 \u2227y2 .\nHence every inclusion in (4) is strict except the second. Equality holds at that\nstep.\nProof. To see that equality holds at the second inclusion of (4), note that both\nConv(R0 ) and Conv(R1 )\u2265{0} are nontrivial lattices, which by Lemma 3 satisfy\nD1 , the distributive identity, and that the variety of distributive lattices is known\nto have no proper nontrivial subvarieties.\nThe positive assertions of the first paragraph of the theorem follow from Lemma 3,\ncombined, in the case of the first of these results, with the observations of the first\ntwo paragraphs of \u00a73. (Those observations are equivalent to the contrapositive of\nthe easy implications (i)(a) =\u21d2 (ii)(a) =\u21d2 (ii)(b) of Lemma 5.) It remains to give\nexamples showing the negative assertions.\nTo see that Conv(Rn ) does not satisfy Dn , let q1 , . . . , qn+1 be the vertices of\nan n-simplex in Rn and p an interior point of this simplex, and take for the yi\nand x the singletons {qi } and {p} respectively. Then we see that the left-hand\nside of Dn (x, y1 , . . . , yn+1 ) gives x, while all the joinands on the right are empty,\nhence so is the right-hand side itself.\nTo show that Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} does not satisfy ((Dn\u22121 ) \u2228 z) \u2227 y1 \u2227 y2 when n > 1,\nlet P \u2286 Rn be a hyperplane not passing through 0. The idea will be to mimic\nthe preceding example within P, then replace the resulting singleton sets with the\nline-segments connecting them with 0, slightly enlarge y1 , so that it has nonzero\nintersection with y2 , and finally apply part (i) of Lemma 6.\nSo let q1 , . . . , qn be the vertices of an (n\u22121)-simplex in P, and p a point in the\nrelative interior of that simplex, and let x and the yi be the line segments c.h.(0, p)\nand c.h.(0, qi ) respectively, except for y1 , which we take to be c.h.(0, q1 , q2 /2).\nNote that all of these convex sets lie in the closed half-space H bounded by P\nand containing 0; hence the intersection with P of any lattice expression in these\nconvex sets can be computed as the corresponding lattice expression in their intersections with P. We see that these intersections are a configuration of the form\ngiven in the preceding example, except that the dimension is lower by 1 (note that\n\n\f10\n\nGEORGE M. BERGMAN\n\nthe point \" q2 /2\" in our definition of y1 , not lying in P, does not affect the intersection y1 \u2229 P ). Hence when we evaluate the two sides of Dn\u22121 at these elements,\nthe left-hand side intersects P in the point p, and is thus the whole line-segment\nx, while the right-hand side does not meet P, hence is a proper subsegment of x.\nWe can now deduce the failure of ((Dn\u22121 ) \u2228 z) \u2227 y1 \u2227 y2 from the implication\n(i)(b) =\u21d2 (i)(a) of Lemma 6, using for u and v respectively the left and right sides\nof Dn\u22121 , and for w the set y1 \u2227y2 . To see that (i)(b) holds for these sets, note that\nw is the line-segment c.h.(0, q2 /2). Since this lies in a different line through the\norigin from p, the ray drawn from any nonzero point q of that segment through\np does not meet the line-segment x in any point other than p, so in particular, it\ndoes not contain any point of v, the right-hand side of Dn\u22121 , which we saw was\na proper subset of x.\n\u0003\nWe remark that by alternately inserting joins and meets with more and more\nvariables z (m) into \"((Dn ) . . . )\u2227(y1 \u2227y2 )\" one can get identities that, formally, are\nsuccessively stronger (though still all implied by Dn ), so that the statements that\na lattice does not satisfy these identities become successively weaker. Thus, as a\nstronger version of the above theorem, we could have stated that Conv(Rn ) satisfies\nsuch identities with arbitrarily long strings of inserted terms, while Conv(Rn )\u2265{0}\nfails to satisfy the particular one given above. But for simplicity, I used just one\nidentity to distinguish the properties of these lattices.\nThe argument at the beginning of the preceding section showing that Conv(Rn )\nsatisfies ((Dn ) \u2228 z) \u2227 y1 \u2227 y2 also clearly shows that it satisfies the formally stronger\nidentity\nW\n(6)\n((Dn ) \u2228 z) \u2227 ( i,j; i 6= j yi \u2227 yj ).\nWith a little additional work one can get the still stronger identity:\nV W\n(7)\n((Dn ) \u2228 z) \u2227 i ( j6=i yj ).\nV W\n(Idea: If i ( j6=i yj ) is nonempty, use a point thereof as the p0 in the second\nsentence of Carath\u00e9odory's Theorem.)\nWe remark that the fact that Conv(Rn ) satisfies the identity DW\nn+1 says that\nfor any n+2 convex sets yi , the union of the (n+1)-fold joins j6=i yj (i =\n1, . . . , n+2) is itself convex, while (7) says essentially that the same holds for the\nunion of the n-fold joins of n+1 convex sets, if those unions have at least one point\nin common.\n5. Dual n-distributivity.\nHuhn showed not only that Conv(Rn ) satisfies Dn+1 , but also that it satisfies\nthe dual of that identity. Let us write the dual of the relation Dn (x, y1 , . . . , yn+1 )\nas\nV\nV\nV\n(8)\nDnop (x, y1 , . . . , yn+1 ) : x \u2228 ( i yi ) = i (x \u2228 j6=i yj ).\nop\nJust as in Dn the direction \u2265 is automatic, so \u2264 is automatic in Dn .\nop\nBelow, we will strengthen Huhn's result that Dn+1\nholds identically in Conv(Rn )\nby showing that it holds in the larger lattice Conv(Rn+1 )\u2265{0} , and will again use\n\n\fON LATTICES OF CONVEX SETS IN Rn\n\n11\n\nthe method of \u00a73 to manufacture a related identity which holds in Conv(Rn ) but\nnot in Conv(Rn+1 )\u2265{0} . Like Huhn, we start with\nHelly's Theorem ([6], p.391). Let n \u2265 0. If a finite family of convex subsets of\nRn has the property that every n+1 of them have nonempty intersection, then the\nwhole family has nonempty intersection.\n\u0003\nWe will also use the following observation.\nLemma 9. Let V be any real vector space. Given a convex set x and a point p\nin V, there exists a convex set w in V such that for every nonempty convex set\ny, one has p \u2208 x \u2228 y if and only if y has nonempty intersection with w.\nProof. It is straightforward to check that a set w with the required property (in\nfact, the unique such set) is the cone consisting of the union of all rays from p\nwhich meet the central reflection of x through p. (If p \u2208 x then w = V ; in\nvisualizing the contrary case, it is convenient to assume without loss of generality\nthat p = 0.)\n\u0003\nWe can now show that certain sorts of families of convex sets satisfy the relation\nDnop , from which we will deduce our identities.\nLemma 10. Let n be a natural number, and x, y1 , . . . , yn+1 be n+2 elements of\nConv(Rn ) such that y1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 yn+1 6= \u2205. Then Dnop (x, y1 , . . . , yn+1 ) holds.\nProof. Given\np\u2208\n\nV\n\ni\n\n(x \u2228\n\nV\n\nj6=i\n\nyj )\n\n(9)\n\nwe need to show that\n\nV\n(10)\np \u2208 x \u2228 ( i yi ).\nLet w be the set determined\nby x and p as in Lemma 9. Since byV(9), p lies in\nV\neach of the sets x\u2228 j6=i yj , our choice of w shows that for each i, ( j6=i yj )\u2227w is\nnonempty. These conditions together with the nonemptiness of y1 \u2227* * *\u2227yn+1 allow\nus to apply\nHelly's Theorem to the n+2 convex sets y1 , . . . , yn+1 , w, and conclude\nV\n\u0003\nthat ( i yi ) \u2227 w is nonempty, which by choice of w is equivalent to (10).\nV\nNow for each positive integer n, let (((Dnop ) \u2227 z \u2032 ) \u2228 z) \u2227 ( i yi ) denote the\n\u2032\nrelation in variables\nV x, y1 , . . . , yn+1 , z, z obtained by applying the operation\n\u2032\n(((\u2212) \u2227 z ) \u2228 z) \u2227 ( i yi ) to both sides of (8). Then we have\nn\nTheorem 11 (cf.

The positive assertions follow from Lemma 10. (Again, the reasoning that\nobtains the first identity from that lemma can be considered, formally, an application of the contrapositive of an easy direction in of one of our lemmas, in this case\nthe implication (ii)(a) =\u21d2 (iii)(b) of Lemma 6.)\nTo get a counterexample to Dnop in Conv(Rn ), take for x an n-simplex in Rn ,\nlet p be a point outside x, let x\u2032 be the central reflection of x through p, and\n\n\f12\n\nGEORGE M. BERGMAN\n\nV\nlet y1 , . . . , yn+1 be the (n\u22121)-faces of x\u2032 . Then i Vyi is empty, so the left-hand\nside of (8) is just x, while each of the intersections j6=i yj is a nonempty subset\nof x\u2032 , so the right-hand side of (8) contains p.\nAs in the proof of Theorem 8, we begin the counterexample to our more elaborate\nidentity in Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} by taking a copy of our preceding example, for the next\nlower dimension, in a hyperplane P \u2286 Rn not containing 0. Let us write p0 and\nx0 , x\u20320 , y10 , . . . , yn0 for the point and family of convex subsets of P so obtained.\nLet us also write q0 for the vertex of x\u20320 opposite to the face y10 .\nTo beef these sets up to the desired members of Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} , we now take\nx = c.h.(x0 \u222a {0}),\n\nyi = c.h.(yi0 \u222a {0}) for i 6= 1,\n\ny1 = c.h.(y10 \u222a {0, q0 /2}).\n\nFor the same reason as in the proof of Theorem 8, the operation of intersecting\nop\nwith P commutes with lattice operations on these convex sets; hence when Dn\u22121\nis evaluated at the above arguments, the left-hand side meets the plane P only in\nthe set\nV x0 , while the right-hand side will also contain the point p0 . Now observe\nthat i yi will be the line-segment c.h.(0, q0 /2). Letting p = p0 , q = q0 /2, we\nsee that these lie on different lines through 0, and deduce from the implication\n(ii)(b) =\u21d2 (ii)(a) of Lemma 6 that z and z \u2032 can be chosen so that the required\ninequality holds.\n\u0003\n6. Encore!\nCarath\u00e9odory's and Helly's Theorems are two members of a well-known triad of\nresults on convex sets in Rn . The third is\nRadon's Theorem ([6], p.391). Let n \u2265 0. Given a natural number n, and n+2\npoints p1 , . . . , pn+2 in Rn , there exists a partition of {1, . . . , n+2} into subsets I1\nand I2 such that c.h.({pi | i \u2208 I1 }) \u2229 c.h.({pi | i \u2208 I2 }) 6= \u2205.\n\u0003\nCan we turn this, too, into an identity for lattices of convex sets?\nYes. First let's get rid of reference to points: Clearly an equivalent statement\nis \"Given nonempty convex sets y1 , . . . , yn+2 inWRn , there Wexists a partition of\n{1, . . . , n+2} into subsets I1 and I2 such that ( i\u2208I1 yi ) \u2227 ( i\u2208I2 yi ) 6= \u2205.\" Next,\nthe conclusion\na partition exists can be condensed into the single inequalW that such W\nW\nity I1 ,I2 (( i\u2208I1 yi ) \u2227 ( i\u2208I2 yi )) 6= \u2205, where the outer join is over the 2n+2 \u2212 2\npartitions of {1, . . . , n+2} into two nonempty subsets. In the proof of the theorem\nbelow, Lemma 9 will be used to turn the above implication between nonemptiness\nstatements into a lattice relation.\nIn that theorem, I call an inequality a \u2264 b that always holds an \"identity\", since\nit can be rewritten as an equation a = a \u2227 b.\nTheorem 12.

We shall first prove (11) in the simpler case of Conv(Rn ), then show how\nto adapt the proof to Conv(Rn+1 )\u2265{0} , and finally, give the counterexample in\nConv(Rn+1 ).\nGiven x, y1 , . . . , yn+2 \u2208 Conv(Rn ) and a point p belonging to the left-hand\nside of (11), we must show that p also belongs to the right-hand side. Let us\nchoose w as in Lemma 9 for the given x and p. The assumption that p belongs\nto the left-hand side of (11) says that it belongs to each of the meetands of that\nexpression, which by choice of w means that w \u2227 yi is nonempty for all i. Hence\nRadon's Theorem applied to W\nthose n+2 setsWsays that for some I1 , I2 partitioning\n{1, . . . , n+2},\nwe\nhave\n\u2205\n6\n=\n(\nI1 w \u2227 yi ) \u2227 ( I2 w \u2227 yi ). The latter set is contained\nW\nW\nin w \u2227 ( I1 yi ) \u2227 ( I2 yi ), and the statement that this is nonempty now translates\nW\nW\nback to say that x \u2228 (( I1 yi ) \u2227 ( I2 yi )) contains p, whence p belongs to the\nright-hand side of (11), as required.\nIf we are given x, y1 , . . . , yn+2 \u2208 Conv(Rn+1 )\u2265{0} , and a point p on the lefthand side of (11), we begin in the same way, translating the hypothesis and desired\nconclusion to the same statements about the sets w \u2227 yi (though the convex set\nw will not in general belong to Conv(Rn+1 )\u2265{0} , and so neither will these intersections). This time we apply Radon's Theorem in n+1 dimensions to the sets\nw \u2227 yi together with {0}. In the partition given by that theorem, let us assume\nwithout\nW {0} goes into the second join; thus we get a relation\nW loss of generality that\n\u2205 6= ( I1 w \u2227 yi ) \u2227 ({0} \u2228 I2 w \u2227 yi ). Here the first join is contained in w, hence\nso\nW so that set is contained in the meet of w with the larger set\nW is the whole set,\n( I1 yi ) \u2227 ({0}\u2228 I2 yi ). Since all the y 's belong to Conv(Rn+1 )\u2265{0} , the joinands\nW\nW\n{0} are now redundant, so we have again shown that w \u2227 ( I1 yi ) \u2227 ( I2 yi ) is\nnonempty for some partition {1, . . . , n+2} = I1 \u2228 I2 , which, as before, yields the\ndesired conclusion by choice of w.\nTo show that (11) does not hold in Conv(Rn+1 ), we begin essentially as in the\nfirst counterexample in the proof of Theorem 11, letting x be an (n+1)-simplex in\nRn+1 , p a point outside that simplex, and x\u2032 the central reflection of x through p.\nThis time, however, we let y1 , . . . , yn+2 be singletons, whose unique elements are\nthe vertices of x\u2032 . As in the earlier example we find that one side of the identity\nin question (in this case the left-hand side of (11)) contains p, while the other\nis simply x, since all joinands in the \"big join\" on that side are empty; so the\nright-hand side does not majorize the left-hand side.\n\u0003\nI have not tried to fill in this picture, as I did with the Dn and Dnop , by looking\nfor related identities that would distinguish all terms of (4); but I expect that these\nexist.\nAnother observation, relevant to the whole development up to this point, which\nI have not followed up on because it occurred to me late in the preparation of this\npaper, is that if one defines Conv(Rn , cone) \u2286 Conv(Rn )\u22650 to be the sublattice\n\n\f14\n\nGEORGE M. BERGMAN\n\nconsisting of those elements which are unions of rays through 0, then Conv(Rn\u22121 )\nembeds naturally in Conv(Rn , cone), yielding an extension of the chain of varieties\nof Lemma 1. It would be interesting to know whether for n > 1 the varieties so\ninterpolated are distinct from those that precede and follow them.\n7. The sublattice of compact convex sets.\nFrom Carath\u00e9odory's Theorem, we see that\nFor any compact subset S \u2286 Rn , c.h.(S) is also compact.\n\n(12)\n\nHence the join in Conv(Rn ) of two compact subsets is compact, hence the set of\ncompact convex subsets of Rn (often called \"convex bodies\" in the literature, e.g.,\n[9], [1, \u00a73.1], [19, \u00a712]) is a sublattice Conv(Rn , cpct) \u2286 Conv(Rn ). An obvious\nquestion is how the identities of this sublattice compare with those of Conv(Rn );\ni.e., whether it satisfies any identities that the larger lattice does not. Huhn [11,\nproof of Lemma 3.1] answered this question in the negative, by showing that the\nstill smaller lattice of polytopes (convex hulls of finite sets) does not. Let me give a\nslightly different proof of the same result. Huhn used the fact that an intersection\nof polytopes is a polytope, but the next result is applicable to a finitary closure\noperator that need not have the property that an intersection of closures of finite sets\nis again one. (The meaning of \"finitary\" was recalled in the paragraph preceding\nLemma 4; the notation V( ... ) used below was defined in \u00a71.)\nProposition 13. Let cl be a finitary closure operator on a set X, and let L be\nthe lattice of subsets of X closed under cl. Then every lattice relation satisfied by\nall families of elements of L that are closures of finite subsets of X is an identity\nof L. In particular, if L\u2032 is any sublattice of L which contains all closures of finite\nsubsets of X, then V(L\u2032 ) = V(L).\nProof. Let us topologize the power set 2X by taking as a basis of open sets the\nsets\nU (A, B) = {Y \u2208 2X | A \u2286 Y \u2286 B},\nwhere A ranges over the finite subsets of X, and B over arbitrary subsets. This\nis stronger than the usual power-set topology, which only uses the sets of the above\nform with B cofinite. Thus, our topology is Hausdorff, though not in general\ncompact; hence its restriction to L is also Hausdorff, with basis of open sets given\nby the sets UL (A, B) = U (A, B) \u2229 L. (Of course, UL (A, B) is nonempty only when\ncl(A) \u2286 B.)\nWe claim that under this topology, the lattice operations of L are continuous,\nand the closures of finite subsets of X are dense in L. This will imply that any\nlattice identity holding on that dense subset must hold on all of L, from which the\nfinal conclusion will clearly follow.\nTo see that closures of finite sets are dense, note that every nonempty basic set\nUL (A, B) contains the element cl(A), which is such a set.\nThe continuity of the meet operation is also straightforward: If x, y \u2208 L are such\nthat x \u2227 y, i.e., x \u2229 y, lies in UL (A, B), then UL (A, x \u222a B) and UL (A, y \u222a B) are\n\n\fON LATTICES OF CONVEX SETS IN Rn\n\n15\n\nneighborhoods of x and y respectively such that the intersection of any member\nof the first neighborhood and any member of the second lies in UL (A, B).\nFinally, suppose x, y \u2208 L are such that x \u2228 y, i.e., cl(x \u222a y), lies in UL (A, B).\nThen the finite set A is contained in cl(x \u222a y), so by finitariness of cl, there is a\nfinite subset of x \u222a y whose closure contains all elements of A; let us write this\nsubset as Ax \u222a Ay , where Ax \u2286 x and Ay \u2286 y. Then UL (Ax , x) and UL (Ay , y)\nwill be neighborhoods of x and y respectively such that the join of any member\nof the first neighborhood and any member of the second is a member of UL (A, B).\n(In the power-set topology, \u2228 is generally discontinuous; this is why we needed a\ndifferent topology.)\n\u0003\nFor X = Rn and cl = c.h., the L of the above proposition is Conv(Rn ).\nSince the convex hull of a finite set is compact, we can apply the last sentence of\nthe proposition with L\u2032 = Conv(Rn , cpct), getting the first statement of the next\ntheorem. Taking cl = c.h.({0} \u222a \u2212) we similarly get the second.\nTheorem 14 (Huhn). For every natural number n, V(Conv(Rn )) = V(Conv(Rn , cpct)),\nand V(Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} ) = V(Conv(Rn , cpct)\u2265{0} ).\n\u0003\nHowever, Conv(Rn , cpct) is known also to have interesting elementary properties not possessed by Conv(Rn ). Let us recall that an extremal point of a convex\nset means a point which is not in the convex hull of any two other points of the set,\nand the following result ([9, p.276]).\nTheorem (Minkowski). Every compact convex subset of Rn is the convex hull of\nits set of extremal points.\n\u0003\nRecall also that a lattice L is called join semidistributive if for all x, y1 , y2 \u2208 L\none has\nx \u2228 y1 = x \u2228 y2 =\u21d2 x \u2228 y1 = x \u2228 (y1 \u2227 y2 ).\n(13)\nLemma 15 ( = [1, Theorem 3.4], generalizing [5, Theorem 15]). For every positive\ninteger n, Conv(Rn , cpct) is join semidistributive.\nProof. Every extremal point of a join x \u2228 y must belong to x or to y, since by\ndefinition it cannot arise as a convex combination of other points of x \u2228 y, hence if\nx \u2228 y1 = x \u2228 y2 as in the hypothesis of (13), extremal points of this set that do not\nbelong to x must belong to y1 , and likewise to y2 . Thus every extremal point of\nx \u2228 y1 = x \u2228 y2 belongs to x \u222a (y1 \u2229 y2 ); hence by Minkowski's Theorem the convex\nhull of the latter set, x \u2228 (y1 \u2227 y2 ), contains the former set. The reverse inclusion\nis trivial.\n\u0003\nOn the other hand, for n \u2265 2, Conv(Rn ) is not join semidistributive; indeed, the\nnext result will show the failure of successively weaker properties, beginning with\njoin-semidistributity, as n increases. Following Geyer [8], let us say that a lattice\nL is n-join semidistributive for a positive integer n if for all x, y1 , . . . , yn+1 \u2208 L\none has\nW\n(14)\nx \u2228 y1 = * * * = x \u2228 yn+1 =\u21d2 x \u2228 y1 = x \u2228 ( i,j; i 6= j yi \u2227 yj ).\n\n\f16\n\nGEORGE M. BERGMAN\n\nThus, join semidistributivity is the n = 1 case. One defines n-meet semidistributivity dually.\nThe (n+4)-element lattice of height 2, Mn+2 , with least element 0, greatest\nelement 1, and n+2 incomparable elements y1 , . . . , yn+2 , is neither n-join semidistributive nor n-meet semidistributive, as may be seen by putting yn+2 in the role\nof x in (14), and in the dual statement. We shall now see that there are several\nsorts of sublattices with that structure within the lattices Conv(Rn ). The \"open\nbounded\" case of the next result was shown to me by D. Wasserman.\nLemma 16 (Wasserman and Bergman). For every n > 1, Conv(Rn ) contains\ncopies of Mn+1 consisting of open bounded sets and copies consisting of closed unbounded sets, in both cases with least element \u2205; and Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} contains copies\nof Mn+1 consisting of bounded sets, with least element {0}. Also, Conv(R2 )\u2265{0}\n \u030a\n(and hence Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} for all n > 1) contains copies of Mc , the height- 2 lattice of continuum cardinality  \u030a\n(and hence contains copies of its sublattices Mm for\nall natural numbers m) consisting of vector subspaces, with least element {0}.\nIn particular, for n > 1 neither Conv(Rn ) nor Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} is N -join or\nN -meet semidistributive for any N, and the sublattices of open bounded sets in\nConv(Rn ) and of bounded sets in Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} are not (n\u22121)-join or (n\u22121)meet semidistributive.\nProof. To get a copy of Mn+1 consisting of open bounded sets, start with any\nn-simplex x, let its faces be x1 , . . . , xn+1 , choose an interior point p of x, and for\neach i let yi be the interior of the n-simplex {p} \u2228 xi (or any open convex subset\nof that n-simplex which has the whole face xi in its closure). We see that the join\nof any two of the y 's will have in its closure two faces of x, hence all vertices of\nx, hence its closure must be x, hence being itself open and convex, it must be the\ninterior of x. On the other hand, the pairwise intersections of the yi are all empty.\nHence the lattice generated by these sets is isomorphic to Mn+1 .\nFor the closed unbounded example with least element again \u2205, extend each of\nthe sets in the preceding example to an infinite cone with apex p, displace each\nof these cones away from p (say by translating it by the vector from the opposite\nvertex of x to p), and take their closures. Then every pairwise join is seen to be\nthe whole of Rn , while every pairwise meet is again empty.\nFor the bounded example in Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} , take the first example above, assuming p = 0, and use as our new yi the union of the yi of that example with\n{0}. (Thus, 0 will be the unique boundary-point belonging to each of these sets.)\nFinally, an Mc in Conv(R2 )\u2265{0} is given by the set of all lines through 0. \u0003\nThere are also cases where we can show the failure of m-join semidistributivity in\na natural lattice of convex sets, but where that lattice probably does not contain a\ncopy of Mm+2 . To get such an example in the lattice of convex open subsets of R2\ncontaining 0, for any m > 1, take m+2 distinct lines through 0 and \"thicken\"\nthese to open sets x, y1 , . . . , ym+1 of width 1. The lattice that these generate\nwill not be Mm+2 , but clearly fails to satisfy (14). We can get such examples for\nbounded open sets in R2 , though in this case they fail to have a common point: Fix\n\n\fON LATTICES OF CONVEX SETS IN Rn\n\n17\n\na triangle T, and let x be the interior of any triangle lying inside T and sharing\none edge with T, but not the opposite vertex p. Then take m+1 \"small narrow\"\ntriangles inside T that have p as a common vertex but no other point in common,\nand the convex hull of whose union is disjoint from x, and let y1 , . . . , ym+1 be\ntheir interiors.\nThe parenthetical comment in the first sentence of the proof of the Lemma 16\nshows that the shapes of the convex sets forming a copy of Mn+1 in the lattice\nof open bounded convex sets are not unique; but I don't know an example where\nthe top element of such a sublattice is not an open n-simplex. It would also be of\ninterest to know whether this lattice contains copies of Mn+2 , and if not, whether\nit is n-join or n-meet semidistributive. We shall obtain a few related results in\nsubsequent sections.\nJ\u00f3nsson and Rival [13, Lemma 2.1] show that a lattice is join and meet semidistributive if and only if two auxiliary overlattices contain no isomorphic copies of\nany member of a certain list of 6 lattices, beginning with M3 . The above \"small\nnarrow triangle\" construction gives, when m = 2, a copy of the lattice L4 of their\nlist.\nIncidentally, Geyer's concept of n-join semidistributivity, which we have been using, does not have any obvious relationship with Huhn's n-distributivity. Although\nfor n = 1 they give the conditions of join-semidistributivity and distributivity respectively, of which the latter implies the former, no such implication holds for\nlarger n. For instance, the lattice Mc is 2-distributive in Huhn's sense, but it is\nnot N -join semidistributive for any natural number N in Geyer's sense.\n8. Open bounded sets do not satisfy additional identities.\nLet us denote by Conv(Rn , o.bdd.) the lattice of open bounded convex subsets\nof Rn . We shall show that this lattice, like Conv(Rn , cpct), satisfies the same\nidentities as Conv(Rn ). The idea is that compact sets can be approximated by\nopen bounded sets containing them, from which we shall deduce that any identities\nof Conv(Rn , o.bdd.) are also identities of Conv(Rn , cpct), and so by Theorem 14\nare identities of Conv(Rn ).\nn\nTo approximate compact sets by open sets, we need a different topology on 2R\nfrom the one used earlier; let us again describe this in a general context. If X is\nany topological space, we may topologize 2X using a basis of open sets with the\nsame form as before,\nU (A, B) = {Y \u2208 2X | A \u2286 Y \u2286 B},\n\n(15)\n\nbut where, this time, A ranges over all subsets of X, while B is restricted to open\nsubsets. If X is Hausdorff (or even T1), we see that this family of open sets again\nincludes those defining the power-set topology, so our topology is again Hausdorff.\nNote that for each A \u2208 2X , the sets (15) with A as first argument and with second\nargument containing A form a neighborhood basis of A in 2X . Thus in proving\nthe next lemma, we shall take it as understood that to be \"sufficiently close to\" a\n\n\f18\n\nGEORGE M. BERGMAN\n\nset A means to contain A and be contained in some specified open neighborhood\nB of A in X.\nIn the formulation of that lemma, note that the statement that a function is\ncontinuous at arguments with a given property does not simply mean that the\nrestriction of the function to the set of such arguments is continuous, but, more,\nthat such arguments are points of continuity of the whole function.\nLemma 17. If X is any topological space, then the binary operation \u222a : 2X \u00d72X \u2192\n2X is continuous in the topology described above; if X is normal  \u030a\n(i.e., if disjoint\nclosed subsets of X have disjoint open neighborhoods \u030a\n) then the binary operation \u2229\nis continuous at arguments given by pairs of closed sets, and if X = Rn with the\nusual topology, then the unary convex-hull operation c.h. : 2X \u2192 2X is continuous\nat compact sets.\nProof. To show continuity of \u222a, consider sets A1 , A2 , and an open neighborhood\nB of A1 \u222a A2 in X. Then we see that the union of any member of U (A1 , B) and\nany member of U (A2 , B) contains A1 \u222a A2 and is contained in B, as required.\nFor the case of \u2229, let A1 and A2 be closed sets, and B any open neighborhood\nof A1 \u2229 A2 in X. Then A1 \u2212 B and A2 \u2212 B are disjoint closed sets, hence they\nhave disjoint open neighborhoods C1 and C2 . We see that B \u222aC1 and B \u222aC2 will\nbe open neighborhoods of A1 and A2 which intersect in B (by distributivity of\nthe lattice 2X ), and it follows that the intersection of a member of U (A1 , B \u222a C1 )\nand a member of U (A2 , B \u222a C2 ) will belong to U (A1 \u2229 A2 , B), as required.\nFor the final assertion, let A be a compact subset of Rn , and B any open\nneighborhood of c.h.(A). By compactness of c.h.(A), there is some \u01eb > 0 such\nthat the set C of all points having distance < \u01eb from c.h.(A) is contained in B.\nThis set C is a convex open neighborhood of c.h.(A), hence c.h. carries U (A, C)\ninto U (c.h.(A), C) \u2286 U (c.h.(A), B), as required.\n\u0003\n(I played with several topologies before getting the one that made the above\nresult \u2013 in particular, continuity of intersection \u2013 easy to prove. Some of these\nmight be preferable for other considerations of the same sort. Under the above\ntopology, every open set A is an isolated point, since U (A, A) is a singleton. If\none wants to approximate open sets by larger open sets, one might prefer a weaker\ntopology in which the conditions on Y in (15) are, say, strengthened to A \u2286 Y,\ncl(Y ) \u2286 B.)\nIt follows from Lemma 17 that in the topology we have defined, the lattice\noperations of Conv(Rn ) are continuous at arguments belonging to Conv(Rn , cpct).\nMoreover, Conv(Rn , cpct) lies in the closure of Conv(Rn , o.bdd.), since every\ncompact convex set A is the limit in this topology, as \u01eb \u2192 0, of the open convex\nset of points at distance < \u01eb from A. Hence any lattice identities holding in\nConv(Rn , o.bdd.) also hold in Conv(Rn , cpct). The same considerations apply\nto the pair of lattices Conv(Rn , o.bdd.)\u2265{0} and Conv(Rn , cpct)\u2265{0} . In view of\nTheorem 14, these observations give us\nTheorem 18. For every natural number n, V(Conv(Rn )) = V(Conv(Rn , o.bdd.)),\nand V(Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} ) = V(Conv(Rn , o.bdd.)\u2265{0} ).\n\u0003\n\n\fON LATTICES OF CONVEX SETS IN Rn\n\n19\n\nLet us note that there is an order-preserving bijection between the elements of\nConv(Rn , o.bdd.) and the compact convex subsets of Rn having nonempty interior,\ngiven by the operation of topological closure, with inverse given by topological\ninterior. This is not, however, an isomorphism between sublattices of Conv(Rn ),\nbecause the class of compact convex sets with nonempty interior is not closed under\nintersection. (E.g., consider two adjacent closed polygons in R2 . Nor can we get\naround this problem by going to a homomorphic image of Conv(Rn , cpct) where\nsets without interior are identified with \u2205, since the join of two such sets can have\nnonempty interior.)\nOn the other hand, the set of compact convex sets which are neighborhoods\nof 0 is a sublattice of Conv(Rn , cpct)\u2265{0} , and the above correspondence gives\nus an isomorphism between it and Conv(Rn , o.bdd.)\u2265{0} ; so we can apply results\nabout Conv(Rn , cpct)\u2265{0} to Conv(Rn , o.bdd.)\u2265{0} . (More generally, any sublattice of Conv(Rn , o.bdd.) whose members have a common point p is contained in\nConv(Rn , o.bdd.)\u2265{p} \u223c\n= Conv(Rn , o.bdd.)\u2265{0} , and so can be studied in the same\nfashion.) Thus, despite the examples of Lemma 16, we have\nCorollary 19 (to Lemma 15). Conv(Rn , o.bdd.)\u2265{0} is join semidistributive.\nHence, every counterexample to join semidistributivity in Conv(Rn , o.bdd.) has\nthe property that the intersection of the three sets involved is empty.\n\u0003\nSince we are considering elementary properties in which Conv(Rn ) and Conv(Rn , o.bdd.)\nagree or differ, we should note the obvious difference, that the former is atomistic\n(every element is a possibly infinite join of atoms), while the latter has no atoms.\nCf. [2] and papers referred to there, in which lattices of convex sets and related\nstructures are characterized in terms of properties of their atoms, and also [1].\nWe noted earlier that lattices Conv(Rn )\u2265S for nonempty S satisfy all identities\nholding in Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} . Let us end this section by using Theorem 18 to show\nthat for bounded S, the converse is also true.\nCorollary 20 (to Theorem 18 and proof of Theorem 14). For every natural number\nn and every bounded set S \u2286 Rn ,\nV(Conv(Rn )\u2265S ) = V(Conv(Rn , cpct)\u2265S )\n= V(Conv(Rn , o.bdd.)\u2265S ) = V(Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} ).\nProof. By a translation, we can assume without loss of generality that 0 \u2208 S; thus\nthe last of the above lattices contains all the others, so letting f (x1 , . . . , xm ) =\ng(x1 , . . . , xm ) be any identity not satisfied there, it suffices to prove that it is not\nsatisfied in any of the other lattices.\nNow Theorem 18 shows that f = g is not an identity of Conv(Rn , o.bdd.)\u2265{0} ,\nhence we can choose open bounded convex sets x1 , . . . , xm containing 0 which do\nnot satisfy it. The intersection of these sets is a neighborhood of the origin, and\ndilating the xi by a large enough real constant, we can assume without loss of\ngenerality that this neighborhood contains S. Hence f = g is also not an identity\nof Conv(Rn , o.bdd.)\u2265S , hence not an identity of Conv(Rn )\u2265S either.\nThe case of Conv(Rn , cpct)\u2265S is similar. Again take x1 , . . . , xm \u2208 Conv(Rn , o.bdd.)\u2265{0}\nnot satisfying f = g. We saw in the proof of Theorem 14 that if we approximate\n\n\f20\n\nGEORGE M. BERGMAN\n\nx1 , . . . , xm closely enough from below in the topology of that proof by compact convex subsets y1 , . . . , ym , these approximating sets also fail to satisfy that identity.\nSince the intersection of the xi is a neighborhood of 0, it contains an n-simplex\nwith 0 in its interior; so we can take all the yi to contain the finitely many vertices of that simplex, hence to be neighborhoods of 0. As before, we may now dilate\nthem so that they all contain S, getting the required result.\n\u0003\n9. The possibility of surface phenomena.\nThe technique by which we just proved Corollary 20 can be inverted to show\nthat if T \u2286 Rn is any convex set with nonempty interior, then the lattice of convex\nsets contained in T, and its sublattices of compact convex subsets of T and open\nbounded convex subsets of T, satisfy the same identities as Conv(Rn ). Namely,\ngiven any identity not holding in Conv(Rn ), we already know that we can find\nelements x1 , . . . , xm not satisfying it in Conv(Rn , cpct). Assuming without loss of\ngenerality that 0 lies in the interior of T, we can shrink x1 , . . . , xm by a constant,\nso that they lie in T as well. A similar argument shows that the lattice of convex\nsubsets of T which contain a specified point of the interior of T satisfies the same\nidentities as Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} .\nHowever, if we specify two convex sets S \u2286 T, say with S compact and T\nopen, and look at the interval [S, T ] = {x \u2208 Conv(Rn ) | S \u2286 x \u2286 T }, it is not\nclear whether, for some choices of S and T, this may satisfy more identities than\nhold in Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} . (Picturing S and T as \"very close\", e.g., the closed ball\nof radius 1 and the open ball of radius 1 + \u01eb, explains, I hope, the title of this\nsection.)\nLet us relax our assumptions on S and T for a moment and look at a more\nextreme example. If we take for S the open unit ball and for T the closed unit\nball in Rn , then every set x with S \u2286 x \u2286 T is convex, so in this case [S, T ] may\nbe identified with the lattice of all subsets of the unit sphere, which is distributive,\nthough we have seen that Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} is not even (n\u22121)-distributive.\nIn the case where S is compact and T open, however, things cannot go that\nfar:\nLemma 21. Let S \u2286 T be convex subsets of Rn . If S is compact and T is open\nand nonempty, or more generally, if some hyperplane P \u2286 Rn disjoint from S\nintersects T in a set with nonempty relative interior  \u030a\n(i.e., is such that P \u2229 T is\nn\u22121\n \u030a\n(n\u22121)-dimensional ), then V([S, T ]) \u2287 V(Conv(R\n)).\nProof. Clearly, a pair S \u2286 T satisfying the first hypothesis satisfies the second,\nso let us assume the latter. Let H be the closed half-space of Rn bounded by P\nthat contains S (or if S is empty, either of the closed half-spaces bounded by P ),\nand consider the sublattice [S, H \u2229 T ] \u2286 [S, T ]. The operation of intersecting with\nP can be seen to give a lattice homomorphism [S, H \u2229 T ] \u2192 [\u2205, P \u2229 T ], and this\nis surjective, since it has the set-theoretic section x 7\u2192 S \u2228 x. Since P \u2229 T has\nnonempty interior in P, the observation in the first paragraph of this section shows\nthat [\u2205, P \u2229 T ] satisfies precisely the identities of Conv(Rn\u22121 ). Hence [S, H \u2229 T ],\n\n\fON LATTICES OF CONVEX SETS IN Rn\n\n21\n\nsince it maps homomorphically onto [\u2205, P \u2229 T ], cannot satisfy any identities not\nsatisfied by Conv(Rn\u22121 ), so neither can the larger lattice [S, T ].\n\u0003\nIt is not evident whether, for S compact and T open, V([S, T ]) can ever\nbe strictly smaller than V(Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} ); nor, for that matter, whether it can\never fail to be strictly smaller, if S has nonempty interior and T is bounded.\nAnother interval [S, T ] \u2286 Conv(Rn ) whose identities it would be interesting to\ninvestigate is given by letting S = {0} and T be a closed half-space with 0 on its\nboundary. Again these identities must lie somewhere between those of Conv(Rn\u22121 )\nand Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} .\nIn this and preceding sections we have used from time to time the fact that\ntranslations and dilations preserve convexity. More generally, if \u03c6 is any projective\ntransformation on n-dimensional projective space Pn \u2287 Rn , then convex subsets\nof Rn which do not meet the hyperplane that \u03c6 sends to infinity are taken by\n\u03c6 to convex sets. Hence if S \u2286 T are such convex sets, \u03c6 induces a lattice\nisomorphism [S, T ] \u223c\n= [\u03c6(S), \u03c6(T )]. This observation might be useful in classifying\nvarieties generated by such intervals.\nAnother sort of sublattice of Conv(Rn ) that it might be interesting to investigate\nis that of all convex sets that are carried into themselves by a given affine map;\ne.g., the orthogonal projection onto a specified subspace. (If that subspace is {0},\nwe get Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} with one additional element \u2205 thrown in.)\n10. Dualities.\nLet us recall the definition of a concept we have referred to a couple of times in\npassing. A closed half-space in Rn means a set of the form\n{p \u2208 Rn | f (p) \u2264 \u03bb},\n\n(16)\n\nn\n\nfor some nonzero linear functional f on R and some real number \u03bb. It is a\nstandard result that every closed convex subset of Rn is an intersection of closed\nhalf-spaces.\nThe half-space (16) contains the point 0 if and only if \u03bb is nonnegative, hence\nclosed convex sets containing 0 can be characterized as intersections of half-spaces\n(16) having \u03bb \u2265 0. Such sets can, in fact, be expressed as intersections of such\nhalf-spaces with \u03bb > 0, since a half-space (16) with \u03bb = 0 is the intersection of\nall the half-spaces with the same f and positive \u03bb. But a half-space (16) with\n\u03bb positive can be written as {p \u2208 Rn | \u03bb\u22121 f (p) \u2264 1}, or, expressing the linear\nfunctional \u03bb\u22121 f as the dot product with some q \u2208 Rn , as\n{p \u2208 Rn | q *p \u2264 1}.\n\n(17)\n\nThus, for any subset S \u2286 Rn , if we define\nS \u2217 = {q \u2208 Rn | (\u2200p \u2208 S) q *p \u2264 1},\n\u2217\u2217\n\n(18)\n\nthen S will be the least closed convex set containing S \u222a {0}. Moreover, we see\nthat S \u2217 will also be a closed convex subset containing 0, which uniquely determines\nand is determined by S \u2217\u2217 . Thus, the operator \u2217 gives a bijection of the family of\n\n\f22\n\nGEORGE M. BERGMAN\n\nall closed convex sets containing 0 with itself, which is easily seen to be inclusionreversing. (This is an example of a Galois connection; cf. [3, \u00a75.5] for a general\ndevelopment of the concept, with many examples.) Let us call two closed convex\nsets containing 0 that are related in this way dual to one another. (The dual of\na convex set is sometimes called its polar set, e.g., in [15].) Examples in R3 are a\ncube and an octahedron of appropriate radii centered at the origin, and similarly a\ndodecahedron and an icosahedron. The unit sphere is self-dual.\nThe class of closed convex subspaces of Rn forms a lattice (by general properties\nof Galois connections), which, like Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} , has intersection as its meet\noperation; but the join operations do not everywhere coincide \u2013 a consequence of\nthe fact that, given closed sets u, v \u2208 Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} , their join in that lattice,\nc.h.(u \u222a v), may not be closed, so that to get their join as closed convex sets, one\nmust take its topological closure. For example, let n = 2, and let u be the closed\nstrip {(x, y) | \u22121 \u2264 y \u2264 1} and v the line segment c.h.(0, (0, 2)). Then the join of\nu and v in Conv(Rn )\u22650 is\n{(x, y) | \u22121 \u2264 y < 2} \u222a {(0, 2)},\nwhile their join in the corresponding lattice of closed convex sets is {(x, y) |\n\u22121 \u2264 y \u2264 2}. In view of this difference in operations, care is needed when using our\nduality on closed convex sets to deduce results about the lattice Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} .\nIf x and y are mutually dual closed convex sets containing 0 in Rn , it is not\nhard to see that one of them is bounded (i.e., compact) if and only if 0 is an interior\npoint of the other. It follows that the class of closed bounded convex sets having 0\nin their interior is self-dual; moreover, we saw at the beginning of \u00a77 that the join in\nConv(Rn ) of two compact sets is again compact, from which it follows that unlike\nthe lattice of all closed convex sets containing 0, this is a sublattice of Conv(Rn ).\nIt is easy to see from the equality of the second and fourth varieties in Corollary 20\nthat this sublattice satisfies the same identities as Conv(Rn ). Hence the existence\nof the anti-automorphism just noted gives us\nTheorem 22. The class of lattice identities satisfied by Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} is self-dual,\ni.e., closed under interchanging all instances of \u2228 and \u2227. Equivalently, the variety\nV(Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} ) is closed under taking dual lattices.\n\u0003\nAnd indeed, the identities proved for Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} in Theorems 8 and 11 respectively are dual to one another. This is not true of the identities proved for\nConv(Rn ) in those theorems, as is easily verified:\nExercise 23. (i) For every positive integer n, show by example that Conv(Rn )\ndoes not satisfy either of the identities\nW\n((Dnop ) \u2227 z) \u2228 y1 \u2228 y2 and (((Dn ) \u2228 z \u2032 ) \u2227 z) \u2228 ( i yi ),\ndual to the identities proved for that lattice in Theorems 8 and 11 respectively.\n(ii) Show that these observations together with Theorem 22 yield an alternative way of verifying that in each of Theorems 8 and 11, the identities proved for\nConv(Rn ) are not satisfied by Conv(Rn+1 )\u2265{0} .\n\n\fON LATTICES OF CONVEX SETS IN Rn\n\n23\n\nTheorem 22 also implies that Conv(Rn+1 )\u2265{0} , and hence also Conv(Rn ), satisfies the dual of the identity of Theorem 12, which we had not previously obtained.\nJust as every closed convex set is an intersection of closed half-spaces (16), so\nevery open convex set is an intersection of open half-spaces,\n{p \u2208 Rn | f (p) < \u03bb}.\nBut here the converse is not true. Indeed, every closed half-space is also an intersection of open half-spaces, so the class of intersections of open half-spaces includes\nboth the open and the closed convex sets. If for every subset S \u2286 Rn one defines\nS \u22c4 = {q \u2208 Rn | (\u2200p \u2208 S) q *p < 1},\n\n(19)\n\n\u22c4\u22c4\n\none gets a duality theory for the class of\n-invariant sets, i.e., sets satisfying\nx\u22c4\u22c4 = x, a larger class than that covered by the preceding duality. It is not hard\nto see that a necessary and sufficient condition for a set x \u2208 Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} to\nbe \u22c4\u22c4 -invariant is that for every point p of the boundary of x which does not\nbelong to x, there exist a supporting hyperplane of x through p containing no\npoint of x. From this we can see that the union of the open unit ball B in Rn\nwith any subset of its boundary is \u22c4\u22c4 -invariant; its \u22c4 -dual is the union of B with\nthe complementary subset of the boundary. On the other hand, we find that the\nunion of an open polygonal neighborhood P of 0 in the plane with a nonempty\nfinite (or countable) subset S of its boundary is never \u22c4\u22c4 -invariant, since by the\nabove characterization of \u22c4\u22c4 -invariant sets, each point q \u2208 S forces the \u22c4\u22c4 -closure\nof P \u222a S to contain all points p of the open edge(s) of our polygon containing or\nadjacent to q.\nLike the \u2217\u2217 -invariant sets (closed convex sets containing 0), the \u22c4\u22c4 -invariant\nsubsets of Rn form a lattice by general properties of Galois connections, which\nhas the same meet operation as Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} , but different join operation. For\ninstance, if P is, as above, an open polygonal neighborhood of 0 in R2 , q a\npoint of its boundary, and Q = c.h.(0, q), then writing \u2228 for the join operation\nof Conv(R2 )\u2265{0} , we find that P \u2228 Q = P \u222a Q = P \u222a {q}, but as we saw above,\nthis set is not \u22c4\u22c4 -invariant. Rather, (P \u222a Q)\u22c4\u22c4 , the join of P and Q in the\nlattice of \u22c4\u22c4 -invariant sets, is obtained by attaching to P \u222a {q} the open edge(s)\ncontaining or adjacent to q. Further, the \u2217\u2217 -invariant subsets of Rn do not even\nform a sublattice of the the \u22c4\u22c4 -invariant sets. To see this in R2 , let\nu = {(x, y) | |x| < 1, y \u2265 1/(1 \u2212 x2 ) \u2212 2},\nv = {(x, y) | |x| < 1, y \u2264 \u22121/(1 \u2212 x2 ) + 2}.\nWe see that the join of u and v in Conv(R2 )\u2265{0} is {(x, y) | |x| < 1}, which is\nopen, hence is \u22c4\u22c4 -invariant, hence is their join in the lattice of \u22c4\u22c4 -invariant sets;\nbut it is not closed, hence is not their join in the lattice of \u2217\u2217 -invariant sets.\nBut again, one can apply \u22c4\u22c4 -duality to sublattices of Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} which consist of \u22c4\u22c4 -invariant elements, since for these the two lattice structures in question\nmust agree. In particular, one can verify that \u22c4 -duality interchanges compact and\nopen sets, giving an anti-isomorphism between the sublattices Conv(Rn , cpct)\u2265{0}\n\n\f24\n\nGEORGE M. BERGMAN\n\nand Conv(Rn , open)\u2265{0} . (This anti-isomorphism can also be obtained by composing the anti-isomorphism \" \u2217 \" between Conv(Rn , cpct)\u2265{0} and the lattice of\nclosed convex sets that are neighborhoods of the origin, with the isomorphism noted\nearlier between that lattice and Conv(Rn , open)\u2265{0} .) The existence of this antiisomorphism gives\nCorollary 24 (to Lemma 15). For every positive integer n, Conv(Rn , open)\u2265{0}\nis meet semidistributive, that is, satisfies the dual of (13).\n\u0003\nThis explains the fact that in Lemma 16 and the discussion that followed, though\nwe saw that Conv(Rn , open)\u2265{0} was not join semidistributive, we found no copies\nof M3 in it.\nMeet-semidistributivity does not hold in any of the lattices of convex sets we\nhave considered that are not defined so as to make those sets all have some point\n(such as 0) in common; for in each of these lattices, it is easy to get examples of a\nset x having empty intersection with each of two sets y1 and y2 , but nonempty\nintersection with their join. It also does not hold in Conv(Rn , cpct)\u2265{0} for n > 1,\nsince that lattice embeds in in Conv(Rn\u22121 , cpct) (cf. proof of Lemma 1), to which\nthe above observation applies.\nWhile on the topic of join- and meet-semidistributivity, I will note some questions\nand examples which are easier to state now that we have named several sublattices of\nConv(Rn ). Kira Adaricheva (personal communication) has posed several questions\nof the following form: If we take one of the sublattices of Conv(Rn ) that we know\nto be join- or meet-semidistributive, and extend it by adjoining, within Conv(Rn ),\na single \"nice\" outside element, is the property in question already lost, and if so,\ndoes the resulting lattice in fact contain copies of M3 ?\nIn many cases this does happen. For instance, the sublattice L \u2286 Conv(R2 )\ngenerated by the join-semidistributive sublattice Conv(R2 , cpct), and the open\ndisk, which we shall denote B, contains a copy of M3 . To describe it, let p0 , p1 ,\np2 be any three distinct points on the unit circle, and for i = 0, 1, 2 define the point\nqi = 1/5pi + 2/5pi+1 + 2/5pi+2 (subscripts evaluated mod 3; I suggest making a\nsketch). Let xi = (c.h.(qi , pi+1 ) \u2227 B) \u2228 (c.h.(qi , pi+2 ) \u2227 B). Then x1 , x2 , x3 can\nbe seen to generate a copy of M3 in Conv(R2 ), resembling, though not identical\nto, the n = 2 case of the first example described in Lemma 16. An analogous\nconstruction gives a family of elements of L resembling the example described\nimmediately following that lemma, showing that L is not m-join semidistributive\nfor any m.\nAs another example let L be the sublattice of Conv(R3 )\u2265{0} generated by\nConv(R3 , o.bdd.)\u2265{0} and the cube C = [\u22121, +1]3 . Letting B denote the interior of C, I claim that for any triangle T drawn on a face F of C, L contains the union of B with the interior of T relative to F. Indeed, we can find in\nConv(R3 , o.bdd.)\u2265{0} an open pyramid P (with apex near 0) meeting no face of C\nexcept F, and meeting F in precisely the relative interior of T. Then (P \u2227 C) \u2228 B\nwill be the desired set. If we construct three sets of this sort using as our T 's\nthree triangles in a common face F of C, whose relative interiors form a copy of\nthe n = 2 case of the first example of Lemma 16, then the sublattice generated by\n\n\fON LATTICES OF CONVEX SETS IN Rn\n\n25\n\nthe three resulting sets (P \u2227 C) \u2228 B will have the form M3 (with B as its least\nelement; cf. the last sentence of Corollary 19). The same trick can be used to get\nexamples like those of the paragraph following Lemma 16, showing that L is not\nm-join semidistributive for any positive m.\nOn the other hand, I do not know what can be said about the lattices gotten\nby adjoining to Conv(Rn , o.bdd.)\u2265{0} a closed ball D about 0, respectively an\nopen ball B not containing 0, except that the second of these lattices is not meetsemidistributive, since we can find three \"fingers\" in Conv(Rn , o.bdd.)\u2265{0} which\nmeet B in disjoint subsets x, y1 , y2 , such that x \u2227 (y1 \u2228 y2 ) is nonempty.\n11. Relatively convex sets.\nLet S be a subset of Rn , in general non-convex. We shall call a subset x \u2286 S\nconvex relative to S if x = c.h.(x) \u2229 S; equivalently, if x is the intersection of S\nwith some convex subset of Rn . Such sets x will form a lattice RelConv(S), with\nmeet operation given, as in (2), by intersection, but join now given by\nx \u2228 y = c.h.(x \u222a y) \u2229 S.\n\n(20)\n\nNote that the map x 7\u2192 c.h.(x) gives a bijection between the relatively convex\nsubsets of S, and the subsets of Rn which are convex hulls of subsets of S, the\ninverse map being given by \u2212 \u2229 S. Convex sets of the latter sort form a lattice with\njoin as in (2), but with meet operation\nx \u2227 y = c.h.(x \u2229 y \u2229 S).\n\n(21)\n\nWe observe that Carath\u00e9odory's Theorem (with the \"refinement\" given in the final\nsentence), regarded as a statement about the closure operator c.h.(\u2212) on Rn ,\nentails the same properties for the closure operator c.h.(\u2212) \u2229 S on S. Hence the\nproofs of Lemma 3 and of the positive assertions of Theorem 8 immediately yield\nProposition 25 (cf. Huhn [11, Lemma 3.2]). If n is a natural number and S a\nsubset of Rn , then RelConv(S) satisfies the identity ((Dn ) \u2228 z) \u2227 y1 \u2227 y2 , and if\np is a point of S, RelConv(S)\u2265{p} satisfies the identity Dn .\n\u0003\nHowever, the next lemma shows that the corresponding results fail badly for\nthe identities involving Dnop obtained in Theorem 11. In this lemma, the second\nassertion embraces the first (plus two obvious intermediate results not stated);\nhowever I include the first assertion because both its statement and the example\nproving it are more transparent than for the second.\nLemma 26. For S a subset of R2 , RelConv(S) need not satisfy the identity Dnop\nfor any positive integer n. In fact, for p an element\nV of such an S, RelConv(S)\u2265{p}\nneed not satisfy the identity (((Dnop ) \u2227 z \u2032 ) \u2228 z) \u2227 ( i yi ).\nProof. To get the first assertion, let S be the set consisting of the unit circle and\nits center, 0. Given n, let q1 , . . . , q2n+2 be the successive vertices of a regular\n(2n+2)-gon on that circle; for i = 1, . . . , n+1, let yi = {q1 , . . . , qn+1 } \u2212 {qi }, and\nlet x = {qn+2 , . . . , q2n+2 }. Observe that each intersection of n of the y 's consists\n\n\f26\n\nGEORGE M. BERGMAN\n\nof one of the points qi , and that x contains the antipodal point; hence the join of\nx with each intersection of n y 's contains 0. On the other hand, the intersection\nof all the y 's is empty, hence its join with x is x, which does not contain 0. So\nDnop fails for this choice of arguments.\nTo get an example where all the given sets have a common element p, and where,\nmoreover, the indicated weaker identity fails, let us take for S the same set as in\nthe above example, with the addition of one arbitrary point r outside the circle,\nat distance \u2265 2 from 0. This time, let q1 , . . . , q2n+6 be the successive vertices of\na regular (2n+6)-gon on S, placed so that qn+2 lies on the line connecting 0 with\nthe external point r. For i = 1, . . . , n+1, let yi = {q1 , . . . , qn+3 } \u2212 {qi }, and let\nx = {qn+3 , . . . , q2n+4 }. We note that the set of subscripts of the q 's occurring in\neach of these sets lies in an interval of length < n+3, so the absence of the point\n0 does not contradict convexity of these sets relative to S. Taking p = qn+3 we\nsee that all of these sets belong to RelConv(S)\u2265{p} .\nAs in the previous example, the intersection of any n of the y 's contains one of\nq1 , . . . , qn+1 , and x contains its antipodal point, so that the join of x with that\nintersection contains 0, hence so does the intersection of all these joins, i.e., the\nvalue of the right-hand side of Dnop at these arguments. On the other hand, the\nintersection of all the y 's is {qn+2 , qn+3 }, and the union of this set with x still has\nall subscripts lying in an interval of length < n+3, so the join of those two sets,\nthe left-hand side of Dnop , does not contain 0. Hence if we take z \u2032 = {qn+3 , 0},\nthe intersection of the right-hand side of Dnop with z \u2032 is z \u2032 = {qn+3 , 0}, while\nintersection of the left-hand side with z \u2032 is {qn+3 }. If, finally, we let z = {qn+3 , r}\nand take the joins of this element with those two intersections, we see that in the\nfirst case the resulting set contains the point qn+2 , since we assumed this to V\nlie on\nthe line-segment from 0 to r, while in the second, it V\ndoes not. Since qn+2 \u2208 i yi ,\nthe two sets remain Vdistinct on intersecting with i yi , showing the failure of\n\u0003\n(((Dnop ) \u2227 z \u2032 ) \u2228 z) \u2227 ( i yi ).\nThe above example in R2 is also an example in Rn for any n \u2265 2. For completeness, we should also consider dimensions n = 0 and 1. If we look at the chain\nof varieties corresponding to that of Lemma 1, but with each V(Conv(Rn )) replaced by the variety generated by all the lattices RelConv(S) for subsets S \u2286 Rn ,\nand each V(Conv(Rn )\u2265{0} ) by the variety generated by lattices RelConv(S)\u2265{p} ,\nthen we see that the first term of this chain is still the trivial variety and the next\ntwo still satisfy the distributive identity (in the last case, by the final assertion of\nProposition 25 for n = 1). Since the distributive identity implies the identities of\nevery nontrivial variety, we conclude that allowing lattices of relatively convex sets\nhas not enlarged the varieties we get at these three steps. We have just shown the\ncontrary from the fifth step on; this leaves only the fourth step, i.e., the relation between V(Conv(R1 )) and the variety generated by all lattices of form RelConv(S)\nwith S \u2286 R1 . Here again, it turns out that we have equality. This follows from our\nobservation that RelConv(S) is isomorphic to the lattice of convex hulls of subsets\nof S, together with\n\n\fON LATTICES OF CONVEX SETS IN Rn\n\n27\n\nLemma 27. Let S be a subset of R1 . Then the convex hulls of subsets of S form\na sublattice of Conv(R1 ).\nProof. We have noted, for arbitrary n and S \u2286 Rn , that the convex hulls of subsets\nof S are closed under the join operation of the full lattices of convex sets, so we need\nonly show them closed under meets, i.e., intersections, when n = 1. This comes\ndown to showing that if p \u2208 c.h.(x) \u2229 c.h.(y), where x and y are relatively convex\nsubsets of S, then p \u2208 c.h.(x \u2229 y). The case where p \u2208 S is immediate, so assume\nthe contrary. The fact that p \u2208 c.h.(x) then means that q1 < p < q2 for some\nq1 , q2 \u2208 x; similarly, q3 < p < q4 for some q3 , q4 \u2208 y. From the relative convexity of\nx and y and the order-relations of these elements, we now see that max(q1 , q3 ) \u2208\nx \u2229 y and min(q2 , q4 ) \u2208 x \u2229 y. Hence p \u2208 c.h.(max(q1 , q3 ), min(q2 , q4 )) \u2286 c.h.(x \u2229\ny).\n\u0003\nFor further results on V(Conv(R1 )) and its subvarieties, see [17].\nIncidentally, the lattice RelConv(S), for S the set used in first part of the\nproof of Lemma 26 (consisting of the unit\nV circle and its center) shows that none\nop\nof the identities (((Dm\n) \u2227 z \u2032 ) \u2228 z) \u2227 ( i yi ) implies any of the identities Dnop .\nIndeed, we showed that RelConv(S) satisfies none of the latter identities; let us\nnow show that (unlike the lattice considered in the second part of that proof) it\nsatisfies all of the former. It suffices to verify the strongest of these, the case n = 1.\nWriting S = C \u222a {0}, where C is the unit circle, we see that the map \u2212 \u2229 C :\nRelConv(S) \u2192 RelConv(C) = 2C is a homomorphism; so if two lattice expressions\nin x, y1 , y2 , z, z \u2032 are identically equal in distributive lattices, their values in\nRelConv(S) will always agree except, perhaps, as to whether they contain 0. We\nnow consider separately the cases 0 \u2208 y1 \u2227 y2 and 0 \u2208\n/ y1 \u2227 y2 . In the former case,\nthe two sides of D1op (x, y1 , y2 ) agree in containing 0, hence are equal, so a fortiori\nthe two sides of (((D1op ) \u2227 z \u2032 ) \u2228 z) \u2227 (y1 \u2227 y2 ) are equal. In the latter case, neither\nside of the latter relation can contain 0, hence again they are equal.\n12. The snowflake.\nLet us look at a particularly neat example of a lattice of relatively convex subsets\nof a set S.\nLet p1 , p2 , p3 , \u2212p1 , \u2212p2 , \u2212p3 be the successive vertices of a regular hexagon in\nR2 centered at 0. Let\nS1 = c.h.(p1 , \u2212p1 ),\n\nS2 = c.h.(p2 , \u2212p2 ),\n\nS3 = c.h.(p3 , \u2212p3 ),\n\nS = S1 \u222a S2 \u222a S3 ,\nand let L be the sublattice of RelConv(S)\u2265{0} generated by the three line-segments\nS1 , S2 and S3 . (In view of the form of S, I think of this example as \"the\nsnowflake\".)\nEvery element of L will clearly be centrally symmetric and topologically closed;\nhence every such element has the form\n\u03bb1 S1 \u222a \u03bb2 S2 \u222a \u03bb3 S3\n\n(\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , \u03bb3 \u2208 [0, 1]).\n\n(22)\n\n\f28\n\nGEORGE M. BERGMAN\n\nThe join of S1 and S2 in this lattice must have the form S1 \u222a S2 \u222a \u03bb S3 for\nsome \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1). (Elementary geometry shows that \u03bb = 1/2; but we don't need\nto know this now, and will get it from a general formula soon.) Intersecting this\njoin with S3 , we see that \u03bb S3 \u2208 L. By symmetry we also have \u03bb S1 , \u03bb S2 \u2208 L,\nand we see that these together generate a proper sublattice of L isomorphic to\nthe whole lattice. In particular, L has infinite descending chains of elements, e.g.,\nS1 > \u03bb S1 > \u03bb2 S1 > . . . .\nLet's figure out how to calculate in L. The first thing we should find are the\nconditions on \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 and \u03bb3 for a set (22) to be relatively convex. Calculation\nshows that for \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 and \u03bb3 nonzero, the points \u03bb1 p1 , \u03bb2 p2 and \u03bb3 p3 are\n\u22121\ncollinear if and only if \u03bb\u22121\n= \u03bb\u22121\n2\n1 + \u03bb3 . (In verifying this, the key relation is\np2 = p1 + p3 .) Hence we see that one necessary condition for the convexity of (22)\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\nis \u03bb\u22121\n2 \u2264 \u03bb1 + \u03bb3 ; by symmetry, the remaining conditions are \u03bb1 \u2264 \u03bb2 + \u03bb3\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\nand \u03bb3 \u2264 \u03bb1 + \u03bb2 . It is easy to verify that if the \u03bbi are also allowed to be zero,\nand we write 0\u22121 = \u221e and consider \u221e greater than all real numbers, then these\nthree conditions continue to be necessary and sufficient for convexity.\n\u22121\n\u22121\nLet us therefore index elements (22) by the three parameters \u03bb\u22121\n1 , \u03bb2 , \u03bb3 ,\ndefining\n\u22121\n\u22121\n[a1 , a2 , a3 ] = a\u22121\n1 S1 \u222a a 2 S2 \u222a a 3 S3\n\n(a1 , a2 , a3 \u2208 [1, \u221e]),\n\n(23)\n\nso that the lattice of centrally symmetric elements of RelConv(S)\u2265{0} consists of\nthe sets [a1 , a2 , a3 ] with\na1 \u2264 a2 + a3 ,\n\na2 \u2264 a1 + a3 ,\n\na3 \u2264 a1 + a2 .\n\n(24)\n\nNote that the ordering of this lattice is by reverse componentwise comparison of expressions [a1 , a2 , a3 ], and that S1 , S2 , S3 are the elements [1, \u221e, \u221e], [\u221e, 1, \u221e],\n[\u221e, \u221e, 1]. Lattice-theoretic meet is clearly given by componentwise supremum,\nwhile the lattice-theoretic join of two elements is gotten by first taking their componentwise infimum, which represents their set-theoretic union, then getting its\nrelative convex hull by reducing the largest entry to the sum of the other two if it\nexceeds this. So, for instance, S1 \u2228 S2 = [1, \u221e, \u221e] \u2228 [\u221e, 1, \u221e] is gotten by forming\nthe componentwise infimum, [1, 1, \u221e], and then decreasing the last component to\nthe sum of the first two, getting [1, 1, 2] (confirming the value \u03bb = 1/2 in our\nearlier description of this element). We can now calculate, e.g., the meet (componentwise supremum) of this with S3 = [\u221e, \u221e, 1], namely [\u221e, \u221e, 2]; and take\nthe join of this meet with S2 = [\u221e, 1, \u221e] by forming the componentwise infimum\n[\u221e, 1, 2], and adjusting the first component as above, getting [3, 1, 2].\nNote that the only way these lattice operations yield components in their values\nthat did not occur as components in their arguments is by addition; hence, as L\nwas defined to be generated by S1 , S2 and S3 , all finite components ai that\noccur in the expressions (23) for elements of L are positive integers. It is not hard\nto verify that all positive integers indeed occur, and that the elements of L are all\nthe elements (23) satisfying (24) with a1 , a2 , a3 \u2208 {1, 2, 3, . . . , \u221e}. So we have a\nvery arithmetic description of this lattice.\n\n\fON LATTICES OF CONVEX SETS IN Rn\n\n29\n\nThough we have seen that L contains an infinite descending chain, it is interesting to note that the sublattice generated by any finite set of elements (23),\nnone of which have any infinite components, is finite; for the lattice operations will\nnot produce, in any position, entries larger than the corresponding entries of their\narguments.\nIt would be of interest to examine more general lattices of the form RelConv(S)\u2265{0}\nfor sets S which are unions of finitely many line-segments (or rays) through the\norigin in Rn . In this situation, the conditions for convexity are always given by\nlinear inequalities in the \" \u03bb\u22121\ni \"; let me sketch why.\nFirst, some general observations. Suppose p1 , . . . , pm (m \u2265 3) are a minimal\nlinearly dependent\nfamily of vectors in Rn ; thus they satisfy a nontrivial linear\nP\nrelation\nci pi = 0, unique up to scalars. For which families of positive real\nnumbers \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbm will the points \u03bb1 p1 , . . . , \u03bbm pm lie in an (m\u22121)-dimensional\naffine subspace of their m-dimensional span? This will hold if and only if the linear\nrelation satisfied by these modified elements is an affine relation; i.e., has coefficients\nsumming to 0. Those coefficients are ci \u03bb\u22121\ni , so the condition is\nP\n\u22121\nci \u03bbi = 0.\nIn this situation, can the affine relation among the \u03bbi pi be written as an expression\nfor one of them, say \u03bbj pj , as a convex linear combination of the others? One sees\nthat this is so if and only if the coefficient cj is opposite in sign to all the other ci ;\nin that situation, let us rewrite the expression satisfied by the \u03bbi\u22121 as\nP\n\u22121\n\u03bb\u22121\n= \u2212c\u22121\nj\nj\ni6=j ci \u03bbi .\nNote that the abovementioned condition on signs can be satisfied by at most one\nj, and can be looked at as saying that the ray determined by the corresponding\nvector pj is in the convex hull of the rays determined\nby the other pi . When it\nS\nis satisfied, one finds that a union of intervals i [0, \u03bbi pi ] is relatively convex in\nthe union of the rays determined by the pi if and only if \u03bbj has at least the value\ngiven by the above formula, i.e., if and only if\nP\n\u22121\n(25)\n\u03bb\u22121\n\u2264 \u2212c\u22121\nj\nj\ni6=j ci \u03bbi .\nIf the ci do not consist of one of one sign and the rest of the opposite sign, then\nnone\nS of the rays determined by the pi is in the convex hull of the rest, and every set\ni [0, \u03bbi pi ] (\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbm > 0) is relatively convex. (An example of this situation is\ngiven for n = 3 by letting p1 , . . . , p4 be the vertices of a convex quadrilateral lying\nin a plane not containing 0.)\nLet us now drop the condition that the pi are minimal among linearly dependent families, assuming only that none of them is a nonnegative multiple of\nanother (i.e., that they determine distinct rays), and let S denote the union of\nthe rays through\n0 that they determine. Then one can show that a union of\nS\nintervals i [0, \u03bbi pi ] is relatively convex in S if and only if (25) holds for each\nminimal linearly dependent family of \u2265 3 of the pi whose unique linear relation\nhas exactly one coefficient cj of different sign from the rest. (The reduction to the\nminimal-linearly-independent-family case can be gotten by a recursive application\n\n\f30\n\nGEORGE M. BERGMAN\n\nof Carath\u00e9odory's Theorem, with p0 = 0, within subspaces spanned by successively\nsmaller subsets of {p1 , . . . , pn }.)\nAs an example of the sort of lattice one gets, let us drop the central-symmetry\ncondition from our snowflake construction, writing \u2212p1 , \u2212p2 , \u2212p3 as p4 , p5 , p6 ,\nand considering general sets\n\u03bb1 c.h.(0, p1 ) \u222a . . . \u222a \u03bb6 c.h.(0, p6 )\nThen setting ai =\n\n\u03bb\u22121\ni ,\n\n(\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bb6 \u2208 (0, \u221e]).\n\nwe get six conditions for relative convexity, namely\n\na2 \u2264 a1 + a3 ,\n\na3 \u2264 a2 + a4 ,\n\n...,\n\na1 \u2264 a6 + a2 ,\n\neach corresponding to the fact that one of our six rays lies in the cone spanned by\nits two immediate neighbors.\nOur snowflake example showed that a lattice RelConv(S)\u2265{0} could contain a\n3-generator sublattice with an infinite descending chain. Let me sketch an example\nwith an infinite ascending chain. In R2 , let\np1 = (0, 3),\n\np2 = (1, 2),\n\np3 = (2, 1),\n\np4 = (3, 0).\n\n(Or for a more abstract description, take any four points of Rn in arithmetic\nprogression, on a line not passing through the origin.) Define\nSi = c.h.(0, pi ) and S = S1 \u222a S2 \u222a S3 \u222a S4 .\nNow let L be the sublattice of RelConv(S)\u2265{0} generated by\nx1 = S1 \u222a (S2 /2),\n\ny = S2 \u222a S3 ,\n\nx2 = (S3 /2) \u222a S4 .\n\nIt is easy to see from a sketch that, starting with x1 \u2227 y, if we alternately apply\n(\u2212 \u2228 x2 ) \u2227 y and (\u2212 \u2228 x1 ) \u2227 y, we obtain an infinite ascending chain of subsets.\nIs the existence of infinite chains in sublattices of lattices RelConv(S) generated\nby few elements limited to cases where S 6= Rn , or does it also occur in lattices\nConv(Rn )? To get a large part of the answer without any computation, recall that\nRelConv(S) is isomorphic to the lattice of convex hulls in Rn of subsets of S.\nThis lattice, which we shall here denote LS , is a subset but not a sublattice of\nConv(Rn ); however, in cases like those considered above, where S is a finite union\nof convex sets, S = S1 \u222a * * * \u222a Sm , we can write the operations of this lattice as\n\"polynomial operations\" in those of Conv(Rn ). Namely, temporarily writing \u2227S\nand \u2228S for the operations of LS , and \u2227 and \u2228 for those of Conv(Rn ), we get,\nfor x, y \u2208 LS ,\nW\n(26)\nx \u2228S y = x \u2228 y,\nx \u2227S y = i (x \u2227 y \u2227 Si ).\nHence if the sublattice of LS generated by elements y1 , . . . , yk has an infinite\nascending or descending chain (or any other specified join-sublattice), so will the\nsublattice of Conv(Rn ) generated by y1 , . . . , yk , S1 , . . . , Sm . In the case of our\n\"snowflake lattice\", the y 's and the S 's happen to be the same, so we immediately\nconclude that the sublattice of Conv(R2 )\u2265{0} generated by those three elements\nhas an infinite descending chain. From our example with an ascending chain, the\nbest conclusion this general argument gives is that the sublattice of Conv(R2 )\u2265{0}\ngenerated by the six elements S1 , S2 , S3 , S4 , S2 /2 and S3 /2 has an infinite\n\n\fON LATTICES OF CONVEX SETS IN Rn\n\n31\n\nascending chain. Nevertheless, a little diagram-drawing shows that in this case,\nthe sublattice of Conv(R2 )\u2265{0} generated by the three elements c.h.(x1 ), c.h.(x2 )\nand c.h.(y) shows essentially the same behavior as our lattice of relatively convex\nsubsets.\nI do not know any examples of 3-generator lattices of convex sets (relative or\nabsolute) that have both infinite ascending and descending chains, or that have\ninfinite antichains. On the other hand, it is not hard to show that the 4-generator\nsublattice of Conv(R2 ) generated by the diameters of a regular octagon has all\nthree.\n\n13. Notes on related work on relatively convex sets, and some further\nobservations.\nThe lattices RelConv(S) are examples of what are known as convex geometries;\nfor the definition, and results on these, see [7], [1].\nHuhn [11] looked briefly at lattices of relatively convex sets determined by finite\nsets S \u2286 Rn for the purpose of \"approximating\" Conv(Rn ) by finite lattices, and\nfor the same purpose he considered in [10, \u00a72] the dual construction, namely the\nlattice of those subsets of Rn which can be represented as intersections of members\nof a given finite set of closed half-spaces. Not surprisingly in view of the dual natures\nof these two sorts of relativization, he found that lattices of the latter sort satisfied\nthe identities of the form Dnop that he had obtained in the nonrelativized lattice,\nbut not those of the form Dn (cf. Proposition 25 and Lemma 26 above).\nIn [19] it is shown that for every finite lattice L which is \"lower bounded\"\n(a strengthening of join semidistributive), there exist an n and a finite subset\nS \u2286 Qn such that L is embeddable in the sublattice of Conv(Rn ) generated by\n{{p} | p \u2208 S}. Clearly, such an embedding will send all members of L to convex\npolytopes; if we let S \u2032 denote the union of the vertex-sets of this finite set of\npolytopes, it is not hard to see that we get an embedding of L in RelConv(S \u2032 ).\nWhether embeddability in the lattice of relatively convex sets of a finite subset\nof Rn holds not only for lower bounded lattices, but for all join-semidistributive\nlattices, is an open question [19, Problem 1], cf. [1, Problem 3]. It is also shown\nin [19] that every lattice can be embedded in the lattice of convex subsets of some\ninfinite-dimensional vector space (over an arbitrary totally ordered division ring).\nIn particular, such lattices need not satisfy any nontrivial lattice identities. In\ncontrast, the lattice of subspaces of any vector space satisfies the modular identity\nand others.\nHere is another embedding result using not necessarily finite-dimensional vector\nspaces, although it may be seen that the connection with convexity is somewhat\nartificial, based on the fact that subspaces are in particular convex sets; it is essentially a result on lattices of \"relative subspaces\". (Since most of the results in this\nnote concerned subspaces of Rn , we only gave our general definitions for that case,\nbut we shall use them here without that restriction.)\n\n\f32\n\nGEORGE M. BERGMAN\n\nLemma 28. Let V be a real vector space and B a basis of V. For each pair of\ndistinct elements a, b \u2208 B, let Sa,b be the subspace of V spanned by a \u2212 b. Define\nthe set\nS\nS = a,b Sa,b \u2286 V.\nThen the following lattices are isomorphic:\n(a) The lattice Equiv(B) of all equivalence relations on B  \u030a\n(ordered by inclu \u030a\nsion).\n(b) The lattice RelSubSp(S) consisting of all sets of the form S \u2229 U where U\nis a subspace of V.  \u030a\n(Here meet is given by intersection; join by taking the subspace\nspanned by the union of the sets in question, and intersecting this with S.)\n(b\u2032 ) The lattice of all subspaces of V spanned by subsets of S.  \u030a\n(The join of two\nsuch subspaces W1 , W2 is W1 + W2 , the meet is the span of W1 \u2229 W2 \u2229 S.)\n(c) The sublattice of RelConv(S) consisting of all elements thereof that are\nunions of subspaces Sa,b .\n(c\u2032 ) The lattice of all subsets of V which are convex hulls of unions of subpaces\nSa,b .  \u030a\n(Join as in Conv(Rn ), while the meet of x1 , x2 is c.h.(x1 \u2229 x2 \u2229 S)).\nProof. That the sets described in (b), (b\u2032 ) and (c\u2032 ), ordered by inclusion, form\nlattices, with meet and join as described, is immediate.\nNote that the convex hull of a union of subspaces of V is the sum of those\nsubspaces, and that the intersection of S with a subspace is always a union of\ncertain of the Sa,b . From this it is easily seen that (b) and (c) are not merely, as\nasserted, isomorphic, but equal, and likewise (b\u2032 ) and (c\u2032 ). It is also clear that (b)\nis isomorphic to (b\u2032 ), via the \"span of\" map in one direction and the operator\n\u2212 \u2229 S in the other. So these four lattices are isomorphic; to complete the proof we\nshall describe an isomorphism between the lattice Equiv(B) of (a) and the lattice\nof (b\u2032 ).\nGiven an equivalence relation R \u2208 Equiv(B), let \u03c6(R) be the subspace of V\nspanned by all elements a \u2212 b with (a, b) \u2208 R, which by definition belongs to (b\u2032 ),\nwhile given a subspace W \u2286 V spanned by a subset of S, let \u03c8(W ) = {(a, b) |\na \u2212 b \u2208 W }, which it is easy to check is an equivalence relation on B. The maps\n\u03c6 and \u03c8 are clearly isotone, and from the definition of (b\u2032 ), we see that \u03c6\u03c8 is\nthe identity function thereof; moreover, for any R \u2208 Equiv(B) it is clear that\n\u03c8(\u03c6(R)) \u2265 R, so it remains to prove the reverse inequality.\nSo suppose that (a, b) \u2208 \u03c8(\u03c6(R)), i.e., that a \u2212 b \u2208 \u03c6(R). From the definition\nof \u03c6(R) it is easy to see that for each R-equivalence class C \u2286 B, the sum of\nthe coefficients of all members of C in any element of \u03c6(R) is zero. But the only\nway this can hold for a \u2212 b is if a and b are in the same equivalence class, i.e.,\n(a, b) \u2208 R, as required to complete our proof.\n\u0003\nPudl\u00e1k and T\u016fma [18] have shown that every finite lattice L embeds in Equiv(X)\nfor some finite set X. Hence by the above lemma, for every such L one can find an\nn and a subset S \u2286 Rn such that L is embeddable in RelConv(S). It would be\ninteresting to know whether this same conclusion can be proved without using the\ndeep result of [18]. So far as is known, the embedding of L in a lattice Equiv(X)\n\n\fON LATTICES OF CONVEX SETS IN Rn\n\n33\n\nmay require a set X whose cardinality is enormous compared with that of L (see\n[14], [12] for some improvements on the bound of [18]), but it is plausible that one\ncould do better with embeddings in lattices of relatively convex sets.\nOur final remark will concern the observations at the end of the preceding section\non the form of the lattice operations of RelConv(S) when S is a finite union of\nconvex sets S1 \u222a * * * \u222a Sm . Let us put these in a more general context. (Readers\nallergic to category theory may ignore this discussion.)\nLet Lattice denote the category of all lattices, objects of which we will here\nwrite L = (|L|, \u2228, \u2227), distinguishing between the lattice L and its underlying\nset |L|. For m a natural number, let Latticem-pt denote the category of lattices\nwith m distinguished elements, i.e., of systems (|L|, \u2228, \u2227, S1 , . . . , Sm ) such that\n(|L|, \u2228, \u2227) is a lattice and S1 , . . . , Sm \u2208 |L|, and where a morphism between\nsuch systems means a lattice homomorphism which respects the ordered m-tuple of\ndistinguished elements. Let us, finally, write Latticeint for the category of objects\n(|L|, \u2228, \u2227, int), where (|L|, \u2228, \u2227) is a lattice, and int is an \"interior operator\"\n(the dual of a closure operator), that is, a map |L| \u2192 |L| satisfying\nint(x) \u2264 x,\n\nx \u2264 y =\u21d2 int(x) \u2264 int(y),\n\nint(int(x)) = int(x).\n\n(Here by \" u \u2264 v\" we of course mean u = u \u2227 v, equivalently, u \u2228 v = v.) The morphisms of Latticeint will be the lattice homomorphisms respecting this additional\noperation.\nWe can define a functor Latticem-pt \u2192 Latticeint taking each object (|L|, \u2228, \u2227,\nS1 , . . . , Sm ) to the object (|L|, \u2228, \u2227, int(Si ) ), where the interior operator is defined\nby\nW\nint(Si ) (x) = i (x \u2227 Si ),\nand another functor Latticeint \u2192 Lattice, taking each object (|L|, \u2228, \u2227, int) to\nthe object (|L|int , \u2228, \u2227int ), where\n|L|int = {x \u2208 |L| | x = int(x)}\n\nand x \u2227int y = int(x \u2227 y).\n\n(It is not hard to verify that the join operation of L carries |L|int into itself.)\nWe now see that if we take L = Conv(Rn ), and let S1 , . . . , Sm be any m\nelements of this lattice, then the composite of the above two functors, applied to\n(|L|, \u2228, \u2227, S1 , . . . , Sm ), gives precisely the lattice we named LS \u223c\n= RelConv(S),\nfor S = S1 \u222a * * * \u222a Sm .\nThe constructions given by the above functor Latticeint \u2192 Lattice, and its\ndual, with a closure operator replacing the interior operator, are well-known, if not\nin this functorial form. I do not know whether the construction Latticem-pt \u2192\nLatticeint (and its variant with lattices replaced by complete lattices and the\nspecified finite family by an arbitrary family) has been considered.\nStepping back a little further, we may observe that the lattice Conv(Rn ) arises\nn\nas the fixed set of the closure operator c.h.(\u2212) on the lattice 2R of subsets of Rn ,\nso that the construction of the mutually isomorphic lattices LS and RelConv(S)\ncan be seen as arising from the interaction of the closure operator c.h.(\u2212) and the\nn\ninterior operator \u2212 \u2229 S on 2R . Again, this situation can be made into a general\nconstruction.\n\n\f34\n\nGEORGE M. BERGMAN\n\nThe reader familiar with the concept of representable algebra-valued functors\n([3, Chapter 9] or [4, \u00a71, \u00a78]) will be happy to observe that all the functors of the\nabove discussion are representable.\n14. A question.\nThe referee has pointed out that some properties of the lattice of convex sets are\nknown to change if the base field R is replaced by another ordered field (e.g., Q),\nbut that the arguments of \u00a7\u00a71-6 look as though they should work over any ordered\nfield; perhaps even any ordered division ring. I have the same feeling, but as as an\namateur in the area, I will leave this question to others. (I do not know whether the\ntheorems of Helly, Carath\u00e9odory and Radon hold in that context, nor how much of\nwhat I have justified as geometrically evident may rely on properties of the reals.)\nA straightforward generalization of these results could not, of course, extend\nto \u00a77, on compact convex sets, since over an ordered field which is not locally\ncompact, the only nonempty compact convex sets are the singletons, which do not\nform a lattice. One might be able to prove results like those of that section with\n\"compact\" replaced by \"closed and bounded\", but new proofs would be needed,\nsince the theorem of Minkowski we used there is not true in that context. Later\nsections depend to varying degrees on that one.\nReferences\n[1] K. V. Adaricheva, V. A. Gorbunov and V. I.
