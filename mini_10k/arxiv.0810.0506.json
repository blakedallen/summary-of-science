Introduction\nOver the past decade up to 290 extra-solar planets were discovered using the wobble method (i.e. measuring the motion of\nparent star around the planet-star's center of mass). This represents about 95% of the total extra-solar planets known to date1\nHowever, this is an indirect method in which the presence of a\nplanet is inferred from the detection of the radial velocity variations. Therefore, in cases where the presence of the planet can\nnot be confirmed by other methods we may ask if these variations could be due to another dynamical effect. In particular,\nwhen a planet is detected in a system already hosting a companion (such as another planet or a star), we must be cautious when\nwe analyze the data, because different configurations of bodies\ncan lead to similar radial velocity variations.\nThe present paper is motivated by the work of\nSchneider & Cabrera (2006) who studied a triple system\ncomposed of a binary star system with equal masses orbiting a\nthird star (assumed massless). They concluded that the binary\nsystem will cause a wobble in the star's motion that could\nmimic the presence of a planet companion. Therefore, they\nsuggest that each extra-solar planet detection which relies on\nthe measurement of this wobble must be carefully checked for\nthe presence of possible nearby unresolved binaries.\nUnfortunately the study in Schneider & Cabrera (2006) was\nrestricted to the case of binary systems composed of stars with\nequal masses, while a multitude of three-body configurations can\nbe imagined. In particular, we may wonder about the effect of\na giant satellite orbiting an already detected Jupiter-like extrasolar planet. Moreover, the conclusions in Schneider & Cabrera\n(2006) were derived in the framework of the restricted threebody problem and we may also question the validity of this\napproximation. Additionally, we found that their work contains\nseveral inaccurate conclusions.\nSend offprint requests to: A.C.M. Correia, e-mail: correia@ua.pt\n1\nThe Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia. http://exoplanet.eu/\n\nOur goal is to correctly model the effect of a binary system\non a nearby star without making any assumptions on the masses\nof this triple system. In Sect. 2 we briefly review the wobble\nmethod for detecting planets. In Sect. 3 we derive simple expressions for the radial velocity of a star under the presence of a\nnearby binary system and for the orbital parameters of a planet\nmimicked by this effect. In Sect. 4 we give some examples of binary systems and present numerical simulations to test the theoretical results. Finally, the last section is devoted to a discussion\nof the results.\n\n2. The wobble method\nWe quickly review the wobble method for detecting extra-solar\nplanets (see for instance Hilditch 2001). Assume that we are observing a star with mass M\u22c6 , which has a planet companion with\nmass M p . A possible observation reference frame is depicted in\nFig.1a where we have the x\u0302 and \u1e91 axes along the line of nodes\nand the line of sight, respectively. The orbital plane (\u0131\u0302, \uf6be\u0302) is depicted in Fig.1b, where \u0131\u0302 \u2261 x\u0302. In this last frame the position of\nthe star/planet can be written as\nr = X \u0131\u0302 + Y \uf6be\u0302 = r cos(\u031f + f ) \u0131\u0302 + r sin(\u031f + f ) \uf6be\u0302 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere r is the orbital radius, f the true anomaly, and \u031f the longitude of the perihelium.\nSince \u0131\u0302 \u2261 x\u0302, the \uf6be\u0302 axis is simply obtained with a rotation\nof the \u0177 axis by an angle I, the inclination of the orbital plane\nmeasured with respect to the plane ( x\u0302, \u0177). Thus, we may write\nz = Y sin I, where z is the position along the \u1e91 axis. The velocity\nalong the line of sight is then\n\u017c = \u1e8e sin I\n= (\u1e59 sin(\u031f + f ) + r f \u0307 cos(\u031f + f )) sin I\n\u0002\n\u0003\n= Kz cos(\u031f + f ) + e cos \u031f ,\n\n(2)\n\n\u221a\nwhere e is the orbital eccentricity and Kz = n a p sin I/ 1 \u2212 e2 ,\nwith n the mean motion, and a p the semi-major axis of the orbit.\n\n\f2\n\nM.H.M. Morais and A.C.M. Correia: Stellar wobble caused by a binary system\n\nz\n\n(a)\n\n3. The model and its predictions\nWe will work in the framework of the planar general three body\nproblem: we assume that a star with mass M\u22c6 moves in the same\norbital plane as the binary system composed of two bodies with\nmasses M1 and M2 (Fig. 2).\nj\n\nM2\n\u00fb\n\nrb\n\ny\nI\n\ni\n\nj\n\nS\nCM\n\nM1\n\nx\n(b)\n\n\u03b8\ni\n\nj\n\nr\n\nM*\n\nFig. 2. Jacobi coordinates (rb , r). The system is composed by a\nstar with mass M\u22c6 and a binary with masses M1 and M2 . We\nassume co-planar motion and the frame (\u0131\u0302, \uf6be\u0302) is the same from\nFig.1. \u00fb is a unit vector normal to r, S = \u2220(r, r b ) and \u03b8 = \u2220(\u0131\u0302, r).\n\nf\n\u03c0\ni\n\n3.1. Equations of motion\n\nFig. 1. Reference frames. The plane defined by ( x\u0302, \u0177) is the plane\nof the sky and the \u1e91 axis is along the line of sight. The plane (\u0131\u0302, \uf6be\u0302)\nis the orbital plane, \u031f the argument of the perihelium and f the\ntrue anomaly. For simplicity we chose the x\u0302 axis along the line\nof nodes (\u0131\u0302 \u2261 x\u0302).\n\nIn order to obtain the equations of motion we will use Jacobi\ncanonical coordinates, which are, respectively, the inter-binary\ndistance, r b , and the distance, r, from the star M\u22c6 to the\nbinary's CM (see Fig. 2). We will additionaly assume that\n|r b | \u226a |r|. Thus, to the second order in \u03c1 = |r b |/|r| \u226a 1, the\nHamiltonian of the system can be expressed as (e.g. Henrard\n1979; Murray & Dermott 1999):\nM1 M2\nMM\u22c6\n1 | pb |2 1 | p|2\n\u2212G\n\u2212G\n+\n(6)\n2 \u03bc\n2 \u03bc\u22c6\nrb\nr\n\u0011\nM1 M2 M\u22c6 2 1 \u0010\n\u2212G\n3 cos2 S \u2212 1 ,\n\u03c1\nrM\n2\nwhere M = M1 + M2 is the total mass of the binary, S = \u2220(r, r b ),\nH =\n\nThe radial velocity of the star is the projection of the velocity\nwith respect to the center of mass (CM) along the line of sight.

Notice that if we chose M\u22c6 = 0 and M1 =\nM2 (binary with equal masses) in Eq.(19) we recover the same\nequation of motion obtained by Schneider & Cabrera (2006).\n\nIn Appendix A we determine the solution to Eq.(19) in the\ninertial frame (\u0131\u0302, \uf6be\u0302) with coordinates r\u22c6 = (X, Y), that is:\n!\n!\n!\n!\n3 \u03b4 sin 2S\nsin \u03b8 cos \u03b8\na\u22c6 cos \u03b8\nX\n,\n(20)\n+\n=\n4.5 \u03b4 cos 2S\n\u2212 cos \u03b8 sin \u03b8\na\u22c6 sin \u03b8\nY\nwith a\u22c6 \u2248 aM/(M + M\u22c6 ), \u03b8 = \u03b80 + \u03a9 t and\n\u03bc \u0012 ab \u00134\n\u03b4=\nab .\n8M a\n\n(21)\n\nThis solution has two components, the first one caused by the\nmotion of the star around the binary's CM and the second one is\nthe stellar wobble caused by the the movement of the two bodies\nof the binary around its own CM.\nAccording to our choice of reference frame (Fig.1), the radial\nvelocity of the star M\u22c6 is given by Vr = \u1e8e sin I, that is, we can\nobtain it directly from the Y coordinate. From Eq.(20) we have:\nY = a\u22c6 sin \u03b8 \u2212 3 \u03b4 sin 2S cos \u03b8 + 4.5 \u03b4 cos 2S sin \u03b8 ,\n\n(22)\n\nBecause \u1e60 = \u03c9 \u2212 \u03a9 and \u03b8\u0307 = \u03a9, and since we assume \u03a9 \u226a \u03c9,\nthe velocity along \u0177 is then\n\u1e8e = a\u22c6 \u03a9 cos \u03b8 \u2212 6\u03c9\u03b4 cos 2S cos \u03b8 \u2212 9\u03c9\u03b4 sin 2S sin \u03b8 .\n\n(23)\n\nThe first term in Eq.(23) is due to the slow motion of the star\naround the binary's CM. The second and third terms are due to\nthe binary wobble. These last two terms can be seen as a composition of two periodic signals, one fast with frequency 2\u03c9 \u2212 2\u03a9\nand another much slower with frequency \u03a9. The global effect of\nthe binary wobble corresponds to a signal of period \u03c0/(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03a9)\nwith an amplitude modulation of 3\u03c9\u03b4 and period \u03c0/\u03a9 (Fig.3).\n3.5. Mimicking a planet\n\nEven though the radial velocity of a star perturbed by a binary\nsystem is not given by a single periodic signal (Fig.3), we may\nask under what circumstances this signal can be misinterpreted\nas a planet orbiting the star. We can rewrite Eq.(23) in the same\nformat as Eq.(3), i.e.\nVr = K0 cos(\u03b80 + \u03a9 t) + Vrb ,\n\n(24)\n\nwhere K0 = a\u22c6 \u03a9 sin I and\nVrb = K1 cos(\u031f1 + n1 t) + K2 cos(\u031f2 + n2 t) ,\n\n(25)\n\n\f4\n\nM.H.M.

We recall that we may not know about the presence of the binary (since\none or even both components may be unresolved) and this term\nallows us to identify only a single component.\nOn the other hand, Vrb is the radial velocity due to the binary wobble around its own CM and can be identified as two\nplanets on circular orbits around the star. Hence, contrarily to\nSchneider & Cabrera (2006), we conclude that the stellar wobble caused by the presence of the binary mimics not one, but\ntwo planets, although with very close orbital periods. As the two\nfrequencies n1 and n2 are very close, in some situations the two\nsignals can be confounded and the observer can erroneously believe to have found a planetary companion to the star.\nThis will be the case if our instrument is at the limit of its\nresolution: since |K1 | = 5 |K2 |, the trace of the second \"planet\"\nis harder to detect. Therefore, if our spectral resolution is close\nto the detection limit of the stellar wobble, we can notice the\npresence of the first \"planet\", but we will miss the second one.\nBy applying Kepler's 3rd law, we obtain for the semi-major\naxis of this fake planet,\n(GM\u22c6 )1/3 \u0012 M\u22c6 \u00131/3\nap =\nab ,\n(29)\n\u2248\n4M\nn2/3\n1\nand for the planet's mass, we replace K1 from Eq.(26) in Eq.(5):\nMp\n15 \u03b4 \u03c9\n15 \u03bc \u0012 ab \u00134 ab\n=\n\u2248\n.\n(30)\nM + M\u22c6\n2 a p n1 32 M a a p\nNotice that when M1 = M2 our estimate for the planet's mass\nis different from what was obtained by Schneider & Cabrera\n(2006). Additionally, we also conclude that the planet evolves\nin a circular orbit (while e = 0.745 from Eq.4 of\nSchneider & Cabrera 2006).\n3.6. Distinguishing between a binary and a planet\n\nThe situation described above is very likely and we may expect to interpret erroneously the signal of a binary as a planet.\nHowever, the radial velocity wobble produced by a binary\n\n(Eq.25), is different from the radial velocity produced by a single planet (Eq.3) and therefore we may be able to distinguish\nbetween the two situations.\nIndeed, if we acquire data for long enough time (so that we\ncan constrain well \u03a9) and if the precision of the instrument is\nat the limit of detection of the amplitude K2 , the observer will\nbe able to notice the presence of the two periodic signals n1 and\nn2 (Eq.27) and therefore realize that the star is undergoing the\nperturbation from a binary and not from a planet.\nSince the radial velocity of the binary (Eq.25) is the same\nas the signal produced by two planets in circular orbits, the observer can also believe that two planets have been found (instead\nof the binary). However, as long as \u03a9 \u226a \u03c9, the two orbital frequencies n1 and n2 are very close and probably the orbits of the\ntwo planets cannot be stable.\nFor higher \u03a9 values, the system may become stable (although the approximation \u03a9 \u226a \u03c9 may not be valid) and\nthe hypothesis of existence of two planets cannot be excluded.\nNevertheless, in the case of a binary, the frequencies (n1 , n2 ) and\nthe amplitudes (K1 , K2 ) are not independent (Eqs.27 and 26) and\nthe following relations must be verified:\nn2 \u2212 n1 = 2\u03a9 and |K1 | = 5 |K2 | .\n\n(31)\n\n3.7. What kind of binary can mimic a planet?\n\nIn Sect. 3.5 we saw that under some particular conditions, the\nvariations in the star's radial velocity resulting from the binary\nwobble can be misinterpreted as a planet. Thus, if we detect a\nplanet and we do not know about the presence of the binary system (e.g. if M2 is unresolved) we can ask the following question: what are the parameters of an hypothetical binary system\nthat can mimic this planet? More precisely, if we know M\u22c6 , M1 ,\na, M p and a p , what are the values of M2 and ab ? These can be\nobtained by inverting Eqs.(29) and (30):\n!1/3\n4M\n(GM)1/3\n\u2248\nap ,\nM\u22c6\n( 21 n1 + 23 \u03a9)2/3\n!4\n\u0012\nM\u22c6 \u0013\n16 n1 a p a\n\u03bc 1+\n=\nMp\nM\n15 \u03c9 ab ab\n\u0012 M \u00135/3 a !4\n\u22c6\nMp .\n\u2248 0.212\nM\nap\nab =\n\n(32)\n(33)\n\nIn Table 1 we list all the currently known planets in close\nbinary systems (a < 100 AU) and estimate the corresponding\ncompanions' parameters (M2 and ab ) that can mimic that planet.\nThree of the cases provide unrealistic binary systems with very\nhigh values of M2 . The remaining three casesare are acceptable\n\n\fM.H.M. Morais and A.C.M. Correia: Stellar wobble caused by a binary system\n\n(\u03b3 Cep A, HD 41004 A, and HD 196885 A) but these binary systems are likely to be unstable as \u03b1 is near the stability limit (see\nEq.10). On the other hand, the values of M2 in these three cases\nare in the mass range of either black-holes or very bright stars\n(which should be detectable). Therefore, it is unlikely that these\nplanets can be the result of a binary wobble.\n\n4. Examples\nIn Sect. 3 we obtained the radial velocity wobble of a star that is\nperturbed by a binary system. We subsequently derived theoretical expressions that allow us to determine the orbital parameters\nof a planet that can, in some circumstances, be mimicked by\nthose variations. In this section we will present some concrete\nexamples of binary systems together with the orbital parameters\nof the planets that they can mimic. We also obtain the amplitude\nof the peaks in the radial velocity curve since these give an indication of the instrument precision needed to detect the planet\nand to distinguish between the planet and binary.\n4.1. Theory versus numerical integrations\n\nIn order to test the theoretical predictions of our model (Sect. 3),\nwe performed some numerical simulations of three-body systems (Tab.4). Here we present in detail a case (Ex.#3, Tab.4) for\nwhich the current precision in the radial velocity measurements\n(\u223c 1 m/s) could lead to the erroneous announcement of a planet.\nThe hypothetical system is formed by a triplet of main sequence stars with different spectral types, G, K and M, and\nmasses M\u22c6 = 1.00 M\u2299 , M1 = 0.70 M\u2299 and M2 = 0.35 M\u2299 ,\nrespectively. The smaller K and M stars form a binary system on\na circular orbit with ab = 1.1 AU. The G-star is in a wider circular orbit around the close binary's CM, with a = 10 AU. Note\nthat the M star is much fainter than the K or G stars hence it\nrepresents the unresolved component of the binary. We also suppose that the system is co-planar and perpendicular to the line of\nsight (that is, sin I = 1).\nWe numerically integrated this stellar system and computed\nthe radial velocity of the G-star, the brightest body in the system.\nIn Table 2 we list 50 simulated observational data points for a\ntime span of about 10.5 years (from Feb. 2004 to Sep. 2014). We\nsupposed that the data was acquired with a precision of \u223c0.8 m/s,\nidentical to the HARPS spectrograph on the ESO 3.6-m telescope\nat La Silla (Chile), currently the most precise instrument in operation since the beginning of 2004 (Mayor et al. 2003).\nFrom Eq.(11) and Eq.(14) we compute for this system:\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n= 411.23 day and\n= 8067.0 day .\n(34)\n\u03c9\n\u03a9\nThe observational data do not fully cover the orbital period of the\nG-star around the binary's CM, but we will be nevertheless able\nto estimate it, since we are assuming a high level of precision in\nthe data.\nAccording to our model predictions (Sect. 3.5), the radial velocity of the G-star can be decomposed in three sinusoidal terms\n(Eq.24). One of large amplitude, K0 = 6.907 km/s, but varying\nslowly with period 2\u03c0/\u03a9, and the other two terms varying much\nfaster with periods (Eq.27)\n2\u03c0\n= 222.64 day and\nn1\n\n2\u03c0\n= 210.99 day ,\nn2\n\n(35)\n\nand small amplitudes (Eq.26)\n|K1 | = 0.89 m/s and |K2 | = 0.18 m/s .\n\n(36)\n\n5\n\nTable 2.

The mass determined by the fit is the\ntotal mass of the close binary system, M = M1 + M2 = 1.05 M\u2299 .\nIn Figure 4 we plot the radial velocity of the star superimposed on the binary CM orbit and also the velocity residuals after\nsubtracting these long term variations. The precision of the instrument is \u223c1 m/s, but the residuals, although very small, show\namplitude variations that can reach almost \u00b13 m/s. A trained observer can then suspect for the existence of something else in the\ndata. To check it in a simple way we perform a frequency analysis of the residuals (Fig.5). We can then see an important peak\naround 223 day, clearly indicating that something else is hidden\nin the data. We also plot a periodogram of the data, and since\nthere is no peak at the same frequency (there is only a small one\naround 364 day) we conclude that the signal is true.\n\na1 sin i\nf (m)\nm2 sin i\nm2 sin i\na\nrms\np\n\u03c72\n\n[unit]\n[km/s]\n[day]\n[deg]\n[m/s]\n[JD-2400000]\n[10\u22123 AU]\n[10\u22123 M\u2299 ]\n[M\u2295 ]\n[M\u2299 ]\n[AU]\n[m/s]\n\nplanet\nbinary CM\n10.021 \u00b1 0.037\n222.61 \u00b1 1.22\n8018.0 \u00b1 32.5\n0.0486 \u00b1 0.1725 0.0016 \u00b1 0.0002\n94.04 \u00b1 237.2\n280.35 \u00b1 34.93\n1.07 \u00b1 0.19\n6904.6 \u00b1 30.1\n53839.0 \u00b1 146.9 53471.9 \u00b1 778.0\n0.022\n2.8 \u00d7 10\u221211\n20.6\n6.2 \u00d7 10\u22125\n0.719\n\n5089\n273.5\n3.5 \u00d7 105\n1.046\n9.95\n\n0.56\n0.51\n\nErrors are given by the standard deviation \u03c3. The orbital period of the\nouter body is longer than the data acquired and thus we are unable to\ncomplete constrain its orbit. The eccentricity and the perihelium of the\ninner planet are also very badly constrained because we are at the limit\nof the instrument resolution. Despite all the uncertainties, the adjusted\nparameters for the planet agree with our model predictions (Sect. 3.5).\n\nWe then fit the radial velocities (Tab.2) using a model with\ntwo Keplerian orbits. It yields for the planetary companion P1 =\n222.6 day, e = 0.049 and a minimum mass of 20.6 M\u2295 , while\nfor the binary's CM we get approximately the same orbital parameters as before (Tab.3). Despite all the uncertainties in the\norbital parameters, the use of a second Keplerian orbit is a better\napproximation than the single Keplerian model, since the velocity residuals drop to rms = 0.56 m/s, below the precision of the\ninstrument (they were above 1 m/s before).\nIn Figure 6 we plot the phase-folded residual radial velocities\nwhen the contribution of the binary CM is subtracted. The data\nis superimposed on the orbital solution of the planetary companion, which really looks like a planet. The remaining O \u2212 C is below the precision of the instrument (\u223c1 m/s) and therefore we do\nnot find any additional signal in the data. This is confirmed when\nwe perform a frequency analysis of these residuals: no relevant\npeak is found, and there is no signal around P2 = 211 day, the\nperiod for which we expected to see the n2 frequency (Eq.35).\nBy comparing the numerical determination period of the\nplanet, P1 = 222.61 \u00b1 1.22 day (Tab.3) with its theoretical estimation P1 = 222.64 day (Eq.35), we see that our prediction\nwas correct. Results for the amplitude are not so good, but still\nexact since the numerical determination K1 = 1.07 \u00b1 0.19 m/s\n(Tab.3) includes within the error bar the theoretical estimation\nK1 = 0.89 m/s (Eq.36). A better numerical determination could\nbe achieved with identical instrumental precision, but using a\nlarger amount of data points. On the other hand, the amplitude\nK2 = 0.18 m/s (Eq.36) is lower than \u03c3K1 = 0.19 m/s (Tab.3), the\nerror bar of K1 , so there is no hope of determining it with the\npresent experience.\nFrom the numerical values of n1 and K1 we can infer the\norbital parameters of the planet, a p = 0.719 \u00b1 0.003 AU and\nM p = 20.6 \u00b1 3.7 M\u2295 , while the theoretical values were respectively a p = 0.719 AU (Eq.29) and M p = 17.3 M\u2295 (Eq.30). The\nmass is overestimated because the amplitude K1 was so.\nNow that we know that a binary can mimic a planet, whenever we suspect that a binary can be responsible for the observed\n\n\fM.H.M.

Different kinds of binary systems\n\n0\n\nNow that we have seen that our formulae are correct we will\napply them to a wide variety of binary systems' configurations.\nIn Table 4 we see the predictions of the model for several binary\nsystems around a star with M\u22c6 = M\u2299 . We chose only stable\nbinary systems with \u03b1 << 0.5 (see Eq.10).\nThe first and second examples are the cases studied in\nSchneider & Cabrera (2006): the star is being perturbed by close\nequal masses' binaries composed of stars with 1 M\u2299 . In Ex.#1,\nK1 is at the current resolution level (\u223c1 m/s) while K2 is 5 times\nsmaller. In this case we may be lead to believe that the star has a\nplanet companion with 1.4 Neptune masses. On the other hand,\nin Ex.#2 we should be able to detect both K1 and K2 ; hence in\nthis case we can conclude that the star's wobble is caused by a\nbinary and not a planet companion.\nThe third example is the case discussed in the previous section. Here we have a triple system composed of stars with different spectral types. As we saw previously, in this case we can\ndetect the peak with amplitude K1 , but not the one with amplitude K2 , and we are lead to believe that the star has a planet\ncompanion with about one Neptune mass.\nIn the fourth example the star is being perturbed by a close\nhierarchical binary composed of a star with 1 M\u2299 and another\nbody with 0.1 M\u2299 . We have K1 at the current resolution level\nwhile K2 is 5 times smaller. Again we are lead to believe that the\nstar has a planet companion with 1.4 Neptune masses.\nIn the next two examples the binaries are composed of a star\nwith 1 M\u2299 and a brown-dwarf with 10 M J (Ex.#5) or a planet\nwith 1 M J (Ex.#6). In these cases both peaks are currently undetectable (\u223c cm/s) but could be within reach of future observation\ncampaingns like CODEX (Pasquini et al. 2008).\nFinally, in the last two examples we have a 1 M\u2299 star and\na binary composed of two Jupiter-sized planets (Ex.#7) and a\nJupiter-sized planet and an Earth-sized \"satellite\" (Ex.#8). In\nboth cases, the inferred values for M p are too low for planets.\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-3\n0\n\nO-C [m/s]\n\nFrequencies\n2\u03c0/n1 2\u03c0/n2\n(day)\n(day)\n137.1 131.7\n265.6 246.0\n222.6 211.0\n363.7 333.3\n380.6 348.1\n382.5 349.7\n4.23\n4.13\n6.06\n5.86\n\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n-3\n53000\n\n53500\n\n0.2\n\n54000\n\n0.4\n\n54500\n\n0.6\n\n55000\n\n55500\n\n0.8\n\n56000\n\n1\n\n56500\n\n57000\n\nJD-2400000 [days]\n\nFig. 6.

The respective\nresiduals as a function of Julian Date are displayed in the lower\npanel. We see that the remaining O \u2212 C is below the precision of\nthe instrument (\u223c1 m/s) and therefore we do not expect to find\nany additional signal in the data.\nstellar wobble, we should also provide its parameters. From the\nvalues of n1 and \u03a9 (Tab.3) we can obtain (Eq.27)\n2\u03c0\n= 411.0 \u00b1 2.2 day and\n\u03c9\n\n2\u03c0\n= 8018 \u00b1 33 day ,\n\u03a9\n\n(37)\n\nwhich are in very good agreement with the true values (Eq.34).\nThe individual masses of the stars in the close binary can also be\nresolved as well as the semi-major axis. Directly from the fit we\nhave a = 9.95 \u00b1 0.03 AU and M = 1.046 \u00b1 0.005 M\u2299 (Tab.3).\nThen, using Eqs.(32) and (33) we can respectively obtain\nab = 1.098 \u00b1 0.006 AU\n\nand \u03bc = 0.275 \u00b1 0.062 M\u2299 .\n\n(38)\n\nBy comparing the above determinations with the true parameters chosen for this system (Ex.#3, Tab.4) we verify that\nthey match quite well. We thus conclude that a two-Keplerian\napproach of the stellar radial velocity is enough to determine\nthe parameters of the triple system, i.e., we can keep the current\nsoftware that is used to fit planets to the stellar data and do not\nneed to develop a specific algorithm for binaries. Of course this\nin only true if we keep a Keplerian approach, the use of a N-body\n\n5. Discussion and conclusion\nIn this paper we studied a triple system composed of a star which\nwe observe and a binary system. Our goal was to decide if the\neffect of the binary system on the star's center of mass motion\ncould be mistaken as a planet companion to it.\nPrevious work done by Schneider & Cabrera (2006) suggested that the effect of a star-star system could mimic the presence of a planet companion to the observed star. However, we\n\n\f8\n\nM.H.M. Morais and A.C.M. Correia: Stellar wobble caused by a binary system\n\nfound that this is not correct, since a more careful analysis of\nthe observational data should allow us to distinguish between\nthe two effects. Indeed, when there is a close binary system, the\nFourier spectrum of the star's radial velocity should exhibit not\none but two peaks located at nearby frequencies. This could also\nindicate the presence of two planets on close orbits, but since\nthese systems are most likely unstable we should be able to reject this hypothesis.\nNevertheless, we saw that it is sometimes possible to mistake\n(at least temporarily) the effect of a binary system by a planet.\nThis happens when the observations are near the resolution\nlimit so that we can identify the primary peak but not the secondary peak. However, even in this case our estimate for the fake\nplanet's mass differs from that obtained by Schneider & Cabrera\n(2006).\nIn this article we obtained tools for distinguishing between\nthe two effects: we estimate the parameters of the binary system\nthat could me mistaken by that planet and check if they are realistic. We recommend that, in future discoveries of planets around\nstars in binary systems, these formulas should be used in order\nto exclude the possibility of a false alarm.\nWe also wanted to evaluate the effect of different types of binary systems on the star's CM motion. In particular, we were interested in star-star, star-planet and planet-satellite systems. We\nsaw that the effect of a star-star system is only significant when\nthis is close to the observed star. For instance, a binary system of\ndwarf stars at 1 AU from each other and at the distance 10 AU\nfrom the observed star causes a wobble on the latter which would\nbe at the current resolution level. We also saw that the effect of\na star-planet system is currently undetectable although it is possibly within reach of future observation campaigns. Finally, we\nsaw that the effect of a planet-satellite system is insignificant and\nshould never be mistaken by a planet companion to the observed\nstar as the implied mass would simply be too low.\nOur conclusions were established for a triple system of bodies evolving in co-planar and circular orbits. However, it is\nknown that these kind of systems may present eccentric orbits\nand different mutual inclinations. The inclusion of these two effects may change some of the results presented here.\n\nAppendix A:\nWe re-write the equation of motion of the star M\u22c6 (Eq.19) using\nCartesian coordinates in the (\u0131\u0302, \uf6be\u0302) frame (see Fig. 1) such that\nr\u0302 = cos \u03b8 \u0131\u0302 + sin \u03b8 \uf6be\u0302 ,\n\u00fb = \u2212 sin \u03b8 \u0131\u0302 + cos \u03b8 \uf6be\u0302 ,\n\n(A.1)\n(A.2)\n\nwith\n\u03b8 = \u03b80 + \u03a9 t ,\nwhere \u03b80 is an initial phase (Fig.2).\nThus we obtain\n!\n\"\nGM\n3 \u03bc\n\u1e8c = \u2212 2\ncos \u03b8\n1 + \u03c12\n4 M\naA\n\n#\n9 2\u03bc\n3 2\u03bc\n+ \u03c1\ncos 2S cos \u03b8 + \u03c1\nsin 2S sin \u03b8 ,\n4 M\n2 M\n\"\n!\n3 \u03bc\nGM\n1 + \u03c12\nsin \u03b8\n\u0178 = \u2212 2\n4\nM\naA\n#\n9 2\u03bc\n3 2\u03bc\n+ \u03c1\ncos 2S sin \u03b8 \u2212 \u03c1\nsin 2S cos \u03b8 ,\n4 M\n2 M\n\n(A.3)\n\nwhere \u03c1 = ab /a \u226a 1.\nIn order to solve this set of differential equations we perform\nthe transformation of coordinates\n!\n!\n!\nX\u0304\nsin \u03b8 \u2212 cos \u03b8 X \u2212 a\u22c6 cos \u03b8\n,\n(A.6)\n=\nY \u2212 a\u22c6 sin \u03b8\ncos \u03b8 sin \u03b8\n\u0232\nwith\n!\nM\n3 2\u03bc\na\u22c6 =\na.\n1+ \u03c1\nM + M\u22c6\n4 M\n\n(A.7)\n\nThe set of differential equations becomes\nX\u0304 \u0308 \u2212 2\u03a9\u0232 \u0307 \u2212 \u03a92 X\u0304 = \u221212\u03c92 \u03b4 sin 2S ,\n\u0232 \u0308 + 2\u03a9X\u0304 \u0307 \u2212 \u03a92 \u0232 = \u221218\u03c92 \u03b4 cos 2S ,\n\n(A.8)\n(A.9)\n\nwith\n\u03b4=\n\n\u03bc \u0012 ab \u00134\na.\n8M a\n\n(A.10)\n\nThis admits the solution\nX\u0304 = \u03b4X sin 2S ,\n\u0232 = \u03b4Y cos 2S ,\n\n(A.11)\n(A.12)\n\nwhere\n\u2212 4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03a9)2 \u03b4X + 4\u03a9(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03a9)\u03b4Y \u2212 \u03a92 \u03b4X = \u221212\u03c92 \u03b4 ,\n\u22124(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03a9)2 \u03b4Y + 4\u03a9(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03a9)\u03b4X \u2212 \u03a92 \u03b4Y = \u221218\u03c92 \u03b4 .\n\n(A.13)\n(A.14)\n\nThe solution to Eqs.
