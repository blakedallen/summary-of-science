XX.XX.XX No PACS code given\n\n1 Introduction\nIf dark matter (DM) is created thermally during the\nBig Bang the present relic density is inversely proportional to h\u03c3vi, the annihilation cross section \u03c3 of\nDM particles, usually called WIMPS (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles), times their relative velocity. The average is taken over these velocities. This inverse proportionality is obvious, if one considers that\na higher annihilation rate, given by h\u03c3vin\u03c7 , would\nhave reduced the relic density before freeze-out, i.e. the\ntime, when the expansion rate of the Universe, given\nby the Hubble constant, became equal to or larger\nthan the annihilation rate. For the present value of\n\u03a9h2 = 0.105 \u00b1 0.008, as measured by WMAP [1], the\nthermally averaged total cross section at the freezeout temperature of m\u03c7 /22 must have been around\n3 * 10\u221226 cm3 s\u22121 [2]. If the s-wave annihilation is dominant, as expected in many supersymmetric models,\nthen the annihilation cross section is energy independent, i.e. the cross section given above is also valid\nfor the cold temperatures of the present universe [5].\nSuch a large cross section will lead to a production\nrate of mono-energetic quarks1 in our Galaxy, which\na\n\nEmail: wim.de.boer@cern.ch\nThe quarks are mono-energetic, since the kinetic energy\nof the cold dark matter particles is expected to be negligible\nwith the mass of the particles, so the energy of the quarks\nequals the mass of the WIMP.\n1\n\nis 40 orders of magnitude above the rate produced at\nany accelerator. The fragmentation of these quarks will\nlead to a large flux of gamma rays with a characteristic\nenergy spectrum quite different from the background\nof cosmic ray interactions with the interstellar material of the Galaxy. In addition, gamma rays have the\nadvantage that they point back to the source and do\nnot suffer energy losses, so they are the ideal candidates to trace the dark matter density. The charged\ncomponents interact with Galactic matter and are deflected by the Galactic magnetic fields, so they do\nnot point back to the source. Therefore the charged\nparticle fluxes have large uncertainties from the propagation models, which determine how many of the\nproduced particles arrive at the detector. For gamma\nrays the propagation is straightforward: only the ones\npointing towards the detector will be observed.\nAn excess of diffuse gamma rays compatible with\ndark matter annihilation (DMA) has indeed been observed by the EGRET telescope on board of NASA's\nCGRO (Compton Gamma Ray Observatory)[4]. The\nexcess was observed in all sky directions, which would\nimply that DM is not dark anymore, but shining in\ngamma rays. Of course, such an important observation needs to be scrutinized heavily. Before discussing\nthe criticism the evidence and new confirmation from\nN-body simulations and the gas flaring is presented in\nthe next section.\n\n\f-1\n\nE * flux [GeV cm s sr ]\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\nDark Matter\nPion decay\nInverse Compton\nBremsstrahlung\n\nEGRET\nbackground\nsignal\nmWIMP=50-70 GeV\n\n-4\n\n2\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n2\n\nE [GeV]\n\nFig. 1. Fit of the shapes of background and DMA signal\nto the EGRET data in the direction of the Galactic centre\nThe light shaded (yellow) area indicates the background using the shapes known from accelerator experiments, while\nthe dark shaded (red) area corresponds to the signal contribution from DMA for a 60 GeV WIMP mass. The intermediate (blue) shaded area corresponds to a variation of\nthe WIMP mass between 50 and 70 GeV.\n\n2 The DMA interpretation of the EGRET\nexcess of diffuse Galactic gamma rays\nThe EGRET excess on diffuse gamma rays was first\nobserved by Hunter et al. in 1997 [3]. Below 1 GeV\nthe CR interactions describe the data perfectly well,\nbut above 1 GeV the data are up to a factor two above\nthe expected background. The excess shows all the features of DMA annihilation for a WIMP mass between\n50 and 70 GeV [4]. Especially, the two basic constraints\nexpected from any indirect DMA signal are fulfilled:\n(i) the excess should have the same spectral shape in\nall sky directions. (ii) the excess should be observable\nin a large fraction of the sky with an intensity distribution corresponding to the gravitational potential of\nour Galaxy. The latter means that one should be able\nto relate the distribution of the excess to the rotation\ncurve. Both conditions, which form a formidable constraint, are met by the EGRET data [4]. In addition,\nthe results are perfectly consistent with the expectations from Supersymmetry[5,6].\nThe analysis of the EGRET data is simplified by\nthe fact that the spectral shapes of the DMA contribution and the background from CR interactions\nwith the gas of the disk are well known from accelerator experiments: (i) the DMA signal should have the\ngamma ray spectrum from the fragmentation of monoenergetic quarks, which has been studied in great detail at LEP. (ii) the background in the energy range of\ninterest is dominated by cosmic ray (CR) protons hitting the hydrogen of the disk. Therefore the dominant\nbackground spectral shape is known from fixed-target\nexperiments. Given that these shapes are known from\nthe two best studied reactions in accelerator experiments allows to fit these known shapes to the observed\n\nFig. 2. Results of an N-body simulation of the tidal disruption of the Canis Major dwarf Galaxy, whose orbit was\nfitted to the observed stars (red points).

From [14].\n\ngamma ray spectrum in a given sky direction and obtain from the fitted normalization constants the contribution of both, background and annihilation signal.\nSo in this case one does not need propagation models to estimate the background, since the data itself\ncalibrates the amount of background. In addition, fitting the shapes eliminates the uncertainties from the\noverall normalization error in the data and only the\nreduced point-to-point errors have to be taken into account. A typical gamma ray energy spectrum is shown\nin Fig. 1, which clearly shows the rather distinct spectral shapes for DMA and background, so the two normalization constants of DMA and background are not\nstrongly correlated. The blue area corresponds to the\ndifference in WIMP mass between 50 and 70 GeV. The\nlatter gives already a considerably worse fit, since the\ntotal flux is too low near the maximum and too high\nfor the highest bin, so the range 50-70 GeV is the preferred WIMP mass. The DM halo, as determined from\nthe dark matter normalization factors in 180 independent sky directions, shows doughnut-like structures at\n4 and 13 kpc [4]. More details can be found in the\ncontribution to these proceedings[7]. The ring at 4 kpc\n(inner ring) coincides with the ring of dust in this region. The dust is presumably kept there because of a\ngravitational potential well, which is provided by the\nring of DM. The ring at 13 kpc (outer ring) is thought\nto originate from the tidal disruption of the Canis Major dwarf galaxy, which circles the Galaxy in an almost\ncircular orbit coplanar with the disk [8,9]. Three independent observations confirm this picture of the ring\noriginating from the tidal disruption of a dwarf galaxy:\n(i)a ring of DM is expected in this region from the\nobserved ring of stars, called Monoceros ring, which\n\n\frot. velocity [km s-1]\n\n500\n\ntotal\nluminous disk\nbulge\n\n400\n\ndm\ntriax halo\ninner ring\nouter ring\n\nno ring\n\n300\n\n200\n\nwith ring\n\n100\n\n0\n\n-100\n\n0\n\n2.5\n\n5\n\nFig. 4.

The rotation curve with the contributions of the\nbulge, the disk, the triaxial dark matter halo and the\ntwo ringlike structures. The outer ring causes the peculiar change of slope in the rotation curve at about 11 kpc.\nFrom [4].\n\nwas discovered first with SDSS data [10,11]. Follow-up\nobservations [12] found that this structure surrounds\nthe Galactic disk as a giant ring (observed over 100\ndegrees in latitude) at Galactocentric distances from\n8 kpc to 20 kpc. Tracing this structure with 2MASS\nM giant stars, [13] suggested that this structure might\nresult from the tidal disruption of a merging dwarf\ngalaxy. N-body simulations show indeed that the overdensity in Canis Major is indeed a perfect progenitor\nfor the Monoceros stream and they predict a DM ring\nat 13 kpc with a low ellipticity and almost coplanar\nwith the disk, as shown in Fig. 2 (from Ref. [14]). The\norientation of the major axis at an angle of 20 degrees\nwith respect to the axis sun-Galactic centre and the\nratio of minor to major axis around 0.8 agree with the\nEGRET ring parameters given in Ref. [4]. This correlation with the EGRET excess lends both support to the\nDMA interpretation of the EGRET excess, the connection between the Monoceros stream and the Canis\nMajor dwarf galaxy and its outer galactic origin. The\noverdensity of stars forming the Canis Major dwarf is\nsometimes defended as being a warp of the Galactic\ndisk (see discussions e.g. in [15]).\n(ii) Such a massive ring structure influences the rotation curve in a peculiar way: it decreases the rotation\ncurve at radii inside the ring and increases it outside.\nThis is apparent from the change in direction of the\ngravitational force from the ring on a tracer, since this\nforce decreases the force from the galactic centre for a\ntracer inside the ring, but increases it outside the ring.\nThis is indeed observed as shown in Fig. 3, where the\n\nnegative contribution of the outer ring is clearly visible.\n(iii) A direct proof of the large amount of DM mass\nin the outer ring comes from a recent analysis of the\ngas flaring in our Galaxy [16]. Using the new data of\nthe LAB survey of the 21 cm line in our Galaxy led\nto a precise measurement of the gas layer thickness up\nto radii of 40 kpc. The increase of the half width of\nthe layer after a decrease to half its maximum value\n(HWHM) as function of distance is governed by the decrease in gravitational potential of the disk. The outer\nring increases the gravitational potential above 10 kpc,\nwhich is expected to reduce the gas flaring. Only after\ntaking the ring like structure into account the reduced\ngas flaring in this region could be understood. The\neffect is shown in Fig. 4. A fit averaged over all longitudes requires a DM ring with a mass of 2.1010 solar\nmasses, in rough agreement with the EGRET excess.\nClearly, these three independent astronomical observations need a ringlike DM structure above 10 kpc,\nthus providing independent evidence for the DMA interpretation of the EGRET excess.\n\n3 Alternatives to the DMA interpretation\nof the EGRET excess and criticism\nAlternative models for the EGRET excess without DM\nhave to assume that the locally measured fluxes of protons and electrons are not representative for our galaxy\n[17]. In this case the cosmic ray spectrum of protons\nand electrons is not taken to be the locally observed\none, but modified to increase the gamma ray spectrum\nat high energies. This requires a strong break in the\ninjection spectrum of electrons and protons in order\nnot to change the gamma ray spectrum below 1 GeV,\nbut only above 1 GeV. Such a change in the shape of\nthe spectrum is unexpected, since the fast diffusion as\ncompared to the energy loss time equalizes the spec-\n\n\ftrum everywhere in the Galaxy, in agreement with the\nfact that the spectrum in all directions is observed to\nbe the same.\nAnother explanation is provided by tuning the efficiency of the EGRET spectrometer to simulate DMA\n[18]. However, this requires the efficiency already to\nbe modified around 1 GeV and reaching a change in\nefficiency of 100% at 10 GeV in clear disagreement\nwith the calibration error in a photon beam before\nlaunch[19] and the residual uncertainties below 20%\nduring the flight after correcting for time dependent\neffects[20]. Although there is some uncertainty in the\nefficiency of the veto counter at higher energies because of the backsplash from the calorimeter, this effect should not start at 1 GeV. Even if the errors are\nlarger than estimated, it would be a remarkable coincidence that the excess corresponds exactly to the\nvery specific sharply falling spectrum from the fragmentation of mono-energetic quarks! Furthermore, if\none only fits the shape of the gamma ray spectrum\nall common normalization errors cancel, so one is only\nsensitive to the relative point-to-point errors in the\ndata, which are considerably smaller.\nAmong the most important criticism was a paper\nby [21] claiming that the antiproton flux from DMA,\nusing the DM distribution from the EGRET excess,\nwould be an order of magnitude higher than the observed antiproton flux. They used a simple propagation model assuming the propagation of charged particles to be the same in the halo and the disk. Such\ncommon propagation models describe all present data,\nbut this is no guarantee that they represent the truth,\nsince the data is observed locally and inferring the\npropagation in the whole Galaxy from local data does\nnot have a unique solution. E.g. Galactic wind models\nhave anisotropic propagation, not only because of the\nconvection, but also because the diffusion in the halo\nis expected to be much faster than in the disk [22].\nSuch an anisotropic diffusion model leads to a strong\nreduction of the antiproton flux from DMA, since the\nantiprotons are preferentially produced in the halo and\nstay there or move to outer space instead of diffusing\nrandomly. Therefore, instead of rejecting the DMA interpretation of the EGRET excess by models based\non isotropic diffusion without regular magnetic fields,\nDMA can be used as an opportunity to construct an\nanisotropic propagation model. It is shown in a separate contribution to this conference that such a model\ncan simultaneously describe the EGRET excess, the\nantiproton flux and the production of secondaries, if\nDMA is introduced as a source term in the model [23].\nIn summary, the gamma rays play a very special\nrole for indirect DM detection, since they point back\nto the source. Therefore the gamma rays provide a\nperfect means to reconstruct the dark matter halo by\nobserving the intensity of the gamma ray emissions\nin the various sky directions. The halo profile can in\nturn be used to calculate the shape of the rotation\ncurve. Fitting the background and DMA shapes to the\ndata in 180 independent sky directions reveals indeed\na WIMP mass around 60 GeV in all sky directions\nand a halo profile with substructure consistent with\nthe rotation curve, N-body simulations and the gas\n\nflaring. For the halo profile one is only interested in the\nrelative contributions in the various sky directions, so\nhere all experimental errors largely cancel, since the\nEGRET satellite does not care in which direction it\nmeasures.\nTherefore we consider DMA is a viable explanation\nof the EGRET excess of diffuse Galactic gamma rays,\nespecially since it is observed with the same shape of\nthe fragmentation of mono-energetic quarks in all sky\ndirections and the intensity distribution of the excess\ntraces the DM profile, as shown independently by the\nrotation curve, the gas flaring and the N-body simulation of the disruption of the Canis-Major satellite\ngalaxy.\nThis work was supported by the DLR (Deutsches\nZentrum f\u00fcr Luft- und Raumfahrt) and a grant from\nthe DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant 436\nRUS 113/626/0-1).\n\nReferences\n1.
