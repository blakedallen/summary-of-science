Novel correlation structures\nover large pseudorapidity interval \u2206y were observed in azimuthal correlations\nfor the intermediate particle transverse momenta pT \u2248 1 \u2212 5 GeV/c [2, 3].\n1\n\nTalk given at the The Sixth Workshop on Particle Correlations and Femtoscopy\n(WPCF2010), Kiev, September 14 - 18, 2010.\n\n1\n\n\fFirst the striking \"ridge\" events were revealed in studies of the near-side\nspectrum of correlated pairs of hadrons by the STAR collaboration [4]. The\nspectrum of correlated pairs on the near side (defined by the trigger particle\ndirection) extends across the entire detector acceptance in pseudorapidity\ninterval of order \u2206\u03b7 \u223c 2 units and is strongly collimated for azimuthal angles.\nHere \u2206\u03b7 is the difference in pseudo-rapidity \u03b7 = \u2212 ln (tan (\u03b8/2)), where \u03b8 is\nthe polar angle relative to the beam axis, between two particles and \u2206\u03c6\nis the difference in their azimuthal angle \u03c6 (in radians). The analyzes of\nmeasurements by the PHENIX [5] and PHOBOS [6] collaborations confirmed\nthe STAR results.\nThe discovery of the ridge has aggravated quantitative theoretical analyzes which propose rather different explanations [7, 8, 9]. The first, [7] treats\nthe ridge as an initial-state effect. The authors point out that the enhanced\ntwo-particle correlations are a natural consequence of the correlations in the\nclassical color fields responsible for multi-particle production in relativistic\nheavy-ion collisions. Due to fluctuations of color charges in colliding nuclei\nthe longitudinally boost-invariant and transversally inhomogeneous structure\nof the matter can be formed. When it expends hydrodynamically it could\nlead to the ridges [8]. The others explore a final-state effect as the origin\nof the ridge [9].The evolution of the system and other later-stage effects can\nmodify these correlations, which, in fact, are associated with fluctuations in\nthe energy densities at the final stage. The recent measurements by the CMS\nCollaboration [10] observed unexpected effect in proton-proton collisions at\nthe LHC. The clear and significant \"ridge\"-structure emerges at \u2206\u03c6 \u2248 0 extending to |\u2206\u03b7| of at least 4 units. This novel feature of the data has never\nbeen seen in two-particle correlation functions in pp or pp\u0304 collisions before.\nThis unusually elongate structure the ridge -remains after removal of elliptic\nflow and ordinary jet correlations [11]. This is faced with the problem of\ncausality which, probably can be solved only if one supposes that the ridge\nphenomenon in relativistic A+A collisions is rooted in the initial conditions\nof the thermal evolution of the system. The aim of this study is to check\nthis hypothesis by an analysis of the developing energy density in the system\nwhich at very initial stage of collisions has transversally bumping tube-like\nfluctuations with boost-invariant homogeneous structure within some spacerapidity region.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nCalculation of energy density distributions\n\nThe numerical results presented in this section were obtained on the basis\nof original 3D ideal hydro-code, described in details in [12]. The analysis is\nbased on hydrodynamic approach to A+A collisions and considered within\nthe Boltzmann equations. It is consistent with conservations laws and accounts for the opacity effects. The hydrodynamic evolution starts at the\ntime \u03c40 . We use Bjorken-type initial conditions at \u03c40 : boost-invariance of\nthe system in longitudinal direction, initial longitudinal flow vL = z/t without transverse collective expansion. In present calculation we compare the\ntransverse-velocity profile of hydrodynamic flow and energy density profile\nwhich evolve in time till the chemical freeze-out (T = 165 MeV) in different\ninitial scenarios. The one of them corresponds to the smooth Gaussian profile with radius R and energy density as it was considered in [13] at \u03c40 = 0.2\nfm/c. The other scenarios are based on transversally bumping tube-like initial conditions at \u03c40 . These tubes are rather thin transversally and relatively\nlong in the direction of beam axis; with radii ai = 1 fm. The general energy\ndensity distribution at \u03c40 could be written as:\n\n\u2212x\n\nE = Eb e\n\n2 +y 2\nR2\n\n+\n\nNt\nX\n\n\u2212\n\nEi e\n\n(x\u2212xi )2 +(y\u2212yi )2\na2\ni\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\ni=0\n\nRi = x2i = yi2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Eb is the maximum of average energy density distribution, Ei are\nthe maxima of tube-like fluctuations, Ri are the positions of the fluctuation\nlocations and Nt is the number of tubes. Instead of a study of the result\nover very many fluctuations, that should be finally averaged over azimuthal\nangular (it brings symmetry), we will be based here on the possible typical,\nor representative, initial fluctuation which are already maximally symmetric\nin azimuthal plane. The following initial configurations are considered:\ni The configuration without fluctuation: distribution of initial energy\ndensity corresponds to the Gauss distribution with R = 5.4 fm and\nmaximum energy density at r = 0 is Eb = 90 GeV/fm3 ;\nii The configuration with one tube (fluctuation) in the center: energy\ndensity profile is the Gauss distribution with a = 1.0 fm and the maxima\nvalue 270 GeV/fm3 ;\n3\n\n\fiii The configuration with one tube (fluctuation) shifted from the center:\nEb = 90 Gev/fm3 ; R = 5.4 fm; E0 = 270 GeV/fm3 ; R0 = 3 fm; a0 = 1\nfm; The results of calculations are presented for initial time and for \u03c4\n= 1, 2, 10 fm/c ;\niv The configuration with four tubes (fluctuations): Eb = 85 GeV/fm3 ; R\n= 5.4 fm; Ei = 250 GeV/fm3 ; Ri = 5.6 fm; ai = 1 fm; The evolution of\nenergy density profiles is presented on the Fig. 1;\n\nFigure 1: 3D plots of energy density profiles with 4 tube-like initial conditions\nfor \u03c4 = 0.2, 1, 2, 3, 6 and 10 fm/c\n\n4\n\n\fv The configuration with ten tubes (fluctuations): Eb = 25 GeV/fm3 ; R\n= 5.4 fm; R0 = 0 fm; Ri (i \u2264 3) = 2,8 fm; Ri (i > 3) = 4.7 fm; ai = 1\nfm; Ei = 4Eb exp(\u2212Ri2 /R2 ) .\nFor all the considered cases the traces of the initial fluctuations - bumping final energy distributions - remain after the system evolution that should\nlead to a non-trivial structure in observed correlations. Besides the energy\ndensity profiles the evolution of transverse velocity profiles of hydrodynamic\nflow in different scenarios also was considered. The fluctuations of the initial\nconditions result in the fluctuation of the transverse velocity in the system.\nAt the supposed thermalization time \u03c4 = 1 fm/c the corresponding fluctuations in the transverse velocity averaged over azimuthal angular and radius\nare approximately 30 % between the cases when the high density fluctuation\npeak is just in the center and when it is shifted while at the later times\n(\u03c4 = 10 fm/c) it is only 2-3 % . This may lead to the important conclusions as for small fluctuations of the mean transverse momenta of observed\nparticles, despite big fluctuations of transverse velocities at thermalization\ntime.\n\n3\n\nConclusions\n\nThe basic hydrokinetic code, proposed in [12] was modified to include the\ntube-like initial conditions with the aim to study how the initial correlations\nin the energy density evolve with time. We found that the effect of the\nfluctuations of the initial conditions does not wash out during the system\nexpansion that, probably, leads to the ridges structures of the correlations,\nwhich are caused by these fluctuations. The evolution of the energy density\ndistributions and velocity profiles are calculated in the framework of the\n3D hydrodynamics. Possible physically grounded configurations of initial\ndensity profiles are proposed. The first spectra calculations were done in the\nframeworks of the hydrokinetic model (HKM) [12, 14] which allows describing\nall the stages of the system evolution as well as a formation of the particle\nmomentum at the decoupling stage. The further investigations on this matter\nand description of correlations could be done in frames of this approach.\n\n4\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nYu.S. gives thanks to P.
