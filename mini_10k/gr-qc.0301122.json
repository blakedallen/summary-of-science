Possible implications of this result to the area spectrum of quantum\nblack holes are discussed.\n\ntheory of gravity.\nTo understand the original argument it is useful to recall that in the early development of quantum mechanics,\nBohr suggested a correspondence between classical and\nquantum properties of the Hydrogen atom, namely that\n\"transition frequencies at large quantum numbers should\nequal classical oscillation frequencies\". The black hole is\nin many senses the \"Hydrogen atom\" of General relativity. I therefore suggested [20] a similar usage of the discrete set of black-hole frequencies in order to shed some\nlight on the quantum properties of a black hole. However,\nthere is one important difference between the Hydrogen\natom and a black hole: while a (classical) atom emits\nradiation spontaneously according to the (classical) laws\nof electrodynamics, a classical black hole does not emit\nradiation. This crucial difference hints that one should\nlook for the highly damped black-hole free oscillations\n[let \u03c9 =Re\u03c9 + iIm\u03c9, then \u03c4 \u2261 (Im\u03c9)\u22121 is the effective\nrelaxation time for the black hole to return to a quiescent\nstate after emitting gravitational radiation. Hence, the\nrelaxation time \u03c4 \u2192 0 as Im\u03c9 \u2192 \u221e, implying no radiation emission, as should be the case for a classical black\nhole].\nLeaver [9] was the first to address to problem of computing the black hole highly damped ringing frequencies.\nNollert [21] found numerically that the asymptotic behavior of the ringing frequencies of a Schwarzschild black\nhole is given by (we normalize G = c = 2M = 1)\n\u0012\n\u0013\ni\n1\n\u03c9n = 0.0874247 +\nn+\n,\n(1)\n2\n2\n\nGravitational waves emitted by a perturbed black hole\nare dominated by 'quasinormal ringing', damped oscillations with a discrete spectrum [1]. At late times, all\nperturbations are radiated away in a manner reminiscent of the last pure dying tones of a ringing bell [2\u20135].\nThe quasinormal mode frequencies (ringing frequencies)\nare the characteristic 'sound' of the black hole itself, depending on its parameters (mass, charge, and angular\nmomentum).\nThe free oscillations of a black hole are governed by\nthe well-known Regge-Wheeler equation [6] in the case of\na Schwarzschild black hole, and by the Teukolsky equation [7] for the (rotating) Kerr black hole. The black\nhole QNM correspond to solutions of the wave equations\nwith the physical boundary conditions of purely outgoing waves at spatial infinity and purely ingoing waves\ncrossing the event horizon [8]. Such boundary conditions\nsingle out discrete solutions \u03c9 (assuming a time dependence of the form ei\u03c9t ).\nThe ringing frequencies are located in the complex frequency plane characterized by Im\u03c9 > 0. It turns out that\nfor a given angular harmonic index l there exist an infinite\nnumber of quasinormal modes, for n = 0, 1, 2, . . ., characterizing oscillations with decreasing relaxation times\n(increasing imaginary part) [9,10]. On the other hand,\nthe real part of the frequencies approaches an asymptotic\nconstant value.\nThe QNM frequencies, being a signature of the blackhole spacetime are of great importance from the astrophysical point of view. They allow a direct way of identifying the spacetime parameters (especially, the mass and\nangular momentum of the central black hole). This has\nmotivated a flurry of activity with the aim of computing\nthe spectrum of oscillations (see e.g., [1] for a detailed\nreview).\nRecently, the quasinormal frequencies of black holes\nhave acquired a different importance [11\u201317] in the context of Loop Quantum Gravity, a viable approach to the\nquantization of General Relativity (see e.g., [18,19] and\nreferences therein). These recent studies are motivated\nby an earlier work of Hod [20]. Few years ago I proposed\nto use Bohr's correspondence principle in order to determine the value of the fundamental area unit in a quantum\n\nas n \u2192 \u221e [22]. The asymptotic behavior Eq. (1) was\nlater verified by Andersson [23] using an independent\nanalysis. In Ref. [20] I realized that the asymptotic real\npart of the frequencies equals ln 3/8\u03c0, and proposed a\nheuristic picture (based on thermodynamic and statistical physics arguments) trying to explain this fact. Most\nrecently, Motl [13] has given an analytical proof for this\nconjecture.\nUsing the relation A = 16\u03c0M 2 for the surface area of\na Schwarzschild black hole, and \u2206M = E = h\u0304\u03c9 one finds\n\u2206A = 4l2P ln 3 with the emission/absorption of a quantum, where lP is the Planck length. Thus, we concluded\n1\n\n\fof the numerical complexity of the problem. Onozawa\n[31] computed the first nine frequencies of the Kerr black\nhole. It is of great interest to compare the conjectured\nasymptotic behavior given by Eq. (4) with the results of\ndirect numerical computations.\nFigure 1 displays Re\u03c9 for the Kerr black hole, as computed numerically in [31], and compare it with the analytically conjectured formula Eq. (4) [32]. We find that\nthe predicted results agree with the numerically computed ones to within \u223c 5%.\n\nthat the area spectrum of the quantum Schwarzschild\nblack hole is given by\nAn = 4l2P ln 3 * n\n\n;\n\nn = 1, 2, . . . .\n\n(2)\n\nThis result is remarkable from a statistical physics\npoint of view.\nIt does not relay in any way on\nthe well known thermodynamic relation between blackhole surface area and entropy SBH = 41 A [24]. In\nthe spirit of Boltzmann-Einstein formula in statistical\nphysics, Mukhanov and Bekenstein [25\u201327] relate gn \u2261\nexp[SBH (n)] to the number of microstates of the black\nhole that correspond to a particular external macrostate.\nIn other words, gn is the degeneracy of the nth area\neigenvalue. The accepted thermodynamic relation between black-hole surface area and entropy [24], combined\nwith the requirement that gn has to be an integer for every n, actually enforce a factor of the form 4 ln k (with\nk = 2, 3, . . .) in Eq. (2). We have shown that the value\nk = 3 is the only one compatible both with the areaentropy thermodynamic relation for black hole, and with\nBohr's correspondence principle as well.\nBekenstein [24,27,28] (see also [20,29] and references\ntherein) has given evidence for the existence of a universal (i.e., independent of the black-hole parameters: mass,\ncharge, and angular momentum) area spacing for quantum black holes. This, combined with the universality\nof the black-hole entropy (i.e., its direct thermodynamic\nrelation to the black-hole surface area) suggest that the\narea spectrum Eq. (2) should be valid for rotating black\nholes as well. In fact, our analysis leads to a natural conjecture for the asymptotic behavior of the highly damped\nquasinormal frequencies of a generic (rotating) Kerr black\nhole. First, we use the first law of black-hole thermodynamics\n\u2206M = TBH \u2206S + \u03a9\u2206J ,\n\nRe\u03c9\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\nrotation parameter a\n\nFIG. 1. Real part of the Kerr black hole QNM frequencies\nas a function of the black hole rotation parameter a. The numerical results are for gravitational quasinormal modes with\nl = m = 2. The predicted values (solid line) agree with the\nnumerically computed ones (dashed line) to within \u223c 5%.\n\nNote that the imaginary parts of the asymptotic QNM\nfrequencies are equally spaced in the Schwarzschild case\n[see Eq. (1)], with a spacing of 1/4M = 2\u03c0TBH . In order\nto check if this relation holds true for (generic) Kerr black\nholes as well, we display in Fig. 2 the spacing \u2206(Im\u03c9)\nusing the numerical data of [31], and compare it with a\npredicted value of 2\u03c0TBH . For a > 0.1, we find that the\nnumerically computed values agree with the predicted\nones to within \u223c 7%.\nIn summary, based on Bohr's correspondence principle\nwe have conjectured a simple formula for the asymptotic\nQNM frequencies of a generic (rotating) Kerr black hole.\nWe find a good agreement between the theoretically predicted frequencies and the numerically computed ones.\nThis agreement lands support for the validity of the area\nspectrum Eq. (2).\n\n(3)\n\nwhere TBH = (r+ \u2212 r\u2212 )/A is the Bekenstein-Hawking\ntemperature, and \u03a9 = 4\u03c0a/A is the angular velocity of\nthe black-hole horizon [r\u00b1 = M \u00b1 (M 2 \u2212 a2 )1/2 are the\nblack hole (event and inner) horizons, and a = J/M is\nthe black hole angular momentum per unit mass]. Taking\ncognizance of Eqs. (2) and (3) [together with the relation\nS = 41 A], one finds\nRe\u03c9 \u2192 TBH ln 3 + \u03a9m ,\n\npredicted\nnumerical\n\n1.2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere m is the azimuthal eigenvalue of the oscillation.\nThe corresponding problem of the Hydrogen atom in\nquantum mechanics hints that the formula should be\nvalid in the l = m case.\nIt should be emphasized that the asymptotic behavior\nof the black hole ringing frequencies is known only for the\nsimplest case of a Schwarzschild black hole. Less is known\nabout the corresponding QNM spectrum of the (rotating)\nKerr black hole [9,30,31]. This is a direct consequence\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nI thank a support by the Dr. Robert G.

This is a crucial feature, which is consistent with the\ninterpretation of the highly damped ringing frequencies\n(in the n \u226b 1 limit) as characteristics of the black hole\nitself.\nN.

Thus, one\nshould not necessarily go to the n \u226b 1 limit in order to\nobtain a fairly good estimate of the asymptotic behavior.\n\n\f"}
