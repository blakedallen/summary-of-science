We also provide general bounds on the (asymmetric) window size of the cutoff, and indicate links to classical extreme\nvalue theory.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt is well known that a large number of Markov chains exhibit cutoff phenomena\nwhen converging to stationarity. This phenomenon occurs when the distance\nof the chain from equilibrium (measured using, for example, the total-variation\nmetric or separation distance) stays close to its maximum value for some time,\nbefore dropping relatively fast and tending quickly to zero. Such behaviour was\nfirst identified for the transposition shuffle on the symmetric group [9], and has\nsince been shown to hold for many natural sequences of random walks on groups\n(see [14] for a review).\nIn a recent paper [2], Barrera et al. consider n-tuples of independent processes, and give sufficient conditions for cutoffs to hold when distance from\nstationarity is measured using total-variation, Hellinger, chi-square and Kullback distances, under the assumption that each coordinate process converges\nexponentially fast. In the particular case when all coordinates converge at the\nsame rate, the window size of the cutoff (to be defined below) is also determined.\nIn this paper we consider the separation distance of such n-tuples from stationarity and give conditions (very similar to those in [2]) guaranteeing the\nexistence of a separation cutoff. Our approach is slightly different from that of\nBarrera et al., however: instead of working with a set of ordered exponential\nrates we choose to work with discrete probability measures. This enables us\n1\n\n\fto relate cutoff to convergence of (suitably scaled versions of) these measures.\nFurthermore, we are able to provide general bounds on the window size of the\ncutoff (not only when all coordinates converge at the same rate). In particular,\nwe show that in general the right-hand side of the cutoff window may be of\nsignificantly larger order than the left.\nThe paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we recall the definitions of\ntotal-variation and separation distance, and make formal the notion of cutoff\ntime and window size. In Section 3 we present our main result concerning the\nexistence of a separation cutoff, and prove general bounds on the window-size of\nsuch a cutoff. We then apply this to the example of a continuous-time random\nwalk on the hypercube Zn2 , where each coordinate may move at a different rate,\nand present a specific case which shows that our general window-size bounds are\ntight. Some links to classical extreme value theory are also highlighted. Finally,\nin Section 4, we briefly consider the notion of a coupling cutoff for two such\nn-tuples.\n\n2\n\nThe cutoff phenomenon\n\nIn keeping with the notation of [8], for two probability measures \u03bc and \u03bd on a\nfinite space (E, E) we shall write D(\u03bc, \u03bd) for a general notion of distance between\nthem. One example is total-variation distance\nD(\u03bc, \u03bd) = k\u03bc \u2212 \u03bdkTV = sup |\u03bc(A) \u2212 \u03bd(A)| ,\nA\u2208E\n\nwhile the separation distance is defined to be\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u03bc(x)\nD(\u03bc, \u03bd) = sep (\u03bc, \u03bd) = max 1 \u2212\n.\nx\u2208E\n\u03bd(x)\nNote that separation is not a metric due to its asymmetry. Both of these\ndistances take values in [0, 1], and it is simple to show [1] that\nk\u03bc \u2212 \u03bdkTV \u2264 sep (\u03bc, \u03bd) .\nSeparation distance is intimately linked with the notion of strong stationary\ntimes. Let X be a Markov chain with time-t distribution P t and stationary\ndistribution \u03c0.\nDefinition 2.1. A strong stationary time (SST) T is a randomized stopping\ntime for X such that\nP(Xt = k | T \u2264 t) = \u03c0(k) ,\n\nfor all 0 \u2264 t < \u221e, k \u2208 E.\n\nIf T is a SST for X, then [1]\nsep (P t , \u03c0) \u2264 P(T > t) ,\n2\n\nfor all t \u2265 0.\n\n(2.1)\n\n\fAn optimal SST is one which achieves equality in (2.1) for all t \u2265 0: existence\nis demonstrated in [1] (in discrete-time).\nWe may now define the notion of a cutoff phenomenon for a given distance\nfunction D (including, but not restricted to, those distances defined above).\nDefinition 2.2. For n \u2265 1, let Xn be a stochastic process taking values on a\nfinite space (En , En ), with time-t distribution Pnt and stationary distribution \u03c0n .\nWe say that the sequence {En , Xn , \u03c0n ; n = 1, 2, . . . } exhibits a (\u03c4n , bn )-D-cutoff\nif \u03c4n , bn > 0 satisfy bn = o(\u03c4n ) and\nd\u2212 (c) = lim inf D(Pn\u03c4n +cbn , \u03c0n ) satisfies lim d\u2212 (c) = 1 ,\nc\u2192\u2212\u221e\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nd+ (c) =\n\nlim sup D(Pn\u03c4n +cbn , \u03c0n )\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nsatisfies lim d+ (c) = 0 .\nc\u2192\u221e\n\nHere \u03c4n is called the cutoff time, and bn will be referred to as the window\nof the cutoff. (We may simply say that the sequence Xn exhibits a \u03c4n -D-cutoff\nwhen we are not concerned with the window size bn .)\nFurthermore, it is possible to analyse the window size in more detail by\nconsidering separately the windows either side of the cutoff time \u03c4n . That is,\ninstead of using a single sequence bn to establish convergence in equations (4.2)\nand (4.3), we can consider each convergence statement separately.\nDefinition 2.3. Suppose the sequence {En , Xn , \u03c0n } exhibits a \u03c4n -D-cutoff. If\nR\nL R\nthere exist sequences bL\nn , bn with max{bn , bn } = o(\u03c4n ), such that\n\u03c4 +cbL\nn\n\nn\ndL\n\u2212 (c) = lim inf D(Pn\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nand\n\ndR\n+ (c)\n\n=\n\n, \u03c0n )\n\n\u03c4 +cbR\nlim sup D(Pnn n , \u03c0n )\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nsatisfies lim dL\n\u2212 (c) = 1,\nc\u2192\u2212\u221e\n\nsatisfies lim dR\n+ (c) = 0,\nc\u2192\u221e\n\nR\nthen bL\nn will be called a left-window and bn a right-window of the cutoff.\n\nTo the best of the author's knowledge, the only published article to identify\na difference between the left and right windows of a cutoff phenomenon is [4].\nFor the processes considered in this paper however, such a distinction will prove\nto be rather important.\n\n3\n\nSeparation cutoff for n-tuples of independent\nprocesses\n\nLet Xn = (Xn1 , Xn2 , . . . , Xnn ) be an n-tuple of independent, continuous-time\nMarkov chains on a finite space (En , En ), with initial state xn = (x1n , . . . , xnn )\nand stationary distribution \u03c0n = \u03c0n1 \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 \u03c0nn . Let\nsepn (t) = sep (Pnt , \u03c0n ) and\n\nt\nsepin (t) = sep (Pn,i\n, \u03c0ni ) ,\n\nt\ndenotes the distribution of Xni at time t.\nwhere Pn,i\n\n3\n\n\fProposition 3.1. For all t \u2265 0,\nsepn (t) = 1 \u2212\n\nn\nY\n\n(1 \u2212 sepin (t)) .\n\ni=1\n\nProof. The independence of the chains implies that\nn\nn\nt\nY\nPn,i\n(xin , yni ) Y\n(1 \u2212 sepin (t)) ,\n=\ni (y i )\nyn ,...,yn\n\u03c0\nn n\ni=1\ni=1\n\n1 \u2212 sepn (t) = 1min n\n\nsince each term in the product may be minimised individually.\nIf Tni is an optimal SST for Xni (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n), then letting Tn = max Tni one\ncan check that Tn is a SST for the n-tuple. Proposition 3.1 shows that\nsepn (t) = P(Tn > t) for all t \u2265 0,\nand it follows that Tn is an optimal SST for Xn .\nAs in [2], we are interested in processes for which each component Xni converges at an exponential rate \u03bbin , although now this convergence is to be measured using separation distance. Rather than following the route of [2] and\nusing an ordered set of rates {\u03bb(i,n) }, we prefer to work instead with discrete\nprobability measures \u03bcn on (0, \u221e), where\n\u03bcn ({\u03bb}) =\n\n1\n#{\u03bbin : \u03bbin = \u03bb} .\nn\n\n(This is similar to the use of design measures in design theory, see e.g. [15].)\nThe result of this will be that the existence of a separation cutoff can be directly\nrelated to the convergence of appropriately scaled versions of \u03bcn as n \u2192 \u221e. We\ndefine \u03ban by\n\u03ban = min {\u03bb > 0 : \u03bcn (0, \u03bb] > 0} .\nThe main result of this paper is the following:\n\nTheorem 3.2. Let Xn be an n-tuple of independent ergodic Markov processes,\neach of whose components satisfies |g\u03bbin (t)| \u2264 g(t) for all t \u2265 0, where g\u03bbin is\ndefined by\nlog sepin (t)\n+ \u03bbin = g\u03bbin (t) ,\nt\nand where g is a bounded continuous function satisfying g(t) \u2264 O(t\u22121 ). As\nabove, let \u03bcn be the discrete probability measure describing the set {\u03bbin }, with\nsupport [\u03ban , \u221e).\n1. The sequence of n-tuples Xn exhibits a separation cutoff at time\n\u001b\n\u001a\nlog(n\u03bcn (0, \u03bb])\n\u03c4n = max\n\u03bb\u2265\u03ban\n\u03bb\nif and only if \u03c4n \u03ban \u2192 \u221e;\n4\n\n\f2. The window of the separation cutoff is in general asymmetric: the left side\nis at most O(1/\u03ban ), and the right side is bounded above by W (\u03c4n \u03ban )/\u03ban ,\nwhere W is the Lambert W -function.\nAs remarked in [2], under the conditions of Theorem 3.2 the spectral gap\nof Xn is equal to \u03ban and the separation-mixing time equivalent to \u03c4n . Thus\nTheorem 3.2(i) shows that the conjecture of Peres (reported in [8, 4]) holds true\nfor separation cutoff for the processes considered here.\nConsider an n-tuple Xn satisfying the conditions of Theorem 3.2. Using \u03bcn\nand Proposition 3.1, the separation distance at time t may be written as\n\u0013\n\u0012 Z \u221e\n\u2212t(\u03bb\u2212g\u03bb (t))\nlog(1 \u2212 e\n)\u03bcn (d\u03bb) .\n(3.1)\nsepn (t) = 1 \u2212 exp n\n\u03ban\n\nOne benefit of working with separation distance in this setting is that equation (3.1) holds for any \u03bcn , whereas there is no longer a simple exact expression\nfor the total-variation distance between Pnt and \u03c0n when the rates \u03bbin are not\nidentical [2].\nThe proof of Theorem 3.2 will be established by the results of Proposition 3.3,\nLemma 3.6 and Theorem 3.7 below.\nProposition 3.3. For the sequence {Xn } to exhibit a \u03c4n -separation cutoff, it\nis necessary for \u03c4n \u03ban \u2192 \u221e.\nProof. Restricting attention to the mass at \u03ban in equation (3.1) immediately\nimplies that, for any c > 1,\nsepn (c\u03c4n ) \u2265 exp(\u2212c\u03c4n (\u03ban \u2212 g\u03ban (c\u03c4n )))\n\n\u2265 exp(\u2212c\u03c4n \u03ban ) exp(\u2212c\u03c4n g(c\u03c4n )) .\n\nFor a separation cutoff to hold at \u03c4n , we require that sepn (c\u03c4n ) \u2192 0 for all fixed\nc > 1: this fails, however, if \u03c4n \u03ban 9 \u221e (since the final exponential term above\nis bounded away from zero due to our conditions on g).\nNow, given a measure \u03bcn , define \u03c4n by\n\u001b\n\u001a\nlog(n\u03bcn (0, \u03bb\u2217n ])\nlog(n\u03bcn (0, \u03bb])\n=\n,\n\u03c4n = max\n\u03bb\u2265\u03ban\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\u2217n\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere \u03bb\u2217n \u2208 [\u03ban , \u221e) is defined by this last equality. (If there are two or more\nvalues of \u03bb achieving the maximum in equation (3.2) then we shall (arbitrarily)\nalways take \u03bb\u2217n to be the minimum of these values.) Given \u03bb\u2217n , we may define a\nnew measure \u03bdn on (0, \u221e) as follows:\n\u03bdn ({x}) =\n\n\u03bcn ({\u03bb\u2217n x})\n.\n\u03bcn (0, \u03bb\u2217n ]\n\n(3.3)\n\nThis measure has total mass (\u03bcn (0, \u03bb\u2217n ])\u22121 \u2208 [1, n] and satisfies \u03bdn (0, 1] = 1. The\nidea behind this scaling is as follows: \u03bb\u2217n describes in some sense the 'critical\n5\n\n\fpoint' of \u03bcn \u2013 it will be shown that if \u03c4n \u03ban \u2192 \u221e then any mass \u03bcn places to\nthe left of \u03bb\u2217n will not influence the separation cutoff time. For ease of notation\nwe define\n\u03b2n = n\u03bcn (0, \u03bb\u2217n ] \u2208 [1, n] .\nLemma 3.4.

Under the assumption that \u03c4n \u03ban \u2192 \u221e, the measures \u03bdn converge weakly\nto \u03b41 on (0, 1]: this is exactly the sort of behaviour to be expected if the sequence\n{\u03bb\u2217n } captures information about the cutoff time. Lemma 3.6 and Theorem 3.7\nmake this observation exact: their proofs rely on Proposition 3.5, which describes the behaviour of the function \u03b8n defined by\nZ \u221e\n\u03b8n (t) = \u03b2n\nexp(\u2212t\u03bb\u2217n \u03bb)\u03bdn (d\u03bb) .\n(3.6)\n\u03ban /\u03bb\u2217\nn\n\nProposition 3.5.

Using the measure \u03bdn , the separation in equation (3.1) may be rewritten\nas follows:\n!\nZ \u221e\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u2212t(\u03bb\u2217\n\u03bb\u2212g\n\u2217\n(t))\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\nn\nn\nsepn (t) = 1 \u2212 exp \u03b2n\n\u03bdn (d\u03bb) .\n(3.8)\nlog 1 \u2212 e\n\u03ban /\u03bb\u2217\nn\n\nNow note that the following simple inequality holds for 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1/2:\n\u2212x \u2212 x2 \u2264 log(1 \u2212 x) \u2264 \u2212x .\nApplying this inequality to the log term in equation (3.8), and bounding g\u03bb\u2217n \u03bb (t)\nby \u00b1g(t), shows that for all t \u2265 log 2/\u03ban :\n1 \u2212 exp(\u2212e\u2212tg(t) \u03b8n (t)) \u2264 sepn (t) \u2264 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212etg(t) \u03b8n (t) \u2212 e2tg(t) \u03b8n (2t)) .\nFinally, observe from (3.6) that \u03b8n (2t) \u2264 \u03b8n (t) for all t \u2265 0: the result follows\nimmediately.\nWe are now in a position to prove the existence of the left-hand side of the\ncutoff in Theorem 3.2.\nLemma 3.6. Suppose that \u03c4n \u03ban \u2192 \u221e, with \u03c4n defined as in (3.2). Let bL\nn =\n1/\u03bb\u2217n \u2264 O(1/\u03ban ).

Consider \u03b8n (\u03c4n + c/\u03bb\u2217n ), for fixed c \u2208 R. Since \u03c4n \u03ban \u2192 \u221e it follows from\nLemma 3.4(i) that for any fixed c \u2208 R,\n\u03c4n +\n\nlog \u03b2n + c\nc\n=\n\u22650\n\u2217\n\u03bbn\n\u03bb\u2217n\n\nfor large enough n.

Theorem 3.7, which completes the\nproof of Theorem 3.2, makes use of the Lambert W -function (see [7]). This is\nthe function defined for all x \u2208 C by\nW (x)eW (x) = x .\n\nW (x) is positive and increasing for x \u2208 R+ , with W (x) \u223c log(x/ log x) as x \u2192\n\u221e.\nTheorem 3.7. Suppose that \u03c4n \u03ban \u2192 \u221e, with \u03c4n defined as in (3.2). Then\nsepR\n+ (c) = lim sup sepn (\u03c4n + cW (\u03c4n \u03ban )/\u03ban )\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nsatisfies lim sepR\n+ (c) = 0.\nc\u2192\u221e\n\nbR\nn\n\nProof. In order for a sequence\nto be a right-window for the separation cutoff,\nit is sufficient to show that \u03b8n (\u03c4n + cbR\nn ) \u2264 h(c) for sufficiently large n, where\nh(c) \u2192 0 as c \u2192 \u221e. For then, using inequality (3.7) it follows that\nR\nsepR\n+ (c) = lim sup sepn (\u03c4n + cbn )\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nR\n\n\u2264 1 \u2212 lim inf exp(\u22122e2\u03b3n (c) \u03b8n (\u03c4n + cbR\nn )) ,\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nwhere \u03b3nR (c) is defined analogously to (3.10). Thus, for some finite M ,\nsepR\n+ (c) \u2264 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212M h(c)) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 0 .\nc\u2192\u221e\n\nWe therefore search for an upper bound on the function \u03b8n (\u03c4n + cbR\nn ) for\nfixed c > 0. The form of \u03c4n , and use of integration by parts, yield the following:\n!\u03bb\nZ \u221e\nR \u2217\ne\u2212cbn \u03bbn\nR\n\u03bdn (d\u03bb)\n\u03b8n (\u03c4n + cbn ) = \u03b2n\n\u03b2n\n\u03ban /\u03bb\u2217\nn\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\u221e\n!\u03bb\n\u2217\n\u2212cbR\nn \u03bbn\ne\n= \u03b2n \uf8f0\n\u03bdn (0, \u03bb]\uf8fb\n\u03b2n\n\u03ban /\u03bb\u2217\nn\n\n+ \u03b2n log(\u03b2n e\n\n\u2217\ncbR\nn \u03bbn\n\n)\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u03ban /\u03bb\u2217\nn\n\n8\n\nR\n\n\u2217\n\ne\u2212cbn \u03bbn\n\u03b2n\n\n!\u03bb\n\n\u03bdn (0, \u03bb] d\u03bb .

A continuoustime random walk Xn on Zn2 may be defined as follows. Let {\u039bin : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n}\nbe a set of independent Poisson processes, with the rate of \u039bin equal to 2\u03c1in :\nwhenever there is an incident on \u039bin , with probability 1/2 the ith coordinate,\nXn,i , is flipped to its opposite value. The unique equilibrium distribution of Xn\nis the uniform distribution on Zn2 , Un .\nLet Tni be the time of the first incident on \u039bin . It is simple to show that Tni\nis an optimal SST for Xn,i , with\ni\n\nP(Tni > t) = e\u22122t\u03c1n .\nThus Tn = max Tni is an optimal SST for Xn . (This is similar in flavour to the\noptimal SST for the continuous-time birth-death processes of [8]: there the SST\n9\n\n\fis given by a sum of exponential random variables of varying rates, rather than\ntheir maximum.)\nIt follows that Xn satisfies the conditions of Theorem 3.2, with\n\u03bbin = 2\u03c1in ,\n\nand g \u2261 0 .\n\b\nWriting \u03c1\u2217n = min \u03c1in , the sequence Xn therefore exhibits a separation cutoff\nat time\n\u001b\n\u001a\nlog(n\u03bcn (0, 2\u03c1])\n\u03c4n = max\u2217\n\u03c1\u2265\u03c1n\n2\u03c1\n\u2217\nif and only if \u03c4n \u03c1n \u2192 \u221e. In this case, \u03c4n = 2\u03c4\u0302n , where \u03c4\u0302n is the total-variation\ncutoff time according to Theorem 12 of [2].\nFor many simple examples, such as the symmetric random walk for which\nall coordinates jump at rate 1, the result of Theorem 3.7 gives an extremely\nconservative bound for the right-window. (Simple direct calculations show that a\n(log n/2, 1)-separation cutoff holds, whereas the bound on bR\nn from Theorem 3.7\ntends to infinity with n.) However, the following example shows that the bound\nof Theorem 3.7 can be achieved, and so cannot be improved upon in general.\nExample 3.8. Consider the sequence of random walks on Zn2 with \u03c1in =\nmax {1, 2 logn (i)}. The associated probability measure for Xn is\nn\n\n\u03bcn =\n\n1X\n\u03b4max{2, 4 logn (i)} .\nn\ni=1\n\nThe measure \u03bcn places all its mass in the interval [2, 4], with \u03ban = 2 and\n\u0004 \u03bb/4 \u0005\nn\n\u223c n\u03bb/4\u22121 , for all \u03bb \u2208 [2, 4].\n\u03bcn [2, \u03bb] =\nn\nFor this sequence,\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u001a\nlog n\nlog(n\u03bb/4 )\nlog(n\u03bcn [2, \u03bb])\n= max\n=\n.\n\u03c4n = max\n2\u2264\u03bb\u22644\n2\u2264\u03bb\u22644\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n4\n\u2217\nNote that this maximum is attained at all \u03bb \u2208 [2, 4]: we\n\u221a arbitrarily take \u03bbn = 2\nto be the minimum of these values. This gives \u03b2n = n, and hence \u03bdn [1, x] =\nn(x\u22121)/2 for x \u2208 [1, 2]. Since \u03c4n \u2192 \u221e as n \u2192 \u221e, this random walk exhibits a \u03c4n separation cutoff. Now, by Lemma 3.6, the left-window of this separation cutoff\nis bounded above by 1/\u03bb\u2217n = 1/2. However, for fixed c > 0 and some sequence\nbR\nn = o(\u03c4n ), integration by parts as in equation (3.11) yields the following:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nR\nR\nlog n\n+ cbR\n\u223c (e\u22124cbn \u2212 e\u22122cbn )\n\u03b8n\nn\n4\n!\u03bb\nZ 2\n\u22122cbR\nn\n\u221a\n\u221a 2cbR\ne\n\u221a\n+ n log( n e n )\nn(\u03bb\u22121)/2 d\u03bb\nn\n1\n\u03c4\nn\n\u22122cbR\nn\n.\n\u223ce\ncbR\nn\n\n10\n\n\fArguing as in the proof of Theorem 3.7, a (\u03c4n , bR\nn )-separation cutoff does not\nhold for any sequence bR\n=\no(W\n(\u03c4\n))\n(see\n[5]\nfor\nfurther\ndetails).\nn\nn\n\n3.2\n\nLinks to extreme value theory\n\nLooking back to the discussion following Proposition 3.1, where the separation\ndistance is identified as the tail distribution of the maximum of a set of independent random variables Tni , it is reasonable to ask how the above results relate\nto the theory of extreme values. If the random variables {Tni } are i.i.d. for\nall i and n then the Fisher-Tippet-Gnedenko Theorem guarantees convergence\nin distribution of a renormalized Tn to one of three possible distributions.

Let {Vni : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n} be independent, identically distributed random\nvariables, whose distribution is a mixture over \u03bb of Exp(\u03bb) distributions, with\nmixture probability distribution \u03bcn .

Let Xn and Yn be two copies of a Markov process on En with equilibrium\ndistribution \u03c0n .\nDefinition 4.1. A coupling of Xn and Yn is a process (X\u0302n , \u0176n ) on En \u00d7 En\nsuch that\nD\nD\nX\u0302n = Xn and \u0176n = Yn ,\nD\n\nwhere = denotes equality in distribution.\nThe coupling time Tnc of X\u0302n and \u0176n is defined by\nn\no\nTnc = inf t \u2265 0 : X\u0302nt = \u0176nt .\nFor a given coupling of Xn and Yn , define\nF\u0304n (t) = P(Tnc > t),\n\nt \u2265 0,\n\n(4.1)\n\nto be the tail probability of Tnc .

For n \u2265 1, let Tnc and F\u0304n be defined as above. We say that\nthe sequence {En , Xn , \u03c0n , Tnc } exhibits a (\u03c4n , bn )-coupling-cutoff if \u03c4n , bn > 0\nsatisfy bn = o(\u03c4n ) and\nF\u0304\u2212 (c) = lim inf F\u0304n (\u03c4n + cbn ) satisfies lim F\u0304\u2212 (c) = 1 ,\n\n(4.2)\n\nF\u0304+ (c) = lim sup F\u0304n (\u03c4n + cbn ) satisfies lim F\u0304+ (c) = 0 .\n\n(4.3)\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nc\u2192\u2212\u221e\nc\u2192\u221e\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nThus a coupling cutoff occurs when the distance between the two processes,\nmeasured using the tail probability of the coupling time Tnc , asymptotically\nexhibits an abrupt change from one to zero at time \u03c4n . (Note that if Tnc is a\nmaximal coupling time for all n [11] then a coupling-cutoff is equivalent to a\ntotal-variation cutoff.) As with the optimal SST of Section 3, if (Xn , Yn ) is\na pair of n-tuples whose ith coordinates may be independently coupled at an\nexponential rate \u03bbin , then Tnc is the maximum of n coupling times and this yields\nan analogous version of Theorem 3.2 for coupling cutoffs.\nFor the random walks on Zn2 considered in Section 3.1, no intuitive maximal\ncoupling is known in general; for the symmetric random walk a (nearly) maximal\nsolution is presented in [13], and a stochastically optimal co-adapted coupling is\ndescribed in [6]. However, Xn and Yn may be simply coupled by allowing their\nith coordinates to evolve independently until the time that they first agree,\nwhereafter they move synchronously. If Xn0 and Yn0 do not agree on the ith\ncoordinate (which happens with probability 1/2), then it follows that the time\ntaken for agreement on this coordinate is equal to the time of the first incident on\na Poisson process of rate 2pin , and so this coupling takes place at an exponential\n12\n\n\frate. Thus a random walk on Zn2 exhibits a coupling cutoff if and only if it\nexhibits a separation cutoff (with the same values of \u03c4n and bn ).\nIn general, the assumption that each component of the n-tuples may be coadaptedly coupled at an exponential rate is not restrictive: indeed, this is a\nreasonable assumption for many Markov processes of interest [3]. There is also\na possibility that the coupling variant of Theorem 3.2 outlined above could have\ninteresting consequences for coupling-based perfect simulation algorithms (such\nas CFTP and variants) for high-dimensional distributions.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThanks to Persi Diaconis for making time to discuss this topic during a visit\nby the author to Universit\u00e9 Nice Sophia Antipolis in June 2007, and to Pierre\nDel Moral for making this visit possible.
