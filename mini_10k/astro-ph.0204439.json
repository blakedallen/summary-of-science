This\napproximation is based in part on the ease of calculating the inverse Compton spectrum\nin a spherical geometry. This approach has served the subject well and has produced\nuseful estimates of the parameters of many blazars (Ghisellini 1997). However, when we\n1\n\n\fconsider the reconciliation of constraints based upon spectral breaks and pair opacity,\nspherical models are probably too contrived. Furthermore, consideration of the way\nin which shocked regions would arise in jets lead us away from the idea of spherical\nemitting regions. In this paper we take the first steps in the direction of determining the\ngeometry of blazar emission and how this relates to the dynamics of the underlying flow.\nThis indicates the direction for future blazar models and also indicates how models\nbased upon more realistic geometries may be better able to constrain jet Doppler\nfactors and the opacity of the diffuse infrared background.\n\n2\n\nSpherical models for Markarian 501\n\nR~1015-16 cm\nJet\n\nUB~10-4 ergs cm-3\n\np~(10-2- 100) dyn cm-2 \u03b4 \u223c 10-20\n\nSpherical homogeneous blob\nrepresenting shocked region of jet\nSynchrotron and inverse\nCompton radiation\nFigure 1: A schematic indication of the spherical blob model for the emission region\nin blazar jets.\nLet us begin by noting the results obtained by fitting spherical emission models for the blazar Markarian 501. The geometry of such models is indicated in Figure 1. Typical parameters for MKN 501, which emits synchrotron X-rays and inverse\nCompton TeV \u03b3-rays, inferred from this geometry are a radius, R \u223c 1015\u221216 cm, a\nmagnetic field, B \u223c 0.1 G, magnetic energy, UB \u223c 10\u22124 ergs cm\u22123 , particle pressure,\np \u223c 10\u22122 \u2212 100 dynes cm\u22122 and a Doppler factor, \u03b4 \u223c 10 \u2212 20.\nMKN 501 flares sporadically in X\u2013rays and \u03b3\u2013rays. Figure 2 shows the evolution\nof the TeV \u03b3\u2013rays, 1 keV RXTE PCA flux and optical emission from MKN 501 during\npart of a flare that occurred in July, 1997 (Lamer & Wagner 1998). The period of\nobservation encompasses a subsiding flare and a newly developing one, necessitating\ntwo component models for the flare. Note that the 1 keV X-ray flux does not rise until\n2\n\n\f2\n6\n3\n4\n\n5\n\n9\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n8\n3\n\n4\n\n7\n5\n6\n\nFigure 2: The integrated TeV count rate, the RXTE 1 keV PCA count rate and the\nvariation in optical magnitude for the July, 1997 flare of MKN 501 (Lamer & Wagner\n1998). Various epochs in the TeV and RXTE observations, referred to in the text, are\nindicated. The time of onset of the second flare is estimated (mainly from the RXTE\nspectra) to be at t \u2248 641.5 days\nabout a day after the \u03b3\u2013ray flux. The reason for this is apparent in the time-dependent\nRXTE spectra (Lamer & Wagner 1998) shown in figure 3. Whilst the low energy part\nof the spectrum decreases, a high energy part starts to emerge at about epoch 4 and\ndominates in epoch 6. By epoch 10, the spectrum has returned to a form similar to that\nin epoch 2 exhibiting a break in spectral index of approximately 0.3 at approximately\n6 keV.\nA two component spherical model for the combined epoch 6 X\u2013ray and epoch 6\n\u03b3\u2013ray data1 is shown in figure 4. Two synchrotron components based on energy\u2013\ntruncated power\u2013law spectra were fit to the X-ray data. We take the point of view\nthat the high energy (break energy \u223c 50 \u2212 100 keV) component whose emergence is\napparent during earlier epochs is related to the \u03b3\u2013ray flare. The low energy component\nprobably encompasses the lower energy X-rays from both the subsiding and developing\nflares. In order to restrict the number of parameters we have assumed that the magnetic\nfield is the same in each component. The model parameters for each component are:\nDoppler factor, \u03b4, the upper cutoff in Lorentz factor of the electron distribution, \u03b32 ,\nthe magnetic field (in the rest frame), B, the normalising constant of the electron\n1\n\nThe \u03b3\u2013ray observations did not extend beyond epoch 6 because of increasing moonlight.\n\n3\n\n\f\u03b52 dN/d \u03b5 (eV cm -2 s -1 )\n\n2\n4\n6\n\n1e+02\n\n1e+03\n\n1e+04\n\n1e+05\n\n\u03b52 dN/d \u03b5 (eV cm -2 s -1 )\n\n\u03b5 (eV)\n\n10\n8\n6\n\n1e+02\n\n1e+03\n\n1e+04\n\n1e+05\n\n\u03b5(eV)\n\nFigure 3: The development of the RXTE spectrum (Lamer & Wagner, 1998) over the\nperiod of the X-ray observations.

These models include examples of\nwhere a correction has been made to the infrared background and examples of where\nno correction has been made.

The TeV data have been corrected using the opacity of the\nIR background derived by Guy et al. (2000). The raw data are shown as solid circles;\nthe corrected data are shown as open circles. However, the extent of the required\ncorrection is currently uncertain.\nA typical fit to the MKN 501 flux emitted during a large flare in July, 1997 is shown\nin Figure 4. In this fit, the TeV data have been corrected for absorption by the diffuse infrared background using the opacity estimated by Guy et al. (2000). However,\nthe extent of the correction is currently controversial and we have also summarised in\ntable 1 the model parameters derived when no correction is made. It is worth emphasizing that the inferred radius of the spherical region is a parameter that is provided by\nthe model fits. Variability provides an a priori upper limit on this parameter, namely,\nthat for a variability timescale, \u2206t, the emitting region needs to be small enough that\nvariations are not smeared out.

Note that the relative transverse and longitudinal sizes are not to\nscale. Modelling shows that the longitudinal extent is generally much smaller than the\nradial extent. (See table 2).\nIn order to make further progress it is important to understand the possible processes that can lead to the production of shocks in jets. One process that is often\nmentioned (e.g. Rees (1978)) is the production of shocks resulting from variations\nin the flow velocity. We idealise the initial conditions as a velocity discontinuity with\nfaster moving gas catching up to slower moving gas (see figure 5). This is a classic shock\ntube in which the equation of state and flow velocities are relativistic. There are two\n6\n\n\fsolutions of interest: (1) Two shock waves are produced, one moving into the gas ahead\nof the shock \u2013 the forward shock, the other into the gas behind \u2013 the reverse shock.\n(2) A single shock (either forward or reverse) and a rarefaction are produced. The\ndirection of the shock in this case depends upon the details of the initial parameters.\nThe development of the two possible solutions are sketched in Figure 6.\n\np\np3\n\n\u03b2'\n\nCD\n\n\u03b2'1\n\nCD\nx'\n\np1\n\n\u03b2'2\n\np2\nx'\np\n\nCD\n\n\u03b2'\n\np2\n\n\u03b2'1\n\nCD\nx'\n\np3\np1\n\nSimple wave\n\n\u03b2'2\nSimple wave\n\nx'\nFigure 6: The behaviour of pressure and velocity in a relativistic shock tube. The\nupper part of the diagram is for the case wherein a forward and reverse shock form;\nthe lower part of the diagram is for the case of a reverse shock plus a relativistic simple\nwave. The frame of the contact discontinuity is also the rest frame of the emitting\nplasma.\nBoth of these situations are most readily analysed by transforming to the frame\nof the contact discontinuity separating the two gases. This is the approach used by\nLandau & Lifshitz (1987) for the non-relativistic case. It is also useful here since, as\nbefore, this is the rest frame of the two gases on either side of the contact discontinuity\nand is the appropriate frame in which to calculate the emissivity.\n\n7\n\n\f3.1\n\nForward and reverse shocks\n\nLet us first consider the case of a forward and reverse shock. It is useful to calculate\nthe difference in the velocities of the two shocks given the (uniform) pressure, p3 , of the\ngas sandwiched in between them. In so doing we use the ultrarelativistic equation of\nstate, p = 1/3\u01eb where p is the pressure and \u01eb is the energy density. This is equivalent\nto assuming that at this stage of the jet, some 100 gravitational radii from the core,\nthere is no entrained thermal matter and that the initial matter ejected from the black\nhole is ultrarelativistic (e.g. is composed exclusively of relativistic electron-positron\npairs). The most straightforward way to do the calculation is in the frame of the\ncontact discontinuity (CD) separating the two shocked regions, assign the ratio p3 /p1 ,\nand then use this to calculate velocities of both shocks and the velocities of upstream\nand downstream gas.\nIn the frame of the contact discontinuity, the velocities of upstream and downstream\ngas in regions 1 and 2 may be derived from the expressions given in Landau & Lifshitz\n(1987) for the relative velocity between pre-shock and post-shock gases, taking into\naccount that in the CD frame the post-shock gas is stationary. The result is:\n\u221a\n3(p3 /p1 \u2212 1)\n\u2032\n(2)\n\u03b21 = q\n(3 + p3 /p1 )(1 + 3p3 /p1 )\n(p3 /p1 \u2212 p2 /p1 )\n\u03b22\u2032 = \u2212 q\n(3p2 /p1 + p3 /p1 )(p2 /p1 + 3p3 /p1 )\n\n(3)\n\nAt this point we introduce a convenient notation for the relativistic composition of\nvelocities. We denote the relativistic addition and subtraction of velocities by\n\u03b21 + \u03b22\n1 + \u03b21 \u03b22\ndef \u03b21 \u2212 \u03b22\n\u03b21 \u2296 \u03b22 =\n1 \u2212 \u03b21 \u03b22\ndef\n\n\u03b21 \u2295 \u03b22 =\n\nand\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\nrespectively.\nThe frame-independent relative velocity between the gas on either side of the forward/reverse shock structure\n\u03b212 = \u03b21 \u2296 \u03b22 = \u03b21\u2032 (p3 /p1 , p2 /p1 ) \u2296 \u03b22\u2032 (p3 /p1 , p2 /p1 )\n\n(6)\n\nmay be used to either calculate the relative velocity in the observer's frame as a function\nof the parameters p3 /p1 and p2 /p1 or to numerically determine the ratio p3 /p1 of the\nshock to upstream pressures as a function of the relative velocity and the ratio, p2 /p1\nof the downstream to upstream pressures.\nWhat is most important for the current purposes is the difference in the shock\nvelocities since this determines the size of the emitting region in the rest frame. These\nmay be calculated from the expressions given in Landau & Lifshitz (1987) for the preshock and post-shock velocities in the shock frame. Denoting the shock frame by a\n8\n\n\fdouble prime superscript, then the velocity of the reverse shock, for example, in the\nCD frame, is given by:\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03b21\u2032 \u2296 \u03b21,sh\n= \u03b21\u2032\u2032 \u21d2 \u03b21,sh\n= \u03b21\u2032 \u2296 \u03b21\u2032\u2032\n\n(7)\n\nThe results for both forward and reverse shocks are:\n\u2032\n\u03b21,sh\n=\n\n\u2032\n\u03b22,sh\n=\n\nv\nu\nu\n\u2212t\n\nv\nu\nu\nt\n\n3 + p3 /p1\n3(1 + 3p3 /p1 )\n\n3 + p3 /p2\n3(1 + 3p3 /p2 )\n\n(8)\n(9)\n\nThe limits of strong and weak shocks are informative.\n\u2032\n\u2032\nAs p3 /p1 \u2192 \u221e \u03b21,sh\n, \u03b22,sh\n\u2192 \u22131/3\u221a\n\u2032\n\u2032\nAs p3 /p1 \u2192 1 \u03b21,sh , \u03b22,sh \u2192 \u22131/ 3\n\n(10)\n\nThese limits are to be expected from the limiting velocities in the post-shock region\nof a relativistic flow, remembering that the post-shock region is at rest in this frame.\nNote also that the range in velocities between strong and weak shocks is not great \u2013\napproximately 0.33 \u2212 0.58 c. The shock velocity difference, which determines the size\nof the emitting region, is shown in figure 7. Note that the size of the region is not\ndetermined by the relative velocity. However, the relative velocity has a role which we\nconsider further below.\nThe size of the flaring region in the rest frame as a function of the time in the rest\nframe, \u2206t\u2032 and the observer's time, \u2206t, is given by:\n\u2032\n\u2032\n|\u03b21,sh\n\u2212 \u03b22,sh\n|\nc\u2206t\n\u0393CD\n!\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0393CD \u22121\nt\n14\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2248 2.6 \u00d7 10 |\u03b21,sh \u2212 \u03b22,sh |\ncm\n10\n1day\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2206x\u2032sh = |\u03b21,sh\n\u2212 \u03b22,sh\n| c\u2206t\u2032 =\n\n(11)\n(12)\n\nTime dilation between the rest and observer's frame has been incorporated. Since the\ndifference in shock velocities does not vary greatly with the pressure of the shocked\ngas, we adopt a fiducial value of unity for that parameter.\nAn immediately interesting feature of this result is that for a Lorentz factor of 5\n(corresponding to a Doppler factor \u223c 10) and timescales of a few days, the size of the\nshocked region in the direction of flow is comparable to the radii inferred from fits of\nthe spherical model. This is a direct consequence of the insensitivity of the size of the\nshocked region to its pressure.\n\n3.2\n\nThe relative velocity and the condition for two shocks\n\nWe have already seen that the pressure in the shocked region can be estimated from\nthe relative velocity of the unshocked gas on either side of the reverse-forward shock\n9\n\n\fShock velocity difference\n\n1.4\nDifference in velocities of\nforward and reverse shocks\nin frame of shocked gas\n\n1.2\n\n2.0\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\np 2 /p 1 = 0.5\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\np /p\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n1\n\nFigure 7: The difference in velocities of forward and reverse shocks in the case when\ntwo shocks are produced.\nregion. The relative velocity also enters into the condition for a forward\u2013reverse shock\npair to occur. The relative velocity needs to be large enough to produce a pressure,\np3 , between the shocks that is greater than both p1 and p2 . The limiting case occurs\nwhen p3 = max(p1 , p2 ). This leads to the following condition on the relative velocity,\n\u03b212 of the gas on either side of the shocked region:\n\u03b212 >\n\n\u221a\n\n|p2 /p1 \u2212 1|\n3q\n(3p2 /p1 + 1)(3 + p2 /p1 )\n\n(13)\n\nIf the relative velocity is less than this critical value, that is, if the variation in\nvelocity is not substantial enough, then a forward\u2013reverse shock structure does not\nform. In order to gain some numerical insight, one can assign a Lorentz factor to the\novertaking gas (region 1) and use equation (13) to calculate the maximum Lorentz\nfactor of the gas ahead of the forward shock (region 2) for a two-shock solution to\noccur. The maximum lorentz factor is shown in figure 8 for overtaking Lorentz factors,\n\u03931 of 5 and 10. The relevant parameter here is the ratio of the pressures downstream of\nthe forward shock, p2 and upstream of the reverse shock, p1 . For example, if p2 /p1 = 2\nand \u03931 = 5 then the maximum Lorentz factor of the upstream gas is about 4.3. If the\nLorentz factor of the upstream gas exceeds this value then an intermediate shocked\n10\n\n\f12\nMaximum Lorentz factor for\nforward and reverse shock\n\nMaximun Lorentz factor\n\n10\n\n\u03931 = 10\n\n8\n\n6\n\u03931 = 5\n\n4\n\n2\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\np /p\n2\n\n4\n\n5\n\n1\n\nFigure 8: This plot shows the maximum Lorentz factor of the gas being overtaken if\nboth a forward and reverse shock are to result. The maximal Lorentz factors are shown\nfor two values, 5 and 10, of the Lorentz factor of the overtaking gas.\nregion with pressure greater than both p2 and p1 cannot be supported. The outcome\nis a rarefaction wave moving into the downstream gas and a reverse shock moving into\nthe upstream gas. When p1 > p2 the situation is reversed.\nAs in the non-relativistic case (see Landau & Lifshitz (1987)), the rarefaction region\nis described by a centred, simple wave (Liang 1977). Simple waves are based on the\nRiemann invariants, J\u00b1 , of the one-dimensional gas dynamics equations and for the\nequation of state p = \u01eb/3\n\u221a\n1 1+\u03b2\n3\nJ\u00b1 = ln\n\u00b1\nln p\n(14)\n2 1\u2212\u03b2\n4\nIn the region of right propagating simple wave, J\u2212 = constant and the equations of the\nright propagating characteristics are:\n\u221a\n\u03b2 + 1/ 3\nx\n\u221a\n=\n(15)\nct\n1 \u2212 \u03b2/ 3\n\nThese two features of a centred simple wave allow one to develop the solution in the\nrarefaction region and patch it to the solution on the left representing the reverse shock\n(see figure 6). As with the two-shock solution it is convenient to develop the shock\n11\n\n\fplus rarefaction solution in the frame of the contact discontinuity and in terms of the\npressure, p3 in the post-shock region. In this frame, the unshocked gas velocity on the\nleft is given by:\n\u221a\n3(p3 /p1 \u2212 1)\n\u2032\n(16)\n\u03b21 = q\n(3 + p3 /p1 )(1 + 3p3 /p1 )\n\nand the velocity on the right is given by:\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03b22\u2032\n\n(p2 /p3 ) 3/2 \u2212 1\n\u221a\n=\n(p2 /p3 ) 3/2 + 1\n\n(17)\n\nThe frame-independent relative velocity, \u03b212 = \u03b21\u2032 \u2296\u03b22\u2032 can be used to solve numerically\nfor the pressure, p3 in terms of \u03b212 if required.\nIn this solution, the velocity of the reverse shock in the contact discontinuity frame\n(which is also the rest frame of the shocked gas) is the same as that of the reverse\nshock in the two-shock case, i.e.\n\u03b21\u2032 =\n\nv\nu\nu\n\u2212t\n\n3 + p3 /p1\n3(3p3 /p1 + 1)\n\n(18)\n\nand the size of the shocked region in the CD frame as a function of the observer's time\nis also similar, viz.:\n\u2032\n\n\u2206x =\n\n4\n\nc\u2206t\n|\u03b21\u2032 |\n\u0393\n\n\u2248 2.6 \u00d7 10\n\n14\n\n|\u03b21\u2032 |\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0393\n10\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\nt\nday\n\n!\n\ncm\n\n(19)\n\nApplication to the flare in Markarian 501 \u2013 the\nsize of the shocked region\n\nInspection of the RXTE spectra and the \u03b3\u2013ray light curve show that the second flare\nbegins at t \u2248 641.5 days where t refers to JD\u20132,440,000. This means that epoch 6\nfor which we have presented the two component models (see figure 4) corresponds to\n\u2206t \u2248 643.7\u2212641.5 = 2.2days and X\u2013ray epoch 10 corresponds to \u2206t \u2248 645.7\u2212641.5 =\n4.2 days. The entire period surrounding this flare involved such a marked departure\nfrom the quiescent flux of Markarian 501 that it is reasonable to assume that the\nrelative velocity exceeded the critical value derived above and that |\u03b21,sh \u2212 \u03b22,sh | \u223c 1\ngiving a longitudinal size for the flaring region \u223c 1.1 \u00d7 1015 (\u0393/5)\u22121 cm. We neglect for\nnow the complications resulting from calculating the inverse Compton emissivity in a\nnon-spherical region and, in order to obtain indicative estimates of the radius of the\nemitting disk\u2013like region of the jet, we assume that the volume of the emitting region\nis the same as that of the corresponding spherical region as modelled previously. As\nrecorded in table 2, this gives radii ranging from about 9 \u00d7 1014 cm to 4 \u00d7 1016 cm.\nThus, the emitting region is a reasonably thin slice of the jet, and in the rest frame,\nthe ratio of its longitudinal extent to its diameter ranges from 0.01 to 0.3, depending\n12\n\n\fupon the details of the model. The estimate of the longitudinal size arises naturally\nfrom the dynamics of the shocked region and one does not have to appeal to adiabatic\nexpansion to limit the effective size. This is also the case for the shock plus rarefaction\nsolution.\n\n5\n\nConstraints from spectral breaks\n\nAs the flare evolves, by epoch 10 the X\u2013ray spectrum (see Figure 3) has settled down to\na shape similar to that of the original flare in epoch 2. We regard this as indicating the\nestablishment of a quasi\u2013steady state spectrum in which cooling following a shock (or\nshocks) has established a broken power\u2013law with the break energy at about 6 keV. This\nspectral feature provides further constraints on the model with interesting implications.\nThe criterion for the location of the break is somewhat contrived in the framework\nof a spherical model. This is especially the case with temporal data since there is really\nno criterion for how the radius of the emitting region would evolve. We therefore shall\nnot burden the reader with calculations appropriate for a spherical geometry and we\nonly consider the implications of the spectral break for the disk model whose dynamics\nwe have considered above.\nA break in spectral index in the context of shock-generated spectra occurs at that\nphoton energy where the cooling time of electrons is equal to the travel time of the\nplasma across the emitting region. In this case this means that the cooling time at\nthe break energy equals the duration of the flare. Often, only the effect of synchrotron\ncooling is considered. However, in many blazars the inverse Compton power is comparable to or greater than the synchrotron power and the contribution of inverse Compton\ncooling to the total cooling timescale must be considered. When inverse Compton scattering in the Klein-Nishina limit is involved (as it is for TeV blazars) the calculation of\nthe cooling time is more complicated than it is when the Thomson limit applies. However, in the Klein-Nishina limit, both the cross-section and energy transfer decrease\nand we therefore assume that the dominant inverse Compton contribution occurs for\ninteractions between photons and the radiation field that occur in the Thomson limit.\nThus, in estimating the appropriate radiation energy density for an electron of Lorentz\nfactor, \u03b3, in the plasma rest frame, one determines a cutoff photon energy, \u01eb2 , in the\nobserver's frame, defined by\nme c2\n\u03b4\n\u01eb2 (\u03b3) \u2248 \u03b4\n\u2248 5.1\n\u03b3\n10\n\n!\u0012\n\n\u03b3\n106\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\neV\n\n(20)\n\nFor a cylindrical uniformly emitting disk of length, \u2206l, and radius, R, the radiation\nenergy density per unit frequency at the centre of the disk in the plasma rest frame\nand the observed flux density are given by:\n4\u03c0j\u03bd\u2032 \u2032\nf (\u0398c )\nc\n\u03b43\n=\n\u03c0R2 \u2206lj\u03bd\u2032 \u2032\n2\nDL\n\nu\u2032\u03bd =\n\n(21)\n\nF\u03bd\n\n(22)\n\n13\n\n\fwhere\nand\n\n\u0398c = tan\u22121 (\u2206l/2R)\nf (\u0398c ) = \u0398c \u2212 tan \u0398c ln sin \u0398c\n\n(23)\n(24)\n\nFor a thin disk, \u0398c \u2248 \u2206l/2R and f (\u0398c ) \u2248 (\u2206l/2R)(1+ln(2R/\u2206l)) .

However, \u2206tc depends both explicitly on the\nbreak energy and implicitly through the dependence of urad upon \u01ebb . Therefore, in\nassessing the implications of the break in the X-ray spectrum, it is easiest to compare\nthe cooling time, \u2206tc at the observed break energy with the time of duration of the\nflare (approximately 4.2 days at epoch 10). These comparisons are recorded in table 2\nfor the various models summarised in table 1.\n\n6\n\nPair opacity\n\nPair opacity provides another important constraint on models of blazars \u2013 particularly\nTeV blazars. TeV photons interact with infrared photons to produce pairs, the rate\nof production again depending upon the radiation energy density in the plasma rest\nframe.

The opacity depends upon the Doppler factor to a large power, so that a\nlarge Doppler factor can also render the observation of TeV \u03b3-rays consistent with the\nphoton energy densities required to produce them.\nAt first sight it appears that this disk model for the shocked region offers a better\nprospect for the escape of \u03b3\u2013rays because of the reduced path length in the direction\nof the jet. However, aberration implies that in the rest frame, photon trajectories are\nalmost perpendicular to the jet thereby increasing the path length. Specifically, if \u2206l\u2032\nis the size, in the rest frame, of the disk, if \u03b8 is the angle between the jet and the line\nof sight in the observer's frame, and if c\u03b2 is the jet velocity, then the path length of a\nray through the disk originating from the back is given by:\n\u2206s\n1 \u2212 \u03b2cos\u03b8\n=\n\u2206l\u2032\ncos\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b2\n\n(30)\n\n(with the proviso that \u2206L has a maximum \u223c the diameter of the shocked region.) The\nvalue of \u2206s/\u2206l\u2032 tends to compensate for the smaller value of \u2206l\u2032 implied by our disk\nmodel so that one can only expect a modest reduction in \u03b3\u2013ray opacity compared to\na spherical model. Therefore in table 2 we have given the \u03b3\u2013ray opacity for 10 TeV\nphotons based on the diameter of the emitting disk. The emitting region is only\nmarginally optically thin in this case.\nOn the other hand, the specific normal shock configuration, upon which we have\nbased our models represents the worst case for \u03b3\u2013ray opacity. If the shock(s) defining\nthe disk, were oblique then the photons emitted perpendicular to the jet direction in\nthe rest frame would not have such a large path length and a reduction in opacity\nby an order of magnitude would result. We have therefore, as an indication of the\nreduction in opacity related to this model, have tabulated the optical depth based\nupon the longitudinal extent of the slab. Naturally this is much less and indicates the\nimportance of generalising this model to the case of oblique shocks.\nDespite these potential reductions in \u03b3\u2013ray opacity, it appears that the emission\nof \u03b3\u2013rays originates not far above the \u03c4\u03b3\u03b3 = 1 surface \u2013 the gammasphere (Blandford\n1994; Blandford & Levinson 1995).It is possible therefore, that X-ray flares generated\n15\n\n\u03c4\u03b3\u03b3\n\u2206l\u2032\n10 TeV\n0.20\n0.39\n0.015\n0.11\n\n\fat smaller radii will have no TeV counterpart. An examination of the combined TeV\nand X-ray light curves would be interesting in this regard.\n\n7\n7.1\n\nDiscussion\nSummary\n\nWe have presented a simple theoretical approach to determining the geometry of synchrotron and inverse Compton emitting regions in blazar jets that is intimately related to the dynamics of the underlying flow. Of course, other treatments of blazar\nemission regions that postulate relativistic shocks from the outset (e.g. Mastichiadis,\nGeorganopoulos, & Kirk (2001)) would give similar estimates for the size of the emitting region. What we have shown here is how the emission region patches onto the\nrest of the jet and how it is determined by the flow parameters of different sections.\nFor high enough relative velocities, the emission region is bounded by two shocks; for\nrelative velocities lower than critical the emission region patches on via a simple wave.\nIn the latter case both forward and reverse shocks are possible depending upon the\nrelative strengths of the pressure in the two regions.\nUsing this approach, we have shown that the extent (in the jet direction) of the\nshocked emission region is similar to, but smaller than, what has previously been\ninferred from spherical models. Making the approximation that the inverse Compton\nemission from a shocked section of jet is the same as from the equivalent sphere, we\nhave shown how spectral breaks and pair optical depths may be estimated. There are\nsome interesting differences here between models calculated using TeV spectra that\nhave been corrected to allow for the opacity of the infrared background (IRB) and\ncomparable models for which no corrections have been applied. Referring to table 2,\none can see that the IRB\u2013corrected models are more compact and the estimated cooling\ntimes are less than the observed duration of the flare. Moreover, the pair opacity at 10\nTeV is quite significant even in the most favourable case of basing the opacity on the\nlength of the shocked region. In the case of no IRB correction, it is feasible that the\ncooling time and the flare time become equal for Doppler factors between 10 and 20.\nIn this regime also, the pair opacity can be reasonably low. Thus it is possible that\nthe IRB opacity estimated by Guy et al. (2000) may be too high. However, in view of\nthe various approximations used, these conclusions can only be regarded as tentative.\nHowever, they do point the way to more detailed models in which the various effects can\nbe modelled in more detail. Such models should include detailed calculations of inverse\nCompton emission in anisotropic radiation fields and the calculation of the post-shock\nflow, taking into account both particle acceleration and relativistic fluid dynamics.\n\n7.2\n\nRelationship to numerical simulations of relativistic jets\n\nOur approach to modelling shocks in relativistic jets that we have described above\nis analytic and one can ask if there is there any point in such a treatment given the\nimpressive simulations of relativistic jets that have been carried in recent years? (For\n16\n\n\fan introduction to the literature on this work one may consult the recent papers of\nAgudo et al. (2001), Rosen, Hughes, & Duncan (1999) and Komissarov & Falle (1997).)\nThe answer is yes for several reasons:\n1. Analytic/semi-analytic approximations of jet dynamics are useful when modelling\nblazar emission and for other analytic estimates of jet behaviour. Simple models\n(provided they capture the relevant physics) streamline the process of model\nfitting.\n2. The numerical simulations are extremely useful for the purpose for which they\nwere intended, e.g. in comparing relativistic and nonrelativistic jet stability\nRosen et al. (1999) or in a qualitative assessment of the behaviour of superluminal components (Agudo et al. 2001). However, for computational reasons\nrelated to the Courant criterion, the jet densities of the simulations do not approach the low values that we expect of relativistic jets in AGN. To be specific,\nconsider a jet in which the relativistic electron distribution has a lower cutoff at a\nLorentz factor of \u03b3min; let the pressures of the jet and interstellar medium (ISM)\nbe pjet and pISM respectively, and let TISM = 107 T7 be the temperature of the\nISM; let a be the electron spectral index. Then the ratio of jet electron number\ndensity to ISM electron number density is given by:\nne,jet\na\u22122\n\u22486\nne,ISM\na\u22121\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u22121\n\u03b3min\n\npjet\npISM\n\n!\n\nkT\nme c2\n\n!\n\n\u22121\n\u2248 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22123 \u03b3min\nT7\n\n(31)\n\nfor a jet in pressure equilibrium with its surroundings and a = 2.2. Therefore,\nfor an electron-proton jet and an ISM temperature \u223c 107 , the ratio of densities\nis of order 10\u22125 since \u03b3min \u223c 100 (Bicknell, Wagner, & Groves 2001). For an\nelectron-positron jet, \u03b3min \u223c 10 \u2212 100 and the ratio of mass densities \u223c 10\u22128.\nThe only simulations that begin to approach these remarkable densities are those\nof Agudo et al. (2001), in which the ratio of mass densities is 10\u22123. Of course\none can learn a lot from simulations that depend mainly upon the ordering of\ndensities rather than the absolute values. However, such simulations do not give\na good idea of the interaction of the jet with the external medium since this\nstrongly depends upon the jet density ratio.\n3. It is feasible that one can utilise numerical simulations to understand internal jet\ndynamics in a jet in which the internal energy and the mass density are dominated\nby relativistic particles if the parameter\n\u03c1c2\n\u03c7=\n4p\n\n<1\n\u223c\n\n(32)\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the rest mass density (Bicknell 1994; Bicknell 1995). For the low\ndensity simulations of Agudo et al. (2001)\n\u03c1jet c2\n\u03c1ISM c2\n\u03c7=\n=\n4pjet\n4pISM\n\n\u03c1jet\n\u03c1ISM\n\n!\n\n\u03bcmp c2\n=\n4kTISM\n17\n\n\u03c1jet\n\u03c1ISM\n\n!\n\n\u2248 1.6 \u00d7 10\n\n5\n\nT7\u22121\n\n\u03c1jet\n\u03c1ISM\n\n!\n\n(33)\n\n\fFor the parameters of the Agudo et al. (2001) simulation, \u03c7 \u223c 100. For one\nthing, this means that the velocities of internal shocks are not relevant to blazar\nemission regions in such a model.\nOne could put several counter-arguments to the above. For example, the interstellar\nmedim temperature could be higher. But then one would have to reconcile this with\nthe lack of observed high temperature bremsstrahlung from AGN. In summary, the\ncurrent simulations are impressive and the various groups involved have boldly moved\ninto a previously uncharted region of parameter space. However, the simulations do\nnot currently address the physics of blazars. Clearly that is a challenge for the future.\n\n8\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank the organisers of this workshop for a stimulating meeting.
