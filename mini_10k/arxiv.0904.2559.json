This rather counter-intuitive result\nhas led to one of the most challenging theoretical puzzles in 21st century physics, namely to provide an explanation for this late-time cosmic acceleration. Currently\nthe most popular idea is that the energy density of the\nUniverse is at the present time dominated by some mysterious dark component known as dark energy and there\nhave been many proposals offered to explain its nature.\nAt the moment, the one which appears to fit all available\nobservations (Supernovae Ia [1], Cosmic Microwave Background Anisotropies [2], Large Scale Structure formation\n[3], baryon oscillations [4], weak lensing [5]), turns out\nto be the so called Concordance Model in which a tiny\ncosmological constant is present [6] and ordinary matter\nis dominated by Cold Dark Matter (CDM). However, despite its success, the \u039b - CDM model is affected by significant fine-tuning problems related to the vacuum energy\nscale, so other exotic negative-pressure fluids, often described in terms of scalar fields [7], have been proposed\nto address these issues. The problem remains however,\nthat at the present time, there is no direct experimental\nevidence for the existence of the scalar fields responsible\nfor the late time (and also the early time) accelerated expansion rate of the Universe and this has led to a search\nfor other viable theoretical schemes, many of which are\nbased on the idea that the \"dark sector\" originates from\nmodifications of the gravitational interaction itself.\nCurrently, one of the most popular alternatives to\nthe Concordance Model is based on modifications of the\nEinstein-Hilbert action. Such models first became popular in the 1980's because it was shown that they naturally admit a phase of accelerated expansion which could\n\nbe associated with an early universe inflationary phase\n[8]. The fact that the phenomenology of Dark Energy\nrequires the presence of a similar phase (although only a\nlate time one) has recently revived interest in these models. In particular, the idea that Dark Energy may have a\ngeometrical origin, i.e., that there is a connection between\nDark Energy and a non-standard behavior of gravitation\non cosmological scales is currently a very active area of\nresearch. Additionally, such modifications are appealing\ndue to the fact that they can evade constraints on the\nstrength of the gravitational field which are restricted to\nbelow solar system scales.\nOne of the most promising modifications to date are\nthose based on gravitational actions which are non-linear\nin the Ricci curvature R and/or contain terms involving\ncombinations of derivatives of R [9, 10, 11, 12]. These\ntheories have provided a number of very interesting results on both cosmological [13, 14, 15, 16, 17] and astrophysical [15, 18] scales. One of the nice features of these\ntheories is that the field equations can be recast in a way\nthat the higher order corrections are written as an energy - momentum tensor of geometrical origin describing\nan \"effective\" source term on the right hand side of the\nstandard Einstein field equations [13, 14]. In this Curvature Quintessence scenario, the cosmic acceleration can\nbe shown to result from such a new geometrical contribution to the cosmic energy density budget, due to higher\norder corrections of the Hilbert-Einstein Lagrangian.\nMore recently modifications based on a Lagrangian\ndensity which is some general function of the Ricci\nscalar and the Gauss-Bonnet term f (R, G) [21, 22] have\nbeen studied in the context of cosmology. In particular a simple extension of Einstein gravity: f (R, G) =\nR/2 + f (G) has been investigated by a number of authors\n[23, 24, 25, 26, 27]. Corrections of this type can be motivated from low-energy string effective actions and compactification of other higher dimensional theories. Uddin\net al. [28] considered the existence and stability of power-\n\n\f2\nlaw scaling solutions in f (G) models and found\n\u221a that scaling solutions exist in the model f (G) = \u00b12 \u03b1G, where\n\u03b1 is an arbitrary constant. Inspired by the work on f (R)\ngravity by Carloni et. al. [29] and Amendola et. al. [30],\nZhou et. al. [31] used dynamical systems techniques to\nstudy the cosmology of f (G) models and argued that one\ncould find cosmologically viable trajectories that mimic\nthe \u039bCDM cosmic history in the radiation and matter\ndominated periods, but also have a distinctive signature\nat late times\nIn this paper, we investigate the cosmological viability of f (G) models by investigating the conditions under\nwhich one can find power-law solutions that mimic the\nstandard FLRW expansion history of the Universe. We\ndiscover that such solutions only exist for a very special\nclass of f (G) theories. Furthermore, we show that for\nthere to be a transition between decelerated and accelerated expansion phases, G must pass through zero, and\nthere are no functions f (G) that are differentiable at this\npoint that admit both a power-law decelerating solution\nand any accelerating solution. This seriously constrains\nthe cosmological viability of f (G)\u2013gravity, since it may\nnot be possible to find an expansion history of the Universe compatible with observations.\n\n\u2022 The Friedmann equation\n8\n\u03982 + \u03983 fGG \u0120 + 3f = 3\u03ba2 \u03c1 + 3GfG ,\n3\n\n(4)\n\n\u2022 The total trace of the Einstein equations\n\u2212 4\u03982 \u2212 6\u0398\u0307 = 3\u03ba2 (3P \u2212 \u03c1) + 12 (f \u2212 GfG )\n8\n18\n+ \u03983 fGG \u0120 + G f \u0307G + 8\u03982 f \u0308G ,\n3\n\u0398\n\n(5)\n\n\u2022 The conservation equation for standard matter\n\u03c1\u0307 = \u2212\u0398 (\u03c1 + P ) .\nFor FLRW spacetimes, the\nby\n\u0014\n8 2\nG = \u0398 \u0398\u0307 +\n9\n\n(6)\n\nGauss-Bonnet term is given\n\u0015\n\u02272 \u00e4\n1 2\n\u0398 = 24 3 .\n3\na\n\n(7)\n\nWe can easily see that accelerating models have G > 0,\nwhile decelerating models have G < 0. In particular, any\nexpansion history evolving from deceleration to acceleration must pass through G = 0. This observation will be\nof importance in the following discussion.\n\nFIELD EQUATIONS FOR GENERAL f (G)\n\nWe consider the following action within the context\nof four dimensional homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes i.e., the Friedmann\u2013Lema\u0131\u0302tre\u2013Robertson\u2013 Walker\n(FLRW) universes with no spatial curvature,\nZ\n\u221a\n(1)\nA = d4 x \u2212g [R + f (G) + Lm ] ,\nwhere R is the Ricci scalar, and f is general differentiable\n(at least C 2 ) function of the Gauss-Bonnet term,\nG = R2 \u2212 4R\u03b1\u03b2 R\u03b1\u03b2 + R\u03b1\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd R\u03b1\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(2)\n\nand Lm represents the matter contribution. As we know,\nin four dimensions, the Gauss-Bonnet term is a total differential, and hence for f (G) = G, the field equations remain invariant. However for other functions this term has\nnon-trivial contributions to the field equations. For the\nhomogeneous and isotropic spacetimes, the field equations are:\n\u2022 The Raychaudhuri equation\n\n\u03ba2\n4\n1\n\u0398\u0307 + \u03982 = \u2212 (\u03c1 + 3P ) + \u03983 fGG \u0120\n3\n2\n9\n3  \u0307\n4\n\u2212 (f \u2212 GfG ) \u2212 G fG \u2212 \u03982 f \u0308G ,\n(3)\n\u0398\n3\nwhere \u0398 is the volume expansion which defines a\nscale factor a(t) along the fluid flow lines via the\nstandard relation \u0398 = 3\u0227/a, and fnG abbreviates\n\u2202 n f /(\u2202G)n for n = 1, 2,\n\nRequirements for the existence of power\u2013law\nsolutions\n\nLet us now assume there exists an exact power\u2013law solution to the field equations, i.e., the scale factor behaves\nas\na(t) = a0 tm .\n\n(8)\n\nFrom now on, we assume that m is a fixed real number.\nIf 0 < m < 1, then the required power\u2013law solution is\ndecelerating, while for m > 1 it is accelerating. Since we\nknow that within the standard paradigm, the expansion\nhistory of the universe underwent a power\u2013law decelerating phase, it is important to study these kinds of exact\nsolutions in our modified gravity models.\nWe further assume that matter can be described by\na barotropic perfect fluid such that P = w\u03c1 with w \u2208\n[\u22121, 1]. From the energy conservation equation, we obtain\n\u03c1(t) = \u03c10 t\u22123m(1+w) ,\n\n(9)\n\nand the Gauss-Bonnet term becomes\nG = 24m3 (m \u2212 1)t\u22124 \u2261 \u03b1m t\u22124 .\n\n(10)\n\nThe negative sign of G for all decelerating models is\nreflected by \u03b1m < 0 for the power\u2013law models with\n0 < m < 1.\n\n\f3\nUsing the background solutions above, we can write\nthe Friedmann, Raychaudhuri and trace equations in\nterms of functions of time t only. We can assume with\nno loss of generality that t > 0. We then solve (10) for\nt and re-write these equations in terms of G, f (G) and\nits derivatives. The Friedmann equation for example becomes\nf \u2212fG G+3m\n\n2\n\nr\n\nG 96fGG G 2 m3\n\u2212\n\u2212K\n\u03b1m\n\u03b1m\n\n\u0012\n\nG\n\u03b1m\n\n\u0013 3 m(1+w)\n4\n\n=0,\n\n(11)\n3(1+w)\n. Note that for the power\u2013law\nwhere K = \u03c10 /a0\nsolution (8), G/\u03b1m is positive at all times by definition\n(10), and therefore equation (11) is real-valued over the\nrange of G.\nSince we want (8) to be a solution at all times, i.e.\nG spans over an entire branch of the real axis, we can\ninterpret (11) as a differential equation for the function\nf in G space. This differential equation has the general\nsolution\nq\n1 m\n3\nf (G) = Am G\u0303+Bmw G\u0303 4 m(1+w) +C1 G+C2 G 4 \u2212 4 . (12)\nWe have abbreviated G\u0303 \u2261 24G/\u03b1m , which we repeat is\npositive for the power\u2013law solution (8), and\nAm = \u2212\n\nr\n\n3 m2 (m \u2212 1)\n,\n2 m+1\n9\n\nBmw\n\n(13)\n3\n\n\u221222\u2212 4 m(1+w) 3\u2212 4 m(1+w) (m \u2212 1)K\n(14)\n=\n4 \u2212 m(19 + 15w) + 3m2 (4 + 7w + 3w2 )\n\nThe constants C1,2 are constants of integration. Since we\nknow that the term linear in G does not change the field\nequations, we can without any loss of generality assume\nC1 = 0. Furthermore, if we wish to ensure that for m =\n2/[3(1 + w)] and K = 4/[3(1 + w)2 ], the theory reduces to\nGR, i.e., f (G) = 0, then this constrains C2 = 0. Hence,\nfor an exact power law solution to exist, the required\nform of the function f becomes\nf (G) = Am\n\nq\n3\nG\u0303 + Bmw G\u0303 4 m(1+w) .\n\n(15)\n\nWe note that the above form of f identically satisfies the\nother field equations, if we similarly convert them as differential equations in G space. The coefficients Am , Bmw\nare real-valued and non-zero unless m = 1, in which case\na(t) \u221d t. In general, the function f (G) is real-valued only\nif G/\u03b1m > 0, which is true by construction for the exact\npower law solution (8). Similar results were found in [28]\nusing a scalar\u2013tensor approach to f (G)\u2013gravity.\nIt is interesting to note that an exact GR-like solution\n(m = 2/3(1 + w)) is possible with non-zero C2 for f (G) =\n1+3w\n\nC2 G 4(1+w) for values of w for which f (G) is real\u2013valued.\n\nCo-existence of decelerating power\u2013law solutions\nand accelerating solutions\n\nTo mimic the standard expansion history of the universe in f (G)\u2013gravity, we assume there exists an exact\ndecelerating power\u2013law solution, and that the universe\nwas well described by this solution in the past, before\ncoming to the accelerated phase. As argued in the previous section, the existence of the exact solution fixes the\nform of f (G) as in (15), and the deceleration fixes the\npower m as 0 < m < 1, implying \u03b1m < 0.\nNow, if any additional accelerating solution exists in\nthe whole solution space of the model, then G > 0 for\nthis solution as evident from (7) . However, we can see\nfrom the form of f (G), that this is not possible, as for\nG > 0 the function is no longer real valued.\nThis problem can be artificially remedied by including absolute values of G\u0303 in (15) (similarly to [31]), i.e.\nredefining\nf \u0303(G) = Am\n\nr\n\nG\u0303 + Bmw G\u0303\n\n3\n4 m(1+w)\n\n.\n\n(16)\n\nThis function f \u0303(G) now seems to allow for both a decelerating power\u2013law solution and accelerating solutions.\nHowever, f \u0303(G) is not differentiable at G = 0 and hence\nno longer a C 2 -function, which is required for any Lagrangian in the Einstein Hilbert action. Any expansion\nhistory evolving from deceleration to acceleration must\npass through G = 0, and we can easily see that the field\nequations are no longer defined at this point. Hence we\ncan conclude that no well\u2013defined C 2 action in f (G)\u2013\ngravity can allow for exact decelerating power\u2013law solutions to co-exist with accelerating solutions.\n\nComparison to f (R)\u2013gravity\n\nIt is interesting to note that in f (R)\u2013gravity the same\nargument cannot be carried through. One important difference between f (R)\u2013 and f (G)\u2013gravity is that in f (G)\u2013\ngravity the energy-momentum tensor decouples from the\ncorrection terms. In f (R)\u2013gravity on the other hand, the\ncorrection term modifies the matter energy-momentum\n1\nM\nM\nTab\n. Contensor, which becomes rescaled to T\u0303ab\n= f \u2032 (R)\nsequently it is not possible to convert the field equations\nin f (R)\u2013gravity to linear differential equations for the\nfunction f (R) in R space, but instead one obtains a\nnon-linear differential equation. This equation cannot\nbe solved easily, and in particular does not have a unique\nsolution as is the case in the f (G) analogue. Additionally,\nsince in f (G)\u2013gravity matter decouples from the correction terms any matter dominated era must strictly obey\nthe corresponding GR type power\u2013law behavior.\nThe analogue also breaks down in the sense that any\ncosmologically viable model must make a transition from\n\n\f4\ndeceleration to acceleration, and therefore go through\nG = 0 (see (7)). This poses a problem for the simple models including terms of the form G n with n < 1, which are\nnot differentiable at G = 0. The value of the Ricci scalar\nR on the other hand does not necessarily pass through\nR = 0, and therefore models including terms like Rn\nmay still be viable. In fact if f (R),R |R\u21920\u00b1 = 0 for any\nf (R)\u2013gravity model, then the plane R = 0 is actually an\ninvariant sub-manifold. This means that no solution can\ncross that plane in phase space. For example, for any\nn < 1, Rn is not differentiable at R = 0, but any solution can only approach this plane from either side and\nnot reach it in finite time. In fact, as shown in [19] and\n[20], in Rn \u2013gravity a Friedmann like matter dominated\ndecelerated solution co-exists with a de\u2013Sitter like accelerated solution. These two fixed points can be linked\nwithout R changing sign, i.e. the field equations are well\ndefined and fully differentiable along the entire orbit.\n\nat the transition from deceleration to acceleration.\nOne possible way around this problem stems from the\nfact that our conclusions are based on the requirement\nthat there exists an exact power\u2013law solution. If however\nthe scale factor behaves like a(t) \u221d e\u039bt tm , then at early\ntimes a(t) \u221d tm . In this case the basic assumption of our\nanalysis is not satisfied.\nWe therefore conclude that when looking for cosmologically viable solutions or fixed points in the dynamical systems state space in f (G)\u2013gravity, one should not\nlook for exact power\u2013law solutions, but rather exact solutions that approximate decelerating power\u2013law solutions\nat early times. Furthermore, we must restrict ourselves\nto functions f (G) that are at least C 2 functions, and in\nparticular differentiable at G = 0.\nThe authors would like to thank the National Research\nFoundation (South Africa) for financial support. RG\nwould like to thank the University of Cape Town for a\nVice Chancellor's Postdoctoral Fellowship.\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\n\nThe expansion history of the Universe is thought to\nhave undergone a phase of decelerated power\u2013law expansion followed by late time acceleration. Therefore,\npower\u2013law solutions play an important role in cosmology as matter dominated phases that later connect to an\naccelerating phase.\nIn this work we have shown that exact power\u2013law solutions in f (G)\u2013gravity only exist for the very special class\nof models given in (15). In particular, many of the popular f (G)-models, e.g. all examples considered in [32], do\nnot allow for any exact power\u2013law solutions. This means\nthat for these models, there exists no exact matter dominated solution, and therefore these models may not be\nof cosmological interest.\nFurthermore, we have shown that decelerating power\u2013\nlaw solutions cannot co\u2013exist with any accelerating solutions, since no differentiable function f (G) can admit\nboth decelerating power\u2013law solutions and accelerating\nsolutions. The problem may be remedied by including absolute values in (15). However, this makes f (G)\nnon-differentiable at G = 0, which is the value G takes\nwhen the scale factor evolves from deceleration to acceleration, and therefore cannot be ignored. This result\nseriously constrains the cosmological viability of f (G)\u2013\ngravity, since it may not be possible to obtain an expansion history similar to the \u039b - CDM model in this context.\nThis issue has not been addressed in recent papers [31],\nwhere dynamical systems methods were used to study\ncertain classes of f (G)\u2013gravity models. It must be emphasized that even if equilibrium points corresponding to\nboth decelerating power\u2013law and accelerating solutions\nare found to co-exist as in [31], there cannot exist any\ntrajectories connecting these points, since these solutions\ncan only co-exist for actions that are non-differentiable\n\n[1] S.
