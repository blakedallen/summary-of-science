We\nprove that Zwanziger's action with the inclusion of the operator A2\u03bc is renormalizable to all\norders of perturbation theory, obeying the renormalization group equations. This allows to\nstudy the dimension two gluon condensate A2\u03bc by the local composite operator formalism\nwhen the restriction to the Gribov region \u03a9 is taken into account. The resulting effective\naction is evaluated at one-loop order in the MS scheme. We obtain explicit values for the\nGribov parameter and for the mass parameter due to A2\u03bc , but the expansion parameter\nturns out to be rather large. Furthermore, an optimization of the perturbative expansion in\norder to reduce the dependence on the renormalization scheme is performed. The properties\nof the vacuum energy, with or without the inclusion of the condensate A2\u03bc , are investigated.\nIn particular, it is shown that in the original Gribov-Zwanziger formulation, i.e. without\nthe inclusion of the operator A2\u03bc , the resulting vacuum energy is always positive at oneloop order, independently from the choice of the renormalization scheme and scale. In the\npresence of A2\u03bc , we are unable to come to a definite conclusion at the order considered. In\nthe MS scheme, we still find a positive vacuum energy, again with a relatively large expansion\nparameter, but there are renormalization schemes in which the vacuum energy is negative,\nalbeit the dependence on the scheme itself appears to be strong. Concerning the behaviour of\nthe gluon and ghost propagators, we recover the well known consequences of the restriction to\nthe Gribov region, and this in the presence of A2\u03bc , i.e. an infrared suppression of the gluon\npropagator and an enhancement of the ghost propagator.

This condensate was\nalready introduced in [18] in order to analyze the gluon propagator within the Operator Product\nExpansion (OPE), while in [19] the condensate A2i was considered in the Coulomb gauge. A\nrenormalizable effective potential for A2\u03bc has been constructed and evaluated in analytic form\nup to two-loop order in the Landau gauge within the local composite operator (LCO) formalism\nin [3, 12]. The output of these investigations is that a non-vanishing condensate is favoured as\nit lowers the vacuum energy. The renormalizability of the local composite operator formalism,\nsee [20] for an introduction to the method, was proven to all orders of perturbation theory, in\nthe case of A2\u03bc , in [11] using the algebraic renormalization technique [21]. Besides the Landau gauge, the method was extended to other gauges as, for instance, the Curci-Ferrari gauge\n[22, 23], the linear covariant gauges [24, 25] and, more recently, the maximal Abelian gauge [26].\nAs a consequence of the existence of a non-vanishing condensate A2\u03bc , a dynamical mass parameter for the gluons can be generated in the gauge fixed Lagrangian, see [3, 12, 25]. We mention\nthat a gluon mass has been proven to be rather useful in the phenomenological context, see e.g.\n[27, 28, 29]. Moreover, mass parameters are commonly used in the fitting formulas for the data\nobtained in lattice simulations, where the gluon propagator has been studied to a great extent\nin the Landau gauge [30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36].\nThe lattice results so far obtained have provided firm evidence of the suppression of the gluon\npropagator in the infrared region, in the Landau gauge. Next to the gluon propagator, also the\nghost propagator has been investigated numerically on the lattice [34, 35, 36, 37, 38], exhibiting\nan infrared enhancement. It is worth remarking that, in agreement with lattice results, this\ninfrared behaviour of the gluon as well as of the ghost propagator has been obtained in the\nanalysis of the Schwinger-Dyson equations, see [39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46], as well as in a\nstudy making use of the exact renormalizaton group technique [47].\nThe aim of the present work is to investigate further the condensation of the operator A2\u03bc\nin the Landau gauge using the local composite operator formalism. This will be done by taking\ninto account the nonperturbative effects related to the existence of the Gribov ambiguities [48],\nwhich are known to affect the Landau gauge fixing condition, \u2202\u03bc Aa\u03bc = 0. As a consequence of the\nexistence of the Gribov copies, the domain of integration in the path integral has to be restricted\nin a suitable way. Gribov's orginal proposal was to restrict the domain of integration to the\nregion \u03a9 whose boundary \u2202\u03a9 is the first Gribov horizon,\nwhere the first vanishing eigenvalue\n\u0001\nof the Faddeev-Popov operator, \u2212\u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03b4ab + gf acb Ac\u03bc , appears [48]. Within the region \u03a9 the\n\u0001\nFaddeev-Popov operator is positive definite, i.e. \u2212\u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03b4ab + gf acb Ac\u03bc > 0. One of the main\nresults of Gribov's work [48] was that the gluon, respectively ghost propagator, got suppressed,\nrespectively enhanced, in the infrared due to the restriction to the region \u03a9.\nIn two previous papers [49, 50], we have already worked out the consequences of the restriction to the Gribov region \u03a9 when the dynamical generation of a gluon mass parameter due to\nA2\u03bc takes place, also finding an infrared suppression of the gluon and an enhancement of the\nghost propagator. In [49], we closely followed the setup of Gribov's paper [48]. In this work,\nwe shall rely on the Zwanziger local formulation of the Gribov horizon. In a series of papers\n2\n\n\f[51, 52], Zwanziger has been able to implement the restriction to the Gribov region \u03a9 through\nthe introduction of a nonlocal horizon function appearing in the Boltzmann weight defining the\nEuclidean Yang-Mills measure. More precisely, according to [51, 52], the starting Yang-Mills\nmeasure in the Landau gauge is given by\nd\u03bc\u03b3 = DA\u03b4(\u2202\u03bc Aa\u03bc ) det(M)e\u2212(SYM +\u03b3\nwhere\n\n4H\n\n),\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\nMab = \u2212\u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03b4ab + gf acb Ac\u03bc ,\n\nand\nH=\n\nZ\n\n4\n\nSYM =\n\n1\n4\n\n2\n\nZ\n\nd xh(x) = g\n\nZ\n\n(1.2)\n\na\na\nd4 xF\u03bc\u03bd\nF\u03bc\u03bd\n,\n\nd4 xf abc Ab\u03bc M\u22121\n\n(1.1)\n\n(1.3)\n\u0001ad\n\nf dec Ae\u03bc ,\n\n(1.4)\n\nis the so-called horizon function, which implements the restriction to the Gribov region. Notice\nthat H is nonlocal. The parameter \u03b3, known as the Gribov parameter, has the dimension of a\nmass and is not free, being determined by the horizon condition\n\u0001\nhh(x)i = 4 N 2 \u2212 1 ,\n(1.5)\n\nwhere the expectation value hh(x)i has to be evaluated with the measure d\u03bc\u03b3 . To the first order,\nthe horizon condition (1.5) reads, in d dimensions,\nN (d \u2212 1) 2\ng\n1=\n4\n\nZ\n\ndd k\n(2\u03c0)\n\nd\n\nk4\n\n1\n.\n+ 2N g2 \u03b3 4\n\n(1.6)\n\nThis equation coincides with the original gap equation derived by Gribov for the parameter \u03b3\n[48].\nAlbeit nonlocal, the horizon function H can be localized through the introduction of a suitable set of additional fields. As shown in [51, 52, 53], the resulting local action turns out to\nbe renormalizable to all orders of perturbation theory. Remarkably, we shall be able to prove\nthat this feature is preserved when the local operator A2\u03bc is introduced in the Zwanziger action.\nMoreover, the resulting theory turns out to obey a homogeneous renormalization group equation.\nThese important properties will allow us to study the condensation of the operator A2\u03bc within a\nlocal renormalizable framework when the restriction to the Gribov region \u03a9 is implemented.\nIt is worth remarking that the Gribov region is not free from gauge copies [54, 55, 56, 57],\ni.e. Gribov copies still exist inside \u03a9. To avoid the presence of these additional copies, a further\nrestriction to a smaller region \u039b, known as the fundamental modular region, should be implemented. At present, a clear understanding of the role played by these additional copies appears\nto be a very difficult task. Nevertheless, we should mention that, recently, it has been argued\nin [58] that the additional copies existing inside \u03a9 could have no influence on the expectation\nvalues, so that averages calculated over \u039b or \u03a9 might give the same value.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we give a short account of how the nonlocal horizon functional H can be localized by means of the introduction of additional fields. In\nsection 3, we prove the renormalizability, to all orders of perturbation theory, of Zwanziger's\naction in the presence of the operator A2\u03bc , introduced through the local composite operator formalism. As the model has a rich symmetry structure, translated into several Ward identities,\n3\n\n\fit turns out that only three independent renormalization factors are necessary. The resulting\nquantum effective action obeys a homogeneous renormalization group equation, as explicitly\nverified at one-loop order. From this effective action, two coupled gap equations, associated to\nthe condensate A2\u03bc and to the Gribov parameter \u03b3, are derived. Section 4 is devoted to the\nstudy of these gap equations at one-loop order in the MS renormalization scheme. It is worth\nmentioning that, under certain conditions, we find that it is possible that the condensate A2\u03bc\nis positive when the horizon condition is imposed. We prove that in the MS scheme, and at\none-loop order, the solution of the gap equations is necessarily one with A2\u03bc > 0. We recall\nthat without the restriction to the Gribov region \u03a9, the value found for A2\u03bc using the local\ncomposite operator formalism is negative, see [3, 12, 25]. Let us also mention here that in\n[6, 7, 8, 9], a positive estimate for A2\u03bc was obtained when using the OPE in combination with\nA2\u03bc . These works were based on the observation of a certain discrepancy at relatively large\nmomentum between the expected perturbative behaviour and the obtained lattice behaviour of\ne.g. the effective strong coupling constant and gluon propagator. This discrepancy could be\naccounted for by power corrections in q12 , due to a positive A2\u03bc OPE gluon condensate. The\npresence of such power corrections has also been discussed in [59]. We do not know if there\nis a direct connection between the condensate A2\u03bc that we determine, and A2\u03bc OPE , as the\nlatter is expected to contain only infrared contributions, according to an OPE treatment, while\nthe gap equations fixing the gluon condensate and the Gribov parameter are evaluated using\nperturbation theory, implying that reliable results are only to be expected at a sufficiently large\nscale.\nAlthough the expansion parameter proves to be rather large, an attempt to obtain explicit\nvalues for the Gribov and gluon mass parameter is still presented. Also, we shall prove that in\nthe original Gribov-Zwanziger model, the vacuum energy is always positive at one-loop order,\nirrespective of the choice of renormalization scheme and scale. We outline the importance of the\n2 , via\nsign of the vacuum energy, as it is related to the gauge invariant gluon condensate F\u03bc\u03bd\nthe trace anomaly. From\n\u03b2(g 2 ) 2\n\u03b8\u03bc\u03bc =\nF ,\n(1.7)\n2g2 \u03bc\u03bd\n2 . In particular,\nthe vacuum energy can be traced back to the value of the gluon condensate F\u03bc\u03bd\nfor N = 3, from this anomaly one deduces\n\u001c 2\n\u001d\ng\n32\n2\n(1.8)\nF\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212 Evac ,\n2\n4\u03c0\n11\n\nwhere the one-loop \u03b2-function\nD 2 has Ebeen used. Hence, a positive vacuum energy implies a negative\ng\n2\nvalue for the condensate 4\u03c0\n2 F\u03bc\u03bd . This is in contradiction with what is found. In QCD, with\nD 2\nE\ng\n2\nquarks present, one can extract phenomenological values for 4\u03c0\nvia the sum rules [60],\nF\n2 \u03bc\u03bd\nobtaining positive values for this condensate. It was discussed in [61] how to obtain an estimate\nfor it by means of lattice calculations. In the case of N = 3 Yang-Mills theory without quarks,\nit was found that\n\u001c 2\n\u001d\ng\n2\nF\n= 0.14 \u00b1 0.02GeV 4 .\n(1.9)\n4\u03c0 2 \u03bc\u03bd\nLet us mention here that the Yang-Mills\n\u03b2-function\nis negative up to the (known) four-loop orE\nD 2\ng\n2\nder [62, 63, 64]. Hence, Evac and 4\u03c02 F\u03bc\u03bd will continue to have opposite sign at higher order.\nFrom this viewpoint, it seems to us that it would be an asset that the vacuum energy obtained\nfrom any kind of calculation is at least negative.\n\n4\n\n\fIn section 5 we present an optimized expansion in order to reduce the dependence on the choice\nof renormalization scheme to a single parameter b0 , related to the coupling constant renormalization. This is achieved by exchanging the mass parameters by their renormalization scale and\nscheme invariant counterparts and by re-expanding the series in the one-loop coupling constant.\nFor b0 = 0, which corresponds to the MS scheme, we find a positive A2\u03bc , positive Evac and\n2 . However, we find that a region of b is existing in which the vacuum\nhence negative F\u03bc\u03bd\n0\nenergy is negative, but unfortunately the dependence on b0 in this region happens to be very\nlarge. A higher order analysis seems to be required to reach more definite conclusions about the\n2 .\nsign of A2\u03bc , Evac or F\u03bc\u03bd\nFor the benefit of the reader, we provide in section 6 an overview of some important consequences stemming from the presence of the Gribov and gluon mass parameters on the gluon and\nghost propagators. We point out a particular renormalization property of the Zwanziger action\nin order to ensure the enhancement of the ghost propagator. Conclusions are written down in\nsection 7, while the technical details of our work have been collected in the Appendices A and\nB.\n\n2\n\nLocal action from the restriction to the Gribov region.\n\nAs explained in [51, 52], the nonlocal functional H can be localized by means of the introduction\nof a suitable set of additional ghost fields.

This is a remarkable feature of the Zwanziger action, allowing us to discuss the\ncondensation of the operator Aa\u03bc Aa\u03bc when the restriction to the Gribov region \u03a9 is implemented.\nTo discuss the renormalizability of the model in the presence of A2\u03bc , we start from the following\ncomplete action\n\u03a3 = S0 + Ss + Sext ,\n(3.1)\nwhere Ss is the term containing all needed local composite operators with their respective local\nsources, and is given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n1 a a 1\na\na\nai ai\n4\nai\nai\n(3.2)\nSs = s d x \u2212U\u03bc (D\u03bc \u03c6i ) \u2212 V\u03bc (D\u03bc \u03c9 i ) \u2212 U\u03bc V\u03bc + \u03b7A\u03bc A\u03bc \u2212 \u03b6\u03c4 \u03b7 ,\n2\n2\nwhere the BRST operator acts as\nsU\u03bcai = M\u03bcai ,\n\nsM\u03bcai = 0 ,\n\nsV\u03bcai = N\u03bcai ,\n\nsN\u03bcai = 0 ,\n\n(3.3)\n\nand\ns\u03b7 = \u03c4 ,\n\ns\u03c4 = 0 .\n\n(3.4)\n\nTherefore, for Ss one gets\nZ\n\u0010\nSs =\nd4 x \u2212M\u03bcai (D\u03bc \u03c6i )a \u2212 gU\u03bcai f abc (D\u03bc c)b \u03c6ci + U\u03bcai (D\u03bc \u03c9i )b\n\u2212 N\u03bcai (D\u03bc \u03c9 i )a \u2212 V\u03bcai (D\u03bc \u03c6i )a + gV\u03bcai f abc (D\u03bc c)b \u03c9 ci\n\u2212\n\nM\u03bcai V\u03bcai\n\n+\n\nU\u03bcai N\u03bcai\n\n1\n1\n+ \u03c4 Aa\u03bc Aa\u03bc + \u03b7Aa\u03bc \u2202\u03bc ca \u2212 \u03b6\u03c4 2\n2\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(3.5)\n\nAs already noticed, the sources M\u03bcai , V\u03bcai are needed to introduce the composite operators\n(D\u03bc \u03c6i )a and (D\u03bc \u03c6i )a . The sources U\u03bcai , N\u03bcai define the BRST variations of these operators,\ngiven by (D\u03bc \u03c9i )b and (D\u03bc \u03c9i )a .

We also notice that the complete\naction \u03a3 contains terms\n\u0001\nquadratic in the external sources, namely M\u03bcai V\u03bcai \u2212 U\u03bcai N\u03bcai and \u03b6\u03c4 2 . These terms, allowed\nby power counting, are in fact needed for the multiplicative renormalizability of the model. As\n7\n\n\fshown in [3], the dimensionless LCO parameter \u03b6 of the quadratic term in the source \u03c4 is needed\nto account for the divergences present in the correlation function A2\u03bc (x)A2\u03bd (y) for x \u2192 y. It\nshould be remarked that, unlike for the term quadratic in the external source\n\u03c4 , we have not\n\u0001\nai\nai\nai\nai\nintroduced a new free parameter for the quadratic term M\u03bc V\u03bc \u2212 U\u03bc N\u03bc in expression (3.5).\nAs we shall see, this term goes through the renormalization without the need of introducing a\nnew parameter for its renormalizability. This is a remarkable feature of the Zwanziger action\nwhich plays an important role when the ghost propagator in the presence of the Gribov horizon\nwill be discussed, see section 6.\nFinally, the term Sext is the source term needed to define the nonlinear BRST transformations\nof the gauge and ghost fields, i.e.\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n1 a abc b c\na\n4\na\n.\n(3.7)\nSext = d x \u2212K\u03bc (D\u03bc c) + gL f c c\n2\nThe technical details concerning the algebraic renormalization procedure have been worked out\nin Appendix A. In summary, the Zwanziger action in the presence of the local operator Aa\u03bc Aa\u03bc\nis multiplicative renormalizable. In turn, this ensures that the quantum effective action obeys\nthe homogeneous renormalization group equations (RGE). This is an important feature of the\nmodel, which will be useful when we shall try to obtain estimates for both the Gribov and mass\nparameter.\nab , N ab , K a , La and \u03b7 equal to zero\nThe effective action is defined upon setting the sources U\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\nand implementing the condition (2.10).

Since the l.h.s. of eq.(4.37) is necessarily positive for a meaningful result (i.e.\ng2 \u2265 0), there is no solution with m2 > 0. As already mentioned, there are a priori also possible\nsolutions with m2 < 0.\nTo investigate the existence of a solution with m2 < 0, it might be instructive to look again\nat the gap equations (4.22) and (4.23) from another perspective. We recall that, if the horizon\nis not implemented, i.e. \u03bb \u2261 0, the gap equation (4.23) has two solutions, a perturbative one\n5\n\nWe have already factored out m2 or \u03bb3 since these are non-zero in the present case.\n\n15\n\n\fcorresponding to m2 = 0 (no condensation) and a non-perturbative one corresponding to the\nm2 given in eq.(4.31).\nIf we momentarily consider \u03bb as a free, adjustable parameter of the theory, eq.(4.23) dictates\nhow m2 becomes a function of the parameter \u03bb. From the result at \u03bb = 0, we could expect that\ntwo branches of solutions would evolve, one starting from the perturbative and one from the\nnon-perturbative value of m2 at \u03bb = 0. When \u03bb \u2261 0, the choice for the scale \u03bc is quite obvious\n2\nare vanishing. However, when \u03bb 6= 0, we\nfrom the requirement that all the logarithms ln m\n\u03bc2\n2+\n\nnotice that there are two kinds of logarithms present, being ln m\nWe opt to set\n\u221a\nm2 + m4 \u2212 \u03bb4\n.\n\u03bc2 =\n2\n\n\u221a\n\nm4 \u2212\u03bb4\n2\u03bc2\n\n2\u2212\n\nand ln m\n\n\u221a\n\nm4 \u2212\u03bb4\n.\n2\u03bc2\n\n(4.38)\n\n4\n4\nThis reduces to \u03bc2 = m2 if \u03bb = 0, while it allows for6 m2 < 0. This is possible if m\n\u221a \u2264 \u03bb , as\n2\n4\n4\nit was mentioned below eq.(4.8).

In Figure 1, we have plotted the behaviour of m2 (\u03bb4 ).\nWe see that next to the \"non-perturbative\" branch of solutions, starting from m2 6= 0, also a\n\"perturbative\" branch of solutions with m2 < 0 is emerging from m2 = 0, in correspondence\nwith our expectation.\n\nm^2\n5\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\nlambda^4\n\n-5\n-10\n\nFigure 1: m2 as a function of \u03bb4 , in units \u039bMS = 1.\n\nHowever, \u03bb4 is not a free parameter of the theory. We should require that \u03bb4 is such that\nthe doublet (\u03bb4 , m2 (\u03bb4 )) is a solution of the gap equation (4.22), i.e. the horizon condition. In\nFigure 2, we have plotted the value of the horizon condition equation, as a function of \u03bb4 . It\nis clear that no solution with m2 > 0 exists as the horizon condition never becomes zero. Of\ncourse, this is in correspondence with the foregoing general proof that there is never such a\nsolution, independently of the choice of \u03bc. However, we see that there is a single solution with\nm2 < 0.\n6\n\nEvidently, \u03bc2 should be real and positive, hence the modulus in eq.(4.38).\n\n16\n\n\fhorizon condition\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\nlambda^4\n\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-0.6\n-0.8\n\nFigure 2: The horizon condition (4.22) as a function of \u03bb4 , in units \u039bMS = 1.

Apparently, the solution of the coupled gap\nequations is laying on the \"perturbative\" branch, being the one with m2 \u2264 0. This gives rise\nto a positive value for the mass dimension two gluon condensate A2\u03bc . When the restriction\non the domain of integration in the path integral is not implemented, as in the previous papers\n[3, 12, 25], A2\u03bc was necessarily negative, the reason being that the action should be real-valued,\nas it was explained below eq.(4.8). As already explained in the Introduction, a finding a bit\nunfortunate is that the vacuum\nis positive, eq.(4.42), which leads to a negative estimate\nE\nD 2 energy\ng\n2\nfor the gluon condensate 4\u03c02 F\u03bc\u03bd via the trace anomaly, eq.(1.8). Essentially, we are thus left\nwith the following questions:\n(i.) What is the sign and value of m2 and thus of A2\u03bc ?\n(ii.) What is the sign and value of Evac and the corresponding value for\n\nD\n\ng2\nF2\n4\u03c0 2 \u03bc\u03bd\n\nE\n\n?\n\n(iii.) Are these values better or not when the operator A2\u03bc is added to the original GribovZwanziger model?\n17\n\n\f5\n\nChanging and reducing the dependence on the renormalization scheme.\n\nWe have already shown that the vacuum energy obtained in a one-loop approximation is always\npositive when the condensation of the operator A2\u03bc is left out of the discussion, using whatever\nrenormalization scheme.\nTo answer the foregoing questions (i.)-(iii.), one could investigate what happens at two-loop\norder. However, due to the already quite complicated structure of the one-loop effective action\nand to the fact that the calculations at higher loop order will not get any easier, this task is\nbeyond the scope of the present article. Here, we shall mainly focus on the effects of a change of\nthe renormalization scheme at the one-loop order. It could happen that, in a scheme different\nfrom the MS one, the vacuum energy is negative and/or that the coupling constant is small\nenough to speak about trustworthy results, at least qualitatively.\nSince to obtain an optimization of the renormalization scheme and scale dependence is a rather\nlengthy task, we shall not dwell upon technicalities in this section. The interested reader can find\nall details in Appendix B. We shall thus focus on the main results obtained after the optimization.\nEssentially, what we have done is replacing in the effective action (4.14) the quantities m2\nand \u03bb4 by their order by order renormalization scale and scheme invariant counterparts m\nb 2 and\n4\nb . The residual freedom in the choice of renormalization scheme can then be reduced to a single\n\u03bb\nparameter b0 , related to coupling constant renormalization. As the vacuum energy is a physical\nb4\nquantity, it should in principle not depend on b0 . At the same time, the quantities m\nb 2 and \u03bb\nshould be b0 independent by construction. This provides one with the interesting opportunity\nto fix the redundant parameter b0 by demanding a minimal dependence on it.\nThe final one-loop action turns out to be given by\n\u0001\n\u0013\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\nN 2 \u2212 1 \u22122b b4\nx\n\u03b21\nx \u03bb x + B + (1 \u2212 2b)\nln\n\u2212 b0\n\u0393 = \u2212\n2N\n\u03b20 \u03b20\n\u0001\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0013\n3 N2 \u2212 1\n\u03b21\nx\n\u03b61\n\u03b60 4 \u22122a\nm\nb x\n+ (1 \u2212 2a)\nln\n\u2212 b0\n\u00d7\nx+A\u2212\n+\n+\n2\n\u03b60\n\u03b20 \u03b20\n256\u03c0 2\np\n!\n\"\u0012\nq\n\u00132\n2 x\u2212a +\n4 x\u22122a \u2212 \u03bb\nb4 x\u22122b 5\nm\nb\nm\nb\nb4 x\u22122b\nm\nb 2 x\u2212a + m\n\u2212\nb 4 x\u22122a \u2212 \u03bb\nln\n6\n2\u03bc2\np\n!#\n\u0012\nq\n\u00132\n2 x\u2212a \u2212\n4 x\u22122a \u2212 \u03bb\nb4 x\u22122b 5\nm\nb\nm\nb\n2 \u2212a\nb4 x\u22122b\n+\nm\nb x \u2212 m\nb 4 x\u22122a \u2212 \u03bb\nln\n, (5.1)\n\u2212\n6\n2\u03bc2\nwhile the corresponding gap equations read\n\n1 \u2202\u0393\nb\nb3 \u2202 \u03bb\n\u03bb\n1 \u2202\u0393\nm\nb 2 \u2202m\nb2\n\n= 0,\n\n(5.2)\n\n= 0.\n\n(5.3)\n\nThe definitions of all quantities appearing in the above expressions can be found in the Appendix\nB.\nb4 as a function\nIn Figure 3, we collected the solutions of the scale invariant quantities m\nb 2 and \u03bb\n18\n\n\fof b0 , while Figure 4 displays the vacuum energy Evac and the relevant expansion parameter,\nN\ngiven by y \u2261 16\u03c0\n2 x .

We notice\nthat for b0 < \u22120.33564...., the vacuum energy becomes negative. However, we cannot attach\nany definitive meaning to this result. In fact, as it can be seen from the Figures 3 and 4, the\nb4\nvalues of the vacuum energy and the supposedly minimally b0 -dependent quantities m\nb 2 and \u03bb\nare extremely b0 -dependent. Very small variations in b0 induce large fluctuations on e.g. the\nenergy. This is indicative of the fact that the equations we have solved are not yet stable against\nb0 -variations in the range of the values obtained for b0 . The behaviour is better for, let us say\nb0 > \u22120.2. However, in this case, we find again that the vacuum energy is positive. The vacuum\nb4 fall of to zero for growing b0 .\nenergy Evac , as well as m\nb 2 and \u03bb\nAs an example, we set b0 = 0, which corresponds to use the MS coupling constant.

We notice that the\nexpansion parameter y is already smaller than 1, but still relatively large, while the vacuum\nenergy is indeed positive.\nThe conclusion than can be drawn from this section is that we cannot find a reliable result\n2\nwith negative vacuum energy and hence positive gluon condensate F\u03bc\u03bd\nusing a one-loop approximation. We see therefore that, in order to be able to give a reasonable answer to the\nquestions concerning the sign of m2 and Evac and to get more trustworthy numerical values, the\ntwo-loop evaluation of the effective action \u0393, at least in the MS scheme, would be very useful.\n\n6\n\nConsequences of a non-vanishing Gribov parameter.\n\nBefore turning to the final conclusions, we shall give in this section a brief account of some well\nknown consequences stemming from the presence of the Gribov parameter, to emphasize the\nimportant role of this parameter.\n\n6.1\n\nThe gluon propagator.\n\nIf there is no generation of a mass parameter due to A2\u03bc , we can consider just the action (2.2).\nThen the tree level gluon propagator turns out to be\n\u0013\n\u0012\nE\nD\np\u03bc p\u03bd\np2\nab\na b\n.\n(6.1)\n\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 2\nA\u03bc A\u03bd = \u03b4\n4\np\np\np4 + \u03bb4\nThis result, first pointed out in [48], was obtained by retaining only the first term of the nonlocal\nhorizon function (1.4), corresponding to the approximation \u2212\u2202D \u2248 \u2212\u2202 2 . The gluon propagator,\neq.(6.1), is suppressed in the infrared region due to the presence of the Gribov parameter \u03bb. In\nparticular, the presence of this parameters implies that Aa\u03bc Ab\u03bd p vanishes at zero momentum,\np = 0. When the possibility of the existence of a dynamical mass parameter in the gluon\npropagator is included, by investigating the condensation of A2\u03bc , the tree level gluon propagator\nreads\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\nE\nD\n2\np2\np\u03bc p\u03bd\np\u03bc p\u03bd\nab\nab D(p )\na b\n\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 2\n=\u03b4\n.\n(6.2)\nA\u03bc A\u03bd \u2261 \u03b4\n\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 2\n4\np2\np\np\np\np4 + m2 p2 + \u03bb4\nThis type of propagator is sometimes called the Stingl propagator, from the author who used it\nas an anzatz for solving the Schwinger-Dyson equations, see [66] for more details .\nHowever, it should be realized that eq.(6.2) describes only the tree level gluon propagator.\nIn particular, to produce a plot of the form factor D(p2 ) as a function of the momentum p,\nwhich would allow to make a comparison with the results obtained in lattice simulations, see\n20\n\n\fe.g. [31] for N = 3 and [32, 34] for N = 2, one should go beyond the zeroth order approximation, for example by including higher order polarization effects and/or trying to perform a\nrenormalization group improvement. In general, these corrections will also be dependent on the\nexternal momentum p.\n\n6.2\n\nThe ghost propagator.\n\nEven more prominent is the influence of the Gribov parameter on the infrared behaviour of the\nghost propagator, which can be calculated at one-loop order using the modified gluon propagator\n(6.1) or (6.2) with their respective gap equations (1.6) and (4.3). In both cases, the infrared\nbehaviour of the ghost propagator [48, 49, 50, 51, 52] is shown to be\n1\n\u03b4ab D a b E\n\u2261 2 G(p2 )\nc c\n2\nN \u22121\np\np\u22480\n\np\u22480\n\n\u2248\n\nwhere J stands for the real, finite integral given by\nZ\n1\nd4 k\n\u0010\nJ =\n4\n(2\u03c0) k2 k4 + m2 k2 +\n\n4\n,\n3N g2 J p4\n\n\u03bb4\n4\n\n\u0011.\n\n(6.3)\n\n(6.4)\n\nThe original Gribov-Zwanziger model corresponds to m2 \u2261 0. Thus, the ghost propagator is\nstrongly enhanced in the infrared region compared to the perturbative behaviour, if the restriction to the first Gribov region is taken into account. It is important to notice that this\nbehaviour of the ghost propagator is preserved in the present treatment, due to the peculiar\nform of the gap equation (4.3) implementing the horizon condition. In particular, from the\nexpression for the effective action in eq.(4.2), one sees that, while the term quadratic in the\n2\nfield \u03c3, i.e. 2g\u03c32 \u03b6 , contains the LCO parameter \u03b6, the first term which depends on the Gribov\nparameter, i.e. \u22124(N 2 \u2212 1)\u03b3 4 , does not contain any such new LCO parameter. This important\nfeature follows from the fact \u0001that no new parameter has to be introduced in order to renormalize\nthe term M\u03bcai V\u03bcai \u2212 U\u03bcai N\u03bcai , as remarked in eq.(A.35). While the parameter \u03b6 is required to\ntake into account the ultraviolet divergences of the vacuum correlator hA2\u03bc\u0001(x)A2\u03bd (y)i, which are\nproportional to \u03c4 2 , no such a parameter is needed for M\u03bcai V\u03bcai \u2212 U\u03bcai N\u03bcai which, upon setting\nthe external sources to their physical values, gives rise to term \u22124(N 2 \u2212 1)\u03b3 4 in the expression\n(4.2). Said otherwise, this term is not affected by the presence of a new parameter which would\nbe required if eq.(A.35) would not hold. As a consequence, the factor \"1\" appearing in the\nleft hand side of the gap equation (4.3) is, so to speak, left unchanged by the quantum corrections. It is precisely that property which ensures, through a delicate cancelation mechanism, see\n[48, 49, 51, 52], the infrared enhancement of the ghost propagator.\nAnalogously to the case of the gluon propagator, a more detailed study of higher order corrections would be needed in order to obtain a plot of the ghost form factor G(p2 ).\n\n6.3\n\nThe strong coupling constant.\n\nUsually, a nonperturbative definition of the renormalized strong coupling constant \u03b1R can be\nwritten down from the knowledge of the gluon and ghost propagators as, see e.g. [39, 34]\n\u03b1R (p2 ) = \u03b1R (\u03bc)D(p2 , \u03bc)G 2 (p2 , \u03bc) ,\n\n(6.5)\n\nwhere D and G stand for the gluon and ghost form factors as defined before. This definition\nrepresents a kind of nonperturbative extension of the perturbative results (A.33). According to\n21\n\n\fSchwinger-Dyson studies [41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46], those form factors satisfy a power law behaviour\nin the infrared\n\u0001\u03b8\nlim D(p2 ) \u221d p2 ,\np\u21920\n\u0001\u03c9\nlim G(p2 ) \u221d p2 ,\n(6.6)\np\u21920\n\nwhere the infrared exponents \u03b8 and \u03c9 obey the sum rule\n\u03b8 + 2\u03c9 = 0 .\n\n(6.7)\n\nSuch a sum rule suggests the development of an infrared fixed point for the renormalized coupling\nconstant, (6.5), as also pointed out by lattice simulations for the SU (2) as well as for the SU (3)\ncase [34, 35, 36],\nlim \u03b1(p2 ) = \u03b1c .\n(6.8)\np\u21920\n\nThe existence of a fixed point in this reasoning is dependent on the sum rule rather than on\nthe precise value of the exponents. We refer to the already quoted literature for more details on\nthe value of these exponents. We end by noticing that the form factors of the gluon and ghost\npropagator in our zeroth order approximation give rise to the sum rule (6.7), since we have \u03b8 = 2\nand \u03c9 = \u22121. Moreover, without Gribov parameter, the sum rule (6.7) is lost, and thus there is\nno indication for an infrared fixed point.\n\n6.4\n\nPositivity violation.\n\nThe behaviour of the gluon propagator is sometimes used as an indication of confinement of\ngluons by means of the so called positivity violation, see e.g. [67, 68] and references therein.\n2\n\n)\nis written through a spectral repreBriefly, when the Euclidean gluon propagator D(p) \u2261 D(p\np2\nsentation as\nZ +\u221e\n\u03c1(M 2 )\ndM 2 2\nD(p) =\n,\n(6.9)\np + M2\n0\n\nthe spectral density \u03c1(M 2 ) should be positive in order to have a K\u00e4llen-Lehmann representation,\nmaking possible the interpretation of the fields in term of stable particles.

One can define the temporal correlator [68]\nZ +\u221e\ndM \u03c1(M 2 )e\u2212M t ,\n(6.10)\nC(t) =\n0\n\nwhich is certainly positive for positive \u03c1(M 2 ). The inverse is not necessarily true. C(t) can be\nalso positive for a \u03c1(M 2 ) attaining negative values. However, if C(t) becomes negative for certain\nt, then a fortiori \u03c1(M 2 ) cannot be always positive.

Higher loop effects, which shall be momentum\ndependent, would also influence the behaviour of the gluon and ghost propagator. Hence, to\ngive a sensible interpretation of the behaviour of e.g. the form factors and of the strong coupling\nconstant \u03b1R , a more detailed analysis than a tree level one is necessary. This is however far\nbeyond the aim of this work.\n\n7\n\nConclusion.\n\nIn this work we have considered SU (N ) Euclidean Yang-Mills theories in the Landau gauge,\n\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc = 0. We have studied the condensation of the dimension two composite operator A2\u03bc when\nthe restriction to the Gribov region \u03a9 is taken into account. Such a restriction is needed due to\n23\n\n\fthe presence of the Gribov copies [48], which are known to affect the Landau gauge.\nIn a previous work [49], the consequences of the restriction to the region \u03a9 in the presence\nof a dynamical mass parameter due to the gluon condensate Aa\u03bc Aa\u03bc were studied by following\nGribov's seminal work [48]. Here, we have relied on Zwanziger's action [51, 52], which allows to\nimplement the restriction to the Gribov region \u03a9 within a local and renormalizable framework.\nWe have been able to show that Zwanziger's action remains renormalizable to all orders of perturbation theory in the presence of the operator A2\u03bc , introduced through the local composite\noperator technique [3, 12, 20, 25]. The effective action, constructed via the local composite\noperator formalism [3] obeys a homogeneous renormalization group. The explicit form of the\none-loop effective action has been worked out. We have seen that, considering the original\nGribov-Zwanziger model, i.e. without including the operator A2\u03bc , the vacuum energy is always\npositive at one-loop order, independently from the choice of the renormalization scheme. A\npositive vacuum energy would give rise to a negative value for the gauge invariant gluon con2 , through the trace anomaly. Furthermore, by adding the operator A2 , we have\ndensate F\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\nproven that there is no solution of the two coupled gap equations at the one-loop order in the\nMS scheme with A2\u03bc < 0. Nevertheless, when A2\u03bc > 0, a solution of the gap equations was\nfound, although the corresponding expansion parameter was too large and the vacuum energy\nstill positive.\nIn order to find out what happens in other schemes, we performed a detailed study, at lowest order, of the influence of the renormalization scheme. We have been able to reduce the\nfreedom of the choice of the renormalization scheme to two parameters, namely the renormalization scale \u03bc and a parameter b0 , associated to the coupling constant renormalization. We\nb\nreexpressed the effective action in terms of the mass parameter m\nb and Gribov parameter \u03bb,\nwhich are renormalization scheme and scale independent order by order. The resulting gap\nequations for these parameters have been solved numerically. Although a solution with negative\nvacuum energy was found, we have been unable to attach any definitive meaning to it. This is\ndue to the fact that the results obtained turn out to be strongly dependent from the parameter\nb0 . This brought us to the conclusion that we should extend our calculations to a higher order\nto obtain more sensible numerical estimates.\nb are of a nonperturbative nature and appear in the gluon and\nThe mass parameters m\nb and \u03bb\nghost propagator. Even if we lack reliable estimates for these parameters, some already known\ninteresting features can be recovered. For a nonzero mass and Gribov parameter, there is a qualitative agreement with the behaviour found in lattice simulations and Schwinger-Dyson studies:\na suppressed gluon and enhanced ghost propagator in the infrared, while further consequences\nof the Gribov parameter are e.g. the possible existence of an infrared fixed point for the strong\ncoupling constant and the violation of positivity related to the gluon propagator.\n\nAcknowledgments.\nThe Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico (CNPq-Brazil), the Faperj,\nFunda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, the SR2-UERJ and the Coordena\u00e7\u00e3o de Aperfei\u00e7oamento de Pessoal de N\u00edvel Superior (CAPES) are gratefully acknowledged\nfor financial support.

This is due to the dimensionality and to the Qf -charge.

According to expression\n(A.28), \u03a3c contains four arbitrary parameters a0 , a2 , a7 , a8 , which correspond in fact to a\nmultiplicative renormalization of the gauge coupling constant g, the parameters \u03b6, and of the\nfields \u03c6 = (Aa\u03bc , ca , ca , ba , \u03c6ai , \u03c9ia , \u03c6ai , \u03c9ai ) and sources \u03a6 = (K a\u03bc , La , M\u03bcai , N\u03bcai , V\u03bcai , U\u03bcai , \u03c4 , \u03b7),\naccording to\n\u03a3(g, \u03b6, \u03c6, \u03a6) + \u03b7\u03a3c = \u03a3(go , \u03b6o , \u03c6o , \u03a6o ) + O(\u03b7 2 ) ,\n(A.29)\nwith\ngo = Zg g ,\n\n\u03b6o = Z\u03b6 \u03b6 ,\n\n(A.30)\n\nand\n1/2\n\n\u03c6o = Z\u03c6 \u03c6 ,\n\u03a6o\n\n= Z\u03a6 \u03a6 .\n\n(A.31)\n\nThe coefficients a0 , a2 are easily seen to be related to the renormalization of the gauge coupling\nconstant g and of the gauge field Aa\u03bc ,\n\u0010\na0 \u0011\n,\n1+\u03b7\n\u0010\n\u00102\na0 \u0011\u0011\n=\n1 + \u03b7 a2 \u2212\n.\n2\n\nZg =\n1/2\n\nZA\n\n(A.32)\n\n\u00bfFrom expression (A.28) it follows that the Faddeev-Popov ghosts (ca , ca ) and the i-valued fields\n(\u03c6ai , \u03c9ia , \u03c6ai , \u03c9 ai ) have a common renormalization constant, given by\n\u22121/2\n\nZc = Zc = Z\u03c6 = Z\u03c6 = Z\u03c9 = Z\u03c9 = (1 \u2212 \u03b7a2 ) = Zg\u22121 ZA\n\n.\n\n(A.33)\n\nEq.(A.33) expresses a well-known renormalization property of the Faddeev-Popov ghosts (ca , ca )\nin the Landau gauge, stemming from the transversality of the gauge propagator and from the\nfactorization of the ghost momentum in the ghost-antighost-gluon vertex. We see therefore that,\nin the present case, this property holds for the i-valued fields (\u03c6ai , \u03c9ia , \u03c6ai , \u03c9 ai ) as well. Similarly\n\u0001\nto the ghost and the i-valued fields, the renormalization of the sources M\u03bcai , N\u03bcai , V\u03bcai , U\u03bcai is\n1/2\n\nalso determined by the renormalization constants Zg and ZA , being given by\n\u22121/4\n\nZM = ZN = ZV = ZU = Zg\u22121/2 ZA\n\n(A.34)\n\u0001\nIt is worth noticing here that equation (A.34) ensures that the counterterm\na2 V\u03bcai M\u03bcai \u2212 U\u03bcai N\u03bcai\n\u0001\ncan be automatically reabsorbed by the term \u2212M\u03bcai V\u03bcai + U\u03bcai N\u03bcai in the expression (3.5) without the need of introducing new free parameters.

We will not repeat that analysis here, we only mention that a\nkey ingredient in the proof of relation ( A.37) was the presence of the ghost Ward identity, and\nsince the Zwanziger action possesses that identity, eq.(A.5), one can proceed along the lines of\n[11]. Thus, there are in fact only three independent renormalization factors present.\n\nB\n\nAppendix B.\n\nIn this Appendix, we give the detailed analysis of the procedure used to optimize the renormalization scheme and scale dependence, which was summarized in section 5.\n\nB.1\n\nPreliminaries.\n\nBefore coming to the actual computations, let us first discuss some results which will turn out\nto be useful.\nConsider again the action S of eq.(3.8). Due to the rich symmetry structure of the model,\nencoded in the Ward identities (A.1)-(A.14), and due to the extra relation (A.37), only three\nrenormalization factors remain to be fixed, namely Zg , ZA and Z\u03b6 . Apparently, this means\nthat we would need three renormalization conditions in order to fix a particular renormalization\nscheme. However, taking a look at the bare action associated with expression eq.(3.8), we would\nfind the following relations\n\u03b6o = Z\u03b6 \u03b6 ,\n\u03b6o \u03c4o2 = \u03bc\u2212\u03b5 Z\u03b6 \u03b6\u03c4 2 ,\n\u03c4o = Z\u03c4 \u03c4 ,\n\n(B.38)\n\nfrom which it follows that\nZ\u03b6 \u03b6 = \u03bc\u03b5 \u03b6o Z\u03c42 .\n\n(B.39)\n\nSince the bare quantity \u03b6o is renormalization scheme and scale independent and since \u03b6 always\nappears in the combination Z\u03b6 \u03b6 in the action, it follows that only Zg and ZA are relevant for\nthe effective action, because Z\u03c4 can be expressed in terms of these two factors. Consequently,\nwe would only need two renormalization conditions to fix the scheme. Obviously, we can equally\nwell choose to make use of, for example, Zg and Z\u03c4 as the two independent renormalization\nfactors, corresponding to coupling constant and mass renormalization.\nWe will change from the MS to another massless renormalization scheme by means of the following transformations8\n\u0001\ng 2 = g 2 1 + b0 g 2 + b1 g 4 + * * * ,\n\u0001\n\u03bb = \u03bb 1 + c0 g2 + c1 g4 + * * * ,\n\u0001\nm2 = m2 1 + d0 g2 + d1 g 4 + * * * ,\n(B.40)\n8\n\nBarred quantities refer to the MS scheme.\n\n29\n\n\fwhere the parameters bi , ci and di label the new scheme. However, we should keep in mind\nthat the renormalization of the Gribov parameter \u03bb is not independent of that of g 2 and m2 .\nEliminating \u03b3A (g2 ) between eqns.(4.19) and (4.20), yields\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 \u03b2(g2 )\n2\n2\n(B.41)\n\u2212 \u03b3m2 (g ) .\n\u03b3\u03bb (g ) =\n4\ng2\nThis relation, valid to all orders of perturbation theory, implies the existence of relationships\nbetween the coefficients bi , ci and di . For further use, we shall explicitly construct the relation\nbetween b0 , c0 and d0 .

However, it turns out that such an approach is not particularly useful to implement\nin the current case due to the presence of the several scales. Therefore, the question arises\nhow one can make a somewhat motivated choice for the arbitrary parameters, labeling a certain\nrenormalization scheme. In the next subsection we shall discuss a way to reduce the freedom in\nthe choice of the renormalization parameters. The method relies on the possibility of performing\nan optimization of the renormalization scheme dependence, as illustrated in [70, 71].\n\nB.2\n\nOptimization of the renormalization scheme.\n\nConsider a quantity \u033a that runs according to\n\u03bc\n\nd\u033a\n= \u03b3\u033a (g2 )\u033a ,\nd\u03bc\n\n(B.52)\n\nwhere\n\u03b3\u033a (g2 ) = \u03b3\u033a,0 g2 + \u03b3\u033a,1 g4 + * * * .\n31\n\n(B.53)\n\n\fTo \u033a, we can associate a quantity \u033ab that does not depend on the choice of the renormalization\nscheme and which is scale independent.

It can also be checked [70, 71] that \u033ab is left\nunmodified by a change of the renormalization scheme, implemented through transformations\nanalogous to those of eqns.(B.40). The equation (B.55) can be solved in a series expansion in\ng2 by noticing that\nd\nd\n\u03bc F\u033a (g 2 ) \u2261 \u03b2(g2 ) 2 F\u033a (g 2 ) .\n(B.56)\nd\u03bc\ndg\nThen, the above differential equation can be solved in a series expansion in g2 , more precisely\nby\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03b3\u033a,0\n1 \u03b3\u033a,1 \u03b21 \u03b3\u033a,0\n2\n2\n2 2\u03b20\n\u2212\ng + *** .\n(B.57)\nF\u033a (g ) = (g )\n1+\n2 \u03b20\n\u03b202\nConsider once more the MS action \u0393 given in eq.(4.14).

This is a certain\nimprovement, since we are not faced anymore with a choice of the parameters di , related to the\nrenormalization of the Gribov and mass parameter. The remaining freedom in the choice of the\nrenormalization scheme resides in the coupling constant, labeled by the parameters b0 , b1 , . . .,\nand in the scale \u03bc. Of course, the higher order coefficients bi , i = 1, . . . do not show up here,\nsince we have restricted ourselves to the one-loop level. Nevertheless, we will perform one more\nstep, since the dependence on the coupling constant renormalization can be reduced to solely\nb0 , by expanding the perturbative series in inverse powers of\nx \u2261 \u03b20 ln\n\n\u03bc2\n,\n\u039b2\n\n(B.64)\n\nrather than in terms of g2 . For another illustration of this, see e.g. [70, 71]. The coupling\nconstant g 2 can be replaced by x since g2 is explicitly determined by\n!\nx\n\u03b21 ln \u03b20\n1\n2\n1\u2212\n+ *** .\n(B.65)\ng =\nx\n\u03b20 x\nIn [69], the relation between the scale parameter \u039b, corresponding to a certain coupling constant\nrenormalization, and that of the MS scheme, \u039bMS , was found to be\nb\n\n\u2212 2\u03b20\n\n\u039b=e\n\n0\n\n\u039bMS .\n\n(B.66)\n\nOne finally gets the expression (5.1).

However, by construction, we know\nb should be independent of the renormalization scale and scheme order by\nthat m\nb as well as \u03bb\norder. This gives us an interesting way to fix these parameters by demanding that the solutions\nb\u2217 (\u03bc, b0 ) depend minimally on b0 and \u03bc. Since this would give a quite complicated\nm\nb \u2217 (\u03bc, b0 ) and \u03bb\nset of equations to solve, we can make life somewhat easier by reasonably choosing the scale9 \u03bc\n9\n\nThis can be motivated thanks to the scale independence of the b-quantities.\n\n33\n\n\fin the gap equations (5.2)-(5.3). In analogy to the choice for \u03bc2 done in the previous equation\n(4.38), we shall now set\np\nb4 x\u22122b\nb 4 x\u22122a \u2212 \u03bb\nm\nb 2 x\u2212a + m\n2\n,\n(B.67)\n\u03bc =\n2\nIn order to proceed, we still have two quantities at our disposal to fix the remaining parameter\nb0 . In fact, we can also take the vacuum energy Evac in consideration since, being a physical\nquantity, it should depend minimally on the renormalization scheme and scale. Therefore, we\ncould determine the value for b0 by demanding that\n\u03a5(b0 ) \u2261\n\nb4\n\u2202\u03bb\n\u2202Evac\n\u2202m\nb 4\u2217\n\u2217\n+\n,\n+\n\u2202b0\n\u2202b0\n\u2202b0\n\n(B.68)\n\nis minimal w.r.t. the parameter b0 . This seems to be a reasonable candidate. When its depenb and Evac on b0 is necessarily small too. The\ndence on b0 is small, then the dependence of m,\nb \u03bb\nideal situation would be that \u03a5 is zero for a certain b0 . If no such an ideal b0 would exist, we\nweaken the condition by requiring that \u03a5 is as small as possible. The condition (B.68) to fix\nb0 can be considered as some kind of principle of minimal sensitivity \u00e0 la Stevenson [72]. An\nalternative that is sometimes used is a fastest apparent convergence criterion, where it is demanded that the quantum corrections are as small as possible\nto the tree\u0001 level value.\n\u0001\u22121 compared\n0\nand by \u0393[1] to order x1 , we could\nFor example, if we denote by \u0393[0] the action to order x1\ndemand that\n\u0393[1] \u2212 \u0393[0]\n(B.69)\n\u0393[0]\nis as small as possible when the parameters fulfill the gap equation describing the vacuum of\nthe theory.\nBefore continuing\u221awith explicit calculations, let us just remark here that the other logarithm,\nb 4 x\u22122b\nb 4 x\u22122a \u2212\u03bb\nb 2 x\u2212a \u2212 m\nb4 x\u22122b\n, could become large for a small argument, thus when \u03bb\nnamely ln m\n2\u03bc2\nwould be small compared to m\nb 4 x\u22122a . However, it is harmless since it appears in the form of\nu ln u, while we know that u ln u|u\u22480 \u2248 0.\n\nB.3\n\nNumerical results.\n\nLet us first give some numerical factors we need.

Taking a look at the action (5.1), it might be clear that the gap\nmined by m\nb 4 x\u22122a \u2265 \u03bb\nequations derived from it will be coupled and hence quite complicated to solve numerically.\nFrom the calculational point of view, it is useful to introduce new variables, defined by\np\nb4 x\u22122b\nm\nb 2 x\u2212a + m\nb 4 x\u22122a \u2212 \u03bb\n,\n(B.74)\n\u03c91 =\np 2\nb4 x\u22122b\nm\nb 2 x\u2212a \u2212 m\nb 4 x\u22122a \u2212 \u03bb\n\u03c92 =\n,\n(B.75)\n2\nwith the inverse transformation\n\nm\nb 2 x\u2212a = \u03c91 + \u03c92 ,\nb4 x\u22122b = 4\u03c91 \u03c92 .\n\u03bb\n\n(B.76)\n\nb4 x\u22122b > 0 to \u03c91 \u2265 \u03c92 > 0.

Depending on the value of the parameter b0 , there is\nmore than one solution possible. In Figure 6, we have plotted the expression (B.104) for several\nvalues of the parameter b0 , namely b0 = 0.25, 0, \u22120.25, \u22120.3, \u22120.33564..., \u22120.41594..., \u22120.5. It is\npossible to obtain those values of b0 where the number of solutions change. If we consider the\nplots of Figure 6, it is apparent that for each b0 , the corresponding curve possesses two extremal\nvalues. The number of solution exactly changes at those values of b0 where the curve becomes\ntangent to the \u03c6-axis. An explicit evaluation learns that his occurs at b0 = \u22120.41595..., where\n\u03c6 = 2.26407... and at b0 = \u22120.33564... where \u03c6 = 2.62545. It is important to know these numbers to a high enough accuracy, to instruct the computer in which \u03c6-interval it can search for a\nsolution. If the initial values are not chosen in an appropriate way, the iterations will jump between the different branches of solutions and there will be no convergence to any of them. There\nis a single solution \u03c6 if b0 > \u22120.33564... or b0 < \u22120.41595.... If \u22120.41595... < b0 < \u22120.33564...,\nthere are three solutions, while for b0 = \u22120.41595... and b0 = \u22120.33564... there are two solutions.\nIn Figure 7, we have displayed the solution for \u03c6 and R. To determine the solution \u03c6 which\ncharacterizes the vacuum, we should take that one which gives us the absolute minimum of the\nenergy functional \u0393, which was shown in Figure 3.\nAs a final remark, we would like to notice that the same decomposition as in eq.(4.7) could\nalso be useful for higher loop computations. The effective action \u0393 will remain symmetric under\nthe exchange of \u03c91 and \u03c92 and equations like (B.77)-(B.80) shall remain valid. This should\nfacilitate at least a bit the two-loop evaluation of the effective action and gap equations. Also,\none does not need to evaluate any new anomalous dimension, since these are already known,\neither from previous calculations [3, 12, 25], or from exploiting relations like eq.(B.41).\n10\n\nThe R-dependence is hidden in \u21271 and \u21272\nWe may assume cos \u03c6 6= 0, otherwise eqns.(B.100)-(B.101) would give \u03c6 = 0, which is inconsistent with\ncos \u03c6 = 0.\n11\n\n38\n\n\fgap eq. for phi\n0.75\n0.5\n0.25\n1.8\n-0.25\n\n2.2\n\n2.4\n\n2.6\n\n2.8\n\n3\n\nphi\n\n-0.5\n-0.75\nFigure 6: The gap equation (B.104) with N = 3 plotted in function of \u03c6 for the values b0 =\n0.25, 0, \u22120.25, \u22120.3, \u22120.33564..., \u22120.41594..., \u22120.5 (from bottom to top).\nR\n\nphi\n3\n\n1000\n\n2.8\n\n800\n\n2.6\n600\n\n2.4\n\n400\n\n2.2\n-1 -0.8 -0.6 -0.4 -0.2\n1.8\n\n0.2 0.4\n\n200\n\nb0\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nb0\n\nFigure 7: The angle \u03c6 and scale R as a function of b0 , in units \u039bMS = 1.\n\nReferences.\n[1] F.
