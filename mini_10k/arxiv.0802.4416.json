In\nthe early days of bubble chamber experiments, a new particle\ncould leave a distinctive track of its existence. In contrast, in\ncurrent experiments the complexity of the products of a particle collision makes it far more challenging to understand what\nwe are seeing without first viewing it through some sort of theoretical lens. There is a danger that we might be blinded by\nour expectations, that it will be hard to see something entirely\nnew unless we have already, to some measure, anticipated it.\nThis worry is illustrated by the example of unparticles [1].\nUnparticles are scale invariant, or-not quite equivalently-\nconformal, fields that have a nonintegral scaling dimension.\nAs their name suggests, these fields lack many of the properties that normally characterize particle theories. If they exist, they would produce rather different signatures in detectors from those of the more familiar particles that are usually\nconsidered. Fortunately the scale invariance of an unparticle\nallows many of its interactions with ordinary particles to be\ntreated simply and analytically.\nUnparticles could have a role in cosmology too, particularly\nin the early universe [2]. This article looks at some of the ways\nthey could affect the inflationary picture. Most ambitiously,\nthe inflaton-the field that drives the inflationary expansion-\ncould itself be an unparticle. We shall show that the conformal properties of unparticles, however, make them very unsuitable for this purpose. Yet, even if they are not themselves\nresponsible for inflation, unparticles can still produce interesting effects. If they interact with an ordinary particle inflaton, the loop corrections from unparticles can enhance the\npower spectrum of the primordial perturbations produced by\ninflation. This enhancement occurs whenever the scaling dimension of the unparticle field is less than three-halves and it\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: hael@nbi.dk\naddress: rh4a@andrew.cmu.edu\n\nis most pronounced at the large-wavelength end of the power\nspectrum.\nThis article begins in the next section by explaining how\nunparticles are incorporated into an isotropically expanding\nbackground. Section III shows why they are not especially\ngood inflatons while Sec. IV examines in detail how they\ncould influence the standard inflationary picture through radiative corrections. The final section presents our conclusions\nand we leave a few simple loop calculations in flat space to\nan appendix, which also includes a description of how unparticles might be useful in regularizing conformal particle field\ntheories.\n\nII. PRELIMINARIES\nA. Unparticles in a conformally flat universe\n\nAn unparticle is nothing more than a scale-invariant field\nwith a nontrivial scaling dimension, d. The simplest and most\nfamiliar scalar field with these properties is not an unparticle\nat all, but is rather an ordinary massless particle, corresponding to the case d = 1. Once we go beyond integral values for\nd, however, the fields no longer have many of the properties\nthat we associate with particles. There are no isolated poles\nin the propagator and there is no longer a simple dispersion\nrelation between the energy and the momentum carried by an\nunparticle. Because of its scaling or conformal properties, an\nunparticle in a conformally flat space-time is closely related\nto one in flat space, so we shall first examine this relation in a\nlittle detail for the case of a conformal particle.\nIn a curved background, it is not enough to set the mass\nof a particle to zero to insure that the theory remains scaleinvariant, since the background itself introduces another potential source for breaking it. To restore the scale invariance,\nthe field should be coupled conformally to the background.\nThus, for example, the d = 1 prototypical scale-invariant field\nin a curved background is a massless, conformally coupled\n\n\f2\nfield,\n\nB.

If\nwe denote an unparticle in flat space by \u03c7 (x) and the unparticle in a conformally flat space by \u03c3 (x), then we can again\nwrite the latter as a simple rescaling of the former,\n\n\u03c3 (\u03b7 ,~x) =\n\n\u03c7 (\u03b7 ,~x)\n,\nad (\u03b7 )\n\ndetermined by its rescaling dimension d.\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nd 4 k \u2212ik*(x\u2212y)\ne\n(2\u03c0 )4\n\n(2.8)\n\nUnitarity [3], in any event, requires d \u2265 1.\n\n0\n\ndM 2\n\ni\u03c1 (M 2 )\n.\nk2 \u2212 |~k|2 \u2212 M 2 + i\u03b5\n0\n\nFor an ordinary particle theory,\ncontains at least one\npole at the physical mass of the field. The field is then\nalso renormalized so that the residue at this pole is i, which\namounts to a renormalization condition on the theory. In contrast, for an unparticle theory, we do not have any such conditions available to determine \u03c1 (M 2 ). Instead, we appeal directly to the scale invariance of \u03c7 and the fact that its rescaling\ndimension is d to fix \u03c1 (M 2 ) completely, up to a constant factor, Ad ,\n\n\u03c1 (M 2 ) =\n\nAd 2 d\u22122\n(M ) .\n2\u03c0\n\n(2.10)\n\nUnlike the particle case, we do not have a renormalization\ncondition to set the normalization, Ad , of the unparticle; but\na frequently used convention [1] is to choose it to match with\nthe phase space for d massless particles,\nAd =\n\nd \u22121\n2\u03c0\n16\u03c0 5/2 \u0393(d + 21 )\n, (2.11)\n=\n(2\u03c0 )2d \u0393(2d)\u0393(d \u2212 1) (16\u03c0 2 )d\u22121 (\u0393(d))2\n\nexcept that, of course, here d is not an integer.\nThe integral over M 2 in the propagator converges as long\nas 1 < d < 2; performing this integral then yields a simpler\nexpression for the unparticle propagator,\n\u0001\nh0|T \u03c3 (x)\u03c3 (y) |0i\n(2.12)\n=\n\nZ\n\ni\nd 4 k \u2212ik*(x\u2212y) Ad (\u22121)d\u22122\n.\ne\n(2\u03c0 )4\n2 sin \u03c0 d (k02 \u2212 |~k|2 + i\u03b5 )2\u2212d\n\nNotice that in the limit d \u2192 1, the d \u2212 1 factor in Ad cancels\nthe zero in sin \u03c0 d. The propagator becomes that of a free,\nmassless particle, correctly normalized; so in a sense, massless particles are unparticles too. But we shall usually avoid\nthis limit, since the some of the factors become singular while\nothers vanish.\nIn an inflationary setting, where it might not be appropriate\nto treat the theory using an S-matrix formalism, it is usually\nmore convenient to break the propagator into the two components of its time-ordering.

In the usual inflationary\npicture, the effective mass of the inflaton must be quite small\nduring the slowly rolling phase when the primordial perturbations are produced. However, this case corresponds to a\nmassless minimally coupled field, rather than a massless conformally coupled one, which is the natural starting point for\nan unparticle. During inflation, the curvature changes rather\nslowly, so its coupling to the field effectively acts as a large\nmass term for a particle inflaton-the d = 1 case-which produces a highly tilted power spectrum for the primordial perturbations. Generalizing to the unparticle case, d > 1, only\nworsens the shape of the power spectrum, as we shall learn in\nthis section.\nIn inflation, the tiny primordial perturbations begin as the\nfluctuations of a quantum field. The actual field responsible\nfor producing the primordial perturbations is a combination\nof the inflaton and the scalar component of the metric fluctuations, but we shall simplify the picture somewhat by treating\nthis combination as a pure unparticle. The quantum fluctuations continually occur during the slowly rolling phase and\nare stretched to vast scales, whereupon they become essentially frozen into the space-time background. The simplest\nmeasure of this pattern, which provides the initial input used\nto describe a variety of features of our universe, is the twopoint function or equivalently its Fourier transform, the power\nspectrum, Pk (\u03b7 ). For an unparticle inflaton, these quantities\nare defined by\nh0|\u03c3 (\u03b7 ,~x)\u03c3 (\u03b7 ,~y)|0i =\n\n1\nAd\nad (\u03b7 )ad (\u03b7 \u2032 ) 2\u03c0\nZ \u221e\n0\n\n2\n\n2 d\u22122 e\n\ndM (M )\n\n\u2212i(\u03b7 \u2212\u03b7 \u2032 )\n\n\u221a\n\nM2 +k2 \u2212i\u03b5\n\n\u221a\n.

Then, even a small\nvalue of n is usually sufficient to prevent the unparticles from\noverwhelming the usual flat power spectrum produced by the\ninflaton. This section examines the leading indirect role that\nunparticles can have on the production of the primordial perturbations in inflation through their loop corrections.\nThe power spectrum for the inflaton is defined exactly as\nbefore,\nh0(\u03b7 )|\u03c6 (\u03b7 ,~x)\u03c6 (\u03b7 ,~y)|0(\u03b7 )i\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\nd 3~k i~k*(~x\u2212~y) 2\u03c0 2\n=\ne\nPk (\u03b7 ) ,\n(2\u03c0 )3\nk3\n\nUNPARTICLES IN RADIATIVE CORRECTIONS\n\nAlthough we mentioned in the beginning that unparticles\nprovide just one example of how nature might surprise us,\nthey are actually not so exotic when compared with other possibilities. Unparticles can even arise from a particle theory\nwith the right properties. As an example, consider a setting\nwhere at very high energies we have three sorts of particles:\nthe inflaton, some proto-unparticles, and a heavy particle of\nmass M that interacts with the other two. At energies below\nM, we can integrate out the heavy particles to generate interactions between the inflaton and the proto-unparticles, suppressed by some power of 1/M. If the proto-unparticles have a\nsuitable infrared fixed point, at still lower energies the protounparticles will be replaced by an effective theory of unparticles with an associated dimensional transmutation scale \u039b.\nAssembling all of these ingredients together, the typical effective interaction between the inflaton, \u03c6 , and the unparticles, \u03c3 ,\nwill have the form,\n\u0012 \u0013n\n4\u2212r\u2212sd \u039b\nc\u039b\n\u03c6 r\u03c3 s,\n(4.1)\nM\nwhere c is a dimensionless coupling constant and n, r, and s\nare some integers. In an inflationary setting, the Hubble scale\nH is a low energy scale, at least with respect to the dynamics\nthat produced the unparticles. This observation implies that\nwe have the following hierarchy of scales,\nH < \u039b < M.\nA.\n\n(4.2)\n\nLeading particle-unparticle interactions\n\nEven if the inflaton is not itself an unparticle, the presence\nof unparticles during inflation can still influence the pattern\nof primordial perturbations. The leading influence will be\nthrough the most relevant, or lowest dimension, operators. As\nbefore, let us denote the inflaton, now an ordinary particle, by\n\u03c6 and assume that its potential remains invariant when we replace \u03c6 with \u2212\u03c6 .

Any potential divergences can have one of two\ndistinct origins. First, there may simply be a standard shortdistance divergence which corresponds to a need to renormalize the inflaton in the presence of unparticle interactions. The\nsecond sort of divergence may result from the fact that we\ncannot completely neglect the mass of the inflaton or size of a\nmode at the end of inflation. The possibility of a divergence as\nx \u2192 0 is the most interesting, since it means that the loop correction has a non-negligible dependence on k, which would\nprovide a distinct observable signature.\nThree of the regions within the range of integration in \u03a0(0)\ncan be characterized as short-distance limits: q \u2192 \u221e, short\nspatial separations, x\u2032\u2032 \u2192 x\u2032 , coincident internal times, and x\u2032 ,\nx\u2032\u2032 \u2192 \u221e, an arbitrarily early initial time. This last case might\nnot appear to be a short-distance limit, but we should remember that as we proceed into the past, physical lengths become\never smaller, and thus they are infinitesimally tiny in the infinite past. Each of these limits is completely safe-that is,\nno divergences occur-as long as d < 2. We can verify this\nbehavior by expanding the integrand in \u03a0(0) explicitly, but it\nis perhaps more instructive and simpler to look at the analogous calculation of the correction in flat space, which is done\nin Appendix A. This appendix shows that the loop correction\nin a Minkowski background is completely finite and does not\nrequire the renormalization of the inflaton that would be required for a particle loop. At short distances, the curvature of\nde Sitter space should become negligible-we earlier chose\nour modes to be precisely those that matched with the flatspace modes in this same limit-so there should not be any\nshort distance divergences in \u03a0(0) either.\nThe second group of divergences are long-distance ones:\nq \u2192 0, q \u2192 1 and x\u2032 , x\u2032\u2032 \u223c x \u2192 0. Because q = p/k and because\nwe have chosen the loop momentum so that ~p runs through the\nunparticle leg and ~k \u2212 ~p runs through the inflaton leg, q = 0\nand q = 1 correspond respectively to having a vanishing momentum in the virtual unparticle or the virtual inflaton. As\nlong as d is positive, a soft unparticle does not produce any\ndivergences. However, a soft inflaton does yield a mild logarithmic divergence; near q = 1 we have\n\u03a0(0) =\n\nZ 1+\u03b5\n\n1\u2212\u03b5\nZ \u221e\n\n1\n|q \u2212 1|\n\u0003Z\ndx\u2032 \u0002\nsin(x)\n\u2212\nx\ncos(x)\n\u2032 4\u2212d\ndq\n\nx\nx\nh0\n\u2032\u2032 \u2212ix\u2032\u2032 (2)\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\n[1 + ix ]e\nH 3 [(x \u2212 x )]\nd\u2212 2\n\n\u221e\n\ndx\u2032\u2032\nx\u2032\u2032 4\u2212d\n\n3\n\n(x\u2032\u2032 \u2212 x\u2032 ) 2 \u2212d\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n(1)\n[(x\u2032\u2032 \u2212 x\u2032 )]\nd\u2212 23\n\n+[1 \u2212 ix\u2032\u2032]eix H\n+***.\n\ni\n\n(4.35)\n\nWe mentioned earlier that a massless inflaton is not well defined in a de Sitter background, so this divergence should be\ncured by including a small mass m for this field, so that here\n\u03b5 \u223c m/k or\n\u03a0(0) \u223c ln\n\nm\n+ ***.\nk\n\n(4.36)\n\nThere remains only the case where x\u2032 and x\u2032\u2032 are small.

The power spectrum for the\n\n\f8\nprimordial perturbations inferred from the precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation [9] is\nnearly flat, with perhaps a little more power at long wavelengths than at smaller ones. Unitarity [3] already requires\nthat d > 1, so that for scaling dimensions where d < 32 , where\nthe power spectrum scales as k2d , unparticles do not produce\na flat spectrum. Beyond d > 32 , the power spectrum becomes\npoorly defined since the Wightman function diverges at coincident times for such scaling dimensions. Because of its\nconformal properties, the flat-space propagator for an unparticle is closely related to that of a conformally flat background;\nso this divergence applies equally well to unparticles in flat\nspace.\nAn unparticle is much more useful as an additional ingredient in the standard inflationary picture. As an example, the\nloop correction produced when an unparticle interacts with a\nscalar inflaton particle tends to add to the long wavelength end\nof the power spectrum. We analyzed the loop correction due\nto a cubic coupling between the inflaton and an unparticle; we\nfound that its leading behavior scales as (k\u03b7 )2d\u22123 . For modes\nstretched well outside the horizon during inflation, for which\nk\u03b7 \u2192 0, this term becomes negligible for d > 23 but below\nthree-halves, it enhances the power in the large-wavelength\nmodes.\nAlthough we have been primarily interested in the properties of unparticles in an inflationary setting, along the way we\nhave learned a few more general things about them that also\napply to flat space. Aside from the divergence in the Wightman function just mentioned, the behavior of unparticles is\nin some ways tamer than that of ordinary particles. Simple\nloop corrections that contain only particles usually diverge.\nThese divergences arise form the large momentum region of\nthe loop integral and they are canceled by renormalizing some\naspect of the theory. Unparticles in loops tend to be free of\nthese short-distance divergences, as is shown for a few examples in the following appendix. This observation suggests that\nunparticles can be useful as a method for regularizing conformal particle theories, particularly for massless fermions-\nprovided their unparticle analogues exist-since such a conformal regularization does not require breaking or extending\nany of the space-time symmetries.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported in part by DOE grant No. DE-FG0391-ER40682, by the EU FP6 Marie Curie Research and Training Network \"UniverseNet\" (MRTN-CT-2006-035863), and\nby the Niels Bohr International Academy.\n\niA(k )\n2\n\n\u0011\n\n...\n..\n\n..\n.....\n\n......... .....\n...\n.......\n\n.....\n...\n\n...\n..\n..\n..\n.\n...........................................................................................\n.\n....................................................................................................................................................................................\n\nk\n\nk\n\nFIG. 2: A loop correction to the particle \u03c6 propagator (solid line)\nfrom an unparticle \u03c3 (dashed line) from a \u03c6 2 \u03c3 interaction.\n\ndenote the flat-space unparticle field by \u03c7 and the ordinary-\nnow massive (m)-particle field by \u03c6 .\n1.

As a technical point, the calculation proceeds most simply if we begin\nwith the unparticle propagator in the form given in Eq.

The nonintegral scaling dimension\nof the field naturally avoids poles in the \u0393-functions that result\nfrom this last integral. As a consequence, unparticles when\ncoupled as above do not require any renormalization of the\nparticle field.

We can therefore use an unparticle as a way to regulate a massless particle, while preserving the underlying 3 + 1\ndimensional Lorentz invariance of the theory.6\nFor example, starting with a massless particle \u03c7 coupled to\na massive one, \u03c6 , by c\u039b\u03c6 2 \u03c7 , evaluating the loop in 4 \u2212 2\u03b4\ndimensions yields\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ 1\nxm2 \u2212 x(1 \u2212 x)k2 \u2212 i\u03b5\nc 2 \u039b2 1\n\u2212 \u03b3 +ln 4\u03c0 \u2212 dx ln\n.\nAdr =\n16\u03c0 2 \u03b4\n\u03bc2\n0\n(A6)\nComparing with an unparticle coupling c\u039b\u03bc 1\u2212d \u03c6 2 \u03c7 , the amplitude in the small \u03b4 limit-where now d = 1 + \u03b4 -is\n\u0014\nc 2 \u039b2\n1\nAun =\n\u2212 \u2212 2\u03b3 \u2212 1 + 2 ln4\u03c0\n2\n16\u03c0\n\u03b4\n\u0015\nZ 1\nxm2 \u2212 x(1 \u2212 x)k2 \u2212 i\u03b5\n; (A7)\ndx ln\n\u2212\n\u03bc2\n0\n\nZ 1\n\nWe conclude with one last example, where this time the\ncubic coupling is\nc\u2032 \u039b3\u22122d\n\n\u039b\nM\n\n\u03c6\u03c3 2 .\n\n(A8)\n\nThe calculation proceeds as before so we shall be a bit briefer.\nThe amplitude associated with the unparticle loop shown in\nFig. 3 is\n\u00132n\u2032\n\n\u0393(2 \u2212 2d)\n(\u2212k2 \u2212 i\u03b5 )2d\u22122.\n\u0393(2d)\n(A9)\nNotice that we still have the divergence at d = 1 as well as a\nnew divergence when d = 32 , where \u0393(2 \u2212 2d) \u2192 \u221e.\nA \u2032 (k2 ) =\n\nc\u2032 2 \u039b2(3\u22122d)\n\n(16\u03c0 2 )2d\u22121\n\n\u0012\n\n\u039b\nM\n\ne\u2212i|~p\u2212k|(\u03b7 \u2212\u03b7\n|~p \u2212~k|n\n~\n\ndz\n\n\u22121\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032 )\n\n(B1)\n\nwhere z \u2261 cos \u03b8 is related to the angle between the loop momentum ~p and the external momentum ~k.
