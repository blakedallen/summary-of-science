Of particular interest\nin semiconductors are mechanisms that allow these tasks to be completed solely by\nelectrical means, since mature electronic technologies may potentially then be leveraged\nto implement spin-based devices.1 Current-induced spin polarization (CISP) is one such\nphenomenon in which the charge carriers of a semiconductor become spin polarized as a\ncurrent is made to flow through the material. In experiments characterizing CISP in bulk\nfilms, an electrical bias is applied across a semiconductor channel, which then causes a\nspin polarization to be generated along an axis that is in the plane of the film and\nperpendicular to the direction of current flow. The spin polarization generated is spatially\nuniform throughout the channel rather than accumulating only at the channel edges as it\ndoes in the spin Hall effect.\nAlthough CISP has been observed in a number of two-2,3,4 and three-5,6\ndimensional systems, its physical origins are not well understood. Spin-orbit coupling\n(SOC) is often used to explain the source of the spin polarization, but models that rely on\nSOC caused by electric fields within devices have not fully explained measurements in\nbulk epilayers. Others have suggested that charge carriers may become spin-polarized\neven in systems where SOC is absent,7 but measurements of CISP so far have been in\ndevices where spin-orbit interactions are relatively large. In an effort to more fully\nunderstand the role of spin-orbit interactions in CISP, we investigate the phenomenon in\nbulk n-type gallium nitride (GaN), a III-V system with significant technological interest\nfor which SOC is expected to be small.8\n\n2\n\n\fThe n-type GaN epilayers under study include a series of three grown via plasmaassisted molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) (samples A, B, and C) and a fourth grown via\nmetalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) (sample D). The MBE growths were\ndeposited on semi-insulating 4H-SiC substrates under gallium rich conditions,9 and a\npreviously developed two-step buffer growth method was used10 in which an initial 50\nnm AlN nucleation layer was followed by a nominally-undoped 100 nm layer of GaN.\nAfter this, a final 515 nm n-type GaN layer was deposited which was doped with Si to\nachieve carrier concentrations of 4.5e17, 1.1e18, and 1.5e18 cm-3 for samples A, B, and\nC respectively. The MOCVD growth began with a thin, low-temperature seed layer of\nGaN grown on sapphire,11 followed by two compensation-doped GaN:Fe buffer layers of\ntotal thickness 850 nm.12 A nominally-undoped 550 nm buffer layer of GaN was then\ndeposited, after which a 1000 nm Si-doped active layer was grown that was measured to\nhave a carrier concentration of 4.14e17 cm-3. The dislocation densities of the MBE and\nMOCVD growths were measured via x-ray diffraction to be ~2e10 cm-2 and ~1e9 cm-2\nrespectively.13\nHall bar devices were fabricated along both the [112\u03040] and [11\u030400] directions of\neach sample with a reactive ion etch, after which ohmic contact pads with a Ti/Al/Ni/Au\nlayer structure were deposited and subjected to a rapid thermal anneal at 870 \u00b0C for 30\nseconds in N2.14 A Hall bar geometry, shown in Fig. 1(a), was chosen over a simpler\ndesign with only two contacts so that any device heating under an electrical bias could be\nquantified via measurements of the device resistance.\nDevices were mounted in the variable temperature insert of a magneto-optical\ncryostat with the device channel parallel to the external magnetic field. An alternating\n\n3\n\n\fsquare wave electrical bias with a frequency of 1307Hz was applied across the channel\nand varied between 0 and 20 Volts peak-to-peak, the latter of which corresponds to an\nelectric field in the channel of roughly 66.7 mV/\u03bcm. We measured time-resolved Kerr\nrotation (TRKR) in the Voigt geometry to determine the electron spin coherence time\n(T2*) and g-factor (g) of each device as a function of temperature (T) and electric field\n(E).15 The output from a mode-locked pulsed Ti:sapphire laser was frequency-doubled\nand split into a 1.5 mW circularly-polarized pump beam and a 0.15 mW linearlypolarized probe beam. These beams were focused onto the sample with a spot diameter\nof ~19 \u03bcm, and their wavelength ranged from 355.5 nm to 364.5 nm depending on T.\nThe g-factor was found to be insensitive to T, E, and doping density, and on\naverage was measured to be g = 1.96\u00b10.04. In addition, at T = 50 K, B = 0.125 T, and E\n= 0 mV/\u03bcm, T2* was measured to be 978 \u00b1 67, 238 \u00b1 11, 169 \u00b1 12, and 579 \u00b1 21 ps for\nsamples A,B,C, and D respectively. In sample A, T2* at T = 300 K was measured to be\n104 \u00b1 15 ps when B = 0.5 T and E = 0 mV/\u03bcm. This is a factor of three larger than the\nvalue of 35 ps reported in a previous study of bulk n-GaN,16 and brings this figure of\nmerit for GaN into the same order of magnitude as that seen in bulk n-type ZnO (190\nps)17 and GaAs (110 ps).18 This is despite having a dislocation density that is many\norders of magnitude larger than that of state-of-the-art bulk GaAs.19\nWe then investigated whether CISP could be observed in any of the four GaN\nsamples. We blocked the pump beam in our setup to avoid polarizing spins optically,\nincreased the probe power to 1.5 mW, and measured the resultant KR signal via a single\nlockin referenced to the frequency of the electrical bias. The KR measured is\nproportional to the time-averaged projection of spin polarization along the direction of\n\n4\n\n\fprobe propagation. If spin polarization is generated along y (Fig. 1(a)), the combined\neffects of spin precession and decoherence result in plots of KR vs. magnetic field having\nan odd-Lorentzian lineshape determined by the equation:\n\u03b8K = \u03b8el\u03c9L\u03c4/((\u03c9L\u03c4)2+1)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c9L = g\u03bcBB/\u0127 is the Larmor precession frequency, \u03bcB is the Bohr magneton, \u0127 is the\nPlank constant, \u03c4 is the inhomogeneous transverse spin lifetime, and \u03b8el is the magnitude\nof the electrically generated KR angle.5\nAt T = 50 K, CISP was observed in samples A and D, but not in B or C. We then\ncharacterized CISP as a function of E and T in samples A and D. A typical measurement\nof CISP in GaN can be seen in Fig. 1(b). For each value of E, a scan such as this was\ntaken and then fit to Eq. (1) using the value of g found from TRKR measurements taken\nunder the same experimental conditions. From this, values for |\u03b8el| and \u03c4 were extracted.\nThe polarity of \u03b8el could not be determined because attempts to measure nuclear\npolarization in the epilayers were unsuccessful. Plots of |\u03b8el| and \u03c4 as a function of E\nacross the [11\u030400] devices of samples A and D are shown in Fig. 2 for several different\ntemperatures. Large error bars are due to a small signal-to-noise ratio, as the change in\nKR measured at low biases and high temperatures was often close to the resolution of our\nsetup (~80nrad). The signal was in general stronger in sample D, and data from sample\nA where E < 20 mV/\u03bcm and T > 50 K could not be fit because the signal dropped below\nthe noise floor. In both samples at all temperatures, |\u03b8el| increases with E, indicating that\nmore charge carriers become spin polarized as the bias is raised.\nAt 50 K, \u03c4 decreases dramatically as a function of E in both samples. As T is\nraised this behavior becomes progressively less pronounced so that at the highest\n\n5\n\n\ftemperatures \u03c4 does not vary with E at all. In Fig. 3(a-b) we plot T2* as a function of E\nand T as measured via TRKR and compare with the appropriate plots of \u03c4 in Fig. 2. T2*\nexhibits the same behavior as \u03c4 in both samples at 50 K, while at higher temperatures it\nremains essentially constant in E. In sample D, the similarity between T2* and \u03c4 is\nparticularly striking, as they remain close in magnitude throughout the data set. The\nelectronic mobility of the material is low (~100 cm2/V*s for sample A at 50 K), and\nspatially-resolved TRKR measurements revealed no distortion of optically-induced spin\npackets under electrical biases. Therefore, the behavior of T2* at 50 K is not due to spin\ntransport effects, which suggests that device heating is largely responsible for the\ndecrease in both T2* and \u03c4 as a function of E at low temperatures. Measurements of\ndevice resistance taken at each value of T and E corroborate this picture. Using device\nresistance as a proxy for device temperature, the heating in sample A at 50 K and E =\n66.7 mV/\u03bcm was found to be ~35 K. This is reasonable considering that devices on\nsample A are ~20 k\u03a9 at 50 K and zero bias. In Fig. 3(c) we plot T2* as a function of T at\nzero bias for samples A and D and see that the projected value of T2* at 85 K is in rough\nagreement with the value measured at T = 50 K and E = 66.7 mV/\u03bcm. From further\nanalysis of transport and T2* data we find that heating in sample A is less than 9 K at 100\nK and less than 6 K above 150 K, and that heating is similar in sample D.\nThe exact relationship between SOC and CISP is unclear. Previous attempts to\nassociate CISP in bulk epilayers with a Rashba-like strain-induced spin splitting have\nbeen unsuccessful.5 In (110) AlGaAs quantum wells, CISP was argued to be the result of\nDresselhaus SOC exclusively,2 while in other two-dimensional systems, Rashba SOC\nwas invoked to explain the effect.3,4 Most recently, CISP was observed in ZnSe at\n\n6\n\n\ftemperatures of up to 295 K even though no SO effective magnetic fields were measured\nwithin the material.6 GaN is a material for which SOC coefficients are predicted to be\nsmall. In particular, the k-cubic Dresselhaus coefficient has been calculated via a Kanetype k*p model to be 0.32 eV*\u00c53,8 while measurements in AlGaN/GaN two-dimensional\nelectron gases indicate that the upper bound for the Rashba coefficient is in the range of\n~1-3e*\u00c52.20,21 Despite small SOC coefficients, CISP can be clearly resolved in the\nmaterial at temperatures of up to 200 K. Furthermore, the data in Fig. 2 behave similarly\nto that of previous studies of [11\u03040] InGaAs channels,5 suggesting that the mechanism\nbehind CISP in GaN is similar in nature to that of previously explored bulk materials.\nNo changes in |\u03b8el| or \u03c4 were observed when CISP was characterized in devices\noriented along the [112\u03040] direction. This is in contrast to previous results in InGaAs, for\nwhich |\u03b8el| varied strongly in devices oriented 90\u00b0 relative to one-another. It is possible\nthat this discrepancy could be due to the difference in symmetries of Dresselhaus SOC in\nwurtzite and zinc blende materials. The relative polarity of zinc blende Dresselhaus and\nRashba fields for electron spins travelling along the [110] direction is opposite that of\nspins moving along the [11\u03040] axis.22 However, in wurtzite materials, Dresselhaus and\nRashba terms possess the same symmetry for electron spins travelling in any direction\nparallel to the c-plane.8 A more detailed study of the crystallographic dependence of\nCISP in wurtzite GaN is needed to determine whether this is in fact what is occurring.\nAbove 200 K, both \u03b8el and \u03c4 become very small, so that the odd-Lorentzian\nlineshape characteristic of CISP becomes broad and flat and therefore experimentally\ndifficult to resolve. However, the high dislocation densities of GaN limit the spin\ncoherence times of the material,23 and high-purity GaN is predicted to possess electron\n\n7\n\n\fspin coherence times about two orders of magnitude larger than those of GaAs at room\ntemperature, in part due to the weak SOC of the material.24 Therefore, with further\ndevelopment of growth techniques, it is possible that the observation of CISP in GaN\nmay be extended to even higher temperatures.\nWe thank ARO and ONR for financial support.

B and E are parallel to the channel for all measurements. (b) \u03b8K as a function of B\nfor n-GaN at 50 K with E = 66.7 mV \u03bcm-1. Channel is oriented along the [11\u030400] axis of\nsample D. Black circles are data while the blue line is a fit to Eq. (1).\n\nFIG. 2. Electric field dependence of |\u03b8el| and \u03c4 at various temperatures in devices\noriented along [11\u030400] in samples A and D. (a) |\u03b8el| and (b) \u03c4 as extracted from fits to data\ntaken in sample D at 50 K (black squares), 100 K (red circles), and 150 K (blue upturned\ntriangles). (c) |\u03b8el| and (d) \u03c4 from sample A at 50 K (black squares). (e) |\u03b8el| and (f) \u03c4\nfrom sample A at 100 K (red circles), 150 K (blue upturned triangles), and 200 K (green\ndownturned triangles). 50 K data from sample A plotted separately because larger scale\nis needed for \u03c4.\n\nFIG. 3. Electric field dependence of T2* as measured in devices oriented along [11\u030400] in\nsamples (a) A and (b) D at 50 K (black squares), 100 K (red circles), 150 K (blue\nupturned triangles), and 200 K (green downturned triangles). (c) T2* as a function of\ntemperature in samples A (black symbols) and D (red symbols). From fits to TRKR data\ntaken at B = 0.125 T (squares), 0.25 T (circles), 0.5 T (upturned triangles), and 1.0 T\n\n12\n\n\f(downturned triangles). (d) \u03b8K as a function of B for n-GaN at 200 K. Channel is oriented\nalong the [11\u030400] axis of sample A and E = 66.7 mV \u03bcm-1. Black circles are data while\nthe blue line is a fit to Eq. (1). \u03b8K measurement error is roughly equal to point scatter in\ndata.\n\n13\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\nw = 125 \u03bcm\ny\nx\nl = 300 \u03bcm\n\n\u03b8K (\u03bcrad)\n\nE // B\n\n0.5 T = 50 K\n-1\n66.7 mV \u03bcm\n \u0304\nE // [1100]\n0.0\n\n-0.5\n\nz\n\n-0.1\n\n0.0\nB (T)\n\nSample D\n0.1\n\n\f(a) 1.0\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n20\n40\n60\n-1\nE (mV \u03bcm )\n\n(d)10000\n50 K\n7500\n\u03c4 (ps)\n\n0.6\n\n5000\n2500\n\n0.2\n\n0\n0\n\n20\n40\n60\n-1\nE (mV \u03bcm )\n\n(e) 1.0\n\nSample A\n0.8 E // [1100]\n \u0304\n\n0.4\n\n20\n40\n60\n-1\nE (mV \u03bcm )\n\n(f) 800\n600\n\u03c4 (ps)\n\n0.6\n\n100 K\n150 K\n200 K\n\n400\n200\n\n0.2\n0.0\n0\n\n400\n\n0\n0\n\n20\n40\n60\n-1\nE (mV \u03bcm )\n\nSample A\n0.8 E // [1100]\n \u0304\n\n0.0\n0\n\n50 K\n100 K\n150 K\n\n200\n\n(c) 1.0\n|\u03b8el| (\u03bcrad)\n\n600\n\n0.2\n0.0\n0\n\n|\u03b8el| (\u03bcrad)\n\n(b) 800\n\n\u03c4 (ps)\n\n|\u03b8el| (\u03bcrad)\n\nSample D\n0.8 E // [1100]\n \u0304\n\n20\n40\n60\n-1\nE (mV \u03bcm )\n\n0\n0\n\n20\n40\n60\n-1\nE (mV \u03bcm )\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\n0\n0\n\n(c)\n1000\n\n*\n\nT2 (ps)\n\nT2 (ps)\n\n*\n\n250\n\n-1\n\n500\n\n500\n\n0\n0\n\n20\n40\n60\n-1\nE (mV \u03bcm )\nE = 0 mV \u03bcm\nBlack = Sample A\nRed = Sample D\n\nSample A\n \u0304\nE // [1100]\n\n1000\n\n20\n40\n60\n-1\nE (mV \u03bcm )\n\n(d)\n\n\u03b8K (\u03bcrad)\n\n*\n\nT2 (ps)\n\n500\n\nSample D\n \u0304\nE // [1100]\n\n0.1 T = 200 K -1\n66.7 mV \u03bcm\n \u0304\nE // [1100]\n0.0\n\n-0.1\n\n0\n\n50 100 150 200 250 300\nT (K)\n\n-0.5\n\n0.0\nB (T)\n\nSample A\n0.5\n\n\f"}
