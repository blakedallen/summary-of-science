Their presence in the nascent solar system is inferred from an excess of their daughter\nisotopes in meteorite components (Russell, Gounelle & Hutchison 2001). Some SRs [10 Be\n(T1/2 = 1.5 Myr), 26 Al (T1/2 = 0.74 Myr), 36 Cl (T1/2 = 0.30 Myr), 41 Ca (T1/2 = 0.10 Myr),\n53\nMn (T1/2 = 3.7 Myr), 60 Fe (T1/2 = 1.5 Myr)] were present in the protoplanetary disk at\nabundances substantially higher than the levels expected for average interstellar medium\n(Meyer & Clayton 2000). These SRs cannot therefore be inherited from the interstellar\nmedium and require a last minute origin (e.g. Wadhwa et al. 2007). The origin of SRs is\nhighly debated in the cosmochemistry community, because it has important consequences\nfor e.g. early solar system chronology (e.g. McKeegan & Davis 2004; Gounelle & Russell\n2005a,b) and planetesimal heating (Urey 1955; Ghosh & McSeen 1998). In addition, understanding the origin of SRs will provide key constraints on the astrophysical environment in\nwhich our solar system was born (e.g. Hester & Desch 2005; Goswami et al. 2005; Gounelle\n2006).\nGenerally speaking, SRs can be made either by thermal nucleosynthesis, at KeV energies\nin the interior of stars, or by non-thermal nucleosynthesis, i.e. nuclear reactions involving\ncosmic rays or accelerated particles at MeV energy from the Sun. There are therefore two\npossible sources for short-lived radionuclides in the solar protoplanetary disk: (a) Injection\ninto the molecular cloud core or protoplanetary disk from a nearby, late-type star (e.g. Busso,\nGallino & Wasserburg 2003), (b) In situ production in the protoplanetary disk by irradiation\nof dust and gas with accelerated particles from the proto-Sun (e.g. Gounelle et al. 2006).\nWe focus here on the possible delivery of SRs by a late type star. Asymptotic Giant\nBranch (AGB) stars are possible candidates (Wasserburg et al. 2006), but this source of SRs\nin the early solar system is considered highly unlikely because of the low probability of an\nencounter between an AGB star and a star forming region (Kastner & Myers 1994). Type II\nsupernovae represent an alternative to AGB stars as a source of SRs (Cameron et al. 1995).\nOf models based on a supernova (SN) origin for SRs there are two types. Either a SN\ninjects freshly synthesized SRs into a nearby molecular cloud core, triggering its gravitational\ncollapse (Cameron & Truran 1977; Cameron et al. 1995; Boss & Vanhala 2000), or directly\ninto a nearby protoplanetary disk (Chevalier 2000; Hester & Desch 2005; Ouellette et al.\n2005). The first SN scenario is now considered less likely because only very specific conditions\nallow a supernova shockwave to trigger the collapse of a molecular cloud core and, at the\nsame time, inject SRs (e.g. Boss & Vanhala 2000). In the second scenario, which is currently\nreceiving a lot of attention (Chevalier 2000; Hester & Desch 2005; Ouellette et al. 2005;\nOuellette, Desch & Hester 2007), the SN has to be very close (\u223c 0.3 pc) to the protoplanetary\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\ndisk in order to allow the disk to intercept enough SN ejecta to account for the solar system\ninventory of SRs. It is thus assumed that the massive star, which evolved into a SN, and\nthe protoplanetary disk were coeval and formed in the same stellar cluster (e.g. Hester &\nDesch 2005). Massive stars form in large stellar clusters (Lada & Lada 2003). The nearby\nSN injection model therefore implies that our Sun was born in a large stellar cluster. The\nOrion Nebula Cluster (ONC) is often cited as a good analog for such an environment (Hester\n& Desch 2005).\nHowever, if the Sun was born in a stellar cluster massive enough to contain a SN, it\nhas important implications for the childhood of our solar system. Massive stars are known\nto power winds carving large bubbles of hot gas in surrounding cold molecular gas (Weaver\net al. 1977). They also emit large UV fluxes, which create HII blisters in cold molecular\ngas (O'Dell 2001) and photoevaporate nearby protoplanetary disks (e.g. Johnstone, Bally\n& Hollenbach 1998). The presence of numerous massive stars close to planetary systems\ncan also dynamically modify the orbits of the giant planets and of Kuiper Belt Objects (e.g.\nAdams & Laughlin 2001). It is therefore essential to evaluate the a priori probability of our\nSun to be born in such an harsh astrophysical setting.\nAdams & Laughlin (2001) estimated the probability of the Sun to have been born in a\nstellar environment large enough to contain a massive star (which could deliver SRs via a\nSN explosion) and small enough to preserve both the orbits of the giant planets as well as\nthose of the Kuiper belt objects. These authors made the assumption that any star more\nmassive than 25 M\u2299 was able to deliver SRs to the solar protoplanetary disk, and they did\nnot place constraints on the time window during which SRs were injected into the disk. The\nspatial structure of the cluster was not included in this model. Subsequently, Williams &\nGaidos (2007) provided an estimate for the probability of the nearby SN injection scenario.\nHowever this estimate did not take quantitatively into account the disk photoevaporation and\noverestimated the time window during which SN injection of SRs in a nearby protoplanetary\ndisk can occur.\nThe present work is organized as follows. First, we review the cosmochemical constraints\non the origin of SRs (\u00a72). Second, we present recent observations and models of molecular\ncloud dynamics, star formation rate, accretion disk lifetime and evolutionary timescales of\nmassive stars pertinent to an evaluation of the proposed ONC-like setting for the formation\nof the solar system (\u00a73). Third, we calculate the probability for a protoplanetary disk\nattached to a low-mass star to receive SRs from a nearby SN at the levels inferred for the\nearly solar system, with the necessary constraints that SR delivery happens within the time\nwindow specified by the cosmochemical data, and that the disk is not destroyed by UV\nphotoevaporation (\u00a74). Our model assumptions and limitations are discussed in section\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n\u00a75. In section \u00a76 we present the implications of our findings for the origin of short-lived\nradionuclides.\n\n2.\n\nPolluting our protoplanetary disk with a SN ejecta: Timing and distance\n\nAmong the SRs that could have been delivered by a supernova to the protoplanetary\ndisk around the young Sun, 26 Al provides the strongest constraint on the timing of such\nan event (e.g. Wadhwa et al. 2007; Russell et al. 2006). Aluminium-26 is more abundant\nin primitive chondrite components, such as Calcium-, Aluminium-rich Inclusions (CAIs)\nand chondrules (e.g. Galy et al. 2000) than in more evolved asteroidal crustal rocks (e.g.\nSrinivasan et al. 1999). CAIs have the oldest measured Pb-Pb ages of any solid matter in\nthe solar system (Bouvier et al. 2007). Some iron meteorites, believed to sample the cores\nof differentiated asteroids, have model Hf-W ages as old as those of CAIs (Markowski et\nal. 2006). They must therefore have formed contemporaneously with CAIs. This implies\nthat 26 Al, which is believed to have been the main heat source responsible for asteroidal\ndifferentiation, was present in the protoplanetary disk already at the time of iron meteorite\nparent-asteroid accretion (Bottke et al. 2006). Both observations suggest that 26 Al was\npresent in the protoplanetary disk from the early stages of its evolution, certainly as far\nback in time as the meteorite record can bring us (e.g. Wadhwa et al. 2007; Russell et al.\n2006). Although the exact timescale is not known, it is reasonable to assume that if 26 Al\nwas delivered to the solar system from a SN source, this injection occurred during the class\n0 or class I stage of our protoSun (e.g. Montmerle et al. 2006). The combined duration of\nthe class 0 and class I phases is \u223c 105 yr. Here we will conservatively assume that the SN\ndelivery of SRs to the protoplanetary disk occurred within a time interval, \u0398, of \u223c 1 Myr\nafter the formation of the disk (see also Ouellette et al. 2005; Looney, Tobin & Fields 2006).\nThe distance r between the SN and the protoplanetary disk cannot be too small, otherwise the disk will be destroyed by the impact of the ejecta. Nor can this distance be too\nlarge because this would limit the amount of injected SRs. There is a restricted distance\ninterval, the 'minimum' (rmin ) and the 'maximum' (rmax ) acceptable distance between the\nSN and protoplanetary disk, referred to as the 'enrichment zone', which satisfies these two\nimportant constraints.\nChevalier (2000) estimated that at distances smaller than 0.25 pc, momentum transfer\nbetween the SN ejecta and the disk will cause the later to be stripped away. Based on 2D\nnumerical simulations, Ouellette, Desch & Hester (2007) concluded that a disk as close as\n0.1 pc from a 25 M\u2299 SN can survive disruption. For the minimum distance, rmin, we will\nadopt a conservative value of 0.1 pc.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nThe maximum distance rmax , below which the protoplanetary disk receives enough SRs\nto account for solar system abundances depends on a limited number of parameters. Though\nit is beyond the scope of the present paper to explicitly derive rmax , we indicate how it can\nbe calculated and summarize the estimates given by several groups (Ouellette et al. 2005;\nLooney, Tobin & Fields 2006).\nFor any radionuclide, the mixing fraction, f , of the supernova ejecta mixed into the\nprotoplanetary disk is:\nMSS\nf=\n\u00d7 e\u2206/\u03c4 ,\n(1)\n\u03b7YSN\nwhere MSS is the initial mass of the radionuclide in the solar system (in M\u2299 ), YSN is the\ntotal yield of the radionuclide from the considered supernova (in M\u2299 ), \u03c4 is the mean life, \u03b7\nthe injection efficiency and \u2206 is the time interval between the end of nucleosynthesis in the\nsupernova and incorporation into refractory meteorite components (CAIs). Note that f \u226a 1\nas MSS \u226a YSN and \u2206 \u2248 \u03c4 (see below). Following Cameron\np et al. (1995), we translate the\nr0\nmixing fraction f into a geometrical relationship, r = 2 1/f , where r0 is the size of the\ndisk and r the distance between the disk and the massive star. Putting these two expressions\ntogether, we obtain the general expression:\nr\nr0\nYSN \u2212\u2206/\u03c4\ne\n.\n(2)\nr=\n\u03b7\n2\nMSS\nMSS is estimated from the disk mass, the solar abundances and the initial abundance\nof the considered radionuclide identified to that of CAIs (e.g. Gounelle & Meibom 2007).\nUsing SN yields calculated by state-of-the art nucleosynthetic models corresponding to a\nlarge range of progenitor masses and metallicities (Rauscher et al. 2002; Woosley & Weaver\n1995), and assuming an injection efficiency of 1, Looney, Tobin & Fields (2006) as well as\nOuellette et al. (2005) calculate that the solar protoplanetary disk had to be at a distance\nbetween 0.02 and 0.3 pc from the massive star for disk sizes varying between 30 and 100\nAU. \u2206 is constrained by the decay of short-lived radionuclides and is of the order of \u223c 1\nMyr. Note that the disk size cannot be significantly larger than 100 AU because, before any\ninjection occurs, the disk has been sitting nearby a strongly ionizing O star for some Myr (see\nsection 3), resulting in severe disk truncation (Ouellette et al. 2005). The alternative case of\nlarger disks examined by Looney, Tobin & Fields (2006) is therefore not relevant here. For\nmore realistic values of \u03b7 (i.e. \u03b7 \u226a 1) the injection distance is reduced to values approaching\nthe minimum acceptable distance (0.1 pc), which would cause a problem with regard to\ndisk survivability. We will consider here that a generous maximum distance between the\nprotoplanetary disk and the supernova is rmax = 0.4 pc.\nTherefore, the acceptable distance interval for which the SN explosion delivers SRs at\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nthe level observed in the solar system, but does not destroy the protoplanetary disk is quite\nnarrow. The enrichment zone lies therefore between rmin = 0.1 pc and rmax = 0.4 pc.\n\n3.\n\nThe unlikely ONC-like setting\n\nThe Orion Nebular Cluster is the epitome of a massive star forming region in the solar\nneighborhood, often invoked as an analog for the birthplace of our Sun (Hester & Desch\n2005; Ouellette et al. 2005; Bally, Moeckel & Throop 2005). The ONC is dominated by\nthe four bright Trapezium O and B stars, which are named \u03b81 and numbered from A to D\n(O'Dell 2001). It is situated \u223c 450 pc away from the Sun and contains roughly half a dozen\nstars massive enough to end their lives as SN (Hillenbrand 1997). In the ONC, the most\nmassive object is the O7 star \u03b81 C Ori, which has a mass of \u223c 40 M\u2299 . Within 1 pc of \u03b81 C\nOri are thousands of low-mass protostars, 70% of which have disks (Hillenbrand et al. 1998).\nSome of the disks are as close as a few tenths of a parsec from \u03b81 C Ori.\nThough evolving on substantially shorter timescales than low-mass stars, high mass\nstars still need a finite time to complete hydrogen and helium burning, and explode in a SN\n(Schaller et al. 1992; Romano et al. 2005). It takes \u223c 40 Myr for a 8 M\u2299 B3 star and \u223c 3\nMyr for an extremely massive 120 M\u2299 O3 star to reach the SN stage respectively. A 40 M\u2299\nstar, such as \u03b81 C Ori, evolves for \u223c 5 Myr before it goes supernova (Figure 1).\nThe age of the ONC is estimated to be 6 1 Myr (e.g. Hillenbrand 1997). The age of\n\u03b8 C Ori is not precisely known, although this star is probably among the youngest members\nof the ONC, because early formation of \u03b81 C Ori would have halted star formation through\nrapid photoionization of the surrounding gas (O'Dell 2001; Boss & Goswami 2007). O'Dell\n(2001) argues that \u03b81 C Ori is the youngest star in the ONC cluster. Palla & Stalher (2001)\ndetermined the age of another Trapezium star, \u03b81 D Ori, and find an upper limit of 0.1 Myr.\nHere it is conservatively assumed that \u03b81 C Ori is 1 Myr old and will go SN 5 Myr after the\nonset of star formation in the ONC, i.e. \u223c 4 Myr from now.\n1\n\nThe protoplanetary disks that are currently within a few tenths of a parsec from \u03b81 C\nOri will suffer severe mass-loss due to photoevaporation driven by the UV radiation from\nthis and other massive stars in the region (Johnstone, Hollenbach & Bally 1998; St\u00f6rzer\n& Hollenbach 1999; Richling & Yoke 2000; Balog et al. 2007). Typical mass loss rates\ndue to photoevaporation are 10\u22127 M\u2299 /yr (Johnstone, Hollenbach & Bally 1998; St\u00f6rzer &\nHollenbach 1999). The typical lifetime of a minimum mass solar nebula of mass 0.01 M\u2299\n(Hayashi et al. 1985) in such an environment is therefore \u223c 105 yr. Johnstone, Hollenbach\n& Bally (1998) studied the specific case of \u03b81 C Ori and showed that, at a distance of 0.3 pc,\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\na protoplanetary disk would shrink to a size of about 1 AU in about 1 Myr, i.e. well before\n\u03b81 C Ori becomes a SN. Disk evaporation simply prevents injection of SN ejecta because disks\nin the vicinity of the SN have essentially disappeared before the SN explosion takes place.\nIt is possible that disks adjacent to \u03b81 C Ori could partially survive photo-evaporation if\ntheir orbits around the massive star are highly elliptical rather than circular (e.g. Adams &\nBloch 2005), or if the photo-evaporation rate decreases rapidly with time (e.g. Adams et al.\n2006). However, in 4 Myr from now, when \u03b81 C Ori goes supernova, such surviving disks will\nbe highly evolved, harboring large planetesimals as well as giant planets (e.g. Montmerle et\nal. 2006). In an Orion-like setting, planetary formation is accelerated by photoevaporation\n(Throop & Bally 2005), reducing accordingly the time window for SR injection. Disks which\nsurvive evaporation will therefore not receive SRs from the SN explosion until very late in\ntheir evolution, inconsistent with cosmochemical evidence for early delivery, which indicates\nthat the injection happened within 1 Myr of disk formation (see section 2).\nOver the next 4 million years, there will be few new low-mass stars forming within 1 pc of\n\u03b8 C Ori. Star formation is certainly more vigorous during the first Myr of a molecular cloud\nlifetime and decreases sharply with time (see Lada & Lada 2003). After a few Myr, the gas in\na molecular cloud has dissipated, and new star formation no longer takes place (Leisawitz,\nBash & Thaddeus 1989; Elmegreen 2000; Hartmann, Ballesteros-Paredes & Bergin 2001;\nLada & Lada 2003). Winds from massive stars and outflows from low-mass stars are primarily\nresponsible for the quick dissipation of the molecular gas (Bally, Moeckel & Throop 2005).\nIn fact, young clusters, such as NGC1333 and Serpens, contain relatively large populations\nof Class 0 sources and are rich in bipolar flows, both features indicative of the earliest stages\nof star formation (e.g. Knee & Sandell 2000; Sandell & Knee 2001). In contrast, older\nclusters, such as IC348, contain few protostellar sources and outflows (Lada & Lada 2003).\nThe fraction of disks in a given cluster, which is homologous to the star formation rate, also\nsteeply decreases with the cluster age (see Figure 1 of Haisch, Lada & Lada 2001).\n1\n\nThe decrease with time of the star forming rate is even more dramatic in the immediate\nvicinity of a massive star (. few pc) than at the global molecular cloud scale. Hillenbrand\n(1997) argues that star formation in the Trapezium, i.e. in the vicinity of \u03b81 C Ori, is now\nover. More generally, star formation cannot occur in the absence of molecular gas, which is\nionized by the enhanced UV flux of massive stars. Wren & O'Dell (1995) estimate that the\nionized HII region created by \u03b81 C Ori is now 0.3 pc wide and is growing at the rate of 0.5\nkm/s. Within the next 4 Myr, this region will expand to a \u223c 2.3 pc wide HII cavity around\n\u03b81 C Ori, where star formation will be effectively halted. Hillenbrand & Hartmann (1998)\nestimate that the \u223c 1 pc wide gaseous region surrounding \u03b81 C Ori will be photoevaporated\non a timescale of 6 1 Myr.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nIt is not only the ionizing power of massive stars, such as \u03b81 C Ori, that contributes to\nthe sharp decrease in star formation rate in their immediate vicinity. The winds emanating\nfrom the massive stars create bubbles. The linear dimension of a wind bubble increases\nwith the mass of the star (Chevalier 1999). A 20 M\u2299 star creates a cavity as large as 11 pc\nin 7 Myr (Chevalier 1999), suggesting that the molecular gas surrounding \u03b81 C Ori will be\ndissipated by winds in addition to photoionization on timescales significantly shorter than\nthe lifetime of \u03b81 C Ori.\nAfter a few Myr of evolution, star formation in ONC-like settings occurs mainly in\nphoto-dissociation regions (PDRs) at the interface of the HII region and the molecular gas\n(Healy, Hester & Claussen 2004), a few parsecs away from the massive star. The fate of\nthe ONC is well illustrated by the 2-3 Myr old NGC2244 cluster, whose most massive star,\nHD206267, has the same spectral type as \u03b81 C Ori. In NGC2244, star formation is occurring\nin the outskirts of the cluster, at distances 5-10 pc from the central O6 star (Hartmann\n2005). In addition, Reach et al. (2004) note that these stars, which formed \u223c 2 Myr before\nHD206267 goes supernova, are the last generation of stars forming in the cluster. Low-mass\nstars formed 3 Myr after the onset of star formation in a given molecular cloud are too far\naway to be contaminated by SRs at any significant level.\nFigure 2 illustrates the discrepancy between the timescales of massive star evolution\nand low-mass star formation for an ONC-like setting.\n\n4.\n\nProbability of SR injection in a young disk by a nearby SN\n\nIn this section, we calculate two numbers: (1) Within a cluster of a given size N\u2217 , what\nis the probability for a young disk (6 1 Myr) attached to a low-mass star to be contaminated\nin SRs by a nearby supernova explosion at the level observed in the early solar system? (2)\nWhat is the probability for any protoplanetary disk in the Galaxy to be contaminated in SRs\nfrom a nearby SN explosion at the level observed in the solar system? The latter number\nwill be calculated by integrating the former with the cluster size distribution (section 4.6).\nThe probability for a disk surrounding a low-mass star in a cluster of a given size (N\u2217 ) to\nbe enriched in SRs by a nearby supernova at the observed solar system abundance without\nbeing disrupted by UV photoevaporation is given by the expression:\nZ Mu\nPSR (N\u2217 ) =\n(3)\nfYSO (tSN ) fenrichment fsurvivors PMSN (N\u2217 )dMSN ,\nMl\n\nwhere fYSO is the fraction of young (6 1 Myr) low mass stars (or Young Stellar Objects)\npresent in the cluster at the time (tSN ) of the supernova explosion, fenrichment is the fraction\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nof low-mass stars present in the enrichment zone, fsurvivors is the fraction of disks which\nhave survived UV photoevaporation and PMSN (N\u2217 ) is the probability that the most massive\nstar in a cluster containing N\u2217 stars has a mass MSN . Ml = 8 M\u2299 and Mu = 150 M\u2299 are,\nrespectively, the masses of the least and most massive star possibly going supernova (Kroupa\n& Weidner 2005). The dependence of fYSOs , fenrichment , fsurvivors and PMSN on N\u2217 and MSN\nwill be described in the following sections.\n\n4.1.\n\nThe most massive star in a cluster\n\nUsing the Initial Mass Function (IMF), dN/dM \u221d M\u2212(1+\u03b1) , where N is the number of\nstars and M the star mass and with \u03b1 = 1.5 (Scalo 1986), Williams & Gaidos (2007) show\nthat the probability that the most massive star in a cluster containing N\u2217 stars has a mass\nMSN is:\n\u0012\n\u00131+\u03b1\n\u03b1fSN N\u2217\nMu\nPMSN (N\u2217 ) =\ne\u2212N (>MSN ) ,\n(4)\n[(Mu /Ml )\u03b1 \u2212 1]Mu MSN\n\nwhere fSN = 0.003 is the total fraction of stars going supernova, i.e. having a mass larger\nthan 8 M\u2299 (Adams & Laughlin 2001). N (> MSN ), the number of stars with mass larger\nthan MSN , is obtained from the IMF and given by the expression:\nN (> MSN ) = fSN N\u2217\n\n(Mu /MSN )\u03b1 \u2212 1\n.\n(Mu /Ml )\u03b1 \u2212 1\n\n(5)\n\nThe dependence of PMSN (N\u2217 ) on N\u2217 is shown in Figure 3 for two fiducial masses, MSN = 40\nM\u2299 and MSN = 120 M\u2299 .\n\n4.2.\n\nFraction of stars in the enrichment zone\n\nYoung stellar clusters are segregated in mass, with the more massive stars present at the\ncenter of the cluster (Hillenbrand & Hartmann 1998 and references therein). This core-halo\nstructure appears to be primordial, based on morphological (Larson 1982) and dynamical\n(Hillenbrand & Hartmann 1998) evidence. It is thus reasonable to consider that clusters\nhave a spherical symmetry, and that the massive star responsible for the putative injection\nof SRs is placed at the center of the cluster (see for example Rho et al. 2006). The number\nof stars in the enrichment zone is therefore given by the expression:\nfenrichment (N\u2217 ) =\n\nZ\n\nrmax\n\nrmin\n\n2\n\n\u03c1(r)4\u03c0r dr/\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nRc (N\u2217 )\n\n\u03c1(r)4\u03c0r 2 dr,\n\n(6)\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nwhere \u03c1(r) is the stellar volume density and rmin and rmax define respectively the minimum\nand maximum acceptable distance between the disk and the SN, defining the enrichment\nzone (see section 2). N\u2217 and Rc (N\u2217 ) are the number of stars contained in the cluster and\nthe cluster radius, respectively.\nObservations of ONC as well as IC348 show that the numbers of stars per unit area,\ni.e. the internal cluster density distribution, decreases approximately as 1/r (Hillenbrand &\nHartmann 1998; Muench et al. 2003), in which case the stellar volume density, \u03c1(r), goes as\n1/r 2 . Inserting the latter expression into equation (6) yields:\nfenrichment (N\u2217 ) =\n\nrmax \u2212 rmin\n.\nRc (N\u2217 )\n\n(7)\n\nUsing the embedded clusters compilation of Ladap& Lada (2003), Adams et al. (2006)\nfind that embedded clusters follow the law Rc \u2248 R300 N\u2217 /300, where Rc is the cluster size\nand R300 is an empirical parameter varying between 1 and 3 pc (Figure 2 of Adams et al.\n2006). This provides an estimate of the average surface density of clusters of different sizes,\nwhich can be formulated as:\n\u03a3 = N\u2217 /\u03c0r2c .\n(8)\nWe consider a wide range for \u03a3 encompassing the range observed by Adams et al. (2006),\ni.e. \u03a3 varies from 10 to 300 stars/pc2 . Note that the ONC is characterized by \u03a3ONC = 211\nstars/pc2 , based on the cluster parameters (Rc = 2.06 pc and N\u2217 = 2817 stars) of Hillenbrand\n& Hartmann (1998). Inserting equation (8) into equation (7) yields:\n\u221a\n(rmax \u2212 rmin ) \u03c0\u03a3\n\u221a\nfenrichment (N\u2217 ) =\n.\n(9)\nN\u2217\n\n4.3.\n\nFraction of disks surviving photoevaporation\n\nDisks residing within a few tenths of a parsec of a massive O star will be UV photoevaporated on timescales significantly shorter than 1 Myr (e.g. St\u00f6rzer & Hollenbach 1999).\nBecause disks can have elliptical orbits around the massive star, and because disk-shrinking\nis limited by the decrease of the mass loss rate with the disk size (Adams et al. 2004), a\nnon-zero fraction of disks might survive nearby massive stars. To estimate the fraction of\ndisks that survive total photoevaporation we will turn again to Orion.\nUsing the Hubble Space Telescope planetary camera, Johnstone, Hollenbach & Bally\n(1998) measured the size of 28 protoplanetary disks in the vicinity of \u03b81 C Ori. Only nine of\nthem have sizes larger than 35 AU, the estimated minimum size of the solar protoplanetary\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\ndisk (e.g. Gomes et al. 2005; Hartmann 2005). This means that, in the case of the \u223c 1\nMyr old ONC, only a disk fraction fsurvivors = 0.32 has resisted to photoevaporation and are\neligible to SN pollution. This number is compatible with the depletion of disks by a factor\nof \u223c 3 observed by Balog et al. (2007) within 0.5 pc of O stars in the 2-3 Myr NGC 2244\nstar forming region.\n\n4.4.\n\nFraction of young low-mass stars at time tSN\n\nAs discussed in section 2, cosmochemical constraints require the SN injection to occur\nearly in the evolution of the protoplanetary disk. We conservatively estimated that injection\nhad to occur in the first 1 Myr of disk evolution. The fraction of low-mass stars younger\nthan \u0398 = 1 Myr at time t is:\n\uf8f1\nR\nR\n\uf8f2 fYSO (t) = 0t \u03c8(t\u2032 )dt\u2032 / 0\u221e \u03c8(t\u2032 )dt\u2032\nfor t 6 \u0398\nRt\nR\u221e\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n(10)\n\uf8f3 fYSO (t) = t\u2212\u0398 \u03c8(t )dt / 0 \u03c8(t )dt for t > \u0398\n\nwhere \u03c8(t) is the star forming rate.\n\nStar forming rates are not very well constrained and are the subject of debate among\nastronomers. We therefore consider three different expressions for \u03c8(t), a combination that\nis likely to bracket reality.\nThe first expression for \u03c8(t) is a step function with a total star formation timescale T\n= 4 Myr:\n(\n\u03c8(t) = \u03c81 for t 6 T\n(11)\n\u03c8(t) = 0\nfor t > T\nExpression (11) gives an overestimated measure of the star formation rate, because star\nforming regions are known to be more active during their first million years than during\nsubsequent times (e.g. Hartmann, Ballesteros-Paredes & Bergin 2001).\nThe second expression for \u03c8(t) is a linearly decreasing function, terminating on a\ntimescale of T = 4 Myr, due to molecular gas dissipation (Leisawitz, Bash & Thaddeus\n1989; Elmegreen 2000; Hartmann, Ballesteros-Paredes & Bergin 2001; Lada & Lada 2003).\n(\n\u03c8(t) = \u03c82 \u00d7 (1 \u2212 Tt ) for t 6 T\n(12)\n\u03c8(t) = 0\nfor t > T\nThe third expression for \u03c8(t) is an exponentially decreasing function with a character-\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nistic star formation timescale of \u03c4 = 0.56 Myr:\nt\n\n\u03c8(t) = \u03c80 \u00d7 e\u2212 \u03c4\n\n(13)\n\nExpression (13) is determined from a fit of star formation rates vs. ages for a suite of observed\nclusters shown in Figure 4. We emphasize that all the star forming regions considered in\nthis plot have similar sizes (i.e. similar contents of gas). This expression describes a rather\nextreme, though possible, star formation history with most stars being formed during the\nfirst million year of evolution.\nOur preferred model corresponds to the linearly decreasing law for \u03c8(t) as it describes\nan intermediary situation between the two extreme cases, the step function and the exponentially decreasing law.\nThe fraction of low-mass stars (calculated with equation (10)) present in the cluster as\na function of time, fYSO (t), is shown in Figure 5 for the three different star formation rates\nconsidered. The sharp cut-offs at \u223c 5 Myr in Figure 5 for the linear and the step function\nstar formation rates are due to finite duration of star formation in an embedded cluster\n(Lada & Lada 2003 and references therein). For these cases, there are no low-mass stars\nyoung enough to be enriched in the cluster at a time t = T + \u0398 = 5 Myr.\nFor disk contamination to occur, the relevant quantity is the fraction of low-mass stars\nat the time tSN of the supernova explosion, i.e. fYSO (tSN ). Evolutionary models for massive\nstars (Schaller et al. 1992; Romano et al. 2005) provide the time tSN at which a massive\nstar goes supernova through the expression:\nlog(tSN ) = 1.4/(logMSN )1.5 ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere tSN and MSN are expressed in Myr and in solar masses respectively.\n\n4.5.\n\nInjection probability in a cluster containing N\u2217 stars: Results\n\nPutting together the expressions defined above, we obtain:\n\u221a\nZ Mu\n(rmax \u2212 rmin ) \u03c0\u03a3\n\u221a\nPSR (N\u2217 ) = fsurvivors\nfYSO (tSN )\nPMSN (N\u2217 )dMSN ,\nN\u2217\nMl\n\n(15)\n\nwhere fYSO (tSN ) and PMSN (N\u2217 ) are given by equations (10), (14) and (4) respectively. With\n\u03a3 = \u03a3ONC = 211 stars/pc2 (section 4.2) and rmin = 0.1 pc and rmax = 0.4 pc (section 2),\nwe obtain a set of curves for PSR (N\u2217 ) shown in Figure 6. Our curves are slightly below that\ncalculated by Williams & Gaidos (2007) because we take explicitly into account the disk\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nphotoevaporation, and because we model the timing of injection in a fashion dictated by the\ncosmochemical constraints, i.e. we consider that injection happened during the first Myr of\ndisk evolution rather than at any time (section 2).\nThe probability for SR enrichment peaks at \u223c 10 000 stars. It is however very low as\nit reaches a maximum value of \u223c 0.4 % for the most favorable case, corresponding to a step\nfunction law for the star formation rate \u03c8(t). It peaks at \u223c 0.03 % for the exponential form\nof the star formation rate, which is based on the data shown in Figure 4. Our preferred model\n(a linearly decreasing function for \u03c8(t)) gives an intermediary result with a maximum value\nof \u223c 0.3 %. Increasing \u03a3 to its maximum value, \u03a3 = 300 stars/pc2 , does not substantially\nchange these results, because PSR (N\u2217 ) varies smoothly with the square root of \u03a3 (see equation\n(15)) and all our calculations are normalized to the high stellar density of the ONC.\n\n4.6.\n\nProbability of injection for any disk\n\nTo calculate the probability of SR injection for any protoplanetary disk attached to a\nlow-mass star in the Galaxy, PGAL , we will integrate PSR (N\u2217 ) over the probability for a star\nto form in a cluster of size N\u2217 , which scales as 1/N\u2217 (Elmegreen & Efremov 1997; Adams &\nLaughlin 2001). In other words,\nPGAL = K\n\nZ\n\nNmax\n\nNmin\n\nPSR (N\u2217 )\n\ndN\u2217\n,\nN\u2217\n\n(16)\n\nwhere Nmin = 100 and Nmax = 5 \u00d7 105 are the minimal and maximal sizes of stellar clusters respectively (McKee & Williams 1997; Williams & Gaidos 2007). The normalization\nconstant, K = 9.39 \u00d7 10\u22122 , is calculated using the observation that \u223c 80 % of stars form in\nclusters larger than 100 members (Lada & Lada 2003). Figure 7 shows PGAL for the three\ndifferent star forming rates discussed in section 4.4. In our preferred case, where \u03a3 = \u03a3ONC\n= 211 stars/pc2 and \u03c8(t) follows a linearly decreasing law, the probability for any disk to\nreceive SRs from a nearby SN at the level observed in the solar system is 1 \u00d7 10\u22123 (grey\ncircle in Figure 7). This probability increases with the square root of \u03a3 as expected from\nequation (15). In the most favorable case, i.e. adopting a step function for the star formation\nrate and with \u03a3 = 300 stars/pc2 , the probability for any diskS to receive SRs from a nearby\nSN at the level observed in the solar system is 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 .\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n4.7.\n\nMultiple supernovae\n\nIf the cluster size is large enough, multiple supernovae can occur within the lifetime of\nthe cluster. Stars with mass below 40 M\u2299 can not contribute to the inventory of SRs because\nthey need too long timescales to evolve (see section 3). Multiple supernovae injection of SRs\ntherefore occur only in clusters large enough to contain at least one star whose mass is larger\nthan 40 M\u2299 . This condition is satisfied only for clusters containing more than N\u2217 = 104\nstars (Equation (5) and Figure 8).\nTo calculate the maximum contribution of nearby massive stars to a young protoplanetary disk, we assume that, for clusters containing more than N\u2217 = 104 stars, every low-mass\nstar will witness a supernova explosion in its youth (6 1 Myr), i.e. that:\nZ Mu\nfYSO (tSN )PMSN (N\u2217 )dMSN = 1.\n(17)\nMl\n\nIntroducing this condition in equation (15) yields a stringent upper limit, as this statement\nis probably true only for the most massive clusters (N\u2217 > 105 ), where there are enough\nstars to include tens of supernovae whose progenitors stars have masses larger than 40 M\u2299 .\nWith this generous permission, we calculate the probability for any young low-mass star\nprotoplanetary disk to be contaminated in SRs by a nearby supernova explosion to be 6 \u00d7\n10\u22123 in the most favorable case (\u03c8(t) described by a step function and \u03a3 = 300 stars/pc2 ).\n\n5.\n5.1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nBeyond Orion: The Carina Nebula\n\nThe probability of a protoplanetary disk to receive SRs from a nearby SN explosion\nwould be higher if one considered a star forming region more massive than the ONC. Such a\nregion would contain more massive stars than the ONC according to the initial mass function\n(Salpeter 1955). For example, a 120 M\u2299 star would be ready to go SN and deliver SRs to\na nearby disk after only \u223c 3 Myr of evolution (Figure 1 and equation (14)). But, 3 Myr\nafter the onset of star formation, the star formation rate has already decreased significantly\nas can be appreciated in Figure 4. Additionally, extremely massive molecular clouds are\nrare, at least in the vicinity of the Sun. Within 2 kpc of the Sun, where the number of\nembedded clusters is large enough to make statistically robust observations, the ONC is the\nmost massive example (Lada & Lada 2003). Finally, a more massive cluster contains more\nmassive stars which are more efficient in dissipating molecular gas by ionization and photodissociation (e.g. Bally, Moeckel & Throop 2005). Despite these difficulties, the massive\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nCarina Nebula star-forming region is now proposed by some authors (e.g. Smith & Brooks\n2007), instead of Orion, as a good analog for the astrophysical environment of our solar\nsystem formation.\nThe Carina Nebula (NGC3372) is a star forming region situated at 2.3 kpc from the\nSun and containing \u223c 65 O stars (Smith 2006). \u03b7 Carinae, the most massive star contained\nin the Carina Nebula (> 100 M\u2299 , Davidson & Humphreys 1997), needs \u223c 3 Myr to go\nsupernova (Smith 2006). Since the age of the cluster is \u223c 3 Myr, assuming it formed at the\nbeginning of the cluster's life, \u03b7 Carinae can go supernova anytime now (Smith 2006). Most\nof the molecular gas in the vicinity of \u03b7 Carinae has however been cleared away, creating an\nextended HII region where star formation is halted (Smith et al. 2000 and Figure 5 of de\nGraauw et al. 1981).\nA few evaporating protoplanetary disks were tentatively detected in the Carina Nebula\nand await confirmation (Smith, Bally & Morse 2003). From the coordinates given by Smith,\nBally & Morse (2003), we calculate that the protoplanetary disk closest to \u03b7 Carinae lies at\na minimum distance of 2.4 pc, a factor of \u223c 10 too large compared to the distance needed to\ninject SRs in sufficient number. In addition, the putative protoplanetary disks detected by\nSmith, Bally & Morse (2003) are significantly more massive (by a factor of \u223c 100) than the\nprotoplanetary disks observed in Orion (Johnstone, Hollenbach & Bally 1998), or than the\nexpected solar protoplanetary disk (0.013 M\u2299 , Hayashi et al. 1985), suggesting that they\nbelong to young intermediate-mass stars rather than to solar-like stars.\nThe scarcity of solar-like protoplanetary disks in the vicinity of \u03b7 Carinae is due to the\nextreme ionizing power of that star which emits Q(H) \u223c 1050.6 ionizing photons per second,\nwhich can be compared to the Q(H) \u223c 1049 photons per second emitted by \u03b81 C Ori (O'Dell\n2001). It confirms that in the immediate vicinity of very massive stars, protoplanetary disks\nare extremely rare because (1) those accompanying low-mass stars which formed contemporaneously with massive stars were photoevaporated or formed planets (Throop & Bally\n2005) and (2) the efficient gas clearing by winds and UV emission has halted new low-mass\nstar formation.\nTriggered star formation in the Carina Nebula occurs in the gas-rich region named\nSouth Pillars (Smith & Brooks 2007). Smith & Brooks (2007) argue that young stars in\nthe South Pillars region will be pelted by supernova ejecta containing SRs. While it is true\nthat these young stars will be exposed to the supernova ejecta, the South Pillars lie 20 pc\naway from \u03b7 Carinae (Smith et al. 2000), almost two orders of magnitude further away\nthan the distance required to incorporate SRs at the abundance observed in the solar system\n(see section 2). Massive stars which form now in the South Pillars will need several Myr\nto explode and deliver SRs to the interstellar medium and therefore suffer from the same\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\ndifficulties discussed above.\n\n5.2.\n\nOn our probability estimate\n\nIn calculating the different probability estimates for the injection of SRs into a young\nprotoplanetary disk attached to a low-mass star, we made several assumptions and simplifications that we discuss in the following.\n\n5.2.1. The enrichment zone\nWe used a minimum distance between the supernova and the disk, rmin = 0.1 pc, proposed by Ouellette, Desch & Hester (2007) from models simulating the interaction of a 25\nM\u2299 SN with a protoplanetary disk. A more massive star, more likely to achieve that goal,\nwould have a more massive ejecta and therefore a more disruptive effect (through momentum transfer) on the disk (Chevalier 2000). The minimum SN-disk distance we adopted is\ntherefore a lower limit, which turns into an upper limit for fenrichment (see equation 3) and\ntherefore into an upper limit for the probability of SR delivery by a nearby SN in a young\ndisk.\nThe distance r varies with the square root of the injection efficiency (\u03b7) and with the\ninverse square root of the initial abundance of short-lived radionuclides (MSS ) (equation\n(2)). The initial abundance of SRs is known within a factor of a few (Gounelle 2006).\nTherefore, changes in their adopted abundance will not change much the results. In the\ncase of injection into a protoplanetary disk, Ouellette, Desch & Hester (2007) show that the\ninjection efficiency is below 1 % for the gas fraction of the ejecta. Though they suggest that\nSRs could be injected in the disk in the form of dust grains, it remains to be demonstrated\nhow plausible dust injection is, especially given that SN dust condensation efficiency (defined\nas the ratio of mass of refractory elements condensed into dust to that of refractory elements\nin the ejecta) is 6 0.12 (Sugerman et al. 2006 and references therein). Ercolano et al. (2007)\nestimate an upper limit as low as 4 \u00d7 10\u22123 for the dust condensation efficiency of supernova\nSN 1987A. If \u03b7 is reduced to one order of magnitude in equation (2), it will reduce the\n\u221a\nmaximum acceptable distance by a factor of 10 \u223c 3, i.e. from 0.4 pc to \u223c 0.15 pc. The\nmaximum distance rmax calculated in section 2 is thereore a strict upper limit, which turns\ninto an upper limit for fenrichment (see equation 3) and, accordingly, for the probability of SR\ndelivery by a nearby SN in a young disk.\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\n5.2.2. Disk UV photoevaporation\nTo estimate the fraction of disks which survived UV photoevaporation(fsurvivors ), we\ncalculated from the data of Johnstone, Bally & Hollenbach (1998) the fraction of disks in\nOrion which are larger than the minimum inferred original size of the solar protoplanetary\ndisk (35 AU, Gomes et al. 2005). This provides a strong upper limit for fsurvivors for three\nreasons. First, the ONC is only \u223c 1 Myr old and at the time of \u03b81 C Ori explosion (4 Myr\nfrom now) many more disks will have their sizes reduced below 35 AU. Second, this estimate\ndoes not include the disks which have already fully evaporated and will not capture any SRs.\nThird, more massive stars, more likely to deliver SRs, have also larger UV fluxes which will\nresult in a more rapid photoevaporation (Johnstone, Bally & Hollenbach 1998). The fraction\nof disks that survive UV photoevaporation, fsurvivors , which we used in our calculations is\ntherefore an upper limit, as is accordingly the probability of SR delivery by a nearby SN in\na young disk.\n\n5.2.3. Temporal coincidence of disks and supernovae in a molecular cloud\nIn calculating fYSO , we considered \u03c8(t), the temporal evolution of the star formation\nrate, at the global molecular cloud scale, and did not take into account the dissipation of\nmolecular gas in the immediate vicinity of the most massive star. This is a simplification\nas discussed in section 3. Because massive stars create very rapidly after their formation a\nHII region in which star formation is impossible, star formation in molecular clouds occurs\nin the outskirts of HII regions, at several parsecs from the massive star (Reach et al. 2004;\nBalog et al. 2007; Hartmann 2005). In other words, after 2-3 Myr of evolution, the star\nformation rate, \u03c8(t), in the immediate vicinity (. 2 pc) of any massive star is virtually zero.\nBy assuming non-zero star formation rates, we definitely calculated a strong upper limit for\nfYSO and therefore for the probability of contamination of a young protoplanetary disk by a\nnearby supernova.\nIn calculating PSR (N\u2217 ) (equation (3)) and fYSO (equations (10) and (14)), we implicitly\nassumed that star formation was coeval in the considered star forming region. In fact, it\nis only if the most massive stars in a cluster formed in advance relative to low-mass stars\nthat the probability of injection can increase. In such a case, the rapid evolution timescale\nof protoplanetary disks could be reconciled with the slower evolution timescale of massive\nstars (Figure 2) and the destructive effect of massive stars would play a less important role.\nIt is commonly argued that molecular clouds have short lives (\u223c 4 Myr) and that star\nformation within them proceed as soon as the cloud is assembled (e.g. Ballesteros-Paredes\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\net al. 2007). This implies that the star formation age spread is small (though non zero, e.g.\nHartmann 2001). On the other hand Palla & Stalher (2000) have argued that molecular\nclouds live some tens of Myr and that some stars form in advance compared to the majority\nof stars. Even if this is correct, it would not solve the timescale problem, because all stars\nwhich possibly formed early relative to the majority of stars in the cluster have (at least in\nthe case of the ONC) masses below 0.3 M\u2299 (Palla et al. 2007). Such stars are far from being\nmassive enough to go SN and deliver SRs to a nearby protoplanetary disk. We note that,\nin general, high-mass stars are likely to form last in a cluster (Bally et al. 1998; St\u00f6rzer &\nHollenbach 1999; O'Dell 2001; Kroupa & Weidner 2005; Henriksen 1986; Boss & Goswami\n2007). This implies again that the probability estimates given in the previous sections are\nupper limits.\n\n5.2.4. Multiple supernovae\nThe contamination probability in the case of multiple supernovae was explicitly overestimated in assuming (equation (17)) that every low-mass star in the cluster will witness a\nsupernova explosion in its youth (T 6 1 Myr). The overall contamination probability was\nalso implicitly overestimated by keeping fenrichment identical to that calculated in the single\nsupernova case. This is because, in calculating fenrichment (section 4.2), we assumed that the\nmost massive star is located at the center of the cluster, where the density of stars is highest.\nIn the case of multiple supernovae, the additional massive stars are located in the cluster\nperiphery (as only the most massive star occupies the cluster center) where low-mass stars\nare rare, decreasing accordingly fenrichment .\nEven with those gross approximations, the effect of multiple supernovae is to increase\nthe probability by a factor of only a few. This factor of a few would cancel if the physical\neffect of many more massive stars were properly taken into account. More massive stars\nwould lead to increased photoevaporation power, clearing very large HII regions where star\nformation is halted. For example the HII region surrounding \u03b7 Carinae has an expansion\nradius of 110 pc (Smith et al. 2000). In addition, the presence of many more massive\nstars would also increase the probability of close stellar encounters, and therefore planetary\ndisruption (see below). For all these reasons, we will ignore the increase by a factor of a few\nin the calculated probability due to multiple supernovae.\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\n5.2.5. Planetary disruption\nA low-mass star born in a large cluster where many massive stars are present can endure\nclose stellar encounters, which have the possibility to disrupt the orbits of planets and small\nbodies. This was modeled by Adams & Laughlin (2001). They showed that for clusters\nlarger than \u223c 2500 members, the cluster density is such that stellar encounters would modify\nthe orbits of the giant planets and the Kuiper Belt. This led Adams & Laughlin (2001) to\nsuggest that the Sun formed in a cluster smaller than a few thousand stars. In doing so, they\nconsidered relatively long relaxation timescales for clusters. This was criticized by Hester\n& Desch (2005). Though small clusters live only up to 10 Myr before disruption, there is a\nnon zero fraction of clusters, corresponding to the most massive ones, which live hundreds\nof Myr (Lada & Lada 2003), similarly to the lifetimes of the Pleiades. Kroupa et al. (2001)\nsuggested on the basis of a dynamical study that the ONC might become an open cluster\nsimilar to the Pleiades, reinforcing the idea that for large clusters the relaxation timescales\nadopted by Adams & Laughlin (2001) is correct. Because other complications might arise\n(e.g. Megeath et al. 2007) we did not, however, take explicitly into account the effect of\nclose stellar encounters in our calculations. Neglecting these effects for large clusters implies\nthat the probability of SR delivery by a nearby SN to a young disk, which we calculated\nabove, is an upper limit.\n\n6.\n\nImplications for the origin of short-lived radionuclides\n6.1.\n\nThe origin of short-lived radionuclides\n\nThe probability for any protoplanetary disk attached to a young low-mass star to receive\nSRs from a nearby SN at the level observed in the solar system is \u223c 1 \u00d7 10\u22123 in our preferred\ncase. As shown in section 5.2, this value is a stringent upper limit. Although improbable\ndoes not mean impossible, this very low probability suggests that other sources should be\nconsidered for explaining the overabundance (compared to the interstellar medium average\nvalue) of SRs in the early solar system (Wadhwa et al. 2007). Some of the SRs, such as\n26\nAl, 36 Cl, 41 Ca and 53 Mn can be made by in situ irradiation together with 7 Be and 10 Be\n(e.g. Gounelle et al. 2006), and therefore do not necessitate further elucidation. Iron-60,\non the other hand cannot be made by local irradiation (Lee et al. 1998). It is therefore\nnecessary to find a source of 60 Fe, within a plausible astrophysical context. Besides the\nnearby supernova scenario, which seems to be unlikely, there are two remaining possibilities\nfor the 60 Fe presence in the solar system: (1) a distant SN or (2) an inherited origin resulting\nfrom the contributions of many SN.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nA distant supernova (i.e. at a few parsecs from the solar system) was invoked in the\npast as the source of 60 Fe and other short-lived radionuclides (Cameron & Truran 1977;\nCameron et al. 1995). In that context, it was also assumed that the supernova shockwave\ntriggered the collapse of the dense core. This proposition has a number of problems. First,\nvery special conditions are needed to inject short-lived radionuclides in a dense molecular\ncloud core without disrupting it (e.g. Boss & Vanhala 2000 and references therein). The\nsupernova shockwave needs to impact the core with a fine-tuned velocity of \u223c 20 km/s.\nA higher shockwave velocity would disrupt the dense core, while a slower one would fail\nto induce collapse and inject radioactivities. Second, injection calculations do not take into\naccount the filamentary nature of molecular clouds, which consist of the fractal juxtaposition\nof high density clumps and low density interclumps matter (e.g. Rho et al. 2006), but treat\nthe cloud as an homogeneous and dense matter. A supernova shockwave within a molecular\ncloud will follow the path of less resistance, and will probably avoid the denser regions and\ninstead expand into the interclump matter (Chevalier 1999) delivering very few, if any at\nall, short-lived radionuclides to molecular cloud cores. Third, though the larger size of a\nmolecular cloud core compared to a protoplanetary disk allows it to collect SRs from a SN\nejecta at larger distances (see equation 2), it cannot be much further away than a few pc\n(Looney, Tobin & Fields 2006), and many of the difficulties described above hold in that\ncase too.\n\n6.2.\n\nThe solar system initial content of\n\n60\n\nFe\n\nFor some years, a high inferred initial 60 Fe/56 Fe ratio (e.g. Mostefaoui et al. 2005) was\nconsidered as a smoking gun for ruling out an inherited origin for 60 Fe (Hester & Desch\n2005). The experimental situation has now changed as was recently discussed at the Hawaii\nmeeting on the chronology of meteorites1 . The maximum solar system 60 Fe/56 Fe initial ratio\nof 1 \u00d7 10\u22126 (e.g. Wadwha et al. 2007) is probably too high an estimate. Below we give a\nsummary of the various estimates for the initial 60 Fe/56 Fe ratio in the solar system.\nMeasurements of Ni isotopes in CAIs are challenging because CAIs are rich in Ni nucleosynthetic anomalies, which can blur the effect of 60 Fe decay (Birck 2004). An upper limit\non the 60 Fe/56 Fe ratio of 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22126 was given by Birck & Lugmair (1988) for an Allende\nCAI with a Fe/Ni ratio of \u223c 20. We note that no isochron was reported for this object,\nand that the authors expressed caution about the 60 Fe decay origin of the small (\u223c 0.01 %)\nanomaly detected. A two point internal isochron for an Allende CAI measured by Quitt\u00e9 et\n1\n\nhttp://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/metchron2007\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nal. (2007) gave a lower limit for the initial\n\n60\n\nFe/56 Fe ratio of 3 \u00d7 10\u22127 .\n\nMeasurements on the silicate portion of chondrules from primitive meteorites, including\nSemarkona, yield 60 Fe/56 Fe ratios between 1.7 and 3.2 \u00d7 10\u22127 (Tachibana et al. 2006;\nTachibana et al. 2007), while a measurement from a Semarkona troilite (FeS) gives 60 Fe/56 Fe\n\u223c 9 \u00d7 10\u22127 (Mostefaoui et al. 2005). High 60 Fe/56 Fe initial ratios in troilite can be due to\nFe-Ni redistribution in the sulfides during later alteration processes (Guan et al. 2007). It is\nindeed difficult to understand how troilite would have formed with a higher initial 60 Fe/56 Fe\nratio than silicates in chondrules from the same meteorite. If an hypothetic time delay of\n1.6 Myr is assumed between the formation of the solar system and the closure of the Fe-Ni\nsystem in ordinary chondrites (Connelly et al. 2007), initial 60 Fe/56 Fe ratios between 3.6\nand 6.7 \u00d7 10\u22127 can be calculated from the measurements of Tachibana et al. (2006) and\nTachibana et al. (2007).\nDifferentiated meteorites add to the complexity of the Fe-Ni system. The absence of\nFe evidence in minerals from eucrites and angrites with high Fe/Ni ratios lead Sugiura et\nal. (2006) to put an upper limit of 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22127 on the initial 60 Fe/56 Fe ratio. Quitt\u00e9 et al.\n(2006) reported values of (1.3 \u00b1 0.8) \u00d7 10\u22129 and (8.2 \u00b1 2.6) \u00d7 10\u22129 for the 60 Fe/56 Fe at\nthe time of formation of the angrites Sahara-99555 and d'Orbigny. Combined with Pb-Pb\nages of \u223c 3.3 and \u223c 2.6 Myr after CAIs respectively (Amelin et al. 2006; Amelin 2007),\nthese estimates lead to an upper value for the initial 60 Fe/56 Fe of 1 \u00d7 10\u22127 . The study of\nthe eucrites Chervony Kut and Juvinas lead Shukolyukov & Lugmair (1993) to put an upper\nlimit of 2 \u00d7 10\u22127 for the initial 60 Fe/56 Fe ratio.\n60\n\nAlthough there is at present no consensus on the initial value of 60 Fe in the early solar\nsystem, a low value for the 60 Fe/56 Fe ratio of a few times 10\u22127 seems preferred.\n\n6.3.\n\nAn inherited origin for\n\n60\n\nFe\n\nWhile a high (1 \u00d7 10\u22126) initial 60 Fe/56 Fe ratio could be interpreted as a strong evidence\nfor a nearby SN contamination, revision to a lower initial value (60 Fe/56 Fe \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u22127 )\nchanges the outcome because it is compatible with a galactic background origin for 60 Fe.\nThe present average galactic value of the 26 Al/27 Al ratio has been estimated to be 8.4\n\u00d7 10\u22126 (Diehl et al. 2006). Recent measurements of \u03b3-ray lines in the interstellar medium\nwith the Integral satellite have yielded a ratio 60 Fe/26 Al = 0.148 (Wang et al. 2007). Using\nan elemental ratio 27 Al/56 Fe = 0.109 (Lodders 2003) gives an average galactic value for the\n60\nFe/56 Fe ratio of 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22127. This latter value is identical to the lower estimates of the early\nsolar system inferred from meteorites (see above). Even if the initial solar system 60 Fe/56 Fe\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nratio was as high as 4 \u00d7 10\u22127 (e.g. Quitt\u00e9 et al. 2007), fluctuations around the average value\ncould easily explain the presence of 60 Fe due to an inherited origin in the solar system.\nIt is important to note that this estimate is that of the present interstellar medium. It\nmight have been significantly different 4.6 Gyr ago. In addition, this number is averaged on\nthe entire inner Galaxy. Heterogeneities in the 26 Al abundance in the Galaxy (Kn\u00f6dlseder\net al. 1999) suggest that both 26 Al and 60 Fe abundances can fluctuate around the average\nvalue calculated above. Such calculations show that if the initial solar system 60 Fe/56 Fe ratio\nwas only a few times 10\u22127 , the need for a single supernova vanishes and an inherited origin\ncan account for the 60 Fe found in the early solar system. Though 26 Al decays faster than\n60\nFe, an inherited origin cannot be excluded for this radionuclide either2 .\nWe are especially grateful to Fred Adams and Thierry Montmerle for their generous and\nstimulating inputs throughout the writing of that paper.

Schaller et al. (1992) fitted their models\nwith the expression log(tSN ) = 1.4/(logMSN )1.5 where tSN and MSN are respectively the\nevolutionary timescale (in Myr) and the mass of the considered star (in M\u2299 ). More recent\nwork by Romano et al. (2005) confirm the findings of Schaller et al. (1992).\n\n\f\u2013 30 \u2013\n\nFig. 2.- Sketch illustrating the fundamental problems met by the idea of short-lived radionuclides injection in a protoplanetary disk by a nearby supernova. In this cartoon, the\nevolution of a massive star (large circle) and several low-mass stars within molecular gas\n(light grey) are shown. In panel (a) is depicted the onset of star formation assumed to be\ncoeval for all stars. During that stage, only dense cores are present. Note that if there is\nany spread in the onset of star formation, it would correspond to a delayed formation of the\nmassive star (see text). One million year later (panel (b)), the massive star has carved a\n\u223c 0.3 pc wide HII cavity. Disks which are within this cavity are evaporating as depicted\nby their cometary appearance similar to that observed in Orion protoplanetary disks. Star\nformation is less vigorous than at T = 0 Myr. At T = 2 Myr (panel (c)), the HII cavity has\nexpanded to \u223c 1 pc (see text). The disks which are inside the cavity are totally photoevaporated (Johnstone, Hollenbach & Bally 1998). Low-mass stars that formed at T = 0 Myr now\nhave planets. Very few new stars are forming (see text and Figure 4). When the massive\nstar goes supernova (panel (d)), the stars in the uttermost vicinity of the supernova do not\nhave disks, while disks further away have already dissipated to form planets. At this stage,\nstar formation is virtually non-existent because molecular gas has largely been cleaned by\nthe massive star wind and UV emission. A left-over, evanescent, parcel of molecular gas is\nshown in light grey. Injection of SRs by the supernova in a late-formed disk (marked with\nan arrow) is an extremely improbable event. An indicative scale would be given by the size\n(few tenths of parsec) of the HII cavity in panel (b).\n\n\f\u2013 31 \u2013\n\n1.8\n1.6\n\nMSN = 120 Msun\nM = 40 M\nSN\n\nsun\n\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n\nP\n\nM\n\nSN\n\n*\n\n(N ) (%)\n\n1.4\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0 2\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\n5\n\n10\n\n10\n\nCluster size (N )\n*\n\nFig. 3.- Probability that the most massive star in a cluster containing N\u2217 stars has a mass\nMSN = 40 M\u2299 and MSN = 120 M\u2299 (equation (4)). Note that the maximum probability for\na 40 M\u2299 star to be the most massive star occurs for a cluster of \u223c 4000 stars, slightly larger\nthan the ONC.\n\n\f\u2013 32 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- Star-formation rate versus age for a suite of well studied molecular clouds. Cham\nand \u03c1 Oph stand for Chamaeleon I and \u03c1 Ophiuchi respectively. The thick dashed line\nis the fit of the data which minimizes the exponential decrease of the star formation rate\n(see section 4.4). It gives a decay time constant of \u03c4 = 0.56 Myr. The age of a given\nstar-forming region depends on the mass of the stars and their position on the HertzsprungRussell diagram, among other parameters (Palla & Stahler 2000; Hartmann 2001). For \u03c1\nOphiuchi, we take the commonly accepted age of \u223c 1 Myr (Preibich & Zinnecker 1999; Palla\n& Stahler 2000). For other molecular clouds, we adopt the age compilation as well as their\nassociated error bars given by Haisch, Lada & Lada (2001). These ages are compatible with\nother, more recent, estimates in the literature (e.g. Luhman 2004; Muench et al. 2007). The\nerrors take into account the error in the mean of the source age derived from a given set\nof Pre Main Sequence (PMS) tracks (Haisch, Lada & Lada 2001). Errors due to the use of\ndifferent PMS models are of the order of 1 Myr and could result in a shift of the data without\nchanging the relative age sequence (Haisch, Lada & Lada 2001). Star formation rates for\nindividual molecular clouds are given by Preibisch & Zinnecker (1999) without associated\nerror bars. Note that star formation rates are not available for older clusters because there\nare no observed star-forming molecular clouds older than a few Myr (Elmegreen 2000; Lada\n& Lada 2003; Hartmann, Ballesteros-Paredes & Bergin 2001).\n\n\f\u2013 33 \u2013\n\n\u03c8(t) Exponential\n\u03c8(t) Step\n\u03c8(t) Linear\n\n0\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\nfYSO\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nt (Myr)\nFig. 5.- Fraction of low-mass stars younger than 1 Myr (fYSO ) present in the cluster as a\nfunction of time t (equation 10). fYSO is shown for the 3 expressions considered for the star\nforming rate, \u03c8(t), and discussed in the text.\n\n\f\u2013 34 \u2013\n\n\u03a3 =211 stars.pc\u22122\n3\n\n\u03c8(t) step\n\u03c8(t) linear\n\u03c8(t) exponential\nWilliams & Gaidos (2007)\n\n2.5\n\nPSR (%)\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0 2\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\n5\n\n10\n\n10\n\nCluster size (N )\n*\n\nFig. 6.- Probability of protoplanetary disk enrichment in SRs at the level observed in the\nsolar system (PSR (N\u2217 )) as a function of the cluster size (N\u2217 ), and calculated for the different\nexpressions of the star forming rate \u03c8(t).
