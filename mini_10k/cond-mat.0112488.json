In the limiting case that the\nspin relaxation rates are much faster than the exciton\nformation rates from e-h polaron pairs we showed that\n\u03b7max = (1 + 3r\u22121 )\u22121 [5]. Thus the study of the ratio\nr in organic materials also provides information about\n\u03b7max in OLEDs. Using this spectroscopic technique we\ncould infer r [5], and consequently \u03b7max in a variety\nof \u03c0-conjugated materials without the need to fabricate\nOLEDs based on the particular material as the active\nlayer. We found that r depends on the material optical gap in a systematic but non-monotonic way, and the\nreason for this was investigated [5].\nIn the present work we measured the dependence of r,\nand consequently \u03b7max on the CL in a large variety of\n\u03c0-conjugated oligomer and polymer films using the spectroscopic method developed previously [5]. We indeed\nfound that r increases with the CL; (here we denote with\nthe number n a CL corresponding to the length of an\noligothiophene with n \"rings\"), where r \u2248 1 in small\nmolecules, which are considered to have CL of n \u2248 1.\nMoreover we discovered a universal dependence of r on\nn, namely an approximately linear dependence of r\u22121 on\nn\u22121 , irrespective of the chain backbone structure or side\ngroups. This discovery clarifies the previous results [2\u20137]\nand indicates that polymers with long CL are superior\nmaterials for application as active layers in \u03c0-conjugated\nOLEDs. This finding may also guide theoretical studies aiming to understand the underlying physics behind\nthe spin-dependent exciton formation and its relation to\nelectron correlation in \u03c0-conjugated materials.\nTo determine the ratio of the spin-dependent exciton\nformation cross-sections we have employed the PA and\nPADMR spectroscopies. The PA technique has been\nwidely used in \u03c0-conjugated materials for studying longlived photoexcitations having associated PA bands at\nsubgap energies [8\u201311]. Two light beams are used in PA;\none beam to excite the sample film over the optical gap\nand the other to probe the modulated changes, \u2206T in the\noptical transmission, T. For excitation we used an Ar+\nlaser beam that was modulated with a chopper. A combination of various incandescent lamps (xenon, tungstenhalogen and a glowbar), diffraction gratings, optical filters, and solid state detectors (silicon, germanium and\nindium-antimonide) was used to span the probe photon\n\nWe have measured the ratio, r = \u03c3S /\u03c3T of the formation cross section, \u03c3 of singlet (\u03c3S ) and triplet (\u03c3T ) excitons from oppositely charged polarons in a large variety of\n\u03c0-conjugated oligomer and polymer films, using the photoinduced absorption and optically detected magnetic resonance\nspectroscopies. The ratio r is directly related to the singlet\nexciton yield, which in turn determines the maximum electroluminescence quantum efficiency in organic light emitting\ndiodes (OLED). We discovered that r increases with the conjugation length, CL; in fact a universal dependence exists in\nwhich r \u22121 depends linearly on CL\u22121 , irrespective of the chain\nbackbone structure. These results indicate that \u03c0-conjugated\npolymers have a clear advantage over small molecules in\nOLED applications.\n\nThe efficiency of fluorescence-based organic light emitting diodes (OLED) is determined by the fraction of\ninjected electrons (e) and holes (h) that recombine to\nform emissive spin-singlet excitons, rather than the nonemissive spin-triplet excitons. If the process by which\nthese excitons form were spin-independent, then the\nmaximum quantum efficiency, \u03b7max of OLEDs would be\nlimited to 25% [1], which is the statistical limit. The reason for the 25% statistical limit is that the combination\nof two spin-1/2 particles gives four possible total spin\nstates; three of which have total spin 1, only one is a singlet state. But recent reports have indicated that \u03b7max in\n\u03c0-conjugated OLEDs ranges between 22% to 63% [2\u20136],\nand the reason for this variation is under investigation.\nIn particular the dependence of \u03b7max on the conjugation\nlength (CL) was recently tested by measuring \u03b7max in a\nmonomer and related polymer, and the possibility that\n\u03b7max increases with the CL in \u03c0-conjugated materials\nwas advanced [6].\nFor systems which are light emitting the quantum efficiency, \u03b7EL for electro-luminescence (EL), is \u03b7EL =\n\u03b71 \u03b72 \u03b73 , where \u03b71 is the singlet emission quantum efficiency, \u03b72 is the fraction of the total number of excitons\nthat are singlets, and \u03b73 is the probability that the injected e and h find each other to form e-h pairs [7]. Since\nboth \u03b71 and \u03b73 < 1, it follows that \u03b7EL < \u03b72 = \u03b7max .\nWe have recently developed [5] a spectroscopic technique\nbased on photoinduced absorption (PA) and PA-detected\nmagnetic resonance (PADMR) spectroscopies, which allows direct measurement of the ratio r = \u03c3S /\u03c3T of the\nformation cross-section, \u03c3 of singlet (\u03c3S ) and triplet (\u03c3T )\n\n1\n\n\fenergy, h\u0304\u03c9 between 0.3 and 3 eV. The PA spectrum,\n(\u2206\u03b1(\u03c9)) was obtained by dividing \u2206T /T , where \u2206T was\nmeasured by a phase sensitive technique referenced to the\nexcitation modulation, and \u2206\u03b1 = \u2212d\u22121 \u2206T /T where d is\nthe film thickness.\nThe effect of spin-dependent recombination on the PA\nbands in the photomodulation spectrum was studied by\nthe PADMR technique [12,13]. In this technique we measure the changes, \u03b4T that are induced in \u2206T by \u03bc-wave\nabsorption in magnetic field, H in resonance with the Zeeman split spin-1/2 sublevels of photoinduced polarons in\nthe film. \u03b4T is proportional to \u03b4N that is induced in the\npolaron density, N due to changes in the polaron pair\nrecombination rates. Two types of PADMR spectra are\npossible: the H-PADMR spectrum in which \u03b4T is measured at a fixed probe wavelength, \u03bb as the magnetic\nfield H is scanned, and the \u03bb-PADMR spectrum in which\n\u03b4T is measured at a constant H in resonance, while \u03bb is\nscanned. We note that the PADMR setup allows both\nPA and PADMR spectra to be measured under identical conditions, so that the fractional change \u03b4T /\u2206T is\nobtained with high precision and confidence.\nFor illustration of our method we choose a soluble oligothiophene, namely a dodecathiophene derivative (12T,\nor n = 12, for the molecular structure see Fig. 1(a),\ninset). In Fig. 1(a) we show the PA spectrum of an\namorphous 12T film measured at 80K. The PA bands labeled P1 and P2 in the spectrum are spectral signatures\nof photogenerated long-lived polarons, both P + and P \u2212 .\nThe PA band marked T1 is due to triplet exciton optical transitions [14]. In pristine 12T film the band T1\ndominates the PA spectrum, whereas the polaron bands\nappear only as small shoulders. For the present measurements, where the polaron dynamics is essential we\nthus substantially enhanced the polaron bands in the PA\nspectrum by a photooxidation process, which is known\nto increase charge photogeneration in oligomer films [15].\nThis was done by exposing the 12T film at ambient temperature to a UV-filtered beam from a 450-Watt xenon\nlamp for a three-hour period.\nIn PA under steady state excitation conditions chargetransfer (CT) reactions occur between neighboring photogenerated P + and P \u2212 . The CT reaction rate RP between spin parallel pairs (for the two spin up and down\ndirections) is proportional to 2\u03c3T , whereas the CT reaction rate RAP between spin antiparallel pairs (both\nspin up-down and down-up) is proportional to (\u03c3S + \u03c3T ),\nwhere the proportionality constant is the same in both\ncases [5]. Since \u03c3S > \u03c3T in \u03c0- conjugated compounds,\nthen RAP > RP , and spin polarization of the recombining polaron pairs is built up over time, such that spin\nparallel pairs prevail at steady state conditions. Under saturated magnetic resonance conditions the Zeeman\nsplit sublevels become equally populated, so that the polaron pair densities with parallel and antiparallel spins\nare equal. Thus the PADMR measurements detect a re-\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n7.0\n6.0\n\nS\n\n5.0\n\n4\n\n10 (-\u2206T/T)\n\nS\nS\n\nS\n\nS\nS\n\nS\nS\n\nC12H25\n\n4.0\n\nS\n\nS\nS\n\nS\n\nC12H25\n\nP1\n\n3.0\n\n2.0\n\nC12H25\n\nC12H25\n\n(a) PA\n\n1.8\n\nT1\nP2\n\n2.0\n1.0\n0.0\n0.5\n\n(b) PADMR\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\u03b4T/\u2206 T (%)\n\n5\n\n10 (-\u03b4T/T)\n\n0.0\n\n-1.0\n-1.5\n\nP1\n\n-2.0\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n-2\n\nP2\n\nT1\n\n-4\n-6\n1.00 1.05 1.10\nH (kG)\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2.0\n\nphoton energy (eV)\nFIG. 1.

The PA was measured at 80 K, the excitation was at the 488 nm line (500 mW) of an Ar + laser; the\nPADMR spectrum was measured at 10 K.\n\nduction \u03b4N (which is proportional to \u03b4T ) in the polaron\ndensity N (which is proportional to \u2206T ), since slowly recombining parallel pairs are converted to more efficiently\nrecombining antiparallel pairs. At the same time the density of triplet excitons also decreases as a result of the\ndecrease in the density of parallel polaron pairs. The\nquantity \u03b4T /\u2206T is thus a direct measure of the fractional change in the overall polaron pair density, \u03b4N/N .\nFor distant pair kinetics under saturation conditions we\nhave [11] \u03b4N/N = \u2212(RP \u2212 RAP )2 /(RP + RAP )2 , which\nwhen using the proportionality relations above between\nRP , RAP and \u03c3S and \u03c3T translates to [5]:\nr = \u03c3S /\u03c3T =\n\n1 + 3(\u03b4T /\u2206T )1/2\n1 \u2212 (\u03b4T /\u2206T )1/2\n\n(1)\n\nThus the combination of PA and spin-1/2 PADMR spectroscopies gives a direct measure of r.\nThe spin 1/2 PADMR spectrum of 12T (Fig. 1(b))\nclearly shows the negative magnetic resonance response\nat the PA bands P1 and P2 , which are due to a reduction in the photogenerated polaron density. In addition\n2\n\n\fFor this purpose we first demonstrate a direct and universal spectroscopic method that we found to obtain the\nCL of \u03c0-conjugated compounds. Obviously oligomers\nhave a well-defined CL that is equal to the number of\nthe repeat units in the chain; however polymers may\nhave a very long chain-length. Nevertheless it is well\nestablished that the chemical conjugation and thus the\nelectronic extent of the \u03c0-electron wave functions are\nonly defect-free on a length-scale of the much smaller\nCL [19]. We may therefore deduce the polymer CL by\ninspecting the optical transitions of intrachain electronic\nexcitations that are constrained by the CL, in much the\nsame way as energy levels of a \"particle in a box\". Fig.\n3 shows the dependence of the lower absorption band\nP1 of polarons vs. 1/n for a variety of singly oxidized\noligomers; the experimental values were taken from the\nliterature [20]. We emphasize that Fig. 3 contains data\nfor many oligomers of different length as well as for three\ndifferent \u03c0-conjugated systems, namely oligothiophenes,\noligophenyls and oligophenylene-vinylenes. It is seen that\nthe band P1 depends linearly on 1/n irrespective of the\n\u03c0-conjugated backbone system. In fact the dependence\nof P1 on 1/n is universal and therefore can be used to infer the average CL of many \u03c0-conjugated polymer films.\nWe may therefore deduce the polymer CL in our studies from the P1 peak energy in the PA spectrum. This\ncan be readily done since the magnitude and photon energy of the P1 band was carefully measured in our PA\nmeasurements.\n\nwe also see a negative response at the triplet band T1 ,\nwhich confirms our assumption that r > 1. The resonant reduction of triplets should be compensated by an\nincrease in the singlet exciton population and thus an\nincrease in the photoluminescence under magnetic resonance condition was measured [16]. Also we tentatively\nassign the positive PA band in the \u03bb-PADMR spectrum\naround 1 eV to a singlet exciton absorption band caused\nby excess singlet excitons that result from the excess spin\nanti-parallel polaron pairs created upon the \u03bc-wave absorption. However more work, especially in the ps time\ndomain has to be completed to confirm this assignment.\n\u03b4T /\u2206T was determined for 12T to be 5.5% at resonance (Fig. 1 (b) inset); using Eq. (1) this translates\nto r = 2.2. Similar measurements were also completed\nfor three other oligothiophenes, where r was also determined. The results are summarized in Fig. 2, where\nr for all four oligothiophenes and regio-regular poly(3hexylthiophene) [RR-P3HT] is plotted vs. 1/n, where n\nis the number of the five-member rings in the oligomer;\nwe assumed 1/n = 0 for RR-P3HT due to the lamellar morphology of this film [17,18]. From Fig. 2 it\nis seen that r decreases for short oligomers, which by\nextrapolation reaches r \u2248 1 for the monomers. However we show below that our results are more general,\nwhere r appears to decrease with the CL in \u03c0-conjugated\ncompounds largely independent of the polymer backbone\nstructure.\n4.5\n\n2.0\n4.0\n\nRR-P3HT\n\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\n\n3.0\n\n2.5\n\n17T\n12T\n\n1.2\n\nP1 (eV)\n\nr=\u03c3S/\u03c3T\n\n3.5\n\n9T\n2.0\n\n6T\n\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n\nP1 in oligothiophenes\nP1 in oligophenyls\nP1 in oligoPV\n\n1.5\n\n0.4\n1.0\n0.00\n\n0.2\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n0.15\n\n0.20\n\n0.25\n\n0.0\n\n1/n\n\n0.0\n\nFIG. 2.

The data\nfor the different oligomer classes were taken from [20].The line\nthrough the data points is a linear fit.\n\n3\n\n\fclear r(n) dependence. Firstly we note that the wavefunction extent of singlet excitons was measured to be\nas large as the chain CL [19]. On the contrary the\nwave-function extent of triplet excitons is always very\nconfined: Indeed an average separation of electron and\nhole in the triplet state of PPV was measured to be\n\u2248 3.2\u00c5 [24]. Therefore the difference between the singlet and triplet excitons significantly decreases with 1/n\n[25], and this may explain the reason that r decreases\nwith 1/n. Alternatively the variation of r with n may\nbe due to the variation of the Langevin capture mechanism of charge recombination with CL [6]. When the\nLangevin capture radius, RL >> na, where a is the\nmonomer length, then the recombining polarons reside\non separate molecules and therefore their wave-function\noverlap is small. This, in turn reduces the exchange energy that figures in the triplet energy, thus reducing the\ndifference between polaron pair recombination with parallel or antiparallel spins. However the apparent linear\ndependence of r\u22121 on 1/n remains a mystery.\nIn summary we have measured the formation crosssection ratio, r of singlet and triplet excitons that are\ngenerated in \u03c0-conjugated materials from polaron pairs,\nusing the PA and PADMR spectroscopies. We deduced r\nfrom the change in the spin dependent recombination of\npolaron pairs in a wide variety of \u03c0-conjugated oligomer\nand polymer films. In oligothiophenes we found that r\nincreases with the chain length. Based on a universal\nrelationship between the low-energy polaron absorption\nand the chain length in oligomers, we discover that r\u22121 is\nlinearly proportional to the inverse CL in both polymers\nand oligomers. This may be due to the suppression of the\ndistinctively contrasting properties of triplet and singlet\nexcitons at small CL.\nWe thank Dr. Mazumdar for useful discussion and\nencouragement to complete this work. We also thank\nDrs. Scherf for kindly supplying the mLPPP polymer,\nBradley for the PFO polymer and Barton for supplying the Si-bridged PT and PPE polymers; we also thank\nDrs. DeLong and Chinn for preparing the DOO-PPV\nand PPV polymers. The work at the University of Utah\nwas partially supported by DOE ER-45490.\n\nIn order to show the universality of the function r(n)\nin \u03c0-conjugated materials we replotted in Fig. 4 our results of r vs. the optical gap [5], in the form of r\u22121 vs.\nP1 ; for completeness we have also included in this plot\nour present results in oligothiophenes. Since P1 is a linear\nfunction of 1/n we may actually plot r\u22121 vs 1/n as is also\nshown in Fig. 4 (upper axis). Amazingly we discover a\nuniversal behavior of r(n), namely that r\u22121 depends linearly on 1/n irrespective of the chain backbone structure.\nWe note that, as is apparent from Fig. 4, we encounter\nnegative values for 1/n for several polymers that have the\nlowest P1 transitions (see [21] for a discussion).\n1/n\n0.00\n\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n0.15\n\ns-6T\n\nPPE\n\n9T\n\n12T\n\nRRa-P3HT\nPPV\n\nmLPPP\n\nPFO\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\nRR-P3HT\n\nr\n\n-1\n\n0.4\n\nSi-PT\n\n0.5\n\n17T\n\nMeH-PPV\n\n0.6\n\n0.3\n\n0.20\n\n6T\n\n-0.05\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nP1 (eV)\nFIG. 4. The ratio r =\u03c3T /\u03c3S of spin-dependent exciton\nformation cross sections in various polymers and oligomers\nas a function of the peak photon energy of the P1 transition\n(lower x-axis, see text). r \u22121 is also shown as a function of\nthe inverse conjugation length 1/n (upper x-axis), which was\ndetermined from P1 by the linear extrapolation of the data\nshown in Fig. 3 (see text). The line through the data points\nis a linear fit.\n\u22121\n\nBy linearly extrapolating the universal dependence of\nr\u22121 on n\u22121 we get r \u2248 1 for n \u2248 2(\u2248 7\u00c5 [23]). We\nconclude therefore that exciton formation should become\nspin-independent for oligomers of length \u2248 7\u00c5 or less.\nThis shows that \u03c3S \u2248 \u03c3T for small molecules, in agreement with the previous results in AlQ3 [2] and a Platinum\ncontaining phenylene-ethylene-type monomer [6], which\nwere deduced more directly from the EL quantum yield\nof OLEDs. Since the maximum quantum yield of OLED\nis related to r, then our results show that if all other factors are equal the quantum yield of polymer OLEDs is\nlarger than that of OLEDs based on small molecules; this\nconstitutes a clear advantage for the polymers.\nWe advance several speculations to explain the very\n\n[1] R.H.

It was indeed\nshown [18] that exceptionally low photon energy for the\nP1 band results from a delocalization of polarons not only\nalong the conjugated polymer backbone, but also in the\ntwo-dimensional lamellae. This suggests an interpretation of the \"larger than infinite\" CL as a situation where\nexcitations extend not only along the backbone, but also\nalong the perpendicular directions. It is however not entirely clear whether the linear extrapolation of the data\npresented in Fig. 3 to 1/n=0 is exactly valid. In any case\npolymers with low P1 band correspond to highly conjugated systems.\n[22] P. J Brown, H. Sirringhaus, M. Harrison, M. Shkunov\nand R. H. Friend, Phys. Rev. B 63, 125204 (2001).\n[23] J.
