INTRODUCTION\nSince the spin-transfer torque (STT) effect [1, 2] allows the control of magnetization direction by the\nspin-polarized current in nanostructures, it is raising to the possibility of novel device applications with\nthe STT effect, such as the current induced magnetization switching [3, 4], magnetic domain wall\n(DW) motion [5-12], magnetization precession [13, 14], and spin wave nucleation [15]. Among the\napplications, the race-track memory (RM) related to the current induced DW motion is attractive as a\nnext generation nonvolatile memory device which can substitute for the current hard disk drive. The\nRM has advantages of the high density compared with the hard disk drive and is suitable for the mobile\nmemory due to the nonvolatility. Furthermore, it has no mechanical part being a weakness of the\nconventional hard disk drive as a mobile storage [9]. The RM is operated by reading and writing of a\nbit data by moving the DW with the STT in ferromagnetic nanowires. There are many reports about the\nsuccessful DW motion by the STT [6-10], however, the velocity and reproducibility is far from\nsatisfactory [7, 8], and the high critical current density causes unwanted Joule heating problems [11,\n12]. The underlying physics of the current induced DW motion has not yet been properly investigated.\nMost of the studies related with the current induced DW motion are focused on the observation of the\nDW motion itself, by the magnetic domain imaging [6] or the transport measurements [7, 8]. In order to\nelucidate the interaction between localized non-collinear spins in the DW and the conducting polarized\nelectrons by STT, the basic information of the spins in the DW is essential and important for the\nefficient control of the DW.\nThe magnetic thermal noise due to the thermal magnetization fluctuations is related with the\nmagnetic susceptibility by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem [16]. From the magnetic susceptibility,\nwe can extract the important physical information such as the magnetization, anisotropy energy, and\ndamping parameters [17]. In addition, the noise measurement is also connected with the STT effects\n[18-21]. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no study about the noise spectra from the DW\n2\n\n\f[22].\nIn this study, we present the magnetic noise due to thermal fluctuations by employing micromagntic\nsimulations in ferromagnetic nanowires. We find that the noise spectra of the DW have a resonance\nfrequency distinguished from that of the single domain. We confirm that the resonance frequencies of\nthe single domain are well agreed with the Kittel's formula for the nanowires with various widths and\nthicknesses. However, the resonance frequency of the DW cannot be explained by a simple model, and\nit implies the effective field of the spins in the DW is quite different from that of the single domain.\n\nII. MICROMAGNETICS\nFor studying on magnetic noise in ferromagnetic nanowires, we performed the micromagnetic\nsimulation with object oriented micromagnetic framework (OOMMF) [23]. The spin dynamics is\ndescribed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation,\n\nd M / dt = \u2212 \u03b3 ( M \u00d7 H eff ) \u2212 \u03b1 / M s ( M \u00d7 d M / dt ) .\n\n(1)\n\nWhere \u03b3 , \u03b1 , M s , and H eff are the gyromagnetic ratio, Gilbert damping constant, saturation\nmagnetization, and the effective magnetic field, respectively. The effective magnetic field is defined as\n\nH eff = \u2212 \u03bc \u22121\u2202E / \u2202 M . The energy density E is a function of M specified by Brown's equations [24],\nincluding magnetic anisotropy, exchange, magnetostatic, and Zeeman energies due to the applied\nmagnetic field. Here, the archetypal LLG equation doesn't consider the motion of spin due to the\nrandom thermal fluctuation field, which always exists in the finite temperature and it is the source of\nthe magnetic thermal noise. In order to include the thermal noise effect, we employed the stochastic\nLLG equation with the thermal fluctuation term,\nd M / dt = \u2212 \u03b3 M \u00d7 ( H eff + h fl (t )) \u2212 \u03b1 / M s ( M \u00d7 d M / dt ) .\n\n(2)\n\nHere h fl (t ) is a highly irregular field term due to the Gaussian stochastic process. h fl (t ) has the\nstatistical properties, \u3008 h fl ,i (t )\u3009 = 0 and \u3008 h fl ,i (t ) h fl , j ( s ) \u3009 = 2 D\u03b4 ij \u03b4 (t \u2212 s ) , where i and j are Cartesian\n3\n\n\findices, the constant D measures the strength of the thermal fluctuations. Dirac \u03b4 represents that above\nfinite temperature the autocorrelation time of h fl (t ) is much shorter than the rotational-response time\nof the system, while the Kronecker \u03b4 represents that the different components of h fl (t ) are assumed to\nbe uncorrelated [25].\nMicromagnetic simulations are calculated for a magnetic structure divided by small cells. If a cell\nsize is small enough, the simulation is accurate but it takes longer simulation time. So the cell size must\nbe optimized by considering the accuracy and simulation time. Recently, it has been reported that the\nproper renormalization process is required for the physical quantities such as the saturation\nmagnetization [26]. Due to the finite cell size which is much larger than the atomic size, the\ncontribution of smaller wavelength magnon than the cell size cannot be properly considered in\nmicromagnetic simulations. To avoid this problem in the finite temperature, the renormalization\nprocess is necessary. In this work, however, we perform the simulation without the renormalization\nprocess at 300 K. We pay our attention to a qualitative behavior of the magnetic noise spectra and the\nresonance frequency, not a quantitative analysis. The quantitative results are not changed without the\nrenormalization process in our study.\nFor micromagnetic simulations, we select a model system of a 10-nm thick, 80-nm wide, and 1000nm long NiFe (permalloy, Py) nanowire. A tail-to-tail transverse DW is placed at center position with a\nsmall notch (5\u00d710 nm2), as shown in Fig. 1 (a). The notch traps the domain wall as a potential well, but\nthe effect on the resonance frequency is negligible when the size of notch is not large. The material\nparameter of Py is as follows: the saturation magnetization M s = 8.6 \u00d7 105 A/m, the exchange stiffness\nAex = 13 \u00d7 10 \u221212 J/m, and the Gilbert damping constant \u03b1 = 0.01 . We perform our simulations with a\n\nzero applied magnetic field and take a cell size of 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 nm3. Also, the thickness and width of the Py\nnanowire is varied from 10 to 30 nm with 5 nm steps for a fixed 80 nm width and from 50 to 120 nm\nwith 10 nm steps for a fixed 10 nm thickness, respectively. The DW structure of narrow magnetic\n4\n\n\fnanowires can be one of the transverse, vortex, and asymmetric transverse types depending on the\nthickness, width, and saturation magnetization due to the minimization of the demagnetization energy\n[27]. We limited the DW type as a symmetry transverse type by choosing the proper ranges of the\nthickness and width in our study. Because of a spatial symmetry of the vortex type DW, the sum of\nmagnetic noise from the whole vortex DW structure cancels each other and gives very small noise\nsignal, while the transverse type DW has better results. We obtained the spin configurations in the Py\nnanowires at each temporal moment for sufficiently long time (10-7 sec). The random thermal\nfluctuation field term is updated with the interval of 10-14 sec. The magnetization configurations are\nstored 10-11 sec steps. The resonance frequency due to the magnetic noise can be extracted by the fast\nFourier transform (FFT) from the time varying the transverse magnetization component (My).\n\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe resonance frequency due to magnetic fluctuations in the Py nanowires is calculated by\nemploying the OOMMF with the stochastic LLG equation [28]. First, we consider the 80-nm wide, 10nm thick, and 1000-nm long Py nanowire with a transverse type DW configuration as shown in Fig. 1\n(a). The temporal variation of the total My and the results of the FFT power of the total My is shown in\nFig. 1 (b) and (c), respectively. The random thermal motion of the magnetization due to the finite\ntemperature is clearly shown in Fig. 1 (b). We find two resonance frequencies at 7.1 and 9.4 GHz, as\nshown in Fig. 1 (c). It must be noted that there is only one peak (9.7 GHz) obtained for the single\ndomain case, as shown in Fig. 1 (d). The resonance frequency is well agreed with the Kittel's\nequation's result, 9.3 GHz. This equation employs the corresponding demagnetization factors of\nN x = 0.00248 , N y = 0.10932 , and N z = 0.8882 , with the relation of\n\nf =\n\n\u03b3\n\u00d7 ( H eff + ( N z \u2212 N x ) \u00d7 M s ) \u00d7 ( H eff + ( N y \u2212 N x ) \u00d7 M s ) .\n2\u03c0\n\n(3)\n\nHere Nx, Ny, and Nz are demagnetization factors for an corresponding ellipsoid [29]. To clarify the\n\n5\n\n\fsource of the additional peak (7.1 GHz), we employed the concept of the local spectra [22]. The local\nspectra are calculated from the limited region around the DW, as shown the black rectangle in Fig. 1 (a).\nIn order to obtain the local spectra, we consider the sums of only the local My instead of the sums of the\nMy for the whole region. With the local spectra analysis, we can confirm that the additional peaks are\ngenerated due to the DW. The additional peaks from the DW have distinguished resonance frequencies\nfrom that of the single domain. It implies the effective field acting on spins inside of the DW is\ndifferent from the inside of the single domain. Furthermore, the resonance frequency from the DW\ncannot be described with Kittel's formula, because the demagnetization factor cannot be determined for\nthe DW.\nIn order to reveal the behavior of the resonance frequency of the DW, we perform the same\nmicromagnetic simulations with various widths and thicknesses. In Fig. 2, we plotted the local spectra\nfrom (a) the transverse-type DW and (b) the single domain part for various wire widths (50 to 120 nm\nwith 10 nm steps). The decrement of the resonance frequencies with the wire-width variation is clearly\nobserved for the domain and DW, respectively. At Fig. 3 (a), the width dependence of the resonance\nfrequencies for the domain and DW is plotted with the calculated resonance frequencies with Eq. (3).\nThe agreements between the results of micromagnetic simulations and Eq. (3) are excellent. The\ncorresponding demagnetization factors are shown in Fig. 3 (b). For all width, N x ~ 0, and\n\nN x + N y + N z = 1 are hold, Eq. (3) can be rewritten as follows:\nf =\n\n\u03b3\n2\n\u00d7 ( H eff2 + M s H eff + N y (1 \u2212 N y ) M s ) .\n2\u03c0\n\n(4)\n\nIn this equation, it is clear that the resonance frequency only depends on N y (1 \u2212 N y ) term, and the\ncorresponding N y (1 \u2212 N y ) is depicted in the Fig. 3 (b). The relations between the resonance frequency\nand demagnetization factors are clear. However, it must be pointed out that even though the resonance\nfrequency of the DW shows the same trend, decreased with broadening the wire width, the dependence\n\n6\n\n\fof the resonance frequency of the DW is more complicated, which we will discuss later.\nNext, we perform the same micromagnetic simulations with various thicknesses (from 10 to 30 nm\nwith 5 nm steps) with a fixed width of 80 nm as shown in Fig. 4 (a) and (b). In this case, the thickness\ndependence of the resonance frequencies of the single domain and DW shows different behaviors.\nWhile the resonance frequencies of the single domain increase with increasing the wire thickness, those\nof the DW decrease. The agreements between micromagnetic simulations and Eq. (3) are still excellent\nas shown Fig. 5 (a). However, the resonance frequencies of the DW show the opposite behavior. In Fig.\n5 (b), corresponding demagnetization factors with N y (1 \u2212 N y ) are also depicted. Only the resonance\nfrequencies of the single domain can be explained with Eq. (4) and N y (1 \u2212 N y ) term, but that of the\nDW shows the different behavior.\nSince the resonance frequency of the ferromagnetic body is a function of the effective field and the\nmagnetization, the distinguished resonance frequency implies that the effective field inside of the DW\nis quite different to that of the single domain. Furthermore, the dependence of the width and thickness\nis different. Inside of the single domain, where the magnetizations are collinear, \u2207 \u22c5 M = 0 is satisfied.\nHowever, this condition is no longer valid inside of the DW, where the magnetization directions are\nabruptly changed. Furthermore, there are many free poles at the both side of the nanowire edges, it also\ngives additional stray field. Therefore, different effective fields for the spins inside of the DW are\nunderstandable. However, there is no simple analytic model for the realistic transverse type DW so that\nwe cannot estimate the effective field inside of the DW. In order to obtain better understanding of the\nresonance frequency of the DW, experimental radio-frequency measurements must be carried out.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nThe magnetic noise spectra due to thermal fluctuations in the Py nanowires are investigated by the\nOOMMF with the stochastic LLG equation. The Kittel's formula well elucidates the resonance\nfrequencies of the magnetic noise spectra with the variation of the wire width and thickness for the\n7\n\n\fsingle domain. We find that the resonance frequencies of the DW are distinguished from that of the\nsingle domain and confirm by the local spectra concept. The distinguishable resonance frequency of the\nDW implies that the spins inside of the DW have difference effective fields from that of the single\ndomain. We believe that the magnetic noise measurement and the analysis of the DW will give a better\nunderstanding of the spin dynamics for the spins inside of the DW.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\nThis research was supported by Nano R&D program (2008-02553, 2009-0082441) through the\nNational Research Foundation of Korea(NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and\nTechnology and the IT R&D program of MKE/KEIT (2009-F-004-01).\n\n8\n\n\fREREFENCES\n\n[1] J.
