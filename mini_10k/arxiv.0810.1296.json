Many three generation string\nmodels were found within a few years. The dominant view back then was that discovery of\nthe true string vacuum (model) was within reach\u2013that the string \"needle\" would eventually\nbe found within the stringstack of but a few trillion vacua. Eventually a handful of quite\nrealistic MSSM or Near-MMSM three generation models were indeed found [2], especially\nfollowing the first Minimal Standard Heterotic String Model [3].\nHowever, following the second string revolution the rise of M -theory has taught string\nphenomenologists the likely impossibility of finding a \"true\" string vacuum somewhere on\nthe string/M-landscape composed of at least 10500 vacua. In addition to the vast number\nof vacua, all vacua now appear to be on equal footing. Thus, the phenomenological goal\nhas shifted from studying individual string models to better understanding statistically the\ncharacteristics of the string/M-models on the landscape, or at least within specific domains\n[4].\nThe (often overlapping) domains on the landscape frequently correspond to model construction methods. One construction method that has been widely explored in terms of\nindividual models and for which large scale statistical studies are underway is free fermions\n[5, 6]. The free fermionic heterotic string has provided many quasi-realistic (Near-)MSSMlike models [7, 8, 9], semi-GUT models [10, 11], and GUT models [12]. In the context of the\nsecond string revolution, the important features to now investigate are the overall phenemological patterns within these and the many more, as yet undiscovered, free fermionic models.\nSeveral studies of the statistical properties and characteristics of free fermionic heterotic\nmodels are underway by different research groups [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18].\nAn algorithm to systematically and efficiently generate free fermionic heterotic models\nwas recently introduced [15]. As a first application, we have initiated an indepth study of\nthe statistics of the gauge groups in free fermionic heterotic strings. Our approach enables\na complete study of all gauge group models to be generated and analyzed with extreme\nefficiency, up to continually increasing Layers (the number of gauge basis vectors) and Orders (the lowest positive integer multiple N that transforms each basis vector back into the\nuntwisted sector mod(2)). Our algorithm significantly increases by several orders of magnitude the efficiency of a systematic statistical study of regions of the parameter space of\nfree fermionic heterotic models [15]. Nevertheless, current computational capabilities pose a\nserious limit to the range of parameter spaces that can be systematically investigated.\nThus, given an efficient and systematic method for generating the required input data for\na given string model construction method, such as the free fermionic heterotic approach, we\nconsider what the realistic bounds are for a statistical analysis of the Landscape with a classical computer. We then consider what kind of improvement could be expected on a quantum\ncomputer. We do outline the basic structure of the relevant quantum algorithms, but we\ndo not detail the construction of the oracle which would be involved in the calculations.\nSince we will be relating quantum computing techniques to free fermionic construction, we\nbriefly review in Section Two free fermionic heterotic model building and modular invariance\n1\n\n\fconstraints. Then in Section Three we review the general concepts of quantum computing.\nIn Section Four we discuss Grover's Quantum Search Algorithm, followed in Section Five by\nits application to the statistics of the free fermionic Landscape. Section Six concludes our\ndiscussions.\n\n2\n\nFree Fermionic Heterotic Models\n\nThe first object required to specify a model in the free fermionic heterotic string [5, 6] is\na set\nA = {~\n\u03b1i \u2208 Q64 \u2229 (\u22121, 1]64 |i \u2208 {1, ..., L \u2208 N}},\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere components \u03b1ji , j = 1, . . . , 20 are boundary conditions for real worldsheet free fermion\ndegrees of freedom of the left-moving supersymmetric string, and \u03b1ji for j = 21, . . . , 64 are\nboundary conditions for real worldsheet free fermion degrees of freedom on the right moving\nbosonic string. In the C basis (complex fermions), each component of \u03b1\n~ i is double counted,\nand \u03b1\n~ i is a 32 (10 + 22) component vector (which can be generalized to include left-right\npaired real fermions).\nThe order Ni of a given \u03b1\n~ i is defined as\u2217\nNi \u2261 min{m \u2208 N | m\u03b1ji = 0 mod 2 \u2200j},\n\n(2.2)\n\nNij \u2261 LCM(Ni , Nj ).\n\n(2.3)\n\nwith\n\nThus, each component of an \u03b1\n~ of order N is of the form\n2Z\n\u2229 [\u22121, 1)\nN\n\n(2.4)\n\nNi \u03b1\n~i * \u03b1\n~ i = 0 mod 8\nNij \u03b1\n~i * \u03b1\n~ j = 0 mod 4\n\n(2.5)\n(2.6)\n\n(~\n\u03b1)i \u2208\nModular Invariance demands\n\nin the C basis [5, 6], along with requiring that the number of real rermions simultaneously\nperiodic for any three basis vectors is even (including cases where one or more of the basis\nvectors may be the same). Further, each model contain \u03b1\n~ 1 = I, the 64 real-component vector\nwith every element equal to one.\nIn a given free fermionic model, the different sectors of a model are formed by all linear\ncombinations of the \u03b1\n~ i 's, with coefficients mk \u2208 N where each coefficient mki < Ni . Each\nlinear combination, or sector, is denoted\nV~ k =\n\nL\nX\n\nmki \u03b1\n~ i mod 2.\n\n(2.7)\n\ni=1\n\u2217\n\nWe include \"0\" in the set of natural numbers N as in set theory, in contrast to its general exclusion in\nnumber theory.\n\n2\n\n\fWe can (and will) think of each set of coefficients mk as an L-dimensional vector in NL ,\nwhose ith component is constrained by the order of \u03b1\n~ i.\nFor a given sector V~ k , a worldsheet fermion fj transforms as\nk\n\nfj \u2192 \u2212ei\u03c0Vj fj\n\n(2.8)\n\naround non-contractible loops on the worldsheet. Thus, for R fermions, Vjk must be either\n0 or 1, whereas for C fermions, Vjk must be rational. For each sector, we can form the U (1)\ncharges for the Cartan generators of the unbroken gauge groups (which are in one to one\ncorrespondence with the U (1) currents fj\u2217 fj for each complex fermion fj );\n~ ~ k \u2261 1 V~ k + F~ k\nQ\nV\n2\n\n(2.9)\n\nwhere F~ k is a fermion number operator which counts each mode of fj once and of fj\u2217 minus\nonce. Or, in other words, Fik \u2208 {\u22121, 0, 1} \u2200 i.\nThe second object required to specify a model in the free fermionic heterotic string is an\nL \u00d7 L matrix kij . Modular Invariance imposes the following constraints on kij ;\n1 i j\n~ *\u03b1\n~ mod 2\nkij + kji = \u03b1\n2\n1 i i\n~ *\u03b1\n~ \u2212 si mod 2\nkii + ki1 = \u03b1\n4\nNj kij = 0 mod 2,\n\n(2.10)\n(2.11)\n(2.12)\n\nwhere si is the 4 dimensional spacetime component of \u03b1\n~ i . Furthermore, kij \u2208 (\u22121, 1]. The\nGSO projection constraint for physical states is;\n~~k =\n\u03b1\n~i * Q\nV\n\nL\nX\n\nmkn kin + si mod 2.\n\n(2.13)\n\nn=1\n\nThis completes our review of the general construction the free fermionic heterotic string\nmodels. We now now consider how quantum computing could significantly aid a systematic\nstatistical study of this region (or of any other region) of the Landscape.\n\n3\n\nQuantum Computation\n\nIn the years since 1965 when Gordon Moore proposed it, Moore's Law has approximately\nheld true. However, due to the drastic decreases in processor size and the increasing effects\nof quantum mechanics, it appears that fundamental fabrication barriers lie in the not too\ndistant future.\u2020 The physical construction of classical computers seems to demand a \"smallest\nscale\" beyond which we cannot go, and it is likely that we will reach this scale in the next\ndecade or two.\nOne solution to this problem is to reformulate the physical construction of computers.\nOne such paradigm is provided by Quantum Computation. The basic idea of Quantum\n\u2020\n\nThe content of this introduction comes primarily from [19] and [20]\n\n3\n\n\fComputation is that that the smallest unit of information is not a bit, but rather is a\nquantum bit, or q-bit, which can exist in a superposition of 1 and 0 at the same time;\n|\u03a8i = \u03b1|0i + \u03b2|1i,\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n1\n0\n2\n2\nwhere |\u03b1| + |\u03b2| = 1, and |1i =\nand\nare the computational basis vectors.\n0\n1\nThere then exists a set of universal quantum gates which, similarly to the classical universal gates, can be used to build an arbitrary operation on a set of q-bits. As an example of\nwhy such a system is useful, consider one such universal quantum gate, the Hadamard gate\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 1 1\n(3.1)\nH=\u221a\n2 1 \u22121\nacting on each q-bit in an n q-bit register |0i\u2297n = |0i1 |0i2 * * * |0in . This will give\nn\n\nH\n\n\u2297n\n\n\u2297n\n\n|0i\n\n2 \u22121\n1 X \u2297n\n=\u221a\n|ii ,\n2n i=0\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere i runs over all 2n n q-bit states. With a classical computer, we could act on a single\nn bit register with some operator C, taking C|ii\u2297n \u2192 |i0 i\u2297n , and this operator must be\nused once for every possible input. However, with the quantum computer, we can act on\nthe superposition (3.2) a single time with some operator U (we use U because quantum\noperators must be Unitary), and\nn\n\nU H \u2297n |0i\u2297n\n\n2 \u22121\n1 X 0 \u2297n\n|i i\n=\u221a\n2n i=0\n\n(3.3)\n\nwill be a superposition of every outcome at once. So using only n q-bits, and a single use of\nU , we have 2n transformations.\nWhile this is impressive, there is a serious drawback. While this paradigm offers a massive\nparallelism, we obviously don't have access to every state in the superposition. All we can\ndo is make a measurement of each q-bit, and we have equal probability of getting any n q-bit\nstate. Getting a practical result out of a quantum computer therefore takes quite a bit more\nwork. We mention this example merely to give an idea of how quantum mechanics could be\nused in computation.\nDespite decades of work, there has been relatively little progress made in developing\nalgorithms for quantum computers. One problem is that a quantum algorithm is only acceptable if it offers a speedup over the fastest classical algorithms. Another problem is that\nall of our intuitions come from the classical (looking) world we experience, and therefore\nwe lack clarity in \"thinking quantum\" in order to design algorithms. However, there are a\nfew quantum algorithms that have been developed and which offer a significant increase in\nefficiency over their classical counterparts. These existing algorithms could potentially be\nused in generating statistics on the free fermionic heterotic Landscape. We will therefore\noutline how these algorithms work, and discuss what type of improvement they would offer\nin such an analysis. To date, there are no quantum computers in active operation. However,\nit is likely that in the next few decades their production will allow for applications like the\none discussed in this paper.\n4\n\n\f4\n\nQuantum Algorithms\n\nFor a more detailed exposition of the nature of quantum gates and their physical construction, see [19], which we follow closely in this section. It should be assumed that all of\nthe gates discussed below are realizable.\n4.1\n\nQuantum Fourier Transform\n\nThe first quantum operation we consider is the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) [19].\nThe action of the QFT on an n q-bit state |ji\u2297n is defined by\nn\n\n|ji\n\n\u2297n\n\n2 \u22121\n1 X (2\u03c0i)jk\n\u221a\n\u2192\ne 2n |ki\u2297n .\nn\n2 k=0\n\n(4.1)\n\nBut we can re-express this as\nn\n\n\u2297n\n\n|ji\n\n2 \u22121\n1 X (2\u03c0i)jk\n\u2192 \u221a\ne 2n |ki\u2297n\nn\n2 k=0\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n|0i + e2\u03c0i0.jn |1i |0i + e2\u03c0i0.jn\u22121 jn * * * |0i + e2\u03c0i0.j1 j2 ***jn |1i\n\u221a\n,\n=\n2n\n\n(4.2)\n(4.3)\n\njm\nwhere 0.jk jk+1 * * * jm \u2261 j2k + jk+1\nis the binary fraction for j, where each ji is\n+ * * * 2m\u2212k+1\n4\ndefined by j = j1 2n\u22121 + j2 2n\u22122 + * * * + jn 20 .\n\n4.2\n\nPhase Estimation\n\nSuppose we have some unitary operator U with eigenvector |ui and eigenvector e2\u03c0i\u03c6 ,\nwhere \u03c6 is unknown. We can use the QFT (4.3) to estimate \u03c6 to arbitrary accuracy [19].\nWe assume that we have oracles which will both prepare the state |ui as well as perform\nj\na controlled-U 2 operation for non-negative integers j. We then prepare a register with n\nq-bits all in the state |0i (|0i\u2297n ), where n depends on how accurately we want to estimate\n\u03c6, and a second register in the state |ui, or\n|0i\u2297n |ui.\n\n(4.4)\n\nWe act on each of the q-bits in the first register with a Hadamard gate (3.1), creating\nthe state\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1\n\u221a\n|0i + |1i |0i + |1i * * * |0i + |1i |ui.\n(4.5)\n2n\nNext, we act on the second register, |ui, with a controlled-U operation with U raised to\nsuccessive powers of 2, creating the state\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1\nn\u22121\nn\u22122\n0\n\u221a\n|0i + e2\u03c0i2 \u03c6 |1i |0i + e2\u03c0i2 \u03c6 |1i * * * |0i + e2\u03c0i2 \u03c6 |1i |ui\n2n\n2n \u22121\n1 X (2\u03c0i)k\u03c6\n=\u221a\ne\n|ki|ui.\n2n k=0\n5\n\n(4.6)\n\n\fFinally, we can do an inverse QFT to the first register, taking\nn\n\n2 \u22121\n1 X (2\u03c0i)k\u03c6\n\u221a\ne\n|ki|ui \u2192 |\u03c6\u0303i|ui,\n2n k=0\n\n(4.7)\n\nwhere \u03c6\u0303 is an estimator for \u03c6 when the first register is measured. If n q-bits are used in the\nfirst register (as indicated above), then this algorithm will accurately approximate \u03c6 to\n\u0018\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0019\n1\n(4.8)\nn \u2212 log2 2 +\n2\u000f\nbits with probability 1 \u2212 \u000f.\n4.3\n\nGrover's Quantum Search Algorithm\n\nWe now consider the algorithm at the heart of our application to superstring model\nbuilding statistics, Grover's search algorithm [19] [20] [21]. The idea is that we start with\na space of N = 2n elements which we want to search through. We index the elements in\nthe space, which requires n bits. We are looking for elements which satisfy some specific\ncriterion, of which assume there are M in the search space.\nNext, we define what is called an oracle, which is a function f (x) which takes an n-bit\nvalue x \u2208 {0, . . . N \u2212 1}, and has the value f (x) = 0 if x is not one of the M solutions, and\nthe value f (x) = 1 if x is one of the M solutions. We will not concern ourselves with the\nconstruction of the oracle in this section or the next. We simply assume its existence.\nThe actual operation of the oracle is as follows; given an n + 1 q-bit state prepared as\n\u2297n\n|xi |yi, the oracle operator O makes the transformation\nO|xi\u2297n |0i = |xi\u2297n |y \u2295 f (x)i\n\n(4.9)\n\n(where \u2295 denotes addition mod 2). In other words, O changes the value of the last q-bit iff\nx is a solution.\nA more useful application of this is to prepare the last q-bit\nin the state |0i and do a\n\u0001\n1\nHadamard transformation (3.1). Defining |\u2212i \u2261 \u221a2 |0i \u2212 |1i , we then have\nO|xi\u2297n |\u2212i = (\u22121)f (x) |xi|\u2212i.\n\n(4.10)\n\nTo carry out the actual search algorithm, the computer is prepared in the state |0i\u2297n |\u2212i,\nand the each of the first n states are acted on by Hadamard gates, producing\nn\n\n2 \u22121\n1 X\n|xi|\u2212i.\n|\u03c8i = \u221a\n2n x=0\n\n(4.11)\n\nTo this state we apply the \"Grover Operator\" G defined as\nG \u2261 H \u2297n (2|0ih0| \u2212 I)H \u2297n O = (2|\u03c8ih\u03c8| \u2212 I)O.\n\n6\n\n(4.12)\n\n\fLet |\u03b1iPbe the normalized superposition of all states which\nare not solutions, |\u03b1i =\nP\n1\n1\n\u221a\n\u221a\nx3f (x)=0 |xi, and |\u03b2i those that are, |\u03b2i =\nx3f (x)=1 |xi. Then, (4.11) can\nN \u2212M\nM\nbe written as\nr\nr\nN \u2212M\nM\n|\u03b1i +\n|\u03b2i.\n(4.13)\n|\u03c8i =\nM\nN\n(we have dropped |\u2212i for notational simplicity).\nIt is clear that O is a reflection in the (|\u03b1i, |\u03b2i) plane about |\u03b1i, and that 2|\u03c8ih\u03c8| \u2212 I is\na reflection in the same plane about |\u03c8i. So, G is a rotation in the (|\u03b1i, |\u03b2i) plane. If we\ndefine\nr\nN \u2212M\n\u03b8\n,\n(4.14)\ncos \u2261\n2\nN\nthen k successive applications of G will produce the state\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2k + 1\n2k + 1\nk\nG |\u03c8i = cos\n\u03b8 |\u03b1i + sin\n\u03b8 |\u03b2i.\n(4.15)\n2\n2\nq\nN\nIf we do approximately k = \u03c04 M\napplications of G, we will have rotated the state very\nnear |\u03b2i, so that measurement of |\u03c8i will give a solution with high probability. So,p\nwhereas\nwith a classical computer, O(N/M ) applications of the oracle are needed, only O( N/M )\nare needed with the quantum computer.\n4.4\n\nQuantum Counting\n\nFinally we review the Quantum Counting algorithm [19], which combines ideas from the\nprevious sections. Grover's algorithm required that we know both the total search space N ,\nas well as the number of solutions M . But, it is possible that M is not known in advance. In\nthis case, there is a fast quantum algorithm which will calculate M to high probability. The\nprimary idea is to use the phase estimation algorithm of section 4.2 to find the eigenvalue\nof the Grover operator G, from which we can calculate \u03b8 (cf. section 4.3), and therefore M\n(assuming we know N ). The eigenvalues of the Grover operator G in the space spanned by\n|\u03b1i and |\u03b2i are e\u00b1i\u03b8 . We can therefore use the phase estimation algorithm to find an estimate\nfor \u03b8 to whatever accuracy we wish. Once \u03b8 is obtained, we can use (4.14) to find M .\n\n5\n\nStatistics on the Free Fermionic Landscape\nIn [15] we found that for a given layer L and total order product\nA\u2261\n\nL\nY\n(Ni ) \u2212 1,\n\n(5.1)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere Ni are the respective orders of the i = 1, . . . L \u03b1\n~ i 's, the number of modular invariant\ninput sets can be approximated by\n\u0013\n\u0012Y\nL Y\ni\u22121\n\u0393(23 + A)\n.\n(5.2)\nB=\nNij L\n2 A!(A + 1)L \u0393(23)\ni=1 j=1\n7\n\n\fCollecting statistics then consists of analyzing each model, looking for occurrences of a\nparticular gauge group. In other words, if we want to know what percentage of all layer\nL and order A sets contain a group M , we must analyze all B sets. So, given an oracle\nwhich takes a set of \u03b1\n~ i 's and returns 1 if M is produced and 0 otherwise, the oracle must\nbe invoked B times to get an exact statistic. Obviously there will be a limit on A and L,\nbeyond which we can no longer perform comprehensive investigations. Graphing (5.2) vs. A\nlogarithmically (at L = 1),\n\nwe see that the computational limit will be between 20 and 25.\nWith a quantum computer, however, we can combine Grover's algorithm (section 4.3) and\nthe phase estimation algorithm (section 4.2) to improve our search capabilities drastically.\nEquation (5.2) gives us a good approximation for the total number of possibilities at a given\nL and A, and therefore all we need to know is the phase of the Grover operator eigenvalue\nfor an oracle that returns 1 for group M , and we can calculate the percentage of sets (at\nthat L and A) that will contain M .\nFor L and A, we can index each set using at most log2 (B) q-bits. So, equation (4.8)\ndemands that the first register in our phase estimation algorithm contain\n\u0013\u0019\n\u0018\n\u0012\n1\n,\n(5.3)\nk = log2 B + log2 2 +\n2\u000f\nand therefore the phase estimation will involve only k invocations of the oracle. So, if we\nwant to measure the eigenvalue with 99% probability, our phase estimation procedure will\nonly involve\nk = log2\n\n\u0014\u0012 Y\nL Y\ni\u22121\ni=1 j=1\n\n\u0013\nNij\n\n\u0015\n\u0393(23 + A)\n+ 6.\n2L A!(A + 1)L \u0393(23)\n\nWe can graph k vs. A logarithmically (at L = 1),\n\n8\n\n(5.4)\n\n\fwhich is obviously a drastic improvement over the classical approach. We can see the improvement more clearly by graphing Bk :\n\n6\n\nConclusion\n\nWhen Grovers search algorithm is combined with the phase finding algorithm based on\nthe quantum Fourier transform, an enormous improvement in the depth of statistical analysis\non the free fermionic heterotic string Landscape over classical computation can be obtained.\nThe massive parallelism made possible by the superposition of states would render such a\nstatistical search effectively unbounded. However, because quantum computing is still in its\ninfancy and no quantum computers are in operation, the purpose of this paper is merely\nto outline a specific application of an already existing quantum computing algorithm for a\npotential future use in string theory.\n\n7\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nResearch funding leading to this manuscript was partially provided by Baylor URC grant\n0301533BP.\n9\n\n\fReferences\n[1] For an overview of string model construction methods developed during the first string\ntheory era, see D.
