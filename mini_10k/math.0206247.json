In this paper we prove a general theorem concerning the number of translation\nclasses of curves of genus g belonging to a fixed cohomology class in a polarized abelian variety\nof dimension g. For g = 2 we recover results of G\u00f6ttsche and Bryan-Leung. For g = 3 we deduce\nexplicit numbers for these classes.\n\n1. Introduction.\nLet (A, L) be a polarized abelian variety of dimension g and of type (d1 , . . . , dg ) over the\nfield C of complex numbers. Two curves, C1 and C2 in A are called equivalent, if there is an\nx \u2208 A such that C1 = tx C2 . Here tx : A \u2192 A denotes the translation by x. We call a class\nof equivalent curves in A a translation class of curves. Equivalent curves in A define the\n2g\u22122\nsame\n(A, Z). Let r \u2208 Q, r > 0 such that the cohomology class\nVg\u22121cohomology class in H 2g\u22122\nr\nc1 (L) is contained in H\n(A, Z). It is easy to see that the\nnumber of translation\nVg\u22121\nc1 (L) is finite. The\nclasses of irreducible reduced curves of genus g in the class r\nproblem is to compute this number.\n\nIn the case of an abelian surface this problem is equivalent to computing the number of\ncurves of genus 2 in a linear system |L|. In fact, if L is of type (d1 , d2 ), then |L| contains\nexactly d21 * d22 curves which are equivalent to a given curve of genus 2. The number of\ncurves of genus 2 in |L| has been computed in the special case of a simple abelian surface\nof type (1, d) by G\u00f6ttsche and Debarre in [G] and [D] and finally by Bryan and Leung in\n[BrL], applying intersection cohomology methods.\nIn this paper we prove a general theorem (Theorem\n2.1) expressing the number of equivVg\u22121\nalence classes of curves of genus g in the class r\nc1 (L) \u2208 H 2g\u22122 (A, Z) in terms of\nmaximal isotropic subgroups of Jacobian type of a finite symplectic space associated to\nL. For the definitions see Section 2. In dimension g \u2265 4 it is difficult to decide whether\na given maximal isotropic subgroup is of Jacobian type. However any maximal isotropic\nsubgroup of a simple abelian variety of dimension 2 and 3 is of Jacobian type. For these\nabelian varieties the theorem can be applied to actually compute the number of translation classes of curves in a fixed cohomology class. For abelian surfaces we obtain the\nresults of G\u00f6ttsche, Debarre and Bryan-Leung in a slightly more general form. The main\napplication of the theorem is dimension 3, where we compute the number of translation\nclasses of curves of genus 3 for any minimal cohomology class in H 4 (A, Z) and any simple\nabelian threefold. It would be interesting to find generating functions for these numbers.\nWe would like to thank the referee for suggesting some improvements in the proof of\n\n\f2. Statements of the results.\nFirst we recall some preliminaries. By a curve we will always mean a complete reduced\nirreducible curve. By its genus we understand its geometric genus, i.e. the genus of its\nnormalization. A polarization on an abelian variety A is by definition the first Chern class\nof an ample line bundle L on A. By abuse of notation we denote the polarization by L\ninstead of c1 (L) and consider it as a line bundle. For any polarization L on A the group\nK(L) is defined to be the kernel of the isogeny\nb x 7\u2192 t\u2217 L \u2297 L\u22121 .\n\u03c6L : A \u2192 A,\nx\n\nIf L is of type (d1 , . . . , dg ), then K(L) \u2243 (Z/d1 Z\u00d7. . .\u00d7Z/dg Z)2 . The group K(L) admits a\nnondegenerate (multiplicative) alternating form eL : K(L) \u00d7 K(L) \u2192 C\u2217 , so that one can\nspeak of totally isotropic subgroups of K(L) which we will shortly call isotropic subgroups.\nAccording to [CAV], Corollary 6.3.5 there is a canonical bijection between the sets of\n(i) maximal isotropic subgroups of K(L) and\n(ii) isogenies f : (A, L) \u2192 (B, M) of polarized abelian varieties (i.e. with f \u2217 M algebraic\nequivalent to L) onto a principally polarized abelian variety (B, M).\nWe call a maximal isotropic subgroup of Jacobian type if the associated principally polarized abelian variety (B, M) is the Jacobian of a smooth projective curve.\nb on the dual abelian\nFor any polarization L on A there is a unique dual polarization L\nb\nvariety A, characterized by the following 2 equivalent properties (see [BL]).\nb \u2248 Ld1 dg\n(i) \u03c6\u2217L L\n\n(ii) \u03c6Lb \u03c6L = d1 dg idA .\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\nd1 dg\nd1 dg\nb\nHere \"\u2248\" denotes algebraic equivalence. The polarization L is of type d1 , dg\u22121 , . . . , d2 , dg ,\nb\nb \u2248 L. The main result of the\nif L is of type (d1 , . . . , dg ). Moreover, one has biduality: L\npaper is the following theorem:\nTheorem 2.1. Let (A, L) be a polarizedVabelian variety of dimension g \u2265 2 and type\n(d1 , . . . , dg ) and r \u2208 Q, r > 0, such that r g\u22121 c1 (L) \u2208 H 2g\u22122 (A, Z). There is a canonical\nbijection between the sets of\nV\n(1) translation classes of curves of genus g in the class r g\u22121 c1 (L).\nbr(g\u22121)!d2 ***dg\u22121 ) of Jacobian type.\n(2) maximal isotropic subgroups in K(L\n\nHere for g = 2 the empty product d2 * * * dg\u22121 is considered to be equal to 1.\nNote that, since a general abelian variety of dimension \u2265 4 is not isogenous to a Jacobian, for such an (A, L) the cardinalities of the sets (1) and (2) of the theorem are both\nequal to 0. In particular, a generic polarized abelian variety of dimension g \u2265 4 does not\ncontain any curve of genus g. On the other hand it is difficult to decide whether a given\n\n\fof the theorem is for abelian varieties of dimensions 2 and 3.\nIt is well known (see e.g. [CAV], Corollary 11.8.2) that any simple principally polarized\nabelian variety of dimension 2 or 3 is the Jacobian of a nonsingular curve. Hence for g = 2\nand 3 any maximal isotropic subgroup of a simple abelian variety is of Jacobian type. So\nin these cases we can be more precise.\nCorollary 2.2: Let (A, L) be a simple abelian surface of type (d1 , d2 ). The number of\ncurves of genus 2 in the linear system |L| is d21 d22 *#{maximal isotropic subgroup of K(L)}.\nNote\nP that if L is of type (1, d), the number of maximal isotropic subgroups is \u03c3(d) =\nm|d m (see Proposition 4.3).\n\nProof. It remains to show that the number of curves in |L| equivalent to a given curve\nC \u2208 |L| of genus 2 is d21 d22 . But if C \u2032 is equivalent to C then C \u2032 = t\u2217x C for some x \u2208 A.\nThis implies x \u2208 K(L). Since K(L) is of order d21 d22 , it suffices to show that t\u2217x C 6= C\nfor any x \u2208 A, x 6= 0. But if t\u2217x C = C, then t\u2217x has to map the finite set of singularities\nof C into itself. This is impossible for x 6= 0, if we replace C by a suitable translate. In\nfact, replacing C by t\u2217x0 C for a general x0 , we obtain the identity t\u2217x\u2212x0 (t\u2217x0 C) = t\u2217x0 C with\nx \u2212 x0 not a division point and such a translation tx\u2212x0 cannot stabilize a finite set of\npoints.\n\u0003\nDenote by K(d1 , . . . , dg ) the group (Z/d1 Z \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 Z/dg Z)2 together with the standard\nsymplectic form e : K(d1 , . . . , dg )2 \u2192 C\u2217 defined as follows.

The number\nof translation classes of curves of genus 3 in the class r 2 c1 (L) for some r \u2208 Q, r > 0 is\nequal to the number of maximal isotropic subgroups of K(2rd1 d2 , 2rd1d3 , 2rd2 d3 ).\nV\nIn particular the number of equivalence classes of curves of genus 3 in 2d11d2 2 c1 (L) is\n\u0010\n\u0011\nequal to the number of maximal isotropic subgroups of K dd32 , dd13 . If L is of type (d, d, d),\nV\nthen there is exactly one class of curves of genus 3 in the class 2d12 2 c1 (L).\n3. Proof of the theorem.\nWe need some preliminaries. Let (A, L) be a polarized abelian variety of dimension g and\nC a curve of genus g in A generating A. Then we have the following diagram\ne\nC\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u2193\n\ne\n\u0592\u2192 J = J(C)\n\u2193f\n\n(1)\n\n\fe and f the homomorphism\nwhere \u03bd denotes the normalization map, J the Jacobian of C,\n\u03bd\ne\ne is of genus\ninduced by the composed map C \u2192 C \u0592\u2192 A. Note that f is an isogeny, since C\ng and C generates A as an abelian variety. Let M denote a line bundle on J defining the\ncanonical principal polarization on J.\nLemma 3.1: For any e \u2208 N the following statements are equivalent:\n(i)\n(ii)\n\nf \u2217 L \u2261 M e deg L .\nVg\u22121\ne\n[C] = (g\u22121)!\nc1 (L) in H 2g\u22122 (A, Z).\n\nHere \u2261 denotes numerical equivalence and the degree of L is defined as deg L = d1 . . . dg\nif L is of type (d1 , . . . , dg ).\nProof. Note first that (i) is equivalent to f\u02c6\u03c6L f = e deg L * 1J , i.e. to the commutativity\nof the diagram\n\u03c6L\nb\nA\n\u2212\u2192\nA\nf\n\n\u2191\n\nJ\n\n\u2193 f\u02c6\n\n(e deg L)J\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\n(2)\n\nJ,\n\nb We claim that (2) is\nwhere we identify J = Jb under the isomorphism \u03c6M : J \u2192 J.\nequivalent to\nf f\u02c6\u03c6L = e deg L * 1J .\n(3)\nFor the proof note that being an isogeny f : J \u2192 A is an isomorphim in HomQ (J, A) =\nHom(J, A) \u2297Z Q. Hence (2) is equivalent to\nf\u02c6\u03c6L = e deg L * f \u22121 .\nwhich in turn is equivalent to (3).\nRecall from [CAV] Section 5.4 that for any cycles V and W of complementary dimensions\none defines an endomorphism \u03b4(V, W ) of A by\n\u03b4(V, W )(x) = S(V * (t\u2217x W \u2212 W ))\nP\nP\nwhere S(V * (t\u2217x W \u2212 W )) = ni=1 ri xi \u2208 A if V * (t\u2217x W \u2212 W ) = ni=1 ri xi as a zero-cycle.\nMoreover \u03b4(V, W ) depends only on the algebraic equivalence classes of V and W . In\nparticular \u03b4(C, L) is a well defined endomorphism of A.\nNow assume (3) holds. Then\n\u03b4(C, L) = \u2212f f\u02c6\u03c6L\n= \u2212e deg L * 1A\n!\ng\u22121\n^\ne\nc1 (L), L)\n= \u03b4\n(g \u2212 1)!\n\nby [CAV], Prop. 11.6.1\nby (3)\nby [CAV], Prop. 5.4.7\n\nSince L is an ample line bundle this implies using [CAV], Theorem 11.6.4 that C is\n\n\fhomological equivalence coincide on an abelian variety.\nConversely (ii) implies\ng\u22121\n^\ne\n\u03b4( c1 (L), L)\n\u03b4(C, L) =\n(g \u2212 1)!\n\naccording\nto a theorem of Matsusaka (see [M]). But as above \u03b4(C, L) = \u2212f f\u02c6\u03c6L and\nVg\u22121\n\u03b4(\nc1 (L), L) = \u2212(g \u2212 1)! deg L.

Maximal isotropic subgroups.\nSuppose d1 , ..., dg are positive integers with di |di+1 for i = 1, ..., g\u22121 and let K(d1 , ..., dg ) =\n(Z/d1 Z \u00d7 ... \u00d7 Z/dg Z)2 denote the finite group with the standard symplectic form e( . , . )\nof Section 2. Recall that a subgroup H \u2282 K(d1 , ..., dg ) is called (totally) isotropic if\ne(h, h\u2032 ) = 1 for all h, h\u2032 \u2208 H. An isotropic subgroup of K(d1 , ..., dg ) is maximal isotropic\nif and only if it is of order d := d1 . . . dg . Let\n\u03bd(d1 , ..., dg )\ndenote the number of maximal isotropic subgroups of K(d1 , ..., dg ). In this section we\ncompute the number \u03bd(d1 , ..., dg ) in some cases. First note that from the definition of the\nsymplectic form e( * , * ) we immediately obtain\nProposition 4.1: Let d\u20321 , ..., d\u2032g be another set of positive integers with d\u2032i |d\u2032i+1 for i =\n1, ..., g. If (dg , d\u2032g ) = 1 then there is a symplectic isomorphism\nK(d1 d\u20321 , ..., dg d\u2032g ) \u2243 K(d1 , ..., dg ) \u00d7 K(d\u20321 , ..., d\u2032g ).\nIn particular \u03bd(d1 d\u20321 , ..., dg d\u2032g ) = \u03bd(d1 , ..., dg ) * \u03bd(d\u20321 , ..., d\u2032g ).\nProposition 4.2: \u03bd(p, ..., p) =\n\nQg\n\ni=1 (p\n\ni\n\n+ 1) for any prime number p.\n\nProof: According to Witt's theorem the group Sp(2g, p) acts transitively on the set of\nmaximal isotropic subgroups of K(p, * * * , p).

It is well-known that (Z/dZ)2 contains exactly \u03c3(d) subgroups of order d. \u0003\nIn the remaining cases it is a little more difficult to compute the number \u03bd(d1 , ..., dg ),\nmainly because it may happen that there are maximal isotropic subgroups of different\ntypes. We do this only for K(d1 , d2 ) which turns out to be sufficient in order to determine\nthe number of equivalence classes of curves of genus 3 in any primitive cohomology class\nof an abelian threefold.\nIn order to compute \u03bd(d, d) it suffices according to Proposition 4.1 to compute \u03bd(pn , pn )\nfor every prime power pn . The different types of maximal isotropic subgroups of K(pn , pn )\nare listed in the following table together with a typical example.

The alternating forms \u1ebdn\nform a projective system and define an alternating form \u1ebd : (Zp )4 \u00d7 (Zp )4 \u2212\u2192 Zp (Here\nZp denotes the ring of p-adic integers). The symplectic group Sp4 (Zp ) acts transitively\non the set of maximal isotropic subgroups of (Zp )4 . Let S denote the stabilizer of a fixed\nmaximal isotropic subgroup. The set of all maximal isotropic subgroups of (Zp )4 can\nbe identified with the smooth scheme M := Sp4 (Zp )/S over Zp . The maximal isotropic\nsubgroups of (Z/pn Z)4 can be considered as the Z/pn Z-valued points of the scheme M.\nSince for any smooth scheme N of relative dimension d over Zp the Z/pn Z-valued points\nand the Z/pZ-valued points of N are related by\n#N(Z/pn Z) = pd(n\u22121) * #N(Z/pZ)\nand since M is of relative dimension 3 over Zp , Proposition 4.2 implies assertion (1).\nAssertions (4), (5) and (6) can be deduced from (1), (2) and (3) using the following\nremark: If W \u2282 K(pn , pn ) is any isotropic subgroup then the maximal isotropic subgroups\ncontaining W are in natural bijection with the maximal isotropic subgroups of W \u22a5 /W .\nThus we find: \u03bd(pn , pn )(4k,l) = \u03bd(pn\u22122l , pn\u22122l )(2k\u2212l ), \u03bd(pn , pn )(5l ) = \u03bd(pn\u22122l , pn\u22122l )(3) and\n\u03bd(pn , pn )(6k ) = \u03bd(pn\u22122k , pn\u22122k )(1).\n\u0003\nIt is easy to make a similar computation for \u03bd(pm , pn ) with m < n. However there are\nconsiderably more types of maximal isotropic subgroups to distinguish. We omit the\ncorresponding tables and formulas.

Curves in a minimal cohomology class.\nLet (A, L) be a polarized abelian variety of type\n(d1 , ..., dg ). Let c1 (L) denote the cohoVg\u22121\nmology class of the line bundle L. The class\nc1 (L) \u2208 H 2g\u22122 (A, Z) is divisible by\nVg\u22121\n1\nc1 (L) is not divisible in H 2g\u22122 (A, Z) and\n(g \u2212 1)!d1 * * * dg\u22121 . The class (g\u22121)!d1 ***dg\u22121\nis called the minimal cohomology class (of dimension 1) in (A, L) (This follows easily\nfrom the fact that for a suitable\nPgchoice of a real basis x1 , . . . , x2g of the tangent space\nof A at 0 we have c1 (L) = \u2212 i=1 di dxi \u2227 dxg+i (see [CAV], Lemma 3.6.4)). Denote\nby Nmin (d1 , ..., dg ) the number of translation classes of curves of genus g in the minimal\ncohomology class of (A, L). If L\u2032 is a d1 -th root of L, then L\u2032 defines a polarization of\ntype (1, dd21 , ..., ddg1 ) and the minimal cohomology classes in (A, L) and (A, L\u2032 ) coincide. In\nparticular we have Nmin (d1 , ..., dg ) = Nmin (1, dd12 , ..., ddg1 ). Hence we may always assume\nthat (A, L) is of type (1, d2 , ..., dg ).\nIn the case of an abelian surface (A, L) of type (1, d) the minimal cohomology class\nis the polarization c1 (L) itself. In this case the number Nmin (1, d) has been computed\nby G\u00f6ttsche [G], Debarre [D] and Bryan - Leung [BL]. Theorem 2.1 and Proposition 4.3\nyield\nd2\nNmin (d1 , d2 ) = \u03c3( )\nd1\nNote that the results of Section 4 also give the number of translation classes of curves of\ngenus 2 in non minimal cohomology classes of abelian surfaces.\nNow let (A, L) be a simple abelian threefold of type (1, d2, d3 ). Recall from Section\n4 that \u03bd(m, n) denotes the number of maximal isotropic subgroups of K(m, n), hence it\nequals the number of maximal isotropic subgroups of K(1, m, n). So Corollary 2.3 yields\nNmin (1, d2 , d3 ) = \u03bd(\n\nd3\n, d3 )\nd2\n\n(4)\n\nand we obtain from Proposition 4.3:\nProposition 5.1: For any simple abelian threefold (A, L) of type (1, d, d) we have\nNmin (1, d, d) = \u03c3(d).\nSimilarly we have\nProposition 5.2: Let (A, L) be a simple abelian threefold of type (1, 1, d) and d =\nQ\nr\nni\ni=1 pi the prime decomposition.

Thus we get\nNmin (1, 1, d) =\n\nr\nY\n\n\u03bd(pni i , pni i ).\n\ni=1\n\nThe expression for \u03bd(p2m\u22121 , p2m\u22121 ) and \u03bd(p2m , p2m ) is obtained by adding the appropriate\nterms in Proposition 4.4.\n\u0003\nSimilar formulas can be given for Nmin (1, d2, d3 ) for d2 < d3 . We omit them since\nthey look more complicated. But note that the table on page 9 gives Nmin (1, d2 , d3 ) in\nsome cases. For example Nmin (1, 2, 4) = 51 etc.\n\nReferences:\n[BL] Ch. Birkenhake, H.
