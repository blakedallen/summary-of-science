These fields were used to study a\nfree falling particle motion in a Schwarzschild spacetime [4], and a charged\nparticle motion in Kaluza-Klein manifolds [5]. In this paper we present a\nmap building method among manifolds. As an application, we have chosen,\nfor their importance, a map between a n-dimensional general Riemannian\nmanifold and a n-dimensional maximally symmetric spacetime.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we present some facts about\nthe Jacobi fields. In Sec. 3 we build the Jacobi equation in a vielbein basis.\nIn Sec. 4 we modify the Hamiltonian formalism to a new version, that we\ncall the modified Hamiltonian formalism. In Sec. 5 we build a map among\nmanifolds by the use of the modified Hamiltonian formalism for the Jacobi\nfields on a geodesic curve.. In Sec. 6 we apply the modified Hamiltonian\nformalism to the Jacobi fields on a non-geodesic curve. In Sec. 7 we apply\nthe modified formalism to metric tensors. In Sec. 8 we summarize the main\nresults of this work.\n\n2\n\nJacobi Fields\n\nIn this section we briefly review the Jacobi fields and their respective\ndifferential equation for a Riemann manifold. Let us consider a differentiable\nmanifold, M, and two structures defined on M, namely affine connection,\n\u2207 , and Riemann tensor, K , related by the equation [2],[3]\nK(X, Y )Z = \u2207X \u2207Y Z \u2212 \u2207Y \u2207X Z \u2212 \u2207[X,Y ] Z,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere X, Y and Z are vector fields in the tangent space. The torsion tensor\ncan be defined by\nT (X, Y ) = \u2207X Y \u2212 \u2207Y X \u2212 [X, Y ],\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere \u2207X Y is the covariant derivative of the field Y along the X direction.\nWe define the Lie derivative by\n2\n\n\fLX Y = [X, Y ].\n\n(2.3)\n\nFor a torsion-free connection we can write\nLX Y = \u2207X Y \u2212 \u2207Y X.\n\n(2.4)\n\nLet us consider the tangent field V, the Jacobi field Z and the condition\nLV Z = 0.\n\n(2.5)\n\nFrom (2.5), we can easily see that the equations which govern the Jacobi field\ncan be written in the form\n\u2207V \u2207V Z + K(Z, V )V \u2212 \u2207Z \u2207V V = 0.\n\n(2.6)\n\nIn this section and in sections 3 and 5 we assume the simplest condition\n\u2207V V = 0.\n\n(2.7)\n\nIn this case the Jacobi equations are reduced to a geodesic deviation, assumFZ\ncoincides with the usual\ning a simpler form, and the Fermi derivative D\u2202s\ncovariant derivative\nDZ\nDF Z\n=\n= \u2207V Z,\n\u2202s\n\u2202s\nand\n\u2207V \u2207V Z + K(Z, V )V = 0.\n\n3\n\n(2.8)\n\nJacobi Equation in a Vielbein Basis\n\nWe intend to make use of a vielbein basis related to a local metric G,\nas usual. The metric tensor G\u039b\u03a0 has signature (\u2212, +, . . . , +), with curved\nindices \u039b, \u03a0 \u2208 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, . . . , n) and it is associated to a local coordinate\nbasis. Let us consider the connection between the vielbein and the local\nmetric tensor\n(A) (B)\nG\u039b\u03a0 = E\u039b E\u03a0 \u03b7(A)(B) ,\n(3.1)\n3\n\n\f(A)\n\nwhere \u03b7(A)(B) and E\u039b are Lorentzian metric and vielbein components respectively. The flat indices (A), (B), . . . , (M), (N) \u2208 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, . . . , n).\nIn the vielbein basis we use the following Riemannian curvature\nK(A)(B)(C)(D) = \u2212\u03b3(A)(B)(C),(D) + \u03b3(A)(B)(D),(C)\n\n(3.2)\n\n+\u03b7 (M)(N) [\u03b3(B)(A)(M) (\u03b3(C)(N)(D) \u2212 \u03b3(D)(N)(C) )\n+\u03b3(M)(A)(C) \u03b3(B)(N)(D) \u2212 \u03b3(M)(A)(D) \u03b3(B)(N)(C) ],\nwhere the \u03b3(A)(B)(C)(D) are the Ricci rotation coeficients. We now consider\na massive test particle. Since the particle has a non-vanishing rest mass,\nit is convenient to define the tangent vector V as a timelike one, so that\nG(V, V ) = \u22121. Let us build a Fermi-Walker transport. In the Fermi-Walker\ntransported particle frame the equation (2.8) is given by\nd 2 ZA\n+ K0A0C ZC = 0,\nd\u03c4 2\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhere \u03c4 is, in general, an affine parameter, which in our case is the proper\ntime of the particle and ZA are the vielbein components of the space-like\nvector Z, with G(Z, V ) = 0, and A \u2208 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, . . . , n).\n\n4\n\nModified Hamiltonian Formalism\n\nWe begin this section with the following first order non-linear differential\nequation\ndy\n= y 2,\n(4.1)\nd\u03c4\ndy\n= y02, and solution\nwith the initial conditions in t = 0, y = y0 , d\u03c4\n\ny=\n\ny0\n.\n1 \u2212 y0 t\n\n(4.2)\n\nWe present the first order linear differential equation\ndy\n+ p(t)y = g(t),\nd\u03c4\n4\n\n(4.3)\n\n\fand impose that (4.2) is also solution for (4.3). In this case we have\ny0\ny0\n)2 +\np(t) = g(t).\n(\n1 \u2212 y0 t\n1 \u2212 y0 t\n\n(4.4)\n\nThere is a great set of functions p(t) and g(t) that satisfy (4.4). Unfortunately it is necessary to first solve (4.1), and sometimes a first order\nnon-linear differential equation has an implicit solution. Considering we have\na first or second order non-linear differential system, is it possible to build\na solution method that transfers the non-linearity of the non-linear system\nto the coefficients of a linear system? The answer is positive when Hamilton equations can be put in a special form. In this section we will build\nthis method and in the other ones we will make some applications. For\nthis we will use the modified Hamiltonian formalism, which is reduced to\nthe Hamiltonian formalism when the transformations are canonical or sympletic. It is well-known that in the Hamiltonian formalism the Hamilton\nequations and the Poisson brackets will be conserved only by a canonical or\nsympletic transformation. In [4] we have changed the non-relativistic timedependent harmonic oscillator [6],[7] to a general relativistic approach. In the\nmodified-Hamiltonian formalism only Hamilton equations will be conserved,\nin the sense that they will be transformed into other Hamilton equations\nby a non-canonical or non-sympletic transformation, and the Poisson brackets will not be invariant. We now build a modified Hamiltonian formalism.\nConsider a time-dependent Hamiltonian H(\u03c4 ) where \u03c4 is an affine parameter, in this case, the proper-time of the particle. Let us define 2n variables\nthat will be called \u03be j with index j running from 1 to 2n so that we have\n\u03be j \u2208 (\u03be 1, . . . , \u03be n , \u03be n+1 , . . . , \u03be 2n ) =(q 1 , . . . , q n , p1 , . . . , pn ) where q j and pj are\ncoordinates and momenta, respectively. We now define the Hamiltonian by\n1\nH(\u03c4 ) = Hij \u03be i \u03be j ,\n(4.5)\n2\nwhere Hij is a symmetric matrix. We impose that the Hamiltonian obeys\nthe Hamilton equation\nd\u03be i\n\u2202H\n= J ik k .\n(4.6)\nd\u03c4\n\u2202\u03be\nThe equation (4.6) introduces the sympletic J, given by\nO I\n\u2212I O\n5\n\n!\n\n(4.7)\n\n\fwhere O and I are the nxn zero and identity matrices, respectively. We now\nmake a linear transformation from \u03be j to \u03b7 j given by\n\u03b7j = T j k \u03be k ,\n\n(4.8)\n\nwhere T j k is a non-sympletic matrix, and the new Hamiltonian is given by\n1\nQ = Cij \u03b7 i \u03b7 j ,\n2\n\n(4.9)\n\nwhere Cij is a symmetric matrix. The matrices H, C, and T obey the following\nsystem\ndt\ndT i j\n+ T i k J kl Xlj = J im Yml T j k ,\n(4.10)\nd\u03c4\nd\u03c4\n\u2202H\n\n\u2202Cil i\nwhere 2Xlj = \u2202\u03beijl \u03be i + 2Hlj and 2Yml = \u2202\u03b7\nm \u03b7 + 2Cml , t and \u03c4 are the propertimes of the particle in two different manifolds. We note that (4.10) is a\nfirst order linear differential equation system in T i k , and it is the response\nfor what we looked for because the non-linearity in the Hamilton equations\ndt\nwere transferred to their coefficients. Consider d\u03c4\nXlj = Zlj and write (4.10)\nin the matrix form\ndT\n+ T JZ = JY T,\n(4.11)\nd\u03c4\nwhere T, Z and Y are 2nx2n matrices as\n\nT1 T2\nT3 T4\n\n!\n\n(4.12)\n\nwith similar expressions for Z and Y. Let us write (4.11) as follows\n\nNow consider\n\nT \u03071 = Y3 T1 + Y4 T3 + T2 Z1 \u2212 T1 Z3 ,\n\n(4.13)\n\nT \u03072 = Y3 T2 + Y4 T4 + T2 Z2 \u2212 T1 Z4 ,\nT \u03073 = \u2212Y1 T1 \u2212 Y2 T3 + T4 Z1 \u2212 T3 Z3 ,\n\n(4.14)\n\nT \u03074 = \u2212Y1 T2 \u2212 Y2 T4 + T4 Z2 \u2212 T3 Z4 .\n\n(4.16)\n\nS \u03071 = Y3 S1 + Y4 S3 ,\nS \u03072 = Y3 S2 + Y4 S4 ,\n\n(4.17)\n\n6\n\n(4.15)\n\n(4.18)\n\n\fS \u03073 = \u2212Y1 S1 \u2212 Y2 S3 ,\nS \u03074 = \u2212Y1 S2 \u2212 Y2 S4 ,\n\n(4.19)\n\n\u1e581 = R2 Z1 \u2212 R1 Z3 ,\n\n(4.21)\n\n\u1e582 = R2 Z2 \u2212 R1 Z4 ,\n\n(4.22)\n\n\u1e583 = R4 Z1 \u2212 R3 Z3 ,\n\n(4.23)\n\n\u1e584 = R4 Z2 \u2212 R3 Z4 .\n\n(4.24)\n\n(4.20)\n\nand\n\nFrom the theory of first order differential equation systems [8], it is wellknown that the system (4.17)-(4.24) has a solution in the region where Zlj\nand Yml are continuous functions. In this case, the solution for (4.10) or\n(4.11) is given by\nT1 = (S1 a + S2 b)R1 + (S1 d + S2 c)R3 ,\n\n(4.25)\n\nT2 = (S1 a + S2 b)R2 + (S1 d + S2 c)R4 ,\n\n(4.26)\n\nT3 = (S3 a + S4 b)R1 + (S3 d + S4 c)R3 ,\n\n(4.27)\n\nT4 = (S3 a + S4 b)R2 + (S3 d + S4 c)R4 ,\n\n(4.28)\n\nwhere a,b,c and d are constant nxn matrices, and substituting (4.25)-(4.28)\nin (4.8) we will be completed the mapping among manifolds. In many situdt\nations where it is not possible or easy to put d\u03c4\n, Xlj , Ylj as explicit functions\nof one of the two parameters, t or \u03c4, we should expand them in series of\n\u03c4 , for example,[8] so that with the modified Hamiltonian formalism we can\nmap one differential equation system into another. In this paper we are interested in mapping among manifolds by the use of Hamiltonians for Jacobi\nfields and also for metric tensors. Therefore, if we associate Hij and Clk with\ntwo vielbein curvatures K0A0C and R0A0C respectively, or Hij and Clk with\nthe metric tensors Gij and \u03a9ij , also from two different manifolds, we will\nhave built a local map among manifolds. It is important to note that the\nsame particle has different proper-times in different manifolds, so that line\nelements are not preserved by local non-sympletic maps among manifolds,\nin opposition to general relativity where line elements are preserved by lodt\ncal coordinate transformations. The derivative d\u03c4\nincreases the difficulty in\ndt\n(4.10), so that we assume the condition d\u03c4 = 1. It implies in a decrease on\n7\n\n\fmapped regions. The local non-sympletic maps are well defined for equal\nproper-times and time intervals. In this paper, for the same particle in different manifolds with different proper-times, we only use the proper-time of\none of the manifolds, so that (4.10) assume the following form\ndT i j\n+ T i k J kl Xlj = J im Yml T j k .\nd\u03c4\n\n(4.29)\n\nAs consequence (4.21)-(2.24) will be simplified. We end this section calling\nto mind that in the Hamiltonian formalism the Poisson bracket will be an\ninvariant only by a canonical or sympletic transformation so that in this\ncase (4.8) will be canonical or sympletic and it can be non-linear. In the\nmodified Hamiltonian formalism only Hamilton equations will be conserved\nin the sense that they will be transformed into other Hamilton equations by a\nnon-canonical or non-sympletic transformation (4.8), where (4.10) or (4.29)\nalso will be obeyed, and the Poisson brackets will not be invariant.\n\n5\n\nModified Formalism and Jacobi Fields\n\nIn this section we assume the condition\n\u2207V V = 0,\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhere G(V, V ) = \u22121. We now identify the hamilton matrices with Jacobi\nfields as follow. Let us consider\n1\n1\n(5.2)\nH(\u03c4 ) = Hij \u03be i \u03be j = (\u03c0 t M t \u03b6 + \u03b6 tM\u03c0),\n2\n2\nwhere \u03be j \u2208 (\u03be 1 , . . . , \u03be n , \u03be n+1, . . . , \u03be 2n ) =(\u03b6 1, . . . , \u03b6 n , \u03c0 1 , . . . , \u03c0 n ) and ZA = \u03b6 j\nand \u03c0 j are coordinates and momenta, respectively, and Hij is a real and\nsymmetric matrix given by\n!\nO M\n(5.3)\nMt O\nwhere O is the nxn zero matrix, M t is the nxn transposed matrix of M\nwith MAC = VC;A , and A,C \u2208 (1, . . . , n). Using the Hamiltonian (5.2) in the\nHamilton equation, where ZA =\u03b6 j , we obtain (3.3). Let us consider\n1\nQ = Cij \u03b7 i \u03b7 j ,\n2\n8\n\n(5.4)\n\n\fwhere\n\n1\n(5.5)\nClk = ,\n2\nfor l,k \u2208 (n + 1, . . . , 2n). We use a vielbein basis related to a local metric G,\nas usual. The metric tensor G\u039b\u03a0 has signature (\u2212, +, +, \u2212, \u2212, . . . , \u2212, +, \u2212),\nwith curved indices \u039b, \u03a0 \u2208 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, . . . , n) and it is associated to a\nlocal coordinate basis. Let us consider the connection between the vielbein\nand the local metric tensor\n(A)\n\n(B)\n\nG\u039b\u03a0 = E\u039b E\u03a0 \u03b7(A)(B) ,\n\n(5.6)\n\n(A)\n\nwhere \u03b7(A)(B) = bl \u03b4lk , and E\u039b are a pseudo-euclidian metric and vielbein\ncomponents respectively, and flat indices (A), (B), l, k, . . . , \u2208 (0, 1, 2, 3, . . . , n).\nThe curvature components in the Fermi-Walker transported particle frame\nare given by\n1\nClk = Kl \u03b4lk ,\n(5.7)\n2\nfor l,k\u2208 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, . . . , n), where each Kl is a real constant, positive or\nnegative, \u03b4lk is the Kronecker's delta function. Using now the Hamiltonian\n(5.4) in the Hamilton equation, we obtain the following system\nd2 xi\n+ Ki \u03b4ij xj = 0,\nd\u03c4 2\n\n(5.8)\n\nwhere xi = \u03b7i are the Jacobi fields in the manifold given by (5.5) and (5.7). It\nis a n-dimensional maximally symmetric space or a pseudo-sphere if Kl = K,\nwhere K is a positive constant. For a more general case, where each Kl\nis a real constant, positive or negative, we have built a local map between\none general Riemaniann manifold and another one that is compact in some\ndirections and non-compact in other directions. For Kl as a real and positive\nconstant, the system (5.8) also appears in the analysis of the Jacobi fields on\na n-sphere [9], or geodesic motion on a n-dimensional maximally symmetric\nspace-time [10], both embedded in a (n+1)-dimensional Euclidian manifold.\nIn this case the curvature has the following expression\n\u039b\n\u03a0\n\u03a9\n\u0398\nK(A)(B)(C)(D) = K\u039b\u03a0\u03a9\u0398 E(A)\nE(B)\nE(C)\nE(D)\n,\n\n(5.9)\n\nwhere\nK\u039b\u03a0\u03a9\u0398 = K(G\u039b\u0398 G\u03a0\u03a9 \u2212 G\u039b\u03a9 G\u03a0\u0398 ),\n9\n\n(5.10)\n\n\fand in the Fermi-Walker transported particle frame (5.9) assume the simple\nform\nK0A0C = K\u03b4AC .\n(5.11)\nWe note that (5.11) is a special case of (5.7). Sometimes, as in [4], is convenient to assume the following Hamiltonian matrix elements\nHij = K0A0C ,\n\n(5.12)\n\nwhere K0A0C is the Riemannian curvature in a Fermi-Walker transported\nparticle frame, and i,j,A,B \u2208 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, . . . , n). For i,j \u2208 (n + 1, . . . , 2n)\nwe have\n1\nHij = .\n(5.13)\n2\nExplicitly,\n1\n1\nH(\u03c4 ) = Hij \u03be i \u03be j = (PA P A + Z A K0A0C Z C ).\n(5.14)\n2\n2\nSubstituting (5.14) into Hamilton equation we will obtain (3.3). Hamiltonians of type (5.14) are not appropriate for Jacobi fields on a non-geodesic\ncurve.\n\n6\n\nJacobi Fields on a Non-Geodesic Curve\n\nIn this section we assume the condition\n\u2207V V 6= 0,\n\n(6.1)\n\nwhere G(V, V ) = \u22121. In this case the Jacobi equation is not reduced to a\nFZ\ndoes not coincide with the\ngeodesic deviation, and the Fermi derivative D\u2202s\nusual covariant derivative\nDF Z\nDZ\n6=\n= \u2207V Z.\n\u2202s\n\u2202s\nWe intend to make use of a vielbein basis related to a local metric G, as in\nsection 3. The metric tensor G\u039b\u03a0 has signature (\u2212, +, . . . , +), with curved\nindices \u039b, \u03a0 \u2208 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, . . . , n) and it is associated to a local coordinate\nbasis. Let us consider the connection between the vielbein and the local\nmetric tensor\n(A) (B)\nG\u039b\u03a0 = E\u039b E\u03a0 \u03b7(A)(B) .\n(6.2)\n10\n\n\fConsidering a Fermi-Walker transported particle frame and also the associated Hamiltonian given by the following function\n1\n1\nH(\u03c4 ) = Hij \u03be i \u03be j = (\u03c0 t M t \u03b6 + \u03b6 tM\u03c0),\n2\n2\n\n(6.3)\n\nwhere \u03be j \u2208 (\u03be 1 , . . . , \u03be n , \u03be n+1, . . . , \u03be 2n ) =(\u03b6 1, . . . , \u03b6 n , \u03c0 1 , . . . , \u03c0 n ) and ZA = \u03b6 j\nand \u03c0 j are coordinates and momenta, respectively, and Hij is a real and\nsymmetric matrix given by\n!\nO M\n(6.4)\nMt O\nwhere O is the nxn zero matrix, M t is the nxn transposed matrix of M with\nMAC = VC;A , and A,C \u2208 (1, . . . , n). Using the Hamilton equation we have\n\nand\n\nd\u03b6 A\n\u2202H\n=\n= VA;C \u03b6 C ,\nd\u03c4\n\u2202\u03c0 A\n\n(6.5)\n\n\u2202H\nd\u03c0 C\n= \u2212 C.\nd\u03c4\n\u2202\u03b6\n\n(6.6)\n\nBy the derivative of (6.5) we obtain the following result [2]\nd2 \u03b6A\n+ (R0A0C \u2212 V\u0307A;C \u2212 V\u0307A V\u0307 C )\u03b6C = 0,\n2\nd\u03c4\n\n(6.7)\n\nwhere (6.7) is the Jacobi equation on a non-geodesic curve and V\u0307A = VA;C V C .\nLet us consider a Fermi-Walker transported particle frame in a new manifold.\nThe associated Hamiltonian is given by the following function\n1\n1\nQ(\u03c4 ) = Cij \u03b7 i \u03b7 j = (\u03a0t N t \u03c7 + \u03c7t N\u03a0)\n2\n2\n\n(6.8)\n\nwhere g(U, U) = \u22121, \u03b7 j \u2208 (\u03b7 1 , . . . , \u03b7 n , \u03b7 n+1, . . . , \u03b7 2n ) =(\u03c71 , . . . , \u03c7n , \u03a01 , . . . , \u03a0n )\nand \u03c7j and \u03a0j are coordinates and momenta, respectively, and Cij is a real\nand symmetric matrix given by\nO N\nNt O\n\n11\n\n!\n\n(6.9)\n\n\fwhere O is the nxn zero matrix, N t is the transpose of the nxn matrix N\nwith NAC = UC;A , and A,C \u2208 (1, . . . , n). Using The Hamilton equation we\nhave the following results\n\nand\n\nd\u03c7A\n\u2202Q\n=\n= UA;C \u03c7C ,\nA\nd\u03c4\n\u2202\u03a0\n\n(6.10)\n\n\u2202Q\nd\u03a0C\n= \u2212 C.\nd\u03c4\n\u2202\u03c7\n\n(6.11)\n\nBy the derivative of (6.10) we obtain\nd2 \u03c7A\n+ (R0A0C \u2212 U\u0307A;C \u2212 U\u0307A U\u0307 C )\u03c7C = 0,\nd\u03c4 2\n\n(6.12)\n\nwhere (6.12) is the Jacobi equation on a non-geodesic curve in the new manifold. Now we can build a map between the old and the new manifolds by\nthe non-sympletic linear transformation (4.8). From the theory of first order\ndifferential equation systems [8], it is well-known that the system (4.10) or\n(4.29) has a solution in the region where the elements of the matrices Xlj\nand Yml are continuous functions. In other words, we have mapped (6.7) on\n(6.12).\n\n7\n\nModified Formalism and Metric Tensor\n\nIn this section we identify the Hamilton matrices with the metric tensors of\ntwo different manifolds. Let us assume that\nHij = Gij ,\n\n(7.1)\n\nwhere Gij is a local metric tensor, and for the new Hamiltonian we assume\nthe simple case given by\n1\nClk = b(\u03c4 )l \u03b4lk ,\n(7.2)\n2\nwhere \u03c4 is an affine parameter, and Clk is a metric tensor with i,j,l,k \u2208\n(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, . . . , n). For i,j,l,k \u2208 (n + 1, . . . , 2n) we have\n1\nHij = ,\n2\n12\n\n(7.3)\n\n\fand\nExplicitly,\n\n1\nClk = .\n2\n\n(7.4)\n\n1\n1\nH(\u03c4 ) = Hij \u03be i \u03be j = (Pi P i + X i Gij X j ),\n2\n2\n\n(7.5)\n\nand\n\n1\n1\nQ(\u03c4 ) = Cij \u03b7 i \u03b7 j = (pi pi + xl b(\u03c4 )l \u03b4lk xk ),\n(7.6)\n2\n2\nwhere Hij = Hji = Gij = Gji , and Clk = Ckl = 12 b(\u03c4 )l \u03b4lk . As each bl can\nbe a positive or negative function for the same time interval, we have built a\nlocal map between one general (torsion-free connection or not) manifold and\nanother one that is compact in some directions and non-compact in other\ndirections. If b(\u03c4 )l are time-independent (b(\u03c4 )l = bl ), then, in this case, the\nmap is equivalent to (3.1). In other words, it is possible to obtain, with\nthis map, the same results obtained with vielbein. However, vielbein is also\nvery useful for Fermi transport which is defined in a torsion-free connection\nmanifold only. It is possible we chose, as Hamiltonian metric functions, the\nusual symmetric forms as follow\n1\n1\nH(\u03c4 ) = Hij \u03be i \u03be j = X i Gij X j ,\n2\n2\n\n(7.7)\n\nand\n\n1\n1\n(7.8)\nQ(\u03c4 ) = Cij \u03b7 i \u03b7 j = xl glk xk .\n2\n2\nWe could have substituted (7.5) and (7.6) by (7.7) and (7.8), with glk =\nb(\u03c4 )l \u03b4lk . We note that functions (7.7) and (7.8) are not conventional Hamiltonians, but their associated system (4.17)-(4.24) will be simpler than the\ncorrespondent to (7.5) and (7.6). Now we consider an interesting Hamiltonian function presented in the last section\n1\n1\nH(\u03c4 ) = Hij \u03be i \u03be j = (pt M t x + xt Mp),\n2\n2\n\n(7.9)\n\nwhere \u03be j \u2208 ((\u03be 1, . . . , \u03be n , \u03be n+1 , . . . , \u03be 2n ) = (x1 , . . . , xn , p1 , . . . , xn )) and xj and\npj are coordinates and momenta, respectively, and Hij is a symmetric matrix\ngiven by\n!\nO M\n(7.10)\nMt O\n13\n\n\fwhere O is the nxn zero matrix, M t is the nxn transposed matrix of M with\nMij = Gji , and i,j \u2208 (1, . . . , n). Now we write another Hamilton\n1\n1\nQ(\u03c4 ) = Cij \u03b7 i \u03b7 j = (P t N t X + X t NP )\n2\n2\n\n(7.11)\n\nwhere \u03b7 j \u2208 (\u03b7 1 , . . . , \u03b7 n , \u03b7 n+1 , . . . , \u03b7 2n ) =(X 1 , . . . , X n , P 1, . . . , P n ) and X j and\nP j are coordinates and momenta, respectively, and Cij is a real and symmetric matrix given by\n!\nO N\n(7.12)\nNt O\nwhere O is the nxn zero matrix, N t is the transpose of the nxn matrix N\nwith Nlk = gkl , and l,k \u2208 (1, . . . , n). It is important to note that in this case\nGij and glk may not have defined symmetries, and using (4.8) and (4.10) or\n(4.29) we transform the Hamilton equation for (of) Gij into that for (of) glk .\nThe last map is very important because it connects different areas both in\nmathematics and physics.\n\n8\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nIt is known that the system (5.8) of n-dimensional harmonic oscillators (for\npositive Kl ) is the Jacobi equation on a maximally symmetric spacetime [9],\nas well as it is the geodesic equation on a spacetime with constant curvature\n[10]. For different sets of signs in bl , the system composed by (7.2) and (7.4)\nhas as solutions different sets of pseudo-euclidian spaces, where each one of\nthem has form-invariant metric by a subgroup of GL(n,R). In Sections 5 and\n6 we have presented two ways of building a map among manifolds by the\nuse of the equations (4.6), (4.8)and (4.10). Physics of wormholes is a very\nimportant research area [11], [12], [13], [14]. Maps among manifolds can be\nthought as wormholes, and can be considered as a different approach for\nthis. It is also possible to build a traversable wormhole by a map between\ntwo different regions in the same manifold. Solutions of (4.7) can be very\ndifficult, but in cases where they are possible, maps among manifolds will be a\npowerful option to conformal maps, Fermi transport, and vielbein formalism.\nTraditionally, expressions like Hamilton equations are associated with some\nkind of invariance property, as in the specialized literature. Invariance is a\nfundamental property in many theories, as in general relativity. However, if\n14\n\n\fwe want to build maps among manifolds, the modified Hamiltonian formalism\ncan be useful.\n\nReferences\n[1] J. Cheeger and D. G.
