Hofstad\u2217\n\nGordon Slade\u2020\n\nDecember 22, 2003\n\nAbstract\nWe use the lace expansion to prove that the critical values for nearest-neighbour bond\npercolation on the n-cube {0, 1}n and on Zn have asymptotic expansions, with rational coefficients, to all orders in powers of n\u22121 .\n\n1\n\nMain result\n\nWe consider bond percolation on Zn with edge set consisting of pairs {x, y} of vertices in Zn with\nP\nkx \u2212 yk1 = 1, where kwk1 = nj=1 |wj | for w \u2208 Zn . Bonds (edges) are independently occupied with\nprobability p and vacant with probability 1 \u2212 p. We also consider bond percolation on the n-cube\nQn , which has vertex set {0, 1}n and edge set consisting of pairs {x, y} of vertices in {0, 1}n with\nkx \u2212 yk1 = 1, where we regard Qn as an additive group with addition component-wise modulo 2.\nAgain bonds are independently occupied with probability p and vacant with probability 1 \u2212 p. We\nwrite G in place of Qn and Zn when we wish to refer to both models simultaneously. We write \u03a9\nfor the degree of G, so that \u03a9 = 2n for Zn and \u03a9 = n for Qn .\nFor the case of Zn , the critical value is defined by\npc (Zn ) = inf{p : \u2203 an infinite connected cluster of occupied bonds a.s.}.\n\n(1.1)\n\nGiven a vertex x of G, let C(x) denote the connected cluster of x, i.e., the set of vertices y such\nthat y is connected to x by a path consisting of occupied bonds. Let |C(x)| denote the cardinality\nof C(x), and let \u03c7(p) = Ep |C(0)| denote the expected cluster size of the origin. Results of [1, 20]\nimply that\npc (Zn ) = sup{p : \u03c7(p) < \u221e}.\n(1.2)\nis an equivalent definition of the critical value.\nFor percolation on a finite graph G, such as Qn , the above characterizations of pc (G) are\ninapplicable.

As discussed in [10], pc (Qn ; \u03bb0 ) depends only weakly on the choice of \u03bb0 .\nThis point is also reflected in the Remark below.\nOur main result is the following theorem.\nTheorem 1.1. (i) For G = Zn , there are rational numbers ai (Zn ) such that for all M \u2265 1,\nM\nX\n\npc (Zn ) =\n\nai (Zn )(2n)\u2212i + O((2n)\u2212M \u22121 )\n\nas n \u2192 \u221e.\n\n(1.4)\n\ni=1\n\nThe constant in the error term depends on M.\n(ii) For Qn , let M \u2265 1, fix constants c, c\u2032 (independent of n but possibly depending on M), and\nchoose p such that \u03c7(p) \u2208 [cnM , c\u2032 n\u22122M 2n ]. Then there are rational numbers ai (Qn ), independent\nof p, c, c\u2032, such that for all M \u2265 1,\np=\n\nM\nX\n\nai (Qn )n\u2212i + O(n\u2212M \u22121)\n\nas n \u2192 \u221e.\n\n(1.5)\n\ni=1\n\nThe constant in the error term depends on M, c, c\u2032 , but does not depend otherwise on p.\nRemark. Theorem 1.1(ii) states that, for Qn , any p for which \u03c7(p) \u2208 [cnM , c\u2032 n\u22122M 2n ] will have\nthe same expansion up to an error O(n\u2212M \u22121), with the error independent of p. Note that the\nexpansion (1.5) is valid simultaneously to all orders M if we choose p to lie eventually in all\nintervals [cnM , c\u2032 n\u22122M 2n ]. Thus, (1.5) holds simultaneously for all M for any p for which \u03c7(p)\nis in the interval [fn , fn\u22121 2n ], where fn is \u221aa sequence that grows faster than any power and more\nslowly than e\u03b1n for all \u03b1 > 0 (e.g., fn = 2 n ). In particular, (1.5) holds for p = pc (Qn ; \u03bb0 ) for any\nconstant \u03bb0 > 0, with the ai (Qn ) independent of \u03bb0 .\nThe formulas (1.4)\u2013(1.5) for M = 3 were obtained in [18], with a1 (Qn ) = a1 (Zn ) = 1, a2 (Qn ) =\na2 (Zn ) = 1, a3 (Qn ) = a3 (Zn ) = 27 , and it was predicted (but not proved) that a4 (Qn ) and a4 (Zn )\nare different. Equation (1.4) with M = 3 was proved previously in [16, 17], where it was shown\nthat pc (Zn ) = (2n)\u22121 + (2n)\u22122 + 27 (2n)\u22123 + O((2n)\u22124).\nThe expansion\npc (Zn ) =\n\n1\n1\n7\n16\n103\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+***\n2n (2n)2 2(2n)3 (2n)4 (2n)5\n\n(1.6)\n\nwas reported in [12], but with no rigorous bound on the remainder. The convergence of pc (Zn ) to\nthe leading term (2n)\u22121 has been studied in [4, 6, 14, 15, 19], with various error estimates.\nFor Qn , the leading term for the critical value was identified as n\u22121 in [3], and this was refined\nin [7]. It was subsequently proved (see [10, (1.10)]) that\n\u2212n/3\n1 \u2212 \u03bb\u22121\n\u2264 npc (Qn ) \u2264 1 + O(n\u22121 ).\n0 2\n\nThis gives (1.5) for M = 1 for p = pc (Qn ).\n2\n\n(1.7)\n\n\fIn [8, 9, 10], it was conjectured that the phase transition for Qn takes place within a scaling\nwindow of width 2\u2212n/3 centred at pc (Qn ), and it was proved that the scaling window has width at\n1/3\nmost e\u2212cn . Except in the unlikely circumstance that the expansion (1.5) eventually terminates\nas a polynomial in n\u22121 , any truncation of the expansion gives a result that lies outside this\nexponentially small scaling window for large enough n. The non-perturbative definition (1.3) of\npc (Qn ) therefore tracks the scaling window more accurately than any polynomial in n\u22121 can ever\ndo.\nOn the other hand, the asymptotic expansion gives information on the phase transition on\nQn , at every polynomial scale. To explain this, we first recall some results from [10]. Let p =\npc (Qn ) + \u01ebn\u22121 , where \u01eb may depend on n, and let Cmax denote a cluster of maximal size. By [10,\nTheorem 1.1], if \u01eb < 0 and limn\u2192\u221e |\u01eb|2n/3 = \u221e, then\n\u03c7(p) =\n\n1\n[1 + o(1)],\n|\u01eb|\n\nc1\n2(log 2)n\n\u2264 |Cmax | \u2264\n[1 + o(1)]\n2\n\u01eb\n\u01eb2\n\n(1.8)\n\na.a.s.,\n\n(1.9)\n\nwhere c1 is a universal constant, and where we say that a sequence En of events holds a.a.s.\n(asymptotically almost surely) if limn\u2192\u221e P(En ) = 1. By [10, Theorems 1.4, 1.5], there are universal\nconstants c2 , c3 , c4 such that if \u01eb > 0 and limn\u2192\u221e \u01eb2n/3 = \u221e, then\nc2 \u01eb2 2n \u2264 \u03c7(p) \u2264 c3 \u01eb2 2n ,\n\n(1.10)\n\n|Cmax | \u2265 c4 \u01eb2n\n\n(1.11)\n\na.a.s.\n\nFor M \u2265 1, let\n)\np(M\nc (Qn ) =\n\nM\nX\n\nai (Qn )n\u2212i\n\n(1.12)\n\ni=1\n\ndenote an approximate critical value. Let p = pc(M ) (Qn ) + \u03b4n\u2212M , so that by (1.5) p = pc (Qn ) + \u01ebn\u22121\nwith \u01eb = \u03b4n1\u2212M [1 + O(\u03b4 \u22121 n\u22121 )]. It follows from (1.8)\u2013(1.9) that for fixed \u03b4 < 0, as n \u2192 \u221e, we\nhave\n\u03c7(p) = |\u03b4|\u22121 nM \u22121 [1 + o(1)],\n1 \u22122 2M \u22122\nc1 \u03b4 n\n\u2264 |Cmax | \u2264 2(log 2)\u03b4 \u22122 n2M \u22121 [1 + o(1)]\n2\n\n(1.13)\n\na.a.s.\n\n(1.14)\n\nIn addition, it follows from (1.10)\u2013(1.11) that for fixed \u03b4 > 0,\n1 2 2(1\u2212M ) n\nc2 \u03b4 n\n2 \u2264 \u03c7(p) \u2264 2c3 \u03b4 2 n2(1\u2212M ) 2n ,\n2\n1\n|Cmax | \u2265 c4 \u03b4n1\u2212M 2n\n2\n3\n\na.a.s.\n\n(1.15)\n\n(1.16)\n\n\fThis shows that the largest cluster jumps from poly-logarithmic in the volume for \u03b4 < 0, to\nproportional to the volume up to poly-logarithmic factors for \u03b4 > 0. Thus there is a phase\n)\ntransition on scale n\u2212M at p(M\nc (Qn ), for each M \u2265 1. A similar transition takes place if we\ninstead consider p = pc (Qn ) + \u03b4n\u2212M , where the critical point pc (Qn ) is of course independent of M.\nAlthough pc (Qn ) locates the phase transition simultaneously for perturbations on scale n\u2212M for\nall M, there is nevertheless a satisfying concreteness to the polynomial pc(M ) (Qn ) in n\u22121 , compared\n)\nto the implicitly defined pc (Qn ) of (1.3). Moreover, p(M\nc (Qn ) is independent of the parameter \u03bb0 .\nIn the next proposition, we conclude from (1.13) and (1.15) that Theorem 1.1(ii) follows if we\ncan prove (1.5) for any one particular choice of p, such that \u03c7(p) lies in the interval [cnM , c\u2032 n\u22122M 2n ].\nWe will make a convenient choice in (2.4) below.\nProposition 1.2. Let G = Qn . If p obeys (1.5) for some fixed sequence p (depending on n) such\nthat \u03c7(p) \u2208 [cnM , c\u2032 n\u22122M 2n ], then (1.5) is valid for every such p.\nProof. Define p1 and p2 by \u03c7(p1 ) = cnM and \u03c7(p2 ) = c\u2032 n\u22122M 2n . Then p1 \u2264 p2 . We will prove\nthat p1 \u2265 pc (Qn ) \u2212 O(n\u2212M \u22121 ) and p2 \u2264 pc (Qn ) + O(n\u2212M \u22121), where the constants in the error\nbounds depend only on c, c\u2032 . This suffices, since it implies that if \u03c7(p), \u03c7(p\u2032 ) \u2208 [cnM , c\u2032 n\u22122M 2n ],\nthen |p\u2032 \u2212 p| = O(n\u2212M \u22121).\nTo prove the bound on p1 , we let \u01eb1 = 2c\u22121 n\u2212M .

On a very naive level, the coefficients\n1, 1, 27 , 16, 103 stated in (1.6) are going in the uncomfortable direction. Also, there is an example\nwhere divergence has been proven. In [11], Fisher and Singh review expansions in the inverse\ndimension for the critical temperature of spin systems, and in particular for the N-vector model\n[13]. It has not been proven that such expansions are asymptotic for general N. However, for the\nspherical model [5], which corresponds to the limit N \u2192 \u221e of the N-vector model, the critical\ntemperature Tc (Zn ) is exactly equal to\n\nP\n\nn\n\nTc (Z ) =\n\n\"Z\n\n[\u2212\u03c0,\u03c0]n\n\n1\n\ndk1\ndkn\n***\nPn\n2(n \u2212 j=1 cos kj ) 2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n4\n\n#\u22121\n\n.\n\n(1.21)\n\n\fThe integral (1.21) has an asymptotic expansion to all orders in powers of 1/n, but this expansion\nis divergent [13]. There is no reason to expect that such divergence is limited to the spherical\nmodel.\nAs a side remark, we note that it is pointed out in [13] that there are sign changes in the\nexpansion of Tc (Zn ) at orders (2n)\u221212 and (2n)\u221220 . From (1.6), one might guess that ai (Zn ) \u2265 0\nfor all i, but the spherical model shows that negative coefficients can occur relatively late in the\nseries. Indeed, although we do not determine their overall signs except for i = 1, 2, 3, in our proof\nthere are contributions to the ai (G) of both signs.\nFor the connective constant for self-avoiding walks on Zn , existence of an asymptotic expansion\nto all orders in (2n)\u22121 was proved in [16], but the corresponding result for percolation was not\nobtained. Our method is based on the lace expansion and follows the same general approach as\nthat used for the connective constant in [16], but the details here are significantly different and\nsubstantially more difficult.\n\n2\n\nApplication of the lace expansion\n\nFor Qn or Zn with n large, the lace expansion [15] gives rise to an identity\n\u03c7(p) =\n\n1 + \u03a0\u0302p\n,\n1 \u2212 \u03a9p[1 + \u03a0\u0302p ]\n\n(2.1)\n\nvalid for p \u2264 pc (G). The function \u03a0\u0302p is finite for this range of p. Although we do not display the\ndependence explicitly in the notation, \u03a0\u0302p does depend on the graph Qn or Zn . For a derivation of\nthe lace expansion, see, e.g., [9, Section 3]. It follows from (2.1) that\n\u03a9p =\n\n1\n\u2212 \u03c7(p)\u22121 .\n1 + \u03a0\u0302p\n\n(2.2)\n\nFor Zn , (2.1) follows from results in [15, Section 4.3.2]. (Note the notational difference that in\nP\nn\nn\n[15] what we are calling here \u03a0\u0302p is equal to \u221e\nn=0 (\u22121) \u011dn (0).) Since \u03c7(pc (Z )) = \u221e, (2.2) gives\n2npc (Zn ) =\n\n1\n.\n1 + \u03a0\u0302pc (Zn )\n\n(2.3)\n\nBounds of [15] imply that |\u03a0\u0302pc (Zn ) | = O(n\u22121 ). This gives pc (Zn ) = (2n)\u22121 + O(n\u22122 ), which is (1.4)\nfor M = 1.\nFor Qn , the identity (2.1) is established in [9, (6.1)]. We fix a sequence fn as in the remark\nbelow Theorem 1.1. That is, we require that limn\u2192\u221e fn n\u2212M = \u221e for every positive integer M and\nthat limn\u2192\u221e fn e\u2212\u03b1n = 0 for every \u03b1 > 0. In view of Proposition 1.2, it suffices to prove (1.5) for\np = p\u0304, where p\u0304 is defined by\n\u03c7(p\u0304) = fn .\n(2.4)\nFor p = p\u0304, (2.2) gives\nnp\u0304 =\n\n1\n+ O(fn\u22121).\n1 + \u03a0\u0302p\u0304\n5\n\n(2.5)\n\n\fThe second term on the right hand side is an error term for (1.5), and can be neglected in the proof\nof Theorem 1.1(ii). It follows from results in [9] that |\u03a0\u0302p\u0304 | \u2264 O(n\u22121 ). In more detail, it follows from\n[9, Proposition 5.2] that |\u03a0\u0302p | \u2264 const(\u03bb3 \u2228 \u03b2), where \u03bb = \u03c7(p)2\u2212n/3 \u2264 fn 2\u2212n/3 for p \u2264 p\u0304c (Qn ), and\n\u03b2 is proportional to n\u22121 by [9, Proposition 2.1]. With (2.5), this implies that p\u0304 = n\u22121 + O(n\u22122 ),\nwhich is (1.5) for M = 1.\nHenceforth, we will write\np\u0304c = p\u0304c (G) =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2p\u0304\n\n(G = Qn )\n\uf8f3p (Zn ) (G = Zn ).\nc\n\n(2.6)\n\nThe identities (2.3) and (2.5) give recursive equations for p\u0304c , in which an input for p\u0304c on the right\nhand side gives rise to an improved value of p\u0304c on the left hand side. To prove Theorem 1.1 using\nthis recursion, we will apply the following proposition.\nProposition 2.1. Fix M \u2265 1. For G = Qn and G = Zn , there are rational numbers \u03b1j,i,M =\n\u03b1j,i,M (G) and a positive integer LM such that for p \u2264 p\u0304c (G),\n\u03a0\u0302p =\n\nLM X\ni\u22121\nX\n\n\u03b1j,i,M \u03a9j pi + O(\u03a9\u2212M \u22121).\n\n(2.7)\n\ni=1 j=0\n\nThe constant in the error term depends on M.\nProof of Theorem 1.1 assuming Proposition 2.1. We restrict attention to p = p\u0304c , which is sufficient\nby Proposition 1.2. The proof is by induction on M. As discussed above, we know that (1.4) and\n(1.5) hold for M = 1. We assume that (1.4)\u2013(1.5) hold for 1, . . . , M, and prove the corresponding\nresult for M + 1.\nBy (2.3) and (2.5),\n1\n1\np\u0304c =\n+ O(\u03a9\u2212M \u22122 )\n(2.8)\n\u03a9 1 + \u03a0\u0302p\u0304c\n(in fact the error term is zero for Zn and is O(n\u22121 fn\u22121 ) for Qn ).

This completes the proof.\nNote that the precise value of LM is not needed in the above proof. It remains to prove\nProposition 2.1. For this, we will use the description of \u03a0\u0302p given in the next section.\n\nThe function \u03a0\u0302p\n\n3\n\nThe function \u03a0\u0302p has the form\n\u03a0\u0302p =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n)\n(\u22121)N \u03a0\u0302(N\np .\n\n(3.1)\n\nN =0\n)\nTo define \u03a0\u0302(N\n(see [9] or [15]), we need the following definition.\np\n\nDefinition 3.1. (i) Given a bond configuration, we say that x is doubly connected to y, and write\nx \u21d4 y, if x = y or if there are at least two bond-disjoint paths from x to y consisting of occupied\nbonds.\n(ii) Given a bond configuration, vertices x, y, and a set A of vertices of G, we say x and y are\nA\nconnected through A, and write x \u2194 y, if every occupied path connecting x to y has at least one\nbond with an endpoint in A.\n(iii) Given a bond configuration, and a bond b, we define C\u0303 b (x) to be the set of vertices connected\nto x in the new configuration obtained by setting b to be vacant.\n(iv) Given a bond configuration and vertices x, y, we say that the directed bond (u, v) is pivotal\nfor x \u2194 y if (a) x \u2194 y occurs when the bond {u, v} is set occupied, and (b) x \u2194 y does not\noccur when {u, v} is set vacant, but x \u2194 u and v \u2194 y do occur. (Note that there is a distinction\nbetween the events {(u, v) is pivotal for x \u2194 y} and {(u, v) is pivotal for y \u2194 x} = {(v, u) is\npivotal for x \u2194 y}.)\n(v) Given vertices v, x and a set of vertices A, let\nA\n\nA\n\nE \u2032 (v, x; A) = {v \u2194 x} \u2229 {6 \u2203 occupied pivotal (u\u2032 , v \u2032 ) for v \u2194 x s.t. v \u2194 u\u2032 }.\n\n(3.2)\n\nWe refer to the second event on the right hand side of (3.2) as the \"NP\" (no pivotal) condition.\nBy definition,\n\u03a0\u0302(0)\np =\n\nX\n\nPp (0 \u21d4 x)\n\n(3.3)\n\nx6=0\n\nand\n\u03a0\u0302(1)\np =\n\nX X\n\nx (u0 ,v0 )\n\nh\n\ni\n\npE0 I[0 \u21d4 u0 ]E1 I[E \u2032 (v0 , x; C\u03030(u0 ,v0 ) (0))] .\n(u,v)\n\n(3.4)\n\nOn the right hand side of (3.4), the cluster C\u03030 (0) is random with respect to the expectation\n(u,v)\nE0 , but C\u03030 (0) should be regarded as a fixed set inside the probability P1 .

The expectations in (3.5) are mutually dependent through\nthe C\u0303 clusters. We use subscripts for C\u0303 and the expectations, to indicate to which expectation\nC\u0303 belongs, and refer to the bond configuration corresponding to expectation j as the \"level-j\"\nconfiguration. We also write Fj to indicate an event F at level-j.\nWe will rewrite (3.5) as follows. We set uN = x and v\u22121 = 0, and write\nE0 = {0 \u21d4 u0 }0 ,\nEj = E \u2032 (vj\u22121, uj , C\u0303j\u22121)j\n\n(j = 1, . . . , N),\n\n(3.6)\n(3.7)\n\nand\nE (N ) = E0 \u2229 E1 \u2229 * * * \u2229 EN .\n\n(3.8)\n\nWe drop the subscript p on \u03a0\u0302(N) , and write E(N ) for the joint expectation E0 E1 * * * EN .

In addition, it is\nshown in [9, Proposition 2.1] that \u03b2 can be chosen proportional to n\u22121 . This gives (3.10) for\nQn . For Zn , (3.10) follows from results in [15, Section 4.3.2] (we emphasize again that there are\nnotational differences in [15]).\nIt follows immediately from (3.10) that to prove (2.7) it is sufficient to prove that there are\nrational numbers \u03b1j,i,M such that\nM\nX\n\n)\n(\u22121)N \u03a0\u0302(N\np =\n\nLM X\ni\u22121\nX\n\n\u03b1j,i,M \u03a9j pi + O(\u03a9\u2212M \u22121 ).\n\n(3.11)\n\ni=1 j=0\n\nN =0\n\n(N )\nThus it is sufficient to show that for each N \u2264 M there are rational numbers \u03b1j,i,M\nsuch that\n\n)\n\u03a0\u0302(N\np =\n\nLM X\ni\u22121\nX\n\n(N)\n\u03b1j,i,M\n\u03a9j pi + O(\u03a9\u2212M \u22121).\n\ni=1 j=0\n\n8\n\n(3.12)\n\n\fSuppose that we could show instead that\n(N )\n\n\u03a0\u0302p =\n\nLM\nLM X\nX\n\n(N)\n\u03b1j,i,M\n\u03a9j pi + O(\u03a9\u2212M \u22121).\n\n(3.13)\n\ni=0 j=0\n\nThe sum on the right hand side can be rewritten as\nLM\nX\n\nk=\u2212LM\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03a9k \uf8ed\n\nLX\nM \u2212k\n\ni=\u2212k\u22280\n\n\uf8f6\n\n(N)\n\u03b1i+k,i,M\n(\u03a9p)i \uf8f8 .\n\n(3.14)\n\nIt follows from (3.10) that\nLX\nM \u2212k\n\n(N )\n\u03b1i+k,i,M\n(\u03a9p)i = 0\n\n(k > \u2212(N \u2228 1)),\n\n(3.15)\n\ni=0\n\n(N )\nfor a continuous range of p values of order \u03a9\u22121 .

These error terms are bounded in Section 5, to complete the\nproof of (3.13). We begin with some definitions.\n9\n\n\f4.1\n\nBasic concepts\n\nFor N \u2265 0, let G(N ) = (G(0), . . . , G(N)) denote (N + 1) copies of G. This graph contains the edge\nset of G within each component G(i), and no edge links any vertex of G(i) with any vertex of G(j)\nwhen i 6= j. We consider percolation on G(N ) , which is the natural setting for the event E (N ) of\n(3.8). We denote the set of vertices of G(N ) by (V(0), . . . , V(N)), where V(j) is the vertex set of\nG(j). In the event Ej = E \u2032 (vj\u22121 , uj ; C\u0303j\u22121)j , the random set C\u0303j\u22121 \u2282 V(j \u2212 1) is identified with the\ncorresponding subset of V(j), in (3.2).\nDefinition 4.1.

Thus D(y \u2212 x)\nis the transition probability for simple random walk on G to make a step from x to y. Let\n\u03c4p (y \u2212 x) = Pp (x \u2194 y) denote the two-point function, and let \u03c4p(i) (x) denote the probability that\nthere is an occupied (self-avoiding) path from 0 to x of length at least i.\nWe define the Fourier transform of an absolutely summable function f on the vertex set V of\nG by\nX\nf\u02c6(k) =\nf (x)eik*x\n(k \u2208 V\u2217 ),\n(5.1)\nx\u2208V\n\nwhere V\u2217 = {0, \u03c0}n for Qn and V\u2217 = [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0]n for Zn .

We assume some familiarity with diagrammatic estimates, as in [9, Section 4].\nWe begin by rewriting (3.21) as\nF\n\n(N)\n\n=\n\nN\n[ \\\n\nFj ,\n\n(5.9)\n\n~t,w,~\n~ z j=0\n\nwhere we have made the abbreviations F0 = F0 (0, u0, w0 , z0 )0 , Fi = F (vi\u22121 , ti , zi , ui , wi , zi+1 )i , and\nFN = FN (vN \u22121 , tN , zN , x)N . We will use the estimate\nP\n\n(N)\n\n\u0012\n\nG\u2229\n\nN\n[ \\\n\n~t,w,~\n~ z j=0\n\n\u0013\n\nFj \u2264\n\nX\n\n~t,w,~\n~ z\n\nP\n\n(N)\n\n\u0012\n\nG\u2229\n\nN\n\\\n\nj=0\n\n\u0013\n\nFj ,\n\n(5.10)\n\n)\nwith G = {\u2203 occupied \u03c9 \u2208 Pj \\Pj,10(M +1) } (for fixed j, M). The standard bounds on \u03a0\u0302(N\nuse\np\n(5.10) with G equal to the whole probability space. In the standard bounds, after applying the\nBK inequality, each of the disjoint connections in (3.16)\u2013(3.20), say {y1 \u2194 y2 }, gives rise to a\n)\ntwo-point function \u03c4p (y2 \u2212 y1 ). The overall effect is to bound \u03a0\u0302(N\nby a Feynman diagram, which\np\n(i,3)\nis then bounded by products of T\nas in [9, Section 4]. We will modify this standard procedure\nto prove the proposition.\nWe decompose G as G = G1 \u222a G2 , where G1 is the event that one of the disjoint connections\nin (3.16)\u2013(3.20), say {y1 \u2194 y2 }, is replaced by the disjoint occurrence of {y1 \u2194 y2 via a path\nconsisting of at least 2(M + 1) occupied bonds}, and G2 = G\\G1 .\n\n18\n\n\fb\nb\n\n0\n\nx\n\n0\n\na\n\nx\n\na\n\nFigure 1: Examples of disjoint connections satisfying G2 . Each solid path joining a pair of vertices\nhas length at most 2(M + 1), and the first and second dotted paths have lengths at least 2(M + 1)\nand 6(M + 1), respectively.\nFor the contribution due to G1 , the standard diagrammatic bounds give an upper bound\n(2M +2)\nidentical to that for \u03a0\u0302(N)\n(y2 \u2212 y1 ). This\np , except that the factor \u03c4p (y2 \u2212 y1 ) is replaced by \u03c4p\nreplaces the bound\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2T\n(N = 0)\np\n(5.11)\n\u03a0\u0302p(N ) \u2264 \uf8f3 (0,3)\n(0,3)\nN\nTp (2Tp Tp )\n(N \u2265 1)\nof [9, Proposition 4.1] by a sum of terms in which one factor Tp(0,3) or Tp is replaced by Tp(2M +2,3) .\nThe number of terms in the sum depends only on M. By (5.5), this new upper bound is at most\nO(\u03a9\u2212M \u22121 ), as required. Thus, we are left to deal with G2 .\nTo estimate the right hand side of (5.10) with G = G2 , we may assume that each of the\nconnections in F0 , . . . , FN is achieved by a path consisting of at most 2(M + 1) bonds. On the\nother hand, there must exist an occupied path in Pj consisting of at least 10(M + 1) bonds. The\ncoexistence of this path with the disjoint occupied paths required by the event Fj implies that\nwe can find vertices a, b and disjoint paths such that two of the disjoint connections in Fj and/or\nFj+1 , say {y1 \u2194 y2 } and {y3 \u2194 y4 }, become replaced by\n{y1 \u2194 a} \u25e6 {a \u2194 y2 } \u25e6 {a \u2194 b} \u25e6 {y3 \u2194 b} \u25e6 {b \u2194 y4 }.\n\n(5.12)\n\nMoreover, the connection from a to b must be achieved by a path of length at least 2(M + 1). This\nfollows from the fact that the long occupied path in Pj can partially coincide with at most four\nof the paths realizing the connections of Fj , and these paths have total length at most 8(M + 1).\nSee Figure 1. Therefore, we can in fact replace (5.12) by\n{y1 \u2194 a}\u25e6{a \u2194 y2 }\u25e6{a \u2194 b by a path of length at least 2(M + 1)}\u25e6{y3 \u2194 b}\u25e6{b \u2194 y4 }. (5.13)\nIn an upper bound achieved via the BK inequality, the two factors \u03c4p (y1 \u2212y2 )\u03c4p (y3 \u2212y4 ) normally\npresent in the upper bound on \u03a0\u0302p(N ) are replaced by\nX\n\n\u03c4p (y1 \u2212 a)\u03c4p (a \u2212 y2 )\u03c4p(2M +2) (b \u2212 a)\u03c4p (y3 \u2212 b)\u03c4p (b \u2212 y4 )\n\na,b\n\n\u2264 sup \u03c4p(2M +2) (b \u2212 a)\na,b\n\n!\n\nX\n\n\u03c4p (y1 \u2212 a)\u03c4p (a \u2212 y2 )\n\na\n\nX\n\n\u03c4p (y3 \u2212 b)\u03c4p (b \u2212 y4 )\n\nb\n\n\u2264 22M +2 K2M +2,1 \u03a9\u2212M \u22121 (\u03c4p \u2217 \u03c4p )(y1 \u2212 y2 )(\u03c4p \u2217 \u03c4p )(y3 \u2212 y4 ),\n19\n\n(5.14)\n\n\fusing (5.7) to estimate supa,b \u03c4p(2M +2) (b \u2212 a). It remains to show that the result of replacing the\n)\nfactors \u03c4p (y1 \u2212 y2 )\u03c4p (y3 \u2212 y4 ) by (\u03c4p \u2217 \u03c4p )(y1 \u2212 y2 )(\u03c4p \u2217 \u03c4p )(y3 \u2212 y4 ), in the standard bound on \u03a0\u0302(N\np ,\ngives rise to a bounded quantity.\nThis replacement has the effect of adding a vertex to each of the lines joining y1 to y2 and y3\nto y4 in the standard diagrammatic bound on \u03a0\u0302(N)\np . This leads to a bound in which one factor of\n(0,3)\n(0,5)\n(1,5)\nTp or Tp in (5.11) is replaced by Tp or Tp , or a product of two factors of Tp(0,3) and/or Tp is\nreplaced by Tp(0,4) Tp(0,4) (taking an upper bound), depending on whether the two vertices are added\nto the same triangle or not. The result is finite by (5.5).\nProof of Lemma 4.5.

This implies that there is an\nR\nR\noccupied path in some Pi of length at least R/(M + 1), and we again take R = 10(M + 1)2 and\n)\napply Proposition 5.1. On the other hand, if Bj \u2229 C\u0303j\u22121\\C\u0303j\u22121,R \u2282 B(N\n, then a path in C\u0303j\u22121 must\nR\n(N )\ntravel from vj\u22122 outside of BR before intersecting Bj , so there must then be a path in Pj\u22121 that\n)\nexits B(N\nR , and again the previous argument applies.

By (4.1),\n)\n)\nI[ER(N) ] \u2212 I[ER(N ) on BR(N ) ] = I[ER(N ) \u2229 {(ER(N) )c on B(N\n}] \u2212 I[(ER(N) )c \u2229 {ER(N) on B(N\n}].\nR\nR\n\n20\n\n(5.22)\n\n\f)\nBy (4.4), {E (N ) on B(N\n} \u2282 F (N) , and the proof of (3.22) also easily extends to yield ER(N) \u2282 F (N) .\nR\nBy (4.1)\u2013(4.2), it follows that\n\nI[ER(N ) \u2229 {(ER(N ) )c on B(N)\n}] \u2264 I[ER(N ) ]\nR\n\nN\nX\n\n)\nI[Ej,R \u2229 {Ej,c R on B(N\n}]\nR\n\nj=0\n\n\u2264 I[F\n\n(N )\n\n]\n\nN\nX\n\n)\nI[Ej,R \u2229 {Ej,c R on B(N\n}],\nR\n\n(5.23)\n\nj=0\n(N )\n)\non B(N\nI[(ER(N ) )c \u2229 {ER(N) on B(N)\nR }] \u2264 I[{ER\nR }]\n\nN\nX\n\n)\nI[Ej,c R \u2229 {Ej,R on B(N\nR }]\n\nj=0\n\n\u2264 I[F (N ) ]\n\nN\nX\n\n)\nI[ERc ,j \u2229 {Ej,R on B(N\n}].\nR\n\n(5.24)\n\nj=0\n)\n)\nThus, it suffices to show that (i) if Ej,R \u2229 {Ej,c R on B(N\n} occurs, or (ii) if Ej,c R \u2229 {Ej,R on B(N\n}\nR\nR\n(N )\noccurs, then there is a path in Bj that exits BR .\n)\nWe first consider case (i). It is clear that if E0 \u2229 {E0c on B(N\n} occurs, then there is a path in\nR\n(N )\nB0 that exits BR . So we consider j \u2265 1. Given sets A, B of vertices, it suffices to show that if\nE \u2032 (v, x; A) \u2229 {E \u2032 (v, x; A)c on B} occurs, then there must be an occupied path from v to x that\nA\nexits B. Recall from (3.2) that the event E \u2032 (v, x; A) is the intersection of the event {v \u2194 x} with\nthe NP condition. Therefore,\n\nA\n\nI[E \u2032 (v, x; A) \u2229 {E \u2032 (v, x; A)c on B}] = I[E \u2032 (v, x; A)]I[{v \u2194 x}c on B]\nA\n\n+ I[E \u2032 (v, x; A)]I[{v \u2194 x} on B]I[NPc on B].\n\n(5.25)\n\nA\n\nIn the first term on the right hand side, the event E \u2032 (v, x; A) requires that {v \u2194 x}. If every\nA\npath from v to x stays inside B, then also {v \u2194 x} on B. The second factor therefore ensures\nthat there must be a connection from v to x that exits B, as required. In the second term on the\nright hand side, NP holds, but not on B. This means that, on B, there is a pivotal bond (u\u2032, v \u2032 )\nA\nfor the connection from v to x such that v \u2194 u\u2032 , but that there is no such bond when the entire\nconfiguration on G is used. This can only happen if there is an occupied path from v to x that\nexits B, with this path either making (u\u2032, v \u2032 ) no longer pivotal, or providing a path from v to u\u2032\nthat does not intersect A.\nNext, we consider case (ii). The case j = 0 cannot occur. We consider j \u2265 1, and proceed as\nin the proof of case (i). By (3.2),\nA\n\nI[E \u2032 (v, x; A)c \u2229 {E \u2032 (v, x; A) on B}] = I[E \u2032 (v, x; A) on B]I[{v \u2194 x}c \u2229 NP]\n+ I[E \u2032 (v, x; A) on B]I[NPc ].\nA\n\n(5.26)\n\nIn the first term on the right hand side, the event {v \u2194 x} occurs on B but does not occur on G.\nThis implies that there is an occupied path from v to x that exits B (and does not contain a vertex\nin A), as required. The second term on the right hand side is zero. To see this, we first observe\nthat the event NPc implies that (on G) there is an occupied pivotal bond (u\u2032 , v \u2032 ) for v \u2194 x such\nA\nthat v \u2194 u\u2032 . The bond (u\u2032 , v \u2032 ) must also be pivotal for the connection from v to x on B. Moreover,\n21\n\n\fA\n\nsince E \u2032 (v, x; A) occurs on B, it must be that v is connected to u\u2032 on B and {v \u2194 u\u2032 }c occurs on\nA\nB. This contradicts v \u2194 u\u2032 on G, and hence the second term is indeed zero. This completes the\nproof of (5.20).\nProof of (5.21). We begin with the identity\nI[E\n\n(N)\n\n(N )\nR\n\n] \u2212 I[E\n\n]=\n\nN j\u22121\nX\nY\n\n\u0010\n\nI[Ei,R ] I[Ej ] \u2212 I[Ej,R ]\n\nj=1 i=0\n\nN\n\u0011 Y\n\nI[Ei ],\n\n(5.27)\n\ni=j+1\n\nin which the absent term with j = 0 is equal to zero. It suffices to show that |I[Ej ] \u2212 I[Ej,R ]|\nis bounded above by the indicator that Bj intersects C\u0303j\u22121 \\ C\u0303j,R, multiplied by either I[Ej ] or\nI[Ej,R ]. The former gives rise to the summand on the right hand side of (5.21), while the latter,\nin combination with the products over i in (5.27), ensures that all connections necessary to imply\nF (N) are present. We proceed to obtain this estimate for |I[Ej ] \u2212 I[Ej,R ]|.\nFor A \u2282 A\u2032 , we write\nI[E \u2032 (v, x; A\u2032 )] \u2212 I[E \u2032 (v, x; A)] = I[E \u2032 (v, x; A)c \u2229 E \u2032 (v, x; A\u2032 )] \u2212 I[E \u2032 (v, x; A) \u2229 E \u2032 (v, x; A\u2032 )c ],\n(5.28)\nand we consider the two terms on the right hand side separately. For the first term, we use the fact\nthat if NP occurs for A\u2032 then it also occurs for A. Therefore, the event in the first term implies\nA\nA\u2032\nthat E \u2032 (v, x; A\u2032 ) \u2229 {v \u2194 x} \u2229 {v \u2194 x}c occurs. In particular, there must be an occupied path from\nA\nA\u2032\nv to x that intersects A\u2032 \\ A. Similarly, for the second term in (5.28), we have {v \u2194 x} \u2282 {v \u2194 x},\nso the event of the second term implies that E \u2032 (v, x; A) occurs, and that the NP condition holds\nfor A, but not for A\u2032 . The latter implies that, as required, there is an occupied path from v to x\ncontaining an element in A\u2032 \\ A. This completes the proof of (5.21), and completes the proof of\nthe lemma.\n~ but {D\n~ on V(N ) , then there must be an\n~ = d,\n~ < d}\nProof of Lemma 4.6. We first argue that if D\n~R\nd,\noccupied path of length at least 10(M + 1) in some Pj , and hence,\n~ on V(N) ]I[D\n~ \u2264\n~ < d}\n~ = d]\nI[{D\n~R\nd,\n\nX\n\n~\n~ = d].\nI[\u2203 occupied \u03c9 \u2208 Pj \\ Pj,10(M +1) ]I[D\n\n(5.29)\n\nj\n\nSuppose, to the contrary, that all occupied paths in each Pj have length at most 10(M + 1).

Then if D\n~\nd,R\n~\npaths that determine D travel at most a distance 10(M + 1) in each of the N + 1 expectations,\nand hence travel a total distance at most 10(M + 1)(N + 1) \u2264 R. This proves (5.29).\nWe substitute (5.29) into the left hand side of (4.45), perform the sum over d~ using the indicator\n~ and apply Proposition 5.1, to obtain the desired estimate.\n~ = d],\nI[D\nProof of Lemma 4.8. We again assume some familiarity with the methods of [9, Section 4]. Fix\nM and N \u2264 M, and fix a positive number a < 1.\n~ > R. By Proposition 5.1, we need only consider the\nSuppose that F (N) occurs and that kDk\ncase in which all occupied paths in each Pj have length at most 10(Ra + 1), since the complement\nobeys the desired estimate with gR = Ra + 1. We make this assumption throughout the proof.\n22\n\n\fGiven a bond configuration, we can select a sequence of occupied level-j paths \u03b7ij \u2208 Pj (a path\nmay consist of a single vertex and the paths need not be disjoint), for i = 1, 2, 3 and j = 0, . . . , N,\nj\nj\nj\nwhich together ensure that F (N) = \u2229N\nj=0 Fj occurs (see (5.9)). In Figure 2, the paths \u03b71 , \u03b72 , \u03b73\nare the two paths joining vj\u22121 to uj and the path joining vj\u22121 to Bj+1 . Denote the union of the\nvertices in \u03b71j , \u03b72j , \u03b73j by Aj , and let A = \u222aN\nj=0 Aj . By our assumption, the set A explores at most\na\na\n(N +1)30(R +1) \u2264 30(M +1)(R +1) dimensions. We consider the case where R is large (depending\non M), so that in particular R > 30(M + 1)(Ra + 1). This implies that there must be additional\noccupied paths in \u222aN\nj=0 Pj that explore additional dimensions. In fact, there must be some j for\nwhich the number of dimensions explored at level-j exceeds R\u2032 = (M +1)\u22121 [R\u221230(M +1)(Ra +1)],\nand hence the number of these paths exceeds R\u2032\u2032 = R\u2032 /10(Ra + 1). We fix such a j. More precisely,\n~ > R, we can find a j and a sequence of occupied paths\ngiven a bond configuration for which kDk\n\u03c91 , . . . , \u03c9R\u2032\u2032 \u2208 Pj , such that \u03c91 enters a dimension not entered by A, and, for l \u2265 2, \u03c9l enters a\ndimension not entered by A \u222a (\u222ak<l \u03c9k ), where the union refers to a union of vertices. Note that\nsince a < 1, R\u2032\u2032 \u2192 \u221e as R \u2192 \u221e with M fixed.\nThe paths \u03b7ij (j = 0, . . . , N, i = 1, 2, 3) ensure that the disjoint connections required by the\nevent F (N) occur. If we were to neglect the fact that the paths \u03c9l are occupied, an application of\n)\nthe BK inequality would lead to the standard diagrammatic estimates for \u03a0\u0302(N\np , as described, e.g.,\nin [9, Section 4]. With this in mind, we take the paths \u03c9l into account sequentially, as follows.\nFirst, since \u03c91 enters a dimension not yet entered by Aj (where j is the special level fixed\nabove), there is a vertex in \u03c91 that is not in any of the \u03b7ij (i = 1, 2, 3). By following \u03c91 forward\nand backwards until it hits Aj or Bj+1 for the first time, we obtain a portion \u03c91\u2032 of \u03c91 that begins\nin Aj and ends in either Aj or Bj+1 and that is disjoint from the paths \u03b7ij .\nIf \u03c91\u2032 both begins and ends in Aj , then it has the effect of connecting two vertices on the paths\nj\n\u03b71 , \u03b72j , \u03b73j by an occupied path which is disjoint from these paths. If we apply the BK inequality in\nthis situation, we produce Feynman diagrams that are constructed from those bounding \u03a0\u0302(N)\nby\np\nadding two vertices on diagram lines and joining them by a new line. In other words, we replace\nthe product (say) \u03c4p (y2 \u2212 y1 )\u03c4p (y4 \u2212 y3 ) by\nX\n\n\u03c4p (y2 \u2212 a)\u03c4p (a \u2212 y1 )\u03c4p (y4 \u2212 b)\u03c4p (b \u2212 y3 )\u03c4p(1) (b \u2212 a)\n\n(5.30)\n\na,b\n\nas in (5.12). As in the proof of Proposition 5.1, we bound the factor supa,b \u03c4p(1) (b \u2212 a) by K\u03a9\u22121\nusing (5.7), and we are left with a diagram with two additional vertices a, b. This diagram was\nbounded by a constant in the proof of Proposition 5.1.\nIf \u03c91\u2032 begins in Aj and ends in Bj+1 , then this has the effect of augmenting \u03b71j , \u03b72j , \u03b73j with\na disjoint path from a vertex on one of these paths to the end of \u03c91\u2032 in Bj+1 . Call this latter\nendpoint w. Since w is in the first entry of \u03c91\u2032 into Bj+1 , we can augment the level-(j + 1) paths\n\u03b71j+1, \u03b72j+1 , \u03b73j+1 by a disjoint level-(j + 1) path passing through w, as indicated in Figure 2. If\nwe apply the BK inequality to this configuration, the result is a sum of Feynman diagrams, with\nextra lines due to these additional disjoint connections. We can begin to bound this diagram by\nextracting a factor supa,b \u03c4p(1) (b \u2212 a) \u2264 K\u03a9\u22121 from the connection due to \u03c91\u2032 , and then a factor\nTp(0,2) \u2264 K0,2 due to the level-(j + 1) connections that contain w and are bond-disjoint from the\n)\nlevel-(j + 1) connections \u03b7ij+1. This leaves a standard \u03a0\u0302(N\ndiagram with at most three extra\np\nvertices, and this is bounded by a constant by standard bounds, using (5.5) (provided we take the\ndimension sufficiently large).\n23\n\n\fuj\u22121 vj\u22121\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nuj vj\n\nw\n\nuj+1 vj+1\n\n\u03c91\u2032\n\nFigure 2: Examples of disjoint connections required by \u03c91\u2032 . The path \u03c91\u2032 is a level-j path, whereas\nthe other two dotted paths are part of the level-(j + 1) backbone.\nThe above explains the procedure if there were only one path \u03c91 . However, we are interested\nin the situation where there is a large number R\u2032\u2032 of paths \u03c9l . In this case, we first find the path\n\u03c91\u2032 as above. Because \u03c92 explores a dimension not entered by A \u222a \u03c91 , we can find a subpath \u03c92\u2032\nof \u03c92 that starts at a vertex in \u03b71j , \u03b72j , \u03b73j or \u03c91\u2032 and ends either in this set or in Bj+1, and that is\ndisjoint from \u03b71j , \u03b72j , \u03b73j and \u03c91\u2032 . If \u03c92\u2032 ends in Bj+1 , then we can find disjoint level-(j + 1) paths\nas explained above. If we had only these two paths \u03c91\u2032 , \u03c92\u2032 , we would apply the BK inequality as\nusual to produce a Feynman diagram, and then estimate this diagram by first bounding the lines\ncreated by \u03c92\u2032 , obtaining a factor \u03a9\u22121 from the fact that \u03c92\u2032 takes at least one step, then bounding\nthe lines created by \u03c91\u2032 , obtaining a second factor \u03a9\u22121 . This leaves a standard \u03a0\u0302(N)\ndiagram with\np\nat most six additional vertices, and this can be bounded by a constant.\nThe general case is handled similarly. Each \u03c9l\u2032 gives rise to a diagram line that produces a factor\n\u2032\u2032\n\u22121\n\u03a9 , creating an overall factor \u03a9\u2212R . In bounding diagram lines iteratively, we may encounter\nlines with extra vertices (where lines already bounded were previously attached). However, the\nnumber of these vertices on any one line is less than 4R\u2032\u2032 , since each \u03c9l\u2032 adds in total at most four\nvertices to the diagram, as in Figure 2. After all the lines due to the \u03c9l\u2032 have been bounded using\n)\nsuprema, we are left with a standard \u03a0\u0302(N\ndiagram, again with at most 4R\u2032\u2032 extra vertices. This is\np\n\u2032\u2032\nbounded by a constant depending on R and M, for n sufficiently large, using (5.5). The number\nof diagrams produced depends only on M and R\u2032\u2032 . Since R\u2032\u2032 < R, we end up with an overall bound\n\u2032\u2032\nthat is a constant multiple of \u03a9\u2212R , where the constant depends on R and M.\nThis completes the proof.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Christian Borgs, Jennifer Chayes and Joel Spencer for many stimulating discussions\nrelated to this work.
