In a gauge theory one typically considers\nthe overlap of a state created by a gauge-invariant operator O(x) with a multiparticle\nstate h1 * * * n| described by the particles' momenta p1 , . . . , pn and other relevant quantum numbers such as the helicity, for massless particles. We will usually consider the\nFourier transform of the form factor,\nZ\n\nd4 x e\u2212iqx h1 * * * n|O(x)|0i = \u03b4 (4) (q \u2212\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\npi ) h1 * * * n|O(0)|0i ,\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere the momentum delta function appears as a consequence of translational invariance of the theory, with O(x) = exp(iPx)O(0) exp(\u2212iPx).\n\nForm factors appear in several interesting physical contexts. Some of the early\napplications include the amplitude for deep inelastic scattering, which is controlled\ne.m.\ne.m.\nby the matrix element hX|Jh,\u03bc\n(0)|pi of the hadronic electromagnetic current Jh,\u03bc\nwith an initial proton state p and a final hadronic state X, and the e+ e\u2212 \u2192 X\ne.m.\nannihilation process, governed by the form factor hX|Jh,\u03bc\n(0)|0i. Furthermore, the\nuniversal structure of infrared divergences of amplitudes is controlled by the Sudakov\nform factor [1\u20137], with the coefficient of the leading infrared divergence being related\nto the cusp anomalous dimension [8] and the large-spin limit of twist-two operators [9].\nIts universal, exponential form has inspired the all-loop conjecture for planar MHV\namplitudes in N = 4 super Yang Mills (SYM) [10]. Another interesting application\nof form factors is the operator product expansion of null polygonal Wilson loops\nproposed recently in [11].\nUltimately, one of the important goals and motivations for the study of form factors in N = 4 SYM is that they interpolate between off-shell and on-shell quantities.\nFor off-shell quantities such as two-point correlation functions, integrability has been\ndeveloped into a powerful computational tool,1 and it also plays an important role\nin the calculation of amplitudes [13, 14] and form factors [15, 16] at strong coupling.\n1\n\nFor a recent review see [12] and references therein.\n\n2\n\n\fOn the other hand, for amplitudes at weak coupling we have so far only glimpses\nof hidden integrable structures, and we hope that this interpolation will give us new\ninsights on the role and uses of integrability in the context of amplitudes.\nForm factors in maximally N = 4 super Yang-Mills at strong coupling were recently\nconsidered in [15, 16]. At weak coupling, they were first considered in [17], and in\ngreater detail and generality in [18] and [19]. In particular, [18] considered form\nfactors of the half-BPS scalar operator Tr(\u03c612 \u03c612 ) in N = 4 SYM at tree level and\none loop, where \u03c6AB are the six scalar fields in the theory, A, B = 1, . . . , 4, with\n\u03c6AB = \u2212\u03c6BA , with external states containing two scalars and an arbitrary number\nof positive-helicity gluons. These MHV form factors were found to be remarkably\nsimple. Specifically, at tree level they are expressed in terms of a holomorphic function\nof the spinor variables associated to the particle momenta which is a close cousin of\nthe Parke-Taylor MHV scattering amplitude [20]. This simplicity was also found to\npersist at one loop, where the result for these MHV form factors is a remarkably\nsimple expression which is very reminiscent of that for an n-point MHV amplitude\nat one loop.\nIn this paper we continue the systematic study initiated in [18]. The preceding\ndiscussion has already outlined two of the motivations for this study. Firstly, the\nattempt at connecting the on-shell world of scattering amplitudes (with a flurry of\nnew techniques discovered over the past seven years) to that of off-shell observables\nin the theory, with integrability playing a prominent role in determining the quantum\nstructure of some of these observables at strong and weak coupling. The second motivation is that form factors are expressed by simple formulae despite being partially\noff shell. As we shall see, certain form factors exhibit further unexpected simplicities,\nsuch as the maximally non-MHV form factors. More concretely, in this paper we\npursue the following objectives.\nIn Section 2 we begin by extending to form factors some distinguished on-shell\ntechniques used successfully over the past years to calculate amplitudes, such as MHV\ndiagrams [21] and on-shell recursion relations [22, 23]. Some of these findings are not\nunexpected \u2013 for example, MHV rules are related to an MHV Lagrangian which is\napplicable also off shell [24], and recursion relations are based on factorisation, which\nis a general property not only of amplitudes but also of Green's functions [25]. Notice\nthat MHV diagrams are expected to work also in the presence of multiple operator\ninsertions. As an application, we will explicitly solve the recursion relations for form\nfactors where the external state is made of gluons in a split-helicity configuration.\nThis parallels a corresponding explicit solution for amplitudes found in [26].\nSection 3 - a central part of this paper - is devoted to supersymmetric form\nfactors. We will find that harmonic superspace [27,28] is a very convenient framework\nto formulate and study such objects. More precisely, we consider form factors where\nthe operator inserted is the chiral part of the stress-tensor multiplet operator, which\npreserves half of the supersymmetries off shell [29, 30], while the state is described\n3\n\n\fusing the supersymmetric formalism of Nair [31]. Using a chiral superspace formulation we write down supersymmetric Ward identities for these form factors, and show\nhow they constrain their form. As a particular application of these techniques we derive the maximally non-MHV form factors which turn out to be surprisingly simple.\nFinally, we study form factors of the full stress-tensor multiplet operator for which\nwe introduce a non-chiral superspace representation.\nIn Section 4 we briefly introduce supersymmetric MHV diagrams, supersymmetric\nrecursion relations and unitarity for form factors. These generalisations are rather\nstraightforward, so our presentation here is somewhat condensed.\nFinally, in Section 5 we introduce dual MHV rules for form factors formulated\ndirectly in dual (super) momentum space by giving various examples at tree and oneloop level, and point out and explain certain subtleties encountered at higher loops. In\nthis construction, a certain periodic kinematic configuration, emerging in the strongcoupling calculation of [15, 16], plays a central role, and we discuss similarities with\n(and differences from) the Wilson loop/amplitude duality [32\u201334].\nThe understanding of the large-z behaviour of form factors is crucial in formulating\nthe recursion relation, and is analysed in detail in Appendix A. Finally, in Appendix\nB we provide a brief reminder of the dual MHV rules for amplitudes.\n\n2\n\nTree-level methods\n\nIn this section we will develop and extend tree-level methods for form factors by\ngeneralising the corresponding methods for amplitudes, namely MHV diagrams [21]\nand on-shell recursions relations [22, 23].2 We then proceed to obtain several new\nresults including the NMHV and all split-helicity cases. We will not present the\ncalculations with both methods for all examples but wish to stress here that we have\nmade extensive checks to confirm that the results obtained with either method always\nagree. The supersymmetrisation of these methods will be considered in Section 4.\n\n2.1\n\nMHV diagrams\n\nWe start with a simple extension of the MHV diagram method [21] to form factors.\nWe will test this here only in tree-level calculations, but the extension to loop level,\nfollowing [36], is straightforward.\nSpecifically, we will be interested in calculating NMHV form factors of the simplest\nclass of operators in N = 4 SYM, namely the half-BPS operators Tr(\u03c612 \u03c612 ). They\n2\n\nFor a recent review of tree-level methods in gauge theory and gravity, see [35].\n\n4\n\n\ftake the form\nh g +(p1 ) * * * \u03c612 (pi ) * * * \u03c612 (pj ) * * * g + (pn\u22121 ) g \u2212(pn ) |Tr(\u03c612 \u03c612 )(x)| 0 i ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere all but one of the gluons have positive helicity. The strategy of the calculation\nis very simple \u2013 we need to augment the set of usual MHV vertices for amplitudes by\nincluding a new family of MHV vertices, obtained by continuing off shell the tree-level\nMHV form factors of the half-BPS operators. The expressions for these quantities\nwere derived in [18], and are given by\nZ\nd4 x e\u2212iqx hg + (p1 ) * * * \u03c612 (pi ) * * * \u03c612 (pj ) * * * g + (pn )|Tr(\u03c612 \u03c612 )(x)|0i\n=g\n\nn\u22122\n\n4 (4)\n\n(2\u03c0) \u03b4 (\n\nn\nX\nk=1\n\n\u03bbk \u03bb\u0303k \u2212 q) FMHV ,\n\nwhere\nFMHV =\n\nhiji2\n.\nh12i * * * hn1i\n\n(2.2)\n\n(2.3)\n\nP\nHere pm := \u03bbm \u03bb\u0303m are on-shell momenta of the external particles, and q := nm=1 pm\nis the momentum carried by the operator insertion. It was observed in [18] that,\nsince (2.3) is a holomorphic function of the spinor variables, the MHV form factors\nare localised on a complex line in twistor space, similarly to the MHV amplitudes [37].\nUsing localisation as an inspiration, we propose to use an appropriate off-shell\ncontinuation of (2.3) as a new vertex to construct the perturbative expansion of\nnon-MHV form factors of the operator Tr(\u03c612 \u03c612 ). The off-shell continuation is the\nstandard one introduced in [21]. The momentum L of an internal, off-shell particle\nis decomposed as L = l + z\u03be, where l = \u03bbL \u03bb\u0303L is an on-shell momentum and \u03be\nan arbitrary reference null momentum.

However, we mention that all results derived\nin the next subsection using recursion relations have been compared with formulae\nobtained from MHV diagrams finding a perfect match in all cases.\n\n2.2\n\nRecursion relations\n\nIn this subsection we study the application of recursion relations to the derivation\nof tree-level form factors. As a warm-up we will re-derive the NMHV form factor in\n6\n\n\f(2.5) finding agreement with (2.7), and then move on to consider more general cases\nincluding split-helicity configurations. Since form factors contain a single operator\ninsertion, it is clear that every recursive diagram will contain one amplitude and one\nform factor as the factorisation properties used in the case of tree-level recursions for\namplitudes also apply to tree-level form factors. This is the only modification to the\non-shell recursion relations of [22]. In Appendix A we discuss the behaviour of form\nfactors under large complex deformations, and confirm the validity of the calculations\nbelow, i.e. we show that under the shifts used the form factors vanish as z \u2192 \u221e.\nLet us begin by re-deriving the NMHV form factor (2.5). We will use a [34i shift,\nnamely\n\u02c6\n\u03bb\u03033 := \u03bb\u03033 + z \u03bb\u03034 ,\n\u03bb\u03024 := \u03bb4 \u2212 z\u03bb3 .\n(2.8)\n\nThere are two recursive diagrams, depicted in Figure 2 below.

As we will show shortly, performing a [q, q + 1i shift leads\nto a general, closed-form solution of the BCFW recursion relations for this special\nclass of form factors. Note that all split-helicity gluon scattering amplitudes were\ncomputed in [26] \u2013 we construct here a similar solution for form factors.\nEach recursive diagram with a [q, q + 1i shift contains a three-point amplitude and\nan (n \u2212 1)-point form factor.

Crucially, all\nlower-point form factors appearing in (2.13) are of split-helicity form, so that the\nsplit helicity form factors are closed under recursions. Once we have reduced the\n3\n\nFor the rest of this section we will always assume that the operator O = Tr(\u03c612 \u03c612 ) is inserted\nand will not mention it explicitly. Although the solution is presented for this particular insertion,\nthe construction can be generalised to form factors involving other operators.\n\n8\n\n\fform factor to expressions that involve only MHV and MHV terms, we can insert the\nshifted momenta.\n\nF1,2\nF0,2\n\nF2,1\nF1,1\n\nF0,1\n\nM\nH\nV\n\nV\nH\nM\nN\n\nV\nH\nM\n\nF0,3\n\nF2,2\n\nN\nM\nH\nV\n\nIt is useful to illustrate the structure of the recursion relations for split-helicity\nform factors using a square lattice as in Figure 3. Consider for example the form\nfactor F2,2 . In this case, the first iteration using equation (2.13) relates F2,2 to the\nform factors F2,1 and F1,2 , which however are neither MHV nor MHV. The next\niteration leads to an expression involving one F2,0 , two F1,1 's and one F0,2 evaluated\nat some shifted momenta. A final iteration would then allow us to express the answer\nin terms of MHV and MHV form factors alone, or even to reduce everything down\nto F0,0 . It is also easy to see that this pattern generalises to arbitrary split-helicity\nform factors and that each term generated by subsequent recursions corresponds to\na unique path between the form factor and the MHV or MHV edges of the lattice, as\nillustrated in Figure 3.\n\nF3,0\nF2,0\n\nF1,0\nF0,0\n\nFigure 3: The iterative structure of split-helicity form factors illustrated by a square\nlattice. The three coloured paths ending on the MHV line are in one-to-one correspondence with terms that appear in the iterated recursion of F2,2 . Similarly there will be\nthree paths (terms) that end on the MHV line.\nIn principle, all we need to do to compute a split-helicity form factor is to collect\nall prefactors picked up at each step of the recursion process and follow the iterated\nmomentum shifts along a particular path on the lattice.\n2.2.2\n\nSolution for the split-helicity form factor\n\nA very efficient way to organise the recursion is in terms of zig-zag diagrams, like\nthose introduced in [26] for split-helicity gluon amplitudes. It is natural to split the\nterms of the solution into those corresponding to paths ending on the MHV or MHV\nlines, respectively.\nZig-zag diagrams that correspond to recursion terms with an MHV form factor\nwill be denoted as MHV zig-zags and the ones with an MHV form factor as MHV\n9\n\n\fzig-zags. Note that we have therefore two types of diagrams, in contrast to the case\nof amplitudes in [26]. One can make this separation also for amplitudes as it only\nmeans that we terminate the iterated recursion once we reach an MHV term, instead\nof recursing it further down to F0,0 (or A2,2 for the case of amplitudes). In the path\npicture of the previous section, this separation corresponds to the fact that there is\na unique path between any MHV form factor and F0,0 , hence one can replace that\npart of the recursion directly with an MHV form factor. Because the MHV zig-zags\ndefined below are not compatible with two point objects such as F0,0 we chose to use\nthis formalism with two types of diagrams. This has the added advantage that it\nmakes the parity symmetry of Fq\u22122,q\u22122 form factors manifest.\nThe MHV zig-zags are parameterised with 2k + 1 labels\n2 \u2264 a1 < * * * < ak < q \u2212 1 and n \u2265 b1 > * * * > bk+1 > q,\n\nk \u2265 0,\n\nrepresenting expressions in the following manner\nq\u22121\n\na1 a1 + 1\n\nq\n\n2\n=\n1\nn\n\nb1 + 1 b1\n\nb2 + 1 b2\n\nN1 N2 N3\nD1 D2 D3\n\n(2.16)\n\nq+2q+1\n\nwhile the MHV zig-zags are parametrised with 2k + 1 labels\n2 \u2264 b\u03041 < * * * < b\u0304k+1 < q\n\nand n \u2265 \u01011 > * * * > \u0101k > q + 1,\n\nk \u2265 0,\n\nrepresenting expressions, similarly shown below\n3\n\nb\u03041 b\u03041 + 1\n\nb\u03042 b\u03042 + 1\n\nq\u22121\n\nq\n\n2\n=\n1\nn\n\n\u01011 + 1 \u01011\n\nq+2q+1\n\n10\n\nN\u03041 N\u03042 N\u03043\nD\u03041 D\u03042 D\u03043\n\n(2.17)\n\n\fwhere N1,2,3 and D1,2,3 are defined as\nN1 = h1|P2,b1 Pa1 +1,b1 Pa1 +1,b2 Pa2 +1,b2 * * * Pq,bk+1 |qi\n\u00d7 [2|Pa1 +1,b1 Pa1 +1,b2 Pa2 +1,b2 * * * Pq,bk+1 |qi2\n\nN2 = hb1 + 1 b1 ihb2 + 1 b2 i * * * hbk+1 + 1 bk+1i\nN3 = [a1 a1 + 1] * * * [ak ak + 1]\n2\n2\nD1 = P2,b\nP2\nP2\nP2\n* * * Pq,b\n1 a1 +1,b1 a1 +1,b2 a2 +1,b2\nk+1\n\nD2 = Zq,1 Z\u03042,q\u22121\nD3 = [2|P2,b1 |b1 + 1ihb1 |Pa1 +1,b1 |a1 ][a1 + 1|Pa1 +1,b2 |b2 + 1i * * * hbk+1 |Pq,bk+1 |q \u2212 1]\n(2.18a)\n\nN\u03041 = [q + 1|Pb\u0304k+1 +1,q+1 , . . . , Pb\u03042 +1,\u01012 , Pb\u03042 +1,\u01011 , Pb\u03041 +1,\u01011 |1i2\n\n\u00d7 [q + 1|Pb\u0304k+1 +1,q+1 , . . . , Pb\u03042 +1,\u01012 , Pb\u03042 +1,\u01011 , Pb\u03041 +1,\u01011 Pb\u03041 +1,1 |2]\n\nN\u03042 = [b\u03041 b\u03041 + 1] * * * [b\u0304k+1 b\u0304k+1 + 1]\nN\u03043 = h\u01011 + 1 \u01011 i * * * h\u0101k + 1 \u0101k i\nD\u03041 = Pb\u030421 +1,1 Pb\u030421 +1,\u01011 Pb\u030422 +1,\u01011 . . .

By solving\nthese Ward identities, we will learn about the structure of these form factors.\nTo begin, we recall the familiar fact that in N = 4 SYM one can efficiently package\nall scattering amplitudes with fixed total helicity and fixed number of particles n into\na superamplitude [31], thereby making manifest some of the supersymmetries of the\ntheory. This object depends on auxiliary fermionic variables \u03b7i,A , one for each particle\ni = 1, . . . , n, with A an anti-fundamental SU(4) index. The superamplitude can be\nTaylor-expanded in the \u03b7 variables, with a specific correspondence between powers of\n\u03b7 and particular external states. This correspondence can be read off from the Nair\nsuper-wavefunction [31], which encodes all the annihilation operators of the physical\nstates,\n\u03b7A \u03b7B AB\n\u03b7A \u03b7B \u03b7C\n\u03a6(p, \u03b7) := g + (p) + \u03b7A \u03bbA (p) +\n\u03bb\u0304D (p) + \u03b71 \u03b72 \u03b73 \u03b74 g \u2212 (p) ,\n\u03c6 (p) + \u01ebABCD\n2!\n3!\n(3.1)\n+\n\u2212\nwhere (g (p), . . . , g (p)) are the annihilation operators of the corresponding states.\nIn order to select a state with a particular helicity hi , we need to expand the superamplitude and pick the term with 2 \u2212 2hi powers of \u03b7i .\nThis familiar framework becomes richer for form factors. Indeed, one can consider\nform factors of bosonic operators \u2013 such as Tr(\u03c6AB \u03c6AB ) \u2013 with an external supersymmetric state described using the Nair approach, but one can also supersymmetrise\nthe operator itself, as we shall see in the next section.\n\nA comment on notation \u2013 we denote a form factor as h0|\u03a6(1) * * * \u03a6(n) O |0i or\nequivalently h1 * * * n| O |0i, where |ii := \u03a6\u2020 (i)|0i is a Nair superstate, which satisfies\nh i | P = h i | pi ,\n\nh i | Q = h i | \u03bbi \u03b7i ,\n\nh i | Q\u0304 = h i |\n\n\u2202\n\u03bb\u0303i ,\n\u2202\u03b7i\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere the derivative in the last equation acts on the state on its left. We also adopt\nthe notation h1 * * * n| := h0|\u03a6(1) * * * \u03a6(n).\n\n3.1\n\nForm factor of the chiral stress-tensor multiplet operator\n\nWe now consider the form factor of the chiral supersymmetric operator4 T (x, \u03b8+ )\nconsidered recently in [29, 30].

Ward identities\nassociated with a certain symmetry generator s which leaves the vacuum invariant\nare obtained in a standard way [38\u201341] by expanding the identity\n0 = h0|[s , \u03a6(1) * * * \u03a6(n) O ]|0i ,\n\n(3.4)\n\nor\n0 = h0|\u03a6(1) * * * \u03a6(n) [s , O] |0i +\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\nh0| \u03a6(1) * * * [s , \u03a6(i)] * * * \u03a6(n) O|0i .\n\n(3.5)\n\nFor instance, by considering s to be the momentum generator P and using [P\u03bc , O(x)] =\n\u2212i\u2202\u03bc O(x) as well as the first equation of (3.2), we obtain\n\u2212 i h0|\u03a6(1) * * * \u03a6(n) \u2202\u03bc O(x) |0i + (\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\npi )h0|\u03a6(1) * * * \u03a6(n) O(x)|0i = 0 .\n\n(3.6)\n\nFourier transforming x to q and integrating by parts one obtains\n(q \u2212\n\nn\nX\n\npi )F (q; 1, . . . , n) = 0 ,\n\ni=1\n\nwhere\nF (q; 1, . . . , n) :=\nFrom this it follows that\n\n(3.7)\n\nZ\n\nd4 x e\u2212iqx h1 * * * n|O(x) |0i .\n\nF (q; 1, . . . , n) = C * \u03b4 (4) (q \u2212\n\nn\nX\n\npi ) .\n\n(3.8)\n\n(3.9)\n\ni=1\n\nC can be fixed by further integrating both sides of (3.9) with a d4 q measure and using\n(3.8), which leads to C = h0|\u03a6(1) * * * \u03a6(n) O(0) |0i = h1 * * * n|O(0) |0i .\n16\n\n\fSimilarly, we now consider Ward identities for the harmonic projections Q\u03b1\u00b1a ,\na = 1, 2, of the Q-supersymmetry generators. We obtain\n+\n\n0 = h0| \u03a6(1) * * * \u03a6(n)[Q\u00b1 , T (x, \u03b8 )] |0i +\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\nh0| \u03a6(1) * * * [Q\u00b1 , \u03a6(i)] * * * \u03a6(n) T (x, \u03b8+ ) |0i .\n\n(3.10)\nWe now have to discuss how supersymmetry acts on the chiral part of T (x, \u03b8+ ) as\nwell as on the states.\nIn general the supersymmetry algebra closes only up to gauge transformations\nand equations of motion,5 however we consider here gauge-invariant operators such\nas T which, furthermore, are made only of a subset of all fields, namely \u03c6AB , \u03bbA\n\u03b1 and\nF\u03b1\u03b2 . It is an important fact that the algebra of the Q-generators closes off shell on\nthe chiral part of T [29], and hence these generators can be realised as differential\noperators. Of course, representing the Q\u0304-generators in terms of differential operators\nis, in general, problematic, because the full supersymmetry algebra closes only on\nshell.\nMoreover, for the chiral operator T (x, \u03b8+ ) we have broken Q\u0304\u2212 since we have set\n\u03b8 = 0 and hence we do not have a representation for this operator. For the Q\u00b1 variation of T (x, \u03b8+ ) we have,\n\u2212\n\n\u2202\nT (x, \u03b8+ ) .\n(3.11)\n\u2202\u03b8+\nNote that since we consider the chiral part of the stress-tensor multiplet we have set\n\u03b8\u0304 = 0 and hence we have dropped \u03b8\u0304 dependent terms in the realisation of Q and\nQ\u0304. Then the first relation is obvious since T (x, \u03b8+ ) is independent of \u03b8\u2212 . This also\nmakes manifest the fact that all component operators of T (x, \u03b8+ ) are annihilated by\nQ\u03b1\u2212a [29]. On the other hand, Q\u03b1+a relates different components of the supermultiplet,\nas the second relation in (3.11) shows.\n[Q\u2212 , T (x, \u03b8+ )] = 0 ,\n\n[Q+ , T (x, \u03b8+ )] = i\n\nWe define the super form factor as the super Fourier transform of the matrix\nelement h1 * * * n|T (x, \u03b8+ ) |0i, i.e.\nZ\n+a \u03b1\nFT (q, \u03b3+ ; 1, . . . , n) := d4 x d4 \u03b8+ e\u2212(iqx+i\u03b8\u03b1 \u03b3+a ) h 1 * * * n |T (x, \u03b8+ ) |0i ,\n(3.12)\n\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\nwhere \u03b3+a\nis the Fourier-conjugate variable to \u03b8\u03b1+a . Note that there is no \u03b3\u2212a\nvariable,\n\u2212a\nsince \u03b8\u03b1 has been set to zero in order to define the chiral part of the stress-tensor\nmultiplet.

More precisely, an inspection of the supersymmetry transformations of the fields reveals that a\nQ\u0304\u2212 transformation on the chiral part of the stress-tensor multiplet produces operators\nwhich are part of the full stress-tensor multiplet but not of its chiral truncation. Also,\nsince [Q\u2212 , T (x, \u03b8+ )] = 0 we cannot realise Q\u0304\u2212 such that its anticommutator with Q\u2212\ngives a translation. One could of course still write a Ward identity for Q\u0304\u2212 , but this\nwould involve operators of the full multiplet.\nOn the other hand, the Q\u0304+ -supersymmetry charge moves in the opposite direction\nof Q+ across the different components of T (x, \u03b8+ ), and is therefore realised as Q\u0304+\n\u03b1\u0307 =\n\u2212\u03b8+ \u03b1 \u2202/\u2202x\u03b1\u0307\u03b1 .\n\nWe should stress at this point that the supersymmetry algebra on component\nfields closes only up to equations of motion and gauge transformations (the latter\ndrop out since we consider gauge invariant operators). An important exception is the\nsubalgebra formed by the Q's alone which does close off-shell for the fields appearing\nin T (x, \u03b8+ ) [29]. Now we use the fact that matrix elements of terms proportional to\nequations of motion vanish at tree level, to argue that for our tree-level form factors\nthe algebra formed by Q+ and Q\u0304+ does close and, therefore, can be realised in the\nfashion described above. Thus, we can consider the Q\u0304+ Ward identity, which gives,\nafter integrating by parts and using the third relation of (3.2),\nn\nX\ni=1\n\n\u03bb\u0303i\n\n\u2202\n\u2202 \u0001\n\u2212q\nFT (q, \u03b3+ ; 1, . . . , n) = 0 .\n\u2202\u03b7+,i\n\u2202\u03b3+\n\n(3.17)\n\nActing on (3.15), we obtain the following relation for R,\n#\n\" n\nn\nn\nn\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2212q\nR = 0.\n\u03b4 (4) (q\u2212\n\u03bbi \u03bb\u0303i ) \u03b4 (4) \u03b3+ \u2212\n\u03b7+,i \u03bbi \u03b4 (4)\n\u03b7\u2212,i \u03bbi\n\u03bb\u0303i\n\u2202\u03b7+,i\n\u2202\u03b3+\ni=1\ni=1\ni=1\ni=1\n(3.18)\n18\n\n\fNotice that (3.18) implies a realisation of the supersymmetry generators on the form\nfactor as\nn\nn\nX\nX\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\nQ+a =\n\u03bbi \u03b7+a,i \u2212 \u03b3+a ,\nQ\u2212a =\n\u03bb\u03b1i \u03b7\u2212a,i ,\n(3.19)\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nwhereas for Q\u0304+a\n\u03b1\u0307 ,\n\nQ\u0304+a\n\u03b1\u0307\n\n=\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03bb\u0303i,\u03b1\u0307\n\ni=1\n\n3.2\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2212 q\u03b1\u03b1\u0307\n.\n\u2202\u03b7+a,i\n\u2202\u03b3\u03b1 +a\n\n(3.20)\n\nExamples\n\nIn the previous section we have derived the general form of the supersymmetric form\nfactor defined in (3.12). This expression is given in (3.15), and was obtained by\nsolving Ward identities related to translations and Q\u00b1 -supersymmetries. The use of\nQ\u0304+ supersymmetry led to the constraint (3.18) on the function R. For the sake of\nillustration, we now present a few examples of component form factors derived from\n(3.15).\nForm factor of Tr(\u03c6++ \u03c6++ )\n\n3.2.1\n\nOur first example is the form factor of Tr(\u03c6++ \u03c6++ ), which appears as the (\u03b8+ )0 -term\nin the expansion of T (x, \u03b8+ ) in (3.3). In this case, since\nZ\n+a \u03b1\nd4 \u03b8+ ei\u03b8\u03b1 \u03b3+a = (\u03b3+ )4 ,\n(3.21)\nwe need to extract the (\u03b3+ )4 component of (3.15).

In other words, the function R appearing in the\nT (x, \u03b8+ ) form factor can be calculated from the form factor of its lowest component6 Tr(\u03c6++ \u03c6++ )(0). Similar considerations apply to form factors of other half BPS\noperators such as Tr(\u03c6++ )n with n > 2.\n3.2.2\n\nForm factor of the on-shell Lagrangian\n\nAs a second important example, we now consider the form factor for the on-shell\nLagrangian, whose expression is [29]\ni\n\u221a\n1\n1 2 AB CD\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03b1A\nB\nL = Tr \u2212 F\u03b1\u03b2 F + 2g\u03bb [\u03c6AB , \u03bb\u03b1 ] \u2212 g [\u03c6 , \u03c6 ][\u03c6AB , \u03c6CD ] .\n2\n8\nh\n\n(3.25)\n\nNotice that it contains the self-dual part of Tr(F 2 ).

This allows us to make an interesting observation for the limit q \u2192 0 in\nwhich this form factor reduces simply to the correspond scattering amplitude. Actually, it turns out that any form factor with the on-shell Lagrangian L inserted reduces\nto the corresponding scattering amplitude in the q \u2192 0 limit, since the insertion of the\naction corresponds to differentiating the path-integral for the amplitude with respect\nto the coupling [42\u201344].\nAnother observation is that for the case of a gluonic state with MHV helicity\nconfiguration, (3.27) agrees with the Higgs plus multi-gluon or \"\u03c6-MHV\" amplitude\nconsidered in [45]. Indeed, if we have a gluonic state, we can effectively replace the\non-shell Lagrangian (3.25) with its first term, the square of the self-dual field strength.\n6\n\nOne could arrive at (3.24) in a much more straightforward way by noticing that T (x, \u03b8\u03b1+a ) =\n+a\n\u03b1\n+a\nexp(iPx) exp(iQ\u03b1\n+a \u03b8\u03b1 )T (0, 0) exp(\u2212iPx) exp(\u2212iQ+a \u03b8\u03b1 ) and using the invariance of the vacuum\nunder supersymmetry and translations.\n\n20\n\n\f3.2.3\n\nWhy is the maximally non-MHV form factor so simple?\n\nThe simplest tree-level form factor is the MHV form factor, e.g.\n2\nh1+ 2+ * * * i\u2212 * * * j \u2212 * * * (n \u2212 1)+ n+ | Tr(FSD\n)(0) |0i =\n\nhiji4\n.\nh12ih23i * * * hn 1i\n\n(3.28)\n\nInterestingly, there are non-MHV form factors whose expression is also remarkably\nsimple.

The non-supersymmetric versions of these methods\nhave been considered earlier in Section 2 and in [18].\nA preliminary observation is that the form factor of the complete stress-tensor\nmultiplet operator T (x, \u03b8+ , \u03b8\u0303\u2212 ) can be expressed in terms of that of its lowest bosonic\ncomponent Tr(\u03c6++ \u03c6++ ), as we have shown in (3.43), namely\n(4)\n\nF = \u03b4 (q \u2212\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\n\u03bbi \u03bb\u0303i ) \u03b4\n\n(4)\n\n\u03b3+ \u2212\n\nn\nX\n\n\u0001\n\n\u03b7+,i \u03bbi \u03b4\n\ni=1\n\n24\n\n(4)\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b3\u0303 \u2212\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\n\u0001\n\u03b7\u0303i\u2212 \u03bb\u0303i F\u03c6nc2 ,\n\n(4.1)\n\n\fwhere F\u03c6nc2 := h1 * * * n|Tr(\u03c6++ \u03c6++ )(0)|0i and the superstate h1 * * * n| is here in the\nnon-chiral representation. One can then switch instantly to the chiral representation\nvia a half-Fourier transform from the \u03b7\u0303 \u2212 to the \u03b7+ variables. Hence, we only need to\ndevise methods to calculate the form factor h1 * * * n|Tr(\u03c6++ \u03c6++ )(0)|0i using a chiral\nrepresentation for the external state. This is the problem we address in the following.9\n\n4.1\n\nSupersymmetric MHV rules\n\nWe begin with a lightning illustration of super MHV rules.

Form factors have a single operator\ninsertion, hence we only draw diagrams with a single form factor MHV vertex. As\nan example, consider the NMHV tree-level super form factor. It can be computed by\nsumming over all diagrams in Figure 5(a), whose expression is\nZ\nn i+n\u22122\nX\nX Z\n1\n(0)\n(0)\n(0)\n4\nFNMHV =\nd Pij d4 \u03b7P AMHV (i, .., j, Pij ) 2 FMHV (j +1, .., i\u22121, \u2212Pij ; q)\nPij\ni=1 j=i+1\n(0)\n\n= FMHV\n\nn i+n\u22122\nX\nX\ni=1 j=i+1\n\nj\n\n\u0011\n1 (4) \u0010 X\nhi\u22121 iihj j +1i\nA\n\u03b4\nhP\nki\u03b7\nij\nk .(4.3)\nhi\u22121 Pij ihPij iihj Pij ihPij j +1i Pij2\nk=i\n\nWe have also calculated tree-level N2 MHV super form factor up to six points and\nchecked that the results are all independent of the choice of reference spinor. We\nhave also re-derived the split-helicity form factors, and checked numerical agreement\nwith the results presented in Section 2.2.1.\nAs an additional example, consider the one-loop MHV super form factor.

Factorisation requires that each term in the recursion\nrelation must contain one form factor and one amplitude. Hence, for each kinematic\nchannel we need to sum over two diagrams, with the form factor appearing either on\nthe left-hand or right-hand side, see Figure 6.

Inspired by\nthese results, dual MHV rules directly formulated in dual momentum space were\nintroduced in [56]. In these rules a lightlike closed polygon formed by linking the\non-shell momenta of the external particles following their colour ordering plays an\nimportant role. Note that the same polygon appears in the amplitude/Wilson loop\nduality [32\u201334].\n27\n\n\fIn this section we extend these rules to the calculation of form factors of the special\noperator considered in previous sections, namely the chiral part of the stress-tensor\nmultiplet operator. It turns out that the rules for the amplitude have to be modified\nonly slightly. More precisely, there are no new vertices to be introduced, and we only\nhave to modify (super)momentum conservation of the particles in order to account\nfor the (super)momentum injected by the operator. In the dual momentum picture,\nthis implies the breaking of the closed null contour describing the particle's momenta.\nThe vertices of this open polygon in dual supermomentum space are labelled by\n(xi , \u0398i ) [57], with10\nxi \u2212 xi+1 := pi = \u03bbi \u03bb\u0303i ,\n\n\u0398i \u2212 \u0398i+1 := \u03bbi \u03b7i ,\n\n(5.1)\n\nwith\nxi \u2212 xi+n =\n\nn\nX\nj=1\n\npj = q ,\n\n\u0398i \u2212 \u0398i+n =\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03bbj \u03b7j = \u03b3 ,\n\n(5.2)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere q (\u03b3) is the (super)momentum carried by the operator. Note that in the\nprevious equation we have effectively injected the (super)momentum of the operator\nbetween on-shell states labelled by i \u2212 1 and i and this is where the breaking of\nthe polygon occurs. For each diagram an appropriate choice for the location of the\nbreaking will have to be made. Furthermore, in this section we consider the chiral\noperator T (x, \u03b8+ ) for which \u03b3\u2212 = 0, and hence \u0398i;\u2212 \u2212 \u0398i+n;\u2212 = 0. For amplitudes\nwe have of course q = 0 and \u03b3 = 0 which would bring us back to a closed lightlike\npolygon.\nIn practice it is useful to convert the open polygon for form factors into a periodic\nconfiguration in dual momentum space with period q (\u03b3) in the bosonic (fermionic)\ndirection as in Figure 8. This is partially motivated by a duality observed at strong\ncoupling in [15, 16] where form factors are related to the area of minimal surfaces\nending on an infinite periodic sequence of null segments at the boundary of AdS.\nIn [18] an attempt was made to map this geometric picture to weak coupling, in a\nway similar to the amplitude/Wilson loop duality [33, 34].\nThe emergence of a periodic configuration is also natural from a field-theoretic\npoint of view once one takes into account that the operator insertion is a colour\nsinglet, and hence does not interfere with the colour ordering of the external state. In\nother words, the (super)momentum carried by the operator can be inserted between\nany pair of particle momenta without spoiling the ordering. Precisely by resorting to\na periodic configuration we can account for this property, as Figure 8 clearly shows.\nOne can also consider this periodic kinematic configuration in momentum twistor\nspace [58], as shown in Figure 9, with space-time points being mapped to lines in\n10\n\nIn order to avoid confusion with the variables \u03b8's introduced in earlier sections, we denote by \u0398\nthe variables living in dual super momentum space.\n\n28\n\n\fq\nx5\n\nx3\nx2\n\np2\n\nx9\n\nx6\nx8\nq\n\np3\np1\nq\nx1\n\nx10\n\nx7\n\nx4\n\nFigure 8: The kinematic configuration in dual momentum space used to calculate\nthree-point form factors using dual MHV rules.\ntwistor space: (xi , \u0398i ) \u223c Zi\u22121 \u2227 Zi , where\nZi = (\u03bbi , \u03bdi , \u03c7i ) ,\n\n\u03bdi = xi \u03bbi = xi+1 \u03bbi ,\n\n\u03c7i = \u0398i \u03bbi = \u0398i+1 \u03bbi .\n\nZ8\n\nZ5\n\nZ2\nZ0\n\nZ9\n\nZ6\n\nZ3\n\nZ7\n\nZ4\n\nZ1\n\n(5.3)\n\nZ10\n\nFigure 9: The same kinematic configuration presented in Figure 8, in terms of momentum twistor space variables.\n\n5.1\n\nExamples\n\nIn this section we want to explain the dual MHV rules by discussing a number of\nsimple examples of tree-level and one-loop form factors. The dual MHV rules in dual\nmomentum space for N = 4 amplitudes are summarised for the reader's convenience\nin Appendix B, and we refer to [56] for full details.\nThe first example is that of an NMHV three-point form factor. The corresponding\ndiagrams are shown in Figure 10, and are in one-to-one correspondence with three\nconventional MHV diagrams, depicted in Figure 11. Notice that the three diagrams\nin Figure 10 can be obtained by selecting the appropriate period in Figure 8.\nx3\n\nx2\n\nx3\n\nx3\n\nx2\n\nq\n\nq\n\nx6\nx5\n\nx1\n\nq\n(a)\n\nx4\n\nx4\n(b)\n\nx5\nx4\n(c)\n\nFigure 10: Dual MHV diagrams for the three-point tree NMHV form factor.\n\n29\n\n\fx3\n\n2\n\nAMHV\n1\n\nFMHV\nx1\n\nq\n\n1\n\nx4\n\n3\n3\n\nAMHV\n\nFMHV\nx2\n\n2\n\n(a)\n\n1\nq\n\nx5\n\nAMHV\n3\n\n(b)\n\nFMHV\nx3\n\n2\nq\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 11: Corresponding MHV diagrams for the three-point tree NMHV form factor.\nThe extension to n-point NMHV form factors is immediate \u2013 we consider all\ndual MHV diagrams where one propagator connects two external vertices within one\nperiod. The final result is given by summing over all translationally inequivalent\ndiagrams as\nZ\nn i+n\u22121\nX\nX\nhi\u22121 ii\nhj \u22121 ji\n1\n(0)\n(0)\nFNMHV = FMHV\nd4 \u03b7ij \u03b4 0|8 (lij \u03b7ij +\u0398ij ) ,\n2\nhi\u22121\nl\nihl\nii\nhj\n\u22121\nl\nihl\nji\nx\nij\nij\nij\nij\nij\ni=1 j=i+2\n(5.4)\n\nwhere the spinor |lij i associated to the internal leg is defined as\n|lij i := |xij |\u03be] ,\n\n(5.5)\n\nand where |\u03be] is an arbitrary reference spinor. Notice that the particle labels of spinor\nvariables i and i + n are identified in this expression. Importantly, the fact that\nwe are calculating a form factor rather than an amplitude \u2013 and the corresponding\ndependence on q and \u03b3 \u2013 is completely encoded in the periodic kinematic configuration\nas defined earlier. Furthermore, we observe that every diagram in the sum corresponds\nto a particular period (see Figures 10 and 11).\nNotice that diagrams where a propagator connects two adjacent points give a\nvanishing result, and therefore are not included in the summation. On the other hand,\ndiagrams where a propagator connects two points separated by exactly one period\nor more are non-vanishing, and have to be excluded since there is no corresponding\nconventional MHV diagram. For instance, among the three-point diagrams in Figure\n10 we do not include the diagram with a propagator connecting points x1 and x4 . This\nis an example of a more general fact: diagrams where a single propagator connects\npoints xi and xj with |i \u2212 j| \u2265 n have to be discarded. This applies to any loop\norder. The reason for this rule is that there are no corresponding supersymmetric\nMHV diagrams.\nAs an aside we mention that (5.4) can also be written in terms of momentum\ntwistor variables as\n(0)\nFNMHV\n\n=\n\n(0)\nFMHV\n\nn i+n\u22121\nX\nX\n[\u2217, i\u22121, i, j \u22121, j] ,\n\n(5.6)\n\ni=1 j=i+2\n\nwhere Z\u2217 is the reference momentum twistor, chosen as\nZ\u2217 = (0, \u03be, 0) ,\n30\n\n(5.7)\n\n\fand [\u2217, i\u22121, i, j \u22121, j] is defined in (B.4).\n\nThe case of one-loop MHV form factors is similar to the tree-level NMHV case.\nThe n-point one-loop MHV form factor is given by\n(1)\nFMHV\n\nn i+n\u22121\nX\nX\n\nhi\u22121 ii\nhj \u22121 ji\n(5.8)\nhi\u22121 liI ihliI ii hj \u22121 lIj ihlIj ji\ni=1 j=i+1\nZ\nZ\n1\n1\n1\n4\n0|8\nd \u03b7iI \u03b4 (liI \u03b7iI + \u0398iI ) 2\nd4 \u03b7Ij \u03b4 0|8 (lIj \u03b7Ij + \u0398Ij )\nhliI lIj ihlIj liI i x2iI\nxIj\nZ\nn\nX\nhi\u22121 ii\n1\n(0)\n4\n8\n+ FMHV d xI d \u0398I\nhi\u22121 liI \u2032 ihliI \u2032 liI ihliI ii hliI li+nI ihli+nI liI i\ni=1\nZ\nZ\n1\n1\n4\n0|8\nd \u03b7iI \u03b4 (liI \u03b7iI + \u0398iI ) 2\nd4 \u03b7i+nI \u03b4 0|8 (li+nI \u03b7i+nI + \u0398i+nI )\nx2iI\nxi+nI\nZ\nd4 xI \u2032 d8 \u0398I \u2032 \u03b4 4 (xI \u2032 I \u2212 xii+n )\u03b4 0|8 (\u0398I \u2032 I \u2212 \u0398ii+n ) .\n=\n\nZ\n\n(0)\nFMHV\n\n4\n\n8\n\nd xI d \u0398I\n\nNotice that we have treated a special class of diagrams differently, corresponding to\nthe last three lines in (5.8). These are diagrams where the two propagators have\nmomenta xiI and xi+nI .

In\nthe dual MHV diagram there are two propagators with momenta x1I and x4I , and two\nvertices, x1 and xI . Such diagrams correspond to the last three lines of (5.8).\nThe three-point dual MHV diagrams at one loop are shown in Figure 13. The\ndiagrams in Figure 13 (g)-(i) are of the special class described earlier in Figure 12.\nNote that in the case of loop diagrams we also have to include diagrams where two\nadjacent points or two points separated by exactly one period are connected by two or\nmore propagators (see Figure 13 diagrams (a)-(c) and (g)-(i) respectively). We should\nalso stress that all diagrams where two points xi and xj with |i \u2212 j| > n are connected\nmust be discarded. Generalisations to non-MHV form factors are straightforward.\nFinally we compare the dual MHV diagrams with the periodic Wilson line diagrams studied in [18]. We can see that an identical truncation was necessary in order\nto obtain the correct result: in a single MHV diagram the external vertices which are\n31\n\n\fx3\n\nx2\n\nx3\n\nx3\n\nx2\n\nq\nx5\n\nxI\nx1\n\nx6\nx5\n\nxI\n\nx4\n\nq\n\nq\nxI\n\nx4\n\nx4\n(c)\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\nx3\n\nx2\n\nxI\n\nx3\n\nx3\n\nx2\n\nx6\nx5\n\nxI\n\nq\n\nq\nx5\n\nxI\n\nx1\n\nx4\n\nq\n\nx4\n\nx4\n(f )\n\n(e)\n\n(d)\nx3\n\nx2\n\nx2\n\nxI\n\nx3\n\nx3\nq\n\nq\n\nx6\n\nx5\n\nxI\n\nx5\n\nxI\n\nx1\nq\n\nx4\n\n(g)\n\nx4\n(h)\n\nx4\n(i)\n\nFigure 13: Dual MHV diagrams for the three-point MHV form factor at one loop.\nconnected to propagators must reside within one period, and the whole form factor\nis obtained by summing over all translationally inequivalent diagrams.\n\n5.2\n\nHigher-loop diagrams\n\nAt higher loops, the situation becomes more involved. To illustrate the main novelty\nwe consider the two-point MHV form factor at two loops.11\nAs prototypical examples, we consider two particular diagrams, depicted in Figures 14 and 15. In the first diagram, the form factor MHV vertex is inserted in the\nexterior part of the diagram, whereas in the second situation it is inserted in the\ninterior. On the right-hand side of each figure we also draw the corresponding dual\nMHV diagram. Let us start with the first, simpler situation. There is no subtlety in\ndefining the internal region momenta xI and xJ . The momenta in the propagators\nin the outer loop are x2I , x3J and x1J , and it is straightforward to write down the\ntwo-loop dual MHV integrand. In the notation of Appendix B, there are two internal\nvertices, two external vertices at x1 and x2 (with x1 being a two-point vertex) and\nfour propagators, as shown by dark bullets and dark wavy lines in Figure 14 (b).\nConsider now the second, more subtle situation drawn in Figure 15. In order to\nassign region momenta consistently to all regions in this diagram, we need to introduce\nan additional loop momentum xJ \u2032 such that xJ \u2212 xJ \u2032 = q, in exactly the same way as\n11\n\nIncidentally, we recall that while at one loop it has been proved that (four-dimensional) MHV\ndiagrams reproduce complete amplitudes [59], there is no such statement at two loops and beyond.\nHowever, MHV diagrams at two loops and beyond can be used effectively to compute unregulated\nintegrands of amplitudes (and form factors, as demonstrated here) which have recently attracted\ngreat interest in their own right [60].\n\n32\n\n\fx2\nx0\nxI\n\np1\nAMHV\nx1\n\nxJ\n\nx2\n\nx4\n\np2\nAMHV\n\nxI\n\nx1\n\nxI \u2032\n\nx3\n\nx3\n\nFMHV\n\nxJ\n\nxJ \u2032\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\nFigure 14: (a) First MHV diagram for a two-loop, two-point MHV form factor.

Each MHV diagram contributing to its\nexpansion is a product of MHV vertices, times propagators 1/L2 . These propagators\nwill either be independent of z, or vanish when z \u2192 \u221e. As in [23], the spinors\n \u0303 associated to internal legs can also be made z-independent by choosing the\n\u03bbL = L|\u03be]\nreference spinor \u03be \u0303 to be equal to \u03be \u0303 = \u03bb\u0303l . Thus, dangerous z-dependent terms can only\narise from terms affected by the shifts in the external legs k and l.\nFor the cases where (hk , hl ) is (\u00b1, +) or (0, +), only the denominators acquire\nz-dependence, and hence F (z) vanishes at large z. By using anti-MHV diagrams\nwe arrive at the same result for the case where (hk , hl ) is equal to either (\u2212, \u2212) or\n(\u2212, 0). The case (hk , hl ) = (0, 0) needs special attention. The case when k and l\nbelong to the same MHV vertex has already been considered, and leads to a falloff\nof the diagram as z \u2192 \u221e. When k and l belong to different vertices, there will be\nat least one propagator depending on z, which will provide a factor of 1/z at large\nz. The vertex involving leg l behaves asymptotically as z 2 /z 2 regardless of whether\nit is an MHV form factor or a conventional MHV vertex, while all other vertices are\nindependent of z. We conclude that each MHV diagram falls off as 1/z at large z.\nWe mention here that the argument described above can also been applied to\nscattering amplitudes. Shifting two scalars makes the amplitude vanish as z \u2192 \u221e\nprovided that the scalars take the same SU(4) indices.\n\n35\n\n\fA.2\n\nSupersymmetric form factors\n\nAs we have shown in the previous appendix, the bosonic form factor vanishes at infinity for an [i, ji shift if i and j are both scalars. Here we want to use supersymmetry\nto relate the large-z behaviour of generic supersymmetric form factors to that of form\nfactors with legs i and j being both scalars. This will then prove the validity of\nthe supersymmetric BCFW recursion relation for all supersymmetric form factors in\nfashion similar to [53].\nFor supersymmetric non-chiral form factor F (\u03bb, \u03bb\u0303, \u03b7+ , \u03b7\u0303 \u2212 ), the [i, ji shift is\n\u02c6\n\u03bb\u0303i (z) := \u03bb\u0303i + z \u03bb\u0303j ,\n\u03b7\u0302i,+ := \u03b7i,+ + z\u03b7j,+ ,\n\n\u03bb\u0302j := \u03bbj \u2212 z\u03bbi ,\n\u03b7\u0303\u02c6j\u2212 = \u03b7\u0303j\u2212 \u2212 z \u03b7\u0303i\u2212 .\n\n(A.3)\n\nAs in [53], we choose a particular transformation where\nQ\u03be = \u03be\u03b1\u2212 Q\u03b1\u2212 ,\n\nQ\u0304\u03b6\u0303 = \u03b6\u0303\u03b1\u0307+ Q\u0304\u03b1\u0307+ ,\n\n(A.4)\n\nwhere\n\u03b6\u0303 =\n\n\u0011\n1 \u0010\n\u2212 \u03bb\u0303i \u03b7j + \u03bb\u0303j \u03b7i ,\n[i j]\n\n\u03be=\n\n\u0011\n1 \u0010\n\u2212 \u03bbi \u03b7\u0303j + \u03bbj \u03b7\u0303i .\nhi ji\n\n(A.5)\n\nOne can check that their action on the fermionic coordinates \u03b7k,+ , \u03b7\u0303k\u2212 is\n[ki]\n[kj]\n+ \u03b7j,+\n,\n[ij]\n[ij]\nhkii\nhkji\n+ \u03b7\u0303j\u2212\n,\n= \u03b7\u0303k\u2212 \u2212 \u03b7\u0303i\u2212\nhiji\nhiji\n\n\u2032\neQ\u0304\u03b6\u0303 \u03b7k,+ := \u03b7k,+\n= \u03b7k,+ \u2212 \u03b7i,+\n\neQ\u03be \u03b7\u0303k\u2212 := \u03b7\u0303k\u2032\u2212\n\n(A.6)\n(A.7)\n\nand in particular eQ\u0304\u03b6\u0303 \u03b7i,+ = eQ\u0304\u03b6\u0303 \u03b7j,+ = eQ\u03be \u03b7\u0303i\u2212 = eQ\u03be \u03b7\u0303j\u2212 = 0. Since the form factor is\ninvariant under Q\u0304+ and Q\u2212 transformations, i.e. eQ\u0304\u03b6\u0303 F = eQ\u03be F = F (see (3.41)), we\nconclude that\n\u02c6\nF (\u03bb1 , \u03bb\u03031 , \u03b71,+ , \u03b7\u03031\u2212 ; * * * ; \u03bbi , \u03bb\u0303i , \u03b7\u0302i,+ , \u03b7\u0303i\u2212 ; * * * ; \u03bb\u0302j , \u03bb\u0303j , \u03b7j,+ , \u03b7\u0303\u02c6j\u2212 ; * * * ; \u03bbn , \u03bb\u0303n , \u03b7n,+ , \u03b7\u0303n\u2212 )\n\u02c6\n\u2032\n\u2032\n, \u03b7\u0303n\u2032\u2212 ) . (A.8)\n= F (\u03bb1 , \u03bb\u03031 , \u03b71,+\n, \u03b7\u03031\u2032\u2212 ; * * * ; \u03bbi , \u03bb\u0303i , 0, 0; * * * ; \u03bb\u0302j , \u03bb\u0303j , 0, 0; * * * ; \u03bbn , \u03bb\u0303n , \u03b7n,+\nThus, we can always choose a supersymmetry transformation which sets i and j to\n\u2032\nbe scalars. It is important to notice that under the [i, ji shift, the transformed \u03b7+\nand \u03b7\u0303 \u2032\u2212 variables are independent of z. The large-z behaviour of F (z) is therefore\nthe same as that of the bosonic form factor with i and j being scalars. This case was\nconsidered in the previous appendix, and shown to fall off as 1/z at large z. Hence the\nstatement is also true for the shifted supersymmetric form factor F (z). The proof\nillustrated above concerned the large-z behaviour of the full non-chiral super form\nfactor, but a very similar one applies to the form factor in chiral superspace, since\nthe latter is related to the former by a half-Fourier transform in superspace.\n36\n\n\fB\n\nDual MHV rules\n\nWe recall that momenta and supermomenta for a massless particle are defined in\nterms of dual momenta and supermomenta as [57]\nxi \u2212 xi+1 = \u03bbi \u03bb\u0303i ,\n\n\u0398i \u2212 \u0398i+1 = \u03bbi \u03b7i ,\n\n(B.1)\n\nwhere xij := xi \u2212 xj and \u0398ij := \u0398i \u2212 \u0398j .\n\nThe dual MHV diagram rules of [56] are summarised in Figure 17.\n(a)\n\n1 R\nx2ij\n\nj\n\ni\n\ni2\n\ni3\n\nI\n\nR\n\n2\ngYM\nd4 xI d8\u0398I hl\n\n(b)\ni1\n\n1\nIi1 lIi2 ihlIi2 lIi3 i***hlIir\u22121 lIir ihlIir lIi1 i\n\nir\ni+1\n\n(c)\n\nd4\u03b7ij \u03b4 0|8(lij \u03b7ij + \u0398ij )\n\njr\n\ni\n\nj2\n\nhi\u22121 ii\nhi\u22121 lij1 ihlij1 lij2 ihlij2 lij3 i***hlijr\u22121 lijr ihlijr ii\n\nj1\ni\u22121\n\nFigure 17: Feynman rules for dual MHV diagrams.
