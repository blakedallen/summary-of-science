INTRODUCTION\n\nDi\u00aeusion-limited aggregation (DLA) [1] and other related models [2,3] have become paradigms for growth phenomena in far from equilibrium conditions [4]. In colloidal suspensions\nand other systems well described by these models [5], the elementary units that successively\nstick to form the aggregate remain thereafter at relative  \u0304xed positions, thus conferring\nan intrinsic rigidity to the structure: the statistical properties characterizing the disorder\nof the particle positions are quenched by the growth process itself. This is an important\nlimitation that precludes application of di\u00aeusion-limited models to many aggregating systems, like the ones involving rearrangement within the clusters [6] or systems of polymer\nchains in solution [7], that consist of elements of a \u00b0uctuating nature. A realistic model\nfor describing growth in this class of systems must include information not only about the\ncolliding events that lead to the irreversible build up of the structure, but also about the\nequilibrium con \u0304gurations that result from the brownian motion of the internally articulated constituents. Clearly, the statistical properties characterizing the positional disorder\nare here a combination of quenched and annelead processes but more crucially, the consecutive attachments of the incoming di\u00aeusive particles will now be biased by the \u00b0uctuations\nof the existing aggregate. In this letter we report numerical results on a model for di\u00aeusionlimited aggregation where, at the opposite of conventional DLA, the constituents remain\nfreely articulated during and after the growing process.\n\nII. CONSTRUCTION OF A FLUCTUATING DLA\n\nWe build a \u00b0uctuating DLA (FDLA) aggregate from spherical monomers as sketched\nin Fig. 1. The growth process starts from a seed particle of size r0 placed at the origin.\nSuccessive identical particles are attached to the aggregate in the following way: a monomer\nis released from a random point on a spherical shell that completely surrounds the aggregate.\nThis monomer is allowed to move randomly while some of the monomers of the aggregate,\n\n2\n\n\fchosen at random, are also allowed to move in random directions in steps of size j\u00b1rj. If the\ndistance between the released particle and any of the particles of the aggregate happens to\nbe less than r0 then the released particle sticks to that other particle at the contact point and\na new one is released. If the particle moves to a distance too far away from the aggregate,\nthis particle is \\killed\" and a new particle is released. In order to accelerate the simulation\nwe used step size control. When the particle was at a distance d to the cluster, a step of\nsize \u00b1 = max(d \u00a1 5r0 ; 0:2r0 ) was used. This value of the step size allows a rapid approach\nof the particle to the aggregate without hindering large excursions. Once attached to each\nother, the monomers interact through the conventional  \u0304nitely extensible nonlinear elastic\n(FENE) potential [8], often used in polymer simulations:\n*\n\n \u0327\n\n3 r \u00a1 r  \u03012\nk\nij\n0\nVb (rij ) = \u00a1 (rsup \u00a1 r0 )2 ln 1 \u00a1\n;\n2\nrsup \u00a1 r0\n\n(1)\n\nwhere k is the spring constant, and rij , r0 , and rsup are the instantaneous length of bond\nij, the equilibrium bond length (or equivalently, the particle size), and the maximum bond\nlength, respectively. The interaction between monomers not directly connected by a spring,\nis given by a hard sphere potential Vnb (rij ) = 1; if rij * r0 ; Vnb (rij ) = 0; if rij > r0 where\nrij is the instantaneous distance between particles i and j. These potentials are used to\naccept or reject the movement of the internal monomers according to a standard Metropolis\nalgorithm [9]. For the results presented in this letter each of the monomers of the aggregate\nmoves on average once at each step of the incoming particle. In order to ensure that a\nfull grown aggregate relaxes towards its equilibrium states, a non biased Montecarlo scheme\nis run at the end of the growth process. In all simulations, the system is held at  \u0304xed\ntemperature T = 1=kB , where kB is the Boltzman constant. The parameters used in the\nsimulations for the FENE potential were: k = 50, r0 = 1, and rsup = 1:2r0 to avoid bond\ncrossing. The releasing sphere had size rmax + rsup , where rmax is the farthest distance\nbetween the origin and the monomers of the cluster, and the \\killing\" sphere had size 2rmax .\nThe size of the steps of the internal monomers was j\u00b1rj (\u00b1r\u00ae * 0:2r0 , \u00ae = x; y; z). A typical\nsnapshot of the aggregate is shown in Fig. 2. The number of MC steps used to relax the\n3\n\n\faggregate was of the order of 109 .\n\nIII. RESULTS\n\nWe extracted pair correlation functions for the aggregates by the usual histogram\nmethod [10]. From a randomly chosen monomer, the distances r to all other monomers\nare calculated and the histogram N(r; \u00a2) of the distance distribution is obtained by counting the number of distances in the interval (r; r + \u00a2). The histogram is further averaged\nfor all the monomers of the aggregate and for a number of di\u00aeerent runs. The pair correlation function was then obtained as g(r) = N (r; r + \u00a2)=(41\u20444r2 \u00a2) and  \u0304tted to the stretched\nexponential form g(r) = Ardf \u00a13 expf\u00a1(r=\u00bb)a g; where df is the fractal dimension and \u00bb a\ndecaying length associated with the size of the aggregate [11]. The exponent a is larger than\nunity and A is related to the total mass. A typical  \u0304t is shown in the inset of Fig. 3. In\nthis  \u0304gure, the variation of df as a function of the total mass N of the aggregate is shown\nfor N = 1000, 2000 and 3000. The fractal dimension was obtained from pair-correlation\nfunctions thermodynamically averaged for  \u0304ve di\u00aeerent aggregates. It represents therefore a\nmixture of quenched and annealed averages, related respectively to the di\u00aeerent connectivities of the aggregates and to the statistical thermodynamic conformations brought about\nby the brownian motion. Although aggregates larger than N = 3000 can be built in a reasonable computation time, the growth process with internal mobility leads to an aggregate\nthat must still further relax in the bath { compare open to solid squares in Fig. 3. It is such\ntime consuming after-growth relaxation process that puts an upper bound to the sizes we\nconsidered in this study.\nThe fractal dimension of the aggregate grows with the total particle number, as shown\nin Fig. 3. This is a familiar feature of DLA growth, as also shown in the  \u0304gure, where\nthe fractal dimensions of regular DLA is shown for comparison [12]. The pair-correlation\nfunctions were obtained in this case by averaging only over the quenched, topological disorder associated with the di\u00aeerent connectivities of  \u0304ve di\u00aeerent aggregates. For these, a\n4\n\n\freasonable asymptotic value is reached for N  \u0327 3000. For the FDLA values, the data does\nnot show yet at N = 3000 a tendency to saturate indicating a probable asymptotic value at\ndf  \u0327 2:53. Although one should bear in mind the relatively large error bars (\u00a2df =df \u00bb 5%)\npresent in the determination of the fractal dimensions, our data show that the e\u00aeect of\nthe allowed internal mobility is to generate aggregates with higher fractal dimension than\nthe ones generated by conventional DLA. Further con \u0304rmation that compacter objects are\nformed by this growth method can be seen from the Fourier transform of the pair correlation\nfunction, the so-called structure factor de \u0304ned by\n1\nS(q) =\nN\n\n\u00bf X\nN\n\nn;m=1\n\n\u00c0\n\nexp fiq \u00a2 ( rn \u00a1 rm )g ;\n\n(2)\n\nwhere N is the number of scattering units in the aggregate, ri is the position of the i-th\nscattering unit, q is the wavevector and the quenched and annealed averages are denoted\nby h:::i. Fig. 4 shows the structure factors of objects with N = 2000. They exhibit the\ncharacteristic shape of DLA structure factors, also similar to the scattering functions of\nstar-like polymers and dendrimers and other computer-generated aggregates [13]. An initial\nlow wavevector plateau is followed by a hump that crosses at higher wavevectors into a\nlinear region of slope close to \u00a11:8. The extension of the plateau is a measure of the\n2\nsize of the object, more precisely of its radius of gyration [14], S(q ! 0) \u00bb 1 \u00a1 q 2 RG\n=3\n2\n= 1=N h\nwith RG\n\nPN\n\nn;m=1 (\n\nd\n\nrn \u00a1 rm )2 i. From this measure the fractal dimension can also be\n\nextracted N \u00bb RGf . Graphically this implies that the fractal dimension can be obtained\nby the slope of the envelope of the humps of a series of structure factor curves of di\u00aeerent\nmasses. It is clear from Fig. 4 that the radius of gyration of a FDLA structure is smaller than\nthe corresponding DLA quantity. The total mass of the FDLA structure is thus distributed\nover a smaller region, consistent with a denser object of higher fractal dimension. The\nlocal structure of the monomer correlations determines the high wavevector region of the\nscattering curves. Here, a self similar structure of dimension \u00bb 1:8 gives rise to the linear\nregion of the curves shown in Fig. 4. Note also that this local structure is known to have a\nsimilar fractal dimension as that of di\u00aeusion-limited cluster aggregates (DLCA) [11].\n5\n\n\fIV. DISCUSSION\n\nTwo e\u00aeects might be at the origin of the increased compactness of the FDLA structure.\nOne, related to its internal \u00b0exibility, can be better understood by considering  \u0304rst a directed\ngrowth process. Without internal mobility, that would lead to a rod-like object, with fractal\ndimension df = 1. Bringing mobility to this object would obviously transform it into a\nself-avoiding walk (SAW), with fractal dimension df ' 1:7, much larger than the original\none. The SAW fractal dimension is the result of a compromise between excluded volume\ninteractions that resist compaction, and conformational entropy that resists stretching [15].\nIf a linear growth process would prepare a quenched distribution of chains statistically\nstretched with respect to the SAW equilibrium distribution, the further introduction of\ninternal degrees of freedom would anneal the distribution, leading to an increase of the\nfractal dimension. In order to see if this mechanism is at work for DLA structures, we  \u0304rst\nprepared conventional DLA aggregates of N = 1000, 2000 and 3000, then allowed them\nto thermodynamically relax under 109 Monte-Carlo steps. Comparing the open and solid\ncircles in Fig. 3 one sees that relaxation leads systematically to an increase of the fractal\ndimension. This means that the conventional DLA growth process does prepare quenched\nbut statistically stretched structures. Further con \u0304rmation of this e\u00aeect is provided in Fig. 5\nwhere the average distance r of a given monomer to the position of the seed monomer is\nshown as a function of the chemical distance n between them. The chemical distance n\nis de \u0304ned as the number of elements connecting these two points. The slope of this curve\nis related to chain stretching along that chemical path [16]. As the  \u0304gure shows, thermal\nrelaxation is followed by a levelling of the curve close to the extremities of that particular\nbranch, whereas the internal monomers retain their original stretching. This is a known steric\ne\u00aeect also present in polymer brushes [17] or star polymers [18]. Close to the center, where\nthe monomer density is higher, excluded volume interactions stretch branches outwards from\ntheir central attachment point. On the contrary, there is no force acting on the free ends\nof the branches. Chain stretching decreases therefore from its maximum at the center to a\n6\n\n\fvanishing value at the free-end. It appears however that such mechanism is not su\u00b1cient to\nexplain alone the observed compaction under FDLA growth, because, as shown in Fig. 3,\nthe thermal relaxation of the conventional DLA stops short of the higher values obtained\nfor FDLA.\nA second e\u00aeect that is likely to be at work compacting the  \u0304nal FDLA object, is related\nto its branch structure. Indeed, an incoming particle has a higher probability to stick  \u0304rst\nto an outer branch of the aggregate, than to penetrate deep, close to the seed monomer [1].\nAn useful indicator of the branch structure is provided by the average number of monomers\nat a chemical distance n from the seed monomer. A monodisperse star, for instance, would\nhave an uniform distribution with an upper cut-o\u00ae corresponding to the arm length. A\nconventional DLA aggregate has a bell distribution. For the DLA aggregate of 2000 particles\nshown in Fig. 6 the maximum of the distribution corresponds to monomers separated from\nthe seed by approximately 28 other monomers. The FDLA distribution shows that branches\nare shorter on average, the maximum being at approximately 20 monomers. The higher\nfractal dimension of FDLA is thus not only due to its internal \u00b0exibility but also to a\ndi\u00aeerent branching structure of the aggregate. Interestingly, the amount of free ends is\nquite constant during the growth process of both DLA and FDLA aggregates, at about\n31%. This indicates that out of three new incoming monomers one contributes to a new\nbranch being created, and the other two stick to existing free ends. This in turn implies that\nthe more compact branch structure of FDLA is due to a deeper penetration of the incoming\nmonomers.\n\nV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nAs a summary, we have shown that di\u00aeusion limited aggregation with soft particles that\nallow to internal mobility of the growing aggregate leads to more compact structures of higher\nfractal dimension. The increase compactness of the structure is due both to the internal\nrelaxation of the growth structure but also to an increased compactness of its connectivity\n7\n\n\ftree. We hope to extend in the near future our studies to larger aggregates: it remains yet\nto be shown if a well de \u0304ned fractal dimension can be asymptotically reached.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was supported by the Chemistry Department of the CNRS, under AIP \\Soutien aux Jeunes Equipes\".
