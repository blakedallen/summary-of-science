There are various approaches in this sphere.\nFor instance, the use of a quantum-dot setup8,9 has been proposed, which can be operated either as a spin filter to produce spin-polarized currents or as a device to detect and manipulate spin states. Spintronics in graphene has also been\nproposed10,11,12 recently. In the following we address this issue in a new type of materials, graphene nanodisks.13,14,15,16,17\nGraphene nanostructure18,19,20 such as graphene\nnanoribbons21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30\nand\ngraphene\nnanodisks13,14,15,16,17 could be basic components of future nanoelectronic and spintronic devices.\nGraphene\nnanodisks are nanometer-scale disk-like materials which have\nclosed edges. They are constructed by connecting several\nbenzenes, some of which have already been manufactured\nby soft-landing mass spectrometry.27,31,32 There are varieties\nof nanodisks, among which zigzag trigonal nanodisks with\nsize N are prominent because they have N -fold degenerated\nzero-energy states. We have already shown14 that spins make\na ferromagnetic order and that the relaxation time is finite\nbut quite large even if the size N is very small. We refer to\nthis property as quasi-ferromagnet. Furthermore we have\nargued17 that a nanodisk behaves as if it were a quantum dot\nwith an internal degree of freedom, where the conductance\nexhibits a peculiar series of Coulomb blockade peaks.\nIn this paper we make an investigation of the spin current\nin the zero-energy sector of the trigonal zigzag nanodisk. We\nfirst analyze how the spin of a nanodisk filters the spin of\nthe current by assuming that the nanodisk is a rigid ferromagnet. The fact that the direct and exchange Coulomb interactions are of the same of magnitude plays an important\nrole. However the nanodisk is not a rigid ferromagnet but a\nquasi-ferromagnet. Hence an intriguing reaction phenomenon\noccurs: Namely, the spin of the nanodisk can be controlled\nby the spin of the current. Using these properties we propose\nsome applications for spintronic devices, such as spin mem-\n\nory, spin amplifier, spin valve, spin-field-effect transistor and\nspin diode.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec.II, we summarize\nthe basic notion of the nanodisk. The low-energy physics is\ndescribed by electrons in the N -fold degenerated zero-energy\nsector, which form a quasi-ferromagnet due to a large exchange interaction. In Sec.III, we investigate the spin-filter\neffects based on the master equation. In Sec.IV, we analyze\nthe reaction to the spin of the nanodisk from the spin of electrons in the current. We discuss the relaxation process using\nthe Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. In Sec.V, we propose\nvarious spintronic devices and explore their properties.\n\nII. NANODISK QUASI-FERROMAGNETS\nA. Zero-Energy Sector\n\nGraphene nanodisks are graphene derivatives which have\nclosed edges. The Hamiltonian is defined by\nX\nX \u2020\ntij c\u2020i cj ,\n(2.1)\n\u03b5 i ci ci +\nH=\ni\n\nhi,ji\n\nwhere \u03b5i is the site energy, tij is the transfer energy, and c\u2020i\nis the creation operator of the \u03c0 electron at the site i. The\nsummation is taken over all nearest neighboring sites hi, ji.\nOwing to their homogeneous geometrical configuration, we\nmay take constant values for these energies, \u03b5i = \u03b5F and tij =\nt \u2248 2.70eV.\nWe have searched for zero-energy states or equivalently\nmetallic states in graphene nanodisks with various sizes and\nshapes.14 The emergence of zero-energy states is surprisingly\nrare. Among typical nanodisks, only trigonal zigzag nanodisks have degenerate zero-energy states and show metallic\nferromagnetism, where the degeneracy can be controlled arbitrarily by designing the size.\nTrigonal zigzag nanodisks are specified by the size parameter N as in Fig.1(a). The size-N nanodisk has N -fold degenerated zero-energy states,14 where the gap energy is as large as\na few eV. Hence it is a good approximation to investigate the\n\n\f2\nelectron-electron interaction physics only in the zero-energy\nsector, by projecting the system to the subspace made of those\nzero-energy states. The zero-energy sector consists of N orthonormal states |f\u03b1 i, \u03b1 = 1, 2, * * * , N , together with the\nSU(N) symmetry. We can expand the wave function of the\nstate |f\u03b1 i,\nX\n\u03c9i\u03b1 \u03c6i (x),\n(2.2)\nf\u03b1 (x) =\ni\n\nin terms of the Wannier function \u03c6i (x) localized at the site i.\nThe amplitude \u03c9i\u03b1 is calculable by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian (2.1).\n\nFIG. 1: (a) Trigonal zigzag nanodisks. The size parameter N is\ndefined in this way. The number of carbon atoms is given by\nNC = N 2 + 6N + 6. (b) The nanodisk-lead system. The nanodisk\nwith N = 7 is connected to the right and left leads by tunneling\ncoupling tR and tL . The chemical potential is \u03bcR or \u03bcL at each lead.\n\nB. Quasi-Ferromagnets\n\nWe include the Coulomb interaction between electrons in\nthe zero-energy sector.17 It is straightforward to rewrite the\nCoulomb Hamiltonian as\nX\nHDeff =\nU\u03b1\u03b2 n (\u03b1) n (\u03b2)\n\u03b1\u2265\u03b2\n\n1X\n\u2212\nJ\u03b1\u03b2 [4S(\u03b1) * S(\u03b2) + n (\u03b1) n (\u03b2)],\n2\n\n(2.3)\n\n\u03b1>\u03b2\n\nwhere U\u03b1\u03b2 and J\u03b1\u03b2 are the Coulomb energy and the exchange\nenergy between electrons in the states |f\u03b1 i and |f\u03b2 i. Here,\nn (\u03b1) is the number operator and S(\u03b1) is the spin operator,\nn (\u03b1) = d\u2020\u03c3 (\u03b1)d\u03c3 (\u03b1),\n(2.4a)\n1\n(2.4b)\nS(\u03b1) = d\u2020\u03c3 (\u03b1)\u03c4 \u03c3\u03c3\u2032 d\u03c3\u2032 (\u03b1),\n2\nwith d\u03c3 (\u03b1) the annihilation operator of electron with spin\n\u03c3 =\u2191, \u2193 in the state |f\u03b1 i: \u03c4 is the Pauli matrix.\nThe remarkable feature is that there exists a large overlap\nbetween the wave functions f\u03b1 (x) and f\u03b2 (x), \u03b1 6= \u03b2, since\nthe state |f\u03b1 i is an ensemble of sites as in (2.2) and identical\nsites are included in |f\u03b1 i and |f\u03b2 i. Consequently, the dominant contributions come from the on-site Coulomb terms not\nonly for the Coulomb energy but also for the exchange energy:\nIndeed, it follows that U\u03b1\u03b2 = J\u03b1\u03b2 in the on-site approximation. We thus obtain\nX\n(2.5)\n(\u03c9i\u03b1 \u03c9i\u03b2 )2 ,\nU\u03b1\u03b2 \u2243 J\u03b1\u03b2 \u2243 U\ni\n\nwhere\nU\u2261\n\nXZ\n\nd3 xd3 y \u03c6\u2217i (x)\u03c6i (x)V (x\u2212y)\u03c6\u2217j (y)\u03c6j (y) (2.6)\n\ni,j\n\nwith the Coulomb potential V (x \u2212 y). The Coulomb energy\nU is of the order of 1eV because the lattice spacing of the\ncarbon atoms is \u223c 1\u00c5 in graphene.\nSince the exchange energy J\u03b1\u03b2 is as large as the Coulomb\nenergy U\u03b1\u03b2 , the spin stiffness J\u03b1\u03b2 is quite large. Furthermore,\nwe have checked17 numerically that all J\u03b1\u03b2 are of the same\norder of magnitude for any pair of \u03b1 and \u03b2, implying that the\nSU(N) symmetry is broken but not so strongly in the Hamiltonian (2.3). It is a good approximation to start with the exact\nSU(N ) symmetry. Then, the zero-energy sector is described\nby the SU(N) Heisenberg-Hubbard model,\nX\nHD = \u2212 J\nS (\u03b1) * S (\u03b2)\n+\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b16=\u03b2\n\nU\nJ\n\u2212\n2\n4\n\n\u0013X\n\nn (\u03b1) n (\u03b2) + U\n\nX\n\nn (\u03b1) , (2.7)\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b16=\u03b2\n\nwith J \u2248 U . We rewrite HD as\n\"\n# \u0012\n\u0013\nX\nJ\nU\n2\n2\nn2tot\n\u2212\nHD = \u2212 J Stot \u2212\nS (\u03b1) +\n2\n4\n\u03b1\n\u0013\n\u0012\nJ X\nU\nn (\u03b1)\n+\n+\n2\n4\n\u03b1\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nU\nU\nJ\n2\n= \u2212 JStot\n+\nn2tot +\n\u2212\n+ J ntot\n2\n4\n2\n\n(2.8)\n\nin terms of the total spin,\nS tot =\n\nX\n\nS (\u03b1) ,\n\n(2.9)\n\nand the total electron number,\nX\nntot =\nn (\u03b1) .\n\n(2.10)\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\nAt the half-filling, the eigenstate of the Hamiltonian HD\nis labeled as |si = |ntot , l, mi, where l is the total spinangular momentum and m is its z-component. Based on this\nHamiltonian we have shown14 that the relaxation time of the\nferromagnetic-like spin polarization is quite large even if the\nsize of trigonal zigzag nanodisks is quite small. Such a nanodisk may be called a quasi-ferromagnet. We refer to the total\nspin S tot of a nanodisk as the nanodisk spin.\nC. Nanodisk-Lead System\n\nWe consider a system made of a nanodisk connected by two\nmetallic leads [Fig.1(b)]. The model Hamiltonian is given by\nH = HL + HTL + HTR + HD ,\n\n(2.11)\n\n\f3\nwhere HD is the Hamiltonian (2.7) of a nanodisk, and HL is\nthe lead Hamiltonian\n\u0010\n\u0011\nX\nR\u2020 R\nL\nHL =\n\u03b5 (k) cL\u2020\n(2.12)\nk\u03c3 ck\u03c3 + ck\u03c3 ck\u03c3 .\nk\u03c3\n\nThe Hamiltonian HL describes a noninteracting electron gas\nin the leads with \u03b5 (k) = ~2 k2 /2m, while HTL and HTR are\nthe transfer Hamiltonian between the left (L) and right (R)\nleads and the nanodisk, respectively,\n\u0011\nX X \u0010 L\u2020\nHTL =tL\n(2.13a)\nck\u03c3 d\u03c3 (\u03b1) + d\u2020\u03c3 (\u03b1)cLk\u03c3 ,\nk\u03c3\n\nHTR\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u0011\nX X \u0010 R\u2020\n=tR\nck\u03c3 d\u03c3 (\u03b1) + d\u2020\u03c3 (\u03b1)cRk\u03c3 ,\nk\u03c3\n\n\u03b1\n\nIII. SPIN FILTER\n\nThe aim of this paper is to investigate a nanodisk as a spin\nfilter38 based on the Hamiltonian (2.11). The setup we consider is a lead-nanodisk-lead system [Fig.1(b)], where an electron makes a tunnelling from the left lead to the nanodisk and\nthen to the right lead. We investigate how the electron spin is\naffected by the nanodisk spin during the transport process.\nThe dynamics of the nanodisk system is described by the\nmaster equation,\n\u2202\u03c1 (s) X\n=\n[W (s, s\u2032 ) \u03c1 (s\u2032 ) \u2212 W (s\u2032 , s) \u03c1 (s)] , (3.1)\n\u2202t\n\u2032\ns\n\nwhere \u03c1 (s) represents the probability to find the system in the\nstate |si = |ntot , l, mi, and W (s\u2032 , s) is the transition rate between the states |si and |s\u2032 i. The master equation describes\na stochastic evolution in the space spanned by the states |si.\nJumps between different states are assumed to be Markovian.\nThe stationary solution is given by the detailed balance condition \u2202\u03c1/\u2202t = 0.\n2\nSince the Hamiltonian HD only depends on Stot\n, the probability \u03c1(s) has no dependence on the spin component m. Then\nit is convenient to do a sum over m,\nX\n\u03c1 (s) =\n\u03c1 (s)\n(3.2)\nm\n\nwith |si = |ntot , li. The master equation is rewritten as\n\u2202\u03c1 (s)\n=\n\u2202t\n\ns\u2032\n\n[W (s, s\u2032 ) \u03c1 (s\u2032 ) \u2212 W (s\u2032 , s) \u03c1 (s)] .\n\nW\u03c7 (s\u2032 , s) =\u0393\u03c7 f\u03c7 (\u2206s\u2032 s ) \u03b4n\u2032 ,n+1\n+ \u0393\u03c7 [1 \u2212 f\u03c7 (\u2206s\u2032 s )] \u03b4n\u2032 ,n\u22121 .\nf\u03c7 (\u03b5) = {1 + exp [(\u03b5 \u2212 \u03bc\u03c7 ) /kB T ]}\n\n\u22121\n\n(3.5)\n\nis the Fermi function at temperature T , with \u03bc\u03c7 the chemical\npotential at the right or left lead, \u03c7 =R,L. We set\n\u03bcL = \u03bc + \u2206\u03bc,\n\n\u03bcR = \u03bc \u2212 \u2206\u03bc.\n\n(3.6)\n\nSecond, \u2206s\u2032 s is the energy difference between the two states\n|s\u2032 i and |si,\n\u2206s\u2032 s = Es\u2032 \u2212 Es .\n\n(3.7)\n\nThird,\n\u0393\u03c7 = 2\u03c0\u03bd A\u03c3\u03c7,ss\u2032\n\n2\n\n(3.8)\n\nis\nPthe tunneling rate through the right or left lead, where \u03bd =\nk \u03b4 (\u03b5F \u2212 \u03b5k ) is the density of states at the Fermi level \u03b5F in\nthe leads, which is a constant, and\nX\nA\u03c3\u03c7,ss\u2032 = t\u03c7\nhs\u2032 | d\u03b1\u03c3 |si .\n(3.9)\n\u03b1\n\nIt follows that the tunneling rate \u0393\u03c7 is a constant for the states\n|si and |s\u2032 i connected by a Markov step, and zero otherwise.\nThe current through the nanodisk can be written as\nX\nI\u03c3 =\n[WR (s\u2032 , s) \u03c1 (s) \u2212 WR (s, s\u2032 ) \u03c1 (s\u2032 )] ,\n(3.10)\ns,s\u2032\n\nP\n\n\u2032\nwhere\ns,s\u2032 runs over the states |si and |s i such that\n\u2032\nhs | d\u03b1\u03c3 |si =\n6 0. Thus the current I\u03c3 depend on the spin configuration of electrons in the nanodisk.\nWe have argued that the nanodisk is a quasi-ferromagnet.\nFor the sake of simplicity, we start with the simplification\nthat the ground state is a ferromagnet with polarized up-spins.\nWhen the transition interaction is small enough, a single electron tunnels at once, namely, the electron number in the nanodisk increases or decreases by one, n\u2032tot = ntot \u00b1 1. First\nof all, we notice that, when n\u2032tot = ntot + 1, the tunneling of\nspin-up electrons is blocked by the Pauli's exclusion principle.\nThe Markov chain of spin configurations contain only a finite\nnumber of states. For instance it is 9 in the case of N = 5\nnanodisk. We number them as indicated in Fig.2.\nWe calculate the energy Es of various states |si = |ntot , li\nin this chain. According to the above numbering convention\n(Fig.2), they are\n\nE1 =EN,N/2 ,\n(3.3)\n\n(3.4)\n\nLet us explain notations. First,\n\n(2.13b)\n\nwith t\u03c7 the tunneling coupling constant: We have assumed\nthat the spin does not flip in the tunneling process.\nThe nanodisk-lead system looks similar to that of the N -dot\nsystem.33 However, there exists a crucial difference. On one\nhand, in the ordinary N -dot system, an electron hops from one\ndot to another dot. On the other hand, in our nanodisk system,\nthe index \u03b1 of the Hamiltonian runs over the N -fold degenerate states and not over the sites. According to the Hamiltonian (2.13), an electron does not hop from one state to another\nstate. Hence, it is more appropriate to regard our nanodisk as\na one-dot system with an internal degree of freedom.\n\nX\n\nIn the following we denote \u03c1 (s) as \u03c1 (s) for simplicity.\nIn this paper we consider the small coupling limit, t\u03c7 \u226a\nJ, \u03c7 =L, R, where the dominant process is the sequential\ntunneling: It is of the order of |t\u03c7 |2 , while the cotunneling\n4\nprocess of the order of |t\u03c7 | .\nIn the sequential-tunneling regime the transition rate, W =\nWL + WR , is obtained by the Fermi's golden rule,8,34,35\n\nE2 = EN \u22121,(N \u22121)/2 ,\n\nE4 =EN \u22121,(N \u22123)/2 ,\n\nE3 = EN,N/2\u22121 ,\n\nE5 = EN +1,(N \u22121)/2 ,\n\n*** .\n\n(3.11)\n\n\f4\nwhere\nI0 =\n\ne\u0393L \u0393R\n\u0393L + \u0393R\n\n(3.15)\n\nin terms of the tunneling rate \u0393\u03c7 given by (3.8).\nThe above expression can be further simplified in the following two limits. In the high-temperature limit (\u03bc, \u2206\u03bc \u226a\nkB T ) the sequential tunneling current takes a simple form\nFIG. 2: Markov chain of spin configurations in the N = 5 nanodisk.\nAn arrow (l) indicates each Markov step between two states with\ndifferent spin configurations.

Hence, the most dominant Markov chain\nconsists only of the states |1i and |2i, and it is denoted as\n(1 \u2194 2). This process yields the spin-up current. We consider\nthe second dominant process. Though E4 < E3 , the state |4i\ncan only be reached via the state |3i, as illustrated in Fig.2.\nNamely, the second dominant chain is (1 \u2194 2 \u2194 3 \u2194 4),\nwhich allows the spin-down current as well as the spin-up current.\nFirst we analyze the most dominant process, which involves\nonly the ground state and the first excited state (Fig.2).

It includes four states (1 \u2194 2 \u2194 3 \u2194 4), as shown in the Fig.2.\nIn this approximation, the transition matrix becomes a tridiagonal matrix, and we can solve the master equations exactly.\nThe nonequilibrium density of states is calculated as\n\u03c1s =\n\n\u03c1es\n,\nTre\n\u03c1s\n\n\u03c1es =\n\ns\u22121\nY\ni=1\n\nW (i + 1, i)\n,\nW (i, i + 1)\n\n(3.19)\n\nwhere the index s = 1, 2, 3, 4 stands for the four states with\nthe energy Es .

In other words, we can control the polarization of the\nnanodisk spin by using the spin-polarized current. We note\nthat this is possible since the nanodisk is a quasi-ferromagnet.\nIndeed, there exist no effective magnetic field (4.7) in the conventional ferromagnet.\nV. SPINTRONIC DEVICES AND APPLICATIONS\n\nWe summarize the spin properties of a nanodisk and\nan incoming electric current. First of all, being a quasiferromagnet, the nanodisk has a definite polarization. With\nrespect to the incoming electric current there are three cases.\n(1) The polarized current, where all electrons have a definite\npolarization, rotates the nanodisk spin to that of the incoming current, as we have shown in Sec.IV. (2) The unpolarized\ncurrent, where the polarization of each electron is completely\nrandom, does not induce any effective magnetic field. Hence\nit is filtered so that the outgoing current is polarized to that of\nthe nanodisk. (3) The partially polarized current, where the\npolarization of each electron is at random but the averaged\npolarization has a definite direction, induces a net effective\nmagnetic field. Hence it rotates the nanodisk spin to that of\nthe incoming current, and then is filtered so that the outgoing\ncurrent is completely polarized to the averaged polarization\nof the incoming current. Furthermore, it is possible to control\nthe nanodisk spin externally by applying magnetic field. Then\nthe outgoing current has the same polarization as that of the\nnanodisk, irrespective of the type of incoming current. Using\nthese properties we propose some applications of graphene\nnanodisks for spintronic devices.\n\n(5.1)\n\nwe may use the nanodisk spin as an information. Next, we can\nread-out this information by applying a spin-unpolarized current. The outgoing current from a nanodisk is spin-polarized\nto the direction of the nanodisk spin. Thus we can obtain the\ninformation of the nanodisk spin by observing the outgoing\ncurrent. Finally, the direction of the nanodisk spin can be controlled by applying a spin-polarized current into the nanodisk.\nThus, the nanodisk spin satisfies the conditions as a memory device. The important point is that the size is of the order\nof nanometer, and it is suitable as a nanodevice.\nB. Spin Amplifier\n\nThe second example is a spin amplifier. We inject a\npartially-polarized-spin current, whose average direction we\ntake to be up for definiteness. Thus, I\u2191in > I\u2193in > 0. On\nthe other hand, the direction of the nanodisk spin is arbitrary.\nSince spins in the nanodisk feel an effective magnetic field\nproportional to I\u2191in \u2212 I\u2193in , they are forced to align with that of\nthe partially-polarized-spin current after making damped precession. By using (4.12) the time dependence is given by\nI\u2191 (t) = I\u2191in cos\nI\u2193 (t) = I\u2193in sin\n\n1\n\u03b8 (t)\n= I\u2191in p\n, (5.2a)\n2\n1 + exp [\u22122t/\u03c4filter ]\n\n1\n\u03b8 (t)\n= I\u2193in p\n,\n2\n1 + exp [2t/\u03c4filter ]\n\n(5.2b)\n\nwhere we have set t0 = 0, which means \u03b8 (0) = \u03c0/2: See\nFig.5. The outgoing current is initially given by\n1\nI\u2191 (0) = \u221a I\u2191in ,\n2\n\n1\nI\u2193 (0) = \u221a I\u2193in .\n2\n\n(5.3)\n\nas a function of the incoming current I\u03c3in . The time scale is\ngiven by the relaxation time (4.13).\nAfter enough time t \u2212 t0 \u226b \u03c4 , all spins in the nanodisk\ntake the up direction and hence the outgoing current I\u03c3out \u2261\nlimt\u2192\u221e I\u03c3 (t) is the perfectly up-polarized one,\nI\u2191out = I\u2191in ,\n\nI\u2193out = 0.\n\n(5.4)\n\nConsequently, the small difference I\u2191in \u2212 I\u2193in is amplified to\nthe large current I\u2191in . The amplification ratio is given by\nI\u2191in /(I\u2191in \u2212 I\u2193in ), which can be very large. This effect is very\nimportant because the signal of spin will easily suffer from\ndamping by disturbing noise in leads. By amplifying the signal we can make circuits which are strong against noises.\n\n\f7\n\nFIG. 5: Relaxation process of spin amplifier. The horizontal axis is\nthe time t/\u03c4 and\n\u221a the vertical\u221aaxis is the current I\u2191 and I\u2193 . We have\nset I\u2191in = 0.6 2, I\u2193in = 0.4 2. The currents saturate after enough\ntime (t & 2\u03c4 for I\u2191 , t & 5\u03c4 for I\u2193 ), and the amplification ratio is 3\nin this example.\n\nC.\n\nSpin Valve and Spin-Field-Effect Transistor\n\nThe third example is a spin valve, or giant magnetoresistance effect [Fig.6].39,40,41 We set up a system composed of\ntwo nanodisks sequentially connected with leads. We apply\nexternal magnetic field, and control the spin direction of the\nfirst nanodisk to be\n|\u03b8i = cos\n\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n|\u2191i + sin |\u2193i ,\n2\n2\n\n(5.5)\n\nFIG. 6: Illustration of spin valve with unpolarized current incoming\nfrom left. Spins of each nanodisk are controled by the external magnetic field. The unpolarized current is filtered by the left nanodisk,\nand only electrons whose spin direction is the same as the nanodisk\nspin go through the centeral lead. (a) The spin valve is made of two\nnanodisks with the same size, which are connected with leads. (b)\nWe apply the external magnetic field in the same direction. The spinpolarized outgoing current flows. (c) We apply the external magnetic\nfield in the opposite directions. The outgoing current is blocked.\n\nand that of the second nanodisk to be\n|0i = |\u2191i .\n\n(5.6)\n\nWe inject an unpolarized-spin current to the first nanodisk.\nThe spin of the lead between the two nanodisks is polarized\ninto the direction of |\u03b8i. Subsequently the current is filtered to\nthe up-spin one by the second nanodisk. The outgoing current\nfrom the second nanodisk is\n\u03b8\nI\u2191out = I\u2191 cos .\n2\n\n(5.7)\n\nSince we can arrange the angle \u03b8 externally, we can control\nthe magnitude of the up-polarized current from zero to one.\nIn this sense the system act as a spin valve.\nThe forth example is a spin-field-effect transistor36 [Fig.7].\nWe again set up a system composed of two nanodisks sequentially connected with leads. We now apply the same external\nmagnetic field to both these nanodisks, and fix their spin direction to be up,\n|0i = |\u2191i .\n\n(5.8)\n\nAs an additional setting, we use a lead between the two nanodisks possessing a strong Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling37,\nHR =\n\n\u03bb\n(px \u03c3 y \u2212 py \u03c3 x ) .\n~\n\n(5.9)\n\nSpins make precession while they pass through the lead. The\nspin-rotation angle is given by4\n\u2206\u03b8 = 2\u03bbm\u2217 L/~,\n\n(5.10)\n\nwhere m\u2217 is the electron effective mass in the lead and L is\nthe length of the lead. We can control \u2206\u03b8 by changing the\ncoupling strength \u03bb externally by applying electric field.42 The\noutgoing current from the second nanodisk is\nI\u2191out = I\u2191 cos\n\n\u2206\u03b8\n.\n2\n\n(5.11)\n\nSince we can arrange the angle \u2206\u03b8 by applying electric field\nand control the magnitude of the up-polarized current from\nzero to one, we expect the system acts as a spin-field-effect\ntransistor as in the conventional case.\n\nD. Spin Diode\n\nThe fifth example is a spin diode [Fig.8]. We use a system\nsimilar to the spin-field-effect transistor but with the following\ndifferences. First, two nanodisks have different sizes. When\nthe left nanodisk is larger than the right nanodisk, the relaxL\nation time of the left nanodisk \u03c4L (\u2261 \u03c4filter\n) is larger than that\nR\nof the right nanodisk \u03c4R (\u2261 \u03c4filter\n),\n\u03c4L > \u03c4R .\n\n(5.12)\n\nSecond, the applied magnetic field is taken so small that the\nnanodisk spin can be controlled by a polarized current. For\ndefiniteness we take the direction of the magnetic field to be\nup. Third, the lead has the Rashba-type interaction such that\n\n\f8\nthe angle \u2206\u03b8 due to the Rashba-type coupling effect. Then it\nenters the right nanodisk. Since the relaxation time is \u03c4R , the\ntotal spin-dependent charge carried by the current is given by\nZ tf\nI\u2191 dt = Q\u2191 (tf ) \u2212 Q\u2191 (ti ) ,\n(5.15a)\nQ\u2191 =\nti\ntf\n\nQ\u2193 =\n\nZ\n\nti\n\nI\u2193 dt = Q\u2193 (tf ) \u2212 Q\u2193 (ti )\n\n(5.15b)\n\nwith\nQ\u2191 (t) =I in \u03c4R sinh\u22121 [exp [(t \u2212 t0 ) /\u03c4R ]] ,\nin\n\n\u22121\n\nQ\u2193 (t) =I \u03c4R sinh\nFIG. 7: Illustration of spin-field-effect transistor with unpolarized\ncurrent coming from left. We apply the same external magnetic\nfield to both of the nanodisks. The unpolarized current is filtered\nby the left nanodisk, and only up-spin electrons go through the centeral lead. (a) Without external electric field, the electron spin in the\ncentral lead does not rotate, and the outgoing spin-polarized current\nexists. (b) With an appropriate external electric field, since the electron spin in the central lead rotates by the Rashba-type interaction,\nthe outgoing current does not exist.\n\n[exp [\u2212 (t \u2212 t0 ) /\u03c4R ]] .\n\n(5.16a)\n(5.16b)\n\nOn the other hand, when \u2206\u03bc < 0, the current enter the right\nnanodisk and goes out from the left nanodisk. Since the relaxation time is \u03c4L , the total spin-dependent charge is given by\nthe above formulas but with the replacement of \u03c4R by \u03c4L . Because the size of two nanodisk are different, these two currents\nbehave in a different way.\n\nthe rotation angle is \u2206\u03b8 = \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b4 with small \u03b4, say, \u03b4 \u2243\n0.1\u03c0. When no currents enter the nanodisk, the direction of\ntwo nanodisk spins is identical due to a tiny external magnetic\nfield. When we inject the current in this state, the net outgoing\ncurrent is very small,\nI\n\nout\n\n\u03c0\u2212\u03b4\n= cos\n\u2243 0.\n2\n\n(5.13)\n\nThis is the \"off\" state of spin diode.\n\nFIG. 9: Pulse wave. The horizontal axis is the time and the vertical\naxis is the current. (a) The incoming pulse wave. (b) The outgoing\nwaves for L \u2192 R and R \u2192 L. They are very different for the same\nincoming pulse wave due to the difference in the nanodisk size. We\nhave set ti = 5, tf = 15, and \u03c4L = 3\u03c4R .\n\nWe define the direction dependent total charge\nQ\u03c3 (L \u2192 R) and Q\u03c3 (R \u2192 L), where Q\u03c3 (L \u2192 R) is\nthe total charge with the spin \u03c3 when charges flow from left\nto right, while Q\u03c3 (R \u2192 L) is the total charge when charges\nflow from right to left. We find the relation\nFIG. 8: Illustration of spin diode made of two nanodisks with different size. By controlling the bias voltage \u2206\u03bc, the current flows\nfrom the left lead to the right lead (\u2206\u03bc > 0), or in the opposite way\n(\u2206\u03bc < 0). The incoming current is unpolarized, which is made polarized by the first nanodisk. The electron spin in the central lead is\nrotated by the Rashba-type interaction.\n\nQ\u2191 (L \u2192 R) > Q\u2191 (R \u2192 L) \u226b Q\u2193 (R \u2192 L) > Q\u2193 (L \u2192 R)\n(5.17)\nfrom (5.12), which implies the up (down) component increases (decreases) from the initial value.\nWe define the rectification coefficient by\nR=\n\nLet us inject an unpolarized pulse square current to the system, starting at t = ti and finishing at t = tf ,\nI\u03c3 (t) = I in \u03b8(t \u2212 ti )\u03b8(tf \u2212 t),\n\n(5.14)\n\nwhere \u03c3 denotes the spin. The system become the \"on\" state\nby the pulse. When the bias voltage is such that \u2206\u03bc > 0,\nthe current flows into the left nanodisk and then into the right\nnanodisk. The left nanodisk acts as a spin filter. The current\nin the central lead is initially up-polarized but is rotated by\n\nQ\u2191 (L \u2192 R) + Q\u2193 (L \u2192 R)\n,\nQ\u2191 (R \u2192 L) + Q\u2193 (R \u2192 L)\n\n(5.18)\n\nwhich is approximately equals to\nR\u2243\n\nQ\u2191 (L \u2192 R)\n.\nQ\u2191 (R \u2192 L)\n\n(5.19)\n\nWe illustrate this rectification coefficient as a function of the\npulse width \u2206t = tf \u2212 ti for various initial phases \u03b8 (0) or\nequivalently t0 in Fig.10. Each curve has a peak structure.\nHence, when the relaxation-time ratio \u03c4L /\u03c4R and the initial\n\n\f9\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\n\nFIG. 10: The vertical axis is the rectification coefficient R. The horizontal axis is the pulse width \u2206t = tf \u2212 ti . We plot R for various\ninitial values t0 /\u03c4R = log tan [(\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b4) /2]. We have set \u03c4L = 3\u03c4R .\n\nphase \u03b8 (0) are given, it is possible to optimize the width \u2206t\nso that the rectification coefficient R is maximized. This maximized value of R diverges as \u03b8 (0) \u2192 \u03c0. However, the relaxation time diverges as well. It would be efficient to take the\ninitial phase \u03b8 (0) to make t0 /\u03c4R \u2243 5 for a spin diode.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n13\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n18\n\nS.

We may regard it as a quasi-ferromagnet characterized by the exchange energy as large as the Coulomb\nenergy. The system is well approximated by the SU(N)\nHeisenberg-Hubbard model. The relaxation time is finite but\nquite large even if the size is very small. Being a ferromagnet,\nit can be used as a spin filter. Namely, only electrons with spin\nparallel to the spin of the nanodisk can go through it. Additionally, it has a novel feature that it is not a rigid ferromagnet.\nThe incoming spin-polarized current can rotate the nanodisk\nspin itself. Combining the advantages of both these properties,\nwe have proposed a rich variety of spintronic devices, such as\nspin memory, spin amplifier, spin valve, spin-field-effect transistor and spin diode. Graphene nanodisks could well be basic\ncomponents of future nanoelectronic and spintronic devices.\nI am very much grateful to N. Nagaosa and S.
