It gives the physical meaning of the gauge invariant\noverlaps for the solution in our previous paper and supports Ellwood's recent proposal in the\noperator formalism.\n\nIn our previous paper [1], it was discussed that a class of gauge invariant observables\ngives the same values for the analytic solution [2] given by Schnabl as the ones for the\nnumerical solution [3, 4, 5] in the level truncation in open string field theory [6]. It\ngives another interesting evidence that the numerical solution is gauge equivalent to\nthe analytic solution.\nThe gauge invariant observables OV (\u03a8) for an open string field \u03a8 are called gauge\ninvariant overlaps in [1] and are given by\nOV (\u03a8) = hV (i)fI [\u03a8]i = hI| V (i) |\u03a8i ,\n\nfI (z) \u2261\n\n2z\n,\n1 \u2212 z2\n\nwhere the CFT correlator is defined on an upper half plane. The on-shell closed string\nvertex operator V (i) is inserted at the midpoint of the open string, and the conformal\nmapping fI (z) plays the role of the identity state hI|, identifying the left half of the\nstring with its right half. They were originally discussed in [7] to give the interaction\nof an on-shell closed string with open strings in the open string field theory.\nFor the analytic solution\n|\u03a8\u03bb=1 i = |\u03c80 i +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(|\u03c8n+1 i \u2212 |\u03c8n i \u2212 \u2202r |\u03c8r i |r=n ) \u2261 |\u03c80 i + |\u03c7i ,\n\nn=0\n\n1\n\n\fsince it was shown [1, 8] that OV (\u03c8r ) doesn't depend on r, one can see that\nOV (\u03a8\u03bb=1 ) = hI| V (i) |\u03a8\u03bb=1 i = hI| V (i) |\u03c80 i .\nTherefore, it suggests that only the first term |\u03c80 i contributes to the gauge invariant\noverlaps OV (\u03a8\u03bb=1 ).\nIn the paper [1], the gauge invariant overlaps were used to examine whether the numerical solution is gauge equivalent to the analytic solution, but their physical meaning\nwasn't clear. Recently, Ellwood has made an interesting proposal [8] that the gauge\ninvariant overlaps are related to the closed string tadpoles as\nOV (\u03a8) = A\u03a8 (V ) \u2212 A0 (V ),\nwhere A\u03a8 (V ) is the disk amplitude for a closed string vertex operator V with the\nboundary condition of the CFT given by the open string field solution \u03a8, and A0 (V )\nis the usual disk amplitude in the perturbative vacuum.\nIn fact, for the analytic solution, he has shown that this is the case. Since, after\ntachyon condensation, there are no D-branes, no closed tadpoles are available, and thus\nA\u03a8 (V ) = 0. Therefore, the gauge invariant overlap OV (\u03a8) for the solution gives the\nusual disk amplitude of the opposite sign with one closed string emitted. It suggests\nthat the analytic solution given by Schnabl is closely related to the boundary state\ndescribing a D-brane in the closed string perturbation theory, as expected.\nIn this note, we will explicitly demonstrate this in the operator formalism of open\nstring field theory by using the Shapiro-Thorn vertex h\u03b3\u0302(1c , 2)| [9], which maps an open\nstring state to the corresponding closed string state. (For more detail, see appendix B\nin [1].) By using the open-closed string vertex h\u03b3\u0302(1c , 2)|, as discussed in detail in [1],\none may rewrite a gauge invariant overlap as\nOV (\u03c8) = h\u03b3\u0302(1c , 2)|\u03c6c i1c |\u03c8i2 ,\nwhere |\u03c6c i1c is an on-shell state given by the vertex operator V of the closed string 1c ,\nand |\u03c8i2 is a state of the open string 2.\nFor the analytic solution, one has\nOV (\u03a8\u03bb=1 ) = h\u03b3\u0302(1c , 2)|\u03c6ci1c |\u03a8\u03bb=1 i2\n= h\u03b3\u0302(1c , 2)|\u03c6ci1c |\u03c80 i2 + h\u03b3\u0302(1c , 2)|\u03c6c i1c |\u03c7i2 ,\nand as mentioned above, the second term on the right hand side is zero for the on-shell\nclosed string state |\u03c6c i1c . As for the first term on the right hand side, one can see that\nthe open string tachyon state |\u03c80 i = (2/\u03c0)c1 |0i is transformed via the vertex h\u03b3\u0302(1c , 2)|\ninto the boundary state hB |. In fact, one can obtain the relation\nh\u03b3\u0302(1c , 2)|\u03c80 i2 P1c =\n2\n\n1\nhB | c\u2212\n0\n2\u03c0\n\n\fwith the level matching projection P1c for the closed string 1c , where the boundary\nstate is the usual one\n\u2212\nhB | = h0| c\u22121 c\u0304\u22121 c+\n0e\n\n1\nn=1 [ n \u03b1n *\u1fb1n +cn b\u0304n +c\u0304n bn ]\n\nP\u221e\n\nin the closed string perturbation theory. One thus finds that\nOV (\u03a8\u03bb=1 ) =\n\n1\nhB | c\u2212\n0 |\u03c6c i ,\n2\u03c0\n\nwhich is in precise agreement with Ellwood's result.\nSince the second term h\u03b3\u0302(1c , 2)|\u03c6ci1c |\u03c7i2 doesn't necessarily vanish for off-shell\nclosed string states, one may conclude that the transform of the analytic solution\n|\u03a8\u03bb=1 i via the Shapiro-Thorn vertex is an off-shell extension of the boundary state |Bi.\nAlthough it seems more elaborate to calculate h\u03b3\u0302(1c , 2)|\u03c7i2 , it would be interesting to\nfind the relation of the off-shell boundary state with the equation of motion in closed\nstring field theory [10, 11, 12].\nFurthermore, given all the interactions between open strings and closed strings in\nthe open-closed string field theory [13], one may raise a question whether the Schnabl\nsolution is consistent with the equations of motion of the open-closed string field theory,\neven in the vanishing string coupling constant limit, but it is beyond the scope of this\npaper. However, if it is consistent, the relation of the transform of the analytic solution\n|\u03a8\u03bb=1 i via the Shapiro-Thorn vertex with the boundary state |Bi could be clearer along\nwith the interactions of the theory [13]. We think that our observation in this paper\nmay serve as an encouraging step in the investigation.1\n\nAcknowledgement\nWe are grateful to Taichiro Kugo for relevantly useful discussions.
