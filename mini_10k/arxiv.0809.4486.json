Fitting the spectra with asymmetric peak profiles,\nwe find that the asymmetry associated with velocity line profiles is negative for all\nfrequency ranges agreeing with previous observations while the asymmetry of the\nintensity profiles shows a complex and frequency dependent behavior. We also\nobserve systematic frequency differences between intensity and velocity spectra\nat the high end of the frequency range, mostly above 4 mHz. We infer that this\ndifference arises from the fitting of the intensity rather than the velocity spectra.\nWe also show that the frequency differences between intensity and velocity do\nnot vary significantly from the disk center to the limb when the spectra are fitted\nwith the asymmetric profile and conclude that only a part of the background is\ncorrelated with the intensity oscillations.\nSubject headings: Sun: helioseismology \u2013Sun: oscillations \u2013 Sun: interior\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nDifferent helioseismic instruments, both from ground and space, observe the Sun in different observables. Due to the different techniques used by these instruments, it is possible\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nto measure the solar oscillations simultaneously either as variations in the photospheric velocity or as intensity fluctuations. It is therefore important to confirm that the oscillation\nmode parameters measured from both the intensity and velocity agree with each other to a\nhigh degree of precision. However, the initial measurement of low degree p-mode frequencies from Doppler velocity (V ) and continuum intensity (Ic ) observations from Michelson\nDoppler Imager (MDI) instrument on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)\nshowed systematic differences. A comparison of 108-day power spectra between V and Ic\nshowed a weighted mean difference of \u22120.1 \u03bcHz for l = 0, and \u22120.16 \u03bcHz for l = 1 modes\n(Toutain et al. 1997). Since the apparent frequency shift between an oscillation observed in\nvelocity and intensity cannot be a property of the mode, it must arise from systematic errors\nwhile calculating the frequencies from the observed power spectra. Hence it was argued that\nthe source of the systematic difference could be due to the opposite asymmetry effect seen\nbetween the velocity and intensity power spectra (Duvall et al. 1993). Appourchaux et al.\n(1998) also presented a similar evidence using VIRGO and SOI/MDI data. Around the same\ntime Harvey et al. (1998) reported that the intermediate degree modes observed in V and\ntotal spectral intensity also show different central frequencies and observed that the apparent\ndifferences could be as large as 50 \u03bcHz close to the acoustic cut-off frequency. However, the\nanalysis of Nigam & Kosovichev (1998), using an asymmetric line profile-fitting formula,\nillustrated that the frequency difference between V and Ic in the intermediate degree range\nis much smaller compared to that obtained by fitting a symmetric Lorentzian profile. Using\nthe same asymmetric line profile-fitting formula, Toutain et al. (1998) re-analyzed the data\nfrom MDI and showed that the frequency differences between V and Ic are considerably reduced. Gavryusev & Gavryuseva (1999) have also analyzed data from different instruments\nand have argued that the reported frequency shift is merely an artifact of the reduction\ntechnique.\nRenewed interest in the topic began when local helioseismic techniques were developed\nto study the properties of high-degree modes in localized regions. Basu, Antia, & Bogart\n(2001) analyzed azimuthally averaged (2-d) power spectra and inferred that the eigenfrequencies obtained using the asymmetric peak profiles agree reasonably well with each other while\nthe use of symmetric profiles gives significant differences between frequencies computed using\ncontinuum intensity and velocity or continuum intensity and line-depth spectra. In order\nto gain further information for high-degree and high-frequency modes, Jain, Hill, & Toner\n(2003) analyzed the high-resolution GONG+ data. These authors also compared the azimuthally averaged power spectra of a region centered on the equator and reported that the\nfrequency dependence of the frequency shift between V and I is negligible below the acoustic\ncutoff frequency around 5.3 mHz and substantial above the cutoff. These results supported\nthe finding of Harvey et al. (1998). However, the conclusion is based on the visual compar-\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nison of the peak frequency of the power spectra and may not necessarily be a true measure\nof the shift due to the reversal of the asymmetry and different background power between\nV and Ic spectra.\nIt is now well established that line asymmetry of the solar power spectra alters the\npeak frequencies that are obtained under the assumption that the lines are symmetric\n(e.g. Antia & Basu (1999); Basu & Antia (2000). However, the cause of the opposite\nasymmetry between the velocity and intensity spectra still remains inconclusive. The current understanding is that the reversal in the sign of asymmetry between the V and Ic\nspectra is due to the influence of the solar background noise that is correlated with the\nsource (Roxburgh & Vorontsov 1997; Nigam et al. 1998; Severino et al. 2001) and the\nlevel depends on the characteristic granulation. On the other hand, the numerical simulation (Georgobiani, Stein, & Nordlund 2003) indicates that the reversal is produced by the\nradiative transfer effects. Since the physics of the correlated noise is not yet fully understood\nand the spatial leakage signature for V and I is different due to their center-to-limb variations, our objective is to examine the frequency dependence of the observed asymmetry and\ndifferences in eigenfrequencies between velocity and intensity observations as a function of\nthe radial distance from the disk center to the limb. A preliminary investigation of a similar\nnature using azimuthally averaged power spectra is reported in Tripathy et al. (2006). However the present analysis differs from all earlier ones since here we use the three-dimensional\n(3-d) power spectrum, which is associated with flow fields, while the azimuthally averaged\nspectrum has no flow fields associated with it.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: We briefly describe the data and analysis\ntechnique in Section 2, while the results are described in Section 3. Finally, we summarize\nthe main conclusions in Section 4.\n\n2.\n\nData and the Technique\n\nWe use the Dopplergrams and continuum intensity images obtained by the MDI instrument during the period of 1997 May 19 \u2013 21 when solar activity was near minimum. We\nhave chosen 4 regions centered at heliographic longitudes of 0\u25e6 , 15\u25e6 , 30\u25e6 , and 45\u25e6 ; all centered\nat the equator. The spatial extent of each of the localized region covers 256 \u00d7 256 pixels in\nheliographic longitude and latitude and gives a resolution of 0.01616 Mm\u22121 . Each region is\ntracked for 4096 minutes, which gives a frequency resolution of 4.07 \u03bcHz. The standard ring\ndiagram technique (Hill 1988) was used to obtain the power as a function of (kx , ky , \u03bd).\nTo extract the frequencies and other mode parameters, the three-dimensional power\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nspectrum is fitted with a model with asymmetric peak profiles of the form\neB1 eB2\n+ 4\nk3\nk\nexp(A0 + (k \u2212 k0 )A1 + A2 ( kkx )2 + A3 kxkk2 y )Sx\n+\nx2 + 1\nP (kx , ky , \u03bd) =\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\n\u03bd \u2212 ck p \u2212 Ux kx \u2212 Uy ky\n,\nw0 + w1 (k \u2212 k0 )\n= S 2 + (1 + Sx)2 .\n\nx =\nSx\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nHere P is the oscillation power for a mode with a temporal frequency \u03bd and the total\np\nwavenumber k = kx2 + ky2 . The peak power in the mode is represented as exp(A0 ) while\nthe coefficients A1 to A3 account for the variation in power with k and along the ring. The\nterms involving B1 and B2 define the background power and w0 is the mode width. The\nterm ck p gives the mean frequency, and this form is chosen as it gives satisfactory fits to the\nmean frequency over the whole fitting interval. The parameters S controls the asymmetry\nin the peaks, and the form of asymmetry is the same as that used by Nigam & Kosovichev\n(1998) i.e. the parameter is positive for positive asymmetry and negative for negative asymmetry. By setting S = 0 we can also fit symmetric Lorentzian profiles. A more detailed\ndescription of the parameters and fitting procedure is described in Basu, Antia, & Tripathy\n(1999) and Basu & Antia (1999). The 13 parameters (A0 , A1 , A2 , A3 , B1 , B2 , c, p, S, Ux ,\nUy , w0 , w1 ) are determined by fitting the spectra using the maximum likelihood approach\n\u22121\n(Anderson, Duvall, & Jefferies 1990). In this work we express k in units of R\u2299\nso that k is\nidentified with the degree l of the spherical harmonic of the corresponding global mode.\n\n3.\n\nResults and Discussions\n\nFigure 1 shows a characteristic l\u2212\u03bd diagram obtained from the fits to the power spectra\nat the disk center using asymmetric profile corresponding to Eq. (1). In general we obtain\nabout 750 and 600 modes from the velocity and intensity spectra respectively. Intensity\nspectra normally yields less number of modes due to the inherently lower signal-to-noise\nratio. The number of fitted modes also decreases for regions that are away from the disk\ncenter. Comparing the number of modes between symmetric and asymmetric fits we find\nthat the symmetric fit yields more modes. This implies that the inclusion of the asymmetry\nin the fitting formula reduces the number of modes that are successfully fitted. This could\nbe due to some cross-correlation between S and other parameters of the model, particularly,\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nthe background. Although, we fit the spectra up to radial order of n = 6, we restrict the\nanalysis up to n = 4 modes since higher order radial modes have large estimated fitting\nerrors.\n\n3.1.\n\nAsymmetry of Peak Profiles\n\nPhysically, asymmetry is a result of an interaction between an outward-directed wave\nfrom the source and a corresponding inward-directed wave that passes through the region of\nwave propagation (Duvall et al. 1993). To illustrate the peaks in the power spectra and to\nvisualize the asymmetry associated with different observables, we show an example of the\nazimuthally averaged power for l = 675 corresponding to the disk center spectra for V and\nIc in Figure 2. It is apparent that the line profiles are asymmetric. At low frequency, the\nasymmetry agrees with the known results; the velocity spectrum has negative asymmetry\ni.e. more power on the lower frequency side of the peak while the continuum intensity\nspectrum show positive asymmetry i.e. more power on the higher frequency side of the\npeak. This reversal of asymmetry is believed to arise from the addition of correlated noise\nto the amplitude spectra (Nigam et al. 1998). In addition, we notice that the asymmetry\nassociated with velocity spectra appears to be reduced or even reversed at higher frequencies.\nVisual inspection of the azimuthally averaged power spectra show a comprehensible frequency\nshift of the central frequency between V and Ic above the cutoff frequency of 5.3 mHz. We\nalso observe that the velocity power is higher near the disk center and decreases toward the\nlimb in agreement with the predominately radial nature of the oscillatory velocity field.\nFigure 3 shows the asymmetry of the line profiles as a function of frequency obtained\nfrom fitting the three dimensional power spectra at disk center and 45\u25e6 E longitude. As\nexpected, this parameter is predominantly negative for all modes in the velocity spectra\n(upper panels) indicating that there is more power on the low frequency side of the peak.\nThe asymmetry is minimum around 3 mHz while at low end of the frequency range the\nasymmetry of p2 and higher order radial modes is more likely to be zero within the estimated\nerrors. Thus, in this frequency range the mode frequencies obtained from asymmetric and\nsymmetric profiles should be nearly identical. Surprisingly, we do not observe the asymmetry\nto be reversed at higher frequencies as noted above and also in Tripathy et al. (2006).\nThe asymmetry for the intensity spectra (lower panels of Figure 3) appears to be more\ncomplex and in general these are larger than the velocity asymmetry. For f and p1 -modes,\nthis parameter is primarily positive (more power on the higher frequency end of the peak)\nand increases with frequency. For higher order p-modes, asymmetry is negative both at\nlow- and high-end of the frequency range and is likely to be insignificant or zero at other\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nfrequencies. Thus the asymmetry is different than what is observed for low-degree modes\n(Toutain et al. 1998), intermediate degree modes (Nigam et al. 1998), and high-degree\nmodes obtained from the azimuthally averaged spectra (Tripathy et al. 2006). Although\nmost of these differences may be due to frequency, we do not rule out the possibility that the\nform of asymmetry used in the model are simplified and may not represent the real profiles\nadequately at all frequencies. The asymmetry may also weakly depend on l (Basu & Antia\n1999) and this dependence has been neglected in the fitting formula. Finally, we note that\nthe asymmetry of both velocity and intensity spectra do not show any significant changes at\ndifferent locations on the solar disk.\n\n3.2.\n\nComparison of asymmetry between 2-d and 3-d fitting\n\nIt is interesting to compare the asymmetries from 3-d spectra with those obtained from\nazimuthally averaged spectra. Figure 4 illustrates the asymmetries obtained from both the\nfits. While the asymmetry observed in intensity spectra obtained from 2-d fits are entirely\npositive, the behavior is more complex in the 3-d spectra. On the other hand, asymmetry\nassociated with 3-d velocity spectra is entirely negative while for 2-d spectra, it reverses\nsign at high end of the frequency range. Thus significant differences are seen between the\nasymmetry obtained from fitting the three-dimensional and azimuthally averaged power\nspectra.\nAlthough it is not easy to understand these differences due to the different functional\nform of the model profiles to fit different spectra (six parameters are fitted in azimuthal\nspectra as opposed to 13 in the three-dimensional spectra), we have made a preliminary\nattempt by constructing synthetic 3D spectra with S = \u22120.05. This spectra are then\nazimuthally averaged and fitted to calculate the asymmetry in peak profiles. Because of\nnon-zero values of velocities (Ux , Uy ) the process of azimuthal averaging also introduces\nsome asymmetry and hence the value of S in azimuthally averaged spectra is not the same\nas that used in preparing the 3D spectra. The effect of varying the flow velocity (Ux &\nUy ) and background term, B1 is shown in Fig 5. The synthetic spectra were constructed\nwith a uniform amplitude A0 = 50, width w0 = 40 \u03bcHz and included only the f-mode ridge.\nThe background in synthetic spectra included only the first term with different values of B1 .\nThe effect of velocity increases with k and hence the shift in asymmetry from input value\nalso increases with k. Further, since A0 and B1 are constant, the peak to background ratio\nincreases with k. It is clear that even when the flow velocities are increased beyond their\nnormal values, the maximum change in S is about than 0.02 at the highest value of l and\nrather large velocity is required to make significant differences. Similar results are obtained\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nwhen spectra with different values of S were used. In all cases azimuthal averaging tends to\nincrease the value of S, though the effect may be small.\n\n3.3.\n\nSource of the asymmetry\n\nPeak asymmetry is believed to have a contribution from the acoustic source location and a contribution from the effects of correlated background noise from the source.\nRoxburgh & Vorontsov (1997) have argued that the line asymmetries occur due to the\nmodes correlated with velocity background while to reach the same effect, Nigam et al.\n(1998) have proposed a small amount of intensity-correlated background. The amount of\ncoherent correlated background, as well as the need of this component to model both V and\nIc , has also been debated (e.g. Straus et al. (2001)).\nIn order to understand the role of the background power in the reversal of the asymmetry\nbetween V and Ic , we plot the background power as a function of degree l of the mode in\nFigure 6. In the same plot, we also show the background power obtained from the symmetric\nfits (open symbols). It is clear that the background power obtained from symmetric and\nasymmetric fitting of the velocity spectra (upper panel) closely agree with each other. In\ncontrast the intensity spectrum returns a significantly higher background power when fitted\nwith the asymmetric line profile compared to the symmetric profile. This indicates that the\nline asymmetry is reversed in the intensity. Since granulation contrast decreases from the\ndisk center to the limb, we also expect the background power to decrease near the limb. But\nno significant variation in power is noticed from the disk center to the limb which supports\nthe idea that only a part of the background is correlated with the intensity oscillations\n(Nigam & Kosovichev 1999; Barban & Hill 2004).\n\n3.4.\n\nFrequency Differences\n\nThe frequency differences from the symmetric fits to both V and Ic spectra at four\ndifferent longitudes are plotted in Figure 7. The frequencies obtained from the intensity\nspectrum are systematically higher than the frequencies from the velocity spectrum, as one\nwould expect due to the reversal of the line asymmetry. For the disk center spectra, the\ndifferences, in general, are on the order of 10 \u03bcHz or less up to \u03bd \u2264 4 mHz; the minimum\ndifference of about 2\u20133 \u03bcHz is seen for p2 and higher radial order modes in the 5\u2013min band.\nSince near the limb we primarily observe the horizontal velocity field which is dominated by\ngranulation, it is expected that the frequency difference between intensity and velocity should\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\ndecrease near the limb due to a decrease in correlation with oscillations. But we find that\nthe difference increases systematically from the disk center to the limb. This again supports\nthe idea that only a part of the background is correlated with the intensity oscillations.\nThe use of asymmetric profiles to fit the power spectra results in a better determination of the mode frequencies and as a result the frequency differences between velocity and\nintensity is significantly diminished (Figure 8). Similar to fits with symmetric profiles, the\ndifferences are mostly positive as the frequencies obtained from intensity fluctuations are\nhigher than those from the velocity. However, the f-modes show some exception at the high\nend of the frequency where the peak frequencies observed in velocity are marginally higher\n(and clearly larger than the estimated errors) than those observed in intensity. The differences between higher order radial modes, mainly p3 and p4 , are slightly bigger but these\nmodes also have a large uncertainty in the fitted frequencies as seen from the error estimates.\nAlthough subtle variations are evident between different longitudes, the frequency differences\ndo not reveal any systematic trend between the disk center and 45\u25e6 longitude.\nAlthough the asymmetric fitting formula reduces the frequency differences between the\nvelocity and intensity spectra, there still remains some systematic differences of the order of\n5 \u2013 10 \u03bcHz, which is much higher than the uncertainty in estimated errors. Basu, Antia, & Bogart\n(2001) have reported a similar result based on the analysis of azimuthally averaged spectra\nand have argued that the assumed profiles does not adequately describe the velocity spectra where the signal-to-noise ratio is high. However, our result indicates that the form of\nasymmetry used for intensity spectra may not be a correct representation of the real profiles.\nTo demonstrate this, we show the difference in eigenfrequencies between identical modes\nobtained from the power spectra at different longitudes with respect to the spectra at the\ndisk center in Figure 9. The frequency difference in V shows little variation in longitude\nfor frequencies less than 3.5 mHz. Variations between intensity spectra are higher than seen\nin velocity. Moreover, the shapes of the curve in Figure 9 for velocity are similar as are\nthe shapes of the curves in intensity, leading to the frequency differences shown in Figure 8.\nTherefore it appears that the use of an asymmetric line profile provides more accurate estimates of the eigenfrequencies of solar oscillation for velocity rather than for intensity. In\naddition, fitting the intensity spectra is more challenging than fitting the velocity spectra\ndue to low amplitudes and low signal-to-noise ratio. The number of modes fitted from the\nintensity spectra clearly supports this conjecture.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n4.\n\nConclusions\n\nUsing the local helioseismic technique of ring diagram analysis we have studied the highdegree f- and p-mode frequency differences between velocity and continuum intensity data\nobtained from the MDI instrument during a quiet period. Since the spectra are known to be\nasymmetric, we fitted the three-dimensional spectra with an asymmetric model profile based\non the known form of the asymmetry observed in velocity and intensity. The asymmetry\nobtained from fitting the velocity spectra agrees with the previous results while that of intensity shows a frequency dependent behavior. We further notice significant differences between\nthe asymmetry obtained from fitting the three-dimensional and azimuthally averaged power\nspectra.\nFitting the three-dimensional disk center power spectra with a symmetric Lorentzian\nprofiles leads to frequency differences on the order of 10 \u03bcHz or less up to \u03bd \u2264 4 mHz\nbetween intensity and velocity. This difference is found to be increasing systematically from\nthe disk center to the limb. The use of asymmetric profiles leads to frequency differences\nthat are smaller than the differences resulting from the symmetric fits. However, systematic\ndifferences still remain at the high end of the frequency range, mostly above 4 mHz. We\ndemonstrate that this difference arises from the fitting of the intensity rather than the velocity\nspectra. We speculate that the form of asymmetry used in the model for the intensity spectra\nis over-simplified and does not adequately represent the real profile at all frequency ranges.\nWe also conclude that the frequency differences between velocity and intensity do not\nvary significantly from the disk center to the limb. However, variations between intensity\nspectra are higher than seen in velocity. This supports the idea that only a part of the\nbackground is correlated with the intensity oscillations. In this context several authors (e.g.\nSeverino et al. (2001); Barban, Hill & Kras (2004); Toutain et al. (2006)) have advocated\nthe importance of fitting the intensity-velocity cross spectrum along with a multicomponent\nmodel of the coherent background. This provides an impetus for future work using the\nhigh-resolution observations from Solar Dynamics Observatory.\nThis study uses data from MDI/SOHO. SOHO is a mission of international cooperation\nbetween ESA and NASA. This work was supported by NASA grant NNG 5-11703 and NNG\n05HAL41I.\n\nREFERENCES\nAnderson, E., Duvall, T.
