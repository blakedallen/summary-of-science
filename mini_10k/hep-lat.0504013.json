With \"mixed action\" we refer to any lattice theory in\nwhich differently discretized fermions are used in the valence- and sea-quark sectors.\nThis development originates from the desire to use a relatively affordable method to\nsimulate the sea quarks, using for instance various kinds of Wilson-like or staggered\nfermions, combined with a need for very good chiral symmetry in the valence sector,\nwhich can be obtained by using staggered or Ginsparg\u2013Wilson quarks.\nThe worry about mixed actions is that they do not satisfy some of the basic properties of a healthy quantum-field theory, such as the possibility to analytically continue\nto Minkowski space and unitarity. We recall that the same is true for quenched and\npartially quenched (PQ) theories. However, the PQ theory reduces to full QCD if\nvalence- and sea-quark masses are taken equal. In the mixed-action case, no such\nlimit exists at non-zero lattice spacing.\nIn this paper we will make the following working assumptions. (1) Any new\nunphysical effects resulting from the use of a mixed action disappear in the continuum\nlimit; (2) At finite lattice spacing, these effects are controlled by positive powers of the\nlattice spacing a, i.e. they only show up through systematically manageable scaling\nviolations; (3) One can use effective-field theory techniques to investigate their size.\nEffective field theory has proven to be a very useful tool for investigating the\nunphysical effects resulting from quenching and partial quenching, and we expect the\nsame for any new effects resulting from the use of mixed actions. The idea is then\nsimply to look for observables which are expected to be maximally affected by the\nscaling violations of a mixed action. Our experience with PQ theories gives us a clue\nfor where to look. When the valence-quark masses are chosen unequal to the seaquark masses, the most infrared-sensitive unphysical effects originate in the double\npole that occurs in flavor-neutral Goldstone-meson two-point functions [1].\nMore generally, the double pole is an unphysical effect which arises from choosing\nthe valence-quark action unequal to the sea-quark action. Other unphysical effects\nare known to arise from lattice-fermion actions containing beyond nearest-neighbor\ncouplings, and from gauge actions containing Wilson loops larger than a single plaquette. These actions often lack reflection positivity, and, hence, unitarity at finite\nlattice spacing. Under such circumstances it is imperative to take the continuum limit\nbefore analytically continuing to Minkowski space. It is generally believed that the\nnotion of universality applies to the continuum limit obtained this way: one expects\nthe same continuum limit regardless of the details of the regularization, i.e. of the\nlattice discretization. We expect that universality extends to mixed actions, and our\nworking assumptions translate this expectation into more concrete terms. A practical test then lies in comparing the results we obtain using chiral perturbation theory\nto numerical lattice calculations. Agreement would indicate that the assumptions\nunderlying our effective-field theory calculations are valid.\nWe will consider three classes of mixed actions, namely those with Wilson-like\n(Wilson, clover, twisted-mass Wilson) sea and valence quarks, those with Wilson-like\nsea quarks and Ginsparg\u2013Wilson (GW) valence quarks, and those with GW valence\n2\n\n\fand sea quarks. The latter refers to any lattice fermion satisfying the GW relation [2]\neither exactly or to a good approximation; overlap, domain-wall, and perfect-action\nfermions included.\nIn all cases, we will assume that different discretizations have been chosen in the\nvalence and sea sectors, i.e. that the lattice Dirac operators for the valence- and the\nsea-quarks differ not only in their bare mass parameters (this includes for instance\nsmearing the links in the valence sector but not in the sea sector). For simplicity we\nwill restrict the discussion to degenerate masses in the sea and valence sectors. Our\nresults can be generalized straightforwardly to non-degenerate and twisted quarkmass matrices.\nThe chiral lagrangian for mixed-action lattice QCD with Wilson-like and GW\nfermions has been considered before in Refs. [3, 4], which we take as our starting\npoint.1 In Sec. 2 we discuss the relevant elements of the chiral effective theory. We\ncalculate the residue of the double pole in the two-point function of flavor-neutral\nGoldstone mesons, including the leading-order scaling violations. We then derive our\nmain result: In a mixed-action theory there is a double pole in this two-point function,\neven if the charged Goldstone mesons made out of valence quarks and those made out\nof sea quarks have equal masses. If the sea and/or the valence action is Wilson-like,\nthe residue of the double pole is of order a2 .\nWe then go on in Sec. 3 to consider the size of this effect for some interesting\nphysical quantities which are particularly sensitive to the anomalous infrared behavior\noriginating from a double pole. In particular, we consider the I = 0 two-pion energy\nshift in finite volume, where the double pole causes an anomalous enhancement as a\nfunction of the volume [6], as well as the two-point function of the I = 1 scalar meson\n(the a0 ), which has anomalous behavior for large euclidean time [7].2 Our conclusions\nare in Sec. 4.\n\n2\n\nThe residue of the double pole in mixed theories\n\nOur analysis starts from the results of Refs. [3, 4]. We first consider the implementation of both valence and sea quarks through Wilson-like fermions. \"Wilson-like\"\nstands for any lattice fermion with exact flavor symmetry,3 but with no chiral symmetry at non-zero lattice spacing a. In Ref. [4] first the Symanzik effective quark action\nwas constructed4 for Wilson fermions to order a2 . If both valence and sea quarks are\nmade of the same type of Wilson-like fermion, the (vector) symmetry group is that\nof a partially-quenched (PQ) theory [1], SU(K + N|K), where K is the number of\nvalence quarks, and N is the number of sea quarks. In the continuum limit chiral\n1\nFor very recent work considering GW valence quarks with a staggered sea, see Ref. [5]. Here we\nwill not consider staggered fermions.\n2\nSimilar effects also occur in K 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 matrix elements [8].\n3\nAs already mentioned, for simplicity we limit the discussion to degenerate masses in the sea and\nvalence sectors. The generalization to non-degenerate [1] and twisted [9] masses is straightforward.\n4\nFor a review of the method, as well as further references, see Ref. [10].\n\n3\n\n\fsymmetry is restored (for massless quarks), and the symmetry group enlarges to5\nSU(K + N|K)L \u00d7 SU(K + N|K)R .\n\n(partially quenched)\n\n(1)\n\nRef. [4] also considered Wilson-like sea quarks with valence quarks of the GW\ntype [2, 13]. The a 6= 0 mixed-action theory is then invariant under\n[SU(K|K)L \u00d7 SU(K|K)R ] \u00d7 SU(N) . (GW \u2212 Wilson)\n\n(2)\n\nAgain the complete Symanzik effective action was constructed to order a2 . For both\ncases, the complete chiral lagrangian was derived to the same order from the Symanzik\neffective action with the help of a spurion analysis.\nHere we are only interested in the role of the double pole in neutral Goldstone\nmeson propagators, and we will restrict ourselves to operators in the chiral lagrangian\nrelevant for our purpose. However, our aim is to consider also mixed actions in which\nboth valence and sea quarks are Wilson-like, but different. In that case, the symmetry\ngroup is reduced to\nSU(K|K) \u00d7 SU(N) ,\n\n(Wilson \u2212 Wilson)\n\n(3)\n\nand more operators appear in the effective theory.\nIn the continuum limit, the chiral effective lagrangian is just that of PQ QCD\n[1]. In terms of the non-linear field \u03a3 = exp(2i\u03a6/f ), with \u03a6 the matrix of Goldstonemeson fields, the lowest-order (euclidean) chiral lagrangian is\nLcont =\n\n1\n1\n1 2\nf str(\u2202\u03bc \u03a3\u2202\u03bc \u03a3\u2020 ) \u2212 f 2 B0 str(\u03a3M\u2020 + M\u03a3\u2020 ) + \u03bc2 \u03a620 ,\n8\n4\n2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03a60 = str(\u03a6) = (f /2i) log sdet(\u03a3), and f , B0 and \u03bc2 are low-energy constants\n(LECs).6 M is the quark mass matrix,\nM = M\u2020 = diag(mv , mv , . . . , ms , ms , . . . , mv , mv , . . .) ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhile str and sdet are the supertrace and the superdeterminant needed to construct\ninvariants for graded groups. The first K masses are those of the valence quarks, the\nnext N those of the sea quarks, and the final K those of the ghost quarks needed to\ncancel the loops of the valence quarks [14].\nIn Eq. (4) we kept the singlet mass term because we are interested in scaling\nviolations to the singlet mass parameter \u03bc2 . Normally one would not do this because\n\u03bc is considered as being of same order as the chiral-lagrangian cutoff scale \u039b \u2248 4\u03c0f .\nThe pseudo-scalar singlet's mass-squared is equal to N\u03bc2 + 2B0 ms , and so this degree\nof freedom can be integrated out. Accordingly, one could constrain \u03a3 by setting\nsdet(\u03a3) = 1, i.e. \u03a60 = 0. We will indeed recover this result in what follows, and from\nthen on limit ourselves to the theory with the pseudo-scalar singlet integrated out.\nThis is also the reason that we did not keep any other terms containing the singlet\nfield \u03a60 in Eq. (4).\n5\n6\n\nFor explanations about the legitimacy of using this symmetry group, see Refs. [11, 12].\nNote that \u03bc2 (this paper) = \u03bc2 (Ref. [1])/3.\n\n4\n\n\fBecause of the reduced symmetry group (3) for a Wilson-like mixed-action, the\nfollowing operators appear at order a2 in the chiral lagrangian:\n\u03b4LW = \u2212\n\n(af )2 \u0010\n\u03b3vv (str(Pv (\u03a3 \u2212 \u03a3\u2020 )))2 + \u03b3ss (str(Ps (\u03a3 \u2212 \u03a3\u2020 )))2\n32\n\u0011\n+2\u03b3vs str(Pv (\u03a3 \u2212 \u03a3\u2020 )) str(Ps (\u03a3 \u2212 \u03a3\u2020 )) .\n\n(6)\n\nHere Pv and Ps are projectors on the valence, respectively, sea sectors,\nPv = diag(1v , 0, 1g ) ,\n\nPs = diag(0, 1s , 0) ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere 1v and 1g are the K \u00d7K identity matrices in respectively the valence and ghost\nsectors, and 1s the N \u00d7 N identity matrix in the sea sector. Eq. (6) follows from an\nanalysis very similar to that of Ref. [4]. It was shown there that the corresponding\noperators in the Symanzik effective action are four-fermion operators, which appear\nat order a2 . As usual, \"translation\" to the chiral effective lagrangian is done using\na spurion analysis. Here the spurions are needed to restore both chiral symmetry\nand full valence\u2013sea symmetry. When expectation values are assigned to them, both\nthese symmetries are explicitly broken, cf. Eq. (6).\nIn Ref. [4] only one similar operator appears in the chiral lagrangian, because the\nsame Wilson-fermion action was assumed for both the valence and sea quarks. The\nsymmetry group is then SU(K + N|K) instead of (3), which implies7\n\u03b3vv = \u03b3vs = \u03b3ss . (partially quenched, Wilson)\n\n(8)\n\nWe will also consider mixed actions in which the valence quarks are of the GW\ntype, while the sea quarks are Wilson-like [4]. The exact chiral symmetry in the\nvalence sector (cf. Eq. (2)) implies \u03b3vv = \u03b3vs = 0 in Eq. (6). What survives is only\nthe term corresponding entirely to the sea sector,8 where chiral symmetry is still\nbroken at a 6= 0.\nFinally, when both valence and sea quarks are of the GW type, no such operators\ncan appear at all, and all three \u03b3's vanish, consistently with the enlarged symmetry\ngroup (for massless quarks)\n[SU(K|K)L \u00d7 SU(K|K)R ] \u00d7 [SU(N)L \u00d7 SU(N)R ] .\n\n(GW \u2212 GW)\n\n(9)\n\nOperators similar to those in Eq. (6) can appear only at order a2 m2 , with m \u223c mv \u223c\nms . At the level of the chiral lagrangian, they can be made by replacing the factors\nstr(Pv,s (\u03a3 \u2212 \u03a3\u2020 )) in Eq. (6) by str(Pv,s (\u03a3M\u2020 \u2212 M\u03a3\u2020 )), where M is now promoted to\na spurion field transforming like \u03a3.\nFor domain-wall fermions with a finite fifth dimension L5 , chiral symmetry is only\napproximate [15]. (A mixed action could result e.g. from choosing different values for\nL5 in the valence and sea sectors.) The ensuing chiral-symmetry violating effects can\n7\n\nThis corresponds to the operator with LEC W7\u2032 in Eq. (21) of Ref. [4]. The relevant spurions\nare B and C of Eq. (14) of Ref. [4]. Replacing the identity matrix I in that equation by Pv or Ps in\nall possible combinations leads to our Eq. (6).\n8\nThe corresponding operator is the one multiplying W7\u2032 in Eq. (40) of Ref. [4].\n\n5\n\n\fbe taken into account by adding separate spurions for the residual quark masses mv,s\nres\n[16, 17]. As long as mres is smaller than the explicit quark masses,9 again all such\noperators are of order a2 m2 .\nIn order to obtain tree-level meson propagators, we expand Lcont + \u03b4LW to\nquadratic order in the meson field \u03a6. It is useful to define separate singlet fields\nin the valence and sea sectors: the \"super-\u03b7 \u2032 \" \u03a6v0 of the valence-symmetry group\nSU(K|K) [18], and the \"dynamical\" singlet field \u03b7s\u2032 .

The singlet mass terms following from Eqs. (4,6) can now be\nwritten as\n1\n1\nLsinglet = \u03bc2vv (\u03a6v0 )2 + \u03bc2vs \u03a6v0 \u03b7s\u2032 + \u03bc2ss (\u03b7s\u2032 )2 ,\n(11)\n2\n2\nin which\n\u03bc2vv = \u03bc2 + \u03b3vv a2 ,\n\u03bc2vs = \u03bc2 + \u03b3vs a2 ,\n\u03bc2ss = \u03bc2 + \u03b3ss a2 .\n\n(12)\n\nThese scaling violations contain no derivatives, nor (for Wilson fermions) powers\nof the quark mass matrix. Hence they are part of the leading-order difference in\nthe chiral expansion between a mixed action at non-zero lattice spacing and its PQ\ncontinuum limit.\nBefore proceeding, we have a few comments. First, new operators as in Eq. (6)\nlead not only to order a2 contributions to singlet mass terms, but also to new O(a2 )\nvertices in the chiral lagrangian. In other words, chiral symmetry implies that Eq. (11)\ncannot appear as an isolated invariant term.10 Second, while other operators appear\nat order a2 in the chiral lagrangian [4], all the quadratic terms are of the form\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\na2 \u03b2v str(Pv \u03a62 ) + \u03b2s str(Ps \u03a62 ) ,\n\n(13)\n\nwith \u03b2v,s linear combinations of order a2 LECs.11 They do not contribute any singlet\nmass terms, i.e. terms as in Eq. (11).\nWith our quark mass matrix (5), all pions made out of valence quarks are degenerate with a common mass Mvv , and, similarly, pions made out of sea quarks all\nhave a common mass Mss with, in general, Mss 6= Mvv . Here Mvv denotes the mass\nof a charged valence meson, i.e. a meson made out of a quark and an anti-quark of\n9\n\nIf L5 is chosen so small (e.g. L5 = 2) that the residual masses, and, hence, the actual quark\nmasses are substantially bigger than the explicit quark-mass parameters, domain-wall fermions\nshould be treated as Wilson-like.\n10\nWe thank Claude Bernard for very useful discussions on this point.\n11\nIn the GW-valence, Wilson-sea case, \u03b2s is a linear combination of W6\u2032 and W8\u2032 in Eq. (40) of\nRef. [4].\n\n6\n\n\fdifferent flavors. At tree level, these meson masses are given by [4]12\n2\nMvv\n= 2B0v mv + 2W0v a + 2\u03b2v a2 + O(am, m2 , a3 ) ,\n2\nMss\n= 2B0s ms + 2W0s a + 2\u03b2s a2 + O(am, m2 , a3 ) ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere B0v \u2212 B0s = O(a2 ). The LECs W0v or W0s vanish if one works with an order-a\nimproved action in the valence or sea sector. The terms of order a and a2 both vanish\nif one uses fermions of the GW type. A key observation is that, at tree level, the\noperators in \u03b4LW only contribute to singlet mass terms, as in Eq. (11). The LECs\n\u03b3vv,vs,ss do not appear in the tree-level expressions for the meson masses Mvv,ss .\nWe obtain the tree-level two-point function Gi,j = h\u03a6ii \u03a6jj i for the neutral valence\nmeson fields as\nGi,j (p) =\n\n2\n\u03bc2vv (p2 + Mss\n) + N(\u03bc2vv \u03bc2ss \u2212 \u03bc4vs )\n\u03b4ij\n\u2212\n,\n2\n2 )2 (p2 + M 2 + N\u03bc2 )\np2 + Mvv\n(p2 + Mvv\nss\nss\n\n(15)\n\nwhere the indices i and j correspond to the flavor of the valence quark. Since the\n2\neffective theory is based on a combined expansion in Mvv,ss\n\u223c p2 and a2 , treating \u03bc2\nas a quantity of order one in this expansion, we can simplify this expression to leading\norder in these parameters by using Eq. (12). We obtain13\n1\nGi,j (p) = \u03b4ij \u2212\nN\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n2\n2\n(Mss\n\u2212 Mvv\n)/N + (\u03b3vv + \u03b3ss \u2212 2\u03b3vs )a2\n1\n\u2212\n,\n2\n2 )2\np2 + Mvv\n(p2 + Mvv\n\n(16)\n\nIndeed, \u03bc2 disappears from the propagator, consistent with the fact that in a PQ\ntheory \u03a60 = str(\u03a6) can be constrained to vanish [20]. Setting \u03a60 = 0 implies that\n\u03b7s\u2032 = \u2212\u03a6v0 , and thus Lsinglet goes over into\nLsinglet \u2192\n\n1 2\na (\u03b3vv + \u03b3ss \u2212 2\u03b3vs )(\u03a6v0 )2 .\n2\n\n(17)\n\nThis simplified singlet mass term directly leads to Eq. (16). Setting str(\u03a6) = 0 also\nremoves terms of the form \u03a60 str(Pv,s (\u03a3\u2212\u03a3\u2020 )), (\u2202\u03bc \u03a60 )2 , etc., so that we were justified\nin not considering such terms in Eq. (6).\nFrom Eq. (16), we learn that in a mixed-action theory, double poles may arise from\ntwo different sources. One is well known from PQ QCD. It has a residue proportional\nto the difference between valence- and sea-meson's mass-squared. In addition, at nonzero lattice spacing, a new term proportional to a2 appears in the residue. This new\nterm arises because scaling violations in the valence, sea and mixed double hairpins\nare different for such theories, and thus \u03b3vv + \u03b3ss \u2212 2\u03b3vs will in general not vanish.\nOf course, if we use the same lattice fermions for both valence and sea sectors, we\nrecover the PQ case in which this new contribution to the residue does vanish, cf.\nEq. (8).\n12\n\nWe assume that 1/a divergences have been absorbed into mv,s . We also assume that we are\nclose to, but outside the Aoki phase [19].\n13\n2\nNote that we do not specify the relative size of Mvv,ss\nand a2 .\n\n7\n\n\fTo the order we work, it is possible to tune the residue of the double pole to\nzero by adjusting the valence quark mass. A vanishing residue would be obtained by\nchoosing the valence quark mass mv such that the residue,\n2\n2\nR = (Mss\n\u2212 Mvv\n)/N + a2 (\u03b3vv + \u03b3ss \u2212 2\u03b3vs ) ,\n\n(18)\n\nvanishes. Alternatively, one could tune the valence quark mass such that Mvv = Mss .\nAt non-zero lattice spacing, these two choices are different. In other words, while also\nthe meson masses are afflicted by scaling violations (cf. Eq. (14)), there are scaling\nviolations in the double pole which do not get absorbed into the meson masses. If one\nchooses to tune the valence quark mass such as to set R = 0, obviously this requires\na quantity sensitive to the singlet part of the \u03b7 \u2032 mass-squared, N\u03bc2 .\nOur analysis does not apply to any mixed action involving staggered fermions.\nMixed actions with only staggered or GW-type fermions have no order-a scaling\nviolations. Order-a2 scaling violations associated with symmetry breaking can only\ncome from the breaking of taste symmetry in the staggered-fermion sector. As a\nresult, all the order-a2 scaling violations in the double pole can be related to the\norder-a2 mass splittings between the staggered pseudo-scalar mesons [5]. For mixed\nactions with staggered and/or GW-type fermions, scaling violations that cannot be\nabsorbed into the Goldstone-meson masses occur in the residue of the double pole\nonly at order a2 m2 .\n\n3\n\nExamples of quantities with enhanced scaling violations\n\nThe occurrence of a double pole in neutral-meson propagators leads to an enhanced\nsensitivity of many quantities to the meson masses [18, 21, 7, 22] or to the volume\n[6, 8, 23]. This implies ipso facto an enhanced sensitivity to scaling violations of such\nquantities because of the presence of the LECs \u03b3vv,ss,vs . In this section we discuss\nexamples of such quantities, in particular the I = 0 pion scattering length [6] and the\ntwo-point function for the I = 1 scalar meson a0 [7, 22].\nThe oldest examples of enhanced sensitivity due to the double pole are the enhanced (\"quenched\") chiral logarithms in Goldstone meson masses, decay constants,\nand the chiral condensate [18, 21]. However, for quark masses used in typical simulations, these effects are numerically very small; the same is expected to be true for the\nscaling violations present in Eq. (16). A more interesting quantity is the shift in the\nenergy of two pions, both at rest in an I = 0 state, in a finite spatial volume L3 with\nperiodic boundary conditions. In quantities like this, the presence of a double pole\ngives rise to enhancement of finite-volume effects [6]. It is therefore a priori not clear\nwhat the combined effect is of enhancement by powers of L in addition to suppression\nby powers of a.\nThe two-pion I = 0 energy shift is given by [6]\n1\n\u2206EI=0\n7\u03c0\n1\n1\n2\n1\n\u2212\nA0 (Mvv L)\u03b4\u01eb + O(\u01eb2 ) ,\n=\u2212 2\n+\nB\n(M\nL)\u03b4\n+\n0\nvv\n2Mvv\n8f Mvv L3 2\n2\nN\n8\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(19)\n\n\fin which\n\n2\nMvv\nR\n,\n\u01eb\n\u2261\n,\n(20)\n8\u03c0 2 f 2\n16\u03c0 2 f 2\nand R is defined in Eq. (18). The first term is the leading-order, tree-level result,\nwhile the other terms come from one-loop diagrams. We adapted the result of Ref. [6]\nto the PQ case, resulting in the extra \u22121/N appearing in the A0 term.14\nThe large-L expansions of the coefficient functions B0 and A0 are given by15\n\n\u03b4\u2261\n\n5z(3) 5z(2) 2\u03c0 2\n2\u03c0\nB0 (ML) = \u2212\n+\n+O\n2\n2\n8\u03c0\n32\u03c0\nML\nML\n\u00132\n\u00133 !\n\u0012\n\u0012\n2\u03c0\n3z(2) 2\u03c0\n,\n+O\nA0 (ML) =\n2\n4\u03c0\nML\nML\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n\u00133 !\n\n,\n\n(21)\n\nin which z(3) and z(2) are geometrical constants,\nz(3) = 8.40192397 ,\n\nz(2) = 16.53231596 .\n\n(22)\n\nWe only showed the terms that generate enhanced finite-volume corrections to the\nleading-order result. These corrections are unphysical, and are absent if exactly the\nsame lattice-fermion action is used in the valence and sea sectors (with valence-quark\nmasses equal to sea-quark masses). When a mixed action is used, if one does not\ntune mv to make the residue in Eq. (18) vanish, \u2206EI=0 would be afflicted by scaling\nviolations. (As already explained, this is true even if mv is tuned to set Mvv = Mss .)\nThe enhanced scaling violations are of order Mvv a4 L3 \u039b6QCD (from the leading term in\nB0 ), respectively Mvv a2 L\u039b2QCD (from the leading term in A0 ), relative to the physical\nvalue (estimating f \u223c \u039bQCD and \u03b3vv,vs,ss \u223c \u039b4QCD ). There are additional four-point\nvertices of order a2 which contribute to these one-loop terms in \u2206EI=0 , that were\nnot taken into account in Ref. [6]. However, they will not lead to any parametrically\nlarger contributions than the ones considered here.\nIt is instructive to consider these results in view of various power-counting schemes\nproposed in the literature. Ref. [4] considered an expansion with a single small pa2\nrameter (compare Eq. (20)) \u01eb \u223c Mvv,ss\n/\u039b2 \u223c p2 /\u039b2 \u223c a\u039bQCD . Assuming Mvv L \u226b 1\nand Mvv = Mss , the first term of Eq. (19) is of order \u01eb/(Mvv L)3 , the second term\nis of order \u01eb4 , while the third term is of order \u01eb3 /(Mvv L)2 . If we would ignore the\nenhancement of the second and third terms by positive powers of Mvv L relative to\nthe first term, these terms would be of higher order compared to the O(\u01eb2 ) term in\nEq. (19) and the O(\u01eb2 ) terms considered in Ref. [4]. (This is consistent with the fact\n2\n2\nthat, with this power counting, the a2 term in R is of higher order than the Mss\n\u2212Mvv\n2\nterm.) In a different scheme [24], (a\u039bQCD ) is taken to be of order \u01eb. In that case,\nthe second and third terms in Eq. (19) are both of order \u01eb2 . Again they are enhanced\n(by (Mvv L)3 , respectively Mvv L) relative to the other O(\u01eb2 ) terms in Eq. (19).\nFor parameters used in realistic simulations, the volume-enhanced unphysical\neffects may nevertheless turn out to be rather small. For instance, setting aMvv \u223c 0.2,\n14\n\n2\nIn the fully quenched case, which corresponds to taking Mss\n\u2192 \u221e in Eq. (15), the corresponding\nfactor is equal to one.\n15\nThis corrects a mistake in B0 (M L) in Eq. (18) of Ref. [6].\n\n9\n\n\fa\u039bQCD \u223c 0.1 and L/a = 32 leads to scaling violations of about 0.7% (from B0 (Mvv L))\nand 6% (from A0 (Mvv L)), relative to the first, physical term in Eq. (19). Note that\nthe numerical coefficient of (Mvv L)\u22122 in A0 (Mvv L) is rather large, about 50.\nWe see that, if Wilson-like fermions are used in the valence and/or sea sectors, the\nunphysical effects in \u2206EI=0 are expected to be rather small in realistic simulations,\nalthough probably not entirely negligible. Of course, better knowledge of \u03b3vv + \u03b3ss \u2212\n2\u03b3vs is needed in order to move beyond our crude estimates.\nAs explained earlier, when GW fermions with exact chiral symmetry are employed\nin both the valence and sea sectors, the scaling violations (in R) are further suppressed\nby a factor of order (m/\u039bQCD )2 . Thus, the unphysical effects will be negligibly small\nif the quark masses are light enough. The same is true for domain-wall fermions,\nprovided the residual mass is not larger than typical explicit quark masses (as easily\naccomplished in current simulations).\nAnother quantity which may be strongly afflicted by the double pole is the I = 1\nscalar (a0 ) two-point function [7]. This effect was considered in the PQ theory [22],\nwhich we will generalize to the mixed-action case. We note that the sensitivity of the\na0 two-point function was used to tune a mixed action theory to the full unquenched\nQCD limit in Ref. [25]. However, the scaling violations present in the double pole,\nEq. (16), were not considered in that study.\nThe I = 1 scalar two-point correlator at vanishing spatial momentum was calculated in the PQ theory [22]. Adapting that result to our case, the dominant contribution for large time t is given by16\n\u0011\nB 2 e\u22122Mvs t N\ne\u22122Mvv t 1 \u0010 2\n2\nC(t) \u2192 03\n(M\n+\nM\n)/N\n+\nRM\nt\n.\n\u2212\nvv\nvv\nss\n2\n2\n2\n2L\nMvs\n2\nMvv\nMvv\n#\n\n\"\n\n(23)\n\nAgain, R is the residue of the double pole (no particular assumption on the value\n2\n2\nof Mss\n\u2212 Mvv\nis made). Mvs is the mass of a meson made out of a valence and a\n2\n2\n2\nsea quark, with Mvs\n= (Mvv\n+ Mss\n)/2 to leading order. We have assumed that the\n2\n\u2032\n2\n, as well as the a0 mass, are much heavier\nmass of the \u03b7s , given by M\u03b7\u2032 = N\u03bc2 + Mss\nthan any Goldstone-meson mass. For large enough t the linear term in t dominates.\n(Depending on the actual values of the M's and \u03b3's in Eq. (18), C(t) could even\nbecome negative.) Setting Mvv = Mss reduces Eq. (23) to\nB02 e\u22122Mvv t\nC(t) \u2192\n2\n2L3 Mvv\n\nN\n2\n(\u03b3vv + \u03b3ss \u2212 2\u03b3vs )a2 t\n\u2212\n\u2212\n2\nN\nMvv\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(24)\n\nThe coefficient of the factor linear in t (measured in lattice units) is of order (a\u039bQCD )4 /\n(aMvv ), which is again quite small for a typical simulation. (In the special case N = 2\nthe first two terms in Eq. (24) cancel each other, and the last term should be compared\nwith the a0 and \u03b7 \u2032 terms which are present in the full correlator.)\n16\n\nOur LEC B0 corresponds to 2\u03bc0 of Ref. [22], and our \u03bc2 corresponds to m20 /3.\n\n10\n\n\f4\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have investigated two quantities which are expected to be particularly sensitive to\nthe unphysical effects resulting from a mixed lattice-QCD action. We have assumed\nthat there is no problem of principle, i.e. we have assumed that all such effects are\nencoded in scaling violations. Still, it is important to estimate their numerical size for\nrealistic choices of MC simulation parameters. Using effective field theory techniques,\nbuilding on the work of Refs. [3, 4], we identified the double pole in the flavor-neutral\nGoldstone meson propagators as the most infrared-sensitive probe of these effects.\nWe considered two examples of observables where the double-pole scaling violations are parametrically enhanced, either by powers of Mvv L (i.e. of the spatial size)\nin the case of I = 0 two-pion energy shifts, or linearly with euclidean time t in the\ncase of the a0 propagator. We found that these scaling violations are likely to be\nrather small in currently realistic simulations. While this is good news for anyone\ninterested in using mixed actions, care should be taken to monitor their size in practice. Indeed, for the two-pion energy shift the effect-while small-is not negligible\nalready according to our crude estimate, if a Wilson-like action is used in the sea\nand/or valence sector.\nThe magnitude of these scaling violations depends on the observable in question.\nIt could well be that other interesting observables exist for which the effect is larger.\nAs another example, let us mention the nucleon-nucleon potential, where the contribution from one-pion exchange is given by a Yukawa potential. In PQ QCD with\nunequal valence- and sea-quark masses, the long-distance part of the potential gets\nan additional contribution from the double pole through \u03b7 exchange [26].17 Including\nthe scaling violations of Eq. (16) leads to a potential of the form\nV (r) =\n\n1\n2 \u03c4(1) * \u03c4(2)\n2 R\n\u03c3\n*\n\u2207\n\u03c3\n*\n\u2207\ng\n\u2212\ng\n(1)\n(2)\nA\n0\n8\u03c0f 2\nr\nMvv\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\ne\u2212Mvv r ,\n\n(25)\n\nwhere we took N = 2. Here gA (g0 ) is the I = 1 (I = 0) axial coupling. The\nindices (1) and (2) refer to the two nucleons, the \u03c3's to spin and the \u03c4 's to isospin.\nThe second, unphysical term clearly dominates the first term at large distances. The\nnucleon-\u03b7 coupling g0 is poorly known, but it could be larger than gA , thus decreasing\nthe distance at which the unphysical term sets in.\nIf lattice fermions satisfying the GW relation (or approximations thereof such as\ndomain-wall fermions with finite fifth extent) are used in both the valence and sea\nsectors, chiral symmetry leads to an extra suppression of the unphysical mixed-action\neffects, by a factor of order (m/\u039bQCD )2 .\nWe conclude with a practical comment. For Goldstone-meson masses in the few\n100 MeV range, one has Mvv /\u039bQCD \u223c Mss /\u039bQCD = O(1). In comparison, (a\u039bQCD )2 =\nO(0.01). Therefore, when Wilson-like fermions are involved, one might have to control\n2\n2\nthe difference Mvv\n\u2212 Mss\nat the few percent level in order to be able to single out\nthe scaling-violations part of the residue R. This is likely to require the use of an\nobservable with enhanced sensitivity to the double pole. If both sea and valence\n17\n\nWe thank Paulo Bedaque for reminding us of this example of quenching effects.\n\n11\n\n\ffermions are of the GW type and the quark masses are small enough, the effect could\nbe too small to be detected.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Oliver B\u00e4r, Paulo Bedaque, Claude Bernard and Steve Sharpe for helpful discussions.
