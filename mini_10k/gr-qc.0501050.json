Xavier 524, Rio\nde Janeiro, RJ\nMaracan\u00e3, CEP:20550-003 , Brasil.\nE-Mail.: garcia@dft.if.uerj.br\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nRecently Hehl and Obukhov (HO) [1] have proposed a pre-metric electrodynamics where the metric would be oobtained from constitutive relations of\nelectrodynamics. Here we consider an alternative approach to a geometrical\nelectrodynamics where instead of obtained the metric from the constitutive\nelectrodynamice equations we obtain the Maxwell's equation in vacuum from\nteleparallel theory , in much the same way Einstein and Cartan dreammed\nto obtained as such unified field theory [2] , where the metric coefficients\nwould be obtained from the electrodynamics potential, unifying in this way\nthe concepts of gravitational and electromagnetic potentials. The metric\nis in fact is considered as a e.m perturbation of flat Minkowski spacetime.\nIn the case of Riemannian electrostatics we show that it reduces from the\nRiemann-flat or Minkowskian vacuum electrodynamics in the case of linear\nelectrodynamics. The case the Riemann tensor does not vanish we obtain a\nnonvacuum electrostatic where the Riemann curvature tensor would represent the density of charge. Actually we show that the Einstein equations in\nvacuum reduce to the trivial Minkowskian electrodynamics from the static\nmetric representing this electrostatic spacetime. Another interesting feature\nof this spacetime geometry is that a singularity in the metric g00 = 0 or an\nevent horizon may appear in the theory similar to what happens in Novello et al [3] black holes in flowing dielectric effective metric in Riemannian\nspacetime. The main difference here being that we are in vacuum and our\nmetric is not written in terms of the electric and magnetic fields but actually\nin terms of electric and magnetic potentials. Besides in Novello's approach\nthe effective metric depends on the nonlinear electric fields and not on the\nnonlinear e.m potentials as here. Since the generalization to higher dimensions is straightforward to simplify matters we consider that the electric and\nmagnetic potentials are unidimensional in space. We are not proposing an\nalternative electrodynamics to HO electodynamics but actually some simple and very pedestrian approach of obtained Maxwell's theory from the\nstationary electromagnetic and electrostatic metrics from non-Riemannian\ngeometry. Teleparallel electrodynamics have also been proposed by V. de\nAndrade and J. Pereira [4], however in their theory of electrodynamics no\ne.m effective metric is proposed. The term effective metric [5] here is used in\nthe context that the potentials in the metric maybe not necessarilly consider\nto represent the e.m potentials but simply mathematical functions and yet\n2\n\n\fin this case gravitational equations electromagneticeffective geometry could\nbe consider. Note also that no attempt is made here to think on a analogy to\nthe Einstein-Cartan theory [6] of gravity since no spin is consider here and we\nwork with teleparallel theory in vacuum. The alternative interpretation here\nof treating the electrodynamics here as an electromagnetic effective geometry\nwas actually proposed by Visser recently [5] either in the context of HO linear\nelectrodynamics or in Novello's nonlinear electrodynamics [5]. The effective\ntorsion here is analogous to the electric field in much the similar way as the\nacoustic torsion [7] recently introduced in the literature is analogous to the\nrotational of the vortex hydrodynamical flow in superfluids [8, 9]. Recently\nwe also have show that an effective torsion [10] appears in non-Riemannian\ngeometrical approach to the Lense-Thirring rotational of superfluids. It is\nalso important to stress that our theory is not a Einstein-Maxwell type theory\nof e.m on a gravitational general relativistic background but actually it represents a true geometrical unification of the gravitational and the e.m fields.\nThe paper is organised as follows: In section 2, the teleparallel T4 theory of\neffective electrodynamice is proposed, in section 3 the Riemannian electrodynamics is developed and finally in section 4 conclusions and discussions\nare undertaken.\n\n2\n\nTeleparallel effective geometry in electrodynamics\n\nIn the Einstein-Cartan spirit, teleparallel theories have been used in the past\nnot as a theory of the role of spin in gravity [11] but rather as a theory where\ntorsion could be used in some way to be related to the e.m field tensor. Our\nmetric as we shall see can be consider as a much simplified form of the Finsler\nmetric which geodesics represent the motion of charged particles and given\nby [12]\n1\ne\nds2 = [(gik dxi dxk ) 2 + Ai dxi ]2\n(1)\nm\nwhere (i, j = 0, 1, 2) and the Ai are the e.m potentials that here we split\nas \u03c6 = \u03c6(t, x) as the electric potential and Ax (t, x) as part of the magnetic\n~ The metric consider here which generates the effective\nvector potential A.\n\n3\n\n\f(2 + 1) \u2212 dimensional electrodynamics is given by\nds2 = (1 \u2212 \u03c62 )dt2 \u2212 (1 \u2212 Ax 2 )dx2 \u2212 dy 2\n\n(2)\n\nNote that this metric can be obtained as a metric perturbation of the Minkowskian\n(2 + 1) dimensional metric ds2 = dt2 \u2212 dx2 \u2212 dy 2 where the metric perturbation components are given by h00 = \u2212\u03c62 , hxx = \u2212Ax 2 and htx = \u2212\u03c6Ax ,\nothers zero, and the whole spacetime effective metric would be gik = \u03b7ik + hik\nwhere \u03b7ik represents the M4 Minkowski spacetime metric. Before we make\nuse of Cartan calculus [13] of differential forms to compute the effective Cartan torsion in terms of the electric field, we express the metric (2) in the\nform\nds2 = (\u03c9 0)2 \u2212 (\u03c9 1)2 \u2212 (\u03c9 2 )2 \u2212 (\u03c9 3 )2\n(3)\nwhere the basis frame one-form \u03c9 a where a = 0, 1, 2, 3 , are given by\n\u03c9 0 = dt\n\n(4)\n\n\u03c9 1 = dx\n\n(5)\n\n\u03c9 2 = dy\n\n(6)\n\n\u03c9 3 = \u03c6dt + Ax dx\n\n(7)\n\nNote that although we use four indices in differential forms the spacetime is\n(2 + 1) \u2212 dimensional. A similar metric has been used by Letelier [14] in the\ncontext of the teleparallel spacetime defects. This metric has been recently\ngeneralized to Riemann-Cartan spacetime [15]. By performing the exterior\nderivatives of the basis one-forms one obtains\nT 3 = d\u03c9 3 = T 3 tx dt\u2227dx = [\u2212\u2202x \u03c6 + \u2202t Ax ]dt\u2227dx\n\n(8)\n\nwhere the symbol \u2227 means the exterior product of differential forms [16] and\nuse has been made of the Cartan's first structure equation\nT a = d\u03c9 a + \u03c9 a b \u2227\u03c9 b\n\n(9)\n\nwhere T a represents the Cartan torsion two-form while \u03c9 a stands for the\nconnection one-form. We also use the choice of the orthonormal frame basis\nwhere \u03c9 a b vanishes which by the second Cartan's structure equation\nRa b = Ra bcd \u03c9 c \u2227\u03c9 d = d\u03c9 ab + \u03c9 a e \u2227\u03c9 e b\n4\n\n(10)\n\n\fimplies that the teleparallel constraint of the vanishing of the RiemannCartan tensor Ra bcd is obeyed. Note that the expression (9) allows us to\nidentify Cartan effective torsion with the effective electric field, as\nEx (t, x) = T 3 tx = [\u2212\u2202x \u03c6 + \u2202t Ax ]\n\n(11)\n\nThis identification is possible since the RHS of equation (11) represents in\nthree dimensions the electric vector field definition\n~\n~ = \u2212\u2207\u03c6 + \u2202 A\nE\n\u2202t\n\n(12)\n\n~ are respectively identified with the corresponding electric\nas long as \u03c6 and A\nand magnetic potentials. Thus we may conclude that the only nonvanishing\ntorsion component can be considered as an effective torsion in this nonRiemannian framework of electrodynamics.\n\n3\n\nRiemannian electrodynamics from an effective static metric\n\nSince the teleparallelism is usually seen as a way of expressing the Riemannian Einsteinian gravity (general relativity) theory in terms of torsion , in\nthe this section we shall address the particular case of a static effective metric\nobtained from the line element (2) in the case the magnetic potential vanishes, or in the absence of magnetic fields where the electric field turns to\nbe an electrostatic field. We could call this an effective static eletromagnetic\nline element\nds2 = (1 \u2212 \u03c62 )dt2 \u2212 dx2 \u2212 dy 2\n(13)\nThis simple metric yields the following components to Riemann, Ricci and\nEinstein tensors\n[(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c63 )\u2202x Ex \u2212 Ex 2 ]\n(14)\nR0101 =\n(\u22121 + \u03c62 )\nR11\n\nR00\n[(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c63 )\u2202x Ex \u2212 Ex 2 ]\n=\n=\n(\u22121 + \u03c62 )\n(\u22121 + \u03c62 )2\n\nG22 = G33\n\n[(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c63 )\u2202x Ex \u2212 Ex 2 ]\n=\n(\u22121 + \u03c62 )\n5\n\n(15)\n(16)\n\n\fwhile the Ricci scalar is\nR = \u22122\n\n[(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c63 )\u2202x Ex \u2212 Ex 2 ]\n(\u22121 + \u03c62 )\n\n(17)\n\nFrom there Riemannian curvature expressions one notes that the Einstein\nvacuum equations\nRab = 0\n(18)\nimplies the following equation\n[(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c63 )\u2202x Ex \u2212 Ex 2 ](\u22121 + \u03c62 ) = 0\n\n(19)\n\nFrom this expression we notice that in the linear electric field approximation\nEx 2 we have that\n(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c63 )\u2202x Ex = 0\n(20)\nwhich is equivalent to the Coulomb law of effective electrostatic \u2202x Ex = 0 or\n~ = 0. But note that substitution of this Coulomb law\nin 3 \u2212 dimensions \u2207.E\ninto the curvature expression (14) yields that the curvature vanishes and we\nare left with the a flat spacetime effective electrostatic ,while if one considers\nthat the the Einstein vacum equation is not obeyed here the Coulomb law\nbecomes\n(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c63 )\u2202x Ex\n(21)\nR0101 =\n(\u22121 + \u03c62 )\nNote that in this case the Riemann curvature tensor would be proportional to\na charge density and we are left with a linear electrodynamics in the electric\nfield but where the charge density is generated by the nonlinear electrostatic\npotentials. Note that for a Coulombian electrostatic field with bound charges\n,the asymptotic behaviour of the electrostatic field would give that \u03c63 << \u03c6\nand (21) can be approximated to\nR0101 =\n\n\u03c6\u2202x Ex\n(\u22121 + \u03c62 )\n\n(22)\n\nNote that in this case the horizon would imply a divergence in the Riemann\ntensor. This as in Schwarzschild case does not imply a true singularity,\nlike in astrophysical and optical black holes [17] one has to compute the\nKrestschmann curvature invariant\nR01tx R01tx = \u2212\n\n\u03c62 \u2202x Ex\n\u2202x Ex\n=\n<\u221e\n2\n(1 \u2212 3\u03c6 )\n2\n6\n\n(23)\n\n\fand we note that there is no physical singularity in the effective electrodynamic black hole horizon as in Schwarzschild black hole. Here we use the\nfact that at the effective black hole horizon \u03c6 = 1. The reader can easily\ncompute the inverse case of magnetic metric where the electrostatic potential\nvanishes and we are left with a magnetostatic effective metric. The effective\nblack hole considered here could be called an analog electrostatic black hole.\nAnalog black holes in flowing dielectrics have been previously obtained by\nNovello et al [3] in the context of nonlinear electrodynamics.\n\n7\n\n\f4\n\nDiscussions and Conclusions\n\nWe present here a non-Riemannian teleparallel framework for effective electrodynamics. A analog electrostatic Riemannian effective black hole has been\nobtained on the linear electrodynamics similar to the one obtained by Novello\net al [3] in the context of flowing dielectrics in Riemannian effective spacetime. Future perspectives may involve the generalization of these ideas to\ninclude matter in an effective way and compare this sort of post-metric e.m\ntheory with the pre-metric electrodynamics.\n\nReferences\n[1] F.W.
