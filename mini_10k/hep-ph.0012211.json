In all\nthese fields, investigations were presented about nontrivial topological configurations. In QCD such configurations are believed to be related to the nontrivial\nstructure of the QCD vacuum and to the confinement mechanism 1,2,3,4,5 on\none hand and to the breaking of the chiral symmetry 6,3,7 on the other hand.\nHowever, the QCD dynamics is extremely complicate and in order to test our\nunderstanding of the topological configurations, we need a systematic and under control way of parameterize the low energy physics in a frame that can still\nbe simply related to the real experiments and/or to the lattice experiments9 .\nIt is the aim of my talk to show how this is possible and in which physical\nsituations.\n2\n\nHeavy Quark Bound States\n\nHeavy-quark bound systems are an ideal playground for theoretical ideas about\nstrong QCD. In fact, while light quarks are highly \"nonperturbative objects\",\nstrongly interacting with the vacuum and with a mass almost entirely dominated by chiral symmetry breaking (topological nontrivial) effects, heavy quarks\nbehave as \"external sources\" and thus as natural probes of the QCD vacuum.\nBeing heavy at least the quark mass scale m can be treated perturbatively:\nm \u226b \u039bQCD . \u039bQCD has here always to be understood as the scale at which\nnonperturbative effects become dominant. Furthermore, since the characteristic difference \u2206E between the energy levels is \u2206E \u226a m inside such systems,\nthey are nonrelativistic and can be described at leading order by the appropriate Schr\u00f6dinger equation. This gives origin, as usual in nonrelativistic bound\na Invited\n\ntalk given at the XVIII Autumn School \"Topology of Strongly Correlated Systems\",\nLisbon, Portugal, 8-13 October, 2000.\n\n1\n\n\f(0)\n\nV (r)\n(GeV)\n\n2\n\n1\n\n\u03a5\n\u03b7c \u03c8\n\n\u03a5\n\n\u03a5\n\u03c72 \u03c8\n\n\u03a5\n\u03c8\n\n0\n1\n\n2\n\nr(fm)\n\n-1\n\nFigure 1: rQQ\u0304 vs Cornell potential (from Ref.8 ).\n\nstate, to several dynamical scales below m: the relative momentum p \u223c mv\n(the inverse of which gives the characteristic spatial size r of the system), the\nenergy E \u223c mv 2 (the inverse of which gives the characteristic time T of the\nsystem). Here, v is the velocity of the heavy quark in the bound state. In\nQCD, v is in general a function of the whole dynamics, perturbative and nonperturbative, but still remains a small parameter, v \u226a 1, and thus the scales\nmentioned above turn out to be well separated and hierarchically ordered. It\nis well known that a technical (and quite hard) problem in bound state calculation is originated by the fact that such scales get entangled 10 . Thus, even\nin QED it turns out to be very useful to disentangle such scales. In QCD\nthis becomes a deeper and more conceptual issue, since we need to separate\nas much as possible the perturbative contributions ('hard' physics at the high\nscale) from the nonperturbative effects ('soft or ultrasoft' physics at the low\nscale). It is on these last contributions that we will eventually be in the position\nto use our knowledge about topologically nontrivial configurations.\nI will show here that in quarkonium physics the existence of different dynamical scales besides \u039bQCD\n\u2022 makes the calculations more complicate from a technical point of view;\n\u2022 however, it makes also possible to test the non-perturbative nature of the\nQCD vacuum at different levels of deepness.\nIn fact, heavy quark bound states provide a full set of probes that may explore different characteristic distances, from the small to the large distance\nregime, and different dynamical situations, thus providing insights into perturbative/non-perturbative factorization mechanisms. In Fig. 1 we show a phenomenological determination of the characteristic radius r of heavy quarkonia\nagainst the phenomenological QQ\u0304 potential. It is apparent that heavy quarkonia display a pattern of characteristic radii that extend from the perturbative\n2\n\n\f\u039bQCD \u223c t\n\u039bQCD \u223c loop\n\n11111111\n00000000\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n11111111\n00000000\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000\n11111111\n\nhF 2 (0)i\n\n\u03a5(1S), ...\n\nhF (t)F (0)i\n\nonium-onium, short range cc\u0304, bb\u0304, gluelumps, ...\n\nheig\n\nH\n\ndxA(x)\n\ni long range cc\u0304, bb\u0304, hybrids, glueballs, ...\n\nFigure 2: The more extended the physical object, the more sensitive to non-perturbative\nphysics.\n\nregion r \u226a \u039bQCD to the transition and the confinement region r \u226b \u039bQCD .\nFor ground state quarkonia (e.g. \u03a5(1S)) r \u226a 1/\u039bQCD : the scale 1/r is perturbative (this also implies that the binding potential is perturbative). For\nmost quarkonia r \u223c 1/\u039bQCD : the scale 1/r is nonperturbative. In order to\nbe able to perform a systematic study, we need a clean and under control\napproach that allows us to factorize and resum the perturbative physics at\nthe appropriate scale, leaving us with the appropriate parameterization of the\nnonperturbative physics at the low energy scale. This goal is achieved by constructing an effective field theory (EFT). The existence of a hierarchy of energy\nscales in quarkonium systems allows the construction of EFT with less and less\ndynamical degrees of freedom but completely equivalent to QCD. This leads\nultimately to a field theory derived quantum mechanical description of these\nsystems. We call potential nonrelativistic QCD (pNRQCD) the corresponding\nEFT. pNRQCD provides an unambiguous power counting in v which determines which operators are relevant at a given order of the expansion in v. We\nrefer to 11,10,12 for details about pNRQCD. Here, we concentrate on the nonperturbative contributions: depending on the extension of the 'probe' systems\nsuch contributions enter parameterized in a completely different way. This\nis precisely the interesting point that may allow us to understand something\nabout the QCD vacuum structure. In QCD we can never get completely rid of\nthe nonperturbative effects. However, I will show that a pattern like the one\nrepresented in Fig 2 is realized in the heavy quark bound state nonperturbative dynamics. If the spatial and temporal characteristic scales of the bound\nsystem are perturbative (i.e. if mv \u226b mv 2 \u226b \u039bQCD ), then nonperturbative\ncontributions arise only in the form of local gluon condensates which contribute\nto the energy levels. When the characteristic temporal scale starts to be dominated by \u039bQCD (mv 2 \u223c \u039bQCD ), then the nonperturbative contributions are\nencoded in nonlocal (time-dependent) gluon condensates. As soon as 1/\u039bQCD\nfalls between the spatial and the temporal scale (mv > \u039bQCD > mv 2 ), the\nnonperturbative nonlocal condensates enter the definition of the potential and\ngive origin to short distance (r < 1/\u039bQCD ) nonoperturbative corrections. At\n3\n\n\fthe end, when \u039bQCD is comparable to the spatial size (mv \u223c \u039bQCD ), the nonperturbative information is carried by bidimensional extended objects called\nWilson loops. The potential is given in terms of them. Quite interestingly, the\nWilson loop turns out to be the order parameter of confinement (in gluodynamics) and allows us to put in direct connection topological configurations\nand the heavy quark phenomenology.\nAs we see from Fig. 2, there are sufficient physical systems in nature to\ntest all these dynamical situations.\n3\n\nNonrelativistic quark bound states with a small characteristic\nradius: Condensates\n\nFor heavy quark bound systems for which the following hierarchy m \u226b mv \u226b\nmv 2 >\n\u223c \u039bQCD holds, we can sequentially integrate out in perturbation theory\nboth the hard scale m and the soft scale mv. Then v \u223c \u03b1s . We denote by\nR \u2261 (x1 + x2 )/2 the center of mass of the QQ\u0304 system and by r \u2261 x1 \u2212 x2\nthe relative distance. Then at the scale of the 'matching' \u03bc\u2032 (mv \u226b \u03bc\u2032 \u226b\nmv 2 , \u039bQCD ) we have as still dynamical degrees of freedom: QQ\u0304 states with\nenergy of order of the next relevant scale, O(\u039bQCD , mv 2 ), momentum of order\nO(mv), plus ultrasoft gluons A\u03bc (R, t) with energy and momentum of order\nO(\u039bQCD , mv 2 ). Therefore only very low energy gluons remain in the EFT as\ndynamical degrees of freedom: they are multipole expanded. We find convenient\nto decompose the QQ\u0304 state into a singlet S(R, r, t) and an octet O(R, r, t) with\nrespect to color transformations.

The Vj are potential matching\ncoefficients: they are in the EFT the correspondent to the usual notion of the\npotential. We call Vs and Vo the singlet and octet static matching potentials\nrespectively. The singlet sector of the Lagrangian gives rise to equations of motion of the Schr\u00f6dinger type, while the last line of (1) contains retardation (or\nnonpotential) effects that start at the NLO in the multipole expansion. At this\norder the nonpotential effects come from the singlet-octet and octet-octet interaction mediated by an ultrasoft chromoelectric field. Recalling that r \u2243 1/mv\nand that the operators count like the next relevant scale, O(mv 2 , \u039bQCD ), to the\n4\n\n\fpower of the dimension, it follows that each term in the pNRQCD Lagrangian\nhas a definite power counting. In the EFT language the potential is defined\nupon the integration of all the scales up to the ultrasoft scale mv 2 and thus if\n2\n\u039bQCD <\n\u223c mv the potential is given by a pure perturbative expansion in \u03b1s at\nall orders. The EFT gives us with (1) a precise prescription to calculate both\npotential and nonpotential contributions to the energy levels and to count their\nrelevance in power of \u03b1s . Nonpotential effects start only at order \u03b15s ln \u03bc\u2032 . At\nthis order (three loops) the static singlet potential starts to become sensitive\nto the infrared physics via a logarithmic dependence on \u03bc\u203211 . Such dependence\nis re-absorbed in a physical observable by non-potential contributions13 . Nonperturbative effects are purely of nonpotential nature and the leading ones are\ncarried by the chromoelectric field which mediates the singlet-octet interaction.\nFrom (1) the quarkonium energy levels have been calculated up to \u03b15s ln \u03bc\u2032 and\nare given by13\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\np2\nVs (\u03bc\u2032 ) Vs (\u03bc\u2032 )\n|nli\n+ Vs (\u03bc\u2032 ) +\n+\nm\nm\nm2\nZ\n\u221e\ng2\nb\n\u2032\nTF\ndt hn, l|reit(En \u2212Ho ) r|n, lihEa (t)\u03c6(t, 0)adj\n\u2212i\nab E (0)i(\u03bc ) (2)\n3Nc\n0\n\nEn,l,j = hnl|\n\nC 2 \u03b12\n\n2\n\n(0)\n\np\nF s\nand |n, li are the Coulomb wave funcwhere En = \u2212m 4n\n2 , Ho = m + Vo\ntions.

This is a well known nonperturbative\nparameter that can be calculated also inside QCD vacuum models 4,2 . Further nonperturbative corrections are still of nonpotential type and are suppressed. For quarkonium of a typical size smaller than 1/\u039bQCD , the most\nrelevant operator for the nonperturbative dynamics is the bilocal gluon conb\ndensate hEa (t)\u03c6(t, 0)adj\nab E (0)i, which belongs to the class of th non-local nona\nb\nperturbative gluon condensate hF\u03bc\u03bd\n(x)\u03c6(x, 0)adj\nab F\u03bb\u03c1 (0)i. Let me open a small\n5\n\n\fparenthesis by summarizing our knowledge of such operator and what model\nindependent information can be obtained by the EFT.\nDifferent parametrizations have been proposed 15,16,17,18 for the nonlocal\ngluon condensate. Because of its Lorentz structure, the correlator is in general\ndescribed by two form factors. A convenient choice of these consists in the\nchromoelectric and chromomagnetic correlators:\nb\nhEa (x)\u03c6(x, 0)adj\nab E (0)i ,\n\nb\nhBa (x)\u03c6(x, 0)adj\nab B (0)i.\n\nThe strength of the correlators is of the order of the gluon condensate. In the\nlong range (x2 \u2192 \u221e) they fall off exponentially (in the Euclidean space) with\nsome typical correlation lengths that can be measured on the lattice 16,17 . In\n16\ntwo different lengths have been obtained for the chromoelectric (TgE ) and\nthe chromomagnetic correlators (TgB ):\nTgE 6= TgB \u2243 0.1\u2013 0.2 fm (quenched).\n\n(4)\n\nA recent sum-rule calculation 19 gives TgE < TgB . The sum rule turns out not\nto be stable for the chromoelectric correlator, while for the chromomagnetic\ncorrelation length it gives\nTg B = 0.11+0.04\n\u22120.02 fm (quenched).\n\n(5)\n\nThe interesting thing is that these TgE and TgB , which control the form of the\nnonperturbative correction entering the energy levels, have a precise physical\ninterpretation. Their inverses correspond to the masses of the lowest-lying\nvector and pseudovector gluelumpsb , respectively. This can be explicitly seen\nin the short-range limit, r = |x| \u2192 0, where the hybrids operators can be\nexplicitly constructed 11,20 . The suitable effective field theory is pNRQCD in\nthe static limit. Gluelump operators are of the type Tr{OH}, where O = Oa T a\ncorresponds to a quark\u2013antiquark state in the adjoint representation (the octet)\nand H = H a T a is a gluonic operator. By matching the QCD static hybrid\noperators into pNRQCD, we get the static energies (also called potentials) of\nthe hybrids, which reduce to the gluelumps in the limit r \u2192 0. At leading\norder in the multipole expansion, they read\nVH (r) = Vo (r) +\n\n1\n+ O(r2 );\nTgH\n\nH\n\nb\nnon\u2212pert.\nhH a (t)\u03c6(t, 0)adj\n\u2243 h e\u2212it/Tg .\nab H (0)i\n\n(6)\nb The\n\ngluelump is a state formed by a QQ\u0304 pair in the adjoint representation plus a gluon, all\nin the same spatial point. They are measured on the lattice and their masses are, roughly\nspeaking, the limit of the hybrids static energies when the typical QQ\u0304 distance r goes to\nzero.\n\n6\n\n\fSince hybrids are classified in QCD according to the representations of D\u221e,h ,\nwhile in pNRQCD, where we have integrated out the length r, their classification is done according to the representations of O(3) \u00d7 C, the static hybrid\nshort-range spectrum is expected to be more degenerate than the long-range\none 11,20 . The lattice measure of the hybrid potentials done in 21 confirms this\nfeature. In 11 it has been shown that the quantum numbers attribution of\npNRQCD to the short-range operators, and the expected O(3) \u00d7 C symmetry\nof the effective field theory match the lattice measurements. By using only E\nand B fields and keeping only the lowest-dimensional representation we may\n\u2032\nidentify the operator H for the short-range hybrids called \u03a3+\ng (and \u03a0g ) with\nr * E (and r \u00d7 E) and the operator H for the short-range hybrids called \u03a3\u2212\nu\n(and \u03a0u ) with r * B (and r \u00d7 B). Hence, the corresponding static energies for\nsmall r are\nV\u03a3+ \u2032 ,\u03a0g (r) = Vo (r) +\ng\n\n1\n,\nTgE\n\nV\u03a3\u2212\n(r) = Vo (r) +\nu ,\u03a0u\n\n1\n.\nTgB\n\nThe lattice measure of 21 shows that, in the short range,V\u03a3+ \u2032 ,\u03a0 (r) > V\u03a3\u2212\n(r).\nu ,\u03a0u\ng\n\ng\n\nThis supports the sum-rule prediction 19 that the pseudovector hybrid lies lower\nthan the vector one, i.e. TgE < TgB .\nSumming up, the message is that, within the EFT, we can obtain quite\na number of model-independent information on the nonperturbative contributions to the energy levels which are carried by these nonlocal condensates\nand we can establish interesting relations between these objects and physical\n'nonperturbative' entities like the hybrids.\nLet us now briefly consider the situation when mv > \u039bQCD > mv 2 . The\ninfrared sensitivity of the quark\u2013antiquark static potential at three loops 11\nsignals that it may become sensitive to non-perturbative effects if the next\nrelevant scale after mv is \u039bQCD . Indeed, in the situation mv \u226b \u039bQCD \u226b\nmv 2 , the leading non-perturbative contribution (in \u03b1s and in the multipole\nexpansion) to the static potential reads 11\nZ\ng2\nr2 \u221e \u2212itCA \u03b1s /(2r) a\nb\n\u2032\nV0 (r)nonpert = \u2212i TF\ndt e\nhE (t)\u03c6(t, 0)adj\nab E (0)i(\u03bc ). (7)\nNc\n3 0\nThis term has to be summed to V0pert and it explicitly cancels the dependence\nof the perturbative static potential on the infrared scale \u03bc\u2032 . It is interesting to\nnote that the leading contribution in the \u039bQCD /mv 2 expansion of V non\u2212pert\n(obtained by putting the exponential equal to 1) cancels the order \u039b3QCD r2\nrenormalon that affects the static potential (the leading-order renormalon, of\norder \u039bQCD , cancels against the pole mass). Therefore, also in the renormalon\n7\n\n\flanguage, the above operator is the relevant non-perturbative contribution to\nthe static potential in the considered kinematic situation.\nThe nonperturbative terms in the potential are in this case organized in\npowers of \u03b1s /(r\u039bQCD ), starting with a quadratic term, r2 . The actual form\nof these short range nonperturbative corrections to the potential depends on\nthe actual form of the nonlocal correlator11. It is therefore very interesting to\ncalculate this object inside models of the QCD vacuum, or with topological\nconfigurations on the lattice, also in relation to the recent claim of violation of\nthe OPE expansion 'carried' by a nonperturbative short distance 'string' term\nin the static singlet potential2 .\n4\n\nNonrelativistic quark bound states with a large characteristic\nradius: Wilson loops\nFig. 1 shows that most of the quarkonia states lie in a region where the inverse\nof the size of the system is close to the scale \u039bQCD . In this situation the potential can no longer be expressed as an expansion in \u03b1s . The non-perturbative\ndynamics is already switched on at the binding (potential) scale and it is contained in more extended objects than (local or non-local) gluon condensates:\nWilson loops and chromoelectric and chromomagnetic field insertions on the\nWilson loops. Such operators can be eventually calculated on the lattice 23 or\nin QCD vacuum models 24,1 . In 22 the matching of QCD to pNRQCD has been\nperformed at order 1/m2 in the general situation \u039bQCD <\n\u223c mv. This has been\nproved to be equivalent to compute the heavy quarkonium potential at order\n1/m2 . More precisely, a pure potential picture emerges at the leading order\nin the ultrasoft expansion under the condition that all the gluonic excitations\n(hybrids) have a gap of O(\u039bQCD ) with respect to the singlet. Such situation\nis confirmed by lattice simulations23 . Then if we switch off the light fermions\n(pure gluodynamics), only the singlet survives and pNRQCD reduces to a\npure two-particle NR quantum-mechanical system. Therefore, the situation\nassumed by all potential models, may be now rigorously derived under a specific set of circumstances (for more details see22 ). In this situation, pNRQCD\ninvolves only a bilinear colour singlet field, S(x1 , x2 , t),\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2020\n(8)\nLpNRQCD = S i\u22020 \u2212 hs (x1 , x2 , p1 , p2 ) S,\nwhere hs is the Hamiltonian of the singlet, p1 = \u2212i\u2207x1 and p2 = \u2212i\u2207x2 . It\nhas the following expansion up to order 1/m2\nhs =\n\np21\np2\nV (1,0)\nV (0,1)\nV (2,0)\nV (0,2)\nV (1,1)\n+ 2 + V (0) +\n+\n+\n+\n+\n. (9)\n2\n2\n2m1\n2m2\nm1\nm2\nm1\nm2\nm1 m2\n8\n\n\fHigher order effects in the 1/m expansion as well as extra ultrasoft degrees of\nfreedom11,22,25 , such as hybrids and pions can be systematically included and\nmay eventually affect the leading potential picture (like in the perturbative\nregime ultrasoft gluons 11,22 ). We shall use the following notations: h. . .i will\nstand for the average over the Yang\u2013Mills action, W\u2737 for the rectangular static\nWilson loop of dimensions r \u00d7 T and hh. . .ii \u2261 h. . . W\u2737 i/hW\u2737 i. We define\nhhO1 (t1 )...On (tn )iic as the connected Wilson loop. We get in terms of Wilson\nloops 22\ni\nV (0) (r) = lim\nlnhW\u2737 i,\n(10)\nT \u2192\u221e T\nZ T\n1\n(1,0)\nV\n(r) = \u2212 lim\ndt t hhgE1 (t, x1 ) * gE1 (0, x1 )iic = V (0,1) (r).\n(11)\n2 T \u2192\u221e 0\n\nAll the obtained expression for the potentials are manifestly gauge invariant\nand are also correct at any power in \u03b1s in the perturbative regime. For the\nterms of order 1/m2 we have the general decomposition\nV (2,0) =\n\n(2,0)\n1 n 2 (2,0) o VL2 (r) 2\n(2,0)\np1 , Vp2 (r) +\nL1 + Vr(2,0) (r) + VLS (r)L1 * S1 , (12)\n2\nr2\n\nwhere Lj \u2261 r\u00d7pj . Similar definitions hold for V (0,2) and V (1,1) . All the potentials (i.e. the functions of r) in V (2,0) , V (0,2) , V (1,1) are obtained factorized in\ntwo contributions. The first one contains the hard physics at the scale m which\nis calculated as a series expansion in \u03b1s at the appropriate hard scale22,10 . The\nsecond contribution at the scale 1/r , enjoys a closed expression in terms of\naverage values of two or more chromoelectric and chromomagnetic insertions\nin the presence of the Wilson loop 22 , similarly to (10),(11). The explicit expressions can be found in 22 . Therefore, the calculation of the dynamics, i.e.\nthe calculation of the potential, is in this way reduced to a calculation in pure\ngluodynamics at the lowest scale. On one hand, such objects are very conveniently evaluated on the lattice since they are pure glue objects and contain\nonly one scale. On the other hand, such objects can be very well evaluated\nusing nontrivial topological configurations inside a model of the QCD vacuum\n24,1\n. We emphasize that, since the potential we get here is a well defined\nquantity, derived from QCD via a systematic and unambiguous procedure,\nand complete up to order 1/m2 , it is not affected by the usual ambiguities\n(ordering, retardation corrections, etc.), which affect all potential models and\nall phenomenological reductions of Bethe\u2013Salpeter kernels 9 . For the same\nreason the above results are the relevant ones for the study of the properties\nof the QCD vacuum in the presence of heavy sources. The average value of\nthe field insertions in the presence of the Wilson loop contain all the relevant\n9\n\n\finformation about the heavy quark dynamics. This is much more detailed and\nquantitative with respect to the generic request that topological configuration\nshould originate an area law behaviour into the Wilson loop. If we calculate\nthese field insertions on the Wilson loop using some dominant topological configurations we have then a simple procedure to relate the result, on one hand\nto standard lattice simulations of the same objects and, on the other hand,\ndirectly to the spectrum. This last feature descends from the fact that within\nthe EFT we are able to fully take into account the perturbative contributions\nand we have a clear power counting that selects the terms contributing at a\ngiven order in the v expansion.\n5\n\nTopology and heavy quark bound states\n\nThe outlined study is rigorous and allows a systematic disentanglement of\nthe high from the low energy scales of the heavy quarkonium system under\nstudy. In this specific sense also perturbative and nonperturbative effects turn\nout to be disentangled. Thus the nonrelativistic dynamics of heavy quark\nbound states is surely an adequate benchmark to test ideas and models of\nQCD topology and QCD vacuum structure.\nAs I have shown, when mv \u223c \u039bQCD , then the whole nonperturbative QQ\u0304\ninteraction at order 1/m2 turns out to be expressed in terms of average values\nof Wilson loops and field insertions into the Wilson loop. We know that in the\nconfined phase the Wilson loop is dominated by an area law9 which is related\nto the formation of an interquark confining flux tube27 . Such feature has been\nobtained using different topological configurations: gluon Abelian projected\nfields2 , monopoles2 , center vortices5 . In all these cases an approximated area\nlaw is obtained and it is debated what are the relevant topological configurations that really drive the confinement dynamics. Many lattice investigations\nhave been performed and have ended up with the notion that in a way all\nthese topological configurations are related26 . Several QCD vacuum models\nexist in the literature15,1,24,9 and all of them obtain an area law for the Wilson\nloop. However, there are quite a number of differences between different vacuum models as well as between different topological configurations, but such\ndifferences are not apparent at the level of the static Wilson loop. In this\ncase, typically we need only one parameter, the string tension \u03c3, to encode the\ninformation of a constant energy density in the confining flux tube. However,\nthere are many ways in which this can be realized in relation to the actual\nprofile of the flux tube. It is well known for example that while the QQ\u0304 flux\ntube measured on the lattice in QCD is quite fat, the one measured on the\nlattice in the Abelian projection is very thin28 .\n10\n\n\fOn the other hand in order to describe the nonperturbative heavy quark\ndynamics at order 1/m2 we need not only the Wilson loop area law behaviour\nbut also the behaviour of the chromoelectric and chromomagnetic field insertion into the Wilson loop. These last contain information on the profile of the\nflux tube and turn out to be much more sensitive to the QCD vacuum models\nor the topological configurations9,24 c . Thus, it is much more interesting to\nstudy the full non relativistic dynamics of heavy quarks in place of the much\nmore qualitative statement about finding out confining configurations into the\nWilson loop. In particular, it would be interesting to have a lattice calculations of (10), (11), (12) and the other 1/m2 potentials contained in 22 , using\nmonopoles configurations2 versus center vortices4,5 . In conclusion, I would like\nto invite the people working in the field to calculate local gluon condensates,\nnonlocal gluon condensates, Wilson loops and field insertions into the Wilson\nloop in their topological models and to relate them to the phenomenological\ndata using the unified and systematic frame of the EFT that I presented here.\nAcknowledgments\nIt is my great pleasure to thank the Organizers of this School, P.
