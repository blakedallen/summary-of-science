Further improvements in the determination\nof the oscillation parameters are discussed and implications of the solar neutrino and\nKamLAND results are considered.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe first KamLAND results [1] are the last (or almost last) step in resolution of the longstanding solar neutrino problem [2]. \"In the context of two flavor neutrino oscillations\nwith the CPT invariance, the KamLAND results exclude all oscillation solutions of this\nproblem but the 'Large mixing angle' solution\" [1]. In fact, KamLAND excludes also all\nnon-oscillation solutions based on neutrino spin-flip in the magnetic fields of the Sun, on\nthe non-standard neutrino interactions, etc.. More precisely, KamLAND excludes them as\nthe dominant mechanisms of the solar neutrino conversion.\nSoon after the suggestion of the MSW mechanism [3], the \"MSW triangle\" [4] had been\nconstructed in the \u2206m2 \u2212 sin2 2\u03b8 plane which corresponds to 1/4 - 1/3 suppression of the\nArgon production rate [5]. The region around the upper right corner of this triangle, or\nlarge sin2 2\u03b8 part of its horizontal side (\"the adiabatic solution\") is what we call now the\nLMA region.\nKamiokande [6], SAGE [7] and GALLEX [8] have disintegrated the triangle into pieces\nexcluding some parts of oscillation parameter space. First, the results from Kamiokande\n(the absence of a strong spectrum distortion as well as the absence of strong Day-Night\neffect) have chipped off the LMA region. Then Gallium experiments SAGE and GALLEX,\nconfirming LMA, have splitted the diagonal side of the triangle into SMA and LOW. Apart\nfrom that vacuum oscillation solutions (VO) were always present.\nFor a long time SMA was the favored solution and LMA was considered as an non excluded possibility. Things changed in 1998 when Super-Kamiokande [9] has testified against\nSMA (the flatness of spectrum and the absence of a peak in the zenith angle distribution\nof events in the Earth core bin). Soon after that, the analysis of the Super-Kamiokande\ndata for 708 days of operation allowed us [10] to conclude that solar neutrino results provide\nhints that the LMA solution could be correct (see also analysis in [11]). Since that time\nLMA continuously reinforced its position.\nSuper-Kamiokande [9] and then SNO [12] have accomplished genesis of the triangle.\nThey have practically excluded SMA, disfavored LOW and VO, and shifted the LMA region to larger \u2206m2 (small Day-Night asymmetry at Super-Kamiokande) and smaller mixings\n(small ratio of CC/NC events at SNO).\nBy the time of the KamLAND announcement, the solar neutrino data [5, 7, 8, 9, 12,\n13, 14] have definitely selected LMA as the most favorable solution based on neutrino mass\nand mixing [15, 16]. The best fit point from the free boron neutrino flux fit [16] is\n\u2206m2 = 6.15 * 10\u22125eV2 ,\n\ntan2 \u03b8 = 0.41,\n\nfB = 1.05,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere fB \u2261 FB /FBSSM is the boron neutrino flux in the units of the Standard Solar Model\npredicted flux [17].\n1\n\n\fOn basis of the solar neutrino results (and the assumption of the CPT invariance)\npredictions for the KamLAND experiment have been calculated. A significant suppression\nof the signal was expected in the case of the LMA solution. The predicted ratio of the\nnumbers of events with the visible (prompt) energies, Ep , above 2.6 MeV with and without\noscillations equals [16]:\nLM A\nRKL\n= 0.65+0.09\n(3\u03c3).\n(2)\n\u22120.40\nFor other solutions of the solar neutrino problem one expected RKL = 0.9 \u2212 1, where the\ndeviation from 1 can be due to the effect of nonzero 1-3 mixing.\nIn the best fit point (1) the predicted spectrum has (i) a peak at Ep \u2248 (3.0 \u2212 3.6) MeV,\n(ii) a suppression of the number of events near the threshold energy Ep \u2248 2.6 MeV and (iii)\na significant suppression of the signal (with respect to the no-oscillation case) at the high\nenergies: Ep > (4 \u2212 5) MeV [16]. No distortion of the spectrum is expected for the other\nsolutions.\nThe first KamLAND results: both the total number of events and spectrum shape [1],\nare in a very good agreement with predictions:\nexp\nRKL\n= 0.611 \u00b1 0.094 .\n\n(3)\n\nThe spectral data (although not yet precise) reproduce well the features described above.\nAs a result, the allowed \"island\" in the \u2206m2 \u2212 sin2 2\u03b8 plane with the best fit KamLAND\npoint covers the best fit point from the solar neutrino analysis [1].\nIn this paper we present our analysis of the KamLAND data as well as combined analysis\nof the solar neutrinos and KamLAND results. The impact of KamLAND on the LMA MSW\nsolution is studied. We consider implications of the combined (solar neutrinos + KamLAND)\nanalysis and make predictions for the future measurements.\nDuring preparation of this paper, several studies of the first KamLAND results and solar\nneutrino data have been published [18] - [25]. Our conclusions are in a good agreement with\nresults of those papers, although there are some differences. Detailed comparison of results\nwill be done later.\n\n2\n\nKamLAND\n\nIn a given energy bin a (a = 1, ....13) the signal at KamLAND is determined by\nNa = A\n\nXZ\ni\n\nEa +\u2206E\n\nEa\n\ndEp\n\n2\n\nZ\n\ndEp\u2032 Pi Fi \u03c3f (Ep , Ep\u2032 ) ,\n\n(4)\n\n\fwhere \u2206E = 0.425 MeV,\n\u2206m212 Li\nPi = 1 \u2212 sin 2\u03b812 sin\n4E\n2\n\n2\n\n!\n\n(5)\n\nis the vacuum oscillation survival probability for i reactor situated at the distance Li from\nKamLAND, Fi is the flux from i reactor, \u03c3 is the cross-section of \u03bd\u0304p \u2192 e+ n reaction, Ep is\nthe observed prompt energy, Ep\u2032 is the true prompt energy, f (Ep , Ep\u2032 ) is the energy resolution\nfunction, A is the factor which takes into account the fiducial volume, the time of observation, etc.. We sum over all reactors contributing appreciable to the flux at KamLAND.\nThe suppression factor of the total number of (reactor neutrino) events above certain\nthreshold is defined as:\nRKL (\u2206m2 , tan2 \u03b8) \u2261\n\nN(\u2206m2 , tan2 \u03b8)\n,\nN0\n\n(6)\n\nwhere N = a Na , Na is given in (4) and N0 is the total number of events in the absence\nof oscillations (following KamLAND we will call N and N0 the rates).\nP\n\n1).

Notice that in contrast with the KamLAND result [1]\nour best fit mixing deviates from the maximal mixing.\nWe present in fig. 1 the contours of constant confidence level with respect to the best fit\npoint (8) in the (\u2206m2 \u2212 tan2 \u03b8) plane using relation: \u03c72 = \u03c72min + \u2206\u03c72 , where \u2206\u03c72 = 1, 3.84\nand 6.63 for 1\u03c3, 95% and 99% C.L. correspondingly.\nThe contours manifest an oscillatory pattern in \u2206m2 in spite of a strong averaging\neffect which originates from large spread in distances from different reactors. The pattern\ncan be described in terms of oscillations with certain effective distance, Lef f , and effective\noscillation phase \u03c6ef f :\n\u2206m212 Lef f\n\u03c6ef f =\n, Lef f \u2248 165 km.\n(9)\n4E\n3\n\n\fLef f corresponds to the distance between KamLAND and the closest set of reactors which\nprovides the large fraction of the antineutrino flux. Notice that Lef f is smaller than the\naverage (weighted with power) distance 189 km.\nLet us consider the 95% allowed regions.\n(i) The lowest \"island\" allowed by KamLAND with \u2206m2 < 2 * 10\u22125 eV2 corresponds to\nthe oscillation phase \u03c6ef f < \u03c0/2. This region is excluded by the absence of significant daynight asymmetry of the Super-Kamiokande signal. In this domain, the predicted asymmetry\nO\nat SNO, ASN\nDN > 17%, is still consistent with data.\n(ii) The second allowed region, \u2206m2 = (5 \u2212 10) * 10\u22125 eV2 , corresponds to the first\noscillation maximum, \u03c6ef f \u223c \u03c0 (maximum of the survival probability). It contains the best\nfit point.\n(iii) The third island is at \u2206m2 = (13 \u2212 23) * 10\u22125 eV2 : it corresponds to the oscillation\nmaximum (second maximum of the survival probability) with \u03c6ef f \u223c 2\u03c0.\nThere is a continuum of the allowed regions above \u2206m2 \u223c 3 * 10\u22124 eV2 . The third region\nmerges with the continuum at 99% CL.\nAt the 1\u03c3 level the second island is the only allowed region.\n2) KamLAND rate. In fig.1 we show the regions excluded by the KamLAND rate at 95%\nmax\n= 0.80 and\nC.L.. The borders of these regions coincide with contours of constant RKL\nmin\n2\nRKL = 0.42 obtained in [16]). The exclusion region at \u2206m \u223c (2 \u2212 5) * 10\u22125 eV2 corresponds to the first oscillation minimum (minimum of the survival probability) at KamLAND\n(\u03c6ef f \u223c \u03c0/2). Here the suppression of the signal is too strong. Another region of significant\nsuppression (second oscillation minimum with \u03c6ef f = 3\u03c0/2) is at \u2206m2 \u223c (9 \u2212 12) * 10\u22125 eV2 .\n3). KamLAND spectrum. Low threshold. We analyze the spectrum with the threshold\nEpth = 0.9 MeV, using the same prescription for the contribution of the geological neutrinos\nas in [1]. The best fit point shifts with respect to (8) to larger mixing and smaller mass\nsquared difference:\n\u2206m2 = 6.86 * 10\u22125eV2 , tan2 \u03b8 = 0.48 .\n(10)\nIn fig. 2 we show the allowed regions at 68 %, 95% and 99% confidence levels.\nWith lowering the threshold the sensitivity to the spectrum shape increases: the measurements become sensitive not only to the dominant oscillation peak but also to the lower\nenergy oscillation maximum. As a result, the analysis leads to stronger exclusion of the\noscillation parameter space. In particular, maximal and large mixing parts become less\nfavored than in the case of high threshold.\n\n4\n\n\f4). KamLAND spectrum and rate. Following procedure in [1] we have performed also\ncombined analysis of spectrum and rate introducing the free normalization parameter of the\nspectrum, RKL , and defining the \u03c72 as\n\u03c72spec,R = \u03c72spec + \u03c72R ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere\n\nRKL \u2212 0.611 2\n.\n(12)\n0.094\nWe find results which are very close to those from our spectrum analysis. In particular, the\nbest fit value of mixing is tan2 \u03b8 = 0.48 and \u2206m2 = 7.31 * 10\u22125 eV2 .\n\u03c72R =\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\nAs it follows from our consideration here, the values of oscillation parameters extracted\nfrom the KamLAND data, (\u2206m2 , tan2 \u03b8)KL , are in a very good agreement with the values\nfrom independent solar neutrino analysis (\u2206m2 , tan2 \u03b8)sun , For the best fit points (1), (8)\n(10) we conclude that within 1\u03c3 (see fig. 1 and fig. 2)\n(\u2206m2 , tan2 \u03b8)KL = (\u2206m2 , tan2 \u03b8)sun .\n\n(13)\n\nAt the same time, the data do not exclude that the solar and KamLAND parameters are different, and moreover, the difference still can be large. For instance, (\u2206m2 , tan2 \u03b8)KL can coincide with the present best fit point or be in the high \u2206m2 island, whereas (\u2206m2 , tan2 \u03b8)sun\ncan be at lower \u2206m2 .\n\n3\n\nSolar Neutrinos\n\nWe use the same data set and the same procedure of analysis as in our previous publication [16]. Here the main ingredients of the analysis are summarized.\nThe data sample consists of\n- 3 total rates: (i) the Ar-production rate, QAr , from Homestake [5], (ii) the Ge\u2212production\nrate, QGe from SAGE [7] and (iii) the combined Ge\u2212production rate from GALLEX and\nGNO [8];\n- 44 data points from the zenith-spectra measured by Super-Kamiokande during 1496 days\nof operation [9];\n- 38 day-night spectral points from SNO [13, 14].\nAltogether the solar neutrino experiments provide us with 81 data points.\nAll the solar neutrino fluxes, but the boron neutrino flux, are taken according to SSM\nBP2000 [17]. The boron neutrino flux is treated as a free parameter. For the hep\u2212neutrino\nflux we take fixed value Fhep = 9.3 \u00d7 103 cm\u22122 s\u22121 [17, 26] .\n5\n\n\fThus, in our analysis of the solar neutrino data as well as in the combined analysis of\nthe solar and KamLAND results we have three fit parameters: \u2206m2 , tan2 \u03b8 and fB .\nWe define the contribution of the solar neutrino data to \u03c72 as\n\u03c72sun = \u03c72rate + \u03c72SK + \u03c72SN O ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere \u03c72rate , \u03c72SK and \u03c72SN O are the contributions from the total rates, the Super-Kamiokande\nzenith spectra and the SNO day and night spectra correspondingly. The main result of\nanalysis performed in [16] is given here in Eq. (1).\n\n4\n\nSolar neutrinos and KamLAND\n\nWe have performed two different combined fits of the data from the solar neutrino experiments and KamLAND.\n1) KamLAND rate and solar neutrino data. There are 81 (solar) + 1 (KamLAND) data\npoints - 3 free parameters = 79 d.o.f.. We define the global \u03c72 for this case as\n\u03c72sun,R = \u03c72sun + \u03c72R ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03c72sun and \u03c72R are given in (14) and (12). The minimum \u03c72sun,R (min)/d.o.f. = 65.2/79\ncorresponds to the C.L. = 86.7% . It appears at\n\u2206m2 = 6.03 * 10\u22125 eV2 ,\n\ntan2 \u03b8 = 0.411,\n\nfB = 1.05.\n\n(16)\n\nThis point practically coincides with what we have obtained from the solar neutrino analysis\nonly.\nWe construct the contours of constant confidence level in the (\u2206m2 \u2212 tan2 \u03b8) plot using\nthe following procedure. We perform minimization of \u03c72sun,R with respect to fB for each point\nof the oscillation plane, thus getting \u03c72sun,R (\u2206m2 , tan2 \u03b8). Then the contours are defined by\nthe condition \u03c72sun,R(\u2206m2 , tan2 \u03b8) = \u03c72sun,R (min) + \u2206\u03c72 , where \u2206\u03c72 = 2.3, 4.61, 5.99, 9.21\nand 11.83 are taken for 1\u03c3, 90%, 95% and 99% C.L. and 3\u03c3. The results are shown in fig. 3.\nAccording to the figure, the main impact of the KamLAND rate is strengthening of\nbound on the allowed region from below due to strong suppression of the KamLAND rate\nat \u2206m2 = (2 \u2212 5) * 10\u22125 eV2 (see fig. 1) - region of the first oscillation minimum in KamLAND. The lines of constant confidence level are shifted to larger \u2206m2 . The KamLAND\nrate leads to a distortion (shift to smaller mixings) of contours at \u2206m2 \u223c 10\u22124 eV2 where\nthe second oscillation minimum at KamLAND is situated. The upper part of the allowed\nregion is modified rather weakly.\n\n6\n\n\f2). KamLAND spectrum and solar neutrino data. We calculate\n\u03c72global = \u03c72sun + \u03c72spec ,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere \u03c72spec has been defined in (7). In this case we have 81 (solar) + 13 (KamLAND) data\npoints - 3 free parameters = 91 d.o.f.. The absolute minimum, \u03c72global (min) = 68.2 (which\ncorresponds to a very high confidence level: 96.3%), is at\n\u2206m2 = 7.32 * 10\u22125 eV2 ,\n\ntan2 \u03b8 = 0.409,\n\nfB = 1.05.\n\n(18)\n\nThe best fit value of \u2206m2 is slightly higher than that from the solar data analysis. The solar\nneutrino data have higher sensitivity to mixing, whereas the KamLAND is more sensitive\nto \u2206m2 , as a result, in (18) the value of \u2206m2 is close to the one determined from the\nKamLAND data only (8), whereas tan2 \u03b8 coincides with mixing determined from the solar\nneutrino results (1).\nWe construct the contours of constant confidence levels in the oscillation plane, similarly\nto what we did for the fit of the solar data and the KamLAND rate (fig. 4).\nAs compared with the solar data analysis, KamLAND practically has not changed the\nupper bound on mixing, but strengthened the bound on \u2206m2 . At the 3\u03c3 level we get:\n\u2206m2 < 2.8 * 10\u22124 eV2 ,\n\ntan2 \u03b8 < 0.84,\n\n99.73% C.L. .\n\n(19)\n\nThe spectral data disintegrate the LMA region. At the 3\u03c3 level only a small spot is left\nin the range \u2206m2 > 2.5 * 10\u22124 eV2 .\nAt the 99% C.L. the rest of the region splits into two \"islands\" which we will refer to\nas the lower (l-) and higher (h-) LMA regions. (Existence of these two islands can be seen\nalready from an overlap of the solar and KamLAND allowed regions in [1]). The l-region is\ncharacterized by\n\u2206m2 = (4.7 \u2212 10) * 10\u22125eV2 ,\n\ntan2 \u03b8 = 0.27 \u2212 0.75.\n\n(20)\n\nIt contains the best fit point (18). The h-region is determined by\n\u2206m2 = (12 \u2212 20) * 10\u22125 eV2 ,\n\ntan2 \u03b8 = 0.29 \u2212 0.63,\n\n(21)\n\nwith best fit point at\n\u2206m2 = 14.5 * 10\u22125 eV2 ,\n\ntan2 \u03b8 = 0.41.\n\n(22)\n\nThis point is accepted with respect to the global minimum (18) at about 2\u03c3 level.\nThe excluded region between two islands corresponds to the second oscillation minimum\n(\u03c6ef f \u223c 3\u03c0/2) at Ep \u223c (3 \u2212 4)MeV which contradicts the spectral data.\n\n7\n\n\fFeatures of spectrum distortion. In the fig. 5 we show the prompt energy spectra of events\nfor the best fit points in the l- and h-regions, Nl (Ep ) and Nh (Ep ). The spectra can be well\nunderstood in terms of the effective oscillation phase \u03c6ef f :\nh\n\ni\n\nN(Ep ) \u223c N0 (Ep ) 1 + D(Ep ) sin2 \u03c6ef f ,\nwhere D(Ep ) is the averaging factor.\n\n(23)\n\nIn the best fit point of l-region (18), the peak at Ep \u2248 3.6 MeV corresponds to the\noscillation maximum \u03c6ef f = \u03c0 (exact position of maximum of the survival probability is at\nEp = 4.3MeV). The closest oscillation minimum (phase \u03c6ef f = 3\u03c0/2) is at Ep \u2248 2.4 MeV\nand the next maximum (\u03c6ef f = 2\u03c0) is at Ep \u2248 1.8 MeV. Due to strong averaging effect the\nstructures below (in Ep ) the main maximum are not profound and look more like a shoulder\nbelow the peak. The first oscillation minimum is at Ep = 7.2 MeV.\nIn the case of h-region (22) the spectrum has similar structure but (due to larger \u2206m2 )\nthe energy intervals between maxima and minima decrease. The main peak at Ep \u2248 3.4\nMeV corresponds now to the second oscillation maximum with \u03c6ef f = 2\u03c0. One can calculate\nthen that the next minimum ( \u03c6ef f = 5\u03c0/2) is at Ep \u2248 2.7 MeV and the next maximum\n(\u03c6ef f = 3\u03c0) is at E = 2.2 MeV. The higher energy oscillation minimum (\u03c6ef f = 3\u03c0/2) is at\nE = 5 MeV. This pattern can be seen in the fig. 5 which confirms validity of the effective\nphase consideration.\nThe measured spectrum, indeed, gives a hint of existence of the low energy shoulder.\nEvidently with the present data it is impossible to disentangle the l- and h- spectra. Substantial decrease of errors is needed. Also decrease of the energy threshold will help. According\nto fig. 5, Nl (Ep ) > Nh (Ep ) at Ep > 3.5 MeV, and Nl (Ep ) < Nh (Ep ) at lower energies, especially in the interval Ep = (2.0 \u2212 2.5) MeV. Therefore for the low threshold the difference\nbetween Nl (Ep ) and Nh (Ep ) can not be eliminated by normalization (mixing angle). See\nsimilar discussion in [19].\nPull-off diagrams. To check the quality of the fit we have constructed the pull-off diagrams [32] which show deviations, DK , of the predicted values of the observables Kbf from\nthe central experimental values, Kexp , in the units of the 1\u03c3 experimental errors, \u03c3K ,:\nDK \u2261\n\nKbf \u2212 Kexp\n,\n\u03c3K\n\n(24)\n\nO\nSK\nwhere K = QAr , QGe , CC/NC, ASN\nDN , ADN , RKL , fB .\n\nIn fig. 6 we show the pull-off diagrams for the best fit points from the l- and h-regions. In\nboth regions the largest deviation is for the Ar-production rate. In the h-region: QAr > 3.1\nSNU, which is 2.5\u03c3 above the Homestake result. In the l-region the QAr deviation is smaller:\nabout 1.8\u03c3.\nOther deviations are about 1\u03c3 or smaller; they are even smaller in the l-region. In the\nh-region a very small D-N asymmetry is expected. The l- and h-regions lead to the opposite\n8\n\n\fsign deviations for the CC/NC ratio at SNO, and therefore future precise measurements of\nthis ratio will discriminate among l- and h- solutions. Notice also that in h-region fB < 1.\n\n5\n\nEffect of 1-3 mixing\n\nWe assume that \u2206m213 = \u2206m2atm = (2 \u2212 3) * 10\u22123 eV2 , and there is a non-zero admixture\nof \u03bde in the third mass eigenstate described by the angle \u03b813 . Both for KamLAND and for\nsolar neutrinos the oscillations driven by \u2206m213 are averaged out and signals are determined\nby the survival probabilities\nPee = (1 \u2212 sin2 \u03b813 )2 P2 + sin4 \u03b813 \u2248 (1 \u2212 2 sin2 \u03b813 )P2 .\n\n(25)\n\nHere P2 = P2 (\u2206m212 , \u03b812 ) is the two neutrino vacuum oscillation probability for KamLAND\nand it is the two neutrino conversion probability for solar neutrinos. The factor (1\u2212sin2 \u03b813 )2\nleads to additional suppression of the KamLAND signal and shift of the allowed regions to\nsmaller \u03b812 (see detailed study in [27]). The effect of \u03b813 on the solar neutrino analysis has\nbeen discussed in [16].\nWe have performed the combined analysis of the solar neutrino and KamLAND data\nfor a fixed value of sin2 \u03b813 taken at the upper bound given by the CHOOZ experiment [28]:\nsin2 \u03b813 = 0.04. The number of degrees of freedom is the same as in the 2\u03bd fit and we follow\nprocedure described in sect. 4 with survival probabilities modified according to (25).\nIn fig. 7 we show results of the combined analysis of the solar data and the KamLAND\nrate. As can be concluded from comparison of fig. 3 and fig. 7, the main impact of nonzero 1-3 mixing is a slight shift of the allowed region to larger \u2206m2 and smaller tan2 \u03b8. In\nparticular, we find that the best fit, \u03c72min /d.o.f. = 66.21/79, is at\n\u2206m2 = 6.60 * 10\u22125 eV2 ,\n\ntan2 \u03b8 = 0.411 fB = 1.08.\n\n(26)\n\nIn fig. 8 we show result of the combined analysis of the solar neutrino data and the\nKamLAND spectrum. From fig. 8 and fig. 4 we observe the same effect: 1-3 mixing leads\nto a shift of the allowed region to larger \u2206m2 and smaller tan2 \u03b8. In the best fit point we\nfind \u03c72min /d.o.f. = 69.24/91 and\n\u2206m2 = 7.17 * 10\u22125 eV2 ,\n\ntan2 \u03b8 = 0.41, fB = 1.07.\n\n(27)\n\nThe introduction of the 1-3 mixing slightly worsen the fit: \u2206\u03c72 \u2248 1, it requires higher\noriginal boron neutrino flux, than in the 2\u03bd- case. At the same time, the 1-3 mixing improves\na fit in the h-region: It is accepted now at 90 % C.L. with respect to the best fit point (27).\nThis region merges with the small spot at high \u2206m2 . The best fit point in the h-region is\nshifted to smaller mixing: tan2 \u03b8 = 0.36.\nFor convenience, the results of different fits are summarized in the Table 1. It shows\nhigh stability of the extracted parameters with respect to a type of analysis.\n9\n\n\fType of data fit\nsolar 2\u03bd\nKL spectrum, 2\u03bd\nsolar + KL rate, 2\u03bd\nsolar + KL spectrum, 2\u03bd\nsolar + KL rate, 3\u03bd\nsolar + KL spectrum, 3\u03bd\n\n\u2206m2\n6.15\n7.34\n6.03\n7.32\n6.60\n7.17\n\ntan2 \u03b8\n0.406\n0.453\n0.411\n0.409\n0.411\n0.409\n\nfB \u03c72min /d.o.f.\n1.05\n65.2/78\n2.92/11\n1.05\n65.3/79\n1.05\n68.2/91\n1.08\n66.2/79\n1.07\n69.2/91\n\nTable 1: The parameters of the best fit points as well as \u03c72min /d.o.f. from different analyses\nof the data; \u2206m2 is in the units 10\u22125 eV2 .\n\n6\n\nNext step\n\nThe key problems left after the first KamLAND results are\n\u2022 more precise determination of the neutrino parameters: in particular, (i) precise determination of the deviation of 12-mixing from maximal mixing, (ii) strengthening of\nthe upper bound on \u2206m2 (iii) discrimination between the two existing regions;\n\u2022 searches for effects beyond the single \u2206m2 and single mixing approximation;\n\u2022 searches for differences of the neutrino oscillation parameters determined from KamLAND and from the solar neutrino experiments.\nNotice that precise knowledge of the parameters is crucial not only for the neutrinoless\ndouble beta decay searches, long baseline experiments, studies of the atmospheric and supernova neutrinos, etc., but also for understanding of physics of the solar neutrino conversion.\nIn the region of the best fit point a dominating process (at least for E > (0.5 \u2212 1) MeV)\nis the adiabatic neutrino conversion (MSW), whereas in the high \u2206m2 region allowed by\nKamLAND at the 2\u03c3 level, the effect is reduced to the averaged vacuum oscillations (a la\nGribov-Pontecorvo) [29] with small matter corrections.\nIn this connection, we will discuss two questions.\nHow small \u2206m2 can be? This is especially important question, e.g., for measurements of\nthe earth regeneration effect. In the l-region we get\n\u2206m2 > 4 * 10\u22125 eV2 ,\n\n(3\u03c3)\n\nand it is difficult to expect that lower values will be allowed.\n10\n\n(28)\n\n\fThe bound (28) appears as an interplay of both the KamLAND rate and the shape.\nAs it follows from the fig. 3, the KamLAND rate strengthens the lower bounds: \u2206m2 \u2265\n(3.0, 4.0, 4.7) \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2 , at the 1\u03c3, 2\u03c3, 3\u03c3 correspondingly which should be compared\nwith \u2206m2 \u2265 (2.5, 3.2, 4.0) \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2 from the solar analysis only. Adding the spectral\ndata results in the bounds \u2206m2 \u2265 3.3, 5.5, 6.2 \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2\nWith decrease of \u2206m2 the oscillatory pattern of the spectrum shifts to lower energies.\nFor \u2206m2 = 5 * 10\u22125 eV2 the maximum of spectrum is at Ep = 2.7 MeV and the oscillation\nsuppression increases with energy [16]. The oscillation minimum is at Ep \u2248 5 MeV. If\nRKL (2.7 MeV) = 0.81, then RKL (4.0 MeV) = 0.47. The KamLAND spectrum does not\nshow such a fast decrease.\nOne can characterize the spectrum distortion by a relative suppression of signal at the\nhigh (say, above 4.3 MeV) and at the low (below 4.3 MeV) energies 1 . The energy interval\n(2.6 - 4.3) MeV contains KamLAND energy 4 bins. Introducing the suppression factors\nRKL (< 4.3 MeV) and RKL (> 4.3 MeV) we can define the ratio\nk=\n\n1 \u2212 RKL (> 4.3 MeV)\n.\n1 \u2212 RKL (< 4.3 MeV)\n\n(29)\n\nk which we will call the shape parameter does not depend on the mixing angle and normalization of spectrum. It increases with increase of the oscillation suppression at high\nenergies.\nUsing the KamLAND data we get the experimental value\nk exp = 0.84+.42\n\u22120.35 ,\n\n1\u03c3.\n\n(30)\n\nIn fig. 9 we present the dependence of the shape parameter k on \u2206m2 for fixed mixing:\ntan2 \u03b8 = 0.41. For the spectrum which corresponds to the best combined fit we find k = 0.70,\nwhereas for \u2206m2 = 5 * 10\u22125 eV2 the ratio equals k = 2.0. For the h-region best point:\nk = 0.94.\nNotice that in the l-region below \u2206m2 = 8 * 10\u22125 eV2 , k increases quickly with decrease\nof \u2206m2 , reaching a maximal value at \u2206m2 = 5.5 * 10\u22125 eV2 . Below that, the parameter k\ndecreases with \u2206m2 . In this region, however, the total event rate decreases fast giving the\nbound on \u2206m2 . This explains a shift of the allowed (at 3\u03c3) region to smaller mixings with\ndecrease of \u2206m2 .\nNotice also that the central experimental value of k can be reproduced in the both allowed regions (l- and h-). Therefore future precise measurement of spectrum will further\nsharpen determination of \u2206m2 within a given island. To discriminate among the islands\none needs to use more elaborated criteria (not just k) or a complete spectral information.\n1\n\nAn alternative way is to introduce the moments of the energy spectrum [30].\n\n11\n\n\fHow large is the large mixing? In contrast to [1] our best fit point is at non-maximal mixing\n(sin2 2\u03b8 = 0.86) being rather close to the best fit point from the solar neutrino analysis.\nSimilar deviation from maximal mixing has been obtained in our rate+spectrum analysis.\nNotice that the KamLAND data have weak sensitivity to the mixing (weaker than the solar\nneutrino data). The allowed regions cover the interval\ntan2 \u03b8 = 0.12 \u2212 1.00\n\n(\u03b8 < \u03c0/2),\n\n95%C.L..\n\n(31)\n\nEven at 1\u03c3 the interval tan2 \u03b8 = 0.23 \u2212 1.00 (\u03b8 < \u03c0/2) is allowed. The reason is that\nKamLAND is essentially the vacuum oscillation experiment (see evaluation of matter effects\nin KamLAND in [23]), and effects of the vacuum oscillations depend on deviation from\nmaximal mixing which can be characterized by \u01eb = (1/2 \u2212sin2 \u03b8) quadratically: P \u221d 1 \u22124\u01eb2 .\nThe matter conversion depends on \u01eb linearly: P \u221d 1 \u2212 2\u01eb [31].\nNotice that maximal mixing is rather strongly disfavored by all measured solar neutrino\nrates. In the point indicated by KamLAND we predict the charged current to neutral\ncurrent measurement at SNO, the Argon production rate and the Germanium production\nrate:\nCC\n= 0.51 (+3.3\u03c3),\nNC\n\nQAr = 3.2 SNU (+2.5\u03c3),\n\nQGe = 63 SNU (\u22121.6\u03c3).\n\n(32)\n\nIn brackets we show the pulls of the predictions from the best fit experimental values.\nAs follows from the fig. 10 future precise measurements of the CC/NC ratio at SNO will\nstrengthen the upper bounds on both mixing and \u2206m2 .\nIt is important to \"overdetermine\" the neutrino parameters measuring all possible observables. This will allow us to make cross-checks of selected solution and to search for\ninconsistencies which will require extensions of the theoretical context. In this connection\nlet us consider predictions for the forthcoming measurements.\n1). Precise measurements of the CC/NC ratio at SNO. In fig. 10 we show the contours of\nconstant CC/NC ratio. We find predictions for the best fit point and the 3\u03c3 interval:\nCC\n= 0.33+0.15\n\u22120.07 ,\nNC\n\n3\u03c3.\n\n(33)\n\nAt 99% C.L. the islands split and we get the following predictions for them separately:\nCC\n(l \u2212 region) = 0.33+0.11\n\u22120.06 ,\nNC\n\nCC\n(h \u2212 region) = 0.38+0.06\n\u22120.03 ,\nNC\n\n99% C.L. .\n\n(34)\n\nValues of CC/NC < 0.35 will exclude the h-region. Precise measurements of the ratio\nCC/NC will also strengthen the upper bounds on mixing and \u2206m2 .\n\n12\n\n\f2). The day-night asymmetry at SNO. The KamLAND provides a strong lover bound on\n\u2206m2 , and shifts the best fit point to larger \u2206m2 . This further diminishes the expected\nO\nvalue of day-night asymmetry. In fig. 10 we show the contours of constant ASN\nDN . The best\nfit point prediction and the 3\u03c3 bound equal\nO\nASN\nN D = 2.8 \u00b1 0.8% ,\n\n(1\u03c3),\n\nO\nASN\nN D < 9%\n\n(3\u03c3).\n\n(35)\n\nThe present best fit value of the SNO asymmetry, 7%, is accepted at about 99% C.L.. ObserO\nvations of the asymmetry ASN\nN D > 1% will exclude the h-region. The expected asymmetry\nat Super-Kamiokande is even smaller: In the best fit point we expect ASK\nN D \u2248 (1.7 \u2212 2.0)%.\n3). The turn up of the spectrum at SNO and Super-Kamiokande at low energies. Using\nresults of [32] we predict for the best fit point (18) an increase of ratio of the observed to\nCC\nexpected (without oscillation) number of the CC events, RSN\nO , from 0.31 at 8 MeV to 0.345\nat 5 MeV, so that\nCC\nCC\nRSN\nO (5MeV) \u2212 RSN O (8MeV)\n= 0.10 \u2212 0.12.\n(36)\nCC\nRSN\nO (8MeV)\nIn Super-Kamiokande the turn up is about (5 \u2212 7)% in the same interval (5 - 8) MeV.\n4). Further KamLAND measurements. Possible impact can be estimated using figures 1,\n2, 5. A decrease of the error by factor of 2 (which will require both significant increase of\nstatistics and decrease of the systematic error) will allow KamLAND alone to exclude all the\nregions but the l-region at 95 % C.L., if the best fit is at the same point as it is determined\nnow.\n5). BOREXINO. At 3\u03c3 we predict the following suppressions of signals with respect to the\nSSM predictions to BOREXINO experiment [33], in the two allowed regions:\nRB (l \u2212 region) = 0.61 \u2212 0.73,\n\nRB (h \u2212 region) = 0.62 \u2212 0.73.\n\n(37)\n\nSo, BOREXINO will perform consistency check but it will not distinguish the l- and hregions.\n6). Gallium production rate. In the best fit point one predicts the germanium production\nrate QGe = 71 SNU. In the h-region best fit point QGe = 72 SNU. So, the Gallium experiments do not discriminate among the l - and h - regions. However, precise measurements of\nQGe are important for improvements of the bound on the 1-2 mixing and its deviation from\nmaximal value.\n\n13\n\n\f7\n\nConclusions\n\n1. The first KamLAND results (rate and spectrum) are in a very good agreement with the\npredictions based on the LMA MSW solution of the solar neutrino problem.\n2. Our analysis of the KamLAND data reproduces well the results of the collaboration.\nThe oscillation parameters extracted from the KamLAND data and from the solar neutrino\ndata agree within 1\u03c3.\n3. We have performed a combined analysis of the solar and KamLAND results. The main\nimpact of the KamLAND results on the LMA solution can be summarized in the following\nway. KamLAND\n\u2022 shifts the \u2206m2 to slightly higher values 6.15 * 10\u22125 \u2192 7.3 * 10\u22125 eV2 ; (the mixing is\npractically unchanged: tan2 \u03b8 = 0.41, and this number is rather stable with respect to\nvariations of the analysis;\n\u2022 establishes rather solid lower bound on the \u2206m2 : \u2206m2 > 4 * 10\u22125 eV2 (3\u03c3);\n\u2022 disintegrates the LMA region at 99% C.L. into two parts.\nKamLAND further disfavors high values of \u2206m2 : \u2206m2 > 3 * 10\u22124 eV2 .\n4. Inclusion of the 1-3 mixing shifts the allowed regions to larger \u2206m2 and smaller tan2 \u03b8.\n\u03c72 slightly increases with sin2 \u03b813 .\n5. The KamLAND results strengthen the upper bound on the expected value of the dayO\nnight asymmetry at SNO: ASN\n< 9%. We predict about 10% turn up of the energy\nDN\nspectrum at SNO in the interval of energies (5 - 8) MeV. The CC/NC ratio is expected to\nbe CC/NC \u2248 0.33, that is, near the present best SNO value.\nO\nwill have further strong\nFuture SNO measurements of the CC/NC ratio and ASN\nDN\nimpact on the LMA parameter space.\n\n8\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors are grateful to E.
