When the Coulomb interaction is\nlarge, spin-fluctuation mediated d-wave state appears due to the nesting between electron-pockets.\nInterestingly, the symmetry of the body-centered tetragonal structure in Kx Fe2 Se2 requires the\nexistence of nodes in the d-wave gap, although fully-gapped d-wave state is realized in the case of\nsimple tetragonal structure.

Therefore, both superconducting states are distinguishable by careful\nmeasurements of the gap structure or the impurity effect on Tc .\nPACS numbers: 74.20.-z, 74.20.Fg, 74.20.Rp\n\nThe pairing mechanism of high-Tc iron-based superconductors has been significant open problem. The\nmain characters of FeAs compounds would be (i) the\nnesting between electron-pockets (e-pockets) and holepockets (h-pockets), and (ii) the existence of orbital degree of freedom. By focusing on the intra-orbital nesting, fully-gapped sign-reversing s-wave state (s\u00b1 -wave\nstate) had been predicted based on the spin fluctuation\ntheories1,2 . On the other hand, existence of moderate\nelectron-phonon (e-ph) interactions due to Fe-ion optical phonons and the inter-orbital nesting can produce\nlarge orbital fluctuations3 . Then, orbital-fluctuationmediated s-wave state without sign reversal (s++ -wave\nstate) had been predicted by using the random-phaseapproximation (RPA)3,4 or the fluctuation-exchange\n(FLEX) approximation5 . According to the analysis in\nRefs. 6,7 the s++ -wave state is consistent with the\nrobustness of Tc against randomness8,9 as well as the\n\"resonance-like\" hump structure in the neutron inelastic scattering10 . Non-Fermi liquid transport phenomena\nin \u03c111 can be explained by the development of orbital\nfluctuations5 .\nRecently, iron-selenium 122-structure compound\nAx Fe2 Se2 (A= alkaline metals) with Tc \u223c 30 K was\ndiscovered12. This heavily electron-doped superconductor has been attracting great attention since both the\nband calculations13,14 and angle-resolved-photoemissionspectrum (ARPES) measurements15\u201317 indicate the\nabsence of h-pockets. NMR measurements reports the\nweakness of spin fluctuations18 , and both ARPES15\u201317\nand specific heat measurements19 indicate the isotropic\nSC gap. Thus, study of Ax Fe2 Se2 will give us important\ninformation to reveal the pairing mechanism of iron\npnictides.\nThe unit-cell of iron-based superconductors contains\ntwo Fe atoms. However, except for 122-systems, one\ncan construct a simple \"single-Fe model\" from the original \"two-Fe model\" by applying the gauge transformation on d-orbitals20 . By this procedure, the original\n\nBrillouin zone (BZ) is enlarged to the \"unfolded BZ\".\nBased on the single-Fe model, spin-fluctuation-mediated\nd-wave state (B1g representation) \"without nodes\" had\nbeen proposed21\u201323 , by focusing on the nesting between\ne-pockets. However, we cannot construct a \"single-Fe\nmodel\" for 122 systems since finite hybridization between\ne-pockets prevents the unfolding procedure20 . Therefore,\ntheoretical study based on the original two-Fe model is\nhighly desired to conclude the gap structure.\nIn this paper, we study the ten-orbital (two Fe atoms)\nHubbard-Holstein (HH) model for KFe2 Se2 using the\nRPA. When the Coulomb interaction is large, we obtain the d-wave SC state due to the spin fluctuations, as\npredicted by the recent theoretical studies in the singleFe Hubbard models21\u201323 . However, the gap function on\nthe Fermi surfaces (FSs) inevitably has \"nodal structure\"\nin the two-Fe model, due to the symmetry requirement\nof the body-centered tetragonal lattice. On the other\nhand, orbital-fluctuation-mediated s++ -wave state is realized by small e-ph coupling; the dimensionless coupling\nconstant \u03bb = gN (0) is just \u223c 0.2. Since the nodal SC\nstate is fragile against randomness, study of impurity effect will be useful to distinguish these SC states.\nWe perform the local-density-approximation (LDA)\nband calculation for KFe2 Se2 using Wien2k code based\non the experimental crystal structure12 . Next, we derive the ten-orbital tight-binding model that reproduces\nthe LDA band structure and its orbital character using\nWannier90 code and Wien2Wannier interface24 . The dispersion of the model and the primitive BZ are shown\nin Figs. 1 (a) and (b). Based on a similar ten-orbital\nmodel, Suzuki et al. studied the s\u00b1 -wave gap structure\nfor BaFe2 As2 25 .\nIn Fig. 1, we show the FSs of KFe2 Se2 for (c) kz = 0\nand (d) kz = \u03c0 planes when the electron number per Feion is n = 6.5: On each plane, there are four large and\nheavy e-pockets around X and Y points, and one small\nand light e-pockets around Z point. For n = 6.5, the\nenergy of the h-band at \u0393 point from the Fermi level,\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: (color online) (a) Dispersion of the present ten-orbital\nmodel for KFe2 Se2 . \u0393, X, and Z points are on the kz = 0\nplane. (b) Primitive BZ for body-centered tetragonal lattice.\n(c)(d) FSs on the kz = 0 plane and kz = \u03c0 plane. The green\n(light gray), red (gray), and blue (dark gray) lines correspond\nto xz, yz, and xy orbitals, respectively. The diamond-shaped\nshadows in (d) indicates the sign of basis function for B1g\nrepresentation. (e) Weight of each orbital on the inter FS\n(FS1) and the outer FS (FS2) as function of \u03b8; \u03b8 is shown in\n(d). (f) Hybridization between two e-pockets in 122 systems\nshould create the nodal d-wave gap.\n\nEh , is about \u22120.07 eV. Since the obtained FS topology\nand the value of Eh are consistent with recent reports by\nARPES measurements15\u201317 , we study the case n = 6.5\nhereafter. In the present BZ in (b), \u0393 and Z points and\nX and Y points in (c) are not equivalent, and kz = 2\u03c0\nplane is given by shifting (c) by (\u03c0, \u03c0). As for (d), T and\nT' points and P and P' points are equivalent, meaning\nthat the reciprocal wave vector on the kz = \u03c0 plane is\n(\u03c0, \u03c0) and (\u03c0, \u2212\u03c0). The diamond-shaped shadows in the\nkz = \u03c0 plane indicates the sign of basis function for B1g\n\n(x2 \u2212 y 2 -type) representation, which has nodes on the\nP-P' line on both FS1 (inner FS) and FS2 (outer FS).\nTo confirm the existence of nodes, we verify that FS1\nand FS2 in KFe2 Se2 are largely hybridized. In fact, the\nweights of d-orbitals on FS1,2 given in Fig. 1 (e) are\nsmooth functions of \u03b8, which is the strong evidence for\nthe hybridization in wide momentum space. This hybridization disappears when inter-layer hoppings are neglected: Then, both xy(FS1) and xy(FS2) show cusps\nat \u03b8 = \u03c0/4, and xz(FS2) suddenly drops to almost zero\nfor \u03b8 \u2265 \u03c0/4. In (f), we explain the origin of nodal gap\nbased on the fully-gapped d-wave solution in the singleFe model21\u201323 : By introducing inter-layer hoppings, two\nelliptical e-pockets with positive and negative \u2206 in the\nunfolded BZ are hybridized to form FS1 and 2 with fourfold symmetry. As a result, nodal lines inevitably emerge\non FS1 and 2, at least near the |kz | = \u03c0 plane.\nHere, we study the ten-orbital HH model using the\nRPA. As for the Coulomb interaction, we consider the\nintra-orbital term U , the inter-orbital term U \u2032 , Hund's\ncoupling or pair hopping J, and assume the relation U =\nU \u2032 + 2J and J = U/6. In addition, we consider the e-ph\ninteraction due to Fe-ion optical phonons; the phononmediated e-e interaction (\u2212g) and its matrix elements\nare presented in Ref. 4. Hereafter, we perform the RPA\non the two-dimensional planes for kz = 0, \u03c0/2, and \u03c0.\nFor n = 6.5 and kz = 0, the critical value of g for the\norbital-density-wave (ODW) is gc = 0.23 eV for U = 0,\nand the critical value of U for the spin-density-wave\n(SDW) is U = 1.18 eV for g = 0. These values change\nonly \u223c 2% for different kz . The obtained U -g phase diagram is very similar to Fig. 2 in Ref. 4, irrespective of\nthe absence of h-pockets in KFe2 Se2 . The reason would\nbe (i) the density-of-states (DOS) in KFe2 Se2 is about\n1eV\u22121 per Fe, which is comparable with other iron pnictides, and (ii) the nesting between e-pockets is rather\nstrong because of their square-like shape. Figure 2 (a)\nshows the total spin susuceptibility \u03c7s (q, 0) at U = 1.1\neV and g = 0 for kz = 0 plane. \u03c7s is given by the intraorbital nesting, and its peak position is q \u2248 (\u03c0, 0.4\u03c0),\nconsistenlty with previous studies21\u201323 . The obtained incommensulate spin correlation is the origin of the d-wave\nSC gap. Figure 2 (b) shows the off-diagonal orbital susceptibility \u03c7cyz,xy;yz,xy (q, 0) for the kz = 0 plane at U = 0\nand g = 0.22 eV; its definition is given in Refs. 3\u20135. It is\nderived from the inter-orbital nesting between xz and xy,\nand its peak position is q \u2248 (0.7\u03c0, 0.4\u03c0). Note that the\npeak position of \u03c7cxz,xy;xz,xy is q \u2248 (0.4\u03c0, 0.7\u03c0). The obtained strong spin- and orbital-correlations are the origin\nof the d-wave and s++ -wave SC states.\nIn the following, we solve the linearized gap equation\nto obtain the gap function, by applying the Lanczos algorithm to achieve reliable results. In the actual calculation results shown below, we take 64 \u00d7 64 k-point\nmeshes and 512 Matsubara frequencies. First, we study\nthe spin-fluctuation-mediated SC state for U . Uc by\nputting g = 0. Figures 3 (a)-(c) show the gap functions\nof the d-wave solution at T = 0.03 eV for kz = 0, \u03c0/2,\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 2: (color online) (a) \u03c7s (q, 0) for U = 1.1 eV and g = 0,\nand (b) \u03c7cyz,xy;yz,xy (q, 0) for U = 0 and g = 0.22 eV.\n\nand \u03c0, respectively. In case of U = 1.1 eV, the eigenvalue \u03bbE is 0.61 for (a), 0.63 for (b), and 0.62 for (c);\nthe relation \u03bbE \u2265 1 corresponds to the SC state. They\nare relatively small since the SC condensation energy becomes small when the SC gap has complicated nodal line\nstructure. On the (c) kz = \u03c0 plane, the nodal lines are\nalong \u03b8 = \u03c0/4 and 3\u03c0/4 directions, consistently with the\nbasis of B1g representation in Fig. 1 (d). These nodes\nmove to near the BZ boundary, \u03b8 = 0 and \u03c0, on the (b)\nkz = \u03c0/2 plane, and they deviate from the FSs on the\n(a) kz = 0 plane. As results, the nodal gap appears for\n\u03c0/2 < |kz | < 3\u03c0/2 in the whole BZ |kz | \u2264 2\u03c0.\nWe also obtain the s\u00b1 -wave state, with the sign reversal of the SC gap between e-pockets and the \"hidden\nh-pockets below the Fermi level\" given by the valence\nbands 5,6. The obtained solution is shown in Fig. 3\n(d) for kz = \u03c0. Interestingly, the obtained eigenvalue is\n\u03bbE = 0.99 for U = 1.1 eV, which is larger than \u03bbE for\nd-wave state in Fig. 3 (a)-(c). Such large \u03bbE originates\nfrom the scattering of Cooper pairs between e-pockets\nand the \"hidden h-pockets\", which was discussed as the\n\"valence-band Suhl-Kondo (VBSK) effect\" in the study\nof Nax CoO2 in Ref. 26.\nHere, we analyze the T -dependence of \u03bbE based on a\nsimple two-band model with inter-band repulsion: The\nset of gap equations is given by26 \u03bbE \u2206h = \u2212V Ne Le \u2206e\nand \u03bbE \u2206e = \u2212V Nh Lh \u2206h , where V > 0 is the repulsive interaction between e- and h-pockets, and Ne,h is\nthe DOS near the Fermi level. When (i) the top of\nthe h-pocket is well above the Fermi level, Le = Lh =\nln(1.13\u03c9c /T ), where \u03c9c is the cutoff\nenergy. Thus, the\n\u221a\neigenvalue is given as \u03bbE = V Ne Nh ln(1.13\u03c9c/T ) \u221d\n\u2212 ln T , similar to single-band BCS superconductors. On\nthe other hand, when (ii) h-pocket is slightly below the\nFermi level, Lh = (1/2) ln(\u03c9c /|Eh |), where Eh < 0 is the\n26\nenergy of the top \u221aof h-bandp\n. Thus, the eigenvalue\nis\n\u221a\ngiven as \u03bbE = V Ne Nh Lh ln(1.13\u03c9c /T ) \u221d \u2212 ln T .\nTherefore, in case (ii), the T -dependence of \u03bbE is much\nmoderate. In fact, as shown in Fig. 4 (a), \u03bbE for d-wave\nstate increases monotonically with decreasing T , while\n\u03bbE for s\u00b1 -wave state saturates at low temperatures. This\nresult suggests that the d-wave state overcomes the s\u00b1 wave state at Tc \u223c 30K in Kx Fe2 Se2 . Although Tc in the\ns\u00b1 -wave state is \u223c 0.06 eV in Fig. 4 (a), it is greatly reduced by the self-energy correction that is absent in the\nRPA5 .\n\nFIG. 3: (color online) SC gap functions for outer FS (FS2) on\nband 7 and inner FS (FS1) on band 8: d-wave gap functions\non the (a) kz = 0, (b) kz = \u03c0/2, and (c) kz = \u03c0 planes. Black\nand green (gray) lines represent the FSs and gap nodes. (d)\ns\u00b1 -wave gap function on the kz = \u03c0 plane.\n\nWe discuss the VBSK effect for s\u00b1 wave state in more\ndetail: According to inelastic neutron scattering measurement of Ba(Fe,Co)2 As2 10 , the characteristic spinfluctuation energy is \u03c9sf \u223c 100K just above Tc \u223c 30K. If\nwe assume a similar \u03c9sf in KFe2 Se2 since Tc is close,\nwe obtain the relation \u03c9c \u223c \u03c9sf \u226a |Eh | in KFe2 Se2 .\nSince Lh is a monotonic decrease function of |Eh |/\u03c9c\nand Lh < 1 for \u2212Eh /\u03c9c > 0.15, we consider that dwave state overcomes the s\u00b1 -wave state in KFe2 Se2 , as\nfar as the spin-fluctution mediated superconductivity is\nconsidered. Although high-Tc s\u00b1 -wave state mighe be\nrealized for |Eh |/\u03c9c < 0.1, then the realized Tc will be\nvery sensitive to Eh or the filling n26 .\nNow, we study the s++ -wave state due to orbital fluctuations on the kz = 0 plane with n = 6.5. In Fig. 4\n(b), we show the \u03b1c -dependence of \u03bbE at T = 0.03 for\nthe s++ -wave state with U = 0, and the \u03b1s -dependence\nof \u03bbE for the d-wave state with g = 0. Here, \u03b1c (\u03b1s )\n\n\f4\nphonon energy; \u03c9D = 0.15 eV, considering that the calculating temperature is about ten times larger than the real\nTc . The SC gap functions for s++ -wave state are rather\nisotropic, as shown in Fig. 4 (c). However, the obtained\nSC gap becomes more anisotropic in case of U > 05 .\nWe stress that the RPA is insufficient for quantitative\nstudy of \u03bbE since the self-energy correction \u03a3 is dropped:\nIn Ref. 5, we have studied the present model based on\nther FLEX approximation, and found that the critical\nregion with \u03b1c & 0.95 is enlarged by the inelastic staccering \u03b3 = Im\u03a3. Also, the \u03b3-induced suppression in \u03bbE\nfor d- or s\u00b1 -wave states is more prominent than that for\ns++ -wave state, since \u03b3 due to spin fluctuations is larger\nthan that due to orbtial fluctuaiotns5 .\nRecently, we found the paper by Mazin27 , in which\nthe kz dependence of the nodal d-wave gap in Fig. 4\ncorresponds to Figs. 3 (a)-(c) in the present work.\nIn summary, we studied the mechanism of superconductivity in KFe2 Se2 based on the ten-orbital HH model\nwithout h-pockets. Similar to iron-pnitide superconductors, orbital-fluctuation-mediated s++ -wave state is\nrealized by small dimensionless e-ph coupling constant\n\u03bb = gN (0) \u223c 0.2. We also studied the spin-fluctuationmediated d-wave state, and confirmed that nodal lines\nappear on the large e-pockets, due to the hybridization between two e-pockets that is inherent in 122 systems. Therefore, careful measurements on the SC gap\nanisotropy is useful to distinguish these different pairing mechanisms. Study of impurity effect on Tc is also\nuseful since d-wave (and s\u00b1 -wave) state is fragile against\nimpurities.\n\nAcknowledgments\nFIG. 4: (color online) (a) T -dependence of \u03bbE for d- and s\u00b1 wave states. \u03bbE at T = 0.01 eV is underestimated because\nof the shortage of k- and Matsubara-meshes.
