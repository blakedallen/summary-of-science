Nevertheless, thermodynamic considerations are a necessary step for understanding of the\nprocess. Of particular interest is the thermodynamic\ndriving force (TDF) which is responsible for one or another mechanism of growth. While this question is well\nunderstood in terms of wetting of the substrate by the\novergrowth in the cases of island or Volmer-Weber (VW)\ngrowth and layer-by-layer or Frank-van der Merwe (FM)\ngrowth,1,2,3 the Stranski-Krastanov (SK) growth (3D islands on top of a thin wetting layer) is far from being\nclarified. The reason is that the SK growth is in fact a\ngrowth of material A on the same material A, which thermodynamically requires the formation and growth of 2D\nrather than 3D islands. This is particularly true in the\ncase of the coherent Stranski-Krastanov growth,4 where\ndislocation-free 3D islands are strained to the same degree as the wetting layer.4,5,6 This is the reason why it is\nwidely accepted that the energy of the interfacial boundary between the 3D islands and the wetting layer is equal\nto zero.7 Although this energy is expected to be small\ncompared with that of the free crystal faces,8 it should\nnot be neglected since this is equivalent to the assumption that the islands wet completely the wetting layer.\nThe latter rules out 3D islanding from a thermodynamic\npoint of view.9\nThe need for a thermodynamic analysis arises also from\nthe experimental observations of a critical misfit for coherent 3D islanding to occur,10,11,12,13 and the simultaneous presence of islands of different thickness which vary\nby one monolayer.14,15 The existence of a critical misfit,\nas well as of stable two, three or four monolayers thick\nislands, do not follow from the tradeoff7,8\n\u2206E \u2248 C \u2032 \u03b3V 2/3 \u2212 C \u2032\u2032 \u03b520 V\n\n(1)\n\nbetween the cost of the additional surface energy and\n\nthe gain of energy due to the elastic relaxation of the 3D\nislands relative to the wetting layer (V , \u03b3 and \u03b50 are the\nislands volume, the specific surface energy and the lattice\nmisfit, respectively, and C \u2032 and C \u2032\u2032 are constants).\nIt was recently suggested that the TDF for coherent\n3D islanding is the incomplete wetting of the substrate\nby the islands,16 rather than the elastic relaxation of the\nmaterial in the islands. The incomplete wetting is due to\nthe displacements of the atoms near the island edges from\nthe bottoms of the corresponding potential troughs provided by the wetting layer. This results in a series of critical volumes at which the monolayer high islands become\nunstable against the bilayer islands, the bilayer islands\nagainst the trilayer islands, etc. The misfit dependence of\nthe first critical size N12 for the mono-bilayer transformation displays a critical behavior in the sense that coherent\n3D islands can be formed at a misfit higher than some\ncritical value. Below this value the film should grow in a\nlayer-like mode until misfit dislocations are introduced to\nrelieve the strain. However, the approximation used by\nthe authors, which is based on the 1D model of Frenkel\nand Kontorova,17,18 was unable to describe correctly the\nindividual behavior of atoms inside each layer, since it assumes a potential with a period given by the average of\nthe separations of atoms (considered frozen) in the layer\nunderneath. Although this model gives qualitatively reasonable results concerning the energy of the islands, it is\ninadequate to calculate, in particular, the average adhesion energy of the islands to the wetting layer.\nIn the present report we recollect some simple thermodynamic aspects of the epitaxial morphology based on\nthe traditional concept of wetting and consider the coherent SK growth from this point of view. The same\nconcepts were in fact advanced by Stranski in his model,\nadmittedly very peculiar, of a monovalent ionic crystal\nK+ A\u2212 on the surface of an isomorphous bivalent crystal\n\n\f2\nK2+ A2\u2212 .19 We then support our thermodynamic considerations by numerical calculations making use of a simple minimization procedure on the same atomistic model\nin 1 + 1 dimensions (length + height) as in Ref.(16).\nThe 3D islands are represented by linear chains of atoms\nstacked one upon the other,18 the islands height being\nthus considered as a discrete variable which increases by\nunity from one. The latter is of crucial importance as the\naspect ratio of the 3D islands is usually of the order of 0.1\nand the height is of the order of 10 monolayers.5,6 The\natoms interact through an anharmonic Morse potential\nV (x) = Vo [e\u221212(x\u2212b) \u2212 2e\u22126(x\u2212b) ].\n\n(2)\n\nThe total interaction energy as well as its derivatives\nwith respect to the atomic coordinates, i.e. the forces,\nare calculated. Relaxation is then performed iteratively\nby allowing the atoms to displace in the direction of the\nforces until these fall below some negligible cutoff value.\nWe consider interactions in the first coordination sphere\nin order to mimic the directional bonds that are characteristic for semiconductors.20 Inclusion of further coordination spheres alters only minimally the numerical\nresults. The substrate (the wetting layer) is assumed to\nbe rigid.\n\n0\n\n\u2206\u03bc = \u03bc(n) \u2212 \u03bc 3D\n\nVW\nSK\nFM\n\nWL\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nNumber of monolayers\n\nFIG. 1:\nSchematic dependence of the film chemical potential on the film thickness in number of monolayers for the\nthree modes of growth: VW \u2013 Volmer-Weber, SK \u2013 StranskiKrastanov, and FM \u2013 Frank-van der Merwe. The dashed line\ngives the chemical potential of the unstable wetting layer.\n\nA mother phase (a vapor) and a new phase (e.g. a\nstrained planar film or unstrained 3D crystals) are in\nequilibrium with each other when their chemical potentials are equal. A transition from one phase (mother or\nnew) to another takes place when the chemical potential of one of the phases becomes smaller than that of\nthe other. The TDF for this transition is the difference\nof the chemical potentials of both phases at the given\npressure and temperature. The TDF which determines\nthe occurrence of one or another mechanism of epitaxial\ngrowth (growth from vapor of a strained 2D layer or 3D\nislands) is the difference \u2206\u03bc = \u03bc(n) \u2212 \u03bc03D of the chemical potential, \u03bc(n), of the overlayer which depends on\nthe film thickness measured in number n of monolayers\ncounted from the interface, and the chemical potential,\n\n\u03bc03D , of the bulk 3D crystal of the same material.2,3 The\nthickness dependence of \u03bc(n) originates from the thickness distribution of the misfit strain and, on the other\nhand, from the interaction between the deposit and the\nsubstrate, which rapidly decreases with the distance from\nthe interface (EAB \u2192 EAA ).2,21\nIf we deposit a crystal A on the surface of a crystal B,\n\u2206\u03bc can be written in terms of the interatomic energies\nper atom, EAA and EAB , required to disjoin a half-crystal\nA from a like half-crystal A and from an unlike halfcrystal B, respectively:22\n\u03bc(n) = \u03bc03D + [EAA \u2212 EAB (n)] = \u03bc03D + EAA \u03a6.\n\n(3)\n\nThe adhesion energy EAB includes in itself the thickness distribution of the strain energy and the attenuation\nof the bonding with the substrate. \u03a6 = 1 \u2212 EAB /EAA is\nthe adhesion parameter which accounts for the wetting\nof the substrate by the overgrowth. Eq. (3) is equivalent\nto the familiar 3-\u03c3 criterion of Bauer.1,21\nAs follows from (3) the parameter \u03a6 = \u2206\u03bc/EAA is\nequal to the TDF for occurrence of one or another mode\nof growth relative to the cohesive energy EAA . In the\ntwo limiting cases of VW (0 < \u03a6 < 1) and FM growth\n(\u03a6 \u2264 0, \u03b50 \u2248 0), \u2206\u03bc tends asymptotically with increasing film thickness to zero from above and from below, respectively, but changes its sign in the case of SK growth\n(\u03a6 < 0, \u03b50 6= 0), as shown in Fig. 1.3,21 Consider now\nFig. 1 in terms of equilibrium vapor pressures instead of\nchemical potentials. Although the connection is straightforward, (\u03bc \u221d ln P ), such a consideration gives a deeper\ninsight into the problem.19 Thus, as long as \u03bc(n) < \u03bc03D\na thin planar film can be deposited at a vapor pressure P\nthat is smaller than the equilibrium vapor pressure, P0 ,\nof the bulk crystal, but is larger than the equilibrium vapor pressure P1 of the first monolayer, i.e. P1 < P < P0 .\nIn other words, a planar film can be deposited at undersaturation \u2206\u03bc = kT ln(P/P0 ) with respect to the bulk\ncrystal. The formation of 3D islands (\u03bc(n) > \u03bc03D ) requires P > P0 , or a supersaturation with respect to the\nbulk crystal.\nApplying the above considerations to the SK growth\nleads unavoidably to the conclusion that the 3D islands and the wetting layer represent necessarily different\nphases and thus have different chemical potentials. The\nreason is that the two phases are in equilibrium with\nthe mother phase (the vapor) under different conditions\nwhich never overlap. The wetting layer can be in equilibrium only with an undersaturated vapor phase (P < P0 ),\nwhile small 3D islands can be in equilibrium only with a\nsupersaturated vapor phase (P > P0 ). The dividing line\nis thus \u2206\u03bc = kT ln(P/P0 ) = 0 at which the wetting layer\ncannot grow thicker and the 3D islands cannot nucleate\nand grow. Hence the wetting layer and the 3D islands\ncan never be in equilibrium with each other.\nIt follows from the above that the derivative, d\u2206E/dV ,\nof the energy of the 3D islands relative to that of the wetting layer, gives the difference of the chemical potentials\nof the wetting layer (the dashed line in Fig. 1) and the\n\n\f3\n\ncoherent\ndislocated\n\n0.10\n\npositive misfit\nnegative misfit\n0.15\n\n0.10\n\n0.05\n\n0.00\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nIsland height (ML)\n\nFIG. 3: Mean adhesion parameter \u03a6 as defined by Eq.

The\nmisfit \u03b50 amounts to 7% and the islands contain 30 and 34\natoms in their base chains, respectively.\n\nWe focus our attention on the adhesion between the\n3D islands and the wetting layer. Fig. 2 is an illustration\nof the difference (and resemblance) between the classical and the coherent SK mode. In the calculations, the\nsizes of the base chain of the island (30 and 34 atoms,\nrespectively) have been chosen just below and above the\ncritical size for introduction of misfit dislocations at the\ngiven misfit of 7%. As seen, in both cases the 3D islands loose contact with the wetting layer. The vertical\ndisplacements are largest at the chain's ends in the coherent SK mode and around the dislocation cores in the\nclassical case, but the physics is essentially the same. The\nmean adhesion parameter \u03a6 increases with the islands'\nheight and saturates beyond several monolayers (Fig. 3).\nIn our model, \u03a6 is calculated as the adhesion energy between island and wetting layer at the given misfit (7%)\nminus the corresponding value for zero misfit. It can\nbe seen that the compressed overlayers exhibit a greater\ntendency to coherent SK growth than expanded ones as\nexpected, due to the anharmonicity of the potential (2).\nThe same tendency is seen more clearly in Fig. 4 which\nshows in fact the dependence of the TDF for formation of\ncoherent 3D islands, \u2206\u03bc, on the lattice misfit. The latter remains close to zero for expanded overlayers but increases steeply beyond approximately 5% in compressed\n\noverlayers. This behavior agrees well with the misfit dependence of the critical size, N12 , for the mono-bilayer\ntransformation to occur, as shown in Fig. 5, where a\nsteep rise of N12 with decreasing absolute value of the\nmisfit is observed only in compressed overlayers. Note\nthat it is less sharp for expanded ones opposite to earlier\nfinding.16\n0.4\n\nMean adhesion parameter \u03a6\n\nY displacement\n\n0.08\n\n0.20\n\nMean adhesion parameter \u03a6\n\nchemical potential of the 3D islands. In other words, it\nrepresents the difference of the supersaturations of the\nvapor phase with respect to the wetting layer and the\n3D islands. As the thickness and the energy of the wetting layer depend on the misfit it would be more suitable if one chooses as a reference the bulk crystal rather\nthan the wetting layer.23 Transfer of material from the\nstable wetting layer (\u03bcWL < \u03bc03D ) to the 3D islands is\nconnected with increase of the free energy of the system,\nand therefore, is thermodynamically unfavored. A planar film thicker than the stable wetting layer is unstable\nand the excess of the material can be transferred to the\n3D islands if the necessary thermal activation exists.\n\npositive misfit\nnegative misfit\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n\u22120.1\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nAbsolute value of misfit (%)\n\nFIG. 4: Mean adhesion parameter of one monolayer high,\ncoherent islands as a function of the lattice misfit.

The experimentally observed volume\nof the quantum dots varies roughly from 20000 to 50000\natoms.6,11 Typical values of the aspect ratio of the islands\nheight and half-base are of the order of 0.1.6,24 Thus a\npyramid with a base edge of 100 atoms and aspect ratio\n0.1, and containing 22000 atoms, is only 5 monolayers\nhigh.

The experimental observations mentioned above can be explained on the base of two assumptions: the thermodynamic driving force for the coherent\n3D islanding is the incomplete wetting and the height\nof the 3D islands is a discrete variable varying by one\nmonolayer. This leads to the results that (i) monolayer\nhigh islands with a critical size appear as necessary precursors for 3D islands, (ii) the 2D-3D transition takes\nplace through a series of intermediate states with discretely increasing thickness that are stable in separate\nintervals of volume (see Refs. (14,15)) (iii) there exists a critical misfit below which coherent 3D islands are\nthermodynamically unfavored (see Refs. (10,11,12,13))\nand the misfit is accommodated by misfit dislocations\nat a later stage of the growth. Compressed overlayers show a greater tendency to 3D clustering than expanded ones, in agreement with experimental results.10\nResult (i) explains readily why the volume distribution of\nInAs/GaAs self-assembled quantum dots agrees well with\nthe scaling functions for two-dimensional submonolayer\nhomoepitaxy model.25\nThe authors are indebted to the Instituto Universitario\nde Ciencia de Materiales \"Nicol\u00e1s Cabrera\" for granting research visits which enabled scientific collaboration.\nThis work was supported by the Spanish CICyT through\nproject Nr.
