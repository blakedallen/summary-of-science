Introduction\nOne of the standard questions addressed in the theory of Markov chains is the\ndistinction of transient and recurrent processes. By definition, a Markov chain is\ncalled recurrent, if almost every path comes back to its starting point, otherwise\ntransient. In this paper we discuss an analogous question for unitary quantum\ndynamics. Immediately, this presents us with a problem, which is typical for many\ngeneralizations of classical concepts to the quantum world: The definition as given\nfor Markov chains clearly requires some monitoring of the process: we have to\ncheck after every step whether the particle has returned. But this monitoring, if\nit is to give any non-trivial information about the system, necessarily changes the\ndynamics. Therefore, there are two options: We can either try to reformulate the\nproblem in such a way that the monitoring is not needed, or else we include the\nmonitoring into the description. An approach of the first kind has recently been\nput forward by \u0160tefa\u0148\u00e1k, Jex and Kiss [33] on the basis of a formula, which P\u00f3lya\nderived for Markov chains, and which is only based on the return probabilities, i.e.,\nthe probability for the particle to be back at a given time, without any conditions\non the path leading there. We call unitaries with specified initial state satisfying\nthe criterion [33] SJK-recurrent. In this paper we choose the second option. Our\nnotion of recurrence implies SJK-recurrence, but not conversely. We refrain from\ncomparing our definition with a host of other ones in the literature.\n1\n\nDepartment of Mathematics, University of California, Berkeley CA 94720\nDepartamento de Matem\u00e1tica Aplicada and IUMA, Universidad de Zaragoza, Mar\u0131\u0301a\nde Luna 3, 50018 Zaragoza, Spain\n3 Institut f\u00fcr Theoretische Physik, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover, Appelstr. 2, 30167\nHannover, Germany\nE-mail addresses: albertogrunbaum@yahoo.com,velazque@unizar.es,\nalbert.werner@itp.uni-hannover.de,reinhard.werner@itp.uni-hannover.de.\n2\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nRECURRENCE FOR DISCRETE TIME UNITARY EVOLUTIONS\n\nA common feature of these approaches is that the recurrence criterion depends\nonly on the unitary operator U and the initial state \u03c6, and hence only on the scalar\nmeasure \u03bc(du) = h\u03c6|E(du)\u03c6i on\nR the unit circle, which is obtained from the spectral measure E of U (so U = uE(du)). Ultimately, both criteria have a simple\nexpression in terms of properties of \u03bc. This connects the recurrence problem to a\nrich mathematical literature about measures on the unit circle and their orthogonal\npolynomials (the canonical review of the field is [30, 31]). The first return probabilities in our approach are the squared moduli of the Taylor coefficients of the\nso-called Schur function [28] of the measure, which so far did not seem to have a\ndirect dynamical interpretation. Our main result is that the process is recurrent iff\nthe Schur function is \"inner\", i.e., has modulus one on the unit circle. Furthermore,\nwe show that the winding number of this function has the direct interpretation as\nthe expected time of first arrival, which is hence an integer.\nWe came to this investigation through our respective work on quantum walks\n[4, 9, 8]. Quantum walks which are basically translation invariant (up to a local\nperturbation) are not recurrent, but the analysis of first returns is by no means\nlimited to deciding recurrence. We show how the methods developed in the quantum\nwalk context can be used to get explicit expressions in simple cases.\nOur paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we recapitulate the classical idea\nof recurrence and the quantum version by [33], and then propose our alternative\nbased on monitoring the dynamics. In Sect. 3 we give a spectral characterization of\nthis notion (Theorem 1) and, for the sake of comparison, a similar characterization\nfor the SJK-recurrence. The determination of the expected first return time is in\nTheorem 2 of Sect. 4: the main result is that the expectation of the first return time\nis, surprisingly, an integer or infinite. Again detailed results on the corresponding\nSJK-quantity are provided for comparison. Sect. 5 treats in more detail the finite\ndimensional case and shows, in particular, how the variance of the first return time\ndiverges when this integer value changes. Examples from the field of quantum walks\nare presented in Sect. 6. We provide two rather different methods for computing\nreturn probabilities, which however, have a large overlap of applicability. We close\nwith an outlook on some examples of singular spectrum and natural generalizations\nof our basic notion of recurrence.\n2. Notions of recurrence\nIn this section we compare our notion of recurrence to the one introduced by\n\u0160tefa\u0148\u00e1k, Jex and Kiss [33], which avoids introducing explicit monitoring steps.\nTheir idea is based on the theory of Markov chains, particularly the idea of recurrence as initiated by P\u00f3lya [25]. We briefly review this classical background [18]\nhere, partly to improve the understanding of [33], but chiefly as a basis to point\nout close analogies between the classical return probabilities and return amplitudes\narising later in our paper. After introducing our proposal we provide an example\ndemonstrating that the two approaches may come to opposite conclusions.\n2.1. The classical case. A (discrete time) Markov chain on a countable state\nspace X is defined by its transition probability matrix Pxy , where x, y \u2208 X. From\nthe interpretation of Pxy as the probability\nfor the process to move from x to y in\nP\none step it is clear that Pxy \u2265 0 and y Pxy = 1. Then the Markov property entails\nthat the probability for going from x to y along intermediate steps (x1 , . . . , xn\u22121 ) is\nPx,x1 Px1 ,x2 * * * Pxn\u22121 ,y . If we do not care for the intermediate steps these variables\n\n\fRECURRENCE FOR DISCRETE TIME UNITARY EVOLUTIONS\n\n3\n\nn\nare summed over, resulting in the matrix power Pxy\n. Now we single out a point\n0 \u2208 X. It will be the initial point for all paths we consider, and we are interested\nin the returns to 0. The probability to return in n steps is obviously\nX\nn\n(1)\npn = P00\n=\nP0,x1 Px1 ,x2 * * * Pxn\u22121 ,0 .\nx1 ,...,xn\u22121\n\nWe would also like to know the probability qn for this same transition subject to\nthe condition that no intermediate step is 0. That is,\nX\nP0,x1 Px1 ,x2 * * * Pxn\u22121 ,0\n(2)\nqn =\nx1 ,...,xn\u22121\nall6=0\n\nThese numbers are the probability law for the random variable first return time.\nClearly, (2) is the sum over just a subset of the terms in (1). If we split the sum\n(1) according to the highest index k at which xk = 0, we get a sum in which the\nsummation indices x` with ` < k are unconstrained, but those with ` > k must be\nnon-zero. In other words\nn\nX\n(3)\npn =\npk qn\u2212k ,\nk=0\n\nwhere for the endpoints we use the natural conventions p0 = 1 and q0 = 0. This\nformula is not valid for n = 0 (where it would give the wrong equation 1 = p0 =\np0 q0 = 0). Therefore, if we introduce the generating functions\n\u221e\n\u221e\nX\nX\n(4)\npb(z) =\npn z n and qb(z) =\nqn z n\nn=0\n\nn=0\n\nand sum over (3) (the n = 0 term has to be treated separately) we get\n(5)\n\npb(z) = 1 + pb(z)b\nq (z).\n\nHence the return probability or, more precisely, the probability to eventually return\nto the initial state 0, is now\nX\n1\n1\n(6)\nRC =\nqn = qb(1) = 1 \u2212\n=1\u2212 P\n.\np\nb\n(1)\nn pn\nn\nC\nTherefore\nP the Markov chain is recurrent from the point 0 if and only if R = 1, or\npb(1) = n pn = \u221e.\n\n2.2. Recurrence without monitoring. Now the criterion for recurrence proposed by [33] is to apply (6) to the sequence of quantum return probabilities\n(7)\n\npn = |h\u03c6|U n \u03c6i|2 .\n\nP\nSo a unitary U with initial state \u03c6 is called SJK-recurrent iff n pn = \u221e. It is\nclear that the entire computation leading up to the criterion in the Markov case,\nbeing based on conditioning, loses its significance in the quantum case. Also the\noperational meaning as the probability of some property of paths of the process\nis lost. ThereforeP\n[33] proposes an alternative operational\ncriterion, based on the\nQ\nobservation that n pn = \u221e is equivalent to n (1 \u2212 pn ) = 0. [33] defines the\nreturn probability RSJK by means of\n\u221e\nY\n(8)\nRSJK = 1 \u2212\n(1 \u2212 pn ).\nn=1\n\n\f4\n\nRECURRENCE FOR DISCRETE TIME UNITARY EVOLUTIONS\n\nOperationally, this corresponds to the following procedure [33]: \"Take a system and\nmeasure the position of the walker after one time step at the origin, then discard\nthe system. Take a second, identically prepared system and let it evolve for two\ntime steps, measure at the origin, then discard the system. Continue similarly for\narbitrarily long evolution time. The probability that the walker is found at the\norigin in a single series of such measurement records is the P\u00f3lya number [i.e.,\nRSJK ].\" This procedure is strange indeed. Imagine what it would mean in the\nparable of the prodigal son. The father is clearly interested in the return of his son,\nbut when he does not come back until year n, he sends out another son and asks\nwhether this one returns exactly in year n + 1, ignoring all earlier and later arrivals\nby this son, and indeed of all those sent before. While being rather wasteful of\nsons, it still does not provide an answer to the question \"Does every prodigal son\neventually return?\". Yet the procedure of [33] is probably the best we can do if\nwe want to avoid observing the quantum process. We will avoid such strangeness\nin our approach but, of course, this means that we must disturb the free evolution\nand explicitly describe the measurements.\n2.3. Arrival by absorption. Here we go the alternative route of explicitly introducing measurements to check the return of the system after every step.Starting at\n\u03c60 = \u03c6, one step thus consists of the unitary transformation \u03c6n \u2192 U \u03c6n followed by\nthe measurement of the projection |\u03c6ih\u03c6|. If this gives a positive result (for which\nthe probability is |h\u03c6|U \u03c6n i|2 ) the experiment is over. Otherwise the system is left\nin the state \u03c6n+1 = cn+1 (1I\u2212|\u03c6ih\u03c6|)U \u03c6n , where we choose cn+1 so that k\u03c6n+1 k = 1.\ne n \u03c6, where\nIn this iteration we will always have \u03c6n proportional to U\ne = (1I \u2212 |\u03c6ih\u03c6|)U.\nU\n\n(9)\n\ne n \u03c6/kU\ne n \u03c6k. The normalization factor sn = kU\ne n \u03c6k2 has\nHence we can set \u03c6n = U\nthe direct interpretation as the survival probability, i.e., for the walker to remain\nundetected for all steps including the nth . The probability for detection in step\nn, conditioned upon survival up to n \u2212 1 is |h\u03c6|U \u03c6n\u22121 i|2 . To get the absolute\nprobability for first detection in step n we have to multiply this with the survival\ne n\u22121 \u03c6k2 . With the normalization convention for \u03c6n\u22121 we get the first\nprobability kU\narrival probability in the form |an |2 , where an is the first arrival amplitude\n(10)\n\ne n\u22121 \u03c6i,\nan = h\u03c6|U U\n\nn \u2265 1.\n\nThe total probability for events up to and including the nth step, i.e., detection at\nstep k \u2264 n or survival, thus adds up as\n1=\n\nn\nX\n\ne n \u03c6k2 .\n|ak |2 + kU\n\nk=1\n\nThe return probability is therefore\n(11)\n\nR=\n\n\u221e\nX\nn=1\n\ne n \u03c6k2 .\n|an |2 = 1 \u2212 lim kU\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nAccordingly, we call the pair (U, \u03c6) recurrent if R = 1, and transient otherwise.\nThis notion, which is the subject of our paper is not equivalent to SJK-recurrence,\nas the following example shows.\n\n\fRECURRENCE FOR DISCRETE TIME UNITARY EVOLUTIONS\n\n5\n\nExample 1. Let us look at an elementary example, which demonstrates the difference between SJK-recurrence and the notion we introduced. The Hilbert space will\nbe H = C \u2295 `2 (Z), in which we will denote the basis vectors as |\u2217i and |xi, x \u2208 Z.\nThe unitary is defined by U |\u2217i = |\u2217i and U |xi = |x + 1i, and the initial state will\nbe \u03c6 = \u03b1|\u2217i + \u03b2|0i with |\u03b1|2 + |\u03b2|2 = 1. Clearly, we have\n(12)\n\nh\u03c6|U n \u03c6i = |\u03b1|2 (1 + \u03b4n0 ).\n\nen \u03c6 we can solve the recursion for the expansion coefficients, which\nTo determine U\ngives\nn\nX\ne n \u03c6 = \u03b1|\u03b2|2n |\u2217i + \u03b2 |ni \u2212 \u03b2|\u03b1|2\n(13)\nU\n|\u03b2|2(k\u22121) |n \u2212 ki\nk=1\n\nHence\n(14)\n\ne n \u03c6k2 =\nsn = kU\n\n|\u03b1|2 |\u03b2|2n\n2|\u03b2|2\n+\n1 + |\u03b2|2\n1 + |\u03b2|2\n\nThis converges to s\u221e = 2|\u03b2|2 /(1 + |\u03b2|2 ), which is non-zero whenever \u03b2 6= 0. In\nother words, according to our definition, the only recurrent case in this example\nis \u03c6 = |\u2217i, which does not move at all. All other cases are transient. In contrast,\npn = |h\u03c6|U n \u03c6i|2 = |\u03b1|4 for all n > 1, so RSJK = 1 unless \u03b1 = 0. Hence SJKrecurrence holds with the only exception of the initial state which moves according\nthe shift on `2 (Z).\n\u0003\n3. Spectral characterization of recurrence\n3.1. The mathematical setting. We have chosen our definition so that it only\ndepends on the pair (U, \u03c6) made up of a unitary operator on a Hilbert space H and a\nunit vector \u03c6 \u2208 H. It is clear from the definitions that only the subspace generated\nby the vectors U n \u03c6 plays a role. We may thus ignore parts of the Hilbert space never\nexplored by the evolution, and assume without loss that \u03c6 is cyclic for U . Similarly,\n(U, \u03c6) are only needed up to unitary equivalence, i.e., the pair (V U V \u2217 , V \u03c6) with V\nany unitary operator yields the same return probabilities. One invariant of pairs\n(U, \u03c6) under unitary equivalence is the \u03c6-expectation of the spectral measure of U .\nThis is the probability measure \u03bc on the unit circle S 1 = {u \u2208 C : |u| = 1}, defined\nby \u03bc(du) = h\u03c6|E(du)\u03c6i, where E is the spectral measure of U . Equivalently, we\ncan characterize the system by the moments of \u03bc, i.e., by the Fourier coefficients\nZ\n(15)\n\u03bcn = \u03bc(du) un = h\u03c6|U n \u03c6i, n \u2208 Z.\nThe measure \u03bc is, in fact, a complete invariant: We may choose as a canonical form\nof the pair (U, \u03c6) the Hilbert space H\u03bc = L2 (S 1 , \u03bc), the unitary U\u03bc of multiplication\nby the argument u, and the vector \u03c6\u03bc (u) = 1. These are equivalent to the original\nsetting by virtue of the operator V : H \u2192 H\u03bc defined by (V U n \u03c6)(u) = un , for\nn \u2208 Z, which is unitary because hU m \u03c6|U n \u03c6i = hum |un i = \u03bcn\u2212m .\nVarious functions have been introduced to characterize probability measures on\nthe unit circle, all of which are analytic for |z| < 1, and whose boundary values\nfor |z| \u2192 1 typically contain relevant information about the measure. We use the\nmoment generating or Stieltjes function\nZ\n\u221e\nX\n\u03bc(du)\nn\n(16)\n\u03bc\nb(z) =\n\u03bcn z =\n,\n1 \u2212 uz\nn=0\n\n\f6\n\nRECURRENCE FOR DISCRETE TIME UNITARY EVOLUTIONS\n\nthe Carath\u00e9odory function\nZ\n(17)\n\nF (z) =\n\n\u03bc(du)\n\nu+z\nb(z) \u2212 1,\n= 2\u03bc\nu\u2212z\n\nand the Schur function\n(18)\n\nf (z) =\n\n1 F (z) \u2212 1\n1 \u03bc\nb(z) \u2212 1\n=\n.\nz F (z) + 1\nz \u03bc\nb(z)\n\nHere we have used the convention that, for an analytic function g, the analytic\nfunction with the conjugated Taylor coefficients is denoted by g, i.e., g(z) = g(z).\nFor |z| < 1 we have\nZ\n1 \u2212 |zf (z)|2\n1 \u2212 |z|2\n=\n> 0,\n(19)\n<eF (z) = \u03bc(du)\n|u \u2212 z|2\n|1 \u2212 zf (z)|2\nand hence |f (z)| < 1, due to Schwarz's lemma. The Schur function thus maps the\nopen unit disk to itself. The proof that, conversely every analytic function on the\ndisc with <eF > 0 and F (0) = 1 (resp. |f | < 1) arises in this way from a probability\nmeasure \u03bc is the subject of classic papers by Caratheodory, Schur, Herglotz and\nmany others. For a lively discussion of the history we recommend Simon's book\n[30, Ch. 1.3, Notes].\nBoth f and F have radial limits g(eit ) = limr\u21921\u2212 g(reit ) for almost all t so\nthat we can consider that they are extended a.e. in the unit circle. The absolutely continuous part of \u03bc is supported on the points z \u2208 S 1 such that the radial\nlimit satisfies <eF (z) > 0, i.e., |f (z)| < 1. In fact, the density of the absolutely\ncontinuous part is given by (19). Therefore, the singular measures are characterized by the fact that the related Schur function is \"inner\", i.e. |f (z)| = 1 a.e. in\nS 1 [30]. The singular part of \u03bc is concentrated on the points z \u2208 S 1 such that\nlimr\u21921\u2212 <eF (rz) = \u221e, that is, zf (z) = 1. Concerning the pure point part of \u03bc,\nthe mass of any point z \u2208 S 1 is given by\n\u03bc({z}) = lim\u2212\nr\u21921\n\n1\u2212r\n1 \u2212 r 1 + rzf (rz)\nF (rz) = lim\u2212\n.\n2\n2 1 \u2212 rzf (rz)\nr\u21921\n\n3.2.

In our approach the renewal equation is\nused at the level of amplitudes, to pass from \u03bcn to the arrival amplitudes an , which\nare then squared to give the arrival probabilities. This is in keeping with Feynman's elementary exposition of the \"first principles of quantum mechanics\"[12],\nlosely speaking: \"In quantum theory add amplitudes and square at the end to\nget probabilities\". The continuous time limit of this idea is the root of his path\nintegrals, and indeed there is an approach to continuous time measurements in\nquantum mechanics [24] based on the selection of suitable subsets of paths in the\npath integral. On the other hand, Feynman also explains that when you monitor\n\n\f8\n\nRECURRENCE FOR DISCRETE TIME UNITARY EVOLUTIONS\n\nthe process (his example is a measurement near the double slit), you should first\nsquare and then add probabilities. This would identify our approach as a \"nonmonitoring\" one, in an apparent contradiction to our exposition in Sect. 2. It is\ndebatable whether the principle \"Add amplitudes where the classical theory would\nhave you add probabilities\", which works so beautifully in Feynman's Quantum\nMechanics 101, is really a fundamental law. In the end, it is Linear Algebra which\ncan give us a unified understanding of the two columns in our table: Both columns\nare based on the powers of a matrix in which the first row has been replaced by\nzeros: in the quantum case by multiplying with the projection 1I \u2212 |\u03c6ih\u03c6| and in the\nclassical case by disregarding all jumps to 0. The renewal equation depends only\non this, regardless of further structures such as unitarity and elementwise positivity\nof transition operators.\nWe remark that the above table suggests a reading of the SJK approach as \"take\nthe pn from quantum mechanics, and define qn by the renewal equation\". This does\nlead to the SJK-recurrence criterion. However, in the paper [33] the quantities qn\nare avoided, as described above after (8). The reason for this is not stated in the\npaper, but there is a good reason, which we discuss in Sect. 4.2: The qn can be\nnegative.\n3.3. The recurrence criterion. We can now utilize the identification\n(25) of the\nP\n2\ngenerating function b\na to turn the condition for recurrence, i.e.\n|a\n|\n= 1, into\nn\nn\na condition \u0001for the\nSchur\nfunction\nf\n.\nTo\nthis\nend\nwe\nfix\nr\n<\n1,\nand\nconsider\nthe\nP\nseries b\na reit = n rn an eitn as a Fourier series and use the Plancherel theorem:\nZ\nX\nr2 \u03c0\n2n\n2\ndt |f (re\u2212it )|2 .\n(26)\nr |an | =\n2\u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0\nn\nNow recall that the Schur function is bounded by 1, so for the limit of this expression\nas r \u2192 1 to be equal to the maximum 1 we must have that |f (reit )| \u2192 1 for almost\nall t. In other words, f has to be an inner function. As we pointed out, this has a\nsimple characterization directly in terms of the measure.\nTheorem 1. Consider a unitary operator U and an initial vector \u03c6. Then the\nfollowing are equivalent:\n(1) (U, \u03c6) is recurrent.\n(2) The Schur function f is inner.\n(3) \u03bc has no absolutely continuous part.\nRemark 1. Theorem 1 supplements known results about the interplay between the\npropagation properties of a state \u03c6 and its spectral measure. For example a corollary\nof the Riemann-Lebesgue-lemma states that a state with absolutely continuous\nspectral measure will eventually leave any finite region, which corresponds to the\nstatement of Theorem 1 that a state can only be recurrent and thereby returning\nto its initial starting point if its spectral measure contains no absolutely continuous\npart. In comparison to the famous RAGE theorem [22, 15, 26] which characterizes\nthe continuous and the pure point part of the spectral measure of a state by its\ndynamical properties our result distinguishes between its absolutely continuous and\nits singular part.\n3.4. A spectral view of classical and SJK-recurrence.\n\n\fRECURRENCE FOR DISCRETE TIME UNITARY EVOLUTIONS\n\n9\n\n3.4.1. Classical. Here is brief account of the use of the \"spectral method\" to analyze\nclassical random walks. Not all Markov chains with state space X can be analyzed\nin this fashion since the matrix Px,y can be very far from being symmetric.\nIt turns out that the class of Markov chains that can be put in self-adjoint form\nhas a nice description, namely they are the so-called reversible chains defined as\nthose for which there is a vector with positive components \u03c0x such that\n\u03c0x Px,y = Py,x \u03c0y .\nAssuming the existence of this vector one can introduce an inner product between\nfunctions f and g defined on X by the rule\nX\n(f, g)\u03c0 =\nfx g x \u03c0x .\nx\u2208X\n\nOne now checks easily that (P f, g)\u03c0 = (f, P g)\u03c0 which says that the matrix P\nis now symmetric with respect to such inner product and the spectral theory for\nself-adjoint (bounded) operators can be used to great advantage.\nFrom the spectral measure E of our self-adjoint operator one gets a spectral\nmeasure m(d\u03bb) = (\u03c8, E(d\u03bb)\u03c8)\u03c0 , supported in [\u22121, 1], for any probability distribution \u03c8x . The probability of going back to the same probability distribution \u03c8x in\nn steps is given by the moments of the spectral measure, namely,\nZ\nmn = m(d\u03bb) \u03bbn = (\u03c8, P n \u03c8)\u03c0 ,\nn = 0, 1, 2, . . .\nIn particular, the probability pn of returning to a given initial state 0 after n\nsteps coincides with the n-th moment of the spectral measure m for the distribution\nprobability \u03b4x,0 concentrated at x = 0. This identifies the generating function of\nthe return probabilities pn as the Stieltjes function of the measure m, i.e.,\nZ 1\n\u221e\nX\nm(d\u03bb)\n.\npn z n =\npb(z) =\n\u22121 1 \u2212 \u03bbz\nn=0\nWe finally have that the state 0 is recurrent exactly when\nZ 1\nm(d\u03bb)\n= \u221e.\n\u22121 1 \u2212 \u03bb\nBesides, using the renewal equation, we find that, in the recurrent case, the expected\ntime for the first return to this state is\n\u221e\nX\nd\n1 \u2212 qb(z)\n1\n1\nqb(z)\n= lim\n=\n.\n\u03c4C =\nnqn =\n= lim\nz\u21921 1 \u2212 z\nz\u21921 (1 \u2212 z)b\ndz\np\n(z)\nm({1})\nz=1\nn=1\nTherefore, the process returns to a state in a finite expected time exactly when its\nspectral measure has a mass at 1, and the expected return time is the inverse of\nthe corresponding mass.\nAll this shows that, classically, the recurrence properties of a state only depend\non the behavior of its spectral measure around the point 1.\n3.4.2. SJK. For the sake of comparison, we also give here a simple spectral characterization of SJK-recurrence, which is missing in [33] and was formulated in a\ndifferent way in [8]. Since\nZ\nn\n(27)\nh\u03c6|U \u03c6i = \u03bc(du) un = \u03bcn\n\n\f10\n\nRECURRENCE FOR DISCRETE TIME UNITARY EVOLUTIONS\n\nare just the Fourier coefficients of the measure, and \u03bc\u2212n = \u03bcn , the condition\n(28)\n\n\u221e\nX\nn=0\n\npn =\n\n\u221e\n1 1 X\n+\n|\u03bcn |2 < \u221e\n2 2 n=\u2212\u221e\n\nmeans, by the Plancherel Theorem, that \u03bc(du) = \u03c1(u) du for a function \u03c1 \u2208\nL2 (S 1 , \u03bd), where \u03bd denotes the uniform measure on the unit circle S 1 . Note that\nsince S 1 is compact, this is more restrictive than just absolute continuity, i.e., the\nexistence of an integrable density \u03c1. So we can summarize: A pair (U, \u03c6) fails to\nbe SJK-recurrent if and only if \u03bc is absolutely continuous with a square integrable\nprobability density.\n3.5. Dependence on the starting point. One feature, which makes P\u00f3lya's\ntheory of recurrence so useful is that, if the walk is irreducible, recurrence is independent of the starting point, hence a property of the walk itself. Here \"irreducible\"\nmeans [18] that from any point every other can be eventually reached with non-zero\nprobability, a property which is usually checked quite easily.\nIn the quantum case the natural analogue of \"the set of points reachable from\nstarting point x\" is \"the cyclic subspace generated by the initial vector \u03c6\", i.e., the\nspan of all U n \u03c6, which we will briefly denote by (U Z \u03c6)\u22a5\u22a5 . Now it is clear that\nin the quantum case no non-trivial unitary operator can be \"irreducible\", because\nthe spectral decomposition will generate many subspaces which cannot be reached\nfrom each other. Nevertheless, some degree of independence can be stated, and\nfollows immediately from Theorem 1.\nCorollary 1. Let \u03c60 \u2208 (U Z \u03c6)\u22a5\u22a5 and (U, \u03c6) recurrent. Then (U, \u03c60 ) is recurrent.\nNote that this is not true for SJK-recurrence. As a counterexample we can take\nExample 1, or any other where \u03bc has both pure point and absolutely continuous\ncomponents. This will be SJK-recurrent, but a suitable initial vector \u03c60 from the absolutely continuous subspace will be transient. A very similar argument shows that\nthe above corollary is not true for transience. It is also not true for SJK-transience:\nthis fails because even if \u03c6 is absolutely continuous with square integrable density,\n(U Z \u03c6)\u22a5\u22a5 will also contain vectors whose density is not square integrable.\nWe could also introduce a a notion of \"hereditary transience\" of (U, \u03c6) meaning\nthat all \u03c60 \u2208 (U Z \u03c6)\u22a5\u22a5 are transient. Clearly, this is equivalent to \u03bc being absolutely\ncontinuous. For hereditary transience the analogue of of the above corollary holds\nby definition. However, for the SJK version this is not an option (hereditary SJKtransience is vacuous). To complete the picture we might add that hereditary\nSJK-recurrence means that \u03bc has no absolutely continuous part, since that part\nwould contain also vectors with square integrable density. Hence hereditary SJKrecurrence is exactly equivalent to recurrence in our sense.\n3.6. An inverse problem. A famousPresult in the classical case [37] states that any\nsequence qn with qn \u2265 0, q0 = 0 and n qn = 1 can be the sequence of first return\nprobabilities of a Markov chain. Here we discuss the analogous questions in the\nquantum case. It is clear from Bochner's theorem that the sequences \u03bcn = h\u03c6|U n \u03c6i2\nare exactly the positive definite ones with \u03bc0 = 1: the kernel kn,m = \u03bcn\u2212m has to\nbe positive definite, where we set \u03bc\u2212n = \u03bcn for n > 0. Equivalently, the sequence of\nToeplitz determinants [30] is positive. Clearly, by expressing the \u03bcn in terms of the\n\n\fRECURRENCE FOR DISCRETE TIME UNITARY EVOLUTIONS\n\n11\n\nan this implies a hierarchy of conditions on the an . The first few look encouragingly\nsimple:\n1 \u2212 |a1 |2\n\n(29)\n\n2 2\n\n(1 \u2212 |a1 | ) \u2212 |a2 |2\n\n(30)\n(31)\n\n2 3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n(1 \u2212 |a1 | ) \u2212 (1 \u2212 |a1 | )(2|a2 | + |a3 | ) + |a2 |\n\n\u2265\n\n0\n\n\u2265\n\n0\n\n\u2265\n\n2<e a2 a1 a3\n\n\u0001\n\nThese already suffice to answer some basic questions. First of all, we see that\nthere is no quantum analog of the Yosida-Kakutani Theorem cited above: there are\nnon-trival constraints on the sequence of first return probabilities. From (30), in\nparticular, we see that the set of admissible sequences |an |2 is not convex. Finally,\nthe Toeplitz determinant constraints cannot be expressed in terms of the absolute\nvalues of the an alone. So even from the whole hierarchy of such inequalities it is\nnot trivial to extract the precise constraints for the |an |.\n4. Expected return time in the recurrent case\n4.1. It is an integer. Consider a recurrent pair (U, \u03c6). Its first arrival probabilities\n|an |2 are then a normalized probability distribution on N. What are its features?\nPerhaps the first quantity to look at is the expected return time, i.e.,\n(32)\n\n\u03c4=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n|an |2 n.\n\nn=1\n\nIt turns out that \u03c4 can be computed from the measure very easily and turns out to\nbe always an integer or infinite. This is surprising, because the an clearly depend\ncontinuously on the measure \u03bc, so a small change in \u03bc could be expected to also\nchange \u03c4 only a little. Our aim is therefore not just to prove this statement but to\nmake it intuitive by giving \u03c4 a topological interpretation.\nTheorem 2. Let (U, \u03c6) be a recurrent pair with spectral measure \u03bc, Schur function\nf and expected return time \u03c4 \u2208 R+ \u222a {\u221e}. Then the following are equivalent\n(1) \u03c4 < \u221e.\n(2) f is a rational function.\n(3) \u03bc is equal to the sum of n < \u221e distinct point measures with non-zero\nweights.\nMoreover, \u03c4 = n, and the polynomial degree of numerator and denominator of the\nSchur function is n \u2212 1.\nWe will prove the implications (3)\u21d2(2)\u21d2(1) emphasizing the narrative of ideas\nleading to the identification \u03c4 = n. The slightly more technical implication (1)\u21d2(3)\nis given in a separate, slightly more formal style.\nIt is clear from (16) that \u03bc\nb = P/Q is the quotient of two polynomials P, Q of\ndegrees (n \u2212 1), n, respectively. Then we can write f as R/P with R = (P \u2212 Q)/z.\nR is a polynomial, because P (0)/Q(0) = 1, and hence P \u2212 Q has no constant term.\nClearly, its degree is also n \u2212 1. R and P have no common zeros, since these would\nbe common zeros of P and Q, contradicting the observation that \u03bc\nb has n distinct\npoles on the unit circle. This proves (2).\nNow observe that f is a rational function which, as an inner function, must have\nmodulus one on the unit circle, and hence the generating function (25) of the arrival\n\n\f12\n\nRECURRENCE FOR DISCRETE TIME UNITARY EVOLUTIONS\n\namplitudes\ng(t) = eit f (eit ) =\n\n(33)\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nan eint\n\nn=1\n\nhas modulus one for all real t. So g(t) winds around the origin an integer number\nw(g) of times as t goes from 0 to 2\u03c0.

Hence we have a topological interpretation of the\nexpected return time \u03c4 , which already makes clear that it must be an integer. We\nremark that this connection was found in a totally different context by H. Brezis\nfollowing a hint by I. M. Gelfand [7].\nTo determine this integer we use the Blaschke factorization, which decomposes\na rational inner function into a product of the form\n(36)\n\nf (z) = \u03b2\n\nn\u22121\nY\nk=1\n\n\u03b1k \u2212 z\n1 \u2212 \u03b1k z\n\nwith |\u03b1k | < 1 and |\u03b2| = 1. The \u03b1k are exactly the zeros of f inside the unit circle,\nwhich by the reflection principle must be matched by poles at 1/\u03b1k outside the\ncircle. The upper limit of the product expresses our previous analysis of the degrees\nof the rational function f . Now the winding number of a product of several functions\nis clearly the sum of the winding numbers. Each of the Blaschke factors contributes\n1. Indeed, the winding number of a single factor clearly depends continuously on\n\u03b1, so must be constant, and we may set \u03b1 = 0 (i.e., f (z) = z) to evaluate it.\nObserving that the generating function (25) contains an additional factor z we get\n\u03c4 = w(g) = n, proving (1).\nBefore proving the remaining implication, let us see how a small additional point\nmass changes the Schur function and the arrival time distribution. An example is\nshown in Fig. 1. It is based on the sum of two point masses at u = 1 and u = i. We\nadd a small point mass at u = \u22121 by convex combination with a small weight \u03b5.\nThis leads to an additional zero of f close to z = \u22121, and a full turn of the phase\nnear that point. The interval in which this turn happens is of order \u03b5. Thus for\nfixed low n the contribution to the Fourier integral for an is negligible. For higher\nn it becomes visible, and the unit contribution to the expected return time comes\nfrom the large n Fourier coefficients. We will discuss this in more detail in Sect. 5.\nProof of Theorem 2, part (1)\u21d2(3):\nWe prove this by contradiction, i.e., we show that for non-rational inner functions\n\n\fRECURRENCE FOR DISCRETE TIME UNITARY EVOLUTIONS\n\n13\n\nFigure 1.

Indeed, Frostman proved that\nthis statement holds for almost all \u03b1 (outside a set of null capacity), but one \u03b1 will\nbe enough for us. Since f (z) = (\u03b1 \u2212 f\u03b1 (z))/(1 \u2212 \u03b1f\u03b1 (z)), the two functions satisfy\nthe estimate\n(43)\n\n1 \u2212 |f (z)|2 =\n\n1 \u2212 |\u03b1|\n1 \u2212 |\u03b1|2\n(1 \u2212 |f\u03b1 (z)|2 ) \u2265\n(1 \u2212 |f\u03b1 (z)|2 ).\n|1 \u2212 \u03b1f\u03b1 (z)|2\n1 + |\u03b1|\n\nHence from (39),\n\u03c4 (f ) \u2265 1 +\n\n(44)\n\n1 \u2212 |\u03b1|\n(\u03c4 (f\u03b1 ) \u2212 1).\n1 + |\u03b1|\n\nNow f\u03b1 is a Blaschke product. If it is finite, then f is rational and hence itself\na finite Blaschke product, a case already covered.

Although absent in SJK papers, a\ndefinition of expected return time can be given for the SJK approach too. Let us\nbegin with a seemingly natural approach which, however, turns out not to work.\nRecall P\u00f3lya's Theory from Sect. 2: it allowed the determination of the probabilities\nqn for first return in n steps from the probabilities pn to be back at time n. Since\nthe SJK-approach is based on applying P\u00f3lya's criterion to the pn as computed from\nquantum mechanics, we already have a candidate for qn and hence the expected\nreturn time via the renewal equation (5). We get (compare also Sect. 3.4.1)\n\u0011\u22121\n1 \u2212 qb(z) \u0010\n= lim (1 \u2212 z)b\np(z)\n.\nz\u21921 1 \u2212 z\nz\u21921\nz=1\nP\nIf the measure consists of finite point masses the \u03bcn are given by k mk exp(i\u03b8k n)\nand we can further evaluate (45) to\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\u22121\n!\u22121\nX\nX\n1\n\u2212\nz\n\uf8f8 =\n(46)\n\u03c4 Polya = \uf8ed lim\nmk ml\nm2k\n.\ni(\u03b8k \u2212\u03b8l )\nz\u21921\n1\n\u2212\nze\nk,l\nk\n(45)\n\n\u03c4 Polya =\n\ndb\nq (z)\ndz\n\n= lim\n\nWe hasten too add that in the quantum case \u03c4 Polya has no operational meaning at\nall. What is worse, the \"first return probabilities\" qn on which it is based need not\nbe probabilities at all (see Example 2).\nTherefore, in the spirit of [33], we build a notion of expected return time on the\nprocess described after (8): It is a Markov process with state space 0, 1, . . ., such\nthat from a state n > 0 one goes to 0 with probability pn , and to n + 1 otherwise.\nThe probability for first return to 0 in n steps and the corresponding expected\n\n\fRECURRENCE FOR DISCRETE TIME UNITARY EVOLUTIONS\n\n15\n\nreturn time are thus\nqnSJK\n\n= pn\n\nn\u22121\nY\n\n(1 \u2212 pk ),\n\nk=1\n\n\u03c4 SJK\n\n(47)\n\n=\n\nX\n\nn qnSJK ,\n\nn\n\nq0SJK\n\nq1SJK\n\nP\nwith\n= 0 and\n= p1 . As discussed above, this adds up to n qnSJK = RSJK .\nFor a given pair (U, \u03c6) we thus get three sets of \"first return probabilities\": the\n|an |2 with the first return amplitudes an from (10), and two sets based on the\nprobabilities pn = |h\u03c6|U n \u03c6i|2 , namely qnSJK after (47) and qn after Sect. 2.1. The\nfollowing example shows that all three notions can actually lead to different values\nfor the same dynamical system.\nExample 2. In the Hilbert space C2 consider as the unitary operator U the real\nrotation matrix by some angle \u03b8 and choose the vector \u03c6 = (1, 0) as the initial state.\nThe corresponding spectral measure consists of two mass points of equal weights\n1/2 at exp(\u00b1i\u03b8), which corresponds to the Schur function\n(48)\n\nf (z) =\n\ncos(\u03b8) \u2212 z\n.\n1 \u2212 cos(\u03b8)z\n\nGiven the Schur function, we can calculate the three series of first return probabilities |an |2 , qnSJK and qn . In Fig. 2 these three are shown together for \u03b8 = \u03c0/4. In\nthat particular case U 2 \u03c6 = (0, 1), so \u03bc2 = h\u03c6|U 2 \u03c6i = 0, and pn = 1, 1/2, 0, 1/2, . . .\nrepeated ad infinitum. Now this cannot be the return probability sequence of any\nMarkov chain: If there is a non-zero probability to stay at site 0 for one step, this\nprobability must be non-zero for all n. So p2 = 0 is impossible classically. In the\njargon of quantum information theory the unitary we have chosen is called a square\nroot of the NOT gate [6], since U 2 swaps the two bit values, a feat which cannot\nbe realized by two equal classical probabilistic steps. Indeed, q2 = \u22121/4, and the\nsum of all the negative qn is around \u22120.77. It is also clear from Fig. 2 that there is\n\nFigure 2. The figure shows the first return probabilities (left\npanel) and the accumulated first return probabilities (right panel)\nfor \u03b8 = \u03c0/4. The three curves correspond to the first return probabilities given by |an |2 (thick), qnSJK (long dashed) and qn (short\ndashed).\nno general inequality connecting the first returns in the SJK approach and in our\napproach: which of the two gives higher probability for the event \"arrival before t\"\nmay depend on t.\n\n\f16\n\nRECURRENCE FOR DISCRETE TIME UNITARY EVOLUTIONS\n\nFigure 3. Dependence of the expected return times \u03c4 = \u03c4 Polya\n(thick) and \u03c4 SJK (dashed, first 400 summands) on the rotation\nangle \u03b8 (for \u03b8 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0, 0] the graph shows the same behavior).\nTo see that this is also true for the expected return times we evaluate the expressions for \u03c4 , \u03c4 Polya and \u03c4 SJK for this example. Since the overlap of \u03c6 = (1, 0) with\nthe two eigenvectors of U is independent of the rotation angle \u03b8, Theorem 2 tells us\nthat \u03c4 equals the number of distinct eigenvalues of U . This amounts to \u03c4 = 2 for\nall \u03b8 except the singular cases 0 and \u00b1\u03c0, where U has two equal eigenvalues and\ntherefore \u03c4 is 1. Since both mass points have equal weights 1/2 equation (46) for\n\u03c4 Polya gives the same result.\nTo determine \u03c4 SJK we have to evaluate (47) which, since pn = cos2 (n\u03b8) holds,\namounts to\nn\nXY\n\u03c4 SJK = 1 +\nsin2 (k\u03b8).\nn\u22651 k=1\n\nFig. 3 shows the two curves of the three expected return times \u03c4 , \u03c4 Polya and \u03c4 SJK\ndepending on the rotation angle. By varying \u03b8, we find that \u03c4 < \u03c4 SJK as well as\n\u03c4 SJK < \u03c4 can be realized. In addition by choosing an initial state \u03c6 that does not\nhave equal overlap with both eigenvectors also \u03c4 Polya < \u03c4 SJK can be realized. \u0003\nWe have seen that a single point measure contribution in \u03bc makes a process\nSJK-recurrent.

Our plan in this section\nis to give a more detailed account of the changes in the return probability when n\nchanges and hence the expected return time \u03c4 = n jumps. In particular, we will\nshow that at these points the variance of the first return diverges. We begin with\na formula for the variance in terms of the zeros zj of f .\nP\nk\u22121\nProposition 2.

For the sake of this proof, however, it is easier to omit the complex\nconjugate, which is anyhow irrelevant in (50), and to shift\nPthe sequence an so that\nthe an are really the Taylor coefficients of f . Note that k k|ak |2 = n \u2212 1 is then\nthe number of zeros.\nFrom the Blaschke product (36) we get\nX\u0010 \u22121\n\u2212zj \u0011\nf0\n=\n\u2212\n.\n(51)\nf\nzj \u2212 z\n1 \u2212 zj z\nj\nSince |f | = 1 on the unit circle, we can express the second moment as\nZ 2\u03c0\nZ 2\u03c0\n2\n2\nX\nd\u03b8 df (ei\u03b8 )\nd\u03b8\nf0\nk 2 |ak |2 =\n=\niei\u03b8\nd\u03b8\nf\n0 2\u03c0\n0 2\u03c0\nk\n\n2\n\nI\n(52)\n\n=\n\ndz X 1\nzj\n+\n2\u03c0iz j z \u2212 zj\n1 \u2212 zj z\n\n,\n\n\f18\n\nRECURRENCE FOR DISCRETE TIME UNITARY EVOLUTIONS\n\nwhere the circle indicates complex integration around the unit circle. Writing the\nabsolute value as X X we combine the factor X with the factor 1/z. Then, using\n|z|2 = 1, all denominators are linear in z.

This gives the expression stated in the proposition.\n\u0004\nThe expression (50) is positive, because we can write it as\n(55)\n\nV\u03c4 = 2\n\n\u221e n\u22121\nX\nX\n\n2\n\nzks\n\n.\n\ns=1 k=1\n\nP s\nThis can vanish only if\nk zk = 0 for\nQ all s. But since by Newton's relations\n[23] the coefficients of the polynomial k (z \u2212 zk ), i.e., the elementary symmetric\nfunctions of (z1 , . . . , zn\u22121 ), can be expressed in terms of the sums of powers, the\nequation for the zk can only be z n\u22121 = 0. In other words, V\u03c4 = 0 implies that\nf (z) = \u03b2z n\u22121 , |\u03b2| = 1, corresponding to n equal point masses at the n-th roots of\n\u03b2 \u2208 S 1 . This should not surprise us: It corresponds precisely to a \"clock\" unitary,\nwhich cyclically rotates n basis states, of which one is the initial state. Clearly, this\nreturns to the origin after exactly n steps. For fixed n, small variance still implies\nthat all zk are small.\nIn the opposite direction, suppose that one of the zeros, say z1 , approaches the\nunit circle, while the others are fixed. Then the term with ` = j = 1 in (50)\ndiverges, while all other terms stay finite. Hence V\u03c4 \u2192 \u221e. Characteristically this\nhappens when the number n of point measures, and hence the number of zeros\nchanges its value. Indeed this could happen either by fusion, when two points\nconverge to each other (e.g., un \u2192 un\u22121 ), or by a shrinking, when the weight of\none point goes to zero (e.g., mn \u2192 0). In either case we get a weakly convergent\nsequence of measures for which n changes in the limit. But by weak convergence the\nsequence of Schur functions converges uniformly on every disk of radius (1\u2212\u03b5). This\nimplies that the number of zeros of the Schur function in any such disc converges.\nIn other words, the change in the number of zeros can only happen by one zero\nconverging to the unit circle, which entails V\u03c4 \u2192 \u221e, as we have seen. When the\nchange in the measure is localized near one point, as for fusion and shrinking, then\nthe uniform convergence argument also holds for a neighborhood of other parts of\nthe unit circle, and we can even say that the vanishing zero has to converge to the\npoint with shrinking weight (as shown in Fig. 1) or to the fused point.\nOne source of intuition for such connections between the point measures and the\nSchur zeros is the following electrostatic interpretation. Although it is stated for\n\n\fRECURRENCE FOR DISCRETE TIME UNITARY EVOLUTIONS\n\n19\n\nfinite sums of mass points, which is the case under study in this section, it can be\neasily generalized to infinitely supported measures too.\nLemma 1. Consider P\na measure \u03bc on the unit circle, which\nP is a finite sum of point\nn\nmeasures, so \u03bc\nb(z) = i=1 mi /(1 \u2212 ui z) with mi > 0,\ni mi = 1, and |ui | = 1.\nThen the zeros z1 , . . . , zn\u22121 of the Schur function are precisely the stationary points\nof the two-dimensional electrostatic potential\n(56)\n\nV (z) =\n\nn\nX\n\nmi log ui \u2212 z .\n\ni=1\n\nIn particular, all zk lie in the convex hull of the ui .\nThe mi are the point charges of this electrostatic system located at the ui . So\neach of the point masses generates a repulsive force field. If one of the charges mi\nis small, there will be a stationary point close to this charge at ui , as seen in Fig. 1.\nThe convex hull of the ui is indicated in red in Fig. 1.\nProof : Clearly, by (18) the zeros of f are those of\n\u0013 X\n\u0012\n\u0011 1X\nX mi\nmi ui\n1\u0010\n1\n\u22121 =\n=\n.\n\u03bc\nb(z) \u2212 1 =\nmi\nz\nz i\n1 \u2212 ui z\n1 \u2212 ui z\nui \u2212 z\ni\ni\nIt is easily verified that this is equal to\n\u2202V (x + iy)\n\u2202V (x + iy)\n+i\n\u2202x\n\u2202y\nso at the zeros of f the gradient of V vanishes.

We\nchoose the zeros to be zj = \u03bbe2\u03c0ik/(n\u22121) , for k = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1.

Examples with absolutely continuous measures\nIn this section we deal with transient pairs (U, \u03c6), i.e., those whose spectral\nmeasure \u03bc has an absolutely continuous part. We focus on ways to get the first\nreturn probabilities |an |2 or at least their sum, the total return probability\n\nR=\n\n\u221e\nX\nn=1\n\n|an |2 =\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u2212\u03c0\n\ndt\n|f (eit )|2 = kf k2 .\n2\u03c0\n\nA typical class of such models are so-called quantum walks, i.e., systems with a\ndiscrete spatial degree of freedom, which in each step can change only by a finite\ndistance. There is a new interest in quantum walks coming from recent experimental\nrealizations [19]. These systems were also the motivation for [33], as well as for us.\nThis section is therefore split between two approaches to quantum walks, which\nhave their characteristic strengths, but also a large overlap.\nThe first method, introduced by two of us (F.A.G. and L.V.) with coauthors\n[8, 9] builds on a method turning any pair (U, \u03c6) into a quantum walk. This walk\nmost naturally lives on Z+ = {0, 1, 2, . . . }, although it can be extended to deal with\nZ. It almost always has position dependent steps. When the dynamics is periodic\nfrom some site onwards, one can determine the Schur function by a fixed point\nequation, which typically gives absolutely continuous spectrum plus some discrete\neigenvalues related to the initial segment.\nThe second method is designed for strictly translation invariant systems in any\nlattice dimension. It has been introduced in [16] and was used by two of us (A.H.W.\nand R.F.W.) with coauthors [4] for getting the asymptotic position distribution\neven in the presence of time dependent noise. The core of the method is the\njoint diagonalization of U and the translations, which amounts to diagonalizing a\nmomentum dependent matrix. Finite range spatial variations in the dynamics can\nbe dealt with via perturbation theory [1], which again produces additional discrete\neigenvalues analogous to the introduction of impurities into a periodic potential.\nBoth methods apply to so-called \"coined walks\" in one dimension, which live on\nthe Hilbert space `2 (Z) \u2297 C2 , whose basis vectors we write as |x, \u03b1i, x \u2208 Z, and\n\u03b1 \u2208 {\u2191, \u2193}. The time step unitary is factorized into \"shift\" and \"coin\" U = SC with\nS|x, \u2191i = |x + 1, \u2191i and S|x, \u2193i = |x \u2212 1, \u2193i, and a coin operation, which acts at each\nsite x separately as a 2 \u00d7 2 unitary matrix Cx on |x, li. The translation invariant\ncase corresponds to a site independent coin Cx \u2261 C0 , and will be treated in both\napproaches. In contrast to the classical result of P\u00f3lya, who found recurrence for\none dimensional unbiased nearest neighbor random walks the coined quantum walks\nare \u221a\nalways transient. Intuitively, this may be related to the much slower spreading\n(\u223c t rather than \u223c t) of the classical walks: they just spend more time close to\nhome.\n\n6.1. Return probability from orthogonal polynomials. How can we turn any\npair (U, \u03c6) into a quantum walk? The basic idea is to build a basis of the Hilbert\nspace from the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization of the sequence \u03c6, U \u22121 \u03c6, U \u03c6,\nU \u22122 \u03c6, U 2 \u03c6, . . ., which is equivalent to building the \u03bc-orthogonal Laurent polynomials on the unit circle. This leads to a canonical five-diagonal matrix representation\n\n\fRECURRENCE FOR DISCRETE TIME UNITARY EVOLUTIONS\n\n21\n\nof U , a so-called CMV matrix [10, 30, 32, 35]\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03b30\n\uf8ec \u03c10 \u03b3 1\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec \u03c10 \u03c11\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0\nC=\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed 0\n...\n\n\u03c10\n\u2212\u03b30 \u03b3 1\n\u2212\u03b30 \u03c11\n0\n0\n0\n0\n...\n\n0\n\u03c11 \u03b3 2\n\u2212\u03b31 \u03b3 2\n\u03c12 \u03b3 3\n\u03c1 2 \u03c13\n0\n0\n...\n\n0\n\u03c11 \u03c12\n\u2212\u03b31 \u03c12\n\u2212\u03b32 \u03b3 3\n\u2212\u03b32 \u03c13\n0\n0\n...\n\n0\n0\n0\n\u03c13 \u03b3 4\n\u2212\u03b33 \u03b3 4\n\u03c14 \u03b3 5\n\u03c14 \u03c15\n...\n\n\uf8f6\n...\n. . .\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n. . .\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n. . .\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n. . .\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n. . .\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n. . .\uf8f8\n...\n\n0\n0\n0\n\u03c1 3 \u03c14\n\u2212\u03b33 \u03c14\n\u2212\u03b34 \u03b3 5\n\u2212\u03b34 \u03c15\n...\n\n|\u03b3k | < 1,\np\n\u03c1k = 1 \u2212 |\u03b3k |2 .\n\nThen the pair (C, e0 ), with e0 = (1, 0, 0, . . . )t the first canonical basis vector is\nunitarily equivalent to (U, \u03c6).\nThe coefficients \u03b3k are called the Schur parameters of f or the Verblunsky coefficients of the measure \u03bc [34, 30].

Khrushchev [21] it is closely\nrelated to the pair (C, ek ) starting at the basis vector ek , which has the Schur\nfunction fk Bk , where Bk is a finite Blaschke product. Hence kfk k2 is equal to the\ntotal return probability starting from ek .\nCoined walks on Z+ are a special case of this general construction, namely the\ncase that the odd Schur parameters \u03b32x+1 vanish.

We will assume from now on that |\u03b32x | < 1,\nwhich makes the walk \"irreducible\", i.e., there is no finite interval in x which is\ndecoupled from its complement.\nBecause the odd Schur parameter vanish the iteration (58) gives f2x (z) = z \u22121 f2x\u22121 (z).\nWe conclude that the states |x \u2212 1, \u2193i and |x, \u2191i of an irreducible two-state quantum\nwalk on Z+ have the same return probability, and this return probability does not\ndepend on the coins Cy , y < x.

As an example we will consider a quantum walk with a constant coin of the form (60) with \u03b32x \u2261 \u03b3 constant.\nThe Schur parameters are \u03b3, 0, \u03b3, 0, \u03b3, 0, . . . and hence the sequence of Schur iterates fk is periodic with period L = 2 [8, 9]. Therefore it satisfies a fixed point\nequation for a composition of L steps of Schur iteration. In our case f = f2 is just\na quadratic equation, which has the solution\np\nz 2 \u2212 1 + (z 2 \u2212 1)2 + 4|\u03b3|2 z 2\n.\n(61)\nf (z) =\n2\u03b3z 2\nThe branch of the square root is that one converging to 1 when z \u2192 0.\nThe measure related to f , i.e. the spectral measure of the cyclic vector |0, \u2191i,\nhas a weight and a mass point which is absent only when the coin is symmetric\n[8].

The upper curve corresponds to a constant coin on the\nnon-negative integers, the lower one on the integers.\nWe can summarize stating that the recurrence properties for a constant coin\non Z or Z+ are similar, but the recurrence is slightly more prominent when the\ntranslation invariance is broken by the boundary conditions in Z+ .\n6.2. Return times by the Fourier method. This method was developed for\ntranslationally invariant quantum walks [16, 4]. In this sense it is much more\nspecial than the CGMV method described above, but has the advantage that it\nworks just as well in higher lattice dimension, and with an arbitrary initial state,\nwithout the need to recompute the Verblunsky coefficients. Moreover, the Fourier\nmethod has been extended to certain decoherent walks and interacting two-particle\nsystems [4, 2, 1].\nThe Hilbert space is now `2 (Zs ) \u2297 K, where s \u2208 N is the dimension of the underlying spatial lattice, and K is the space of internal degrees of freedom at each site\nx. We only assume that U is unitary on this Hilbert space, and commutes with the\nlattice translations. Often it is made part of the definition of a quantum walk that\nit has strictly finite propagation in each step, but we will not need this condition\nhere. Therefore, we can jointly diagonalize U with the translations by a Fourier\ntransform in the spatial variable, which means that the Hilbert space vectors are\nnaturally considered as K-valued functions of the Fourier variable \"momentum\"\np = (p1 , . . . , ps ) \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0]s . In this representation U becomes multiplication by\n\n\f24\n\nRECURRENCE FOR DISCRETE TIME UNITARY EVOLUTIONS\n\na p-dependent unitary operator on K, denoted by U (p). The assumption of finite propagation speed would imply that the matrix elements of U (p) are Laurent\npolynomials in the variables exp(ipk ).\nThen for any initial vector \u03c6 we get the Stieltjes function (16)\nZ\n\u22121\n(64)\n\u03bc\nb(z) = h\u03c6|(1 \u2212 zU ) |\u03c6i = dp h\u03c6(p)|(1 \u2212 zU (p))\u22121 |\u03c6(p)i\nWhen the starting point is the origin, \u03c6(p) \u2261 \u03c6 \u2208 K is independent of p, and we\ncan evaluate the integral as \u03bc\nb(z) = h\u03c6|M (z)|\u03c6i, with the Stieltjes operator\nZ\n(65)\nM (z) = dp (1 \u2212 zU (p))\u22121 .\nFor a coined one-dimensional quantum walk with the same coin as in Sect. 6.1.1\nthe walk operator takes the form\n\u0013\n\u0012 ip\n\u0013\u0012\ne\n0\n\u03c1 \u2212\u03b3\n(66)\n.\nU (p) = S(p) * C =\n\u03b3 \u03c1\n0 e\u2212ip\nThe integral (65) can be evaluated by the residue theorem and gives\n!\n1 \u2212 z 2 + g(z)\n\u2212 \u03b3\u03c1 (1 + z 2 \u2212 g(z))\n1\n(67)\n.\nM (z) =\n\u03b3\n1 \u2212 z 2 + g(z)\n2g(z) \u03c1 (1 + z 2 \u2212 g(z))\np\nwith g(x) = (1 \u2212 z 2 )2 + 4|\u03b3|2 z 2 . From this we can immediately write down the\nSchur function and compute the total return probability R as the 2-norm. In\nagreement with Sect. 6.1.2 the cases \u03c6 = | \u2191i and \u03c6 = | \u2193i give the same result (63),\nbecause the diagonal elements of M (z) are equal. However, for starting/absorbing\nstates \u03c6 which are superpositions of these two we get other Schur functions, because\nM (z) is not a multiple of the identity.\nR\n0.41\n\n0.4\n\n0.39\n-\u03a0\n\n0\n\n\u03a0\n\n\u0398\n\nFigure 5. \u03b8-dependence\nof the return probability R of a quantum\n\u221a\nwalk with \u03b3 = 1/ 2 (see (66)) of the initial state \u03c6 = (1, exp(i\u03b8)).\nIndeed, this can lead to different R.

Local perturbations. In the CGMV approach a local perturbation is easily\nimplemented by letting the Schur coefficients be constant only from some index\nonwards. From there on the fk are determined by the fixed point equation, and\nf = f0 is obtained by inverse Schur iteration (58).\nIn the Fourier approach a local perturbation can be turned into a perturbation\nonly at the origin, by redefining a block of cells as a single one. The resolvent\nof the perturbed unitary operator can be evaluated with the resolvent formula for\nperturbations. Since the \"unperturbed\" resolvent of the above operator U can\nbe computed separately for each U (p) this leads to a finite dimensional, albeit pdependent matrix computation. Of course, as in the CGMV case this may quickly\nlead to rather unwieldy expressions. However, at least for numerical work one gets\na systematic method.\n7. Outlook\n7.1. Examples with singular measures. Obviously, there is a wide range of\nexamples which one would like to treat under this heading. In the quantum walk\nfield, disordered walks, i.e., operators with space dependent i.i.d. random coins come\nto mind. In this case one has Anderson localization [3], i.e., dense point spectrum.\nIn almost periodic examples, such as walks in an irrational magnetic field, one\nexpects purely singular spectrum. For irrationals which are well approximated by\nrationals, e.g., Liouville numbers, there may be late returns grouped in a hierarchy\nof time scales. A further family of examples is given by measures with some selfsimilarity such as a famous example by Riesz [27, 30, 17].For the time being we have\nno general results about return times in these examples, but it seems to be a rich\nfield for investigations linking spectral properties with the dynamics of propagation,\nwhich we intend to explore further.\n7.2. Generalizations. We have focused completely on the case where absorption\nhappens only in one pure state, which is also the initial one. The main reason\nfor this was to have a very direct link to spectral theory, and a dependence only\non the pair (U, \u03c6) and nothing else. However, from the point of view of physical\napplications some generalizations are desirable, and can be pursued very much\nalong the lines set out in this paper. Indeed there is no reason why in Sect. 2.3\nthe initial and the absorbing state should be the same, so one can immediately\ngeneralize to \"first arrival\" rather than \"first return\". It is often natural to consider\na more than one dimensional space to be absorbing, e.g., when we want to discuss\nthe return of a coined walk to the origin, regardless of the internal state is. In\nthat case one might also want to look at spin resolved arrival events and, quite\ngenerally, at an array of counters. This has been studied in the continuous time\ncase [5, 36], which is a further generalization of interest. When an appropriate\nweakening of the absorption process is introduced to avoid the Zeno effect [11]\nin the continuous time limit one finds a picture analogous to the discrete time\ncase: The absorbing perturbation then modifies a one-parameter unitary group to\na semigroup of contractions. The difference of their generators, sometimes called\nan optical potential, may be unbounded or even fail to be a closable operator, as in\nthe case of an absorbing point \"potential\" \u2212i\u03bb\u03b4(x) perturbing the Laplacian (free\nparticle). The interplay between spectrum of the Hamiltonian and arrival time in\nthe continuous case contains a recently established uncertainty relation [20], but\nmuch is left to explore.\n\n\f26\n\nRECURRENCE FOR DISCRETE TIME UNITARY EVOLUTIONS\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful for the hospitality of Centro de Ciencias de Benasque Pedro\nPascual in Benasque (Spain), where our collaboration was initiated.
