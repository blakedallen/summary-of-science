The self-consistency of the procedure\nwith respect to the Kramers-Kronig transformation allows us to draw conclusions on the applicability\nof the spectral function analysis and on the existence of well defined quasiparticles along the nodal\ndirection even for the underdoped Bi-2212 in the pseudogap state.\nPACS numbers: 74.25.Jb, 74.72.Hs, 79.60.-i, 71.18.+y\n\nWith modern angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) [1, 2] one gets a direct snapshot of\nthe density of low energy electronic excited states in the\nmomentum-energy space of 2D solids [3, 4, 5, 6]. All\nthe interactions of the electrons which are responsible\nfor the unusual normal and superconducting properties\nof cuprates are encapsulated in such pictures, but are still\nhard to decipher. One way to take into account these\ninteractions is to consider electronic excitations as quasiparticles which, compared to the non-interacting electrons, are characterized by an additional complex selfenergy [7]. Extraction of the self-energy from experiment\nis thus of great importance to check the validity of the\nquasiparticle concept and understand the nature of interactions involved, but appears to be problematic since\nthe underlying band structure of the bare electrons is a\npriori unknown.\nOne can evaluate the interaction parameters taking the\nbare band dispersion from band structure calculations [4],\nhowever this unavoidably increases the uncertainty of any\nconclusions on the strength and nature of the interactions\ninvolved. A direct determination of the bare band structure from experiment would be much more attractive in\nthis sense. Previously, the bare band dispersion has been\nassigned to the high binding energy part of the experimental dispersion [8]. In Refs. 9, 10 we have discussed\nthat the bare Fermi velocity estimated from the nodal\nARPES spectra using the Kramers-Kronig (KK) transformation is in reasonable agreement with band structure calculations [11, 12] and with an analysis of the\nanisotropic plasmon dispersion [13], although it has been\npointed out that in order to quantify interaction parameters such as coupling strength [14] or self-energy [15] a\nprecise and reliable approach of bare band determination\nis needed.\n\navailable today, and, applying the procedure to the spectra from the underdoped Bi-2212, we demonstrate the\nvalidity of the quasiparticle concept even in the underdoped regime and in the pseudogap state. The detailed\ndescription of the procedure as well as its application to\nother samples of different doping level is given in Ref. 16.\nWe start with a brief overview of the basics of the\nnodal spectra analysis within the self-energy approach\nillustrated in Fig. 1. Measuring the photoemission intensity as a function of the kinetic energy and in-plane\nmomentum of outgoing electrons, I(Ek , k), one obtains\naccess to the spectral function of the one electron removal\nwhich is supposed to reflect the quasipartical properties\nof the remaining photohole: its effective mass and life\n\nIn this Letter we introduce an approach to directly extract the bare band dispersion and the self-energy functions from ARPES spectra. We show that the approach is\nself-consistent within the highest experimental accuracy\n\nFIG. 1: Bare band dispersion (solid line) and renormalized\ndispersion (red points) on top of the spectral weight of interacting electrons.

These properties can be expressed in terms of a\nquasiparticle self-energy \u03a3 = \u03a3\u2032 +i\u03a3\u2032\u2032 , an analytical function the real and imaginary parts of which are related by\nthe KK transform (the dispersion relation) [17]. Neglecting the effects of the energy and momentum resolutions\nas well as the influence of matrix elements [6], one can\ntake I \u221d A(\u03c9, k), where \u03c9 = Ek \u2212 h\u03bd + \u03c6 is the energy of\nthe electron in the crystal with respect to the Fermi level,\nh\u03bd is the excitation energy and \u03c6 is the work function.\nIn turn, the spectral function can be formulated in terms\nof the self-energy:\nA(\u03c9, k) = \u2212\n\n\u03a3\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9)\n1\n,\n\u03c0 (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03b5(k) \u2212 \u03a3\u2032 (\u03c9))2 + \u03a3\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9)2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b5(k) is the bare band dispersion.\nIn case there is no interaction, i.e. electronic excitations\ncan live forever, the spectral function is a delta function\nwith the pole \u03c9 \u2212 \u03b5(k\u03c9 ) = 0 and, e.g. for the nodal direction, can be represented by the solid line in Fig. 1.\nWhen interactions are present, the self-energy leads to a\nshifting and broadening of the non-interacting spectral\nfunction. The resulting picture is essentially that which\nis measured in ARPES (the blurred region in Fig. 1 illustrates this). If one neglects the momentum dependence\nof the self-energy, then, from Eq. (1), the momentum distribution curves (MDC(k) = A(k)\u03c9=const ) have maxima\nat km (\u03c9) determined by \u03c9 \u2212\u03b5(km )\u2212\u03a3\u2032 (\u03c9) = 0 for a given\n\u03c9. In other words, \u03a3\u2032 (\u03c9) = \u03c9 \u2212 \u03b5(km ), is that which is\nillustrated in Fig. 1 by the double headed arrow. In the\nregion where the bare dispersion can be considered as linear (\u03b5 = vF k), assuming weak k-dependence of \u03a3\u2032\u2032 along\na cut perpendicular to the Fermi surface [16], the MDCs\nexhibit a Lorentzian lineshape [5] with the half width at\nhalf maximum W and \u03a3\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) = \u2212vF W (\u03c9).\nThus, the determination of both the real and imaginary\nparts of the self-energy requires the knowledge of the bare\ndispersion (or, in the vicinity to EF , an \"energy scale\",\ne.g., vF [9]). The KK transformation gives an additional\nequation which relates these functions:\nZ \u221e \u2032\u2032\n\u03a3 (x)\n1\ndx,\n(2)\n\u03a3\u2032 (\u03c9) = P V\n\u03c0\n\u2212\u221e x \u2212 \u03c9\nwhere P V denotes the Cauchy principal value. This\nopens the way to extract all desired quantities from the\nexperiment.\nIn the vicinity of the Fermi level, one can determine the\ncoupling strength as \u03bb = \u2212(d\u03a3\u2032 (\u03c9)/d\u03c9)\u03c9=0 = vF /vR \u2212\n1, where vR = (dkm /d\u03c9)\u22121\n\u03c9=0 is the renormalized Fermi\nvelocity.

In cuprates, however, the MDC width W along\nthe nodal direction does not decrease or even saturate in\nthe whole experimentally accessible energy region (up to\n\u03c9m = 0.5 eV) and one can make only a rough estimation\n\u221e\nm\nexpanding DW = D\u03c9\n0 Wexp + D\u03c9m Wmod , where Wexp is\nthe experimentally determined function of \u03c9, and Wmod\nis a model function which depends on both the high energy cut-off, |\u03c9c | > |\u03c9m |, above which \u03a3\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) starts to\ndecrease or saturate and a model for these high energy\ntails. For a simple estimation one can take Wexp = \u03b1\u03c9 2\n2\n\u221e\nm\nwhich gives D\u03c9\nand Wmod = \u03b1\u03c9m\n0 Wexp = D\u03c9m Wmod ,\ndemonstrating that the contribution of unknown high energy tails can be essential.\nSince without the knowledge of Wmod (\u03c9) it is not possible to determine precisely the energy scale of the bare\nband or interactions from just the low binding energy\npart of ARPES spectra, in the following we examine a\nwider energy range of the ARPES data in order to solve\nthe problem. In this energy range a deviation of the bare\ndispersion from a line should be taken into account. In\nRef. 9 we have shown that the shape of the bare band\ncan be determined from the shape of the Fermi surface\nthrough the tight binding (TB) fitting procedure but the\nenergy scale must be determined independently.\nAlong the nodal direction the TB band in the occupied part can be well approximated by a simple parabola\n\u03b5(k) = \u03c90 (1 \u2212 k 2 /kF2 ), where the energy scale parameter\nis the bottom of the bare band, \u03c90 , or the bare Fermi\nvelocity, vF = \u22122\u03c90 /kF . Then, using this dispersion in\n(1), one can express the complex self-energy function in\nterms of two experimental functions km (\u03c9) and W (\u03c9):\nvF 2\n(k (\u03c9) \u2212 kF2 ) + \u03c9,\n2kF m\np\nvF\n2 (\u03c9) \u2212 W 2 (\u03c9).\n\u03a3\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) = \u2212 W (\u03c9) km\nkF\n\u03a3\u2032 (\u03c9) =\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\nThe KK transform \u03a3\u2032\u2032 \u2192 \u03a3\u2032 completes the system but\nadds new parameters which describe the high energy tails\nof \u03a3\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9).\nAs an example, we use the experimental data from an\nunderdoped Bi(Pb)-2212 (Tc = 77 K) measured along\nthe nodal direction at 130 K with 27 eV excitation energy, at which only the bonding band is visible [12]. The\nexperimental details can be found elsewhere [14, 15].\nFig. 2 shows the results of the procedure we describe.\nThe real part of the self-energy is determined in two ways:\n\n\f3\n\n0.20\n\n\u03a3\u2032, \u2212\u03a3\u2032\u2032 (eV)\n\n0.15\n\n0.10\n\n0.05\n\n0.00\n\n0.00\n\n-0.10\n\n-0.20\n\n-0.30\n\n\u03c9 (eV)\nFIG. 2: Real and imaginary parts of the self-energy extracted\nfrom the experiment with the described procedure. A complete coincidence between the corresponding parts of the selfenergy calculated from the two different experimental functions, the MDC dispersion and MDC width, demonstrates\nthe full self-consistency of the ARPES data treated within\nthe self-energy approach.\n\n(i) \u03a3\u2032disp , by Eq. (6) with vF as a parameter; (ii) by\nEq. (7) and subsequent KK transform of symmetrized\n\u03a3\u2032\u2032width \u2192 \u03a3\u2032KK with additional parameters which describe the \u03a3\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) tails, viz. a cut-off energy, \u03c9c , at which\nthe tail is attached and a model of its decay (see [16] for\ndetails). If the self-energy we are trying to extract satisfies the KK relation, \u03a3\u2032disp and \u03a3\u2032KK should be identical\nwithin experimental uncertainty which sets the space of\nthe parameters in question.\nIn the experimental energy range of 350 meV we have\nfound that vF is restricted by such a procedure in contrast to \u03c9c and to the model for the high energy tails, for\nwhich only a relation can be obtained. In practice, we\nchecked several models where \u03a3\u2032\u2032mod (\u03c9) saturates to some\nmaximum value, slowly decays or drops to zero above \u03c9c ,\nand for each model the fitting of \u03a3\u2032KK to \u03a3\u2032disp results in\nthe same vF (or \u03c90 ) but different \u03c9c (for details see Fig. 2\nin [16] and related discussion).\nAt this stage we have found that although the fitting\nprocedure is working well, i.e. the standard deviation has\na minimum as a function of (\u03c90 , \u03c9c ), and the resulting curves \u03a3\u2032disp and \u03a3\u2032KK almost coincide (not shown),\nthere are still deviations between them which exceed the\n\nexperimental error. These deviations can be expressed\nfor these two curves as a nondecreasing difference in the\nslope ratios below and above the 70 meV kink. To visualize this we fit the \u03a3\u2032 (\u03c9) functions in the range of |\u03c9| <\n170 meV to \u03a3\u2032low (\u03c9) = \u2212\u03bb\u03c9 \u2212\u2206\u03bb(\u03c9 \u2212\u03c9k ){arctan[\u03c9k /\u03b4]\u2212\narctan[(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9k )/\u03b4]}/\u03c0 (see Fig. 2), where \u03c9k \u2248 \u221270 meV\nis a kink energy and \u03b4 \u2248 30 meV is a kink width [19].\nFor \u03b4 \u226a |\u03c9k |, \u03bb and \u03bbh = \u03bb \u2212 \u2206\u03bb reflect the slopes below\n(|\u03c9| < |\u03c9k |) and above the kink energy respectively, and\nit is the difference in \u03bb/\u03bbh between \u03a3\u2032disp and \u03a3\u2032KK which\nis irreducible by varying the parameters \u03c90 , \u03c9c and the\nhigh energy tails.\nThe origin of this difference is related to resolution\nwhich mainly effects the low energy part of \u03a3\u2032KK (\u03c9)\nthrough W (\u03c9). Therefore, high energy slopes \u03bbh and\nhigh energy tails which are resolution independent should\ncoincide for \u03a3\u2032disp and \u03a3\u2032KK after the fitting procedure is performed. This appeared to be true and\nthe final result is shown in Fig. 2. It is remarkable\nthat the difference \u03a3\u2032KK \u2212 \u03a3\u2032disp completely coincides\nwith R\u2032 (\u03c9), the contribution from the overall resolution R = p\n15 meV, calculated as R\u2032 = KK R\u2032\u2032 , where\n\u2032\u2032\nR (\u03c9) = R2 + [\u03a3\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) \u2212 \u03a3\u2032\u2032 (0)]2 \u2212 [\u03a3\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) \u2212 \u03a3\u2032\u2032 (0)] is\nthe contribution of the overall resolution to the scattering rate. Such a complete coincidence substantiates that\nthe self-energy constructed using Eqs. (6) and (7) is selfconsistent within the experimental accuracy currently\navailable with ARPES. In order to check the correctness\nof the KK numerics, we also plot \u03a3\u2032\u2032KK (\u03c9) function which\nis obtained by back KK-transform of \u03a3\u2032KK (\u03c9).\nFor underdoped Bi(Pb)-2212, for which kF = 0.471\n\n4\n\n0.0\n3\n\n-0.2\n\n\u03c9 (eV)\n\n\u03a3\u2032disp\n\u03a3\u2032KK\n\u03a3\u2032disp kink fit\n\u03a3\u2032KK kink fit\nresolution effect\n\u03a3\u2032KK \u2212 \u03a3\u2032disp\n\u03a3\u2032\u2032width\n\u03a3\u2032\u2032KK\n\n2\n1\n\n-0.4\n\n0\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.8\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n-1\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nk (\u00c5 )\nFIG. 3: The bare band dispersion along the nodal direction\nof an underdoped Bi(Pb)-2212 (black solid line) on top of\nits spectral weight at 130 K measured by ARPES. MDC (or\nrenormalized) dispersion shown by solid red line.\n\n\f4\n\u00c5\u22121 and vR = 2.04 \u00b1 0.05 eV\u00c5, we have obtained for\nthe bare band dispersion along the nodal direction vF =\n3.82 \u00b1 0.17 eV\u00c5 (\u03c90 = \u22120.90 \u00b1 0.04 eV). This bare band\nis shown in Fig. 3 on top of the electron spectral weight\nas measured by ARPES. The interaction parameters thus\nare the following: \u03bb = 0.87 \u00b1 0.12 and \u03bbh = 0.24 \u00b1 0.03.\nAs we discussed above, the energy cut-off, \u03c9c , depends\non the model used for the high energy tails of \u03a3\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) but\nwe can state that |\u03c9c | \u2248 |\u03c90 |/2.\nThe linear behavior of \u03a3\u2032 (\u03c9) over a wide energy range |\u03c9| < |\u03c9k | indicates, using the criterion\nlim\u03c9\u21920 \u03a3\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9)/\u03c9 = 0, the existence of well defined quasiparticles in the pseudogap state: for the underdoped\nBi(Pb)-2212 at 130 K the coherence factor Z = 0.54 \u00b1\n0.03. The offset of \u03a3\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) not only comes from finite\nresolution but also finite temperature and scattering on\nimpurities, which are mostly energy independent [15] and\ndo not contribute to the slope of \u03a3\u2032 (\u03c9) and, therefore, to\nthe coherence factor.\nIn [10] we have noticed that the scattering rate at room\ntemperature looks more linear for underdoped samples\nthan for overdoped ones that is in favour of the marginal\nFermi liquid model (MFL) [20]. It is important to stress\nthat \u03a3\u2032 (\u03c9) determined with better accuracy exhibits a\nlinear behavior below and above the kink energy \u03c9k (see\nFig. 2) which is now difficult to reconcile with the MFL\nmodel: as far as a slope in \u03a3\u2032 (\u03c9), according to Eq. (3), is\nmainly determined by the coefficient at (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9x )2 term\nin the expansion of \u03a3\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) around \u03c9x , the straight sections on \u03a3\u2032 (\u03c9) imply the regions where \u03a3\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) is precisely\nparabolic (exhibits constant curvature over some finite\nenergy regions).\nAnother point arises as a consequence of the tight correlation between \u03a3\u2032 and \u03a3\u2032\u2032 . Recently we have shown [15]\nthat two different channels can be distinguished in the\nscattering rate: the doping independent Auger like decay which originates from the electron-electron Coulomb\ninteraction and the doping dependent one which can be\nnaturally assosiated with spin excitations. While such\na decomposition of the scattering rate into two channels\nseems to be becoming commonly accepted [21], there is\nstill a controversy about the origin of the doping dependent one. The present analysis shows that regardless of\nthe nature of this channel, its doping and temperature dependence should appear in the doping and temperature\ndependence of \u03a3\u2032 and, consequently, of the renormalized\ndispersion, although it is clear that the variations in the\nlatter should be marginal. This casts doubt on the apparent universality of the nodal Fermi velocity [22], viz.\nthat under close scrutiny it will not hold.\nIn conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time the\n\nfull self-consistency of the data obtained using angle resolved photoemission and treated within the self-energy\napproach. This self-consistency is demonstrated on an\nunderdoped Bi-2212 sample (Tc = 77 K) in the pseudogap state. The extracted bare band dispersion is in\ngood agreement with the band structure calculations\nand allows one to quantify the self-energy of the electronic excitations in the real energy scale. The accurately determined real and imaginary parts of the selfenergy prove the existence of well defined quasiparticles\nalong the nodal direction even in the pseudogap state of\nBi-2212.\nThe project is part of the Forschergruppe FOR538 and\nis supported by the DFG under grants number KN393/4\nand 436UKR17/10/04 and by the Swiss National Science Foundation and its NCCR Network \"Materials with\nNovel Electronic Properties\".\n\n[1] A.
