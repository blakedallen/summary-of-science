This improvement of the effective\npotential function is seen to reduce residual dependence on the renormalization mass scale. The allorders summation of leading logarithm terms involving the dominant three couplings contributing\nto radiative corrections is suggestive of a potential characterized by a plausible Higgs boson mass\nof 216 GeV. However, the tree potential's local minimum at \u03c6 = 0 is restored if QCD is sufficiently\nstrong.\n\nOver thirty years ago, S. Coleman and E. Weinberg [1] demonstrated how spontaneous symmetry breaking may\noccur through radiative corrections to a conformally-invariant Lagrangian in which no quadratic mass term appears.\nSuch symmetry breaking, in which the scalar-field vacuum expectation value h\u03c6i is the only source of scale, is of\nparticular relevance for the spontaneous breakdown of SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) electroweak symmetry, which necessarily requires\na mechanism within any embedding theory to keep any such quadratic mass term minimally contaminated by the\nunification mass scale- the absence of such a mass term implies that this mechanism is exact [2]. We emphasize that\nsuch a mechanism, whether exact or nearly so, is a necessary component of the Standard Model, though the nature\nof this mechanism (possibly conformal invariance) remains unknown. In the absence of an explicit scalar-field mass\nterm (i.e. the \"exact mechanism\"), the one-loop (1L) effective potential for SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) gauge theory is given by\n[1]\n\u0013\n\u0014\n\u0015\u0012\n2\n2\n3(3g24 + 2g22 g \u2032 2 + g \u2032 4 )\n25\n\u03c62\n\u03bb\u03c64\n(1L)\n4 12\u03bb \u2212 3gt\n+\u03c6\n+\n.\n(1)\nlog 2 \u2212\nVef f =\n4\n64\u03c0 2\n1024\u03c0 2\n\u03bc\n6\nThere are four distinct coupling constants appearing in Eq. (1), the SU (2) coupling constant g2 , the U (1) coupling\nconstant g \u2032 , the t-quark Yukawa coupling constant gt , and the quartic scalar-field self-interaction coupling constant\n\u03bb. The radiative symmetry breaking scenario of Ref. [1], which preceded the discovery of the massive top quark, led\nto a value for \u03bb proportional to g24 and a scalar field mass of order 10 GeV. The presence of a large Yukawa couplant\n[gt2 \u2243 1.0 >> g22 , g \u2032 2 ] spoils this scenario; the O(gt2 ) value of \u03bb required for radiative symmetry breaking would be so\nlarge that subsequent leading logarithm terms [e.g. \u03bb3 \u03c64 log2 (\u03c62 /\u03bc2 )] would be too large to neglect.\nIn the present work, we explicitly sum all such leading logarithm terms within the full perturbative series for the\neffective potential [3] to examine the viability of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking. We find the potential is\nminimized for a Higgs mass of 216 GeV, and observe some evidence that this value may be stable after including\ncontributions from subsequent-to-leading logarithms.\nIf we denote the dominant Standard Model couplants as x \u2261 gt2 /4\u03c0 2 , y \u2261 \u03bb/4\u03c0 2 , and z \u2261 g32 /4\u03c0 2 [QCD contributes\nto leading logarithms past one-loop order], which are much larger P\nthan corresponding couplants for g2 , g \u2032 and non2 4\nt-quark Yukawa couplings, this series is of the form Vef f = \u03c0 \u03c6\nCn,k,l,p xn y k z l Lp , where L(\u03bc) \u2261 log[\u03c62 (\u03bc)/\u03bc2 ].\nThe leading logarithms in this series are those terms one degree lower in the power of the logarithm L than in the\naggregate power of the couplants {x, y, z},\n(\u221e\n)\n\u221e\n\u221e\nX X\nX\n2 4\n2 4\nn\nk\nl\nn+k+l\u22121\nVLL = \u03c0 \u03c6 SLL = \u03c0 \u03c6\nx\ny\nz Cn,k,l L\n, (C0,0,0 = 0).\n(2)\nn=0\n\nk=0\n\nl=0\n\nThe series SLL is determined entirely by one-loop contributions to the renormalization-group (RG) equation, i.e., by\nthose contributions that either lower the power of L by one or raise the aggregate power of the couplants by one [2, 4]:\n\u0014\n\n\u2202\n+\n\u22122\n\u2202L\n\n\u0012\n\n9 2\nx \u2212 4xz\n4\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0015\n7 2 \u2202\n3 2 \u2202\n\u2202\n2\n+ 6y + 3yx \u2212 x\n\u2212 z\n\u2212 3x SLL (x, y, z, L) = 0.\n\u2202x\n2\n\u2202y 2 \u2202z\n\n(3)\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\ndx\n\u2202\n, \u2202y\n, \u2202z\nare respectively the one-loop beta-functions for x, y, z (where \u03b2x = \u03bc d\u03bc\n); the\nIn eq.

For example, the leading coefficients\n\n\f2\nC0,1,0 = 1, C1,0,0 = C0,0,1 = 0, follow from the \u03bb\u03c64 /4 tree-order potential. Upon substitution of Eq. (2) into Eq.

Consequently, Eqs. (8)\u2013(11) are sufficient to determine the entire leading logarithm contribution to the scalar field mass to all (contributing) orders in {x, y, z}. These equations are also obtainable via the\nmethod-of-characteristics methodology of Bando et al [5], which has been implemented in conventional (non-radiative)\n(4)\n\u2032\n2\nStandard Model symmetry breaking by Quiros and collaborators [6]. The conditions Vef\nf (v) = 0 and Vef f (v) = 24\u03c0 y\n35\n25\nrespectively imply that y = \u2212B/2 \u2212 K and K = \u2212[ 6 B + 3 C + 20D + 16E]. Given the phenomenological Standard\nModel values for the vacuum expectation value v = 246 GeV , the t-quark Yukawa couplant x(v) = 1/4\u03c0 2 , the QCD\ncouplant z(v) = \u03b1s (v)/\u03c0 = 0.0329, as evolved from \u03b1s (Mz ) = 0.120 [7], we find these constraints taken together\nconstitute a degree-5 equation for the scalar-field self-interaction couplant y. The only real positive-y solution that\nyields a positive second derivative (hence, a local minimum) is y = 0.0538. Once y is determined, then B, C, D and\nE are also numerically determined. To present order, we can approximate the Higgs field propagator pole with the\n\u2032\u2032\n2 2\n2\nsecond derivative of the effective potential at \u03c6 = v. One then finds m2\u03c6 \u223c\n= Vef\nf (v) = 8\u03c0 v (B + C) = (216 GeV) .\n\n\f3\nIn assessing the viability of this result, it is of interest to consider what one would similarly obtain from the one-loop\neffective potential augmented by a \u03c0 2 \u03c64 K counterterm. Such a potential is seen to correspond to Eq. (7) with B as\ngiven by Eq. (8), but with C = D = E = 0. The conditions V \u2032 (v) = 0, V (4) (v) = 24\u03c0 2 y are then seen to lead to a\nsolution y = 0.093, m\u03c6 = 350 GeV. Such a mass is well outside the O(200 GeV) bound on m\u03c6 from corrections to\nelectroweak theory [7]. Moreover, it is easy to demonstrate that this value for y is too large to be meaningful. The\ncontributions of y alone to the \u03b2-function for its own evolution correspond to the \u03b2-function of an O(4) symmetric\nscalar field theory, which is known to five-loop order [8]:\nlim \u03bc\nx\u21920\n\nz\u21920\n\n39\ndy\n= 6y 2 \u2212 y 3 + 187.85y 4 \u2212 2698.3y 5 + 47975y 6 + ...\nd\u03bc\n2\n\n(12)\n\nIf y = 0.093, terms of this series increase after the second term, indicative of a failure to converge. By contrast,\nterms of the series (12) decrease if y = 0.0538. Similar results characterize this same scalar field theory's anomalous\ndimension, whose terms decrease monotonically when y = 0.0538, but fail to do so when y = 0.093. Of course it is of\ngreater interest to estimate possible corrections to our result to 2-loop order. For our parameter values x = 0.0253,\ny = 0.0538, z = 0.0329, the two loop contributions to the Standard Model beta functions and anomalous scalarfield dimension provide corrections no larger than 17% of their one-loop counterparts. This provides us with further\nconfidence that the 216 GeV Higgs mass prediction will be stable upon summation of subsequent next-to-leading\nlogarithms.\nIn Figure 1 we compare the residual scale- (\u03bc-) dependence of Vef f (\u03c6) = \u03c0 2 \u03c64 (SLL + K) obtained via Eqs. (8)\u2013(11)\nto that of the one-loop effective potential discussed in the preceding paragraph. Such dependence in both potentials\noccurs explicitly through L(\u03bc) and implicitly through couplants whose one-loop evolution in \u03bc is anchored to the\n\u03bc = v initial values given above (e.g. x(v) = 1/4\u03c0 2 ). The K\u03c64 counterterms in both potentials are each assumed\nto be RG-invariant (K(v)\u03c64 (v)), since the subleading logarithm contributions ultimately devolving from such terms\nare uncontrolled by Eq. (3). For \u03bc = {v/2, v, 2v}, the curves exhibit the dependence of the potentials on the RGinvariant initial value \u03c6(v) for the evolution of \u03c6(\u03bc) [(\u03bc/\u03c6)d\u03c6/d\u03bc = \u22123x(\u03bc)/4]. Figure 1 shows that summation\nof leading logarithms substantially reduces the residual scale dependence of the effective potential. Moreover, if we\nassume such scale dependence to be indicative of next-order corrections, we can expect only modest departures from\nthe m\u03c6 = 216 GeV prediction at \u03bc = v: m\u03c6 varies from 208 GeV at \u03bc = v/2 to 217 GeV at \u03bc = 2v. We find\nsuch uncertainties in m\u03c6 to dominate over much smaller ones deriving from (Standard-Model) uncertainties in the\ncouplant values x(v) and z(v). We have also verified by numerical calculation of the RG equations that the methodof-characteristics methodology of Bando et al [5, 6] yields the same results for the effective potential and the Higgs\nmass to within a value of 0.2%.\nNote also that the scalar field mass of order 216 GeV we obtain from the aggregate contribution of leading logarithms to the purely-radiative breakdown of SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) electroweak symmetry is accompanied by a scalar-field\ninteraction couplant y = 0.0538 substantially larger than that anticipated from conventional spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking (deriving from a potential with an initially-negative quadratic term), in which a 216 GeV Higgs particle\nwould necessarily correspond to a value y = \u03bb/4\u03c0 2 = m2\u03c6 /(8\u03c0 2 h\u03c6i2 = 0.0097. If electroweak symmetry-breaking is\npurely radiative, then y-sensitive processes such as the W + W \u2212 \u2192 ZZ scattering cross-section [9] will necessarily be\nlarger than anticipated from conventional spontaneous symmetry breaking. Consequently, if an O(200 GeV) Higgs\nwere discovered, a clear signal of radiative symmetry breaking would be a corresponding order-of-magnitude-or-more\nenhancement of \u03c3 (W + W \u2212 \u2192 ZZ) over the value expected from such a Higgs mass.\nOne of the motivations for summing leading logarithms is to ascertain the negative large-logarithm behaviour of\nthe effective potential, behaviour corresponding to the zero-field limit of the potential. We do not consider positive\nlarge-logarithm behaviour because of the intervening Landau singularity at w = 0 [Eqs. (4) and (5)], corresponding to\n\u03c6(v) \u2248 22v [10]. When |L| is very large, we find that yF0 \u2192 \u22121/3L, xF1 \u2192 2(x/z)/L, and x2 LF2 \u2192 \u22123(x2 /z 2 )/2L.\nThe large-|L| behaviour of subsequent terms in the series (4) can be extracted by noting that the first term on the\nPp+1\nRHS of Eq. (6) dominates\nthe\n\u0001 second\n\u0003 term when the magnitude of \u03b6(= zL) is large, and that Fp (w, \u03b6) \u223c k=0 fp,k (\u03b6)\n\u0002 w\u22121\n\u223c 1 . One then finds after a little algebra that when |\u03b6| is large,\nin this large-|L| limit\nw\n\u0014\n\u0015\nd\n9p \u2212 21\n2\n(7\u03b6 /2) + 4p\u03b6 Fp =\nFp\u22121 , p \u2265 3.\n(13)\nd\u03b6\n4\nP3\n\u22122\nIn the large |\u03b6| limit, we find that F2 \u223c\n. Eq. (13) implies that Fp \u223c fp \u03b6 \u2212p , where\nk=0 f2,k (\u03b6) \u223c (\u22123/2)\u03b6\nthe numerical factors\u0001 fp follow from f2 = \u22123/2 via the recursion relation fp = (9p \u2212 21)fp\u22121 /2p. Note that\np\nxp Lp\u22121 Fp (w, \u03b6) \u223c xz fp /L in the large-|L| limit; each term in the series (4) is inversely proportional to L when\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 1: Residual scale dependence of the standard model effective potential with (upper three curves) and without (lower three\ncurves) summation of leading logarithms, as discussed in the text. For the resummed curves, the solid line represents \u03bc = v,\nthe dashed line represents \u03bc = v/2, and the dotted line represents \u03bc = 2v. For the unsummed curves, the dashed-double-dotted\ncurve represents \u03bc = v, the dashed-single-dotted curve represents \u03bc = v/2, and the dashed curve is for \u03bc = 2v.\n\n|L| is large. Moreover, if (x/z) < 2/9, the above recursion relation for fp can be utilized to obtain the closed-form\n\u0001\n\u00014/3\n1\nseries summation SLL \u223c \u2212 3L\n1 \u2212 9x\n. For sufficiently strong QCD, this result implies that a Standard Model\n2z\neffective potential based upon a massless tree potential exhibits a local minimum, rather than a maximum, at \u03c6 = 0\n(i.e. L \u2192 \u2212\u221e). Such a conclusion, however, does not follow if x/z is outside its radius of convergence (i.e. if\nx/z > 2/9), as is the case for the empirical standard model [x(v) \u2243 1/4\u03c0 2 , z(v) = \u03b1s (v)/\u03c0 \u2243 0.033].\nRecent work [11] based upon Pad\u00e9 approximants constructed from the QCD \u03b2-function series suggests for up\nto five light flavours that the QCD couplant may exhibit the same double-valued behaviour known to characterize\nN = 1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory, in which coexisting strong-couplant and (asymptotically-free)\nweak-couplant phases evolve toward a common infrared attractive point [12]. If the strong phase is sufficiently strong\n(x/z < 2/9), one can envision a scenario in which the \u03c6 = 0 local minimum of preserved SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) symmetry\nis upheld by the strong phase of QCD, but is transformed into a symmetry breaking minimum at \u03c6 = v if QCD is\nin its weak phase. Since for the latter case the minimum at \u03c6 = v (V (v) < 0) is deeper than the \u03c6 = 0 (V (0) = 0)\nminimum occurring when QCD is in its strong phase, the weak phase of QCD is seen to be the preferred one. Thus,\nif QCD is characterized by two coexisting phases, as is the case for SYM [12], the asymptotic freedom of QCD may\nbe linked to the radiative breakdown of electroweak symmetry.\nWe are grateful to V.A.
