In the present paper these formulas are\nused in order to get explicit relations between eigenvalues of p-Hecke operators\n(generators of the p-Hecke algebra of X) on cohomology spaces of some of these\nsubmotives, for the case X is a Siegel variety. Hence, this result is conjectural as\nwell: methods related to counting points on reductions of X using the Selberg trace\nformula are not used.\nIt turns out that the above relations are linear, their coefficients are polynomials\nin p which satisfy a simple recurrence formula. The same result can be easily\nobtained for any Shimura variety.\nThis result is an intermediate step for a generalization of the Kolyvagin's theorem\nof finiteness of Tate \u2013 Shafarevich group of elliptic curves of analytic rank 0 , 1\nover Q, to the case of submotives of other Shimura varieties, particularly of Siegel\nvarieties of genus 3.\nIdea of the proof: from one side, the above formulas of Langlands - Arthur give\nus (conjectural) relations between Weil numbers of a submotive. From another side,\nthe Satake map permits us to transform these relations between Weil numbers into\nrelations between eigenvalues of p-Hecke operators on X.\nThe paper contains also a survey of some related questions, for example explicit\nfinding of the Hecke polynomial for X, and (Appendix) tables for the cases g = 2, 3.\nKey words: Siegel varieties, submotives, Hecke correspondences, Weil numbers,\nSatake map\nAMS Subject classification: 14G35, 11G18\nVersion of Feb. 19, 2002\n\n\fIntroduction.\nThe purpose of the present paper is to show that starting from some standard\nconjectures of Langlands - Arthur, a chain of elementary calculations leads to a\nsimply-formulated and non-expected result on relations between eigenvalues of pHecke operators on a Shimura variety (which hence depends on these conjectures).\nNamely, let \u03a0 be a stable global packet of automorphic representations of a\nreductive group G (G corresponds to a Shimura variety X). Attached to \u03a0 is a\nparabolic subgroup P of G. Let M be an irreducible constituent of a submotive\nconjecturally attached to \u03a0 (see (0.1) below). We denote by E the field of coefficients of M. H i (M) is a module over the p-Hecke algebra H(G) = Hp (G) of X,\np is a fixed prime. Any t \u2208 H(G) acts on H i (M) by multiplication by an element\nmM (t) of E. If {ti } is a set of generators of H(G) then numbers mM (ti ) can satisfy\nsome relations.\nThe main result of the present paper is the Theorem 4.4. We fix the type\nof a Shimura variety (the level is arbitrary) and a parabolic subgroup P . We\nfind the set of relations between mM (ti ) (depending on P only) such that if the\nabove conjectures are true then these relations are satisfied for all submotives M\ncorresponding to all stable \u03a0 corresponding to P .\nReally, the first steps of the calculations of the present paper are made only for\nSiegel varieties, and the last step only for submotives corresponding to one type\nof P (the simplest no-trivial). This restriction is not of principle: a reader can\neasily get analogous results for any Shimura variety and any type of submotives,\nincluding the ones that correspond to non-stable packets. The author is interested\nin the case g = 3, because the main result of the present paper can be applied\nfor a generalization of the Kolyvagin's theorem to the case of submotives of Siegel\nvarieties of genus 3.\nThe paper contains also some calculations that are not logically necessary for\nthe proof of the main theorem, but can be used for references or for the further\ndevelopment of the subject (Sections 2.2 - 2.4, 3.4 and small parts of other sections).\nSome tables for genii 2 and 3 are given in the Appendix, which is written by the\nsame reason.\nAcknowledgments. The author is grateful to A. Andrianov and M. Borovoi\nfor important advice on the subject of this paper.\n0. Idea of the proof.\nRecall that in order to define a Shimura variety X of a fixed level, we must fix a\nreductive group G over Q, a map h : Res C/R (Gm ) \u2192 G over R, and a level subgroup\nK \u2282 G(Af (Q)); these data must satisfy some conditions ([D]). Throughout the\npaper we consider only the case when p does not divide the level, i.e. K \u2283 G(Zp ).\nWe shall consider only the case of Siegel varieties, i.e. from here we let G = GSp2g\nover Q. Further, we must choose a compactification of X and a type of cohomology.\nReally, all subsequent considerations depend only on G and h and hence does\nnot depend on level, compactification and the type of cohomology.\nWe fix a Borel subgroup B of G and consider all intermediate parabolic subgroups\nP of G, B \u2282 P \u2282 G. There is a 1 - 1 correspondence between the set of archimedean\ncohomological A-parameters of G and the set of such P ([AJ]; [A]; [BR], Section 4.1).\nWe denote by \u03a0P the packet of automorphic representations of G(R) corresponding\n2\n\n\fto the archimedean cohomological A-parameter corresponding to P ([BR], Section\n4.2).\nAttached to P and X is a set (indexed by k) of stable global packets of automorphic representations of G(AQ ). This set clearly depends on the level of X.\nglob\nWe denote the k-th packet by \u03a0glob\nP (k). Let \u03c0 \u2208 \u03a0P (k) be a representation,\n\u03c0 = \u03c0\u221e \u2297 \u03c0f its decomposition on archimedean and finite part, and \u03c0f = \u2297l \u03c0l\n(l = prime) the decomposition of \u03c0f . We consider only such \u03c0 for which \u03c0p is\nnon-ramified (see Step 3 below for a description of \u03c0p ). We have \u03c0\u221e \u2208 \u03a0P , and for\ndef \u2032\n\u2032\nany other \u03c0\u221e\n\u2208 \u03a0P the representation \u03c0 \u2032 = \u03c0\u221e\n\u2297 \u03c0f also belongs to \u03a0glob\nP (k).\nConjecturally, \u2200k there exists a submotive MP (k) (reducible unless P = B) such\nthat\nLp (\u03c0, r, s) = Lp (MP (k), s)\n(0.1)\nwhere r :L G \u2192 GL(W ) is a finite-dimensional representation defined in [BR], 5.1;\nWeil numbers of MP (k) and hence its L-function are considered with respect to E,\nand Lp (\u03c0, r, s) = L(\u03c0p , r, s) is the local L-function (particularly, it does not change\nif we change \u03c0 by \u03c0 \u2032 ).\nFrom now we fix some k and we denote MP (k) simply by MP . It is the main\nobject of the present paper. Since it is conjectural, all subsequent theorems should\nbe understand as follows:\nLet MP be a motive such that (0.1) is satisfied. Then ... (statement of the\ntheorem).\nSome references for properties of MP : [BR], Sections 4.3, 5, 7; [A], Section\n9, and the present paper, section 3. Most of these properties are not necessary\nfor\nproof of the main theorem. Here we mention only that (0.1) implies that\nP the\ni\ng\ni h (MP ) = dim r; for G = GSp2g this number is 2 . See also Remark 0.1 below.\n\nNow let M \u2282 MP , mM , E be as in the Introduction. Multiplication by elements\nof E gives us an inclusion iM : E \u2192 C. It is clear that the composite map\niM \u25e6 mM : H(G) \u2192 C does not depend on M but only on MP . So, we denote the\nmap iM \u25e6 mM by m = mP . The main result of the present paper is the finding of\nrelations between numbers m(ti ).\n\nStep 1. We use the following notation: if b1 , . . . , bg Q\nis a set of numbers and I\nis a subset of the set {1, . . . , g} then we denote bI = i\u2208I bi . In (2.7) we recall\na (well-known; see, for example, [BR], Sect. 5.1, Example 3) proof of a fact that\nthere exists a set of numbers a0 , b1 , b2 , . . . , bg \u2208 C such that eigenvalues of r(\u03b8\u03c0p )\n(where \u03b8\u03c0p is a Langlands element of \u03c0p ) have the form a0 bI where I runs over the\nset of all 2g subsets of (1, . . . , g). Hence, (0.1) means that the Weil numbers of MP\nhave the same form.\nStep 2. We shall show in Sect. 4 (as a result of calculations of Sect. 3) that\nfor a fixed P numbers a0 , b1 , b2 , . . . , bg satisfy some relations depending only on P\n(Prop. 4.3).\nStep 3. Finally, using explicit formulas of Satake map (Sect. 2), we shall show\nthat relations of Prop. 4.3 give us relations between numbers m(ti ).\nNow we describe steps 2 and 3 in more details.\n3\n\n\fStep 2a. Firstly, we recall the description of the set of parabolic subgroups\nP under consideration: there are 2 types of such subgroups, and subgroups of\neach type are parametrized by the set of ordered partitions of g, i.e. the set of\nrepresentations of g as a sum\ng = b1 + b2 + * * * + bk\n\n(0.2)\n\n(bi \u2265 1, the order is essential), or, the same, the set of sequences\n0 = m1 < m2 < * * * < mk+1 = g\nwhere mi = b1 + * * * bi\u22121 .\nStep 2b. Using formulas of [BR], Sect. 4, we describe explicitly in Sect. 3.3 the\nset of archimedean cohomological representations belonging to \u03a0P . Namely, let P\nbe of type 1 given by (0.2). We denote by C the set of sequences c = (c1 , . . . , ck )\nsuch that \u2200j = 1, . . . , k 0 \u2264 cj \u2264 bj . We have: \u03a0P is isomorphic to C factorized by\nthe equivalence relation (c1 , . . . , ck ) \u223c (b1 \u2212 c1 , . . . , bk \u2212 ck ). For P of type 2 the\nresult is the same, but c1 is omitted. The representation corresponding to c \u2208 C is\ndenoted by \u03c0c .\nStep 2c. Now we use formulas of [BR], Sect. 4 for the dimensions of\nH i,j (g, Kc ; \u03c0c ), g = gsp2g . We consider for all i = 1, . . . , k the set S(ci , bi ) of\nall subsets of order ci of the set {1, . . . , bi }, and we denote\nS(c, P ) =\n\nk\nY\n\ni=1\n\nS(ci , bi ) or S(c, P ) = (Z/2Z)\n\nb1\n\nk\nY\n\nS(ci , bi )\n\n(0.3)\n\ni=2\n\nfor P of type 1 and 2 respectively (this is the set of representatives of minimal\nlength for the cosets \u03a9(T, M/\u03a9(T, M \u2229 wKw\u22121 ) in notations of [BR], Sect. 4.3).\nFor \u03c1 \u2208 S(c, P ) an explicit formula for the length l(\u03c1) is given in (3.5.1).\nFurther, (3.5.1) give us relations between Weil numbers of MP . The exact\nformula for these relations is given in (4.1). Really, (4.1) is a corollary of a stronger\nproposition 4.3.\n**********************************************************\nThe following Remark 0.1 is not a part of the text of the paper. It is included\nin order\n(1) To help to a reader to understand the notations;\n(2) It contains some questions which I cannot answer, for example: (a) is condition (0.1.2) sufficient? (b) Let us consider a decomposition of the right hand side\nof (0.1.4) coming from the theorem on structure of finite-dimensional sl2 -modules.\nDoes this decomposition come from a decomposition of MP,i itself?\nI would be very grateful to a reader for answers.\nSince the contents of the Remark 0.1 are not used in the present paper, possible\nerrors have not influence on the proof of the main theorem.\nRemark 0.1. A sketch of the description of the structure of MP ([A], [BR]).\nL\nThe space generated by S(c, P ) is isomorphic to i,j H i,j (g, Kc ; \u03c0c ), so it is a\nsl2 -module with a Hodge structure. We denote this sl2 -module by Lie(S(c, P )).\n4\n\n\fThere are 2 numbers pc , qc associated to each c (see [BR], Section 4.3 for a formula\nfor them, and (3.4) for explicit values). 2 basis elements of minimal weight in\nS(c, P ) have Hodge numbers hpc ,qc = hqc ,pc = 1 (case G = GSp, pc 6= qc ; formulas\nfor other Hodge numbers are given for example in [A], Section 9).\nThere exists a partition of C:\nC=\n\n[\n\nCi\n\n(0.1.1)\n\ni\u2208I\n\n(the union is disjoint) which gives rise to a descomposition of MP as a direct sum\nof submotives. For c1 , c2 a necessary condition to belong to one Ci is the following:\n(0.1.2) For j = 1, 2 numbers pcj + qcj coincide and sl2 -modules Lie(S(cj , P ))\n(but not their Hodge structures!) are isomorphic.\nAttached to (0.1.1) is a motive decomposition\nMP =\n\nM\ni\u2208I\n\nMP,i\n\n(0.1.3)\n\nhaving the following property: H \u2217 (MP,i ) has a natural structure of sl2 -module,\nand we have an isomorphism of sl2 -modules with Hodge structures:\nH \u2217 (MP,i ) =\n\nM\n\nLie(S(c, P ))\n\n(0.1.4)\n\nc\u2208Ci\n\nand analogously for their components of any fixed weight. It is known that a\ndescomposition of MP,i in a direct sum indexed by c \u2208 Ci - like in (0.1.4) - does\nnot exist. Clearly (0.1.3), (0.1.4) give us a description of Hodge numbers of MP\nand primitive elements in its cohomology groups.\nSee also Appendix, 8 for some explicit properties of MP , where P is of two\nsimplest types.\n**********************************************************\nStep 2d. To complete Step 2, we must use results of steps 1 and 2c in order to\nfind relations between numbers a0 , b1 , b2 , . . . , bg . These relations are the following\n(Proposition 4.3):\n(0.4) P of the first type: bmi +1 are free variables,\nbmi +c = pc\u22121 bmi +1 (c =\nQ\n2\ng(g+1)/2\n1, . . . , bi ), and a0 is defined by the equality a0 bi = p\n.\nP of the second type: bi = pi for i = 1, . . . , b1 , bmi +1 (2 \u2264 i \u2264 k) are free\nvariables, bmi +c and a0 are like above.\nStep 3. The p-Hecke algebra H(G) is the ring of polynomials whose generators\nare denoted by \u03c4p,\u2217 , \u2217 = \u2205, 1, . . . , g: H(G) = Z[\u03c4p , \u03c4p,1 , . . . , \u03c4p,g ]. Let \u03c7 : T (Qp ) \u2192\nC\u2217 be a nonramified character such that \u03c0\u03c7 = \u03c0p where \u03c0p is the p-part of \u03c0\nand \u03c0\u03c7 : G(Qp ) \u2192 GL(V) is the parabolically induced representation. \u03c7 does\nnot depend on \u03c0 \u2208 \u03a0glob\nP (k). \u03c0\u03c7 defines an action of H(G) on a 1-dimensional\nG(Zp )\nsubspace of V\nand hence a homomorphism \u03b1G (\u03c7) : H(G) \u2192 C. Obviously\n\u03b1G (\u03c7) = m, hence in order to find relations between numbers m(\u03c4p,\u2217 ) we need to\nrepresent \u03b1G (\u03c7)(\u03c4p,\u2217 ) as polynomials in a0 , b1 , b2 , . . . , bg and to use (0.4).\n5\n\n\fTo solve this problem we use\ni\n\n(a) the Satake map S : H(G) \u2192 H(T ) where H(T ) \u0592\u2192 Z[Ui\u00b11 , Vi\u00b11 ] is the Hecke\nalgebra of a maximal torus T of G;\n(b) an explicit expression for a Langlands element \u03b8(\u03c0\u03c7 ) \u2208 T\u0302 \u2282 L G given in\n(2.7.1), and a decomposition of r|T\u0302 as a sum of characters of T\u0302 (Section 2.6).\nExplicit formulas for S(\u03c4p,\u2217 ) are given in Section 1 ((1.2.1), (1.3.1), (1.5.1)).\nFurther, there exists a map \u03b1T (\u03c7) : Z[Ui\u00b11 , Vi\u00b11 ] \u2192 C such that \u03b1G (\u03c7) = \u03b1T (\u03c7) \u25e6\n1/g\n1/g\ni \u25e6 S. (0.1), (2.5.1) and (2.7.1) show us that \u03b1T (\u03c7)(Vi ) = a0 , \u03b1T (\u03c7)(Ui ) = a0 bi .\nUsing explicit formulas for i \u25e6 S (Section 1), we can represent \u03b1G (\u03c7)(\u03c4p,\u2217 ) as\npolynomials in \u03b1T (\u03c7)(Ui ), \u03b1T (\u03c7)(Vi ), i.e. as polynomials in a0 , b1 , b2 , . . . , bg (2.7.4).\nThe final result follows immediately from (0.4) and (2.7.4).\nStructure of the paper. In Section 1.1 we recall the definition of Satake\nmaps SG , ST and define generators of Hecke algebras H(G), H(Ms ). In 1.2, 1.3 we\nfind explicitly SG of these generators. Remark 1.4 is used only for a proof that 2\nmethods of finding of Hecke polynomial give the same result. Remark 1.5 gives a\nslightly other method of description of Satake map; some notations of 1.5 will be\nused later.\nSection 2.1 contains a definition of the induced representation and of the corresponding map \u03b1G (\u03c7) : H(G) \u2192 C. Sections 2.2 - 2.4 are of survey nature: they\ncontain explicit formulas for \u03b1G (\u03c7) using counting of cosets. A formula for \u03b1G (\u03c7)\nthat will be really used in future is given in 2.5. In 2.6 we recall properties of the\nmap r which is used to define the L-function of M, and in 2.7 we get an expression\nfor Weil numbers of M.\nIn 3.1 we recall the definition of parabolic subgroups of G and related groups.\nContents of other subsections 3.2 - 3.5 correspond to their titles. Finally, Section\n4 contains the end of the proof.\n1. Explicit description of Satake map.\n1.1.\u001a\u0012\nReferences: [AZh],\n\u0013\u001b [FCh].

Here we consider for\n\u2217 = G or Ms an element f \u2208 H(\u2217) as a \u2217(Zp )-biinvariant function on \u2217(Qp );\na function associated to a double coset is its characteristic function.

Let f be its the\ncharacteristic function, and X = Fj Fk . We have\nFj Fk = diag (1, . . . , 1, p, . . . , p, p2 , . . . , p2 , p2 , . . . , p2 , p, . . . , p, 1, . . . , 1), k > j,\nsizes of diagonal blocks here and below are\uf8ebg \u2212 k, k \u2212 j, j, \uf8f6\ng \u2212 k, k \u2212 j, j.\n\u0012\n\u0013\nu11 u12 u13\nEg A\nFor u =\nwhere A = \uf8ed ut12 u22 u23 \uf8f8 we have Fj Fk u =\n0 Eg\nut13 ut23 u33\n\u0012\n\u0013\nB C\n, where B = diag (1, . . . , 1, p, . . . , p, p2 , . . . , p2 ),\n0 D\n7\n\n\f\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\nu11\nu12\nu13\nD = diag (p2 , . . . , p2 , p, . . . , p, 1, . . . , 1), C = \uf8ed put12 pu22 pu23 \uf8f8.

The above formulas can be used for finding of the Hecke polynomial of X. Any element of H(G) defines a correspondence on X. We denote the\nalgebra of these correspondences by Tp , it is the quotient ring of H(G) by the only\nrelation \u03c4p,g = id .\nLet us consider the (good) reduction of X at p, denoted by X\u0303. We denote\nby Corr (X\u0303) its algebra of correspondences. Obviously there exists an inclusion\n\u03b3 : Tp \u2192 Corr (X\u0303). It is known that it can be included in the commutative\ndiagram:\nSG : H(G) \u2192\nH(Ms )\n\u03b21 \u2193\n\u03b22 \u2193\n\u03b3:\nTp\n\u2192 Corr (X\u0303)\nwhere \u03b21 is the natural projection, \u03b22 is an epimorphism with the same kernel\n\u03c4p,g \u2212 id .\nThere is the Frobenius map f : X\u0303 \u2192 X\u0303, we can consider it as a correspondence,\ni.e. f \u2208 Corr (X\u0303). We have: f = \u03b22 (\u03a60 ) in Corr (X\u0303), and \u03b22 (\u03a6g ) is the Verschiebung correspondence. The minimal polynomial satisfied by f over Tp is called\nthe Hecke polynomial.\nAn explicit algorithm of finding of the Hecke polynomial is a by-product of the\ncalculations of the present paper. There are 2 methods of finding of this polynomial:\nthe first one is to eliminate formally \u03a61 , . . . , \u03a6g from (1.2.1), (1.3.1) and to use the\nrelation \u03c4p,g = 1. The second one is to use a description of Langlands parameters\n8\n\n\fof unramified representations - this gives us formula (2.7.2). See Appendix, Table\n4 for the explicit formulas for the cases g = 2, 3.\nRemark 1.5. There is a slightly another method of the explicit finding of\nHecke polynomial. We denote by \u03a9(G) the Weyl group of G. It enters in the exact\nsequence\n0 \u2192 (Z/2Z)g \u2192 \u03a9(G) \u2192 S(g) \u2192 0\nand there exists a section i : S(g) \u2192 \u03a9(G). Let Ui , Vi (i = 1, . . . , g) be independent variables. We have: (see [FCh],\nCh. 7 for example) H(T ) is a subring of\n\u22121 \u00b11 Qg\n\u00b11\n\u00b11\nQ[Ui , Vi ] generated by (Ui Vi ) , i=1 Ui . \u03a9(G) acts on H(T ) by the obvious\nmanner (S(g) permutes indices in Ui , Vi , and (Z/2Z)g interchanges U , V ). Then\nH(G), H(Ms ) are subrings of H(T ) stable with respect to \u03a9(G), i(S(g)) respectively,\nand Satake maps SG , ST are identical inclusions.\nQ\nQ\nFor a subset I of 1, . . . , g we denote UI = i\u2208I Ui i6\u2208I Vi \u2208 H(T ). Then we\nhave:\nX\nST (\u03a6i ) =\nUI\n(1.5.1)\n#(I)=i\n\nQg\n(particularly, i=1 Vi is the Frobenius element and i=1 Ui is the Verschiebung).\n\u00b11\n\u00b11\nUsing (1.2.1), (1.3.1)\nPand (1.5.1)\nQg it is easy to find images of \u03c4p , \u03c4p,i in Q[Ui , Vi ]\n(for example, \u03c4p = I UI = i=1 (Ui + Vi )).\nQg\nRoots of Hecke polynomial are (Z/2Z)g -conjugates of i=1 Vi , i.e. elements UI .\nWe denote the i-th coefficient of the Hecke polynomial by hi \u2208 H(G). Hence,\nhi = (\u22121)i \u03c3i (UI ), i = 0, . . . , 2g , where \u03c3i is the i-th symmetric polynomial. hi can\nbe found explicitly using (1.2.1), (1.3.1).\nQg\n\n2.

From (2.7) we shall treat only one \u03c7 defined in Introduction, Step 3.\nWe can expand \u03c7 on B(Qp ) using the projection B \u2192 T , and let \u03c0\u03c7 : G(Qp ) \u2192\nGL(V) be the parabolically induced representation. Recall its definition: V is a\nspace of functions f : G(Qp ) \u2192 C which satisfy\n\u2200b \u2208 B(Qp ) f (bg) = \u03c7(b) * f (g)\nand the action is right translation:\n[\u03c0\u03c7 (t)(f )](g) = f (gt)\nThere exist a 1-dimensional subspace V G(Zp ) \u2282 V of G(Zp )-invariant functions, an\naction of H(G) on V G(Zp ) and hence a homomorphism \u03b1G (\u03c7) : H(G) \u2192 C.\n9\n\n\fThere are 2 methods of description of \u03b1G (\u03c7): the first one is based on consideration of decomposition of a double coset G(Zp )T G(Zp ), T \u2208 G, as a union of ordinary\ncosets. Really, if G(Zp )T G(Zp ) = \u222ai \u03b3i G(Zp ) then \u03b1G (\u03c7)(G(Zp )T G(Zp )) =\nP\n\u03c7(\u03b3\ni ). We treat this decomposition in Sections 2.2 - 2.4.\ni\nThe second method (which is much more convenient) is treated in 2.5. So,\nSections 2.2 -2.4 are entirely of survey nature.\n2.2. Here we consider for simplicity the case of G = GLn and a double coset\nG(Zp )Tp,i G(Zp ) for Tp,i = diag (1, . . . , 1, p, . . . , p), p occurs i times.

If such I is fixed then we consider the set of \u03b3 =\nsuch that\n0 D\nD=\n\nX\nj\u2208I\n\nA = pDt\n\n\u22121\n\n=\n\np * ejj +\nX\nj\u2208I\n\n(j 6\u2208 I, k \u2208 I, j < k)\n\nX\nj6\u2208I\n\nejj + p *\n\nB=\n\nejj +\n\nX\n\nX\nj,k\n\nX\n\nejj +\n\nj6\u2208I\n\ncjk * ejk ,\nX\nj,k\n\n\u2212cjk * ekj ,\n\nbjk ejk ,\n\nj,k\u2208I\n\nbjk , cjk belong to a fixed set of representatives of Fp in Z, and bjk = bkj .\nQ\nNow we use the same transformations as above. We have: \u03c7(p\u03b3i\u22121 ) = a0 i\u2208I ai\nand it is easy to see that\n\u03b1G (\u03c7)(Tp ) = a0\n\ng\nY\n\n(1 + bi )\n\n(2.3.1)\n\ni=1\n\n2.4. Here we consider the case G = GSp2g (Q), T = Tp,i . Firstly we describe a\nset J such that\ng\n[\nG(Zp )Tp,i G(Zp ) = \u222aj\u2208J G(Zp )\u03b3j\ni=0\n\nand then for each j\u0012\u2208 J we \u0013\nfind the corresponding i \u2208 0, . . . , g.\nA B\nWe have: \u03b3j =\n\u2208 GSp2g with \u03bb(\u03b3j ) = p2 . D is an upper-triangilar\n0 D\nmatrix whose diagonal entries Dii are pdi , di = 0, 1, 2, i.e. we have 3g possibilities for\nthe choice of di . To choose a set di is the same as to choose a partition {1, . . . , g} =\nI0 \u222a I1 \u222a I2 , i \u2208 Ik \u21d0\u21d2 di = k. Non-diagonal entries of D are described as follows:\n(1) If i \u2208 I0 , j \u2208 I1 , i < j then Dij runs through a system of representatives in Z\nof Z/p;\n(2) If i \u2208 I0 , j \u2208 I2 , i < j then Dij runs through a system of representatives in Z\nof Z/p2 ;\n(3) If i \u2208 I1 , j \u2208 I1 , i < j then Dij runs through a system of representatives in Z\nof Z/p, and the Jordan normal form of this part of D has blocks of size 1 or 2 (i.e.\nits square is 0);\n\u2032\n\u2032\n(4) If i \u2208 I1 , j \u2208 I2 , i < j then Dij = pDij\n, where Dij\nruns through a system of\nrepresentatives in Z of Z/p;\nOther Dij are 0. We denote submatrices of D described in (1) - (4) above by A,\nB, C, pD respectively.\nFurther, we have A = p2 D\u22121t , and the description of B = {Bij } is the following.\nFirstly, Bij = 0 if i \u2208 I0 or j \u2208 I0 . Further, we denote submatrices of B formed\n11\n\n\fby elements Bij with i \u2208 Ir , j \u2208 Is (r, s = 1, 2) by Brs . Entries of B11 , B21 (resp.\nB12 , B22 ) run through a system of representatives in Z of Z/p, (resp. of Z/p2 ).\nFinally, the above matrices satisfy the following relations (which are equivalent\nto a condition \u03b3j \u2208 GSp2g ):\n(1) Bt11 (pI + C) = (pI + Ct )B11\n(2) (pI + Ct )B12 = pBt11 D + p2 Bt21\n(3) Dt B12 + pB22 = Bt12 D + pBt22\n\nFor a given \u03b3j it is possible to find i such that \u03b3j \u2208 G(Zp )Tp,i G(Zp ). It is obvious\nthat i \u2264 #I1 .\nFor each set d = {di } we denote by C(d, k) the quantity of matrices \u03b3j described\nabove such that \u03b3j \u2208 G(Zp )Tp,k G(Zp ). In these notations we have the following\nformula:\ng\nY\nX\nadi i\n\u03b1G (\u03c7)(Tp,k ) =\nC(d, k)\ni=1\n\nd\n\nReally, it is more convenient to denote C\u0303(d, k) = C(d, k)p\u2212\n\u03b1G (\u03c7)(Tp,k ) =\n\nX\nd\n\nC\u0303(d, k)\n\ng\nY\n\nPg\n\ni=1\n\nidi\n\n, so\n\nbdi i\n\n(2.4.1)\n\ni=1\n\nFormulas for C\u0303(d, k) and \u03b1G (\u03c7)(Tp,k ) for g = 2, 3 are given in the appendix, tables\n5, 6.\n2.5. It is well-known that there exists a map \u03b1T (\u03c7) : H(T ) \u2192 C given by the\nformula\n1/g\n1/g\n\u03b1T (\u03c7)(Vi ) = a0 , \u03b1T (\u03c7)(Ui ) = a0 bi\n(2.5.1)\nsuch that\n\u03b1G (\u03c7) = \u03b1T (\u03c7) \u25e6 ST \u25e6 SG\n\n(2.5.2)\n\nCombining (2.5.1), (2.5.2) with (1.2.1), (1.3.1), (1.5.1), we get\n\n\u03b1G (\u03c7)(\u03c4p,i ) = a20\n\ng\nX\n\nk\u2212j+1\n2\n\n\u2212\n\nj,k\u22650,j+i\u2264k\n\nRk\u2212j (i) * p\n\n!\n\nX\n\nbJ\n\n#(J)=j\n\nX\n\nbK (2.5.3)\n\n#(K)=k\n\nComparing (2.4.1) and (2.5.3) we get immediately that for i = 1, . . . , g\n\nC\u0303(d, i) =\n\n[(q1 \u22121)/2]\n\nX\nj=0\n\n\u2212(q1 \u22122j+1)(q1 \u22122j)/2\n\nRq1 \u22122j (i)p\n\n\u0012\n\nq1\nj\n\n\u0013\n\n(2.5.4)\n\nwhere q1 = #I1 is the quantity of ones in d and [x] is the integer part of x.\n2.6. Here we recall a description of the finite-dimensional representation r :\nG \u2192 GL(W ) ([BR], 5.1), and its restriction to T\u0302 \u2282L G for our case G = GSp2g (Q)\n(this is well-known, see for example [BR], 5.1, Example C). So, firstly we describe\nthe spin representation and its restriction on Cartan subalgebra. The below facts\ncan be found in many sources; we use [J].\n12\nL\n\n\fThe dual of GSp2g is the spinor group GSpin2g+1 . Since G = GSp2g is over\nQ, we have: L G = WQ \u00d7 GSpin2g+1 , and r :L G \u2192 GL(W ) (see, for example,\n[BR], (5.1)) is trivial on WQ . It is known that r : GSpin2g+1 \u2192 GL(W ) is the spin\nrepresentation. There exists a 2-fold covering \u03b7 : GSpin2g+1 \u2192 GO2g+1 . Recall the\ndefinition of the corresponding representation of Lie algebras r : GO2g+1 \u2192 GL(W ).\nLet V be a vector space of dimension 2g + \uf8eb\n1, u1 , . . . , u\uf8f62g+1 its basis and B a\n1 0 0\n\uf8ed\nquadratic form whose matrix in this basis is\n0 0 1 \uf8f8, the size of diagonal\n0 1 0\nentries is 1, g, g. We consider the corresponding orthogonal Lie algebras GO(B),\nO(B). Their Cartan subalgebras of diagonal matrices TGO(B), resp. TO(B) have\nbases \u03b80 , \u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8g , resp. \u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8g , where \u03b80 is the 2g + 1 \u00d7 2g + 1 unit matrix\nand \u03b8i = ei+1,i+1 \u2212 ei+g+1,i+g+1 for i > 0, eij is an elementary matrix ([J], p. 139,\n(63)).\nP\u221e\nThe Clifford algebra C = C(V, B) is the quotient of n=0 V \u2297n (the tensor algebra of V ) by relations v1 \u2297v2 +v2 \u2297v1 = 2B(v1 , v2 ). Let L(C)P\nbe the corresponding\n\u221e\nLie algebra, M1 \u2282 C the natural projection of V = V \u22971 \u2282 n=0 V \u2297n to C, and\nM2 = [M1 , M1 ]. It is known ([J], p. 231, Th. 7) that M2 is a Lie subalgebra of\nL(C), and it is isomorphic to O(B). Further, M1 is isomorphic to V as a vector\nspace, and the Lie action of M2 on M1 defined by the formula x(y) = xy \u2212 yx (here\nx \u2208 M2 , y \u2208 M1 , multiplication is in C), coincides with the action (of a matrix on\na vector) of O(B) on V .\nThis formula permits to get an explicit identification of O(B) and M2 . Namely,\nwe denote vi = u1 ui+1 , wi = u1 ui+1+g , multiplication is in C, vi , wi \u2208 M2 . We\nhave:\n1 1\n(2.6.1)\nfor i > 0 \u03b8i \u2208 O(B) corresponds to + vi wi \u2208 M2\n2 2\n(calculations are similar to [J], p. 233, (34) or can be deduced easily from these\nformulas; it is necessary to take into consideration that hi of page 139 are \u03b8i and\nhi of page 233 are \u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8i+1 ).\nFor I = (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1k ) \u2282 (1, . . . , g) we set xI = v1 * . . .* vg * w\u03b11 * . . .* w\u03b1k . The space\nof spin representation W is a subspace of C spanned on all vectors xI . The action\nof O(B) is the right multiplication by the corresponding elements of M2 . This is\nexactly r restricted on O(B). (2.6.1) shows that\n\u03b8i (xI ) = \u01ebxI\n\n(2.6.2)\n\nwhere \u01eb = 21 if i \u2208 I and \u01eb = \u2212 12 if i 6\u2208 I.\nFinally, it is known that \u03b80 acts on W by multiplication by 12 .\nLet T\u0302 \u2282 GSpin2g+1 be the dual torus of T \u2282 GSp2g , T\u0302 its Lie algebra and \u03b7Lie : T\u0302 \u2192 TGO(B) the restriction of \u03b7. For t \u2208 T we set\n\u22121\nt = diag (x1 , . . . , xg , \u03bbx\u22121\n1 , . . . , \u03bbxg ), so we can consider \u03bb, x1 , . . . , xg as a basis of X \u2217 (T ). We denote the dual basis of X \u2217 (T\u0302 ) by \u03bb\u2032 , x\u20321 , . . . , x\u2032g and we consider \u03bb\u2032 , x\u20321 , . . . , x\u2032g as coordinates of an element t \u2208 T\u0302 . Further, we denote by\n\u03bd0 , \u03bd1 , . . . , \u03bdg the basis of T\u0302 dual to \u03bb\u2032 , x\u20321 , . . . , x\u2032g . Formulas for \u03b7Lie in bases \u03bd\u2217 , \u03b8\u2217\nare the following:\n\u03b7Lie (\u03bd0 ) = 2\u03b80 ,\n\n\u03b7Lie (\u03bdi ) = \u03b8i + \u03b80\n13\n\n(2.6.3)\n\n\f(2.6.2), (2.6.3) imply formulas for the action of \u03bdi on xI : r(\u03bdi )(xI ) = xI if i = 0 or\ni \u2208 I, r(\u03bdi )(xI ) = 0 if i 6\u2208 I. In its turn, these formulas imply formulas for r|T\u0302 :\nr(\u03bb\u2032 , x\u20321 , . . . , x\u2032g )(xI ) = (\u03bb\u2032\n\nY\n\nx\u2032i )xI\n\n(2.6.4)\n\ni\u2208I\n\n(see also [BR], end of (5.1)).\n2.7. Here we apply r to a Langlands element \u03b8\u03c0\u03c7 \u2208 L G of \u03c0\u03c7 in order to find\nWeil numbers of MP .\nWe can choose \u03b8\u03c0\u03c7 in T\u0302 ; namely, it is known that \u03bb\u2032 , x\u20321 , . . . , x\u2032g -coordinates of\n\u03b8\u03c0\u03c7 are\n(a0 , b1 , . . . , bg )\n(2.7.1)\n(2.6.4) and (2.7.1) imply that\n(2.7.2) \u2200I \u2282 {1, . . . , g} the element xI is an eigenelement of r(\u03b8\u03c0\u03c7 ) with eigenvalue a0 bI = \u03b1T (\u03c7)(UI ).\nFrom here we fix \u03c7 such that \u03c0\u03c7 = \u03c0p - the p-part of \u03c0 of Introduction.

The above formulas give us a simple proof that \u03b1G (\u03c7)( hi T i ) is the\ncharacteristic polynomial of r(\u03b8\u03c0\u03c7 ) (this is well-known; see, for example, [B] for less\nexplicit proof in a more general situation). Really, roots of the Hecke polynomial\nare UI (I runs over 2g ), and \u03b1T (\u03c7)(UI ) = rI (\u03b8\u03c0\u03c7 ).\n3. Some explicit formulas for archimedean cohomological representations of G.\n3.1. Description of parabolic subgroups of G.\nThe set of simple positive roots that corresponds to a Borel pair (T, B) of G is:\n\u03c90 = x21 \u03bb\u22121 , \u03c9i = xi+1 x\u22121\ni ,\n\u03bb, xi of 2.6. We denote this set by \u2206.\n14\n\ni = 1, . . . , g \u2212 1,\n\n\fParabolic subgroups that contain B are in one-to-one correspondence to the\nset of subsets of \u2206. We shall tell that such a subgroup is of the first type if the\ncorresponding subset of \u2206 does not contain \u03c90 , and of the second type, if it contains\n\u03c90 . The set of subgroups of both types is isomorphic to the set of ordered partitions\nof g, i.e. the set of representations of g as a sum\ng = b1 + b2 + * * * + bk\n\n(3.1.1)\n\nwhere bi \u2265 1, the order is essential. We denote mi = b1 +* * * bi\u22121 (i = 1, . . . , k). The\nsubset of \u2206 that corresponds to (3.1.1) is \u2206 \u2212 {\u03c90 , \u03c9m2 , \u03c9m3 , . . . , \u03c9mk } for the first\ntype, \u2206 \u2212 {\u03c9m2 , \u03c9m3 , . . . , \u03c9mk } for the second type. We denote the corresponding\nparabolic subgroup by P and its Levi decomposition by P = M N . Their description\nis the following:\nFirst type:\nM=\n\n\u0012\n\nA 0\n0 D\n\n\u0013\n\n(1M )\n\nwhere A, D are block diagonal matrices with sizes of blocks b1 , b2 , . . . , bk .

We have\nTc = \u03b1T \u03b1\u22121\n\n(3.1.2)\n\nWe denote Mc = \u03b1M \u03b1\u22121 and analogically for other objects (N , K etc.).\n3.2. Finding of \u03a9R (G).\nHere we recall an explicit description of \u03a9R (G) which is necessary for finding of\n\u03a0P , see 3.3 below. It is possible to use a fact that it contains a subgroup \u03a9(Kc ) of\nindex 2, but we give a direct calculation. We denote the normalizer by N. There is\nan isomorphism N(Tc )/Tc = \u03a9(G) and a section of sets \u03b3 : \u03a9(G) \u2192 N(Tc ). (3.1.2)\nimplies that N(Tc ) = \u03b1N(T )\u03b1\u22121 . Let j = 1, . . . , g, ej = (1, . . . , 1, \u22121, 1, . . . , 1) \u2208\n(Z/2Z)g \u2282 \u03a9(G) (\u22121 \u0013\nis at the j-th place). A representative of ej in N(T ) is wj =\n\u0012\nEg \u2212 ejj\niejj\n. It commutes with \u03b1, i.e. we can set \u03b3(ej ) = wj .

Then we have \u03b3(w) =\n.\n0\nMw\nIt belongs to N(T ), Nc (T ) and commutes with \u03b1.\nThis means that \u03a9R (G) contains a subgroup X \u2282 \u03a9(G) given by an exact sequence\n0 \u2192 Z/2Z \u2192 X \u2192 S(g) \u2192 0\nwhere Z/2Z \u2282 (Z/2Z)g is the diagonal embedding. Really, it is possible to show\nthat X = \u03a9R (G), i.e. elements of (Z/2Z)g , except the diagonal element, cannot be\nlifted to G(R).\nFinally, for a subset Q\nI of {1, . . . , g} - or, the same, an element I \u2208 (Z/2Z)g \u2282\n\u03a9(G) - we set \u03b3(I) = j\u2208I wj , and we denote this element by wI .\n3.3. Finding of \u03a0P .\n\nThe members of \u03a0P are parametrized by the double coset space\n\u03a9(Mc )\\\u03a9(G)/\u03a9R (G)\n([BR], 4.2). We have: \u03a9(Mc ) = S(b1 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 S(bk ) for P of the first type and\n\u03a9(Mc ) = \u03a9(GSp2b1 ) \u00d7 S(b2 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 S(bk ) for P of the second type. The set\nof representatives of \u03a9(G)/\u03a9R (G) can be chosen as a half of (Z/2Z)g (we choose\none element in each pair of elements (a, (\u22121, . . . , \u22121)a), a \u2208 (Z/2Z)g ). The above\ngroups \u03a9(Mc ) act on this set of representatives from the left, hence the invariant\nof their action is the quantity of 1, \u22121 in the segments of length b1 , b2 , . . . , bk (first\ntype); b2 , . . . , bk (second type) in the whole segment of length g. This means that\nthe set \u03a0P coincides with\n16\n\n\fFirst type: the set of sequences of numbers c1 , . . . , ck where 0 \u2264 cj \u2264 bj factorized by the equivalence relation c1 , . . . , ck \u223c b1 \u2212 c1 , . . . , bk \u2212 ck ; representatives w\nof the corresponding double cosets are\nw = ( 1, . . . , 1 , \u22121, . . . , \u22121 , . . . , 1, . . . , 1 , \u22121, . . . , \u22121 ) \u2208 (Z/2Z)g \u2282 \u03a9(G)\n| {z } | {z }\n| {z } | {z }\nc1 times b1 \u2212c1 times\nck times bk \u2212ck times\n\n(3.3.1)\n\nSecond type: the same, but the sequences are c2 , . . . , ck , and\n\nw = ( 1, . . . , 1 , 1, . . . , 1 , \u22121, . . . , \u22121 , . . . , 1, . . . , 1 , \u22121, . . . , \u22121 ) \u2208 (Z/2Z)g \u2282 \u03a9(G)\n| {z } | {z } | {z }\n| {z } | {z }\nb1 times c2 times b2 \u2212c2 times\nck times bk \u2212ck times\n(3.3.2)\nNotation: such a sequence c1 , . . . , ck or c2 , . . . , ck is denoted by c and the set of all\nthere sequences by C. We denote the set of w \u2208 \u03a9(G) of the form (3.3.1), (3.3.2)\nby W, i.e. there is a 1 - 1 correspondence between C and W: w = w(c), c = c(w).\nThe representation \u03c0 \u2208 \u03a0P that corresponds to c is denoted by \u03c0c or (like in [BR])\nby \u03c0w .\n3.4. Finding of pw , qw .1\nNumbers pw , qw are defined in [BR], 4.3; here we use notations of this paper.\nFirstly we recall the definition of Pc\u00b1 and find them explicitly. Let h : Res C/R Gm \u2192\nG be a Deligne\nmap\u0013for the Siegel variety. We use the following h: for z = x + iy\n\u0012\nx y\nh(z, z\u0304) =\n. Let i1 : Gm \u2192 Res C/R Gm be the map z \u2192 (z, 1) and\n\u2212y x\n\u03bc = h \u25e6 i1 . Pc\u00b1 are the subspaces of GSp2g on which ad \u03bc(t) acts by t\u22121 and t\nrespectively (see for example [D] or [BR], 4.3). An element of GSp2g is a matrix\n\u0012\n\u0013\nA\nB\nwhere B, C are symmetric. A calculation gives us:\nC \u2212At + (\u03bb \u2212 1)Eg\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nC iC\nC\n\u2212iC\n+\n\u2212\nPc =\n, Pc =\niC \u2212C\n\u2212iC \u2212C\nwhere C is a symmetric g \u00d7 g-matrix.\nFor w \u2208 W \u2282 \u03a9(G) we have \u03b3(w) = wI for I = the set of \u22121\u2032 s in (3.3.1),\n(3.3.2); we denote it simply by w. Further, we denote by N , Nw , Nc , Ncw the Lie\nalgebras of N , w\u22121 N w, Nc , w\u22121 N cw respectively. Numbers pw = dim (Ncw \u2229Pc+ ),\nqw = dim (Ncw \u2229 Pc\u2212 ) are defined in [BR], 4.3. It is more convenient\nconjugate\n\u0012 to \u0013\n0 C\nwith \u03b1: we set P \u00b1 = \u03b1\u22121 Pc\u00b1 \u03b1. A calculation gives: P + =\n, P\u2212 =\n0\n0\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0 0\nwhere C is a symmetric g \u00d7 g-matrix. So, pw = dim (N \u2229 wP + w\u22121 ),\nC 0\nqw = dim (N \u2229 wP \u2212 w\u22121 ).\nFurther, N has the same description like in (1N), (2N), but the diagonal blocks\nare 0-matrices.\nLet ei,j be the elementary (i, j)-matrix.

Finding of length of representatives of \u03a9(Mc )/\u03a9(Mc \u2229 wKc w\u22121 ).\nWe continue to work with the same w \u2208 W, w \u2208 N(Tc ) from 3.4. To prove\nproposition 4.3 below, we must find representatives of the minimal length of\n\u03a9(Mc )/\u03a9(Mc \u2229 wKc w\u22121 ), and find their length (see [BR], 4.3 or [A], proof of\n(9.1)).

Like in (3.4), we have a table of w-conjugates of elementary matrix ei,j (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 g):\nSubtype\nwei,j w\u22121\n1. i 6\u2208 I, j 6\u2208 I ei,j\n\u2208 M \u21d0\u21d2 (\u2217)\n2. i \u2208 I, j 6\u2208 I eg+i,j\n6\u2208 M (Type 1); \u2208 M \u21d0\u21d2 i, j \u2208 (1, . . . , b1 ) (Type 2)\n3. i 6\u2208 I, j \u2208 I ei,g+j\n6\u2208 M (Type 1); \u2208 M \u21d0\u21d2 i, j \u2208 (1, . . . , b1 ) (Type 2)\n4. i \u2208 I, j \u2208 I eg+i,g+j\n\u2208 M \u21d0\u21d2 (\u2217)\nwhere (*) here means: i, j belong to the same segment of the partition g =\nb1 * * * + bk .\nThis means that\n\u22121\n\nM \u2229 wKw\n\n=\n\ng\nY\nl=1\n\n= GL(b1 ) \u00d7\n\ng\nY\nl=2\n\nGL(cl ) \u00d7 GL(bl \u2212 cl ) (Type 1);\n\nGL(cl ) \u00d7 GL(bl \u2212 cl ) (Type 2)\n\nis the set of block diagonal simplectic matrices with block sizes\nc1 , b1 \u2212 c1 , . . . , ck , bk \u2212 ck , c1 , b1 \u2212 c1 , . . . , ck , bk \u2212 ck (Type 1)\n;\nb1 , c2 , b2 \u2212 c2 , . . . , ck , bk \u2212 ck , b1 , c2 , b2 \u2212 c2 , . . . , ck , bk \u2212 ck (Type 2)\n, and\n\u22121\n\n\u03a9(Mc )/\u03a9(Mc \u2229 wKc w\n\n= (Z/2Z)\n\nb1\n\n\u00d7\n\ng\nY\nl=2\n\n)=\n\ng\nY\nl=1\n\nS(bl )/(S(cl ) \u00d7 S(bl \u2212 cl )) (Type 1);\n\nS(bl )/(S(cl ) \u00d7 S(bl \u2212 cl )) (Type 2)\n19\n\n\fThe set S(b)/(S(c)\u00d7S(b\u2212c)) is isomorphic to S(c, b) - the set of all subsets of order\nc of the set (1, . . . , b) (see Introduction, Step 2c). Let D \u2208 S(c, b), D = (d1 , . . . , dc ),\nwhere 1 \u2264 d1 < * * * < dc \u2264 b. The equivalence class that corresponds to this D is the\nset of permutations of (1, . . . , b) that send (1, . . . , c) to (d1 , . . . , dc ). Since the length\nof a permutation (considered as an element of S(b) = \u03a9(GL(b +1)) ) is the quantity\nof inversions of elements, it is easy to see that the permutation with the minimal\nlength in the equivalence class corresponding to D is the permutation that sends j\nto dj for j = 1, . . . , c, and analogously (in increasing order) for j = c + 1, . . . , b. We\nPc\n.\ndenote this permutation by mD \u2208 S(b); we have l(mD ) = j=1 dj \u2212 c(c+1)\n2\nb1\nFurther, let a = (a1 , . . . , ab1 ) \u2208 (Z/2Z) \u2282 \u03a9(G), where ai = 0, 1. It is known\nPb1\nthat l(a) = i=1\niai .\nFinally, the set of representatives of \u03a9(Mc )/\u03a9(Mc \u2229 wKc w\u22121 ) of minimal length\nis S(c, P ) of (0.3). Really, let \u03c1 \u2208 S(c, P ), \u03c1 = (D1 , . . . , Dk ) for P of the first type,\n\u03c1 = (a, D2 , . . . , Dk ) for P of the second type, where Di is a subset of order ci of\nthe i-th segment of the partition g = b1 * * * + bk of (1, . . . , g) and a is as above.\nWe have mDi \u2208 S(bi ). For P of type 1 the representative of minimal length is\nm\u03c1 = mD1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 mDk \u2208 S(b1 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 S(bk ) \u2282 S(g) \u2282 \u03a9(G), and we have\nl(m\u03c1 ) =\n\nk\nX\n\nl(mDi )\n\n(3.5.1)\n\ni=1\n\nFor P of type 2 we let m\u2032\u03c1 = mD2 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 mDk \u2208 S(b2 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 S(bk ) \u2282 S(g) \u2282 \u03a9(G)\nand m\u03c1 = (a multiplied semidirectly by m\u2032\u03c1 ) \u2208 \u03a9(G). We have\nl(m\u03c1 ) = l(a) +\n\nk\nX\n\nl(mDi )\n\n(3.5.2)\n\ni=2\n\nRemark. It is convenient to treat numbers\n\u0012\n\u0013fi = di \u2212 i instead of di , so f1 \u2264\n\u2217 \u2217\nf2 \u2264 * * * \u2264 fc \u2264 b \u2212 c. For the case P =\n(i.e. P of type 1, k = 1), c = {c},\n0 \u2217\nw = w(c) we have hpw +r,qw +r (g, Kc ; \u03c0w ) = the quantity of Young diagrams of\nweight r in the rectangle with sides c, g \u2212 c. Analogous formulas exist for other P .\n4. Relations between Hecke eigenvalues.\nFormulas (3.5.1), (3.5.2) can be used in order to find dimensions of\nH i,j (g, Kc ; \u03c0w )\n([BR], 4.3). They give us also relations between Weil numbers of MP . The preliminary form of these relations is the following:\nProposition 4.1. For any c \u2208 C there is a number xc such that the set of all\nWeil numbers of MP is the following:\npl(m\u03c1 ) xc\nwhere c runs over C, for a fixed c \u03c1 runs over S(c, P ).\n20\n\n\fWe shall not give a proof of (4.1), because we need a more general proposition\n4.3, see below.\nComparing (4.1) with (2.7.2), we get the following problem:\n(4.2). Find relations between bi = pi ai such that both (2.7.2), (4.1) are satisfied.\nThe solution of (4.2) - and even a more exact result - is given by the following\nproposition. Recall that mj = b1 + * * * bj\u22121 (j = 1, . . . , k).\nProposition 4.3. First type: bmj +1 are free variables, bmj +i = pi\u22121 bmj +1\nQg\n(i = 1, . . . , bj ), and a0 is defined by the equality a20 i=1 bi = pg(g+1)/2 .\nSecond type: bj = pj for j = 1, . . . , b1 , bmj +1 (2 \u2264 j \u2264 k) are free variables,\nbmj +i and a0 are like in the first type.\nProof. It follows immediately from [A], proof of Proposition 9.1. Let us recall\nsome definitions of loc. cit., page 62 (here \u03c0 \u2208 \u03a0P , g = GSp2g ):\nV\u03c0 =\n\nM\n\nH i (g, Kc ; \u03c0),\n\nVP = V\u03a8P =\n\ni\n\nM\n\nV\u03c0\n\n\u03c0\u2208\u03a0P\n\n(VP is denoted in [A] by V\u03c8 and is defined on the page 59, two lines below (9.2)).\nSpaces V\u03c0 , W are sl2 (C)-modules (see loc. cit. for the definition of the action of\nsl2 (C)), and all V\u03c0 and hence VP have the Hodge decomposition.\nThere exist bases B(W ), B(V\u03c0 ), B(VP ) of W , V\u03c0 , VP respectively and an isomorphism d : B(VP ) \u2192 B(W ) (see [A], line below (9.6)) which gives an isomorphism\nof sl2 (C)-modules VP \u2192 W .\nArthur uses a slightly another description of B(W ) than the one used in (2.6).\nNamely, the set of elements of B(W ) is isomorphic to the set of cosets \u03a9(G)/\u03a9(Kc ),\ni\n\ni\n\nwhere \u03a9(Kc ) \u0592\u2192 \u03a9(G) is equal to S(g) \u0592\u2192 \u03a9(G) of Remark 1.5. It is clear that\n\u03a9(G)/\u03a9(Kc ) = (Z/2Z)g . Let I \u2282 {1, . . . , g}; we can treat I as an element of\n(Z/2Z)g as usually. The element of B(W ) that correspond to I according loc.cit.\nis exactly xI of (2.6).\nNow let \u03c0 = \u03c0w , w = w(c). The set B(V\u03c0 ) is isomorphic to \u03a9(Mc )/\u03a9(Mc \u2229\nwKc w\u22121 ) = S(c, P ). For any finite group A and its subgroups B, C we have\n[\nA/B =\nC/(C \u2229 aBa\u22121 )\n(4.3.1)\na\u2208C\\A/B\n\nhere and below all unions are disjoint.\nNow we apply (4.3.1) to the case A = \u03a9(G), B = Kc , C = \u03a9(Mc ) in order to\nget an inclusion:\ndw\n\nB(V\u03c0 ) = \u03a9(Mc )/\u03a9(Mc \u2229 wKc w\u22121 ) = S(c, P ) \u0592\u2192 \u03a9(G)/\u03a9(Kc ) = (Z/2Z)g = B(W )\nIt follows from loc. cit. that for \u03c1 \u2208 S(c, P ) as in the end of (3.5) we have:\ndw (\u03c1) = xI where for Type 1:\nI = D1 \u222a * * * \u222a Dk\n\n(4.3.2)\n\nI = Ia \u222a D2 \u222a * * * \u222a Dk\n21\n\n(4.3.3)\n\nfor Type 2:\n\n\fwhere Ia \u2282 {1, . . . , b1 } is the set of ones (additive writing of (Z/2Z)g ) in a, the\nunion is in {1, . . . , g}. The Hodge type of dw (\u03c1) is\npw + l(m\u03c1 ), qw + l(m\u03c1 )\nFinally, we have\nB(VP ) =\n\n[\n\n(4.3.4)\n\nB(V\u03c0 )\n\n\u03c0\u2208\u03a0P\n\nand d : B(VP ) \u2192 B(W ) is the union of dw in the obvious sense.\nLet X, Y , H be the standard basis of sl2 (C). We have the following properties\nof the action of ad X on V\u03c0 and W :\n(4.3.5) If v \u2208 V\u03c0 is of the pure Hodge type (p, q) then ad X(v) is of the pure\nHodge type (p + 1, q + 1).\n(4.3.6) If w \u2208 W is a r(\u03b8\u03c0\u03c7 )-eigenelement of eigenvalue \u03bb, then ad X(w) is a\nr(\u03b8\u03c0\u03c7 )-eigenelement of eigenvalue p\u03bb.\nType 1. We use notations ej = (0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, . . . , 0) \u2208 C (1 is at the j-th place),\nI(n) is a subset of {1, . . . , g} consisting of the single element n, and we denote\nxI(n) simply by xn . We fix some j and we set c = ej . (4.3.2) shows that d(V\u03c0c ) is\ngenerated by xmj +1 , . . . , xmj +bj . According (4.3.4), \u2200i = 1, . . . , bj the Hodge type\nof xmj +i is pc + i, qc + i. (4.3.5) implies that\nad X(xmj +i ) = cj,i xmj +i+1\n\n(4.3.7)\n\nwhere cj,i is some non-0 coefficient. Now, (2.7.2), (4.3.6) and (4.3.7) imply immediately that bmj +i+1 = pbmj +i which is 4.3 for Type 1.\nType 2. The idea of the proof is the same. Firstly we consider c = (0, . . . , 0).\nB(V\u03c0c ) is the set of subsets of {1, . . . , b1 }. (4.3.3) shows that d(V\u03c0c ) is generated\nby xI , where I \u2282 {1, . . . , b1 }. (4.3.5) implies that for \u2200i = 1, . . . , b1\n(ad X)i (x\u2205 ) =\nI\u2282{1,...,b1 }\n\nX\n\nsuch that\n\ncI xI\n\n(4.3.8)\n\nl(I)=i\n\nwhere coefficients cI can be easily found using methods of [VZ]. For us it is sufficient\nto use a fact that cI(i) 6= 0. (2.7.2), (4.3.6) and (4.3.8) imply by induction by i that\nbi = pi .\nFinally, we consider c = ej like in Type 1, but with the first zero omitted. B(V\u03c0c ) = (Z/2Z)b1 \u00d7 {1, . . . , bj }. (4.3.3) shows that d(V\u03c0c ) is generated\nby xJ\u222aI(mj +i) , where J \u2282 {1, . . . , b1 } and i \u2208 {1, . . . , bj }. The Hodge type of\nxJ\u222aI(mj +i) is pc + l(J) + i, qc + l(J) + i. (4.3.5) implies that for \u2200i = 1, . . . , bj\n(ad X)i\u22121 (x\u2205\u222aI(mj +1) ) =\n\nX\n\ncJ,j,n xJ\u222aI(mj +n)\n\n(4.3.9)\n\nthe sum is over the pairs (J, n), J \u2282 {1, . . . , b1 }, n \u2208 {1, . . . , bj } such that l(J)+n =\ni.\nAgain it is sufficient to use a fact that c\u2205,j,i 6= 0. As earlier (2.7.2), (4.3.6) and\n(4.3.9) imply by induction by i that bmj +i = pi\u22121 bmj +1 . \u0003\n22\n\n\fRemark 1. There are g \u2212k (first type); g \u2212k +1 (second type) relations between\neigenvalues of \u03c4p , \u03c4p,i on MP .\nRemark 2. (4.1) is obviously a corollary of (4.3); numbers xc are products of\nsome bi and powers of p.\nRemark 3. Formulas of (4.3) are not direct corollaries of (4.1), (2.7.2): it is\neasy to construct an example of numbers ai having another form as in (4.3) but\nsuch that both (4.1), (2.7.2) are satisfied.\nWe denote m(\u03c4p ), m(\u03c4p,i ) by mp , mp,i respectively.\nTheorem 4.4. Relations between m2p , mp,i are linear. Particularly, for the\nparabolic subgroup P of the second type such that k = g, all bi are 1 (see Appendix,\n8b) the only relation between m2p , mp,i is the following:\ng\n\nX\nm2p\nYi mp,i = 0\n+\n(p + 1)2 i=1\n\n(4.5)\n\nwhere mp,g = 1 and Yi are polynomials in p (particularly, they do not depend on\ng) defined as follows: Y1 = \u22121 and Yn is defined by the recurrence relation\n[\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\n2\n\n\u2212\n\nYi Rn\u22121 (i)](1 + p )p\n\n(n\u22121)n\n2\n\n+[\n\ni=1\n\nn\nX\n\nYi Rn (i)]p\u2212\n\nn(n+1)\n+1\n2\n\ni=1\n\n+[\n\nn\u22122\nX\n\nYi Rn\u22122 (i)]p\u2212\n\n(n\u22122)(n\u22121)\n+1\n2\n\n+2 =0\n\n(4.6)\n\ni=1\n\nProof.
