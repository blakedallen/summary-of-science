This type of behavior has recently been observed for periodically sheared colloidal suspensions and we demonstrate that driven vortex systems exhibit remarkably similar behavior. We also\nprovide evidence that the onset of irreversible behavior is a dynamical phase transition.\nPACS numbers: 05.40.-a,05.60.-k,82.70.Dd\n\nRecent experiments on periodic shearing of colloidal\nsuspensions in a viscous media where thermal effects are\nnegligible have shown a transition from reversible behavior to an irreversible motion as a function of increasing\nparticle density [1, 2]. The reversible and irreversible\nregimes were identified by measuring the net displacement of the colloids after each cycle of a periodic shear.\nIn the reversible regime, the colloids return to their initial\nposition at the end of each cycle, while in the irreversible\nregime, the colloids do not return to their starting point.\nA stroboscopic measurement of the displacements in the\nirreversible regime reveals that the colloids undergo an\nanisotropic random walk, with larger displacements in\nthe shear direction. For a given colloid density, there is a\nthreshold for the transition from reversible to irreversible\nbehavior as a function of the strain amplitude or the\ndistance the particles are sheared per cycle. The strain\nthreshold decreases as the colloid concentration increases,\nindicating that colloid-colloid interactions play an important role in the transition. More recent modeling of this\nsystem has provided evidence that the reversible to irreversible transition is a nonequilibrium phase transition\nwith power law divergences near the transition [3]. Other\nexperiments on dilute sheared colloidal suspensions also\nindicate the importance of the particle interactions in\nproducing irreversible or chaotic flow behaviors [4].\nIn this work, we consider whether the general features\nof the reversible and irreversible behaviors observed in\nthe sheared colloidal system can be realized in a wider\nclass of nonequilibrium many-particle systems. Driven\nparticles moving over random quenched disorder provide\nan ideal class of systems for studying this issue [5]. Physical realizations of such systems include vortices in type-II\nsuperconductors [6, 7], driven Wigner crystals [8], magnetic bubble arrays [9], driven pattern forming systems\n[10], and colloids moving over random landscapes [11].\nIn the presence of strong quenched disorder, plastic flow\nregimes occur in these systems even in the absence of any\nthermal effects. In the case of vortices, it has been established that transitions from plastic flow to smectic or\nelastic flow states can be induced as a function of increasing dc driving force [6]. It is not known whether there\n\ncould also be a reversible to irreversible flow transition\nin the presence of some form of periodic forcing.\nTo address this question, we examine the specific system of vortices interacting with random quenched disorder, and measure vortex displacements after successive\ncycles of a periodic drive. Vortex lattices have been used\nextensively as a general system in which to understand\nvarious nonequilibrium many-body effects since numerous simulations and experiments can be performed readily over a wide range of parameters. It has been shown\nthat many of the nonequilibrium effects observed in the\nvortex system also occur in other systems such as driven\ncolloidal assemblies [11, 12]; thus, we expect that our\nresults will be generic to other driven interacting point\nparticle systems with quenched disorder.\nThe simulation system consists of a two-dimensional\nsample of size L \u00d7 L with periodic boundary conditions\nin the x and y directions. The sample contains Nv vortices at a vortex density of nv = Nv /L2 . The vortexPNv\nvortex interaction force is Fvv\ni =\ni6=j f0 K1 (Rij /\u03bb)R\u0302ij ,\nwhere K1 is a modified Bessel function, Rij = |Ri \u2212 Rj |\nis the distance between vortex i and j located at Ri\nand Rj , R\u0302ij = (Ri \u2212 Rj )/Rij , f0 = \u03c60 /(2\u03c0\u03bc0 \u03bb3 ),\n\u03bb is the London penetration depth, and \u03c6 = h/2e is\nthe flux quantum. Lengths are measured in units of\n\u03bb and the sample size is L = 64\u03bb. For Rij > \u03bb\nthe vortex interaction falls off rapidly, so a finite cutoff on the interaction range is placed at Rij = 6\u03bb. The\nquenched disorder is modeled as Np = 100 randomly\nplaced parabolic pinning traps of radius rp = 0.3\u03bb and\nPN\nstrength F p , with Fpi = k p F p (Rik /rp )\u0398(rp \u2212 Rik )R\u0302ik ,\nwhere \u0398 is the Heaviside step function, Rik = |Ri \u2212 Rpk |,\nR\u0302ik = (Ri \u2212 Rpk )/Rij , and Rpk is the location of pin k.\nThe periodic drive is produced by the Lorentz force from\na square wave current of period \u03c4 , which we model as\nFext (t) = F ext sgn(sin(2\u03c0t/\u03c4 ))x\u0302, such that a vortex under the influence of only the driving force undergoes a\ndisplacement of d = F ext \u03c4 /2\u03b7 in half a drive cycle. In\nthis work, except where indicated, we fix F ext = 0.8f0\nand vary d by changing \u03c4 . The overdamped equation of\n\n\f2\nmotion for a single vortex i is\n\u03b7\n\ndRi\np\next\n= Fvv\n(t),\ni + Fi + F\ndt\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b7 = 1 is the viscous damping term. The vortices\nare initialized in random positions. We use the same\nprotocol as in Ref. [1] to stroboscopically determine the\nvortex locations after each drive cycle and extract the\neffective diffusivities. The mean square vortex displacement Rxd and Ryd in the x and y directions is measured\nas a function of the number n of drive cycles:\nd\nR\u03b1\n(n\u03c4 ) = Nv\u22121\n\nNv\nX\n\n[(Ri (t0 + n\u03c4 ) \u2212 Ri (t0 )) * \u03b1\u0302]2\n\ny\n\ny\n\n(a)\n\nx\n\n(c)\n\nx\n\n(d)\n\nx\n\n(2)\n\ni\n\nwhere \u03b1 = x, y. From this quantity we follow Ref. [1] and\nd\ndefine an effective diffusivity D\u03b1 = R\u03b1\n/2t. When the behavior is reversible the vortices return to their initial pod\nsitions after each drive cycle and Rx,y\nand Dx,y are zero.\nd\nWe observe an initial transient period of finite Rx,y\n, after which the system settles into a stationary state that\nis either reversible or irreversible. The diffusivities are\nmeasured only after this stationary state is reached. A\nsimilar transient behavior was observed in the shearing\nexperiments of Ref. [1]. We also measure the vortex veP v\nlocity in the x direction given by Vx = Nv\u22121 N\ni vi * x\u0302,\nwhere vi is the velocity of vortex i. In all of our simulations, Nv > Np so that we avoid any regimes where the\nvortices are all pinned. For all of the parameter sets considered in this work, the vortices in the reversible regime\nare moving during the drive cycle.\nWe find a transition from reversible to irreversible behavior as a function of displacement per cycle d and vortex density nv . In Fig. 1(a) we highlight the locations\nof the vortices every 0.01\u03c4 during n = 4 four cycles with\nd = 48\u03bb and nv = 0.052/\u03bb2. Most of the vortices are\nmoving while a small number of vortices remain pinned.\nIn Fig. 1(b) we illustrate the same system with the vortex\npositions marked once per cycle during n = 100 cycles.\nHere, all of the vortices return to their initial position\nat the end of each cycle, so all of the points marking\nthe position of an individual vortex coincide. This indicates that the system is undergoing a reversible flow.\nFor increasing d there is a transition to an irreversible\nflow state. In Fig. 1(c) we show the stroboscopic locations of the vortices in n = 25 cycles for the same system\nas in Fig. 1(a,b) but with d = 160\u03bb. In this case, the\nvortices do not return to their initial positions after each\ncycle. When the number of cycles increases, the vortices\ncontinue to move further from their starting point after\neach cycle. Figure 1(d) illustrates the anisotropic nature\nof the vortex displacements for the system in Fig. 1(c)\nduring n = 100 cycles.\nIn Fig. 2(a) we plot the cumulative mean squared displacements Rxd and Ryd versus drive cycle number for the\nsample in the irreversible regime shown in Fig. 1(c,d).\n\ny\n\ny\n\n(b)\n\nx\n\nFIG. 1: Black dots: Stroboscopic vortex positions marked\nevery 0.01\u03c4 in (a) and every \u03c4 in (b,c,d).

The vortices do not return\nto their initial positions and the behavior is irreversible. (d)\nThe same sample as (c) for n = 100 cycles showing that the\ndisplacements are anisotropic.\n\nThe dashed line fits indicate that the vortices are performing an anisotropic random walk similar to that found\nin the irreversible regime for the sheared colloidal system\nof Ref. [1]. By conducting a series of simulations in which\nwe vary d and nv , we can extract the effective diffusivities\nand determine the thresholds for the irreversible behavior.\nIn Fig. 3(a) we plot Dx and Dy versus d for a sample with fixed nv = 0.052/\u03bb2. There is a clear threshold\ndc = 80\u03bb marking the transition from reversible behavior\nwith Dx = Dy = 0 to irreversible behavior with nonzero\nDx and Dy . Above dc , Dx and Dy monotonically increase with d. Figure 3(b) shows Dx,y for fixed d = 96\u03bb\nand varied vortex density nv . There is a threshold density nv = 0.034/\u03bb2 below which the system is reversible\nand above which the behavior becomes irreversible. The\ndiffusivity passes through a peak as nv increases above\nthe threshold, while Dx and Dy decrease at higher values\nof nv when the increasing strength of the vortex-vortex\ninteractions leads to an effective caging effect. The inset\nof Fig. 3(d) illustrates the appearance of two additional\nphases at higher nv . For 0.3/\u03bb2 \u2264 nv < 0.36/\u03bb2, Dy = 0\nbut Dx remains finite, resulting in a smectic phase [6]\n\n\f3\n4\n\n10\n\n(a)\n\n1\n\n(b)\n\n-2\n\n-1\n0\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n3\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\nCycles\n\n4\nDy\n\n0\n\n0\n5\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\nd\n\n(c)\n\n300\n\nDx\n\n4\n3\n\nDy\n\n0\n\ndc\n0\n\n1\n\np\n\nF\n\n2\n\n3\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\nnv\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n0.25 0.3 0.35\nnv\n\n100\n\nDy\n\n1\n\n0.05\n\n(d)\n\n200\n\n2\n\n0\n\n1\n0\n\n500\n\nDx\n\n2\n\nDx, Dy\n\nDx, Dy\n\nDx, Dy\n\n6\n\n2\n\nDx, Dy\n\n3 (b)\n\n0\n\n0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25\n\nnv\n\nFIG. 3: Diffusivities Dx and Dy versus d for fixed nv =\n0.052/\u03bb2 .

For weak F p the system acts reversibly, since when F ext > F p , all the vortices depin\nand there is no local shear in the vortex lattice. In the\ncolloidal shearing experiments of Ref.

Irreversible behavior occurs for intermediate values of F p , as shown in Fig. 3(c) by the peak in Dx and\nDy at F p \u2248 1.5f0 . In Fig. 3(d) we plot dc , the threshold displacement per cycle required to induce irreversible\nbehavior, versus vortex density nv , showing that dc decreases with increasing nv . There is a divergence in dc\nnear the matching density nv = 0.0244/\u03bb2 where the\nnumber of vortices equals the number of pinning sites.\nIf Nv < Np , all the vortices are pinned and the system enters a reversible state. As Nv \u2192 Np from above,\nthe distance between nonpinned vortices diverges and the\nvortices must be driven over longer distances in order to\npermit the nonpinned vortices to interact with each other\nand produce the irreversible behavior.\nIn general, our results are in good agreement with the\nshear experiments of Ref. [1], where a threshold strain\nwhich decreases with increasing colloid density must be\napplied to produce irreversible motion. dc diverges as the\nthreshold is approached from above. Our results suggest\nthat if the colloidal experiment were performed at higher\ncolloid density than considered in Ref. [1], the diffusivity\nshould decrease dramatically and could drop to zero if a\njamming transition occurs. It may also be possible that\nthe colloidal motion will become banded, which would be\nanalogous to the smectic state.\nIn the shear experiments the transition from reversible\nto irreversible behavior can be visualized directly by\nvideo microscopy [1], while for most vortex systems, direct imaging of the vortex motion is difficult. A straightforward method for probing the nature of the vortex dy-\n\n\f4\nnamics is through voltage noise fluctuations, where the\nvoltage is proportional to the vortex velocity. In Fig. 4(a)\nwe plot Vx versus cycle number n for the same system\nshown in Fig. 1(a,b) in both the reversible and irreversible regimes. The velocities are sampled at a rate\nof 0.01\u03c4 . In Fig. 4(a), we see that Vx follows the square\nwave of the driving force and that the average Vx for\nthe two states is similar. We can superimpose the velocity curves in each cycle by plotting Vx versus t\u2032 , where\nt\u2032 = t \u2212 t mod \u03c4 , and compare the velocity fluctuations\nin the two regimes. In Fig. 4(c,d) we plot the superimposed fluctuations of Vx for 10 cycles in the reversible\nregime for the negative and positive portions of the cycle.\nHere, the fluctuations of Vx are nearly identical in each\ncycle, indicating that the vortices are flowing along the\nsame trajectories during each cycle. In the irreversible\nregime, shown in Fig. 4(e,f), the velocity fluctuations differ during each cycle and the curves do not overlap. We\nobserve a similar behavior for the fluctuations in the ydirection. Since the power spectrum of the fluctuations\ncan be measured readily in experiment [13], we compute\nR\n2\nS(f ) =\n|Vx (t)|e\u22122\u03c0if t dt . Fig. 2(b) shows that a\nbroad spectrum appears in the irreversible regime, while\nin the reversible regime the noise power is much lower\nand strong harmonic frequencies appear. These results\nshow that the reversible to irreversible transition can be\nidentified through noise measurements. A more direct\nvisualization experiment could be performed by periodically driving a two-dimensional colloid system interacting\nwith a random substrate [12] or optical traps [14].\nThe colloidal shearing experiments of Refs. [1, 3] found\nevidence of a dynamical phase transition into the irreversible state, along with an initial transient behavior of\na duration that diverges near the transition. We find a\nsimilar transient behavior in our system. If we consider\nDx and Dy in Fig. 2(a) as an order parameter, Fig. 4(b)\nshows that we find a reasonable scaling of Dx \u221d (d \u2212 dc )\u03b2\nwith \u03b2 = 0.59, consistent with either directed percolation\nin two dimensions [15] or conserved directed percolation.\nThe latter was recently proposed as the universality class\nof the colloidal shear experiments [16]. It would be interesting to determine whether a similar power law divergence occurs in the average displacements near the strain\nthreshold in the colloidal system.\nIn summary, we have shown with numerical simulations that a non-thermal transition from reversible to\nirreversible flow behavior occurs for periodically driven\nvortex systems in the presence of quenched disorder. The\ntransition is characterized by performing stroboscopic\nmeasurements of the vortex locations after each drive cycle. We find that there is a threshold in the displacement\nper cycle above which the system acts irreversibly. In the\nirreversible regime, the vortices undergo an anisotropic\nrandom walk. The threshold decreases as the vortex density increases. The transition can also be identified by\nanalyzing the voltage noise fluctuations during each cy-\n\ncle. Our results are remarkably similar to recent experimental observations of a transition to irreversible flow for\nsheared colloids. In the colloid system, the velocity dispersion created by the shearing process permits neighboring colloids to undergo different random displacements.\nIn the vortex system, the pinning sites create velocity\ndispersion by generating local shear in the vortex lattice.\nThe transition to the irreversible state is consistent with\neither two-dimensional directed percolation or conserved\ndirected percolation. Our results suggest that the behavior of the colloidal shear experiments may be general to\ndriven particle systems with quenched disorder.\nWe thank E. Ben-Naim, M. Hastings, and D.
