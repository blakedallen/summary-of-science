We report the current stage of the 86GHz VLBP monitoring program of OVV 1633+382. The monitoring\nprogram is still running and in this talk we will present the preliminary results of the first six epochs.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe 18mag QSO 1633+382 (4C38.41, z=1.807) showed a\nvery pronounced outburst in 2001/2002. With a peak amplitude of more than 9 Jy at 90GHz, this flare was brighter\nthan any known previous flare in this source (data available since 1980). During onset, the mm-flare was particulary fast, with an increase of more than 2 Jy at 230 GHz\nin less than 8 days. Since January 2002, the mm-flux of\n1633+382 is decaying. During this decline, however, local\nflux variations with amplitudes of 1-3 Jy were seen, indicative of underlying and more rapid source activity on\ntime scales of 1-2 months. After the main peak occurring\nin 2001.99, the 90 GHz flux showed secondary maxima\nat approximately half year intervals in 2002.3, 2002.7 and\n2003.13. This kind of periodicity might be explained via\nthe lighthouse model (Camenzind & Krockenberger 1992),\nwhich is based on the magnetic accelerator of Blanford &\nPayne (1982). At present the millimeter flux is nearly back\nto its quiescent level of 2-2.5 Jy, which the source had before the flare began. Our VLBA Polarimetry monitoring\nstarted June 2002 during the onset of the flare. At cm\nwavelength, the flare is only marginally detected which\nimplies very high opacity of the source.\n\n2. Observations and Calibration\nWe observed 1633+382 at 22, 43 & 86 GHz with the\nEffelsberg 100m telescope and the VLBA. At 86 GHz,\nhowever, due to the limited frequency switching capability of Effelsberg telescope, the source was observed only\nby the VLBA. The observations were conducted with 8\nchannels, 8 MHz bandwidth & 2 bit sampling configuration. The data were correlated at the VLBA correlator,\nSocorro, NM. For the amplitude and phase calibration,\nthe data were read to the AIPS package. Gain curve (GC)\ntables and Tsys (TY) tables were removed and reread.\nVLBA procedures were used for the calibrations (e.g.\nVLBAMPCL for manual phase calibration, VLBACPOL\nfor cross polarization phase calibration).\n\nTable 1.

At first, LL & RR data of all sources\n(1633+382 and the calibrators) were imaged separately\nand compared to check if any of them is circularly polarized (i. e. Homan & Wardle 1999).\nAfter the self-calibration in DIFMAP, the data were\nre-read in AIPS for the estimation of the instrumental\nleakage terms (Leppan\u0308en et al. 1995, G\u00f3mez et al. 2002).\nObviously, the D-terms could be only well-determined\nwhen the linear polarization (e.g. LR & RL) of the source\nis prominent (a few percent of fractional polarization).\nThe latest three of all six epochs, show well-determined\nand consistent D-terms (i.e. Fig. 1 & Fig. 2). Since we\nwere not able to apply pulse-cal. tone for phase calibration at 86GHz, there is still instrumental polarization angle offset in the data. EVPAs of the offset uncorrected\ndata are, however, in good agreement with the old cm\ndata (Cawthorne et al. 1993) and the new sub-mm data\n(Siringo et al. 2004).\nFurther EVPA test results of the calibration sources\nat 3mm and the EVPA at 7mm/1.3cm will be shown. It\nis still unclear why the level of cross polarization of the\nfirst three epochs (Jun. 2002 - Nov. 2002) was much lower\n\n\f86\n\nB.W.
