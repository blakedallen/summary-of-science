States with both positive\nand negative parity are isolated via a parity projection method. The extent to which spin projection is needed\nis examined. The gross features of the splittings from the nucleon ground state show a trend consistent with\nexperimental results at the quark masses explored.\n\n1. Introduction\nLattice QCD plays an important role in understanding the N* spectrum. One can systematically study the spectrum sector by sector, with\nthe ability to dial the quark masses, and dissect\nthe degrees of freedom. The rich structure of the\nexcited baryon spectrum, as tabulated by the particle data group [1], provides a fertile ground for\nexploring how the internal degrees of freedom in\nthe nucleon are excited and how QCD works in\na wider context. One outstanding example is the\nparity splitting pattern in the low-lying N* spectrum. The splittings are a direct manifestation of\nspontaneous chiral symmetry breaking of QCD.\nWithout it, QCD predicts parity doubling in the\nbaryon spectrum. The experimental effort on excited baryons has intensified in recent years at\nJLab and other accelerators, generating renewed\ndebate on how well these states are known. The\nstar-rating system on the observed states is a reflection of the current situation.\nGiven that state-of-the-art lattice QCD simulations have produced a ground-state spectrum that\nis very close to the observed values [2], it is important to extend the success beyond the ground\nstates. There exist already a number of lattice\nstudies of the N* spectrum [3\u20138], focusing mostly\non the spin-1/2 sector. All established a clear\nsplitting from the ground state. In this study, we\n\nexplore the possibility of calculating the excited\nbaryon states in the spin-3/2 sector with isospin\n1/2.\n2. Method\nWe consider the following interpolating\n\u0010 \u0011field\n1 3+\nP\n[9,\nwith the quantum numbers I(J ) = 2 2\n10],\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0001\n1\n\u03c7\u03bc = \u01ebabc uTa C\u03b35 \u03b3\u03c1 db g \u03bc\u03c1 \u2212 \u03b3 \u03bc \u03b3 \u03c1 \u03b35 uc . (1)\n4\nDespite having an explicit parity by construction,\nthe interpolating field couples to both positive\nand negative parity states. A parity projection\nis needed to separate the two. In the large Euclidean time limit, the correlator with Dirichlet\nboundary condition in the time direction and zero\nspatial momentum becomes\nX\n(2)\nG\u03bc\u03bd (t) =\n< 0|\u03c7\u03bc (x) \u03c7\u03bd (0)|0 >\nx\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03b34 + 1 \u2212M+ t\n\u2212\u03b34 + 1 \u2212M\u2212 t\n= f\u03bc\u03bd \u03bb2+\n(3)\ne\n+ \u03bb2\u2212\ne\n2\n2\nwhere f\u03bc\u03bd is a function common to both terms.\nThe relative sign in front of \u03b34 provides the solution: by taking the trace of G\u03bc\u03bd (t) with (1\u00b1\u03b34 )/4,\none can isolate M+ and M\u2212 , respectively.\n\n\f2\nIt is well-known that a spin-3/2 interpolating\nfield couples to both spin-3/2 and spin-1/2 states.\nA spin projection can be used to isolate the individual contributions in the correlation function\nG\u03bc\u03bd . Using the spin-3/2 projection operator [11],\n1\n1\n3/2\nP\u03bc\u03bd\n= g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u03b3\u03bc \u03b3\u03bd \u2212 2 (\u03b3 *p\u03b3\u03bc p\u03bd +p\u03bc \u03b3\u03bd \u03b3 *p)(4)\n3\n3p\nthe spin-3/2 part can be projected out by\nG3/2\n\u03bc\u03bd (t) =\n\n4\nX\n\n3/2\n\nG\u03bc\u03bb (t)P\u03bb\u03bd ,\n\n(5)\n\n\u03bb=1\n\nwhile the spin-1/2 part by\nG1/2\n\u03bc\u03bd (t) =\n\n4\nX\n\n3/2\n\nG\u03bc\u03bb (t)(1 \u2212 P\u03bb\u03bd ).\n\n(6)\n\n\u03bb=1\n\nObviously, they satisfy the relation\n3/2\nG\u03bc\u03bd (t) = G1/2\n\u03bc\u03bd (t) + G\u03bc\u03bd (t).\n\n(7)\n\nThe anisotropic gauge action of [12], and\nthe anisotropic D234 quark action of [13] are\nused. Both have tadpole-improved tree-level coefficients. A 103 \u00d7 30 lattice with as \u2248 0.24 fm\nand anisotropy \u03be = as /at = 3 is used. In all,\n100 configurations are analyzed. On each configuration 9 quark propagators are computed using\na multi-mass solver, with quark masses ranging\nfrom approximately 780 to 90 MeV. The corresponding mass ratio \u03c0/\u03c1 is from 0.95 to 0.65. A\ngauge-invariant gaussian-smeared source is used.\nThe source is located at (x, y, z, t) = (2, 2, 2, 2).\nFigure 1 presents results for the correlation\nfunction in the positive-parity nucleon channel at\nthe smallest quark mass considered. Spin projection reveals two different exponentials from\nthe spin-3/2 and spin-1/2 parts, with the spin3/2 state being heavier than the spin-1/2 one (a\nsteeper fall-off), in agreement with the ordering\nin experiment. The expected relation in Eq. (7)\nis indeed satisfied numerically, providing a nontrivial check of the calculation. A further check\nof the calculation is provided by the fact that\n1/2\nthe mass extracted from G\u03bc\u03bd (t) is degenerate\nwith that from the conventional G(t) for the nucleon ground state \u0001using the interpolating field\n\u03c7 = \u01ebabc uTa C\u03b35 db uc . One would get a false\n\nsignal from the dominant spin-1/2 state without\nspin projection. The large error bars indicate sensitive cancellations in the projection procedure.\nFigure 2 shows the similar plot in the negativeparity nucleon channel. Here the relation in\nEq. (7) is also satisfied, even though the signal\nis dominated by the 3/2\u2212 state. The results\nalso show a similar mass for the 1/2\u2212 state and\nthe 3/2\u2212 state, in accord with the experimental\n\u2212\n\u2212\nstates of N \u2217 (1535) 21 and N \u2217 (1520) 23 which are\nclose to each other.\nFigure 3 presents results for the mass ratio\nextracted from the correlation functions for the\nN \u2217 (3/2+ ) state to the nucleon ground state as a\nfunction of the mass ratio (\u03c0/\u03c1)2 . Mass ratios\nhave minimal dependence on the uncertainties in\ndetermining the scale and the quark masses, so\nthat a more reliable comparison with experiment\ncan be made. Figure 4 shows the similar plot for\nthe N \u2217 (3/2\u2212) state. These ratios appear headed\nin the right direction compared to experiment.\n3. Conclusion\nWe have obtained clear signals for spin-3/2 N*\nstates on an anisotropic lattice with smeared operators and 100 configurations. States of both\nnegative- and positive-parity are isolated with a\nparity projection technique. The need for spin\nprojection is further demonstrated. The results\nfor the pattern of the splittings appears consistent with experiment, but more study is needed\nto address systematic errors.\n4.
