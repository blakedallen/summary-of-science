By numerically solving the coupled GrossPitaevskii and Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations, we study the phase transition from the uniform\nstate to the symmetry-breaking state characterized by a bright-soliton condensate and a localized\nthermal cloud.

Remarkably, the presence of the stable localized state strongly increases the critical\ntemperature of Bose-Einstein condensation.\nPACS Numbers: 03.75.Kk\n\nIn recent experiments a repulsive Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) has been produced and studied in a quasi\none-dimensional (1D) ring [1,2]. These experiments and\nalso previous experimental investigations with cold atoms\nin torodial traps [3] are important steps to achieve ultrahigh precision sensors with atom interferometry (see for\ninstance [4]). The case of an attractive BEC in a ring\nhas not yet been experimentally investigated but appears very interesting: a quantum phase transition from\nan azimuthally uniform condensate to a bright soliton\nhas been predicted [5,6]. Dynamically stable multi-peak\nbright solitons may also appear [7].\nIn this paper we investigate the effect of temperature on the uniform-to-localized phase transition by solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) of the macroscopic wave function of the Bose condensate and the\nBogoliubov-de Gennes equations for the quantum depletion and the thermal cloud. We show that, for a fixed\nnumber N of atoms, the uniform solution always exists\nbut it is thermodynamically stable only up to a critical\ninteraction strength which depends on the temperature.\nAbove this critical interaction strength both condensate\nand thermal cloud become localized. In addition, we determine the finite-temperature phase-diagram of the system for a sample of alkali-metal atoms in a ring. Our\nresults are relevant not only for the physics of cold atoms\nbut also for the nonlinear science of solitons. In fact, a\nmixture of condensed and non condensed attractive particles [8] correspond to incoherent solitons of light in Kerr\nmedia [9].\nWe consider a Bose gas with negative scattering length\n(as < 0) confined in a toroidal potential and model\nthe transverse confinement with a harmonic potential\nof frequency \u03c9\u22a5 . The two characteristic lengths of the\ntoroidal trap are the azimuthal radius R and the transverse harmonic length a\u22a5 = (h\u0304/(m\u03c9\u22a5 ))1/2 . To avoid the\nconfinement-induced resonance at |as | \u2243 a\u22a5 [10] we impose that |as | \u226a a\u22a5 [11]. At low temperature T and with\n\na finite number N of atoms, in the Bose gas there is the\nthermal cloud but also the BEC. Under the condition\nR \u226b a\u22a5 the azimuthal wavefunction \u03c6(z) of the BEC\nin the ring satisfies the 1D non-polynomial Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation (NPSE) [7,12]\n\u0014\n\u0015\nh\u03042 2\n\u2212\n\u2202z + \u03bc(n0 (z)) \u03c6(z) = \u03bc\u0304 \u03c6(z) ,\n(1)\n2m\nwhere z = R\u03b8 is the azimuthal coordinate with \u03b8 the\nazimuthal angle. This equation has been deduced from\nthe 3D GPE by using a Gaussian transverse wave function with a density-dependent width and neglecting curvature effects [7,12]. The non-polynomial term \u03bc(n0 (z))\nis a function of the BEC density n0 (z) = N0 |\u03c6(z)|2 and it\nis given by \u03bc = \u2202E/\u2202n0 , where E = h\u0304\u03c9\u22a5 n0 (1+2as n0 )1/2\nand as < 0 is the 3D s-wave scattering length [7]. The\nwave function \u03c6(z) is normalized to one and satisfies the\ncondition of periodicity \u03c6(z +L) = \u03c6(z), where L = 2\u03c0R.\nThe chemical\nR potential \u03bc\u0304 is fixed by the normalization\ncondition |\u03c6(z)|2 dz = 1. Quantum and thermal depletions of the BEC are obtained by solving the Bogoliubovde Gennes (BdG) equations [13] for the quasi-particle\namplitudes u\u03b1 (z) and v\u03b1 (z), given by\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\nu\u03b1 (z)\nu\u03b1 (z)\nL\n,\n(2)\n= \u01eb\u03b1\nv\u03b1 (z)\nv\u03b1 (z)\nwhere \u01eb\u03b1 are the energies of quasi-particle excitations and\nthe operator L is\n!\nh\u03042 2\n0 \u03bc)\n2 \u2202\u03bc\n\u2212 2m\n\u2202z \u2212 \u03bc\u0304 + \u2202(n\nN\n\u03c6\n0\n\u2202n0\n\u2202n0\nL=\n.

The numerical procedure is discussed in\n[15]. In our approach the transverse excitations do not\ncontribute to the thermodynamics: this assumption is\nreasonable only if the system is quasi-1D.\n\nBoltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature\nof the thermal cloud. The number \u00d1 of non-condensed\natoms\nis thus given by R\u00d1 = Nout + NT , where Nout =\nR\nnout (z)dz and NT = nT (z)dz. In the weak-coupling\nlimit, where as n0 \u226a 1, the energy density E becomes\nE = h\u0304\u03c9\u22a5 n0 + h\u0304\u03c9\u22a5 as n20 , the NPSE (1) reduces to the familiar 1D GPE [7] and the BdG equations (2,3) reduce\nto the BdG equations of the strictly 1D problem. Note\nthat the Eqs. (1) and (2,3) could be improved by taking\ninto account Popov and Beliaev corrections, which are\nusually not negligible only when the condensed fraction\nis very small [14].\nIn our approach, by fixing the total number N =\nN0 + \u00d1 of atoms and the temperature T , the equilibrium configurations are found from the Helmholtz free\nenergy [13]\nF = E0 + \u1ebc + \u03bc\u0304(N \u2212 N0 ) \u2212 T S ,\n\n(a)\n\n\u22120.005\n\u22120.015\nkBT=1\n\u22120.025\n\u22120.02\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\nF/N\n\n(b)\n\u22120.03\nkBT=2\n\u22120.04\n\u22120.07\n\n(4)\n\nwhere\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n(c)\n\n\u22120.08\n\nE0 = N0\n\nZ \u0014\n\n2\n\n\u0015\nh\u0304 \u2217\n2\n\u03c6 (z)\u2202z \u03c6(z) + E(n0 (z)) dz\n\u2212\n2m\n\nkBT=4\n\n(5)\n\n\u22120.09\n\nis the BEC energy.

We choose N = 104 atoms and a toroidal\ngeometry with L/a\u22a5 = 100. While the uniform solution\n(dashed line) exists for any strength \u03b3, the localized solution (solid line) exists only above a critical strength \u03b3e .\nAs expected, at T \u2243 0 we find \u03b3c \u2243 \u03c0 2 a\u22a5 /L = 0.0987.\nFor a given \u03b3 (\u03b3 > \u03b3e ) there are two localized states:\none is thermodynamically stable (lower solid line) and\nthe other is metastable (upper solid line). The metastability is guaranteed by the Bogoliubov eigenvalues being\nreal. At very-low temperature, see panel (a) of Fig. 1,\nfor \u03b3 > \u03b3e the solid line of the metastable localized solution is very close to the dashed line of the metastable\nuniform solution. At higher temperature, see panels (b)\nand (c) of Fig. 1, the free energy of the metastable localized solution, but also the free energy of the stable one\nat small \u03b3 > \u03b3e , is higher than the free energy of the uniform solution. The strength \u03b3c at which the dashed line\ncrosses the lower solid line determines the point where the\nfirst-order transition takes place. At T \u2243 0 we find that\n\u03b3c \u2243 \u03b3e . The strength \u03b3c grows with the temperature T\nbut in general \u03b3c does not coincide with the strength \u03b3e at\nwhich the localized solutions appear. Thus, at finite temperature, for 0 < \u03b3 < \u03b3e there is only the stable uniform\n\nThe solution of the 1D GPE with periodic boundary\nconditions is known analytically [5]: it is uniform for\n0 < \u03b3N0 < \u03c0 2 a\u22a5 /L, with \u03b3 = 2|as |/a\u22a5 the interatomic\nstrength, and becomes localized for \u03b3N0 > \u03c0 2 a\u22a5 /L. By\nusing the NPSE we find that the transition strength approaches the 1D GPE one for large L [7]. The main\ndifference between 1D GPE and NPSE is that the NPSE\ncorrectly gives the collapse of the localized solution for\n\u03b3N0 > 4/3, while the 1D GPE does not predict collapse [7]. It is important to observe that the uniformto-localized transition depends on N0 and only implicitly\non N = N0 + Nout + NT . We shall show that, for a fixed\nnumber N of atoms, the uniform solution exists for any\nvalue of the interatomic strength \u03b3 but it is thermodynamically stable only below a critical strength \u03b3c . Above\n\u03b3c the stable state is a localized solution that minimizes\nthe free energy.\nThe BdG equations\n\u221a (2,3) are easily solved if \u03c6(z) is\nuniform: \u03c6(z) = 1/ L. In this case the quasi-particle\namplitudes uk (z) = \u016bk eikz and vk (z) = v\u0304k e\u2212ikz are plane\nwaves and the wave vector k is quantized: k = (2\u03c0/L)j,\nwith j an integer number. When \u03c6(z) is not uniform,\none must numerically solve Eq. (1) and Eqs. (2,3). We\nuse a finite-difference space discretization and diagonalize\nthe matrix associated to the operator L of Eq. (3). In\n2\n\n\fstate; for \u03b3e < \u03b3 < \u03b3c there are two metastable localized\nstates and the stable uniform state; for \u03b3 > \u03b3c the stable state is one of the two localized state while the other\nlocalized state and the uniform state are metastable.\n\nbut the true collapse is avoided by populating the out-ofcondensate cloud with \u00d1 = N \u2212 N0 atoms for N \u03b3 > 4/3.\nWe have verified that in the stable localized state the\nnumber N0 of condensed atoms is always very close to\nthe collapse value 4/(3\u03b3) and, for a fixed \u03b3, the number\nN0 has a very small temperature dependence. It follows\nthat one can estimate the condensed fraction of the stable localized state as N0 /N \u2243 4/(3N \u03b3). This estimation\nis not so rough: choosing for instance N \u03b3 = 2 one finds\nN0 /N \u2243 2/3 in good agreement with the result shown in\nthe upper solid line of Fig. 2 (see where N0 /N = 0.66).\nIn the previous calculations, transverse modes have\nbeen neglected and the thermally excited quasi-particles\nare allowed to populate only the lowest transverse state.\nThis assumption can be justified by a simple argument:\nIn the weakly localized regime (low N \u03b3) the spectrum\nof elementary excitations is well approximated by the\nfree Bose gas, where the logitudinal modes have energies\nO(h\u0304\u03c9\u22a5 a2\u22a5 /L2 ) much lower than the O(h\u0304\u03c9\u22a5 ) transverse\nmodes. In this limit we have explicitly verified that, with\nthe chosen parameters (L/a\u22a5 = 100), for kB T <\n\u223c 5 h\u0304\u03c9\u22a5\nthe number of quasiparticles in the excited transverse\nmodes is indeed negligible. In the strongly localized region, both longitudinal and transverse low energy excitations are known in the large L limit [6,17], where a finite\nO(h\u0304\u03c9\u22a5 ) gap separates the two branches. Moreover, our\ncalculations show that for N \u03b3 < 4/3, thermal depletion\ndoes not affect deeply the thermodynamics of the model\nup to the transition temperature.\n\n1\n(a)\n\n0.75\n0.5\n\nkBT=1\n\n0.25\n0\n1\n\n0\n\n0.4\n\n0.8\n\n1.2\n\n1.6\n\n2\n(b)\n\n0.75\nN0/N\n\n2.4\n\n0.5\nkBT=2\n\n0.25\n0\n1\n\n0\n\n0.4\n\n0.8\n\n1.2\n\n1.6\n\n2\n\n2.4\n(c)\n\n0.75\n0.5\n\nkBT=4\n\n0.25\n0\n\n0\n\n0.4\n\n0.8\n\n1.2\nN\u03b3\n\n1.6\n\n2\n\n2.4\n\nFIG. 2 Condensate fraction N0 /N as a function of the\nscaled interatomic strength \u03b3 = 2|as |/a\u22a5 for N = 104\natoms with L/a\u22a5 = 100.

At low temperature, see panel (a) of Fig.\n2, the uniform state (dashed line) is a quasi-pure BEC\nfor 0 < \u03b3 < \u03b3e . For \u03b3 > \u03b3e the condensate fraction of the\nuniform state quickly decreases. At low temperature the\nuniform-to-localized phase transition does not produce\na relevant quantum depletion Nout /N at the transition\npoint. This result is obtained with a fixed number of\natoms (N = 104 ). We have verified that by fixing N0 instead of N (as done in [5]) the condensate fraction N0 /N\ngoes to zero for \u03b3N0 \u2243 \u03c0 2 a\u22a5 /L.\nAt higher temperature, see panels (b) and (c) of Fig.\n2, BEC and non-condensate component coexist also in\nthe uniform state. Fig. 2 shows that the condensate\nfraction of the localized states is higher than the condensate fraction of the uniform state. Remarkably, at\nthe transition strength \u03b3c there is a sizeable jump in the\ncondensate fraction. Moreover, for the stable localized\nstate the ratio N0 /N initially grows by increasing the\ninteratomic strength.

Length z is in units of\na\u22a5 = (h\u0304/(m\u03c9\u22a5 ))1/2 .\nFor completeness, we have repeated the calculations by\nusing the 1D GPE. Also in this case we have found two\nlocalized solutions but the stable one always maintains\na condensate fraction close to one, due to the fact that\nthe 1D GPE does not predict the collapse. Thus the\n3\n\n\fthat our predictions can be verified by using a magnetic ring with geometric parameters not too far from\nthose used in Ref. [1] for trapping a repulsive condensate of 87 Rb atoms. For instance, a sample of 7 Li atoms,\nwhich have a negative scattering length (as = \u22121.4 nm),\ncan be trapped in a ring with transverse width a\u22a5 \u2243 6\n\u03bcm, which gives h\u0304\u03c9\u22a5 /kB = h\u03042 /(2a2\u22a5 ) \u2243 2 nK. In this\nway, having N = 104 atoms the interaction strength is\nN \u03b3 = N 2|as |/a\u22a5 \u2243 5. Then, by taking the azimuthal\nradius R = L/(2\u03c0) \u2243 100 \u03bcm one can test the predictions of Fig. 4 varying the temperature or tuning the\nscattering length as around a Feshbach resonance.\n\ntransverse structure of the soliton, taken into account by\nthe NPSE, strongly modifies the thermodynamics of the\nattractive Bose gas.\nIn Fig. 3 we plot the density profile n0 (z) of the condensate cloud (solid line) and of the density profile nT (z)\nof the thermal cloud (dot-dashed line) for the stable localized state and two values of \u03b3. We have verified that the\ndensity profile nout (z) of the quantum depletion reduces\nby increasing the temperature T and that the quantum\ndepletion Nout /N becomes relevant only when the kB T\nis of the order of the lowest Bogoliubov energy level.\nThis energy can be easily estimated as kB T /(h\u0304\u03c9\u22a5 ) =\n(h\u03042 /(2m))(2\u03c0/L)2 /(h\u0304\u03c9\u22a5 ) = 2\u03c0 2 a2\u22a5 /L2 \u2243 0.002.\n14\n12\n\nkBT\n\n10\n\nNO BEC\n\n[1] S.

Phase diagram in the plane temperature T vs interatomic strength \u03b3 for N = 104 atoms\nin a toroidal trap, with L = 100. The energy kB T is in\nunits of h\u0304\u03c9\u22a5 and the length in units of a\u22a5 .\nIn Fig. 4 we plot the phase diagram of the atomic\ncloud of bosons in the plane (N \u03b3, T ) for L/a\u22a5 = 100\nand N = 104 . In the figure we insert a dashed line\nat kB T /(h\u0304\u03c9\u22a5 ) = 6.01, which is the transition temperature TBEC of the Bose-Einstein condensation above\nwhich the condensate fraction of the uniform state is zero.\nThe transition temperature TBEC reduces by increasing\nL/a\u22a5 . In fact, it is easy to show [16] that kB TBEC /(h\u0304\u03c9\u22a5 )\nscales as N a2\u22a5 /L2 . Fig. 4 displays as a solid line the curve\nof the uniform-to-localized transition. Remarkably, the\nBEC transition temperature of the localized solution is\nmuch larger than the uniform one. Fig. 4 shows that\nwith N \u03b3 > 0.68, there is a first order transition from\nlocalized BEC phase to the the uniform thermal phase\nwithout BEC. Instead, for N \u03b3 < 0.68 the no-BEC phase\nis obtained starting from the uniform phase by increasing\nthe temperature.\nIn conclusion, we have shown that an attractive Bose\ncondensate in a quasi one-dimensional toroidal trap displays at finite temperature new and intersting features,\nlike the coexistence of a coherent self-bound bright soliton with a thermal cloud, the avoiding of true collapse\nvia population of the out-of-condensate (thermal) component, and the enhancement of the Bose-Einstein transition temperature for the localized solution.
