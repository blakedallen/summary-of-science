A further strength of the methods is that the\naccuracy of the reconstructed states can be rigorously certified without any a priori assumptions.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOne of the principal features distinguishing classical\nfrom quantum many-body systems is that quantum systems require exponentially many parameters in the system size to fully specify the state, compared to only linearly many for classical systems. Put to use constructively, the exponential complexity enables the construction of information processing devices fundamentally superior to any classical device. At the same time, however, this \"curse of dimensionality\" makes engineering\ntasks-such as verifying that the quantum processing device functions as intended-a daunting challenge.\nThe full determination of the quantum state of a system, known as quantum state tomography [1], has already been achieved by measuring a complete set of observables whose expectation values determine the quantum state [2\u20137]. As it is typically formulated [8], simply\nto output an estimate for a generic state would take exponential time in the system size N , given that there are\nan exponential number of coefficients in a generic state's\ndescription. This is but one of several inefficiencies. Most\nquantum states have exponentially small amplitudes in\nalmost every basis, so to distinguish any one of those amplitudes from zero, one must take an exponential number\n\nof samples. Assuming one were able to collect all the data\nfrom an informationally complete measurement, one is\nleft with the intractable computational task of inverting\nthe measured frequencies to find an estimate of the state.\nHowever, the traditional representation of quantum\nstates is in a sense too general. Indeed, states which occur in many practical situations are specified by a small\nnumber of parameters. An efficient description could be\na practical preparation scheme which outputs the state;\nor, in the case of thermodynamical equilibrium states, a\nlocal Hamiltonian and a temperature. This insight is not\nnew: researchers in many-body physics and quantum information theory have found many classes of states which\nare described by a number of parameters scaling polynomially in N [9\u201313] and which closely approximate the\nkind of states found in physical systems [14, 15]. However, the question of whether these restricted classes can\nbe put to use in the context of tomography has remained\nlargely open.\nIn this work, we address the above challenge. The\nphysical system we have in mind is one where the constituents are arranged in a one-dimensional configuration (e.g., ions in a linear trap [3]). But the methods\nthat we are presenting here can be generalized to higherdimensional arrangements such as those realized in optical lattices [16]. It is highly plausible that in such a set-\n\n\f2\nting, correlations between neighboring particles are much\nmore pronounced (due to direct interaction) than correlations between distant systems (mediated e.g. by global\nfluctuations of control fields). An efficiently describable\nclass of states anticipating exactly this behavior has long\nbeen studied under the names of finitely correlated states\n(FCS) or matrix product states (MPS) [9, 10]. Importantly, restricting to this class is not a limitation since\nevery state may be written as a MPS with a suitable, albeit possibly large, matrix dimension. Since many states\nthat are relevant for quantum information processing or\nquantum many-body physics have a small (independent\nof N ) bond dimension, our methods are directly applicable to such states; examples include, but are not limited\nto, ground and thermal states, the GHZ, W, cluster, and\nAKLT states, the latter two being universal resources\nstates for quantum computing.\nGiven that standard tomography is no longer feasible\nin a range of recent and upcoming experiments involving\nlarge numbers of qubits, our results represent a significant advance in the ability to verify and quantitatively\nand efficiently benchmark systems of experimental importance.\n\nII.\n\nRESULTS\n\nIn the following we present two schemes for identifying systems that are well approximated by an MPS, initially focusing on pure states for simplicity. We will view\neach system as consisting of a linear chain of N qudits,\neach having dimension d. Both schemes require the measurement of linearly (in the system size N ) many local\nobservables within finite accuracy, polynomial classical\npost-processing of the data and can certify the accuracy\nof the reconstructed state without making any technical\nassumptions about the state in the laboratory. The first\nscheme requires unitary control and local measurements\nwhile the second scheme removes the need for unitary\ncontrol at the cost of more elaborate post-processing.\n\nA.\n\nScheme based on unitary transformations\n\nThe key idea of the method consists of a sequential\nprocedure to disentangle the left hand side of the chain\nfrom the right hand side, using a sequence of unitary\noperations with small interaction length independent of\nN . The result will be a product state and a sequence\nof local unitary operations from which to construct the\noriginal state.\nSuppose the ideal state in the laboratory is %\u0302 = |\u03c6ih\u03c6|,\nwhich we assume for clarity is a MPS of given bond dimension. This implies that the rank of reductions to\none part of a bipartite (left vs. right) split of the chain\nis bounded by a constant R. The protocol starts by\nestimating, through standard state tomography, the reduced density matrix of the first \u03ba = dlogd (R)e + 1 sites,\n\nFIG. 1.\nQuantum circuit that transforms |\u03c6i into\n|0i\u2297N \u2212\u03ba+1 \u2297 |\u03b7i with \u03ba = 3. The unitaries \u00dbi successively\ndisentangle the particles and the state |\u03b7i on the last sites\nacts as a boundary condition to determine the MPS description of |\u03c6i.\n\n\u03c3\u0302 \u2248 tr\u03ba+1,...,N [%\u0302]. This reduced density matrix has the\nPR\neigendecomposition \u03c3\u0302 = r=1 \u03c3r |\u03c6r ih\u03c6r | where the rank\nR \u2264 d\u03ba\u22121 . Hence there exists a density matrix with one\nfewer qudit that has the same rank R and eigenvalues \u03c3r\nas \u03c3\u0302. Therefore we can disentangle the first site in \u03c3\u0302 with\nthe following unitary acting on the first \u03ba sites:\n\u03ba\u22121\n\n\u00db =\n\n\u22121\nd\u22121 d X\nX\ns=0\n\ns0 =0\n\n|si1 \u2297 |s0 i2,...,\u03ba h\u03c6sd\u03ba\u22121 +s0 +1 |1,...,\u03ba ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere |\u03c61 i, . . . , |\u03c6R i have been extended in some arbitrary way to get a complete basis for sites 1, . . . , \u03ba. Applying \u00db produces the state \u00db |\u03c6i = |0i1 \u2297|vi2,...,N , where\n|vi is some pure state on sites 2, . . . , N . Hence \u00db disentangles the first qudit from all the others. Now, set aside\nthis first qudit, look at sites 2, . . . , \u03ba + 1, and repeat the\nabove process as indicated on Fig. 1. In this way, one obtains a sequence of unitaries \u00db1 , . . . , \u00dbN \u2212\u03ba+1 , where each\n\u00dbi acts on sites i, . . . , i + \u03ba \u2212 1. This sequence transforms\n|\u03c6i into \u00dbN \u2212\u03ba+1 * * * \u00db1 |\u03c6i = |0i\u2297N \u2212\u03ba+1 \u2297 |\u03b7i, where |\u03b7i\nis some pure state on the last \u03ba \u2212 1 sites.\nIn summary, this scheme infers the quantum circuit\nused to prepare an MPS [17]. The MPS decomposition of\n|\u03c6i can then be obtained readily from the Ui and |\u03b7i [18].\nIf the state in the laboratory %\u0302 is arbitrary, then the\nreduced density matrices \u03c3\u0302 will generally have full rank.\nHence in each step we will need to truncate the \u03ba qudit\nstate \u03c3\u0302 to a rank R subspace with R < d\u03ba\u22121 . Then the\nabove method will produce an MPS approximation to %\u0302.\nThe accuracy of this estimate can be certified, without\nany assumptions on the state, by keeping track of the\neffects of truncating each of the reduced states \u03c3\u0302. As\nshown in the Methods, errors of magnitude \u000f due to finite\nmeasurement precision or truncation error (as measured\n\n\f3\nby the weight of the truncated space) accumulate at most\nlinearly with the number of sites, and can be evaluated\ndirectly from the data, leading to an estimate of accuracy\nN \u000f.\nThe present scheme requires unitary control of \u03ba neighboring qudits, which is challenging to implement in many\ncurrent experimental settings. We now present a second\nscheme that avoids unitary control and requires only local measurements.\n\nB.\n\nScheme based on local measurements:\nCertification of estimated state\n\nConsider again the state %\u0302 in the laboratory and suppose that a tomographically-complete set of local measurements on all groups of k neighbouring qubits has\nbeen performed. Further suppose that sufficient data has\nbeen taken to yield estimates \u03c3\u0302i of the local reductions\n%\u0302i = tr1,...,i;i+k+1,...,N [%\u0302] such that\nk%\u0302i \u2212 \u03c3\u0302i ktr \u2264 \u000fi .\n\n(2)\n\nDetermining these approximate reduced density operators \u03c3\u0302i completes the experimental work. In the remainder we describe the classical post-processing that will result in a MPS estimate |\u03c8i to %\u0302 and a lower bound to the\nfidelity h\u03c8|%\u0302|\u03c8i [19] that does not require assumptions on\nthe nature of the state %\u0302.\nWe start with the latter, since the following easy\ncalculation yields the fidelity bound we have in mind\nand hints at the MPS estimate we are after. Suppose,\nfor the sake of the argument, that |\u03c8i is the unique\nground state (with energy zero) of a local Hamiltonian\nP\n\u0124 = i \u0125i , where the \u0125i is a projection operator acting only on sites i + 1, . . . , i + k (as it turns out, generic\nMPS are of this type). Then, expanding in the eigenbasis\nP2N \u22121\n\u0124 = n=0 En |En ihEn |,\ntr[\u0124 %\u0302] \u2265 \u2206E\n\nX\n\nn>0\n\nhEn |%\u0302|En i = \u2206E(1 \u2212 h\u03c8|%\u0302|\u03c8i),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere we denoted by \u2206E the energy gap above the\nground state |\u03c8i. Hence, we have the fidelity bound\nP\n\u0011\ntr[hi \u03c1\u0302]\n1 \u0010X\nh\u03c8|%\u0302|\u03c8i \u2265 1 \u2212 i\n\u22651\u2212\ntr[\u0125i \u03c3\u0302i ] + \u000fi .\n\u2206E\n\u2206E\ni\n(4)\nIn other words, the Hamiltonian acts as a witness for its\nground state |\u03c8i. This bound is tight: suppose the experimental estimates \u03c3\u0302i and the reductions of the state\nin the laboratory %\u0302i coincide, that is \u000fi = 0. If, in addition, the reductions of |\u03c8i match the \u03c3\u0302i then, as |\u03c8i was\nassumed to be the unique ground state with energy zero\nP\nP\nof i \u0125i , we have i tr[\u0125i \u03c3\u0302i ] = 0, i.e., h\u03c8|%\u0302|\u03c8i = 1.\nThe goal is now clear: find a local gapped Hamiltonian \u0124 such that the reductions of its ground state are\n\nclose to the \u03c3\u0302i . A priori it is unclear whether such a convenient witness always exists and how it could be found\nefficiently. However, using formal methods, one can show\nthat if the true state %\u0302 is close to a generic MPS, then\nsuch a witness Hamiltonian always exists [10]. What is\nmore, it can be constructed from the estimate of the algorithm sketched below. Its properties, chief among them\nthe gap, are efficiently computable. In the Methods section, we detail the efficient computation of these quantities, and we also consider how to treat states such as\nthe GHZ for which local marginals alone are not quite\nsufficient for complete characterization (they violate our\n\"generic\" condition).\n\nC.\n\nAn illustrative example\n\nWe illustrate how our certification procedure operates\nif our estimate for the state %\u0302 is a linear cluster state\n[20]. The cluster state is defined as the unique eigenstate\n(with eigenvalue +1) of stabilizers K\u0302i = \u1e90i\u22121 X\u0302i \u1e90i+1\nfor all i = 2, . . . , N \u2212 1 (together with boundary terms\nX\u03021 \u1e902 and \u1e90N \u22121 X\u0302N , which we do not treat separately for\nsimplicity). Assume that we have performed standard\nquantum state tomography on sets of three neighbouring spins, k = 3, which is the smallest useful set because\nin a cluster state the rank of the reduced density matrices of contiguous blocks is upper bounded by R = 4.\nLet us now assume that on the basis of these data, our\nprocedure suggests that the linear cluster state is indeed\nour estimate. The local Hamiltonian in this case is given\nP\nby \u0124 = i (1 \u2212 K\u0302i )/2, where the (1 \u2212 K\u0302i )/2 = \u0125i are\nprojectors, \u0124 has the cluster state as its unique ground\nstate (with energy zero) and an energy gap \u2206E = 1. The\nfidelity between the cluster state |\u03c8CS i and the state %\u0302 is\nP\nbounded by h\u03c8CS |%\u0302|\u03c8CS i = 1 \u2212 i (tr[\u0125i \u03c3\u0302i ] + \u000fi ), where\n\u000fi from Eq. (3) quantifies the statistical and experimental error in the local experimental estimates, and tr[\u0125i \u03c3\u0302i ]\nquantifies how much the laboratory state %\u0302 deviates from\nan exact cluster state.\nTomography on a cluster state can also be performed\nwith the scheme based on unitary transformations. A\ncluster state is the output of a quantum circuit where\neach\n\u221a qubit is \u0001initially prepared in the state |+i =\n1/ 2 |0i + |1i and a controlled phase transformation\nCZ acts successfully on each pair of neighboring qubits.\nThe CZ gate changes the sign of state |11i and acts\ntrivially on the other states of the computational basis.\nThus, a cluster state is the output of a circuit whose\nstructure corresponds to the one indicated on Fig. 1 with\n\u03ba = 2 and the scheme based on unitary transformations\ndirectly applies. Note that the unitary scheme takes advantage of the decreased rank of a reduced density matrix\non the boundary to save one qubit worth of local tomographic effort (\u03ba = 2 vs. k = 3).\n\n\f4\nD.\n\nScheme based on local measurements: Efficient\ndetermination of an MPS estimate\n\n700\n\nWith the experimentally obtained \u03c3\u0302i , we now turn to\nthe task of finding an MPS |\u03c8i such that its reductions\ntr1,...,i;i+k+1,...,N [|\u03c8ih\u03c8|] closely match the \u03c3\u0302i . In other\ni,k\nwords: Let P\u0302m\nbe all possible products of Pauli operators (enumerated by m) that act non-trivially only on\ni\nsites i + 1, . . . , i + k. Then, as the P\u0302m\nare an orthogonal\nbasis, the \u03c3\u0302i may be expanded as\n1 X\ni\ni\ntr[\u03c3\u0302i P\u0302m\n]P\u0302m\n,\n(5)\n\u03c3\u0302i = N\n2 m\n\ni\nwhere the expectations tr[\u03c3\u0302 P\u0302m\n] \u2208 R are obtained as results of tomographic measurements. Then we need to\nfind a matrix |\u03c8ih\u03c8| such that for all m and i the exi\npectations tr[|\u03c8ih\u03c8|P\u0302m\n] coincide with those of the tomoi\ni\ngraphic estimates, tr[|\u03c8ih\u03c8|P\u0302m\n] = tr[\u03c3\u0302i P\u0302m\n].\nThe method of choice for such a problem is singular\nvalue thresholding (SVT) [21, 22], which has been developed very recently in the context of classical compressive sampling or matrix completion [23] and may also be\napplied to the quantum setting [24\u201328]. SVT is a recursive algorithm that provably converges to a low-rank\ni\n]=\nmatrix satisfying constraints of the type tr[|\u03c8ih\u03c8|P\u0302m\ni\ntr[\u03c3\u0302i P\u0302m ]. Unfortunately, a straightforward application of\nSVT requires time and memory that scale exponentially\nwith the number of particles. However, a modification of\nthe algorithm allows us to overcome this problem.\ni\n] the algorithm may\nGiven the measured values tr[\u03c3\u0302i P\u0302m\nthen P\nbe described as follows. First set up the operator\ni\ni\n/2N and initialize \u01760 to some arbiR\u0302 = m,i tr[\u03c3\u0302i P\u0302m\n]P\u0302m\ntrary matrix (e.g., the zero matrix). Then proceed recursively by finding the eigenstate |yn i with largest eigenvalue, yn , of \u0176n and set\n\nX\u0302n = yn\n\nX hyn |P\u0302 i |yn i\nm\ni\nP\u0302m\n,\nN\n2\nm,i\n\n(6)\n\n\u0176n+1 = \u0176n + \u03b4n (R\u0302 \u2212 X\u0302n ).\n\nSo far, this algorithm still suffers from the fact that in every step the 2N \u00d7 2N matrix \u0176n needs to be diagonalized.\nPM\ni\nHowever, the \u0176n are of the form m,i am,i P\u0302m\n, am,i \u2208 R,\ni\nwhere the P\u0302m act non-trivially only on sites i+1, . . . , i+k,\ni.e., they have the form of a local \"Hamiltonian\". Hence,\n|yn i can be determined as the highest energy state of\nthis Hamiltonian. For this task standard methods have\nbeen developed in condensed matter physics [13, 29] for\nwhich the number of parameters scale polynomially in\nthe system size and converge rapidly [30, 31] to the optimal MPS approximation. The standard but exponentially inefficient SVT algorithm possesses a convergence\nproof while our efficient modification does not. Hence,\nwe now present numerical examples for different target\nstates |\u03c6i to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of\nthe proposed algorithm.\n\n1\n1\u2212fN,n\n\n500\n\n300\n\n100\n400\n\nn\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n1\n2\n1 12\n1 162\n2\n30\n\n1\n102\n\n1\n82\n\n1\nN2\n\nFIG. 2. Performance of the MPS-SVT algorithm for the\nground state (the target state |\u03c6i) of the critical Ising model.\nWe chose k = 2, i.e., only nearest neighbour reductions are\nused to reconstruct the state. Plot illustrates the scaling of\nthe error in the fidelity 1 \u2212 fN,n = 1 \u2212 |h\u03c6|yn i|2 \u223c N 2 /n with\nthe number of spins N and the iterations n of the algorithm.\n\nThese numerical examples suggest convergence of our\nalgorithm to a MPS that closely matches the experimentally obtained reductions \u03c3\u0302i . To arrive at the fidelity\nbound we follow the steps of Section II B: (i) Obtain estimates \u03c3\u0302i of the reductions to k adjacent spins %\u0302i of the\nstate in the laboratory such that k\u03c3\u0302i \u2212 %\u0302i ktr \u2264 \u000fi , (ii)\ni\ncompute the expectations pmi = tr[\u03c3\u0302i P\u0302m\n], which are the\ninput to the MPS-SVT algorithm, (iii) obtain a MPS estimate |yn i, the reductions of which closely match the\n\u03c3\u0302i by utilizing the MPS-SVT algorithm. As |yn i is an\nMPS, one can then efficiently obtain a parent Hamiltonian [10] and a lower bound, \u2206, on the energy gap above\nthe ground state (see Methods for details). Putting all\nthis together, the above programme returns a state |yn i,\nP\nits parent Hamiltonian \u0124 = i \u0125i , and a number \u2206 such\nthat\nP\n(\u000fi + tr[\u0125i \u03c3\u0302i ])\n.\n(7)\nhyn |%\u0302|yn i \u2265 1 \u2212 i\n\u2206\n\nE.\n\nExample: Strongly interacting quantum systems\n\nWe start with ground states of nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians on a chain, i.e., the |\u03c6i = |gsi are completely determined by all the reductions to two adjacent spins and\nwe expect the above algorithm not only to produce states\nthat match the reduced density matrices of the ground\nstates but, in fact, states that are themselves close to the\nground states. Among ground states of one-dimensional\nnearest-neighbor Hamiltonians, those at a critical point\nare the most challenging to approximate by MPS as they\nviolate the entanglement area law [32]. We demonstrate\n\n\f5\n\n\ufffd\n\ndetermine the ground state |gsi (our target state |\u03c6i)\nand its reductions and then computed the fidelity fN,n\nafter n iterations of the MPS-SVT algorithm, see Fig. 3.\n\n1 \u2212 fN,n\n\nF.\n\nExample: W-state preparation in ion traps\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nN\n\nFIG. 3.

As in Fig. 2, we chose k = 2 to reconstruct the\nstate. The plot shows densities (arrows indicate the mean)\nobtained from 1000 random realizations. Similar to the Ising\nmodel, the scaling for fixed n of 1 \u2212 fN,n is better than \u223c N 2 .\n\nthe effectiveness of our algorithm for such an example:\nthe critical Ising model in a transverse field on a chain\nof length N with open boundary conditions. The ground\nstate of this Hamiltonian is unique and hence it is completely characterized by its reductions to k = 2 neighbouring sites. In other words, if we find an MPS that has\nthe same reductions, the fidelity will be one. We proceed\nas follows. (i) We obtain the reductions %\u0302i to two neighbouring sites of the true ground state, (ii) from these\nreductions we obtain the expectations pmi = tr[%\u0302i P\u0302mi ],\nwhich are the input to the MPS-SVT algorithm. In Fig. 2\nwe show the fidelity fN,n = |hyn |\u03c6i|2 of the true ground\nstate |\u03c6i and the n'th iterate of the above algorithm as\na function of n and the length N of the chain. It shows\nthat for fixed system size 1 \u2212 fN,n decreases as \u223c 1/n\nwhile for fixed n it increases slower than N 2 . This provides an indication that our algorithm is polynomial in\nthe system size.\nThe Ising model is solvable and, in order to show that\nwe are not considering a special case that is particularly favourable, we also consider one-dimensional random Hamiltonians of the form\n\u0124 =\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\n(i) (i)\n\nr\u0302i r\u0302i+1 ,\n\n(8)\n\ni=1\n\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\nwhere the r\u0302i , r\u0302i+1 act on spin i and i + 1, respectively,\nand are hermitian matrices with entries that have real\nand imaginary part picked from a uniform distribution\nover [\u22121, 1]. For each Hamiltonian, as before, we first\n\nOur method is of interest for many situations in which\nstandard tomography will not be feasible. This is the\ncase for the verification of state preparation in experiments with too many particles. An example is the recent\nion trap experiment [3] for the preparation of \u221a\nW-states,\n|\u03c6i = (|10 * * * 0i + |010 * * * 0i + * * * + |0 * * * 01i)/ N , that\nwere limited to 8 qubits principally because the classical postprocessing of data became prohibitive for longer\nchains. Here we demonstrate the efficiency of our approach (we are not limited to few ions and demonstrate\nconvergence for up to 20 ions \u2013 even higher number of\nions are easily accessible due to the MPS alteration of\nthe SVT method) by illustrating how one would postprocess experimentally obtained reduced density matrices to\nguarantee the generation of |\u03c6i or a state very close to it.\nNote that, as in the above spin chain examples, one need\nonly take tomographic data on pairs (k = 2) of neighbouring qubits. We mimic experimental noise by adding\nGaussian distributed random numbers with zero mean\nto the pmi . After initializing the algorithm with \u01760 = R\u0302,\nwhere we obtain R\u0302 from the MPS representation of |\u03c6i,\nP\ni,k\nwe use xn := mi |pm,i \u2212hyn |P\u0302m\n|yn i| as a figure of merit\nfor convergence, i.e., after a given number of iterations,\nwe pick the |yn i with minimum xn . The result of such a\nprocedure is shown in Fig. 4.\nIII.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe have presented two schemes that efficiently produce\nan MPS description as a tomographic estimate of a quantum state, along with a tight fidelity bound. We emphasize that no assumptions are necessary for our scheme; if\nno such MPS description exists, this will be evident from\nthe local tomographic data and our schemes will herald\na failure. However, the enormous successes of MPS for\ndescribing both one-dimensional quantum systems found\nin nature as well as a host of states relevant to quantum\ninformation ensures that our methods will be very useful\nin practice.\nSo far we presented the method for pure states and onedimensional systems. Various generalizations are possible: Our first scheme using unitary control can also\nhandle mixed states corresponding to small ensembles\nof pure MPS. Suppose we are presented with a state %\u0302\nthat is a mixture of M pure states, each of which is an\nMPS having bond dimension D. Then the reduction of\n%\u0302 to any subsystem has rank at most M D. We can proceed as before, performing unitary operations on blocks\nof \u03ba = dlogd (M D)e + 1 sites, in order to disentangle individual sites from the rest of the chain.

Performance of the MPS-SVT algorithm\u221afor Wstates, |\u03c6i = (|10 * * * 0i + |010 * * * 0i + * * * + |0 * * * 01i)/ N . We\nare not limited to few ions and demonstrate convergence for\nup to 20 ions \u2013 even higher number of ions are easily accessible due to the MPS alteration of the SVT method, demonstrating the efficiency of our approach. We mimic experimental noise by adding Gaussian distributed random numbers\nwith zero mean to the local expectations pmi = tr[\u03c3\u0302i P\u0302mi ] and\nshow results for n = 4000 MPS-SVT iterations. Plot shows\nfN,n = |h\u03c6|yn i|2 as a function of the number of ions, N , for no\nnoise (dots) and Gaussian noise (densities obtained from 100\nrealizations for each N , arrows indicate mean) with a standard deviation of 0.005 (blue; only even values of N plotted\nfor clarity) and 0.01 (black, odd N ).\n\nthe chain, we will find a mixed state \u03b7 of rank M on the\nlast \u03ba \u2212 1 sites. We decompose \u03b7 as a mixture of M pure\nstates. This yields a representation of %\u0302 as an ensemble of\nM pure MPS, each with bond dimension at most dM D.\nOur second scheme using local measurements can also\nbe extended to handle mixed states. While the k-particle\nreduced density matrices do not uniquely determine the\nmixed state %\u0302, reconstructions of better and better quality can be obtained by increasing k. As an example,\nsuppose %\u0302 is the Gibbs state corresponding to a k-local\nHamiltonian \u0124, i.e. the state minimizing the free energy\ntr[%\u0302\u0124] \u2212 T S(%\u0302).\n\ntended to mixed states by considering purifications and\ncan then, e.g., also handle thermal states of local Hamiltonians, under the physically reasonable assumption that\nthe entropy density exists [33]. In addition, it can be generalized to all mixed finitely correlated states (FCS) [9],\nthough it is not always possible to certify the resulting\nestimates.\nHigher-dimensional systems are more challenging, because the most straightforward generalization of MPS,\nknown as projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) [34],\ncannot be computed as efficiently. However, the certification method using a frustration-free parent Hamiltonian remains efficient in the case of qubits with nearestneighbor couplings [35]. Combinations of our techniques\ncan be used to reconstruct other classes of states, such\nas tree tensor networks [36] and multiscale entanglement\nrenormalization ansatz (MERA) states [37], for which efficient heuristics for minimizing local Hamiltonians are\navailable.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors acknowledge discussion with F.G.S.L.\nBrand\u00e3o at early stages of this project.

Thus, it yields a valid MPS\n\n\f7\ndescription if every unitary exactly disentangles one qudit. Put another way, while it is crucial to obtain a good\nestimate of the d\u03ba\u22121 -dimensional subspace on which \u03c3\u0302 is\nsupported, it is not necessary to identify the eigenvectors\nof \u03c3\u0302 exactly : any set of orthonormal vectors generating\nthe subspace is sufficient for our tomography procedure\nand leads to an MPS description in another gauge [10].\nThis property will be central to our error analysis.\nTo understand the effect of errors and imperfections in\nour tomography procedure, consider the very first step\nof the recursive procedure. Tomography is performed on\nthe first \u03ba sites to ideally find a state with non-maximal\nsupport, and unitary \u00db1 is applied to rotate that state\ninto the subspace H1cutoff = |0i \u2297 (Cd )\u2297n\u22121 . In any experimental setting, the resulting state \u00db1 |\u03c6i would surely\nnot lie entirely in that subspace. This can be either because the state of the system is not exactly an MPS with\nbond dimension D, but merely close to one or because\nour estimate of the density matrix \u03c3\u0302 on sites 1 to \u03ba is\nslightly wrong due to measurements that are, in practice, noisy and restricted to finite precision. Indeed, we\ncan expect that the reduced density matrix on the first \u03ba\nsites will actually be full-rank, though most of its probability mass will lie on a subspace of dimension at most\nD. So, each time we apply a disentangling operation \u00dbi ,\nwe also want to truncate the reduced state to the desired\nsubspace. Similarly, a faulty estimate of \u03c3\u0302 will result in\na small probability mass that lies outside the estimated\nsupport.\nGiven an estimated disentangling unitary \u00db1 , any state\n|\u03c6i can be expressed as\n|0i \u2297 |\u03b71 i + |e1 i\n\u00db1 |\u03c6i = p\n1 + he1 |e1 i\n\n(11)\n\nwhere |e1 i is some sub-normalized error vector supported\non the subspace orthogonal to H1cutoff . The unitary \u00db1\nis chosen to minimize the norm \u000f1 = he1 |e1 i of this error\nvector. It is possible to directly estimate the magnitude\nof the error \u000f1 by measuring the first qudit in the standard basis; the error is equal to the population of the\nnon-zero states.\nIn subsequent steps of the recursion, we are given a\nstate of the form\n|0i\u2297i \u2297 |\u03b7i i + |ecm\ni i\n\u00dbi . . . \u00db1 |\u03c6i = p\ncm\ncm\n1 + hei |ei i\n\n|ecm\ni i\n\nbe\n\u00dbi+1 \u00dbi . . . \u00db1 |\u03c6i =\n=\nwhere\n\n|0i\u2297i \u2297 \u00dbi+1 |\u03b7i i + \u00dbi+1 |ecm\ni i\np\ncm\ncm\n1 + hei |ei i\n|0i\u2297i+1 \u2297 |\u03b7i+1 i + |ecm\ni+1 i\nq\ncm\n1 + hecm\ni+1 |ei+1 i\n\n|ei i + Ui+1 |ecm\ni i\np\n|ecm\ni\n=\ni+1\ncm\ncm\n1 + hei |ei i\n\n(14)\n\n(15)\n\ncm\nand therefore \u000fcm\ni+1 \u2264 \u000fi + \u000fi+1 .\nThus, we see that errors accumulate linearly with\nthe number of particles; if we denote |\u03c8i =\n\u2020\nN \u2212\u03ba+1\n|\u03b7N \u2212\u03ba+1 i the estimated MPS, we\n\u00db1\u2020 . . . \u00dbN\n\u2212\u03ba+1 |0i\nhave\n\n|\u03c6i \u2212 |\u03c8i = |ecm\nN \u2212\u03ba+1 i \u2264\n\nNX\n\u2212\u03ba+1\ni=1\n\n|ei i \u2264 N \u000f (16)\n\nwhere \u000f = maxi |ei i . The overall error is at most the\nsum of the individual errors on each step. In addition,\neach of the \u000fi is revealed during the tomographic procedure because they correspond to the post-selection success probability. This provides a direct method to certify\nthe inferred state.\nB.\n\nParent Hamiltonians\n\nP\nLet |\u03c8i be as in (10) and such that s Mi [s]Mi [s]\u2020 = 1\nfor all i = 1, . . . , N . This can always be achieved by\nsubsuming qudits at the beginning and end of the chain\ninto qudits with higher dimension and successive singular\nvalue decompositions [9, 10]. Now let N, k \u2208 N such that\nN/k \u2208 N, and assume that the MPS is injective [10] such\nthat for all j = k, . . . , N \u2212 2k the set\n\u001a\n\u001b\nMj+1 [s1 ] * * * Mj+k [sk ] si = 1, . . . , di\n(17)\nspans CDj+1 \u00d7Dj+k+1 .

Now consider\nthe following quantity, which will bound the individual\nterms in the previous equation,\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u03b3n,m = min \u03bb P\u0302n P\u0302m + P\u0302m P\u0302n + \u03bb(P\u0302n + P\u0302m ) \u2265 0\n\u001b\n\u001a\n2\n= min \u03bb (P\u0302n + P\u0302m ) \u2265 (1 \u2212 \u03bb)(P\u0302n + P\u0302m )\n\u001a\n\u001b\n2\n= 1 \u2212 max \u03bb (P\u0302n + P\u0302m ) \u2265 \u03bb(P\u0302n + P\u0302m ) ,\n(22)\n\nwhere the maximum is given by the smallest non-zero\neigenvalue of P\u0302n + P\u0302m . Hence\nX\n\u0124 2 \u2265 \u0124 \u2212\n\u03b3n,m P\u0302n \u2265 (1 \u2212 \u03b3)\u0124,\n(23)\n\nand therefore we have the lower bound \u2206E \u2265 1 \u2212 \u03b3,\nwhere\n\u03b3 = max\n\n0\u2264n\u2264N\n\nX\n\n\u03b3n,m .\nm\n1\u2264|n\u2212m|k\u22642k\n\n(24)\n\nInjectivity may fail to hold in certain singular cases.\nThe simplest example given by the family of GHZ-type\nstates \u221a12 (|0, . . . , 0i + ei\u03c6 |1, . . . , 1i). Since any local reduced density matrix is independent of \u03c6, it is impossible\nto distinguish the members of that family based on local\ninformation alone. Indeed, in this example, the ground\nstate space of \u0124 will be two-dimensional, spanned by\n|0, . . . , 0i and |1, . . . , 1i. One may check that the gap\nanalysis above continues to hold in the degenerate case\n(unlike the original in [9]), now certifying the overlap\nbetween %\u0302 and the ground-state space. This fact alone\nimplies an exponential reduction in the number of unknown parameters. It is easy to see that the small remaining uncertainty about %\u0302 can be lifted in our example\nby measuring the \"string operator\" \u03c3x \u2297 . . . \u2297 \u03c3x , which\nhas expectation value cos \u03c6. Using e.g. the results of [38],\nthe method of this particular example immediately generalizes to any MPS with a two-fold degeneracy, such\nas the W state. Higher degeneracies may be treated by\nstraight-forward, but more tedious, methods.\n\nn,m\n1\u2264|n\u2212m|k\u22642k\n\n[1] Vogel, K. and Risken, H.
