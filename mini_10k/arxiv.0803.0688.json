Under such conditions, the interactions of\nultrarelativistic protons and nuclei with radiation can\ndominate over interactions with the ambient gas. These\ninteractions proceed through three channels: (i) inverse\nCompton scattering, p\u03b3 \u2192 p\u03b3 \u2032 , (ii) electron-positron pair\nproduction, p + \u03b3 \u2192 pe+ e\u2212 , and (iii) photomeson production, p\u03b3 \u2192 N + k\u03c0. While the inverse Compton scattering does not have a kinematic threshold, the electronpositron pair production and the photomeson production processes take place when the energy of the photon in the rest frame of the projectile proton exceeds\n2me c2 \u2243 1 MeV and m\u03c0 c2 (1 + m\u03c0 /2mp ) \u2243 145MeV, respectively.\nThe process of inverse Compton scattering of protons is\nidentical to the inverse Compton scattering of electrons,\nbut the energy loss-rate of protons is suppressed by a factor of (me /mp )4 \u2248 10\u221213 . At energies above the threshold of production of electron-positron pairs this process\nis four orders of magnitude slower compare to the losses\ncaused by pair-production. Therefore, generally the inverse Compton scattering does not play significant role\neven in extremely dense radiation fields.\nThe cross-section of (e+ , e\u2212 ) pair production (often\ncalled as Bethe-Heitler cross-section) is quite large, but\nonly a small (\u2264 2me /mp ) fraction of the proton energy is\nconverted to the secondary electrons. The cross-section\nof photomeson production is smaller, but instead a sub-\n\n\u2217 Moscow Institute of Engineering Physics, Kashirskoe sh.\n31,\nMoscow, 115409 Russia; Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Kernphysik,\nSaupfercheckweg 1, D-6917 Heidelberg, Germany ; Electronic address: skelner@rambler.ru\n\u2020 Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 31 Fitzwilliam Place,\nDublin 2, Ireland;\nMax-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Kernphysik,\nSaupfercheckweg 1, D-6917 Heidelberg, Germany; Electronic\naddress: Felix.Aharonian@mpi-hd.mpg.de\n\nstantial (10 percent or more) fraction of the proton energy is transferred to the secondary product. As a result,\nwhen the proton energy exceeds the \u03c0-meson production\nthreshold, the hadronic interactions of protons dominate\nover the pair-production.\nThe cross-section of pair-production is calculated with\na very high accuracy using the standard routines of quantum electrodynamics. The cross-sections of photomeson\nprocesses are provided from accelerator experiments and\nphenomenological studies. Generally, for astrophysical\napplications the data obtained in fixed target experiments with gamma-ray beams of energies from 150 MeV\nto 10 GeV are sufficient, especially in the case of broadband spectra of target photons, when the hadron-photon\ninteractions are contributed mainly from the region not\nfar from the energy threshold of the process.\nThe energy losses of protons in the photon fields, in\nparticular in the context of interactions of highest energy\ncosmic rays with 2.7 K cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR), have been comprehensively studied by\nmany authors (see e.g. Refs. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]). Less attention\nhas been given to calculations of the products energy distributions. Partly this can be explained by the fact that\nthe cross-sections of secondary electrons and gamma-rays\nwith the ambient photons significantly exceeds the crosssections of interactions of protons with the same target\nphotons. Therefore the electrons and gamma-rays cannot\nleave the active regions of their production, but rather\ntrigger electromagnetic cascades in the surrounding radiation and magnetic fields. The spectra of gamma-rays\nformed during the cascade development are not sensitive\nto the initial energy distributions, and therefore simple\napproximate approaches (see e.g. Refs. [6]) can provide\nadequate accuracies for calculations of the characteristics of optically thick sources. This does not concern,\nhowever, neutrinos which freely escape the source and\nthus have a undistorted imprint of parent protons. Moreover, at some specific conditions, the secondary electrons\nfrom the pair- and photomeson production processes can\ncool mainly through synchrotron radiation for which the\nsource can be optically thin (see e.g. [7, 8, 9, 10]). Thus\n\n\f2\nthe exact calculations of spectra of secondary electrons\nare quite important, since the synchrotron radiation of\nthese electrons carry direct information about the energy\nspectra of accelerated protons.\nThe interactions of hadrons with radiation fields can\nbe effectively modeled by Monte Carlo simulations of\ncharacteristics of secondary products. In particular, the\nSOPHIA code [11] provides an adequate tool for the comprehensive study of high energy properties of hadronic\nsources in which interactions of ultrarelativistic protons\nwith ambient low-energy photons dominate over other\nprocesses. At the same time, it is useful to have a complementary tool for study of radiation characteristics of\nhadronic sources, especially when one deals with simple scenarios, e.g. interactions of protons with a homogeneous and isotropic source of radiation in which the\nhadronic cascades (i.e. the next generation particles) do\nnot play an important role. Motivated by this objective,\nin this paper we develop a simple approach based on the\ndescription of the energy distributions of final products\nfrom the photomeson and electron-positron pair production processes in analytical forms which can be easily integrated in any complex model of hadronic interactions\nin high energy astrophysical sources. To a certain extent,\nthis paper can be considered as a continuation of our first\npaper [12] where we obtained analytical presentations for\nproton-proton interactions.\nII.\n\nPHOTOMESON PROCESSES\n\nThe formation of high energy gamma-rays, electrons and neutrinos in photomeson interactions proceeds\nthrough production and decay of non-stable secondary\nproducts, mainly \u03c0 0 and \u03c0 \u00b1 -mesons:\n\u03b3 + p \u2192 n0 \u03c0 0 + n+ \u03c0 + + n\u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 + * * *\n\n(1)\n\nwhere n0 , n+ and n\u2212 are the numbers of produced pions.\nHereafter we will assume that the density of the ambient\nmedium is sufficiently low, thus the pions decay before\nthey interact with the surrounding gas, radiation and\nmagnetic fields. We will also assume that (i) both the\nrelativistic protons and the target low-energy photons are\nisotropically distributed, and (ii) the energy of colliding\nparticles\n\u01eb \u226a m\u03c0 c2 ,\n\nEp \u226b mp c2 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u01eb is the energy of the target photon, m\u03c0 is the\nmass of \u03c0-meson (we will assume that m0\u03c0 = m+\n\u03c0 ), and\nEp and mp are the energy and the mass of proton. Those\nconditions, which are always satisfied in astronomical environments, allows us to obtain simple analytical presentations for energy distributions of the final products of\n\u03c0- decays - photons and leptons.\nThe total cross-section of inelastic \u03b3-p interactions is\na function of the scalar E\u03b3 \u2261 (k * p)/mp , where k and p\nare four-momenta of the photon and proton. The scalar\n\nFigure 1: The total cross-section of the inelastic \u03b3-p interactions as a function of energy of gamma-ray in the proton\nrest frame. The calculations have been performed using the\nroutine of the code SOPHIA [11].\n\nE\u03b3 is simply the energy of the photon in the proton rest\nframe. The total cross-section \u03c3(E\u03b3 ), calculated using the\nroutines of the code SOPHIA [11], is presented in Fig. 1.\nAlthough the production of pions dominate in the \u03b3-p\ninteractions, some other channels, in particular the ones\nleading to production of K- and \u03b7-mesons, contribute\nnoticeably (up to 10 to 20 %) to the overall production\nof photons and leptons. These channels are taken into\naccount in our calculations presented below. They are\nbased on the SOPHIA code which allows simulations of\nall important processes belongs to \u03b3-p interactions.\n\nA.\n\nProduction of gamma-rays\n\nThe inclusive cross-section of production of \u03c0 0 -mesons\nd\u03c3\u03c00 = S(k, p, p\u03c00 ) d3 p\u03c00\n\n(3)\n\ndepends on the momenta k, p, p\u03c00 of the photon, proton\nand \u03c0 0 -meson, respectively.

Then\nZ\n3\nd\u03c3\u03b3 = 2 d p\u03b3 S(k, p, p\u03c00 ) W (p\u03c00 , p\u03b3 ) d3 p\u03c00\n(5)\ncan be treated as the inclusive cross-section of \u03b3-rays\nproduction through the chain \u03b3 + p \u2192 n0 \u03c0 0 + * * * \u2192\n2 n0 \u03b3 + * * * .\nFor isotropic distributions of initial particles, the final\nproducts will be isotropically distributed as well.

Since it is assumed that the target photons\nare isotropically distributed, their angular distribution is\ndescribed as d\u03a9/4\u03c0. Then the production rate of \u03b3-rays\n(i.e. number of \u03b3-rays in the energy interval (E\u03b3 , E\u03b3 +\ndE\u03b3 ) per sec, per 1 cm3 ) can be obtained after integration\nof Eq.

The parameters B\u03b3 , s\u03b3 and \u03b4\u03b3 are quite smooth functions of \u03b7,\nthus for calculations of these parameters at intermediate values of \u03b7 one can use linear interpolations of the\nnumerical results presented in Table I.

Since the spectra of e+ and \u03bd\u0304\u03bc\nfrom the decay of \u03bc+ coincide (see e.g. [13]), the parameters in the Tables II calculated for e+ and \u03bd\u0304\u03bc for small\n\u03b7 should be identical. The slight difference at \u03b7 < 2\u03b70\nis explained by fluctuations related to the the statistical\ncharacter of simulations.\nAt \u03b7 > 2.14 \u03b70 , a new channel is opened for production of \u03bd\u0304\u03bc , because of production of \u03c0 \u2212 -mesons and their\ndecay: \u03c0 \u2212 \u2192 \u03bc\u2212 \u03bd\u0304\u03bc . Therefore for large values of \u03b7 the\nparameters characterizing e+ and \u03bd\u0304\u03bc differ significantly\n(see Table II).

At the decay \u03c0 + \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bd\u0304\u03bc the maximum energy of \u03bd\u0304\u03bc is equal to (1\u2212m2\u03bc /m2\u03c0 ) E\u03c0 \u2248 0.427 E\u03c0 ,\n\n\f7\n\nFigure 4: The same as in Fig. 3 but for muon antineutrinos.\n\nFigure 5: The same as in Fig. 3 but for muon neutrinos.\n\nwhere m\u03bc is the mass of muon. On the other hand, the\nmaximum energy of \u03bd\u0304\u03bc , produced at decay of the muon\nis equal to E\u03c0 . With an increase of the parameter \u03b7, \u03c0 \u2212 mesons start to be produced, the decay of which leads\nto \u03bd\u03bc with maximum energy comparable to the energy of\nthe pion (a detailed discussion of these questions can be\nfound in [12]).\nIn Fig. 5 the function x \u03a6\u03bd\u03bc (\u03b7, x) is shown. The\nhistograms are from Monte-Carlo simulations using the\nSOPHIA code, and the solid lines correspond to the analytical approximations.\n\n3.\n\nE\u03c0\n\nmax\n\n= xmax Ep ,\n\nE\u03c0 min = xmin Ep , ,\n\n(39)\n\nwhere\nx max\n=\nmin\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\np\n1\n\u03b7 \u2212 2 r \u00b1 \u03b7 (\u03b7 \u2212 4 r (1 + r)) .

Therefore, for production of\ne\u2212 and \u03bd\u0304e , at least two pions should be produced.

PHOTONS AND LEPTONS PRODUCED AT\nINTERACTIONS OF PROTONS WITH 2.7K\nCMBR\n\nIn this section we compare the energy spectra of\ngamma-rays, neutrinos, and electrons produced at photomeson interactions. For monoenergetic protons interacting with a radiation field with energy distribution\nfph (\u01eb), the energy spectra of photons and leptons can be\nreduced to the calculation of a one-dimensional integral\ndN\n=\ndx\n\nZ\u221e\nfph (\u01eb) \u03a6(\u03b7, x) d\u01eb ,\n\n(42)\n\n(multiplicity) produced in one inelastic interaction of protons with 2.7 K CMBR as a function of proton energy.\nThe results of numerical calculations are obtained using\nthe energy spectra of secondary photons, electrons and\nneutrinos, and the total cross-section shown in Fig 1.\nNote that below the threshold of production of two pions\none should have the following relations\n1\nhn\u03b3 i + hne+ i = 1 ,\n2\n\nwhere \u01eb0 =\nand x = E/Ep is the fraction\nof energy of the protons transferred to the given type of\nsecondary particle; \u03a6 is one of the functions described in\nthe previous section.\nIn Fig. 6 and 7 we show the energy spectra of \u03b3rays and electrons (left panels) and all neutrino types\n(right panels) produced by protons of energy 1020 eV and\n1021 eV interacting with blackbody radiation of temperature T = 2.7 K. The results depend only on the product Ep \u00d7 T , therefore they can be easily rescaled to a\nblackbody radiation of an arbitrary temperature. The\nchosen radiation field and proton energies are of great\npractical interest in the context of origin and intergalactic propagation of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays. Because\nof interactions with the intergalactic radiation fields, ultrahigh energy \u03b3-rays achieve the observer from distances\nless than 1 Mpc (see e.g. Ref. [14]). The electrons rapidly\ncool via synchrotron radiation or, in the case of very small\nintergalactic magnetic field, initiate electromagnetic cascades supported by interactions of electrons and gammarays with the 2.7 K CMBR. Only neutrinos freely penetrate through intergalactic radiation and magnetic fields\nand thus carry a clear imprint of parent protons.\nIn Fig. 8 we show the average number of secondaries\n\n(43)\n\nThe results of calculations based on approximate analytical presentations of functions \u03a6l satisfy these relations\nwith an accuracy of better than 5%.\nNote that at very low energies the average number\nof \u03b3-rays hn\u03b3 i appears smaller than average number of\npositrons hne+ i. This, at first glance unexpected result\nis actually a direct consequence of the experimental fact\nthat near the threshold the total cross-section \u03c3\u03c0+ of \u03c0 +\nproduction significantly exceeds \u03c3\u03c00 (see Fig. 9).\nIV.\n\nPRODUCTION OF ELECTRON-POSITRON\nPAIRS\n\nAt energies below the photomeson production, the\nmain channel of inelastic interactions for protons with\nambient photons proceeds through the direct production\nof electron-positron pairs. In the rest frame of the proton,\nthis process is described by the so-called Bethe-Heitler\ncross-section. In astrophysical environments, the process\nis more often realized when ultrarelativistic protons collides with low-energy photons,\n\n\u01eb0\n\n\u03b70 m2p c4 /(4Ep ),\n\nhne+ i = hn\u03bd\u0304\u03bc i = hn\u03bd\u03bc i .\n\np + \u03b3 \u2192 e+ + e\u2212 + p\n\n(44)\n\nThe process is energetically allowed when\n\u03b3p \u01eb > m e c 2 ,\n\n(45)\n\nwhere \u03b3p = Ep /mp c2 is the proton Lorentz factor, \u01eb is the\nsoft photon energy, and me is the mass of electron. The\nmaximum energy of the electron (positron) is determined\nby the kinematics of the process\nEe max =\n\n\u03b3p\n1 + 4\u03b3p \u01eb/(mp c2 )\n\n\u0012q\n\u00132\nq\n\u03b3p \u01eb + \u03b3p \u01eb \u2212 m e c 2 .\n\n(46)\nThis equation is valid when \u03b3p \u226b 1 and \u01eb \u226a mp \u03b3p c2 . In\nthe interval\nm e c 2 \u226a \u03b3p \u01eb \u226a m p c 2\n\n(47)\n\nthe maximum electron energy is\nEe max = 4 \u03b3p2 \u01eb ,\n\n(48)\n\nThis applies for Ee max \u226a Ep . In the limit of \u03b3p \u01eb \u226b mp c2\nEe max = mp c2 \u03b3p = Ep ,\n\n(49)\n\n\f9\n\nFigure 6: The energy spectra of stable products of photomeson interactions of a proton of energy Ep = 1020 eV with the 2.7 K\nCMBR.

If we are interested in a distribution of some\nvariable \u03be, which is a function \u03c6 of particle momenta,\n\nthis distribution can be found introducing an additional\n\u03b4-function under the integral in Eq.(51):\nZ\nZ\n(k * up )\nd\u03a9\ndN\n= c2 d\u01eb\nfph (\u01eb)\n\u03b4(\u03be \u2212 \u03c6) d\u03c3 .

(62) and (67) do not distinguish between electrons and positrons. Let's discus the\ncondition of applicability of Eqs. (62) and (67). In the\nproton rest system, the cross-section of production of an\nelectron-positron pair by the proton and in the Coulomb\npotential coincide for all emission angles of pairs, when\n\u03c9 \u226a mp . In the laboratory frame this is equivalent to the\ncondition \u01eb\u03b3p \u226a mp , which, taking into account Eq.(48),\ncan be written in the form Ee max \u226a Ep . Thus, the above\nobtained results can be applied to production of electrons\nand positrons when Ee \u226a Ep .\nIn Fig. 10 we show the energy distributions of electrons\nand positrons produced in interactions of protons of three\ndifferent energies with the 2.7 K CMBR: 6.4 \u00d7 1019 eV,\n1020 eV and 3 \u00d7 1020 eV. Note that the energy of primary proton 6.4 \u00d7 1019 eV is interesting in the sense\nthat at this energy the loss-rates of protons, Ep\u22121 dEp /dt,\n\ndue to pair production and photomeson production are\nequal. The spectral energy distribution of electron and\npositrons from the pair production process, E 2 dN/dE,\nhas a bell-type shape with a broad maximum around\n(me /mp )Rp \u223c 10\u22123 Ep . This spectrum is quite different\nfrom the dN/dE \u221d E \u22127/4 type energy dependence as it\nwas hypothesized in [10]. Fig. 10 demonstrates that while\nthe low energy range of electrons (positrons) is dominated\nby the process of pair production, at higher energies\nthe main contribution comes from photomeson processes.\nFortunately, in the energy range where Eqs. (62) and (67)\nare not valid, the contribution of pair-production to the\nspectrum of electrons is negligible compared to the contribution of photomeson processes.\nIt should be noted that the \u03b4-functional approximation, which is often used for qualitative estimates of characteristics of products of high energy interactions, in this\nspecific process does not provide adequate accuracy. The\nreason is that the electrons produced in a single act of interaction have very broad energy distribution. The calculations show that the \u03b4-functional approximation leads to\nsignificant deviation from exact result given by Eq.(62),\neven when one takes into account the energy dependence\nof the average fraction of the proton energy transferred\nto the electron.\n\nA.\n\nEnergy losses\n\nThe analytical presentations of the energy spectra of\nstable products of interactions of protons with ambient\nlow energy photons allows us to calculate the energy\nlosses of protons in a radiation field with arbitrary en-\n\n\f12\n\nFigure 11: The average energy lose rates of protons in the\nCMBR with temperature 2.726 K. The lines are obtained using our method of integration of energy spectra of all final\n(stable) secondaries, the points are from [5]. They are obtained from Monte Carlo simulations of interactions of protons with the CMBR photons using the SOPHIA code. The\ndashed and dash-dotted lines describe the energy losses due\nto pair-production and photomeson interactions, respectively,\nthe solid lines represent the sum of these two contributions.\n\nergy distribution,\n1 dEp\n=\nEp dt\n\nZ1\n0\n\ndx x\n\nZ\u221e\n\nd\u01eb fph (\u01eb) \u03a6(\u03b7, x) ,\n\n(68)\n\n\u01ebmin\n\nwhere \u01ebmin = \u03b70 m2p c4 /(4Ep ), and \u03a6(\u03b7, x) is the sum of all\nseven energy distribution (relevant to \u03b3, e+ , e\u2212 , \u03bd\u03bc , \u03bd \u0304\u03bc ,\n\u03bde , \u03bd \u0304e ) derived in Sec.2. Eq.(68) describes the average energy losses transferred to gamma-rays and leptons. In order to calculate the energy losses due to pair-production\none should multiply Eq.(67) to 2Ee and integrate over\ndEe .\nCalculations of energy losses of protons can be performed directly, without intermediate calculations of energy distributions of secondary photons and leptons. In\nthis regard, the energy losses of protons in 2.7 K CMBR\nhave been studied in great details by many authors, in\nparticular by Berezinsky and coauthors [3] based on a\nsemi-analytical method of calculations and Stanev et al.\n[5] based on Monte Carlo simulations using the SOPHIA\ncode. Therefore it is interesting to compare our results\nwith direct calculations of energy losses. In Fig. 11 we\nshow the energy lose rate of protons in the blackbody\nradiation field with temperature T = 2.726 K. For comparison, we show the result of calculations performed using the code SOPHIA [5]. The agreement of two calculations is an indirect test of a good accuracy of the obtained above approximate analytical presentations for energy distributions of stable products from proton-photon\ninteraction.\n\nFigure 12: The interaction rates of protons with photons\nof 2.7 K CMBR (left axis) and the coefficient of inelasticity\n(right axis). The curves 1a and 2a are the electron-positron\nand photomeson production rates, respectively. The curves\n1b and 2b are the average energy lost by a proton of given\nenergy due to pair production and photomeson production,\nrespectively.\n\nIn Fig. 12 we show the interaction rate of protons\nwith 2.7 K CMBR, as well as the fraction of energy lost\nby the proton per interaction (the so-called inelasticity\ncoefficient). Close to the threshold of pair production\naround E \u2243 1018 eV, hxie+ e\u2212 = 2me /mp \u2248 1.1 * 10\u22123 ,\nas it expected from the kinematics of the process. However, with an increase of energy, hxi\u03c0 gradually decreases\ndown to 10\u22124 at 1020 eV. This effect has been noticed\nalso in [4, 17]. In the case of photomeson production\nthe inelasticity coefficient has a quite different behavior. At the threshold, hxi\u03c0 increases from the value of\nm\u03c0 /(mp + m\u03c0 ) \u2248 0.13 to approximately 0.4 at energy\n1022 eV. Therefore, despite the fact that the cross-section\nof pair production significantly, by two orders of magnitude, exceeds the cross-section of photomeson production, the energy losses at high energies are dominated by\nphotomeson interactions.\n\nV.\n\nCALCULATIONS FOR POWER-LAW\nDISTRIBUTION OF PROTONS\n\nInstead of integrating Eqs. (11) and (30) over d\u01eb, it\nis more convenient to perform integration of these equations over d\u03b7.

For a power-law distribution of protons,\nfp (Ep ) \u221d Ep\u2212\u03b1 , the function H(\u03b7, E) has a maximum at\n\u03b7/\u03b70 \u2248 3 E/E\u2217 ; the position of the maximum slightly depends on the power-law index \u03b1 of the proton distribution. The function H(\u03b7, E) for \u03b3-rays is shown in Fig. 13\nat E\u03b3 = 0.5 E\u22c6 and two power-law indices, \u03b1 = 2 and 2.5.\nAt low energies the function H(\u03b7, E) drops very quickly.\nA cutoff in the spectrum of protons results to faster decrease of H(\u03b7, E) and to a shift of the point of maximum\ntowards smaller \u03b7. For electrons and neutrinos H(\u03b7, E)\nhas similar behavior - a maximum at \u03b7 \u226a 100 \u03b70 and\nstrong decrease with increase of \u03b7.\nTo use the analytical parameterizations for distributions of photons and electrons given by Eq.(27) and\nEq.(31) and related Tables I,II,III, which are applicable\nfor \u03b7/\u03b70 \u2264 100, the following condition should be fulfilled: 3 E/E\u2217 \u226a 100. In this case the main contribution\nto the integral (69) comes from the region \u03b7 \u226a 100 \u03b70 , i.e.\nfrom events close to threshold. Therefore the obtained\napproximate analytical presentations allow calculations\nof distribution of particles in the energy range E . E\u2217 .\nFinally, let's discuss the production of photons and leptons at interactions of photons with a realistic distribution of protons, namely a power-law with an exponential\n\nIn Figs. 14 \u2013 17 we show the spectra of photons, electrons, and neutrinos produced in photomeson interactions calculated for 4 values of the cutoff energy in the\nproton spectrum Ecut = 0.1 * E\u2217 , E\u2217 , 10 * E\u2217 and 103 * E\u2217 ,\nrespectively. The case Ecut = 103 * E\u2217 is almost identical\nto a pure power-law spectrum of protons.\nIn Figs. 18 and 19 we compare the spectra of electrons\n(and positrons) produced through the pair production\nchannel with the spectra of electrons from the decay of\nphoto-produced charged pions.\nFinally, in Fig. 20, we show the steady-state spectra\nof cooled electrons. We assume that electrons are cooled\nvia synchrotron radiation in the intergalactic magnetic\nfield B = 1 \u03bcG and inverse Compton (IC) scattering on\nthe 2.7 K CMBR. Since the production spectrum of pairproduced electrons below E \u223c 1015 eV drops sharply (see\nFigs. 18 and 19), the synchrotron and IC cooling (in the\nThomson regime) leads to the formation of a standard\nE \u22122 type spectrum. This is clearly seen in Fig. 20.\nIn Fig. 21 we show the spectra of synchrotron and\nIC radiation of secondary electrons produced via pairproduction and photomeson production channels for a\nfixed magnetic field of B = 1 \u03bcG, the temperature of\nCMBR T = 2.7 K and for 4 different cutoff energies in the\nproton spectrum Ecut . Fig. 21a corresponds to the cutoff\nenergy of protons E = 0.1E\u2217 . In this case the electrons\nare contributed mainly from pair-production process\nwith a maximum in the energy distribution (E 2 dN/dE)\nat energy E \u223c 1015 eV. While synchrotron radiation of\nthese electrons peaks at E\u03b3 \u221d BE 2 \u223c 106 eV, the maximum of the IC radiation appears, because of the KleinNishina effect, at E\u03b3 \u223c E\u00b1 \u223c 1014 \u2212 1015 eV. Note that\nalthough energy density of the magnetic field corresponding to B = 1\u03bcG is B 2 /8\u03c0 \u2248 4\u00d710\u221214 erg/cm3 , i.e. an order of magnitude smaller than the energy density of 2.7 K\nCMBR, emissivity of the synchrotron and IC components\nare comparable. This is also a direct consequence of the\nreduction of the cross-section of IC scattering of 1015 eV\nelectrons in the Klein-Nishina regime. The second component of synchrotron radiation related to the electrons\nfrom photomeson processes peaks at much higher energies, E\u03b3 \u223c 1012 eV, however its contribution is not significant because of suppression of the protons at energies\nabove the threshold of photomeson reactions. The increase of the cutoff energy in the proton spectrum, Ecut ,\nleads to dramatic, orders of magnitude, increase of the\nemissivity of the synchrotron radiation of photomeson\n\n\f14\nelectrons (see Figs. 21b,c,d). At the same time, because\nof the Klein-Nishina cross-section, only pair-produced\nelectrons contribute to the IC radiation. Therefore the\ncutoff energy Ecut does not have any impact on the IC\nspectrum and emissivity, as it is seen in Figs. 21.\nVI.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe present simple analytical parametrizations for energy distributions of photons, electrons, and neutrinos\nproduced in interactions of relativistic protons with an\nisotropic monochromatic radiation field. The results on\nphotomeson processes are obtained using numerical simulations of proton-photon interactions based on the public available Monte-Carlo code SOPHIA. We also developed a simple formalism for calculations of energy spectra of electrons and positron from the pair production\n(Bethe-Heitler) process based on the well-known differential cross-section in the rest frame of the proton. The\nenergy loss-rate of protons due to photomeson and pairproduction processes in the 2.7 K CMBR calculated by\nintegrating the energy distributions of the stable products of interactions is in excellent agreement with re-\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n\nF.W.

Note that the contribution of electrons (curve 3) in left panel appears below the low bound of y axis\n\nFigure 19: The same as in Fig. 18, but for cutoff energies Ecut = 10E\u2217 (left panel) and Ecut = 1000E\u2217 (right panel)\n.\n\n\f17\n\nFigure 20: The cooled spectra of electrons and positrons, N = N+ + N\u2212 . Dashed lines - electrons produced through the\npair-production channel, dot-dashed lines - electrons produced through photomeson interactions. The sum of two contributions\nis shown by solid curves. The proton spectrum is given in the form of Eq.(72), with Ecut = 0.1 * E\u2217 (a), E\u2217 (b), 10 * E\u2217 (c) and\n1000 * E\u2217 (d).\n\nFigure 21: The synchrotron and IC spectra of cooled electrons. Dashed line corresponds to synchrotron (S) and IC radiation of\nelectrons and positrons produced in the pair-production process, the dotted line corresponds to radiation of positrons (electrons)\nproduced through photomeson interactions. Curve 1 (solid line) is the sum of these contributions. Curve 2 represents the\nspectrum of gamma-rays produced at decay of photoproduced \u03c0 0 -mesons. The proton spectrum is given in the form of Eq.(72),\nwith Ecut = 0.1E\u2217 (a), Ecut = E\u2217 (b), Ecut = 10 E\u2217 (c) and Ecut = 10 E\u2217 (d). Magnetic field B = 1 \u03bcG, temperature T = 2.7 K.\n\n\f"}
