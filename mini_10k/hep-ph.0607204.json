We show\nthat supersymmetric models with R parity violation and baryon number violation have a significant\nrange of parameter space in which the Higgs dominantly decays to six jets. These decays are much\nmore weakly constrained by current LEP analyses and would allow for a Higgs mass near that of the\nZ. In general, lighter scalar quark and other superpartner masses are allowed and the fine-tuning\ntypically required to generate the measured scale of electroweak symmetry breaking is ameliorated.\nThe Higgs would potentially be discovered at hadron colliders via the appearance of new displaced\nvertices. The lightest neutralino could be discovered by a scan of vertex-less events LEP I data.\n\nThe Standard Model of particle physics is arguably the\ncrowning achievement of the last half-century's work towards the understanding of the laws of nature at short\ndistances. However, two somewhat nagging features remain. The first is that while statistical fits of standard\nmodel parameters to precision measurements produce a\nbest fit value for the Higgs scalar mass of 85+39\n\u221228 GeV\n[1], LEP II places a lower bound of 114.4 GeV at 95%\nCL [2]. While these constraints taken together do not\nconstitute a discrepancy, a Higgs mass measured below\nthe current LEP bound would have improved the fit to\nprecision data. In addition, it has been argued that the\nelectroweak observables most sensitive to the Higgs mass\nare themselves not in good agreement and imply a discrepancy with the LEP II bound [3]. The second feature\nis that the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking is very\nsensitive to quantum corrections. If the standard model\nis valid to some very high energy scale M \u226b 1 TeV,\nthe parameters of the ultraviolet theory would require\nan unnatural tuning of order one part in (M/1 TeV)2 to\nmaintain the hierarchy. While this fact alone does not\nguarantee new physics beyond a Higgs boson at the electroweak scale, it is strongly suggestive of physics at the\nweak scale which stabilizes scalar masses with respect to\nradiative corrections.\nA well-known solution to the naturalness problem is to\nimpose supersymmetry on the standard model and softly\nbreak it at a scale of M \u223c 1 TeV (for a review, see [4]).\nRadiative corrections to scalar masses in these theories\nare proportional to the scale of supersymmetry breaking\nand therefore naturally stabilize the mass of the Higgs at\naround the weak scale. Remarkably, the minimal version\nof these theories predict the unification of couplings at a\nrenormalization scale near the Planck scale. A discrete\nsymmetry, R parity, is introduced to forbid dimensionfour baryon and lepton number violating operators and\navoid proton decay as we discuss below.\nWhile the MSSM (Minimal Supersymmetric Standard\nModel) contains over a hundred new parameters, it has\nbecome tightly constrained. A robust constraint on the\nMSSM is the bound on the Higgs mass. The physical\nmass gets contributions which depend only logarithmically on superpartner masses (for example, the scalar\n\ntop quark mass) through corrections to the Higgs quartic interaction. On the other hand, the Z boson mass\nand the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking gets corrections proportional to superpartner masses. To satisfy\nthe current bound on the physical mass, large scalar top\nmasses (mt\u0303 \u2243 1 TeV) are required. For a large cutoff\n\u039b, say of order the Planck scale, contributions to the\n(squared) Z mass will be roughly of order the superpartner masses, say \u03b4m2Z \u223c m2t\u0303 . A cancelation would be\nrequired among contributions with a tuning of the order\none part in (mt\u0303 /mZ )2 . Thus, 1 TeV scalar tops would require \u223c 1% tuning. A beautiful discussion of this tension\nin the MSSM is contained in [5].\nOne possible resolution to the paradox is that the Higgs\nis in fact light but missed by experiments. The quoted\nlower bound on the Higgs mass comes from analyses assuming a Higgs with standard model properties such as a\nstandard model cross section for Z-Higgs production and\nstandard model branching ratios into bottom quarks and\ntau leptons. If the branching ratio to standard model\nfinal states are uniformly suppressed by, for example, a\nfactor of five \u2013 and the new decay modes are not picked\nup by any LEP searches \u2013 the 95% CL lower limit on\nthe Higgs mass reduces to roughly 93-95 GeV (see Figure 2 of [2]). Our model exploits this weakness. Other\nattempts to modify Higgs decays for the purpose of naturalness have been made in the context of the next-tominimal supersymmetric standard model [6], and in a\ngeneral analysis of the MSSM with an additional singlet\nsuperfield [? ].\nIn this letter, we show that in the MSSM with R parity violation and non-unified gaugino masses, there is a\nsignificant amount of parameter space in which the Higgs\ndominantly decays to a pair of unstable neutralinos, each\nof which subsequently decays to three quark jets. The parameter space allows, as we detail below, Higgs masses\naround the Z mass even with a standard model production cross section; this is our main result.\nR parity is a symmetry under which all superpartners\nare odd. It forbids the following renormalizable operators\n\n\f2\nin the superpotential:\nW \u2283 \u03bci Li H\u0304 + \u03bbijk Li Lj Ekc + \u03bb\u2032ijk Li Qj Dkc\n+ \u03bb\u2032\u2032ijk Uic Djc Dkc ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere L, E c , H\u0304, Q, U c , and Dc are lepton doublet, lepton singlet, up-type Higgs, quark doublet, up-type quark\nsinglet, and down-type quark singlet superfields respectively, and the ijk are flavor indices. These interactions violate lepton number (the first line) and baryon\nnumber (the second). Their existence would predict unacceptable levels of proton decay unless at least some\nof these couplings are extremely small. However, proton stability could be provided by a symmetry that allows only the lepton-number or baryon-number violating terms [7]. In this paper, we focus on the latter.\nBounds on the individual \u03bb\u2032\u2032 couplings are only stringent from neutron\u2013anti-neutron oscillations and double\n\u22124\n\u22127\n\u2032\u2032 <\nnucleon decay, requiring \u03bb\u2032\u2032112 <\n\u223c 10 and \u03bb113 \u223c 10 for\n200 GeV scalar quark and gluino masses. The other seven\ncoupling are less constrained. The tightest bounds are\non products of two different couplings which range from\n\u03bb\u2032\u2032ijk \u03bb\u2032\u2032i\u2032 j \u2032 k\u2032 < 10\u22122 \u2212 10\u22124 and come dominantly from limits on rare hadronic decays of B mesons. For a broad\nreview of R parity violation in supersymmetry, see [8].\nDo LEP searches put a bound on a Higgs that decays to 6 quarks (via two neutralinos)? No analysis has\nbeen performed looking for this exclusive final state. A\ndecay-mode-independent search for a Higgs boson was\nperformed by the OPAL experiment (by looking for the\nassociated Z in leptonic channels [9]) and puts a lower\nbound of 82 GeV when the production cross section is\nequal to that of the standard model. In addition, the\nsearch for a Higgs decaying to two jets of any flavor [10]\ncould be sensitive to our Higgs to six jets when the latter can be forced into a two-jet topology (there may also\nbe sensitivity from h \u2192 2b when each neutralino decay\ncontains a b quark). An analysis of this type was done\nby DELPHI [11] in the search for a cascade decay of the\nHiggs to four b quarks via two pseudo scalars, a [12].\nThey modified the search for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 hZ \u2192 (bb\u0304)Z to be\nsensitive to the cascade h \u2192 aa \u2192 bb\u0304bb\u0304 by forcing the\nlatter into two jets and estimating the efficiency of the\nh \u2192 2b search to pick up h \u2192 4b. Comparing Tables\n27 and 29 in [11], one can see that DELPHI rules out a\n100 GeV Higgs decaying exclusively to bb\u0304 with roughly\na quarter of the standard model cross section, while it\nrequires 80% of the cross section to rule out the same\nmass Higgs decaying to 4b's (about three times the signal events). In our case, the Higgs decays to six jets and\nthus the jets will be softer and more numerous and thus\nharder to reconstruct into two jets. To see the effect of\nsofter jets, the same tables show that for a 65 GeV Higgs\ndecaying to 4b's vs. 2b's requires 7-8 times more signal\nevents \u2013 and this is even with pseudo scalars as light as\n12 GeV. In addition, part of the DELPHI analysis takes\nadvantage of the additional b quarks in the final state,\nwhereas our final state will have at most 2b's. Assuming\n\nthe loss of the extra b quarks in the final state cuts the\nefficiency in half, we estimate that our soft jets with 2\nb's in the final state would be picked up by the 2b search\nwith an efficiency of \u223c 1/7 \u00d7 1/2 \u223c 7%. This would also\nbe true of the flavorless search [10], which is similar to the\n2b search with the b-tagging requirement removed. While\nwe feel this estimate is conservative, it is very rough and\na full analysis is warranted.\nWhat are the constraints on the mass of the lightest\nneutralino? The neutralino should be light enough to allow for our Higgs decay (<\n\u223c 50 GeV), while the lightest\nchargino must satisfy its current lower bound (\u223c 103 GeV\nin most of parameter space, even for R-parity violating\ndecays [13]). This constrains the MSSM parameters such\nthat M1 < M2 , \u03bc, and the lightest neutralino is mostly\nbino \u2013 although it must have enough of a higgsino component to allow the Higgs width to be dominated by this\ndecay, and thus the \u03bc parameter shouldn't be too much\nlarger than 100 GeV as we see below (see also [14]).\nThe remaining question then is how could such a light\nneutralino with strong enough couplings to dominate the\nHiggs width not being detected indirectly by its effect\non the Z width or directly in searches at LEP II. There\nare two reasons: the first is that the width of the Z in\nthe standard model (\u223c 2.5 GeV) is three orders of magnitude bigger than the standard model width of a 100\nGeV Higgs. The second is that in the range of small to\nmoderate bino-higgsino mixing, the Higgs decay rate into\nneutralinos is roughly proportional to the mixing angle\nsquared while the same rate for the Z goes like the mixing angle to the fourth power. The decay width of the Z\ninto the lightest neutralino at tree level is\n\u0393\u03c70 = \u0393\u03bd \u00d7 \u22062\n\ns\n\n1\u2212\n\n\u0012\n\n2m\u03c7\nmZ\n\n\u00132\n\n1\u2212\n\n\u0012\n\nm\u03c7\nmZ\n\n\u00132 !\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u2206, defined in the appendix, is roughly the binohiggsino mixing angle squared, and \u0393\u03bd is the standard\nmodel Z width into one species of neutrino. We require\nthis contribution to the total and hadronic widths to\nbe less than 0.1% \u2013 roughly 1\u03c3 as determined by the\nelectroweak fit [1]. This requirement sets a bound of\n\u2206<\n\u223c 1/10 for a very light neutralino, and weaker for heavier neutrinos as phase space gets reduced. We find that\nin most of our parameter space \u2013 where the decay to\nneutralinos dominates the Higgs width and the chargino\nbound is satisfied \u2013 we satisfy this constraint.\nSearches for neutralinos which decay via baryon number violation have been preformed by Aleph, DELPHI\nand L3 [13]. None of the three searches were able to put\na bound on the neutralino mass via a direct search, but\nonly through a search for a chargino and the theoretical assumption M1 = (5/3) tan2 \u03b8W M2 \u223c M2 /2 relating the two masses through the assumption of gaugino\nmass unification.

Each point also satisfies the constraint\non the contribution to the hadronic Z width. We also\nrequire m\u03c70 > 12 GeV to allow for significant phase space\nfor the decay. We see that a large branching ratio requires\nrelatively low values of tan \u03b2 and \u03bc. In Figure 2 we scan\nover M1 , M2 , \u03bc, and tan \u03b2 and plot points which satisfy\nthe chargino mass and Z width bounds. For these points,\nthe branching ratio is less than 25% to normal standard\nmodel decays, thus lowering the Higgs mass bound in this\npart of parameter space to roughly 95-100 GeV according\nto Figure 2 of [2].\nThe scans are done in the decoupling limit (i.e., the\npseudo-scalar mass is fixed at 1 TeV), where the heavier\nCP-even Higgs boson is much more massive and thus all\ncouplings of this lightest Higgs are standard model like.\nAway from this limit, the decay width to standard model\nchannels increases while the overall production cross section goes down. Moderate mixing with the heavier Higgs\ndoes not significantly change the qualitative features of\nthese plots.\nThe decay length of the neutralino can be long enough\nto leave a displaced vertex. The average decay length of\nthe lightest neutralino is [15]\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03c3\u2192\u03bd \u03bd\u0304 , the neutrino pair-production\ncross section,\n\u221a\nis \u223c 1 pb at center of mass energy s = 200 GeV. To\nsatisfy the L3 bound, we require \u2206 < 1/3. This bound\nis satisfied in our entire parameter space. However, if\nscalar leptons are relatively light, a t-channel diagram\ncan dominate the cross section and overwhelm the bound.\nRequiring the cross section to satisfy the L3 constraint\nplaces a lower bound of \u223c 300 GeV on scalar electron\nmasses (in the case degenerate scalars). This becomes\nour strongest constraint on a superpartner mass in the\nbaryon-number violating MSSM. The lightest neutralino,\ndue to the weakness of their couplings and the nature of\ntheir decays, has no significant collider bound within our\nparameter space.\nThe points in parameter space which predict a large\nHiggs to neutralinos branching ratio and satisfy the lower\nbound on the chargino mass satisfy M2 > 3M1 [14], and\nthe effect on the branching ratio becomes unimportant\nabove M2 > 250 GeV.

Finalstate particle masses, Yukawa couplings and QCD corrections have all been neglected. For very small couplings,\nlight neutralinos, or heavy scalar quarks, the decay length\ncould be quite long and might have been seen as anomalous events at LEP if they decay in the tracking chamber,\nand perhaps by searches for stable squarks and gluinos\n[16] if they decay in or near the hadronic calorimeter. If\ntheir decay length is longer than about a meter, the invisible Higgs search would pick up these events and rule\nout masses up to 114 GeV [17].\nWhat does baryon number violation do for susy parameter space? In general, bounds on superpartner masses\nare weaker than in the case of the R-parity conserving MSSM due to a lack of missing energy in the signal. The current bounds of 200 - 300 GeV on squarks\nand gluinos from Tevatron searches came from analyses which required significant missing transverse energy\ncuts [18]. With baryon-number and R-parity violating\ninteractions, the bounds on all superpartners are below\n100 GeV, except for the chargino, whose bound remains\nroughly the same (102.5 GeV) [19]. The bounds on the\nlightest neutralino quoted in the particle data book are\ndue to chargino searches and the requirement of gaugino\nmass unification. The direct search at LEP for a decaying\nlightest neutralino is unable to put bounds on its mass.\n\n\f4\nOf course another impact of this model is the allowance\nof a lighter Higgs mass thus reducing the need for large\nradiative corrections to the quartic potential from the\nstop loop. For the same value of tan \u03b2 = 3, the allowed\nlighter Higgs mass (say around 96 GeV) requires an enhancement of the quartic of only half as much as in the\nMSSM with R-parity conservation. If instead we compare allowed MSSM Higgs masses at large tan \u03b2 to our\nmodel's allowed Higgs masses at tan \u03b2 = 3 (since we require low values for our decay to dominate), we still typically require a lower quartic enhancement by roughly\n10 \u2212 30%. This translates into lower stop masses needed\nand less tuning. However, while R parity violation and\nnon-unified gaugino masses help to relieve much of the\npersistent fine tuning in the MSSM, they clearly do not\neliminate it [20]. Among the strongest constraints are\nthe chargino mass bound and the restrictions on contributions to b \u2192 s\u03b3. In addition, avoiding the Higgs mass\nbound requires one to be in a non-generic part of parameter space in which the Higgs decays to neutralinos.\nR parity violation can allow for other non-standard\nHiggs decays which evade LEP searches. For example,\none linear combination of scalar bottom squarks can be\nperhaps as light as 7.5 GeV [21] due to suppressed couplings to the Z. With baryon number violation, and\nsbottom masses below half the Higgs mass, this would\nallow the Higgs to decay to four light jets, and the decay would dominate standard Higgs decays at moderate\nto large tan \u03b2 [22]. On the other hand, lepton number\nviolation through, for example, the superpotential operator \u03bb\u2032i33 Li Q3 D3c could produce a dominant Higgs decay\nof h \u2192 4b + E\n6 to which the standard 2b and 4b searches\nshould have significantly reduced sensitivity. These and\nother lepton-number violating decays are being explored\n[23].\nIf the above scenario is correct, searching for the Higgs\nat hadron colliders could pose great difficulty. However,\nif the neutralinos decay at a displaced vertex with a decay length greater than about 50 microns, these events\ncould potentially be picked up by a dedicated search at\nthe Tevatron, LHC, or LHCb [24, 25]. The vertex tag-\n\nging at LHCb would be well suited for this search, and\nthe statistics high enough - roughly 30% of the Higgs\nbosons produced via gluon fusion are expected to fall in\nthe detector's acceptance range [26]. In addition, half\nof these decays would be baryon violating (assuming the\nlightest neutralino is a Majorana particle) and this could\npotentially be a striking signal. Finally, the small but\nnon-zero coupling of long-lived neutralinos to the Z may\nallow them to be discovered by studying the beam gas\n(\"vertex-less\") events in LEP I data [27].\nAppendix: The neutralino mass matrix\n\n[1] The\nLEP\nElectroweak\nWorking\nGroup,\nhttp://lepewwg.web.cern.ch/LEPEWWG/.\n[2] [ALEPH Collaboration], arXiv:hep-ex/0602042.\n[3] See, for example, M.
