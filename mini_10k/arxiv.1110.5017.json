The parameter\ndegree-sum \u03c32 (G), or simply \u03c32 , is defined as min{d(u) + d(v)|u, v \u2208 V (G) and uv \u2208\n/\nE(G)}.\n\u2217\n\nSupported by NSFC No.11071130.\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nThe problem in the proof of Proposition 2.5 of [2]\n\nIn [2], Caro et al. got an upper bound of the rainbow connection number in terms of\nthe minimum degree \u03b4 of a connected graph, which is stated as follows:\nProposition 1.1 (Proposition 2.5 of [2]). If G is a connected graph with minimum degree\n\u03b4, then rc(G) \u2264 n \u2212 \u03b4.\nIn the proof they claimed that they will fix \u03b4 and prove the proposition by induction\non n. But the fact is that \u03b4i of Gi is always different from \u03b4. So we cannot use the\ninduction hypothesis. Fortunately, the proposition is true. We give an improved proof of\nthe proposition by induction on n \u2212 \u03b4.\nProof. We prove the proposition by induction on n \u2212 \u03b4. The base case n \u2212 \u03b4 = 1 is trivial\nsince cliques have rainbow connection number 1 = n \u2212 \u03b4. Assume that the proposition\nis true for all connected graphs with n \u2212 \u03b4 < s. Let us consider a connected graph with\nn \u2212 \u03b4 = s.\nLet K be a maximal clique of G consisting only of vertices whose degree is \u03b4. Since\nthere is at least one vertex with degree \u03b4 and since G is connected we have 1 \u2264 k = |K| \u2264\n\u03b4.\nConsider the graph G\u2032 obtained from G by deleting the vertices of K. Suppose the\nconnected components of G\u2032 are G1 , . . . , Gt where Gi has ni vertices and minimum degree\n\u03b4i for i = 1, . . . , t. Let Ki \u2286 K be the vertices of K with a neighbor in Gi , and assume\nthat |K1 | \u2265 |Ki | for i = 1, . . . , t (notice that it may be that t = 1 and G\u2032 is connected).\nConsider first the case that K1 = K. We know that n \u2212 ni \u2265 |K| = k. For any vertex v in\nGi , if dG (v) > \u03b4, then dGi (v) \u2265 dG (v) \u2212 k > \u03b4 \u2212 k; if dG (v) = \u03b4, then v can not be adjacent\nto every vertex in K by the maximality of K, so dGi (v) \u2265 \u03b4 \u2212 (k \u2212 1) > \u03b4 \u2212 k. Thus\nwe have n \u2212 ni \u2265 k > \u03b4 \u2212 \u03b4i , namely ni \u2212 \u03b4i < n \u2212 \u03b4 = s. By the induction hypothesis,\nrc(Gi ) \u2264 ni \u2212 \u03b4i . Clearly, we may give the edges of K and the edges from K to G1 the\nsame color. Hence,\nrc(G) \u2264 t +\n\nt\nt\nX\nX\n(ni \u2212 \u03b4i ) = t + n \u2212 k \u2212\n\u03b4i\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\n\u2264 t + n \u2212 k \u2212 t(\u03b4 \u2212 k + 1)\n= t + n \u2212 k \u2212 t\u03b4 + tk \u2212 t\n= n \u2212 \u03b4 \u2212 (t \u2212 1)(\u03b4 \u2212 k) \u2264 n \u2212 \u03b4.\nNow assume that K1 6= K but that |K1 | = k1 > 1. Similarly, we have ni \u2212 \u03b4i < n \u2212 \u03b4 =\ns. If there exists a Gi with \u03b4i \u2265 \u03b4 \u2212 k + 2, then we can give the edges of K a new color.\n2\n\n\fHence,\nrc(G) \u2264 t + 1 +\n\nt\nX\n\n(ni \u2212 \u03b4i ) = t + 1 + n \u2212 k \u2212\n\ni=1\n\nt\nX\n\n\u03b4i\n\ni=1\n\n\u2264 t + 1 + n \u2212 k \u2212 (t \u2212 1)(\u03b4 \u2212 k + 1) \u2212 (\u03b4 \u2212 k + 2)\n= t + 1 + n \u2212 k \u2212 (t \u2212 1)(\u03b4 \u2212 k) \u2212 t + 1 \u2212 \u03b4 + k \u2212 2\n= n \u2212 \u03b4 \u2212 (t \u2212 1)(\u03b4 \u2212 k) \u2264 n \u2212 \u03b4.\nOtherwise, every Gi has \u03b4i = \u03b4 \u2212k +1, namely there is a vertex vi in Gi adjacent to at least\nk \u2212 1 vertices in K for i = 1, . . . , t. Since K1 6= K, there is a vertex u \u2208 K but u \u2208\n/ K1 .\nFor any vi , i = 1, . . . , t, vi is not adjacent to at most 1 vertex in K. |K1 | = k1 > 1,\nso vi is adjacent to at least 1 vertex in K1 . Now consider any two vertices vi and vj ,\n1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 t. If vi and vj are both adjacent to u, then they have a common neighbor in\nK; if one of them, say vi is not adjacent to u, then vi is adjacent to all vertices in K1 , so\nthey also have a common neighbor in K. Hence we may give the edges of K a used color,\nP\nand so rc(G) \u2264 t + ti=1 (ni \u2212 \u03b4i ) \u2264 n \u2212 \u03b4.\nFinally, if k1 = 1 (and since K1 6= K we have k \u2265 2), contract all of K into a single\nvertex v. Notice that the contracted graph G\u2217 has n \u2212 k + 1 vertices and \u03b4 \u2217 \u2265 \u03b4. So\nn\u2212k +1\u2212\u03b4 \u2217 < n\u2212\u03b4 = s. By induction hypothesis, rc(G\u2217 ) \u2264 n\u2212k +1\u2212\u03b4 \u2217 \u2264 n\u2212k +1\u2212\u03b4.\nGoing back to G and coloring the edges of the clique K with another new color, we obtain\nrc(G) \u2264 n \u2212 k \u2212 \u03b4 + 2 \u2264 n \u2212 \u03b4. The proof is now complete.\n\n2\n\nThe problem in the proof of Theorem 9 of [3]\n\nAs a generalization of the above proposition, Schiermeyer got the following upper\nbound of the rainbow connection number:\nProposition 2.1 (Theorem 9 of [3]). If G is a connected graph with minimum degreedegree \u03c32 , then rc(G) \u2264 n \u2212 \u03c322 .\nIn the proof of the result, Schiermeyer used the same proof method as in Proposition\n2.5 of [2]. So the proof is also not correct. Besides, the author claimed that \"each pair\nof nonadjacent vertices of Gi has degree-sum at least \u03c32 (G) \u2212 2(k \u2212 1) in Gi \", this is\nnot correct. We can give a counter-example. Just take t copies of K\u03b4+4 as H1 , . . . , Ht ,\nt < \u03b4+1\n. vi,1 and vi,2 are two nonadjacent vertices, i = 1, . . . , t. Connect vi,1 and vi,2 to any\n2\n2t vertices in Hi , respectively, the neighbor of vi,1 and vi,2 can be same or different. Let\nK = K\u03b4\u22122t+1 and connect vi,1 , vi,2 to all vertices in K. Denote the graph by G. Then the\nvertices in Hi have degree at least \u03b4+3, vi,1 , vi,2 have degree \u03b4+1 and the vertices in K have\n3\n\n\fdegree \u03b4. Since every vertex with degree \u03b4 is adjacent to every vertex with degree at most\n\u03b4 + 1 and other vertices have degree at least \u03b4 + 3, \u03c32 (G) = d(vi,1) + d(vi,2) = 2(\u03b4 + 1). In\nGi = G[Hi \u222a{vi,1 , vi,2 }], vi,1 and vi,2 are two nonadjacent vertices and dGi (vi,1 )+dGi (vi,2 ) =\n4t. But \u03c32 (G) \u2212 2(k \u2212 1) = 2(\u03b4 + 1) \u2212 2(\u03b4 \u2212 2t + 1 \u2212 1) = 4t + 2 > 4t = dGi (vi,1 ) + dGi (vi,2 ),\ncontradicting the claim. On the other hand, since dGi (v) \u2265 dG (v) \u2212 k, we can get si \u2265\n\u03c32 (G) \u2212 2k. Therefore\nt\nX\n\nX si\nsi\nrc(G) \u2264 t +\n(ni \u2212 ) = t + n \u2212 k \u2212\n2\n2\ni=1\ni=1\nt\n\n\u03c32 (G)\n\u2212 k)\n2\n\u03c32 (G)\n+ tk\n= t+n\u2212k\u2212t\n2\n\u03c32 (G)\n\u03c32 (G)\n\u2212 (t \u2212 1)(\n\u2212 k) + t\n=n\u2212\n2\n2\n\u03c32 (G)\n\u2264 n\u2212\n+ t.\n2\n\n\u2264 t + n \u2212 k \u2212 t(\n\nWhen t is large, this bound is far from n \u2212 \u03c32 2(G) given by the author of [3].
