For example, the efficacy of qubits, the\nbasic building block of a quantum computer, which can\nbe spin qubits, Josephson junction qubits, charge or flux\nqubits depends largely on the environments, or baths, to\nwhich they are often weakly coupled. The effect of environments on the coherence of the qubit has been studied\nin various contexts with particular emphasis on bosonic\nbaths6,7 . In the past few years, the realization of solid\nstate qubits in semiconducting heterojunctions has also\nresulted in the study of spin baths constituted of spins.\nAt very low temperatures, the decoherence engendered\nby a spin environment is expected to dominate the loss\nof the coherence arising from a coupling to phononic degrees of freedom.\nIn the limit of weak coupling between the qubit and\nthe bath, the effect of intrabath interactions have been\nexplored earlier in other works8\u201314 . In some cases, interactions were found to decrease the rate of decoherence,\nthough the exact opposite was seen in cases where the\nspin bath was on the verge of a standard magnetic quantum phase transition12 . On the other hand, the qualitative nature of the decoherence i.e., whether it is Markovian or non-Markovian depends largely on the nature of\nthe initial state of the bath14\u201317 . For baths at zero temperature, the decoherence is often non-Markovian. Examples include the well known spin-boson model6 , and\nmodels of interacting spin environments that we already\nmentioned above11,12 . It has also been found in the case\nof a qubit interacting via the Fermi contact hyperfine\ncoupling with a bath of polarized nuclear spins15 . How-\n\never, for baths in thermal equilibrium i.e., at finite temperatures, the decoherence in the weak coupling limit is\nexpected to be Markovian as in the case of the spinboson model. This aspect was also seen in the case of\ninteracting spin baths at finite temperatures8,10\u201313 . The\nassociated Markovian decay rate was also found to increase with temperature and, unlike the case of bosons,\nwas found to saturate at high enough temperatures.\nSince interactions between spins in condensed matter\nsystems are known to generate a whole range of complex thermodynamic behaviours, it is interesting to ask\nwhether interactions between the bath spins generate\nnovel behaviour for the coherence of a qubit coupled to\nsuch a bath. In this general context, various questions\narise naturally: does the decoherence contain clear signals about the underlying thermodynamic phase of the\nbath? Is Markovian decay to be expected for all interacting spin environments at finite temperatures, where the\nbath is in a statistical mixture at temperature T , and\nnot in a pure state11,18,19 ? And can decoherence or others physical quantities asociated with the qubit be used\nas a sensitive probe of the dynamics of the underlying\nspin environment?\nHere, we shall explore some of these issues by considering the problem of the decoherence of a qubit induced\nby weak coupling to a model spin-bath with non-trivial\ndynamics arising from strong frustration and prepared in\nan initial state which is in thermal equilibrium. Highly\nfrustrated or disordered baths were partially explored in\n[10,11] where complete predictions for the decoherence\ncould be made only for the case of a one dimensional\nIsing bath or for spin shards in the infinite temperature limit. Though these works illustrate the potential\nrichness of interacting environments they also highlight\nthe difficulty and limitations of using analytical methods\n\n\f2\nto study these problems. We adopt a disordered spin\nbath described by the meanfield random Ising model in\na transverse magnetic field. This environment is characterized by a rich thermodynamic phase diagram which\nshows a spin-glass to paramagnetic transition as a function of temperature and external magnetic field20 . The\ntotal Hamiltonian for the system is given by\nH = HB + HSB\nN\nN\nX\nX\n\u03c3iz\nJij \u03c3ix \u03c3jx + h\nHB =\ni=1\n\ni<j\n\nHSB = \u03c3ca\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03bbi \u03c3ia\n\n(1)\n\ni\n\nwhere HB is the bath hamiltonian and HSB denotes\nthe spin-bath interaction. The Pauli matrices \u03c3 c and\n\u03c3 i denote the spin of the qubit and the i-th spin of\nthe bath respectively. The exchange energies Jij are\nquenched random variables with a probability distribu2\n2\n1\ntion P (J) = \u221a2\u03c0\u2206\ne\u2212J /2\u2206 , where the standard deviation of the distribution \u2206 sets the unit of energy. The\nPN\nqubit couples to the bath operator V a = i \u03bbi \u03c3ia , with\na representing either the z or the x component of the\nspins. The coupling constants \u03bb are also taken to be\nquenched random variables. The physics of the bath\nis described by HB , the random transverse Ising model\n(RTIM) which is known to have the following phase diagram: at zero temperature, for transverse fields smaller\nthan a critical field hc , i.e., h < hc , the system is in a\nspin glass phase21 . For h > hc the system is magnetized with a gap in its spectrum. At finite temperatures,\nthe spin glass order survives up to a critical temperature\nTsg (h)22,23 . A physical system which is expected to be\nreasonably described by the above model is LiHox Y1-x F4 ,\nwhere the Ho concentration, x, tunes the system between\ndifferent physical regimes24 . It has been proposed as a\nminimal toy model to investigate the effects of quantum\nentanglement of spins25 . The critical temperature Tsg ,\nthat sets the value of the coefficient \u2206, is of the order of\n1K24 , in the compounds. Consequently, the effective high\ntemperature paramagnetic phases we study in this paper\ncorrespond to rather low real temperatures, where we\nexpect the spin environment to dominate and phononic\ncontributions to the decoherence can be neglected. There\nhave also been propositions for engineering model magnetic environments with very small energy scales using\ncold atoms13 .\nWe note that in the spin glass phase, only the correlations involving the x-component of the spin exhibit spin\nglass features whereas the correlation of the Sz components merely exhibit a gap. Clearly, it would be interesting to explore the effect of these phases on the decoherence of the qubit. Moreover, due to the inherent\n\nanisotropy of the bath, we expect the decoherence to be\ndependent on whether the qubit couples to the x or z\ncomponents of the bath spins. In this paper, we address these questions in the limit of weak qubit-spinbath\ncoupling. Since this problem cannot be studied analytically, we use numerical exact diagonalization methods to\ncalculate the bath eigenstates and eigenvalues and consequently, the resulting decoherence. We obtain a rich\nspectrum of results for the coherence of the qubit and in\nparticular, a non-Markovian i.e., a non-exponential decay\nof the coherence at finite temperatures.\nThe paper is organized as follows: in Sec. II, we present\nthe weak coupling formalism used to calculate the decoherence of the qubit. We present our numerical method\nin Sec. III and use it to study the analytically tractable\ncase of decoherence induced by an Ising chain spin-bath\nso as to benchmark our method. We compare our results\nfor the Markovian decoherence rate with known analytical results for an infinitely long chain, so to establish the\nimportance of the finite size effects introduced by our numerical method. In Sec. IV A, we present our results for\nthe decoherence in the weak coupling regime for the long\nrange Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model which has an Ising\nspin glass phase at low enough temperatures and present\na comparison of our results with some analytical results\nwhich are known in the high temperature paramagnetic\nphase. In Sec. IV B, we present in detail our main results\nfor the decoherence induced by the RTIM spin-bath for\ntwo different couplings of the qubit to the bath. We conclude with a discussion of our results in Sec. V.\n\nII.\n\nWEAK COUPLING FORMALISM\n\nIn this section, we summarize the weak coupling\nformalism11 used to calculate the decoherence. This approach is valid provided the energy associated with the\nqubit-bath coupling is smaller than all the scales of the\nbath. We first assume that at time t = 0, the combined\nsystem of the central spin and the bath have a factorizable initial density matrix: \u03a9 = \u03c1(0) \u2297 \u03c1B . Depending\non the coupling of the central spin to the bath operator\nV a , the qubit is in a pure state whose basis vectors are\ndefined by |\u03c8 a i = \u03b1| \u2190a i + \u03b2| \u2192a i (\u03c1(0) = |\u03c8 a ih\u03c8 a |)\nwhere | \u2190x i = | \u2190i, | \u2192x i = | \u2192i and | \u2190z i = | \u2191i,\n| \u2192z i = | \u2193i. The bath is chosen to be at thermal equilibrium with temperature T \u2261 1/\u03b2 leading to a density\nmatrix\n\u03c1B =\n\ne\u2212\u03b2HB\nZ\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Z = Tr exp(\u2212\u03b2HB ) is the bath partition function.\nThe time evolved reduced density matrix is given by\n\n\f3\n\n\u03c1(t) = |\u03b1|2 | \u2190a ih\u2190a | + |\u03b2|2 | \u2192a ih\u2192a | + M (t)\u03b1\u2217 \u03b2| \u2192a ih\u2190a | + M (t)\u2217 \u03b1\u03b2 \u2217 | \u2190a ih\u2192a |\n\nwhere the factor\n\u0011\n\u0010\na\na\nM (t) = Tr e\u2212i(HB +V )t \u03c1B ei(HB \u2212V )t\n\n(4)\n\nis a measure of the decoherence induced by the bath at\ntime t7,11 . Note that Tr denotes the usual trace as HB\nand V a are operators in the bath Hilbert space. For\nweak coupling to the environment i.e., for small \u03bb, we can\nuse the super-operator formalism7 to obtain the following\nform for the decoherence11 , being the Laplace transform\nof M (t)\nZ \u221e\nM\u0303 (z) = \u2212i\ndt eizt M (t)\n(5)\n0\n\nconstants independent of time, and f (t) a time-varying\nfunction. The resulting self energy in the Laplacian variables then takes the form\n\u03a32 (z) = 2\u03ba + 4\n\n\u22121\n\n(6)\n\n\u03bc\n+ g(z)\nz\n\n(11)\n\nwhere g(z) is some analytic function of z. For the asymptotic decoherence, the first two terms generate oscillations resulting in a decoherence of the form\n\u221a\nM (t) = exp (2i\u03bat) cos (2 \u03bct)M\u0303 (t)\n\n(12)\n\nwhere11\n\nwhere z is a complex variable with Imz > 0. As shown\nin [11], this Laplace transform can be written as\nM\u0303 (z) = [z \u2212 \u03a3(z)]\n\n(3)\n\nln M\u0303 (t) \u2243 \u2212\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\nZ\n\ndE\n\nsin(tE/2)2\n\u03932 (E)\nE2\n\n.\n\n(13)\n\nand\n\nwhere the self-energy \u03a3 up to second order is given by\n\u03a32 (z) = 2Tr(V a \u03c1B ) \u2212\nZ \u221e\ndt eizt [hV a (t)V a ic + hV a V a (t)ic ] (7)\n2i\n0\n\nwhere the connected correlation functions are defined as\nhV a (t)V a ic = hV a V a (t)i \u2212 hV a (t)ihV a i\n\n(8)\n\nThe coherence M can thus be written in terms of the real\nfunctions \u039b2 and \u03932 defined by\n\u039b2 (E) \u2212 i\u03932 (E) = lim+ \u03a32 (E + i\u03b7)\n\u03b7\u21920\n\n(9)\n\nwhere E is real. This then leads to the weak coupling\nresult\nZ\ni\ne\u2212itE\n\u0398(t)M (t) =\n(10)\ndE\n2\u03c0\nE \u2212 \u039b2 (E) + i\u03932 (E)\nwhere \u0398(t) is the Heaviside step function and \u039b2 and \u03932\nsatisfy standard Kramers-Kronig relations. In general,\n\u03932 (E) might have analytic as well as non-analytic parts.\nIt is interesting to note that in the weak coupling limit,\nthe decoherence is essentially dictated by \u03932 (E) which as\ncan be seen from (7) is proportional to the symmetrized\ndynamic structure factor of the bath.\nTypically for spin baths, we encounter situations\nwhere, one can have a net magnetization along a certain spin direction hV a i = \u03ba 6= 0, and/or magnetic ordering where hV a (t)V a ic = \u03bc + f (t) with \u03ba and \u03bc being\n\n\u03932 (E) = [f \u0303(E) + f \u0303(\u2212E)]\n\n(14)\n\nbeing f \u0303 the Fourier transform of the function f (t). (13) is\nalso known as the time-convolutionless projection operator (TCL) approximation26 . The true intermediate time\ndecoherence is expected to be lightly modified with respect to the result predicted by (13), but it is expected to\nbe qualitatively similar to that predicted by (10), which\nis valid for all t. In the absence of any intrinsic dynamics of the central spin, the second order aproximation used here, leads to an equation for the decoherence which resembles that obtained for the spin-boson\nmodel27 . Though (10) is exact for the spin-boson case,\nhere it is valid only in the limit of weak qubit-spinbath\ncoupling. Morevoer, not all spectral densities \u03932 (E) obtained from interacting systems can be simulated by the\nusual non-interacting boson baths.\nFor the disordered systems studied here, the correlation functions (8) and (7) need to be averaged over the\nprobability distributions of both the exchange interactions Jij and the coupling constants \u03bbi . In the rest\nof the paper, the coupling constants \u03bbi in (1) are chosen to have the following disorder averages: \u03bbi = 0 and\n\u03bbi \u03bbj = (\u03bb2 /N )\u03b4ij where N is the total number of spins\nin the bath. This choice leads to the vanishing of the\nfirst order correction to the self energy since the disorder\naverage of \u03ba is zero. The disorder averaged \u03932 , is then\ndirectly related to the connected local spin correlation\nfunctions hV a V a ic , and it is evaluated using the spectral\nrepresentation for the dynamical structure factor\n\n\f4\n\nS aa (E) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\ndt exp (iEt)hV a (t)V a ic\nN\n\nM\nN\n2\n2\u03c0\u03bb2 X 1 X X\n(m)\n(m)\n(m)\nexp (\u2212\u03b2Ej )|hj (m) |Sia |k (m) i|2 \u00d7 \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 Ej + Ek ) \u2212 2\u03c0\u03bb2 m2a \u03b4(E)\n=\nN M m=1 Z (m) i=1\nj,k=1\n\n= 2\u03c0\u03bc\u03b4(E) + f \u0303(E)\n\n(15)\n\nwhere M is the number of realizations of disorder for\nthe exchange interactions Jij and m2a is the disordered\naverage of the square of the local magnetic moment. Our\nmethod for evaluating (15) is presented below.\n\nTo compute \u03932 for the RTIM spin-bath we use exact diagonalization methods. The advantage of the full\ndiagonalization is that it permits us to calculate finite\ntemperature quantities as well. We first study the coherence of the qubit coupled to a random Ising chain bath\ndescribed HB with the external field set to h = 0 , where\nknown analytical results can be used to benchmark the\nimplemented numerical method. The interactions in the\nbath are confined to nearest neighbors on the chain and\nthe spin-bath coupling is taken to be in the a = z direction.\nWe consider baths with the number of spins N varying\nfrom 3 to 10 spins. For a given set of exchange interactions, the resulting hamiltonian which is a 2N \u00d72N matrix\nis exactly diagonalized and the eigenenergies and functions are obtained. These are then used to compute the\ndynamical structure factor and \u03932 (E). Since the interactions are quenched random variables, we repeat the above\nprocedure for several thousands of realization of disorder\nand we obtain the disorder averaged \u03932 . In Fig. 1, we\nplot \u03932 (E) for the case of the Ising bath for different\nsizes of the bath, and fixed temperature T = 0.01\u2206. The\nanalytical results for the thermodynamic case are also\nshown in the graph.\nNote that as the number of spins N in the chain increases, the numerical results converge to the analytical\ncurve obtained for a thermodynamic bath. At high E,\n\u03932 (E) is almost independent of the size of the bath. This\nis due to the fact that the typical energy bonds are of order Jij (O(\u2206)) (independent of the size of the bath),\nwhich are sufficiently small to produce any modification\nin the high energy spectrum. At low energies, size effects\nare most significant, since at finite sizes there are no exact cancellations that lead to the vanishing of \u03932 (E) at\nE = 0. Nevertheless, the spectra shows good uniform\nconvergence as N increases. At higher T , when the thermal energy is higher than the typical energy of the bonds,\nthe convergence is even better and \u03932 (E) is roughly independent of the size of the bath.

A comparison of our\nresults with the analytical results obtained for the infinite\nchain11 permits us to gauge the importance of finite size\neffects. As for the infinite chain case of Ref. 11, the\ndecoherence for the finite chain can also be analyzed in\nterms of three regimes described by the two characteristic\ntimes: t\u2206 = \u2206\u22121 and t\u03b2 = \u03b2 = T \u22121 . At short times, the\ncoherence is\nR given by the universal gaussian, ln M (t) =\n\u2212t2 (2\u03c0)\u22121 dE\u03932 (E), given by the sum rule of \u03932 (E)\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ndE \u03932 (E) = 4\u03c0\u03bb2 /\u2206\n\n(16)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThe asymptotic Markovian regime, where the coherence decays exponentially is characterized by the values\nof \u03932 (E) at E = 0 (for t \u2192 \u221e, ln M (t) \u221d \u2212\u03932 (0)t).\nAt high T , M (t) remains practically constant up to\nt \u2243t\u2206 , where a final Markovian regime arises. When\nT <\n\u223c \u2206, the gaussian regime is followed by an intermediate time regime where the coherence decay as a power\nlaw, before reaching the Markovian regime. A careful inspection of our numerical data shows that, \u03932 (0)\nscales as 1/N 2 (Fig. 3). The extrapolated values of\n\u03932 (0) for N \u2192 \u221e as a function of T are plotted in\nFig. 4, where it can be seen that there is an excellent agreement Rbetween the analytical values given by11\n\u03932 (0) = 2\u03c0\u03bb2 dJP (J)2 (1 \u2212 tanh(\u03b2J)2 ), and the extrapolated values except for T <\n\u223c 0.2\u2206 (inset of Fig. 4).\nAt very small T , since both size effects and temperature\neffects are non negligible at low energies, we surmise that\nthe accessible system sizes are not sufficient to reach the\nscaling regime.\nTo summarize, we see that our numerical method does\nreproduce the expected analytical behavior for the spin\n\nFIG. 4: \u2206\u03bb\u22122 \u03932 (0) (extrapolated to the thermodynamic\nlimit) as a function of T .

Nonetheless, our results reproduce the existence of the different\nregimes. We would like to draw attention to the fact that\nthe benchmark case of the chain is in a sense a worst case\nscenario. In fact, for a 1-d spin-bath one expects to have\nstronger finite size effects compared to the models to be\nstudied in the rest of the paper: i.e., infinite-range models which are known to have much reduced finite size\neffects22,28 .\nBefore leaving this numerical method section we would\nlike to note that our method differs substantially from\nothers that are based on the solution of finite size clusters and cluster expansions. Those methods usually deal\nwith a non-disordered model hamiltonian, which is solved\nfor a small system size. The finite size effects are dealt\nwith by implementing various cluster expansion schemes.\nIn those cases, the finite nature of the cluster provides a\ndiscrete pole structure with a finite low energy cut-off\nand hence a finite recursion time that provides a long\ntime cut-off for the study of the decoherence effects. In\nour case the situation is different. The effect of the bath\nenters through the spin susceptibility, and this quantity\nin a disordered model is computed through the disorder\naverage. Since we have a continuous (Gaussian) distribution of couplings, the disorder-averaged susceptibility,\nthough computed on finite size clusters, does not have\na finite low-energy cut-off. Therefore, the decoherence\ndoes not have a finite recursion time. All the systematic\nerrors in our approach are due to the second order approximation, which is safe so long the coupling between\nthe qubit and the bath is small, and to the finite size of\nthe clusters that are diagonalized to compute the susceptibility of the bath's Hamiltonian. This latter quantity\ncan be, nevertheless, extrapolated to large system sizes,\nas we shall see latter. This is validated by the benchmark\nof the method against an analytically solvable case that\nwe describe in the beginning of next section.\n\n\f6\n\n2.5\n\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n-10\n\n0\nE/\u2206\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n5\n\nFIG. 5: (Color online) \u2206\u03bb\u22122 \u03932 (E) for different values of T\nand N = 9, for the SK bath.

For a gaussian distribution\nwith zero mean of the exchange interactions between the\nspins, the system is paramagnetic except below the spinglass transition temperature T \u2264 Tsg = \u2206 where the\nsystem develops spin glass order. Note that for the infinite range model, extensiveness of the free energy requires as to scale the interactions Jij \u2192 Jij /N . In this\ncase, there is no first order contribution to the self energy and the second order contribution is given directly\nby the full correlation function as opposed to the connected correlation function of (8) i.e., both \u03ba = \u03bc = 0.\nMoreover, \u03932 is proportional to the probability distribution of the local magnetic fields as discussed in Ref. 11.\nThis distribution is straightforward to evaluate analytically in the paramagnetic phase, but numerical methods\nare required to obtain the same in the spin glass phase.\nEarlier work only discussed the evolution of the Markovian rate close to the spin glass transition temperature11 .\nHere, we compute the coherence for all times and find an\nasymptotic Markovian regime at all finite temperatures.\nOur results are shown in Fig. 5 and we see that they\nqualitatively resemble the results obtained for the Ising\nchain. Moreover, our method reproduces known analytical results in the paramagnetic phase and also approaches\nthe expected linear behavior of \u0393 at low frequencies as\nT \u2192 029 .\nThe numerical results for ln M (t) are shown in figure 6.\nAt short times, t <\n\u223c t\u2206 \u2261 1/\u2206, the sum rule obeyed by \u03932\nensures that M (t) decays as a gaussian akin to the free\nspin bath. For times t > t\u2206 , temperature starts playing\na relevant role. At high T > Tsg , since \u03932 (E) is a peak of\nwidth O(\u2206) cf. Fig. 5, M (t) decays as a Markovian for\nall times t \u223c t\u2206 . For T \u226a Tsg , the asymptotic Markovian regime is preceded by a power law regime resulting\nfrom the partial linear behavior of \u03932 (E) for small E.

The\nmodels studied all have infinite range interactions: i.e.,\nall spins interact with each other which leads to the presence of a significant geometric frustration. Similar models have been studied in Ref. 10, where the focus was on\nthe nature of the distribution of the energy level spacings\nand their impact on the decoherence. A standard lore is\nthat thermal fluctuations in the weak coupling regime\nalways leads to a Markovian i.e., exponential decoherence. Here, we will discuss cases, where the decoherence\nremains highly non-Markovian in certain finite temperature paramagnets.\n\nA.\n\n3\n\nMODELS OF SPINS BATHS\n\n\u2206\u03bb \u03932(E)\n\nIV.\n\nT=0.01\u2206\nT=\u2206\nT=10\u2206\nFSB\n\n(a)\n\n0.25\n\n0.5\n\n0.75\n\n1\n\nt\u2206\n\n1.25\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n1.75\nT=0.01\u2206\nT=\u2206\nT=10\u2206\nFSB\n\n(b)\n\n5\n\n10\nt\u2206\n\n15\n\n20\n\nFIG. 6: (Color online) (\u2206/\u03bb)2 ln M (t) for the SK bath and\nthe comparison with the free spin-bath (FSB); (a) for short\ntimes, where it can be seen that at T = \u2206, there's a change\nof the curvature in ln M (t); (b) for long times.\n\nT \u2192 0, this intermediate power law regime is expected\nto extend to the asymptotic regime.

Extrapolating\nthe results of \u03932 (0) to the limit of N \u2192 \u221e to obtain\nthe Markovian decay rate in the thermodynamic limit,\nwe find that \u03932 (0) scales 1/N cf. Fig. 7 (instead of the\n1/N 2 scaling in the Ising chain). The resulting Markovian rate is plotted as a function of T in Fig. 8, and\nperfectly matches the analytical values predicted in [11]\nin the PM-phase.

At T = 0, the system undergoes a phase transition from a spin glass state for\nh \u2264 hc \u2243 1.44\u2206 to a gapped phase for h \u2265 hc . As\ntemperature is increased, the spin glass phase disappears\nat a finite temperature which depends on the value of\nthe magnetic field. The magnetic field h is therefore, expected to deeply influence the behavior of \u03932 (E), and\nhence the coherence of the central spin. Since the model\nis not isotropic, it is important to note that the spin glass\norder exists only along the x component of the spin. To\nprobe the physical ramifications of this anisotropy, we\nexamine two different couplings of the central spin to the\nbath: a coupling of the spin operators in the direction\nof the field (a = z) and a coupling perpendicular to the\nfield (a = x). As we will show below, these lead to radically different predictions for the decoherence. Previous\nnumerical studies22 of this model have shown finite size\neffects to be rather minimal. Given the numerical complexities in the vicinity of the phase transition, we limit\nthe scope of the present study to consider two values of\nthe field h = 0.1hc and h = 2hc , that set the system in\nqualitatively different regimes.\n\nNumerical extrapolation\nPM Analytic\n\n0.5\n0\n0\n\nSherrington-Kirkpatrick model in a transverse\nfield h 6= 0\n\n1.\n2\n\n4\nT/\u2206\n\n6\n\n8\n\nFIG. 8: \u2206\u03bb\u22122 \u03932 (0) (extrapolated to the thermodynamic\nlimit) as a function of T for the SK bath. The dashed curve\nrepresents the analytical results in the paramagnetic phase.\n\nAs in the case of the Ising chain, we find that interactions between the spins do lead to longer coherence times\nas opposed to the case of a free spin bath. The only visible effect of the spin glass phase transition is the point of\ninflexion in the curvature of ln M (t) for t \u2243 t\u2206 when the\nasymptotic Markovian regime takes over. This curvature\nis negative for T > Tsg and positive for T < Tsg . The\nabsence of a radical change in the decoherence is not surprising since the qubit does not couple to the operator\nwhich corresponds to the spin glass order parameter.\nIn the following section, we study the RTIM which\nis known to have both, a quantum phase transition at\nT = 0, and a finite temperature classical phase transition. We study two different couplings between the qubit\nand the bath spin operators and show that the nature of\nthese couplings has highly non-trivial consequences for\nthe decoherence.\n\nCoupling parallel to the field (case a = z)\n\nSince a magnetic moment is present in the z direction\nfor h 6= 0, the \u03932 (E) is given by the full connected correlation function (8). As shown in (15), this contributes\na singular term \u221d \u03bc\u03b4(E) to \u03932 (E) which then leads to\noscillations in M (t) (equation 12). An unambiguous way\nto extract the coefficient \u03bc is via the sum rule satisfied\nby the dynamical structure factor22 . This, however, is\nnumerically cumbersome and in the rest of the paper,\nwe do not deal explicitly with these singular terms, since\nthey only induce oscillations and instead concentrate on\nthe non singular part of \u03932 (E) that leads to a decay of\nthe coherence. The T = 0 behavior of \u03932 (E) when a\nsmall field h= 0.1hc is applied is shown in figure 9. We\nnote that even for such small fields, \u03932 (E) is radically\ndifferent from the earlier case of h = 0.\nOur results for \u03932 (E) obtained for N = 9 are shown in\nFigs. 9 and 10, for the small and large field case respectively.

At high T , \u03932 (E) shows a pronounced peak\naround E \u2243 \u00b10.1h and broader peaks of width \u2248 4\u2206 in\nthe background.

Note however, that in\nthe high field case the \u03b4(E) term arising from moment\nformation carries most of the spectral weight at T = 0,\nas the spectral weight of the regular part of \u03932 (E) decreases dramatically. The principal difference between\nthe high and low field case is the presence of the sharp\npeak around E \u223c 2h in the low field case. We have studied the finite size scaling of \u03932 (E) and we find that the\nfeatures mentioned above are robust to finite size effects.\nMoreover, contrary to the previous cases, here we obtain\na good convergence with system size in the low frequency\nregime.\nInterestingly, our results bely the naive expectation\nthat the behavior in the high temperature paramagnetic\nphase be independent of the values of h considered here.\nThis can be attributed to the fundamental difference between the structure of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues in\nthe two cases: for h = 0.1hc, they correspond to that of a\nspinglass system, while the high field case essentially correspond to spins in a strong field where the interactions\nbetween the spins can be viewed as a perturbation. At\nhigh enough temperatures, all eigenfunctions and eigenvalues contribute equally to the \u03932 (E) thus the large T\nregime actually reveals the \"geometric\" underlying structure of the Hamiltonian, rather than a naively expected\nuniversal paramagnetic regime of free spins. This observation remains relevant for all the different spin-models\nanalyzed in this work.\nThe results for \u03932 (E) indicate a very rich evolution\nof the coherence of the central spin, particularly at long\ntimes. We first analyze the results for M (t) plotted in\nFigs. 11 (high T ) and 12 (low T ), for h = 0.1hc . As\nbefore, for t <\n\u223ct\u2206 , the sum rule obeyed by \u03932 (E) (16)\ndictates an universal gaussian decay for the decoherence,\nindependently of h, \u2206 and T .

The free spin case (FSB) is\nalso plotted for reference.\n\nis plotted in figure 13 various T . As in the case for h = 0,\nnot dramatic change is seen as one traverses the spin glass\ntransition temperature. The existence of an asymptotic\npower law regime at finite temperatures completely defies\nthe conventional lore that the asymptotic decoherence\nat finite temperatures is Markovian18,19 . A systematic\nanalysis of our numerical results indicates that for low\nfields, tp is an increasing function of temperature. This\nimplies that in the high temperature paramagnetic phase,\nthe power law regime is pushed to ultra long times and\nthe decoherence is Markovian for realistic times. Though\nthe exact values of tp and tm are subject to finite size\neffects, we have studied various system sizes and find\nthat the intermediate Markovian and power law regimes\nwill survive in the thermodynamic limit.\nBefore moving on to the high magnetic field case, we\nshall present an intuitive physical picture of the very low\n\nfield case. We first recall the physical picture of the spinglass ground state at T = 0 and h = 0, that was discussed\nin the numerical investigation of Ref. 22. There it was\nargued that the spin system can be viewed as a coexisting\ncollection of large non-frustrated clusters of spins with\nfew remnant strongly frustrated \"dangling\" spins. Thus,\nthe dangling spins experience a distribution of effective\nmagnetic fields heff which, from the work of Sherrington\nand Kirkpatrick is known to have a linear distribution.\nThis linear is directly reflected in the \u03932 (E) \u223c |E| that\nwe discussed before.\nNow, when a small external magnetic field is turned\non, the unfrustrated spins of the clusters will remain essentially unaffected. In contrast, the dangling spins will\nalign in the direction of max(heff , h). This means that\nthe finite external field h will act as a low frequency cutoff, pushing spectral weight towards higher frequencies\nand thus opening an h-controlled gap in \u03932 (E) around\nE = 0 (see the low-T curve of the right inset of Fig. 9).\nThis behavior is in stark contrast with the reference case\nh = 0 presented in section IV A where \u03932 (E) remains\nalways gapless (Fig. 5). The dramatic change in the low\nE regime implies also the qualitative change in the long\ntime behavior of the decoherence that we described in\nthe previous section.\nThis line of argumentation also allows us to qualitatively understand the origin of the linearity of \u03932 (E) at\nhigh T . In this limit, from (15) we see that all eigenvalues and eigenfunctions contribute to \u03932 (E). On the other\nhand, when h = 0, the data of Fig. 5 shows that \u03932 (E)\nis finite as E \u2192 0, so there are plenty of contributions\nat arbitrary low frequencies, which originate in pairs of\nquasi-degenerate eigenstates |ni and |mi with eigenenergies En \u2248 Em , which also have a non-vanishing matrix\nelement sznm = hn|\u03c3iz |mi. When a small external field ( h\n\u226a hc ) is turned on we may consider it as a perturbation\nan perform the following qualitative analysis: The (2x2)\nblock of H in the subspace of n and m will read:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nEo hsznm\nHnm =\nhsznm Eo\nwhere Eo is the quasi-degenerate energy of the states.\nThe effect of the small h is to lift the degeneracy of the\npair of levels resulting in a transfer of spectral weight\nfrom E \u2248 0 to higher frequencies. Extending the analysis to all pairs of quasi-degenerate states contributing to\n\u03932 (E) implies the immediate collapse of the finite value\nof \u03932 (E = 0) to zero when h6= 0, as is seen in our results\nof Fig. 14. Moreover, the new eigenvalues of Hnm are\n\u2248 \u00b1hsznm , thus with the reasonable assumption of a featureless distribution of the sznm matrix elements, we conclude that the degeneracy lifting is uniformly distributed\nand directly proportional to h. This implies that the behavior of \u03932 (E) at very low frequencies should be linear\nin E with a slope roughly given by 1/h. This analysis is\nin qualitative agreement with the low field data shown in\nFig. 14.\nAt high magnetic fields (Fig. 15), the coherence\n\n\f10\n5\n\n150\n1\n\nh=0\nh=0.05hc\nh=0.1hc\nh=0.2hc\n\n4\n\n0.01\n\n0\n-0.1\n\n2\n\n0.005\n\n100\n(\u2206/\u03bb) \u03b5\n\n30\n0\n\n\u22122\n\n\u2206\u03bb \u03932(E)\n\n2\n\n2\n\nT=\u2206\nT=2\u2206\nT=4\u2206\nT=6\u2206\nT=10\u2206\n\n\u22122\n\n4\n\n\u2206\u03bb \u03932(E)\n\nincreasing h\n\n-0.05\n\n0\nE/\u2206\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n50\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1e-05 0.0001 0.001\n\n0.01\nE/\u2206\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\nFIG. 14: (Color online) \u2206\u03bb\u22122 \u03932 (E) as a function of E for\ndifferent values of the field h with N = 9 and T = 10\u2206.\nInset: linear behavior of \u03932 (E) for low energies.\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n(\u2206/\u03bb) ln M(t)\n\n-50\n0\n\n-100\nT=0\n\n-150\n\nT=3\u2206\nT=10\u2206\n\n-200\n0\n\n100\n\n-0.002\n\n0\n\n200 t\u2206 300\n\n5\n\n400\n\n500\n\n2\n\n(\u2206/\u03bb) ln M(t)\n\n0\n-50\n\nT=3\u2206\nT=10\u2206\n\n-100\n-150\n-200\n\n1\n\n10 t\u2206\n\n100\n\nFIG. 15: (Color online) (\u2206/\u03bb)2 ln M (t) as a function of time\nfor h= 2hc . For low T , since \u03932 (E) is gaped, the decoherence\nis very weak and shows oscillations (inset). As T increases,\nthe coherence decays asymptotically as a power law.\n\npresents a different qualitative behavior. At low T , since\n\u03932 (E) is nearly gapped, and most of the spectral weight\nis in the \u03b4(E) term, the central spin decoherence is very\nweak and shows oscillations. At high T , in contrast to\nthe low h behavior, there is no well defined intermediate Markovian regime, but we recover a power-law decay\n(M (t) \u221d t\u2212\u01eb ) at asymptotic times. This coefficient \u01eb,\nwhich characterizes the power law decay, increases with\nT and saturates to a finite value at very high temperatures, proving that the qubit decoheres faster as temperature increases. The value of the exponent \u01eb extrapolated\nto the thermodynamic limit, as a function of T , is shown\nin figure 16.\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nT/\u2206\n\nFIG. 16: The exponent \u01eb (M (t) \u221d t\u2212\u01eb ) extrapolated to the\nthermodynamic limit, as a function of T for h = 2hc .\n\n2.\n0\n\n2\n\nCoupling transverse to the field (case a = x)\n\nWe now explore the case where the qubit couples directly to the bath operator which is related to the spin\nglass order parameter. In the spin-glass part of the phase\n2\ndiagram (h \u2264 hc ), we now have h\u03c3xi i = 0 and h\u03c3xi i 6= 0\n\u2200i. As in Sec. IV B 1, \u03932 (E) is again a sum of a regular and a singular contribution. The singular part is a\n\u03b4(E) contribution whose strength is related to the spin\nglass order parameter P\nor Edwards Anderson parameter\ni 2\nqEA , \u0393NR\n=\n(4\u03c0q\n\u2212\nEA\n2\ni h\u03c3x i )\u03b4(E). The non-regular\npart induces oscillations in M (t) and the regular part results in the decay of M (t) (13). The estimation of qEA\nis a central problem in spin-glasses and as expected our\nnumerics do not produce well converged results of the\nvalues of this parameter. qEA is typically estimated by\nsystematically studying \u03932 (E) for different sizes of the\nsystem, as in Ref. 22. Though it is reasonably straightforward to estimate qEA at T = 0, this is not the case at\nfinite temperatures where the delta peak is broadened by\nboth finite size effects and thermal excitations.22\nWhen h = 0, the operator V x is constant of motion\nsince [HB , V x ] = 0 resulting in a temperature independent \u0393(E) = 4\u03c0\u03bb2 \u2206\u22121 \u03b4(E). As discussed in Sec. II,\nthis results in a purely oscillatory behavior of the form\nM (t) = cos(2\u03bb\u2206\u22121 t).When the field h is turned on, spin\nflips are allowed, [HB , V x ] 6= 0 and \u03932 (E) has a richer\nstructure. For small h (h \u226a hc ) and T = 0, in addition\nto a \u03b4(E) term \u03932 (E) has a regular part \u0393R (E) \u221d |E|\nas E \u2192 0 and has a peak of width 4\u2206, centered around\nE = 2h22 . As temperature is increased, since qEA is expected to decrease, a part of the spectral weight of the\n\u03b4(E) term is transferred to the regular part \u0393R which is\nnow nonlinear at low energies (Fig. 17).\nWe can now construct a picture of the coherence in the\nspin-glass phase based on the above description of \u03932 (E).\nThe short time behavior is governed by a gaussian.

As in the\nzero-field case, the linearity of \u03932 (E) as E \u2192 0 leads to\na power-law asymptotic decay of the coherence. At finite temperatures, we expect the asymptotic decay to be\nMarkovian.\nFor high h (h > hc ), there is no spin glass order and\nhence no singular contribution to \u03932 (E). At T = 0, the\nfunction \u03932 (E) is gaped, and it is centered in E = \u00b12hc ,\nwith a width of \u223c 4\u2206. As T is increased, thermal excitations appear within the gap (Fig. 17). Thus, in the\nformer case the decoherence is partial (Fig. 18) and we\nsee oscillations with a frequency given by the gap size.\nAs T increases, thermal excitations start to fill the gap\nand M (t) decays in a Markovian way given by the value\nof \u03932 (0). This behavior conforms to the usual expectations of asymptotic Markovian decay at finite temperatures and is very different from the small h case.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper, we have used exact diagonalization\nmethods to study the decoherence of a central spin induced by spinbaths with random interactions. We find\nthat the asymptotic decoherence is intricately linked with\nthe nature of the interactions in the bath. Moreover, for\na given set of bath parameters, the decoherence crucially\ndepends on the nature of the coupling between the qubit\nand the bath spins. For the cases of the random transverse Ising model studied here, we find that the underlying nature of the eigenstates of the bath hamiltonian\nplay a preponderant role in determining the decoherence\neven in the finite temperature paramagnetic phase. More\nprecisely, we find that the decoherence in some of the\nfinite temperature paramagnetic phases is strongly nonMarkovian. We emphasize that standard Markovian approximations used to obtain the density matrix and the\ndecoherence at finite temperatures should not be used\nblindly as they can lead to highly misleading results as in\nthe present case of disordered interacting systems. Unfortunately, we have not been able to study the decoherence\nin the vicinity of the phase transitions in the bath ( both\nat zero and finite temperatures). This requires the use of\nother numerical and analytical methods which is beyond\nthe scope of the present work. It will be interesting to\nstudy if these features are seen in other highly frustrated\nspin baths and whether this non-Markovian behavior survives when order corrections to the self-energy are taken\ninto account. These questions are left for future work.\nWe would like to thank S. Camalet for interesting discussions. One of us R.C. acknowledges support from the\nInstitut Universitaire de France.\n\n2\n\nD.
