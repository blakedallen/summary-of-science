Sidharth\nInternational Institute for Applicable Mathematics & Information Sciences\nHyderabad (India) & Udine (Italy)\nB.M. Birla Science Centre, Adarsh Nagar, Hyderabad - 500 063 (India)\nAbstract\nThe author's work over the past years has indicated that the photon has a small mass \u223c 10\u221233 eV . Recent observations from three\ndifferent viewpoints \u2013 the time lag in cosmic gamma rays with different frequencies, the observation of the spectra of blazars and an\nanalysis of the CMB power supression from the WMAP data \u2013 all\nvindicate this conclusion and remarkably, the same value.\n\n1\n\nPhoton Mass\n\nAs is well known the concept of the photon grew out of the work of Planck\nand Einstein, though its earliest origin was in Newton's Corpuscular Theory.\nThereafter the photon got integrated into twentieth century physics, be it\nClassical or Quantum. Though it is considered to be a massless particle of\nspin 1 and 2 helicity states (as proved later for any massless particle with spin\nby Wigner), it is interesting to note that there had been different dissenting\nviews with the photon being endowed with a small mass.\nAn apparent objection to this view has been that a photon mass would be\nincompatible with Special Relativity. However it is interesting to note that\nnowhere in twentieth century physics has it been proved that the photon\nindeed has no mass [1]. Furthermore we are lead to the fact that there is\na minimum mass in the universe from two different points of view. Firstly\nfrom Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle we have\nmc2 * T \u223c h\u0304\n1\n\n(1)\n\n\fIf T is the age of the universe \u223c 1017 sec, then (1) gives\nm \u223c 10\u221265 gm = 10\u221233 eV\n\n(2)\n\nFrom the author's Planck oscillator underpinning theory too we arrive at\nexactly the minimum mass given in (2) [2].\nThere is another simple way of arriving at (2). We model the dark energy by\na background electromagnetic field which is an infinite collection of independent oscillators, with amplitudes X1 , X2 etc. The probability for the various\noscillators to have amplitudes X1 , X2 and so on is the product of individual\noscillator amplitudes:\n\u03c8(X1 , X2 , * * *) = exp[\u2212(X12 + X22 + * * *)]\nwherein there would be a suitable normalization factor. This expression gives\nthe probability amplitude \u03c8 for a configuration B(x, y, z) of the magnetic field\nthat is described by the Fourier coefficients X1 , X2 , * * * or directly in terms\nof the magnetic field configuration itself by, as we saw,\n\u03c8(B(x, y, z)) = P exp \u2212\n\nZ Z\n\n!\n\nB(x1 ) * B(x2 ) 3\nd x1 d3 x2 .\n2\n16\u03c0 3h\u0304cr12\n\nP being a normalization factor. At this stage, we are thinking in terms of\nenergy without differentiation, that is, without considering Electromagnetism\nor Gravitation etc as separate. Let us consider a configuration where the\nmagnetic field is everywhere zero except in a region of dimension l, where it\nis of the order of \u223c \u2206B. The probability amplitude for this configuration\nwould be proportional to\nexp[\u2212((\u2206B)2 l4 /h\u0304c)]\nSo the energy of fluctuation in a region of length l is given by finally as is\nwell known, the density (Cf.ref.[5]),\nB2 \u223c\n\nh\u0304c\nl4\n\nSo the energy content in a region of volume l3 is given by\n\u03b2 2 \u223c h\u0304c/l\n2\n\n(3)\n\n\fThis energy is minimum when l in (3) is maximum. Let us take l to be\nthe radius of the Universe \u223c 1028 cms. The minimum energy residue of the\nbackground dark energy now turns out to be exactly the value in (2), which\nas we will see has indeed experimental confirmation.\nWhile it would be tempting to identify the photon mass with (2), it would\nbe correct to say that there are a number of experimental upper limits to the\nmass of the photon as we will see. These limits have become more and more\nprecise [3, 4]. The best limit so far is given by\nm\u03b3 < 10\u221257 gm\n\n(4)\n\nthat is, the photon mass would be very small indeed!\n\n2\n\nTheoretical Support\n\nThe author has argued from different points of view to show that the photon\nhas a mass given by (2) [5, 6, 7]. We now touch upon yet another theoretical\nindicator [8].\nWe first observe that as is well known [9], Maxwell's equations can be written\nin the following form\n~ + \u0131B,\n~\n\u03a8=E\n(5)\n~ \u00d7 \u03a8 = \u0131\u03a8\u0307\n\u2207\n\n(6)\n\n~ *\u03a8=0\n\u2207\n\n(7)\n\nEquations (5) to (7) will be useful in the sequel.\nWe next observe that Maxwell's equations have been deduced in a fashion\nvery similar to the Dirac equation, from first principles [10]. In this deduction, we use the usual energy momentum relation for the photon\nE 2 \u2212 p 2 c2 = 0\nand introduce matrices given by\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n0 0 \u0131\n0 0 0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nSx = \uf8ed 0 0 \u2212 \u0131 \uf8f8 , Sy = \uf8ed 0 0 0 \uf8f8 ,\n\u2212\u0131 0 0\n0 \u0131 0\n3\n\n\f\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n1 0 0\n0 \u2212\u0131 0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n(3)\n=\uf8ed 0 1 0 \uf8f8,\nSz = \uf8ed \u0131 0 0\n\uf8f8 ,I\n0 0 1\n0 0 0\n\n(8)\n\nfrom which we get\n\nE2\nE (3)\n\u2212 p2 \u03a8 =\nI +p*S \u03a8\n2\nc\nc\n!\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\npx\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\u2212 \uf8ed py \uf8f8 (p * \u03a8) = 0,\npz\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03a8 is a three component wave function and in general bold letters\ndenote vector quantities.\nEquation (9) implies\n\u0012\n\u0013\nE (3)\nI + p * S \u03a8 = 0,\n(10)\nc\np * \u03a8 = 0,\n(11)\nwhere S is given in (8). There is also an equation for \u03a8\u2217 namely\n\u0012\n\nE (3)\nI \u2212 p * S \u03a8\u2217 = 0,\nc\n\u0013\n\n(12)\n\np * \u03a8\u2217 = 0,\n\n(13)\n\nIt is then easy to verify (Cf.ref.[10]) that with the substitution of the usual\nQuantum Mechanical energy momentum operators, we recover equations (5)\nto (7) for \u03a8 and its complex conjugate.\nRecently a similar analysis has lead to the same conclusion. In fact it has\nbeen shown that under a Lorentz boost [11, 12, 13],\n\u03a8\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03a8\u2217\n\n!\n\n\uf8eb\n\n=\uf8ed\n\n1\u2212\n0\n\n(S*p)\nmc\n\n(S*p)2\n0\nm(E+mc2 )\n(S*p)2\n1 + (S*p)\n+ m(E+mc\n2)\nmc\n\n+\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\n\u03a8\n\u03a8\u2217\n\n!\n\n(14)\n\nWe would like to point out that equations (6), (7), (10) to (14) display the\nsymmetry\np \u2192 \u2212p , \u03a8 \u2192 \u03a8\u2217\n\n4\n\n\fWe now invoke the Weinberg-Tucker-Hammer formalism (Cf.[13]) which gives,\nfor a Lorentz boost, the equations\n\u03c6\u2032R\n\u03c6\u2032L\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(15)\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(16)\n\nS*p\n= 1+\n+ (S * p)2 m(E + m) \u03c6R ,\nm\nS*p\n= 1\u2212\n+ (S * p)2 m(E + m) \u03c6L ,\nm\n\nwhere the subscripts R and L refer to the states of opposite helicity, that is\nleft and right polarised light in our case.\nWe observe that equations (14) and (15)-(16) are identical, but there is a\ncurious feature in both of these, that is that the photon of electromagnetism\nis now seen to have a mass m.\n\n3\n\nThe Experimental Scene\n\n(i) Nevertheless there are experimental tests, in addition to those mentioned\nabove, which are doable. It is well known that for a massive vector field\ninteracting with a magnetic dipole of moment M, for example the earth\nitself, we would have with the usual notation (Cf.ref.[4])\n\u0131\nA(x) =\n2\n\nZ\n\ne\u0131k,x\nd3 k\ne\u2212\u03bcr\nM\n\u00d7\nk\n=\n\u2212M\n\u00d7\n\u2207\n(2\u03c0)3\nk2 + \u03bc2\n8\u03c0r\n\n!\n\ne\u2212\u03bcr\n1\n2\nB=\n(17)\n|M| r\u0302(r\u0302 * \u1e91) \u2212 \u1e91 (\u03bc2 r 2 + 3\u03bcr + 3) \u2212 \u1e91\u03bc2 r 2\n3\n8\u03c0r\n3\n3\nConsiderations like this have yielded as noted in the past an upper limit for\nthe photon mass, for instance 10\u221248 gms and 10\u221257 gms. Nevertheless (17)\ncan be used for a precise determination of the photon mass.\n(ii) With a non zero photon mass we would have, for radiation (Cf.ref.[5])\n\u001a\u0014\n\n\u001b\n\n\u0015\n\nE = h\u03bd = m\u03bd c2 [1 \u2212 v\u03b32 /c2 ]\u22121/2\n\n(18)\n\nFrom (18) one would have a dispersive group velocity for waves of frequency\n\u03bd given by (Cf. also ref.[14])\nm2 c4\nv\u03b3 = c 1 \u2212 2\u03b3 2\nh\u03bd\n\"\n\n5\n\n#1/2\n\n(19)\n\n\fWe would like to point out that (19) indicates that higher frequency radiation has a velocity greater than lower frequency radiation. This is a very\nsubtle and minute effect and is best tested in for example, the observation of\nhigh energy gamma rays, which we receive from deep outer space. It is quite\nremarkable that we may already have witnessed this effect\u2013 higher frequency\ncomponents of gamma rays in cosmic rays do indeed seem to reach earlier\nthan their lower frequency counterparts [15].\n(iii) Another test for the massive photon comes from the observations of De\nAngeles and co-workers of the MAGIC Telescope team. They have observed\nan inexplicably large transparency to gamma rays, by using the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope and MAGIC. Their conclusion is that this\nanomalous observation can be reconciled with standard blazar emission models provided the photon oscillates to a Light Axion like Particle (ALP) in\nextra galactic magnetic fields. The ALP again has the very same mass of\n10\u221265 gms(10\u221233 eV ). These considerations have been successfully applied to\nthe Blazar 3C279 [16].\n(iv) A further confirmation for exactly the same photon mass comes from\nthe observation of a small residual energy at the edge of the universe, recently [17, 18]: There has been a wealth of data from the WMAP. One of the\nintriguing findings is that the dark energy domination and the CMB power\nsupression, both occur around the same red shift and energy scale - corresponding to the energy scale of the Hubble radius \u223c 10\u221233 eV exactly the\nsame minimum energy as before in (2).\n\n4\n\nRemarks\n\n1. De Broglie himself [19] believed that the photon has a mass, a view shared\nby a few others as well. Interestingly in this context in 1940 and 1942, De\nBroglie published two volumes on the Theory of Light, La mecanique ondulatoire du photon Une nouvelle theorie de la lumiere, the first volume, La\nlumiere dans le vide (Paris, Hermann, 1940); the second volume, Les interactions entre les photons et la matiere (Paris, Hermann, 1942) [20, 21].\n2. Laboratory diffraction experiments several years ago indicated a photon\nmass similar to (2), showing that the vacuum is a dissipative medium [14].\n3. In fact if we start with the Langevin equation in a viscous medium then as\nthe viscosity becomes vanishingly small, it turns out that the Brownian particle moves according to Newton's first law, that is with a constant velocity.\n6\n\n\fMoreover this constant velocity is given by, for any mass m,\nhv 2 i =\n\nkT\nm\n\n(20)\n\nWe would like to study the case where m \u2192 0. Then so too should T for a\nmeaningful limit. More realistically, let us consider (20) with minimal values\nof T and m, in the real world. We consider in the Beckenstein-Hawking\nBlack Hole temperature formula the entire Universe so that the mass M is\n\u223c 1055 gms. The justification for this is that the Universe mimics a black\nhole, as shown in detail several years ago by the author. This can be seen\nin a simple way by the fact that the size of the Universe is given by the\nSchwarzchild radius:\n2GM\nR\u2248\nc2\nFurther the time taken by light to reach the boundary at a distance R from\na given point is the same as for a black hole of the mass of the Universe.\nSubstitution gives\n104\n(21)\nT = 32 \u223c 10\u221228 K\n10\nWe next consider in (20),m to be the smallest possible mass encountered\nearlier, viz.,\nm \u223c 10\u221265 gms\n(22)\nEquation (22) has been obtained as we saw from different points of view,\ne.g. the Planck scale underpinning for the Universe. Substitution of (21)\nand (22) in (20) gives\nhv 2 i =\n\nkT\n10\u221216 \u00d7 10\u221228\n=\n= 1021 , i.e.\nm\n10\u221265\nv = c (cm/sec)\n\n(23)\n\nWe can see from (20) and (23) that the velocity c is the velocity of light!
