Recently, the M1 transition strengths are of\ninterest from the view points of not only nuclear physics but also neutrino astrophysics because the spin part of the M1 operator is identical with the relevant operators mediating\nneutrino-induced reactions.\nRaghavan et al. pointed out that the\n\n11\n\nB isotope can be used as a possible neutrino\n\ndetector to investigate stellar processes [1]. High-energy neutrinos emitted from the stellar\nprocesses like the proton-proton fusion chain in the sun and the supernova explosions excite\nlow-lying states in\n\n11\n\nB and\n\n11\n\nC by M1 and Gamow-Teller (GT) transitions via the neutral-\n\ncurrent (NC) and charged-current (CC) processes as seen in Fig. 1. Such neutrinos are detected by measuring emitted electrons from CC reactions and \u03b3 rays from the de-excitations\nof the low-lying states. Since both the NC and CC reactions can be simultaneously measured with one experimental setup using an isospin symmetrical relation between the\n\n11\n\nB\n\nand 11 C, the systematic uncertainty in measuring a ratio of the electron-neutrino flux to the\nentire neutrino flux is expected to be small. Since the isospin of the ground state of\nT = 1/2, low-lying states in\n\n11\n\n11\n\nB is\n\nB are excited by both the isovector and isoscalar transitions.\n\nTherefore, both the isovector and isoscalar responses are needed for estimating the NC cross\nsection. Bernab\u00e9u et al. estimated the CC and NC cross sections for the several low-lying\nstates in\n\n11\n\nB and\n\n11\n\nC [2]. They obtained the transition strength for the 1/2\u2212\n1 state from the\n\navailable experimental data in a model-independent way. However, the estimations for the\nother states rely on the shell-model calculation due to the lack of experimental data. Thus,\nthe measurement of the M1 strengths for such states in the A = 11 system is still important.\nIn addition to the nuclear response, the coupling constants for the weak interaction\nprocesses are required for estimating the cross sections of the neutrino-induced reactions.\nAlthough the axial isovector coupling constant is well-determined as gA = 1.254 \u00b1 0.006, the\naxial isoscalar coupling constant fA remains to be uncertain. The value of fA directly relates\nto the strange quark polarization of nucleon. The EMC experiment reported fA = 0.19\u00b10.06\n[3], but another experiment at SLAC presented a smaller value of fA = 0.12 \u00b1 0.02 [4]. This\ndiscrepancy stems from a difficulty in the deep inelastic scattering measurement to cover\na small-x region. It is noteworthy that the strange quark polarization and fA become\n3\n\n\fattainable by measuring neutrino-nucleus inelastic scattering with a neutrino beam if the\nnuclear response is precisely determined.\nThe cross sections for hadronic reactions at forward scattering angles have a good proportionality to the relevant transition matrix elements. The cross section for the (3 He, t)\nreaction can be written in terms of the GT\u2212 operator. On the other hand, the cross section\nfor the (d, d\u2032) can be described by an isoscalar M1 operator. The cross section for the (p, p\u2032)\nreaction is described by a coherent sum of the isovector and isoscalar M1 operators. It is,\nin principle, possible to obtain the GT and M1 strengths by comparing the (3 He, t), (d, d\u2032),\nand (p, p\u2032 ) cross sections. In this article, we report the results on the GT and M1 strengths\nobtained from three experiments on the\n\nII.\n\n11\n\nB(3 He, t),\n\n11\n\nB(d, d\u2032 ), and\n\n11\n\nB(p, p\u2032) reactions.\n\nGT AND M1 TRANSITION OPERATORS\n\nThe GT and M1 transition operators are written by\nA\n\n1X\n\u03c3 k \u03c4\u00b1 (k)\n2 k=1\n#\n\" Z\nN\nX\nX\n(gl\u03bd lk + gs\u03bd sk ) \u03bcN\n(gl\u03c0 lk + gs\u03c0 sk ) +\n\u00d4(M1) =\n\n\u00d4(GT\u00b1 ) =\n\nk=1\n\nk=1\n\n=\n\n\" A \u0012\nX g\u03c0 + g\u03bd\nl\n\nk=1\n\n(1)\n\nl\n\n2\n\ng \u03c0 + gs\u03bd \u03c3 k\nlk + s\n2\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2212\n\n\u0012\n\ngl\u03c0 \u2212 gl\u03bd\ng \u03c0 \u2212 gs\u03bd \u03c3 k\nlk + s\n2\n2\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n#\n\n\u03c4z (k) \u03bcN , (2)\n\nwhere \u03bcN is the nuclear magneton. For protons and neutrons in the free space, the orbital\nand spin gyromagnetic factors are gl\u03c0 = 1, gl\u03bd = 0, gs\u03c0 = 5.586, and gs\u03bd = \u22123.826, respectively.\nThese gyromagnetic factors might be effectively modified in the nuclear medium. The eigen\nvalues for the isospin operator \u03c4z are defined as +1 for neutrons and \u22121 for protons. Using\nthe GT and M1 transition operators, the GT and M1 transition strengths are given by\n2\n\n2\n1\n1\n1\nhf k\u00d4(GT\u00b1 )kii =\nM(\u03c3\u03c4\u00b1 ) ,\n2Ji + 1\n2Ji + 1 2\n2\n3\n1\nhf k\u00d4(M1)kii\nB(M1) =\n2Ji + 1 4\u03c0\n2\n1\ng IS\n3 IS\ng IV\n=\ngl M(l) + s M(\u03c3) + glIV M(l\u03c4z ) + s M(\u03c3\u03c4z ) \u03bc2N ,\n2Ji + 1 4\u03c0\n2\n2\n\nB(GT\u00b1 ) =\n\nwhere\nIS\ngl(s)\n=\n\n\u03c0\n\u03bd\ngl(s)\n+ gl(s)\n\n2\n\n,\n\nIV\ngl(s)\n=\n\n\u03c0\n\u03bd\ngl(s)\n\u2212 gl(s)\n\n2\n4\n\n,\n\nM(\u00d4) = hf k\u00d4kii.\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n\fJi is the spin of the initial nuclei. The convention for the reduced matrix elements is\naccording to that of Edmonds [5]. The M1 transition strengths consist of the isovector\nand isoscalar parts, and each of them stems from the orbital and spin contributions. The\ngyromagnetic factor for the isoscalar spin term is estimated to be gsIS = 0.880 from the freenucleon values, which is much smaller than that for the isovector spin term gsIV = \u22124.706\nin the magnitude. Thus, the isoscalar spin contribution for the M1 transition strength is 29\ntimes smaller than the isovector contribution. This means that electro-magnetic probes are\ninsensitive to the isoscalar spin part. To obtain the isoscalar spin part, therefore, hadronic\nprobes are useful.\nIn the case of proton and deuteron scattering off nuclei at forward angles, the spin part of\nthe M1 transition strength is dominant. The isovector and isoscalar spin-flip M1 strengths\nare defined by\n1\n3\n|M(\u03c3\u03c4z )|2 ,\n2Ji + 1 16\u03c0\n3\n1\n|M(\u03c3)|2 .\nB(\u03c3) =\n2Ji + 1 16\u03c0\n\nB(\u03c3\u03c4z ) =\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\nThere is a simple relation between the isovector spin-flip M1 strength and the GT strength\nfor the analog transition to the mirror nucleus under the assumption of the isospin symmetry,\nB(GT\u00b1 )\n8\u03c0 hTi , Tiz , 1, \u00b11|Tf , Tf z i2\n=\n.\n(8)\nB(\u03c3\u03c4z )\n3 hTi , Tiz , 1, 0|Tf , Tf z i2\nAlthough the isospin-symmetry breaking changes this ratio, the deviation is usually small.\nTherefore, the GT strengths obtained from the charge exchange reaction are still useful to\nstudy the isovector M1 strengths.\n\nIII.\n\nEXPERIMENT\n\nThe experiment was performed at the Research Center for Nuclear Physics, Osaka University, using 450-MeV 3 He, 200-MeV polarized deuteron, and 392-MeV polarized proton\nbeams. The polarized proton and deuteron beams were obtained from the high-intensity\npolarized ion source [6]. These beams extracted from the ring cyclotron were achromatically transported to the targets. The beam intensity on target was in the range of 1-10\nenA. A self-supporting\n\n11\n\nB target with a thickness of 16.7 mg/cm2 and a natural carbon\n\ntarget with a thickness of 30.0 mg/cm2 were used in the (d, d\u2032 ) measurement. Scattered\n5\n\n\fparticles were momentum analyzed by the high-resolution spectrometer Grand Raiden [7].\nThe focal-plane detector system of Grand Raiden consisting of two multiwire drift chambers\nand plastic scintillation detectors allowed the reconstruction of the scattering angle at the\ntarget via ray-tracing techniques. In the forward angle measurements of the (p, p\u2032 ) and (d, d\u2032)\nreactions, a collimator block was placed in front of the focal plane detectors to avoid a high\ncounting rate due to the elastic scattering events. A focal plane polarimeter (FPP) was\nused to measure the polarization of protons scattered from the target in the (p, p\u2032 ) reaction.\nThe FPP consisted of a carbon slab with a thickness of 12 cm as a polarization analyzer,\nfour multiwire proportional chambers, and scintillator hodoscopes [8]. For the experimental\nsetup, see Refs. [9, 10] and references therein.\nTypical spectra of the 11 B(3 He, t),\n\n11\n\nB(p, p\u2032), and 11 B(d, d\u2032) reactions are shown in Fig. 2.\n\nIn Figs. 2(b) and (c), elastic scattering events disappear since elastically scattered particles\nwere stopped at the collimator block placed in front of the focal plane detectors. As seen\nin Fig. 2(b), the excitation energy spectrum for the\n\n11\n\nB(d, d\u2032 ) reaction is observed up to\n\nEx \u2243 17.5 MeV. An energy resolution of 300 keV full width at half maximum (FWHM) was\nobtained in the\n\n11\n\nB(3 He, t) measurement. Since the magnetic spectrometer was operated\n\nnear the maximum magnetic field in the 11 B(3 He, t) measurement, the aberration due to the\nmagnetic saturation contributed to deteriorate the energy resolution. In the\n11\n\n11\n\nB(d, d\u2032) and\n\nB(p, p\u2032 ) measurements, energy resolutions of 150 keV and 200 keV (FWHM) were obtained\n\nrespectively, which were dominated by the energy spreads of the cyclotron beams. All the\nprominent peaks were identified as those of known states in\nimpurities in the\n\n11\n\n11\n\nB or\n\n11\n\nC [11]. Contaminating\n\nB target were identified by the kinematic energy shift in the elastic\n\nscattering at backward angles, and those contributions were estimated to be less than 1%,\n0.8%, and 0.08% for\n\nIV.\n\n10\n\nB,\n\n12\n\nC, and\n\n16\n\nO, respectively.\n\nRESULT AND DISCUSSION\n\nSince the spin-isospin term V\u03c3\u03c4 in the effective interaction is dominant in the (3 He, t)\nreaction at 150 MeV/nucleon, transitions to the strong peaks in Fig. 2(a) are inferred to\nhave a spin-flip nature. On the other hand, the scalar term V0 is dominant in the (d, d\u2032)\nreaction at 100 MeV/nucleon. Thus, it is natural to infer that the strongly excited states\nin Fig. 2(b) have a non-spin-flip nature. This simple consideration leads to a qualitative\n6\n\n\f\u2212\n\u2212\nconclusion that the 7/2\u2212\n1 and 3/23 states have a non-spin-flip characteristic while the 5/22\n\nstate mainly has a spin-flip characteristic.\n\nA.\n\n11 B(3 He,\n\nt) reaction\n\nThe cross sections for the\n\n11\n\nB(3 He, t) reaction are shown in Fig. 3. To determine the GT\n\nstrength from the cross sections, the distorted-wave impulse-approximation (DWIA) calculation was performed using a computer code DWBA98 [12]. Optical-model parameters for\nthe entrance channel were obtained from the 3 He elastic scattering on\n\n13\n\nC at E(3 He) = 450\n\nMeV [13]. For the exit channel, the same radius and diffuseness with the entrance channel\nwere used while the potential depth was modified to be 85% of the depth for the entrance\nchannel [14]. Wave functions were obtained from the shell-model calculation using the POT\ninteraction by Cohen and Kurath [15]. Single-particle wave functions were calculated by\nusing a harmonic oscillator (HO) potential, and the oscillation length b for the HO potential was determined for each state to reproduce the measured cross sections as tabulated in\nTable I.\nAn effective 3 He-N interaction with isospin (V\u03c4 ), spin-isospin (V\u03c3\u03c4 ), and isospin-tensor\n(V\u03c4T ) terms, represented by a Yukawa potential, was employed to describe the projectiletarget interaction. Ranges for the Yukawa potentials were fixed at 1.42 fm and 0.88 fm for\nthe central and tensor terms, respectively. For the central potential, the strength ratio of\nR2 = |V\u03c3\u03c4 /V\u03c4 |2 = 8.24 \u00b1 0.11 is widely used at 450 MeV [10], but recent studies implies\nthat a smaller value of R2 might be preferable for light nuclei [16]. Actually, the R2 value is\nestimated to be 5.24 at 150 MeV/nucleon and A=11 from the Franey-Love interaction [17].\nWe, therefore, tested both R2 = 8.24 and R2 = 5.24 to study the effect on the final B(GT\u2212 )\nvalues by R2 .\nThe absolute strength of the central potential was determined by comparing the DWIA\ncalculation with the experimental data for the ground-state transition. The cross section was\ndescribed by an incoherent sum over the cross sections for the different multipole transitions,\nX\nd\u03c3\nd\u03c3\nA(\u2206J \u03c0 ) (\u2206J \u03c0 ),\n=\nd\u03a9 \u2206J \u03c0\nd\u03a9\n\n(9)\n\nwhere the normalization factors A(\u2206J \u03c0 )'s were determined to reproduce the experimental\ndata. Since each multipole cross section was calculated by using shell-model wave functions,\n7\n\n\fthe GT and Fermi transition strengths were related to the normalization factors by\nB(GT\u2212 )exp = A(\u2206J \u03c0 = 1+ )B(GT\u2212 )SM ,\n\n(10)\n\nB(F)exp = A(\u2206J \u03c0 = 0+ )B(F)SM ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere B(GT\u2212 )SM and B(F)SM are the GT and Fermi strengths predicted by the shell-model\ncalculation. The ground-state GT transition strength is known to be B(GT\u2212 ) = 0.345\u00b10.008\nfrom the \u03b2-decay strength, and the Fermi transition strength is given by B(F) = N \u2212 Z =\n1. Since the POT wave function predicted B(GT\u2212 ) = 0.623 and B(F) = 1.000 for the\nground-state transition, the normalization factors were fixed at A(\u2206J \u03c0 = 1+ ) = 0.554 and\nA(\u2206J \u03c0 = 0+ ) = 1.000 in the analysis. Finally, V\u03c4 = 1.5 MeV and V\u03c3\u03c4 = \u22124.2 MeV were\nobtained for R2 = 8.24 while V\u03c4 = 1.7 MeV and V\u03c3\u03c4 = \u22123.9 MeV were for R2 = 5.24. The\nvalue of V\u03c4T was determined to be \u22122.5 MeV/fm2 .\nThe calculated cross sections for the transitions to the ground and excited states in\n\n11\n\nC\n\nare compared with the experimental results in Fig. 3. Although only the results of the\ncalculations with R2 = 8.24 are shown in Fig. 3, those of the calculations with R2 = 5.24 are\nquite similar. As seen in Fig. 3, the DWIA calculations successfully explain the experimental\nresults.\nThe GT strengths obtained from the \u2206J \u03c0 = 1+ cross sections are compared with the\nprevious (p, n) result [18] in Table I. The present results are consistent with the (p, n)\nresult although several states are not resolved in the (p, n) measurement due to poor energy\nresolution. We found that the R2 = 8.24 results give the B(GT\u2212 ) values close to the (p, n)\nresult. The B(GT\u2212 ) values for R2 = 8.24 are smaller than those for R2 = 5.24 by 15%. This\ndifference of 15% in the B(GT\u2212 ) values almost equals to the difference in the |V\u03c3\u03c4 |2 values\nbetween the R2 = 8.24 and 5.24 cases. This fact indicates that the factorized expression\nfor the charge exchange reaction [19] gives a good description for the (3 He, t) reaction at\nE(3 He) = 450 MeV. The B(GT\u2212 ) value for the 8.10-MeV 3/2\u2212\n3 state is very small and\nthis result is consistent with the previous simple consideration that the 3/2\u2212\n3 state has a\nnon-spin-flip characteristic.\n\n8\n\n\fTABLE I: Oscillation length used in the DWIA calculation and B(GT) values.\nEx (MeV)\n\nJ\u03c0\n\nB(GT\u2212 )a\n\nb (fm)\nR2 = 8.24\n\na\nb\n\nB(GT\u2212 )b\nR2 = 5.24\n\n0.00\n\n3/2\u2212\n\n1.61\n\n2.00\n\n1/2\u2212\n\n1.61\n\n0.402 \u00b1 0.031\n\n0.461 \u00b1 0.036\n\n4.32\n\n5/2\u2212\n\n1.66\n\n0.454 \u00b1 0.026\n\n0.521 \u00b1 0.031\n\n4.80\n\n3/2\u2212\n\n1.73\n\n0.480 \u00b1 0.031\n\n0.551 \u00b1 0.036\n\n8.10\n\n3/2\u2212\n\n1.81\n\n\u2264 0.003\n\n\u2264 0.004\n\n8.42\n\n5/2\u2212\n\n1.88\n\n0.406 \u00b1 0.038\n\n0.466 \u00b1 0.045\n\n0.345 \u00b1 0.008\n\n0.345 \u00b1 0.008\n0.399 \u00b1 0.032\no\n\n0.961 \u00b1 0.060\n\no\n\n0.444 \u00b1 0.010\n\nPresent result.\nFrom Ref. [18]\n\nB.\n\n11 B(d, d\u2032 )\n\nand\n\n12 C(d, d\u2032 )\n\nreactions\n\nThe measured cross sections for the 11 B(d, d\u2032 ) and 12 C(d, d\u2032 ) reactions exciting the several\nlow-lying states are shown in Figs. 4 and 5. The (d, d\u2032 ) cross section was given by an\nincoherent sum over the cross sections for the different multipole transitions. To derive the\nisoscalar spin-flip M1 strength B(\u03c3) from the experiment, the (d, d\u2032 ) cross section for each\n\u2206J \u03c0 transition was needed.\nMicroscopic calculations for deuteron induced reactions are generally difficult because the\ndeuteron is a loosely bound two-body system and its internal degree of freedom has to be\ntaken into account. Recently, a microscopic calculation using a three-body d-N interaction\nwas performed and gave a good description for the\n\n12\n\nC(d, d\u2032) reaction at Ed = 270 MeV at\n\nbackward angles of \u03b8 \u2265 5\u25e6 [20]. This calculation, however, does not reproduce the angular\ndistribution of the cross section at forward angles near 0\u25e6 where \u2206J \u03c0 = 1+ transitions\nbecome strong. Therefore, the application of such microscopic calculations is not suitable\nfor our purpose to estimate the cross sections for each \u2206J \u03c0 transition and to determine the\nisoscalar spin-flip M1 strength. In the present work, we measured the\nthe comparison with the\n12\n\n11\n\n12\n\nC(d, d\u2032 ) reaction for\n\nB(d, d\u2032 ) reaction. Since the spin-parity of the ground state of\n\nC is 0+ , transitions to the discrete states in\n\n12\n\nC are expected to be good references for the\n\nangular distributions of the cross sections for certain \u2206J \u03c0 transitions.\n\n9\n\n\fTo parameterize the angular distributions of the cross sections for the 4.44-MeV 2+\n1\nand 7.65-MeV 0+\n2 states in\n\n12\n\nC, we asked for a help of a deformed potential (DP) model\n\ncalculation using a computer code ECIS95 [21]. Optical-model potentials for the DP-model\nanalysis were parameterized as\n\u0012\n\n~\nU(r) = \u2212V f (r, rR , aR ) \u2212 iW f (r, rI , aI ) + 2\nm\u03c0 c\nwhere\n\n\u00132\n\nVSO\n\n1 d\nf (r, rSO , aSO )l * s + VC , (12)\nr dr\n\n\u0013\u0015\u22121\n\u0014\n\u0012\nr \u2212 rx A1/3\n.\nf (r, rx , ax ) = 1 + exp\nax\n\n(13)\n\nThe Coulomb potential VC was taken as that of a uniformly charged sphere with a radius\nof RC = 1.3A1/3 fm. Three parameter sets 'B', 'C', and 'BC' tabulated in Table II were\ndetermined by fitting the cross sections, vector analyzing powers (Ay ), and tensor analyzing\npowers (Ayy ) for the elastic scattering from the\n\n11\n\nB and\n\n12\n\nC targets. The parameter sets\n\n'B' and 'C' were obtained from the independent analysis of the\n\n11\n\nB and\n\n12\n\nC data. The\n\nparameter set 'BC' was determined by fitting both the 11 B and 12 C data simultaneously. As\nseen from the \u03c72 values in Table II, almost the same quality of the fit is obtained for the\nthree parameter sets. The results from the optical-model calculation with the parameter set\n'BC' are presented by the solid lines in Fig. 6.\nUsing the obtained optical-model potential, we calculated the transition potential according to the prescription of the DP model [22]. The result of the DP-model calculation with\nthe parameter set 'BC' is shown by the dashed lines in Figs. 5(a) and (b). Unfortunately\nthe DP-model calculation with the parameter set 'BC' is not satisfactory for reproducing\n+\nthe cross sections for the 2+\n1 and 02 states. To obtain the better descriptions, we modified\n\nthe optical-model potentials by fitting the elastic and inelastic scattering data simultaneously. During the process of the modification, the potential parameters for the \u2206J \u03c0 = 0+\nand 2+ transitions were searched for independently, and we additionally introduced the real\nand imaginary surface terms into the optical-model potential. This procedure means that\nwe allocate additional degrees of freedom for the precise parameterization of the potential\nshape in the surface region where the incident deuterons are strongly absorbed. As the\nresult of the modification, the \u2206J \u03c0 = 2+ and 0+ cross sections were well-fitted as shown by\nthe solid lines in Figs. 5(a) and (b) although the optical-model calculations for the elastic\nscattering became slightly worse as seen in Fig. 6. We estimated that the change of the\n\n10\n\n\fTABLE II: Optical model parameters derived from our best fit to the elastic scattering data.\nParameter sets 'B' and 'C' were determined by fitting the elastic scattering on 11 B and 12 C respectively, while 'BC' was by fitting both the\n\n11 B\n\nand\n\n12 C\n\ndata simultaneously.\n\u03c72\n\nV\n\nrR\n\naR\n\nW\n\nrI\n\naI\n\nVSO\n\nrSO\n\naSO\n\n(MeV)\n\n(fm)\n\n(fm)\n\n(MeV)\n\n(fm)\n\n(fm)\n\n(MeV)\n\n(fm)\n\n(fm)\n\nB\n\n20.36\n\n1.50\n\n0.65\n\n35.25\n\n0.66\n\n1.06\n\n1.68\n\n1.00\n\n0.68\n\n1160\n\nC\n\n20.45\n\n1.51\n\n0.65\n\n31.45\n\n0.78\n\n1.02\n\n1.79\n\n0.98\n\n0.70\n\n1396\n\nBC\n\n20.24\n\n1.51\n\n0.65\n\n33.27\n\n0.72\n\n1.05\n\n1.74\n\n0.99\n\n0.69\n\n2599\n\ncross-section values due to the coupled channel effect is smaller than 10%. This effect is,\ntherefore, neglected in the present analysis.\nAlthough a question is addressed on the physical interpretation of the potential modification described above, it should be emphasized that our purpose is simply to parameterize\nthe angular distributions of the cross section for the \u2206J \u03c0 = 0+ and 2+ transitions in the\n12\n\nC(d, d\u2032 ) reaction and to perform the multipole decomposition analysis for the\n\n11\n\nB(d, d\u2032)\n\nreaction. The basic assumption of the present analysis is that the collective transition form\nfactors reflected to the cross-section shape for a certain \u2206J \u03c0 transition in the 12 C(d, d\u2032 ) and\n11\n\nB(d, d\u2032 ) reactions are similar. The validity of this assumption could be tested by checking\n\nwhether the angular distribution in the\n\n11\n\nB(d, d\u2032 ) reaction is reasonably explained or not.\n\nOn the other hand, the angular distribution of the cross section for the 12.71-MeV 1+\n1\nstate was parameterized as a function of the momentum transfer q using spherical Bessel\nfunctions\nd\u03c3 +\n(1 ) = \u03b10 |j0 (qR0 )|2 + \u03b12 |j2 (qR2 )|2 .\nd\u03a9 1\n\n(14)\n\nFour parameters in the above equation were determined to be R0 = 1.26A1/3 fm, R1 =\n1.52A1/3 fm, \u03b10 = 1.13 mb/sr, and \u03b11 = 1.27 mb/sr by fitting the experimental data as\nshown by the solid line in Fig. 5(c).\nThe cross sections for the \u2206J \u03c0 = 0+ , 1+ and 2+ transitions in the\n\n11\n\nB(d, d\u2032 ) reaction\n\nwere calculated using the modified potentials for the DP-model calculation and the spherical\nBessel functions which were determined in the\n11\n\n12\n\nC(d, d\u2032 ) analysis. Then, the measured\n\nB(d, d\u2032 ) cross sections were fitted by combining the calculated cross sections. In the fitting\n\nprocedure, the higher multipole contributions with \u2206J \u2265 3 were neglected. As seen in\n11\n\n\fTABLE III: Isoscalar spin-flip M1 transition strength B(\u03c3).

This means that the basic\nassumption on the similarity between the\n\n12\n\nC(d, d\u2032 ) and\n\n11\n\nB(d, d\u2032 ) reactions is reasonable.\n\n\u03c0\n+\n+\nAlthough the 4.44-MeV 5/2\u2212\n1 state can be excited by both the \u2206J = 1 and 2 tran-\n\nsitions, the main part of the transition is due to \u2206J \u03c0 = 2+ . This result is explained if the\nground and 4.44-MeV states are the strongly coupled members of the ground-state rotational\nband. Since the observed \u2206J \u03c0 = 2+ transition strength is much stronger than the expected\n\u2206J \u03c0 = 1+ strength, the \u2206J \u03c0 = 1+ component of the transition strength can not be reliably\nextracted for the 4.44-MeV state. The transition strength for the 6.74-MeV 7/2\u2212\n1 state is\nalso dominated by the \u2206J \u03c0 = 2+ component although the \u2206J \u03c0 = 1 transition to this state\nis not allowed.\nThe cross section for the \u2206J \u03c0 = 1+ transition is known to be proportional to the isoscalar\nspin-flip M1 strength B(\u03c3). The B(\u03c3) value for the transition to the 2.12-MeV 1/2\u2212\n1 state is\n0.037\u00b10.008, which is obtained from the \u03b3-decay widths of the mirror states and the B(GT\u2212 )\nvalue [2]. Using this value, the cross sections for the \u2206J \u03c0 = 1+ transitions for other excited\nstates were converted to the B(\u03c3) values as tabulated in Table III. Systematic uncertainties\non B(\u03c3) are mainly due to errors in the model calculation for the (d, d\u2032 ) reaction. The\nnormalization uncertainty of 20% is not shown in Table III, which is attributed to the\nuncertainty on the B(\u03c3) value for the 2.12-MeV state taken from Ref. [2].\nThe 8.56-MeV 3/2\u2212\n3 state, which is not predicted by the shell-model calculation with the\nPOT potential, has a strong \u2206J \u03c0 = 0+ component. Although the isobaric analog state of\n12\n\n\fthe 8.56-MeV state is observed at Ex = 8.10 MeV in the 11 B(3 He, t) reaction, the excitation\nstrength is extremely weak. These facts indicate that the 3/2\u2212\n3 state in the A = 11 system\nis collective, and the single-particle aspect of its wave function is small.\nIt is noteworthy that the A = 11 and 12 systems have several similarities in the collective\nnature, i.e. the first member of the ground-state rotational band appears at Ex = 4.44 MeV\nand the collective E0 state appears around Ex = 8 MeV. Although the deeper discussion\nabout the collective nature of 11 B is out of the scope of the present work, a comparative study\nof the collective nature in the A = 11 and 12 systems might provide precious information to\nimprove the nuclear cluster model which is one of recent interesting topics [23].\n\nC.\n\n11 B(p,\n\np\u2032 ) reaction\n\nThe cross sections, analyzing powers (Ay ), induced polarizations (P ), and depolarization\nparameters (DN N ) for the 11 B(p, p\u2032 ) reaction are shown in Fig. 7. The DWIA calculation was\nperformed by using the computer code DWBA98. The effective nucleon-nucleon interaction\nderived by Franey and Love at 425 MeV [17] was used in the calculations. The global\nDirac optical-model potential was used in the Shr\u00f6dinger equivalent form [24] to give the\ndistorted waves of incoming and outgoing protons. The (p, p\u2032 ) cross sections were given by\nan incoherent sum over the cross section of the different multipole contribution as in the\ncases of the analyses for the (3 He, t) and (d, d\u2032 ) reactions. The cross section for each \u2206J \u03c0\ntransition was described by a coherent sum of the isovector and isoscalar contributions.\nSince the isovector and isoscalar transition strengths for the several states in\n\n11\n\nB have\n\nbeen already obtained from the (3 He, t) and (d, d\u2032 ) analyses in the present work, the DWIA\ncalculation for the\n\n11\n\nB(p, p\u2032 ) reaction can be performed without any free parameters. The\n\nisovector strengths determined by using R2 = 8.24 were used in the calculation. Since the\nisoscalar spin-flip M1 strength was not reliably determined in the (d, d\u2032 ) analysis for the\n4.44-MeV state, the isoscalar spin-flip M1 strength was assumed to be\nB(\u03c3)exp = B(\u03c3\u03c4z )exp\n\nB(\u03c3)SM\n,\nB(\u03c3\u03c4z )SM\n\n(15)\n\ni. e. the relative strength of the isoscalar transition to the isovector transition was taken\nfrom the the shell-model calculation.\nAs shown in Fig. 7, the DWIA calculation well explains the experimental results except\n13\n\n\fthe cross section for the transition to the 8.92-MeV state. This supports the reliability of\nthe 11 B(3 He, t) and\n\n11\n\nB(d, d\u2032 ) analyses. The calculated cross section for the 8.92-MeV state\n\nis about 50% smaller than the experiment. One remarkable fact predicted by the DWIA\ncalculation using the POT wave functions is that the isovector and isoscalar components\ndestructively contribute for the \u2206J \u03c0 = 1+ transition to the 8.92-MeV state, while these two\ncomponents constructively contribute for the 2.12-MeV, 4.44-MeV, and 5.02-MeV states.\nHowever, the considerable decrease of 50% in the (p, p\u2032 ) cross section can not be explained\neven if a constructive interference is assumed. The reason why the DWIA calculation underestimates the cross section for the transition to the 8.92-MeV state is still unclear. The\nresult may imply that the 8.92-MeV state has a wave function totally different from the\nother states at 2.12, 4.44, and 5.02 MeV.\nSince the |V\u03c3\u03c4 /V\u03c3 |2 value of the effective nucleon-nucleon interaction is large, the cross\nsection for the \u2206J \u03c0 = 1+ transition is dominated by the isovector component and is insensitive to the relative strength between the isovector and isoscalar components. However,\nthe polarization transfer observables are sensitive to the relative strength in the spin-flip\ntransition. Since the depolarization parameter was measured in the present experiment, the\nrelative strength between the isovector and isoscalar components in the \u2206J \u03c0 = 1+ transition is, in principle, determined from the (p, p\u2032 ) result. Although we tried to determine\nthe relative strength by fitting the measured depolarization parameter, such analyses were\nfound to be unacceptable; the isoscalar strengths for all the states are strongly suppressed.\nThis unrealistic result is mainly caused by errors in the effective nucleon-nucleon interaction. Therefore, the precise determination of the effective interaction is strongly desired.\nAdditional measurements of other kinds of the polarization transfer observables (e.g. DSS\nand DLL ) would be helpful in clarifying the unclear situation discussed above.\n\nD.\n\nComparisons with the previous experiment and the shell-model calculation\n\nAlthough the two doublets at 4.32-4.80 MeV and 8.11-8.42 MeV in 11 C are not separately\nresolved in the previous (p, n) measurement [18], the B(GT\u2212 ) values for the charge exchange\nreactions to the low-lying states in\nthe low-lying states in\n\n11\n\n11\n\nC have been obtained. Recently, the B(\u03c3\u03c4z ) values for\n\nB are reported by KVI group from the (p, p\u2032 ) measurement at\n\nEp = 150 MeV [25]. These results are compared with the present results in Fig. 8. The\n14\n\n\fresult with R2 = 8.24 is preferable from a view of the consistency with the (p, n) results.\nThe results from Ref. [25] are systematically smaller than those from the other experiments.\nThis inconsistency seems to be originated from the difficult normalization process in the\nDWIA calculation. The calculated cross sections depend on various parameters, i.e. the\nnuclear transition strength, the distorting potential, the effective interaction, and so on. The\nuncertainties of the distorting potential and the effective interaction cause large systematic\nuncertainties in the normalization.\nThe present results are compared with the shell-model predictions using the POT [15]\nand SFO (Suzuki-Fujimoto-Otsuka) [26] interactions in Fig. 9. The shell-model calculations\nwith the POT and SFO interactions are performed in the 0~\u03c9 and 0 \u2212 2~\u03c9 configuration\nspaces, respectively. The hatched and open bars in the left panels show the B(GT\u2212 ) results\ndeduced from the analyses using R2 = 8.24 and R2 = 5.24, respectively. The open bar in\nthe upper-right panel shows the B(\u03c3) value for the 4.44-MeV state, which is estimated from\nthe B(GT\u2212 ) value by using Eqs. (8) and (15). Both the calculations with the POT and SFO\nwave functions well explain the excitation energies, but the predicted excitation strengths are\nunacceptably large. The calculations with the SFO wave functions are better in describing\nthe excitation strength since the 2p-2h configuration mixing is taken into account, but the\nexcitation strengths are still overestimated by 20-50%.\n\nE.\n\nTransition strengths for neutrino induced reactions\n\nThe cross section for the CC transition\n\n11\n\nB(\u03bde , e\u2212 ) is given as follows at the long wave-\n\nlength limit [2],\n\u03c3CC =\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\n(GF cos \u03b8c )2\n|M(\u03c4\u2212 )|2 + gA2 |M(\u03c3\u03c4\u2212 )|2 Ee\u2032 |p\u2032e | F (Z, Ee\u2032 ),\n4\u03c0\n2Ji + 1\n\n(16)\n\nwhere GF is the Fermi coupling constant, \u03b8c is the Cabibbo angle, gA is the axial isovector\ncoupling constant, Ji is the initial nuclear spin, Ee\u2032 (p\u2032e ) is the energy (momentum) of the\noutgoing electron, F (Z, Ee\u2032 ) is the Coulomb function for the final electron, and Z is the\ncharge of the residual nucleus.

The isovector\nand isoscalar components destructively contribute to \u03bbN C for the 5/2\u2212\n2 state although they\nconstructively contribute for the other states. The relative phases between the isovector and\nisoscalar components were taken from the shell-model predictions, which are in agreement\nwith the results of the\n\n11\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\nB(p, p\u2032 ) analyses for the 1/2\u2212\n1 , 5/21 , and 3/22 states in\n\n11\n\nB.\n\nThe value of fA /gA is known to be 0.1-0.15 from the experiments [3, 4], meaning that the\ncontribution from the axial isoscalar coupling to the NC process increases the expected NC\nstrength by 40%. It is noted that the isoscalar contributions were neglected in Refs. [25, 27].\nIn Ref. [2], the \u03bbN C value for the 1/2\u2212\n1 state was determined from the experimental data\nwithout using any particular nuclear model, but those for the other states were estimated\nby combining the results from the experiments and from the shell-model calculation. The\nestimated \u03bbN C values given in Ref. [2] are consistent with the present experimental result.\n\n16\n\n\fV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe measured cross sections for the\n\n11\n\nB(3 He, t),\n\n11\n\nB(d, d\u2032 ), and\n\n11\n\nB(p, p\u2032 ) reactions at\n\nforward scattering angles including 0\u25e6 to study the isovector and isoscalar spin-flip M1 transition strengths. Analyzing powers, induced polarizations, and depolarization parameters\nwere measured for the\n\n11\n\nB(p, p\u2032 ) reaction.\n\nThe measured 11 B(3 He, t) cross sections were compared with the DWIA calculation using\nthe POT wave functions. The effective 3 He-N interaction was obtained by fitting the cross\nsections for the ground-state transition. The cross sections for the transitions to the excited\nstates in\n\n11\n\nC were decomposed into each \u2206J \u03c0 component based on the DWIA calculation,\n\nand the B(GT\u2212 ) values were extracted from the \u2206J \u03c0 = 1+ contribution. The B(GT\u2212 )\nvalues are easily converted to the isovector spin-flip M1 strengths B(\u03c3\u03c4z ) for the analogue\ntransitions under the assumption of the isospin symmetry.\nIn the analysis of the\n\n11\n\nB(d, d\u2032 ) reaction, we used the\n\n12\n\nC(d, d\u2032 ) reaction as a measure\n\nto obtain the angular distribution of the cross section for each \u2206J \u03c0 contribution. After the\nangular distribution was obtained, the\n\n11\n\nB(d, d\u2032 ) cross section for each excited state was\n\ndecomposed into the \u2206J \u03c0 = 0+ , 1+ , and 2+ components. Finally, the obtained cross section\nfor the \u2206J \u03c0 = 1+ component was converted to the isoscalar spin-flip M1 strength B(\u03c3).\nThe isovector and isoscalar transition strengths obtained in the 11 B(3 He, t) and 11 B(d, d\u2032)\nanalyses were used for performing the DWIA calculation to analyze the\ndata. The DWIA calculation reasonably explains the present\n\n11\n\n11\n\nB(p, p\u2032 ) reaction\n\nB(p, p\u2032 ) result except the\n\ncross section for the transition to the 8.92-MeV states and supports the reliability of the\npresent\n\n11\n\nB(3 He, t) and\n\n11\n\nB(d, d\u2032 ) analyses. The DWIA calculation considerably underesti-\n\nmates the cross section for the transition to the 8.92-MeV state. This result implies that\nthe 8.92-MeV state has a nature totally different from the other three states at the lower\nexcited energies.\nThe obtained spin-flip M1 strengths were compared with the shell-model calculations\nusing the POT and SFO interactions. Although the excitation energies for the excited states\nare reasonably in agreement with the shell-model calculations, the transition strengths are\noverestimated by 20-50%. The transition strengths for the neutrino induced reactions were\nestimated by using the isovector and isoscalar spin-flip M1 strengths. The present results\nare quantitatively in agreement with the theoretical estimation discussing the axial-isoscalar\n17\n\n\fcoupling in the neutrino scattering process, and are useful in the future measurement of the\nstellar neutrinos using the neutral- and charged-current reactions on\n\n11\n\nB.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors would like to thank Prof. H.
