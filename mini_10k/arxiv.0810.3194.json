Introduction\nIn relativistic heavy-ion collisions a large amount of energy is deposited in the\ninteraction region over a very short time interval \u03c4 \u223c 2RA /\u03b3. An excited state of\nmatter, the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), is expected to be formed and its properties\nare subject to intense theoretical and experimental investigation. From SPS to RHIC\n\u221a\nand to the LHC, with increasing s, hard probes 1,2 have become increasingly\nmore important as tomographic tools in the study of the QGP. Their perturbative\nQCD (pQCD) calculation is based on the factorization theorem, which separates the\nhard partonic part from the soft, non-perturbative part. For a physics observable\ndF/dyd2 pT in p+p collisions we have:\ndF\n\u221d \u03c6a/A (\u03beA , \u03bcf )\u03c6b/B (\u03beB , \u03bcf )\ndyd2 pT\n\u2297\n\ndF\u0302 a+b\u2192c+X\n\u2297 Dh/c (z, \u03bcf ) .\ndyd2 pT\n1\n\n(1)\n\n\fDecember 9, 2018 12:6 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\n2\n\nphoton-mpla-v2\n\nBen-Wei Zhang and Ivan Vitev\n\nHere, dF\u0302 a+b\u2192c+X /dyd2 pT represents the partonic cross section, while \u03c6a/A (\u03beA , \u03bcf )\nand Dh/c (z, \u03bcf ) are the non -perturbative parton distribution functions (PDF) and\nparton fragmentation functions (FF), respectively. In nucleus-nucleus (A+A) collisions, the result of final-state interactions can often be represented as effective a\nmodifications of the FFs. Similarly, cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects resulting\nfrom the initial-state interations in cold nuclei can be absorbed in effective modifications of the PDFs. The latter will also be present in A+A collisions and a\nrobust calculation of QGP signatures needs reliable understanding of initial-state\ninteractions.\nSince the photon couples to the partons in the collision region only through electromagnetic interactions (\u03b1em \u226a \u03b1s ) its mean free path is very large. Hard photons\nleave the medium without rescattering and their production can provide valuable\ninformation to help constrain initial-state CNM effects. The study of \u03b3 production\nin A+A has so far been centered on its QGP-specific components, in particular\nmedium-induced photon emission in the QGP and jet-photon conversion 3 . The\npredicted consequential large enhancement of the direct photon production cross\nsection in central heavy-ion collisions appears to be incompatible with recent data 4 .\nOur paper 5 addresses the need for a systematic study of direct photon production\nin both p+A and A+A reactions by taking consistently into account all relevant\nhot and cold nuclear matter effects. We concentrate on the intermediate and large\ntransverse momentum regions (pT > 2 GeV) in minimum bias d+Cu and d+Au\nand central Cu+Cu and Au+Au heavy ion collisions at RHIC with center of mass\n\u221a\nenergies of s = 62.4 GeV and 200 GeV. We also provide the theoretical derivation\nof the medium-induced radiative \u03b3 spectrum for a quark emerging out of a large Q2\nprocess.\n2. Direct photon production in p+p collisions\nIn \"elementary\" p+p collisions direct photons can be produced, at leading-order in\nperturbation theory, by quark-antiquark annihilation (q + q\u0304 \u2192 \u03b3g) and Compton\nscattering (q+g \u2192 \u03b3q), see LHS of Fig. 1. One should also include the contribution of\nthe bremsstrahlung/fragmentation process illustrated in the RHS of Fig. 1. Naively,\nit seems that \u03b3 radiation gives a higher-order contribution (\u03b1em \u03b12s ) when compared\nto annihilation and Compton scattering (\u03b1em \u03b1s ). However, noticing the logarithmic\ngrowth with the hard scale Q2 of the photon fragmentation function D\u03b3/c (z, Q2 ),\nparametrically we have:\nQ2\nQ2\n), D\u03b3/c (z, Q2 ) \u221d ln( 2 )\n2\n\u039b\n\u039b\n\u03b1em \u03b12s (Q2 )D\u03b3/c (z, Q2 ) \u221d \u03b1em \u03b1s (Q2 ).\n\u03b1s (Q) \u221d ln\u22121 (\n\na The\n\n(2)\n\nconvenience of a particular mathematical representation of nuclear matter effects on the\nobservable cross section should not be confused with genuine universal modification (which may\nalso be present) of the parton distribution and fragmentation functions.\n\n\fDecember 9, 2018 12:6 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\nphoton-mpla-v2\n\nDirect photon production in d+A and A+A collisions at RHIC\n\n3\n\n\u03b3\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 1.

(1), where we also allow for possible deviations from\ncollinearity for the incoming partons:\nZ\n\u221d d2 ka d2 kb f (ka )f (kb )(* * * ) .\n(3)\nFurther technical details are given in 5 and we emphasize that any overall scale\nfactor (e.g. the process-dependent NLO K-factor) will cancel when we calculate the\nnuclear modification ratio RAB (pT ).\nIn Fig. 2 we show our numerical results for the differential cross sections for direct\n\u221a\n\u221a\nphotons in p+p collisions at s = 62.4 GeV and s = 200 GeV. The power-law\npT dependence of the data at 200 GeV, measured by PHENIX 7 , is well described\nby the pQCD calculation.

Direct photon production in heavy-ion collisions: hot nuclear\nmatter effects\nWe first discuss final-state QGP-induced modifications to d\u03c3 \u03b3 /dyd2 pT .\n\u2022 Jet quenching in the QGP\nIt is well established that when an energetic parton propagates in a\nhot/dense nuclear medium, it will suffer multiple scattering and lose a fraction of its energy via induced gluon radiation 1 . This jet quenching effect\nwill reduce the contribution of the fragmentation photons due to the attenuation of the flux of energetic quarks. We calculate the parton energy\nloss using the GLV formalism and represent the effective fragmentation\nfunctions into photons as follows:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ 1\u2212z\n1\nz\nD\u03b3/c (z) \u21d2\nd\u01eb P (\u01eb)\n.\n(4)\nD\u03b3/c\n1\u2212\u01eb\n1\u2212\u01eb\n0\nHere, P (\u01eb) is the probability distribution of the fractional jet energy loss\n\u01eb = \u2206E/E 8 .\n\u2022 Medium-induced photon radiation\nIn the hot QGP, a propagating jet may also radiate photons due to multiple scattering in the medium 5,3 Because there is no gauge-boson selfinteractions in \u03b3 bremsstrahlung, one may expect that the dI \u03b3 /d\u03c9 evaluation is a trivial simplification of the gluon intensity calculation. This naive\nexpectation is not true. Consider the radiative amplitude for single scattering of a fast on-shell quark (there are 3 diagrams in QCD, while 2 diagrams\nin QED as shown in Fig. 3):\n\u0013\n\u0012\n(k \u2212 q)\u22a5 i k2\u22a5+ z+ c a\nk\u22a5\ne 2k\n\u2212\nM\u03b3rad (k) \u221d 2igs \u01eb\u22a5 *\n[T , T ] .\n(5)\nk2\u22a5\n(k \u2212 q)2\u22a5\nIn the QED limit T c \u2192 1 and we obtain M\u03b3rad (k) \u2192 0. Thus, a theoretical approach optimized for medium-induced gluon radiation cannot be\ndirectly applied to photon bremsstrahlung in the medium and one should\nbe careful in identifying the correct kinematic approximations in evaluating\n\u03b3 emission 5,9 .\n\np\nf\n\np\ni\n\np\n\np\nf\n\ni\n\nqi\nzi\n\nFig. 3.\n\nq\n\nV(qi )\n\nzi\n\ni\nV(qi )\n\nSingle-Born diagrams for medium-induced \u03b3 emission.\n\n\fDecember 9, 2018 12:6 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\nphoton-mpla-v2\n\nDirect photon production in d+A and A+A collisions at RHIC\n\n5\n\nMeaningful direct photon phenomenology requires theoretical advances in\nunderstanding the medium-induced \u03b3 radiation off of quarks produced inside the plasma in large Q2 processes.

It is apparent that interference effect strongly suppresses stimulated photon emission when compared to the incoherent scenario. This reduction in emission strength, which\nis relevant for photon production in heavy ion reactions, differs significantly\nfrom the argued small LPM effect for on-shell quarks, see e.g. 3,10 . In our\ndetailed numerical simulations 5,8 we also find that the average number of\njet interactions in the medium is never large, hni = L/\u03bbq = 2 \u2212 3.\n\u2022 Jet-photon conversion\nIn the hot/dense medium, a possible new source of direct \u03b3 is jet-photon\nconversion 6,3 , see e.g. Fig. 5. Making the approximation that p\u03b3 \u2248 pc\nin the forward scattering process, we can derive the additional differential\nphoton multiplicity as follows:\nZ L\nqg\u2192\u03b3q\n\u03b3\ndt \u03c1(T )\u03c3tot\n(T ) ,\n(8)\nNconv.\n(c) =\nt0\n\nwhere the cross section is given by\nE\n\u03c0\u03b1s \u03b1em\n,\nln\n\u03c3 qg\u2192\u03b3q =\n6mD E\n2mD\n\n(9)\n\nwith s \u2248 2mD E and t \u2208 (m2D , s/4).

Direct photon production in heavy-ion collisions: cold nuclear\nmatter effects\nEven though in p+A collisions there are no final-state hot nuclear medium effects,\nthese still can not be regarded as a simple superposition of p+p scatterings. There\nare different types of CNM interactions that will manifest themselves in the cross\nsection for direct photon production in p+A and A+A reactions.\n\u2022 Isospin effect\nThe cross sections for direct photon production for p+p, p+n and n+n\ncollisions are different because they depend on the electric charges of the\nP\nquarks (\u03c3 \u221d q e2q ). The different quark composition of p and n will have\na significant impact on the nuclear modification factor of direct photon\n\u03b3\nproduction RAB\n(pT ) if the large xB region in the PDFs is probed.\n\u2022 Initial-state energy loss in cold nuclei\nA fast parton passing through cold nuclear matter may also lose energy\nbefore the hard scattering. There is plentiful evidence that this initial-state\nenergy loss is important for heavy ion phenomenology but only recently has\nit been calculated 11 . Its effect can be modeled as:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nxa,b\n2\n2\n,\n(11)\n,Q\n\u03c6a,b/N (xa,b , Q ) \u2192 \u03c6a,b/N\n1 \u2212 \u01eba,b\n\nwhere \u01eba,b are the fractional energy losses for the incoming partons a, b evaluated in the rest frame of the corresponding target nucleus with, typically,\n\u01eba,b \u226a 1.\n\u2022 Cronin effect\nInitial-state multiple scattering in cold nuclear matter will broaden the\ntransverse momenta of incoming partons before the hard scattering. The\nCronin effect, in our calculation, is modelled via such kT diffusion, hkT2 i =\nhkT2 ipp + hkT2 imed 1 ,\n\u0012 2 \u0013\n2\u03bc L\n\u03b6,\n(12)\nhkT2 imed =\n\u03bb\nq,g\nwhere \u03bc2 = 0.12 GeV2 , \u03bbg = (CF /CA )\u03bbq = 1 fm, L denotes the length of\nthe nuclear medium and \u03b6 accounts for the logarithmic dependence arising\nfrom large-angle scattering. Eq. (3) allows one to incorporate easily such\ntransverse momentum broadening into the pQCD calculation.\n\u2022 Shadowing and EMC effect\nIn our model shadowing was calculated from the coherent final-state parton interactions within the pQCD higher-twist collinear factorization approach 5 . The scale of power correction \u03be 2 is the only parameter constrained by the mean squared momentum transfer per unit length \u03bc2 /\u03bb,\n(\u03be 2 A1/3 )q,g \u2248 (2\u03bc2 L/\u03bb)q,g in minimum bias collisions, and by the world's\ndata on DIS on nuclei.

(1) and (3), augmented by including all QGP effects, calculated in Sect. 3, and CNM effects, discussed in Sect. 4, we can evaluate numerically the nuclear modification factor\n\u001e\nd\u03c3AB\nd\u03c3pp\n\u03b3\ncoll\nRAB (pT , b) =\nNAB\n(b)\n,\ndyd2 pT\ndyd2 pT\nand compare to available experimental data at RHIC. Since we focus on hard photon\nproduction with pT > 2 \u2212 3 GeV, the contribution from thermal photons is very\nsmall and thus neglected in the current study.\nFigure 6 shows numerical results of direct photon production for minimum-bias\n\u221a\nd+Au and d+Cu collisions at different colliding energies s = 62.4, 200 GeV by\ntaking into account all relevant CNM effects, which has not yet been done before in the literature according to our knowledge. Here to demonstrate the relative\n\u03b3\nimportance of different CNM effects, we calculated RdA\n(pT ) under different theoret\u03b3\n\u03b3\nical assumptions, namely, RdA (pT ) with isospin and Cronin effects, RdA\n(pT ) with\n\u03b3\nisospin, Cronin effect and shadowing effects, and RdA\n(pT ) with the initial-state\nenergy loss as well as isospin, Cronin and shadowing effects. And in all numerical\nsimulations the EMC effect is already included. We note that when pT < 6 GeV, the\nCronin effect is dominant and leads to cross section enhancement. For pT > 6 GeV,\n\u03b3\nthe isospin effect becomes important and RdA\n(pT ) < 1. The effect of initial-state\nenergy loss on direct \u03b3 attenuation is substantial but the EMC effect is small and\n\n\fDecember 9, 2018 12:6 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\nphoton-mpla-v2\n\nDirect photon production in d+A and A+A collisions at RHIC\n\n9\n\nnoticeable only at the low colliding energy and at the largest transverse momenta.\nIt is interesting to note that CNM effects have reduced direct photon production\n\u221a\nat pT \u223c 15 GeV by about 25% for d+A collisions at s = 200 GeV, and by about\n\u221a\n40% for reactions at s = 62.4 GeV. Due to large error bars in the data, current\nexperimental measurements in d+A cannot constrain more quantitatively parton\ndynamics in large nuclei and progress in this area is urgently needed.\nNext, we show results of direct photon production in central Au+Au and Cu+Cu\n\u221a\ncollisions at s = 62.4 GeV and 200 GeV in Fig. 7. Similar to calculations for\n\u03b3\nRdA\n(pT ), in Fig. 7 we demonstrate the relative strength of different nuclear matter\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\neffects by giving three curves of RAA\n(pT ): one stands for RAA\n(pT ) with coherent\nmedium-induced photon bremsstrahlung and jet-photon conversion as well as initial\u03b3\nstate energy loss; another curve represents RAA\n(pT ) with jet-photon conversion and\n\u03b3\ninitial-state energy loss; and the third curve denotes RAA\n(pT ) with only incoherent\nphoton radiation and jet-photon conversion in the QGP. By comparing Fig. 7 to\n\u03b3\nFig. 6 one can see that in A+A collisions RAA\n(pT ) for direct photon production\nis dominated by cold nuclear matter effects, amplified by the presence of two large\nnuclei. We note that in our treatment of photon bremsstrahlung in the QGP we have\nconsidered the coherent interference of medium-induced photon radiation with the\nhard emission from the large Q2 scattering of the parent quark, which effect, as\nwell as the initial-state energy loss effect, has been ignored in a previous study 10 .\nExperimental data clearly exclude both large Cronin enhancement and incoherent\nphoton emission, thereby providing support for the new theoretical developments\nreported in 5,11 . Copious jet-photon conversion 6 is also ruled out. In fact, in\ncontrast to early speculations we find that pT < 5 GeV medium-induced photons\ncontribute \u223c 10% to the observed cross section and inverse Compton scattering of\nenergetic quarks in the QGP is a < 25% correction. In the high pT region, the two\n\u03b3\nenhancement contributions are very small and RAA\n(pT ) < 1.\n6. Conclusions\nBy taking into account all relevant cold nuclear matter effects and the hot QGP\neffects we carried out the first systematic study of direct photon production in\np+A and A+A collisions at RHIC 5 . After consistent modeling of initial- and finalstate parton propagation in the medium we did not find theoretical justification for\nthe previously argued large QGP-induced enhancement of the direct photon cross\nsection. In fact, our results suggest that in both proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus\nreactions cold nuclear matter effects are dominant.
