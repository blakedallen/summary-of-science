The\navailable paths provide a natural division into systems characterized by long\norbital periods (>\n\u223c 60 days) and short orbital periods (<\n\u223c 30 days). Systems\nwith initial periods \u223c 1 \u2212 2 days, mainly driven by the loss of orbital angular\nmomentum, ultimately produce low mass helium white dwarfs (<\n\u223c 0.2M\u2299 ) with\nshort orbital periods (<\n\u223c 1 day). For longer initial periods (>\n\u223c few days), early\nmassive Case B evolution produces CO white dwarfs (>\n\u223c 0.35M\u2299 ) with orbital\nperiods of <\n\u223c 20 days. Common envelope evolutionary channels result in the\nformation of short period systems (<\n\u223c 1 day) from unstable low mass Case B\nevolution producing helium white dwarfs in the range \u223c 0.2 \u2212 0.5M\u2299 , and\nfrom unstable Case C evolution leading to CO white dwarfs more massive than\n\u223c 0.6M\u2299 .

The lack of observed systems between 23 and 56 days probably\nreflects the fact that for comparable initial orbital periods (>\n\u223c few days) low\nmass Case B and early massive Case B evolution lead to very discrepant final\nperiods. We show in particular that the lower limit (\u223c 23 d) cannot result from\ncommon\u2013envelope evolution.\nWe discuss the importance of a phase of nonconservative evolution where\nmass and angular momentum can be lost from the system through the ejection\nof matter from accretion disks around the neutron stars in these systems. This\nleads to a dependence of pulsar mass on evolutionary history. In particular,\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nmost low\u2013mass X\u2013ray binaries with orbital periods >\n\u223c 2 days are probably\ntransient; the super\u2013Eddington accretion rates likely during outbursts mean\nthat the neutron stars in such systems gain relatively little mass.\n\nSubject headings: binaries: close - stars: evolution -- stars: neutron -pulsars: general\n\n1.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nEver since the discovery of the 1.55 ms radio pulsar PSR 1937+21 by Backer et al.\n(1982), the study of millisecond pulsars has yielded fundamental insights into the properties\nof neutron stars and to their evolution in binary star systems. In order to determine the\nstatistical properties of the population, numerous radio surveys have been undertaken\nrecently covering both the northern hemisphere (e.g., Camilo 1999) and southern hemisphere\n(Manchester et al. 1996: Lyne et al. 1998). The discovery that many pulsars of this class\nare members of binary systems confirmed the hypothesis that the underlying neutron star\nhad accreted mass and been recycled to short spin period (Radhakrishnan and Srinivasan\n1982; Alpar et al. 1982). The recent discovery of the 2.49 ms coherent pulse period in the\nX-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 by Wijnands and van der Klis (1998) and the discovery of\nits orbital period of 2.01 hours by Chakrabarty and Morgan (1998) provided the first direct\nobservational link between the two classes of systems confirming that the progenitors of\nthese systems are, indeed, low mass X-ray binaries. For a review of the properties of the\nmillisecond binary pulsars see the paper by Phinney and Kulkarni (1994).\nA compilation of binary millisecond radio pulsars by Camilo (1995, 1999) and more\nrecent data reported in Manchester et al. (2000), Edwards (2000), and Tauris, van den\nHeuvel, & Savonije (2000) reveals a population of 35 galactic binary pulsars with almost\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\ncircular orbits and orbital periods ranging from about 2 hours to 175 days (see Table 1).\nIt is found that the distribution of systems with respect to orbital period is non uniform,\nand that there is a significant absence of systems between about 23 and 56 days. This\nis illustrated in Fig. 1 in the form of a cumulative distribution of the orbital periods.\nSince it is not likely that the absence of systems in this period interval reflects a selection\neffect in their discovery (Camilo 1995; Bhattacharya 1996), its origin must provide insights\nto the evolutionary channels of these pulsar systems. Recently, Tauris (1996) examined\nthe possibility that the observed \"period gap\" reflected the operation of a bifurcation\nmechanism in their formation associated with distinct evolutionary histories. In particular,\nthe long period systems were attributed to the evolution of low mass systems along the red\ngiant branch as shown by Joss and Rappaport (1983), Paczynski (1983), and Savonije (1983)\nfollowing earlier work by Taam (1983) and Webbink, Rappaport, & Savonije (1983). On\nthe other hand, the short period systems were assumed to be produced from short period\n(P < 2 days) low mass X-ray binary systems which evolve to ever shorter orbital periods\nunder the action of angular momentum loss associated with magnetic braking (see Pylyser\n& Savonije 1988), and from long period (P > 100 days) X-ray binaries which underwent\na phase of common envelope evolution (van den Heuvel and Taam 1984). In this picture,\nthe pulsar companions are primarily helium white dwarfs in the long period population\nand a mixture of helium and carbon-oxygen white dwarfs in the short period population.\nThe lower edge of the long period group (at \u223c 56 days) is attributable to the evolution of\nsystems above the bifurcation period dividing converging from diverging systems, see \u00a72.1.1\nbelow (\u223c 2 days, Tauris 1996). The upper period edge of the short period group (at \u223c 20\ndays) is assumed to be the maximum orbital period for systems emerging from the common\nenvelope phase.\nIn this paper, we reexamine these conjectures in light of the additional formation\nchannel involving early massive Case B evolution recently identified by King & Ritter\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n(1999), and the current theory of common envelope evolution (Iben & Livio 1993; Taam\n& Sandquist 2000). The description of the evolutionary paths as applied to the binary\nmillisecond pulsars is presented in \u00a72 and an interpretation of the orbital distribution and\nperiod gap in terms of the evolutionary processes is discussed in the final section.\nAfter our paper was submitted (July 1999) two further papers (Tauris & Savonije,\n1999; Tauris, van den Heuvel & Savonije, 2000) relevant to this subject appeared. We refer\nextensively to these papers in what follows.\n\n2.\n\nEVOLUTIONARY MODELS\n\nIn this section the contributions of the various formation channels to the binary\nmillisecond pulsar stage are elucidated. To place them into context the individual paths are\ndescribed in some detail. Low mass Case B, early massive Case B, and common envelope\nevolution are presented in turn.\n\n2.1.\n\nCase B Evolution\n\nIn this phase of evolution, mass transfer is driven by stellar expansion accompanying\ncore contraction and the establishment of a hydrogen burning shell prior to the ignition of\nhelium in the core. The three distinct formation channels associated with this phase can be\ntermed early low mass, late low mass, and early massive evolutions. Here, low mass refers\nto stars (M < 2.25M\u2299 ) which develop a helium degenerate core and massive refers to stars\ndeveloping a nondegenerate core.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n2.1.1. Early Low Mass\nIf mass transfer is initiated close to the main sequence, corresponding to initial orbital\nperiods <\n\u223c 1 day, the binary evolution is affected by angular momentum loss processes\nassociated with a magnetically coupled stellar wind (e.g., Verbunt & Zwaan 1981). The\neffectiveness of the tidal interaction between the components enforces synchronism, thus\ndraining orbital angular momentum from the system. As a consequence, mass transfer is\nenhanced (producing a brighter low mass X-ray binary than would have been the case in\nthe absence of such processes) and the system evolves to shorter orbital periods (Pylyser &\nSavonije 1988). Provided that the mass transfer is initiated for a sufficiently evolved star\nsuch that a degenerate core has formed the system can become detached producing a binary\npulsar system (otherwise, the system continues its evolution as a low mass X-ray binary).\nFor the masses relevant to the binary pulsar evolutions, the critical period (i.e., Pbif in\nthe language of Pylyser & Savonije 1988) is about 0.4 - 0.8 days in the mass conservative\ncase. The actual value for the bifurcation period is dependent on the detailed assumptions\nconcerning mass and angular momentum loss from the system. Specifically, in the case of\na strong consequential angular momentum loss the bifurcation period can be significantly\nlonger than in the conservative case (e.g. Ergma et al. 1998).\n\n2.1.2. Late Low Mass\nIn contrast to the above, binary stars with initial orbital periods greater than Pbif\nevolve into low mass X-ray binary systems with increasing orbital periods (Taam 1983;\nWebbink et al. 1983). Here, the orbital separation increases as a result of mass transfer\nfrom the less massive component to its neutron star companion. As the mass losing\nstar evolves along the red giant branch the hydrogen rich envelope is depleted through a\ncombination of nuclear evolution and mass loss, eventually leading to the formation of a\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nwhite dwarf remnant in a wide detached binary. Since the radius of a giant is primarily a\nfunction of its core mass, the evolution can be described analytically (Ritter 1999). Based\non the core mass radius relation for Population I composition of Rappaport et al. (1995),\nthe relationship between the initial (Pi ) and final (Pf ) orbital periods, expressed in days, for\nmass transfer driven by nuclear evolution in the conservative mass transfer approximation is\nlog Pf (d) = 1.31 + 0.70 log Pi (d)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere it has been assumed that the neutron star has an initial mass, M1,i = 1.4M\u2299 and\nthe low mass companion has an initial mass M2,i = 1M\u2299 . On the other hand, if the mass\ntransfer process is non-conservative such that all the transferred mass is ejected with\nthe specific orbital angular momentum of the neutron star, then the relationship with\nM1 = 1.4M\u2299 , M2,i = 1M\u2299 is\nlog Pf (d) = 1.45 + 0.69 log Pi (d).\n\n(2)\n\nThe correlation between the final orbital period and remnant white dwarf mass, MW D , is\ngiven by\nPf (d) \u223c\n\n5.5\n8.5 \u00d7 104 MWD\n3\n4\n(1 + MWD\n+ 1.75MWD\n)1.5\n\n(3)\n\n(see King & Ritter 1999) where the white dwarf mass is expressed in M\u2299 . For Population\nII composition (which may be appropriate for millisecond pulsars with spindown ages\nexceeding several Gyr), the corresponding eqn. 6 of Rappaport et al. (1995) leads to\nperiods which are smaller than the estimate (3) by about a factor 2.\nWe note that Tauris & Savonije (1999) have recently recalculated low mass Case B\nevolution using newer input physics. In particular this produces binary millisecond pulsars\nwith Porb \u2243 1 d and MWD \u2243 0.2M\u2299 , which were missing from the results of Rappaport et\nal. (1995).\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n2.1.3. Early Massive\nThis type of evolution (see Kippenhahn & Weigert 1967) describes a binary in which\nthe mass losing component has a radiative envelope and is sufficiently massive that helium\nis ignited under nondegenerate conditions (M >\n\u223c 2.25M\u2299 ). As applied to binary pulsars (see\nKing & Ritter 1999) any mass transferred to the neutron star at rates above the Eddington\nlimit is assumed to be ejected from the inner regions of an accretion disk in the form of a\nwind. This implies that the mass of the neutron star is little changed during this thermal\ntimescale phase. The mass transfer is interrupted either by the complete loss of the envelope\nor by the contraction of the nondegenerate component within its Roche lobe when helium\nis ignited at its center. In these evolutions, the ultimate fate of the binary is dictated by\nthe initial mass ratio of the donor to the gainer. For initial mass ratios q = Mdonor /MNS\nslightly smaller than a critical mass ratio (which depends on the donor star's initial mass\nand on the initial orbital separation), the evolving star detaches from its Roche lobe with a\nthick hydrogen rich envelope. Further evolution of the star to its double shell burning phase\nleads to the resumption of mass transfer and to the expansion of the orbit. The depletion\nof the envelope on the asymptotic giant branch leads to the contraction of the core and to\nthe formation of a CO white dwarf with a neutron star companion in a long period orbit\n(<\n\u223c 50 \u2212 70 d, cf figs 2 and 4 of Tauris et al., 2000). For the critical mass ratio the donor\ndetaches from its Roche lobe with a thin hydrogen envelope. Near the end of mass transfer\nsuch an evolution leads to a system resembling Cyg X-2, with an orbital period of \u223c 10\ndays and to the eventual formation of a binary pulsar system consisting of a CO white\ndwarf and a neutron star similar to J0621+1002 (King & Ritter 1999). Finally, for systems\ncharacterized by initial mass ratios much greater than the critical value, mass transfer\nremoves the entire hydrogen rich envelope and the remnant helium star directly evolves\nto form a CO white dwarf. For this type of evolution, larger initial mass ratios result in\nshorter orbital periods for the binary pulsar system and to more massive CO white dwarf\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\ncompanions (King & Ritter 1999). An approximate relation for the minimum final period\nexpressed in days for such systems is given by\nlog Pf \u2248 2.56 \u2212 3.1\n\nMWD\nM\u2299\n\n(4)\n\nyielding, for example, a maximum of \u223c 30 days for the minimum mass of a CO white dwarf\n(0.35M\u2299 ) produced in this evolution.\n\n2.2.\n\nCommon Envelope Evolution\n\nSystems evolving through the common envelope phase can also contribute to the binary\nmillisecond pulsar population (see Taam & Sandquist 2000). In such systems the mass\ntransfer is unstable, leading to the formation of a differentially rotating common envelope.\nThis evolution is particularly relevant to binary systems characterized by a large mass ratio\nand a giant star component. For sufficiently large mass ratios, the binary is subject to a\ntidal instability (Darwin 1879; Kopal 1972; Counselman 1973; Hut 1980) occuring when the\norbital angular momentum of the binary is less than 3 times the spin angular momentum\nof the giant star. For orbital separations less than a critical value, where the total angular\nmomentum is a minimum, the two stars must spiral together. Progenitor systems can also\nevolve into a common envelope provided that the envelope of the nondegenerate component\nis convective. In this case, the envelope can expand upon mass loss for evolutionary stages\nwhere the fractional mass in the convective envelope exceeds 0.5 (Hjellming 1989). For\nmass ratios >\n\u223c 1.2 \u2212 1.5 a giant cannot be constrained within its Roche lobe and a runaway\nmass transfer episode is expected.\nSuccessful ejection of the envelope without requiring the two stars to merge can be\nachieved given that sufficient energy is released from the orbital motion and that the mass\nlosing star is sufficiently evolved (see Taam & Sandquist 2000). The outcome of such an\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nevolution would resemble a short\u2013period binary pulsar like PSR 0655+64 (van den Heuvel\n& Taam 1984). For an interaction of a neutron star with a companion on the first ascent\nred giant branch a helium white dwarf companion of mass >\n\u223c 0.2 \u2212 0.25M\u2299 is expected\n(Sandquist, Taam, & Burkert 2000; see also Sarna, Marks, & Smith 1996). On the other\nhand, an interaction on the asymptotic giant branch leads to a CO white dwarf with mass\n>\n\u223c 0.55M\u2299 . We note that the evolution into a common envelope phase is less likely for a\nstar characterized by a radiative envelope (since the star contracts upon mass loss) and\nfor mass ratios not significantly larger than unity (where the mass ratio can be reversed,\nleading to orbital expansion).\nThe upper limit to the orbital period for the short-period population of binary\nmillisecond pulsars has been identified with the outcome of common envelope evolution\n(Tauris 1996). Although evolution via a common envelope may be expected to populate\nthe region at short orbital periods (<\n\u223c a few days), there is insufficient orbital energy to\nproduce a system with a period as long as 20 days for the intermediate mass progenitors\ncharacteristic of the white dwarf component in the system. To circumvent this difficulty,\nTauris (1996) had to increase the efficiency of mass ejection in the common envelope phase\nsignificantly above unity (i.e. to 4). At the time the cutoff was 12 days: the current value\nof 23 days (J1618-3919) exacerbates the problem if we assume that this system also evolved\nthrough a CE phase. Tauris (1996) invoked unspecified sources of energy to accommodate\nthis choice; however, the ionization energy and nuclear energy sources that have been\ninvoked in the past are ineffective (see Sandquist et al. 2000). Specifically, the ionization\nenergy cannot be tapped directly (see Harpaz 1998) and is unimportant for ejecting matter\nin the deep gravitational potential of the binary where the major phase of mass ejection\ntakes place. Nuclear energy is tapped on a timescale too long compared to the mass ejection\ntimescale to be important.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nOne might try to get round this argument by assuming that systems such as J1618-3919\nhave low\u2013mass helium white dwarf companions. However this is ruled out because the fairly\nlarge values of Pspin (32.82 ms, 71.09 ms) for J1810-2005 and J1904+04 (Porb = 15.0 d and\n15.75 d respectively), as well as the large value of \u1e56spin for J1810-2005, strongly indicate\nthat these systems passed through a phase of very high mass transfer and that the neutron\nstar cannot have accreted much matter. Since CE evolution is probably ruled out by the\nargument of the last paragraph, we conclude that the short Porb population below the gap,\nbut longer than a few days must be the result of early massive Case B evolution.\n\n3.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nGiven the possible evolutionary channels for the formation of binary millisecond pulsars\npresented in the previous section, we consider their implications for the period distribution\nof these systems. As described in \u00a72, it is unlikely that the common envelope path is\nresponsible for the period cutoff of the short period systems and therefore that the efficiency\nfor mass ejection greater than unity is required. We suggest that the cutoff near 23 days is a\nnatural consequence of the early massive Case B evolution near the critical mass ratio (see\nKing & Ritter 1999). The lower period cutoff for the long period systems is likely to result\nfrom low mass Case B evolution, but it is not related to the bifurcation mechanism favored\nby Tauris (1996) since a bifurcation period at 2 days requires angular momentum loss rates\nsignificantly greater than commonly believed. On the contrary, we suggest that this period\ndistribution is a natural consequence of the small phase space available to those systems\nwhich evolve into the 20 - 60 day period interval. That is, although the formation of binary\nmillisecond pulsars with orbital periods as short as 20 days is possible in this evolutionary\nchannel, it is not likely, since the initial core mass of the progenitor must be very low, i.e.\n\u223c 0.17M\u2299 . The initial orbital period corresponding to this evolution is \u223c 1 day. As pointed\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nout by Tauris (1996) such systems evolve to shorter orbital periods because of angular\nmomentum losses associated with a magnetized stellar wind (Pylyser and Savonije 1988).\nFor those systems which do not evolve to shorter periods, the final period is extremely\nsensitive to the initial period at which mass transfer is initiated. For example, small initial\ncore masses (\u223c 0.2M\u2299 ) yield orbital periods >\n\u223c 60 days for initial orbital periods of about 3\ndays. We suggest that the small range of core masses means that only a few systems can\nfinish their evolution with a period in the range of 20 \u2013 60 days.\nImplicit in the evolutionary scenarios we discuss, and especially important for\nunderstanding the short period population (\u223c 1 \u2212 20 days), is the assumption that the\nneutron star accretes only a small fraction of the transferred mass because accretion on to\nthe neutron star is likely to occur at super\u2013Eddington rates. This occurs either because\n8\nthe mass transfer timescale is <\n\u223c 10 years or because matter is accreted at high rates in a\n\ntransient manner. This latter circumstance probably results from a thermal instability in\nthe accretion disk (King, Kolb, & Burderi 1996; King, Kolb, & Szuszkiewicz 1997; Li, van\nden Heuvel, & Wang 1998). The orbital separations of long\u2013period low\u2013mass X\u2013ray binaries\n(LMXBs) imply very large accretion disks, whose outer regions cannot be maintained in the\nhot (ionized) state, even by self\u2013irradiation via X\u2013rays. Thus all LMXBs with Porb >\n\u223c2d\nare probably transient (King, Kolb & Burderi, 1996). In this case, accretion on to the\nneutron star occurs only during outbursts. A short outburst duty cycle, as inferred from\nobservation, implies super\u2013Eddington central accretion rates. Only a small fraction is\naccreted, while the remainder is ejected as a wind. Calculations neglecting this mass loss\npredict final neutron star masses systematically larger than the upper limits on the observed\nmasses, often by several times 0.1M\u2299 , cf Fig. 4b of Tauris & Savonije (1999).\nEjection is unlikely at short periods because most neutron star systems are persistent,\nalthough transients do exist, e.g., SAX J1808.4-3658 (Chakrabarty & Morgan 1998) at 2\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nhours and EXO 0748-676 (Parmar et al. 1986) at 3.8 hours (cf King et al. 1996; King\n& Kolb 1997). In this case, the neutron star gains mass and is likely to be spun up to\nmillisecond periods.\nGiven the circumstances under which mass can be transferred at high rates, one can\nexpect that the mass of the pulsar is dependent on the particular evolutionary path leading\nto its formation. As the mass transfer rates driven by nuclear evolution of highly luminous\ngiant stars exceed the Eddington rate, the neutron stars in the long period population\nare not likely to have accreted much matter. That is, the neutron star components in\nthose systems which have been formed via the low mass Case B and intermediate early\nmassive Case B evolutionary channels are likely to have accreted little mass, and should\ndiffer little from their formation masses. Likewise, the neutron stars that evolve through\na common envelope phase are also not likely to have accreted much matter. Although it\nhas been hypothesized that they can accrete sufficient matter in the neutrino dominated\nregime (Zeldovich, Ivanova & Nadyozhin 1972) to form black holes (Chevalier 1993; Brown\n1995), recent studies (Chevalier 1996) indicate that neutron stars are expected to survive\nwhen account is taken of rotational effects in highly evolved giants. In this context, the\nmore evolved state of the giant companion makes it less likely that the neutrino accretion\ndominated regime is reached. The lower rates of accretion characteristic of the lower density\nenvelopes of more evolved stars, in combination with the short evolutionary phase of the\ncommon envelope (<\n\u223c 10 \u2212 100 years) suggest that accretion is not important. On the other\nhand, pulsars in systems with short orbital periods (<\n\u223c 1 day) should be more massive than\nthe other pulsars in their class since the mass transfer rates are less than the Eddington\nvalue. The observational measurement and improved estimates of pulsar masses in such\nsystems following up on the work by Thorsett & Chakrabarty (1999) is highly desirable for\ntesting such an evolutionary dependence.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nThis research was initiated at the Institute of Theoretical Physics and was supported in part\nby the National Science Foundation under Grant No. PHY94-07194, and at Northwestern\nUniversity by NSF grant AST-9727875.
