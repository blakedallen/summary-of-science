Krishan and Z. Yoshida\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIt is widely recognized that some ideal integrals of motion (i.e., constants of motion in the\ndissipation-less limit) play an essential role in the complex nonlinear dynamics leading to\nremarkable self-organizing structures. The \"helicity\" is one such quantity that imposes a\n\"topological\" constraint on a field Moffat (1978). Constancy of the helicity is not attributed\nto any \"symmetry\" of the system, but is due to a \"defect\" (or a singularity) of the Poissonbracket operator, and, thus, is a robust constraint throughout the evolution.\nA dissipative mechanism can change the helicity to remove the topological constraint.\nSelf-organization may be understood as a subtle balance between the conservation (restriction) and the dissipation (relaxation).\nOne of the most successful models of self-organization is due to Taylor (1974), who\ninvoked the constancy of the magnetic helicity H = A * B d3 x/2 (the integral is taken over\nR\n\nthe total volume). Minimizing the magnetic energy E =\n\nR\n\n|B|2 d3 x/2 (he omitted the kinetic\n\nand the thermal energies) for a fixed H yields an Euler-Lagrange equation \u2207\u00d7B = \u03bbB (\u03bb is\nthe Lagrange multiplier for restricting H), whose solution is the \"Beltrami field\" representing\na twisted force-free magnetic field. The cross helicity Hc =\n\nR\n\nV * B d3 x/2 is also an invariant\n\nof the ideal magnetohydrodynamic system with flows where V is the fluid velocity.\nThis \"variational principle\" is based on the assumption that the energy E is preferentially\n(selectively) dissipated while the helicity H is approximately conserved (and that no other\nconserved quantity puts an obstacle for the minimization of E). A possible justification\nfor this assumption is given by the \"energy cascade\" ansatz -the energy density of the\nfluctuating field cascades toward small spatial scales, and the variations (spatial derivatives)\nof the field are enhanced. Then, the dissipation of the energy, which includes higher-order\nspatial derivatives in comparison with the helicity, proceeds much faster than that of the\nhelicity. This \"scale change\" of fluctuations may be represented by the cascade of the energy\ndensity in the Fourier (wave number) space.\nIt has been established that E and H are the integrals of motion of an ideal magnetohydrodynamic system, the energy cascade yields the selective dissipation of the energy (with\nrespect to the helicity) leading to the Taylor relaxed state. This paper extends the scope\nof these considerations to \"weakly ionized plasmas\". There are many astrophysical systems\nwith a rather low degree of ionization dominated by the charged particle-neutral collisions\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: vinod@iiap.res.in\n\n\fKolmogorov Dissipation scales in Weakly Ionized Plasmas\n\n3\n\nand the neutral particle dynamics. A major part of the solar photosphere (Leake and Arber\n2006; Krishan and Varghese 2008;), the protoplanetary disks (Krishan and Yoshida 2006) and\nthe molecular clouds (Brandenburg and Zweibel 1994) are some of the examples of weakly\nionized astrophysical plasmas. In addition these systems are believed to be turbulent. The\nevolution of the magnetic fields in such a plasma would be affected by the multifluid interactions in general and the ambipolar diffusion in particular (Zweibel 1988). It is important\nto know which dissipation scale would be the most effective in a given situation.\nHere, We (1) set up the energy and the helicity evolution equations in a weakly ionized plasma and (2)determine the Kolmogorov dissipation scales for the different energy\ndissipation mechanisms. The weakly ionized part of the solar atmosphere is presented as an\nexample to illustrate the predominance of one or the other dissipation scale. We show that\nthe ambipolar effect, which is nonlinearly enhanced when the energy injection rate is large,\nmay dominate the energy dissipation, while it conserves the helicity.\n\n2\n\nENERGY AND HELICITIES IN WEAKLY IONIZED PLASMAS\n\nThe dynamics of a weakly ionized plasma can be described with the following equations (\nKrishan and Yoshida 2006, Krishan and Varghese 2008, Krishan and Gangadhara, 2008 ):\nthe momentum balance of the neutral fluid is given by:\nJ \u00d7B\n\u2202V\n+ (V * \u2207)V = \u2212\u2207h +\n+ \u03bc\u22072 V ,\n\u2202t\nc\u03c1n\n\n(1)\n\nand the magnetic field B evolves as:\n\u2202B\n=\u2207\u00d7\n\u2202t\n\n(\"\n\n#\n\n)\n\nJ\nJ \u00d7B\n\u00d7 B + \u03b7\u22072 B.\nV \u2212\n+\nene\nc\u03bdin \u03c1i\n\n(2)\n\nand\n\u2207\u00d7B =\n\n4\u03c0\nJ\nc\n\n(3)\n\nwhere V is the velocity of the neutral fluid and h is the total enthalpy. The Lorentz force in\nthe neutral dynamics appears due to the ion- neutral coupling in that the Lorentz force on\nV \u00d7B\nthe ions (eni (E +  \u0304 ic  \u0304 )) is balanced by the ion-neutral collisional force (\u2212\u03c1i \u03bdin (Vi \u2212 Vn ))\n \u0304\n \u0304\n \u0304\nwhere \u03bdin is the ion- neutral collision frequency. The ion inertial force has been neglected\nin comparison with the ion-neutral frictional force. The viscosity \u03bc of the neutral fluid\narises due to neutral-neutral collisions with frequency \u03bdnn . The electron inertial force is also\nneglected. We have further assumed a constant density incompressible system. We may write\nthe electric diffusivity \u03b7 as:\n\n\f4\n\nV. Krishan and Z. Yoshida\n\n\u03b7=\n\nc2 me \u03bden\n= \u03b4e2 \u03bden ,\n4\u03c0 ne e2\n\n(4)\n\nand the kinematic viscosity \u03bc as:\n2\nvn,th\n= \u03bb2n \u03bdnn ,\n\u03bdnn\n\n\u03bc=\n\n(5)\nq\n\nwhere \u03b4e := c/\u03c9pe = c/ 4\u03c0ne e2 /me is the electron inertial length, and \u03bbn := vn,th /\u03bdnn is the\nneutral mean free path: \u03bden , \u03bdnn and \u03bdei are the electron-neutral, the neutral-neutral, and\nthe electron-ion collision frequencies; \u03bdei << \u03bden in the case of the weakly ionized plasma.\nAssuming constant densities and incompressibility, we normalize the variables in the\n\"Alfv\u00e9nic units\". We chose a representative neutral flow velocity V0 and a magnetic field B0\nrelated as:\n\u03c1n V02\nB2\n= 0.\n2\n8\u03c0\n\n(6)\n\nSolving (6) for V0 gives a virtual Alfv\u00e9nic velocity V0 = B0 /(4\u03c0\u03c1n )1/2 . If \u03c1n were \u03c1i , this V0\nis the well-known Alfv\u00e9n velocity. In a weakly ionized plasma,\n\u03b1 :=\n\n\u03c1n\n\u226b1\n\u03c1i\n\n(7)\n\nFor example, in the solar atmosphere, \u03b1 can be as large as 106 , the protoplanetary disks\nhave \u03b1 of the order of 108 .\nLet L0 be a characteristic length in the system. We normalize x by L0 , t by t0 := L0 /V0 ,\nB by B0 , V by V0 and energy densities by \u03c1n V02 = B02 /(8\u03c0). Using these variables, Equations\n(1) and (2) can be written in the (1) and (2) dimension-less form:\n\u2202V\n+ (V * \u2207)V = \u2212\u2207h + J \u00d7 B + \u01eb\u03bc \u22072 V ,\n\u2202t\n\u2202B\n= \u2207 \u00d7 {[V \u2212 \u01ebH J + \u01ebA J \u00d7 B] \u00d7 B} + \u01eb\u03b7 \u22072 B,\n\u2202t\n\n(8)\n(9)\n\nwhere the scaling parameters are defined as:\nc/\u03c9pi\n\u03b4i\n=\u03b1 ,\nL0\nL0\n\u03c9ci\n:= \u01ebH ,\n\u03bdin\n1\nt0\n,\n:= \u03b7 2 = \u03b7\nL0\nL0 V0\nt0\n1\n:= \u03bc 2 = \u03bc\n,\nL0\nL0 V0\n\n\u01ebH := \u03b1\n\n(10)\n\n\u01ebA\n\n(11)\n\n\u01eb\u03b7\n\u01eb\u03bc\n\n(12)\n(13)\n\nHere, \u03b4i is the ion inertial length. The scaling parameter \u01ebH multiplying the Hall term is\nenhanced by the factor \u03b1 = \u03c1n /\u03c1i in comparison with the standard (fully ionized) Hall term.\n\n\fKolmogorov Dissipation scales in Weakly Ionized Plasmas\n\n5\n\nWith an appropriate homogeneous boundary conditions, we have the energy equation\n(E = (V 2 + B 2 )dx/2),\nR\n\ndE\n= \u2212\u01ebA\ndt\n\nZ\n\nJ\u22a52 B 2 d3 x \u2212 \u01eb\u03b7\n\nZ\n\nJ 2 d3 x \u2212 \u01eb\u03bc\n\nZ\n\n|\u2207 \u00d7 V |2 d3 x,\n\nand, for completeness, the helicity equation (H =\ndH\n= \u2212\u01eb\u03b7\ndt\n\nZ\n\nJ * B d3 x.\n\nR\n\n(14)\n\nA * Bdx/2)\n(15)\n\nIn the ideal limit (\u01ebA = 0, \u01eb\u03b7 = 0 and \u01eb\u03bc = 0), E and H are conserved. The constancy\nof H is destroyed only by a finite resistivity \u01eb\u03b7 . The cross helicity Hc of the ideal MHD\ntransforms to the ion canonical helicity HG = (A + \u01ebH V ) * \u2207 \u00d7 (A + \u01ebH V )dx/2. The cross\nR\n\nhelicity Hc is conserved when \u01ebH = 0, \u01ebA = 0 and the ion helicity HG is conserved for \u01ebA = 0.\nFor \u01ebA 6= 0 both Hc and HG are not conserved. From (14), we find that the energy dissipation\nis contributed by (i) ambipolar diffusion (scaled by \u01ebA ), (ii) resistivity (friction of electrons\nwith neutrals; scaled by \u01eb\u03b7 ), and (iii) neutral viscosity (scaled by \u01eb\u03bc ).The advective terms\n(V * \u2207)V , \u2207 \u00d7 (V \u00d7 B) and \u2207 \u00d7 (J \u00d7 B) ( the Hall term ) are responsible for the energy\ncascade mechanism. Since the velocity and the magnetic field are coupled through equations\n(8) and (9), all the advective and the dissipative processes operate on both the velocity\nand the magnetic fields. We shall define the Reynolds number in a rather broad sense as\nthe ratio of the advective term and the dissipation term. We will see that the Reynolds\nnumbers resulting from different combinations of the advective process and the dissipation\nprocess set up a rather complex scale hierarchy of the Kolmogorov microscale, in the wave\nnumber (k) space, which changes depending on the strength of the energy injection rate.\nIn what follows we will select one dissipation mechanism and combine it with the three\nadvective ( cascading) mechanisms to define the three Reynolds numbers and determine the\ncorresponding Kolmogorov microscales.\n\n3\n\nSCALE HIERARCHY\n\nThe wave-number (k) space is divided into (i) the energy injection (large scale) range, (ii)\nthe \"inertial range\", and (iii) the dissipation range. The inertial range is dominated by the\nconvective [(V * \u2207)V ], inductive [\u2207 \u00d7 (V \u00d7 B)] and the Hall [\u2212\u2207 \u00d7 (\u01ebH J \u00d7 B)] effects,\nwhich create a sub-hierarchy in the inertial range. The higher-k-end of the inertial range\nis the \"Kolmogorov scale\" that is determined by one of the three (ambipolar, viscous and\n\n\f6\n\nV. Krishan and Z. Yoshida\n\nresistive) dissipation mechanisms. The aim of this section is to estimate the Kolmogorov\nscale by identifying the responsible (i.e., the dominant) mechanism of energy dissipation.\nHere we invoke Kolmogorov's ansatz of \"local interactions\" in the k-space, which may\nbe formulated as follows. Let K symbolize a \"range\" of wave-number space, i.e., K stands\nfor {k; K 6 |k| < K + \u2206}, where k is the wave vector and \u2206 is a certain positive constant.\nDenoting by \u00fb(k) the Fourier transform of a field u(x), we define uK =\n\nP\n\nk\u2208K\n\n\u00fb(k)eik*x, which\n\nmeans the component of u(x) in the hierarchy of wave-numbers ranging in K. Suppose a\nterm X is included in an evolution equation of a physical quantity u. When we observe the\nhierarchy K, XK contributes the temporal variation (\u2202u/\u2202t)K . If X is a linear term including\na field v (and, possibly, the differential operator \u2207), then we may estimate XK only by vK .\nBut, if X includes, for example, v * w, then all v\u0302(k1 ) and \u0175(k2 ) (and the corresponding \u2207\ntranslating into ik1 and ik2 ) may contribute to XK , if k1 \u00b1 k2 \u2208 K. Now, the \"locality\nansatz\" claims that only vK and wK (and, thus, \u2207 of order K) dominates XK . We assume\nthat this ansatz holds for all (even higher-order) nonlinear terms in our system. We also\nassume that no geometric anisotropy diminishes the magnitudes of vector products such as\nJ \u00d7 B. Hence, we estimate, for example, |J \u00d7 B|K \u2248 |J |K |B|K \u2248 K|B|2K (using J = \u2207 \u00d7 B\nin the normalized unit). In what follows, we denote |B|K by BK .\n3.1\n\nKolmogorov scales defined by viscosity dissipation\n\nUsing a rather general definition of the Reynolds number as the ratio of the term responsible\nfor the cascade process to that responsible for the dissipation process, we consider, first, the\nadvective term (V * \u2207)V and the dissipation due to the viscosity. This defines the very\nfamiliar, the (standard) Kolmogorov scale, when the other mechanisms (ambipolar diffusion\nand resistivity) are still negligible.\nThe Reynolds number is defined by\n|(V * \u2207)V |K\n.\n(16)\nR\u03bc (K) :=\n|\u01eb\u03bc \u22072 V |K\nNote that this Reynolds number is evaluated for each scale hierarchy as a function of K.\nInvoking the previous assumptions, we estimate\nVK\n.\n(17)\nR\u03bc (K) \u2248\n\u01eb\u03bc K\nThe \"Kolmogorov microscale\" is usually defined as the spatial scale l at which the Reynolds\nnumber becomes unity ( e.g. Holmes, Lumley and Berkoz 1996, Frisch 1995 ). We prefer\nto work in the wavevector space such that K = l\u22121 and define the inverse Kolmogorov\n\n\fKolmogorov Dissipation scales in Weakly Ionized Plasmas\n\n7\n\nmicroscale K = K\u03bc where R\u03bc (K) becomes of the order of unity ( e.g. Pope 2000). We\nobtain\nK\u03bc =\n\nVK \u03bc\n.\n\u01eb\u03bc\n\n(18)\n\nTo estimate (eliminate) VK\u03bc , we invoke the energy cascade rate ( total energy E being an\ninvariant of the system) E ( normalized by E0 = V03 /L0 ) that is assumed to be scale invariant\nand equal to the energy dissipation rate as well as the energy injection rate. From Eq.(13)\nE = \u01eb\u03bc K\u03bc2 VK2\u03bc =\n\nVK4 \u03bc\n.\n\u01eb\u03bc\n\n(19)\n\nSolving (19) for VK\u03bc , we obtain\nVK\u03bc = E 1/4 \u01eb\u03bc 1/4 .\n\n(20)\n\nSubstituting (20) into (18) yields the well-known relation\nK\u03bc = E 1/4 \u01eb\u03bc \u22123/4 .\n\n(21)\n\nIf the energy cascade is dominated by the advective term \u2207 \u00d7 (V \u00d7 B) and the dissipation\nby the viscosity; the Reynolds number R\u03bcM (K) should better represent the relation between\nthe energy cascade and the dissipation where\nR\u03bcM (K) :=\n\nBK\nVK\n|\u2207 \u00d7 (V \u00d7 B)|K\n,\n\u2248\n=\n\u01eb\u03bc |\u22072 V |K\n\u01eb\u03bc K\n\u01eb\u03bc KCV /B\n\n(22)\n\nwhere we have introduced a coefficient CV /B := VK /BK that is, in general, a function of K.\nThe corresponding Kolmogorov scale becomes\nBK\u03bcM\nVK\u03bcM\nK\u03bcM =\n= E 1/4 \u01eb\u03bc \u22123/4 CV\u22121/B .\n=\n\u01eb\u03bc\n\u01eb\u03bc CV /B\n\n(23)\n\nIn the ideal MHD regime, however, we may assume CV /B \u2248 1 throughout the MHD inertial range, because the energy transfer is an equal collaboration of the induction and the\nconvection terms. Hence, K\u03bcM \u2248 K\u03bc .\nThe situation changes, when the Hall term dominates the energy cascade. This is the\ncase if the ion skin depth multiplied by the density ratio \u03b1, \u01ebH (normalized by the system\nsize) is larger than the Kolmogorov length scale, i.e., \u01ebH K\u03bc > 1. One can define the Hall\nReynolds number by taking the advective term \u01ebH J \u00d7 B ( the Hall term) and the dissipative\nterm to be due to the viscosity. The corresponding Reynolds number is defined as\nR\u03bcH (K) :=\n\n2\n|\u01ebH \u2207 \u00d7 (J \u00d7 B)|K\n\u01ebH BK\n\u01ebH VK\n\u2248\n=\n2\n\u01eb\u03bc |\u2207 V |K\n\u01eb\u03bc VK\n\u01eb\u03bc CV2 /B\n\n(24)\n\nscales the ratio of the energy cascade rate and the dissipation. Assuming CV /B = (\u01ebH K)p\n(for K > 1/\u01ebH ) with a certain exponent p (the Hall-MHD turbulence theory, Krishan and\n\n\f8\n\nV. Krishan and Z. Yoshida\n\nMahajan 2005, predicts, for R-mode turbulence p = 1, while for L-mode turbulence p = \u22121),\nwe obtain a \"Hall Kolmogorov scale\" (denoting q := 1/(2p))\nK\u03bcH =\n\nVK\u03bcH\n\u01eb\u03bc\n\nq\u22121\n\u01ebH\n\n!q\n\n\u0010\n\nq\u22121\n= \u01ebH\nE 1/4 \u01eb\u03bc \u22123/4\n\n\u0011q\n\n\u0010\n\n= \u01eb\u22121\nH\n\n\u00111\u2212q\n\n(K\u03bc )q .\n\n(25)\n\nSince K\u03bcH /K\u03bc = 1/(\u01ebH K\u03bc )1\u2212q (and we are assuming \u01ebH K\u03bc > 1), K\u03bcH interpolates \u01eb\u22121\nH and\n\u22121\nK\u03bc (i.e., \u01ebH\n< K\u03bcH < K\u03bc ) as long as q < 1.\n\nAs mentioned above, the condition for the appearance of the Hall MHD regime is\n\u01ebH K\u03bc = \u01ebH \u01eb\u03bc \u22123/4 E 1/4 > 1.\n3.2\n\n(26)\n\nKolmogorov scales defined by resistivity dissipation\n\nNext, we examine the case where the resistive dissipation dominates over the viscous and\nthe ambipolar diffusivities. Both the viscous and the resistive dissipations have a common\nmathematical structure viz. they are linear terms multiplied by \u22072 .\nThe resistive and the viscous dissipation mechanisms may be compared as follows: from\n(14), the ratio of the resistive and viscous dissipation terms is\n2\n|\u01eb\u03b7 \u2207 \u00d7 B|2K\n\u01eb\u03b7 K 2 BK\n\u01eb\u03b7\n=\n= CV\u22122/B .\n2\n2\n2\n|\u01eb\u03bc \u2207 \u00d7 V |K\n\u01eb\u03bc K VK\n\u01eb\u03bc\n\n(27)\n\nAgain taking (V *\u2207)V ) as the advective term, in the MHD regime where we may assume\nCV /B \u2248 1, the resistive Kolmogorov scale is given by just replacing \u01eb\u03bc by \u01eb\u03b7 in (21), i.e.,\nK\u03b7 = E 1/4 \u01eb\u03b7 \u22123/4 ,\n\n(28)\n\n2\n. Evaluating E for the same energy injection\nwhere the energy dissipation rate is E = \u01eb\u03b7 K\u03b72 BK\n\u03b7\n\nrate, we may write K\u03b7 = (\u01eb\u03b7 /\u01eb\u03bc )\u22123/4 K\u03bc . By (4) and (5), we estimate\n\u01eb\u03b7\n\u03b4 2 \u03bden\n= e2\n.\n\u01eb\u03bc\n\u03bbn \u03bdnn\n\n(29)\n\nFor the MHD regime where we may assume CV /B \u2248 1 the advective term \u2207 \u00d7 (V \u00d7 B)\nalong with the resistive dissipation furnishes the same scale K\u03b7 .\nIn the Hall MHD regime (\u01ebH K\u03b7 > 1), we replace the previous Hall Reynolds number\n(24) by\nR\u03b7H (K) :=\n\n\u01ebH BK\n|\u01ebH \u2207 \u00d7 (J \u00d7 B)|K\n\u2248\n.\n2\n|\u01eb\u03b7 \u2207 B|K\n\u01eb\u03b7\n\n(30)\n\nHence, at the corresponding Kolmogorov scale K\u03b7H , we estimate BK\u03b7H = \u01eb\u03b7 /\u01ebH . From the\n2\n2\nenergy dissipation rate E = \u01eb\u03b7 K\u03b7H\nBK\n, we obtain\n\u03b7H\n\nK\u03b7H = E 1/2 \u01eb\u22123/2\n\u01ebH = K\u03b72 \u01ebH .\n\u03b7\n\n(31)\n\n\fKolmogorov Dissipation scales in Weakly Ionized Plasmas\n\n9\n\nHence, unlike the relation of the viscosity Kolmogorov scales (25), K\u03b7H > K\u03b7 .\n\n3.3\n\nKolmogorov scales defined by ambipolar diffusion\n\nFinally, we estimate the Kolmogorov scales assuming that the dissipation is dominated by\nthe ambipolar term.\nWe begin with the MHD regime where we may assume CV /B \u2248 1. As shown earlier in this\ncase the advective terms (V * \u2207)V ) and \u2207 \u00d7 (V \u00d7 B) furnish equal Kolmogorov microscales.\nWe define an \"ambipolar Reynolds number\" by\nRA (K) :=\n\nVK\n|\u2207 \u00d7 (V \u00d7 B)|K\n.\n\u2248\n2\n|\u01ebA \u2207 \u00d7 [(J \u00d7 B) \u00d7 B]|K\n\u01ebA KBK\n\n(32)\n\nThe ambipolar Kolmogorov scale KA is characterized by RA (KA ) \u2248 1:\nKA =\n\nCV /B\nVK A\n=\n.\n2\n\u01ebA BKA\n\u01ebA BKA\n\n(33)\n\nThe ambipolar dissipation rate is now ( Eq. 13):\n4\n2\n2\nE = \u01ebA KA2 BK\n= \u01eb\u22121\nA CV /B BKA .\nA\n\n(34)\n\n1/2\n\nPlugging BKA = E 1/2 \u01ebA CV\u22121/B into (33), and assuming CV /B \u2248 1, we obtain\n\u22123/2\n\nKA = \u01ebA\n\nE \u22121/2 .\n\n(35)\n\nLet us compare (35) with (21):\nKA\n\u22123/2 \u22123/4\n= \u01eb3/4\nE\n.\n\u03bc \u01ebA\nK\u03bc\n\n(36)\n\nFrom this relation, we see that the ambipolar diffusion dominates over the viscous dissipation\n(i.e., KA /K\u03bc \u226a 1), when the energy dissipation rate (=energy injection rate) E is sufficiently\nlarge. This is because the ambipolar dissipation is a nonlinear term that is enhanced when\nthe fluctuation level is high.\nIf the Hall term dominates the energy cascade i.e. taking \u01ebH \u2207 \u00d7 (J \u00d7 B as the advective\nterm (\u01ebH KA > 1), we replace (32) by\nRAH (K) :=\n\n|\u01ebH \u2207 \u00d7 (J \u00d7 B)|K\n\u01ebH\n\u2248\n.\n|\u01ebA \u2207 \u00d7 [(J \u00d7 B) \u00d7 B]|K\n\u01ebA BK\n\n(37)\n\n\u22121/2\n\nUsing (34), we estimate BKAH = (E/\u01ebA )1/4 KAH , which, together with RAH (KAH ) = 1 yields\n3/2\n\n1/2\nKAH = \u01ebA \u01eb\u22122\n= (\u01ebH KA )\u22122 KA .\nH E\n\nWe, thus, see KAH < KA .\nComparing with (25), we get:\n\n(38)\n\n\f10\n\nV.

This\nrealization is rather recent and is now receiving a lot of attention. Arber, Haynes and Leake\n(2007) has emphasized the profound effects on the temperature and the current structure\nof the overlying chromosphere and the corona that the inclusion of the neutral medium can\nproduce. It is important to know which dissipation scale would be the most effective for the\nconditions typical of the solar atmosphere. We estimate the various Kolmogorov scales in\nthe partially ionized part of the solar atmosphere.\nThe various collision frequencies are determined from Khodochenko et al.(2004):\n\u03bdij = \u03a3ij nn\n\n8KB T\n\u03c0mij\n\n!1/2\n\n,\n\n(40)\n\nwhere (i,j) stands for the species of particles, the cross-section \u03a3en \u2248 10\u221215 cm2 , \u03a3in \u2248\n\u03a3nn \u2248 5 \u00d7 10\u221215 cm2 , mij = mi mj (mi + mj )\u22121 , nn is the neutral particle density and T is\ntemperature in degree Kelvin.

The Spitzer resistivity in a weakly\nionized plasma, by definition, is much smaller than the resistivity due to the electron-neutral\ncollisions. We conclude that the ambipolar dissipation would dominate over other dissipation\nmechanisms on most of the partially ionized region of the solar atmosphere.\n\n5\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe dynamics of weakly ionized plasmas is governed by the neutral fluid being subjected to\nthe Lorentz force and the magnetic induction to the Hall and and the ambipolar effects. There\nare now three mechanisms by which the energy could dissipate, each mechanism having its\nown characteristic dissipation scale. We have determined these scales as presented in Table I.\nThe example of the solar atmosphere shows that the ambipolar dissipation would determine\nthe short scale end of the supposedly self-similar distribution of the photospheric magnetic\nfield thereby identifying the region of dissipation leading to heating. We observe that H\nis a more robust quantity in comparison with E, if either the ambipolar or the viscous\ndissipation is larger than the resistive dissipation. In the standard argument of selective\ndissipation, moreover, even the resistivity dissipates E faster than it does H because of\nthe energy cascade toward small scales; dE/dt includes higher-order spatial derivatives in\n\n\f14\n\nV.

This\ncould lead to the formation of organized plasma structures, vortical structures with twisted\nmagnetic fields, so ubiquitous on the sun.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors are grateful to Dr. A.B.
