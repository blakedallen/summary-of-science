Imagine bending this string to\nform a circle, so the topology is now S 1 \u00d7 S 2 . In principle this circular string tends to contract,\n\ndecreasing the radius of the S 1 , due to its tension and gravitational self-attraction, but we can\nmake the string rotate along the S 1 and balance these forces against the centrifugal repulsion.\nThen we end up with a neutral rotating black ring. Ref. [1] obtained it as an explicit solution\nof five-dimensional vacuum General Relativity.\nThis heuristic construction was first suggested surprisingly long ago in [2], but several of the\nmost important features of the neutral black ring could hardly have been anticipated without\nthe explicit solution. For fixed mass, the spin of a five-dimensional rotating black hole of\nspherical topology is bounded above [2], whereas the spin of the black ring is bounded below.\nBut the ranges of existence of both sorts of objects overlap, and where they do, one actually\nfinds two black rings, in addition to the black hole, all with the same mass and spin. This\ntriplicity of solutions implies the non-uniqueness of five-dimensional black holes, and can be\nregarded as a sort of hair, even if it makes a rather thin wig.\nA string can naturally couple to a two-form potential B\u03bc\u03bd , and be an electric source for it, a\nfamiliar example being the fundamental string. Alternatively, its electric-magnetic dual in five\ndimensions would be a string magnetically charged under a one-form potential A\u03bc . Take one\nsuch string and bend it into circular shape, balancing it again by appropriately spinning the\nring. This configuration will have a non-trivial gauge field, but now the net charge will be zero.\nActually, as we shall ellaborate shortly, it is appropriate to view it as a dipole, with zero net\ncharge but with a non-vanishing local distribution of charge. So we may refer to the rotating\ncircular strings as rotating dipole rings. These were conjectured to exist in ref. [3, 4, 5], and\nthey are the subject of this paper.\nThe dipole field allows black rings to sport much thicker hair, and indeed it realizes a more\ndrastic infinite non-uniqueness: the only conserved asymptotic charges of these rings are their\nmass and spin, but they support a gauge field labeled by parameters within a continuous range\nof values. This possibility was first anticipated in [4], and it will be realized below.\nSince these solutions appear quite naturally in the supergravity description of string/Mtheory at low energies, they give us a new perspective on the role of black rings within string\ntheory, in a guise different from the one studied in [5]. We begin to explore it in this paper, and\nin particular provide the first precise microscopic calculation of the entropy of a black ring.\n\n1\n\n\fThe structure of the paper is the following: Since the study of the solutions is somewhat\ntechnical, before plunging into the details we introduce, in the next section, the basic concepts\nand describe, in a graphical manner, the main features of dipole rings. In section 3, after a\nshort description of the neutral rotating ring, we give the explicit form of the dipole solutions\nand compute their properties. In section 4 we address the issues raised by the solution that\ndescribes a rotating loop of fundamental string, and discuss qualitatively some features of dipole\nrings from a microscopic string viewpoint. In section 5 we explain how black rings appear in\ntriple intersections of branes, with the rotation arising from momentum running along the\nintersection. We also reproduce the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the extremal black ring,\nto next-to-leading order at large radius, via a statistical-mechanical counting of string states.\nWe conclude in section 6 with a discussion of the results and some qualitative considerations\ntowards a broader microscopic view of black rings. The appendix shows how the Myers-Perry\n(MP) black hole [2] is recovered from the solutions in section 3.\n\n2\n\nSetup and summary of properties\n\nWe construct dipole ring solutions for a number of theories, the simplest of which are the\nfive-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theories\n1\nI=\n16\u03c0G\n\nZ\n\n\u0013\n\u221a \u0012\n1 \u2212\u03b1\u03c6 2\n1\n2\nd x \u2212g R \u2212 (\u2202\u03c6) \u2212 e F .\n2\n4\n5\n\n(2.1)\n\nThe conventional Einstein-Maxwell theory is recovered when the dilaton decouples, i.e., \u03b1 = 0.\nOne often considers the addition of a Chern-Simons term to this theory, as required by minimal\nsupergravity in five dimensions. It turns out that the Chern-Simons term is of no consequence\nto the solutions in this paper, and therefore the dipole rings with \u03b1 = 0 are also solutions of\nminimal five-dimensional supergravity. Then the uniqueness theorem of supersymmetric black\nholes in this theory [4] directly implies that none of the black rings of the non-dilatonic theory\ncan be a supersymmetric solution.\nA ring is a circular string, and in the five-dimensional theories of (2.1), strings act as line\nsources of a magnetic field, i.e., they can be thought of as linear distributions of magnetic\nmonopoles. So the field of a magnetic black ring, outside the horizon, can be described as\nbeing produced by a circular configuration of magnetic monopoles. It is important to realize\nthat, even if there is a local distribution of charge, the total magnetic charge is zero [7]. The\nreason is that, in order to compute the magnetic charge in five dimensions, one has to specify\na two-sphere that encloses a point of the string, and a vector tangent to the string. Since this\n2\n\n\fvector changes orientation halfway around the ring, the total charge on the ring is zero. This\ncan also be seen as the fact that on a 4D slice that cuts the ring at diametrically opposite\npoints, one finds opposite magnetic charges. So the ring is analogous to a dipole.\nWe will also consider the electric dual of these solutions. The transformation\nH = e\u2212\u03b1\u03c6 \u2217 F ,\n\n\u03c6\u0303 = \u2212\u03c6,\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere H = dB is a three-form field strength, maps the theory (2.1) to\nI=\n\n1\n16\u03c0G\n\nZ\n\n\u0013\n\u221a \u0012\n1\n1\nd5 x \u2212g R \u2212 (\u2202 \u03c6\u0303)2 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b1\u03c6\u0303 H 2 .\n2\n12\n\n(2.3)\n\nIt will be convenient to express the dilaton coupling as\n\u03b12 =\n\n4\n4\n\u2212 ,\nN\n3\n\n0 < N \u2264 3,\n\n(2.4)\n\nsince the values N = 1, 2, 3 are of particular relevance to string and M-theory. In these cases the\nsolution can be regarded as an N-fold intersection of branes, which typically wrap an internal\nspace (see e.g., [6]). N = 3 yields the non-dilatonic theory, but another case of particular\ninterest is N = 1, since then the action (2.3) can be interpreted as the NS sector of low energy\nstring theory (in Einstein frame), and it contains the fundamental string as a solution.\nThe\n\u221a2\nq\n(s)\ndilaton \u03c3 of string theory is in this case \u03c3 = 38 \u03c6\u0303 and the string metric g\u03bc\u03bd\n= e 3 \u03c6\u0303 g\u03bc\u03bd . Via\n\ndualities the solution is related as well to other single-brane configurations.\nOne can define a \"local charge\" for the string solutions of (2.3) as1\nQ=\n\n1\n4\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nS2\n\ne\u2212\u03b1\u03c6\u0303 \u2217 H ,\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhere the S 2 encloses a point along the string, and give it a sign according to a choice of\norientation along the string. To see the meaning of this charge, consider first the case of a\nstraight fundamental string. This is infinitely long, but it can be made finite by requiring the\nspatial direction parallel to the string to form a compact circle. The string has a topological\nwinding number that is proportional to the local charge (2.5),\nn=\n\n\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\nQ,\n2G\n\n(2.6)\n\nand this is a conserved quantity2 that measures the number of times that the string goes around\nthe circle before closing in on itself, or alternatively the number of closed strings singly-wound\n1\n\nLocal, in the sense of corresponding to a localized source of the gauge field, which may not give rise to a\nnet charge, but not referring to the local (as opposed to global) character of the gauge symmetry.\n2\nUpon Kaluza-Klein reduction along the compact circle, Q is a conserved charge under the gauge field\n\nobtained from reduction of the two-form potential.\n\n3\n\n\fon the circle. In general, the winding n \u221d Q can also be defined, with a different proportionality\n\nfactor, for dual brane realizations of the N = 1 solution, while for N = 2, 3 obtained from brane\n\nintersections, the winding of the \"effective string\" at the intersection is proportional to QN .\nConsider now a circular string loop in asymptotically flat spacetime (no compact circle). We\n\nS2\n\nFigure 1: The non-topological winding number n of the ring is proportional to the local charge Q\nmeasured from the electric flux of H across an S 2 that encloses a section of the string. An azimuthal\n\nangle has been suppressed in the picture, so the S 2 is represented as a circle.\n\ncan also regard it as a closed string, but now it does not wrap any topologically non-trivial\ncycle. Instead, it winds around a contractible circle, but we can still define the local charge Q\n\n(2.5) (see fig. 1), and n as in (2.6). Now n is not topological, but it still measures the number of\nwindings of the string around the circle. So even in the case where the charge is not a conserved\nquantity, it has a clear physical meaning and it provides the most natural characterization of\nthe source of the dipole field.\nDipole rings are therefore specified by the three physical parameters (M, J, Q). The third\n\nparameter, which is independent of the other two, is not a conserved charge, and is classically\na continuous parameter. So, as we will see in detail, it implies infinite non-uniqueness in five\n\ndimensions. Upon quantization in string theory these parameters become discrete, and there\nwill be a finite but still very large number of states with the same mass and spin.\nWe are now ready to summarize the features of the dipole rings that follow from the detailed\nanalysis of the next section. We can adequately fix the overall scale of the solutions by fixing\ntheir mass M. Then the solutions are characterized by reduced dimensionless magnitudes,\nobtained by dividing out an appropriate power of M, or of GM (which has dimension (length)2 ),\ne.g., we define a dimensionless \"reduced spin\" variable j, conveniently normalized as\nj2 \u2261\n\n27\u03c0 J 2\n,\n32G M 3\n\n4\n\n(2.7)\n\n\f(j 2 is often a more convenient variable than j), as well as a reduced area of the horizon,\n3\naH \u2261\n16\n\ns\n\n3 AH\n,\n\u03c0 (GM)3/2\n\n(2.8)\n\nand a reduced local charge,\n\nQ\n.\n(2.9)\nGM\nThe properties of the neutral solutions (q = 0) found in [1] are summarized in the plot of\nq\u2261\u221a\n\naH vs j 2 in figure 2. The explicit analytical form of the curves is given below in (3.8), (3.9).\nThe non-uniqueness in 27/32 \u2264 j 2 < 1 is clear from the figure. Note we have normalized aH so\n\nthat its maximum value for a neutral ring is 1.\n\u221a\n2 2\nblack hole\n\naH\n1\n\nlarge black ring\nsmall black ring\n\n0\n\n27\n32\n\n1\n\nj2\n\nFigure 2: Plot of horizon area vs (spin)2 , for given mass, for the neutral rotating black ring (solid)\nand black hole (dotted). The reduced variables j 2 and aH are defined in (2.7), (2.8). There are\ntwo branches of black rings, which branch off from the cusp at (j 2 , aH ) = (27/32, 1), and which are\ndubbed \"large\" and \"small\" according to their area. For spins in the range 27/32 \u2264 j 2 < 1 the black\n\nrings in the two branches coexist with a black hole of the same mass and spin, implying three-fold\n\nnon-uniqueness. Other interesting features are: The black hole at j 2 = 27/32, i.e., with the same mass\n\u221a\nand spin as the minimally spinning ring, has aH = 5/2. At j 2 = aH 2 = 8/9 the curves intersect and\nwe find a black hole and a (large) black ring both with the same mass, spin and area. The limiting\nsolution at (j 2 , aH ) = (1, 0) is a naked singularity. Fastly spinning black rings, j 2 \u2192 \u221e, become\n\u221a\nthinner and their area decreases as aH \u223c 1/(j 2).\n\nFor the dipole-charged solutions we focus on the values of the dilaton coupling most relevant\nto string theory, namely N = 1, 2, 3 in (2.4). The space of solutions is a two-dimensional surface\n5\n\n\fin the space (j, q, aH ). Rather than a 3D plot of this surface, a clearer representation is obtained\nplotting several sections of it at constant q as curves in the plane (j 2 , aH ). These are depicted in\nfig. 3. It becomes apparent that if we fix the mass and the angular momentum, with j 2 > 27/32,\n1\n\nN =1\n\nN =2\n\nq\n\n\u2711\n\u2711\n\u2730\n\u2711\n\n0\n27\n32\n\n1\n\n27\n32\n\n.95 1\n\n1\n\nN =3\n\naH\n.37\n\n0\n27\n32\n\n.93\n\n1\n\nj2\n\nFigure 3: aH vs j 2 , for different values of q, for dipole rings with dilaton coupling \u03b1 = 2 2/3, 2/3, 0\np\n\np\n\n(N = 1, 2, 3). q varies continuously, but we have plotted the curves for only a few representative values,\nwith q increasing in the direction of the arrow: shorter dashing corresponds to larger q, and the solid\ncurves correspond to the neutral ring (q = 0). For any fixed j, i.e., fixed mass and spin, such that\nj 2 > 27/32, there are always rings with q in a continuous range of values, implying continuous nonuniqueness. Observe also that for fixed q 6= 0, j is bounded above and below so the range of allowed\n\nspins is finite, and becomes narrower as q grows. When q reaches its maximum value the curves\n\ndegenerate to a point, which is at (j 2 , aH ) = (1, 0), (.95, 0), (.93, .37) for N = 1, 2, 3 resp. (see fig. 5\nfor the maximum values of q). For N = 3, the endpoints of the curves lie on the thick grey line, which\ncorresponds to extremal dipole rings of finite horizon area.\n\n6\n\n\fthere exist black ring solutions with q taking values over a continuous finite interval3 . Black\nhole uniqueness is then violated by a continuous parameter, and therefore in an infinite manner.\nThere are other features common to all values of N. Like in the neutral case, for fixed\nq there are two branches of black rings, one of them having larger area than the other, and\nin the range where they coexist we find two black rings with the same mass, spin and local\ncharge. The two branches join at the slowest spinning ring with the given q, and this ring\nalways has larger spin and smaller area than the minimally spinning neutral ring. The smaller\narea is easy to understand if we recall that adding charge to a black hole while keeping its\nmass fixed typically reduces its area. The larger spin is needed in order to counterbalance the\nattraction between diametrically opposite sections of the ring, which as we saw can be regarded\nas oppositely charged.\nIn contrast to the neutral case, where the spin of large rings is unbounded, the spin of large\ndipole rings has an upper bound. The solutions which saturate the bound are extremal (but\nnon-supersymmetric) rings, meaning that the outer and inner horizons come to coincide. A\nqualitative explanation for this upper bound will be provided in section 4. Of these extremal\nsolutions, the only ones that have non-zero area are the non-dilatonic extremal rings, i.e.,\nN = 3. This was expected, since the extremal limit of the straight strings in five dimensions\nresults in non-zero area only when N = 3. For N > 1 the small ring branch also has an\nextremal limit, which corresponds to maximum j in that branch, and which have non-zero area\nonly if N = 3. In the N = 3 plot in fig. 3 we draw the area of the extremal solutions as a thick\ngrey line, but one should bear in mind that q is not constant along this curve, i.e., the relation\nbetween Q and M at extremality is not fixed but changes with J. For N = 1 the branch of\nsmall rings terminates at a singular solution before the extremal limit is reached.\n\nIn section 5 we exhibit rotating dipole ring solutions of string and M-theory at low energies,\nthat arise from the intersection of three kinds of branes with different dipole charges, e.g.,\nD2, D6 and NS5 brane charges, and which reduce to the cases N = 1, 2, 3 above by having\nequal numbers of one, two, or three of the component branes, and no branes of the remaining\ncomponents. Their features are qualitatively the same as described above, according to the\nnumber of component branes that are present.\nAs we will see, many of the qualitative properties of large rings are similar to those of\ntheir straight string limits. Since we often have a microscopic stringy picture of the latter, this\nallows us to get at least a qualitative microscopic picture of large rings, and understand some\n3\n\nFor generic dilaton coupling, the range of q is finite for 1 \u2264 N \u2264 3, and infinite for 0 < N < 1, although\nthese figures do not reflect it.\n\n7\n\n\fof the features described above, as we will explain in sections 4 and 5. The small ring branch\nis more intriguing, but we will be able to make some reasonable suggestions about its meaning\nin section 6.\nWe finish this section mentioning how earlier ring solutions are related to the ones in this\npaper. The first example in this class that we are aware of is the construction of a self-gravitating\nstatic loop of string described in [7]. This is a static, extremal dipole ring with dilaton coupling\nN = 1. It does not have a regular horizon, and in the absence of rotation or any external\nfield, it contains a conical singularity disk. Ref. [3] generalized it to static extremal dipole rings\nwith arbitrary dilaton coupling \u03b1, and also to static extremal rings from triple intersections of\nbranes. All these solutions are recovered (in different coordinates) from the solutions in this\npaper by setting the rotation to zero and taking the extremal limit. When N = 3 they have a\nregular degenerate horizon, but they still contain conical singularities (if no fluxbrane is added).\nRefs. [8, 5] constructed charged black rings, but these have a net charge (besides dipole charges,\nnot independent of the net charges), and are therefore different from the ones in this paper.\nWe turn now to the explicit form of the solutions, and to explain how the features we have\ndescribed are obtained.\n\n3\n\nDipole black ring solutions\n\nThe neutral rotating black ring was obtained in [1] from the Kaluza-Klein C-metric solutions\nin [9] via a double Wick rotation of coordinates and analytic continuation of parameters. All\nthe new solutions in this paper are similarly obtained from the generalized C-metrics found\nin [10]. It turns out that the coordinates and parameters in which these new black rings are\nexpressed more simply are slightly different from those previously used for black rings in [1, 5],\nso we need to begin with a brief description of the neutral solution in these new coordinates.\nThey share the feature with the coordinates in [11, 5] that the cubic functions involved take\na factorized form and allow for easier analytic evaluation than in the original form in ref. [1].\nThis allows us to provide some new analytical results.\n\n3.1\n\nNeutral ring\n\nThe metric is\nds\n\n2\n\n1+y\nF (y)\ndt + C(\u03bd, \u03bb) R\nd\u03c8\n= \u2212\nF (x)\nF (y)\n8\n\n!2\n\n\fG(y) 2\ndy 2\ndx2\nG(x) 2\nR2\nF (x) \u2212\nd\u03c8 \u2212\n+\n+\nd\u03c6 ,\n+\n2\n(x \u2212 y)\nF (y)\nG(y) G(x) F (x)\n#\n\n\"\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere4\nG(\u03be) = (1 \u2212 \u03be 2 )(1 + \u03bd\u03be) ,\n\nF (\u03be) = 1 + \u03bb\u03be,\nand\nC(\u03bd, \u03bb) =\n\ns\n\n\u03bb(\u03bb \u2212 \u03bd)\n\nThe coordinates x and y vary within the ranges\n\u22121 \u2264 x \u2264 1,\n\n1+\u03bb\n.\n1\u2212\u03bb\n\n\u2212\u221e < y \u2264 \u22121 ,\n\n(3.2)\n\n(3.3)\n\n(3.4)\n\nand the dimensionless parameters \u03bb and \u03bd within\n0 < \u03bd \u2264 \u03bb < 1.\n\n(3.5)\n\nR has dimensions of length, and for thin large rings it corresponds roughly to the radius of\nthe ring circle [5]. In order to avoid conical singularities at y = \u22121 and x = \u22121 the angular\n\nvariables must be identified with periodicity\n\n\u2206\u03c8 = \u2206\u03c6 = 2\u03c0\n\n\u221a\n\n1\u2212\u03bb\n.\n1\u2212\u03bd\n\n(3.6)\n\nTo avoid also a conical singularity at x = +1 we take the two parameters \u03bb, \u03bd, to be related as\n\u03bb=\n\n2\u03bd\n.\n1 + \u03bd2\n\n(3.7)\n\nWith these choices, the solution has a regular horizon of topology S 1 \u00d7 S 2 at y = \u22121/\u03bd, an\nergosurface of the same topology at y = \u22121/\u03bb, and an inner spacelike singularity at y = \u2212\u221e.\n\nAsymptotic spatial infinity is reached as x \u2192 y \u2192 \u22121. The coordinate system is illustrated in\nfig. 4.\n\nA static ring solution, which necessarily contains a conical singularity, is obtained when\ninstead of (3.7) we set \u03bb = \u03bd [12]. The spherical black hole of Myers and Perry with rotation in\na single plane can also be obtained from (3.1), but in the coordinates in (3.1) this case is much\nsubtler than when using the forms of the metric employed in [1, 5]. The appropriate limiting\nprocedure is described in the appendix. When \u03bd \u2192 1 the solution becomes singular and the\n\nhorizon is replaced by a naked singularity.\n4\n\nWe warn the reader that even if we use the same letters x, y, \u03bb, \u03bd, F, G as in [5], their meaning here is slightly\ndifferent.\n\n9\n\n\f\u03c8\n\ny\n\nx\n\ny = \u22121/\u03bd\n\nx = \u22121\n\nx = +1\n\ny = \u22121\nx = const\n\nFigure 4: Coordinate system for black ring metrics (adapted from [12]). The diagram sketches a\nsection at constant t and \u03c6. Surfaces of constant y are ring-shaped, while x is a polar coordinate on\nthe S 2 (roughly x \u223c cos \u03b8). x = \u00b11 and y = \u22121 are fixed-point sets (i.e., axes) of \u2202\u03c6 and \u2202\u03c8 , resp.\n\nInfinity lies at x = y = \u22121.\n\nThe mass, spin, and other physical parameters of the neutral black ring can be readily\nrecovered as the neutral limit \u03bc \u2192 0 of the expressions for the dipole ring, eqs. (3.23)-(3.27)\n\nbelow, so we will not present them here. Note that for a black ring at equilibrium, i.e., satisfying\n\n(3.6) and (3.7), there is only one independent dimensionless parameter, so the reduced area\nand spin, (2.7), (2.8), must be related. aH and j can be computed from the expressions for M,\nJ and AH , and the analytic relation between them is, in parametric form,\nq\n\naH = 2 \u03bd(1 \u2212 \u03bd) ,\n\nj2 =\n\n(1 + \u03bd)3\n8\u03bd\n\n(black ring) ,\n\n(3.8)\n\nwith 0 < \u03bd \u2264 1.

(3.10) allows to find an approximate meaning for them, which becomes more accurate for\nthin rings. For large but finite R, the parameter \u03bd \u2243 r0 /R measures the ratio between the\nradius of the S 2 at the horizon and the radius of the ring. So smaller values of \u03bd correspond\nto thinner rings. Also, \u03bb/\u03bd is a measure of the speed of rotation of the ring.

These are nakedly\n\nsingular solutions. Only in the non-dilatonic case N = 3 does the area remain finite as \u03bd \u2192 0,\n\nand the solution has a regular degenerate horizon. The mass M and local charge Q are not\n\nany simply related in the extremal limit, and for finite values of R, the extremal solutions are\nnot supersymmetric.\nThe main properties of dipole rings are summarized in fig. 3. In order to produce these\nplots, we first solve eq. (3.22) for \u03bb as a function of \u03bd and \u03bc. Using (3.23)-(3.28), we compute\nthe reduced local charge q, spin j, and area aH , as functions of \u03bc and \u03bd, and then we invert to\nfind \u03bc as a function of q and \u03bd. The inverted function can be seen to involve more than one\nbranch for N > 1. All of this can be done fully analitically for N = 1, 2, 3, but the expressions\nare exceedingly long and only simplify in the extremal limit. So we proceed using a symbolic\nmanipulation computer program. Eventually we obtain aH and j 2 as functions of \u03bd and q,\nwhich allows us to plot the curves for fixed q, varying 0 \u2264 \u03bd \u2264 1.

When N = 3 and \u03b3 = \u03c3,\nthe reduction along w to four dimensions yields the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole.\nWhile the straight string (3.34) solves the field equations for arbitrary values of \u03c3 and \u03b3,\nthe strings that are obtained as a limit of rings that satisfy the equilibrium condition (3.22)\nmust, from this condition, be such that\nsinh2 \u03c3 = 1 + N sinh2 \u03b3 .\n\n(3.38)\n\nNote that when \u03b3 6= 0 the boost has to be larger than in the neutral case \u03b3 = 0. This is easily\n\ninterpreted: sections of the ring at diametrically opposite ends, \u03c8 and \u03c8 + \u03c0, have opposite\norientation and therefore they attract each other via the H\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 field. Then a larger centrifugal\n\nrepulsion is needed in order to achieve equilibrium, and the effect persists even at very large\nring radii.\nThe ADM stress-energy tensor of the string (3.34) is\nr0\n(1 + cosh2 \u03c3 + N sinh2 \u03b3) ,\n4G \u0010\n\u0011\nr0\n=\nsinh2 \u03c3 \u2212 1 \u2212 N sinh2 \u03b3 ,\n4G\nr0\nsinh \u03c3 cosh \u03c3 .\n=\n4G\n\nTtt =\nTww\nTtw\n\n(3.39)\n\nWe observe that, as was the case for the neutral ring and the charged rings of [5], the pressure\nTww of the limiting string vanishes when the equilibrium condition (3.38) is enforced. The\nrestrictions on the parameters of the strings that result as a limit of balanced rings, such as\neq. (3.38), are in general poorly understood (see also [5]), and although it is clear that they\nare the result of an equilibrium of forces, it would be interesting to understand them in more\ndetail.

For the dilatonic solutions the horizon turns into a null singularity, whereas the nondilatonic extremal ring has a regular degenerate horizon. Typically, the extremal limit yields\nsolutions where the spin and/or the charge reach a maximum value. In the present case, if we\nfix the mass and the spin, with j 2 > 1, then there is always a maximum value of Q which is\nsaturated precisely in the extremal limit \u03bd \u2192 0. For 27/32 < j 2 < 1 the situation is more\n\ncomplicated and depends on the dilaton coupling, as can be seen in fig. 3. On the other hand,\n\nif we fix the local charge and the mass, i.e., fix q, the spin reaches an absolute maximum at an\nextremal solution along the large ring branch. There is also a local maximum along the small\nring branch, but this solution is extremal only for N > 1. For N = 1 this local maximum is\nnot an extremal solution. In this case the branch of small black rings with q < qmax =\n2\n\n2\n\nq\n\n2/3\u03c0\n\nterminates at \u03bd = [1 \u2212 (q/qmax ) ]/[1 + (q/qmax ) ], i.e., before \u03bd = 0, so these should not be\n\ninterpreted as extremal solutions, except when q \u2192 qmax .\n\nIn the extremal limit the physical variables admit simple enough expressions in terms of\n\nthe only dimensionless parameter that remains after imposing the equilibrium condition (3.22),\nand which we take to be \u03bc.

Observe the existence of a maximum value of q in all three cases\n(it is also possible to see that if N < 1 there is no such upper bound). We will interpret this\nfeature from a microscopic viewpoint in the next section. For N = 2, 3, when q is below this\nmaximum value there exist two extremal ring solutions with the same mass and dipole charge,\nbut different spin. These two rings are the extremal limits of solutions in the large and small\n6\n\nExact expressions for general N can be found, but they are fairly long.\n\n16\n\n\fN =3\n\nj2\n\nN =2\n\nN =1\n\n1\n.95\n.93\n0\n\n.21\n\n.26\n\nq\n\nq\n\n2\n3\u03c0\n\nFigure 5: (Spin)2 vs local charge, for extremal rings of fixed mass.

Note the absence of a second N = 1 extremal solution,\nfor fixed q, in fig. 5.\nIn [3] it was observed that when the N = 3 extremal static ring is balanced by a fluxbrane of\nappropriate strength, then the geometry near the horizon of the ring becomes exactly AdS3 \u00d7S 2 .\n\nRef. [5] conjectured that this might be the case as well when the ring is balanced not by a\n\nfluxbrane but by rotation, as in the present paper. However, closer examination reveals that\nthis is not the case: for any finite value of R the near-horizon extremal geometry is distorted\naway from AdS3 \u00d7 S 2 by factors of the polar angle of the S 2 .\n\n4\n\nLoop of fundamental string, and qualitative microscopics\n\nThe extremal ring solution is particularly simple when N = 1. Since the local charge in this\ncase can be regarded as fundamental string charge, it is expected to describe a rotating loop\nof fundamental string. However, this appears to raise a puzzle, since it is well known that in\nperturbative string theory it is impossible to have a closed string loop that rotates like a rigid\nwheel. The resolution is fairly simple, and can be understood more simply if we focus first on\nthe similar situation posed by a straight string that carries linear momentum.\n17\n\n\fRefs. [13, 14] constructed solutions of low energy string theory with non-zero winding and\nmomentum of the form\n1\nds2 = \u2212 du dv \u2212 (h\u22121 \u2212 1)|\u1e1e|2 dv 2 + 2(h\u22121 \u2212 1)\u1e1e * dx dv + dx * dx\nh\n\n(4.44)\n\nwhere u, v are light-cone coordinates, F(v) parametrizes a curve in the d\u22122 transverse directions\nx, and h is a harmonic function\nh=1+\n\nQ\n|x \u2212 F|d\u22124\n\n(4.45)\n\n(we will not need the dilaton and H field for our argument) so the solution is singular at\nx = F(v). Q is proportional to the winding number of the string. It was shown in [14] that one\ncan match these solutions to a fundamental string source, with a profile of momentum-carrying\ntransverse oscillations given by F(v).\nNow consider fundamental strings with small oscillation amplitudes, such that when we\nperform a coarse-grain average over their oscillation profiles we get hFi \u2243 0 and h\u1e1e * xi \u2243 0,\nbut h|\u1e1e|2 i =\n6 0. We shall not be too precise about how this averaging is performed, but one can\n\nsuppose, along the lines of [15], that we choose not to resolve distances smaller than a typical\namplitude, so we remain at |x| \u226b |F|. The coarse-grained metric is then approximated by\np\n1\nds2 = \u2212 du dv + d\u22124 dv 2 + dx * dx\nh\n|x| h\n\n(4.46)\n\nwith h = 1 + Q/|x|d\u22124 and p = Qh|\u1e1e|2 i, i.e., we can regard the strings as oscillating about\na center-of-mass line at x = 0, and carrying a large, macroscopic total momentum density\n\nQh|\u1e1e|2 i.\n\nSo, after averaging over strings with small oscillations, the effective solution (4.46) looks\n\nlike a string with a longitudinal momentum wave. Since it is well known that relativistic\nfundamental strings cannot support longitudinal oscillations, the proper interpretation of (4.46)\nmust be in terms of this averaging procedure. This interpretation is, for the purposes of this\npaper, basically the same as the microscopic proposal for the two- and three-charge black hole\nsolutions in [15, 16, 17]. Following [16, 17], we may refer to (4.46) as the \"naive\" solution for a\nstring carrying momentum, which is a coarse-grained average over the structure near the core\nof the \"correct\" metrics (4.44).\nThe extremal rings of this paper are now seen to be \"naive\" metrics, as (4.46). Indeed, the\nlimit of infinite radius (3.34) for the N = 1 extremal solutions is precisely the metric (4.46)\nin d = 5 with Q = Q. So the rotating loop of string is an effective coarse-grained description\n\nof strings which oscillate about the ring, with amplitude much smaller than the ring radius,\n18\n\n\fand the rotation is provided by the momentum circulating along the ring carried by these\noscillations. One would also expect the existence of \"correct\" ring solutions, analogous to\n(4.44), where the momentum wave is resolved into transverse oscillations of the string, but due\nto the absence of supersymmetry it appears difficult to find these solutions analytically7 . It\nwould also be interesting to construct the rotating loops of string, with oscillations, as classical\nsolutions of perturbative string theory.\nThis picture allows us to get a qualitative microscopic understanding of some features of\nextremal dipole rings. Our main assumptions are that (a) extremal solutions correspond to\nstrings with chiral oscillations, i.e., only left-movers (or only right-movers), and (b) that Q\n\ngives, through eq. (2.6), the number n of strings wound in the loop (or alternatively, the\nnumber of windings of a single string n times longer). Then we can see that there must be an\nupper bound on the spin for fixed Q and M, which is saturated in the extremal limit. For, if we\n\nfix n and the total energy M, then we are restricting the total energy that can be carried by the\noscillations. If this energy is distributed among only left-movers, i.e., an extremal state, then\nthe angular momentum will be maximized. Solutions with both left and right movers will be\nnon-extremal, and have lower angular momentum. This is indeed the behavior that we observe\nin the ring solutions.\n\nWe can also understand qualitatively why q must be bounded above, i.e., why there is a\nmaximum Q for fixed M.8 The total energy of the configuration, M, must be distributed among\nthe tension of wound strings, and among the momentum carried by oscillations. So there will\n\nbe a maximum number of strings that can make a ring (and a similar story goes for a single\nlong string that winds n times around the loop). The energy that goes into each string in the\nloop is roughly the product of the string tension times the length of the loop, so we would\nexpect to maximize the number of strings by decreasing the radius. But a ring rotating at a\nsmaller radius must be rotating faster in order to be balanced, and therefore more energy has to\nbe spent into momentum carriers. So a compromise must be reached between momentum and\nwinding, i.e., between j and q. It is then fairly clear that, among extremal rings, the solution\nwith maximum q will also be the one with minimum j, and again this is observed in fig. 5. It\nis less clear, and this requires a better understanding of the balance of forces in rings, why the\nequilibrium condition (3.22) for the fundamental string loop, \u03bb = \u03bc, corresponds, at large radii,\nto having equal winding and momentum numbers, i.e., self-T-dual strings.\n7\n\nThe resolution of donut-shaped configurations in [15] is different, since those carry a net charge, like super-\n\ntubes.\n8\nThis is non-trivial: for dilaton coupling N < 1 there is no such a maximum, suggesting that these cases\nmay not have a microscopic stringy interpretation.\n\n19\n\n\fIn section 6 we will take these arguments further to try to understand the qualitative\nproperties of black rings far from extremality, even neutral rings.\nThe degeneracy of states of a string with chiral momentum can be reproduced in the supergravity context by assigning a stretched horizon to (4.46) with entropy proportional to its area\n[18] (see also [15]). One may try to extend this picture to the extremal N = 1 ring, including\nthe corrections for large but finite radius. However, a more stringent test of the correspondence\nbetween area and entropy of string states is provided by extremal rings with non-zero area, and\nthese will be analyzed in the next section.\n\n5\n\nRings from brane intersections, and quantitative microscopics\n\nThe C-metric solutions of ref. [10] can also be used to obtain, via appropriate analytic continuations, black rings with dipoles under several gauge fields. These are naturally interpreted in\nstring theory as arising from intersections of branes. The rotating ring solution with three local\ncharges is particularly interesting. It can be regarded as the result of bending into a circular\nring-shape a three-charge five-dimensional black string with a momentum wave. The three\ncharges can be interpreted as e.g., charges of D6, D2 and NS5 branes intersecting along the\nstring, and the momentum runs along the intersection. In another realization the ring results\nfrom the intersection of three M5 branes [19]. Since they are in any case related by dualities,\nwe will provide explicit results only for the more symmetric M5\u22a5M5\u22a5M5 configuration.\n\n5.1\n\nSupergravity solution\n\nThe solution contains three new parameters \u03bci , i = 1, 2, 3, in addition to \u03bb and \u03bd, and which\nare associated with each of the three M5 branes.

The intersection of the branes can be regarded as an \"effective\nstring\", capable of supporting left and right moving excitations, analogously to a fundamental\nstring, but with an effective length n1 n2 n3 times longer than the circle length, so the excitation\ngap is correspondingly smaller. The qualitative microscopic arguments described at the end of\nsection 4 therefore apply here as well, but we can also perform a more quantitative analysis\nand count the string states using statistical mechanics. We will reproduce in this way the\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy of the black ring including the leading corrections that come from\nconsidering rings at large but finite radius. The calculation shares many features with the study\nof the extremal string-antistring system in [21].\nWe do the analysis only for the extremal ring, and leave the discussion of non-extremal\nrings for future work. We shall work at large radius, expanding in the small parameters \u03bb, \u03bci ,\nand keeping the first order corrections in \u03bb \u223c \u03bci \u223c 1/R. The equilibrium condition (3.22) is\n\u03bb=\n\nX\n\n\u03bci + O(\u03bb3) ,\n\ni\n\nand will be imposed in the following.\n22\n\n(5.17)\n\n\fThe extremal system is regarded as the ground state of the ring with finite radius, with\nchiral momentum excitations at level np on a CFT with central charge c = 6n1 n2 n3 , or, in the\nlong string picture, a c = 6 CFT but now at level n1 n2 n3 np . Either way the degeneracy of the\nmicroscopic state is\n\n\u221a\nSmicro = 2\u03c0 np n1 n2 n3 .\n\n(5.18)\n\nThis must be compared to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the ring. To this effect, we have\nalready identified the number of branes forming the ring, ni , in eq. (5.16). To obtain np we want\nto use a definition that captures the momentum that runs along the ring in a manner similar to\nthe way that the brane numbers ni characterize the winding along the ring. Observe that the\nbrane numbers ni are defined through an integral over a surface that encloses a section of the\nring, and the result is independent of the specific geometry or location of the surface as long as\nit encloses the ring as in fig. 1. A similarly covariant definition can be given for the momentum\nnumber np in terms of a Komar integral, analogous to those studied in [22]. Namely, if \u03b7 is\nthe one-form dual to the Killing vector \u2202\u03c8\u0303 that generates translations along the ring, with \u03c8\u0303\ncanonically normalized to have periodicity 2\u03c0, i.e., \u03b7 =\nnp =\n\n\u2206\u03c8\ng dx\u03bc ,\n2\u03c0 \u03c8\u03bc\n\n1 Z\n\u2217d\u03b7 ,\n16\u03c0G S 1 \u00d7S 2\n\nthen we identify\n(5.19)\n\nwhere the surface S 1 \u00d7 S 2 encloses the entire ring and can be taken to lie at constant y \u2208\n(\u22121/\u03bd, \u22121) and constant t. Since \u2217d\u03b7 is regular (i.e., vanishes) at the axis y = \u22121, the\n\nintegration over S 1 \u00d7 S 2 in (5.19) can be extended to an integration over an S 3 that encloses\nthe ring completely. This is then the same as the Komar integral for the angular momentum\n\ncontained inside the S 3 . For these solutions the gauge fields do not contribute to this angular\nmomentum, so its value is independent of the location of the integration surface, as long as it\nencloses the ring, and so the S 3 can be taken at asymptotic infinity. Then (5.19) must be equal\nto the ADM value of the angular momentum, i.e.,\nnp = J ,\n\n(5.20)\n\nwith J given in (5.9).\nThis result is valid for general non-extremal rings. If we take the extremal limit \u03bd = 0 and\nexpand for large radius,\n\n\u0011\n\u03c0R3 \u0010\n\u03bb 1 + 2\u03bb + O(\u03bb2 ) .\nnp =\n2G\nIn this same limit the brane numbers (5.16) are\n\nni =\n\n\u0012\n\n2\u03c0\nG\n\n\u00131/3\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nR\u03bci 1 + O(\u03bb2) .\n23\n\n(5.21)\n\n(5.22)\n\n\fWe have used (5.17) to simplify the terms in brackets in these expressions. The BekensteinHawking entropy of the extremal ring is, from (5.10),\nSBH =\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n2\u03c0 2 R3 q\nAH\n=\n\u03bb\u03bc1 \u03bc2 \u03bc3 1 + \u03bb + O(\u03bb2 ) ,\n4G\nG\n\n(5.23)\n\nand comparing to the microscopic entropy (5.18), using (5.21) and (5.22), we find\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nSBH = Smicro 1 + O(\u03bb2 ) .\n\n(5.24)\n\nThe agreement between the leading terms is of course nothing but the result of [20] for a straight\nstring, but the corrections at first order in \u03bb, which are also reproduced correctly, are a genuine\nfeature of the black ring. Like in the string-antistring system in [21], obtaining agreement\nbeyond the leading correction appears to require further refinements, presumably because the\ndeparture from the supersymmetric state becomes too large.\nThe fact that we have reproduced the entropy using the same formula (5.18) as in the case of\na straight string does not mean that the bending of the string has no effect on the microscopic\nstates. The forces that are present (centrifugal and self-attraction of the ring) produce a shift in\nthe excitation levels, which is crucial in analyzing the excitations above extremality. However,\nthe degeneracy of the ground state is not affected by these shifts.\n\n6\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe have supplied the first example, to our knowledge, of black hole solutions that are asymptotically flat, with regular horizons, and which are the source of a dipolar gauge field. They\nalso imply the violation of uniqueness by a continuous parameter, for solutions of (2.1) and\n(2.3) with\n\u03c0J 2 > GM 3 .\n\n(6.1)\n\nThis is black hole hair of the most basic type -no \"secondary hair\", nor exotic fields- in the\nfamiliar Einstein-Maxwell theory. It is then clear that any notion of black hole uniqueness in\nthe most basic theories in higher dimensions can not be too simple. Following the discovery of\nthe neutral black ring, several steps have been taken towards this goal9 . Ref. [4] proved that the\nonly supersymmetric black hole of minimal five-dimensional supergravity is the BMPV solution\n[24]. This makes it very unlikely that supersymmetric black rings with a regular horizon exist at\nall in any five-dimensional supergravity theory. Refs. [25] have proven the uniqueness of static\n9\n\nRef. [23] makes some speculations in this direction.\n\n24\n\n\fblack holes. The stationary case is typically much more complicated, but recently it has been\nestablished that the MP solution is the unique black hole in five dimensions among the class of\nneutral solutions with spherical topology and with three commuting Killing vectors [26]. Since\nwe have not found any spherical black holes with a gauge dipole field (see the appendix), it\nseems likely that this result should extend as well to the theories (2.1), (2.3) studied in this\npaper. It is still unknown whether the solutions with only two commuting Killing symmetries\nconjectured in [4] actually exist, and if they do, whether they can be dipole sources as well.\nRef. [27] began a systematic study of stationary solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell theory in\nhigher dimensions. Other interesting solutions in this class have been found in [28], and a study\nof the electromagnetic properties of five-dimensional rotating black holes has been carried out\nin [29].\nThe existence of dipole black rings in five dimensions contrasts with the absence in four\ndimensions of asymptotically flat black holes, regular on and outside the horizon, with a gauge\ndipole and no monopole charge10 . To be sure, there do exist solutions that describe two static\nblack holes, with charges equal in magnitude but with opposite sign, and which therefore form\na dipole [30, 21]. But the two black holes attract each other, and if we tried to balance the\nattraction by spinning the configuration, radiation would be generated, losing stationarity.\nAlternatively, the dipole can be balanced, both in four and five dimensions, by immersing it in\na Melvin-like field, i.e., a fluxbrane, or with cosmic strings, but then asymptotic flatness is lost\n[30, 3].\nIt is interesting to compare the different string theory realizations of black rings, in this\npaper and in [5]. In ref. [5] the black ring results from a tubular intersection of D1-branes and\nD5-branes, properly viewed as a six-dimensional configuration. Reduction along the direction\nof the tube z results into a five-dimensional black ring with net D1 and D5 charges. The\neffective string extends along z, i.e., transversely to the ring, and the angular momentum is\nprovided by the intrinsic spin of the ground state, i.e., it is unrelated to the presence of any\nmomentum along the string. In the rings in this paper, the effective string lies instead along the\ndirection of the ring, and the angular momentum is actually the result of momentum carried\nby excitations moving along the circle. The extremal ground states, and the excitations above\nthem, are therefore quite different in each case. Also, the rings in [5] have supersymmetric\nlimits with finite radius (supertubes), whereas in the present paper supersymmetry can only\nbe preserved in the straight string limit. So black rings can appear in string theory from rather\ndifferent perspectives.\n10\n\nThe solutions with an electric dipole in [31] have singular horizons.\n\n25\n\n\fNevertheless, the microscopic picture for the neutral black ring suggested by the analysis in\n[5] nicely dovetails with the idea in this paper that a black ring can be viewed as a loop of string\nwith excitations running along the loop. In keeping with the string/black hole correspondence\nprinciple [32, 33], ref. [5] proposed that neutral black rings go over, as the string coupling is\ndecreased, into highly-excited fundamental strings in a fuzzy donut-shaped configuration. Now,\nif we start from a dipole ring with small winding n, and we add left and right moving excitations\nto the string loop, we will be moving further away from extremality (effectively decreasing q)\nand approaching a configuration more and more similar to the fuzzy string-donut proposed for\nthe neutral black ring. The latter would simply correspond to the case where there is no net\nwinding around the loop.\nPushing this picture further, we find an appealing explanation of the differences between\nthe large and small neutral ring branches (fig. 2). They would differ in the way the winding\ntotals to zero: rings in the small branch would contain some strings wound with opposite\norientation, whereas large rings would correspond to configurations where no string makes a\nfull wind. Amusingly, this simple idea can easily explain several peculiarities of these branches\nof solutions. The existence of a limit in the small ring branch, with maximum j and zero\narea, follows if this limiting configuration consists of oppositely oriented pairs of extremal\nstrings, with only, say, left-movers. The argument is similar to those given in section 4. In\nthis configuration the total energy M has to be distributed among the tension of wound strings\nand the momentum of oscillators. The presence of wound strings limits the radius of the ring,\nsince the winding energy grows with this radius. Then the angular momentum, which for given\namount of momentum along the ring also grows with the radius, will also be bounded above,\nand the bound saturated when the oscillators all move in the same sense \u2013 i.e., we have pairs of\noppositely wound extremal strings. The degeneracy of extremal fundamental strings is not large\nenough to register in the gravitating solution, and so this configuration appears as a zero-area\nsingularity. If we then add some right-movers the temperature raises, we enhance the entropy,\nand a finite horizon area appears, much like when a gravitating fundamental string becomes\nnon-extremal. This increase in aH should come with a decrease in j, due to the right-movers,\nand this is precisely what we observe in fig. 2 as we move along the small ring curve starting\nfrom (j 2 , aH ) = (1, 0).\nWe can also see the reason for the smaller area of small rings: a significant fraction of their\nenergy has to go into the (non-entropic) tension of wound strings, whereas for large rings the\nenergy is mostly spent into oscillations that contribute to the entropy. Two oppositely wound\nclosed strings in a small ring can intercommute and then unwind (or annihilate). More energy\n\n26\n\n\fis then available for oscillations, which increase the entropy (area), and so this provides a\nmechanism by which small rings decay into thermodynamically favoured large rings. Moreover,\nthe point at which both branches meet admits a natural interpretation: if we approach it from\nthe large ring branch, then we have a state of high excitation, with unwound strings so long that\nthey stretch almost all the way around the ring circle. If one of these long closed strings selfintersects after a turn around the circle, it can cut itself and rejoin into two oppositely wound\nstrings, thus connecting to the small ring branch. Additionally, if we put in some strings that\nwind in only one direction, we make a dipole ring. As expected by these arguments, adding\nthis wound strings, i.e., increasing q, has the effect of reducing the entropy for a given mass,\nagain in agreement with fig. 3.\nThis qualitative sketch provides a suggestive basis for the identification of the kind of string\nstates that correspond to each different black object, i.e., a complete stringy resolution of black\nhole non-uniqueness in five dimensions, but there remain obscure points. One puzzling feature\nis the absence of an infinite radius limit for the configurations conjectured to correspond to small\nrings. More quantitatively, it is unclear why the maximum value of j for small neutral rings is\n1, and not a distribution of values as could be naively expected if there can be configurations\nwith different numbers of strings and anti-strings in the ring. Or why the small ring branch\nfor N = 1 terminates before reaching the extremal limit. Presumably we require a deeper\ncomprehension of the equilibrium of forces in the ring to understand these issues, and decide\nif the picture above is tenable. Also, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of boosted straight\nstrings is known to parametrically match, at the correspondence point, to the entropy of highlyexcited fundamental strings with linear momentum [33]. It might be interesting to extend this\ncalculation to large rings and hopefully also to small rings.\nThe stability of rotating dipole rings is an intriguing question, as it is for all rotating black\nobjects in higher dimensions [1, 34, 35] (the stability problem in the static case has been\nsolved recently [36]). Obviously, the dipole ring can evolve into a neutral configuration without\nany gauge dipole field, since there is no conserved quantity associated with a dipole. So, for\nexample, the dipole ring could collapse into a MP black hole. Another possibility is that the\ndipole discharges via the formation of closed string loops formed just outside the inner rim\nof the ring (presumably via quantum effects), and which shrink to zero size radiating away\ntheir energy. This would gradually decrease the local charge of the ring, and depending on the\namount of spin that is lost, might end up in a MP black hole or a neutral black ring. Besides,\none expects thin dipole rings to suffer from the classical Gregory-Laflamme (GL) instability [37],\nwhich should form ripples along the ring, and these would cause the emission of gravitational\n\n27\n\n\fradiation. If Q is not changed under this process, which does not seem unlikely (no classical\n\nemission of string loops), then q would increase, and if the loss of spin were not too large, the\ndipole could evolve towards an extremal solution. It is unclear whether extremal and nearextremal rings should be GL-unstable or not. As the supersymmetric limit is approached the\nGL-unstable modes stretch to infinite wavelength. However, for these rings the supersymmetric\nlimit involves, in addition to extremality, taking the radius to infinity. It remains to be seen\nwhether extremal rings at finite radius can be stable under classical linearized perturbations.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Henriette Elvang, Rob Myers, Harvey Reall and Jorge Russo for conversations, comments and suggestions.
