We find that neutron-star asymmetries could, in principle,\nbe effective for inducing both radial and vertical oscillations of relevant amplitude while the binary companion might\npossibly produce significant radial oscillations but not vertical ones. Misaligned neutron-star quadrupole moments of a\nsize advocated elsewhere for explaining limiting neutron star periods could be large enough also for the present purpose.\nKey words. neutron stars \u2013 binary systems \u2013 QPOs \u2013 accretion discs\n\n1. Introduction\nQuasi-periodic oscillations of X-ray brightness (QPOs) have\nbeen observed in a number of accreting binary systems\ncontaining compact objects, both with neutron stars (see\nvan der Klis, 2000; Barret et al., 2005 for a review) and\nwith black holes (Remillard & McClintock, 2006). They\ncan have low frequencies (Hz) or high frequencies (kHz).\nThe observed kHz frequencies are comparable with the\nKeplerian and epicyclic frequencies in the inner parts of\nthe accretion disc (T\u00f6r\u00f6k, 2005) and the question arises of\nwhether they might be associated with forced resonant oscillations of the inner disc material. In order to initiate\nthese, some perturbation mechanism would be required.\nHere, we focus on neutron-star systems and investigate the\npossibility that gravitational perturbations caused either\nby the binary companion or by asymmetries of the neutron\nstar might provide this mechanism. (The case of the binary\ncompanion could be relevant also for black hole systems.)\nWe note that perturbations coming from the neutron star\ncan only be relevant for the innermost parts of the disc\n(because of the rapid fall-off of the force with distance) and\nhence are mainly associated with the picture for kHz QPO\nfrequencies rather than with that for the lower frequencies.\nIt is necessary that the mechanism should be a resonant\none since otherwise the response produced would certainly\nbe much too small to be of interest.\nSend offprint requests to: Stanislav Hled\u00edk\n\nThe two types of perturbation (from the neutron star\nand from the binary companion) clearly induce different\nbehaviours: the frequency of the varying force arising from\nthe influence on the disc of the binary companion is essentially equal to the disc rotation-frequency, whereas the\nmain frequency of the force caused by asymmetries of the\nneutron star is equal to the difference between the rotation frequencies of the disc and the neutron star (P\u00e9tri,\n2006). Resonance occurs at those points where one of the\nintrinsic oscillation frequencies of the disc matter coincides\nwith the forcing frequency. Following the discussion by\nLandau & Lifshitz (1976) for test particle motion (which\nwould need to be modified for fluid elements), the growth\nin amplitude of the oscillations of the particle within the\nlinear regime of forced resonance is given by\n\na(t) =\n\nfp\nt,\n2m0 \u03c9\n\n(1)\n\nwhere fp is the amplitude of the variations of the force, \u03c9\nis the frequency and m0 is the mass of the particle. This\nlinear regime ends when the oscillation amplitude a(t) becomes large enough so that non-linear phenomena and/or\ndissipative processes become relevant. Note that a(t) grows\nlinearly with time in this regime and so can become quite\nlarge even when the variations in the perturbing force are\nsmall.\n\n\fZ.

Gravitational perturbing force\n\n2.2. Binary companion\n\nWe consider here the situation illustrated in Fig. 1 with a\nbasically isotropic neutron star of mass MA and radius RA\nspinning about its rotation axis with angular velocity \u03a9A\nand with the symmetry plane of the accretion disc being orthogonal to the rotation axis. We use spherical polar coordinates (R, \u03b8, \u03c6) with the origin at the centre of the neutron\nstar. Possible neutron-star asymmetry is approximated by\na point-like source with mass m located on the surface of\nthe star at angle \u03b8 = \u03b8A . The binary companion (with mass\nMB ) is taken to be moving on an orbit at a constant distance\nd from the neutron star at \u03b8 = \u03b8B . For thin discs, the angular velocity profile \u03a9d (R) is generally well-approximated\nas being Keplerian (Novikov & Thorne, 1973) but for thick\n(or slim) discs, there is a deviation away from this because\nof the action of pressure forces (Jaroszy\u0144ski et al., 1980).\nWe here determine the radial and vertical components of\nthe gravitational force produced by the perturbing sources\nin a purely Newtonian way. This is an approximation, but\nwe do not expect that a relativistic analysis would greatly\nchange the qualitative features of our results. For simplicity the force will be determined in the equatorial plane,\ni.e., in the symmetry plane of the disc; this is completely\ncorrect for thin, Keplerian discs, and gives good estimates\nfor slim discs. We determine the time evolution of the perturbing force components for a fixed point on the disc with\ncoordinates (R, \u03b8 = \u03c0/2, \u03c6 = \u03a9d t), making the restriction\nRA < R < 10 RA since kHz QPOs are being considered. For\nthe binary companion, we assume d \u226b R, RB .\n\nThe binary companion is taken to be orbiting the neutron\nstar at a constant distance d, with angular velocity \u03a9B .\nThe vertical and radial components of the perturbing force\nacting on the accreting material are then given by\n\u0001\nFBV (t) = GMB /d2 cos \u03b8B\n\u0003\u22123/2\n\u0002\n(6)\n\u00d7 1 \u2212 2(R/d) sin \u03b8B cos \u03c9B t + (R/d)2\n\n2.1. Neutron-star asymmetry\nHere, and in the following, we consider the force acting on a\ncomoving unit mass element of the accretion disc at a given\nradius R. Using the quantities x \u2261 RA /R and \u03c9A \u2261 |\u03a9A \u2212\n\u03a9d |, the vertical component of the perturbing gravitational\nforce is given by\n\u0001\nFAV (t) = Gm/RA2 x3 cos \u03b8A\n\u0001\u22123/2\n,\n(2)\n\u00d7 1 \u2212 2x sin \u03b8A cos \u03c9A t + x2\nwhile the radial component is given by\n\u0001\nFAR (t) = Gm/RA2 x2 (1 \u2212 x sin \u03b8A cos \u03c9A t)\n\n\u00d7 1 \u2212 2x sin \u03b8A cos \u03c9A t + x2\n\n\u0001\u22123/2\n\n.\n\n(3)\n\nFBR (t) = (GMB /d2 ) [sin \u03b8B cos \u03c9B t \u2212 (R/d)]\n\u0003\u22123/2\n\u0002\n, (7)\n\u00d7 1 \u2212 2(R/d) sin \u03b8B cos \u03c9B t + (R/d)2\n\nwhere the relative angular velocity \u03c9B = |\u03a9B \u2212 \u03a9d | \u2248 \u03a9d .\nIn general, these relations represent anharmonically oscillating forces but we are taking R/d \u226a 1 and they then\nreduce to an approximate form which is harmonic with frequency \u03c9B \u2248 \u03a9d . The vertical force oscillates around its\nmean value with amplitude\nBV \u2248 3(GMB /d2 )(R/d) cos \u03b8B sin \u03b8B\n\n(8)\n\nand the radial force oscillates with amplitude\nBR \u2248 (GMB /d2 ) sin \u03b8B .\n\n(9)\n\n3. Magnitudes of the neutron-star asymmetries\nIn this section we give estimates for the magnitudes of\nneutron-star asymmetries arising in different ways. We first\nconsider classical crystalline mountains and magneticallyconfined accretion columns; both of these are found to be\ninadequate for the present purposes, however. We then\nturn to some different observationally-motivated possibilities which seem to be more promising.\n3.1. Isolated crystalline mountains\nAssuming that the basic nature of a mountain on the surface of a neutron star is the same as for mountains on planets, the pressure at the base of the mountain needs to be\nless than the maximum shear stress of the surface material. This pressure is given by Pmnt = \u03c1mnt gns hmnt , where\n\u03c1mnt is the average density of the material in the mountain, gns is the surface gravity of the neutron star and hmnt\n\n\fZ. Stuchl\u00edk et al.: Gravitational excitation of QPOs (RN)\n\nis the height of the mountain. The base of the mountain\nwould be located at the outermost solid surface layer of\nthe neutron star. The relevant density to take for this layer\nis rather uncertain; we will take it as being \u223c 106 g cm\u22123\nand put \u03c1mnt equal to that. The surface gravity is given\nby gns = GMA /RA2 . For a neutron star of mass 1.4 M\u2299 and\nradius 10 km, gns is 1.87 \u00d7 1014 cm s\u22122 .\nFollowing Strohmayer et al. (1991), the shear modulus\nof the neutron star surface material is taken to be\n0.1194\nn(Ze)2\n\u03bc=\n,\n(10)\n2\n1 + 1.781 \u00d7 (100/\u0393)\na\nwhere n is the number density of ions, a is the interionic distance, Z is the atomic number of the dominant\nionic species, and \u0393 is the Coulomb coupling parameter\n(\u0393 > 103 for all practical purposes). The maximum shear\nstrain in the surface of the neutron star has been calculated to be \u0398 \u223c 10\u22125 \u201310\u22123 (Smoluchowski & Welch, 1970),\nalthough there are suggestions that it might also be as\nhigh as 10\u22122 (Ushomirsky et al., 2000). Taking typical values Z = 26, n \u2243 1028 cm\u22123 and a \u2243 7 \u00d7 10\u221210 cm, the\ncorresponding maximum shear stress is then S = \u03bc\u0398 \u2243\n1018 \u20131021 dyn cm\u22122 . The maximum height of the mountain\nis obtained by setting Pmnt = S, which gives hmax\nmnt in the\nrange 0.01\u201310cm . Taking the highest of these values, we\nthen get the maximum possible mass of the mountain as\nbeing\n3\n9\n\u221224\n\u201310\u221225 MA\nmmnt \u223c \u03c1mnt (hmax\nmnt ) \u223c 10 g \u223c 10\n\n(11)\n\nwhich is too small to be relevant here.\n3.2. Accretion columns\nFor a neutron star with a strong magnetic field, accreting\nmatter close to it can be diverted away from the equatorial plane and form accretion columns above the magnetic\npoles (Woosley & Wallace, 1982; Hameury et al., 1983). If\nthe amount of matter in the columns is sufficiently large,\nthis can provide another source of neutron-star asymmetry which could again be modelled in terms of \"mountains\" (probably two symmetric ones in this case). This has\nbeen invoked in connection with gravitational-wave emission (Melatos & Payne, 2005) and we check here whether\nit could also be relevant in the present context.\nThe column height can be determined from the condition that the flow will start to spread out sideways when\nthe pressure of the matter in the column Pac becomes large\nenough to bend the magnetic field lines outwards, typically\nwhen it is about a hundred times greater than the confining\nmagnetic pressure, i.e. when\n\u00012\nPac \u223c 4 \u00d7 1024 dyn cm\u22122 Bs /1012 G ,\n(12)\n\nwhere Bs is the strength of the surface dipole field\n(Brown & Bildsten, 1998). For having hydrostatic equilibrium, this pressure should be the same as that elsewhere at the same level in the crust. In the density range\n106 g cm\u22123 \u2264 \u03c1 \u2264 1010 g cm\u22123 the pressure can be expressed using the fitting formula log P = 13.65 + 1.45 log \u03c1\n(Baym et al., 1971) and the relation between the field\nstrength and the density at the bottom of the column\nis then given by (\u03c1bot /106 g cm\u22123 ) \u223c 36(Bs /1012 G)1.38 .\nUsing this, the scale height of the column, hac is then\n\u00010.62\nhac \u223c Pac /(\u03c1bot gns ) \u223c 103 cm Bs /1012 G\n.\n(13)\n\n3\n\nFollowing Shapiro & Teukolsky (1983), the cross-sectional\narea of the column is estimated as\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22124/7 \u0012\n\u00131/7\nBs\nMA\n10\n2\nAxs \u223c 10 cm\n1012 G\n1.4 M\u2299\n!2/7\n\u00139/7\n\u0012\n\u1e40\nRA\n, (14)\n\u00d7\n106 cm\n10\u22129 M\u2299 /yr\nwhere \u1e40 is the accretion rate, which we normalise to a\ntypical value for LMXBs.

Quadrupole moments inferred from limiting neutron star\nspin rates\nBildsten (1998) noted that the spin frequencies for many\naccreting weakly-magnetised neutron stars were thought\nto lie in a rather narrow range around 300 Hz, which is\na much lower frequency than that corresponding to centrifugal break-up. Since these objects are thought to have\nbeen accreting for long enough so as to gain sufficient angular momentum to reach the break-up limit, it seemed that\nsome mechanism was halting the spin-up. Despite the fact\nthat the spread of spin frequencies is now thought to be less\npeaked (see Manchester et al., 2005), the issue of why spinup should be halted before the break-up limit is reached\nremains a relevant one. Bildsten suggested that this might\nbe caused by the accretion torque becoming balanced by a\ngravitational-wave torque resulting from an asymmetry of\nthe neutron star. Taking the asymmetry to be represented\nby an l = m = 2 perturbation, one finds that the magnitude of the misaligned quadrupole moment required for\nattaining this equilibrium at a frequency \u03bds is given by\n\u0012\n\u00131/4\n\u00131/4 \u0012\nMA\nRA\n37\n2\nQeq = 3.5 \u00d7 10 g cm\n1.4 M\u2299\n106 cm\n!1/2\n\u0010 \u03bd \u0011\u22125/2\n\u1e40\ns\n\u00d7\n.

Stuchl\u00edk et al.: Gravitational excitation of QPOs (RN)\n\n4\n\nVarious mechanisms have been suggested in the literature\nfor producing such a value (or even higher), involving global\ndeformations of the neutron star rather than an isolated\nmountain on the surface (Bildsten, 1998; Ushomirsky et al.,\n2000; Haskell et al., 2006, etc.). We will not enter into details of this here but we note that values of the deformation\nlarge enough to be capable of explaining the limitation of\nneutron star spin-up, as suggested by Bildsten, may also\nbe large enough for the present purposes: in the next section, we take the value for the point mass given by Eq. (17)\nwith the canonical parameter values, and check whether\nthis same value \u223c 10\u22128 MA might also be large enough to\nbe relevant for inducing the QPO behaviour.\n\na plausible mechanism for inducing kHz QPO behaviour\nalthough many details remain to be worked out (in particular concerning the response of the fluid medium and the\nproduction of the luminosity variations). The influence of\nthe binary companion could possibly be effective in providing the perturbations but the more likely possibility is that\nthey might be produced by the neutron-star asymmetries.\nIt is striking that the same magnitude for the misaligned\nquadrupole moment as advocated elsewhere for explaining\nlimiting neutron star periods, seems also to give a plausible\nmechanism for inducing QPO behaviour.\n\n4. Discussion and conclusions\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nHere, we discuss whether the effect of the neutron-star\nasymmetries or of the binary companion could be large\nenough to account for excitation of the QPO phenomenon.\nIn our simplified picture (c.f. Eq. (1)), the excitation time\nfor the amplitude a of resonant oscillations to grow to a\nparticular value is given by\n\u0010 a \u0011 \u0010 \u03b1 \u0011 \u0012 f \u0013\u22121\np\ntex =\n\u03c4K ,\n(18)\nR\n\u03c0\nf0\n\nThis work was supported by Czech grants MSM 4781305903\nand GA\u010cR 202/06/0041.\n\nwhere fp is the amplitude of the perturbing force acting on\nunit mass, f0 = GMA /R2 is the main gravitational force\nfrom the central object, \u03c4K = 2\u03c0/\u03a9K is the period of circular Keplerian motion at the location being considered\nand the epicyclic frequency of the perturbation being excited is \u03c9 = \u03b1\u03a9K . The dimensionless radial and vertical\n\"epicyclic functions\" satisfy \u03b1 \u2264 1 everywhere. Note that\nsince \u03c4K \u223c 10\u22123 s, the amplitude amplification in 1 second\nis \u223c 103 . The ratio a/R needs to grow to > 10\u22123 in order to\npotentially explain the QPO behaviour and it would need\nto do that within \u223c 103 s to account for the QPO phenomena seen in atoll sources.\nIn the case of a binary companion, for the radial perturbing force one has\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012 \u00132\nfp\nMB\nR\n\u223c\nf0\nMA\nd\n\u00132\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0012\nR 1010 cm\nMB\n,\n(19)\n\u223c 10\u22129\n0.1 MA\n106 cm\nd\n\nwhere we have normalised to typical parameter values. This\ncould produce a/R \u223c 10\u22123 at times tex . 103 s, but there\nis a problem for it producing resonances in the innermost\nparts of the disc because of having \u03c9B \u2248 \u03a9K . The corresponding vertical force is smaller by at least four orders of\nmagnitude and is clearly irrelevant. (Note that the vertical force is a tidal force whereas the radial one is a direct\ngravitational attraction; also, \u03b8B is probably rather close to\n\u03c0/2.)\nFor the neutron star asymmetries, we focus on the case\nof the misaligned quadrupole moments where fp /f0 can be\n\u223c 10\u22128 in the inner parts of the disc for both radial and\nvertical oscillations (taking mquad = 10\u22128 MA ). For this,\na/R could reach 10\u22123 in . 102 s, which encourages further\ninvestigation of this scenario.\nWe conclude that at least one of the types of gravitational perturbation considered in this paper might provide\n\nReferences\nBarret, D., Olive, J.-F., & Miller, M.
