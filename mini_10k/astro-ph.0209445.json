No evolution in the rest K \u2032 -band\nluminosity function can also be consistent with the hierarchical galaxy formation\nmodel if M/LK decreases with redshift, that is, if the number density of K \u2032 -band\nluminosity- selected galaxies does not significantly change with redshift while the\nnumber density of stellar mass-selected galaxies decreases with look-back time.\nThis trend corresponds to the evolution of the rest UV(2000\u00c5) \u2212 K \u2032 color, which\ngets bluer with increasing redshift.

As a\nconsequence, the contribution to the global star formation rate of our K \u2032 -selected\ngalaxies is about 42% of that derived from the integration of luminosity function\nof Lyman break galaxies at z = 3.

Previous deep spectroscopic surveys have shown several\nevolutionary trends for galaxies at 0 . z . 1, especially for the evolution of luminosity\nfunctions (LFs), which is one of the fundamental observational tools to trace the galaxy\nevolution. Lilly et al. (1995) have shown that the LF for red galaxies does not evolve\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nsignificantly over 0 . z . 1, which infers that red massive galaxies must have already been\nassembled by z = 1. On the other hand, their blue subsample is evolving, which indicates\nthat they are formed later than the red subsample. Cowie et al. (1996) have shown the\nevidence of the \"downsizing\" trend in which more massive galaxies appear to be forming at\nhigher redshifts.\nAlthough it is important to see these evolutionary trends in the earlier epoch beyond\nz = 1, it is difficult to construct a large galaxy sample in the familiar optical wavelength\nexcept for the distinct high z star-forming populations of Lyman break galaxies and/or Ly\u03b1\nemitters at z & 3 (Steidel et al. 1999; Ouchi et al. 2003, Paper II). There are some possible\ninterpretations of such luminous high z galaxies such as a core of today's massive L > L\u2217\ngalaxies (Steidel et al. 1996) or as a low-mass starbursting building blocks of the more massive\ngalaxies seen today (Lowenthal et al. 1997). However, it remains uncertain how these z > 3\ngalaxies are related to present-day galaxies.\nOne of the explicit difficulties in tracing systematically the evolution of galaxies is that\na single observed frame does not correspond to a single rest frame over wide redshift range,\nsay 0 . z . 3. The rest-optical frame in which we have seen the evolution trend at 0 . z . 1\nshifts to the NIR region at z & 1.5. An observation in wide wavelength range is undoubtedly\nrequired to know the SEDs of galaxies and follow their evolution based on the same rest\nframe in which we can draw almost similar stellar contents at any redshifts.\nThere are two approaches to probe the rest-frame luminosity of galaxies. One is to\nchange the observed band accordingly and follow the redshifting rest frame. This straightforward approach was taken by many studies. Cowie, Songaila, & Barger (1999) traced the\nrest-B band up to z = 1 by UBV I multiband observation. Furusawa et al. (2003, Paper\nIV) used multicolor BV Ri\u2032 z \u2032 bands and traced the rest B band LF up to z = 1.25. NIR\nphotometry for Lyman break galaxies enables them to derive their rest V -band luminosity\nat z = 3 (Shapley et al. 2001). This approach gives a reliable way to trace the rest frame\ndirectly, though the study is restricted to a single rest band.\nThe other approach is to utilize the best-fit SED templates determined on photometric\nredshift method (Sawicki, Lin & Yee 1997; Rudnick et al. 2001). As have been already\nmentioned by many authors, the photometric redshift technique has less precision for redshift\nestimates than the spectroscopic redshift. However, spectroscopic redshifts are practical only\nfor bright objects. Photometric redshifts can be extensively applied to fainter objects with\na fair degree of confidence. They are also of great use in constructing a statisticaly large\nsample in the redshift range between z = 1.5 and z = 2.5, where redshifts can be identified\nonly by NIR spectroscopy. It works predominantly as a statistical technique rather than as\na constraint on parameters that determine the SED of an individual object. Studies based\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\non the photometric redshifts and those based on the spectroscopic redshifts complement\neach other. If the SED of each sample galaxy in wide wavelength is given, the rest-frame\nluminosity of the galaxy can be estimated. This method has the advantage to deriving the\nrest-frame luminosity at any redshift and at any wavelength, though the estimated luminosity\ninherits an uncertainty in determining the photometric redshift.\nIn this study, we have constructed a very deep K \u2032 band-selected sample of galaxies.\nWe then adopt the second approach described above with photometric redshifts derived\nfrom multicolor BV RIz \u2032 JK \u2032 deep images and investigate the evolution of the LFs in the\nthree (K \u2032 , B, and UV) rest-frame bands out to z = 3.5 where the K \u2032 -band still traces the\nrest wavelength longer than an age-sensitive spectral break at 4000\u00c5. NIR band-selected\nsamples may provide significant advantages over optical band-selected samples in studying\ngalaxy evolution due to smaller extinction by dust and less type-dependent k\u2212corrections\n(Mannucci et al. 2001) at these wavelengths. Moreover, NIR selection provides samples that\nare not biased towards star-forming galaxies and allows estimation of the mass of galaxies\nover a wide range of redshift (Saracco et al. 2001). NIR photometry in general improves the\nestimate of photometric redshift (e.g., Bolzonella, Miralles, & Pello 2000).\nThe Subaru Deep Field (SDF) was imaged quite deeply at near-infrared with wide field\nnear infrared camera CISCO and yielded some of the faintest galaxies ever observed, down\nto magnitudes of J = 25.5 and K \u2032 = 24.5 (Maihara et al. 2001, Paper I), which is much\ndeeper than most of previous K \u2032 -band surveys (e.g., Cowie et al. 1996; Barger et al. 1999;\nFontana et al. 2000; Rudnick et al. 2001). The field was well selected, taking care to avoid\nlarge Galactic extinction and nearby clusters of galaxies and to get smaller airmass than the\nHDF at Mauna Kea (Paper I). The following optical imaging enabled us to estimate the\nphotometric redshifts of these faint objects and offered the discovery of faint high z object\ncandidates. In the SDF, we have already evaluated the number counts in J and K \u2032 bands, the\nnear-infrared color distribution, and contribution to extragalactic background light (Paper I,\nsee also Totani et al. 2001a). Totani et al. (2001b) have investigated a detailed comparison of\nthe number counts, colors, and size distribution for the SDF galaxies with theoretical galaxy\nformation models. Nagashima et al. (2003) have also analyzed the SDF galaxies by using\na semianalytic model of galaxy formation based on the CDM model. In this paper, we will\ncompare the redshift distribution with their models.\nThis paper will be organized as follows. We present the process to construct the K \u2032 limited sample of SDF galaxies and estimating photometric redshifts as well as their spectroscopic calibration in \u00a72. In \u00a73, we show the redshift distribution of our sample and\ncompare it with galaxy formation models. We discuss the evolution of LFs on rest K \u2032 , B,\nand UV(2000\u00c5) bands in \u00a74 and the evolution of rest UV\u2212K \u2032 color in \u00a75. We will also\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\ndescribe in \u00a76 the evaluation of star formation rate density (SFRD) derived from our LF\nestimate. We give a summary in \u00a77. Throughout this paper we assume a flat, matter dominated universe (\u03a9m = 1) with H0 = 75kms\u22121 Mpc\u22121 to compare with other major previous\nobservations.\n\n2.\n\nK \u2032 band-selected Galaxy Sample\n2.1.\n\nData\n\nWe have used a deep multicolor data set of BV RIz \u2032 JK \u2032 images taken with the Subaru\ntelescope on the Subaru Deep Field (SDF). The SDF is centered on \u03b1 = 13h 24m 21.s 38; \u03b4 =\n+27\u25e6 29\u2032 23.\u2032\u2032 0(J2000). The J and K \u2032 imagings and data reductions are described in the\nprevious paper (Paper I). The optical follow-up imaging observations were carried out during\nthe commissioning runs of the FOCAS (Kashikawa et al. 2002) and Suprime-Cam (Miyazaki\net al. 1998) in 2001 February to June. In this study, we used the Johnson B-, Kron-Cousins\nR- and I-band images taken with FOCAS and Johnson V - and SDSS z \u2032 - band images taken\nwith Suprime-Cam. The observation and data reduction of the V and z \u2032 data, which are one\nof the wide field imaging data for the SDF, will be described in coming paper (Furusawa et\nal. 2003, Paper IV). Here we briefly describe the imaging data of B, R, and I taken with\nFOCAS.\nFOCAS has a field of view as large as 6\u2032 \u03c6, which could entirely cover not only the SDF\n2\u2032 \u00d7 2\u2032 itself but also its flanking fields. The SDF has flanking fields 25 arcmin2 in total size\nsurrounding the SDF, though their limiting magnitude in K \u2032 (K \u2032 \u2264 20.5) is fairly shallower\nthan that of the central field. FOCAS has a couple of 2048 \u00d7 4096 pixel CCD chips with\nthe pixel scale 0.103 arcsec/pix. The typical seeing size was 0.6 \u2212 0.8 arcsec. The total\nintegration time was 2.5hr, 4hr, and 1hr for B, R, and I bands respectively.\nThe B, R, and I images were reduced in a standard manner. After flat-fielding, we\nhave corrected the image distortion caused by the optics of FOCAS and the telescope. The\nundistorted images have accuracy of 1.0 pix rms. This distortion pattern has been confirmed\nto be independent of the flexure of the telescope and the instrument. The image shift caused\nby the flexure was about 0.6 pix within the maximum exposure time of 30min. Relative\nsensitivity of two CCDs was corrected based on the difference of sky brightness assuming\nthat the sky is uniform over the field of view. Actually, the relative ratios of sky brightness of\ntwo CCDs on the same exposure were stable with 1% fluctuation. The sky was determined by\nfitting the unvignetted area of each frame with two-dimensional 3rd or 4th order polynomials\nand subtracted. The relative shifts and rotations among dithered frames were measured and\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nfixed using the positions of several point sources. Then they were stacked each other using\nthe IMCOMBINE task in IRAF. Magnitude zero points were calibrated to the JohnsonCousins system using Landolt photometric standard stars. The accuracy of the zero points\nis estimated to be in the range 0.03 \u2212 0.08mag. The magnitudes have also been corrected\nfor the Galactic absorption, using E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.018 derived from Schlegel, Flinkbeiner &\nDavis (1998), yielding AB = 0.074mag, AV = 0.056 mag, AR = 0.046 mag, AI = 0.033 mag,\nAz \u2032 = 0.025mag, AJ = 0.015 mag, and AK \u2032 = 0.006 mag.\nThe summary of optical imaging data used in this study is presented in Table 1. The\n5\u03c3 limiting magnitudes in Vega system within 2.\u2032\u2032 0 aperture for these images are B \u2264 28.08,\nV \u2264 26.28, R \u2264 27.88, I \u2264 25.93, z \u2032 \u2264 24.27, J \u2264 25.11, and K \u2032 \u2264 23.73.\nAmong seven images, the J-band image has the smallest area, 2\u2032 \u00d7 2\u2032 , on which the\ndeep K \u2032 -band imaging has carried out. Therefore we first rescaled all the data to the same\npixel scale (0.\u2032\u2032 103 /pix) as the B, R, and I data, corrected relative rotation based on the\npositions of several bright point sources, and extracted the 1.\u2032 90 \u00d7 1.\u2032 97 region common to\nthe J- and K \u2032 -band images for further analysis. The error of this image translation was\nbelow 0.02 arcsec.\n\n2.2.\n\nObject Detection and Photometry\n\nWe extracted objects using SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996). The objects were\nextracted from the K \u2032 -band image as a reference image and photometric measurements\nwere performed on the other image for the exact positions where sources were detected\non the reference image. We choose a 4.0pix FWHM Gaussian convolution kernel in object\ndetection on the reference K \u2032 -band image. We used a detection threshold of 24.1 mag/arcsec2\ncorresponding to the 1.5\u03c3 above the background noise level in K \u2032 band, the same as in Paper\nI.\nTo measure colors of detected objects, aperture photometry was carried out for seeingcorrected images, which were created by convolving Gaussian filters to match the seeing\nsize to that of the V band, the largest among the seven images. At first we used a fixed\naperture. However, it was difficult to choose an adequate aperture size because photometry\nwith a large aperture is affected by close neighboring objects while a small aperture does not\ncover the same physical sizes for both nearby objects and distant objects at the same time.\nFinally we chose an aperture size adjusted for each object size but kept identical for all seven\nimages. To choose the adequate aperture size in deriving colors of objects, we have tried\nmany times with different aperture sizes and confirmed the consistency between the resulting\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nphotometric redshifts and spectroscopic redshifts for calibration samples (see Section 2.3).\nWe found that 2\u00d7FWHM (FWHM was measured on K \u2032 -band image) aperture for each\nobject is the optimum aperture size to derive correct photometric redshifts. In this way, we\nhave measured total magnitudes (\"MAG BEST\" magnitutudes from SExtractor), 2\u00d7FWHM\naperture magnitudes for all the seven images. It should be noted that the 2\u00d7FWHM aperture\nmagnitude is only used for SED fitting in deriving the photometric redshift, and further\nanalysis is based on the total magnitude. The nine objects that have stellarity> 0.9 with\nK \u2032 \u2264 23.0 were eliminated as Galactic stars from our galaxy sample. We have also removed\n12 objects whose photometry is strongly affected by nearby bright stars in one of the seven\nband images.\n\u2032\nOur final K \u2032 -selected catalog contains 439 objects with the magnitude limit Ktot\n\u2264 24.0.\nAccording to Paper I, the completeness is over 70% at this limiting magnitude.\n\n2.3.\n\nPhotometric Redshifts\n\nWe used the publicly available Hyperz code by Bolzonella, Miralles, & Pello (2000) to\ndetermine photometric redshifts for our seven-band BV RIz \u2032 JK \u2032 photometry. The Hyperz\ncode derives a photometric redshift for each input multi-photometry set according to the\nstandard SED fitting minimization procedure. The detail of the method as well as discussions\nabout the accuracy of evaluated redshifts are presented in Bolzonella, Miralles, & Pello\n(2000), therefore we describe here briefly about our choices of major input parameters. We\nused five (Burst, E, Sa, Sc, and Im) synthetic galaxy SED templates of Bruzal & Charlot\nmodel (GISSEL98, Bruzal & Charlot 1993) to compare with the observed SED. The default\nSED templates applied in Hyperz assume the Miller & Scalo IMF from 0.1M\u2299 to 125M\u2299 ,\nsolar metallicity Z = Z\u2299 = 0.02, ages ranging from 106 yr to 2 \u00d7 1010 yr, and Madau (1995)'s\nformula for continuum depression due to the intergalactic absorption blueward of Lyman\n\u03b1 emission. The adopted SED templates are assumed for an instantaneous single-burst\nSFR model for \"Burst\" SED, and exponentially decaying SFRs with e-folding timescales of\n1, 3, 15 Gyr and infinity (i.e., constant SFR) to match the colors of present-day galaxies\nof different spectral types from \"E\" to \"Im\". Though three more additional spectral type\ntemplates can be applied in Hyperz, the accuracy for photometric redshift zphot estimate was\nfound to be unchanged when applying all the eight templates. We have chosen a Calzetti\netal. (2000)'s extinction law with AV ranging between 0.0 and 1.8. The step in redshift in\nsearching the solutions between z = 0 and z = 7 is \u2206z = 0.1, though the resolution in the\nfinal minimization is 10 times better. The results are not significantly affected by the choice\nof smaller \u2206z. We have also constrained on the age of the template to be less than the age of\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nthe universe at the redshift under consideration. The transmission curve for a given filter set\nwas defined based on the real measured curve for each instrument. An uncertainty of derived\nphotometric redshift for each object was estimated from the \u03c72 probability distribution at\nthe confidence level 90% derived in SED template matching, which will be shown later. As\nexpected, the error becomes larger as K \u2032 magnitude goes fainter.\nWe examined the accuracy of our determination of photometric redshifts, zphot , against\nspectroscopic redshifts, zspec . We have measured spectroscopic redshifts for 76 galaxies in 5\u2032 \u00d7\n5\u2032 field centered on SDF. All these spectroscopic data were taken during the commissioning\nruns of FOCAS MOS mode in April and May, 2001. The spectra cover 4700 \u2212 9000\u00c5 with\na pixel resolution of 2.8\u00c5 under the 0.\u2032\u2032 8 \u2212 1.\u2032\u2032 0 seeing size and were reduced in a standard\nmanner.\nIn this 5\u2032 \u00d75\u2032 SDF flanking fields, J-band data are not available except for the central 2\u2032 \u00d7\n2\u2032 region and the K \u2032 -band image has shallower limiting magnitudes, K \u2032 < 20.5. Five galaxies\nof 76 galaxies belong to the SDF central field in which J-band photometry is available. We\nhave confirmed an excellent agreement of the estimated zphot between the photometric data\nsets with and without J-band for these five galaxies. The comparison of zphot with zspec for\nour spectroscopic sample is shown in Figure 1, in which we found good agreement, though\nwe don't have a large enough spectroscopic galaxy sample at 1.5 < z. The mean error is\n\u2206z = hzspec \u2212 zphot i = \u22120.038 with \u03c3 = 0.207. The large inaccuracy seen in z \u2264 0.4 would be\ncaused by the lack of U\u2212band photometry which can detect a Balmer break at this redshift\nrange. If objects with z < 0.4 are removed, the accuracy improves to \u03c3 = 0.178. Note that\nwe don't have any apparent catastrophic errors, though the spectroscopic sample itself is\nsmall. If five objects with \u2206z > 0.4 are removed, the accuracy improves to \u03c3 = 0.160.\n\n3.\n\nRedshift Distribution\n\nWe describe in this section the derived redshift distributions of our sample. Figure 2\nshows the K \u2032 -z relation. The error bars of the determined zphot values are estimated from\nthe \u03c72 probability distribution at confidence level 90% derived in SED template matching.\nFigure 3 shows the redshift distribution of our K \u2032 -selected sample. The distribution has a\npeak around z = 0.8 which is slightly larger than the N(z) peak around z = 0.5 \u2212 0.6 derived\nby Fontana et al. (1999) or Rudnick et al. (2001) for K . 21 samples which include HDF-N,S\nfields. However, if we restrict our sample to brighter galaxies having K \u2032 \u2264 21.0, the peak\nmoves slightly toward a lower z at z = 0.6. The number density of galaxies at 1 < z < 1.5\nis 4.8 galaxies/arcmin2 at K \u2032 \u2264 21.0, which is consistent with the result of Fontana et al.\n(1999) of 4.4 galaxies/arcmin2 at K \u2032 \u2264 21.0. Thus, our N(z) is consistent with those of\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nFontana et al. (1999) and Rudnick et al. (2001).\nWe can use this overall redshift distribution of K \u2032 band-selected galaxies to compare\nthe predictions of theoretical models of galaxy formation. The redshift distribution for the\nK-selected galaxy sample was first pointed out by Kauffmann & Charlot (1998, KC98) as an\neffective tool to discriminate amoung galaxy formation models. The hierarchical clustering\nmodel, in which massive galaxies were assembled much more recently through merging of\nsmall galaxies, predicts less galaxy abundance at high z (z > 1) than that expected from\nthe pure luminosity evolution (PLE) model. The recent results of Fontana et al. (1999) and\nRudnick et al. (2001) for the K \u2032 \u2264 21 sample were both consistent with the hierarchical\nclustering model. Since our K \u2032 -selected sample is much deeper than Fontana et al. (1999)\nand Rudnick et al. (2001) by 3mag, the derived redshift distribution reflects both a high z\n(z > 2) population and intrinsically faint population in the local universe and is crucial and\nuseful in reconciling observation with theoretical models. Actually, the fraction of galaxies\nat z \u2265 1.6 detected in K \u2032 \u2264 21 sample of Fontana et al. (1999) was only 9%.\nFollowing the same manner as KC98 and previous observations, Figure 4 demonstrates\nthe normalized cumulative redshift histogram for our K \u2032 -selected sample, as well as the theoretical predictions of both the PLE and hierarchical clustering models. The thick solid\nhistograms show the results of observation, while other lines show the model predictions.\nWe have carried out Monte Carlo realizations to see the distortion that the error of our\nderived photometric redshift could cause on the resulted N(z). At first, we have created a\n\"pseudo-galaxy-catalog\" in which redshift of each galaxy was assigned to the photometric\nredshift solution plus a random error perturbed in the 90% range of confidence interval in the\nSED \u03c72 fitting procedure (same as the error bars denoted in Figure 2). In this process, magnitude of each galaxy was also assigned with a random error perturbed within the measured\nphotometric error by SExtractor. We assumed here that the error in photometric redshifts is\nindependent of the photometric error, though a large photometric error would cause a large\nerror of photometric redshift in most cases. The redshift distribution is recalculated for this\nsample. We repeated the process of generating such pseudo-galaxy-catalogs 200 times and\ninvestigated the scatter of derived redshift distribution. The shaded regions in Figure 4 show\nthe \u00b13\u03c3 deviated counts estimated by this method.\nThe thick dashed lines show the PLE model by Totani et al. (2001b). The model\nnormalizes its number density of galaxies at z = 0 by the B band luminosity function, and\nit probes the evolution backward in time. Galaxies are classified into six morphological\ntypes of E/S0, Sab, Sbc, Scd, Sdm, and the distinct population of dwarf elliptical galaxies.\nTheir luminosity and SED evolutions are described by a standard galaxy evolution model of\nArimoto & Yoshii (1987) and Arimoto, Yoshii & Takahara (1992). All galaxies are simply\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nassumed to be formed at a single redshift, zF = 5. A reasonable evaluation of dust extinction\nby a screen model, and selection effects such as cosmological dimming of surface brightness\nare taken into account. The details of the model are described in Yoshii (1993) and Totani\n& Yoshii (2000). Their selection criteria for object detection are completely the same as ours\nand those in Paper I. This PLE model, which takes account the two distict populations of\ngiant elliptical galaxies and dwarf elliptical galaxies, was found to match extremely well with\nthe observed K-band galaxy counts on the SDF beyond K > 22.5 where the PLE model\nwith a single elliptical population could not explain the observed galaxy abundance. In their\noriginal model of Totani et al. (2001b) they have predicted the N(z) for the SDF based on an\nisophotal magnitude in which selection effects are easy to take into account. We recalculated\nthe N(z) predicted by the model based on the total magnitude in this study.\nOn the other hand, the thick dotted lines represent the semianalytical hierarchical galaxy\nformation model by Nagashima et al. (2003). This model is based on the structure formation\ntheory in the CDM model, which corresponds to the hierarchical clustering of dark halos,\nand contains some important physical processes concerned with the evolution of the baryonic\ncomponents such as gas cooling, star formation, supernova feedback and galaxy mergers. In\nthis model, merging histories of dark halos are realized by using a Monte Carlo method\nassuming a power spectrum of initial density fluctuation in a Gaussian random field, and\nthen, the above baryonic processes are followed in each dark halo. Thus star formation\nhistories, luminosities and colors of individual galaxies are predicted with this model. The\ndetails of the model itself are presented in Nagashima et al. (2001) in which the model well\nreproduces the local luminosity function, the H I gas mass fraction, galaxy sizes and so on.\nThe Nagashima et al. (2003) model employed in this study improves on the Nagashima et\nal. (2001) model by taking account almost the same selection effects as those in Totani et al.\n(2001b) and dust extinction, and can predict the number counts of galaxies consistent with\nthat of observed on the SDF. Note that the model of Totani et al. (2001b) was calculated\nfor a cosmology with \u03a9m = 0.2 and \u03a9\u03bb = 0.8 and that of Nagashima et al. (2003) was\ncalculated with \u03a9m = 0.3 and \u03a9\u03bb = 0.7 as were those of their original models, whereas\nan overall distribution of observed photometric redshift does not depend on cosmology. In\nthe brightest 19 < K \u2032 \u2264 21 bin, we also overlay the model predictions of the PLE and\nhierarchical clustering models of KC98 for comparison.\nIt should be noted that the hierarchical clustering model apparently shows a strong\ndeficiency compared with the observed N(z), especially at high redshifts (z > 2). In the 22 <\nK \u2032 \u2264 23 bin, which contains 119 sample galaxies and still attains the 100% completeness,\nthe PLE model agrees with the observed count better than hierarchical galaxy formation\nmodel does. The PLE model can account for the abundance of the high-z (z > 2) galaxies.\nOn the other hand, its underprediction of the high-z galaxy abundance as compared with\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nthat of the PLE model of KC98 is attributed to the dust evaluation in the model.\nWe performed a two-sample form of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (K-S test) to see the\nstatistical agreement between observation and models. The chance probability, as well as the\n\u03c72 values (in parentheses) are listed in Table 2. The K-S test accepts at the 1% significance\nlevel the hypothesis that the observation and the PLE model in the 19 < K \u2032 \u2264 23 bins\nare drawn from the same distribution, while the hierarchical galaxy formation model agrees\nwith observation only in the bright 19 < K \u2032 \u2264 22 bins. In the faintest 23 < K \u2032 \u2264 24 bin\nboth the model predictions are found to be different from the observation. In this bin, the\nobserved count shows a high z tail which may be an effect of having more galaxies at high\nz and fewer galaxies at low z than in the models. Though the error-shaded regions seem\nto be distributed below the observed counts, it is partly because the pseudo-galaxy catalog\nlacks the objects whose reassigned magnitudes are beyond the limiting magnitude K \u2032 = 24.0.\nNote that the completeness of the sample is 100% at K \u2032 = 23.5, though 70% at K \u2032 = 24.0\n(Paper I). In the galaxy count, the model prediction begins to show a slight deviation from\nthe observation at this faint magnitude (Totani et al. 2001b; Nagashima et al. 2003). The\ndiscrepancy in this faintest bin is presumably caused by the large photometric errors which\ngive incorrect solutions of photometric redshifts. More detailed refinements of the model\nmay also be required.\nAs noted above, previous works on the KC98 test such as Fontana et al. (1999) and\nRudnick et al. (2001) found that their N(z) is well described with the hierarchical clustering\nmodel prediction and that the PLE model overpredicts the abundance at all redshifts. Our\nobserved N(z) itself is consistent with those observed by Fontana et al. (1999) and Rudnick\net al. (2001) at least at K \u2032 \u2264 21, and the KC98 test with our N(z) would give the same\nconclusion if we adopt the model predictions of KC98. In this study, we introduce more\nrealistic models of PLE and hierarchical galaxy formation that take account of both the selection effects of the sample and dust extinction, and found that the PLE model is favored by\nthe observed N(z), while the hierarchical galaxy formation model prediction is substantially\nbelow the observed N(z) at high z. Cimatti et al. (2002) concluded that their spectroscopic\nredshift distribution at Ks < 20 of the K20 survey is consistent with the PLE models that\ntake into account the selection effects and dust extinction. It might suggest that we need\nsome additional physical processes in the CDM model. We note, however, that the result is\nobtained on the very small field of the sky, therefore it should be confirmed by a future deep\nand wide-field K-selected sample.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n4.\n\nEvolution of Rest-frame Luminosity Functions\n\nUsing the estimated photometric redshift catalog, we now investigate the galaxy population and its evolution by means of luminosity functions. Our wide wavelength coverage\nand SED estimate for each sample galaxy allow us to derive LFs in the three rest-frame K \u2032 ,\nB, and UV(2000\u00c5) bands. We will investigate the evolution of rest-frame LFs at z < 3.5,\nwhere K \u2032 -band traces the rest-frame wavelength longer than 4000\u00c5. Though it is quite interesting to see the difference of rest-frame LFs for a blue or red subsample (e.g., Lilly et al.\n1995) or a spectral type (e.g., Folkes et al. 1999) subsample, our sample is not so large as\nto be subdivided into small subsamples with enough statistical confidence. Such a detailed\nanalysis would be possible in the future when a large NIR imaging survey is carried out.\n\n4.1.\n\nRest K \u2032 Frame Luminosity Function\n\nFirst, we derive the rest K \u2032 -band luminosity functions. For each galaxy we have determined a rest-frame absolute K \u2032 magnitude, MK \u2032 as\nMK \u2032 = mK \u2032 \u2212 5log(dL /10pc) \u2212 k(z),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere dL is the luminosity distance and mK \u2032 is the apparent K \u2032 magnitude. The\nk\u2212correction k(z) can be derived from the best-fit SED template for each galaxy.\nTo determine the LFs we use a traditional 1/Vmax method (Felten 1977),\n\u0014Z zmax\n\u0015\u22121\ndV\n4\u03c0 X\ndz\n,\n\u03c6(M)dM =\nd\u03c9\ndz\nzmin\n\n(2)\n\nwhere dV /dz is the comoving differential volume. The limits zmin and zmax are defined\nas the smallest and the largest redshifts, respectively, that a given galaxy could have and\nstill be included in a sample (see detail in Ellis et al. 1996). The sum is carried out over\nall galaxies in the sample lying within the specified range of redshift and magnitude. The\nvolume is based on an effective solid angle, d\u03c9, of the survey of 3.739 arcmin2 .\nThe rest K \u2032 frame LFs for four redshift intervals at 0.6 < z \u2264 3.5 are shown in Figure 5.\nWe have neither enough sample galaxies to derive a reliable LF nor good accuracy in redshift\nidentification at z < 0.6, so we omit this redshift interval. Instead, we refer the local K-band\nLF derived by Loveday (2000) for the Stromlo-APM Redshift Survey, shown as a dotted line\non each frame in Figure 5. Although Loveday's sample is smaller than that used in another\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nlocal K-band LF of 2dF survey (Cole et al. 2001), it extends to a magnitude as faint as\nMK = \u221216, with smaller statistical error, which is adequate to compare with our sample.\nThe error bars show the statistical uncertainties evaluated from a bootstrap resampling\nmethod with a series of 500 Monte Carlo simulations. We fit the LF by a usual Schechter\nparameterization and list the best-fit parameters in Table 3.\nThe derived K \u2032 LFs at 0.6 < z \u2264 1.0 differ slightly from the local one, having hints of a\nsteeper faint-end slope and brighter bright end, though the overall shape of the LF seem to\nagree with that of local K \u2032 -band LF taking account the normalization difference. The most\nstriking result perceived from this figure is that the K \u2032 -band LF remains almost unchanged\nfrom z = 0.6(0.0) to z = 2.5 and shows decline at the bright end at 2.5 < z \u2264 3.5. We have\nevaluated the robustness of our resulted LFs against the errors of our photometry and the\nphotometric redshift estimate by the Monte Carlo realizations, which is as the same as those\nwe performed in \u00a73. The evaluated 1\u03c3 scatter of derived LF parameters, i.e., \u03b1, M \u2217 , and \u03c6\u2217\nare denoted in Table 3. We found that the effects of photometric and redshift errors are small\nwith negligible effect on \u03b1, and at most 0.5mag in M \u2217 . The K \u2032 -band LF at 2.5 < z \u2264 3.5\nalso has signs of a steeper faint end slope than that at lower z ones, which is expected in\nthe context of the hierarchical clustering model. However, the trend may not be statistically\nsignificant because of the lack of enough sample objects in faint (MK \u2032 > \u221221) bins.\nCowie et al. (1996) have derived the rest K \u2032 -band LF for 0.6 < z < 1.0 galaxies. It\nremains almost unchanged from that for 0 < z < 0.2. Drory et al. (2001) also showed no\nsignificant evolution of rest K \u2032 -band LF for z < 1.2. Lilly et al. (1995) have also noted that\nrest-frame red luminosity galaxies have a weak evolution up to z = 1. This trend has been\nfound to continue up to z . 3 in this study. The almost no evolution in the rest K \u2032 -band LF\nimplies that the old stellar population in galaxies was already in place by z = 2 \u2212 3 and that\ntheir stellar mass did not change significantly at 0 < z < 3. It seems that the present result\nis inconsistent with the hierarchical clustering model. Papovich, Dickinson, & Ferguson\n(2002) estimated the stellar masses for the HDF-N galaxies by using population-synthesis\nmodels and found that massive present-day galaxies were not fully assembled by z \u223c 2.5\nas predicted by the hierarchical galaxy formation model, which might be also inconsistent\nwith ours. However, Drory et al. (2001) have shown that the M/LK slightly decreases with\nredshift at z < 1.2. If this trend continues up to z \u223c 2.5, all the findings are consistent\nwith the fact that the number density of K \u2032 band luminosity-selected galaxies does not\nremarkably change with redshift, while the number density of stellar mass-selected galaxies\ndecreases with look-back time.\nIt should be noted that we are assuming here a rather large extrapolation along the SED\ntemplate from the observed K \u2032 -band to the rest K \u2032 -band especially at 2.5 < z \u2264 3.5. The\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nreliability of this extrapolation depends on some appropriate assumptions in constructing\nthe SED templates, based on our fundamental knowledge of star formation histories in a\ngalaxy. Recently, Shapley et al. (2001) and Papovich, Dickinson, & Ferguson (2002) have\nattempted to derive the stellar masses for individual sample of Lyman break galaxies at\nz \u223c 3. In these studies, their UV to near-IR photometries were fitted with a series of stellar\npopulation synthesis models, which is basically the same SED-fitting method as photometric\nredshift except that they considered carefully almost full allowable range of various input\nparameters in constructing SED templates. This constraint method can be applied only\nto the samples whose redshifts are reliably determined by spectroscopy. Although some\ninteresting trends have been found among parameters of star formation histories, they found\nonly loose constraints on each of the parameters including stellar masses. This means that\nthe stellar mass measurement even at observed K \u2032 band at z \u223c 3 has some uncertainty.\nThe most significant uncertainty factor in deriving stellar mass is a second stellar population\ncomponent (Papovich, Dickinson, & Ferguson 2002) of old stars that have formed in a\nburst that occurred before ongoing active star formation. The stellar masses with this twocomponent model are estimated to be 3 \u2212 8 times of that of the single-component models.\nWhile this old population, if any, actually influences on the estimate of stellar masses, its\nallowable flux contribution is supposed to be small because of its high mass-to-light ratio.\nFor example in Figure 19 of Papovich, Dickinson, & Ferguson (2002), which shows the effect\nof a second old stellar population on the galaxy SED, the second component increases the\ninferred rest K \u2032 -band luminosity by a factor of less than \u223c 1.4, which corresponds to \u223c 0.37\nmag brightening. As a consequence, our extrapolation of SED and derived rest K \u2032 -band\nmagnitudes at high z in this study could have uncertainty to the same extent.\nIn the following subsections, we will see the evolution of rest-frame LFs of bluer rest\nbands that trace young stellar population and are sensitive to star formation activity.\n\n4.2.\n\nRest B Frame Luminosity Function\n\nWe have also estimated the rest B-band luminosity functions with almost the same\nkind of K \u2032 LF. Six objects out of 439 in the K \u2032 -selected sample were not detected in the\nB-band image. We have derived their inferred B-band magnitudes from their best-fit SED\ntemplates, convolved with a B-band response curve. The consistency between photometric\nB-band magnitudes and these inferred B magnitudes from their best-fit SEDs were checked\nwith sample galaxies except these six B-dropout galaxies, and their agreement was found to\nbe within 0.56 mag rms. The inferred B magnitudes of the six B dropout galaxies were all\nbeyond the 1\u03c3 limiting magnitude 29.76 of the B-band image.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nThe rest B-band LFs at 0.6 < z \u2264 3.5 are shown in Figure 6, and the best-fit Schechter\nparameters are listed in Table 3. Superposed dotted lines are the local B-band LFs from\nthe SDSS (Blanton et al. 2001) converted from g \u2217 -band. In the 0.6 < z \u2264 1.0 bin panel, we\nalso superposed as a dashed line the 0.75 < z < 1.0 rest B-band LF derived in the CFRS\n(Lilly et al. 1995) for the \u03a9m = 1, \u03a9\u03bb = 0, and h = 0.75 case. Although CFRS samples only\nthe bright end of the LF, the agreement between CFRS and our result for 0.6 < z \u2264 1.0\nis quite good, both show the brightening by 0.5 mag from the local rest B LF. Note that\nCFRS is the I-band magnitude-limited sample and ours is K \u2032 -band limited, though both of\nthese bands trace above 4000\u00c5 at z < 1.0.\nIn the 2.5 < z \u2264 3.5 panel of Figure 6, the dashed line represents the rest V -band LF\nof Lyman-break galaxies at z \u223c 3 by Shapley et al. (2001). We have converted their rest\nV -band magnitude to our rest B-band magnitude by using the rough estimate of average\ncolor of observed (H \u2212 K) \u223c 0.40, which approximately corresponds to the rest (B \u2212 V ),\nat z \u223c 3 derived on HDF-N galaxies by Papovich, Dickinson, & Ferguson (2002). We have\nalso reestimated the MV\u2217 and \u03c6\u2217 values assuming a cosmology with \u03a9m = 1.0 and h = 0.7.\nThough band conversion has some uncertainty (\u223c \u00b10.5), our rest B LF at z \u223c 3 is in good\nagreement with that of Shapley et al. (2001) which is part of the rest UV spectroscopically\nselected sample of Steidel et al. (1999). The agreement of LFs at z \u223c 3 of our K \u2032 -selected and\ntheir optically selected samples means that there are very few, if any, red candidates of old\nnon-star-forming galaxies that would not be detected in optical bands but in near-infrared\nbands, which is also suggested by Shapley et al. (2001) and Papovich, Dickinson, & Ferguson\n(2002). On the contrary, we can conclude that our K \u2032 -selected sample does not have a large\ndeficit of young blue star-forming galaxies at least in brighter magnitudes.\nIn contrast to the rest K \u2032 LF, the rest B LF shows brightning with epoch up to z < 2.5.\nThe bright end of the LF appears to continue brightening by 0.4mag from 0.6 < z \u2264 1.0\nto 1.0 < z \u2264 1.5, and by a further 0.4mag from 1.0 < z \u2264 1.5 to 1.5 < z \u2264 2.5, keeping\nthe faint-end slope constant, though its brightening degree is within the M \u2217 error caused by\nphotometric and redshift errors. The bright-end amplitude of the rest B LF at 1.5 < z \u2264 2.5\nclearly exceeds over the local B-band LF, while it declines at 2.5 < z \u2264 3.5 almost to the\nlocal amplitude.\nThis brightening evolution in rest B LF is also seen in Sawicki, Lin & Yee (1997) for\nthe HDF F814WAB < 27 sample. They have found not only the brightening but also the\nsteepening of the faint end slope with increasing redshift to z = 3. The difference in faintend slope is presumably caused by the difference of the observed band used to construct the\nmagnitude-limited sample, which will be discussed later.\nIn the rest B band, we have found a strong luminosity evolution at z < 3 which was not\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nseen in the rest K \u2032 band. In next subsection, we further investigate this trend in the bluer\nUV band, which directly relates to the star formation rate of a galaxy.\n\n4.3.\n\nRest UV 2000\u00c5 Frame Luminosity Function\n\nWe derive the rest UV LF at 2000\u00c5 for which Sullivan et al. (2000) have derived the\nlocal LF for an ultraviolet selected sample. We have evaluated photometric redshifts, as\nwell as best-fit SEDs, for all the galaxies in our K \u2032 -selected sample. Therefore we can\nderive absolute magnitudes of any rest wavelength in the AB system, although the derived\nmagnitudes would suffer directly the error of the photometric redshift evaluation. Here we\nderive the absolute magnitude, M2000 as follows,\nM2000 = mAB + 2.5log(1 + z) \u2212 5log(dL (z)/10pc),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere mAB is the observed redshifted magnitude at 2000(1 + z)\u00c5 and dL (z) is the\nluminosity distance. It is to be noted that the derived rest UV luminosity is uncorrected\nfor dust extinction, which is estimated to be in the range of A1700 = 0.0 \u2212 4.0mag at z \u223c 3\n(Papovich, Dickinson, & Ferguson 2002).\nThe rest 2000\u00c5 LFs at 0.6 < z \u2264 3.5 are represented in Figure 7 and best-fit Schechter\nparameters are again listed in Table 3. Superposed dotted lines are the local rest 2000\u00c5 LF\n(Sullivan et al. 2000) for h = 0.75 converted to AB system by a 2.29 mag offset (Cowie,\nSongaila, & Barger 1999). As was seen in the rest B band LF, the rest 2000\u00c5 LFs also\nshow a luminosity evolution that is stronger than in the rest B LF and continues up to\n\u2217\n2.5 < z < 3.5 bin. The M2000\nvalue is getting luminous from z = 0.6 to z = 3.5 over 1 mag,\n\u2217\nwhich is more significant than M2000\nerrors.\nCowie, Songaila, & Barger (1999) have derived the rest 2000\u00c5 LF at 0.5 < z < 0.9 and\n1.0 < z < 1.5. We represent their LFs in the case of \u03b1 = \u22121.0 and h = 0.75 as dashed line\nin corresponding redshift bins of Figure 7. They mentioned that their value of ultraviolet\nluminosity density, which is lower than that of other studies, would partly be caused by field\nvariation. Taking account of this normalization fluctuation, as well as their fairly large error\nof \u00b10.4mag in determination of M \u2217 , our results agree with their LFs.\nFor 2.5 < z \u2264 3.5 in Figure 7, the dashed line represents the rest 1700\u00c5 LF of Lymanbreak galaxies at hzi = 3.04 by Steidel et al. (1999). We ignore the rest-band difference\nbetween 2000 and 1700\u00c5 because the correction would be less than \u03b4M \u2243 0.13. Again as\nseen in the rest B LF, our estimate of the rest UV LF at z \u223c 3 is in good agreement with\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nthat of Steidel et al. (1999), who have estimated only the bright end (M1700 < \u221220).\nAs has been noticed in rest B band LF, we can see less faint galaxies at higher redshift\nin this rest UV LF. This is probably caused by the fact that our K \u2032 -limited sample is\ninsensitive to blue dwarf galaxies. The deficit of faint-end galaxies in the K-selected sample\nis also seen in local universe. The LFs of K-selected sample (e.g., Cole et al. 2001; Table 3)\nhave shallower faint-end slopes \u03b1 \u223c \u22121.0 than those of optical-selected sample (e.g., Blanton\net al. 2001), \u03b1 \u223c \u22121.20.\n\n5.\n\nEvolution of Rest UV-K \u2032 Color\n\nIn the previous section, concerned with rest-frame luminosity functions, we found the\nrest K \u2032 -band LF has almost no evolution, while the B- and the UV-band LFs show drastic\nluminosity evolution; that is, galaxies get brighter in bluer bands with increasing redshift. As\na natural consequence, galaxies are inferred to be getting bluer in rest frame with redshift.\nTo see this trend more definitely, we show the rest M2000 \u2212 MK \u2032 color evolution with redshift\nin Figure 8. The rest-frame 2000\u00c5 and K \u2032 luminosity of each galaxy selected in K \u2032 band can\nbe calculated with the same manner described above. Note that this color estimate is not\nbased on the same aperture magnitudes in 2000\u00c5 and K \u2032 bands. We categorized the sample\ngalaxies according to their absolute rest K \u2032 -band magnitudes, MK \u2032 , which are fairly good\nindicators of the stellar mass. We have mentioned in \u00a74.1 that MK \u2032 values derived from the\nextrapolation of SED template might be a poor proxy of stellar mass at z \u223c 3, as suggested\nby Shapley et al. (2001) and Papovich, Dickinson, & Ferguson (2002). Though predominant\nuncertainty caused by the second old population would increase the absolute stellar mass\nestimate systematically, the correlation between MK \u2032 and stellar mass would be maintained\nif all the galaxies at z \u223c 3 are assumed to have similar mass ratios of the young to old stellar\npopulations. It was found that the derived stellar masses have a fairly tight correlation\nwith extinction-uncorrected rest V luminosity (Shapley et al. 2001). Papovich, Dickinson,\n& Ferguson (2002) have also found the correlation even with the rest UV luminosity with a\nscatter of \u223c 0.3dex, though Shapley et al. (2001) have found only weak correlation. However,\nwe should note again that the extinction is still uncertain in the UV luminosity at z \u223c 3.\nIn Figure 8, the most massive MK \u2032 \u2264 \u221223.5 sample is represented by open circles. The\n\u221223.5 < MK \u2032 \u2264 \u221221.0 and \u221221.0 < MK \u2032 samples are represented by filled circles and\ncrosses, respectively. The median M2000 \u2212 MK \u2032 color for each redshift is traced by solid,\ndotted and dashed lines from the most massive sample to the least massive one, respectively.\nTwo significant trends can be seen in this figure. First, all three subsamples have a\nmild bluing trend in M2000 \u2212 MK \u2032 with increasing redshift as expected from our results on\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nrest LFs. For example, MK \u2032 \u2264 \u221223.5 sample has median color M2000 \u2212 MK \u2032 = 7.46 around\nz = 0.3, while at z = 2.7 there are no such red galaxies and median color becomes as blue\nas 4.73. The bluing trend we found has already been indicated by several studies (e.g.,\nCowie et al. 1996; Papovich, Dickinson, & Ferguson 2002) and is as qualitatively expected\nfrom a passive evolution model. Papovich, Dickinson, & Ferguson (2002) suggests that\nthe UV-optical rest-frame SEDs of the Lyman break galaxies at 2.0 . z . 3.5 are much\nbluer than those of present-day spiral and elliptical galaxies. The other two subsamples,\n\u221223.5 < MK \u2032 \u2264 \u221221.0 and \u221221.0 < MK \u2032 also show this bluing trend, at least at z < 1.5,\nand almost no color changes have been found beyond z = 1.5. Our sample is so small that\nwe cannot discriminate the difference of rapidity of this bluing trend among subsamples.\nIt should be noted that an observational limit might affect this diagram. It is difficult to\nshow explicitly the observational limit of K \u2032 \u2264 24.0 in this rest-frame plane. For simplicity,\nwe show in Figure 8 a fiducial line (heavy solid line) denoting the bluer color limit of a galaxy\nhaving constant luminosity of M2000 = \u221220, which can be observed in the K \u2032 -band image\n(K \u2032 \u2264 24.0), ignoring the small k\u2212correction (e.g., Mannucci et al. 2001) at the K \u2032 band.\nGalaxies brighter than M2000 = \u221220 would be detectable above this line. For a galaxy with\nM2000 = \u221219, you may shift the lower limit upward by 1mag. At higher redshift, it is found\nthat galaxies that are bluer and fainter in 2000\u00c5 are not likely to stay in this K \u2032 -limited\nsample. Our subsample of \u221223.5 < MK \u2264 \u221221.0 and \u221221.0 < MK would have been affected\nby this observational bias which may cause a lack of blue galaxies at high redshift if such\nblue population really exists. The blueing trend of these subsample seems to stop at z = 1.5\nin Figure 8, though it may be possibly attributed to this bias.\nOn the other hand, for MK \u2264 \u221223.5 subsample, which seems to be less affected by this\nbias, all the galaxies become redder with time in z < 1, while there are galaxies around\nz \u2243 1 as blue as those at z \u2243 3. It seems that the scatter of the color becomes larger\nin the nearby universe. The same trend can be seen in the rest-frame U \u2212 B color of\nthe brightest (MB < \u221220.3) galaxy sample in HDF by Dickinson (2000). These galaxies\nwith similar stellar masses keep their blue color throughout the passive evolution during a\nlonger timescale than the typical timescale of an intense starburst event. This implies that a\nmerging process (e.g., Lacey & Cole 1993) and subsequent star formation have been taking\nplace continuously during 1 . z . 3 epoch. These blue galaxies of MK \u2264 \u221223.5 at z = 1\nseem to be assembled from lower mass galaxies via. merging and are ongoing star formation.\nSecond, it is found that more massive galaxies tend to be redder in rest M2000 \u2212 MK \u2032\ncolor at every epoch. The median color of massive galaxies is always redder than that of less\nmassive galaxies. The trend that red galaxies are more luminous than blue ones has already\nbeen established in the local universe for example by Blanton et al. (2001), who found that\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\non average high surface brightness, red, and highly concentrated galaxies are more luminous\nthan low surface brightness, blue, and less concentrated galaxies. If rest M2000 \u2212 MK \u2032 color\nindicates the age of a galaxy, the massive galaxies tend to have older, which can be easily\ninferred from the context of downsizing hypothesis, in which massive (spheroidal) galaxies\nformed at high z, followed at later epochs by the formation of less massive galaxies.\n\n6.\n\nContribution to The Global Star Formation Rate Density\n\nIn the last few years, there have been great advances in understanding the evolution of\nthe global star formation rate density (SFRD). At low redshift between z = 0 and z = 1.5,\nthe SFRD is found to be steadily increasing with redshift. At high redshift, some results\n(e.g., Madau, Pozzetti, & Dickinson 1998) meet the SFRD peak around z \u223c 1.5, while others\n(e.g., Steidel et al. 1999) maintain it relatively constant. The estimate of SFRD based on\nthe ultraviolet luminosity of galaxies is strongly affected not only by dust obscuration, which\nmany investigators took into account but also by the faint end of the LF. At last in this\nstudy, we derive the SFRD based on our evaluated rest UV LF.\nThe SFRD can be estimated by integrating over the best-fit Schechter function to infinity\nfor the rest UV LF in each redshift bin. Equation (4) below was used to convert luminosity\nat 2000\u00c5, L2000 to an SFR based on the calibration given by Madau, Pozzetti, & Dickinson\n(1998) for a Salpeter IMF,\nSF R(M\u2299 yr\u22121 ) = 1.26 \u00d7 10\u221228 L2000 (ergs s\u22121 Hz\u22121 ).\n\n(4)\n\nThe result is represented in Figure 9, in which several previous estimates are also plotted.\nAll the previous results except Steidel et al. (1999) were derived by integrating the Schechter\nfunction to infinity. For consistency, we increased the Steidel et al. (1999) points by an\nadditional factor 1.7 as they have noted in the case of integration to infinity. We checked\nour data point by recalculating the SFRD from other rest UV wavelengths such as 1500 and\n2800\u00c5 as was adopted in previous studies and found that our SFRD estimate is stable within\na fluctuation of 0.2. The dust extinction is uncorrected for in all the estimates.\nOur results are denoted as solid circles and are broadly consistent with others at z <\n1.5, though they show slight deficiencies at z > 1.5, where there are yet no established\nobservations. This has probably arisen because our estimated rest UV LF of the K \u2032 -selected\nsample has a shallower faint-end slope than that of Steidel et al. (1999). For an example,\nif we change the LF slope at 2.5 < z \u2264 3.5 from \u03b1 = \u22120.83 to \u03b1 = \u22121.6 as Steidel et al.\n(1999) have adopted at z = 3, our estimate at z = 3 in Figure 9 shifts up to the open circle,\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nwhich is almost consistent with Steidel et al. (1999). Otherwise, if the slope of the rest UV\nLF at z = 3 is really as steep as \u03b1 = \u22121.6, our K \u2032 < 24.0 limited sample contributes only\n42% of the total UV luminosity density, that is, of the total star formation rate density at\nz = 3. The remaining 58% should be charged to faint galaxies with M2000 > \u221219 for which\nour sample seems to have a deficiency of galaxies compared with the LF derived by Steidel et\nal. (1999). These missed faint galaxies correspond to very blue galaxies, which are probably\naffected by the observational limit in K \u2032 band as has been shown in \u00a75. However, we should\nnote here that as they have mentioned the \u03b1 derived by Steidel et al. (1999) has a large\nuncertainty because it is determined only at the bright end (M1700 < \u221220) of the LF. Poli\net al. (2001) have estimated the photometric redshifts for I-selected galaxies and obtained a\nshallower faint end slope \u03b1 = \u22121.37 \u00b1 0.20 for the rest 1700\u00c5 LF of 2.5 < z \u2264 3.5 galaxies\ndown to M1700 = \u221219. The existence of a substantial population of such faint (M1700 > \u221220)\nand blue Lyman break galaxies at z > 3 is still questionable.\n\n7.\n\nSummary\n\nWe have constructed a very deep K \u2032 -selected multicolor BV RIz \u2032 JK \u2032 sample of field\ngalaxies on the Subaru Deep Field. Based on this multicolor data, a photometric redshift\nfor each sample galaxy was estimated. Our principal conclusions are the following:\n1. The overall N(z) distribution for the K \u2032 \u2264 21 sample is consistent with previous observations, and we for the first time derived the N(z) down to K \u2032 = 24. Taking account\nof dust extinction and selection effects of the sample, the observed N(z) distribution at\nthe most secure magnitude bin, 22 < K \u2032 \u2264 23, is well described with the PLE model,\nwhile a recent version of the hierarchical galaxy formation model shows an apparent\ndeficiency of galaxies, especially at z > 2. The PLE model with realitic dust evaluation\ncan account for the abundance of the high z (z > 2) galaxies. In the faintest bin of\nN(z), 23 < K \u2032 \u2264 24, both of the model predictions are found to be inconsistent with\nthe observations. The discrepancy in the faintest bin is presumably caused by the\nphotometric errors that give an incorrect solution of photometric redshifts.\n2. The rest K \u2032 , B, and UV(2000\u00c5) band luminosity functions and their evolution have\nbeen investigated. The rest K \u2032 -band luminosity function shows almost no evolution\nup to z = 3. The rest B luminosity function shows mild brightning with epoch up to\nz = 2.5, though its brightening degree is within the M \u2217 error caused by photometric\nand redshift errors. The rest 2000\u00c5 LFs also show a luminosity evolution that is more\n\u2217\nsignificant than in the rest B LF and continues up to z = 3.5. The M2000\nvalue is\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\ngetting luminous from z = 0.6 to z = 3.5 over 1 mag, which is more significant than\n\u2217\nM2000\nerrors.\n3. The evolutionary trend of rest luminosity functions appears to correspond to the bluing\ntrend of the rest UV \u2212 K \u2032 color with increasing redshift. We also found that more\nmassive galaxies are redder at every epoch.\n4. The findings about the evolution of rest luminosity functions are qualitatively in favor\nof the PLE model. The star formation activity in a galaxy changes the rest blue\nluminosity, while the amount of old stellar population does not change. The resulting\nrest K \u2032 -band luminosity function showing almost no evolution up to z = 2.5 can also\nbe consistent with the hierarchical galaxy formation model if M/LK decreases with\nredshift; that is, the number density of K \u2032 -band luminosity-selected galaxies does not\nsignificantly change with redshift, while the number density of stellar mass-selected\ngalaxies decreases with look-back time.\n5. We have evaluated the contribution to the cosmic star formation rate density of our\nK \u2032 -selected galaxies. The star formation rate density derived from integration of our\nrest UV luminosity function is about 42% of that derived from Lyman break galaxies\nat z = 3. The result suggests that a large fraction of global star formation rate density\nat z > 2 could represent the contribution of faint blue galaxy population, which has\nnot yet explicitly been identified in a high z universe.\nThough the present results rely heavily on an availability of photometric redshifts, we\nare confident that we have successfully derived a coherent picture of evolution of K \u2032 , B,\nand UV rest-frame luminosity functions over the range 0.6 < z \u2264 3.5 to the faint end\nbelow the limit of the today's spectroscopic studies. Our result raises the question of how\nsuch massive galaxies have formed at high redshift with efficient star formation, which is\napparently consistent with the PLE picture in the K band, within the framework of the\nstructure formation in the CDM universe. Of course, deeper NIR imaging surveys in future\nwill allow us to derive more secure results for N(z) at the faintest magnitude and on the faint\nend of the rest LFs, in which we have obtained robust results in this study. Deep observation\nat longer wavelength with SIRT F and AST RO-F will be also required to constraint the\nSEDs of galaxies at z > 3. The technique that we have adopted in this study will be applied\nto future wide-field K-band surveys to determine the rest luminosity at any wavelength at\nany redshift down to the faintest magnitude. On the other hand, ongoing large multiobject\nspectroscopic surveys are of course extremely important to reveal the galaxy evolution more\nreliably.\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nWe deeply appreciate the devoted support of the Subaru Telescope staff for this project.\nWe thank the referee for helpful comments that improved the manuscript.

The median M2000 \u2212 MK \u2032 color\nfor each redshift is traced by solid, dotted and dashed lines from bright subsample to faint\nsubsample, respectively. We show a thick solid line as a fiducial line denoting the lower\n\u2032\ncolor limit corresponding to our sample's magnitude limit of Klim\n= 24.0 galaxy for constant\n\u2032\nM2000 = \u221220 ignoring the small k\u2212correction at K -band. Galaxies brighter than M2000 =\n\u221220 would be detectable above this line.
