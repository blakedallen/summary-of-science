Since\nthe underlying curved space generates a position-dependent kinetic energy, three different\nquantization prescriptions are worked out by imposing that the maximal superintegrability of the system has to be preserved after quantization.

These three approaches are used to illustrate different features of the quantization problem on N -dimensional curved spaces or, alternatively, of position-dependent\nmass quantum Hamiltonians. This quantum oscillator is, to the best of our knowledge,\nthe first example of a maximally superintegrable quantum system on an N -dimensional\nspace with nonconstant curvature.\n\nPACS: 03.65.-w 02.30.Ik 05.45.-a\nKEYWORDS: nonlinear, oscillator, superintegrability, deformation, hyperbolic, curvature,\nposition-dependent mass\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis paper is devoted to the study of the quantum mechanical version of N -dimensional\n(N D) classical Hamiltonian systems of the type\nH(q, p) = T (q, p) + U(q) =\n\np2\n+ U(q),\n2 M(q)\n\nwhere q, p \u2208 RN are conjugate coordinates and momenta with canonical Poisson bracket\n{qi , pj } = \u03b4ij . The physical interpretation of these systems is two-fold. On one hand, as\nthe Hamiltonian describing the motion of a particle on the N D curved space defined by the\n(conformally flat) metric ds2 = M(q) dq2 and under the action of the potential U(q). On\nthe other, as position-dependent mass systems on the N D Euclidean space.\nEvidently, the crucial point for the definition of the corresponding Schr\u00f6dinger problem\nis the consistent (under certain given criteria) definition of the quantum kinetic energy term,\nT (q, p) \u2192 T\u0302 (q\u0302, p\u0302), since an obvious ordering ambiguity appears when the position and\nmomenta operators are considered. In this paper we shall deal with a specific example: the\nmotion of a particle on the so-called N D Darboux III space [1, 2] given by M(q) = 1 + \u03bb q2\n(with \u03bb > 0), and whose potential will be the intrinsic oscillator on such space defined by\nU(q) =\n\n\u03c9 2 q2\n.\n2(1 + \u03bbq2 )\n\nThis choice is motivated by the fact that this system is the only known example of a\nmaximally superintegrable classical Hamiltonian on an N D space with nonconstant curvature [3], and it can be interpreted as a \u03bb-deformation of the flat isotropic oscillator, which is\nrecovered in the \u03bb \u2192 0 limit. In fact, it is well-known that the quantum superintegrability of\nthe N D flat isotropic oscillator is useful in order to obtain its exact solution by making use\nof the superabundance of quantum integrals of the motion [4]. Therefore, it seems natural to\nquantize the Darboux III oscillator in such a way that the maximal superintegrability of the\nsystem will be manifestly preserved under quantization; moreover, presumably in this way\nthis new N D nonlinear oscillator could be fully solved by mimicking the standard procedure\nfor the Euclidean oscillator.\nIn the sequel we will show that this is indeed the case. In fact, the superintegrability\nconstraint will be useful in order to analyse in detail several possible quantization prescriptions\namenable for N D spaces with nonconstant curvature, namely:\n\u2022 The so-called [5] direct \"Schr\u00f6dinger\" quantization\n\u0124 =\n\n\u0001\n1\n1\n\u03c9 2 q\u03022\np\u03022 +\n=\n\u2212 ~2 \u2206 + \u03c9 2 q2 ,\n2\n2\n2\n2(1 + \u03bbq\u0302 )\n2(1 + \u03bbq\u0302 )\n2(1 + \u03bbq )\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhich was the one used in [6] for this system, since it preserves the maximal superintegrability in a straightforward way due to the immediate quantum transcription of the\n(2N \u2212 1) classical integrals of the motion. This property leads to a maximal degeneracy\nof the spectrum, which is exactly the same as in the quantum N D flat oscillator.\n\n2\n\n\f\u2022 The \"Laplace\u2013Beltrami\" (LB) quantization, which makes use of the usual LB operator\non curved spaces:\n\u0124LB = \u2212\n\n~2\n\u03c9 2 q2\n\u2206LB +\n2\n2(1 + \u03bbq2 )\n\nwhere\n\n\u2206LB =\n\nN\nX\n1 \u221a\n\u221a \u2202i gg ij \u2202j .\ng\n\n(1.2)\n\ni,j=1\n\nHowever, we shall show that this LB Hamiltonian cannot be transformed into (1.1)\nthrough a similarity transformation unless we include an additional quantum potential\nwhich is proportional to the scalar curvature of the underlying space. This similarity\ntransformation guarantees that the spectra of (1.2) and (1.1) coincide, and provides\nthe explicit form of the full set of quantum integrals for \u0124LB . We stress that such a\nkind of quantum \"geometric\" potential is well-known in the literature (both in scalar\nfield theories in General Relativity as well as in the context of the quantization problem on generic Riemannian manifolds [7, 8, 9]), and it is tantamount to replace the\nLB operator by the so-called \"conformal Laplacian\" [10]. We have to mention here\nthat the connection between LB operators and scalar curvatures associated with two\ndifferent, possibly conformally flat, Riemannian manifolds has been firstly pointed out\nin a pioneering paper by Paneitz in 1983 [11]. However, the neat connection of the\nlatter with quantum superintegrability properties is here stated for the first time and\nwe think that this result opens the path for a novel algebraic approach to the subject.\n\u2022 Finally, a \"position-dependent mass\" (PDM) quantization, which is essential in many\ncondensed matter problems (see for instance [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]). Here we perform\nit by considering the symmetric prescription proposed in [15], namely:\n\u0124PDM (q\u0302, p\u0302) =\n\n1\n1\n\u03c9 2 q\u03022\n~2\n1\n\u03c9 2 q2\np\u0302*\np\u0302+\n=\n\u2212\n\u2207*\n\u2207+\n. (1.3)\n2 (1 + \u03bbq\u03022 )\n2(1 + \u03bbq\u03022 )\n2\n(1 + \u03bbq2 )\n2(1 + \u03bbq2 )\n\nIn this case we again find that, in order to get a similarity transformation leading to\n(1.1), another additional quantum potential has to be added to (1.3). In this way the\nspectrum is preserved and the full set of quantum integrals of the motion is explicitly\nobtained.\nWe stress that although the three previous quantum Hamiltonians have different explicit\nexpressions and, to some extent, interpretations, all of them are related through similarity\ntransformations provided the additional quantum potential terms are considered. This, in\nturn, means that they share a common energy spectrum, but they have different wave functions. Moreover, one of the main objectives of this comparative analysis is to point out some\ngeneric (i.e. potential independent) features of the quantization problem on curved spaces,\nsuch as the relevance of the dimension N of the underlying manifold (the N = 2 case will be\ndistinguished) as well as the particular properties of the nonconstant curvature cases.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In the next Section, the classical Darboux III oscillator\nis revisited in order to provide the necessary classical background on this system, including\nthe explicit description of its maximal superintegrability in terms of a curved Fradkin tensor.\nSection 3 is devoted to review the geometry of the underlying space, emphasizing the role\nof its nonconstant curvature and introducing a classical radial effective potential that will\nbe useful in the quantum context. In Section 4 the three superintegrable quantizations of\n3\n\n\fthe Darboux III oscillator are obtained, and the similarity transformations among them\nare fully described. Section 5 provides the three associated radial Schr\u00f6dinger equations.\nThe spectrum and eigenfunctions of the system are rigorously obtained in Section 6, thus\ncompleting the preliminary results given in [6]. Finally, Section 7 includes several remarks\nand open problems.\n\n2\n\nThe Darboux III oscillator\n\nThe N D classical Hamiltonian system given by\nH(q, p) =\n\np2 + \u03c9 2 q 2\n,\n\u03ba + q2\n\n(2.1)\n\nwith real parameters \u03ba > 0 and \u03c9 \u2265 0, was proven in [3] to be maximally superintegrable\n(MS), since this Hamiltonian is endowed with the maximum possible number of 2N \u2212 1\nfunctionally independent constants of motion. Hereafter we shall consider the equivalent\nHamiltonian H defined by H = \u03baH/2 with real parameter \u03bb = 1/\u03ba > 0:\nH(q, p) = T (q, p) + U(q) =\n\np2\n\u03c9 2 q2\n+\n.\n2(1 + \u03bbq2 ) 2(1 + \u03bbq2 )\n\n(2.2)\n\nThe kinetic energy T (q, p) can be interpreted as the one generating the geodesic motion\nof a particle with unit mass on a conformally flat space with metric and (nonconstant) scalar\ncurvature given by\n\u0001\n(N \u2212 1) 2N + 3(N \u2212 2)\u03bbq2\n2\n2\n2\n.\n(2.3)\nds = (1 + \u03bbq )dq ,\nR(q) = \u2212\u03bb\n(1 + \u03bbq2 )3\nIn fact, such a curved space is the N D spherically symmetric generalization of the Darboux\nsurface of type III [18, 19], which was constructed in [1, 2]. On the other hand, the central\npotential U was proven in [2, 3] to be an \"intrinsic\" oscillator potential on that Darboux\nspace.\nMoreover, in spite of the very naive appearance of the classical Hamiltonian (2.2), which\nis nothing but the N D isotropic harmonic oscillator system divided by its oscillator potential\n(plus a rather relevant constant here scaled to 1), it is worth mentioning that this system can\nalso be considered in three other different (but related) frameworks:\n\u2022 For N = 3, H arises as a particular case of the so call multifold (or \u03bd-fold) Kepler 3D\nHamiltonians constructed in [5, 20] as generalizations of the MIC\u2013Kepler and TaubNUT systems [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. In the notation of [20], H can be\nrecovered by setting \u03bd = 1/2, a = 1 and b = \u03bb. Notice that from our approach, the\nproper Kepler\u2013Coulomb potential on the Darboux space (2.3) would be [2]\np\np\n1 + \u03bbq2\nUKC = \u03b1\n,\n|q| = q2 ,\n\u03b1 \u2208 R,\n|q|\n\u22122\nwhich is related with the curved oscillator potential through U \u221d UKC\n.\n\n4\n\n\f\u2022 Again for N = 3, the potential U can be obtained from the temporal part of the\nfamily of the so called Bertrand metrics [30, 31] on (3 + 1)D Lorentzian spacetimes with\nnonconstant curvature. Such (3 + 1)D free systems possess stable circular orbits and\nall of their bounded trajectories are periodic, so these are the natural generalization of\nthe classical Bertrand's theorem [32] to spaces of nonconstant curvature. We recall that\nthe MS property for of all 3D Bertrand Hamiltonians, which come from the (3 + 1)D\nBertrand metrics, was recently proven in [33] (see also [34]).\n\u2022 As we have already mentioned, H can alternatively be interpreted as describing a PDM\nsystem in which the conformal factor of the metric (2.3) is identified with the mass\nfunction, which in this case is parabolic: M(q) = 1 + \u03bbq2 .\nWe point out that we have chosen to deal with (2.2) instead of (2.1) because in this way\nall the expressions that we shall present throughout the paper will have a smooth and well\ndefined limit \u03bb \u2192 0 that leads to the well-known results concerning the (flat) N D isotropic\nharmonic oscillator with frequency \u03c9. In particular, the limit \u03bb \u2192 0 of (2.2) and (2.3) yields\n1\n1\nH0 = p2 + \u03c9 2 q2 ,\n2\n2\n\n2.1\n\nds2 = dq2 ,\n\nR = 0.\n\n(2.4)\n\nMaximal superintegrability from a curved Fradkin tensor\n\nThe fact that H is a MS Hamiltonian can be explicitly demonstrated as follows [3, 35].\nTheorem 1. (i) The Hamiltonian H (2.2) is endowed with the following constants of motion.\n\u2022 (2N \u2212 3) angular momentum integrals:\nX\nX\nC (m) =\n(qi pj \u2212 qj pi )2 ,\nC(m) =\n(qi pj \u2212 qj pi )2 ,\n(2.5)\nN \u2212m<i<j\u2264N\n\n1\u2264i<j\u2264m\n\nwhere m = 2, . . . , N and C (N ) = C(N ) .\n\u2022 N 2 integrals which form the ND curved Fradkin tensor:\n\u0001\nIij = pi pj \u2212 2\u03bbH(q, p) \u2212 \u03c9 2 qi qj ,\nwhere i, j = 1, . . . , N and such that H =\n\n1\n2\n\n(2.6)\n\nPN\n\ni=1 Iii .\n\n{H, C (m) },\n\n(ii) Each of the three sets\n{H, C(m) } (m = 2, . . . , N ) and {Iii } (i = 1, . . . , N ) is\nformed by N functionally independent functions in involution.\n(iii) The set {H, C (m) , C(m) , Iii } for m = 2, . . . , N with a fixed index i is constituted by 2N \u22121\nfunctionally independent functions.\nNotice that the first set of 2N \u2212 3 integrals (2.5) is the same for any central potential on\nany spherically symmetric space [2] since it is provided by an underlying sl(2, R) coalgebra\nsymmetry (also by an so(N )-symmetry), while the second one (2.6) comes from the specific\noscillator potential that we consider here. The latter, in fact, correspond to a curved analog\nof the Fradkin tensor of integrals of motion [4] for the isotropic harmonic oscillator. We also\nrecall that the Hamiltonian (2.2) together with both sets of integrals of (2.5) and (2.6) can\n5\n\n\falternatively be obtained [35] from the free Euclidean motion by means of a St\u00e4ckel transform\nor coupling constant metamorphosis (see [36, 37, 38, 39] and references therein).\nThus, in general, the latter integrals (2.6) do not exist for a generic central potential so\nthat, in principle, the MS property is not ensured at all. From this viewpoint the N D nonlinear oscillator Hamiltonian H (2.2) can be regarded as the \"closest neighbour\" of nonconstant\ncurvature to the isotropic harmonic oscillator system (2.4) (with \u03bb = 0) as both share the\nsame MS property. In fact, the real parameter \u03bb behaves as a \"deformation\" parameter\ngoverning the nonlinear behaviour of H, and this parameter is deeply related to the variable\ncurvature of the underlying Darboux space.\n\n2.2\n\nExpressions in terms of hyperspherical coordinates in phase space\n\nThe above results can also be expressed in terms of hyperspherical coordinates r, \u03b8j , and\ncanonical momenta pr , p\u03b8j , (j = 1, . . . , N \u2212 1).

These are the N \u2212 1 angular equations\nC(2) (\u03b8N \u22121 , p\u03b8N \u22121 ) = p2\u03b8N \u22121 ,\nC(k) (\u03b8N \u2212k+1 , p\u03b8N \u2212k+1 ) = p2\u03b8N \u2212k+1 +\nC(N ) (\u03b81 , p\u03b81 ) = p2\u03b81 +\n\nC(N \u22121)\nsin2 \u03b81\n\nC(k\u22121)\nsin2 \u03b8N \u2212k+1\n\n,\n\nk = 3, . . . , N \u2212 1,\n\n\u2261 L2 ,\n\n(2.13)\n\ntogether with the single radial equation corresponding to the 1D Hamiltonian (2.12).\n\n3\n\nThe Darboux space and the classical effective potential\n\nThe underlying manifold of the classical Hamiltonian (2.2) is the N D Darboux space with\nmetric (2.3), whose kinetic energy corresponds to the geodesic motion on the complete Riemannian manifold MN = (RN , g) with\ngij := (1 + \u03bbq2 ) \u03b4ij ,\n\n(3.1)\n\nand provided that \u03bb > 0. The scalar curvature R(r) \u2261 R(|q|) (2.3) coming from this metric\nis always a negative increasing function such that limr\u2192\u221e R = 0 and it has a minimum at\nthe origin\nR(0) = \u22122\u03bbN (N \u2212 1),\nwhich is exactly the scalar curvature of the N D hyperbolic space with negative constant sectional curvature equal to \u22122\u03bb (see figure 1). Recall that the four Darboux surfaces are the only\n2D spaces of nonconstant curvature whose geodesic motion is (quadratically) MS, therefore\nthey are the \"closest\" ones to the classical Riemannian spaces of constant curvature [18, 19].\nAs far as the nonlinear radial oscillator potential U(r) (2.12) is concerned, we find that it\nis a positive increasing function of r, such that\nU(r) =\n\n\u03c92 r2\n,\n2(1 + \u03bbr2 )\n\nU(0) = 0,\n7\n\nlim U(r) =\n\nr\u2192\u221e\n\n\u03c92\n.\n2\u03bb\n\n(3.2)\n\n\fR\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nr\n\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-0.6\n-0.8\n-1.0\n-1.2\n\nFigure 1: Shape of the scalar curvature (2.3) of the Darboux space where r = |q| for N = 3\nand \u03bb = 0.1. The minimum is always located at the origin, and its value in this case is\nR(0) = \u22121.2.\n\nThis potential is shown in figure 2 for several values of \u03bb. Consequently, in contrast with\nthe (Euclidean) isotropic harmonic oscillator, U(r) yields a nonlinear behavior governed by\n\u03bb, which means that the oscillator potential has the asymptotic maximum \u03c9 2 /(2\u03bb).\nNevertheless, since the underlying manifold MN is not flat, the interplay between the\noscillator potential U(r) and the kinetic energy term is rather subtle. For this reason, the\ncomplete classical system can be better understood by introducing a classical effective potential. This can be achieved by applying the 1D canonical transformation defined by\n\u221a\npr\narcsinh( \u03bbr)\n1 p\n2\n\u221a\nP (r, pr ) = \u221a\n,\nQ(r) = r 1 + \u03bbr +\n,\n(3.3)\n2\n1 + \u03bbr2\n2 \u03bb\n(where the new canonical variables fulfill {Q, P } = 1), to the radial Hamiltonian (2.12).\nNotice that Q(r) has a unique (continuously differentiable)\ninverse r(Q), on the whole positive\n\u221a\nsemiline, that is, both r, Q \u2208 [0, \u221e) and dQ(r) = 1 + \u03bbr2 dr. In this way, we obtain that\n1\nH(Q, P ) = P 2 + Ueff (Q),\n2\n\nUeff (Q(r)) =\n\ncN\n\u03c92 r2\n+\n,\n2(1 + \u03bbr2 )r2\n2(1 + \u03bbr2 )\n\n(3.4)\n\nwhere the constant cN \u2265 0 is the value of the integral of motion corresponding to the square of\nthe total angular momentum C(N ) \u2261 L2 (2.13). Hence the classical system can be described\nas a particle on a 1D flat space under the effective potential Ueff (Q(r)), which is represented\nin figure 3.\nThe analysis of Ueff shows that this is always positive and it has a minimum located at\nrmin such that\nq\nq\n\u03bbcN + \u03bb2 c2N + \u03c9 2 cN\n2\nrmin =\n,\nUeff (Q(rmin )) = \u2212\u03bbcN + \u03bb2 c2N + \u03c9 2 cN .\n(3.5)\n\u03c92\n\n8\n\n\fU\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nr\n\nFigure 2: The nonlinear oscillator potential (3.2) with \u03c9 = 1 for \u03bb = {0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.1}\nstarting from the upper dashed line corresponding to the isotropic harmonic oscillator with\n\u03bb = 0.

The minimum of the potential is located at rmin = 3.49 with Ueff (rmin ) = 8.2\nand Ueff (\u221e) = 25. The dashed line corresponds to the effective potential of the harmonic\noscillator with \u03bb = 0 with minimum Ueff (rmin ) = 10 at rmin = 3.16.\n\n9\n\n\fTherefore, rmin and Ueff (Q(rmin )) are, in this order, greater and smaller than those corresponding to the isotropic harmonic oscillator:\n\u221a\ncN\n\u221a\n2\n\u03bb = 0 : rmin =\n,\nUeff (Q(rmin )) = \u03c9 cN .\n(3.6)\n\u03c9\nMoreover Ueff has two representative limits:\nlim Ueff (Q(r)) = +\u221e,\n\nlim Ueff (Q(r)) =\n\nr\u2192\u221e\n\nr\u21920\n\n\u03c92\n,\n2\u03bb\n\n(3.7)\n\nthe latter being the same of (3.2). Thus, this effective potential is hydrogen-like and one\nshould expect that its quantum counterpart should have both bounded and unbounded states.\nThe rest of the paper is devoted to solve such a quantum problem in full detail.\n\n4\n\nSuperintegrable quantizations of the Darboux III oscillator\n\nLet us consider the quantum position and momenta operators, q\u0302, p\u0302, with Lie brackets and\ndifferential representation given by\n[q\u0302i , p\u0302j ] = i~\u03b4ij ,\n\nq\u0302i = qi ,\n\np\u0302i = \u2212i~\n\n\u2202\n.\n\u2202qi\n\n(4.1)\n\nHereafter we will use the standard notation\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u22022\n\u22022\n\u2207=\n,...,\n,\n\u2206 = \u22072 = 2 + * * * + 2 .\n\u2202q1\n\u2202qN\n\u2202 q1\n\u2202 qN\n\n4.1\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger quantization\n\nThe so-called \"direct\" quantization approach can be summarized in the following way [6]\n(this result is worth to be compared with Theorem 1, but taking into account that hereafter\nthe order of the terms becomes crucial).\nTheorem 2.

Some points of this statement can be straightforwardly proven through the coalgebra\nsymmetry [40, 41, 42] of the quantum Hamiltonian (4.2). Let us consider the sl(2, R) Lie\ncoalgebra in the basis {J\u00b1 , J3 } with commutation rules, Casimir invariant and (nondeformed)\ncoproduct given by\n[J3 , J\u2212 ] = \u22122i~J\u2212 ,\n\n[J3 , J+ ] = 2i~J+ ,\n\n[J\u2212 , J+ ] = 4i~J3 ,\n\n1\nC = (J+ J\u2212 + J\u2212 J+ ) \u2212 J32 ,\n2\n\u2206(Jl ) = Jl \u2297 1 + 1 \u2297 Jl ,\nl = +, \u2212, 3.\n\n(4.6)\n(4.7)\n(4.8)\n\nAn N -particle realization of sl(2, R) reads\nJ+ = p\u03022 ,\n\nJ\u2212 = q\u03022 ,\n\n1\n1\nJ3 = (q\u0302 * p\u0302 + p\u0302 * q\u0302) = q\u0302 * p\u0302 \u2212 i~N.\n2\n2\n\n(4.9)\n\nTherefore, \u0124 (4.2) has an sl(2, R) coalgebra symmetry since it can be written as\n\u0124 =\n\n1\n\u03c9 2 J\u2212\nJ+ +\n.\n2(1 + \u03bbJ\u2212 )\n2(1 + \u03bbJ\u2212 )\n\n(4.10)\n\nHence, by construction, \u0124 commutes with the (2N \u2212 3) observables \u0108 (m) and \u0108(m) (m =\n2, . . . , N ) (4.3) which come from the \"left\" and \"right\" m-th coproducts [41, 42] of the\ninvariant (4.7), respectively, up to an additive constant ~2 m(m \u2212 4)/4. Furthermore, the\ncoalgebra approach also ensures that these are algebraically independent and that each set\n{\u0124, \u0108 (m) } and {\u0124, \u0108(m) } is formed by N commuting observables (to be more precise, they\nare polynomially independent as operators in a Jordan algebra).\nNext, by direct computations it can be proven that the N 2 observables I\u02c6ij (4.4) commute\nwith \u0124, and that the N (diagonal) observables I\u02c6ii (i = 1, . . . , N ) commute amongst themselves as well; it is obvious that the latter I\u02c6ii are algebraically independent. Finally, it is\nalso clear that any single I\u02c6ii is algebraically independent with respect to the set of 2N \u2212 2\nobservables {\u0124, \u0108 (m) , \u0108(m) } (as it is when \u03bb = 0) \u0003.\nWe stress that, as a byproduct of the above proof, any quantum Hamiltonian defined as\na function of (4.9),\n\u0124 = \u0124(J+ , J\u2212 , J3 ) = \u0124(p\u03022 , q\u03022 , q\u0302 * p\u0302 \u2212 i~N/2),\n\n(4.11)\n\nis endowed with the same sl(2, R) coalgebra symmetry. This shows that this is quasi-MS [2,\n41, 42], that is, it commutes, at least, with the (2N \u2212 3) observables \u0108 (m) and \u0108(m) . In this\n11\n\n\frespect, we remark that what makes the quantum Darboux III oscillator (4.10) very special,\nis the existence of a quantum Fradkin tensor formed by the \"additional\" symmetries I\u02c6ij . This\nalgebraic property implies that the system is MS and, as we shall see, that its discrete energy\nspectrum is maximally degenerate.\n\n4.2\n\nThe Laplace\u2013Beltrami quantization\n\nWhen dealing with curved spaces with metric and classical kinetic term given by\n2\n\nds =\n\nN\nX\n\ngij (q)dqi dqj ,\n\ni,j=1\n\nN\n1 X ij\nT (q, p) =\ng (q)pi pj ,\n2\ni,j=1\n\nthe LB operator\n\u2206LB =\n\nN\nX\n1 \u221a\n\u221a \u2202i gg ij \u2202j ,\ng\n\ni,j=1\n\ncan be used in order to define the quantum kinetic energy as\nT\u0302LB (q\u0302, p\u0302) = \u2212\n\n~2\n\u2206LB ,\n2\n\nwhere g ij is the inverse of the metric tensor gij and g is its determinant (see, for instance, [19,\n43]). If we apply such LB quantization to the Hamiltonian (2.2) with metric tensor (3.1) we\nget\n~2\n\u03c9 2 q2\n\u2206LB +\n2\n2(1 + \u03bbq2 )\n~2\n~2 \u03bb(N \u2212 2)\n\u03c9 2 q2\n=\u2212\n\u2206\n\u2212\n(q\n*\n\u2207)\n+\n.\n2(1 + \u03bbq2 )\n2(1 + \u03bbq2 )2\n2(1 + \u03bbq2 )\n\n\u0124LB = \u2212\n\nThen, \u0124 (4.2) and \u0124LB only coincide in the case N = 2 (as it should be for any sperically\nsymmetric space [39]) and for N > 2 they differ by a momentum-dependent potential, namely:\n\u0124LB = \u0124 + U1 ,\n\nU1 (q\u0302, p\u0302) = \u2212i\n\n~\u03bb(N \u2212 2)\n(q\u0302 * p\u0302),\n2(1 + \u03bbq\u03022 )2\n\nwhere we have introduced the quantum variables (4.1). Notice that U1 is linear in ~, so this\nterm does not have any classical analog. This situation reminds what happens in the context\nof the so-called quasi-exactly solvable quantum models [44]. On the other hand, although the\nHamiltonian \u0124LB commutes with the operators (4.3) (the quantum correction U1 preserves\nthe sl(2, R) coalgebra symmetry (4.6)\u2013(4.9)), in this case there is no hint about the existence\nof an additional symmetry of the type (4.4).\nNevertheless, it is possible to find a \"superintegrable\" LB quantization (in the sense that\nit does preserve the MS property) by adding a second potential term to \u0124 (besides U1 ) thus\nconveying N 2 additional integrals of the type (4.4) together with the separability property\n\n12\n\n\fin terms of the N \"diagonal\" ones. In order to achieve this result we will relate \u0124 and \u0124LB\nthrough a similarity transformation.

We remark that either\nfor N = 2 or when \u03bb = 0, f (q) = U2 (q) = 0, and notice also that the central potential\nU2 is a pure quantum term as it depends on ~2 . The latter result suggests to consider a\n\"transformed-LB\" Hamiltonian defined by\n\u0124TLB = \u0124LB + U2 = \u0124 + U1 + U2 ,\n\n(4.14)\n\n\u0124TLB = ef \u0124e\u2212f .\n\n(4.15)\n\nwhich satisfies\nHence, as a direct consequence, all the symmetries of \u0124 give rise to those corresponding to\n\u0124TLB :\nX\u0302TLB = ef X\u0302e\u2212f ,\nX\u0302 = {\u0108 (m) , \u0108(m) , I\u02c6ij },\n[\u0124TLB , X\u0302TLB ] = 0.\n(4.16)\nTherefore, by taking into account Theorem 2 and the equations (4.15) and (4.16) we find\nthat \u0124TLB is, in fact, a quantum MS Hamiltonian.\nTheorem 3.

Clearly, the eigenfunctions of \u0124TLB can be read off from\nthose of \u0124 by means of (4.15).\nRemark. Interestingly, the quantum correction U2 (4.13) to the oscillator potential arising from the similarity transformation (4.12) is proportional to the scalar curvature of the\nunderlying metric (2.3):\n~2 (N \u2212 2)\nU2 =\nR,\n8(N \u2212 1)\nwhich vanishes for any 2D space and in the (most frequently studied) case of spaces of constant\ncurvature gives simply an additional constant. Therefore, the transformed-LB quantization\nprescription is equivalent to imposing that\n~2\n\u2206c + U(q) ,\n2\nthat is, to asserting that the appropriate quantum kinetic energy operator is essentially the\nconformal Laplacian (see, for instance, [10])\n\u0124TLB = \u2212\n\n\u2206c = \u2206LB \u2212\n\n(N \u2212 2)\nR,\n4(N \u2212 1)\n\nrather than the ordinary Laplacian (or LB operator). This is in full agreement with many\nprescriptions used in the analysis of scalar field theories in General Relativity or when dealing\nwith quantization on arbitrary Riemannian manifolds [7, 8, 9]. However, we are not aware\nof any other instances where the convenience of this prescription has been motivated by\nsuperintegrability arguments.\n14\n\n\f4.3\n\nA position-dependent mass quantization\n\nIn the framework of PDM Hamiltonian systems there are also several ways to define the\nquantum kinetic energy term. A general approach depending on three parameters subjected\nto a constraint can be found in [14] (see also [16]). We shall consider here the proposal given\nin [15] and based on Galilean invariance arguments, which is the one extensively used in the\ncondensed matter literature [12, 13]. Such a PDM quantization, T (q, p) \u2192 T\u0302PDM (q\u0302, p\u0302), is\ndefined as\n1\n1\n~2\n1\nT\u0302PDM (q\u0302, p\u0302) = p\u0302 *\np\u0302 = \u2212 \u2207 *\n\u2207.\n2\n2\n(1 + \u03bbq\u0302 )\n2\n(1 + \u03bbq2 )\nThen, by adding the oscillator potential and ordering terms in the kinetic term, we obtain\nthe following PDM quantization of the Hamiltonian (2.2):\n\u0124PDM = T\u0302PDM (q\u0302, p\u0302) + U(q\u0302)\n~2 \u03bb\n\u03c9 2 q2\n~2\n\u2206\n+\n(q\n*\n\u2207)\n+\n.\n=\u2212\n2(1 + \u03bbq2 )\n(1 + \u03bbq2 )2\n2(1 + \u03bbq2 )\nHence the difference between \u0124 (4.2) and \u0124PDM relies again in a momentum-dependent\npotential,\n~\u03bb\n\u0124PDM = \u0124 + V1 ,\nV1 (q\u0302, p\u0302) = i\n(q\u0302 * p\u0302).\n(1 + \u03bbq\u03022 )2\nSimilarly to the LB quantization, the MS property can be explicitly restored through a\nsimilarity transformation and this process will require to add another central potential to the\ninitial \u0124PDM .\nExplicitly, if we apply \u0124PDM to the product exp(v(q))\u03a8(q) and define\nv(q) =\n\n1\nln(1 + \u03bbq2 ),\n2\n\nthen we get the following similarity transformation between \u0124 and \u0124PDM :\n\u0124PDM ev \u03a8 = ev (\u0124 \u2212 V2 (q))\u03a8,\n\u0124PDM = ev \u0124e\u2212v \u2212 V2 ,\n\u0001\n~2 \u03bb\nN + \u03bbq2 (N \u2212 3) .\nV2 (q) =\n2\n3\n2(1 + \u03bbq )\nHence, in contrast with the LB quantization, now both v(q) and V2 (q) are nontrivial for any\ndimension N (including N = 2). In this way, we define the following \"transformed-PDM\"\nHamiltonian,\n\u0124TPDM = \u0124PDM + V2 = \u0124 + V1 + V2 ,\n\n\u0124TPDM = ev \u0124e\u2212v ,\n\n(4.20)\n\nwhose symmetries are thus obtained from those of \u0124 as\nX\u0302TPDM = ev X\u0302e\u2212v ,\n\nX\u0302 = {\u0108 (m) , \u0108(m) , I\u02c6ij },\n\n[\u0124TPDM , X\u0302TPDM ] = 0.\n\n(4.21)\n\nThe MS property of the Hamiltonian \u0124TPDM is summarized in the following statement.\n\n15\n\n\fTheorem 4.

We recall that the results corresponding to the\nSchr\u00f6dinger quantization \u0124 (4.2) of Theorem 2 were advanced in [6] but without explicit\nproofs. Recall that both quantizations share the same spectrum but they have different\nradial wave functions which are related through the similarity transformation (5.11).\n\n6.1\n\nContinuous spectrum\n\nSince MN is a complete manifold and the potential is continuous and bounded, it is standard\nthat \u0124TLB is essentially self-adjoint on the space C0\u221e (RN ) of smooth functions of compact\nsupport. It should be remarked that one cannot immediately determine the continuous\nspectrum of \u0124TLB from asymptotics of the potential: in a complete Riemannian manifold,\neven the spectrum of the LB operator can be extremely difficult to analyze; e.g., it can be\neither purely continuous (as in Euclidean space), purely discrete [45] or consist of both a\ncontinuous part and eigenvalues, possibly embedded in the continuous spectrum [46].\nIn fact, to compute the continuous spectrum of \u0124TLB it is convenient to take advantage\nof the spherical symmetry to decompose\nM\nL2 (MN ) =\nL2 (R+ , d\u03bd) \u2297 Yl ,\n(6.1)\nl\u2208N\n\nwhere d\u03bd(r) = rN \u22121 (1 + \u03bbr2 )N/2 dr and Yl is the finite-dimensional space of (generalized)\nspherical harmonics, defined by\n\b\nYl := Y \u2208 L2 (SN \u22121 ) : \u2206SN \u22121 Y = \u2212l(l + N \u2212 2)Y ,\nwhere N stands for the set of nonnegative integers and \u2206SN \u22121 denotes the Laplacian on the\n(N \u2212 1)D sphere SN \u22121 (or minus the angular momentum operator). This decomposition is\ntantamount to setting\nX\n\u03a8TLB (q) =\nYl (\u03b8) \u03a6TLB,l (r) ,\nl\u2208N\n\nSN \u22121 ,\n\nwith \u03b8 = q/r \u2208\nr = |q| and Yl \u2208 Yl .\nAs \u0124TLB is spherically symmetric, the decomposition (6.1) allows us to write \u0124TLB as\nthe direct sum of operators\nM\n\u0124TLB =\n\u0124TLB,l \u2297 idYl ,\n(6.2)\nl\u2208N\n\nwith each \u0124TLB,l standing for the Friedrichs extension of the differential operator on L2 (R+ , d\u03bd);\nnamely\n2\u0124TLB,l = \u2212\n\n~2\nd N \u22121 d\n~2 \u03bb(N \u2212 2)r d\n~2 l(l + N \u2212 2)\nr\n\u2212\n+\nrN \u22121 (1 + \u03bbr2 ) dr\ndr\n(1 + \u03bbr2 )2 dr\nr2 (1 + \u03bbr2 )\n\u0001\n\u03c92 r2\n~2 \u03bb(N \u2212 2)\n+\n\u2212\n2N + 3\u03bbr2 (N \u2212 2) .\n2\n2\n3\n1 + \u03bbr\n4(1 + \u03bbr )\n19\n\n\fThe continuous spectrum of \u0124TLB is most easily dealt with using this decomposition. Indeed,\nfrom (6.2) it is apparent that\nspec(\u0124TLB ) =\n\n[\n\nspec(\u0124TLB,l ) .\n\nl\u2208N\n\nTo understand the spectrum of \u0124TLB,l we proceed to compute and analyze its associated\nquantum effective potential \u00dbeff,l . For this purpose we apply the same change of variable\nQ = Q(r) (3.3) used in the classical case, together with a change of the radial wave function\n\u03a6TLB,l (r) 7\u2192 u(Q(r)). We require that these transformations map the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\n\u0124TLB,l \u03a6TLB,l = E\u03a6TLB,l into\n\u0012 2 2\n\u0013\n~ d\n\u2212\n+ \u00dbeff,l (Q) u(Q) = Eu(Q).\n2 dQ2\n\n(6.3)\n\nThis is achieved by setting\n\u03a6TLB,l (r) =\n\nr(1\u2212N )/2\nu(r)\n(1 + \u03bbr2 )(N \u22121)/4\n\n(6.4)\n\nin the radial Schr\u00f6dinger equation, thus yielding\n!\n\u0001\n\u0012\n\u0013\n~2 8(1 + \u03bbr2 ) \u2212 5\n~2\nN (N \u2212 4)\n1\n+ 2 l(l + N \u2212 2) +\n+ \u03c92 r2 .\n\u00dbeff,l (r) =\n2(1 + \u03bbr2 )\n4r2 (1 + \u03bbr2 )2\nr\n4\n(6.5)\nThe behavior of \u00dbeff,l is rather similar to that of the classical effective potential (3.4) (see\nfigure 4), that is, \u00dbeff,l is a positive function with a unique minimum, whose expression is\nrather cumbersome and which for the harmonic oscillator reduces to\np\nl(l + N \u2212 2) + (N \u2212 1)(N \u2212 3)/4\n2\n,\n\u03bb=0:\nrmin = ~\n\u03c9\np\n\u00dbeff,l (rmin ) = ~\u03c9 l(l + N \u2212 2) + (N \u2212 1)(N \u2212 3)/4.\n(6.6)\nSimilarly to the classical system, the values of rmin and \u00dbeff,l (rmin ) are respectively greater\nand smaller than those corresponding to the quantum harmonic oscillator (6.6), but \u00dbeff,l has\nthe same asymptotic behaviour, namely,\nlim \u00dbeff,l (r) = +\u221e,\n\nlim \u00dbeff,l (r) =\n\nr\u2192\u221e\n\nr\u21920\n\n\u03c92\n.\n2\u03bb\n\n(6.7)\n\nWe remark that there is a single exceptional particular case for l = 0 and N = 2 for which\n\u00dbeff,l reads\n!\n\u0001\n\u2212~2 1 + 4\u03bb2 r4\n1\n2 2\n\u00dbeff,l (r) =\n+\u03c9 r .\n2(1 + \u03bbr2 )\n4r2 (1 + \u03bbr2 )2\nThus limr\u21920 \u00dbeff,l = \u2212\u221e and limr\u2192\u221e \u00dbeff,l = \u03c9 2 /(2\u03bb), so \u00dbeff,l has no minimum and can take\nboth negative and positive values.\n20\n\n\f\u00dbeff\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nr\n\n14\n\nFigure 4: The quantum effective nonlinear oscillator potential (6.5) for N = 3, \u03bb = 0.02,\nl = 10 and ~ = \u03c9 = 1. The minimum of the potential is located at rmin = 3.59 with\n\u00dbeff,l (rmin ) = 8.52 and \u00dbeff,l (\u221e) = 25. The dashed line corresponds to the quantum effective\npotential of the isotropic oscillator with \u03bb = 0 with minimum \u00dbeff,l (rmin ) = 10.49 at rmin =\n3.24.\nSince we have just related the nonnegative, self-adjoint second-order differential operator\non the half-line \u0124TLB,l to (6.3), standard results in spectral theory [47, Theorem XIII.7.66]\nensure that the eigenvalues of \u0124TLB,l are contained in (0, E\u221e ) and its continuous spectrum\nis absolutely continuous and given by [E\u221e , \u221e), where we have set\nE\u221e = lim \u00dbeff,l =\nr\u2192\u221e\n\n\u03c92\n.\n2\u03bb\n\nAltogether, this guarantees that the continuous spectrum of \u0124TLB is\n\u0002\n\u0001\nspeccont (\u0124TLB ) = \u03c9 2 /(2\u03bb), \u221e ,\nand that there are no embedded eigenvalues.\n\n6.2\n\nDiscrete spectrum and eigenfunctions\n\nLet us now compute the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of \u0124TLB . To begin with, let us denote\nby \u03c8n (q) the nth eigenfunction of the 1D harmonic oscillator which satisfies\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\n1\n1\n2 d\n2 2\n\u2212~\n+ \u03c9 q \u03c8n (q) = ~\u03c9 n +\n\u03c8n (q) .\n2\ndq 2\n2\nThe explicit expression of \u03c8n in terms of Hermite polynomials is\n\u0012r\n\u0013\n\u0010 \u03c9 \u0011\n\u03c9\n2\n\u03c8n (q) = exp \u2212 q Hn\nq ,\n2~\n~\n21\n\n(6.8)\n\n\fup to a normalization constant.\nDue to the relationship between the Schr\u00f6dinger and LB quantizations (4.15) we have\nthat \u03a8TLB (q) = (1 + \u03bbq2 )(2\u2212N )/4 \u03a8(q) and the eigenvalue equation\n\u0124TLB \u03a8TLB (q) = E\u03a8TLB (q)\ncan also be written as (see (4.2))\n(\u2212~2 \u2206 + \u03a92 q2 )\u03a8(q) = 2E\u03a8(q) ,\n\n(6.9)\n\nwhere\n\u03a9=\n\np\n\u03c9 2 \u2212 2\u03bbE.\n\n(6.10)\n\nSince \u0124TLB has no embedded eigenvalues (as shown in the previous subsection), one can\nsafely assume that \u03c9 2 \u2212 2\u03bbE > 0. The condition \u03a8TLB \u2208 L2 (MN ) translates, according to\n(4.5), as\nZ\n|\u03a8(q)|2 (1 + \u03bbq2 ) dq < \u221e ;\n\nin particular, \u03a8 is square-integrable with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Therefore, by the\nstandard theory of the harmonic oscillator, there must exist some n \u2208 N such that\n\u0012\n\u0013\nN\nE = ~\u03a9 n +\n.\n2\nSubstituting the formula for \u03a9, taking squares and isolating E, one readily finds that any\neigenvalue of \u0124TLB must be of the form\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u0012\n\u0013s\n\u0013\nN\nN 2\nN\nEn = \u2212\u03bb~2 n +\n~2 \u03bb2 n +\n+~ n+\n+ \u03c92\n2\n2\n2\n!\n\u00132 s\n\u0012\n2\n\u03c9\nN\n1+ 2 2\n\u22121 .\n(6.11)\n= \u03bb~2 n +\n2\n~ \u03bb (n + N2 )2\nConversely, one can prove that En is an eigenvalue of \u0124TLB for any n \u2208 N. This is easily seen\nby taking any partition (ni )N\ni=1 \u2282 N such that n1 + * * * + nN = n and noticing that, by (6.8)\nand (6.9),\nr\nN\nY\n\u03a9\n2 (2\u2212N )/4\n2 2\n\u03a8TLB (q) = (1 + \u03bbq )\nexp{\u2212\u03b2 qi /2}Hni (\u03b2qi ), \u03b2 =\n,\n(6.12)\n~\ni=1\n\nL2 (MN )\n\nis an\nsolution of the equation \u0124TLB \u03a8TLB = En \u03a8TLB .\nTogether with the result of the previous subsection, this proves the following\nTheorem 5. Let \u0124TLB be the quantum Hamiltonian (4.22). Then:\n2\n\n(i) The continuous spectrum of \u0124TLB is given by [ \u03c92\u03bb , \u221e). Moreover, there are no embedded\neigenvalues and its singular spectrum is empty.\n2\n(ii) \u0124TLB has an infinite number of eigenvalues, all of which are contained in (0, \u03c92\u03bb ). Their\n2\nonly accumulation point is \u03c92\u03bb , that is, the bottom of the continuous spectrum.\n(iii) All the eigenvalues of \u0124TLB are of the form (6.11), and \u03a8TLB is eigenfunction of \u0124TLB\nwith eigenvalue En if and only if it is given by a linear combination of the functions (6.12)\nwith ni \u2208 N and n1 + * * * + nN = n.\n22\n\n\fEn\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nn\n\nFigure 5: The discrete spectrum (6.11) for 0 \u2264 n \u2264 25, N = 3, ~ = \u03c9 = 1 and\n\u03bb = {0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04} starting from the upper dot line corresponding to the isotropic\nharmonic oscillator with \u03bb = 0; in the same order, E0 = {1.5, 1.48, 1.46, 1.41} and\nE\u221e = {\u221e, 50, 25, 12.5}.\nTherefore the bound states of this system satisfy\n\u03c92\n,\nlim (En+1 \u2212 En ) = 0.\nn\u2192\u221e\nn\u2192\u221e\n2\u03bb\nSuch a discrete spectrum is depicted in figure 5 for several values of \u03bb.\nE\u221e = lim En =\n\n7\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nSummarizing, we have presented a novel exactly solvable quantum nonlinear oscillator in\nN dimensions, that can be understood as a simultaneous \"analytic\" \u03bb-deformation of both\nthe usual isotropic oscillator potential and the underlying space on which the dynamics is\ndefined. It turns out that if both sides of the Hamiltonian (the manifold and the potential)\nare appropriately modified, the curved quantum system preserves all the superintegrability\nproperties of the Euclidean one, and its full solution can be explicitly obtained by making\nuse of the curved analogues of Fradkin operators. It is worth stressing that such an explicit\nsolution could be of interest from the physical viewpoint, since a parabolic effective-mass\nfunction has been proposed in [48, 49] in order to describe realistic quantum wells formed by\nsemiconductor heterostructures.\nOn the other hand, the quest for the preservation of superintegrability under quantization\nseems to be also a valuable guideline in order to clarify the properties of different possible\nquantization recipes on generic Riemannian manifolds. In this sense, we think that the\nconnection here presented between the conformal Laplacian approach and the MS property\nis worth to be investigated through, for instance, the study of the quantization of other MS\nsystems on spaces of nonconstant curvature that have been recently characterized in the\ncontext of the generalized Beltrami theorem [33].\n23\n\n\fFinally, we recall that the real parameter \u03bb = 1/\u03ba was restricted in [3] to take a positive\nvalue. However, the MS of the classical Hamiltonian stated in Theorem 1 does hold for\nnegative \u03bb as well. Nevertheless, the underlying space and the oscillator potential change\ndramatically when \u03bb < 0 (see [35]), and the corresponding quantum problem is currently\nunder investigation by making use of the techniques here presented.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was partially supported by the Spanish MICINN under grants MTM2010-18556\nand FIS2008-00209, by the Junta de Castilla y Le\u00f3n (project GR224), by the Banco Santander\u2013\nUCM (grant GR58/08-910556) and by the Italian\u2013Spanish INFN\u2013MICINN (project ACI20091083).\n\nReferences\n[1] A.
