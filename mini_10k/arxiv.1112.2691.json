INTRODUCTION\n\nGalaxy clusters are the most overdense cosmological\nregions in the Universe and are unique astronomical\ntools: their abundance constrains fundamental cosmological parameters and they provide an extreme laboratory for elucidating the role of local environment in the\nevolution of the massive galaxies.\nHowever, despite extensive multi-wavelength searches,\nonly a few evolved galaxy clusters with red galaxies\nhave been found at z & 1.5 (e.g McCarthy et al.\n2007; Andreon et al. 2009; Papovich et al. 2010;\nTanaka et al. 2010; Fassbender et al. 2011; Gobat et al.\n2011; Santos et al. 2011). More diffuse protoclusters\nof star-forming galaxies have been found to higher\nredshift (e.g. Steidel et al. 2000; Venemans et al. 2007;\nCapak et al. 2011), although it is unclear how they\nrelate to lower redshift massive clusters.\nIdeally we want to find massive distant structures using\nspectroscopy. The problem is that most cluster galaxies\nlspitler@astro.swin.edu.au\n1 Centre for Astrophysics & Supercomputing, Swinburne University, Hawthorn, VIC 3122, Australia\n2 Carnegie Observatories, Pasadena, CA 91101, USA\n3 Sterrewacht Leiden, Leiden University, NL-2300 RA Leiden,\nThe Netherlands\n4 George P. and Cynthia Woods Mitchell Institute for Fundamental Physics and Astronomy, and Department of Physics and\nAstronomy, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 778434242, USA\n5 Department of Astronomy, Yale University, New Haven, CT\n06520, USA\n6 Australian Research Council Super Science Fellow\n7 Hubble Fellow\n\u22c6 This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 meter Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.\n\nat z > 1.5 are too faint for spectroscopy, while photometric redshifts derived from broadband photometry are\ngenerally not accurate enough for secure identification.\nA novel approach is to use near-infrared imaging with\nmedium-bandwidth filters, which are narrower than traditional broadband filters and provide significantly more\naccurate photometric redshifts (e.g., \u03b4z/(1 + z) \u223c 1 \u2212 2%\nat z \u223c 2; van Dokkum et al. 2009; Whitaker et al. 2011)\nfor thousands of sources simultaneously over large contiguous fields of view (e.g., Wolf et al. 2003).\nUsing the newly commissioned FourStar near-IR\ncamera (Persson et al. 2008) on the 6.5m Magellan\nBaade Telescope, we have initiated a major survey to\nobtain deep medium-bandwidth near-IR imaging over\nseveral fields. Our custom filters span 1.0\u03bcm \u2212 1.8\u03bcm\nand hence trace the Balmer/4000\u00c5 break in galaxies at\n1.5 < z < 3.5. The FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey (Z\u2212FOURGE9 ) will be described in detail by Labb\u00e9\net al.,(in prep). This Letter demonstrates that the improved depth and redshift accuracies allow us to search\nfor massive galaxy overdensities at redshifts z & 1.5.\n2. OBSERVATIONS AND ANALYSIS\n\nAs part of the on-going survey we observed a\nsingle \u2248 11\u2032 \u00d7 11\u2032 pointing within the COSMOS\nfield (Scoville et al. 2007) with Magellan/FourStar\nin Spring 2011, imaging for 41 hours in 5 mediumbandwidth filters (J1 , J2 , J3 , Hs , Hl ) and the broad-band\nKs filter to 5\u03c3 point-source limiting depths (D= 1.5\u2032\u2032\naperture corrected to total) of 25.5, 25.4, 25.3, 24.8, 24.7\nand 24.8 AB mag, respectively. Raw images were pro9\n\n\\protecthttp://z-fourge.strw.leidenuniv.nl/\n\n\f2\n\nSpitler et al.\n\nFig. 1.- 7th nearest-neighbor surface density maps for z = 2.1 \u2212 2.3 in a \u2248 9\u2032 \u00d7 9\u2032 region in the COSMOS field. Units are standard\ndeviations above the mean. Density maps, including those from literature photometric redshift catalogs (Ilbert et al. 2009; Whitaker et al.\n2011), are labeled along with the limiting selection magnitude. Individual Z\u2212FOURGE galaxies at z = 2.1 \u2212 2.3 are represented by small\ncircles. The maps illustrate the advantage of deep near-infrared imaging with medium-band filters for finding large-scale structures at\nz \u223c 2.\n\ncessed using our custom pipeline, also used for the NEWFIRM Medium Band Survey (NMBS, Whitaker et al.\n2011).\nSExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996) was used to\nselect objects in the Ks \u2212image (FWHM \u2248 0.40\u2032\u2032 ;\n0.15\u2032\u2032 pixel\u22121 ) to a depth of Ks \u223c 24.5 and to extract\nD= 1.5\u2032\u2032 aperture fluxes from PSF-matched versions of\nour Z\u2212FOURGE COSMOS data, plus 23 optical and 4\nSpitzer/IRAC COSMOS legacy image sets. Photometric zeropoints were calibrated using sources in common\nwith the NMBS catalogue in COSMOS (Whitaker et al.\n2011). We adopt the AB magnitude system and a cosmology with H0 = 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9m = 0.3, and\n\u03a9\u039b = 0.7. Stars were culled using a U \u2212 J1 and J1 \u2212 Ks\ncolor-color criterion (Whitaker et al. 2011).\nWe derived photometric redshifts with EAZY\n(Brammer et al. 2008) and fitted Bruzual & Charlot\n(2003) stellar population models using FAST (Kriek et al.\n2009), assuming exponentially declining star-formation\nhistories, Solar metallicity and a Chabrier (2003) initial\nmass function. We note that photometric redshifts\nderived with similar near-IR medium-band filters\nyielded a normalized median absolute deviation of\n\u03b4z,nmad /(1 + z) = 2% at z = 1.7 \u2212 2.7 in the NMBS\nsurvey (van Dokkum et al. 2009).\n3. OVERDENSITIES AT Z = 2.2\n3.1. Discovery\n\nWe searched for high-redshift galaxy overdensities by\ncomputing surface density maps in narrow \u03b4z = 0.2 redshift slices between z = 1.5 \u2212 3.5 using the 7th nearest-\n\nneighbor metric (e.g., Papovich et al. 2010; Gobat et al.\n2011). At each location in the map, we calculate the projected distance to the 7th nearest neighbor and evaluate\n2\nthe projected density n7 = N/(\u03c0 \u2217 rN\n). The results do\nnot change significantly for density maps with N = 5\u22129.\nAs shown in Fig. 1, a system consisting of 3 strong\ngalaxy overdensities within a radius of 1.5\u2032 was found\nbetween z = 2.1 \u2212 2.3.\nAt these redshifts the\nBalmer/4000\u00c5 break passes through the FourStar\nJ1 (1.05\u03bcm), J2 (1.15\u03bcm), J3 (1.28\u03bcm) medium-band filters. Fig. 2 shows images of the overdensities, which\neach contain dense concentrations of galaxies with red\nJ2 \u2212 J3 colors, consistent with the presence of prominent\nBalmer/4000\u00c5 breaks at z \u223c 2.2.\nFig. 3 presents photometric redshifts for the overdensity galaxies and further confirms that they are strongly\npeaked at z \u2248 2.2. The overdensities have consistent\nmean redshifts (z A = 2.16 \u00b1 0.03, z B = 2.19 \u00b1 0.03,\nz C = 2.21 \u00b1 0.03; uncertainties are random error on the\nmean) and together show a weighted mean of 2.19 \u00b1 0.03\n(here we adopt as the uncertainty the range of the 3\noverdensity redshifts). The RMS scatter of individual\ngalaxies is 0.06 or \u03b4z/(1 + z) = 0.02. There are 7, 13,\n& 9 candidate members within < 30\u2032\u2032 of the overdensities10 A, B, C, respectively. The red objects furthermore\nhave steep Balmer/4000\u00c5 breaks between the J2 and J3\n10 We adopt the brightest galaxy as an overdensity's center:\n(10:00:15.753, +02:15:39.56), (10:00:18.380, +02:14:58.81), and\n(10:00:23.552, +02:14:34.13), for overdensity A, B & C, respectively (J2000).\n\n\fA z = 2.2 candidate galaxy cluster\n\n3\n\nFig. 2.- Color composite images in the J1 (blue,1.05\u03bcm), J2 (green,1.15\u03bcm) and J3 (red,1.28\u03bcm) \u2206\u03bb/\u03bb \u223c 10% filters, centered on each\noverdensity in the Z\u2212FOURGE observations with FourStar in the COSMOS field. Galaxies at z = 2.0 \u2212 2.3 with strong Balmer/4000\u00c5\nbreaks have red colors in this image and are marked with green symbols. White circles have r = 30\u2032\u2032 .\n\nfilters, as is shown in Fig. 4.\nWe also calculated a density map using existing photometric redshift catalogs in COSMOS (Ilbert et al. 2009;\nWhitaker et al. 2011) in Fig. 1. The overdensities are\ncompletely absent in the public i\u2212band selected catalog\nof Ilbert et al. (2009). Only a weak impression of the\noverdensities is apparent in the Ks \u2212band selected catalog of Whitaker et al. (2011). This substantiates the\ncritical role that deep, near-IR imaging with mediumband filters will play in understanding environment and\ngalaxy evolution at redshifts z > 1.5.\nWe note the candidate cluster satisfies the\nSpitzer/IRAC color based selection criteria of\nPapovich (2008), used to discover a z = 1.62 cluster (Papovich et al. 2010). However, unlike the IRAC\nselection, our catalogs provide accurate photometric\nredshifts, thus reducing spurious detections from foreground interlopers and enabling the secure identification\nof an overdensity at z \u223c 2.2.\n\nthe tight spatial configuration of the real overdensities.\nAs a final check, we analyzed 121 mock density maps\nfrom simulated light cones produced by the Mock Galaxy\nFactory (Bernyk et al.,in prep.). These are based upon\nthe Millennium Simulation (Springel et al. 2005) and\nsemi-analytical models of Croton et al. (2006). After\nintroducing fake redshift errors, we matched the number of observed galaxies in the Z\u2212FOURGE COSMOS\nfield by selecting an R-band absolute magnitude limit\nMR < \u221221.6 (roughly Ks . 24.5 at z = 2.2) and found\na consistent scatter (\u03c3n7 = 2.0 \u00b1 0.7 arcmin\u22122 ) with our\nown estimate.\nThe above results confirm that overdensities A & B\nare robust, while overdensity C appears to be slightly\nless significant. Its close proximity to A & B raises the\nintriguing possibility that it is associated with the AB\nsystem. We therefore include overdensity C in the following.\n4.

Significance of the overdensities\nTo quantify the statistical significance of the overdensities, we first estimated the mean and intrinsic scatter in\nthe nearest neighbor density map of Fig. 1. To avoid biasing these values by the strong overdensities themselves,\nwe use the mean density (n7 = 2.6 arcmin\u22122 ) and its\nstandard deviation (\u03c3n7 = 1.4 arcmin\u22122 ) from adjacent\nredshift slices (z = 1.9 \u2212 2.1 and z = 2.3 \u2212 2.5). These\nstatistics reflect the distribution of nearest neighbor densities evaluated only at the locations of all galaxies in a\nredshift slice. We find that the overdensities are \u2248 20,\n50, and 10\u03c3 deviations for A, B, and C, respectively.\nWe also performed a bootstrap resampling of the\nFourStar redshifts. At each instance, we shuffled all\nredshifts in our catalog and generated a 7th nearestneighbor density map. To robustly identify overdensities in the resampled maps, we tuned SExtractor\n(DETECT THRESH, SEEING FWHM) to detect only overdensities A & B in the real density map. In only 3 of the\n1000 resampled maps was a single overdensity detected.\nWhen tuned to find the less significant overdensity C,\nSExtractor detects only 65 overdensities in the resampled maps. Note the number of valid analogs in the resampled maps would decrease further if we tried to match\n\n4.1. Galaxy properties\nOf the 313 galaxies in the redshift slice 2.1 \u2264 z \u2264 2.3\nover the full Z\u2212FOURGE COSMOS field, 29 galaxies\nare within 30\u2032\u2032 of a z = 2.2 overdensity. We consider\nthese candidate overdensity galaxies.\nFig. 5 shows observed color-magnitude diagrams for all\ngalaxies having 2.1 \u2264 z \u2264 2.3. The J1 \u2212 Hl color probes\ncontinuum on both sides of the 4000\u00c5 break and avoids\nrest-frame H\u03b1 in Ks . The histograms in Fig. 5 show that\nthe non-overdensity or \"field\" distribution is dominated\nby blue galaxies (J1 \u2212 Hl < 1.6) while the overdensity\ngalaxies have a higher fraction of red galaxies.\nWe calculated the red galaxy fractions, fred =\nNred /Ntotal , of each overdensity. Here Nred is the number of galaxies with J1 \u2212 Hl \u2265 1.6 at all magnitudes\nwithin r < 30\u2032\u2032 of an overdensity at 2.1 \u2264 z \u2264 2.3.\nApart from C (fred = 0.2 \u00b1 0.2), the two main overdensities show somewhat higher red galaxy fractions (together fred = 0.5 \u00b1 0.2) compared to the field population\n(fred = 0.20 \u00b1 0.03; fred errors reflect counting statistics\nonly).\nFig. 5 shows that the red galaxies have similar colors to\nBC03 single-burst stellar population models at z = 2.2\nand formation redshifts of zf orm & 3.

The histograms are normalized by the area from\nwhich the sample was drawn. The control histograms (black) in\nthe top panels are the cumulative spatial distribution around all\nz = 2.1 \u2212 2.3 galaxies. The control histograms in the right panel\nare all galaxies in the field. The overdensities show concentrated\nsurface densities and peaked redshift distributions compared to the\ncontrol samples.\n\nFig. 4.- Observed 32-band SEDs of the central brightest galaxies\n(BCGs) in the overdensities (left panels) and randomly selected\noverdensity members (right panels). The highlighted red points\nare our custom FourStar filters, sensitive to near-IR light at 1.0 \u2212\n1.8 micron. The higher resolution spectral sampling of the SEDs\nin this range allow us to pinpoint the Balmer/4000\u00c5 break as it\nshifts through medium-bandwidths 1.5 < z < 3.5. Overplotted are\nthe best-fit EAZY photometric redshift templates (blue). BCG A\nhas a quiescent stellar population, while BCGs B & C have some\nstar formation, including enhanced Ks \u2212band flux likely due to H\u03b1\nemission.\n\nels with exponentially declining star formation histories\nto the full SEDs confirms that the red galaxies are on\naverage \u223c 1 Gyr old (zf orm \u223c 3.3), contain little ongoing star formation and span a stellar mass range of\nM\u2217 = 0.1 \u2212 5 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 . In contrast, blue overdensity\ngalaxies (J1 \u2212 Hl < 1.6) are best-fit by \u223c 0.1 Gyr BC03\nmodels and have masses M\u2217 = 108 \u2212 1010 M\u2299 .\nWe find candidate \"brightest cluster galaxies\" (BCGs)\nin each overdensity, with relatively large stellar masses:\nM\u2217A = 3 \u00d7 1011 , M\u2217B = 1 \u00d7 1011 , M\u2217C = 1 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 . As\nshown in Fig. 4, BCG A is a quiescent \"red and dead\"\ngalaxy, while BCGs B & C may contain recent star formation. A close inspection of BCGs A & B in Fig. 2 suggests they also have distinct structural properties: the\nlatter is compact11 (re = 2+0.3\n\u22120.5 kpc) while the former has\na larger core (re = 3+0.5\nkpc)\nplus an extended diffuse\n\u22120.5\nstellar halo. With 3 \u2212 4 satellites within r \u223c 30 kpc,\nwe speculate BCG B will undergo a series of mergers and perhaps \"puff-up\" in size (Hopkins et al. 2010).\nClearly we are probing an epoch where even some of the\nmost massive galaxies in the highest density regions were\nstill forming a significant fraction of their stars (e.g.,\nGlazebrook et al. 2004; van Dokkum & van der Marel\n2007; Eisenhardt et al. 2008; Tran et al. 2010).\n4.2. Comparison to known high-z overdensities\n\nTo help us interpret the z = 2.2 overdensities, we will\nnow characterize various global properties of the overdensities and compare them to known high-redshift galaxy\nclusters and protoclusters.\nAs shown in Fig. 1, the individual z = 2.2 overdensities\nhave spatial extents of r = 30\u2032\u2032 or 250 kpc. The galaxy\nclusters at z & 1.6 show similar projected compact sizes\n(Andreon et al. 2009; Papovich et al. 2010; Tanaka et al.\n2010; Gobat et al. 2011). Notably, the z = 1.62 cluster (Papovich et al. 2010; Tanaka et al. 2010) shows two\ngalaxy clumps or subclusters over a region of \u223c 1\u2032 . This\nis not unlike the configuration discussed here. In contrast, known protoclusters at z & 2 are typically more\ndiffuse, with lower overdensities and \u223c 8\u00d7 larger sizes\n(Steidel et al. 2000; Venemans et al. 2007). Indeed, overdensities A & B each show core surface densities of & 50\ngalaxies arcmin\u22122 , with 5 \u2212 6 members at r . 10\u2032\u2032 .\nTo estimate the total halo mass (Mhalo ) of each overdensity, we use the relation between M\u2217 and Mhalo at\nz = 2.2 from the halo occupancy distribution analysis of\nMoster et al. (2010) and apply these to the M\u2217 of the\ncentral BCGs. Although the uncertainties involved in\nconverting stellar mass to halo mass are significant, we\nA\nestimate that the overdensities have: Mhalo\n\u2248 6 \u00d7 1013 ,\nB\n13\nC\n13\nMhalo \u2248 1 \u00d7 10 , Mhalo \u2248 1 \u00d7 10 M\u2299 . The Mhalo of\nA is in the same range as estimates for the z = 2.07\ncluster (Gobat et al. 2011). Using a 1 Gpc3 cosmological\nsimulation (GiggleZ; Poole et al.,in prep.; 21603 particles, WMAP5 cosmology, Komatsu et al. 2009), we find\nthat z = 2.2 simulated halos with these masses will\ngrow into z = 0 halos with mean masses of Mhalo \u223c\n0.5 \u2212 5 \u00d7 1014 M\u2299 .\nThe detection of diffuse X-ray emission would provide\n11 As measured on the K -band FourStar image using 2D\ns\nS\u00e9rsic models fitted with ISHAPE, which is specifically designed to\nmeasure sizes of partially resolved objects (Larsen 1999).\n\n\fA z = 2.2 candidate galaxy cluster\n\n5\n\nFig. 5.- J1 \u2212 Hl versus Hl (left panel) and versus i (right panel) color-magnitude diagrams. Grey points and open histograms are for all\n313 galaxies with 2.1 \u2264 z \u2264 2.3. Galaxy overdensity members are shown with the colored points and red hatched histograms. Histograms\nare arbitrarily normalized. Limits correspond to 2\u03c3 near-IR limiting depths. The overdensities have a higher fraction of red galaxies\ncompared to the field. In the left panel, black lines show the z = 2.2 redshifted Bruzual & Charlot (2003) single-burst model predictions\nwith Solar metallicity and a Chabrier (2003) initial mass function for various ages or formation redshifts (zf orm ; computed with EzGal,\nwww.baryons.org/ezgal). In the right panel, red galaxies are generally very faint in the optical i\u2212band. E.g., 80% of galaxies redder than\nJ1 \u2212 Hl > 1.6 are fainter than i = 25 (dotted line).\n\nindependent confirmation of the existence of a deep gravitational potential well. We find no diffuse X-ray emission at the locations of the z = 2.2 overdensities in the\nCOSMOS 55ks XMM and 200ks Chandra legacy images\n(Hasinger et al. 2007; Elvis et al. 2009; Cappelluti et al.\n2009) to a point-source 0.5 \u2212 2 keV sensitivity limit of\n\u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u221215 and 2 \u00d7 10\u221216 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , respectively.\nThe XMM flux limit corresponds to an X-ray luminosity\nupper limit of 7 \u00d7 1043 erg s\u22121 , similar to the value estimated for the extended emission around the z = 2.07\nGobat et al. (2011) cluster.\nOverall, the newly discovered z = 2.2 overdensities\nshow a number of characteristics (e.g., Mhalo estimates,\npresence of evolved massive galaxies, compact spatial distribution) similar to spectroscopically-confirmed\ngalaxy clusters at 1.5 < z < 2.1 (Papovich et al. 2010;\nTanaka et al. 2010; Gobat et al. 2011). Even so, there\nare also marked variations: e.g., overdensity C contains\nmostly blue star-forming galaxies, more resembling our\nfield population at z = 2.1\u22122.3. Given the overall resemblance and the close proximity of the three overdensities\non the sky, we consider it likely that all three overdensities may be part of a single forming massive cluster.\nAs shown in Fig. 1, the region surrounding the z = 2.2\nsystem contains several less-significant galaxy overdensities, as one might expect to find around a large overdensity (e.g., Springel et al. 2006). The overdensity just to\nthe north of the z = 2.2 system is particularly interesting: it contains two M\u2217 \u2248 1\u22125\u00d71011M\u2299 evolved galaxies\nseparated by just 20\u2032\u2032 .\n5. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nUsing the first data from the Magellan/FourStar\nGalaxy Evolution Survey (Z\u2212FOURGE), we have detected in the COSMOS field the most distant example of\nstrong galaxy overdensities with red galaxies. The system at z = 2.2 extends r \u223c 1.5\u2032 on the sky and appears\n\nto be made up of multiple subcomponents, including two\noverdensities detected at & 20\u03c3 above the mean and another at \u223c 10\u03c3. The two strongest overdensities, A & B,\neach resemble spectroscopically-confirmed galaxy clusters at z & 1.6 (Papovich et al. 2010; Tanaka et al. 2010;\nGobat et al. 2011): they contain significant populations\nof evolved galaxies (mean stellar age \u223c 1 Gyr or zf orm \u223c\n3.3) in a compact spatial distribution (< 250kpc) embedded in massive halos of Mhalo \u223c 1 \u2212 6 \u00d7 1013 M\u2299 .\nPerhaps the most outstanding feature of the aggregate system is that it consists of multiple distinct galaxy\noverdensities in close spatial configuration. Whether the\nthree z = 2.2 overdensities are a single gravitationally\nbound structure is not clear. Ultimately, high precision spectroscopic redshifts of this structure are needed\nto confirm its existence and measure its velocity dispersion. Still, even if each overdensity is confirmed with\nspectroscopy, they could still be unbound and coupled\nto the Hubble flow. In this case, they possibly trace a\nfilament in the dark matter density field and may evolve\ninto a large-scale structure at z = 0, e.g., a supercluster\n(Geller & Huchra 1989).\nTo help us interpret the z = 2.2 system as a whole, we\nsearched for analogs in the 1 Gpc3 GiggleZ cosmological\nsimulation (Poole et al., in prep.; see $4.2) by running\n2 million random line of sight (each a cylinder with 0.7\nMpc radius and 50 Mpc length to match the 2\u03c3 redshift\nuncertainty, 2\u03c3z \u2248 0.06, of the overdensities). If a 3-halo\nsystem matching the set of overdensity Mhalo estimates is\nfound, then 98% percent of the time 2 or 3 of these halos\nwill merge into a z = 0 cluster with Mhalo \u223c 1014 \u2212\n1015 M\u2299 . At z = 2.2 in the simulation, these 2- and\n3-halo systems show typical maximum separations of \u223c\n0.9 \u2212 1.8 Mpc 3D from their mean positions. Although\nthis comparison is limited by the preliminary halo masses\nof the z = 2.2 overdensities, these results may suggest\n\n\f6\n\nSpitler et al.\n\nthere is high probability that two or more of the z = 2.2\noverdensities will merge by z = 0.\nIf two or more of the overdensities are currently\ngravitationally bound, we may be viewing merging subclusters that are each in different evolutionary stages,\nincluding some whose galaxies are rapidly evolving and\nonly just forming their red galaxy population (e.g.,\noverdensity C). Perhaps this signifies the system is in\na transitional phase between the known z & 2 \"protoclusters\" (e.g. Steidel et al. 2005) with more diffuse\ndistributions of blue galaxies, and the lower-redshift\ngalaxy clusters with prominent red sequences. Of course,\nprotocluster observations have largely been opticallybased, thus deep near-IR observations of such structures\nand deep optical spectroscopy of our candidate cluster\nare needed to understand the relationship between the\nvarious structures at z & 1.5.\nThe discovery of the z = 2.2 system demonstrates\nthe powerful combination of near-IR medium-bandwidth\nfilters and deep imaging of the Z\u2212FOURGE survey.\nThese systems were undetectable in earlier optical and\nnear-IR catalogs. For example, in the optically-selected\n(i < 25) catalog of Ilbert et al. (2009), the overdensity is completely absent in our redshift slice of interest\n(z = 2.1 \u2212 2.3). The relatively bright optical limit of\nthis catalog means evolved galaxies at these redshifts are\nmissed entirely (only 2 of our red overdensity galaxies\nhave itotal < 25, see Fig. 5). Even with the K-band selected NMBS catalog of Whitaker et al. (2011), only a\nweak overdensity is seen in Fig. 1, as the majority of the\n\nz = 2.2 overdensity galaxies are too faint to be detected\nin the 1.3 mag. shallower NMBS.\nThe first results of the Z\u2212FOURGE survey suggest we\nare reaching a critical threshold in our ability to study\ngalaxy evolution as a function of local environment at z &\n1.5. By combining the spatial distribution with improved\nredshift information from deep medium-band filters in\nthe near-IR, we can start to correlate the properties of\nKs \u2212selected galaxies with their environment, something\nthat has so far only been done in detail for Lyman-break\ngalaxies (e.g., Steidel et al. 2000).\nWe acknowledge the Cook's Branch Conservancy for\nthe gracious hospitality and comfortable surroundings\nwhich permitted the discovery of this exciting system.\nWe are grateful to the FourStar instrumentation team\nand staff at LCO.
