INTRODUCTION\nThe linear k\u22a5 -factorization is part and parcel\nof the pQCD description of high energy hard processes off free nucleons. A large thickness of a\ntarget nucleus introduces a new scale - the socalled saturation scale Q2A , - which breaks the\nlinear k\u22a5 -factorization theorems for hard scattering in nuclear environment. This property can be\nlinked to the unitarity constraints for the colour\ndipole-nucleus interaction. In this talk I review\nthe recent work by the ITEP-J\u00fclich-Landau collaboration in which a new concept of the nonlinear k\u22a5 -factorization has been introduced [1,2,3,4]\nand illustrate the major results on an example of\ndijet production in DIS off heavy nuclei.\n\nThe x-dependence of \u03c3(x, r) is governed by the\ncolour dipole BFKL equation [9]. The unintegrated gluon density f (x, \u03ba) furnishes a universal\ndescription of F2p (x, Q2 ) and of the final states.\nFor instance, the linear k\u22a5 -factorization for forward dijet cross section reads\n\u03b1S (p2 )\nd\u03c3N\nf (x, \u2206)\n=*\n2\n2(2\u03c0)2\n+d \u2206\n\ndzd2 p\n\n2\n\n\u00d7 |\u03a8(z, p+ ) \u2212 \u03a8(z, p+ \u2212 \u2206)| ,\n\n2. k\u22a5 -FACTORIZATION FOR DIS OFF\nFREE NUCLEONS\n\nwhere \u2206 = p+ + p\u2212 is the jet-jet decorrelation\nmomentum.\n\nThe parton-fusion approach to shadowing introduced in 1975 [5] is equivalent to the unitarization on the colour dipole-nucleus interaction\n[6]. One starts with the colour-dipole factorization for DIS at small x <\n\u223c xA = 1/RA mN , when\nthe coherency over the thickness of the nucleus\nholds for the q q\u0304 Fock states of the virtual photon:\n2\n\n\u2217\n\n(1)\n\n3.

I.e., the linear\nk\u22a5 -factorization in terms of the collective nuclear\nglue holds, which is a feature of DIS where the\nphoton is a colour singlet projectile. The same is\nnot true for other projectiles, see Sch\u00e4fer's talk at\nthis conference [14].\nThe nuclear dijet spectrum takes a simple form\nin the large-Nc approximation:\nZ 1\n1\nd\u03c3in\n\u03b1\n\u03c3\nT\n(b)\nd\u03b2\n=\nS 0\nd2 bdzdp\u2212 d\u2206\n2(2\u03c0)2\n0\n\n2\n\n(7)\n\n.\n\nIt is a manifestly nonlinear functional of the collective nuclear glue and here emerges a concept of\nthe nonlinear k\u22a5 - factorization. The slice (1 \u2212 \u03b2)\nin which the dipole was in the colour-singlet state\ngives the Initial State Interaction (distortion of\nthe WF) The slice \u03b2 in which the dipole is in the\ncolour-octet state gives the Final State Interaction. In DIS it looks as an independent broadening of the quark and antiquark jets, such a symmetric form no longer holds for pQCD subprocesses of relevance to pA collisions as the interplay of ISI and FSI becomes more involved; still\nthe generic structure of the spectra is similar to\n(8) [4].\n2\nFor hard dijets, |p\u00b1 |2 >\n\u223c QA , the dijet spectrum\ntake the convolution form:\n\nd\u03c3in\n= T (b) \u00d7\nd2 bdzd2 p+ d2 \u2206\n\nZ\n\n\u00d7\u03a6(2\u03b2\u03bbc \u03bdA (b), \u2206 \u2212 \u03ba)\n\n2\n\nd \u03ba\n\nZ\n\n1\n\nd\u03b2\n\n0\n\nd\u03c3N\n.\ndzd2 p+ d2 \u03ba\n\n(8)\n\n\f4\nwhere\n\u03a6(\u03bdA (b), \u03ba) = exp(\u2212\u03bdA (b))\u03b4 (2) (\u03ba) + \u03c6(\u03bdA (b), \u03ba)\nand \u03bbc \u2261 CA /2CF . The convolution form (8)\nmakes the nuclear enhancement of decorrelation\n2\nobvious one. Semihard dijets, |p\u00b1 |2 <\n\u223c QA , are\ncompletely decorrelated.\nThe work on applications to the centrality dependence of single-jet spectra to dijet decorrelations at RHIC [15,16] is in progress.\n6. SMALL-x EVOLUTION OF COLLECTIVE NUCLEAR GLUE.\nDespite the manifest breaking of the linear k\u22a5 factorization, the collective nuclear glue remains a\nuseful concept. For a free nucleon target the effect\nof the q q\u0304g and higher Fock states in the photon\nis reabsorbed in the linear BFKL evolution for\nthe dipole cross section with the photon treated\nas the q q\u0304 state. One possible definition of the\nnonlinear BFKL evolution for nuclear glue is to\ninsist on the same representation for nuclear cross\nsection. It is indeed possible although without a\nclosed-form evolution equation.\nWe comment here on first correction \u221d log x1 to\nthe nuclear profile function and nuclear collective\nglue. The correction \u03b4\u0393A (x, b, r) to the colour\ndipole-nucleus profile function for the q q\u0304g Fock\nstate in the photon equals\nZ\nZ\n\u2202\u03b4\u0393A (x, b, r)\nr2\n=\nK\nd2 b\nd2 \u03c1 2\n0\n1\n\u03c1 (\u03c1 \u2212 r)2\n\u2202 log x\nZ\n\u00d72 d2 b[\u03933A (b, \u03c1, r) \u2212 \u0393A (b, r)] (9)\n\u03933A (b, \u03c1, r) =\n=\n\n1 \u2212 S3A (b, \u03c1, r)\n1\n1 \u2212 exp[\u2212 \u03c33 (\u03c1, r)T (b)]\n2\n\nwhere \u03c33 (\u03c1, r) is the 3-parton cross section [8].\nA simplified Glauber-Gribov formula holds at\nlarge-Nc, S3A (b, \u03c1, r) = S2A (b, \u03c1 \u2212 r)S2A (b, \u03c1).\nHere \u2202\u03b4\u0393A (x, b, r)/\u2202 log x1 is a nonlinear functional of \u03932A , the identification of \u0393A (x, b, r)\nwith \u03932A (x, b, r), and the extension of the first\niteration to what has become known as the\n\nclosed-form Balitsky-Kovchegov nonlinear equation [17] is unwarranted. In terms of the nuclear transparency for large dipoles, SA (b, \u03c30 ) =\nexp[\u2212 21 \u03c30 T (b)], the first correction to the unintegrated nuclear glue takes the form\n\u2202\u03b4\u03c6A (x, b, \u2206)\n= SA (b, \u03c30 )KBF KL \u2297 \u03c6(b, \u2206)\n\u2202 log x1\nZ\nn\n+K0 d2 pd2 k\u03c6(b, k) K(\u2206 + p, \u2206 + k)\u03c6(b, p)\no\n\u2212K(p, p + \u2206 + k)\u03c6(b, \u2206)\n\n= SA (b, \u03c30 )KBF KL \u2297 \u03c6(b, \u2206) +\n\u0002\n\u0003\n+KN onLin \u03c6(b, \u2206) (10)\n\nwhere K(p, k) = (p \u2212 k)2 /p2 k2 . It contains an\nabsorption suppressed linear BFKL term with the\nfamiliar kernel KBF KL [18]. For central DIS off\nheavy nuclei SA \u2192 0 and evolution is entirely\ndriven by the nonlinear term quadratic in \u03c6(k).\nMaking use of an explicit form of K(p, k), one\ncan recast (10) for the leading conformal twist\nnuclear glue in an alternative form\n\n\u2202\u03b4\u03c6A (x, b, \u2206)\n= KBF KL \u2297 \u03c6(b, \u2206) + Q[\u03c6](b, \u2206) . (11)\n\u2202 log(1/x)\nHere the linear term evolves with the conventional\nBFKL kernel, whereas the nonlinear term takes a\nparticularly simple form\nZ\ni2\n2K0 h\n2\nQ[\u03c6](b, \u2206) = \u2212 2\nd\nq\u03c6(b,\nq)\n\u2206\n\u22062\nZ\n2 Z\nd p\nd2 q\u03c6(b, q).\n\u22122K0 \u03c6(b, \u2206)\n2 p2\n2\np\n\u2206\nFor hard gluons, \u22062 > Q2A , one can use an ap\u00012\nproximation \u03c6(q) \u223c \u03c6(\u2206) \u22062 /q 2 with the result\n\u03c6(\u2206)\n.\nQ[\u03c6](\u2206; b) \u2248 \u22124K0 * \u22062 \u03c62 (\u2206) \u221d\n\u22062\nThe nonlinear component in (11) gives a pure\nhigher twist contribution. It doesn't exhaust the\nnuclear higher twist terms, though, because the\none is contained also in \u03c6(x, \u2206; b), see the discussion in [1,10]. The character of nonlinearity in\nterms of GA (b, x, Q) is instructive:\n\u2202GA (b, x, Q)\n\u2202 2 \u03b4GA (b, x, Q)\n= KBF KL \u2297\n\u2202 log(1/x)\u2202 log Q2\n\u2202 log Q2\n\n\f5\n\n\u2212\n\n4\u03b1S (Q2 )T (b)\n*\nQ2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202GA (b, x, Q)\n\u2202 log Q2\n\n\u00132\n\nNow have a look at the plateau region of soft\ngluons , \u22062 \u226a Q2A . Here eq. (10) takes the form\n\u2202\u03b4\u03c6A (x, b, \u2206)\n= \u22122C\u03c0K0 \u03c6(x, b, 0)\n\u2202 log x1\n\n(12)\n\nwhere the constant factor, C \u223c 1, depends on the\nform of the collective nuclear glue. If we recall\nthat\n1\n\u03c6(x, b, 0) \u223c\n\u03c0Q2A (b, x)\nthen (12) entails an expansion of the plateau\nwidth with the decrease of x:\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n2\n2\nQA (b) =\u21d2 QA (b) 1 + 2C\u03c0K0 log\nx\nThe full-fledged nonlinear evolution will be in ef2\nfect for soft-to-hard gluon momenta \u22062 <\n\u223c QA .\n7. CONCLUSIONS\nNuclear saturation is a straightforward consequence of opacity of heavy nuclei to large colour\ndipoles. The imposition of unitarity constraints\nwithin the colour-dipole approach leads to a\nunique definition and expansion of nuclear unintegrated glue in terms of the collective glue of\noverlapping nucleons. The problem of a nonabelian intranuclear evolution of colour dipoles\nhas been solved and consistent description of\nsingle-jet and dijet production in DIS off nuclei has been developed. We have proven the\nbreaking k\u22a5 factorization and instead formulated\nthe nonlinear k\u22a5 -factorization for forward dijet production in DIS. The formalism is readily\nextendible to proton-nucleus collision in the kinematic conditions of the RHIC experiments, the\ncorresponding work is in progress. We applied\nour technique to the nonlinear BFKL evolution\nof collective nuclear glue and explored the twist\nproperties of the nonlinear component of this\nequation. The work an applications to jet production in pA collisions at RHIC is in progress.\nAcknowledgements: I'm grateful to R. Fiore\nand B.
