Since the first realization of quadrature entangled beams by Ou et al. [2], various methods, such as\n\u03c7(2) process in optical parametric amplifier (OPA) [3],\nor Kerr effect in optical fibers [4], have been used to\ngenerate non separable beams. Recently, the concept of\npolarization entanglement, i.e. entanglement of Stokes\noperators between two beams, has been investigated by\nKorolkova et al. [5], and first demonstrated experimentally by Bowen et al. [6] by mixing two squeezed beams\nissued from independent OPAs. The Kerr non-linearity\nof fibers was also exploited by Gl\u00f6ckl et al. to generate\na pulsed source of polarization entanglement [7].\nIn this paper we show evidence for continuous variable\nentanglement generated using the interaction between\na linearly polarized coherent field and a cloud of cold\ncesium atoms placed in a high finesse optical cavity. We\ndemonstrate the entanglement using the inseparability\ncriterion proposed by Duan et al. and Simon [8]. We\ngenerate two kinds of entanglement with the same\nsystem, quadrature entanglement and polarization\nentanglement. For this, we use the recently reported\ngeneration of polarization squeezing [9] in the field\nthat has interacted with cold atoms; both the mean\nfield mode and the vacuum mode with orthogonal\npolarization exiting the cavity can be squeezed. First,\nwe show how a direct measurement of the quadrature\nentanglement of the beam exiting the cavity can be\nachieved using two balanced homodyne detections. We\nthen give the form of the covariance matrix and the\nassociated entanglement of formation (EOF), which,\nfor Gaussian symmetric states, is directly related to\nthe inseparability criterion value [10]. Last, we produce\ntwo non separable beams by mixing two parts of the\nprevious outgoing beam with a strong field and achieve\npolarization entanglement by locking the relative phases\nbetween the strong field and the weak field exiting the\n\ncavity.\nFirst, let us consider two orthogonally polarized modes\nAa and Ab of the electromagnetic field satisfying the\nusual bosonic commutation rules [A\u03b1 , A\u2020\u03b2 ] = \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 . If\nX\u03b1 (\u03b8) = (A\u2020\u03b1 ei\u03b8 + A\u03b1 e\u2212i\u03b8 ) and Y\u03b1 (\u03b8) = X\u03b1 (\u03b8 + \u03c0/2) are\nthe usual quadrature operators (rotated in the Fresnel\ndiagram by angle \u03b8), Xa + Xb and Ya \u2212 Yb are the continuous variable analogous of the EPR-type operators first\nintroduced by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen [11]. The\ncriterion of [8] sets a limit for inseparability on the sum\nof the operator variances\n\u0003\n1\u0002 2\n\u2206 (Xa + Xb )(\u03b8) + \u22062 (Ya \u2212 Yb )(\u03b8) < 2\n2\n(1)\nFor states with Gaussian statistics, Ia,b < 2 is a sufficient\ncondition for entanglement and has already been used in\nseveral experiments to demonstrate continuous variable\nentanglement [5, 6, 7]. Moreover, Giedke et al. recently\ncalculated the EOF of Gaussian symmetric states [10]\nand showed it to be directly related to the amount of\nEPR-type correlations given by (1).\nIn our system, an x-polarized beam interacts with a\ncloud of cold cesium atoms in an optical cavity. The experimental set-up [9] is shown in Fig. 1. We probe the\natoms with a linearly polarized laser beam detuned by\nabout 50 MHz in the red of the 6S1/2 , F=4 to 6P3/2 ,\nF=5 transition. The optical power of the probe beam\nranges from 5 to 15 \u03bcW. After exiting the cavity, both\nthe mean field mode Ax and the orthogonally polarized\nvacuum mode Ay are squeezed for frequencies ranging between 3 and 12 MHz. An interpretation of these results\ncan be provided by modelling the complicated 6S1/2 , F=4\nto 6P3/2 , F=5 transition by an X-like four-level atomic\nstructure [12]. When the optical transitions are saturated, the atoms behave as a Kerr-like medium for the\nmean field mode Ax , which can be squeezed. Furthermore, the orthogonally polarized vacuum mode Ay is also\nsqueezed on account of cross-Kerr effect, but for an orthogonal quadrature [9, 12].\nIa,b (\u03b8) =\n\n\f2\n\nOur goal is to retrieve the two modes with orthogonal\npolarizations which exhibit maximal EPR-type correlations according to the inseparability criterion (1). We\ntherefore minimize the quantity Ia,b (\u03b8) with respect to\na, b and \u03b8. Expanding (1) yields\nIa,b (\u03b8) = h\u03b4A\u2020a \u03b4Aa + \u03b4Aa \u03b4A\u2020a + \u03b4Ab \u03b4A\u2020b + \u03b4A\u2020b \u03b4Ab i\n+2[e\u22122i\u03b8 h\u03b4Aa \u03b4Ab i + e2i\u03b8 h\u03b4A\u2020a \u03b4A\u2020b i]\n\n(2)\n\nThe right hand side of the first line in (2) is independent of the polarization basis, while the second line can\nbe written as 4 cos(2\u03b8 \u2212 2\u03c6)|h\u03b4Aa \u03b4Ab i|, where 2\u03c6 is the\nphase angle of h\u03b4Aa \u03b4Ab i. Minimizing Ia,b (\u03b8) corresponds\nto maximizing |h\u03b4Aa \u03b4Ab i| with respect to a, b. In order\nto find the optimal field components a, b, we introduce\nanother polarization basis u, v, such that h\u03b4Au \u03b4Av i = 0.\nIt can be shown that there always exists such a polarization basis and that the u and v modes quadrature\nvariances are minimal for the same value of \u03b8 [13]. The\noptimal correlations produced in the system are directly\nrelated to the quantum noise properties of these modes\nu, v. Indeed, the maximally correlated modes a\u2217 , b\u2217 are\n\u221a\n\u221a\nAa\u2217 = (Au + iAv )/ 2, Ab\u2217 = (Au \u2212 iAv )/ 2 (3)\nand the minimum value of Ia,b is then given by the sum\nof the u, v modes minimal noises\n\u0002\n\u0003\nIa\u2217 ,b\u2217 = min Ia,b (\u03b8) = min \u22062 Xu (\u03b8) + \u22062 Xv (\u03b8) (4)\na,b,\u03b8\n\n\u03b8\n\nConsequently, if one or two of the u, v modes are\nsqueezed, the value Ia\u2217 ,b\u2217 corresponding to maximal correlations is equal to the sum of their squeezing. Experimentally, one has to look for the u, v-type modes, a signature of which being that Iu,v (\u03b8) does not depend on\n\u03b8 [see (2)], and measure their squeezing (if any). The\n\nFIG. 1: Experimental set-up: PBS: polarizing beam splitter; \u03bb/2: half-wave plate; PZT: piezo-electric ceramic; SA:\nspectrum analyzer. T = 0.1 is the transmission of the cavity\ncoupling mirror.\n\nmaximally correlated modes are then given by (3) and\nthe amount of their EPR-type correlations by (4).\nLet us note that modes u, v are not stricto sensu\nuncorrelated, since h\u03b4Au \u03b4A\u2020v i can be non zero. However,\none can think of the correlation properties of modes\na\u2217 , b\u2217 as being created by the mixing of the u and\nv modes, as it is usually produced by mixing two\nindependent squeezed beams [2, 4, 6]. Let us stress that\nthis analysis provides a general framework for finding\nout the maximal correlations produced in a two-mode\nsystem exhibiting quantum properties. This method\nis of interest for a class of systems such as the optical\nparametric oscillator in which the correlations are not\nproduced by mixing independent beams [14].\nComing back to our system, which is symmetrical with\nrespect to the circularly polarized modes A\u00b1 , it is easy to\nsee that h\u03b4Ax \u03b4Ay i = 0 because Ax and Ay are combinations with equal weights of A\u00b1 . Since they are squeezed\nfor orthogonal quadratures, one can set Au = Ax and\nAv = iAy , which are now squeezed for the same quadrature. Then, using (3), the maximally entangled modes\nare the \u00b145\u25e6 modes to the x, y basis. This gives us the\nrelevant quantity, I+45,\u221245\u221a(\u03b8) , which is to be measured.\nUsing A\u00b145 = (Ax \u00b1 Ay )/ 2, the inseparability criterion\nfor the \u00b145\u25e6 modes can be expressed directly in terms\nof the x, y modes variances with Xu (\u03b8) = Xx (\u03b8) and\nXv (\u03b8) = Yy (\u03b8)\nI+45,\u221245 (\u03b8) = \u22062 Xx (\u03b8) + \u22062 Yy (\u03b8) < 2\n\n(5)\n\nWhen \u03b8 corresponds to the angle \u03b8sq of the squeezed\nquadrature of Ax , both variances are below unity, and\nI+45,\u221245 (\u03b8sq ) < 2.\nIn order to experimentally check the inseparability criterion (5), we need to simultaneously measure the fluctuations of Ax and iAy . After the output of the cavity, we\ninsert a quarter-wave plate that rotates the noise ellipsoid of vacuum mode Ay by \u03c0/2, the beam is mixed on\na beamsplitter with a local oscillator (LO), and the two\nresulting beams are sent into two balanced homodyne detections [Fig. 1]. Thus, we simultaneously measure the\nquadrature noise of each beam for the same quadrature.\nThe sum of these two signals directly gives the sought\nquantity I+45,\u221245 (\u03b8). In Fig. 2(b), we plot a typical\nmeasurement of I+45,\u221245 as a function of \u03b8, for an analysis frequency of 5 MHz. Its minimal value is about 1.9\n[1.86 corrected from losses] and corresponds to a case\nfor which Ax and iAy are both squeezed by about 5%\n[Fig. 2(a)]. Quadrature entanglement is thus achieved in\na frequency range given by the cavity bandwidth (3 to\n12 MHz).\nConsistently with the general method described above,\nwe also checked that modes Ax and iAy correspond indeed to u, v-type modes. We therefore measured the\nquantity Ix,y in a similar manner as I+45,\u221245 , and verified that it is independent of \u03b8 [Fig. 2(c)], thus proving\n\n\f3\n[10]\nE = f (n \u2212 k) = f [I+45,\u221245 (\u03b8sq )/2]\nwith f (x) = c+ (x) log2 [c+ (x)] \u2212 c\u2212 (x) log2 [c\u2212 (x)] and\nc\u00b1 (x) = (x\u22121/2 \u00b1 x1/2 )2 /4. For I+45,\u221245 = 1.86 \u00b1 0.02,\nthe EOF is E = 0.014 \u00b1 0.003.\n\nFIG. 2: (a) Quadrature noise spectra of Ax and iAy , at a\nfrequency of 5 MHz, when the relative phase \u03b8 between the\nLO and the mean field mode is varied in time.

(c) Corresponding measurement\nof Ix,y (\u03b8).\n\nthat modes A+45 and A\u221245 exhibit maximal EPR-type\ncorrelations.\nMoreover, we note that our measurement not only\ndemonstrates entanglement, but also quantifies it via the\nentanglement of formation.

[10],\nwe introduce the covariance matrix (CM) \u03b3 for the \u00b145\u25e6\npolarized modes:\n\u03b3i,j = h\u03b4Ri \u03b4Rj + \u03b4Ri \u03b4Rj i/2\nwhere {Ri , i = 1, ..., 4} = {X+45 , Y+45 , X\u221245 , Y\u221245 }. Using the fact that Ax and iAy are uncorrelated and symmetrical [see Fig. 2(b) and 2(c)], it is straightforward\nto show that the \u00b145\u25e6 modes have isotropic fluctuations.\nChoosing \u03b8 = \u03b8sq , the covariance matrix can be expressed\nin the standard form given in Ref. [10]\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nn 0 k 0\n\uf8ec 0 n 0 \u2212k \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\u03b3=\uf8ec\n(6)\n\uf8edk 0 n 0 \uf8f8\n0 \u2212k 0 n\nwith n = \u22062 X\u00b145 = \u22062 Y\u00b145 and k = h\u03b4X+45 \u03b4Y\u221245 i =\nh\u03b4X\u221245 \u03b4Y+45 i [15]. As calculated by Giedke et al. the\nEOF E, representing the amount of pure state entanglement needed to prepare our entangled state [16], is then\ndirectly related to the inseparability criterion value by\n\nFIG. 3: Set-up for non separable beams generation. Inserting the quarter-wave plates (or not) allows for measuring the\nfluctuations of S3\u03b1 + S3\u03b2 (or S2\u03b1 + S2\u03b2 ). The servo loop is used\nto lock the B field phase to the squeezed quadrature angle.\n\nLast, we show that this quadrature entangled beam allows to generate polarization entanglement. Polarization\nentanglement for two beams \u03b1 and \u03b2 [5] is achieved when\nS\nI\u03b1,\u03b2\n=\n\n1 2 \u03b1\n[\u2206 (S2 + S2\u03b2 ) + \u22062 (S3\u03b1 + S3\u03b2 )] < |hS1\u03b1 i| + |hS1\u03b2 i|\n2\n\nwhere the Si\u03b1,\u03b2 are the standard quantum Stokes operators. For this, we produce new modes by mixing the A\u00b145\nmodes studied previously with additional strong fields.\nThe A\u00b145 modes are obtained from the x, y modes by\npassing the beam through a half-wave plate with axes at\n22, 5\u25e6. The fields along the x and y directions are now\nthe A+45 and A\u221245 fields, that we will denote by A\u2032x and\nA\u2032y [see Fig. 3]. The A\u2032x and A\u2032y are then spatially separated with a polarizing beamsplitter. In the other input\nof the beamsplitter, we send a strong field B with a polarization at 45\u25e6 from the beamsplitter axes, yielding the\noutput fields By and Bx . The strong field B is similar\nto the local oscillator in the previous experiment, except\nthat its phase \u03b8B is locked to that of one of the A fields\nby a servo-loop, as shown in Fig. 3. At the two outputs\nof the beamsplitter, we have two beams \u03b1, \u03b2 which are\nthe superposition of, respectively, A\u2032x and By , and A\u2032y\nand Bx . The Stokes operators Si\u03b1 for one of the outputs\nare then\n\u2032\n\u2020\nS0\u03b1 = A\u2032\u2020\nx Ax + By By\n\u2020 \u2032\nS2\u03b1 = A\u2032\u2020\nx By + By Ax\n\n\u2032\n\u2020\nS1\u03b1 = A\u2032\u2020\nx Ax \u2212 By By\n\nS3\u03b1 = i(By\u2020\u2032 A\u2032x \u2212 A\u2032\u2020\nx By )\n\n\f4\nusing the appropriate combination [5] of plates and PBS.\nIn Fig. , we present the normalized quadrature noises of\nS2\u03b1 + S2\u03b2 and S3\u03b1 + S3\u03b2 for an analysis frequency of 5 MHz.\nThis entanglement between the beams corresponds to a\nreduction by approximately 5% in the noise of each variS\nable: I\u03b1,\u03b2\n/|\u03b1B |2 = 1.9, consistently with the quadrature\nentanglement measurement. From (8-9), it is also clear\nthat the CM has the same form as (6).\n\nFIG. 4: Normalized noises at 5 MHz of S2\u03b1 + S2\u03b2 (a) and\nS3\u03b1 + S3\u03b2 (b), the phase \u03b8B being locked with the value of the\nsqueezed quadrature angle \u03b8sq .\n\nThe Stokes operators Si\u03b2 for the other output are obtained by exchanging A' and B in the previous expression. Since the B field is much stronger than the A\nfield, one has |\u03b1B | \u226b |\u03b1A\u2032 |, with \u03b1B the amplitude of\nBx and By and \u03b1A\u2032 the amplitude of A\u2032x and A\u2032y . Then\nhS1\u03b1 i = \u2212hS1\u03b2 i \u2243 \u2212|\u03b1B |2 and the inseparability condition\nreads\nS\n< 2|\u03b1B |2\nI\u03b1,\u03b2\n\n(7)\n\nIn this case the Stokes parameters fluctuations are related\nto those of the initial \u00b145\u25e6 modes (now denoted A\u2032x , A\u2032y )\n\u03b4S2\u03b1 = \u03b1B \u03b4Xx\u2032 (\u03b8B ),\n\n\u03b4S2\u03b2 = \u03b1B \u03b4Xy\u2032 (\u03b8B )\n\n(8)\n\n\u03b4S3\u03b1\n\n\u03b4S3\u03b2\n\n(9)\n\n=\n\n\u2212\u03b1B \u03b4Yx\u2032 (\u03b8B ),\n\n=\n\n\u03b1B \u03b4Yy\u2032 (\u03b8B )\n\nwhich straightforwardly lead to\nS\nI\u03b1,\u03b2\n= |\u03b1B |2 IA\u2032x ,A\u2032y (\u03b8B ) \u2261 |\u03b1B |2 I+45,\u221245 (\u03b8B )\n\nThe polarization entanglement condition (7) is thus\nequivalent to the inseparability criterion (5) for the \u00b145\u25e6\nmodes when \u03b8B = \u03b8sq . Therefore, quadrature entanglement can be mapped into a polarization basis and lead\nto polarization entanglement [6]. Experimentally, we use\nthe set-up shown in Fig. 3 and lock the phase of the B\nfield with the squeezed quadrature angle. We then successively measure the S2 and S3 Stokes operator noises\n\nTo conclude, we have reported the generation of continuous variable entanglement via the interaction with cold\natoms in cavity. First, we have developed a method to directly measure the inseparability criterion [8] and demonstrated quadrature entanglement between two orthogonally polarized modes. The entanglement was quantified\nusing the entanglement of formation calculated in Ref.\n[10]. Secondly, we achieve polarization entanglement after mapping the quadrature entanglement onto two spatially separated beams.\nThis work was supported by the QIPC European\nProject No. IST-1999-13071 (QUICOV).\n\n[1] C.H.
