The invisible axion\nowes its origin to a global U (1)P Q (Peccei-Quinn, PQ) symmetry which is spontaneously broken in the\nearly universe and explicitly broken to a discrete ZN symmetry by instanton effects at the QCD phase\ntransition [9]. The breaking occurs at a temperature TP Q below which the symmetry is nonlinearly\nrealized. Strings and domain walls relics, which are typical of axion models and are a problem in\nordinary PQ cosmology, can be avoided by introducing inflation to account for their dilution, or by\nembedding the model into more general constructions based on theories of Grand Unification [10].\nThe almost massless nature of the axion and its suppressed coupling to the fields of the Standard\nModel are consequences of the fact that this field is associated with the phase of a global anomalous\nsymmetry. Both properties are related to the same scale, the axion decay constant fa \u223c 1010 \u2212 1012\nGeV.\nThe implications of the PQ axion in cosmology, both in supersymmetric and in non supersymmetric\nmodels, have been explored to a finer level of detail. For instance, the axion plays an important role in\ndetermining the structure of the primordial perturbations [11, 12, 13], where it can act as a curvaton.\nThe gauging of an anomalous symmetry has some important effects on the properties of this\npseudoscalar, first among all the appearance of independent mass and couplings to the gauge fields.\nThis scenario allows a wider region of parameter space where to look for these particles. For this\nreason, axion-like fields, which are at the center of several investigations, are unlikely to find any\nsignificant and fundamental formulation without an underlying anomalous U (1) gauge symmetry, as\nemphasized in previous works [14, 15], [16].\nSo far only two complete models have been put forward for a consistent analysis of these types of\nparticles, the MLSOM [17] and the USSM-A [18]. The first of them is at the basis of the elaborations\nthat we are going to provide in this work. Here we will be focusing on the phenomenological analysis\nof a scenario which is a direct consequence of the model introduced in [17], while more details on the\nsupersymmetric construction will be discussed in a separate work.\nAlthough the natural framework that motivates these constructions is open string theory [19], the\neffective actions describing these types of particles can be consistently defined at lower energy just\nby the inclusion of the relevant dimension-5 Wess-Zumino (Peccei-Quinn) interactions. These are\nnecessary in order to guarantee the gauge invariance of the effective action and can be interpreted as\ncounterterms. In fact, they balance the anomalous variation of the 1-loop effective action induced by\nthe extra U (1) symmetry, restoring the gauge symmetry.\nThe gauging of an anomalous symmetry is the essential element in the construction of these\neffective actions and can be justified within intersecting brane models. The gauging is a variant of the\nstandard Peccei-Quinn construction and is characterized by a new scale M , which is the St\u00fcckelberg\n2\n\n\fmass. We recall that St\u00fcckelberg extensions of the Standard Model with a non-anomalous U (1) have\nbeen analyzed in several recent works [20, 21, 22].\nWe are going to provide a physical perspective on the possible phenomenological implications of\nthe anomalous case. In particular, we will try to connect the St\u00fcckelberg fields, which are in the\nspectrum of these models, to the physical axion which may appear as an extremely weakly interacting\nparticle of a certain relic density in our current universe. Our assumption, in the identification of\nthe physical axion, is that the original St\u00fcckelberg fields will mix at the electroweak phase transition\nwith the Higgs sector. As a result, an almost massless state will emerge after the electroweak phase\ntransition.\nOne of the key mechanisms that we will try to adapt and extend from the PQ case is that of vacuum\nmisalignment. This phenomenon occurs whenever a quasi Nambu-Goldstone mode - generated by the\nbreaking of a certain symmetry - acquires non-perturbatively a small potential, lifting one flat direction\nfrom the vacuum degeneracy. For axions characterized both by an SU (2) and an SU (3) charge the\nmechanism of vacuum misalignment becomes sequential, as we are going to show.\nFrom a more general perspective, we will also try to characterize the possible role of these types of\nparticles as quintessence axions. These appear in models where the axions remain decoupled from the\ngluonic sector and their mass is purely of electroweak origin (see for instance [23]). In this case one\ntries to exploit the Nambu-Goldstone nature of these particles. The main idea behind this proposal is\nthat a phase transition around the electroweak scale can generate a small curvature in the potential,\ncapable of giving a tiny mass to this particle, smaller than the Hubble parameter at current time\n(H0 ). For this to be possible, as we are going to show, one has to search for solutions of the anomaly\nequations for an anomalous U (1) which has a vanishing mixed anomaly with the SU (3) color group.\nIn this case the only source of mass for these axions would come from the electroweak and not from\nthe QCD phase transition, and as such could be extremely small.\nIn the general models that we analyze, the anomaly equations do not allow for such a solution,\nalthough this would not exclude the possibility of finding others, in the presence of more complicated\ngauge structures, for instance in models with several U(1)'s. We will not address this specific point\nany further, leaving it as an option for future studies. Instead, we will concentrate on the general\nfeatures of an axion-like field coming from a single anomalous U (1) symmetry, characterized by the\npresence of mixed anomalies both with the SU (2) and SU (3) sectors. The phenomenological details of\nthe model are rather intricate, and have been worked out before. For this reason we have summarized\nin the next section some of their salient features, which turn out to be necessary in order to proceed\nwith a realistic estimate of the relic densities. This is the specific goal of our work.\n\n3\n\n\f2\n\nGeneral features of models with gauged axions: the St\u00fcckelberg\nfield\n\nIn this section we briefly review the main features of the class of models that we address, discussing\nspecifically the St\u00fcckelberg field b which accompanies their anomalous U (1)B symmetry. It has been\nincluded in order to clarify the origin of the anomalous gauging and to compare the roles played by the\nPQ (a) and the St\u00fcckelberg axions, which is relevant for the analysis that will follow. The structure of\nthe entire Lagrangian is discussed in [17] and has been briefly summarized, in part, in the appendix.\nIntersecting brane models are one of those constructions where these types of generalized axions\nappear [24, 25, 26]. In the case in which several stacks of branes are introduced, each stack being\nthe domain in which fields with the gauge symmetry U (N ) live, several intersecting stacks generate,\nat their common intersections, fields with the quantum numbers of all the unitary gauge groups\nof the construction, such as U (N1 ) \u00d7 U (N2 ) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 U (Nk ) = SU (N1 ) \u00d7 U (1) \u00d7 SU (N2 ) \u00d7 U (1) \u00d7\n... \u00d7 SU (Nk ) \u00d7 U (1). In realistic models, the phases of the extra U (1)'s are rearranged in terms of\nan anomaly-free generator, with an (anomaly free) hypercharge U(1) (or U (1)Y ) times extra U (1)'s\nwhich are anomalous, carrying both their own anomalies and the mixed anomalies with all the fields\nof the Standard Model.\nFor instance, a simple realization of the Standard Model is obtained by taking 3 stacks of branes:\na first stack of 3 branes, with a symmetry U (3), a second stack of 2 branes, with a symmetry U (2) and\nan extra single brane U (1), giving a gauge structure of the form SU (3) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) \u00d7 U (1) \u00d7 U (1).\nLinear combinations of the generators of the three U (1)'s allow to rewrite the entire abelian symmetry\nin the form U (1)Y \u00d7 U (1)\u2032 \u00d7 U (1)\u2032\u2032 . These rearrangements of the U (1) phases have been studied in\nthe previous literature. For instance, the original basis for the U(1)'s is also called \"the brane basis\",\nwhile the reorganization of the generators in the form of \"hypercharge plus reminder\" goes under the\nname of \"the hypercharge basis\". There are explicit assignments in the recent literature [24, 25, 27].\nThe simplest realization of the Standard Models (SM) is obtained by 2 stacks and a single brane at\ntheir intersections, giving a symmetry U (3) \u00d7 U (2) \u00d7 U (1). In this case, in the hypercharge basis, the\ngauge structure of the model can be rewritten in the form SU (3)c \u00d7 SU (2)w \u00d7 U (1)Y \u00d7 U (1)\u2032 \u00d7 U (1)\u2032\u2032 .\nWe will be using also the notation U (1)B \u00d7 U (1)C to refer to the two U (1) factors (U (1)\u2032 \u00d7 U (1)\u2032\u2032 )\nof the abelian gauge structure. As often emphasized in previous works, the two extra U(1)'s are in a\n\"broken\" phase. For instance, if we denote with B and C, the kinetic terms of these abelian anomalous\ngauge fields are given by\nLSt =\n\n1\n1\n(\u2202\u03bc b \u2212 M1 B\u03bc )2 + (\u2202\u03bc c \u2212 M2 C\u03bc )2 ,\n2\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhich is the well-known St\u00fcckelberg form. M1 and M2 are also called St\u00fcckelberg masses while b\nand c are two pseudoscalars known as St\u00fcckelberg fields (or \"St\u00fcckelberg axions\"). The St\u00fcckelberg\nsymmetry of the Lagrangian (1) is revealed by acting with gauge transformations of the gauge fields\n4\n\n\fB and C, under which their corresponding axions b and c vary by a local shift\n\u03b4B B\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc \u03b8B\n\n\u03b4b = M1 \u03b8B\n\n\u03b4C C\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc \u03b8C\n\n\u03b4c = M2 \u03b8C ,\n\nparameterized by the local gauge parameters \u03b8B and \u03b8C . In the literature, the St\u00fcckelberg symmetry\nis presented as a way to give a mass to an abelian gauge field but still preserving the gauge symmetry\nof the theory. However, a more careful look at this symmetry shows that its realization is the same\none obtained, for instance, in an abelian Higgs model when one decouples the radial excitations of the\nHiggs fields from its phase [16]. Therefore, in this respect, the symmetry does not appear to contain\nmuch novelty. However, in the effective theory which characterizes these models, the mechanism which\ngenerates the mass of the anomalous U (1)'s is unrelated to the traditional Higgs mechanism, since\nthere is no Higgs potential involved.\nThe massive anomalous gauge bosons acquire a mass through the presence of \"A \u2227 F \" couplings in\nthe effective string theory description (see for instance [28]). The starting Lagrangian of the effective\ntheory involves an antisymmetric rank-2 tensor A\u03bc\u03bd coupled to the field strength F\u03bc\u03bd of an anomalous\ngauge boson (here denoted by B)\nL = \u2212\n\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\n1\nM \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3\nH H\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 \u2212 2 F \u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd +\n\u01eb\nA\u03bc\u03bd F\u03c1\u03c3 ,\n12\n4g\n4\n\n(2)\n\nwhere\nH\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 = \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd\u03c1 + \u2202\u03c1 A\u03bc\u03bd + \u2202\u03bd A\u03c1\u03bc ,\n\nF\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc B\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd B\u03bc\n\n(3)\n\nis the kinetic term for the 2-form and g is an arbitrary constant. Beside the two kinetic terms for A\u03bc\u03bd\nand B\u03bc , the third contribution in Eq. (2) is the A \u2227 F interaction.\nThe Lagrangian is dualized by using a \"first order\" formalism, where H is treated independently\nfrom the antisymmetric field A\u03bc\u03bd . This is obtained by introducing a constraint with a Lagrangian\nmultiplier field b(x) in order to enforce the condition H = dA from the equations of motion of b, in\nthe form\nL0 = \u2212\n\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\n1\nM \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3\n1\nH H\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 \u2212 2 F \u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd \u2212\n\u01eb\nH\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 B\u03c3 + b(x) \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 \u2202\u03bc H\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 .\n12\n4g\n6\n6\n\n(4)\n\nThe appearance of a scale M in this Lagrangian is of paramount importance both in the analysis\nof the relic densities of axions generated by the dualization of this action, and in determining the\nmass of the extra anomalous U(1) gauge boson, which has been analyzed in detail in previous works\n[29]. It defines the energy region where the Green-Schwarz mechanism comes into play to cancel the\nanomaly in orientifold vacua of string theory [17]. Clearly, it is part of a far more involved field theory\nLagrangian which, in general, is not included in the field theory analysis of this mechanism, since the\nexpansion stops at operators of dimension 5. We just remark, at this point, that the appearance of\nthe St\u00fcckelberg description in theories with gauge anomalies is not limited to effective field theories\n5\n\n\fderived from strings, but it is also common to simple 2-dimensional models, such as the bosonized\nSchwinger model (see [30]).\nThe last term in (4) is necessary in order to reobtain (2) from (4). If, instead, we integrate by\nparts the last term of the Lagrangian given in (4) and solve trivially for H we find\nH \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 = \u2212\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 (M B\u03c3 \u2212 \u2202\u03c3 b) .\n\n(5)\n\nInserting this back into (4) we obtain the expression\nLA = \u2212\n\n1\n1\nF \u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 (M B\u03c3 \u2212 \u2202\u03c3 b)2\n2\n4g\n2\n\n(6)\n\nwhich is the St\u00fcckelberg form for the mass terms of B.\nThis rearrangement of the degrees of freedom, valid in a classical sense [31], and the mapping of\nthe possible physical phases of these two model theories, is an example of the connection between\nLagrangians of antisymmetric tensor fields and their dual formulations, that in this specific case is an\nabelian massive Yang-Mills theory in a St\u00fcckelberg form (see for instance the discussion in [32]).\nThe axion field generated by the dualization mechanism appears to be a Nambu-Goldstone mode,\nwhich could be absorbed by a unitary gauge choice in the (defining) St\u00fcckelberg phase of the model.\nHowever, as discussed in [17], we will allow a mixing between this mode and the Higgs sector at the\nelectroweak phase transition, by introducing an extra potential which respects the gauge symmetry\nand whose origin has been left, so far, unspecified. This mixing potential is here assumed to be of\nnon-perturbative origin and triggered at the electroweak phase transition. It is parameterized by\nconstants (\u03bbi ) which are strongly suppressed by the exponential factor (\u223c e\u2212Sinst , with Sinst the\ninstanton action), determined by the value of the action on the instanton background (for electroweak\ninstantons). We will come to discuss these points rather closely in the next sections.\nFor this reason, at low energy, the counting of the physical degrees of freedom in the pseudoscalar\nsector of the model is performed in the combined Higgs-St\u00fcckelberg phase, where a massive physical\naxion emerges from the combination of the phases of the Higgses and of the St\u00fcckelberg field. In\nmodels with several U (1)'s this construction is slightly more involved, but the result of the mixing of\nthe complex CP odd phases leaves as a remnant, also in this case, a physical axion, denoted by \u03c7 [17],\nwhose mass is controlled by the size of the Higgs-axion mixing.\nThe St\u00fcckelberg Lagrangian that we have reviewed is part of the classical action S0 which also\nincludes the remaining gauge kinetic terms of the theory at classical level, for a symmetry SU (3) \u00d7\nSU (2) \u00d7 U (1)Y . The remaining interactions can be found in the appendix.\n\n2.1\n\nCharge assignments and counterterms\n\nWe refer to the appendix for more details concerning this class of models and for our conventions,\ntogether with a brief outline of the structure of the counterterms in the effective Lagrangian.

(1) taken as their free parameters. One can immediately observe that, due to the presence, in\ngeneral, of a nonvanishing mixed anomaly of the U (1)B with both SU (2) and SU (3), the St\u00fcckelberg\naxion of the model has interactions both with the strong and the weak sectors, which support instanton\nsolutions, and therefore could acquire a mass non-perturbatively both at the electroweak and at the\nQCD phase transitions. Notice, in particular, that for a model in which \u2206q = 0, in which both\ndoublets of the Higgs sector, Hu and Hd carry the same charge under U (1)B , then the axion mass will\nnot acquire any instanton correction at the QCD phase transition. At the same time, however, it is\neasy to show that in this case the potential responsible for Higgs-axion mixing disappears. Therefore\nthe axion remains a Nambu-Goldstone mode which is completely absorbed at the electroweak phase\ntransition. In this case, obviously, there is no mechanism of vacuum misalignment for the axion field\n(b). This will contribute to the mass of the two neutral gauge bosons Z and Z \u2032 , just like all the neutral\ncomponents of the two Higgses of the model.\nThe solution of the same equations with a vanishing electroweak interactions of the St\u00fcckelberg\nB . In the presence of both a weak (C\nappears instead possible by choosing qLB = \u22123qQ\nBW W ) and a\nstrong (CBgg ) counterterm, we will assume that the massless St\u00fcckelberg field b will mix with the\nscalar CP-odd sector and a physical axion (\u03c7) will emerge from this mixing with a tiny mass (m\u03c7 )\ngenerated by electroweak instantons. The corresponding potential will be rather shallow and for this\nreason this new degrees of freedom will be essentially misaligned but frozen. Its contribution to the\nrelic density will be indeed negligible and for this reason at this stage \u03c7 is extremely light, and massless\nfor all practical purposes. However, due to the presence of a coupling of this field with the strong\nsector, its mass will be significantly modified at the QCD phase transition, as in the Peccei-Quinn\ncase, with a value which will depend on the size of the St\u00fcckelberg mass M .\n\n8\n\n\ff\n\nQ\n\nuR\n\ndR\n\nL\n\neR\n\nqB\n\nB\nqQ\n\nquBR\n\nqdBR\n\nqLB\n\nqeBR\n\nf\n\nSU (3)C\n\nSU (2)L\n\nU (1)Y\n\nU (1)B\n\nQ\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1/6\n\nB\nqQ\n\nuR\n\n3\n\n1\n\n2/3\n\nB + qB\nqQ\nu\n\ndR\n\n3\n\n1\n\n\u22121/3\n\nB \u2212 qB\nqQ\nd\n\nL\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\u22121/2\n\neR\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\u22121\n\nHu\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1/2\n\nquB\n\nHd\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1/2\n\nqdB\n\nqLB\n\nqLB \u2212 qdB\n\nTable 1: Charges of the fermion and of the scalar fields\n\n3\n\nThe electroweak potential for massless fields\n\nAs in previous works [15], in the construction of the effective action we follow a bottom-up approach\nwith general charge assignments parameterized just by the set of free charges of U (1)B . These are\nshown in Fig. 1, together with the fundamental gauge structure of the Standard Model. The scalar\nsector of the anomalous abelian models that we are interested in is characterized by a rather standard\nelectroweak potential involving, in the simplest formulation, two Higgs doublets VP Q (Hu , Hd ) plus\n\u2032\none extra contribution, denoted as VP/ Q\n/ (Hu , Hd , b) or V , [17] which mixes the Higgs sector with the\nSt\u00fcckelberg axion b, needed for the restoration of the gauge invariance of the effective Lagrangian\nV = VP Q (Hu , Hd ) + VP/ Q\n/ (Hu , Hd , b).\n\n(10)\n\nThe appearance of the physical axion in the spectrum of the model takes place after that the phasedependent terms, here assumed to be of non-perturbative origin and generated at the electroweak\nphase transition, find their way in the dynamics of the model and induce a curvature on the scalar\npotential. The mixing induced in the CP-odd sector determines the presence of a linear combination\nof the St\u00fcckelberg field b and of the Goldstones of the CP-odd sector, called \u03c7, which is characterized\nby an almost flat direction. To better illustrate this point, we begin our analysis by turning to the\nordinary potential of 2 Higgs doublets,\nVP Q = \u03bc2u Hu\u2020 Hu + \u03bc2d Hd\u2020 Hd + \u03bbuu (Hu\u2020 Hu )2 + \u03bbdd (Hd\u2020 Hd )2 \u2212 2\u03bbud (Hu\u2020 Hu )(Hd\u2020 Hd ) + 2\u03bb\u2032ud |HuT \u03c42 Hd |2\n(11)\n\n9\n\n\fto which we add a second term\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\n\u2020\n\u2212igB (qu \u2212qd ) 2M\nVP/ Q\n) + \u03bb1 (Hu\u2020 Hd e\u2212igB (qu \u2212qd ) 2M )2 + \u03bb2 (Hu\u2020 Hu )(Hu\u2020 Hd e\u2212igB (qu \u2212qd ) 2M ) +\n/ = \u03bb0 (Hu Hd e\nb\n\n\u03bb3 (Hd\u2020 Hd )(Hu\u2020 Hd e\u2212igB (qu \u2212qd ) 2M ) + h.c.,\n\n(12)\n\nThese terms are allowed by the symmetry of the model and are parameterized by one dimensionful (\u03bb0 )\nand three dimensionless constants (\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , \u03bb3 ). They are assumed to be generated at the electroweak\nphase transition non-perturbatively, and as such their values are related to an exponential factor\ncontaining as a suppression\nthe instanton action. In the equations below we will rescale \u03bb0 by the\nq\n2\nelectroweak scale v = vu + vd2 (\u03bb0 \u2261 \u03bb\u03040 v) so to obtain a homogeneous expression of the mass of \u03c7 as\na function of the relevant scales of the model which are, beside the electroweak vev v, the St\u00fcckelberg\nmass M and the anomalous gauge coupling of the U (1)B , gB .\nThe physical axion \u03c7 emerges as a linear combination of the phases of the various terms, which\nare either due to the components of the Higgs sector or to the St\u00fcckelberg field b. To illustrate the\nappearance of a physical direction in the phase of the extra potential, we focus our attention just on\nthe CP-odd sector of the total potential, which is the only one that is relevant for our discussion.

This scale is the product of two contributions: a 1/M suppression coming from the\noriginal Wess-Zumino counterterm of the Lagrangian (b/M F F\u0303 ) and a factor v/M obtained by the\nprojection of b into \u03c7 due to O\u03c7 .\nMore details on the structure of the various operators appearing in this model have been included\nin an appendix in order to make our treatment self-contained. We have included also a brief discussion\nof the construction of g\u03c7\u03b3\u03b3 , which is the factor in front of one of the most important counterterms\nneeded in our numerical analysis and which controls the decay of the axion into photons.

O A is the matrix that rotates the neutral gauge bosons from the\ninteraction to the mass eigenstates after electroweak symmetry breaking and has elements which are\nO(1), being expressed in terms of ratios of coupling constants. They correspond to mixing angles.\nThe coefficients F and CY Y are the W Z counterterms for cancelling the anomalies emerging from the\nSU (2)U (1)2B and U (1)B U (1)2Y sectors and can be found in the appendix. They are both suppressed\n11\n\n\f\u03c7\nby 1/M , while the matrix element O33\n, as we have mentioned, is of order v/M .

To identify the corresponding phase in\nthe Higgs-neutral CP-odd sector we introduce a polar parametrization of the neutral components in\nthe broken electroweak phase\nHu0\n\n\u0011 F\u221au0 (x)\n1 \u0010\u221a\ni\n0\n2vu + \u03c1u (x) e 2vu\n=\u221a\n2\n\nHd0\n\n\u0011 i F\u221ad0 (x)\n1 \u0010\u221a\n0\n2vd + \u03c1d (x) e 2vd ,\n=\u221a\n2\n\n(22)\n\nwhere we have introduced the two phases Fu and Fd of the two neutral Higgs fields.

In our case \u03c3\u03c7 , however, is of the order of the\nelectroweak scale. This, as we are going to show, has drastic implications on the relic densities of\naxions generated at this transition.\nNotice that \u03c7 (or, equivalently, \u03b8) is gauge invariant as one can check quite directly. In fact a U (1)B\n\n12\n\n\finfinitesimal gauge transformation with gauge parameter \u03b1B (x) gives\ni\n\u03b4Hu = \u2212 qu gB \u03b1B Hu\n2\ni\n\u03b4Hd = \u2212 qd gB \u03b1B Hd\n2\nvu\n\u03b4F0u = \u2212 \u221a qu gB \u03b1B\n2\nvd\nd\n\u03b4F0 = \u2212 \u221a qd gB \u03b1B\n2\n\u03b4b = \u2212M \u03b1B\n\n(26)\n\ngiving \u03b4\u03b8 = 0. The gauge invariance under U (1)Y can be easily proven by using the invariance of\nthe St\u00fcckelberg field b and the fact that the hypercharges of the two Higgses are equal. Finally, the\ninvariance under SU (2) is obvious since the linear combination of the phases that define \u03b8(x) are not\ntouched by the transformation. From the Peccei-Quinn breaking potential we can extract the following\nperiodic potential\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0001\n\u03c7\n\u03c7\n2\n2\n\u2032\n2 2\nV =4vu vd \u03bb2 vd + \u03bb3 vu + \u03bb0 cos\n+ 2\u03bb1 vu vd cos 2\n,\n(27)\n\u03c3\u03c7\n\u03c3\u03c7\nwith a mass for the physical axion \u03c7 given by\nm2\u03c7 =\n\n\u0001\n2vu vd\n2\n2\n2\n\u2248 \u03bbv 2 .\n\u03bb\u0304\nv\n+\n\u03bb\nv\n+\n\u03bb\nv\n+\n4\u03bb\nv\nv\n0\n2\n3\n1\nu\nd\nu\nd\n\u03c3\u03c72\n\n(28)\n\nNotice that, according to our assumption about the origin of the extra potential, this is driven\nby the combined product of non-perturbative effects, due to the exponentially small parameters\n(\u03bb \u03040 , \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , \u03bb3 ), with the electroweak vevs of the two Higgses. Notice also the irrelevance of the\nSt\u00fcckelberg scale M in determining the value of \u03c3\u03c7 \u223c O(v) and of m\u03c7 near the transition region,\ndue to the large suppression factor \u03bb in Eq. (28). One point that needs to be stressed is the fact that\nat the electroweak epoch the angle of misalignment generated by the extra potential is parameterized\nby \u03c7/\u03c3\u03c7 while the interaction of the physical axion with the gauge fields is suppressed by M 2 /v.\nThis feature is obviously unusual, since in the PQ case both scales are a single scale, the axion decay\nconstant fa .\nWe will consider in the next sections two possible scenarios, the first is the low gravity scenario,\nwhere M 2 /v is in the TeV region or above, but essentially disconnected from the typical scale appearing\nin typical PQ axion models (fa \u223c 1012 GeV). In the second scenario we will allow a very large value\nfor M 2 /v, of the same order of fa . In this second case we will re-obtain the PQ axion model, with\nrelic densities for \u03c7 which are comparable with those typical of a PQ axion. The appearance of\na misalignment angle of the form \u03c7/\u03c3\u03c7 , respect to the PQ case (a/fa ), is going to have drastic\nconsequences on the relic densities of this particle generated at the electroweak scale, densities which\nwill be found to be negligible.\n13\n\n\fAt the QCD phase transition a new - much more sizeable - misalignment occurs and the axion\nmass gets enhanced by the QCD instantons respect to m\u03c7 given in (28), which in this case is typically\nof O(\u039b2QCD v/M 2 ). Notice that at the QCD phase transition M 2 /v takes the same role of fa in PQ\n(in the PQ case ma \u223c \u039b2QCD /fa )).\nThere are also some crucial points of difference between a gauged axion and the PQ case that require\nsome comment, since they are not so obvious. Notice, in fact, that in the PQ case, if vP Q is larger\nthan the scale of inflation, then the value of the \u03b8 field can be considered essentially homogeneous.\nWe have already mentioned that in the PQ case \u03b8 is a physical field at every physical scale, since it\nis a Nambu-Goldstone mode of a global U (1) symmetry and as such cannot be gauged away. In that\ncase the role of the mechanism of vacuum misalignment at the QCD transition is just to provide a\nmass for this Goldstone mode.\nIn our case, instead, b has no potential and is charged under an anomalous gauge symmetry. As\nsuch it appears as a longitudinal component of the anomalous gauge boson B, above the electroweak\nscale. This also implies that there is no effect on b due to inflation, being the St\u00fcckelberg not a\nphysical field at the scale of inflation. Thus, the reappearance in the CP-odd sector of a component\nof b as a physical axion, \u03c7, at the electroweak phase transition, implies that this physical component\nis not a homogeneous field at the electroweak time. Similar types of inhomogeneities are found also\nin the PQ case, in models characterized by late inflation. In fact, in that case the homogeneity of the\naxion field beyond the QCD horizon is not guarantee either.\nFor this reason, it is conceivable that \u03c7 is homogeneous within the electroweak horizon for the\nsame argument, and one can neglect fluctuations of \u03c7 that enter the horizon at later times. Anyhow,\neven if these fluctuations were included, they are likely to play a minor role respect to other, more\nsignificant effects, such as those determined by the size of the St\u00fcckelberg mass M (M 2 /v), which\nhas a dominant impact on the value of the relic densities for these types of axions. For this reason\nwe will be leaving aside possible further corrections due to a non-homogeneity of the b field beyond\nthe electroweak horizon, knowing that variants of this approach could be worked out following the\ndiscussion given in [33].\n\n4\n\nDecays of axion-like particles\n\nThe physical axion acquires a non-vanishing coupling with the massive fermions that is proportional to\nthe rotation matrix O \u03c7 and to the mass of the fermion. This coupling increases the number of its decay\nmodes and, in particular, induces new channels in its decay rate into gauge bosons, mediated both by\nfermion loops and by direct Wess-Zumino interactions. In this section we perform a complete study of\nthe decay rate under the assumption that the mass of \u03c7 is in the meV region and below. In particular,\nin the case of a very light axi-Higgs, the decays into massless vector bosons are all dominated by the\nWess-Zumino contributions, which are far larger than those coming from the fermion loops. These\n\n14\n\n\fresults will be used in the study of the relic densities of this particle which will be presented in the\nnext sections. Here we compare the results of the decay rates for the new axions with those of the the\nPQ axion that we are going to compute from scratch.\nThe interaction of the PQ axion with photons is given by\nLint\n\ne2 ca\u03b3\u03b3\n=\naF F\u0303 + . . . ,\n32\u03c0 2 fa\n\n(29)\n\nwhere we denote with a the axion, which is bounded (from astrophysical and cosmological constraints)\nto be between 108 GeV \u2264 fa \u2264 1012 GeV. The dots in the previous formula indicate terms that are\nirrelevant for the current analysis. From a general point of view, the coefficient ca\u03b3\u03b3 depends upon the\nPeccei-Quinn charge assignment and also on the quark-mass ratios induced by its fermion interactions.\nThe coupling to the fermions is given by\nLf = igf\n\nmf  \u0304 5\n\u03c8f \u03b3 \u03c8f ,\nvP Q\n\n(30)\n\nwhere mf is the mass of the fermion, whose flavor is denoted by f , and the coupling gf = QfR \u2212 QfL\nQ\nis given in terms of the chiral PQ charges (QPf L,R\n) of each fermion (f ). We denote with vP Q the PQ\nbreaking scale, which can be taken approximately around 1015 GeV. We recall that in the PQ case\nthe corresponding Wess-Zumino interaction is given by\nLa\u03b3\u03b3 =\n\nGa\u03b3\u03b3\n~ * B,\n~\na F \u03bc\u03bd F\u0303\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212Ga\u03b3\u03b3 a E\n4\n\n(31)\n\n~ and B\n~ are the electric and magnetic fields respectively, and the coupling Ga\u03b3\u03b3 is the sum of\nwhere E\na model dependent term and of a second term which depends on the ratio of the quark masses\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nX\n\u03b1em \uf8ed\n2 4 + z\uf8f8\n2\nGa\u03b3\u03b3 =\n,\n(32)\nQPf Q (Qem\nf ) \u2212\n2\u03c0fa\n31+z\nf\n\nwhere the quark-mass ratio is z = mu /md , while the Qem\nf 's are the e.m. couplings of the photons\nto the quarks. Since the coefficient Ga\u03b3\u03b3 is model dependent, we can have several possibilities. We\ncompute below the decay rate into two photons in one specific case in which we assume\nca\u03b3\u03b3 =\n\nX\n\n2\nQPf Q (Qem\nf ) =0\n\n(33)\n\nf\n\nand z = 0.56. This choice gives as a decay rate into two photons\n\u0393a\u03b3\u03b3 =\n\n\u0010 m \u00115\nG2a\u03b3\u03b3 3\na\n,\nma = 1.1 \u00d7 10\u221224 s\u22121\n64\u03c0\neV\n\n(34)\n\nwhich is a function of the axion mass ma .

We show the results of this\ncomparative study in Fig. 3, where in the left panel we present results for the decay rates of \u03c7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\nfor several values of the axion mass as a function of tan \u03b2 = vu /vd . The plots indicate a very mild\ndependence of the rates on this parameter, even for rather large variations. In the same plot the rates\nfor the PQ case are shown as constant lines, just for comparison. Notice that we have chosen a rather\n\n17\n\n\flow St\u00fcckelberg mass, with M = 1 TeV. The charge assignment of the anomalous model have been\ndenoted as f (\u22121, 1, 4), where we have used the convention\nB\nB\nf (qQ\n, qLB , \u2206q B ) \u2261 (qQ\n, quBR ; qdBR , qLB , qeBR , quB , qdB ).\nL\nL\n\n(43)\n\nB , q B , \u2206q B .

One can immediately\nobserve that the rates for the PQ case are smaller than those for the St\u00fcckelberg by a factor of\n1020 \u2212 1012 , nevertheless the axi-Higgs \u03c7 has a lifetime which is much bigger than the current age of\nthe universe.\nConcerning the possibility to detect the axion through its two-photon decay channel, its tiny mass\nand the smaller value of its lifetime unfortunately do not allow to set significant constraints on its\npossible parameter space. The situation, in this case, if rather different from that of other dark\nmatter candidates, such as, for instance, the gravitinos, which have been widely investigated recently\n[34, 35, 36]. In fact, the allowed parameter space where the constraints derived from those previous\nstudies apply, concern a region in the plane (\u03c4DM , mDM ) - with \u03c4DM being the lifetime of a generic\ndark matter particle and mDM its mass - which is bounded by the intervals 1026 s < \u03c4DM < 1035 s\nand 10\u22125 GeV < mDM < 102 GeV. While the value of \u03c4\u03c7 for the axion can reasonably reach the lower\nedge of the scanned region in \u03c4DM , by an adjustment of its coupling gB and charge assignments of\nthe anomalous U (1), its mass is definitely too small to be excluded by these types of analysis. These\nstudies are, obviously, very interesting for candidates of heavier mass, such as gravitinos. Similar\nconsiderations apply in the case of LHC studies, given the small production rates for a very light\naxion. For much heavier axions, instead, these types of studies have been performed quite recently\n[16], but the behaviour of this particle, in this case, is akin a light Higgs rather than a long-lived light\npseudoscalar.\n\n5\n\nRelic density at the electroweak and at the QCD phase transitions\n\nIn this section we proceed with the derivation of the relic densities for \u03c7 both at the electroweak and\nat the QCD phase transitions.\nAt the electroweak scale, we will assume that the flat direction parameterized by the St\u00fcckelberg\naxion b is lifted by electroweak instanton corrections. A similar phenomenon, but much more sizeable,\n18\n\n\fclearly will take place at the QCD phase transition. As we have discussed previously, at the electroweak\nscale, a mixing between the various phases of the non-perturbative potential allows to identify the\nlinear combination \u03c7 as the physical axion. In general, this is misaligned with respect to the minimum\nof the potential generated at this transition, with a misalignment that, as we have pointed out, is\nparameterized by the value \u03b8 = \u03c7/\u03c3\u03c7 .\nThe analysis of the relic density around the electroweak scale is then performed rather straightforwardly, following a standard approach borrowed from the PQ case. For this goal, we define the\nabundance variable of \u03c7\nY\u03c7 (Ti ) \u2261\n\nn\u03c7\ns\n\n(45)\nTi\n\nwhere Ti is the oscillation temperature, which is close to the electroweak scale. The universe must be\n(at least) as old as the required period of oscillation in order for the axion field to start oscillating and\nto appear as dark matter, otherwise \u03b8 is misaligned but frozen. This is the content of the condition\nm\u03c7 (Ti ) = 3H(Ti ),\n\n(46)\n\nbetween the mass of axion at the oscillation temperature Ti (m\u03c7 (Ti )), and the Hubble parameter at\nthe same temperature H(Ti ). The condition for oscillation Eq. (46) allows to express the axion mass\nat T = Ti in terms of the effective massless degrees of freedom evaluated at the same temperature,\nthat is\nr\nT2\n4 3\nm\u03c7 (Ti ) =\n\u03c0 g\u2217,Ti i .\n(47)\n5\nMP\nExpressed in terms of the initial angle of misalignment \u03b8i , Eq. 45 becomes\n45\u03c3\u03c72 \u03b8i2\nY\u03c7 (Ti ) = p\n,\n2 5\u03c0g\u2217,Ti Ti MP\n\n(48)\n\nwhere g\u2217,T = 110.75 is the number of massless degrees of freedom of the model at the electroweak\nscale. Using the conservation of the abundance Ya0 = Ya (Ti ), the expression of the contribution to\nthe relic density is given by\ns0\nn\u03c7\nm\u03c7 .\n(49)\n\u03a9mis\n=\n\u03c7\ns Ti\n\u03c1c\nThe values of the critical energy density (\u03c1c ) and the entropy density today are estimated as\n\u03c1c = 5.2 * 10\u22126 GeV/cm3\n\ns0 = 2970 cm\u22123 ,\n\n(50)\n\nwith \u03b8 \u2243 1. Given these values, the relic density as a function of tan \u03b2 is given in Fig. 4. We have\nvaried the oscillation mass and plotted the relic densities as a function of tan \u03b2. The variation of vu has\nbeen constrained to give the values of the masses of the electroweak gauge bosons, via an appropriate\nchoice of tan \u03b2.\n19\n\n\fFigure 4: Relic density of the axi-Higgs as a function of tan \u03b2\n\nFor instance, if we assume a temperature of oscillation of Ti = 100 GeV, an upper bound for the\naxi-Higgs mass, which allows the oscillations to take place, is m\u03c7 (Ti ) \u2248 10\u22125 eV, with g\u2217,T \u2248 100.\nIn order to specify \u03c3\u03c7 we have assumed a value of 1 TeV for the St\u00fcckelberg mass M , with\ngB \u2248 1, and we have taken (qu , qd ) of order unity, obtaining \u03c3\u03c7 \u2243 102 GeV. As we lower the oscillation\ntemperature (and hence the mass), the corresponding curves for \u03a9\u03c7 are down-shifted.\nThe values of these relic densities at current time are basically vanishing and these small results\nare to be attributed to the value of \u03c3\u03c7 , which is bound to vary around the electroweak scale.\nJust to compare with the PQ case, there \u03c3\u03c7 is replaced by the large scale fa at the QCD phase\ntransition, and this is the reason of such a strong suppression for \u03a9\u03c7 (or of an enhancement, in the PQ\ncase). Instanton effects at the electroweak scale are expected, in our case, to provide a mass of the type\nm2\u03c7 \u223c \u039b4ew /v 2 , with \u039b4ew \u223c Exp(\u22122\u03c0/\u03b1w (v))v 4 - \u03b1W (v) being the weak charge at the scale v - which\nis indeed a rather small value since Exp(\u22122\u03c0/\u03b1w (v)) \u223c e\u2212198 . For this reason \u03c7 remains essentially\na physical but frozen degree of freedom which may undergo a significant (second) misalignment only\nat the QCD phase transition. If not for the presence of a coupling of the axion to the gluons, via the\ncolor/ U (1)B mixed anomaly, \u03c7 could be classified as a quintessence axion, contributing to the dark\nenergy content.\n\n5.1\n\nThe QCD phase transition\n\nWe have seen that the electroweak phase transition has redefined the phase of \u03c7 via the mixing with the\nCP-odd Higgs sector, but below the electroweak scale the field remains essentially a pseudo Nambu-\n\n20\n\n\fGoldstone mode which undergoes the second misalignment induced by the QCD phase transition,\nquite similarly to an ordinary PQ axion. Neglecting the small mass of m\u03c7 induced at the electroweak\nscale, the new mass induced at the QCD scale is controlled by the ratio m\u03c7 \u223c \u039b2QCD v/M 2 , where now\nthe angle of misalignment is essentially related to the St\u00fcckelberg mass M , via M 2 /v (which replaces\n\u03c3\u03c7 ), and is now given by \u03b8 \u2032 \u2261 \u03c7v/M 2 .\nIn order to further clarify this point it is convenient to follow the analogy with the PQ case and\nobserve that M 2 /v replaces fa in characterizing the coupling of the physical axion \u03c7 to the gluons.\nAt the same time M , just like fa , can be interpreted as a symmetry breaking scale, given the presence\nof a derivative coupling (M \u2202b * B) of the anomalous gauge boson B to the St\u00fcckelberg field b in the\nSt\u00fcckeberg mass term. Thus it can be naturally interpreted, in this phase, as originating from a vev\nof an extra scalar singlet to which B couples in the UV. These two elements clearly indicate that the\nnew misalignment is basically given by \u03b8 \u2032 .\nGiven the similarity between this situation and the PQ case, then we can follow standard arguments\nto estimate the mass of \u03c7 after the QCD transition. Thus, we just recall that for PQ axions [3, 37]\nthe zero temperature mass is given by\n\u221a\nN\nz f \u03c0 m\u03c0\nma = N\n= 6.2\n\u03bceV\n(51)\n1 + z fa\nfa,12\nwhere z \u2243 0.56 is the ratio of the up and down quark masses, f\u03c0 and m\u03c0 are the pion decay constant\nand mass, fa is the axion decay constant, fa,12 is the same constant expressed in units of 1012 GeV and\nN is the U (1)P Q color anomaly index. The dependence of the Peccei-Quinn axion on the temperature\ncan be expressed as\n(\n\u00014\nma d T\u039b\nT >\u039b\nma (T ) =\n(52)\nma\nT < \u039b,\nwhere d is a model dependent numerical factor and \u039bQCD \u2248 0.2 GeV is the scale of the QCD phase\ntransition. We have also set d = 0.018 [38].\nWe can borrow this formula to determine the mass of \u03c7 at zero temperature (m\u03c7 (T = 0) \u223c ma )\nand extend it to finite T (m\u03c7 (T ) \u223c ma (T )), using the same expression (52) valid in the case of the PQ\naxion. Coming to the value of the abundances, with the replacement of \u03c3 \u2192 M 2 /v, Eq. 48 assumes\nthe form\n\u00012\n45 M 2 /v (\u03b8 \u2032 (Ti ))2\np\nY\u03c7 (Ti ) =\n,\n(53)\n2 5\u03c0g\u2217,T Ti MP\nbeing the exact analogue of the PQ expression for the abundances of the invisible axion, with fa \u2192\nM 2 /v. Concerning g\u2217,T , the effective massless degrees of freedom at T \u2243 1 GeV are those of the gluons,\nthe photon, 2 charged leptons, 3 neutrinos and 3 quark flavors; thus we have g\u2217,1GeV = 61.75. At the\nQCD phase transition, that is at T \u2243 200 MeV, the effective massless degrees of freedom are given by\nthe photon, 1 charged leptons and 3 neutrinos, giving g\u2217,\u039b = 10.75. The oscillation temperature can\n\n21\n\n\fbe obtained from Eq. 47\nTi6\n\n=\n\ns\n\n5\nm\u03c7 (0)MP b\u039b4QCD ,\n4\u03c0 3 g\u2217,Ti\n\n(54)\n\nfrom which we get Ti \u2248 0.6 GeV and a typical oscillation mass which is given by m\u03c7 (Ti ) \u2248 1.4 neV.\nValues of m\u03c7 larger than this typical value will allow oscillations of the field \u03c7 and the appearance\nof relic densities whose size is essentially controlled by the value of M , the St\u00fcckelberg mass, via the\nscale M 2 /v.\nGiven the analogy between M 2 /v and fa and the dependence of the axion field amplitudes on\nthese two scales, it is natural to expect that only for large values of M one should expect a significant\ncontribution to the relic density of these new axions.\nWe show in Fig. 5 results of a numerical study of \u03a9mis h2 as a function of M , expressed in units of\n109 GeV. We show as a darkened area the bound coming from WMAP data [39], given as the average\nvalue plus an error band, while the monotonic curve denotes the values of \u03a9mis h2 as a function of M .\nIt is clear that the relic density of \u03c7 can contribute significantly to the dark matter content only if\nthe St\u00fcckelberg scale is rather large (\u223c 107 GeV) and negligible otherwise. A final comment concerns\nthe role of the isocurvature perturbations, which are generated by inflation, in these types of models,\nsince in the case of the PQ axion they provide significant constraints on the possible values of fa . The\nfact that the b field does not correspond to a physical degree of freedom during inflation allows to\nbypass completely these constraints. They do not apply to these types of axions and this represents\na very interesting feature and a significant variant of these models respect to the PQ case.\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have discussed the most salient cosmological features of models containing gauged axions, obtained\nfrom the gauging of an anomalous symmetry. The gauging allows to define a consistent theory for\naxion-like particles, which generalize many of the properties of PQ axions. They have appeared for\nthe first time in the study of intersecting branes, but their features are quite generic. They are\nconstructed as effective theories containing minimal gauge interactions which restore gauge invariance\nof the effective action in the presence of an anomalous U (1) symmetry, and no further requirements.\nDifferently from the PQ case, here there is no concept of an original PQ symmetry, broken at a\nvery large scale, with the axion taking the role of a Goldstone mode that acquires a mass at the QCD\nphase transition. Rather, the physical axion emerges directly at the electroweak phase transition, when\nHiggs-axion mixing occurs. Being charged under SU (3) and SU (2), we have a sequential misalignment\nof this field, and we have quantified its relic density as a function of the St\u00fcckelberg mass. We have\nshown that only very large values of the St\u00fcckelberg mass cause a significant contribution of this type\nof axions to the current dark matter content of the Universe, which otherwise remains negligible. The\nabsence of an original PQ-like potential has some implications at cosmological level, such as the absence\n\n22\n\n\fFigure 5: Relic density of the axi-Higgs as a function of M . The grey bar represents the measured value of\n\u03a9DM h2 = 0.1123 \u00b1 0.0035\n\nof isocurvature perturbations, since the St\u00fcckelberg is not a physical mode before the electroweak phase\ntransition, in particular at the time of inflation. This feature is due to the presence of a local gauge\nsymmetry, realized in the St\u00fcckelberg form, which allows to absorb b into the longitudinal component\nof the anomalous gauge boson.\nOur analysis represents, more generally, a description of the fate of the St\u00fcckelberg field in cosmology, from the defining St\u00fcckelberg phase of the theory at a large scale (defined by the value of\nthe St\u00fcckelberg mass), down to the electroweak and QCD phase transitions, when this field develops a physical component. Our analysis could be extended in several directions, for instance with\nthe inclusion of the modifications induced on the computation of the relics due to the presence of\nnon-homogeneities in \u03c7 beyond the QCD horizon, a feature which is also present in PQ models when\nthe PQ scale lays below the scale of inflation. However, even at this level of refinement, the only\nsignificant scale in the determination of the relic densities remains the value of the St\u00fcckelberg mass.\nSmall values of this mass parameter in the TeV range leave the contribution of these particles to the\nrelic densities of dark matter negligible, and sizeable for M around an intermediate scale of 107 GeV.\nIn this case all the constraints coming from the neutral current sector are satisfied, being the extra\nZ \u2032 of the theory completely decoupled from the low energy spectrum of the Standard Model. The\nappearance of this intermediate scale is a novel feature of this type of axions which could be used to\n23\n\n\fset limits on their parameter space.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Pierre Sikivie and Nikos Irges for discussions.

The model, definitions and conventions\n\nWe summarize in this section some results concerning the model with a single anomalous U (1) discussed\nin the main sections.\nThe effective action has the structure given by\nS = S0 + SY uk + San + SW Z + SCS\n\n(55)\n\nwhere S0 is the classical action. It contains the usual gauge degrees of freedom of the Standard Model\nplus the extra anomalous gauge boson B which is already massive, before electroweak symmetry\nbreaking, via a St\u00fcckelberg mass term, reviewed in Sec. 2. Its complete expression is given in [17].\nHere we briefly describe the structure of the anomalous contributions and of the induced counterterms\nfor the restoration of gauge invariance in the 1-loop effective action.\nIn Eq. (55) the anomalous contributions coming from the 1-loop triangle diagrams involving abelian\nand non-abelian gauge interactions are summarized by the expression\nSan =\n\n1\n1\n1\nhTBW W BW W i + hTBGG BGGi + hTBBB BBBi\n2!\n2!\n3!\n1\n1\n+ hTBY Y BY Y i + hTY BB Y BBi,\n2!\n2!\n\n(56)\n\nwhere the symbols hi denote integration.

We outline the case of g\u03b3\u03b3\nand its relation to the fundamental parameters/scales of\nthe theory. Among these are the St\u00fcckelberg mass M , the hypercharge and weak couplings gY and\ng2 and the charges of the fermion running inside the anomaly loops. These fix the coefficient of the\nanomalies CBY Y and CBW W (for the U (1)B U (1)2Y and SU (2)2 U (1)B anomalies) and the rotation\nmatrices of the neutral gauge bosons O A and of the CP-odd sector O \u03c7 , defined in Eq.
