The analysis of the structure of the \"short\" string expansion [2, 1] or of the\nmarginality\n\u221a condition for string vertex operators [1, 3] implies that the energy of such states\nfor large \u03bb may be written as\n\u221a\nb1\nb2\n1\n4\nE = 2 \u03bb + b0 + \u221a\n+ \u221a + O( \u221a\n).\n4\n4\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n( \u03bb)3\n\n(1.1)\n\nThe coefficients b1 , b2 , ... should be the same for all states in one supermultiplet with b0 being an\ninteger related to a position of a given state in the supermultiplet. As was argued in [1], for the\nKonishi multiplet b0 + 4 = \u22060 should be equal to bare (\u03bb = 0) dimension of the corresponding\ngauge-theory operator, while b1 should receive contributions only from the classical string energy\nand the string 1-loop correction to it.\nGeneric string solutions [4, 5, 6] carry global SO(2, 4) \u00d7 SO(6) charges (E, S1 , S2 ; J1 , J2 , J3 ),\ni.e. the energy and components of spins/orbital momenta in 2+3 orthogonal planes of AdS5 \u00d7S 5 .\nWhile in the standard semiclassical expansion the values of these charges are assumed to be\nof order of the string tension which is taken to be large, one may formally interpolate the\nsemiclassical results to fixed values of Sr and Ji by considering \"short\" string limit [2, 1] when\nSr = \u221aSr\u03bb \u226a 1 and Ji = \u221aJi\u03bb \u226a 1.\nEstablishing a correspondence between semiclassical string states and the dual gauge-theory\noperators is, in general, a highly non-trivial enterprise. The values of the global charges may\nbe used as a guide in constructing such a map. In particular, quantum string states and the\ndual gauge theory operators should be highest-weight states with Dynkin labels1\n[J2 \u2212 J3 , J1 \u2212 J2 , J2 + J3 ]( S1 +S2 , S1 \u2212S2 ) . For example, the singlet operator Tr(\u03a6\u0304i \u03a6i ) which is the\n2\n\n2\n\n\"ground-state\" of the Konishi multiplet [7, 8]2 corresponds to [0, 0, 0](0,0) with \u22060 = 2 while its\nsupersymmetry descendants in the sl(2) and su(2) sectors are, respectively, Tr(\u03a61 D 2 \u03a61 ) with\nS = J1 = 2 or [0, 2, 0](1,1) , and Tr([\u03a61 , \u03a62 ]2 ) with J1 = J2 = 2 or [2, 0, 2](0,0) , both with bare\ndimension \u22060 = 4.\nThe semiclassical description of string states is very crude (unless the values of all hidden\ncharges are specified, as it is the case in the integrability-based description). In particular, one\nmay not be able to distinguish between zero and finite values of spins at large string tension,\nso that it is important to have additional cross-checks. In particular, one should verify that\nthe string theory predicts universal (i.e. equal) values of anomalous dimensions for states that\nare expected to belong to the same supermultiplet. Such a universal behavior was observed in\n[1]. The states considered there formally fit (under some particular assignment of their global\ncharges) into some representations present in the Konishi multiplet table. There was, however,\n1\n\nWe follow the standard notation used in [1]: SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) labels (sL , sR ) for SO(4) and the Dynkin labels\n[p1 , q, p2 ] for SU (4) are given by sL,R = 12 (S1 \u00b1 S2 ), and p1,2 = J2 \u2213 J3 , q = J1 \u2212 J2 .\n2\nWe copy the table of its states (in the form taken from [8]) at the end of this paper.\n\n2\n\n\fonly a circumstantial evidence3 that these states correspond indeed to members of the Konishi\nmultiplet, implying that one needs some additional input or data.\nAn additional assumption used in [1] was that in identifying semiclassical spinning string\nstates with quantum\u221astring states one may use analogy with the bosonic or NSR string spectrum\nin flat space E 2 = 2 \u03bb(N \u2212 2) where N = 2, 4, ... is the maximal value of spin at a given string\nlevel (i.e. N = 2 at the massless level, N = 4 at the first excited string level, etc.). Following\nsuch pattern would suggest that one should shift the value of the total spin of a semiclassical\nstring by -2 when comparing to quantum string states. However, in describing the light-cone\nGS superstring spectrum one identifies the massless string level with the ground state not\ncarrying any genuine string oscillators: all massless (supergravity) string modes are obtained\nby quantizing the superparticle representing the point-like string limit (with the spin of the\ngraviton carried by the fermion 0-modes building the vacuum supermultiplet, etc.; the same\npicture applies in the case of the superstring in a pp-wave background [9, 10]). Then the spin\nof an extended string solution should be associated only with \"extra\" oscillators acting on the\nground state.\nIn this paper we shall use this superstring pattern when comparing semiclassical\n\u221a strings to\n2\nquantum string states, i.e. we shall assume that in the flat-space limit E = 2 \u03bbN, N =\n0, 2, ..., with the maximal spin carried by extended string motion being N. States on the first\nexcited string level N = 2 will have just two oscillators, and the resulting values of spins they\nmay carry are S1 = 2, S2 = Ji = 0, or S1 = S2 = 1, Ji = 0, or S1 = S2 = 0, J1 = 2, or\nS1 = J1 = 1, S2 = Ji = 0, or J1 = J2 = 1, Si = J3 = 0. States with such small values of spins\nwill not correspond to non-trivial states in the \"minimal\" closed sl(2) or su(2) sectors on the\ngauge theory side. Also, identification to members of the Konishi multiplet table appears to be\nambiguous.\nThere is, however, a natural resolution: instead of considering classical solutions that carry\nno orbital angular momentum J = J3 in S 5 (as was the case in [1]) one should switch on a\nminimal non-zero value of J. While having J 6= 0 will not influence the value of the string level\nit will allow for a natural identification of the corresponding semiclassical string solutions with\noperators in the sl(2) or su(2) sectors and with members in the Konishi multiplet (for J = 2).\nThus the main point of the present paper is that one should focus on the simplest extended\nstring states built \"on top\" of the BPS vacuum state with charge J = 2 (i.e. the chiral primary\noperator Tr(\u03a621 ) on the gauge theory side or a superparticle state on the string side). For this\nreason, to describe string states dual to the Konishi multiplet states here we shall consider\nsimplest string solutions that carry a (minimal) non-zero value of the S 5 orbital momentum,\ni.e. their center of mass will be orbiting a circle in S 5 .4\nAs we shall see below, the direct generalizations of the semiclassical\nstring states discussed\n\u221a\nin [1] to states that carry an additional momentum J = 2 \u226a \u03bb have their natural places in\nthe Konishi multiplet table of states.5 The corresponding value of b1 in (1.1) is shifted by the\n3\n\nFor example, one may check that in the flat space limit the small circular string states considered in [1]\napparently belong to the same supersymmetry multiplet.\n4\nAs we shall discuss below, the simplest \"short\" strings without such S 5 momentum like folded spinning\nstrings or pulsating strings with just one quantum number (for which b1 in (1.1) happens to be transcendental\n[2, 14, 15]) presumably do not to correspond to members of the Konishi multiplet.\n5\nThe state with J = 2 in the supergravity multiplet, dual to a chiral primary operator, may be described\n\n3\n\n\f\"classical\" contribution proportional to J 2 as\n1\nb1 (J) = b1 (0) + J 2 .\n(1.2)\n4\nAs the universal value of the coefficient b1 (0) found in [1] for different solutions was 1, this\nimplies then that b1 (2) = 2. This is precisely the value for the Konishi multiplet state in\nthe sl(2) sector (having S = J = 2) found in [12], and recently also in [13], from the Ysystem/TBA equations (starting from the weak coupling region and interpolating numerically\nto strong coupling).\nThe J 2 term in (1.2) has a simple classical origin.6 Consider, e.g., a \"short\" string with some\ncharge N (e.g. spin or oscillation number) orbiting also in S 5 . Then for small \u221aN\u03bb we have\n\u221a\n2\n\u03bbN + aN 2 + J 2 + ... (a is a state-dependent constant).\nfor the classical string energy\nE\n=\n2\n0\n\u221a\nAssuming that Q, J \u226a \u03bb we then find the following expansion\nq \u221a\ni\nh\nJ2 \u0011\n1 \u0010\n+ ... .\n(1.3)\nE0 = 2 \u03bbN 1 + \u221a aN +\nN\n4 \u03bb\nFor N = 2 we then get a state on the first excited string level. Switching on non-zero J thus\nshifts the value of b1 coefficient in (1.1) by the J 2 term given in (1.2).\nBelow we shall illustrate and verify this argument on several explicit examples. We shall consider the same solutions as in [1] and generalize them to the case of non-zero orbital momentum\nJ in S 5 . \u221a\nIn particular, we will show that for rigid circular strings switching on a non-zero value\nof J \u226a \u03bb does not alter the value of the 1-loop string correction to b1 found in [1]. The\nresulting states with N = 2 (to be on the first excited string level, cf. (1.3)) and J = 2 will\ntransform in the same representations as the corresponding members of the Konishi multiplet\nand for all of them we will find that b1 = 2, matching the Y-system result of [12].\n\n2\n\nExamples of semiclassical string states dual to\n\u22060 = 6 states in Konishi multiplet\n\nWe shall start with examples of simple circular string solutions which have three non-vanishing\nspins and generalize the 2-spin solutions considered in [1]. For each such solution (with values\n(like the graviton in the superstring spectrum) as a state created by four fermion zero modes. At the same time,\nin our semiclassical description, the S 5 momentum J is captured by the orbital motion of the string's center\nof mass. It is possible, however, to choose a different quantization scheme [10] in which the \"bottom\" of the\nsupergravity multiplet is the E = J = 2 state that carries no fermion zero modes and thus admits a semiclassical\ndescription in terms of a massless particle orbiting a big circle of S 5 . Then excited string states obtained by\nacting with bosonic creation operators on this \"vacuum\" should also have a semiclassical description. The same\nshould hold both for the \"bottom\" of the excited string multiplet as well as for states at higher levels. Indeed,\nby acting with supersymmetry transformations on the lowest state in the multiplet one always obtains at least\none term in which all supersymmetry transformations act on the bosonic oscillators and which thus does not\ncontain fermion zero modes (a similar observation applies to the type IIB superparticle multiplet [11]). For an\neven number of such transformations there will be at least one component which is bosonic (i.e. it does not\ncontain an even number of fermion oscillators) which should thus have a semiclassical counterpart.\n6\nThis term was already mentioned in footnote 34 in [1]. There we considered the example of a short (S, J)\nfolded string [5, 16] but we were wrongly assuming that S = 4 (instead of S = 2) in which case there is no\ncorresponding state in the Konishi multiplet.

Unlike the two previous examples, there exist several states in the Konishi\n2 2\nmultiplet table which transform in this representation (at levels \u22060 = 6 and \u22060 = 4, 8). Since\nin the flat space limit this state happens to combine with the previous two circular string states\ninto a single Lorentz-invariant multiplet, we expect that it corresponds to a level \u22060 = 6 state.\nThe resulting b1 takes again the same value:\nb1 = 2\n2.4\n\n\u00101\n\n2\n\nS+\n\nJ22 \u0011\n=2.\n8S S=1,J2=2\n\n(2.21)\n\nOn the\n\u221a independence of the leading 1-loop correction to string energy on\nJ\u226a \u03bb\n\nOne\ngive a general argument suggesting that if a semiclassical angular momentum J =\n\u221a may \u221a\n\u03bbJ \u226a \u03bb is added to a classical solution carrying other charges (of the same order or\nlarger) in the quantum corrections to the string energy its presence will first show up at order\n2\nJ 2 = (\u221aJ\u03bb)2 . The leading \u221a1\u03bb order (for fixed J) correction is then not affected by J as it\nhappened in the examples discussed above.\n7\n\n\fThe J \u2192 \u2212J symmetry of the string Lagrangian expanded around a solution of the type\ndescribed above implies that it depends on J only through J 2 . This need not, however, immediately apply to quantum corrections to the energy or other charges. For example, for special\nfluctuation modes the corresponding solutions of the characteristic equations may depend, in\nfact, on |J | suggesting that such terms may potentially appear in the 1-loop correction to the\nenergy.\nOne may make an assumption that if J is added to a non-trivial classical solution, then\nobservables should be continuous functions of J , i.e. that the limit J \u2192 0 should give the\nsame answer whether one approaches the J = 0 point from J > 0 or from J < 0.11\nSuppose we consider a string partition function as function of parameters of the classical\nsolution and evaluate the derivative of it with respect to J . Potential terms containing |J |\n|\nwould make this derivative discontinuous at J = 0 as d|J\n= sgn(J ). As discussed in [22],\ndJ\nthe semiclassical parameter J may be given the interpretation of the chemical potential for\nthe angular momentum J. The conformal gauge constraint relates this chemical potential to\nchemical potentials for other charges and for the energy, i.e. \u03ba = \u03ba(J 2 , ...). Then according\nd\u03ba\nd\nln Z = dJ\nhEi \u2212 hJi . Since \u03ba depends on J 2 and hEi and hJi are assumed to\nto [22] dJ\nd\nln Z must also be continuous, in\nbe continuous functions at J = 0, it then follows that dJ\nparticular, ln Z cannot contain terms proportional to |J |. Higher odd powers of |J | are not\n|J|k\nforbidden by this argument, but they would not contribute at leading \u221a1\u03bb order (|J |k = (\u221a\n).\n\u03bb)k\n\nThe assumption of continuity of observables as J \u2192 0 is potentially subtle, and it is possible\nthat the limit J \u2192 0 may or may not be analytic, depending on a solution in question. Since,\nhowever, J is turned on in the presence of other classical charges, one may expect this nonanalyticity to be weaker than, e.g., in the example discussed in Appendix A in [1]. There\nwe found different results when taking J \u2192 0 before or after doing summation over infinite\nnumber of quantum modes. Unlike the setup discussed here, in that case the classical solution\nwas becoming trivial in the limit J \u2192 0.\n\n3\n\nExamples of semiclassical string states dual to\n\u22060 = 4 states in Konishi multiplet\n\nSimilar observations regarding the generalization to nonvanishing orbital momentum J in S 5\ngo through in the case of more complicated folded spinning string solutions.\n3.1\n\nFolded string with spin S and orbital momentum J\n\nLet us start with the case of folded spinning string with J = 0.

A natural guess could be that they are small pulsating strings\nin AdS3 or R \u00d7S 2 [28, 15]. However, the corresponding 1-loop coefficient a01 contains again ln 2\nterms [15]. By analogy with the folded string case one \u221a\nmay conjecture that first adding a nonzero orbital momentum J and then expanding in J \u226a \u03bb will make\u221aa01 rational. For example,\nfor a \u221a\nstring pulsating in AdS5 with the oscillation number N \u226a \u03bb and orbital momentum\nJ \u226a \u03bb in S 5 one finds as in [15] and above (cf.

A candidate\ndual state in the Konishi multiplet is [0, 2, 0](0,0) at level \u22060 = 4. To reproduce the same\n(0)\nuniversal value b1 = 2 as above we would then need a01 = \u2212 43 (instead of a01 = 52 \u2212 4 ln 2 found\nin [15] by starting directly with the solution having J = 0).\nThe value of the string center-of-mass orbital S 5 momentum J does not influence the value\nof the string excitation level which is determined by spins and oscillation numbers related to\nextended nature of the string (cf. (1.3)). The states with N = 2 in (1.3) but J > 2 will still be\non the first excited level. In general, they will not belong to the Konishi multiplet but rather\nto its Kaluza-Klein descendants (see [8]).\nA non-vanishing value of the orbital angular momentum J is crucial for relating some of the\nclassical solutions we discussed to members of the Konishi multiplet. For example, for J = 0,\nthe circular string solution with one spin in AdS5 and one in S 5 discussed in section 2.3 should\nhave S = 1 = J1 (to represent a state on the first excited string level). It should also correspond\nto a gauge-theory operator in the sl(2) sector, but the minimal R-charge in the sl(2) sector is\nJ1 = 2, so such S = 1 = J1 state should be excluded.\nSolutions with vanishing orbital angular momentum J have a natural place on higher string\nlevels, with level determined by values of the AdS5 and S 5 spins. Choosing the spins so that the\nsolutions correspond to the second excited string level (N = 4 in (1.3))\nfind from the eqs.\n\u221a we \u221a\n(2.5), (2.12), (2.20) the following values of b1 in the analog of (1.1) (E = 2N 4 \u03bb+b0 + \u221a4b1\u03bb +. . .):\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nb1 (J1 = J2 = 2) = 2; b1 (S1 = S2 = 2)\n=\n3\n2;\nb\n(S\n=\nJ\n=\n2)\n=\n2\n2. From the \u221a\neqs. (3.3),\n1\n1\n\u221a\n\u221a\n5\n3\n15\n(3.8), (3.11) we get:\nb1 (S = 4) = 2 2; b1 (J = 4) = 2 2; b1 (S = J1 = 2) = 2 2. These\ndifferent values of the coefficient b1 for states on the same string level are not in contradiction\nwith supersymmetry. Indeed, the corresponding level in the flat space string spectrum contains\n81 physical long multiplets, each of them generating a KK tower in AdS\n\u00d7 S 5 [8]. While\n\u221a 5\u221a\n4\nthe leading order terms in the energy of all such states are equal to 2 2 \u03bb, the order \u221a41\u03bb\ncorrections can be different.\nFinally, it goes without saying that the construction of a systematic quantization of AdS5 \u00d7S 5\nsuperstring in the perturbative large tension expansion remains an important open problem.\nSome related recent work this direction appeared in [29, 30]. The consistent results found in\nthe semiclassical approach should provide an important guidance.\n15\nThe Konishi multiplet also contains a state in the representation [0, 0, 0](2,2), which has S = 4. It should\ncorrespond to a string state on the first excited level with 2 units of spin carried by the two string oscillators\nand the other two units of spin carried by the graviton vacuum state.\n\n11\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nWe thank M.

Gromov for informing us about a forthcoming paper [26] in which\neq.(3.4) is derived analytically and the conclusion that the semiclassical approach applied to\nthe case of the folded spinning string with S = J = 2 leads to the same value b1 = 2 as in\n[12] is reached independently. We also thank B. Vallilo for sending us a draft of [31] which also\nclaims, using a different method, that b1 = 2 for a different state (with zero S 5 momentum) on\nthe first excited string level.\n\nAppendix: 1-loop correction to energy of 3-spin solution of sec. 2.1\nHere we present some details of the calculation of the 1-loop correction to the energy of the\n3-spin solution [6, 20] in the small-string regime discussed in section 2.1. In this case J1 =\nJ2 = J \u2032 \u226a 1. The equations of motion and the conformal gauge constraints may be easily\nsolved and the resulting expansions in small J for fixed J \u2032 are\nh\ni\nJ\nJ\u2032\n3J \u2032 (1 + 2J \u2032 ) 4\n2\n6\n1\n\u2212\nJ\n+\nJ\n+\nO(J\n)\n,\n1 \u2212 2J \u2032\n(1 \u2212 2J \u2032 )3\n4(1 \u2212 2J \u2032 )6\ni\n\u221a h\n(12J \u20322 \u2212 4J \u2032 + 1)J 4\nJ2\n6\n\u2032\n\u2212\n+\nO(J\n)\n,\nE0 = \u03ba = 2 J 1 +\n8(1 \u2212 2J \u2032 )J \u2032\n128(1 \u2212 2J \u2032 )4 J \u20322\n\n\u03bd =\n\n(A.1)\n(A.2)\n\nleading to the expansion of the classical energy in (2.4).16\nThe 1-loop calculation may proceed either by evaluating the frequencies of the physical\n1 P+\u221e\nFn\nfluctuations around the solution and constructing E1 = 2\u03ba\nn=\u2212\u221e (\u2212) \u03c9n , or by directly\nevaluating the determinant of the quadratic fluctuation operator. We will use the fluctuation\nfrequencies found in [20] and expand them in small J . Then E1 has the following expansion\nE1 =\n\ni\nX\n1h\n1 +\u221e\nf0 (J \u2032 ) + f1 (J \u2032 )J + f2 (J \u2032 )J 2 + O(J 3 ) .\n(\u2212)Fn \u03c9n =\n2\u03ba n=\u2212\u221e\n\u03ba\n\n(A.3)\n\nThe analyticity properties of the functions fi (J \u2032 ) determine the order in the \u221a1\u03bb expansion (for\nfixed J, J \u2032 ) to which they contribute.\nIn general, these functions appear to be analytic, or at\n\u221a\n\u2032\nmost have simple poles in \u221a J . In particular, the third term, proportional to J 2 , is of too\nhigh an order in the large \u03bb expansion to be relevant for the leading \u221a1\u03bb correction that we\nare concerned with here. The argument outlined in section 2.4 suggests that f1 (J \u2032 ) = 0. We\nwill see that this is indeed the case.\n16\n\nLet us mention that starting with\n\nand J \u2032 (e.g. one finds terms like\n\n\u221a1\n( \u03bb)2\n\norder, the energy depends not just on\n\nJ2\n4\u03bb ).\n\n12\n\nJ2\nJ\u2032 ,\n\nbut independently on J\n\n\f\u221a\nAs found in [20], apart from two massless modes and four bosonic modes with \u03c9n = n2 + \u03ba2\nthe characteristic\u221afrequencies are the roots of the \"bosonic\" and \"fermionic\" polynomials (\u03a9 \u2261\n\u03c9 2 and q \u2261 2J \u2032 / 1 + \u03bd 2 )\n\u0010\n\nB8 (\u03a9) = \u03a94 + \u03a93 \u22128 \u2212 4n2 + 20q \u2212 8\u03ba2\n\n\u0011\n\n+\u03a92 (16 + 8n2 + 6n4 \u2212 80q \u2212 36n2 q + 96q 2 + 32\u03ba2 + 16n2 \u03ba2 \u2212 80q\u03ba2 + 16\u03ba4 )\n+\u03a9(\u221232n2 + 8n4 \u2212 4n6 + 96n2 q + 12n4 q \u2212 96n2 q 2 \u2212 32n2 \u03ba2 \u2212 8n4 \u03ba2 + 48n2 q\u03ba2 )\n+16n4 \u2212 8n6 + n8 \u2212 16n4 q + 4n6 q ,\nF8 (\u03a9) = 2\u03a94 + \u03a93 (\u22128 \u2212 12\u03ba2 \u2212 8n2 + 20q)\n+\u03a92 (12 + 28\u03ba2 + 18\u03ba4 + 8n2 + 28\u03ba2 n2 + 12n4 \u2212 52q \u2212 64\u03ba2 q \u2212 36n2 q + 59q 2 )\n+\u03a9(\u22128 \u2212 20\u03ba2 \u2212 20\u03ba4 \u2212 8\u03ba6 + 8n2 + 8n2 \u03ba2 \u2212 20\u03ba4 n2 + 8n4 \u2212 20\u03ba2 n4\n\u2212 8n6 + 44q + 80\u03ba2 q + 44\u03ba4 q \u2212 24n2 q + 32\u03ba2 n2 q + 12n4 q \u2212 78q 2\n\u2212 79\u03ba2 q 2 + 2n2 q 2 + 45q 3 )\n+2 + 4\u03ba2 + 2\u03ba4 \u2212 8n2 \u2212 4\u03ba2 n2 \u2212 4\u03ba4 n2 + 12n4 \u2212 4\u03ba2 n4 + 2\u03ba4 n4\n\u22128n6 + 4\u03ba2 n6 + 2n8 \u2212 12q \u2212 16\u03ba2 q \u2212 4\u03ba4 q + 28qn2 + 16\u03ba2 n2 q\n+4\u03ba4 n2 q \u2212 20n4 q + 4n6 q + 27q 2 + 21\u03ba2 q 2 + 2\u03ba4 q 2 \u2212 30n2 q 2\n\u221211\u03ba2 n2 q 2 + 11n4 q 2 \u2212 27q 3 \u2212 9\u03ba2 q 3 + 9n2 q 3 + 81\nq4 .\n(A.4)\n8\n\nA closed-form expression for the characteristic frequencies does not seem to exist but one may\nreadily find their expansion in small J .
