The splitting is a peculiarity of charged fermions and is linear in the field to leading order\nin q bearing resemblance to the Zeeman effect in this limit, and providing a clear signature for the\nexperimental observation of this mode.\nPACS numbers: 75.10.Lp,75.30.Ds,71.10.Ay\n\nMagnetism in solids has been one of the most studied\nsubjects in physics for the past decades. In particular the\nbehavior of propagating spin waves in metallic materials\nhas now a long list of contributions in the literature. Spin\nwaves in ferromagnetic materials were first predicted by\nBloch [1] and Slater [2] and later observed in iron by\nLowde. [3] These first theories were constructed based\non lattice models of local moments. Predictions for spin\nwaves using Fermi liquid theory [4] were first made by\nSilin for paramagnetic systems. [5] Paramagnetic spinwaves were found to propagate only under an applied\nmagnetic field. Abrikosov and Dzyaloshinskii [6] were\nthe first to develop a theory of itinerant ferromagnetism\nbased on Landau's theory of Fermi liquids. Although\ncorrect at the phenomenological level, the microscopic\nfoundations for this theory were estabilished only much\nlater by Dzyaloshinskii and Kondratenko. [7]\nIn this paper we derive the hydrodynamic equations of\nthe ferromagnetic Fermi liquid theory (FFLT) for a finite\nmagnetic field and show that an intrisic degeneracy of a\nrecently predicted massive mode [8] exists and is lifted\nunder the external field, similarly to the Zeeman splitting of a single spin in a magnetic field. Underneath this\neffect we identify the breaking of chiral symmetry by the\nexternal magnetic field in the case of charged fermions,\nwhich relates to the orbital motion developed under the\nLorentz force. Besides being a clear signature of the massive mode, it is suggested that quantization of this mode\nwill lead to a system of massive magnons with \"up\" and\n\"down\" states that split under an external field. We estimate the values for the fields where the effect will be\nobserved in typical weak ferromagnets.\nFor isotropic metals, the equations describing dynamics of paramagnetic spin waves are similar to the ones\nthat result from FFLT in the small moments limit. This\nis expected since in this limit quasi-particles can be defined and one recovers the kinetic behavior of ordinary\nFermi liquid theory. However, FFLT rests on the assumption of a quite different, symmetry-broken, ground state\nand the resulting spin waves propagate with no external\n\nmagnetic field present. The Goldstone mode associated\nwith spontaneously broken spin rotation invariance has\nbeen the paradigm of spin-waves in an isotropic single\nband ferromagnet and can be derived from FFLT (as\nwell as from lattice models). However, FFLT contains\nspin-wave modes that have not yet been observed, as\npointed out in Ref. [8], where the proper hydrodynamics\nand parameters for the propagation of the lowest in energy of these modes have been studied. Such mode is not\na Goldstone mode, hence its dispersion may in principle\nbe gapped for q = 0. Indeed, for low q and zero external\nmagnetic field, its dispersion has been shown to be of the\nform \u03c9 = \u03c91+ \u2212 \u03b1q 2 , [9] and propagation is possible only\nin the quantum hydrodynamic regime (at temperatures\nfor which collisions are almost absent). This is in contrast to the Goldstone mode which is purelly quadratic\nand also propagates at collision dominated temperatures.\n[10] Propagation of the massive mode also requires that\nthe interactions have some finite amplitude with p-wave\nsymmetry. Lack of observation of such a mode in neutron\nscattering experiments can be attributed to the low spectral weight the mode carries at small q (\u223c q 2 when rated\nagainst the Goldstone mode), however indirect signs of\nits existence have already been observed. [8]\nWe begin our derivation by writing the equal\ntime propagator for a system of interacting fermions,\nG\u03c31 \u03c32 (r1 r2 ) \u2261 ha\u2020\u03c31 (r1 )a\u03c32 (r2 )i, where a is the usual\nfermion anihilation Heisenberg operator and the average is taken with a ferromagnetic ground state. The\nequation\nR of motion for G is, in spin space, \u2202t G(r1 r2 ) +\n(i/h\u0304) dr\u2032 [H(r1 r\u2032 )G(r\u2032 r2 ) \u2212 G(r1 r\u2032 )H(r\u2032 r2 )] = g[G],\nwhere H is the interaction Hamiltonian and the functional g[G] is the full time-derivative of G. Following an\nusual script, one turns\nto a mixed r - p representation by\nR\n\u2032\ndefining Hp (r) = dr\u2032 e\u2212ip*r /h\u0304 H(r + r\u2032 /2, r \u2212 r\u2032 /2), and\nlikewise for Np (r), which brings the equation of motion\nto the form\nZ\n\u0002\n\u2202t Np (r) + D\u03c4 Hp\u2032 +h\u0304k/2 (r\u2032 + h\u0304s/2)Np\u2032 (r\u2032 )\n\u0003\n\u2212 Np\u2032 (r\u2032 )Hp\u2032 \u2212h\u0304k/2 (r\u2032 \u2212 h\u0304s/2) = J[Np ], (1)\n1\n\n\f\u2032\n\n(a)s\n\n\u2032\n\nwhere D\u03c4 \u2261 idr\u2032 dsdp\u2032 dkei[(p \u2212p)*s+(r\u2212r )*k] /(2\u03c0)6 h\u0304. Expanding Eq.(1) in s and k yields a formal series in h\u0304,\n\n2|m0 |(F1a /3 \u2212 F0a )/h\u0304N (0) is the gap, Fl\nare the usual\ndimensionless spin (anti) symmetric interaction parameters, and N (0) is the density of states at the Fermi surface.\nThe preceding discussion is general and establishes\nthe origin of the massive mode. We now turn to the\nsmall moments limit, where kinetic equations can be\namenably derived. In this limit, we write the effective quasiparticle Hamiltonian and density matrix respectively as Hp\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 (r) = \u01ebp (r)\u03b4\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 + hp (r) * \u03c4\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 , and\nNp\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 (r) = np (r)\u03b4\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 + \u03c3p (r) * \u03c4\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 . These forms for the\nHamiltonian and density immediately give\n\n\u0012 \u0013n+m\u22121\n\u221e\nX\n(\u22121)n ih\u0304\n2\n2\nn,m=0\n\u0014 2\n\u0015\nn Y\nm\nY\n\u2202 Hp (r)\n\u22022\n, Np (r) , (2)\n\u00d7\n\u2202r\u03b1j \u2202p\u03b2l \u2202r\u03b2l \u2202p\u03b1j\n\u00b1\nj=1\n\n\u2202t Np (r) \u2212 J[Np ] =\n\nl=1\n\nwhere we have (anti) commutation if m + n is (odd) even\nand sumation over repeated Greek indices.\nIt is clear from this expression that the repeated action of the derivatives on the fluctuating fields generate\ncoefficients that are higher order in q for higher powers\nof h\u0304. If we keep terms up to first order in q,\ni\n1\n\u2202t Np (r) + [Hp (r) , Np (r)] \u2212 {Hp (r), Np (r)}\nh\u0304\n2\n1\n+ {Np (r), Hp (r)} = J[Np ],\n2\n\n2\ni\n[Hp (r), Np (r)] = (\u03c3p (r) \u00d7 hp (r)) * \u03c4 .\nh\u0304\nh\u0304\nHere the internal field is given by\nhp (r) = \u2212\n\n(3)\n\n\u03b3h\u0304\n2\u03c0 2 h\u03042 X a\nF Pl (p\u0302 * p\u0302\u2032 )\u03c3p\u2032 (r),\nH+ \u2217\n2\nm kF \u2032 l\n\n(6)\n\npl\n\nwhere Pl are Legendre polynomials, H is an external\nmagnetic field, and all coupling constants are h\u0304 independent. We see then from Eqs.(5) and (6) that the\ncommutator of Eq.(3) gives two contributions: a zero-th\norder term in h\u0304 which is just the (Larmor) precession\nof the internal magnetization and a first order term in\nh\u0304 that is the precession about the field generated internally. Carefull examination of Eq.(2) shows that this\nterm is the only first order term in h\u0304 of the series. That\nis, provided that the effective Hamiltonian is of the Fermi\nliquid type, the long wavelength limit is equivalent to a\nWentzel-Kramers-Brillouin or (eikonal) semi-classical approximation.\nWe want now to have the Lorentz-force operator explicitly factorized. This is achieved by rewriting Eq.(3)\nin a gauge transformed \"frame\" for which A = 0. Also,\nto leading order in the fluctuations, the non-commuting\nparts of the Poisson brackets can be dropped, giving\n\nwhere square braces indicate the usual commutator while\ncurly braces are Poisson brackets. Therefore, keeping\nfirst order in q leads to the same result obtained by dropping terms in the series that are explicitly O(h\u03042 ). However, Hp (r) is itself a function of h\u0304, which disables, at\nthis point, comparison with a semi-classical approach.\nFor the ferromagnetic Fermi liquid there are two distinct underlying scenarios that we call (following Ref. [8])\nclassical and quantum spin hydrodynamics. We want\nhere to discuss in a general way the origin of these two\nregimes. For this purpose, it should be recalled that the\nequilibrium density matrix for a ferromagnetic state is\nwritten in the quite general form, [6]\n0\n0\nNp\u03c3\u03c3\n\u2032 = np \u03b4\u03c3\u03c3 \u2032 + \u03b7(p)m0 * \u03c4\u03c3\u03c3 \u2032 ,\n\n(5)\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c4 are Pauli matrices and m0 is the equilibrium\nmagnetization density, which is a conserved quantity of\nthe ferromagnetic Hamiltonian. From this it is clear that\nthe commutator in (3) is zero unless there are fluctuations\nabout equilibrium.\nAt high temperatures, thermal fluctuations dominate\nand this commutator remains irrelevant. The remaining\n\"classical\" terms lead to the known Bloch-like hydrodynamics for the Goldstone mode. This regime is refered\nto as \"classical spin hydrodynamics.\"\nAt low temperatures quantum fluctuations dominate,\nand the commutator in (3) becomes important. It remains finite as long as the fluctuations contain, besides\nthe usual Goldstone-mode, contributions from non conserved quantities as it is the case of spin-current, whose\noscillations give rise to the gapped mode studied in Ref.\n[8], where this regime has been called \"quantum spin hydrodynamics.\"\nThe crossover temperature for these two regimes\nhas been found to scale with (\u03c91+ )1/2 , where \u03c91+ \u2261\n\n\u2202t Np (r) +\n\ni\n[Hp (r), Np (r)] + {Np (r), Hp (r)}\nh\u0304 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202Np (r) \u2202Hp (r)\n+e\n\u00d7\n* H = J[Np ].\n\u2202p\n\u2202p\n\n(7)\n\nWe see that the gauge boost factorizes a non-chiral term\nwhose amplitude is proportional to e|H|. This is the contribution from the orbital motion of charged quasiparticles, a result similar to the one found in the theory of\nnormal metals, [11] where it is known simply to shift the\nparamagnetic resonances. In the isotropic ferromagnetic\ncase we are studying here this term plays a more essential role. Equation (7) is formally identical to the one\nobtained in a normal metal. The difference rests on the\nbroken symmetry ground state, whose density is given by\nEq.(4).\nLet R+(\u2212) be a simultaneous proper (improper) rotation of real and momentum axes and likewise SU +(\u2212) for\n2\n\n\fthe spin axes. Examination of Eq.(7) reveals that in the\nabsence of a magnetic field, R\u00b1 are symmetry operations\nboth in the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic cases, SU \u2212\nis not a symmetry in either case, and SU + distinguishes\nthe two cases, being a broken symmetry in the ferromagnetic case. The presence of H adds two terms to the\nequation, one that couples to spin through hp and the\norbital one discussed above which couples to charge. In a\ncharged paramagnet, the former will break SU + symmetry yielding propagating paramagnons as a consequence,\nwhile the latter will break R\u2212 (chiral) symmetry. However, since the spin modes are sustained by a finite H,\n[5] the degeneracies associated with chiral symmetry are\nlifted with H, before spin waves can propagate.\nIn the isotropic ferromagnet, spin waves can propagate in the absence of H, for the SU + is a spontaneously\nbroken symmetry and the internal \"sustaining\" field is\nprovided by m0 . Hence propagating modes exist before\nthe formation of orbits with the breaking of R\u2212 by a\nfinite H, and some of these modes may be degenerate.\nBreaking chiral symmetry should then lift such degeneracies. Note that the Goldstone mode should not be\naffected by H (apart, of course, from shifting) for the\nterm breaking chiral symmetry only couples to charge.\nHowever, the gapped spin-wave mode splits as it is seen\nin the dispersion relations of Fig.(1).\nIn order to see how this happens, we finish linearizing\nEq.(7), and then solve it in the hydrodynamic limit. [9]\nIn particular, since we are seekingP\nequations on the total\nmagnetization density m\n\u2261\ntr[\u03c4\np Np ], and spin curP\nrent tensor j\u03c3 i \u2261 tr[\u03c4 p (\u2202Hp /\u2202pi )Np ], we trace the\nproduct of \u03c4 with Eq.(7) and keep only terms that are\nlinear in the fluctuations.

For\nsimplicity we specialize to the case H0 \u22a5 q (indicated\nby \u03b8 = 90o in the figures). This condition is obtained in\npractice by sheding neutrons or photons adequately on\na finite sample's surface, and is the condition that maximizes the non-chiral orbital contribution in Eq.(10); in\nthe infinite system, we can think of transverse magnons\nif we wish to quantize the hydrodynamics. Longitudinal\nmagnons will be treated elsewhere. [12] In Fig.(1) we see\nthe dispersion relations for different values of the external\nfield. These are obtained by looking into the free modes\n(\u03b4H = 0). It is clear that the degeneracy is only exact\nat q = 0. We see also that it constitutes a three-fold\ndegeneracy, however, the two constant branches shown\n(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9L \u2261 \u2206\u03c9 = \u03c91+ ) are spurious when H0 = 0 in\nthe sense that there is no spectral weight associated with\nthem, as seen in Fig.(2) where S(q, \u03c9) \u221d Im[\u03b4m+ /\u03b4H + ]\n(which is the important quantity in experiments) is plotted as a function of \u03c9 and H\u2217 .

The\npossible existence of (low temperature) magnons with\nmass and a Zeeman-like degeneracy makes room for new\nquestions realated, e.g., to the collective behavior of a\nhandful of these excitations. Before these questions are\nput forward it is, however, prudent to focus on the issue\nof whether these results can be observed by traditional\nexperiments. The spectral weight of this mode, of order of 10\u22122 the usual spin waves (see Fig.(2)) stands as\nan obstacle. Our main emphasis here is whence on the\nadditional criterium such a degeneracy provides to track\ndown the massive mode. In a companion longer article\nwe also discuss how these results are expected to show in\na conduction ressonance experiment. [12]\nThe authors aknowledge fruitful discussions with K.\nBlagoev.

These amplitudes are of order of 10\u22122 the (not\nshown) Goldstone mode amplitudes which do not split under\nthe external field. The curves are translated vertically to facilitate analysis.

This can be seen in\nFig.(3) where the behavior of these dispersions with the\nexternal field is shown (including the Goldstone mode).\nIt is then clear that the splitting of the gapped mode\nshould be considered as a distinctive feature in experiments searching for a direct observation of it. It should\nbe helpful to make a statement about the quantities involved for some traditional materials: From data found\nin the literature we estimate the fields shown to be in the\nrange of hundreds of Gauss for typical weak ferromagnets\nlike MnSi, ZrZn2 , and Ni3 Al. This corresponds to a gap\nof tenths of meV in these materials.
