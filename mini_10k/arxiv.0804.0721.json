In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and\nRosen (EPR)[1] argued that correlations between entangled particles imply the necessity of such hidden variables. In 1964, John S. Bell then described a modified\nEPR setup which would make it possible to experimentally determine whether or not hidden variables could\nreproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics[2]. A\nlarge number of experiments has since been carried out\nand all these experiments confirm the quantum mechanical predictions to a very high degree thus apparently ruling out hidden variable theories[3]. Although loopholes\ncannot entirely be discounted, considering the variety of\nthe experiments, it seems extremely unlikely that experimental flaws can account for the results obtained. The\nBell theorem stating that \"no physical theory of local hidden variables can ever reproduce all of the predictions of\nquantum mechanics\" therefore appears to stand on firm\nground and a realistic theory impossible.\nIn this paper, the following question is addressed: Is\nit possible to reproduce Bell correlations from a locally\nrealistic perfectly efficient classical apparatus if the correlations are calculated in the same fashion as in the experiments that violate the Bell inequalities? That is to\nsay when coincidence monitors are used or equal time\nmeasurements taken.\nIn the literature, Bell inequality generally stands for a\nvariety of inequalities that can be used to discriminate\nbetween the predictions of quantum physics and possible realistic models. A violation of a Bell inequality is\nthought to only be possible in a quantum mechanical description. Closely related to the Bell inequalities are the\n\n\u2217 URL:\nhttp://chaos.nus.edu.sg/ ;\nElectronic\nphyfhw@nus.edu.sg, willeboordse@yahoo.com\n\naddress:\n\nBell correlations which are such that they violate the Bell\ninequalities and hence are a tell-tale sign of a non-realistic\nsystem. Lastly, Bell experiments are experiments that\ntest the Bell inequalities.\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL SETUP\n\nLet us consider the Bell inequalities due to Clauser,\nHorne, Shimony and Holt (CHSH)[4]. A typical experimental setup is depicted in Figure 1. In this setup, a\nsource creates an entangled pair of particles (usually photons) that interact with a detector that can be in one of\ntwo possible settings (e.g. the direction with respect to\nwhich polarization is measured). The detector setting\nmust be completely random, unknown to the source at\nthe time a pair of particles is created, and independent\nof the other detector's setting. Consequently, communication between the detectors, the source and the detectors etc. is not allowed thus ensuring that the physical\nprocesses occurring when a particle hits a detector are\nlocal. When a particle interacts with a detector, a binary outcome is generated which together with the detector setting is either forwarded to a coincidence monitor\nor recorded with an accurate clock for later comparison\n(the latter is conceptually equivalent and not further discussed here).\nOne can then determine the various (anti-)correlations\nbetween the right and left hand detector settings and\ncompare the experimental outcomes with quantum mechanical and classical calculations. Denoting the expectation values for the (anti-)correlations as E\u03c6 (Ai , Bj )\nwhere \u03c6 is the angle between the detectors A and B that\nhave settings i, j = 1, 2 respectively, CHSH consider the\nfollowing sum of (anti-)correlations [4]\nS\u03c6 = E\u03c6 (A1 , B1 )+E\u03c6 (A1 , B2 )+E\u03c6 (A2 , B1 )\u2212E\u03c6 (A2 , B2 ).\n(1)\n\u221a\nQuantum mechanically, the maximum is S\u03c6 = 2 2 while\nin a realistic model, the maximum is S\u03c6 = 2 [3]. The realistic result is easily illustrated: assume that the photon\ncarries the binary information for each possible detector setting. For example, if we take A1 = 1, A2 = 0,\n\n\f2\nB1 = 0 and B1 = 0 (in total there are 16 possibilities),\nthen S = 2; changing a 0 to a 1 may at best improve\nthe anti-correlation with one detector but this will be at\nthe expense of the anti-correlation with another detector. Therefore, if an experiment produces an S\u03c6 clearly\nlarger than 2, a realistic explanation appears impossible.\nAnd this is exactly what was demonstrated in sophisticated experiments by e.g. Aspect[5], Freedman[6] and\nmany others where Max(S\u03c6 ) > 2 was found.\nrandom\nrandom\n\nA1\n\n1\n\nA2\n\n\u2022 If the right detector is in position B1 , it outputs\nthe bit carried by the bullet immediately when the\nbullet arrives.\n\u2022 If the right detector is in position B2 , it outputs\nthe NOT of the bit with a given delay \u2206t after the\nbullet arrives.\n\n1\n\n1\n0\n\n\u2022 If the left detector is in position A2 , randomly, it\neither outputs the bit carried by the bullet immediately when the bullet arrives, or with a given delay\n\u2206t after the bullet arrives.\n\nS\n\nB1\n\n0\n\nB2\n\n1\n0\n\n\u2022 All actions are local. There is no communication\nbetween the detectors.\nThese instructions are summarized in Figure 2.\n\n0\nrandom\n\nCoincidence\nMonitor\n\nAlthough it seems that conceptually, the existence of\na coincidence monitor does not change the logic of the\nargument, this is only so if from the outset the current\nquantum mechanical interpretation is taken to be correct. But if the the purpose is to verify this interpretation, then it cannot be taken as a matter of course that a\ncoincidence monitor is included in the setup or that equal\ntime measurements are carried out. It is therefore investigated here what the possible impact of a coincidence\nmonitor is by considering two classical apparatuses that\ninclude this experimental component.\n\nIII.\n\nAPPARATUS 1\n\nHere, instead of viewing it as an experimental setup\nwith photons, we take Figure 1 to depict a classical apparatus that functions as follows:\n\u2022 The source sends out two bullets in opposite directions. Randomly, one of the bullets carries a 1 and\nthe other a 0.\n\u2022 During the flight, randomly and independently\nfrom each other, the detectors are set into position\n1 or 2.\n\u2022 If the left detector is in position A1 , randomly, it\neither outputs the bit carried by the bullet immediately when the bullet arrives, or a NOT of the bit\nwith a given delay \u2206t after the bullet arrives.\n\nt2\n\nrandom\n\nx\n\nx\n\nt1 \u2206t\n\nt2\n\nA1\nx\n\nS\n\nx\n\nA2\n\nB1 xt\nrandom\n\nFIG. 1: Typical setup in a CHSH style Bell correlation experiment.

The binary variable x randomly takes on the value 0 or 1.\n\nWhen calculating the correlations on an event basis,\nas expected, this apparatus will not give Bell correlations. However, if the correlations are calculated, just\nlike in actual experiments, with the help of coincidence\nmonitoring, Bell correlations are obtained. Indeed, the\napparatus will yield the maximum possible S = 3.\nFigure 3 shows some possible data of a simulation as\nthey arrive at the coincidence monitor. There is a 50%\nchance that an output of one detector is at a different\ntime of the other detector, giving single counts 66% of\nthe time that are ignored by the coincidence monitor.\nExperimentally, such single counts would be very hard\nto distinguish from dark counts but if the Bell theorem\nholds, all outputs should be coincidence counts. Hence\nin principle, an apparatus like this can be excluded with\na perfect experimental setup having extremely high efficency and, in the case of photon experiments, very few\ndark counts (this seems to exclude all photon experiments\nto date). While the efficency in an ion experiment such\nthat by Rowe [7] is extremely high, measurement is carried out by synchronized detection lasers hence builiding\nin coincidence at even earlier stage. Such experiments\nare therefore not suitable to exclude a mechanism as in\nthe described apparatus.\nStatistically, the apparatus reproduces experimental\noutcomes well. The probability of obtaining a 1 or 0\nfrom all detector settings is 50%, and the probabilities of\neach of the detector combinations is 25%.\n\n\f3\n\nA1 A2 B1 B2\n1\n\nA2 B1\n\n1\n\n1'\n\n0\n\nA2 B2\n\n2\n2'\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n4\n\n1\n\n0\n\nA1 B2\n\n0\n\nA1 B1\n\n4'\n5\n\nS\u03c6 = 2 cos(2\u03c6) + 2 sin(2\u03c6).\n\nA1 B2\n\n3\n3'\n\nS. If we take the detectors to be polarizers that can be\nrotated with respect to each other and for simplicity fix\nthe angles between A1 and A2 , and B1 and B2 respectively to 90 degrees, then the quantum mechanical S is\ngiven by [3]:\n\n1\n\nFigure 4 shows a comparison between the dependence\non \u03c6 in Eq. 2 and the apparatus where the choice of\nwhether or not to apply a time delay to the output of B2\nwas subjected to the following \u03c6-dependent probability\n\u221a\n\u03c0\np\u03c6 = 2 2 sin(2\u03c6 + ) \u2212 2.\n4\n\nFIG. 3: Possible output of apparatus 1. The numbers on\nthe left indicate which bullet the output stems from, and the\nprime indicates an output that occurs after a delay of \u2206t.\n\n\u2022 Detection loophole. All events are recorded and\nnothing is dropped at the detection stage. For every bullet there is an output at each side. There\nis therefore no detection loophole in the apparatus\ndescribed.\n\u2022 Fair sampling loophole This loophole seems to\nhave slightly differing definitions in the literature.\nHere the position is taken that fair sampling means\nthat the experimental data are a fair reflection of\nwhat would be obtained if all the experiments components were perfect. Therefore, given that the coincidence monitor is part of the experiment, the experimentally obtained data appear to be fair samples. By the same token, however, the apparatus\ndelivers fair data as well.\nNow one could argue that if the experimental setup\nwas perfect then there would not be any single\ncounts. However, this is something inferred from\nquantum mechanics, and thus an assumption to be\ndetermined experimentally, and not something that\ncan serve an input to fair sampling. Consequently,\nin my view, the apparatus does not violate the fair\nsampling assumption.\nIn other words, whether or not to include a coincidence monitor or to carry out equal time measurements is an experimental choice. Given the choice,\nthe data are fair but whether the choice is fair needs\nto be justifiable without resorting to the outcome\nexpected from quantum mechanics.\nAlthough the above shows that the Bell inequalities\ncan easily be violated with the help of a coincidence monitor, it is nevertheless illustrative to show that the apparatus can mimic the quantum mechanical prediction for\n\n(3)\n\n3.0\nCorrelation S\u03c6\n\nIt may seem that what is exploited here is either the\ndetection or the fair sampling loophole. While one can\nof course take that viewpoint, I would argue that this is\nnot the case.\n\n(2)\n\n2.8\n2.6\n2.4\n2.2\n2.0\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n0.3\nDetector angle \u03c6\n\n0.4\n\nFIG. 4: Comparison of the quantum mechanical prediction\n(red solid line) and the output from the apparatuses. The\ndiamonds (green) show the out put from apparatus 1 and are\nbasically right on top of the line. The circles (black) show the\noutput of apparatus 2.\n\nAs can clearly be seen, the data match extremely well.\nIt should be stressed though that it is unlikely that there\nis a fundamental meaning to this. The aim here is to\nsimply show that it can be done and not to develop a\npossibly physically meaningful model.\nNext a second similar apparatus is presented. The\nmain difference being that information from successive\nbullets is temporarily stored in the detectors. This kind\nof procedure reduces the number of single counts. Furthermore, it may make long time delays a bit more palatable. As such, apparatus 2 does not add much but it\ndoes illustrate that all kinds of apparatuses of the kind\ndiscussed can be constructed.\n\nIV.\n\nAPPARATUS 2\n\nThe design of apparatus 2 is as follows:\n\u2022 The source sends out two bullets in opposite directions. The bullets carry with them the outputs for\nthe possible detector settings.\n\u2022 The bullets alternately carry slightly different instructions (instruction sets i and ii).\n\n\f4\n\u2022 During the flight of the bullets, the detectors are\nrandomly and independently set to position 1 or 2.\nThere is no communication between the detectors\nor the detectors and the source at any time.\n\nor ones belonging to different bullets are compared. By\nsubjecting the output of B2 to the ad-hoc \u03c6-dependent\nprobability\n\n\u2022 The detectors obtain the instructions from the bullets and output a 0 or 1\n\n(4)\n\n\u2013 Instruction set i: A1 = 0, A2 = 1, B1 =\n0, B2 = 1. Detector settings A1 and B2 generate the output immediately. Detector settings\nA2 and B1 store the instruction and output it\nthe next time a bullet arrives.\n\u2013 Instruction set ii: A1 = 1, A2 = 0, B1 =\n1, B2 = 0. Detector setting A1 generates the\noutput immediately. Detector settings A2 and\nB2 store the instruction and output it with a\nslight delay. Detector setting B1 stores the instruction and outputs it when the next bullet\narrives.\n\u2022 The output is forwarded to the coincidence meter, or alternatively recorded with an accurate time\nstamp.\nFigure 5 shows the instructions for the four possible\ndetector settings containing all the logically attainable\ncombinations for six consecutive bullets in a), while a\npossible sequence of outcomes as forwarded to the coincidence meter due to the randomly switching detectors\nis shown in b). It should be noted again, that the setup\nexactly conforms to requirements for Bell experiments.\nThere is no communication between the detectors and no\nevents are dropped. Not surprisingly then, instructions i\nand ii do by themselves not violate the Bell inequalities\nand S = 2.\na)\n\nb)\nA1 A2 B1 B2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n1\n\n3\n\n0\n\n4\n\n1\n\n5\n\n0\n\n6\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n3\n\n1\n\n4\n\n1\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n6\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\nA1 A2 B1 B2\n1\n\n1\n1\n0\n\n0\n0\n\nA2 B1\nA1 B1\nA2 B2\nA2 B2\nA1 B1\nA2 B1\nA1 B2\nA2 B1\nA2 B2\n\nFIG. 5: a) Logically attainable instructions for six consecutive bullets. b) A possible set of data as it is received by\nthe coincidence meter.

The numbers on the left in a)\nindicate which bullet arrives at the detector.\n\nIf we now take the data from Figure 5 and carry out\nthe coincidence measurement exactly as it is done in experiments, S = 3 is obtained.

Indeed, by the appropriate\nrandom insertion of further single counts and more often\nhaving the detectors output the 'wrong' bit, it should\nbe possible to create data sets that are practically indistinguishable from actual experimental data sets, given\ncurrent photon detector efficiencies and dark count rates\n(A Turing test for Bell correlation data may be a nice\nidea).\nThe argument presented here is not based on loopholes\nbut a different interpretation of what happens in the experiment. Loopholes are related to possible flaws in the\nexperiments such as communication between the two detectors, low detector efficiency or the mistreatment of\ndata - in other words, loopholes question the validity of\nthe outcomes of experiments. Here, the position is that\nexperiments provide a fair representation of the physical processes and that outcomes of the experiments are\nas such correct - given the experimental design choices.\nNeither is it argued that the quantum mechanical calculations so well matched by the experiments are mistaken\nor wrong. Both experiment and theory are believed to be\ncorrect. It is argued that the outcomes could be the result of the experimental design choice of incorporating a\ncoincidence monitor or taking equal time measurements.\nIt may be nice to briefly digress to some wild speculation. Perhaps much of the discussion around the Bell\ninequalities has indirectly been a comparison between apples and oranges. Is it really so that the standard quantum mechanical calculation provides an event for event\nprobability or could it be so that in essence it is an equal\ntime calculation. If so, then may be there is no discrepancy between what is logically possible in a realistic and\na quantum system. To drive the speculation and your\npatience to its limit, let me end this paragraph by conjecturing the following\nConjecture:\nBell correlations are the result of coincidence measurements.\nBy using the coincidence monitor in the apparatuses,\nthe question arises whether or not the simulations are\n\n\f5\ntruly non-local. Locality has been a key requirement for\nBell experiments and even with a significant amount of\nimagination, it seems far-fetched though perhaps logically not entirely impossible, to drop this constraint.\nIn the sense of how actual experiments are carried out,\nthe apparatuses (in conceptual design identical to that\nof many experiments) are definitively local in the same\nway as the experiments of e.g. Aspect and Zeilinger [5, 8].\nThere is clearly no mechanism for the left and right hand\nsides to communicate and no loopholes are exploited.\nHowever, it may not be entirely unreasonable to consider coincidence monitoring to be a non-local activity.\nAfter all, in coincidence monitoring a clear post-selection\nof data takes place. One could therefore argue that most\nif not all experiments to date are non-local in this sense.\nWhether or not one would take that viewpoint, however,\nin the discussion about whether or not a realistic theory\nis fundamentally possible, the important point is that\n\nexperimental setup and apparatus exactly match as with\nregards to the imposed conditions. Since the apparatus\nis able to generate Bell correlations, it can therefore be\nconcluded that the experiments to date do not substantiate the view that a hidden variable theory is impossible\nas strongly as hitherto believed.\nIndeed, to exclude the kind of apparatuses presented\nhere, in experiments, it may be necessary to calculate the\ncorrelations on an event by event basis and avoid the use\nof coincidence monitors or equal time measurements.\n\n[1] A.
