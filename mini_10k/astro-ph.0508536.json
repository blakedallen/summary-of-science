There are pieces of observational evidence that properties and evolution of the baryonic component are not independent of those of the dark matter, but\nare closely correlated. For instance, early/late type galaxies dominate the bright/faint part of the galaxy luminosity function, which suggests that the star formation his-\n\n\u22c6\n\nBased on data collected at Subaru Telescope, which is operated\nby the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.\nc 2005 RAS\n\ntory and/or morphology are related to the total mass of\nthe system, provided that the luminosity is basically proportional to the total mass. Another example is the morphologydensity relation (Dressler 1980; Postman & Geller 1984),\nwhich may indicate the possible influence of the mass of\nhosting halo on the galaxy formation on group/cluster scale\nas well. It follows from these pieces of evidence that the mass\nof the hosting halo could be one of the most fundamental\nquantities in the galaxy formation. Therefore, in order to\nunderstand the galaxy formation, the evolution of baryonic\nand dark matter should not be treated as independent processes but should be investigated in a unified way.\n\n\f2\n\nT. Hamana et al.\n\nThe baryonic contents (stars and gas) of galaxies have\nbeen well studied by both photometric and spectroscopic observations and have been extensively analyzed with a help\nof well developed theoretical tools such as stellar population synthesis models (e.g., Bruzual & Charlot 2003). On\nthe other hand, the dark matter component of hosting halos\nhas been less studied observationally due to the technical\ndifficulties in probing it since it requires dynamical tracers\nor gravitational lensing. Theoretical models for the evolution of dark matter, however, have been well developed with\nnumerical simulations and analytical models such as PressSchechter prescriptions (Press & Schechter 1974).\nIt has been known that a large-scale clustering amplitude of galaxies provides a unique way of estimating their\nhosting halo mass in a statistical manner. This makes use of\na finding from theoretical studies of dark-matter structure\nformation in the cold dark matter (CDM) model that a clustering amplitude of dark matter haloes depends monotonically and strongly on the halo mass (Mo & White 1996). By\nmeasuring the clustering amplitude of galaxy populations\nselected from a wide-field survey, we can relate properties of\nthe populations such as stellar mass and/or star formation\nrate with the mass of their hosting halo (e.g., Giavalisco &\nDickinson 2001; Adelberger et al. 2005). It, in turn, enables\nus to explore an ancestor\u2013descendant connection of different\ngalaxy populations at various redshifts from the viewpoints\nof both the star formation and the dark matter assembly\n(Moustakas & Somerville 2002; Hamana et al. 2004; Ouchi\net al 2004b).\nThis approach is exactly the one we take, in what follows, to explore the evolution of the old passively-evolving\ngalaxies (OPEGs) at z \u223c 1 and Lyman Break Galaxies\n(LBGs) at z \u223c 4. The OPEGs are selected by optical colour\ncriteria (see \u00a73.1) being consistent with a passively evolving galaxy with the major star-formation epoch at z > 2.\nSince the age of the universe at z = 2 is only \u223c 2.3h\u22121 Gyrs,\nprogenitors of the OPEGs must have experienced an active\nstar formation phase at some high redshifts of z > 2. The\nLBGs, which are in general actively star forming galaxies at\nhigh redshifts, are naturally a strong candidate of a major\npopulation of the progenitor of such OPEGs. While there is\na fraction of dusty star-forming galaxies or red old galaxies with little star formation, which are not selected by the\nLBG criteria at z \u223c2\u20132.5 (e.g., Franx et al. 2003; Reddy\net al. 2005), LBGs are still most populous among them. In\naddition, the OPEGs are considered as strong candidates\nfor progenitors of the present-day early-type galaxies since\nthe simple passive evolution in their stellar populations can\neasily link between them. We examine relations between the\ntwo galaxy populations in terms of the evolution of hosting\ndark matter haloes. Our primary question addressed in this\npaper is \"supposing the LBGs are a major progenitor of the\nOPEGs, are their hosting halo masses compatible with the\nmass evolution of dark matter haloes in the CDM structure\nformation model ?\" Also, we discuss possible present-day\ndescendants of those high-z galaxies from the viewpoint of\nthe masses of hosting haloes.\nWe determine the clustering amplitude at large scales\nwith angular two-point correlation functions of the OPEGs\nand LBGs measured, with a good accuracy, from a wide field\n(1 deg2 ) deep imaging data-set of Subaru/XMM-Newton\nDeep Survey (SXDS). Multi-band colour selection tech-\n\nniques successfully isolate those galaxies with well calibrated\nredshift selection functions, which enable us to compute an\naccurate prediction for the corresponding dark matter angular correlation function via the Limber's projection. This\nlarge data-set and selection techniques allow us to compute\na large-scale galaxy bias in a robust manner. Comparing\nthe measured large-scale bias with the ones predicted by\nthe halo model, we place a limit on the hosting halo mass\nof galaxy populations. Here we adopt an empirically parameterized model for the halo occupation function (HOF)\nwhich describes statistical relations between galaxies and\ntheir hosting haloes. Then, utilizing the extended PressSchechter (EPS) prescriptions, we examine the evolution of\nhalo mass in the framework of the CDM model. In this way,\nwe compare hosting halo masses of each galaxy population\nat different redshift, and explore their connection.\nThe outline of this paper is as follows. Section 2 describes models and basic equations. Section 3 summarizes\nobservational data that are used to place a constraint on\nthe hosting halo mass. Results are presented in section 4.\nFinally, section 5 is devoted to a summary and discussion.\nThroughout this paper, we adopt a flat \u039bCDM cosmology with the matter density \u03a9m = 0.3, the cosmological constant \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, the Hubble constant H0 = 100h\nkm s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 with h = 0.7, and the normalization of the\nmatter power spectrum \u03c38 = 0.9. We adopt the fitting function of the CDM power spectrum of Bardeen et al. (1986).\nWe present magnitudes in the AB system.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nMODELS\nDark matter angular correlation function\n\nWe quantify a clustering amplitude of a population of galaxies by comparing their angular two-point correlation function with the corresponding dark matter correlation function. Let q(z) be a normalized redshift selection function of\na population of galaxies being considered, the dark matter\nangular two-point correlation function is computed from the\ndark matter power spectrum (PDM ) via the Limber projection (see e.g, chapter 2 of Bartelmann & Schneider 2001):\n\u03c9DM (\u03b8) =\n\nZ\n\ndr q 2 (r)\n\nZ\n\ndk\nk PDM (k, r) J0 [fK (r)\u03b8k],\n2\u03c0\n\n(1)\n\nwhere J0 (x) is the zeroth-order Bessel function of the first\nkind. For the spatially flat cosmology (\u03a9m + \u03a9\u039b = 1) as we\nconsider throughout the present paper, the radial function\nfK (r) is equivalent to r, and r R= r(z) is the radial comoving\nz\ndistance given by r(z) = c/H0 0 dz \u2032 [\u03a9m (1+z \u2032 )3 +\u03a9\u039b ]\u22121/2 .\nWe use the nonlinear fitting function of the CDM power\nspectrum by Peacock & Dodds (1996).\n\n2.2\n\nHalo model\n\nWe utilize the halo model approach for estimating a characteristic mass of hosting haloes from the measured clustering\namplitude of galaxies. Here, we summarize several expressions which are most relevant to the current analysis. See\nHamana et al.

For\nthe dependences of the HOF parameters on the shape of the\ntwo-point correlation function, see Hamana et al. (2004; and\nreferences therein).\nWe introduce the average mass of hosting halo\n(weighted by the number of member galaxy) by\nhMhost i =\n\nR\n\ndM M Ng (M )nhalo (M )\n\nR\n\ndM Ng (M )nhalo (M )\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere nhalo (M ) denotes the halo mass function for which\nwe adopt the fitting function of Sheth & Tormen (1999)\nSince the halo model assumes the linear halo bias (Mo &\nWhite 1996) and Ng (M ) solely depends on the halo mass,\nthe galaxy bias on large scales (the scales larger than the\nvirial radius of hosting haloes) is given by the galaxy number\nweighted halo bias:\nbg,L =\n\nR\n\ndM bhalo (M )Ng (M )nhalo (M )\n\nR\n\ndM Ng (M )nhalo (M )\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere bhalo (M ) is the halo bias, for which we adopt the\nfitting function of Sheth & Tormen (1999). Note that bg,L\ndoes not depend on M1 but only on Mmin and \u03b1.\nSince galaxies considered in the following sections are\ndistributed over a redshift interval, we take into account the\nredshift evolution of a quantity X(z) (represents for b2g,L or\nhMhost i) by computing its redshift average:\nX\u2261\n\nR\n\ndz [dV /dz] q(z)k X(z)\n\nR\n\ndz [dV /dz] q(z)k\n\n,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere k = 1 for hMhost i while k = 2 for b2g,L , and dV /dz\ndenotes the comoving volume element per unit solid angle:\ndV /dz = c/H0 r 2 [\u03a9m (1 + z)3 + \u03a9\u039b ]\u22121/2 , again for the spatially flat cosmology.\n\n2.3\n\nExtended Press-Schechter model\n\nThe extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism was developed by Bond et al. (1991), Bower (1991) and Lacey & Cole\n(1993). Since the EPS model provides a way to treat halo\nmergers, which play an important role in the structure formation in the hierarchical CDM model, it has been widely\napplied to analytical and semi-analytical studies of the structure formation. We utilize the EPS model for making a statistical estimate of growth of halo masses. A key expression\nfor this is the conditional probability P2 (Mt2 , z2 |Mt1 , z1 )\nthat a material in a halo of mass Mt1 at z1 will be in\na halo of mass Mt2 (Mt2 > Mt1 ) at a later redshift z2 ,\nleading to an expression for the conditional mass function\nn2 (Mt2 , z2 |Mt1 , z1 ).\nHere we summarize only expressions which are directly\nc 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201310\n\n3\n\nrelevant to our analysis, see above references for their derivation.

The limiting magnitudes for\nthe 3\u03c3 detection of an object in a 2 arcsec diameter aperture\nare B \u2243 28.3, R \u2243 27.6, i\u2032 \u2243 27.5 and z \u2032 \u2243 26.5 (Furusawa\net al. in preparation). The seeing size of those images is\n\u223c 0.8\u2032\u2032 . We avoid the edges of the field and the area affected\nby bright sources. The final effective area used in this paper\nis \u223c 1 deg2 .\nBelow we summarize basic properties of the two galaxy\nsamples, and present angular two-point correlation functions\nof those galaxies.\n3.1\n\nOld passively-evolving galaxies at z \u223c 1\n\nThe photometric properties of the old passively-evolving\ngalaxies (OPEGs) in the SXDS fields are presented in Kodama et al. (2004) and Yamada et al. (2005). For the sample\nselection of OPEGs, we follow the definition of Yamada et\nal. (2005) which imposes the two criteria: 0.8 < i\u2032 \u2212 z \u2032 < 1.2\nand \u22120.05z \u2032 +3.01 < R\u2212z \u2032 < \u22120.03z \u2032 +2.49, on the z \u2032 -band\nselected catalog. This criteria effectively isolate the galaxies\nwith star-formation epoch greater than zf > 2 and located\nat 0.9 < z < 1.1. This photometrically-selected sample is\ncomposed of 4,118 OPEG candidates with z \u2032 < 25.0 distributed in the effective area of 1.03 deg2 . It is found from\nthe spectroscopic observations for the 93 OPEG candidates\nwith 19 < z \u2032 < 22 that the 73 objects lie between z = 0.87\nand 1.12, and the 4 objects lie outside of the redshift interval,\nand the remaining 16 objects have undetermined redshift because of no usable feature in the spectrum or a poor S/N.\nFigure 8 of Yamada et al. (2005) shows the redshift distribution function of OPEGs obtained from the spectroscopicallyidentified objects. The contamination fraction is estimated\nto be between 0.05 (=4/[73+4]) and 0.22 (=20/93). We assume the contamination fraction of fC = 0.1 in the following analyses. The luminosity function is well fitted by the\n1 See http://www.naoj.org/Science/SubaruProject/SDS/ for details of the SXDS project.\n\n\f4\n\nT. Hamana et al.\n\nFigure 1.

Note that the plotted correlation function has been corrected for the contamination (see text). The dotted line shows\nthe CDM model prediction for the dark matter angular two-point\ncorrelation function computed via equation (1), where the nonlinear fitting function for the CDM power spectrum by Peacock\n& Dodds (1996) is used. Lower panel: The corresponding galaxy\nbias defined by equation (8) is plotted. The horizontal solid line\nshows the large-scale bias factor computed averaging the bias over\nan interval 1\u2032 < \u03b8 < 10\u2032 , and the dashed lines show its 1-\u03c3 error.\n\nSchechter function with \u03c6\u2217 = (4.26 \u00b1 0.42) \u00d7 10\u22123 h3 Mpc\u22123 ,\n\u03b1LF = \u22120.67 \u00b1 0.07 and MB\u2217 = \u221221.38 \u00b1 0.10 (Yamada et\nal. 2005). The latter magnitude corresponds to z\u2217\u2032 = 21.8 at\nz = 1.\nThe angular two-point correlation functions are computed using the pair-count estimator formulated by Landy\n& Szalay (1993): \u03c9g (\u03b8) = [DD(\u03b8)\u22122DR(\u03b8)+RR(\u03b8)]/RR(\u03b8).\nIn so doing, we distribute the same number of random samples with the same geometrical constraint as of the data\nsample. We repeat 100 random re-samplings, and the mean\nand RMS among the 100 measurements are taken as the\nmean correlation signal and 1-\u03c3 error. The effect of the contamination on the two-point correlation function is corrected\nby multiplying by a factor of 1/(1\u2212fC )2 , where the contaminants are assumed to be randomly distributed. A measured\nangular correlation function is plotted in the top panel of\nFigure 1 together with the dark-matter angular correlation\nfunction computed with the same redshift selection function.\nNote that the integral constraint (Groth & Peebles 1977) is\nestimated to be \u223c 7 \u00d7 10\u22123 for a single power-law model\n[\u03c9g (\u03b8) \u221d \u03b8\u03b2 ] with the power-law index of \u03b2 = \u22121, we may\nthus ignore an effect of a finite field size as far as \u03b8 < 10\u2032 is\nconcerned.\nWe define the galaxy bias by\nb(\u03b8) =\n\nr\n\n\u03c9g (\u03b8)\n,\n\u03c9DM (\u03b8)\n\n(8)\n\nFigure 2. Lower panel: The large-scale bias factor (see test for\nthe definition) for the OPEGs as a function of limiting magnitude. Upper panel: hMhost i computed from the halo model (with\na fixed \u03b1 = 0.8) for the corresponding large-scale bias factor (see\n\u00a74 for details). The upper abscissa axis indicates the magnitude\ndifference from the z\u2217\u2032 value.\n\nand is plotted in the bottom panel of Figure 1. As is\nshown there, on scales below \u223c 1 arcmin, the bias decreases\nwith the separation, while on larger scales it flattens. The\ncomoving angular length of the transition scale (\u223c1\u2032 ) is\n\u223c 0.7h\u22121 Mpc (at z = 1) which corresponds to the virial\nradius of the halo with the mass \u223c 2 \u00d7 1013 h\u22121 M\u2299 at z = 1.\nThis mass coincides with the characteristic mass of the hosting halo (hMhost i) predicted by the halo model analysis in\nthe next section. It may follow from this that the shape of\nthe bias function is basically understood by the standard\nhalo model picture: The small-scale clustering arises from\ngalaxy pairs located in the same halo, while the large-scale\nclustering arises from galaxy pairs located in two different\nhaloes.\nSince the measured bias flattens on large-scales as expected by the halo model, we define the large-scale bias factor (bL ) as an averaged bias over 1\u2032 < \u03b8 < 10\u2032 (illustrated in\nthe bottom panel of Figure 1). We compute the large-scale\nbias factor for OPEG samples with different limiting magnitudes and show in the bottom panel of Figure 2. Broadly\nspeaking, the large-scale bias factor is a decreasing function\nof the magnitude, though the significance is not high due to\nlarge error bars.\nLet us devote, in passing, a little space to compare our\nmeasurement with previous studies. We derive the comoving correlation length, r0 , from the power-law fitting model\nof the angular two-point correlation function with the Limber equation (Peebles 1980). The correlation length r0 is the\nnormalization of the spatial two-point correlation function,\n\u03be = (r/r0 )\u2212\u03b3 , where \u03b3 is related by \u03b3 = \u03b2 + 1. We find\nr0 = 4.7 \u00b1 0.3h\u22121 Mpc and 5.7 \u00b1 0.2h\u22121 Mpc with the bestfit beta (\u03b2 = 1.1) and the fixed beta (\u03b2 \u2261 0.8), respectively.\nc 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201310\n\n\fMasses and thier evolution of high-z galaxies in the CDM model\n\nFigure 3. Same as Figure 1 but for the LBGs with i\u2032 < 27.0(=\ni\u2032\u2217 + 2).\n\nThis is consistent with r0 = 5.0 \u00b1 0.3h\u22121 Mpc obtained from\n(R \u2212 I) colour selected red galaxies (I = 18 \u2212 24) at z \u223c 0.85\nmost of which have early-type spectra (Coil et al. 2004). In\ncontrast, it is much smaller than r0 = (8 \u2212 13)h\u22121 Mpc obtained from (optical\u2212NIR) colour selected \"Extremely Red\nObjects\" (EROs) at 1 . z . 2 (Daddi et al 2001; McCarthy et al. 2001; Firth et al. 2002; Roche et al. 2002;\nMiyazaki et al. 2003). The luminosity segregation of clustering may not explain the difference of r0 , since, if we assume\nan early-type spectrum, the limiting magnitudes of their\nERO searches reach to a comparable depth to our OPEG\nsample (z \u2032 < 23.8). The reason for the significant difference\nin r0 is not clear. Coil et al. (2004) suggest that their red\ngalaxies selected in optical bands may be a less-extreme version of EROs. Another possible reason would be an intrinsic\nevolution in the clustering strength due to the difference in\nredshift ranges of the samples. While our sample and Coil\net al.'s (2004) sample are both limited to the small redshift\nrange at z \u223c 1, other \"R \u2212 K\" or \"I \u2212 K\" EROs samples have much wider range in redshift up to z \u223c 2 The\nclustering strength of the red galaxies can evolve strongly\nbetween z \u223c 2 and 1. Furthermore, the SXDS survey probes\nmuch larger volume than the other surveys and the effect of\nfield-to-field variation is expected to relatively small. Further investigating into the origin of the difference is, however, beyond the scope of this paper, and we leave it for a\nfuture work.\n\n3.2\n\nLyman break galaxies at z \u223c 4\n\nThe sample selection and clustering properties of the Lyman\nbreak galaxies (LBGs) at z \u223c 4 are described in Ouchi et al.\n(2005). Briefly, the LBGs are selected from i\u2032 -band selected\ncatalog by three criteria: B \u2212 R > 1.2, R \u2212 i\u2032 < 0.7 and\nB \u2212 R > 1.6(R \u2212 i\u2032 ) + 1.9. The number counts of this samc 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201310\n\n5\n\nFigure 4. Same as Figure 2 but for the LBGs.\n\nple is given in Table 1 of Ouchi et al. (2005). The redshift\ndistribution function has the mean of z \u223c 4 and width of\n\u2206z \u223c 0.5 as is shown in the top panels of Figure 12 of Ouchi\net al. (2004a). It is found from the spectroscopic follow-up\nobservations for the 63 photometrically-selected LBGs that\nthe 60 objects lie between z = 3.5 and 4.5 (Ouchi et al.\n2005 and references therein). The contamination fraction is\nthus estimated to be fC = 0.05(= [63 \u2212 60]/63). Ouchi et\nal. (2004a) computed the luminosity function of the LBGs\nselected from the Subaru Deep field with the same colour\nselection criteria and have found i\u2032\u2217 = 25.0 \u00b1 0.1.\nThe angular two-point correlation functions of the\nLBGs are computed in the same procedure as was done for\nthe OPEGs and are plotted in the top panel of Figure 3. The\nintegral constraint is estimated to be \u223c 7 \u00d7 10\u22123 for a single power-law model with the power-law index of \u03b2 = \u22120.8,\nwe may thus ignore an effect of a finite field size as far as\n\u03b8 < 5\u2032 is concerned. The galaxy bias defined by equation (8)\nis plotted in the bottom panel. A transition from the smallscale decreasing part to the large-scale flat part is found at\nthe scale of \u223c10 arcsec (see Ouchi et al. 2005 for further detail discussions on the shape of the bias function. Note that\nthey do not correct for the effect of the contamination because of unknown clustering property of the contaminants,\nfor which we assume the random distribution. As a consequence, their measured biases are smaller than ours by\nabout 5 percents). This is transformed to the comoving angular scale of \u223c0.2h\u22121 Mpc at z = 4, which corresponds to\nthe virial radius of the halo with the mass \u223c 1\u00d71012 h\u22121 M\u2299 .\nThis mass, again, coincides with the characteristic mass of\nhosting haloes (hMhost i) predicted by the halo model analysis in the next section. Thus the behavior of the bias is\nunderstood by the standard halo model picture.\nThe large-scale bias factor is computed in the same\nmanner as was done for the OPEGs except for using a different separation range of 0.5\u2032 < \u03b8 < 5\u2032 (illustrated in the\n\n\f6\n\nT.

This is chosen so that\nit is well deeper than the m\u2217 value and at the same time\nit is well brighter than the completeness limit of our imaging data (z \u2032 \u2243 26.5 for the OPEGs and i\u2032 \u2243 27.5 for the\nLBGs). The former is imposed so that the samples do not\ncontain only the brightest objects, which would not be representative of the whole population. The latter is imposed to\nreduce contaminations due to errors in the luminosities and\ncolours. We note that the number densities of the subsamples are nOPEG (z \u2032 < 23.8) = (4.7\u00b10.47)\u00d710\u22123 h3 Mpc\u22123 and\nnLBG (i\u2032 < 27.0) = (1.1 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10\u22122 h3 Mpc\u22123 for OPEGs\nand LBGs, respectively. Therefore with this selection, the\nLBGs are as 2.3 times numerous as the OPEGs. It should\nbe noted that statistical properties (e.g., the number density\nand clustering amplitude) of a galaxy sample would be sensitive to the selection criteria (e.g., the magnitude limit and\n\n\u03b1=1\n\u03b1 = 0.8\n\u03b1=0\n\u03b1=1\n\u03b1 = 0.8\n\u03b1=0\n\n1.5 \u00d7 1013\n1.2 \u00d7 1013\n6.6 \u00d7 1012\n1.3 \u00d7 1012\n1.2 \u00d7 1012\n1.0 \u00d7 1012\n\n1-\u03c3(2)\n9.6 \u00d7 1012\n6.3 \u00d7 1012\n2.3 \u00d7 1012\n9.3 \u00d7 1011\n8.3 \u00d7 1011\n6.4 \u00d7 1011\n\n\u2212 2.2 \u00d7 1013\n\u2212 1.9 \u00d7 1013\n\u2212 1.3 \u00d7 1013\n\u2212 1.8 \u00d7 1012\n\u2212 1.7 \u00d7 1012\n\u2212 1.5 \u00d7 1012\n\ncolour selection). Therefore, when one attempts to compare\nproperties of two (or more) galaxy samples, it is necessary\nto properly define samples of galaxies with a quantity essential to their nature. In our case, the luminosity would\nbe the most relevant quantity among (a few) controllable\nparameters we have in hand. Since the definition of our subsamples is based on a somewhat arbitrary magnitude limit,\nwe shall look into an effect of this definition by changing the\nmagnitude limit for subsampling.\n4.1\n\nHalo model analyses\n\nWe estimate the hosting halo mass by comparing the measured large-scale bias factor with the halo model prediction.\nTo do this, we proceed as follows: First, we compute the\nhalo model prediction for the large-scale bias bg,L defined\nby equation (4) for a given value of \u03b1 as a function of Mmin\n(plotted in the lower panel of Figures 5 and 6). Then, searchc 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201310\n\n\fMasses and thier evolution of high-z galaxies in the CDM model\ning for an interval of Mmin , where the predicted bg,L and the\n1-\u03c3 interval of the measured large-scale bias factor intersect,\nwe have a constraint on Mmin . Since for a given \u03b1, hMhost i\nand Mmin have a one-to-one correspondence (see the upper\npanel of Figures 5 and 6), the constraint on Mmin is immediately translated into the constraint on hMhost i. We take\nthree values of \u03b1 = 1, 0.8 and 0. Here \u03b1 < 1 is preferred from\nsemi-analytic models of the galaxy formation (e.g., Kravtsov\net al. 2004), as well as from the halo model analysis for LBGs\n(Hamana et al. 2004). We take \u03b1 = 0.8 as a fiducial value.\nThe case \u03b1 = 0 corresponds to an extreme case where every\nhalo with a mass greater than Mmin always has one galaxy.\nThe constraints obtained for our fiducial galaxy samples\n(z \u2032 < 23.8 for the OPEGs and i\u2032 < 27.0 for the LBGs)\nare summarized in Table 1. It is important to notice that\nthe change in \u03b1 does not make a significant change in the\npreferred interval of hMhost i except for the extreme case of\n\u03b1 = 0 for the OPEGs. Therefore , the constraint is not very\nsensitive to the uncertainty in \u03b1.\nLet us look into how the characteristic hosting halo\nmass varies with the limiting magnitude for the sample selection. The upper panels of Figures 2 and 4 show the constraint on hMhost i as a function of the limiting magnitude.\nIn both galaxy populations, a trend of decreasing hMhost i\nfor a fainter limiting magnitude is observed. These similarlooking trends, however, may arise from different physical\norigins as explained below. First, for the OPEGs, the observed z \u2032 -band corresponds approximately to the rest-frame\nB-band. Although the B-band luminosity is affected by ongoing/recent star formation, only a weak star formation activity would make the colour of galaxy blue and pushes it\noutside of our OPEG selection criteria (Yamada et al. 2005).\nTherefore the B-band luminosity is a good measure of the\nstellar mass of the OPEGs. Accordingly, the observed trend\nis considered as a result of a correlation between the stellar mass and the hosting halo mass. On the other hand, for\nthe LBGs, the observed i\u2032 -band corresponds to \u223c1500\u00c5 in\nthe rest-frame, where the luminosity is most sensitive to the\nstar formation. The LBGs are generally in an active star formation phase, also it was reported that the stellar mass of\nLBGs is poorly correlated with the UV luminosity (Shapley\net al. 2001). Therefore, the observed luminosity dependence\nof hosting halo mass of LBGs may suggest a presence of\na correlation between the hosting halo mass and the star\nformation activity.\n4.2\n\nEPS model analyses\n\nWe use the conditional mass function n2 (Mt2 , z2 |Mt1 , z1 )\n(equation 7) derived from the EPS formalism to predict the\nmass evolution of hosting haloes in the framework of the\nCDM cosmology. For the parameters of the haloes at earlier\nepoch z1 , we take the 1-\u03c3 interval of hMhost i obtained from\nthe halo model analysis with \u03b1 = 0.8 as a range of Mt1 ,\nand we set z1 = 4 and z1 = 1 for the LBGs and OPEGs,\nrespectively. Then for a certain later epoch z2 , we compute\nn2 (Mt2 , z2 |Mt1 , z1 ) as a function of Mt2 (see inserts of Figures 7\u20139 for examples). Assuming that the mass assembly\nhistory of hosting haloes is not biased toward any specific\nmerging path, the conditional mass function can be regarded\nas the probability distribution function (PDF) of the mass\nof descendant haloes Mt2 . We define a 68% confidence inc 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201310\n\n7\n\nFigure 7. Inserts show arbitrary normalized conditional mass\nfunctions n2 (Mt2 , z2 |Mt1 , z1 ) for z2 = 1 (left panel) and 0 (right\npanel), where parameters of the earlier halo is taken from the\nlimit obtained by the halo model analysis of the LBGs (with\n\u03b1 = 0.8): z1 = 4, Mt1 = 1.2 \u00d7 1012 h\u22121 M\u2299 (red), 8.3 \u00d7 1011\n(blue), and 1.7 \u00d7 1012 (green). These conditional mass functions\nare considered as the probability distribution function of the mass\nof the descendant. The main plot shows 68% confidence intervals\nof Mt2 as a function of the redshift (z2 ). Three intervals shown by\ncoloured hatches are for the same three Mt1 values as the inserts.\nFilled circles with error bars show the limits of hMhost i obtained\nfrom the halo model analysis (with \u03b1 = 0.8) for the LBGs and\nOPEGs.\n\nterval of Mt2 as the EPS model prediction for the mass of\nthe descendant halo.\nSuch predictions are made for our LBGs and OPEGs\nsamples. and are shown in Figures 7\u20139 as hatched regions.\nThree tracks correspond to the three different values of Mt1\ntaken from the mean and upper/lower 1-\u03c3 values for the\nhMhost i denoted by the symbols with error bars (\u03b1 = 0.8\ncases in Table 1). The inserts show the PDFs of Mt2 at\nz = 0 (and z = 1). It is observed in the inserts that the\nPDFs have a wide spread, implying a wide variety of the\nmass assembly history of hosting haloes. We note that since\nthe PDFs are skewed toward a larger mass, the mean of the\ndistribution is greater than the mode.\nLet us look closely at each result. First of all, Figure 7\ncompares the expected descendant mass of hosting haloes of\nthe LBGs with the hMhost i of OPEGs. Both galaxy samples\nare selected with our fiducial magnitude limit of m < m\u2217 +2.\nAs is evidently shown, the EPS predictions for the mass of\nthe LBG descendant are slightly smaller than the predicted\nmass range of the OPEGs, only the track from the upper\nlimit of the LBG haloes is compatible with the OPEGs.\nIs there a selection criterion for LBGs or for OPEGs\nwhich results in a better agreement? It is found from the\nupper panel of Fig. 2 that choosing a fainter limiting magnitude for the OPEG sample lowers the hMhost i very little\nand can hardly solve the incompatibility. On the other hand,\nchoosing a brighter limiting magnitude for the LBG sample\nraises the hMhost i as shown in the upper panel of Figure 4.\nIndeed, the galaxy sample selected with i\u2032 < 26.0(= i\u2032\u2217 + 1)\nresults in a very compatible halo mass with the hMhost i of\nthe OPEGs (with z \u2032 < 23.8) as shown in Figure 8. Therefore, in the view of the mass evolution of hosting haloes, it\n\n\f8\n\nT. Hamana et al.\n\nFigure 8. Same as Figure 7 but the LBGs sample is selected with\ni\u2032 < 26.0. The limit of hMhost i obtained from the halo model\nanalysis with \u03b1 = 0.8, which is taken by Mt1 , is Mt1 = 2.2 \u00d7\n1012 h\u22121 M\u2299 (red), 1.2 \u00d7 1012 (blue), and 3.7 \u00d7 1012 (green).\n\nFigure 9. Same as Figure 7 but the limit for OPEGs obtained\nfrom the halo model analysis (with \u03b1 = 0.8) is taken by parameters of the earlier halo: z1 = 1, Mt1 = 1.2 \u00d7 1013 h\u22121 M\u2299 (red),\n6.3 \u00d7 1012 (blue), and 1.9 \u00d7 1014 (green). In the insert, z2 is taken\nby 0.\n\nmay be safely concluded that the bright (i\u2032 . i\u2032\u2217 + 1) LBGs\nare consistent with being the progenitor of the OPEGs,\nwhereas it seems less likely that the LBGs population,\nas a whole, has evolved into the OPEG population. Note\nthat the corresponding number density is computed to be\nnLBG (i\u2032 < 26.0) \u2243 (3.8 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 10\u22123 h3 Mpc\u22123 , closer to the\nnumber density of nOPEG (z \u2032 < 23.8).\n\n4.3\n\nPredictions for the present-day descendants\n\nTurn next to predictions for the present-day descendants of\nthe two galaxy populations plotted in Figures 7\u20139. As is\nshown in the inserts of Figures 7 and 8, the PDF of the\npresent-day descendants of the LBGs have a very broad\nspread due to the wide variety of the mass assembly history\nover \u223c 8h\u22121 Gyrs. The predicted mass range for the LBG\nsample with i\u2032 < 27.0 is broadly consistent with that of the\nOPEGs, though the PDF of the LBGs extends to a smaller\nmass (say M < 1013 h\u22121 M\u2299 ) where the PDF of the OPEGs\nhas little probability. On the other hand, the predicted mass\nrange for the LBG sample with i\u2032 < 26.0 agrees better with\nthat of the OPEG descendants. In this case, both the PDFs\ncomputed from the central hMhost i value (the middle one of\nthe three cases in the inserts) peak at \u223c 2 \u00d7 1013 h\u22121 M\u2299 ,\nwhich corresponds to the mass scale of groups of galaxies. It\nis important to note that since the PDFs are skewed strongly\ntoward a larger mass, a certain fraction of haloes is expected\nto evolved into more massive haloes with Mt2 & 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299\n(see the inserts of Figures 8 and 9).\nIt is interesting to compare those EPS predictions for\nthe halo masses of the present-day descendants with local\ngalaxy samples. Since both the LBGs and OPEGs are frequently argued as the strong candidates for the progenitor\nof the present-day early-type galaxies, we take two clustering analyses of the early-type galaxy samples: One from the\nthe 2dF (Madgwick et al. 2003), and the other from the\nSDSS (Zehavi et al. 2002). Madgwick et al. (2003) found\n\u03c38NL \u2243 1.1 \u00b1 0.1 for \"passive\" galaxies, of which the luminosity range is \u221216.5 < MbJ \u2212 5 log h < \u221222 with\nMbJ ,\u2217 = \u221219.7. Here \u03c38NL is the RMS of counts of galaxies\n\nFigure 10. The halo model prediction for the large-scale galaxy\nbias bg,L as a function of the averaged halo mass hMhost i at\nz = 0.1. Curves are for a different value of \u03b1 (\u03b1 = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75\nand 1 from upper to lower). Open circles indicate a corresponding value for Mmin in intervals of \u2206 log Mmin = 1 staring from\nMmin = 108 h\u22121 M\u2299 with Mmin = 1012 h\u22121 M\u2299 being marked by\nthe filled circles.\n\nin spheres of 8h\u22121 Mpc radius and is derived from the bestfitting power-law model of the real-space correlation function \u03be = (r0 /8)\u03b3 via the relation (\u03c38NL )2 = J2 (\u03b3)(r0 /8)\u03b3 with\nJ2 (\u03b3) = 72/[(3 \u2212 \u03b3)(4 \u2212 \u03b3)(6 \u2212 \u03b3)2\u03b3 ] (Peebles 1980). Since\n\u03c38NL of the dark matter is \u03c38NL \u2243 0.9 at z = 0.1 (the mean\nredshift of the galaxy samples considered here) for \u03c38 = 0.9\n(note that \u03c38 is the linearly extrapolated value at z = 0), the\ncorresponding bias is found to be bg,L \u2243 1.2 \u00b1 0.1. Following\nthe same procedure, we estimate \u03c38NL of galaxy samples from\nc 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201310\n\n\fMasses and thier evolution of high-z galaxies in the CDM model\nthe SDSS. Adopting the best-fitting power-law models given\nin Table 2 of Zehavi et al. (2002), we find \u03c38NL = 1.2\u00b10.03 for\ntheir both \"red\" (defined by u \u2212 r > 1.8) and \"high concentration\" (c = r90 /r50 > 2.7) samples, giving bg,L \u2243 1.3\u00b10.03\nfor z = 0.1 (the mean redshift of the samples). The luminosity range of those galaxies is \u221222 < Mr \u2212 5 log h < \u221219\nwith Mr,\u2217 = \u221220.8. Comparing those bias values (i.e.,\nbg,L = 1.1 \u2212 1.33) with the halo model predictions plotted in Figure10, we find hMhalo i = (2 \u2212 6) \u00d7 1013 h\u22121 M\u2299 for\n0.25 . \u03b1 . 0.75 (Note that as is shown Figure10, the relation between the large-scale bias and hMhalo i only weakly\ndepends on \u03b1). This is broadly consistent with the EPS predictions for the descendants of the OPEGs (with z \u2032 < 23.8 )\nand also with that of the LBGs (with i\u2032 < 26.0). Therefore,\nwe may conclude that, in the viewpoint of the mass evolution of hosting haloes in the CDM model, the OPEGs and\nthe bright LBGs are consistent with being the progenitor of\nthe present-day early-type galaxies.\n\n5\n\nSUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS\n\nWe have analyzed the two photometrically-selected galaxy\nsamples from the deep mult-band images of the SXDS: the\nLBGs at z \u223c 4 and OPEGs at z \u223c 1. The contiguous large\nsurvey area of the SXDS enables us to measure the angular two-point correlation functions over a wide range of\nseparations with a good statistical quality. Comparing the\nlarge-scale clustering amplitude with the corresponding halo\nmodel predictions, we have estimated a characteristic mass\nof hosting haloes. Then, adopting the EPS model, we have\ncomputed the predictions for the mass evolution of the hosting haloes to explore the likely descendants of those galaxy\nsamples. In particular, we have compared the predicted halo\nmasses of these two populations at different epochs to make\na possible evolutionary link. We have also examined expected halo masses of the present-day descendants of those\ntwo galaxy populations.\nOur major findings are summarized as follows:\n(i) The measured bias functions (defined by equation 8)\nof both the OPEGs and LBGs consist of two parts: The\ndecreasing small-scale part and the flat large-scale part. The\ntransition scales between them are 1\u2032 and 10\u2032\u2032 for the OPEGs\nand LBGs, respectively. Those scales agree well with the\nvirial radii of haloes with the characteristic mass of hosting\nhaloes predicted by the halo model analysis in \u00a74. The shape\nof the bias function is thus understood by the standard halo\nmodel picture: The small-scale clustering arises from galaxy\npairs located in the same halo, and the large-scale clustering\narises from galaxy pairs located in two different haloes.\n(ii) The conclusive measurement of the flat large-scale\nbias allows us to safely define the large-scale bias factor.\nAlso, the large number of galaxies allows us to examine the\nluminosity dependence of the large-scale bias factor. It is\nfound that the large-scale bias factors of both OPEGs and\nLBGs positively correlates with the luminosity (see bottom\npanels of Figures 2 and 4).\n(iii) Comparing the measured large-scale bias factors of\nthe two galaxy samples with the halo model predictions,\nwe estimate the characteristic mass of hosting haloes. The\nmerit of using the large-scale bias factor is two-fold: First\nis concerning the measurement; since many bins are used to\nc 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201310\n\n9\n\ncompute it, the measurement is less sensitive to a statistical\nnoise in each bin. Second is concerning the halo model; the\nlarge-scale bias does not depend on M1 , and in addition, the\nresultant hMhalo i is less sensitive to \u03b1. Therefore it provides\nwith a reliable estimate of hMhalo i. The predicted characteristic halo masses of both galaxy samples are found to be positively correlated with the luminosity. For the OPEGs, this\nmay arise from a correlation between the stellar mass and\nthe hosting halo mass, because the observed z \u2032 -band magnitude (rest-frame B-band) is well correlated to the stellar\nmass for population like OPEGs with little star formation\nactivity. On the other hand, for the LBGs, it may suggest\na correlation between the hosting halo mass and the star\nformation activity, rather than the stellar mass. This is because the observed i\u2032 -band corresponds to \u223c1500\u00c5 in the\nrest-frame, where the luminosity is most sensitive to the\nstar formation, and in addition, the LBGs are generally in\nan active star formation phase.\n(iv) Utilizing the EPS model, we compute the predictions\nfor the halo mass distribution of the LBGs' descendants at\nz = 1 in the CDM cosmology, and then we compare it with\nthe halo model prediction for the characteristic halo mass of\nthe OPEGs. It is found that, for our fiducial subsamples (the\nOPEGs with z \u2032 < 23.8 and the LBGs with i\u2032 < 27.0), the\ntypical hosting halo mass of LBGs' descendants is slightly\nsmaller than the predicted mass of the OPEGs' hosting\nhaloes. It is also found that the brighter LBG subsample\n(with i\u2032 . 26.0) is likely to evolve into the systems with\nhalo mass compatible to the predicted one of the OPEGs.\nTherefore, we may conclude that, in the viewpoint of the\nmass evolution of hosting haloes in the framework of the\nCDM model, the bright (i\u2032 . i\u2032\u2217 + 1) LBGs are consistent\nwith being the progenitor of the OPEGs. Accordingly, it\nseems less likely that the LBGs population, as a whole, has\nevolved into the OPEG population.\n(v) We also compute predictions for halo masses of the\npresent-day descendants of both the galaxy samples using\nthe EPS model. It is found that the predicted mass range\nfor the LBG sample with i\u2032 < 27.0 is slightly but systematically smaller than that of the OPEGs (with z \u2032 < 23.8).\nOn the other hand, the prediction for the LBG sample with\ni\u2032 < 26.0 agrees better with that of the OPEG descendants.\nIn the latter case, the peaks of the PDFs are located at\n\u223c 2 \u00d7 1013 h\u22121 M\u2299 and the tail of the PDFs extends to the\nmass range of M > 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 . Thus the present-day descendants of the bright LBGs and the OPEGs are likely\nto be located in massive systems such like groups of galaxies or clusters of galaxies. We also estimate the characteristic halo mass of local early-type galaxy samples from the\n2dF and SDSS with the halo model, and it turns out that\nthe predicted mass is in good agreement with the EPS predictions for the present-day descendant's mass of both the\nbright LBGs and OPEGs. Therefore, it is concluded that,\nin the viewpoint of the mass evolution of hosting haloes in\nthe CDM model, the OPEGs and bright LBGs are consistent with being the progenitor of the present-day early-type\ngalaxies.\nOne of the most interesting implications from the above\nfindings is that the possible halo mass dependence of the\nLBG's star formation history. This is speculated from the\nabove finding (iv) that the predicted descendant's halo mass\n\n\f10\n\nT. Hamana et al.\n\nof bright LBG subsample (i\u2032 . i\u2032\u2217 + 1) is found to be in\nvery good agreement with the characteristic halo mass of\nthe OPEGs, whereas it seems less likely that the faint LBG\npopulation has evolved into the OPEG population. The nature of the descendants of the faint LBGs at z \u2243 1 is not\nclear but is naively expected that they evolve into other\npopulations than old passively evolving galaxies with lower\nmass and bluer spectra. It is important to notice that a little\nstar formation at z < 2 would be enough to push the galaxy\ncolour outside of the OPEG's colour criteria (Yamada et al.\n2005). Therefore, the halo mass dependence of the epoch\nof truncation in star formation activity is one possibility\nof interpreting the finding (iv). It is also found that the\nUV luminosity of the LBGs correlates with the hosting halo\nmass [the above finding (iii)]. This may be an additional evidence for the mass dependent star formation history, though\na connection between the above two findings, (iii) and (iv),\nis not clear. A possible scenario is that LBGs in more massive haloes have more active star formation at significantly\nhigh redshift such as z \u223c 4, and they turn into the passive evolution phase earlier. This scenario can be tested by\nperforming the same clustering analysis as presented in this\npaper progressively toward lower (and higher) redshifts. We\nmight be able to see the transition at some point where star\nformation activities in massive haloes are truncated and the\nmass of the haloes that are hosting active star formation is\nbeing shifted to lower mass as time progresses. At the same\ntime, on the theoretical side, we should explore a possible\nphysical mechanism that drives such mass dependent star\nformation histories.\nBefore closing, it is important to note that we have not\nargued that LBGs are the only path to become OPEGs\nat z = 1 or the present-day early-type galaxies. In fact,\nit is likely that the ancestor\u2013descendant connection is not a\none-to-one correspondence, and some different high-z galaxy\npopulations may have evolved into a similar low-z population, and vice versa. For example, among the ancestors of\nthe OPEGs at z = 1, there may be some haloes which have\nnot collpased by z = 4 and would be seen as LBGs at some\nlater epochs, as well as the objects which are not UV luminous enough to be selected as LBGs at z = 4 due to large\namount of dust extinction and/or older stellar ages. This is\none reason why we have not take into account the number\ndensity of our galaxy samples when we examine their possible connection. We note, however, the number density of\nthe bright LBGs nLBG (i\u2032 < 26.0) \u2243 3.8 \u00d7 10\u22123 h3 Mpc\u22123 is\nin fact comparable to that of OPEGs nOPEG (z \u2032 < 23.8) \u2243\n4.7\u00d710\u22123 h3 Mpc\u22123 . Therefore, we could even argue from this\ncomparison that the bright LBG\u2013OPEG connection could\nbe the major ancestor\u2013descendant relation if the number\ndensity of bright LBGs would not decrease significantly by\nmergers.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\ncarried out at ADAC (the Astronomical Data Analysis Center) of the National Astronomical Observatory, Japan.\n\nREFERENCES\nAdelberger K.
