Imaged with the first generation of infrared cameras, this companion to the white\ndwarf GD165 went without proper classification for several years. The L dwarf prototype,\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nGD165B came to represent the first new class of main sequence stars in 100 years, a class\nbelieved to retain both stellar and substellar objects over the age of the Galaxy (Burrows et\nal. 1997; Kirpatrick et al. 1999; Kirkpatrick et al. 2000; Burgasser et al. 2003). Since that\ntime, over two hundred and fifty objects of this spectral type have been discovered. Rather\nubiquitous in the field and in young clusters, L dwarfs have remained relatively infrequent\ncompanions to stars with M & 0.2M\u2299 (Zuckerman & Becklin 1987, 1992; Schroeder et\nal. 2000; Oppenheimer et al. 2001; Hinz et al. 2002; Farihi, Becklin, & Zuckerman 2003;\nMcCarthy & Zuckerman 2004). Understanding the overall statistics and individual properties\nof the lowest mass companion systems is important for both star and planet formation.\nThis paper describes the properties of a very cool companion to the white dwarf GD1400\n(WD0145-221, 01h 47m 21.8s , \u221221\u25e6 56\u2032 51.4\u2032\u2032 Eq. J2000). Spectroscopic and photometric\nevidence is presented that indicates the presence of a low mass, L type dwarf within 0.3\u2032\u2032 of\nthe primary.\n\n2.\n\nOBSERVATIONS & DATA\n2.1.\n\nV Band Photometry\n\nOptical V band data were taken 3 January 2004 with the CCD Camera on the Nickel 1\nmeter telescope at Lick Observatory. GD1400 and a nearby Tycho 2 catalog star (TYC4688111-1) were both observed for a total of 3 minutes, each in 3 separate 1 minute exposures,\nyielding SNR \u223c 240 on GD1400 and SNR \u223c 7000 on the V = 11.24 mag calibrator (H\u00f8g et\nal. 2000; Bessell 2000). Conditions were clear but with poor seeing (\u03b8 \u223c 4.5\u2032\u2032 ) that appeared\nto remain relatively stable between target and calibrator observations. The individual frames\nwere bias subtracted, flat fielded, registered and then averaged to create a single reduced\nimage upon which to perform photometric measurements.\nPhotometry was executed with 10\u2032\u2032 and 20\u2032\u2032 diameter apertures on both GD1400 and\ncalibrator, including telluric extinction corrections, producing consistent results to within\n0.01 mag. The error in the measured flux of each object was < 0.01 mag. The published\nuncertainty in the magnitude of TYC4688-111-1 is 0.12 mag (H\u00f8g et al. 2000). The result\nfor GD1400 is V = 14.85 \u00b1 0.12 mag.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n2.2.\n\nK Band Spectroscopy\n\nGD1400 was observed on 16 January 2004, using the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSPEC, McLean et al. 1998) at Keck Observatory. NIRSPEC was used in low resolution mode\nwith a 0.76\u2032\u2032 slit, yielding a spectral resolution of \u03bb/\u2206\u03bb \u223c 1500. The seeing was poor during\nthe observations (\u03b8 \u223c 1.2\u2032\u2032 at K) and the telescope suffered from significant windshake at the\nlocation of GD1400, so no companion was resolved, nor was any elongation detected except\ndue to the effects of windshake.\nTwo 10 minute spectra (dithered by 15\u2032\u2032 for sky subtraction) were obtained in K band\nusing the N7 filter, which yielded a wavelength coverage of 2.04 \u2212 2.45\u03bcm. The observations\nhad a fixed position angle on the sky of 38\u25e6 . HD63586, an A0V star, was observed at similar\nairmass for atmospheric calibration.\nThe spectrum of GD1400 was reduced using the REDSPEC data reduction package.\nThe images were cleaned of bad pixels, flat fielded, pair subtracted, and spatially rectified.\nTwo spectra of GD1400 were extracted, averaged, divided by the calibrator spectrum (scaled\nby a blackbody), wavelength calibrated and normalized. The average of the two spectra is\nshown in Figure 1.\n\n3.\n\nRESULTS\n\nAn unresolved companion was suspected based on the optical and near infrared data\navailable on GD1400. In the following sections, evidence is presented that reveals a low mass\ncompanion causing excess emission at 2.2\u03bcm.\n\n3.1.\n\nJ & K Magnitudes and Color\n\nThere exist two independent spectroscopic analyses of the hydrogen rich (DA) white\ndwarf GD1400. Both Koester et al. (2001) and Fontaine et al. (2003) give results based\non high resolution spectroscopy that agree quite well; Teff = 11, 605 K, log g = 8.05 and\nTeff = 11, 550 K, log g = 8.14 respectively. The average and standard deviation of these two\nresults (11, 580 \u00b1 40 K, log g = 8.10 \u00b1 0.06) were used to predict model colors and absolute\nmagnitudes, with errors, for GD1400 (Bergeron, Wesemael, & Beauchamp 1995).\nBefore considering distances and absolute magnitudes for GD1400B, the flux ratio of\nprimary and secondary should be considered. Based on the measured V magnitude and\nthe V \u2212 K = \u22120.24 model predicted color for GD1400, the predicted K magnitude is\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nK = 15.09 \u00b1 0.12 mag (model predicted color has less than 0.01 mag uncertainty and is\nessentially independent of surface gravity \u2013 the error is all measurement error in V ). The\n2MASS point source catalog gives a SNR=19.2 measurement of Ks = 14.34 \u00b1 0.06 mag for\nthe composite pair. Ignoring corrections between 2.2\u03bcm filter sets, a deconvolved magnitude\nof K = 15.10 \u00b1 0.20 mag is calculated for the companion. If the white dwarf models are\naccurate, the companion and primary appear equally luminous at this wavelength.\nThere is little or no excess emission measured for GD1400 at 1.2\u03bcm, which is consistent with a very red color of J \u2212 K & 2.0 for its companion (Table 1); consistent with a\nspectral type of L5.5 or later (Kirkpatrick et al. 2000; Dahn et al. 2002). Within the uncertainties of the 2MASS measured J magnitude of the composite and the white dwarf model\nextrapolation, it is possible that the companion J band flux is undetected.\nThe radius of GD1400, which has been determined spectroscopically by two independent\nmeasurements, can be used to estimate an absolute magnitude for GD1400B. At an assumed\n39 pc photometric distance for GD1400 (based on the model predicted absolute magnitude of\nMV = 11.88 \u00b1 0.10 mag for the white dwarf) an absolute K magnitude of MK = 12.13 \u00b1 0.22\nmag is determined for the L dwarf companion. These data are most compatible with spectral\ntype L6 and Teff \u223c 1650 K for GD1400B (Reid et al. 1999; Kirkpatrick et al. 2000; Dahn et\nal. 2002).\n\n3.2.\n\nA Comparison with the GD165 Binary System\n\nCoincidentally, the GD165 system (DA4.2+dL4), which has a white dwarf primary\nwith similar temperature and surface gravity to GD1400, will serve as a useful guide and\ncomparator for the following analysis. There are two independent spectroscopic parameter\ndeterminations for GD165. Both Koester et al. (2001) and Bergeron et al. (1995) give similar\nresults; Teff = 11, 970 K, log g = 7.91 and Teff = 11, 980 K, log g = 8.06, respectively. Also,\nGD165 has a trigonometric parallax which places it at 31.5 pc. The difference between the\nmodel predicted versus measured absolute magnitudes for GD165A are 0.06 mag at V , 0.03\nmag at J and 0.04 mag at K (Bergeron, Wesemael, & Beauchamp 1995; Bergeron et al.\n1995; Becklin & Zuckerman. 1988). Hence the models appear quite accurate in this case.\nIn contrast to the equally luminous components of the GD1400 system, GD165B is\n0.41 mag brighter than its white dwarf primary at K. Provided that brown dwarfs and the\nlowest mass stars all have radii near 1RJ after 1 Gyr (Burrows et al. 2001), GD1400B appears\ncooler than the L4 dwarf GD165B. The total J band flux of the GD1400 system is consistent\n(within the errors) with a single star, yet the combined J band flux of both components of\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nthe GD165 system is 0.29 mag brighter than the flux from the white dwarf alone (Bergeron,\nWesemael, & Beauchamp 1995). Again, if the white dwarf and brown dwarf models used\nhere are accurate, GD1400B appears to be cooler than GD165B.\nAlthough this photometric evidence points to an object cooler than GD165B, there is\nstill room for some error in the models and perhaps even in the spectroscopy of the primary\nwhite dwarf. The GD1400 system is unresolved and there currently exists no trigonometric\nparallax.\n\n3.3.\n\nK Band Spectrum\n\nNear infrared spectroscopy was performed to examine the possibility of a red background object or dust as the cause of the excess emission seen at 2.2\u03bcm. The 2.1 \u2212 2.4\u03bcm\nspectrum of GD1400 is shown in Figure 1. The two features seen at 2.29\u03bcm and 2.32\u03bcm\nare CO bandheads, which are indicative of a low mass companion and readily visible in this\ncomposite spectrum. An 11,500 K blackbody spectrum, scaled to have exactly half the flux\nof the composite at 2.20\u03bcm, was subtracted from the spectrum in Figure 1, thus effectively\nremoving the expected contribution from the featureless white dwarf at these wavelengths.\nThe resulting spectrum is shown in Figure 2.\nIn the subtracted spectrum, both CO bandheads have SNR > 25. Figure 3 shows the\nequivalent widths of these features for several M and L dwarfs from Cushing (2000) together\nwith GD1400B \u2013 all measured in a uniform way for this work. The equivalent widths for\nGD1400B appear stronger than those of known single L and M dwarfs. Oversubtraction\nof the white dwarf continuum from the composite spectrum could, in principle, cause the\nmeasured CO bandhead equivalent widths to be larger than their intrinsic values. Another\npossibility is close binary interactions, such as heating of the companion by the white dwarf.\nFurther observations are necessary to reconcile this apparent anomaly.\nThere is an absence of Na at 2.21\u03bcm, which can be seen weakly as late as spectral type\nL2, but not later. Equivalent widths vary between 0.2 \u2212 3.0 \u00c5 for early L dwarfs (McLean\net al. 2003; Cushing 2000). A measurement of this region in the spectrum of GD1400B is\nconsistent with an equivalent width of < 1.0 \u00c5. The noise in the region from 2.19 \u2212 2.23\u03bcm\nis 0.040 flux units per resolution element and the Na line typically has a full width of \u223c 50\n\u00c5 (McLean et al. 2003; Cushing 2000) in late M dwarfs, or roughly 5 resolution elements of\n2.6 pixels each. Hence, an equivalent width as small as 1.0 \u00c5 could have been detected at\nthe 1\u03c3 level. The lack of Na is inconsistent with an M dwarf.\nThe conclusion based on spectroscopy alone is that an early L type cannot be ruled\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nout with confidence. Although the equivalent widths of the first and second CO bandheads\nare larger than those seen in single L and late M dwarfs, this could be due to close binary\ninteractions or model uncertainties which led to oversubtraction of the white dwarf flux. The\nfact that Na is not manifest in the spectrum may be at odds with the CO equivalent widths,\nbut is consistent with the photometry.\n\n4.\n4.1.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe Age & Mass of GD1400B\n\nGD1400, a 0.67M\u2299 white dwarf, has been cooling for 0.51 Gyr according to models (P.\nBergeron 2002, private communication). From the initial to final mass relation for white\ndwarfs (Weidemann 1987, 1990, 2000; Bragaglia, Renzini, & Bergeron 1995), a white dwarf\nwith this mass has evolved from a main sequence progenitor with a mass in the range\n2.5M\u2299 \u2212 3.0M\u2299 . The main sequence lifetime then falls within the range 0.5 \u2212 1.0 Gyr\n(Maeder 1989), yielding a total age between 1.0 \u2212 1.5 Gyr. The very moderate proper\nmotion of GD1400, \u03bc \u2248 0.05\u2032\u2032 yr\u22121 (Zacharias et al. 2004), also supports the conclusion that\nthis is a relatively young system. Assuming vrad = 0, its Galactic space velocity relative to\nthe LSR is (U, V, W ) = (\u22124, +5, +9) km s\u22121 (U is taken to be positive toward the Galactic\nanticenter, V positive in the direction of Galactic rotation, and W positive toward the North\nGalactic Pole), with a total space motion of only 9 km s\u22121 with respect to the Sun \u2013 typical\nof young disk objects (Mihalas & Binney 1981; Leggett 1992). At 1.25 Gyr, a Teff \u223c 1650 K\nbrown dwarf is predicted to have M \u2248 60MJ (Chabrier et al. 2000).\n\n4.2.\n\nOrigin & Evolution of the GD1400 Binary System\n\nThe orbital separation of GD1400B is uncertain. The system remained unresolved in\nsubsequent NIRSPEC K band images taken two weeks after the spectrum was obtained.\nThe image with the best spatial resolution reveals a full width of \u03b8 = 0.82\u2032\u2032 and a sufficiently\nsymmetric PSF to rule out an equally luminous binary with separation & 0.3\u2032\u2032 . Although\nthere is the possibility of a chance alignment, the most likely explanation for the unresolved\nnature of the binary is a relatively small, a < 12 AU, semimajor axis.\nDuring the AGB phase of stellar evolution, orbiting bodies outside of \u223c 5 AU should\neschew the expanding envelope and eventually have their semimajor axes expanded by a\nfactor (typically 3 to 5) related to the mass lost (Jeans 1924; Zuckerman & Becklin 1987).\nInside of \u223c 5 AU, a companion should inspiral due to tidal and frictional interaction with\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nthe slow AGB wind and expanding photosphere (Debes & Sigurdsson 2002). Hence, it is\nlikely that the semimajor axis of GD1400B's orbit is less than a few AU. A sensitive search\nfor radial velocity variations might be able to confirm or rule out a close binary system.\n\n5.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nBased on photometric data presented here, the first unambiguous substellar companion\nto a white dwarf may have been discovered within 0.3\u2032\u2032 (\u223c 12 AU) of GD1400 (DA4.4).\nHowever, the near infrared spectroscopy may indicate a CO temperature that is higher than\nthe photospheric temperature indicated by the photometry. This could be the result of close\nbinary interactions causing the CO bandheads to appear more strongly than in isolated L\ndwarfs or may be due to errors in the models used to remove the flux of the primary.\nFrom a direct comparison with the GD165 binary system (relying on the same white\ndwarf and brown dwarf models), it appears that GD1400B is cooler than spectral type L4.\nThe deconvolved magnitudes and colors of GD1400B are most consistent with spectral type\nL6, indicative of a 60MJ brown dwarf at an estimated age of 1.25 Gyr. Its true nature\nand origins remain uncertain until more is known about the binary system. A trigonometic\nparallax determination, radial velocity measurements, or very high resolution imaging should\nbe able to further constrain the properties of this system.\nBoth authors owe a debt of gratitude to M.
