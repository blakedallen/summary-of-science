These compact remnants,\nexpected to number around 20000, may be accreting cold dense gas present there, and\ngive rise to potentially observable X-ray emission. Here we build a simple but detailed\ntime-dependent model of such emission. We find that at least several X-ray sources\nof this nature should be detectable with Chandra at any one time. Turning this issue\naround, we also ask a question of what current observational constraints might be\ntelling us about the total number of compact remnants. A cusp with \u223c 40 thousand\nblack holes over-predicts the number of discrete sources and the total X-ray luminosity\nof the inner parsec, and is hence ruled out. Future observations of the distribution and\norbits of the cold ionised gas in the inner parsec of Sgr A\u2217 will put tighter constraints\non the cusp of compact remnants.\nKey words: Galaxy: centre \u2013 accretion: accretion discs \u2013 galaxies: active\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nTheoretical calculations predict a cusp of around \u223c 20000\nstellar mass black holes in the central parsec of our\nGalaxy\n(Morris, 1993Miralda-Escud\u00e9 & Gould, 2000)\nand\na\nsimilar\nnumber\nof\nneutron\nstars\n(Freitag et al., 2006Hopman & Alexander, 2006).\nX-ray\nobservations reveal a highly significant overabundance\nof transients in the same region (Muno et al., 2005) as\ncompared with the region of \u223c several tens of parsecs from\nSgr A\u2217 , the Msmbh \u223c 4 \u00d7 106 M\u2299 super-massive black hole\n(Sch\u00f6del et al., 2002Ghez et al., 2003) in the Galactic Centre (GC). Nayakshin & Sunyaev (2006) proposed that these\ncompact remnants may be accreting gas at relatively high\nrates when they happen to travel through a dense ionised\ngas observed to exist in the GC (also see Morris, 1993).\nThey calculated a simple time-averaged model for X-ray\nemission from such a cusp, and concluded that the total\n>\n1035 erg s\u22121 ,\nemission of the cusp could be as high as \u223c\ni.e. very significant observationally.\nOn the other hand, a time-independent treatment does\nnot do justice to the complexity of the problem. Despite\nthe high total number of black holes, due to a small volume\nfilling fraction of cold gas in the GC, only a few of the black\nholes will be moving within the gas clouds and possess a\nsmall enough relative velocity to be visible to Chandra. Here\nwe extend the model of Nayakshin & Sunyaev (2006) in two\nways. Firstly, we allow time-dependency in the problem by\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: Sergei.Nayakshin at astro.le.ac.uk\n\nexplicitly following realistic Keplerian orbits of the compact\nobjects. Secondly, we model the formation and evolution\nof small scale accretion discs around the accretors, as such\ndiscs will surely form due to an excess angular momentum in\nthe accreting gas. Non-circular gas orbits are also considered\nwith a simplified approach.\nOur models show a large intrinsic time-dependence of\nthe accretion on the compact objects and the X-ray emission it produces. Despite that, and despite internal uncertainties of the model (exact gas orbits, circularisation radius parameter, radiative efficiency, etc.), we feel that certain rather robust conclusions can be drawn. In particular,\nwith the \u223c 20000 compact remnants expected in the central parsec, at least several X-ray sources with X-ray luminosity greater than 1033 erg s\u22121 should be present. Such\nsources, which can be called \"fake X-ray binaries\" for obvious reasons, can potentially contribute to the sources observed by Muno et al. (2005) in the central parsec. Conversely, it appears that a cusp significantly more populous,\ni.e., with 40000 compact remnants, would over-produce the\nX-ray emission as compared to the observations, and should\nthus be ruled out.\n\n2\n\nNUMERICAL APPROACH\n\nThe\nbasis\nof\nour\nsetup\nis\nexplained\nin\nNayakshin & Sunyaev (2006), and hence we shall only\nbriefly discuss the main points, sparing detail for the\nimprovements introduced here.\n\n\f2\n\nP. Deegan & S. Nayakshin\n\nWe assume that a stellar mass black hole travelling\nthrough a gas cloud or a disc with density \u03c1 is capturing gas in a small scale disc about it (see below) at the\nBondi & Hoyle (1944) accretion rate:\n\u1e40capt = 4\u03c0\u03c1\n\n(G Mbh )2\n,\n(\u2206v 2 + c2s )3/2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere cs and \u2206v are the gas sound speed and the relative\nvelocity between the black hole and the gas, respectively.\nThe above picture is complicated by the presence of the\nSMBH. The area of influence of the stellar mass black holes\nis limited by the Hill's radius, rH = R(Mbh /3Msmbh )1/3 ,\nwhere R is the distance between the stellar mass black hole\nand the SMBH. This imposes a limit on the capture rate,\n2\ngiven by the Hill accretion rate, M \u0307H = 4\u03c0rH\n\u03c1cs . Hence,\n\u1e40capt = min[\u1e40capt , \u1e40H ]\n\nTime-dependent disc accretion\n\nThe captured gas may have a net angular momentum resulting in the formation of a disk around the stellar mass black\nhole. The disc size is of order of the circularisation radius for\nthe gas flow, rc , which is unknown a priori. The maximum\nvalue of rc is the capture radius, rcapt , which is\n\nh\n\nrcapt = min rH ,\n\nGMbh\n\u2206v 2 + c2s\n\ni\n\n.\n\n(3)\n\nWe thus parametrise the circularisation radius as\nrc = \u03b6rcapt ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b6 is a parameter less than unity. The viscous time\nscale in such a disk around the stellar mass black hole is\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\nrcapt 2\ntvisc =\n,\n(5)\n\u03b1\u03a9d\nh\n\np\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the viscosity parameter, \u03a9d = GMbh /rc3 is the\nangular velocity of the disk and h is the height scale of the\ndisk. Numerically,\n1/2\n\n\u22121\ntvisc = 1.5 \u00d7 103 year \u03b1\u22121\n0.01 \u03bcd rc,12 Td,3 ,\n\n(6)\n3\n\nwhere Td,3 is the disk temperature in units of 10 K,\nthe viscosity parameter is \u03b1 = 0.01\u03b10.01 , \u03bcd is the mean\nmolecular mass in units of Hydrogen mass and rc,12 is the\ncircularisation radius in 1012 cm. This is to be compared\nwith period (the orbital time) about the SMBH:\nP =\n\nMd \u2212tvisc /12t\ne\ntvisc\n\n(9)\n\n(see \u00a75.2 in Frank et al. (2002)). Finally, the luminosity\nof the accretion flow is modelled in the same way as\nin Nayakshin & Sunyaev (2006). Namely, we write LX =\n\u01eb\u1e40acc c2 , where \u01eb is given by\n\u01eb = 0.01\n\n\u1e40acc\n,\n\u1e400 + \u1e40acc\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u1e400 = 0.01 is the critical accretion rate where the\nswitch from the radiatively efficient to radiatively inefficient\nregime occurs (Esin et al., 1997). Here we also assumed that\nX-ray emission visible in the Chandra band constitutes 10%\nof the bolometric efficiency, which would be a lower limit for\ntypical spectra of X-ray binaries in their hard state.\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u1e40capt on the right hand side of the equation is defined\nin eq.1.\n2.1\n\n\u1e40acc =\n\n2\u03c0\n\u22121/2\n3/2\n.\n= 2900 year R0.1 M6\n\u03a9K\n\n(7)\n\nHere, \u03a9K is the Keplerian angular frequency\npfor the black\nhole orbiting the super-massive one: \u03a9K = GMsmbh /R3 .\nThe respective Keplerian velocity is vK = R\u03a9K .\nThus, the gas captured in the small scale disk accretes\non the black hole after a delay of a fraction of to a few (black\nhole around the SMBH) orbital times. The evolution of the\ndisk mass is given by the rate at which the mass is added,\n\u1e40capt , minus the mass accreted onto the black hole, \u1e40acc :\ndMd\n= \u1e40capt \u2212 \u1e40acc .\ndt\nThe black hole accretion rate is calculated as\n\n(8)\n\n2.2\n\nOrbital evolution of accretors\n\nWe model the velocity and space distribution of stellar mass\nblack holes as a cusp that follows the Bahcall & Wolf (1976)\ndistribution for heavier species in a mass-segregated cusp.\nThis distribution results in the black hole number density\nand velocity distribution obeying power laws of the form\nR\u22127/4 and f0 respectively, where,\nf0 \u221d R\n\n\u22121/4\n\n\u0012\n\nv2\n1\u2212 2\nvesc\n\n\u0013\u22121/4\n\n.\n\n(11)\n\nBoth space and velocity distributions are isotropic. The\nmost recent Monte-Carlo simulations Freitag et al. (2006)\nbroadly support these classical results. A recent FokkerPlanck study (Hopman & Alexander, 2006) predicts a somewhat steeper power-law density dependence for the black\nhole cusp, \u03c1BH \u221d R\u22122 , but we leave this level of detail for\nfuture investigations.\nOur black hole cusp is sharply cut at R = 0.7 pc (see\nMiralda-Escud\u00e9 & Gould, 2000). Clearly, the artificial cut\nof the black hole distribution at the outer cusp radius is a\ncrude approximation to the more complicated broken powerlaw structure of the cusp found by Freitag et al. (2006). It is\nalso not entirely self-consistent as black holes do follow their\norbits hence changing their radial position. To determine the\nsignificance of this we examined the structure of our model\ncusp in 104 years after it was set up. The density profile\ndid in fact change. Some of black holes on eccentric orbits\nwith large semi-major axes were found at radii much larger\nthan the outer cusp radius assumed, as expected. However,\nthe maximum change in the black hole density profile was\nno more than 30%. Furthermore, the black holes on very\neccentric orbits will be those that accrete gas at a low rate\nunless gas in the inner parsec moves on similar eccentric\norbits. Therefore emission from these black holes might be\nneglected in any event.\nGenerating a series of orbits consistent with this spacevelocity distribution, we randomly set the initial phases of\nthe black holes along their orbits, and then we follow their\nspatial motion. We also track the instantaneous gas capture\nrate for each black hole. When one of these orbits intersects\nthe disc of the Minispiral, the black hole in question starts\ncapturing gas and builds up a disc around it as described in\n\u00a72.1.\n\n\fConstraining the number of compact remnants near Sgr A\u2217\n\n3\n\nTable 1.

(2004) suggests that the Minispiral is a\ndynamical feature in a state of almost a free fall onto\nSgr A\u2217 . We feel that the Minispiral's orbit is not likely\nto be so radial, as one would then expect Sgr A\u2217 itself\nto be accreting from the Minispiral. This would result\nin accretion rates far above that from the stellar winds\n(Cuadra et al., 2006), and would contradict the X-ray observations (e.g., Baganoff et al., 2003). More realistically the\ngas in the Minispiral follows an eccentric orbit which does\nnot enter the inner arcsecond (\u223c 0.03 parsec) of the GC.\nIn our simple model, the Minispiral is modelled as half\nof a disc in a local Keplerian circular rotation around Sgr A\u2217\nwith the total gas mass of Mdisc = 50M\u2299 , in accord with\nestimates in Paumard et al. (2004). It extends from a radius of 0.1 pc from the SMBH to a radius of 0.5 pc. The\ndisc heightscale, H, is assumed to have a fixed ratio to\nthe radius, R: H/R = 0.1. The gas density is given by\n\u03c1(R) = Mdisc /(\u03c0R2 H).\nThe dynamical age of the Minispiral is a few thousand\nyears. Therefore, we ran our calculations for 3000 years with\nthese assumptions, and then we \"remove\" the Minispiral instantaneously. This is done as a rough model of time evolution of the system in the case the gas apocenter is larger\nthan 0.5 parsec, so that the Minispiral would leave the inner\n0.5 parsec after a dynamical time. In \u00a73.4 we vary some of\nthe above assumptions about the structure of the Minispiral\nto estimate sensitivity of our results to these assumptions. In\na future work a more complicated, but unavoidably modeldependent dynamic of the Minispiral should be included.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nRESULTS\nEmission from individual black holes\n\nTo motivate the study of X-ray emission from black hole\ncusps in this paper, we first examine the emission from individual black holes. For simplicity of discussion in this section only, the \"half-disk\" described in \u00a72.3 is replaced with\na full disk, with other parameters unchanged, the only exception being the mass of the Minispiral, which was doubled. The black holes follow Keplerian orbits (\u00a72.2) that are\ncharacterised by the values of the semi-major axis and the\neccentricity (see Table 1). The inclination of the orbit to\n\nFigure 1. X-ray light curves of the four individual black holes\ndescribed in \u00a73.1; the solid, dotted, dashed and dotted-dashed\nlines correspond to T1, T2, T3, and T4 respectively.\n\nthe midplane of the disc, i, is also essential in determining\nthe accretion history of the black hole in question. The orbital parameters of the test cases are summarised in Table\n1. Figure 1 shows the resulting light curves for the four tests\nexplored. The circularisation parameter is fixed at \u03b6 = 0.1\nfor all of the tests.\nWe start by looking at the most luminous case, T1 in\nTable 1, shown with the solid curve in Figure 1. Low inclination and eccentricity of the orbit ensure that the black\nhole spends all of its time inside the disc. In addition, the\nrelative velocity between the black hole and the gas is small\nas the orbit of the former is close to circular. The capture\nrate is then large, resulting in a relatively high gas capture\nrate and X-ray luminosity. The few kinks in the lightcurve\nare caused by periodic variations in the relative velocity due\nto the eccentricity of the orbit. One could analyse these in\nterms of the epicyclic motion approximation for this nearly\ncircular orbit.\nThe black hole in test T2 is on a slightly more eccentric\nand more inclined orbit. The relative black hole-gas velocity\nis larger than in test T1, and hence the gas capture rate (see\neq. 1) is reduced. The black hole spends a significant amount\nof time inside the disc, but there are periods of time when it\nexits the disc through its one or the other face. Half of the\ndips in the lightcurve correspond to time spent outside the\ndisc, and the other to the time when the relative velocity\n\u2206v reaches the highest value along the trajectory. Due to a\nrelatively large size of the accretion disc (the \"small scale\"\none discussed in \u00a72.1) that builds up around the black hole,\nthe viscous time is comparable to the duration of time spent\noutside of the disc, and hence the dips are relatively minor.\nThe X-ray light curve of the source reaches a quasi-steady\nstate with the luminosity Lx \u223c few\u00d71034 erg s\u22121 after \u223c 104\nyears.\nIn test T3 we consider a black hole on a more eccentric\n\n\f4\n\nP. Deegan & S. Nayakshin\n\norbit, with eccentricity e = 0.6, and a larger semi-major axis.\nThe high eccentricity of the orbit results in a high relative\nvelocity which limits the gas capture rate. For most of the\norbit, LX < 1033 erg s\u22121 . The luminosity of the black hole\nincreases dramatically at t \u2248 8000 years, when the black hole\nis at periapsis, where the relative velocity is low enough and\nthe density of the gas is high enough for the luminosity to\napproach that of case T2.\nFinally test T4 is close to the worst case scenario as far\nas the gas capture rate is concerned. A high inclination and\neccentricity orbit imply that the black hole spends little time\ninside the disc. Accumulation of gas in the small scale accretion disc happens in a burst-like manner when the black\nhole is inside the disc. Also note that since the relative velocity is high, gas capture radius (equation 3) is smaller than\nit is in tests T1 and T2, and hence the disc viscous time\n(equation 6) is shorter, resulting in shorter decay times for\nthe \"bursts\" in the lightcurve. The X-ray luminosity is never\nlarger than few \u00d71032 erg s\u22121 .\nThese simple tests indicate that we may expect the\nblack holes to produce a detectable X-ray emission in one of\nthe two ways: (i) a few black holes may be on orbits essentially co-moving with the gas, producing a few bright point\nsources; (ii) the dim majority of high inclination and/or\nhigh eccentricity orbits may not produce individually bright\nsources but may be collectively bright, producing an unresolvable \"diffuse\" X-ray emission.\n3.2\n\nFigure 2. X-ray light curves (top panels) and number of individual sources (bottom panels) where Lx < 1033 erg s\u22121 , when the\ntotal number of black holes in the inner parsec is 5000. The left\nand right panels correspond to \u03b6 = 0.1 and \u03b6 = 0.001 respectively.\n\nRepresentative cases\n\nHaving considered the individual accretors case in the previous section we move on to the problem of the total black\nhole cusp emission with the Minispiral model as described\nin \u00a72.3. The upper panels in Figure 2 display the total Xray luminosity of a cluster of 5000 black holes as a function\nof time for two values of the circularisation radius parameter, \u03b6, 0.1 and 0.001, left and right, respectively. The lower\npanels show the number of X-ray sources with luminosity\nhigher than 1033 erg s\u22121 for the tests shown in the panels\njust above the respective lower panels. Such sources could\nbe observed by Chandra. Several conclusions can be made.\nWith a larger value of \u03b6 = 0.1, the accretion discs around\nblack holes are larger, and thus viscous times are long. As\na result, the X-ray emission varies smoothly with time, first\nincreasing as the discs are built up, and then decreasing on\n\u223c a thousand years time scale. Thus the sources are rather\nsteady in time, and are also dim.\nFor the smaller value of \u03b6 = 10\u22123 , viscous times in small\nscale discs are much shorter. Therefore, the X-ray emission\nfrom the sources vary on much shorter time scales, i.e., of\nfew years to tens of years. The sources are also brighter\nas the peak accretion rates are higher \u2013 each individual\nsource shines much brighter for a shorter time, of course,\nas compared with the larger \u03b6 case. Both the upper and the\nlower panels provide us with largely independent predictions\nwhich may be compared to X-ray observations.\nFigure 3 shows the same experiments as Figure 2 but\nfor 20000 black holes. Comparison between the two different\nvalues of \u03b6 shows similar trends as before. It is interesting\nto compare the Figures 2 and 3. While the results depend\nsignificantly on the a priori unknown value of \u03b6, both low and\nhigh \u03b6 tests show same tendency of a significant luminosity\n\nFigure 3. X-ray light curves and number of individual sources\nwhere Lx < 1033 erg s\u22121 , when the total number of black holes\nin the inner parsec is 20000. The left and right panels correspond\nto \u03b6 = 0.1 and \u03b6 = 0.001 respectively.\n\nincrease with increase in the number of black holes. In fact,\nthe luminosity increased by a larger factor than the black\nhole number did. The number of sources above the chosen\nluminosity threshold also increased. This suggests that by\nperforming tests across all reasonable parameter space for \u03b6\nwe should be able to find the maximum allowed number of\nstellar mass black holes in the cusp.\n\n\fConstraining the number of compact remnants near Sgr A\u2217\n3.3\n\nSearch in the N , \u03b6 parameter space\n\n3.4\n\nFollowing this idea, we ran a number of models for a range\nof values of \u03b6 and for the total black hole numbers of N =\n5, 10, 20 and 40 thousand. During the time period modelled,\nthe results vary considerably in each test. For example, it\nis possible for just one single source to dominate the Xray luminosity output of the cluster. In order to reduce and\nestimate statistical noise of the results, for each of the values\nof \u03b6 and the total black hole number considered here, the\ntests were repeated three times, each time generating a new\nrandom black hole orbit distribution. We then calculate the\nmean value for the observables for the three runs, and we\nalso find deviations from the mean values. The averaging\nis done between time 2000 < t < 3000 years as to look\nat a state that may be similar to the present state of the\nMinispiral, given its estimated dynamical time.\nA summary of the results is presented in Table 2. We\nchose to define several quantities. The most important are\nthe average total X-ray luminosity of the black hole cluster\nand the number of black holes brighter than 1033 erg s\u22121 ,\nNX , as such sources would have been resolved by Chandra into separate point sources. Time-dependent variants of\nthese quantities were plotted in Figures 2 and 3.\nIn addition to these, we defined the probabilities that\nthe total luminosity of the cusp exceeds 1035 and 1036 erg\ns\u22121 as the fraction of time these conditions are satisfied:\n\nP (LX > 1035 ) =\n\nZ\n\n1\ntf \u2212 ti\n\ndt ,\n\n(12)\n\nLX >1035\n\nand obviously similarly for 1036 erg s\u22121 , ti and tf are 2000\nand 3000 years respectively.\nThe probability of the number of individual sources\nbrighter than LX > 1033 being larger than 3, 10 and 20\nat a given time is defined in a similar way, e.g.,\n\nP (NX > 10) =\n\n1\ntf \u2212 ti\n\nZ\n\ndt.\n\n(13)\n\nNX >10\n\nThese values can be compared to the number of discreet\nX-ray sources in the inner parsec as detected by Chandra.\nObservations of the inner parsec by Chandra have\nplaced upper limits on the total luminosity of sources of\napproximately 1035 erg s\u22121 (Baganoff et al., 2003) and the\nnumber of individual X-ray sources with a luminosity greater\nthan 1033 erg s\u22121 of a dozen or so (F. Baganoff, private communication). With these constraints in mind we can immediately rule out the possibility that the cusp contains 40000\nblack holes. For any reasonable value of \u03b6, the total luminosity and the number of individual sources with LX > 1033 erg\ns\u22121 are too large compared to observations. A cusp containing 20000 black holes is not very likely but cannot be ruled\nout completely at this time. In particular, only the larger \u03b6\ncase is acceptable for N = 20000. Even though the average\ntotal cusp luminosity is \u223c 1036 erg s\u22121 for this test, i.e., too\nlarge, the probability P (LX > 1035 ) is only \u223c 0.66. Cusps\nwith N = 5000 or 10000 black holes is well within the limits\nimposed by observations.\n\n5\n\nSensitivity of results to the properties of the\nMinispiral\n\nWe used a rather simple model for the Minispiral here (\u00a72.3),\npartially because it is not yet clear what a better model for\nthis gas would be. At the moment, we do not know the origin of this gaseous feature and the precise three-dimensional\ndistribution of gas and velocity field (Paumard et al., 2004).\nTo test sensitivity of our conclusions to the properties\nof the Minispiral, we varied several of the assumptions made\nin \u00a72.3. Table 3 summarises these tests. In particular, in one\nof the series of tests we let the Minispiral to be 3 times\nmore massive, i.e., to contain 150 M\u2299 of gas, with all other\nassumptions unchanged. In this case the luminosity of the\ncusp increases significantly at a given number of black holes,\nand even the N = 104 case is too luminous for the smaller\nvalues of the circularisation parameter \u03b6. Hence the upper\nlimit on the number of black holes is then around 104 .\nAnother likely complication is that the gas may be on\na parabolic or an eccentric trajectory rather than a circular one, as assumed in this paper until now. For such orbits, gas velocity can be both larger and smaller than the\nlocal Keplerian value, depending on where exactly on the\norbit the gas is. Observationally, the Minispiral seems to be\ncloser to the pericenter of its orbit rather than an apocenter (Paumard et al., 2004). To test the significance of nonKeplerian orbits, we let the gas velocity to be 1.2 and 1.4\ntimes the local Keplerian value in the two series of tests\npresented in Table 3. Clearly this model is not geometrically self-consistent as the half-disc we use for the Minispiral should then deform in a complicated way, but we expect\nto gain some guidance to the direction of change in the results nonetheless. The larger gas velocity should result in\na decrease in the number of black holes travelling at a low\nrelative speed through the Minispiral, which should reduce\nthe average gas capture rate (equation 1).\nTable 3 shows that increasing the gas velocity to 1.2 of\nthe local Keplerian value results in a marked drop in average\nluminosity of black holes, to the point that a cusp containing\n40000 black holes cannot be ruled out for the larger value of\nthe circularisation parameter, \u03b6 = 0.1. On the other hand,\nrealistically, we would expect the sources to have a distribution in values of \u03b6, and we would thus expect a fair number\nof sources to have zeta \u223c 0.01 or less, which would then be\nruled out.\nMoving on to the gas velocity = 1.4vK , we note a further drop in the luminosity of the cusp and the number of\nsources detectable by Chandra (Table 3). Even the N =\n40000 is allowed. We however feel that this model strongly\nover-simplifies the situation in the Galactic Centre. The\nMinispiral should be a feature bound to Sgr A\u2217 (or else the\nfact that it is crossing the innermost region of the parsec now\nwould be a coincidence), and hence it is rather implausible\nthat the gas\n\u221a is on a radial trajectory for which one would\nhave v = 2vK \u223c 1.4vK . We believe the case of v = 1.2vK\nis the one that represents the reality better.\nFinally, the last entries in Table 3 are the tests with\nthe Minispiral mass of M = 150 M\u2299 and v = 1.2vK . A\ncusp of 40000 black holes is clearly inconsistent with the\nobservations, whereas the N = 20000 is constrained but not\ncompletely ruled out.\n\n\f6\n\nP. Deegan & S. Nayakshin\n\n3.5\n\nA neutron star cusp\n\nThe mechanism that produces an overabundance of black\nholes in the Galactic Centre also applies to neutron stars, as\nthey are also heavier than an average star. Simulations by\nFreitag et al. (2006) predict that a cusp of neutron stars will\nhave a number density profile quite similar to that of stellar mass black holes. As far as our investigation goes, these\nneutron stars would be accreting gas in a similar manner to\nthe black holes, with modifications only due to the smaller\nmass (we set Mns = 1.4 M\u2299 ) and the existence of a surface.\nWe approximate the emission of an accreting neutron\nstar as a black body one with temperature Tns from the\n2\nsurface area 4\u03c0Rns\n, where Rns = 10 km is the radius of the\nneutron star. Most of the radiation flux will be emitted at\nwavelengths corresponding to photon energy E = 3kTns :\n1/4\n\nE \u2248 0.8 L34\n\nKeV ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere L34 is the X-ray Luminosity in units of 1034 erg s\u22121 .\nDue to the quite large absorbing column density to the GC,\nNH \u223c 1023 cm\u22122 (Baganoff et al., 2003), soft X-ray emission\nbelow \u223c 1 keV is practically unobservable. We hence set the\nminimum observable total X-ray luminosity of a neutron star\nto be 1034 erg s\u22121 , rather than 1033 erg s\u22121 for the black\nhole case.\nWe assume that the radiative efficiency of an accreting\nneutron star with negligible magnetic fields is constant at\n\u01eb \u223c 0.1, in which case the luminosity of an accreting neutron\nstar is simply\nLX = 0.1\u1e40acc c2 .\n\n(15)\n\nNote that if magnetic fields are non-negligible, then the\n\"propeller effect\" may reduce the X-ray luminosity of neutron stars (Menou et al., 1999), but we leave these complications for a future more extended study.\nWith these modifications, we can use the machinery\ndeveloped in \u00a72 to calculate the X-ray emission from the\ncusp containing neutron stars. The results are presented in\na way identical to the black hole cusp in Table 4. As with\nthe black hole cusp case, the N = 40000 case is strongly\nruled out on account of too large a number of detectable\npoint sources, NX , and the total X-ray luminosity of the\ncusp. The N = 20000 cusp also appears to be a bit too\nhigh in terms of both the total luminosity and the number\nof sources. The data may still tolerable this, especially if\none takes into account the possibility of the propeller effect\n(Menou et al., 1999) neglected here.\n\nelaborated study, where a time-dependent disc accretion\nonto the compact sources was considered. Also, we took\ninto account the fact that at low accretion rates, the\nradiative efficiency of black holes appears to be drastically\nreduced (e.g., Esin et al., 1997), and we used a Monte-Carlo\nlike approach to randomly initialise the cusp of compact\nremnants.\nThe main effort in our paper was to set the upper limit\non the number of compact remnants. Whereas the models\nhave internal uncertainties, such as the value of circularisation parameter \u03b6, and observational uncertainties (the Mass\nand precise orbit of the Minispiral), a cusp of black holes or\n>\nneutron stars with N \u223c\n40, 000 seems to be strongly ruled\nout. A cusp with N \u223c 20, 000 black holes, as theoretically\npredicted (Freitag et al., 2006Hopman & Alexander, 2006),\nis broadly consistent with the data. Future efforts should\nimprove these upper limits.\nOn the basis of our calculations, we think it is quite\nrealistic that some of the X-ray sources visible in the central\nparsec (e.g., Baganoff et al., 2003Muno et al., 2005) may be\nisolated black holes and neutron stars accreting gas from the\nMinispiral. Such sources should be preferentially found close\nto the Minispiral if viscous time is short (\u03b6 is small). In addition, binary systems containing a black hole and a normal\nlow mass star can also accrete gas in roughly the same way\nas we calculated here. In the case of low values of circularisation parameter, \u03b6, the size of the disc around the primary\n(the black hole) can be smaller than the size of the binary\nitself. Thus, these systems may appear as \"fake X-ray binaries\", where the gas supply comes from outside rather than\nfrom the low mass secondary. Observational signatures of\nsuch systems might be warped and out of binary plane accretion discs, \"too short\" or \"too weak\" accretion outbursts\nfor the size of the binary.\nWe acknowledge stimulating discussions with Mark Freitag, Fred Baganoff and Rashid Sunyaev.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nBaganoff F.
