The mass distribution of the rich cluster of galaxies Cl0024+1654 has frequently been used to constrain\nthe nature of dark matter yet a model consistent with all the observational data has been difficult to construct.\nIn this paper we analyse the three-dimensional structure of this cluster using new spectroscopic information on\n\u223c 300 galaxies within a projected radius of 3 h\u22121 Mpc. These data reveal an unusual foreground component of\ngalaxies separated from the main cluster by 3000 km s\u22121 . We use numerical simulations to show that a high\nspeed collision along the line of sight between Cl0024+1654 and a second cluster of slightly smaller mass can\nreproduce the observed peculiar redshift distribution. Such a collision would dramatically alter the internal mass\ndistribution of the bound remnants, creating constant density cores from initially cuspy dark matter profiles and\nscattering galaxies to large projected radii, consistent with the observed distribution of galaxies in Cl0024+1654.\nThe proposed scenario can reconcile the inferred mass profile from gravitational lensing with predictions from\nhierarchical structure formation models, while at the same time resolving the mass discrepancy that results from\na comparison between lensing, velocity dispersion and X-ray studies.\nKey words. galaxies: clusters: Cl0024+1654 \u2013 cosmology: observations \u2013 cosmology: large-scale structure of the\nUniverse\n\n1. Introduction\nThe nature of the ubiquitous dark matter remains one of\nthe major mysteries in cosmology. The traditional view is\nthat the dark matter is cold, i. e. non-relativistic at the\ndecoupling epoch, and only subject to gravitational and\nweak interactions. Structure formation with this type of\ndark matter has been investigated extensively through numerical simulations over the past 25 years. High-resolution\nsimulations of individual cold dark matter halos have\nshown that the mass distribution in CDM halos over a\nwide range of total masses, from dwarf galaxy to cluster scales, should follow a universal profile (Navarro et al.\n1997, NFW); in particular, the mass distribution is found\nto have a central cusp with logarithmic slope of \u22121.5\n(Moore et al. 1998; Ghigna et al. 2000). Recent observational results, however, have challenged this simple picture.\nThe rich cluster of galaxies Cl0024+1654 at z = 0.395\nfeatures a spectacular quintuple gravitational arc system\nSend offprint requests\noczoske@ast.obs-mip.fr\n\nto:\n\nOliver\n\nCzoske,\n\ne-mail:\n\nof radius 106 h\u22121 kpc that has been used to reconstruct\nthe projected central mass distribution (Kassiola et al.\n1992; Smail et al. 1996; Tyson et al. 1998; Broadhurst\net al. 2000). Constructing a mass model for this cluster\nthat is consistent with all the observations has proved\nvery difficult, however. The total projected mass enclosed\nwithin the arc radius is fairly well constrained and yields a\nvalue of about 1.6 \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 . To reproduce this mass\nwith an NFW type profile would require a cluster with\ncharacteristic velocity dispersion larger than 2000 km s\u22121\n(Broadhurst et al. 2000; Shapiro & Iliev 2000). This is\nmuch higher than observed in this or indeed in any other\ncluster of galaxies. The mass reconstruction by Tyson\net al. (1998), based on the detailed structure of the gravitationally lensed background spiral galaxy, shows a flat\ncore in the projected central mass distribution with a core\nradius of 35 h\u22121 kpc. This apparent contradiction to the\npredictions of standard CDM simulations has prompted a\nnumber of authors to investigate alternatives to the classic CDM scenario, e. g. warm dark matter, self-interacting\ndark matter, etc. (Spergel & Steinhardt 2000; Hogan &\nDalcanton 2000; Moore et al. 2000).\n\n\f2\n\nO. Czoske et al.: Spectroscopic survey of Cl0024+1654: II.\n\nAs more detailed observations of individual clusters of\ngalaxies are compiled, combinations of X-ray imaging and\nspectroscopy, velocity dispersion measurements and lensing mass maps frequently reveal that clusters that were\nthought to be simple relaxed objects are actually more\ncomplex systems, frequently undergoing mergers or generally showing signs of substructure and deviations from\ndynamical equilibrium. Evidence for recent mergers or accretion is currently accumulating through Chandra observations in the form of merger shocks (e. g. Markevitch\n& Vikhlinin 2001; Markevitch et al. 2001) or cold fronts\n(Markevitch et al. 2000; Vikhlinin et al. 2001; Mazzotta\net al. 2001). Mergers and substructure have also been invoked to explain the discrepancy between mass estimates\nfrom different methods that is observed in many clusters\n(Miralda-Escud\u00e9 & Babul 1995; Wu et al. 1998).\nCl0024+1654 is an example of a cluster where the high\nmass inferred from the strong lensing mass reconstructions is at variance with the fairly low X-ray luminosity\nand temperature, that indicate a total mass for the cluster which is a factor 2 to 3 smaller than the lensing mass\n(Soucail et al. 2000). Both the galaxy distribution on the\nsky and the X-ray morphology are regular and by themselves compatible with a relaxed massive cluster, a notion\nwhich was further supported by the high galaxy velocity\ndispersion of \u2248 1200 km s\u22121 found in the redshift surveys\nof Dressler & Gunn (1992) and Dressler et al. (1999, hereafter D99).\nIn Czoske et al. (2001, Paper I) we presented a new\ncatalogue of 650 measured redshifts (including those from\nD99) in a wide field around Cl0024+1654. 300 galaxies in\nthe catalogue have redshifts in the range 0.37 < z < 0.42,\ni. e. are cluster members or lie in the immediate neighbourhood of the cluster, and the redshift distribution of\nthese galaxies was found in Paper I to be distinctly bimodal. In the present paper we analyse the distribution\nof the galaxies in redshift/real space and present a merger\nscenario which is able to reconcile all the observations.\nSection 2 recalls the data used and describes the distribution of the redshifts globally and as a function of position\nwithin the survey field, as well as the distribution of spectral types based on equivalent widths of important lines.\nIn Section 3, we develop the merger scenario and use numerical simulations to show that it is possible to explain\nthe peculiar three-dimensional distribution of the galaxies\nin Cl0024+1654. In Section 4 we show how the observed\nstructure is able to explain and resolve the discrepancy\nof mass estimates of Cl0024+1654 derived from different\nobservations. Finally, in Section 5 we summarize and conclude.\nThroughout this paper we use a Hubble constant H0 =\n100 h\u22121 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 and assume an Einstein-de Sitter\nUniverse with \u03a9M = 1 and \u03a9\u039b = 0. At the redshift of\nCl0024+1654, z = 0.395, 1\u2032\u2032 corresponds to 3.195 h\u22121 kpc.\n\n2. The cluster environment\n\nFig. 1. Redshift histogram for 300 objects in the neighbourhood of Cl0024+1654 (0.37 < z < 0.42). The attribution of galaxies to components A (dark grey) and B (light\ngrey) was done by inspection of Fig. 2. Whereas the lower\nand upper redshift limits of components B and A respectively are fairly secure, the exact demarcation between\nthe two components is arbitrary to some extent and was\nchosen at \u2206v = \u22121500 km s\u22121 with respect to the central\nredshift of component A, Eq. (2).\n\n2.1. The data\nIn Paper I we presented a new catalogue of photometric\nand spectroscopic data for 679 objects in a wide field of\n21 \u00d7 25 arcmin2 around Cl0024+1654. At the redshift of\nthe cluster, z = 0.395, this corresponds to 4 \u00d7 4.8 h\u22122 Mpc2\n(the true survey field is delimited by an irregular polygon\ninscribed in this rectangle and covers 16.8 h\u22122 Mpc2 , see\nFig. 4, or Fig. 7 in Paper I). The catalogue lists equatorial\nposition, redshift, V magnitude, V \u2212 I colour, equivalent\nwidths for [O ii] \u03bb3727, [O iii] \u03bb5007, H\u03b1 (where within the\nwavelength range), H\u03b2 and H\u03b4, as well as the strength of\nthe 4000\u00c5 break. Here we are only concerned with the\n650 objects having measured redshifts, of which 581 were\nobserved by us at CFHT and WHT, with the remaining\n69 taken from Dressler et al. (1999). See Paper I for more\ntechnical details on the data used in this paper.\n\n2.2. Redshift distribution\nFig. 1 shows a histogram of the 300 redshifts that lie in\nthe range 0.37 < z < 0.42. The redshift distribution of the\ncluster galaxies is clearly bimodal, showing two peaks at\nz = 0.381 and z = 0.395 respectively; these peaks contain\n283 galaxies.\nThe larger peak at z = 0.395 (0.387 < z < 0.402, hereafter referred to as component A) contains 237 galaxies,\nis fairly regular and resembles a Gaussian distribution as\nexpected for a relaxed, virialized cluster of galaxies. The\n\n\fO. Czoske et al.: Spectroscopic survey of Cl0024+1654: II.\n\nsmaller foreground peak at z = 0.381 (0.374 < z < 0.387,\ncomponent B), by contrast, seems too wide for the small\nnumber of 46 redshifts contained in it. This impression\nis confirmed by Fig. 2, which plots the redshift for each\ngalaxy versus its projected distance from the centre of\nCl0024+16541. The distribution of the galaxies in the\nmain peak is symmetrical with respect to the central\nredshift line, whereas the distribution of the foreground\ngalaxies is roughly constant at a rest frame velocity of\n\u223c \u22123000 km s\u22121 at radii larger than 3\u2032 (600 h\u22121 kpc), but\nturns off towards smaller relative velocities to merge with\nthe main distribution at smaller projected distances.\nThe 17 galaxies in the peak at z = 0.407 are more\nwidely dispersed across the survey field and although we\ncannot rule out a connection with Cl0024+1654, it seems\nmore likely, in the light of the scenario developed in Sect.\n3, that they are part of the surrounding field galaxy population.\nIt is remarkable that we can trace the main cluster\nas well as the foreground structure out to the edge of\nthe survey field (there remains only one object in the\ncatalogue outside the range depicted in Fig. 2, a background galaxy). The virial radius for Cl0024+1654 should\nbe around 1 h\u22121 Mpc (Girardi & Mezzetti 2001), which\nmeans that we detect a coherent structure out to three\ntimes the virial radius.\n\nRedshift distribution inside 200\u2032\u2032\nFrom Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 (upper panel) it is obvious that\nthe central region of Cl0024+1654 is highly perturbed and\nit is impossible to separate components A and B within\n\u223c 200\u2032\u2032 (640 h\u22121 Mpc) from the projected cluster centre.\nHowever, the redshift distribution for the central galaxies\nis strongly skewed towards negative velocities: except for\ntwo galaxies that are fairly isolated in redshift space, the\nredshift distribution at positive velocities is effectively cut\noff at \u223c 1500 km s\u22121 , whereas the distribution at negative\nvelocities extends to beyond \u223c \u22122500 km s\u22121 , branching\noff into component B at \u223c 500 h\u22121 kpc from the projected\ncluster centre. Quantitatively the skewness of the distribution of 161 galaxies within 200\u2032\u2032 (0.37 < z < 0.42) is 0.54,\nwhere we use the definition given by Press et al. (1992):\nSkew(x1 . . . xN ) =\n\n\u00153\nN \u0014\n1 X xj \u2212 x\nN j=1\n\u03c3\n\n.\n\n(1)\n\nThe probability that a sample of size N = 161 drawn from\na normal distribution shows a skewness larger than that\nmeasured in Cl0024+1654 is about 0.3%. The ShapiroWilk normality test (Shapiro & Wilk 1965) rejects the hypothesis that these data points are drawn from a Gaussian\nparent population at \u226b 99% confidence. The skew in the\n1\n\nThe coordinates in the catalogue are given relative to\n\u03b12000 = 00h 26m 35.s 70, \u03b42000 = 17\u25e6 09\u2032 43.\u2032\u2032 06. Originally, this\nwas the position of galaxy 373, but a more accurate astrometric analysis shifted the reference point by 0.\u2032\u2032 79 to the south-east\nof this galaxy.\n\n3\n\ncentral redshift distribution is already apparent in the histogram given by Dressler et al. (1999) (see also Section 4).\n\nRedshift distribution outside 200\u2032\u2032\nIn the distribution of the galaxies outside 200\u2032\u2032 (Fig. 2\nand Fig. 3, bottom panel) the two modes are clearly separated. The mean redshift of the 71 galaxies belonging to\ncomponent A at projected distances 200\u2032\u2032 < R < 500\u2032\u2032 is\nzA = 0.3946 \u00b1 0.0007 .\n\n(2)\n\nIn Fig. 5 we show the two velocity dispersion profiles for\ngalaxies in component A with either positive or negative\nvelocities with respect to the mean redshift zA , calculated in a sliding bin containing 30 galaxies. Outside 3\u2032\n(600 h\u22121 kpc) both profiles are flat at the same level of\n\u03c3 \u2248 600 km s\u22121 . The profile for galaxies with negative velocities (i. e. those moving towards us, Fig. 5) rises all\nthe way to about 45\u2032\u2032 (140 h\u22121 kpc), reaching a velocity\ndispersion of nearly 900 km s\u22121 in the innermost bin. The\ndispersion profile of the galaxies with positive velocities,\nby contrast, drops back to a value of about 600 km s\u22121 after having reached a maximum value of about 800 km s\u22121\nat 2\u2032 from the centre. Although the galaxy velocities used\nin Fig. 5 have been restricted to |v| < 1500 km s\u22121 , the\ndifferent behaviour of the profiles for galaxies with positive and negative velocities respectively reflects the skew\nin the central redshift distribution and indicates the possible presence of a bulk motion component towards us in\nthe central galaxy distribution.\nThe exact value of the velocity dispersion of the 71\ngalaxies within the same distance range as used for Eq.\n(2) and velocity |v| < 1500 km s\u22121 relative to the central\nredshift zA is\n\u22121\n\u03c3A = 561+95\n\u221283 km s\n\n.\n\n(3)\n\nBoth zA and \u03c3A were computed using the biweight estimator (Beers et al. 1990), the errors (95% confidence level)\nwere estimated by bootstrap resampling.\nThe skewness of the distribution of these 71 redshifts\nis \u22120.12, which should be compared to the standard deviation of skewness for samples of this size drawn from a\nnormal distribution, 0.27. The Shapiro-Wilk test does not\nprovide evidence for deviations from a Gaussian distribution.\nThe spatial positions of the galaxies in the foreground\ncomponent B show no preference for any direction (Fig.\n4, middle panel). The formal velocity dispersion for component B in the same radial distance range as used in Eq.\n\u22121\n(3) is \u03c3B = 554+175\nbased on 15 redshifts. Given\n\u2212304 km s\nthat the number of galaxies in component A is almost five\ntimes as large as the number in component B it is hardly\nconceivable that both components should have the same\nvelocity dispersion \u2013 their mass-to-light ratios would be\nextremely different. Component B is certainly not a virialized group or cluster.\nFrom the distribution of the external galaxies alone\none might still suspect the presence of a loose aggregate\n\n\f4\n\nO. Czoske et al.: Spectroscopic survey of Cl0024+1654: II.\n\nof galaxies physically disconnected from Cl0024+1654, but\nwell-aligned with the line of sight; however, in the centre\nthere are no galaxies which would correspond to the z =\n0.38 peak visible in the external distribution (Fig. 3). If\nthe foreground component B were an independent loose\nsystem, it would show a deficiency of galaxies right in front\nof the centre of Cl0024+1654, which seems unlikely in the\nabsence of interaction between the systems. This leads us\nto suspect that the two components are in fact physically\nconnected and that the blue tail of the skewed central\ndistribution originates from the same physical system as\nthe foreground component B.\nFig. 2 shows the theoretical escape velocities for masses\nof 1, 3 and 5 \u00d7 1014 M\u2299 enclosed in a sphere of radius R.\nAlthough these lines are merely indicative due to the assumption of spherical symmetry and the unknown tangential velocity components, it is safe to say that the galaxies\nin component B outside, say, 600 h\u22121 kpc are not bound\nto the main cluster component, unlike the negative tail of\nthe skewed central galaxy distribution.\nThe galaxy density map of the main component A\n(Fig. 4) shows an extension of the galaxy distribution towards the northwest to a distance of 100\u2032\u2032 \u2212 150\u2032\u2032 . This extension is visible in images of Cl0024+1654 and we show\nhere that the galaxies contained in it lie at the redshift\nof the main cluster. Cl0024+1654 might therefore well be\ncomprised of three distinct subsystems: the main cluster,\ncomponent A; a foreground cluster or group, component\nB, which is interacting with the main cluster; and a third\ngroup or small cluster, which is falling onto the main cluster in the plane of the sky.\n\n2.3. Distribution of spectral types\nIn Tables 1 and 2 we classify the galaxies into spectral\ntypes, defined as in Balogh et al. (1999), using our measured values for the equivalent widths of [O ii], H \u03b4 and the\n4000\u00c5 break (see Paper I for details on how these values\nare defined and measured).\nWe consider four samples of galaxies according to redshift and projected spatial position; the sample boundaries for samples \"Centre\", \"A\" and \"B\" are marked by\nthe dotted lines in Fig. 2. The boundary between \"Centre\"\nand \"B\" is to some extent arbitrary; replacing the slanted\nline by a simple velocity cut at v = \u22121500 km s\u22121 does\nnot significantly change the numbers in Tables 1 and 2,\nhowever. \"Field\" includes all the galaxies in the sample\nwith redshifts 0 < z < 0.55 without the cluster galaxies,\n0.372 < z < 0.402 (the upper limit here is the same as for\nthe field sample in Balogh et al. (1999)).\nBoth the classifications by [O ii] vs. H \u03b4 and by H \u03b4\nvs. the 4000 \u00c5 break show an excess of blue starforming galaxies (star-forming/short starburst, SF/SSB,\nand emission-line galaxies, A+em) in component \"B\" as\ncompared to the cluster centre and possibly even over the\nfield. The distribution of spectral types in component \"A\"\nis between a typical cluster and field populations. This\n\nseems to provide support for the hypothesis that component B is a loose galaxy overdensity with spectral characteristics typical for field galaxies. Alternatively it is possible that the star-formation activity in the galaxies belonging to component B has recently been (re)activated and\nenhanced through interaction with a denser environment.\nWe include in Tables 1 and 2 corresponding numbers\nfrom Balogh et al. (1999). These numbers are not strictly\ncomparable, because the selection criteria used for the creation of our catalogue are quite different from those used\nby Balogh et al. (1999)2 ; this explains the discrepancies in\nparticular in the H \u03b4 vs. the 4000 \u00c5 break classification,\nalthough the general trends are the same. The agreement\nin the [O ii] vs. H \u03b4 classification on the other hand is very\ngood, even quantitatively.\n\n3. A high speed collision?\nIn general, a redshift difference between well-separated\nclusters at cosmological distances is a combination of a\ncosmological redshift difference due to the proper distance\nbetween the clusters along the line of sight and a Doppler\nshift due to the relative velocities of the two clusters. In\ngeneral, these two effects cannot be disentangled uniquely,\nand there might be several ways to reproduce a given redshift distribution. In the following we develop a scenario\nthat can reproduce the observed redshift distribution in\nCl0024+1654, in particular the skewed central distribution, the presence of two well-separated modes away from\nthe projected cluster centre extending to at least three\ntimes the virial radius.\nAssume that a group or cluster has undergone a near\nradial collision with Cl0024+1654 and we are now viewing\nthe merging system along the direction of the impact. In\nfact, several characteristic parameters of a collision scenario are fairly well constrained by the observed redshift\ndistribution. The relative velocity of the two subclusters\nis given by the redshift difference of components A and\nB and is thus of order 3000 km s\u22121 . Those parts of the\nsmaller cluster B that pass through the centre of A are\nmore strongly decelerated in the direction of the collision\nthan its outer parts due to stronger dynamical friction\nand they therefore show a smaller redshift difference. A\ntidal gravitational shock during the crossing scatters the\nouter galaxies of both clusters to large projected distance,\nthus increasing the extent of the cluster halos beyond their\nnominal virial radius. If the transverse velocity imparted\non a galaxy that is now found at a radial distance of\n3h\u22121 Mpc is 1000 km s\u22121 , then the time since core crossing\nis about 3 Gyrs, and the separation between the cores of\nthe two clusters is roughly 5 Mpc.\nThe main unknown in this scenario is the mass ratio\nbetween the subclusters. There are two possible versions\nof this collision:\n2\nBalogh et al. (1999) use data from the CNOC1 cluster redshift survey, which has limiting Gunn r magnitudes between\n20.5 and 22.0, depending on the redshift of the observed cluster\n(Yee et al. 1996).\n\n\fO.

Czoske et al.: Spectroscopic survey of Cl0024+1654: II.\n\n(i) A small group has passed through the core of\nCl0024+1654 and has been completely disrupted and\nscattered by the cluster's tidal force. In this case the\nmain body of Cl0024+1654 is unperturbed and we do\nnot observe a concentration of foreground galaxies belonging to the original group because the system has\nbeen completely unbound and is scattered to large distances perpendicular to the main cluster.\n(ii) A massive cluster of approximately 50% of the mass\nof Cl0024+1654 collided and passed through the core\nof the main cluster roughly 3 Gyr ago. This collision is\ninsufficient to completely disrupt the impacting cluster\nbut its outer galaxies are scattered to large projected\ndistances. The remaining bound core of the colliding\ncluster undergoes sufficient dynamical friction to turn\nits orbit around and in redshift space it appears to lie\nat a similar distance to Cl0024+1654.\nBoth of these scenarios can reproduce the main features\nof the observed redshift distribution. However, the massive collision scenario is more interesting because of the\npossibility of resolving both the mass discrepancy problem and the conflict between the central density structure\nof Cl0024+1654 and predictions of hierarchical clustering\nmodels.\nThe mass reconstructions of Cl0024+1654 (Tyson\net al. 1998; Broadhurst et al. 2000) using the positions of multiple images of a gravitationally lensed background galaxy show a projected mass of 1.3\u00d71014 h\u22121 M\u2299\nwithin 106 h\u22121 kpc and a central surface mass density of\n7900 h M\u2299 pc\u22122\u221a. For a singular isothermal halo extending\nto r200 /kpc \u2248 2 \u03c31d /(km s\u22121 ) this implies a characteristic velocity dispersion larger than 1500 km s\u22121 in order to\nexplain the projected mass.\nAs Shapiro & Iliev (2000) point out, the situation is\nworse in the context of hierarchical clustering models.\nDark matter halos in cold dark matter (CDM) type models are shallower than isothermal in their centres. In order\nto reproduce the observed projected mass a CDM halo\nwith velocity dispersion of 2200 km s\u22121 is required. This is\ninconsistent with the observations presented in this paper.\nA second problem for hierarchical models is that Tyson\net al. (1998) infer a very shallow central density profile for\nthis cluster, much flatter than the cuspy density profiles\nfound for clusters in CDM type models (Ghigna et al.\n2000). The central core of Cl0024+1654 has frequently\nbeen used to constrain the nature of dark matter and\nto argue for alternative candidates to CDM (Spergel &\nSteinhardt 2000; Hogan & Dalcanton 2000; Moore et al.\n2000).\nA high speed encounter between two similar mass clusters can explain all of the observations presented in Sect.\n2 and reconcile the discrepancy between mass estimates\nderived for Cl0024+1654. We now explore this scenario\nusing high resolution numerical simulations of colliding\ndark matter halos to study the evolution of the mass distribution. We construct two equilibrium CDM halos with\nvirial masses 9.5 \u00d7 1014 M\u2299 and 5.0 \u00d7 1014 M\u2299 with peak\n\ncircular velocities vpeak = 1600 and 1300 km s\u22121 and concentrations c = 5 and c = 7 respectively. Their initial separation is 3 Mpc and relative velocity is \u22123000 km s\u22121 . The\nparticle mass is set to 5\u00d7109 M\u2299 and we use an equivalent\nPlummer force softening of 5 kpc.\nAfter the collision we find that the outer regions of\nthe smaller cluster have become unbound and are streaming radially away from the impact location. The impulse\nvelocity perpendicular to the encounter is of the order\n1000 km s\u22121 . Snapshots of the initial and final times are\nshown in Fig. 6. The peak circular velocities of the bound\ncomponents have fallen to 1430 and 1140 km s\u22121 whilst\nthe central 1D velocity dispersions have reduced to 930\nand 710 km s\u22121 from initial values of 1033 and 883 km s\u22121\nrespectively. At the final time we find a total mass within\na cylinder of radius 106 kpc of 8.0 \u00d7 1013 M\u2299 .\n\nThe redshift distribution of 10 000 randomly selected\nparticles at the final time is shown in the right hand panel\nin Fig. 7. This is not a perfect match to the observational\ndata but the main features are present: we see a foreground component of \"galaxies\" that span large projected\ndistances from the central region of Cl0024+1654. This\ncomponent is separated by \u2248 3000 km s\u22121 in redshift space\nfrom the main component. The smaller cluster bound core\nis moving away from the main cluster at \u2248 1000 km s\u22121\n\u2013 the reduction in speed from the initial velocity is due\nto dynamical friction. A better agreement would result if\nthe impacting cluster was slightly more massive in which\ncase it would suffer more friction and would be seen nearly\nat rest compared to the main component. Also note that\nwe are plotting \"dark matter particles\" not \"galaxies\".\nOf course the initial configuration shown in the left panel\nin Fig. 7 also displays a bimodal distribution of redshifts.\nHowever, this configuration is more symmetric than either\nthe final simulated configuration or the observed redshift\ndistribution; also, the radial extent, in particular of the\nforeground (in redshift space) component, is much smaller\nthan observed.\nThe energy from the impulsive tidal shock has been\ntransferred into kinetic energy of the particles, heating\nand expanding the cold central cores of the clusters. This\nleads to a flattening of the physical and projected density profiles. In Fig. 8 we show the projected surface mass\ndensity profile before and after the encounter. The initial\nprofiles are cuspy, CDM type density profiles whereas the\nfinal profiles have nearly constant density cores in good\nagreement with that inferred from the mass reconstruction (Tyson et al. 1998, their Figure 4). The central surface\nmass density is 4000 M\u2299 pc\u22122 which is very close to the\nvalue obtained by Tyson et al. for H0 = 50 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 .\nThe total projected mass within the central 106 kpc is\nabout 30% lower than obtained by Broadhurst et al.\n(2000) which could be reconciled by using a more massive\nencounter and/or properly including the baryonic matter.\n\n\fO. Czoske et al.: Spectroscopic survey of Cl0024+1654: II.\n\n7\n\n4. Comparison to other observations\n\n4.2. X-ray observations\n\nThe galaxy distribution of Cl0024+1654 in redshift space\nand on the sky, as described in Sect. 2, provides strong\nhints that this is not a simple relaxed system. How do\nthe skewed central velocity dispersion and the presence of\na foreground component in redshift space affect the interpretation of other observations and in particular mass\nestimates of this system?\n\nThe X-ray observations from Rosat/HRI and ASCA\n(Soucail et al. 2000; B\u00f6hringer et al. 2000) by themselves show no indication of anything other than a fairly\nsmall cluster of galaxies. Given the measured values\nfor Cl0024+1654, TX = 5.7+4.9\n\u22122.1 keV and LX = 6.8 \u00d7\n1043 h\u22122 erg s\u22121 (Soucail et al. 2000), the gas does not\nseem too far away from the LX \u2212TX relation of Markevitch\n(1998); it is slightly too hot for its luminosity. The morphology is regular and the surface brightness profile well\nfitted by a beta profile with a surprisingly small core radius of 33 h\u22121 kpc. Whereas no significant substructure is\nrequired to model the X-ray observations of Cl0024+1654,\nthey do not provide evidence against the collision scenario\neither.\nThe X-ray emission is difficult to predict in the context of two clusters projected along the line-of-sight several Gyr after a head-on collision. During the collision,\nhydrostatic equilibrium in the gas component of the cluster(s) breaks down and the X-ray luminosity and emissionweighted temperature fluctuate considerably (by up to\na factor of 10 for LX ) and rapidly as a consequence of\nthe formation of shock waves and repeated expansion and\ncompression of the core gas (Takizawa 1999; Ricker &\nSarazin 2001; Ritchie & Thomas 2001). After several Gyr\nhowever, shocks have dissipated and the gas settles down\nto an equilibrium configuration. The cited hydrodynamic\nsimulations of cluster mergers consider collision speeds of\nabout 1000 km s\u22121 ; in this case the dark matter cores separate to distances of only a couple of Mpc before turning around and eventually merging into one clump. In a\nhigh-speed collision, however, the collisionless dark matter cores of the two clusters separate to large distance\nbefore turning around. The gas, due to its collisional nature should experience stronger interaction during the first\ncrossing and thus behave quite differently from the dark\nmatter/galaxies and possibly also from what low-speed\ncollision simulations predict. Ricker & Sarazin (2001) observe a slight segregation between the gas and the dark\nmatter cores in their simulations. This effect should be\nmore pronounced in a high-speed collision.\nIf we accept the collision scenario then a mass estimate\nfrom the X-ray observations is not possible. Detailed inclusion of a hydrodynamic treatment of the gas component in simulations of high-speed collisions is necessary to\nunderstand the behaviour of the X-ray emission in this\ncase. High resolution X-ray imaging with Chandra has\nrecently been obtained (P. I. Hattori) but has not been\npublished yet.\n\n4.1. Galaxy dynamics\nDynamical mass estimates rely on the assumption that\nthe galaxies are in virial equilibrium in the cluster's gravitational potential well and that their velocities are purely\nrandom.\nThe large velocity dispersion of \u03c3 \u2248 1200 km s\u22121 found\nby Dressler & Gunn (1992) and Dressler et al. (1999)\n(hereafter D99) was based on galaxies within 5\u2032 from the\nprojected cluster centre. As shown in Fig. 9, there is no\ndirect evidence for the bimodality of Cl0024+1654 when\nattention is restricted to the central regions of the cluster.\nThis is still true with the larger number of galaxy spectra used here: Whereas our catalogue contains about 85%\nmore redshifts in this area than D99, the general shape of\nthe histogram is the same. Both histograms are strongly\nskewed towards low redshifts, thus indicating the presence\nof substructure (Ashman et al. 1994) or a bulk velocity\ncomponent. Note that the bimodality of the redshift distribution only becomes apparent when galaxies at larger\nprojected distances from the cluster centre are included.\nIn this case it is therefore not the number of galaxy redshifts but their distribution over a wide field that provides\nthe clues to the complexity of this system.\nThe formal velocity dispersion for the 193 galaxies\nwithin 5\u2032 (Fig. 9)is \u03c3cent = 1050 km s\u22121 . If there is indeed\na bulk velocity component present in the central velocity\ndistribution, then mass estimates based on the formal central velocity dispersion will overestimate the true cluster\nmass.\nA better dynamical mass estimate might be obtained\nfrom the velocity dispersion at larger radii, where the two\ncomponents A and B are clearly separated. At projected\ndistances > 3\u2032 the velocity distribution of component A\nis regular with a dispersion of \u223c 600 km s\u22121 . If we interpreted this value as the velocity dispersion of a relaxed\ncluster, it would have only about a quarter of the mass\npreviously estimated for Cl0024+1654 (Schneider et al.\n1986), below mass estimates from gravitational lensing\n(which are roughly consistent with a high velocity dispersion) and even below mass estimates from X-ray observations. In the context of the collision scenario presented\nin Section 3 on the other hand, the galaxies at large projected distance from the cluster centre are also affected by\nthe collision and cannot be used to derive a mass estimate\nbased on the assumption of dynamical equilibrium.\n\n4.3. Gravitational lensing\nGravitational lensing by clusters of galaxies does not\nrely on the matter in the clusters being in dynamical\nequilibrium. However, gravitational lensing measures the\nweighted integral of all the mass between the observer and\nthe source, and the interpretation of the measured mass\n\n\f8\n\nO. Czoske et al.: Spectroscopic survey of Cl0024+1654: II.\n\nvalue thus depends on the detailed distribution of mass\nalong the line-of-sight.The skew in the central redshift distribution in Cl0024+1654 is an indication of bulk motion,\npossibly due to a high-speed collision between two fairly\nmassive clusters of a mass ratio of roughly 2:1, or by the\npassage of a small group through the core of Cl0024+1654.\nIn the latter case the mass determined by strong lensing\nmodels would indeed be indicative of the mass of the main\ncluster; however, in this case one would expect the X-ray\nemitting gas to be largely unperturbed by the collision,\nand one would be left with the discrepancy between the\nmass estimates derived from lensing and X-rays. In the\nformer case, the lensing mass would be the sum of the\ntwo cluster cores and therefore too large if interpreted as\nrepresenting the mass of a single cluster.\nThe projected mass profile for the post-merger system\nseen in our simulations shows two characteristics which are\ntestable by gravitational lensing analyses of Cl0024+1654:\nAt small scales of several 10's kpc, the profile shows a flat\ncore which is consistent with strong lensing mass models\n(Tyson et al. 1998), as shown in Sect. 3. On large scales\nthe profile is significantly flatter than the initial CDM profile, falling only as r\u22122.5 out to \u223c 3 Mpc. Previous weak\nlensing analyses on Cl0024+1654 have not attempted a\ndetailed reconstruction of the mass profile. Bonnet et al.\n(1994) and van Waerbeke et al. (1997) derived shear maps\nfrom ground-based data on the north-east quadrant of the\ncluster, Smail et al. (1997) were restricted to the small\nfield of view of HST/WFPC2. The shear pattern found\nby Bonnet et al. (1994) is compatible with an isothermal\nsphere profile, \u03c1 \u221d r\u22122 out to 3 h\u22121 Mpc.\nA weak lensing analysis of newly obtained\nCFHT/CFH12k images in BVRI is currently underway (Czoske et al. 2002, in preparation). Also, a sparsely\nsampled HST/WFPC2 mosaic consisting of 38 pointings\nout to a distance of 2.5 h\u22121 Mpc from the cluster centre\nhas recently been obtained; these data will also be used\nfor a weak lensing analysis (Treu et al. 2001). These data\nwill allow to probe the cluster's projected radial mass\nprofile accurately to the edge of the survey field.\n\n5. Discussion and conclusions\nIn the present paper we have analyzed the galaxy distribution in the cluster of galaxies Cl0024+1654, based on\n\u223c 300 galaxy redshifts and projected positions. The cluster, which was previously regarded as a prototype of a\nmassive relaxed cluster at intermediate redshift, turns out\nto have a fairly complicated structure, showing a strongly\nskewed redshift distribution in its central parts and two\nwell-separated components at larger projected distances\nout to \u223c 3 h\u22121 Mpc.\nWe argue that the blue tail of the central velocity distribution and the foreground component originate\nfrom the same physical system and interpret the peculiar\nredshift-space distribution as the result of a high-speed\nhead-on collision of two clusters of galaxies, the merger\naxis being very nearly parallel to the line-of-sight. Using\n\na numerical simulation we show that it is possible to explain the observed redshift distribution with a high-speed\ncollision of two rather massive clusters of galaxies with a\nmass ratio of about 2:1.\nApart from reproducing the spatial/redshift distribution of the cluster galaxies, this scenario also produces a\nprojected mass distribution which is very close to that derived by Tyson et al. (1998) from the quintuple arc system\nobserved in Cl0024+1654. Note that the scenario was not\ndesigned to reproduce this mass profile. Since it is thus\npossible to produce a mass distribution with a flat core\nfrom the merger of two CDM halos this eliminates one of\nthe main arguments against simple non-interacting cold\ndark matter as the dynamically dominant component in\nclusters of galaxies (Spergel & Steinhardt 2000).\nThe distribution of spectral types in the foreground\ncomponent B is more akin to the general field population\nthan to a cluster population. In the context of our collision scenario, these would correspond to the outer regions\nof the smaller cluster which have become unbound during the impact. Even initially, these galaxies would probably not correspond to a fully transformed cluster galaxy\npopulation. In addition, the impact might have triggered\nadditional star formation in these galaxies. Remembering\nthat Cl0024+1654 was one of the most distant clusters in\nwhich the Butcher-Oemler effect was detected (Butcher\n& Oemler 1984; Dressler et al. 1985), this may add a\nnew view on this effect: The fact that \u223c 40% of the\nbright galaxies in the cluster are emission line galaxies\n([O ii]> 5 \u00c5) has a natural interpretation in the collision\nscenario. The spectral distribution of the galaxies in component A (and centre) are also perturbed by the collision\nwith a possible excess of rHDS and SF/SBB (Tables 1 and\n2); rHDS galaxies may represent the result of a starburst\ninduced during the early stages of the interaction.\nThe relative velocity of the clusters of \u223c 3000 km s\u22121\nimplied by the redshift distribution in Cl0024+1654 is\nvery high. Observations and simulations find mean peculiar velocities for clusters of order 500 km s\u22121 (Bahcall\n& Oh 1996; Giovanelli et al. 1998; Gibbons et al. 2001;\nColberg et al. 2000). Still, colliding clusters can reach relative velocities of about 3000 km s\u22121 at separations of about\n1 Mpc (Sarazin 2001). Markevitch et al. (2001) have recently found a bow shock in the galaxy cluster 1E0657-56\nwhich implies a relative speed of 3000 to 4000 km s\u22121 for\nthe collision. Cl0024+1654 is still an extraordinary but\nnot an impossible system.\nAcknowledgements.
