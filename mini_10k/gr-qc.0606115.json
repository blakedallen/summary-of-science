We show how the tensorial recursion of Geroch\nand Hansen can be replaced by a scalar recursion on R2 . We also give\na bound on the multipole moments. This gives a proof of the \"necessary\npart\" of a long standing conjecture due to Geroch.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe relativistic multipole moments of asymptotically flat spacetimes have been\ndefined by Geroch [6] for static spacetimes and then generalised to the stationary\ncase by Hansen [7]. Together with Beig's [1] generalised definition of centre of\nmass this gives a coordinate independent description of all asymptotically flat\nstationary spacetimes.\nHowever, the tensorial recursion which defines the multipole moments (1),\nis computationally rather complicated as it stands. In the axisymmetric (static\nor stationary) case, on the other hand, it was shown, [3], [4] that the recursion\ncan be replaced by a scalar recursion on R, and that all the moments can be\ncollected into one complex valued function y on R, where the moments are given\nby the the derivatives if y at 0.\nIn the general case, the multipole of order 2n has 2n + 1 degrees of freedom,\nas compared to one degree of freedom in the axisymmetric case. Therefore,\napart from the technical problems, it is not obvious what form a generalisation\nto the general case should take. In this paper, we show that also in the general\nstationary case, the recursion (1) can be simplified to a scalar recursion, this\ntime on R2 . This is shown using normal coordinates, complex null geodesics,\nand exploiting the extra conformal freedom of the conformal compactification.\nUsing this simplification we can partially confirm an extension of a long\nstanding conjecture by Geroch [6]:\nGiven any set of multipole moments, subject to the appropriate convergence condition, there exists a static solution of Einstein's equations having precisely those moments.\nThis conjecture has its natural extension to the stationary case.\n\u2217 Department\n\nof Mathematics, Link\u00f6ping University, SE-581 83 Link\u00f6ping, Sweden.\ne-mail: thbac@mai.liu.se, maher@mai.liu.se\n\n1\n\n\fIn this paper we will state the appropriate convergence condition in the\ngeneral stationary case, i.e., we will prove that this condition is necessary for\nexistence of a stationary solution to Einstein's equations.\n\n2\n\nMultipole moments of stationary spacetimes\n\nIn this section we quote the definition of multipole moments given by Hansen in\n[7], which is an extension to stationary spacetimes of the definition by Geroch\n[6]. We thus consider a stationary spacetime (M, gab ) with timelike Killing\nvector field \u03be a . We let \u03bb = \u2212\u03be a \u03bea be the norm, and define the twist \u03c9 through\n\u2207a \u03c9 = \u01ebabcd \u03be b \u2207c \u03be d . If V is the 3-manifold of trajectories, the metric gab (with\nsignature (\u2212, +, +, +)) induces the positive definite metric\nhab = \u03bbgab + \u03bea \u03beb\non V . It is required that V is asymptotically flat, i.e., there exists a 3-manifold\nV\u0302 and a conformal factor \u03a9 satisfying\n(i) V\u0302 = V \u222a \u039b, where \u039b is a single point\n(ii) \u0125ab = \u03a92 hab is a smooth metric on V\u0302\n(iii) At \u039b, \u03a9 = 0, D\u0302a \u03a9 = 0, D\u0302a D\u0302b \u03a9 = 2\u0125ab ,\nwhere D\u0302a is the derivative operator associated with \u0125ab . On M , and/or V one\ndefines the scalar potential\n\u03c6 = \u03c6M + i\u03c6J ,\n\n\u03c6M =\n\n\u03c9\n\u03bb2 + \u03c9 2 \u2212 1\n, \u03c6J =\n.\n4\u03bb\n2\u03bb\n\nThe multipole moments\u221a\nof M are then defined on V\u0302 as certain derivatives of the\nscalar potential \u03c6\u0302 = \u03c6/ \u03a9 at \u039b. More explicitly, following [7], let R\u0302ab denote\nthe Ricci tensor of V\u0302 , and let P = \u03c6\u0302. Define the sequence P, Pa1 , Pa1 a2 , . . . of\ntensors recursively:\nPa1 ...an = C[D\u0302a1 Pa2 ...an \u2212\n\n(n\u22121)(2n\u22123)\nR\u0302a1 a2 Pa3 ...an ],\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere C[ * ] stands for taking the totally symmetric and trace-free part. The\nmultipole moments of M are then defined as the tensors Pa1 ...an at \u039b. The requirement that all Pa1 ...an be totally symmetric and trace-free makes the actual\ncalculations very cumbersome.\nIn [2], [9] it was shown that (when the mass is non-zero) there exist a conformal factor \u03a9 and a chart, such that all components of the metric \u0125ab and\nthe potential \u03c6\u0302 are analytic in terms of the coordinates, in a neighbourhood\nof the infinity-point. Expressed in these coordinates, the exponential map becomes analytic. Therefore, we can use Riemannian normal coordinates and still\nhave analyticity of the metric components and the potential. If the mass is\nzero, this analyticity condition will be assumed. Thus, henceforth we assume\nthat \u03a9 is chosen such that the (rescaled) metric and potential are analytic in a\nneighbourhood of \u039b.\n\n2\n\n\f3\n\nMultipole moments through a scalar recursion\non R2\n\nSuppose that (x1 , x2 , x3 ) = (x, y, z) are normal coordinates (with respect to \u0125ab )\ncentred around \u039b. This means that for any constants a = a1 , b = a2 , c = a3 the\ncurve t \u2192 (at, bt, ct) is a geodesic, i.e. in terms of coordinates that\n\u1e8di + \u0393ikl \u1e8bk \u1e8bl = \u0393ikl ak al = 0\nwhere the Christoffel symbols are evaluated at (at, bt, ct) for appropriate t. Due\nto analyticity, this relation holds for complex values of a, b, c, i.e., we can consider\ngeodesics in the complexification V\u0302C of V\u0302 . Of particular interest is the oneparameter family of curves:\n\u03b3\u03c6 : t \u2192 (t cos \u03c6, t sin \u03c6, it),\n\nt \u2208 [0, t0 ), \u03c6 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0)\n\n\u2202 a\n\u2202 a\nfor some suitable t0 . The tangent vector \u03b7 a = \u03b7\u03c6a (t) = cos \u03c6( \u2202x\n1 ) +sin \u03c6( \u2202x2 ) +\n\u2202 a\na\ni( \u2202x3 ) is seen to be a complex null vector along \u03b3\u03c6 . Namely, from \u03b7 D\u0302a \u03b7 b = 0,\nwe infer that \u03b7 a D\u0302a (\u03b7 b \u03b7b ) = 0. The (constant) value of \u03b7 b \u03b7b is then found to be\n0 by evaluation at t = 0.\np\nNext, consider the mapping F : R2 \u2192 VC : (\u03be, \u03b6) \u2192 (\u03be, \u03b6, i \u03be 2 + \u03b6 2 ). We let\nS denote the 2-surface F (U ) \u2282 V\u0302C , where U \u2282 R2 is a suitable neighbourhood\nof (\u03be, \u03b6) = (0, 0). S is then a smooth surface, except at \u039b where it has a vertex\npoint, closely resembling a null cone in a three dimensional Lorentzian space.\nThe curves \u03b3\u03c6 are given by \u03b3\u03c6 (t) = F (t cos \u03c6, t sin \u03c6), and in particular \u03b7 a lies\nalong S. This suggests that we use the polar coordinates \u03c1, \u03c6 around \u039b on\nS defined via \u03be = \u03c1 cos \u03c6, \u03b6 = \u03c1 sin \u03c6. We now follow the approach from [4],\nwhere a useful vector field \u03b7 a on V\u0302 was introduced. In [4], where the spacetime\nwas axisymmetric, \u03b7 a was explicitly expressed in terms of the metric cast in\nthe Weyl-Papapetrou form [10], and was defined on the whole of V\u0302 except\non the symmetry axis. In this paper the axisymmetry condition is dropped,\nwhich makes the construction of a corresponding \u03b7 a more difficult. In addition,\na general spacetime has 2n + 1 degrees of freedom for the multipole moment\nof order 2n , compared to one degree of freedom in the axisymmetric case [8].\nNevertheless, it will turn out to be sufficient to know the potential \u03c6\u0302 on S to\ndetermine all the moments. On S, \u03b7 a has the following properties.\n\nLemma 1. Suppose V\u0302 and S are defined as above. Then there exists a regularly\ndirection dependent (at \u039b) vector field \u03b7 a on S with the following properties:\na) \u03b7 a D\u0302a \u03b7 b is parallel to \u03b7 b .\nb) For all tensors Ta1 ...an , \u03b7 a1 . . . \u03b7 an Ta1 ...an = \u03b7 a1 . . . \u03b7 an C[Ta1 ...an ],\nc) At \u039b, Pa1 ...an (in V\u0302 ) is determined by \u03b7 a1 . . . \u03b7 an Pa1 ...an (on S)\nProof. a) was demonstrated above, b) follows as in [4], while c) requires a different argument. A totally symmetric and trace-free tensor Pa1 ...an has 2n + 1\ndegrees of freedom, and in Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) it can be expressed\nvia the components P x......x y........y z and P x......x y......y . 1 Therefore, at \u039b, we\n| {z } | {z }\n| {z } | {z }\nj\n\n1 In\n\nj\n\nn\u2212j\u22121\n\nn\u2212j\n\nbrief, any index occurrence of several z's can be removed via Pzz... + Pxx... + Pyy... = 0.\n\n3\n\n\fcan write\nPa1 ...an =\n\nn\nX\n\naj C[(dx)a1 . . .

(dy)an\u22121 (dz)an ]\n\nj=0\n\nContracting with \u03b7 a1 . . . \u03b7 an , and using lemma 1b we find that\n\u03b7 a1 . . . \u03b7 an Pa1 ...an =\n\nn\nX\n\naj cosj \u03c6 sinn\u2212j \u03c6 + i\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\nbj cosj \u03c6 sinn\u22121\u2212j \u03c6\n\n(3)\n\nj=0\n\nj=0\n\nIf the left hand side is zero, the trigonometric polynomial to the right must be\nidentically zero. This means that all the coefficients an and bn are zero, and by\n(2) that Pa1 ...an is zero. In particular the 2n + 1 components in the RHS of (2)\nare linearly independent. This proves c).\nNote that although the moments are encoded in the coefficients an and\nbn , this encoding is dependent on the choice of normal coordinates, i.e., the\norientation of the coordinate axes in T\u039b V\u0302C .\nWe can now replace the recursion (1) on V\u0302 with a scalar recursion on S.\nAgain, we follow [4], and define\n(4)\nfn = \u03b7 a1 \u03b7 a2 . . . \u03b7 an Pa1 a2 ...an , n = 0, 1, 2, . . .\n\u221a\non S. In particular, f0 = P = \u03c6\u0302 = \u03c6/ \u03a9. The moments Pa1 a2 ...an (\u039b) will now\nbe encoded in the trigonometric polynomial given by the direction dependent\nlimit lim\u03c1\u21920 fn (\u03c1, \u03c6), which takes the form in (3). See also lemma 3. Note that\nalthough Pa1 a2 ...an is analytic on V\u0302 , fn will not be analytic in terms of \u03be, \u03b7 since\n\u03b7 a is direction dependent at \u039b \u2208 S. In general we have the following lemmas:\nLemma 2. Suppose that f is an analytic function, on a ball of radius r0 around\n\u039b on V\u0302 . Then the restriction of f to S, fL , can be decomposed as fL (\u03be, \u03b6) =\nf1 (\u03be, \u03b6) + i\u03c1f2 (\u03be, \u03b6), where f1 and f2 are analytic in terms of \u03be and \u03b6 on the\np\nr2\ndisk \u03be 2 + \u03b6 2 < 20 , and where \u03c1 = \u03be 2 + \u03b6 2 . Furthermore, if f is real-valued\nthen f1 and f2 are real-valued.\nProof. We start by splitting f = f (x, y, z) into its even, fe , and odd, fo , part\nwith respect to z. We can now rewrite fe (x, y, z) = f \u0303e (x, y, z 2 ) and fo (x, y, z) =\nz f \u0303o (x, y, z 2 ), where both f \u0303e and f \u0303o are analytic in their arguments (at least near\n(0, 0, 0)). The restriction of f \u0303e to S gives f1 : f1 (\u03be, \u03b6) = f \u0303e (\u03be, \u03b6, \u2212(\u03be 2 + \u03b6 2 )),\nwhile the restriction of f \u0303o gives f2 : f2 (\u03be, \u03b6) = f \u0303o (\u03be, \u03b6, \u2212(\u03be 2 + \u03b6 2 )). Adding these,\nand also noting that z \u2192 i\u03c1 gives the required decomposition. On S we have\nr2\n|z|2 = \u03be 2 + \u03b6 2 , hence \u03be 2 + \u03b6 2 < 20 implies x2 + y 2 + z 2 < r02 . This gives the\ndomain of analyticity. The reality follows from the construction.\nRemark: In fL , the subscript L stands for the 'leading term'.\nAlthough tensor fields on V\u0302 can be pulled back to S \\ {\u039b}, we will only need\ntheir contractions with the appropriate number of \u03b7 a vectors. This contraction\nwill introduce a direction dependence which shows up in the following lemma.\n4\n\n\fLemma 3. Suppose Ta...b is an analytic tensor field on a ball of radius r0\naround \u039b on V\u0302 . Then the scalar field fL = \u03b7 a . . . \u03b7 b Ta...b on S can be written\nas fL (\u03be, \u03b6) = \u03c11n (f1 (\u03be, \u03b6) + i\u03c1f2 (\u03be, \u03b6)), where f1 and f2 are analytic (on the disk\np\nr0\nwith radius \u221a\naround the origin) in terms of \u03be and \u03b6, and where \u03c1 = \u03be 2 + \u03b6 2 .\n2\nFurthermore, if Ta...b is real-valued then f1 and f2 are real-valued.\nProof. Consider the scalar field g = xa . . . xb Ta...b on V\u0302 , where\n\u0012 \u0013a\n\u0012 \u0013a\n\u0012 \u0013a\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\nxa = x\n+y\n+z\n.\n\u2202x\n\u2202y\n\u2202z\nThis scalar field is analytic on the same ball as Ta...b . Hence we can use lemma 2\nto obtain analytic functions f1 and f2 such that gL = f1 + i\u03c1f2 . The reality also\nfollows from lemma 2. Furthermore, xa = \u03c1\u03b7 a on S. Thus gL = \u03c1n fL . But fL\nis bounded near the origin, thus we can divide gL by \u03c1n and get the lemma.\nWe remark that the boundedness of fL (\u03be, \u03b6) = \u03c11n (f1 (\u03be, \u03b6) + i\u03c1f2 (\u03be, \u03b6)) when\n\u03c1 \u2192 0 implies that both f1 and f2 have zeros of sufficient order at (\u03be, \u03b6) = (0, 0).\nIt also implies that fL will be direction dependent there.\nWe can now contract (1) with \u03b7 a and get the following theorem.\nTheorem 4. Let V\u0302 and S be defined as in sections (2) and (3). Let \u03b7 a have\nthe properties given by lemma 1, and let fn be defined by (4).Then the recursion\n(1) on V\u0302 takes the form\nfn = \u03b7 a D\u0302a fn\u22121 \u2212\n\n(n\u22121)(2n\u22123) a b b\n\u03b7 \u03b7 Rab fn\u22122\n2\n\n(5)\n\non S. The moments of order 2n are captured in the direction dependent limit\nlim\u03c1\u21920 fn (\u03c1, \u03c6).\nProof. That (1) takes the form (5) follows exactly as in [4] using that \u03b7 a D\u0302a \u03b7 b =\n0, although the recursion is defined only on S rather than on V\u0302 . The last\nstatement is the content of lemma 1c.\n\n3.1\n\nSimplified calculation of the moments\n\nIn this section, we will show that it is possible to obtain the recursion (5)\nwithout the term involving the Ricci tensor. This will be accomplished by\nusing the conformal freedom at hand, i.e. change \u03a9. The conformal freedom is\n1\n2\n\u03a9 \u2192 \u03a9\u0303 = \u03a9\n\u03b1 where \u03b1 is analytic near \u039b with \u03b1(\u039b) = 1 . D\u0302a ( \u03b1 ) at \u039b gives a shift\nof the moments which corresponds to a 'translation' of the physical space, [6].\nHence we can assume that D\u0302a ( \u03b31 ) = 0 at \u039b. It is to be noted that a change of \u03a9\n\u221a\nchanges the (rescaled) potential \u03c6/ \u03a9. It also changes the normal coordinates\non V\u0302 , and hence all conclusions must be made with some care. In order to derive\nthe simplified recursion (14), we will specify a \u03b1 through \u03b1L , the restriction of\n\u03b1 to S. However, in order to deduce that there exists a real-valued function \u03b1\nwhich the prescribed values of \u03b1L , we need to say more on the representation\nof \u03b1L . This result and a useful estimate is the content of lemma 5.\n2 A more natural condition is the equivalent statement \u03a9 \u2192 \u03a9\u0303 = \u03a9\u03b1. However, this\nformulation gives slightly neater calculations.\n\n5\n\n\fLemma 5. Let fL = f1 (\u03be, \u03b6) + i\u03c1f2 (\u03be, \u03b6) where\nf1 and f2 are analytic on the\np\nball U = {|\u03be|2 + |\u03b6|2 < r02 }, and where \u03c1 = \u03be 2 + \u03b6 2 . We can then write\nfL (\u03c1 cos \u03c6, \u03c1 sin \u03c6) =\n\nl\n\u221e X\nX\n\ncl,m eim\u03c6 \u03c1l ,\n\n(6)\n\nl=0 m=\u2212l\n\nwhere\n\nl\n\u221e X\nX\n\nl=0 m=\u2212l\n\n|cl,m |\u03c1l < \u221e , \u03c1 < r0 .\n\n(7)\n\nFurthermore, the converse is true; if fL is a function satisfying (6) and (7)\nthen there are functions f1 and f2 analytic in U such that fL = f1 + i\u03c1f2 . The\nfunctions f1 and f2 are real-valued if and only if the coefficients cl,m satisfy\nc\u0304l,m = (\u22121)l\u2212m cl,\u2212m .\nx\u2212y\nx+y x\u2212y 3\nProof. Form the functions f1 ( x+y\n2 , 2i ) and f2 ( 2 , 2i ). These functions are\nanalytic in terms of x and y. Therefore there exist coefficients cl,m such that\n\nfj (\n\n\u221e\n\nl\n\nXX\nx+y x\u2212y\n,\n)=\ni1\u2212j cl+j\u22121,2k\u2212l xk y l\u2212k ,\n2\n2i\n\n(8)\n\nl=0 k=0\n\nwhere j = 1 or 2, and\nl\n\u221e X\nX\n\nl=0 k=0\n\nx\u2212y 2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n1\n|cl+j\u22121,2k\u2212l ||x|k |y|l < \u221e , | x+y\n2 | + | 2i | = 2 (|x| + |y| ) < r0 .\n1\n2\n2 (|x|\n\nNow let x = \u03c1e\u2212i\u03c6 and y = \u03c1ei\u03c6 .

A reorganisation gives the\nfirst part of the lemma. The converse is given by the substitution x = \u03be + i\u03b6 and\ny = \u03be \u2212 i\u03b6 in (8). The series converges absolutely for |\u03be|2 + |\u03b6|2 = \u03c12 < r02 .\nWe now show that we can choose \u03b1 such that the Ricci term in (5) vanishes.\nLemma 6. There exists a real-valued real analytic function \u03b1 on V\u0302 such that\nthe Ricci tensor R\u0303ab of the new metric h\u0303ab = \u03b1\u22122 \u0125ab satisfies \u03b7\u0303 a \u03b7\u0303 b R\u0303ab = 0 on S\u0303,\nwhere both \u03b7\u0303 a , S\u0303 and the mapping F are defined in terms of coordinates which\nare normal with respect to the new metric h\u0303ab .\nProof. We first demonstrate that we can make \u03b7 a \u03b7 b R\u0303ab = 0 on S. From [10]\nR\u0303ab = R\u0302ab + \u03b11 D\u0302a D\u0302b \u03b1 + \u03b1\u22121 \u0125ab \u0125cd D\u0302c D\u0302d \u03b1 \u2212 2\u03b1\u22122 \u0125ab \u0125cd (D\u0302c \u03b1)D\u0302d \u03b1.\nOn S, (using \u03b7 a and S belonging to \u0125ab ), this becomes\n\u03b7 a \u03b7 b R\u0303ab = \u03b7 a \u03b7 b R\u0302ab +\n3 Although\n\n1 a b\n\u03b1L \u03b7 \u03b7 D\u0302a D\u0302b \u03b1L\n\n= \u03b7 a \u03b7 b R\u0302ab +\n\n1 \u2202 2 \u03b1L\n\u03b1L \u2202\u03c12\n\n(10)\n\nwe will always take \u03be and \u03b6 to be real, they are temporarily complexified in this\n\nproof.\n\n6\n\n\fwhere we have used \u03b7 a D\u0302a \u03b7 b = 0. In order to make \u03b7 a \u03b7 b R\u0303ab = 0, we require\n\u03b1L\u03c1\u03c1 + \u03b7 a \u03b7 b R\u0302ab \u03b1L = 0.\n\n(11)\n\nNote that, on V\u0302 , R\u0302ab satisfies the conditions of lemma 3, therefore from lemma 3\nand lemma 5 it follows that\n\u03b7 a \u03b7 b R\u0302ab =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nbn+2 (ei\u03c6 , e\u2212i\u03c6 )\u03c1n ,\n\n(12)\n\nn=0\n\nwhere each bn is a polynomial of degree at most n. It is easy to see that the reality condition from lemma 5 is equivalent to bn (ei\u03c6 , e\u2212i\u03c6 ) = (\u22121)n bn (\u2212ei\u03c6 , \u2212e\u2212i\u03c6 ).\nHence the reality of R\u0302ab implies this condition. Moreover, since R\u0302ab is analytic\nin a neighbourhood of \u039b, there exists a \u03c10 such that for any fixed \u03c6, the series\n(12) converges for all \u03c1 < \u03c10 . Well known ODE theory gives that for each fixed\n\u03c6 there exists a solution \u03b1L , analytic in \u03c1 for 0 \u2264 \u03c1 < \u03c10 , i.e., for all \u03c6 we have\n\u03b1L =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nan (\u03c6)\u03c1n ,\n\n\u03c1 < \u03c10 .\n\nn=0\n\nWe note that a0 = 1 while a1 can be chosen to be 0 (translation). \u03b1L will have\nthe right regularity if we can show that each an (\u03c6) is a polynomial in ei\u03c6 and\ne\u2212i\u03c6 of degree at most n. Equation (11) becomes\n\u2212\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=0\n\nn(n \u2212 1)an \u03c1n\u22122 =\n\n\u221e X\n\u221e\nX\n\nbn+2 aj \u03c1n+j .\n\nn=0 j=0\n\nEquating powers of \u03c1 we get\n\u2212(n + 2)(n + 1)an+2 =\n\nn\nX\n\nm=0\n\nbm+2 an\u2212m ,\n\nn \u2265 0.\n\n(13)\n\nThe polynomials a0 and a1 has maximal degree 0 respective 1. The polynomials\nbn has maximal degree n. Straightforward induction shows that an has maximal\ndegree n. Induction and (13) also implies an (ei\u03c6 , e\u2212i\u03c6 ) = (\u22121)n an (\u2212ei\u03c6 , \u2212e\u2212i\u03c6 ).\nThus, due to lemma 5, there are real-valued analytic functions \u03b11 and \u03b12 such\nthat \u03b1L = \u03b11 + i\u03c1\u03b12 . The function \u03b1 = \u03b11 (x, y) + z\u03b12 (x, y) is then a real-valued\nanalytic extension of \u03b1L to a ball in V\u0302 . This shows that there exist an \u03b1 such\nthat \u03b7 a \u03b7 b R\u0303ab = 0 on S.\nHowever, it then also follows that \u03b7\u0303 a \u03b7\u0303 b R\u0303ab = 0 on S\u0303. From \u03b1 we get \u03a9\u0303 =\n\u03a9/\u03b1, and the corresponding new metric h\u0303ab = \u03b1\u22122 \u0125ab . Note that in (5), where\nbab = 0, the recursion is stated in terms of D\u0302a , i.e., it is expressed\nnow \u03b7 a \u03b7 b R\nin terms of \u0125ab instead of h\u0303ab . From h\u0303ab we get new normal coordinates, i.e.,\n(x, y, z) in T\u039b V\u0302C , are mapped into V\u0302C using the exponential map belonging to\nh\u0303ab . We then construct \u03b7\u0303 a and the mapping F with respect to these coordinates.\nNow, null geodesics, of which S consists, are conformally invariant, although\nthey become non-affinely parametrised. This means that \u03b7\u0303 a \u221d \u03b7 a , and that\npoints in S are mapped into points in S\u0303. Thus \u03b7\u0303 a \u03b7\u0303 b R\u0303ab \u221d \u03b7 a \u03b7 b R\u0303ab = 0 on S\u0303\n(or S).\n\n7\n\n\fHenceforth we denote all entities defined via h\u0303ab instead of \u0125ab with a tilde.\nIn particular, D\u0303a will denote the derivative operator associated with h\u0303ab . Applying lemma 6 to theorem 4 we immediately get the following theorem.\nTheorem 7. Let V\u0302 and S\u0303 be defined as in sections (2) and (3), where S\u0303 is\ndefined in terms of normal coordinates connected to h\u0303ab . Let \u03b7\u0303 a have the properties given by lemma 1 with respect to h\u0303ab , and let f \u0303n be defined by (4) with \u03b7\u0303 a\nreplacing \u03b7 a . Then the recursion (1) on \u1e7c takes the form\n\u2202n\nf \u0303n = \u03b7\u0303 a D\u0303a f \u0303n\u22121 = (\u03b7\u0303 a D\u0303a )n f \u03030 = n f \u03030\n\u2202 \u03c1\u0303\n\n(14)\n\non S\u0303. The moments of order 2n are captured in the direction dependent limit\nlim\u03c1\u0303\u21920 f \u0303n (\u03c1\u0303, \u03c6).\nProof. Since \u03b7\u0303 a D\u0303a is \u2202\u2202\u03c1\u0303 , each f \u0303n is easily derived from f \u03030 . Also, from lemma\n1c), we (again) know that the 2n + 1 degrees of freedom of Pa1 ...an at \u039b are\nencoded in f \u0303n .\n\n4\n\nBounds on the moments\n\nAll multipole moments are encoded in f \u03030 , and we note that the recursion (14)\nis identical to the recursion emanating from a scalar function in R3 (after inversion). It is clear that many different functions on R3 will produce the same\nmoments, but if we also require that the function, g say, is harmonic, g is\nuniquely determined by the moments.\nThus, provided that we can connect a function which is harmonic in a neighbourhood of 0 \u2208 R3 to each f \u03030 , we have the following theorem:\nTheorem 8. Suppose that (M, gab ) is a stationary asymptotically flat spacetime, admitting an analytic (rescaled) potential and an analytic chart4 on the\nconformally compactified manifold of timelike Killing trajectories, around the\ninfinity point \u039b. Then there exist a (flat-)harmonic function g in a neighbourhood of 0 \u2208 T\u039b V\u0302 \u223c\n= R3 , such that all multipole moments of M are given by\nPa1 ...an (\u039b) = (\u2207a1 . . . \u2207an g)(0),\n\n(15)\n\n3\nwhere \u2207a in the LHS of (15) is the flat derivative operator in\nputs a\nP R . This\n\u03b1\nbound on the multipole moments, since the Taylor expansion |\u03b1|\u22650 r\u03b1! (\u2202\u03b1 g)(0)\nof g converges in a neighbourhood of the origin in R3 .\n\nProof. By lemma 5 we have\nf \u0303L (\u03c1 cos \u03c6, \u03c1 sin \u03c6) =\n\n\u221e X\nl\nX\n\ncl,m eim\u03c6 \u03c1l ,\n\n\u03c1 < r0\n\nl=0 m=\u2212l\n\nfor some r0 > 0, and we know that f \u0303L fully determines the moments of M .\nWe will now define the function g, which will be shown to be harmonic in\na neighbourhood of the origin. Finally we will argue that g has the correct\n4 As\n\ndiscussed before, the analyticity has been proved for the case with non-zero mass.\n\n8\n\n\fderivatives at 0, i.e., that the equality (15) is valid (for all n \u2265 0).

We will do this by forming gL and\nthen compare with f \u0303L . Note, however, that f \u0303L is defined on S\u0303 \u2282 VC , while gL\nwill be defined on the corresponding surface S\u0304 = Sh\u0303ab (\u039b) in T\u039b V\u0302C . (By S\u0304 we\ndenote the surface defined by F as previously, but where F now maps (\u03be, \u03b6)\ninto T\u039b V\u0302C via the flat metric h\u0303ab (\u039b).) This means that fL and gL really can be\n9\n\n\fcompared only at \u039b (i.e. 0 \u2208 T\u039b V\u0302 ), where also the equality (15) is evaluated.\nOn the other hand, the radial derivatives of both entities are well defined and\ncomparable at \u039b. In other words, if both f \u0303L and gL are equal when expressed in\nterms of the coordinates \u03be, \u03b6, they will produce the same derivatives/moments.\nTo summarise; in the case of g, the function F and the vector \u03b7 a are simply\ninterpreted in T\u039b V\u0302C rather than in VC .\nTo proceed, we recall that\ns\n(2l + 1)(l \u2212 |m|)! |m|\nPl (cos \u03b8)eim\u03c6\nYlm (\u03b8, \u03c6) = im\u2212|m|\n4\u03c0(l + |m|)!\nfor \u2212l \u2264 m \u2264 l, and that\nPlm (cos \u03b8) = (\u22121)m 2\u2212l sinm \u03b8\n\n\u0004 l\u2212m \u0005\n2\nX\nk=0\n\n(\u22121)k (2l \u2212 2k)!\ncosl\u2212m\u22122k \u03b8\nk!(l \u2212 k)!(l \u2212 2k \u2212 m)!\n\nwhere 0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c0 and m \u2265 0. Therefore,\ng(r, \u03b8, \u03c6) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nl\nX\n\nl=0 m=\u2212l\n\n\u0004 l\u2212|m| \u0005\n\u221a\n2\nX\ncl,m \u03c0(l \u2212 |m|)!(2l \u2212 2k)!eim\u03c6 \u03c1|m| z l\u2212|m|\u22122k r2k\nk=0\n\nil\u2212|m| (\u22121)k 4l k!(l \u2212 k)!(l \u2212 |m| \u2212 2k)!\u0393(l + 21 )\n\n,\n\nwhere z = r cos \u03b8, \u03c1 = r sin \u03b8. When we take the restriction of g to S\u0304, i.e., form\ngL , only the terms with k = 0 survives since rL = 0. Thus\ngL (\u03c1 cos \u03b8, \u03c1 sin \u03b8) =\n\n\u221a\nl\n\u221e X\nl\n\u221e X\nX\nX\ncl,m \u03c0(2l)!eim\u03c6 \u03c1l\ncl,m eim\u03c6 \u03c1l = f \u0303L ,\n=\nl l!\u0393(l + 1 )\n4\n2\nl=0 m=\u2212l\nl=0 m=\u2212l\n\nwhich means that we have equality in (15).\n\n5\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this paper we have studied the multipole moments of stationary asymptotically flat spacetimes. By using normal coordinates, and by exploiting the conformal freedom, we could show that the tensorial recursion (1) could be replaced\nby the scalar recursion (14). This recursion is a direction dependent recursion\non R2 , where the moments are encoded in the direction dependent limits at \u039b.\nUsing this setup, we could also show that the multipole moments cannot\ngrow too fast. In essence, the rescaled potential behaves (locally) in the manner\nof a harmonic function on R3 . The bounds on the moments given in theorem\n8 gives the necessary part in a conjecture due to Geroch [6], and it is of course\ntempting to conjecture that this condition on the moments also will be sufficient\n(as long as the monopole is real-valued).\nWhether this can be proved using the techniques presented here is still an\nopen question.\nWe also remark that similar questions concerning the convergence of asymptotic expansions in the static case are currently being studied by Friedrich, using\na different technique, [5].\n10\n\n\fReferences\n[1] Beig, R., The Multipole Expansion in General Relativity, Acta Physica Austriaca, 53, 249 (1981).\n[2] Beig, R., Simon, W., On the multipole expansion for stationary spacetimes,\nProc.
