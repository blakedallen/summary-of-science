In this paper we present the analysis of these observations, and describe the potential applications\nof orbit mode observations for diffuse (extended) sources as well as GRBs.\n\n1. The VERITAS Imaging Atmospheric\nCherenkov Telescopes\nVERITAS [1][2], located at the Fred Lawrence\nWhipple Observatory (FLWO) in southern Arizona,\nUSA, is an array of four 12 meter diameter Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACT). VERITAS can detect gamma-rays with energies from 100\nGeV to 30 TeV with a flux of one percent of the Crab\nNebula in approximately 25 hours. VERITAS has an\nenergy resolution of 15-25%, an angular resolution of\n0.1 degrees (68% containment radius), and a pointing\naccuracy within 50 arc-seconds.\n\n2. Source Locations Reconstruction\nVERITAS observations are normally taken in wobble mode[3]. During an observation using wobble\nmode, the center of the camera is held at a fixed position in right ascension and declination offset from the\nintended targeted source [See Figure 1]. In orbit mode\nthe center of the camera circumscribes the source in\nright ascension and declination with an angular velocity and radial offset dependent on the type of source\n(point-like, extended, or a GRB). Typical values for\na point-like source are one revolution per 20 to 80\nminutes and a 0.5 degree radial offset [See Figure 2].\nUsing orbit mode, prior to rotation corrections to the\nfield of view, the source appears as a ring [See Figure\n3]. For each event there is an elevation and azimuth\nangle recorded. With this information and the elevation and azimuth of the telescopes, the reconstructed\ndirection can be found [See Figure 3]. Figure 4 shows\n\n\u2217 E-mail:\n\ngaryf@physics.utah.edu\n\neConf C110509\n\nthe pointed position (in right ascension and declination as a function of time) of each telescope followed\na smooth sine and cosine curve. During testing it has\nbeen shown that the angular velocity and radial offset\nare fairly constant [See Figure 5].\n\n3. Discussion\nThe orbit mode technique was developed to help\neliminate dead-time during transitions between wobble directions for data runs sets, to slightly increase\nthe area of the field of view by maintaining azimuthal\nsymmetry of the exposure around the source, and to\nproduce an uniform background estimate. In order to\nminimize the dead-time between runs, we had to test\nwhether the VERITAS data network could transfer\nfile sizes of twenty to thirty gigabytes. This was successfully done with a run during the daytime with the\ncharge injection system of the telescopes, and later on\nsingle eighty minute data run of Mrk 421 [See Figure\n6]. The typical time between data runs for slewing of\nthe telescopes can last one to two minutes. If implemented for regular data operations, orbit mode would\nadd additional thirty to sixty minutes of observation\ntime per night.\nOrbit mode has been developed to test whether\nthe background estimation using the reflected regions\nmethod[4] or ring background method[5] would be\nmore uniform and therefore increasing the sensitivity of the analysis. Preliminary results of the orbit\nmode analysis on the Crab Nebula produced 10.0\u00b10.6\ngamma-rays a minute. A wobble mode analysis was\nalso performed on the Crab Nebula with data taken\nthe same night at a similar zenith angle produced\n9.1 \u00b1 0.7 gamma-rays per minute.\nStars in the field of view can cause higher trigger\nrates in individual pixels, and therefore cause a higher\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\n2011 Fermi Symposium, Roma., May. 9-12\n\nFigure 1: Exposure area (left) of the wobble mode technique for four runs with East to West (or North to South)\nprofile (right)\n\nExposure [% time per run]\n\nOrbit Mode Exposure Profile\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n1\n2\n3\nDistance from the Source [Degrees]\n\nFigure 2: Exposure area (left) of the orbit mode technique with profile (right)\n\nbackground level in small regions of the sky. With the\nstars more rapidly rotating in the field of view during\norbit mode observations than during wobble mode observations, this may eliminate some of the background\nnoise in the small regions of the sky effected by the\nstars.\nGRB alerts have a large error associated with the\nposition. A GRB alert from the Fermi[6] LAT or\nFermi GBM[6] has an error of approximately 2\u25e6 or\n15\u25e6 (radius, one sigma) respectively. Orbit mode allows a rapid scan of a larger area (with a larger radial\neConf C110509\n\noffset) of the sky than wobble mode. For a Fermi\nLAT alert, the entire one sigma containment radius\ncan be observed in orbit mode with VERITAS in one\norbit. For a Fermi GBM alert, approximately twentyfive percent of the one sigma containment radius can\nbe observed with VERITAS in one orbit using orbit\nmode.\n\n\f3\n\n2011 Fermi Symposium, Roma., May. 9-12\n\nVERITAS:Crab\n350\n\nDeclinationJ2000 [Degrees]\n\nSouth \u2194 North\n\nOrbit Mode Around the Crab, Raw Events Map (Camera Plane)\n\n24\n\n250\n\n23.5\n\n300\n\n250\n\n200\n\n23\n\n22.5\n\n150\n200\n\n22\n\n150\n\n21.5\n\n100\n\n21\n\n100\n\n50\n50\n\n20.5\n\n0\n\n20\n\nEast \u2194 West\n\n0\n\n81.5\n\n82\n\n82.5\n\n83\n\n83.5\n\n84\n84.5\n85\nRight Ascension\n\nJ2000\n\n85.5\n86\n[Degrees]\n\nFigure 3: Image of the Crab Nebula (left) before rotation corrections are applied and before the background\nsubtraction.

Conclusion\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nOrbit mode observations have been successfully\ntested on the VERITAS telescopes. The telescopes\nhave performed exceptionally well with the orbit observation mode. Preliminary results of the Crab Nebula have already qualitatively demonstrated that orbit\nmode observations have a similar or better gamma-ray\ndetection rate to wobble mode observations for the\nCrab Nebula, a point source. Further observations\nand simulations are underway to quantify the comparison between the two observation modes, as well as\ndetermine the sensitivity of orbit mode for extended,\ndiffuse gamma-ray sources.\n\nThis research is supported by grants from the US\nDepartment of Energy, the US National Science Foundation, and the Smithsonian Institution, by NSERC in\nCanada, by Science Foundation Ireland, and by STFC\nin the UK.
