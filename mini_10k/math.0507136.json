An irreducible polynomial f = f (X, Y ) \u2208 A defines an\nirreducible plane curve. We shall denote its coordinate ring by R = A/(f ) and the canonical\nhomomorphism A \u2212\u2192 R shall be denoted by \u03c6f . In general we write \u03c6f (X) = x, \u03c6f (Y ) = y.\nFor any h = h(X, Y ) \u2208 A we shall denote by Jf (h) = Jf (h(X, Y )) its jacobian with f , namely\nhX fY \u2212 hY fX . The ideal in A generated by all such jacobians is denoted by Jf = (fX , fY )A.\nWe also need the extended ideal Jacf = (f, Jf )A. Note that for any u = g/h \u2208 qt(A) the\nquotient field of A, we can easily extend the definition to calculate Jf (u), by the usual rules of\nderivatives. We shall denote by J f the ideal \u03c6f (Jf ) \u2282 R.\nWe may often drop the reference to f if it is clear during a discussion and we may\ndrop explicit reference to \u03c6f as follows. We may write Jf (h(x, y)) or simply J(h(x, y)) to\ndenote the image \u03c6f (hX (X, Y )fY \u2212 hY (X, Y )fX ). If we consider u(X, Y ) = g(X, Y )/h(X, Y )\nwhere \u03c6f (h(X, Y )) = h(x, y) 6= 0, we have a well defined element of k(f ): \u03c6f (Jf (u)) =\n\u03c6f (Jf (g))/\u03c6f (h) \u2212 \u03c6f (gJf (h))/\u03c6f (h)2 . We have thus defined Jf (u(x, y) for any u(x, y) \u2208 k(f ).\n\nWe introduce the following additional notations for future use. Define \u03c7(f ; Q) to be the number\nof branches of f at Q, and let \u03c7(f ; Q) = \u03c7(f ; Q) \u2212 1. Let R denote the integral closure of R\nin its quotient field, i.e. the function field k(f ) of the curve f . We define the conductor ideal\nC(R, R) = {u \u2208 R | uR \u2282 R} and may shorten the notation to Cf or simply C for convenience.\nLet also C(f ; Q) be the conductor ideal of RQ\u2032 in its integral closure (denoted as RQ\u2032 ), where\nQ\u2032 = \u03c6f (Q). Let C(f ; Q) be the length l(RQ\u2032 /C(f ; Q)) as R-modules.\n\nUniversit\u00e9 d'Angers, Math\u00e9matiques, 49045 Angers cedex 01, France;\ne-mail: assi@univ-angers.fr\nUniversity of Kentucky, Lexington KY 40506, U.S.A.;\nemail:sathaye@uky.edu\n2000 Mathematical Subject Classification: 12F10, 14H30, 20D06, 20E22. During the development of this work,\nSathaye visited Universit\u00e9 d'Angers; he would like to thank that institution for hospitality and support.\n\u2217\n\n2\n\n\fWe define C(f ) to be the sum\n\nP\n\nQ\n\nC(f ; Q) over all points Q such that f passes thru Q.\n\nAs is well known, Cf is an ideal in R as well as R and has the property l(R/C) = 2l(R/C).\nFurther this is clearly equal to C(f ).\nWe have the usual module \u03a9(R, k) = \u03a9(R) of 1-differentials generated by dx, dy and subject\nto the relation fx dx + fy dy = 0. If h(x, y) \u2208 k(f ), such that dh 6= 0, then the differential\ndh(x, y)/Jf (h(x, y)) is easily seen to be independent of the choice of h when viewed as a member\nof \u03a9(k(f ), k). We will denote it by \u03c9 and call it the fundamental differential of f . In our zero\ncharacteristic case, the condition dh 6= 0 can be replaced by \"h is a non constant\".\n\nGiven non constant u \u2208 R, we have du 6= 0. For any valuation w of the function field k(f ) over\nk, recall that the value w(du) of the differential du is defined as follows. Choose a parameter\nt for the valuation w which is a separating transcendence (separability being automatic in our\ncharacteristic zero). We have du/Jf (u) = dt/Jf (t) and we define w(du) = w(Jf (u)/Jf (t)). It\nis then known that this is independent of the choice of the parameter t. In short, this can be\nalso described as w(du) = w(h) where h is chosen such that du = hdt for some (separating)\nuniformizing parameter t for w.\n\n2\n\nGeneralized Berger formula\n\nLemma 2.1 Let f \u2208 A be a non constant irreducible polynomial and using the above notation,\nlet\nJ \u2217 = ({Jf (u) | u \u2208 R})R\nThen we have:\nJ \u2217 = C = Cf .\nProof. Let w be any valuation at finite distance (i.e. the valuation ring of w contains R. By\nthe Dedekind formula for the conductor and differential [AS](28.15.1) we know that w(Jf (u)) =\nw(C) + w(du).\nSince u \u2208 R we get w(du) \u2265 0 and hence w(Jf (u)) \u2265 w(C). Thus w(J \u2217 ) \u2265 w(C). Further, if\nwe choose u to be itself a uniformizing parameter for w in R, then w(Jf (u)) = w(C) and thus\nthe minimum of values of elements of J \u2217 at w is actually equal to w(C). Thus w(J \u2217 ) = w(C)\nfor all valuations dominating the normal domain R and hence J \u2217 = C.\nCorollary 2.2 With the same setup as in Lemma 2.1, we have: C\u03c9 = \u03a9(R, k), where we recall\nthat \u03c9 is the fundamental differential of f as described above.\n\n3\n\n\fProof. Note that \u03a9(R, k) consists of sums of elements adu with a, u \u2208 R. We have adu =\naJf (u)\u03c9 \u2208 J \u2217 \u03c9. Thus \u03a9(R, k) \u2282 J \u2217 \u03c9. Similarly J \u2217 \u03c9 consists of sums of elements aJf (u)\u03c9 for\na, u \u2208 R. But aJf (u)\u03c9 = aJf (u)(du/Jf (u)) = adu \u2208 \u03a9(R, k). Thus J \u2217 \u03c9 \u2282 \u03a9(R, k).\nBy a similar argument we get the following:\n\nLemma 2.3 With the same setup as in Lemma 2.1, we have: J f \u03c9 = \u03a9(R, k).\nProof. Just imitate the argument of the above corollary.\nWe can now state the following:\nProposition 2.4 We the notations as explained above, we have:\nl(A/Jacf ) = l(R/J f ) = l(R/C) + l(C/J f ) = l(R/R) + l(\u03a9(R, k)/\u03a9(R, k))\nProof. The first equality is obvious and the second is clear since J f is contained in C.\nThe multiplication by the fundamental differential \u03c9 clearly gives an injective homomorphism\nof C into \u03a9(R, k) and we get:\nl(C/J f ) = l(C\u03c9/J f \u03c9)\nWe use Corollary 2.2. and Lemma 2.3 to get our quantity equal to l(R/C) + l(\u03a9(R, k)/\u03a9(R, k)).\nFinally, we use the well known fact that l(R/C) = l(R/R) to finish the proof.\nRemark 2.5 We now connect the above calculations with Zariski's concept of the torsion\nmodule of differentials. Let T (R) be the torsion module of (the R-module) \u03a9(R, k), i.e., the\nsubmodule consisting of the elements of \u03a9(R, k) which have a non vanishing annihilator. Explicitly, we see that:\nT (R) = {adx + bdy | a, b \u2208 R, uadx + ubdy = 0 for some nonzero u \u2208 R}.\n\nZariski showed that in case R is the local ring of an analytically irreducible plane curve, the\nlength of the torsion module satisfies:\nl(T (R)) = l(R/J f ).\nwhere f is the local equation. Zariski's arguments remain valid for our global case as well and\nwe get that this result continues to hold.\nZariski further used the Berger formula giving a local result similar to our global statement of\nProposition 2.4.\n\n4\n\n\fFinally, Zariski noticed that the term l(\u03a9(R, k)/\u03a9(R, k)) depends on the structure of the equation and is at most equal to the adjacent term ( the length of the integral closure over the\ncoordinate ring or equivalently the length of the conductor ideal in the coordinate ring). He\nshowed that it reaches this maximum value if and only if under a suitable local analytic change\nof coordinates the curve becomes y m \u2212 xn for coprime natural numbers m, n.\n\nThe result depends on the analytic irreducibility, i.e. the property of having only one place at\nthe point. The main theme of our paper is to globalize this result by showing that it continues\nto hold under the assumption that the global curve has only one place at infinity.\nSaito has generalized the Zariski result in a different direction. His result states that a local\nhypersurface with an isolated singularity is (locally) quasihomogeneous if and only if its equation\nbelongs to the jacobian ideal. [SA] Unfortunately, his function theory proof has not yet been\ntransformed to an algebraic form.\n\n3\n\nAlgebraic invariants associated with the curve f\n\nLet the notations be as in Section 2. In the following, we shall introduce invariants associated\nwith the curve f . Let Q \u2208 j-Spec(A) (i.e. Q is a maximal ideal in A. We also describe it\nas a point in the plane). We recall the intersection multiplicity of f and g at Q, denoted\nby int(f, g; Q), to be the length of the AQ -module AQ /(f, g)AQ . Note that this length is\nfinite exactly when f, g don't have a common factor passing thru Q, or equivalently, (f, g)AQ is\nprimary for QAQ . Also, it is positive, if and only if both the curves pass thru the point.\nP We recall\nthe total intersection multiplicity of f with g in A, denoted by int(f, g; A) =\nint(f, g; Q)\ntaken over all the points in the plane.\nMilnor numbers: Let f \u2208 A be non constant. We define\n\u03bc(f ; Q) = l(AQ /Jf AQ ) = int(fX , fY ; Q).\nand call it the (local) Milnor number of f at Q. Note that this is finite if and only if f is\nreduced, i.e. does not have a multiple factor thru Q. We also define \u03bc(f ) the affine Milnor\nnumber of f as the sum of the local Milnor numbers over all points Q such that f passes thru Q,\ni.e. f \u2208 Q. Note that this is finite if and only if f hasP\nno multiple factors. We define the Milnor\nnumber of the pencil (f \u2212a)a\u2208k \u03bc(f ; A) by \u03bc(f ; A) = a\u2208k \u03bc(f \u2212a). Clearly, \u03bc(f ; A) = l(A/Jf )\nand \u03bc(f ; A) = \u03bc(f \u2212 a; A) for all a \u2208 k. Note that this is finite if and only if all members of\nthe pencil {f \u2212 a} are reduced.\nTjurina numbers: Let f \u2208 A be irreducible (non constant). We define\n\u03bd(f ; Q) = l(AQ /Jacf AQ ) \u2243 l(R\u03c6f (Q) /(J f )R\u03c6f (Q) )\nand call it the local Tjurina number. We also define \u03bd(f ) the affine Tjurina number of f as\nthe sum over all points Q such that f passes thru Q. Clearly, \u03bd(f ) = l(A/Jacf A) = l(R/J f R).\n5\n\n\fThe Tjurina numbers can be also defined for reduced f and will still be finite.1\nIn view of Zariski's work and our observations above, the Tjurina numbers could also be defined\nas lengths of the corresponding torsion modules of the module of differentials (locally as well\nas globally).\nDefect numbers: Let f \u2208 A be irreducible (non constant). Since Jf \u2282 Jacf , we define\n\u03b4(f ; Q) = \u03bc(f ; Q) \u2212 \u03bd(f ; Q) = l(Jf AQ /Jacf AQ )\nand call it the local defect number of f . We define \u03b4(f ) the affine defect of f as the sum of\nlocal defects \u03b4(f ; Q) taken over all the points Q such that f passes thru Q.\nThus: \u03bc(f ) = \u03b4(f ) + \u03bd(f ), i.e. Milnor=Tjurina+defect.\nZariski numbers: Let f \u2208 A be non constant. We define Z(f ; Q) = l(C(f ; Q)/J f RQ\u2032 ) where\nQ\u2032 = \u03c6f (Q). We call it the local Zariski number of f at Q. We also define the affine Zariski\nnumber Z(f ) of f , as the sum of local Zariski numbers Z(f ; Q) taken over all the points Q\nsuch that f passes thru Q. Note that then Z(f )) = l(Cf /J f ).\nWe now observe some useful relations between these numbers.\nLemma 3.1 Suppose f \u2208 A is irreducible (non constant) and passes thru a point Q. Then\n\u03bc(f ; Q) + \u03c7(f ; Q) = C(f ; Q).\nProof. The result is well known. We indicate an outline.\nFirst choose suitable local coordinates so that Q is the maximal ideal generated by X, Y and\nthat X is not tangential to f at Q, i.e. at every valuation of f centered at Q, the image\nx = \u03c6f (X) has minimal value in the ideal (x, y). From the Dedekind formula we deduce that\nE1.\n\nC(f ; Q) = int(f, fY ; Q) \u2212 int(f, X; Q) + \u03c7(f ; Q)\n\nNext, by considering the coordinate ring of fY and noticing that modulo any irreducible factor\ndf\nof fY we have fx = dx\n, we deduce that\nE2.\n\nint(f, fY ; Q) = int(fX , fY ; Q) + int(X, fY ; Q)\n\nBy nontangentiality of X, we further get that\nE3.\n\nint(X, fY ; Q) = int(X, f ; Q) \u2212 1\n\nThe result follows by combining these equations.\nLemma 3.2 If f \u2208 A is irreducible (non constant) and passes thru a point Q then we have\n\u03bc(f ; Q) = \u03bd(f ; Q) + \u03b4(f ; Q) = C(f ; Q)/2 + Z(f ; Q) + \u03b4(f ; Q).\n1\n\nWe could also define a Tjurina number for a pencil, but so far no useful consequences of such a definition\nare known, hence we refrain from making such a definition. For the same reason, defect numbers below are also\nnot defined for pencils.\n\n6\n\n\fProof. The first equality is by definition, while the second follows the obvious fact that\n\u03bd(f ; Q) = l(R\u03c6f (Q) /C(f ; Q)) + Z(f ; Q).\nand the fact that the first term is half the length C(f ; Q) of the conductor ideal in the integral\nclosure.\nLemma 3.3 If f \u2208 A is unibranch and passes thru Q then we have \u03bc(f ; Q) = C(f ; Q) and\nfurther\nZ(f ; Q) + \u03b4(f ; Q) = C(f ; Q)/2.\nIn particular, the maximum possible value for the local Zariski number is C(f ; Q)/2 and it is\nattained exactly when \u03b4(f ; Q) = 0.\nProof. By Lemma 3.1, we get that \u03bc(f ; Q) = C(f ; Q) and now Lemma 3.2 gives the result.\nLemma 3.4 If f \u2208 A is an irreducible (non constant) curve. then we have the following:\nC(f ) = \u03bc(f ) + \u03c7(f ) = C(f )/2 + Z(f ) + \u03b4(f ) + \u03c7(f ).\nIn particular,\nC(f )/2 \u2212 Z(f ) = \u03b4(f ) + \u03c7(f ).\nProof. This is simply obtained by adding up the results from Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2 over all\npoints of the curve f .\nRemark 3.5 Zariski's result can now be described as a necessary and sufficient condition for\nmaximality of Z(f ; Q) or vanishing of the defect. To describe this, let us change coordinates so\nthat Q = (X, Y ) and consider f \u2208 A \u2282 k[[X, Y ]]. We say that f is formally quasihomogeneous\nat Q if there is a change of variables k[[X, Y ]] = k[[X \u2032 , Y \u2032 ]] such that after giving some positive\nweights to X \u2032 , Y \u2032 a local equation becomes a sum of equal weight monomials in X \u2032 , Y \u2032 . It is\neasy to see that by irreducibility of f and a further change of coordinates if necessary, we may\nassume that f = u((X \u2032 )m \u2212 (Y \u2032 )n ) where u is a unit in the power series ring and m, n are\n(necessarily comprime) positive integers. We can now restate\nZariski Theorem \u03b4(f ; Q) = \u03c7(f ; Q) = 0 if and only if f locally irreducible and formally\nquasihomogeneous at Q.\nWe shall be imitating Zariski's original proof in a global setting.\n\n7\n\n\f4\n\nOne place curves\n\nLet the notations be as in Section 1. The curve f is said to have one place at infinity if there\nis only one valuation of its function field k(f ) over k which does not contain the coordinate\nring R. Several important properties of such curves are well known from the Abhyankar-Moh\ntheory. We summarize them briefly.\n\n4.1\n\nSetup\n\nSuppose that f (X, Y ) 6\u2208 k[X] has one place at infinity (or equivalently f (X, Y ) \u2208 k((X))[Y ] is\nirreducible). Then it is essentially monic in all coordinate systems and can be written as\nf (X, Y ) = 0\n\nY n + a1 (X)Y n\u22121 + * * * + an (X) \u2208 k[X, Y ]\n\nwhere 0 is the well known \"Abhyankar non zero\", a symbol denoting some non zero constant\nin k. Be aware that this symbol can denote different quantities even in the same expression.\nThe highest X-degree term of f can then be described as 0 X m . We can and usually do\nassume that f is actually monic in Y .\nLet v denote the unique valuation at infinity and denote by \u0393(f ) the semigroup consisting of\nall v(h) as h varies over non zero elements of R. Note that \u0393(f ) is a subset of \u2212N the set\nof negatives of natural numbers. The structure and generation of this semigroup is the center\npiece of the Abhyankar-Moh theory.\n\n4.2\n\nCharacteristic quantities\n\nThere is a well defined sequence of numbers ri \u2208 \u0393(f ) for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 h where\nr0 = v(x) = \u2212n, r1 = v(y) = \u2212 degX (f (X, Y )).\nDenoting the GCD(r0 , * * * , ri\u22121 ) by di we get that d1 = n \u2265 d2 > * * * dh > dh+1 = 1. Further\nthese di successively divide the earlier ones and we define ni = di /di+1 for i = 1, * * * h. We\nadditionally make two special definitions d0 = m and n0 = d0 /d2 .\nThere is a natural sequence of (essentially ) monic polynomials\ng0 = X, g1 = Y, g2 (X, Y ), * * * , gh (X, Y )\nsuch that the Y -degrees of gi are d1 /di = n/di for i = 1, * * * h. Besides this degree condition,\nwe also have that v(gi (x, y)) = ri for i = 0, * * * h.\n\nHaving made f monic in Y , the gi may be chosen to be the approximate n/di -th roots of f ,\nwhich means, the unique polynomial of Y -degree n/di such that degY (f \u2212 gidi ) < n \u2212 n/di . In\ngeneral, the chosen polynomials are called pseudo-approximate roots and are said to form an\nassociated g-sequence.\n8\n\n\f4.3\n\nAdmissible expansions\n\nThe polynomials give a standard basis for R over k in the following sense.\nA sequence a = (a0 , * * * , ah ) of integers is said to be admissible if it satisfies the following two\nconditions of admissibility:\nHigher level condition:\n\nni > ai \u2265 0 for i = 1, * * * h and\n\nLevel zero condition:\na0 \u2265 0 Then by a standard g-monomial we mean an expression\nah\na0\na\ng = g0 * * * gh , where a = (a0 , * * * , ah ) is admissible.\n\nThe main theorem of the Abhyankar-Moh theory is that the set of standard monomials form\na k-basis for R and moreover, the values v(g a ) = a0 r0 + * * * + ah rh are distinct for distinct\nadmissible a.\nIn particular\n\u0393(f ) = {a0 r0 + * * * + ah rh where (a0 , a1 , * * * , ah ) is admissible }.\nIt canP\nbe shown by simple properties of integers that every integer w has a unique expression\nh\nw =\n0 (bi ri ), where the sequence b = (b0 , * * * , bh ) satisfies higher level admissibility and\nw \u2208 \u0393(f ) if and only if b0 \u2265 0 i.e. the zero level admissibility holds as well.\n\n4.4\n\nProperties of the Semigroup of values\n\nDefine an integer:\n\u0398 = \u0398(f ) = \u2212r0 +\n\nh\nX\n1\n\n(ni \u2212 1)ri .\n\nAs a consequence of the above description, easy calculations show that given integers p, q with\np + q = \u0398 we have that exactly one of p, q \u2208 \u0393(f ).\n\nIn particular, since \u0393(f ) has no positive integers, all integers less than \u0398 are in \u0393(f ) while\n\u0398 6\u2208 \u0393(f ). The integer \u22121 + \u0398 is called the conductor of the semigroup \u0393(f ) and is necessarily\nan even number, since exactly half the integers between 0 and it are not in the semigroup. We\nshall denote it by C(\u0393(f )) and we have the formula:\nC(\u0393(f )) = \u22121 \u2212 r0 +\n\n4.5\n\nh\nX\n1\n\n(ni \u2212 1)ri .\n\nA conductor formula\n\nLet us observe that this conductor of the semigroup is connected with the length of the conductor ideal of the coordinate ring of the curve by the formula:\nC(\u0393(f )) = \u2212C(f ) \u2212 2Pg (f )\n9\n\n\fwhere Pg (f ) denotes the geometric genus of the function field k(f ). Among its various equivalent\ndefinitions, let us choose the one which says that it is the integer which equals 1 plus half the\ndegree of the divisor of any nonzero differential inPthe function field. Explicitly, given any\nnonzero differential adb we know that 2Pg (f ) \u2212 2 = w w(adb) where the sum is taken over all\nvaluations of the function field k(f ) over k and the values w(adb) are as described in section 1.\nFor our affine curve, we can conveniently choose the fundamental differential \u03c9 = dx/fy as\ndescribed in section 2. The sum of values for valuations at finite distance is easily seen to be\n\u2212C(f ) by the Dedekind formula and hence the order of \u03c9 at the valuation v at infinity is seen\nto be C(f ) + 2Pg (f ) \u2212 2.\n\nOn the other hand, we can compute it explicitly thus: Since v(x) = r0Pwe have v(dx) = r0 \u2212 1\nand v(fy ) is well known by the Abhyankar-Moh theory to be equal to h1 (ni \u2212 1)ri . 2 Thus we\nget\nh\nX\n(ni \u2212 1)ri = C(f ) + 2Pg (f ) \u2212 2.\nv(< \u03c9) >) = \u22121 + r0 \u2212\n1\n\nThus we have as claimed:\n\u2212C(f ) \u2212 2Pg (f ) = \u22121 \u2212 r0 +\n\n4.6\n\nh\nX\n1\n\n(ni \u2212 1)ri = C(\u0393(f )).\n\nA formula for the Milnor number of the pencil.\n\nWe recall that the Milnor number for the pencil (f \u2212 a)a\u2208k is defined as \u03bc(f ; A) = l(A/Jf ). By\nan argument similar to our proof in Lemma 3.1 we can argue that\nint(fX , fY ; A) = int(f, fY ; A) \u2212 int(X, fY ; A) = \u2212\n\nh\nX\n1\n\n(ni \u2212 1)ri + 1 + r0 .\n\nFor proof, we note that the left hand side can be interpreted as the negative of the sum of values\nat valuations at infinity for fY , with suitable adjustment made for reducible fY . The fact that\nint(f \u2212 a, fY ; A) is independent of a, being purely in terms of the characteristic terms common\nto all translates f \u2212 a and the fact that f is necessarily essentially monic in Y guarantee that\nf, x have negative orders at each valuation at infinity of fY and hence our reductions are simply\nvalid. Thus we get the global Milnor number\n\u03bc(f ; A) =\n\nX\na\u2208k\n\n\u03bc(f \u2212 a) = 1 + r0 \u2212\n\nh\nX\n1\n\n(ni \u2212 1)ri = \u2212C(\u0393(f )).\n\nProposition 4.1 If f \u2208 A is a curve with one place at infinity, then we have\n\u03bc(f ; A) = C(f ) + 2Pg (f ) = \u03bc(f ) + \u03c7(f ) + 2Pg (f ) = \u03bd(f ) + \u03b4(f ) + \u03c7(f ) + 2Pg (f )\n2\n\nThis is worked out by starting with an NP expansion as described later in this\nQ section and explicitly\ndetermining the t-order of the resultant Resultant(f, fY , Y ) interpreted as a product (\u03b7(t) \u2212 \u03b7(\u03b6t)), where \u03b6\nvaries over non identity n-th roots of 1.\n\n10\n\n\fProof. This follows by using already obtained results from Lemmas in Section 3 as well as\nconclusions of Sections 4.5 and 4.6.\nCorollary 4.2 If f is a curve with one place at infinity such that \u03bc(f ; A) = \u03bd(f ) then we have\nthat f is a rational curve which is unibranch and locally quasihomogeneous at all its points.\nFurther all translates of f are nonsingular. Moreover, Z(f ) = l(\u03a9(R, k)/\u03a9(R, k)) = C(f )/2.\nProof. It follows from the Proposition 4.1 that \u03b4(f ) + \u03c7(f ) + 2Pg (f ) = 0 and since all the\nquantities are nonnegative, each is zero. This proves the first assertion. It follows that \u03bc(f ; A) =\nC(f ) = \u03bc(f ). Thus \u03bc(f \u2212 a) = 0 for all a 6= 0 giving that all translates of f are nonsingular.\nThe last result follows from C(f ) = \u03bd(f ) using Proposition 2.4.\n\n4.7\n\nConnection with the NP (Newton-Puiseux) expansion.\n\nAll the above quantities can either inductively be described and calculated from the known\nvaluation, or they can be deduced from the NP expansion which defines the valuation at\ninfinity.\nThe NP expansion is a power series parametrization:\nx = \u03c4 \u2212n , y = \u03b7(\u03c4 ) = 0\n\n\u03c4 \u2212m + * * * \u2208 k((\u03c4 )).\n\nThe valuation v can then be described as v(p(x, y)) = ord\u03c4 (p(\u03c4 \u2212n , \u03b7(\u03c4 )).\nWe refer the reader to look up any of the following sources: [A1],[SS],[S],[AM1],[AM2], for the\ndefinition of the associated characteristic sequences and calculations.\nFor future use, we prove:\nLemma 4.3 Suppose that f \u2208 A has one place at infinity and an NP expansion\nx = \u03c4 \u2212n , y = \u03b7(\u03c4 ) = 0\nThen there are no terms of the form 0\nProof. Write \u03b7(\u03c4 ) =\n\nP\u221e\n\n\u2212m\n\n\u03c4 \u2212m + * * * \u2208 k((\u03c4 )).\n\n\u03c4 ns in the expansion of \u03b7(\u03c4 ) for s > 0.\n\nai \u03c4 i . We know that\nY\nf=\n(Y \u2212 \u03b7(\u03b6\u03c4 )).\n\u03b6 n =1\n\nand the coefficient of Y n\u22121 is then easily seen to be the trace \u2212\n\nX\n\n\u03b7(\u03b6\u03c4 ) where we substitute\n\n\u03b6 n =1\n\nX for \u03c4 \u2212n . Suppose if possible, X\ns > 0 and ans 6= 0. Then we get that the term Y n\u22121 X \u2212s\n(\u03b6 ns ) = \u2212ans (n). Since the coefficient of Y n\u22121 must be a\nhas the nonzero coefficient \u2212ans\n\u03b6 n =1\n\npolynomial in X, we get a contradiction, thereby proving the result.\n11\n\n\f5\n\nRational one place curves\n\nLet the notations be as in the Section above. Assume that f defines a rational curve. It follows\nby a modification of the L\u00fcroth theorem that it is a \"polynomial curve\" which means that there\nare two polynomials X(T ), Y (T ) in a new indeterminate T , such that f (X(T ), Y (T )) = 0 and\nat least one of X(T ), Y (T ) is a non constant.\nAs before, let us take the image \u03c6f (T ) = t and write x(t) = \u03c6f (X(T )), y(t) = \u03c6f (Y (T )), so\nthat f (x(t), y(t)) = 0. By choosing minimal t-degrees for x, y, we may assume k(f ) = k(t) and\nhence R = k[t]. It follows that Pg (f ) = 0 and hence C(\u0393(f )) = \u2212C(f ). Also we have\nl(R/R) = l(R/C) = C(f )/2 = \u2212C(\u0393(f ))/2.\nThe (unique) valuation v at infinity of f is now seen to be the 1/t-adic valuation which can be\nsimply described as v( a(t)\n) = degt (b(t)) \u2212 degt (a(t)). The order v(a(t)db(t)) can now be seen\nb(t)\nas v(a(t)) + v(b(t)) \u2212 1 as long as a(t)d(b(t)) 6= 0, i.e. 0 6= a(t) \u2208 k(t) and b(t) \u2208 k(t) \\ k.\nWe easily see that the set\n\n{v(h) | 0 6= h \u2208 R = k[t]} = \u2212N\nthe set of all negative natural numbers. The semigroup of the curve is a subset of this with\nexactly (\u22121/2)C(\u0393(f )) = (1/2)C(f ) missing values.\nWe now prove:\nLemma 5.1 With the notation as above, let \u0393\u2217 (f ) = {v(p) | p \u2208 \u03a9(R, k)} the set of values of\nelements in \u03a9(R, k) and \u0393\u2032 (f ) = {v(u) \u2212 1 | u \u2208 R \\ k}, the set of values of exact differentials\ndu \u2208 \u03a9(R, k). Further, set: M = \u2212N \\ \u0393\u2217 (f ). We have the following:\n1. \u0393\u2032 (f ) \u2286 \u0393\u2217 (f ).\n2. Z(f ) = the number of elements of M.\n3. The cardinality of \u2212N \\ \u0393\u2032 (f ) is clearly \u2212C(\u0393(f ))/2 and hence Z(f ) \u2264 \u2212C(\u0393(f ))/2 and\nthe inequality is strict if and only if \u0393\u2217 (f ) is strictly bigger than \u0393\u2032 (f ) or equivalently\nthere is some element p \u2208 \u03a9(R, k) which is not exact.\nProof. The first statement is obvious.\nGiven any element a \u2208 \u03a9(R, k) = k[t]dt we claim that\n\u2022 a \u2208 \u03a9(R, k) or,\n\u2022 there is an element b \u2208 \u03a9(R, k) such that v(a \u2212 b) \u2208 M.\n\n12\n\n\fIf a 6\u2208 \u03a9(R, k), then we can choose b \u2208 \u03a9(R, k) which maximizes the value of v(a \u2212 b), since\nall values in question are bounded above by 0. If v(a \u2212 b) \u2208 M then we are done. Otherwise,\nthere exists b\u2217 \u2208 \u03a9(R, k) such that v(a \u2212 b) = v(b\u2217 ). Then v(a \u2212 b \u2212 \u03bbb\u2217 ) > v(a \u2212 b) for some\n\u03bb \u2208 k, contradicting the choice of b.\nHence v(a \u2212 b) \u2208 M as claimed.\n\nThis shows that we can make a basis of \u03a9(R, k)/\u03a9(R, k) consisting of elements with distinct\nvalues in M, proving our first second assertion.\nThe last assertion easily follow.\nWe now summarize the results.\nProposition 5.2 Let f \u2208 A be a curve with one place at infinity. Then \u03bc(f ; A) = \u03bd(f ) if and\nonly if f is a rational curve which is locally unibranch at all its points and all differentials in\n\u03a9(R, k) are exact.\nProof. We have already proved the only if part in view of Corollary 4.2 except for the claim\nof exactness of differentials. This claim follows from Lemma 5.1, since under our hypothesis we\nknow that \u2212C(\u0393(f )) = C(f ).\n\nThe if part easily follows from the Proposition 4.1, since our hypothesis implies that the quantities Pg (f ), \u03c7(f ), \u03b4(f ) are all zero.\nWe now define the following terms. Let z1 , z2 be non constant elements of the function\nfield k(f ) of an irreducible curve and let w be any valuation of k(f ) over k. The differential\n\u03b2(z1 , z2 ; w) = w(z1 )z1 dz2 \u2212 w(z2 )z2 dz1 is defined to be the basic differential associated\nwith the pair (z1 , z2 ) corresponding to the valuation w.\nWe also define the gap of the basic differential \u03b2(z1 , z2 ; w) to be\nw(\u03b2(z1 , z2 ; w)) \u2212 w(z1 ) \u2212 w(z2 ) + 1.\nIn case the basic differential is zero the gap is defined to be \u221e.\n\nIf we take x, y to be the generators of the coordinate ring, then we will show in the next Lemma\n5.3 that the gap of \u03b2(x, y; v) is completely determined by the NP expansion associated with\nx, y. We shall say that the pair (x, y) has a maximal gap if for all automorphisms \u03c3 of A\nsuch that v(\u03c3(x)) = v(x), v(\u03c3(y)) = v(y), the gap of the basic differential \u03b2(\u03c3(x), \u03c3(y); v) is at\nmost equal to the gap of \u03b2(x, y; v). Note that an infinite gap is clearly maximal.\nWe now prove an auxiliary Lemma.\nLemma 5.3 Suppose that f \u2208 A has one place at infinity and an NP expansion\nx = \u03c4 \u2212n , y = \u03b7(\u03c4 ) = \u03c4 \u2212m + 0\nLet v denote the associated valuation at infinity.\n13\n\n\u03c4 \u2212m+q + higher terms.\n\n\fAssume that (n, m) is non principal, i.e. neither divides the other.\nThen the gap of \u03b2(x, y; v) is exactly q.\nSuppose that the pair (x, y) has a maximal gap as defined above.\nThen we have the following:\n1. \u2212m + q is not a multiple of n.\n2. \u2212n + q is not a multiple of m.\n3. An equation \u2212m \u2212 n + q = \u2212an \u2212 bm does not hold for non negative integers a, b.\nProof. The calculation of the gap of the basic differential is straightforward substitution. It\nfollows that the value of q does not change by interchanging the role of x, y.\nThe proofs are by contradiction. We show that when the desired conditions on q fail, we can\nmake an automorphism \u03c3 on x, y so that the gap of the basic differential \u03b2(\u03c3(x), \u03c3(y); v) is\nbigger than q but v(\u03c3(x)) = v(x) and v(\u03c3(y)) = v(y). This would give a contradiction.\nConsider the first case and suppose is possible \u2212m + q = \u2212ln. First, we claim that l \u2265 0, for\notherwise, we have a contradiction by Lemma 4.3. Now consider new variables X \u2032 = X, Y \u2032 =\nY + uX l where u \u2208 k. Let x\u2032 , y \u2032 be their respective images modulo f and note that:\nv(x) = v(x\u2032 ) , v(y) = v(y \u2032) , \u03b2(x\u2032 , y \u2032; v) = \u03b2(x, y, v) + (v(x)l \u2212 v(y))uxldx.\n\nIt is easy to verify that the leading term of \u03b2(x\u2032 , y \u2032; v) is (0 + 0 u)\u03c4 \u2212ln\u2212n\u22121d\u03c4 and so by\nchoosing u \u2208 k to kill this term we can make its order bigger than \u2212ln\u2212n\u22121 = \u2212m\u2212n+ q \u22121.\nIt follows that the gap gets bigger than q. This is a contradiction to the assumed maximality\nof q.\nThe second case has a similar argument.\nNow in the third case, we already know that if \u2212m \u2212 n + q = \u2212an \u2212 bm then both a, b are non\nzero. it follows that the right hand side is less than or equal to \u2212n \u2212 m giving q \u2264 0. Since\nq > 0 we have a contradiction!\nCorollary 5.4 Suppose that f \u2208 A has one place at infinity and an NP expansion\nx = \u03c4 \u2212n , y = \u03b7(\u03c4 ) = \u03c4 \u2212m + 0\n\n\u03c4 \u2212m+q + higher terms.\n\nFurther assume that (n, m) is non principal.\nLet v denote the associated valuation at infinity. Then there is an automorphism \u03c3 of A such\nthat v(\u03c3(x)) = v(x), v(\u03c3(y)) = v(y) and the pair (\u03c3(x), \u03c3(y)) has a maximal gap as defined\nabove.\nFurther, the automorphism \u03c3 is \"very elementary\" which means that it is either of the form\n\u03c3(X) = 0 X, \u03c3(Y ) = 0 Y + l(X) or of the form \u03c3(X) = 0 X + l(Y ), \u03c3(Y ) = 0 Y with\nl(X) \u2208 k[X].\n14\n\n\fProof. From known structure of automorphisms of curves with one place at infinity as in [AM3]\nand [ASI], we see that automorphisms which preserve that v-values of x, y are necessarily very\nelementary.\nConsidering how the equation f (X, Y ) is related to the NP expansion, we see that either q = \u221e\nand we have the desired maximal gap or q is bounded above by mn \u2212 1.\n\nThe proof of Lemma 5.3 shows that the gap of the basic differential \u03b2(x, y; v) is precisely q and\nsince this is bounded above there is a clear maximum value for this q under all possible very\nelementary automorphisms.\nWe simply choose an automorphism which gives such a maximal value.\nWe now prove:\nTheorem 5.5 Generalized Theorem of Zariski. Let f \u2208 A be a curve with one place at\ninfinity. Then \u03bc(f ; A) = \u03bd(f ) if and only if there is an automorphism \u03c3 : A \u2212\u2192 A such that\nf = \u03c3(Y )b \u2212 \u03c3(X)a for non negative integers a, b. Moreover, in view of irreducibility of f , we\nmust have GCD(a, b) = 1.\nProof. It is easy to check that when f has the indicated form \u03c3(Y )b \u2212 \u03c3(X)a , we have\n\u03bc(f ; A) = l(A/(\u03c3(X)a\u22121 , \u03c3(Y )b\u22121 )A = (a \u2212 1)(b \u2212 1) = \u03bd(f ).\nAll the remaining properties of f are easy to verify.\nNow for the only if part, we note that Proposition 5.2 already gives that f is a rational unibranch\ncurve with \u03b4(f ) = 0 and that all differentials in \u03a9(R, k) are exact. We use this to prove the\nexistence of the automorphism.\nWe can write after an adjustment of coordinates:\nf (X, Y ) = Y n \u2212 X m +\n\nX\n\nfij X i Y j\n\nwhere n > m and the terms of the summation are naturally restricted by the condition that f\nhas one place at infinity.\nIf m = 0, then we have y \u2208 k and after a translation in Y we get f = Y . This is the case when\na = 1, b = 0.\nNow assume that n > m > 0 such that (n, m) is non principal, i.e. neither divides the other.\nThis assumption is standard and ensured by performing elementary automorphisms on X, Y if\none of n, m divides the other.\nWe shall now assume the notations and details about the Abhyankar-Moh theory in Section 4\nwithout further explanation.\nIn particular, r0 = \u2212n, r1 = \u2212m, d1 = n, d2 = GCD(m, n) > 1 and by our arrangement\nn > m > d2 .\n15\n\n\fLet an NP expansion be written as:\nx = \u03c4 \u2212n , y = \u03b7(\u03c4 ) = \u03c4 \u2212m + higher terms\nand let v denote the corresponding valuation at infinity.\nIf there are no higher terms, then we have y n = xm and clearly f = Y n \u2212 X m . By irreducibility\nof f we get GCD(m, n) = 1 finishing the proof.\nSo, now assume that:\nx = \u03c4 \u2212n , y = \u03b7(\u03c4 ) = \u03c4 \u2212m + 0\n\n\u03c4 \u2212m+q + higher terms\n\nAs in Corollary 5.4, we assume that the gap q of the basic differential \u03b2(x, y; v) can be chosen\nto be maximal so that we can assume that the conditions established in Lemma 5.3 hold.\nBy exactness of all differentials in \u03a9(R, k), we deduce that \u2212m \u2212 n + q \u2208 \u0393(f ).\nWe have two possible cases and we show that both fail.\n\n1. Case 1: \u2212m + q is the second characteristic exponent, i.e. q = q2 . Since r2 = n1 r1 + q2 ,\nwe have\n\u2212m \u2212 n + q = r0 + r1 + r2 \u2212 n1 r1 = r0 + r1 + r2 \u2212 n0 r0 = (1 \u2212 n0 )r0 + r1 + r2 .\nThis is an admissible expression and hence is in \u0393(f ) if and only if 1 \u2212 n0 \u2265 0. Further,\nthis is possible only if n0 = 1, i.e. r0 = \u2212n divides r1 = \u2212m. This is a contradiction.\n2. Case 2: \u2212m + q is not a characteristic term, so \u2212m + q and hence \u2212m \u2212 n + q is divisible\nby d2 and we have \u2212m \u2212 n + q = a0 r0 + a1 r1 where 0 \u2264 a1 < n1 and 0 \u2264 a0 .\nThus \u2212m \u2212 n + q = \u2212a0 n \u2212 a1 m in contradiction with condition 3 of Lemma 5.3.\n\n6\n\nLink with Lin-Zaidenberg Theorem\n\nLet f \u2208 A be an irreducible polynomial. In [LZ], Lin and Zaidenberg proved the following:\nTheorem 6.1 Lin-Zaidenberg If f is a rational curve with one place at infinity which is\nlocally unibranch at all its points then there is an automorphism \u03c3 : A \u2212\u2192 A such that f =\n\u03c3(Y )b \u2212 \u03c3(X)a for non negative integers a, b. Moreover, in view of irreducibility of f , we must\nhave GCD(a, b) = 1.\nMoreover, the hypothesis of the theorem can be alternatively stated as: f \u2208 A is a curve with\none place at infinity such that \u03bc(f ; A) = \u03bc(f ).\nTheir results generalized the celebrated Abhyankar-Moh Epimorphism Theorem which can be\nstated as follows:\n16\n\n\fTheorem 6.2 Abhyankar-Moh If f is a rational nonsingular curve with one place at infinity\nthen there is an automorphism \u03c3 : A \u2212\u2192 A such that f = \u03c3(Y ).\nRemark 6.3 Note that the hypothesis of the Lin-Zaidenberg Theorem implies in our notation:\nPg (f ) = 0 = \u03c7(f ). Then, in view of sections 4.5, 4.6 we have\n\u03bc(f ; A) = C(f ) = \u03bc(f ) = \u03bd(f ) + \u03b4(f ).\nIn turn, the alternate hypothesis \u03bc(f ; A) = \u03bc(f ) is easily seen to imply all their conditions as\nin our proof of Corollary 4.2.\nThe Epimorphism Theorem is a special case in view of the facts that \u03bc(f ) = 0 by the non\nsingularity of the curve while the formula in 4.6 gives: \u03bc(f ; A) = \u2212C(\u0393(f )) = 0. Thus it\nis now a special case of the Lin-Zaidenberg Theorem. We note that, since the proofs of the\nLin-Zaidenberg theorem do use the Epimorphism Theorem, they do not provide an alternative\nproof for it.\nIt follows from the conclusion of the Lin-Zaidenberg theorem that further, \u03b4(f ) = 0. All known\nproofs of the Lin-Zaidenberg theorem are rather involved, using respectively complex analysis (Lin and Zaidenberg [LZ]), topology (Neumann and Rudolph [NR]), and finally algebraic\ngeometry using surface theory (Gurjar and Miyanishi [GM]).\nOur original aim was to provide a much simpler proof of this important theorem using the\ntechniques of the Abhyankar-Moh theory.\nOur theorem is a weaker version of the Lin-Zaidenberg theorem since we additionally need to\nassume that \u03b4(f ) = 0 and this is clearly the condition\nthat Jf = Jacf or f \u2208 Jf . The Linp\nZaidenberg hypothesis easily implies that f \u2208 Jf and the Lin-Zaidenberg theorem implies\nthat f \u2208 Jf . We have not yet succeeded in establishing this independently using our simpler\ntechniques. This condition can be also described as the condition of local quasihomogeneity\nexplained earlier in Remark 3.5.\n\n7\n\nEstimating independent non exact differentials\n\n7.1\n\nPreamble\n\nLet f \u2208 A be a rational curve with one place at infinity. We know from Proposition 4.1 and\nLemma 3.4 that for such a curve C(f ) = \u2212C(\u0393(f )) and C(f )/2 \u2212 Z(f ) = \u03b4(f ) + \u03c7(f ) measures\nhow far the curve fails to be quasihomogeneous. Also the quantity C(f )/2 \u2212 Z(f ) is seen to be\nthe number of independent non exact differentials by calculations of Lemma 5.1. 3\nIn this section we establish some estimates of this quantity.\n3\n\n\u2032\n\nIn the notation of the Lemma 5.1 this is the cardinality of the difference \u0393\u2217 (f ) \\ \u0393 (f ).\n\n17\n\n\fIn the above notation we assume: f \u2208 A is a rational curve with one place at infinity with NP\nexpansion\nX = \u03c4 \u2212n , Y = \u03c4 \u2212m + 0 \u03c4 \u2212m+q + * * *\n\nand let v as usual denote the resulting valuation. Note that we are implicitly assuming that\nq 6= \u221e, in other words, our curve is not globally quasihomogeneous.\nWe further assume that n > m > GCD(n, m) and the gap q is chosen to be as large as possible\nfor the given coprime degrees.\n\nWe already know that the basic differential \u2206 = \u03b2(x, y; v) associated with x, y is not exact in\nview of our proof of Theorem 5.5.\nWe investigate the set of non exact differentials which are multiples of this \u2206.\nBy the two cases analyzed in the proof of our Theorem 5.5, we see that we have:\n1. Case 1:\n\u2212m + q = \u2212m + q2 the second characteristic number and \u2212m \u2212 n + q =\n(1 \u2212 n0 )r0 + r1 + r2 6\u2208 \u0393(f ) since n0 > 1.\n2. Case 2: \u2212m + q is not a characteristic term and hence \u2212m \u2212 n + q = a0 r0 + a1 r1 where\n0 \u2264 a1 < n1 and a0 < 0.\n\n7.2\n\nNumber of distinct values of inexact differentials\n\nWe now prove\nLemma 7.1 Assume\nQ the setup of the preamble above and assume that we have case 1. Let wb\nbe any monomial gibi where b = (b0 , * * * , bh ) is an admissible sequence satisfying\n0 \u2264 b0 < n0 \u2212 1, 0 \u2264 b1 < n1 \u2212 1, 0 \u2264 b2 < n2 \u2212 1, 0 \u2264 bi < ni for 3 \u2264 i \u2264 h.\nThen the differentials {wb\u2206} are inexact members of \u03a9(R,\nQk) with distinct values. In particular,\nthe number of these is at least (n0 \u2212 1)(n1 \u2212 1)(n2 \u2212 1) h3 ni \u2265 2h\u22121 .\nProof. The differentials are inexact because their values augmented by 1 are not in \u0393(f ) as\nevident from their standard representation and it also gives the distinctness of the values. The\nestimate on the count is simply by counting the possible values of b's. For the last estimate\nnote that each ni is at least 2. Moreover the first two n0 , n1 are coprime to each other and\nhence at least one of them is 3 or bigger. This gives that at least h \u2212 1 of the h + 1 factors are\nat least 2 and finishes the proof.\nLemma 7.2 Assume\nQ bithe setup of the preamble above and assume that we have case 2. Let wb\nbe any monomial gi where b = (b0 , * * * , bh ) is an admissible sequence satisfying\n0 \u2264 b0 < \u2212a0 , 0 \u2264 b1 < n1 \u2212 a1 , 0 \u2264 bi < ni for 2 \u2264 i \u2264 h.\n18\n\n\fThen the differentials {wb\u2206} are inexact members\nk) with distinct values. In particular,\nQh of \u03a9(R,\nh\u22121\nthe number of these is at least (\u2212a0 )(n1 \u2212 a1 ) 2 ni \u2265 2 .\nProof. Everything except the last statement follows exactly as in Lemma 7.1.\nThe last estimate follows from the fact that each ni is at least 2 and we have h \u2212 1 terms\nn2 , * * * , nh as factors of our estimate.\n\nWe now investigate the case when the number of values of inexact differentials is exactly 1. We\nprove:\n\nProposition 7.3 Suppose that f \u2208 A is a curve with one place at infinity such that \u03bc(f ; A) =\n\u03bd(f ) + 1. Then we have the following:\n1. f is a rational curve with \u03b4(f ) = 0 and \u03c7(f ) = 1.\n2. There is exactly one value of an inexact differential in \u03a9(R, k).\n3. All such curves have h = 1 or equivalently n, m are coprime. Moreover, we have exactly\none of the following three situations:\n\u2022 Situation 1: m = 2, n = 2p + 1 for some p = 1, 2, * * * .\n\n\u2022 Situation 2: m = 3, n = 4.\n\n\u2022 Situation 3: m = 3, n = 5.\n\nEach of the these situations will be explicitly described below.\nProof. From the given condition we deduce from Proposition 4.1 that\n\u03b4(f ) + \u03c7(f ) + 2Pg (f ) = 1.\nIt follows that Pg = 0, i.e. the curve is rational. If \u03c7(f ) = 0, then we could apply the LinZaidenberg Theorem 6.1 and deduce that \u03b4(f ) = 0 giving a contradiction. This gives the first\npart.\nThe second part follows from Lemma 3.4.\n\u00bfFrom the lower bound 2h\u22121 in Lemma 7.1, 7.2 we deduce that h = 1. Further, this means that\nwe can apply the setup of Lemma 7.2 and in the notation of the preamble we get that\nGCD(m, n) = 1, a0 = \u22121, a1 = n1 \u2212 1 = n \u2212 1 and \u2212 m \u2212 n + q = (\u22121)(\u2212n) + (n \u2212 1)(\u2212m).\nBy adding 4 to both sides and rearranging, the last equation reduces to\nnm \u2212 2n \u2212 2m + 4 = (n \u2212 2)(m \u2212 2) = 4 \u2212 q\n19\n\n\fSince n > m by the preamble, we see that m = 2, 3, since otherwise 4 < (n\u22122)(m\u22122) = 4\u2212q < 4\nis a contradiction.\nIf m = 2 then we get q = 4 and n = 2p + 1 for some p = 1, 2, * * * since it is coprime with m.\n\nIf m = 3, then n = 4, q = 2 and n = 5, q = 1 give the only possibilities, since n > 5 leads to\n4 \u2264 (n \u2212 2)(m \u2212 2) = 4 \u2212 q < 4 a contradiction again!\nWe shall now give the explicit description of each of these cases below in separate Lemmas.\n\nLemma 7.4 Assume that we have Situation 1 as described in Proposition 7.3. Then by an\nautomorphism we can arrange that f = g(Y ) \u2212 X 2 where g(Y ) \u2208 k[Y ] is monic of degree 2p + 1\nand has exactly two distinct linear factors. In turn, every such curve satisfies the hypothesis of\nProposition 7.3.\nProof. Since m = 2 we know that f is of degree 2 in X and has a non zero constant coefficient\nfor X 2 . Thus the form of f can easily be arranged by translating X by a polynomial in Y to\nkill the X-term. Now let s be the number of distinct linear factors of g(Y ). We see:\nJacf = (f, fY , fX )A = (f, g \u2032(Y ), \u22122X)A = (X, g(Y ), g \u2032(Y ))A.\nIt is not hard to see that the length of the last ideal is \u03bd(f ) = 2p + 1 \u2212 s and since this is\nrequired to be \u03bc(f ; A) \u2212 1 = 2p \u2212 1 we get that s = 2. In turn, this also shows that all such\ncurves satisfy the hypothesis of Proposition 7.3.\nLemma 7.5 Assume that we have Situation 2 as described in Proposition 7.3. Then we can\narrange the parametric form of the curve as\n\u2022 either x = t4 + at2 , y = t3 \u2212 3t2 , a = 0, \u22128, \u22129 in case there is at least one singular\n(cuspidal) branch at finite distance\n\u2022 or x = (t2 \u2212 1)(t2 + a), y = (t2 \u2212 1)(t + b), where a = \u22121 and b 6= \u00b11 in case there is no\nsingular branch.\nProof. The proof is done by using Maple and we will only outline the strategy.\n\n4\n\nFirst, we assume that the singular branch is at t = 0 and then we can easily assume that either\ny = t3 or y = t3 + 0 t.\nIn the first case, we have x = t4 + 0\n\nt2 and a detailed calculation leads to impossible subcases.\n\nIn the second case, by a suitable scaling we may arrange y = t3 \u2212 3t2 .\n\nBy singularity of the branch, x has order at least 2 and we can remove its cubic term by adding\na multiple of y.\n4\n\nA Maple file with actual calculations will be provided if needed.\n\n20\n\n\fWe next calculate the Taylor Resultant (TRES) introduced by Abhyankar and described thus:\nGiven a parametric curve x = u(t), y = v(t) the branches at the singular points are determined\nby calculating the\nT RES(u(t), v(t)) = Resultant(\n\nu(t) \u2212 u(s) v(t) \u2212 v(s)\n,\n, s).\nt\u2212s\nt\u2212s\n\nThis resultant has precisely the degree equal to C(f ) and the multiplicities of its factors give\nthe exact order of the conductor ideal at various branches i.e. valuations. Indeed, for a rational\none place curve, it gives the exact generator of the conductor ideal Cf in the ring k[t].\nUnder our hypothesis of \u03c7(f ) = 1, we see that this TRES has degree 6 and has at most two\nsimple roots and thus a maximum of 4 distinct roots. Systematic use of the discriminant lets\nus determine the conditions on the coefficients (a, b) leading to the announced values.\nFor the case when we don't have a singular (cuspidal) branch, we assume that two branches\n(which can be arranged without loss of generality to be ) t = \u00b11 are centered at a singular point\narranged to be the origin. We then get the announced parametrization after killing out the\ncubic term by adding a multiple of y to x. We now note that there cannot be another singular\npoint, for it necessarily will be unibranch and will give a singular branch reducing to the first\ncase. Also, at the origin, we must have just the two branches and three nodes in successive\nneighborhoods. Calculations with usual quadratic transformations give the announced result.\nLemma 7.6 Assume that we have Situation 3 as described in Proposition 7.3. Then we can\narrange the parametric form of the curve as\n\u2022 either there is at least one singular (cuspidal) branch at finite distance and\nx = t5 + at4 + bt2 , y = (t3 \u2212 3t2 )\nwhere the values of (a, b) come from the finite set:\n{(\u221215, 0), (\u22123, 0)(\u22125/2, 0), (\u22123/2, 0), (\u22123, 4), (\u22126, 27), (\u22127, 36), (\u221215/2, 40)};\n\u2022 or there is at least one singular (cuspidal) branch at finite distance and\nx = t5 + as4 + bs2 , q = s3 with b = 0, a 6= 0;\n\u2022 or\n\nx = (t2 \u2212 1)(t3 \u00b1\n\n\u221a\n\n2t2 + 1), y = (t2 \u2212 1)(t + 1 \u00b1\n\nin case there is no singular branch.\n\n21\n\n\u221a\n\n2)\n\n\fProof. The arguments here are similar to Lemma 7.5, except we get an extra variable in each\ncase.\nIn case of at least one singular branch, we argue as before and both the subcases now lead to\nindicated solutions.\nIn case there is no singular branch, we again make a similar argument and end up with only\na finite set of solutions as indicated. Note that in this case, we need four successive nodes at\nthe origin (instead of the three nodes in Lemma 7.5) and hence the loss of a free parameter is\nexpected, so we end up with only a finite set of solutions.\nThe reduction in the first case is identical and the argument in the second case that the origin\nmust be the only singular point still holds, except we need to find four nodes in successive\nneighborhoods.\nRemark 7.7 It seems difficult to generalize the characterization above to one place rational\ncurves with small \u03bc(f ; A) \u2212 \u03bd(f ), for example, if \u03bc(f ; A) \u2212 \u03bd(f ) = 2, then Lemma 7.1. and\nLemma 7.2. show that h = 1 or 2. Every case contains many subcases. This makes the (already\ntechnical) work hard to realize.\n\n22\n\n\fReferences\n[A1] Abhyankar, S.
