LEE AND CHRISTINA SORMANI\nAbstract. This article is the sequel to [16], which dealt with the near-equality\ncase of the Positive Mass Theorem. We study the near-equality case of the Penrose Inequality for the class of complete asymptotically flat rotationally symmetric Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature whose boundaries\nare outermost minimal hypersurfaces. Specifically, we prove that if the Penrose\nInequality is sufficiently close to being an equality on one of these manifolds,\nthen it must be close to a Schwarzschild space with an appended cylinder, in the\nsense of Lipschitz Distance. Since the Lipschitz Distance bounds the Intrinsic\nFlat Distance on compact sets, we also obtain a result for Intrinsic Flat Distance,\nwhich is a more appropriate distance for more general near-equality results, as\ndiscussed in [16].\n\n1. Introduction\nThe (Riemannian) Penrose Inequality states that if (M n , g) is a complete asymptotically flat manifold of nonnegative scalar curvature whose boundary is an outermost minimal hypersurface, then the ADM mass of (M, g) satisfies\n! n\u22122\n1 |\u2202M| n\u22121\n(1)\nmADM \u2265\n,\n2 \u03c9n\u22121\nwhere |\u2202M| denotes the (hyper-)area of \u2202M, and \u03c9n\u22121 is the (hyper-)area of the\nstandard (n \u2212 1)-sphere in Rn . Furthermore, if equality holds, then (M, g) must\nbe isometric to a Riemannian Schwarzschild manifold (or more precisely, the part\nlying outside its outermost minimal hypersurface). The second statement may be\nthought of as a rigidity theorem, and it is natural to consider the stability of this\nrigidity statement. That is, if the ratio of the two sides of the inequality is close to\none, then in what sense can we say that the manifold is \"close\" to a Schwarzschild\nmanifold?\nThe ADM mass was defined by Arnowitt-Deser-Misner in [2]. The Penrose\nInequality is a refinement of the Positive Mass Theorem, which was proven by R.\nSchoen and S.-T. Yau in dimensions less than eight [17, 18], and by Witten for\nspin manifolds [20, 3]. The 3-dimensional Penrose Inequality was first proven by\nG. Huisken and T. Ilmanen [13] (where |\u2202M| must be replaced by the area of the\nlargest component of \u2202M), and later proven in full by H.

LEE AND CHRISTINA SORMANI\n\nmethod [6]. Bray and the first author extended Bray's proof to spin manifolds of\ndimension less than eight [7].\nThe problem of stability for the Positive Mass Theorem has been studied by the\nfirst author in [15], by F. Finster with Bray and I. Kath in [5, 10, 9], and by J.\nCorvino in [8]. Since the general problem of stability is a difficult one, we considered the special case of rotational symmetry (that is, SO(n) symmetry), and in that\ncase the authors were able to prove a comprehensive stability result [16]. Although\nthere is no Lipschitz stability in that setting (in the sense of Lipschitz Distance\ndefined below), we formulated the stability in terms of Intrinsic Flat Distance, a\nnotion defined by the second author and S. Wenger in [19]. This article is a natural\nextension of that investigation to the problem of stability for the Penrose Inequality.\nWe find that stability fails for the Penrose Inequality in the sense that manifolds with almost equality in the Penrose Inequality are not necessarily close to\nSchwarzschild space in any reasonable topology. Specifically, they may instead\nbe close to Schwarzschild spaces with a cylinder of arbitrary length appended to\nthe boundary. See Example 5.2 depicted in Figure 1 below. This behavior is to be\nexpected because the rigidity in the Penrose Inequality only applies to manifolds\nwhose boundaries are outermost minimal hypersurfaces. Since this class of Riemannian manifolds is not closed in any reasonable topology, one does not expect a\ntrue stability result. Before we state our result, we provide a few definitions.\nDefinition 1.1. Given n \u2265 3, let RotSym\u2202n be the class of complete n-dimensional\nrotationally symmetric (that is, SO(n) symmetry) smooth complete Riemannian\nmanifolds of nonnegative scalar curvature whose connected nonempty boundaries\nare outermost (and outer-minimizing) minimal hypersurfaces.\nThe class RotSym\u2202n includes the Schwarzschild spaces. The nonnegative scalar\ncurvature condition corresponds to the physical assumption of nonnegative mass\ndensity in the time-symmetric setting. The outermost condition is included here,\njust as it is in the Penrose Inequality, because complicated geometry can \"hide\"\nbehind a minimal hypersurface without affecting the ADM mass, cf. [11, 13]). The\noutermost minimal boundary is often called an apparent horizon. Note that we\nneed not explicitly assume asymptotic flatness here because finite ADM mass in\nRotSym\u2202n implies asymptotic flatness.\nRecall the Lipschitz Distance between metric spaces as defined in [12]:\nDefinition 1.2. Given two metric spaces (X, dX ) and (Y, dY ), the Lipschitz Distance\nn\no\n(2) dL (X, Y) := inf | log dil(\u03c6)| + | log dil(\u03c6\u22121 )| : \u03c6 : X \u2212\u2192 Y is bi-Lipschitz\nwhere\n(3)\n\ndil(\u03c6) = sup\nxi \u2208X\n\ndY (\u03c6(x1 ), \u03c6(x2 ))\n.\ndX (x1 , x2 )\n\nn (m) to be the part of the n-dimensional\nDefinition 1.3. For any m > 0, define MSch\nSchwarzschild space of mass m that lies outside its outermost minimal hypersurn (m, L) to be M n (m) with the cylinder\nface. For any L \u2208 [0, \u221e), define MSch\nSch\n1\n[\u2212L, 0] \u00d7 S n\u22121 ((2m) n\u22122 ) glued to its outermost minimal hypersurface boundary,\n\n\fNEAR-EQUALITY OF PENROSE\n\n3\n\n1\n\nn (m) denotes the standard (n \u2212 1)-sphere of radius\nwhere S n\u22121 ((2m) n\u22122 ) \u001b \u2202MSch\n1\n(2m) n\u22122 .\n\nTheorem 1.4. Let n \u2265 3. For any \u000f > 0, there exists \u03b4 > 0 such that if M \u2208\nRotSym\u2202n satisfies\n! n\u22122\n1 + \u03b4 |\u2202M| n\u22121\n,\n(4)\nmADM \u2264\n2\n\u03c9n\u22121\nthen\n\u0010\n\u0011\nn\n(5)\ndL M, MSch\n(m0 , L) < \u000f,\n\u0010\n\u0011 n\u22122\nn\u22121\nwhere m0 = 12 \u03c9|\u2202M|\n, and L is the depth of M, as defined in Section 3.1.\nn\u22121\nIn other words, if the ratio of the two sides of the Penrose Inequality is close\nenough to one, then the space must be close to an appended Schwarzschild space\nin Lipschitz Distance. See Theorem 3.4 for a more precise statement implicitly\ndescribing the dependence of \u03b4 on \u000f.\nAs alluded to above, the reason why we need the appended Schwarzschild\nspaces is that we may have a sequence of manifolds in RotSym\u2202n whose limit has\na boundary that is not outermost. This situation is described in Example 5.2 and\ndepicted in Figure 1 below. Example 5.4 demonstrates that one cannot improve the\nLipschitz convergence to C 2 convergence.\n\nFigure 1. Sequences approaching various limits, MSch (m, L).\nNote that Theorem 1.4 does not hold without the assumption of rotational symmetry, as seen in Example 5.5. The basic reason why we obtain such a strong\nresult in Theorem 1.4 is that rotational symmetry combined with the existence of a\n\n\f4\n\nDAN A. LEE AND CHRISTINA SORMANI\n\nboundary of fixed size rules out the possibility of a thin, deep gravity well. These\ndeep gravity wells are the reason why neither Lipschitz Distance nor even GromovHausdorff Distance provide a useful topology for a more general theorem. This is\ndiscussed in our earlier work [16], in which we propose Intrinsic Flat Distance as\nan appropriate topology.\nThe Intrinsic Flat Distance was defined by the second author and S. Wenger in\n[19] based upon work of L. Ambrosio and B. Kirchheim [1]. It estimates the distances between compact Riemannian n-manifolds by filling in (in the sense of metric space isometric embeddings) the space between them with a countably H n+1\nrectifiable metric space and measuring the H n+1 measure of the filling space and\nthe H n measure of any excess boundary. It was proven in [19] that the Intrinsic\nFlat Distance between two Riemannian manifolds with boundary can be bounded\nin terms of the Lipschitz Distance between them, their diameters, their volumes and\nthe (hyper-)areas of their boundaries. In recent of work of the second author and S.\nLakzian, an explicit filling manifold is constructed between two spaces which are\nclose in the Lipschitz sense [14]. See Section 4.1 for the precise statement. Using\nthis bound we conclude the following:\nTheorem 1.5. Let n \u2265 3, and let 0 < A0 < A1 . For any D > 0 and \u000f > 0, there\nexists \u03b4 > 0 such that if M \u2208 RotSym\u2202n satisfies |\u2202M| = A0 and\n! n\u22122\n1 + \u03b4 A0 n\u22121\n,\n(6)\nmADM \u2264\n2\n\u03c9n\u22121\nthen\n\u0011\n\u0010\nn\ndF T D (\u03a31 ) \u2282 M, T D (\u03a3\u03041 ) \u2282 MSch\n(m0 , L) < \u000f,\nn\u22122\n\u0011 n\u22121\n\u0010\nwhere m0 = 12 \u03c9|\u2202M|\n, L is the depth of M, \u03a31 and \u03a3\u0304 are the respective symmetric\nn\u22121\nspheres of area A1 in M and MSch (m0 , L), T D denotes the tubular neighborhood of\nradius D, and dF denotes Intrinsic Flat Distance.\n(7)\n\nFor more discussion of Intrinsic Flat Distance and its application to the study of\nnonnegative scalar curvature, see [16]. Note that a scale-invariant version of this\nresult would require a scalable version of Intrinsic Flat Distance. This is being\ndeveloped by J. Basilio [4].\nIn the final section of the paper we provide examples and propose that some\nversion of Theorem 1.5 holds without the restriction of rotational symmetry.

Lipschitz Estimates\nIn this section we define the depth and prove all Lipschitz estimates needed to\nprove our main results.\n3.1. Depth. Let M \u2208 RotSym\u2202n . For convenience, we express the important quantities mADM and |\u2202M| in different units, defining\n! n\u22122\n1 |\u2202M| n\u22121\n(26)\n>0\nm0 :=\n2 \u03c9n\u22121\n! 1\n1\n|\u2202M| n\u22121\nr0 := r(0) = (2m0 ) n\u22122 =\n(27)\n>0\n\u03c9n\u22121\n(28)\n\n1\n\nr1 := (2mADM ) n\u22122 > 0.\n\nThese quantities will be applied to define the depth and again in subsequent proofs.\nDefine \u03b4 so that\n! n\u22122\n1 + \u03b4 |\u2202M| n\u22121\n,\n(29)\nmADM =\n2\n\u03c9n\u22121\nUsing the definitions above, we can rewrite this as\n(30)\n\nr1n\u22122 = (1 + \u03b4)r0n\u22122 .\n\nWe now define r\u03b4 and A\u03b4 so that\n\n\u221a 1\n\u03b4) n\u22122 r0\n\n(31)\n\nr\u03b4 := (1 +\n\n(32)\n\nA\u03b4 := \u03c9n\u22121 r\u03b4n\u22121 .\n\nRecall that MSch (m0 ) may be isometrically embedded into Rn+1 with its boundary embedded at the level z = 0 and radius r = r0 , as described in Section 2.3.\nWe can also isometrically embed M into Rn+1 via the function z(r) introduced in\nSection 2.2, and this embedding is defined only up to constant. Let us choose this\nconstant so that M intersects the standard embedding of MSch (m0 ) in Rn+1 at r = r\u03b4 .\nSee Figure 2 below.\nDefinition 3.1. We define the depth of M \u2208 RotSym\u2202n to be L such that when M is\nembedded into Rn+1 as described above and depicted in Figure 2, \u2202M embeds into\nr = r0 and z = \u2212L.\nRemark 3.2. We note that although the depth is an invariant of M \u2208 RotSym\u2202n\nwhich could plausibly be generalized to non-rotationally symmetric spaces, the\ndefinition is not quite natural in the sense that it depends on an arbitrary choice for\nwhat r\u03b4 should\n\u221a be. As one can see from the proof in the next section, if we were\nto replace \u03b4 by \u03b41/3 in the definition of depth, Theorem 1.4 would still hold true.\nNevertheless, the concept of depth may be worthy of further investigation.\nLemma 3.3. The depth L is always nonnegative.\n\n\f8\n\nDAN A. LEE AND CHRISTINA SORMANI\n\nFigure 2. The depth L and the bi-Lipschitz map \u03c6 are defined by\nembedding M and MSch (m0 ) into Rn+1 so that they intersect at\nr = r\u03b4 .\nProof. Consider the functions r(s) and z(r) as defined for the manifold M. By\nGeroch monotonicity (15), we have\nmH (\u2202M) \u2264 mH (\u03a3) \u2264 mADM\n\n(33)\n\nfor any symmetric sphere \u03a3.

In particular, this means that \u2202M cannot lie above\n\u2202MSch (m0 ), so that \u2212L = z(r0 ) \u2264 0, as desired.\n\u0003\n\n\fNEAR-EQUALITY OF PENROSE\n\n9\n\n3.2. Proof of Theorem 1.4. Theorem 1.4 is an easy consequence of the following\ntheorem.\nTheorem 3.4. Let n \u2265 3, and let M \u2208 RotSym\u2202n . Define \u03b4 so that\n! n\u22122\n1 + \u03b4 |\u2202M| n\u22121\n,\n(39)\nmADM =\n2\n\u03c9n\u22121\n\u0010\n\u0011 n\u22122\n\u221a n\u22121\nn\u22121\nand assume 0 \u2264 \u03b4 < 1. Define m0 = 12 \u03c9|\u2202M|\n, A\u03b4 = (1 + \u03b4) n\u22122 |\u2202M|, and\nn\u22121\nlet L be depth of M. Then there exists a rotationally symmetric bi-Lipschitz map\n\u03c6 : M \u2192 MSch (m0 , L) that maps symmetric spheres of area A \u2265 A\u03b4 to symmetric\nspheres of area A such that for any tangent vector v \u2208 T M,\n(40)\n\nh\u22121\n\u03b4 \u2264\n\ng(v, v)\n\u2264 h\u03b4\ngSch,L (\u03c6\u2217 v, \u03c6\u2217 v)\n\nwhere\n(41)\n\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a 2\nh\u03b4 = max (1 + \u03b4) n\u22122 , (1 + \u03b4)(1 + \u03b4), (1 \u2212 \u03b4)\u22121 .\n\n\u221a\nTheorem 1.4 follows from this theorem because h\u03b4 is then a bound on Lip(\u03c6)\nand Lip(\u03c6\u22121 ), so that\np\n(42)\ndL (M, MSch (m0 , L)) \u2264 2 log h\u03b4 = log(h\u03b4 ),\nwhich converges to 0 as \u03b4 \u2192 0.\nProof. We will prove Theorem 3.4 by explicitly constructing the bi-Lipschitz map.\nLet (M, g), \u03b4, m0 , A\u03b4 , and L be as described in the statement of the theorem.\nWe define r0 , r1 , and r\u03b4 as in Section 3.1, and we isometrically embed M and\nMSch (m0 ) into Rn+1 as in Section 3.1. Then we embed MSch (m0 , L) so that \u2202M =\n\u2202MSch (m0 , L) and such that the Schwarzschild domain within MSch (m0 , L) agrees\nwith the embedding of MSch (m0 ). See Figure 2 above.\nWe define the bi-Lipschitz map \u03c6 : M \u2212\u2192 MSch (m0 , L) as follows. In the region\nwhere r \u2265 r\u03b4 , \u03c6 projects M vertically in Rn+1 to MSch (m0 , L). That is, under this\nmap, the two manifolds have the same r coordinates and sphere coordinates, but\ndifferent z coordinates. In particular \u03c6 preserves the areas of symmetric spheres\nof area A \u2265 A\u03b4 . In the region where r \u2264 r\u03b4 , \u03c6 projects M horizontally in Rn+1 to\nMSch (m0 , L). That is, under this map, the two manifolds have the z coordinates and\nsphere coordinates, but different r coordinates. The vertical and horizontal lines in\nFigure 2 depict the map \u03c6. Since the two definitions match up at r = r\u03b4 , this map\nis clearly bi-Lipschitz.\nWe now prove (40) for the region where r \u2265 r\u03b4 . Recall that in this region, \u03c6\npreserves both the r coordinate and the sphere coordiantes, so it suffices to assume\nv is purely radial. Note that the assumption that \u03b4 < 1 implies that r0 \u2264 r1 < r\u03b4 , so\nthat when r \u2265 r\u03b4 , (35) tells us that\n!2\n\u0012 r \u0013n\u22122\n\u0012 r \u0013n\u22122\ndr\n0\n1\n(43)\n1\u2212\n\u2265\n\u22651\u2212\n> 0.\nr\nds\nr\n\n\f10\n\nDAN A.

Since in this region,\n\u03c6 changes the r-coordinate, we must separately consider vectors that are tangent\nto the symmetric spheres, as well as ones that are orthogonal to the symmetric\nspheres. However, the image of a symmetric sphere in M with radius r0 \u2264 r \u2264 r\u03b4\nunder \u03c6 is another symmetric sphere with radius r0 \u2264 r \u2264 r\u03b4 .

Review of the Intrinsic Flat Distance. The Intrinsic Flat Distance measures\nthe distances between compact oriented Riemannian manifolds by filling in the\nspace between them. This notion was first defined in work of the second author\nand S. Wenger in [19] applying the theory of integral currents on metric spaces\ndeveloped by Ambrosio-Kirchheim in [1]. However, here we estimate the intrinsic\nflat distance using only an understanding of Riemannian geometry.\nGiven two compact oriented Riemannian manifolds M1n and M2n with boundary,\nand metric isometric embeddings \u03c8i : Mi \u2192 Z into some Riemannian manifold\n(possibly piecewise smooth with corners) an upper bound for the Intrinsic Flat\nDistance is attained as follows:\n(60)\n\ndF (M1n , M2n ) \u2264 Voln+1 (Bn+1 ) + Voln (An )\n\nwhere Bn+1 is an oriented region in Z and An is defined so that the oriented integrals\nsatisfy\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\n(61)\n\u03c9\u2212\n\u03c9=\n\u03c9+\n\u03c9\n\u03c81 (M1 )\n\n\u03c82 (M2 )\n\n\u2202B\n\nA\n\nfor any differential n-form \u03c9 on Z. We call Bn+1 a filling manifold between M1 and\nM2 and An the excess boundary.\nRecall that a metric isometric embedding, \u03c8 : M \u2192 Z is a map such that\n(62)\n\ndZ (\u03c8(x), \u03c8(y)) = d M (x, y)\n\n\u2200x, y \u2208 M.\n\nThis is significantly stronger than a Riemannian isometric embedding which preserves only the Riemannian structure and thus lengths of curves but not distances\nbetween points as in (62). For example, S 1 has a metric isometric embedding as\nthe equator of a hemisphere but only a Riemannian isometric embedding as a circle\nin a plane.\nTheorem 5.6 of [19] states that the Intrinsic Flat Distance between oriented Riemannian manifolds may be bounded as follows:\n!\nn + 1 n\u22121\n\u03bb (\u03bb \u2212 1) max{D1 , D2 }(V1 + A1 )\n(63)\ndF (M1 , M2 ) \u2264\n2\nwhere \u03bb = edL (M1 ,M2 ) , Di = diam(Mi ), Vi = Voln (Mi ) and Ai = Voln\u22121 (\u2202Mi ). This\nis proven using the theory of currents.\nIn work of the second author and S. Lakzian, the following more constructive\nstatement is proven using Riemannian geometry [14].

In the proof of this\ntheorem, the cosine term in (67) arises from a comparison to the equator isometrically embedded in a sphere of diameter Di .\nConstructive estimates on the Intrinsic Flat Distance are also provided in previous work of the authors studying the stability of the Positive Mass Theorem [16].\nIn that paper, no bi-Lipschitz maps are constructed. Instead metric isometric embeddings are created from Riemannian isometric embeddings using strips whose\nwidths are bounded by controlling the embedding constant.\n4.2. Intrinsic Flat Estimates.

Further Remarks\nIn the first subsection we explain why it is necessary to introduce a notion of\ndepth and use appended Schwarzschild manifolds in the statements of our main\ntheorems. We also explain why Theorem 1.4 cannot be strengthened to C 2 closeness of the metrics. In the second subsection, we consider the stability of the Positive Mass Theorem in [16] and contrast it with the situation for the Penrose Inequality. In the third subsection, we present Example 5.5 demonstrating the necessity of\nrotational symmetry to obtain the Lipschitz bounds in Theorem 1.4, followed by\nRemark 5.7 explaining heuristically why these examples may be controlled using\nthe Intrinsic Flat distance. We close with a subsection describing open problems\nand conjectures.\n5.1. Rotationally Symmetric Examples. First we describe the examples depicted\nin Figure 1. Recall from Section 2 that for rotationally symmetric manifolds with\noutermost minimal boundaries, monotonicity of the Hawking mass of the symmetric spheres is equivalent to nonnegativity of scalar curvature. Therefore, we have\nthe following lemma which will be useful for constructing examples:\nLemma 5.1. There is a bijection between elements of RotSym\u2202n and increasing\nfunctions mH : [r0 , \u221e) \u2192 R such that\n(77)\n\n1\nmH (r0 ) = r0n\u22122\n2\n\nand\n1\nmH (r) < rm\u22122\n2\nfor r > r0 . In this section we will call these functions admissible Hawking mass\nfunctions.\n(78)\n\nThis lemma was proven in [16].\n\n\fNEAR-EQUALITY OF PENROSE\n\n15\n\nExample 5.2. Let n \u2265 3. Given any 0 < A0 < A1 , and any large L > 0 and small\n\u03b4 > 0, there exists M \u2208 RotSym\u2202n with |\u2202M| = A0 such that\n! n\u22122\n1 + \u03b4 A0 n\u22121\n(79)\nmADM \u2264\n,\n2\n\u03c9n\u22121\nand also\n(80)\n\nd(\u2202M, \u03a31 ) > L,\n\nwhere \u03a31 is the symmetric sphere of area A1 .\nRemark 5.3.

To see that we can choose \u000f small\u221aenough to make this true, observe that by the\ndr\ndefinition of mH (13), we have ds\n= \u000f over the region r\u000f \u2264 r \u2264 r\u000f .

Note that this example can be modified in a\nstraightforward manner to obtain a smooth example.\n\u0003\n\n\f16\n\nDAN A. LEE AND CHRISTINA SORMANI\n\nThe next example proves that the Lipschitz convergence cannot be improved to\nC 2 convergence in Theorem 1.4.\nExample 5.4. There exists a sequence M j \u2208 RotSym\u2202n such that each |\u2202M j | = A0 ,\n! n\u22122\nA0 n\u22121\n(89)\nlim mADM (M j ) =\n,\nj\u2192\u221e\n\u03c9n\u22121\nand M j converges to MSch (m0 ) in the Lipschitz sense, but not in the C 2 sense, where\n\u0010\n\u0011 n\u22122\nn\u22121\n0\nm0 = \u03c9An\u22121\n.\nProof. Choose a sequence m j & m0 . For each j we construct an admissible Hawk( j)\n( j)\n( j)\ning function mH such that mH (r) = m0 for r \u2208 [r0 , 2r0 ], and then mH (r) takes a\n( j)\n\na very brief sharp turn upward so that\n\nmH\ndr\n\n>\n\n1\nj\n\nfor some r \u2208 (2r0 , 3r0 ), and then\n\n( j)\nmH\n\n= m j for r \u2208 [3r0 , \u221e). By our proof Theorem 1.4, the corresponding manifolds\nmust converge to MSch (m0 ) in the Lipschitz sense. (We know that the depths are\nzero, because each M j is exactly Schwarzschild in a fixed neighborhood of \u2202M j .)\nBut (13) tells us that\n( j)\n\n(90)\n\nmH\nrn\u22122\n=\nR,\ndr\n2\n\nand therefore R can be arbitrarily large as j \u2192 \u221e, so C 2 convergence is impossible.\n\u0003\n5.2. Contrasting with Positive Mass Stability. Theorem 1.5 is not a stability\nstatement, because the appended Schwarzschild space depends on the depth of M.\nIn particular, this means that if we have a sequence of manifolds M j with fixed\n|\u2202M j | whose \u03b4 j 's approach zero, the sequence need not converge to anything, since\ntheir depths need not converge (which is intuitively clear from 5.2). In this sense\nTheorem 1.5 is weaker than the Positive Mass Stability Theorem proven by the\nauthors in [16]. There we proved that if M \u2208 RotSym\u2202n has ADM mass close\nto zero, then tubular neighborhoods in M are close in the Intrinsic Flat sense to\ntubular neighborhoods in Euclidean space. In particular, a sequence M j whose\nmasses approach zero must converge to Euclidean space in the pointed Intrinsic\nFlat, with appropriately chosen basepoints.\nOn the other hand Theorem 1.4 is far stronger than the Positive Mass Stability\nTheorem in [16] in the sense that we are able to obtain Lipschitz estimates rather\nthan just Intrinsic Flat estimates. The reason one cannot obtain Lipschitz estimates\nfor the near-equality case of the Positive Mass Theorem is that there \u2202M can be\nboth arbitrarily small and arbitrarily deep. If we look at a limit of such examples\nwith masses approaching zero, we see that the deep regions are not becoming close\nto a cylinder but rather a line segment. There cannot be a bi-Lipschitz map from a\nregion of dimension \u2265 3, to a region of dimension 1. However, this interior region\ncan be controlled by constructing a filling manifold and estimating its volume,\nleading to a stability result formulated in terms of Intrinsic Flat Distance [16].\n\n\fNEAR-EQUALITY OF PENROSE\n\n17\n\nNote that in [16], it was possible to obtain a Lipschitz estimate away from the\nthin, deep well, which could have been proved in a manner similar to Section 3.\nSuch a proof could have been used as a step in proving the main results of [16],\nbut instead we chose a proof that emphasized features of Intrinsic Flat Distance\nwhich are better suited to more general problems. Even in the Penrose setting, the\nLipschitz estimate in Theorem 1.4 is special to the rotationally symmetric case, as\nseen below.\n5.3. Many Wells. In this subsection we present Example 5.5 demonstrating the\nnecessity of rotational symmetry in Theorem 1.4, followed by Remark 5.7 explaining heuristically why these example with many wells can be controlled with the\nIntrinsic Flat distance.\nExample 5.5. There exist sequences of Riemannian manifolds satisfying all the\nhypotheses of Theorem 1.4 except the rotational symmetry, with \u03b4 j \u2192 0, such that\nthe sequence does not become Lipschitz close (or even Gromov-Hausdorff close)\nto MSch (m0 , L) for any L.\nProof. One may construct a Riemannian manifold with many wells similar to the\nexample constructed in [16]. As in that example, one begins with a rotationally\nsymmetric manifold with thin regions of constant sectional curvature. The only\ndifference is that here we start with manifolds M 0j \u2208 RotSym\u2202n that have fixed\nboundary of (hyper-)area A0 and edit in thin strips of constant curvature while\nensuring that\n! n\u22122\n1 A0 n\u22121\n0\n.\n(91)\nmADM (M j ) \u2192 m0 =\n2 \u03c9n\u22121\nWe can do this in a way such that M 0j converge in the Lipschitz sense to some\nMSch (m0 ).\nNext we edit in rotationally symmetric wells of some fixed depth h > 0 replacing small balls in the strips of constant sectional curvature. We can edit in\narbitrarily many such wells just as in the example constructed in [16]. This creates\nnew manifolds M j which satisfy all the conditions of Theorem 1.4 except the rotational symmetry. As they have increasingly many wells of depth h, they have no\nGromov-Hausdorff limit and do not converge in the Lipschitz sense.\n\u0003\nRemark 5.6. Suppose that M n is asymptotically flat with positive scalar curvature\nand that \u2202M is outermost minimizing. Suppose further that M contains many rotationally symmetric wells, Wi , as in Example 5.5. If n < 8, the Penrose inequality\nguarantees that\nX\nn\u22121\nn\u22121\nn\u22121\n(92)\nmH (\u2202Wi ) n\u22122 \u2264 mADM (M) n\u22122 \u2212 mH (\u2202M) n\u22122\ni\n\nTo see this, replace each well Wi by a region of mSch (mH (Wi )) to create a new\nmanifold N, and then apply the Penrose inequality to N [7].\nRemark 5.7. Example 5.5 does not appear to contradict an extension of Theorem 1.5 to the setting where there is no rotational symmetry. One can imagine\n\n\f18\n\nDAN A. LEE AND CHRISTINA SORMANI\n\nconstructing fillings for each well and controlling the volume of each filling in\nterms of the Hawking mass at the top of each well using techniques similar to\nthose developed in [16].\n5.4. Conjectures. While Theorem 1.4 does not generalize, we hope that Theorem\n1.5 does. We propose a conjecture along the lines of what we conjectured for\nstability of the Positive Mass Theorem in [16].\nDefinition 5.8. Let M be a subclass of asymptotically flat three dimensional Riemannian manifolds of nonnegative scalar curvature, whose boundaries are outermost minimal surfaces.\nConjecture 5.9. Let 0 < A0 < A1 . For any D > 0 and \u000f > 0, there exists \u03b4 > 0\ndepending on these constants, such that for any M 3 \u2208 M satisfying\nr\nA0\n,\n(93)\nmADM \u2264 (1 + \u03b4)\n16\u03c0\nwhere A0 is the (hyper-)area of one connected component of \u2202M, then\n\u0010\n\u0011\nn\n(94)\ndF T D (\u03a31 ) \u2282 M, T D (\u03a3\u03041 ) \u2282 MSch\n(m0 , L) < \u000f,\nwhere \u03a31 is a special surface of area A1 , L is the depth of M, \u03a3\u03041 is the symmetric\n\u0011 n\u22122\n\u0010\nn\u22121\n0\nsphere of area A1 in MSch (m0 , L) and m0 = 21 \u03c9An\u22121\n.\nWe are deliberately vague as to how restrictive the class M needs to be. The\nconjecture may require uniform conditions at infinity. We have also been vague\nas to what the special surface, \u03a31 , should be. The main point about \u03a31 is that it\nshould avoid the wells and also not escape to infinity. Please see [16] for more\ndiscussion about how \u03a31 might be defined. We have also been vague as to what the\nappropriate definition of depth should be in the general setting.
