Introduction\nThanks to the precise experimental measurements [2] and the theoretical improvements [3], semileptonic (SL) decays of light quarks are a deep\nprobe of the nature of weak interactions [4, 5]. In particular, the precise determination of the elements Vud and Vus of the Cabibbo-KobayashiMaskawa (CKM) [6] matrix enables tests of the CKM unitarity condition1\n|Vud |2 + |Vus |2 + |Vub |2 = 1, at the level of 0.001 or better. Assuming that\n2 /\u039b2 ), this test probes energy scales \u039b on\nNP contributions scale as \u03b1/\u03c0(MW\nthe order of the TeV, which will be directly probed at the LHC.\nWhile the consequences of Cabibbo universality tests have been considered in some explicit Standard Model (SM) extensions [7], our goal is to\nstudy it in a model-independent way. We have to analyze the NP contributions to the muon decay (where the GF is extracted) and to the different\nchannels that are used to extract the product GF Vud,us . Currently the determinations of Vud and Vus are dominated by super-allowed nuclear beta\n\u2217\n\n1\n\nPresented at the FLAVIAnet topical workshop \"Low energy constraints on extensions\nof the Standard Model\" (Kazimierz, Poland), July 2009, based on [1].\nVub \u223c 10\u22123 contributes negligibly to this relation.\n\n(1)\n\n\f2\n\ndecays [8] (Vud = 0.97425(22)) and Kl3 decays [9] (Vus = 0.2252(9)) respectively, although experimental and theoretical improvements in other\nchannels can make them competitive in the near future.\n2. Weak scale effective lagrangian\nIn order to analyze in a model-independent framework NP contributions\nto both electroweak precision observables (EWPO) and beta decays we take\nthe SM (including the Higgs) as the low-energy limit of a more fundamental\ntheory, and more specifically we assume that: (i) there is a gap between\nthe weak scale v and the NP scale \u039b where new degrees of freedom appear;\n(ii) the NP at the weak scale is weakly coupled, so the electroweak (EW)\ngauge symmetry is linearly realized; (iii) the violation of total lepton and\nbaryon number is suppressed by a scale much higher than \u039b \u223c TeV. These\nassumptions lead us to an effective non-renormalizable lagrangian of the\nform [10]:\nL(eff) = LSM +\n\n1\n1\n1\nL5 + 2 L6 + 3 L7 + . . .\n\u039b\n\u039b\n\u039b\n\n(1)\n\nP (n) (n)\n(n)\nwhere Ln = i \u03b1i Oi , being Oi local gauge-invariant operators of dimension n built out of SM fields. It can be shown that under the above\nassumptions, there are no corrections to the SM lagrangian at dimension\nfive, whereas seventy-seven operators appear at dimension six [1, 10], where\nwe truncate the expansion. In order to be consistent with this truncation\nwe will work at linear order in the NP corrections.\nFor the EWPO and beta decays it can be shown that we only need a\ntwenty-five operator basis, with twenty-one U (3)5 invariant and four noninvariant2 (we will see the usefulness of this separation later). Only nine of\nthose operators will contribute to the beta and muon decays:\n(1)\n\n1 \u03bc\n(l\u03b3 l)(l\u03b3\u03bc l)\n2\n= (l\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c3 a l)(q\u03b3\u03bc \u03c3 a q),\n\nOll =\n(3)\n\nOlq\n\n1\n(3)\nOll = (l\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c3 a l)(l\u03b3\u03bc \u03c3 a l),\n2\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\n(3)\n\n(3)\n= i(\u03c6\u2020D \u03bc \u03c3 a\u03c6)(q\u03b3\u03bc \u03c3 aq) +h.c.,(4)\nO\u03c6l = i(h\u2020D \u03bc \u03c3 a\u03c6)(l\u03b3\u03bc \u03c3 a l) +h.c., O\u03c6q\n\nOqde = (le)(dq) + h.c.,\nOlq = ( \u0304la e)\u01ebab (q\u0304b u) + h.c.\n\n(5)\nt\nOlq\n\n= ( \u0304la \u03c3 e)\u01eb (q\u0304b \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd u) + h.c.

Flavor structure of the effective couplings\nSo far we have not made any assumption about the flavor structures in\nthe couplings [\u03b1\u0302X ]abcd . However flavor changing neutral current (FCNC)\nprocesses forbid generic structures if \u039b \u223c TeV and therefore we organize\nthe discussion in terms of perturbations around the U (3)5 flavor symmetry\nlimit, where no problem arises with FCNC.\nIn the U (3)5 -limit the expressions greatly simplify and all the NP effects\ncan be encoded into the following redefinitions\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(3)\n(3)\n,\n(17)\nG\u03bcF = (GF )(0) 1 + 4 \u03b1\u0302\u03c6l \u2212 2 \u03b1\u0302ll\n\u0011\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0010\n(3)\n(3)\n(0)\n,\n(18)\n1 + 2 \u03b1\u0302\u03c6l + \u03b1\u0302(3)\nGSL\n\u03c6q \u2212 \u03b1\u0302lq\nF = (GF )\n\n\u221a\n(0)\nwhere GF = g2 /(4 2m2W ).

This shift is independent of the channel used to extract Vud,us and the only way to expose NP contributions is\nto construct universality tests, in which the absolute normalization of Vij\nmatters.

But in MFV the coefficients parameterizing deviations from the\nU (3)5 -limit are highly suppressed [1] and so we expect the conclusions of the\nprevious subsection to hold. The elements Vij receive a common dominant\nshift plus suppressed channel-dependent corrections.\nIn a more general framework the situation can be different because the\nchannel-dependent shifts to Vij could be appreciable and \u2206CKM would depend on the channels used. Work in this direction is in progress.\n5. \u2206CKM versus precision EW measurements\n\nIn the limit of approximate U (3)5 invariance, we have shown that \u2206CKM\nconstraints a specific combination of the coefficients, that also contribute to\nthe EWPO [13], together with the remaining seventeen operators that make\nup the U (3)5 invariant sector of our TeV scale effective lagrangian.\nThe analysis of Han and Skiba [13], that studied the constraints on the\nsame set of twenty-one U (3)5 invariant operators via a global fit to the\nEWPO, allows us to compare the bound on \u2206CKM that we get from them\n\u2212 9.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 \u2264 \u2206CKM \u2264 0.1 \u00d7 10\u22123\n\n(90% C.L.) ,\n\n(22)\n\nwith the direct experimental bound |\u2206CKM | \u2264 1. \u00d7 10\u22123 (90% C.L.) [9]. We\nsee that EWPO leave room for a sizable non-zero \u2206CKM and consequently\nwe have to include the direct \u2206CKM constraint in the global fit to improve\nthe bounds on NP-couplings (see results in Fig. 1). We see that the main\n(3)\neffect is to strengthen the constraints on Olq .\nIn Fig. 2 we show the bounds if we assume a single operator dominance.\nFor all the CKM-operators the direct \u2206CKM measurement provides com(3)\npetitive constraints and in the case of Olq the improvement is remarkable.\nIf a non-zero \u2206CKM is observed, in the single-operator framework it would\nbe correlated to deviations from the SM expectation in other observables as\nwell. These correlations have been studied in ref. [1].\n\n\f5\n\nFig. 1. 90% C.L. regions projections, using the high energy observables (HEP), the\ncurrent \u2206CKM constraint or an alternative value of \u2206CKM = \u22120.0025 \u00b1 0.0006.\n\nFig. 2. 90 % C.L. regions in the single operator analysis. The first row displays the\nconstraint from EWPO and the second row those coming only from \u2206CKM .\n\n6. Conclusions\nIn a model-independent framework and assuming nearly flavor blind\nNP interactions, it has been shown that the extraction of Vud,us is channel\nindependent and the only NP probe is \u2206CKM , that receives contributions\n(3)\nfrom four short distance operators: Oll,lq,\u03c6l,\u03c6q .\nIt has been shown that Cabibbo universality tests provide constraints\non NP that currently cannot be obtained from other EW precision tests and\n\n\f6\n\ncollider measurements. The \u2206CKM constraint bounds the effective NP scale\n(3)\nof all four CKM-operators to be \u039b > 11 TeV (90 % C.L.), what for Olq is\nalmost one order of magnitude stronger than EWPO-bound. Equivalently,\nshould Vud and Vus move from their current central values [5], EWPO data\nwould leave room for sizable deviations from quark-lepton universality.\nAcknowledgments\nI thank V.
