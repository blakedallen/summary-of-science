It has very\ninteresting classical and quantum properties (for review see, i.e. [3]).\nGlobal structure of the BTZ solution was analyzed in [4, 5]. In these articles the black\nhole space-time was considered as the quotient space of the anti-de Sitter space by the\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nE-mail: guilherme@fisica.ufjf.br\nE-mail: katanaev@mi.ras.ru\n\n1\n\n\faction of the discrete transformation group. This approach deserves a deeper analysis\nbecause the transformation group has fixed points, and therefore the quotient space is\nnot a manifold. The situation is unclear especially in the interior region of the black hole.\nTo clarify the global structure of the interior region, we consider the BTZ solution for\nzero cosmological constant. In this simple case, all coordinate transformations can be\nwritten explicitly, and behavior of geodesics is analyzed. We prove that the maximally\nextended (along geodesics) BTZ solution for zero cosmological constant coincides with\nflat Minkowskian space-time without any singularity and horizons for infinite range of\nthe angle coordinate \u03c6. The BTZ solution in the original coordinates covers only one\nhalf of the Minkowskian space-time, and the two planes corresponding to r = 0 are just\ncoordinate singularities. Two copies of the BTZ solution cover the whole Minkowskian\nspace-time and are smoothly glued at r = 0.\nIf we make the angle identification \u03c6 \u223c \u03c6 + 2\u03c0 than four cones with the same vertex\nappear in the interior region of the BTZ black hole located at the inner horizon r\u2212 .\nNext we analyze the Euclidean version of the BTZ solution. In this case the solution\nhas physical interpretation in solid state physics. In the geometric theory of defects\ndeveloped in [6, 7, 8, 9] (for review see [10]) it depends on the Poisson ratio and describes\ncombined wedge and screw dislocations.\n\n2\n\nThe BTZ solution\n\nWe consider a three-dimensional manifold M with local coordinates x\u03bc , \u03bc = 0, 1, 2. Suppose it is endowed with a Lorentzian signature metric g\u03bc\u03bd (x), sign g\u03bc\u03bd = (+ \u2212 \u2212), which\nsatisfies Einstein's equations\nR\u03bc\u03bd = \u039bg\u03bc\u03bd\n(1)\nwith a cosmological constant \u039b = \u22122/l2 . In three dimensions the full curvature tensor is\ndefined by its Ricci tensor\nR\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 = \u2212\u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb \u03b5\u03c1\u03c3\u03b6 R\u03bb\u03b6 ,\n\nR\u03bc\u03bd = R\u03bc\u03c1\u03bd \u03c1\np\nwhere \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb is the totally antisymmetric tensor, \u01eb012 = det g\u03bc\u03bd . Therefore, any smooth\nsolution of Einstein's equations on a manifold (by solution we mean a pair (M, g)) is a\nspace-time of constant curvature. The universal covering spaces for positive, zero, and\nnegative cosmological constant are respectively de Sitter, Euclidean, and anti de Sitter\nspaces. All other smooth solutions (M, g) are obtained from these solutions by an action\nof an isometry transformation group which acts freely and properly discontinuous (see, i.e.\n[11]). Afterwards, a solution will be isometric to some fundamental domain of de Sitter,\nEuclidean, or anti de Sitter space with properly identified boundaries. These solutions\nare considered as known ones though explicit action of a transformation group may be\nquite complicated. All these solutions are smooth, have no singularities and horizons, and\ntherefore do not describe black holes.\nTheory becomes much richer if we admit the existence of singularities at points, lines,\n\n2\n\n\for surfaces in M. The famous BTZ solution is [1]\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u00132\nJ2\ndr 2\nJ\nr2\n2\n2\n2\n\u0001 \u2212 r d\u03c6 \u2212 2 dt ,\nds = \u2212M + 2 + 2 dt \u2212\nJ2\nr2\n4r\nl\n2r\n\u2212M + 4r\n2 + l2\n\u0013\n\u0012\ndr 2\nr2\n\u0001 \u2212 r 2 d\u03c62 + Jdtd\u03c6,\n= \u2212M + 2 dt2 \u2212\nJ2\nr2\nl\n\u2212M + 4r\n+\n2\nl2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere M and J are two integration constants, having physical interpretation of the mass\nand angular momentum of the black hole. We shall see later that the inner horizon r\u2212\nbecomes a line in M with four cones at each point. This solution is supposed to be written\nin cylindrical coordinate system\nt \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, \u221e), r \u2208 (0, \u221e), \u03c6 \u2208 (0, 2\u03c0).\n\n(3)\n\nMetric (2) has two commuting Killing vector fields: K1 = \u2202t and K2 = \u2202\u03c6 .\nOuter r+ and inner r\u2212 horizons of the BTZ solution\n!\nr\n2\n2\nMl\nJ\n2\n1\u00b1 1\u2212 2 2\nr\u00b1\n=\n2\nM l\nare defined by two positive zeroes of the function\nN(r) = \u2212M +\n\nJ2\nr2\n+\n= 0.\n4r 2\nl2\n\nHere we assume that |J| < Ml.\nWe make four comments on the form of this solution.\n1) The space-time (M, g) with metric (2), (3) is not locally a constant curvature space,\nbecause any point lying in the singularity r = r\u2212 do not have a neighborhood of constant\ncurvature. Here we consider singular points (t, r = r\u2212 , \u03c6) belonging to M. In fact, we\nshall see that points r = r\u2212 are not points of a manifold, and do not have neighborhoods\ndiffeomorphic to a ball at all.\n2) The range of \u03c6 is determined by its interpretation as an angle in the region r \u2192 \u221e\nwhere the space-time becomes asymptotically anti-de Sitter. The mass is supposed to be\npositive, because otherwise there is no horizon. The case M < 0 and \u039b > 0, corresponding\nto de Sitter asymptotic (which has a horizon) is not considered because \u03c6 can not be\ninterpreted as the angle coordinate in this case. The sign of J corresponds to left and\nright rotations and does not contribute to the global structure of the solution. Thus, range\nof coordinates (3) and the signs of the cosmological constant and the mass are uniquely\ndetermined by two requirements: (i) \u03c6 is an angle in the asymptotic region r \u2192 \u221e and\n(ii) the solution has at least one horizon.\n3) For zero cosmological constant \u039b = 0 and angular momentum J = 0 the metric is\nds2 = \u2212Mdt2 +\n\ndr 2\n\u2212 r 2 d\u03c62 .\nM\n\nFor positive mass M > 0, it has no conical singularity at r = 0 because now r and \u03c6\nare coordinates on the two-dimensional Minkowskian space-time of signature (+\u2212) but\n3\n\n\fnot on the Euclidean plane. This is in contrast with a common belief that static point\nparticles in three-dimensional gravity are described by conical singularities, distributed\non a space-like section of M [12, 13, 14].\n4) There are four regions of r where coordinate lines t, r, and \u03c6 have different types of\ntangent vectors. Coordinate lines t and r may be either timelike or spacelike, depending on\nrange of r which has three distinguished points: r+ , r\u2212 , and r3 = Ml2 . The coordinate line\n\u03c6 is always spacelike. We summarize different properties of coordinates in the Table, where\nplus and minus signs denote respectively timelike and spacelike character of coordinates.\nWe see that the coordinate t is timelike only for large r > r3 . In two regions, r+ < r < r3\nr3 < r < \u221e\nr+ < r < r3\nr\u2212 < r < r+\n0 < r < r\u2212\n\nt r \u03c6\n+ \u2212 \u2212\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212\n\u2212 + \u2212\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212\n\nTable 1: Timelike \"+\" and spacelike \"\u2212\" character of coordinate lines in different regions\nof r.\nand 0 < r < r\u2212 , all coordinates are spacelike.\nGlobal structure of solution (2) was described in [4] in terms of the quotient space of\nthe anti-de Sitter space, and the Carter\u2013Penrose diagrams were drawn for the metric\ndl2 = Ndt2 \u2212 N \u22121 dr 2.\n\n(4)\n\nThis description deserves a deeper analysis especially at the vicinity of the singularity for\ntwo reasons. First, the transformation group used to obtain the quotient of the anti-de\nSitter space in [4] does not act freely because it has fixed points [5]. Second, the coordinate\nlines have different character, and the induced metric on sections of M corresponding to\nconstant angle \u03c6 = const differs essentially from (4). Therefore we can not say that the\nglobal solution is topologically the product of the Carter\u2013Penrose diagram on a circle.\nIn the next section we give a different description of the global structure in terms of the\nproduct of real line t\u2032 \u2208 R on the corresponding Carter\u2013Penrose diagram.\n\n3\n\nThe interior region of the BTZ black hole\n\nBy global solution we mean a pair (M, g) where (i) the metric satisfies Einstein's equations\nand (ii) any extremal (geodesic) either can be continued in both directions to an infinite\nvalue of the canonical parameter or it ends up at a singular point at a finite value. This\nsolution is also called maximally extended. To construct a maximally extended solution\nfor BTZ metric (2) we shall use a conformal block method described in [15] which was\ndeveloped for two-dimensional metrics having one Killing vector field.\nTo analyze global structure of the interior region of the BTZ black hole, we assume\nthat cosmological constant is zero, \u039b = 0 or l \u2192 \u221e. This assumption simplifies essentially\nformulae, which now may be written explicitly. Moreover, in this case the solution has\n4\n\n\fdirect interpretation in the geometric theory of defects describing a linear dislocation\nwhich is a combination of screw and wedge dislocations (see section 5).\nFor later comparison, we draw the Carter\u2013Penrose diagram for two-dimensional metric\n(4) with\nc2\n(5)\nN(r) = \u2212\u03b12 + 2 ,\nr\nwhere for simplicity we introduced new notations M = \u03b12 and c = J/2. In the geometric\ntheory of defects, \u03b1 = 1 + \u03b8, where \u03b8 is the deficit angle of the wedge dislocation, and\nc = b/2\u03c0, where b is the Burgers vector of the screw dislocation. The function (5) becomes\na conformal factor in coordinates t, r \u2032 where new radial coordinate r \u2032 is determined by the\nordinary differential equation\ndr\n= N(r).\ndr \u2032\nIn these coordinates, the global structure is easily analyzed [15], and the Carter\u2013Penrose\ndiagram for the surface with metric (4), (5) is shown in Fig. 1 It has one horizon at r\u2212 . In\nr=4\n\nr=4\nr_\n\nr_\nr=0\n\nr=0\n\nr=4\n\nr=4\n\nFigure 1: The Carter\u2013Penrose diagram corresponding to a surface with metric (4), (5).\nSolid lines denote complete null infinity. The timelike boundary r = 0 is incomplete, and\nthe two-dimensional curvature is singular here. Filled circles denote complete space and\ntime infinities.\nthe limit l \u2192 \u221e the outer horizon r+ moves to infinity and the boundary r = \u221e becomes\ngeodesically complete which is shown by solid thick lines. At the boundaries r = 0, the\ntwo dimensional curvature for metric (4), (5) is singular. Filled circles denote complete\nfuture, past and right, left \"infinities\". A circle in the center denotes incomplete vertex\nof conformal blocks. Unfortunately, the induced metric on sections of M corresponding\nto \u03c6 = const\ndr 2\ndl2 = \u2212\u03b12 dt2 \u2212\n2\n\u2212\u03b12 + rc2\n\nis quite different from (4), (5). This metric is degenerate at the horizon r\u2212 = c/\u03b1, where\nit changes signature. Therefore, we are not able to draw at least one Carter\u2013Penrose\ndiagram for it.\n5\n\n\fTo avoid this difficulty, we draw the Carter\u2013Penrose diagram for sections of constant\n\"time\" which is a spacelike coordinate inside the BTZ black hole. First, we diagonalize\nthe metric on M\ndr 2\n\u2212 r 2 d\u03c62 + 2cd\u03c6dt.\n(6)\nds2 = \u2212\u03b12 dt2 \u2212\nc2\n2\n\u2212\u03b1 + r2\n\nPerforming the linear nondegenerate coordinate transformation\nc\nt = t\u2032 + 2 \u03c6,\n\u03b1\nand keeping coordinates r and \u03c6 untouched, we obtain\n\u0013\n\u0012\ndr 2\nc2\n2\n2 \u20322\n2\nds = \u2212\u03b1 dt \u2212\n\u2212 r \u2212 2 d\u03c62 .\nc2\n2\n\u03b1\n\u2212\u03b1 + r2\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nNow the three-dimensional space-time can be represented as a product M = R \u00d7 U where\nt\u2032 \u2208 R and (r, \u03c6) \u2208 U. The two-dimensional surface U (sections of M corresponding\nto t\u2032 = const) possesses the induced metric of Lorentzian signature. At this point we\nassume that \u03c6 \u2208 R making the identification \u03c6 \u223c \u03c6 + 2\u03c0 afterwards. Changing the radial\ncoordinate,\n\u221a\nr = 2\u03b1\u03c3, \u03c3 > 0 for \u03b1 > 0,\n(9)\nthe induced metric on U becomes\ndl2 = \u2212\n\nc2 \u2212 2\u03b13 \u03c3 2\n\u03b12 d\u03c3 2\n+\nd\u03c6 .\nc2 \u2212 2\u03b13 \u03c3\n\u03b12\n\n(10)\n\nThe conformal factor for the induced metric N(\u03c3) = (c2 \u2212 2\u03b13 \u03c3)/\u03b12 is a linear function of\n\u03c3 and therefore describes a surface of zero two-dimensional curvature. It has one horizon\nat \u03c3\u2212 = c2 /2\u03b13 corresponding to inner horizon r\u2212 . The maximally extended surfaces\n(\u03c3, \u03c6) \u2208 U is represented by the Carter\u2013Penrose diagram in Fig. 2. Here the maximal\nextension requires the infinite range of coordinates \u03c3 \u2208 R and \u03c6 \u2208 R. To consolidate\nthis range of coordinates with the original radial coordinate (9) we assume that \u03c3 > 0\nfor \u03b1 > 0 and \u03c3 < 0 for \u03b1 < 0, and make the identification (\u03c3, \u03b1) \u223c (\u2212\u03c3, \u2212\u03b1). We see\nthat after the identification we must consider two-dimensional surfaces r = 0 for M as the\nboundary.\n\n3.1\n\nGeodesics\n\nThe behavior of geodesics for the BTZ solution was considered in [16, 17]. In the case of\nzero cosmological constant equations for geodesics are greatly simplified, and a general\nsolution can be written in elementary functions and analyzed in detail.\nTo understand the nature\nof the singularity at r\u2212 we analyze the behavior of geodesics\n\u0001\nx\u03bc (\u03c4 ) = t(\u03c4 ), r(\u03c4 ), \u03c6(\u03c4 ) for metric (6) in this section.

First, we note that any\nsystem of equations for geodesics has a conserved quantity: the length of a tangent vector\nC0 = g\u03bc\u03bd \u1e8b\u03bc \u1e8b\u03bd . It corresponds to conservation of energy of a point particle which, by\nassumption, moves along a geodesic line\nC0 = \u2212\u03b12 \u1e6b2 +\n\nr2\n\u1e59 2 \u2212 r 2 \u03c6\u03072 + 2c\u1e6b\u03c6\u0307.\n\u03b1 2 r 2 \u2212 c2\n\n(13)\n\n\u03bd\nAnother two conservations laws C1,2 = g\u03bc\u03bd \u1e8b\u03bc K1,2\ncorrespond to the symmetry of the\nmetric, generated by two Killing vector fields: K1 = \u2202t and K2 = \u2202\u03c6 .

We show\nthat the connected Lorentzian manifold breaks into disconnected pieces along horizons in\nthe Euclidean case.\nEquations for geodesics (16) can be integrated explicitly. To make clear further integration we perform the transformation to Cartesian coordinates.\n\n3.2\n\nTransformation to Cartesian coordinates\n\nIn this section we perform the coordinate transformation which brings the metric (8) into\nthe usual Lorentzian form and shows that the Carter\u2013Penrose diagram in Fig.2 represents\nthe Minkowskian plane. We consider three-dimensional Minkowskian space R1,2 with the\nLorentz metric in Cartesian coordinates\nds2 = dT 2 \u2212 dX 2 \u2212 dY 2 .\n\n(17)\n\nWe introduce polar coordinates 0 < R < \u221e, \u2212\u221e < \u03a6 < \u221e in each of the four quadrants\nin the T, X plane (see Fig.3)\nT\n\nII\nIII\n\nI\n\nX\n\nIV\n\nFigure 3: Polar coordinates in the Minkowskian plane. Solid lines are hyperbolas of constant R. Arrows show increasing of the angle \u03a6. Shadowed regions denote the fundamental\ndomain of the transformation group \u03a6 \u2192 \u03a6 + 2\u03c0\u03b1.\n\n8\n\n\fI : T = R sinh \u03a6,\nX = R cosh \u03a6,\nIII : T = \u2212R sinh \u03a6,\nX = \u2212R cosh \u03a6,\n\nII : T = R cosh \u03a6,\nX = R sinh \u03a6,\nIV : T = \u2212R cosh \u03a6,\nX = \u2212R sinh \u03a6.\n\nThis transformation is degenerate on two lines R = 0, and metric on the T, X plane\nbecomes\nI,III :\nII,IV :\n\ndl2 = \u2212dR2 + R2 d\u03a62 ,\ndl2 = dR2 \u2212 R2 d\u03a62 .\n\nPerforming the further transformation\n\u221a\nc2 \u2212 2\u03b13 \u03c3\n,\nI,III :\nR=\n\u03b12\n\u221a\n2\u03b13 \u03c3 \u2212 c2\nII,IV :\nR=\n,\n\u03b12\nI\u2013IV :\n\n\u03a6 = \u03b1\u03c6,\nY = \u03b1t\u2032 ,\n\n(18)\n\nc2\n\u03c3< 3\n2\u03b1\n\u03c3>\n\nc2\n2\u03b13\n\n\u2212\u221e < \u03c6 < \u221e,\n\u2212\u221e < t\u2032 < \u221e,\n\nwe arrive precisely to metric (8), (10).\nNow integrating equations (11) for geodesics becomes trivial. A general solution is\nT = t0 + v0 \u03c4,\nX = x0 + v1 \u03c4,\nY = y0 + v2 \u03c4,\nand depends on six arbitrary constants: a position of a point in the Minkowskian space\nt0 , x0 , y0 and a velocity v0 , v1 , v2 of the geodesic which goes through this point. The inverse\ntransformation, for example, in the first quadrant is\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u0013\u0015\n1\nc\nT\nt=\nY + 2 arcth\n,\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\nX\n1p 2\nr=\nc \u2212 \u03b14 (X 2 \u2212 T 2 ),\n\u03b1\n\u0012 \u0013\nT\n1\n.\n\u03c6 = arcth\n\u03b1\nX\nElementary analysis shows that constants of integration (13)\u2013(15) are\nC0 = v02 \u2212 v12 \u2212 v22 ,\nC1 = \u2212\u03b1v2 ,\ncv2\nC2 =\n+ \u03b1(x0 v0 \u2212 t0 v1 ).\n\u03b1\n\n9\n\n\fThe considered coordinate transformations prove that the Carter\u2013Penrose diagram in\nFig.2 represents a Minkowskian plane R1,1 . The global BTZ solution with zero cosmological constant is thus a product R \u00d7 R1,1 = R1,2 , i.e. a flat three-dimensional Minkowskian\nspace-time.\nNow the maximally extended BTZ solution with zero cosmological constant (6) and\ninfinite range of \u03c6 becomes transparent: it is a flat three-dimensional Minkowskian spacetime R1,2 without any singularity and horizons. BTZ solution (6) covers only one half of it.\nMaximal extension means that the BTZ solution for 0 < \u03c3 < \u221e is prolonged\n\u221a to negative\nvalues \u2212\u221e < \u03c3 < \u221e. For negative \u03c3 we can define new coordinate r = 2\u03b1\u03c3, \u03c3 < 0\nand \u03b1 < 0 and again arrive at the BTZ solution. Thus, two copies of BTZ solution cover\nthe whole Minkowskian space-time R1,2 and are smoothly glued together at r = 0. The\n\"singularity\" at r = 0 is a purely coordinate one which is clear from the transformation\n(9). We stress that the above analysis was performed for the whole range of the angle\n\u03c6 \u2208 R. The periodicity of the angle will be considered in the next section.\n\n3.3\n\nPeriodicity of \u03c6\n\nHaving in mind that the coordinate \u03c6 is interpreted as the angle 0 < \u03c6 < 2\u03c0 in the\nexterior region of the BTZ solution with negative cosmological constant, we assume that\nthe identification \u03c6 \u223c \u03c6 + 2\u03c0 takes also place for zero cosmological constant. The transformation group G : \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6 + 2\u03c0 acts freely and properly discontinuous on a line \u03c6 \u2208 R\nbut not in the Minkowskian space-time R1,2 . In the last case it has fixed points and the\nquotient space R1,2 /G itself is not a manifold.\nPeriodicity in \u03c6 means periodicity in the polar angle \u03a6 \u223c \u03a6 + 2\u03c0\u03b1 in the Minkowskian\nplane T, X considered in the previous section. The transformation group identifies points\nalong hyperbolas R = const corresponding to different polar angles \u03a6 \u223c \u03a6 + 2\u03c0\u03b1. Its\naction is not defined on two lines R = 0 where polar coordinates are degenerate. Considering these lines as the limit of hyperbolas, we assume that all their points are mapped\ninto the origin under the action of the transformation group G. Then the transformation\ngroup acting in the T, X plane has the fundamental domain consisting of four wedges\nwith identified boundaries shown by shadowed regions in Fig. 3. We denote them by I-IV\naccording to the number of the corresponding quadrant. Identifying boundaries of the\nwedge makes it a cone. The vertexes of cones are glued in the origin of the Cartesian\ncoordinate system. The origin is a fixed point for the transformation group and not a\npoint of a manifold. Indeed, it does not have a neighborhood diffeomorphic to a disc.\nAt the same time, it can not be excluded from the space-time because it lies at a finite\ndistance. Thus, we have four cones in the Minkowskian plane with the common vertex\nin the origin. They are not conical singularities because the plane is equipped with the\nLorentzian signature metric.\nThe Killing vector K2 = \u2202\u03c6 = \u03b1\u2202\u03a6 of the whole three-dimensional metric (6) is also\nthe Killing vector for two-dimensional metric (18). Hence, the transformation group G is\nthe isometry for two-dimensional Minkowskian plane T, X.\nThe identification \u03c6 \u223c \u03c6 + 2\u03c0 acts also nontrivially on the third \"time\" coordinate t\u2032\nin (7), but it remains well defined.\nNow we analyze the behavior of geodesics in the T, X plane. They are clearly straight\n10\n\n\flines before the identification. Let us fix an arbitrary fundamental domain (\u03a60 , \u03a60 + 2\u03c0\u03b1)\nand a timelike geodesic 1, shown in Fig. 4. Particle moving along geodesic 1 in the T, X\nplane wraps around a cone. Its trajectory is represented by the sequence of segments of\nstraight lines in the fundamental domain, each segment representing one rotation around\nthe cone. The equation of geodesic 1 in polar coordinates in the first quadrant is\nR = R0\n\ntan \u03b31 cosh \u03a60 \u2212 sinh \u03a60\n,\ntan \u03b31 cosh \u03a6 \u2212 sinh \u03a6\n\nwhere \u03b31 is the inclination of the line 1. Its segment from R0 to\nR1 = R0\n\ntan \u03b31 cosh \u03a60 \u2212 sinh \u03a60\ntan \u03b31 cosh(\u03a6 + 2\u03c0\u03b1) \u2212 sinh(\u03a60 + 2\u03c0\u03b1)\n\nbelongs to the fundamental domain.

It\nconsists of segments of straight lines with inclinations \u03b31 , \u03b32 , \u03b33 , . . . which cross the line\n\u03a60 respectively at points R0 , R1 , R2 , . . . .\n\u03a6 \u2208 (\u03a60 + 2\u03c0\u03b1, \u03a60 + 4\u03c0\u03b1) is identified with the segment of line 2 lying in the fundamental\ndomain (\u03a60 , \u03a60 + 2\u03c0\u03b1) but having different inclination \u03b32 . Continuing this procedure, we\nobtain equation for the k-th line\nR = Rk\u22121\nwhere\nRk = R0\n\ntan \u03b3k cosh \u03a60 \u2212 sinh \u03a60\n,\ntan \u03b3k cosh \u03a6 \u2212 sinh \u03a6\n\ntan \u03b31 cosh \u03a60 \u2212 sinh \u03a60\n,\ntan \u03b31 cosh(\u03a60 + \u03b1k ) \u2212 sinh(\u03a60 + \u03b1k )\n\nand we introduced shorthand notation\n\n\u03b1k = 2\u03c0\u03b1k,\n\nk = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, . . . .\n11\n\n(19)\n\n\fOn the other hand, the segment of line k in the fundamental domain can be obtained as\nthe projection of the segment of the previous line k \u2212 1\nRk = Rk\u22121\n\ntan \u03b3k cosh \u03a60 \u2212 sinh \u03a60\n.\ntan \u03b3k cosh(\u03a60 + \u03b11 ) \u2212 sinh(\u03a60 + \u03b11 )\n\n(20)\n\nComparing Eqs. (19) and (20), we express the inclination angle \u03b3k of the k-th line through\nthe original inclination angle \u03b31\ntan \u03b3k =\n\ntan \u03b31 \u2212 tanh \u03b1k\u22121\n.\n1 \u2212 tan \u03b31 tanh \u03b1k\u22121\n\n(21)\n\nIt is important that the inclination angles of segments depend only on the original inclination angle \u03b31 . They do not depend on the fundamental domain characterized by the\nangle \u03a60 and the distance from the origin R0 .\nEquation (21) is also valid for lightlike and spacelike geodesics.\nAs the consequence of Eq.(21), we see that segments of all lightlike geodesics tan \u03b31 =\n\u00b11 remain lightlike tan \u03b3k = \u00b11. All segments for timelike and spacelike geodesics are\nrespectively timelike and spacelike having the same limit\nlim tan \u03b3k = \u22131.\n\nk\u2192\u00b1\u221e\n\nWe see also that there are no closed timelike geodesics.\nTo get a deeper insight into the behavior of geodesics we consider \u03b1k as a continuous\nvariable\ntan \u03b31 \u2212 tanh \u03b1\ntan \u03b3\u03b1 =\n.\n1 \u2212 tan \u03b31 tanh \u03b1\nThis function is plotted in Fig.5. For timelike geodesics | tan \u03b31 | > 1 it is singular when\ntanh \u03b1 tan \u03b31 = 1\n\n(22)\n\nand has two branches. The upper and lower branches correspond to the motion of a\nparticle respectively to the right and left in the first quadrant, the singularity (22) being\nthe turning point.\nAll timelike geodesics start and end at the origin of the Cartesian coordinate system\nat finite values of proper time parameter making infinite number of rotations around the\ncone. Spacelike geodesics which do not lie entirely in one fundamental region approach\nthe origin on the left making infinite number of rotations at a finite value of canonical\nparameter and go to the right space infinity.\nTo understand the behavior of geodesics in other quadrants, it is sufficient to rotate\nthe picture on ninety degrees.\nThe behavior of geodesics at the origin of Cartesian coordinates is not defined. It can\nbe naturally done by unfolding the cones and going back to Minkowskian plane T, X.\nThen timelike geodesics which do not cross boundary of the fundamental region IV are\ncontinued to the fundamental region II. Those timelike geodesics which cross the boundary\nof the fundamental region IV are continued to the fundamental domain I or III depending\non the inclination. In the region I they move to the right at a finite distance, then return\n12\n\n\ftg ga\n|tg g1 |>1\n\n1\n\n|tg g1 |<1\n\na\n-1\n\n|tg g1 |>1\n\nFigure 5: The inclination of the trajectory segment versus continuous parameter \u03b1k \u2192\n\u03b1. For timelike geodesics | tan \u03b31 | > 1, it has two branches with the singularity at\ntanh \u03b1 tan \u03b31 = 1, corresponding to the turning point. The dependence is smooth for\nspacelike geodesics | tan \u03b31 | < 1.\nback to the origin, and are continued to the fundamental domain II. We draw trajectory\nof a static particle in the T, X plane after the identification in Fig.6.\nTimelike curves R = const (which are not geodesics) are closed loops after the identification \u03a6 \u223c \u03a6 + 2\u03c0\u03b1. Thus, any particle with constant acceleration (in terms of Cartesian\ncoordinates) has a closed timelike world line at regions I,III.\nTo conclude this section, we draw the Carter\u2013Penrose diagram for the Minkowskian\nplane after the polar angle identification \u03a6 \u223c \u03a6 + 2\u03c0\u03b1 in Fig.7. It looks like a flower.\n\n4\n\nEuclidean version of the interior of the BTZ solution\n\nThe Euclidean version of the BTZ solution was considered in [18] when analyzing its\nthermodynamical properties. In this section we analyze global structure and geodesics of\nthe Euclidean BTZ solution for zero cosmological constant.\nHere, we use many notations from the previous section though their meaning in the\nEuclidean case is often different. We hope that this step does not cause any inconvenience\nand simplifies the comparison of the two cases.\nThe Euclidean counterpart of the BTZ metric (2) is given by the transformation\nr \u2192 ir, l \u2192 il, and J \u2192 \u2212J.

After the identification \u03c6 \u223c \u03c6 + 2\u03c0\nit makes infinite number of rotations around the cone in the fourth quadrant at a finite\nproper time. Afterwards it moves to the right in the first quadrant, returns back, making\nalso an infinite number of rotations near the cone vertex, and goes to the second quadrant.\nThere, after an infinite number of rotations, it goes to infinity.\nLet r\u00b1 denote two positive roots\n\u03b12 l 2\n2\nr\u00b1\n=\n2\n\nr\n\n!\n4c2\n1+ 4 2 \u00b11 .\n\u03b1 l\n\nThen metric (23) is degenerate at r = r+ , has Euclidean signature (+++) for r+ < r < \u221e,\nand Lorentzian signature (+ \u2212 \u2212) for 0 < r < r+ . In fact, this metric describes two\ndisjoint spaces: one for r+ < r < \u221e with the Euclidean signature metric, and the other\nfor 0 < r < r+ with the Lorentzian metric. This phenomena was demonstrated in the twodimensional case where connected Lorentzian surface breaks into disconnected Euclidean\npieces along horizons when going to the Euclidean signature metric [19], horizons giving\nrise to possible conical singularities. The absence of conical singularities is precisely\nthe definition of the Hawking temperature. The same phenomenon occurs also for zero\ncosmological constant (see Sec. 4.2).\nIn the limit l \u2192 \u221e, metric (23) reduces to the metric having Lorentzian signature\neverywhere and cannot be considered as the Euclidean version of (6). The Euclidean\ncounterpart of the BTZ metric for zero cosmological constant (6) is given by the transformation t \u2192 iz, \u03c6 \u2192 i\u03c6:\nds2 = \u03b12 dz 2 +\n\ndr 2\n+ r 2 d\u03c62 \u2212 2cd\u03c6dz.\nc2\n2\n\u03b1 \u2212 r2\n\n(24)\n\nThe range of coordinates is taken as\nr \u2208 (0, \u221e),\n\n\u03c6 \u2208 (0, 2\u03c0),\n14\n\nz \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, \u221e).\n\n(25)\n\n\fs= 4\n\ns=- 4\n\ns_\n\ns=- 4\n\ns= 4\n\nFigure 7: The Carter\u2013Penrose diagram for the Minkowskian plane after the polar angle\nidentification \u03a6 \u223c \u03a6 + 2\u03c0\u03b1.\nThis metric is degenerate at the horizon r\u2212 = c/\u03b1, has Euclidean signature (+ + +) for\nouter region r\u2212 < r < \u221e, and Lorentzian signature (+ \u2212 \u2212) for inner region 0 < r < r\u2212 .\nSo, our starting point is metric (24), (25) which is the Euclidean version of (6). The\nproblem is to find the space described by this metric. We show below that it describes\ntwo disjoint maximally extended manifolds, each being topologically equivalent to the\nEuclidean space R3 with the wedge cut out or added to it.\n\n4.1\n\nTransformation to Cartesian coordinates\n\nFirst, we consider the region c/\u03b1 < r < \u221e, where metric (24) has Euclidean signature.\nThis domain can be easily shown to be diffeomorphic to the whole Euclidean space R3\nwith the wedge of angle 2\u03c0\u03b8, where \u03b8 = \u03b1 \u2212 1, cut out or added. For negative and positive\n\u03b8 the wedge is respectively cut out or added to R3 .\nLet X, Y, Z be Cartesian coordinates in R3\nds2 = dX 2 + dY 2 + dZ 2 = dR2 + R2 d\u03a62 + dZ 2,\n\n(26)\n\nwhere R, \u03a6 are polar coordinates in the X, Y plane. Then the coordinate transformation:\nr\nr\nc\nc2\nR=\n< r < \u221e,\n1 \u2212 2 2,\n\u03b1\n\u03b1 r\n\u03b1\n(27)\n\u03a6 = \u03b1\u03c6,\n0 < \u03a6 < 2\u03c0\u03b1,\nc\n\u2212\u221e < z < \u221e,\nZ = \u03b1z \u2212 \u03c6,\n\u03b1\nbrings metric to the form (24). The wedge is cut out or added to the Euclidean space\nbecause the angle \u03a6 ranges from 0 to 2\u03c0\u03b1. This is determined by the original range of\ncoordinates (25). The sides of the wedge are identified (glued together). The axis R = 0\nis mapped into the horizon r\u2212 which is now the surface of the cylinder.\n15\n\n\fThe inverse transformation to (27) is\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u0013\u0015\n1\nc\nY\nz=\nZ + 2 arctan\n,\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\nX\n1p 2\nc + \u03b14 (X 2 + Y 2 ),\nr=\n\u03b1\n\u0012 \u0013\n1\nY\n\u03c6 = arctan\n.\n\u03b1\nX\nThe inner region 0 < r < r\u2212 is diffeomorphic to the Minkowskian space-time R1,2 with\nthe metric\nds2 = \u2212dX 2 \u2212 dY 2 + dZ 2 = \u2212R2 d\u03a62 \u2212 R2 d\u03a62 + dZ 2.\n(28)\nThe coordinate transformation\nr\nc\nr\nc2\n\u2212\n1,\n0\n<\nr\n<\n,\nR=\n\u03b1 \u03b12 r 2\n\u03b1\n\u03a6 = \u03b1\u03c6,\n0 < \u03a6 < 2\u03c0\u03b1,\nc\nZ = \u03b1z \u2212 \u03c6,\n\u2212\u221e < z < \u221e.\n\u03b1\n\n(29)\n\ntransforms metric (28) also in the form (24). The range of the angle \u03a6 differs from 2\u03c0.\nTherefore, the wedge is cut out or added to the Minkowskian space-time as in the previous\ncase. The axis R = 0 and infinity R = \u221e are respectively mapped into the horizon r\u2212\nand the axis r = 0.\n\n4.2\n\nGeodesics\n\nTo answer the question what is described by metric (24), (25), we must analyze the\nbehavior of geodesics.

Elementary analysis shows that\nC0 = v12 + v22 + v32 ,\nC1 = \u03b1v3 ,\nc\nC2 = \u2212 v3 + \u03b1(x0 v2 \u2212 y0 v1 ).\n\u03b1\nTo make the difference between Lorentzian and Euclidean cases clear, we solve Eqs.\n(31) with respect to the first derivatives\nr 2 C1 + cC2\n\u017c = 2 2\n,\n\u03b1 r \u2212 c2\nr 2 C12 + 2cC1 C2 + \u03b12 C22\n\u03b1 2 r 2 \u2212 c2\nC\n\u2212\n,\n\u1e59 2 =\n0\nr2\nr2\ncC1 + \u03b12 C2\n\u03c6\u0307 = 2 2\n.\n\u03b1 r \u2212 c2\n\n(32)\n\nThe essential difference from the Lorentzian case (16) is the sign before the second term\nin the expression for \u1e59 2 . At the horizon r\u2212 = c/\u03b1 we have\n\u1e59 2 = \u2212\n\n(cC1 + \u03b12 C2 )2\nc2\n\nWe see that horizon is reached only by geodesics with cC1 + \u03b12 C2 = 0 because the right\nhand side of this equation must be positive. For these geodesics\n\u03c6\u0307 = 0,\n\n\u017c = \u2212\n\nC2\n.\nc\n\nThis means that in each plane z = const only radial geodesics reach the surface of the\ncylinder r = r\u2212 . Therefore, there are not enough geodesics to consider the boundary of\nthe cylinder as a two-dimensional surface. Moreover, the circumference of the cylinder\nmeasured with metric (24) is zero. We conclude that the boundary of the cylinder r = r\u2212\nis, in fact, a line. For the Lorentzian signature metric, there is no restriction on geodesics\nwhich reach the horizon due to the difference in signs.\nPrevious analysis indicates that the connected Lorentzian manifold breaks into disconnected pieces along horizons for the Euclidean case. To prove this, we consider another\ncoordinate transformation R, \u03a6, Z \u2192 f, \u03c8, \u03b6:\nf\n,\n\u03b1\n\u03a6 = \u03b1\u03c8,\nZ = \u03b6 \u2212 c\u03c8.\n\nR=\n\n17\n\n(33)\n\n\fIn these coordinates the flat metric (26) becomes\nds2 =\n\n1 2\ndf + (f 2 + c2 )d\u03c8 2 + d\u03b6 2 \u2212 2cd\u03b6d\u03c8,\n2\n\u03b1\n\n(34)\n\nbut now the angle range is \u03c8 \u2208 (0, 2\u03c0), and coordinates f, \u03c8, \u03b6 cover the whole R3 and\nnothing else. (We use the unusual notation f for the radial coordinate because in the next\nsection it is transformed f = f (\u03c1).) This metric describes the space which is topologically\nR3 with the \"shifted\" conical singularities along the \u03b6 axis. In the case c = 0, we have\nordinary conical singularity in each section \u03b6 = const. This space is geodesically complete\nat infinity f \u2192 \u221e because all geodesics in the original X, Y, Z coordinate are complete.\nThus, the exterior region r\u2212 < r < \u221e of the Euclidean BTZ metric for zero cosmological\nconstant describes Euclidean space with \"shifted\" conical singularities at the \u03b6 axis. It is\nthe maximally extended manifold.\nMetric (34) is the Euclidean version of the metric considered in [14] and has straightforward interpretation in solid state physics considered in the next section.\nSimilar analysis can be performed for the interior region, and we do not repeat it\nhere. In fact, it is obvious from coordinate transformation (29) that the axis z for metric\n(24) represents infinity and the surface of the cylinder is the \"shifted\" conical singularity\nat the Z axis of three-dimensional Minkowskian space-time (28). This manifold is also\nmaximally extended.\nTherefore metric (24), (25) describes two disjoint maximally extended manifolds: the\nEuclidean space R3 and the Minkowskian space-time R1,2 with \"shifted\" conical singularities at the Z axis.\n\n5\n\nSolid state physics interpretation\n\nIn the geometric theory of defects (for review see [10]) pure elastic deformations describe\ndiffeomorphisms of the flat Euclidean space R3 . The presence of defects: dislocations\n(defects in elastic media) and disclinations (defects in the spin structure), gives rise to\nnontrivial Riemann\u2013Cartan geometry in R3 , the curvature and torsion tensor being interpreted as the surface density of Burgers and Frank vectors, respectively. In the absence\nof disclinations, curvature is equal to zero, and we have the space of absolute parallelism\ncharacterized only by nontrivial torsion. In this case, the SO(3)-connection is a pure gauge\ndefined by the gauge conditions, and torsion is given by the triad field e\u03bc i which satisfies\nEuclidean Einstein's equations with nontrivial sources (energy-momentum tensor). The\ncorresponding Einstein's equations are written for the induced metric\ng\u03bc\u03bd = e\u03bc i e\u03bd j \u03b4ij ,\n\n\u03b4ij = diag (+ + +),\n\nwhile the curvature tensor for the SO(3)-connection remains identically equal to zero. For\ncontinuous distribution of dislocations, the sources are described by continuous functions,\nand for single defects, we have \u03b4-function type sources in the right hand side of Euclidean\nEinstein's equations.\nMetric (34) satisfies free Euclidean Einstein's equations everywhere except the \u03b6 axis,\nwhere we have a \"shifted\" conical singularity. We do not analyze the corresponding source\nhere but simply give physical interpretation of this solution.\n18\n\n\fThe coordinate transformation from the flat Euclidean space (33) has the following\ninterpretation in solid state physics. At the beginning, we have undeformed elastic media\nwhich is the flat Euclidean space R3 . For negative deficit angle 2\u03c0\u03b8, the wedge with the\nedge along the Z axis and the angle 2\u03c0|\u03b8| is cut out from the media (see Fig.). For\npositive deficit angle, the wedge of the same media is added. Then the lower side of\n\nY\n\nX\n\nR0\n\nZ\n\nq\n\nb\n\nFigure 8: The combined wedge and screw dislocation. The picture is drawn for negative\ndeficit angle \u03b8 and the Burgers vector b which is antiparallel to the Z axis.\nthe cut is moved along the Z axis in the opposite direction on the distance b = 2\u03c0c,\nwhere b is the Burgers vector, and both sides of the cut are glued together. The cut out\nor added wedge of media corresponds to the wedge dislocation, and the displacement of\nthe lower side of the cut along the Z axis describes the screw dislocation. Both types\nof dislocations are experimentally observed defects in real crystals (see i.e. [20]). Thus,\nmetric (34) qualitatively describes nontrivial geometry around combined wedge and screw\ndislocations. For this metric, we can construct triad field and the corresponding torsion\ntensor which is equal to the surface density of the Burgers vector.\nWe used the word \"qualitatively\" because a solution of Einstein's equations can be\nwritten in an arbitrary coordinate system and does not depend on Lame coefficients\nwhich characterize the elastic properties of media. The coordinate transformation (33)\ndescribes only cut and paste process of defect creation. In reality, the media comes to\nthe equilibrium state after gluing both sides of the cut, and this process is driven by\nthe elasticity theory equations. Therefore, the induced metric must depend on Lame\ncoefficients. To consolidate gravity and elasticity theories we proposed to use the elastic\ngauge [8]. It is given by the following construction. First, we fix the cylindrical coordinates\n\u03c1, \u03c8, \u03b6 in the Euclidean space related to the considered problem. The flat metric and the\ntriad field are marked with a circle over a symbol\n\u25e6\n\nds2 = g \u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd = d\u03c12 + \u03c12 d\u03c8 2 + d\u03b6 2 ,\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1 0 0\n\u25e6\ne\u03bc i = \uf8ed0 \u03c1 0\uf8f8\n0 0 1\n19\n\n\fThen the elastic gauge is chosen to be\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\ng \u03bc\u03bd \u2207\u03bc e\u03bdi +\n\n\u03c3 \u25e6\u03bc \u25e6 T\ne i \u2207\u03bc e = 0,\n1 \u2212 2\u03c3\n\n(35)\n\n\u25e6\n\nwhere a circle over the covariant derivative \u2207\u03bc means that it is constructed for flat metric\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\ng \u03bc\u03bd ; eT = e\u03bc i e\u03bc i , and \u03c3 = const is the Poisson ratio defined by the Lame coefficients [22].\nPhysical meaning of this gauge condition is based on the linear approximation. Suppose defects are absent, and we have only elastic deformations described by the displacement vector field ui (x) which parameterizes diffeomorphisms of R3 . For simplicity, we\nassume that it is given in the Cartesian coordinate system. Than, for small relative\ndisplacements |\u2202\u03bc ui| \u226a 1, the induced triad field can be chosen in the form (there is a\nfreedom in local SO(3) rotations):\n1\ne\u03bci \u2248 \u03b4\u03bci \u2212 (\u2202\u03bc ui + \u2202i u\u03bc ).\n2\n\n(36)\n\nIn the linear approximation in Cartesian coordinates, Latin and Greek indices may be\nidentified. Then the elastic gauge condition (35) reduces to the usual linear elasticity\ntheory equations for the displacement vector field [22]\n(1 \u2212 2\u03c3)\u25b3ui + \u2202i \u2202j uj = 0,\n\n(37)\n\nand the reduction of Eq. (35) to Eq. (37) is quite obvious. Introduction of flat covariant\nderivatives in the elastic gauge (35) allows us to use arbitrary coordinate systems.\nThe triad field corresponding to metric (34) is\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1 0 0\n\uf8ec\u03b1\n\uf8f7\ne\u03bc i = \uf8ed 0 f \u2212c\uf8f8 .\n(38)\n0 0 1\n\nThe f, \u03c8 part of the triad corresponds to the symmetrized linear approximation (36), and\nthe constant unsymmetrical \u03c8 part does not alter the form of the elastic gauge condition.\nWe change the radial coordinate f = f (\u03c1) to rewrite the triad in the elastic gauge. Then\nthe elastic gauge condition (35) reduces to the Euler ordinary differential equation\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\nf \u2032\u2032\n\u03c3\nf\u2032 1\nf\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\n1+\n+\n\u2212 2 1+\n= 0.\n(39)\n+\n\u03b1\n1 \u2212 2\u03c3\n\u03c1 \u03b1 1 \u2212 2\u03c3\n\u03c1\n1 \u2212 2\u03c3\nThis is the same equation which arises for pure wedge dislocation [8] (the interested reader\ncan find more details there). To uniquely fix the solution of this equation, we suppose that\nthe media fills only the cylinder of finite radius R0 (this is needed to avoid divergences)\nand impose two additional gauge conditions\ne\u03c1 \u03c1 |\u03c1=R0 = 1,\n\ne\u03c8 \u03c8 |\u03c1=0 = 0.\n\nThe first gauge condition means the absence of external forces on the surface of the\ncylinder, and the second one corresponds to the absence of the angular component of\n20\n\n\fthe deformation tensor at the core of dislocation. Afterwards, the solution of Eq.(39) is\nuniquely defined\n\u03b1\n\u03b3\nf=\n\u03b3\u22121 \u03c1 ,\n\u03b3R0\nwhere\n\u221a\n\u03c3\n\u03b3 = \u2212\u03b8B + \u03b82 B 2 + 1 + \u03b8, B =\n.\n2(1 \u2212 \u03c3)\n\nThus, the Euclidean version of the BTZ solution for zero cosmological constant (34) in\nthe elastic gauge (35) becomes\n!\n\u0012 \u00132(\u03b3\u22121)\n\u0012 \u00132(\u03b3\u22121)\n2\n\u03c1\n\u03b1\n\u03c1\n(40)\nd\u03c12 +\n\u03c12 + c2 d\u03c8 2 + d\u03b6 2 \u2212 2cd\u03b6d\u03c8.\nds2 =\nR0\n\u03b3 2 R0\n\nThis is the exact solution of the Euclidean Einstein equations written in the elastic gauge.\nIt describes the induced metric around combined wedge and screw dislocations and nontrivially depends on the Poisson ratio characterizing the elastic properties of media. Below, this solution is compared with the result obtained entirely within the elasticity theory\nwithout referring to Einstein equations.\nThe wedge and screw dislocations are relatively simple linear defects in solids, and the\ncorresponding displacement vector field can be explicitly found as the solution to the linear\nelasticity field equations (37). The results are well known, and we skip their derivation.\nThe displacement vector field for the wedge dislocation in cylindrical coordinates R, \u03a6, Z\nis [21]\n1 \u2212 2\u03c3\n\u03c1\n(wedge)\n(wedge)\n(wedge)\nuR\n= \u2212\u03b8\n\u03c1 ln\n, u\u03a8\n= \u2212\u03b8\u03c1\u03c6, uZ\n= 0,\n(41)\n2(1 \u2212 \u03c3)\neR0\nwhere e is the base of the natural logarithm.

The displacements vectors can be added in the linear elasticity theory, and the total displacement vector for combined wedge and screw dislocations\nbecomes\nu = u(wedge) + u(screw) .\nIn our notations, the coordinate transformation corresponding to this displacement vector\nfield is\n1\nR = \u03c1 \u2212 uR , \u03a6 = \u03c6 \u2212 u\u03a6 , Z = \u03b6 \u2212 uZ .\n\u03c1\nThe induced metric within the elasticity theory becomes\nds2(elastic) = dR2 + R2 d\u03a62 + dZ 2 =\n\u0015\n\u0013\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 \u2212 2\u03c3\n1 \u2212 2\u03c3\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n1\n2\n2\n2\nd\u03c1 + \u03c1 1 + \u03b8\n+ c d\u03c62\n= 1+\u03b8\nln\nln\n+\u03b8\n1\u2212\u03c3\nR0\n1\u2212\u03c3\nR0\n1\u2212\u03c3\n+ d\u03b6 2 \u2212 2cd\u03b6d\u03c6.\n(43)\n21\n\n\fThe linear elasticity theory equations are valid for small relative displacements \u2202\u03bc ui \u226a 1.\nTherefore, the induced metric in the elasticity theory is expected to give correct answer\nfor small deficit angle \u03b8 \u226a 1, small Burgers vector b/R0 \u226a 1, and near the surface of the\ncylinder \u03c1 \u223c R0 .\nTo compare metrics (40) and (43), it is enough to consider small deficit angles. For\n\u03b8 \u226a 1,\n1 \u2212 2\u03c3\n.\n\u03b3 \u22481+\u03b8\n2(1 \u2212 \u03c3)\n\nExpanding expression (40) in \u03b8, we obtain metric (43) in the linear approximation.\nSo, the elasticity theory induced metric reproduces only the linear approximation of\nthe exact solution of the Euclidean Einstein's equations within the geometric theory of\ndefects. Metric (40) obtained within the geometric approach is simpler in its form, valid\nfor the whole range of radius 0 < \u03c1 < R0 , all deficit angles \u22121 < \u03b8 < \u221e, and Burgers\nvectors b. The components of the induced metric are proportional to the stress tensor\nof media. Therefore, the result obtained within the geometric theory of defects can be\nverified experimentally.\n\n6\n\nConclusion\n\nWe considered the BTZ black hole solution for zero cosmological constant in detail. This\ncase describes the interior region of the BTZ black hole and is simple enough to perform\nall calculation explicitly. We showed that points at r = 0 are just coordinate singularities,\nand all geometric quantities are regular there, while the line r = r\u2212 corresponding to the\ninner horizon is singular: these points are not points of a manifold. There are four cones\nat each point of the line r = r\u2212 . The singularity arises only after the identification of the\npolar angle \u03c6 \u223c \u03c6 + 2\u03c0.\nThe singularity structure is probably the same in a general case for negative cosmological constant, though it is analyzed only for zero cosmological constant.\nIn the Euclidean case, the BTZ solution for zero cosmological constant breaks into\ntwo disjoint manifolds along the horizon r = r\u2212 with Euclidean and Lorentzian signature\nmetrics. The manifold with the Euclidean signature metric has straightforward physical\ninterpretation in the geometric theory of defects describing combined wedge and screw\ndislocations in crystals. We showed that the induced metric obtained entirely within the\nordinary elasticity theory provides only the linear approximation for the exact solution of\nEinstein's equations. The Euclidean metric in the elastic gauge obtained from the BTZ\nsolution depends nontrivially on Lame coefficients and can be measured experimentally.\nThe Euclidean version of the BTZ solution for negative cosmological constant has\nalso straightforward interpretation in the geometric theory of defects, but in this case it\ndescribes continuous distribution of dislocations and is not so visual.\nAcknowledgments.
