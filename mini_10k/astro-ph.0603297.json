Indirect evidence comes from high pulsar velocities1, associations of\nsupernovae with long-soft \" -ray bursts2,3, and asymmetries in late-time emission-line\nprofiles4. Spectropolarimetry provides a direct probe of young supernova geometry,\n\n!\nwith higher polarization\ngenerally indicating a greater departure from spherical\nsymmetry5,6. Large polarizations have been measured for 'stripped-envelope' (that is,\ntype Ic; ref. 7) supernovae, which confirms their non-spherical morphology8,9; but the\nexplosions of massive stars with intact hydrogen envelopes7,10 (type II-P supernovae)\nhave shown only weak polarizations at the early times observed11,12. Here we report\nmulti-epoch spectropolarimetry of a classic type II-P supernova that reveals the\nabrupt appearance of significant polarization when the inner core is first exposed in\nthe thinning ejecta (~ 90 days after explosion). We infer a departure from spherical\nsymmetry of at least 30 per cent for the inner ejecta. Combined with earlier results,\nthis suggests that a strongly non-spherical explosion may be a generic feature of corecollapse supernovae of all types, where the asphericity in type II-P supernovae is\ncloaked at early times by the massive, opaque, hydrogen envelope.\nSN 2004dj was discovered13 on 31 July 2004 (UT) in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC\n2403, and was quickly identified14 as a core-collapse event with spectral features similar to\nthose of the type II-P supernova SN 1999em (ref. 10) about three weeks after explosion. At\nan estimated distance of 3.13 Mpc (ref. 15), it is the closest normal type II-P supernova\n\n\f3\n\nobserved to date. We present spectropolarimetry spanning the first nine months of its\ndevelopment in Table 1 and in Figs 1 and 2.\nThe light curve of SN 2004dj (Fig. 2) exhibits the classic features of a type II-P\nsupernova: an enduring period of nearly constant optical luminosity followed by a\nprecipitous drop in brightness and a smooth decline on the radioactive tail. The first three\nepochs of spectropolarimetry, obtained during the middle and end of the plateau phase, find\nthe supernova to be unpolarized (Fig. 1), indicating a substantially spherical geometry for\nthe electron-scattering atmosphere while the photosphere is receding back through the\nhydrogen envelope.\nA global asphericity of the electron-scattering atmosphere will manifest itself\nthrough two main spectropolarimetric signatures. First, there is significant polarization in\nspectral regions not dominated by line opacity, resulting from a non-balancing of the\nelectric vectors of the scattered continuum photons5,8. For type II-P supernovae, this\nincludes the broad spectral region 6800 \u2013 8200 \u00c5 (ref. 20). Very little polarization should\nbe seen in spectral regions shortward of wavelength \" \" 5500 \u00c5 owing to line-blanketing\nby Fe; other spectral regions with strong individual emission lines (for example, H \" and\n\n!!\nCa II near-infrared triplet) should also be relatively\nunpolarized16. Second, polarization\n!\nincreases are anticipated in the troughs of strong P-Cygni absorption lines11,21. This results\n\nfrom selective blocking of more forward-scattered and, hence, less polarized, light in the\ntrough regions. A further expectation resulting from a global asphericity, as opposed to\nother potential supernova polarization mechanisms (see ref. 17 for an extensive discussion),\nis that no rotation of the polarization angle (PA) should be seen across these absorption-line\nline features.\n\n\f4\n\nOnce the ionized hydrogen envelope has recombined, the optical brightness of a type\nII-P supernova drops dramatically as the recombination front rapidly recedes through the\nhelium core20.\n\nPrevious studies12 have noted the confluence of factors making the drop-\n\noff of the plateau a propitious period in which to search for evidence of explosion\nasphericity, as the innermost regions are exposed at a point when sufficient optical depth to\nelectron scattering in the inner core still exists to polarize the light and, hence, reveal the\ngeometry. Our fourth spectropolarimetric observation captures this moment in a type II-P\nsupernova (to our knowledge, for the first time). Taken during the steepest part of the\ndescent off the plateau (Fig. 2), on day 91 after explosion, the data show a dramatic change\nfrom those obtained just 19 days earlier: the polarization level has increased to nearly 0.6%\nin the continuum-dominated region 6800 - 8200 \u00c5 (Fig. 1), as well as in the troughs of\nsome of the stronger P-Cygni line features, including most prominently that due to Na I D.\nThe PAs in the P-Cygni troughs agree with the continuum PA, with a measured value of\n\n\" = 32\u00b0 \u00b1 3\u00b0 in the Na I D absorption compared with \" = 28\u00b0 \u00b1 2\u00b0 for the continuum region.\nThe observed spectropolarimetric behavior of SN 2004dj matches expectations resulting\n\n!\n\n!\nfrom a strong departure from spherical symmetry for the electron-scattering atmosphere in\nthe inner regions of the ejecta (expansion velocities less than ~2,500 km s-1, or about 1/10\nthe radius of the supernova assuming a maximum ejecta velocity of ~25,000 km s-1).\nAs SN 2004dj moves into the nebular phase and the atmosphere continues to expand,\nthe optical depth to electron scattering, and thus the polarization, is expected to fall.\nSpecifically, if the day 91 observation occurred at or beyond the time when the singlescattering limit is reached in the supernova's atmosphere (a single-scattering atmosphere\nproduces maximum supernova polarization6), then the polarization should subsequently\n\n\f5\n\ndecrease in proportion to the (angle-averaged) electron-scattering optical depth, as this\ndetermines the percentage of scattered light. For this simple scenario, the polarization\nwould be expected to decline with time t as 1/ t 2 , owing to geometrical dilution caused by\nhomologous expansion (that is, the same number of scattering electrons spread over a\n!\n\ncross-sectional area that grows as\n\nt 2 ).\n\nThis prediction is borne out rather well by the data\n\n(Fig. 2), although there is some evidence suggestive of a more complex situation.\n!\n\nSpecifically, the PA changes by 30\u00b0 between days 91 and 128, after which it remains\nconstant for the next three epochs (Table 1). This result has a high degree of statistical\n\n!\nsignificance, and indicates that the scattering environment's morphology might be more\ncomplicated than that of a single, fixed geometry; we speculate on possible causes of this\nPA rotation below.\nThe link between long-soft \" -ray bursts (GRBs) and a subset of type Ic supernovae -specifically those with spectral lines indicating very high expansion velocities at early\n\n!, and successful models for GRBs require a jet-like explosion from\ntimes4 -- is now secure2,3\nenergetics considerations. While it is not clear that the same mechanism that generates the\nGRB is also responsible for exploding the star, the substantial early-time polarization that\nhas been measured for some of these events9, and more typical type Ic supernovae as well8,\nsupports the contention of a non-spherical explosion for 'stripped-envelope' supernovae.\nThe most thoroughly studied non-spherical explosion model is that of bipolar jets22, which\ndistribute radioactive 56Ni and other synthesized heavy elements (such as Fe) preferentially\nalong the polar axes; lighter elements produced by the progenitor star during its evolution\n(for example, O) are distributed near the equatorial plane in a disc-like structure23. This\n\n\f6\n\nmodel, in fact, has recently been successfully used to explain the emergence of doublepeaked oxygen line profiles in spectra of SN 2003jd, a type Ic supernova with high earlytime expansion velocities, obtained a year after explosion4.\nFor type II-P supernovae, the bipolar jet model predicts the radioactive 56Ni to be\nconfined to the inner regions, where it would ionize the surrounding material, produce a\nnon-spherical electron-scattering photosphere when exposed24, and plausibly produce\npolarization similar to that observed in SN 2004dj. In addition, it has been argued25 that a\nnon-spherical distribution of\n\n56\n\nNi can produce asymmetries in the H\u03b1 emission-line profile\n\nof type II-P supernovae during the nebular phase. Such asymmetries have, in fact, been\nrecently identified in late-time spectra of SN 2004dj, and are interpreted within the context\nof the bipolar jet model by ref. 19, which concludes that they are best explained by a\nbipolar distribution of 56Ni with the major axis oriented 30\u00b0 \u00b1 10\u00b0 to our line-of-sight. If\nwe adopt this viewing orientation, then our measured polarization peak of 0.56% places a\n\n!\nminimum departure from spherical symmetry of ~30% (axis ratio 10:7) for the inner\nregions of SN 2004dj from the axially symmetric, electron-scattering models of ref. 6.\nNaturally, if the electron-scattering atmosphere on day 91 has not yet reached the singlescattering limit, or is already below it, then the actual degree of asphericity is greater than\nour derived value.\nThe lack of polarization during the plateau fits comfortably within the bipolar jet\nmodel as well, as hydrodynamical simulations demonstrate that the shock propagates\nlaterally as it penetrates the inner regions23, and ultimately becomes completely spherical as\nit proceeds through the massive hydrogen envelope26. Because the shock propagation (and,\n\n\f7\n\nhence, 56Ni production) in the bipolar jet model is not purely radial in the inner regions, a\nrapidly but smoothly changing PA might be expected during the brief period (SN 2004dj\nfalling off the optical plateau) in which the 56Ni is being uncovered. This could explain the\nPA rotation observed for SN 2004dj between days 91 and 128, although opacity effects\nmay also play a role27. Additional examples, preferably with fine temporal sampling during\nthe critical phase at the end of the plateau, are needed to fully test these conjectures.\nAnalysis of pre-explosion images places the initial main-sequence mass of SN\n2004dj's progenitor at 12 solar masses18, in accord with masses inferred by similar studies\nof other type II-P supernovae (ref. 28 and references therein). Theory predicts that single\nstars that explode as type Ic supernovae must have initial main-sequence masses greater\nthan ~25 solar masses to undergo the extraordinary wind-driven mass loss required to\nremove their entire H/He envelopes prior to explosion29, and observations of Galactic\nWolf-Rayet stars support this conclusion30. The prompt appearance of substantial\npolarization in type Ic supernovae supports a non-spherical explosion model for these very\nmassive stars. The discovery of a non-spherical core in SN 2004dj suggests that a similar\nexplosion mechanism is at work in type II-P supernovae, and may, in fact, be inherent to\nthe core-collapse process, regardless of progenitor mass.\n\n1.

Continuum\npolarization level, p, and polarization position angle in the plane of the sky, \" , represent\nmeasurements made on the ISP-subtracted!data (see Fig. 1 legend) over the range 6800 \u2013 8200 \u00c5;\nin an effort to avoid statistical biases that exist at low polarization levels, the reported polarization is\n11\nthe median of the rotated Stokes parameter over this interval. The PA is determined as\n$1\n\" = 1/2 # tan (umed /qmed ) , where umed and qmed are the median\n! values of the Stokes parameters\nover this interval. The day 39 data were acquired using the double spectrograph with polarimeter on\nthe 5-m Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory. All other data were obtained with the Kast double\nspectrograph with polarimeter at the Cassegrain focus of the Shane 3-m telescope at Lick\nObservatory. The uncertainties\nin the\n!\n! Stokes parameters, which were then used to derive the\nuncertainties in p and \" , are derived as the quadrature sum of the Poisson error and a term\nreflecting our estimate of the random uncertainty in the overall, measured level of the Stokes\nparameters. For the Lick data, we set this term to be 0.04%, which is the average 1\u03c3 (s.d.) spread\nin the measured Stokes parameters of null standards observed on multiple nights (the same nights\nas the SN !\n2004dj data were obtained). For the day 39 data obtained at Palomar, we set this term\nequal to 0.15%, to account for the likely existence of some instrumental polarization in the data:\nwhile null standards at Lick were always found to be null to within 0.1%, the null standards\nobserved at Palomar on this night possessed measured polarizations of up to 0.25%, in a way that\ncould not be consistently modelled or removed from the data. Note that values for \" are ill-defined\nfor the day 39, 58, 72, and 271 data owing to the low polarization. On day 271, a final 2,367\nseconds of observations (a third complete set of four waveplate positions) were acquired but not\n!\n\n\f13\n\nincluded when forming the combined Stokes' parameters for the night's observations, as they were\ntaken under deteriorating weather conditions and with poor observing technique (object accidentally\nplaced near the edge of the slit), and are discrepant with the earlier data at the 4\u03c3 (s.d.) level. ND,\nnot determined.\n\nFigure 1. Intrinsic polarization of SN 2004dj during the photospheric phase with day since\nexplosion indicated. The flux spectrum is from day 91, with prominent line features labelled. The\n-1\nrecession velocity of 131 km s (NASA Extragalactic Database) has been removed from all data.\nThe polarization data have been corrected for an interstellar polarization (ISP) contribution, which\nwas derived by examining (1) the observed polarization in spectral regions dominated by the\nstrongest emission lines (that is, Na I D, H \" and the Ca II near-infrared triplet), which are believed\n16\nto be intrinsically unpolarized , and (2) the observed polarization at late times (that is, the nebular\nphase), when the electron-scattering optical depth of the atmosphere has dropped well below unity\nand the observed polarization at all wavelengths is largely due to ISP (see ref. 17 for a complete\ndiscussion). These complementary\n! approaches yield virtually identical results (to within 0.1%) for\nthe ISP estimation. For our data set, the final epoch is from day 271, at which point the ejecta are\nprobably not fully nebular and some small intrinsic polarization (<0.1%) may still exist. Examining\nthe temporal evolution in the Stokes q-u plane, we find the late-time polarization to be steadily\ndecreasing down to the level indicated by the earliest measurements made during the plateau\nphase, suggesting that these early epochs possess little to no intrinsic polarization (this is also\nsupported by the lack of any line features at these times). Thus, to derive the intrinsic polarization\nat all epochs, we fitted a low-order spline to the Stokes q and u spectra of the data from day 58\n(note that the data from day 39 have significantly lower signal-to-noise ratio than those obtained at\n\n\f14\n\nthe other plateau epochs), and then subtracted the result from the Stokes parameters obtained on\nall other epochs. This resulted in the removal of pISP \" 0.29% , \" ISP \" 20\u00b0 from the observed data.\n\n!\n\n!\n\n! !\n\nFigure 2. Light curve and continuum polarization of SN 2004dj. Polarization measures are from\nTable 1; error bars are 1\u03c3 (s.d.) statistical. Photometry is from data obtained with the 30-inch (0.8m) Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT) at Lick Observatory and the 60-inch (1.5-m)\ntelescope at Palomar Observatory. The dashed line represents the expected decline in polarization\n2\n( p = (t 0 /t) \" p0 , where t 0 = 91 days and p0 = 0.558% from Table 1) during the transition to the\nnebular phase due to the effects of diminishing electron scattering in optically thin, expanding\nejecta. Note that the age of SN 2004dj at discovery and, hence, the plateau duration, is not well\nconstrained by direct observation, as NGC 2403 had just emerged from solar conjunction and the\n18\nmost recent reported\npre-explosion image was taken over six months earlier . Our adopted\n!\nexplosion date of 2004 July 14 results from the spectral analysis of ref. 14, but we note that the\nlight-curve modeling of ref. 19 yields an explosion date 31 days earlier. If the earlier date were\nadopted, the estimated plateau duration would increase from ~70 to ~100 days.\n\n\f"}
