The time dilatation effect of special relativity is shown\nto manifestly respect this invariance. Consideration of the space-time Lorentz transformation\nwith arbitrary spatial coordinates shows that the spurious 'length contraction' and 'relativity\nof simultaneity' effects -the latter violating translational invariance- result from the use of a\ndifferent spatial coordinate system to describe each of two spatially separated clocks at rest in\na common inertial frame.\nPACS 03.30.+p\n\nTranslational invariance is a mathematical expression of the homogeneity of physical\nfree space \u2013the result of an experiment governed only by internal conditions does not\ndepend on where, in space, it is performed. A corollary is that the prediction of the result\nof any such experiment does not depend on the choice of spatial coordinates used for its\nphysical description. This is because moving the experiment to a different spatial position\nis mathematically equivalent to a change of the origins of coordinate axes ~x \u2192 ~x \u2212 ~x0 .\nIn this letter, it is demonstrated that the space-time Lorentz transformation (LT) -\nwhen correctly interpreted- respects translational invariance, as just defined. As will be\nexplained below, this is not the case in the conventional Einsteinian [1] interpretation of\nthe transformation.\nIt is instructive to first discuss the space transformation equation in the context of\nGalilean relativity. With a particular choice of coordinate axes, the Galilean space transformation for an object at rest in the inertial frame S', as observed in another such frame\nS, is:\nx\u2032 = x \u2212 vt = 0.\n(1)\nThis equation describes an object at rest at the origin of S' that moves with uniform\nvelocity, v, along the +ve x-axis in S. It is assumed that there is an array of synchronised\nclocks at rest in S and that t is the time recorded by any such clock. The spatial coordinate\nsystem in S is chosen so that x = 0 when t = 0. Introducing a more explicit notation and\narbitrary coordinate origins in S and S', Eq. (1) generalises to:\nx\u2032 (t) \u2212 x\u2032 (0) = x(t) \u2212 x(0) \u2212 vt = 0.\n1\n\n(2)\n\n\fThus x\u2032 (t) = x\u2032 (0) for all values of t, x(t) = x(0) for t = 0 and all values of v, while\nthe equation of motion of the object in S is given by the last member of (2). The\n'transformation equation' (2) is actually two separate and independent equations:\nx\u2032 (t) = x\u2032 (0),\nx(t) = x(0) + vt.\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nThe spatial LT corresponding to Eq. (2) is:\nx\u2032 (t) \u2212 x\u2032 (0) = \u03b3[x(t) \u2212 x(0) \u2212 vt] = 0.\n\n(5)\n\nThis,\np like (2), is equivalent to (3) and (4). In fact the multiplicative factor: \u03b3 \u2261\n1/ 1 \u2212 (v/c)2 in (5) may be replaced by a finite constant or an arbitrary finite function of v/c and the transformation will still be equivalent to (3) and (4). The spatial\ndescription of the moving object is therefore identical for the Galilean and Lorentz transformations. Note that the constants x\u2032 (0) and x(0) that specify the positions of the\norigins of coordinates in the frames S' and S respectively characterise a particular choice\nof coordinate systems. In order to correctly calculate the spatial separations of objects at\ndifferent positions it is essential to use the same coordinate system (i.e the same values\nof x\u2032 (0) and x(0)) to specify the positions of all the objects. As will be seen shortly, it is\nthe failure to do this that lies at the origin of the spurious 'length contraction' effect.\nThe temporal LT corresponding to (5) is:\nt\u2032 (t) = \u03b3[t \u2212\n\nv(x(t) \u2212 x(0))\n].\nc2\n\n(6)\n\nThe physical meaning of t\u2032 (t) is the time recorded by a local clock at the position of the\nobject in S' as observed, at time t, in the frame S. Because both t and x(t) appear on the\nright side of (6) one may think that t\u2032 (t) depends on both t and x(t). This is Einstein's\n'relativity of simultaneity' (RS) effect. However, (4) may be used to eliminate x(t) from\nthe right side of (6) to yield the time dilatation (TD) formula first derived, in this way,\ndirectly from the LT, by Einstein [1]:\nt = \u03b3t\u2032 (t)\n\n(7)\n\nSince no spatial coordinates appear in this equation, it manifestly respects translational\ninvariance. Also the clock in S' is 'system externally synchronised' [2] so that t\u2032 (0) = 0.\nKeeping the same general coordinate system and 'system external' synchronisation\nprocedure as used in (5) and (6) consider now two clocks, C1 ', C2 ' at rest in S' at x\u20321 (0)\nand x\u20322 (0). If t\u20321 (t) and t\u20322 (t) are the observed times of the clocks in S at time t, then the\nrelation (7) must hold for both of the clocks. In consequence,\n\u03b3t\u20321 (t) = \u03b3t\u20322 (t) = t\n\n(8)\n\nso that t\u20321 (t) = t\u20322 (t) -there is no RS effect. Indeed this follows from the the fact that t\u2032\nin Eq. (7), contrary to Eq. (6) without the additional condition (4), is a function only of\nt, not of t and x(t).\n\n2\n\n\fChoosing x1 (0) = x\u20321 (0) = 0 and x2 (0) = L, x\u20322 (0) = L\u2032 the LT describing the transformation of points on the world lines of C1 ' and C2 ' are:\nx\u20321 = \u03b3[x1 \u2212 vt1 ] = 0,\nvx1\nt\u20321 = \u03b3[t1 \u2212 2 ],\nc\nx\u20322 \u2212 L\u2032 = \u03b3[x2 \u2212 L \u2212 vt2 ] = 0,\nv(x2 \u2212 L)\n].\nt\u20322 = \u03b3[t2 \u2212\nc2\n\n(9)\n(10)\n(11)\n(12)\n\nConsider simultaneous events in S': t\u20321 = t\u20322 = t\u2032 . Combining (9),(10) and (11),(12) gives\nx1 (\u03b2) = vt1 = \u03b3\u03b2ct\u2032 ,\nt1 (\u03b2) = \u03b3t\u2032 ,\n\n(13)\n(14)\n\nx2 (\u03b2) \u2212 L = vt2 = \u03b3\u03b2ct\u2032 ,\nt2 (\u03b2) = \u03b3t\u2032\n\n(15)\n(16)\n\nwhere the \u03b2 dependence of the coordinates is explicitly indicated. The identity: \u03b3 2 \u2212\n\u03b3 2 \u03b2 2 \u2261 1 shows that (13),(14) and (15),(16) are parametric formulae for the hyperbolae\nin x \u2212 t space:\nc2 t1 (\u03b2)2 \u2212 x1 (\u03b2)2 = c2 (t\u2032 )2 = c2 t2 (\u03b2)2 \u2212 (x2 (\u03b2) \u2212 L)2 .\n\n(17)\n\nSince, from (14) and (16), t1 (\u03b2) = \u03b3t\u2032 = t2 (\u03b2), (17) requires that\nx2 (\u03b2) \u2212 x1 (\u03b2) = L.\n\n(18)\n\nBecause L = x2 (0), is a constant independent of \u03b2, (18) holds for arbitrary values of the\nlatter quantity. In particular, it holds when \u03b2 \u2192 0, x \u2192 x\u2032 , giving, in this case,\nx2 (0) \u2212 x1 (0) = x\u20322 \u2212 x\u20321 \u2261 L\u2032 = L.\n\n(19)\n\nThus the spatial separation of the clocks is a Lorentz-invariant quantity; -there is no\nrelativistic 'length contraction' (LC).\nHow the spurious and correlated RS and LC effects of conventional special relativity\narise will now be explained. Following Einstein [1] the choice x(0) = x\u2032 (0) = 0 is made\nin the general LT (5) and (6) to give :\nx\u2032 (t) = \u03b3[x(t) \u2212 vt] = 0,\nvx(t)\nt\u2032 (t) = \u03b3[t \u2212 2 ].\nc\n\n(20)\n(21)\n\nSince the TD relation (7) does not depend on the choice of spatial coordinate system, it\nholds also when (20) and (21) are used. If the clock C1 ' is placed at x\u20321 (t) = x\u20321 (0) = 0,\nit is, according to (20) and (21), synchronised so that t\u20321 (t = 0) = 0. The 'LC effect' is\nderived by substituting the coordinates of the clock C2 ', placed at x\u20322 (t) = x\u20322 (0) = L\u2032\nin the first member of space transformation equation (20) and setting t = 0. This\nprocedure is aleady in contradiction with the last member of (20) since it is assumed,\n3\n\n\fin making this subsitution, that L\u2032 6= 0. After the above substitution in (20), and since\nx\u20321 (0) = x1 (0) = 0, the following equation may be derived:\nx\u20322 (0) \u2212 x\u20321 (0) = L\u2032 = \u03b3[x2 (0) \u2212 x1 (0)] = \u03b3L.\n\n(22)\n\nThis is the 'LC effect'. However, the assumption on which (22) is based, x\u20321 (0) = x1 (0) =\n0, is inconsistent with the formula from which (22) is derived:\nx\u20322 (t) = L\u2032 = \u03b3[x2 (t) \u2212 vt] 6= 0\nor\nx\u20322 (t) \u2212 L\u2032 = \u03b3[x2 (t) \u2212\n\nL\u2032\n\u2212 vt] = 0\n\u03b3\n\n(23)\n\n(24)\n\nComparing (24) with the general formula (5) requires that\nx\u20322 (0) = x\u2032 (0) = L\u2032 ,\nx\u2032 (0)\nL\u2032\n=\n.\nx2 (0) = x(0) =\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\n\n(25)\n(26)\n\nThese equations imply that in (23) a different coordinate system is used in the frame S\nto specifiy the position of C2 ' to the one used to specify the position of C1 ' in Eqs. (20)\nand (21) where x\u20321 (0) = x1 (0) = 0. In fact, with the coordinate system corresponding to\n(23), x2 (0) = L\u2032 /\u03b3 and it follows that x1 (0) is not zero but rather\nx1 (0) = x2 (0) \u2212 L = L\u2032 /\u03b3 \u2212 L.\nThe LT for C1 ' and C2 ', using the coordinate systems defined by (25) and (26), are\ntherefore:\nx\u20321 (t) = \u03b3[x1 (t) \u2212 L\u2032 /\u03b3 + L \u2212 vt] = 0,\nv(x1 (t) \u2212 L\u2032 /\u03b3 + L)\n],\nt\u20321 (t) = \u03b3[t \u2212\nc2\nx\u20322 (t) \u2212 L\u2032 = \u03b3[x2 (t) \u2212 L\u2032 /\u03b3 \u2212 vt] = 0,\nv(x2 (t) \u2212 L\u2032 /\u03b3)\nt\u20322 (t) = \u03b3[t \u2212\n].\nc2\n\n(27)\n(28)\n(29)\n(30)\n\nEqs. (27) and (29) give\nx1 (t) = L\u2032 /\u03b3 \u2212 L + vt,\n\n(31)\n\n\u2032\n\n(32)\n\nx2 (t) \u2212 x1 (t) = L.\n\n(33)\n\nx\u20321 (t) + L\u2032 = \u03b3[x1 (t) + L \u2212 vt].\n\n(34)\n\nx2 (t) = L /\u03b3 + vt\nso that\nTransposing (27) gives\nTaking the limit v \u2192 0, \u03b3 \u2192 1, x \u2192 x\u2032 in (34) gives\nx\u20321 (t) + L\u2032 = x\u20321 (t) + L\n4\n\n(35)\n\n\fso that L = L\u2032 , as in (19) above, and in contradiction with the 'LC effect' of (22).\nIt can be seen that the spurious 'LC effect' of (22) is a consequence of using different\ncoordinate systems in the frame S to describe the two clocks: x1 (0) = x\u20321 (0) = 0 for C1 '\nand x2 (0) = x\u20322 (0)/\u03b3 = L\u2032 /\u03b3 for C2 '. When the latter system is used for both clocks, as\nin (27)-(30), the LC effect does not occur.\nIf it is incorrectly assumed that x(0) = 0 in (6), applied to the clock C2 ', when the\ncondition (23) is satisfied, it is found, instead of (30) that\nt\u20322 (t, L\u2032 ) =\n\nvL\u2032\nt\nt\n\u2212 2 6= t\u20321 (t) =\n\u03b3\nc\n\u03b3\n\n(36)\n\nin contradiction to Eq. (8) above, and violating translational invariance The spurious\ndependence of t\u20322 on L\u2032 in Eq. (36) is Einstein's RS effect.\nSimilar conclusions to those of the present letter have been obtained elsewhere, by a\ncareful study of clock synchronisation procedures [3, 4].\nTo date, there is no experimental verification of the RS or LC effects of conventional\nspecial relativity theory [3], which are claimed to be spurious in the present letter. However the existence (or not) of the O(v/c) RS effect of Eq. (34) is easily tested using modern\nexperimental techniques. Two experiments, using satellites in low Earth orbit, have been\nproposed to perform such a test [5].\n\nReferences\n[1] A.Einstein, Annalen der Physik 17, 891 (1905).\nEnglish translation by W.Perrett and G.B.Jeffery in 'The Principle of Relativity'\n(Dover, New York, 1952) P37, or in 'Einstein's Miraculous Year' (Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, 1998) P123.\n[2] R.Mansouri and R.U.Sexl, Gen.
