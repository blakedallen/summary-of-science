To investigate the clinical and\nprognostic significance of fractal dimension and detrended fluctuation\nanalysis, two different groups were studied, group of patients with stable\nangina pectoris without previous myocardial infarction, and age-matched\nhealthy controls. The fractal dimension of the RR series was determined\nusing the rescaled range (R/S) analysis technique. To quantify fractal\nlonge-range-correlation properties of heart rate variability, the detrended\nfluctuation analysis (DFA) technique was used. The heart rate variability was characterized by a scaling exponent \u03b1, separately for short-term\n(< 11 beats) and for long-term (> 11 beats) time scales. The results of\ndata sets show the existence of crossover phenomena between short-time\nscales. In patients with stable angina pectoris the short-term fractal scaling exponent (\u03b11 ) was significantly lower (0.95 \u00b1 0.05 vs. 1.08 \u00b1 0.06; p\n< 0.05), while there were no differences in the long-term fractal scaling\nexponent (\u03b12 )(1.37 \u00b1 0.26 vs. 1.39 \u00b1 0.04; p<0.05). The patients with\nstable angina pectoris also had higher fractal dimension than a healthy\ncontrol group (p < 0.05). The short-time scaling exponent and fractal\ndimension are better than other heart rate variability parametars in differentiating patients with stable angina pectoris from healthy subjects.\nDynamic analysis may thus complement traditional analysis in detecting\naltered heart rate behaviour.\n1\n\nPresented at Computers in Cardiology, September 23-26, 2001 - Rotterdam, The\nNetherlands\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nHeart rate variability (HRV) [1, 2] reflects the modulation of the cardiac function\nby autonomic and other physiological systems, and its measurements from ambulantory electrocardiography (ECG) recordings during an exercise ECG test\nmay be a useful method for both clinical and scientific purposes.\nTraditional linear statistical measures provide limited information about\nHRV, because non-linear mechanisms may also be involved in the genesis of\nHR dynamics. A number of new methods have recently been developed to\nquantify complex heart rate dynamics. They may uncover abnormalities in the\ntime series data, which are not apparent when using conventional linear statistical methods. This study tested the hypothesis that fractal measurements of\nHRV are altered in patients with stable angina pectoris [3, 4].\n\n2\n2.1\n\nMethods\nPatients\n\nTwenty five consecutive patients with stable angina pectoris and without previous myocardial infarction were included in the analysis after the history of\nchest pain and non-invasive cardiovascular diagnostic measurements (ECG at\nrest, echocardiography, 24 hours ECG, vectorcardiography, exercise ECG test\nand laboratory coronary risk factors measurements) with ECG evidence of ischemic STsegment depression (> 0.1 mV) during an exercise test. They were 57\n\u00b1 6 years old, 12 male. No cardiac medication was allowed on the day of testing, and b - blocking therapy was withdrawn at least 7 days before and calcium\nantagonists at least 2 days before. Patients with anginal chest pain, silent ischemic ST-segment depression during the 24 hour ECG recording and diabetes\nmellitus were excluded. The control group consisted of 20 randomly selected age\nmatched (mean age 58 \u00b1 8 years), and sex matched (11 male) healthy subjects.\nAfter a complete non-invasive eexamination and their medical history all patients revealed no cardiovascular disease or use of medication. All controls had\nnormal ECG at rest, echocardiographic data (M-mode, 2D dimensional and\nDoppler echocardiography), normal arterial blood pressure and fasting blood\nglucose. Subjects with evidence of ischemic ST-segment depression during the\nexercise ECG test or the 24 hour ECG recording were not included. An exercise\nECG on all subjects was obtained using a symptom or ECG changes limited\n2\n\n\ftest, increasing the workload in a controlled manner. A horizontal or downsloping ST-segment depression of > 0. mV occurring 0.08 seconds after the J point\nwas considered to be of ischemic origin.\n\n2.2\n\nAnalysis of HRV\n\nSeries of RR intervals were obtained from high resolution ECG (sampling frequency 1000 Hz), and the recording time scale during the exercise ECG test was\napproximately about 1500 beats. The ECG data were digitized by the Vawebook 512 (Iotech. Cal. USA), and transferred to a computer for analysis. The\nRR interval series was passed through a filter that eliminated noise, artifacts\nand premature beats. All RR interval series were first edited automatically,\nafter which careful manual editing was performed by visual inspection of each\nRR interval. After this, all questionable portions were excluded manually, and\nonly segments with > 85 % sinus beats were included in the final analysis.\nThe fractal dimension of the RR interval series was determined by the\n\"Rescaled range\" (R/S) analysis [5]: R(n)/S(n) \u223c nH , where H is the Hurst's\nexponent, an important parameter used to characterize the time series. H \u223c\nlog(R/S)/log(n) where n is the length of the time box.\nIf the Hurst exponent is approximately about 0.5, it represents an ordinary\nrandom walk or Brownian motion. In the cases where H is < 0.5, it means\nnegative correlation between the increments (antipersistent time series) and if\nit is > 0.5, it means positive correlation between the increments (persistent time\nseries which are plentiful in nature).\nThe Hurst exponent is related to the fractal dimension (FD): H = E + 1 +\nFD, where E is the Euclidean.dimension ( E = 0 for point, 1 for line and 2 for\nsurface). The relation between H and FD of the graph of a random fractal is\nFD = 2H for one dimensional signal. While H vary from 0 to 1, FD decreases\nfrom 2 to 1.\nThe Hursts exponent as well as the fractal dimension were determined for\nthe whole time series during the exercise ECG, and also separately for each\nprogram of exercise including half a minute baseline ECG before the exercise\nand six minutes of relaxation after the exercise (Figs.1 and 2).\nTo quantify fractal long-range correlation properties of HRV, the detrended\nfluctuation analysis (DFA) technique [6], which is a modified root-mean-square\n(rms) analysis of a random walk, was used. The method quantifies the presence\nor absence of fractal long-range correlation properties. The rms fluctuation of\n\n3\n\n\fintegrated and detrended time series is calculated by the formula\nF (n) =\n\nv\nu\nu\nt\n\nN\n1 X\n[y(k) \u2212 yn (k)]2 ,\nN k=1\n\nwhere\ny(k) =\n\nk\nX\n\n(R(i) \u2212 R)\n\ni=1\n\nand yn (k) is the regression line through the data y(i) in the box of length n. This\ncomputation is repeated over all time scales (box sizes n) in order to characterize\nthe relationship between F(n), the average fluctuation, as a function of box size.\nTypically, F (n) will increase with box size n. A linear relationship in a log\u2013log\nplot indicates the presence of power law (fractal) scaling. In this study, HRV\nwas characterized by a scaling exponent \u03b1, the slope of the linear relationship\nbetween log F(n) and log n, separately for short-term (< 11 beats, \u03b11 ), and\nlong-term (> 11 beats, \u03b12 ) fluctuations in the RR series data (Fig.3).\n\n2.3\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nResults are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). The p value < 0.05\nwas considered significant.\n\n3\n\nResults\n\nThe baseline clinical and heart rate variables of healthy controls and patients\nwith stable angina pectoris are listed in Table 1. There were no differences\nobserved in conventional statistical linear measures of the HRV (average RR\nintervals and SDNN in the time domain and LF/HF ratio in frequent domain).\nThe results of exercise data sets show the existence of crossover phenomena\nbetween short-time scales when using the DFA method. A significant difference\nwas found between patients with stable angina pectoris and healthy controls\nin short-time scales (0.95 \u00b1 0.05 vs. 1.08 \u00b1 0.06) as can be seen in Figure 3.\nHowever there were no significant differences in long-term series. The fractal\ndimension was significantly higher in patients with stable angina pectoris.\nThe main findings of this study are compared with healthy controls. Because\nof a relatively small patient population, the results of this study do not allow\nus to draw conclusions regarding the lack of the prognostic value of HRV in\n4\n\n\fClinical data (n=45):\nAge (yrs)\nMen/women\nECG at rest (freq.)\nVPCs/hour\nLV ejection fraction(%)\nE/A wave\nExercise ECG data:\nAverage RR interval (ms)\nSDNN (ms)\nLF/HF ratio\nHurst's exponent\nFractal dimension\n\u03b11\n\u03b12\n* p value < 0.05\n\nHealthy Controls (n=20) Patients with SAP (n= 25)\n58 \u00b1 8\n57 \u00b1 6\n11/9\n12/13\n74\n81\n3 \u00b1 0.7\n4 \u00b1 2.7\n71 \u00b1 6\n63 \u00b1 9\n1.4 \u00b1 0.2\n0.8 \u00b1 0.2\n874 \u00b1 108\n149 \u00b1 41\n3.2 \u00b1 1.5\n0.81 \u00b1 0.05\n1.19 \u00b1 0.07\n1.08 \u00b1 0.06\n1.39 \u00b1 0.04\n\n856 \u00b1 114\n139 \u00b1 40\n3.5 \u00b1 1.7\n0.64 \u00b1 0.07 *\n1.36 \u00b1 0.09 *\n0.95 \u00b1 0.05 *\n1.37 \u00b1 0.26\n\nTable 1: The clinical and heart rate variables of subjects in the study\ntraditional measurements, but do give preliminary information on the usefulness\nof fractal analysis methods in risk stratification of patients with stable CHD.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nPatients with stable angina pectoris had loss normal fractal characteristics in\nheart rate variability estimated by non-linear dynamic measures of heart rate\nbehaviour. The measurement of a short-term fractal scaling exponent gives\ncomplementary information on abnormal HR behaviour in patients with SAP\nin relation to other standard measurements. The present study shows that\nnormal fractal properties of RR interval dynamics are altered in patients with\nSAP. Dynamic analysis of HRV gives independent information that probably\ncannot be detected by the traditional linear analysis technique. Healthy subjects\nhave a distinct circadian rhythm of HRV, but this rhythm seems to be blunted\nin coronary heart disease (CHD) patients. Fractal correlation properties and\nfractal dimension in this study may reflect an altered neuroanatomic interaction\nthat may predispose patients to the development of CHD. Further studies in\na larger population will be needed to further define the clinical utility of new\n5\n\n\ffractal measurements of HRV for risk stratification in patients with CHD.\n\nReferences\n[1] Huikuri H.V.
