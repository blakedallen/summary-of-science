Invisibility cloaking appeals to laymen and scientists alike because\na phenomenon long believed to be impossible has suddenly come into reach. However,\nthe holy grail of a three-dimensional (3D) cloak for visible unpolarized light has not been\naccomplished so far. Direct laser writing optical lithography (DLW), that has been\nsuccessfully used to fabricate 3D structures (1), \"just\" has to be improved by a bit more\nthan a factor of two in all spatial directions to achieve that goal. Yet, improving optical\nlithography already operated at the diffraction limit by that factor is not a minor task at\nall.\n\nHere, we accomplish this step by employing stimulated-emission-depletion inspired\nDLW (STED-DLW), with conceptually diffraction-unlimited axial and lateral resolution.\n\nBy transferring concepts from stimulated-emission-depletion (STED) fluorescence\nmicroscopy (2) to DLW, the diffraction barrier has recently started to erode (3-5). In\nessence, one laser serves as a pencil of light in three dimensions and a second laser serves\nas an eraser, allowing for \"erasing\" the edges of written lines, hence reducing the feature\nsizes. However, transferring this advance to complex free-standing 3D nanostructures has\nnot been demonstrated so far. Furthermore, it is most crucial to improve the axial\n\n\fresolution in DLW, since it has been nearly three times worse than the lateral resolution\nfor relevant lens numerical apertures of NA=1.4, hence limiting the overall resolution of\n3D DLW.\n\nOur approach is illustrated in Fig. 1A. As usual, optical femtosecond pulses centered at\naround 810-nm wavelength are tightly focused by a microscope objective with NA=1.4\nto polymerize a photoresist within the focal volume via two-photon absorption. By using\na home-made optical phase-mask (see SOM), a continuous-wave 532-nm wavelength\n\"eraser\" beam is shaped such that the elongated red focal volume is effectively reduced to\nthe desired more spherical exposure volume. We have designed a photoresist (see SOM)\nfollowing our spirit (5) that the anticipated stimulated emission depletion is only possible\nfor reasonably efficient spontaneous emission. In contrast to our previous choice (5), the\nphotoinitiator used here offers a better ratio between depletion efficiency and undesired\nabsorption of the continuous-wave depletion laser (which limits resolution). Importantly,\nwe presently see no fundamental optical limitation of our approach in terms of obtainable\nminimum feature sizes in three dimensions \u2013 just like in STED microscopy.\n\nWe have fabricated a number of carpet cloak structures with this type of optical\nlithography. In a nutshell, the carpet cloak (1,6) bends light in such a way that a bump in\na metallic carpet appears to be flat. Hence, objects hidden underneath the bump become\ninvisible. To do so, the local phase velocity of light (thus the refractive index) has to be\ntailored following the mathematics of transformation optics. The required refractive\nindex distribution can be realized by adjusting the local volume filling fraction of a\n\n\fwoodpile photonic crystal. In our 2010 experimental work (1), we have succeeded in\nfabricating such a device with a rod spacing of a=800 nm. Here, to allow for direct\ncomparison, we fabricate a miniaturized version of the 3D carpet cloak with a=350 nm.\nDue to the scalability of the Maxwell equations, the operation wavelength is expected to\nscale from the lower limit of about 1.5 \u03bcm in Ref.(1) down to\n1.5 \u03bcm \u00d7 350/800 = 0.7 \u03bcm, i.e., to visible red light. Corresponding structures, control\nexperiments, and successful cloaking results are shown in Fig. 1B, C, and D,\nrespectively.\n\nIn a broader context, the special example of a polarization-independent invisibility cloak\nat visible wavelengths demonstrated here raises hopes that diffraction-unlimited optical\nlithography may truly become the 3D analogue of 2D electron-beam lithography, which\nhas served as a workhorse for the entire field of (planar) nanotechnology for many years.\n\n\fReferences:\n1.

In sharp contrast, the stripes\ndisappear for the cloaking structure (bottom).\n\n\fSupporting Online Material\nOur home-made photoresist consists of pentaerythritol tetraacrylate (Sigma Aldrich) and\n0.25% wt 7-diethylamino-3-thenoylcoumarin (Exciton). The former contains 350 ppm\nmonomethyl ether hydroquinone as inhibitor. The molar extinction coefficient of the\nphotoinitiator is 35,000 l mol-1 cm-1 (Exciton data sheet), which is comparable to state-ofthe-art dyes, e.g., Atto425 with 45,000 l mol-1 cm-1 (ATTO-TEC GmbH). The crosssection for stimulated emission is proportional to these values. Measured absorbance and\nphotoluminescence spectra of our photoinitiator in ethanol solution are shown in Fig. S1.\nThis figure also shows the measured depletion of photoluminescence with increasing\npower of the depletion laser (without phase mask, i.e., for a Gaussian depletion focus).\nThis observation is consistent with stimulated emission being the underlying depletion\nmechanism. However, other mechanisms leading to photoinduced reversible\npolymerization suppression could contribute as well and are also expected to lead to axial\nand lateral resolution improvement. Hence, they serve the spirit of STED-DLW. After\nexposure, the photoresist structures are developed in 2-propanol and dried super-critically\nwith CO2 (Leica EM CPD030).\n\nThe special depletion focus in Fig. 1A is accomplished by a home-made phase mask. It\nconsists of a 430-nm high cylinder (photoresist SU-8, MicroChem) with refractive index\nn=1.62 at 532-nm wavelength on a glass substrate. This arrangement introduces a 180degrees phase shift in the center of the continuous-wave circularly polarized collimated\nbeam. The phase-mask plane is imaged onto the entrance pupil of the microscope\nobjective (Leica HCX PL APO, NA=1.4) of the DLW system such that the central area\n\n\foccupies about 50 % of the entrance pupil area. The focal intensity distributions of the\nred (Spectra Physics, Mai Tai HP) and green (Spectra Physics, Millennia Xs) beams in\nFig. 1A are measured by scanning a single 100-nm diameter gold bead through the focus\nand recording the back-scattered light intensity. These intensity distributions show that\nthe green depletion profile not only reduces the red profile along the axial direction, but\nalso comprises a ring in the focal plane, improving the lateral resolution.\n\nIn the fabrication process, the femtosecond excitation (10-mW average power) and\ncontinuous-wave depletion (50 mW) lasers are chopped at 3% duty cycle (4-kHz\nfrequency). The local filling fraction of the woodpile photonic crystal is controlled by\nvarying the excitation power.\n\nTo enhance the visibility of details in Figure 1B, we have overlaid two images with\ndifferent brightness (high dynamic range (HDR) image). The gold parts were colored in\nyellow, the polymer parts in blue.\n\nThe oblique-view (54-degrees tilt with respect to surface normal) electron micrograph of\na focused-ion-beam cut of a cloaking structure shown in Fig. S1 reveals the cloak's\ninterior. The woodpile rod spacing is a=350 nm. This value has never been achieved\nbefore by DLW without depletion beam. As a control experiment, we have switched off\nthe green depletion laser, while keeping all other parameters fixed. Under these\nconditions, we have not even found any open polymer nanostructure for any power of the\nred excitation beam. The overall design dimensions of the cloaking structure in Fig. 1B\n\n\fare 50 \u03bcm \u00d7 20 \u03bcm \u00d7 5 \u03bcm. The full width of the cos2-shaped bump is 6 \u03bcm, its height is\n0.5 \u03bcm. After completing optical lithography, the samples are coated with a 100-nm thick\ngold film in a sputter chamber (Cressington 108 auto).\n\nFig. S1.
