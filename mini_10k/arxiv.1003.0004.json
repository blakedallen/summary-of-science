Unlike weak lensing by massive galaxy clusters, where the only\nimportant lens in the problem is the cluster itself, galaxy-galaxy lensing involves multiple\nweak deflections. For example, it is common for a distant source galaxy at redshift zs to\nbe weakly lensed by a more nearby galaxy at redshift zl1 , and for both of these galaxies to\nthen be lensed by another (even more nearby) galaxy at redshift zl2 . Thus, the galaxy with\nredshift zl1 serves simultaneously as a lens for the galaxy at zs and a source for the galaxy\nat zl2 . In addition, the galaxy at zs is lensed by two independent foreground galaxies. The\nimportance of such multiple deflections in galaxy-galaxy lensing was first noted by Brainerd\net al. (1996; hereafter BBS). Since the work of BBS, galaxy-galaxy lensing has been detected\nwith impressively high statistical significance by a number of different groups. This has\nenabled constraints to be placed on the nature of the dark matter halos that surround the\nlens galaxies as well as the bias between mass and light in the universe (see, e.g., Fischer et\nal. 2000; Guzik & Seljak 2002; Hoekstra et al. 2004, 2005; Sheldon et al. 2004; Heymans et\nal. 2006; Kleinheinrich et al. 2006; Mandelbaum et al. 2006ab; Limousin et al. 2007; Parker\net al. 2007; Natarajan et al. 2009; Tian et al. 2009 ).\nThe purpose of the present investigation is to: (i) quantify the frequency of multiple\nweak lensing deflections in a relatively deep galaxy-galaxy lensing data set, (ii) determine\nthe effect of multiple deflections on the net shear for distant source galaxies that have been\nweakly lensed by foreground galaxies, and (iii) demonstrate that galaxy-galaxy lensing alone\nmay contribute a substantial amount to the \"cosmic shear\" signal on small angular scales. To\ndo this, theoretical shear fields are constructed using a set of observed galaxies with known\nredshifts and known rest-frame blue luminosities. A simple halo model is used to assign\nmasses to the observed galaxies and Monte Carlo simulations are then used to lens various\ntheoretical source galaxy distributions by the observed galaxies. Theoretical shear fields for\nfull, multiple-deflection calculations are computed; i.e., each source galaxy in the simulation\nis lensed by all foreground galaxies. In addition, theoretical shear fields for naive, singledeflection calculations (where the closest lens on the sky is assumed to be the only lens) are\nalso computed. The results of the single-deflection calculations are compared to those of the\nfull, multiple-deflection calculations in order to assess the effects of multiple deflections in\ngalaxy-galaxy lensing. Throughout, the weak lensing of an entire source galaxy by a single\nforeground lens galaxy will be referred to as a \"deflection\".\nThe paper is organized as follows. The Monte Carlo simulations of galaxy-galaxy lensing\nare described in Section 2, the frequency of multiple weak deflections in galaxy-galaxy lensing\nis computed in Section 3, the effects of multiple weak deflections on the galaxy-galaxy lensing\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nshear are computed in Section 4, the contribution of galaxy-galaxy lensing to cosmic shear\nis computed in Section 5, and a discussion of cosmic variance in relation to the field size in\npresented in Section 6. The conclusions are summarized in Section 7.\n\n2.\n\nMonte Carlo Simulations of Galaxy-Galaxy Lensing\n\nTo investigate the frequency and effects of multiple weak deflections in galaxy-galaxy\nlensing, Monte Carlo simulations are constructed. The lens galaxies in the Monte Carlo\nsimulations are relatively bright galaxies that are contained within a circle of radius 4 arcmin,\ncentered on the Hubble Deep Field North (HDF-N) (Williams et al. 1996). This region of sky\nwas the subject of a deep redshift survey (Cohen et al. 1996; Steidel et al. 1996; Lowenthal et\nal. 1997; Phillips et al. 1997; Cohen et al. 2000) as well as an extensive multicolor photometric\ninvestigation (Hogg et al. 2000). As a result, both the redshifts (Cohen et al. 2000, Tables 2A\nand 2B) and rest-frame blue luminosities, LB (Cohen 2001, Table 1), of 590 galaxies in this\nregion of the sky are known. For the simulations, then, the locations of the lenses in redshift\nspace are known very accurately, and the relative strengths of the different lenses can be\ninferred quite well from their relative luminosities. Therefore, it is possible to make detailed\ntheoretical predictions for the weak galaxy-galaxy lensing shear field that should be expected\nin this region of sky.\nFor simplicity, the dark matter halos of the lens galaxies are taken to have a mass density\ngiven by\n\u03c3v2 s2\n\u03c1(r) =\n,\n(1)\n2\u03c0Gr 2 (r 2 + s2 )\nwhere \u03c3v is the velocity dispersion of the halo, G is Newton's constant, and s is a characteristic halo radius (see e.g., BBS; Hudson et al. 1998; Fischer et al. 2000; Hoekstra et al.\n2004). It is then convenient to scale the depths of the potential wells of lens galaxies with\ndiffering luminosities, LB , according to a Tully-Fisher or Faber-Jackson type of relation\n\u03c3v\n=\n\u03c3v\u2217\n\n\u0012\n\nLB\nL\u2217B\n\n\u00131/4\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c3v\u2217 is the velocity dispersion of the halo of a lens galaxy with rest-frame blue luminosity\nL\u2217B . Again for simplicity, it is assumed that the mass-to-light ratio of a galaxy is constant\nindependent of its luminosity. Therefore, the characteristic radii of the halos of galaxies with\nLB 6= L\u2217B scale with the radii of the halos of L\u2217B galaxies as\ns\n=\ns\u2217\n\n\u0012\n\nLB\nL\u2217B\n\n\u00131/2\n\n.\n\n(3)\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nUnder these assumptions, then, the mass of the halo of an L\u2217B galaxy is given by\nM\u2217 =\n\n\u03c0s\u2217 (\u03c3v\u2217 )2\nG\n\nand the deflection of a light ray emanating from a source galaxy is given by\n\u0001 i\n4\u03c0\u03c3v2 Dls h\n2 1/2\n\u03b1(X) =\n.\n1\n+\nX\n\u2212\n1\n+\nX\nDs Xc2\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\nHere Ds is the angular diameter distance between the observer and the source, Dls is the\nangular diameter distance between the lens and the source, and X is the ratio of the impact\nparameter of the light ray and the characteristic radius, s, of the lens (i.e., X \u2261 R/s; see\nBBS).\nIt is worth noting that galaxy-galaxy lensing has, of course, been detected in the HDFN (e.g., dell'Antonio & Tyson 1996; Hudson et al. 1998); however due to the very small\nnumber of galaxies in the HDF-N, the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal can only be detected with\nrelatively low significance. In particular, there are simply too few actual source galaxies to\ncarry out a detailed investigation of the effects of multiple deflections using only the observed\nsources. It is for this reason that Monte Carlo simulations are adopted here.\nThe completeness limits of the redshift survey are, unfortunately, different for the HDFN itself and the surrounding area of the sky, the survey being deeper in the region of the HDFN. This gives rise to a somewhat different redshift distribution for galaxies with measured\nredshifts in the center of the field versus galaxies with measured redshifts in the outer region\nof the field. In order to make an accurate prediction for the theoretical shear field, it is\nimportant that the redshift completeness limit for the lenses in the Monte Carlo simulations\nbe uniform across the field. Therefore, a conservative completeness limit of R = 23 is imposed\nhere, and the lenses in the Monte Carlo simulations consist of the 427 galaxies with R \u2264 23 in\nCohen et al. (2000) and Cohen (2001) for which spectroscopic redshifts and rest-frame blue\nluminosities are known. The median redshift of the lens galaxies is therefore zmed = 0.55.\nTwo approaches are taken to model the redshifts of the source galaxy population: (i)\nsource galaxies are simply placed in a single plane of redshift zs and (ii) source galaxies are\ndistributed in redshift space according to the observed redshift distribution of faint galaxies.\nThe first approach allows an investigation of the frequency of multiple weak deflections as\na function of discrete source redshift. The second approach demonstrates the overall effect\nthat would be expected to occur in a deep galaxy-galaxy lensing data set.\nEach Monte Carlo simulation includes 10 million source galaxies that are assigned random positions (RA and DEC) within a circle of radius 2.5 arcminutes, centered on the\nHDF-N. The sources are contained within a smaller area than the lenses because, as will\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nbe shown below, about 10% of the time the most important lens for a given source may\nbe more than an arcminute away. By restricting the sources to a smaller area than the\nlenses, edge effects (in which sources are not properly lensed by all foreground galaxies) are\navoided. In simulations where the sources are restricted to a single plane in redshift space,\neach source is assigned the identical redshift, zs . In simulations where the sources are broadly\ndistributed in redshift space, the apparent magnitudes of the sources are taken to be in the\nrange 19 < I < 25, and the number of sources per unit magnitude is chosen to match the\nobserved number counts in the I-band (e.g., Smail et al. 1995). These sources are assumed\nto follow a redshift distribution of the form\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03b2z 2 exp \u2212(z/z0 )\u03b2\nP (z|I) =\n,\n(6)\n\u0393(3/\u03b2)z03\nwhich is in good agreement with the redshift surveys of LeF\u00e8vre et al. (1996) and LeF\u00e8vre\net al. (2004). Assuming \u03b2 = 1.5 and extrapolating the results of LeF\u00e8vre et al. (2004) to a\nsample of galaxies with 19 < I < 25 yields\nz0 = 0.8 [0.86 + 0.15(I \u2212 23.35)]\n\n(7)\n\n(see, e.g., BBS). The median redshift of the sources in this case is zmed = 0.96.\nThroughout, we will consider only the weak lensing regime. That is, we will restrict\nour analysis to the case that the surface mass density of the lenses is very much less than\nDs\nc2\n), the deflection\nthe critical surface mass density for strong lensing (\u03a3(\u03b8) << \u03a3c \u2261 4\u03c0G\nDd Dls\nangle, \u03b1, the modulus of the shear, \u03b3, and the convergence, \u03ba, are all small, and \u03b3 \u2243 \u03ba.\nGiven that the physical size of each lens is very much smaller than the distances between\nthe observer, lens, and source, we will adopt the standard thin lens approximation (e.g.,\nBlandford & Narayan 1986; Schneider et al. 1992). Further, we will perform all calculations\nin the framework of the Born approximation, in which integrations are performed along an\nundeflected light ray. This standard weak lensing formalism is valid even in the limit of\nmultiple weak deflections (e.g., Bartelmann & Schneider 2001). Indeed, investigations into\nthe degree to which the Born approximation may affect predictions of cosmic shear (where\nthe weak lenses consist of all the mass along the line of sight), have shown that corrections\ndue to the Born approximation are two to three orders of magnitude smaller than the cosmic\nshear signal itself (e.g., Cooray & Hu 2001; Hilbert et al. 2009).\nFor each Monte Carlo simulation, specific values of the velocity dispersion, \u03c3v\u2217 , and characteristic radius, s\u2217 , for L\u2217B galaxies are chosen. Velocity dispersions, \u03c3v , and characteristic\nradii, s, are then assigned to each lens galaxy based upon the above scaling relations. The\nredshifts of the lenses, zl , are taken to be the observed spectroscopic redshifts, and the positions of the lenses in the field (RA and DEC) are taken to be the observed positions on\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nthe sky. The Monte Carlo simulation then proceeds by computing the weak lensing shear,\n~\u03b3 , that is induced as the light rays emanating from the background sources encounter the\nforeground lenses. In the case of single-deflection calculations, the lensing of each source is\ncomputed solely for the lens which is nearest to the source in projection on the sky. That\nis, the \"closest\" lenses are the only lenses that are used in the single deflection calculations,\nand the resulting shear for each source is simply the shear induced by the closest lens. In\nthe case of full, multiple-deflection calculations, the lensing of each source by all foreground\nlenses is computed. The resulting shear for each source is then the net shear due to all\nforeground lenses. This is straightforward to compute in the weak lensing regime since all\nweak deflections may be considered to be independent (e.g., Bartelmann & Schneider 2001).\nEach source galaxy is assigned a random intrinsic position angle and an intrinsic ellipticity that is drawn at random from the observed ellipticity distribution of the HDF-N\ngalaxies. The intrinsic shape parameters of the source galaxies are then given by\n\u03c7\n~ in = \u01ebin e2i\u03c6in\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u01ebin = (a \u2212 b)/(a + b) is the intrinsic ellipticity of the source and \u03c6in is its intrinsic\nposition angle. Since we are dealing only with the weak lensing regime, the final image shape\nof each source galaxy in the multiple-deflection calculations is given by\nlens\n\u03c7\n~f = \u03c7\n~ in + \u03a3N\n\u03b3j\nj=1 ~\n\n(9)\n\nwhere ~\u03b3j is the shear induced by foreground lens galaxy, j. In the case of the full, multipledeflection calculations, the net shear due to all lenses with zl < zs is used to obtain ~\u03b3f\nfor each source galaxy. In the case of the single deflection calculations, the sum over all\nforeground lenses is simply replaced by ~\u03b3close , the shear induced by the lens that is closest to\nthe source in projection on the sky.\nShown in Figure 1 is a zoomed-in image of one of the simulations. The image is centered\non the HDF-N, and the locations of chips 2, 3, and 4 on WFPC-2 are shown by the black\nlines. Here a fiducial lens halo model with \u03c3v\u2217 = 150 km sec\u22121 and s = 100h\u22121 kpc has\nbeen adopted, and the source galaxies have been distributed in redshift space according to\nequation (6) above. A flat \u039b-dominated cosmology with H0 = 70 km sec\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9m0 = 0.3\nand \u03a9\u039b0 = 0.7 has been also been adopted. The left panel of Figure 1 shows the magnitude\nof the net shear, and for clarity the orientation of the net shear is not shown. Red peaks\nin the shear field (i.e., locations of the largest net shear) correspond to the locations of\nthe most important weak galaxy lenses in the field. The right panel of Figure 1 shows the\nsurface mass density of the lens galaxies. Note that some very luminous (and, therefore very\nmassive) galaxies do not show up in the shear field due to the fact that their redshifts place\nthem well beyond the median redshift of the sources. A good example of this is the galaxy\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nlocated at (\u221223.20, +56.70) in Figure 1. This galaxy has coordinates on the sky of RA =\n12h 36m 52.72s , DEC = +62\u25e6 13\u2032 54.70\u2032\u2032 (J2000). Its rest-frame blue luminosity is 2.95L\u2217B\nand, hence, its halo mass is 6.9 \u00d7 1012 M\u2299 (for the fiducial model). The center of this galaxy\nhas a high surface mass density (indicated by red in the right panel of Figure 1). However,\nsince the redshift of this galaxy is z = 1.355, it cannot act as a lens for the majority of the\nsources. Therefore, it does not contribute substantially to the net shear field. By contrast,\nthe two smaller galaxies that are immediately to the east and west of this intrinsically very\nbright and massive galaxy do show up quite prominently in the shear field. These galaxies\nhave coordinates on the sky of RA = 12h 36m 54.07s , DEC = +62\u25e6 13\u2032 54.20\u2032\u2032 and RA =\n12h 36m 51.77s , DEC = +62\u25e6 13\u2032 53.70\u2032\u2032 , corresponding to locations of (\u221232.65, +56.20) and\n(\u221216.56, +55.70) in Figure 1. These two galaxies have luminosities of Least = 0.70L\u2217B and\nLwest = 0.87L\u2217B , and redshifts of zeast = 0.851 and zwest = 0.557. Both of these galaxies are\nassigned very similar halo masses in the simulation (since their luminosities are very similar),\nand both are clearly visible in the shear field as red peaks. However, the easternmost of these\ntwo galaxies corresponds to a smaller peak in the shear field than the westernmost because\nthe redshift of the easternmost galaxy is only slightly less than the median redshift of the\nsources, while the redshift of the westernmost galaxy is of order half the median redshift\nof the sources. For a color image of the HDF-N in which the redshifts of the galaxies are\nindicated, the reader is encouraged to see Figure 2 of Cohen et al. (2000).\n\n3.\n\nFrequency of Multiple Deflections\n\nThe probability that a given source galaxy will have been weakly-lensed by one or more\nforeground galaxies is, of course, a strong function of the actual value of the shear, \u03b3, induced\nby a given weak lensing deflection. That is, it is much more likely for a distant galaxy to\nbe lensed by a foreground galaxy which produces an insignificant weak shear of \u03b3 \u223c 10\u22126\nthan, say, a relatively large weak shear of \u03b3 \u223c 0.01. Therefore, in order to discuss the total\nnumber of weak deflections that a given source galaxy is likely to encounter, a decision has\nto be made as to what value of \u03b3 qualifies as a \"significant\" value of the shear. A typical\nvalue of the shear induced by a single weak galaxy lens is \u03b3 \u223c 0.005 (see, e.g., BBS) and this\nvalue of \u03b3 will be used as a baseline for computing the number of weak lensing deflections\nthat source galaxies have undergone in the Monte Carlo simulations.\nTo begin this section, the Monte Carlo simulations will be restricted to the fiducial halo\nlens model from the previous section in which \u03c3v\u2217 = 150 km sec\u22121 and s\u2217 = 100h\u22121 kpc, and\nsources will be placed in single planes in redshift (i.e., all sources will be assigned identical\nredshifts). Figures 2, 3, and 4, then, show the probability, P (NL ), that a given source with\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n\nFig. 1.- A localized region of a simulation, centered on the HDF-N. The figure has been\noriented according to the standard convention (i.e., \"North\" is up, and \"East\" is to the left).\nThe characteristic chevron of WFPC-2 is indicated by the black lines. Note that in the\nfull simulations, the lens galaxies are contained within an area that is \u223c 16.5 times larger\nthan the HDF-N. A fiducial halo model with \u03c3v\u2217 = 150 km sec\u22121 and s\u2217 = 100h\u22121 kpc, and\ncosmological parameters H0 = 70 km sec\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9m0 , and \u03a9\u039b0 have been adopted. The\nmedian redshift of the lenses is zl = 0.55 and the median redshift of the sources is zs = 0.96.\nLeft: Logarithm of the net shear produced by the lens galaxies. Peaks in the shear field\ncorrespond to the most important weak galaxy lenses in the localized region of the HDF-N.\nRight: Logarithm of the surface mass density of the lens galaxies. Here the units of surface\nmass density are solar masses per square arcsecond. Due to their redshifts being much greater\nthan the median redshift of the sources, some galaxies that contribute significantly to the\nsurface mass density do not contribute significantly to the shear field. Conversely, some\ngalaxies that contribute relatively little to the surface mass density contribute a substantial\namount to the shear field because their redshifts are considerably smaller than the median\nredshift of the sources.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nredshift zs will be lensed by NL foreground galaxies, where each individual deflection gives\nrise to a shear of \u03b3 > 0.0025, \u03b3 > 0.005, and \u03b3 > 0.01, respectively (i.e., the minimum shear\nin these figures corresponds to half the baseline value, the baseline value, and twice the\nbaseline value, respectively). Here P (ND = 2) is the probability that a given source will be\nlensed by two individual foreground galaxies, each of which lensed the source galaxy at a level\nthat is comparable to or greater than the minimum shear value. Since the minimum values\nadopted in Figures 2, 3, and 4 are \"substantial\" values of the galaxy-galaxy lensing shear,\nthe results shown in these figures are conservative estimates of the frequency of multiple\ndeflections. The line types in Figures 2, 3, and 4 correspond to different values of the\ncosmological parameters. In all cases H0 = 70 km sec\u22121 Mpc\u22121 is adopted. Solid lines show\nresults for a flat \u039b-dominated universe with \u03a9m0 = 0.3 and \u03a9\u039b0 = 0.7, dashed lines show\nresults for an open universe with \u03a9m0 = 0.3 and \u03a9\u039b0 = 0.0, and dotted lines show results for\nan Einstein-de Sitter universe.\nFigures 2, 3, and 4 demonstrate two fully expected results. First, the frequency of multiple deflections in galaxy-galaxy lensing is a function of the source redshift: the higher the\nredshift, the more likely multiple deflections are to occur. Second, the frequency of multiple\ndeflections in galaxy-galaxy lensing depends upon the minimum shear value that is adopted:\nthe lower the value of the minimum shear, the more likely that multiple deflections of at\nleast the minimum value will occur. Figure 2 shows that multiple deflections in which each\nindividual deflection results in a shear of \u03b3 > 0.0025 are highly probable. The probability\nranges from 67% for sources with zs = 0.75 to 100% for sources with zs = 2.0. Similarly,\nFigure 3 shows that multiple deflections in which each individual deflection results in a shear\nof \u03b3 > 0.005 are highly probable. In this case, the probability ranges from 23% for sources\nwith zs = 0.75 to 92% for sources with zs = 2.0. Multiple deflections in which each individual\ndeflection results in a shear of \u03b3 > 0.01 are relatively rare for sources with zs \u2264 1.0, but the\nprobability of such very large multiple deflections increases to 45% for sources with zs = 2.0\n(Figure 4).\nIn addition to the frequency of multiple deflections, Figures 2, 3, and 4 make an important point about the role of the cosmological parameters in galaxy-galaxy lensing. By\nand large, the number and magnitude of individual weak lensing deflections is unaffected\nby the choice of the cosmological parameters. That is, galaxy-galaxy lensing primarily provides information about the potentials of the lens galaxies, not the cosmology per se (see\nalso BBS). Therefore, for the remainder of the manuscript a flat \u039b-dominated universe with\nH0 = 70 km sec\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9m0 = 0.3, and \u03a9\u039b0 = 0.7 will be adopted.\nWhile galaxy-galaxy lensing is largely insensitive to the values of the cosmological parameters, it is quite sensitive to masses of the halos of the lens galaxies.

For NL > 1,\nmultiple deflections with \u03b3 > 0.0025 have been experienced by the source. Source redshifts\nrange from zs = 0.75 (top left) to zs = 2.0 (bottom right). The median lens redshift is\nzl = 0.55. A fiducial halo model with \u03c3v\u2217 = 150 km sec\u22121 and s\u2217 = 100h\u22121 kpc has been\nadopted. Line types correspond to different values of the cosmological parameters. Solid\nlines: flat \u039b-dominated universe. Dashed lines: open universe. Dotted lines: Einstein-de\nSitter universe.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Same as Figure 2, except here the frequency of deflections with \u03b3 > 0.005 is\nshown. For NL > 1, multiple deflections have been experienced by the source.\n\nFig. 4.- Same as Figure 2, except here the frequency of deflections with \u03b3 > 0.01 is shown.\nFor NL > 1, multiple deflections have been experienced by the source.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\ngalaxy-galaxy lensing on the physical radii of the halos of the lens galaxies is rather weak\n(see, e.g., BBS; Hoekstra et al. 2004; Kleinheinrich et al. 2006); however, the dependence\nof galaxy-galaxy lensing on the velocity dispersions of the halos of the lens galaxies is quite\nstrong. The effect of varying the characteristic lens parameters on the frequency of multiple weak deflections is shown in Figures 5, 6, and 7. In contrast with Figures 2, 3, and\n4, here the source galaxies have been distributed broadly in redshift space (as in Figure\n1), with a median source redshift of zs \u223c 0.96. The characteristic halo parameters for L\u2217B\ngalaxies are varied as follows: \u03c3v\u2217 = 135 km sec\u22121 , \u03c3v\u2217 = 150 km sec\u22121 , \u03c3v\u2217 = 165 km sec\u22121 ;\ns\u2217 = 50h\u22121 kpc, s\u2217 = 100h\u22121 kpc, s\u2217 = 200h\u22121 kpc. As in Figures 2, 3, and 4, the shear\nproduced by each individual deflection is restricted to \u03b3 > 0.0025 (Figure 5), \u03b3 > 0.005\n(Figure 6), and \u03b3 > 0.01 (Figure 7).\nFor the adopted source redshift distribution, then, the probability of multiple weak\ndeflections increases as the characteristic mass of the halos of L\u2217B lens galaxies increases.\nThat is, the larger is the mass of the lens, the wider is its aperture of influence on the sky.\nFor the adopted source redshift distribution, there is a high probability of multiple deflections\nin which each individual deflection results in a shear of \u03b3 > 0.0025. The probability ranges\nfrom 54% for the lowest characteristic halo mass (Figure 5, top left) to 82% for the highest\ncharacteristic halo mass (Figure 5, bottom right). Similarly, there is a high probability of\nmultiple deflections in which each individual deflection results in a shear of \u03b3 > 0.005. The\nprobability ranges from 26% for the lowest characteristic halo mass (Figure 6, top left) to 59%\nfor the highest characteristic halo mass (Figure 6, bottom right). From Figure 7, instances\nof multiple deflections in which each individual deflection results in a very substantial shear\nof \u03b3 > 0.01 are relatively rare for low values of \u03c3v\u2217 and s\u2217 . However, for large values of \u03c3v\u2217\nand s\u2217 , the probability can exceed 20%. Note that, at fixed impact parameter, the deflection\nangle, \u03b1, caused by L\u2217B lenses scales as essentially s\u2217 (\u03c3v\u2217 )2 . So, for a lens with a given velocity\ndispersion, the deflection angle scales approximately linearly with s\u2217 . This naturally leads to\nlarger induced shear for larger values of s\u2217 , and a correspondingly larger number of individual\ndeflections that exceed the minimum shear thresholds used in Figures 5-7.\n\n4.\n\nMultiple Deflections vs. Single Deflections\n\nThe previous section explored the frequency with which source galaxies undergo multiple\nweak deflections in a deep galaxy-galaxy lensing data set. This section will explore how the\nnet shear, \u03b3net , obtained from a full, multiple-deflection calculation compares to the shear\nobtained solely from the closest lens in projection on the sky (\u03b3close ), as well as how the net\nshear compares to the shear resulting from the largest individual deflection in the multiple-\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n\nFig. 5.- Probability, P (NL ), that a source galaxy has been lensed by NL foreground\ngalaxies, where each individual lens induces a shear \u03b3 > 0.0025. For NL > 1, multiple\ndeflections with \u03b3 > 0.0025 have been experienced by the source. Here the sources have\nbeen distributed broadly in redshift space with a median redshift zs = 0.96, and a flat \u039bdominated universe with H0 = 70 km sec\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9m0 = 0.3 and \u03a9\u039b0 = 0.7 has been\nadopted. Lens galaxies have a median redshift zl = 0.55. Different panels correspond to\ndifferent characteristic parameters (\u03c3v\u2217 , s\u2217 ) adopted for the halos of L\u2217B lens galaxies.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n\nFig. 6.- Same as Figure 5, except here the frequency of deflections with \u03b3 > 0.005 is\nshown.

In particular, the following questions will be addressed:\n\u2022 Is the closest weak lens (in projection on the sky) necessarily the most important weak\nlens?\n\u2022 Is the net shear for a given source galaxy in the multiple-deflection calculation larger\nor smaller than the shear induced by the closest lens?\n\u2022 Is the net shear for a given source galaxy in the multiple-deflection calculation larger\nor smaller than the shear resulting from the largest individual weak deflection?\n\u2022 What effect does the inclusion of multiple deflections have on the mean tangential\nshear measured about the lens centers?\nThroughout this section, source galaxies in the Monte Carlo simulations will be taken\nto have the broad redshift distribution used in Figure 1 (e.g., equation 6 above) and a flat\n\u039b-dominated universe will be used.\nThe first question of this section is addressed in Figure 8. Here the probability distribution for the distance between the strongest individual weak lens, \u03b8max , and the closest\nweak lens, \u03b8min , is shown. The different panels correspond to different characteristic halo\nparameters that have been adopted for the halos of L\u2217B galaxies (and appropriately scaled\nfor all lenses according to equations 2 and 3 above). Figure 8 shows that, in general, the\nclosest lens in projection on the sky is not the strongest individual weak lens. That is, of\norder 50% of the time the closest lens is not the \"most important\" weak lens. Figure 8 also\nshows the importance of performing the multiple-deflection calculation using sources that\nare contained within an area that is smaller than the area covered by the lenses, since the\nangular separation between the closest lens to a given source and the most important lens\nfor that same source can reach scales of more than 2 arcminutes. In particular, \u223c 35% of\nthe strongest lenses have angular separations & 20 arcsec from the sources and \u223c 10% of\nthe strongest lenses have angular separations & 60 arcsec from the sources.\nFigures 9 and 10 address the second and third questions of this section. That is, how does\nthe net shear experienced by source galaxies in a full, multiple-deflection calculation compare\nto the shear due to only the closest lens (Figure 9) and to the shear due to the strongest\nindividual weak lens (Figure 10)? Figure 9 shows that the net shear due to all foreground\nlenses is generally larger than the shear induced by the closest lens on the sky. The ratio\nof the shears, \u03b3net /\u03b3close , is weakly-dependent upon the specifics of the lens halo parameters.\nThe probability that the net shear in the full multiple-deflection calculation exceeds the\nshear due to the single closest lens ranges from 78% (lens halos with small physical extents,\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\n\nFig. 8.- Probability distribution for the distance between the strongest individual weak\nlens for a given source, \u03b8max , and the closest individual weak lens for a given source, \u03b8close .\nThe distance is zero when the closest lens is, in fact, the strongest lens for a given source.\nThe probability that the strongest individual lens for a given source is not the closest lens is\ngiven in each panel, and is of order 50% in all cases. Different panels correspond to different\ncharacteristic halo parameters (\u03c3v\u2217 , s\u2217 ) adopted for L\u2217B lens galaxies.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\ns\u2217 = 50h\u22121 kpc) to 82% (lens halos with large physical extents, s\u2217 = 200h\u22121 kpc). Figure 10\nshows that the net shear due to all foreground lenses is also generally larger than the shear\ninduced by the strongest individual weak lens in the full, multiple-deflection calculation. As\nin Figure 9, the ratio of the shears, \u03b3net /\u03b3max , is weakly-dependent upon the specifics of\nthe lens halo parameters. The probability that the net shear in the full multiple-deflection\ncalculation exceeds the shear due to the single strongest weak lens ranges from 69% (lens\nhalos with small physical extents, s\u2217 = 50h\u22121 kpc) to 76% (lens halos with large physical\nextents, s\u2217 = 200\u22121 kpc). Figures 9 and 10, then, show that for any given distant source\ngalaxy, the net shear that its image experiences due to all foreground lenses exceeds the\nshear due solely to the closest lens, as well as the shear due solely to the strongest individual\nweak lens.\nIt may seem somewhat counter-intuitive that the net shear experienced by the images\nof distant source galaxies in the multiple-deflection calculations generally exceeds the shear\ndue to a naive single-deflection calculation. That is, at first glance one might expect that\nmultiple weak galaxy-galaxy lensing deflections should, on average, cancel each other. For\na given source this would, indeed, be the case if all the foreground lenses were located at\nprecisely the same angular separation from the source, had identical gravitational potentials,\nand had identical redshifts, zl . Such an idealized situation is, of course, not the case in the\nreal universe. That is, we cannot think in terms of a single lens plane for the galaxy-galaxy\nlensing problem, and to a certain extent the solution has to be understood numerically. This\nis due to the fact that there are a wide range of lens-source separations, the lenses have a wide\nrange of gravitational potentials, and the lenses are distributed broadly in redshift. These,\nin combination, result in increased shear in the multiple-deflection calculation for galaxygalaxy lensing, much as the non-uniformities in the mass distribution along the line of sight\ngive rise to a net \"cosmic shear\" (see, e.g., reviews by Bartelmann & Schneider 2001; van\nWaerbeke & Mellier 2003; Refregier 2003; Munshi et al. 2008). That is, like galaxy-galaxy\nlensing, cosmic shear is inherently a multiple-deflection problem in which the deflections do\nnot simply cancel. A detailed investigation of how the shear experienced by a given source\ngalaxy is affected as one successively adds in more and more weak galaxy lenses will be\npresented in Howell & Brainerd (2010).\nThe last question of this section, the effect of multiple deflections on the mean tangential\nshear about the lens centers, is addressed in Figure 11. In Figures 9 and 10, we have\ncomputed quantities (net shear, shear due to the closest weak lens, and shear due to the\nstrongest individual weak lens) that cannot, in practice, be measured in an observational\ndata set. That is, without precise knowledge of the intrinsic shape of a source galaxy, the\nangular diameter distances of the source and all possible foreground lens galaxies, as well as\nthe details of the gravitational potentials of all foreground lens galaxies, it is not possible to\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\n\nFig. 9.- Probability distribution for the ratio of the net shear experienced by the images\nof source galaxies, \u03b3net , to the shear induced solely by the closest lens on the sky, \u03b3close .\nDifferent panels correspond to different characteristic halo parameters (\u03c3v\u2217 , s\u2217 ) adopted for\nL\u2217B lens galaxies. The probability that \u03b3net exceeds \u03b3close is listed in each panel.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n\nFig. 10.- Same as Figure 9, except here the net shear, \u03b3net , is compared to the shear\ninduced by the strongest individual lenses in the multiple-deflection calculation, \u03b3max .\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\ndeduce \u03b3net , \u03b3close , and \u03b3max for any one source galaxy. Indeed, galaxy-galaxy lensing yields\nsuch a small value of \u03b3net that it can only be detected via an ensemble average over the\nimages of many source galaxies. Therefore, Figure 11 demonstrates the effect of multiple\ndeflections on the observable galaxy-galaxy lensing signal: the mean tangential shear about\nthe lens centers.\nShown in Figure 11 is the mean tangential shear, \u03b3T (\u03b8), measured as a function of lenssource angular separation. Since the sources are restricted to a circle of radius 2.5 arcmin,\nwhile the lenses are restricted to a circle of radius 4.0 arcmin, it is not possible to compute\n\u03b3T (\u03b8) around all of the lenses. Instead, \u03b3T (\u03b8) is computed using only those lenses that are\nwithin a distance r = (150 \u2212 \u03b8) arcsec of the center of the field. This allows the average\nto be computed in complete circular annuli, centered on each lens galaxy, and avoids edge\neffects. Solid squares in Figure 11 show \u03b3T (\u03b8) for the full multiple-deflection calculations in\nwhich each source has been lensed by all foreground lenses. Open circles in Figure 11 show\n\u03b3T (\u03b8) for single deflection calculations in which each source is lensed by only the closest lens\non the sky. Shown in Figure 12 is the ratio of the mean tangential shears that are plotted in\nFigure 11. That is, Figure 12 shows the ratio of the mean tangential shear obtained from the\nfull multiple-deflection calculations to that obtained from the single-deflection calculations.\nFrom Figures 11 and 12, then, it is clear that on very small scales, galaxy-galaxy lensing\nreduces to a single-deflection problem. That is, on scales \u03b8 \u223c 1 arcsec, there is relatively\nlittle difference between the mean tangential shear obtained from the full, multiple-deflection\ncalculations and the single deflection calculations. On scales of \u03b8 & 2 arcsec, however, the\nmultiple deflection calculations yield a higher value of the mean tangential shear. The\ndifference between \u03b3T (\u03b8) from the multiple deflection calculations and \u03b3T (\u03b8) from the single\ndeflection calculations depends somewhat on the characteristic parameters adopted for the\nhalos of L\u2217B galaxies. On scales \u03b8 \u223c 20 arcsec, the multiple deflection calculation for the\nlowest mass halos (top left panel of Figure 12) yields a mean tangential shear that is a factor\nof \u223c 1.4 larger than the mean tangential shear from the single deflection calculation. The\nmultiple deflection calculation for the highest mass halos (bottom right panel of Figure 12)\nyields a mean tangential shear that is a factor of \u223c 1.7 larger than the mean tangential shear\nfrom the single deflection calculation for \u03b8 \u223c 20 arcsec. It is also interesting to note that\n\u03b3T (\u03b8) becomes roughly constant on scales \u03b8 & 10 arcsec. This is due to the fact that the\nmean angular separation between the lens galaxies is 10.7 arcseconds, which corresponds to\na comoving distance of 48h\u22121 kpc at the median redshift of the lenses. That is, on angular\nscales comparable to and larger than the mean angular separation of the lenses, the halos\nof nearby lens galaxies are overlapping one another in projection on the sky. This is the\nprimary reason that galaxy-galaxy lensing is not terribly sensitive to the radii of the halos\nof the lens galaxies.\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\n\nFig. 11.- Mean tangential shear, \u03b3T (\u03b8), computed in circular annuli of radius \u03b8, centered on\nthe lens galaxies.

Different panels\ncorrespond to different characteristic parameters (\u03c3v\u2217 , s\u2217 ), adopted for the halos of L\u2217B lens\ngalaxies. Dotted line indicates a value of unity. On scales of \u03b8 & 2 arcsec the mean tangential\nshear from the full multiple deflection calculations, \u03b3T,net (\u03b8), exceeds the mean tangential\nshear from the single-deflection calculations, \u03b3T,close (\u03b8).\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\nIt should be kept in mind that here we have only modeled the masses of the halos of\nindividual galaxies. In particular, we have not included the fact that many of the larger,\nbrighter galaxies are probably contained within group environments that have a substantial\ndark matter component over and above the dark matter halos of the individual galaxies. The\ncircularly-averaged tangential shear (as we have computed here) is related to the surface mass\ndensity of a circular lens through\n\u03b3T \u03a3c = \u03a3(< \u03b8) \u2212 \u03a3(\u03b8) \u2261 \u2206\u03a3\n\n(10)\n\n(e.g., Miralda-Escud\u00e9 1991). In the case of completely isolated lens galaxies, \u2206\u03a3 above is\nthe surface mass density of the dark matter halo of the lens galaxy. In the case of lenses\nthat reside within groups and clusters, \u2206\u03a3 includes the mass due to the dark matter halos\nof the lens galaxies, as well as the mass of the larger dark matter halo that surrounds the\ngroup or cluster. In the case of bright, massive galaxies that reside in groups and clusters,\nthe tangential shear shown in Figure 11 does not properly correlate with all of the mass that\none would actually expect to contribute to the net shear in a observational data set. This is\nsimply because we have neglected the additional mass associated with the environments in\nwhich those galaxies tend to reside.\nObservations of galaxy-galaxy lensing have shown that the dependence of the tangential\nshear on projected distance from the lens is a function of the stellar mass and luminosity of\nthe lens. In particular, the tangential shear measured around lens galaxies with low stellar\nmasses and low luminosities is approximately constant at very large projected distances (e.g.,\nMandelbaum et al. 2006a, Figures 1 and 2), consistent with the results in Figure 11 above.\nHowever, the tangential shear measured around lens galaxies with high stellar masses and\nhigh luminosities declines monotonically at large projected distances (e.g., Mandelbaum et\nal. 2006a, Figures 1 and 2). This is due to the contribution of the overall mass within the\nrelatively higher density environments in which the most massive, most luminous galaxies\ntend to reside. That is, in practice observed galaxy-galaxy lensing includes the effects of all\nindividual galaxy lenses, as well as the effects of the mass within the local environment that\nsurrounds the lenses. Here we have simply considered the effects of the individual halos of\nbright galaxies, and have not included environmental (e.g., group/cluster) contributions to\nthe net shear.\nThe implications of Figures 11 and 12 are straightforward. If one wishes to use observations of \u03b3T (\u03b8) to constrain the fundamental parameters associated with the halos of the lens\ngalaxies (i.e., \u03c3v\u2217 and s\u2217 for the model adopted here), it is vital to use full, multiple-deflection\nMonte Carlo simulations for the parameter fitting. If simple, single-deflection calculations\nare used, the inferred halo masses will be systematically too large. That is, in order to\nreproduce an observed galaxy-galaxy lensing signal on angular scales greater than a few\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\narcseconds using a single-deflection calculation, one would need systematically larger halo\nmasses than are required in the full multiple-deflection calculation.\n\n5.\n\nGalaxy-Galaxy Lensing and Cosmic Shear\n\nThe galaxy-galaxy lensing contribution to cosmic shear is investigated in this section.\nCosmic shear is often equated to weak lensing by the large-scale structure of the universe,\nbut in practice cosmic shear is the result of photons from distant source galaxies being\ndeflected by all mass along the line of sight. The mass along the line of sight includes large\ngalaxy clusters, galaxy groups, and filaments, as well as objects with smaller masses such as\nindividual galaxies. In the case of the galaxy-galaxy lensing, we are considering the specific\ncontribution of the highly non-linear, large k contribution of the power spectrum of density\nfluctuations, P (k), to the cosmic shear signal.\nThe source galaxies in the Monte Carlo simulations are assumed to have orientations\nthat are intrinsically uncorrelated (i.e., each source is assigned an initially random position\nangle). Galaxy-galaxy lensing will, of course, slightly change both the ellipticity and the\norientation of each source. In the presence of a number of high-mass lens galaxies that cause\nmultiple weak deflections over large angular scales, the images of the source galaxies may\nacquire a net preferred orientation due to galaxy-galaxy lensing. This is the signature of\ncosmic shear, albeit in this case the shear is caused solely by the lens galaxies, not the entire\nlarge-scale structure of the universe.\nTo investigate the degree to which galaxy-galaxy lensing may contribute to the cosmic\nshear signal, the image correlation function\nC\u03c7\u03c7 (\u03b8) = \u03c7\n~ f,i * \u03c7\n~ \u2217f,j\n\n\u03b8\n\n(11)\n\nis computed. Here the mean is computed over all galaxy pairs i, j separated by an angle\n\u03b8\u00b1d\u03b8/2, \u03c7\n~ f,i is the final shape parameter of source galaxy i, and \u03c7\n~ \u2217f,j is the complex conjugate\nof the final shape parameter of galaxy j (see, e.g., Blandford et al. 1991). The correlation\nfunction measures the extent to which galaxy images \"point\" in the same direction on the\nsky. If C\u03c7\u03c7 (\u03b8) is positive, the images of the galaxies are aligned with each other. If C\u03c7\u03c7 (\u03b8)\nis zero, the images of the galaxies are randomly oriented. If C\u03c7\u03c7 (\u03b8) is negative, the images\nof the galaxies tend to be oriented perpendicular to each other (i.e., they are anti-aligned).\nShown in Figure 13 is the image correlation function for the source galaxies, where\nthe galaxies have again been broadly distributed in redshift space and a flat \u039b-dominated\nuniverse has been adopted. Solid squares show the results for the full, multiple-deflection\ncalculations and open circles show the results for the single-deflection calculations in which\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\nthe sources have been lensed by only the closest lenses. From Figure 13, then, it is clear\nthat for angular separations \u03b8 & 5 arcsec, the single-deflection calculations yield essentially\nno contribution of galaxy-galaxy lensing to the cosmic shear. That is, if multiple deflections\nwere not important in galaxy-galaxy lensing, one would expect that on scales greater than\n5 arcsec, galaxies alone would not contribute to cosmic shear. Hence, cosmic shear on\nscales greater than 5 arcsec would be expected to be largely independent of the gravitational\npotentials of the halos of field galaxies. However, the full, multiple-deflection calculations in\nFigure 13 show that galaxy-galaxy lensing can, indeed, induce substantial correlations in the\nsource images on scales greater than 5 arcsec. Furthermore, the degree of lensing-induced\nimage alignment is strongly affected by the characteristic parameters that are adopted for\nthe halos of L\u2217B lenses.\nIn addition to the image correlation function, the top hat shear variance\nZ \u221e\n2\ndk\n2\n\u03b3 = 2\nP\u03ba (k) [J1 (k\u03b8)]2\n\u03c0\u03b8 0 k\n\n(12)\n\nis common measure of cosmic shear. Here P\u03ba is the power spectrum of the projected mass\ndensity of the universe, J1 is a Bessel function of the first kind, and \u03b8 is the radius of the\ncircular aperture over which the mean is computed. In an observational data set, the function\nis computed as\nX\n1\n~\u03b3i * \u03b3~j \u2217 ,\n(13)\n\u03b32 =\nN(N \u2212 1) i6=j\nfor all galaxies within a circular aperture of radius \u03b8 on the sky. Solid squares in Figure\n14 show the shear top hat variance due to galaxy-galaxy lensing alone, obtained from full,\nmultiple-deflection calculations. Again, sources have been broadly distributed in redshift\nand a flat \u039b-dominated universe is adopted. Also shown for comparison (crosses connected\nby dotted line) are the measured values of h\u03b3 2 i obtained by Fu et al. (2008) for galaxies in\nthe CFHT Legacy Survey with a median redshift zm = 0.83. Although this is somewhat\nlower than the median redshift of the source galaxies in the Monte Carlo simulations, it is\nsufficiently similar that it is reasonable to compare the observational and theoretical results\ndirectly.\nFrom Figure 14, the small-scale contribution of galaxy-galaxy lensing to h\u03b3 2 i depends\nquite strongly on the parameters adopted for the halos of L\u2217B galaxies, and scales roughly\nwith the relative masses of the halos. For example, the lowest mass L\u2217B lenses (top left\npanel) have masses that are a factor of 2.5 smaller than those of the fiducial halo with\n\u03c3v\u2217 = 150 km sec\u22121 and s\u2217 = 100h\u22121 kpc (middle panel). Similarly, the highest mass L\u2217B\nlenses (bottom right panel) have masses that are a factor of 2.4 larger than those of the\nfiducial halo. At \u03b8 = 1 arcmin, h\u03b3 2 i for the lowest mass lenses is a factor of 3 smaller than\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\n\nFig. 13.- Image correlation function, C\u03c7\u03c7 (\u03b8), due to galaxy-galaxy lensing alone. Different\npanels correspond to different characteristic parameters (\u03c3v\u2217 , s\u2217 ) adopted for the halos of\nL\u2217B galaxies. Solid squares: results of full multiple-deflection calculations in which source\ngalaxies have been lensed by all foreground galaxies. Open circles: results of single-deflection\ncalculations in which source galaxies are lensed only by the closest lens.\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\nit is for the fiducial halo, and h\u03b3 2 i for the highest mass lenses is a factor of 3.5 larger than\nit is for the fiducial halo.\nComparing the squares in Figure 14 (simulation results) to the crosses (observational\nresults), it is clear that, depending upon how deep the potential wells of L\u2217B galaxies are,\ngalaxy-galaxy lensing alone may contribute a substantial amount to cosmic shear. In the case\nof the lowest mass L\u2217B halos, galaxy-galaxy lensing alone would be expected to contribute\nonly \u223c 5.5% of the value of h\u03b3 2 i measured by Fu et al. (2008) for an aperture of radius\n\u03b8 = 1 arcmin. In the case of the fiducial L\u2217B halos, the contribution of galaxy-galaxy lensing\nalone increases to \u223c 16% for \u03b8 = 1 arcmin, while for the highest mass L\u2217B halos \u223c 58% of\nthe signal seen by Fu et al. (2008) at \u03b8 = 1 arcmin would be due to galaxy-galaxy lensing\nalone. If one were to extrapolate the Fu et al. (2008) results to scales \u03b8 < 1 arcmin, the\nresults shown in the bottom right panel of Figure 14 suggest that the halos of L\u2217B galaxies\nare probably not as large adopted in this particular panel. That is, a simple extrapolation\nof the Fu et al. (2008) result to \u03b8 < 1 arcmin leads to an expectation of much less observed\ncosmic shear than is predicted by galaxy-galaxy lensing by our highest mass lenses.\nBecause of the relatively small area of the sky that is covered by the sources in the Monte\nCarlo simulations, it is not possible to compute h\u03b3 2 i on large angular scales. However, the rms\n1/2\nvalue, h\u03b3 2 i , decreases linearly with \u03b8 and it is, therefore, straightforward to extrapolate the\nresults from Figure 14 to an angular scale at which the contribution of galaxy-galaxy lensing\nto cosmic shear vanishes. From this extrapolation, then, the contribution of galaxy-galaxy\nlensing to cosmic shear vanishes at \u03b8 = 5.0 arcmin for the lowest mass halos, \u03b8 = 5.2 arcmin\nfor the fiducial model, and \u03b8 = 5.4 arcmin for the highest mass halos. Therefore, although\nthe contribution of galaxy-galaxy lensing to cosmic shear on small angular scales is very\nsensitive to the details of the gravitational potentials of galaxies, cosmic shear on scales\n\u03b8 & 5 arcmin should not be affected by galaxy-galaxy lensing to any significant degree.\n\n6.\n\nCosmic Variance\n\nThe shear field in the Monte Carlo simulations comes from a set of lenses that are\ncontained within an area of 50 sq. arcmin. on the sky and, therefore, one might be concerned\nthat the results shown above could be compromised by cosmic variance. Here some of the\nresults above are recomputed using subdivisions of the data in order to explore potential\nsmall field effects. To do this, we use the fiducial model in which the halos of L\u2217B galaxies\nhave velocity dispersions of \u03c3v\u2217 = 150 km sec\u22121 and characteristic radii of s\u2217 = 100h\u22121 kpc, we\ntake the sources to be broadly distributed in redshift as above, and we use a flat \u039b-dominated\ncosmology.\n\n\f\u2013 29 \u2013\n\nFig. 14.- Solid squares: top hat shear variance, h\u03b3 2 i, due to galaxy-galaxy lensing alone,\nobtained from the full multiple-deflection calculations. Different panels correspond to different characteristic parameters (\u03c3v\u2217 , s\u2217 ) adopted for the halos of L\u2217B galaxies. Shown for\ncomparison (crosses connected by dotted line) are the results from Fu et al. (2008) for the\ntop hat shear variance obtained from the CFHT Legacy Survey using sources with median\nredshift zs = 0.83.\n\n\f\u2013 30 \u2013\nShown in Figure 15 is a comparison of the frequency of multiple deflections that give\nrise to individual shear values of \u03b3 > 0.005 (top panels), the mean tangential shear about\nthe lens centers, \u03b3T (\u03b8) (middle panels), and the image correlation function, C\u03c7\u03c7 (\u03b8) (bottom\npanels) using different subdivisions of the data. The left hand panels show a comparison of\nresults obtained from data in the northern half of the field and results obtained from data in\nthe southern half of the filed. The right hand panels show results obtained from data in the\neastern half of the field and results obtained from data in the western half of the field. While\nthere are some differences that result when the size of the field is reduced by a factor of two,\nthe differences are small and suggest that the results obtained from the full field should not\nsuffer dramatically from effects of cosmic variance.\n\n7.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe frequency and effects of multiple weak lensing deflections in galaxy-galaxy lensing\nhave been investigated using Monte Carlo simulations. The lenses in the simulations are\nmodeled using observed galaxies with magnitudes R \u2264 23, contained within a circle of\nradius of 4 arcminutes, centered on the HDF-N. The lenses have known redshifts and known\nrest-frame B-band luminosities. By adopting a simple halo mass model it is possible to\ndetermine the relative strengths of each of the lenses using scaling relations.\nThe Monte Carlo simulations reveal a number of expected results: (i) the frequency\nof multiple deflections depends upon the minimum value of the shear (i.e., the lower is the\nminimum value, the more likely it is that multiple deflections will be experienced by a given\nsource), (ii) the frequency of multiple deflections depends upon the source redshift (i.e., the\nhigher is the source redshift, the more likely it is that will experience multiple deflections)\nand (iii) the higher are the masses of the lenses, the more likely it is that multiple deflections\nwill occur. For a deep galaxy-galaxy lensing data set in which the sources have a median\nredshift zs \u223c 1 and the lenses have a median redshift zl \u223c 0.6, the probability that a given\nsource galaxy will have experienced more than one weak lens that induces a \"typical\" shear\nof \u03b3 = 0.005 ranges from 26% to 59%, depending upon the masses adopted for the lenses.\nThe Monte Carlo simulations also reveal a number of results that may seem counterintuitive at first glance: (i) of order 50% of the time, the closest lens in projection on the sky is\nnot the most important weak lens for a given source, (ii) for a given source, the net shear due\nto all foreground lenses generally exceeds the shear due to the strongest individual weak lens,\nand (iii) multiple deflections give rise to a larger tangential shear around the lens galaxies\nthan a simple, single-deflection calculation in which the closest lens is assumed to be the\nonly lens. This emphasizes the importance of using full, multiple-deflection calculations when\n\n\f\u2013 31 \u2013\n\nFig. 15.- Comparison of the frequency of multiple weak deflections (top), the mean tangential shear (middle), and the image correlation function (bottom) for different subdivisions\nof the field. Left: comparison of results from the northern half of the field to results from\nthe southern half of the field. Right: comparison of results from the eastern half of the\nfield to results from the western half of the field. Here the sources have been broadly distributed in redshift with zmed = 0.96. The fiducial halo model with \u03c3v\u2217 = 150 km sec\u22121 and\ns\u2217 = 100h\u22121 kpc, and a flat \u039b-dominated cosmology have also been adopted.\n\n\f\u2013 32 \u2013\nusing observations of galaxy-galaxy lensing to constrain the parameters of the dark matter\nhalos of the lens galaxies. If multiple deflections are not incorporated into the calculation,\nthis will result in halo masses that are systematically too large.\nLastly, the Monte Carlo simulations reveal that galaxy-galaxy lensing alone can give\nrise to a cosmic shear signal on small angular scales. This is unsurprising because cosmic\nshear occurs when photons from distant galaxies are deflected by all mass along the line of\nsight. In the case of galaxy-galaxy lensing, it is the very large k end of the power spectrum of\ndensity fluctuations that contributes to the cosmic shear by inducing correlated image shapes\nfor the distant galaxies. On scales \u03b8 \u223c 1 arcmin, the degree to which galaxy-galaxy lensing\ncontributes to cosmic shear is quite sensitive to the masses of the lens galaxies. Changing\nthe mass of the halo of a fiducial L\u2217B galaxy by a factor of \u223c 2.5 changes the contribution\nto the top hat shear variance, h\u03b3 2 i, by a factor of \u223c 3. Comparing the theoretical values\nof h\u03b3 2 i at \u03b8 = 1 arcmin to the value observed by Fu et al. (2008) for sources with a similar\nredshift distribution, galaxy-galaxy lensing alone could account for as little as \u223c 5% or as\nmuch as \u223c 58% of the observed value, depending upon the halo mass for L\u2217B galaxies.\nWhile the small-scale contribution of galaxy-galaxy lensing to cosmic shear is quite\nsensitive to the masses of the lenses, the scale at which galaxy-galaxy lensing becomes unimportant to cosmic shear is relatively independent of the lens masses. If the results for the\ngalaxy-galaxy lensing contribution to cosmic shear are extrapolated to large scales, the contribution of galaxy-galaxy lensing to cosmic shear should vanish for scales \u03b8 & 5 arcmin,\nlargely independent of the lens masses.\n\nAcknowledgments\nI am pleased to thank of Judy Cohen and her collaborators, especially Mike Pahre and\nDavid Hogg, for all of their work on the Caltech Faint Galaxy Redshift Survey.
