Introduction and outline.\nIntroduction.\nFrom the work of Lian, Liu, and Yau on \"Mirror Principle\", in the explicit computation of the Euler data Q = { Q0 , Q1 , * * * } for an equivariant concavex bundle E over a\ntoric manifold, there are two places the structure of the bundle comes into play: (1) the\nmultiplicative characteric class Q0 of V one starts with, and (2) the splitting type of E.\nEquivariant bundles over a toric manifold has been classified by Kaneyama, using data\nrelated to the linearization of the toric action on the base toric manifold. The purpose of\nthese notes is to relate the splitting type of E to these classification data of Kaneyama.\nIn Sec. 1, we provide some general backgrounds and notations for this article. Some\nbasics of equivariant vector bundles over toric manifolds are provides in Sec. 2. In Sec. 3,\nwe discuss how the splitting type of an equivariant vector bundle over a toric manifold, if\nexists, can be obtained from the bundle data. In Sec. 4, we give two classes of examples.\nIn Example 4.1, we determine which non-decomposable equivariant rank 2 bundles over\nCP2 admit a splitting type and work out their splitting type. In Example 4.2, we discuss\nthe splitting type of tangent/cotangent bundles of toric manifolds. We start with the\nsplitting type for the (co)tangent bundle of CPn and then turn to the case of toric surfaces.\nThe isomorphism classes of the latter are coded in a weighted circular graph. From\nthese weights, one can decide whose (co)tangent bundle admits a splitting type. Since\nall toric surfaces arise from consecutive equivariant blowups of either CP2 or one of the\nthe Hirzebruch surfaces Fa and how the weights on the weighted circular graph behavior\nunder equivariant blowup is known, the task of deciding which (co)tangent bundle admits\na splitting type and determining them for those that admit one can be done with the\naid of computer. For the interest of string theory and mirror symmetry, from the toric\nsurfaces arising from equivaraint blowups of CP2 up to 9 points, we sort out those whose\n(co)tangent bundle admits a splitting type. The splitting type for their tangent bundle is\nalso computed and listed. A package in Mathematica that carries out this computation is\nattached for reference.\nOverall, this is part of the much bigger ambition of toric mirror symmetry computation\nvia Euler data, as discussed in [L-L-Y1, L-L-Y2, L-L-Y3]. We leave the application of the\ncurrent article to this goal for another work.\nOutline.\n1. Essential backgrounds and notations.\n2. Equivariant vector bundles over a toric manifold and their classifications.\n3. The splitting type of a toric equivariant bundle.\n4. The splitting type of some examples.\n5. Remarks and issues for further study.\nAppendix. The computer code.\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nEssential backgrounds and notations for physicists.\n\nIn this section, we collect some basic facts and notations that will be needed in the discussion. The part that is related to equivariant vector bundles over toric manifolds is singled\nout in Sec. 2. Readers are referred to the listed literatures for more details.\n\u2022 Toric geometry. ([A-G-M], [C-K], [Da], [Ew], [Fu], [Gre], [G-K-Z], [Ke], and [Od1,Od2].)\nPhysicists are referred particularly to [A-G-M] or [Gre] for a nice expository of toric geometry. Let us fix the terminology and notations here and refer the details to [Fu].\nNotation :\nN\u223c\n= Zn : a lattice;\nM = Hom (N, Z) : the dual lattice of N ;\nTN = Hom (M, C\u2217 ) : the (complex) n-torus;\n\u03a3 : a fan in NR ;\nX\u03a3 : the toric variety associeted to \u03a3;\n\u03a3(i) : the i-skeleton of \u03a3;\nU\u03c3 : the local affine chart of X\u03a3 associated to \u03c3 in \u03a3;\nx\u03c3 \u2208 U\u03c3 : the distinguished points associated to \u03c3;\nO\u03c3 : the TN -orbit of x\u03c3 under the TN -action on X\u03a3 ;\nV (\u03c3) : the orbit closure of O\u03c3 ;\nM (\u03c3) = \u03c3 \u22a5 \u2229 M .\nRecall that points v in the interior of \u03c3 \u2229 N represent one-parameter subgroups \u03bbv\nin TN such that limz\u21920 \u03bbv (z) = x\u03c4 . Recall also that the normal cones associated to a\npolyhedron \u2206 with vertices in M form a fan in NR , called the normal fan of \u2206. This\ndetermines a projective toric variety.\n\u2022 Toric surface. ([Od2].) Any complete nonsingular toric surface is obtained from\nconsecutive equivariant blowups of either CP2 or one of the Hurzebruch surfaces Fa at TN\nfixed points. Indeed, one has a complete classification of them as follows:\nFact 1.1 [toric surface]. ([Od2].) The set of isomorphism classes of complete nonsingular toric surfaces X\u03a3 is in one-to-one corresponce with the set of equivalent classes of\nweighted circular graphs w = (w1 , * * * , ws ) (under rotation and reflection) of the following\nform: (Figure 1-1.)\n(1) The circular graph having 3 vertices with weights 1, 1, 1.\n(2) The circular graph having 4 vertices with weights in circular order 0, a, 0, \u2212a.\n2\n\n\f(3) The weighted circular graphs with s \u2265 5 vertices that is obtained from one with\n(s \u2212 1) vertices by adding a vertex of weight 1 and reducing the weight of each\nof its two adjacent vertices by 1.\na\n\n1\n\nw1 1\n\nw1\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\nw2\n\n1\n(1)\n\na\n(2)\n\nw2 1\n\n(3)\n\nFigure 1-1. The weighted circular graphs that labels the isomorphism classes of complete nonsingular toric surfaces.\nLet \u03a3(1) = (v1 , * * * , vs ) in, say, counterclockwise order in NR , then for each i, there\nexists a unique integer ai such that vi\u22121 + vi+1 + ai vi = 0 (here, s + 1 \u2261 1). The\ncorrespondence is then given by X\u03a3 7\u2192 (a1 , * * * , as ).\n\u2022 Line bundles with positive/negative c1 . ([C-K], [Hi], and [Re].) Recall that the\nK\u00e4hler cone in H 2 (X\u03a3 , R) consists of all the K\u00e4hler classes of X\u03a3 and the Mori cone of\nX\u03a3 consists of all the classes in H2 (X\u03a3 , R) representable by effective 2-cycles. From [Re],\nthe Mori cone of X\u03a3 is generated by V (\u03c4 ), \u03c4 \u2208 \u03a3(n \u2212 1). We call a class \u03c9 \u2208 H 2 (X\u03a3 , R)\npositive (resp. negative), in notation \u03c9 > 0 (resp. \u03c9 < 0), if \u03c9 (resp. \u2212\u03c9) lies in the K\u00e4hler\ncone of X\u03a3 . The fact that the K\u00e4hler cone and the Mori cone of a complete toric manifold\nare dual to each other gives us a criterion for a line bundle over X\u03a3 to have positive c1 :\nFact 1.2 [positive/negative line bundle]. Given an n-dimensional toric manifold X\u03a3 .\nLet L \u2208 Pic (X\u03a3 ) be a line bundle over X\u03a3 and D be the associated divisor class as an\nelement in H2n\u22122 (X\u03a3 , Z). Then c1 (L) > 0 (resp. < 0) if and only if D * V (\u03c4 ) > 0 (resp.\n< 0) for all \u03c4 \u2208 \u03a3(n \u2212 1).\n\u2022 The augmented intersection matrix. ([Fu].) Given an n-dimensional complete\nnonsingular fan \u03a3. Let \u03a3(1) = { v1 , * * * , vJ } and \u03a3(n \u2212 1) = { \u03c41 , * * * , \u03c4I }. Let A1 and\nAn\u22121 be respectively the first and (n \u2212 1)-th Chow group of X\u03a3 . Then A1 is generated\nby V (\u03c4i ), i = 1, * * * , I, and An\u22121 is generated by D(vj ), j = 1, * * * , J. There is a\nnondegenerate pairing A1 \u00d7 An\u22121 \u2192 Z by taking the intersection number. Let Q be\nthe I \u00d7 J matrix whose (i, j)-entry is the intersection number V (\u03c4i ) * D(vj ). Since the\ngenerators for A1 and An\u22121 used here may not be linearly independent, we shall call Q\nthe augmented intersection matrix (with respect to the generators). Explicitly, Q can be\ndetermined as follows.\nLet \u03c4i = [vj1 , * * * , vjn\u22121 ] \u2208 \u03a3(n \u2212 1). Then \u03c4i is the intersection of two n-cones\n\u03c31 = [vj1 , * * * , vjn\u22121 , vjn ]\n\nand \u03c32 = [vj1 , * * * , vjn\u22121 , vjn\u2032 ]\n3\n\n\fin \u03a3. These vertices in \u03c31 \u222a \u03c32 satisfy a linear equation of the form\nvjn + vjn\u2032 + a1 vj1 + * * * + an\u22121 vjn\u22121 = 0 ,\nfor some unique integers a1 , * * * , an determined by \u03c31 \u222a \u03c32 . In terms of this, the i-th row\nof Q is simply the coefficient (row) vector of the above equation. I.e. V (\u03c4i ) * D(vjk ) = ak\nfor k = 1, * * * , n \u2212 1; V (\u03c4i ) * D(vjn ) = V (\u03c4i ) * D(vjn\u2032 ) = 1; and V (\u03c4i ) * D(vj ) = 0 for all\nother j.\n\u2022 Cox homogeneous coordinate ring of a toric manifold. ([Co] and [C-K], also [Au]\nand [Do].) Let \u03a3 be a fan in Rn with \u03a3(1) generated by {v1 , * * * , va } and An\u22121 (X\u03a3 ) be the\nChow group of X\u03a3 .

Their details can be found\nin Sec. 1-3 in [Co].\n\n2\n\nBasics of equivariant vector bundles over toric manifolds.\n\nEquivariant vector bundles over a toric manifold have been classified by Kaneyama and\nKlyachko independently, using differently sets of data ([Ka1] and [Kl]). In this article, we\nuse Kaneyama's data as the starting point to compute splitting types. Some necessary facts\nfrom [Ka1] and [Kl] are summarized below with possibly slight modification/rephrasing\nto make the geometric picture more transparent.\nEquivariant vector bundles over a toric manifold.\nA vector bundle E over a toric manifold X\u03a3 is equivariant if g \u2217 E = E for all g \u2208 TN .\nAn equivariant bundle is linearizable if the action on the base can be lifted to a fiberwise\nlinear action on the total space of the bundle.\nFact 2.1 [linearizability]. Every equivaraint vector bundle E over a toric manifold X\u03a3\nis linearizable.\n4\n\n\fIn general, a bundle can be described by its local trivializations and the pasting maps.\nFor an equivariant vector bundle E over a toric manifold X\u03a3 , these data can be integrated\nwith the linearization of the toric action.\n(1) Local trivializations :\nbundle splits:\n\nOver each invariant affine chart U\u03c3 for \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3, the\nE|U\u03c3 = \u2295\u03c7 U\u03c3 \u00d7 E\u03c3\u03c7 ,\n\nwhere E\u03c3\u03c7 is the representation of TN associated to the weight \u03c7 \u2208 M .\n(2) The pasting maps :\nOver each orbit O\u03c4 \u0592\u2192 U\u03c31 \u2229 U\u03c32 , the pasting map\n\u03c6\u03c32 \u03c31 : U\u03c31 \u2229 U\u03c32 \u2192 GL (r, C) is determined by its restriction at a point, say,\nx\u03c4 , in O\u03c4 , due to the equivariant requirement. The pasting maps over different\norbits in U\u03c31 \u2229 U\u03c32 are related to each other by the holomorphicity requirement\nthat \u03c6\u03c32 \u03c31 : U\u03c31 \u2229U\u03c32 \u2192 GL (r, C) must be holomorphic for every pair of \u03c31 , \u03c32\nin \u03a3. This implies that indeed \u03c6\u03c32 \u03c31 is completely determined by its restriction\nto a point, say, x0 , in the dense open orbit U0 \u2282 U\u03c31 \u2229 U\u03c32 . Together with the\nlocal splitting propertities in (1) above, in fact \u03c6\u03c32 \u03c31 is a regular matrix-valued\nfunction on U\u03c31 \u2229 U\u03c32 . Pasting maps also have to satisfy the cocycle condition :\n\u03c6\u03c33 \u03c31 = \u03c6\u03c33 \u03c32 \u25e6 \u03c6\u03c32 \u03c31 over U\u03c31 \u2229 U\u03c32 \u2229 U\u03c33 for every triple of \u03c31 , \u03c32 , \u03c33 in \u03a3.\nThis implies that the full set of pasting maps between affine charts of X\u03a3 is\ndetermined by the set of pasting maps \u03c6\u03c32 \u03c31 with \u03c31 , \u03c32 \u2208 \u03a3(n) that satisfy\nthe cocycle condition.\nThese observations lead to Kaneyama's data for equivariant vector bundles over X\u03a3 .\nThe bundle data and the classification after Kaneyama.\n(a) The data of local trivialization : a collection of weight systems.\nFor \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3(n), x\u03c3 is a fixed point of the toric action; thus Ex\u03c3 is an invariant fiber of\nthe lifted toric action. Associated to the representation of Tn on Ex\u03c3 is the weight system\nW\u03c3 \u2282 M . W\u03c3 determones the local trivialization of E|U\u03c3 : E|U\u03c3 = \u2295\u03c7\u2208W\u03c3 U\u03c3 \u00d7 E\u03c3\u03c7 .\n(b) The data of pasting : net of weight systems and pasting maps.\nThese weight systems must satisfy a compatibility condition as follows. Let \u03c4 =\n\u03c31 \u2229 \u03c32 \u2208 \u03a3(n \u2212 1) be the common codimension-1 wall of two maximal cones \u03c31 and \u03c32 ,\nthen the stabilizer Stab (x\u03c4 ) of x\u03c4 is an (n \u2212 1)-subtorus in TN associated to the sublattice\nin N spanned by \u03c4 . Associated to the representation of Stab (x\u03c4 ) on the fiber Ex\u03c4 is a\nweight system W\u03c4 \u2282 M/M (\u03c4 ), where M (\u03c4 ) = \u03c4 \u22a5 \u2229M . The projection map M \u2192 M/M (\u03c4 )\ninduces the maps\n\u03c0\u03c4 \u03c3\n\u03c0\u03c4 \u03c3\nW\u03c31 \u2212\u21921 W\u03c4 \u2190\u22122 W\u03c32\nbetween weight systems. Since they correspond to the refinement of the Stab (\u03c4 )-weight\nspaces to the TN -weight spaces, the holomorphicity requiremnent of equivariant pasting\n5\n\n\fmaps implied that both of these maps are surjective. Thus, { W\u03c3 | \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3(n) } form a net\nof weight systems. Figure 2-1 indicates how the net of weight systems may look like for\n\u03a3 that comes from the normal cone of a strong convex polyhedron \u2206 in M .\n\n2\n\nv\n\n1\n\n2\n\ne\nv\n\n1\n\n\u2206\nFigure 2-1. For \u03a3 being a normal fan of a convex polyhedron in\nM , the weight system W can be realized as a collection of vectors\n(weights) at the vertices and the barycenter of the edges of \u2206.\nThe compatibility condition is translated into the condition that,\nfor vertices v\u03c31 and v\u03c32 connected by an edge e\u03c4 of \u2206, the three\nsets W\u03c31 , W\u03c4 , and W\u03c32 have to match up under the projection\nalong the direction parallel to e\u03c4 .\nThe equivariant pasting maps are given by a map\nP : \u03a3(n) \u00d7 \u03a3(n) \u2212\u2192 GL (r, C)\nthat satisfies\nP (\u03c33 , \u03c32 ) P (\u03c32 , \u03c31 ) = P (\u03c33 , \u03c31 ) .\nP gives a set of compatible pasting maps for the fiber Ex0 in different E|U\u03c3 with respect\nto the bases given by the weight space decomposition. Holomorphicity condition for its\nequivariant extension to over U\u03c31 \u2229 U\u03c32 requires that:\nFor any \u03c4 = \u03c31 \u2229 \u03c32 \u2208 \u03a3(n \u2212 1), let W\u03c3i = (\u03c7\u03c3i 1 , * * * , \u03c7\u03c3i r ), written with\nmultiplicity given by the dimension of the corresponding weight space. Then\nP (\u03c32 , \u03c31 )ij = 0 if \u03c7\u03c32 i \u2212 \u03c7\u03c31 j \u2208 M \u2212 \u03c4 \u2228 .\n(c) Equivalence of the bundle data.\nGiven \u03a3, two bundle data (W, P ) and (W \u2032 , P \u2032 ) are said to be equivariant if W = W \u2032\nand there is a map \u03c1 : \u03a3(n) \u2192 GL (r, C) such that P \u2032 (\u03c32 , \u03c31 ) = \u03c1(\u03c32 )P (\u03c32 , \u03c31 )\u03c1(\u03c31 )\u22121 .\nEquivariant data determine isomorphic linearized equivariant vector bundles over X\u03a3 .\n\n6\n\n\f3\n\nThe splitting type of an equivariant vector bundle.\n\nRecall first a theorem of Grothendieck ([Gro] Theorem 2.1), which says that any holomorphic vector bundle over CP1 splits into the direct sum of a unique set of line bundles. The\nfollowing definition follows from [L-L-Y2]:\nDefinition 3.1 [splitting type]. Let E be an equivariant vector bundle of rank r over a\ntoric manifold X\u03a3 . Suppose that there exist nontrivial equivariant line bundles L1 , * * * , Lr\nover X\u03a3 such that each c1 (Li ) is either \u2265 0 or < 0 and that the restriction E|V (\u03c4 ) is\nisomorphic to the direct sum (\u2295ri=1 Li )|V (\u03c4 ) for any \u03c4 \u2208 \u03a3(n \u2212 1). Then {L1 , * * * , Lr } is\ncalled a splitting type of E.\nDefinition 3.2 [system of splitting numbers]. For each \u03c4 \u2208 \u03a3(n \u2212 1), suppose that\nE|V (\u03c4 ) = \u2295ri=1 O(d\u03c4i ) with\n\nd\u03c41 \u2265 d\u03c42 \u2265 * * * \u2265 d\u03c4r .\n\nFrom Grothendieck's theorem, (d\u03c41 , * * * , d\u03c4r ) is uniquely determined by E. We shall call\nthe set\n\u039e (E) = { (d\u03c41 , * * * , d\u03c4r ) | \u03c4 \u2208 \u03a3(n \u2212 1) }\nthe system of splitting numbers associated to E.\nTo compute the splitting types of E, we first extract the bundle data of E|V (\u03c4 ) from\nthat of E and then compute \u039e (E) from the bundle data of E|V (\u03c4 ) by weight bootstrapping.\nUsing these numbers, one can then determine all the splitting types of E by the augmented\nintersection matrix Q associated to \u03a3. Let us now turn to the details.\nWe shall assume that the rank r of E \u2265 2.\nThe bundle data of E|V (\u03c4 ) .\nLet \u03c4 = \u03c31 \u2229 \u03c32 \u2208 \u03a3(n \u2212 1), E = E|V (\u03c4 ) , U1 = U\u03c31 \u2229 V (\u03c4 ), and U2 = U\u03c31 \u2229 V (\u03c4 ). Let v\u03c4 be\na lattice point in the interior of \u03c4 , then the pasting map \u03c621 (x\u03c4 ) for E from E|U1 to E|U2\nover x\u03c4 is given by limz\u21920 (\u03bbv\u03c4 (z)P (\u03c32 , \u03c31 )\u03bbv\u03c4 (z)\u22121 ), where z \u2208 C\u2217 . Since Stab (V (\u03c4 ))\nacts on E via the TN -action on E and the pasting map for E is TN -equivariant and,\nhence, commutes with the Stab (V (\u03c4 ))-action, E can be decomposed into a direct sum of\nStab (V (\u03c4 ))-weight subbundles:\nE = \u2295\u03c7\u2208W\u03c4 E \u03c7 .\n\u2032\n\nIndeed, for \u03c7 \u2208 W\u03c4 , E \u03c7 |U1 = \u2295\u03c7\u2032 \u2208\u03c0\u03c4\u22121\u03c3 (\u03c7) U1 \u00d7 E\u03c3\u03c71 ; and similarly for E \u03c7 |U2 . Thus, up to a\n1\npermutation of elements in the basis, we may assume that \u03c621 (x\u03c4 ) is in a block diagonal\nform with each block labelled by a distinct \u03c7 \u2208 W\u03c4 . Let us now turn to the weight system\nfor E at x\u03c31 and x\u03c32 .\n\n7\n\n\fLet \u03c4\u03c3\u22a51 be the primitive lattice point of \u03c31\u2228 \u2229 \u03c4 \u22a5 in M and v\u03c31 be a lattice point in N\nsuch that h\u03c4\u03c3\u22a51 , v\u03c31 i = 1. Let \u03bbv\u03c31 be the corresponding one-parameter subgroup in TN .\nThen \u03bbv\u03c31 acts on O\u03c4 freely and transitively with limz\u21920 \u03bbv\u03c31 (z) * x\u03c4 = x\u03c31 . Let\nW\u03c31 = { \u03c7\u03c31 1 , \u03c7\u03c31 2 , * * * }\n\nand W\u03c32 = { \u03c7\u03c32 1 , \u03c7\u03c32 2 , * * * }\n\nbe the set of TN -weights at x\u03c31 and x\u03c32 respectively. Then, as a \u03bbv\u03c31 -equivariant bundle\nwith the induced linearization from the linearization of E, the corresponding \u03bb\u03c31 -weights\nof Ex\u03c31 and Ex\u03c32 are given respectively by\n1\n\nW\u03c3T1 = { h\u03c7\u03c31 1 , v\u03c31 i, h\u03c7\u03c31 2 , v\u03c31 i, * * * } and\n\n1\n\nW\u03c3T2 = { h\u03c7\u03c32 1 , v\u03c31 i, h\u03c7\u03c32 2 , v\u03c31 i, * * * } .\n\nNotice that both sets depend on the choice of v\u03c31 ; however, different choices of v\u03c31 will\n1\n1\nlead only to an overall shift of W\u03c3T1 \u222a W\u03c3T2 by an integer.\nFrom bundle data to splitting numbers : weight bootstrapping.\nRecall first the following fact by Grothendieck [Gro]:\nFact 3.3 [Grothendieck]. Given a holomorphic vector bundle E of rank r over CP1 .\nLet E0 = {0} \u2282 E1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Er = E be a filtration of E such that Ei /Ei\u22121 is a line bundle\nfor 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r and that the degree di of Ei /Ei\u22121 form a non-increasing sequence. Then E\nis isomorphic to the direct sum \u2295ri=1 (Ei /Ei\u22121 ).\nFollowing previous discussions and notations, we only need to work out the splitting\nnumbers for each E \u03c7 . Thus, without loss of generality, we may assume that W\u03c4 = \u03c7 in\nthe following discussion.\nFix a v\u03c31 . Note that in terms of the one-parameter subgroup \u03bbv\u03c31 acting on V (\u03c4 ), x\u03c31\nhas coordinate 0 while x\u03c32 has coordinate \u221e. Let\nE|U1 = \u2295ai=1 U1 \u00d7 E1\u03c71i\n\nand\n\n\u03c7\n\nE|U2 = \u2295bj=1 U2 \u00d7 E2 2j\n\nbe the induced T1 -weight space decomposition of E|U1 and E|U2 respectively, and \u03c612 (x\u03c4 )\nbe the pasting map at x\u03c4 from (E|U1 )|x\u03c4 to (E|U2 )|x\u03c4 . We assume that \u03c711 > * * * > \u03c71a\nand \u03c721 < * * * < \u03c72b . Our goal is now to work out a filtration of E, using the given bundle\ndata, that satisfies the property in the above fact.\nLet v be a non-zero vector in the fiber Ex\u03c4 over x\u03c4 . Then associated to the T1 -orbit\nT1 * v of v is a line bundle Lv that contains T1 * v as a meromorphic section sv . Let\n\u03c7 \u2032\n\u03c7\nv1 1i\u2032 be the lowest T1 -weight component of v in E|U1 and v2 2j ) be the highest T1 -weight\n\u2032\n\u03c7 \u2032\ncomponent of v in E|U2 . Then Lv |x\u03c31 (resp. Lv |x\u03c32 ) lies in E1\u03c71 i (resp. E2 2j ) and the\nmeromorphic section sv is holomorphic over O\u03c4 with a zero at x\u03c31 (resp. x\u03c32 ) of order \u03c71i\u2032\n(resp. \u2212\u03c72j \u2032 ). (Here, a zero of order \u2212k means the same as a pole of order k.) This shows\nthat\nLv = O(\u03c71i\u2032 \u2212 \u03c72j \u2032 ) .\n8\n\n\fNotice that, from the previous discussion, this degree is independent of the choices of v\u03c31 .\nWe shall now proceed to construct a T1 -equivariant line subbundle in E that achieves the\nmaximal degree.\nFix a basis for the T1 -weight spaces in the local trivialization of E, then \u03c621 (x\u03c4 ) is\nexpressed by a matrix A which admits a weight-block decomposition A = [ A\u03c72j ,\u03c71i ]ji .\nConsider the chain of submatrices Bkl in A that consists of weight blocks A\u03c72j ,\u03c71i with\nj = k, * * * , b and i = 1, * * * , l, as indicated in Figure 3-1. Each Bkl gives the linear map\n\n\u03c7 1l\n\u03c7 2k\n\nBkl\n\nFigure 3-1. The submatrix Bkl of A, which consists of weight\nblocks, are indicated by the shaded part.\n\u03c7\n\nfrom \u2295li=1 E1\u03c71i to \u2295bj=k E2 2j induced by A. Let Nkl be the kernel of Bkl , as a subspace in\n(E|U1 )x\u03c4 . Define\nEi = E1\u03c711 \u2295 * * * \u2295 E1\u03c71i\n\nat x\u03c4 ,\n\ni = 1, * * * , a .\n\nThen one has the following sequence of filtrations:\n{0} \u2282\n\nE1\n\n\u2282 *** \u2282\n\nEa = (E|U1 )x\u03c4\n\n\u222a\n***\n\u222a\nNb1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Nba\n\u222a\n..\n.\n\u222a\n\n***\n..\n.\n***\n\n\u222a\n..\n.\n\u222a\n\nN11 \u2282 * * * \u2282 N1a\n\n.\n\nLet\nEij = Ei \u2212 Ei\u22121 \u2212 Nji ,\n\nfor i = 1, * * * , a , j = 1, * * * , b ;\n\nthen\n(E|U1 )x\u03c4 = \u222ai,j Eij .\nBy construction, if Eij is non-empty, then, for any v in Eij , deg (Lv ) = \u03c71i \u2212 \u03c72j . Thus we\nmay define the characteristic number \u03bc(Eij ) for Eij non-empty to be \u03c71i + \u03c72j . Now let\nd1 = max { \u03bc(Eij ) | Eij non-empty, i = 1, * * * , a, j = 1, * * * , b }\n9\n\n\fand v \u2208 Eij for some (ij) that realizes d1 ; then by construction E1 = Lv is a T1 -equivariant\nline subbundle of E that achieves the maximal possible degree.\nSuppose the basis for the weight spaces in the local trivialization of E are given by\nP\n(e11 , * * * , e1r ) and (e21 , * * * , e2r ) respectively. Let v = ki=1 ci e1i with ck 6= 0 in E|U1 and\nP \u2032\nv = ki=1 c\u2032i e2i with c\u2032k\u2032 6= 0 in E|U2 . Then, by replacing e1k and e2k\u2032 by v and putting it\nas the first element in the bases, one shows\nLemma 3.4. There exist a new weight space decomposition of E|U1 and E|U2 respectively\nand a choice of the basis for the new weight spaces such that E1 |x\u03c4 is spanned by the first\nelement in the basis.\nThis renders the pasting map into the form:\nA =\n\n\"\n\n1 \u2217\n0 A1\n\n#\n\n,\n\nwhere 0 is the (r \u2212 1)-dimensional zero vector and A1 is a nondegenerate (r \u2212 1) \u00d7 (r \u2212 1)\nmatrix. With respect to the new trivialization, the T1 -weight spaces and their basis\ndescends then to the quotient E/E1 with pasting map given by A1 .\nRepeating the discussion r times, one obtains T1 -equivariant line subbundles\nE1 \u2282 E ,\n\nE2 /E1 \u2282 E/E1 ,\n\n*** ,\n\nEr\u22121 /Er\u22122 \u2282 E/Er\u22122 ,\n\nEr /Er\u22121 .\n\nof maximal degree in each pair and the associated filtration\nE0 = {0} \u2282 E1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Er = E .\nLemma 3.5. The filtration of E obtained above satisfies the condition of Grothendieck in\nFact 3.3.\nProof. Since Ei /Ei\u22121 is a T1 -equivariant line subbundle of maximal degree in E/Ei\u22121 , it\nmust be so also in Ei+1 /Ei\u22121 . Together with the fact that Ei+1 /Ei = (Ei+1 /Ei\u22121 )/(Ei /Ei\u22121 ),\nwe only need to justify the claim for the rank 2 case. Thus, assume that E is of rank 2 and\nthe filtration is given by {0} \u2282 E1 \u2282 E. By Lemma 3.4, we may choose a basis compatibe with the T1 -weight space decomposition and the filtration such that the pasting map\n\u03c6\u221e0 and its inverse are given respectively by the following matrices with the T1 -weight\nindicated:\n\nA =\n\n\"\n\n\u03c711 \u03c712\n1 \u2217\n0 1\n\n#\n\n\u03c721\n\u03c722\n\nand\n\nA\u22121 =\n\n\"\n\n\u03c721 \u03c722\n1 \u2212\u2217\n0\n1\n\n#\n\n\u03c711\n\u03c712\n\n.\n\nThis implies that deg E1 = \u03c711 \u2212\u03c721 and deg (E/E1 ) = \u03c712 \u2212\u03c722 . The linear independency\nof the line bundles associated to the column vectors of A at z = 0 requires that \u03c722 \u2265 \u03c721 .\n10\n\n\fSimilarly, the linear independency of the line bundles associated to the column vectors\nof A\u22121 at z = \u221e requires that \u03c712 \u2264 \u03c711 . Consequently, deg E1 \u2265 deg (E/E1 ). This\nconcludes the proof.\n\u2737\nConsequently, by Fact 3.3 one obtains the decomposition of E as the direct sum of line\nbundles and the splitting numbers.\nRemark 3.6 [ weight matching ]. For \u03c4 = \u03c31 \u2229 \u03c32 \u2208 \u03a3(n \u2212 1), if all the Stab (x\u03c4 )-weight\nspaces are 1-dimensional, then up to a permutation of the elements in bases, the pasting\nmap \u03c621 (x\u03c4 ) becomes diagonal and the correpondences W\u03c31 \u2192 W\u03c4 \u2190 W\u03c32 are bijective.\nLet \u03c7\u03c31 i \u2192 \u03c7\u03c4 i \u2190 \u03c7\u03c32 i , i = 1, * * * , r, be the correpondences of weights. Then, up to a\npermutation, the splitting number of E over V (\u03c4 ) is given by\n( h\u03c7\u03c31 1 \u2212 \u03c7\u03c32 1 , v\u03c31 i , * * * , h\u03c7\u03c31 r \u2212 \u03c7\u03c32 r , v\u03c31 i ) ,\nwhere recall that \u03c4\u03c3\u22a51 = \u03c4 \u22a5 \u2229 \u03c31\u2228 and h\u03c4\u03c3\u22a51 , v\u03c31 i = 1.\nFrom the system of splitting numbers to the splitting types of E .\nFollowing the notation in Sec. 1, let \u03a3(n \u2212 1) = { \u03c41 , * * * , \u03c4I } and\n\u039e (E) = { (d\u03c41i , * * * , d\u03c4ri ) | i = 1, * * * , r } .\nbe the system of splitting numbers associated to E. Let R be the I \u00d7 r matrix whose i-th\nrow is (d\u03c41i , * * * , d\u03c4ri ). Recall the augmented intersection matrix Q from Sec. 1. Then the\nproblem of finding splitting types of E is equivalent to finding out matrices R\u2032 obtained\nby row-wise permutations of R such that:\n(1) Each column of R\u2032 has only all positive, all zero, or all negative entries.\n(2) The following matrix linear equation has an integral solution:\nQ X = R\u2032 ,\nwhere X is an J \u00d7 r matrix.\nLet Xkl be the (k, l)-entry of X. Then associated to the r-many column vectors of the\nP\nsolution matrix X are the line bundles Ll represented by Jk=1 Xkl D(vk ), for l = 1, * * * , r.\nFrom Fact 1.2 in Sec.1, Condition (1) above for R\u2032 means that c1 (Ll ) is either \u2265 0 or < 0.\nSuch set of line bundles gives then a splitting type of E by construction. If there exist no\nsuch (R\u2032 , X), then E does not admit a splitting type. Finding all such R\u2032 and solving the\nmatrix X can be achieved by using a computer.\n\n11\n\n\f4\n\nThe splitting type of some examples.\n\nIn this section, we compute the splitting types of some equivaraint vector bundles over\ntoric manifolds to illustrate the ideas in previous sections and also for future use. The\ndetails of the toric manifolds used here can be found in [Fu] and [Od2].\nExample 4.1 [equivariant vector bundles of rank 2 over CP2 ]. Recall first ([Fu])\nthe toric data for CP2 , as illustrated in Figure 4-1(a). Let E be an indecomposable\nequivariant vector bundle of rank 2 over CP2 = Proj (C[u0 , u1 , u2 ]). From [Ka1], E is\nisomorphic to Ea,b,c,n = E(a, b, c) \u2297 O(n) or its dual bundle for some positive integers\na, b, c and integer n, where E(a, b, c) is the rank 2 bundle defined by the exact sequence\n0 \u2212\u2192 OCP2\n1\n\n\u2212\u2192 O(a) \u2295 O(b) \u2295 O(c) \u2212\u2192 E(a, b, c) \u2212\u2192 0\n( ua0 , ub1 , uc2 )\n\n7\u2212\u2192\n\n.\n\nFrom the bundle data of E(a, b, c) as worked out in [Ka1], the weight systems for E(a, b, c)\nat the distinguished points x\u03c31 , x\u03c31 and x\u03c33 are given respectively by (cf.

In (a), the fan and its dual cones for CP2 are illustrated. In (b), the weight systems W1 , W2 , W3 associated to\nE(a, b, c), a, b, c positive integers, are illustrated.\n\nComparing with the toric data for CP2 and following the discussions in Sec. 3, in\nparticular Remark 3.6, one has\nE(a, b, c)|x\u03c31 x\u03c32 = O(a + c) \u2295 O(b) ,\nE(a, b, c)|x\u03c31 x\u03c33 = O(b + c) \u2295 O(a) .\n\nE(a, b, c)|x\u03c32 x\u03c33 = O(a + b) \u2295 O(c) ,\n\nand\n\nConsequently,\nE|x\u03c31 x\u03c32 = O(a + c + n) \u2295 O(b + n) ,\n\nE|x\u03c32 x\u03c33 = O(a + b + n) \u2295 O(c + n) ,\n\nE|x\u03c31 x\u03c33 = O(b + c + n) \u2295 O(a + n) .\n12\n\nand\n\n\fThus, up to permutations, the system of splitting numbers associated to E is\n\u039e (E) = { (a + c + n, b + n), (a + b + n, c + n), (b + c + n, a + n) }\nand\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f9\n\na+c+n b+n\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\nR = \uf8f0 a+b+n c+n \uf8fb .\nb+c+n a+n\n\nFrom Figure 4-1(a), the augmented intersection matrix Q for CP2 is given by\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f9\n\n1 1 1\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\nQ = \uf8f0 1 1 1 \uf8fb.\n1 1 1\n\nPerforming row-wise permutations to R, one obtains four possible R\u2032 , up to overall permutations of column vectors. Solving the matrix equation QX = R\u2032 , one concludes that\nCorollary. For the indecomposable equivaraint rank 2 bundle Ea,b,c,n over CP2 to admit a\nsplitting type, one must have a = b = c. In this case, the splitting type of Ea,a,a,n is unique\nand is given by ( O(2a + n), O(a + n) ).\nThis concludes the example.\n\u2737\nExample 4.2 [(co)tangent bundle of toric manifolds]. Notice that, since T\u2217 X and\nT \u2217 X are dual to each other, their splitting types are negative to each other. Thus, we\nonly need to consider T\u2217 X. Let us compute first the splitting numbers of T\u2217 X\u03a3 . Let\n\u03c4 = \u03c31 \u2229 \u03c32 \u2208 \u03a3(n \u2212 1) with\n\u03c31 = [v1 , * * * , vn\u22121 , vn ] and\n\n\u03c32 = [v1 , * * * , vn\u22121 , vn\u2032 ] .\n\nThese vertices in \u03c31 \u222a \u03c32 satisfy a linear equation of the form\nvjn + vjn\u2032 + a1 vj1 + * * * + an\u22121 vjn\u22121 = 0 ,\nfor some unique integers a1 , * * * , an determined by \u03c31 \u222a \u03c32 . Let (e1 , * * * , en ) be the dual\nbasis in M with respect to (v1 , * * * , vn ). Then\n\u03c31\u2228 = [e1 , * * * , en\u22121 , en ] and\n\n\u03c32\u2228 = [e1 \u2212 a1 en , * * * , en\u22121 \u2212 an\u22121 en , \u2212en ] .\n\nConsequently, \u03c7\u03c31 i = ei for i = 1, * * * , n, \u03c7\u03c32 i = ei \u2212 ai en for i = 1, * * * , n \u2212 1; and\n\u03c7\u03c32 n = \u2212en . Choosing v\u03c31 = vn and by the discussion in Sec. 3, one concludes that the\nsplitting number of T\u2217 X\u03a3 over V (\u03c4 ) is given by\n( a1 , * * * , an\u22121 , 2 ) ,\n13\n\n\fup to a permutation. Thus, the system \u039e (T\u2217 X\u03a3 ) of spliting numbers associated to T\u2217 X\u03a3\nis already coded in \u03a3, as it should be.\nIn the dual picture, if X\u03a3 is projective and, hence, \u03a3 is realized as the normal fan of a\nstrongly convex polyhedron \u2206 in M . Let m\u03c3 be the vertex of \u2206 associated to \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3(n).\nThen W\u03c3 is the set of primitive vectors that generate the tangent cone of \u2206 at m\u03c3 . If\n\u03c4 = \u03c31 \u2229 \u03c32 \u2208 \u03a3(n \u2212 1), then m\u03c31 and m\u03c32 are connected by an edge m\u03c31 m\u03c32 of \u2206 that\nis parallel to \u03c4 \u22a5 . Thus the projection M \u2192 M/M (\u03c4 ) is given by the projection along\nthe m\u03c31 m\u03c32 -direction. The strong convexity of \u2206 implies that W\u03c31 and W\u03c32 match up\nbijectively under this projection. Thus \u039e (X\u03a3 ) can be also read off directly from \u2206.\nWe can now compute the splitting type of some concrete examples. The result shows\nthat : Not every tangent bundle of a toric manifold admits a splitting type.\n(a) The projective space CPn . Let (v1 , * * * , vn ) be a basis of N and vn+1 = \u2212(v1 * * * vn )\nand \u03a3 be the fan whose maximal cones are generated by every independent n elements in\n{ v1 , * * * vn+1 }. Then CPn = X\u03a3 . By construction, \u03a3(1) is given by {v1 , * * * , vn+1 } with\nv1 + * * * vn+1 = 0. Thus the splitting number for T\u2217 CPn over any invariant CP1 is given\nby\n( 2, 1, * * * , 1 ) .\n|\n\n{z\n\nn\u22121\n\n}\n\nThe augmented intersection matrix Q has all of its entries equal to 1. From this, one\nconcludes that the splitting type of CPn is unique and is given by\n( O(2), O(1), * * * , O(1) ) .\n|\n\n{z\n\nn\u22121\n\n}\n\n(b) The Hirzebruch surface Fa . The toric data for the Hurzebruch Fa and its weighted\ncircular graph [Od2] is given in Figure 4-2.\n0\n\n-a\n\n(-1, a)\n\n0\n\na\n\nFigure 4-2. The fan for the Hirzebruch surface Fa and its weights.\nConsequently,\n\u039e (T\u2217 Fa ) = { (2, 0), (2, a), (2, 0), (2, \u2212a) }\n\n14\n\n\fand its augmented intersection matrix is given by\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\nQ = \uf8ef\n\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\n1\na\n1\n0\n\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1 \u2212a\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa.\n\uf8fb\n\nThus, the only Hirzebruch surface whose tangent bundle can admit a splitting type is when\na = 0 since the line bundle in a splitting type must be either positive or negative. For\na = 0, F0 = CP1 \u00d7 CP1 . Let H 2 (CP1 \u00d7 CP1 , Z) = Z \u2295 Z from the product structure. Then\ndirect computations as in Example 4.1 concludes that T\u2217 (F0 ) admits a unique splitting\ntype\n( O(2, 2), O(F0 ) ) ,\nwhere O(2, 2) is the line bundle associated to (2, 2) in H 2 (F0 , Z) and O(F0 ) is the trivial\nline bundle.\n(c) The blowups of CP2 or Fa . Recall from [Fu] and [Od2] that every complete nonsingular\ntoric surface X is obtained from CP2 or Fa , a > 0, by a succession of blowups at the TN fixed points. Let (a1 , * * * , as ) be the sequence of weights that appear in the weighted\ncircular graph for X. Then\n\u039e (T\u2217 X) = { (2, a1 ), * * * , (2, as ) } .\nConsequently, a necessary condition for T\u2217 X to admit a splitting type is that the weights\nthat appear in the graph must be all positive, all zero, or all negative. The augmented\nintersection matrix is given by\n\uf8ee\n\na1 1\n\uf8ef 1 a\n2\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n1\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\nQ = \uf8ef\n\n1\n1\na3\n..\n.\n\n1\n..\n.\n1\n\n1\n\n..\n\n.\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa,\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n1 \uf8fb\n\nan\u22121\n1\nan\n\nwhere all the missing entries are 0. From these data, the splitting type of T\u2217 X, if exists,\ncan be worked out.\nTo provide more examples and also for the interest of string theory, equivariant blowups\nof CP2 up to 9 points that admits a splitting type are searched out by computer. These\ninclude del Pezzo type and 21 K3 type surfaces. It turns out that there are only 8 of them,\n4 of del Pezzo type and 4 of 12 K3 type.

Let [z0 : * * * , zn ]\nbe the homogeneous coordinates of the projective space CPn . Recall from [Ka2] that an\nindecomposable equivariant vector bundle E of rank n over CPn is isomorphic to either\nE \u2297 OCPn (d) or E \u2217 \u2297 OCPn (d) for some integer d where E is the equivariant vector bundle\ndefined by the exact sequence\n\u03b7\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 OCPn \u2212\u2192 \u2295ni=0 OCPn (mi ) \u2212\u2192 E \u2212\u2192 0 ,\nwhere mi are positive integers and \u03b7 sends 1 to (z0m0 , * * * , znmn ). Since the (n + 1)n/2\nmany invariant CP1 in CPn are given by\nVij = {[ 0, * * * , 0, zi , 0, * * * , 0, zj , 0, * * * , 0 ] | (zi , zj ) \u2208 C2 \u2212 {(0, 0)}} ,\n0 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n, the above exact sequence, when restricted to Vij , reduces to\n0 \u2212\u2192 OVij\n1\n\n\u2212\u2192\n7\u2212\u2192 ( 0, * * * , 0,\n\n\u2295r+1\nk=1 OVij (mk )\nzimi ,\n\n0, * * * , 0,\n\n\u2212\u2192 E|Vij\n\nm\nzj j ,\n\n\u2212\u2192 0\n\n0, * * * , 0 )\n\n.\n\nIt follows from the multiplicativity of total Chern class that\n\\\nE|Vij \u2243 OCP1 (mi +mj ) \u2295 OCP1 (m0 ) \u2295 * * * \u2295 OC\\\nP1 (mi ) \u2295 * * * \u2295 OCP1 (mj ) \u2295 * * * \u2295 OCP1 (mn )\n\nand, hence, the system of splitting numbers of E is\nci , * * * , m\ncj , * * * , mn ) | 0 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n } ,\n\u039e (E) = { (mi + mj , m0 , * * * , m\n\nwhere terms with b are deleted. The augmented matrix in this case is\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f9\n\n1 *** 1\n\uf8ef ..\n\uf8fa\nQ = \uf8f0 . ... ... \uf8fb .\n1 *** 1\n\nWithout loss of generality, one may assume that 0 < m0 \u2264 * * * \u2264 mn , then mi < mn +mn\u22121\nfor all i. Consequently, with the notation from Sec. 3, for QX = R\u2032 to have a solution,\n1\n\nWe thank Bong H. Lian for drawing our attention to this and the reference [Ja]\n\n17\n\n\fone must have mi + mj = mn + mn\u22121 for all i < j, which implies that m0 = * * * = mn .\nOne concludes therefore\nCorollary. For the indecomposable equivaraint rank n bundle E = E \u2297 OCPn (d) over CPn\nto admit a splitting type, one must have m0 = * * * = mn . In this case, the splitting type of\nE is unique and is given by ( OCPn (2m0 + d), * * * , OCPn (m0 + d) ).\nThis generalizes Example 4.1. Note also that the case m0 = * * * = mn = 1 with d = 0\ncorresponds to T\u2217 CPn and the above discussion double-checks part of Example 4.2.\n\u2737\nOne can generalize this example slightly to toric manifolds as follows. First, let us\nstate a lemma, whose proof is straightforward.\nLemma 5.2 Given an exact sequence\n\u03b7\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 OCP1 \u2212\u2192 OCP1 \u2295 (\u2295ri=1 OCP1 (mi )) \u2212\u2192 E \u2212\u2192 0 ,\nwhere \u03b7(1) = (s0 , s1 , * * * , sr ), such that s0 is non-zero. Then E \u2243 \u2295ri=1 OCP1 (mi ).\nGiven a toric n-fold X\u03a3 , consider now the exact sequence\n\u03b7\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 OX\u03a3 \u2212\u2192 \u2295r+1\ni=1 OX\u03a3 (Di ) \u2212\u2192 E \u2212\u2192 0 .\nThe restriction of the sequence to V (\u03c4 ), \u03c4 \u2208 \u03a3(n \u2212 1), is given by\n\u03b7\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 OCP1 \u2212\u2192 \u2295r+1\ni=1 OCP1 (Di * V (\u03c4 )) \u2212\u2192 E \u2212\u2192 0 .\nIf this exact sequence is of the kind in Example 5.1 or Lemma 5.2 for all \u03c4 \u2208 \u03a3(n \u2212 1),\nthen \u039e (E) can be readily obtained and the splitting type of such E, if exists, can then\nbe determined. Inspired from Example 5.1, to realize this, recall the Cox homogeneous\ncoordinates of X\u03a3 from [Co] (cf. Sec. 1): let a = |\u03a3(1)|, then X\u03a3 can be realized as a\nquotient X\u03a3 = (C\u03a3(1) \u2212 Z(\u03a3))/G. Let (z1 , * * * , za ) be the standard coordinates of Ca and\n\u03c4 = [vj1 , * * * , vjn\u22121 ] \u2208 \u03a3(n\u22121), then V (\u03c4 ) can be realized as the quotient of the coordinate\nsubspace: V (\u03c4 ) = {zj1 = * * * = zjn\u22121 }/G. Furthermore, if \u03c4 = \u03c31 \u2229 \u03c32 , where\n\u03c31 = [vj1 , * * * , vjn\u22121 , vjn ] and\n\n\u03c32 = [vj1 , * * * , vjn\u22121 , vjn\u2032 ] ,\n\nthen [zjn : zjn\u2032 ] serves as a homogeneous coordinates for V (\u03c4 ) \u2243 CP1 . For all other\ni, {zi = 0} \u2229 {zj1 = * * * = zjn\u22121 } lies in the exceptional subset Z(\u03a3) and, hence, zi\nas an element in the homogeneous coordinate ring C[z1 , * * * , za ], graded by the Chow\ngroup An\u22121 (X\u03a3 ), descends to a non-zero section in OX\u03a3 (D(vi ))|V (\u03c4 ) \u2243 OCP1 . In general,\nsince OX\u03a3 (D1 ) \u2297 OX\u03a3 (D2 ) = OX\u03a3 (D1 + D2 ) for any Cartier T-Weil divisor D1 , D2 , for\nQ\nQ\n/ {j1 , * * * , jn\u22121 , jn , jn\u2032 } and \u03b1k positive integers, k zj\u03b1kk\nany monomial k zj\u03b1kk with jk \u2208\nP\ndescends to a non-zero section in OX\u03a3 ( k \u03b1k D(vjk ))|V (\u03c4 ) \u2243 OCP1 . This fact provides us\nwith a guideline for defining \u03b7 so that exact sequences as in Lemma 5.2 can appear when\n18\n\n\frestricted to invariant CP1 's in X\u03a3 . Such examples can be constructed plenty. Let us give\nan example below to illustrate the idea.\nExample 5.3 [simple rank 3 bundle over Hirzebruch surface]. Let X\u03a3 = Fa be a\nHirzebruch surface (cf. Example 4.2 (b)). Consider the rank 3 bundle E(m1 , m2 , m3 , m4 )\nover Fa defined by the exact sequence\n0 \u2212\u2192 OFa\n1\n\n\u2212\u2192\n7\u2212\u2192\n\n\u22954k=1 OFa (mk Dvk )\n( z1m1 ,\n\nz2m2 ,\n\nz3m3 ,\n\n\u2212\u2192 E(m1 , m2 , m3 , m4 ) \u2212\u2192 0\n\nz4m4 )\n\n,\n\nwhere mi are positive integers. From Lemma 5.2 and the discussions above, one concludes\nthat the system of splitting numbers of E(m1 , m2 , m3 , m4 ) is given by\n\u039e (E) = { (m1 , m2 , m4 ), (m1 , m2 , m3 ), (m2 , m3 , m4 ), (m1 , m3 , m4 ) } .\nRecall the augmented intersection matrix Q for Fa from Example 4.2 (b). Through a tedious but straightforward algebra, one can show that the only case when E(m1 , m2 , m3 , m4 )\nadmits a splitting type is when a = 0 (i.e. X = CP1 \u00d7 CP1 ) with m1 = m3 and m2 = m4 .\nIn this case, the splitting type is unique and is given by\nOCP1 \u00d7CP1 (m2 , m1 ) \u2295 OCP1 \u00d7CP1 (m1 , m2 ) \u2295 OCP1 \u00d7CP1 (m1 , m2 ) ,\nwhere we idetify Pic (X) with H2 (X, Z) \u2243 Z \u2295 Z, with generators\nOCP1 \u00d7CP1 (1, 0) 7\u2212\u2192 [CP1 \u00d7 \u2217] ,\n\nOCP1 \u00d7CP1 (0, 1) 7\u2212\u2192 [\u2217 \u00d7 CP1 ] .\n\u2737\n\nFor more general \u03b7, the restriction of the exact sequence over X\u03a3 to each invariant\nCP1 in X\u03a3 leads to an exact sequence of the form\n\u03b7\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 OCP1 \u2212\u2192 \u2295r+1\ni=1 OCP1 (mi ) \u2212\u2192 ECP1 \u2212\u2192 0 .\nA complete study of how \u03b7 determines the splitting of ECP1 as a direct sum of line bundles\nrequires more work2 .\nWe conclude the discussion of splitting types here and leave its further study and\napplications for another work.\n\n2\n\nWe thank Jason Starr for discussions on this and the references [Bri], [E-VV1], and [E-VV2].\n\n19\n\n\fAppendix.
