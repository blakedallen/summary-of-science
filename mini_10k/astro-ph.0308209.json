H. van GORKOM\nColumbia University, New York\n\nAbstract\nAlthough speculations of an interaction between galaxies and the ICM date back more than\nthirty years, the impact and importance of a possible interaction have long remained elusive. In recent years the situation has completely changed. A wealth of data and detailed\nhydrodynamical simulations have appeared that show the effects of interactions. Single dish\nobservations show that cluster galaxies are deficient in their neutral hydrogen content out\nto two Abell radii. The deficient galaxies tend to be on radial orbits. Detailed imaging of\nthe neutral hydrogen distribution in individual galaxies in two nearby clusters show a remarkable trend of H I extent with location in the cluster. These trends can be reproduced\nin simulations of ram pressure stripping by the ICM using SPH and full 3D hydro-codes.\nDetailed imaging of individual galaxies have found a number of galaxies with undisturbed\nstellar disks, truncated gas disks that are much smaller than the stellar disks, asymmetric\nextraplanar gas in the center and enhanced central star formation. These phenomena have\nall been predicted by hydrodynamical simulations. For the first time detailed observations\nof gas morphology and kinematics are used to constrain simulations. Simple models of ram\npressure stripping are consistent with the data for some galaxies, while for other galaxies\nmore than one mechanism must be at work. Optical imaging and spectroscopic surveys show\nthat small H I disks go together with truncated star forming disks, that hydrogen deficiency\ncorrelates with suppressed star formation rates and that the spatial extent of H I deficiency\nin clusters is matched by or even surpassed by the extent of reduced star formation rates.\nRecent volume limited imaging surveys of clusters in the local universe show that most\ngas rich galaxies are located in smaller groups and subclumps, that yet have to fall into the\nclusters. These groups form an ideal environment for interactions and mergers to occur and\nwe see much evidence for interactions between gas rich galaxies.\n\n1.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt has long been known that in the local universe the mix of morphological types\ndiffers in different galactic environments with ellipticals and S0's dominating in the densest\nclusters and spirals dominating the field population (Hubble and Humason 1931). This\nso called density-morphology relation has been quantified by Oemler (1974) and Dressler\n(1980) and is found to extend over five orders of magnitude in space density (Postman and\nGeller 1984). Whether this relation arises at formation (nature) or is caused by density\n\n\fJ. H. van Gorkom\ndriven evolutionary effects (nurture) remains a matter of debate. More recent studies of\nclusters of galaxies at intermediate redshifts show that both the morphological mix and the\nstar formation rate strongly evolve with redshift (Poggianti et al. 1999; Dressler et al. 1997;\nFasano et al. 2000). In particular the fraction of S0's goes down and the spiral fraction and\nstar formation rate go up with increasing redshift. There are many physical mechanisms at\nwork in clusters or during the growth of clusters that could affect the star formation rate and\npossibly transform spiral galaxies into S0's. In this review I will limit myself to the role that\nthe hot intracluster medium (ICM) may play.\nThe first suggestion that an interaction between the ICM and disk galaxies may affect\nthe evolution of these galaxies was made immediately after the first detection of an ICM\nin clusters (Gursky et al. 1971). In a seminal paper on \"the infall of matter into clusters\"\nGunn and Gott (1972) discuss what might happen if there is any intergalactic gas left after\nthe clusters has collapsed. The interstellar material in a galaxy would feel the ram pressure\nof the intracluster medium as it moves through the cluster. A simple estimate of the effect\nassumes that the outer disk gas gets stripped off when the local restoring force in the disk is\nsmaller than the ram pressure. Thus disks gets stripped up to the so called stripping radius\nwhere the forces balance. They estimate that for a galaxy moving at the typical velocity of\n1700 km/s through the Coma cluster the ISM would be stripped in one pass. This would\nexplain why so few normal spirals are seen in nearby clusters. In particular it would explain\nthe existence of so many gas poor, non star forming disk galaxies first noticed by Spitzer\nand Baade (1951) and later dubbed anemics by van den Bergh (1976).\nRam pressure stripping is but one way in which the ICM may affect the ISM. The effects of viscosity, thermal conduction and turbulence on the flow of hot gas past a galaxy\nwere considered by Nulsen (1982), who concluded that turbulent viscous stripping will be\nan important mechanism for gas loss from cluster galaxies. While the above mentioned\nmechanisms would work to remove gas from galaxies and thus slow down their evolution,\nan alternative possiblity is that an interaction with the ICM compresses the ISM and leads\nto ram pressure induced star formation (Dressler and Gunn, 1983; Gavazzi et al. 1995).\nOn the observational side there has long been evidence that spiral galaxies in clusters\nhave less neutral atomic hydrogen than galaxies of the same morphological type in the field\n(for a review see Haynes, Giovanelli and Chincarini 1984). The CO content however does\nnot seem to depend on environment (Stark et al. 1986; Kenney and Young 1989). Both\nsingle dish observations and synthesis imaging results of the Virgo cluster show that the HI\ndisks of galaxies in projection close to the cluster center are much smaller than the H I disks\nof galaxies in the outer parts (Giovanelli and Haynes, 1983; Warmels 1988a,b,c; Cayatte\net al. 1990, 1994). All of these phenomena could easily be interpreted in terms of ram\npressure stripping. Dressler (1986) made this even more plausible by pointing out that the\ngas deficient galaxies seem statistically to be mostly on radial orbits which would carry\nthem into the dense environment of the cluster core. However nature turned out to be more\ncomplicated than that. In a comprehensive analysis of HI data on six nearby clusters Magri\net al. (1988) conclude that the data can not be used to distinguish between inbred and\nevolutionary gas deficiency mechanisms or among different environmental effects. Although\nH I deficiency varies with projected radius from the cluster center, with the most H I poor\nobjects close to the cluster centers, no correlation is found between deficiency and (relative\nradial velocity)2, as would be expected from ram pressure stripping.\nIn more recent years a number of developments have taken place. First there was a flurry\n\n\fJ. H. van Gorkom\n\nFig. 1.1. Top: H I deficient fraction in bins of projected radius from the cluster\ncenter for the superposition of all the H I deficient clusters. Bottom: H I deficiency\nversus projected radius from the cluster center. Small dots show the radial variation\nof H I deficiency for individual galaxies, while the arrows indentify non detections\nplotted at their estimated lower limit. Large dots are the medians of the binned\nnumber distribution. From Solanes et al. 2001.\n\nof activity on the theoretical front, for the first time detailed numerical simulations on the\neffects of ram pressure stripping appeared. Since then both improved statistics on HI deficiency and detailed multiwavelengths observations of cluster galaxies undergoing trauma\nappeared. More recently detailed comparisons have been made between individual systems\nand numerical simulations. Finally synthesis imaging of neutral hydrogen no longer needs\nto be limited to a few selected systems in nearby clusters and results of volume limited surveys of entire clusters at redshifts between 0 and 0.2 have started to appear in the literature.\nIn this review I will first discuss what we have learned about the statistical properties of the\nH I content of cluster galaxies. Then I will review some of the recent numerical work that\nhas been done and compare these with observational results. After that I will discuss what\nwe have learned from imaging surveys, and in conclusion I will discuss the importance of\nthe ICM interaction for galaxy evolution.\n\n1.2\n\nThe Statistics of H I Deficiency\n\nThe most comprehensive survey on H I content in cluster galaxies to date is the\nwork by Solanes et al. 2001. These authors compiled H I data on 1900 spiral galaxies\nin 18 nearby clusters. The data are mostly obtained with the Arecibo telescope, a single\npixel telescope, and give information about the total amount of neutral hydrogen within the\nArecibo beam (3 arcmin) centered on optically selected galaxies. Galaxies are earmarked\nas belonging to a cluster when they fall within a projected distance of 5 Abell radii (RA ),\n\n\fJ. H. van Gorkom\n\nFig. 1.2. Radial run of normalized line of sight velocity dispersion for the composite H I deficient cluster. From Solanes et al. 2001.\ni.e. within 7.5 h \u22121 Mpc, from the cluster center and have a radial velocity that is less than\n3 times the average velocity dispersion from the cluster mean. Only clusters are included,\nfor which there are good H I data for at least ten galaxies within 1 RA of the cluster center.\nHI defiency is calculated according to the recipe of Haynes and Giovanelli (1984). It is the\nlog10 ( MH I observed/ MH I expected), where the expected H I mass is derived from a sample\nof isolated spirals of the same morphological type and optical diameter. To get significant\nstatistics the cluster sample is then divided in two groups, the deficient cluster sample, and\nthe non deficient cluster sample. The deficient sample contains all clusters for which the\nH I deficiency distribution over galaxies is significantly different within 1 RA from that of\nthe galaxies outside 1 RA . One of the most remarkable results of the analysis of that data\nbase is shown in Figure 1. It shows the H I deficient fraction, i.e. the fraction of galaxies\nwith a deficiency greater than 0.3, in bins of projected radius from the cluster center for\nthe superposition of all the H I deficient clusters. Galaxies with a deficiency greater than\n0.3, are galaxies that are deficient in neutral hydrogen by a factor two or more as compared\nto isolated galaxies of the same morphological type and size in the field. The percentage\nof H I deficient spirals increases monotonically going inward. What is surprising is that\nthis monotonic rise starts as far out as two RA . This suggests that the effect of the cluster\nenvironment can be felt out to two Abell radii, far beyond the reaches of the dense ICM.\nNo correlation is found for the fraction of H I deficient spirals (i.e. the number of spirals\nwith an H I deficiency DEF \u2265 0.30 within 1 RA of the cluster center compared to all galaxies\nof that type found in that region) with global cluster properties, such as X-ray luminosity,\nX-ray temperature, and radial velocity dispersion. As pointed out in the paper, this could be\na selection bias. If stripped spirals would lose all their gas they may be transformed into S0's\nand they would be left out from the statistics. It is somewhat plausible that this is indeed the\ncase since the fraction of spirals is clearly anti correlated with X-ray luminosity. The most\nimportant result of the paper apart from the extent of the occurrence of deficient galaxies\nis the correlation between deficiency and orbital parameters. This is shown in Figure 2. It\nshows for the composite deficient cluster the radial run of the line of sight velocity dispersion\n\n\fJ. H. van Gorkom\nfor the most deficient spirals, the non deficient spirals, for all spirals and for ellipticals\nand lenticulars. If galaxies are on radial orbits the measured velocity dispersion should\ndecrease at large distances from the cluster center. Although all spirals show a decrease in\nvelocity dispersion at large distances, this effect is by far the most pronounced in the H I\ndeficient spirals. The ellipticals and S0's have a constant velocity dispersion with radius.\nThis confirms the result by Dressler (1986). These results suggest that deficiency is most\npronounced when galaxies go through the dense cluster center at high velocities and as such\nsupport the idea that ram pressure stripping causes the deficiency.\n\n1.3\n\nSimulations\n\nIn the early seventies several papers appeared considering the effect of the ICM on\ngalaxies in clusters, e.g. ram pressure stripping (Gunn and Gott 1972), evaporation (Cowie\nand Songaila 1977) and turbulent viscosity and evaporation (Nulsen 1982). Not much work\nwas done though to connect theory with observations. The first paper that specifically looks\nat observational characteristics is the paper by Stevens, Acreman and Ponman (1999). This\npaper focusses on the impact of the ICM on an elliptical galaxy with a hot ISM and calculates\nthe observational signatures of this in the hot ICM, predicting bow-shocks, wakes and tails.\nSome, but still precious few, examples of structures that could be interpreted like this exist\nin the X-ray literature (Stevens et al. 1999). Observationally, there is much more evidence\nfor the impact of the ICM on the cool ISM of disk galaxies. From a view point of galaxy\nevolution this is also the more important question. In clusters star formation rates are known\nto evolve rapidly between intermediate redshifts and the local universe (Poggianti et al 1999,\nBalogh et al 1999). A mechanism is required to bring star formation almost completely to a\nhalt and a major issue is whether ram pressure stripping could do this to disk galaxies. The\noriginal analytical estimates of Gunn and Gott (1972) predict that gas gets stripped from\na galaxy up to a stripping radius within which the restoring force from the disk exceeds\nthe ram pressure. The first numerical simulations (Abadi, Moore and Bower (1999)) using\na 3 dimensional SPH/N-body simulation to study ram pressure stripping of gas from spiral\ngalaxies orbiting in clusters confirm that gas in disk galaxies gets stripped up to the stripping\nradius estimated by Gunn and Gott (1972). At small radii the potential provided by the\nbulge component contributes considerably. They estimate that a galaxy passing through\nthe center of Coma would have its gaseous disk truncated to \u2248 4 kpc, losing about 80 %\nof its gas. However the process is in general not efficient enough to account for the rapid\nand widespread truncation of star formation observed in cluster galaxies. Quilis, Moore\nand Bower (2000) use a finite difference code to achieve higher resolution in order to be\nable to include complex turbulent and viscous stripping at the interface of cold and hot\ngaseous components as well as the formation of bow shocks in the ICM ahead of the galaxy.\nFrom only a few selected runs on galaxies with holes in the central gas distribution they\nreverse the conclusion of Abadi et al. (1999) and state that ICM - ISM interaction could\nexplain the morphology of S0 galaxies and the rapid truncation of star formation implied by\nspectroscopic observations. The main difference with the Abadi et al. result is the use of a\ncomplex multi phase structure of the ISM. They show that the presence of holes and bubbles\nin the diffuse H I can greatly enhance the stripping efficiency. As the ICM streams through\nthe holes in the ISM it ablates the edges and prevents stripped gas from falling back. Schulz\nand Struck (2001) in a comprehensive study using SPH, an adaptive mesh HYDRA code,\nand including radiative cooling, confirm that low column density gas is promptly removed\n\n\fJ. H. van Gorkom\nfrom the disk. They also find that the onset of the ICM wind has a profound effect on the gas\nin the disk, that does not get stripped. The remnant disk is compressed and slightly displaced\nrelative to the halo center. This can trigger gravitational instability, angular momentum gets\ntransported outward and the disk compresses further forming a ring. This makes the inner\ndisk resistant to further stripping, but presumably susceptible to global starbursts. These\nvarious simulations appear to more or less agree on the effects of the ISM. All of the above\nwork modelled the ICM as a constant wind. Vollmer et al. (2001) took a different approach.\nUsing an N-body/sticky-particle code they simulate galaxies in radial orbits through the\ngravitational potential of the Virgo cluster. The galaxies thus experience a time variable\nram pressure and maximal damage to their gaseous disks only becomes apparent well after\nclosest approach to the Virgo Cluster center. Thus if we see galaxies with truncated H I disks\nor distorted velocity fields they are likely to be on their way out from the center. They also\nfind that a considerable part of the stripped total gas mass remains bound to the galaxy and\nfalls back onto the galactic disk after the stripping event, possibly causing a central starburst.\nThe results of Schulz and Struck (2001) and Vollmer et al (2001) are the first to produce\nsimultaneously stripping in the outer parts and a mechanism to enhance star formation in\nthe inner parts. This may help use up any remaining gas in the central regions and it could\npossibly do some secular bulge building. There is observational evidence for stripped H I\ndisks with enhanced central H I surface densities (Cayatte et al. 1994) and there are several\nlines of evidence that the most recent episode of star formation in cluster galaxies occurred\nin the central parts (e.g. Rose et al. 2001)\n\n1.4\n\nComparison of Simulations with H I Imaging\n\nThe wealth of single dish data on the H I content of selected spirals in the cluster environment, has shown beyond doubt that H I deficiency occurs among cluster spirals.\nThese data are less suitable to study the mechanisms that remove the gas. Projection effects\nalong the line of sight and uncertainties about the orbital history of individual galaxies complicate matters. H I imaging has so far provided far less statistics, but in the imaging data\nindividual galaxies can be selected that appear to have distortions in their H I morphology\nor kinematics that are unique to the cluster environment. A prime example is the occurrence\nof tiny H I disks in Virgo (Cayatte et al. 1990; Warmels 1988a,b). The size of the gaseous\ndisks is considerably smaller than the optical disk, the effect is most pronounced close to\nthe cluster center and gently decreases at increasing distance from the center. In addition\nto Virgo this has now also been seen in the Coma cluster (Bravo-Alfaro et al. 2000, 2001).\nFigure 3 shows an overlay of the total H I emission (contours) on an DSS optical image in\ngreyscale. Each galaxy is located at its proper position in Coma, but the images are blown\nup by a factor 7. The thick contours are the X-ray emission as observed with ROSAT. The\nfirst thing to note is that the H I disks seen in projection on the X-ray emission are in general\nsmaller compared to the optical image than for galaxies far from the center of Coma. An\nexample in case is the galaxy CGCG 160-095 (NGC 4921) east of the center where H I is\nonly seen in one half of the disk. This must be caused by a mechanism that only affects the\ngas and ram pressure stripping is a good candidate. Figure 4 shows the H I deficiency versus\nprojected distance from the center. Its interpretation is already more complicated. Though\nnone of the galaxies projected on to the X-ray emission has a normal H I content (deficiency\n0.0), there are several non detections out to large projected radii. Possibly these galaxies\nhave already gone through the center.\n\n\fJ. H. van Gorkom\n\nFig. 1.3. Composite of individual H I images of Coma spirals observed with the\nVLA. Galaxies are shown at their proper position and they are magnified by a\nfactor 7. The H I images (contours) are overlaid on DSS optical images (greyscale).\nThe large scale contours sketch the X-ray emission as observed by Vikhlinin et al.\n(1997). From Bravo-Alfaro et al. 2000.\n\nImaging of Virgo and Coma indicates that H I disks that are smaller than the optical ones\nmay be generic to cluster galaxies. Numerical simulations show that this is what you expect\nfrom ram pressure stripping. Abadi et al. (1999) show the results of a simulation with a\nconstant ram pressure typical of the Virgo Cluster ICM and galaxies moving with relative\nvelocities of 1000 km/s for galaxies of different size. The dependence of stripping radius\non disk scale length (plotted in their Figure 3) is consistent with the result found by Cayatte\net al. (1994). Even more impressive is the result of Vollmer et al. (2001) shown in Figure\n5. The simulation specifically models galaxies on radial orbits through the Virgo potential.\nThe figure plots H I deficiency versus H I to optical diameter. Both the model data (stars)\nand observed values (Cayatte et al. 1994) are shown. The solid line corresponds to a model\nwhere only the outer parts of the disk get stripped and the constant central H I radial surface\ndensity remains unchanged in the stripping process.\nVollmer in a series of papers (Vollmer 2003; Vollmer et al. 2001b; Vollmer et al. 2000;\nVollmer et al. 1999) tries to reproduce observed gas distribution and kinematics of selected\nVirgo spirals with his N-body/sticky particle simulations. The galaxies are selected based\n\n\fJ. H. van Gorkom\n\nFig. 1.4. Distribution of H I deficiency parameter as a function of the projected\ndistance from the center of Coma.

In several cases\nthe simulations can reproduce the observed signatures in the gas and all of these galaxies are\n\n\fJ. H. van Gorkom\n\nFig. 1.6.

The\nimage indicates the locations of the giant ellipticals M87, M86 and M49, which are\nassociated with sub-clusters. From Kenney et al. 2003.\n\nfound to be on their way out of the cluster having passed through the dense center. In one\ncase (NGC 4654) Vollmer (2003) shows that both ram pressure stripping and a gravitational\ninteraction must be at play.\nOne of the most interesting things that has been found recently is a number of galaxies\nwith truncated H I disks, normal or enhanced star formation in the central regions, and some\nextraplanar gas on one side of the galaxy, while the stellar disks are completely undisturbed.\nThese may be the best candidates for galaxies, that are currently undergoing an ICM-ISM\ninteraction. A prime example is NGC 4522, studied by Kenney and collaborators in great\ndetail. Kenney and Koopmann (1999) first pointed out that NGC 4522 is one of the best\ncandidates for ICM-ISM stripping in action. Figures 6, 7 and 8 summarize the main characteristics of this galaxy. NGC 4522 is located within a subclump of the Virgo cluster centered\non M49. A ROSAT map (Figure 6) shows weak extended X ray emission at the projected\nlocation of NGC 4522. All the known peculiarities of NGC 4522 are associated with gas,\ndust and H II regions, not with the older stars. The H I (Figure 7) is spatially coincident with\nthe undisturbed stellar disk in the central 3 kpc (0.4 R25 ) of the galaxy. At 0.4 R25 the H I\ntruncates abruptly and is only seen above the plane to the SW. About half of the total the H I\n\n\fJ. H. van Gorkom\n\nFig. 1.7. H I contours overlaid on an R band greyscale image from the WIYN\ntelescope from Kenney & Koopmann (1999). Note the undisturbed outer disk.\nFrom Kenney et al. 2003.\n\nappears to be extraplanar extending to \u2248 3 kpc above the plane (Kenney et al. 2003). There\nis striking similarity between the spatial distribution of the H\u03b1 emission and the H I emission (Figure 8). The H\u03b1 emission from the disk is confined to the inner 3 kpc as well and\nextraplanar H\u03b1 filaments (10% of the H\u03b1 emission) emerge from the outer edge of the H\u03b1\ndisk (Kenney and Koopmann 1999). Note that there are H II regions associated with each\nof the 2 major extraplanar H I peaks, and that those in the SW are much more luminous.\nThese data strongly suggest an ICM-ISM interaction. The undisturbed stellar disk rules out\na gravitational interaction. The truncated H I disk suggests ram pressure stripping is at work.\nThe extraplanar gas has almost certainly been swept out of the disk. A detailed simulation\nby Vollmer et al. 2000 suggests that the gas is falling back after a stripping event, but this is\ninconsistent with the observed kinematics (Kenney et al. 2003). More likely the gas is still\non its way out due to ram pressure stripping (Kenney and Koopmann 1999). The combined\ncharacteristics such as a stripped H I disk, only central H\u03b1 emission in the disk, extraplanar\ngas on only one side of the galaxy make this such a convincing candidate for an ICM-ISM\ninteraction. Evidence for enhanced central star formation in some other examples like this\nmakes this the more interesting. A central starburst would help use up any remaining gas\nand a morphological transformation would be in place.\n\n\fJ. H. van Gorkom\n\nFig. 1.8. H I contours overlaid on an H\u03b1 greyscale image from Kenney and Koopmann (1999). Note that there are H II regions associated with each of the 2 major\nextraplanar H I peaks. From Kenney et al. 2003.\n\n1.5\n\nSurveys and the Importance of Interactions with the ICM\n\nSo far I have only presented evidence that interaction with the ICM occurs based\non selected cases. The small gaseous disks in the optically selected samples of Virgo and\nComa are almost certain due to rampressure stripping. A growing number of spiral galaxies is found with an unusual morphology in HI, H\u03b1, and radio continuum, e.g. the long\nknown examples in A1367 (Gavazzi et al. 1995), in Virgo galaxies such as NGC 4522,\nNGC 4388 (Veilleux et al. 1999), NGC 4569 and NGC 4438 (Vollmer, in prep) and in Coma\n(Bravo-Alfaro et al. 2001, Gregg 2003, Beijersbergen 2003). These are prime candidates\nfor ongoing ram pressure stripping.\nHow important are these ICM-ISM interactions for the evolution of galaxies in clusters?\nAn important first step to address this question is the imaging study by Koopmann and\nKenney (1998, 2002) of 55 Virgo Cluster spirals in H\u03b1 and R band. They find that the\ntotal massive star formation rates in Virgo Cluster spirals have been reduced by factors up\nto 2.5 in the median compared to isolated spirals. The reduction in total star formation is\ncaused primarily by truncation of the star-forming disks (seen in 52% of the spirals). Some\nof these have undisturbed stellar disks and are likely the product of ICM-ISM stripping,\nbut others have disturbed stellar disks, and are likely the product of tidal interactions or\nminor mergers, possibly in addition to ICM-ISM stripping. Some evidence is found for\nenhanced star formation rates due to low velocity tidal interactions and possibly accretion of\nH I gas. A strong correlation is found between H I deficiency and normalized H\u03b1 flux. The\n\n\fJ.

Note the very non gaussian distribution of the\nvelocities. In Figure 11 an example is shown of spatial and velocity clustering of\nH I detected galaxies.\n\nauthors conclude that the survey provides strong evidence that ICM-ISM interactions play a\nsignificant role in the evolution of most Virgo spirals by stripping gas from their outer disks.\nSo far I have only discussed H I results obtained on individual galaxies that were selected\nbecause they were interesting or, at best, because they were in some optical flux limited sample. To see how the gas content and morphology depends on cluster environment optically\nunbiased studies need to be done. Ideally one should probe the entire volume of clusters,\nincluding the low density outskirts, to get some idea of the gas content and star formation\nproperties as function of local or global density.\nThe first volume limited H I survey of a cluster was done of the Hydra cluster (McMahon 1993; van Gorkom 1996). Dickey (1997) surveyed two clusters in the rich group of\nclusters in the Hercules cluster. These surveys already show that there is a great variety in\nthe neutral hydrogen properties of clusters. Hydra shows barely any evidence for hydrogen\ndeficiency, despite the fact that it is very similar in its global properties to the Virgo Cluster.\nThe most likely explanation of these results is that Hydra is in fact a superposition of at\nleast three groups along the line of sight, seen in projection close to each other. The most\nstriking result of the Hercules survey (Dickey 1997) is the spatial variation of H I properties\n\n\fJ.

All galaxies with an H I mass \u2265 2 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 in the\nvelocity range of the cluster are shown.\n\nwithin the clusters. Galaxies in the A2147 and the southwest of A2151 show strong H I\ndeficiency, while galaxies in the northeast of A2151 are gas rich. It is perhaps one of the\nmost convincing demonstrations of environmental impact on galaxy properties. The X-ray\nluminous clusters have strong H I deficiency, the parts of the clusters that have no detectable\nICM have an abundance of gas rich galaxies.\nA more systematic survey of five nearby clusters (Abell 85, 754, 496, 2192, 2670) is\ncurrently being done at the VLA (van Gorkom et al. 2003; Poggianti and van Gorkom\n2001). Each cluster is completely covered out to 2 RA thus covering the dense inner parts\nand the low density outer parts and the entire optical velocity range is probed. The most\nstriking result is that in all clusters the H I detections are highly clustered both spatially and\nin velocity. Figure 9 shows the velocity distribution of the H I detections in three of the\nclusters. Although the velocity distibution of the optically catalogued galaxies in each of the\nclusters is gaussian, the velocity distribution of the gas rich galaxies is far from gaussian.\nFigure 10 shows the total H I image of Abell 2670. Contours represent the integrated H I\nemission for individual galaxies. At first glance the image looks like the images of the Virgo\nand Coma cluster with small H I disks close to the center and large H I disks further out.

Figure 11 shows an overlay of a group of galaxies to the NW on the DSS. The\ninternal velocity dispersion of this group is only a few 100 km/s. These galaxies are very\ngas rich and obviously conditions for interactions and merging are ideal. Several galaxies\ndo in fact show evidence for distorted H I. These results indicate that gas rich disk galaxies\nthat make it into the center of a cluster are likely to be seriously affected by interaction with\nte ICM. It is likely that a significant fraction of disk galaxies, falling into clusters, is located\nin low velocity dispersion loose groups. The interactions in these groups, before the actual\n\n\fJ. H. van Gorkom\ninfall, may be more damaging to the morphology than any ICM interaction thereafter. The\nmost dramatic example (Figure 12) of that is the H I image of a number of S0 galaxies in\nthe outskirts of the Ursa Major cluster by Verheijen and Zwaan (2001). Optically one would\nnot have guessed that anything dramatic is about to happen to these galaxies. The H I shows\nthat strong interactions are already taking place.\n\n1.6\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nWe can now begin to answer the question posed in the introduction: are interactions\nwith the ICM important for the evolution of disk galaxies. The answer is a definite yes for\ndisk galaxies in cluster environments. We see individual galaxies that show all the signs of\nan ongoing interaction, signs that are predicted by detailed hydrodynamical simulations. We\nsee trends in galaxy properties, such as the truncated gaseous disks in the center of Virgo\nand Coma, and truncated starformation disks in Virgo (Koopmann and Kenney 2002) that\ncan be reproduced in simulations of ICM interactions with the cold ISM in disk galaxies.\nThese interactions should produce a population of early type non star-forming disk galaxies\nwith a range of bulge to disk ratios, as was predicted by Dressler and Gunn (1983) and as has\nbeen found in Virgo (Koopmann and Kenney 2002). However other effects play a role too\nin clusters. Galaxies are found that experience both stripping and gravitational interactions\n(Koopmann and Kenney 2002; Vollmer 2003) and examples of gravitationally induced star\nformation have also been found (Koopmann and Kenney 2002; Rose et al. 2001; Sakai et al.\n2002). However the dominant environmental effect on cluster disk galaxies is a reduction\nof the star formation rate, which goes hand in hand with hydrogen deficiency, and for most\ngalaxies this is due to ram pressure stripping (Koopmann and Kenney 2002).\nOn larger scales Solanes et al 2001 found evidence that the H I deficiency goes out as\nfar as 2 RA . Although this is surprisingly far, the fact that the deficient galaxies at large\ndistances from the cluster tend to be on radial orbits, makes it plausible that the cause of the\ndeficiency is ram pressure stripping as well. The extent of the H I deficiency fits in nicely\nwith the results of Balogh et al. (1998), who find that the star formation rate as measured\nby the [O II] equivalent width is depressed in clusters out to two R200 (\u2248 2 RA ) and more\nrecently the analyses of the 2dF and the SDSS survey results (Lewis et al. 2002; Gomez\net al. 2003; Nichol, this conference), which indicate that star formation rates begin to drop\nbetween one and two virial radii. These results are somewhat at odds with the H I imaging\nresults where evidence is found that the groups in the outskirts of clusters are very gas rich.\nMany examples of ongoing interactions are found in these locations. In a simple scenario\nthe interactions would bring gas to large distances from the galaxies, which could then easily\nbe stripped as the galaxies fall into the denser ICM.\nIt is an intriguing possibility that the impact and reach of the ICM is closely related to the\ndynamical state of the cluster. Cluster-(sub)cluster merging can give rise to bulk motions,\nshocks and temperature structure within the ICM. In merging clusters observational evidence\nhas been found for large velocities in the ICM (Dupke and Bregman 2001), enhanced star\nformation (Miller and Owen 2003; Miller, this conference) and distortion of radio sources\nby the ICM motions (Bliton et al 1998). If stripping would mostly depend on the motions of\nthe ICM and the dynamical state of the cluster, it would more easily explain why the effects\nare seen far out into the infall region. The radial orbits measured for the more distant H I\ndeficient galaxies would then reflect the infall direction of the most recent accretion event in\nthe cluster.\n\n\fJ.
