These tests include a wide range of direct particle searches\nas well as high-precision tests of quantum effects. Since the Standard Model, including the\nyet to be observed Higgs boson, is based on a renormalizable gauge field theory, the model\ncan also be consistently extrapolated to energies many orders of magnitude above what we\nhave probed directly.\nDespite these successes, the central ingredient of electroweak symmetry breaking is not\nfully understood - we still have not yet discovered the Higgs boson responsible for the\nbreakdown of the electroweak SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y symmetry to its smaller electromagnetic\nU (1)em subgroup within the Standard Model. The search for the source of electroweak\nsymmetry breaking has been the major motivation for experimental searches as well as\ntheoretical model building for the past 25 years.\nBeyond our ignorance of the cause of electroweak symmetry breaking, there are many\nreasons to hope and expect that new particles and interactions beyond the Standard Model\nwill be discovered in the near future. These include:\n1. A fundamental scalar Higgs boson is not the only way to induce electroweak symmetry\nbreaking. New strong interactions can also play this role. All we know to date is that\na light Higgs boson is consistent with precision electroweak data, but this does not\ngenerally preclude other possibilities.\n2. If the Higgs boson is a fundamental scalar, its mass parameter - which is closely tied\nto the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking - is extremely sensitive to quantum\ncorrections. As a result, attempts to extrapolate the Standard Model to energies much\nabove the electroweak scale lead to the gauge hierarchy problem, where an extreme finetuning of the underlying model parameters is required to maintain the electroweak\nscale at its observed value. This is not inconsistent theoretically, but it is at the very\nleast extremely puzzling.\n3. The Standard Model is unable to account for the dark matter in the universe. On the\nother hand, dark matter can be explained by a new stable weak-scale particle with\nweak couplings. Such a state can naturally obtain the correct relic density to make up\nthe dark matter through the process of thermal freeze-out in the early universe. Stable\nnew weakly-interacting states also arise in many theories that attempt to protect the\nscale of electroweak symmetry breaking.\n4. The Standard Model cannot explain the asymmetry of visible matter over antimatter. New physics near the electroweak scale can potentially give rise to this baryon\nasymmetry.\nThis is only a partial list of shortcomings of the Standard Model. Other challenges include\nthe three almost unifying gauge couplings, a quantum description of gravity, an explanation\nfor the cosmological constant, and an understanding of the sources of flavor mixing and the\nmasses of neutrinos. The items on our list, however, seem the most likely to be solved by\nnew physics near the electroweak scale.\n4\n\n\fMany theories have been proposed for new physics beyond the Standard Model that\naddress one or more of the challenges on our list. Based on current data, it is not clear\nwhich of them, if any, are correct. However, this is about to change. With the recent start\nof the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and a wide range of other collider experiments and\ncosmological probes already underway or about to begin, in the next few years we may\nfinally be able to uncover the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking and new physics\nrelated to it.\nIn this work we review some of the most popular proposals for new physics beyond the\nStandard Model and we describe how they might be discovered at the LHC. Our goal is to\npresent a broad overview of both models and collider signatures, which we hope will be useful\nto theorists and experimentalists alike. There is no true target audience for this review, and\nmany readers might find those parts dealing with their area of expertise rather short and\nsomewhat incomplete. At the same time, we hope that only very few people would say that\nabout this entire volume. Certainly the three authors do not feel that way \u2013 all of us are\nstill trying to learn all the physics which are included in our own work.\nThe outline of this review is as follows. In the remainder of this section we discuss in\nmore detail the motivation for physics beyond the Standard Model. The main body of the\nreview has two orthogonal organization principles. First, in Section II we review some of the\nmany proposals for this new physics, including supersymmetry, extra dimensions, and strong\ninteractions. The focus in this section will be on the structures of TeV-scale models and\ntheir generic features at colliders. Secondly, in Section III we collect and describe collider\nsignals these and other models predict. In addition, some of the signals will not actually\nbe linked to a complete model, but are included because they pose interesting challenges to\nthe LHC experiments. Finally, in Section IV we describe how these signals can be mapped\nback to identify and extract information about particular models, reflecting our hopes for\nhow the physics landscape will look towards the end of the LHC era.\nThe matrix structure linking new physics models and new physics signatures at the LHC\nwe also illustrate in the following table. Single check marks indicate possible and established\nlinks, double check marks mean generic signatures whose observation would be taken as a\nstrong hint concerning underlying models.\nOf course, the enormous number of existing models and analyses, as well as our limitations of space and time, make it impossible to be truly complete.

There are\nseveral reasons for this: first, the field of physics searches at the LHC itself is so wide that it\nwould be impossible to cover it in any kind of satisfactory manner in less that 1000 pages.\nWriting a text book on physics searches at the LHC, on the other hand, will most likely\nhave to wait until we know what kind of new physics we will have discovered. Following\nthe comments from the introduction it is clearly debatable if we really have an interest in\ndocumenting all wrong TeV-scale model building directions taken in the run up to LHC.\nEven worse, physics searches at the LHC extensively build on other fields of physics,\nlike QCD for the description of the incoming (and outgoing) particles, particle physics and\nkinematics to interpret our measurements, electroweak symmetry breaking to judge their\nrelevance, and astrophysics to see if some of our greatest hopes on unifying particle physics\nand cosmology have really come true.\nIn a first step, we can recommend a few standard text books which we find useful to\nadvanced students with some knowledge of field theory and particle physics. Focussing on\nQCD there are a few text books we can recommend: the classical work for LHC physics is\nthe book by Keith Ellis, James Stirling and Bryan Webber [1], in particular the chapters\nbased on hadron collider physics. A very useful addition is the monograph by G\u00fcnther\nDissertori, Ian Knowles and Michael Schmelling [2]. Finally, for more technical questions\nconcerning next-to-leading order calculations for the LHC Rick Field's book has been of\ngreat use to us [3]. For a little broader scope on the entire Standard Model of particle\nphysics and less focus on QCD we can recommend the work by Otto Nachtmann [4] or the\nhands-on introduction to all of collider physics by Vernon Barger, Roger Phillips, and Tao\nHan [5]. Slightly deviating from the main topic of LHC physics Wolfgang Kilian's notes on\nelectroweak symmetry breaking offer precisely the perspective we will adopt when discussing\nstrongly interacting physics models [6].\nUnfortunately, even starting from those text books it is not unlikely that there will still\nbe a small gap to bridge before really enjoying our condensed review article, written from the\nclear perspective of LHC new physics searchers. Luckily, there exists an invaluable source\nof reviews targeted at the level of slightly advanced graduate students: the lecture notes\ntriggered by the TASI school series in Boulder, Colorado. For those of us who have been\ninvolved the perseverance with which these notes are collected might at times have appeared\nas a big pain. On the other hand, it leaves us with an excellent series of pedagogical writeups\nfor example on collider physics [7], QCD [8, 9], Higgs physics [9, 10], electroweak precision\ndata [11], dark matter [12], supersymmetry [13], extra dimensions [14], or random topics\nof our interest [15]. When historians of science will at some time in the future look back\nat our era of unlimited creativity at the TeV scale, which was so abruptly ended by LHC\nobservations, this collection of notes will serve as proof in the most painful detail.\nA.\n\nElectroweak symmetry breaking\n\nElectroweak symmetry breaking lies at the core of the Standard Model [16\u201318]. The\nstructure of the Standard Model is built around the gauge group SU (3)c \u00d7 SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y .\nOf this, only the smaller SU (3)c \u00d7 U (1)em subgroup is manifest at low energies. Electroweak\nsymmetry breaking is the process of reducing SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y to U (1)em . It gives rise to\n7\n\n\fthe underlying masses of the Standard Model fermions and is the reason why the weak\ninteractions appear to be so much weaker than electromagnetism. In the Standard Model,\nelectroweak symmetry breaking is induced by the scalar Higgs field, and the associated Higgs\nboson excitation is the only particle in the model that has not yet been discovered [19].\nA wide range of precision electroweak measurements have given us confidence that the\nunderlying gauge structure of the Standard Model is correct. However, until we discover\nthe Higgs boson (or convince ourselves that it does not exist), we will not fully understand\nelectroweak symmetry breaking.\nThe Higgs field H = (H + , H 0 )t is the only fundamental scalar in the Standard Model, and\ntransforms as (1, 2, 1/2) under SU (3)c \u00d7 SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y [9, 10, 20, 21]. Gauge invariance\nand renormalizability allow the Higgs potential\n\u03bb\nVHiggs = m2H |H|2 + |H|4 .\n2\n\n(1)\n\nIf m2H is negative, the minimum of the potential defining the vacuum of the theory can be\ntaken to be\nr\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u2212m2H\n0\nhHi =\nwith\nv=\n.\n(2)\nv\n\u03bb\nSince the Higgs field transforms non-trivially under SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y , this vacuum spontaneously 'breaks' this gauge symmetry to the smaller U (1)em subgroup with charges\nQ = (t3L + Y ) under which the vacuum is neutral.\nExpanding about this vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the Higgs field, there is a\nphysical Higgs boson scalar h0 with mass [10, 21]\n\u221a\nmh = 2\u03bb v.\n(3)\nThe Higgs VEV also allows the SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y gauge bosons to mix yielding a massless\nphoton \u03b3 corresponding to the unbroken U (1)em gauge group, along with massive W \u00b1 and\nZ 0 vector bosons with tree-level masses\nm2W =\n\ng2 2\nv ,\n2\n\nm2Z =\n\ng 2 + g 02 2\nv ,\n2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere g and g 0 are the SU (2)L and U (1)Y gauge couplings. Electroweak measurements fix\nthe vacuum expectation value of the Higgs to be v ' 174 GeV. Counting degrees of freedom,\nthree of the four real components of H have gone to generate the longitudinal components\nof the W \u00b1 and Z 0 gauge bosons, while the fourth component shows up as the physical Higgs\nboson h0 .\nA wide range collider and low-energy measurements have tested the electroweak structure\nof the Standard Model to an extremely high level of precision. They also provide indirect\ninformation about the Higgs [11, 22]. Indeed, these probes are so precise that it is necessary\nto include quantum corrections when making theoretical predictions for the Standard Model.\nOnce such corrections are incorporated, the Standard Model provides a good fit to the data\ngiving us confidence that we are on the right track [23].\nHowever, among the quantum corrections that must be included are loop diagrams involving the Higgs. These corrections depend logarithmically on the Higgs mass, and an agreement between the Standard Model and data requires that the Higgs not be too much heavier\n8\n\n\f6\n\nmLimit = 157 GeV\n\nAugust 2009\n\nTheory uncertainty\n\u2206\u03b1had =\n(5)\n\n5\n\n0.02758\u00b10.00035\n0.02749\u00b10.00012\nincl. low Q2 data\n\n\u2206\u03c72\n\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\nExcluded\n30\n\nPreliminary\n\n100\n\n300\n\nmH [GeV]\n\nFIG. 1: Limits on the Higgs mass within the Standard Model from precision electroweak constraints, and direct Higgs searches by the LEP and Tevatron experiments.

Note that all of these experimental result are very sensitive to the underlying\nmodel, which means that they only hold for the Standard Model with its minimal Higgs\nsector. Extended models could, for example, prefer a heavy Higgs boson based on the same\ndata. Both the Tevatron and the LHC are expected to probe the remaining electroweakcompatible range of Standard Model Higgs masses in the coming years.\nDespite these successes, the fundamental scalar SM Higgs field also presents a severe\ntheoretical puzzle that we will discuss in the next section. In light of this, it worth looking\nat what would happen if the Standard Model did not contain a Higgs. To be more precise,\nconsider a theory with the same particle content and interactions as the Standard Model,\nbut with massive W \u00b1 and Z 0 vector bosons and no Higgs. This theory is not renormalizable,\nbut it can be understood as an effective theory with a high-energy cutoff. Computing the\namplitude for W W \u2192 W W scattering at tree-level, we obtain [27, 28]\n\u0012\n\u0013\ns\ns\n(2)\n(00 )\nAW W = A (cos \u03b8) 2 + A (cos \u03b8) ln\n+ A(0) (cos \u03b8),\n(6)\nmW\nm2W\n\u221a\nwhere s is the center-of-mass energy and cos \u03b8 is the scattering angle. We can always\ndecompose this amplitude into partial waves according to\nA = 16\u03c0\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(2` + 1) P` (cos \u03b8) a` .\n\n`=0\n\n9\n\n(7)\n\n\fPerturbative unitarity of the scattering process requires that |a` | \u2264 1/2 for all `. Comparing\nto Eq. (6), we see that this condition is violated by the tree-level\u221aamplitude\u221afor s \u001d m2W .\nCareful analyses [27, 28] find that this breakdown occurs for s = (4\u03c0 2/GF )1/2 '\n1.2 TeV \u223c 2\u03c0 v.\nAt this point let us emphasize strongly that quantum mechanical unitarity is not violated\n- even without a Higgs the underlying quantum field theory is manifestly unitary. What\nhappens\nis that the tree-level amplitude given in Eq. (6) does not give the whole story. For\n\u221a\ns \u001d mW , higher-order corrections are expected to become large and correct the amplitude\nto maintain unitarity. This implies that the electroweak theory without a Higgs becomes\nstrongly coupled at energies on the order of 1 TeV. It is not known precisely how the theory\nwith massive vector bosons behaves at higher energies, but deviations from the Standard\nModel (with a Higgs) are expected to be large enough to be visible at the LHC [29\u201331].\n0\nPutting the Higgs back in, the dangerous A(2) and A(0 ) terms in Eq. (6) are cancelled by\ntree-level diagrams involving the Higgs [32\u201335]. As long as the mass of the Higgs boson\nis less than mh . 1 TeV, W W scattering remains weakly-coupled to up arbitrarily high\nenergies.\nIn the coming years the Tevatron and the LHC will probe the interesting range of masses\nfor a Higgs boson within the Standard Model. If there is new physics beyond the Standard\nModel allowing the Higgs to be heavier or not present at all, these colliders also stand an\nexcellent chance of discovering it. Given the success of the Standard Model with a Higgs\nboson, both in terms of precision electroweak constraints and calculability of scattering\namplitudes, our primary focus is on scenarios with a fundamental Higgs boson throughout\nmuch of this review.\nB.\n\nGauge hierarchy problem\n\nThe Higgs is a fundamental scalar field in the Standard Model, and this fact leads to a\nsevere theoretical puzzle. Electroweak symmetry breaking is induced by the Higgs at the\nenergy scale v ' 174 GeV. In contrast, the characteristic energy scale of gravity appears\nto be the much larger Planck mass, MPl ' 2.4 \u00d7 1018 GeV. This enormous difference of\nenergy scales is unstable against quantum corrections or loop correction, and it is a mystery\nwhy the electroweak scale is not much closer to MPl [36\u201338]. Attempts to solve this gauge\nhierarchy problem require new physics beyond the Standard Model near the electroweak\nscale. Discovering this new physics is a major motivation for the LHC.\nTo see where the problem arises, suppose we try to extrapolate the Standard Model up to\nmuch higher energies near the Planck scale, assuming there is no new physics along the way.\nSince the Standard Model is renormalizable and weakly-coupled this is a sensible thing to\ndo, at least up to near the Planck scale, where we expect that gravitational interactions will\nbecome relevant. Approaching the Planck scale, gravitational interactions might become\nrelevant, and we will have to expand our description of elementary particles to include\ngravity. Unfortunately, we have no clear guiding principle to decide how to write down an\nultraviolet completion to gravity, as we will discuss in Section II B 1. But until then, it\nshould be clear sailing.\nThe problem with such an extrapolation is that quantum loop effects generate large\ncorrections to the Higgs mass parameter m2H . The most dangerous correction comes from\n10\n\n\ft\nH\n\nH\n\nFIG. 2: Correction to m2H in the Standard Model from the top quark. Similar contributions arise\nfrom the weak gauge boson and from the Higgs boson itself.\n\nthe top quark loop shown in Fig. 2, and is quadratically divergent in the ultraviolet (UV).\nCutting it off at scale \u039b, the leading correction to the Higgs mass parameter is [39]\n\u2206m2H = \u2212\n\n3yt2 2\n\u039b.\n(4\u03c0)2\n\n(8)\n\nWe see that for \u039b \u001d v, the correction to m2H from the top loop is much larger than v 2 . Since\nthe electroweak scale v is determined by m2H through Eq. (2), maintaining v \u001c \u039b/4\u03c0 would\nseem to require a severe fine-tuning of the underlying parameters of the theory.\nIn writing Eq. (8) we have implicitly treated the UV-regulated loop diagram as a physical\ncorrection. A reader experienced in quantum field might object to this since upon renormalizing the theory the dependence on \u039b disappears, and the remainder is an acceptably\nsmall finite correction proportional to the top quark mass. This renormalization procedure,\nhowever, is simply the act of parameterizing the unknown UV physics in terms of a finite\nnumber of model parameters. One candidate for the correct UV theory (and a quantum\ntheory of gravity) is superstring theory [40]. Within string theory, the would-be divergences\nare regulated by the appearance of stringy states whose masses begin at a scale MS that\nis usually close to MPl . From this point of view, we should take the UV cutoff as a physical quantity with \u039b \u223c MS , and the act of renormalizing away the top quark quadratic\ndivergence is completely equivalent to a fine-tuning of the underlying parameters. A similar\nconclusion holds in other UV completions with a very large characteristic energy scale.\nIndependent of the details of renormalization and the correct UV completion of the\nStandard Model, there are also large finite corrections to the Higgs mass from any heavy\nnew particles that couple to the Standard Model. For example, a new fermion with mass\nmf and Higgs Yukawa coupling yf produces a finite one-loop threshold correction on the\norder of [39]\nyf2\n2\n\u2206mH \u223c \u2212\nm2 .\n(9)\n(4\u03c0)2 f\nCorrections of this form arise in a number of models of new physics such as heavy righthanded neutrinos, or new states associated with gauge unification or quantum gravity. Even\nif the new states do not couple directly to the Higgs, they can still contribute dangerously\nto m2H at higher loop order.\nSolutions to the gauge hierarchy problem almost always involve new particles with masses\nbelow 4\u03c0 v \u223c TeV. These solutions fall into three general classes. In the first class, new\npartner particles in the theory cancel off the dangerous corrections to m2H from quadratically\ndivergent loops of Standard Model particles. Examples include supersymmetry [39] where\nloops of superpartners cancel against loops of Standard Model states, and little Higgs theories [41] in which new same-spin partners cancel against their Standard Model counterparts.\n11\n\n\fFIG. 3: Regions in the plane of the energy density of the Universe in the form of dark matter (xaxis) and dark energy (y-axis) expressed as a fraction of the critical density, which are consistent\nwith observations of the CMB, supernova, and structure formation. From Ref. [47].\n\nThe second class of solutions involves lowering the fundamental ultraviolet cutoff of the\ntheory to near the electroweak scale. Examples in this class typically have additional spacetime dimensions that effectively reduce the underlying scale of gravity to near the electroweak\nscale [14].\nIn the third class, the Higgs boson is either removed altogether or emerges as a composite\nbound state of fermions. Examples include technicolor and composite Higgs models [42].\nThe really exciting part about all these solutions to the hierarchy problem is that they lead\nto new signals at the LHC.\nC.\n\nDark matter\n\nThere is overwhelming evidence that most of the matter in our Universe is composed\nof a non-relativistic particle species which interacts only very feebly with the Standard\nModel [43\u201346]. As can be seen in Figure 3, measurements of the cosmic microwave background, supernova luminosities versus distance, and structure formation all favor a Universe\nwith a large fraction of dark matter. The Standard Model does not contain a suitable candidate: its weakly-interacting particles are either too light (photons and neutrinos) or have\ntoo short lifetimes (as in the case of the Higgs or the Z) to be dark matter. The existence\nof dark matter therefore represents concrete experimental evidence for physics beyond the\nStandard Model.\nA new massive stable neutral particle can give rise to dark matter through the mechanism\nof thermal freeze out [48]. At the very high temperatures expected in the early universe, such\na state will reach thermodynamic equilibrium provided it has even very small interactions\nwith the Standard Model. As the universe cools below the particle mass, it becomes much\nmore probable for the stable particles to annihilate than to be created, and the equilibrium\n12\n\n\fparticle density starts to become exponentially small. The particle density eventually becomes so small that its annihilation effectively stops. The remaining relic stable particle\ndensity subsequently remains constant up to a dilution by the expansion of the Universe,\nand can make up the required dark matter density.\nThe relic particle energy density due to thermal freeze out is given approximately by [43]\n\u03a9DM h2 \u2261\n\n\u03c1DM 2 3 \u00d7 10\u221227 cm3 s\u22121\nh '\n,\n\u03c1tot\nh\u03c3vi\n\n(10)\n\nwhere h\u03c3vi is the thermal average of the annihilation cross section during freeze-out, and\nh = H0 /100 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ' 0.72 corresponds to the Hubble constant today. By comparison,\nthe measured value is \u03a9DM h2 = 0.1131 \u00b1 0.0034 [49]. In the case of a neutral particle with\na mass M annihilating to the Standard Model through a dimensionless coupling of strength\ng, the characteristic size of the annihilation cross-section is expected to be roughly\n\u0010 g \u00114 \u0012 500 GeV \u00132\ng4 1\n\u221226\n3 \u22121\nh\u03c3vi \u223c\n' (6 \u00d7 10 cm s )\n(11)\n16\u03c0 M 2\n0.5\nM\nFrom Eqs. (10) and (11) we see that one obtains the correct DM density if the new stable\nparticle has mass M \u223c 500 GeV and a coupling to the Standard Model g \u223c 0.5.\nIn light of the discussion in the previous subsections, this result is highly suggestive.\nBecause the hierarchy problem is intrinsically a question about the electroweak interaction, solutions to it naturally contain weakly-interacting massive particles (WIMPs) \u2013 new\nparticles with electroweak couplings (g \u223c 0.5) and masses close to the electroweak scale\n(v = 174 GeV). These two features are precisely what is needed to generate the observed\ndark matter density, provided one of the new states is stable. This seeming coincidence\nis often called the \"WIMP miracle\", and has guided most of the past theoretical work on\nthermal relics [43\u201346, 50]\nWhile a thermal WIMP as dark matter makes for a compelling picture, it could also\nsimply be a coincidence of scales [51]. Our estimation of the WIMP relic density relies on\nextrapolating the thermal history of the Universe backwards from the time of nucleosynthesis\nto temperatures of order 10-100 GeV. The history of the Universe could well deviate from\nour extrapolation if there are unexpected light degrees of freedom, or if there was an injection\nof entropy after freeze-out from a phase transition or the decay of a heavy particle no longer\nin thermodynamic equilibrium[52]. Alternatively, the production of WIMPs in the early\nUniverse can arise in a natural way from a number of non-thermal mechanisms, such as\nthe late decay of a heavy state into dark matter [53], or from a connection to a primordial\ncharge asymmetry between particles and anti-particles [54] (such as the asymmetry between\nbaryons and anti-baryons(. There are also many plausible candidates for dark matter that\naren't WIMPs at all such as the Peccei-Quinn axion [55], or super-heavy relics [56].\nThe subtle component in a theory of dark matter is explaining why the dark matter\nparticle is massive, but (at least to a very good approximation) stable. In order for a state\nto have survived long enough to be the dark matter, it must have a lifetime longer than the\nage of the Universe itself. This is strongly suggestive of a symmetry, either exact or broken\nonly at very high (& MGUT \u223c 1016 GeV) scales. In fact, such a symmetry may also explain\nother features (not) seem in high energy data. The fact that no obvious deviations from\nthe SM predictions are present in precision electroweak observables [57] suggests that the\nscale of new physics should be larger than a few TeV, at odds with a natural solution to\n13\n\n\fthe hierarchy problem which should live at scales of a few hundred GeV. A simple way to\nreconcile these two scales (the so-called the \"Little Hierarchy Problem\") is to require that\nthe new physics only contribute to precision measurements at the loop level by inventing\na symmetry under which new states are odd and Standard Model states are even. This\nsymmetry may arise naturally from the structure of the theory, for example, as a remnant\nof higher-dimensional Lorentz invariance (KK-parity) as in models with Universal Extra\nDimensions [58] or as a technibaryon number in models of Technicolor [59]. Curing the\nlittle hierarchy problem by combatting large corrections to precision measurements it acts\nsimilarly as T -parity in Little Higgs Models [60]. Like R-parity in supersymmetric models\nor GUT models of warped extra dimensions [61] such a symmetry can also prevent proton\ndecay. In generally, it is important to remember that whatever the origin of such a protective\nsymmetry is, it may (if sufficiently exact) also serve to stabilize dark matter.\nGiven the strong potential for a deep connection between dark matter and electroweak\nsymmetry breaking, we will focus much of our discussion in this review on models that\naddress both in a unified framework. If the dark matter particle is related to electroweak\nsymmetry breaking, there is every reason to believe that it will be produced at the LHC. The\ncontrolled initial state and relatively well-understood backgrounds in LHC collisions make\nthis collider a powerful tool to extract information about the nature of dark matter from a\nwide range of measurements, as discussed in Section III B. This stands in contrast to other\nprograms to probe dark matter directly in the laboratory or indirectly from astrophysics,\nwhich usually include only few distinct measurements and are sensitive to uncertainties in\ndark matter distributions and astrophysical backgrounds. Even so, these techniques could\ninform us of the most promising search channels for dark matter at the LHC. In any case,\nLHC will provide an interesting and orthogonal take on dark matter, and has the potential to\ngreatly enhance our understanding of the results of searches for dark matter in the heavens.\nD.\n\nBaryon asymmetry\n\nA second major cosmological shortcoming of the Standard Model is that it is unable\nto explain the dominance of matter over antimatter. The only quantity in the Standard\nModel that distinguishes between matter and anti-matter is the CP-violating phase in the\nCabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, and it does not appear to be enough to explain\nthe observed asymmetry. On the other hand, many models of physics beyond the Standard\nModel contain new sources of CP violation, and in some cases these can be enough to\naccount for the matter asymmetry. The discovery of new physics at colliders and experiments\nsearching for CP violation may therefore provide clues to the cosmological matter mystery.\nReviews of baryogenesis can be found in Refs. [62].\nNearly all the non-exotic (i.e. non-dark) matter in the universe consists of baryons in the\nform of protons and neutrons. The net baryonic energy density extracted from measurements\nof the cosmic microwave background radiation is [49]\n\u03c1b /\u03c1tot = 0.0456 \u00b1 0.0015 .\n\n(12)\n\nThis value agrees with the nucleosynthesis estimates for light element abundances [63]. The\nnet density of antimatter in the universe is consistent with pair production in collisions of\nmatter accelerated by high-energy astrophysical processes.\n14\n\n\fBaryogenesis is the process of creating an excess of baryons over anti-baryons in the\nearly universe, starting from a Universe with equal numbers of both. Any mechanism of\nbaryogenesis must satisfy three Sakharov conditions [64]:\n1. violation of baryon number B;\n2. violation of C and CP;\n3. departure from thermodynamic equilibrium.\nThe need for B-violation and a departure from thermodynamic equilibrium are obvious,\nsince we want to go from a state with B = 0 to one with B 6= 0. C and CP violation are also\nnecessary because without them, a baryon-number violating process would produce just as\nmany baryons as anti-baryons on the average.\nAll three of these conditions are met by the Standard Model in the early universe. Departure from thermodynamic equilibrium can occur due to the expansion of spacetime, and we\nknow that C and CP violation are already present. Baryon number violation also occurs in\nthe Standard Model due to non-perturbative quantum effects. Both baryon (B) and lepton\n(L) number are symmetries of the Standard Model at the classical level, but the combination\n(B + L) is explicitly broken at the quantum level through nonperturbative SU (2)L interactions. The only processes in the Standard Model that actually violate (B + L) are tunnelling\ntransitions in the SU (2)L gauge theory. The rate for these so-called instanton transitions\n2\n2\nis proportional to e\u221216\u03c0 /g \u223c 10\u2212400 , and thus they are completely unobservable today [65].\nAt finite temperatures, however, it is possible for the system to pass over the tunnelling\nbarrier by classical thermal fluctuations called sphaleron transitions [66]. These transitions\nare active in the early universe for temperatures below T < 1012 GeV [67], but shut off\nquickly once the electroweak symmetry is broken at temperatures near T \u223c 100 GeV [68].\nDespite satisfying the necessary Sakharov conditions, there is no known mechanism to\ngenerate the baryon asymmetry within the Standard Model. The greatest obstacle is that\nthe Standard Model does not have large enough CP violation [69]. However, extensions of\nthe Standard Model proposed to solve the gauge hierarchy problem or to generate the dark\nmatter frequently contain new sources of CP violation [70]. Within many of these theories,\nthere exist viable mechanisms through which the baryon asymmetry can be created [62].\nTwo of the most popular baryogenesis mechanisms are leptogenesis [71] and electroweak\nbaryogenesis [72] In (standard) leptogenesis, an asymmetry in the lepton number L is created\nby the out-of-equilibrium decays of a very heavy neutrino. Such heavy neutrinos are wellmotivated since they can give rise to very small masses for the neutrinos in the Standard\nModel through the seesaw mechanism. The asymmetry in L created by heavy neutrino\ndecays is reprocessed by sphaleron transitions into a net baryon number. Unfortunately,\nwhile leptogenesis can generate the observed matter asymmetry, all the new physics associated with it is frequently much heavier than the electroweak scale making it inaccessible at\nupcoming particle colliders.\nIn contrast to leptogenesis, electroweak baryogenesis makes testable predictions for the\nTevatron and the LHC. Baryon production in electroweak baryogenesis occurs during the\nelectroweak phase transition. At temperatures well above the electroweak scale in the early\nuniverse the full SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y electroweak gauge symmetry is unbroken. As the universe\ncools, this symmetry is broken spontaneously down to the U (1)em gauge symmetry of electromagnetism. If this electroweak phase transition is strongly first order it proceeds through\n15\n\n\fthe nucleation of bubbles of broken U (1)em phase within the surrounding plasma of symmetric SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y phase. CP-violating interactions in the bubble walls generate a chiral\nasymmetry which is reprocessed by the sphalerons into a net baryon number density. The\nStandard Model does not have a strongly first-order phase transition for Higgs masses above\nO(60 GeV) [73], nor does it have enough CP violation [69] for electroweak baryogenesis to\nbe viable. However, with new physics such as an extended Higgs sector or supersymmetry,\nelectroweak baryogenesis can generate the matter asymmetry. This requires new particles\nthat can potentially be observed at the LHC, as well as new sources of CP violation that\nmight be found in upcoming searches for permanent electric dipole moments [74].\n\n16\n\n\fII.\n\nMODELS\n\nIn view of the experimental and theoretical shortcomings of the Standard Model, there\nhas been a steady flow of models for new TeV-scale physics over the last two decades.\nAs we will see in this section, not all of these models address all of the problems of the\nStandard Model. Some of them actually address none of them, and are simply motivated by\nexperimental limitations or field-theoretic structures. Others aim to connect physics at the\nelectroweak scale to a more fundamental description of Nature, such as a theory of quantum\ngravity.\nDespite these differences, the vast majority of models of new physics proposed to date\nfocus on two primary issues. First and foremost, they seek to explain electroweak symmetry\nbreaking and the associated puzzle of fundamental scalars. Secondly, any model which\nclaims to describe physics near the electroweak scale also has the potential to account for\nthe observed dark matter. The former is comparably hard and can involve many different\napproaches, from protecting a light fundamental scalar with some symmetry, to denying the\nexistence of fundamental high mass scales, to generating the weak scale through dimensional\ntransmutation. The latter can usually be solved by introducing some kind of discrete Z2\nsymmetry into a model of electroweak symmetry breaking containing new stable particles.\nIn passing, let us mention that we do not describe extended Higgs boson sectors in this\nsection except as they relate to the structure of the models we discuss. There is an extensive\nliterature on the Higgs boson and its extensions, including many excellent reviews [10, 20, 21].\nSuffice it to say there are general ways to parameterize Higgs sectors involving nearly any\nvariety of light Higgs resonance arising from different underlying models [75]. In addition,\nwe know how to combine all LHC signals channels from a light Higgs boson and compare\nthem to an effective theory of the Higgs sector, including a general set of couplings [76, 77].\nA.\n\nSupersymmetry\n\nSupersymmetry (SUSY) has long been a favorite candidate for new physics beyond the\nStandard Model. It naturally accounts for the large hierarchy between the Planck and\nthe electroweak scales, it provides an explanation for the underlying cause of electroweak\nsymmetry breaking, it strongly suggests the unification of the SU (3)c \u00d7 SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y\ngauge couplings into a simple group at high energies, and it can lead to viable candidates\nfor the dark matter and the source of the baryon asymmetry. At the same time, SUSY\nmaintains the greatest strength of the Standard Model \u2013 as a renormalizable perturbative\nfield theory, it allows for accurate theoretical predictions.\nAs such, many different models of SUSY have been constructed, and several of them have\nbeen used as benchmark theories by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations [78\u201380]. Even\nwithin the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM), a broad\npalette of final state signatures are possible, allowing for a thorough test of the capabilities\nof the LHC detectors for discovering new physics at the TeV scale. In this section we will\ndescribe the MSSM and some of its simple extensions, as well as some generic features of\ntheir phenomenology. For more detailed phenomenological discussions of supersymmetry,\nwe refer the reader to the many reviews [13, 39, 81] and textbooks [82] on the topic.\n\n17\n\n\f1.\n\nMSSM\n\nA primary field-theoretic motivation for supersymmetry is that it can stabilize the scale\nof electroweak symmetry breaking against large quantum corrections from new physics at\nhigher energies. Supersymmetry is an extension of the Poincar\u00e9 symmetries of spacetime\nthat relates bosons to fermions [83]. In doing so, it extends the generic chiral protection of\nfermion masses to the Higgs allowing for a fundamental scalar with a naturally small mass\nparameter.\nThe most simple realization of supersymmetry that is also the most straightforwardly\nconsistent with the Standard Model has a single anti-commuting chiral fermionic generator\nQ such that [82]\n{Q, Q} = 0, {Q, Q\u2020 } = 2\u03c3 \u03bc P\u03bc ,\n(13)\nwhere P\u03bc is the usual momentum generator. Acting on single-particle states,\nQ |bosoni \u223c |fermioni ,\n\nQ |fermioni \u223c |bosoni ,\n\n(14)\n\nwe see that supersymmetry relates bosons and fermions. Theories with a single chiral fermion\ngenerator Q are usually referred to as N = 1, reflecting that there is only a one irreducible\ngenerator. If Nature is supersymmetric, particles must fill out complete representations of\nthe supersymmetry group, in the same way that Poincar\u00e9 invariance allows us to classify\nstates into particles with definite mass and spin (or helicity). Within each representation,\nall component particles must have the same mass and quantum numbers, and the numbers\nof real fermionic and scalar degrees of freedom are equal to each other [82, 84].\nFor phenomenological applications, the most useful representations (in four spacetime\ndimensions) are the chiral and the massless vector supermultiplets [39, 82]. A chiral multiplet\n\u03a6 contains a complex scalar \u03c6 and a two-component chiral Weyl fermion \u03c8 [82]\n\u03a6 = (\u03c6, \u03c8) .\n\n(15)\n\nHere, we have used superfield notation, where \u03a6 represents all of its components at once [82,\n84]. Note that the chiral multiplet has an equal number of fermion and boson real degrees\nof freedom: the complex scalar \u03c6 has two real components and the chiral fermion \u03c8 has two\nindependent helicities. The massless vector multiplet V contains a vector field A\u03bc and a\nsingle chiral Weyl fermion \u03bb [82],\nV = (\u03bb, A\u03bc ) .\n(16)\nAs for the chiral supermultiplet, the numbers of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom\nmatch within the vector multiplet: the massless vector A\u03bc on its mass shell has two independent physical polarization states while the Weyl fermion has two helicities. This Weyl\nor Majorana nature of the fermions involved will have important phenomenological consequences which we will discuss later.\nTo extend the Standard Model to a supersymmetric theory, all the Standard Model states\nmust be embedded in supermultiplets [85]. Each of the SU (3)c \u00d7 SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y gauge\nfields is completed to form its own massless vector multiplet.

For each generation, the\nset of chiral multiplets is Q, U c , Dc , L, E c , where we list the corresponding component\nstates and quantum numbers in Table II. Each Standard Model fermion therefore has a\ncomplex scalar sfermion superpartner. The matched number of degrees of freedom \u2013 two\nreal scalar degrees of freedom for each of the helicities of a chiral Standard Model fermion\n\u2013 implies that one complex scalar superpartner field can be mapped onto each of the Weyl\nspinors forming a Standard Model Dirac fermion. We will see below that after accounting\nfor electroweak and supersymmetry breaking, the sfermion partners of the left- and righthanded components of a Standard Model fermion f are not mass-degenerate, and mix with\neach other to form mass eigenstates f \u03031,2 .\nThe Standard Model Higgs boson is also embedded in a pair of chiral multiplets. Two\nmultiplets are needed for this, Hu and Hd , for a couple of reasons. First, each multiplet has\na chiral fermion higgsino component that would induce a gauge anomaly if not for having a\npartner with opposite charge. Second, the structure of supersymmetric interactions (that we\nwill describe below) forces a chiral superfield and its conjugate to have the same interactions\nup to complex conjugation. As a result, we cannot use the Higgs field and its conjugate to\ngive mass to up-type and down-type fermions, as we do in the Standard Model. Instead,\ntwo distinct Higgs doublets are needed to give masses to both the up-type and down-type\nfermions of the Standard Model after electroweak symmetry breaking in a supersymmetric\ntheory.\nSupersymmetry also constrains the possible interactions in the theory. The general rule\nof thumb is that for each Standard Model vertex, supersymmetry leads to the corresponding\nvertices where any two of the legs on the Standard Model vertex are transformed into\nsuperpartners [39]. The two classes of interactions in the Standard Model are gauge and\nYukawa. Incorporating them into SUSY leads to new testable predictions.\nGauge interactions in SUSY are obtained by promoting ordinary derivatives to gauge\ncovariant derivatives, \u2202\u03bc \u2192 D\u03bc \u2261 (\u2202\u03bc + ig ta Aa\u03bc ), where ta is the gauge generator for the\nrepresentation of the target field and Aa is the gauge field. This gauge field originates\nfrom a massless vector supermultiplet which describes the on-shell degrees of freedom of\nthe component. To formulate a quantum-mechanical gauge theory, we should also include\noff-shell degrees of freedom, and doing so in supersymmetry forces us to add a real scalar\nauxiliary Da as part of the vector multiplet [82]. It is auxiliary in the sense that it does not\nhave a kinetic term, and will disappear from physical observables. Ensuring that the gauge\ncouplings are supersymmetric also requires additional couplings involving a matter fermion\n\n19\n\n\fSU (3)c \u00d7 SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y Fermions Bosons\n\u0012\nQ=\n\nUL\nDL\n\n\u0013\n\nUc\nDc\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03bdL\nL=\neL\nc\nE\n\u0012 +\u0013\nHu\nHu =\nH0\n\u0012 u0 \u0013\nHd\nHd =\nHd\u2212\n\nB\n\nL\n\nR\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-1/3 0\n-1/3 0\n\n-1\n-1\n\n\u0169L , d \u0303L 1/3\n\n(3, 2, 1/6)\n\nuL , dL\n\n(3\u0304, 1, -2/3)\n(3\u0304, 1, 1/3)\n\nu\u2020R\nd\u2020R\n\n\u0169\u2217R\nd \u0303\u2217R\n\n(1, 2, -1/2)\n\n\u03bdL , eL\n\n\u03bd\u0303L , \u1ebdL\n\n0\n\n1\n\n(1, 1, 1)\n\ne\u2020R\n\n\u1ebd\u2217R\n\n0\n\n-1 -1\n\n(1, 2, 1/2)\n\n0\nh\u0303+\nu , h\u0303u\n\nHu+ , Hu0\n\n0\n\n0 +1\n\n(1, 2, -1/2)\n\nh\u03030d , h\u0303\u2212\nd\n\nHd0 , Hd\u2212\n\n0\n\n0 +1\n\n-1\n\nTABLE II: Chiral supermultiplets in the MSSM.\n\n\u03c8i , its scalar superpartner \u03c6i , the gaugino \u03bba , and the auxiliary Da field [39, 82]:\n!\nX \u2020\nX \u2020\n\u221a\n1\n\u03c6i ta \u03c6i Da \u2212 DaDa .\n\u03c6i ta \u03bba \u03c8i + h.c. \u2212 g\n\u2212 Lgauge = 2g\n2\ni\ni\n\n(17)\n\nThe first term can be thought of as a supersymmetrization of the usual fermion gauge\ncoupling, with one fermion replaced by its scalar superpartner and the gauge field replaced\nby its gaugino.\nThe second and third terms are the only Lagrangian couplings involving the auxiliary\na\nD P\nfield.

All three of them\nhave the same value to all orders in perturbation theory due to supersymmetry. However,\ncomputing higher orders using dimensional regularization can break supersymmetry explicitly if it is not applied carefully: while the Weyl gluino has two degrees of freedom in any\nnumber of dimensions, the gluon has d\u22122 degrees of freedom in d dimensions. This spurious\nSUSY-breaking effect can be compensated by a finite shift in gq\u0303qg\u0303 [86, 87].\nAll other renormalizable non-gauge interactions in a supersymmetric theory can be\nderived from a superpotential W (\u03a6i ) that is a function of the chiral supermultiplets\n\u03a6i = (\u03c6i , \u03c8i ) in the theory [39, 82]. An important property of the superpotential is that\nit is holomorphic, in that it depends only on the supermultiplet fields \u03a6i and not on their\ncomplex conjugates. For example, the most general possible cubic superpotential is given\nby W (\u03a6) = fi \u03a6i + mij \u03a6i \u03a6j + \u03bbijk \u03a6i \u03a6j \u03a6k .

The Fi in Eq. (19) are complex scalar auxiliary fields related to \u03a6i . They\nare analogous to the Da fields in that they account for the off-shell degrees of freedom of\nthe chiral multiplets. They also do not have kinetic terms, so their algebraic equations of\nmotion are simply Fi\u2020 = \u2212 \u2202W/\u2202\u03a6i |0 . Plugging these back into Eq.

(19) links the scalar masses and the fermion masses to each other.\nThis ensures that, in the absence of supersymmetry breaking, the scalar masses will vanish\nin the chiral limit of the fermion masses going to zero.\nThe superpotential of the MSSM is given by\nWMSSM = yu Q*Hu U c \u2212 yd Q*Hd Dc \u2212 ye L*Hd E c + \u03bc Hu *Hd ,\n\n(21)\n\nwhere the Yukawa couplings yu , yd and ye are 3 \u00d7 3 matrices in flavor space, and SU (2)L\ndoublet indices are connected anti-symmetrically such that A * B = a1 b2 \u2212 a2 b1 for A =\n(a1 , a2 )t and B = (b1 , b2 )t . The bilinear fermion couplings derived from this superpotential\nreproduce the Yukawa interactions of the Standard Model along with a Dirac mass term for\nthe Higgsinos. Note that as claimed above, the holomorphicity of the superpotential requires\ntwo Higgs doublets to give mass to all the Standard Model fermions. Scalar masses and selfcouplings are generated by the F -term potential. Since the MSSM superpotential has terms\nonly up to cubic order, the Lagrangian derived from it using the formula of Eq. (19) is\nrenormalizable.\nUnlike the Standard Model Lagrangian, the MSSM superpotential of Eq.(21) does not\ncontain every possible renormalizable term that is consistent with the gauge symmetries of\nthe theory. Several perfectly gauge-invariant superpotential terms such as L*Q U c , U c Dc Dc ,\nand L * Hu are not included in the MSSM because they violate baryon (B) or lepton (L)\nnumber conservation and would lead to severe problems like the rapid decay of the proton or\nlepton flavor mixing. The standard way to justify the absence of these dangerous operators\nin the MSSM is to impose an additional discrete symmetry on the Lagrangian called Rparity [39, 88]. This is a Z2 symmetry under which each field has charge\nR = (\u22121)(3B\u2212L)+2s ,\n\n(22)\n\nwhere s is the spin of the state. Thus, the fermions of the Standard Model as well as the\ngauge and Higgs bosons all have R = +1, while the sfermions, higgsinos, and gauginos have\nR = \u22121. Note that the components within a given supermultiplet have opposite R-parities.\nA very important phenomenological implication of R-parity is that the R = \u22121 superpartner\n21\n\n\f\u223c\n\u03c8\n\n\u03c8\n\n+\n\n=0\n\nFIG. 4: Cancellation of quadratic corrections in SUSY\n\nparticles can only be created or destroyed in pairs. As a result, the lightest superpartner,\nthe LSP, is absolutely stable if R-parity is an exact symmetry. If the LSP is also neutral\nunder color and electromagnetism, it can provide a promising candidate for the dark matter\nin our universe [43, 50].\nHaving extended the Standard Model to include supersymmetry, let us now go back and\nexamine our motivation for going to all this trouble in the first place. As discussed in\nSection I, the electroweak scale in the Standard Model is unstable under quantum corrections from new physics at high energies [36, 37] The source of the instability are quadratic\ncorrections to the mass term for the scalar Higgs field. In supersymmetry, the Higgs is\nembedded into a pair of chiral supermultiplets, and supersymmetry relates its mass to that\nof the fermionic higgsino superpartners. Since the masses of fermions enjoy a chiral protection and are only logarithmically sensitive to new physics at higher energies, the corrections\nto the Higgs mass parameters in supersymmetry can only be logarithmic as well. These\nremaining corrections are numerically small enough to not be dangerous. In terms of Feynman diagrams, the quadratic corrections to the Higgs are found to cancel between loops of\nsuperpartners. For example, the quadratic divergence in the top quark loop correction to\nthe Higgs mass parameter is cancelled off by a loop containing the scalar top superpartner,\nwhich we illustrate in Fig. 4. Beyond stabilizing the gauge hierarchy, supersymmetry with\nR-parity can also produce a viable dark matter candidate [43], and can lead to the grand\nunification of the SU (3)c \u00d7 SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y gauge couplings at very high energies near\nMGUT ' 1016 GeV [89].\nThis great blessing of supersymmetry, that it relates the masses of bosons to fermions,\nis also its curse. If supersymmetry were a manifest symmetry of Nature, each Standard\nModel fermion would have a scalar superpartner with exactly the same mass and charge\nand we would have discovered them already [39, 82, 90]. Instead, supersymmetry must be\nbroken. As long as the breaking is soft, with only non-supersymmetric interactions that\nhave dimensionful couplings of size msoft , the theory will be approximately supersymmetric\nat energies above msoft [91]. In particular, the quadratic corrections to the Higgs mass\nterms will be cut off near msoft and on the order of \u2206mH \u223c msoft /4\u03c0 [91]. Therefore softly\nbroken supersymmetry can stabilize the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking provided\nmsoft . 4\u03c0 mW \u223c 1 TeV. This is the main motivation to search for TeV-scale supersymmetry\nin particle colliders.\n\n22\n\n\fThe complete set of soft supersymmetry breaking terms in the MSSM is [39]\n\u2212Lsoft = m2Hd |Hd |2 + m2Hu |Hu |2 \u2212 (B\u03bc Hu *Hd + h.c.)\n+ m2Q |Q\u0303|2 + m2U c |\u0168 c |2 + m2D |D\u0303c |2 + m2L |L\u0303|2 + m2E |\u1ebc c |2\n\u0011\n\u0010\nc\nc\nc\nc\n+ yu Au Q\u0303*Hu \u0168 * Q\u0303i \u0168j \u2212 yd Ad Q\u0303*Hd \u0168 \u2212 ye Ae L\u0303*Hd \u1ebc + h.c.\n\u0011\n1 \u0010\na a\nd\nd\n0 0\n+\nM3 g\u0303 g\u0303 + M2 W\u0303 W\u0303 + M1 B\u0303 B\u0303 + h.c. .\n2\n\n(23)\n\nThe terms in the first line of this equation contribute to the potential for the Higgs bosons.\nThe squared masses in the second line and the trilinear couplings on the third and line\ngenerate masses and mixings for the sfermions. Couplings of the form cijk \u03c6\u2217i \u03c6j \u03c6k are also soft\nwithin the MSSM, but they tend to be tiny in most models of supersymmetry breaking [91].\nNote that we have suppressed flavor indices in these terms. The final line contains mass\nterms for the gauginos. These masses are Majorana, which are possible here since the\ngauginos transform in the adjoint of their respective gauge group, and a pair of adjoints can\nbe contracted to form a singlet.\nThe presence of Majorana gluino masses is an important reflection of minimal supersymmetry. Matching the degrees of freedom of the gluon, the gluino must have two on-shell\ndegrees of freedom - not enough to form a Dirac spinor. Two degrees of freedom, on the\nother hand, are sufficient to construct a Majorana spinor out of one Weyl spinor. In this\nsense, the Majorana nature of the gluino is a prediction of minimal embedding of SU (3)c\nin supersymmetry. The situation is slightly more subtle for the electroweak gauginos, because electroweak symmetry breaking marries at least the charged gauginos and higgsinos\ninto Dirac states. Combined with the soft supersymmetry-breaking masses for the winos\nand bino, the result is four Majorana neutralinos and two Dirac charginos, where the latter\ndespite being Dirac reflect their Majorana origins through the presence of fermion number\nviolating couplings to fermion/sfermion pairs.\nSuperpartner masses, or more precisely the mass splitting between Standard Model and\nsuperpartner masses, are determined by the soft terms in Eq. (23). The precise values\nof these soft terms depend on the origin of supersymmetry breaking. This is a messy\nbusiness [92], and nearly all viable theories for its origin have the underlying dynamics in\na separate sector that is hidden from the MSSM fields [39, 81]. Supersymmetry breaking\nis then communicated to the MSSM by messenger interactions. In gravity mediation, these\ninteractions\nconsist of higher-dimensional operators suppressed by the Planck mass MPl [93\u2013\n\u221a\n97]. If F characterizes the mass scale of supersymmetry breaking in the hidden sector, the\nMSSM soft terms are then on the order of\nmsoft \u223c\n\nF\n,\nMPl\n\n(24)\n\nimplying that F \u223c (1011 GeV)2 is needed for msoft \u223c TeV. In gauge mediation, supersymmetry breaking is communicated by a set of messenger fields with masses Mmess that couple to\nthe source of supersymmetry breaking and are charged under SU (3)c \u00d7 SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y [98\u2013\n100]. They lead to MSSM soft terms on the order of\nmsoft \u223c\n\ng2\nF\n,\n(4\u03c0)2 Mmess\n23\n\n(25)\n\n\fwhere g represents a Standard Model gauge coupling. Relative to gravity mediation, gauge\nmediation allows for a much lower scale of supersymmetry breaking provided Mmess \u001c\nMPl /(4\u03c0)2 . Other popular forms of supersymmetry breaking include anomaly mediation [101\u2013104] and gaugino mediation [105\u2013107].\nWhile supersymmetry breaking is needed to make the superpartners heavy enough to\naccount for why we have not discovered them yet, it can also be a source of new phenomenological problems. The scalar soft terms in Eq. (23) can be a new source of flavor mixing [108].\nFor example, m2Q |Q\u0303|2 represents (m2Q )ij Q\u0303\u2020i Q\u0303j , and yu Au Q\u0303*Hu \u0168 c stands for (yu Au )ij Q\u0303i*Hu \u0168jc .\nBoth (m2f \u0303)ij and (yf Af )ij can have off-diagonal entries that mix the different generations.\nNew flavor mixing beyond the CKM matrix of the Standard Model is strongly constrained,\nand the soft terms must obey some kind of flavor symmetry similar to the Standard model;\nfor example, they could be approximately universal and diagonal or aligned [109]. Moreover,\nthe gaugino masses and the A- and B-type scalar soft terms in Eq. (23) are generically\ncomplex, and could lead to unacceptably large CP violating effects [108] such as permanent\nelectric dipole moments. Consistency with observations typically requires such phases to be\nfairly small [110]. It is a challenge for models of supersymmetry breaking to generate soft\nterms that respect these phenomenological constraints on flavor and CP. Gravity mediation\noften runs into difficulties on both fronts, while gauge mediation produces acceptably flavoruniversal soft terms but can still induce too much CP violation [100].\nOn top of determining the masses of the superpartners, the soft supersymmetry breaking\ncouplings are also responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking within the MSSM. The\nscalar potential for the Higgs scalars at tree-level is given by\nVH = Vsoft + VF + VD = m2Hu |Hu |2 + m2Hd |Hd |2 \u2212 (B\u03bc Hu *Hd + h.c.)\n\u00012\ng 2 + g 02\n|Hu |2 \u2212 |Hd |2 .\n+ |\u03bc|2 (|Hu |2 + |Hd |2 ) +\n8\n\n(26)\n\nHere, the first line comes from soft SUSY breaking terms, the second line from the F -term\nand D-term potentials. This potential can induce a vacuum expectation value for the Higgs\nfields if one or both of their scalar soft masses is negative at low energies.\nIndeed, this occurs very naturally in many models of supersymmetry breaking due to the\neffect of the large top quark Yukawa coupling on the renormalization group running of m2Hu\nbelow the messenger mass scale [111]. After being destabilized at the origin by a negative\nsoft mass, the potential will be stabilized further out in the field space by the quartic terms\nin the potential, provided |Hu | =\n6 |Hd |. Note that the MSSM's quartic terms in Eq. (26)\ncome entirely from the D-term contributions to the potential. This is much more restrictive\nthan the Standard Model where the Higgs quartic coupling is an independent and potentially\ntroublesome parameter in the theory.\nBy making an electroweak gauge transformation, any Higgs vacuum expectation can be\nrotated into the neutral components with no loss of generality. A further change of field\nvariables allows us to assume that B\u03bc is real and positive [39]. The minimum of the potential\nthen has real and positive expectation values for the neutral components of Hu and Hd :\nhHu0 i = v sin \u03b2,\n\nhHd0 i = v cos \u03b2,\n\n(27)\n\nwhere v = 174 GeV and sin \u03b2, cos \u03b2 > 0. After electroweak symmetry breaking, one neutral\nand one charged pseudoscalar combination of the Higgs multiplets are eaten by the electroweak gauge bosons [10, 21]. The remaining five physical scalar states are two CP-even\n24\n\n\fneutral states h0 and H 0 with mh0 < mH 0 , one CP-odd neutral state A0 , and one charged\nHiggs pair H \u00b1 . We list these states in Table III.\nElectroweak symmetry breaking leads to mixing among the gauginos and Higgsinos. The\nneutral components of these states mix to form four Majorana neutralinos. In the basis\n\u03c8\u0303i0 = (B\u0303 0 , W\u0303 3 , H\u0303d0 , H\u0303u0 ), the neutralino mass matrix is given by [39]\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nM1\n0\n\u2212c\u03b2 sW mZ s\u03b2 sW mZ\n\uf8ec\n0\nM2\nc\u03b2 cW mZ \u2212s\u03b2 cW mZ \uf8f7\n\uf8f7 .\n(28)\nM(0) = \uf8ec\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed \u2212c\u03b2 sW mZ c\u03b2 cW mZ\n0\n\u2212\u03bc\ns\u03b2 sW mZ \u2212s\u03b2 cW mZ\n\u2212\u03bc\n0\nThis can be diagonalized by a unitary matrix N such that N \u2217 M(0) N \u2020 , producing the neutralino mass eigenstates \u03c7\u03030i = Nij \u03c8\u0303i0 , ordered so that mi \u2264 mi+1 [39, 112]. Since the\nneutralino mass matrix contains Majorana gaugino soft masses, all mass eigenstates will be\nMajorana fermions as well. The off-diagonal terms in Eq. (28) mixing gauginos with Higgsinos originate from supersymmetrized gauge couplings of the form given in the first term\nof Eq. (17), where the scalar field is a Higgs replaced by its expectation value. To measure\nthese off-diagonal entries we cannot rely only on determining the four physical neutralino\nmasses, but have to include an actual neutralino-Higgs coupling measurement [113].\nThe neutral color octet gluino is also a Majorana fermion with tree-level mass M3 . On\naccount of its quantum numbers, it is unable to mixing with the Higgsinos or anything else.\nThe charged components of the gauginos and Higgsinos mix to form chargino fermions.\n+\n\u2212\nTheir mass matrix in the basis (\u03c8\u0303i , \u03c8\u0303i ) = (W\u0303 + , H\u0303u+ , W\u0303 \u2212 , H\u0303d\u2212 ) according to\n\u221a\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0 Xt\nM\n2s\nm\n2\n\u03b2\nW\n(\u00b1)\nM\n=\nwhere\nX= \u221a\n.\n(29)\nX 0\n2c\u03b2 mW\n\u03bc\nThis matrix can be bi-diagonalized by a pair of unitary matrices U and V according to\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\nU \u2217 M(\u00b1) V \u2020 [39, 112].

In contrast to the neutralinos, the charginos are Dirac\nfermions, as required for electrically charged states. As for the neutralinos, gaugino-Higgsino\nmixing among these charged states still originates from terms of the form of Eq. (17).\nElectroweak and supersymmetry breaking also causes the scalar superpartners of the leftand right-handed fermions to mix with each other.

In\nwriting these out we assume that left-right scalar mixing is only significant for the third generation.\nStates are conventionally labelled in order of increasing mass: mi \u2264 mi+1 .\n\nNote that the left-right sfermion mixing for both types of sfermions is proportional to the\ncorresponding fermion mass mf (subject to our definition of the trilinear A terms). Thus, as\nlong as the trilinear soft terms Af are of similar size for all generations, this mixing will be the\nmost pronounced in the third generation. In many phenomenological analyses, the mixing\namong the first two generation is neglected and the mass eigenstates are identified with the\nchiral eigenstates. We list the complete set of Higgs and superpartner mass eigenstates in\nthe MSSM in Table III.\nBeyond the Standard Model superpartners, the MSSM contains one additional superpartner related to gravity. Even though the MSSM is a model of particle physics at energies\nwell below the Planck scale, if supersymmetry and supersymmetry breaking are present we\nexpect that they will apply to the gravitational interactions as well. The extension of supersymmetry to include gravity requires that this global symmetry is extended to a local\nsymmetry, unsurprisingly called supergravity [114]. This is the supersymmetric analog of extending the global Poincar\u00e9 symmetry of special relativity to the local coordinate invariance\nsymmetry of general relativity. In doing so, the spin-2 graviton field is embedded within a\nsupermultiplet containing a spin-3/2 gravitino field G\u0303. The gravitino is massless when supersymmetry is exact, but it acquires a mass through the super-Higgs mechanism by eating\nthe spin-1/2 goldstino fermion generated when supersymmetry is broken [115, 116]. The\nresulting gravitino mass is\nF\n.\n(33)\nm3/2 = \u221a\n3MPl\nThus, the gravitino is about as heavy as the MSSM superpartners in gravity mediation, but\ncan be much lighter in gauge mediation. Since the gravitino has odd R-parity, the lightest\nMSSM superpartner in scenarios with gauge mediation can be unstable against decaying to\nits Standard Model counterpart and the gravitino. This has important phenomenological\nimplications that we will address below.\n26\n\n\fCollider signals of the MSSM depend very much on the superpartner mass spectrum as\nwell as the relative mass of the gravitino. The case most commonly studied is when the\nlightest superpartner particle (LSP) is one of the MSSM states, and not the gravitino. This\noccurs in theories where supersymmetry is broken at a high scale, such as gravity mediation\nor anomaly mediation. Cosmological bounds together with searches for exotic stable charged\nparticles typically require that the LSP be neutral under color and electromagnetism if it is\nto make up the dark matter [117]. This leaves the neutralinos and the sneutrinos as possible\nweakly interacting candidates. Of these two, the lightest neutralino makes for a much\nbetter dark matter candidate in the presence of experimental limits from direct detection\nexperiments [118], and most investigations of MSSM collider signals assume that it is the\nLSP as we will do here.\nTo study supersymmetric signatures and develop strategies for LHC searches between\ntheory and experiment it is useful to have simple benchmark models [119]. Historically, a\nstandard framework including a neutralino LSP was minimal supergravity (mSUGRA), also\ncalled the constrained MSSM (cMSSM). Here, a set of universal soft terms are assumed at\na very high input scale on the order of MGUT = 2 \u00d7 1016 GeV. Specifically, all scalar soft\nmasses are set to a common flavor-diagonal value m0 , all trilinear A terms are set to A0 , and\nall gaugino soft masses are taken to be m1/2 at the scale MGUT . The low-energy value of\ntan \u03b2 and the sign of the superpotential \u03bc term are specified at the weak scale, in addition\nto assuming that electroweak symmetry is broken. With these five inputs the low-energy\nHiggs and superpartner spectrum is fully determined after extrapolating the soft terms\ndown to near the electroweak scale by renormalization group running. Let us emphasize,\nhowever, that while the mSUGRA framework is very useful for defining benchmark models,\nit has very little theoretical motivation and should not be taken too seriously. In particular,\nwe should not mistake experimental constraints on such simplified benchmark models for\nconstraints on TeV-scale supersymmetry [120\u2013122]. For example, the assumption of gaugino\nmass unification places a very strong constraint on the spectrum that the bino will be\nroughly half as heavy as the wino. This limits the bino mass since the wino leads to a\nchargino whose mass limit is roughly half the LEP2 energy. Instead, we can derive the lower\nbound on the LSP mass either including the measured relic density (yielding values in the\nGeV range) [122], or without this requirement in which case the lightest neutralino can be\npractically massless [123].\nWith a neutralino LSP and a superpartner mass spectrum that is not too spread out,\nthe generic picture of MSSM phenomenology at a hadron collider is as follows. Most of\nthe superpartner production is in the form of squarks and gluinos on account of their QCD\ncharges. They must be created in pairs due to R-parity. Once produced, each colored\nsuperpartner decays promptly to a lighter superpartner and one or more Standard Model\nstates. These decays continue until the LSP is created, at which point the decay cascade\nends. Being stable and uncharged, the LSP leaves the detector carrying some of the energy\nand momentum of the event with it. This process gives rise to events with energetic jets,\npossibly a few leptons, and missing transverse energy. Such signatures and their LHCspecific issues will be discussed in detail in Section III B, while the extraction of underlying\nparameters including detailed experimental simulations are presented in Section IV.\nThe collider phenomenology of the MSSM can be very different when a light gravitino\nis the LSP. This can occur when supersymmetry breaking is transferred to the MSSM by\nmessengers that are much lighter than the Planck scale, as occurs in gauge mediation. The\nmassive spin-3/2 gravitino G\u0303 has transverse components coming from the massless spin-3/2\n27\n\n\fsuperpartner of the graviton as well as longitudinal components from the massless spin-1/2\ngoldstino [116]. At energies much larger than the gravitino mass, the goldstino components\ncouple to the MSSM fields with strength 1/F , which is much stronger than the transverse\n2\n[116, 124, 125]. This feature is sometimes called the goldstino\ncoupling proportional to 1/MPl\nequivalence principle, in analogy with the similar situation for Higgsed gauge bosons. The\ngravitino-matter coupling connects a particle X with its superpartner X\u0303, and therefore\nallows the superpartner to decay to the gravitino G\u0303 at the rate [124]\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u00134\n\u00134\nm5X\u0303\nm2X\n1 m5X\u0303\nm2X\n1\n1\u2212\n\u0393(X\u0303 \u2192 G\u0303X) =\n1\u2212\n=\n.\n(34)\n2\n16\u03c0 F 2\nmX\u0303 2\n48\u03c0 m23/2 MPl\nmX\u0303 2\n\u221a\nFor low supersymmetry breaking scales F . 106 GeV, or equivalently m3/2 . 100 keV,\nthese superpartner decays can be fast enough to be seen in particle colliders.\nWhen the gravitino is the LSP, the typical collider picture that emerges is that superpartners are produced in pairs, and decay in a cascade down to the next-to-lightest superpartner (NLSP) in much the same way as when the LSP is a Standard Model superpartner [126].\nAt the LHC we generally expect that the QCD-charged superpartners will be produced most\noften, so these cascades will generally be accompanied by hard jets. If the NLSP is long-lived\non collider time scales, it will simply leave the detector. However, since it will later decay\nto the neutral gravitino LSP, it can carry an electromagnetic or color charge and still be\nconsistent with cosmological constraints [127]. A charged NLSP can leave highly-ionizing\ncharged tracks in the detector, while a colored NLSP will hadronize and may also produce\nvisible tracks [128\u2013130]. When the NLSP decays to its superpartner and a gravitino within\nthe detector, there will be an additional energetic particle and a reduced amount of missing\nenergy carried by the gravitino.\nThe collider signatures of supersymmetry with a gravitino LSP depend strongly on the\nlifetime and the identity of the NLSP. The NLSP lifetime is the inverse of the decay width\ngiven in Eq. (34). Details of supersymmetry breaking determine the NLSP identity. In\nminimal models of gauge mediation, the NLSP is either a mostly-bino neutralino or a mostly\nright-handed stau (scalar tau) [126, 131] More general models of gauge mediation [132] can\nlead to other varieties of NLSPs such as a mostly-wino or higgsino neutralino [133, 134], a\nchargino [135], a sneutrino [136], or a squark [137] or gluino [138, 139].\nA mostly-bino neutralino decays primarily through \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 \u03b3 G\u0303 with a subleading decay\n0\n\u03c7\u03031 \u2192 Z 0 G\u0303. For prompt decays of a bino NLSP, the resulting pair of photons in each\nsupersymmetric event provides a handle to efficiently reduce the Standard Model backgrounds [126, 131, 140]. We illustrate this feature in Fig. 5, which shows the results from\na study by the ATLAS collaboration of a GMSB scenario containing a mostly-bino NLSP\nthat decays promptly. There is a clear excess of multi-photon signal events over the estimated background. The kinematic distribution of the outgoing photons can also be used\nto extract the mass of the neutralino NLSP [141]. In the intermediate regime where the\nthe neutralino decay is delayed but still occurs inside the detector, the resulting photons\nneed not point back to the interaction vertex. This makes it harder to identify the photons,\nbut may also allow for a determination of the NLSP lifetime from the amount of vertical\ndisplacement [80, 142]. Very slow decays of a bino NLSP simply lead to missing energy with\nno visible photons.\nWhen a mostly right-handed stau \u03c4\u03031 is the NLSP it will decay through \u03c4\u03031 \u2192 \u03c4 G\u0303, and a\nnew set of signals emerges [126, 131, 143]. Prompt decays imply that most supersymmetric\n28\n\n\fNumber of events [1 fb -1]\n\n105\n\nATLAS\n\nGMSB1\nZ\nW\ntt\nJets\n\n104\n103\n102\n10\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nN\u03b3\n\nFIG. 5: Estimated number of GMSB signal events at the LHC containing photons with p\u03b3T >\n20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5 from a GMSB scenario with a mostly bino NLSP that decays promptly to\nthe gravitino. Also shown are the estimated Standard Model backgrounds. There is a clear excess\nabove background in the multi-photon channels. The diagram is from Ref. [80].\n\nevents will be accompanied by a pair of taus and missing energy. Moreover, for lower values\nof tan \u03b2 and small A-terms there is very little left-right mixing, and the stau NLSP is\nnearly degenerate with the right-handed selectron \u1ebdR and the right-handed smuon \u03bc\u0303R . In\nthis case the very slightly heavier selectrons and smuons can behave as co-NLSPs, decaying\nprimarily to their respective superpartners and the gravitino instead of first going to the\nstau. This leads to muons or electrons and missing energy in some of the supersymmetric\ncascades, in addition to taus. Longer-lived \u03c4\u03031 NLSPs can produce displaced vertices from\ntheir decays as well as charged tracks. When the \u03c4\u03031 is stable on collider scales, it will produce\na highly-ionizing charged track that extends all the way out to the muon chamber [129, 130].\nSignatures of such long-lived charged exotics will be discussed in Section III E.\nSignatures of other NLSP candidates have not been studied in as much detail. A mostlywino neutralino NLSP can decay through \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 \u03b3 G\u0303 and \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 Z 0 G\u0303, while a mostly higgsino\nneutralino NLSP can also decay significantly via \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 h0 G\u0303 [133]. These neutralino vari+\neties can also have a chargino co-NLSP that decays through \u03c7\u0303+\n1 \u2192 W G\u0303 [144]. Promptly\ndecaying wino or higgsino NLSPs are typically more difficult to distinguish from Standard\nModel backgrounds than a mostly-bino state decaying to a photon [133]. Chargino [135]\nor sneutrino [136] NLSPs can also lead to interesting signatures. A squark or gluino NLSP\nwould produce additional hard jets in every supersymmetric event if it decays quickly.\nIn certain regions of the MSSM parameter space there can arise squarks and gluinos that\nare quasi-stable on collider scales. This includes long-lived squark and gluino NLSPs in\ngauge mediation. A further possibility is split supersymmetry, which is simply the MSSM in\nthe limit where all scalar superpartners are pushed to be much heavier than the superpartner\nfermions [145, 146]. The low energy spectrum then consists of the Standard Model with a\nsingle light Higgs boson together with the gluino, chargino, and neutralino superpartners.\nWhile the MSSM in this limit no longer stabilizes the electroweak scale, it still preserves\nthe nice properties of gauge unification and a dark matter candidate [147]. Due to the\ndecoupled scalars, split supersymmetry generically avoids constraints from flavor mixing\n29\n\n\fand CP violation.\nThe only new accessible colored particle in split supersymmetry is the gluino. To decay,\nit has to go through a heavy squark, either off-shell in a three body g\u0303 \u2192 q q\u0304 0 \u03c70,\u00b1 mode, or\nthrough a loop in the radiative g\u0303 \u2192 g\u03c70 channel [148]. These channels lead to a gluino\nlifetime on the order of\n\u00134 \u0012\n\u00135\n\u0012\n1000 GeV\nm\u0303\n,\n(35)\n\u03c4 \u223c (10 s)\n109 GeV\nmg\u0303\nwhere m\u0303 is the typical mass of the squarks. Cosmological bounds on late decays of a gluino\nlimit m\u0303 . 109 GeV for mg\u0303 > 300 GeV, assuming an otherwise standard cosmological history.\nUnder these circumstances, the gluino will hadronize long before it decays by combining with\ntwo or three quarks or a gluon to form a heavy color-singlet R-hadron [88, 113, 130, 149].\nStable squarks will also form R-hadrons with similar collider properties. We will discuss\nsome of the novel LHC signals of R-hadrons in more detail in Section III E.\nThe very heavy scalars in split supersymmetry make it more difficult to establish the\npresence of supersymmetry using collider measurements. The existence these scalars can\nonly be deduced indirectly through their effects on mediating three-body (or loop-level twobody) gluino decays. To gain information about these effects it is crucial to measure the\ngluino production and decay rates very carefully, taking into account QCD effects described\nin Section III A [150]. A second important test of the underlying supersymmetric structure\nis to measure the off-diagonal terms within the neutralino and chargino mass matrices given\nin Eq. (28) and Eq. (29). These couplings are fixed by the supersymmetrization of gauge\ninteractions described before Eq. (17), with a Higgs field coupling to a higgsino and a\ngaugino. When supersymmetry is broken, however, these couplings evolve differently under\nthe renormalization group below the scale of the sfermion masses than the couplings of the\ngauge bosons to fermions. The size of these effects are in the range of 10-20% [146, 151],\nbut it is unclear whether the LHC will be able to measure this even in the most optimistic\nscenario.\n2.\n\nExtended supersymmetric models\n\nThe minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model is able to stabilize the\ngauge hierarchy and can give rise to a viable dark matter candidate and gauge unification [39]. While these results are impressive, the model also leads to some new puzzles,\nand the most pressing of them have to do with the minimal structure of the MSSM Higgs\nsector. As a result, many of the proposed modifications of the MSSM extend the minimal\ntwo-Higgs doublet format. The simplest possibility is to add a singlet field S, but other wellmotivated alternatives include extended gauge structures and additional higher-dimensional\nHiggs operators. Going beyond the Higgs sector there is a wide range of additional interesting possibilities, such as a fourth generation of quark and lepton supermultiplets, scenarios\nwith an exact U (1)R global symmetry, and extensions containing a new hidden sector. In\nthis section we discuss some of these proposed MSSM extensions, their motivation and the\nstructure of their collider signals.\nBefore discussing MSSM extensions, let us first examine where the MSSM itself runs into\ndifficulty. There are two main puzzles, both related the MSSM Higgs sector: the fine-tuning\n30\n\n\fproblem, and the \u03bc-problem. The fine-tuning problem arises from the fact that the structure\nof the MSSM Higgs sector makes it difficult for all the Higgs states to avoid the direct and\nindirect constraints on them. At tree-level, the mass of the lighter CP-even Higgs boson is\nbounded by [10, 21, 39]:\nm2h \u2264 m2Z cos2 2\u03b2 < m2Z .\n(36)\nThe maximum value is reached in the decoupling limit, where all heavy Higgs states are\ngoverned by a high mass scale mA0 \u223c mH 0 \u223c mH \u00b1 \u001d mZ . In this limit all heavy Higgs states\ndecouple from the theory, and the h0 state behaves exactly like the Standard Model Higgs\nboson whose mass is bounded by the LEP experiments mhSM > 114.4 GeV at 95% CL [25].\nNote that this decoupling limit of the supersymmetric Higgs sector generally holds, but\nit requires an appropriate treatment of \u03bc and the sparticle masses, to avoid artificially\nintroducing non-decoupling effects [152].\nThe LEP limit does not rule out the MSSM since loop corrections increase the physical\nHiggs mass above the tree-level value. The leading contribution generally comes from the\nscalar tops, and in the absence of left-right stop mixing (and in the decoupling limit) is given\nby [10, 21, 39, 153, 154]\n\u2206m2h =\n\nmt\u0303L mt\u0303R\n12\n2\n2 2\nsin\n\u03b2\ny\nm\nlog\nt\nt\n(4\u03c0)2\nm2t\n\n(37)\n\nThis mass shift can be large due to the top Yukawa coupling and an enhancement by the\nlarge logarithm of the stop masses relative to the top mass. For heavy stops mt\u0303L,R & 1 TeV\nand relatively large values of tan \u03b2 & 10, this is enough to push the physical h0 mass above\nthe LEP limit.\nUnfortunately heavy stops also imply a certain degree of fine-tuning in the model. One\nof the conditions for electroweak symmetry breaking in the MSSM is [10, 21, 39]\nm2Z = \u22122 |\u03bc|2 \u2212\n\n2 m2Hu tan2 \u03b2 \u2212 2 m2Hd\n' \u22122 |\u03bc|2 \u2212 2 m2Hu ,\ntan2 \u03b2 \u2212 1\n\n(38)\n\nwhere the second approximate equality holds for tan \u03b2 \u001d 1. The large top Yukawa does\nnot only have a beneficial effect on the light Higgs mass. When the MSSM stops are heavy,\nthe value of m2Hu is also driven to large negative values in the course of renormalization\ngroup (RG) running [39]\n12 yt2 2\n\u039b\n\u2206m2Hu ' \u2212\nmt\u0303 log\n,\n(39)\n2\n(4\u03c0)\nmt\u0303\nwhere mt\u0303 represents a common stop mass and \u039b is a large energy scale, possibly motivated\nby unification, where we start the RG running. If |m2Hu | is much larger than m2Z , a very\nprecise cancellation between |\u03bc|2 and m2Hu is then required in Eq. (38). Since the values\nof |\u03bc|2 and m2Hu need not be related to each other in any particular way, this represents a\nfine-tuning problem of the MSSM. It can be slightly alleviated splitting the two stop masses\nand introducing a large stop mixing parameter (At \u2212 \u03bc/ tan \u03b2) [154, 155].\nThe MSSM fine-tuning problem leads in directly to the MSSM \u03bc-problem. To induce\nelectroweak symmetry breaking at the observed scale, the supersymmetric \u03bc-term must\ncancel against m2Hu which arises only from supersymmetry breaking. However, from the\npoint of view of the low-energy effective theory, there is no reason why the value of \u03bc\nshould even be near the weak scale, instead of having a much larger value on the order of\n31\n\n\fMGUT or MPl . This puzzle is called the \u03bc-problem. The only good news is that since \u03bc is\nsupersymmetric, once it is set to a small value it will stay there after including quantum\ncorrections.\nIn some cases it is possible to connect the \u03bc-term to supersymmetry breaking, such as\nthrough the Giudice-Masiero mechanism [156]. This mechanism involves imposing additional\nsymmetries on the theory at high energy that forbid a bare \u03bc-term, but allow a coupling\nbetween the source of supersymmetry breaking and the operator Hu*Hd . An effective \u03bc-term\nis then generated when supersymmetry is broken. However, in many cases (usually when\nmsoft \u001c m3/2 ), this mechanism also leads to a B\u03bc soft term that is much too large. The value\nof \u03bc induced in this way also need not have any special relationship to m2Hu , so it does not fix\nthe fine-tuning problem in complete generality. On the other hand, for gravity mediation,\ni.e. one-scale SUSY breaking without any knowledge about Standard Model charges, the\nGiudice-Masiero mechanism works fine.\nAnother way to simultaneously address both the fine-tuning problem and the \u03bc-problem\nis to add a gauge singlet chiral superfield S to the MSSM [157]. With a singlet, the MSSM\n\u03bc-term superpotential operator can be replaced by\nW \u2283 \u03bb S Hu *Hd .\n\n(40)\n\nThis leads to an effective \u03bc-term when the scalar component of S develops a vacuum expectation value \u03bceff = \u03bb hSi. Such a VEV is induced naturally by supersymmetry breaking,\nthereby linking the value of the effective \u03bc-term to the soft breaking mass scale and giving\na simple solution to the MSSM \u03bc-problem. Even better, there is a new superpotential contribution to the tree-level CP-even Higgs mass, and the lower bound of Eq. (36) is increased\nto [157]\nm2h \u2265 MZ2 cos2 2\u03b2 + \u03bb2 v 2 sin2 2\u03b2\n(41)\nwhere v ' 174 GeV. For tan \u03b2 \u223c 2 and \u03bb \u223c 1, this easily pushes the tree-level Higgs\nmass above the LEP limit of 114.4 GeV without any need for large stop masses and their\nconsequent fine-tuning.\nThe most popular singlet extension is the next-to-MSSM (NMSSM) [157\u2013159], with the\nHiggs-sector superpotential and the related soft terms\n\u03ba\nWNMSSM \u2283 \u03bb S Hu *Hd + S 3\n3\n\u03ba\n2\n2\n\u2212Lsoft \u2283 mS |S| + (\u03bb A\u03bb S Hu *Hd \u2212 A\u03ba S 3 + h.c.).\n3\n\n(42)\n\nThis theory has a global Z3 symmetry, under which S and all the MSSM chiral superfields\nhave the same charge. It forbids the usual bare \u03bc-term as well as any possible dimensionful\ncouplings involving the singlet S in the supersymmetric Lagrangian. However, if this Z3 is\nexact it will lead to dangerous domain walls in the early universe [160]. These can be avoided\nwith a very small explicit breaking of the symmetry by a singlet tadpole operator [161]. The\ncubic S 3 interaction in Eq. (42) is needed to stabilize the S field at a non-zero VEV. With\none additional singlet superfield, the Higgs boson sector of the NMSSM has one extra CPeven Higgs and one extra CP-odd Higgs compared to the MSSM, while the singlino fermion\ncomponent of the singlet gives rise to a fifth neutralino state.\nCollider signals of the NMSSM depend primarily on the amount of mixing between the\nMSSM states and the singlets [158]. They become identical to the usual MSSM signals in\n32\n\n\fthe limit of \u03bb \u2192 0 and hSi \u2192 \u221e with \u03bceff = \u03bbhSi held fixed. In this limit the singlet states\ndecouple completely from the rest of the theory. On the other hand, when \u03bb is of order unity\nand \u03bceff is not too large, there can be significant mixing between the singlet and charged\nstates.\nAn especially interesting example of this mixing arises when the singlet sector has an\napproximate global symmetry that produces a light pseudoscalar. Two promising candidates\nare a U (1)R symmetry when A\u03bb , A\u03ba \u2192 0 [162], and a U (1)PQ symmetry for \u03ba, A\u03ba \u2192 0 [163].\nIf either of these holds approximately, they will be broken spontaneously when S, Hu , and\nHd develop VEVs giving rise to an approximate Nambu-Goldstone boson [162, 163]. This\nstate takes the form of a light, mostly singlet CP-odd Higgs a0 in the spectrum, and can\neasily be lighter than half the mass of the lightest SM-like CP-even Higgs h0 . This way the\nHiggs decay mode h0 \u2192 a0 a0 can become dominant, beating out the usual h0 \u2192 bb\u0304 channel\nfor mh . 130 GeV [164, 165]. The light pseudoscalar a0 inherits couplings to the Standard\nModel from its mixing with the heavier non-singlet CP-odd Higgs, and decays primarily\nthrough a0 \u2192 bb\u0304 for ma & 10 GeV and a0 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4\u0304 for 3 GeV . ma . 10 GeV. Generically,\nthis leads to four-body Higgs decays producing 4b, 4\u03c4 , or 2b2\u03c4 and even lighter final states.\nEven more unusual decay modes can arise going beyond the NMSSM [166].\nThese non-standard decays of the otherwise SM-like h0 Higgs can significantly weaken\nthe LEP limits on this state [164\u2013167]. When the h0 \u2192 a0 a0 decay mode is dominant, the\nLEP bound can be as low as mh & 107 GeV for a0 \u2192 bb\u0304 primarily, and mh & 86 GeV when\na0 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4\u0304 is dominant [168]. The weaker bounds reflect that such decays are generically harder\nto extract due to the higher multiplicity and softer energy spectrum of the decay products,\nbut they are also due in part to the fact that the original analyses were optimized for other\nsignatures. A good example is the 4b Higgs final state that actually appears in the usual\nh0 \u2192 bb\u0304 search, just with lower efficiency [167]. For the 4\u03c4 channel a preliminary reanalysis\nof ALEPH data suggests that the actual LEP bound might be closer to mh0 & 105 GeV [169].\nThis scenario is also constrained by B-physics [170].\nFor all such exotic Higgs decays there is a model-independent LEP limit of mh & 82 GeV\nthat relies only on the recoiling Z boson in e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Zh, and therefore applies no matter\nhow the h0 decays [171]. Lowering the LEP bound on the h0 Higgs to this value can reduce\nthe fine-tuning in these models to some extent [164, 165, 172, 173]. Most importantly,\nHiggs searches at the LHC are much less sensitive to soft decay products, which means that\nnon-standard multi-body decay modes can seriously complicate the LHC Higgs searches if\ntoo many of the standard discovery channels are suppressed [167, 174]. A promising new\nchannel is the 4b or 4\u03c4 final state with the h0 Higgs produced in association with a W or\nZ [175]. When the 4\u03c4 mode from a0 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4\u0304 is dominant, the h0 Higgs can also be discovered\nat the Tevatron or the LHC through the subleading but clean h0 \u2192 a0 a0 \u2192 2\u03c4 2\u03bc decay\nchannel [176].\nThe NMSSM is only one of many singlet extensions of the MSSM. In the nMSSM (notquite-MSSM or MNSSM), the cubic coupling is replaced by a singlet tadpole [161],\nWnMSSM \u2283 \u03bbS Hu *Hd + tF S ,\n\n(43)\n\nalong with corresponding soft terms. This superpotential, with tF \u223c m2soft , can be motivated\nin supergravity with discrete R-symmetries [161, 177]. It also arises as the low-energy\neffective superpotential in Fat-Higgs scenarios where the singlet and Higgs fields arise as\n33\n\n\fcomposite operators [178\u2013180]. The nMSSM is similar to the NMSSM in its phenomenology,\nbut differs in that it predicts a light mostly-singlet neutralino state whose mass is bounded\nabove by [181, 182]\n\u03bb2 v 2 (m2Z c22\u03b2 + \u03bb2 v 2 s22\u03b2 )\n2\nm\u03c7\u03030 .\n(44)\n1\n|\u03bceff |2 + \u03bb2 v 2 (1 + s22\u03b2 ) + m2Z c22\u03b2\nFor larger \u03bb, the SM-like h0 Higgs can decay predominantly into pairs of these neutralinos\nproducing invisible Higgs decays [181, 183].\nBesides the nMSSM, there are many possible multi-singlet MSSM extensions [184]. In\nnearly all such extensions, the effect of the coupling of Eq. (40) on raising the h0 Higgs\nmass is strongly limited if we require perturbative gauge unification. To maintain \u03bb(Q)\nperturbatively small up to the unification scale, its low-energy value\n\u221a must lie below \u03bb(mW ) .\n0.7 [185]. In the NMSSM, the corresponding limit is roughly \u03bb2 + \u03ba2 . 0.7 [157]. The\nnMSSM thus allows a maximal value of \u03bb since effectively \u03ba \u2192 0. Fat Higgs models allow\nfor even larger values by interpreting the Landau pole in \u03bb as the compositeness scale. This\nbound can also be relaxed by extending the gauge structure of the theory to include new\nnon-Abelian gauge symmetries that modify the running of \u03bb [186], allowing the SM-like\nHiggs boson to be heavier than 200 GeV without the need for heavy stops.\nThe new singlet S introduced in the NMSSM and its brethren can be problematic unless it\nis charged under some symmetry: global or local, discrete or continuous [187]. Instead of the\napproximate Z3 of the NMSSM, an attractive alternative is to introduce a new U (1)x gauge\nsymmetry under which S is charged [184]. To forbid a bare \u03bc term and at the same time allow\nfor the VEV-based superpotential term of Eq. (40), the Standard Model fields must also be\ncharged under U (1)x . Having done this, there is no need for other superpotential terms\ninvolving S since the U (1)x D-term potential generates a stabilizing quartic |S|4 coupling:\n\u00012\ngx2\nxS |S|2 + xHu |Hu |2 + xHd |Hd |2 + . . . ,\n(45)\n2\nwhere xi are U (1)x charges. This D-term potential also increases the theoretical tree-level\nupper bound on the h0 mass to\n\u00012\n(46)\nm2h \u2264 MZ2 cos2 2\u03b2 + \u03bb2 v 2 sin2 2\u03b2 + 2 gx2 v 2 xHU cos2 \u03b2 + xHd sin2 \u03b2\nVDx =\n\nAs in the NMSSM, the Higgs sector of these theories contains an additional CP-even and\nCP-odd Higgs relative to the MSSM, as well as at least one new neutralino derived from\nthe fermion part of S. Such new states can modify the Higgs and supersymmetry signals at\nthe LHC. In addition, there can be new supersymmetric signals from the massive Zx gauge\nboson [188].\nFor these U (1)x extensions to be self-consistent and phenomenologically acceptable, the\nU (1)x charges xi of S and the MSSM fields must typically satisfy anomaly cancellation conditions, they should be the same for all three generations to avoid flavor violation, and they\nshould allow the usual MSSM superpotential interactions. (However, see Refs. [189] for specific counterexamples.) These requirements, together with the assumption that xS 6= 0 can\nbe shown to imply that the theory must also contain new exotic color-charged states [190].\nSuch states can be vector-like in their Standard Model charges but must be chiral under U (1)x to avoid re-introducing a \u03bc-problem. For example, these states could include\nDc = (3\u0304, 1, 1/3, xDc ) and D = (3, 1, \u22121/3, xD ) under SU (3)c \u00d7 SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y \u00d7 U (1)x . If\n(xS + xD + xDc ) = 0, the exotics states can get a mass from the superpotential coupling\nW \u2283 \u03beD S D Dc .\n34\n\n(47)\n\n\fSuch states are frequently long-lived, often decaying to the MSSM only through higherdimensional operators, and can produce massive charged tracks at the LHC [191].\nThe case of U (1)x is a representative example of D-term contributions to the Higgs mass.\nMore complicated structures involving non-Abelian gauge groups are also possible, and can\nresult in much heavier Higgs bosons while remaining consistent with perturbative unification\nprovided the new gauge interactions are asymptotically free [186, 192].\nThe specific extensions of the MSSM Higgs sector described above are only a small subset of a vast range of possibilities. If the new states modifying the Higgs sector are somewhat heavier than their MSSM counterparts, they can can be integrated out leaving behind\nan effective theory consisting of the minimal MSSM Higgs sector augmented by higherdimensional operators. The strategy of Refs. [193] is to study the effects of such operators\nwithout specifying where they come from. For example, the superpotential operator\nZ\n\u03b6\nW \u2283 d2 \u03b8 (Hu *Hd )2\n(48)\nM\nmodifies the Higgs potential according to [193]\n\u0010\n\u0011\n2\u03b6\u03bc\u2217\n\u2020\n\u2020\nHu *Hd Hu Hu + Hd Hd + h.c.\n\u2206V =\nM\n\n(49)\n\nwhere \u03bc is the usual MSSM \u03bc-term. With supersymmetry breaking, there can arise an\nadditional related correction to the Higgs potential of the form [193]\n\u2206V =\n\n\u03bb msoft\n(Hu *Hd )2 + h.c.\nM\n\n(50)\n\nwhere msoft is on the order of the soft SUSY breaking terms. These corrections can significantly increase the mass of the lightest SM-like Higgs boson provided the ratio of Hu and Hd\nVEVs tan \u03b2 is not too large and M/\u03b6 is less than a few TeV. Again, this eliminates the need\nfor heavy stops and their associated fine-tuning to push up the Higgs mass. The operator of\nEq. (48) also alters the Higgs-higgsino couplings and can modify the branching fractions of\nthe heavy Higgses H 0 , A0 , and H \u00b1 . It can also be a source of CP violation [194], as well as\ninduce a new electroweak symmetry breaking minimum that persists in the supersymmetric\nlimit msoft \u2192 0 [195].\nExtensions of the MSSM Higgs sector can also contain new states that are not singlets\nunder the Standard Model. In general, we can add any number of doublets and singlets or\nhigher representations to the Higgs sector provided they do not generate gauge anomalies\nor ruin the prediction for electroweak observables. While such models do not necessarily\nhave a strong theory motivation, they can receive experimental motivation from the LEP2\nresults in the four-jet channel or simply to challenge the LHC analysis setup such as the\nso-called stealth models [196, 197] and beyond [198]. These models can contain multiple\nHiggs resonances or even a near continuum.\nOne strategy to search for such objects is to choose the LHC Higgs discovery channel\nbest suited for a Higgs mass reconstruction and simply try resolve the resonant structures.\nFor example, regular weak-boson-fusion production with a collinear m\u03c4 \u03c4 reconstruction [199]\ncan resolve two Higgs resonances separated by O(15 GeV) [200]. Much better resolution is\navailable from the h \u2192 ZZ \u2192 4` provided it has a reasonable rate. An orthogonal approach\n35\n\n\fstarts from a Higgs channel which only very approximately reconstructs the Higgs resonance,\nfor example as a wide W W transverse mass [201, 202], as described in Section III B. As a\nproduction process we can either choose gluon fusion or weak boson fusion, but depending\non the models considered weak boson fusion might be more stable with respect to model\nvariations, it has a wider reach in Higgs masses, and it has a generically better signal-tobackground ratio of order one. Changing the shape of a Higgs 'resonance' from a single mass\npeak to many mass peaks or even a continuum will now affect the shape of the transverse\nW W mass reconstruction [203] and allows us to extract the structure of the Higgs sector by\nan appropriate numerical fit to the mT,W W shape.\nBesides modifying the Higgs sector of the MSSM, there are many other well-motivated\nextensions of other parts of the theory. A simple example that also has important implications for the Higgs sector is the inclusion of a (supersymmetric) fourth generation of quarks\nand leptons. This possibility can be consistent with precision electroweak bounds provided\nthere is a moderate mass splitting between the new up- and down-type quarks and leptons [204]. Current Tevatron bounds imply that the new quarks must be heavier than about\n300 GeV, forcing their Yukawa couplings to the Higgs field to be considerably larger than\nunity [205]. This helps to push up the mass of the lightest CP-even Higgs boson, allowing\nmh0 > 114.4 GeV with superpartner masses near 300 GeV and fixing the Higgs fine-tuning\nproblem of the MSSM [206, 207]. A fourth supersymmetric generation will give rise to highly\nvisible signals at the LHC, although the details depend on the mass spectrum [206]. The\nfourth-generation quarks will also induce significant changes to the production and decay\nproperties of the h0 Higgs boson [204, 206].\nDespite these attractive features, the large fourth-generation Yukawa couplings lead to a\nbreakdown of perturbation theory near 10 TeV unless new states enter below that scale to\nmoderate their running [206, 208]. A simple alternative is to augment the MSSM with new\nsupersymmetric vector-like quarks and leptons that have direct masses as well as Yukawa\ncouplings to the Higgses [209]. Such extensions can also repair the Higgs fine-tuning problem\nof the MSSM while still allowing perturbative unification.\nA more radical modification of the MSSM is to elevate R-parity to a continuous global\nU (1)R symmetry [210, 211]. Such a symmetry arises naturally when supersymmetry is\nunbroken. The R-charge of a supermultiplet is usually specified by that of its lowest-spin\ncomponent, with the charges of the higher components given by R = [R0 \u2212 2(s \u2212 s0 )], where\nR0 is the charge of the lowest-spin component and s0 is its spin. Using the rules for deriving\ncouplings from the superpotential given in Section II A 1, it is not hard to check that the\ntotal R-charge of any term in the superpotential must be equal to +2 if the Lagrangian of\nthe theory is to be invariant under U (1)R transformations [39]. The gaugino in a vector\nmultiplet must also have R = 1 to allow a standard vector boson kinetic term [39]. Without\nsoft supersymmetry breaking, the MSSM is symmetric under a U (1)R where Hu and Hd have\nR = 1 and the rest of the chiral superfields all have R = 1/2. This symmetry is explicitly\nbroken by the soft Majorana masses for the gauginos and the soft trilinear A-terms, and\nspontaneously broken by the Higgs VEVs.\nTo extend the MSSM to include an unbroken R-symmetry, a new source of gaugino soft\nmasses is required. These can arise in an R-symmetric way when adjoint chiral multiplets \u03a6i\nwith R = 0 are introduced for each gauge group. Together with supersymmetry breaking,\nthis allows soft Dirac gaugino masses [212, 213]\n\u2212 L \u2283 mi \u03bbi \u03c8i ,\n36\n\n(51)\n\n\f10 3\n10\n\n\u2013\n\n\u03c3tot (pp/pp\u2192GG/G+X) [pb]\n\n2\n\nno cuts, no decay\n\nLHCpairs\n\n10\n1\n10\n10\n10\n10\n\n-1\n-2\n\nLHCsingle\n\n-3\n-4\n\n200\n\nTevatron\n300\n\n500\n\n700\n\n1000\n\n2000\nmG[GeV]\n\nFIG. 6: Production rates for sgluons at the Tevatron and at the LHC. For the LHC we show pair\nproduction (solid) and single production (dashed) as a function of the sgluon mass. The two curves\nfor single sgluon production assume a gluino mass of 1 TeV and squark masses of 500 GeV (upper\ncurve) and 1 TeV (lower curve). Figure from Ref. [215]\n\nwhere \u03bbi is the gaugino of the i-th gauge group and \u03c8i is the fermion component of the adjoint\n\u03a6i . This form of gaugino masses arises naturally in theories with an enhanced number of\nsupersymmetries (N = 2) [212]. To avoid spontaneously breaking the U (1)R , the Higgs\nmultiplets Hu and Hd must both have R = 0. All the usual Yukawa couplings will then\nbe allowed provided the matter fields all have R = 1. This charge assignment forbids the\nsuperpotential \u03bc-term, leaving the Higgsinos unacceptably light. To fix this, it is necessary\nto add two new R = 2 chiral multiplets Ru and Rd with the same quantum numbers as\nHd and Hu respectively. With these fields, new R-symmetric contributions to the higgsino\nmasses arise from the superpotential couplings [211]\nX\n\u0001\nW \u2283 \u03bcu Ru *Hu + \u03bcd Rd *Hd +\n\u03beui Hu \u03a6i Ru + \u03bedi Hd \u03a6i Rd .\n(52)\ni=1,2\n\nTogether, these fields make up the minimal R-symmetric supersymmetric extension of the\nStandard Model (MRSSM) [211].\nThe collider signals of the MRSSM are similar to those of the MSSM, but with a few\nimportant differences. Relative to the MSSM, the MRSSM can accommodate a much larger\namount of flavor mixing while remaining consistent with experimental bounds [211]. This\narises primarily for two reasons: the absence of Majorana gaugino masses and trilinear Aterms forbids most dimension-five flavor mixing operators; and the Dirac gaugino masses\ncan be naturally much larger than the sfermion masses leading to an additional suppression\nby factors of mf \u0303/mg\u0303 \u001c 1 [211]. Large amounts of flavor mixing can generate new collider\nsignals, such as single-top plus missing energy through the flavor-violating decays \u0169 \u2192 \u03c7\u030301 t\nand d \u0303 \u2192 \u03c7\u0303\u2212\n1 t [214]. The MRSSM also accommodates a chargino NLSP and a gravitino LSP\nin the context of gauge mediation much more readily than the MSSM, allowing displaced\ncharged tracks [135].\nIndependent of the details of the comparably messy weak sector, an enhanced (N = 2)\nsupersymmetry or a Dirac gaugino mass requires the introduction of an additional strongly\n37\n\n\finteracting complex scalar field \u03a63 , or sgluon G. At the LHC, this new particle will dominate\nthe phenomenology, owing to its QCD-sized gGG coupling. The primary question is whether\nsgluons are dominantly pair-produced through their tree-level color charge or singly produced\nvia a loop-induced coupling to quarks. With a flavor diagonal squark sector, the light sgluon\ndecays to either two gluons, two light quarks, or two tops, all at one-loop order [215, 216].\nBecause of the scaling of this effective operator, a heavy sgluon will prefer the gluon decay\nchannel. On the other hand, once the main flavor constraints in the MSSM have vanished,\nthere is no reason to expect the squark sector to be flavor diagonal. In that case the sgluon\nwill decay to a single-top final state tq. From sgluon pair production the most striking\nsignature would then be like-sign top\u2013top production [215].\nA further possibility is that the MSSM couples to a new gauged hidden sector with a\ncharacteristic mass scale below a GeV [217]. Models of this type have received attention\nrecently in relation to potential hints of dark matter, but they are also interesting in their\nown right since they can produce unusual signals at particle colliders [217]. The simplest\nsupersymmetric example consists of an Abelian U (1)x gauge multiplet together with hidden\nHiggs fields H and H 0 and the superpotential [218]\nWhid = \u03bc0 HH 0 .\n\n(53)\n\nThese hidden Higgses are assumed to develop vacuum expectation values on the order of\na GeV. The hidden sector can connect very weakly to the MSSM through gauge-kinetic\nmixing with hypercharge of the form [219]\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u2020 \u03bc\nL \u2283 \u000f \u2212 X\u03bc\u03bd B + iX\u0303 \u03c3\u0304 \u2202\u03bc B\u0303 + h.c. ,\n(54)\n2\nwhere X\u03bc\u03bd is the hidden U (1)x gauge field strength and X\u0303 is the hidden gaugino. A value\nof \u000f \u223c 10\u22124\u221210\u22122 is generated naturally by integrating out heavy states charged under both\nU (1)x and U (1)Y [220]. The first mixing term in Eq. (54) induces a coupling between the\nhidden massive Zx gauge boson and the MSSM states. If the Zx boson is unable to decay\nto other states in the hidden sector due to kinematics, it will decay back to the Standard\nModel with width proportional to \u000f2 . Existing searches for light physics limit \u000f . 10\u22123 for\nmZx \u223c 1 GeV when such decays dominate. The second term in Eq. (54) leads to superpartner\ndecays from the MSSM to the hidden sector of the form B\u0303 \u2192 H H\u0303 [221].\nA light hidden sector of this form can produce striking signals at the LHC [217]. These\noriginate primarily from supersymmetric MSSM cascade decays. Instead of terminating at\nthe lightest MSSM superpartner, these cascades will continue into the hidden sector. For\nexample, \u03c7\u030301 \u2192 \u03c7\u0303hid hhid , where \u03c7\u0303hid is a hidden sector neutralino and hhid a hidden Higgs.\nThe cascade will continue in the hidden sector until the lightest superpartner is reached. If\nthese produce one or more Zx gauge bosons, a distinctive signature will arise from decays\nof the Zx to Standard Model leptons. Such lepton pairs will typically have a small invariant\nmass on account of their origin, but they will also be highly collimated since their energy\nscale is set by the mass of the much heavier MSSM states [221, 222].\nB.\n\nExtra dimensions\n\nHaving discussed supersymmetric models, we turn next to models with extra spacetime\ndimensions [14, 223]. There exists a wide range of such models, and we can categorize them in\n38\n\n\fa broad way. To have avoided detection, the extra dimension(s) should typically be compact,\nhaving a finite extent. Very small extra dimensions arise frequently in string theory but are\ndifficult to probe experimentally. In most cases only extra dimensions with a characteristic\nscale around the TeV scale can be observed at the LHC, and we will concentrate primarily\non these. Next, extra dimensions can be flat and separable, as discussed in this section, or\ninvolve a warped extra-dimensional metric like the RS models discussed in Section II E 1.\nLast, the extra dimensions can be accessible to gravity only, like the ADD models discussed\nin Section II B 1, or incorporate Standard Model fields within the additional dimensions,\nlike the universal extra dimensions introduced in Section II B 2. All of these models offer\ndistinct solutions to various challenges facing the Standard Model, and they predict a broad\nclass of signatures at colliders. Some of the more specific LHC aspects will be discussed in\nSection III.\n1.\n\nLarge extra dimensions\n\nLarge extra dimensions, also known as ADD models, aim to solve the hierarchy problem\nof the Standard Model with a minimal change to its particle content [224]. They consist of\n(4 + n) spacetime dimensions, with the n additional dimensions all being compact but with\nsome of them having a relatively large (but microscopic) characteristic radius. The Standard\nModel is confined to a four-dimensional subsurface of this space called a brane. Gravity\npropagates in all dimensions, and has a characteristic higher-dimensional scale M\u2217 \u223c TeV\nmarking the onset of quantum gravitational effects and the end of the Standard Model\ndescription. However, the effective strength of gravity acting on the Standard Model is\nreduced to MPl due to a dilution by the volume of the extra dimensions. This setup explains\nthe observed hierarchy between the electroweak scale and the perceived Planck [224] (or\nGUT [225]) scale to the extent that the size of the extra dimensions is stabilized.\nAt the classical level, extra-dimensional gravity can be described by the Einstein-Hilbert\naction. This presents a number of basic features, and the propagating degrees of freedom\narise through the symmetric and dimensionless metric gM N . The mass dimension of the\nRicci scalar is independent of the underlying space-time dimension since this is determined\nby derivatives. ADD models also make a number of further specific assumptions about the\nbackground metric of the (4 + n) dimensional space:\n\u2013 spatial : the n extra dimensions are all spatial with signature (\u22121, \u22121, * * * ).\n\u2013 separable: the metric decomposes as a product space g (4+n) = g (4) \u2297 g (n) .\n\u2013 flat: matter is restricted to a four-dimensional brane with the energy-momentum\ntensor\n\u0012\n\u0013\nT\u03bc\u03bd (x) \u03b4 (n) (y) 0\n\u03bc \u03bd\n(n)\nTAB (x; y) = \u03b7A \u03b7B T\u03bc\u03bd (x) \u03b4 (y) =\n.\n(55)\n0\n0\nThe assumption of an infinitely thin brane for our 4-dimensional world might have to\nbe weakened to generate realistic higher-dimensional operators for flavor physics or\nproton decay [226]. Alternatively, we can avoid those experimental constraints using\na discrete symmetry [227].\n\u2013 compact/periodic: the extra dimensions are compact, and we will assume here that\nthey are simply periodic.\n39\n\n\fWe can then generalize the Einstein-Hilbert action to (4 + n) dimensions and match it to\nwhat is seen by a four-dimensional (brane-localized) observer:\nZ\nZ\nq\np\n1 n+2\n1\n2\n4+n\n(4+n)\n\u2212 M?\nd z |g (4+n) | R\n\u2261 \u2212 MPl d4 x \u2212g (4) R(4) ,\n(56)\n2\n2\nwhere the observed Planck scale is given in terms of the fundamental gravity scale M\u2217 and\nthe radius r of the n extra dimensions by\np\n(57)\nMPl = M? (2\u03c0rM? )n/2 = M\u2217 Vn M\u2217n ,\nwhere Vn is the volume of the compact dimensions. (In general, the extra dimensions can\nhave different sizes in which case the second expression should be used.) Assuming M? =\n1 TeV to solve the gauge hierarchy problem, we can transfer the problem into spacetime\ngeometry: r = 10\u22123 \u201310\u221211 m for n = 2\u20136. These dimensions are large in the sense that\nr \u001d M\u2217\u22121 .\nIn the minimal model where the extra dimensions are all periodic with radius r, the\nn = 1 case is ruled out by classical bounds on gravity [228] as well as astrophysical data,\nunless there is and enhanced mass gap between massless and massive excitations [229]. This\nargument is purely classical, and to describe the physical degrees of freedom we resort to\nthe ideas of Kaluza and Klein and map the higher-dimensional gravitational theory onto an\neffective d=4 theory [230].\nThe phenomenology of ADD models rests on the properties of gravitons propagating\nin all dimensions [231, 232]. Generically, a massless graviton in higher dimensions can be\ndescribed by an effective theory of massive gravitons and gauge fields in four dimensions.\nFor such a field the Pauli\u2013Fierz mass term [233] and the coupling to matter fields is highly\nrestricted. In particular, it is inconsistent to introduce massive spin-2 fields not originating\nfrom some type of Kaluza\u2013Klein decomposition [234]. In terms of the graviton field gAB =\n1+n/2\n\u03b7AB + 2hAB /M?\nthe linearized Einstein\u2013Hilbert action leads to\n1\n1\n\u2212(1+n/2) M N\nL = \u2212 hM N \u0003hM N + h\u0003h \u2212 hM N \u2202M \u2202N h + hM N \u2202M \u2202L hN\nh TM N ,\nL \u2212 M?\n2\n2\n\n(58)\n\nPeriodic boundary conditions allow us to Fourier decompose the (4+n)-dimensional graviton\n(~\nn)\nfield into a tower of four-dimensional real bosonic Kaluza-Klein modes hAB (x) with mass\ndimension one. Since these modes do not transform irreducibly under the Lorentz group\nin four dimensions, we further decompose them into a set irreducible representations that\nincludes the four-dimensional massive graviton [231]. In the original Kaluza\u2013Klein [230]\ndecomposition a 5-dimensional metric gAB is decomposed into a four-dimensional metric\ng\u03bc\u03bd , a vector A\u03bc and a scalar \u03c6. Including KK masses, the vector and scalar fields are eaten\nby the graviton to build a massive 4-dimensional graviton with five degrees of freedom.\nn\nSimilarly, we define G~\u03bc\u03bd\nas a massive graviton field. However, this does not exhaust the\ndegrees of freedom; there is an additional massive (n \u2212 1)-multiplet of vectors, (n2 \u2212 n \u2212 2)/2\n\n40\n\n\fscalars and an additional singlet scalar. In terms of these fields the Einstein equations are\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u03bb\u0015\n\u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03bd\nT\u03bb\nT \u03bc\u03bd\n1\n2\n(~\nn)\n\u2212T\u03bc\u03bd +\n+\n\u03b7\n=\n\u2212\n(\u0003 + mKK )G\u03bc\u03bd =\n\u03bc\u03bd\nMPl\nm2KK\n3\nMPl\n(~\nn)\n\n(\u0003 + m2KK )V\u03bcj = 0\n(~\nn)\n\n(\u0003 + m2KK )Sjk = 0\np\n3(n \u2212 1)/(n + 2) \u03bc\n(\u0003 + m2KK )H (~n) =\nT\u03bc .\n3MPl\n\n(59)\n\nAt the LHC the most relevant couplings are to effectively massless degrees of freedom.\nThe physical graviton couplings are then degenerate and individually suppressed by the\nfour-dimensional Planck mass 1/MPl . The fields V\u03bcj and Sjk do not couple to the energy\nmomentum tensor, i.e. to the Standard Model. The massless radion H corresponds to a\nvolume fluctuation of the compactified extra dimension. We assume that the compactification radius r is stabilized in some way [235], giving it mass [236]. Such a radion couples\nproportionally to masses, so as a scalar with no Standard Model charge it will mix with a\nHiggs boson without overly drastic effects.\nThe mass splitting between the KK states inside the tower is given by 1/r, which translates into (M? = 1 TeV):\n\uf8f1\n\u0012\n\u00132/n \uf8f2 0.003 eV (n = 2)\n1\nM?\n\u03b4mKK \u223c = 2\u03c0M?\n(60)\n= 0.1 MeV (n = 4)\n\uf8f3\nr\nMPl\n0.05 GeV (n = 6)\nThese mass splittings are too small for the LHC to resolve.\nADD models are constrained by a number of different ways including electroweak precision data [237] and astrophysical observations [238], in part orthogonal to their collider effects [229]. Current limits strongly constrain ADD models with n \u2264 2. For two to seven extra\ndimensions, strong direct constraints on M? come from the Tevatron experiments [239, 240].\nWe can probe ADD models at colliders by searching for virtual graviton exchange as\nwell as real graviton emission in high-energy reactions. An emitted tower of KK gravitons\nappears as missing transverse momentum, for example in association with single jet production [231, 241, 242]. Similarly, hard single photon events with missing energy (monophotons)\nwould constitute a striking signature for physics beyond the Standard Model. The Drell\u2013\nYan process q q\u0304 \u2192 \u03b3 \u2217 , Z \u2192 `+ `\u2212 is arguably the best known hadron collider process. A large\namount of missing energy in this channel would be a particularly clean signal for physics\nbeyond the Standard Model [243]. Depending on the detailed analysis, both of these electroweak signatures do have smaller rates than a jet+graviton final state, but the lack of\nQCD backgrounds and QCD-sized experimental and theory uncertainties result in a similar\ndiscovery potential [231, 241].\nIn computing the collider signals of ADD models it is essential to sum over the production\nor exchange of all the graviton modes. Since the modes are closely spaced, these sums can\nbe approximated reliably by an integral over an n-dimensional sphere in KK density space\nwith measure\n\u0012\n\u00132\nn\u22121\nMPl\ntower\ngraviton Sn\u22121 mKK dmKK\nd\u03c3\n= d\u03c3\n.\n(61)\n(2\u03c0M? )n\nM?\n41\n\n\f+\u2212\n\n5\u03c3: pp \u2192 l l (D8)\n\nMD[TeV]\n10\n8\n\n-1\n\n100 fb\n-1\n10 fb\n\n\u03b4=6\n\u03b4=4\n\n6\n\n\u03b4=3\n\u03b4=2\n\n4\n\n\u03b4=1\n\n2\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\u039b[TeV]\n\nFIG. 7: 5\u03c3 discovery contours for discovery of extra dimensions via virtual graviton contributions\nto the Drell\u2013Yan process. Figure from Ref.[229].\n2\nwith Sn\u22121 = 2\u03c0 n/2 /\u0393(n/2). The factor MPl\nfrom the KK tower summation defines a KK\ntower effective coupling E/M? instead of E/MPl , roughly of the same size as the Standard\nModel gauge couplings. For larger n, the integral over mKK is ultraviolet-dominated. This\nresults from the KK modes becoming more tightly spaced as we move to higher masses, and\neven more so for an increasing number of extra dimensions n. If we assign a cutoff \u039bcutoff\nto the mKK integration in Eq. (61), the integral scales at the partonic level like \u039bncutoff . In\nother words, our effective theory of KK gravity crucially requires a cutoff to regularize an\nultraviolet divergence, reflecting the fact that gravity is not perturbatively renormalizable.\nThe major question is then whether LHC observables are\u221asensitive to \u039bcutoff . Luckily, for\nreal graviton production the kinematic constraint mKK < s provides a natural ultraviolet\ncutoff, implying that the cross section prediction is insensitive to physics far above the LHC\nenergy scale, which might or might not cover the fundamental Planck scale.\n\nAs a second collider signature, virtual gravitons exchanged in the s-channel generate the\ndimension-8 operator\n1 X\n1\nT\u03bc\u03bd T \u03bc\u03bd \u2261 S(s) T .\n(62)\n2\nMPl\ns \u2212 m2KK\nSimilarly, a loop-induced dimension-6 operator will couple two axial-vector currents. and\ncan be estimated by naive dimensional analysis [244].\nIn the Standard Model, leptons and weak gauge bosons can only be produced by a q q\u0304\ninitial state. Because at LHC energies the protons mostly consist of gluons, indirect graviton\nchannels with these final states get a head start. The Tevatron mostly looks for new physics\nof this type in two-photon or two-electron final states [240]. At the LHC, the cleanest\nsignal taking into account backgrounds as well as experimental complications is a pair of\nmuons [245]. Aside from the squared amplitude for graviton production, Standard Model\nDrell-Yan amplitudes interfere with the graviton amplitude, affecting the total rate as well\nas kinematic distributions. This mix of squared amplitudes and interference effects make it\nhard to apply any kind of golden cut to cleanly separate signal and background. One useful\nproperty of the s-channel process is that the final state particles decay from a pure d-wave\n(spin-2) state. This results in a distinctive angular separation of the final state muons [245].\n42\n\n\fAt this stage we are most interested in the derivation of the dimension-8 operator S from\nthe KK effective theory. Its dimension 1/m4 coefficient arises partly from the coupling and\npartly from the propagator structure. In a similar vein to the real emission case, we can\nreplace MPl with its definition in terms of M? . The factor of rn appearing in the denominator\nis precisely (\u2206mKK )2 , giving us a (radial) integral over KK masses. Again, the result is UV\ndivergent for n > 1. In the spirit of an effective theory we study the leading terms in s/\u039b2cutoff\nSn\u22121\nS(s) = 4\nM?

Obviously,\nthis relation should be considered an order-of-magnitude estimate rather than an exact\nrelation valid. For simplicity this term can further be approximated in terms of a generic\nmass scale S = 4\u03c0/M 4 [231, 244], assuming (or hoping) that the effective KK theory captures\nthe dominant effects. The function S(s) including \u039bcutoff can be integrated analytically for\na Wick rotated graviton propagator 1/(s + m2KK ), but the interpretation of particles in an\neffective field theory will be lost beyond a leading approximation s \u001d m2KK or s \u001c m2KK .\nThe LHC reach in M? \u2261 MD is given in Fig.7, again in the presence of a variable cutoff\n\u039bcutoff . As opposed to the real emission case shown in Fig.\nresult is clearly sensitive\nR \u221e33, the \u22122\nto \u039bcutoff . Only for n = 1 is this not true, reflecting that 0 dm mKK in fact converges.\nAs explicitly seen above, the effective field theory description of extra-dimensional gravity\nbreaks down once the LHC energy approaches the fundamental Planck scale, no matter if\nwe study real or virtual gravitons. Once this ratio of the typical energy over the Planck scale\nbecomes large, gravity appears to become strongly interacting and we expect to encounter\nultraviolet physics. There are a number of effective-theory proposals which side-step this\ncomplication by defining the integral in a cutoff-independent scheme. One such treatment\nrelates to the eikonal approximation to the 2 \u2192 2 process [246], another involves introducing\na finite brane thickness [247]. In the latter, the gravitational coupling is exponentially\nsuppressed above M? by a brane rebound effect. This is applied to the case of high energy\ncosmic rays interacting via KK graviton exchange [248]. However, none of these models offer\na compelling UV completion for the KK effective theory.\nAt a conceptual level this potential breakdown of the KK effective theory at LHC energies insinuates the immediate need for a more complete description of gravity. We know\nseveral possible modifications of this dangerous ultraviolet behavior [249]: most well known,\nstring theory includes its own fundamental scale MS which is related to a finite size of its\nunderlying objects. Such a minimum length acts as a an ultraviolet cutoff in the energy,\nwhich regularizes all observables described by the gravitational interaction [250, 251]. An alternative approach which avoids any ad-hoc introduction of radically different physics above\nsome energy scale is based on the ultraviolet behavior of gravity itself [252]: the asymptotic safety scenario is based on the observation that the gravitational coupling develops an\nultraviolet fixed point which avoids the ultraviolet divergences naively derived from power\ncounting [253\u2013257]. This idea can be applied to LHC phenomenology in ADD [258] or\nRandall-Sundrum [259] models.\nFor example, the scattering process q q\u0304 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 can be computed using open string\nperturbation theory. The helicity amplitudes for 2 \u2192 2 scattering are simply analytic\n\n43\n\n\ffunctions in s, t and u together with the common Veneziano amplitude [250]\nS(s, t) =\n\n\u0393(1 \u2212 s/MS2 ) \u0393(1 \u2212 t/MS2 )\n\u0393(1 \u2212 (s + t)/MS2 )\n\n(64)\n\nin terms of the inverse string scale MS . While we do not exactly know the size of this scale it\nshould lie between the weak scale and the fundamental Planck scale M? . We consider three\ndistinct limits: first, the leading correction below the string scale is S = (1 \u2212 \u03c0 2 /6 st/MS4 ).\nThis form corresponds to our KK effective field theory, modulo a normalization factor which\nrelates the MS and MPl . Going back to Eq. (63) we find that the dimension-8 operator in\nterms of the string scale is given by \u03c0 2 /32 \u00d7 g 4 /MS4 . While this series in MS is not what\nwe are interested in as the UV completion of our theory, it is the reason why we expect\nstring excitations to be the dominant process for high energy particle scattering. Next, in\nthe hard scattering limit s \u2192 \u221e and for a fixed scattering angle the amplitude behaves as\nS \u223c exp \u2212\u03b10 (s log s+t log t). Due to the finite string scale all scattering amplitudes becomes\nweak in the UV. Unfortunately, this limit is not very useful for LHC phenomenology. Last\nbut not least, in the Regge limit for small angle high energy scattering s \u001d t the poles\u221ain the\n\u0393 functions determine the structure. They describe string resonances with masses nMS .\nThe physical behavior for scattering amplitudes above the string scale is a combination\nof Regge and hard scattering behavior. In other words, equally spaced string resonances\ntogether alongside exponential suppression, but at colliders the resonances should be the\nmost visible effects.\nAside from these gauge boson string resonances, the string theory equivalent of our process\ngenerating the effective dimension-8 operator is the scattering of four open strings via the\nexchange of a closed string. This amplitude is insignificant compared to the string excitations\nin the vicinity of the string scale. The KK mass integration is finite for all n due to an\nexponential suppression of similar origin as the hard scattering behavior noted above. For\nfields confined to a D3 brane this integral is\nZ\n0\n2\ne\u03b1 (s\u2212m )/2\nS(s) \u223c d6 m\n.\n(65)\ns \u2212 m2\nA similar exponential factor exp(\u2212\u03b10 m2 )/(s \u2212 m2 ) regularizing the m integral appears in\nthe modification using a finite brane thickness [247]. However, this approach still violates\nunitarity for large s.\nThe main issue with the naive phenomenology of RS gravitons described in Section II E 1\nas well as string excitations is that it is no experimental or phenomenological challenge to the\nTevatron or LHC communities. For example the Tevatron experiments have been searching\nfor (and ruling out) heavy gauge bosons for a long time. The discovery of a Z 0 resonance\nat the LHC would simply trigger a discussion of its origin, including KK gravitons, string\nresonances, KK gauge bosons, or simple heavy Z 0 gauge bosons from an additional gauged\nU (1) symmetry [260].\nIn contrast to the common lore there might be no need at all to alter the structure of\ngravity at high energies - gravity can simply be its own ultraviolet completion [252\u2013254].\nAlthough asymptotically safe gravity is developed in four dimensions [255, 257, 261], the\nresults generalize in a straightforward manner [256]. Evidence comes in many forms: the\nconcept of asymptotic safety or non-perturbative renormalizability was proposed originally\nin 1980 [252]. The first hints that gravity might have a UV fixed point were uncovered using a\n44\n\n\f2+\u000f expansion for the space-time dimensionality [262]. Further evidence was collected in the\n1/N expansion where N is the number of matter fields coupled to gravity [253]. More modern\nresults use exact renormalization group methods [254]. There are a number of reviews of\nthe subject [261], and on the necessary non-perturbative techniques, namely the exact flow\nequation for the effective average action or Wetterich equation [263]. Gravitational invariants\nincluding R8 and minimal coupling to matter are consistently included in flow equations\nwithout destroying the fixed point [261]. More recently, it has been shown that including\ninvariants proportional to divergences in perturbation theory do not give divergent results\nnon-perturbatively [264]. Furthermore, there is independent evidence for asymptotic safety\ncoming from recent lattice simulations, causal dynamical triangulations [265]. Universal\nquantities, like e.g. critical exponents, computed using this method agree non-trivially with\nresults derived using renormalization group methods.\nThe key point for our application is that in the UV the coupling exhibits a finite fixed\npoint behavior. This ensures that the UV behavior of the complete theory is dominated\nby fixed point scaling, rendering all our computed transition rates weakly interacting at all\nenergy scales.\nAgain, we start from the Einstein\u2013Hilbert action to calculate the scaling behavior for the\ngravitational coupling. Applying \u03bc d/d\u03bc = d/ log \u03bc we find\n\u03b2g =\n\nd\ng(\u03bc) = [2 + n + \u03b7(g(\u03bc))] g(\u03bc) ,\nd log \u03bc\n\n(66)\n\nThe parameter \u03b7(g) will in general contain contributions from all couplings in the Lagrangian, not only the dimensionless Newton's constant. One important property is immediately apparent: for g = 0 we have a perturbative gaussian fixed point, i.e. an IR fixed\npoint which corresponds to classical general relativity where we have not observed a running gravitational coupling. Secondly, depending on the functional form of \u03b7(g) the prefactor\n2 + n + \u03b7(g) can vanish, giving rise to a a non-gaussian fixed point g? 6= 0. Using the exact\nrenormalization group flow equation we can compute the anomalous dimensions [254], which\ndepend on the shape of the UV regulator. The beta function of the gravitational coupling\nbecomes\n\u03b2g (g) =\n\n(1 \u2212 4(4 + n)g)(2 + n)g\n1 \u2212 (4 + 2n)g\n\n\u03b7(g) =\n\n2(2 + n)(6 + n) g\n2(2 + n) g \u2212 1\n\n(67)\n\nOne way of interpreting the physical effects of the gravitational UV fixed point is to modify the original calculations by defining a running Newton's coupling and evaluate it at\nthe energy scale given by the respective process [259, 266]. The leading effects from the\nrenormalization group running of the gravitational coupling we can now include into a form\nfactor\n\"\n\u0012 2 \u00131+n/2 #\u22121\n1\n1\nF (\u03bc2 ) M N\n1\n\u03bc\nMN\nMN\nh\nT\n\u2192\n1\n+\nh\nT\n\u2261\nh TM N (68)\nM\nN\nM\nN\n8\u03c0g\u2217 M?2\nM?2+n\nM?2+n\nM?2+n\nwhich carries through in the decomposition of hM N to the 4-dimensional field Gn\u03bc\u03bd .

(62) and evaluate the form factor in terms of s, the mKK integration still requires a\ncutoff. On the other hand, as far as the s integration is concerned, the form factor solves\nthe unitarity problem associated with graviton scattering amplitudes at the LHC [259].\nAn alternative method which is better suited for the case of virtual gravitons is based\ndirectly on the form of the anomalous dimension of the graviton Eq. (66) [267]. In this\npicture, there is a phase transition occurring at a critical point with anomalous dimension\n\u03b7? = \u22122 \u2212 n at or beyond the Planck scale. The momentum-space two point function\ngenerically has the form \u2206(p) \u223c 1/(p2 )1\u2212\u03b7/2 , which reproduces the classical result for small\n\u03b7. In the vicinity of the non-gaussian fixed point, this becomes 1/(p2 )\u2212(4+n)/2 [268]. The\nmassive graviton propagator in the fixed point region is then modified as [258]\n1\n\u039b2+n\nT\n\u2192\ns \u2212 m2KK\n(s \u2212 m2KK )(4+n)/2\n\n(69)\n\nwhere the transition scale \u039bT \u223c M? in the numerator maintains the canonical dimensions\nfor the propagator. The graviton kernel S(s) integrated over the entire mKK range is then\nfinite to for all n, and the transition scale \u039bT parameterizes the crossover to fixed point\nscaling.

The\nresult only has a small sensitivity to the transition scale \u039bT \u223c M? , but including a more\nelaborate description of the transition region will remove this. For hadronic cross sections\nthere is still the s integral from the convolution with the parton distribution functions,\nand only to leading-order S is independent of s. For the full S(s) perturbative unitarity is\nguaranteed by its large-s scaling behavior 1/s2 . Most importantly, we do not expect any\n46\n\n\fresonance structure, which makes asymptotic safety clearly distinguishable from a strong\ntheory completion.\nThe UV completion of the KK prediction helps an LHC study in two ways: first of\nall, the signal is enhanced by including the UV portion of the integral. In addition, the\ngraviton kernel has a distinctive shape which depends on the number of extra dimensions\nn. At lower partonic energies, the dominant interference term between gravitons and the\nStandard Model diagrams implies a scaling with S \u223c (n \u2212 1). For higher energies the pure\ngraviton amplitude is dominant and the rate scales as (n \u2212 1)2 . This fact is demonstrated\nin Fig.8.\nIndependent of the UV completion of gravity all of the descriptions above fails once\nthe spatial separation of the two partons colliding at the LHC becomes smaller than the\nSchwarzschild radius of TeV-scale gravity. In this configuration a black hole will form [269],\nmore or less thermalize, and then decay again. Their production cross section is approximately given in terms of the Schwarzschild radius \u03c0rS2 [270]. Highly spherical decays to\nmany particles we can search for and unambiguously identify at the LHC [271], as long as\nthe black hole involves a large number of particles and does not simply appear as a higherdimensional operator [272]. The main question that the UV completion of gravity has to\nanswer is if and how the black hole actually decays, after radiating a sufficient number of\nparticles. Both, string theory and fixed-point gravity indicate that there may be a stable\nremnant delaying the final decay to infinity, which again can be tested in experiment [273].\n2.\n\nUniversal extra dimensions\n\nTheories with Universal Extra Dimensions (UED) also posit additional compact spatial\ndimensions. The distinguishing feature is that all fields live equally in all of the dimensions [58, 225], unlike ADD or RS-like constructions, which confine some or all of the Standard Model to a brane. This simple feature has the consequence that no point is singled out\nprior to compactification, and thus the extra-dimensional Lorentz invariance remains. Some\nof these symmetries are partially broken by the compactification, but remnant symmetries\noften persist. These can ameliorate constraints from precision measurements and predict a\nstable particle which can play the role of dark matter.\nIn contrast to other models involving large extra dimensions, UED theories do not make a\nserious attempt to solve the hierarchy problem, and a compactification radius on the order of\na TeV is typically put in by hand. (However, see Ref. [274] for a topcolor-like construction.)\nInstead, they are motivated for other reasons. Six-dimensional implementations of UED offer\nanomaly cancellation as an explanation for why there are three generations in the Standard\nModel, or more precisely 3n where n is an integer \u2265 0 [275], and can suppress dangerous\noperators leading to rapid proton decay [276]. UED theories also have intrinsic worth as a\nserious model of dark matter [277]. Their SUSY-like spectra and phenomenology of TeVscale KK modes can also serve as a straw-man theory with which we can test our ability to\ndistinguish genuine SUSY signals from similar phenomena arising in other theories [278].\nThe primary characteristics defining a model of UED are the number of compact dimensions, their topology, and their sizes. A five-dimensional theory with one compact dimension\nwith chiral fermions must be compactified into a line segment (orbifold), which is characterized by a single quantity: its length L. Six-dimensional theories with chiral fermions have\n47\n\n\fFIG. 9: Sample spectra in a 5d model (left, from Ref. [282]) under the assumption that boundary\nterms vanish at the cut-off scale. Also shown (right, from Ref. [278]) are typical transitions between\nKK levels, showing the Standard Model particle emitted in a given 2-body decay, for the dominant\ndecays (solid lines) and subdominant decays (dashed lines).\n\nbeen considered with the topology of an orbifolded torus, characterized by two lengths L1\nand L2 , as well as the chiral square, defined as with L1 = L2 = L and its adjacent sides\nidentified [279, 280]. The KK spectrum depends very sensitively on the sizes of the extra\ndimensions according to\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\nj\nk2\n\u03c02 2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nMj,k = \u03c0\n+\nMj = 2 j + m0 (5d)\n+ m20 (6d) ,\n(71)\nL\nL21 L22\nwhere j and k label the mode number(s) and m0 is the corresponding zero mode or Standard\nModel particle mass.\nIn addition to the bulk characteristics, UED theories are characterized by terms which live\non the boundaries of the extra dimensions. The subtle breaking of extra-dimensional Lorentz\ninvariance by the compactification renders such terms inevitable, and they are typically\ndivergent, depending on the unknown UV completion [281]. A popular prescription, termed\nminimal UED, is to choose a scale for the UV completion consistent with a perturbative\nextra-dimensional description up to some scale \u039b, and then assume that in the UV theory\nthe boundary terms vanish at \u039b [282]. Under this assumption, the boundary terms will\nbe generated at the one-loop level proportional to log \u039bL. These terms modify the mass\nspectrum of the KK modes and induce mixing among what would have been the KK states of\nthe theory with zero boundary terms [283]. In analogy to soft SUSY breaking, modifications\nof the UED mass spectrum should be expected to be required by experimental data [284].\nIf these states are induced purely through loops of bulk physics, they will break KK number conservation, but preserve a discrete subgroup called KK parity. The five-dimensional\nmodel has a Z2 symmetry under which (j) states transform as (\u22121)j . The orbifolded torus\ncompactification has a Z2 \u2297Z2 symmetry under which (j, k) states transform as (\u22121)j \u2297(\u22121)k .\nThe chiral square has a Z2 symmetry under which (j, k) states transform as (\u22121)j+k . These\nKK parities are radiatively stable in the sense that provided the initial boundary terms\nrespect them, loops of bulk physics will not destroy them.

[280]) for L = 1/500 GeV, under the assumption that\nboundary terms vanish at the cut-off scale.\n\nboundary terms will break them explicitly, so their existence amounts to an assumption\nabout the UV physics. As in supersymmetric or little Higgs models, such a KK parity\nguarantees that the lightest odd-level KK particle (LKP) is stable, so it can serve as a dark\nmatter agent. At colliders, odd-level KK particles can only be produced in pairs.\nIn Figs. 9 and 10 we show the resulting spectra for the 5d minimal UED model and a\n6d chiral square when the compactification radius is set to L = 1/500 GeV. The spectrum\nof the lightest tier of KK modes is highly reminiscent of a typical supersymmetric theory,\nwith the colored KK particles ending up heaviest, followed by SU (2)L -charged electroweak\nstates in the middle, and only U (1)Y -charged states as the lightest. The identity of the\nLKP determines the features of possible cascade decays. It is remarkable that in both the\n5d model and the chiral square, minimal boundary terms result in a neutral LKP suitable\nas dark matter. In the 5d case the LKP is a vector particle, the first KK mode of the\nU (1)Y gauge boson. On the chiral square it is a combination of the 5 and 6 components\nof the U (1)Y boson, which appear as a Lorentz scalar to an observer in four dimensions.\nNon-minimal boundary terms can lead to different LKPs and spectra, as explored for the\n5d theory in [285, 286].\nThe lightest tier of KK particles is a set of KK-odd states which have cascade decays down\nto the LKP, resulting in missing energy signatures at the LHC. Figure 9 shows the dominant\ncascade decays in the 5d UED model. At the LHC we expect the dominant production\nmodes to be through KK quarks and gluons, because despite being slightly heavier than the\nuncolored states they have large couplings to the initial-state quarks and gluons. Thus, just\nas in supersymmetric theories, a typical UED event produces multiple final state jets and\nleptons [58]. While this is positive in the sense that it means the standard SUSY searches\nwill automatically also apply to large regions of UED parameter space, it raises the question\nas to how well we can distinguish SUSY from UED at the LHC [58, 278, 287].\nThe most obvious distinguishing feature between SUSY and UED is that UED theories\nhave an entire tower of KK excitations, in contrast to the single set of superpartners in SUSY.\nThe discovery of elements of the next higher level (2-modes for 5d theories or (1, 1)-modes\n49\n\n\ffor 6d theories), which we will collectively refer to as level-2 modes from here on, would\nsuggest the extra-dimensional scenario. The level-2 modes are again even under KK parity,\nmeaning that they can be singly produced and decay into pairs of ordinary Standard Model\nfermions - call them yet another reincarnation of a Z 0 boson. The most promising targets\nfor an LHC discovery are indeed the level-2 modes of the charged and neutral electroweak\nbosons. At the parton level we estimate that with 100 fb\u22121 of data, the LHC can discover\nthe \u03b3 (2) and Z (2) neutral bosons decaying into leptons, and reconstruct them as separate\nresonances, provided their masses are less than about 2 TeV [288]. While discovery of the\ntwo level-2 modes would be suggestive, it is not definitive. One can imagine supersymmetric\ntheories with additional U (1) gauge groups with similar phenomenology.\nA second approach is to reconstruct the underlying spins of the first level particles. For\na SUSY theory, these spins will differ from their Standard Model counterparts by 1/2,\nwhereas in UED the spins will be the same as the corresponding Standard Model particle.\nMeasuring spins is a challenge at a hadron collider, particularly because the initial state for\na given event is unknown, and the LKPs or LSPs escape detection and carry spin angular\nmomentum which is thus lost. We will describe techniques to distinguish between different\nspin hypotheses for new physics states in Section III B 1.\nC.\n\nCompositeness\n\nAn alternative approach to the hierarchy problem relies on the fact that fermions, unlike\nscalars, have mass terms protected by chiral symmetry. As a result, quantum corrections to\nfermion masses are at most logarithmically sensitive to physics in the UV, and a theory with\nonly fermions and no fundamental scalars is natural. This suggests a another class of models\nof electroweak symmetry breaking that avoid the gauge hierarchy problem by replacing the\nfundamental Higgs scalar with the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of a composite scalar\noperator made up of fundamental fermion fields.\nA simple example of this already occurs within the Standard Model. Even without a\nHiggs VEV, electroweak symmetry breaking would still be induced by QCD, albeit at an\nunacceptably low scale near \u039bQCD . To see this, consider the fermion bilinear operator of two\nquarks \u03a8L \u03a8R , where the SU (3)c indices are contracted, \u03a8L is an SU (2)L doublet, and \u03a8R is\nan SU (2)L singlet. This operator has the quantum numbers of a Higgs boson: (1, 2, \u00b11/2).\nQCD confinement generates a non-zero expectation value for this bilinear operator on the\norder of \u039b3QCD \u223c (GeV)3 , thereby breaking the electroweak symmetry. In composite (or\ndynamical) models of electroweak symmetry breaking, this structure is extended to a new\nstrongly-coupled gauge group in place of SU (3)c with a scaled-up characteristic energy.\nThe interpretation of the composite operator \u03a8L \u03a8R depends on the nature of the underlying dynamics which produces its VEV. If there is a scalar bound state whose Fock\ndecomposition is mostly \u03a8L \u03a8R , we have a theory of a composite Higgs particle. It may be\napproximated as a theory containing a Higgs doublet up to the energy scale \u039b characterizing the binding energy of the \u03a8L \u03a8R system, but breaks down at higher scales. As such,\nnaturalness requires \u039b \u223c v so that the UV physics characterized by \u039b does not destabilize\nthe weak scale. The Little Higgs theories to be discussed in Section II D are a framework\nwhich extend this idea by providing an explanation for a gap of \u039b \u223c 4\u03c0v while retaining\nnaturalness. Other theories have no light particles corresponding to \u03a8L \u03a8R , and are truly\ntheories without a Higgs boson.\n50\n\n\fWhatever the details of the composite particle spectrum, strong coupling is required. At\ntree level, one expects the coefficient of the quadratic term in the effective potential for\nh\u03a8L \u03a8R i will be related to the masses of the fermions. The corresponding coefficient is given\nby (mL + mR )2 at tree level and is at best zero when the fermions in question are massless.\nA VEV requires the quadratic term in the effective potential be less than zero. In order to\novercome the tree level expectation, large corrections from higher-order processes must drive\nthe quadratic term negative; something that can only occur in the limit of strongly-coupled\ndynamics.\n1.\n\nTechnicolor\n\nElectroweak symmetry breaking in technicolor models follows closely what we know about\nQCD and the breakdown of the approximate chiral SU (2)L \u00d7 SU (2)R flavor symmetry of\nthe theory with two flavors of light quarks [36, 42]. Because QCD is asymptotically free, at\nenergies below \u039bQCD the quarks form condensates, i.e. two\u2013quark operators will develop a\nvacuum expectation value. This operator spontaneously breaks the chiral flavor symmetry\ninto its diagonal isospin SU (2) subgroup. Below \u039bQCD , composite color-singlet mesons and\nbaryons become the relevant physical degrees of freedom, with masses are of the order of the\nnucleon masses. The only light particles are the pions, corresponding to Nambu Goldstone\nBosons (NGBs) from the breakdown of SU (2)L \u00d7 SU (2)R . Their coupling strength (or decay\nrate) is governed by f\u03c0 \u223c 100 MeV, defined by 0|j\u03bc5 |\u03c0 = if\u03c0 p\u03bc . In terms of Nc and \u039bQCD\nthere are scaling rules in QCD which are based on for example \u03b2 \u221d Nc (and which strictly\nspeaking do not hold arbitrarily well):\np\nf\u03c0 \u223c Nc \u039bQCD\nQQ \u223c Nc \u039b3QCD\nmfermion \u223c \u039bQCD\n(72)\nThe chiral symmetry breaking of QCD results in W and Z masses on the order of MeV.\nThe simplest technicolor models simply scale up \u039bQCD to the TeV scale by postulating a\nnew strong sector, typically with an SU (N ) gauge group with Nf flavors of technifermions\nQi which are fundamentals of SU (N ). Each flavor contains two Weyl-fermion components,\nreflecting a global SU (Nf )\u00d7SU (Nf ) symmetry. Under the electroweak SU (2)L gauge group\nthey have the usual left-right charge structure characteristic of the quarks in the Standard\nModel. The new SU (N ) interaction confines, hQ\u0304i Qj i \u223c \u039b3TC \u03b4ij , and breaks the electroweak\nsymmetry. A subset of the would-be Goldstone bosons of the broken SU (Nf ) \u00d7 SU (Nf )\nflavor symmetry serve as the longitudinal degrees of freedom for the W and Z bosons. All\nwe have to ensure is that fTC , the scaled-up version of f\u03c0 , gives us the correct value for the\nelectroweak scale. The scaling rules read\nr\nr\n\u221a\np\nN \u039bTC\nNf N\nfTC \u223c\nf\u03c0\n2v = Nf fTC \u223c\nf\u03c0\n(73)\nNc \u039bQCD\nNc\nWe can solve these relations for fTC and \u039bTC . For example for N = Nf = 4 and \u03b1s (MGUT ) \u223c\n1/30 we find \u039bTC \u223c 800 \u039bQCD \u223c 165 GeV. This gives a reasonable v = 190 GeV and\ngenerates the required hierarchy between v and MGUT via dimensional transmutation.\nUnfortunately for technicolor, electroweak symmetry has a second function: it also generates the fermion masses. To explain all fermion masses with a composite condensate\nrequires higher dimensional operators that link the technicolor condensate to the Standard\n51\n\n\fModel fermions, with a specific operator for each of the vastly different fermion masses in\nthe Standard Model. The most popular means to accomplish this task is through extended\ntechnicolor (ETC) [289] which introduces a set of gauge bosons with masses of the order of\n\u039bET C which couple to both the technifermions and the Standard Model fermions. At low\nenergies, integrating out the ETC bosons and Fierzing the four-fermion operators results in\noperators such as\n1\nQQ\u03c8 L \u03c8R + h.c. \u2192 m\u03c8 \u03c8 L \u03c8R + h.c. ,\n(74)\n2\n\u039bETC\nwith m\u03c8 \u223c N \u039b3TC /\u039b2ETC . For quark masses in the GeV range this means a reasonable\n\u039bETC \u223c 2 TeV. But to generate the top mass, the ETC scale cannot be much larger than\nthe technicolor scale; \u039bETC \u223c \u039bTC \u223c v. This is a problem, since in order to generate the\nobserved mixings in the quark and lepton sectors of the Standard Model, the ETC bosons\nmust encode nontrivial flavor structure in their coupling to Standard Model fermions and\ncan therefore induce dangerous new flavor-mixing effects.\nETC gauge boson exchange also leads to four-fermion operators involving just the Standard Model fermions, leading to flavor-violating effects which are strongly bounded, naively\nrequiring \u039bETC & 1000 TeV [290]. The most popular remedy to this problem with FCNCs\nis to adjust the matter content charged under the technicolor group such that it becomes\napproximately conformal, or walks [291]. This allows for large anomalous dimensions to\nrescale the ETC interactions which involve technifermion bilinears, enhancing them and allowing for larger choices of \u039bETC . The dangerous SM-only FCNC interactions do not feel\nthe effects of technicolor, and are thus relatively suppressed. The large top mass remains a\nchallenge, even for modern theories of walking technicolor, requiring multiple ETC scales,\nnon-commuting family structure, larger technifermion representations, and/or fundamental\nscalars [292, 293].\nExtended technicolor models are further challenged by measurements of the Z-b-b\u0304 interaction [294]. The same ETC interactions which produce the top quark mass operator also\nresult in the vector operator\n1\n\u039b2ETC\n\nQL \u03b3\u03bc \u03c4 a \u03c83L\n\n\u0001\n\n\u03c8 3L \u03b3 \u03bc \u03c4 a QL\n\n\u0001\n\n\u2192\n\n1\n\u039b2ETC\n\nQL \u03b3\u03bc \u03c4 a QL\n\n\u0001\n\n\u03c8 3L \u03b3 \u03bc \u03c4 a \u03c83L\n\n\u0001\n\n(75)\n\nincluding techni-quarks Q and the third generation Standard Model quark doublet \u03c83L .\nThe second expression is obtained by a Fierz transformation. Since this operator is also\nresponsible for the top mass, even in a multi-scale ETC model, the relevant scale is \u039bETC \u223c v.\nReplacing the vector operator of techniquarks with the corresponding techni-pion operator,\nQL \u03b3\u03bc \u03c4 a QL \u2192\n\nv2\nTr \u03a3\u2020 \u03c4 a iD\u03bc \u03a3\n2\n\n(76)\n\nwhere \u03a3 = Exp 2i\u03c0Ta \u03c4 a /v, and moving to the unitary gauge, \u03a3 \u2192 1, results in a correction\nto the Z-b-b\u0304 interaction of v 2 /(2\u039b2ETC ) \u223c 1, generically in conflict with the experimental\nmeasurement of Rb = \u0393Z (bb\u0304)/\u0393Z (hadrons).\nNon-perturbative symmetry breaking dynamics at the weak scale are also a challenge\nto other precision electroweak measurements. In terms of the oblique parameters [22],\nthe generic expectation is that \u2206T will be of order one, as expected in the limit of a\nheavy Higgs boson, and \u2206S will depend on the number of technifermion doublets as\n\u2206S = Nf /(6\u03c0) [22, 295], in clear conflict with electroweak measurements [296]. Corrections to \u2206T can be controlled with an SU (2) custodial symmetry, and their sign depends\n52\n\n\fon the relative contribution of the new up-type and down-type fermions. In contrast, the\nnew particles' corrections to \u2206S tend to be positive, unless we apply drastic changes to the\nStandard Model setup. Non-standard effects on \u2206S are notoriously difficult to compute for\nnear-conformal theories and may be controlled by a variety of means [297]. An example of\ncomputable negative corrections to \u2206S arises in the framework of Higgsless theories to be\ndiscussed in Section II E 2.\nThe detailed spectrum of a technicolor model depends on the technifermion sector, and\nwill typically include massive vector and scalar particles, some of which may be colored if\nsome of the technifermions are charged under SU (3) [298\u2013300]. The most generic collider\nsignals are related to heavy vector particles (the techni-rhos) which are largely responsible\nfor unitarizing high energy W -W scattering . As a result, they must have large coupling to\nthe longitudinal W and Z bosons, but may have small or non-universal coupling to fermions.\n2.\n\nTopcolor-assisted technicolor\n\nTop-color-assisted technicolor models provide an alternate means to generate the large\ntop mass, addressing the single largest defect of a typical technicolor model [302, 303].\nThese theories build on the idea of top condensation [304], dynamically generating a Higgslike scalar with a vacuum expectation value that explains part of electroweak symmetry\nbreaking and has large coupling to the top. The theory doubles the color gauge sector of the\nStandard Model to SU (3)1 \u00d7 SU (3)2 . The top quark (both Q3 and tR ) are triplets under\nSU (3)1 and the light quarks are triplets under SU (3)2 . At the scale of a few TeV, this\nstructure breaks down through some usually unspecified dynamics, resulting in an unbroken\nStandard Model color SU (3)c and a massive color octet of topgluons. The couplings are\nusually chosen such that the topgluons are mostly massive SU (3)1 bosons, and the ordinary\ngluons are mostly the SU (3)2 gluons. This choice results in the topgluons coupling strongly\nto top quarks and weakly to the light quarks. The unbroken SU (3)c symmetry guarantees\nthat the massless bosons couple universally to all of the quarks.\nThe effects of the topgluon below its mass are encapsulated by contact interactions, the\nmost important of which is\n\u2212\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\ng2\ng2\n\u03bc a\na\n[\nt\u0304\n\u03b3\nT\nt\n]\nQ\u0304\n\u03b3\nT\nQ\n=\n\u2212\n[\nt\u0304\nQ\n]\nQ\u0304\nt\nR\nR\nL\n\u03bc\nL\nR\nL\nL\nR\nM2\nM2\n\n(77)\n\nwhere g is the topgluon coupling to top quarks and M is its mass. QL is the third family\nquark doublet and the last equality is easily understood as a Fierz transformation.\nFour-fermion interactions of this kind, but involving the light quarks, have been extensively studied as a low energy model of QCD and chiral symmetry breaking, the Nambu-Jona\nLasinio model [305]. If g is large enough, this interaction results in scalar bound states. To\nstudy these we can write down an effective theory for the four-fermion interaction in terms\nof an auxiliary field \u03a6,\n1\nL (\u039b) = gt Q\u0304L tR \u03a6 + gt\u2217 t\u0304R QL \u03a6\u2217 \u2212 \u039b2 |\u03a6|2\n2\n\n(78)\n\nwhere \u03a6 transforms as a Standard Model Higgs, but has no kinetic terms at the scale \u039b.\nWe require g 2 /M 2 = gt2 /\u039b2 to match to the topgluon operator.\n53\n\n\fBelow the scale \u039b, kinetic terms for \u03a6 as well as a quartic interaction are induced at\none loop, and the parameters \u039b2 and gt are renormalized. The form of the effective theory\nat the scale \u039b determines the renormalization constants Z(\u039b) = 0 and m2 (\u039b) = \u039b2 . The\nLagrangian then reads\n\u0001\n1\nL (\u03bc) = Z(\u03bc) (D\u03bc \u03a6)2 \u2212 m2 (\u03bc)|\u03a6|2 \u2212 \u03bb(\u03bc)|\u03a6|4 + gt (\u03bc) Q\u0304L tR \u03a6 + h.c.\n2\n\n(79)\n\nwhere\n\u0012 \u0013\ngt2\n\u039b\n+ ...\nZ(\u03bc) = Nc\nlog\n2\n16\u03c0\n\u03bc\ng2\nm2 (\u03bc) = \u039b2 \u2212 Nc t 2 \u039b2 + ...\n8\u03c0\n\n(80)\n\nwith similar expressions for gt (\u03bc) and \u03bb(\u03bc). Note that beyond a critical coupling value\n2\nthe scalar mass squared m2 (\u03bc) becomes negative, and the scalar field\ngt2 > 8\u03c0 2 /Nc \u2261 gcrit\ndevelops a vacuum expectation value, h\u03a6i = vt , breaking the electroweak symmetry.\nIts kinetic terms are canonically normalized by scaling \u03a6 \u2192 Z \u22121/2 \u03a6. In terms of the\ncanonically normalized field the prefactors in the Lagrangian Eq. (80) become m2 \u2192 Z \u22121 m2 ,\n\u03bb \u2192 Z \u22122 \u03bb, and gt \u2192 Z \u22121/2 gt . A useful approximation to determine the physics at the\nelectroweak scale is to fix these parameters such that m2 (\u039b) \u223c \u221e and gt (\u039b) \u223c \u03bb(\u039b) \u223c \u221e,\nsince all of these are finite in the unnormalized theory at \u039b and going to the canonical\nnormalization divides each by a positive power of Z(\u039b) ' 0 at that scale. We then use the\nrenormalization group to determine the parameters at scales \u03bc \u2264 \u039b.\nFar below \u039b, the theory looks like the Standard Model with the Higgs potential parameters m2 and \u03bb and the top Yukawa coupling gt all predicted in terms of the original parameters \u039b and gt , provided gt > gcrit so the electroweak symmetry is broken. The top mass\nis then given by mt = gt vt . Since part of electroweak symmetry breaking also arises from\ntechnicolor, the topcolor vacuum expectation value cannot account for the entire amount\nof symmetry breaking, i.e. vt < v. Therefore, gt is larger than the SM top Yukawa coupling, implying enhanced rates e.g. for single Higgs production gg \u2192 h0 [306]. In addition,\nthe longitudinal W and Z are now mixtures predominantly composed of the technifermion\nGoldstone bosons, but with some components from \u03a6. The orthogonal mixtures are physical\nscalar states with large couplings to top, the top pions [307].\nAt the LHC, a topgluon can be produced by q q\u0304 annihilation. While the coupling of\nthe topgluon to light quarks is not huge, the fact that the light quark parton densities are\nsizeable at large x values usually renders this the dominant production mechanism. Once\nproduced, the large coupling to top quarks dictates a dominant topgluon decay into a tt\u0304\npair. Thus, the signature is a resonant structure in the invariant mass of tt\u0304 pairs. While\nnot as clean as a decay into leptons, decays into tops still have a lot of potential compared\nto backgrounds, because top decays produce jets enriched with bottom quarks which can be\ntagged and also a fair fraction of leptonic W decays, see also Section III D.\n3.\n\nTop seesaw\n\nOne might be tempted to abandon the technicolor part of topcolor-assisted technicolor,\nand try to use topcolor as the entire mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking. That is,\n54\n\n\fin fact, what the original top condensation models set out to do [304]. However, in practice,\nlow scale topcolor generally has difficulty getting the right amount of electroweak symmetry\nbreaking and the correct top mass. The reason is that full electroweak symmetry breaking\nwith vt = 174 GeV requires very large gt in Eq. (78), which in turn predicts a top mass in\nexcess of 700 GeV. A simple fix is provided by the topcolor top-seesaw models [308].\nThe top-seesaw introduces an additional vector-like quark \u03c7. Its right-handed component\nis charged under SU (3)1 while its left-handed component and tR are charged under SU (3)2 ,\nalong with the rest of the light Standard Model quarks. There is a gauge-invariant mass\nterm linking \u03c7L and tR , and a term induced by SU (3)1 \u00d7 SU (3)2 breaking which links \u03c7L\nand \u03c7R . The four-fermion operators induced by the topgluon now contain Q3L and \u03c7R , and\nthe Higgs is largely a composite of those two fields. Its vacuum expectation value induces a\nmass term linking Q3L and \u03c7R of size gt v \u223c 700 GeV. The top and \u03c7 masses may then be\nwritten in matrix form\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n0 gt v\ntR\n(t\u0304L \u03c7\u0304L )\n+ h.c.\n(81)\nMt\u03c7 M\u03c7\u03c7\n\u03c7R\nBy adjusting the values of Mt\u03c7 and M\u03c7\u03c7 , one can fix the lighter eigenstate to have mass\nmt , which means we can identify it with the top. There is also a heavier eigenstate with a\nmass in the TeV range. At scales below \u039b, the theory thus contains the Standard Model\nincluding a heavy composite Higgs doublet whose would-be Goldstones are now completely\neaten, plus the TeV-scale quark. This heavy quark provides a relatively large contribution\nto \u2206T and only a small contribution to \u2206S, and can balance the heavy Higgs, resulting in\na reasonably good fit to precision data provided \u039b & 1 TeV [308].\nThe ingredients of a top-seesaw theory occur naturally in extra dimensional models, with\nthe role of the topgluon played by the KK gluons, and \u03c7 by the KK modes of tR [309]. The\nvector-like quark can be pair-produced at the LHC, or singly produced through its mixing\nwith top, as in t-channel single top production. Decays into W b, Zt, are kinematically\nallowed for typical regions of parameter space, and the decay to a Higgs ht is present when\nthe Higgs is light enough. In the limit of m\u03c7 \u001d mt , mh , these occur in the ratio 2 : 1 : 1,\nmuch as in the case of the vector-like top partner quark found in the Little Higgs theories\nto be discussed next.\nD.\n\nLittle Higgs models\n\nAs we have seen in the preceding sections, when the Standard Model is extended to\naddress the gauge hierarchy problem new experimental conflicts frequently appear. Without\ndedicated symmetries, new physics near the TeV scale will typically generate flavor and CP\nviolation well beyond what we observe, and it can alter the values of precision electroweak\nobservables in conflict with experiment. To avoid these constraints, the mass scale of new\nphysics typically has to be greater than 10 TeV or more. However, new physics this heavy\ndoesn't do a very good job at stabilizing the electroweak scale near 200 GeV, and some\ndegree of fine-tuning is needed. While this is not necessarily disastrous, and the fine-tuning\ninvolved is much smaller than in the standard gauge hierarchy problem, this little hierarchy\nproblem is a puzzling feature when naturalness was the motivation for introducing new\nphysics in the first place.\n55\n\n\fLittle Higgs (LH) models are extensions of the Standard Model designed specifically\nto address the little hierarchy problem [310]. In other words, we do not require them to\ncomplete as a weakly interacting renormalizable field theory up to some kind of GUT scale.\nThe key idea is to keep the Higgs very light relative to the new physics by making it a\nNambu-Goldstone boson [311] of an approximate global symmetry. This is the standard\nway to protect small masses in field theories. Note that if the symmetry is not exact, the\nwould-be NGB does not have to be massless. Unfortunately, this general idea turns out to be\nproblematic, and an additional property of collective symmetry breaking is needed to keep the\nHiggs significantly lighter than the new states beyond the Standard Model [310]. Similar\nto supersymmetry, this hierarchy is maintained by a cancellation of one-loop quadratic\ndivergences between loops of Standard Model particles with loops involving new particle\nstates. In contrast to SUSY, however, these new states have the same spin as their Standard\nModel partners [41, 312].\nLH models are usually written in the language of non-linear sigma models (NLSM) [313].\nThese are an efficient way to describe the interactions of Nambu-Goldstone bosons that arise\nfrom the spontaneous breaking of a continuous global symmetry G down to a subgroup H.\nA NLSM is specified by the scale of symmetry breaking f and the pattern of symmetry\nbreaking G \u2192 H. We then obtain a G/H model as an effective field theory of the NGBs\nencoding the full symmetry structure of the underlying high scale theory. Given a symmetry\nbreaking scale f , the NLSM effective field theory is valid up to a UV cutoff on the order of\n\u039b ' 4\u03c0f . The physics above the cutoff \u039b is not specified other than it is assumed to respect\nthe symmetry group G and to spontaneously break to H at the energy scale f . It may even\ninvolve strong interactions and technicolor-like dynamics or supersymmetry [314].\nEarly attempts to realize the Higgs boson as an approximate NGB encountered serious\nproblems [311]. The underlying global symmetry G must be explicitly broken to generate\nan acceptable potential for the Higgs and induce electroweak symmetry breaking. Since\nthe Higgs should arise from an electroweak doublet, this can be achieved by gauging the\nSU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y subgroup of a larger group G. This setup explicitly breaks G because\nsome components of G multiplets couple to SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y gauge bosons while others do\nnot. Radiative corrections, including quadratically divergent gauge boson corrections to\nthe Higgs mass cut off at \u039b = 4\u03c0f , then induce a potential for the Higgs leading to an\nelectroweak breaking scale at v \u223c f . On the other hand, precision electroweak constraints\npush f & 1 TeV, so the minimal models is killed by the little hierarchy problem.\nThe source of difficulties in these early NGB Higgs models are quadratically divergent\none-loop corrections to the Higgs mass parameter from the electroweak gauge bosons and\nthe top quark. LH models avoid them through the mechanisms of collective symmetry\nbreaking [310, 315]. In product group LH models, a G1 \u00d7G2 subgroup of the global symmetry\ngroup G is gauged, where each Gi factor contains a copy of the electroweak group. Upon\nbreaking G \u2192 H, the gauged subgroup is broken to the SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y electroweak group\nof the Standard Model. Note that by gauging a subgroup of G, the global symmetry is\nexplicitly broken and the would-be NGBs from the spontaneous symmetry breaking at f\nacquire masses. The Higgs is embedded in this symmetry structure as an exact NGB if one\nor the other of the gauge couplings g1 or g2 of G1 \u00d7G2 vanishes [310, 315]. Put the other way\naround, both g1 and g2 must be non-zero for the Higgs boson to develop a potential, and\nthey collectively break the global symmetry group G. As an alternative we can also build\nsimple group LH models that realize collective symmetry breaking in a slightly different\n56\n\n\fT\nt\nh\na)\n\nt\nh\n\nt\n\nh\nb)\n\nh\nT\n\nc)\n\nh\n\nh\n\nFIG. 11: Cancellation of the top-quark quadratic correction to the Higgs mass by loops of the\ntop-partner T fermion in LH theories. Figure from Ref. [316].\n\nway [312].\nIt is straightforward to check that quadratically divergent one-loop gauge boson contributions to the Higgs mass parameter must be proportional to either g12 or g22 . In contrast,\ncollective symmetry breaking ensures that electroweak loop corrections to the Higgs potential depend only on the product g1 g2 . Therefore the dangerous quadratic gauge boson\ncorrections are absent at one-loop order. In terms of the gauge boson mass eigenstates, the\nlack of quadratic divergences can be interpreted as a cancellation between Standard Model\ngauge boson loops and new gauge bosons from the extended gauge group, which during\nsymmetry breaking acquire masses of order g f . The global symmetries ensure that the couplings of these states indeed lead to a cancellation. This is analogous to SUSY, where the\ncancellation occurs between loops of bosons and fermions. The new feature of LH models is\nthat this cancellation occurs between fields having the same spin.\nDealing with gauge boson loops through the symmetry structure unfortunately does not\ncure all problems of a NGB Higgs boson. Coupling the top to the Higgs also requires an\nexplicit breaking of the underlying global symmetry. We introduce this coupling in a way\nthat respects the collective symmetry breaking structure by adding new vectorial top-partner\nT fermions. This ensures that quadratically divergent top-sector corrections to the Higgs\nmass are absent at one-loop order. In terms of the fermion mass eigenstates, this arises as a\ncancellation between the top quark loop with loops of the heavy top partner T states which\nagain has a mass of the order f . We illustrate the corresponding diagrams in Fig. 11.\nWhile collective symmetry breaking forces the cancellation of quadratic divergences at\none-loop order, it does not remove logarithmic one-loop divergences or quadratic divergences\nat higher loop orders This is not a problem since these corrections are numerically small\nenough that they do not destabilize the electroweak scale within the NLSM, which is valid\nonly up the scale \u039b = 4\u03c0f . In fact, the one-loop logarithmic corrections are essential to\ngenerate a potential for the Higgs field. This potential can induce electroweak symmetry\nbreaking for certain ranges of model parameters. The leading contribution in this case\ntypically comes from loops of the top quark and its heavy partners [315].\nGoing beyond these generic structures, the precise particle content and phenomenology\nof LH models depends on the pattern of symmetry breaking. Popular examples include\nthe minimal moose model based on [SU (3)L \u00d7 SU (3)R /SU (3)V ]4 with a gauged SU (3) \u00d7\nSU (2) \u00d7 U (1) subgroup [317], the littlest Higgs model with SU (5)/SO(5) global symmetry\nand a gauged [SU (2)\u00d7U (1)]2 subgroup [318], and the simplest LH model based on [SU (3)\u00d7\nU (1)/SU (2)]2 with a gauged diagonal SU (3)\u00d7U (1) subgroup [319]. For some other examples\nof LH models, see Refs. [320]. Despite a wide variety of constructions, all models share some\n57\n\n\fcommon features: to ensure the cancellation of one-loop quadratic corrections to the Higgs\nmass, new gauge boson and top quark partners with masses around f must appear in the\nspectrum. Embedding the Higgs boson into a multiplet of NGBs also gives rise to additional\nscalar states, often carrying electroweak charges.\nThe strongest current bounds on LH models come from precision electroweak constraints.\nThe new heavy gauge bosons mix with the Standard Model electroweak gauge bosons and\nmodify their masses and couplings to matter fields, and condensing electroweak triplet scalars\nmodify the pattern of electroweak symmetry breaking [321\u2013323]. To satisfy the precision\nelectroweak data, the symmetry breaking scale f must typically be larger than several TeV,\nalthough values as low as 1 TeV are possible within restricted parameter regions of some\nmodels [321]. When the scale f grows larger than a TeV, we need a fine tuning to stabilize\nthe value of electroweak symmetry breaking, so we yet again run into a little hierarchy\nproblem. This tension has motivated several extensions of the LH models described above.\nFor example, the minimal moose model can be extended to include an explicit SU (2)C\ncustodial symmetry [324], as can the littlest Higgs model [325].\nA more radical approach to the precision electroweak tension in LH models is to introduce\na new discrete symmetry called T parity [60, 326] Under this Z2 symmetry, which acts by\nexchanging the product gauge groups G1 and G2 , the Standard Model gauge bosons are\neven while the new gauge bosons and scalars are (generally) odd. This symmetry forbids\ntree-level corrections to the electroweak observables from gauge boson mixing. Instead,\nthe leading electroweak corrections only arise at loop level, and values f < 1 TeV are be\nconsistent with current data [327]. Adding fermions while preserving T -parity requires a\ndoubling of the spectrum of SU (2)L doublet states. The particle spectrum below the scale\nf consists of T -even Standard Model fermions, along with a set of heavy T -odd partner\nstates. In the case of the top quark and its partners, additional vector SU (2)L singlet states\nmust also be included to preserve the collective symmetry breaking structure. Depending\non how this is done, the lighter top quark partners can consist exclusively of T -odd states,\nor additional massive T -even states may be present as well [328, 329]. Interestingly, the\nadditional contribution of the heavy top partners to the precision electroweak fit allows the\nHiggs to be heavier than several hundred GeV in some regions of the parameter space [327].\nAmong the many new states in LH models with T parity, the lightest T -odd particle (LTP)\nis stable to the extent that T -parity is conserved. In the littlest Higgs model with T -parity,\nthe LTP is typically the T -odd hypercharge gauge boson partner BH , in turn providing a\nviable dark matter candidate [328, 330]. We should point out, however, that in some UV\ncompletions of LH theories with T parity, this new discrete symmetry is anomalous [331].\nThe operator induced by the anomaly leads to a prompt decay of the LTP to Standard Model\nparticles ruling it out as dark matter candidate in these models. Even so, the anomalous\nT -parity remains effective at loosening the electroweak constraints. It is also possible to\nextend the model structure to remove T -parity anomalies [332]. Unfortunately, it is not\npossible to implement T -parity in simple group LH models [312].\nThe collider signatures of LH theories depend crucially on whether the model has a T\nparity or not. Without T parity the new partner states can be singly produced, and can\ndecay directly to Standard Model particles. At the same time, electroweak constraints force\nthese states to be very heavy, with masses often well above a TeV.\nIn the littlest Higgs model there are exotic heavy charged WH\u00b1 vectors along with WH3 and\nBH neutral gauge bosons. Mixing among the neutral states will produce mass eigenstates\n58\n\n\f2\n\n! `\u0017bb\nZH ! ``bb\nVH ! jj\n\nATLAS\n\nWH\n\not \u0012\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\nZH ! `+` 0.5\n\nWH\n0\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\n! `\u0017\n5.5\n\n6\n\nM (TeV)\n\nFIG. 12: ATLAS reach for the massive electroweak vector bosons in the littlest Higgs model with\n300 fb\u22121 of data.

These exotic vector\nbosons are produced at the LHC primarily through Drell-Yan (q q\u0304 annihilation), and decay\nto Standard Model fermions or electroweak boson states [323, 333]. For example, the WH3\nstate has the decay widths [316, 323, 333]\ng 2 cot2 \u03b8\nMWH3\n96\u03c0\ng 2 cot2 2\u03b8\nMWH3\n\u0393(WH3 \u2192 Zh) =\n192\u03c0\n\ng 2 cot2 \u03b8\nMWH3\n32\u03c0\ng 2 cot2 2\u03b8\n\u0393(WH3 \u2192 W + W \u2212 ) =\nMWH3\n192\u03c0\n\n\u0393(WH3 \u2192 `+ `\u2212 ) =\n\n\u0393(WH3 \u2192 q q\u0304) =\n\n(82)\n\nwhile the charged exotic vector decays through WH\u2212 \u2192 `\u03bd\u0304, q q\u0304 0 , W \u2212 h. The LHC reach for\nthese states as a function of their masses and the model mixing parameter \u03b8 is shown in\nFig. 12. This reach is large enough that the LHC will cover regions of LH model parameter\nspace that have not yet been probed by the precision electroweak analyses. By measuring\ncross sections and branching ratios it may also be possible to study the underlying LH global\nsymmetry structure [316, 333\u2013335].\nThe LHC discovery reach for the heavy top partner T quark is more limited, extending\nto about 2.5 TeV in the littlest Higgs model [334]. Naturalness of the electroweak scale\nstrongly favors T masses that are not too heavy. Even so, it often turns out that the T\nquark is heavy enough that single production through the t-channel exchange of a W boson\nbeats the QCD pair production rate [316, 323]. Once created, the T quark can decay back\nto Standard Model states through the modes T \u2192 th, T \u2192 Z 0 t, and t \u2192 W + b, but may\nalso decay to lighter LH exotics. The branching ratios are related to the underlying global\nsymmetry structure [316]. For the littlest Higgs model we find\n\u0393(T \u2192 th) = \u0393(T \u2192 tZ) =\n\n1\n2\n\n\u0393(T \u2192 bW + ) =\n\n\u03bb2T\nMT ,\n64\u03c0 2\n\n(83)\n\nwhere \u03bbT is the effective T -Higgs Yukawa coupling. As for the gauge bosons, the underlying\n59\n\n\fLH structure of the theory can be probed by measuring these T -quark branching ratios [316,\n335].\nFinally, in the Higgs sector, a distinctive doubly charged \u03c6++ scalar is present in many\nmodels including the littlest Higgs. This state can be produced at the LHC by in weak boson\nfusion. Its most spectacular decay goes to like-sign leptonic W bosons [323, 334]. As in any\nextended Higgs or scalar model, the light SM-like Higgs boson can mix with new heavy\nneutral scalar states modifying its couplings by corrections on the order of v 2 /f 2 [336].\nThe collider signatures of LH models change drastically if there is a conserved T parity.\nAll T -odd partners must be produced in pairs, and the LTP is stable on collider time scales.\nWhen a pair of T -odd states is produced, they will each decay through a cascade down to\nthe LTP giving rise to missing energy signatures analogous to the those occurring in supersymmetry with R-parity or UED with KK parity and discussed in detail in Section III B.\nT -parity also allows the new partner states to be much lighter (than without the symmetry)\nwhile remaining consistent with precision electroweak constraints.\nThe T -odd top partner state T\u2212 is created primarily through QCD pair production. These\nwill cascade down to the LTP, typically emitting top quarks along the way and giving rise\nto top-rich signatures with missing energy [328, 329, 337]. In the littlest Higgs model with\nT -parity, the LTP is the hypercharge gauge boson partner BH , and the odd top partner\nT\u2212 generally decays through T\u2212 \u2192 t BH [328], although the T \u2192 WH+ b and T\u2212 \u2192 WH3 t\nchannels can open up for certain implementations of the top partners [329]. Some models\nalso contain a T -even top partner T+ whose behavior is similar to the top partner without\nT -parity except that T+ \u2192 T\u2212 BH can sometimes occur as well [328, 329].\nIn addition to the top partners, electroweak processes can produce pairs of the T -odd\nvector boson partners WH\u00b1 , WH3 , and BH , as well as T -odd scalar partners at the LHC. With\nBH being the LTP, the dominant decay modes of the heavier vector partners are WH\u00b1 \u2192\nW \u00b1 BH and WH3 \u2192 h BH [328]. These decays can mimic chargino and neutralino decays in\nthe MSSM. The decay modes of the scalar partners are more model-dependent. Additional\nsignals can arise from the heavy T -odd SU (2)L doublet partners of the other quarks and\nleptons [338]. When T -parity is anomalous, the LTP will generally decay promptly to\nStandard Model states. For instance, in the littlest Higgs model the BH vector LTP then\ndecays quickly to W + W \u2212 or Z 0 Z 0 [339].\nBeyond LH models, a number of related scenarios have been proposed that also realize the\nHiggs as an approximate NGB. In Twin Higgs models the particle content of the Standard\nModel is doubled by including an independent mirror sector with the same field content as\nthe Standard Model. Both sectors are related by a softly broken Z2 exchange symmetry.\nThe Higgs sectors of both copies are also embedded in a global symmetry structure with\na gauged product subgroup [340\u2013342]. For example, the original model consists of a global\nSU (6) \u00d7 SU (4) \u00d7 U (1) group in the Higgs sector, with a gauged [SU (3) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1)]A \u00d7\n[SU (3) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1)]B subgroup [340\u2013342]. These two factors make up the gauge groups\nof each of the two sectors, and their coupling strengths are (approximately) equal to each\nother due to the exchange symmetry. The first A copy is identified with the Standard Model\nand the second B copy with the mirror sector. A portion of the B-sector symmetries are\nassumed to be spontaneously broken at the scale f , and a light Higgs boson in the A-sector\nthen arises as a pseudo-NGB. The approximate global symmetry together with the exchange\nsymmetry ensure that it does not receive any quadratically divergent loop corrections to its\nmass at one-loop order.\n60\n\n\fIn terms of Feynman diagrams, the cancellation of quadratic Higgs mass corrections occurs between contributions from particles having the same spins as their Standard Model\ncounterparts, but charged under a different set of gauge symmetries. A similar structure\narises in folded supersymmetry scenarios, except that here the quadratic Standard Model corrections to the Higgs mass are cancelled by loops of superpartners in the mirror sector [343].\nThe phenomenology of twin and folded Higgs scenarios depends very much on the underlying global and gauge symmetry structure of the model. Much of the new mirror sector can\nbe largely decoupled and difficult to probe at the LHC [340]. Other constructions, however,\ncontain new vector-like quarks and additional vector bosons and scalars [342], which can\nprovide interesting new signals [344]. A more unusual feature of some of these constructions are massive vector-like fermions that are charged under both the visible electroweak\ngroup as well as a confining gauge group in the mirror sector [340, 343]. When the fermion\nmass is much larger than the mirror confinement scale, these states are called quirks, leading to highly unusual LHC signals at the LHC [345\u2013347]. We will discuss them further in\nSection II F.\nE.\n\nWarped Extra Dimensions\n\nWarped or Randall-Sundrum (RS) models are a wide class of extra-dimensional scenarios\nin which the extra dimension has an intrinsic curvature [348, 349]. This warping of spacetime\nis their defining feature, and can provide a natural explanation for the large hierarchy\nbetween the electroweak and Planck scales [348, 350]. For a bulk curvature k, the natural\nenergy scales at any two points separated by a distance \u2206y in the extra dimension will\ndiffer by a warp factor e\u22122k\u2206y . We will show how this exponential dependence allows the\nelectroweak scale to be derived from the Planck scale according to TeV \u223c ek\u2206y MPl .\nRS models, like other theories of extra dimensions, can also provide a geometric interpretation for the wide range of Yukawa coupling strengths of the Standard Model fermions.\nThis feature relies on the Standard Model fermions' wave functions in the extra dimension\nhaving very different overlaps with the Higgs field. Since the relative overlap depends exponentially on the underlying model parameters, a very large coupling hierarchy can arise\nfrom inputs of order unity.\nWarped extra dimensions are also thought to be related in a very deep way to fourdimensional approximately conformal field theories through something called the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence. As such, RS models may be either interpreted as theories with a genuine\nextra spatial dimension, or as a powerful tool to perform calculations in classes of theories\nsimilar to walking technicolor that cannot be treated perturbatively. Since the infrared\nphysics is thought to be the same in both cases, the distinction is not very important from a\nphenomenological point of view, even though the language used to describe the two classes\ntheories is often quite different.\nIn this subsection we discuss several phenomenological implementations of warped extra\ndimensions. This includes minimal and bulk RS models, Higgsless models of electroweak\nsymmetry breaking, and holographic composite Higgs models. For more detailed discussions\nof RS scenarios, we refer to one of the many reviews of these models [14, 351\u2013353].\n\n61\n\n\fH\n\u22122k|y|\n\ne\nUV\ny=0\n\nIR\ny\n\ny = \u03c0R\n\nFIG. 13: Diagram of the RS spacetime. The natural mass scale on the UV brane at y = 0 is on the\norder of M\u2217 \u223c MPl , while the natural mass scale on the IR brane at y = \u03c0R is e\u2212k\u03c0R M\u2217 \u223c TeV.\nIn the minimal RS model, the Higgs is localized on the IR brane.\n1.\n\nMinimal warped models\n\nThe standard RS scenario consists of a 5-dimensional bulk spacetime bounded on either\nend by two 4-dimensional surfaces called branes. For technical convenience, the extra dimension is often written in terms of an S 1 /Z2 orbifold, which just means that the coordinate\nof the fifth dimension lives in the periodic interval y \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0 R, \u03c0 R], and that the points\ny \u2194 \u2212y are identified with each other. As far as the low-energy theory is concerned, this\nis completely equivalent to working on an interval between y = 0 and y = \u03c0 R [351]. In\nterms of y and the usual four-dimensional coordinates x\u03bc , the spacetime between the branes\nis described by the metric [348]\nds2 = gM N dX M dX N = e\u22122k|y| \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd \u2212 dy 2\n\n(84)\n\nwhere k is a constant describing the curvature of the extra dimension and \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd is the usual\nMinkowski metric in four dimensions. We illustrate this spacetime in Fig. 13. This metric\nis a solution to the five-dimensional classical Einstein equations in the presence of a bulk\ncosmological constant. To obtain an effective Minkowski metric in the four-dimensional lowenergy effective theory, it is necessary to tune the tensions of the two branes to cancel off\nthe total cosmological constant in the low-energy four-dimensional effective theory.\nThis warped metric corresponds to a finite slice of the symmetric spacetime AdS5 with\ncurvature k. A natural value of k is of the same order as the fundamental five-dimensional\nPlanck scale M\u2217 . In terms of these underlying fundamental parameters, the effective fourdimensional Planck scale is given by [348]\n2\nMPl\n=\n\nM\u22173\n(1 \u2212 e\u22122\u03c0 kR ).\nk\n\n(85)\n\nThus, for k R & 1 we expect k \u223c M\u2217 \u223c MPl . In contrast to the case of flat large extra\ndimensions, this means that the compactification of warped extra dimensions does not affect\nthe hierarchy problem.\nInstead, RS models provide a nice explanation for the gauge hierarchy when the Higgs\nfield H is confined to the brane at y = \u03c0 R.

From\nthis expression we see that the expectation value of the Higgs boson, i.e. the electroweak\nscale, is given by\nhH 0 i = v = e\u2212\u03c0kR V.\n(87)\n\nWithout another mass scale in the game, the natural value of V in the full extra-dimensional\ntheory is on the order of the fundamental scale M\u2217 \u223c MPl \u223c k. However, the fourdimensional Higgs expectation value is warped down from V by an exponential factor. This\nexponential warping therefore provides a solution to the gauge hierarchy problem provided\nwe postulate kR \u223c 11:\nkR \u223c 11\n\n\u21d2\n\n\u039b\u03c0 \u2261 e\u2212\u03c0kR MPl \u223c TeV.\n\n(88)\n\nSuch values of kR can arise naturally if there is a scalar radion field in the bulk that\nstabilizes the size of the fifth dimension [350]. In the spirit described above, the natural\nvalue of any dimensionful coupling in the underlying theory is on the order of M\u2217 . When\nthe corresponding term in a dimension-four Lagrangian is related to fields localized near the\nbrane at y = \u03c0 kR, its value in the low-energy four-dimensional effective theory is warped\ndown to near the electroweak scale. For this reason, the brane at y = \u03c0 R is frequently\ncalled the IR or TeV brane while the brane at y = 0 is often called the UV or Planck brane.\nIn the minimal RS model (RS1) all Standard Model fields are localized on the IR\nbrane [348]. In this case, the primary source of new physics signals comes from the graviton.\nThis field describes fluctuations of the spacetime structure and necessarily propagates in\nall the dimensions. Just like in ADD models, we can expand the graviton field hM N into\ncomponents h\u03bc\u03bd and \u03c6. Of these, the h\u03bc\u03bd field is symmetric and traceless, couples to the\nenergy-momentum tensor, and contains the usual four-dimensional massless graviton. The\n\u03c6 field is called the radion and describes fluctuations in the size of the fifth dimension. It\ncouples to the trace of the energy momentum tensor. There are also other components\nin the expansion of hM N , but as discussed in Section II B 1, they do not couple to the IR\nbrane and can be neglected. Concentrating on h\u03bc\u03bd , we can expand it into a tower of spin-2\nKaluza-Klein (KK) excitations,\nh\u03bc\u03bd (x, y) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nh(n)\n\u03bc\u03bd (x) gn (y).\n\n(89)\n\nn=0\n\nThe n = 0 zero mode in this expansion is massless and corresponds to the four-dimensional\ngraviton. In contrast to flat extra dimensions, however, the higher KK modes have widely\nspaced masses on the order of a TeV [348, 354],\nG\n\u2212k\u03c0R\nmKK\n,\nn = xn ke\n\nn = 1, 2, . . .\n\n(90)\n\nG\nThe constants xG\nn are given to an excellent approximation by Bessel function zeroes J1 (xn ) =\nG\nG\n0.

The theoretically understood region with\nk/MPl < 0.1 and \u039b\u03c0 < 10 TeV is shaded blue. Figure from Ref. [78].\n\nwith \u039b\u03c0 = e\u2212k\u03c0R MPl . Note that the massive KK modes couple with an inverse TeV-scale\ncouplings to matter, while the massless zero mode couples like the usual four-dimensional\ngraviton. This arises because the massive KK modes have wave functions in the extra\ndimension, gn (y) in eq. (89), that are peaked (or localized ) at the TeV brane. In contrast,\nthe massless zero mode is spread throughout the extra dimension and the fundamental scale\nassociated with its coupling is set by the Planck mass resulting in the weakness of gravity\nat long-distances.\nNew graviton KK-modes give rise to heavy dilepton and dijet resonances at colliders, similar to old-fashioned Z 0 searches. The existing bounds and future reach for these resonances\ncan be expressed in terms of k/MPl = ke\u2212k\u03c0R /\u039b\u03c0 and the mass of the first KK resonance\nmKK\n[354]. Perturbative calculability in the RS scenario requires k/MPl . 0.1, while\n1\n\u039b\u03c0 . 10 TeV is needed to avoid re-introducing a fine-tuning problem [348]. In Fig. 14 we\nshow the projected reach for the first RS KK graviton in dimuon final states at CMS [78].\nFor k/MPl between 0.01 and 0.1, the reach varies between about mKK\n= 1.7 TeV and\n1\n3.5 TeV. The spin-2 nature of the graviton KK mode can also be distinguished from a\nspin-0 or spin-1 resonance by examining angular correlations in the production and decay\nprocesses [78, 354\u2013357].\nThe minimal RS model described above can be generalized by allowing some or all of the\nStandard Model gauge and fermion fields to propagate in the five-dimensional bulk [358\u2013\n364]. Putting a gauge field in the bulk, we must take into account the fact that it now has\nfive components, AM with M = 0, 1, 2, 3, 5. Just like a gauge field in four dimensions, not all\nthese components lead to physical degrees of freedom. To separate the physical modes it is\nconvenient to apply the gauge condition \u22025 A5 = 0. We must also specify the boundary values\nof this bulk field on the two branes, and the natural choice that does not explicitly break\nany of the four-dimensional gauge symmetries we would like to preserve is the Neumann\n64\n\n\fcondition \u22025 A\u03bc |y=0,\u03c0R = 0 for the four-dimensional components and the Dirichlet condition\nA5 |y=0,\u03c0R = 0 for the fifth [351, 359, 360]. Together with our gauge choice, we see that\nA5 = 0 vanishes everywhere. Decomposing the remaining A\u03bc vector field into KK modes,\njust like the graviton field in the RS1 realization, we find a massless four-dimensional zero\nmode gauge field with a constant wave function in the extra dimension, as well as a tower of\nTeV-scale massive four-dimensional vector KK excitations localized towards the IR brane.\nTheir masses are similar to the RS1 graviton case [359, 360]\nA\n\u2212\u03c0kR\nmKK\n,\nn = xn ke\n\n(92)\n\nA\nwhere xA\n1,2,3 = 2.45, 5.57, 8.02, and xn \u2192 n\u03c0 for n \u001d 1. In this picture the fifth component\nA5 of the bulk gauge field does not appear explicitly in the spectrum. At each KK level it\nprovides the extra degrees of freedom for the massive KK vector bosons. This is analogous\nto the Higgs mechanism, where the would-be Goldstone boson is eaten by the gauge field to\nproduce a massive vector with an extra longitudinal degree of freedom.\nA phenomenological problem arises if only the Standard Model gauge fields propagate in\nthe bulk while the Standard Model fermions remain confined to the IR brane [359]. The\neffective gauge-matter couplings are proportional to the integrated overlap of their respective\nwave functions. When we fix the couplings of the zero-mode gauge fields to their Standard\nModel counterparts, the couplings of the massive vector \u221aKK-excitations to the Standard\nModel fermions are automatically enhanced by a factor of 2\u03c0 kR due to the localization of\nthe gauge KK-modes towards the TeV brane. This is the same effect which enhances the KK\ngraviton couplings starting from the first excitation. As a result, the KK-modes generate\ndangerously large corrections to precision electroweak observables, and the scenario is ruled\nout unless k e\u2212\u03c0kR & 11 TeV [359, 365]. The corresponding KK masses, both graviton and\ngauge, would then be too large to probe directly at the LHC, and this scenario would\nno longer provide a convincing solution to the gauge hierarchy problem. This negative\nconclusion can be avoided to some extent by adding large brane-localized kinetic terms on\nthe TeV brane which modify the boundary conditions and have the effect of pushing the\nKK modes away from the brane [283, 366, 367].\n\nThe situation is much better if both the Standard Model fermions and gauge fields are allowed to propagate in the fifth dimension [358, 361\u2013363]. The challenge is that bulk fermions\nin five dimensions are inherently non-chiral. The minimal possible fermion representation\nin this case has two opposite chiral components, corresponding to left- and right-handed\nspinors in four dimensions. To regain the chiral fermion structure of the Standard Model,\nwe can make use of the explicit breaking of the five-dimensional Lorentz symmetry by the\nbranes. For each Standard Model fermion in the bulk, we must add a partner with the\nopposite chirality. However, it is not necessary for both chiral components to have the\nsame boundary conditions on the branes, and only those chiral components with Neumann\nboundary conditions at both branes, \u2202y \u03c8L,R |y=0,\u03c0R = 0 will have a massless zero mode (up\nto coupling to the Higgs boson). By specifying Neumann boundary conditions for some of\nthe chiral fermion components, and mixed or Dirichlet boundary conditions for the rest,\nwe can regain a chiral set of fermion zero modes that coincides with the Standard Model\nfermions. On the other hand, the massive fermion KK modes will consist of fermions with\nboth chiralities.\nIn general, the Lagrangian for a five-dimensional fermion contains a bulk mass term\nwhich is conventionally expressed in terms of the curvature c k with a scaling factor c.\n65\n\n\fDespite the bulk mass, there can still arise a massless chiral zero mode for the left-handed\ncomponent with the natural boundary conditions (\u2202y + ck)\u03c8L |y=0,\u03c0R = 0 and \u03c8R |y=0,\u03c0R = 0.\nThe unpaired left-handed zero mode then has a profile in the fifth dimension proportional\nto [358, 361]\n(0)\n\u03c8L \u221d e\u2212(c\u22121/2)k|y| .\n(93)\nThus, the left-handed zero mode is exponentially localized towards the UV brane for c > 1/2,\nand exponentially localized towards the IR for c < 1/2. For a right-handed fermion zeromode, the natural boundary condition is (\u2202y \u2212 ck)\u03c8R |y=0,\u03c0R = 0 and \u03c8L |y=0,\u03c0R = 0, which\nyields the profile\n(0)\n\u03c8R \u221d e(c+1/2)k|y| .\n(94)\nNow, the right-handed zero mode is UV-localized for c < \u22121/2 and IR-localized when\nc > \u22121/2. By comparison, the lowest fermion KK modes are all localized near the IR brane\nwith approximate masses\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n(L,R)\nn1\nk e\u2212\u03c0kR\n(95)\nmn\n' \u03c0 n + (|c \u2213 1/2| \u2212 1) \u2212 (\u22121)\n2\n4\nwith n = 1, 2, . . . Note that since the gauge boson zero modes have flat profiles, they will\ncouple to each bulk fermion with equal strength (up to the charge of the state) no matter\nwhere in the bulk the fermion is localized.\nThe exponential localization of bulk fermion zero modes can provide a nice explanation\nfor the large variation among the observed Yukawa couplings, corresponding to Standard\nModel fermion masses [358]. With the Higgs confined to the to IR brane, the effective\nYukawa coupling of a given Standard Model fermion will be determined by how much the\ncorresponding zero-mode wave function overlaps with the IR brane. The heavy top quarks\nshould therefore be localized near the IR brane, while the very light electrons should lie\ncloser to the UV brane. We illustrate this localization in Fig. 15. Since the overlap on the\nIR brane is determined by an exponential of the bulk mass parameter c as in eq. (93), order\nunity variations in the bulk mass can produce Yukawa couplings that range over several\norders of magnitude. Thus, the large difference me \u001c mt can be obtained for similar and\nnatural parameter values in the underlying extra-dimensional theory.\nLocalizing fermions in different parts of the fifth dimension has the additional benefit\nof suppressing many of the potential new and dangerous sources of flavor violation coming\nfrom higher-dimensional operators relative to what they would be if all the Standard Model\nfermions were confined to the IR brane [364, 368, 369]. Even so, some further flavor alignment\nappears to be required to obtain a KK scale below 5 TeV [370\u2013373].\nMore importantly, this class of RS scenarios with Standard Model fermions and the\ngauge bosons residing in the bulk and the Higgs confined to the IR brane are strongly\nconstrained by precision electroweak measurements. With no additional structure, these\nbounds imply a KK scale k e\u2212\u03c0kR & 5 TeV [374\u2013376]. The electroweak constraints can\nbe weakened significantly by extending the bulk gauge symmetry to SU (3)c \u00d7 SU (2)L \u00d7\nSU (2)R \u00d7 U (1)X [377], including the approximate custodial SU (2)R global symmetry of\nthe Standard Model [378]. The extended gauge structure is explicitly broken down to the\nStandard Model subgroup SU (3)c \u00d7 SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y , with Y = (t3R + X), by a choice of\n(non-Neumann) boundary conditions for the gauge fields. This leaves KK modes for all the\ngauge bosons in the theory, but only allows massless zero modes for the Standard Model\ngauge bosons.\n66\n\n\f(0)\n\nA\u03bc\ne(0)\n\nt (0)\nH\n\nUV (MP)\n\nIR (TeV)\n\nFIG. 15: Localization of fermions and origin of the flavor hierarchy in bulk RS models. The\ndiagram is from Ref. [352].\n\nEven with an extended custodial bulk gauge symmetry, there can remain dangerously\nlarge corrections to the Z-bL -b\u0304L coupling, in contradiction to the measured value of Rb =\n\u0393Z (bb\u0304)/\u0393Z (hadrons) [23]. These can be further reduced to an acceptable level by including\na discrete PL,R parity that enforces equal SU (2)L and SU (2)R bulk gauge couplings, and by\nplacing bL into a non-minimal representation of the bulk group with t3L (bL ) = t3R (bL ) [379].\nWith this extended custodial gauge and fermion structure, precision electroweak bounds can\nbe consistent with a KK scale as low as k e\u2212\u03c0kR ' 1 TeV [380, 381] and KK gauge boson\nexcitations with masses below 3 TeV. The non-minimal fermion representations required in\nthis framework lead to exotic top-like custodial KK fermions with masses often below 1 TeV.\nThe bulk RS scenario can lead to interesting signatures at the LHC. Given the relative\nmasses and couplings of the various low-lying KK excitations, the most accessible mode is\ntypically the first KK excitation of the gluon [382, 383]. The KK gluon is a heavy color\noctet, and can be produced resonantly in the s-channel. Its decay modes are related to the\ngeography of the warped extra dimension. As discussed above, the low-lying KK excitations\nof the Standard Model gauge bosons are localized towards the IR brane. The fermion zeromodes corresponding to the top quark are also localized near the IR brane while the lighter\nStandard Model fermions are localized in the UV. This has the consequence that the KK\ngauge bosons couple much more strongly to the heavier SM fermions than to the lighter\nones. The massive KK gluon resonances, as well as the KK resonances of the other gauge\nbosons, therefore decay preferentially into top quarks, providing a way to differentiate them\nfrom Standard Model backgrounds and other types of heavy resonances.\nDetecting a massive KK gluon at the LHC presents a number of experimental challenges.\nUnless the tt\u0304 final state can be distinguished from ordinary dijets, the signal will be swamped\nby Standard Model backgrounds [382, 383]. For relatively slow-moving top quarks this is\nstraightforward to do by reconstructing the final state tops by identifying the bottom quarks,\njets, and leptons from t \u2192 W b. However, the top quarks emitted by a KK gauge boson\nwill typically have a very large boost, and as a result the decay products can be highly\ncollimated. Traditional jet identification algorithms will often combine all these products\ninto a single jet, possibly mistaking it for a more common light jet. The phenomenology of\nmassive boosted particles we discuss in Section III D, since they naturally appear in many\nmodels, even including the Standard Model.\n67\n\n\fAnother slightly less general source of collider signals for RS models are the exotic toplike custodial KK fermions motivated by precision electroweak bounds [379\u2013381]. These\nstates can have non-standard electromagnetic charges such as Q = 5/3, \u22121/3 in addition to\nQ = 2/3, and may be lighter than 1 TeV. This contrast with other scenarios such as little\nHiggs models, which typically on have top-partner states with Q = 2/3. The lightest of\nthe exotic KK states tend to be localized in the IR, and therefore have enhanced couplings\nto the KK gauge bosons [379, 380]. Depending on their masses and charges, single and\npair production can both be significant. These exotic fermions can also arise as the decay\nproducts of a KK gauge boson resonance. Once produced, the dominant decay channels are\nto top and bottom quarks along with a longitudinal W , Z, or Higgs bosons. For example,\nT5/3 \u2192 t W + \u2192 b W + W + can give rise to a distinctive same-sign dilepton signal[384, 385].\nFinally, potential RS signals at the LHC also arise from the KK excitations of the electroweak gauge bosons [386\u2013388], KK fermions [380, 381], mixing between the Higgs and the\nradion field [389], and black holes [390, 391].\nBefore moving on, let us mention that the AdS/CFT correspondence [392\u2013394] suggests\nthat the RS models discussed in this section have a fundamental connection to stronglycoupled scenarios in four dimensions. This correspondence was first seen in the many remarkable coincidences between type IIB supergravity in the ten-dimensional space AdS5 \u00d7S5\nwith N = 4 super-conformal SU (N ) Yang-Mills in four dimensions with N \u001d 1. As a result,\nthese two seemingly very different theories are thought to be dual to each other in that they\ndescribe the same physics at low energies. More generally, the AdS/CFT correspondence\nrelates certain conformal field theories in d dimensions to theories with gravity in (d + 1)\ndimensions. It is useful because when one description is strongly coupled, the other is often\nweakly coupled and easier to numerically analyze. The correspondence has been applied all\nthe way from superstring theory [395], to phenomenological model building, to QCD [396],\nto condensed matter physics [397].\nThe application of the AdS/CFT correspondence to phenomenology, and RS models in\nparticular, was initially studied in Refs. [398, 399]. The location in the fifth dimension\nof the RS spacetime is related to the energy scale in a nearly conformal four-dimensional\ngauge theory. The branes on either side of the slice of AdS5 bulk are interpreted as a\nbreaking of conformal invariance in the gauge theory at high and low energies. Starting at a\nvery high energy in the dual gauge theory description, the theory enters a strongly-coupled\nconformal regime at MPl corresponding to the Planck brane. The gauge coupling remains\nnearly constant over many decades during the renormalization group running down to lower\nenergies. This continues until the energy approaches \u039b\u03c0 , corresponding to the IR brane,\nwhich is interpreted as a spontaneous breaking of conformality. Here, the gauge coupling\ngrows large and the theory confines producing massive bound states. This behavior of the\ngauge theory coincides with that of walking technicolor discussed above, and thus RS models\nare thought to be special (dual) examples of these theories. In the limit of k/MPl \u001c 1 where\nthe RS solution can be trusted, the gauge theory dual is strongly coupled.\nBeyond connecting energy scales with the location in the extra dimension, the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence also provides a matching between the particles and symmetries in the two\ntheories. The KK excitations in RS correspond to bound-state resonances in the dual gauge\ntheory. Bulk RS fields are interpreted as mixtures of fundamental and composite fields in\nthe gauge theory, with fields localized closer to the IR brane being mostly composite and\nfields near the Planck brane mostly fundamental. The Higgs boson confined to the IR brane\nis entirely composite. Weakly-coupled gauge symmetries in the bulk (such as the Standard\n68\n\n\fModel gauge forces) represent genuine symmetries of the conformal sector. However, they\nmostly act as spectators to the much stronger conformal dynamics, and do not have to be\nconformal themselves. Global symmetries on the CFT side are also interpreted as gauge\nsymmetries in the bulk. This accounts for why an expanded bulk gauge symmetry is used\nto impose a custodial SU (2)R global symmetry on RS theories to protect them from large\nelectroweak corrections. The distinguishing feature is that global symmetries in the dual\ngauge theory correspond to bulk gauge symmetries in RS that are broken explicitly on the UV\nbrane. Weak spectator gauge symmetries in the gauge theory are only broken spontaneously\non the IR brane, if at all.\n2.\n\nHiggless models\n\nHiggless and holographic composite Higgs models are variations of the Randall-Sundrum\nscenario discussed above. Both classes of models are motivated by a little hierarchy problem\nin RS models. Indirect experimental constraints, like electroweak precision data, force the\nnatural mass scale of KK resonances to be greater than a TeV, while the mass of the Higgs\nboson and its corresponding expectation value generally cannot be much larger than a few\nhundred GeV. Some degree of fine-tuning is needed to maintain this hierarchy.\nIn Higgsless models the Higgs is removed altogether. In holographic composite Higgs\nmodels, the Higgs comes from a bulk gauge field and is a Nambu-Goldstone Boson of an\napproximate global symmetry. These approaches are reminiscent of technicolor and little\nHiggs models respectively. Indeed, we will describe below how the AdS/CFT correspondence relates Higgsless models to technicolor, and shows that composite Higgs models share\nfeatures with little Higgs scenarios at low energy.\nHiggless models of electroweak symmetry breaking are built around the RS spacetime\ndescribed above, consisting of a warped five-dimensional bulk space bounded on either end\nby two four-dimensional branes [400\u2013404]. The Standard Model vector fields propagate in all\nfive dimensions, and the W and Z vector bosons arise as massive Kaluza-Klein excitations.\nThis is qualitatively different from bulk RS models, where the W and Z states are massless\nzero modes before electroweak symmetry breaking induced by an explicit Higgs field on the\nIR brane.\nStandard model fermions in Higgless models also extend into all dimensions, and they\nhave explicit mass terms that are allowed by the non-chiral structure of the theory in the\nbulk and on the IR brane. Higgless models are reviewed in Ref. [351, 405].\nFor our purposes, it is most convenient to write the bulk RS metric as\n\u0012 \u00132\n\u0001\nR\n2\nds =\n\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd \u2212 dz 2 ,\nz\n\n(96)\n\nwith the branes located at z = R = k \u22121 and z = R0 > R. This metric is related to the one we\nused previously by the change of variables z = R ey/R . For a ratio of R0 /R \u223c 1016 GeV this\nframework can account for the hierarchy between the Planck mass and the electroweak scale.\nGauge fields are assumed to propagate within all five dimensions, and the electroweak gauge\nstructure of the minimal viable model is SU (2)L \u00d7SU (2)R \u00d7U (1)X . Boundary conditions for\nthe bulk gauge fields are chosen so that this gauge group is broken down to SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y\non the UV brane at z = R with Y = (t3R + X), and the diagonal SU (2)D SU (2)L \u00d7 SU (2)R\n69\n\n\fz=R\n\nz = R'\n\nSU(2) x SU(2) x U(1)\nL\n\nR\n\nUV\n\nB\u2212L\n\nIR\n\nSU(2) x U(1)\nL\n\nSU(2)\n\nY\n\nD\n\nFIG. 16: Bulk electroweak gauge symmetry structure of the warped-space Higgsless model. The\nSU (3)c QCD group is also present and unbroken everywhere in the bulk and on the branes.\n\non the IR brane at z = R0 [401\u2013403], as sketched in Fig. 16. The SU (3)c QCD group is\nunbroken everywhere in the bulk and on the branes.\nThe spectrum of electroweak vector bosons in this scenario consists of a single massless\nphoton along with KK towers of charged Wn and neutral Zn states [401]. The massive W\nand Z vectors of the Standard Model are identified with the lowest KK modes of the Wn\nand Zn towers. This is very different from the RS scenarios discussed previously where the\nW and Z arise as massless zero modes with flat profiles and get their masses entirely from\na Higgs VEV on the IR brane. Instead, in Higgless models there is no explicit Higgs boson,\nand the W and Z get KK masses from the SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y -violating boundary condition\non the IR brane. The masses and effective gauge couplings to fermions on the UV brane of\nthese states are (to leading order in R/R0 ) [401]\n1\nR0\nlog\nR02\nR\n2\n2\ng5 + 2g\u03035 1\nR0\n2\nMZ ' 2\nlog\ng5 + g\u030352 R02\nR\n\n1\nR0 1\n'\nR\nlog\n,\ng2\nR g52\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\nR0\n1\n+\n' R log\n,\ng 02\nR g52 g\u030352\n\n2\nMW\n'\n\n(97)\n\nwhere g5 is the bulk gauge coupling of SU (2)L and SU (2)R , assumed to be equal here for\nsimplicity. The bulk gauge coupling of U (1)X is g\u03035 . The masses of the massive KK modes\nare on the order of n\u03c0/R0 , n = 1, 2, . . ..\nThese expression also show that the inverse radius must be less than about R0 \u22121 . TeV\nto reproduce the observed W and Z masses. Higher KK modes will enter near a TeV.\nFrom the point of view of a low-energy four-dimensional observer, this scenario looks like\na theory with explicit masses for the W and Z vectors. On the face of it, this seems to\npresent a puzzle. Recall from Section I A that massive vector theories have problems at high\nenergies. Without a light Higgs boson underlying the vector mass, these theories typically\nbecome strongly-coupled at energies near 4\u03c0 MW \u223c 2 TeV, where MW is the vector mass.\nOn the other hand, the Higgless theory was derived from a weakly-coupled extradimensional theory that should be valid up to energies near 4\u03c0/R0 \u001d TeV. The resolution\nto this apparent puzzle is that compared to a generic theory of massive vectors, Higgsless\nmodels also contain a tower of heavier KK modes [400]. These should be included when\ncomputing the self-scattering of the W and Z vectors at energies near and above a TeV.\nAfter summing over all the KK modes contributing to the scattering, many cancellations\n70\n\n\foccur that postpone the onset of strong coupling to energies well above 4\u03c0 MW . A precise\ncalculation of the perturbative unitarity behavior shows that vector boson self-scattering\nbecomes strongly coupled at energies on the order of the cutoff of the extra-dimensional\ngauge theory, as one might expect [406].\nThe Standard Model fermions must now get masses, but without the help of a Higgs. This\ncan be achieved by putting them in the bulk and writing down mass terms which mix the\nSU (2) doublet and singlet fields on the IR brane [402, 403, 407]. Without such terms, the\ntheory would have chiral zero modes, and KK towers which, as discussed in Section II E 1,\nare non-chiral. Turning on the boundary masses mixes the would-be zero modes with the\noriginal basis KK modes, resulting in a massive spectrum which (together with bulk masses\nas usual and brane kinetic terms) allow one to generate the correct mass spectrum for the\nfermions [407]. As usual, there will be towers of both left- and right-chiral fermion KK\nmodes.\nThe most serious challenge to building viable models of Higgsless electroweak symmetry\nbreaking is satisfying the constraints from precision electroweak measurements [403, 408\u2013\n412]. Mixing of the W and Z with higher KK modes changes their couplings to fermions\nrelative to the Standard Model. Heavier KK modes are preferred to reduce these deviations\nto an acceptable level, but the KK modes can't be too heavy if they are to unitarize vector\nboson scattering. Both requirements can be satisfied simultaneously if there are localized\nkinetic terms on each of the branes [412], and if the Standard Model fermions have nearly flat\nprofiles in the bulk [413]. In this case the first vector boson KK modes above the Standard\nModel Z and W typically have masses in the 500-1500 GeV range [413].\nFurther model structure is needed to generate a sufficiently large top quark mass while\nnot overly disrupting the measured ZbL b\u0304L coupling. Some examples include new top-like\ncustodial bulk fermions [379, 414], or a second warped bulk space on the other side of the\nUV brane with its own IR brane [415].\nThe collider signatures of Higgless models are closely related to the constraints imposed\non them by the unitarization of gauge boson scattering and precision electroweak bounds.\nFor the scattering of the W and Z to remain perturbative at energies above a TeV, these\nstates must couple in a specific way to the heavier KK excitations [400]. This places a lower\nbound on the decay width of a given electroweak vector KK mode to the light Standard\nModel vector bosons. Precision electroweak constraints and flavor bounds can be satisfied\nif the light Standard Model fermions have nearly flat but slightly UV-localized bulk profiles\nso that their couplings to the IR-localized KK vector bosons are somewhat suppressed. The\ncouplings of the KK modes to the third generation are typically larger.\nWhen the vector KK modes have small couplings to the light generations but significant\ncouplings with the third, the Higgless collider signals are similar to those of the bulk RS scenarios discussed previously, with the KK modes decaying frequently to top quark pairs [416].\nThe main difference is that the new Higgsless KK resonances are considerably lighter than\nwhat is typically considered for bulk RS models. If the KK couplings to the third generation are not too large, additional new signals can arise in weak boson fusion. This is the\ndominant production channel for the electroweak KK modes when their couplings to light\nfermions are suppressed. In this context, new electroweak KK modes appear as resonances\nelectroweak gauge boson scattering. For example, W Z \u2192 W Z can be modified by an schannel W1 under the assumption that W1 does not couple significantly to fermions [417].\n71\n\n\fFIG. 17: Higgless signals in W Z \u2192 W Z scattering at the LHC. The resonance comes from a W1\nKK mode without any couplings to fermions. Also shown are two parameterizations (Pad\u00e9 and\nK-matrix) unitarizing vector boson scattering. Figure from Ref. [417].\n\nReconstructing a purely leptonic W Z invariant mass yields a distinctive transverse mass\npeak, as discussed in Section III B. In Fig. 17 we show the estimated signal compared to\nthe Standard Model background, as well as a pair of phenomenological schemes designed\nto describe the unitarization of massive vector boson scattering. This is only one example\nof electroweak scattering channels which will serve as discovery channels for Higgsless KK\nexcitation [418\u2013423]. Alternative signals appear in Higgless models with an extended top\nquark sector, including exotic vector-like custodial fermions [414, 424, 425].\nMany of the properties of Higgsless theories are also found to arise in models of technicolor. In both cases it is challenging to satisfy the precision electroweak constraints and to\ngenerate a large top quark mass. It is perhaps not so surprising then that the AdS/CFT correspondence discussed in Section II E 1 suggests that these five-dimensional warped models\nare dual to certain classes four-dimensional conformal technicolor theories [401, 411]. Under\nthis correspondence, the z = R brane matches onto a high energy scale where the technicolor\ngauge theory enters into a nearly conformal regime, while the z = R0 brane represents the\nenergy scale where the conformal running ends spontaneously and the gauge theory confines.\nThe SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y gauge symmetry present in the bulk and on the IR brane coincides\nwith a weakly-coupled spectator gauge group in the conformal technicolor theory that is\na subgroup of a larger global SU (2)L \u00d7 SU (2)R \u00d7 U (1)X symmetry. Another subgroup of\nthis global symmetry is a custodial SU (2) that protects the W and Z mass ratio. The\nexplicit breaking of SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y on the IR brane matches onto a spontaneous breaking\nof this group by the confining transition of the technicolor dynamics. In this context, the\nheavier KK modes are bound-state resonances in the technicolor theory. The advantage of\nthe extra-dimensional formulation of these theories is that precision electroweak (and flavor)\nconstraints can be computed explicitly.\nHiggless models can also be related to gauge theories in four dimensions through dimensional deconstruction [310, 426, 427]. There we replace an extra dimension with a\none-dimensional lattice of four-dimensional gauge theories connected by bifundamental link\n72\n\n\ffields charged under nearest neighbor pairs. It is motivated by the analogy that a gauge\nsymmetry in five dimensions is similar to having an independent four-dimensional gauge\nsymmetry at each point along the extra dimension. Each of the bi-charged link fields has a\nnon-vanishing expectation value fi that breaks the adjacent groups down to a smaller subgroup. With varying fi along the lattice, this construction describes a latticized warped extra\ndimension with an overall gauge group given by the subgroup of the lattice left unbroken\nby the link VEVs. Not surprisingly, deconstructed four-dimensional Higgsless models [428\u2013\n431] face the same challenges from precision electroweak constraints [429, 432, 433] and the\ntop quark mass [434] as their five-dimensional counterparts. The collider phenomenology in\nthese scenarios is also similar to the five-dimensional RS-based constructions [418].\n3.\n\nHolographic composite models\n\nIn the standard RS models described previously, the Higgs is added to the theory by\nhand and is assumed to be confined to the IR brane. A more holistic approach within\nthe RS framework is to derive the Higgs from the fifth (A5 ) component of a bulk gauge\nfield [435\u2013441]. This occurs in holographic composite Higgs scenarios [442, 443]. In the dual\ninterpretation of these theories via AdS/CFT, the Higgs field emerges as a composite state\nthat is an approximate Nambu-Goldstone boson. For obvious reasons, these models are also\nsometimes called holographic NGB Higgs or gauge-unified Higgs scenarios.\nThe minimal viable holographic composite Higgs model is based on the RS spacetime\nwith a bulk electroweak gauge group SO(5) \u00d7 U (1)X [443]. The fifth dimension is bounded\nby a UV brane at z = R and an IR brane at z = R0 > R. Boundary conditions for\nthe bulk gauge fields are chosen so that on the UV brane the bulk gauge group is broken\ndown to the familiar SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y of the Standard Model with Y = (t3R + X), while\non the IR brane the remaining electroweak gauge symmetry is SO(4) \u00d7 U (1)X . This gauge\nstructure is similar to Higgless models. The important difference, however, is that the larger\ngroup SO(4) = SU (2)L \u00d7 SU (2)R is left unbroken on the IR brane, so that the electroweak\nSU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y gauge symmetry is unbroken everywhere.\nThe low-energy particle spectrum from this gauge structure consists of massless SU (2)L \u00d7\nU (1)Y gauge bosons prior to electroweak symmetry breaking, a collection of charged and\nneutral massive vector KK modes, and a complex scalar SU (2)L doublet localized towards\nthe IR brane. This doublet comes from the A5 components of the gauge fields corresponding\nto SO(5)/SO(4). Because the adjoint of SO(N ) has N (N \u2212 1)/2 elements, there are four\nreal broken generators in SO(5)/SO(4); just enough to make up a complex doublet. Recall\nthat in standard bulk RS and Higgless scenarios the A5 components of the gauge fields do\nnot lead to physical excitations. Here, those degrees of freedom from A5 which are not in\nSO(5)/SO(4) do not lead to physical excitations either.\nHowever, in general the presence or absence of a physical A5 mode depends on its boundary conditions. The boundary conditions for all the gauge fields in standard bulk RS and\nHiggsless models, as well as the non-SO(5)/SO(4) components in the holographic case, are\neither Dirichlet ( A5 = 0) on both branes or Dirichlet on one brane and Neumann on the\nother. The only solution in this case is A5 = 0. In the holographic case, for an appropriate\nchoice of gauge the bulk equation of motion for A5 is \u2202z2 (A5 /z) = 0 [351, 415]. Both boundary conditions for the A5 generators of SO(5)/SO(4) in this gauge are Neumann conditions\n\u2202z (A5 /z)|z=R,R0 = 0. These to allow for a profile A5 \u221d z \u221d ek|y| .\n73\n\n\fElectroweak symmetry breaking in holographic composite Higgs models is driven by the\ncomplex scalar doublet, which is identified with the Higgs field [443]. At tree level this\nfield has no potential at all, but loop corrections predominantly from the top quarks and\nelectroweak gauge bosons generated it. The absence of a classical potential is due to the\nfive-dimensional SO(5) gauge symmetry. To obtain a non-vanishing potential and induce\nelectroweak symmetry breaking, simultaneous SO(5)-breaking effects from both branes are\nrequired, because symmetry breaking at only one of the two branes does not lead to a\nphysical A5 mode. This non-local simultaneous symmetry breaking does not allow quadratic\ncorrections to the loop-generated potential, so the scale of electroweak symmetry is set by\nthe natural mass scale MKK = k e\u2212\u03c0 kR on the IR brane.\nThe origin of this scalar doublet can also be understood in terms of the four-dimensional\ndual theory suggested by the AdS/CFT correspondence [442, 443]. Under this correspondence, the bulk SO(5) gauge symmetry is interpreted as an approximate global symmetry\nof a strongly-coupled conformal field theory, with a weakly-coupled gauged SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y\nsubgroup. The explicit breaking of SO(5) down to SO(4) \u00d7 U (1)X on the IR brane corresponds to a spontaneous breaking of this symmetry by confining dynamics at the TeV\nscale (corresponding to the truncation of AdS5 by the IR brane). In this context, the\nHiggs doublet arises as a composite state that is an approximate NGB of the SO(5)/SO(4)\nglobal symmetry breaking. The advantage of the five-dimensional formulation is that the\ntheory is weakly coupled, allowing for a reliable calculation of the Higgs potential and the\nphenomenological constraints on the model.\nFermions in holographic composite Higgs models propagate in the bulk, and therefore\nhave to be embedded in full representations of the SO(5) bulk gauge symmetry [443, 444].\nOne of the simplest viable options for the Standard Model quarks is to put each left-handed\nquark doublet into a 5, each right-handed up singlet into a separate 5, and each right-handed\ndown singlet into a 10 [381, 447], where the 5 representation of SO(5) is the fundamental\nwhile the 10 is the adjoint. Since the Standard Model fermions only make up a fraction\nof these larger representations, the model also contains exotic quark states, which in this\ncase have electric charges 5/3, 2/3, \u22121/3. Boundary conditions for these fermions can be\nchosen so that only the Standard Model states have massless zero modes prior to electroweak\nsymmetry breaking.\nJust like in the standard bulk RS scenario, the masses of the zero mode fermions are\ngenerated by the expectation value of the Higgs field. Their precise values depend on the\noverlap of the fermion wave functions with the IR-localized Higgs profile. In turn, these\nwave functions are determined by explicit bulk and IR brane mass terms along with branelocalized kinetic terms [444, 447]. The first and second generation fermions can be made\nlight by arranging their wave functions to peak in the UV, while the third generation states\nshould be localized nearer to the IR brane.\nBeyond simple localization, the Higgs coupling to fermions is also restricted by the bulk\ngauge symmetry: since the Higgs consists of A5 components of a bulk gauge field, the\nunderlying Yukawa couplings are set by the gauge coupling. Gauge couplings only connect\nstates within the same representation of the gauge group, while the Standard Model fermions\nreside in different representations in the 5 \u2295 5 \u2295 10 embedding described above. However, a\nmixing between different multiplets is induced by the IR brane mass and kinetic terms, which\nneed only respect SO(4) \u00d7 U (1)X instead of the full SO(5) bulk gauge symmetry. Together,\nthe bulk masses and brane terms can give rise to an acceptable pattern of Standard Model\nfermion masses, provided we are willing to tune the model parameters accordingly.\n74\n\n\fAs usual, the most stringent current bounds on holographic Higgs scenarios come from\nprecision electroweak and flavor measurements. Both sets of constraints are very sensitive to\nthe localization of third generation bulk fermions. Most importantly, the one-loop potential\nfor the A5 Higgs doublet must spontaneously break the electroweak symmetry. This potential\ndepends primarily on the bulk electroweak gauge coupling, the IR brane scale, and the\nprofiles of the left- and right-handed top quarks [443]. Detailed analyses of the potential\nfind a range of parameters that lead to acceptable symmetry breaking [381, 447, 448].\nBut even with a reasonable electroweak vacuum, precision electroweak bounds further\nlimit the allowed model parameters. The most dangerous effect is is typically a too-large\nshift in the ZbL b\u0304L coupling. This can be fixed up by embedding the Standard Model quarks\ninto the 5 \u2295 5 \u2295 10 representations described above which leads to an enhanced custodial\nprotection [379], and by carefully arranging the QL3 and uR3 profiles. IR brane scales as low\nas MKK ' 1 TeV then turn out to be acceptable [380, 381, 447\u2013449].\nOf course, flavor is another problem. With generic flavor mixing parameters, an IR scale\nabove 20 TeV is found to be needed, even when localization is used to set the light quark\nmasses and reproduce the CKM mixing matrix [370, 450]. Lower IR scales are possible in\nrestricted parameter regions, or when we postulate an appropriate flavor symmetry, as we\nobserve it in the Standard Model.\nCollider signals in holographic composite Higgs models are often similar to the bulk RS\nscenario (as for example in [445]), though the Higgs itself may show significant deviations\nfrom SM behavior which may challenge conventional Higgs searches [75, 446]. The IR scale\ncan be low enough that KK modes of the gluon and electroweak gauge bosons are potentially\nobservable at the LHC. These states couple most strongly to the top quark states localized\nnear the IR brane, but only very weakly to the light fermions. The extended fermion\nrepresentations required to fill out SO(5) multiplets and satisfy electroweak constraints lead\nto exotic top-like quark states with charges 5/3, 2/3, \u22121/3 [381, 447]. In some parameter\nregions one or more of these heavy quarks can be lighter than 1 TeV [381, 447, 449]. These\nstates can be produced singly or in pairs, and they tend to decay primarily to top quarks\nand longitudinal W or Z gauge bosons, such as T5/3 \u2192 t W + . Final states with multiple\ngauge bosons can arise from the decay of one exotic to another when they are split in mass,\nT2/3 \u2192 T5/3 W \u2212 \u2192 t W + W \u2212 [447]. Heavy KK gluon states can have significant decays to\npairs of relatively light exotic quarks as well [449].\nF.\n\nHidden sector models\n\nAll the models we have described up to now are motivated by specific shortcomings of\nthe Standard Model, such as the instability of the electroweak scale or the failure to account\nfor the observed cosmology. These models lead to a very diverse set of collider signatures.\nHowever, it is entirely possible that new physics will turn up at the LHC that is different from\nwhat we have already thought of, or unrelated to the hierarchy or cosmological problems\nof the Standard Model. If we focus our search techniques too narrowly on specific models,\nthere is always a danger of missing the unexpected. For this reason it is useful to consider\npossibilities for phenomena that give rise to particularly unusual collider signatures or that\nmight be challenging to discover using standard search techniques.\nA very broad class new physics of this type falls into the paradigm of a hidden valley [451, 452]. As we will see, some of the models we have already discussed can be classified\n75\n\n\fas examples of hidden valleys. A generic hidden valley model consists of a visible sector\ncontaining the Standard Model, a hidden sector with suppressed couplings to the visible\nsector, and a set of heavy mediators that couple directly to both sectors.\nThis framework gives rise to a novel source of new signals at high energy colliders, which\nwe illustrate schematically in the left panel of Fig. 18. Collisions of Standard Model particles\ncreate mediator particles, which then decay some part of the time to the hidden sector. If\nthe hidden sector states are heavier than some of the Standard Model particles (for which\nthere is strong motivation from cosmology [453]), they can potentially decay back to the\nStandard Model. The decay products may be prompt or delayed and could have a large\nboost if the mediators are much heavier than the hidden states. Moreover, at energies well\nbelow the masses of the mediators, the mediators can be integrated out giving rise to new\nsuppressed and often higher-dimensional direct couplings between the visible and hidden\nsectors.\nThere is a great variety of hidden valley models and we do not have room to list all their\nsignatures, so we will restrict ourselves to a few simple examples. As a first example, consider\na situation where the Standard Model is the visible sector, the hidden sector consists of a\nSU (Nv ) (Nv > 2) non-Abelian gauge theory with two flavors of v-quarks and both sectors\nare charged under an exotic U (1)x gauge symmetry that is spontaneously broken near the\nTeV scale [451]. The massive U (1)x gauge boson Zx will act as a mediator between the\nvisible and hidden sectors. Even after applying the constraints from the LEP experiments,\nthe LHC production cross-section for v-quarks through an s-channel Zx can be significant.\nIn the hidden sector, the SU (Nv ) gauge theory with two flavors will confine at the energy\nscale \u039bv . If both flavors of v-quarks are lighter than \u039bv , direct v-quark production will\nlead to v-hadrons which decay in hidden-sector cascades down to the lightest v-pion. This\npion will in turn decay back to the Standard Model through an off-shell Zx with a strong\npreference for heavier flavors (due to chirality) such as bb\u0304 and tt\u0304 [451, 454]. If only one of the\ntwo v-quark flavors is lighter than \u039bv , there can also be decays from the hidden sector to the\nStandard Model that go to both light and heavy flavors [451]. In both cases the decays can\nbe prompt or displaced, and showering in the hidden sector can generate relatively spherical\nevents with a high particle multiplicity [455].\nA simple supersymmetric example of an hidden valley is described in Section II A 2, where\nthe visible sector is the MSSM and the hidden sector consists of a GeV-scale supersymmetric\nU (1)x Abelian Higgs model. In this case the mediator is not a specific particle, but rather\nthe kinetic mixing between the U (1)x and U (1)Y gauge groups. Such kinetic mixing can be\ninduced by massive states charged under both gauge groups, so this scenario can be thought\nof as a very heavy mediator sector. It is qualitatively different from the previous example\nbecause both the hidden and visible sectors share an R-parity symmetry. Supersymmetric\nproduction in the visible sector will lead to a cascade decay down to the lightest MSSM R-odd\nstate. This state will subsequently decay to the lighter hidden sector since R-parity forbids\nit from decaying further within the visible sector [452]. We illustrate the decay process\nschematically in the right panel of Fig. 18. The same qualitative behavior can also arise in\nany kind of scenario where the visible and hidden sectors share a discrete symmetry [452].\nAs a third and particularly unusual example of a hidden valley, we take the visible sector\nto be the Standard Model and the hidden sector to be a pure SU (Nv ) gauge theory. The\nmediator sector is a set of heavy fermions Q with mass mQ & 300 GeV that are charged\n76\n\n\f~\ng\n\nLHC\n\n~\nq\n\nLHC\nLSsP\n\nLEP\n\nhidden\nvalley\n\nhidden\nvalley\nLSvP\n\nSM\n\nSM\n\nFIG. 18: Schematic representation of hidden valley scenarios, from Ref. [452]. Left: standard\nsituation, where a massive mediator is produced and decays to the hidden valley, with the hidden\nvalley states decaying back to the Standard Model. Right: the hidden and visible sectors share a\ndiscrete symmetry, forcing some heavy visible states to decay to the hidden sector.\n\nunder both the Standard Model gauge groups and SU (Nv ). Let us assume further that\nthe confinement scale \u039bv of the SU (Nv ) gauge theory is significantly less than its fermion\nmasses, \u039bv \u001c mQ [345, 346, 452]. The mediator fermions in this case are sometimes called\nquirks, and the hidden sector consists of a spectrum of v-glueball states [345]. Loops of\nquirks generate an effective coupling between pairs of v-gluons and pairs of photons or\ngluons [345, 452]\ngSM gv\nSM 2\nv 2\n\u2212L \u2283\n(F\u03bc\u03bd\n) (F\u03b1\u03b2\n).\n(98)\n2\n2\n16\u03c0 mQ\nThis operator allows for a very slow decay of v-glueballs to the Standard Model with a decay\nlength on the order of\n\u0012\n\u00139 \u0010\n\u039b\nmQ \u00118\nc\u03c4 \u223c (10 m)\n.\n(99)\n50 GeV\nTeV\nThus, the v-glueballs tend to be stable on collider scales.\nAt the LHC quirk-antiquirk pairs will be produced directly through their couplings to\nthe Standard Model gauge bosons. Once created, the quirk and antiquirk will be connected\nby a tube of confining SU (Nv ) flux, much like the color connection between a quark and\nan antiquark in QCD [345]. In contrast to QCD, however, it is nearly impossible for this\nflux tube to break through the nucleation of a QQ\u0304 pair. Creating a pair of quirks from the\nvacuum takes an energy of about 2mQ , which is much larger than the typical reduction of\nthe flux tube energy of \u039b2v /mQ . The flux tube connecting the quirks can be modelled as a\nstring. Quirks produced at the LHC will have a typical kinetic energy on the order of mQ .\nThey will initially fly apart, but the string will pull them back together after stretching to\na maximal length on the order of\n\u0010 m \u0011 \u0012 100 eV \u00132\n\u0010 m \u0011 \u0012 10 GeV \u00132\nmQ\nQ\nQ\n= (1 fm)\n.\n(100)\nL \u223c 2 \u223c (10 m)\n\u039bv\nTeV\n\u039bv\nTeV\n\u039bv\nEach time the quirks are pulled back together there is a small probability for them to\nannihilate, but they will usually go through many oscillations before doing so [345].\n77\n\n\fThe qualitative collider signatures of quirks depend primarily on the length of the string\nconnecting them and their relative couplings to the SU (Nv ) and Standard Model gauge\nbosons [345]. Macroscopic strings (L & 10\u22123 m) can lead to a pair of quirk tracks with a\ndistinctive curvature in the r \u2212 z plane (where z is the beam axis). Quirks connected by\nmesoscopic strings with 10\u221210 m . L . 10\u22123 m cannot be individually resolved, but produce\na single track. Interactions of the quirk system with matter in the detector in this length\nregime can potentially prevent them from annihilating. Microscopic quirks (L . 10\u221210 m)\nwill oscillate rapidly, and emit soft pions, photons, and v-glueballs. This emission can reduce\nthe energy of the quirk-string system, allowing the string to shrink enough for the quirks to\nannihilate with close to zero kinetic energy. These decays can produce leptons or photons\nthat can be extracted from the backgrounds. Reconstructing the invariant mass of these\ndecay products will yield a peak at 2mQ . This peak can be potentially be correlated with a\ndistinctive pattern of QCD or electromagnetic radiation from the soft emission during the\nstring oscillation [345, 347].\nYet another class of hidden valley scenarios are unparticles [456, 457]. The hidden sector\nis assumed to be an approximately conformal field theory, without a characteristic mass\nscale. As such, the fields in the hidden sector do not have an obvious particle interpretation.\nCoupling the unparticle sector to the Standard Model through irrelevant higher dimensional\noperators can produce interesting phenomenological effects. For example, consider coupling\nan unparticle operator O(dU ) of mass dimension dU to fermions f and f 0 according to\n\u2212L \u2283\n\n1\nM dU \u22121\n\nf \u03040 f O(dU ) ,\n\n(101)\n\nwhere M is a large mass scale. This operator allows the decay f \u2192 f 0 + unparticles, provided\nf is heavier than f 0 . The characteristic feature of the invisible unparticle final state is that\nthe kinematic distribution of the outgoing f 0 fermion will correspond to the decay of f to\nf 0 and dU invisible particles [456]. What makes this slightly unusual is that dU need not be\nan integer.\nAlthough such an apparent non-integral number of final states might strange, a similar\nbehavior arises in QCD and QED [458, 459]. To understand the unparticle behavior, suppose\nwe add a very small mass term (or relevant operator) to the unparticle theory that breaks\nthe conformal symmetry at a very low energy [460]. As explained below, such a term is\ninevitable once the unparticles have relevant interactions with the SM. This breaking allows\nus to interpret the theory in terms of light particles. In a process whose characteristic energy\nis much larger than the unparticle sector mass, any amplitude involving an unparticle leg\nwill be significantly corrected at higher orders by the multiple emission of soft or collinear\nunparticle radiation. Similar corrections are present both in QCD and QED and are cut off\nby the characteristic mass scales, \u039bQCD or me [458, 459]. Unparticles differ primarily in that\nthe mass cutoff is taken to zero, so that the soft emissions never stop. Put another way, for\nan unparticle process, such as the decay to unparticles described above, the funny kinematic\ndistribution can be understood in terms of the repeated showering of unparticles.\nInteractions between the Standard Model and the unparticle sector (which are inevitable\nif unparticles are relevant at colliders) will lead to a breaking of conformality. For instance,\nunparticles can couple to the Higgs through the operator [460]\n\u2212L \u2283\n\n\u03bb\nM dU \u22122\n78\n\n|H|2 O(dU )\n\n(102)\n\n\fThis coupling generates a potentially relevant operator when the Higgs develops an expectation value (and may have an interesting back-reaction on the Higgs VEV [461] as well).\nAs a result, we generally expect a mass gap in unparticle models, and this can open up\ndecays back to the Standard Model as in hidden valley models [462]. The mediator sector\nresponsible for coupling unparticles to the Standard Model will also generate new higherdimensional operators involving only Standard Model fields. Constraints on such operators\noften imply that unparticle effects will be very difficult to observe, unless they acquire a\nmass gap and decay back to the Standard Model [463].\n\n79\n\n\fIII.\n\nSIGNATURES\n\nA wide and diverse collection of models have been put forward as candidates for new\nphysics beyond the Standard Model. These models give rise to an equally vast multitude of\nnew signals at the LHC. Both the ATLAS and CMS detectors have been designed as multipurpose instruments capable of measuring nearly the entire range of possibilities. They\nreconstruct particles coming from the proton-proton interaction point, determine their fourmomenta, and search for kinematic patterns which cannot be explained by the Standard\nModel. The great advantage of the LHC stems from its highly energetic proton beams.\nThey provide an enormous luminosity, a large density of gluons inside the protons at the\nrelevant energy scales, and a large coupling \u03b1s which governs the dominant production cross\nsections.\nThe greatest challenges for the LHC are closely connected with these advantages: any\nhigh-energy, high-luminosity proton\u2013proton collider will produce huge numbers of massless\nquark and gluon jets yielding too many events to even write to tape. Therefore we need to\ndetermine early on in the recording chain which kinds of events we would like to store and\nanalyze in detail. Among the subsets of events that are kept to be studied, signal events\nmust be extracted from samples often containing many more background events. For these\nreasons it is enormously useful to have concrete models of new physics to inform us of the\nmost promising directions for a new discovery. On the other hand, we have to ensure that we\ndo not weaken our experimental program due to a theoretical bias, for example by focussing\nonly on specific models.\nThe first step towards separating interesting signals from uninteresting background events\nis the trigger, which favors photons, leptons, heavy quarks, and missing energy \u2013 features\nwhich we expect from new-physics events. Even so, some models are particularly challenging\nfor the LHC triggers such as new strongly-interacting stable particles or the hidden\u2013valleys\ndescribed in Section II F. Fortunately, the ATLAS and CMS triggers are flexible, and can\nbe adjusted if we find interesting new features in the data. Note that triggers are much less\nof an issue at electron\u2013positron colliders which have a much cleaner environment, and are\nalso much less rigid at the Tevatron simply because of the comparatively smaller number of\nevents.\nThe second challenge is to distinguish new signals from background within the experimental resolution. To be able to say something about a final-state particle, it has to pass\nbasic acceptance cuts reflecting the geometry of the detector components. For the particles\nthat are accepted, we will likely have to study specific kinematic features to extract to extract an often relatively small number of new-physics events from the Standard Model, and\nQCD in particular, as we understand it. As an example, the LHC will produce roughly one\nmillion times as many two-jet events as top quarks, and still a factor 100 fewer light Higgs\nbosons. Even when an unexpected kinematic feature is seen, we will need to carefully rule\nout the possibility that we are simply seeing very rare manifestations of Standard Model\nphysics or unexpected detector effects before we can claim a discovery of new physics.\nIf a discovery is made, we will have to develop a strategy to identify the new physics\nthat is observed. The difficulty in doing so depends on what is seen: resonances decaying\nto pairs of leptons, photons, or jets are relatively easy to study; models involving a dark\nmatter candidate which leads to missing transverse energy in the detector are considerably\nharder; particles that decay to many light jets without an obvious resonance structure are\na serious challenge.\n80\n\n\fThese aspects of LHC detectors, Standard Model backgrounds, and the specific signatures\npredicted by theory will all have to be carefully considered in our quest for new physics.\nAn enormous asset for this is our expertise developed in Tevatron analyses, which have\nvery successfully circumvented most of these challenges, albeit in a more friendly QCD\nenvironment. In this section we will discuss LHC signals of new physics beyond the Standard\nModel, and we will describe how to go about measuring them. As much as possible, we\nwill present these signals in a general way without concentrating too much on any specific\nmodel. However, since studies of these signals often involve very specific questions, it is\nimpossible to answer them in a completely model-independent way. The frequent appearance\nof supersymmetry reflects a long history of physics sociology, but essentially all of the results\ncan be easily applied to other consistent TeV-scale completions of the Standard Model.\nA.\n\nQCD features of new particle production\n\nIf new physics at the TeV scale consists of a strongly and a weakly interacting sector, the\nstrongly-interacting particles will likely be produced at the LHC in much larger numbers.\nIn supersymmetry, for example, all the superpartner production rates have been calculated\nat next-to-leading order in QCD [87] and the weak coupling [464], and are shown in Fig. 19.\nStrongly interacting particles evidently have much larger production rates in most cases.\nParticles with masses up to several hundred GeV will be produced at rates around 10\u2013\n100 pb, corresponding to 104 \u2013105 events in the first 1 fb\u22121 of integrated luminosity. This\nnumber is the main feature of the LHC compared to the Tevatron - if such particles indeed\nexist we can do more than just produce them and observe a signal for physics beyond the\nStandard Model; we can also study their properties in their decays. To do so, it essential\nthat we understand the production processes involved, as well as the QCD backgrounds\nfrom the Standard Model. For pedagogical reviews of QCD processes at hadron colliders we\nrefer the reader to Refs. [9, 465].\nThe main tree\u2013level LHC production processes for strongly interacting states are determined almost entirely by their spins and color charges. New colored scalar particles most\noften arise as fundamentals (scalar quarks [39]) or adjoints (scalar octets [215, 216, 466\u2013\n468]) under SU (3)c , and couple to gluons correspondingly. The couplings to one or more\ngluons are related through gauge invariance. Their couplings to quarks need not be mediated by QCD at tree level, and can therefore be suppressed. Leptoquarks, as discussed in\nSection III C 5, are another example in this class, and from a production point of view are\nequivalent to squarks even though their decay channels can be much different.\nNew strongly-interacting fermions also arise most often as fundamental (heavy\nquarks [58]) or adjoint (gluinos [39] color representations. A color adjoint fermion can\nbe either Dirac or Majorana, since the adjoint of SU (N ) is a real representation. In the case\nof minimal (N = 1) supersymmetry, there is only a single color adjoint fermion gluino with\ntwo on-shell degrees of freedom to match those of the gluon, so the only possible mass term\nis Majorana. A supersymmetric Dirac gluino requires the introduction of a second color\nadjoint fermion and its scalar gluon superpartner (or sgluon [215]), either by extending the\namount of supersymmetry in the gauge sector (N = 2) [216] or as an ad-hoc modification of\nthe MSSM [466]. As discussed in Section II A 1, squarks and gluinos in the MSSM share a\nnew q-q\u0303-g\u0303 interaction which is proportional to the quark's color charge, and must be present\nfor the gauge interactions to be supersymmetric [86].\n81\n\n\fProspino2 (T Plehn)\n\n10\n\n3\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c3tot[pb]: pp \u2192 g\u0303g\u0303, q\u0303q\u0303, t\u03031t\u03031, \u03c7\u0303o2\u03c7\u0303+1, \u03bd\u0303\u03bd\u0303, \u03c7\u0303o2g\u0303, \u03c7\u0303o2q\u0303\n\n10 2\n\n\u2212\n\ng\u0303g\u0303\n\nt\u03031t\u03031\n\u2212\n\nq\u0303q\u0303\n\n10\n\u03c7\u0303o2q\u0303\n\n1\n\n10\n\n\u221aS = 14 TeV\n\n\u03c7\u0303o2\u03c7\u0303+1\n\u03c7\u0303o2g\u0303\n\n-1\n\nNLO\nLO\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03bd\u0303\u03bd\u0303\n\n10\n\nm [GeV]\n\n-2\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\n\u221a\nFIG. 19: LHC production cross sections for supersymmetric particles with s = 14 TeV. All rates\nare shown as a function of the average final-state mass. Figure from Ref. [87].\n\nLast but not least, strongly-interacting massive vector bosons with adjoint color charge\n(heavy gluons) arise in many models. Such new states are generically subject to strong\nexperimental constraints from flavor-changing neutral currents. These can be avoided by\nrequiring large heavy gluon masses or a discrete Z2 charge of new particles. This setup then\ndetermines whether a single heavy gluon can couple to Standard Model quarks and gluons or\nif there is only a three-particle vertex involving two heavy adjoint vectors and one Standard\nModel gluon.\nQCD couplings can also enter into loop-level or higher-dimensional operators that contribute to the production rates for new particles. This feature plays a very important role for\nthe rate of Higgs boson production at the LHC. In contrast, for states that are charged under\nthe color group such operators are typically much less important for production than the\ndirect coupling to gluons. Nevertheless, these operators can dominate the decay signatures\nwhen direct QCD-mediated decays are forbidden by phase space.\nTheories of new physics can sometimes produce gluon couplings to new stronglyinteracting states that are not flavor-diagonal. For example, supersymmetric squarks can\nmix between generations to produce non-diagonal q-q\u0303-g\u0303 coupling. An obvious question is\nwhether we can look for \"rare production processes\" at the LHC that involve flavor mixing,\nin analogy to rare decays in B physics. In most cases the answer appears to be negative due\nto the very strong constraints on new sources of flavor mixing associated with the gluon.\nEven considering modes enhanced by factors of 10\u2013100, such as Higgs or direct top production, it is not clear whether rare flavor-violating production channels are a promising path\nfor discovery [469\u2013471].\nWhen computing the production rates for new strongly-interacting heavy states at the\nLHC, QCD effects tend to spoil our theory predictions. First of all, even at high energy\nscales well above the W/Z mass the strong coupling \u03b1s is not small enough. This is not\n82\n\n\fimmediately obvious, since our fixed-order perturbation series can be organized in powers\nof \u03b1s \u223c 1/10 would suggest that unknown higher orders should lead to uncertainties in the\nfew\u2013percent range. Unfortunately, there can arise large infrared logarithmic enhancements\nto higher-order terms in the fixed order expansion that ruin its apparently rapid convergence.\nA historically well-known (but not quite devastating at the LHC) example of this commonly occurs if we produce two strongly interacting heavy states at once. One or many\ngluons can be exchanged between these two particles if they are moving slowly relative to\neach other. Since the steep energy dependence of the gluon density inside the proton pushes\nthe phase space for heavy particles towards the threshold region, this effect will be relevant\nat the LHC. In the limit of small relative velocity between the new states, the perturbative\nseries in \u03b1s gets dressed with logarithms of the form log(1 \u2212 4m2 /s) which diverge at threshold. In processes where these logarithms appear they need to be summed or re-summed,\ndepending on the philosophy and prior knowledge of the theorist involved. Such threshold\ncorrections are particularly dangerous if the leading-order amplitude\n\u221a vanishes at threshold\nwhile the next-to-leading-order amplitude has a finite limit for s \u2192 2m. In that case\nthe relative next-to-leading order corrections are formally infinite but integrable and are\ncorrectly described by a Sommerfeld form factor [472].\nA numerically more important effect for the LHC is the soft and collinear logarithms\nthat arise from gluons radiated off the incoming partons. When we integrate a scattering\namplitude (squared) over the phase space of a radiated gluon, the integrand diverges like\n1/pT of the massless final-state parton. Given a pT range, this behavior integrates to a\nmin\nlogarithm log(pmax\nT /pT ), where the upper end is regularized by the finite energy of the\nincoming partons. The lower integration limit can be arbitrarily small, implying that our\nperturbative series in \u03b1s gets spoiled by large logarithms of the kind log(m/pmin\nT ) with\nmin\nmax\npT \u2192 0. These logarithms can be (re-)summed, such that radiated jets below pT are no\nlonger part of the specific hard process and instead get absorbed into the parton densities\nof the inclusive process. For example, an n + 1 jet process with one low-pT gluon in the\nfinal state is replaced by a hard process with n jets where the soft gluon is incorporated\ninto the parton shower. The limiting value of pT below which a soft jet is incorporated into\nthe parton densities is called the factorization scale and evolves according to the DGLAP\nequation [9, 465]. Turning around this argument, parton showers should not be used to\nradiate jets harder than the hard (factorization) scale of the process, even though in practice\nthis used to be done by the standard Monte Carlos, and their results can often be tuned to\nagree with data.\nDue to this large logarithmic enhancement, we can deduce that jets with a transverse\nmomentum considerably smaller than the masses of the particles produced (i.e. the hard\nscale of the process) will be ubiquitous at the LHC. To understand QCD jets at the LHC\nit is therefore crucial that we describe properly the radiation of quarks and gluons in phase\nspace regions where the logarithm log(m/pT ) is small, as well as in regions where it becomes\nlarge and gets (re-)summed. Appropriate CKKW and MLM schemes that match between\nthese two regimes have been developed only recently and are now available as part of several\nMonte Carlo generators [473\u2013475].\nThe behavior of QCD jets in association with heavy new particles has been computed for\nsupersymmetric squarks and gluinos [476, 477] as well as for sgluons [215].

The matching scheme\napplied to the green shaded range is MLM [474]. Figure from Ref. [477].\n\nmomentum spectra for the two leading QCD jets. The different curves correspond to Monte\nCarlo simulations using Pythia [478], and an improved estimate using MLM matching. There\nare two features we observe. First, the two Pythia showers that use virtuality and transverse\nmomentum ordering of collinear jet radiation give consistent results within an error band\nwhich increases from 10% for soft jets to at best an order-of-magnitude for pT,j & mg\u0303 .\nThis widening is expected from the collinear approximation applied in the parton shower\napproach used in Pythia. The predictive power of an untuned shower vanishes once the\njet transverse momenta exceeds the hard scale of the process. The only reason why the jet\nradiation from the parton shower does not simply drop to zero is that they are tuned to\nexplain gauge boson and top pair production at the Tevatron, roughly probing the same\npartonic energy fraction as heavy gluinos at the LHC.\nWhen we instead consistently add all different leading-order n-jet rates, the result agrees\nwith the parton shower for small transverse momenta, where the results from such a matching\nprocedure actually rely on the parton shower. In addition, by definition it extrapolates\nsmoothly and reliably to very hard jets, described correctly by the matrix element. In\nbetween these two regimes the matching procedure has to be set up such that it produces\nsmooth jet distribution. The corresponding error band, however, should be taken as a lower\nlimit on the theory error - any leading-order prediction for LHC processes at the LHC\nshould not be expected to have a theory error below about 50% based on the typical size of\nperturbative QCD corrections.\nFrom the point of view of LHC phenomenology, Fig. 20 has a reassuring aspect: in the\ntypical range pT . 300 GeV where phase space still allows for an appreciable jet radiation\nprobability, the merged or matched results lie right in between the two Pythia curves [476,\n477]. We generally expect other showering codes such as Herwig to produce similar results,\npossibly with more relatively hard jets [479]. This means that for the production of heavy\nparticles we do not expect hard QCD activity to completely the spoil results obtained with\n(more recent) parton shower tunes. This simply reflects the fact that jets in the range of\npT,j . mheavy /2 accompanying the production of heavy states with mass mheavy are well\ncovered by the collinear approximation used in the parton showers.

We\nalso show the appropriately matched background prediction. Note that HT in the label does not\ncorrespond to our HT as defined in Eq.(109), but to our meff defined in Eq.(110). Figure from\nRef. [477].\n\nsuch as the W +jets background, the answer could be very different.\nA second example of the importance of jet matching can be seen by looking at the\ndistribution of the variable meff , which is defined as the sum of the transverse jet momenta\nplus the missing energy. This quantity acts as a measure of the mass of the heavy particles\nproduced, and we will discuss it in more detail in Section III B 1. In Fig. 21 we show the\ndistribution of meff for a particular MSSM spectrum. We see from this figure that consistently\nadding any number of hard jets to the final state slightly increases the over-all transverse\nenergy of the event. On the other hand, as suggested by the discussion above, the result is\nnot (far) outside the error band from the tuned parton shower simulation and just slightly\nhigher than the default virtuality-ordered Pythia shower. The signal distribution is clearly\ndifferent for the Standard Model background from W +jets background with its comparably\nlow hard scale.\nAs advertised many times, but not explicitly shown in Fig. 21, the shape of the HT\nor meff distributions for Standard Model backgrounds to new heavy particles shifts significantly [480]. The reason is that kinematic cuts only leave us with phase space regions where\njet radiation off gauge boson production is not at all described by a collinear parton shower.\nOur discussion of heavy new particles and QCD is largely independent of the identity\nof the new states, whether they are supersymmetric squarks and gluinos, scalars with an\nadjoint color charge, or massive vector gluon partners. In Fig. 22 we show the number\nof jets radiated in association with Standard Model top quarks and heavy scalar gluons\n(sgluons) with masses of 300 and 600 GeV. With increasing minimum transverse momentum,\nmost events with two 600 GeV sgluons also involve two, one, or zero jets from initial-state\nradiation. If we want to use jets from the decay of new particles for background rejection\nor for the construction of useful observables, it would probably be a good idea to limit\nourselves to jets with transverse momenta of at least 100 GeV. In contrast, jets from W/Z\ndecays or top quark decays are most likely in the 50 GeV range and will be subject to serious\n85\n\n\f1\n\n1\n\n\u2013\n\n10\n\n-1\n\npT > 30 GeV\n\n-2\n\nGG600 GeV\n\u2013\n\ntt\n\n10\n\njet radiation\npT > 50 GeV\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\nGG300 GeV\n\n-3\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n-2\n\nGG600 GeV\nGG300 GeV\n\u2013\n\n10\n0\n\njet radiation\npT > 100 GeV\n\n-1\n\nGG300 GeV\n\n-3\n\n8\nNjet\n\n10\n\nGG600 GeV\n\n\u2013\n\n10\n\n1/\u03c3tot d\u03c3/dNjet (tt/GG+jets)\n\n10\ntt\n\n10\n\n\u2013\n\n1/\u03c3tot d\u03c3/dNjet (tt/GG+jets)\n\njet radiation\n\n10\n\n1\n\n\u2013\n\n1/\u03c3tot d\u03c3/dNjet (tt/GG+jets)\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\ntt\n\n-3\n\n8\nNjet\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\nNjet\n\nFIG. 22: Number of jets produced in QCD jet radiation in addition to the sgluon or top decay\njets. We use MLM merging as implemented in MadEvent. Figure from Ref. [215].\n\ncombinatorial errors.\nAnother example of a potentially useful but very challenging observable at the LHC is the\nmomentum of a hadronically decaying top quark or a W boson coming from the resonant\nproduction of a new state: each of these decay jets will be in the 40\u201370 GeV range. Figs. 20\nand 22 indicate that this is precisely where we should expect several QCD jets to accompany\nthe hard production process, which will lead to a challenging combinatorial background.\nFor heavier gluino pair production, Ref. [481] shows how to get rid of this combinatorial\nbackground by extracting the (relevant) decay jets from the complete jet activity based on\nthe MT 2 variable defined in Eq. (113). Fig. 23 shows that a QCD jet from initial state\nradiation and its rapidity is strongly correlated with a jet extracted by a MT 2 criterion\ndescribed below. Note, however, that only jets above pT = 100 GeV are included in this\nanalysis, which limits the number of additional QCD jets to at most one. From Fig. 22 it\nis obvious that this procedure would be at the least considerably more challenging for jets\nfrom W decays with pT = 30\u201350 GeV.\nUp to this point in our discussion we have presented additional QCD jets as a problem to\nbe overcome. They can also be very useful. A prime example is in searching for direct QCD\ntop production through a flavor-violating vertex generated by new physics [470, 471, 482]\nug, cg \u2192 tg\n\n(effective q-t-g vertex).\n\n(103)\n\nThis process can be induced by the flavor structure of the general MSSM described in\nSection II A.

The background\nprocesses arise in part from bottom quarks in the initial state. Even though incoming\nbottom partons are not present in the proton as valence quarks, they can be generated by\n86\n\n\fFIG. 23: Left: rapidity distribution for quark (dashed) and gluon (dotted) radiation off gluino\npair production (mg\u0303 = 685 GeV) and the sum of the two (solid).

[481].\n\ngluon splitting for far off-shell gluons [483]. In this case we expect an additional far-forward\nbottom jet at large rapidities where flavor tags cannot be applied. While these bottom tags\nwould certainly help to disentangle these different top production mechanisms, we can try\nto do the same thing based only on QCD arguments without such flavor tags.\nThe variable of choice is the angle cos \u03b8\u2217 (P1 , P2 ). It parameterizes the angle between p~1\nin the rest frame of the P1 + P2 system and (~p1 + p~2 ) in the lab frame. It is not symmetric in\nthe arguments: if the two particles are back to back and |~p1 | > |~p2 | it approaches cos \u03b8\u2217 = 1,\nwhereas for |~p1 | < |~p2 | it becomes \u22121. In between, it vanishes in the case where p~1 in\nthe center of mass frame is orthogonal to the lab-frame momentum of this center-of-mass\nsystem. In Fig. 24 we see that s-channel and t-channel single top production and direct\nBSM top production have distinctively different jet distributions. While each distribution\nindividually is not sufficient to apply a kinematic cut, we should be able to train a neural\nnetwork to analyze these QCD features of jet radiation. Note that we have left out associated\nW t production at this stage since two of its jets should distinctively reconstruct a W mass\nand the third jet should be a forward bottom quark.\nAfter this long discussion of QCD features let us next turn to the real question for the\nLHC: what can we learn about new particles produced in hadronic pp collisions? Our first\nguess might be that if the LHC production cross section of new particles only depends on\ntheir masses, spins, and color representations, this production rate should be a very good\nobservable which could allow us to measure properties of new physics at the LHC early on\nand without detailed simulations of the particle decays.\nUnfortunately, the total production rate is not an easy observable at all, both theoretically\nas well as experimentally. First, we hardly ever measure the actual production cross section.\nWhile we can of course formulate an exclusion limit for a new particle based on its production\nrate under the explicit assumption that it only decays to a single final state, this is not very\nlikely in models as complex as the MSSM. Therefore, we have to analyze the products of cross\nsections and branching ratios assuming we see only few allowed final states.

Figure from Ref. [471].\n\nfor a feasible analysis is the squark cascade and its relative branching ratios to e + \u03bc and \u03c4\nleptons, which contain useful information about the stau sector [484]. One notable exception\nis the top squark in the MSSM with minimal flavor violation which, with increasing mass,\nfirst decays dominantly through loop-induced amplitudes to charm-neutralino, then goes\non-shell to bottom-chargino through its weak charge, and finally to top-gluino via its color\ncharge [485].\nSecondly, we know from the discussion above that higher-order corrections to QCD cross\nsections are by no means of the order \u03b1s \u223c 1/10, possibly suppressed by additional factors\nof 1/\u03c0. Collinear logarithms lead to next-to-leading-order corrections of typically 30\u201380%,\ndepending on the color charges of the initial state and the produced particle [87, 486].\nEven for weakly interacting Drell-Yan-type processes like neutralino-chargino production,\nwe observe corrections of the order of 30%. For production processes which are at the\nleading order proportional to \u03b1s2 , the theoretical uncertainty due to higher-order corrections\nis roughly covered by the variation of the renormalization and factorization scales. The\nargument for this error measure is simply that these scales are artifacts of perturbative\nQCD, meaning that to all orders in perturbation theory the scale dependence should vanish.\nHowever, for leading-order processes going like \u03b12 this error estimate undershoots the known\nhigher-order corrections by large factors. In this situation it is not only crucial to know the\ntheory error on a cross section prediction, but to actually use the higher-order results [87,\n486].\nFor convoluted spectra like the squarks and gluinos in the MSSM or similarly heavy quarks\nand gluons in universal extra dimensions we face another challenge: the list of production\n88\n\n\fprocesses includes q\u0303 q\u0303 and q\u0303 q\u0303 \u2217 production, gluino pairs g\u0303g\u0303 and last but not least the associated\nq\u0303g\u0303 process. These processes can only be distinguished by the number of jets in the final state.\nThe mixed associated production has a quark-gluon initial state which is particularly wellsuited for the production of heavy states at the LHC: while valence quarks dominate the\nlarge-x region of the available partonic energy, for smaller x < 0.01 the gluon densities\npractically explode. In general, for heavy states the mixed qg initial state turns out to be\nthe best compromise for average x values around 0.1, which means that heavy associated\nproduction processes typically dominate over heavy pair production processes.\nB.\n\nMissing energy\n\nMany theories of physics beyond the Standard Model predict the existence of quasi-stable\nneutral particles. When created in particle colliders, they will leave the detector without\ngenerating a direct signal. Instead, they can make their presence felt indirectly by producing\nan imbalance in the vector sum of the visible transverse particle momenta in the event,\nX\nX\np~Tmiss =\np~Ti = \u2212\np~Tj .\n(105)\ninvisible\n\nvisible\n\nThis missing energy is a useful tool for separating signals from Standard Model backgrounds,\nbut it also makes life more difficult when it comes to measuring the detailed particle properties underlying these signals. Note that this formula can be used at the theory level,\nbut taking into account detector effects it is a bad approximation to the missing energy\nresolution at the LHC.\nThere are two primary reasons why quasi-stable particles are nearly ubiquitous in models\nof new physics. First, an exactly stable neutral particle with a weak-scale mass and electroweak couplings can potentially make up the dark matter in our universe. The stability of\nsuch a state simply requires some sort of Z2 parity symmetry under which it is the lightest\nodd state. Secondly, by extending such a parity symmetry to the entire theory, the precision electroweak and flavor constraints on new physics that is parity-odd are significantly\nweakened, even when the parity is only approximate. Specific examples of theories with a\nglobal parity symmetry include supersymmetry with R-parity, universal extra dimensions\nwith KK-parity, and little Higgs models with T -parity. It is precisely on account of their\nparity symmetries that the new particles in these theories can be as light as a few hundred\nGeV while remaining consistent with current experimental constraints.\nIn theories with a parity symmetry that extends to the entire theory, there are typically\nheavy new QCD-interacting states with odd parity. These will be produced in pairs in\nlarge quantities at the LHC. Each of them will decay in a cascade down to the lightest\nparity-odd particle, which will escape the detector if it is neutral. The decay process will\ntherefore involve two possibly distinct decay chains \u2013 one for each parity-odd heavy QCD\nstate created in the initial collision. Along the way, the color charge of the initially-produced\nstates must be shed by emitting Standard Model quarks and gluons, so the resulting events\nare characterized by a high jet multiplicity and large missing transverse energy. Moreover,\nthese heavy particle decays are expected to be more spherical on average than the QCD\nbackgrounds. A simple example of such a cascade in supersymmetry is illustrated in Fig. 25,\nwhere a pair of gluinos is produced that decay down to the stable neutralino LSP by emitting\nquarks. Such a process will produce a net signal consisting of jets and missing energy.\n89\n\n\fq\n~\ng\n\ng\ng\n\nq\n~\nq\n\n~\n\u03c701\n\n~\nq'\n\n~\n\u03c701\n\n~\ng\ng\n\nq'\n\nq'\n\nFIG. 25: Supersymmetric cascade decay with a neutralino LSP. Two gluinos are produced in the\ninitial interaction, and each subsequently decays down to the neutralino LSP by emitting quarks.\n\nSignals of missing energy can also appear in models of new physics that do not have any\nsort of parity, but that contain neutral states that are long-lived due to very weak couplings\nor kinematics. This is the case for the light Kaluza-Klein graviton excitations in theories\nwith large extra dimensions.\nMissing energy is an extremely powerful tool to extract new signals from Standard Model\nbackgrounds. There are, however, detector and Standard Model sources of missing energy as\nwell. On the detector side, a momentum imbalance can be generated by a mis-measurement\nof energy in the detector, typically from QCD events. Controlling such backgrounds will\nrequire careful studies of the detector performance based on collision data and a minimum of\nseveral months of work. The second source of backgrounds are events with genuine missing\nenergy from neutrinos produced by Standard Model processes involving W and Z bosons,\nsuch as (Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd)+jets or t\u0304t production where the latter even has a high jet multiplicity.\nAgain, collider data will be essential to understanding these backgrounds: Z \u2192 `+ `\u2212 can\nbe used to determine the rate for Z \u2192 \u03bd\u0304\u03bd, and fully reconstructed tt\u0304 events provide the top\nproduction rate. Since we will need sufficient statistics to accurately predict missing energy\nbackground rates from the Standard Model and detector effects, the amount of time required\nto claim a discovery of new physics through missing energy could well be dominated by the\ncollection of these control samples, and not by signal statistics.\nIn the remainder of this section we will discuss signals of missing energy from cascade decays in models with a parity symmetry, as well as the direct production of long-lived neutral\nstates. We will also describe techniques to measure the underlying physics giving rise to the\nmissing energy. To do so, it is necessary to use kinematic distributions sensitive to new heavy\nparticles that are perturbatively well-behaved. The major question is whether we can use\ndecay kinematics in the presence of an invisible final state particle, without reconstructing\neither the (partonic) initial state or the final state. For example, in supersymmetry or universal extra dimensions, any extraction of model parameters (to be discussed in Section IV)\nhinges on the identification and isolation of complete new-physics decay chains. Only then\ncan we hope to measure the kinematic properties of the decay products and extract masses\nand couplings of the new states, which is the main task of the LHC once new physics is\ndiscovered at the TeV scale.\n\n90\n\n\f1.\n\nCascade decays\n\nIn this subsection we will focus on the detection and measurement of new physics scenarios with a parity symmetry. We will assume further that a fraction of the new particles are\nodd under the parity, including some carrying QCD charges, and that the lightest parity-odd\nstate is neutral and stable on collider time scales. New parity-odd states will be therefore be\nproduced in pairs and decay through a cascade down to the lightest parity-odd state, generating a signal of missing energy. While these assumptions are specific, they cover some of\nthe most popular theories for physics beyond the Standard Model including supersymmetry\nwith R-parity and some little Higgs and extra-dimensional scenarios.\nAs discussed in Section III A and illustrated in Fig. 19, the production of stronglyinteracting states is dominant at hadron colliders. Thus, the great majority of decay chains\nwill begin with pairs of QCD-charged states. This is especially true at the LHC, since the\nx values of the incoming partons dominating the production are below 10\u22122 where protons\nconsist mostly of gluons. Since production through electroweak interactions requires quarks\nin the initial state, it is not clear whether this will be relevant for LHC searches. Note that\nthe situation can be different at the Tevatron with its lower collision energy where incoming\ngluons are less likely to dominate the parton luminosities.\nDecay cascades further illustrate the primary advantages and challenges of the LHC.\nStarting from a pair of parity-odd strongly-interacting particles, produced for example in\ngluon fusion, they will decay down to the weakly-interacting lightest parity-odd state. The\ndifferent decay steps are ideally two-body decays from on-shell particle to on-shell particle,\nbut they may also involve off-shell intermediate states. The huge luminosity of the LHC can\nyield very high production rates: strongly interacting particles with masses around 500 GeV\nhave production cross sections close to O(100 pb) and the LHC will create 105 of them\nwithin the first 1 fb\u22121 of data. The price for this luminosity is that these events will be\naccompanied by a large number of jets, both as part of the new physics process or from\nthe underlying event. Decay products containing leptons or b-jets can be separated more\nreliably.\nIt is useful to organize inclusive missing energy signatures at the LHC and the Tevatron\naccording to the number of hard leptons in the event. The standard classification is [79,\n487, 488]:\nETmiss + jets + X: inclusive jets plus missing energy (X = anything)\nETmiss + jets + 0`: lepton veto (0`)\nETmiss + jets + 1`: one lepton (1`)\nETmiss + jets + 2` with Q(`1 ) = \u2212Q(`2 ): opposite-sign dileptons (2` OS)\nETmiss + jets + 2` with Q(`1 ) = +Q(`2 ): same-sign dileptons (2` SS)\nETmiss + jets + 3`: trileptons (3`)\nSignatures can be further classified according to additional features, such as the number\nb-tags or the flavor of the outgoing leptons [489].\nThe discovery reach of the LHC and the Tevatron is maximized by combining all these\nsignature channels. In typical supersymmetric models, the optimal strategy involves a cut on\n91\n\n\fm1/2 [GeV]\n\n1000\n\n\u223c\n\u03c41 LSP\n\nATLAS\n\n~\ng (2.0 TeV)\n\n5 \u03c3 discovery\nMSUGRA tan \u03b2 = 10\n\n4 jets 0 lepton\n4 jets 1 lepton\n4 jets 2 leptons OS\n1 jet 3 leptons\n\n800\n~\ng (1.5 TeV)\n\n~\nq (2.5 TeV)\n\n600\n\n~\nq (2.0 TeV)\n~\nq (1.5 TeV)\n\n~\ng (1.0 TeV)\n\n400\n\n200\n\n~\nq (1.0 TeV)\n\n~\ng (0.5 TeV)\n~\nq (0.5 TeV)\n\n\u223c+\n\u03c7 (103 GeV)\n1\n\n0\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\nNO EWSB\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n3000\n\nm0 [GeV]\nFIG. 26: ATLAS 5\u03c3 reach in various inclusive channels presented in the mSUGRA (toy) mass\nplane. We assume a low integrated luminosity of 1 fb\u22121 [80].\n\nETmiss of a few hundred GeV. In this case the reach is dominated by the inclusive ETmiss +jets\nsearch, but the other channels can be reasonably sensitive as well and would help to confirm\na discovery based on the fully inclusive signature. The reach of some of these\n\u221a channels we\nillustrate in Fig. 26. For example, the approximate LHC discovery reach at s = 14 TeV is\nabout 1.3 TeV in squark/gluino masses for an assumed luminosity of 1 fb\u22121 . This number\nincludes systematic errors on the background evaluation for the same luminosity. One year of\ndesign luminosity, or 100 fb\u22121 , would increase the mass reach to 2.5\u20133 TeV and is limited by\nthe signal cross section dropping sharply for high masses. While these results were obtained\nfor \"typical\" supersymmetric models with squarks and gluinos of comparable mass, similar\nresults should apply to any model with strongly-interacting parity\u2013odd states decaying to a\nstable lightest parity-odd state [490]. Let us emphasize, however, that these signals will often\nbe buried in a significant standard model background, and any discovery will be limited by\nour theoretical and experimental understanding of these backgrounds.\nBeyond just making a discovery, we would also like to learn about the physics giving\nrise to any anomalous signals that are found. A first step in this program is to compare\nthe relative event rates from different signal channels. While this doesn't provide enough\ninformation to deduce the source of the signals, it is very useful in narrowing down the\npossibilities. To do significantly better, it is necessary to study kinematic distributions of\nthe signal decay products, and for this we must identify specific kinematic properties that are\nnot ruined by the fact that we are not able to directly reconstruct the individual momenta\nof the pair of outgoing invisible particles.\nTo get an idea of which kinematic distributions might be useful for the identification and\nmeasurement of new physics models with missing energy signatures, it is helpful to look at\nStandard Model processes that also contain missing energy. Examples that have already\nbeen measured or studied in detail include W +jets, Higgs boson decays to W pairs, and\nsingle top production. These channels all include genuine missing energy from neutrinos\n92\n\n\fwhen the relevant W s decay leptonically: W \u2212 \u2192 `\u03bd\u0304` .\nIn W + jets production we know how to reconstruct the mass of a leptonically decaying\nW , decaying into one observed particle (lepton) and one missing particle (neutrino). A\nuseful quantity for this is the transverse mass, defined in analogy to the invariant mass of\ntwo particles m2ab \u2261 (pa + pb )2 , but neglecting the longitudinal components of the final state\nmomenta [491]:\n\u00012\n\u00012\nm2T = ETmiss + ET,` \u2212 p~Tmiss + p~T,`\n\u0001\n(106)\n= m2miss + m2` + 2 ET,` ETmiss \u2212 p~T,` * p~Tmiss ,\nwhere mmiss ' 0 is the mass of the invisible neutrino and the transverse energy is defined to\nbe ET2 = p~2T + m2 . The transverse mass is always less than or equal to the actual W mass,\nso we can extract mW from the upper edge of the mT,W distribution. Obviously, we can\ndefine the transverse mass in many different reference frames. However, its value is invariant\nunder (independent of) longitudinal boosts, and given that we construct it as the transverse\nprojection of an invariant mass it is also invariant under transverse boosts. Note that the\ntransverse mass does give the W mass from any single event, but requires a large number\nof events to populate the upper end of the distribution.\nFrom studies of Higgs searches we know how to extend the transverse mass to a pair of\nleptonically decaying W bosons, W + W \u2212 \u2192 `+ `0\u2212 \u03bd` \u03bd\u0304`0 , which contains two invisible neutrinos\nin the final state. In this case, a transverse mass can again be defined, but now using\nthe transverse components of the sum of the visible lepton momenta, p`` = p` + p`0 \u2261\n(E`` , p~`` ) [492, 493]:\n\u00012\n\u00012\nm2T,W W = ETmiss + ET,`` \u2212 p~Tmiss + p~T,``\n\u0001\n= m2miss + m2`` + 2 ET,`` ETmiss \u2212 p~T,`` * p~Tmiss .\n(107)\nThis definition is not unique since it is not clear how to define mmiss , which also implicitly\nenters through ETmiss . From Monte-Carlo analyses it is found that identifying mmiss \u2261 m`` ,\nwhich is correct at threshold, is the most strongly peaked [493]. On the other hand, setting\nmmiss = 0 for a proper bounded-from-above transverse mass variable seems to improve the\nHiggs mass extraction [494].\nInvestigations of single top production have led to another method for conditionally\nreconstructing masses and momenta in the presence of a single invisible particle. When\n \u0304 ` , the longitudinal momentum of the neutrino is not directly\nt \u2192 bW + with W + \u2192 `\u03bd\nmeasurable. On the other hand, we know that for signal events the neutrino and the lepton\ncombine to an on-shell W boson, (p` + p\u03bd )2 = m2W . This constraint allows us to deduce the\nlongitudinal momentum of the invisible particle (the neutrino) if make an assumption for its\nmass; m\u03bd ' 0 in this case. The main difference between such a conditional reconstruction\nand a direct momentum reconstruction is that we must use a global measurement like p~Tmiss ,\nwhich uses the entire detector, instead of simply reconstructing the momentum of a single\ntrack.\nA third and more global class of observables can be useful in the presence of several\nleptonic W decays. They are based on the assumption that we are looking for the decay of\ntwo heavy non-relativistic new states that are produced close to threshold, which is likely\ndue\n\u221a to falling parton densities. We can then approximate the partonic collision energy as\n\u015d \u223c (m1 + m2 ) and relate it to an observable based on the total amount of visible energy\nin the event. Since we assume that the heavy states are produced with little energy, boost\n93\n\n\finvariance is not required for these constructions. Without taking into account sources of\nmissing energy, such an observable could take the form [495]\n\"\n#2 \"\n#2\nX\nX\nE \u2212\np~\n(108)\nm2visible =\n`,j\n\n`,j\n\nThe Tevatron experiments have frequently used another variable in this class: the transverse\nmass scale HT ,\nX\nX\nHT =\nETi =\npTi\n(109)\ni\n\ni\n\nwhere the last step assumes that all final state particles are massless. This has traditionally\nbeen evaluated using jet momenta only, but it can trivially be extended to leptons. If\nthe signal originates from a pair of non-relativistic heavy states and there is not too much\nmissing energy in the event, we expect that mvisible \u223c HT \u223c (m1 + m2 ).\nMore generally, we would like to include missing transverse momentum into such a measure. This leads to the question of whether it is better to combine the missing transverse\nmomentum with the visible transverse momenta, or with the complete visible momenta. For\nexample, we can use the scalar sum of all transverse momenta in the event, now including\nthe missing transverse momentum, to stay longitudinally boost invariant:\nmeff = ETmiss + HT\n\n(110)\n\nThis effective mass is known to trace well the mass of the heavy new particles decaying to jets\nand missing energy [496]. We should add that the definition of global variables is not entirely\nunique. For example, in many references HT is defined as HT = ET2 + ET3 + ET4 + ETmiss .\nIn practice, there are two potential problems with the meff variable. The first is that it\nonly tracks the masses of the initially produced states to the extent that these are produced\nnon-relativistically. Second, some of the jets included in forming HT may not actually come\nfrom the signal decay chains, but originate instead as hard associated jets as discussed in\nSection III A. There is also a danger of picking up jets from the underlying event, and for\nthis the jets used in HT and in the other methods discussed in this section should be narrow\nand well-defined [497]. Ways to deal with QCD activity like the underlying event will be\ndiscussed in detail in Section III B 2.\nThese techniques to reconstruct invariant masses can also be enhanced by focussing on\ncertain kinematic configurations rather than on different events. A classic example is the\napproximate collinear reconstruction of a heavy particle such as a Higgs decaying to boosted\ntau pairs [199, 498], where all the decay products of each \u03c4 are assumed to travel in the same\ndirection. Another set of useful phase space regions is the vicinity of kinematic endpoints,\nwhere individual particles are produced at rest [79].\nThe methods described above that were developed for Standard Model processes can be\nadapted to new physics searches once we specify the relevant signatures. Most importantly,\nthe approach to missing energy needs to be modified to account for the unknown finite mass\nof the carrier of the missing energy, and for the possibility of various lengths and varieties\nof decay chains. This represents a problem of relativistic kinematics and at least at leading\norder does not require a detailed knowledge of QCD or new-physics models [488]. Proposals\nto solve this problem can be broadly classified into three classes.\n94\n\n\f1. Endpoint methods extract masses from lower (threshold) and upper (edge) kinematic\nendpoints of invariant mass distributions of visible decay products [79, 488, 499\u2013502].\nThese endpoints correspond to functions of the particle masses involved in the cascades.\nThis method is best suited to long decay chains, where the number of independent\nendpoint measurements in one of the legs of the cascade is at least as large as the\nnumber of unknown masses in that leg.\nFor this method to work we need to either clearly separate the decays of two heavy\nnew states, or combine a short decay chain on one side with a long chain on the other\nside. In supersymmetry, this is often naturally the case for associated q\u0303R g\u0303 production\n(with q\u0303R \u2192 q\u03c701 and g\u0303 decaying in a longer chain), but such a feature is not generic.\nMoreover, when looking at long cascade decays we usually cannot tell where along\nthe chain a given final state was emitted. For example, in a cascade chain where two\nleptons are emitted, it can be difficult to determine which lepton was emitted earlier\nin the cascade. Endpoint techniques will therefore always be plagued by combinatoric\nuncertainties from the mapping of particle momenta onto the decay topology. In this\nsituation it is useful to consider the correlation of different invariant masses and their\nendpoints [503]. The endpoint method can be extended to use invariant mass distributions from both sides of the event (hidden threshold techniques), and correlations\nbetween the distributions from each leg (wedgebox techniques) [504].\nA general caveat for these endpoint techniques is that they can only be applied to a\ndistribution of many events, just like for the transverse mass reconstruction discussed\nabove. Evidently, a sufficiently large number of events is required to fill out the region\nnear the endpoint. This can be problematic when the matrix element describing\nthe decay becomes suppressed in the kinematic region near the endpoint. Endpoints\nvanishing smoothly in the Standard Model background noise are unlikely to be useful\nfor mass determination.\n2. Mass relation methods generalize the single-top example to completely reconstruct the\nkinematics with only a few events, assuming that all the decaying particles are onshell. This assumption is also implicit in the endpoint method, but off-shell effects are\nnot expected to have a huge effect on the results.\nFor each event with the topology Z \u2192 Y \u2192 X \u2192 N , as illustrated in the left panel\nof Fig. 27, and where N crosses the detector invisibly, this method uses the kinematic\nconstraints [505]\n(p1 + p2 + p3 + pmiss )2 =m2Z\n(p2 + p3 + pmiss )2 =m2Y\n(p3 + pmiss )2 =m2X\n(pmiss )2 =m2N\n\n(111)\n\nWhile for any one event the number of free parameters can be larger than the number\nof measurements, using several events increases the number of measurements while\nkeeping the number of unknowns constant. Eventually, the system of equations for\nthe masses will be solvable, provided all events are really signal events. This technique\ncan be generalized to either identical or different legs in the pair of cascade chains or\nto to different decay chain lengths.\n95\n\n\f1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n8\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nFIG. 27: Best-fit values for all masses involved in squark decays in the supersymmetric parameter\npoint SPS1a. Each of the 100 points is extracted from a sample of 25 events. The momenta include\na 10% simulated detector smearing. Figures from Ref. [505]\n\nThe only unknown in Eq.(111) aside from the four masses is the missing momentum vector pmiss . Under a given mass hypothesis {mi } = {mZ , mY , mX , mN } we can\ncompute pmiss from all other measured momenta; this matrix relation for the missing\nmomentum is a sparse matrix and can be inverted. The goodness of the mass hypothesis can then be checked by testing the self-consistency condition (pmiss )2 = m2N .\nThe structure of Eq.(111) implies that this condition does not only test the last mass\ncondition but all of them iteratively. More precisely, for a given sample of events (or\nsets of measured momenta) we can minimize over the space of hypothetical particle\nmasses {mi } a quantity of the form\nX \u0002\n\u00032\n\u03be 2 ({mj }) =\n(pmiss )2n \u2212 m2N .\n(112)\nevents n\n\nIn the right panel of Fig. 27 we illustrate a mass extraction with this technique based\non a sample of 25 events for the MSSM SPS1a parameter point. Even after including\nthe leading detector smearing effects, all the relevant masses in the decay chain can\nbe determined to within about 10%.\nThis mass relation method has been developed to address single legs [506]. Using both\nlegs allows us to consider two decays at a time and to include the missing transverse\nenergy as another measurement [506, 507]. It has also been successfully applied as a\nhybrid, combining mass relations and kinematic endpoints [508].\n3. MT 2 methods used for two one-step decay chains per event are based on a global\nvariable MT 2 [509]. It generalizes the transverse mass developed for W decays to the\ncase of two massive invisible particles, one from each leg of the event. The observed\nmissing energy in the event can be divided into two scalar fractions, p~Tmiss = /q 1 + /q 2 .\nGiven the two fractions /q j we can construct a transverse mass for each side of the\nevent assuming we know the invisible particle's mass, mT,j (q/j ; mmiss ), where the second\nargument represents our external assumption. Inspired by the usual transverse mass,\nwe would like to incorporate this into a mass variable with a well-defined upper edge,\n96\n\n\fso we need to use some kind of minimum of the mT,j as a function of the splitting\nof p~Tmiss . Without any additional constraints, this minimum will occur with zero\ntransverse momentum on one leg, which is not very interesting. However, in this limit\nthe transverse mass from the other leg reaches a maximum, so we can instead define\nthe quantity\n\u0014\n\u0015\nMT 2 (mmiss ) =\nmin\nmax mT,j (q/j ; mmiss )\n(113)\np\n~Tmiss =/\nq1 +/q2 j\nas a function of the unknown missing particle mass. By construction, each of the\nmT,j lie between the sum of the masses of the two decay products and the mass of\nthe decaying particle, so for massless Standard Model decay products there will be a\nglobal MT 2 threshold at the missing particle's mass. Moreover, for the correct value\nof mmiss , the MT 2 distribution has a sharp edge at the mass of the parent particle.\nThis means that in favorable cases MT 2 may allow the measurement of the masses of\nboth the parent particle and the lighter stable particle based on a single-step decay\nchain [508, 510\u2013513].\nAn interesting aspect of MT 2 is that it is trivially boost invariant if mmiss is indeed\nthe mass of the missing particle. In contrast, for a wrong assignment of mmiss it has\nnothing to do with the actual kinematics and hence with any kind of invariants, which\nmeans it will not be boost invariant. This aspect can be exploited by scanning over\nmmiss and looking for so-called kinks, i.e. points where different events kinematics all\nreturn the same value for MT 2 . [512]\nSimilar to the more global meff variable, we can generalize MT 2 to the case where we\ndo not have a clear assignment of the two decay chains involved. This modification\nMT textGen [510] again has an upper edge, which unfortunately is not quite as sharp\nas the one in MT 2 . This procedure can be further generalized to any one-step decay,\nfor example a three-body decay with either one or two missing particles on each side\nof the event. Such MT X distributions are useful as long as they have a sharp enough\nedge. This can become a problem in some cases, such as when looking at the MT 4\ndistribution for decays with two heavy invisible particles and two neutrinos in the final\nstate.\nBeyond just mass reconstruction, MT 2 can also be used to disentangle central jets from\nheavy particle decays from forward initial-state jet radiation [481], a problem discussed\nin Section III A. The situation for hard jets with pT,j > 100 GeV is illustrated by the\nleft panel in Fig. 23, where we see that a simple cut on the jet rapidity is not enough\nto extract a sample with purely decays jets. Instead, an unwanted QCD jet can be\neliminated by constructing a set of reduced MT 2 variables,\n(j)\n\nMTmin\n2 = min MT 2 \u2261 min MT 2 (p1 , ..., pj\u22121 , pj+1 , ...),\nj\n\nj\n\n(114)\n\nwhere the definition of MT 2 might have to be adapted to the number of decay jets\n(j)\nexpected. We then search for the value j with the smallest MT 2 . By construction,\ncombinations of decay jets will tend to produce a non-zero value in the minimization\nprocedure constructing MT 2 . In contrast, QCD jets are uncorrelated and will drive\nMT 2 to zero. This correlation is shown in the right panel of Fig. 23 where we find that\nfor sufficiently forward jets MTmin\n2 strongly correlates with the QCD jet in the sample.\n97\n\n\f~\nq\n\nq\n\nl\n\n~\n\u03c702\n\n~\nl\n\nq\n\nl\n~\n\u03c701\n\nQ\n\n(1)\n\nZ\n\n(1)\n\nl\n\nl\n\n(1)\n\nl\n\u03b3\n\nFIG. 28: The long squark decay chain in supersymmetry (left) and the long the KK quark decay\nchain in UED (right) described in the text around Eq. (116).\n\nA slight variation to the usual definition of the transverse mass is the co-transverse\nmass, which is designed to cancel any smearing due to the transverse momentum of\nthe heavy decaying particle. For two identical decaying particles with short decay\nchains like in the W W or MT 2 scenario, we can instead use [508]\nm2CT = (ET,`1 + ET,`2 )2 \u2212 (~pT,`1 \u2212 p~T,`1 )2\n= m2`1 + m2`2 + 2 (ET,`1 ET,`2 + p~T,`1 * p~T,`2 ) <\n\nm2heavy \u2212 m2miss\nm2heavy\n\n(115)\n\nWhile it is not invariant under transverse boosts anymore it still retains the endpoint\nand sharpens its drop by cancelling part of the transverse momentum dependence on\nboth sides.\nA generic feature of all three of these methods based on decay kinematics is that it is\neasier to constrain the differences of masses than to determine the absolute mass scale.\nThis is particularly true for endpoint methods, since the formulas for the endpoints involve\ndepend on squared mass differences. Experimentally, correlated jet and lepton energy scale\nuncertainties do not make life easier either. All these techniques are sensitive to a lesser\nextent to absolute mass scale than to mass differences, but the common lore that kinematics\nonly constrain mass differences does not hold up to a detailed analysis. Just as a reminder\nwe emphasize that all of these methods only work if we are dealing with one well-defined\nmassive particle responsible for the missing energy in new-physics events.\nWhile all three strategies should in principle work and would then differ mostly by\nstatistics, it is not clear how QCD effects affect them. To illustrate them in action, let\nus now describe how they have been applied to the supersymmetric MSSM parameter\npoint SPS1a [119], which is the only parameter point studied at the necessary level of\nexperimental sophistication [514, 515]. This popular sample point has mg\u0303 ' 600 GeV,\nmq\u0303 ' 550 GeV, mt\u03031 ' 400 GeV, m` \u0303 ' 150 GeV, m\u03c7\u030301 ' 100 GeV, m\u03c7\u030302 ' m\u03c7\u0303\u00b11 ' 200 GeV,\nand m\u03c7\u030303,4 \u223c m\u03c7\u0303\u00b12 ' 400 GeV. These known results will also be the basis of the model\nreconstruction described in Section IV.\nThe classic application of the endpoint method is to the long left-handed squark decay\nchain built out of successive two-body decays [499]. This decay chain can also arise from\nthe first KK excitations of Standard Model states in UED. The relevant decay patterns are:\nq\u0303L \u2192 \u03c7\u030302 q \u2192 ` \u0303\u00b1 `\u2213 q \u2192 \u03c7\u030301 `+ `\u2212 q\n\n(1)\n\n\u00b1\n\nQL \u2192 Z (1) q \u2192 `(1) `\u2213 q \u2192 \u03b3 (1) `+ `\u2212 q\n98\n\n(116)\n\n\f1500\n\nOS-SF SUSY\n\nEvents/1 GeV/100 fb-1\n\nOS-OF SUSY\nSM\n\n1000\n\n500\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n60\nm(ll) (GeV)\n\n80\n\n100\n\nFIG. 29: Invariant mass distribution of two leptons after selection cuts for the SPS1a model: SUSY\nsignal Opposite Sign Same Flavor (OS-SF): full line; SUSY signal Opposite Sign Opposite Flavor\n(OS-OF): dotted line; Standard Model background: grey. Figure from Ref. [79]\n\nWe illustrate these decay chains in the left and right panels of Fig. 28. While the branching\nratio for this decay chain might not be particularly large, it is relatively easy to identify given\nthe pair of leptons and missing energy. For the SPS1a parameter point the long squark decay\nchain of Eq. (116) has a branching ratio around 4%.\nWhen we use kinematic endpoints to extract mass parameters, it is crucial to determine\nthem from a signal-rich sample without a deep sea of background events. Whenever we require leptons and missing energy a major background will be top pairs. The key observation\nis that in long cascade decays the leptons are flavor-locked, which means the combination\ne+ e\u2212 + \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 \u2212 e\u2212 \u03bc+ \u2212 e+ \u03bc\u2212 becomes roughly twice \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 for the signal, while it cancels for\ntop pairs. Using such a combination for the endpoint analysis means the top background is\nsubtracted purely from data, as illustrated in Fig. 29. Note that for rate measurements this\nmethod is not quite as powerful as it looks at first sight \u2013 subtracting backgrounds\nusing\n\u221a\ndata still leaves us with twice the error from the original background events 2 B. For the\nextraction of endpoints, the situation is obviously different.\nThe long squark decay chain for SPS1a-like parameter points has two important advantages. First, for a large enough mass hierarchy we might be able to isolate the one decay\njet just based on its energy [215, 476, 477]. More importantly, the invariant mass of the two\nleptons has a distinctive triangular shape shown in Fig. 29. While this shape does not have\nto survive for other underlying new-physics models [516], the m`` range is always given by\n0<\n\nm2``\n\n<\n\n(m2\u03c7\u03030 \u2212 m2` \u0303)(m2` \u0303 \u2212 m2\u03c7\u03030 )\n2\n\n1\n\nm2` \u0303\n\n0<\n\nm2``\n\n<\n\n(m2Z (1) \u2212 m2`(1) )(m2`(1) \u2212 m2\u03b3 (1) )\nm2`(1)\n\n(117)\n\nIn complete analogy to the di-lepton endpoint, but with somewhat reduced elegance we\ncan measure the threshold and edge of the `+ `\u2212 q distribution and the edges of the two `\u00b1 q\ncombinations [79, 499]. Then, we solve the system for the intermediate without any model\nassumption, which allows us to even measure the dark matter mass to about 10%. The\nlimiting factors will likely be our ability to observe enough endpoints in addition to mmax\n`` ,\nand the jet energy scale uncertainty.

[501].\n\nleptons, where the edge is softened by neutrinos from tau decays [517].\nIf the gluino (or heavy KK gluon) is heavier than the squarks (or KK quarks), its mass\ncan be measured by simply extending the squark chain by one step: g\u0303 \u2192 q q\u0303 [501]. This\nmeasurement becomes more complicated, however, if one of the two jets from the gluino\ndecay is not very hard, because its information will be buried by the combinatorial error\ndue to QCD jet radiation. The way around is to ask for two bottom jets from the strongly\ninteracting decay: g\u0303 \u2192 bb\u0303. In Fig. 30 we see that for example the gluino mass can be\nextracted at the per-cent level, a point at which we might have to start thinking about offshell propagators and at some point even define what exactly we mean by 'masses appearing\nin cascade decays'.\nAlternatively, we can use the same gluino decay to first reconstruct the intermediate\nneutralino or KK Z momentum for lepton pairs near the m`` edge. In that case the invisible\nheavy state is produced approximately at rest, and the momenta are correlated as [79]\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nm\u03c7\u030301\nm\u03b3 (1)\np~\u03c7\u030302 = 1 \u2212\np~`` ,\np~Z (1) = 1 \u2212\np~`` .\n(118)\nm``\nm``\nIf both neutralino masses (or the KK photon and Z masses) are known we can extract\nthe sbottom (KK bottom) and gluino (KK gluon) masses by simply adding the measured\nbottom momenta. Again, for the SPS1a parameter point we can measure the gluino mass\nto few per-cent, depending on the systematic errors. This second method of reconstructing\nan invariant mass of the intermediate state could ideally distinguish different intermediate\nstates, like left or right handed sbottoms.\nFor short decay chains we can use MT 2 to measure the masses of particles decaying to\nthe missing energy state directly. In supersymmetry, this could be a right-handed slepton or\nsquark decaying to a mostly bino LSP. The challenge short decay chains is that extracting\n100\n\n\fthem relies on some kind of veto, which from Section III A we know is problematic for\nlow-pT jets. For the analyses included in Ref. [515] it is assumed that the missing energy\nparticle mass is known from other measurements, so we only the mass of the decaying states\nare extracted from MT 2 . As mentioned above, it might well be possible to measure both\nmasses in one step, using kinks in the MT 2 distribution as a function of the hypothesized\ndark-matter mass [512].\nGiven that endpoint analyses use only a small fraction of the set of signal events, namely\nthose with extreme kinematics, an obvious way to improve the precision of mass measurements is to investigate the entire shape of the invariant mass distributions [500]. One might\nalso hope to use the shape of a kinematic distribution to infer the location of a kinematic\nendpoint that is not directly visible. This can occur when the decay matrix element has\na smooth falloff approaching the endpoint such that the distribution near the endpoint is\nsoftened and disappears into the background noise. Using the shape of the full distribution\ncould allow us to circumvent this challenge, but will typically be much more sensitive to\nbackgrounds than a sharp kinematic endpoint.\nWhile with the appropriate care we can claim that a clearly visible endpoint depends\nonly on the masses of the particles involved, and not on their interaction matrix elements\n(as illustrated for example by Eq.(115) or Eq.(117)) invariant mass distributions are just\nan invariant way of writing angular correlations between the outgoing particles. Those will\ndefinitely depend on the spin assignments of all particles involved, which means that our\nmass measurement will always involve a hypothesis on the nature of the particles inside the\ndecay chain.\nPutting this handicap to work the same technique can be applied to measure the quantum\nnumbers of the the particles involved in a decay cascade. The determination of the spins\nof new particles is particularly important, since many of the inclusive signatures of supersymmetry can also arise from other models where the Standard Model states have new odd\npartners such as UED, and there is a possibility of confusing these very different scenarios.\nIn general, the determination of discrete quantum numbers like the spin of new particles\nis difficult in the absence of fully reconstructed events. The usual threshold behavior is\nnot visible in hadron collider production processes, in particular if the final state includes\nmissing transverse energy. Instead, we have to rely on angular correlations in decays (or\nother clever techniques).\nA well-studied example of spin determination is the squark or KK quark decay chains\ngiven in Eq.(116) [516, 518]. This analysis can be treated in three steps:\n(1) We notice that cascade decays radiate Standard Model particles with known spins. For\nthe squark decay chain of Eq. (116) the particles emitted are all fermions. Hence, the spins\ninside the decay chain alternate between fermions and bosons. This is also true in the\ncorresponding UED process listed in Eq. (116), but in contrast all the spins of the exotic\nstates in the decay chain are reversed.\n(2) Both the thresholds and the edges of all invariant masses of the radiated fermions are\ncompletely determined by the masses inside the decay chains. On the other hand, the shape\nof the distribution between the endpoints is nothing but an angular correlation (in some\nrest frame). This means that the well-established mj` jet-lepton invariant mass distribution\nallows us to analyze spin correlations in squark/KK quark decays in a Lorentz invariant\nway.\n(3) Proton\u2013proton collisions produce considerably more squarks than antisquarks in the\n101\n\n\fFIG. 31: Asymmetry in mj` assuming underlying supersymmetry (dashed) or universal extra\ndimensions (solid).

A decaying\nsquark or KK quark radiates a quark while an antisquark or KK antiquark radiates an\nantiquark, which means that we can define a non-zero production asymmetry between mq`+\nand mq`\u2212\ndN (`+ q) dN (`\u2212 q)\n\u2212\ndm`q\ndm`q\n.\n(119)\nA=\n+\ndN (` q) dN (`\u2212 q)\n+\ndm`q\ndm`q\nThe symbol q refers to either a quark or an antiquarks, since on the jet level they are indistinguishable. This asymmetry is shown in Fig. 31, generated for hierarchical SUSY-like\nand degenerate UED-like spectra. For each spectrum we compare the SUSY and UED hypotheses. We see that provided the radiated Standard Model particles are hard enough we\ncan clearly distinguish the two spin hypotheses. The difference between UED and SUSY\nbecomes more prominent with larger mass splittings between the parent and daughter particles, but is a subtle enough effect so that we need to worry about detector effects and\ncombinatorial backgrounds. Considering other observables in the decay chain may further\nimprove the spin reconstruction in squark decays [519, 520].\nThese basic ideas have also been applied to many other situations, like decays including gauge bosons [521], three-body decays [522], gluino decays with decay-side asymmetries [523], cascades including charginos [524], weak-boson-fusion signatures [525], and\nmore [526, 527]. The spin of the gluino is a particularly important LHC measurement.\nA characteristic signal of the Majorana nature of the gluino are like-sign dileptons in supersymmetric decay cascades originating from QCD production [528]. This can arise either\nfrom squark pair production qq \u2192 q\u0303 q\u0303 via a t-channel gluino exchange, or the symmetric\ndecays\ng\u0303 \u2192 q q\u0303 \u2217 \u2192 q q\u0304 0 `\u2212 \u03bd\u0304 \u03c7\u030301 ,\n\ng\u0303 \u2192 q\u0304 q\u0303 \u2192 q\u0304q 0 `+ \u03bd \u03c7\u030301 .\n\n102\n\n(120)\n\n\fIn both cases, the Majorana nature of the gluino is necessary for these processes to occur.\nOn the other hand a vector KK gluon in UED does not have an associated fermion flow\ndirection, and can also produce same-sign dileptons via\nG(1) \u2192 q Q\u0304(1) \u2192 q q\u0304 0 `\u2212 \u03bd\u0304\u03b3 (1) ,\n\nG(1) \u2192 q\u0304Q(1) \u2192 q\u0304q 0 `+ \u03bd\u03b3 (1) .\n\n(121)\n\nThus, if we can show that the gluino is indeed a fermion, we will also be able to deduce that\nit is a Majorana state, which is an immediate effect of minimal supersymmetry which relates\nthe physical gluino degrees of freedom to the two polarizations of the gluon. If we can now\nshow that the gluino is indeed a fermion we also know it is a Majorana fermion, where this\nMajorana nature is an immediate effect of the supersymmetry which conserves the on-shell\nnumber of degrees of freedom of the gluon and the gluino, as discussed in Section II A 1.\n2.\n\nDirect production of missing energy\n\nDirect production of new particles giving rise to missing energy at the LHC has been\nstudied in considerably less detail than missing energy from cascade decays. The primary\nreason for this is simple. For a particle to produce missing energy it must be quasi-stable,\neither because it is prevented from decaying by a symmetry or due to a combination of\nweak couplings and kinematics. In the first case, the LHC production rates tend to be\nsmall unless there are new QCD-charged states also charged under the symmetry that decay\nto the invisible state, and this brings us back to the cascade decay scenario. The second\npossibility is much less common in models of new physics, and also often implies that the\ndirect production rate for the missing energy particle at the LHC will be very small. In the\npresent subsection we will concentrate on two specific scenarios of direct missing energy:\nmodels of large extra dimensions, and invisible Higgs boson decays. We will also comment\non ways to probe the direct production of invisible stable particles protected by a symmetry,\nsuch as a neutralino LSP in supersymmetry.\nOne situation in which the direct production of missing energy can be significant occurs\nwhen there are very many new particles, each of which couples very weakly to the Standard\nModel and is stable on the time scale of particle colliders. In this case, the small coupling\nand tiny production rate of each individual particle can overcome by the large number\nof individual production channels. This is precisely what occurs in models of large extra\ndimensions (ADD) discussed in Section II B 1. These models contain a tower of very closely\nspaced KK graviton resonances, each of which according to Eq. (59) couples to the Standard\nModel with strength 1/MPl and is long-lived. However, upon summing over the production\nof a large number of KK gravitons, the total inclusive graviton production rate becomes an\nobservable E/TeV effect. Gravitons created this way will leave the detector and generate a\nsignal of direct missing energy.\nPotentially observable effects in ADD models arise collectively, involving the contributions\nof many independent gravitons. This means that there will not be any kind of well-defined\nresonance or similar kinematic feature. Instead, the radiation of graviton towers will add\nmissing energy to Standard Model processes. This will alter the kinematic distributions of\ntransverse momenta or invariant masses much differently than radiating off a Z boson or\nneutrinos. The primary search strategy for such effects is thus to start from well-measured\nstandard candles at the LHC, such as Drell-Yan processes or the production of gauge bosons\nin association with jets, and to look for anomalous deviations.\n103\n\n\f6\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n4\n\n\u03b4=3\n\nEvents / 20 GeV\n\nEvents / 20 GeV\n\n10\n\nMD = 6 TeV\n\u221as = 14 TeV\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\n\u03b4=4\n\n\u221as = 14 TeV\n\njW(e\u03bd), jW(\u03bc\u03bd)\n\njW(e\u03bd), jW(\u03bc\u03bd)\n\njW(\u03c4\u03bd)\n\njW(\u03c4\u03bd)\n\njZ(\u03bd\u03bd)\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\njZ(\u03bd\u03bd)\n\nSignal\n\nSignal\n\n10\n\n1\n\nMD = 5 TeV\n\n10\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\n1400\n\n1600\n\n1800\n\n1\n\n2000\n\nETmiss (GeV)\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\n1400\n\n1600\n\n1800\n\n2000\n\nETmiss (GeV)\n\nFIG. 32: Missing transverse energy from real KK graviton emission in models with large flat extra\ndimensions (ADD). We show the single jet plus gravitons signal and backgrounds after selection\ncuts and for an integrated luminosity of 100 fb\u22121 . Figure from Ref. [241].\n\nPossibly the best way to probe ADD models is to search for a KK graviton recoiling off a\nhard jet by looking at the transverse momentum distribution of the jet. The primary background to this comes from invisible W or Z decays with neutrinos or an undetected lepton.\nThis background can be computed directly, or simply extrapolated from measurements of\nleptonic Z decays. When computing the backgrounds it is essential to include Sudakov logarithms of the form log Ej /mZ arising from a mismatch or massive virtual and real Z bosons.\nUsually, LHC signatures are not sensitive to such effects, because new physics particles tend\nto be heavy, and heavy states are preferably produced non-relativistically. However, the\nsituation for backgrounds can be different. In particular the search for KK gravitons relies\non a very precise understanding of the kinematic distributions at large energy scales, where\nexperimental measurements might be statistically limited. A sample distribution of missing\nenergy produced in association with one or more hard jets is shown in Fig. 32. For the\nleading contributions the missing energy will be balanced by the transverse momentum of\none jet, but including additional jet radiation as well as unseen leptons it is not clear which\nof the two transverse momenta will turn out to be more useful.\nIn Section II B 1 we discuss the impact of a UV completion of extra dimensional gravity\non relevant LHC predictions. In the left panel of Fig.33 we see that the jet + p~Tmiss cross\nsection becomes seriously dependent on physics above\nM? the moment the Planck scale\n\u221a\nenters the range of available energies at the LHC s . 3 TeV. Above this threshold the\ndifference between curves (a) and (b) is small.\nIn the region where the curves differ significantly, UV effects of our modelling of the KK\nspectrum become dominant and any analysis based on the Kaluza\u2013Klein effective theory will\nfail. Luckily, the parton distributions, in particular the gluon density, drop rapidly towards\nlarger parton\n\u221a energies. This effects effectively constrains the impact of the UV region which\nincludes s > M? .\nIn the right panel of Fig.33 we see the 5\u03c3 discovery reach at the LHC with a variable\nultraviolet cutoff \u039bcutoff on the partonic collider energy.

Figure from Ref. [229]. Note that\nMD in both figures corresponds to M? in the text.\n\ncutoff crosses a universal threshold around 4 TeV the discovery contours reach a plateau and\nbecome cutoff independent. This universal feature demonstrates and quantifies the effect\nof the rapidly falling parton densities. The fact that the signal decreases with increasing\ndimension shows that the additional volume element from the n-sphere integration is less\nthan the 1/M? suppression from each additional dimension.\nInstead of looking for real graviton emission we can also search for their virtual effects in\nDrell-Yan production of dilepton pairs, where the s-channel gauge bosons linking incoming\nquarks and outgoing leptons can be replaced by a graviton tower. There will also be a\ngluon fusion contribution to the graviton Drell-Yan process that is not present for (onshell) s-channel gauge bosons. The observable best suited to extract this signal from the\nbackground is the invariant mass of the dileptons m`` , which is expected to show a deviation\nat high energies. As in the case of real graviton emission, the search for new physics in tails\nof distributions is challenging and hinges on our understanding of Standard Model processes\nand their QCD effects.\nVirtual graviton effects are strongly dependent on the detail of the ultraviolet completion\nof the model, as discussed in detail in Section II B 1. Such an ultraviolet completion can\ninclude stringy resonance structures or fixed-point regularized operator kernels. Following\nthe logic for example of the cascade decay measurements discussed in Sections III B 1 and\nIV we can study the m`` behavior in the Drell-Yan process to probe the underlying model\nof higher-dimensional gravity, discussed in detail in Section II B 1.\nAnother way for missing energy to be produced directly at the LHC is through a coupling to the Higgs H. For any new scalar \u03c6 the Higgs Portal coupling is always gauge\ninvariant [529]:\n\u2212 L \u2283 \u03b6 |\u03c6|2 |H|2 .\n(122)\n105\n\n\fFIG. 34: Left: distributions of p~Tmiss distribution for weak-boson-fusion Higgs at the LHC production and its backgrounds. Figure from Ref. [530]. Right: expected LHC reach for an invisible\nHiggs signature. Figure from Ref. [533].\n\nAs long as \u03c6 does not develop of VEV it will not mix with the Higgs. If \u03c6 is light enough,\nthis coupling will also allow the Higgs boson decay mode h \u2192 \u03c6\u2217 \u03c6 which can easily dominate\nthe Higgs branching fraction. When \u03c6 is neutral under the Standard Model and long-lived\nthese Higgs decays will be invisible, and will be a source of direct missing energy.\nMissing energy from the Higgs sector leads us to the question if more complex production\nchannels can be useful if they provide us with more information. Weak boson fusion is known\nto offer such an opportunity in a few key observables without even considering the details of\nthe new particles produced in the central event [498]. The prime example for this strategy\nis the search for an invisibly decaying Higgs boson produced through gluon fusion [530],\nwhose signature consists of missing transverse energy and a pair of hard forward jets. These\nadditional jets from the weak boson fusion process can provide a trigger and a way to\nreduce the Standard Model backgrounds. These forward tagging jets are required to a\nrapidity gap of \u2206\u03b7 & 4.5 and a very large invariant mass, mjj & 1.2 TeV. These cuts\nare stiffer than in the usual Higgs searches, reflecting the fact that aside from a cut on\nmissing energy p~Tmiss & 100 GeV, there is not much else to use to reduce backgrounds.\nThe p~Tmiss distributions for both the Higgs signal and the primary backgrounds are shown\nin Fig. 34. If we know as well that the missing particles have a scalar coupling to the\nlongitudinal components of the weak gauge boson, we can apply an additional cut on the\nazimuthal angle between the two jets, \u2206\u03c6jj < 1, to suppress weak-boson-fusion Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd\nbackgrounds [498, 531].\nA second channel which can be exploited to find an invisible Higgs is inspired by the\ndecay-channel independent Higgs searches at LEP. If we reconstruct a leptonic Z boson\naccompanying a large amount of missing energy, neither triggering nor physics backgrounds\nare huge problems. The main issue for this associated Zh production mode will likely be\ncontrolling the jet activity and fake missing energy from jets missed in the detector [532].\nThe result for invisible Higgs searches are usually quantified in terms of\n\u03be 2 (mH ) =\n\n\u03c3BSM\n(\u03c3 * BR)H\u2192inv\nBR(H \u2192 inv) \u2261\n\u03c3SM\n(\u03c3 * 1)SM\n106\n\n(123)\n\n\f\u03c7+\u03c7+ WBF\nH+H+\n\n2\n\n1/\u03c3 d\u03c3/d\u2206\u03c6(jet , jet )\n\n0.007\nW'+W'+\n0.006\n0.005\n0.004\n0.003\n0.002\n0.001\n00 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000\nPT(jet ), GeV/c\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1/\u03c3 d\u03c3/dPT(jet )\n\n0.009\n0.008\n\n1\n\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n00\n\n\u03c7+\u03c7+ WBF\nH+H+\nW'+W'+\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n2\n\u2206\u03c6(jet , jet )\n1\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n2\n\nFIG. 35: Jet distributions in weak-boson-fusion. The production processes considered are likesign supersymmetric charginos, like-sign Higgs-like scalars, and like-sign heavy gauge bosons with\nmasses around 250 GeV. Figure from Ref. [531].\n\nfor a given Higgs mass. In the right panel of Fig. 34 we see the experimental results for these\ntwo search channels. For a light Higgs boson a 50% branching ratio into an invisible particle\nwill be observable already at low luminosities. It may also be possible to extract the Higgs\nmass from the ratio of the weak-boson-fusion and associated Zh Higgs production rates.\nThe strategy applied for invisible Higgs searches can be generalized to weak-boson-fusion\nproduction of any kind of system. Since the number of possibilities to produce just one\nparticle in W W fusion is limited by the H and Z production rates, we illustrate this for pair\nproduction of new weakly interacting particles Fig. 35. One physics motivation would be look\nfor like-sign particle production: in supersymmetric models this could be like-sign charginos\nwhich are produced through a t-channel neutralino exchange. Seeing such like-sign chargino\npairs would imply that the neutralinos in the t-channel (and possibly the dark matter agent)\nis a Majorana fermion, one of the core predictions of minimal supersymmetry. On the other\nhand, such like-sign dilepton signatures can come as well from the pair production of exotic\nheavy charged gauge bosons W 0+ W 0+ (that arise in UED and little Higgs models), or from a\npair of charged Higgs bosons H + H \u2212 (as in supersymmetry or little Higgs). Note, however,\nthat in many concrete models the rates for these processes will be too small to be seen.\nFrom our experience with the invisible Higgs search we can try to ask: can we make any\nstatements about the nature of particles produced in weak boson fusion, but only based on\nthe kinematics of the tagging jets, i.e. treating any kind of central particle production as\n'invisible'.\nFirst of all, whatever particle(s) we produce in weak boson fusion needs to couple to W\nand/or Z bosons. This coupling can involve the transverse modes from the actual gauge\nsector or the longitudinal Goldstone modes effectively from the Higgs sector. Radiating\ntransverse or longitudinal gauge bosons off quarks leads to different energy and transversemomentum spectra. In weak boson fusion, we can measure this spectrum in the forward\njets recoiling against the gauge bosons; if the new physics produced couples to longitudinal\nW bosons, like charged Higgs bosons will typically do, the transverse momentum spectrum\n\n107\n\n\fof the outgoing jets will be much stronger peaked, as shown in Fig. 35\np2T\n1 + (1 \u2212 x)2\n1 + (1 \u2212 x)2 1\n\u2212\u2192\n2x\n(p2T + (1 \u2212 x) m2W )2\n2x\np2T\n(1 \u2212 x)2\nm2W\n(1 \u2212 x)2 m2W\n\u2212\u2192\nPL (x, pT ) \u223c\nx\n(p2T + (1 \u2212 x) m2W )2\nx\np4T\n\nPT (x, pT ) \u223c\n\n(124)\n\nA second observable which is sensitive to the Lorentz structure of the centrally produced\nnew physics is the azimuthal angle between the forward jets \u2206\u03c6jj ; as we know for example\nfrom weak-boson-production of an invisibly decaying Higgs boson it has a flat distribution\nfor the production of a scalar particle coupling to the two gauge bosons proportional to\ng \u03bc\u03bd . For a pseudo-scalar with a dimension-five coupling to gauge bosons instead, it has\na maximum at \u2206\u03c6 = \u03c0/2, while for a scalar coupling to the transverse tensor at higher\ndimensions it has a minimum at this point [531, 534]. Modulo a slight tilt due to acceptance\ncuts we see precisely this behavior in Fig. 35, where the gauge bosons and fermions with\ntheir non-trivial coupling to gauge bosons can be distinguished from the pair of scalars.\nThe combination of these two jet distributions would therefore allow us to distinguish\nbetween scalar vs fermion/gauge boson production (pT,j ) and between gauge boson vs\nscalar/fermion production (\u2206\u03c6jj ) without even looking at these new states.\nAs a side remark, the angular observable can be linked to the 'golden' Higgs decay to two\nZ bosons: the angle between the two Z decay planes is well known to include information\non the spin of the Higgs resonance [535]. From this decay correlation we get to a production\njet correlation by switching two of the final-state fermions to the initial state and the new\n(Higgs) particle into the final state. The Feynman diagrams are identical to the Higgs decay,\nand the correlation between the decay planes is replaced by an angular correlation between\nthe forward jets.\nThe same analysis becomes even more interesting when we include the case of KK gravitons, i.e. spin-two particles produced in weak boson fusion [534, 536]. In the case of spin-zero\nparticles the production and decay of the heavy states are uncorrelated which means that the\nonly observable is the difference of the azimuthal angles \u2206\u03c6 = \u03c61 \u2212\u03c62 , and for a g \u03bc\u03bd coupling\nits distribution has to be flat. Once we introduce a dimension-five coupling proportional to\nthe two allowed W -W -scalar tensor structures [537]\ng\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\nq1\u03bd q2\u03bc\n\u2212\n(q1 q2 )\n\n\u000f\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 q1\u03c1 q2\u03c3\n\n(125)\n\nthe \u2206\u03c6 distribution develops a shape, but it is still the only combination of \u03c61 and \u03c62 we can\ndefine. The spin-one hypothesis we usually skip because of the Landau-Yang theorem which\nforbids at least an on-shell coupling of a heavy gauge boson. At the spin-two level production\nand decay are not uncorrelated anymore, which means we can probe the (\u03c61 \u2212\u03c62 ) distribution\nof the two jets as well as (\u03c61 + \u03c62 ). Ordered by the polarization of the two incoming\ngauge bosons the actual spin-two production dominates the amplitude and depends only on\n(\u03c61 + \u03c62 ), while all other combinations including (\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 ) from the spin-zero production\nat subleading [534]. In contrast to the argument above this implies that to study gravitons\nin weak boson fusion we cannot rely on jet-jet correlations anymore but have to include the\ndecay products in our analysis.\n108\n\n\fFIG. 36: Luminosity required for a 5\u03c3 LHC discovery of E6 -inspired Z 0 models (top to bottom: \u03c8,\n\u03c7, \u03b7, LRM model) as a function of MZ 0 . From Ref. [539].\nC.\n\nResonances\n\nA standard method to find new physics at particle colliders is to look for new resonances\nin the production rates of Standard Model particle. Such resonances arise in a number of\nmodels extending the Standard Model and can produce a wide but related range of signals\nat the LHC. We discuss here some of the potential new resonance signals that might be seen\nat the LHC.\n1.\n\nMassive neutral vector bosons\n\nAdditional U (1) gauge forces are a simple extension of the Standard Model that occur\nin many theories of physics beyond the Standard Model. Sometimes a general resonance\n(particularly one decaying to leptons) is referred to as a Z 0 ; we reserve this designation for\na massive neutral vector particle, with couplings both to quarks and to leptons.\nThe most common examples of Z 0 s arise in extensions of the gauge sector of the Standard\nModel, such as SU (3)c \u00d7 SU (2)W \u00d7 U (1)Y \u00d7 U (1)0 . More complicated constructions can have\none or more of the Standard Model gauge factors enlarged to a bigger group containing an\nextra neutral generator. This includes the case where the entire Standard Model gauge\nstructure is unified into a higher rank GUT group such as SO(10). In any of these options,\nextra massive gauge fields arise from breaking these larger symmetries down to the Standard\nModel itself.\nIn this section we will take the U (1)0 extension of the Standard Model as a prototype\nZ 0 model, with a well defined structure and parameters. Larger gauge group cases fit comfortably within the U (1)0 framework, but with additional relations among parameters and\nmore new particles to search for. Because of its universality and the connection to larger\nand potentially unified gauge groups, a Z 0 is one of the most extensively studied extensions\nof the Standard Model in the literature [260, 538\u2013541]. If it is not excessively massive and\nhas a large coupling to quarks and leptons, a Z 0 should lead to a relatively early discovery\nat the LHC [551].\nThe classic search strategy for a Z 0 is a resonance in the e+ e\u2212 or \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 invariant mass\nspectra above the Drell-Yan background. The production rate for such a resonance therefore\n109\n\n\fFIG. 37: Z 0 coupling measurements at the LHC with 100 fb\u22121 , for four different E6 -inspired Z 0\nmodels with mass 1.5 TeV. Dashed lines are statistical errors and dotted lines are PDF uncertainties. The solid lines are combined errors. From Ref. [540].\n\ndepends on the coupling of the Z 0 to both quarks and leptons. If we assume that the Z 0 has\nfamily-independent couplings, motivated in order to evade strong bounds from FCNCs, and\nno exotic states into which it can decay, the physics at the LHC may be expressed in terms of\nits mass MZ 0 , its width \u0393Z 0 , and its couplings to quark doublets, up-type singlets, down-type\nsinglets, lepton doublets, and charged lepton singlets zQ , zu , zd , zL , ze . LHC search prospects\nfor a set of benchmark E6 Z 0 models are shown in Fig. 36.\nIf a Z 0 signal is discovered at the LHC, further measurements can help us to determine\nits fundamental properties. A Z 0 dilepton resonance mass peak can be reconstructed with\nhigh precision. The width of the peak may be also observable if it is larger than the lepton\nenergy resolution, expected to be sub-percent at large invariant masses. If the Z 0 does have\na substantial width, the mass estimate tends to be on the low side, because the PDFs distort\nthe resonance in favor of low invariant masses.\nThe Z 0 production cross section provides further information, although subject to the\nuncertainties discussed in Section III A. Under our assumption that the Z 0 couples universally\nto all fermions of a given charge and chirality, the cross-section is a PDF-weighted sum of\ntwo terms [260],\ncu,d \u2261\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001 2\nMZ 0\n2\n2\n2\n2\n+ zu,d\nBR Z 0 \u2192 `+ `\u2212 .\nzQ\n+ zu,d\nzL + ze2 = zQ\n24\u03c0\u0393Z 0\n\n(126)\n\nA cross section measurement then constrains one linear combination of cu and cd .\nWith larger and experimentally understood data samples, one can also consider the ratio of Z 0 production at large rapidities relative to central production. At large rapidities,\nthe dependence on cu is enhanced due to the greater valence content of up-quarks in the\nproton, allowing us to determine cu and cd independently [540]. A further parity-violating\ncombination [540],\n\u0001 2\n\u0001\nMZ 0\n2\n2\neu,d \u2261\nzu,d\n\u2212 zQ\nze \u2212 zL2 ,\n(127)\n24\u03c0\u0393Z 0\nreflects itself in the forward-backward asymmetry of the produced leptons. Measurements of\nthe forward-backward asymmetry at the LHC are complicated by the fact that in principle\none cannot tell the direction of initial state quark. However, we can use the fact that the\n110\n\n\fvalence quarks have more support at higher partonic energy fractions than the sea antiquarks to reconstruct the quark direction on a statistical basis [552]. Figure 37 shows\npossible outcomes for the E6 -inspired Z 0 models with mass 1.5 TeV, assuming 100 fb\u22121\nof integrated luminosity. Further improvements are possible by combining LHC resonance\ndata with high luminosity low energy scattering measurements, and off-shell Z 0 effects at\nthe LHC [540, 541].\n2.\n\nSU (2) Gauge Extensions\n\nLarger gauge extensions of the SM than U (1) are possible, for example SU (2). When\nthe extended gauge symmetry does not commute with the SU (2)L of the SM, some of the\nresulting additional gauge bosons carry electroweak charge, leading to heavy electrically\ncharged states such as e.g. W 0 . The detailed phenomenology of the W 0 s depends rather\nsensitively as to how the SM fermions are charged under the additional SU (2).\nThe most prevalent SU (2) extension is SU (2)R [542]. In this construction, the righthanded quarks and leptons are combined to form SU (2)R doublets. Such a gauge group is\na fairly common stage from a single grand unified symmetry to the Standard Model. In a\nsupersymmetric context, they are popular for automatically enforcing R-parity conservation\nand as constructions which lead naturally to a see-saw theory of neutrino masses [543]. Leftright symmetric models have an extremely rich phenomenology (particularly supersymmetric\nconstructions). The most immediate ingredients of interest at hadron colliders are the W 0\nbosons, which have large (electroweak size) couplings to SM quarks and leptons, and thus\nare readily produced as a resonance with large branching ratio into leptons, `\u03bd` or single\ntop quarks, tb. Tevatron direct searches and precision electroweak bounds require masses\ngreater than about 800 GeV \u2013 1 TeV [544] and LHC searches are expected to probe masses\nup to roughly 5 TeV at the LHC [545].\nMore general SU (2) extensions may act differently on the various SM fermions. The\nun-unified model [546] replaces the SU (2) of the SM with SU (2)1 \u00d7 SU (2)2 , where SU (2)1\ncouples to leptons, and SU (2)2 to quarks. In the mass basis, this results in the usual three\nlight gauge bosons as well as an approximately degenerate set of W 0\u00b1 and Z 0 which couple\neither preferentially to quarks or to leptons, depending on the parameter choices. Such a\nW 0 thus has both of the commonly searched-for decay modes (`\u03bd and tb) of the left-right\nmodels, but with the branching ratio between them controlled by a free parameter. Its\ncouplings will also be left- rather than right-chiral, which will reflect itself, for example, in\nthe polarization of top quarks from the decay mode into tb.\nA final class of SU (2) extensions differentiate the various SM generations. Top-flavor [547]\nalso replaces SU (2)SM with SU (2)1 \u00d7 SU (2)2 , where now SU (2)1 couples to the 3rd family,\nand SU (2)2 to the first and second generations. The result is a set of W 0 and Z 0 with\nenhanced coupling to the third generation fermions, resulting in larger branching ratios\nfor W 0 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4 and W 0 \u2192 tb. Such models contain non-perturbative effects which lead\nto novel (but difficult to see experimentally against background) baryon-number violating\ninteractions at the LHC [548] which may further explain the baryon asymmetry of the\nUniverse [549].\n\n111\n\n\fHiggsless(Unitary gauge)+BG\n\n10\n\n0\n\n)\n\n5\n\nW Z Z\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n(fb\n\nSM pp->jjZ Z (jj4l) Total\n0\n\n3\n\n100\n\nW\n\n0\n\nSM pp->qgZ Z (jj4l)\n0\n\nluminosity\n\n0\n\nSM pp->ggZ Z (jj4l)\n0\n\n0\n\nSM pp->W Z Z (jj4l)\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nSM pp->Z Z Z (jj4l)\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n5\n\n10\n\nW Z jj\n0\n\n3\n\n0\n\nW Z jj\n0\n\n0\n\nIntegrated\n\nE.N. / 20 GeV @ 100 fb\n\n-1\n\nHiggsless(Feynman gauge)+BG\n\n0.1\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\nM(Z\n\n0\n\njj)\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\n1\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\nM\n\nGeV\n\nW1\n\n800\n\n900\n\n1000\n\n(GeV)\n\nFIG. 38: Left: the invariant mass of jj`+ `\u2212 , showing how a peak from \u03c1\u00b1\nT is visible above Standard\n\u00b1\n\u2217\nModel backgrounds in the Drell-Yan-like process pp \u2192 W \u2192 \u03c1T Z.

The most general signatures arise from a weak isotriplet of\nvector particles called techni-rhos, whose presence is required to at least partially unitarize\nW W scattering. Most collider studies of the \u03c1T s [298] are in the context of the 'technicolor\nstraw man model' implemented in Pythia [478]. They may have reasonably large couplings\nto Standard Model fermions, in which case they can be caught by standard Z 0 or W 0 searches.\nThe dominant decays are expected to be into a techni-pion \u03c0T , which itself is expected to\ndecay largely into heavy fermion pairs plus an electroweak boson, W , Z, or \u03b3 [299].

They decay into pairs of jets, leptons, and Higgs and\nweak bosons including photons. The relative branching ratios depend on where the Standard\nModel zero-mode wave functions have support in the extra dimension. When the Standard\nModel is confined to the IR brane, the couplings are democratic. On the other hand, when\nthe Standard Model fields propagate in the bulk, the KK gravitons couple most strongly to\nfields localized toward the IR brane. In this case, there also arise spin-1 KK excitations of\nthe Standard Model gauge bosons which we will discuss in Section III D.\nWhen the branching ratios into leptons are substantial enough, RS KK gravitons may be\nvisible through a standard Z 0 dilepton search. If the KK scale is low enough, more than one\nKK level may be visible. LHC cross sections and branching ratios into leptons for the first\ntwo KK modes are shown in the left panel of Fig. 39, where it is assumed that the Standard\nModel fields are confined to the IR brane and that the curvature is given by k/M\u0304Pl = 0.1.\nSpin-2 resonances lead to a distinctive angular distribution of their fermionic decay products [355\u2013357, 363, 534]. The right panel of Fig. 39 illustrates the distributions for a spin-2\nresonance, a scalar resonance, and three different vector resonances with left-chiral, rightchiral, and vector-like coupling to the fermions, and shows simulated data corresponding to\na 1000 events of a massive spin-2 particle's decay into leptons.\nIn models with universal extra dimensions (UED), the higher KK modes of Standard\nModel particles are even under KK parity, and couple to zero-mode fields through boundary\noperators. As a result, they can be singly produced at the LHC through processes such\nas q q\u0304 \u2192 G(2) , \u03b3 (2) , Z (2) , where the index (2) can be replaced by any KK-even state index\nwhose mass is accessible at the LHC. For the chiral square, the lightest of these are the (1, 1)\nmodes.\nWhile the G(2) decays into jets, and is challenged by the large dijet backgrounds, the\n\u03b3 (2) and Z (2) states have significant branching ratios into leptons, and would be detected\nby a standard Z 0 search. In some cases, decays into pairs of the lightest level of KK-odd\n113\n\n\fFIG. 40: Left: cross sections for single production of level-2 KK modes of the gauge bosons in the\nminimal UED 5D model as a function of the size of the extra dimension.

[288].\n\nmodes will also be open, and if so, tend to dominate because the (2)-(1)-(1) coupling is\nthrough bulk physics as opposed to boundary terms. In Fig. 40 we show the cross sections\nfor single production of the level-2 KK modes of the gauge bosons in the 5D UED theory,\nassuming minimal boundary terms [288]. That study concluded that both resonances can\nbe discovered with 300 fb\u22121 up to masses of about 2 TeV, or R\u22121 of about 1 TeV.\n\n5.\n\nR-parity violation and leptoquarks\n\nLeptoquarks are fundamental particles which carry baryon and lepton numbers [553, 554].\nThey come as scalars or vector particles, reflecting the Lorentz structure of their coupling\nto one quark and one lepton. Their baryon and lepton numbers can either be aligned, such\nthey decay to q`+ or anti-aligned, which means they decay to q`\u2212 .\nMost importantly, the couplings to quarks and leptons do not have to be family-universal.\nThis classification can best be seen in a supersymmetric realization of scalar leptoquarks as\nR-parity violating squarks. Their lepton couplings arise from the superpotential terms\n\u2212 W \u2283 \u03bb0ijk Li *Qj Dkc ,\n\n(129)\n\nwhere (i, j, k) are generation indices [555]. For scalar leptoquarks decaying to q`+ , the\ncoupling matrix \u03bb0 includes all possible cases. Including a further R-parity and baryon\nnumber violating superpotential coupling of the form \u03bb00 U c Dc Dc would generate rapid proton\ndecay through the combination \u03bb0 * \u03bb00 , which is why in the MSSM we require R parity\nconservation.\nHowever, the bounds exclusively on \u03bb0 are considerably weaker, which means that such\nan operator does not have to be forbidden by an exact symmetry. The main constraints\ncome from generic limits on four-fermion operators, for example from flavor-changing neutral\n114\n\n\fFIG. 41: Reconstruction of the hyperpion and coloron masses in the four-jet and eight-jet channels.\nThe masses in the left panel are 225 GeV for the hyperpion and 750 GeV for the coloron. Figures\nfrom Ref. [561].\n\ncurrents. Including the mass scale M of the leptoquark these limits scale like (\u03bb0 * \u03bb0 )/M ,\nwhere the combination of coupling matrices is really a matrix multiplication. Limits from\nrare decays as well as from HERA scale like (\u03bb0*\u03bb0 )/M 2 [556], as do limits from atomic parity\nviolation [557, 558]. For the pair production of leptoquarks at hadron colliders only their\nmass is relevant - the coupling to leptons comes in when we consider decay channels which\nshould easily be detected at the LHC [559].\nWhile HERA with its ep initial state was designed to search for leptoquarks in the s\nchannel, its reach is roughly matched by the Tevatron, where both proton beams have similar\nenergies. Modern multi-purpose hadron colliders are indeed perfectly suited to search for\nnew states as long as they carry color charge. As far as leptoquark signatures are concerned,\ntwo leptons plus two hard jets, reconstructing two identical leptoquark mass peaks are a\nperfect hadron collider signature, both from a triggering and a reconstruction point of view.\nOnly Z 0 searches require less of an understanding of QCD at the LHC.\n6.\n\nMulti-jet resonances\n\nOne of the most important questions concerning resonances at the LHC is if and how well\nwe can determine the masses of heavy states decaying exclusively to jets. In supersymmetry\nor other models with dark matter candidates, large missing energy with its usual advantages\nand disadvantages will usually accompany such multi-jet events. Instead, we now introduce\na set of fermions which are charged under SU (3)c as well as a 'hypercolor' gauge group\nwith a confinement scale \u039bHC [560]. At low energies we would see a SU (3)c adjoint scalar\nhyperpion as well as a SU (3)c adjoint vector-like coloron. Just like in QCD the hyperpion\n\n115\n\n\fis expected to be the lighter of the two states.

It\nalso includes a decay coupling of the heavier coloron to two hyperpions and the hyperpion\ncoupling to gluons. The Signatures relevant at the LHC in this toy model are [561]\npp \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 \u2192 4 jets\n\npp \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1 \u2192 4 \u03c0 \u2192 8 jets .\n\n(131)\n\nIn Fig. 41 we see that extracting the hyperpions with their fairly low mass poses no problem\nto the LHC. The analysis is based on the four hardest jets and a pairing criterion which forces\ntwo combinations of two jets each to reconstruct the same invariant mass within 50 GeV.\nThe problem becomes harder once we try to extract the coloron as well. Extending the\nleft panel of Fig. 41 to include also the four-jet invariant mass we can check that there is no\npeak at the coloron mass, because most hyperpions are generated as a continuum in gluon\nfusion. Instead, we have to search for coloron pair production in the eight-jet channel, with\neight staggered pT,j cuts between 320 and 40 GeV. From Section III A we know that we\nshould expect this softest jet to already be affected by QCD jet combinatorics. The coloron\nsignal we again extract through pairing criteria, assuming we know the hyperpion's mass.\nIn the right panel of Fig. 41 we see that the peak of the inclusive HT with optimized pT,j\ncuts indeed traces the coloron masses.\nD.\n\nTop signatures\n\nThe top quark in the Standard Model plays a special role in several ways. From an\nexperimental point of view it is the only quark which decays before it can hadronize [562]. Its\ndecays produce both leptonic and hadronic structures, which can be separately reconstructed\nas jets, leptons, and missing energy. These are precisely the structures used to find the Higgs\nboson or new physics at the LHC. This means that the top quark is a laboratory for many\nexperimental or simulational aspects which must be controlled in searches for new physics\nAs discussed in Section I B, from a theory point of view the top quark, as the Standard Model particle with the strongest Higgs coupling, gives the largest contribution to the\nquadratic divergence in the Higgs mass parameter. As a result, naturalness suggests that\nthere exists a top partner sector whose masses must be close to 1 TeV. Thus, taking naturalness seriously, light top partners are one of the most robust predictions of solutions for\nthe hierarchy problem. The determination of their properties is one of the primary means\nby which the different proposed solutions can be discriminated.\n1.\n\nTop Quarks from Cascade Decays\n\nAt the LHC we can study effective theories containing both fermionic (as expected in\nlittle Higgs theories) and scalar (as expected in supersymmetric theories) top partners t0\n116\n\n\f900\n\n800\n\n800\n\n700\n\n700\n600\n600\nmn\n\nmn\n\n500\n500\n\n400\n400\n300\n300\n200\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n300\n\n1000\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900\n\n1000\n\nmt'\n\nmt'\n\nFIG. 42: Discovery prospects in the Mt0 -MN plane for pair production of fermion (left) and scalar\n(right) top partners t0 decaying into tETmiss .

[563].\n\nwhich, motivated by dark matter, decay into an on-shell top quark and a dark matter\nparticle N . The top partner spin is then either s = 0 or s = 1/2 so that the decay t0 \u2192 tN\nis allowed [563, 564]. The discovery mode for such decays rely on hadronic top decays,\nleading to a final state containing two b-initiated jets, four light-quark jets, two pairs of\nwhich come from a W decays, and missing energy from the pair of dark matter particles.\nTo suppress QCD and W +jets backgrounds a standard requirement of ETmiss > 100 GeV\nand HT > 500 GeV is usually applied. In addition, two b-tags and loose cuts to reconstruct\npairs of light quarks into W s help to further reduce backgrounds. The reconstructed W\nbosons and b-tagged jets can then be reconstructed into top quarks. A plethora of relevant\nStandard Model backgrounds have to be considered in addition to the generic signal [563].\nSimulations of these signals and the relevant backgrounds suggest that with 10 fb\u22121 , the\nLHC can discover a fermion top partner up to about 850 GeV or a scalar top partner up\nto about 600 GeV, provided Mt0 \u2212 MN > 200 GeV. Detailed contours in the Mt0 -MN plane\nare shown in Fig. 42. In the region where a discovery is possible, kinematic variables such\nas meff allow us to measure the mass difference Mt0 \u2212 MN , but provide limited information\nabout the absolute scale of the masses themselves. If one is willing to assume that the pair\nproduction of the colored t0 pair is through ordinary SU (3)c interactions, for a fixed t0 spin\nthe leading-order cross section is only a function of Mt0 and \u03b1s (Mt0 ). This is similar to stop\npair production in supersymmetry which does not allow for a t-channel gluino exchange\nbecause there is no top flavor content inside the proton at the LHC [87].\nThis way we can use the production rate times branching ratio to determine Mt0 . Section III A lists many reasons for why this is a very hard measurement, but it may be the only\nhandle available lacking better observables. Generic leading-order errors on the cross section\nalone ranging around 50 \u2212 100%, plus errors due to detector efficiencies and coverage imply\nthat we would only rely on such (\u03c3 * BR)-type information in the absence of other useful\nmeasurements [150, 565, 566]. Next-to-leading order predictions for new physics processes\n\n117\n\n\fare then mandatory, to reduce the theory uncertainty to the 20% level [87]. The same can\nbe true for the branching ratios [567].\nIn contrast, we remember that QCD corrections to kinematics are known to be under\ncontrol: additional jet radiation is well described by modern matching schemes and will not\nlead to unexpected QCD effects. Off-shell effects in cascade decays can of course be large\nonce particles become almost mass degenerate [568], but in the standard SPS1a cascades\nthese effects are expected to be small. This confirms that the key to distinguishing between\nsolutions to the hierarchy problem is to directly construct the spin of the t0 , for example by\nmaking use of the techniques discussed in Section III B.\nLonger decay chains are possible. For example, in supersymmetric theories with a sufficiently heavy gluino, the decay g\u0303 \u2192 tt\u0303\u2217 may be important. In particular, the stop may\nbe among the lightest of the squarks because of the larger mixing induced by the top mass.\nIf light enough, the stop may dominantly decay into c\u03c7\u03030 . Since each gluino decays 50% of\nthe time into tt\u0303\u2217 or t\u0304t\u0303, half of the gluino pairs produce tt or t\u0304t\u0304, like-sign top quarks whose\nleptonic decays produce like-sign leptons [569, 570]. This analysis is completely analogous to\nthe usual like-sign dileptons from gluino decays, Eq. (120), with the additional complication\nof a large final state multiplicity leading to combinatorial effects. A possible way out would\nbe to employ the top-tagging we will discuss below. Searches based on like-sign leptons,\nb-tagged jets, and missing energy are expected to yield a 5\u03c3 discovery of the gluino pair\nproduction above the Standard Model and other SUSY backgrounds for gluino masses up\nto about 900 GeV provided mg\u0303 > Mq\u0303 [569]. There are also good prospects to reconstruct\nthe spectrum by studying kinematic endpoints [569, 570].\nHigher mass stops may decay via t\u0303 \u2192 \u03c7+ b, t\u0303 \u2192 \u03c702 t, or t\u0303 \u2192 t\u03c7\u03030 [571\u2013574]. Top decays to\na tagged bottom jet and a chargino are one of the standard search channels at the Tevatron,\neven though the fact that they are not separable from top pair production makes them\nhard to extract from the tt\u0304 background. At the LHC, angular correlations and a different\nETmiss spectrum are unlikely to be sufficient to extract stop pair production out of the hugely\nincreased top pair background. Nevertheless, for benchmark points where the gluino mass\nvaries between roughly 500 GeV and 900 GeV an early LHC discovery is limited only by our\nunderstanding of the detector, and information about masses can be reconstructed using\nkinematic quantities such as meff and mtb .\nTop signatures also arise in cascade decays from the 6D UED chiral square model [280]\nwith minimal boundary terms. As explained in Sec. II B 2, the spectrum contains (1, 1)\nKK modes with boundary term coupling to Standard Model quarks, and so the LHC can\n(1,1)\nproduce the vector states resonantly through q q\u0304 \u2192 V\u03bc\nwith the largest cross section\n(1,1)\nfor the KK gluon, g\u03bc , see Fig. 43. Once produced, the dominant decay is through the\nKK-number preserving bulk coupling into a (1, 1) fermion and its zero mode counterpart.\nThe (1, 1) fermions decay mainly into a zero-mode fermion and one of the (1, 1) scalar\nadjoint particles, KK modes of the physical 5 and 6 components of the KK gauge fields.\nWith minimal boundary terms, the scalar adjoints are the lightest states in a given gauge\nrepresentation at that KK level, and the (1, 1) states tend to decay into a pair of zero-mode\nfermions. However, the boundary operator by which they couple is such that for on-shell\nfermion the coupling is proportional to mf , meaning in practice they always decay into a\npair of top quarks. The net result is thus a pair of light jets and a pair of top quarks, with\n\n118\n\n\f105\n104\n\nsigma\n\n103\n102\n101\n100\n10-1\n0.50\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n4.5\n\nMR\n\n(1,1)\n\nFIG. 43: Cross sections for production of (1, 1) modes of (top to bottom) g\u03bc\nat the LHC.

For example, a model of a chiral fourth generation can have the decays b0 \u2192 tW \u2212 [204, 575].\nVector-like quarks also have charged current decays into top quarks, as well as FCNC decays t0 \u2192 tZ and t0 \u2192 th [323, 576, 577], including KK modes of top and its partners [385].\n2.\n\nA Composite Top Quark\n\nIn the dual interpretation of RS warped extra dimensions, the top is largely composite.\nRS is a compelling vision of compositeness, which manages to solve the hierarchy problem,\nand the related phenomenology is discussed separately in Sections II E and III C. However,\nother constructions are possible in which the top is a among the lightest bound states of\nsome new confined force. Such theories may be explored model-independently using effective\nfield theory [578\u2013582]. Following Ref. [578], we consider the case where the right-handed\ntop is composite. A composite tR is less bounded by precision electroweak data, and allows\nfor a lower compositeness scale.\nIf the top is composite at scale \u039b, the leading deviation at energies below that scale is\nin the form of higher dimensional operators characterized by that scale. Naive dimensional\nanalysis would suggest that the most important operator is the dimension six coupling of\nfour top quarks [578],\n\u0003\u0002 k\n\u0003\ng2 \u0002 i \u03bc\nt\u0304\n\u03b3\nP\nt\nt\u0304\n\u03b3\nP\nt\n(132)\nR\nj\n\u03bc\nR\nl\n\u039b2\nwhere the color indices i, j, k, and l may be contracted either into pairs of singlets or octets\nand the dimensionless coupling g is expected to be \u223c 4\u03c0 by naive dimensional analysis.\nExisting bounds from the Tevatron are rather weak.

The SM four top rate is indicated by the black line. From Ref. [580].\n\nbasically impossible to probe. One can look for subleading operators, which may influence\nthe production of tt\u0304 or single top production by modifying the top coupling to the gluons and\nweak bosons [583\u2013585]. Since these deviations are the effects of higher dimension operators,\nthey lead to differences in kinematics, and are more pronounced for more energetic tops.\nNonetheless, such constraints are relatively mild, allowing compositeness scales as low as a\nfew hundred GeV [582]. Such a low scale opens the door to the possibility for huge effects\nat the LHC.\nIn fact, it may be that the scale of compositeness is so low that the LHC need not be\ncontent with subtle deviations in top couplings, but can directly access higher resonances.\nOne can imagine an analogue of the \u03c1 meson of the new force, one of the higher excited\nresonances of the top itself. Since some of the top's constituents must be colored, one can\neasily imagine color octet or singlet vector particles, with large coupling to the top but\nperhaps negligibly weak coupling to light fermions. In Fig. 44 we show the production\nrates for the processes pp \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1 (color octet \u03c1) and pp \u2192 tt\u0304\u03c1 (color singlet or octet \u03c1) as\ncomputed in Ref. [580]. Since the \u03c1 has essentially 100% branching fraction into tt\u0304, both of\nthese processes lead to a four top quark final state.\nThe Standard Model rate for four top production is of order a few fb, whereas the \u03c1\nsignals may increase it by more than a factor of 103 if the \u03c1 is sufficiently light. Four top\nsignals may be extracted from backgrounds making use of the decay mode leading to likesign charged leptons, the dominant backgrounds to which are weak boson production and\ntt\u0304. Studies [580, 581] indicate that with 100 fb\u22121 , the LHC can extract such signals with 5\u03c3\nsignificance provided they are of order 10s of fb, corresponding to \u03c1 masses of a few TeV.\n3.\n\nMassive top resonances\n\nAs discussed in Sections II B 2,II D , II C, and II E 1 the LHC might face the situation\nwhere a very heavy resonance - some kind of 'heavy gluon' - is produced and then decays\ninto two Standard Model particles.

In\nthe left panel we show the signal relative to the irreducible Standard Model tt\u0304 background, while\nin the right panel we show the signal relative to the rate for hard central di-jets with pT > 500 GeV\nand |\u03b7| < 0.5. Both figures come from Ref. [383].\n\nto a pair of leptons or a pair of jets, simply using a side-bin analysis. A problem arises\nif these new very heavy states decay preferably to a pair of top quarks [586, 587]. The\ntop quarks produced will be highly boosted, implying that their decays products will be\nhighly collimated. As a result, the standard top quark identification techniques that rely on\nidentifying well-separated decay objects may no longer work.\nResolving collimated top decay products is limited by the granularity of the ATLAS and\nCMS calorimeters, typically of the order of R \u223c 0.1. As long as the top decay products can\nbe resolved on this scale, we can attempt to reconstruct semi-leptonic top pairs in analogy to\nthe current Tevatron analyses [588]. For very boosted tops, the jet algorithms will combine\nall decay products into a single jet, possibly faking a more common light jet.\nThe prospects for discovering a very heavy gluon decaying to tops at the LHC depend on\nhow well we can distinguish collimated top jets from QCD jets. If no separation is possible\nrelative to QCD dijets, the signal will almost certainly be swamped by the Standard Model\nbackground. We illustrate this feature in Fig. 45, where we show the predicted tt\u0304 KKgluon signal along with projected Standard Model backgrounds. In the left panel we show\nonly the Standard Model tt\u0304 background. Evidently, the signal is visible above this optimistic\nbackground estimate. In the right panel we show the potential background from hard central\ndijets with pT > 500 GeV and |\u03b7| < 0.5. If this background is not distinguishable at all from\nthe tt\u0304 events from a KK gluon, the signal will be extremely difficult to find.\nRecent investigations of the decays of boosted objects have found that, both in the\nStandard Model [589, 590] as well as in searches for heavy resonances [591\u2013596], they can be\ntreated in analogy with the usual tau and bottom reconstruction methods.

Filtering is applied\nto reduce the contamination by the underlying event. Figure from Ref. [590].\n\nde-clustering of the fat jet we will find one splitting where the jet mass drops from mheavy to\nmuch smaller values. If we manage to analyze such fat jets and distinguish them from QCD\nbackgrounds we can identify W bosons [591], top quarks [594, 595], Higgs bosons [589, 590],\nas well as supersymmetric particles [592, 593] in their purely hadronic decay modes and\nwithout significant combinatorial backgrounds.\nIn particular, top tagging [590, 594] should be a reliable method at the LHC because\nwe can apply three different criteria to the fat jet and its subjets, and hence minimize its\nmis-tagging probability. First, we know all particle masses involved, which means that we\ndo not have to avoid an implicit mass criterion which sculpts the background and destroys\na possible side bin analysis in the jet mass. Typical mass windows for the reconstructed\nmasses are 20%. In addition, we can exploit the left-handed coupling for the W boson to\nfermions. In the rest frame of the reconstructed W we can measure the angle \u03b8h between\nthe top direction and the softer of the two W decay jets. In Fig. 46 we see that for top\njets this distribution is essentially flat, while for QCD jets it diverges as a soft singularity\nproportional to 1/(1 \u2212 cos \u03b8h ). With all three criteria the top tagging efficiency, depending\non the pT of the top jet, reaches up to 50% with a mis-tagging probability of 1 \u2212 5%. An\nalternative to the search for massive splittings using a Cambridge-Aachen jet algorithm [597]\nis to look for jet functions inside the fat jet [596]. A detailed comparison of these different\napproaches might only be possible once we have LHC data.\nOne final aspect we need to study before we can claim that top tagging works at the LHC\nis the underlying event [497]: the larger the size of the initial jet becomes the more dangerous\n4\nadditional QCD activity from the underlying event, proportional to Rjj\n, becomes. At some\nstage of the analysis we have to remove soft QCD activity from the constituents of the fat\njet [598], for example to ensure that for example the W and top mass windows in the top\ntagger cover the correct distributions. The most effective method is filtering the constituents\nat a finer resolution than the size of the fat jet [589]. For example, a fat Higgs jet in W H\nproduction has a maximum size of Rbb = 1.2; in the filtering procedure we increase the\nresolution to Rfilt = min(0.3, Rbb /2) and identify the three hardest subjets which appear at\nthis finer scale. Only these three subjets enter the calculation of the jet mass, i.e. the mass\n122\n\n\fof the heavy decaying object. The same technique we can apply to fat top jets which involve\nto mass drops inside the fat jet, one from the top mass to the W mass and another one from\nthe W mass to massless quark jets. For the W candidate we take the three hardest subjets\nwithin Rfilt = min(0.3, R12 /2), based on the separation of the two hardest subjet. For the\ntop candidate we add two more subjets with a resolution Rfilt = min(0.3, RW ). For the most\nchallenging case of an initial top jet size of R = 1.5 for tt\u0304H production in the Standard\nModel we show the reconstructed W and top mass distributions including underlying event\nin Fig. 46.\nE.\n\nMetastable charged states\n\nMany of the models of new physics discussed in Section II contain heavy exotic particles\ncharged under electromagnetism or QCD that are quasi-stable on collider time scales. In\ncontrast to heavy particles that decay promptly to the Standard Model, such metastable\ncharged states interact directly with the components of the LHC detectors. A qualitatively\ndifferent set of collider search strategies are therefore needed to detect and identify them.\nLong-lived particles carrying an electric charge can arise in a number of ways. In supersymmetry with gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking it is possible to have a slepton\nor chargino NLSP that decays very slowly to a stable gravitino LSP [599]. These possible\nNLSP candidates would be produced at the LHC primarily at the end of cascade decay\nchains originating with a pair of strongly-interacting superpartners. Thus, their net production rate is dominated by QCD, and a pair of charged massive particles will arise in every\nsupersymmetric event. Another example in this is a heavy lepton that only decays to the\nStandard Mode through higher-dimensional operators. Their production proceeds primarily\nthrough electroweak processes. For both of these examples and also more generally, the\ndirect collider effects of long-lived charged states depend primarily on their masses, electric\ncharges, and the energies at which they are created.\nOnce produced, a heavy electromagnetically charged particle will propagate through the\ndetector. Along the way, it will leave charged tracks in the tracking chambers, lose energy\nto ionizing interactions with the detector components, and finally pass through the muon\nchamber, which is sufficient to trigger on [78, 80, 113, 128\u2013130, 600]. These features are\nsimilar to those exhibited by a muon in the LHC detectors. In contrast to hard muons,\nwhich are ultra-relativistic at the LHC, charged particles with masses on the order of 100-\n1000 GeV are expected to be produced semi-relativistically with \u03b2\u03b3 \u223c 1. This leads to\na higher rate of energy loss dE/dx due to ionization and a slower propagation time. By\nmeasuring dE/dx in the tracker or the time of flight in the tracking and muon chambers,\nit is possible to determine the velocity \u03b2 of the heavy state. The momentum of a charged\nstate can be obtained from the curvature of its track. Putting these measurements together\nallows for a precise determination of the mass of the heavy charged particle.\nThe detection of a heavy stable charged particle becomes more complicated if it is produced non-relativistically. For \u03b2 . 0.7 the tracking efficiency falls quickly. There is also a\ndanger of timing confusion between different events, since the LHC bunch crossing time of\n25 ns corresponds to the time taken for a particle with \u03b2 \u223c 0.7 to reach the ATLAS muon\nchambers [78, 80, 113, 128\u2013130]. On the other hand, very slowly moving charged states can\nstop in the detector or the surrounding region [601, 602]. If they decay at some point, it\nmay be possible to determine their decay lifetime [603, 604]. For the case of a metastable\n123\n\n\fcharged NLSP in gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking, such a measurement would also\ngive the mass of the light gravitino and the energy scale of supersymmetry breaking [605].\nQCD-charged quasi-stable particles have more complicated interactions in the detector.\nFrom Section II A 1 we know that such states can arise in the form of gluinos in split supersymmetry, as a squark of gluino NLSP in scenarios with gauge mediated supersymmetry\nbreaking, or from massive exotic quarks and other colored fermions or leptons in more general scenarios. In all these cases, the new strongly interacting states will be singly or pair\nproduced abundantly at hadron colliders. After creation, they will combine with quarks\nand gluons to form a heavy color-neutral R-hadron [88, 149, 606]. For example, a long-lived\ngluino will form g\u0303q q\u0304 0 and g\u0303g R-mesons, as well as g\u0303qqq R-baryons. The precise spectrum of\nthese states is not fully understood [607, 608]. For their collider phenomenology, the most important question is whether the lowest-lying particles carry an electric charge [113, 130, 609].\nThe answer is not known, and it is therefore important to study both charged and neutral\nR-hadrons. From these studies we know that both LHC detectors can discover charged massive R hadrons well into the TeV range and measure their masses at least at the per-cent\nlevel.\nA neutral R-hadron will pass through the detector relatively easily, depositing only a\nsmall amount of energy along the way. They can produce a signal of jets plus missing\nenergy when produced in association with hard jets [113, 610]. Charged R-hadrons produce\nvisible tracks in the tracking and muon chambers. These can be distinguished from genuine\nmuons at the LHC using the same techniques discussed above for uncolored massive charged\nparticles [113, 130, 610\u2013612]. An interesting further possibility is that neutral and charged Rhadrons can interchange when they interact with material in the detector producing 'dashed'\ntracks [610]. Slow-moving R-hadrons can potentially stop in the detector and become bound\nto nuclei [613]. These will lead to displaced jets that are out of time with beam collisions\nwhen they decay.\n\n124\n\n\fIV.\n\nMEASURING THE UNDERLYING THEORY\n\nMost modern scenarios of new physics designed to address the challenges listed in Section I propose a comprehensive and detailed extension of the Standard Model above the\nelectroweak scale. Such models impact a wealth of measurements at the LHC and other\nexperiments probing similar energy scales. The LHC will give us a great many information about these new physics scenarios, and it will certainly rule out large classes of these\ntheories, but it will definitely not give a one-to-one map between the limited number of\nhadron collider observables and a the full set of model parameters. Seriously testing any\nUV extension of the Standard Model therefore requires combining different experiments and\ninvestigating the features of the new physics parameter space from many angles.\nSome of the new-physics models discussed in Section II allow us to more easily determine\nthe underlying parameters than others. Some models give rise to singly-produced resonances\nwhich can be reconstructed to give precise mass measurements. Other theories produce\ncascade decays with missing energy and present a greater challenge to determining the\noverall mass scale of new physics. From an experimental point of view, some theories are\nsimply more suited to measurement by the LHC than others.\nOn the theory side, some models, such as the MSSM, represent a perturbative and renormalizable UV completion of the Standard Model up to very high energy scales where Grand\nUnification or quantum gravity are expected to distort the picture. Such theories have the\nadvantage that the higher dimensional operators which represent physics at still higher scales\nhave a negligible effect on LHC and related measurements. Other theories break down at\nlower energy scales, and consequently are more difficult to pin down, because the UV physics\nmay be relevant enough to subtly affect observations at the LHC.\nTo illustrate the process of measuring the underlying theory of new physics, we will\nconcentrate on a supersymmetric particle spectrum. However, the SUSY-focussed analysis\nwe present here rests on only few assumptions about the measurement process, and can be\napplied to a number of other promising scenarios as well. Our first assumption is that the new\nphysics mass spectrum is measured through the cascade decays of heavy strongly-interacting\nparticles into a weakly-interacting dark matter agent. Such mass measurements are heavily\ncorrelated because they rely on measuring kinematic endpoints. Secondly, we expect the\nnew physics parameter space to separate into a fraction that is well determined at the LHC,\nand a fraction that we will not see at the LHC, involving for example particles that are not\nobserved directly. And last but not least, we assume that the TeV-scale parameters can\nbe extrapolated reliably to higher energies using bottom-up renormalization group running.\nThe major question we address in this section is to what extent is it possible to uniquely\ndetermine the parameter values in a model of new physics using data from the LHC alone\nand including additional experiments.\nThe MSSM mass spectrum we study is the parameter point SPS1a [119], based on the\nmSUGRA framework described in Section II A 1, and which has been studied in detail by\nthe experimental community. It is somewhat on the easier side in terms of LHC parameter\ndetermination. This parameter point is characterized by moderately heavy squarks and\ngluinos, which decay through different long cascades including the neutralinos and sleptons\ndown to the lightest neutralino. The gauginos are lighter than the higgsinos, and the lightest\nHiggs mass is close to the LEP limit. The mass spectrum as well as projections for how well\n125\n\n\fmSPS1a LHC LC LHC+LC\nh\nA\n\u03c701\n\u03c703\n\u03c7\u00b1\n1\ng\u0303\nt\u03031\nb\u03031\nq\u0303L\n\u1ebdL\n\u03bc\u0303L\n\u03c4\u03031\n\u03bd\u0303e\n\n108.99\n393.26\n97.21\n356.01\n179.85\n607.81\n399.10\n518.87\n562.98\n199.66\n199.66\n133.35\n183.79\n\n0.25 0.05\n1.5\n4.8 0.05\n4.0\n0.55\n8.0\n2.0\n7.5\n8.7\n5.0 0.2\n5.0 0.5\n6.5 0.3\n1.2\n\n0.05\n1.5\n0.05\n4.0\n0.55\n6.5\n2.0\n5.7\n4.9\n0.2\n0.5\n0.3\n1.2\n\nmSPS1a LHC LC LHC+LC\nH\nH\u00b1\n\u03c702\n\u03c704\n\u03c7\u00b1\n2\n\n393.69\n401.88\n180.50 4.7\n375.59 5.1\n375.72\n\n1.5\n1.5\n1.2\n4.0\n3.0\n\n1.5\n1.5\n0.08\n2.3\n3.0\n\nb\u03032\nq\u0303R\n\u1ebdR\n\u03bc\u0303R\n\u03c4\u03032\n\n544.85\n543.82\n142.65\n142.65\n203.69\n\n7.9\n9.5\n4.8 0.05\n4.8 0.2\n1.1\n\n6.2\n8.0\n0.05\n0.2\n1.1\n\nTABLE IV: Errors for the mass determination in SPS1a. Shown are the nominal parameter values\n(from SuSpect [615]), the errors for the LHC alone, for the LC alone, and for a combined LHC+LC\nanalysis. Empty boxes indicate that the particle cannot, to current knowledge, be observed or is\ntoo heavy to be produced. All values are given in GeV. Table taken from Ref. [515].\n\nthese mass can be measured at the LHC and a 500 GeV e+ e\u2212 linear collider (LC) are listed\nin Table IV. While for this parameter point the dark matter relic density comes out slightly\ntoo large, it can be modified to include some amount of stau coannihilation to then agree\nwith all available experimental data today (SPS1a').\nThe LHC mass measurements in Table IV come from the kinematic endpoints and mass\ndifferences listed in Table V. The systematic error is essentially due to the uncertainty in\nthe lepton and jet energy scales, expected to be 0.1% and 1%, respectively. As discussed in\nSection III A, precision mass measurements at the LHC are not possible based production\nrates (i.e. \u03c3*BR). The reason for this are sizeable QCD uncertainties [87, 486, 614], largely\ndue to gluon radiation from the initial state, but by no means restricted to this one aspect\nof higher-order corrections. As argued in Section III A serious LHC results on new physics\ncan only be extracted with an appropriate understanding and simulation of QCD, which\nsuggests in turn that statements in the literature about LHC results should be interpreted\nwith care.\nFor a linear collider the rule of thumb is that if particles are light enough to be produced\nin pairs their masses can be determined with impressive accuracy. This rule is only violated\nby states without electroweak charges, like gluinos or heavy gluons. The mass determination\neither comes from direct reconstruction or from the cross section curve at threshold, with\ncomparable accuracy but different systematics. Precision measurements of branching ratios\nare also possible. We see from Table IV that indeed the LHC has a better coverage of\nthe strongly interacting sector, whereas the better coverage and precision in the weakly\ninteracting sector is achieved at a LC.\nFor the favorable SPS1a parameter point we can illustrate the ideal analysis scenario of\nnew physics in the LHC era.

Shown are the nominal values (from SuSpect [615])\nand statistical errors, systematic errors from the lepton (LES) and jet energy scale (JES) and\ntheoretical errors. All values are given in GeV. Table taken from Refs. [515, 617].\n\nrestrictive assumption that the underlying theory is mSUGRA, the LHC measurements will\nprovide strong correlations among the small number of underlying model parameters. Even\nso, we will see that it is realistic to expect several distinct likelihood maxima. This will only\nget worse for any proper TeV-scale ansatz.\nStarting from this exclusive likelihood map, we can apply frequentist and Bayesian constructions to define lower-dimensional probability distributions. Bayesian probabilities and\nprofile likelihoods are two ways to study an imperfectly measured parameter space, where\nsome model parameters might be very well determined, others heavily correlated, and even\nothers basically unconstrained. This is different for example from B physics, where theoretical degeneracies and symmetries have become a major challenge [290, 616]. A careful\ncomparison of the benefits and traps of both approaches in the light of new-physics searches\nis therefore helpful. Finally, we can attempt to reconstruct the TeV-scale Lagrangian with\nproper errors. Such TeV-scale results will then serve as starting points to a bottom-up probe\nof the underlying source of supersymmetry breaking or unification without theoretical bias.\nOur hope is that different experiments probing the same energy scales, like the LHC,\nelectric dipole moments, the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, flavor observables\nlike rare decays, and finally a future LC can be combined to measure as large a fraction of\nthe TeV-scale Lagrangian as possible.\nTechnically, our setup starts from the LHC and then adds more measurements. This\nreflects the time arrow as well as the feature that collider experiments are true multi-purpose\ndetectors with broader analyses strategies. We largely rely on SFitter [617] and Fittino [618]\nresults for TeV-scale parameter studies. However, in particular for the conceptual bases and\nfor mSUGRA toy analyses many other results are available [619\u2013622]. Unfortunately, there\n127\n\n\fis no similar analysis available for any of the other TeV-scale models discussed in Section II,\nwhich does not say much about the features of these models but is due to the level of\nexperimental involvement.\nA.\n\nParameter extraction\n\nWe all know from our first-year labs that it is impossible to compare interpretations with\ndata based purely on central values. No error bar means no measurement. For reliable\nerrors on new physics parameters we need a proper treatment of all errors. The complete\nset includes statistical experimental errors, systematic experimental errors, and theory errors. The statistical experimental errors can be treated as uncorrelated in the measured\nobservables. In contrast, the systematic experimental errors, such as from the jet and lepton\nenergy scales [515], are strongly correlated. Hence, both are non-trivially correlated if we extract masses from the measured endpoints. While at first sight it might be surprising, both\nexperimental errors can be approximated as gaussian. We can do this for the systematic\nerrors since they describe the detector or analysis response which is measured from Standard\nModel physics. This is why we bother looking at top quarks or W and Z bosons at the LHC\n\u2013 we do not expect to learn much new about them, but they allow us to understand the\ndetector.\nTheory errors arise when we compute observables like kinematic endpoints or rates from\nTeV-scale parameters or when we compute TeV-scale parameters from either other TeVscale parameters or from high-scale parameters. One problem with theory errors is that it is\ndifficult to reliably estimate the uncertainties due to unknown higher orders in perturbation\ntheory. A definite lower limit on a theory error is given by the dependence of observables\non unphysical renormalization and factorization scales. These scales arise at finite orders of\nperturbation theory, and the dependence on the scale choices has to vanish once we sum all\norders in the perturbative series. Therefore we can vary them within a 'reasonable range'\nto get an estimate of the theory error [9, 465].\nOne thing we do know about perturbative series is that there is no reason why the\nunknown higher-order corrections should be centered around a given value. Hence, theory\nerrors are taken to be box-shaped rather than gaussian: the probability assigned to any\nmeasurement does not depend on its actual value as long as it is within the interval covered\nby the theory error. The size of this box is of course negotiable. Tails could be attached\nto these theory-error distributions, but higher-order corrections are not expected to become\narbitrarily large if the perturbative expansion is to be useful. Taking this interval approach\nseriously impacts not only the distribution of the theory error, but also its combination with\nthe combined (gaussian) experimental error. Just integrating over the theory prediction\nnuisance parameter within the error band means a convolution of a box-shaped theory error\nwith a gaussian experimental error. It gives us the difference of two one-sided error functions.\nThis function has a maximum, so the convolution still knows about the central value of\ntheoretical prediction. Moreover, it requires a (Bayesian) measure in the cross section,\ngiving different results if we integrate over the number of events or over its logarithm.\nA better solution is the Rfit distribution used by CKMfitter [616], which is flat as long as\nthe measured value is within the theoretically acceptable interval and drops off outside like\nthe experimental gaussian. It corresponds to a profile likelihood construction marginalizing\nover the theory error bar. The log-likelihood given a set of measurements d~ and in the\n128\n\n\fpresence of a general correlation matrix C reads [616]\n\u03c72 = \u22122 log L = \u03c7\n~ Td C \u22121 \u03c7\n~d\n\uf8f1\n(theo)\n\uf8f4\n|di \u2212 d \u0304i | < \u03c3i\n\uf8f20\n\u03c7d,i = |di \u2212 d \u0304i | \u2212 \u03c3i(theo)\n(theo)\n\uf8f4\n|di \u2212 d \u0304i | > \u03c3i\n,\n\uf8f3\n(exp)\n\u03c3i\n\n(134)\n\nwhere d \u0304i is the i-th data point predicted by the model parameters and di is the actual\nmeasurement. Both experimental errors are summed quadratically. The statistical error is\nassumed to be uncorrelated between different measurements.\n1.\n\nSetup and mSUGRA toy analysis\n\nIt would be scientific cheating to assume a specific model for supersymmetry breaking for\nactual LHC parameter extraction analyses unless the goal is to test only such a particular\nmodel. Instead, the underlying structure of masses and couplings should be inferred from\ndata. However, attempting to fit the spectrum using a simple mSUGRA Ansatz for the\nunderlying structure of the soft parameters allows us to identify many key features of a\nreal TeV-scale new physics analysis. A given fit in this framework determines the most\nlikely values of the input parameters m0 , m1/2 , A0 , and tan \u03b2 [119] defined at the input scale\nMGUT \u223c 1016 GeV from mass or endpoint measurements at the LHC. The correct sign of\n\u03bc is determined by the quality of the fit. This small number of theory parameters greatly\nsimplifies the analysis compared to a proper MSSM analysis, and serves as a convenient way\nto begin investigating the statistical method of parameter scans.\nStrictly speaking, the mSUGRA toy map covers the parameters m0 , m1/2 , A0 , B\u03bc, and\nmt , where B\u03bc is traded for the TeV-scale tan \u03b2, as described in Section IV A 2. Similarly, the\n\u03bc parameter is traded for the electroweak VEV v = 174 GeV. Usually, we show our results\nin terms of tan \u03b2 because it has a more obvious relationship to observables. The running top\nYukawa is defined at the high scale as one of the mSUGRA model parameters, which after\nrenormalization group running predicts low-scale masses like the top mass, the superpartner\nmasses, or the light Higgs mass [623]. This approach should be taken for all Standard Model\nparameters [619], couplings and masses, but their errors are small compared to the error on\nthe top mass (LHC target: 1 GeV; LC target: 0.12 GeV).\nExamining the projections for the SPS1a parameter point at the LHC, we find that several\nparameters are heavily correlated while some are only poorly constrained, and distinct loglikelihood maxima can differ by O(1\u221210). The first question is always if whether we can\nunambiguously identify the correct parameters from a set of observables and their errors,\neven in the simplified mSUGRA context. In other words, which parameter point has the\nlargest likelihood value p(d|m), evaluated as a function over the model space m for given data\nd. Discrete model assumptions - like mSUGRA vs extra dimensions - are not included in\nthis question.\nIn Fig. 47 we show the best-fit points in the mSUGRA parameter space, as obtained from\nthe 5-dimensional likelihood map. A general pattern of four distinct maxima emerges as a\nresult of two degeneracies: for the first, the trilinear coupling can assume the correct value\nof around A0 ' \u2212100 GeV, but it can also become large and positive. This is correlated\nwith a slight shift in the top mass and is due to the light Higgs mass, so it depends on\n129\n\n\fm0\n102.0\n104.8\n108.1\n112.1\n\nm1/2\n254.0\n242.1\n266.4\n261.0\n\ntan \u03b2\n11.5\n12.9\n14.6\n18.0\n\nA0\n-95.2\n-174.4\n742.4\n632.6\n\n\u03bc\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n\n1000\n\nmt\n172.4\n172.3\n173.7\n173.0\n\n1e+07\n800\n100000\nm1/2\n\n\u03c72\n0.09\n1.50\n73.2\n139.5\n...\n\n600\n\n1000\n\n400\n\n10\n\n200\n0\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\n1/\u03c72\n\n1/\u03c72\n\nm0\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n0\n\nm0\n\n200\n\n400\n600\nm1/2\n\n800\n\n1000\n\nFIG. 47: Profile likelihoods for mSUGRA.

Secondly, the sign of \u03bc and a slight shift in tan \u03b2\ncompensate each other in the neutralino-chargino sector. Such a degeneracy is worsened at\nthe LHC where only one of the two heavy neutralinos are observed. Including more precise\nmeasurements from the linear collider might remove this degeneracy [624].\nIn Fig. 47 we see how the significantly different \u03c72 values would allow us to distinguish\nthese four candidate mSUGRA solutions. Amusingly, changing the theory errors from the\ncorrect flat distribution to a possibly approximate gaussian shape affects the ranking of the\nmaxima for our smeared measurements: for gaussian theory errors \u03c72 values of 4.35, 26.1,\n10.5, 22.6 appear in the order shown in Fig. 47. Given that just smearing the measurements\ncan shift the ordering of the best local maxima, it is important to study carefully more than\njust the best solution and its local vicinity.\nFor a complete analysis we also want to compute probability distributions or likelihoods\nover subspaces of the model space. In other words, we would like to eliminate dimensions of\nthe parameter space until only one- or two-dimensional distributions remain. The likelihood\ncannot just be integrated unless we define an integration measure in the model space. This\nmeasure introduces a prior and leads us to a Bayesian probability. To avoid this prior, we first\ndefine the profile likelihood: for each binned parameter point in the (n\u22121)\u2013dimensional space\nwe explore the nth direction which is to be removed L(x1,...,n\u22121 , xn ). Along this direction we\npick the best value of Lmax(n) and identify its value with the lower-dimensional parameter\npoint L(x1,...,n\u22121 ) \u2261 Lmax(n) (x1,...,n\u22121 , xn ). This projection most notably guarantees that the\nbest-fit points survive best to the final representation. On the other hand, profile likelihoods\nare not probability distributions because they do not protect the normalization of the original\n130\n\n\fm0\n102.0\n104.8\n108.1\n112.1\n\nm1/2\n254.0\n242.1\n266.4\n261.0\n\ntan \u03b2\n11.5\n12.9\n14.6\n18.0\n\nA0\n-95.2\n-174.4\n742.4\n632.6\n\n\u03bc\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n\n1000\n\nmt\n172.4\n172.3\n173.7\n173.0\n\n1e+07\n800\nm1/2\n\n\u03c72\n0.09\n1.50\n73.2\n139.5\n...\n\n600\n\n100000\n\n400\n\n1000\n\n200\n0\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1.6e-05\n1.4e-05\n1.2e-05\n1e-05\n8e-06\n6e-06\n4e-06\n2e-06\n0\n\n3.5e-05\n3e-05\n2.5e-05\n1/\u03c72\n\n1/\u03c72\n\nm0\n\n2e-05\n1.5e-05\n1e-05\n5e-06\n0\n\n0\n\n200 400 600 800 1000\nm0\n\n0\n\n200 400 600 800 1000\nm1/2\n\nFIG. 48: Bayesian probabilities for mSUGRA.

The maximum starts from the\ntrue values m0 = 100 GeV and m1/2 = 250 GeV and continues along two branches. They\nreflect the fact that extracting masses from kinematic endpoints involves quadratic equations. Ignoring such correlations, we can project the two-dimensional profile likelihood onto\neach of the remaining directions. Both distributions show sharp maxima in the correct\nplaces because the resolution is not sufficient to resolve the four distinct solutions for A0\nand sign(\u03bc).\nA likelihood analysis is unfortunately not designed to produce probability distributions\nand to answer questions such as which sign of \u03bc is preferred in mSUGRA, in light of precision\nelectroweak bounds and dark matter constraints [625]. Note that this is not the same\nquestion as what the relative difference in the likelihood for the two best points on each\nside of \u03bc is. To answer the first question the likelihood over each half of the parameter\nspace needs to be integrated. For such an integration we introduce an integration measure\nor Bayesian prior. This has its advantages, but it can also lead to unexpected effects [619].\nOne might argue that such questions are irrelevant because our goal is to find the correct (i.e.\nthe most likely) parameter point. On the other hand, asking for a reduced-dimensionality\nprobability density could well be a very typical situation in the LHC era. Questions such\nas what is the most likely mechanism for dark matter annihilation deserve a well-defined\nanswer.\n131\n\n\f100000\n10000\n1000\n100\n10\n1\n\n180\n\n180\n\n170\n\n170\n\n160\n\n160\n\n-1000\n\n-500\n\n0\n\n500\nA0\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n-1000\n\n100000\n10000\n1000\n100\n10\n1\n\n200\n190\nmt\n\n190\n\n180\n\n160\n\n160\n0\n\n500\nA0\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n500\nA0\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n100000\n10000\n1000\n100\n10\n1\n\n180\n170\n\n-500\n\n0\n\n190\n\n170\n\n-1000\n\n-500\n\n200\n\nmt\n\nmt\n\n190\n\n100000\n10000\n1000\n100\n10\n1\n\n200\n\nmt\n\n200\n\n2000\n\n-1000\n\n-500\n\n0\n\n500\nA0\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\nFIG. 49: Profile likelihoods (upper) and Bayesian probabilities (lower) for A0 and yt .

[617].\n\nShifting from a frequentist to a Bayesian approach does not affect the actual likelihood\nmap, aside from possible differences in the treatment and combination of errors or nuisance\nparameters. Therefore, the top-likelihood points from Fig. 47 also appear in the Bayesianbased Fig. 48. The second panel in Fig. 48 now shows a two-dimensional representation of\nthe Bayesian probability over the mSUGRA parameter space. All parameters except for m0\nand m1/2 are marginalized using flat priors. We observe the same two-branch structure as\nfor the profile likelihood. However, there are two differences. First, the area around the\ntrue parameter point is less pronounced in the Bayesian probability. The integration over\nparameter space collects noise from large regions with a finite but insignificant likelihood.\nThis washes out the peaks, while the profile likelihood by construction ignores poor-fit areas.\nThis effect also considerably smears the one-dimensional Bayesian probabilities. Secondly,\nthe branch structure is more pronounced in Fig. 48. While in the profile likelihood the\ncompact area between the branches is filled by single good parameter points, the Bayesian\nmarginalization provides 'typical' likelihood values in this region which in general does not\nfit the data as well.\nEliminating a dimension in any parameter space means loss of information. Fig. 49 shows\nthe two-dimensional profile likelihoods in the mt \u2013A0 subspace for each sign of \u03bc. Locally, the\ntwo-dimensional profile likelihoods around the maxima show little correlation between mt\nand A0 . The correct value is preferred, but the alternative solution around A0 \u223c 700 GeV\nis clearly visible. On top of this double-maximum structure, for both signs of \u03bc there is a\nparabola-shaped correlation between mt and A0 with an apex roughly 5 GeV above the best\nfits in mt . This correlation becomes invisible once we project away one of the two parameter\n132\n\n\fSPS1a \u2206theo-exp\n\u2206expNoCorr\n\u2206theo-exp\n\u2206theo-exp\nzero\nzero\nzero\nflat\nmasses\nendpoints\nm0\n100 4.11\n1.08\n0.50\n2.17\nm1/2\n250 1.81\n0.98\n0.73\n2.64\ntan \u03b2\n10 1.69\n0.87\n0.65\n2.45\nA0\n-100 36.2\n23.3\n21.2\n49.6\nmt\n171.4 0.94\n0.79\n0.26\n0.97\nTABLE VI: Best-fit results for mSUGRA at the LHC derived from masses and endpoint measurements with absolute errors in GeV.

Table taken from Ref. [617]\n\ndirections. As usual, we compare the profile likelihood and the Bayesian probability for\nA0 and see that volume effects in the latter significantly enhance the relative weight of the\nsecondary maximum. Moreover, comparing the likelihood scales for \u03bc < 0 and (the correct)\n\u03bc > 0 values, the relative enhancement of the Bayesian probability is by almost an order\nof magnitude, while the profile likelihoods for the two best-fit points differ by only a factor\nfive.\nTo determine model parameters, two different measurement sets are available at the\nLHC: kinematic endpoints, or particle masses from a fit to the endpoints without model\nassumptions [499\u2013501]. Because the extraction of masses from endpoints is highly correlated,\nboth approaches are only equivalent if the complete correlation matrix of masses is taken into\naccount. For the mSUGRA toy model we can compare the endpoint results with an ansatz\nwhere we use the masses while forgetting about their correlations. Again, this question is\ncompletely independent of the supersymmetric framework - the question is what kind of\nmeasurements we should use to extract mass spectra from cascade decays.\nTypical errors on the mSUGRA parameters for different assumptions are shown in Table VI. Switching from mass measurements to endpoints for gaussian experimental errors\nand no correlations improves the precision by more than a factor two. This improvement\narises from the absence of the correlation matrix between the mass observables. If this\nmatrix were known, the two results would be similar. Taking into account the correlation\nof the systematic energy-scale errors gives us another improvement by a factor two for m0 .\nIncluding theory uncertainties increases the combined error bars on the experimentally wellmeasured scalar and gaugino masses considerably. For tan \u03b2 the theory error on the light\nHiggs mass of about 2 GeV is the dominant source, coming from the uncertainty in the top\nYukawa as well as unknown higher orders [623]. The top-pole mass measurement at the LHC\nis expected to give an experimental error of about 1 GeV, and as long as the experimental\nerror stays in this range, the theory error on the top mass from the unknown renormalization\nscheme of mt at a hadron collider [626] should be small, due to \u03bbQCD \u001c GeV. This simple\nexample shows how important a proper treatment of errors can be, in particular in analyses\nwhere the experimental measurements are precise and complex.\n\n133\n\n\f7e-06\n\n2.5e-06\n\n6e-06\n\n2e-06\n\n4e-06\n\n1/\u03c72\n\n1/\u03c7\n\n2\n\n5e-06\n3e-06\n\n1.5e-06\n1e-06\n\n2e-06\n5e-07\n\n1e-06\n0\n\n0\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n20\ntan(\u03b2)\n\n25\n\n30\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15 20\ntan(\u03b2)\n\n25\n\n30\n\nFIG. 50: Bayesian probabilities for tan \u03b2 with a flat prior in B (left) and a flat prior in tan \u03b2\n(right). Figure taken from Ref. [617].\n2.\n\nOnce high scale always high scale\n\nA Bayesian analysis with its priors can depend on the way we define our models in\ndetail. The usual set of mSUGRA model parameters contains the high-scale mass parameters\nm0 , m1/2 , A0 , and on the other hand the TeV-scale ratio of vacuum expectation values tan \u03b2,\nwhich assumes radiative electroweak symmetry breaking. Minimizing the potential in the\ndirections of both VEVs gives the two conditions [627]:\nm2Hu sin2 \u03b2 \u2212 m2Hu cos2 \u03b2 1 2\n\u2212 mZ\ncos 2\u03b2\n2\n\u0001\n2\n2\n2\n2B\u03bc = tan 2\u03b2 mHd \u2212 mHu + mZ sin 2\u03b2\n\u03bc2 =\n\n(135)\n\nThe masses mHu,d are the soft masses of the two Higgs doublets. These are fixed in mSUGRA\nby the value of m0 at the high input scale, so with this and by specifying tan \u03b2 we can\neliminate B\u03bc and |\u03bc|.\nAnother approach is to replace tan \u03b2 with B\u03bc at the high scale together with m0 and\ncompute tan \u03b2 and |\u03bc| assuming electroweak symmetry breaking and the Z mass. Now\nall input parameters are high-scale mass parameters. This does not make a difference for\nfrequentist profile-likelihood map, but in a Bayesian approach it does matter through volume\neffects. To illustrate the effects of flat priors either in B\u03bc or in tan \u03b2 we show one-dimensional\nBayesian tan \u03b2 probabilities in Fig. 50. From the best-fit points in Fig. 47 even after including\ntheory errors the correct value for tan \u03b2 can be determined. However, Fig. 50 clearly shows\nthat with a flat prior in B the one-dimensional Bayesian probability is largely dominated by\nnoise and by a bias towards as small as possible tan \u03b2. This bias is simply an effect of the\nprior. Switching to a flat prior in tan \u03b2, noise effects are still dominant, but the maximum\nof the one-dimensional Bayesian probability is in the correct place. As expected, the profile\nlikelihood picks the correct central value of tan \u03b2 \u223c 12 for the smeared parameter point.\n3.\n\nTeV-scale MSSM\n\nIf any kind of new physics should be observed at the TeV scale, we need to determine as\nmany of its model parameters as possible to understand the underlying structure. High-scale\nmodels can then be inferred from TeV-scale data [617, 618, 628\u2013630].

All masses are given in GeV. The \u03c72 value for all points is approximately the\nsame, so the ordering of the table is arbitrary. The parameter point closest to the correct point is\nlabeled as SPS1a. Table taken from Ref. [617]\n\neven at multi-purpose experiments like the LHC we can ignore some new-physics parameters\nbecause no information about them is expected. Such parameters will likely include CPviolating phases already constrained by searches for electric dipole moments [110] or similarly\nconstrained non-symmetric flavor structures [631]. It could also include parameters which in\na chiral model are proportional to light Yukawa couplings, like the light-generation trilinear\ncouplings Al,u,d in supersymmetry. Third-generation A\u03c4,b can in principle play a role as\noff-diagonal entries in mass matrices, and their effects could be easier to observe, but they\nare usually subleading compared to At . Applying these arguments leads to an effective 19\u2013\ndimensional TeV-scale MSSM parameter space listed for example in Table VII. Obviously,\nsuch an assumption of parameters being irrelevant for the TeV-scale likelihood map can and\nmust be tested.\nIn Table VII we show the set of secondary local maxima in a likelihood map to the\nSPS1a parameter under the assumption of a general 19\u2013parameter TeV scale MSSM. The\nmost interesting feature of the different best-fitting points is the structure of the neutralino\nsector. For a fixed sign of \u03bc, four equally good solutions can be classified by the ordering\nof the mass parameters, even though M1 < M2 < |\u03bc| is the correct solution. The reverse\nordering of the two gaugino masses M2 < M1 < |\u03bc| is equally likely. In both cases the\n135\n\n\fmissing neutralino will be a higgsino. Apart from these two light-gaugino scenarios, the\nsecond-lightest neutralino can be mostly a higgsino, which corresponds to M1 < |\u03bc| < M2\nand M2 < |\u03bc| < M1 . Note that given a set of LHC measurements the two gaugino masses\ncan always be switched as long as there are no chargino constraints, even though we will see\nin Section IV D that the gaugino and higgsino fraction usually decide if we are looking at\na model with a viable dark matter candidate or not. The one neutralino which cannot be\na higgsino is the LSP, because in that case \u03bc would also affect the second neutralino mass\nand would have to be heavily tuned, leading to a considerably larger smaller likelihood. The\nshift in tan \u03b2 for the correct SPS1a parameter point is an effect of the smeared data set\ncombined with the rather poor constraints on this parameter and is within the errors.\nGoing back to Table V we see an important feature: there are 22 measurements which\nshould naively completely constrain our 19\u2013dimensional parameter space. However, all measurements are constructed from only 15 underlying masses. Five model parameters turn out\nto be poorly constrained. For small tan \u03b2 one problem is the heavy Higgs mass mA . Other\nhardly determined parameters are Mt\u0303R and At , which occur in the stop sector but not in any\nof the edge measurements. Number four is tan \u03b2. Looking at the neutralino and sfermion\nmixing matrices, any effect in changing tan \u03b2 can always be accommodated by a change elsewhere. This is particularly obvious in the stau sector. There, only the lighter of M\u03c4\u0303L or M\u03c4\u0303R\nis determined from the m\u03c4 \u03c4 edge. The heavier mass parameter and tan \u03b2 can compensate\neach other's effects freely.\nA fairly typical situation is that there is exactly one measurement which strongly links\nall these five otherwise unconstrained parameters: the lightest Higgs mass. It defines a\nfour-dimensional surface with a constant likelihood that fixes the range of all parameters\ninvolved. To illustrate the effect of the minimum surface we quote two values for At in the\ntable of minima. The significant shift in |At | shows the sizeable correlations with the other\nparameters. Its origin is the stop contribution to the lightest Higgs mass which contains\nsub-leading terms linear in At . If this minimum surface can be constrained by further\nmeasurements, this degeneracy will vanish and correlations will require the other parameters\nto shift, in order to accommodate two distinct point-like minima. However, until we find a\nway to distinguish these alternative minima, all secondary best-fit points in the TeV-scale\nMSSM have exactly the same (perfect) likelihood, which is the most important qualitative\ndifference to a highly constrained model like mSUGRA.\nAccording to the measurements listed in Table IV, the LHC will only identify three out\nof four neutralinos - the third-heaviest neutralino we will miss due to its higgsino nature.\nThis situation might be typical at the LHC, where there is no guarantee that we will be able\nto see all the particles of the weakly interacting new-physics sector. The question is what\nhappens if the fourth-heaviest neutralino is wrongly labeled as third-heaviest. Obviously,\nfollowing the above discussion we always find a best-fitting parameter point. Two fits with\nthe correct and swapped neutralino mass assignments are shown in Table VIII. There are\nsmall shifts in all parameters entering the neutralino mass matrix, but none of them appear\nsignificant. The shift in tan \u03b2 is an effect of the smeared parameter point. The relatively\nlarge shift in the heavy Higgs mass between the two scenarios will turn out to be well within\nthe wide error bands. In contrast, the lightest Higgs mass in both points is identical, which\nmeans that for the typical LHC precision the parameter point SPS1a is in the decoupling\nlimit of the heavy MSSM Higgs states.\nThe key to distinguishing alternative minima is predicting more properties of the 'wrong'\n136\n\n\fSPS1a correct inverted\nM1\nM3\nmA\nM\u1ebdL\nM\u03bc\u0303L\nM\u03c4\u0303L\nMq\u0303L\nMq\u03033L\n\n103.1\n577.9\n394.9\n194.4\n194.4\n193.6\n526.6\n480.8\n\nAl1,2 -251.1\nAd1,2 -821.8\nAu1,2 -657.2\nmt\n171.4\n\n102.1\n582.0\n394.0\n192.3\n191.0\n192.9\n527.0\n477.9\n\n101.6\n582.1\n299.3\n192.3\n191.0\n185.7\n527.1\n478.5\n\nfixed\nfixed\nfixed\n172.2\n\n0\n0\n0\n172.2\n\nSPS1a correct inverted\nM2\ntan \u03b2\n\u03bc\nM\u1ebdR\nM\u03bc\u0303R\nM\u03c4\u0303R\nMq\u0303R\nMt\u0303R\nMb\u0303R\nA\u03c4\nAb\nAt\n\n192.9 193.6\n191.0\n10.0\n7.2\n7.8\n353.7 347.7\n369.3\n135.8 134.8\n134.8\n135.8 134.7\n134.7\n133.4 128.1\n129.9\n508.1 514.8\n514.9\n408.3 423.6\n187.6\n502.9 513.7\n513.2\n-249.4\nfixed 0\n-763.4\nfixed 0\n-490.9 -487.7 -484.9\n\nTABLE VIII: Result for the MSSM parameter determination using the LHC endpoint measurements assuming either the third or fourth neutralino to be missing.

For example, it should be possible to search for higgsinos in cascade decays involving gauge bosons.\nSuch a measurement or non-measurement would remove this particular degeneracy. The\nsame would be true for chargino masses which unfortunately are not part of the standard\nSPS1a sample [632]. Relying on such non-measurements poses a big problem for any kind of\nautomized approach. What can and what cannot be seen at the LHC is largely determined\nby Standard Model backgrounds and detector effects. Either a detailed analysis or serious\nexperimental intuition will be needed, making an automated answering algorithm for such\nquestions unrealistic.\nIn Fig. 51 we show the profile likelihoods for M1,2 and \u03bc. The M1 \u2013\u03bc and M1 \u2013M2 planes\nreflect the different hierarchies in the neutralino mass parameters: one of the two gaugino\nmasses corresponds to the measured LSP mass while the other gaugino mass can in principle decouple. In the M1 \u2013\u03bc plane the three neutralino masses can be identified in the M1\ndirections. For light M1,2 the higgsino mass parameter |\u03bc| can be large, while for one heavy\ngaugino |\u03bc| needs to be small. The one-dimensional profile likelihood for example for M1\nagain shows these three scenarios with peaks around 100, 200 and 350 GeV, corresponding\nto the three measured neutralino masses. The peak above 400 GeV is an alternative likelihood maximum which does not correspond to a measured neutralino mass. For M2 there is\nagain the 100 GeV peak, where the LSP is a wino. The correct solution around 200 GeV\nis merged with the first maximum, while the third peak around 300 GeV corresponds to at\nleast one light higgsino.\nThe sfermion and neutralino masses appearing in long cascades are correlated, reflecting\nthe result from Section III B 1 that mass differences are better constrained by decay kinematics than absolute mass values. However, it turns out that for example the correlation\nof the squark and slepton masses is numerically insignificant compared to noise effects and\nalternative maxima in the profile likelihood. The one-dimensional profile likelihood for the\nsquark mass parameter, however, is clearly peaked around the correct value.\n137\n\n\f1000\n\n1000\n1e+08\n1e+06\n\n1e+06\n600\n\n10000\n\nM2\n\n10000\n\n0\n\n\u03bc\n\n1e+08\n800\n\n500\n\n400\n\n100\n-500\n\n100\n\n200\n\n-1000\n\n0\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\nM1\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\nM1\n\n1000\n\n1000\n1e+09\n\n1e+09\n800\n\n500\n\u03bc\n\n600\n\n1e+07\n\n400\n\n100000\n\nM2\n\n1e+07\n0\n100000\n-500\n\n200\n\n-1000\n\n0\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\nM1\n\n0.002\n\n0.004\n\n0.004\n1/\u03c7\n\n0.002\n\n0.002\n\n0.001\n\n0.001\n\n0\n400 600\nM1\n\n800 1000\n7e-07\n\n5e-07\n\n6e-07\n\n200\n\n400 600\nM2\n\n800 1000\n\n2\n\n1/\u03c7\n\n2\n\n2e-07\n\n4e-07\n3e-07\n2e-07\n\n1e-07\n\n1e-07\n\n0\n\n0\n400 600\nM1\n\n800 1000\n\n0.0015\n0.001\n\n0\n\n5e-07\n\n3e-07\n\n200\n\n1000\n\n0\n0\n\n6e-07\n\n0\n\n800\n\n0.0005\n\n0\n200\n\n4e-07\n1/\u03c7\n\n0.003\n\n1/\u03c72\n\n1/\u03c7\n\n0.003\n\n1/\u03c72\n\n0.0025\n\n0.005\n2\n\n0.006\n\n0.005\n2\n\n0.006\n\n0\n\n600\nM1\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400 600\nM2\n\n800 1000\n\n200\n\n400 600\nqL\n\n800 1000\n\n4.5e-06\n4e-06\n3.5e-06\n3e-06\n2.5e-06\n2e-06\n1.5e-06\n1e-06\n5e-07\n0\n0\n\n200 400 600 800 1000\nqL\n\nFIG. 51: Profile likelihoods (respective upper panels) and Bayesian probabilities (respective lower\npanels) for the MSSM.

The two lower peaks in M2 appear as one, with a maximum around\n150 GeV. The second difference is that the Bayesian probability answers the question of\n\n138\n\n\fLHC\ntan \u03b2 10.0\u00b1\n4.5\nM1\n102.1\u00b1\n7.8\nM2\n193.3\u00b1\n7.8\nM3\n577.2\u00b1 14.5\n\u00b1\nAl1,2\nfixed 0\nA\u03c4\nfixed 0\nAu1,2\nfixed 0\nAt\n-509.1\u00b1 86.7\nAb\nfixed 0\nAd1,2\nfixed 0\nmA\n406.3\u00b1O(103 )\nmt\n171.4\u00b1\n1.0\n\nSPS1a\n10.0\n103.1\n192.9\n577.9\n-251.1\n-249.4\n-657.2\n-490.9\n-763.4\n-821.8\n394.9\n171.4\n\nM\u03c4\u0303L\nM\u03c4\u0303R\nM\u03bc\u0303L\nM\u03bc\u0303R\nM\u1ebdL\nM\u1ebdR\nMq\u03033L\nMt\u0303R\nMb\u0303R\nMq\u0303L\nMq\u0303R\n\u03bc\n\nLHC\n227.8\u00b1O(103 )\n164.1\u00b1O(103 )\n193.2\u00b1\n8.8\n135.0\u00b1\n8.3\n193.3\u00b1\n8.8\n135.0\u00b1\n8.3\n481.4\u00b1 22.0\n415.8\u00b1O(102 )\n501.7\u00b1 17.9\n524.6\u00b1 14.5\n507.3\u00b1 17.5\n350.5\u00b1 14.5\n\u00b1\n\nSPS1a\n193.6\n133.4\n194.4\n135.8\n194.4\n135.8\n480.8\n408.3\n502.9\n526.6\n508.1\n353.7\n\nTABLE IX: Result for the general MSSM parameter determination in SPS1a assuming flat theory\nerrors. The kinematic endpoint measurements are given in Tab. V. Shown are the nominal parameter values and the result after the LHC fit. All masses are given in GeV. Table taken from\nRef. [617]\n\nwhich neutralino is the most likely to be bino-like. While for M1 the best profile-likelihood\nentry lies around 350 GeV, the Bayesian probability shows a clear maximum for the input\nvalue around 100 GeV.\nIn both approaches the difference between the two signs of \u03bc is small, but for the Bayesian\nprobabilities |\u03bc| is clearly driven to small values by volume effects. This arises because of\nthe decoupling of one of the two gaugino masses for a light higgsino, while for two light\ngauginos the higgsino mass is still determined by the fourth neutralino. The squark mass\nagain shows the expected behavior: the profile likelihood is much more strongly peaked than\nthe Bayesian probability.\nA crucial result of any parameter extraction are the errors on the extracted model parameters. The flat theory errors are now only TeV-scale uncertainties, for example due to\nthe translation of mass parameters into physical masses or due to higher-order effects in\nthe observables. For one best-fit parameter point (the correct one), we show the results for\nthe error determination in Table IX. As discussed above, the LHC is insensitive to several\nparameters. Some of them, namely the trilinear mixing terms Ai , are already fixed in the\nfit. Others, like the heavier stau-mass and stop-mass parameters or the pseudoscalar Higgs\nmass, turn out to be unconstrained. Since the heavy Higgses are often effectively decoupled\nas far as the relevant LHC signatures are concerned, the parameters in the Higgs sector are\ntan \u03b2 and the lightest stop mass which we cannot determine well just from mh . Theory\nerrors already degrade the precision in the Higgs mass by a factor of about two. In particular the m`` theory error dominates over the corresponding experimental error. On the\nother hand, we do see that particularly in the strongly interacting new-physics sector the\nLHC shows an impressive coverage of parameters determined largely from cascade decays.\nA higher experimental precision on these masses would require us to deal with the question\nof what kind of parameter we actually measure, i.e. what kind if renormalization scheme do\nwe use for cascade decays [514].\n139\n\n\fM sfermions (GeV)\n\nM gaugino (GeV)\n\n600\nGaugino masses\n\n500\n\nM1\nM2\n\n400\n\nM3\n\n600\nselectron and smuon L\n\n500\n\nlight squarks L\n\n400\n\n300\n\n300\n\n200\n\n200\n\n100\n\n100\n\n0\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n0\n\n16\nlog(Q/GeV)\n\nselectron and smuon R\n\nlight squarks R\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\nlog(Q/GeV)\n\nFIG. 52: Upward renormalization group running of the three gaugino masses (left) and the scalar\nmasses (right) assuming only LHC measurements in the parameter point SPS1a. Figures taken\nfrom Ref. [640]\n4.\n\nTesting unification\n\nOnce we have determined the parameters of a TeV-scale Lagrangian, the next step is to\nextrapolate these parameters to higher energy scales. This way we can attempt to study the\nunderlying fundamental interactions and symmetries. If the fundamental theory of particles\nis renormalizable and perturbative, this extrapolation is crucial. Inspired by the apparent\ngauge coupling unification [633] in the MSSM, which itself can be tested at the LHC [634],\nit is sensible to ask whether any other model parameters unify as well [635, 636]. For two\nreasons, the prime candidates for unification are the gaugino masses. First, in contrast to\nthe scalar masses, the three gaugino masses can well be argued to belong to a unifying gauge\nsector. Second, interactions between the hidden SUSY-breaking sector or other sources of\nnew physics and the MSSM particle content can disturb the unification pattern of the scalars,\nbut have a much smaller effect on the gauginos [637]. In that case, scalar mass unification\nmight have to be replaced by much less obvious sum rules for scalar masses at some high\nscale [630, 638].\nTechnically, upwards running is considerably more complicated [615, 639] than starting\nfrom a unification-scale and testing the unification hypothesis by comparing to the TeV-scale\nparticle spectrum. It is by no means guaranteed that the renormalization group running will\nconverge for TeV-scale input values far away from the top-down prediction. In Figure 52\nwe show the extrapolation of the central values of the gaugino and scalar mass parameters\nusing SuSpect. As expected in SPS1a, the mass parameters unify at the GUT scale provided\nwe pick the correct solution [640].\nB.\n\nCombination with (g\u22122)\u03bc\n\nAs discussed in Section IV A 3, the full new physics spectrum might not be directly\nobservable at the LHC. A further probe that we can combine with LHC measurements is the\nanomalous magnetic moment of the muon, which currently provides a suggestive hint for new\nphysics beyond the Standard Model. This parameter has been measured experimentally [641]\n140\n\n\fand computed in the Standard Model [642] to an extremely high precision:\na(exp)\n\u2261 (g\u22122)\u03bc /2 = 116592080(63) \u00d7 10\u221211\n\u03bc\na(SM)\n= 116591785(61) \u00d7 10\u221211\n\u03bc\n\n(136)\n\nWe use e+ e\u2212 data instead of the alternative tau data [643]. This difference between experiment and the Standard model prediction might well be a new-physics effect.\nSupersymmetry provides a particularly attractive explanation of this discrepancy. New\nloop corrections arise in supersymmetry that involve a neutralino (chargino) and a smuon\n(\u03bc-sneutrino), and that depend on \u03bc, tan \u03b2, and the slepton masses. For somewhat large\nvalues of tan \u03b2 and sleptons on the order of a few hundred GeV, these corrections can bring\nthe theoretically predicted value of a\u03bc in line with the observed value [644]. This mass\nrange could well be accessible at the LHC. Taking this apparent discrepancy seriously and\ncombining the measurement with other data will allow us to further constrain the allowed\nmodel parameters. Indeed, for supersymmetry the leading correction to (g\u22122) is proportional\nto tan \u03b2 and to the sign of \u03bc and provides exactly the kind of information on the MSSM\nparameter space which is likely to be difficult to obtain from LHC data.\nIf tan \u03b2 is determined at the LHC, the value of (g\u22122)\u03bc will instead provide an important\ncross-check of the structure of the model. For large enough values of tan \u03b2, it can potentially\nbe measured at the LHC through the production and decays of the heavy Higgs bosons [645,\n646]. This measurement is sensitive to the re-scaled bottom Yukawa coupling yb tan \u03b2 with\nits universal renormalization corrections \u2206b [152]. Combining all errors, for Higgs masses\nbelow \u223c 500 GeV and tan \u03b2 & 20 we arrive at a total error of 12% to 16% on the bbA/bbH\nYukawa coupling, which is proportional to tan \u03b2 [645]. As discussed in Section III A, such a\n(\u03c3 \u00d7 BR) measurement suffers from sizeable and hard to estimate QCD uncertainties.\nTo illustrate how to combine the (g\u22122)\u03bc measurement with LHC data, we again turn to\n(SPS1a)\n(SM)\nthe SPS1a parameter point [119]. Its theory prediction is a\u03bc\n= a\u03bc + 282 \u00d7 10\u221211 , a\ndeviation of \u2206a\u03bc = \u221213 \u00d7 10\u221211 from the experimentally observed value and well inside the\nexperimental error bounds. Therefore, we can safely use the current experimental value as\na hypothetical measurement, and estimate its impact not only on the best-fitting parameter\npoint but more importantly on the errors on the MSSM parameters.\nTable X shows the result of a SPS1a analysis. For comparison we also include the result\nwithout (g \u2212 2)\u03bc and results with experimental errors only. The effect of the additional\ninformation on the accuracy of the parameter determination is impressive, particularly for\ntan \u03b2. This parameter it is not well determined by the kinematic endpoints at all, and\n(g \u2212 2)\u03bc shrinks its error bar by more than a factor of two. This improvement impacts\nall parameters which are re-rotated when tan \u03b2 is changed to reproduce the same physical\nobservables shown in Table V. Correlations and loop corrections propagate this improvement\nover almost the complete parameter space.\nC.\n\nCombination with flavor\n\nFollowing the last section, a third way of determining tan \u03b2 are flavor observables such\nas the rare decay Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 .

These will provide us with one of the most carefully\nstudied set of measurements which we can combine with high-pT LHC measurements. This\nis certainly true for supersymmetric models, but also for extended Higgs sectors, little-Higgs\nmodels or models with large or warped extra dimensions.\nIndependent of the underlying model, FCNC processes involving down-type quarks are\nhighly suppressed in the Standard Model and therefore sensitive to modifications involving\nfor example the top-quark sector. Beyond their loop suppression, the unitarity and hierarchical structure of the CKM matrix and the hierarchy mt,W \u001d mu,c ensure GIM cancellations\nbetween the light-flavor loop contributions, as experimentally required for example by the\nstrong kaon sector constraints. Turning this argument around, FCNCs have for a long time\nbeen sensitive probes of new physics which might or might not respect these symmetries and\nare a stringent constraint on many models. In supersymmetric models they provide a handle\non the stop and chargino masses, in particular when the supersymmetric flavor structure is\n(close to) minimally flavor-violating [648].\nComputing the decay widths Bs,d \u2192 `+ `\u2212 we observe the steepest tan \u03b2 dependence of\nany known observable [649, 650]:\nA(Bq \u2192 `+ `\u2212 ) \u221d\n\nyb y`\ncos \u03b2 m2A\n\ntan \u03b2\u001d1\n\n\u221d\n\nmb m` tan3 \u03b2\n.\nm2A\n\n(137)\n\nThis dependence makes it a prime suspect to extract tan \u03b2 from [651].\nThe good news for B physics observables is that most studies of cascade decays include\nthe bottom sector. The reason is that sbottoms decay to bottom jets, which can be tagged\nand are less likely to be confused with the overwhelming QCD radiation accompanying heavy\nparticles at the LHC [215, 476, 477]. A technical problem is that for tan \u03b2 values below 10\nor 15 we are unlikely to observe any of the heavy Higgs bosons and fix their mass scales.\nFor that reason we modify the usual parameter point and consider tan \u03b2 = 30, 40, where we\ncan assume mA to be measured.\n142\n\n\ftan \u03b2\n\n30\n\n40\n\nvalue\nerror\nvalue\nerror\nmh\n112.6\n4.0\n112.6\n4.0\nmt\n174.5\n2.0\n174.5\n2.0\nmH \u00b1\n354.2\n10.0\n307.2\n10.0\nm\u03c701\n98.4\n4.8\n98.7\n4.8\nm\u03c702\n183.1\n4.7\n183.5\n4.7\nm\u03c703\n353.0\n5.1\n350.7\n5.1\nm\u03c7\u00b1\n182.8\n50.0\n183.1\n50.0\n1\nmg\u0303\n607.7\n8.0\n607.6\n8.0\nmtb\n404.2 \u221a 5.0\n404.2 \u221a 5.0\nBR(Bs \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc) 7.3 *10\u22129 N \u2297 15% 3.2*10\u22128 N \u2297 15%\nTABLE XI: Set of toy measurements.

For a first study we assume the\nobservables listed in Table XI. The three neutralino masses gives us indirect information\non the chargino mass parameters M2 and \u03bc, and the left-handed stop mass is linked to the\nleft-handed sbottom mass via SU (2). The new measurements we include are BR(Bs \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc)\nand the edge of mtb [632]. For Bs \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc, LHCb alone expects about 100 events at the\nStandard Model rate after 5 years of running. For our study we assume an integrated\nluminosity of 10 fb\u22121 for the Bs sample. The Higgs-mediated contribution always increases\nthe corresponding events number.\nInstead of defining observables in which QCD effects cancel, we test the possibility of\nusing the actual Bs branching ratio. In that case, the theory error from the QCD prediction\nof the decay constant fBs becomes a serious issue. Because the Higgs exchange always\nincreases the decay rate Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 , the statistical experimental error on the decay width\nranges around 10%. As a consequence, the theory error, which at present is around 30%, will\nsoon dominate the total uncertainty, unless it can be reduced. This might be expected from\nlattice QCD (see Ref. [652] for a recent review). For our study we optimistically assume a\nreduction of the error on fBs to 7%, about half its present value and commonly believed to\nbe realistic over the next five years.\nIn Table XII we see that, without taking into account the theory error, tan \u03b2 will be determined to roughly 10% from the combined toy data sample. Including a realistic theory error\nincreases this number to 15\u201320%. The errors on the remaining parameters remain largely\nunchanged.

Dimensionful quantities are in units of GeV. For the measurement of BR(Bs \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc)\nwe assume either no theory error or an expected improvement to 15%, as compared to the current\nstatus. Table taken from Ref. [647]\n\nof the error bars, and the central fit value for the top mass is consistently lower than the\ninput value (by roughly half a standard deviation). Comparing our error estimates with the\nresults from Section IV A 3, we expect the situation to improve for all model parameters\nonce we include a more extensive set of measurements and properly correlated errors.\nThe detailed results of this study should not be used at face value. First of all, it is not\nclear if such a stop mass measurement can be achieved in the SPS1 parameters point or with\nan increased value of tan \u03b2. Secondly, for the heavy/charged Higgs mass we only use a toy\nmeasurement. And last but not least, we do not (yet) take into account error correlations\nat this stage. None of these omissions we expect to move the result of a complete analysis\ninto a definite direction, but there is certainly room for the final error bars to move.\nThis result shows, however, that the parameter tan \u03b2 can indeed be extracted from a\ncombined cascade and flavor data sample. Moreover, it shows that the combination of\ncascade-decay and flavor observables will crucially depend on the quality of QCD predictions\nin all sectors. Even our rough analysis shows that electroweak and sometimes even QCD\nfixed-order corrections are not the primary issues in these analyses. However, following the\nlast two sections, the extraction of tan \u03b2 might turn into the most fascinating jigsaw in the\nLHC era.\nD.\n\nCombination with dark matter\n\nBefore we combine collider data with dark matter observations we have to start with an\nassumption concerning the nature of the dark matter candidate. We need to assume that\nthe apparently stable particle which carries away energy in the LHC experiments is in fact\nthe dark matter which fills the Universe [43]. This means that we extrapolate from stable\nparticles at the LHC and lifetimes of O(100 ns) to a lifetime of order the age of the universe.\nOn the other hand, there are many models where the lightest weakly interacting particle\nmarks the end of cascade decays at colliders, but subsequently decays into the actual source\nof cosmological dark matter [653]. Given the range of such very weak couplings, the lifetime\n144\n\n\fof the apparent dark matter agent produced in ATLAS or CMS can have an enormous range\nof values.\nIf we indeed observe a dark matter candidate at the LHC, the primary cosmological\nmeasurement is the relic density \u03a9DM h2 = 0.1131 \u00b1 0.0034. To apply this as a constraint\non the BSM physics, we must assume the dark matter was produced by thermal freeze-out,\nand that the cosmological evolution during and after freeze-out was of the standard form.\nNeither of these assumptions are obviously correct, and the comparison with the relic density\nmay turn out to be a more of a probe of cosmology at temperatures of order \u223c 10 GeV\nthan a constraint on the parameters of a particle physics model. In the case of a standard\nthermal relic, the density of dark matter is controlled by pair annihilation of dark matter\ninto SM particles or co-annihilation with an almost mass degenerate second-lightest new\nparticle [43, 654]. In the latter case the two lowest masses should agree to within a few\npercent.\nThe link between dark matter and other TeV-scale observations is hazy, and detailed\nmodels may seem to indicate correlations which are not representative. A good example\nis the common lore of a strong link between dark matter, flavor observables and Tevatron\nsignals for supersymmetric dark matter: dark matter annihilation is most effective in the\npresence of an s-channel (light) scalar or (heavy) pseudo-scalar Higgs. This s-channel state\nneeds to be on-shell, so the annihilation strongly correlates Higgs masses with the LSP mass.\nFlavor physics, as discussed in Section IV C, is sensitive to the pseudoscalar Higgs mass and\nthe stop mass. Last but not least, Tevatron searches for tri-leptons rely heavily on one\nslepton sitting between the second-lightest and the lightest neutralino in mass. Unfortunately, the scalar masses of Higgs bosons, squarks and sleptons are related by the unknown\nSUSY breaking mechanism. In a TeV-scale analysis of supersymmetry these three sets of\nobservables could not be less correlated. The lesson to be learned is that when combining\nvery distinct experiments we have to be even more careful what model we really test [655].\nMore generally, this example shows that when we consider weakly-interacting dark matter\nthe relevant cosmological observables cannot be computed from the properties of the dark\nmatter agent alone. Assuming a light neutralino LSP in the mass range around O(500) GeV\nthere are four main scenarios which determine what kind of measurements we need to link\nLHC measurements with cosmological measurements [656]. They can be organized by the\ndark-matter annihilation process which predicts the relic density after thermal production\nand freeze-out. First, the annihilation of dark matter can be dominated by fermionic final\nstates, where in supersymmetry the annihilation process is t-channel sfermion exchange.\nThese channels will be dominated by the lightest t-channel particle, which could for example\nbe the lightest stau - based on the experimental observation that sleptons can be lighter\nthan squarks and that for sizeable tan \u03b2 the lightest stau can turn into the lightest slepton\nmass eigenstate. For this bulk region of the dark-matter parameter space the electroweak\nneutralino-slepton-lepton couplings are crucial. In Ref. [656] the parameter point LCC1 is\nan example for such a scenario, in many ways similar to the SPS1a parameter point [119].\nThe updated SPS1a0 improves the prediction of the relic density by shifting into the stau\ncoannihilation region. Secondly, the weakly interacting dark matter agent can decay into\npairs of W bosons, which is typical for Kaluza-Klein partners and for supersymmetric binowino mixed states (LCC2). For such a scenario we do not require any detailed knowledge of\nthe new-physics spectrum, because the s-channel and t-channel annihilation processes are\ndescribed by the dark-matter sector alone. A third channel for dark-matter annihilation is\n145\n\n\fco-annihilation with the second-lightest particle which has the same new-physics parity at\nthe LHC. This particle has to be within O(10%) of the LSP mass and can have electroweak\nas well as strong couplings. Typically, it will not be strongly interacting, because most\nof the candidates have strict mass limits from the Tevatron which make the mechanism\nharder to realize in a given model. However, in supersymmetry the co-annihilation partner\ncan for example be a stop, a stau or a chargino. And last, but not least, LSP pairs can\nannihilate through an effective 2 \u2192 1 process, where this on-shell state has a StandardModel dark matter parity. A good candidate is a Higgs scalar, since heavy Higgs scalars\nhave large widths which we can use to adjust the size of the annihilation rate. For such a\nrapid annihilation through a Higgs boson we have to understand the couplings of the LSP\nto a non-minimal Higgs sector. Since new physics at the TeV-scale typically does not obtain\nmasses through the weak Higgs mechanism, this can be hard. Moreover, understanding\nthe last two scenarios requires us to carefully study not one but two new states, the LSP\nand its annihilation partner or the funnel state. Unless the co-annihilation partner is a\nstrongly interacting stop, such a requirement makes the LHC task of predicting the weakly\ninteracting dark matter observables at least twice as hard.\nIn the spirit of proper bottom-up parameter extraction we start from the TeV-scale\nsupersymmetric Lagrangian. For any meaningful statement we also ensure that the particle\nleaving the LHC detectors unseen is indeed the dark matter agent. And finally, we assume\nthat it is weakly interacting. The first observable we reconstruct from LHC data and compare\nwith cosmological experiments is the neutralino relic density \u03a9DM h2 in the SPS1a parameter\npoint [484].\nProblems with tan \u03b2 measurements were discussed in sections IV B and IV C. The study\npresented in Ref.[484] keeps it fixed and conservatively treats the variation of the relic\ndensity prediction with tan \u03b2 as a systematic uncertainty. For simplicity we also assume\n\u03bc > 0 and that the heavier neutralino is indeed the \u03c7\u030304 . From Section IV A 3 we know that\nthese assumptions can be tested. Assuming the MSSM structure of the neutralino/chargino\nmass matrices we can now extract the LSP's gaugino and higgsino fractions. If the higgsino\nfraction is small we know that the relic density will be determined by annihilation via the\nlightest t-channel slepton, the light stau. To double check we can make sure that the Higgs\nmasses are not in the Higgs-funnel region mA \u223c 2m\u03c7\u030301 .\nTo compute the dark matter annihilation cross section we need to know all three entries\nof the stau mass matrix. The stau mixing angle fixes the coupling strength to the lightest\nneutralino. One way of avoiding nasty QCD errors is adding a ratio of measurements, for\nexample a ratio of branching ratios BR(\u03c7\u030302 \u2192 ` \u0303R `)/BR(\u03c7\u030302 \u2192 \u03c4\u03031 \u03c4 ) with a 10% error [567].\nAside from tan \u03b2 this ratio depends on the incoming and outgoing particle masses and on the\nstau mixing angle which we can measure with an uncertainty of roughly 35%. Now, we can\npredict the neutralino relic density for fixed values of tan \u03b2, mA and m\u03c4\u03032 with an error around\n20%, dominated by a conservative 5 GeV error bar of the m\u03c4 \u03c4 edge in Table V. Varying the\nthree input parameters within the experimental constraints gives us an additional cumulative\nuncertainty of (+2%, \u221212%). The study of less favorable model points shows, however, that\nin general additional information from a linear collider is needed to discriminate different\nMSSM parameter points giving very different predictions for the dark matter relic density.\nGoing one step beyond this simple relic density estimate, we can also predict the direct\nand indirect detection cross sections. This combination has been successfully applied to\nan alternative supersymmetric dark matter candidate, the sneutrino: a sneutrino-neutrino146\n\n\fFIG. 53: Dark matter density predictions for the parameter points SPS1a' (left) and LCC2 (right).\nFor SPS1a' we show the LHC results with a 5 GeV error on the neutralino\u2013stau mass difference\nand with a 5 GeV and 1 GeV error on m\u03c4 \u03c4 [658]. For LCC2 we assume LHC and LC measurements\nfollowing Ref. [659]. Figure taken from Ref. [656]\n\ngaugino coupling strength large enough to explain the measured relic density means that a\nsneutrino should have been observed in direct detection experiments [118]. Since this was\nnot the case we can limit our analyses to neutralino LSPs or non-standard sneutrinos [657].\nTechnically, the best suited approach for the prediction of dark matter properties is a\nMarkov chain. As a matter of fact, such a prediction is much closer to the original purpose\nof such Markov chains than a simple likelihood map over parameter space; first, we use some\nkind of measure like the likelihood given LHC mass measurements. Then, we compute a\nset of observables for these parameter points and extract a probability distribution for these\nobservables. Two predictions of the relic density in the parameter points SPS1a' and LCC2\nwe show in Fig. 53. Obviously, the results we can hope for at the LHC are considerably less\nprecise than a later linear collider analysis, which can be easily understood from Section IV E.\nMoreover, since in SPS1a' the co-annihilation helps us achieve the measured relic density,\nits results are critically dependent on the stau mass measurement and the mass difference\nbetween the NLSP-stau and the LSP. Note that the m\u03c4 \u03c4 edge is a function of the mass\nsquared difference of these two states, so it has an increased sensitivity on the stau\u2013neutralino\nmass difference. From the distribution we see that the tolerance of the measured relic density\non this mass difference is considerably smaller than the LHC error, even with an optimistic\n1 GeV error on the edge position. For LCC2 we see two peaks in the relic density probability:\none for a bino-like LSP at the correct value, and another one for either a wino or a higgsino\nsolution to the LHC measurements. Such states annihilate much more efficiently and predict\na much smaller relic density.\nAs another example for predicting observables based on LHC (and LC) data we show the\ndistributions of spin-independent neutralino\u2013proton and neutralino\u2013neutron cross sections\nin Fig. 54. In LCC1 the problem is that the main channel for neutralino\u2013proton scattering\nis the t-channel exchange of a heavy Higgs boson. Heavy Higgs bosons, however, are only\nobservable for large values of tan \u03b2, considerably larger than the tan \u03b2 = 10 of LCC1, LCC2\nand SPS1a. The peak at small cross sections observed in the upper left panel of Fig. 54\ncorresponds to a light Higgs in the t-channel. This poor result only changes, if for example\nat a high-energy linear collider we observe the heavy Higgs states. For the LCC2 case the\n147\n\n\fFIG. 54: Expected spin-independent neutralino\u2013proton cross sections. We show results for LCC1\nand LCC2. Figure taken from Ref. [656]\n\nt-channel exchange of a light Higgs gives the correct peak of the neutralino-proton cross\nsection, with additional peaks at larger values.\nSuch an analysis is by no means limited to supersymmetry and can be extended to other\ndark matter models, such as UED. In the 5d UED case, the annihilation it usually predominantly into charged leptons, and once again coannihilation, e.g. with KK leptons may\nbe important [277]. In that case, precise measurements of the mass difference between the\nLKP and the NLKP are crucial. The fact that the LKP in such theories is a massive vector,\nwithout spin-suppressed interactions favors larger masses than is typical for a neutralino,\nwhich itself makes the 5d UED theory with a thermal relic harder to reconstruct at the\nLHC, because the rates are correspondingly smaller.\nE.\n\nCombination with a linear collider\n\nAs should be apparent from the discussion in this section, a future linear collider would\nbe the perfect experiment to complement LHC and other measurements, because the main\nchallenge at the LHC is the precision on the weakly interacting sector of new physics. The one\nalternative to a linear collider would be replacing precise measurements by as precise biases,\nlike for example postulating supersymmetric GUT models to extract the neutralino/chargino\nsector parameters from the gluino mass or the squark masses. Therefore, we need to study\nhow well the LC and the LHC can be combined to extract the strongly interacting sector of\nnew physics as well as the weakly interacting sector.\nAs usual, we have to rely on MSSM analyses, starting from the only complete set of\nexperimental studies available [617, 618]. In Table IV we already list the precision of LC\nmass measurements. The best of these measurements come from threshold scans, where it is\nnot clear for how many new particles such scans can be performed. In principle, we can use\nthis method for all new particles as long as they have an electroweak charge, i.e. all MSSM\nstates apart from the gluino. This method characterizes the kind of linear collider which we\nassume in this section; it needs enough energy to pair-produce all new weakly interacting\n\n148\n\n\fLHC\ntan \u03b2 10.0\u00b1\n4.5\nM1\n102.1\u00b1\n7.8\nM2\n193.3\u00b1\n7.8\nM3\n577.2\u00b1 14.5\nM\u03c4\u0303L 227.8\u00b1O(103 )\nM\u03c4\u0303R 164.1\u00b1O(103 )\nM\u03bc\u0303L 193.2\u00b1\n8.8\nM\u03bc\u0303R 135.0\u00b1\n8.3\nM\u1ebdL 193.3\u00b1\n8.8\nM\u1ebdR 135.0\u00b1\n8.3\nMq\u03033L 481.4\u00b1 22.0\nMt\u0303R 415.8\u00b1O(102 )\nMb\u0303R 501.7\u00b1 17.9\nMq\u0303L 524.6\u00b1 14.5\nMq\u0303R 507.3\u00b1 17.5\nA\u03c4\nfixed 0\nAt\n-509.1\u00b1 86.7\nAb\nfixed 0\nAl1,2\nfixed 0\nAu1,2\nfixed 0\nAd1,2\nfixed 0\nmA\n406.3\u00b1O(103 )\n\u03bc\n350.5\u00b1 14.5\nmt\n171.4\u00b1\n1.0\n\nLC\n12.1\u00b1\n7.0\n103.3\u00b1\n1.1\n194.1\u00b1\n3.3\nfixed 500\n190.7\u00b1\n9.1\n136.1\u00b1\n10.3\n194.5\u00b1\n1.3\n135.9\u00b1\n0.87\n194.4\u00b1\n0.91\n135.8\u00b1\n0.82\n499.4\u00b1 O(102 )\n434.7\u00b1O(4 * 102 )\nfixed 500\nfixed 500\nfixed 500\n613.4\u00b1 O(104 )\n-524.1\u00b1 O(103 )\nfixed 0\nfixed 0\nfixed 0\nfixed 0\n393.8\u00b1\n1.6\n354.8\u00b1\n3.1\n171.4\u00b1\n0.12\n\nLHC+LC\n12.6\u00b1\n6.2\n103.2\u00b1 0.95\n193.3\u00b1\n2.6\n581.0\u00b1 15.1\n190.3\u00b1\n9.8\n136.5\u00b1 11.1\n194.5\u00b1\n1.2\n136.0\u00b1 0.79\n194.4\u00b1 0.84\n135.9\u00b1 0.73\n493.1\u00b1 23.2\n412.7\u00b1 63.2\n502.4\u00b1 23.8\n526.1\u00b1\n7.2\n509.0\u00b1 19.2\n764.7\u00b1O(104 )\n-493.1\u00b1 262.9\n199.6\u00b1O(104 )\nfixed 0\nfixed 0\nfixed 0\n393.7\u00b1\n1.6\n354.7\u00b1\n3.0\n171.4\u00b1 0.12\n\nSPS1a\n10.0\n103.1\n192.9\n577.9\n193.6\n133.4\n194.4\n135.8\n194.4\n135.8\n480.8\n408.3\n502.9\n526.6\n508.1\n-249.4\n-490.9\n-763.4\n-251.1\n-657.2\n-821.8\n394.9\n353.7\n171.4\n\nTABLE XIII: Result for the general MSSM parameter determination.

These threshold scans can be combined with the kinematic endpoints listed in Table V.\nFor the best-fit parameter point in Section IV A 3 we show the resulting errors in Table XIII.\nThe general feature is that the LHC is not sensitive to several of the TeV-scale model\nparameters, as is the linear collider alone. The strength of the LHC is clearly visible in\nthe sector of heavy new particles with color charge. Whenever a parameter is accessible at\nboth colliders the linear collider dominates the precision. For example in the slepton and\nneutralino/chargino sectors, the LC improves the precision by an order of magnitude. While\nat the LHC and LC separately not all parameters can be determined, the combination of\nthe two machines will allow us to measure essentially all parameters, with the exception of\nthe first and second generation trilinear couplings. Given a sufficient linear collider energy\nthis statement is fairly general - strongly interacting particles are hard to hide at the LHC,\nat least as long as they decay to anything but light-flavor jets. Weakly interacting particles\nwill be pair-produced and measured at a linear collider.\n149\n\n\f\u03c72 / ndf\n\n160\n\n27.6 / 17\n\nProb\n\n0.04987\n116.4\u00b1 4.9\n\nConstant\n\n140\n\nMean\nSigma\n\n120\n\n9.991\u00b1 0.004\n0.1121\u00b1 0.0029\n\n140\nEntries\n\nEntries\n\n160\n\n\u03c72 / ndf\n78.53 / 17\nProb\n6.993e\u221210\nConstant 127.6\u00b1 6.6\nMean\n\u22124961\u00b1 41.2\nSigma\n1033\u00b1 39.9\n\n100\n\n80\n60\n\n80\n60\n\n40\n\n40\n\n20\n0 9.6\n\n180\n\n120\n\n100\n\nM3\nMArun\nmt\n\nParameter\n\nMStL\nM1\nM2\n\nMSbR\nMStR\nMSuL\n\nXt\nXb\nMSuR\n\nMStauR\nMSeL\nMStauL\n\nMu\nXtau\nMSeR\n\ntanBeta\n\nRelative uncertainties and bias\n\nSPS1a' scenario\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n-0\n-0.1\n-0.2\nno theo.unc.\n-0.3 with theo. unc.\n-0.4\n\n20\n9.8\n\n10\ntan \u03b2\n\n10.2\n\n10.4\n\n0\n\n\u22128000 \u22126000 \u22124000 \u22122000\nXb (GeV)\n\n0\n\nFIG. 55: MSSM fit to combined LHC and LC data in the parameter point SPS1a'. The left panel\nshows the precision neglecting and including the theory error. The two right panels show the\ndistributions of 1000 toy experiments smeared according to the measurement errors. Figure taken\nfrom Ref. [618]\n\nIt is instructive to compare the effect of theory errors on the parameter determination.\nWhile the LC loses a factor five in precision, going from a per-mille determination to half a\npercent, the LHC loses less than a factor two. As discussed in Section IV A 3 the latter is due\nto the one best-measured LHC observable, the triangular m`` edge. For some parameters\nthe light supersymmetric Higgs mass and its theory error seriously affect the LHC results.\nIn that case we need to keep in mind that for the calculation of the Higgs masses we not\nonly have to believe the perturbative error estimate but also the minimal structure of the\nsupersymmetric Higgs sector.\nA similar Fittino analysis of the MSSM parameter space adds all production cross sections\ntimes (observable) branching ratios to the linear collider data set. In the clean and QCD-free\nenvironment we can compute cross sections with a reasonable theory error and ensure that\nwe see all of the dominant decay channels. On the other hand, this analysis assumes gaussian\ntheory errors, which makes it hard to compare the results. In Fig. 55 we show the resulting\nerrors on some of the MSSM model parameters from a combined LHC-LC fit including\nLC production rates. Again, we see that neglecting theory errors will underestimate the\nerrors on the model parameters by typically a factor two. The best way of estimating\nthe one-dimensional error bars of each model parameter is a numerical error propagation:\nrunning fits to 1000 smeared toy measurements and measuring the widths of the resulting\ndistributions. In Fig. 55 we see the results for the infamous tan \u03b2 and Xb = (Ab \u2212 \u03bc tan \u03b2).\nWhile the extraction of tan \u03b2 rests on the assumption of a minimal Higgs sector and the\ncorresponding neutralino and chargino mixing matrices, the linear collider has the potential\nof measuring this parameter with an error of a few percent. The sbottom mixing angle, or\nXb , also shows a clear peak in the likelihood, but with an error around a TeV. Note that\nthis result does not mean it will be impossible to measure some model parameters, we might\njust be missing the one good idea to do it.\nThere are some parameters which we have not yet discussed yet - strictly speaking we\nassume a minimal Higgs sector and a common supersymmetric mass scale when we construct\nthe off-diagonal entries in the neutralino and chargino mass matrices. The bino-wino mixing\nterms are the Yukawa couplings of the mass eigenstates. Their parameterization in terms of\nmW,Z and tan \u03b2 will change through renormalization group effects for example when we allow\n150\n\n\ffor several stages of supersymmetry breaking. By studying all neutralinos and charginos,\nsuch effects can be extracted at a linear collider [113, 647, 661]. Similarly, CP-violating\nphases can alter the structure of the neutralino and chargino mixing matrices. While all\nphases relevant to neutralinos and charginos are strongly constrained by the combination of\nelectron, proton and mercury electric dipole moments and even the linear collider has little\nhope to tell us more [110], a large phase of At might be visible as an inconsistency in the fit\nto the minimal supersymmetric Higgs sector [662]. These caveats reflect the basic feature\nthat the tested hypothesis determines the appropriate observables as well as the (theory)\nerrors, which needs to be checked at every stage of this analysis.\nIn this section we have see that if we properly take into account all theory errors in the\ncombined analysis of TeV-scale models in the LHC era we should be able to make definitive\nstatements about their underling structure. If we do manage to control all potential pitfalls,\nthe combination of LHC and LC measurements and the links to dedicated experiments like\n(g \u2212 2)\u03bc , flavor physics or dark matter observables [620, 621, 656, 663] can pave a way to\ndetermining the nature of TeV-scale physics over the coming years.\n\n151\n\n\fV.\n\nOUTLOOK\n\nOf course, writing a review on new physics specifically for the LHC at this point in time\nmeans that in the best of all worlds only one of the models described in Section II - and\nhence a very small fraction of this document - will be known to be correct a few years from\nnow. As a matter of fact, there is a fair chance that none of the models described in this\nreview will turn out to describe the TeV scale. To put it bluntly, this review might turn out\nto be two hundred pages of 'wrong physics'. So why write or read it?\nWell, it is very likely that at least some of the signatures analyzed in Section III will actually be seen at the LHC. The LHC is too complicated a machine and QCD too complicated\na theory for us to expect new physics effects to appear and be understood automatically.\nNew physics at the LHC is something we have to go and search for, and searching requires\ninspiration and guidelines. This was our primary goal. Reading this review, it should be\nobvious that it would have been impossible to write the signatures section without having\nwritten the models section, and this is even more true for the section on deducing the underlying UV completion of the Standard Model. At the end of the LHC era, it is precisely\nin these latter stages of analysis that we hope to be.\nIn this sense, even if ten years from now we will be forced to sit down and write a new\nSection II and heavily modify Section III, we hope that at least some readers will find that\nthe first edition of this review on new physics at the LHC came at exactly at the right time,\nand helped them to dig out the new and improved standard model of physics at the TeV\nscale.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe are grateful to (in alphabetical order) Uli Baur, Ed Berger, Thomas Binoth, Kyle\nCranmer, Sally Dawson, Tao Han, Gordy Kane, Mihoko Nojiri, Aaron Pierce, Giacomo\nPolesello, Dave Rainwater, Carlos Wagner, James Wells, C.\u2013P.
