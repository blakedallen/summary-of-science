For example, SER describes equally well stress experiments on\namorphous Se, centered on 103 s, as well as spin-polarized\nneutron scattering experiments, centered on 10\u22129 s, both\nwith the same value of \u03b2, over a time range of more than\n1012 . SER also describes accurately stress relaxation\nof the superconducting transition temperatures in the\ncuprates, probably associated with the two-gap domain\nstructure revealed by high resolution scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy [2]; moreover, the measured value of \u03b2 is the\npredicted value, 3/5, for YBCO, by far the most extensively studied cuprate, with the highest quality samples.\nThe agreement is such that it has been recently proposed\nthat the SER be used as an independent measure of sample quality in these materials [3]. Phillips' review [1] gives\nmany more examples and demonstrates the power of SER\nas a guide to understanding the dynamical properties of\nintrinsic glasses, especially network glasses. One of the\nmost spectacular examples was the successful prediction\n[4] of the long- and short-preparation-time values of \u03b2 of\northoterphenyl (OTP), as measured by multidimensional\nNMR. OTP is the purest organic glass former available\ncommercially; the predicted values were 0.43 and 0.60,\nand the observed values were 0.42 and 0.59.\nIt appears that SER may arise as a result of spatial\ninhomogeneities that are quenched into macroscopically\npure, non-phase separated glasses on a microscopic scale\nas traps or sinks that appear as part of the glass-forming\nprocess. The existence of these inhomogeneities is difficult to detect experimentally, but they readily account\nfor SER, and predict correctly the values of beta in many\nexperiments [1]. Dynamical heterogeneities have been\nseen experimentally and numerically in glasses and supercooled liquids [5, 6], spin-glass models [7, 8], LennardJones alloy mixtures with ellipsoidal probes [9] as well as\nin coupled-chaotic systems such as diode-resonator arrays [10]. In particular, the concept of dynamical het-\n\nerogeneities has emerged as critical for the description of\nthe microscopic dynamics associated with the dramatic\nslowing down of the relaxation and diffusion processes\nas the temperature approaches Tg , the glass-transition\ntemperature [11, 12, 13].\nThese spatial heterogeneities occur over time scales\nthat are long with respect to the basic unit time of the\nsystems - one step in coupled maps and a lattice vibration in supercooled liquids - but shorter than the\nmacroscopic relaxation, where materials are known to be\nhomogeneous. As the temperature or the driving force\nis decreased, these regions become more and more stable\nand might overtake the whole sample at a transition temperature. Although the nature of spatial heterogeneities\nand their relation to the macroscopic dynamics remains\nincompletely understood, there is a considerable amount\nof work that relates directly to this issue. The modecoupling theory describes the dynamics from the liquid\nphase into the supercooled regime and makes quantitative predictions that have been verified numerically in\nmany systems [14, 15]. It cannot yet describe accurately the very long time behavior in the supercooled\nregime, however [14]. Numerically, dynamical heterogeneities have been studied using a wide range of criteria\ntied various aspects of this feature[5, 16, 17]. Recently,\nhowever, some groups have focused on the renewal or\nmean first-passage time (MFPT) [18] and the waitingtime distribution (WTD) which provide some link to the\nstructure of the energy landscape [19, 20].\nAlthough both the dynamical heterogeneities and the\nstretched exponential behavior are characteristics of\nmany frustrated systems (e.g. supercooled liquids [21]),\nit is not clear what the relation between these two properties is. In this paper, we address this question and show\nthat dynamical heterogeneities can be directly responsible for the observation of stretched exponential relaxation\nin coupled map lattices. We also show that these results\nare applicable to supercooled liquids and can provide a\nmicroscopic basis for the stretched exponential relaxation\nin these systems, in line with the observations of Denny et\nal. on the long time dynamics of meta-basin hopping [20].\n\n\f2\nRecently, Hunt et al. found that the distribution of the\nrenewal time of a certain stochastic process measured in a\none-dimensional lattice of coupled diode resonators could\nbe fitted to a stretched exponential function over 6 orders of magnitude [10]. Simulations on a related model\nof diffusively coupled via short range interactions nonlinear maps show that the fit can be extended to more\nthan 9 orders of magnitude, ruling out any other power\nlaw or simple combination of pure exponentials [10, 22].\nThe quality of the fit in this system is sufficient to distinguish the region of the parameter space where the dynamics is described by power-law distribution coupled\nwith an exponential cut-off from the really stretched exponential distributions. (Ref. [22] contains background\ninformation important for understanding the results of\nthe present work and will be referred to as [I] in the following.)\nThese simulations [I] also demonstrated the importance of the system's size on its dynamics. While\nstretched exponentials are sufficiently robust and are observed even in some small samples, the quality of such\nfits is much poorer than in the big samples. This is in\ndirect analogy with real experimental results and supports the observation that the quality of the samples is\ncrucial for obtaining unambiguous stretched exponential\nbehavior and meaningful values of the exponent \u03b2 [1, 3].\nUsing simulations on this and other models, as well\nas some analytical results, we show here that (1) the\nstochastic process studied in Refs. [10] and [I] can be\nidentified with a renewal process [23], (2) a stretched exponential distribution of the renewal time implies a similar shape for the decay of the two-point auto-correlation\nfunction, and (3) renewal processes are present in a supercooled liquid and play a central role in its dynamics.\nGranted the universal features of SER, readers unfamiliar with chaos theory and coupled maps may not see\nimmediately the relevance of these mathematical tools to\nunderstanding the dynamical properties of supercooled\nliquids and glasses. Even the successful predictions of the\ntrap (sink) model [1, 24] appear to be unexpected. For\ninstance, the survival probability of a random walker in\nthe presence of randomly distributed static traps crosses\nover from exponential to SER only at longer times where\nvery few (\u223c 10\u221230 for 10% traps) of the walkers have\nsurvived [25]. In our examples of steady-state dynamics\nin coupled maps, the analogous crossover in trap-time\ndistributions \u03c1(t) occurs near 10\u22121 to 10\u22122 \u00d7 max{\u03c1(t)}\ndepending on the value of a control parameter. Even\nthe latter number is small compared to the crossovers\nobserved, for example, for relaxation of the first peak in\nthe structure factor in molecular dynamics simulations\n(MDS) of crystallization-avoiding soft sphere mixtures\n[26], which occur near 3/4 of the maximum value. The\nreason for these differences is that the systems chosen\nfor MDS already represent prepared states with strong\nglass-forming tendencies. The random walker with random traps model contains spatial inhomogeneities, which\nwe will show represent an essential feature necessary for\n\nSER, and which are absent from some popular models of\nstatic glass structure such as mode-coupling theory [27].\nThat model does not contain the collapse of phase space\nthat occurs as the liquid is supercooled to the glass transition, and that is why SER appears only at very long\ntimes. However, it does contain the correct dimensional\ndependence of diffusive behaviour that leads to the relation \u03b2 = d/(d + 2), which is important for comparisons\nto experiment. That the one-dimensional coupled map\nlattice discussed here reaches a steady-state much more\nrapidly than the random walker is a clear indication that\nthis model is physically relevant. The way in which this\nhappens was illustrated in Fig. 8 of [I]: the surviving\nperiodic domains are those that have avoided chaotic regions.\nWe also emphasize that in this simple model, the behavior of the stretching exponent \u03b2 as a function of a\ncontrol parameter r is similar to the dependence of \u03b2 on\nthe temperature in both 3D [28] and 1D [8] spin-glass\nmodels. This similarity not only captures the qualitative\ntendency for \u03b2 to decrease with decreasing r (or T ), but\nalso the quantitative agreement in the low-r (or T ) limit\n\u03b2 \u2248 1/3. The same lowest value of \u03b2 was obtained in\nstudies of random walks on fractals [29, 30, 31].\nII.\nA.\n\nRESULTS\n\nProperties of the coupled map model\n\nThe nonlinear model of Ref. [10], used to reproduce qualitatively the experimental system, is a onedimensional chain of N diffusively coupled nonlinear deterministic maps, f (x), with a coupling constant \u03b1 and\nperiodic boundary conditions. The time evolution of this\nsystem is discrete and is described by the following iterative equation,\n\u03b1\nxn (t+1) = (1\u2212\u03b1)f (xn (t))+ {f (xn\u22121 (t)) + f (xn+1 (t))} .\n2\n(1)\nwhich, given initial conditions xn (0) for each site n =\n1, 2, . . . , N , generates a time series {xn (t)}. The interaction is totalistic and involves only the nearest neighbors. Following [I], in this study we use the logistic map\nf (x) = rx(1 \u2212 x).\nFollowing the analysis of the experimental data, the\nstochastic process of interest is represented by a coarsegrained variable defined as\n\u03c3n (t) = sgn[xn (t) \u2212 xthr ], t = 0, 2, 4, . . .\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the quantity xn (t) is defined in Eq. (1) and xthr\nis a certain threshold value. The basic dynamics of the\ncoupled oscillators being period two, the analysis is also\ndone over even (or odd) time steps.\nThis model shows a stretched exponential distribution\nof the renewal (or trap) times, which are defined in the\nnext section II B, over a wide range of the control parameter r, which plays a role akin to temperature as\n\n\f3\n\u03b2 to decrease with decreasing r (or T ), but also the quantitative agreement in the low-r (or T ) limit \u03b2 \u2248 1/3; the\nsame limit as that obtained in studies of random walks\non fractals [29, 30, 31].\nAlthough the bifurcation diagram for a site in the coupled map lattice (Fig. 1(d)) appears to be uniform with\nrespect to r down to r \u2248 3.8275, the non-monotonicity\nof \u03b20 (r) and \u03c40 (r) most probably arises from the fact\nthat for the isolated logistic map and the values of r < 4\nchaotic orbits are interspersed with period cascades seen\nin Fig. 1(c), i.e. the approach to full chaos as r goes to 4\nis not uniform. (For an explanation of the concept of bifurcation diagrams see e.g. Ref. [32].) Interestingly, the\nlowest value of \u03b20 is attained within the widest window\nof the period-three cascade in the bifurcation diagram of\nthe uncoupled logistic map. About and below r = 3.82,\nin the coupled map chain, very narrow chaotic windows\nare also interspersed with periodic ones and the stretched\nexponential behavior of the trap-time distribution, with\n\u03b20 greater or about 1/3, is recovered only for some values of r. This interesting behavior suggests that SER is\nuncovering a new aspect of the dynamics of coupled map\nlattices. A full analysis of this new behavior lies outside\nthe framework of this paper, but we plan to return to\nstudying it elsewhere.\nIn other models and experiments, the time scale \u03c4\nmonotonically grows with decreasing temperature. It is\nnot the case here, although the values of \u03c40 are greatest\nat the low-r (and low-\u03b20 ) end, following the general trend\nobserved elsewhere.\n\nB.\n\nFIG. 1: \u03b20 (a) and \u03c40 (b) as functions of the logistic map\nparameter r. Dots correspond to the least squares-fit values\nand the thin solid line is drawn as a guide to the eye. The\nvertical dashed lines demarcate the discontinuities in \u03b20 (r)\nand \u03c40 (r). They correspond very well to the positions of the\nperiodic cascades in the bifurcation diagram of the uncoupled\nlogistic map shown in (c). (d) shows the bifurcation diagram\nfor a site in the coupled map lattice. Inset in (b) magnifies\nthe right hand side of the main plot where the variation of\n\u03c40 with r is not distinguishable. The accuracy of \u03b20 and \u03c40\nobtained by a least-squares fit to the long time part of the\ntrap-time distribution is within 15%.\n\ncan be seen in Fig. 1. This figure shows the stretching exponent \u03b20 and the time scale \u03c40 as a function of\nthe control parameter r. The values of \u03b20 and \u03c40 were\nobtained by least-square fitting the long-time part of the\ntrap-time distributions for a chain of N = 10, 000 coupled logistic maps f (x) = rx(1 \u2212 x) with the expression A exp[\u2212(t/\u03c40 )\u03b20 ]. Although \u03b20 (r) and \u03c40 (r) are nonmonotonic, the overall behavior is similar to the results\nin both 3D [28] and 1D [8] spin-glass models. This broad\nsimilarity not only captures the qualitative tendency for\n\nRenewal processes in coupled maps\n\nThe stochastic process \u03c3n (t) is a renewal process [23]\nprovided that the time intervals (renewal times) between\ntwo subsequent zero crossings are statistically independent random variables. We tested the independence of\nthese time intervals for the present model, Eq. (2), by\ncalculating the distributions of the time intervals following time intervals of a specified length. The distributions\nwere identical regardless of the length of the preceding\ntime intervals.\nIn general, a renewal process is defined so that \u03c3(t) =\n+1 for t0 < t \u2264 t1 , \u03c3(t) = \u22121 for t1 < t \u2264 t2 , \u03c3(t) = +1\nfor t2 < t \u2264 t3 , and so on. The renewal processes are the\nsimplest possible stochastic processes readily susceptible\nof probability theoretical analysis [33]. The dynamics\nrepresented by such processes can be understood in terms\nof transition probabilities between the two possible states\n\u03c3 = \u00b11 [34].\nIn [I], it is shown that the existence of very long renewal\ntime intervals tn+1 \u2212 tn associated with the stretched exponential distribution can be attributed to the presence\nof time-limited ordered domains (or traps) with dominant spatial period of 4 sites.

In order to support these two affirmations, we first need to show that (1) there is a one to\none correspondence between renewal processes and their\ntime auto-correlation functions, because experimentally\nmeasurable relaxation responses are mathematically described by auto-correlation functions of certain dynamical variables and not directly by non-observable renewal\nprocesses, and that (2) the renewal processes are present\nin supercooled liquids and glasses and can be calculated\neffectively, exhibiting unambiguous stretched exponential\ndistributions of renewal time intervals.\n\nC(t) \u2261< \u03c3(t\u2032 )\u03c3(t\u2032 + t) >t\u2032\n\n(3)\n\nof a renewal process \u03c3(t) and the distribution \u03c1(t) of\ntime intervals tn+1 \u2212 tn between the zero crossings (or,\nin other words, renewals) of this process was recently\nstudied for a range of distributions [23]. Following this\napproach, Godr\u00e8che and Luck also showed [35] that C(t)\ncorresponding to the stretched exponential distribution\n\u03c1(t) =\n\n\u03b20\nexp[\u2212(t/\u03c40 )\u03b20 ]\n\u03c40 \u0393(\u03b20\u22121 )\n\n(4)\n\ncan also be represented by a stretched exponential at long\ntime\nC(t) \u2248 Cs.e.

[23], we know that the Laplace transform\nof the auto-correlation function is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2(1 \u2212 \u03c1\u0302(u))\n1\n1\u2212\n(6)\n\u0108eq (u) =\nu\nhtiu(1 + \u03c1\u0302(u))\nUsing the expression above for \u03c1\u0302(u), one finds, for the\nsingular part of the correlation function at equilibrium\n\u0108eq,sing (u) \u2248\n\n\u03c1\u0302sing (u)\nhtiu2\n\n(7)\n\nSince the behavior at large time is governed by its singular part, we get\n\u2032\u2032\nCeq\n(t) \u2248 \u03c1(t)/hti.\n\n(8)\n\nThis implies that for a stretched exponential \u03c1(t) in the\nasymptotic limit Ceq (t) \u221d \u03c1(t)[35].\nThe range of relevance for this analytical result can be\nconfirmed numerically by studying the statistical properties of a computer-generated sequence of (pseudo)random\nnumbers distribution according to the stretched exponential probability density function (pdf) Eq. (4).\nUsing the fundamental transformation law of probabilities [37], given a computer-generated sequence of\n(pseudo)random numbers {\u03b8} distributed uniformly in\nthe interval 0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 1, we apply a transformation rule\nt = \u03c40 [Q\u22121 (1/\u03b20 , \u03b8)]1/\u03b20 so that the resulting sequence\n{t} is distributed according to the stretched exponential\npdf \u03c1(t). In order to compute the inverse regularized\nincomplete gamma function Q\u22121 (a, \u03b8), we used the software from Refs. [38, 39].\nGiven a sequence of time intervals distributed according to a prescribed pdf, it is straightforward to construct\nthe corresponding renewal process and its autocorrelation\nfunction and second derivative. The second derivative is\ncalculated numerically, after applying a smoothing function before each derivative to improve the quality of the\noperation.\nThe resulting C \u2032\u2032 (t) and C(t), shown in Figs. 2 and\n3 respectively, demonstrate clearly that the correspondence between \u03c1(t) and C \u2032\u2032 (t) holds for long times for\nC(t) calculated both for the coupled map lattice model,\nEq. (1) with f (x) = rx(1 \u2212 x), r = 3.83, \u03b1 = 0.25\nand N = 1000, and for a renewal process where the renewal time-interval distribution is stretched exponential\nby prescription. C \u2032\u2032 (t) obtained numerically agrees with\n\u03c1(t)/hti, Eq. (8), without any free parameter within a\nmultiplicative factor of the order of unity.\nInterestingly, for the range measured, C(t) also follows\nthe stretched exponential form, albeit with somewhat\ndifferent parameters \u03c4c and \u03b2c . This indicates that the\ntrue asymptotic regime for C(t) or \u03c1(t) may be reached\nat longer time with a gradual approach towards this\nlong time behavior. This agrees with the theories (see\ne.g. [24]) where the stretched exponential functions are\n\naccompanied by time-dependent multiplicative factors.\nFor practical purposes, however, it is remarkable that\nthe stretched exponential fit to the correlation function\nagrees with C(t) starting with a well-observed experimentally value between 3/4 and 1/2 \u00d7 max{C(t)} and follows\nwith very high accuracy for several orders of magnitude\nto the regime beyond the reach of the experiments.\nC.\n\nMolecular dynamics\n\nHaving established the correspondence between the\ndistribution of time intervals of renewal processes and\ntheir auto-correlation functions, we now show that a renewal process can also be identified in a supercooled liquid and it appears to provide a simple and elegant description for the stretched exponential relaxation. In\norder to do so, we have performed molecular dynamics simulations of a 16000-particle single-component system where the interactions between the particles are\ndescribed by a pair potential labeled Z2 in Ref. [40].\nThis potential is similar to that introduced initially by\nDzugutov [41] but provides a longer-lived metastable supercooled state prior to crystallization. Otherwise the\nproperties of the Z2 liquid are similar to those of the\nDzugutov liquid, in particular it exhibits dynamical heterogeneities formed by short-lived clusters composed of\nconnected icosahedra [42]. The simulations are performed at T = 0.68, below the melting temperature of\nTm = 0.70 \u00b1 0.05 with a time step of 0.01 in reduced\nLennard-Jones units [43]. We take measurement over\nthe 16 000 atoms with the number density \u03c1 = 0.85 for\n7 million time steps, stopping before the system starts\ncrystallizing. This simulation time would correspond to\na 150-ns simulation for argon.\nA renewal process representing the atomic dynamics\nin the liquid can be constructed so that each renewal\ntime interval correspond to the time a particle spends in\na dynamical trap. This is identical to the first passage\ntime, in the parlance of Allegrini et al. [18], but differs\nformally from the waiting time of Doliwa and Heuer [19]\nand Denny et al. [20] which focuses on hops between energy basins. We say that particle i is trapped as long as\nits displacement\ndi (t) = |ri (t) \u2212 ri (0)|\n\n(9)\n\nmeasured starting from an arbitrary initial position ri (0)\nremains less than a certain threshold value dthr . The\nmoment t = tthr of surpassing the threshold is counted\nas a renewal and the value of ri (0) is reset to ri (tthr ) as\nwell as the time origin for the next trap.\nThe corresponding trap-time distribution (see Fig. 4)\nis not particularly sensitive to the choice of dthr as long\nas it is of the order of the effective atomic diameter. For\ndefinitiveness, we choose dthr = 2\u03c0/Q0 \u2248 0.88 [43], where\nQ0 is the position of the main peak in the static structure\nfactor S(Q) and neglect the temperature dependence of\nthis length scale. A threshold of \u2248 0.88 is about 4 times\n\n\f6\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n0\n\n10\n\n\u22125\n\nT=2.0\n\n10\n\u22121\n\n\u03c1(t)\n\n10\n\n0\n\u22122\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\n15\n\nT=0.68\n\n10\n\n10\n\n5\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n(t/\u03c40)\u03b20\n\n6\n\n8\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n\u03c1(t)\n\nlarger than the critical value estimated by Allegrini et al.\nin a binary Lennard-Jones system. While the focus of\nRef. [18] is on the inertial regime, which takes place as\nsmall distance, on the order of 0.1 atomic radius, we are\ninterested in the atomic displacement leading to a change\nin the configuration. Figure 4(a) also shows in inset that\nthe trap-time distribution is exponential at the temperature well above the melting point (Tm = 0.70 \u00b1 0.05)\nand its long-time tail well agrees with a stretched exponential fit with \u03b20 \u2248 0.71 in the supercooled regime. In\norder to be considered as a fully Markovian process, we\nalso assess the correlation between subsequent trapping\ntime intervals, as was done for the coupled map lattice.\nComparing trap distributions considering only the subset\nof events following traps of various length, again, we find\nno correlation between renewal time intervals. The value\nof \u03b20 agrees well with \u03b2 = 0.70 \u00b1 0.05 for the self part\nof the intermediate scattering function Fs (Q0 , t) calculated at the same temperature and for the same length\nscale. (For the definition of Fs (Q, t) see, e.g., Ref. [44].)\nFs (Q0 , t) for the Z2 liquid behaves similarly to the same\nquantity calculated for the supercooled Dzugutov liquid\n[45] and is not shown here.\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\nThese results appear at odds with the analysis of Allegrini et al. who report a power-law distribution for\nthe long-time tail of the renewal time [18], although admitting that the asymptotic cutoff in the distributions\nis difficult to resolve numerically. Fig. 4(b) shows our\nsimulation results at T = 0.68 plotted on a log-log scale\nwith a tentative fit of the long-time behavior. It is clear\nthat the stretched exponential provides a much better\nfit to the simulation data. This difference between the\ntwo simulations can be due to both a physical range of\nparameters and the precision of the simulation. First, Allegrini and collaborators focus on the inertial length-scale\nwhile the results presented here require atomic diffusion,\nnot only thermal vibrations; second, focusing on a single\ntemperature, our simulation uses a larger cell and averages over a time scale roughly 6 times longer.\n\nDenny et al. [20] also note that the distribution in\nRef. [18] may not be a power law. Although the waiting time distribution in Ref. [20] differs formally from\nthat is studied here, at long time they can be comparable since the escape of a particle from a sphere of radius\nof the order of the atomic diameter is likely to correspond\nto the transition of the phase point in the configuration\nspace between energy metabasins. We note however, that\nthe log-normal form of the waiting time distribution proposed by Denny et al. results in a correlation function\nthat can only be approximated with SER, whereas the\nstretched exponential first passage-time distribution results in a correlation function that is also stretched exponential at long time.\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\n(b)\n0\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\nt\n\nFIG. 4: (a) Dots: distributions of trap-time intervals for\nlow (T=0.68, each data point corresponds to an average\nover 500 time steps) and high temperatures (inset, T=2).\nDashed lines: corresponding stretched exponential fits with\n\u03c40 = 60 \u00b1 5, \u03b20 = 0.71 \u00b1 0.05 and (inset) \u03c40 = 1.22 \u00b1 0.05,\n\u03b20 = 1 \u00b1 0.002.

In direct analogy,\nit is natural to expect that the trap condition di (t) < dthr ,\nfor di (t) from Eq. (9), is satisfied as long as particle i is\nliterally trapped within a relatively stable environment\n- a \"cage\". Thus formed renewal process and the associated trap-time distribution and the autocorrelation\nfunction provide a simpler description of the structural\nrelaxation in a condensed matter system than, e.g., the\ncage correlation function [46] recently used to demonstrate the stretched exponential relaxation in a LennardJones massively defective crystal.\nIn particular, traps in the coupled map lattice show\nonly very short spatial extension that does not seem to\ndiverge as the overall dynamics of the system slows down.\n\n\f7\nAs \u03b20 goes from 0.6 > \u03b20 > 0.5 to 0.4 > \u03b20 > 0.3, the\nlonger traps go from about 120 to more than 30,000 time\nsteps but the characteristic time-averaged width of these\ntraps only quadruple, from 2 to 8 sites [I]. These observations are consistent with the behavior of dynamical\nheterogeneities observed in a number of model systems\n[7, 8, 16, 42].\nWe note that the only model that rigorously derives\nthe stretched exponential long time asymptotic behavior is that of a random walker in a system with static\ntraps (see e.g. Ref. [1]). Ref. [24] cites both upper [47]\nand lower [48] bounds for the asymptotic behavior of the\nsurvival probability. Both bounds have the same \u03b2, but\ndifferent \u03c4 . It is not obvious, however, that the above\ntheory directly applies to the results of this works. Nevertheless, our results are obtained in terms of first passage statistical distributions of the type encountered in\nthe static-trap model and the use of similar mathematical techniques may shed more light on the nature of the\ndynamics in the models presented here.\nIn conclusion, we focused on a relation between dynamical heterogeneities and stretched exponential relaxation\nin two models: a coupled chaotic oscillator system and\na supercooled liquid. Without insisting that the former\nmodel represents the actual behavior of real liquids, we\nhave shown that the asymptotic long time behavior of the\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n\nJ.
