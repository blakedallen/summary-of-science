Mitschang1 , Norbert S. Schulz2 , David P. Huenemoerder2 , Joy S. Nichols1 , Paola\nTesta1\n\nABSTRACT\nWe investigate X-ray emission properties of the peculiar X-ray source \u03b82 Ori A in the Orion\ntrapezium region using more than 500 ksec of HETGS spectral data in the quiescent state. The\namount of exposure provides tight constraints on several important diagnostics involving O, Ne,\nMg, and Si line flux ratios from He-like ion triplets, resonance line ratios of the H- and He-like lines\nand line widths. Accounting for the influence of the strong UV radiation field of the O9.7V star\nwe can now place the He-like line origin well within two stellar radii of the O-star's surface. The\nlines are resolved with average line widths of 341\u00b138 km s\u22121 confirming a line origin relatively\nclose to the stellar surface. In the framework of standard wind models this implies a rather\nweak, low opacity wind restricting wind shocks to temperatures not much larger than 2\u00d7106\nK. The emission measure distribution of the X-ray spectrum, as reported previously, includes\nvery high temperature components which are not easily explained in this framework. The X-ray\nproperties are also not consistent with coronal emissions from an unseen low-mass companion\nnor with typical signatures from colliding wind interactions. The properties are more consistent\nwith X-ray signatures observed in the massive Trapezium star \u03b81 Ori C which has recently been\nsuccessfully modeled with a magnetically confined wind model.\nSubject headings: stars: magnetic fields \u2013 stars: winds, outflows \u2013 X-rays: stars \u2013 stars: individual (\u03b82\nOri A)\n\n1.\n\nM\u2299 for each.\n\u03b82 Ori A has been extensively monitored in Xrays with The Chandra X-ray Observatory and\nhas shown its fair share of odd behavior. Observations in 2000 found that the X-ray source\nexhibited unusual and dramatic variability with\na 50% flux drop in less than 12 hours accompanied by multiple small flares with only a few\nhours durations (Feigelson et al. 2002). Such behavior in an early type stellar system is surprising since this can not be explained by the standard wind shock models for X-rays in early type\nstars (Lucy 1982; Owocki et al. 1988), nor by\nthe magnetically confined wind models (MCWMs;\nBabel & Montmerle (1997)). While the MCWM\ncan produce hard X-ray emission like observed in\n\u03b81 Ori C (Schulz et al. 2000, 2003; Gagn\u00e9 et al.\n2005) and \u03c4 Sco (Cohen et al. 2003)., it does not\nexplain the observed variability in \u03b82 Ori A. At\nthe time, the suggestion was made that such emis-\n\nIntroduction\n\n\u03b82 Ori A is a triple star system at the heart\nof the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), Its massive\nprimary has been identified as a 5th magnitude\nO9.5 V star (Abt et al. 1991) with a mass of 25\nM\u2299 (Preibisch et al. 1999), making it the second most massive star in the ONC next to the\n45 M\u2299 O5.5 V star of \u03b81 Ori C. A more recent photometric study provides an optical identification of O9 V and a total system mass of\n39\u00b114 M\u2299 (Sim\u00f3n-D\u0131\u0301az et al. 2006). The studies of Abt et al. (1991) and Preibisch et al. (1999)\nshow that this system includes two close intermediate mass companions at 174 AU and 0.47 AU\nseparation with mass estimates between 7 and 9\n1 Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO), Cambridge, MA\n2 MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, Cambridge, MA\n\n1\n\n\fsion could be the result of magnetic reconnection\nevents. To add to this excitement, a specifically\npowerful X-ray flare from \u03b82 Ori A, seen with the\nChandra High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS), surprised observers in 2004\n(Schulz et al. 2006) and produced a total power\noutput exceeding 1037 ergs s\u22121 . Considering the\norbital phase of the close spectroscopic companion, the low He-like forbidden/intercombination\nline ratios, and the fact that all lines remained\nunresolved led to the argument that these events\nare triggered by magnetic interactions with the\nclose companion. A sub-pixel re-analysis of a similar flare event which appeared during observations\nin the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP)\n(Stelzer et al. 2005; Schulz et al. 2006) in 2003,\nhowever, seem to indicate that these events may\noriginate from the companion instead (M. Gagne,\npriv. comm.). An unseen T Tauri companion appears unlikely due to the observed peculiar line\nproperties.\nIn contrast to that observed in the elevated\nstates, the quiescent spectrum of \u03b82 Ori A exhibits temperatures above 25 MK and has line ratios which suggest that the X-ray emitting plasma\nis close enough to the stellar surface of the massive star to argue for some form of magnetic confinement (Schulz et al. 2006). The argument is\nstrengthened by the fact that the line widths, quite\nin contrast to the narrow line widths observed during the outbursts, seem broadened to the order of\n300 km s\u22121 . These properties are very reminiscent of the MCWM results obtained in \u03b81 Ori C\n(Gagn\u00e9 et al. 2005), where, through detailed simulations, it was demonstrated that the bulk of the\nemitting plasma is close to the photosphere, or\nwithin \u223c2 R\u22c6 , and line widths are \u2264400 km s\u22121 .\nHowever, in spite of these apparent differences, the\nproperties of the quiescent state remained fairly\nunconstrained with respect to precise line ratios\nand widths. \u03b82 Ori A's X-ray luminosity is about\nan order of magnitude lower than than that observed during outburst and the study remained\nstatistically limited.\nThe Chandra Data Archive (CDA)1 now contains an additional \u223c 300 ks on \u03b82 Ori A between\n2004 and 2008 and in this paper we present a\nfull analysis of the quiescent spectrum allowing us\n\nto derive much better constrained line properties.\nThe results are also used to test the hypothesis\nthat the X-ray emission from \u03b82 Ori A is consistent with predictions from the MCWM. The paper is structured as follows; in Section 2 we discuss\nthe observations and analysis methods, in Section\n3 we discuss the results of our emission line measurements, and finally we summarize our findings\nin Section 4\n2.\n\nObservations and Analysis\n\nWe have retrieved Chandra HETGS data in\nthe vicinity of the ONC, which were originally\nobserved as a part of the HETG Orion Legacy\nProject (Schulz et al. 2008), from the CDA. There\nare now seventeen separate Chandra observations\nwhich include \u03b82 Ori A within an off-axis angle\nsuitable for extraction. See Table 1 for a list of\nthe included observations and selected properties.\nNoting that this study is focused on the quiescent\nstate spectrum and that ObsID 4474 was not included in any analysis in the current study due\nto the substantially elevated count rate during its\nentire exposure, we have accumulated 520 ks of\nexposure time on \u03b82 Ori A in the quiescent state.\nFigure 1 shows the total combined counts spectrum using the 520 ks on \u03b82 Ori A.\nAs noted, none of these observations were targeted at \u03b82 Ori A; indeed no Chandra gratings observations have ever targeted \u03b82 Ori A. However\nusing the suite of advanced extraction tools provided by the Chandra Transmissions Grating Catalog and Archive (TGCat; Huenemoerder et al.\n(2010); Mitschang et al. (2010))2 , extraction of\nthe dispersed counts of off-axis X-ray source positions proved to be trivial.\nGrating spectra were extracted and responses\ncomputed using TGCat software to locate the\noptimal centroid position of \u03b82 Ori A and apply proper calibration for each observation. In a\ncrowded field such as the Orion Trapezium, careful attention must be made during analysis to\ncontamination from other zeroth order counts lying close to or on top of dispersion counts and\ndispersion arms crossing one another at critical\npoints. To this end, we reviewed order sorting images (ACIS CCD event energy vs. gratings order\n2 http://tgcat.mit.edu\n\n1 http://cxc.harvard.edu/cda/\n\n2\n\n\f3\u00d710\u22123\n0\n\nCounts s\u22121 \u00c5\u22121\n10\u22123\n2\u00d710\u22123\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nWavelength (\u00c5)\n\nFig. 1.- Counts spectrum from the total combined data on \u03b82 Ori A (MEG+HEG).\nTable 1\nObservation Log\nSequence\nNumber\n200001\n200002\n200175\n200176\n200242\n200243\n200420\n200423\n200421\n200422\n200424\n200425\n200462\n200462\n200478\n200477\n200476\n\nObsID\n3\n4\n2567\n2568\n4473\n4474c\n7407\n7410\n7408\n7409\n7411\n7412\n8568\n8589\n8897\n8896\n8895\n\nStart Date\n(UT)\n\nStart Time\n(UT)\n\nExposure\n(ks)\n\nOffseta\narcmin\n\n1999-10-31\n1999-11-24\n2001-12-28\n2002-02-19\n2004-11-03\n2004-11-23\n2006-12-03\n2006-12-06\n2006-12-19\n2006-12-23\n2007-07-27\n2007-07-28\n2007-08-06\n2007-08-08\n2007-11-15\n2007-11-30\n2007-12-07\n\n05:58:56\n05:39:24\n12:25:56\n20:29:42\n01:48:04\n07:48:38\n19:07:48\n12:11:37\n14:17:30\n00:47:40\n20:41:22\n06:16:09\n06:54:08\n21:30:35\n10:03:16\n21:58:33\n03:14:07\n\n49.6\n30.9\n46.4\n46.3\n49.1\n50.8\n24.6\n13.1\n25.0\n27.1\n24.6\n25.2\n36.1\n50.7\n23.7\n22.7\n25.0\n\n2.42\n2.28\n1.98\n2.10\n1.26\n1.39\n1.64\n3.02\n2.08\n2.30\n3.94\n4.39\n2.53\n2.53\n3.37\n2.34\n1.74\n\nPhase Rangeb\n0.76-0.79\n0.92-0.99\n0.99-1.01\n0.53-0.55\n1.00-1.03\n0.96-0.99\n0.27-0.29\n0.40-0.41\n0.02-0.04\n0.19-0.21\n0.53-0.54\n0.55-0.56\n0.98-1.00\n0.10-0.13\n0.80-0.81\n0.54-0.55\n0.84-0.85\n\na 2\n\n\u03b8 Ori A zeroth order position offset from nominal pointing\n\nb\n\nAssuming a 20.974 day period and periastron passage at HJD\u25e6 =2440581.27 (Abt et al.\n1991)\nc\n\n4474 is included here only for reference, no analysis herein utilized it due to the extremely\nelevated count rate during its entirety\n\n3\n\n\f\u00d7 wavelength, or specifically FITS-file columns\nTG MLAM vs. ENERGY) for each observation\nand identified potential contamination.

It is easily seen from Eq. 1 that, ignoring\nphoto-excitation, Ro =R when n/nc \u226a 1 and thus\nrepresents the low density limit. We have computed Ro using emissivities in APED and temperatures derived from the G ratio given in Table\n3 for each f ir triplet and list them in Table 2. In\norder to test the MCWM predictions we derive\nthe radial distance (R/R\u22c6 ) using these f ir ratios,\na surface temperature of 30,000 K for the 09.7V\nstar and photo-excitation and decay rates from\nBlumenthal et al. (1972). Figure 4 shows the dependence curves with measured values and 90%\nconfidence intervals over-plotted.\nIn cases where there were significant contributions from other lines or line groups, as in the case\nof Ne IX f ir triplet where Fe XIX and Fe XXI converge and blend, those lines were included in the\nmodel. A special case is Ne X which is unresolvably blended with FeXVII. In this case we assumed\nthe Fe component contributed flux equaling 13%\nof the flux of a prominent FeXVII line at 15.01\u00c5\n(e.g. see Walborn et al. (2009)). Additionally, the\nMg Ly-series converges at the centroid position\nof the Si XIII f -line where we assumed, based on\nthe theoretical relative line strengths, the observed\nflux was overestimated by 10% of the measured\nflux of the isolated H-Like Mg XII Ly\u03b1 line.\nWhen fitting the He-like f ir triplet lines, the\nrelative separation of the lines was fixed and the\npositions of the resonance lines were constrained\nby their rest positions. Where available, we fit\n\nThe continuum emission of \u03b82 Ori A was modeled by fitting a single temperature APED model\nto the combined MEG+HEG counts for all observations to improve statistics. In order to fit\nonly the continuum emission, we selected a set of\nnarrow bands, considered free of significant line\nemission, specifically 2.00-2.95\u00c5, 4.4-4.6\u00c5, 5.36.0\u00c5, 7.5-7.8\u00c5, 12.5-12.7\u00c5 and 19.1-20 \u00c5 (e.g. see\nTesta et al. (2007)). We assumed a hydrogen column density (NH ) of 2 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 . Potential\ncontamination resulting from cross-dispersion or\nzeroth order confusion was mitigated in these regions by simply ignoring the affected region of an\nindividual order during the computation of the\nfit. The resulting continuum model was then used\nwhen fitting lines.\n2.2.\n\nR\u25e6\n1 + \u03c6\u03c6c +\n\naped.html\n\n4\n\n\f6.7\n\n6.8\n\n\u03c72\n\u22122 \u22121 0 1 2\n\n10\u22123\n\nCounts s\u22121 \u00c5\u22121\n2\u00d710\u22123 3\u00d710\u22123\n\n4\u00d710\u22123\n\nCounts s\u22121 \u00c5\u22121\n5\u00d710\u22124\n10\u22123 1.5\u00d710\u22123 2\u00d710\u22123\n\u03c72\n\u22122 \u22121 0 1 20\n\n6.6\n\n9.1\n\n9.2\n\nWavelength (\u00c5)\n\n9.4\n\nCounts s\u22121 \u00c5\u22121\n2\u00d710\u22124 4\u00d710\u22124 6\u00d710\u22124 8\u00d710\u22124\n\n4\u00d710\u22123\n\n2 0\n\nCounts s\u22121 \u00c5\u22121\n10\u22123\n2\u00d710\u22123 3\u00d710\u22123\n\n\u03c72\n\u22122 0\n\n2 0\n\u03c72\n\u22122 0\n13.3\n\n9.3\n\nWavelength (\u00c5)\n\n13.4\n\n13.5\n\n13.6\n\n21.4\n\n13.7\n\n21.6\n\n21.8\n\n22\n\n22.2\n\nWavelength (\u00c5)\n\nWavelength (\u00c5)\n\nFig. 2.- Fit to the fir triplet G- and R-ratios for, clockwise from top left, Si XIII, Mg XI, O VII, Ne IX showing\nthe predicted line profile in red, data and errors in black and gray respectively.

In Figures 2\nand 3 the triplet regions are shown with residuals, over-plotted models, and computed confidence\ncontours.\n2.3.\n\n3.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe exposure obtained from the Chandra\narchive of \u03b82 Ori A represents the deepest combined high resolution spectroscopic dataset on this\nyoung massive O-star to date. The long exposure\nprovides high statistics in critical emission lines,\nallowing to diagnose its X-ray stellar wind properties beyond the 3\u03c3 level. In a previous study\nSchulz et al. (2006) provided some preliminary results for the quiescent state for less than half of\nthe current exposure. This limited measurements\nof critical line fluxes and widths to uncertainties\nlarger than 50%. Our new analysis greatly reduces these uncertainties to the order of 20%. For\nexample, while the previous analysis could only\nspeculate about possible line broadening of the\norder of 300 km s\u22121 , we now clearly resolve the\nlines to values between 228\u00b134 km s\u22121 for Ne IX\nand 491\u00b1120 km s\u22121 for Si XIII, with an average\nof all lines of 341\u00b138 km s\u22121 . Likewise critical\nline ratios such as the R-ratios are significantly\nimproved, specifically for the cases of Mg XI with\n0.3\u00b10.09 and Si XIII with 1.7\u00b10.4; for the case of\nO VII since its f -line was not detected, we now\nalso have an upper limit.\nThe measured R-ratios are significantly less\nthan Ro (Table 2). In early type stars this is due\nto the substantial UV radiation field provided by\nblackbody radiation of the hot surface temperature (Kahn et al. 2001; Gabriel & Jordan 1969),\nwhich for the O9.7V star in \u03b82 Ori A is about\n30,000 K. In this case the R ratio maps the distance of emission from the stellar surface and we\nutilize this relation to show that the X-ray line\nemission from \u03b82 Ori A is indeed located close\nto the O-star's surface. Schulz et al. (2006) estimated that the emissions could be within several\nstellar radii, Table 2 and Figure 4 show emission\norigins within two stellar radii (dotted line in Figure 4) for Si XIII, Mg XI, and Ne IX with their\n90% uncertainties.\nAnother important result of our analysis is that\nthe measured line centroid positions shown in Table 2 are, with quite high accuracy, at the expected\nion rest wavelengths indicating that there are no\nline shifts within the Chandra sensitivity. This is\nan important result because any shift would indicate fast outward moving sources in a high density wind. The line profiles appear symmetric,\n\nLine Widths\n\nDue to degradation of Chandra image quality at\noff-axis angles, the HETG resolving power likewise\ndecreases. Though the PSF is well defined across\nthe ACIS detector, this degradation becomes a\nproblem for gratings because, owing to the complexity of modeling, responses are only calibrated\nfor zeroth order positions at the instrument nominal pointing.\nThis effect can be critical in line width measurements which may include a significant instrumental broadening signature. Our flux measurements\nare unaffected by the broadening, and we have utilized as much available data as possible to improve\nstatistics. Four of our observations are at off-axis\nangles greater than the others, in particular \u03b82 Ori\nA is greater than 3\u2032 off-axis in obsids 7410, 7411,\n7412, and 8897. We have chosen to ignore counts\nin these obsids during computation of line width\nparameters. There are two exceptions. Si XIV\nand Mg XII where statistics are too poor in the\nabsence of extra counts to obtain reasonable measurements. In these cases we provide upper limits\non the line widths.\nThe average offset of our data is 2\u2032 .1 which is\naround the location where degradation becomes\nnoticeable. Based on analysis of ACIS zeroth order Line Response Functions (LRFs) at large axial\noffsets (e.g. see Chandra POG), we estimate that\nour reported line widths are on the order of up to\n\u223c5% broader than that of identical on-axis profiles.\n\n7\n\n\fTable 2\nLine Measurements\nION\n\nSi XIII\nMg XI\nNe IX\nO VII\n\n\u03bba\n(\u00c5)\n6.650\n9.171\n13.448\n21.602\n\n(10\n\n\u22126\n\nfluxb\nphots\u22121 cm\u22122 )\n\nLine Ratiosc\nG\nR\n\nHe-Like\n1.3\u00b10.3\n4.8\u00b10.6\n28.9\u00b13.3\n147.3\u00b140.9\n\nLines\n1.1\u00b10.3\n1.0\u00b10.1\n1.2\u00b10.1\n0.9\u00b10.3\n\n6.187\n8.423\n12.133\n18.971\n\n2.4\n3.1\n2.8\n4.1\n\nvturb\n(kms\u22121 )\n491\u00b1120\n432\u00b153\n228\u00b134\n274\u00b183\n\nH Ly\u03b1\nHe Ly\u03b1\n\nH-Like Ly\u03b1 Lines\nSi XIV\nMg XII\nNe X\nO VIII\n\n1.7\u00b10.4\n0.3\u00b10.1\n0.1\u00b10.04\n<0.09\n\nRo\n\nd\n\n0.4\u00b10.2\n0.8\u00b10.3\n20.0\u00b12.9\n164.7\u00b122.3\n\n0.3\u00b10.2\n0.2\u00b10.1\n0.7\u00b10.1\n1.1\u00b10.4\n\n<686\n<518\n315\u00b143\n327\u00b153\n\na\n\nMeasured position of resonance line for He-like triplet line groups\n\nb\n\nflux is that of the resonance line only for He-like triplet line groups\n\nc\n\nfor H-Like Ly\u03b1 lines this is the ratio of the H-Like Ly\u03b1 flux to He-Like resonance line flux of the corresponding ion\nd\n\nComputed from APED emissivities according to Eq. 1 at G-ratio derived\ntemperatures (see Table 3)\n\nTable 3\nDerived Temperatures\nION\nO VII\nNe IX\nMg XI\nSi XIII\n\nLog T(H/He)\n6.41\n6.62\n6.70\n6.96\n\n(6.36,\n(6.60,\n(6.65,\n(6.87,\n\n6.44)\n6.64)\n6.72)\n7.02)\n\n8\n\nLog T(G)\n6.3\n6.1\n6.5\n6.4\n\n(6.0,\n(6.0,\n(6.3,\n(6.0,\n\n6.5)\n6.3)\n6.6)\n6.8)\n\n\fexplain our findings. We can rule out significant contributions of unseen low-mass pre-main\nsequence companions by the level of the line\nbroadening. Standard coronal emission would\nshow unresolved lines or moderate broadening\ndue to orbital motion (Brickhouse et al. 2001;\nHuenemoerder et al. 2006); neither is the case\nhere. Colliding winds are ruled out simply by the\nfact this would require an unseen massive companion with a much earlier type than the O9.7,\nwhich would be impossible to hide.\nWe find, however, quite strong similarities to\nthe most massive star in the Orion Trapezium\n\u03b81 Ori C (Schulz et al. 2003; Gagn\u00e9 et al. 2005).\nIn the magnetically confined wind scenario, field\nlines of the magnetic dipole act to channel emitted material from either pole toward the magnetic equator. Simulations by Gagn\u00e9 et al. (2005)\ndemonstrate that these two components meet\nat the magneto-equator and wind plasma with\nhigh tangential velocities reaching up to 1000 km\ns\u22121 collides generating strong shocks and elevate\ngas temperatures to tens of millions of degrees,\nthus producing the observed hard X-ray emission.\nGagn\u00e9 et al. (2005) further demonstrate that the\nconditions for X-ray production are quite specific;\nthe post shock in-falling material is rather cool,\nand the outflowing material's density is too low to\nproduce sufficient X-rays. This places a relatively\ntight constraint on the location of the hard X-ray\nemission around R\u22642R\u22c6 .\nAnother result of the simulations by Gagn\u00e9 et al.\n(2005) states that the post shock-heated material is moving slowly, thus generating observed\nline profiles much narrower than expected for\nnon-magnetic shock-heated X-ray production in\nO stars (Lucy 1982; Waldron & Cassinelli 2001).\nIn order to quantify the expected broadening,\nGagn\u00e9 et al. (2005) recreated emission measure\nand line profiles from the simulations and found\nthat the turbulent broadening is expected to be on\nthe order of 250 km s\u22121 , with little to no blueshift\nin the line centroid position, which is very close to\nwhat we observe in \u03b82 Ori A.\n\nFig. 4.- Dependence of R ratios on the distance\nto the stellar surface of the emission from Si XIII,\nMg XI, Ne IX, O VII. The diamonds show the best\nfit and highlighted lines show 90% confidence limits projected on to dependence curves computed\nfor a stellar surface temperature of 30,000 K. The\nvertical dashed line at 2R\u22c6 represents the approximate theoretical limit for generation of X-rays under the MCWM.\nsupporting a low density wind assumption even\nthough at such low broadening, profile deviations\nare almost impossible to trace even at our data\nquality.\nIn the case of \u03b6 Ori, Waldron & Cassinelli\n(2001) find that lines are resolved with comparatively low Doppler velocities of around 900 km\ns\u22121 , R-ratios that are characteristic of several stellar radii, an extremely small Si XIII R-ratio, and\nsymmetric and unshifted lines. Except for the\nextremely small Si XIII R-ratio, our results seem\nvery similar, if not more extreme with respect to\nline widths and R-ratios. Our line widths indicate\nan even lower shock jump velocity than in the case\nof \u03b6 Ori making the formation of the observed ionization states even more difficult. At 350 km s\u22121\nshock temperatures are expected to not exceed\n2\u00d7106 K. This discrepancy is supported by the\nemissivity distribution of the spectrum which includes X-ray temperatures greater than 25 MK\n(Schulz et al. 2006). These results are difficult to\nreconcile within the standard wind model. In this\nrespect we conclude that a picture of a low density\nwind with shocks produced near its onset is not\nparticularly convincing.\nThere are not many scenarios left which could\n\n4.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have analyzed high resolution X-ray spectra from Chandra on the young massive O star \u03b82\nOri A, totaling over 500 ks in the quiescent state,\n\n9\n\n\fCohen, D.

A. 2003, ApJ, 586, 495\n\nand computed line widths and f ir line ratios for a\nseries of prominent emission lines appearing in its\nspectrum. The resulting measurements show relatively narrow lines at an average width of 341\u00b138\nkm s\u22121 and R-ratio derived X-ray emitting origin\nwithin 2 stellar radii. Comparing these results to\nthe simulation results of Gagn\u00e9 et al. (2005) for \u03b81\nOri C, we argue that the X-ray production mechanism in \u03b82 Ori A is most likely via magnetic confinement of its stellar wind outflows.\nWe have explored other possibilities, including\nstandard O-star wind models and close companions, for the the generation of X-rays in \u03b82 Ori A\nbut find that none of these are ideal for explaining\nthe observed spectral properties. Observed line\nwidths are too low, while shock temperatures too\nhigh to satisfy model predictions in most of these\ncases.\nFinally, we note that this is a comparative analysis, and sets up a case for a more rigorous analysis specifically aimed at magneto-hydrodynamical\nmodeling (MHD) using the MCWM similar to that\nunder-taken for \u03b81 Ori C.\n\nFeigelson, E.
