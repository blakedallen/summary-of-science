We present a general argument showing that,\nin the running coupling case, the Next-to-Leading-Logarithmic (NLL) and\nhigher order terms are irrelevant for the universal asymptotic features of\nthe solutions.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe BFKL equation [1] is known to provide an incomplete description of\nthe hadronic or nuclear collisions in the the high energy limit of QCD. That\nevolution equation relies indeed on the assumption of a dilute partonic content of incoming particles, but it inevitably leads to denser and denser ones.\nIt also violates the Froissart bound and therefore unitarity. At high density,\nand hence at very high energy, coherent collective effects modify the BFKL\nequation by reducing the emission of additional soft gluons. That mechanism of gluon saturation tames the BFKL growth of the cross sections, and\nis expected to restore unitarity. Several evolution equations with saturation\nhave been derived, like the B-JIMWLK [2, 3] or the BK [2, 4] equations,\nimplementing nonlinear effects on top of the BFKL equation. However, the\nresult discussed here is independent of the precise saturation mechanism at\nwork.\nThe features of gluon saturation are well known at the leading logarithmic accuracy (LL) with fixed QCD coupling. The saturation scale Qs (Y ),\nwhich is the typical momentum scale for the onset of nonlinear effects, is\nrelated to the color correlation length in the transverse plane. Hence, that\n\u2217\n\n\u2020\n\nPresented at the School on QCD, Low-x Physics and Diffraction, Copanello, Calabria,\nItaly, July 2007.\nemail: guillaume.beuf@cea.fr\n\n(1)\n\n\f2\n\nGB\n\nprinted on November 3, 2018\n\nscale plays the role of an infrared cut-off for the gluons radiation. By analogy with the Fisher and Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskounov equation, it has\nbeen understood [5] that gluon saturation also back-reacts onto the dilute\nlinear regime. By linearity, the solutions of the fixed coupling BFKL equation can be decomposed as sum of wave solutions, interpreting formally the\nrapidity Y as time and L = log kT2 /\u039b2 as space position for the wave (kT\nbeing the gluon's transverse momentum). If a saturation mechanism is at\nwork, one of these waves solutions, the critical one, is selected dynamically\nin a L interval which is growing with Y . Therefore, the solution loses memory of its initial condition during the evolution, even in the linear domain.\nThe asymptotic shape of the solution and the asymptotic evolution of the\nsaturation scale are then universal. That selection mechanism provides a\nnatural explanation for the geometric scaling [6] observed in the HERA\ndata, as the critical wave solution has precisely that scaling property.\nOne should also consider the effect of running QCD coupling and of\nhigher logarithmic orders, in order to do reliable studies. A first step in that\ndirection consists in replacing by hand the fixed coupling in the LL equation\nby a running coupling, taken for example at a scale equal to the parent gluon\ntransverse momentum kT . In that case, the mechanism of selection of the\ncritical wave solution seems to hold. However, the running coupling leads\nto a quite different universal asymptotic behavior of the solution [5, 7] (see\n[8] for a review). The evolution\n\u221a is slower, and in particular the saturation\n2\nscale behaves as log Qs (Y ) \u221d Y , instead of Y in the fixed coupling case.\nOn the other hand, one can introduce NLL contributions to the kernel,\nbut keeping the coupling fixed, so that the linear part of the evolution\nequation writes formally\nh\n\ni\n\n\u2202Y N (L, Y ) = \u1fb1 \u03c7LL (\u2212\u2202L ) + \u1fb1 \u03c7N LL (\u2212\u2202L ) + O(\u1fb12 ) N (L, Y ) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u1fb1 = Nc \u03b1s /\u03c0, and N is the Fourier conjugate of the dipole target\namplitude. In that case, the asymptotic behavior of the solution is similar\nto the one in the fixed coupling LL case, except that the value of the critical\nparameters are changed, and depends on the NLL kernel eigenvalues [9].\n\n2. Saturation with running coupling and a NLL kernel\nLet us now discuss the most complete case, with both running coupling\nand higher orders. The result presented here was first found in Ref.[10]\nand Ref.[11]. It is possible to resum some of the NLL and higher order\ncontributions by letting the coupling run, for example at the scale kT , i.e.\n\n\fGB\n\n3\n\nprinted on November 3, 2018\n\ntaking \u1fb1(kT2 ) = 1/bL. Then, Eq.(1) rewrites\n\"\n\n1 (1)\n1\n\u03c7 (\u2212\u2202L ) + O\n\u03c7LL (\u2212\u2202L ) +\n\u2202Y N (L, Y ) =\nbL\nbL\n\n\u0012\n\n1\nbL\n\n\u00132 !#\n\nN (L, Y ) .\n\n(2)\nUsing the \u03c9-expansion method of Ref.[12], one replaces Eq.(2) by the effective equation\n\u2202Y N (L, Y ) =\n\n1\n\u03c7ef f (\u2212\u2202L , \u2202Y )N (L, Y ) ,\nbL\n\n(3)\n\nwith a kernel whose eigenvalues are\n\"\n\n#\n\n\u0010 \u0011\n\u03c9 \u03c7(1) (\u03b3)\n+ O \u03c92 .\n\u03c7ef f (\u03b3, \u03c9) = \u03c7LL (\u03b3) 1 + 2\n\u03c7LL (\u03b3)\n\n(4)\n\nIn the brackets in the previous expression, the terms of n-th order \u03c9 n are\nsupposed to have poles of order n at most, at \u03b3 = 0 and \u03b3 = 1. Hence, that\n\u03c9-expansion is safe only when \u03c9 \u226a \u03b3, 1 \u2212 \u03b3. Assuming that condition to\nbe fulfilled, if one tries to solve Eq.(3) in the large Y limit using Laplace\ntransform, one gets the position of the saddle-point \u03c9s \u223c Y \u22121/2 . Thus, for\nlarge enough Y (in practice several\n\u221a rapidity units), the\u221a\u03c9-expansion will be\nsafe, and we will have log N \u221d Y and log Q2s (Y ) \u221d Y . Expanding\nthe\n\u221a\nkernel of Eq.(3) around \u03c9 = 0 and changing variable Y into Y , one gets\nbL\n\u221a \u2202\u221aY N (L, Y ) = \u03c7ef f (\u2212\u2202L , 0) N (L, Y )\n2 Y\n\u0014\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0015\n1\n2\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a \u03c7\u0307ef f (\u2212\u2202L , 0)\u2202 Y + O \u2202 Y N (L, Y ) , (5)\n+\n2 Y\nwhere \u03c7\u0307ef f stands for the derivative with respect to \u03c9. Thanks to Eq.(4), the\nfirst line in Eq.(5) is the LL BFKL equation with running coupling, and the\nsecond line contains the higher order terms. The relevant regime determining the universal asymptotic properties of the solution corresponds to L \u221d\n\u221a\nY \u226b 1, and more precisely to \u03c4 \u223c Y 1/6 \u226b 1, with \u03c4 = log(kT2 /Q2s (Y )) being the geometric scaling variable. Solving Eq.(5) perturbatively at large Y ,\none finds that the three leading orders, corresponding to O(Y 0 ), O(Y \u22121/6 )\nand O(Y \u22121/3 ), features only terms from the first line of Eq.(5). The leading order give the dispersion relation between \u03b3 and \u03c9. In the case of the\ncritical wave solution, which will be the relevant asymptotic solution in the\npresence of gluon saturation, the second order selects \u03b3 = \u03b3c , solution of\n\u03c7LL (\u03b3c ) = \u03b3c \u03c7\u2032LL (\u03b3c ). It determines the leading term of log N (L, Y ) and\nof log Q2s (Y ). Their next-to-leading terms are given by the O(Y \u22121/3 ) order\n\n\f4\n\nGB\n\nprinted on November 3, 2018\n\nterms in Eq.(5). In N (L, Y ), it corresponds to the Airy diffusion factor. Up\nto that order, the NLL kernel has not been relevant.\nTherefore, we have shown that in the running coupling case, the universal asymptotic solution in the linear regime derived in Refs.[5, 7] is valid\nnot only for LL evolution equations with saturation but also for NLL ones\n(or even all orders ones). NLL terms in the kernel can modify the solution\nonly at subleading orders not calculated in Refs.[7, 5]. For example, the\nthird term in the large Y expansion of log Q2s (Y ), which will be of order\nO(Y \u22121/6 ), will be NLL dependant.\nSaturation and running coupling are thus essential ingredients to understand the high energy limit of the partonic content of hadrons, whereas\nother NLL or higher order contribution are not. One should however notice\nthat the behavior of the solutions of saturation equations is more subtle in\nthe running coupling case, and not fully understood [13], by contrast to the\nfixed coupling case.\nREFERENCES\n[1] L.
