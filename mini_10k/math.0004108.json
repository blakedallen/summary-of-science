The original domain is splitted to two domains: inner inside the star and external outside the\nstar. The solutions in these regions are obtained separately and after that they are matched. Before\nwe go to the substantial part of this paper we will describe briefly the physical problem.\n\n2\n\nMain model\n\nBoson stars are gravitationally bound macroscopic quantum states made up of scalar bosons [19, 23,\n6, 14]. They differ from the usual fermionic stars in that they are only prevented from collapsing\ngravitationally by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. For self-interacting boson field the mass of the\nboson star, even for small values of the coupling constant turns out to be of the order of Chandrasekhar's\nmass when the boson mass is similar to a proton mass. Thus, the boson stars arise as possible\ncandidates for non-baryonic dark matter in the universe and consequently as a possible solution of\nthe one of outstanding problems in today's astrophysics - the problem of nonluminous matter in the\nuniverse. Most of the stars are of primordial origin being formed from an original gas of fermions and\n\u2217 This work was supported by Bulgarian National Scientific Fund, Contr.

That is why it should be expected that most stars are a mixture of both,\nfermions and bosons in different proportions.\nBoson-fermion stars are also good model to learn more about the nature of strong gravitational\nfields not only in general relativity but also in the other theories of gravity.\nThe most natural and promising generalizations of general relativity are the scalar-tensor theories\nof gravity [4, 9, 29, 8]. In these theories the gravity is mediated not only by a tensor field (the metric of\nspace-time) but also by a scalar field (the dilaton). These dilatonic theories of gravity contain arbitrary\nfunctions of the scalar field that determine the gravitational \"constant\" as a dynamical variable and\nthe strength of the coupling between the scalar field and matter. It should be stressed that specific\nscalar-tensor theories of gravity arise naturally as low energy limit of string theory [15, 5, 12, 24, 21, 20]\nwhich is the most promising modern model of unification of all fundamental physical interactions.\nBoson stars in scalar-tensor theories of gravity with massless dilaton have been widely investigated\nrecently both numerically and analytically [25, 16, 26, 27, 7, 2, 30]. Mixed boson-fermion stars in scalar\ntensor theories of gravity however have not been investigated so far in contrast to general relativistic\ncase where boson-fermion stars have been investigated [17].\nIn present paper we consider boson-fermion stars in the most general scalar-tensor theory of gravity\nwith massive dilaton.\nIn the Einstein frame the field equations in presence of fermion and boson matter are:\n\u0012B\n\u0013\nF\n1\nn\nn\nn\nn\nn\n+ U (\u03c6)\u03b4m\nGm = \u03ba\u2217 Tm + Tm + 2\u2202m \u03c6\u2202 n \u03c6 \u2212\u2202 l \u03c6\u2202l \u03c6\u03b4m\n,\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\nB\nF\n1\n\u03ba\u2217\n\u2207m \u2207m \u03c6 + U \u2032 (\u03c6) = \u2212 \u03b1(\u03c6) T + T ,\n4\n2\n(1)\n\u2202 W\u0303 (\u03a8+ \u03a8)\n,\n\u2207m \u2207m \u03a8 + 2\u03b1(\u03c6)\u2202 l \u03c6\u2202l \u03a8 = \u22122A2 (\u03c6)\n\u2202\u03a8+\n\u2202 W\u0303 (\u03a8+ \u03a8)\n\u2207m \u2207m \u03a8+ + 2\u03b1(\u03c6)\u2202 l \u03c6\u2202l \u03a8+ = \u22122A2 (\u03c6)\n\u2202\u03a8+\nwhere \u2207m is the Levi-Civita connection with respect to the metric gmn , (m = 0, ..., 3; n = 0, ..., 3).\nThe constant \u03ba\u2217 is given by \u03ba\u2217 = 8\u03c0G\u2217 where G\u2217 is the bare Newtonian gravitational constant. The\nphysical gravitational \"constant\" is G\u2217 A2 (\u03c6) where A(\u03c6) is a function of the dilaton field \u03c6 depending\non the concrete scalar-tensor theory of gravity. W\u0303 (\u03a8+ \u03a8) is the potential of boson field. The dilaton\npotential U (\u03c6) can be written in the form U (\u03c6) = m2D V (\u03c6) where mD is the dilaton mass and V (\u03c6)\nis dimensionless function of \u03c6.\nd\nThe function \u03b1(\u03c6) = d\u03c6\n[ln A(\u03c6)] determines the strength of the coupling between the dilaton field\nB\n\nF\n\n\u03c6 and the matter. The functions T and T are correspondingly the trace of the energy-momentum\nF\n\nB\n\nn\nn\ntensor of the fermionic matter1 Tm\nand bosonic matter Tm\n.

The energy density and the pressure of the fermionic fluid in the Einstein frame are \u03b5 =\nA4 (\u03c6)\u03b5\u0303 and p = A4 (\u03c6) p\u0303 where \u03b5\u0303 and p\u0303 are the physical energy density and pressure. Instead to give\nthe equation of state of the fermionic matter in the form p\u0303 = p\u0303(\u03b5\u0303) it is more convenient to write it in\na parametric form\n\u03b5\u0303 = \u03b5\u03030 g(\u03bc)\n\np\u0303 = \u03b5\u03030 f (\u03bc)\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b5\u03030 is a properly chosen dimensional constant and \u03bc is dimensionless Fermi momentum.\n1 In the present article we consider fermionic matter only in macroscopic approximation, i.e., after averaging quantum\nfluctuations of the corresponding fermion fields. Thus we actually consider standard classical relativistic matter.\n\n2\n\n\fThe physical four-velocity of the fluid is denoted by u\u03bc .

This means that the metric gmn has the form\n\u0001\n(6)\nds2 = exp [\u03bd(R)] dt2 \u2212 exp [\u03bb(R)] dR2 \u2212 R2 d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c8 2\n\nwhere R, \u03b8, \u03c8 are usual spherical coordinates. The field configuration is static when the boson field \u03a8\nsatisfies the relationship\n\u03a8 = \u03c3\u0303(R) exp(i\u03c9t).\n\nHere \u03c9 is a real number and \u03c3\u0303(R) is a real function. Taking into account the assumption that have been\nmade the system of the field equation is reduced to a system of ordinary differential equations. Before\nwe explicitly write the system we are going to introduce a rescaled (dimensionless) radial coordinate\nby r = mB R where mB is the mass of the bosons.

At that we assume the function \u03bc(r) is\ncontinuous in the interval [0, Rs ], whilst the functions \u03bb(r), \u03bd(r) are continuous and the functions\n\u03c6(r), \u03c3(r) are smooth in the whole interval [0, \u221e), including the unknown inner boundary r = Rs .\nThe so posed BVP is a two-parametric eigenvalue problem with respect to the quantities Rs and\n\u03a9.\nLet us emphasize that a number of methods for solving the free-boundary problems are considered\nin detail in [28, 22].\nHere we aim at applying the new solving method to the above formulated problem. This method\ndiffers from that one proposed in [3] and for the governing field equations written in the forms (7) and\n(10) it possesses certain advantage.\n\n3\n\nMethod of solution\n\nAt first we scale the variable r using the Landau transformation [28] and in this way we obtain a fixed\ncomputational domain. Namely\nx=\n\nr\n, x \u2208 [0, 1] \u222a [1, \u221e).\nRs\n\nFor our further considerations it is convenient to present the systems (7) and (10) in following equivalent\nform as systems of first order ODEs:\n\u2212 yi\u2032 + Rs Fi (Rs x, yi , \u03a9) =\n\n\u2212ye\u2032\n\n+ Rs Fe (Rs x, ye , \u03a9) =\n\n0,\n\n(12)\n\n0\n\n(13)\n\nwith respect to the unknown vector functions\nyi (x) \u2261 (\u03bb(x), \u03bd(x), \u03c6(x), \u03be(x), \u03c3(x), \u03b7(x), \u03bc(x))T ,\nye (x) \u2261 (\u03bb(x), \u03bd(x), \u03c6(x), \u03be(x), \u03c3(x), \u03b7(x))T\n\nand right hand sides Fi \u2261 (F1 , F2 , \u03be, F3 , \u03b7, F4 , F5 )T , Fe \u2261 (F1 , F2 , \u03be, F3 , \u03b7, F4 )T where (.)\u2032 stands for\ndifferentiation towards the new variable x.\nFor given values of the parameters Rs and \u03a9 the independent solving of the inner system (12)\nrequires seven boundary conditions. At the same time we have at disposal only six conditions of the\nkind (8) and (9). In order to complete the problem we set additionally one more parametric condition\n(the value of someone from among the functions \u03bb(x), \u03bd(x), \u03c6(x), \u03be(x), \u03c3(x) or \u03b7(x)) at the point x = 1).\nLet us set for example\n\u03c6i (1) = \u03c6s\n\n(14)\n\nwhere \u03c6s is a parameter. Then the boundary conditions (8), (9) and (14) of the inner BVP can be\npresented in the form:\nB0,i yi (0) \u2212 D0,i = 0,\n\nB1,i yi (1) \u2212 D1,i (\u03c6s ) = 0.\n\n(15)\n\nHere the matrices B0,i = diag(1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1), D0,i = diag(0, 0, 0, 0, \u03c3c, 0, \u03bcc ), B1,i = diag(0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1),\nD1,i = diag(0, 0, \u03c6s , 0, 0, 0, 0).\nObviously the solution in the inner domain x \u2208 [0, 1] depends not only on the variable x, but it is\na function of the three parameters Rs , \u03a9, \u03c6s as well, i.e., yi = yi (x, \u03a9, Rs , \u03c6s ).\nIn the external domain x \u2265 1 the vector of solutions\nye (x) \u2261 (\u03bb(x), \u03bd(x), \u03c6(x), \u03be(x), \u03c3(x), \u03b7(x))T\nis 6D. Thereupon six boundary conditions are indispensable to solving of the equation (13). At the\nsame time the three boundary conditions (11) are only known. Let us consider that the solution yi (x)\n5\n\n\fin the inner domain x \u2208 [0, 1] is knowledged. Then we postulate the rest three deficient conditions\nto be the continuity conditions at the point x = 1.The first of them is similar to the condition (14)\nand the else two we assign to arbitrary two functions from among \u03bb(x), \u03bd(x), \u03be(x), \u03c3(x) and \u03b7(x), for\nexample\n\u03bbe (1) = \u03bbi (1),\n\n\u03c6e (1) = \u03c6s ,\n\n\u03c3e (1) = \u03c3i (1).\n\nIt is convenient to present the boundary conditions in the external domain in matrix form again:\nB1,e ye (1) \u2212 D1,e (\u03c6s ) = 0,\n\nB\u221e,e ye (\u221e) = 0\n\n(16)\n\nwhere the matrices B1,e = diag(1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0), D1,e = diag(\u03bbi (1), 0, \u03c6s , 0, \u03c3i (1), 0), B\u221e,e = diag(0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0).\nLet the solutions yi = yi (x, \u03a9, Rs , \u03c6s ) and ye = ye (x, \u03a9, Rs , \u03c6s ) be supposed known. Generally\nspeaking for given arbitrary values of the parameters Rs , \u03a9 and \u03c6s the continuity conditions with\nrespect to the functions \u03bd(x), \u03be(x) and \u03b7(x) at the point x = 1 are not satisfied. We choose the\nparameters Rs , \u03a9 and \u03c6s in such manner that the continuity conditions for the functions \u03bd(x), \u03be(x)\nand \u03b7(x) to be held, i.e.,\n\u03bde (1, Rs , \u03a9, \u03c6s ) \u2212 \u03bdi (1, Rs , \u03a9, \u03c6s )\n\u03bee (1, Rs , \u03a9, \u03c6s ) \u2212 \u03bei (1, Rs , \u03a9, \u03c6s )\n\n\u03b7e (1, Rs , \u03a9, \u03c6s ) \u2212 \u03b7i (1, Rs , \u03a9, \u03c6s )\n\n= 0,\n= 0,\n\n(17)\n\n= 0.\n\nThese conditions should be interpreted as three nonlinear algebraic equations in regard to the unknown quantities Rs , \u03a9 and \u03c6s . The usual way for solving of the above mentioned kind of equations\n(17) is by means of various iteration methods, for example Newton's methods. The traditional technology similarly to the methods like shutting [33], requires separate treatment of the BVPs and the\nalgebraic continuity equations and brings itself to additional linear ODEs for elements of the corresponding to (17) Jacobi matrix. These elements are functions of the variable x and they have to be\nknown actually only at the point x = 1. The solving of the both nonlinear BVPs (12), (15) and (13),\n(16) along with the attached linear equations is another hard enough task.\nAt the present work using the CANM [13], [18] we propose a common treatment of both, differential\nand algebraic problems.\nWe suppose that the nonlinear spectral problem (12), (15), (13), (16) and (17) has a \"well separated\"\n[18] exact solution. Let the functions yi,0 (x), ye,0 (x) and the parameters Rs,0 , \u03a90 , \u03c6s,0 are initial\napproximations to this solution. The CANM leads to the following iteration process:\nyi,k+1 (x)\n\n= yi,k (x) + \u03c4k zi,k (x),\n\n(18)\n\nye,k+1 (x)\nRs,k+1\n\n= ye,k (x) + \u03c4k ze,k (x),\n= Rs,k + \u03c4k \u03c1k ,\n\n(19)\n(20)\n\n= \u03a9k + \u03c4k \u03c9k ,\n= \u03c6s,k + \u03c4k \u03c6k .\n\n(21)\n(22)\n\n\u03a9k+1\n\u03c6s,k+1\n\nHere \u03c4k \u2208 (0, 1] is a parameter which can rule the convergence of iteration process. The increments\nzi,k (x), ze,k (x), \u03c1k , \u03c9k and \u03c6k , k = 0, 1, 2, ... satisfy the linear ODEs (for sake of simplicity henceforth\nwe will omit the number of iterations k):\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202Fi\n\u2202Fi\n\u2202Fi\n\u2032\nzi + Rs\n+ Fi \u03c1 + Rs\n\u03c9 = yi\u2032 \u2212 Rs Fi ,\n(23)\n\u2212 zi + Rs\n\u2202yi\n\u2202Rs\n\u2202\u03a9\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202Fe\n\u2202Fe\n\u2202Fe\nze + Rs\n+ Fe \u03c1 + Rs\n\u03c9 = ye\u2032 \u2212 Rs Fe .\n(24)\n\u2212z\u2032e + Rs\n\u2202ye\n\u2202Rs\n\u2202\u03a9\nAll the coefficients and right hand sides as well in the above two equations are known functions of the\narguments x, Rs , \u03a9 by means of the solution from the previous iteration. We seek for the unknowns\n6\n\n\fzi (x) of equation (23) and ze (x) of equation (24) as a linear combinations with coefficients \u03c1, \u03c9 and \u03c6:\nzi (x)\n\n= si (x) + \u03c1 ui (x) + \u03c9vi (x) + \u03c6wi (x),\n\n(25)\n\nze (x)\n\n= se (x) + \u03c1 ue (x) + \u03c9ve (x) + \u03c6we (x).\n\n(26)\n\nHere si (x), ui (x), vi (x), wi (x), si (x) and se (x), ue (x), ve (x), we (x) are new unknown functions,\nwhich are defined in either, internal or external domains.

For sake of the simplicity we introduce the vector \u1ef9(x) \u2261 (\u03bd(x), \u03be(x), \u03b7(x))T .

Let us assume\nthat the functions yi,k (x), ye,k (x), and parameters Rs,k , \u03a9k , \u03c6s,k are given for k \u2265 0. We solve the\nlinear BVPs (27), (28) and thus we compute the functions si,k (x), ui,k (x), vi,k (x), wi,k (x) in the inner\ndomain x \u2208 [0, 1]. Then we solve the linear BVPs (29), (30) in the external domain x \u2208 [1, \u221e] and\ncompute the functions se,k (x), ue,k (x), ve,k (x) and we,k (x). Next, to obtain the increments \u03c1k , \u03c9k\nand \u03c6k we solve the linear algebraic system (31). So using the decompositions (25), (26) and then the\nformulae (18) - (22) we calculate the functions yi,k+1 (x), ye,k+1 (x), the radius of the star Rs,k+1 , the\nquantity \u03a9k+1 and the parameter boundary condition \u03c6s,k+1 as well at the new iteration stage k + 1.\nAt the every iteration k an optimal time step \u03c4opt is determinated in accordance with the Ermakov&Kalitkin formula [10]\n\u03c4opt \u2248\n\n\u03b4(0)\n\u03b4(0) + \u03b4(1)\n\nwhere the residual \u03b4(\u03c4 ) is calculated as follows\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u03b4(\u03c4k ) = max \u03b4f , (Rs,k + \u03c4k \u03c1k )2 , (\u03a9k + \u03c4k \u03c9k )2 , (\u03c6s,k + \u03c4k \u03c6k )2\n\nand \u03b4f is the Euclidean residual of right hand side of the first equations in the systems (27), (28) and\n(29), (30).\nThe criterion for termination of the iterations is \u03b4(\u03c4opt ) < \u03b5 where \u03b5 \u223c 10\u22128 \u00f7 10\u221212 for some k.\nTaking into account the smoothness of sought solutions we solve the linear BVPs (27), (28) and\n(29), (30) employing Hermitean splines and spline collocation scheme of fourth order of approximation\n[31]. At that we utilize essentially the important feature that everyone of the above mentioned two\ngroups vector BVPs (inner and external) have one and the same left hand sides.\nIt is worth to note that the algebraic systems of linear equations and the system (31) as well become\nill-posed in the vicinity of the \"exact\" solution, i.e., for sufficiently small residuals \u03b4. That is why for\nsmall \u03b4, for example if \u03b4 < 10\u22123 (then \u03c4opt \u223c 1 usually), it is expedient to use the Newton-Kantorovich\nmethod when the respective matrices are fixed for some \u03b4 \u2265 10\u22123 .\n\n4\n\nSome numerical results\n\nFor a purpose of illustrating we will consider and discuss some results obtained from numerical experiments. A detailed description and analysing of results from physical point of view will be object of\nanother our paper.\nIn present article we consider concrete scalar-tensor model with functions (see Section 2)\n3\n\u03c6\nV (\u03c6) = (1 \u2212 A2 (\u03c6))2 ,\nA(\u03c6) = exp( \u221a ),\n2\n3\n\u0011i\n\u0010\u221a\np\np\n1h\n\u03bc+ 1+\u03bc ,\n(2\u03bc \u2212 3) \u03bc + \u03bc2 + 3 ln\nf (\u03bc) =\n8\n\u0011i\n\u0010\u221a\np\np\n1h\ng(\u03bc) =\n\u03bc+ 1+\u03bc ,\n(6\u03bc + 3) \u03bc + \u03bc2 \u2212 3 ln\n8\n1\nW (\u03c3 ) = \u2212\n2\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n8\n\n\u0013\n1 4\n\u03c3 + \u039b\u03c3 .\n2\n2\n\n\fParameters: \u039b = 10, \u03b3 = 0.1, b = 1\n\n0,4\n\nFunction \u03c3(x)\n\n0,3\n\n0,2\n\n0,1\n\n0,0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nRelative Coordinate x\n\nFigure 1: The function \u03c3(x) for \u03c3c = 0.4; \u03bcc = 1.2.\n\n0,00\n\nDilaton Field \u03c6(x)\n\n-0,04\n\n-0,08\n\n-0,12\n\nParameters: \u039b = 10, \u03b3 = 0.1, b = 1\n-0,16\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\nRelative Coordinate x\n\nFigure 2: The function \u03c6(x) for \u03c3c = 0.4; \u03bcc = 1.2.\nThe quantities b, \u039b are given parameters. For completeness we note that in the concrete case the\nfunctions f (\u03bc) and g(\u03bc) represent in parametric form the equation of state of noninteracting neutron\ngas while the function W (\u03c3 2 ) describes the boson field with quartic self-interaction.\nThe calculated functions \u03c3(x), \u03c6(x), \u03bd(x) and \u03bc(x) are plotted correspondingly in Fig. 1, 2, 3 and 4\nfor the values of the parameters \u03b3 = 0.1, \u039b = 10 and b = 1. The behaviour of the mentioned functions\nis typical for wider range of the parameters not only for those values presented in the figures. The\nfunction \u03c3(x) decreases rapidly from its central value \u03c3c = 0.4 (in the case under consideration) to zero,\nat that when dimensionless coordinate x > 6 the function does not exceed 10\u22124 . Similarly the function\n\u03bd(x) has most large derivative for x \u2208 (0, 9) after that it approaches slowly zero at infinity like x1 . For\nexample when x \u2248 9 the derivative \u03bd \u2032 (x) \u2248 10\u22122 , while for x > 27 \u03bd \u2032 (x) < 10\u22124 , i.e., the asymptotical\nbehaviour of calculated grid function and its derivative agrees very well with the theoretical prediction\n(see [3]). The function \u03c6(x) increases rapidly for x < 4, besides that it trends asymptotically to\nzero. Obviously the quantitative behaviour of \u03c6(x) for central value \u03c3c = 0.4 is determinated by the\nB\n\nF\n\ndominance of the term T over the term T (see [3]). At last the function \u03bc(x) is nontrivial in the inner\ndomain x \u2208 [0, 1], i.e. inside the star. Here it varies monotonously and continuously from its central\n9\n\n\f0,0\n\nFunction \u03bd(x)\n\n-0,4\n\n-0,8\n\n-1,2\n\nParameters: \u039b = 10, \u03b3 = 0.1, b = 1\n-1,6\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\nRelative Coordinate x\n\nFigure 3: The function \u03bd(x) for \u03c3c = 0.4; \u03bcc = 1.2.\nvalue (in the case under consideration) \u03bcc = 1.2 till zero at x = 1 corresponding to the radius of the\nstar.\n\nParameters: \u039b = 10, \u03b3 = 0.1, b = 1\n\nDensity of the Fermionic Matter \u03bc(x)\n\n1,2\n\n1,0\n\n0,8\n\n0,6\n\n0,4\n\n0,2\n\n0,0\n0,0\n\n0,2\n\n0,4\n\n0,6\n\n0,8\n\n1,0\n\nRelative Coordinate x\n\nFigure 4: The function \u03bc(x) for \u03c3c = 0.4; \u03bcc = 1.2.\nFrom physical point of view it is important to know the mass of the boson-fermion star and the\ntotal number of particles (bosons and fermions) making up the star.\nThe dimensionless star mass can be calculated via the formula\n!\n\u0012 \u00132\nZ \u221e\nB\nF\n2\n\u03b3\nd\u03c6\n+ V (\u03c6) dr.\nM=\nr2 T00 + T00 + exp(\u2212\u03bb)\ndr\n2\n0\nThe dimensionless rest mass of the bosons (total number of bosons times the boson mass) is given\nby\nMRB = \u03a9\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n2\n\n2\n\nr A (\u03c6) exp\n\n0\n\n10\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bb\u2212\u03bd\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03c3 2 dr.\n\n\fThe dimensionless rest mass of the fermions is correspondingly\n\u0012 \u0013\nZ \u221e\n\u03bb\n2 3\nMRF = b\nr A (\u03c6) exp\nn(\u03bc)dr\n2\n0\n3\n\nwhere n(\u03bc) is the density of the fermions. In the case we consider we have n(\u03bc) = \u03bc 2 (x).\nThe dependencies of the star mass M (solid line) and the rest mass of fermions MRF (dash line)\non the central value \u03bcc of the function \u03bc(x) are shown in configuration diagram on Fig. 5 for \u03bb = 0,\n\u03b3 = 0.1, b = 1 and \u03c3c = 0.002. It should be pointed that for so small central value \u03c3c we have\nin practice pure fermionic star. On the figure it is seen that from small values of \u03bcc to values near\nbeyond the peak the rest mass is greater than the total mass of the star which means that the star is\npotentially stable.\n\nParameters: \u03bb = 0, \u03b3 = 0.1, b = 1, \u03c3c = 0.002\n0,7\n\nMass M\n\n0,6\n\n0,5\n\n0,4\n\nStar mass\nRest mass of fermions\n\n0,3\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nCentral Density of the Fermionic Matter \u03bcc\n\n5\n\nFigure 5: The star mass M and the rest fermion mass MRF as functions of the central value \u03bcc\n\nParameters: \u03bb = 0, \u03b3 = 0.1, b = 1, \u03c3c = 0.002\n\nBinding Energy Eb\n\n0,00\n\n-0,01\n\n-0,02\n\n-0,03\n\n-0,04\n0,2\n\n0,3\n\n0,4\n\n0,5\n\n0,6\n\n0,7\n\nRest Mass of Fermions MR\n\nFigure 6: The binding energy E versus the rest fermion mass MRF\nOn Fig. 6 the binding energy of the star Eb = M \u2212 MRB \u2212 MRF is drawn against the rest mass of\nfermions MRF for \u03bb = 0, \u03b3 = 0.1, b = 1 and \u03c3c = 0.002. Fig. 6 is actually a bifurcation diagram. With\nincreasing the central value of function \u03bc(x) one meets a cusp. The appearance of a cusp shows that\n11\n\n\fthe stability of the star changes - one perturbation mode develops instability. Beyond the cusp the\nstar is unstable and may collapse eventually forming black hole. The corresponding physical results\nfor pure boson stars are considered in our recent paper [11].\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to Prof. I.V.
