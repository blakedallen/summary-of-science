Yan\nmyan@ieee.org\nNetwork Technology Research Centre, Nanyang Technological University\n50 Nanyang Drive, Singapore, 637553\nAbstract\nThis article recounts definition, classification, history, and applications of microstructured\noptical fibers.\n1.\n\nDefinition and Varieties\n\nSince the first microstructured optical fiber (MOF) demonstrated by Knight et al.,1 research\non this class of optical waveguides has thrived. To date, lots of fibers with air-hole inclusions\nwere reported. In fact, to meet different application purposes, the \"holey\" fibers experience\nconstant alterations and they evolve divergently in many directions. Some of fibers deviate\nmuch in structure from that in the very first publication. To address these fibers, several\nnames have been coined-they include photonic crystal fiber (PCF), holey fiber (HF), microstructured optical fiber (MOF), and photonic bandgap fiber (PBGF). \"PCF\", \"HF\", and\n\"MOF\" are defined from structure point of view, whereas \"PBGF\" are defined from opticalproperty point of view. Among the names, MOF is the most general one. In fact, MOF can\nbe used to address all fibers which have their feature size at micrometer (or submicrometer)\nscale. The rest names can be considered as subsets of MOF, and they can't address rigorously\nall MOFs reported in general. For example, \"PCF\" is not appropriate for fibers which lack\nof periodic cladding; \"HF\" is not appropriate for those fibers made of all solid materials;\n\"PBGF\" is certainly only applicable for those guiding light by cladding's photonic bandgap\n(PBG).\nFigure 1 and 2 show novel MOFs made or proposed during recent years. While PBG\nfibers (except the air-silica Bragg fiber) shown in Fig. 2 are observed to adhere to the term\n\"photonic crystal (PC)\" faithfully, index-guiding fibers sometimes can be nothing to do with\nphotonic crystal (for example, the air-clad fiber). We will come across most of the fibers\ndisplayed in these two figures later in Section 3 of this article.\nIndex-guiding MOFs not presented in Fig. 1 include hole-assisted MOFs,13, 14 double-clad\nindex-guiding MOF,3 and \"graded-index\" MOF.15 PBG-guiding MOFs not presented in Fig.\n1\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n(e)\n\n(f)\n\nFig. 1.

Hence in certain places an MOF can be also referred to as PCF\nwithout ambiguity.\nA.\n\nIndex-guiding v.s. PBG-guiding\n\nIn fact, the index-guiding fiber can be considered as a PBG-guiding fiber in the sense that the\npropagation constant of a core mode can not be supported by the cladding. The bandgap\nregion used in an index-guiding fiber is the largest one possessed by the cladding, i.e.,\nthe region below the cladding's radiation line \u03b2 = knclad in \u03b2 \u2212 k plot (\u03b2 is the x-axis\nvalue, \u03b2 = 2\u03c0\nn and k = 2\u03c0\n, with \u03bb free-space wavelength). In this region, the cladding\n\u03bb eff\n\u03bb\ncan't support any propagating mode, as the lightwave (wavelength at \u03bb) in a homogeneous\nn.\nmaterial (refractive index at n) should have its smallest propagation constant at \u03b2 = 2\u03c0\n\u03bb\nAnd the smallest propagation constant happens when the light propagates as a plane wave.\nAny other mode of propagation will increase its propagation constant.\nRefer to Fig. 3, as an infinitely-extending rod of high-index (ncore ) is introduced in an\ninfinitely-extending low-index material (nclad ), due to the fact that the high-index material\nhas its radiation line \u03b2 = kncore positioned lower than that for the low-index material\n\u03b2 = knclad , there exists a region in the \u03b2 \u2212 k plot (enclosed by \u03b2 = kn core and \u03b2 = knclad )\nin which light can propagating in the rod but not in the background material. This is how\na conventional step-index fiber works.\nNow as the homogeneous background material is replaced by a photonic crystal, the\ncladding's radiation line becomes \u03b2 = knfsm , where nfsm is effective index of the fundamental space-filling mode (FSM) of the crystal structure. The main difference between a\ncomposite and a homogeneous material is that, other than the region below its radiation\nline, there are, possibly, some small regions above the radiation line, in which light can't\npropagate in the crystal [Fig. 3(b)]. Indeed, we can make use of these small regions to confine light in a material whose index is smaller than nfsm . This is how a photonic bandgap\nfiber works.\nB. PBG-guiding v.s. Guidance by Antiresonant-reflection\nTo differentiate these two terms, we have to recall the history of the antiresonant-reflecting\noptical waveguide (ARROW).\nMulti-layered substrate was proposed by Ash to replace homogeneous substrate in slab\nwaveguide to guide surface wave in 197019 1 . Such problem was then theoretically treated\n1\n\nThis paper is cited in,20 but is not traceable at this moment by me.\n\n4\n\n\fk\n\n\u03b2 = kn clad\n\n\u03b2 = kncore\n\n(a)\n\n\u03b2\n\u03b2 = kncore\n\nk\n\n\u03b2 = kn fsm\n\n(b)\n\n\u03b2\n\nFig. 3. Schematic dispersion diagrams for: (a) A fiber with a low-index homogeneous cladding\nand a high-index homogeneous core; (b) A fiber with photonic crystal cladding and a homogeneous core. Regions filled with horizontal lines are lightwave states forbidden in the\ncladding material. Region filled with vertical lines are lightwave states allowed in the core\nmaterial. There common regions (grid-shaded regions) are where confined states (allowed in\ncore but not allowed in cladding) are possible. ncore , nclad , nfsm are assumed to be constant\nwith respect to wavelength.\n\n5\n\n\fby A. J. Fox in 1974.20 Both papers call such waveguide as grating waveguide. However,\nFox did not show wave guidance in a low-index material. Two years later, Yeh et al. theoretically demonstrated, by use of Floquet-Bloch theorem, guidance in low-index material\n(air) for a slab waveguide with layered cladding.21 Such waveguide is named by Yeh et al. as\nBragg waveguide. In this paper, very importantly, they used a third material in core region\n(air), and cladding is a periodic structure made of two solid materials. Half a year later,\nCho from Bell Laboratories experimentally confirmed confined propagation in such waveguides.22 In 1978, Yeh et al. put one step further from slab-type waveguides, and proposed\nto use multi-layered cylinders to propagate light in an air column.23 Such fiber is named\nas Bragg fiber. Both slab-type Bragg waveguide and the Bragg fiber were not investigated\nfurther until eight years later in 1986 Duguay et al. fabricated on silicon wafer a Bragg\nwaveguide.24 Their waveguide is however formed by two material, i.e., core material is one of\nthe cladding materials. But Duguay et al. rename the waveguide as \"antiresonant-reflecting\noptical waveguide\" (ARROW) and attribute the guidance to the antiresonance of the highindex layer (analogous to a Fabry-Perot resonator) placed adjacent to the low-index core. To\nsome extent, this paper revives the research on such waveguides. A 2D ridge-type ARROW\nwas also fabricated by Freye et al. in 1994.25\nResearch on ARROW should really be considered as pioneer work on photonic crystal\nwaveguides (bandgap guidance). In fact, these work can easily lead to the concept of photonic\ncrystal. However, as the authors did not generalize the layered dielectric media to other\ndimensions, their impact was limited.\nLet's review what is the traditional ARROW model made popular by Duguay et al.. Refer\nto the simplest slab-type ARROW shown in Fig. 4, the model states that properties of the\nhigh-index layers around the core determines the guidance in the low-index core region. When\nthe high-index cladding layers are in resonance with the core mode, light is relayed outwards\nlaterally by the high-index layers. When the layers are not in resonance (in antiresonance)\nwith the core mode, light is rejected and confinement in low-index core region is achieved. The\nresonant and antiresonant conditions can be quantitatively derived from the Bragg reflection\nconditions for the lateral wavevector component kx (Fig. 4). The lateral phase variation in\na high-index layer is\nq\n\u03c6x = k0\n\nn22 \u2212 n21 * d2 .\n\n(1)\n\nwhere d2 is width of high-index layers. If \u03c6x is equal to odd number of \u03c0/2, the high-index\nlayers are considered to be in antiresonant state with the core mode. Or we can say Bragg\nreflection is met along x-direction. The core mode hence has the least radiation loss under\nthis condition. If \u03c6x is equal to even number of \u03c0/2, the high-index layers are considered to\nbe in resonant state with the core mode. The core mode experiences rapid dissipation after\nbeing launched.\n6\n\n\fkz\nn2 n1\n\nkx\n\nFig. 4. A traditional ARROW waveguide. Refractive index n2 > n1 . The big arrow denotes\nlight is launched into the core region. Notice the core can be made of a third material of\ndifferent index (normally lower than both n1 and n2 ).21 kz is the wavevector component\nin longitudinal direction, which can be more commonly written as \u03b2. kx is the wavevector\ncomponent in lateral direction. Notice for a particular propagation mode, kx has different\nvalues in layers with different refractive indices, whereas the same kz value is shared in all\nlayers.\nThis traditional ARROW model does explain successfully light confinement in a material\nof lower index. It even does not acknowledge the cladding to be periodic (which suggests\nthat we might have missed certain things as nowadays we explicitly use a periodic PC\ncladding to confine light in a lower index material). Also the model can accurately predict\nthe exact highest-loss and lowest-loss wavelength points by considering the high-index layers\nin cladding to be in complete resonance and antiresonance, respectively. However, we would\nlike to point out that ARROW is indeed just another name for regular waveguides whose\nguidance is achieved by the photonic bandgap effect. Antiresonance of cladding composite\ngives rise to a forbidden bandgap. And in fact, we should establish a equation\ncladding bandgap = completely antiresonant state of cladding\n+ partially antiresonant states of cladding.\n\n(2)\n\nIn the ARROW model proposed by Duguay et al., the role of low-index layers in cladding\nregion has been ignored. In fact, their antiresonance also contributes to the confinement of\nlightwave in core region2 . In other words, to better confine light in the core region, we need\n2\n\nHowever, the antiresonance of the low-index layers has less contribution than that of the high-index layers\nto the confinement of lightwave. This can be easily explained by calculating a few lowest-order supermodes (or\nspace-filling modes) of the cladding composite. The first group of modes have about \u03c0 lateral phase variation\nin the high-index layers. The next group of modes have about \u03c0/2 lateral phase variation in the high-index\nlayers. For both mode groups, very little field is located in the low-index layers. If we plot the dispersion\n\n7\n\n\fto tune the widths of both high- and low-index layers in cladding so that they meet their\nanti-resonance conditions together.\nARROW model is straightforward for slab-type waveguides shown in Fig. 4. Nice equations can be written down to determine wavelength points where the lowest and the highest\nleakage loss happen. However, it should be mentioned that such equations are difficult, if\nnot impossible, to be analytically written down for a 2D PBG waveguide. For example, for\nthe all-solid PBG fiber shown in Fig. 2(f), though the resonance conditions for the cladding\nhigh-index rods can be approximately written down using certain expression,26, 27 resonance\ncondition for the low-index cladding region is not. Especially in such 2D waveguides a full\ntransverse bandgap of the cladding is necessary for confining light. Hence we have to consider\nall wavevector components in the transverse direction for analyzing resonance and antiresonance conditions (remember we only considered x-component of the wavevector for slab-type\nwaveguide shown in Fig. 4).\nAt this point, we may conclude that the name \"photonic crystal fiber\" is sometimes misleading, as it gives us the impression that photonic bandgaps can only exist in periodic\ncladding structures. A consequence of the ARROW model is that the cladding of an PBG\nwaveguide does not need to be periodic. Refer to Fig. 4, the most straightforward example\nwould be: the high-index cladding layers can be of certain width to cause \u03c0/2 lateral phase\nvariation, and they also can be thicker to introduce 3\u03c0/2 lateral phase variation. Besides,\nas far as the optimum confinement at a particular wavelength is concerned, the periodicity\nrequirement of the cladding composite is automatically lifted in the case of Bragg fiber (and\nany other 2D PBG waveguide). This is owing to the fact that mode field in a Bragg fiber is\nrepresented by aperiodic Bessel functions3 .23\ncurves for these two groups of modes in a \u03b2-k diagram, the region in between of these two dispersion curve\ngroups is the bandgap used for our guidance. As little field is located in low-index layers, this consequence\nis valid:\nsome small variation in the low-index layer width\n\u2192 little change in two mode groups' dispersion curves\n\u2192 little change in the bandgap\n\u2192 little change in guidance in core region.\nIn above argument, we have assumed the primary bandgap of the cladding is used for guidance. This makes\nsense, as ARROWs and PBGFs fabricated to date almost explicitly use bandgaps found among several\nlowest-order space-filling modes.\n3\nFor a 2D PBG fiber like Bragg fiber, we would however be better off by using a periodic cladding in\npractice. There are several reasons. First, aperiodic cladding can only enhance guidance at a single wavelength\npoint, not the whole cladding PBG window. And improvement in PBG guidance can always be achieved\nby including more cladding layers. Second, fabrication of periodic structure is easier than that of aperiodic\nstructure. Third, periodic structure facilitates deployment of Bloch theorem in bandgap calculation.\n\n8\n\n\fPCF\nCladding\nTPC\n\nHPC\n\nCore\n\n+\nComposite\nTPC\n\nHPC\n\nHomogeneous\nAir\n\nSilica\n\nFig. 5.

HPC stands for \"honeycomb\nphotonic crystal\" (air holes are arranged in a honeycomb lattice).\n2.\n\nPCF Classification\n\nFigure 5 shows the possible configurations of a PCF. This figure has generalized PCF to\nthose made of a PC cladding and a PC core.18 Though we only consider PCs made of two\nmaterials, it should be kept in mind that more materials can be involved. Structurally, only\nPCs exhibiting C6v symmetry are presented owing to their ease of fabrication. Depending\non fabrication method, other-latticed PCs should be able to exist.\nFrom Fig. 5, a particular two-material fiber can be named accurately by mentioning the\ncladding and core structures. For example, if the cladding is TPC and core is HPC, then the\nfiber can be referred to as a TPC-HPC fiber; for a fiber with TPC cladding and silica core,\nwe can name it as solid-core TPC fiber; for a fiber with TPC cladding and air core, we can\nname it as air-core TPC fiber, etc.\nBesides those shown in Fig. 5, we should mention that a MOF can have a homogeneous\ncladding and a PC core.28\n1.\n\nTriangular v.s. Honeycomb\n\nThese two terms are sometimes confusing. Early PCFs are made of circular air holes in silica\nbackground. Hence, we normally tell a PCF's cladding type according to the placement of\nair holes. However, as PCF design gets complicated, such as air-guiding TPC fiber and HPC\nfiber shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), the fiber cladding is more close to silica rods immersed in air\nbackground.8, 29 If we define the lattice according to position of the silica pillars, traditional\nTPC (HPC) becomes HPC (TPC).\n9\n\n\fAddressing the lattice pattern of a PC can also be ambiguous without specifying corresponding lattice vectors. For a traditional HPC, if we use a second-level unit-cell, the crystal\nbecomes a TPC.18\nIn this thesis, we stick to traditional naming convention, i.e., a crystal structure is defined\nby the air hole positions, though the air holes may not be circular. Also, the primitive basis\nvectors are normally used for defining the crystal's lattice pattern, unless otherwise stated.\n3.\n\nTechnology Review and Current Trends\n\nA.\n\nIndex-guiding MOF\n\n1.\n\nTechnology Review\n\nThe possibility of fabricating a fiber whose cladding is made of photonic crystal was first\nproposed in30 4 . In this paper, Birks et al. theoretically showed that full 2D photonic bandgaps\nexist in an air-silica (holes-in-silica) photonic crystal (PC) when the off-plane wavevector\ncomponent is large enough. And they suggest \"a new type of optical fibre, the PBG fibre,\nis possible\" by using \"a periodic air/silica cladding surrounding a uniform core\". \"The core\ncan be solid silica or a hollow air region\". One year later, the same group published a\npaper on the first fabricated photonic crystal fiber (PCF).1 As the central defect is silica,\nthe fiber does not guide light using PBG effect. Though Knight et al. have included the\nterm \"photonic crystal\" in naming the waveguide, the fiber, in principle, is equivalent to\na conventional step-index fiber (SIF). Lack of PBG guidance, however, does not prevent\nsuch fiber being exceptional. Knight et al. identifies an interesting property, i.e., it has is a\nvery broad single-mode operation wavelength range (458nm\u223c1550nm for the fiber reported,\nwith \u039b = 2.3\u03bcm and d/\u039b = 0.15). Their work attracted immediately lots of attention and\nrelated studies were carried out by different research groups around the world. More special\nwaveguiding properties were reported. In year 1998, Mogilevtsev et al. theoretically studied\ngroup velocity dispersion (GVD) of PCFs,34 and found some novel dispersion properties, such\nas zero-dispersion point at short wavelength and large normal dispersion value at 1550nm,\ncan be easily achieved by adjusting the fiber parameters (\u039b and d). The dispersion tuning in\nsuch fibers was later overwhelmingly studied by researchers. To name a few, dispersion-flatten\nPCFs were studied in,35\u201339 dispersion-compensating PCFs were studied in.40\u201343 Remarkable\nbirefringence property of PCFs were also reported on several occasions in the literature. They\n4\n\nHere we would like to draw attention to the paper published in 1978 by Yeh et al. on Bragg fiber.23\nStrictly speaking, their work should be regarded as the first paper on fiber design employing a photonic\ncrystal (1D) cladding. However, they did't generalize the idea to 2D and 3D situations. Their work was put\ninto practice by a group of people in MIT about 20 years later (for example, see31 and16 ). This is quite\nsimilar to the case that 1D photonic crystal was first explained by Lord Rayleigh in 1887, but revived by E.\nYablonovitch32 and S. John33 100 years later. There are always some people ahead of time.\n\n10\n\n\finclude.4, 44\u201346 Nonlinear optics in PCFs is also demonstrated to be promising as the fibers\ncan be fabricated with ultrahigh nonlinearity can be fabricated using large-sized cladding air\nholes and small silica core. Among all nonlinear effects, third-harmonic generation in PCF\ncan be found in,47 four-wave mixing can be found in, for example,,48, 49 Raman effect can be\nfound in,50\u201352 supercontinuum phenomenon can be found in, for example,53\u201355 etc, etc.\nIt should be mentioned that beside using silica, other materials are also explored for,\nespecially, index-guiding PCF design. The materials include high-lead silicate glass, tellurite\nglass, gallium lanthanum chalcosulfide glass, and also polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA).\nThe first three types of glasses have quite low softening temperature, hence they are also\ncalled soft glasses. Using these soft glasses to fabricate PCFs has been summarized in.56 Two\nthermally-matched soft glasses have also been used to form an index-guiding PCF.6 The first\npolymer PCF was reported in.57\n2.\n\nTrends\n\nThough confinement loss of index-guiding MOF has been reduced to 0.48 dB/km,58 we don't\nsee immediate necessity to deploy such fiber into transmission system. There are several reasons for this: first of all, the loss is still higher than conventional step-index fiber; second,\nthe cost is certainly higher as compared to standard commercial step-index fiber5 ; third,\ncompatibility (such as splicing) with existing system is still a problem. Index-guiding MOF\ncan indeed be tailored to have some excellent property in certain aspect, but not all aspects.\nIn next few years, application of such fibers would, most probably, still be limited to subsystems or optical devices. In particular, exploration of high nonlinearity and high birefringence\nproperties in MOFs would be likely to attract fair amount of attention. Its deployment in\nfiber lasers will also be a very meaningful research topic.\nB. PBG-guiding MOF\n1.\n\nTechnology Review\n\nThe first PCF whose guidance is due to existence of its cladding PC's photonic bandgap\n(PBG) was reported in year 1998 by Knight et al.59 However, the propagating light concentrates in silica portion within the core region, which is inevitable as the fiber's cladding is of\nhoneycomb lattice and the core is made of air-silica composite.18 The first air-guiding PBG\nfiber was reported in 1999 by Cregan et al.60 The transmission spectrum is measured using a\nshort fiber of a few centimeter length. It is claimed to be single-mode. However, the authors\n5\n\nMOF uses only pure silica, therefore its preform is cheaper in terms of material as compared to conventional SIFs where doping of chemical element is involved. But stacking of preform bundle is labor-intensive\n(there is currently no better way to prepare the preform) and the uncertainties involved during fabrication\n(dust contamination, fluctuation in pressure controlling etc) is higher than that for conventional fiber. Unless\nhigh-level automation is realized, it is correct to conclude that MOFs are more expensive.\n\n11\n\n\fdidn't convincingly prove their point. Fiber technique is greatly improved in the following\nseveral years. By year 2003, loss is greatly reduced to 13dB/km at 1500nm by Corning.7 And\nin year 2004, lowest fiber loss is even as small as 1.2 dB/km.61, 62\nAir-guiding PBG fiber was originally proposed for ultra-low loss optical communication.\nIn addition, it was said that signal propagating in such fiber is \"free of group velocity\ndispersion\". However, to date, we have achieved neither of these two goals. The loss is\nstill high compared to conventional step-index fibers. The group velocity dispersion is quite\nlarge, especially near bandgap edges.63 Recently it is found that there are uncertainties in\nsuch fiber's polarization mode dispersion (PMD) property.64 What's more, a true low-loss\nsingle-mode air-guiding PBG fiber has never been fabricated. All these factors would prevent\nsuch fiber from being deployed for long-haul transmission link at this moment. However, due\nto the unique hollow-core feature, it has thrived in areas like high-power pulse delivery,65, 66\nnonlinear optics in gases,67, 68 atom guiding,69 and sensing applications,70 etc.\nBesides hollow-core PBG fibers, there exist several types of solid-core PBG fibers. Theoretical work on this can be traced to71 and.27 Experimentally, two soft glasses have been used\nto fabricate a PBG fiber by Luan et al.12 Doped silica has also been used to form scatterers in\nthe cladding region of a solid-core PBG fiber.72 It was observed that such low-index contrast\nPBG fiber has wider transmission window.72 However, no particular application has so far\nbeen identified using these types of fibers, largely due to the fact that light is confined in a\nsolid core, which is quite analogues to conventional step-index fiber.\nBesides using 2D PC to form a PBG fiber's cladding, cylindrical-1D PC was also exploited\nfor confining light in a hollow core. Omniguide fiber, or Bragg fiber, was first fabricated by\nFink et al .31 The same group has demonstrated using Bragg fiber to deliver high-power CO2\nlaser.16 Recently, they have produced such fiber with transmission window near IR (0.85\nto 2.28\u03bcm) wavelength.73 Vienne et al. fabricated the so-called air-silica Bragg fiber whose\ncladding highly resembles a cylindrical-1D PC.11 Very similar Bragg fiber has also been\nfabricated very recently by Agyros et al. using air and polymer.74 However, the air-silica\nBragg fiber suffers from a very fragmented transmission window.75 Whereas Bragg fibers\nmade by Fink's group has three materials (core is made of air, cladding is made of soft\nglass and polymer bi-layers), people have also tried to fabricate Bragg fibers using two solid\nmaterials (core material is one of the cladding materials with lower index). These include.17, 76\n2.\n\nTrends\n\nThe traditional air-guiding PBG fiber uses a TPC cladding. Such 2D PC was recently generalized by Yan et al .29 It is found that by slightly modifying the PC structure, it is possible to\ntune the bandgap favorably for different purposes, e.g., smaller leakage or even true singlemode air-guiding etc. A hollow-core fiber with such PC cladding was theoretically studied\n\n12\n\n\fin.77 The fiber has very wide surface-mode-free PBG guiding wavelength range and it promotes single-mode operation. Technologically speaking, fabrication of such fiber does not\nimpose any additional difficulty as compared to conventional air-guiding PBG fiber. It will\nbe very interesting to see an actual fiber in near future.\nHPC cladding was not considered to achieve air guiding until its capability was theoretically validated by Yan et al.78 Such fiber's leakage loss was later studied in.8 The hollow-core\nof such fiber can be less than 6\u03bcm in diameter, which suggests single-mode operation is\npossible. Also the surface-mode problem has been completely mitigated in such fibers. Airguiding HPCF can be a competitive alternative to existing air-guiding PBG fibers if they\ncan be fabricated successfully.\nAs we have mentioned, the first fabricated honeycomb PBG fiber has an air-silica composite core.59 The idea of using two different pieces of PCs to form a fiber (core and cladding\nare both composite) was put forward by Yan et al.18 Depends on the design, PBG-guiding\nor index-guiding can be achieved in such fibers. Such fibers are expected to perform better\nin application of gas or liquid sensor. Also, they should have important applications that\nexploit the phenomenon of discrete soliton.79\nAs compared to air-silica PBGFs, Bragg fiber suffers significantly higher radiation loss.\nNew types of high index-contrast, low-absorption dielectric materials which are matched in\nthermal properties (softening temperatures, expansion coefficients, viscosity) and chemical\nproperties (non-diffusive to each other) need to be identified to fabricate more robust hollowcore Bragg fiber. Preferably, the guidance should be around 1550nm wavelength point. For\nair-silica Bragg fiber fabricated by Vienne et al., more theoretically work is necessary to\nunderstand its leakage loss. It might be possible to prevent the fragmentation of the transmission window by an improved design. If that indeed happens, we can reduce the overall\nleakage loss by increasing the number of air-hole rings in the cladding.\nApplication-wise, high-power pulse or beam delivery will still be an important direction to\ngo.80 Nonlinear optics in such fibers with gas- or liquid-filled core will also be very interesting.\nReferences\n1.
