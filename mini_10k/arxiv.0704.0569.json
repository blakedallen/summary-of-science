Therefore their omplete investigations take\ntime and require signi\u001c ant amounts of produ ts. In this\nontext, roboti \u001duidi workstations have already met a\ngreat su ess and proved their e\u001e ien y for instan e in\nthe genome sequen ing and analysis [1\u2104. However, these\ninstruments remain very expensive, need important labor, and the volumes involved (\u2264 mL) are still too large\nfor some spe i\u001c appli ations (e.g. proteomi s) [2, 3\u2104.\nNowadays, other high throughput te hniques based on\nmi ro\u001duidi s [4, 5\u2104 an o\u001ber suitable alternative solutions\nfor the development of rapid s reening tools. Mi ro\u001duidi\ndevi es are now largely used in biologi al and hemi al\n\u001celds for multiple appli ations [6\u2104 like mole ular separations and ells sorting [7\u2104, polymerase hain rea tion\n[8, 9\u2104, rapid mi romixing and analysis of hemi al rea tions [10, 11, 12, 13\u2104. . . Moreover, the development of\nmi rovalves and mi romixers has made possible the produ tion of highly integrated systems whi h an be used\nto address individually hundreds of rea tion hambers\n[14\u2104. These devi es are well adapted to arry out high\nthroughput s reening of phase diagrams, parti ularly in\nthe ase of protein rystallization investigation. However,\ntheir fabri ation and multiplexing are still ompli ated.\nAnother possible strategy is the use of droplets playing\nthe role of nanoliter-sized rea tion ompartments. These\ndroplets an be produ ed in spe i\u001c mi ro\u001duidi geometries [15\u2104, and their volume and hemi al omposition an\nbe \u001cxed in a ontrolled way. In addition, they also allow\na rapid mixing of the di\u001berent ompounds, prevent from\nany hydrodynami dispersion and ross ontamination,\nand an be stored in mi ro hannels (see Ref. [16\u2104 and\nreferen es therein). Su h a strategy has already proved\nto be useful for rystallization studies: e.g. s reening\nof protein rystallization onditions [17, 18\u2104, or rystal\nnu leation kineti s measurements [19\u2104.\nFigure 1 summarizes the main insights of our work.\n\n\u2217 Ele troni\n\naddress: philippe.laval-exterieur\beu.rhodia. om\n\nWe have engineered a new mi ro\u001duidi hip that allow\na dire t and quantitative reading of two-dimensional diagrams. Hundreds of nanoliter-sized droplets of di\u001berent hemi al ompositions an be stored in parallel miro hannels, and a temperature gradient applied along\nthese hannels enables us to obtain a two-dimensional\narray of droplets of di\u001berent on entrations and temperatures. For solubility diagram s reening, droplets ontaining a given solute are \u001crst stored with a gradual variation\nof on entration. Then, rystallization in the droplets is\nindu ed by ooling, and \u001cnally, the appli ation of an adequat temperature gradient dissolves rystals in droplets\nwhose temperature is higher than their solubility temperature. As a result, we dire tly read the limit between\ndroplets with and without rystals as shown on Fig. 1( ),\nwhi h gives the solubility temperatures of the solution at\nthe di\u001berent on entrations.\nIn the materials and methods se tion, we des ribe the\nmi ro\u001duidi devi e, the method used to store the droplets\nin the hannels, and the temperature ontrol setup. We\nalso hara terize the on entration and temperature gradients. In the last se tion, we present an experimental\nproto ol to measure quantitatively solubility diagrams\nusing this devi e. We demonstrate its e\u001e ien y by measuring with only 250 \u03bcL of solution, the solubility urve\nof an organi ompound.\n\nII.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nA.\n\nMi rofabri ation\n\nThe\nmi ro\u001duidi\ndevi e\nis\nfabri ated\nin\npoly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) by using softlithographi te hniques [20\u2104. PDMS (Sili one Elastomer\nBase, Sylgard 184; Dow Corning) is molded on master\nfabri ated on a sili on wafer (3-In h-Si-Wafer; Siegert\nConsulting e.k.) using a negative photoresist (SU-8 2100;\nMi roChem). To make molds of 500 \u03bcm height, we spin\nsu essively two 250 \u03bcm thi k SU-8 layers on the wafer.\nAfter ea h spin oating pro ess, the wafer is soft-baked\n(10 min/65\u25e6 C and 60 min/95\u25e6 C). Photolithography is\nused to de\u001cne negative images of the mi ro hannels.\nEventually, the wafer is hard-baked (25 min/95\u25e6 C) and\n\n\f2\n\n(a)\n\n1\n2\n\n1 cm\n3\nc1\n\n\u2207C\n\nis then peeled o\u001b the mold and holes for the inlets\nand outlets (1/32 and 1/16 in. o.d.) are pun hed into\nthe material. Then, the PDMS surfa e and a lean\nsili on wafer surfa e (3-In h-Si-Wafer; 500 \u03bcm; Siegert\nConsulting e.k.) are a tivated for 2 min in a UV ozone\napparatus (UVO Cleaner, Model 144AX; Jelight) and\nbrought together. Finally, the devi e is pla ed at 65\u25e6 C\nfor 2 hr to improve the sealing.\n\nc10\n\n\u2207T\nB.\n\n(b)\n\nDroplet storage proto ol\n\nThe devi e, presented on Fig. 1(a), is omposed of\nthree inlets and ten outlets lo ated at the extremities\nof hannels 1 to 10 . As shown on Fig. 1(b), ea h outlet is onne ted to a \u2248 20 m long rigid tubing (FEP\n1/16 in.) ended with a pie e of soft PVC tubing (Nalgene, \u2248 5 m long) inserted in an automated pin h ele trovalve (105S\u001501059P; As o Jou omati ). Thanks to\nthis system, ea h outlet an be independently losed or\nopened by pin hing or not the orresponding PVC tubing. However, the pin hing out of a tube leads in a liquid\ndispla ement. To minimize the subsequent liquid disturban e in the mi ro hannels, the ele trovalves are pla ed\nlose to the rigid ones, and the hydrodynami resistan e\nafter the ele trovalves is kept as weak as possible using\nlarge tubing.\n\n(c)\n\n\u2207C\n\n\u2207T\n\nFIG. 1: (a) Design of the mi ro\u001duidi devi e ( hannels width\n500 \u03bcm).

A mixture\n10:1 of PDMS is molded on the SU-8 master des ribed\nabove (65\u25e6 C/60 min). The rossed linked PDMS layer\n\nSili one oil (500 St; Rhodorsil) is inje ted in inlet 1 at\nonstant \u001dow rate Q1 \u2248 3 mL hr\u22121 , and aqueous phases\nare inje ted at \u001dow rates Q2 and Q3 ranging from 0 to\nabout 1 mL hr\u22121 , in inlets 2 and 3 respe tively. All\nliquids are inje ted with syringe pumps (PHD 2000 infusion; Harvard Apparatus). At the interse tion between\nthe oil and the aqueous streams, monodisperse droplets\nof the aqueous phase in oil are ontinuously produ ed\n[21\u2104. Both the droplet volume (about 100\u0015300 nL) and\ntheir produ tion frequen y (typi ally between one to ten\ndroplets per se ond) an be tuned by the ratio of oil to\naqueous phase \u001dow rates. The droplet omposition is\nmonitored by the ratio Q2 /Q3 .\nThanks to the possible opening and losing of ea h outlet, we an store droplets of given aqueous ompositions\nin the di\u001berent storage hannels i . Several steps are ne essary to perform su h a \u001clling. First, all the hannels\nare initially \u001clled with sili one oil. Se ondly, the outlet of\nhannel 1 is opened and all the others are losed. In this\non\u001cguration, all the droplets of a given omposition \u001dow\nthrough 1 . Finally, on e the \u001dow is stable, the outlet of\n1 is suddenly losed and simultaneously, the outlet of\nhannel 2 is opened. All the droplets previously present\nin 1 stay immobilized whereas the other droplets, whose\nomposition an be hanged, \u001dow through 2 . Su essively, in the same way, we an store droplets of various\nompositions in all hannels i .\n\n\f3\nC.\n\nChemi al\n\nomposition\n\nontrol\n\nFor solubility investigations, the ontrol of the onentrations in the droplets is ru ial. However, be ause\nof PDMS elasti ity and syringe pumps pre ision, an ina ura y in droplet on entration remains. To estimate\nthis error, we have performed investigations with a onfo al Raman mi ros ope (HR800 Horiba; Jobin-Yvon).\nA 50\u00d7 mi ros ope obje tive was used for fo using a\n532 nm wavelength laser beam in the droplets, and for\nolle ting Raman s attered light, subsequently dispersed\nwith a grating of 600 lines per millimeter. To minimize\nthe out-of-fo us ba kground signals, we \u001cxed the onfo al pinhole at 500 \u03bcm. Experiments were performed\non droplets made of two initial aqueous solutions of\nK4 Fe(CN)6 (0.5 M) and K3 Fe(CN)6 (0.5 M) inje ted in\ninlets 2 and 3 respe tively. These two ompounds display\nstrong and distin t Raman signals [22\u2104.\nFigure 2 shows three Raman spe tra measured\nin droplets ontaining di\u001berent on entration ratios\nRC =[K4 Fe(CN)6 \u2104/[K3 Fe(CN)6 \u2104.

The\non entration of ea h ompound an be probed from the\narea under their spe i\u001c Raman bands by:\nAi = Ki Ci tV ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Ai is the area under the Raman band of the ompound i, Ci its on entration, Ki a spe i\u001c onstant, t\n\nthe a quisition time, and V the analysis volume. As a\nonsequen e, the ratio RA of the Raman bands areas of\nK4 Fe(CN)6 and K3 Fe(CN)6 is proportional to the onentrations ratio RC , and does not depend on the a quisition parameters.\nIn order to optimize the \u001clling proto ol, we \u001crst use Raman mi ros opy to follow the kineti s of the on entration stabilization in the droplets after a sudden hange in\nthe aqueous phases \u001dow rates. Indeed, due to the PDMS\nelasti ity and the inje tion system (syringe pumps), the\n\u001cnite response time of the devi e does not allow instantaneous hange of the on entrations. To estimate this\nresponse time, we have performed the following experiment: for t < 0 s, Q2 = 0 and Q3 = 500 \u03bcL hr\u22121 , and\nfor t > 0 s, Q2 = Q3 = 250 \u03bcL hr\u22121 . Droplets \u001crst\n\u001dow through hannel 1 whi h is losed after 30 s. Then,\ndroplets are stored in \u001cve other hannels after 1, 2, 4,\n6, and 10 min. Thus, Raman spe tra obtained from the\ndroplets in the di\u001berent hannels enable us to follow the\nevolution of RA as a fun tion of time after the \u001dow rates\nhange. Figure 3(a) shows it rea hes almost a onstant\nvalue after 60 s meaning the on entrations be ome stable after this time. Su h measurements illustrate that\n20 min long proto ols are e\u001e ient to store droplets of\ndesired ompositions in the ten hannels (\u2248 2 min per\nhannel).\nA se ond series of experiments was performed to estimate and hara terize the on entration gradient we\nan apply in the devi e. The storage hannels are \u001clled\nwith droplets of di\u001berent on entrations in K3 Fe(CN)6\nand K4 Fe(CN)6 set from the \u001dow rates. In ea h hannel\ni , to rea h a stable droplets omposition, we maintain\nthe \u001dow for 90 s before losing the outlet to store them\n[see Fig. 3(a)\u2104. By measuring the Raman spe tra of the\ndroplets omposition in the di\u001berent hannels, we obtain the ratio RA as a fun tion of the theoreti al ratio\n0\nRC\n= Q2 /Q3 . The error bar orresponds to the standard deviation of the measurements performed on the\ndroplets in a given hannel. As an be seen on Fig. 3(b),\n0\na linear relationship between RA and RC\nis observed as\nexpe ted. Deviations of a few per ents around the linear\nlaw are probably due to the Raman measurements unertainties, to the a ura y of the inje tion system, and\nalso to the PDMS elasti ity.\nThese Raman measurements demonstrate that with\nthe developed proto ol, we are able to store hundreds\nof droplets in ten hannels in about 20 min, and onsuming less than a few hundreds of \u03bcL of solution. We\nbelieve that more rigid and smaller mi rodevi es ombined with even more rea tive inje tion system would\nde rease signi antly the amount of liquids used when \u001clling the hannels.

Sin e the two Peltier\nmodules are independant, we an heat or ool the devi e, and also apply important temperature gradients.\nWe use a sili on wafer as hip support to optimize thermal transfers and thus to reate regular temperature gradients along the storage hannels. Thin thermo ouples\n(type K, 76 \u03bcm o.d., 5SRTC-TTKI-40-1M; Omega) measure the temperature of the devi e along three series of\npositions parallel to the storage hannels. The \u001crst series\nis pla ed above 1 , the se ond one between 5 and 6 , and\nthe third one below 10 [see Fig. 1(a)\u2104.

This is due to the size of the\nPeltier module as ompared to the size of the droplet\nstorage area: smaller storage area, or larger Peltier modules, would give homogeneous temperature pro\u001cles along\nthe transverse dire tion of the hannels.\n\n\f5\nIII.\n\nRESULTS\n\n(a)\nIn the previous se tion we have shown that our mirodevi e allows us to build a two-dimensional array of\ndroplets with both on entration and temperature gradients. We now present an appli ation of this hip by\nmeasuring the solubility urve of an organi solute.\nSu h measurements are arried out with an adipi a id\nsolution previously prepared in a beaker. It is made of\n10.14 g of adipi a id (99%; Aldri h) in 50.66 g of deionized water. The solubility temperature of the solution\nis 63\u25e6 C. To avoid any rystallization before the droplets\nformation, the syringe ontaining the solution and the\norresponding tubing are heated at about 65\u25e6 C with two\n\u001dexible heaters (Min o) ontrolled with temperature ontrollers (Min o). A stereo mi ros ope (SZX12; Olympus)\nwith an obje tive (DF PLFL 0.5\u00d7 PF; Olympus) enables\nus to observe the devi e during the solubility study.\nWe inje t the adipi a id solution in inlet 2 and deionized water in inlet 3. By hanging the \u001dow rates ratio\nwe \u001cll the storage hannels with droplets whose on entration in adipi a id varies from 20 g / 100 g of water\nin hannel 1 down to 6 g / 100 g of water in 10 . The\nmassi on entration C in the droplets is al ulated a ording to:\nC0\nC=\n1 + (1 + C 0 )Q3 /Q2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere C 0 is the massi on entration of the initial adipi\na id solution, Q2 and Q3 the respe tive \u001dow rates of the\nsolution and water (we he ked that density variations indu ed by the presen e of adipi a id are negligible). The\nmi ro\u001duidi hip is kept at about 65\u25e6 C using the Peltier\nmodules to avoid any rystallization during the droplet\nstorage. Before stopping the droplets in a hannel, we\nmaintain it open for 90 s for \u001dow stabilization. In these\nonditions, the total \u001clling of the ten hannels is rea hed\nin less than 20 min and only 250 \u03bcL of solution are spent.\nAfter the droplet storage, rystallization is indu ed by\nooling. Note that the mean time of rystal nu leation\nis inversely proportional to the rea tor volume. Indeed,\nthe nu leation frequen y is given by 1/JV where J is the\nnu leation rate that does no depend on the volume V\nof the rea tor (see Refs. [19, 24, 25, 26\u2104 and referen es\ntherein). Crystal nu leation in a droplet of 100 nL is\nthus 104 times longer than in a vial of 1 mL. To redu e\nsu h long indu tion time, we apply a strong ooling to\nin rease signi\u001c antly the supersaturation. In our ase,\ndown to \u2248 \u22125\u25e6 C, rystals appear in all the droplets after\na few minutes.\nTo obtain the solubility urve dire tly on the hip, we\nthen apply a temperature gradient between 32 and 65\u25e6 C\nafter the rystallization step. Crystals dissolve in all the\ndroplets whose temperature is higher than their solubility temperature. In the other droplets, rystals are partly\nsolubilized but still exist (the equilibrium is rea hed in\nabout 20 min). Typi al images of the storage area are\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 5: Images of a part of the storage area obtained under\nrossed polarizers. Droplets of adipi a id solution are stored\nin the hannels. The on entration in adipi a id was gradually hanged between the upper and the bottom hannels.\nAfter rystallisation of all the droplets, a temperature gradient is applied (low temperature on the left and high temperature on the right). (a) The dotted line separating droplets\nontaining rystals from empty droplets give an estimation\nof the solubility limit. (b) Same image but with a di\u001berent\nontrast displaying the droplets positions.\n\npresented on Fig. 5. Sin e adipi a id rystals have birefringent properties, they are easily dete ted under rossed\npolarizers. The smallest dete table rystals size is about\n50\u00d750 \u03bcm2 at the magni\u001c ation used. Figure 5(a) enables us to dire tly observe the limit of rystal presen e.\nUsing interpolated temperature pro\u001cles su h as the one\ndisplayed in Fig. 4, allows us to estimate the solubility\ntemperatures for all the ten on entrations (we hoose\nthem in the middle of the two su essive droplets with\nand without rystals). Figure 6 presents su h solubility\ntemperatures measured with our mi ro\u001duidi devi e. The\nerror orresponds to the temperatures di\u001beren e between\nthe two droplets en losing the solubility limit positions.\nThese results are in good agreements with data obtained\nfrom literature [27\u2104.\nNaturally, the errors done on su h measurements depend on the distan e between two su essive droplets,\nand on the amplitude of the temperature gradient. In\nour ase, the temperature gradient of 0.7\u25e6 C mm\u22121 and\na typi al distan e of 3 mm between two droplets give an\nerror of \u00b11\u25e6 C. The appli ation of smaller temperature\n\n\f6\nature. We believe that the use of non-permeable materials su h as glass, instead of PDMS, ould easily broaden\nthe possibilities o\u001bered by our system.\n\n20\n\nC\n\n15\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n10\n\n5\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\nT (\u00b0C)\nFIG. 6: (\u2022) Solubility of adipi a id in water measured in the\nase of a temperature gradient of 0.7\u25e6 C mm\u22121.
