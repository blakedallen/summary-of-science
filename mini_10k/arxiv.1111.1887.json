It has\nmixed morphology, e.g., shell-like in radio and centerfilled in the X-ray [3]. As described in Kothes et al. [4],\nthis is an old SNR evolving through the later stages of the\nSedov phase, or early into the radiative (where a significant amount of the shock energy is being radiated away).\nResults from Byun et al. [5] suggest that the unusual\nradio features and the central thermal X-ray enhancements of HB 21 might be the result of an interaction\nwith molecular clouds. One form of evidences for the interaction between the SNR and the molecular cloud in\nHB 21 is the discovery of shocked molecular clumps by\nKoo et al. [6]. The center-filled, thermal X-ray emission\nis suggested to be caused by interaction with molecular\nclouds.\nFlux-calibrated images and spectra of the extended\nremnant HB 21 in the optical range, are presented in\nMavromatakis, Xilouris & Boumis [7]. Filamentary and\npatchy structures were detected and appear to be correlated with the radio emission.\nSignificant spatial variations in spectral index are\nfound in HB 21 [8]. He consider different physical mechanisms for spectral index changes, including a detailed\nconsideration of ionization losses in the dense molecular\ngas interacting with HB 21.\nOne of the main goals of this paper is to provide evidence for Leahy's [8] theoretical proposal. He suggests\n\n\u2217 Corresponding\n\nauthor:dusborka@vinca.rs\n\nthat if the spectra below 408 MHz show flatter spectral\nindices then absorption by thermal plasma would be the\npreferred mechanism. We show the evidence of spectrum\nflattening at the low radio frequencies in the supernova\nremnant HB 21.\n\nII.\n\nDATA AND METHOD\n\nMeasured data at five frequencies are used: 1420\n[9], 820 [10], 408 [11], 34.5 [12] and 22 MHz\n[13].\nThese surveys are available in electronic\nform in \"Flexible Image Transport System\" (FITS)\ndata format, at the site of \"Max-Planck-Institut\nf\u00fcr Radioastronomie\" (MPIfR) near Bonn, Germany:\nhttp://www.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/survey.html. Using\nthis online Survey Sampler allows users to select a region\nof the sky and obtain images and data at different frequencies. The 1420-MHz Stockert survey [9] has resolution 0\u25e6 .59, the 820-MHz Dwingeloo survey [10] 1\u25e6 .2, the\n408-MHz all-sky survey [11] 0\u25e6 .85, the 34.5-MHz Gauribidanur survey [12] 0\u25e6 .7 and 22 MHz [13] 1\u25e6 .7. The corresponding observations are given at\nthe following rates\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n(measured data) for both l and b: 14 at 1420 MHz, 12 at\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n820 MHz, 13 at 408 MHz , 15 at 34.5 MHz and 14 at 22\nMHz. The effective sensitivities are about 50 mK Tb (Tb\nis for an average brightness temperature), 0.20 K, 1.0 K,\nabout 700 K and about 500 K, respectively.\nWe extracted observed brightness temperatures from\nthis data and then using programs in C and FORTRAN,\nobtained results shown in this paper.\nThe area of HB 21 SNR is enclosed with brightness\ntemperature contours. The maps of a region in HB 21\nSNR, in new Galactic coordinates (l, b), with contours of\nthe brightness temperatures Tb are plotted in Figs. 1-5.\nThe contour lines correspond to the brightness temperatures: minimum, maximum and nine contours in be-\n\n\f2\nTABLE I: Temperatures and brightnesses of HB 21 at 1420, 820, 408, 34.5 and 22 MHz.\nFrequency Temperature limits Temperature\nBrightness\n(MHz)\nTmin , Tmax (K)\n(K)\n(10\u221222 W/(m2 Hz Sr))\n1420\n6.0, 9.0\n1.50 \u00b1 0.05\n9.26 \u00b1 0.30\n820\n16.5, 26.0\n4.91 \u00b1 0.20\n10.13 \u00b1 0.40\n408\n87, 140\n32.2 \u00b1 1.0\n16.43 \u00b1 0.50\n49000, 81000\n18237 \u00b1 700\n66.60 \u00b1 2.56\n34.5\n22\n105000, 144000\n28530 \u00b1 500\n43.34 \u00b1 0.76\n\ntween. The space between minimum and maximum contours defines HB 21 SNR. The Galactic longitude and\nlatitude intervals for HB 21 SNR are the following: l =\n[90\u25e6 , 87.5\u25e6 ], b = [3.5\u25e6 , 6\u25e6 ]. We used the same method\nof calculation as given in Borka [14] for Galactic radio\nloops I\u2013VI, Borka, Milogradov-Turin & Uro\u0161evi\u0107 [15] for\nLoops V and VI, Borka Jovanovi\u0107 & Uro\u0161evi\u0107 [16] for\nMonoceros loop and in Borka Jovanovi\u0107 & Uro\u0161evi\u0107 [17]\nfor Cygnus loop.\nThe mean temperatures and surface brightnesses of\nthis SNR are computed using data taken from radiocontinuum surveys at 1420, 820, 408, 34.5 and 22 MHz.\nThe areas over which an average brightness temperature\nis determined at each of the five frequencies are taken to\nbe as similar as possible within the limits of measurement\naccuracy. However, some differences between these areas\nstill remain and we think that the major causes of differing borders between the five frequencies are measured\naccuracy and small random and systematic errors in the\ndata. The surface brightness of SNR must be above the\nsensitivity limit of the observations and must be clearly\ndistinguishable from the Galactic background emission\n[18]. In order to evaluate brightness temperatures over\nthe SNR we took into account background radiation (see\nWebster [19]). Borders enclosing the SNR are defined to\nseparate the SNR from the background.\nWe have subtracted the background radiation, in order to derive the mean brightness temperature of the\nSNR alone. The areas over which an average brightness\ntemperature is determined at each of the five frequencies\nare taken to be as similar as possible within the limits\nof measurement accuracy. Tmin from Table I means the\nlower temperature limit between the background and the\nSNR, and Tmax means the upper temperature of the SNR.\nWe used all measured values inside the corresponding regions of l and b, to calculate the brightness temperature\nof a SNR including the background. The mean brightness temperature for the SNR is found by subtracting the\nmean value of background brightness temperature from\nthe mean value of the brightness temperature over the\narea of the SNR.\nAfter deriving the mean brightness temperatures T \u03bd ,\nwe derived surface brightnesses \u03a3\u03bd by:\n\u0001\n\u03a3\u03bd = 2k\u03bd 2 /c2 T\u03bd .\n\n(1)\n\nwhere k is Boltzmann constant and c the speed of light.\nResults are given in Table I.\n\nTABLE II: Brightnesses of HB 21 reduced to 1000 MHz, using\nspectral index \u03b1 = 0.45 \u00b1 0.07.\nFrequency Brightness reduced at 1000 MHz\n(MHz)\n(10\u221222 W/(m2 Hz Sr))\n1420\n10.83 \u00b1 0.64\n820\n9.27 \u00b1 0.24\n408\n11.01 \u00b1 0.38\n14.80 \u00b1 3.10\n34.5\n22\n7.88 \u00b1 2.08\n\nIII.\n\nDISCUSSION AND RESULTS\n\nThe results for temperature limits are given in Table I.\nTmin, given in the second column of Table I, is the lower\ntemperature limit, while Tmax is the upper temperature\nlimit given in the third column of Table I. There are\nsome other sources near the SNR and they do not affect\nthe calculation. These temperature limits enable us to\ndistinguish the SNR from background and also from external sources. Then we derived the temperatures and\nthe surface brightnesses using equation (1) for each frequency. These results are given in the forth and fifth\ncolumns of Table I, respectively. Brightnesses of HB 21\nreduced to 1000 MHz, using spectral index \u03b1 = 0.45 \u00b1\n0.07 are given in Table II.\nThe radio map of HB 21 SNR at 1420 MHz with contours of brightness temperature is given in Fig. 1. This\nSNR has position: l = [90.\u25e6 , 87.5\u25e6 ]; b = [3.5\u25e6 , 6\u25e6 ], in\nnew Galactic coordinates (l, b).

The contour interval is 0.3\nK Tb , starting from the lowest temperature of 6 K up to\n9 K.

However in some SNRs, observations\nover a very broad range of radio frequencies reveal a curvature in the spectra of these sources [8, 20]. The detection of thermal emission at radio frequencies from Galactic SNRs shows us whether these sources are interacting\nwith adjacent molecular clouds. It might also be useful\n\n\f4\n\nb\n\nb\n8\n\n8\n\n7\n\n7\n\n6\n\n6\n\n5\n\n5\n\n4\n\n4\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n92\n\n91\n\n90\n\n89\n\n88\n\n87\n\n86\n\n92\n\n91\n\n90\n\nFIG. 3: The same as Fig. 1, but for 408 MHz.

The presence of a significant\namount of thermal emission will produce a curvature in\nthe observed radio spectrum of the SNR, particularly for\nfrequencies of 1 GHz and greater [21].\nThe radio continuum spectrum of HB 21 SNR (temperature vs frequency), is presented in Fig. 6.

In\nthe papers Baars, Mezger & Wendker [22], MilogradovTurin & Nikoli\u0107 [23] spectra are represented by second\norder polynomial fit. For our spectra we used polynomial\nfit of third order.

Open circles represent values of spectral indices at the five observed frequencies. We noticed flatter spectral indices at low frequencies below about 200\nMHz. Probably this is due to the thermal mechanism\nat frequencies below about 200 MHz or below observed\nfrequency of 408 MHz. Absorption by thermal plasma is\nprobably the preferred mechanism in the low frequency\nrange of the spectra as it is proposed by Leahy [8].\nFrom the curved spectrum, we can also calculate spectral index \u03b1c using equation (4). In this case \u03b1 is function\nof \u03bd, and therefore for mean \u03b1 we use:\n\n1.0\n0.5\n\nc\n\n( )\n\n0.0\n-0.5\n-1.0\n-1.5\n-2.0\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\n1400\n\n1\n\u1fb1 =\n\u03bdmax \u2212 \u03bdmin\n\n(MHz)\n\nc\n\nFIG. 8: Variations of spectral index \u03b1c (\u03bd) with frequency in\nthe case of HB 21. Spectral index \u03b1c (\u03bd) is obtained from the\nthird order polynomial fit presented in Fig. 7. Open circles\nrepresent values of spectral indices \u03b1c (\u03bd) at the five observed\nfrequencies.\n\nEquation (2) represents the dependence between\nbrightness temperature, frequency as well as brightness\ntemperature spectral index \u03b2, (\u03b2 = \u03b1 + 2, where \u03b1 represents flux density spectral index) and K is a constant.\nEquation (3) represents third order polynomial fit and\ntells us about dependance T of \u03bd. Using equations (2)\nand (3) and after taking a log of both sides of equations\nand derivation of both sides with respect of \u03bd we obtained\nexpression:\n\u03b1c (\u03bd) = \u2212(b + 2c log \u03bd + 3d log2 \u03bd) \u2212 2.\n\n(4)\n\nwhere index c denotes curved spectrum.\nWe want to stress that the same procedure can be used\nif spectra is given in flux density because relation (1)\nholds between brightness \u03a3\u03bd and brightness temperature\nT\u03bd and between flux density S\u03bd and brightness \u03a3\u03bd relation holds:\nS \u03bd = \u03a3\u03bd \u03a9\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03a9 is the solid angle.\nThe new equation will be the same as equation (3), but\nwith different coefficients.\nlog S\u03bd = a\u2032 + b\u2032 log \u03bd + c\u2032 log2 \u03bd + d\u2032 log3 \u03bd.\n\n(6)\n\nWe choose spectrum given in Tb because our original\ndata are given in Tb , not in the flux density.\nUsing these parameters and equation (4) we can derive\nthe dependence of spectral index with frequency along\nthe entire frequency range from 22 to 1420 MHz. Variations of spectral index \u03b1c (\u03bd) with frequency in the case\nof HB 21 is presented in Fig. 8. Spectral index \u03b1c (\u03bd)\n\n\u03bdZ\nmax\n\n\u03b1c (\u03bd)d\u03bd,\n\n(7)\n\n\u03bdmin\n\nwhere \u03bdmin = 22 MHz and \u03bdmax = 1420 MHz.\nUsing eqs. (4) and (7) we obtain \u1fb1c22\u22121420 = 0.46. When\nwe put \u03bdmin = 22 MHz and \u03bdmax = 34.5 MHz the result\nis \u1fb1c22\u221234.5 = -0.97.\nSince we deal with mean brightness temperature, we\nlose the information about index variation because for\neach frequency we have only one average value for brightness temperature. Using equation (2) we get a connection between brightness temperature and spectral index\n\u03b1. We plot the dependence log T vs log \u03bd. The dependence log \u03bd between 408, 820 and 1420 MHz can be nicely\nrepresented by straight line. Leahy [8] obtained mean\nspectral index \u03b1 = 0.45 using observations presented at\n408 and 1420 MHz, and from our Fig. 8 using only points\nat 408 and 1420 MHz we obtained the \u03b1 = 0.47 which is\nin excellent agreement with Leahy's value. But if we take\ninto account low frequencies 22 and 34.5 MHz we can find\nthat now dependence log T vs log \u03bd is nicely represented\nby the polynomial fit of third order.\nThis indicates that the spectrum of HB 21 is a combination of synchrotron and a thermal components. The\npresence of the additional component in the radio spectrum of HB 21 suggests that HB 21 is probably interacting with an adjacent molecular cloud.\nB.\n\nT \u2212 T plot\n\nThe measured data have different resolutions for different frequencies. In order to obtain T \u2212 T plots the data\nare retabulated. We convolved data at 1420, 34.5 and 22\nMHz to 0\u25e6 .25 \u00d7 0\u25e6 .25 resolution. Sampling rates of the\n820 MHz and 408 MHz survey are much more crude and\nwe did not take it into account. Then, for each frequency\npair we used only the common points (with the same\n(l, b)) which belong to the loop area at both frequencies.\nIn that way we reduced loop area to the same area for\ndifferent frequencies. The obtained T \u2212 T plots for three\npairs of frequencies enabled calculating the spectral indices. We calculated two \u03b1 values for each of these tree\nfrequency pairs: between 1420\u201334.5, 1420\u201322, 34.5\u201322\n\n\f7\nMHz. For each of the tree frequency pairs, by interchanging the dependent and independent variables we have obtained two \u03b1 values for each pair and the mean value of\nthese fit results is adopted as the radio spectral index, as\nsuggested in Uyaniker et al. [24]. Regarding two pairs\nof frequencies 1420\u201334.5, 1420\u201322 the average value of\nspectral index from T \u2212 T is < \u03b1T T >1420\u221222,1420\u221234.5\n= 0.47 \u00b1 0.29. Regarding the lowest pair of frequencies\n34.5\u201322, the average value of spectral index from T \u2212 T\nis < \u03b1T T >34.5\u221222 = -0.82\u00b10.82.\nIt can be noticed that this value agrees well with the\ncorresponding value obtained from spectrum, as expected\n(see Uyaniker et al. [24]).\nLeahy [8] determined in HB 21 SNR a mean spectral\nindex of 0.45. Our mean spectral index is in agreement\nwith Leahy findings. He found significant spectral index\nvariations and concluded that thermal absorption was\nthe preferred mechanism [8]. He concluded that if thermal plasma absorption or ionization losses are the correct mechanism, at frequencies below 408 MHz should\nshow flatter spectral indices and if one should be able\nto distinguish which mechanism is working, since ionization losses will have no indices flatter than 0.25 [8]. We\nobtained flatter spectral indices then 0.25 for the HB 21\nSNR in the low frequency domain, and we can expect that\nthermal plasma absorption is responsible for the spectral\nflattening at the lowest radio frequencies.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nabout 500 K Tb for 22 MHz.\nWe present the radio continuum spectrum of the HB\n21 SNR using average brightness temperatures at five frequencies. As it can be seen from Fig. 6, given linear fit\nprovides reliable spectral index. Our analysis indicates\nthat significant spectral variations for different frequencies in spectral index are found in HB 21. We noticed\nflatter spectral indices at frequencies below 408 MHz as\nit is proposed by Leahy [8].\nThis indicates that the spectrum of HB 21 is a combination of synchrotron and thermal components. The\npresence of the additional component in the radio spectrum of HB 21 suggests that this SNR is interacting with\nan adjacent molecular cloud.\nIn Leahy [8], observations of the SNR HB 21 are presented at 408 and 1420 MHz. He considered different\nphysical mechanisms for spectral index variations. He\nconcluded that if the spectra below 408 MHz show flatter spectral indices then absorption by thermal plasma\nis the preferred mechanism. Our obtained spectra at 5\nfrequencies leads to a similar conclusion.\nWe note an obvious flattening of the spectral indices.\nIn future work one might investigate a broader frequency\nrange. Probably, thermal emission at higher frequencies\nwill produce a curvature in the radio spectrum of the HB\n21 SNR, particularly for frequencies higher then 1 GHz\n[21].\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe use observations of the continuum radio emission at\n1420, 820, 408, 34.5 and 22 MHz for estimations of the\nmean brightness temperatures and surface brightnesses\nof the HB 21 SNR.
