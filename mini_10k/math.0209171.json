Introduction\nThe purpose of this note is to prove two statements on the slopes of effective divisors on\nthe moduli space of stable curves Mg : first that the Harris-Morrison Slope Conjecture fails to\nhold on M10 and second, that in order to compute the slope of Mg for g \u2264 23, one only has\nto look at the coefficients of the classes \u03bb and \u03b40 in the expansion of the relevant divisors. The\nproofs are based on a general result providing inequalities between the first few coefficients of\neffective divisors on Mg . We give the technical statements in what follows.\nOn Mg we denote by \u03bb the class of the Hodge line bundle, by \u03b40 , . . . , \u03b4[g/2] the boundary\ndivisor classes corresponding to singular stable curves and by \u03b4 := \u03b40 + * * * + \u03b4[g/2] the total\nboundary. If E \u2282 Pic(Mg ) \u2297 R is the effective cone, then following [HMo] we define the slope\nfunction s : E \u2192 R \u222a {\u221e} by the formula\n[g/2]\nX\na\nci \u03b4i , where ci \u2265 0}.\ns(D) := inf { : a, b > 0 such that a\u03bb \u2212 b\u03b4 \u2212 D \u2261\nb\ni=0\nP[g/2]\nFrom the definition it follows that s(D) = \u221e unless D \u2261 a\u03bb \u2212 i=0 bi \u03b4i with a, bi \u2265 0 for all\ni (and it is well-known that s(D) < \u221e for any D which is the closure of an effective divisor on\n[g/2]\nMg ). In the second case one has that s(D) = a/mini=0 bi . We denote by sg the slope of the\nmoduli space Mg , defined as sg := inf {s(D) : D \u2208 E}. The Slope Conjecture of Harris and\nMorrison predicts that sg \u2265 6 + 12/(g + 1) (cf. [HMo] Conjecture 0.1). This is known to hold\nfor g \u2264 12, g 6= 10 (cf. [HMo] and [Ta]).\n\nFollowing [CU], we consider the divisor K on M10 consisting of smooth curves lying on\na K3 surface, and we denote by K its closure in M10 . For any g \u2265 20, we look at the locus\nin Mg of curves obtained by attaching a pointed curve of genus g \u2212 10 to a curve in K with a\nmarked point. This gives a divisor in \u220610 \u2282 Mg , which we denote by Z.\nThe key point in what follows is that, based on the study of curves lying on K3 surfaces,\none can establish inequalities involving a number of coefficients of any effective divisor coming\nfrom Mg in the expansion in terms of the generating classes.\nP[g/2]\nTheorem 1.1. Let D \u2261 a\u03bb \u2212 i=0 bi \u03b4i be the closure in Mg of an effective divisor on Mg .\n(a) For 2 \u2264 i \u2264 9 and i = 11 we have bi \u2265 (6i + 18)b0 \u2212 (i + 1)a. The same formula holds for\ni = 10 if D does not contain the divisor Z \u2282 \u220610 .\nResearch of GF partially supported by the NSF Grant DMS-0140520.\nResearch of MP partially supported by the NSF Grant DMS-0200150.\nWe thank Joe Harris and Rob Lazarsfeld for interesting discussions on this subject.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nG. FARKAS and M. POPA\n\n(b) (g \u2265 20) If D contains Z, then either b10 \u2265 78b0 \u2212 11a as above, or b10 \u2265 (71.3866...) * b0 \u2212\n(10.1980...) * a.\n(c) We always have that b1 \u2265 12b0 \u2212 a.\nPart (a) (and (c)) of this theorem essentially only make more concrete results \u2013and\nthe technique of intersecting with special Lefschetz pencils\u2013 already existing in the literature\nmentioned above. Part (b) however is more involved: it requires pull-backs to M10,1 and the\nintrinsic use of our partial knowledge about the divisor K, plus some facts about the Weierstrass\ndivisor on Mg,1 . Here we claim more originality.\nCorollary 1.2. If a/b0 \u2264 71/10, then bi \u2265 b0 for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 9. The same conclusion holds\nfor i = 10 if a/b0 \u2264 6.906 . . ., and for i = 11 if a/b0 \u2264 83/12.\nBased on this we obtain that the divisor K \u2282 M10 provides a counterexample to the\nSlope Conjecture. Its class can be written as\nK \u2261 a\u03bb \u2212 b0 \u03b40 \u2212 . . . \u2212 b5 \u03b45 ,\nand by [CU] Proposition 3.5, we have a = 7 and b0 = 1. In view of Corollary 1.2, this\ninformation is sufficent to show that the slope of K is smaller than the one expected based on\nthe Slope Conjecture.\nCorollary 1.3. The slope of K is equal to a/b0 = 7, so strictly smaller than the bound 78/11\npredicted by the Slope Conjecture. In particular s10 = 7 (since by [Ta] s10 \u2265 7).\nTheorem 1.1 also allows us to formulate (at least up to genus 23, and conjecturally\nbeyond that) the following principle: the slope sg of Mg is computed by the quotient a/b0 of\nthe relevant divisors. We have more generally:\nTheorem 1.4. For any g \u2264 23, there exists \u01ebg > 0 such that for any effective divisor D on\nMg with sg \u2264 s(D) \u2264 sg + \u01ebg we have s(D) = a/b0 , i.e. b0 \u2264 bi for all i \u2265 1.\nConjecture 1.5. The statement of the theorem holds in arbitrary genus.\nTheorem 1.1 is proved in \u00a72. Theorem 1.4 is proved in \u00a73, where we also remark that the\nmethods of the present paper give a very quick proof of the fact that the Kodaira dimension\nof the universal curve Mg,1 is \u2212\u221e for g \u2264 15, g 6= 13, 14.\n2. Inequalities between coefficients of divisors\nLet Fg be the moduli space of canonically polarized K3 surfaces (S, H) of genus g. We\nconsider the Pg -bundle Pg = {(S, C) : C \u2208 |H|} over Fg which comes with a natural rational\nmap \u03c6g : Pg \u2212 \u2212 > Mg . By Mukai's results [Mu1] and [MM], this map is dominant if and only\nif 2 \u2264 g \u2264 9 or g = 11. In this range Mg can be covered by curves corresponding to Lefschetz\npencils of curves on K3 surfaces (cf. [Ta]). This is not true any more when g = 10: in this\ncase Im(\u03c610 ) is a divisor K in M10 (cf. [CU] Proposition 2.2).\nGiven 2 \u2264 i \u2264 11, consider as above a Lefschetz pencil of curves of genus i lying on a\ngeneral K3 surface of degree 2i \u2212 2 in Pi . This gives rise to a curve B in the moduli space Mi .\nNote that any such Lefschetz pencil, considered as a family of curves over P1 , has at least one\nsection, since its base locus is nonempty.\n\n\fEFFECTIVE DIVISORS ON Mg\n\n3\n\nLemma 2.1. We have the formulas B * \u03bb = i + 1, B * \u03b40 = 6i + 18 and B * \u03b4j = 0 for j 6= 0.\nProof. The first two numbers are computed e.g. in [CU] Proposition 3.1, based on the formulas\nin [GH] pp. 508\u2013509. The last assertion is obvious since there are no reducible curves in a\nLefschetz pencil.\n\u0003\nFor each g \u2265 i + 1, starting with the pencil B in Mi we can construct a new pencil Bi in\nMg in the following way: we fix a general pointed curve (C, p) genus g \u2212 i. We then glue the\ncurves in the pencil B with C at p, along one of the sections corresponding to the base points\nof the pencil. We have that all such Bi fill up \u2206i \u2282 Mg for i 6= 10, and the divisor Z \u2282 \u220610\nwhen i = 10.\nLemma 2.2. We have Bi * \u03bb = i + 1, Bi * \u03b40 = 6i + 18, Bi * \u03b4i = \u22121 and Bi * \u03b4j = 0 for j 6= 0, i.\nProof. This follows immediately from Lemma 2.1 and from general principles, as explained in\n[CR] pp.271.\n\u0003\nProof. (of Theorem 1.1 (a), (c)) (a) Let us fix 2 \u2264 i \u2264 11, i 6= 10. Since D is the closure of\na divisor coming from Mg , it cannot contain the whole boundary \u2206i . Thus we must have a\npencil Bi as above such that Bi * D \u2265 0. The same thing holds true for i = 10 if we know that\nZ is not contained in D. But by Lemma 2.2 this is precisely the statement of this part.\n(c) This is undoubtedly well known. One follows the same procedure, but this time producing\na pencil B1 in \u22061 \u2282 Mg by gluing a fixed pointed curve (C, p) of genus g \u2212 1 to a generic\npencil of plane cubics along one of its 9 sections. We have the well-known relations:\nB1 * \u03bb = 1, B1 * \u03b40 = 12, B1 * \u03b41 = \u22121 and B1 * \u03b4j = 0 for j 6= 0, 1.\nThe conclusion follows similarly, since we can find a B1 such that B1 * D \u2265 0.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe study of the coefficient b10 is more involved, since in M10 the Lefschetz pencils of\ncurves on K3 surfaces only fill up a divisor. We need some preliminaries on divisors on the\nuniversal curve Mg,1 . Let \u03c0 : Mg,1 \u2192 Mg be the forgetful morphism. The generators of\nPic(Mg,1 ) \u2297 Q are the tautological class \u03c8 = c1 (\u03c9\u03c0 ), the boundary \u03b40 , the Hodge class \u03bb,\nand for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 g \u2212 1 the class \u03b4i corresponding to the locus of pointed curves consisting of\ntwo components of genus i and g \u2212 i respectively with the marked point being on the genus i\ncomponent.\nLemma 2.3. (cf. [AC] \u00a71) One has the following relations:\n\u03c0\u2217 (\u03bb2 ) = \u03c0\u2217 (\u03bb * \u03b4i ) = \u03c0\u2217 (\u03b40 * \u03b4i ) = 0 for all i = 0, . . . , g \u2212 1, \u03c0\u2217 (\u03c8 2 ) = 12\u03bb \u2212 \u03b4,\n\u03c0\u2217 (\u03bb * \u03c8) = (2g \u2212 2)\u03bb, \u03c0\u2217 (\u03c8 * \u03b40 ) = (2g \u2212 2)\u03b40 , \u03c0\u2217 (\u03c8 * \u03b4i ) = (2i \u2212 1)\u03b4i for i \u2265 1,\n\u03c0\u2217 (\u03b4i2 ) = \u2212\u03b4i for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 g \u2212 1, \u03c0\u2217 (\u03b4i * \u03b4g\u2212i ) = \u03b4i , for 1 \u2264 i < g/2, and\n\u03c0\u2217 (\u03b4i * \u03b4j ) = 0 for all i, j \u2265 0 with i 6= j, g \u2212 j.\nWe consider the Weierstrass divisor in Mg,1\nW := {[C, p] \u2208 Mg,1 : p \u2208 C is a Weierstrass point},\n\n\f4\n\nG.

If \u03c0 : Mg,1 \u2192 Mg is the forgetful morphism, then \u03c0\u2217 (W ) is an effective\ndivisor class on Mg .\nProof.

When g is even bg/2 = (8g 5 + 28g 3 + 33g4 + 4g2 )/64. On the other\nhand we have expressions for the classes of distinguished geometric divisors on Mg : when g + 1\nis composite, by looking at Brill-Noether divisors one sees that the class\n(g + 3)\u03bb \u2212\n\n[g/2]\nX\ng+1\n\u03b40 \u2212\ni(g \u2212 i)\u03b4i\n6\ni=1\n\nis effective (cf. [EH] Theorem 1). When g + 1 is prime one has to use the class of the\nPetri divisor, which gives a slightly worse estimate (cf. [EH] Theorem 2). In either case, by\ncomparing the coefficients a, bi above with those of these explicit effective classes, one obtains\n2\nan effective representative for \u03c0\u2217 (W ). For instance when g + 1 is composite it is enough to\ncheck that b0 /a \u2264 (g + 1)/(6g + 18) and that bi /a \u2264 i(g \u2212 i)/(g + 3) for i = 1, . . . , [g/2], which\nis immediate.\n\u0003\nCorollary 2.5. Let D be any effective divisor class on Mg,1 . Then \u03c0\u2217 (W * D) is an effective\nclass on Mg .\nProof. (of Theorem 1.1 (b)) Assume that b10 < 78b0 \u2212 11a. We consider the map\nj : M10,1 \u2212\u2192 Mg\nobtained by attaching a fixed general pointed curve of genus g \u2212 10 to any curve of genus 10\nwith a marked point. Our assumption says that R * j \u2217 (D) < 0, where R \u2282 M10,1 denotes the\ncurve in the moduli space coming from a Lefschetz pencil of pointed curves of genus 10 on a\ngeneral K3 surface. We can write j \u2217 (D) = m\u03c0 \u2217 (K) + E, where E is an effective divisor not\ncontaining \u03c0 \u2217 (K) and m \u2208 Z is such that\n(1)\n\nm \u2265 \u2212R * j \u2217 (D) = \u221211a + 78b0 \u2212 b10 > 0.\n\nNote that we have the standard formulas j \u2217 (\u03bb) = \u03bb, j \u2217 (\u03b40 ) = \u03b40 and j \u2217 (\u03b410 ) = \u2212\u03c8 (cf. [AC]),\nwhile K \u2261 7\u03bb \u2212 \u03b40 \u2212 * * * , hence\nE \u2261 (a \u2212 7m)\u03bb + b10 \u03c8 + (m \u2212 b0 )\u03b40 + (other boundaries)\nis an effective class on M10,1 . By applying Corollary 2.5 it follows that \u03c0\u2217 (W *E) is an effective\nclass on M10 . An easy calculation using Lemma 2.3 shows that\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03c0\u2217 (W * E) \u2261 642b10 + 990(a \u2212 7m) \u03bb \u2212 55 b10 + 18(b0 \u2212 m) \u03b40 \u2212 * * * .\n\n\fEFFECTIVE DIVISORS ON Mg\n\n5\n\nWe now use that for every effective divisor on Mg the coefficient a of \u03bb is nonnegative 1.\nFrom the previous formula we get an inequality which combined with (1) yields, after a simple\ncomputation\nb10 \u2265 (71.3866...) * b0 \u2212 (10.1980...) * a.\n\u0003\nQuestion 2.6. Do we always have the inequality b10 \u2265 78b0 \u2212 11a?\nWe conclude with some examples where these inequalities can be checked directly and\nare sometimes sharp.\nExample 2.7. When g + 1 is composite, if r, d > 0 are such that g + 1 = (r + 1)(g \u2212 d + r),\nthen the locus of curves of genus g carrying a grd is a divisor with class (cf. [EH], Theorem 1):\nd\n\nMg,r \u2261 c (g + 3)\u03bb \u2212\n\n[g/2]\nX\n\u0001\ng+1\n\u03b40 \u2212\ni(g \u2212 i)\u03b4i ,\n6\ni=1\n\nwhere c is a constant depending on g, r and d. A simple calculation shows that the inequalities\nin Theorem 1.1 are satisfied. Moreover, they are sharp for i = 1 and i = 2, for any genus g.\nExample 2.8. A similar behavior is exhibited by the divisor of curves on K3 surfaces K \u2282\nM10 , where we have b1 = 5 and b2 = 9 which again gives equality in the first two inequalities\nin Theorem 1.1. Note that this follows by the method of [EH] \u00a72 if we show that the pull-back\nof K to M2,1 is supported on the Weierstrass divisor. We will obtain this in the forthcoming\npaper [FP], as a special case of a more general study of degenerations of spaces of sections of\nrank two vector bundles on curves. The same study will show a substantial difference between\nthe geometry of K and that of the Brill-Noether divisors, namely that the image of the natural\n\"flag\" map from M0,g to Mg is contained in the K3-locus for any g. Thus one cannot use the\nmethod of [EH] \u00a73 in order to determine more coefficents of K.\n3. Slopes of divisors and further remarks\nThe inequalities established in Theorem 1.1 allow us to show that, at least up to genus\n23, if the slope of an effective divisor is sufficiently small, then it is computed by the ratio a/b0 .\nProof. (of Theorem 1.4) When g is such that g+1 is composite, we have that sg \u2264 6+12/(g+1)\n(this being the slope of any Brill-Noether divisor). When g is even, one has the estimate\n2 +13g+2)\n(this being the slope of the Petri divisor, cf. [EH] Theorem 2). It follows\nsg \u2264 2(3gg(g+2)\nthat for any g \u2264 23 there exists a positive number \u01ebg such that\ns g + \u01ebg \u2264 6 +\n\n11\nfor all i \u2264 [g/2](\u2264 11).\ni+1\n\nAssume first that 2 \u2264 i \u2264 9 or i = 11. Then by Theorem 1.1(a) we know that bi \u2265\n11\n(6i+18)b0 \u2212(i+1)a, and so certainly bi \u2265 b0 if s(D) \u2264 6+ i+1\n. For i = 10 we apply 1.1(b): if the\ninequality b10 \u2265 78b0 \u2212 11a holds, then the argument is identical. If not, we have the inequality\n1For the reader's convenience we recall that this follows immediately from the fact that B * \u03bb > 0 for any\n\ncurve B \u2282 Mg such that B \u2229 Mg 6= \u2205, while there is always a complete curve in Mg passing through a general\npoint.\n\n\f6\n\nG. FARKAS and M. POPA\n\nb10 \u2265 (71.3866...) * b0 \u2212 (10.1980...) * a. Thus b10 \u2265 b0 as soon as the inequality a/b0 \u2264 6.9 is\nsatisfied. But for g \u2265 20 the inequality sg < 6.9 holds, based on the same estimates as above.\nFor i = 1, the condition is even weaker because of the formula b1 \u2265 12b0 \u2212 a in 1.1(c). Thus\nthe slope of D is computed by a/b0 .\n\u0003\nRemark 3.1. Let us consider again the curve B \u2282 Mg corresponding to a Lefschetz pencil of\ncurves of genus g on a general K3 surface (cf. Lemma 2.1). Since B * \u03b40 /B * \u03bb = 6 + 12/(g + 1)\nwhich is the conjectured value of sg , it follows that the nefness 2 of B would be a sufficient\ncondition for the Slope Conjecture to hold in genus g. Moreover, Theorem 1.4 and Corollary\n1.2 imply that for g \u2264 23 the Slope Conjecture in genus g is equivalent to B being a nef curve.\nThe conjecture fails for g = 10 because B * K = \u22121.\nRemark 3.2. An amusing consequence of Proposition 2.5 is that the Kodaira dimension\nof the universal curve Mg,1 is \u2212\u221e for all g \u2264 15, with g 6= 13, 14 ( of course this can\nbe proved directly when g \u2264 11). Indeed, if we assume that the canonical class KMg,1 \u2261\nP\n13\u03bb + \u03c8 \u2212 3(\u03b41 + \u03b4g\u22121 ) \u2212 2 g\u22122\ni=2 \u03b4i is effective on Mg,1 , then by Proposition 2.5 the class\n3 +6g 2 \u22129g+2)\nD := \u03c0\u2217 (KMg,1 * W) is effective on Mg . It turns out that s(D) = 2(13g\ng(g+1)(4g+3) , and from\nthe definition of the slope of Mg we have that s(D) \u2265 sg . But this contradicts the estimates\non sg from [Ta] and [CR].\nReferences\n[AC]\n\nE. Arbarello and M.
