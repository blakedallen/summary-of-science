During the past half-century, the electronic structure of UO2 has\nbeen thoroughly characterized by various experiments1\u201312 (for a recent review, see Ref. 13).\nUO2 is a semiconductor with a 2 eV band gap1 and localized 5f 2 -electrons that retain strong\natomic-like properties. Due to significant Coulomb interactions and spin-orbit (SO) effects,\nthe ground state of a free U4+ ion is the 3 H4 nonet [see Fig. 1(a)]. When the crystal-field\n(CF) of UO2 's fluorite structure is considered, 3 H4 is split into the ground state \u03935 triplet and\nthe excited \u03933 doublet, \u03934 triplet, and \u03931 singlet, all approximately 0.15 eV above \u03935 6,9 [see\nFig. 1(b)]. When cooled below TN = 30.8 K, UO2 undergoes a first-order phase transition\nfrom a paramagnetic to a transverse type-I antiferromagnetic (AF) phase2 , which exhibits\na Jahn-Teller (JT) distortion of the oxygen cage5 . Experimental studies now converge on\nthe view that the non-collinear magnetic structure and the oxygen distortion are of the 3-k\ntype7,9\u201311 , i.e., the moment and lattice distortion are both along the h111i direction [see\nFig. 1(c)], instead of the previously proposed 1-k (h001i)14 and 2-k (h110i)5 structures.\n\na)\n\n1\n\n.\n.\n.\n3\n\nb)\n\nS0\n\nU\nO\n~ 5 eV\n\n\ufffd3,4,1\nz\n\n~ 0.15 eV\n\nH4\n\nfree U \ufffd5f \ufffdion\n4\ufffd\n\nc)\n\n2\n\ny\n\n\ufffd5\n\nx\n\ncubic crystal field\n\n3-k\ncoupling with whole lattice\n\nFIG. 1.

Recent CF calculations have obtained quantitative agreement\n2\n\n\fwith experimental excitation spectra by fitting model parameters to the measured data16 ,\nby adding corrections to the point charge model17 , or by extrapolating from the fitted values\nfor other actinide dioxides18 . Models of magnetism in UO2 , pioneered by the work of Allen14 ,\nhave explored the delicate interplay between multipolar and Jahn-Teller effects13 .\nFirst-principles calculations have to go beyond the local-density or generalized-gradient\napproximations (LDA/GGA) to the density-functional theory (DFT) to correctly reproduce\nthe insulating character of UO2 . Existence of an energy gap was demonstrated in Ref. 19\nand 20 using the hybrid functional method21 , in Ref. 22 using the self-interaction-corrected\nLDA23 , and in Ref. 24 using the DFT+U method25 . CF splitting in actinide compounds has\nbeen computed by using constrained f states without full self-consistency26 or by analyzing\nband positions obtained from LDA/GGA calculations27 . The 3-k structure of UO2 was\nstudied by Laskowski et al. using DFT+U 28 , but their results showed anomalous dependence\non the U parameter and both the calculated oxygen distortions and energy differences were\nabout an order of magnitude too large. Furthermore, the 3-k state was only stable with\nlarge U values and a formulation of DFT+U that is usually only applied to metals. A\nfirst-principles framework for self-consistently and accurately accounting for all the different\nenergy scales in Fig. 1 does not yet exist.\nIn this paper, we present a unified DFT-based framework for calculating the electronic\nspectra, magnetism and lattice distortions in UO2 . Explicit f -f interactions and CF effects are treated using a model Hamiltonian with parameters derived from self-consistent\nDFT+U calculations. The ground state wave functions that are obtained by diagonalizing\nthis Hamiltonian are used to set up initial conditions for self-consistent DFT+U calculations\nof magnetism and lattice relaxations. Our approach allows us to accurately reproduce all\nthe different energy scales in Fig. 1, including the \u03935 ground state, \u03933,4,1 excited states, as\nwell as the energetics of competing magnetic structures, including 3-k, and their associated\nlattice distortions, all within a unified self-consistent framework.\nBefore moving on to the details, we would like to stress that extra care should be taken\nin first-principles calculations of f electrons. Several challenges are encountered in DFT\ncalculations of UO2 (and other actinide compounds in general). First, strong f -f interactions and a weak crystal field result in an inherently complicated many-body problem.\nFor instance, since 5f 2 electrons hybridize weakly with the O 2p bands and remain well\nlocalized, their true wavefunctions are in general multi-determinantal (see below for further\n3\n\n\fdiscussions). Second, the higly localized nature of f electrons tends to magnify the inaccuracies of approximate exchange-correlation functionals. We have previously shown that the\nself-interaction (SI) error of f -electrons is highly sensitive to the occupied orbital, and its\nremoval is non-trivial in both the DFT+U and hybrid-functional methods29 . Therefore, an\nimproved version of DFT+U 29 is required to remove such errors (\u223c 0.1 eV) and access weak\nCF effects. Third, the existence of a multitude of f-states often leaves DFT+U calculations\ntrapped in local minima, leading to difficulties in reproducibly finding the correct electronic\nground state. As a consequence, it is not uncommon for different authors to find inconsistent\nand hard-to-interpret results with large errors (\u223c 1 eV or even larger) even when using identical electronic-structure methods (see Refs. 29\u201336. and references therein). It is likely that\nthis issue contributed to the failure of previous studies to reliably examine the 3-k structure\nof UO2 .28 Previously, we have shown that the local minima issue is also present in hybrid\nfunctional calculations29 . In this paper, we show that the multiple minima, corresponding\nto different orbital states, contain valuable physical information about f -electrons that can\nbe used to help find the true ground state and excitation spectra.\n\nFIG. 2. Low energy f n eigenstates of Hamiltonian 2 a) n = 1: \u03938 ground states and \u03937 doublet of\nthe j = 5/2 sextet b) n = 2: \u03935 ground states and the excited \u03933,4,1 of 3 H4\n\nII.\n\nMETHOD\nA.\n\nLDA+U calculations\n\nAll DFT calculations were carried out using the VASP code37 , GGA-PAW potentials38 , a\ncutoff energy of 450 eV, and without any symmetry constraints to allow symmetry-breaking\nsolutions. Crystal field calculations were performed in the primitive cell of one UO2 formula\n4\n\n\funit with a 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6 k-point grid. The lattice and ionic positions were frozen at the\nexperimental fluorite structure for crystal field calculations. These calculations, as discussed\nin sectionIII A, are ferromagnetic with one uranium ion per cell. Magnetic structures were\ncalculated in the fcc supercell (4 formula units) using a 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 grid, first without and\nthen with full relaxation. Spin-orbit coupling was self-consistently incorporated for realistic\ncomparison with experiment.\nTo remove the orbital-dependent components of self-interaction errors (SIE) of f electrons, we use a formulation of the LDA+U method29 by modifying only the exchange\nterm, rather than both Hartree and exchange, of the LDA:\n\nE LDA+U = E LDA + EX \u2212 EdcX ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the orbital-dependent Hartree-Fock exchange EX contains a term that approximately\ncancels the on-site SIE in the Hartree energy of localized f -electrons; the remainder of the\nLDA Hartree energy is exact by definition and therefore left unmodified in our approach.\nThe exchange double-counting term EdcX accounts for the LDA exchange energy and is given\nby a linear combination controlled by the c parameter of the exchange double-counting in\nthe Liechtenstein39 scheme and the on-site local-spin-density (LSD) exchange, conceptually\nsimilar to hybrid functional approaches and serves the purpose of subtracting the orbitaldependence of the LDA exchange energy. As a result, eq. 1 is self-interaction free to high\naccuracy.\nThere is only one adjustable parameter, U , in our approach, and the other parameters\nJ and c can be determined at given U . As done in Ref. 29, we choose up to seven f 2 SSD\nstates of the U4+ ion that are analytically degenerate without considering spin-orbit, and\ncalculate these states' total energy dependence on J and c. As shown in Fig. 3, optimal\nvalues of J=0.6 eV and c = 0.5 are obtained at U =6 eV that minimize the energy difference,\ni.e. the orbital-dependent self-interaction error. These J and c values are used throughout\nthe paper. We use U =6 eV in this paper and discuss the dependence of the results on U in\nsection III B.

For different magnetization directions B, the ground states \u03938 quartet (f 1 ) and \u03935\ntriplet (f 2 ), their spin and total magnetic moment in \u03bcB , and, for f 2 , the dominant determinants\nin the corresponding f 1 basis.\n\nWe first discuss the general properties of solutions to Eqs. (2)-(4) using the model parameters derived from DFT+U calculations (which will be discussed in detail in section III A).\n7\n\n\fFor n = 1, 14 eigenstates are obtained, the lowest being the \u03938 quartet (Fig. 2 and Table I).\nFor n > 1, the Hamiltonian in Eq. (2) can be diagonalized via configuration interaction of\nCn14 f n single Slater determinants (SSD) based on the f 1 eigenstates. The \u03935 ground states\nof f 2 are shown in Table I, together with their dominant determinants, designated as (i, j)\nusing the indices of f 1 states in the left column of Table I. For magnetic moment along each\nof the [001], [110], and [111] directions, the \u03938 quartet of f 1 includes states 1,4 (2,3) with\nlarger (smaller) spin and orbital magnetic momenta, while the \u03935 triplet of f 2 consists of\nstates a and c with |\u03bc| = 2.06 \u03bcB and one dominant determinant [(1, 2) or (3, 4)], as well as\na non-magnetic state b dominated by two determinants (right column of Table I). Note that\nthe observed moment of the ordered state is smaller at 1.75 \u03bcB 5 . The moment \u03bc = 2.06\u03bcB of\nthe \u03935 (a, c) states is slightly larger than the saturated 2\u03bcB characteristic of the 3 H4 multiplet\nbecause exchange and SOC interactions are all of comparable strength and other multiplets\nslightly mix into the ground state and increase the effective moment15 . In general, all the\nf 2 eigenstates, including \u03933,4,1 (Fig. 2) are composed of multiple determinants.\n\nC.\n\nModel parameters from LDA+U\n\nThe parameters for the model Hamiltonian in Eq. (2) are obtained by analyzing the\ntotal energies and f wavefunctions calculated with LDA+U . In this procedure, many selfconsistent LDA+U calculations are first carried out, yielding solutions that are in general\nlocal minima rather than the global minimum of UO2 . Next, we extract the f 2 Kohn-Sham\nwavefunction |\u03a8f i, SSD by construction, from each solution, and compute the expected\nenergy according to Eq. (2)\nh\u03a8f |H0 |\u03a8f i = x1 V4 + x2 V6 + x3 \u03b6 + x4 F 2 + U,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere xi 's represent the solution-dependent coefficient associated with model parameters. Since the F k (k = 2, 4, 6) contributions of V\u0302ee are heavily correlated42 , the following\napproximation43 has been adopted in Eq. (5):\nF 2 = F 4 /0.668 = F 6 /0.494,\n\n(6)\n\neliminating model parameters F 4 and F 6 . Finally, expectation values of H (Eq. 5) of\nthe obtained solutions are fitted to the corresponding DFT+U total energies, yielding selfconsistent ab initio values of F 2 , \u03b6 and the crystal field parameters V4 and V6 . We use the\n8\n\n\fsimple least-square method to perform the linear fitting. Here U in eq. (5) can be regarded\nas a constant in the fitting and bears no direct physical meaning.\n\nIII.\nA.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\nCrystal field ground states and excitations\n\nWe carried out a series of 50 different self-consistent calculations with randomly initialized\nf 2 states. Due to the existence of multiple local minima in DFT+U , these calculations\nresulted in a range of energies spread over almost 2 eV [filled circles in Fig. 4(a)]. It is seen\nthat random wavefunction initialization has generated only one low-energy solution, while\nthe remaining runs were trapped in metastable high-energy states.\nae\n\naL\n\nG1\nG4\n\nae ae\naeae\nae\nae\nae\nae\nae\naeaeae\naeaeaeae\n1\nae\nae\nae\nae\naeaeae\nae\naeae\naeaeaeae\naeae\nae\nae\naeae\n\u00e7\u00e7\nae\n\u00e7\nae\n\n\u00e7 SSD from f\n\n1.0\n\n0.15\n\nG3\n\nE @eVD\n\nEHfittedL @eVD\n\n0.20 bL\n\nae random SSD\n\n1.5\n\nOut[42]=\n\naeae\n\n0.10\n\n\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\n0.5\n\u00e7\n\n0.0\n\nae\n\u00e7\n\n0.0\n\nRMS=35 meV\n\n\u00e7\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\n0.05\n\nH1,2L\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\nEHDFT+UL @eVD\n\n2.0\n\n0.00\n\nG5\nU=6 U=4.5 Expt\n\nFIG. 4. a) Fitting of DFT+U 29 energy to Eq. 2 for 50 runs with random initial states (filled circles)\nand 15 states with initial states constructed from f 1 solutions (open circles). b) Predicted f 2 CF\nlevels \u03935,3,4,1 compared to measured CF splitting9 .\n\nObtained from the fitting procedure outlined in section II C, model parameters are applied in Eq. (2) to construct f 1 eigenstates and subsequently determine f 2 states by direct\ndiagonalization within the subspace of SSDs formed from f 1 eigenstates. To further improve\nthe quality of our fit and provide data points in the low-energy region that was poorly rep9\n\n\fresented in the randomly initialized sample [filled circles in Fig. 4(a)], we self-consistently\ncalculate the DFT+U energies of additional 15 two-electron SSD states that involve the 6\nlow energy f 1 orbitals (\u03938 and \u03937 ) for B//[001]; these points are shown as open circles in\nFig. 4a. The (1, 2) and (3, 4) states, which dominate the \u03935a and \u03935c ground states, are\nalso found to have the lowest energies in self-consistent DFT+U calculations, demonstrating that our method can reliably locate the electronic ground state. The other ground state\nin Table I, \u03935b , has two dominant determinants and is not directly accessible in DFT+U .\nTherefore, the data flow between the model Hamiltonian and DFT+U calculations is bidirectional: DFT+U provides model parameters, while the model guides the DFT+U to\nthe ground state and gives access to multi-determinant states.\nF2\n\nF4\n\nF6\n\n\u03b6\n\nV4\n\nV6\n\nU = 6 eV\n\n5.649\n\n(3.773)\n\n(2.790)\n\n0.230\n\n-0.093\n\n0.0157\n\nU = 4.5 eV\n\n5.495\n\n(3.670)\n\n(2.714)\n\n0.209\n\n-0.106\n\n0.0163\n\nU4+ ion44\n\n6.439\n\n5.295\n\n3.440\n\n0.244\n-0.112\n\n0.024\n\nRef.9\n\n-0.123\n\n0.0265\n\nRef.18\n\n-0.155\n\n0.0333\n\nRef.16\n\nusing ref.44\n\nTABLE II. Fitted parameters (in eV) using Eqs. (2), (3), and (6), compared with prior studies.\n\nThe final fitted parameters are shown in Table II. Compared to the values obtained by\nfitting the spectra of free ions44 , the ionic parameters F k and \u03b6 in the UO2 solid are somewhat\nsuppressed due to hybridization and screening effects. The calculated cubic CF parameters\nV4 and V6 are slightly smaller than those fitted to experimental data or extrapolated from\nother actinide oxides9,16,18 . The Hamiltonian in Eq. (2) can now be diagonalized. The\npredicted energies of the three lowest excited CF levels \u03933,4,1 are in reasonable agreement\nwith experiment9 with errors of approximately 10-20 meV [Fig. 4(b)]. A notable deviation\nis overestimation of the splitting between these levels.\nFinally, we note that the input J = 0.6 eV used in our DFT+U calculation differs from\nthe fitted value of J 0 = (286F 2 + 195F 4 + 250F 6 )/6435 in Table II. This is because the\nrole of the former is to minimize the SI error in DFT+U , while the latter represents on-site\n10\n\n\fexchange, and some difference between them is expected when used with an approximate xc\nfunctional. A perfect xc functional would make the input U or J unnecessary and predict\nphysically meaningful output J 0 or F k .\n\nB.\n\nDependence on input U\n\nTo illustrate the effect of the only adjustable variable in our approach, U , the same\ncalculations were repeated using U = 4.5 eV. As shown in Table II and Fig. 4(b), the results\nchange only slightly and remain in good agreement with experiment. Note that when U ,\nwhich controls the degree of electron localization, is decreased, the ionic parameters F k\nand \u03b6 also decrease, i.e. away from the free ion values, while the CF parameters increase,\nsuggesting that the f -electrons become more delocalized. Such a picture of opposite influence\nof electron localization on free ion and CF parameters is consistent with the observed trend\nthat increase of the CF interaction results in a reduction in the free-ion parameters for the\nsame ion in different chemical environment45 .\n\nC.\n\nMagnetic properties\n\nFinally, we discuss the effects of inter-ionic interactions and magnetic properties of UO2 .\nVarious magnetic structures within a cubic supercell of four formula units were calculated,\nfirst without and then with lattice relaxation. The previous approximation of representing\nthe \u03935 ground state with the (1, 2), (3, 4) SSDs was adopted. Table III shows the energies\nEs (static lattice), Er (after full relaxation), and the total magnetic moments \u03bc assuming\nferromagnetic (FM) and type-A anti-ferromagnetic (AAF) configurations along the [001]\n(reference), [110], and [111] directions. In all cases, the calculated \u03bc of \u223c 2.1\u20132.2 \u03bcB is\nclose to the saturated value 2.06 \u03bcB in Table I and larger than the measured 1.74 \u03bcB 2 . The\nreduction of the ordered moment is a topic of considerable interest, but the mechanisms,\nsuch as the dynamical Jahn-Teller effect46 , are beyond the scope of this work. Given that\nthe (1, 2)/(3, 4) states are the CF ground states within our computational approach and\nthe calculated moment is not too far from 1.74 \u03bcB , we continue to use these settings for\nnon-collinear magnetic calculations.\nTable III shows that for each magnetization direction, the AAF configuration is always\n11\n\n\flower than the FM configuration, in agreement with experiment. The energy differences\nEs (FM) \u2212 Es (AAF) are in the 4-6 meV range, suggesting that multipolar interactions and\nanisotropy are weak. These weak, mostly isotropic interactions underlie the success of the\nsimple fitting procedure of Section II C (root-mean-square error = 35 meV) in FM configurations of 15 h001i solutions and 50 solutions with random magnetic moment directions.\nWe also find that the different magnetization directions differ in energy by less than 9 meV,\nsuggesting that our procedure for removing the orbital-depedent SI error is highly accurate.\nIndeed, the f 2 wavefunctions differ considerably for the three principle directions (see Table\nI), which would result in SI errors of 0.1 \u223c 0.2 eV using the unmodified DFT+U approach.\nNevertheless, we take additional care to remove any remaining SI errors, however small they\nthey appear to be, by subtracting a reference energy Ed for each principle magnetization\ndirection d = h001i, h110i, or h111i: Ed = [Es (FM) + Es (AAF)]/2. With this correction, the\nAAF configurations in the three directions, as well as the 3-k structure (magnetic moment\nalong h111i, see Fig. 1c), are essentially degenerate before lattice relaxation.\nThe magnetic transition temperature of antiferromagnetic UO2 is estimated with a classical Heisenberg model on an fcc lattice:\nH = \u2212JH\n\nX\n\n~si * ~sj ,\n\n(7)\n\nhiji\n\nwhere the summation is over all nearest neighbor sites hiji with unit spin ~s. The FM/AAF\nenergy difference per UO2 is \u2206E = 6JH \u2212 (\u22122JH ) = 8JH . As shown in Table III, \u2206E \u2248 6\nmeV, corresponding to TN = 3.18JH /kB 47 , or about 28 K, in excellent agreement with the\nexperimental value 30.8 K.2\nAfter relaxation without symmetry constraints, we obtain the energies listed in the right\ncolumn of Table III. The computed moments \u03bc become slightly larger than the static values.\nThe relaxation energy Er and the corrected Er \u2212 Ed are large (> 50 meV) due to differences\nbetween the static (fixed to experimental a = 5.47 \u00c5) and relaxed lattice parameters. The\nenergy differences between competing magnetic configurations increases to \u223c 10 meV; these\nvalues are consistent with the N\u00e9el temperature of TN = 30.8 K2 . The relaxed structures\nwith \u03bc//h111i are clearly more stable than h001i and h110i. We have enumerated all AF\nh111i structures within the fcc unit cell and found that the 3-k structure indeed has the\nlowest energy. The associated oxygen lattice distortion (amplitude 0.024 \u00c5) is also of the\n3-k type, though slightly larger than the measured 0.014 \u00c55 .\n12\n\n\fstatic\n\nrelaxed\n\nEs\n\nEs \u2212 Ed\n\n|\u03bc|/\u03bcB\n\nEr\n\nEr \u2212 Ed\n\n|\u03bc|/\u03bcB\n\n[001] FM\n\n0 (ref)\n\n3.3\n\n2.11\n\n-57.3\n\n-54.0\n\n2.20\n\n[001] AAF\n\n-6.5\n\n-3.3\n\n2.11\n\n-61.9\n\n-58.6\n\n2.35\n\n[110] FM\n\n-8.2\n\n2.1\n\n2.15\n\n-65.5\n\n-55.2\n\n2.33\n\n[110] AAF\n\n-12.4\n\n-2.1\n\n2.15\n\n-71.8\n\n-61.5\n\n2.22\n\n[111] FM\n\n-8.5\n\n2.4\n\n2.22\n\n-70.3\n\n-59.5\n\n2.22\n\n[111] AAF\n\n-13.2\n\n-2.4\n\n2.21\n\n-76.3\n\n-65.5\n\n2.27\n\n3-k\n\n-13.8\n\n-3.0\n\n2.21\n\n-81.1\n\n-70.3\n\n2.39\n\nconfig.\n\nTABLE III. Energy (in meV per UO2 ) for different magnetic structures, without and with ionic\nrelaxation.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn summary, we have studied the electronic structure of UO2 using an aspherical-selfinteraction free DFT+U method coupled with a model Hamiltonian. The \u03935 crystal field\nground states, as well as the CF excitation energies are reproduced in good agreement with\nexperiment. Various magnetic structures are investigated with careful initialization of the\norbital and magnetic states. The inter-ionic interactions are found to be weak and largely\nisotropic. When self-interaction errors are accounted for, the 3-k structure is essentially\ndegenerate with other antiferromagnetic configurations and becomes the ground state only\nwhen lattice relaxations are considered. Our work demonstrates the usefulness of electronic\nstructure calculations for f -compounds with proper treatment of self-interaction errors and\nmultiple self-consistent local minima corresponding to different orbital states; this approach\ncan be readily applied to defect supercells and other f -compounds.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Nuclear Energy Research\nInitiative Consortium (NERI-C) under grant No. DE-FG07-07ID14893, and used resources\n13\n\n\fof the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC).\n\n1\n\nJ.
