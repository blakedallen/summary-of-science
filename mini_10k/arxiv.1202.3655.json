Weak Galerkin (WG) refers to a finite element technique for\npartial differential equations in which differential operators are approximated by their\nweak forms as distributions. In [29], a weak Galerkin method was introduced and\nanalyzed for second order elliptic equations based on weak gradients. In this paper,\nwe shall develop a new weak Galerkin method for second order elliptic equations\nformulated as a system of two first order linear equations. Our model problem seeks\na flux function q = q(x) and a scalar function u = u(x) defined in an open bounded\npolygonal or polyhedral domain \u03a9 \u2282 Rd (d = 2, 3) satisfying\n(1.1)\n\n\u03b1q + \u2207u = 0, \u2207 * q = f,\n\nin \u03a9\n\nand the following Dirichlet boundary condition\n(1.2)\n\nu = \u2212g\n\non \u2202\u03a9,\n\n2\n\nwhere \u03b1 = (\u03b1ij (x))d\u00d7d \u2208 [L\u221e (\u03a9)]d is a symmetric, uniformly positive definite matrix\non the domain \u03a9. A weak formulation for (1.1)-(1.2) seeks q \u2208 H(div, \u03a9) and u \u2208\nL2 (\u03a9) such that\n(1.3)\n(1.4)\n\n(\u03b1q, v) \u2212 (\u2207 * v, u) = hg, v * ni\u2202\u03a9 , \u2200v \u2208 H(div, \u03a9)\n(\u2207 * q, w) = (f, w), \u2200w \u2208 L2 (\u03a9).\n\nHere L2 (\u03a9) is the standard space of square integrable functions on \u03a9, \u2207 * v is the\ndivergence of vector-valued functions v on \u03a9, H(div, \u03a9) is the Sobolev space consisting\nof vector-valued functions v such that v \u2208 [L2 (\u03a9)]d and \u2207 * v \u2208 L2 (\u03a9), (*, *) stands\nfor the L2 -inner product in L2 (\u03a9), and h*, *i\u2202\u03a9 is the inner product in L2 (\u2202\u03a9).\n\u2217 Division of Mathematical Sciences, National Science Foundation, Arlington, VA 22230 (jwang@\nnsf.gov).

This research was supported in part by National Science Foundation Grant DMS1115097.\n\n1\n\n\f2\nGalerkin methods based on the weak formulation (1.3)-(1.4) and finite dimensional subspaces of H(div, \u03a9) \u00d7 L2 (\u03a9) with piecewise polynomials are known as mixed\nfinite element methods (MFEM). MFEMs for (1.1)-(1.2) treat q and u as unknown\nfunctions and are capable of providing accurate approximations for both unknowns\n[1, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 27, 28]. All the existing MFEMs in literature possess local mass\nconservation that makes MFEM a competitive numerical technique in many applications such as oil reservoir and groundwater flow simulation in porous media. On the\nother hand, MFEMs are formulated in subspaces of H(div, \u03a9) \u00d7 L2 (\u03a9) which requires\na certain continuity of the finite element functions for the flux variable. More precisely, the flux functions must be sufficiently continuous so that the usual divergence\nis well-defined in the classical sense in L2 (\u03a9). This continuity assumption in turn\nimposes a strong restriction on the structure of the finite element partition and the\npiecewise polynomials defined on them [27, 11, 9, 10].\nThe weak Galerkin method introduced in [29] (see also [23, 22] for extensions)\nwas based on a use of weak gradients in the following variational formulation: find\nu \u2208 H 1 (\u03a9) such that u = \u2212g on \u2202\u03a9 and\n(1.5)\n\n(\u03b1\u22121 \u2207u, \u2207\u03c6) = (f, \u03c6),\n\n\u2200\u03c6 \u2208 H01 (\u03a9),\n\nwhere H 1 (\u03a9) is the Sobolev space consisting of functions for which all partial derivatives up to order one are square integrable, H01 (\u03a9) is the subspace of H 1 (\u03a9) consisting\nof functions with vanishing value on \u2202\u03a9. Specifically, the weak Galerkin finite element\nformulation in [29, 23, 22] can be obtained from (1.5) by simply replacing the gradient\n\u2207 by a discrete gradient \u2207w (it was denoted as \u2207d in [29]) defined by a distributional\nformula. The discrete gradient operator \u2207w is locally-defined on each element. It has\nbeen demonstrated [29, 24, 25, 26] that the weak Galerkin method enjoys an easy-toimplement formulation that is parameter free and inherits the physical property of\nmass conservation locally on each element. Furthermore, the weak Galerkin method\nhas the flexibility of using discontinuous finite element functions, as was commonly\nemployed in discontinuous Galerkin and hybridized discontinuous Galerkin methods\n[2, 15].\nThe goal of this paper is to extend the weak Galerkin method of [29, 23, 22]\nto the variational formulation (1.3)-(1.4) by following the idea of weak gradients. It\nis clear that divergence is the principle differential operator in (1.3)-(1.4). Thus,\nan essential part of the extension is the development of a weakly-defined discrete\ndivergence operator, denoted by (\u2207w *), for a class of vector-valued weak functions in\na finite element setting. Assuming that there is such a discrete divergence operator\n(\u2207w *) defined on a finite element space Vh for the flux variable q, then formally one\nwould have a WG method for (1.1)-(1.2) that seeks qh \u2208 Vh and uh \u2208 Wh satisfying\n(\u03b1qh , v) \u2212 (\u2207w * v, uh ) = hg, v * ni\u2202\u03a9 , \u2200v \u2208 Vh\n(\u2207w * qh , w) = (f, w), \u2200w \u2208 Wh ,\nwhere Wh is a properly defined finite element space for the scalar variable. The rest\nof the paper will provide details for a rigorous interpretation and justification of the\nabove formal WG method, which shall be called WG-MFEM methods.\nThe WG-MFEM methods have the following features. First of all, the finite element partition of the domain \u03a9 is allowed to consist of arbitrary shape of polygons for\nd = 2 and polyhedra for d = 3. Secondly, the flux approximation space Vh consists of\ntwo components, where the first one is given by piecewise polynomials on each polygon/polyhedra and the second is given by piecewise polynomials on the edges/faces\n\n\f3\nof the polygon/polyhedra. The second component shall be used to approximate the\nnormal component of the flux variable q on each edge/face. Furthermore, the scalar\napproximation space Wh consists of piecewise polynomials on each polygon/polyhedra\nwith one degree higher than that of the flux. For example, the lowest order of such\nelements would consist of piecewise constant for flux and its normal component on\neach edge/face plus piecewise linear function for the scalar variable on each polygon/polyhedra. There is no continuity required for any of the finite element functions\nin WG-MFEM.\nOne close relative of the WG-MFEM is the mimetic finite difference (MFD)\nmethod, see [6, 12, 4, 5] and the reference cited therein. Both WG-MFEM and MFD\nshare the same flexibility of using polygonal/polyhedral elements of the domain. The\nlowest order MFD approximates the flux by using only piecewise constants on each\nedge/face, and the scalar variable by using another piecewise constant function on each\npolygonal/polyhedral element, while WG-MFEM provides a wide class of numerical\nschemes with arbitrary order of polynomials. The arbitrary-order mimetic scheme\nof [4] is based on the philosophy of approximating the forms in (1.5) using nodalbased polynomials, which has very minimal overlap with the WG-MFEM. It should\nbe pointed out that there are other numerical methods designed on general polygonal meshes in existing literature [18, 17, 2, 15, 20, 19]. In particular, a comparison\nwith existing numerical schemes should be conducted on a certain set of benchmark\nproblems as demonstrated in [20]. More benchmarks can be found in [19].\nAllowing arbitrary shape for mesh elements provides a convenient flexibility in\nboth numerical approximation and mesh generation, especially in regions where the\ndomain geometry is complex. Such a flexibility is also very much appreciated in\nadaptive mesh refinement methods. This is a highly desirable feature in practice\nsince a single type of mesh technology is too restrictive in resolving complex multidimensional and multi-scale problems efficiently [21].\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present a discussion of weak\ndivergence operator in some weakly-defined spaces. In Section 3, we provide a detailed\ndescription and assumptions for the WG-MFEM method. In Section 4, we define some\nlocal projection operators and then derive some approximation properties which are\nuseful in error analysis. In Section 5, we shall establish an optimal order error estimate\nfor the WG-MFEM approximations in a norm that is related to the L2 for the flux and\nH 1 for the scalar function. In Section 6, we derive an optimal order error estimate\nin L2 for the scalar approximation by using a duality argument as was commonly\nemployed in the standard Galerkin finite element methods [14, 7]. Finally, we provide\nsome technical results in the appendix that are critical in dealing with finite element\nfunctions on arbitrary polygons/polyhedra.\n2. Weak Divergence. The key in weak Galerkin methods is the use of weak\nderivatives in the place of strong derivatives in the variational form for the underlying\npartial differential equations. For the mixed problem (1.1) with boundary condition\n(1.2), the corresponding variational form is given by (1.3) and (1.4), where divergence\nis the only differential operator involved in the formulation. Thus, understanding\nweak divergence is critically important in the corresponding WG method. The goal\nof this section is to introduce a weak divergence operator and its approximation by\nusing piecewise polynomials.\nLet K be any polygonal or polyhedral domain with interior K 0 and boundary\n\u2202K. A weak vector-valued function on the region K refers to a vector-valued function\n1\nv = {v0 , vb } such that v0 \u2208 [L2 (K)]d and vb * n \u2208 H \u2212 2 (\u2202K), where n is the outward\n\n\f4\nnormal direction of K on its boundary. The first component v0 can be understood as\nthe value of v in the interior of K, and the second component vb represents v on the\n1\nboundary of K. The requirement of vb * n \u2208 H \u2212 2 (\u2202K) indicates that we are merely\ninterested in the normal component of vb . Note that vb may not be necessarily related\nto the trace of v0 on \u2202K should a trace be well defined. Denote by M(K) the space\nof weak vector-valued functions on K; i.e.,\n(2.1)\n\n1\n\nM(K) = {v = {v0 , vb } : v0 \u2208 [L2 (K)]d , vb * n \u2208 H \u2212 2 (\u2202K)}.\n\nFollowing the definition of weak gradient introduced in [29], we define a weak divergence operator as follows.\nDefinition 2.1. The dual of L2 (K) can be identified with itself by using the\nstandard L2 inner product as the action of linear functionals. With a similar interpretation, for any v \u2208 M(K), the weak divergence of v is defined as a linear\nfunctional \u2207w * v in the dual space of H 1 (K) whose action on each \u03c6 \u2208 H 1 (K) is\ngiven by\n(2.2)\n\n(\u2207w * v, \u03c6)K := \u2212(v0 , \u2207\u03c6)K + hvb * n, \u03c6i\u2202K ,\nR\nwhere n is the outward normal direction to \u2202K, (v0 , \u2207\u03c6)K = K v0 * \u2207\u03c6dK is the\n1\naction of v0 on \u2207\u03c6, and hvb * n, \u03c6i\u2202K is the action of vb * n on \u03c6 \u2208 H 2 (\u2202K).\nThe Sobolev space [H 1 (K)]d can be embedded into the space M(K) by an inclusion map iM : [H 1 (K)]d \u2192 M(K) defined as follows\niM (q) = {q|K , q|\u2202K }.\nWith the help of the inclusion map iM , the Sobolev space [H 1 (K)]d can be viewed\nas a subspace of M(K) by identifying each q \u2208 [H 1 (K)]d with iM (q). Analogously,\na weak vector-valued function v = {v0 , vb } \u2208 M(K) is said to be in [H 1 (K)]d if it\ncan be identified with a function q \u2208 [H 1 (K)]d through the above inclusion map. It\nis not hard to see that \u2207w * v = \u2207 * v if v is a smooth function in [H 1 (K)]d .\nNext, we introduce a discrete weak divergence operator by approximating (\u2207w * )\nin a polynomial subspace of the dual of H 1 (K). To this end, for any non-negative\ninteger r \u2265 0, denote by Pr (K) the set of polynomials on K with degree no more than\nr. A discrete weak divergence operator, denoted by (\u2207w,r *), is defined as the unique\npolynomial (\u2207w,r * v) \u2208 Pr (K) that satisfies the following equation\n(2.3)\n\n(\u2207w,r * v, \u03c6)K = \u2212(v0 , \u2207\u03c6)K + hvb * n, \u03c6i\u2202K ,\n\n\u2200\u03c6 \u2208 Pr (K).\n\n3.

We further assume that for every\nT \u2208 Th , and for every edge/face e \u2208 \u2202T , there exists a pyramid P (e, T, Ae )\ncontained in T such that its base is identical with e, its apex is Ae \u2208 T , and\nits height is proportional to hT with a proportionality constant \u03c3e bounded\naway from a fixed positive number \u03c3 \u2217 from below. In other words, the height\nof the pyramid is given by \u03c3e hT such that \u03c3e \u2265 \u03c3 \u2217 > 0. The pyramid is also\nassumed to stand up above the base e in the sense that the angle between the\nvector xe \u2212 Ae , for any xe \u2208 e, and the outward normal direction of e (i.e.,\nthe vector n in Fig. 3.1) is strictly acute by falling into an interval [0, \u03b80 ] with\n\u03b80 < \u03c02 .\nA4: Assume that each T \u2208 Th has a circumscribed simplex S(T ) that is shape\nregular and has a diameter hS(T ) proportional to the diameter of T ; i.e.,\nhS(T ) \u2264 \u03b3\u2217 hT with a constant \u03b3\u2217 independent of T . Furthermore, assume\nthat each circumscribed simplex S(T ) intersects with only a fixed and small\nnumber of such simplices for all other elements T \u2208 Th .\nFigure 3.1 depicts a polygonal element that is shape regular. Reader are referred\nto [12] for a similar, but different type of shape regularity assumption for the underlying finite element partition of the domain. The shape regularity is required for\nderiving error estimates for locally defined projection operators to be detailed in later\nsections.\n\n\f6\nRecall that, on each element T \u2208 Th , there is a space of weak vector-valued\nfunctions M(T ) defined as in (6.11). Denote by M the weak vector-valued function\nspace on Th given by\nY\n(3.3)\nM :=\nM(T ).\nT \u2208Th\n\nNote that functions in M are defined on each element, and there are two sided values\nof vb on each interior edge/face e, depicted as vb |\u2202T1 and vb |\u2202T2 in Fig. 3.2.\nD\nC\nne\n\nT2\n\nn2\n\nT1\n\nvb |\u2202T1 vb |\u2202T2\nn1\ne\n\nA\n\nB\nFig. 3.2. An interior edge shared by two elements\n\nLet V \u2282 M be a subspace of M consisting of weak vector-valued functions which\nare continuous across each interior edge/face e in the normal direction; i.e.,\n(3.4)\n\nV = {v \u2208 M : \u2203 q \u2208 H(div, \u03a9) s.t. q|\u2202T * n = (vb )\u2202T * n, \u2200T \u2208 Th } .\n\nThe weak divergence operator as defined in (2.2) can be extended to any weak vectorvalued function v \u2208 V by taking weak divergence locally on each element T . More\nprecisely, the weak divergence of any v \u2208 V is defined element-by-element as follows:\n\u2207w * v = \u2207w * (v|T ),\n\non T \u2208 Th .\n\nSimilarly, the discrete weak divergence as defined in (2.3) can be extended to V by\ndefining\n(3.5)\n\n\u2207w,r * v = \u2207w,r * (v|T ),\n\non T \u2208 Th .\n\nThe definition of weak divergence of v = {v0 , vb } \u2208 V requires the value of v on\neach element T , namely v0 , and the normal component of vb on each edge or face\ne \u2208 Eh . Thus, it is the normal component of v on each e \u2208 Eh that really enters into\nthe equation of discussion in numerical methods. For convenience, we introduce a set\nof normal directions on Eh as follows\n(3.6)\n\nDh = {ne : ne is unit and normal to e, e \u2208 Eh }.\n\nFigure 3.2 shows one example of ne pointing from the element T1 to T2 . In the\nrest of this paper, we will be concerned with a subspace of V in which the second\n\n\f7\ncomponent of v = {v0 , vb } represents the normal component of v on each e \u2208 Eh ; i.e.,\n(vb )|e = (v|e * ne )ne .\nA discrete weak vector-valued function v = {v0 , vb } refers to weak vector-valued\nfunctions in which both v0 and vb are vector-valued polynomials. Since the second\ncomponent is represented as vb = vb ne where ne is the prescribed normal direction\nto e \u2208 Eh , then vb is required to be a polynomial on each edge or flat face of \u2202T .\nRecall that, for each element T \u2208 Th , Pk (T ) denotes the set of polynomials on T with\ndegree no more than k \u2265 0 and Pl (e) is the set of polynomials on e \u2208 Eh with degree\nno more than l \u2265 0.\nWe now introduce two finite element spaces which are necessary for formulating\nour numerical schemes. The first one corresponds to the scalar (or pressure) variable\ndefined as follows\nWh = {w \u2208 L2 (\u03a9); w|T \u2208 Pk+1 (T )},\nwhere k \u2265 0 is a non-negative integer. The second one corresponds to vector-valued\nfunctions and their normal components on the set Eh of edges or flat faces, and is\ngiven by\n(3.7)\n\n\b\nVh = v = {v0 , vb } : v0 |T \u2208 [Pk (T )]d , vb |e = vb ne , vb \u2208 Pk (e), e \u2208 Eh .\n\nThe pair Vh \u00d7 Wh forms a finite element approximation space for the unknowns q\nand u of the problem (1.3)-(1.4). For simplicity of notation and discussion, we shall\nrefer the above defined finite element spaces as ([Pk (T )]d , Pk (e), Pk+1 (T )) element.\nThe lowest order of such element makes use of piecewise constant for the flux variable\non each element T and its edges/faces and piecewise linear for the pressure (scalar)\nvariable.\nThe discrete weak divergence (\u2207w,k+1 *) as defined in (3.5) and (2.3) then provides\na linear map from the finite element space Vh to Wh . In particular, for any v \u2208 Vh\nand w \u2208 Wh , we have the following relation\n(\u2207w,k+1 * v, w) : =\n\nX\n\n(\u2207w,k+1 * v, w)T\n\nT \u2208Th\n\n(3.8)\n\n=\n\nX \u0012Z\n\nT \u2208Th\n\n\u2202T\n\n(vb * n)wds \u2212\n\nZ\n\nT\n\nv0 * (\u2207w)dT\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\nWith an abuse of notation, we shall use (\u2207w *) to denote the discrete weak divergence\noperator (\u2207w,k+1 *) in the rest of this paper.\nWith the discrete divergence given by (3.8), one might naively formulate a finite\nelement method by using (1.3) and (1.4) as follows. Find qh = {q0 , qb } \u2208 Vh and\nuh \u2208 Wh such that\n(3.9)\n(3.10)\n\n(\u03b1q0 , v0 ) \u2212 (\u2207w * v, uh ) = hg, vb * ni\u2202\u03a9 , \u2200v = {v0 , vb } \u2208 Vh\n(\u2207w * qh , w) = (f, w), \u2200w \u2208 Wh .\n\nUnfortunately, due to an insufficient enforcement on the component qb , the resulting\nsystem of linear equations from (3.9)-(3.10) generally does not have a unique solution.\nOne remedy to this problem is to stabilize the bilinear form (\u03b1q0 , v0 ) by requiring\nsome communication between q0 and qb . To this end, we introduce three bilinear\n\n\f8\nforms as follows.\n(3.11)\n(3.12)\n(3.13)\n\na(\u03b7, v) = (\u03b1\u03b7 0 , v0 ),\n\u03b7, v \u2208 Vh ,\nb(\u03b7, w) = (\u2207w * \u03b7, w),\n\u03b7 \u2208 V h , w \u2208 Wh ,\nX\nhT h(\u03b7 0 \u2212 \u03b7 b ) * n, (v0 \u2212 vb ) * ni\u2202T ,\ns(\u03b7, v) = \u03c1\n\n\u03b7, v \u2208 Vh ,\n\nT \u2208Th\n\nand a stabilized bilinear form as (*, *):\nas (\u03b7, v) := a(\u03b7, v) + s(\u03b7, v).\nHere \u03c1 > 0 is any parameter and hT is the size of T . In practical computation, one\nmight chose \u03c1 = 1 and substitute hT by the mesh size h for quasi-uniform partitions;\ni.e., partitions for which hT /h is bounded from below and above uniformly in T .\nWeak Galerkin MFEM Algorithm 1. Let Th be a shape regular finite element partition of \u03a9 and Vh \u00d7 Wh be the corresponding finite element spaces consisting\nof ([Pk (T )]d , Pk (e), Pk+1 (T )) elements with k \u2265 0. An approximation for (1.1)-(1.2)\nis given by seeking qh = {q0 , qb } \u2208 Vh and uh \u2208 Wh such that\n(3.14)\n(3.15)\n\nas (qh , v) \u2212 b(v, uh ) = hg, vb * ni\u2202\u03a9 ,\nb(qh , w) = (f, w),\n\nfor any v = {v0 , vb } \u2208 Vh and w \u2208 Wh . The pair of solutions (qh ; uh ) is called a\nweak Galerkin mixed finite element approximation of (1.1)-(1.2).\nThe WG-MFEM scheme (3.14)-(3.15) retains the mass conservation property of\n(1.1)-(1.2) locally on each element. This can be seen by choosing a piecewise constant\ntest function w in (3.15). More precisely, for any element T \u2208 Th , let w assume the\nvalue 1 on T and zero elsewhere. It follows from (3.15) that\n(\u2207w * qh , 1)T = (f, 1)T .\nThe definition of weak gradient (3.8) then implies the following identity\nZ\nZ\nf dx,\nqb * nds =\n\u2202T\n\nT\n\nwhich asserts a mass conservation for the WG-MFEM method.\nThe rest of the paper shall provide a theoretical foundation for the solvability and\naccuracy of the weak Galerkin mixed finite element scheme (3.14)-(3.15).\n4. Local Projections: Definition and Properties. We introduce two projection operators into the finite element spaces Vh and Wh by using local L2 projections.\nTo this end, for each element T \u2208 Th , denote by Q0 the usual L2 projection from\nL2 (T ) onto Pk (T ). Similarly, for each edge or flat face e \u2208 Eh , let Qb be the L2\nprojection from L2 (e) onto Pk (e). For any v = {v0 , vb ne } \u2208 V with vb \u2208 L2 (e) on\neach edge/face e, denote by\nQh v := {Q0 (v0 ), Qb (vb )ne }\nthe L2 projection of v in Vh . Next, denote by Qh the L2 projection from L2 (\u03a9) onto\nWh . Observe that Qh is in fact a composition of locally defined L2 projections into\nthe polynomial space Pk+1 (T ) for each element T \u2208 Th .\n\n\f9\nIn the usual finite element error analysis, one often reduces the error for finite\nelement solutions into the error between the exact solution and an appropriately\ndefined local projection or interpolation of the solution. For the WG-MFEM method\ndiscussed in previous sections, this refers to the error between the exact solution and\nits local L2 projection. The difficulty in estimating the projection error arises from\nthe fact that the finite element partition Th contains arbitrary polygons or polyhedra\nthat are different from the usual simplices as commonly employed in the standard\nfinite element methods [14].\nFor simplicity of notation, we shall use . to denote less than or equal to up to\na constant independent of the mesh size, variables, or other parameters appearing in\nthe inequality.\nLemma 4.1. Let Th be a finite element partition of \u03a9 satisfying the shape regularity assumptions A1 - A4 as given in Section 3. Then, we have\nX\n(4.1)\nkq \u2212 Q0 qk2T . h2(s+1) kqk2s+1 , 0 \u2264 s \u2264 k\nT \u2208Th\n\n(4.2)\n\nX\n\nk\u2207(q \u2212 Q0 q)k2T . h2s kqk2s+1 ,\n\n0\u2264s\u2264k\n\nT \u2208Th\n\n(4.3)\n\nX\n\nT \u2208Th\n\n\u0001\nku \u2212 Qh uk2T + h2T k\u2207(u \u2212 Qh u)k2T . h2(s+1) kuk2s+1 ,\n\n0 \u2264 s \u2264 k + 1.\n\nProof. To derive (4.1), let S(T ) be the circumscribed simplex of T on which q\ncan be defined by smooth extension if necessary. Let Q\u03030 q be the projection of q in\nthe element defined on S(T ). It follows that\n(4.4)\n\nkq \u2212 Q0 qkT \u2264 kq \u2212 Q\u03030 qkT \u2264 kq \u2212 Q\u03030 qkS(T ) . hs+1\nT kqks+1,S(T )\n\nUsing the above estimate we obtain\nX\nX\n(4.5)\nkq \u2212 Q0 qk2T . h2(s+1)\nkqk2s+1,S(T ) .\nT \u2208Th\n\nT \u2208Th\n\nIt follows from the assumption A4 that the set of the circumscribed simplices {S(T ) :\nT \u2208 Th } has a fixed and small number of overlaps. Thus, the following estimate holds\ntrue\nX\nkqk2s+1,S(T ) . kqk2s+1 .\nT \u2208Th\n\nSubstituting the above inequality into (4.5) yields the desired estimate (4.1).\nTo derive (4.2), we use the triangle inequality and the standard error estimate on\nS(T ) to obtain\nk\u2207(q \u2212 Q0 q)kT \u2264 k\u2207(q \u2212 Q\u03030 q)kS(T ) + k\u2207(Q\u03030 q \u2212 Q0 q)kS(T )\n(4.6)\n\n\u2264 ChsT kqks+1,S(T ) + Ch\u22121\nT kQ\u03030 q \u2212 Q0 qkS(T ) ,\n\nwhere we have also used the standard inverse inequality in the second line. Notice\nthat the assumption A3 on Th implies that there exists a ball B \u2282 T with a diameter\nproportional to hT . Thus, we have from Lemma A.3 (see Appendix) that\nkQ\u03030 q \u2212 Q0 qkS(T ) . kQ\u03030 q \u2212 Q0 qkB \u2264 kQ\u03030 q \u2212 Q0 qkT\n\u2264 kq \u2212 Q\u03030 qkT + kq \u2212 Q0 qkT\n. hs+1\nT kqks+1,S(T ) .\n\n\f10\nSubstituting the above estimate into (4.6) yields\nk\u2207(q \u2212 Q0 q)kT . hsT kqks+1,S(T ) .\nSumming up the above estimate over T \u2208 Th leads to the desired estimate (4.2).\nFinally, the estimate (4.3) can be established analogously to (4.1) and (4.2).\nWe shall derive two equations that play useful roles in the error analysis for the\nWG-MFEM. The first equation is given by the following Lemma.\nLemma 4.2. For any q \u2208 [H 1 (\u03a9)]d , let Qh q \u2208 Vh be the projection given by local\n2\nL projections. Then, on each element T , we have\n(4.7)\n\n(\u2207w * (Qh q), w)T = (\u2207 * q, w)T \u2212 hq * n \u2212 Qb (q * n), wi\u2202T\n\nfor all w \u2208 Pk+1 (T ). Moreover, by summing (4.7) over all T \u2208 Th we obtain\n(4.8)\n\nb(Qh q, w) = (\u2207 * q, w) \u2212\n\nX\n\nhq * n \u2212 Qb (q * n), wi\u2202T .\n\nT \u2208Th\n\nProof. For q \u2208 [H 1 (\u03a9)]d , we apply the definition of Qh and the weak divergence\n\u2207w * (Qh q) to obtain\n(\u2207w * Qh q, w)T = \u2212(Q0 q, \u2207w)T + hQb (q * ne )ne * n, wi\u2202T\n(4.9)\n\n= \u2212(Q0 q, \u2207w)T + hQb (q * n), wi\u2202T\n\nfor all w \u2208 Pk+1 (T ). Here we have used the fact that ne = \u00b1n. Since Q0 is the L2\nprojection into [Pk (T )]d , then\n\n(4.10)\n\n(Q0 q, \u2207w)T = (q, \u2207w)T\n= \u2212(\u2207 * q, w)T + hq * n, wi\u2202T ,\n\nwhere we have applied the usual divergence theorem in the second line. Substituting\n(4.10) into (4.9) yields (4.7). This completes the proof of the lemma.\nThe second equation is concerned with the bilinear form (\u2207w * v, Qh w) for v \u2208 Vh\nand w \u2208 H 1 (\u03a9). Using the definition of Qh and the integration by parts, we have for\nany v = {v0 , vb } \u2208 Vh and w \u2208 H 1 (T ) that\n(\u2207w * v, Qh w)T = \u2212(v0 , \u2207(Qh w))T + hvb * n, Qh wi\u2202T\n= (\u2207 * v0 , Qh w)T + h(vb \u2212 v0 ) * n, Qh wi\u2202T\n= (\u2207 * v0 , w)T + h(vb \u2212 v0 ) * n, Qh wi\u2202T\n= \u2212(v0 , \u2207w)T + hv0 * n, wi\u2202T + h(vb \u2212 v0 ) * n, Qh wi\u2202T\n= \u2212(v0 , \u2207w)T + h(v0 \u2212 vb ) * n, w \u2212 Qh wi\u2202T + hvb * n, wi\u2202T .\nThe result can be summarized as follows.\nLemma 4.3. For any v = {v0 , vb } \u2208 Vh and w \u2208 H 1 (T ) on the element T \u2208 Th ,\none has\n(\u2207w * v, Qh w)T = \u2212(v0 , \u2207w)T + h(v0 \u2212 vb ) * n, w \u2212 Qh wi\u2202T\n(4.11)\n\n+hvb * n, wi\u2202T .\n\n\f11\nMoreover, if w \u2208 H 1 (\u03a9), then the sum of (4.11) over all T \u2208 Th gives\nX\nb(v, Qh w) = \u2212(v0 , \u2207h w) +\nh(v0 \u2212 vb ) * n, w \u2212 Qh wi\u2202T\nT \u2208Th\n\n(4.12)\n\n+hvb * n, wi\u2202\u03a9 ,\n\nwhere \u2207h w is the gradient of w taken element-by-element.\nLet T \u2208 Th be any element, and q \u2208 [H 1 (T )]d . Then, we have from the definition\nof Qb that\nkq * n \u2212 Qb (q * n)k2\u2202T = hq * n \u2212 Qb (q * n), q * n \u2212 Qb (q * n)i\u2202T\n= hq * n \u2212 Qb (q * n), q * n \u2212 (Q0 q) * n)i\u2202T\n\u2264 kq * n \u2212 Qb (q * n)k\u2202T kq * n \u2212 (Q0 q) * nk\u2202T .\nIt follows that\n(4.13)\n\nkq * n \u2212 Qb (q * n)k\u2202T \u2264 kq * n \u2212 (Q0 q) * nk\u2202T .\n\nLemma 4.4. Let q \u2208 [H k+1 (\u03a9)]d and s be any real number such that 0 \u2264 s \u2264 k.\nThen, we have\nX\n(4.14)\nhT kq * n \u2212 Qb (q * n)k2\u2202T . h2(s+1) kqk2s+1 ,\nT \u2208Th\n\nand\n|||q \u2212 Qh q||| . \u03c1hs+1 kqks+1 .\n\n(4.15)\n\nProof. Apply the trace inequality (A.1) (see Appendix) to the right-hand side of\n(4.13) to obtain\n(4.16)\n\nhT kq * n \u2212 Qb (q * n)k2\u2202T . kq \u2212 Q0 qk2T + h2T k\u2207(q \u2212 Q0 q)k2T .\n\nThus, it follows from Lemma 4.1 that the estimate (4.14) holds true.\nTo derive (4.15), we have from the definition of the bilinear form s(*, *) in (3.13),\nthe definition of Qb , and the inequality (4.13) that\nX\ns(q \u2212 Qh q, q \u2212 Qh q)= \u03c1\nhT k(q \u2212 Q0 q) * n \u2212 (q * n \u2212 Qb (q * n))k2\u2202T\nT \u2208Th\n\n.\u03c1\n\nX\n\nhT k(q \u2212 Q0 q) * nk2\u2202T + kq * n \u2212 Qb (q * n)k2\u2202T\n\nT \u2208Th\n\n.\u03c1\n\nX\n\nhT k(q \u2212 Q0 q) * nk2\u2202T .\n\n\u0001\n\nT \u2208Th\n\nNow apply the trace inequality (A.1) to the last term of the above inequality to obtain\nX\n\u0001\n(4.17) s(q \u2212 Qh q, q \u2212 Qh q) . \u03c1\nkq \u2212 Q0 qk2T + h2T k\u2207(q \u2212 Q0 q)k2T .\nT \u2208Th\n\n\f12\nFinally, it follows from the triple-bar norm definition (5.7) and the above inequality\nthat\n2\n\n|||q \u2212 Qh q||| = a(q \u2212 Qh q, q \u2212 Qh q) + s(q \u2212 Qh q, q \u2212 Qh q)\n1\n\n= k\u03b1 2 (q \u2212 Q0 q)k2 + s(q \u2212 Qh q, q \u2212 Qh q),\n\nwhich, combined with Lemma 4.1, gives rise to the desired estimate (4.15). This\ncompletes the proof.\n5. Error Analysis. The goal of this section is to derive some optimal order error\nestimates for the WG-MFEM approximation (qh ; uh ) obtained from (3.14)-(3.15). In\nfinite element analysis, it is routine to decompose the error into two components in\nwhich the first is the difference between the exact solution and a properly defined\nprojection of the exact solution while the second is the difference of the finite element\nsolution with the same projection. In the current application, we shall employ the\nfollowing decomposition:\nq \u2212 qh = (q \u2212 Qh q) + (Qh q \u2212 qh ),\nu \u2212 uh = (u \u2212 Qh u) + (Qh u \u2212 uh ).\nFor simplicity, we introduce the following notation:\neh = {e0 , eb } := qh \u2212 Qh q,\n\u01ebh := uh \u2212 Qh u.\nQ\nP\nMoreover, we shall denote T \u2208Th k\u2207wk2T by k\u2207h wk2 for any w \u2208 T \u2208Th H 1 (T ).\n\n5.1. Error equations. The goal here is to derive equations that eh and \u01ebh must\nsatisfy. To this end, for any finite element function v = {v0 , vb } \u2208 Vh , we test the\nfirst equation of (1.1) against v0 to obtain\n(\u03b1q, v0 ) + (\u2207u, v0 ) = 0.\nNow applying the identity (4.12) to the term (\u2207u, v0 ) yields\nX\nh(v0 \u2212 vb ) * n, Qh u \u2212 ui\u2202T + hg, vb * ni\u2202\u03a9 ,\na(q, v) \u2212 b(v, Qh u) =\nT \u2208Th\n\nwhere the Dirichlet boundary condition (1.2) was also used. Recall that as (*, *) =\na(*, *) + s(*, *). Adding and subtracting as (Qh q, v) in the equation above gives\n\n(5.1)\n\nas (Qh q, v) \u2212 b(v, Qh u) = a(Qh q \u2212 q, v) + s(Qh q, v) + hg, vb * ni\u2202\u03a9\nX\n+\nh(v0 \u2212 vb ) * n, Qh u \u2212 ui\u2202T .\nT \u2208Th\n\nIt follows from the definition of the bilinear form s(*, *) that for any w \u2208 [H 1 (\u03a9)]d ,\none has\n(5.2)\n\ns(w, v) = 0,\n\n\u2200v \u2208 V.\n\nThus, we have s(Qh q, v) = s(Qh q \u2212 q, v) and\na(Qh q \u2212 q, v) + s(Qh q, v) = as (Qh q \u2212 q, v).\n\n\f13\nSubstituting the above into (5.1) yields\n\n(5.3)\n\nas (Qh q, v) \u2212 b(v, Qh u) = as (Qh q \u2212 q, v) + hg, vb * ni\u2202\u03a9\nX\n+\nh(v0 \u2212 vb ) * n, Qh u \u2212 ui\u2202T .\nT \u2208Th\n\nNext, we test the second equation of (1.1) against any w \u2208 Wh to obtain\n(\u2207 * q, w) = (f, w).\nSubstituting (4.8) into the above equation yields\nX\n(5.4)\nb(Qh q, w) = (f, w) \u2212\nhq * n \u2212 Qb (q * n), wi\u2202T .\nT \u2208Th\n\nNow, subtracting (5.3) from (3.14) gives\n(5.5) as (eh , v) \u2212 b(v, \u01ebh ) = as (q \u2212 Qh q, v) \u2212\n\nX\n\nh(v0 \u2212 vb ) * n, Qh u \u2212 ui\u2202T ,\n\nT \u2208Th\n\nfor all v \u2208 Vh . Similarly, subtracting (5.4) from (3.15) yields\nX\n(5.6)\nb(eh , w) =\nhq * n \u2212 Qb (q * n), wi\u2202T ,\nT \u2208Th\n\nfor all w \u2208 Wh .\nThe equations (5.5) and (5.6) constitute governing rules for the error term eh and\n\u01ebh . These are called error equations.\n5.2. Boundedness and inf-sup condition. For any interior edge or flat face\ne \u2208 Eh , let T1 and T2 be two elements sharing e in common. The jump of w \u2208 Wh on\ne is given by\n\u001a\nw|\u2202T1 \u2212 w|\u2202T2 , e \u2208 Eh0 ,\n[[w]]e =\nw,\ne \u2208 \u2202\u03a9.\nWe introduce a norm in V as follows\n(5.7)\n\n2\n\n|||v||| := a(v, v) + s(v, v),\n\nv \u2208 V.\n\nFurthermore, let k * k1,h be a norm in the space Wh + H 1 (\u03a9) defined as follows\nX\nX\n2\nh\u22121\nk\u2207wk2T +\n(5.8)\nkwk21,h :=\ne kQb [[w]]ke .\nT \u2208Th\n\ne\u2208Eh\n\nIt is not hard to see that k * k1,h defines a norm in Wh since kwk1,h = 0 would lead to\nw = const on each element T and [[w]] = Qb [[w]] = 0 on each edge or flat face e \u2208 Eh .\nIt follows that w = 0 on each element T . As to ||| * |||, assume that |||v||| = 0 for some\nv \u2208 Vh ; i.e.,\nX\n(\u03b1v0 , v0 ) + \u03c1\nhT h(v0 \u2212 vb ) * n, (v0 \u2212 vb ) * ni\u2202T = 0.\nT \u2208Th\n\nThis implies that v0 = 0 on each element T and (v0 \u2212 vb ) * n = 0 on each edge or\nflat face e \u2208 Eh . Thus, we have vb * n = 0 on each e \u2208 Eh . Recall that vb is a vector\n\n\f14\nparallel to n on each e \u2208 Eh . Hence, we must have vb = 0 on each e \u2208 Eh . The other\nproperties for a norm can be easily verified for k * k1,h and ||| * |||.\nIt is not hard to see that the triple-bar norm is essentially a discrete L2 norm,\nand the norm k * k1,h is an H 1 -equivalent norm in the corresponding space.\nLemma 5.1. For any \u03c6 \u2208 Wh , there exists at least one v \u2208 Vh such that\n|b(v, \u03c6)| = k\u03c6k21,h ,\n|||v||| . k\u03c6k1,h .\n\n(5.9)\n(5.10)\n\nTherefore, the following inf-sup condition is satisfied\n(5.11)\n\n|b(v, \u03c6)|\n\u2265 \u03b2k\u03c6k1,h\n|||v|||\n|||v|||6=0\n\nsup\nv\u2208Vh ,\n\nfor some positive constant \u03b2 independent of the meshsize h.\nProof. It follows from the definition of b(*, *) and the discrete divergence that\nb(v, \u03c6) = (\u2207w * v, \u03c6)\nX\n=\n(hvb * n, \u03c6i\u2202T \u2212 (v0 , \u2207\u03c6)T )\nT \u2208Th\n\n=\n\nX\n\nhvb * ne , [[\u03c6]]ie \u2212\n\nX\n\n(v0 , \u2207\u03c6)T ,\n\nT \u2208Th\n\ne\u2208Eh\n\nprovided that the jump [[\u03c6]] was taken consistently with the direction set Dh . Now\nby taking v0 = \u2212\u2207\u03c6 on each element T and vb = h\u22121\ne Qb ([[\u03c6]])ne on each edge or flat\nface e we arrive at\nX\nX\n2\nb(v, \u03c6) =\n(\u2207\u03c6, \u2207\u03c6)T +\nh\u22121\ne hQb [[\u03c6]], Qb [[\u03c6]]ie = k\u03c6k1,h ,\nT \u2208Th\n\ne\u2208Eh\n\nwhich verifies (5.9). To verify (5.10), we apply the definition of the triple-bar norm\nto the above chosen v to obtain\nX\n2\n2\nhT k\u2207\u03c6 * n + h\u22121\n|||v||| = (\u03b1\u2207h \u03c6, \u2207h \u03c6) + \u03c1\ne Qb ([[\u03c6]])ne * nk\u2202T\nT \u2208Th\n\n2\n\n. k\u2207h \u03c6k +\n\nX\n\n2\nh\u22121\ne kQb [[\u03c6]]ke\n\n= k\u03c6k21,h ,\n\ne\u2208Eh\n\nwhich is what (5.10) states for.\nLemma 5.2. The bilinear form b(*, *) is bounded in Vh \u00d7 Wh . In other words,\nthere exists a constant C such that\n(5.12)\n\n|b(v, \u03c6)| \u2264 C|||v||| k\u03c6k1,h .\n\nProof. We note from the definition of weak divergence that\nb(v, \u03c6) = (\u2207w * v, \u03c6)\nX\n=\n(hvb * n, \u03c6i\u2202T \u2212 (v0 , \u2207\u03c6)T )\nT \u2208Th\n\n=\n\nX\n\ne\u2208Eh\n\nhvb * ne , [[\u03c6]]ie \u2212\n\nX\n\nT \u2208Th\n\n(v0 , \u2207\u03c6)T .\n\n\f15\nUsing Cauchy-Schwarz we obtain\nX\nX\n|b(v, \u03c6)| \u2264\nkvb * ne ke k[[\u03c6]]ke +\nkv0 kT k\u2207\u03c6kT\ne\u2208Eh\n\n\u2264\n\nT \u2208Th\n\nX\n\nhe kvb * ne k2e\n\ne\u2208Eh\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\u2264\uf8ed\n\n(5.13)\n\nX\n\n! 12\n\nhe kvb * ne k2e\n\ne\u2208Eh\n\nX\n\n2\nh\u22121\ne k[[\u03c6]]ke\n\ne\u2208Eh\n\n! 21\n\n! 12\n\n+ kv0 k k\u2207h \u03c6k\n\n\uf8f6\n\n+ kv0 k\uf8f8 k\u03c6k1,h .\n\nLet T be an element that takes e as an edge or flat face. Then, using the trace\ninequality (A.1) and the inverse inequality (A.21) we obtain\nhe kvb * ne k2e \u2264 2he k(vb \u2212 v0 ) * ne k2e + 2he kv0 * ne k2e\n. he k(vb \u2212 v0 ) * ne k2e + kv0 k2T .\nSubstituting the above inequality into (5.13) yields\n|b(v, \u03c6)| . |||v||| k\u03c6k1,h ,\nwhich completes the proof of the lemma.\n5.3. Error estimates. We first establish some estimates useful in the forthcoming error estimates.\nLemma 5.3. Let u \u2208 H k+2 (\u03a9) and q \u2208 [H k+1 (\u03a9)]d be two smooth functions on\n\u03a9. Then, the following estimates hold true\nX\n(5.14)\n|h(v0 \u2212 vb ) * n, Qh u \u2212 ui\u2202T | . hs+1 kuks+2 |||v|||, 0 \u2264 s \u2264 k,\nT \u2208Th\n\n(5.15)\n\nX\n\n|hq * n \u2212 Qb (q * n), \u03c6i\u2202T | . hs+1 kqks+1 k\u2207h \u03c6k, 0 \u2264 s \u2264 k,\n\nT \u2208Th\n\nQ\nfor all v \u2208 V and \u03c6 \u2208 T \u2208Th H 1 (T ).\nProof. It follows from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, the definition of ||| * |||, and\nthe trace inequality (A.1) that\nX\n\nX\n\n|h(v0 \u2212 vb ) * n, Qh u \u2212 ui\u2202T |.\n\nT \u2208Th\n\nhT k(v0 \u2212 vb ) *\n\nnk2\u2202T\n\nT \u2208Th\n\n*\n\nX\n\nh\u22121\nT kQh u\n\nT \u2208Th\n\n. |||v|||\n\nX\n\n\u2212\n\nuk2\u2202T\n\n! 21\n\n! 21\n! 21\n\u0001\n2\n\n2\nh\u22122\nT kQh u \u2212 ukT + k\u2207(Qh u \u2212 u)kT\n\nT \u2208Th\n\n. hs+1 |||v||| kuks+2 ,\nwhere we have used the estimate (4.3). This verifies the validity of (5.14).\n\n\f16\nNext, let \u03c6\u0304 be the average of \u03c6 over each element T . It follows from the definition\nof Qb , the estimates (4.14), and (A.1) that\nX\nX\n|hq * n \u2212 Qb (q * n), \u03c6i\u2202T | =\n|hq * n \u2212 Qb (q * n), \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6\u0304i\u2202T |\nT \u2208Th\n\n\u2264\n\nT \u2208Th\n\nX\n\nhT kq * n \u2212 Qb (q *\n\nn)k2\u2202T\n\nT \u2208Th\n\n. hs+1 kqks+1\n\nX\n\n! 21\n\nX\n\n.h\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c6\u0304k2\u2202T\n\nT \u2208Th\n\n! 12\n\n! 21\n\u0001\n2\n\n2\nh\u22122\nT k\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6\u0304kT + k\u2207\u03c6kT\n\nT \u2208Th\ns+1\n\nh\u22121\nT k\u03c6\n\nkqks+1 k\u2207h \u03c6k,\n\nwhich completes the proof of (5.15).\nWith the help of Lemma 5.3, Lemma 5.1, and Lemma 5.2, we are now in a position\nto derive an error estimate for the WG-MFEM solution (qh ; uh ) in the norm ||| * ||| and\nk * k1,h respectively.\nTheorem 5.4. Let qh \u2208 Vh and uh \u2208 Wh be the solution of the weak Galerkin\nmixed finite element scheme (3.14)-(3.15). Assume that the exact solution (q; u) of\n(1.3)-(1.4) is regular such that u \u2208 H s+2 (\u03a9) and q \u2208 [H s+1 (\u03a9)]d with s \u2208 (0, k].\nThen, one has\n(5.16)\n\n|||qh \u2212 Qh q||| + kuh \u2212 Qh uk1,h . hs+1 (kuks+2 + kqks+1 ) .\n\nProof.

The error equations (5.5) and\n(5.6) indicate that the pair (eh ; \u01ebh ) is a solution of the following problem\n(5.17)\n(5.18)\n\nas (eh , v) \u2212 b(v, \u01ebh ) = l(v),\nb(eh , w) = \u03c7(w),\n\n\u2200v \u2208 Vh ,\n\u2200w \u2208 Wh .\n\nThe bilinear form as (*, *) is clearly bounded, symmetric and positive definite in Vh\nequipped with the triple-bar norm ||| * |||. Lemma 5.2 indicates that the bilinear form\nb(*, *) is bounded in Vh \u00d7 Wh , and Lemma 5.1 proved that the usual inf-sup condition\nof Bab\u016dska [3] and Brezzi [8] is satisfied. Thus, we have from the general theory of\nBab\u016dska and Brezzi that\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(5.19)\n|||eh ||| + k\u01ebh k1,h \u2264 C klkVh\u2032 + k\u03c7kWh\u2032 ,\nwhere klkVh\u2032 and k\u03c7kWh\u2032 are the norm of the corresponding linear functionals. To\nestimate the norms, we use (4.15) and (5.14) to come up with\n|l(v)| . hs+1 (kqks+1 + kuks+2 ) |||v|||.\n\n\f17\nThus, we have\nklkVh\u2032 . hs+1 (kqks+1 + kuks+2 ) ,\n\n(5.20)\n\n0 \u2264 s \u2264 k.\n\nAs to the norm of \u03c7, we use the estimate (5.15) to obtain\n|\u03c7(w)| . hs+1 kqks+1 kwk1,h ,\n\n0 \u2264 s \u2264 k,\n\nwhich implies that\nk\u03c7kWh\u2032 . hs+1 kqks+1 ,\n\n(5.21)\n\n0 \u2264 s \u2264 k.\n\nSubstituting (5.20) and (5.21) into (5.19) yields the desired error estimate (5.16).\n6.

Testing (6.2) by \u01ebh = uh \u2212 Qh u and then using (4.8) yields\n(\u01ebh , \u01ebh ) = (\u2207 * \u03a8, \u01ebh )\n(6.9)\n\n= b(Qh \u03a8, \u01ebh ) +\n\nX\n\nh\u03a8 * n \u2212 Qb (\u03a8 * n), \u01ebh i\u2202T .\n\nT \u2208Th\n\nIt follows from (5.5) that\nb(Qh \u03a8, \u01ebh )= as (eh , Qh \u03a8) \u2212 as (q \u2212 Qh q, Qh \u03a8)\nX\n+\nh(Q0 \u03a8) * n \u2212 Qb (\u03a8 * n), Qh u \u2212 ui\u2202T .\nT\n\nSubstituting the above equation into (6.9) yields\n\n(6.10)\n\n(\u01ebh , \u01ebh ) = as (eh , Qh \u03a8) \u2212 as (q \u2212 Qh q, Qh \u03a8)\nX\n+\nhQ0 \u03a8 * n \u2212 Qb (\u03a8 * n), Qh u \u2212 ui\u2202T\nT \u2208Th\n\n+\n\nX\n\nT \u2208Th\n\nh\u03a8 * n \u2212 Qb (\u03a8 * n), \u01ebh i\u2202T .\n\n\f19\nUsing (6.6) we obtain\nX\n(6.11)\nhQ0 \u03a8 * n \u2212 Qb (\u03a8 * n), Qh u \u2212 ui\u2202T . hk+2 kukk+2 k\u03a8k1 .\nT \u2208Th\n\nUsing (5.15) we arrive at\nX\nh\u03a8 * n \u2212 Qb (\u03a8 * n), \u01ebh i\u2202T . hk\u2207h \u01ebh k k\u03a8k1 .\n(6.12)\nT \u2208Th\n\nFrom (6.5) we have\n|as (q \u2212 Qh q, Qh \u03a8)| . hk+2 kqkk+1 k\u03a8k1 .\n\n(6.13)\n\nNow substituting (6.11)-(6.13) into (6.10) we obtain\n(6.14) (\u01ebh , \u01ebh ) . |as (eh , Qh \u03a8)| + hk+2 (kqkk+1 + kukk+2 ) k\u03a8k1 + hk\u2207h \u01ebh k k\u03a8k1 .\nIt remains to deal with |as (eh , Qh \u03a8)| in (6.14). To this end, we note that\nas (eh , Qh \u03a8) = as (eh , Qh \u03a8 \u2212 \u03a8) + as (eh , \u03a8),\nand\n|as (eh , Qh \u03a8 \u2212 \u03a8)| \u2264 |||eh ||| |||Qh \u03a8 \u2212 \u03a8||| . h|||eh ||| k\u03a8k1 .\nThus,\n(6.15)\n\n|as (eh , Qh \u03a8)| . |as (eh , \u03a8)| + h|||eh ||| k\u03a8k1.\n\nSince \u03a8 \u2208 [H 1 (\u03a9)]d , then we have as (eh , \u03a8) = a(eh , \u03a8); i.e., the stabilization term\nvanishes when one of the components is sufficiently regular. Now testing (6.1) against\neh gives\na(eh , \u03a8) = (\u03b1\u03a8, e0 ) = \u2212(\u2207\u03c6, e0 ).\nFurthermore, we have from (4.12) (with v = eh and w = \u03c6) and the fact that \u03c6 = 0\non \u2202\u03a9 that\nX\nh(e0 \u2212 eb ) * n, \u03c6 \u2212 Qh \u03c6i\u2202T .\n(\u2207\u03c6, e0 ) = \u2212b(eh , Qh \u03c6) +\nT \u2208Th\n\nUsing the error equation (5.6) to replace the term b(eh , Qh \u03c6) in above equation we\nobtain\nX\nX\n(\u2207\u03c6, e0 ) = \u2212\nhq * n \u2212 Qb (q * n), Qh \u03c6i\u2202T +\nh(e0 \u2212 eb ) * n, \u03c6 \u2212 Qh \u03c6i\u2202T\nT \u2208Th\n\n=\n\nX\n\nT \u2208Th\n\nT \u2208Th\n\nhq * n \u2212 Qb (q * n), \u03c6 \u2212 Qh \u03c6i\u2202T +\n\nX\n\nh(e0 \u2212 eb ) * n, \u03c6 \u2212 Qh \u03c6i\u2202T ,\n\nT \u2208Th\n\nwhere we have used the fact that \u03c6 \u2208 H 1 (\u03a9) and \u03c6 = 0 on \u2202\u03a9 in the second line.\nNow using (6.7) to estimate the first summation in the above equation, and (5.14)\nwith s = 0, v = eh , u = \u03c6 to estimate the second summation we obtain\n|(\u2207\u03c6, e0 )| . (hk+2 kqkk+1 + h|||eh |||) k\u03c6k2 .\n\n\f20\nThus,\n|as (eh , \u03a8)| = |a(eh , \u03a8)| = |(\u2207\u03c6, e0 )| . (hk+2 kqkk+1 + h|||eh |||) k\u03c6k2 .\nSubstituting the above into (6.15) yields\n(6.16)\n\n|as (eh , Qh \u03a8)| . (hk+2 kqkk+1 + h|||eh |||) k\u03c6k2 + h|||eh ||| k\u03a8k1 .\n\nNow substituting (6.16) into (6.14) gives\n(6.17)\n\n(\u01ebh , \u01ebh ) .(hk+2 kqkk+1 + h|||eh |||) k\u03c6k2 + h|||eh ||| k\u03a8k1\n+hk+2 (kqkk+1 + kukk+2 ) k\u03a8k1 + hk\u2207h \u01ebh k k\u03a8k1.\n\nObserve that the H 2 -regularity of the dual problem implies the following estimate\nk\u03c6k2 + k\u03a8k1 . k\u01ebh k.\nSubstituting the above into (6.17) and then dividing both sides by k\u01ebh k we obtain\nk\u01ebh k . h(|||eh ||| + k\u2207h \u01ebh k) + hk+2 (kqkk+1 + kukk+2 ) ,\nwhich, together with (5.16), implies the desired L2 error estimate (6.8). This completes the proof.\nAppendix A. The goal of this Appendix is to establish some fundamental estimates useful in the error estimate for WG-MFEM. First, we derive a trace inequality\nfor functions defined on the finite element partition Th with properties specified in\nSection 3.\nLemma A.1 (Trace Inequality). Let Th be a partition of the domain \u03a9 into polygons in 2D or polyhedra in 3D. Assume that the partition Th satisfies the assumptions\n(A1), (A2), and (A3) as specified in Section 3. Then, there exists a constant C such\nthat for any T \u2208 Th and edge/face e \u2208 \u2202T , we have\n\u0001\n(A.1)\nk\u03b8k2e \u2264 C hT\u22121 k\u03b8k2T + hT k\u2207\u03b8k2T ,\n\nwhere \u03b8 \u2208 H 1 (T ) is any function.\nProof. We shall provide a proof for the case of e being a flat face and \u03b8 \u2208 C 1 (T ).\nTo this end, let the flat face e be represented by the following parametric equation:\n(A.2)\n\nxe = \u03c6(\u03be, \u03b7) := (\u03c61 (\u03be, \u03b7), \u03c62 (\u03be, \u03b7), \u03c63 (\u03be, \u03b7))\n\nfor (\u03be, \u03b7) \u2208 D \u2282 R2 . By Assumption A3, there exists a pyramid P (e, T, Ae ) with apex\nAe = x\u2217 := (x\u22171 , x\u22172 , x\u22173 ) contained in the element T , see Figure 3.1. This pyramid has\nthe following parametric representation:\n(A.3)\n\nx(t, \u03be, \u03b7) = (1 \u2212 t)\u03c6(\u03be, \u03b7) + tx\u2217\n\nfor (t, \u03be, \u03b7) \u2208 [0, 1] \u00d7 D. For any given xe \u2208 e, the line segment joining xe and the\napex x\u2217 can be represented by\nx(t) = xe + t(x\u2217 \u2212 xe ).\nFrom the fundamental theorem of Calculus, we have\nZ t\n\u2202\u03c4 \u03b82 (xe + \u03c4 \u03c9)d\u03c4,\n\u03b82 (xe ) \u2212 \u03b82 (x(t)) = \u2212\n0\n\n\u03c9 = x\u2217 \u2212 xe .\n\n\f21\nThe above can be further rewritten as\n\u03b82 (xe ) \u2212 \u03b82 (x(t)) = \u22122\n\nt\n\nZ\n\n\u03b8 (\u2207\u03b8 * \u03c9) d\u03c4.\n\n0\n\nIt follows from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality that for any t \u2208 [0, 12 ] we have\n2\n\nhT\u22121\n\n2\n\n\u03b8 (xe ) \u2264 \u03b8 (x(t)) +\n\nZ\n\n1\n2\n\n2\n\n\u03b8 |\u03c9|d\u03c4 + hT\n\n0\n\nZ\n\n1\n2\n\n|\u2207\u03b8|2 |\u03c9|d\u03c4.\n\n0\n\nNow we integrate the above inequality over the flat face e by using the parametric\nequation (A.2), yielding\nZ\nZ\n2\n\u03b82 (x(t))|\u03c6\u03be \u00d7 \u03c6\u03b7 |d\u03bed\u03b7\n\u03b8 (xe )|\u03c6\u03be \u00d7 \u03c6\u03b7 |d\u03bed\u03b7 \u2264\nD\n\nD\n\n+h\u22121\nT\n\n(A.4)\n(A.5)\n\n+hT\n\nZ\n\n1\n2\n\n0\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u03b82 |\u03c9||\u03c6\u03be \u00d7 \u03c6\u03b7 |d\u03bed\u03b7d\u03c4\n\nD\n\nZ\n\n|\u2207\u03b8|2 |\u03c9||\u03c6\u03be \u00d7 \u03c6\u03b7 |d\u03bed\u03b7d\u03c4.\n\nD\n\nObserve that the integral of a function over the following prismatoid\nP 21 := {x(t, \u03be, \u03b7) :\n\n(t, \u03be, \u03b7) \u2208 [0, 1/2] \u00d7 D}\n\nis given by\nZ\n\nf (x)dx =\n\nP1\n\n2\n\nZ\n\n1\n2\n\n0\n\nZ\n\nf (x(\u03c4, \u03be, \u03b7))J(\u03c4, \u03be, \u03b7)d\u03bed\u03b7d\u03c4,\n\nD\n\nwhere J(\u03c4, \u03be, \u03b7) = (1 \u2212 \u03c4 )2 |(\u03c6\u03be \u00d7 \u03c6\u03b7 ) * \u03c9| is the Jacobian from the coordinate change.\nThe vector \u03c6\u03be \u00d7 \u03c6\u03b7 is normal to the face e, and \u03c9 = x\u2217 \u2212 xe is a vector from the base\npoint xe to the apex x\u2217 . The angle assumption (see Assumption A3 of Section 3) for\nthe prism P (e, T, Ae ) indicates that the Jacobian satisfies the following relation\n(A.6)\n\nJ(\u03c4, \u03be, \u03b7) \u2265\n\n\u03bc0\n|\u03c6\u03be \u00d7 \u03c6\u03b7 | |\u03c9|,\n4\n\n\u03c4 \u2208 [0, 1/2]\n\nfor some fixed \u03bc0 \u2208 (0, 1).

Let Th be a finite element partition of \u03a9 consisting of polygons or polyhedra. Assume that Th satisfies all the assumptions A1-A4\nas specified in Section 3. Then, there exists a constant C = C(n) such that\n(A.21)\n\nk\u2207\u03c6kT \u2264 C(n)hT\u22121 k\u03c6kT ,\n\n\u2200T \u2208 Th\n\nfor any piecewise polynomial \u03c6 of degree n on Th .\nProof. The proof is merely a combination of Lemma A.3 and the standard inverse\ninequality on d-simplices. To this end, for any T \u2208 Th , let S(T ) be the circumscribed\nsimplex that is shape regular. It follows from the standard inverse inequality that\nk\u2207\u03c6kT \u2264 k\u2207\u03c6kS(T ) \u2264 ChT\u22121 k\u03c6kS(T ) .\nThen we use the estimate (A.20), with K = S(T ), to obtain\nk\u2207\u03c6kT \u2264 ChT\u22121 k\u03c6kS \u2264 Ch\u22121\nT k\u03c6kT ,\nwhere S is a ball inside of T with a diameter proportional to hT . This completes the\nproof of the lemma.\n\n\f25\nREFERENCES\n[1] D. N. Arnold and F.
