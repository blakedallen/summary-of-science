INTRODUCTION\n\nSoft gamma rays (200 keV\u201320 MeV) are important\nprobes of the most violent and extreme processes in the\ncosmos. Gamma rays are produced by non-thermal processes in such disparate objects as neutron stars, X-ray\nbinaries, and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), and they\nalso result from the decays of many radioactive nuclei\nthat are released by supernova explosions, such as 26 Al,\n60\nFe, and 44 Ti. The penetrating nature of gamma rays\nallows the astrophysicist to probe deep within these often\nobscured systems and make unique and complementary\nobservations of their gravitational fields, magnetic fields,\nand nuclear reactions.\nOver the last four decades, various types of telescopes\nhave been developed to detect and image soft gammarays. One prominent technology is the Compton telescope, which exploits the Compton effect to perform direct imaging of gamma-ray photons. The Compton effect\noccurs when a gamma-ray photon incoherently scatters\nwith an electron and is deflected by an angle \u03c6. The\nCompton scatter formula relates the energy of the scattered gamma-ray photon E\u03b31 and the incident photon\nenergy E\u03b30 to the scatter angle \u03c6:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\ncos \u03c6 = 1 \u2212 me c2\n(1)\n\u2212\nE\u03b31\nE\u03b30\nElectronic address: bandstra@ssl.berkeley.edu\n1 University of California Space Sciences Laboratory, Berkeley,\nCA 94720\n2 National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, 30013\n3 National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan, 32001\n4 National United University, Miaoli, Taiwan, 36003\n5 Institute of Physics, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan, 11529\n6 Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720\n7 Centre d'Etude Spatiale des Rayonnements (CESR), 31028\nToulouse, France, Cedex 4\n8 Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY), Notkestr. 85,\n22607 Hamburg, Germany\n\nwhere me c2 = 511 keV is the rest mass energy of the electron (Compton 1923). The basic principle of Compton\nimaging is to measure the energies deposited by at least\none Compton scatter and employ Equation 1 to reconstruct the direction of the incoming photon. If both the\ndirection of the scattered photon and cos \u03c6 can be measured, then the photon's direction can be constrained to\na circle on the sky (the \"Compton circle\"). The Compton effect is also intrinsically sensitive to the polarization of the incident photon through the Klein-Nishina\ncross section (Klein & Nishina 1929), enabling a Compton telescope to potentially measure the polarization of\na gamma-ray source.\nThe first satellite-borne Compton telescope was\nCOMPTEL on board the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (Sch\u00f6nfelder et al. 1993), which consisted of\ntwo layers of scintillator detectors spaced by 1.5 meters. Photons were required to scatter in the top layer\nand be fully absorbed in the bottom layer. COMPTEL\nsucceeded in making measurements and images of the\ngamma-ray regime to unprecedented sensitivity, including the first detection of 44 Ti from a supernova remnant (Iyudin et al. 1994) and a map of the galactic 26 Al\ndistribution (Oberlack et al. 1996).\nTo build on the successes of COMPTEL, the next\ngeneration Compton telescopes utilize a compact design, which requires detectors with both fine position\nand fine energy resolution to track individual gammaray interactions within the detector volume. Compact Compton Telescopes (CCTs) can achieve effective areas comparable to COMPTEL's with an instrument that is a fraction of the size (Boggs & Jean\n2001). The first CCT was LXeGRIT, which uses a\nsingle liquid xenon time projection chamber (TPC)\nto measure interaction positions with high spatial resolution (\u22483 mm) and energy resolution (\u224810% at\n1 MeV) (Aprile et al. 1993a, 2000). Various CCTs are\n\n\f2\n\nBandstra et al.\n\ncurrently being developed that use other detector materials (e.g., Kurfess et al. (2007); O'Neill et al. (2003);\nBloser et al. (2002); Takeda et al. (2007); Ueno et al.\n(2008); Hunter et al. (2008); Kroeger et al. (1995);\nKurfess et al. (2003)).\nIn this paper we will briefly describe the NCT instrument (Section 2), then describe the event selections and\npresent the first image of the Crab (Sections 3 and 4).\nWe discuss two analysis tools: Monte Carlo simulations\nof our observation of the Crab and the Angular Resolution Measure (ARM) for a Compton telescope (Sections 5\nand 6). Using these tools, we determine the significance\nof the Crab detection using the total counts, an analysis\nof the spectrum, and an analysis of the ARM histogram\n(Sections 7\u20139). Polarization analysis of the Crab was not\nperformed due to the lack of sufficient counts.\n2. THE NCT INSTRUMENT\n\nThe NCT instrument (Boggs et al. 2001, 2003, 2004;\nChang et al. 2007) is a balloon-borne CCT that utilizes high-purity crossed-strip germanium detectors for\nCompton imaging. To date, NCT has flown on two\nconventional balloon flights. The first was a prototype flight in 2005 that succeeded in measuring the soft\ngamma-ray atmospheric background and galactic anticenter region (Coburn et al. 2005; Bowen et al. 2007;\nBowen 2009). The full 10-GeD version of NCT was flown\non its second flight in May 2009 (Bandstra et al. 2009),\nand the first results are presented here.\nThe heart of NCT is its ten crossed-strip highpurity germanium detectors (GeDs) (Amman & Luke\n2000; Amman et al. 2007). Each GeD has the ability\nto record in three dimensions the location of each individual photon interaction. A single GeD measures\n8 cm \u00d7 8 cm \u00d7 1.5 cm and has 37 strips on each\nside, with a strip pitch of 2 mm. NCT is designed\nsuch that when a gamma ray undergoes at least one\nCompton scatter and is fully absorbed inside the detectors, the individual scatter positions and energy deposits can be measured. Compton Kinematic Discrimination algorithms (Aprile et al. 1993b; Boggs & Jean\n2000; Oberlack et al. 2000; Kroeger et al. 2002) are used\nto find the most likely scattering order, and then the\ntotal gamma-ray energy can be reconstructed and the\ninitial direction can be traced to a ring on the sky. Thus\nNCT works as both a spectrometer and an imager, and is\nintrinsically sensitive to polarization because it exploits\nCompton scattering.\nThe entire set of detectors and their cryostat are enclosed inside a well of anticoincidence BGO shields to\nreduce the Earth albedo and atmospheric backgrounds.\nThe resulting overall field of view is primarily limited\nby the BGO shields to \u223c3.2 sr. The entire instrument\nand readout electronics are mounted in a pointed, autonomous balloon gondola. Further details of the gondola systems can be found in Bellm et al. (2009a).\nData from the detectors are processed on-board by conventional surface-mount electronics (Coburn et al. 2004;\nBandstra et al. 2007), which return the energy and timing of each strip above threshold during an event. The\nevent information is processed on-board and telemetered\nto the ground. More details on the digital system, including flow charts of the digital logic involved in acquiring\nevents, can be found in Hung et al. (2009).\n\nThe software analysis tools for NCT are built using the Medium Energy Gamma-ray Astronomy library\n(MEGAlib) (Zoglauer et al. 2006, 2008). MEGAlib provides utilities for simulations (Zoglauer et al. 2009), geometry modeling, event reconstruction, and imaging reconstruction (Zoglauer et al. 2010), in addition to tools\nfor building a custom analysis pipeline. The NCT\ndata analysis pipeline is explained in further detail\nby Bandstra et al. (2009).\n3. DATA SELECTIONS\n\nNCT was launched from the Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility (CSBF) in Fort Sumner, New Mexico\n(34.5\u25e6 N, 104.2\u25e6 W) at 1330 UT 5/17/2009. The flight\nwas terminated at 0400 UT 5/19/2009 near Kingman,\nArizona (34.9\u25e6 N, 113.7\u25e6W). Altitude was maintained\nbetween 35 and 40 km for the entire time the detectors\nwere operational. The total flight time was 38.5 hours,\nwith nine of the ten detectors on for a total of 22 hours\nat float. Approximately 33 ks of data were taken with\nthe Crab above 40\u25e6 elevation. A discussion of the flight\ncan be found in Bandstra et al. (2009).\nData from the flight were selected only when the Crab\nwas above 40\u25e6 elevation both to minimize atmospheric\nabsorption and to sample the background (as will be discussed in Sections 8 and 9). During the chosen observation time, the average livetime for the instrument was\nnearly constant with an average value of 92%. Taking\ninto account the livetime and \u22481 ks of dead time due to\ndata acquisition system and flight computer resets, the\neffective Crab observation time was 29.3 ks.\n3.1. Event Reconstruction\nEvent reconstruction for events with three or more interactions was done using the Compton Kinematic Discrimination (CKD) algorithm of Boggs & Jean (2000).\nFor events with N interactions, there are N \u2212 2 Compton scatter angles that can be measured (i.e., at all but\nthe first and last interaction points), and this allows for\na figure-of-merit with N \u2212 2 degrees of freedom to be\ncalculated for each possible event ordering. The best\ninteraction ordering of the N ! possible orderings is selected. In principle, the more interactions there are, the\nmore information there is about the event and the better it can be reconstructed (or rejected) using CKD. A\nlimit of seven interactions was chosen because the number of events with more than seven interactions becomes\nvery small (fewer than 1%) and the time to reconstruct\na single event scales like N factorial.\nTwo-interaction events (i.e., a Compton scatter and\nphotoabsorption) lack any kinematic degrees of freedom\nand cannot be reconstructed using CKD. Their interaction ordering is often ambiguous, and a single-scatter reconstruction technique must be used. After trying different techniques on the NCT calibration data, we found the\ntechnique that properly reconstructed the most events\nwas to choose the ordering that maximized the product\nof the Klein-Nishina cross section for the implied scatter angle with the probability of a photoabsorption at or\nbefore the second interaction.\n3.2. Background Reduction\n\nThe gamma-ray background at balloon altitudes was\nmeasured by the NCT prototype during its 2005 balloon\n\n\fDetection and Imaging of the Crab with NCT\nflight (Bowen 2009). The background primarily consists\nof three kinds of background events: real photons coming from outer space and from cosmic-ray interactions\nin the atmosphere; cosmogenic particles such as protons\nand neutrons; and instrumental events coming from radioactivities in the instrument.\nSimulations are used to estimate how many instrumental events survive the event reconstruction process. Such\ncomparisons to simulations have been done, and the result is that instrumental events are effectively eliminated\nby CKD, and the background is dominated by real photons \u2013 predominantly atmospheric continuum photons,\ncosmic photons, and atmospheric 511 keV photons; and\nparticle interactions are very few (Bowen 2009). The\n2005 measurements yielded good agreement with simulations, and these simulation inputs were used again to\nestimate the background during the 2009 flight.\nThe atmospheric background continuum has been\nextensively studied and measured (e.g., Ling (1975);\nLing & Gruber (1977); Graser & Sch\u00f6nfelder (1977);\nSch\u00f6nfelder et al. (1977)). The continuum has an elevation angle dependence - the specific intensity should be\napproximately constant and then rise sharply at the horizontal. The intensity in the horizontal direction should\nbe larger than that from the vertical by a factor of \u22482\u20134\nover the energy range 300\u20131000 keV. This sharp rise in\nthe horizontal direction is another reason for requiring\nthat the Crab be above 40\u25e6 in elevation.\nIn addition, the NCT's BGO shielding was designed so\nthat it would have a very wide field of view away from\nthe Earth, reducing background photons that are coming from the atmosphere below and from the sides. An\nEarth horizon cut (Table 1) is also applied to further\nreduce background that is coming from the atmosphere\nbelow. However, background photons from the atmosphere above can only be reduced by shielding, with a\ncorresponding reduced field of view.\nAn energy cut of 300\u2212495 keV and 520\u22121500 keV\nexcluded a few other sources of background. The cut\navoids the very strong atmospheric 511 keV background\nline. Also, below \u2248300 keV, discrepancies were noticed\nbetween the observed background continuum and simulations, with NCT observing fewer counts by a factor\nof two in that region (Chiu 2010). The comparison of\nsimulations and effective area calibration data at higher\nenergies reveals a deficit of measured photons when a\nsource is placed in the plane of the detectors, presumably because the simulations underestimate the shielding effect of the detector guard rings. This effect is more\npronounced for lower energy photons and likely leads to\nthe measured deficit. This low-energy region (<300 keV)\nwill be excluded from the analysis.\n3.3. Interaction Distance\n\nIt also became clear from simulations and measured\nbackground rates that the other data cuts used for the\nflight data should be wide in order to attain the best\nsensitivity. We chose one major constraint - to limit\nthe distance between the first and second interactions\nin the detectors - in order to improve the angular resolution of the instrument and thus the signal-to-noise.\nThis choice is effective because the position resolution\nof the NCT detectors is the the dominant contribution\nto the angular resolution (Bandstra et al. 2006), and the\n\n3\n\nTable 1\nData cuts used on flight data\nParameter\nCrab elevation\nPhoton energy\nNumber of interactions\nEarth horizon\nCompton scatter angle (\u03c6)\nMinimum distance between\nfirst two interactions\nMinimum distance between\nany two interactions\n\nAllowed range\n>40\u25e6\n300\u2212495 keV, 520\u22121500 keV\n2\u22127\nReject if >99% of Compton\ncircle is below elevation of 0\u25e6\nno restriction (0\u25e6 \u2212180\u25e6 )\n1.2 cm\n0.4 cm\n\nvector between the first two interactions sets the axis of\nthe Compton circle. Therefore, requiring a longer initial\nscatter distance improves the angular resolution, but the\ncost is that the number of events is reduced, especially\nthose with three or more interactions. Based on simulations of the Crab, setting a lower limit of 1.2 cm for\nthe first interaction distance improves the angular width\nof the Crab (10\u25e6 ARM FWHM to 7.4\u25e6 ARM FWHM),\nwhile eliminating only 40% of the events within the central FWHM of the ARM distribution (see Section 6 for\na definition and discussion of the ARM). The cut is also\nmeant to improve the likelihood that an event is properly\nreconstructed by ensuring that the first two interactions\nare separated by multiple strips.\nThe different cuts used in the analysis of the NCT flight\ndata are summarized in Table 1. After applying these\ndata selections, 65.8% of the remaining events had two\ninteractions, 25.9% had three interactions, 6.6% had four\ninteractions, and 1.7% had five or more.\n4. IMAGE OF THE CRAB NEBULA\n\nAfter applying the data cuts, an image was produced\nfrom the remaining data. Since NCT measures the\nlocation of the photon to a circle on the sky (not a\npoint), Compton imaging techniques are used to produce images. Compton imaging can be done through\nthe straightforward backprojection of Compton circles\nonto the sky or with more sophisticated image processing. One imaging tool that has been used for NCT data is\nList-Mode Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (MLEM) (Wilderman et al. 1998), which has been\nimplemented in MEGAlib (Zoglauer et al. 2010). This\nmethod is iterative, and it uses a maximum likelihood\nstatistic to refine the raw backprojection. The result is\nthat point sources become clearer and other features are\nsharpened.\nWe constructed an image from the NCT flight data\nusing the cuts mentioned previously. We plotted a total\nof 289,128 event circles in a 80\u25e6 \u00d7 80\u25e6 backprojection,\nof which approximately 3,800 event circles (1.3%) are\nexpected from the Crab based on simulations (see Section 5). We performed a total of five iterations of the\nMLEM algorithm on the image, which is the approximate number of iterations needed so that the FWHM\nof a point source image matches the 7.4\u25e6 ARM FWHM.\nThe result is that the Crab appears in the image (Fig. 1),\nthough it was not originally apparent in the backprojection (Fig. 2). The Sun was in the field of view but no\nsource appears there, as expected.\n\n\f4\n\nBandstra et al.\n\nThe Crab image reveals a slight offset (\u2248 2\u25e6 ) in the\nposition of the source. The significance of this offset\ncan be evaluated in the following manner. Given the\nequivalent gaussian sigma of the ARM histogram for\nthe Crab (7.4\u25e6 /2.35 = 3.1\u25e6 ) and the signal-to-noise estimate of 4\u03c3 (Section 7), the one-sigma uncertainty of\nthe image position can be estimated as \u2248 3.1\u25e6 /4 = 0.8\u25e6\n(e.g., Bobroff (1986)). This statistical uncertainty, combined with the \u2248 1\u25e6 systematic uncertainty in the gondola aspect, means the \u2248 2\u25e6 offset in the source position\nis not statistically significant.\n5. SIMULATION OF THE CRAB OBSERVATION\n\nA simulation of the Crab Nebula spectrum was performed as a point of comparison for the NCT flight\ndata. A detailed mass model for NCT has been developed, along with code that applies the detector response\nto the ideal simulated detector hits (Bandstra et al.\n2009; Chiu et al. 2009). The MEGAlib simulation tool\nCosima was used, which is based on the gamma-ray telescope library MEGAlib and the Monte Carlo framework\nGEANT4 (Agostinelli et al. 2003). A point source with\na spectrum identical to the Crab Nebula spectrum measured by INTEGRAL/SPI (Jourdain & Roques 2009)\nwas simulated at infinity along the z-axis of the detectors (i.e., the center of the field of view) for an equivalent real time of 100,000 seconds. The total Crab flux\nbetween 200 keV and 10 MeV was calculated to be\n2.194\u00d710\u22122 ph cm\u22122 s\u22121 . The total number of events between 200 keV and 10 MeV that interacted in the detectors were 219,987, with 18,622 events passing the event\ncuts (8.5%).\nCompensation for atmospheric absorption was done after the simulation by calculating the transmission probability as a function of energy and multiplying the probability with the spectrum of events that passed the data\ncuts. The more accurate way of accounting for atmospheric absorption is to perform Monte Carlo simulations\nwith a layer of air of the appropriate column density,\nbut a brief exploration of such simulations revealed that\nthere was little difference. An average column density\nof 3.2 g cm\u22122 was calculated for the chosen observation\ntime, and the Crab spectrum at 45\u25e6 , 55\u25e6 , 65\u25e6 , and 75\u25e6\nwas calculated (the Crab elevation peaks at 80\u25e6 at transit). An average spectrum was calculated, and it contained 71% of the total counts of the original spectrum.\nThis transmission percentage was used as an approximation for atmospheric absorption in the simulations.\n6. THE ANGULAR RESOLUTION MEASURE (ARM)\n\nAn important tool that will be used in the data analysis is the Compton telescope Angular Resolution Measure (ARM). The ARM is a statistic that is used to\nmeasure the angular resolution of a Compton telescope\n(e.g., Sch\u00f6nfelder et al. (1993)). An ARM histogram can\nbe constructed when the source's location is known. The\nARM histogram is a histogram of the following quantity:\n\u2206\u03c6ARM \u2261 \u03c6geo \u2212 \u03c6recon\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c6geo is the scatter angle derived from the known\nsource location and \u03c6recon is the Compton scatter angle\nobtained from event reconstruction (i.e., the Compton\nscatter formula). For a single event, \u2206\u03c6ARM measures\nthe deviation of the event's Compton circle from the true\n\nposition of the source. A graphical explanation of this\ndefinition is shown in Fig. 3. The angular resolution of a\nCompton telescope is specified by the full-width at half\nmaximum (FWHM) of the ARM histogram.\nThe FWHM of the ARM histogram is affected by\ndetector energy resolution, detector position resolution,\nand Doppler broadening. Doppler broadening is the deviation from the ideal Compton scatter formula caused\nby scattering off of bound atomic electrons (not free\nelectrons). It is a fundamental limit to the angular resolution of a Compton telescope. This broadening has been extensively studied for different materials in Zoglauer & Kanbach (2003). Because of NCT's\nexcellent energy resolution, the contribution from the\nenergy resolution is not important. The position resolution of the NCT detectors (especially the 2 mm\nstrip pitch) is the the dominant contribution to the\nARM (Bandstra et al. 2006). This is one reason the\nevent cut on the first interaction distance greatly improves the ARM FWHM.\nThe ARM is dominated by the distance between the\nfirst two interactions, because that vector forms the axis\nof the Compton circle. Subsequent scatters do not affect the ARM greatly; if anything, events with multiple\nCompton scatters have a narrower ARM. This can be\nunderstood by noting that in order to undergo further\nscatters, the photon must lose less energy in the first\nscatter. Thus the Compton scatter angle for these events\nmust be on average smaller, reducing the uncertainty in\nthe ARM.\nSince the position resolution of all the detectors is the\nsame (2 mm GeD strip pitch, and 0.5 mm depth resolution), and the GeD energy resolutions are similar ( 2\u2013\n4 keV FWHM at 662 keV), the ARM is uniform throughout the detectors. The ARM is predominantly affected\nby the geometry of the event. In fact, one can estimate\nNCT's ARM FWHM by using the requirement of at least\n1.2 cm between the first two scatters and the germanium\ndetector strip pitch of 2 mm. The FWHM should be\n0.2\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n1.2 =9.5 , which is comparable to the 12.8 measured\nfor the 662 keV calibration source and the 7.4\u25e6 measured for the Crab itself. By comparison, the contribution to the ARM due to the energy resolution (assuming\n\u25e6\n\u22483 keV FWHM) should be 511*3\n6622 =0.3 .\nThe ARM will be used to select events from the location of the Crab and test points. The ARM distribution\ncan usually be approximated by a Lorentzian distribution with FWHM \u0393, and the sensitivity of data cuts is\nmaximized by selecting events that are within 0.7\u0393 of the\ncenter. For the data cuts we are using, \u0393 = 7.4\u25e6 , so we\nuse an ARM cut of \u00b15.2\u25e6 to maximize sensitivity.\n7. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CRAB DETECTION\n\nTo measure the significance of the Crab, events that\nwere consistent with the Crab were extracted from the\ndata. Events whose Compton circles passed within the\noptimal ARM cut of 5.2\u25e6 around the position of the Crab\nwere selected.\nAn estimate of the background counts is needed to\ndetermine the significance. Because the Crab moves\nthrough NCT's wide field of view, we can select nearby\npoints to estimate the background at the Crab's position.\nAn added complication is that because photons are only\nlocalized to a circle, a photon from an off-source point\n\n\fDetection and Imaging of the Crab with NCT\n\n5\n\nImage - iteration: 5\n40\n\n30\n\n5000\n\nLatitude [deg]\n\n4500\n10\n\n0\n\n4000\nCrab\n\n-10\n\n3500\n-20\n\n-30\n\nSun\n\nIntensity [arbitrary units]\n\n20\n\n3000\n\n-40\n220\n\n210\n\n200\n\n190\n\n180\n\n170\n\n160\n\n150\n\n140\n\nLongitude [deg]\nFigure 1.

For this analysis, we selected eight points that were on a circle \u03b4 = 20\u25e6\naway from the Crab at evenly-spaced intervals. Events\nwere selected from within 5.2\u25e6 of these points. The angular separation of \u03b4 = 20\u25e6 was selected so that we could\nsample points that were close enough to the Crab that\nthey have similar exposure times, and far enough away\nso that fewer Compton circles would be consistent with\nboth the Crab and these points. There is a trade-off between choosing an offset angle \u03b4 so that the background\nestimate is reliable (i.e., \u03b4 should be small) and so that\nthe off-axis source contribution is small (i.e., \u03b4 should\nbe large). The value of 20\u25e6 was chosen in this work as\nthe largest angle such that the interval (\u2212\u03b4, +\u03b4) could\nbe sampled for the later ARM analysis (due to the 40\u25e6\nminimum elevation of the Crab).\nTable 2 shows the total number of events that were extracted from the on-source and the off-source positions.\nThe results of the same analysis on the Crab simulations\n(i.e., no background) are also shown in the table.

The difference of these two distributions is the\nsignature we expect in the flight data after estimating the ARM at\nnearby points.\n\nFigure 6.

The spectrum is measured by subtracting the average spectrum from eight\npoints 20\u25e6 away from each test point. The spectrum at the three\ntest points is consistent with zero.\n\nof \u03b4 = 20\u25e6 was chosen in this work as the largest angle\nsuch that the full interval (\u2212\u03b4, +\u03b4) could be sampled in\nthis analysis (due to the 40\u25e6 minimum elevation of the\nCrab). The ARM histogram was calculated for each of\nthose points, and the average was constructed.\nAn ARM histogram that is calculated at a point separated from a point source by an angle \u03b4 (20\u25e6 in this\ncase) will have an ARM histogram that no longer resembles a Lorentzian, but it is a mostly flat distribution\nbetween \u00b1\u03b4 that decays away beyond that region. So the\npoints we used to estimate the ARM have photons from\nthe Crab in them, and not an insignificant number. We\nmust account for the stray counts from the Crab in some\nway or risk underestimating the flux. An example of this\noff-source ARM contribution is shown in Fig. 7, where\nthe on-source Crab simulation is shown with the 20\u25e6 offsource Crab ARM. The difference between the on-source\nand off-source ARM histograms is the signature that we\nexpect to see in the flight data when subtracting background estimates that are an angle \u03b4 away from the Crab.\nThe difference between the ARM histogram at the\n\nFigure 8.

The result is shown in Fig. 8. The\nmeasured ARM excess is significant (P0 = 0.00025, or\n3.7\u03c3). The ARM distribution is also very close to the\nsimulated expectation (PCrab = 0.90). In addition, the\ncentral bin, which has the largest number of counts, has a\nsignal-to-noise ratio of 4.2\u03c3, similar to the overall source\nsignificance derived in Section 7. The expected simulation value for the central bin is 3.9\u03c3, so the simulations\nare in close agreement with the flight data.\nTo test the ARM analysis method, three other test\npoints were chosen that had similar exposure during the\nflight: (160\u25e6 , -10\u25e6 ), (170\u25e6 , +10\u25e6 ) and (175\u25e6 , +20\u25e6). Each\nof these points is consistent with the null hypothesis (the\nmaximum value of n0 is 1.6\u03c3) and inconsistent with the\nCrab simulation (the minimum value of nCrab is 2.2\u03c3).\nThe results are shown in Fig. 9.\n10. CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe Crab Nebula was detected by NCT at a significance of at least 4\u03c3 during 29.3 ks of observation time in\n\n\fDetection and Imaging of the Crab with NCT\n\n9\n\nto date (Vedrenne et al. 2003).\nThough NCT should be sensitive to the polarization of\ngamma-ray sources, a polarization analysis of the Crab\nwas not performed here due to the lack of sufficient\nstatistics. Recent gamma-ray observations have measured a high degree of polarization for the Crab Nebula:\n\u223c 45% in the 200\u2013800 keV (IBIS) and 100\u20131000 keV\n(SPI) regimes (Forot 2008; Dean 2008). Given this level\nof polarization, and the estimated instrumental modulation factor for NCT of 45% (Bellm et al. 2009b), the\nexpected polarization signal from the Crab should be\n\u223c 20% of the total signal. Therefore, with no other\nchanges to the NCT instrument, an increase in observation time by a factor of \u223c 25 would be needed to detect\nthe presence or absence of polarization at 4\u03c3 significance,\nand even more to measure the degree of polarization itself. Further collimation of the instrument could reduce\nthis time, at the cost of a reduced field of view.\nThe NCT instrument suffered extensive damage during\na launch attempt in Australia on a subsequent balloon\ncampaign. Once the instrument has been rebuilt, the\nfocus of future balloon flights is to perform polarization\nanalysis on point sources and to image extended sources\nsuch as the galactic 26 Al emission.\nThe NCT project is funded by NASA under Grant\n#NNG04WC38G for the NCT-US team and by the\nNational Space Organization (NSPO) in Taiwan under\nGrants 96-NSPO(B)-SP-FA04-01 and 98-NSPO-145 for\nthe NCT-Taiwan team. The team is grateful to Steve\nMcBride, Jane Hoberman, and C.-H. Lin for their design of the NCT electronics. We would also like to thank\nthe anonymous referee, whose comments greatly clarified\nthis paper.\nREFERENCES\nFigure 9. Measured ARM excess for three different test points,\nwith the expected excess for the actual Crab position shown. The\nspectrum is measured by subtracting the average spectrum from\neight points 20\u25e6 away from each test point. The ARM excess at\nthe three test points is consistent with zero.\n\nthe energy range 300\u20131500 keV. Compton events with\n2\u20137 individual photon interactions were used as long as\nthe interactions were well-separated in the germanium\ndetectors. Using image processing, the Crab appears in\na Compton image made from the data. Examination of\nthe spectrum and ARM histograms from the source are\nconsistent with Monte Carlo simulations of the Crab observation.\nThis result is the first significant detection of a celestial source by a CCT and is an important step in establishing the viability of the compact Compton telescope design for future space-based wide-survey instruments, such as the proposed Advanced Compton Telescope (e.g., Boggs et al. (2006)). In the case of ACT,\nthe improvement in efficiency and background rejection of the compact Compton telescope design is predicted to increase sensitivity by as many as two orders of magnitude over COMPTEL in a 106 s observation (Boggs et al. 2006). A similar improvement is predicted over INTEGRAL/SPI, a coded mask instrument\nthat is the most sensitive soft gamma-ray telescope flown\n\nAgostinelli, S., et al. 2003, Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys.
