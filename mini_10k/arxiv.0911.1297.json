Beyond the minimal assumption of a pure cosmological constant, two main approaches\nhave been explored. The first one consists in assuming some unknown form of matter, called dark energy, characterized\nby an equation of state P \u2243 \u2212\u03c1. The second approach is more radical, as it tries to explain the present observations\nas the manifestation of a modified theory of gravity, which mimicks general relativity on solar system scales, but\nsignificantly deviates from it on cosmological scales.\nIt turns out that it is rather difficult to construct a theory of gravity that, while being internally consistent,\ncan account for the cosmological observations and be compatible with the present gravity constraints deduced from\nlaboratory experiments and from solar and astrophysical systems. A class which has attracted a lot of attention is\nthe so-called f (R) gravity theories where the standard Einstein-Hilbert gravitational Lagrangian, proportional to the\nscalar curvature R, is replaced by a function of R while the matter part of the Lagrangian is left unchanged (see e.g.\n[1] for a recent review). After several detours, it has been realized that viable f (R) theories must satisfy stringent\nconditions in order to avoid instabilities and to satisfy the present laboratory and solar system constraints, and a few\nmodels have been carefully constructed to meet these requirements [2\u20134].\nTo explore the full viability of these theories, it is important to go one step further by studying their behaviour\nin the strong gravity regime, such as reigns in the core of the most relativistic stars, namely neutron stars. In this\ncontext, it has been claimed in [5, 6] that very relativistic stars do not exist in the models [2\u20134] because of the presence\nof an easily accessible singularity. In a recent work [7], we have shown that this claim does not hold by constructing\nnumerically static relativistic stars. Note that relativistic stars have also been studied in [8] but within different f (R)\nmodels.\nf (R) models can also be seen as a subclass of scalar-tensor theories. In particular, viable f (R) models rely on the\nso-called chameleon mechanism. For this reason, it is interesting to extend the study of relativistic stars to chameleon\nmodels. In this work, we show that the behaviour of chameleon and f (R) models is quite similar. In particular,\nin both cases, the scalar field in the innermost part of the star sticks to the minimum of its effective potential (if\nthis minimum exists). If the equation of state is such that \u03c1 \u2212 3P < 0, which occurs in the central part of highly\nrelativistic constant energy density stars, then there is no minimum. As we show here, it is nevertheless possible to\nconstruct numerically static stars, up to some critical value of the central energy density. We believe that this is due\nto tachyonic instabilities, associated with a negative effective squared mass, which develop and prevent the existence\nof a static star configuration. However, this problem does not apply to realistic neutron stars: although there is a\nlarge uncertainty on the equation of state deep inside a neutron star, the equations of state that have been proposed\nin the literature verify \u03c1 \u2212 3P > 0 throughout the star. To construct a simple approximation of a realistic neutron\nstar, we have used a polytropic equation of state.\n\n\f2\nAlthough, according to our previous work [7] and the present one, the singularity of the models [2\u20134] does not\nseem so far to be an obstacle for relativistic stars, it appears to be problematic for cosmology [5]. This has motivated\nthe construction of regularized versions of these models by adding for instance an extra R2 term [4, 9\u201312]. A more\nsophisticated model was also proposed recently in [13]. We will consider these \"cured\" f (R) theories and compare\ntheir behaviour in relativistic stars with their \"singular\" counterparts.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we derive the main equations governing static and spherically\nsymmetric configurations in scalar-tensor theories. Section III is devoted to relativistic stars in chameleon models.\nWe then consider, in Section IV, the f (R) models, including the \"cured\" models that have recently been introduced\nto solve the cosmological singularity problem of some of these models. We finally conclude in Section V.\nII.\n\nSTATIC AND SPHERICALLY SYMMETRIC EQUATIONS\n\nIn the present work, we consider models characterized by an action of the form\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\n1\nMP 2\n2\n4 \u221a\nS = d x \u2212g\nR \u2212 (\u2207\u03c6) \u2212 V (\u03c6) + Sm (\u03a8m ; g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd ) ,\n2\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwith MP2 \u2261 1/(8\u03c0G), and where the matter (i.e. the fields \u03a8m ) is minimally coupled to the metric\ng\u0303\u03bc\u03bd = \u03a92 (\u03c6)g\u03bc\u03bd .\nFor simplicity, we consider only couplings of the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c6\n\u03a9 = exp Q\n,\nMP\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Q is a constant, although more general functions can have interesting effects (such as the spontaneous scalarization dicovered in [14] for coupling functions of the form ln \u03a9 = \u03b2\u03c62 /2 with \u03b2 < 0).\nViable scalar-tensor theories are severely restricted by the present constraints on gravity, coming from laboratory\nexperiments, solar system and binary pulsar tests. For example, deviations from General Relativity (GR) can be\nparametrized by the post-Netwonian parameters (\u03b2\u0303 \u2212 1) and (\u03b3\u0303 \u2212 1). For the coupling (2), one finds (see e.g. [15]1 )\n\u03b2\u0303 \u2212 1 = 0,\n\n\u03b3\u0303 \u2212 1 = \u22124\n\nQ2\n.\n1 + 2Q2\n\nThe present constraint, inferred from solar system tests, is [16]\n| \u03b3\u0303 \u2212 1 |. 2 \u00d7 10\u22125 .\nThe binary pulsars also give a similar constraint, but which is so far weaker than the solar system constraint in our\ncase2 . The above constraint suggests that scalar tensor theories of gravity can be viable only for very small couplings\nbetween ordinary matter and the scalar field.\nHowever, this constraint can be evaded if the scalar field is endowed with a potential such that its effective mass\nbecomes large in the presence of matter. This is the so-called chameleon effect [18, 19]. As a consequence of this\neffect, the \"bare\" coupling constant Q is replaced by an effective coupling Qeff which can be strongly suppressed,\ni.e. such that |Qeff | \u226a |Q|. The purpose of this paper is to study relativistic stars in this type of\u221agravity. This also\napplies to f (R) theories, which can be recast in the form of scalar tensor theories with Q = \u22121/ 6, leading to the\nunacceptable value \u03b3\u0303 = 1/2 [20]. Therefore, these theories can be considered as viable if the corresponding potential\nallows for a chameleon effect [21\u201323].\n\n1\n2\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\nNote that our \u03c6 is related to the scalar field \u03c6 defined in [15] by \u03c6 = 2MP \u03c6 and therefore their \u03b1 corresponds to \u03b1 = 2Q.\nThis can be seen on the figure 11 of the very recent lecture notes by G. Esposito-Farese [17]. For models with a coupling of the form (2),\nthe parameter space is restricted to the vertical axis \u03b20 = 0 where, so far, the solar system constraints turn out to be more stringent.\n\n\f3\nA.\n\nLinks between the Jordan and Einstein frames\n\nThe action (1) is defined in the Einstein frame, where gravity is described by the usual Einstein-Hilbert term for\nthe metric g\u03bc\u03bd . This metric differs from the metric g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd , defined in the Jordan frame, which is directly felt by the\nmatter. As a consequence, one must be careful to specify the metric with respect to which various quantities are\ndefined. For example, the energy-momentum tensor, defined in the Jordan frame and denoted T\u0303\u03bc\u03bd , is related to the\nenergy-momentum tensor defined in the Einstein frame, T\u03bc\u03bd , by\nT\u0303\u03bd\u03bc = \u03a9\u22124 T\u03bd\u03bc ,\nso that, for a perfect fluid, we have\n\u03c1 = \u03a94 \u03c1\u0303,\n\nP = \u03a94 P\u0303 .\n\nThe equation of state will always be specified in the Jordan frame.

As we will see later, the sign of\n\u03c1 \u2212 3P is crucial to understand the behaviour of the scalar field inside the star and can have drastic implications\nconcerning the stability of the scalar field. Note that this critical value was also pointed out in [24]. Note also that\nalthough our derivation above applies only to constant energy density stars in pure general relativity, it remains a\ngood approximation for the stars we consider because the backreaction of the scalar field on the star profile is very\nsmall.\n\n\f5\nD.\n\nMore realistic equation of state\n\nAlthough analytically simple, a constant energy density star is not a very realistic substitute for a real neutron star.\nSince the equation of state deep inside a neutron star is still unknown, we use in this paper a polytropic equation of\nstate, which remains simple and is believed to represent a reasonable approximation for a real neutron star. Following\n[25] we use,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u00f12\n\u00f12\n, P\u0303 (\u00f1) = KmB ,\n(11)\n\u03c1\u0303(\u00f1) = mB \u00f1 + K\nn0\nn0\nwith mB = 1.66 \u00d7 10\u221227 kg, n0 = 0.1 fm\u22123 and K = 0.1.

In general relativity, the\nnumerical integration of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equations leads to a star, which is stable, with a global\nmass M = 3.10M\u2299 and a gravitational potential |\u03a6\u2217 | \u2243 0.21. In both the chameleon and f (R) models, we will use\nthe same equation of state with the same central density and will find that the star configuration is almost identical\nto the general relativistic one.\nIn Fig. 1, we plot the radial profile of the energy density and of the pressure. As can be seen in the same figure,\nthe quantity \u03c1\u0303 \u2212 3P\u0303 remains positive throughout the star. The same holds for other realistic equations of state that\nhave been proposed in the literature (see e.g. [26] and references therein for a discussion on the equations of state of\nneutron stars). Interestingly, \u03c1\u0303 \u2212 3P\u0303 is not a monotonous function of the radius in the example we have chosen. We\nwill see that this has a visible influence on the profile of the scalar field inside the star.\nE.\n\nEffective potential\n\nAssuming some configuration for the relativistic star and ignoring any backreaction of the scalar field on this\nconfiguration, it is useful to interpret the right hand side of the Klein-Gordon equation (7), up to the metric component\ne\u03bb , as the derivative of an effective potential defined by\n1\nVeff = V + \u03a94 (\u03c1\u0303 \u2212 3P\u0303 ).\n4\n\n(12)\n\n\f6\nConsequently, a local extremum of the potential is characterized by the condition\ndV\nQ 4Q\u03c6/MP\ndVeff\n(\u03c1\u0303 \u2212 3P\u0303 ) = 0.\ne\n=\n+\nd\u03c6\nd\u03c6\nMP\n\n(13)\n\nA solution of the above equation, if it exists, corresponds to a minimum of the potential if the effective squared mass\nm2eff \u2261\n\nd2 Veff\nd2 V\nQ2 4Q\u03c6/MP\n(\u03c1\u0303 \u2212 3P\u0303 )\ne\n=\n+4\n2\n2\nd\u03c6\nd\u03c6\nMP 2\n\nis positive. It is thus manifest that the quantity \u03c1\u0303\u22123P\u0303 plays a crucial r\u00f4le in the overall sign of m2eff , with consequences\nfor the stability of the star, which we discuss just below.\nF.\n\nStability\n\nAlthough the study of the stability of our star configurations would require a detailed analysis, which we leave\nfor future work, one can try to discuss this issue with some qualitative arguments. For simplicity, we ignore the\nperturbations of the star matter and of the scalar field and consider only the perturbations of the scalar field about\nthe background configuration. Decomposing these perturbations into spherical harmonics,\nX\n\u03b4\u03c6(t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) =\n\u03b4\u03c6lm (t, r)Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6),\none finds that each mode verifies the equation\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u2032\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0015\n\u0013\n\u03bd \u2212 \u03bb\u2032\n2\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03bd\u2212\u03bb\n\u03bd l(l + 1)\n2\n \u0308\n\u03b4\u03c6 +\n\u03b4\u03c6 \u2212 e\n\u03b4\u03c6 + e\n+ meff \u03b4\u03c6 = 0.\n+\n2\nr\nr2\n\nwhere m2eff has been defined in (14). Using a Fourier decomposition in time, and denoting the frequency \u03c9, the above\nequation of motion leads to a dispersion relation of the form\n\u03c9 2 \u2243 k 2 + m2eff ,\nwhere k \u22121 is the typical lengthscale of variation of the scalar field. One can write k = \u03b1r\u2217\u22121 , where \u03b1 is typically\nbigger than 1 but not very much, in the situations we consider. Let us also assume that the dominant contribution\nto m2eff comes from the matter part. Concentrating on the radial modes (which are potentially more dangerous), we\nfind that the configuration is stable if,\n\u03c92 \u2243\n\n\u03b12\nQ2\n+ 4 2 \u03c1\u0303\u2217 (1 \u2212 3w) > 0,\n2\nr\u2217\nMP\n\nwhere\nw \u2261 P\u0303 /\u03c1\u0303.\nSubstituting \u03c1\u0303\u2217 \u223c M\u2217 /r\u22173 and \u03a6\u2217 \u223c M\u2217 /(MP 2 r\u2217 ) leads to the condition\n(1 \u2212 3w)\u03a6\u2217 & \u22121,\nwhere the right hand side is some constant, but typically of order \u22121. According to this relation, obtained in a very\ncrude way, one expects instabilities to appear whenever the equation of state is such that 1 \u2212 3w < 0 and the star is\nvery compact so that \u03a6\u2217 is a significant fraction of one. This is precisely the situation which one encounters for very\nmassive stars with constant energy density, where w > 1/3 in the central region.\nG.\n\nNumerical procedure\n\nWe now present how we proceed numerically. As a fist step, it is convenient to rescale the various quantities involved\nand to work directly with dimensionless quantities. Let us thus introduce the following rescaled variables\nr = r0 \u03be,\n\n\u03c6 = M0 \u03c6\u0302,\n\nV =\n\nM02\nV\u0302 ,\nr02\n\n\u03c1\u0303 =\n\nM12\n\u03c1\u0302,\nr02\n\nP\u0303\u2217 =\n\nM12\nP\u0302 ,\nr02\n\n(14)\n\n\f7\nwhere r0\u22121 , M0 , M1 are parameters of dimension of mass, which are so far arbitrary.

They are chosen purely for convenience. In the\nfollowing, we will take \u01eb1 = 1 in all cases, but our choice for \u01eb0 will be different for chameleon models and for f (R)\ngravity.\nMeanwhile the equation of state (8) transforms into\nP\u0302 = P\u0302 (\u03c1\u0302).\n\n(16)\n\u22121/2\n\nFor the polytropic equation of state Eq.(11), with \u00f1c = 0.3 fm\u22123 , we will always choose r0 = MP \u03c1\u0303c\n\u03c1\u0302c = 1\n\n, so that\n\n(polytropic star).\n\nThe equation of state Eq.(11) then becomes, in these rescaled units,\ns\n\u00112\nP\u0302\n1 \u0010p\n1 + 1.56\u03c1\u0302 \u2212 1 ,\n\u03c1\u0302 = P\u0302 +\n\u21d0\u21d2\nP\u0302 =\n0.39\n1.56\n\n(17)\n\nwith the rescaled central pressure P\u0302c \u2243 0.23. Since the neutron star is a highly relativistic object, this choice entails\nthat the radius of the star in rescaled units is of order one, \u03be\u2217 \u2261 r\u2217 /r0 \u223c 1.\nSince we study static configurations, a natural way to proceed with numerics is to use a relaxation algorithm. In\nthe following calculations the relaxation parameter will be taken to vary with the iteration number (typically between\n10\u22123 and 1), in order to ensure the convergence of the algorithm and to minimize the number of iterations. We\nhave used a non-homogenous grid, usually between 1000 and 6000 points. The details of the grid depend on the\nmodel under consideration and its parameters. Normally the grid is chosen so that the points of the grid are highly\nconcentrated in the particular region inside the star where the solution varies rapidly. Such a choice of inhomogeneous\ngrid allows us to numerically resolve potentially problematic regions.\nLet us finally discuss the boundary conditions. The system (15), which includes three first-order differential equations and one second-order differential equation, requires five boundary conditions. Some of them are defined at the\ncenter of the star, at \u03be = 0, while the remaining ones are specified far from the star, at some point \u03be = \u03be2 . The\nboundary conditions for the metric components and the scalar field are\nM\u0302(0) = 0,\n\n\u03bd(\u03be2 ) = 0,\n\n\u03c6\u0302\u2032 (0) = 0,\n\n\u03c6\u0302(\u03be2 ) = \u03c6\u0302\u221e .\n\n(18)\n\nThe boundary conditions for M\u0302 and \u03c6\u0302 at the center just follow from the requirement of regularity at \u03be = 0. The\ncondition on \u03bd is in fact arbitrary, since only \u03bd \u2032 enters (15) but not \u03bd itself: our choice corresponds to defining the time\ncoordinate as the proper time of a static observer at \u03be2 . The \"asymptotic\" value \u03c6\u0302\u221e corresponds to the minimum of\nthe effective potential V\u0302eff far from the star3 . Finally, the boundary condition for the pressure is\nP\u0302 (0) = P\u0302c\n\n3\n\nor P\u0302 (\u03be2 ) = P\u0302\u221e ,\n\nSome situations require a more precise boundary condition, in which case the exact value of \u03c6 at \u03be2 can be deduced from the asymptotic\nbehaviour of the scalar field at large distances, which can be computed analytically.\n\n\f8\ndepending on the problem: for a constant-density star it is convenient to choose P\u0302 (\u03be2 ) = \u2212\u03c1\u0302\u221e so that the solution is\nasymptotically de Sitter, while for the polytropic equation state, the pressure at the origin is fixed4 .\nIII.\nA.\n\nCHAMELEON\n\nDescription of the models\n\nIn this section we consider chameleon scalar-tensor theories, introduced in [18, 19]. In these models, the effective\nmass of the scalar field becomes important inside matter so that the usual constraints on fifth-force interactions are\nevaded. To illustrate the behaviour of a chameleon field in a relativistic star, we will concentrate on a specific model,\nbut our results should remain qualitatively valid for other models.\nWe will consider the action (1) with the potential\nV (\u03c6) =\n\n\u03bc5\n,\n\u03c6\n\nwhere \u03bc is a mass parameter. We will also assume that Q is positive. Moreover, as in the original proposal for the\nchameleon [18, 19], we will use Q \u223c 1 and \u03bc \u223c 10\u22123 eV (this value corresponds to an upper bound for \u03bc in order to\nsatisfy the equivalence principle constraints [18]).\nIf Q\u03c6/MP \u226a 1, which will be true for our configurations, the scalar field value corresponding to the minimum of\nthe effective potential (12) is given by\ns\nM P \u03bc5\n\u03c6min =\n.\nQ(\u03c1\u0303 \u2212 3P\u0303 )\nNote that this is defined only if \u03c1\u0303 \u2212 3P\u0303 > 0. Therefore, there is no local minimum at the center of a constant energy\ndensity star with \u03a6\u2217 > 5/18.\nFor our numerical study, we have chosen \u01eb0 such that the asymptotic value of the scalar field is normalized to a\nvalue of order unity. More precisely, we take 5\ns\n\u03bc5\n\u01eb0 =\nQMP \u03c1\u0303\u221e\nwhere \u03c1\u0303\u221e is the asymptotic energy density, so that the local minimum is given by\nr\n\u03c1\u221e\n\u03c6\u0302min =\n,\n(1 \u2212 3w)\u03c1\n\u221a\nin rescaled units. Asymptotically, one thus finds \u03c6\u0302\u221e = 1/ 1 \u2212 3w\u221e = 1/2 (for w\u221e = \u22121).\nAs for the parameter r0 , it is convenient to choose it of the order of the star radius. In the case of the polytropic\n\u22121/2\nequation of state, we take r0 = MP \u03c1\u0303c\n, so that \u03c1\u0302c = 1, as mentioned earlier. For the constant energy density stars,\nwe will adopt the same prescription for a reference star characterized by \u03a6\u2217 = 0.165. We will then compare this star\nto other stars, with the same radius but different central densities, by keeping r0 fixed but by allowing the rescaled\ncentral density \u03c1\u0302c to vary.\nThe rescaled potential can be written in the form\nV\u0302 =\n\nv0\n\u03c6\u0302\n\n,\n\nv0 =\n\nQ\n\u03c1\u0302\u221e .\n\u01eb0\n\n(19)\n\nIn rescaled units, taking \u01eb1 = 1, the effective potential is thus\nV\u0302eff =\n\n4\n5\n\nv0\n\u03c6\u0302\n\n+\n\n1 4Q\u01eb0 \u03c6\u0302\n(\u03c1\u0302 \u2212 3P\u0302 ).\ne\n4\u01eb20\n\n(20)\n\nIn this case we also obtain asymptotically de Sitter solution.\nAny other choice is acceptable, but not so well adapted for numerics. For example, the choice \u01eb0 = 1 leads to values of the rescaled\nscalar field that are very small fractions of unity, which is not very convenient for the numerical investigation.\n\n\f9\nwhile the corresponding effective squared mass is\nm\u03022eff =\n\n2v0\n\u03c6\u03023min\n\n+ 4Q2 e4Q\u01eb0 \u03c6\u0302min (\u03c1\u0302 \u2212 3P\u0302 ).\n\n(21)\n\nLet us estimate the order of magnitude of the above parameters. A typical value for the density inside neutron\nstars is \u03c1c \u223c 1015 g/cm3 , whereas the asymptotic density is \u03c1\u221e \u223c 10\u221224 g/cm3 , corresponding to the galactic density.\nWith Q \u223c 1 and \u03bc \u223c 10\u22123 eV, this leads to tiny values for our dimensionless parameters: \u01eb0 \u223c 10\u221219 and v0 \u223c 10\u221221 .\nThese realistic parameters are too small for the numerical precision that can be reached in practice and we have used\nparameters that are much bigger.\n1.4\n\n1.2\n\n1.0\n\nV\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n\u03a6\nFIG. 2: The rescaled bare potentials (19), shown by solid blue, the matter part of the effective potential, shown by dashed red,\nand the effective potential for the chameleon model (20), shown by dotted black line.

In a realistic context, the star configuration should be matched asymptotically to a\ncosmological geometry, which is time dependent. Since we restrict our analysis to purely static configurations, we\nintroduce instead some artificial matter which behaves like a cosmological constant far from the star. At large radius,\nthe geometry thus approaches a Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric, which is static. We have checked that the details of the\nasymptotic matter do not modify the star configuration. Another possibility would be to introduce some non-trivial\nminimum in the chameleon potential.\n1.\n\nConstant energy density stars\n\nAs a first (toy) example we considered a constant energy density star. In order to avoid unnecessary numerical\ndifficulties connected with a sharp transition of the density from the star to the surrounding medium, we introduced\nthe following smoothed profile for the density:\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u03be\u22121\n\u03c1\u0302c\n1 \u2212 tanh\n+ \u03c1\u0302\u221e ,\n(23)\n\u03c1\u0302(\u03be) =\n2\n\u03c3\n\nwhere \u03c1\u0302c is the rescaled density at the center of the star, \u03c1\u0302\u221e is the density of the surrounding medium far from the\nstar and \u03c3 is a \"smoothing\" parameter (with values between 10\u221212 and 10\u22122 ). It is easy to see, that for small enough\n\u03c3 the density is approximately equal to \u03c1\u0302c for \u03be . 1 and \u03c1\u0302 \u2243 \u03c1\u0302\u221e for \u03be & 1, so that \u03be \u2243 1 is the radius of the star.\nThe boundary condition for the pressure is, P\u0302 (\u03be2 ) = \u2212\u03c1\u0302\u221e , so that we ensure that the de Sitter asymptotic behaviour\nis recovered for our numerical solution. In this case the pressure is found as a function of \u03be, and P\u0302 inside the star\ndepends on the boundary condition \u03be2 . This seemingly paradoxical situation is due to the artificial choice (23), but,\nas we have checked, the effect is tiny because the ratio between the star energy density and the asymptotic one is\nhuge.\nFor a given coupling Q, the numerical system depends on three independent parameters: \u03c1\u0302c , v0 and \u01eb0 , while\n\u03c6\u0302\u221e = 1/2 and the rescaled asymptotic density \u03c1\u221e is determined by \u03c1\u0302\u221e = v0 \u01eb0 /Q according to (19). Since the\nbackreaction of the scalar field on the star itself is very small, the compactness of the star depends only on the\nparameter \u03c1\u0302c . Consequently, for fixed parameters v0 and \u01eb0 , increasing the central density leads to stars that are\nmore and more compact, and therefore more and more relativistic. In Fig. 3, we plot the profile of the scalar field\nfor stars with different central densities, corresponding to a gravitational potential ranging from 0.00168 to 0.165.\nAs the central density increases, one sees how the scalar field profile evolves from a smooth configuration to a thin\nshell configuration, where the scalar field abruptly jumps within a small range of radii. This is in agreement with the\nNewtonian result [19] that \u2206r/r\u2217 \u2248 (\u03c6\u221e \u2212 \u03c6c )/(6QMP \u03a6\u2217 ) \u2248 \u01eb0 /(12Q\u03a6\u2217 ).\nEssentially the thin-shell solution can be understood as follows. The solution tries to minimize the sum of the\npotential energy and of the gradient energy, with the constraints that \u03c6\u2032 = 0 at r = 0 and \u03c6 fixed asymptotically. As\nthe energy density in the star increases, to be away from the minimum of the effective potential becomes very costly\nenergetically and, therefore, the field prefers to stay as much as possible close to its minimum. At some point close\nto the star radius, however, the field starts to move away from its effective minimum. In this region, the contribution\nfrom the potential on the right hand side of the Klein-Gordon equation becomes negligible with respect to the matter\ndependent term, and the field \"evolves\" very quickly, driven by this \"matter force\" term. In the relativistic regime,\nanalytical expressions describing the profile of the scalar field in the thin shell regime have been obtained in [27]: they\napply to constant energy density stars and in the linearized approximation for the gravitational potential.\nIf one continues to increase the central energy density of the star, one ends up reaching the critical value for which\n\u03c1\u0302 \u2212 3P\u0302 < 0 in the innermost central region of the star. The profile of the scalar field in the central region of the star is\nthen radically altered, as one can see on Fig. 4, because there is no local minimum for the scalar field in this region.\n2.\n\nThin shell effect\n\nIt is also instructive to see how much, depending on the density of the star, the geometry outside the star is close\nto that expected in general relativity. Numerically, one can estimate the post-Newtonian parameter \u03b3\u0303 by comparing\nthe coefficients of the terms in 1/r in the metric components g\u0303tt and g\u0303rr .\nSince we work in the Einstein frame, let us first discuss the metric components gtt and grr . One subtlety here is that\nthe metric is asymptotically Schwarzschild-de Sitter rather than simply Schwarzschild and the asymptotic behaviours\nof the metric components are therefore\ne\u03bd \u2248 e\u2212\u03bb \u2248 1 \u2212\n\n2GM\n\u039b\n\u2212 r2 .\nr\n3\n\n(24)\n\n\f11\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n\u03a6\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nr\nFIG. 3: Profiles of the scalar field \u03c6 (in Planck units) as a function of radius of the star (in units of r0 = MP \u03c1\u0302c \u03c1\u0303c 1/2 ) for constant\ndensity stars with the equation of state (23). The parameters are chosen as follows, \u03c3 = 0.01, Q = \u01eb1 = 1, \u01eb0 = v0 = 0.01, and\nthe rescaled densities of the star are (from light gray to black), \u03c1\u0302c = 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 1. The values of the gravitational potential\nat the surface of the star are, respectively, 0.00168, 0.00334, 0.0083 and 0.165. The increasing rescaled density corresponds to\nan increasing physical density while the physical radius of the star is being fixed.\n\nTo estimate M numerically, we have substracted from the metric components the cosmological constant term with\n\u039b = \u03c1\u221e e4Q\u03c6\u221e /MP + V\u221e ,\nwhere \u03c6\u221e is the asymptotic minimum of the scalar field and V\u221e \u2261 V (\u03c6\u221e ). We have checked that the two metric\ncomponents, in the Einstein frame, provide the same value M . This means, in particular, that the backreaction due\nto the scalar field gradient is negligible outside the star.\nIn the Jordan frame, the metric components are g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd = exp(2Q\u03c6/MP )g\u03bc\u03bd . The asymptotic behaviour of the scalar\nfield is of the form\n\u03c6 \u2248 \u03c6\u221e + 2\n\nGM\nQeff e\u2212meff r ,\nr\n\nwhere Qeff is the effective coupling of the scalar field to the star, which is strongly suppressed in the thin shell regime.\nCombining this expression with (24), it is easy to get\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u039b 2\nGM\n2Q\u03c6\u221e\n\u2212 r ,\n1 \u2212 2 (1 \u2212 2QQeff )\ng\u0303tt \u2248 e\nr\n3\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u039b 2\nGM\n\u22121\n\u22122Q\u03c6\u221e\n\u2212 r ,\n1 \u2212 2 (1 + 2QQeff )\ng\u0303rr \u2248 e\nr\n3\nwhere, for simplicity, we have neglected the exponential decay.

This is illustrated in Fig. 5, where we have estimated numerically the\neffective coupling Qeff as well as the post-Newtonian parameter \u03b3\u0303 for stars with increasing energy density.\n\n\f12\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n\u03a6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\nr\nFIG. 4: Profiles of the scalar field \u03c6 (in Planck units) as a function of radius of the star (in units of r0 = MP \u03c1\u0302c \u03c1\u0303c 1/2 ) for stars\nwith \u03c1\u0303 \u2212 3P\u0303 < 0 in the central region.

Although this particular equation\nof state is appropriate for the bulk of the star, it must be slightly modified at the edge of the star for the following\nreasons. First of all, the equation of state (17) does not describe the exterior of the star. However, in the case of\nthe chameleon field it is crucial to have a non-zero background density, therefore for small densities Eq. (17) must\nbe changed to include the background (galactic or extragalactic) matter in the model. Moreover Eq. (17) leads to a\nproblematic behavior in the limit \u03c1 \u2192 0 (i.e. at the edge of the star), where the equation of state becomes P\u0302 \u221d \u03c1\u03022 .\nIn this case, the relativistic Euler equation become ill-defined. One can also see this problem when describing the\ndynamics of a perfect fluid with P\u0302 \u221d \u03c1\u03022 in terms of a scalar field: the emergent metric for perturbations becomes\nsingular when \u03c1\u0302 \u2192 0, as it is explained in detail in [28]. We choose the following modification of the equation of state\n(17),\n\u03c1\u0302 = P\u0302 +\n\nP\u0302 + \u03c1\u0302\u221e\n0.39\n\n!1/2\n\n,\n\n(26)\n\nwhere we have introduced the (rescaled) asymptotic energy density \u03c1\u0302\u221e , which is an extremely small parameter with\nrespect to the pressure and energy density in the star. It should be stressed for P\u0302 & \u03c1\u0302\u221e the modified equation of\nstate (26) takes the original form of the equation of state (17), while for small P\u0302 the modified equation of state allows\nfor the cosmological term behavior 6 . Thus the modification of the equation of state only affects a tiny region at the\nedge of the star. We also tried other modifications for the equation of state, and we obtained the same results, up to\nsmall differences around the edge of the star, as expected. It is easy to see that for small \u03c1\u0302\u221e the \"fluid\" (26) is in the\nregime of a cosmological constant when \u2212P\u0302 = \u03c1\u0302 \u2243 \u03c1\u0302\u221e .\n\n6\n\nIn fact, our numerical integration shows that the system settles down at the cosmological term, P\u0302 = \u2212\u03c1\u0302, at large \u03be.\n\n\f13\nHaving specified the equation of state for the star and the surrounding matter (26), we also need to fix the boundary\nconditions. Apart from the four usual conditions (18), the boundary condition on the pressure is specified at the center\nof the star: P\u0302 (0) \u2243 0.23 (which corresponds to a realistic value, in the rescaled units). It is interesting to note, that the\nsystem \"chooses\" by itself the cosmological term-like behavior asymptotically, P\u0302 = \u2212\u03c1\u0302, we do require any conditions\non the density nor the pressure at infinity. This situation is in contrast to the constant density star configuration,\nwhere we imposed the \"correct\" asymptotic behavior at infinity specifying the boundary condition for P\u0302 .\nThe numerical solution for the scalar field profile is shown in Fig. 6 for the parameters Q = \u01eb1 = 1, \u01eb0 = 0.01,\nv0 = 0.01, \u03c10 = 10\u22124 . The minimum of the effective potential is indicated by a dashed line. In the central part of the\nstar, the scalar field strictly follows this minimum. Note that, as the radius increases, the minimum first increases and\nthen decreases. This non-monotonous evolution is the consequence of the non-monotonous evolution of the quantity\n\u03c1\u0303 \u2212 3P\u0303 , which was pointed previously. Slightly before reaching the radius of the star (delimited by the quasi-vertical\ndashed line), the scalar field starts to move away from its minimum, with a steep gradient, and asymptotically evolves\ntoward its asymptotic minimum far from the star. We have also studied numerically configurations with other sets of\nparameters, namely in the range \u01eb0 \u223c 0.1 \u2212 10\u22123 , v0 \u223c 0.1 \u2212 10\u22123 , \u03c10 \u223c 10\u22122 \u2212 10\u22124 , and found a similar behaviour,\nwhile the value of the scalar field at the center of the star agrees with the estimate (22).\nAs mentioned earlier, the profiles for the energy density and pressure of the star are almost unchanged with respect\nto those for the corresponding star in pure general relativity (i.e. without scalar field), presented in Fig. 1. This can\nbe understood by noting that the contribution of the scalar field in the first three equations (15) can be neglected,\ngiving then the same equations as in general relativity. The change in the total neutron star mass is less than one\npercent.\nIV.\n\nf (R) GRAVITY\n\nWe now turn to f (R) gravity, restricting ourselves to the conventional metric formulation. Some of our results on\nrelativistic stars have already appeared in a separate publication [7].

It is convenient to reexpress f in the form\nf (R\u0303) = R0 F (x),\n\nx\u2261\n\nR\u0303\nR0\n\nwhere F is a dimensionless function and R0 is some parameter.\nIn contrast with many papers on f (R) theories, in particular [5] and [6], we choose here to reexpress the model\nas a scalar- tensor theory in the so-called Einstein frame. The two formulations are of course equivalent (at least at\nthe classical level), but the Einstein frame is useful to compare directly the behaviour of f (R) theories with that of\nchameleon models, discussed in the previous section.\nBy introducing the scalar field\nr\nr\n3\n3\nMP ln f,R\u0303 =\nMP ln F \u2032 (x)\n(28)\n\u03c6=\n2\n2\nand the metric\ng\u03bc\u03bd = \u03a9\n\n\u22122\n\ng\u0303\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n\u03a9\n\n\u22122\n\n= f,R\u0303 = exp[\n\nthe action (27) can be reexpressed in the form (1) with the coupling\n\u221a\nQ = \u22121/ 6,\n\nr\n\n2\n\u03c6/MP ]\n3\n\n\f15\nand the potential\nV = MP2\n\nR\u0303f,R\u0303 \u2212 f\n2f,2R\u0303\n\n,\n\n(29)\n\nwhich can be expressed in terms of \u03c6 by inverting the definition (28) of \u03c6 as a function of R\u0303.\nNote that, in contrast to the chameleon case discussed in the previous section, the coupling Q is here negative.\nWe could have chosen a positive value by changing the sign of \u03c6, but we have kept the usual convention. When\ncomparing the results of this section with the previous one, it is useful to keep in mind that the signs of Q and \u03c6 can\nbe simultaneously changed.\n1.08\n\n1.06\n\nsingularity\n1.04\n\nV\n1.02\n\n1.00\n\nde Sitter\nattractor\n0.98\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.2\n\n0.0\n\n-0.1\n\n\u03a6\nFIG. 7: Potential V (in units of MP2 R0 ) as a function of \u03c6 (in Planck units) for n = 1 and x\u221e = 3.6.

It is instructive to\nconsider the asymptotic expansion of the potential and its derivatives in order to understand intuitively the behaviour\nof the scalar field, noting that the infinite curvature limit corresponds to \u03c6 \u2192 0\u2212 .\nUsing the asymptotic expansion\nF (x) \u2243 x \u2212 \u03bb + \u03bbx\u22122n ,\n\n(x \u226b 1),\n\n(31)\n\n\f16\none finds\nV(x) \u2261\n\nV\nMP2 R0\n\n\u2243\n\n\u0003\n\u03bb\u0002\n1 \u2212 (1 + 2n)x\u22122n ,\n2\n\nwhich shows that the amplitude of the potential remains finite when x \u226b 1, i.e. when \u03c6 approaches 0. This is\nquite different from the chameleon model discussed in the previous section and this can cause some worry that the\nsingularity can be easily accessible for high enough curvatures, as discussed in [5].\nHowever, the derivative of the potential still goes to infinity in this limit and this property prevents the scalar field\nto reach the singularity. Indeed, the derivative of the effective potential is given by (see appendix)\nr\ndVeff\nx\n1\n2\n(\u03c1\u0303 \u2212 3P\u0303 ),\n\u2243\nMP R0 \u2212 \u221a\nd\u03c6\n3\n2\n6 MP\nwhich implies the existence of a minimum\nxmin \u2243\n\n\u221a\n\u22122n\u22121\n\u03c6min = \u2212 6\u03bbnxmin\n.\n\n\u03c1\u0303 \u2212 3P\u0303\n,\nMP 2 R0\n\n(32)\n\nat least if the matter term \u03c1\u0303 \u2212 3P\u0303 is positive. It can be checked that this is indeed a minimum by computing the\nsecond derivative of the effective potential. This leads to a positive effective square mass (see appendix),\nm2eff \u2243 R0\n\nx2n+2\nmin\n,\n6\u03bbn(2n + 1)\n\nwhich becomes very large at high curvature.\nAs the energy density in the star increases toward the center, one expects that the scalar field will be closer and\ncloser to the singularity (without reaching it however), simply because the minimum of the effective potential is closer\nand closer to the singularity. This is confirmed by our numerical calculations, which we dicuss below.\nC.\n\nNumerical results\n\nWe have integrated numerically the system of equations (15), together with (11), for Starobinsky's model (30) with\nn = 1. Our parameters are \u01eb0 = \u01eb1 = 1 and the rescaled potential is\nV\u0302 = v0 V ,\n\nv0 = r02 R0 =\n\nMP2 R0\n,\n\u03c1\u0303c\n\nwhere the explicit expression for V in the case n = 1 is given by (A6) in the appendix.\nHere, the parameter v0 corresponds to the ratio between the energy density at infinity (i.e. the cosmological energy\ndensity) and the energy density at the center of the star. Realistic values of this parameter are thus extremely\nsmall, typically v0 \u223c 10\u221240 , and are numerically challenging to reach, because the scalar field value at the center is\nproportional to v03 , as can be seen by comparing the definition of v0 with the minimum defined in (32) in the case\nn = 1. We have performed our numerical calculations in the range v0 \u223c 10\u22121 \u2212 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 and checked that the solution\nat the center behaves as expected from our analytical analysis, Eq. (32). We are thus confident that this should hold\nfor smaller values of v0 . As in the case of the chameleon model, the profiles for the density and pressure only slightly\ndiffer from the GR results.\nThe profile of the scalar field inside and outside the star is plotted in Fig. 8. As is clear from the figure, the scalar\nfield tends to interpolate between an extremely high density regime, inside the star, and a very low density regime,\noutside the star. This behaviour is quite analogous to that of the chameleon model discussed in the previous section\nand the solution that we obtain is analogous to the thin-shell solution. What differs from the usual chameleon models\nis the presence of the singularity. In the very high density regime, the scalar field is very close to the singularity\nbecause the minimum of the effective potential is itself very close to the singularity. To give an analogy, it is like the\nscalar field is following a track very near a precipice, but because the effective mass is very high in this regime, the\nscalar field is securely attached to the track and does not fall into the nearby precipice.\nThese numerical results, previously presented in [7], contradict the results of [6], where it was claimed that stars\nwith a gravitational potential larger than a critical value \u03a6max \u2248 0.1 could not be constructed. The reason advocated\nin [6] was the presence of the singularity, as stressed previously in [5].

The value \u03c6min for\nMP \u03c1\u0303c\nthe minimum of the effective potential is plotted by dashed (gray) line.\n\narguments in [5] and [6] supporting this interpretation were not valid 7 . We also indicated that the exploration of\nthe scalar field profile was numerically challenging for small values of v0 , because the distance between the scalar\nfield value and the singularity is proportional to v03 . Since the value used in [6] was v0 \u223c 10\u22126 , one could strongly\nsuspect that the results obtained in [6] were probably due to a numerical instability. This explanation was confirmed\nsubsequently in [29], which tried to reproduce the numerical analysis as [6], using the same technique, namely the\nshooting method. Indeed, they were able to construct highly relativistic stars, but with a parameter v0 \u223c 10\u22122 .\nAlthough we show only our numerical results in the case of the polytropic equation of state, we have also performed\nsimilar numerical integrations for constant energy density stars. We have obtained quite similar results as in the\nchameleon model. For instance, we have been able to obtain numerical solutions up to the value \u03a6\u2217 = 0.33 for the\ngravitational potential 8 (with the parameters \u01eb1 = \u01eb0 = 1, v0 = 0.01).\nD.\n\n\"Cured\" f(R) gravity\n\nAlthough the existence of neutron stars is, so far9 , compatible with the f (R) models we have just investigated, the\nsituation is not the same in cosmology. It has indeed been noticed in [4, 30, 31] that the behaviour of these theories\nis pathological when one considers their past cosmological evolution, with the generic presence of a singularity in the\nnot so distant past. As a way to \"cure\" this pathology at high curvature, it has been suggested to add R2 term10 .\nThis extra term radically changes the behaviour of the potential at very high curvature, as illustrated in Fig. 9 for\n\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\nNote also that, obviously, the problem encountered in [6] cannot be explained by the sign of the trace of the energy-momentum tensor\nsince their gravitational potential is well below the critical value (10).\nNote that a similar value for the maximum gravitational potential, \u03a6\u2217 = 0.345, was obtained in [29].\nIt would be also worth considering a supernova explosion and the birth of a neutron star in the context of f (R) theories. The present\nwork deals only with static solutions and not how they could be reached in an evolutionary process.\nAnother way to avoid a pathological behavior would be to construct f (R) model separating the singularity with infinite energy barrier,\nas it was done in [32]. It was argued, however, that this particular model does not satisfy local gravity constraints and SDSS data [33].\n\n\f18\nthe model\ni\nh\n\u0010\n\u0001\u2212n \u0011\n+ \u03c3 x2 ,\nf (R\u0303) = R0 x \u2212 \u03bb 1 \u2212 1 + x2\n\nx\u2261\n\nR\u0303\n.\nR0\n\n(33)\n\nOne sees that the corresponding potential has no singularity at \u03c6 = 0 and the scalar field can now take positive values,\ncorresponding to high curvatures.\nThe extra R2 term has the additional advantage that it can drive inflation in the early Universe (see e.g. [34, 35]), as\nin the pioneering Starobinsky model [36]. Recently, however, it was argued in [13] that one cannot relate smoothly the\ninflation epoch with the present acceleration epoch with the above model (33). As an example of a viable transition\nbetween two accelerating solutions, the model\n#\n\"\nR\u03032\nR0\ncosh(R\u0303/\u01eb \u2212 b)\n+\n, \u01eb\u2261\n(34)\nf (R\u0303) = (1 \u2212 c)R\u0303 + c \u01eb ln\ncosh b\n6M 2\nb + ln(2 cosh b)\nwith 0 < c < 1/2, was proposed in [13], where the new mass scale M must be of the order 1012 GeV to reproduce the\nstandard predictions of inflation.

Near the boundary of the star, it deviates from the local minimum and converges\ntowards the asymptotic minimum outside the star.

The main properties are the following.\nDeep inside the star, the scalar field follows very closely the minimum of its effective potential (if it exists). As a\nconsequence, if the minimum changes as a function of the radius, the scalar field will closely follow it. If \u03c1\u0303 \u2212 3P\u0303 < 0,\nwhich can occur for instance in the central region of very compact stars with constant energy density, there is no\nminimum for the effective potential. It is however possible to find numerical solutions for constant energy stars with\nboth w < 1/3 and w > 1/3 regions, but only up to some maximum gravitational potential. We have given qualitative\narguments to show that one expects tachyonic instabilities if most of the star is characterized by w > 1/3.\nAs already emphasized in our previous work [7], our results invalidate the claim that highly relativistic stars cannot\nbe constructed in f (R) theories. Numerically, the construction of a relativistic stars in f (R) gravity is a challenging\ntask because the scalar field value is extremely close to the singularity in the center of the star. We have also\nconstructed relativistic stars in the so-called \"cured\" f (R) models, which have been advocated to solve a cosmological\nsingularity problem.\nWe have also illustrated how the screening effect of the chameleon mechanism manifests itself for relativistic stars,\nby computing numerically the effective coupling of the star as well as the post-Newtonian parameter \u03b3\u0303.\n\nNote: while this paper was being completed, another paper [37] on relativistic stars in f (R) theories appeared on\nthe arXiv, although in a different context.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank Nathalie Deruelle, Gilles Esposito-Farese, Andrei Frolov, Eric Gourgoulhon, Kei-ichi Maeda,\nJ\u00e9r\u00f4me Novak, Ignacy Sawicki, Alexei Starobinsky, Shinji Tsujikawa and Riad Ziour for very instructive discussions.\n\n\f20\nWe also thank Tomohiro Harada and Shinya Okubo for pointing out an incorrect statement in a previous version\nof this manuscript.
