Introduction\nThe Cosmic Far-Infrared Background (CIB) was detected\nby Puget et al. (1996), exploiting COBE-FIRAS data, and\nhas now been firmly established over a range of wavelengths (e.g. Dwek et al. (1998); Gispert et al. (2000);\nHauser & Dwek (2001)). The intensity is quite high with\nrespect to predictions based on evolutionary models of\nstar formation in galaxy populations inferred from optical\ndata. Source counts obtained with SCUBA at 850 \u03bcm and\nISO at 170 and 15 \u03bcm have partly resolved the CIB and\nshown a strong cosmological evolution. In the future, farIR and sub-millimeter telescopes from ground and space\nwill perform deep surveys over small areas, aimed at resolving a substantial fraction of the CIB and to shed light\non the number density, luminosity and spectral evolution\nof the infrared galaxy populations. However, investigation of the clustering of these populations requires surveys over much larger areas. One way to tackle the limitation on the number of detected galaxies per field is to\nsearch for CIB fluctuations. So far, CIB fluctuations has\nonly been observed at 170 \u03bcm in the FIRBACK fields\n(Lagache & Puget 2000) and at 90 and 170 \u03bcm in the\nSend offprint requests to: Marc-Antoine Miville-Desch\u00eanes\nCorrespondence to: miville@lra.ens.fr\n\nLockman hole (Matsuhara et al. 2000) surveys. These detections were probably dominated by the Poissonian contribution. By analyzing larger FIRBACK fields, power\nspectra seem to reveal correlated fluctuations, well above\nthe cirrus contribution (Puget & Lagache 2002). These\nresults are currently under further investigation. Above\n170 \u03bcm, only SCUBA observations might currently be able\nto give information on the fluctuations. However, no significant CIB correlations have been detected in the SCUBA\nmaps (Peacock et al. 2000). The CIB anisotropies are\nmainly contributed by moderate to high redshift starforming galaxies, whose clustering properties and evolutionary histories are currently unknown. Since the clustering strength depends on the bias at the relevant redshift, observing the CIB correlated fluctuations will provide valuable informations on bulge and elliptical formation, as well as potentially QSOs, thereby providing clues\non the physical relations between dark matter and starburst galaxies.\nIn this paper we present the results of a power spectrum\nanalysis of the IRAS 60 and 100 \u03bcm emission of 12 regions\nin the sky with very low interstellar emission. All these regions are characterized by an excess of power at high spatial frequencies with respect to the interstellar emission.\nWe will show that this excess is not of instrumental origin\n\n\f2\n\nM.-A. Miville-Desch\u00eanes et al.: Power spectrum of the CIB at 60 and 100 \u03bcm\n\nand may be attributed to the CIB. The discovery of the\nCIB fluctuations at 60 and 100 \u03bcm could give constraints\non the number counts below the IRAS point source detection limit. However, instead of extrapolating the number\ncounts at 60 and 100 \u03bcm using the level of the fluctuations, which is of limited cosmological interest, we prefer\nto use the two detections in a more general framework of\nthe modelisation of the IR galaxy evolution that combines\nall existing number counts, redshift distributions, and observations of the CIB and its fluctuations, in the whole IR\nand submm range Lagache et al. (2002).\nThe paper is organized as follow. After a presentation (\u00a7 2)\nof the data used for this analysis we describe in \u00a7 3 the\npower spectrum at 60 and 100 \u03bcm of the 12 fields selected.\nIn \u00a7 4 we present the method used to separate the Galactic\nand extra-Galactic contributions to the power spectrum\nand we discuss our results in \u00a7 5.\n\n2. Data - the ISSA maps\n2.1. The IRAS Sky Survey Atlas\nThe IRAS mission was originally designed to measure\npoint sources but it also provided spectacular images of\nthe Galactic dust diffuse emission. These images, constituted of 500 \u00d7 500 pixels with a pixel size of 1.5' (i.e. the\nsize of the field is 12.5\u25e6 \u00d7 12.5\u25e6), are gathered in the IRAS\nSky Survey Atlas (ISSA). Each ISSA map is the result\nof the combination of up to three individual maps (named\nfor HCON Hours CONfirmation). The HCON images were\nconstructed from different observations of the same region\nseparated by several months. The angular resolution of the\n60 and 100 \u03bcm band images are respectively 1.5\u2032 \u00d74.7\u2032 and\n3.0\u2032 \u00d7 5.0\u2032 . To study the power spectrum of the CIB emission at 60 and 100 \u03bcm, we have worked on 12 ISSA maps\nwith particularly low cirrus emission.\n\n2.2. Calibration of the ISSA maps\nSpecial care has been taken to have a consistent diffuse\nemission calibration through the Atlas. But, as the IRAS\nmission was designed to provide absolute photometry only\nfor point sources, the ISSA images give only relative photometry and cannot be used to determine the absolute\nsurface brightness for diffuse emission. Based on a comparison with the DIRBE data, it has been shown (Wheelock\net al. 1993; Schlegel et al. 1998) that, at large scale (> a\nfew degrees), the amplitude of the fluctuations are overestimated in the ISSA maps by a factor 1.15 at 60 \u03bcm and\n1.39 at 100 \u03bcm. We have thus applied these factors to our\nmaps prior to the analysis.\nThere is also an uncertainty on the zero level of the\nISSA maps, for which the zodiacal emission has been subtracted (Wheelock et al. 1993). This uncertainty is dominated at 60 and 100 \u03bcm by an imperfect knowledge of\nthe detector offsets and of the zodiacal emission. As we\nare looking at fluctuations of the signal, a global additive\noffset has no impact on the power spectrum.

To restore appropriately the large scale\nstructure of the selected fields we have compared each\nISSA map with the DIRBE data (for which the zodiacal emission correction was better done). The ISSA maps,\nmultiplied by the appropriate gain value (0.87 at 60 \u03bcm\nand 0.72 at 100 \u03bcm) were convolved by the DIRBE beam\nand then subtracted from the DIRBE data. This offset\nmap is then added to the ISSA map. Note that we do not\nuse the Schlegel et al. (1998) IRAS rescaled maps, constructed in a similar manner, for which it is impossible to\nrecover the associated instrumental noise.\n\n2.3.

These fields were selected on\nthe basis of their low cirrus emission (mean brightness\n\u223c 1 MJy/sr at 100 \u03bcm) but also on their redundancy; we\nhave selected only fields for which each sky position has\nbeen observed at least twice in order to be able to estimate the contribution of the noise to the power spectrum.\nThe typical stripping of the ISSA maps is very efficiently\nremoved from the signal power spectrum by the noise estimate procedure using the difference between observations\nof the different HCON as will be shown in \u00a7 3.3 and Fig.\n2.\nThe 60 and 100 \u03bcm ISSA maps of the twelve selected fields,\ngain and offset corrected, are shown in Figs A.2 to A.3\nand their central coordinates are gathered in Table 1. Five\nfields are located in the southern hemisphere, most of them\nin the neighborhood of the Marano field (Marano et al.\n1988), and seven are spread over the northern hemisphere\n(ISSA map number 376 contains the Lockman Hole).\n\n3. Power spectrum of the 60 and 100 \u03bcm sky\n\n\fM.-A. Miville-Desch\u00eanes et al.: Power spectrum of the CIB at 60 and 100 \u03bcm\n\n3\n\n3.1. Power spectrum computation\n\nTherefore, the noise level of the ISSA map is given by:\n\nFor a given image, the power spectrum P (k) is the absolute value of the Fourier Transform (we use the Fast\nFourier Transform (FFT) function of q\nIDL) of the image,\n\n\u03c3diff\n\u03c3issa = \u221a \u221a .\nn 2\n\naveraged over constant values of k = kx2 + ky2 . To make\nsure that map boundaries are not contaminating the computed power spectrum, we apodize the image with a cosine function before computing the Fourier Transform.\nThis prevents the introduction of strong discontinuities\nwhen the image is periodized in the FFT algorithm (see\nAppendix A).\nThe power spectrum of the 100 \u03bcm ISSA map of one\nof our fields is shown in Fig. 1. Since the zodiacal emission\nhas been subtracted in the ISSA maps, there are four main\ncontributions to the power spectrum at these wavelengths:\nthe cirrus emission, point sources, the CIB (resolved and\nunresolved) and the noise. Therefore, and if the noise and\nthe signal are not correlated, the power spectrum P (k)\ncan be expressed in the following manner:\nP (k) = \u03b3(k) [Pdust (k) + Psource (k) + Pcib (k)] + N (k)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Pdust (k), Pcib (k), Psource (k) and N (k) are respectively the power spectrum of the dust emission, of the CIB,\nof individually detected point sources and of the noise. The\nfactor \u03b3(k) represents the instrumental function.\n\n(4)\n\nFor the example given in Fig. 1, the noise level is \u03c3issa =\n0.048 MJy/sr.\nIn general three HCON maps were averaged but parts\nof them may be undefined. Therefore, for each ISSA map\nwe looked at the three corresponding HCON maps and\nbuilt a mask n(x, y) that gives the number of defined values that were averaged at each positions. Then, the noise\nmap of a given ISSA map is estimated \u221a\nby p\nsubtracting two\nHCON maps and divide the result by 2 n(x, y).\nThe power spectra of the ISSA map and of its noise\nmap are shown in Fig. 1(bottom-left). Both power spectra\nmeet at small scales (k \u223c 0.2 pixel\u22121 ) where the signal is\nnoise dominated. The noise map is characterized by a \u223c\nk \u22120.8 power spectrum. We have investigated the variations\nof the statistical properties of the noise on ISSA maps\nwhere three complete HCONs exists. By looking at the\nthree possible difference maps built from three HCONs,\nwe found that the shape of the power spectrum of the\nnoise is rather constant with time and that the absolute\nlevel of the noise varies by less than 15% from one HCON\nto the other. This is equally true at 60 and 100 \u03bcm.\n\n3.2. Noise power spectrum\nOne of the main limitation of the component separation\nto the power spectrum is the estimate of the noise contribution. For ISSA maps, this contribution can be estimated accurately as they are the combination of up to\nthree HCON maps. Indeed the noise power spectrum of\nthe HCON maps, and therefore of the ISSA map, can be\nestimated by subtracting two HCON maps of the same\nregion. An example of the difference between two HCON\nmaps for a typical low brightness ISSA map is shown in\nFig. 1 (top-right). The characteristic stripping of the IRAS\ndata is seen in this difference map. The distribution of difference values is symmetric (when there is no strong point\nsources) and well fitted by a sum of two Gaussian functions (see Fig. 1, bottom-right).\nAs the distribution of the difference values is the sum\nof two Gaussian functions with an equivalent width \u03c3diff\nand assuming that the noise in the IRAS survey is stationary to a good approximation (as tested below), we\ncan conclude that the noise of an individual HCON can\nalso be characterized by an equivalent width:\n\u03c3diff\n\u03c3hcon = \u221a .\n2\n\n(2)\n\nFurthermore, the noise of the ISSA map, built from n\nHCON maps, is also Gaussian distributed with a width\nof:\n\u03c3hcon\n(3)\n\u03c3issa = \u221a .\nn\n\nFig. 2. Power spectrum (black solid line) of a typical\nbright ISSA field with no strong point sources. The cirrus\ncontribution to the power spectrum has been fitted by\na power law (P (k) \u221d k \u22122.86 for k < 0.015 arcmin\u22121 dash line). The dotted line is the cirrus fit multiplied by a\nGaussian PSF of \u03c3 = 0.07 arcmin\u22121 . The grey line is the\npower spectrum of the ISSA map (black solid line) divided\nby the Gaussian PSF.\n\n\f4\n\nM.-A.

This noise\nmap has been obtained by subtracting two individual HCON images that were used to build the ISSA map (see text\nfor details). Bottom left: Power spectrum of the ISSA map (upper curve) and of the noise map. The power spectrum\nof the noise map has been fitted by a power law \u221d k \u22120.83 for scales k \u2264 0.1 arcmin\u22121 . Above k=0.1 arcmin\u22121 , the\ndrop of the power spectrum is due to the instrumental function (see \u00a7 3.3). Bottom right: Histogram of the noise\nvalues, fitted by a sum of two Gaussian functions (Amplitude1 = 1376, \u03c31 = 0.04 MJy/sr; Amplitude2 = 711, \u03c32 =\n0.06 MJy/sr).\n\n3.3. Point spread function\nThe multiplicative factor \u03b3(k) in Eq. 1 represents the effective instrumental filter function of the system (telescope,\nfocal plane assembly, sky scanning and map making). For\nsome ISSA maps the instrumental function can be estimated directly from the power spectrum of the map. This\nis the case for maps where the brightness fluctuations are\ndominated by the cirrus emission and where the power\nspectrum is simply:\nP (k) = \u03b3(k) \u00d7 Pdust (k).\n\n(5)\n\nFollowing Gautier et al. (1992), the power spectrum of the\ncirrus dust emission follows a power law (Pdust (k) = Ak \u03b2 ).\nThis behavior has been confirmed through a detailed\nstudy of Hi 21 cm emission by Miville-Desch\u00eanes et al.\n(2002). These studies show that although the power spectrum slope may vary from region to region by \u223c20 % there\nis no systematic break at high spatial frequencies. On the\nbasis of these studies, we thus conclude that the power\nlaw representation for the cirrus power spectrum does not\nintroduce any systematic effect.\n\n\fM.-A. Miville-Desch\u00eanes et al.: Power spectrum of the CIB at 60 and 100 \u03bcm\n\nTo estimate \u03b3(k) directly on the power spectrum of\nISSA maps, we have selected 20 relatively bright regions\n(mean brightness greater than 8 MJy/sr) where the noise\nand CIB contributions are negligible. To make sure that\nthe fluctuations are dominated by the cirrus emission,\npoint sources were filtered out using a median filtering.\nAn example of the power spectrum of such an ISSA map\nis shown in Fig. 2. We found that the effective IRAS instrumental filter function in Fourier space is well describe\nby a Gaussian function both at 60 and 100 \u03bcm. To determine the width of the instrumental function, the power\nspectrum of the 20 fields were fitted by the following equation:\n\u0012 2\u0013\n\u2212k\n\u00d7 Ak \u03b2\n(6)\nP (k) = exp\n2\u03c3k2\nwhich represents the cirrus power law multiplied by the\nGaussian instrumental function. We have found \u03c3k =\n0.073 \u00b1 0.005 at 60 \u03bcm and \u03c3k = 0.065 \u00b1 0.005 at 100\n\u03bcm. In the real space, this corresponds to a Gaussian instrumental function of \u03c3 = 1.5 \u00b1 0.1 arcmin at 60 \u03bcm and\n\u03c3 = 1.7 \u00b1 0.1 arcmin at 100 \u03bcm. 1\nThe cutoff seen in Fig. 2 at frequencies larger than\n0.05 arcmin\u22121 is where the effect of the instrumental filter\nfunction is expected. When the power spectrum is divided\nby the Gaussian instrumental function (grey line) one sees\nthat this modeling does not stand for scales smaller than\n4.5 arcminutes (k > 0.22 arcmin\u22121 ). This is due to the\neffective resolution of the IRAS data. The power spectrum\nhas to be cut at the Nyquist frequency corresponding to\nthe 1.5' pixel ISSA map. However, the effective resolution\nof the IRAS data is about 3.8' and 4.25' respectively at\n60 and 100 \u03bcm. For that reason, all the power spectrum\nat frequency above 0.1 arcmin\u22121 , which corresponds to\nthe Nyquist frequency of the effective resolution, has to\nbe taken with cautious.\n\n4. Separation of the Galactic and extra-Galactic\ncomponents\nIn Figs. A.2 to A.3 we present the power spectrum of the\n60 and 100 \u03bcm ISSA maps of our twelve fields (black line).\nFor all these fields, the power spectrum of the noise has\nbeen subtracted and the result has been divided by the\nPSF \u03b3(k). At large scale, all the power spectra follow a\npower law typical of cirrus emission (Gautier et al. 1992).\nBut at k \u223c 0.01 arcmin\u22121 we notice a break in the spectra\nand an excess from the cirrus power law at small scales.\nThis power excess is observed for all our fields, at 60 and\n100 \u03bcm.\n\n4.1. Contribution of strong point sources\nThe power excess observed at small scales reveals the\npresence of a component with a flatter power spectrum,\n1\n\nThis is compatible with what we found by fitting a\nGaussian function on point sources.\n\n5\n\nlike what would be expected from noise or randomly distributed point sources. On the one hand, at this stage,\na noise contribution is unlikely as it has been well estimated and removed accordingly. On the other hand, in\nfields with such low cirrus emission, several extra-galactic\npoint sources were detected. In each of our fields, between\n200 and 300 point sources are listed in the IRAS Point\nSource Catalog (PSC), the vast majority of them being\nextra-galactic objects. We remove the contribution of all\npoint sources with flux greater than 1 Jy at 100 \u03bcm (and\nthe same sources at 60 \u03bcm). The cut at 1 Jy is chosen such\nthat the PSC above this limit will be nearly complete. This\ngives a well define separation between the sources contributing to the unresolved CIB and the resolved sources.\nThis is necessary for any quantitative use of our results.\nWe choose this cut in flux as low as possible to remove the\ncontribution of the nearby and resolved galaxies that dominate the power spectrum at scales k > 0.01 arcmin\u22121 (for\nthose galaxies, the spatial distribution is indistinguishable\nfrom a Poissonian distribution). Moreover, according to\nrecent simulations, the cut of 1 Jy at 100 \u03bcm almost corresponds to the flux where the non-euclidean part appears in\nthe number counts. To remove the contribution of strong\npoint sources (I100\u03bcm \u2265 1 Jy) to the power spectrum, they\nwere filtered out from the ISSA map. For each ISSA map,\nwe have extracted the point sources of the IRAS Point\nSource Catalog with a flux greater or equal to 1 Jy. Then\nwe have applied a median filtering to the ISSA map to\nestimate the background level and, at each point source\nposition,we have removed the points in a 12 \u00d7 12 window\nthat were more than 4 times the noise level (\u03c3issa ) above\nthe background. Finally, the missing points were replaced\nby a bilinear interpolation.\nThe power spectrum of the filtered ISSA maps is the\nblue line in Figs A.2 to A.3. A power excess at small scales\n(k > 0.02 arcmin\u22121 ) is still apparent on all power spectra,\nat 60 and 100 \u03bcm. This excess is likely to be the signature of the unresolved cosmic far-infrared background. To\ncharacterize it, the contribution of the cirrus emission has\nto be removed.\n\n4.2. Contribution of the cirrus emission\nAs we do not have any independent tracers of the cirrus\nemission at the IRAS scales for the whole fields, the only\nway to derive the cirrus contribution is to use the statistical properties of their spatial distribution. Following\nGautier et al. (1992) and Miville-Desch\u00eanes et al. (2002)\nthe power spectrum of interstellar dust emission is well describe by a power law. To remove this contribution to the\npower spectrum of the filtered ISSA maps, we have fitted\na power law on the large scale part of the power spectrum of the filtered maps. The best compromise between\nthe number of point on which to fit the power law and\nthe contamination from the CIB was to fit on k < 0.02\narcmin\u22121 . The point corresponding to the largest scale\nwas not used for the fitting as it suffers from a large sta-\n\n\f6\n\nM.-A. Miville-Desch\u00eanes et al.: Power spectrum of the CIB at 60 and 100 \u03bcm\n\ntistical error. The result of the fitting, and its associated\nuncertainty, are shown for each ISSA map in Figs A.2 to\nA.3. The uncertainty on the slope reflects the dispersion\nof the points around the fit. The red line in these figures is\nthe result of the subtraction of the cirrus power law from\nthe power spectrum of the filtered map (blue line); it is\nthe signature of the CIB.\n\n4.3. Contribution of the cosmic far-infrared\nbackground\nThe average of the 12 CIB contributions is shown in Fig. 3\n(black lines). The blue lines in this figure indicate the 1\u03c3\nuncertainty on the determination, including the PSF and\nthe estimate of the cirrus contribution errors. The 1\u03c3 uncertainty is very close to the rms variations of the 12 averaged values. The dispersion between the fields is thus\ndominated by the PSF and cirrus contribution errors, we\ndo not see any significant variation from field to field.\nMoreover, it is important to note that the detected excess\nat small scales is uncorrelated with the cirrus emission (the\nexcess disappears when the cirrus contribution increases).\nTherefore, our fields being spread over the sky, the excess\nat small scale is compatible with isotropic properties. This\nis an other argument in favor of an extra-galactic origin\nfor the excess.\nWe can note on Fig. A.2-9 that the power spectrum of\nthe resolved IRAS sources is varying by factor up to 10\nfrom field to field. The CIB (resolved and unresolved) fluctuations are dominated by the brightest sources in ISSA\nmaps. The number of such sources is quite small, leading\nto a high cosmic variance, and thus large variation from\nfield to field. On the contrary, for the unresolved CIB fluctuations, as sources above 1 Jy (about 300 per field) are\nremoved, the cosmic variance is lower than 6%, which is\nnegligible with respect to the 1\u03c3 uncertainty.\nThe CIB is detected over one decade in scales, from 5 to\n50 arcminutes. The power spectrum of the CIB at 60 and\n100 \u03bcm is compatible with a Poissonian distribution at\nspatial frequencies between 0.025 and 0.2 arcmin\u22121. The\nfluctuation level is \u223c 1.6 \u00d7 103 Jy2 /sr and \u223c 5.8 \u00d7 103\nJy2 /sr at 60 and 100 \u03bcm respectively.\n\n5. Discussion\n5.1. CIB fluctuations at 60 and 100 \u03bcm\nWe have shown here that the power spectrum of high latitude fields at 60 and 100 \u03bcm is characterized by a break at\nsmall scales (near 0.02 arcmin\u22121 ). As indicated by Gautier\net al. (1992), the power spectrum of the dust emission\nis usually well described by a power law proportional to\nk \u22123\u00b10.2 . A more detailed study of the statistical properties of the interstellar cirrus HI 21 cm emission has been\ncarried out by Miville-Desch\u00eanes (1999). In this analysis\nit is shown that there are limited variations of the spectral index of the power law from field to field but, what\nis most important for the present work, the power spec-\n\ntrum of cirrus emission for scales smaller than 12.5\u25e6 is\nalways characterized by a single power law with no break.\nTherefore, it is unlikely that the power excess observed\nhere at small scales is of interstellar origin.\nWe could also wonder if this break is of instrumental\norigin. It was shown by Wheelock et al. (1993) that the\nresponse of the IRAS detectors are affected by memory effects. This produces variations of the detector response as\na function of scale. This effect is more important at small\nscales (under a few tens of arcminutes) but Wheelock et al.\n(1993) have shown that the amplitude of the fluctuations\nat these scales were underestimated. This effect will thus\nproduce a drop of the power spectrum at small scale and\ncannot explain the power excess observed here.\nOn the other hand, instrumental noise could produce\nsuch an excess in the power spectrum. But, as the IRAS\nISSA maps result from redundant individual observations,\nwe were able to estimate the contribution of the noise to\nthe power spectrum. We are aware that our estimate of\nthe noise rely on the fact that the individual HCONs are\nindependant. This is not perfectly true as, in the construction of the HCONs, an offset was added to each scan to\nminimize the difference between different observations of\nthe same position. Therefore the noise level estimated by\nsubtracting HCONs may be underestimated at the scale\nof a scan, which is a few degrees. But at this angular scale\nthe signal is completely dominated by the cirrus emission,\neven in the low brightness regions selected for our analysis. At the scale of a few arcminutes where the CIB is\ndetected, the noise contribution to the power spectrum\nhas been removed accurately.\nIn fact it appears that most of the power excess can be\nattributed to the numerous extra-galactic point sources\nthat are present in such a low cirrus emission field. When\nthe strong (I100\u03bcm > 1 Jy) point sources are removed\nfrom the ISSA maps, we recover a power spectrum\ntypical of cirrus emission at low spatial frequencies\nbut with still a power excess at small scales (k> 0.02\narcmin\u22121 ) that can be attributed to the unresolved\ncosmic infrared background. Moreover, the residue has\nhomogeneous properties over the sky, consistent with CIB.\nKnox et al. (2001) computed the expected power spectrum of the CIB at several frequencies (\u03bd \u2264 1060 GHz),\nexploiting the far-IR volume emissivity derived from the\ncount models of Guiderdoni et al. (1998) and assuming a\nbias b = 3, constant with redshift. They concluded that\nthe clustering-induced fluctuations can match those of the\nCMB at l .300. They also predict a shape of the CIB\npower spectrum peaking around scales of 1-3 degrees. This\nbroad maximum, if present, is at the limit of our frequency\nrange where the noise is becoming large, making the detection of the clustering very difficult. The power spectra of the CIB at 60 and 100 \u03bcm are compatible with a\nPoissonian distribution with levels \u223c 1.6 \u00d7 103 Jy2 /sr and\n\u223c 5.8 \u00d7 103 Jy2 /sr respectively.\n\n\fM.-A.

Redshift distribution of the sources making the CIB and the fluctuations at 60, 100 and 170 \u03bcm. The first\ntwo-left panels are for the total contributions, the last two-right panels, for sources with flux below 1 Jy (Lagache\net al. 2002)\n\n\f8\n\nM.-A. Miville-Desch\u00eanes et al.: Power spectrum of the CIB at 60 and 100 \u03bcm\n\n5.2. CIB intensity and anisotropy amplitudes color\nratio\nThe CIB rms fluctuations in the IRAS maps corresponding\nto the white noise power spectra are:\nZ\n\u03c3 2 = Pcib (k)2\u03c0kdk Jy 2 /sr2\n(7)\ngiving \u03c3=0.048 MJy/sr and \u03c3=0.09 MJy/sr at 60 and\n100 \u03bcm respectively. As shown by Gispert et al. (2000),\nthe CIB at different wavelengths is dominated by sources\nat different redshifts, larger wavelengths being dominated\nby more distant sources. The same applies to the fluctuations: lower frequencies probe higher redshifts (e.g. Knox\net al. (2001)) The fluctuations at 60 \u03bcm are dominated by\nnearby bright objects. When we remove these objects, the\nresidual fluctuations are quite low. At 100 \u03bcm, the contribution of higher redshift objects is increasing, leading to\nhigher level of residual fluctuations. Therefore, the ratio\nof the 60 to 100 \u03bcm fluctuation is qualitatively consistent\nwith what is expected.\nThis is illustrated more quantitatively in Fig.4 on\nthe panels showing the redshift distribution of sources\ncontributing to the CIB intensity and the fluctuations\n(Lagache et al. 2002). It is clear from these figures that\nthe z-distribution of the fluctuations is bimodal, with one\ncontribution at redshift lower than 0.25 and the other one\ncentered at redshift around 1. For all sources the ratio\nof nearby to moderate-redshift source contribution to the\nfluctuations is equal to 3.8, 1.8 and 1.3 at 60, 100, 170\n\u03bcm respectively, illustrating that fluctuations at larger\nwavelengths are dominated by more distant sources. When\nthe brightest sources are removed the ratio of nearby to\nmoderate-redshift contribution becomes equal to 1.7, 1\nand 0.74 at 60, 100, 170 \u03bcm. In this case, at 100 \u03bcm the\ncontribution to the fluctuations of nearby and moderateredshift sources is the same, becoming lower at higher\nwavelength. At 60 \u03bcm, the fluctuations are still dominated\nby the nearby objects.\nFor the three wavelengths, the CIB is mainly due to\nsources at redshift around 1. A detailed analysis of the CIB\nfluctuations at 100 and 170 \u03bcm (which is beyond the scope\nof this paper) will give information on the distribution of\nsources at z\u223c1 making the bulk of the CIB. This is particularly true at 170 \u03bcm where sources with flux lower than\n4\u03c3=135 mJy can be removed (Dole et al. 2001), leading\nfluctuations highly dominated by the moderate-z sources.\nWe can compute the ratio of CIB fluctuations to intensity (R\u03bb = \u03c3I\u03bb\u03bb ) at 100 \u03bcm and compare it with the\nprevious determination at 170 \u03bcm. To compute R100 and\nR170 , we use:\n\u2013 a CIB intensity at 100 \u03bcm of 0.5 MJy/sr (Renault et al.\n2001), leading to R100 = 0.18\n\u2013 a CIB intensity at 170 \u03bcm of 1 MJy/sr Lagache & Dole\n(2001). For the fluctuations, we assume that a cut of\n1 Jy at 60 and 100 \u03bcm corresponds to the same cut\nat 170 \u03bcm. We obtain rms fluctuations of 0.12 MJy/sr\n\n(corresponding to \u223c11000 Jy2 /sr, (Puget & Lagache\n2002)). This gives R170 = 0.12\nThe ratio R is decreasing between 100 and 170 \u03bcm, as expected. At 60 \u03bcm, the minimal hypothesis is to consider\nthat R60 is equal to R100 =0.18 which gives an upper limit\nof 0.27 MJy/sr on the CIB intensity. An illustrative logarithmic extrapolation of R out to 60 \u03bcm gives R60 =0.27\nleading to an estimate of the CIB intensity at 60 \u03bcm of\n0.18 MJy/sr, which is significantly smaller than the previous determination of Finkbeiner et al. (2000) of 0.56\nMJy/sr.\n\n5.3. Implication for the component separation\nThis work suggests that the high latitude IRAS maps, in\nthe lowest cirrus regions, cannot be used as a tracer of the\ninterstellar extinction structure as proposed by (Schlegel\net al. 1998). In fact it should be noted that it is only above\nan intensity of order of 10 MJy/sr at 100 \u03bcm that the CIB\nfluctuations are lower than the cirrus contribution at the\nsmallest scales (k\u223c0.2 arcmin\u22121 ).\nPresent and future CMB observations, above 100\nGHz, with high sensitivity bolometers need to remove\nforeground contributions (cirrus and CIB fluctuations).\nThe CIB spectrum being significantly \"colder\" than\nthe cirrus spectrum (Icirrus 100\u03bcm/Icirrus 1mm \u223c 30;\nICIB 100\u03bcm/ICIB 1mm \u223c 5), the relative contribution of\nthe CIB will increase with wavelength. It is thus expected\nthat at 1 mm the range in l space dominated by the CIB\nwill be much more extended than sees at 100 \u03bcm. This\nquestion will be dealt in a forthcoming paper.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe Fond FCAR du Qu\u00e9bec provided funds to support this\nresearch project.\n\nReferences\nDole, H., Gispert, R., Lagache, G., et al., 2001, A&A, 372,\n364.\nDwek, E., Arendt, R.

The amplitude image\n\nannulus of constant k =\n\nof a typical ISSA map is shown in Fig A.1 (top-right).\nIn this figure, the frequency k = 0 is a the center of the\namplitude image. The amplitude decreases with increasing value of k but one also notices the presence of a cross\nthat reveals an increase of the fluctuation level in the horizontal and vertical directions. This cross is caused by the\nFast Fourier Transform algorithm that makes an \"infinite\npavement\" with the image prior to compute the Fourier\nTransform. As the ISSA images are not periodic objects,\nthis operation produces discontinuities where the left (top)\nmeets the right (bottom) side of the image. These horizontal and vertical discontinuities are responsible for the cross\nseen in the amplitude image. The main problem with this\ncross is that it increases artificially the power when the\naverage over k is done. Furthermore, the power increase is\nnot constant as a function of k which modify the slope of\nthe spectrum as well as the normalization.\nThe usual method to get rid of this effect is to apodize\nthe image so that the left (top) and right (bottom) sides of\nthe image have a similar flux level. Another method which\ndo not modify the image but acts on the amplitude image itself is to compute P (k) by taking the median value\nat constant k. For \u223c85% of the ISSA maps we have inspected, these two methods give very similar results. But\nwhen the cross is very strong, the power at small scales is\nstill overestimated by the \"median\" method. Furthermore,\nat small k values, there are less points to average and a\nlarge fraction of them are affected by the cross effect; at\nthese frequencies, the median value may not be significant.\nFor all these reasons, we have adopted the \"apodization\"\nmethod.\n\n\f10\n\nM.-A.
