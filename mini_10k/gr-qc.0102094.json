is easily shown to be\ntrivial in Einstein teleparallelism [5].Soleng solution is based on the construction of a spin polarized cylinder which allows us to build a spinning cosmic\nstring with torsion where only one component of torsion survives and where\nthe spinning particles are direct along the infinite axis of the cylinder in\nEinstein-Cartan theory.Soleng showed based on this model that close to the\ncosmic spinning string (or near a point particle equations.In this report we\nshow that in T4 CTC curves would imply on a lower bound constraint on\nthe cosmic string angular momentum in order to allow for CTC and consequently to build time-machines.Teleparallel solutions have recently attacted\nattention since the works of J.G.Pereira and his group [6, 7] who show that\nit is possible to explain old problems in physics such as the tetrad complex of\ngravitational energy by making use of teleparallelism [6] as well as build some\nnew teleparallel Scwarzschild and Kerr solutions [7]and discussing the LenseThirring effect in teleparallel geometry.More recently yet Garcia de Andrade\nhas shown [8, 9] that is possible to explain another problems in cosmology\nsuch as the global rotation of the universe by using G\u00f6del teleparallel solution\nin a very natural way.Besides as shown very recently it is possible to obtain\na system of a cosmic string inside a black hole as a T4 solution.Let us begin\nby considering the spacetime metric with cylindrical symmetry considered\nby Soleng as given by the one-form basis\n\u03c9 0 = dt + Md\u03c6\n\n(1)\n\n\u03c9 1 = dr\n\n(2)\n\n\u03c9 2 = \u03c1d\u03c6\n\n(3)\n\n3\n\n\u03c9 = dz\n\n(4)\n\nIn terms of Cartan exterior differential forms the Soleng metric can be expressed as\nds2 = (\u03c9 0)2 \u2212 (\u03c9 1)2 \u2212 (\u03c9 2 )2 \u2212 (\u03c9 3 )2\n(5)\nNow from the Cartan structure equations\n\nQi = d\u03c9 i + \u03c9ji \u2227\u03c9 j\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03c9ji is the connection one-form and\ni\nRji = Rjkm\n(\u0393)\u03c9 k \u2227\u03c9 m = d\u03c9ji + \u03c9ki \u2227\u03c9jk\n\n(7)\n\n\f3\n\nCosmic strings and CTC in T4\n\ni\nHere \u2227 is the exterior product of forms symbol and Rjkl\n(\u0393) are the components of the Riemann-Cartan geometry curvature tensor and Rji is the curvature 2 \u2212 f orm.Rewriting the metric (1) in the differential forms language\none obtains\nds2 = \u03b7ij \u03c9 i \u03c9 j\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03b7ij = diag(+1, \u22121, \u22121, \u22121) is the tetrad Minkowski metric.By making\ni\nuse of the teleparallel condition Rjkl\n(\u0393) = 0 into the equation (7) we notice\nthat the constraint\n\u03c9ji = 0\n(9)\nfulfills the teleparallel condition.Here we addopt this stronger teleparallel\ncondition which also has been addopted by Letelier [5] in the construction\nof torsion loops in teleparallel spacetimes.By using the condition (9) into\nequation (6) one obtains the torsion 2-form in the form\ni\nQi = d\u03c9 i = Tjk\n\u03c9 j \u2227\u03c9 k\n\n(10)\n\ni\nwhere Tjk\nare the components of the Cartan's torsion tensor.Applying this\nsimple expression to the expressions for the basis one-forms of the cosmic\nspinning torsion string system above one obtains after a quick computation\none obtains the components of the torsion tensor as\n0\ns0 = T12\n=\n\n2\ns1 = T12\n=\n\nM,r\n\u03c1\n\n(11)\n\n\u03c1,r\n\u03c1\n\n(12)\n\nBy assuming that both torsion components inside the cylinder are constants\nequations (11) and (12) become differential equations that can be solved\nimmediatly to yield the interior solution\nds2 = [dt +\n\ns0 s 1 r 2\ne d\u03c6] \u2212 [dr 2 + dz 2 ] \u2212 e2s1 r d\u03c62\ns1\n\n(13)\n\nThis metric has some very nice properties that now we wish to comment.First\naccording to Paul Tod [10] classification of the conical metric\nds2 = (dt + \u03b1d\u03c6)2 \u2212 \u03b2 2 r 2 d\u03c62 \u2212 (dz + \u03b3d\u03c6)2\n\n(14)\n\n\f4\n\nCosmic strings and CTC in T4\n\nwhen the last term can be ommited but \u03b1 is non-zero the metric would\nrepresented a point particle rotating in 2 + 1 gravity.Therefore with this\nclassification one could say by comparison with our interior solution (13) one\nnotices that this solution could be interpreted as a singular behaviour at\nr = 0 where a point particle would rotate at the center of the cosmic string\nat 3 + 1 gravity spacetime.Before making use of the matching conditions to\ndisccuss CTC conditions we could compute the torsion flux by making use\nof geometrical phases formula\nZ\n\nQ0 =\n\u03a3\n\nZ\n\n\u03c9 0 = 2\u03c0\n\ns0 s 1 r\ne\ns1\n\n(15)\n\nwhich shows that at the conic singularity r = 0 torsion flux is constant.CTC\ncould be immagined as torsion loops around the cosmic strings [6].Let us now\npointed out that the interior solution to be physicsl should be matched to an\nexterior solution preferable with a GR vacuum of the type given by Soleng\none-forms\nJ\n\u03b80 = dt +\nd\u03c6\n(16)\n2\u03c0\n\u03b81 = dr\n(17)\n\u03bc\n)(r + r0 )d\u03c6\n(18)\n\u03b82 = (1 \u2212\n2\u03c0\n\u03b83 = dz\n(19)\nwhere J is the intrinsic angular momentum of the cosmic string and \u03bc is the\nstring mass.The Arkuszewski-Kopczynski-Ponomariev (AKP) [11] mactching\nconditions of EC theory can be used here [2]\ng22 |+ = g22 |\u2212\n\n(20)\n\ng02,1 |+ = g02,1 |\u2212 \u2212 T012\n\n(21)\n\ng22,1 |+ = g22,1 |\u2212 \u2212 2T212\n\n(22)\n\nwhere the plus sign refers to the exterior solution and the minus sign refers\nto the interior solution.Substitution of the respective above solutions into the\nmatching conditions yields\ne2s1 r = \u2212(1 \u2212\n\n\u03bc 2\n) (R + r0 )2\n2\u03c0\n\n(23)\n\n\f5\n\nCosmic strings and CTC in T4\n\ns0 s 1 R J\ne\n= \u2212 s0\n(24)\ns1\n\u03c0\nwhere R is the radius of the cylinder.From these last two expressions allows\nus to determine the constant torsion components in terms of the cylinder\nradius.They also allows us to obtain a constraint between the angular momentum of the T4 string and the ratio of the torsion components\n2\n\n\u03c0\n\nJ\ns0\n=\ns1\n[s1 + 2es1 r ]\n\n(25)\n\nLet us now from these expressions to examine the problem of construction of\nCTC in T4 .We know from GR that the CTC are allowed with the following\nconstraint\n\u03bc\nJ\n)(r + r0 ) <\n(26)\n(1 \u2212\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\nwhich at the surface of the cylinder is\n(1 \u2212\n\n\u03bc\nJ\n)(R + r0 ) <\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n\n(27)\n\nTo simpland from the matching conditions we reduce this expression to\ns0\n[1 +\n\nq\n\n2 ss10 ]\n\n<\n\nJ\n2\u03c0\n\n(28)\n\nThis expression can be further simplified if we consider that torsion can be\n\"isotropic\" or that they have the same s0 = S1 To simpland from the matching\nconditions we reduce this expression to\ns0\nJ\n\u221a <\n2\u03c0\n[1 + 2]\n\n(29)\n\nNevertheless by asimilar reasoning used by Soleng we can show that the\nassuption that CTC can be constructed leads us to a contradiction.Let us\n\u03bc\n<<< 1 thus from expression (26) one obtains\nassume that R >> r0 and 2\u03c0\nthat\nJ\nR<\n(30)\n2\u03c0\nh\nh\nTherefore if we consider thatR = m\nand J = \u03bc m\none may conclude that\n\u03bc > 1 which contradicts our assumption that \u03bc2\u03c0 << 1.Therefore one may\nconclude that there is no possibility of building CTC in T4 as in the EC case.\n\n\fCosmic
