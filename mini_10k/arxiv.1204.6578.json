There is a vast literature on the subject, including by-now classical references [1, 2, 7, 9, 13, 30]. One may also replace\nthe Laplacian operator by the p-Laplacian operator; this problem arises in\nvarious nonlinear flow laws, and several physical situations, e.g. electrochemical machining and potential flow in fluid mechanics (see for instance\n[7, 25, 34, 36, 37, 56, 11]).\n\u2217\n\nUniversitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, ETSEIB - Dept. de MA1, Av. Diagonal 647,\n08028 Barcelona,Spain\n\u2020\nDepartment of Mathematics, University of Texas at Austin, 2515 Speedway C1200 ,\nAustin TX, 78712, USA\n\u2021\nDepartment of Mathematics, The Royal Institute of Technology 100 44 Stockholm,\nSweden\n\n1\n\n\fIn this paper we propose a new formulation of the p-Laplacian Bernoulli\nproblem for 1 < p < +\u221e, in which the boundary gradient condition is\nreplaced by a (weaker) condition on the distance between two different level\nsets of the solution. More precisely, given the p-capacitary potential u in\nthe annulus \u03a9 \\ K we ask that\n(1.1)\n\ndist(x, {u = l}) = \u03bb,\n\n\u2200x \u2208 \u2202\u03a9,\n\nwhere {u = l} is the l-level set of u and l, \u03bb are two positive given constants.\nCondition (1.1) was considered in [50, 51, 52], while studying diffusion problems with stationary isothermic surfaces; and independently by\nthe third author in [60], where he considered a discrete version of Serrin's\nproblem. This second approach was inspired by a parabolic free boundary\nmodel in finance in which the distance between the free boundary (that is\nthe zero level set for the solution) and the location of a source is prescribed\n(c.f. [44, 33, 22, 20] for an overview).\nThe novelty in the approach introduced here is that our problem with\ncondition (1.1) approximates the solution of the classical Bernoulli problem\nin the following sense: as \u03bb \u2192 0, any p-capacitary function u\u03bb vanishing on\n\u2202\u03a9 and satisfying (1.1) with l = \u03c9\u03bb converges to a p-capacitary function\nu vanishing on \u2202\u03a9 such that |\u2207u| = \u03c9 on \u2202\u03a9. In some sense, this new\nformulation can be understood as a discrete Bernoulli problem.\nTwo different problems can be set up according to where the free boundary lies in the annulus: the exterior problem (PE ), considered in Section 3,\nand the interior one (PI ), considered in Section 4. It is clear that the geometry of the domains will play a crucial role in both problems.\nIn this paper we deal with two different geometries: the convex and\nthe star-shaped case. We address the questions of existence, multiplicity,\nuniqueness and regularity for the discrete Bernoulli problem, together with\nconvergence to the usual Bernoulli problem in the convex setting.\nThe main ideas in our paper follow the approach by sub- and supersolutions introduced by Beurling in [13]. For the classical Bernoulli problem\nin the convex case with p-Laplacian operator, questions of existence and\nuniqueness were addressed in [36, 37, 38]. It is noteworthy that the use of the\nproperties of the distance function (1.1) avoids many of the technicalities: for\nexample, higher regularity for solutions is an immediate consequence from\nexistence theory, which is not the case for the classical Bernoulli problem.\nThe most standard approach for the Bernoulli problem is either variational or by singular perturbation. In the case p = 2, the seminal paper by\nAlt-Caffarelli [9] shows existence of a solution using variational techniques\n2\n\n\fwithout any geometric restriction on the set \u2202{u > 0}. Moreover it is shown\nthat the free boundary is flat, and consequently of class C 1,\u03b1 up to a hypersurface of Hn\u22121 -measure zero. For N = 2 they prove that the free boundary\nis globally analytic (see [42]). Recently in [19] it was shown that there exists\nno variational solution with singular free boundary for N = 3. The question\nremains open for 4 \u2264 N \u2264 6, since in [27] existence of minimal cones is\nshown for N = 7.\nFor p 6= 2 see [24] and [25]; in particular regularity is considered in\n[25, 26], where the authors extend the results of [9] (C 1,\u03b1 regularity near flat\npoints). They prove that for N = 2 the free boundary is globally analytic\nfor 2 \u2212 \u03b4 < p < +\u221e with \u03b4 an absolute constant. For N 6= 2 not many\nresults are available: Petrosyan in [56] shows that for any N \u2264 k\u2217 \u2212 1 and\nany 2 \u2212 \u03b4 < p < 2 + \u03b4 the variational solution has globally analytic free\nboundary, where k\u2217 is the critical dimension above which any variational\nsolution has free boundary with singular points.\nIf one adds a priori geometrical assumptions, the problem becomes more\ntractable. If the initial given domain is convex, for any 1 < p < +\u221e there\nexists a unique classical solution, and the free boundary is also convex and\nC 2,\u03b1 for both interior and exterior case. This is done in [36, 37, 38] using\nBeurling's method on sub- and super-solutions.\nAlthough the literature is not yet exhaustive, one would expect similar\nresults if we relax the geometry of the domain to be star-shaped only (see, for\ninstance [7]). The p-capacitary potential in a star-shaped annulus has starshaped level sets, according to the rearrangement results of [41]; see Section\n5 for a more detailed literature on star-shaped Bernoulli problem. However,\ntwo questions remain open: (i) Existence of a solution using Beurling's\nmethod, which, by uniqueness, would coincide with the variational one. (ii)\nThe best regularity one expects for the free boundary.\nThe paper is structured as follows: after recalling in Section 2 some\npreliminary results that will be used throughout the manuscript, we will\nconsider the exterior and interior problem in the convex setting, see Sections 3 and 4, respectively. Our problem will be then considered for starshaped domains in Section 5. In Section 6 we further extend the problem\nto more general cases, such as non-constant distance constraint (including a\nconstraint involving mean curvature), and two- and multi-phase problems.\nWe also give the proof of a Brunn-Minkowski inequality. In the last section\nwe show that the proposed model might give insights for new numerical algorithms that could more efficiently approximate solutions to the classical\nBernoulli problem. Several open and tantalizing problems are also outlined.\n\n3\n\n\f2\n\nPreliminaries\n\nFor the readers' convenience we briefly recall in this section the main existence and regularity properties for p-capacitary functions that will be used\nlater.\nFor 1 < p < \u221e, we define the p-Laplacian operator \u2206p as\n\u2206p u := div(|\u2207u|p\u22122 \u2207u),\n\n1 < p < \u221e,\n\nand the equation \u2206p u = 0 in \u03a9 is understood in the weak sense as\nZ\n|\u2207u|p\u22122 \u2207u\u2207\u03c6 = 0, \u2200 \u03c6 \u2208 W01,p (\u03a9).\n\u03a9\n\nWe first review some classical regularity properties:\nTheorem 2.1. Let U be a bounded domain in RN and u be a (weak) solution\nof \u2206p u = 0 in U . Then:\n1,\u03b1\ni. u \u2208 Cloc\n(U ), ([28, 62]),\n\nii. u satisfies the weak maximum principle and Hopf 's boundary lemma\n([61]).\nAdditional H\u00f6lder regularity up to the boundary can be shown through\nconstruction of conical barriers. With this objective in mind, we introduce\nsome notations: we say that a domain U satisfies a uniform exterior cone\ncondition if there exists a r0 > 0 such that for all x0 \u2208 \u2202U the finite right\ncircular cone Vx0 with vertex x0 and opening r0 satisfies U \u2229 Vx0 = {x0 } and\nVx0 \u2282 U c . One may analogously define the uniform interior cone condition.\nLemma 2.2 ([61]). Let U be a domain with exterior cone condition. Then\nthe solution of the Dirichlet problem with H\u00f6lder boundary data for the pLaplacian in U is a H\u00f6lder-continuous function up to \u2202U with H\u00f6lder norm\nuniformly bounded depending on r0 , supU |u| and R0 (radius of largest ball\nthat fits inside U ).\nWith some additional information on the regularity of \u2202U one can obtain\nhigher regularity for u up to \u2202U , in particular, uniform gradient bounds.\nLemma 2.3 ([48]). Let U be a C 1,\u03b1 domain in RN . Then any solution to\n\u2206p u = 0 in U is C 1,\u03b2 (U ) where \u03b2 depends on p, N and \u03b1.\n\n4\n\n\fFinally, we say that a set U satisfies the uniform interior ball condition\nif there exists r0 > 0 such that for each x \u2208 \u2202U , there exists zx \u2208 U with\nthe property that x \u2208 \u2202Br0 (zx ) \u2229 \u2202U and Br0 (zx ) \u2282 U .\nIn this paper we will be interested in the case that u is a p-capacitary\npotential in a convex annulus. Let K, \u03a9 be two domains in RN , N \u2265 2,\nsatisfying K \u2282 \u03a9, \u03a9 bounded. In the sequel we say that u\u03a9 is the pcapacitary potential of the ring shaped region \u03a9 \\ K if:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 \u2206p u\u03a9 = 0 in \u03a9 \\ K,\n(P\u03a9 )\nu = 1 on K,\n\uf8f3 \u03a9\nu\u03a9 = 0 on \u2202\u03a9.\n\nIt is clear that a domain \u03a9\\K, with \u03a9 and K convex, automatically\nsatisfies the uniform exterior cone condition, for some r0 depending only on\nK. Thus, the H\u00f6lder estimate from Lemma 2.2 will only depend on the\n(interior) cone condition for the domain K but not on \u03a9. We formulate this\nas a Corollary:\n\nCorollary 2.4. Let \u03a9, K be two bounded convex domains such that K \u2282\nK \u2282 \u03a9, and denote by u\u03a9 the p-capacitary potential of \u03a9\\K as given in\nequation (P\u03a9 ). Suppose that K satisfies the uniform interior cone condition\nfor opening r0 , and set d0 := dist(\u2202\u03a9, K). Then there is a constant M =\nM (r0 , d0 ) such that\nku\u03a9 kC \u03b1 (\u03a9\\K) \u2264 M.\nIf, in addition, K is C 1,1 , one can obtain uniform gradient estimates up\nto the boundary:\nCorollary 2.5. Let \u03a9, K be two bounded convex domains such that K \u2282 \u03a9,\nand denote by u\u03a9 the p-capacitary potential of \u03a9\\K as given in (P\u03a9 ). Suppose that K satisfies the uniform interior ball condition for radius r0 . Denote\nalso d0 = minx\u2208\u2202\u03a9 dist(x, K). Then there is a constant M = M (r0 , d0 ) such\nthat\n|\u2207u\u03a9 | \u2264 M in \u03a9\\K.\nNow we deal with the lower bounds for the gradient:\nLemma 2.6 (Lemma 2 in [46]). Let \u03a9, K be two bounded convex domains\nsuch that K \u2282 \u03a9 and denote by u\u03a9 the p-capacitary potential of \u03a9\\K as\ngiven in (P\u03a9 ). Suppose that \u03a9\\K satisfies the uniform interior ball condition\nfor radius r0 . There is a constant M0 such that\n|\u2207u\u03a9 | \u2265 M0\n5\n\nin\n\n\u03a9\\K.\n\n\fIf K is uniformly convex, it can be easily shown by constructing a suitable\nbarrier that the gradient of |\u2207u\u03a9 | near \u2202K must be bounded from below\nby a positive constant. If we do not have this extra information on K, but\nwe know the behavior near \u03a9, we can translate this information back to\nK. First we need to introduce some notation. For two nested convex sets\nK \u2282 \u03a9, and for x \u2208 \u2202K, we denote by Tx,a the supporting hyperplane at\nx with the normal a pointing away from K. Depending on the geometry of\n\u2202K, Tx,a is not necessarily unique. Now for each x \u2208 \u2202K there corresponds\na point yx , not necessarily unique, on \u2202\u03a9 \u2229 {z : a * (z \u2212 x) > 0} such that\na * (yx \u2212 x) = max a * (z \u2212 x), where the maximum has been taken over all\nz \u2208 \u2202\u03a9 \u2229 {z : a * (z \u2212 x) > 0}. Then, a crucial result is:\nLemma 2.7 (Lemma 2.2. in [37]). Let K and \u03a9 be two nested open convex\ndomains, K \u2282 \u03a9, and denote by u\u03a9 the p-capacitary potential of \u03a9\\K, as\ngiven in problem (P\u03a9 ). Then\nlim sup |\u2207u(z)| \u2265 lim sup |\u2207u(z)|\nz\u2192x\n\nz\u2192yx\n\nz\u2208\u03a9\\K\n\nz\u2208\u03a9\\K\n\nfor all x \u2208 \u2202K,\n\nwhere yx is the point indicated in the previous discussion.\nNext, a fundamental result on properties of level sets for p-capacitary\nfunctions u\u03a9 in a convex ring:\nProposition 2.8 ([46]). Let l \u2208 [0, 1). Given a convex ring \u03a9\\K, its pcapacitary function u\u03a9 described as above is real analytic and the level sets\n{u\u03a9 > l} are convex (with strictly positive principal curvatures) and analytic.\nFinally, a crucial technical result that allows to define the gradient of\nthe solution at the boundary of a convex ring, and thus, give a notion of\nclassical solutions for the usual Bernoulli problem:\nProposition 2.9 (Theorem 1.3 in [35]). Let K and \u03a9 be two nested open\nconvex domains, K \u2282 \u03a9, and denote by u\u03a9 the p-capacitary potential of\n\u03a9\\K, as given in problem (P\u03a9 ). Suppose also that \u2202K and \u2202\u03a9 are C 1 .\nThen \u2207u us semi-continuous in \u03a9\\K, and non-tangentially continuous up\nto \u2202\u03a9 \u222a \u2202K.\nFinally, we recall the definition of extremal points:\nDefinition 2.10. Let \u03a9 be a convex set: a point x \u2208 \u2202\u03a9 is an extremal point\nif x cannot be written as a linear combination of the form x = tx1 + (1\u2212 t)x2\nfor t \u2208 (0, 1), x1 , x2 \u2208 \u2202\u03a9.\n6\n\n\fIn the rest of the paper we denote by \u0393l the l level set of u:\n\u0393l := {x \u2208 \u03a9 | u(x) = l}.\nWe also write K \u22d0 \u03a9 when K \u2282 \u03a9.\n\n3\n\nThe exterior problem in convex setting\n\nThe first aim of this paper is to solve the following problem: given a convex\nopen bounded set K \u2282 RN , N \u2265 2, and l \u2208 (0, 1), \u03bb > 0 positive constants,\nfind a function u and a convex open bounded domain \u03a9 \u2282 RN , \u03a9 \u2283 K,\nsolving\n(\n\u2206p u = 0 in \u03a9 \\ K, u = 1 in K, u = 0 on \u2202\u03a9,\n(PE )\ndist(x, \u0393l ) = \u03bb for all x \u2208 \u2202\u03a9.\nWe first show:\nTheorem 3.1. Problem (PE ) has a unique regular solution (u, \u03a9) with \u03a9\nconvex, \u2202\u03a9 \u2208 C \u221e , and u \u2208 C 1,\u03b1 (\u03a9\\K) uniformly up to the boundary of \u03a9.\nThe proof is inspired by previous works of one of the authors [36, 37]\nvia Beurling's method (see also the classical reference [13]). The method is\nbased on constructions of super- and sub-solutions for (PE ); hence, existence\nof a solution for (PE ) follows by the proof of the existence of a minimal\nsuper-solution which turns out to be a subsolution (or solution) as well.\n\n3.1\n\nProof of existence\n\nWe first deal with the existence statement in Theorem 3.1. For each convex\nset \u03a9, let u\u03a9 be the p-capacitary potential of \u03a9\\K. Let us consider the class\nC := {\u03a9 convex bounded open set in RN , \u03a9 \u2283 K},\nand define the following three subsets:\nA\n\n= {\u03a9 \u2208 C | sup dist(x, \u0393l ) \u2264 \u03bb},\nx\u2208\u2202\u03a9\n\nA0 = {\u03a9 \u2208 C | inf dist(x, \u0393l ) < \u03bb},\nx\u2208\u2202\u03a9\n\nB\n\n= {\u03a9 \u2208 C | inf dist(x, \u0393l ) \u2265 \u03bb}.\nx\u2208\u2202\u03a9\n\nNote that A is the set of subsolutions, A0 the set of strict subsolutions,\nwhile B is the set of supersolutions for problem (PE ). Let us first check that\nthey are non-empty sets :\n7\n\n\fLemma 3.2. There exist a supersolution and a strict subsolution for problem (PE ).\nProof. By translation suppose that the origin of the cartesian system lies\ninside K. In order to construct a supersolution take 0 < r < R big enough\nsuch that K \u2282 Br (0). The solution of the capacitor problem for the annulus\nBR (0)\\Br (0) is explicitly given by function\n\u0010 \u0011\n\uf8f1\nR\n\uf8f4\nlog\n\uf8f4\n|x|\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 u(|x|) = log R \u0001 for p = N,\nr\np\u2212N\np\u2212N\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n|x| p\u22121 \u2212 R p\u22121\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nfor p 6= N.\n\uf8f3 u(|x|) = p\u2212N\np\u2212N\nr p\u22121 \u2212 R p\u22121\n\nIt is clear that we can have dist({\u016b = l}, {\u016b = 0}) as big as we wish by\nfixing r and taking R big enough. Consider also uR to be the p-capacitary\npotential of the set BR (0)\\K. By the comparison principle, uR \u2264 \u016b for all\nx \u2208 BR (0)\\Br (0). This immediately implies that\n(3.1)\n\ndist(x, {uR = l}) \u2265 \u03bb\n\nfor all x \u2208 \u2202BR (0),\n\nwhich shows that uR is a supersolution for our problem, i.e, BR (0) \u2208 B.\nNow we seek a strict subsolution. Let BR (0) and uR as above. Since\nK \u2282 BR (0), and uR is the p-capacitary potential in this annulus, we can\napply Lemma 2.6 to bound the gradient of uR from below. More precisely,\nthere exists a small neighborhood U of \u2202K and some \u03b1 > 0 such that\n(3.2)\n\n|\u2207uR (x)| \u2265 \u03b1 > 0 for all x \u2208 U \\K.\n\nChoose the level set {uR = 1 \u2212 \u03b5} and set U\u03b5 := {x : uR (x) > 1 \u2212 \u03b5} \u2229 U .\nDefine now\nuR (x) \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b5)\n.\nu\u03b5 (x) :=\n\u03b5\nThe function u\u03b5 (x) is a p-harmonic function in the domain U\u03b5 , u\u03b5 (x) = 0 in\n{uR (x) = 1 \u2212 \u03b5} and u\u03b5 (x) = 1 in K, so it is the p-capacitary potential of\nthe set U\u03b5 . We need to prove that u\u03b5 \u2208 A0 , i.e.,\nsup\n\ndist(x, {u\u03b5 = l}) < \u03bb.\n\nx\u2208{u\u03b5 =0}\n\nThis is easy to see since from the lower bound (3.2) it follows\ndist(x, {u\u03b5 = l}) \u2264\n\n\u03b5l\n< \u03bb,\n\u03b1\n\nby choosing \u03b5 small enough.\n8\n\nx \u2208 {u\u03b5 = 0},\n\n\fLemma 3.3. Let (uS , \u03a9S ) be any supersolution and (us , \u03a9s ) any subsolution\nfor problem (PE ). Then \u03a9s \u2282 \u03a9S and us \u2264 uS .\nProof. We use Lavrent'ev rescaling method. Assume by contradiction that\nthere is a subsolution (us , \u03a9s ) which is not smaller than a supersolution\n(uS , \u03a9S ). Without loss of generality, assume that 0 \u2208 K. Rescale the\nfunction us by a parameter \u03b5 < 1 small enough, i.e. u\u03b5s (x) = us ( x\u03b5 ), so that\nu\u03b5s is a p-capacitary function in \u03a9\u03b5s \\K\u03b5 for \u03a9\u03b5s \u2282 \u03a9S , K \u03b5 \u2282 K. Moreover, for\nall x \u2208 \u2202\u03a9\u03b5s ,\ndist(x, {u\u03b5s = l}) \u2264 \u03bb\u03b5 < \u03bb.\nConsider the biggest \u03b50 such that \u03a9\u03b5s0 \u2286 \u03a9S and \u2202\u03a9\u03b5s0 \u2229 \u2202\u03a9S 6= 0. Note\nthat we can take \u03b50 < 1 because \u03a9s 6= \u03a9S . Then, by strong comparison\nprinciple u\u03b5s \u2264 uS for each x \u2208 \u03a9\u03b5s0 \\K. Let x0 \u2208 \u2202\u03a9\u03b5s0 \u2229 \u2202\u03a9S : it holds that\n\u03bb > \u03bb\u03b5 \u2265 dist(x0 , {u\u03b5s = l}) \u2265 dist(x0 , {uS = l}) \u2265 \u03bb,\nwhich is a contradiction.\nThe next step in the application of Beurling's method is to show that\nthe set B is closed under intersection. This is the preparation step in order\nto show that the limit of a decreasing sequence of elements in B still belongs\nto B.\nLemma 3.4. Let \u03a91 and \u03a92 be two elements of B. It holds that\n\u03a91 \u2229 \u03a92 \u2208 B.\nProof. Let u\u03a91 \u2229\u03a92 be the solution of the p-capacitary problem in the intersection \u03a91 \u2229 \u03a92 . By application of the maximum principle in each of the\ndomains \u03a91 and \u03a92 , we can conclude that\nu\u03a91 \u2229\u03a92 (x) \u2264 min{u\u03a91 (x), u\u03a91 (x)},\n\nfor each x \u2208 \u03a91 \u2229 \u03a92 .\n\nMoreover, since \u03a91 \u2229 \u03a92 must contain K, the level set {u\u03a91 \u2229\u03a92 = l} is well\ndefined. Let x0 \u2208 {u\u03a91 \u2229\u03a92 = l} the point where the minimum distance\nbetween the sets \u2202(\u03a91 \u2229 \u03a92 ) and {u\u03a91 \u2229\u03a92 = l} is achieved. Then\nl = u\u03a91 \u2229\u03a92 (x0 ) \u2264 min{u\u03a91 (x0 ), u\u03a92 (x0 )},\nwhich implies that the point x0 is further away from both boundaries \u2202\u03a91\nand \u2202\u03a92 , in other words a distance greater than or equal to \u03bb.\n9\n\n\fNext lemma shows convergence of the sets \u03a9n .\nLemma 3.5. Let \u03a91 \u2283 \u03a92 \u2283 . . . be a decreasing sequence of convex domains\nin B, and suppose that the set \u03a9, defined the as interior of the closure \u2229\u03a9k ,\nis convex, bounded, open and \u03a9 \u2283 K. Then \u03a9 \u2208 B.\nProof. Let uk be the p-capacitary potential of \u03a9k \\K. By construction, 0 \u2264\nuk \u2264 1, and it is a decreasing sequence. Then we can easily show that on\nevery compact subset of \u03a9 := Interior(\u2229\u03a9k ), uk converges in C 1,\u03b1 norm to a\np-harmonic function u. However, the lack of control of the gradients at the\nboundary does not allow to show higher regularity up to the boundary, but\nonly C \u03b1 .\nWe first prove that u is precisely the solution to the p-capacitary problem\nin \u03a9\\K, denoted by u\u03a9 . Clearly, u \u2261 1 in K. We also need to check that\nu \u2261 0 outside \u03a9. For that, let x 6\u2208 \u03a9. Since K is convex, \u03a9k \\K automatically\nsatisfies the uniform exterior cone condition, and one may use Corollary 2.4\nto estimate\n(3.3)\n\n0 \u2264 uk (x) \u2264 dist(x, RN \\ \u03a9k )\u03b1 sup kuk kC \u03b1 (\u03a9\\K)\n\u2264 M dist(x, RN \\ \u03a9k )\u03b1 \u2192 0,\n\nas k \u2192 \u221e. This implies that u(x) = 0, as desired.\nSince the sequence of functions is decreasing, the set {uk = l} converges\nto the set where {u = l}. However the boundary of the set \u03a9k may not\nconverge to the set {u = 0}: that may happen if the gradient of u vanishes\nat some point of \u2202\u03a9 so that the limit function flattens out, and in this case\nthe distance property would be violated. As a consequence, we need to check\nthat u(x) > 0 for all x \u2208 \u03a9. By the minimum principle, u cannot vanish in\nthe interior, but it could happen that it vanishes at the boundary of some\nset \u03a9\u0303 \u2282 \u03a9. Hence assume by contradiction that \u03a9\u0303 6= \u03a9; consider a point\nx0 \u2208 \u2202 \u03a9\u0303, x0 6\u2208 \u03a9 and let P \u2208 {u = l} be the point where distance between x0\nand {u = l} achieves its minimum. It can happen that x0 = P but this is not\na problem in the argument. Note that the ball B\u03b5/2 (x0 ) is completely inside\n\u03a9k for all k (otherwise, the distance property for uk would be violated).\nMoreover uk (x) \u2192 0 as k \u2192 \u221e for all x \u2208 B\u03b5/2 (x0 ) \\ (B\u03b5/2 (x0 ) \u2229 \u03a9\u0303). Cover\nthe segment x0 P by a finite number of balls of radius \u03b5/2, and define S =\ni\n\u222aN\ni=0 B\u03b5/2 (x ). In the set S the Harnack inequality applied to the function\nuk implies\nl = u(P ) \u2264 uk (P ) \u2264 sup uk (x) \u2264 C inf uk (x),\nS\n\n10\n\nS\n\n\fwhere C depends only on S. But this is a contradiction since, as k \u2192 \u221e, it\nholds\nl \u2264 C inf uk (x) \u2192 0.\nS\n\nWe have shown that \u03a9\u0303 = \u03a9, so that u > 0 on \u03a9. Then u = u\u03a9 is the\np-capacitary potential for the set \u03a9\\K. Moreover the set \u03a9 belongs to B\nsince\n(3.4)\n\n\u03bb \u2264 dist(\u2202\u03a9n , {un = l}) \u2192 dist(\u2202\u03a9, {u = l})\n\nas n \u2192 +\u221e.\n\nNote here that the passage to the limit is justified because \u2202\u03a9n \u2192 \u2202\u03a9 and\n{un = l} \u2192 {u = l} in the Hausdorff distance sense.\nThe previous two lemmas allow us to find a minimal set \u03a9 in B, i.e., the\nsolution u will be the minimal supersolution, that stays above the strict subsolution we have found in Lemma 3.2. More precisely we have the following\ncorollary:\nCorollary 3.6. Assume that there exist two domains \u03a90 \u2208 A0 and \u03a91 \u2208 B,\nwith \u03a90 \u2282 \u03a91 . Set\nS := {\u03a9 \u2208 B : \u03a90 \u2282 \u03a9}.\nThen there exists a domain \u03a9 in the class S which is minimal for the inclusion.\nProof. Let \u03a9\u0303 be the intersection of all domains in the class S and set \u03a9 to\nbe the interior of the closure of \u03a9\u0303, which is still convex. To prove \u03a9 \u2208 B,\nwe select a sequence of domains {Uk }\u221e\nk=1 in S such that \u2229Uk = \u03a9\u0303. Consider\nthe sequence of domains defined by \u03a91 = U1 and \u03a9k+1 = \u03a9k \u2229 Uk+1 for\nk \u2265 1. Each \u03a9k is convex and because of Lemma 3.4 belongs to B. Lemma\n3.5 completes the proof of the corollary.\nIn the following, we always denote by \u03a9 the (non-trivial) minimal element\nin the class S defined in the previous proposition. To finalize the proof of\nthe theorem we need to check that this minimal set satisfies the distance\nproperty so it is indeed the solution of (PE ).\nProof of Theorem 3.1:\nWe need to show that \u03a9, the minimal set of B, and its corresponding pcapacitor potential u\u03a9 satisfy the distance property:\ndist(x, {u\u03a9 = l}) = \u03bb\n\n11\n\nfor all\n\nx \u2208 \u2202\u03a9.\n\n\fThe proof for the standard Bernoulli problem uses crucially the convexity\nassumption. Our problem may be solved through a different and much\nsimpler argument, which may be extended to more complex geometries, for\ninstance, the star-shaped case. By contradiction, suppose that there is a\npoint x0 \u2208 \u2202\u03a9 such that\ndist({u\u03a9 = l}, x0 ) = \u03bb + \u03b5,\n\n\u03b5 > 0.\n\nSet L := {u\u03a9 > l}. Note that L\\K is a convex ring. Define \u03a9\u0303 as the set\n\u03a9\u0303 := {x \u2208 \u03a9 : dist(x, L) < \u03bb},\nwith \u0169 the p-capacitary potential of \u03a9\u0303\\K. By the hypothesis, \u03a9\u0303 $ \u03a9, and\nhence the comparison principle gives that \u0169 \u2264 u. One may estimate, for\nx \u2208 \u2202 \u03a9\u0303, that\ndist(x, {\u0169 = l}) \u2265 dist(x, {u = l}) \u2265 \u03bb.\nSince \u2202 \u03a9\u0303 lies at fixed distance \u03bb from L, and L is a convex bounded set, we\ncan conclude that also \u03a9\u0303 is convex. Hence \u03a9\u0303 belongs to the set B; but this\ncontradicts the fact that \u03a9 is the minimal set in B.\nLemma 3.7. Assume that K is star-shaped. If problem (PE ) admits a\nsolution, then it is unique.\nProof. It is a consequence of Lemma 3.3, since a solution is at the same time\na sub- and a super-solution.\nRemark 3.8. The uniqueness result together with the constructive construction of \u03a9 as intersection of convex sets give that the solution \u03a9 of problem\n(PE ) must be convex.\nWe look now at regularity. It is clear that u \u2208 C \u221e (\u03a9\\K) and even\nanalytic in the interior of \u03a9\\K, but what about the regularity of the free\nboundary? First note that {u = l} is level set of an analytic function, hence\nit is analytic. Moreover all the normal curvatures at the level set are positive\n(Lemma 2.8). The level set {u = 0} is at a fixed distance \u03bb from {u = l} and\n\u03bci\n, where \u03bci are the curvatures of {u = l};\nits curvatures are of the form 1+\u03bb\u03bc\ni\nhence we can conclude [31] that {u = 0} is also C \u221e and analytic.\nThe proof of Theorem 3.1 is thus completed.\n\n12\n\n\f3.2\n\nConvergence to the Bernoulli problem\n\nFinally, we show that the discrete Bernoulli problem converges, at the limit,\nto the usual Bernoulli problem:\nTheorem 3.9. Let ln and \u03bbn be two decreasing sequences of positive numbers such that ln \u2192 0, \u03bbn \u2192 0 as n \u2192 +\u221e and ln = \u03bbn \u03c9. Let (un , \u03a9n )\nbe the solution of the exterior problem (PE ) with constants l = ln and\n\u03bb = \u03bbn . As n \u2192 \u221e, {\u03a9n } is a decreasing sequence of sets converging in\nHausdordff distance to some convex set \u03a9 and the function un converges in\nC 1,\u03b1 (\u03a9\\K) \u2229 C \u03b1 (\u03a9\\K) to the (unique) solution u of the classical Bernoulliloc\ntype problem\n(\n\u2206p u = 0 in \u03a9 \\ K, u = 1 in K, u = 0 on \u2202\u03a9,\n(PB )\n|\u2207u| = \u03c9, for all x \u2208 \u2202\u03a9.\nThe boundary condition |\u2207u| = \u03c9 is to be understood in the following sense:\n(3.5)\n\nlim inf |\u2207u(y)| = lim sup |\u2207u(u)| = \u03c9,\n\ny\u2192x,y\u2208\u03a9\n\nfor every x \u2208 \u2202\u03a9.\n\ny\u2192x,y\u2208\u03a9\n\nRemark 3.10. It is shown in [37] that the solution for the Bernoulli problem\n(PB ) exists, it is unique if K is bounded, and has C 2,\u03b1 boundary \u2202\u03a9.\nProof. Define the rescaled distance function\ndn (x) = ln [1 \u2212 dist(x, {un = ln })/\u03bbn ].\nClearly, when x \u2208 \u2202\u03a9n \u222a {un = ln } we have that dn (x) = un (x). Define also\nSn := {0 \u2264 un \u2264 ln }, a narrow ring. Since the level sets of un are convex\nsurfaces, the function dn is p-superharmonic in the set Sn , i.e,\n\u2212\u2206p dn \u2265 0.\nSince dn and un have the same boundary values on \u2202Sn , comparison principle\nyields that un \u2264 dn everywhere in Sn . In particular, one obtains that for\nx \u2208 \u2202\u03a9n , and lm \u2264 ln ,\ndist(x, {un = lm }) \u2265 dist(x, {dn = lm }).\nOn the other hand for any x \u2208 {0 \u2264 dn \u2264 ln } it holds |\u2207dn (x)| = \u03c9. Since\n0 \u2264 lm \u2264 ln ,\ndist(x, {dn = lm }) \u2265\n\nlm\nlm\n=\n= \u03bbm\nsup |\u2207dn |\n\u03c9\n13\n\nfor all\n\nm \u2265 n.\n\n\fThus, un is a supersolution for every problem (PE ) with constants (\u03bbm , lm ),\nm \u2265 n, i.e., \u03a9n \u2208 Bm where\nBm := {\u03a9 \u2208 C | inf dist(x, {u\u03a9 = lm }) \u2265 \u03bbm },\nx\u2208\u2202\u03a9\n\nfor all m \u2265 n. Because of our construction of the solution for the exterior\nproblem with constants (\u03bbm , lm ) as the minimal set in Bm , this immediately\ngives that \u03a9n contains all the \u03a9m for m \u2265 n. Consequently we have shown\nthat the sequence of {\u03a9n }\u221e\nn=0 is decreasing and from maximum principle it\nfollows that {un } is a decreasing sequence.\nSince un \u2264 dn on Sn , using Hopf's boundary lemma we arrive at |\u2207un | \u2264\n|\u2207dn | = \u03c9 on \u2202\u03a9n . This tells us that un is a supersolution for the Bernoulli\nproblem with constant \u03c9 in the sense indicated in [37].\nAs a consequence, the sequence of sets \u03a9n converges (for example in the\nHausdorff measure) as n \u2192 \u221e towards a convex domain \u03a9 \u2283 K. Moreover\n1,\u03b1\nun converges in Cloc\n-norm to a p-harmonic function u: by Theorem 3.2\nin [37] we know that u solves the p-capacitary problem in \u03a9 \\ K and is a\nsupersolution, i.e., |\u2207u| \u2264 \u03c9 for all x in \u2202\u03a9.\nThe last step consists of showing that (u, \u03a9) solves the Bernoulli problem\n(PB ) with constant \u03c9 in the sense indicated in (3.5). Use again comparison\nto the distance function, we obtain that |\u2207un | \u2265 \u03c9 on the level set {un = ln }.\nBut Lemma 2.7 gives that the inequality |\u2207un | \u2265 \u03c9 is also true for every\npoint in {ln \u2264 u < 1}. Since we have uniform convergence of the gradients\naway from the boundary and the sequence of sets \u03a9n \u2192 \u03a9 is decreasing, we\nare able to pass to the limit and thus |\u2207u(y)| \u2265 \u03c9 for every point y \u2208 \u03a9\\K.\nThe proof of the Theorem is completed.\n\n4\n\nThe interior problem in convex setting\n\nWe consider now the following problem: given a convex open bounded set\n\u03a9 \u2282 RN for N \u2265 2 and l \u2208 (0, 1), \u03bb > 0, find a function u and a convex\nopen bounded domain K \u2282 \u03a9 such that\n(\n\u2206p u = 0 in \u03a9 \\ K, u = 0 in K, u = 1 in \u2202\u03a9,\n(PI )\ndist(x, \u0393l ) = \u03bb, for all x \u2208 \u2202K.\nOur first main result for the interior case is the following.\nTheorem 4.1. There exists a constant \u03bb\u03a9,max that depends only on l and\n\u03a9 such that for any \u03bb \u2264 \u03bb\u03a9,max problem (PI ) has a smooth solution (u, K)\nwith K a convex set and \u2202K \u2208 C 0,1 .\n14\n\n\fFor each convex set K, one can define its associated p-capacitary potential uK as the solution of the following problem:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u2206p uK = 0 in \u03a9 \\ K,\n(PK )\nuK = 0 in K,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nuK = 1 on \u2202\u03a9.\n\nNote that, without risk of confusion, we have switched the notation from\nproblem (P\u03a9 ) in the exterior case.\nThe proof of Theorem 4.1 goes, as in the exterior case, by considering\nthe maximal element in the class:\n\n(4.1)\n\nB\u03bb = {K convex bounded open set,\n\u03a9 \u2283 K | inf dist(x, {uK = l}) \u2265 \u03bb}.\nx\u2208\u2202K\n\nIn the following we show that, fixed l \u2208 (0, 1), the set B is non-empty if the\nvalue of \u03bb is smaller than a certain critical value, which will be denoted by\n\u03bb\u03a9,max . We also show that problem (PI ) does not necessarily have a unique\nsolution for certain values of \u03bb.\n\n4.1\n\nA minimal supersolution and the Bernoulli constant\n\nAs a motivation, consider the simple case that \u03a9 is a ball: such particular\nexample shows, as in the case of the classical Bernoulli problem, the existence\nof a constant \u03bb\u03a9,max such that no solution exists for \u03bb > \u03bb\u03a9,max , one or two\nsolutions can occur for \u03bb < \u03bb\u03a9,max and only one solution exists if \u03bb = \u03bb\u03a9,max .\nUsing Beurling's terminology, we call the unique solution that corresponds to\nthe value \u03bb = \u03bb\u03a9,max of parabolic type, the smallest solution for \u03bb < \u03bb\u03a9,max\nof hyperbolic type and the biggest solution for \u03bb < \u03bb\u03a9,max of elliptic type.\nThe elliptic solutions form a decreasing family, while the hyperbolic solutions\nform a increasing family of solutions.\nLemma 4.2. Let \u03a9 = BR (0) \u2282 RN be a ball with radius R. Fixed l \u2208 (0, 1)\nand p > 1, we have that:\ni. If p \u2264 N , there exists a constant \u03bbmax depending on l and R such\nthat problem (PI ) has a unique solution for \u03bb = \u03bbmax , two solutions if\n0 < \u03bb < \u03bbmax and no solutions if \u03bb > \u03bbmax .\nii. If p > N , then there exist constants \u03bbmax and \u03bbmin depending on l, p\nand R such that problem (PI ) has a unique solution for \u03bb \u2208 (0, \u03bbmin ) \u222a\n{\u03bbmax }, two solutions if \u03bb \u2208 (\u03bbmin , \u03bbmax ) and no solutions if \u03bb >\n\u03bbmax .\n15\n\n\fProof. It has been shown in [57] that all the solutions of the p-capacitary\nproblem with \u03a9 = BR (0) are balls centered in the origin. We deal first with\nthe case N = p. Given any r with 0 < r < R, the unique solution ur of the\np-capacitary problem with \u03a9 = BR (0) and K = Br (0) reads as follows:\nlog(R) \u2212 log(|x|)\n.\nlog(R) \u2212 log(r)\n\nur (|x|) = 1 \u2212\nIt holds\nur (|x|) = l\n\nif and only if\n\n|x| = Rl r 1\u2212l ,\n\nand consequently\n\u039b(r) := dist(x, {ur = l}) = r\n\n\u0001\nR l\nr\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\u22121\n\nfor all x \u2208 \u2202Br (0).\n\nWe note here that \u039b(r) + r \u2264 R for r \u2208 (0, R) so ur is an admissible solution\nfor the p-capacitary problem in the annulus.\nWith elementary computations one can check that \u039b(r) reaches its maximum value at\n(4.2)\n\n1\n\nrmax := R (1 \u2212 l) l\n\nwith\n\n\u039b(rmax ) = R\n\n(1 \u2212 l)1/l\n=: \u03bbmax .\n(1/l \u2212 1)\n\nWe may easily compute \u039b(0) = 0, \u039b(R) = 0, and \u039b(r) is strictly increasing\nfor 0 < r < rmax , strictly decreasing for rmax < r < R. This implies that for\nany \u03bb \u2208 (0, \u03bbmax ) there exist two values r\u03bb,1 < rmax < r\u03bb,2 < R such that\nboth solutions ui , i = 1, 2 of the p-capacitary problems in BR (0) \\ Br\u03bb,i (0)\nsatisfy dist(x, {ui = l}) = \u03bb for all x \u2208 \u2202Bri (0) for i = 1, 2. Moreover,\nthere exists a unique solution for \u03bbmax , and no solutions in the remaining\ncase. This completes the proof of the lemma for the case p = N .\nOn the other hand, when p 6= N the p-capacitary potential is given by\np\u2212N\n\nur (|x|) =\n\np\u2212N\n\nr p\u22121 \u2212 |x| p\u22121\np\u2212N\n\np\u2212N\n\n,\n\nr p\u22121 \u2212 R p\u22121\nand, keeping the same notation as above,\n\np\u22121\nh\np\u2212N\np\u2212N i p\u2212N\np\u22121\np\u22121\n\u039b(r) = (1 \u2212 l)r\n+ lR\n\u2212 r.\n\nBut again, \u039b(r) + r \u2264 R, so ur is indeed an admissible solution in the\nannulus.\n16\n\n\fNext, \u039b(r) reaches its maximum value at\nrmax := R\n\n\"\n\nN\u2212p\n\n# p\u22121\n\np\u2212N\n\nl\n(1 \u2212 l) N\u22121 \u2212 (1 \u2212 l)\n\n.\n\nNote that \u039b is an increasing function in the interval (0, rmax ), decreasing\np\u22121\n\nat (rmax , R), \u039b(R) = 0 and \u039b(0) = l p\u2212N R > 0 if p > N and \u039b(0) = 0 for\np < N.\nWe set \u03bbmin := \u039b(0) and\n(4.3)\n\uf8ee\n! p\u22121 \uf8f9\n\u0013 p\u22121\n\u0012\np\u2212N\np\u2212N\nl\nl\n\uf8fb.\n\u2212\n\u03bbmax := \u039b(rmax ) = R \uf8f0\np\u22121\nN\u2212p\n1\u2212(1\u2212l) N\u22121\n\n(1\u2212l) N\u22121 \u2212(1\u2212l)\n\nThis completes the proof of the lemma.\n\nNow we go back to the problem (PI ) for a general convex bounded set \u03a9\nin RN and a fixed l \u2208 (0, 1) (although we may not write it, the dependence\nin l will be always implicit). Consider the set of supersolutions as defined\nin (4.1). Since B\u03bb1 \u2282 B\u03bb2 for \u03bb1 > \u03bb2 , we can define the Bernoulli constant\nfor our problem as\n(4.4)\n\n\u03bb\u03a9,max := sup{\u03bb > 0 | B\u03bb is not empty}.\n\nA possible bound from below for \u03bb\u03a9,max is given by the next lemma.\nLemma 4.3. Let l \u2208 (0, 1) and \u03a9 be any open bounded convex set, then\n\u03bb\u03a9,max \u2265 \u03bbmax ,\nwhere \u03bbmax is defined in (4.2) if p = N and (4.3) if p 6= N , and R is the\nradius of the largest ball inscribed in \u03a9.\nProof. According to Theorem 4.1 and the definition in (4.4), problem (PI ) is\nsolvable for given constants \u03bb > 0, l \u2208 (0, 1), provided that B\u03bb 6= \u2205. Following the discussion above, for any \u03bb \u2264 \u039b(rmax ) there exists a unique constant\nr\u03bb,2 , with rmax \u2264 r\u03bb,2 < R such that the solution of the p-capacitary problem\nur\u03bb,2 in BR (0) \\ Br\u03bb,2 (0) satisfies the distance property:\ndist(x, {ur\u03bb,2 = l}) = \u03bb\n\nfor all x \u2208 \u2202Br\u03bb,2 (0).\n\nNote that if \u03bb = D(rmax ) then rmax = r\u03bb,2 .\n17\n\n\fFor any \u03bb \u2264 D(rmax ) consider now the solution \u016b of the p-capacitary\nproblem in \u03a9 \\ Br\u03bb,2 (0). By comparison principle applied to the functions\nur\u03bb,2 and \u016b, the (minimum) distance between the sets {\u016b = l} and \u2202Br\u03bb,2 (0)\nis greater or equal \u03bb. This shows that \u016b is a supersolution for (PI ), as\nstated.\nCorollary 4.4. Fix l \u2208 (0, 1) and \u03a9 a convex bounded domain in RN . Then,\nfor each \u03bb \u2264 \u03bb\u03a9,max , there exists a supersolution (u, K) such that K belongs\nto the class B\u03bb .\nProof. Indeed, we have just seen that if x0 \u2208 \u03a9 and R the radius of the\nlargest ball centered at x0 inscribed in \u03a9, then for \u03bb \u2264 \u03bb\u03a9,max the solution\n\u016b constructed in Lemma 4.2 is a supersolution of the problem and indeed\nits zero set K := Br\u03bb,2 (0) belongs to the class B\u03bb .\nRemark 4.5. Because of the distance property, for any K \u2208 B\u03bb , we have\nthat\ndist(x, \u2202\u03a9) \u2265 \u03bb for any x \u2208 \u2202K,\nwhich shows that any element in the class B\u03bb is strictly contained in \u03a9 and\nthus, non-degenerate.\nWe have just shown that for any \u03bb \u2264 \u03bb\u03a9,max the set B\u03bb is not empty.\nObviously it holds that B\u03bb2 \u2282 B\u03bb1 if \u03bb1 \u2264 \u03bb2 . We first define the maximal\nset as\n\u0010[\n\u0011\n(4.5)\nK ,\nK\u03bb := C\nK\u2208B\u03bb\n\nand will prove that K\u03bb satisfies the distance problem (PI ) with constants\n(\u03bb, l). Here C (X) denotes the closed convex hull of the set X.\nIt is an interesting open question to see if for general convex domains\n\u03a9 the set of all solutions of problem (PI ) follows the same structure as the\nball case, i.e. parabolic, elliptic and hyperbolic case; in particular to prove\nthat the family of maximal convex solutions defined above is an elliptic\n(i.e. decreasing and continuous) family of solutions and that there exists\na unique solution corresponding to the value \u03bb = \u03bb\u03a9,max . These questions\nhave been already addressed for the classical Bernoulli problem and proven\nto be true for the linear case p = 2, [3, 21] and for p 6= 2 more recently in [15].\nBefore we prove Theorem 4.1, let us show a couple of preparatory lemmas:\n\n18\n\n\fLemma 4.6. Let K1 and K2 be two elements of B\u03bb . It holds that\nK \u2217 \u2208 B\u03bb ,\nwhere K \u2217 is the convex hull of the set K1 \u222a K2 .\nProof. Let u\u2217 be the solution of the p-capacitary problem in \u03a9 \\ K \u2217 . Since\nthe set K \u2217 is strictly contained in \u03a9, the level set {u\u2217 = l} is well defined.\nLet x0 \u2208 {u\u2217 = l} and x1 \u2208 \u2202K \u2217 be the points where the minimum distance\nbetween the sets \u2202K \u2217 and {u\u2217 = l} is attained. We would like to show that\ndist(x0 , x1 ) \u2265 \u03bb.\nFirst, by application of the maximum principle we can quickly conclude\nthat\nu\u2217 (x) \u2264 min{uK1 (x), uK2 (x)}, for each x \u2208 \u03a9,\nwhich, in particular, implies that\nl = u\u2217 (x0 ) \u2264 min{uK1 (x0 ), uK2 (x0 )}.\nBecause, by initial hypothesis, uK1 and uK2 are supersolutions of the problem (PI ) in the sense of (4.1), one knows right away that every point in\n{u\u2217 = l} is far from both boundaries \u2202K1 and \u2202K2 a distance greater or\nequal than \u03bb, and in particular the same is true for x0 . We have just shown\nthat if we set K := K1 \u222a K2 , then\n(4.6)\n\ndist(x0 , \u2202K) \u2265 \u03bb.\n\nOn the other hand, we have constructed K \u2217 as the convex hull of K.\nIf x1 is an extremal point of K \u2217 , then it belongs also to \u2202K which implies\nthat dist(x0 , x1 ) \u2265 \u03bb by (4.6). If x1 is not an extremal point of K \u2217 , it can\nbe written as a linear combination of points {yi }ni=1 that are extremal for\nK. For such points we have already shown that dist(yi , {u\u2217 = l}) \u2265 \u03bb. But\nbecause the set {u\u2217 = l} is the boundary of a convex set by Proposition 2.8\none automatically obtains that dist(x1 , x0 ) \u2265 \u03bb too.\nLemma 4.7. Let K1 \u2282 K2 \u2282 . . . be a increasing sequence of convex domains\nin B\u03bb , and suppose that the set K, defined as interior of the closure \u222aKn ,\nis convex, bounded, open and \u03a9 \u2283 K. Then K \u2208 B\u03bb .\nProof. Let un be the p-capacitary potential of \u03a9\\Kn . By construction,\n0 \u2264 un \u2264 1, and {un } is a decreasing sequence. Then we can easily show that\non every compact subset of \u03a9, un converges in C 1,\u03b1 norm to a p-harmonic\nfunction u. We first prove that u is precisely the solution to the p-capacitary\n19\n\n\fproblem in \u03a9\\K, denoted by uK . Clearly, u \u2261 1 on \u2202\u03a9. We also need to\ncheck that u \u2261 0 in K. For that, let x \u2208 K \\ Kn . Since K is convex, \u03a9\\Kn\nautomatically satisfies the uniform exterior cone condition, and one may use\nCorollary 2.4 to get a uniform (in n) C \u03b1 estimate up to the boundary, hence\n0 \u2264 un (x) \u2264 dist(x, Kn )\u03b1 sup kun kC \u03b1 (\u03a9\\K) \u2264 M dist(x, Kn )\u03b1 \u2192 0\nas n \u2192 \u221e. This implies that u(x) = 0 for all x \u2208 K, as desired.\nNote that, because we have a decreasing sequence of functions, the set\n{un = l} converges to the set where {u = l}. However, the boundary of the\nset Kn may not converge to the set {u = 0}, and this may happen if the\ngradient of un grows in some neighborhood of \u2202K. Hence we need to check\nthat u(x) > 0 for all x \u2208 \u03a9 \\ K. Assume that K \u2282 K\u0303 and u = 0 in K\u0303. This\nis done again by a Harnack chain argument: let x0 \u2208 \u2202 K\u0303 and P \u2208 {u = l}\nbe two points such that\ndist(x0 , P ) \u2264 \u03bb \u2212 \u03b5\n\nfor some \u03b5 > 0.\n\nSince Kn satisfies the exterior ball condition, the ball B\u03b5/2 (x0 ) is completely\noutside Kn for all n. Moreover, un (xn ) \u2192 0 for all x \u2208 B\u03b5/2 (x0 ) as n \u0580 \u221e.\nCover the segment x0 P by a finite number of balls of radius \u03b5/2, and\ndefine S = \u222aN\ni=1 B\u03b5/2 (xi ). In the set S, Harnack inequality applied to the\nfunction un implies\nl = u(P ) \u2264 un (P ) \u2264 sup un (x) \u2264 C inf un (x),\nS\n\nS\n\nwhere C depends only on S. But this is a contradiction, since as n \u0580 \u221e,\nl \u2264 C inf un (x) \u2192 0.\nS\n\nWe have shown that, necessarily, K\u0303 = K, so that u > 0 on \u03a9 \\ K. Then\nu = uK is the p-capacitor potential for the set \u03a9\\K. Moreover K belongs\nto B\u03bb ; the proof follows the same argument as in (3.4) with \u03a9n replaced by\nKn .\nNow we check that the maximal set found in the previous lemma satisfies\nthe distance property. Such maximal set provides the solution for problem\n(PI ), and thus the proof of Theorem 4.1 is almost complete.\nLemma 4.8. Assume that B\u03bb is non-empty. Let K be the maximal set of\nB\u03bb found in the previous lemma and let uK be the corresponding solution of\nthe p-capacitor problem for \u03a9\\K. It holds\ndist(x, {uK = l}) = \u03bb\n20\n\nfor all\n\nx \u2208 \u2202K.\n\n\fProof. We know that both the sets \u2202K and {u = l} are convex (the second one is convex by Lemma 2.8). Then one just needs to understand the\ndistance between two convex sets. By construction, we know that for all\nx \u2208 \u2202K.\n(4.7)\n\ndist({uK = l}, x) \u2265 \u03bb.\n\nSuppose that there is a point x0 \u2208 \u2202K such that\ndist({uK = l}, x0 ) = \u03bb + \u03b5.\nThen one can consider the convex set K\u0303 = {x \u2208 \u03a9 : dist(x, {uK = l})} = \u03bb.\nLet \u0169 be the p-capacitary solution in K\u0303; clearly \u0169 < uK by the strong\nmaximum principle. Then, if x \u2208 \u2202 K\u0303,\ndist(x, {\u0169 = l}) \u2265 dist(x, {uK = l}) \u2265 \u03bb,\nwhich shows that K\u0303 is in the class B\u03bb , which contradicts the maximality of\nK.\nConclusion of the proof of Theorem 4.1: We have already seen that for\nany \u03bb < \u03bb\u03a9,max , the set B\u03bb is nonempty and thus there exists a solution for\n(PI ). It remains to check that this is so for \u03bb = \u03bb\u03a9,max .\nLet \u03bbk be a sequence converging to \u03bb\u03a9,max from below. We have just\nshown that for each \u03bbk , there exists a convex solution Kk . One can subtract\na subsequence, still denoted by Kk , which converges to a convex domain K in\nthe Hausdorff topology. Then, by Arzela-Ascoli, the p-capacitary potential\nuk of \u03a9\\Kk converges to u, the p-capacitary potential of \u03a9\\K. We have also\nshown that the distance from the l-level set of uk is at a distance \u03bbk , then\npassing to the limit we also see that the same holds for u (similar argument\nas before).\nRemark 4.9. In contrast to the exterior problem studied before, in the interior discrete Bernoulli problem the free boundary may have corners; consequently \u2202K is only C 0,1 and the solution is C 0,\u03b1 up to the boundary.\n\n4.2\n\nConvergence to the Bernoulli problem\n\nBefore we state the main theorem of the section, let us recall what is known\nfor the interior Bernoulli problem:\n\n21\n\n\fTheorem 4.10 ([36]). Given a convex domain \u03a9, there exists a constant \u03c90\ndepending on \u03a9 and p such that for all \u03c9 \u2265 \u03c90 the Bernoulli-type problem\n(\n\u2206p v = 0 in \u03a9 \\ D, v = 0 in D, v = 1 in \u2202\u03a9,\n(PBI )\n|\u2207v| = \u03c9 for all x \u2208 \u2202D,\nhas a solution (v, D) (not necessarily unique). Moreover D is convex. The\nboundary condition |\u2207v| = \u03c9 is again understood in the sense of (3.5).\nRemark 4.11. We remind the reader that the solution (v, D) given in the\nprevious theorem is the one constructed as the extremal supersolution for\nproblem (PBI ), although there may be others. The set of supersolutions for\neach fixed \u03c9 is defined in [36] as the class of Lipschitz functions in \u03a9 such\nthat v = 1 on \u2202\u03a9, \u2206p v \u2264 0 in {v > 0} \u2229 \u03a9 and |\u2207v| \u2264 \u03c9 on \u2202{v > 0} \u2229 \u03a9.\nNow, the main theorem of this section is:\nTheorem 4.12. Let \u03a9 be a bounded convex domain in RN . Let \u03c9 > \u03c90 ,\nwhere \u03c90 is the Bernoulli constant for the domain \u03a9 given in Theorem 4.10.\nFix two decreasing sequences {ln } and {\u03bbn } of positive numbers such that\nln \u2192 0, \u03bbn \u2192 0 as n \u2192 +\u221e and ln = \u03bbn \u03c9. Let also \u03bbn\u03a9,max be the\ncorresponding quantity (4.4) to each ln . Then:\n\u2022 There exists a solution (v, D) for the interior Bernoulli problem (PBI )\nwith constant \u03c9.\n\u2022 There exists a sequence of solutions (un , Kn ) of problem (PI ) for each\nl = ln , \u03bb = \u03bbn .\n\u2022 The sequence of convex sets {Kn } is decreasing and as n \u2192 \u221e converges in Hausdorff distance to the convex set D.\n1,\u03b1\n\u2022 In addition, the function un converges in Cloc\n(\u03a9\\D) \u2229 C \u03b1 (\u03a9\\D) to v.\n\nThe proof of the theorem will be a consequence of the following claims:\nClaim 1: The existence of a solution for the Bernoulli problem with\nconstant \u03c9 > \u03c90 is the statement of Theorem 4.10.\nClaim 2: For each n, there exists a solution (un , Kn ) to the interior\nproblem (PI ) with constants \u03bb = \u03bbn and l = ln .\nThe proof of this claim uses the following lemma on the relation between\nthe solvability of the distance problem and the Bernoulli one:\n\n22\n\n\fLemma 4.13. Given a convex bounded domain \u03a9 and l \u2208 (0, 1), the Bernoulli\nconstant defined in (4.4) for the distance problem satisfies\n\u03bb\u03a9,max \u2265\n\n(4.8)\n\nl\n,\n\u03c90\n\nwhere \u03c90 is the Bernoulli constant from Theorem 4.10.\nProof. As in the proof of Lemma 4.3, it is enough to show that any solution\n(v, D) for the Bernoulli problem (PB ) with constant \u03c90 is also a supersolution for (PI ) for \u03bb \u2264 \u03c9l0 . Indeed, the Bernoulli condition for v tells us that\n|\u2207v| = \u03c90 on \u2202D, which implies that |\u2207v| \u2264 \u03c90 in \u03a9\\D because of Lemma\n2.7. Then, if x \u2208 \u2202D,\n(4.9)\n\ndist(x, {v = l}) \u2265\n\nl\nl\n=\n\u2265 \u03bb,\nsup |\u2207v|\n\u03c90\n\nwhich implies D \u2208 B\u03bb .\nUsing the lemma for the domain \u03a9 and the level ln we may estimate\n\u03bbn\u03a9,max \u2265\n\nln\nln\n= \u03bbn ,\n\u2265\n\u03c90\n\u03c9\n\nwhich tells us that the distance problem (PI ) with constants (\u03bbn , ln ) may\nbe solved (Theorem 4.1). This proves Claim 2.\nClaim 3: Kn is a decreasing sequence of sets. In particular, we have that\nu = supn un and K = \u2229n Kn , where (un , Kn ) is the solution to the distance\nproblem (PI ) with constants \u03bb = \u03bbn , l = ln .\nFix m \u2264 n, so that ln \u2264 lm and \u03bbn \u2264 \u03bbm . Let us check first that un\nbelongs to the set of supersolutions Bm , defined as\nBm := {K \u2282 \u03a9 | inf dist(x, {uK = lm }) \u2265 \u03bbm }.\nx\u2208\u2202K\n\nFor that, consider the distance function dn between two level sets of un ,\nrescaled by a factor \u03c9, so that dn and un have the same boundary values in\nthe set Sn := {0 \u2264 un \u2264 ln }. More precisely,\n(4.10)\n\ndn (x) = ln [1 \u2212 dist(x, {un = ln })/\u03bbn ].\n\nSince the level set {un = ln } is smooth, the distance function is smooth\n(a reference for the regularity of distance functions may be found in [31]).\n23\n\n\fNote that in order to have dn well defined outside Sn , we need to take the\ndistance function to the level set dist(x, {ln = un }) with a change of sign\nonce we pass the level set.\nNext, since the level sets of un are convex surfaces (see Lemma 2.8), the\ndistance function defined in the set Sn is p-subharmonic, i.e.,\n\u2206p dn \u2265 0.\nMoreover, since dn and un share the same boundary values on both boundaries of the set Sn , we can use Hopf's lemma on the smooth curve {un = ln },\nthus obtaining that\n\u03c9 = |\u2207dn | \u2265 |\u2207un |,\n\n\u2200 x \u2208 {un = ln }.\n\nDefine now the set An := {ln \u2264 un \u2264 1}. From Hopf's lemma we can\ndeduce that the function fn := dn \u2212 un is strictly positive in a annulus Mn\n(a neighborhood of {un = ln }) inside An . Suppose, by contradiction, that\nMn is strictly contained in the neighborhood An ; consider fn in the domain\nM\u0303n := Sn \u222a Mn : it holds that fn = 0 on \u2202Kn , fn > 0 in {0 < un < ln },\nfn = 0 on {un = ln }, fn > 0 in Mn and fn = 0 on \u2202Mn . But this is\na contradiction since fn is super-harmonic and should reach its maximum\nvalue at the boundary of M\u0303n . Hence Mn = An . Then in the set An one has\nthat un \u2264 dn . As a consequence, for m \u2264 n, i.e., lm \u2265 ln , and x \u2208 \u2202Kn =\n{un = 0},\ndist(x, {un = lm }) \u2265 dist(x, {dn = lm }) = \u03bbm ,\nand un \u2208 Bm as claimed. In particular, since um is constructed as the\nextremal supersolution in the set Bm , we have that um \u2264 un , which in particular implies that Kn \u2282 Km . This is, Kn \u2192 K is a decreasing sequence of\nsets, and the claim is proved.\nClaim 4: Let K := \u2229n Kn . Then K \u2287 D and is convex. In particular,\nit is not degenerate.\nFollowing the steps of Lemma 4.13, one can show that the solution (v, D)\nof problem (PBI ) is a supersolution to the (\u03bbn , ln ) distance problem. Hence\nKn \u2287 D for any n \u2208 N.\nClaim 5 : There exists a function u such that un \u2192 u in the space\n1,\u03b1\nCloc\n(\u03a9\\K) \u2229 C \u03b1 (\u03a9\\K).\nClaim 6: In addition, u = 0 on \u2202K and \u2202K \u2208 C 0,\u03b1 , so that u is the\np-capacitary potential in the annulus \u03a9\\K.\nClaims 5 and 6 follow similarly as the exterior case as a consequence of\nuniform C \u03b1 estimates up to the boundary for a convex annulus \u03a9\\K, so we\n24\n\n\fwill not make further comment.\nNow we remark that the the regularity of the boundary \u2202K is slightly\nworse than in the exterior case (see Remark 4.9), indeed it is only C 0,1 , and\nwe may not have gradient bounds up to the boundary. However, we still\nhave from the proof of Claim 3 that in the set An := {ln \u2264 un < 1} it holds\nthat\n(4.11)\n\n|\u2207un | \u2264 \u03c9.\n\nNow we may pass to the limit n \u2192 \u221e. It is easy to see that |\u2207un | converges\nuniformly to |\u2207u| on compact sets inside \u03a9\\K. As a consequence of (4.11)\nwe get the following claim:\nClaim 7: |\u2207u| \u2264 \u03c9 on \u2202K. From Lemma 2.7 we also get that |\u2207u| \u2264 \u03c9\nin \u03a9\\K.\nTo complete the proof of Theorem 4.12 it suffices to show that D = K\nand u = v. First, in Claim 4 we have shown that D \u2282 K. On the other\nhand, in Claim 7 we have shown that |\u2207u| \u2264 \u03c9 on \u2202K. This in particular\nimplies that (u, K) is a supersolution for the Bernoulli problem (PBI ) in the\nsense of Remark 4.11. As a consequence, one gets that K \u2282 D (see [36]), as\ndesired.\nRemark 4.14. If \u03a9 is a ball, relation (4.8) can be written explicitly. Indeed\nfor \u03bbmax in Lemma 4.2 via the limit\n\uf8f1\ne/R if N = p,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nl\nN\u22121\n\u0012\n\u0013\n=\nlim\n1 p \u2212 1 p\u2212N\n\uf8f4\nl\u21920 \u03bbmax\n\uf8f3\nif N 6= p,\nR N \u22121\none recovers the usual Bernoulli constant for the ball calculated in [36].\n\n5\n\nThe star-shaped case\n\nA domain U \u2282 RN is called star-shaped with respect to the point x0 \u2208 U if\nfor all x \u2208 U the segment joining x and x0 is contained in U . Moreover the\nset U is called star-shaped with respect to the ball B \u2282 U if U is star-shaped\nwith respect to every point x0 \u2208 B.\n\n25\n\n\fLet U be a star-shaped domain with respect to the point x0 . For \u03b8 \u2208\nSN \u22121 , where SN \u22121 is the unit sphere, set\n\u03c6(\u03b8) = sup{\u03c1 > 0 : x0 + \u03c1\u03b8 \u2208 U }.\nThen we can write\nU = {x0 = \u03c1\u03b8 : \u03b8 \u2208 SN \u22121 , 0 \u2264 \u03c1 < \u03c6(\u03b8)}.\nIt is well known [17] that:\nLemma 5.1. Let U be a bounded domain in RN which is star-shaped with\nrespect to the point x0 \u2208 U . Then it is star-shaped with respect to a ball\ncentered at x0 if and only if the function \u03c6 satisfies the Lipschitz condition\non SN \u22121 .\nWe call such domains star-shaped Lipschitz. It is clear that star-shaped\nLipschitz sets satisfy both the interior and exterior cone condition. One may\nalso consider star-shaped Lipschitz rings: they are of the form U = \u03a9\\K,\nwhere \u03a9 and K are star-shaped Lipschitz with respect to the same center.\nGiven a bounded, star-shaped Lipschitz domain K \u2282 RN , we consider\nthe exterior distance problem\n(\n\u2206p u = 0 in \u03a9 \\ K, u = 1 in K, u = 0 on \u2202\u03a9,\n(P\u2217 )\ndist(x, \u0393l ) = \u03bb for all x \u2208 \u2202\u03a9,\nfor some function u and a star-shaped domain \u03a9 \u2282 RN , with the same center\nas K. Our main result in this section is stated in the following theorem:\nTheorem 5.2. Problem (P\u2217 ) has a unique solution (u, \u03a9) with \u2202\u03a9 \u2208 C 0,\u03b1\nand C 1,1 from inside.\nBefore we give the proof of the theorem, let us briefly recall what is known\nfor the (exterior) classical Bernoulli problem (PB ) when K star-shaped with\nrespect to a ball. For the case p = 2 Kawohl proved in [41] existence and\nuniqueness of a (variational) solution via rearrangement method. In addition\nhe proved that such solution has star-shaped Lipschitz level sets. Also AckerMeyer [7] showed that, still for p = 2, the solution is regular and that\n\u2202\u03a9 \u2208 C \u221e is also starlike with respect to the same ball.\nNow we are ready for the proof of Theorem 5.2: it follows the lines of\nthe problem in the convex case, but some additional ingredients are needed\nto compensate for the lack of convexity. First, note that uniqueness was\nalready shown in Lemma 3.7.\n26\n\n\fNote that the regularity results of Theorem 2.1 and Lemma 2.2 still hold\nsince they only depend on the Lipschitz constant of the boundary of the\ndomain. Moreover, Lemma 2.6 is true for star-shaped rings as it was shown\nin [47]: indeed, a solution of the p-Laplacian equation is smooth, C 1,\u03b1 , and\nsatisfies a type of Harnack inequality, from which a bound from below for\nthe gradient follows. Moreover, we have the following proposition:\nProposition 5.3 ([41]). Let l \u2208 [0, 1). Given a (Lipschitz) star-shaped\nring \u03a9\\K and its p-capacitary function u\u03a9 described as above, the level sets\n{u\u03a9 > l} are (Lipschitz) star-shaped.\nSince, by hypothesis, the initial domain K is star-shaped Lipschitz with\nrespect to some point, then there exists some small ball B\u03b4 centered at that\npoint such that K is star-shaped with respect to that ball. Consider the\nclass\nC\u2217 := {\u03a9 open, bounded, star-shaped with respect to B\u03b4 , \u03a9 \u2283 K},\nand define the set of sub- and super-solutions as follows:\nA\n\n= {\u03a9 \u2208 C\u2217 | sup dist(x, \u0393l ) \u2264 \u03bb},\nx\u2208\u2202\u03a9\n\nA0 = {\u03a9 \u2208 C\u2217 | inf dist(x, \u0393l ) < \u03bb},\nx\u2208\u2202\u03a9\n\nB\n\n= {\u03a9 \u2208 C\u2217 | inf dist(x, \u0393l ) \u2265 \u03bb}.\nx\u2208\u2202\u03a9\n\nThe construction of super- and sub-solutions in Lemma 3.2 is valid also\nfor K star-shaped Lipschitz domains; this implies that the sets A0 and B are\nnonempty. Lemma 3.4 holds as well. Consider now a set \u03a90 \u2208 A0 and set\n\u03a9 \u2282 RN to be the intersection of all domains in the class B containing \u03a90 .\nBy construction, \u03a9 is star-shaped with respect to the same ball B\u03b4 . Let u to\nbe the p-capacitary potential of \u03a9\\K. Then one may conclude as in Lemma\n3.5 that \u03a9 \u2208 B; the only tricky point is to check that there exists a uniform\nH\u00f6lder estimate in equation (3.3). But this is true because C \u03b1 -estimates up\nto the boundary from Corollary 2.4 only depend on the Lipschitz constant\nof the boundary. Moreover, we know by construction that\ninf dist(x, \u0393l ) \u2265 \u03bb.\n\nx\u2208\u2202\u03a9\n\nThis implies that the equivalent of Lemma 3.5 and Corollary 3.6 for starshaped domains are proven.\nFinally, one needs to check that the function u is indeed a solution for\nthe distance problem (P\u2217 ), i.e.\n(5.1)\n\ndist(x, \u0393l ) = \u03bb\n\nfor all x \u2208 \u2202\u03a9.\n27\n\n\fThis follows from a simple argument: let \u03a9 be the extremal set as constructed above, and set L := {u > l}. Note that L is a star-shaped\nannulus. By contradiction, assume that there exists x0 \u2208 \u2202\u03a9 such that\ndist(x0 , \u2202L) > \u03bb. Define \u03a9\u0303 as\n\u03a9\u0303 := {x \u2208 \u03a9 : dist(x, L) < \u03bb},\nand let \u0169 be the p-capacitary potential of \u03a9\u0303\\K. By hypothesis, \u03a9\u0303 $ \u03a9.\nComparison principle implies that \u0169 \u2264 u and consequently\ndist(x, {\u0169 = l}) \u2265 dist(x, {u = l}) \u2265 \u03bb,\n\nfor x \u2208 \u2202 \u03a9\u0303.\n\nSince \u2202 \u03a9\u0303 has a fixed distance \u03bb from \u0393l , and \u0393l is a star-shaped surface,\nwe conjecture that \u03a9\u0303 is also star-shaped with respect to the ball B\u03b4 . We\nproceed by contradiction: suppose that \u03a9\u0303 is not star-shaped with respect\nto a point in B\u03b4 . Without loss of generality we can assume this point to be\nthe origin x = 0. Note that both sets L := {l \u2264 u \u2264 1} and \u03a9\u0303 are smooth.\nThen there exists a point z \u2208 \u2202 \u03a9\u0303 such that the tangent plane \u03a0 to \u2202 \u03a9\u0303 at z\npasses through the origin.\nBy construction the point z lies at a distance \u03bb from \u0393l ; in particular\nthere exists x0 \u2208 \u0393l where this distance is attained. Since all the sets here\nare smooth, we know that the line joining x0 to z is normal to the plane\n\u03a0. Then one may just work with the intersection of \u03a9\u0303 with the plane \u03a01 ,\nwhere \u03a01 is the plane that contains the origin, the point z and the normal\nvector ~\u03bd (see Figure 1).\nConsider now the line s passing through the points 0 and z and the line\nt passing through 0 and x0 . Since the set L is star-shaped with respect to 0,\nthe curve \u0393l \u2229 \u03a01 has to cross the line t exactly at x0 , and after crossing, it\nlies on the half-plane bounded by t that does not contain the point z. Hence\nthere exist some points in \u03a9\u0303 \u2229 \u03a01 which are on the half-plane bounded by\ns (which does not contain x0 ) that lie at a distance strictly greater than \u03bb\nfrom \u0393l . But this contradicts the definition of \u03a9\u0303.\nHence \u03a9\u0303 is star-shaped and belongs to B; by the minimality of \u03a9 if\nfollows that \u03a9\u0303 = \u03a9 and (5.1) is proven.\nFor the regularity, just note that the distance property implies that \u2202\u03a9\n1,1\nis C from inside, but further regularity is unknown. The proof of Theorem\n5.2 is thus completed.\n\n28\n\n\f\u0393l \u2229 \u03a01\nx0\n\u2022\n\nt\n\ns\n\n!\u03bd\n\n\u2022\nz\n\n0\u2022\n\u03a9\u0303\nFigure 1: Star-shaped domain\n\n6\n6.1\n\nGeneralizations\nNon-constant distance property - convex case\n\nThe next question one may ask is what happens when we replace the constant \u03bb in the distance property by a non-constant function \u03bb(x). For the\nBernoulli problem, this problem was considered in [35]. We concentrate on\nthe exterior problem here; the interior problem follows the same line with\nappropriate modifications.\nTheorem 6.1. Let K \u2282 RN , N \u2265 2, be a convex open bounded domain,\nl \u2208 (0, 1) and \u03bb(x) a continuous function satisfying 0 < c0 \u2264 \u03bb(x) \u2264 c1 in\nRN . Suppose moreover that \u03bb(x) is locally concave in RN \\K (i.e., concave\non each line segment contained in the set RN \\K).\nThen there exist a function u \u2208 C 1,\u03b1 (\u03a9) and a convex open bounded\ndomain \u03a9 \u2282 RN , \u03a9 \u2283 K, \u2202\u03a9 \u2208 C 2 which solve the following problem:\n(\n\u2206p u = 0 in \u03a9 \\ K, u = 1 in K, u = 0 on \u2202\u03a9,\n\u2032\n(PE )\ndist(x, \u0393l ) = \u03bb(x) for all x \u2208 \u2202\u03a9.\nMoreover if the function\n(6.1)\n\nt \u2208 [0, 1] 7\u2192 t\u03bb((x \u2212 z0 )/t)\n\nis strictly increasing for all x \u2208 RN for some z0 \u2208 K, then \u03a9 is unique.\nProof. The proof of the above theorem is analogous to one of Theorem 3.1,\nwith small modifications that we indicate below. First, the sets A, B and\n29\n\n\fA0 are defined as in Section 3. Super and subsolutions are constructed as\nin Lemma 3.2 by choosing, for the supersolution, R big enough such that\ndist(x, {uR = l}) \u2265 c1\nand, for the subsolution, \u03b5 small enough such that\n\u03b5l\n\u2264 c0 .\n\u03b1\nNext, Lemma 3.4 and 3.5 follow similarly. The existence of a neighborhood\nof radius \u03b5 contained in each \u03a9k for all k where one can apply Harnack\ninequality is a consequence of the fact that \u03bb(x) is a continuous function.\nCorollary 3.6 holds as well for \u03bb = \u03bb(x) and the proof follows exactly\nthe one for \u03bb = const. Hence we obtain (\u03a9, u) minimal in the class B. \u03a9 is\nconvex by construction, and thus, \u2202\u03a9 is Lipschitz.\nIt remains to check that this solution satisfies the distance property, i.e.,\ndist(x, {u = l}) = \u03bb(x)\n\nfor all x \u2208 \u2202\u03a9.\n\nContrary to the constant case, convexity for \u03a9 is a crucial hypothesis. By\ncontradiction, assume that the above is not true, i.e. there exists a point\nx0 \u2208 \u2202\u03a9 such that\ndist(x0 , {u = l}) > \u03bb(x0 ).\nBy continuity one can find a neighborhood V \u220b x0 such that dist(x, {u =\nl}) > \u03bb(x) for all x \u2208 V . Let E\u03a9 be the set of extremal points of \u03a9. If\nx0 \u2208 E\u03a9 , then one may find a convex set \u03a9\u0303 such that \u03a9\\V\n\u03a9\u0303\n\u03a9 and\nx0 6\u2208 \u03a9\u0303. Let \u0169 be the p-capacitary function of \u03a9\u0303. Comparison principle\nimplies that \u0169 \u2264 u; then for all x \u2208 \u2202 \u03a9\u0303,\ndist(x, {\u0169 = l}) \u2265 dist(x, {u = l}) \u2265 \u03bb(x).\nWe have just shown that \u03a9\u0303 \u2208 B. Contradiction with the minimality of \u03a9.\nIf x0 6\u2208 E\u03a9 , then x0 can be written as a linear combination of extremal\npoints, i.e.,\n(6.2)\n\nx0 =\n\nn\nX\n\nt n xn ,\n\nwhere\n\nn\nX\n\nti = 1, xi \u2208 E\u03a9 , i = 1, . . . , n.\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nBy hypothesis dist(xi , {u = l}) = \u03bb(xi ) for every i = 1, . . . , n and\ndist(x0 , {u = l}) \u2264\n\nn\nX\n\nti dist(xi , {u = l}) =\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\n30\n\nti \u03bb(xi ) \u2264 \u03bb(x0 ),\n\n\fwhere we have used the local concavity assumption on \u03bb for the last inequality.\nNext, to show that that the solution is unique we follow the same rescaling method as in Lemma 3.7. Suppose, by contradiction, that (PE\u2032 ) has\ntwo solutions (u1 , \u03a91 ), (u2 , \u03a92 ). Without loss of generality assume that in\nhypothesis (6.1) we have that z0 = 0 \u2208 K. Rescale u\u03b52 (x) = u2 (x/\u03b5). Then\n\u03a9\u03b52 \u2282 \u03a91 and one may consider the biggest \u03b5(< 1) such that \u03a9\u03b52 touches \u03a91\nfrom inside. Let x\u03b50 \u2208 \u2202\u03a9\u03b52 \u2229 \u03a91 and x0 = x\u03b50 /\u03b5. It holds\n(6.3)\ndist(x\u03b50 , {u\u03b52 = l}) = \u03b5dist(x0 , {u2 = l}) = \u03b5\u03bb(x0 ) = \u03b5\u03bb(x\u03b50 /\u03b5) < \u03bb(x\u03b50 ),\nthanks to (6.1) for the last inequality. On the other hand, by comparison\nprinciple, we easily have that u\u03b52 \u2264 u1 ; in particular,\n(6.4)\n\ndist(x\u03b50 , {u\u03b52 = l}) \u2265 dist(x\u03b50 , {u1 = l}) = \u03bb(x\u03b50 ).\n\nThen equations (6.3) and (6.4) give the desired contradiction.\nWe look now at the regularity: since \u03a9 is convex the surface {u = l} is\nanalytic by Lemma 2.8. Then \u2202\u03a9 is the set of points at distance \u03bb(x) from\nthis level set, that will have principal curvatures given by the formula\n\u03bci\n.\n1 + \u03bb(x)\u03bci\nIf \u03bb is continuous, then \u2202\u03a9 will have continuous principal curvatures, which\nimplies that \u2202\u03a9 \u2208 C 2 . Higher regularity on \u03bb will imply higher regularity\nfor \u2202\u03a9. The proof of the theorem is thus completed.\n\n6.2\n\nThe distance problem with mean curvature condition\n\nWe shall now consider the case where \u03bb = \u03bb(x, \u03ba(x)), with \u03ba(x) being the\nmean curvature of \u2202\u03a9 at the point x. The standard Bernoulli problem\nfor harmonic functions (case p = 2) with non-constant gradient condition\ndepending on the mean curvature has been studied in [10, 53, 54] through\na variational formulation for the functional\nZ\n|\u2207u|2 dx + Per({v > 0}).\nD\n\nHere we follow the sub/supersolution approach.\nWe first recall the definition of mean curvature in the viscosity sense:\n31\n\n\fDefinition 6.2. For U a bounded convex domain, one may define the (interior) mean curvature of \u2202U in the viscosity sense as follows: assume that\n0 \u2208 \u2202U and that the interior normal \u03bd to \u2202\u03a9 at the origin is in the direction\nof the e-axis. We define\n\u03ba(\u2202U )(0) := inf \u03ba(SA )(0),\nA\u2208U\n\nwhere SA = {(x, e) : e = hAx, xi} and U is the set of all symmetric matrices\nA such that the set SA (the graph of a quadratic polynomial) locally touches\n\u2202U at 0 from inside.\nIf the set U is empty (i.e., no paraboloid touches \u2202U at 0 from inside),\nwe define\n\u03ba(\u2202U )(0) = \u221e.\nWe also define the exterior mean curvature\nDefinition 6.3. Let U be as in the previous definition: We define the exterior mean curvature \u03ba(\u2202U )(0) as\n\u03ba(\u2202U )(0) := sup \u03ba(SA )(0),\nA\u2208U\n\nwhere SA = {(x, e) : e = hAx, xi} and U is the set of all symmetric matrices\nA such that the set SA (the graph of a quadratic polynomial) locally touches\n\u2202U at 0 from outside.\nIf the graph of any quadratic polynomial locally touches \u2202U at x = 0\nfrom outside, we say that\n\u03ba(\u2202U )(0) = \u221e.\nClearly for any point x0 \u2208 \u2202U where \u2202U \u2208 C 2 in a neighborhood of x0\nit holds that \u03ba(\u2202U )(x0 ) = \u03ba(\u2202U )(x0 ).\nIn this section we study the exterior discrete Bernoulli problem (PE\u2032 ) with\ndistance condition depending on the mean curvature. More precisely, given\na convex bounded domain K with \u2202K \u2208 C 1,1 we prescribe the condition\n(6.5)\n\ndist(x, \u0393l ) =\n\n \u0303l\n=: \u03bb\u03ba,l\u0303 (x),\n\u03ba(\u2202\u03a9)(x)\n\nx \u2208 \u2202\u03a9,\n\nwith  \u0303l \u2208 (0, 1). We do not include  \u0303l = 1 since it is not an admissible value\nfor the case when K is a ball, as explained in Lemma 6.7.\nThe main result is summarized in the following theorem.\n32\n\n\fTheorem 6.4. Let K \u2282 RN , N \u2265 2, be a convex open bounded set and\nl,  \u0303l \u2208 (0, 1). There exist a function u \u2208 C 1,\u03b1 (\u03a9) and a convex open bounded\ndomain \u03a9 \u2282 RN , \u03a9 \u2283 K, with \u2202\u03a9 \u2208 C 0,1 which solve the following problem:\n\n\u2032 )\n(PK\n\n\uf8f1\n\u2206 u = 0 in \u03a9 \\ K, u = 1 in K, u = 0 on \u2202\u03a9,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 p\ndist(x, \u0393l ) \u2265 \u03bb\u03ba,l\u0303 (x) for all x \u2208 \u2202\u03a9,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\ndist(x, \u0393l ) = \u03bb\u03ba,l\u0303 (x) for all x \u2208 \u2202\u03a9\u03ba ,\n\nwhere \u03bb\u03ba,l\u0303 (x) is defined in (6.5) and \u2202\u03a9\u03ba is the set of all points x \u2208 \u2202\u03a9 for\nwhich at least one of the following assumptions is satisfied:\n(A1) x is an extremal point of \u03a9 and \u2202\u03a9 is C 2 -smooth at x,\n(A2) x is not an extremal point, but it can be written as a linear combination\nof extremal points satisfying (A1).\nMoreover the set \u2202\u03a9 \u2208 C 0,1 does not contain points x of the form\n(A3) x is an extremal point of \u03a9 and \u03ba(\u2202\u03a9)(x) = \u03ba(\u2202\u03a9)(x) = \u221e,\n(A4) x is not an extremal point, but it can be written as a linear combination\nof extremal points satisfying (A3).\nRecall that extremal points are defined in Definition 2.10. We first show\na technical lemma that will be used later:\nLemma 6.5. Let \u03a9n be a decreasing sequence of convex bounded domains\nconverging in Hausdorff measure to \u03a9. Let x0 be a point on \u2202\u03a9; it holds\n(6.6)\n\nlim inf \u03ba(\u2202\u03a9n )(xn ) \u2264 \u03ba(\u2202\u03a9)(x0 ),\n{xn }\n\nwhere the lim inf is taken for all sequences {xn } satisfying xn \u2208 \u2202\u03a9n and\nxn \u2192 x0 .\nProof. First note that if \u03ba(\u2202\u03a9)(x0 ) = +\u221e inequality (6.6) holds. Let x0 be\na regular point with curvature 0 \u2264 k0 := \u03ba(\u2202\u03a9)(x0 ) < +\u221e. Without loss\nof generality assume that x0 = 0. For any \u03b5 > 0, there exists a paraboloid\nPk0 +\u03b5 with curvature \u03ba0 + \u03b5 at the point x = 0 that touches \u2202\u03a9 from inside\nat 0 in a neighborhood U\u03b5 \u220b 0 (see Figure 2).\nShift now the paraboloid Pk0 +\u03b5 by a small positive distance \u03b4 in the\ndirection of the outward normal ~\u03bd to \u2202\u03a9 at 0; denote this shifted ball by\nPk\u03b40 +\u03b5 . Clearly, if \u03b4 is small enough, Pk\u03b40 +\u03b5 \u2229 \u2202\u03a9 \u2282 U\u03b5 . Since \u03a9n are convex\n33\n\n\fP\u03ba\u03b40 +\u03b5\n\n!\u03bd\n\n\u20220\n\nU\u03b5\n\nP\u03ba0 +\u03b5\n\u2202\u03a9\n\nFigure 2:\nsets and {\u2202\u03a9n } converges to \u2202\u03a9 as n \u0580 \u221e, there exists at least a set\n\u03a9n\u03b4 , with n\u03b4 dependent on \u03b4, such that \u03a9 \u222a (Pk\u03b40 +\u03b5 \u2229 U\u03b5 ) \u2286 \u03a9n\u03b4 and \u2202\u03a9n\u03b4 \u2229\n\u2202Pk\u03b40 +\u03b5 = {xn\u03b4 }; moreover Pk\u03b40 +\u03b5 touches tangentially \u2202\u03a9n\u03b4 at the point xn\u03b4 .\nInequality (6.6) follows since \u03b5 and \u03b4 can be taken arbitrarily small.\nThe supersolutions are given by those \u03a9 such that\n(6.7)\n\ndist(x, \u0393l )\u2265 \u03bb\u03ba,l\u0303 (x),\n\nand hence we define the set of all supersolutions as\nB := {\u03a9 \u2282 RN , convex, bounded, K \u22d0 \u03a9 : u\u03a9 satisfies (6.7)}.\nNote that if x0 \u2208 \u2202\u03a9 is a point where \u03ba(\u2202\u03a9)(x) = +\u221e then the distance\nproperty (6.7) does not impose any restriction. One may define analogously\nA (and A0 ) to be the set of subsolutions (strict subsolutions) through condition\n(6.8)\n\ndist(x, \u0393l )\u2264(<) \u03bb\u03ba,l\u0303 (x).\n\nLemma 6.6. If \u03a91 , \u03a92 \u2208 B, then \u03a91 \u2229 \u03a92 \u2208 B.\nProof. The proof is a simple consequence of the fact that\ndist(x0 , {u\u03a91 \u2229\u03a92 = l}) \u2265 max {dist(x, {u\u03a91 = l}), dist(x0 , {u\u03a92 = l})} .\n\n34\n\n\fLemma 6.7. The sets B and A are non empty. Moreover, any supersolution\nis greater or equal than every admissible subsolution.\nProof. A possible supersolution for our problem is the function uR constructed in Lemma 3.2: this depends on the fact that there exists R big\nenough such that\ndist(x, \u0393l ) \u2265  \u0303l R\n\n\u2200x \u2208 \u2202BR (0)\n\nand  \u0303l \u2208 (0, 1).\n\nNote that if K is the ball Br (0) and \u016b(|x|) the capacitary function in the\nannulus BR (0) \\ Br (0), condition (3.1) becomes\n\u0012\n\u0010 r \u0011l \u0013\n1\u2212\n\u2265  \u0303l.\nR\nClearly there exists some finite value for R (dependent on  \u0303l) that satisfies\nthe inequality above if  \u0303l \u2208 (0, 1) but none if  \u0303l = 1.\nFor the subsolution consider the function u\u03b5 constructed in Lemma 3.2;\nit holds\n\u03b5 \u0303l\ndist(x, {u\u03b5 = l}) \u2264 , for all x \u2208 {u\u03b5 = 0},\n\u03b1\nand the desired property (6.8) is satisfied by choosing\n\u03b5\u2264\n\n\u03b1\nmaxx\u2208{uR =1\u2212\u03b5} \u03ba(x)\n\n,\n\nwhere \u03ba(x) is the mean curvature of the level set {uR = 1 \u2212 \u03b5}. Note that\nmaxx\u2208{uR =1\u2212\u03b5} \u03ba(x) < +\u221e since this level set is a analytic surface (see\nProposition 2.8).\nLastly we show that any supersolution is larger than every subsolution.\nWe proceed as in Lemma 3.3 by assuming that there exists a subsolution,\ndenoted by (\u03a9S , uS ) which is not everywhere larger than a subsolution,\ndenoted by (\u03a9s , us ). We rescale the subsolution until \u2202\u03a9\u03b5s touches \u2202\u03a9S at a\npoint x0 \u2208 \u2202\u03a9\u03b5s \u2229 \u2202\u03a9S . Then\n\u03ba(\u2202\u03a9\u03b5s )(x0 ) \u2265 \u03ba(\u2202\u03a9S )(x0 ).\nUsing strong comparison principle we arrive at the following contradiction:\n \u0303l\n \u0303l\n\u03b5\n\u2265\ndist(x\n,\n{u\n=\nl})\n>\ndist(x\n,\n{u\n=\nl})\n\u2265\n.\n0\n0\nS\ns\n\u03ba(\u2202\u03a9\u03b5s )(x0 )\n\u03ba(\u2202\u03a9S )(x0 )\nThis concludes the proof of the lemma.\n35\n\n\fLemma 6.8. Let {\u03a9n } be a decreasing sequence of bounded convex domains\nin B, and define \u03a9 := Interior(\u2229\u03a9k ). Then the p-capacitary potential of\n\u03a9\\K, denoted by u\u03a9 , satisfies (6.7) and thus, \u03a9 \u2208 B. Moreover, there exists\na positive constant c0 such that \u03ba(\u2202\u03a9)(x) \u2265 c0 for all x \u2208 \u2202\u03a9.\nProof. Since each domains \u03a9n is convex, we can start as in the proof of\nLemma 3.5. Let un be the p-capacitary potential of \u03a9n \\K. The sequence\n{un } converges in C 1,\u03b1 norm to a p-harmonic function u. Convexity immediately implies that u \u2261 0 outside \u03a9, as it was done in (3.3). In addition\nit holds that the set {un = l} converges to the set {u = l} and that \u2202\u03a9n\nconverges to \u2202\u03a9 in Hausdorff distance.\nWe show first that K \u22d0 \u03a9: the existence of a subsolution (found in\nLemma 6.7) implies, using Lemma 2.5, that |\u2207un | \u2264 M for a constant M\nindependent of n. Consequently, for any n \u2208 N, it holds\n(6.9)\n\ndist(x, {un = l}) \u2265\n\nl\n,\nM\n\n\u2200x \u2208 \u2202\u03a9n .\n\nThis implies that K \u22d0 \u03a9. Unfortunately inequality (6.9) does not give any\ninformation on uniform bounds from above for \u03ba(\u2202\u03a9n ).\nInstead we show that \u03ba(\u2202\u03a9) is uniformly bounded from below by a positive constant. By construction we have that \u03a9n \u2282 \u03a90 for every n. Then,\nfor every point xn \u2208 \u2202\u03a9n ,\n(6.10)\n\n \u0303l\n\u2264 dist(xn , {un = l}) \u2264 diam(\u03a90 ),\n\u03ba(\u2202\u03a9n )(xn )\n\n\u2200xn \u2208 \u2202\u03a9n .\n\nIn particular \u2202\u03a9n cannot have flat parts. Moreover, if we take a sequence\nxn \u2208 \u2202\u03a9n such that xn \u2192 x0 as n \u0580 \u221e with x0 \u2208 \u2202\u03a9, from (6.10) and (6.6)\n(maybe after passing to a subsequence) we get\n \u0303\nl\n\u2264 diam(\u03a90 ),\n\u03ba(\u2202\u03a9)(x0 )\n\n\u2200x0 \u2208 \u2202\u03a9,\n\nwhich shows that \u2202\u03a9 cannot have flat parts either.\nTwo things are now to be proven: (i) the function u is the p-capacitary\npotential in \u03a9\\K and (ii) the function u satisfies (6.7). Suppose that \u03a9\u0303 :=\n{supp(u)} \u2282 \u03a9; then there exists a point x0 \u2208 \u2202 \u03a9\u0303\\\u2202\u03a9 with a neighborhood\nof radius \u03b5, denoted by B\u03b5 (x0 ), such that \u03a9\u0303 \u222a B\u03b5 (x0 ) \u2282 \u03a9. Let P \u2208 {u = l}\nbe the closest point of {u = l} to x0 and cover the segment x0 , P with a\nfinite number of balls if radius \u03b5. Note that this is possible because the\nsegment x0 , P has a non-negative finite length whose bounds are given in\n36\n\n\f(6.9) and (6.10). By mimicking the argument in Lemma 3.5 one can show\nthat Harnack inequality leads to a contradiction. Hence (i) is proven.\nConsider now a point x0 \u2208 \u2202\u03a9 and any sequence {xn \u2208 \u2202\u03a9n } such that\nxn \u2192 x0 as n \u0580 \u221e; it holds\ndist(xn , {un = l}) \u2192 dist(x0 , {u = l}),\n\nas n \u0580 \u221e.\n\nOn the other hand, taking lim supn\u2192+\u221e on both sides of (6.7) and using\n(6.6) we obtain\nlim dist(xn , {un = l}) \u2265 lim sup\n\nn\u2192+\u221e\n\nn\u2192+\u221e\n\n \u0303l\n \u0303l\n\u2265\n.\n\u03ba(\u2202\u03a9n )(xn )\n\u03ba(\u2202\u03a9)(x0 )\n\nThe proof is completed.\nProof of Theorem 6.4. It remains to prove that the p-capacitary\nfunction (u\u03a9 , \u03a9) constructed in Lemma 6.8 satisfies the distance property\n(6.11)\n\ndist(x, \u0393l ) = \u03bb\u03ba,l\u0303 (x),\n\nfor every x that satisfies either (A1) and (A2) and that \u2202\u03a9 does not have\npoints that satisfy (A3) nor (A4).\nSuppose, by contradiction, that there exists an extremal point x0 \u2208 \u2202\u03a9\nsuch that\n \u0303l\ndist(x0 , {u\u03a9 = l}) \u2265\n+ \u03b4, \u03b4 > 0.\n\u03ba(\u2202\u03a9)(x0 )\nThen there exists a neighborhood U of x0 (depending on \u03b4) such that for\nany x \u2208 U \u2229 \u2202\u03a9 it holds\n(6.12)\n\ndist(x, {u\u03a9 = l}) \u2265\n\n \u0303l\n\u03b4\n+ .\n\u03ba(\u2202\u03a9)(x0 ) 2\n\nWe first assume that \u2202\u03a9 is C 2 in a neighborhood of x0 , i.e. assumption\n(A1) is satisfied. We apply translations and rotations so that x0 = 0 and\nchoose coordinates x = (x\u2032 , xn ) in such a way that \u03a9 \u2282 {xn > 0} and\nparameterize the surface \u2202\u03a9 near x0 as a graph xn = \u03c6(x\u2032 ), x\u2032 \u2208 RN \u22121 , such\nthat \u03c6(0) = 0, \u2207\u03c6(0) = 0. Defined a new function \u03c61 (x\u2032 ) := (1\u2212\u03b5)\u03c6(x\u2032 )+\u03b52 .\nFor \u03b5 small enough the intersection set V\u03b5 := {(x\u2032 , xn ), | \u03c6(x\u2032 ) = \u03c61 (x\u2032 )} is\nstrictly contained in the small neighborhood U . Consider the new function\n\u03c6\u0303 := max{\u03c6, \u03c61 } and define the set\n\u03a9\u0303 = (\u03a9 \u2229 U \u2229 {(x\u2032 , xn ) | xn > \u03c6\u0303(x\u2032 )}) \u222a (\u03a9 \u2229 U c ).\n37\n\n\fBy construction it holds that \u03a9\u0303\n\u03a9; moreover the mean curvature of \u03a9\u0303\ncan be estimated in terms of the mean curvature or \u2202\u03a9 at x0 , except maybe\nat the points in V\u03b5 \u2229 \u2202\u03a9, in which it may be infinity. Hence let \u0169 be the\np-capacitary potential of \u03a9\u0303\\K. Comparison principle and (6.12) yield, for \u03b5\nsmall enough,\ndist(x1 , {\u0169 = l}) \u2265 dist(x1 , {u\u03a9 = l}) \u2265\n\n \u0303l\n \u0303l\n\u03b4\n+ \u2265\n,\n\u03ba(\u2202\u03a9)(x0 ) 2\n\u03ba(\u2202\u03a9)(x1 )\n\nfor x1 \u2208 \u2202 \u03a9\u0303 \u2229 U . Note that we may obtain the same conclusion of x1 \u2208 V\u03b5\neven if the curvature at those points is ninfinity. The existence of such\n\u03a9\u0303 \u03a9 contradicts the minimality of \u03a9.\nLet us assume now that the extremal point x0 satisfies (A3). Inequality\n(6.12) reduces to\n\u03b4\ndist(x, {u\u03a9 = l}) \u2265 .\n2\nWe perturb \u03a9 to \u03a9\u0303 in the following way: consider, as before, \u2202\u03a9 written\nas the graph xn = \u03c6(x\u2032 ). By hypothesis, \u03ba(\u2202\u03a9)(x0 ) = \u221e, so for each\nconstant M > 0, there exists a paraboloid m(x\u2032 ) with curvature equal M\nat x0 that touches \u2202\u03a9 from outside at x0 . Define a new function \u03c61 (x\u2032 ) :=\n(1 \u2212 \u03b5)m(x\u2032 ) + \u03b52 and consider \u03c6\u0303 := max{\u03c6, \u03c61 }. Define the set \u03a9\u0303 as in\nthe previous case; contradiction follows similarly. Hence in such point x0 we\nhave that dist(x0 , {u\u03a9 = l}) = 0; but this is not possible because we have\nuniform gradient bounds for u\u03a9 (see Corollary 2.5).\nNext we consider the case of x0 not being an extremal point of \u2202\u03a9:\n1\nis a locally concave function if \u03a9 is\nLemma 12 in [54] shows that \u03ba(\u2202\u03a9)(x)\nconvex. Then we may proceed as in (6.2) and following arguments in order\nto conclude that property (6.11) is satisfied for each points of the form (A2)\nand that \u2202\u03a9 does not contain points of the form (A4).\nRemark 6.9.

The multi-phase version of Theorem 6.10 holds.\nThe proof of Theorem 6.10 already contains the fundamental ideas for\nm > 2: indeed Theorem 6.11 follows easily from Theorem 6.10 and the\nuniform separation results of Theorem 6.15.\nConsider the class of convex sets\n\b\nC := \u03a9 \u2282 RN , convex bounded domain : K1 \u22d0 \u03a9 \u22d0 K3 ,\n\nand u1 , u2 the p-capacitary potentials of K\\K1 and K3 \\K, respectively.\nDefine the set of subsolutions and supersolutions as\nA := {\u03a9 \u2208 C | dist(x, {u1 = l}) \u2264 g (x, {u2 = \u2212l})} ,\n(6.16)\n\nB := {\u03a9 \u2208 C | dist(x, {u1 = l}) \u2265 g (x, {u2 = \u2212l})} ,\n40\n\n\ffor x \u2208 \u2202K2 .\nWe next show that the set B is closed and stable under intersections:\nLemma 6.12. If \u03a9, \u03a9\u0303 \u2208 B, then \u03a9 \u2229 \u03a9\u0303 \u2208 B.\nProof. Let u1 , u2 , \u01691 , \u01692 be the p-capacitary potentials of \u03a9\\K1 , K3 \\\u03a9, \u03a9\u0303\\K1\nand K3 \\\u03a9\u0303 respectively. By construction \u03a9 \u2229 \u03a9\u0303 is a convex domain. Next,\nlet v1 and v2 be the p-capacitary potentials of (\u03a9 \u2229 \u03a9\u0303)\\K1 and K3 \\(\u03a9 \u2229 \u03a9\u0303)\nrespectively. Let x \u2208 \u2202(\u03a9 \u2229 \u03a9\u0303); without loss of generality we assume that\nx \u2208 \u2202\u03a9.\nBy comparison principle, v1 \u2264 min{u1 , \u01691 }. It holds\n(6.17)\n\ndist(x, {v1 = l}) \u2265 dist(x, {u1 = l}) \u2265 g (x, dist(x, {u2 = \u2212l})) ,\n\nsince \u03a9 \u2208 B.\nOn the other hand, by comparison principle we have that v2 \u2265 max{u2 , \u01692 };\nthus\ndist(x, {v2 = \u2212l}) \u2264 dist(x, {u2 = \u2212l}).\nSince g is non-decreasing with respect to the second argument, it holds\n(6.18)\n\ng (x, dist(x, {v2 = \u2212l})) \u2264 g (x, dist(x, {u2 = \u2212l})) .\n\nFormula (6.17) together with (6.18) gives that\ndist(x, {v1 = l}) \u2265 g (x, dist(x, {v2 = \u2212l})) ,\nwhich implies that \u03a9 \u2229 \u03a9\u0303 \u2208 B. The proof of the lemma is completed.\nLemma 6.13. Let \u03a91 \u2283 \u03a92 \u2283 . . . be a decreasing sequence of convex domains in B. Then \u03a9 := Interior(\u2229\u03a9k ) \u03a9 belongs to the class B.\nProof. Let uk1 and uk2 be the p-capacitary potentials of \u03a9k \\K1 and K3 \\\u03a9k ,\nrespectively. By standard arguments one can show that uk1 and uk2 converge\nin C \u03b1 to v1 and v2 , the p-capacitary potentials of \u03a9\\K1 , K3 \\\u03a9. Moreover\nthe convergence is C 1,\u03b1 away from the boundary sets.\nTo conclude the proof of the lemma, we need to show that dist(x, {v1 =\nl}) \u2265 g (x, {v2 = \u2212l}) for x \u2208 \u2202\u03a9: the proof mimics the one of the one-phase\ncase (see Lemma 3.5.\nLemma 6.14. The classes A, B are nonempty.\n\n41\n\n\fProof. Consider the solution u of the p-capacitary problem in K3 \\K1 :\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u2206p u = 0 in K3 \\K1 ,\n(6.19)\nu = 1 on \u2202K1 ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nu = \u22121 on \u2202K3 .\nFor any \u03b5 \u2208 (\u22121, 1), set K\u03b5 := {u = \u03b5}, and define the function\n\uf8f1\nu(x) \u2212 \u03b1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nfor x \u2208 K\u03b5 \\K1\n\uf8f2 u1,\u03b5 (x) =\n1\u2212\u03b1\nu\u03b5 (x) :=\n\uf8f4\nu(x) \u2212 \u03b1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 u2,\u03b5 (x) =\nfor x \u2208 K3 \\K\u03b5 .\n1+\u03b1\n\nThen one may check, using assumption (H4) that K\u03b5 \u2208 B for \u03b5 close to \u22121,\nand that K\u03b5 \u2208 A for \u03b5 close to +1.\nProof of Theorem 6.10: Let K2 be the minimal set in B; K2 is convex\nand well defined by the previous lemmas. Let u1 , u2 be the p-capacitary\npotentials of K2 \\K1 and K3 \\K2 , respectively. Then we just need to check\nthe joining condition (6.15). Suppose by contradiction that the property\n(6.15) fails. Then there exists x0 \u2208 \u2202K2 such that\ndist(x0 , {u1 = l}) > g (x0 , dist(x, {u2 = \u2212l})) + \u03b5.\nBy continuity, the same inequality holds (maybe with \u03b5/2) in a whole neighborhood of x0 . If x0 is an extremal point of K2 the same argument as in\nSection 6.1 gives a contradiction.\nHowever, if x0 is not an extremal point but is a finite linear combination\nof extremal points, we need the following additional argument: for x \u2208 \u2202K2 ,\nx 7\u2192 dist(x, {u1 = l}) is a convex function and x 7\u2192 dist(x, {u2 = \u2212l}) is\nconcave. By the concavity assumption (H3) of g, we know that the function\nG(x) := dist(x, {u1 = l}) \u2212 g (x, dist(x, {u2 = \u2212l}))\nis also convex. Since K2 \u2208 B, we know that G \u2265 0. But we have just\nshown that G vanishes for all extremal points of K2 . Then, if x0 is a finite\nlinear combination of extremal points, then we must have G(x0 ) = 0, which\nconcludes the argument and also the proof of Theorem 6.10.\nFor the regularity of the free boundary, just note that if g is bounded\nfrom below by a positive constant, then \u2202K2 satisfies the interior ball condition. Since K2 is convex, we may conclude that \u2202K2 \u2208 C 1,1 .\nWe finish this section with a uniform separation result, in the spirit of\nTheorem 5.1 from [6] for the classical Bernoulli problem:\n42\n\n\fTheorem 6.15. Let H be the set of configurations (K1 , K2 , K3 ) such that\nK1 , K2 , K3 are convex bounded domains satisfying\n\u2022 K1 \u22d0 K2 \u22d0 K3 ,\n\u2022 K1 satisfies the interior ball condition for radius \u2265 r1 ,\n\u2022 K3 satisfies the interior ball condition for radius \u2265 r3 ,\n\u2022 K2 belongs to the set of supersolutions B from (6.16).\nThen there exists a value \u03b7 = \u03b7(R, r1 , r3 ) such that\ndist(\u2202K1 , \u2202K2 ) \u2265 \u03b7dist(\u2202K1 , \u2202K3 ),\nuniformly for all (K1 , K2 , K3 ) \u2208 H.\nProof. Without loss of generality, assume that dist(\u2202K1 , \u2202K3 ) = 1, otherwise the result follows by rescaling. Let u be the solution of the p-capacitary\nproblem (6.19) and set\n\u03b1 := sup{u(x) : x \u2208 \u2202K2 } \u2208 (\u22121, 1).\nWe claim that there exists a uniform \u03b10 such that for every admissible\nconfiguration we must have \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b10 . For the proof of the claim, it is enough\nto restrict to configurations that have \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1). Let u1 , u2 be as in (6.14).\nConsider the functions\nu1,\u03b1 (x) :=\n\nu(x) \u2212 \u03b1\n;\n1\u2212\u03b1\n\nu2,\u03b1 (x) :=\n\nu(x) \u2212 \u03b1\n1+\u03b1\n\nin the set K3 \\K1 . Then u1 = 1 = u1,\u03b1 on \u2202K1 , while u1,\u03b1 \u2264 0 = u1 on \u2202K2 .\nComparison principle gives that u1,\u03b1 \u2264 u1 in the set K2 \\K 1 . Similarly, since\nu2 = \u22121 = u2,\u03b1 on \u2202K3 and u2,\u03b1 \u2264 0 = u2 on \u2202K2 , we arrive at u2,\u03b1 \u2264 u2\nin the set K3 \\K 2 .\nChoose x0 \u2208 \u2202K2 such that u(x0 ) = \u03b1. Because K2 is a supersolution,\nwe must have\ndist(x0 , {u1 = l}) \u2265 g(x0 , dist(x0 , {u2 = \u2212l})).\nOn the other hand, since we had that u1,\u03b1 \u2264 u1 in K2 \\K 1 ,\ndist(x0 , {u1 = l} \u2264 dist(x0 , {u1,\u03b1 = l}) = dist(x0 , {u = l(1 \u2212 \u03b1) + \u03b1}).\n\n43\n\n\fIn addition, the relation u2,\u03b1 \u2264 u2 in K3 \\K 2 gives\ndist(x0 , {u2 = \u2212l} \u2265 dist(x0 , {u2,\u03b1 = \u2212l}) = dist(x0 , {u = \u2212l(1 + \u03b1) + \u03b1}).\nBy hypothesis, g is a non-decreasing function, so the previous three inequalities give the relation\n(6.20) dist(x0 , {u = l(1 \u2212 \u03b1) + \u03b1}) \u2265 g(x0 , dist(x0 , {u = \u2212l(1 + \u03b1) + \u03b1})).\nTaking into account that u(x0 ) = \u03b1, we may now estimate\ndist(x0 , {u = l(1 \u2212 \u03b1) + \u03b1}) \u2264\n\nl(1 \u2212 \u03b1)\nl(1 \u2212 \u03b1)\n\u2264\ninf |\u2207u|\nm1\n\nfor some m1 depending on r1 , where we are using Lemma 2.6 to bound the\ngradient from below. Moreover,\ndist(x0 , {u = \u2212l(1 + \u03b1) + \u03b1}) \u2265\n\nl(1 + \u03b1)\nl(1 + \u03b1)\n\u2265\n,\nsup |\u2207u|\nm2\n\nwhere m2 = m2 (r2 ) is given in Corollary 2.5. Formula (6.20) and the monotonicity of g yield to\n\u0012\n\u0013\nl(1 + \u03b1)\nl(1 \u2212 \u03b1)\n\u2265 g x0 ,\n.\nm1\nm2\nBy hypothesis (H4) on g it holds\n(6.21)\n\nl(1 \u2212 \u03b1)\nl(1 + \u03b1)\n\u2265 c1\n,\nm1\nm2\n\nfor c1 depending on m2 .\nNote that m1 and m2 depend on the distance dist(\u2202K1 , \u2202K3 ) = 1, and\non the initial constants r1 , r3 . But then, (6.21) already implies that \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b10\nfor some \u03b10 . The claim is proved.\nFinally, to complete the proof of the theorem, one uses Lemma 5.3 in\n[6].\nRemark 6.16. If we relax the hypothesis on the domains K1 , K3 to only\na interior cone condition, then we can use the uniform C \u03b2 estimate from\nCorollary 2.4 instead of the gradient estimate, and still obtain a uniform\nseparation result.\n\n44\n\n\f6.4\n\nA Brunn-Minkowski inequality\n\nGiven two domains \u03a91 and \u03a92 \u2282 RN , we define their Minkowski linear\ncombination \u03a9t as\n\u03a9t := (1 \u2212 t)\u03a90 + t\u03a91 ,\n\nt \u2208 [0, 1].\n\nNotice that if \u03a90 , \u03a91 are convex sets, so is \u03a9t .\nAn upper semicontinuous function u : RN \u2192 R \u222a {\u00b1\u221e} is said to be\nquasi-concave if it has convex superlevel sets, or, equivalently, if\nu((1 \u2212 t)x0 + tx1 ) \u2265 min{u(x0 ), u(x1 )},\n\nfor all t \u2208 [0, 1], x0 , x1 \u2208 RN .\n\nIf u is defined only in a proper subset \u03a9 in RN , we extend u as \u2212\u221e in\nRN \\\u03a9 and we say that u is quasi-concave in \u03a9 if such an extension is quasiconcave in RN . In an analogous way, u is quasi-convex if \u2212u is quasi-concave.\nObviously, if u is concave (convex), then it is quasi-concave (quasi-convex).\nConsider u0 , u1 two upper semicontinuous functions defined in \u03a90 , \u03a91 \u2282\nN\nR , respectively, and let t \u2208 [0, 1]; the Minkowski linear combination of\nu0 and u1 is the upper semicontinuous function u\u2217t whose super-level sets\n(t)\nLl := {u\u2217t \u2265 l} are the Minkowski linear combination of the super-level\n(1)\n(0)\nsets Ll , Ll of u0 , u1 , respectively, i.e.,\n(t)\n\n(0)\n\nLl = (1 \u2212 t)Ll\nand\n\n(1)\n\n+ tLl ,\n(t)\n\nu\u2217t (x) = sup{l : x \u2208 Ll }.\nThe notion of quasi-concavity has already been used in the study of the\nclassical Bernoulli problem in the papers [15, 49], for instance. Here we plan\nto extend those results to the distance problems (PE ) and (PI ). It turns\nout that the proofs seem to be very well adapted for the case of distance\nbetween level sets.\nOur first proposition deals with the exterior case:\nProposition 6.17. Fix l \u2208 (0, 1). Let K0 , K1 be two bounded convex domains in RN , and \u03bb0 , \u03bb1 two given positive constants. For t \u2208 [0, 1], define\ntheir Minkowski sum\nKt := (1 \u2212 t)K0 + tK1 ,\n\nand\n\n\u03bbt := (1 \u2212 t)\u03bb0 + t\u03bb1 .\n\nDenote by (u0 , \u03a90 ), (u1 , \u03a91 ), (ut , \u03a9t ) the solutions of the exterior distance\nproblem (PE ) for given data (K0 , \u03bb0 , l), (K1 , \u03bb1 , l) and (Kt , \u03bbt , l), respectively. Then\n(6.22)\n\n(1 \u2212 t)\u03a90 + t\u03a91 \u2283 \u03a9t .\n45\n\n\fProof. Let \u03a9\u0303t := (1 \u2212 t)\u03a90 + t\u03a91 ; Consider the Minkowski sum u\u2217t of the\nfunctions u0 and u1 . Then for every level set s \u2208 [0, 1], we have that\n{u\u2217t \u2265 s} = (1 \u2212 t){u0 \u2265 s} + t{u1 \u2265 s}.\nLet x \u2208 \u2202 \u03a9\u0303t and y \u2208 {u\u2217t = l}. Then there exist x0 \u2208 \u2202\u03a90 and x1 \u2208 \u2202\u03a91\nsuch that x = (1 \u2212 t)x0 + tx1 and as a consequence,\ndist(x, y) \u2265 (1\u2212t)dist(x0 , {u0 = l})+tdist(x1 , {u1 = l}) = (1\u2212t)\u03bb0 +t\u03bb1 = \u03bbt .\nThis implies that \u03a9\u0303t \u2208 B\u03bbt .\nSince the solution of the problem (PE ) for given initial data (Kt , \u03bbt ) is\ngiven as the minimal set in the class B\u03bbt , we arrive at \u03a9\u0303t \u2283 \u03a9t , as desired.\nRemark 6.18. We conjecture that equality in (6.22) holds if and only if K0\nand K1 are homothetic.\nWe consider now the interior counterpart: let l \u2208 (0, 1) and be \u03a9 a\nconvex domain in RN . Denote by \u039b(\u03a9) := \u03bb\u03a9,max the Bernoulli constant\nfor the (interior) distance problem defined in (4.4).\nProposition 6.19. Fix l \u2208 (0, 1). Let \u03a90 , \u03a91 be two bounded convex domains in RN , and \u03bb0 \u2264 \u039b(\u03a90 ), \u03bb1 \u2264 \u039b(\u03a91 ) two given positive constants.\nFor t \u2208 [0, 1], define\n\u03a9t := (1 \u2212 t)\u03a90 + t\u03a91 ,\n\nand\n\n\u03bbt := (1 \u2212 t)\u03bb0 + t\u03bb1 .\n\nDenote by (u0 , K0 ), (u1 , K1 ), (ut , Kt ) the solutions of the interior distance\nproblem (PI ) for given data (\u03a90 , \u03bb0 , l), (\u03a91 , \u03bb1 , l) and (\u03a9t , \u03bbt , l), respectively.\nThen\n(6.23)\n\n(1 \u2212 t)K0 + tK1 \u2282 Kt .\n\nProof. By definition of the Bernoulli constant (4.4), there exist convex sets\nK0 \u22d0 \u03a90 , K1 \u22d0 \u03a91 , whose p-capacitary potentials u0 and u1 , respectively,\nsatisfy dist(xi , {ui = l}) \u2265 \u03bbi , for all xi \u2208 \u2202Ki , i = 0, 1.\nLet u\u2217t be the Minkowski addition of the quasi-convex functions u0 and\nu1 ; u\u2217t is a quasi-convex function whose sublevel sets are the Minkowski\nlinear combination of the corresponding sublevel sets of u0 and u1 , i.e.\n{u\u2217t \u2264 s} = (1 \u2212 t){u0 \u2264 s} + t{u1 \u2264 s} for all s \u2208 [0, 1].\nWe define K\u0303t := {u\u2217t = 0}; note that K\u0303t = (1 \u2212 t)K0 + tK1 .\n46\n\n\fThen by a purely geometrical argument we can show that if x \u2208 \u2202 K\u0303t\nand y \u2208 {u\u2217t = l}, then we may find x0 \u2208 \u2202K0 , x1 \u2208 \u2202K1 such that\ndist(x, y) \u2265 (1 \u2212 t)dist(x0 , {u0 = l}) + tdist(x1 , {u1 = l}) \u2265 (1 \u2212 t)\u03bb0 + t\u03bb1 .\nHence for all x \u2208 \u2202 K\u0303t it holds\ndist(x, {u\u2217t = l}) \u2265 \u03bbt .\nThe inequality above implies that the set \u03a9t belongs to the class B\u03bbt . Since\nthe set Kt , solution of the interior distance problem (PI ), is constructed as\nthe largest set in the class B\u03bbt , then one automatically obtains that\n(1 \u2212 t)K0 + tK1 = K\u0303t \u2282 Kt .\n\nAs a consequence, we obtain a Brunn-Minkowski inequality for \u039b(\u03a9) in\nthe spirit of the (Newtonian) capacitary inequalities of [16]:\nCorollary 6.20. Fix l \u2208 (0, 1). Let \u03a90 , \u03a91 be two bounded convex domains\nin RN . For each t \u2208 (0, 1), define\n\u03a9t := (1 \u2212 t)\u03a90 + t\u03a91 .\nThen\n(6.24)\n\n\u039b(\u03a9t ) \u2265 (1 \u2212 t)\u039b(\u03a90 ) + t\u039b(\u03a91 ).\n\nConjecture 6.21. We conjecture that equality in (6.24) holds if and only\nif \u03a90 and \u03a91 are homothetic. One may also compare the Bernoulli constant\n\u039b(\u03a9) to the Bernoulli constant of a ball with the same mean width, and\nobtain (sharp) isoperimetric inequalities. Another open problem is whether\nuniqueness of solution for \u03bb = \u039b(\u03a9) holds.\n\n7\n7.1\n\nConcluding Remarks\nAn alternative approach for Numerical computation\n\nOne of the major problems in designing numerical algorithms for the (interior and exterior) classical Bernoulli problem, as well as for the formulation\npresented in this manuscript, is related to the fact that the set \u03a9 (for the\nexterior case), or K (for the interior case) is unknown and chosen by the\n47\n\n\fsolution. Consequently, to impose numerically the gradient or the distance\ncondition to the solution itself at the unknown boundary becomes a nontrivial task.\nConsider for a moment the exterior discrete Bernoulli problem (the interior can be treated similarly)\n(\n\u2206p u = 0 in \u03a9 \\ K, u = 1 in K, u = 0 on \u2202\u03a9,\n(PE )\ndist(x, {u = \u03bb\u03c9}) = \u03bb for all x \u2208 \u2202\u03a9,\nand the classical one\n(\n\u2206p u = 0 in \u03a9 \\ K, u = 1 in K,\n(PB )\n|\u2207u| = \u03c9 for all x \u2208 \u2202\u03a9.\n\nu = 0 on \u2202\u03a9,\n\nThe numerical implementation of a distance condition between two level\nsets of a p-harmonic function might be easier than the implementation of\na gradient condition on a level set. Moreover we have rigorously shown in\nthe previous sections that solutions of (PE ) converge to solutions of (PB ) as\n\u03bb \u2192 0.\nBased on these two observations, we propose the following algorithm\nto numerically approximate solutions to problem (PE ) and consequently\nsolutions to (PB ). Fix the set K \u2282 RN and (un\u22121 , \u03a9n\u22121 ) solution of (P\u03a9 )\nwith \u03a9 = \u03a9n\u22121 :\n1. Let B\u03bb (x) be the ball of radius \u03bb and centrum in x; define\n[\nB\u03bb (x)\n\u03a9n := {un\u22121 \u2265 \u03bb\u03c9} \u222a\nx\u2208\u0393n\u22121\n\nwith \u0393n\u22121 = {x \u2208 \u03a9n\u22121 , | un\u22121 (x) = \u03bb\u03c9}.\n2. If \u03a9n\u22121 = \u03a9n the couple (\u03a9n\u22121 , un\u22121 ) is a solution for (PE ).\n\u03a9n\u22121 6= \u03a9n solve (P\u03a9 ) with \u03a9 = \u03a9n .\n\nIf\n\n3. Let (un , \u03a9n ) be a solution of (P\u03a9 ) with \u03a9 = \u03a9n . Restart from step 1.\nfor n \u2192 n + 1.\nHence a numerical algorithm for (PB ) consists on solving (PE ) with the\nscheme {1., 2., 3.} for a decreasing sequence of values for \u03bb.\nWe remark the reader that estimates showing convergence and stability\nof algorithm {1., 2., 3.} are not provided in this manuscript but are very\ninteresting open questions.\n48\n\n\f7.2\n\nOpen problems\n\nLet K \u22d0 \u03a9 be two bounded domains in RN . Let u \u2208 C 2 (\u03a9\\K) \u2229 C(\u03a9) be a\nclassical solution of the Dirichlet problem\n\uf8f1\n2\nin \u03a9\\K,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 F (x, u, \u2207u, D u) = 0\nu=0\non \u2202\u03a9,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nu=1\non \u2202K,\n\nwhere F (x, t, p, A) is a proper and (degenerate) elliptic operator defined\non RN \u00d7 R \u00d7 RN \u00d7 S N (here S N denotes the set of real symmetric n \u00d7 n\nmatrices). If both K and \u03a9 are convex, the natural question to ask is whether\nall the level sets of u are convex. i.e. whether u is a quasi-convex function.\nWithout suitable assumptions on F , the answer can be negative (see [55]) for\ninstance. Before dealing with the classical Bernoulli or the discrete version of\nit presented in this manuscript, one should aim to find sufficient conditions\non F which guarantee that u is a quasi-convex function. An answer to\nthis question for the p-Laplacian operator can be found in Lemma 2.8 and\nLemma 5.3 for respectively the convex and star-shaped domains. Note that\nfor a general F , the problem was considered in [58].\nAnother interesting open question is whether any solution to (PE ) (or\nto (PI )) satisfies the so called normal vector property: a solution (u, \u03a9) to\n(PE ) satisfies the normal vector property if given any point x0 \u2208 \u2202\u03a9 the line\nperpendicular to the boundary \u2202\u03a9 at x0 intersects the convex hull of K, as\nin Figure ??. Similar questions have been addressed for reaction-diffusion\nequations in the context of front-propagation (Jones' Lemma, see [39, 12]).\nFinally, one may also consider cases in which the condition (1.1) is replaced by\ndist(x, {u = 0}) = \u03bb, \u2200x \u2208 {u = l},\nor, even more general, by the distance between any two levels sets. Such\nproblems fall outside the scope of this paper and are left as open questions.\nA still open and tantalizing problem concerns the formulation of the discrete Bernoulli problem considered here via a suitable variational functional.\nThe next question would then be to formulate suitable isoperimetric problems, in the spirit of [24].\n\nAcknowledgments: M.d.M Gonzalez is supported by grants MTM200806349-C03-01 and MTM2011-27739-C04-01 (from the Spanish government),\n49\n\n\fand 2009SGR345 (from Generalitat de Catalunya).
