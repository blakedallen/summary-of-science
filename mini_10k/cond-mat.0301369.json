In this article, the theory of\nthermoelectric effects are reinvestigated for insulators or semiconductors at\nlow temperatures. It is found that the famous relations established by Lord\nKelvin for metals in 1851 must be modified for insulators in order to be consistent with the third law of the thermodynamics. Effects of strong correlation\nare discussed.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nRecently, some of the strongly correlated materials are attracting renewed interests\nbecause of a possibility for a new and efficient themoelectric device.[1] Especially,\nthe compounds called as the Kondo insulators[2] show rather large thermopower\nat low temperatures, being suitable for a refrigerator without coolant in the lower\ntemperature range. It seems, however, that the theory for the thermoelectric effects\nhas not yet been fully developped for the insulators and for the systems with strong\ncorrelation.\nIn this article, we will focus on the theory of the thermoelectric effect in insulators\nand point out for the first time that the famous Kelvin's relations, which were\nanalyzed and established by Lord Kelvin[3] 150 years ago, must be modified in the\ncase of the insulators at low temperature limit. Next, we will discuss effects of\nmany-body interactions on the thermoelectric coefficients and give a formula for the\nheat current. We will also explain how the behaviour of the thermopower due to\nthe non-interacting electrons or holes in ordinary semiconductors might be changed\nin the Kondo insulators with strong correlations at low temperatures.\n\n\f7\u000e\n\n7\u0013\n\n\u22067\n\n7\n\n7\u0013\n\nPHWDO\u0003E\n$\n\nPHWDO\u0003D\n\n%\n\n&\n\nPHWDO\u0003D\n\n'\n\nFigure 1: A schematic figure to derive Kelvin's relations. A unit charge is quasistatically moved along the path ABCDA to prove Kelvin's relation.\n\n2\n\nReconsideration of Kelvin's relation in insulators\n\nLord Kelvin[3, 4] analyzed a system depicted in Fig. 1 which consists of the metals a\nand b. The temperature difference between B and C is set equal to \u2206T . (Note that\nthe direction of the gradient is opposite to that in ref.[4]) A unit charge is quasistatically moved along the path ABCDA. Thereby the Peltier heat \u03c0ab (T + \u2206T ) is\nemitted at B and \u03c0ab (T ) is absorbed at C. The Thompson heat \u03c4b \u2206T is emitted\nbetween BC and \u03c4a \u2206T is absorbed between AB and CD. On transfering the charge\nfrom D to A the work Sab \u2206T is done outwards due to the thermoelectric voltage.\nThus we can set up the following equations to express the first and the second laws\nof the thermodynamics:\n\u2212 Sab (T )\u2206T + \u03c0ab (T + \u2206T ) \u2212 \u03c0ab (T ) + (\u03c4b \u2212 \u03c4a )\u2206T = 0,\n\u03c0ab (T + \u2206T ) \u03c0ab (T ) \u03c4b \u2212 \u03c4a\n\u2212\n+\n\u2206T = 0,\nT + \u2206T\nT\nT\nand derive the famous Kelvin's relations:\nSab (T ) =\n\n\u03c0ab (T )\n,\nT\n\nSab (T ) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nT\n\n\u03c4a (T \u2032 ) \u2212 \u03c4b (T \u2032 ) \u2032\ndT\nT\u2032\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the Seebeck coefficient is related to \u0398ab by Sab = \u0398ab /\u2206T . It is well known\nthat the absolute Seebeck coefficient is given by S \u2243 \u2212(Ec \u2212 \u03bc)/|e|T for the semiconductors at low temperatures when the carriers are electron-like, hence Sab =\nSa \u2212 Sb \u2243 (Ecb \u2212 Eca )/|e|T . Here, Ec and \u03bc denote the conduction band edge and\nthe chemical potential, respectively. However, according to the first equation in\n(3), \u03c0ab (T \u2192 0) \u2192 (Ecb \u2212 Eca )/|e|, whereas S(T ) must vanish at T \u2192 0 due to\nthe second equation in (3). The former means that one can remove finite amount\nof heat from the body at absolute zero temperature, violating the third law of the\nthermodynamics.\nThis contradiction seems to have occured because we have neglected the work\nnecessary to move a negative charge from the bottom of the conduction band at Eca\nto the region in the middle with the band edge Ecb when Ecb > Eca and T \u2192 0, as\nshown in Fig. 2. In this case, we have to add a term W = (Ecb \u2212 Eca )/|e| in eq. (1),\nwhich leads to the modified Kelvin's relations,\nSab (T ) =\n\n\u03c0ab (T ) Ecb \u2212 Eca\n+\n,\nT\n|e|T\n\n(4)\n\n\fH\u000f\n7\u000e\u22067\n\n(F\u000e\n\n(FD\n\n7\n\nFigure 2: The hatched regions indicate the conduction bands, whereas the region\nbeneath them are the gaps.

Thus,\nthe diverging behavior of S at low temperature limit can be understood as due to\nthe necessary 'work' W to move a charge from the lower to the higher bottom of\nthe conduction bands at low temperature limit. The heat which can be removed\n(Q = \u03c0ab (T ) + (\u03c4a \u2212 \u03c4b )T ) must vanish at T \u2192 0 in this representation, and the\nfinite value \u03c0ab \u2192 (Ecb \u2212 Eca )/|e| is an artifact of regarding the work to be done\nas the heat to be removed. (See Fig.3 to understand how the cooling apparatus\nworks as a thermodynamic cycle.) Onsager's relation (eq.(3)) does not hold, since\nthe linear response theory is not applicable in the present case at T \u2192 0. Thus,\nSab (T ) \u2192 (Ecb \u2212 Eca )/|e|T still holds but \u03c0ab (T ) \u2192 0 at T \u2192 0. Note that the\nequations (4) and (5) hold only at the low temperature limit and a more general\nexpressions at arbitrary temperature are still to be found. Thereby, the inclusion of\nthe nonequilibrium effects will be necessary.\n\n3\n\nSeebeck coefficient and many-body effect\n\nA general theory for the thermoelectric transport has been developped by Mahan,[5]\nand recently by Kontani[6] further, based on the Fermi liquid theory. It should be\nnoted that the heat conveyed by the carriers is not equal to \u01ebk \u2212 \u03bc but a correction\ndue to the interaction exists. For example, the heat current is given by\njQ =\n\nX\nk\u03c3\n\n(\u01ebk \u2212 \u03bc)v k c+\nk\u03c3 ck\u03c3 + U\n\nX\nk\u03c3\n\n\u0012\n\nv k c+\ni\u03c3 cj\u03c3\n\nni\u2212\u03c3 + nj\u2212\u03c3\n2\n\n\u0013\n\nk\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\n\ffor the Hubbard model, where (* * *)k denotes the Fourier transformation from i, j\nto k. The Seebeck coefficient, however, can be expressed by the following simple\nformula\n\u0011\n\u0010\nR\nd\u01eb(\u01eb \u2212 \u03bc)L(\u01eb) \u2212 \u2202f\n1\n\u2202\u01eb\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(7)\nS(T ) = \u2212\nR\n\u2202f\n|e|T\nd\u01ebL(\u01eb) \u2212 \u2202\u01eb\n2\n[ImG(k, \u01eb)]2 /\u03c0N when the vertex corrections (VC's) can be\nwith L(\u01eb) = k vxk\nneglected, as would be the case for the heavy-fermion compounds. VC's cannot be\nneglected for high Tc cuprates.[6] It should be noted that the second term in eq. (6)\ndue to the interaction does not appear in the factor (\u01eb \u2212 \u03bc) in eq. (7). It is because\nall the interaction effects were absorbed in the Green's function (and in the VC's).\nThe electronic states of the Kondo insulators can be described most simply by\nthe periodic Anderson model at half-filling. (A more realistic model will be discussed\nin [10].) The Coulomb interaction between f-electrons produces a finite imaginary\npart of the self-energy at finite temperatures. This makes the quasi-particle density\nof states finite within the gap at T > 0. Therefore, the Seebeck coefficient of the\nKondo insulators becomes metal-like S(T ) \u221d T at low but finite temperatures,[7]\nwhereas S(T ) \u221d T \u22121 at higher temperatures. It could be the case that S vanishes\nas an activation type S(T ) \u221d exp(\u2212Eg /kB T ) at the low temperature limit. These\npredictions are qualitatively consistent with the observed behaviors,[8, 9] but the\neffect of the nonstoichiometry may not be neglected. Both interpretations seem\npossible for analyzing the experimental results.\n\nP\n\n4\n\nSummary\n\nThe thermoelectric effect in insulators or semiconductors was reinvestigated theoretically. It was found that the famous relations established by Lord Kelvin for the\nthermoelectric coefficients must be modified at low temperature limit in order to be\nconsistent with the third law of the thermodynamics. Many-body effect was also\ndiscussed and it was noted that S(T ) \u221d T or \u221d exp(\u2212Eg /kB T ) at low temperatures\ndue to the interaction effect. To elucidate the low temperature behavior, it may\nbe necessary to consider the nonequilibrium effect of coupled electron and phonon\nsystems.\nThis work is supported by the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the\nMinistry of Education, Science, Sports, Culture, and Technology.\n\nReferences\nReferences\n[1] G.
