INTRODUCTION\n\nThe recent observation of gravitationally redshifted\natomic transition lines during type I X-ray bursts on the\nlow-mass X-ray binary, EXO 0748-676 (Cottam, Paerels\n& Mendez 2002, hereafter CPM) opens a new window\non neutron star (NS) structure. Using 335 ks of XMMNewton observations during its calibration and commissioning phase, CPM collected 3.2 ks of Type I bursts\nwhich was split into a high temperature part (kB TBB \u2248\n1.8 keV) and a low temperature part (kB TBB < 1.5 keV).\nIn the high temperature part they identified the H\u03b1\n(n = 2 \u2192 3) transition of hydrogenic Fe with a redshift of z=0.35. The same transition was identified for\nHe-like Fe with the same redshift in the low temperature\npart. Though this is not the first claim of an absorption feature during type I X-ray bursts, previous Tenma\nand EXOSAT observations of a 4.1 keV absorption feature on 2S 1636-536 (Waki et al. 1984; Turner & Breedon 1984), EXO 1747-214 (Magnier et al. 1989) and\nX1608-52 (Nakamura, Inoue & Tanaka 1988) were never\nconfirmed with more sensitive instruments. CPM's observation is unique in that two lines in distinct states of\nthe type I burst with the same redshift were observed,\nimplying that we are seeing the NS surface.\nIn our previous work (Bildsten, Chang & Paerels 2003,\nhereafter BCP), we explained how Fe can be present\nabove the accreting NS photosphere. The larger entropy\n\nof the photosphere forbids convective mixing from the\ndeeper burning regions (Joss 1977), making it unlikely\nthat Fe is dredged up. In addition, the strong surface\ngravity rapidly depletes Fe from the upper atmosphere\nvia sedimentation1 . However, continual accretion during\nthe burst at fairly modest rates (\u1e40 > 10\u221212 M\u2299 yr\u22121 )\ncan overcome Fe sedimentation. For EXO 0748-676, the\npersistent flux implies \u1e40 > 2 \u00d7 10\u221210 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (Gottwald\net al. 1986; CPM) and the sub-Eddington burst luminosity is unlikely to halt the accretion flow (see observations\nof GX 17+2; Kuulkers et al. 2002).\nIf accretion is the source of the Fe that generates the\nabsorption line, then accretion must be spread over a\nlarge fraction of the star. Since the NS surface is inside the last stable orbit for the implied radius of R =\n4.4GM/c2 (CPM), the protons may reach the NS surface\nwith a kinetic energy of \u2248 200 \u2212 300 MeV/nucleon, and\ndecelerate via Coulomb scattering (Zel'dovich & Shakura\n1969). This filters ions by their charge and mass, stopping incident Fe above the photosphere at a column\nof \u2248 1 g cm\u22122 (Bildsten, Salpeter & Wasserman 1992).\nThe Fe remains there until it is either destroyed by incident protons (for \u1e40 > 10\u221213 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ) or sediments\nout. The deposition and nuclear destruction of Fe both\n1 Radiative levitation is a possible mechanism by which the Fe\nis suspended (BCP), an issue we will address in \u00a7 3.3.\n\n\f2\n\nChang, Bildsten & Wasserman\n\ndepend linearly on \u1e40 and hence the steady state Fe\ncolumn is independent of \u1e40 when nuclear destruction\ndominates. For accretion of solar metallicity material,\nNFe \u2248 3.4 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 (BCP). While this Fe column is\nsimilar to a uniformly abundant solar metallicity atmosphere (NFe \u2248 5 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 ), the accretion/spallation\nscenario also predicts a plethora of elements with Z < 26\nproduced by proton spallation of Fe (BCP, Table 1).\nIn this paper, we discuss the physics of line transfer through a thin Fe layer above the continuum photosphere. Previous theoretical work on the formation\nof spectral features focused on the Fe Ly\u03b1 line and\nedge (Foster et al. 1987; Day, Fabian & Ross 1992).\nHowever, these calculations presumed LTE and uniform\nabundance. In \u00a7 2 we show that LTE is a poor assumption as the radiation field dominates the level population and ionization balance (London, Taam & Howard\n1986; BCP). We also discuss the line broadening physics\nand show that Stark broadening dominates for Fe H\u03b1.\nWe calculate in \u00a7 3 the Fe column needed to produce\nthe observed H\u03b1 line and compare it to the Fe column\nfrom accretion/spallation. We also estimate the equivalent width of the resulting Ly\u03b1 and P\u03b1 transition, and\nconstrain the rotation rate of the NS from the observed\nlinewidth. We close by estimating the Fe column that\nmight be sustained by radiative levitation, and summarize our results in \u00a7 4.\n2. MODEL ATMOSPHERES\n\nWe model the thin Fe line forming region as a one-zone\nscattering layer (Mihalas 1978) at fixed temperature and\ndensity that is illuminated from below by the continuum photosphere (see Figure 1). We consider radiation\nand gas temperatures of kB Tg \u2248 kB Teff \u2248 1 \u2212 2 keV,\nin which case the atmospheric microphysics is simplified.\nThe continuum opacity, \u03bacont = \u03baabs + \u03baTh , where \u03baabs\nis the absorption opacity (mostly free-free) and \u03baTh is\nthe Thomson scattering opacity, is dominated by electron scattering. Bound-free transitions are suppressed\nsince most atoms are fully ionized (Pavlov, Shibanov &\nZavlin 1991; London et al. 1986). We do not consider\nthe global problem of the thermal spectra from a bursting NS (for a review see Lewin, Van Paradijs & Taam\n1993 and references therein), but rather the simplified\nproblem of line transport in the Fe layer. The spectra\nfrom a bursting neutron star, whose opacity is scattering\ndominated, is expected to be non-Planckian (Zeldovich\n& Shakura 1969; Castor 1974; Madej 1974; van Paradijs\n1982). For our purposes, we take the color correction\ngiven by Madej, Joss & Rozanska (2004) (also see Madej\n1991) to relate the observed color temperature to the effective temperature. The effect of the color correction is\nnearly offset by the measured redshift correction. Hence\nthe observed color temperature at infinity is roughly the\neffective temperature at the surface. For the sake of simplicity, we approximate the continuum flux with a blackbody at the effective temperature. However, we will discuss the effect of the spectral shape of the continuum flux\non our results in \u00a7 3.1.\nWe assume that the continuum is formed below the line\nforming region and is freely streaming. The equation of\nradiative transfer is then (Mihalas 1978)\n\u2202I\u03bd\n= \u2212 (\u03baabs + \u03baTh + \u03c8l \u03c6\u03bd ) I\u03bd + \u03baabs B\u03bd + \u03baTh J\u03bd\n\u03bc\n\u2202y\n\n....\n....\n.. ...\n\nOutgoing Flux\n....\n....\n.. ...\n\n...\n....\n.. ...\n\n...\n.....\n.. ...\n\nFe layer\n.\n....\n.....\n.. ..\n\n.\n.....\n.....\n.. ..\n\n.\n.....\n...\n.. ..\n\nystop\n\n.\n.....\n.....\n.. ..\n\n\u0019 1g\n\n\u0019 1 8 keV\n:\n\nne\n\n2\n\n.\n.....\n.....\n.. ..\n\nIn oming Flux\n\nkT\n\nm\n\n\u0019 1023\n\nm\n\n3\n\nPhotosphere\n\nFig. 1.- Schematic model of the line forming region in a NS\natmosphere during a Type I burst.\n\n+\u01eb\u03c8l \u03c6\u03bd B\u03bd + (1 \u2212 \u01eb) \u03c8l\n\nZ\n\nR(\u03bd, \u03bd \u2032 )J\u03bd \u2032 d\u03bd \u2032 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere I\u03bd is the frequency\nand angle dependent specific\nR\nintensity, J\u03bd = (1/2) I\u03bd d\u03bc is the angle-average mean\nintensity, B\u03bd is the Planck function, \u03c8l is the line opacity properly normalized, \u01eb = \u03baabs /\u03batot is the absorbed\nfraction, where \u03batot = \u03bacont + \u03c8l , \u03c6 is the line profile distribution and is determined by the physics of \u00a7 2.1, and\nR(\u03bd, \u03bd \u2032 ) is the redistribution function.

It is sufficiently dense\nso that the intrinsic broadening of the hydrogenic Fe\nH\u03b1 line is dominated by the linear Stark effect (Paerels\n1997). The linear Stark effect is only relevant for hydrogenic atoms and breaks down for multi-electron atoms\nwhere the degeneracies of opposite parity states are broken (Bethe & Salpeter 1957). The distribution of the\nelectric microfields is given by the Holtsmark distribution (Mihalas 1978; also see Potekhin, Chabrier, &\nGilles 2002) and the characteristic scale is given from interactions with neighboring protons, E = e/r02 , where\nr0 = (4\u03c0np /3)\u22121/3 = 5 \u00d7 10\u22129 \u03c1\u22121/3 cm is the mean ion\nspacing and \u03c1 = np mp is the density. Hence the scale of\nStark broadening is\n\u2206EStark = h\u2206\u03bdStark \u2248\n\n~2 n2\nme Zr02\n\n\fNeutron Star Line Transport\n\u00112/3 \u0010 n \u00112\n\u0010\nnp\n\u22121\neV, (3)\n\u2248 1.5 Z26\n1023 cm\u22123\n3\nfor the H\u03b1 line, 0.6 eV for the Ly\u03b1 line, and 2.7 eV for the\nP\u03b1 line, where Z26 = Z/26. Note that we have chosen\nthe upper state because of the strong dependence on n.\nThe scale of thermal Doppler broadening is\n\u0012\n\u00131/2\n2kB Tg\n\u2206Eth = h\u2206\u03bdth =\nEtran\nAmp c2\n\u0012\n\u00131/2 \u0012 \u0013\u22121/2 \u0012\n\u0013\nkB Tg\nA\nEtran\n\u2248 0.25\neV,\n(4)\n1 keV\n56\n1.276 keV\nwhere Etran is the line energy, scaled to the H\u03b1 transition\nand A56 = A/56. For Ly\u03b1 and P\u03b1, \u2206Eth \u2248 1.4 eV and\n\u2206Eth \u2248 0.087 eV respectively. Stark broadening dominates the H\u03b1 line and P\u03b1, but thermal Doppler broadening dominates the Ly\u03b1 line. The relative strength of\nStark and thermal Doppler broadening scales like\n\u0012\n\u00131/2\nkB Tg\n\u2206\u03bdth\n\u22121/2\n3\n\u2248 11 Z26\nA26\n\u03bb\u2261\n\u2206\u03bdStark\n1 keV\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u22122\n\u22122/3\nn \u2212 n\u2032\u22122\nnp\n,\n(5)\n1023 cm\u22123\nn2\nwhere n is the upper state and n\u2032 is the lower state. Note\nthe dependence on n and n\u2032 . Depending on the values\nof n and n\u2032 , the relative strengths of the two broadening mechanisms can vary tremendously. For instance for\nthe H\u03b1 transition, \u03bb \u2248 0.17, while for the Ly\u03b1 and P\u03b1\ntransitions \u03bb \u2248 2 and \u2248 0.033 respectively.\nThe timescale of changes p\nin electric microfields is\n2kB Tg /mp is the ther\u03c4El = r0 /vth , where vth =\nmal speed of the perturbing protons.\nAt photospheric temperatures and densities, this gives \u03c4El \u2248\n7 \u00d7 10\u221216 s (kB Tg /1 keV)\u22121/2 (np /1023 cm\u22123 )\u22121/3 , much\nsmaller than the n = 3 \u2192 2 radiative deexcitation\ntimescale of 3.1 \u00d7 10\u221214 s. Since the electric field changes\nduring the time in which the atom absorbs and re-emits\na photon, the energy of the two H\u03b1 photons are uncorrelated. With this in mind, we can assume complete redistribution, greatly simplifying the line transport calculation.\nThe final broadening profile is a convolution of Stark\nand thermal Doppler broadening. In Figure 2, we\nshow these profiles for various values of \u03bb. Asymptotically, the distribution approaches the power law \u221d\n\u22122.5\n(\u2206\u03bd/\u2206\u03bdStark )\n, expected for the Holtsmark distribution (Mihalas 1978). For \u03bb \u226b 1, we recover the thermal\nDoppler profile. For \u03bb \u226a 1, we approach the Holtsmark\ndistribution. Note that for small values of \u03bb, there is a\nsevere deficit at zero shift because this shift corresponds\nto perfect symmetry in the proton distribution. In fact\nfor \u03bb = 0, the probability of a zero shift goes precisely to\nzero. The effect of thermal Doppler broadening is to fill\nin the distribution near zero (see Figure 2). The deficit\nnear zero shift yields an emission-like feature there, which\nmust be interpreted as reduced scattering. This is similar to the \"ghost of Ly\u03b1\" where reduced scattering in the\nline contributes to an emission-like feature in the spectra\nof broad absorption line (BAL) quasars (Arav 1996).\n2.2. NLTE Effects\n\n3\n\nFig. 2.- Distribution of frequency shifts due to a combination\nof thermal Doppler (Voigt) and Stark shifts (Holtsmark) at various\nrelative strengths of each. The x-axis is given in units of \u2206\u03bdStark\nand the relative strengths of each distribution is given by \u03bb =\n\u2206\u03bdth /\u2206\u03bdStark . The limits of \u03bb = 0 and \u03bb \u226b 1 gives the Holtsmark\ndistribution and the Voigt profile respectively.\n\nWe now show that the atomic level populations in the\nphotospheres of bursting neutron stars are not expected\nto be in LTE (London et al. 1986, BCP). For simplicity\nwe only consider a two-level system. The rate equations\nfor the density of upper (nu ) and lower (nl ) states are\nthen,\n0 = nl [Clu + Blu J(Elu )] \u2212 nu [Cul + Aul + Bul J(Elu )] ,\n(6)\nwhere Clu,ul are the collisional rates from the lower to\nupper state and vice versa, A and B are the Einstein\ncoefficients, Elu is the energy of the transition and J is\nthe mean radiation intensity at that energy. We take the\ndipole approximation from Jefferies (1962) for optically\nallowed transitions for the collisional rates:\n\u0013\u22121.68\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\nElu\nElu\n12\nexp \u2212\nClu = 5.5 \u00d7 10\nkB Tg\nkB Tg\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121.5 \u0010\n\u0011\nkB Tg\nne\nflu s\u22121 , (7)\n23\n1 keV\n10 cm\u22123\nwhere flu is the oscillator strength for the transition.\nPutting this all together, we have Clu \u2248 2.2 \u00d7 109 s\u22121\nfor the n = 1 \u2192 2 transition and 1.3 \u00d7 1012 s\u22121 for the\nn = 2 \u2192 3 transition at kB Tg = 1.8 keV. If we compare\nthis to the radiative excitation/deexcitation rates in the\nsame conditions, we find that Blu J(Elu ) = 7 \u00d7 1013 s\u22121\nfor the n = 1 \u2192 2 transition and Rlu = 7 \u00d7 1012 s\u22121 , easily exceeding the collisional rates for the n = 2 \u2192 3 transition at a radiation temperature of kB Teff = 1.8 keV.\nHaving radiative rates exceed collisional rates is not the\nonly prerequisite to break LTE. If the radiation field were\nisotropic and Planckian, we would recover the Boltzmann\ndistribution for the level populations where the relevant\ntemperature setting the level populations is that of the\nradiation. Hence to break LTE, we require the radiation field to be either non-Planckian, anisotropic or both.\nThis is indeed the case above the photosphere where the\n\n\f4\n\nChang, Bildsten & Wasserman\n\nradiation field is free-streaming and the source function\ndeviates from Planckian due to the nature of scattering\ndominated atmospheres (Mihalas 1978). Therefore, to\nsuccessfully model the spectral line formation, we must\nsolve the equations of radiative transfer and statistical\nequilibrium simultaneously.\n3. LINE FORMATION CALCULATIONS\n\nWe Rrewrite equation (1) by defining\nthe flux F\u03bd =\nR\n(1/2) \u03bcI\u03bd d\u03bc and K\u03bd = (1/2) \u03bc2 I\u03bd d\u03bc. Integrating\nequation (1) over d\u03bc and \u03bcd\u03bc we find (Mihalas 1978),\n\u2202F\u03bd\n\u22121\n= \u2212J\u03bd + (1 + \u03b2\u03bd ) [(1 \u2212 \u03c1 + \u01eb\u03b2\u03bd ) B\u03bd + \u03c1J\u03bd\n\u2202\u03c4\u03bd\n\u0015\nZ\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n+ (1 \u2212 \u01eb) \u03b2\u03bd R(\u03bd, \u03bd )J\u03bd d\u03bd ,\n(8)\n\u2202K\u03bd\n= \u2212F\u03bd ,\n\u2202\u03c4\u03bd\n\n(9)\n\nwhere d\u03c4\u03bd\n=\n(\u03baabs + \u03baTh + \u03c8l \u03c6\u03bd ) dy,\n\u03c1\n=\n\u03baTh / (\u03baabs + \u03baTh ) and \u03b2\u03bd\n= \u03c8l \u03c6\u03bd / (\u03baabs + \u03baTh ).\nNote that \u03c4\u03bd is defined from the base of the scattering\nlayer. If we define the variable Eddington factor as\nf\u03bd = K\u03bd /J\u03bd , we can write equation (9) as\n\u2202 2 f \u03bd J\u03bd\n\u22121\n= J\u03bd \u2212 (1 + \u03b2\u03bd ) [(1 \u2212 \u03c1 + \u01eb\u03b2\u03bd ) B\u03bd + \u03c1J\u03bd\n\u2202\u03c4\u03bd2\n\u0015\nZ\n+ (1 \u2212 \u01eb) \u03b2\u03bd R(\u03bd, \u03bd \u2032 )J\u03bd \u2032 d\u03bd \u2032 (10)\n.\nEquation (10) is a generalization of Harrington's (1973)\nequation including the use of variable Eddington factors.\nWe solve equation (10) with a standard methodology\n(Mihalas 1978). Following the nomenclature of Mihalas\n(1978) we define a symmetric and antisymmetric average\nfor the intensity\n1\n(11)\nu\u03bd (\u03c4\u03bd , |\u03bc|) = [I\u03bd (\u03c4\u03bd , |\u03bc|) + I\u03bd (\u03c4\u03bd , \u2212|\u03bc|)]\n2\n1\nv\u03bd (\u03c4\u03bd , |\u03bc|) = [I\u03bd (\u03c4\u03bd , |\u03bc|) \u2212 I\u03bd (\u03c4\u03bd , \u2212|\u03bc|)] ,\n(12)\n2\nwhich combined with the equation of radiative transfer\n(eq.[1]) yields\n\u2202v\u03bd\n= \u2212u\u03bd + S\u03bd ,\n\u2202\u03c4\u03bd\n\u2202u\u03bd\n|\u03bc|\n= \u2212v\u03bd ,\n\u2202\u03c4\u03bd\n|\u03bc|\n\n(13)\n(14)\n\nwhere\nS\u03bd = (1 + \u03b2\u03bd )\u22121 [(1 \u2212 \u03c1 + \u01eb\u03b2\u03bd ) B\u03bd + \u03c1J\u03bd +\n\u0015\nZ\n\u2032\n\u2032\n(1 \u2212 \u01eb) \u03b2\u03bd R(\u03bd, \u03bd )J\u03bd \u2032 d\u03bd\n\n(15)\n\nis the source function. To solve this system of equations,\nwe take an initial guess for the variable Eddington factor,\nf\u03bd , and assume an initial input I\u03bd at the bottom of the\nscattering layer that is isotropic in the outward half space\n(\u03bc \u2265 0). We then solve for J\u03bd in equation (10). We\ncompute S\u03bd given J\u03bd and solve for u\u03bd and v\u03bd in equation\n(13). With u\u03bd and v\u03bd in hand, we compute, I\u03bd , F\u03bd , and\nK\u03bd , compute a new f\u03bd and iterate to convergence.\nSince the atmosphere is in NLTE and scattering dominated, we must simultaneously solve the equations\n\nof radiative transfer (eq.[1]) and statistical equilibrium\n(eq.[6]). For simplicity, we assume a two-level atom and\ncalculate the level populations between the two states\n(in the case of H\u03b1, the two states are the n=2 and n=3\nstates; for Ly\u03b1, n=1 and n=2; for P\u03b1, n=3 and n=4)\nfixing the sum of the two states. We iteratively solve\nthe radiative transfer equation (eq.[1]) and use the computed mean intensities to solve for statistical equilibrium\n(eq.[6]); i.e. \u039b iteration. We define convergence when the\nmean intensity varied by less than \u03b4J/J < 10\u22123 , which\nwas typically achieved in 3-5 iterations.\n3.1. Line Profile and Equivalent Width\n\nWe solve the thin scattering layer illustrated by Figure\n1 with the above technique. However, before we continue,\nwe review the analytic result of a specific case of scattering dominated atmosphere known as Schuster's law\n(Schuster 1905). Assuming that line opacity is dominant\n(\u03b2\u03bd \u226b 1), the absorbed fraction is small (\u01eb \u2192 0), and\nthe scattering is coherent (R(\u03bd \u2032 , \u03bd) = \u03b4\u03bd \u2032 ,\u03bd ), equation\n(10) becomes\n\u2202 2 f \u03bd J\u03bd\n= 0.\n(16)\n\u2202\u03c4\u03bd2\nSolving this equation, we find f\u03bd J\u03bd = A\u03bd \u03c4\u03bd + B\u03bd , where\nA\u03bd and B\u03bd are constants. From equation (9), we also\nfind F\u03bd = f\u03bd A\u03bd .\nWe now make some further approximations to determine A\u03bd and B\u03bd . We assume the Eddington approximation everywhere so that f\u03bd = 1/3 (Rybicki & Lightman 1979). We also assume the two stream approximation, which breaks the radiation field into one outgoing stream (I\u03bd+ = I\u03bd (\u03c4\u03bd , |\u03bc|)) and one incoming stream\n(I\u03bd+ = I\u03bd (\u03c4\u03bd , \u2212|\u03bc|)). Consistency\n\u221a with the Eddington approximation demands |\u03bc| = 1/ 3 (Rybicki & Lightman\n1979). The boundary conditions are that the incoming\n\u221a\nflux at the surface is zero, I\u03bd (\u03c4\u03bd = \u03c4\u03bdtot , \u03bc = \u22121/ 3) = 0,\nwhere \u03c4\u03bdtot is the total optical depth of the scattering\nlayer at frequency \u03bd and that below the line forming region, the incident intensity is fixed at some\n\u221a value typical for Type I bursts (I\u03bd (\u03c4\u03bd = 0, \u03bc = 1/ 3) = Iinc ).\nPer frequency the optical depth of the slab is given by\n\u03c4\u03bdtot = \u03c40tot \u03c6(\u03bd), where \u03c40tot is the normalization of the\noptical depth and is given by\n\u03c40tot = NFe,n=2 \u03c30,23\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0010\n\u0011 \u0012 Z \u0013\u22121\nNFe,n=2\nnp\n\u2248 6.1\n, (17)\n1017 cm\u22122\n1023 cm\u22123\n26\nwhere \u03c30,23 = \u03c0e2 f23 /(me c\u2206\u03bdStark ) is the cross section\nat line center. In the two-stream approximation, our\ndefinitions for the mean intensity and the flux become\n\u0001\n1 +\nI + I\u03bd\u2212\n(18)\nJ\u03bd =\n2 \u03bd\n\u0001\n1\n(19)\nF\u03bd = \u221a I\u03bd+ \u2212 I\u03bd\u2212\n2 3\nand hence solving for A\u03bd and B\u03bd , we find\n2\nItrans = Iinc \u221a\n,\n(20)\ntot\n3\u03c4\u03bd + 2\n\u221a\nwhere Itrans = I\u03bd (\u03c4\u03bd = \u03c4\u03bdtot , \u03bc = 1/ 3) is the transmitted intensity. Equation (20) is known as Schuster's\n\n\fNeutron Star Line Transport\n\n5\n\nNow that we have established the effectiveness of our\nnumerical code, we discuss the nature of the hydrogenic\nFe Ly\u03b1, H\u03b1 and P\u03b1 lines. Since we have limited our\nstudy to two-level atomic systems, the relevant transitions starting from the 1s ground state are 1s \u21c4 2p, 2p\n\u21c4 3d and 3d \u21c4 4f. The fine structure splitting of these\ntransitions significantly complicates the line structure2 .\nDue to fine structure splitting the energy levels of an\nhydrogenic atom are\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\nZ2\n(\u03b1Z)2 1\n3\nEn,j = \u221213.6 2 1 +\neV,\n(21)\n\u2212\nn\nn\nk 4n\nwhere j is the total angular momentum quantum number,\n\u001a\nl\nif j = l \u2212 21\nk=\n(22)\nl + 1 if j = l + 21 ,\n\nFig. 3.- Hydrogenic Fe H\u03b1 line profiles of various values of \u01eb in\nthe line at the NS surface. For the background we take \u03c40tot = 100,\nkB Teff = 1.8 keV and np = 1023 cm\u22123 . The numerical calculation\nof two stream approximation and exact analytic result (eq[20]) are\nindistinguishable and are represented by the thin-solid line. The\nfull numerical results properly angle averaged for complete redistribution are represented by the other curves for various values\nof the absorption ratio \u01eb. The difference between the thin-solid\nline and the thick-solid line are due to the departures of the twostream approximation compared to the full angle-averaged solution\nand coherent scattering compared to complete redistribution. The\ndifference between the other curves are due to different values of \u01eb.\n\nlaw. Note that at large \u03c4\u03bdtot , the specific intensity scales\nwith 1/\u03c4\u03bdtot unlike the absorption dominated case where\nI\u03bd \u2192 B\u03bd at large \u03c4\u03bdtot . This difference in scaling with optical depth between a scattering dominated atmosphere\nand an absorption dominated atmosphere is the key to\nunderstanding the nature of the Fe H\u03b1 line.\nWe compare the flux from our exact numerical calculations with Schuster's law (eq.[20]) in Figure 3. For\nsimplicity of the discussion, we take a simple model of\na hydrogenic atom whose energy levels are defined by\nEn = \u221213.6 Z 2n\u22122 eV, which gives the energy of the Fe\nH\u03b1 transition of 1.2769 keV. We will consider the fully\nrelativistic atom with the complications of fine structure\nsplitting later. We take \u03c40tot = 100, kB Teff = 1.8 keV\nand np = 1023 cm\u22123 for these models. Our numerical\ncalculation for coherent scattering in the two-stream approximation and Schuster's law are indistinguishable and\nare both represented by the thin-solid line. This confirms the accuracy of our numerical treatment with the\nexact analytic result. The other calculations represent\nthe full numerical solutions with complete redistribution\nwith the variable Eddington factor, f\u03bd , computed selfconsistently. These curves are computed with 10 angular\npoints, 100 frequency points and 100 depth points at various values of the absorption coefficient \u01eb. The difference\nbetween the thick-solid line and the thin-solid line is due\nto differences between coherent scattering and complete\nredistribution and the nature of the two-stream approximation which fixes f\u03bd = 1/3 at every point compared\nto the full self-consistent calculation. Note the emissionlike feature at line center, which is due to the deficit near\nzero shift discussed in \u00a7 2.1.\n\nl is the orbital quantum number, and \u03b1 is the fine structure constant. The Ly\u03b1 1s \u21c4 2p transition is fine structure split into two lines with relative line intensities of 2:1\nwith energies of 6.9728 keV and 6.9521 keV, a difference\nof 20.7 eV. The H\u03b1 2p \u21c4 3d transition is split into three\nlines with relative line intensities of 9:1:5 and energies\nof 1.2811 keV, 1.2790 keV, and 1.2997 keV. Taking the\nenergy of the strongest line to be the centroid, the splitting of the levels are 0, -2.1, 18.6 eV (Bethe & Salpeter\n1957). The size of the splitting is comparable to the EW\nand the FWHM of the observed line. Finally the P\u03b1 3d\n\u21c4 4f transition is split into three lines with intensities\n20:1:14 and energy differences of 0, -0.43, 1.61 eV. These\nsplittings are smaller than the effect of Stark broadening,\nso that their effect on the line profile is small.\nWe illustrate the line profile with fine structure splitting in Figure 4. We also turn on statistical equilibrium\nso that from an initial state where the initial population of the two-level atom was assumed to be in the n=2\nstate (with an optical depth normalization of \u03c40tot = 100),\nwe simultaneously solve radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium. Since the opacity is dominated by line\nitself, the absorbed fraction is determined from the ratio of the collisional rate to the total transition rates\n(\u01eb \u2261 \u03baabs /\u03batot \u2248 Clu /(Rlu + Clu )). In statistical equilibrium, \u01eb relaxes to a small value of 0.033, typical of a\nscattering dominated atmosphere. This line profile represents the complete solution to the spectra from the\nresonant scattering layer. Note that the triplet structure\nof the fine structure lines is reduced to a doublet because\nStark broadening is so large.\nThe line's equivalent width (EW) is the proportional\ndeficit and is defined as\n\u0013\nZ \u0012\nF\u03bdline\n(23)\n1 \u2212 cont. d\u03bd.\nEW \u2261\nF\u03bd\nThough rotation will modify the line profile, it conserves equivalent width (Gray 1992) to first order in\n\u03a9R/c, where \u03a9 is the angular rotation rate.

We also simultaneously solve statistical\nequilibrium assuming an initial two-level system with everything\nin the n=2 state with an optical depth normalization of \u03c40tot = 100.\nWith these parameters, statistical equilibrium gives \u01eb \u2248 0.033.\n\nFig. 5.- Fractional Equivalent width as a function of the Fe\ncolumn in the n = 2 state for two different proton densities of\nnp = 5.2\u00d71022 cm\u22123 (dotted line) and np = 1023 cm\u22123 (solid line)\nat kB Teff = 1.8 keV.

We\nalso plot an extremal grey atmosphere model in perfect\nLTE (\u01eb = 1) for comparison. The LTE calculation requires a much larger NFe,n=2 and highlights how poor\nthe LTE calculation fares compared to the full resonant\ncalculation.\n\nFig. 6.- NFe,n=1 , NFe , EWLy\u03b1 , and EWP\u03b1 as a function of\ntotal EWH\u03b1 . for parameters np = 5.2 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22123 (thin lines),\nnp = 1023 cm\u22123 (thick lines) and kB Teff = 1.8 keV. The banded\nregion represents the observed EW and the intersection of these\nlines with the banded region indicates the Fe column (upper plot)\nneeded in the hydrogenic ground state (dashed lines) and total Fe\n(solid lines) and the predicted EW in the Ly\u03b1 line (solid lines;\nlower plot) and P\u03b1 line (dotted lines; lower plot). The P\u03b1 values\nhave been divided by 10 so that they may fit on the same plot.\n\nWe calculate a grid of models for the Ly\u03b1, H\u03b1 and P\u03b1\ntransitions to relate the equivalent widths and level populations in each transition to one another. We estimate\nthe total NFe to that in the n=1 state via Saha equilibrium. Since the radiation field drives ionization, we expect our results from Saha equilibrium will give a lower\nbound on NFe . We relate EWH\u03b1 , NFe,n=1 , NFe , EWLy\u03b1\nand EWP\u03b1 in Figure 6 at two different proton densities:\nnp = 5.2 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22123 (Fe stopping layer; dotted line) and\nnp = 1023 cm\u22123 (solid line). The larger proton density is\nindicative of what would happen in a uniform metallicity\natmosphere. The observed Fe H\u03b1 EW gives an implied\ncolumn of NFe,n=1 \u2248 1 \u2212 2 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 if all the Fe is\nconcentrated in the Fe stopping layer. Saha equilibrium\nthen implies a total Fe column of NFe = 3\u22126\u00d71020 cm\u22122\nat the Fe stopping layer, a factor of \u2248 10 higher than the\nsolar metallicity accretion/spallation scenario. For the\nlarger proton density (np = 1023 cm\u22123 ), the implied Fe\ncolumn is \u2248 1020 cm\u22122 , a factor of two larger than that\nimplied by a uniform solar metallicity photosphere. Since\nionization balance is likely given by the radiation field\n(London et al. 1986), the true NFe is likely even higher\nfor both these scenarios. We also estimate that our implied NFe,n=1 gives an EWLy\u03b1 \u2248 15 \u2212 20 eV (redshifted\n11-15 eV). Though this is larger than EWH\u03b1 , rotational\nbroadening has a large impact on its detectability (see\n\u00a7 3.2). For the P\u03b1 line, the EWP\u03b1 \u2248 4 \u2212 7 eV (redshifted\n3-5 eV) for the observed EWH\u03b1 .\nWe now take kB Teff as a free parameter to understand how our results depend on the color correction\nand spectra. We plot the implied n=1 and total NFe\nas a function of kB Teff at the observed EW in Figure 7. Since we are interested in Fe at the stopping\ncolumn (measured from the top of the atmosphere) of\n\n\fNeutron Star Line Transport\n\nFig. 7.- The Fe column required to generate the observed EW\nin the Fe H\u03b1 line as a function of kB Teff at the Fe stopping column\nof ystop \u2248 1 g cm\u22122 (thin lines) and ystop = 2 g cm\u22122 (thick lines),\nwhich is more representative of a uniform atmosphere. The various\nFe columns represented are the hydrogenic Fe column (dotted-line),\nfully ionized Fe column (dashed-line) and total Fe column (solidline). We find that NFe must at least be a factor of 3-4 larger\nthan that predicted from the accretion/spallation scenario of 3.4 \u00d7\n1019 cm\u22122 (BCP), but is within a factor of 2 of a uniform solar\nmetallicity atmosphere of 5 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 .\n\nystop \u2248 1 g cm\u22122 (thin lines), the local proton density, which is important for Stark broadening, is then\n\u22121\nnp \u2248 9.4 \u00d7 1022 (kB Teff /1 keV) cm\u22123 . The implied Fe\ncolumn is minimized at kB Teff = 1.3 keV, but it is 34 times larger than expected from our solar metallicity\naccretion/spallation scenario. We also plot a similar Fe\ncolumn at ystop = 2 g cm\u22122 (measured from the top of\nthe atmosphere), which is more representative of a uniform atmosphere. From Figure 6 and 7, we find that our\nthe implied Fe column for a solar metallicity atmosphere\nis within a factor of 3 for the entire range of burst temperatures of 1-2 keV. We discuss these points further in\n\u00a7 4.\n3.2. Rotational Broadening\nRotational broadening heavily modifies the structure\nof the lines. We estimate its effects on the line profile as\nfollows. Since the photon occupation number n \u221d I\u03bd /\u03bd 3\nis invariant under Lorentz transformations, the effect of\nrotational broadening on the emergent NS flux is\nZ 2\u03c0\nZ 1\n1\nd\u03c6\nd(cos \u03b8) cos \u03b8\nF\u03bdobs =\n2\u03c0 0\n0\n\u22123\n\n(1 \u2212 (\u03a9R/c) sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6 sin i)\nI (\u03bd(1 \u2212 (\u03a9R/c) sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6 sin i),\ncos \u03b8(1 + (\u03a9R/c) sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6 sin i)) .\n\n(24)\n\nFollowing various authors (Chandrasekhar 1945), we ignore the effect of Lorentz boosts on the angle and focus\non the effects of the frequency shift. We are currently\ncalculating the exact general relativistic calculation elsewhere (Morsink et al. 2005; also see \u00d6zel & Psaltis 2003\nand Bhattacharyya, Miller & Lamb 2004). In addition\n\n7\n\nFig. 8.- Redshifted line profiles for the Fe P\u03b1, H\u03b1, and Ly\u03b1\nat various rotation rates. We fixed the Fe H\u03b1 EW to the observed values and assume that the Fe is concentrated in the accretion/spallation stopping layer. We compare models (from bottom\nto top) at \u03bdspin \u2261 (1 + z)\u22121 \u03a9/(2\u03c0) = 0 Hz (thick-solid lines),\n45 Hz (short-dashed lines), 100 Hz (dotted lines), 200 Hz (longdashed lines), and 300 Hz (dashed-dotted lines) for sin i = 1. We\ndo not include a 300 Hz Ly\u03b1 line profile as it is totally rotationally\nbroadened away.\n\nfor narrow lines, |(dI\u03bd /d ln \u03bd)(\u03a9R/c)| \u226b 1, so we can ignore the effects of the (1 \u2212 \u03a9R/c)3 in the denominator,\nleaving\nZ 2\u03c0\nZ 1\n1\nd\u03c6\nF\u03bdobs =\nd(cos \u03b8) cos \u03b8\n2\u03c0 0\n0\n\u0015\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0014\n\u03a9R\nsin \u03b8 cos \u03c6 sin i , cos \u03b8 , (25)\nI \u03bd 1\u2212\nc\nshowing that rotational line broadening goes like\n(\u03a9R/c) sin i. We plot the Fe P\u03b1, H\u03b1 and Ly\u03b1 lines for a\n1.4M\u2299 NS with R=9. 2km at various rotation rates up to\n300 Hz in Figure 8. To ease comparison with observation,\nwe plot the lines as a function of wavelength and include\nthe redshift correction of z = 0.35. We also include the\n1 + z redshift correction to the rotation rate. For the\nhighest rotation rates (> 200 Hz), the Fe H\u03b1 central line\ndepth would only be about 5-10% below the continuum\nand hence the line would be difficult to detect at the observed EW. At lower rotation rates the doublet nature of\nthe line gives an asymmetric profile with a sharp feature.\nFor the P\u03b1 line, the fine structure splitting in the line is\nsmaller than the Stark effect so it appears as a singlet.\nRotational broadening is more pronounced on the Ly\u03b1\ntransition, which has a FWHM \u2248 130 eV at a spin frequency of 45 Hz. This is 5 times larger than the rotational FWHM for the H\u03b1 line due to the larger energy\nof the Ly\u03b1 transition compared to the H\u03b1 transition. At\nthe implied EWLy\u03b1 matched to the observed EWH\u03b1 , the\nline is extremely shallow with a central line depth of approximately 10%. Hence even at this modest rotation\nrate, the Ly\u03b1 line may be difficult to detect. For larger\nrotation rates (> 100 Hz), Ly\u03b1 is so distributed that it\nmay be impossible to detect.\nObservations of dips and eclipses on EXO 0748-676\n\n\f8\n\nChang, Bildsten & Wasserman\n\n(Parmar et. al. 1986) have revealed that the orbit of\nthe secondary is nearly edge-on (sin i \u2248 1). Assuming\nthe rotation axis of the NS is aligned with the orbit, we\nfavor very low rotation rates (50\u2212100 Hz) for EXO 0748676 compared to the rotation rates that are typically\nobserved in other LMXB systems where the rotation rate\nis typically 300 \u2212 600 Hz (for a review see Strohmayer\n& Bildsten 2003). The recent observation of a 44.7 Hz\nburst oscillation (Villarreal & Strohmayer 2004) is thus\nconsistent with the observation of the line, assuming that\nthis oscillation is indicative of the NS rotation rate. It\nraises the exciting prospect of fitting the line with an\nappropriate spectral calculation to derive the NS radius\n(Morsink et al. 2005). Other accreting NSs may also\npossess atomic lines, but we would not expect them to\nbe detected unless they rotate slowly (< 100 Hz) or are\nhighly inclined.\n3.3. Radiative Levitation\n\nBCP noted that Fe in the atmosphere may be sustained by radiative levitation similar to what occurs in\nhot stars (Michaud 1970; Michaud et al. 1976) and white\ndwarfs (Vauclair, Vauclair & Greenstein 1979; Vennes et\nal. 1988; Chayer, Fontaine & Wesemael 1995). To begin, we calculate the\nR radiative force on a hydrogenic Fe\natom, Frad = c\u22121 \u03c3\u03bd F\u03bd d\u03bd,, from reflection of the incident flux, F\u03bd , where \u03c3\u03bd is the cross section and is defined\nas \u03c3\u03bd = \u03c30,12 \u03c6\u03bd , \u03c30,12 = \u03c0e2 f12 /(me c\u2206\u03bd), \u03c6\u03bd is the convoluted Holtsmark profile, and f12 = 0.42 is the oscillator\nstrength for the Ly\u03b1 transition (Bethe & Salpeter 1957).\nAssuming that the\nR flux does not change as we integrate\nacross the line, \u03c3\u03bd F\u03bd d\u03bd = F\u03bd \u03c0e2 f12 /(me c). For a radiation field that is isotropic in the outward hemisphere,\nF\u03bd = \u03c0B\u03bd (T ) (Rybicki & Lightman 1979), B\u03bd (T ) is the\nPlanck function which we approximate with the Wien\ntail, we find.\n\u0013\n\u0012\nFrad\n6.9 keV\n\u22121\nA\u22121\n(26)\n\u2248 9 \u00d7 103 exp \u2212\n56 g14 ,\nAmp g\nkB Teff\nwhere g14 = g/1014 cm s\u22122 . For kB Teff = 1 keV, the\nradiation force on the Ly\u03b1 exceeds gravity by a factor of\n9 if all the Fe is hydrogenic.\nSince the radiation force exceeds that of gravity, the\nFe will not necessarily sediment. Rather, Fe can be sustained in the atmosphere, allowing for a potential concentration. As the column of Fe builds, more and more\nof the line flux is absorbed which decreases the radiative force. This continues until an equilibrium column is\nreached where enough of the line flux is absorbed that\nthe Fe feels the same net force as a background proton, so that both species have the same scale height\n(Chayer, Fontaine & Wesemael 1995). This is achieved\nwhen the radiative force is equal to the effective force\nFrad = Amp geff = [A \u2212 (Z + 1)/2] mp g, which takes into\naccount the effects of both gravity and the electric field\nfor a hydrogen atmosphere and assumes all the Fe is hydrogenic (Vennes et al. 1988; Chayer, Fontaine & Wesemael 1995).\nWe now estimate the equilibrium column sitting above\nthe continuum photosphere. The radiative force on a\nscattering layer is\nX F\u03bd ,cont EWi\ni\n,\n(27)\nFrad =\nc\nlines\n\nwhere \u03bdi is the energy of the ith line, F\u03bdi ,cont is the continuum flux and EWi is the equivalent width of the ith line.\nFor pure coherent scattering, Schuster's law (eq.[20]) and\nthe definition of the equivalent width (eq.[23]) gives\nZ\ntot\n\u03c40,i\n\u03c6\u03bd,i\n\u221a\nd\u03bd,\n(28)\nEWi =\ntot \u03c6\n2/ 3 + \u03c40,i\n\u03bd,i\ntot\nwhere \u03c40,i\nand \u03c6\u03bd,i is the normalization of the optical\ndepth and line profile distribution of the ith line respectively. We find an extremely simple form for equation\n(28) by taking the asymptotic form3 of the Holtsmark\n\u22122.5\ndistribution \u03c6\u03bd \u2248 0.75 (|\u03bd \u2212 \u03bd0 |/\u2206\u03bdStark )\n. Assuming\ntot\n\u03c40 is large, we break up the integral in equation (28)\n\u221a\ninto a regime where \u03c40tot \u03c6\u03bd is large compared to 2/\u221a 3\nand a regime where \u03c40tot \u03c6\u03bd is small compared to 2/ 3.\nThus, we get\n\u0014Z \u03b70\n\u0015\nZ \u221e\n0.75\u03b7 \u22122.5\nd\u03b7\ntot\n\u221a d\u03b7 ,\n+\nEWi \u2248 2\u03c40,i \u2206\u03bdStark\n\u03c40tot\n2/ 3\n\u03b70\n0\n\u0001\ntot 0.4\n(29)\n\u2248 2.8\u2206\u03bdStark \u03c40,i\n\u221a\nwhere \u03b7 = |\u03bd \u2212 \u03bd0 |/\u2206\u03bdStark and 0.75\u03c40tot \u03b70\u22122.5 = 2/ 3.\nWe extend this simple form for the EW to handle fine\nstructure splitting if the split lines are widely separated\nand therefore distinct. We sum over each split line to get\n\u0001 X 0.4\ntot 0.4\nsi,j ,\n(30)\nEWi \u2248 2.8\u2206\u03bdStark \u03c40,i\nj\n\nwhere si,j are the relative strength of each split\nline for the ith transition.\nFor Ly\u03b1, which is\nsplit into two lines with a ratio of 2:1, we find\n\u00010.4\ntot\n.\nSimilarly for\nEWLy\u03b1 = 4.2\u2206\u03bdStark, Ly\u03b1 \u03c40,Ly\u03b1\nH\u03b1 with a line strength ratio of 9:1:5, EWH\u03b1 =\n\u00010.4\ntot\n.\n5.2\u2206\u03bdStark, H\u03b1 \u03c40,H\u03b1\nFollowing our previous discussion, we now equate the\nradiative force (eq.[27]) to the effective force to find the\nequilibrium column. For simplicity, let us first consider\nonly the Ly\u03b1 line and a radiation field that is isotropic\nin the outer half hemisphere. We find\n\u0012\n\u00135/3\ng\n20\nNFe,tot \u2248 5 \u00d7 10\n\u03be \u22122/3 cm\u22122 ,\n3 \u00d7 1014 cm s\u22122\n(31)\nfor kT \u2248 2 keV, where \u03be \u2261 NFe,tot /NFe,n=1 is the ratio of\ntotal Fe column to ground state hydrogenic Fe column.\nThe Ly\u03b1 equivalent width that is associated with this Fe\ncolumn is\n\u00132/3\n\u0012\ng\nEWLy\u03b1 \u2248 400\n\u03be \u22122/3 eV. (32)\n3 \u00d7 1014 cm s\u22122\nRadiative levitation can easily sustain an atmosphere\nwhose metallicity can be supersolar. In Saha equilibrium,\nthe ratio between fully ionized Fe and the n=1 hydrogenic state is 10-20 and NFe, tot = 7 \u2212 12 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22123 ,\nlarger than a constant solar metallicity atmosphere\n\u22122.5\n3 The standard definition is \u03c6 \u2248 1.5 (|\u03bd \u2212 \u03bd |/\u2206\u03bd\nfor\n\u03bd\n0\nStark )\nlarge (|\u03bd \u2212 \u03bd0 |/\u2206\u03bdStark ). The numerical prefactor of 0.75 comes\nfrom the fact that the line is symmetric and hence the distribution\nruns from \u2212\u221e to \u221e and not from 0 to \u221e\n\n\fNeutron Star Line Transport\nNFe \u2248 5 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 (BCP). These values are also tantalizingly close to what would be required to for the measured H\u03b1 line, but we note that the radiatively levitated\nFe column is sensitively dependent on the background\ncontinuum and surface gravity. Since bursting NS atmospheres are expected to be harder than a blackbody as\ndiscussed earlier in \u00a7 2, we would expect these values to\nbe lower limits. The associated Ly\u03b1 EW for these Fe\ncolumns in this approximation is 50-90 eV.\nOther transitions also contribute to the radiative force\non the Fe column. We now show that their contributions\nare small compared to the Ly\u03b1 radiative force. First, we\nconsider the contribution from the H\u03b1 transition. For a\nBoltzmann distribution between the n=1 and the n=2\nstate at kT = 2 keV, the column density in the n=2\nstate is NFe,n=2 = 0.1NFe,n=1. The radiative force from\nthe H\u03b1 transition is Frad,H\u03b1 \u2248 2 \u00d7 1012 g cm s\u22122 which is\na factor of 5 smaller than the radiative force on the Ly\u03b1\ntransition of Frad,Ly\u03b1 \u2248 1013 g cm s\u22122 . The contribution\nfrom the H\u03b1 transition increases the column by about a\nthird, but we will ignore this contribution in keeping with\nthe order of magnitude spirit of this calculation. Other\ntransitions also contribute, but their radiative forces are\nweaker as their fluxes are weaker by the Rayleigh-Jeans\nfactor of \u03bd 2 compared to H\u03b1.\n4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nMotivated by the accretion/spallation scenario that\nwe first presented in BCP, we have calculated the resonant radiative transfer of a thin scattering layer above\nthe NS photosphere. While our calculation and microphysics are geared toward understanding the feature as\nan Fe H\u03b1 line, the basic physics would remain the same\nfor other atomic transitions. Namely, if the line is produced near the continuum photosphere where the densities are relatively high, Stark broadening is dominant,\nNLTE effects are prevalent and the line is a result of\nresonant scattering. Applied to Fe H\u03b1, our calculations\nshow that the EW of the Fe H\u03b1 line observed by CPM\nfrom EXO 0748-676 requires an Fe column 3-10 times\nlarger than the accretion/spallation scenario predicts for\naccretion of solar metallicity material (BCP). We also\napproximate a uniform solar metallicity atmosphere by\nassuming the Fe sits at a larger depth. In this case, we\nfind that the required column of Fe is within a factor of\n3 of a solar metallicity atmosphere over a large range of\ntemperatures.\nThe fact that the H\u03b1 line is narrow requires that the\nrotation rate of EXO 0748-676 is slow. Larger spin rates,\nassuming a neutron star radius of around 10 km, would\nwash out such a line unless the surface emission is confined to a narrow region around the spin axis (Bhattacharyya, Miller & Lamb 2004). A slow rotation rate\nfor EXO 0748-676 is consistent with the recently measured 44.7 Hz burst oscillation (Villarreal & Strohmayer\n2004). With these line profiles in hand and assuming\nthat the burst oscillation of 44.7 Hz is the rotation rate\nof the NS, detailed fits to the data raises the exciting\nprospect of fitting for the neutron star radius (Morsink\net al. 2005).\nSince the fine structure splitting of Fe H\u03b1 is of order the\nsize of the rotational broadening, we cannot assume that\nthe line is narrow compared to the rotational broadening. Previous work (\u00d6zel & Psaltis 2003; Bhattacharyya,\n\n9\n\nMiller & Lamb 2004) has presumed that the intrinsic line\nprofile does not matter because rotational broadening is\ndominant. While true for NS rotating at 300-600 Hz, it\nis not the case for a Fe H\u03b1 line at 45 Hz for a 10 km NS.\nRotational broadening may be the largest effect, but it\nis by no means the dominant effect. Therefore, the intrinsic line profile must be known to apply the observed\nlines to the study of NS physics.\nWe also estimated that the Fe EWLy\u03b1 and EWP\u03b1 are\napproximately 15-20 eV and 3-7 eV respectively at the\nobserved EWH\u03b1 . We can extend this calculation to include other n=1 and n=2 transitions aside from Ly\u03b1 and\nH\u03b1. However, because of the greatly reduced oscillator\nstrengths, these lines are significantly weaker. For instance, we have modeled H\u03b2 EW to be < 2 eV. Rotational broadening makes a huge impact on the observability of the Fe Ly\u03b1 transition. While the spectral resolution of Chandra and Astro E2 is more than adequate\nto detect such a line, the Ly\u03b1 line will be shallow and\ndifficult to detect. We expect rotational broadening to\nbe a small effect for P\u03b1, however, the redshifted energy\nof the P\u03b1 transition of 330 eV would make it difficult\ndue to interstellar absorption.\nIn calculating these profiles of Stark broadened lines,\nwe have assumed a pure hydrogen atmosphere. However,\nthe Stark broadening scale given in equation (3) depends\non the background composition. Namely \u2206EStark \u221d\n(2A/(Z + 1))2/3 Z 1/3 . For solar composition, \u2206EStark\nis larger by 14%. This reduces the required NFe needed\nto reproduced the observed EW by 10%. For a pure He\natmosphere \u2206EStark is larger by a factor of 2.42, which\nreduces the required NFe to reproduce the observed EW\nby 60%. For an atmosphere that consist of equal parts\nHe and H by number, we find the required NFe is reduced\nby about 50%. Such He-rich atmosphere would demand\naccretion from a H-poor donor such as 4U 1820-30, but\nthe initial spallation would reduce the He fraction at the\nphotosphere.\nThe formation of the He-like Fe spectral feature in the\nlow-temperature part of the burst is an issue that warrants further study. In Saha equilibrium, H-like Fe transitions to He-like Fe at 1.2 keV (CPM). We note however\nthat the microphysics of this line is significantly different from the H\u03b1 line. Its instrinsic broadening is due to\nthermal Doppler effects because the lack of degenerate\nopposite parity states suppresses the linear Stark effect\n(Bethe & Salpeter 1957). Modeling this feature requires\na separate calculation which is beyond the scope of this\npaper.\nIf accretion/spallation is indeed not the endpoint of\naccretion onto a neutron star, we expand on radiative\nlevitation as a means to suspend the Fe, which we first\npointed out in BCP. We give a simple estimate for the Fe\ncolumn that could be suspended by radiative levitation.\nWe find that radiative levitation could suspend a column\nof Fe needed to produce the line. However, this result depends sensitively on the exact nature of the background\nspectra. Further work will be necessary as the continuum spectra could be much harder than the blackbody\nbackground that we have assumed.\nThough we assume solar metallicity throughout our\ncalculations, the composition of the accreting material\nremains highly uncertain. If the metallicity of the flow is\n\n\f10\n\nChang, Bildsten & Wasserman\n\nsufficiently supersolar, the disparity between the accretion/spallation Fe column and that implied from observation can be resolved. However, the contrast between\nthe deep dips and the unobscured state of EXO 0748-676\nindicates that the metallicity may be subsolar by a factor\nof 2-7 (Parmar et al. 1986). More recent work has found\nthat the abundance ratios of Mg, Ne and O are consistent with solar with large uncertainties (Jimenez-Garate,\nSchulz & Marshall 2003). The intrinsic metallicity of the\nflow remains largely uncertain.\nWe thank the anonymous referee and Deepto\nChakrabarty for a careful reading of our manuscript.\nTheir comments greatly clarified this work. We thank\n\nR. Sunyaev for detailed discussions and for highlighting\nthe importance of the fine structure splitting for high\nZ elements. We thank S. W. Davis for discussions on\nnumerical solutions to radiative transfer problems.
