The resulting\nconstrained UHF (CUHF) wave function is identical to that obtained from Roothaan's effective Fock\noperator. Our \u03b1 and \u03b2 CUHF Fock operators are parameter-free and have canonical orbitals and orbital energies that are physically meaningful as in UHF, except for eliminating spin contamination.\nThe present approach removes ambiguities in ROHF orbital energies and the non-uniqueness of\nmethods that build upon them. We present benchmarks to demonstrate CUHF physical correctness\nand good agreement with experimental results.\n\nRestricted open-shell Hartree-Fock (ROHF) theory\nwas formulated by Roothaan some 50 years ago.1 A major drawback of this model is the lack of a unique effective Fock operator.2 Even though the ROHF wave function and total energy obtained from different coupling\nschemes are the same, the resulting orbitals and orbital\nenergies are different and lead to post-ROHF results that\ngenerally depend on them. The interpretation and physical picture emerging from Roothaan's open-shell theory\nhave always been somewhat blurry. Attempts to resolve\nthese ambiguities, as well as many paradoxes resulting\nfrom them, are well documented in the literature.3\u20136\nOn the other hand, the physical picture of unrestricted\nHF (UHF) is clear.7 It is a single-determinant wave function with well-defined \u03b1 and \u03b2 orbital energies obeying\nKoopmans' theorem. It is straightforward to use it in\npost-UHF calculations by simply treating the \u03b1 and \u03b2 orbitals explicitly and separately. The notorious problem in\nUHF, however, is spin contamination: the wave function\nis not an eigenfunction of S 2 . This weakness is ubiquitous and a serious detriment when bonds are stretched. If\nthe UHF wave function suffers from severe spin contamination, as is the case when strong static correlation is\npresent, then UHF is no longer a good starting reference\npoint for post-UHF treatments of correlation or excited\nstates. Once lost, good quantum numbers are hard to\nrecover,8 so when possible, it is preferrable to use ROHF\nas a starting point despite the ambiguities regarding its\nassociated Fock operator.\nIn recent work, we have developed a novel theory for\ntreating strong correlations within an independent quasiparticle picture.9\u201312 As a spin off of this work,12 we have\nrealized that the UHF energy can be written as a functional of the charge density matrix P = (\u03b3 \u03b1 + \u03b3 \u03b2 )/2\nand the spin density matrix M = (\u03b3 \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b3 \u03b2 )/2, where\n\u03b3 \u03b1 and \u03b3 \u03b2 are the \u03b1 and \u03b2 density matrices, respectively. Our proposed Constrained-Pairing Mean-Field\nTheory (CPMFT) departs from UHF by adopting a different definition for M, a choice inspired by an underlying quasiparticle correlation picture. With this choice,\nCPMFT can accurately and efficiently describe static\ncorrelation and dissociate any molecule to fragments with\nROHF energies, keeping the correct hS 2 i all along the\n\ndissociation path.10 The connections between CPMFT,\nROHF, and UHF turn out to be enlightening for formulating ROHF as a constrained UHF theory. The resulting CUHF scheme here presented leads to well-defined \u03b1\nand \u03b2 Fock operators with straightforward interpretation\nand no spin contamination. The ROHF wavefunction,\nenergy, charge and spin densities remain the same; only\nthe ROHF Fock operator is replaced by two UHF-like\ncounterparts. As shown in benchmarks below, the meaning of the resulting orbitals and orbital energies is much\nmore physical than in Roothaan's approach and provide\na base for treatments of electron correlation and excited\nstates.\nTheory. The familiar energy expression in ROHF is\nX\nX\nfi fj (2aji hij|iji\u2212bji hij|jii), (1)\nfi hii +\nEROHF = 2\nij\n\ni\n\nwhere hij are one-electron integrals, hij|kli are twoelectron integrals in Dirac's notation, a and b are the\ncoupling coefficients, and fi are the orbital occupations:\n1 for core (doubly-occupied, c) and 0 for virtual (unoccupied, v) orbitals. In the case of high-spin open-shell\nsystems under consideration, a = 1, b = 2, and f = 1/2\nfor open-shells orbitals (singly-occupied, o). Roothaan's\neffective Fock operator is defined as\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nRcc F\u03b2co Fcs\ncore (c)\ncv\n\uf8f8\nopen\n(o)\nFROHF = \uf8ed F\u03b2oc Roo F\u03b1\n(2)\nov\n\u03b1\nvirtual\n(v)\nFcs\nF\nR\nvv\nvc\nvo\nwhere F\u03b1 and F\u03b2 are UHF \u03b1 and \u03b2 Fock matrices, and\nFcs = (F\u03b1 +F\u03b2 )/2. At self-consistent field (SCF) convergence, all off-diagonal FROHF terms become zero. The\nchoice of the diagonal elements in Eq.(2) is completely\narbitrary within a set of A and B coupling parameters:\n\u03b2\nRcc = Acc F\u03b1\ncc + Bcc Fcc\n\nRoo =\nRvv =\n\n\u03b2\nAoo F\u03b1\noo + Boo Foo\n\u03b2\nAvv F\u03b1\nvv + Bvv Fvv .\n\n(3a)\n(3b)\n(3c)\n\nDifferent values for these parameters have been suggested\nin the literature.2 Although they do not affect the ROHF\nwave function and energy, they affect orbital energies\n\n\f2\nwhose physical meaning is obscured because of this dependence. Choices guided to determine \"canonical\" sets\nthat satisfy Koopmans' theorem may result in violations\nto the aufbau principle.4,6 In this paper, these problems\nare resolved by abandoning the use of a single Fock operator. We will obtain the ROHF wave function by projecting the UHF wave function self-consistently. Spin\ncontamination in UHF is given by12\n\u03b4s = hS 2 i \u2212 Sz (Sz + 1) = N\u03b2 \u2212 Tr(\u03b3 \u03b1 \u03b3 \u03b2 )\n\nTr(\u03b3 \u03b1 \u03b3 \u03b2 ) =\n\nNe\n\u2212 2 TrM2 .\n2\n\n(9)\n\nConsidering Eqs.(7) and (8), it is evident that\n\n(4)\n\nwhere Sz = (N\u03b1 \u2212 N\u03b2 )/2 and N\u03c3 (\u03c3 = \u03b1, \u03b2) is the number of \u03c3 electrons in the system. The previously proposed\nspin-constrained UHF (SUHF) approach13 introduces a\nLagrange multiplier \u03bb in UHF to enforce \u03b4s = 0. However, this is exact only in the limit of \u03bb \u2192 \u221e. In this\nlimit, the effective SUHF Fock matrices remain in the\nform of Eq.(2).14 We here propose an alternative method\nbased on restricting natural occupations and spin density\neigenvalues via finite Lagrange multipliers.\nIn UHF, the natural occupations n are eigenvalues of\nP; they can be 0, 1, 21 , or appear in \"corresponding pairs\"\n(n, 1\u2212n).15 This is a rigorous mathematical result following from P being the half sum of two idempotent density\nmatrices.16 In high-spin systems, the number of 12 occupations is N\u03b1 \u2212 N\u03b2 = Ns (we assume N\u03b1 > N\u03b2 always).\nNote that TrP = (N\u03b1 + N\u03b2 )/2 = Ne /2, where Ne is the\nnumber of electrons. For clarity, we discuss below only\nthe case where the number of orbitals N is greater than\nNe but our results hold for N \u2264 Ne too.

The identity matrix in \u03b3 \u03b1 accounts\nfor unpaired electrons, traces to Ns , and is substituted by\na corresponding zero matrix in \u03b3 \u03b2 . The other zero matrix\nhas dimension Nv = N \u2212 Ns \u2212 2Ncp and corresponds to\nvirtual (n = 0) unpaired orbitals.

The full spectrum of M also includes 21 and 0 eigenvalues, thus tracing\nto Ns /2. Using the idempotency of \u03b3 \u03b1 and \u03b3 \u03b2 , we get\n\nTrM2 = 2\n\nNcp\nX\n\nm2i +\n\ni\n\nNs\n,\n4\n\n(10)\n\nand hence\n\u03b4s = N\u03b2 \u2212 Tr(\u03b3 \u03b1 \u03b3 \u03b2 ) = 4\n\nNcp\nX\n\nm2i .\n\n(11)\n\ni\n\nThis readily means that to eliminate spin contamination\nin UHF all mi should be zero. Therefore, we propose\nto formulate ROHF as a constrained UHF scheme that\nenforces all mi to be zero. From Eq.(6), mi = 0 implies\nthat corresponding pair occupations become constrained\nto values of 1 and 0, thus effectively creating core (c) and\nvirtual (v) orbital blocks. To enforce these constraints,\nwe introduce Lagrange multipliers \u03bbij and then write in\na general basis\nECUHF = EUHF +\n\nX\u2032\n\n\u03bbij Mij ,\n\n(12)\n\nij\n\nwhere the prime on the summation restricts it to cv and\nvc blocks.

These Fock matrices eliminate ambiguities\narising in ROHF theory and produce a more physical\nUHF-like picture.

However, unlike UHF, they\nhave no spin contamination, which is removed by Lagrangian constraints. Their eigenvalues \u03b5\u03c3i are physical\norbital energies in the sense that they are associated with\nindividual \u03b1 and \u03b2 orbitals, satisfy Koopmans' theorem,\nand the aufbau principle,17 as opposed to many ROHF\ncanonicalizations of Eq.(2).6 Our orbitals have previously\nbeen proposed in the literature as semi-canonical orbitals\nfor MP2 and used in an ad hoc fashion.18 Our present\nwork shows that the Fock matrices for which these orbitals are eigenfunctions appear from a constrained UHF\noptimization that eliminates spin contamination.\nResults. We have implemented CUHF in the Gaussian\nsuite of programs19 and verified that our procedure\nconverges to the ROHF energy. Unlike many ROHF\nschemes, CUHF has no issues with SCF convergence.\nThis is undoubtedly related to the observance of the\naufbau principle in our method. Since Koopmans'\ntheorem is valid for CUHF, orbital energies approximate ionization potentials (IP) and electron affinities\n(EA). In Table I we summarize the mean (ME) and\nmean absolute errors (MAE) of first IPs estimated via\nHOMO energies (\u03b5HOMO ) for 24 open-shell compounds\nselected from the G2 set.20 Molecular geometries are\noptimized with B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p). CUHF results\nwith a 6-311++G(3df,3pd) basis are compared to UHF\nand the default (McWeeny) ROHF implementation21 in\nGaussian. In all systems, the CUHF \u03b5HOMO captures the\nright physics yielding IPs comparable to those of UHF yet\npreserving the correct hS 2 i expectation value.22\nWe have compared our CUHF orbital energies with\nthose obtained by Eq.(2) with parameters recently suggested by Plakhutin, Gorelik, and Breslavskaya (PGB).2\n\n\f4\nTABLE III: TDHF valence (V) and Rydberg (R) excitation\nenergies (in eV) of open-shell molecules.

However, the PGB scheme usually violates the aufbau principle resulting in poor SCF convergence. Therefore, as a simple remedy, we have used\nthe converged ROHF wave function and then diagonalized Eq.(2) with PGB parameters in a single shot. The\neigenvalues thus obtained are identical to those from the\nself-consistent PGB scheme.\nFor the systems in Table I, PGB gives the same first\nIP as CUHF, except for HCO whose \u03b5HOMO are \u221210.88\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\nC.

The PGB scheme produces\nCUHF \u03b1 virtual and \u03b2 core orbital energies by construction. However, the overall spectrum is appreciably different. In Table II, we present valence orbital energies for\nCN. In standard ROHF, 5\u03c3 is predicted to be the openshell orbital. Note the aufbau violation in PGB as previously reported.6 Results in Table II indicate that CUHF\ncan well describe both \u03b1 electron detachment and \u03b2 electron attachment processes, yielding a spectrum that is\nfully interpretable.\nLast, we present excitation energies of five small\nopen-shell molecules calculated with time-dependent\nHF (TDHF) based on UHF and CUHF with a 6311++G(3df,3pd) basis. The bond-lengths for BeF and\nCO+ (not included in the G2 set) are 1.355 and 1.078\n\u00c5, respectively. For TD-CUHF, we have used CUHF orbitals and orbital energies in the TD-UHF procedure.\nAlthough this TD-CUHF scheme is not rigorous (one\nshould perturb F\u0303, compute the response of P and include\nterms arising from \u03bb), this simple approximation turns\nout to be quite reasonable as shown in Table III. When\nUHF spin contamination (\u03b4s ) is small, TD-UHF and TDCUHF give very similar results. As \u03b4s becomes larger,\nhowever, TD-UHF greatly overestimates the excitation\nenergies. On the other hand, by retaining a spin projected reference (\u03b4s = 0), TD-CUHF gives more reasonable excitation energies outperforming TD-UHF in spin\ncontaminated situations.\nThis work was supported by NSF(CHE-0807194) and\nthe Welch Foundation (C-0036).
