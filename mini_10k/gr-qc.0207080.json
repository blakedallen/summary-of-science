Over the past three years, properties of isolated horizons were studied in detail. In particular, the framework enabled one to extend the laws of\nblack hole mechanics [2, 3] and has been used to extract\nphysics from initial data of widely separated black holes\n[4] and from numerical simulations of the final phases of\nblack hole collisions [1, 5]. The purpose of this letter is\nto outline a generalization of these ideas to fully dynamical situations in which matter and gravitational radiation\ncan fall into black holes.\nOur definition of a dynamical horizon is geared to practical applications in astrophysical situations, particularly\nthose considered in numerical relativity.\n\nI.\n\nDEFINITION AND NOTATION\n\nDefinition: A smooth, three-dimensional, space-like\nsub-manifold H in a space-time is said to be a dynamical\nhorizon if it is foliated by a preferred family of 2-spheres\nsuch that, on each leaf S, the expansion \u03b8(l) of a null\nnormal la vanishes and the expansion \u03b8(n) of the other\nnull normal na is strictly negative.\nThus, a dynamical horizon H is a 3-manifold which\nis foliated by marginally trapped 2-spheres. As shown\nbelow, the area of these 2-spheres necessarily increases.\nAn example is provided by continuous segments of world\ntubes of apparent horizons that naturally arise in numerical evolutions of black holes. In contrast to event horizons, dynamical horizons can be located quasi-locally;\nknowledge of the full space-time is not required. The\ncondition that H be space-like is implied by a stronger\nbut physically reasonable restriction that the derivative\nof \u03b8(l) along na be negative [6]. Finally, the requirement\nthat the leaves be topologically S 2 can be replaced by\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: ashtekar@gravity.psu.edu\naddress: Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Gravitationsphysik,\nAlbert-Einstein-Institut, Am M\u00fchlenberg 1, D-14476 Golm, Germany; Electronic address: badkri@aei-potsdam.mpg.de\n\n\u2020 Present\n\nthe weaker condition that they be compact. One can\nshow that the topology of S is necessarily S 2 if the flux\nof matter or gravitational energy across H is non-zero. If\nthese fluxes were to vanish identically, H would become\nisolated and replaced by a null, non-expanding horizon\n[2].\nDynamical horizons are closely related to Hayward's\ntrapping horizons [6]. However, while the definition of\ntrapping horizons imposes a condition on the derivative\nof \u03b8(l) off H, our conditions refer only to geometric quantities which are intrinsically defined on H. But in cases of\nphysical interest, the additional condition would be satisfied and dynamical horizons will be future, outer trapping\nhorizons. Nonetheless, our analysis and results differ considerably from those of Hayward's. While his framework\nis based on a 2+2 decomposition, ours will be based on\nthe ADM 3+1 decomposition. Our discussion includes\nangular momentum, our flux formulae are new and our\ngeneralization of black hole mechanics is different. Our\nanalysis is geared to providing tools to extract physics\nand perform checks on numerical simulations of dynamical black holes. Therefore we will restrict ourselves to\ndynamical horizons with zero charge.\nLet us begin by fixing notation. Let \u03c4ba be the unit\ntime-like normal to H and denote by \u2207a the space-time\nderivative operator. The metric and extrinsic curvature\nof H are denoted by qab and Kab := qa c qb d \u2207c \u03c4bd respectively; Da is the derivative operator on H compatible\nwith qab and Rab its Ricci tensor. Leaves of the preferred\nfoliation of H will be called cross-sections of H. The unit\nspace-like vector orthogonal to S and tangent to H is denoted by rb a . Quantities intrinsic to S will be generally\nwritten with a tilde. Thus, the two-metric on S is qeab , the\ne ab := qe c qe d Dc rbd , the\nextrinsic curvature of S \u2282 H is K\na b\ne a and its Ricci tensor\nderivative operator on (S, qeab ) is D\ne ab . Finally, we will fix the rescaling freedom in the\nis R\nchoice of null normals via la := \u03c4b a +b\nr a and na := \u03c4b a \u2212b\nr a.\nWe first note an immediate consequence of the definie > 0.\ntion. Since \u03b8(l) = 0 and \u03b8(n) < 0, it follows that K\nHence the area aS of S increases monotonically along rb a .\nThus the second law of black hole mechanics holds on H.\nWe will obtain an explicit expression for the change of\narea in part III.\n\n\f2\nOur main analysis is based on the fact that, since H\nis a space-like surface, the Cauchy data (qab , Kab ) on H\nmust satisfy the usual scalar and vector constraints\nHS := R + K 2 \u2212 K ab Kab = 16\u03c0GTab \u03c4b a \u03c4b b\n\u0001\nHVa := Db K ab \u2212 Kq ab = 8\u03c0GT bc \u03c4bc q a b .\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nWe will often focus our attention on a portion \u2206H \u2282 H\nwhich is bounded by two cross-sections S1 and S2 .\n\nII.\n\nANGULAR MOMENTUM\n\nThe angular momentum analysis is rather straight forward and is, in fact, applicable to an arbitrary space-like\nhypersurface. Fix any vector field \u03c6a on H which is tangential to the cross-sections of H. Contract \u03c6a with both\nsides of eqn. (2). Integrate the resulting equation over\nthe region \u2206H \u2282 H, perform an integration by parts and\nuse the identity L \u03c6 qab = 2D(a \u03c6b) to obtain\nI\n1\nKab \u03c6 rb d V \u2212\nKab \u03c6a rb b d2 V\n8\u03c0G S1\nS2\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nab\na b\n(3)\nP L \u03c6 qab d3 V\nTab \u03c4b \u03c6 +\n16\u03c0G\n\u2206H\n\n1\n8\u03c0G\nZ\n=\n\nI\n\na b\n\n2\n\nwhere P ab := K ab \u2212 Kq ab . It is natural to identify the\nsurface integrals with the generalized angular momentum\nJ (\u03c6) associated with those surfaces and set:\nI\n1\n(\u03c6)\nJS = \u2212\nKab \u03c6a rb b d2 V\n(4)\n8\u03c0G S\n\nwhere we have chosen the overall sign to ensure compatibility with conventions normally used in the asymptotically flat context. The term 'generalized' emphasizes the\nfact that the vector field \u03c6a need not be an axial Killing\nfield even on S; it only has to be tangential to our crosssections.\nThe flux of this angular momentum due to matter\nfields and gravitational waves are respectively\nZ\nTab \u03c4b a \u03c6b d3 V ,\n(5)\nJm(\u03c6) = \u2212\n\u2206H\nZ\n1\nJg(\u03c6) = \u2212\nP ab L \u03c6 qab d3 V ,\n(6)\n16\u03c0G \u2206H\n\nand we get the balance equation\n(\u03c6)\n\nJ2\n\n(\u03c6)\n\n\u2212 J1\n\n= Jm(\u03c6) + Jg(\u03c6) .\n\n(7)\n\nAs expected, if \u03c6a is a Killing vector of the three-metric\n(\u03c6)\nqab , then the gravitational flux vanishes: Jg\n= 0.\nIt is convenient to introduce the angular momentum\n(\u03c6)\ncurrent jH\u03c6 := \u2212Kab \u03c6a rb b so that (4) becomes JS =\n\u03c6 2\n\u22121\nj d V.\n(8\u03c0G)\nS\n\nIII.\n\nENERGY FLUXES AND AREA BALANCE\n\nAs is usual in general relativity, the notion of energy is\ntied to a choice of a vector field. Here, we will consider\nvector fields \u03be a = N la where the lapse N is constructed\nas follows. Let r be a radial coordinate on H defined such\nthat the cross-sections of H are level surfaces of r. Then\nrba \u221d Da r. It turns out that in order to get the balance\nlaw for energy, we must tie our lapse functions N to radial\ncoordinates such that Da r = Nr rba . (Since \u03be a = N la ,\nas usual the term 'lapse' refers to space-time evolution;\nnot to 'evolution' along r\u0302a .) Thus each r determines a\npermissible lapse function Nr . If we use a different radial\ncoordinate r\u2032 , then the lapse is rescaled according to the\nrelation\nNr \u2032 = Nr\n\ndr\u2032\n.\ndr\n\n(8)\n\nThus, although the lapse itself will in general be a function of all three coordinates on H, the relative factor between any two permissible lapses can be a function only\nof r. We denote the resulting permissible vector fields by\na\n\u03be(r)\n:= Nr la . Recall that, on an isolated horizon, physical fields are time independent and null normals can be\nrescaled by a positive constant [2]. Now the horizon fields\nare 'dynamical', i.e., r-dependent, and the rescaling freedom is by a positive function of r.\nWe are interested in calculating the flux of energy\na\nassociated with \u03be(r)\nfor any radial coordinate r. De(r)\n\nnote\nthe flux of matter energy across \u2206H by Fm :=\nR\nb\nT\nb a \u03be(r)\nd3 V . By taking the appropriate combina\u2206H ab \u03c4\ntion of (1) and (2) we obtain\nZ\n1\n(r)\nNr {HS + 2b\nra HVa } d3 V .\n(9)\n=\nFm\n16\u03c0G \u2206H\nSince H is foliated by two-spheres, we can perform a 2+1\nsplit of the various quantities on H. Using the Gauss\nCodazzi relation we rewrite R in terms of quantities on\nS:\ne ab + 2Da \u03b1a\ne+K\ne2 \u2212 K\ne ab K\nR=R\n\n(10)\n\ne = Kab rb a rb b .\nK +K\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03b1a = rb b Db rb a \u2212 rb a Db rb b . Next, the fact that the\nexpansion \u03b8(l) of la vanishes leads to the relation\n\nUsing (10) and (11) in eqn. (9) and simplifying, we obtain\nthe result\nZ\nZ\nb\ne d3 V = 16\u03c0G\nTab \u03c4b a \u03be(r)\nd3 V\nNr R\n\u2206H\n\u2206H\nZ\n\b\nNr |\u03c3|2 + 2|\u03b6|2 d3 V (12)\n+\n\u2206H\n\nwhere |\u03c3|2 = \u03c3ab \u03c3 ab with \u03c3ab := qeac qeb d \u2207c ld \u2212\n1\neab qe cd \u2207c ld , the shear of la , and |\u03b6|2 = \u03b6 a \u03b6a with\n2q\n\n\f3\n\u03b6 a := qeab rb c \u2207c lb . Both \u03c3ab and \u03b6 a are tensors intrinsic to S. To simplify the left side of this equation, note\nthat the volume element d3 V on H can be written as\nd3 V = Nr\u22121 dr d2 V where d2 V is the area element on S.\ne\nUsing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, the integral of Nr R\ncan then be written as\n\u0013\nZ r2 \u0012I\nZ\n3\n2\ne\ne\ndr\nNr R d V =\nR d V = 8\u03c0(r2 \u2212 r1 ) .\n\u2206H\n\nr1\n\nS\n\n(13)\nSubstituting this result in eqn. (12) we finally obtain\nZ\n\u0010r\nr1 \u0011\n2\nb\nd3 V\nTab \u03c4b a \u03be(r)\n=\n\u2212\n2G 2G\n\u2206H\nZ\n\b\n1\n+\nNr |\u03c3|2 + 2|\u03b6|2 d3 V. (14)\n16\u03c0G \u2206H\n\nThis is the key result we were looking for. Let us now\ninterpret the various terms appearing in this equation.\nThe first integral on the right side of this equation is\n(r)\nthe flux Fm of matter energy associated with the vector\na\na\nfield \u03be(r) . Since \u03be(r)\nis null and \u03c4b time-like, if Tab satisfies, say, the dominant energy condition, this quantity\nis guaranteed to be non-negative. It is natural to inter(r)\na\npret the second term as the flux Fg of \u03be(r)\n-energy in the\ngravitational radiation:\nZ\n\b\n1\nFg(r) :=\n(15)\nNr |\u03c3|2 + 2|\u03b6|2 d3 V .\n16\u03c0G \u2206H\nThis expression shares four desirable features with the\nBondi-Sachs energy flux at null infinity. First, it does\nnot refer to any coordinates or tetrads; it refers only to\nthe given dynamical horizon H and the evolution veca\ntor field \u03be(r)\n. Second, the energy flux is manifestly nonnegative. Third, all fields used in it are local; we did not\nhave to perform, e.g., a radial integration to define any\nof them. Finally, the expression vanishes in the spherically symmetric case: if the Cauchy data (qab , Kab ) and\nthe foliation on H is spherically symmetric, \u03c3ab = 0 and\n\u03b6 a = 0.\nTo conclude this section, let us\np choose for our radial\ncoordinate the area radius R := a/4\u03c0. Then,\nR1\nR2\n(R)\n\u2212\n= Fm\n+ Fg(R)\n2G 2G\n\n(16)\n\nThus, as promised in part I, we have obtained an explicit\nformula relating the change in the area of the horizon to\nfluxes of matter and gravitational \u03be(R) -energy.\nIV.\n\nit, we can assume that, because of the influx of matter\nand gravitational energy, E \u03be(R) will change by an amount\n(R)\n(R)\n\u2206 E \u03be(R) = Fm +Fg as we move from one cross section\nto another. Therefore, if we define effective surface grava\nity kR associated with \u03be(R)\nas kR := 1/2R, the infinitesimal form of (16) implies (kR /8\u03c0G)da = dE \u03be(R) . For a\ngeneral choice of the radial coordinate r, (14) yields a\ngeneralized first law:\n\nMASS AND THE FIRST LAW\n\nLet us now combine the results of parts II and III to\nobtain the physical process version of the first law for H\nand a mass formula for an arbitrary cross-section of H.\nDenote by E \u03be(R) the \u03be(R) -energy of cross-sections S of\nH. While we do not yet have the explicit expression for\n\nkr\nda = dE \u03be(r)\n8\u03c0G\n\n(17)\n\na\nwhere the effective surface gravity kr of \u03be(R)\nis given by\n\nkr =\n\ndr\nkR\ndR\n\nwhere\n\na\n=\n\u03be(r)\n\ndr a\n\u03be .\ndR (R)\n\n(18)\n\nThis rescaling freedom in surface gravity is analogous to\nthe rescaling freedom which exists for Killing horizons,\nor more generally, isolated horizons. The new feature in\nthe present case is that we have the freedom to rescale\nthe surface gravity (and la ) by a positive function of the\nradius instead of just by a constant. This is just what\none would expect in a dynamical situation. Finally, note\nthat the differentials appearing in (17) are actual variations along the dynamical horizon due to an infinitesimal\nchange in r and are not variations in phase space as in\nsome of the formulations [2, 3, 7] of the first law.\nTo include rotation, pick a vector field \u03c6a on H such\nthat \u03c6a is tangent to the cross-sections of H, has closed\norbits and has affine length 2\u03c0.( At this point, \u03c6a need\nnot be a Killing vector of qab .) Consider time evolution\nvector fields ta which are of the form ta = Nr la \u2212 \u03a9\u03c6a\nwhere Nr is a permissible lapse associated with a radial\ncoordinate r Rand \u03a9 an arbitrary function of r. Evaluate\nthe quantity \u2206H Tab \u03c4b a tb d3 V using (3) and (14):\n\u001aI\nI\nr2 \u2212 r1\n1\n\u03c6 2\n\u03a9j \u03c6 d2 V\n\u03a9j d V \u2212\n+\n2G\n8\u03c0G S2\nS1\n\u001b Z\nI\nZ \u03a92\nTab \u03c4b a tb d3 V\nd\u03a9 j \u03c6 d2 V =\n\u2212\n\u2206H\nS\n\u03a91\nZ\n\u0001\n1\n2\n+\nNr |\u03c3| + 2|\u03b6|2 d3 V\n16\u03c0G \u2206H\nZ\n1\n\u03a9P ab L \u03c6 qab d3 V .\n(19)\n\u2212\n16\u03c0G \u2206H\nAgain, if we denote by E t the t-energy associated with\ncross-sections S of H, the right side of (19) can be interpreted as \u2206E t . If we now restrict ourselves to infinitesimal \u2206H, the three terms in the curly brackets combine\nto give d(\u03a9J) \u2212 Jd\u03a9 and we obtain\ndr\nkr\n+ \u03a9dJ =\nda + \u03a9dJ = dE t .\n2G\n8\u03c0G\n\n(20)\n\nThis equation is our generalization of the first law for dynamical horizons. Since the differentials in this equation\nare variations along H, this can be viewed as a 'physical process version of the first law'. Note that for each\n\n\f4\nallowed choice of lapse Nr , angular velocity \u03a9(r) and vector field \u03c6a on H, we obtain a permissible time evolution\nvector field ta = Nr la \u2212 \u03a9\u03c6a and a corresponding first\nlaw. This situation is very similar to what happens in the\nisolated horizon framework where we obtain a first law for\neach permissible time translation on the horizon. Again,\nthe generalization from that time independent situation\nconsists of allowing the lapse and the angular velocity to\nbecome r-dependent, i.e., 'dynamical'.\nFor every allowed choice of (Nr , \u03a9(r), \u03c6a ), we can integrate eqn. (20) on H to obtain a formula for E t on any\ncross section but, in general, the result may not be expressible just in terms of geometric quantities defined locally on that cross-section. However, in some physically\ninteresting cases, the expression is local. For example,\nIn the case of spherical symmetry, it is natural to choose\n\u03a9 = 0 and R as the radial coordinate in which case we\nobtain E t = R/2G. This is just the irreducible (or Hawking) mass of the cross-section. Even in this simple case,\n(19) provides a useful balance law, with clear-cut interpretation. Physically, perhaps the most interesting case\nis the one in which qab is only axi-symmetric with \u03c6a\nas its axial Killing vector. In this case we can naturally\napply, at each cross-section S of H, the strategy used\nin the isolated horizon framework to select a preferred\nta : Calculate the angular momentum J defined by the\naxial Killing field \u03c6, choose the radial coordinate r (or\nequivalently, the lapse Nr ) such that\nkr = ko (R) :=\n\nR4 \u2212 4G2 J 2\n\u221a\n2R3 R4 + 4G2 J 2\n\n(21)\n\nand choose \u03a9 such that\n\u03a9 = \u03a9o (R) :=\n\n2GJ\n\u221a\n.\nR R4 + 4G2 J 2\n\n(22)\n\nThis functional dependence of kr on R and J is exactly\nthat of the Kerr family. (The condition on surface gravity\ncan always be implemented provided the right side of (21)\nis positive, which in the kerr family corresponds to nonextremal horizons. The resulting r and Nr are unique.)\nWith this choice of Nr and \u03a9, the energy ESt is given by\nthe well known Smarr formula\n\u221a\nko a\nR4 + 4G2 J 2\nto\nE = 2(\n+ \u03a9o J) =\n;\n(23)\n8\u03c0G\n2GR\n\n[1] A.

However, there is still a balance\n(t )\nequation in which the flux of gravitational energy Fg o is\nlocal and positive definite (see (19)). (The gravitational\nangular momentum flux which, in general, has indeterminate sign vanishes due to axi-symmetry.) Motivated\nby the isolated horizon framework, we will refer to this\ncanonical E to as the mass associated with cross-sections\nS of H and denote it simply by M . Thus, among the\ninfinitely many first laws (20), there is a canonical one:\n\nko\ndM =\nda + \u03a9o dJ .\n8\u03c0G\nWe conclude with three remarks.\n\n(24)\n\ni) Note that the mass and angular momentum depend\nonly on local fields on each cross section S and changes\nin these quantities over finite regions \u2206H of H have been\nrelated to matter and gravitational radiation fluxes, determined by the local geometry of H.\na\nii) Unlike the vector fields \u03be(r)\n= Nr la , general permisa\nsible vector fieldsR t is not necessarily causal. Therefore\nthe matter flux \u2206H Tab ta \u03c4b b d3 V need not be positive.\nSimilarly, if \u03c6a is not a Killing field of qab , the gravitational flux need not be positive. Therefore, although the\narea a always increase along r\u0302a , E t can decrease. This\nis the analog of the Penrose process in which 'rotational\nenergy' is extracted from the dynamical horizon.\n\niii) While the infinitesimal version eq (20) of the first\nlaw is conceptually more interesting, the finite balance\nequation (19) is likely to be more directly useful in the\nanalysis of astrophysical situations. In particular, the\npresence of an infinite number of these balance equations\ncan provide useful checks on numerical simulations in the\nstrong field regime.\nAcknowledgements We would like to thank Chris\nBeetle, Steve Fairhurst and Jerzy Lewandowski for stimulating discussions.
