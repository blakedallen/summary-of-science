These explicit solutions are based on the\ngeneral ansatz for such a type of backgrounds introduced by Gaiotto and Maldacena.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe gauge/string correspondence [1] has provided us with a fundamentally new way of investigating\nstrongly coupled phenomena. In its simplest formulation, it asserts that strongly coupled systems,\nsuch as four dimensional gauge theories, have a dual description as a string- or M-theory on a\ncurved spacetime. While it is not clear whether some form of the gauge/string correspondence\nwill eventually apply to all strongly coupled (field-theory) systems, large classes of dual theories\nhave been identified. The best-understood dual pairs involve d dimensional super-conformal field\ntheories (SCFTs), whose duals are described by string/M-theory on supersymmetric AdSd+1 \u00d7 X\nspacetimes where X is a Dc \u2212 d \u2212 1-dimensional manifold. 1\nFor each d there are maximally supersymmetric dual pairs such as the celebrated N = 4\nsuper-Yang-Mills (SYM) SU (N ) gauge theory and the dual Type IIB string theory on AdS5 \u00d7 S 5\nor the more recently found [2] super-Chern-Simons theory coupled to matter and its M-theory\ndual AdS4 \u00d7 (S 7 /Zk ). In these and related examples integrability techniques have provided a\nvery detailed understanding of anomalous dimensions of operators, or the spectrum of the dual\nstring theory, at all values (weak, strong and intermediate) of the gauge coupling. 2 These explicit\nexpressions for generic gauge theory quantities which are not protected by non-renormalisation\ntheorems should be taken as very strong evidence for the validity of the gauge/string duality for\nthese dual pairs. More importantly though, it gives one confidence that the gauge/string approach\ncaptures some of the underlying fundamental features of wider classes of strongly coupled systems.\nFor each d many dual pairs of theories with less than maximal supersymmetry are known. Less\nis known about such dual pairs than about the maximally supersymmetric pairs discussed in the\npreceding paragraph. Given the recent successes of the gauge/string correspondence in analysing\nthe maximally supersymmetric examples discussed above, it is likely that examples of dual pairs\nwith less supersymmetry will provide us with new insights into strongly coupled phenomena in\ngeneral. One physically interesting set of such examples are the spacetimes dual to generic N = 2\nfour-dimensional superconformal YM theories coupled to matter. Building on earlier work on\nsupersymmetric solutions with AdSm and/or S n factors [4], [5] and [6], Gaiotto and Maldacena [7]\n(GM) have constructed an M-theory spacetime ansatz dual to general N = 2 four-dimensional\nsuper-conformal field theories (SCFTs). The GM solutions are implicit: given a N = 2 SCFT of\nthe type discussed recently in the work of Gaiotto [8] one has to solve the three-dimensional Toda\nequation\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2202x21 + \u2202x22 D(x1 , x2 , y) + \u2202y2 eD(x1 ,x2 ,y) = 0 .\n(1.1)\nwith particular boundary conditions. General solutions of the Toda equation required for these\nspacetimes appear to be diffucult to find. As already observed in [5], much progress can be made\nwhen a U (1) isometry exists in the (x1 , x2 ) plane. In this case the problem reduces to the solution\nof the Laplace equation [9]\n1\n\u2202\u03c1 (\u03c1\u2202\u03c1 V (\u03c1, \u03b7)) + \u2202\u03b72 V (\u03c1, \u03b7) = 0 ,\n(1.2)\n\u03c1\n1\n2\n\nDc is the critical dimension of string- or M-theory: Dc = 10 or 11.\nAs suggested by 't Hooft [3], these results are limited to the large N , or planar, limit.\n\n2\n\n\fwhere the transformation between D, y, xi and V, \u03c1, \u03b7 is given below in equation (2.2). Most solutions with a U (1) isometry should not be viewed as exact solutions, but rather as solutions with\nsmearing; such solutions will be valid on length-scales longer than the typical smearing scale. The\npresence of the U (1) isometry does however allow for a reduction of the M-theory solutions to Type\nIIA solutions. 3 On the other hand, the Maldacena-Nu\u00f1ez (MN) solution [11] of equation (1.1) does\nhave a U (1) isometry in the (x1 , x2 ) plane and is nevertheless an exact solution with no smearing.\nAs we will see below, this solution will play a key role in our construction.\nIn this paper we solve explicitly the Laplace equation (1.2) for any boundary conditions given\nby [7], and in this way present an explicit Type IIA spacetime solution dual to any of the N = 2\nfour-dimensional SCFTs discussed in [8]4 . These solutions lift in an obvious way to M-theory\nsolutions up to the smearing discussed above. In section 2 we review the GM solution [7] with and\nwithout the U (1) isometry as well as the boundary conditions that correspond to particular N = 2\nSCFTs. In particular, in section 2.2.1 we discuss how the consistent boundary conditions lead to\ntwo classes of solutions. In sections 3 and 4 we present explicit solutions for these two classes\nof boundary conditions. In section 5 we discuss asymptotic properties of our solutions and we\nconclude in section 6. Some of the technical details of the results in sections 3 and 4 are relegated\nto the appendix.\n\n2\n\nA review of the GM solutions\n\nWithin the context of the gauge/string correspondence, AdSd+1 solutions of supergravity are leading\ncandidates for the string or M-theory duals of d-dimensional CFTs. As such, they have received\nconsiderable attention in the literature following Maldacena's seminal paper [1]. A novel approach\nto finding solutions with AdS5 factors and minimal (N = 1) supersymmetry was proposed in [4].\nSimilar techniques were used by GM [7] to construct N = 2 solutions of M-theory with an AdS5\nfactor.5 In this section we summarise the main results of [7] as a way of setting the notation\nused later in the paper. We pay particular attention to solutions which exhibit an additional U (1)\nsymmetry and show how this simplifies the problem substantially. We also review the boundary\nconditions proposed by GM; we find in particular that there are two distinct types of boundary\nconditions for which we construct explicit solutions in sections 3 and 4 below.\n3\n\nThis may prove useful given that there exists an explicit formulation of perturbative IIA string-theory on a\ngeneral spacetime [10].\n4\nRecently, a paper [12] appeared on the arXiv which considers U (1) reductions of the Toda equation in the context\nof the bubbling geometries considered in [5].\n5\nThe GM solutions build on earlier works [5] [6] which dealt with the Wick-rotated version of the problem.\n\n3\n\n\f2.1\n\nThe GM solution\n\nThe M-theory spacetime metric and fluxes for a background with an AdS5 factor and 16 supercharges has the form [5], [7] 6\n2\n\n\u0010\n\ne 2 + ds2\nds211 = \u03ba 3 e2\u03bb\u0303 4ds2AdS5 + y 2 e\u22126\u03bb\u0303 d\u03a9\n2\n4\n\n\u0011\n\n4\n\u2202y D\n(d\u03c7 + v)2 \u2212\n[dy 2 + eD (dx21 + dx22 )]\n1 \u2212 y\u2202y D\ny\nv = \u22172 dD\n\nds24 =\n\nG4 = \u03baF2 \u2227 d\u03a92\nF2 = 2(d\u03c7 + v) \u2227 d(y 3 e\u22126\u03bb\u0303 ) + 2y(1 \u2212 y 2 e\u22126\u03bb\u0303 )dv \u2212 \u2202y eD dx1 \u2227 dx2\n\u2202y D\ne\ne\u22126\u03bb = \u2212\ny(1 \u2212 y\u2202y D)\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere\n0 \u2264 \u03c7 < 2\u03c0\n\n0 \u2264 y < yc = N\n\n\u2212 \u221e \u2264 xi \u2264 \u221e\n\nThe function D = D(y, x1 , x2 ) specifies the solution and satisfies the three-dimensional Toda equation (1.1). The space with coordinates (y, x1 , x2 ) is topologically H 2 \u00d7 Ry1 , where H 2 is the hyperbolic plane with coordinates (x1 , x2 ) and \u22172 is the Hodge star on H 2 . Globally, the coordinates\non H 2 are identified by an element of a Fuchsian7 group \u0393 to give a compact Riemann surface\n\u03a3 = H 2 /\u0393. The solution has a manifest SU (2, 2) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) symmetry which comes from the\nAdS5 , S 2 and \u03c7 directions. These geometric symmetries are the same as the bosonic symmetries\none finds in N = 2 SCFTs.\nGeneral solutions of the Toda equation (1.1) are not presently known. In [9] it was pointed out\nthat solutions with a U (1) symmetry in the (x1 , x2 ) plane are much easier to find. To see how this\nsymmetry simplifies the problem it is useful to write the metric on the Riemann surface \u03a3 in polar\ncoordinates\nds2\u03a3 = dx21 + dx22 = dr2 + r2 d\u03b2 2 ,\nand consider solutions independent of \u03b2.

Given that the\nLaplace equation (1.2) plays a key role in electrostatic problems, the boundary conditions in the\n8\n\nq\n\nWhere \u03b1 = \u2212\n\nd\n2(D\u22122)(D+d\u22122)\n\nand \u03b3 \u2212\n\n\u03b1(D\u22122)\n.\nd\n\nHere d = 1 and D = 10.\n\n5\n\n\f(\u03c1, \u03b7, \u03b2) coordinates will be reminiscent of electromagnetic boundary conditions. Recall that in\nthese problems the line charge density can be derived using Gauss's law\nI\n\nE * dS =\n\nZ\n\n\u03bc dM\n\nwhere the surface S \u223c \u2202M is chosen to be a cylinder of height L and coaxial with the \u03b7 axis and\nof radius \u03c1. dS is an infinitesimal surface element with vector perpendicular to the surface and the\nvolume element is dM = \u03c1 d\u03c1 d\u03b2 d\u03b7. The charge volume density is \u03bc = 2\u03c0\u03bb(\u03b7)\u03b4(\u03c1)\u03b4(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b2 0 ) so that\nGauss's law is\nZ L\n\nd\u03b2 \u03c1\u2202\u03c1 V =\n\nd\u03b7\n\u03b7=0\n\nZ L\n\nZ 2\u03c0\n\u03b2=0\n\nZ \u03c1\n\nZ 2\u03c0\n\nd\u03b2\n\nd\u03b7\n\u03b2=0\n\n\u03b7=0\n\n\u03c10 =0\n\nd\u03c10 \u03c10 \u03bb(\u03b7)\u03b4(\u03c10 )\u03b4(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b2 0 )\n\nwhere the component of the field strength perpendicular to the surface is E\u03c1 = \u2202\u03c1 V . Comparing\nthe \u03b7 integrands we arrive at an expression for the charge density\n\u03bb(\u03b7) = \u03c1\u2202\u03c1 V |\u03c1=0 = y(\u03b7, \u03c1 = 0) .\nThe boundary conditions (2.5) translate in the (\u03c1, \u03b2, \u03b7)-space to the presence of an infinite\nconducting disc sitting at \u03b7 = 0 in the (\u03c1, \u03b2)-plane\n\u2202\u03c1 V (\u03c1, \u03b7 = 0) = 0 ,\nand a line charge density at \u03c1 = 0. To see this note that y = V\u0307 = 0 is satisfied if either \u03c1 = 0\nand/or \u2202\u03c1 V = 0 and each of these gives rise to a different set of boundary conditions. The former\nrequires the existence of the line charge \u03bb, while the latter will require the presence of, what we\nmay think of as, an infinite conducting plane at \u03b7 = 0. We discuss these in turn below.\n\n2.2.1\n\nConsistent \u03bb profiles\n\nRegularity of the space-time imposes the boundary condition that a line charge \u03bb density resides at\n\u03c1 = 0. In [7], it was argued that a physically sensible eleven-dimensional space-time theory imposes\nstringent constraints on the form of the line charge density. These constraints which we summarise\nbelow, arise from considering the quantisation of flux wrapping non-trivial cycles in the geometry\n\u2022 The line charge density \u03bb(\u03b7) must have a piece-wise integral gradient; i.e. it must be continuous and composed of segments of the form ai \u03b7 + \u03bbi , where ai \u2208 Z.\n\u2022 The positions of the kinks must be at integral values of \u03b7.\n\u2022 \u03bb(0) = 0.\n\u2022 The change in gradient of line segments at a kink must be integral and the gradient must\ndecrease with successive line element; i.e. ai \u2212 ai\u22121 \u2208 Z+ .\nA kink in which the gradient changes by k units gives rise to an Ak\u22121 singularity in the directions\ntransverse to AdS5 \u00d7 S 2 . If, in addition, we require that the space-time be smooth, we must impose\nthe further constraint\n6\n\n\f\u2022 The change in gradient only is reduced by one at any kink; ai \u2212 ai\u22121 = 1.\n\u2022 The gradient of the first line segment should be 1.\nAn interesting observation in [7] was that the intercept \u03bbi of the i'th line element is the total charge\nof the M5-branes which cause the kink at the beginning of the line segment. The integrality of\nthe charges is ensured by the above conditions on the line charge. Generic consistent line charge\ndensities have profiles of the form given in Figure 1.\n\u03bb\n\n\u03bb\n\n\u03b7\n\n\u03b7\n\nFigure 1: The two types of line charge; the MN-type (left) and the Uluru-type (right)\n\nFrom the above restrictions on the form of \u03bb we see that there are two types of \u03bb profiles: (i) \u03bb\nintercepts the \u03b7-axis only at the origin, and (ii) \u03bb intercepts the \u03b7-axis at the origin and a second\npoint \u03b7 = \u039b/2 > 0 for some positive real number \u039b. 9 In the former case the physical range of \u03b7 is\n\u03b7 \u2265 0, while in the latter case it is 0 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 \u039b/2. Given the characteristic shape of the latter profile\nwe will refer to these as Uluru spacetimes. The solutions we find will be quite different in the two\ncases and we construct them respectively in sections 3 and 4.\n\n2.2.2\n\nInfinite conducting disc\n\nWe now turn to the \u2202\u03c1 V = 0 condition. To see how it is equivalent to an infinite conduciting disc\nat \u03b7 = 0 consider first the general condition F (\u03c1, \u03b7) = 0, where F is some function. The vanishing\nof this function defines a curve \u03b7 = \u03b7(\u03c1) in (\u03c1, \u03b7)-space. An infinitesimal variation of this gives\n\u03b4F = \u2202\u03c1 F \u03b4\u03c1 + \u2202\u03b7 F \u03b4\u03b7 = 0\nso that the gradient of the curve is\n\u2202\u03c1 F\n\u03b4\u03b7\n=\u2212\n\u03b4\u03c1\n\u2202\u03b7 F\nIn the case at hand we have F (\u03c1, \u03b7) = \u2202\u03c1 V = 0 so that\n\u2202\u03c12 V\n\u03b4\u03b7\n=\u2212\n\u03b4\u03c1\n\u2202\u03c1 \u2202\u03b7 V\n9\n\nThis apparently awkward choice of notation will appear more natural in section 4.\n\n7\n\n\fWhat of the condition \u2202y D = 0? We can show that \u2202y D = 2\u03c1\u22121 \u2202y \u03c1 and furthermore, using the\ngeneral formulae found in section 3.1, that the 2 \u00d7 2 Jacobian is given by\nJ = \u03c1\u22121 eV\n\n0\n\n\u0010\n\n(V\u0307 0 )2 + \u03c12 (V 00 )2\n\n\u0011\n\nThe condition \u2202y D = 0 at y = 0 (but \u03c1 6= 0) may then be written as\n\u03c1\u22122 \u2202\u03b72 V\n1\n\u2212 \u2202y D =\n=0\n2\n(\u2202\u03c1 \u2202\u03b7 V )2 + (\u2202\u03b72 V )2\nTherefore at y = 0, the condition amounts to \u2202\u03b72 V = 0 or, using the Laplace equation and the fact\nthat \u2202\u03c1 V = 0, to\n\u2202\u03c12 V = 0\nWe have seen above that the boundary condition \u2202y D = 0 corresponds to the condition \u2202\u03c12 V = 0.\nReturning to the discussion above of the gradient of the constraint surface defined by \u2202\u03c1 V = 0 we\nsee the condition \u2202y D = 0 requires that the constraint surface has zero gradient; \u03b4\u03b7\n\u03b4\u03c1 = 0. In other\nwords, the condition describes the radial field strength \u2202\u03c1 V vanishing on the constraint surface\n\u03b7 =constant. We choose the constraint surface to lie at \u03b7 = 0. The constraint surface can be\nthought of as an infinite conducting disc in the (\u03c1, \u03b2)-plane. The reason for this interpretation of\nthe boundary condition as a conducting disc is that the surface charge induced by a conducting\ndisc imposes the boundary condition that the electric field has no component tangential to the\nconducting disc at the discs surface; i.e. that \u2202\u03c1 V and \u2202\u03b2 V vanish at \u03b7 = 0.\nThe problem of fixing the boundary conditions at the conducting plate can easily be taken care\nof by the method of images. The same field configuration that is caused by the semi-infinite line\ncharge (we do not consider \u03b7 < 0) and conducting plane are given by extending the line charge into\nnegative \u03b7 such that\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u2212\u03bb(\u03b7) if \u03b7 < 0\n\u03bb(\u03b7) \u2192 \u039b(\u03b7) =\n0 if \u03b7 = 0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u03bb(\u03b7) if \u03b7 > 0\nPut simply, the condition \u2202y D = 0 at y = 0 is simply the requirement that the potential V (\u03c1, \u03b7)\nmust be an odd function of \u03b7. The physical region will always be restricted to \u03b7 \u2265 0, but below we\nwill consider the formal solution over the whole real \u03b7 line using this method of images.\n\n2.3\n\nMetric Positivity Constraints\n\nThe metric (2.1) is mostly plus (\u2013+. . . +) for all values of (r, y). If the coordinate transformation\ndefined by the function V (\u03c1, \u03b7) is a good one then the metric (2.5) should also be mostly plus for\nall values of (\u03c1, \u03b7). In other words we must have\nV 00 V\u0307\n\u22650\n \u0303\n\u2206\n\nV 00\n\u22650\nV\u0307\n\nV 00\n\u22650\n2V\u0307 \u2212 V\u0308\n\n2V\u0307 \u2212 V\u0308\n\u22650\n \u0303 V\u0307\n\u2206\n\nwhich requires that either,\nV 00 \u2265 0\n\nV\u0307 \u2265 0\n\nor\n8\n\nV 00 \u2264 0\n\nV\u0307 \u2264 0\n\n\f\u03b7\n\n\u03b7\n\n- Conducting disc\n\u03b2\n\u03c1\n\n\u03c1\n\u2190 Image line charge\nFigure 2: Two ways of viewing the boundary condition\n\nUsing the equations of motion, we can summarise these conditions as\nV\u0308 /V\u0307 < 0\n\n(2.6)\n\nOne immediate consequence of this is that |V\u0307 | is a decreasing function of \u03c1.\n\n2.4\n\nDual gauge theory\n\nThe spacetimes described in equations (2.1), (2.5) have been conjectured by GM to be dual to\nN = 2 SCFTs. The line charge \u03bb can be used to read-off the generalised quiver [8] of the dual\ngauge theory. Explicitly:\n\u2022 We associate an SU (ni ) gauge group with each integer value of \u03b7 (which we denote as \u03b7i ).\nThese correspond to the circular nodes of the quiver diagram. The rank ni of the gauge\ngroup at that node is given by the value of the line charge corresponding to that point; i.e.\nni = \u03bb(\u03b7i ).\n\u2022 If there is a kink in the line charge profile, an extra ki fundamentals (hypermultiplets) are\nattached to the gauge group node. These are denoted by squares in the quiver diagram. The\nnumber of fundamentals ki is equal to the change in gradient at the node ni .\nAn example of a consistent charge profile \u03bb and the corresponding generalised N = 2 SCFT quiver\nis given in figure 3.\n\n3\n\nGM spacetimes on the hyperbolic plane\n\nIn this section we present explicit solutions for type IIA spacetimes (2.5) by constructing the\nfunction V (\u03c1, \u03b7) for a general \u03bb profile which intercepts the \u03b7-axis only at the origin. Such solutions\ncan be lifted to (smeared) M-theory solutions on the hyperbolic plane.

The integers\nkI \u2208 Z+ are the change in the gradient at the kink, given by kI = aI\u22121 \u2212 aI , where aI is the\ngradient of the I'th line element. Note that \u03b7I , nI \u2208 Z+ .\n\nsolutions of this type was the Maldacena-Nu\u00f1ez solution [11], which is in fact an unsmeared Mtheory solution with N = 2 supersymmetry and an AdS5 factor. We will find that the MN solution\nwill form a fundamental building block of the more general solutions we construct both in this and\nnext section, and that general IIA solutions can be thought of as superpositions of suitably rescaled\nMN solutions.\nIn section 3.1 we present the general formulae needed for the change of variables (2.2). Given\nthe central role of the MN solution in the subsequent analysis, and by way of presenting an explicit\nexample, we review the MN solution in section 3.2 and write it in terms of \u03c1, \u03b7 and V . Following\nthis, in section 3.3, we show how to construct IIA solutions for a general \u03bb profile with a single\nintercept along the \u03b7-axis by superposing MN solutions.\n\n3.1\n\nChanging variables\n\nThe change of coordinates from y and r to \u03c1 and \u03b7 as given in (2.2) is implicit and what is more\nvaries from solution to solution. Explicit solutions for the potential V may be found from the\nfunction \u03c1(r, y) by the following general method. The starting point are the functions \u03c1 = \u03c1(r, y)\n\n10\n\n\fand ln(r) = V 0 . Differentiating \u03c1 with respect to \u03b7 and \u03c1 gives\n0 = \u2202r \u03c1 \u2202\u03b7 r + \u2202y \u03c1 \u2202\u03b7 y\n1 = \u2202r \u03c1 \u2202\u03c1 r + \u2202y \u03c1 \u2202\u03c1 y\n\n(3.1)\n\nDifferentiating y = V\u0307 with respect to \u03b7, then applying the operator \u03c1\u2202\u03c1 to ln(r) = V 0 and equating\nthese two expressions for V\u0307 0 gives\nr\u2202\u03b7 y = \u03c1\u2202\u03c1 r\n(3.2)\nSimilarly appying the operator \u03c1\u2202\u03c1 to y = V\u0307 , then differentiating ln(r) = V 0 with respect to \u03b7 and\nfinally inserting the resulting expressions into the equation of motion V\u0308 + \u03c12 V 00 = 0 gives\nr\u2202\u03c1 y + \u03c1\u2202\u03b7 r = 0\n\n(3.3)\n\nThe four equations in (3.1), (3.2), (3.3) can be solved simultaneously to give\n\u2202\u03c1 r =\n\nr2 (\u2202r \u03c1)\nM\n\n\u2202\u03c1 y =\n\n\u03c12 (\u2202y \u03c1)\nM\n\n\u2202\u03b7 r = \u2212\n\nr\u03c1(\u2202y \u03c1)\nM\n\n\u2202\u03b7 y =\n\nr\u03c1(\u2202r \u03c1)\nM\n\nwhere\nM = r2 (\u2202r \u03c1)2 + \u03c12 (\u2202y \u03c1)2\nIt is useful to write\ndr\ndy\n\n!\n\n=\n\n\u2202\u03c1 r \u2202 \u03b7 r\n\u2202\u03c1 y \u2202\u03b7 y\n\n!\n\nd\u03c1\nd\u03b7\n\n!\n\nOne may then invert the square matrix to get\nd\u03c1\nd\u03b7\n\n!\n\n=J\n\n\u22121\n\n\u2202\u03b7 y \u2212\u2202\u03b7 r\n\u2212\u2202\u03c1 y \u2202\u03c1 r\n\n!\n\ndr\ndy\n\n!\n\nwhere J = r\u03c1/M is the 2 \u00d7 2 determinant.

As explained in section 2.2.1, a different type of profile are the Uluru\nprofiles; for these, \u03bb intercepts the \u03b7 axis not just at \u03b7 = 0 but also at \u039b/2 > 0. In this section\n13\n\n\fwe construct the general Uluru solution. We present three equivalent expressions for V - each\nform is useful in understanding a different feature of the solution. Since the solution for a general\nUluru profile is notationaly involved, we first present the simplest Uluru solution in section 4.1 to\ndemonstrate the key features of these solutions. The general Uluru solution is given in section 4.2.\n\u03bb\n\n\u03bb\n\n\u03bb\n\n\u03b7\n\n\u03b7\n\n\u03b7\n\nFigure 6: Examples of Uluru-type line charge profiles\n\n4.1\n\nA simple Uluru spacetime\n\nThe simplest Uluru solution has the following \u03bb profile\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\nN \u03b7 if 0 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 1\n\u03bbUluru (\u03b7) =\nN if 1 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 K + 1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 N (K + 2 \u2212 \u03b7) if K + 1 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 K + 2\nThis profile is interesting because the dual gauge theory is a theory with SU (N )K gauge group,\nNf = 2N fundamental 'quark' multiplets and K \u2212 1 scalar multiplets in the bi-fundamental. We\ncan think of it as a distant cousin of N = 2 SQCDK . This theory is conformal and, in the large\nN limit, has a large number of fields in the fundamental representation of SU (N ). It is also not\nan orbifold/orientifold or \u03b2-deformation of N = 4 SYM, and so provides perhaps the simplest nontrivial example of an N = 2 dual pair. Gauge theories of this type have recently received attention\nin the works [14].\n\u03bb\nN\n\n\u03b7\n0\n\nK +1\n\n1\n\nK +2\n\nFigure 7: A simple Uluru line charge density profile\n\n14\n\n\fThe boundary conditions discussed in section (2.2.2) apply equally to the \u03b7 = 0 and \u03b7 = K + 2\nintercepts in the \u03bb profile. In particular, the method of images implies that we can look for solutions\nwith \u03b7 on the whole real line with a periodic \u03bb like in figure 9.

The above can be seen most easily\nby observing that a single Uluru profile and its image as depicted in figure 8 can be written as\nthe m = 0 part of the above sum; periodicity along the \u03b7 axis is then achieved by summing over\nnon-zero m as shown in figure 9.\n\u03bb\nN\n\u2212K \u2212 2\n0\n\nK +2\n\n\u03b7\n\n\u2212N\n\nFigure 8: A simple Uluru-type line charge with its image line charge\n\n\u03bb\nN\n2K + 4\n\n\u03b7\n\n0\n\n\u22122K \u2212 4\n\n\u2212N\n\nFigure 9: A periodic Uluru-type line charge\n\nSince the Laplace equation is linear and we know the form of V for each constituent in the\nsum (4.1) we can write the potential V as\nVUluru\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3 q\nNX\n\u22121 \u03bdl + \u03b7\n2\n2\n=\n\u03c1 + (\u03bdl + \u03b7) \u2212 (\u03bdl + \u03b7) sinh\n.\n2 l=1\n\u03c1\n\n15\n\n\fIn the spacetime metric and fluxes V itself does not play a role, rather V\u0307 and its derivatives V\u0308 , V \u0307 0\nand V 00 = \u2212\u03c1\u22122 V\u0308 enter the expressions directly.

The integral form of V\u0307Uluru given in equation (4.3) is useful\nto show that V\u0307Uluru is convergent. To see this we can divide the integral into two integrals with\n0 < x < 1 and 1 < x < \u221e, respectively. Upon a change of integration variables x \u2192 1/x in the\nlatter integral it is easy to see that both integrals are convergent. The only potential divergence\ncomes from the x \u2192 \u221e limit. In this limit \u03b83 (\u03bel\u00b1 , q) \u2192 1 as can be seen from the infinite product\nexpression for \u03b83\n\u03bel\u00b1 =\n\n\u03b83 (z, q) =\n\n\u221e\nY\n\n(1 \u2212 q 2m )(1 + 2 cos(z)q 2m\u22121 + q 4m\u22122 ) .\n\n(4.5)\n\nm=1\n\nAs a result, this potential divergence cancels between the two terms in the integral (4.3) above for\neach value of l separately. It is also easy to see that the l = 3 part of V\u0307 in equation (4.3) is zero.\nAnother useful form for V\u0307 arises from the use of the following integral representation of the\nmodified Bessel function of the second kind K1\nZ \u221e\n\n2 /\u039b2 s\n\nds e\u2212\u03c1\n\ne\u2212n\n\n2 \u03c02 s\n\n=\n\n0\n\nwhere\n\u03c9n \u2261\n\n2\u03c1\nK1 (\u03c9n \u03c1) ,\nn\u03c0\u039b\n\n(4.6)\n\n2\u03c0n\n.\n\u039b\n\nInserting the infinite sum expression for \u03b83\n\u03b83 (z, q) =\n\n\u221e\nX\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\n16\n\n2\n\nq n e2izn ,\n\n(4.7)\n\n\fand using the above integral expression for K1 we arrive at another useful form for V\u0307\nV\u0307 (\u03c1, \u03b7) =\n\n2\nN\u039b X\n4 l=1\n\n= \u2212N \u039b\n= \u2212\n\n2N\n\u03c0\n\nZ \u221e\n\nds e\u2212\u03c1\n\n0\n\n2 Z \u221e\nX\n\n2 /\u039b2 s\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n2 \u03c02 s\n\ne\u2212n\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\u221e\nX\n\u2212\u03c12 /\u039b2 s\n\u2212n2 \u03c0 2 s\n\nds e\n\ne\n\nl=1 0\n2 X\n\u221e\nX\n\nh\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\ne2in\u03bel \u2212 e2in\u03bel\n\ni\n\nsin (\u03c9n \u03bdl ) sin (\u03c9n \u03b7)\n\nn=1\n\n\u03c1\nK1 (\u03c9n \u03c1) sin (\u03c9n \u03bdl ) sin (\u03c9n \u03b7) .\nn\nn=1\nl=1\n\n(4.8)\n\nTo see how such an expression arises as a solution to the original Laplace problem one may use a\nseparation of variables ansatz for V\u0307 with the most general solution consistent with the boundary\nconditions at \u03b7 = 0, \u039b/2. This takes the form\nV\u0307 =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03c1 {An K1 (\u03c9n \u03c1) + Bn I1 (\u03c9n \u03c1)} sin(\u03c9n \u03b7) ,\n\n(4.9)\n\nn=1\n\nfor some constant An and Bn and with I1 being a modified Bessel function of the first kind. The\npositivity condition (2.6) implies, in the large \u03c1 limit, that the Bn coefficients have to be zero. The\nAn coefficients can then be fixed using the Fourier series expansion for \u03bb\n\u03bbN (\u03b7) =\n\n\u221e\nX X\n2\u039b\nl=1,2 n=1\n\nn2 \u03c0 2\n\nsin(\u03c9n \u03bdl ) sin(\u03c9n \u03b7) ,\n\nand the \u03c1 \u2192 0 expansion of K1\n\n(4.10)\n\n1\n+ O(\u03c1) .\n\u03c9n \u03c1\nThis expression is perhaps the most natural one to write down for the solution of the Laplace\nequation (1.2) on an interval. It should also be clear now how to generalise this form of V\u0307 for\na general Uluru profile: one simply has to find the correct Fourier coefficients for \u03bb and insert\nthem into the separation of variables ansatz (4.10). As we will see in the following section, the\nexpression (4.8) is also useful in extracting the asymptotic behaviour of V\u0307 . We plot V\u0307 for this\nUluru solution in figure 10\nK1 (\u03c9n \u03c1) =\n\nV\n\n\u0397\n\n\u03a1\n\nFigure 10: V\u0307 for the Uluru solution.\n\n17\n\n\f4.2\n\nGeneral Periodic Solution\n\nThe considerations in the previous section generalise in a straightforward way to other Uluru-type\nline charge profiles.

This growth can be slowed by taking a\nlarge K or a large N limit but, however large N or K become (provided they are finite) the dilaton\nwill become large beyond some value of \u03c1. We conclude that, for \u03c1 \u001c K, the dilaton is small\nand the physics is approximated well by a weakly-coupled ten-dimensional string theory; however,\nwhere \u03c1 becomes much larger than K, the theory becomes eleven-dimensional and the perturbative\nstring description breaks down. A similar analysis may be carried out for the general periodic case\n(4.11). The key point is that V\u0307 dies off at large \u03c1 - consistent with the positivity conditions of\nthe space-time metric - and this leads to a growth in the dilaton at large \u03c1 so that, as described\nfor the example considered above, the solution is well-described by perturbative string theory for\nsmall values of \u03c1, but M-theory is required to provide a global description of the theory.\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper we have constructed explicit solutions of Type IIA supergravity with 16 supercharges\nand an AdS5 factor. These solutions are conjectured to be dual to general N = 2 SCFTs discussed\nrecently by Gaiotto [8]. Our construction is completely general: given a generalised quiver describing an N = 2 SCFTs there is a corresponding line charge profile \u03bb for which we construct explicitly\n19\n\n\fthe corresponding spacetime metric, dilaton and fluxes. We identify two types of line-charge profiles. Firstly, there are the aperiodic profiles, of which the MN solution is the archtypical example,\nfor which the general solution is given in section 3. Secondly, there are the \u03bb profiles which we\nhave called Uluru; the solutions of this type are discussed in section 4. It is interesting to note that\nboth kinds of solutions can be viewed as (finite or infinite) superpositions of MN solutions. This\nfits in well with our understanding of the MN solution as a dual description of a stack of M5-branes\nwrapping the hyperbolic plane. More general N = 2 SCFTs are given by some intersections of such\nstacks of M5-branes and our solutions validate this intuition.\nThe solutions we have constructed can be viewed as reductions of M-theory solutions with\nthe GM ansatz. The reduction introduces a smearing along the M-theory circle. As a result the\nsolutions are valid only on length scales larger than the typical smearing scale. We have seen that a\ngeneric feature of the periodic Uluru solutions are regions of spacetime for which the string coupling\nis large. It seems that to understand completely the dual description of these N = 2 SCFTs we\nwill need to go to the full M-theory. For this one will need to find non-smeared solutions of the\nToda equation (1.1).

Each line\nsegment lies in the range mi \u2264 |\u03b7| \u2264 mi+1 and is of the form \u03bbi = ai \u03b7 + sgn(\u03b7)qi . The requirement\nthat \u03bb(0) = 0, imposes q0 = m0 = 0. The full line charge density if then\n\u03bb(\u03b7) =\n\nn\n[\n\n(ai \u03b7 + sgn(\u03b7)qi )\n\ni=0\n\nThe conditions on the line charge to give a physical spacetime theory with the correct flux quantisation conditions require ai , qi , mi \u2208 Z. This line charge can be written in terms of a Fourier sine\nintegral, as in the Maldacena-Nunez case above. The Fourier integral coefficients are\nG(\u03b6) =\n=\n\n2 \u221e\n\u03bb(\u03b7) sin(\u03b6\u03b7)\n\u03c0 0\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015mi+1\nn \u0014 \u0012\n\u03b7\n2X\n1\n1\nai \u2212 cos(\u03b6\u03b7) + 2 sin(\u03b6\u03b7) + qi\n(1 \u2212 cos(\u03b6\u03b7))\n\u03c0 i=0\n\u03b6\n\u03b6\n\u03b6\n\u03b7=mi\nZ\n\n\u2261 Gs (\u03b6) + Gc (\u03b6)\nwhere\nGs (\u03b6) =\n\nn\n2 X\nai [sin(\u03b6mi+1 ) \u2212 sin(\u03b6mi )]\n\u03c0\u03b6 2 i=0\n\nGc (\u03b6) = \u2212\n\nn\n2 X\n[\u03bbi (mi+1 ) cos(\u03b6mi+1 ) \u2212 \u03bbi (mi ) cos(\u03b6mi )]\n\u03c0\u03b6 i=0\n\nand \u03bb\u03b1 (m\u03b2 ) = a\u03b1 m\u03b2 + q\u03b1 . In these formal sums we must remember \u03bb\u03b1 = 0 for \u03b1 outside of the\nrange 0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 L. We first focus on Gc (\u03b6). Continuity of the line charge means that at the point\n\u03b7 = mi\n\u03bbi\u22121 (mi ) = \u03bbi (mi )\nmeans that Gc (\u03b6) = 0. The remaining contribution to G(\u03b6) is given by Gs (\u03b6) which, if we change\nthe index in the second sum, is given by\nG(\u03b6) = \u2212\n\nn\n2 X\n(ai \u2212 ai\u22121 ) sin(\u03b6mi+1 )\n\u03c0\u03b6 2 i=0\n\nHowever, this is simply a finite sum of Fourier integral terms for the Maldacena-Nunez line charge\nG(\u03b6) = \u2212\n\nn\nX\n\n(ai \u2212 ai\u22121 ) GM N (\u03b6; mi )\n\ni=0\n\nWe see then that the general non-periodic line charge may be written as a sum of line charges for\nthe Maldecena-Nunez solution\n\u03bb(\u03b7) = \u2212\n\nn\nX\n\n(ai \u2212 ai\u22121 ) \u03bbM N (\u03b7; mi )\n\ni=0\n\n21\n\n\fNote that since ai < ai\u22121 , this is a sum of Maldacena-Nunez line charges with positive coefficients\nand so the metric positivity conditions on spacetimes constructed from such line charges will always\nbe obeyed.\n\nA.3\n\nGeneral periodic line charge\n\nConsider a charge density profile \u03bb\u039b which intersects the \u03b7-axis at zero and then again at a point\n\u03b7 = \u039b/2, one can construct such a profile, as a finite sum of Maldacena-Nunez charge densities as\ndescribed above.\n\u03bb\u039b (\u03b7) = \u2212\n\nL\nX\n\n(ai \u2212 ai\u22121 ) \u03bbM N (\u03b7; mi )\n\ni=0\n\nThis may then be made aperiodic, with wavelength \u039b\n\u03bb\u039b (\u03b7) \u2192 \u03bbp\u039b (\u03b7) \u2261\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03bb\u039b (\u03b1\u039b \u2212 \u03b7)\n\n\u03b1=\u2212\u221e\n\nso that the general periodic line charge density may be written in terms of the Maldecena-Nunez\nline charge density\n\u03bbp\u039b (\u03b7) = \u2212\n\n\u221e X\nL\nX\n\n(ai \u2212 ai\u22121 ) \u03bbM N (\u03b1\u039b \u2212 \u03b7; mi )\n\n\u03b1=\u2212\u221e i=0\n\nReferences\n[1] J.
