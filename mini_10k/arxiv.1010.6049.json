In the field of quantum\ninformation, multiparticle entanglement is viewed as a resource, enabling tasks like measurement-based quantum\ncomputation [2] or high-precision metrology [3]. In spite\nof many efforts, the characterization of these correlations\nturns out to be difficult. Especially genuine multipartite\nentanglement, which is most important from the experimental point of view, remains unruly and only scattered\nresults concerning its characterization are known [4\u20137].\nIn this Letter, we derive a general method to characterize genuine multiparticle entanglement using suitable relaxations. This relaxed problem turns out to be\ngood-natured, can be tackled with different methods and\nresults in a criterion that can be considered as a generalization of the Peres-Horodecki criterion [8] to the multipartite case. The goal of our work is two-fold: First,\nwe present powerful criteria for genuine multiparticle\nentanglement, which can be efficiently evaluated using\nsemidefinite programming and improve existing conditions significantly. They work for multi-qubit systems,\ncontinuous-variable or hybrid systems and can be evaluated, even if the mean values of only a few observables are\nknown. Furthemore, they lead to a computable entanglement monotone for genuine multiparticle entanglement.\nSecond, our method allows to analytically derive entanglement conditions for the family of cluster states [9],\nwhich are important states for tasks like measurementbased quantum computation. The sensitivity of these\nconditions improves exponentially with the number of\nqubits, which is an exponential gain compared with the\nexisting conditions. As a sideproduct of our investigations, we will also estimate the volume of the set of genuinely multipartite entangled states and gain insight into\nthe geometrical form of the set of biseparable states.\nSituation - We start by considering a three-particle\n\nFIG. 1: For three qubits, there are three convex sets of states\nthat are separable with respect to a fixed bipartition, namely\nthe bipartitions A|BC, B|AC and C|AB (blue, dashed lines).\nTheir convex hull (thick blue, dashed line) is the set of biseparable states. Each of the three sets is contained within the\nset of states that are PPT with respect to the corresponding\nbipartition (red, solid lines). Their convex hull forms the set\nof PPT mixtures (thick red, solid line).\n\nquantum state \u033a. This state is separable with respect to some bipartition, say, A|BC, if it is a mixture P\nof product states with respect to this bipartition,\nk\nk\nih\u03c8BC\n|, where the qk form a\n\u033a = k qk |\u03c6kA ih\u03c6kA | \u2297 |\u03c8BC\nprobability distribution. We denote these states by\n\u033asep\nA|BC . Similarly, we can define the separable states for\nsep\nthe two other possible bipartitions, \u033asep\nB|AC and \u033aC|AB .\nThen, a state is called biseparable if it can be written\nas a mixture of states which are separable with respect\nto different bipartitions [4]. That is, one has\nsep\nsep\n\u033abs = p1 \u033asep\nA|BC + p2 \u033aB|AC + p3 \u033aC|AB .\n\n(1)\n\nOn the other hand, a state that is not biseparable is\ncalled genuinely multipartite entangled. Whenever we\ntalk about multipartite entangled states in the following,\nwe refer to genuinely multipartite entangled states.\nTo characterize multipartite entanglement, we apply\n\n\f2\nthe method illustrated by Fig. 1. Instead of states like\n\u033asep\nA|BC that are separable with respect to a fixed bipartition, we consider a larger set of states, which can be\nmore easily characterized. For instance, for the bipartition A|BC we may consider states which have a positive\npartial transpose (PPT) [10]. It is well-known that separable states are also PPT [8]. We denote such states by\n\u033appt\nA|BC (and analogously for the other bipartitions).\nThus, we ask whether a state can be written as\nppt\nppt\n\u033apmix = p1 \u033appt\nA|BC + p2 \u033aB|AC + p3 \u033aC|AB .\n\n(2)\n\nWe call states of this form PPT mixtures. Clearly, any\nbiseparable state is a PPT mixture, so proving that a\nstate is no PPT mixture implies genuine multipartite entanglement. There are examples of states, which are PPT\nwith respect to any bipartition, but nevertheless multipartite entangled [11]. Hence, not all multipartite entangled states can be detected in this way, but, as we will\nsee, often the set of PPT mixtures is a very good approximation to the set of biseparable states. Finally, note that\nall definitions can be extended to N particles. Also, one\nmay use other relaxations of bipartite separability, e.g.\napply the criterion of Doherty et al. [12].\nThe advantage of considering PPT mixtures instead of\nbiseparable states is that the set of PPT mixtures can\nbe fully characterized with the method of linear semidefinite programming (SDP) [13] - a standard problem of\nconstrained convex optimization theory. Moreover, PPT\nmixtures can also be characterized analytically.\nCharacterization via entanglement witnesses - An\nentanglement witness is an observable W that is nonnegative on all biseparable states, but has a negative\nexpectation value on at least one entangled state. Let\nus first consider two particles, A and B. Then a decomposable witness is a witness W that can be written as\nW = P + QTA , where P and Q have no negative eigenvalues, (they are positive semidefinite, P, Q \u2265 0) and TA\nis the partial transpose with respect to A [14].\nFor more than two particles, we call a witness W fully\ndecomposable if, for every subset M of all systems, it is\ndecomposable with respect to the bipartition given by M\nand its complement M . This means, there exist positive\nsemidefinite operators PM and QM , such that\nfor all M : W = PM + QTMM .\n\n(3)\n\nThis observable is positive on all PPT mixtures, as it is\nnon-negative on all states which are PPT with respect to\nsome bipartition. But also the converse holds:\nObservation. If \u033a is not a PPT mixture, then there\nexists a fully decomposable witness W that detects \u033a.\nProof - The set of PPT mixtures is convex and compact. Therefore, for any state outside of it, there is a witness that is positive on all PPT mixtures. Furthermore,\npositivity on all states that are PPT with respect to a\nfixed (but arbitrary) bipartition implies that the witness\n\nis decomposable with respect to this fixed (but arbitrary)\nbipartition [14]. Thus, W = PM + QTMM for any M . \u0003\nPractical evaluation - To find a fully decomposable\nwitness for a given state, the convex optimization technique SDP becomes important, since it allows us to optimize over all fully decomposable witnesses. Given a\nmultipartite state \u033a, the search is given by\nmin Tr(W \u033a)\n\n(4)\n\ns.t. Tr(W ) = 1 and for all M :\nW = PM + QTMM , QM \u2265 0, PM \u2265 0 .\nThe free parameters are given by W and the operators\nPM for every subset M . If the minimum in Eq. (4) is\nnegative, \u033a is not a PPT mixture and hence genuinely\nmultipartite entangled. The operator W for which the\nnegative minimum is obtained is a fully decomposable\nwitness. Note that, due to X TM = (X T )TM and X \u2265 0 \u21d4\nX T \u2265 0, a witness that is decomposable with respect to\nM is also decomposable with respect to M . Thus, one\nneeds to check only half of all subsets in practice.\nEq. (4) has the form of a semidefinite program [13].\nIn contrast to usual optimization problems, global optimality of an SDP can be certified and the solution can\nefficiently be computed via interior-point methods. In\npractice, Eq. (4) can be solved with few lines of code, using e.g. the parser YALMIP [16] and, as solvers, SeDuMi\n[17] or SDPT3 [18]. Our implementation in MATLAB\nnamed PPTMixer can be found online [15].\nLet us discuss two variations of Eq. (4). First, in order\nto reduce the number of free parameters, one can restrict\noneself to witnesses W that obey W TM \u2265 0 for all M ,\ni.e., PM = 0 for all M . In the following, we will call\nthese witnesses fully PPT witnesses. For bipartite systems, decomposable witnesses and fully PPT witnesses\ndetect the same states. For the multipartite case, fully\nPPT witnesses are not as good as fully decomposable\nwitnesses, but they are easier to characterize.\nSecond, this SDP can also be modified to account\nfor the case that, instead of a full tomography, only\na restricted set of observables is measured. Let O =\n{O1 , ...Ok } be such a set of observables. Then, adding\nPk\nW = i=1 \u03bbi Oi to the constraints in Eq. (4) results in\nan SDP that searches for witnesses which can be evaluated knowing these observables. Note that for this program the free parameters are given by the real numbers \u03bbi\nand their number might be considerably smaller than in\nEq. (4). If the minimum in Eq. (4) is non-negative, there\nexists a PPT mixture with expectation values hOi i. However, one may then add further observables to O and run\nthe SDP again. Repeating this procedure gives more and\nmore sensitive tests. We will discuss an example later.\nIn practice, this program can even decide separability if\nthe Oi have already been measured, so it can be used to\ngain new insights into already performed experiments.\n\n\f3\nstate\n\nwhite noise tolerances ptol\nfully decomposable before\n|GHZ3 i\u22c6\n0.571\n0.571 [7]\n|GHZ4 i\u22c6\n0.533\n0.533 [7]\n|W3 i\u22c6\n0.521\n0.421 [7]\n|W4 i\n0.526\n0.444 [7]\n|Cl4 i\u22c6\n0.615\n0.533 [25]\n|D2,4 i\n0.539\n0.471 [26]\n|\u03a8S,4 i\n0.553\n0.317 [27]\nTABLE I: White noise tolerances of the fully decomposable\nwitnesses obtained by the SDP of Eq. (4) compared with the\ncorresponding tolerances of the most robust criteria known\nso far. For the states marked by \u22c6 , we verified that adding\nmore white noise than what is tolerated by Eq. (4) results in\na biseparable state, so the values are optimal.\n\nBut before proceeding to the examples, let us note\nthree more facts. First, in the formulation no dimension\nof the Hilbert space is fixed. Consequently, our approach\nis valid for any dimension and combined with the methods of Ref. [19] it can be directly used to study multipartite entanglement in continuous-variable or hybrid systems [20]. For continuous variables, it can be employed\ncomplementary to the methods of Ref. [21].\nSecond, our approach can also be used to quantify genuine multipartite entanglement. If in Eq. (4) the trace\nnormalization Tr(W ) = 1 is replaced by 0 \u2264 PM \u2264 11\nand 0 \u2264 QM \u2264 11, the negative witness expectation value\nis a multipartite entanglement monotone, since it obeys\nthe following properties: (i) It vanishes on all biseparable\nstates. (ii) It is convex. (iii) The quantity does not increase under protocols that consist of local operations of\neach party and classical communication between them.\n(iv) It is invariant under local basis changes. While most\nof these properties are straightforward to see - in particular, (iv) is implied by (iii) -, the proof of property\n(iii) is more technical (cf. Appendix A). Note that, in\nthe bipartite case, this monotone becomes the negativity [22].\nThird, as mentioned before, there are other possible\nchoices of supersets for the set of separable states, e.g.\nthe set of states that have a symmetric extension on a\nlarger Hilbert space (cf. Appendix B and [12]).\nNumerical examples - We test the criterion of Eq. (4)\nfor important pure three- and four-qubit states prepared\nin many experiments [23], using the white noise tolerance as a figure of merit. It is given by the maximal amount ptol of white noise for which the state\n\u033a(ptol ) = (1 \u2212 ptol )|\u03c8ih\u03c8| + ptol 11/2n is still detected as\nentangled [24]. Table I shows the white noise tolerances\nof our criterion, compared with the most robust criteria\nso far.\nStrikingly, the tolerances of the witnesses obtained by\nour SDP are significantly higher than previous ones. For\n\nthe GHZ and the W state of three qubits and the GHZ\nand the linear cluster state of four qubits, we even obtain\nthe best white noise tolerance possible, since we are able\nto show that for a larger amount of white noise the state\nbecomes biseparable (see Appendix C). This shows that\nour criterion is indeed optimal for these cases.\nTo show that the criterion of Eq. (4) works well\nfor a restricted set of observables, we consider the\nfour-qubit Dicke state with two excitations |D2,4 i [23].\nFor this state, the SDP yields a witness WD (see\nAppendix D) that consists of the observables O =\n{X \u22974 , Y \u22974 , Z \u22974 , X1 X2 Y3 Y4 , X1 X2 Z3 Z4 , Y1 Y2 Z3 Z4 },\ntheir distinct permutations and other observables that\ncan be measured in the same run. For example, a\nlocal measurement of X1 X2 X3 X4 yields knowledge of\nthe expectation value of X1 X2 113 X4 . The SDP finds\na witness consisting of O1 = X \u22974 , O2 = Y \u22974 and\nobservables obtained by replacing some Paulis by the\nidentity. Already with these observables, the white noise\n(2)\ntolerance is ptol \u2248 0.29495. We can proceed in this way\nand use additional observables Oi from the set O -\nincluding their permutations and observables obtained\nby replacing Pauli operators by 11- to produce strictly\n(i)\n(i)\nstronger witnesses WD . Their white noise tolerances ptol\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\nare ptol \u2248 0.38379, ptol \u2248 0.38383, ptol \u2248 0.45200 and\n(6)\n(6)\nfinally ptol \u2248 0.53914 as in Table I, since WD = WD .\nThird, we compute a lower bound on the volume of\ngenuinely multipartite entangled states. We created samples of 104 random mixed three-qubit states uniformly\ndistributed with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt distance\n(or the Bures distance) and check whether they are genuinely multipartite entangled. 6.28 % (Bures: 10.32 %)\nwere detected by fully decomposable and 0.44 % (Bures:\n1.06 %) by fully PPT witnesses. As expected, fully PPT\nwitnesses detect fewer states.\nWhile the problem can still be tackled numerically for\nsix or seven qubits, in recent experiments up to 14 ions\nhave been coherently manipulated [28]. Therefore, we\nstudy analytical witnesses which can be generalized to\nan arbitrary number of qubits in the following.\nAnalytical results - A fully decomposable witness for\nthe four-qubit linear cluster state |Cl4 i [23] that is obtained by the SDP of Eq. (4) is given by\nWCl4 =\n\n1\n1\n11 \u2212 |Cl4 ihCl4 | \u2212 (11 \u2212 g1 ) (11 \u2212 g4 ) ,\n2\n8\n\n(5)\n\nwhere g1 = Z1 Z2 113 114 and g4 = 111 112 Z3 Z4 are two of the\ngenerators of the cluster state's so-called stabilizer group.\nThis witness detects more states than the usual projector\nwitness Wproj = 21 11 \u2212 |Cln ihCln |, since WCl4 is obtained\nfrom Wproj by subtracting a positive operator P+ . For\nn qubits, the generators are, after a local basis change,\ng1 = X1 Z2 , gi = Zi\u22121 Xi Zi+1 for 1 < i < n and gn =\nZn\u22121 Xn . Then, the n-qubit\nlinear cluster state is defined\nQn\nby |Cln ihCln | = 2\u2212n i=1 (11 + gi ). The construction of\n\n\f4\nthe four-qubit cluster state witness can be generalized\nto an arbitrary number of qubits (see Appendix E). For\nseven qubits, e.g., a witness is given by\n1\n1\n[(11 \u2212 g1 ) (11 \u2212 g4 ) (11 \u2212 g7 )\nWCl7 = 11 \u2212 |Cl7 ihCl7 | \u2212\n2\n16\n+ (11 + g1 ) (11 \u2212 g4 ) (11 \u2212 g7 )\n+ (11 \u2212 g1 ) (11 + g4 ) (11 \u2212 g7 )\n+ (11 \u2212 g1 ) (11 \u2212 g4 ) (11 + g7 )] .\n\n(6)\n\nFor the case of n qubits, the white noise tolerance is\nptol = 1 \u2212 2\u2212n+1 + (k + 1)2\u2212k\n\n\u0001\u22121\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 1\n\n(7)\n\nwhere k = \u230a n+2\n3 \u230b. This result is remarkable for several reasons. First, WCln is the first example of a witness for genuine multipartite entanglement so far whose\nwhite noise tolerance converges to one for an increasing\nnumber of qubits. Thus, the volume of the largest ball\ninside the biseparable states around the totally mixed\nstate approaches zero. A similar scaling behavior of the\nentanglement in the cluster state has been found in Ref.\n[30]. Note that, however, they considered full separability and not genuine multipartite entanglement. For\nfull separability, this scaling behavior is not surprising,\nsince it is known that the largest ball of fully separable\nstates around the totally mixed states shrinks with increasing particle number [29]. Moreover, the white noise\ntolerance of Eq. (7) corresponds to a required fidelity\nFreq \u2248 1 \u2212 ptol \u2248 k2\u2212k for large n and therefore decreases\nexponentially fast with growing n. In contrast, the fidelity needed to detect entanglement using Wproj equals\none half, independent of the particle number. Interestingly, this exponential improvement comes with very low\nexperimental costs, since the additional term P+ can be\nmeasured with only one experimental setting. Finally,\nnote that our construction induces a similar construction\nfor the 2D cluster state.\nDiscussion - In this Letter, we presented an easily implementable criterion for genuine multipartite entanglement. We demonstrated its high robustness, connected\nit to entanglement measures and provided powerful witnesses for an arbitrary number of qubits.\nDue to its versatility, the criterion can be used to\ncharacterize the entanglement in various physical systems, e.g. in ground states of spin models undergoing\na quantum phase transition. Moreover, it is a promising\ntool to study multipartite entanglement in continuousvariable systems. Finally, we believe that, as an easy-touse scheme, it will be valuable for the analysis of experimental data that do not constitute a whole tomography.\nWe thank M. Kleinmann, T. Monz, S. Niekamp, A.

In Appendix\nA, we prove the properties (i) to (iv) of the entanglement\nmonotone given in the main text. Appendix B gives an\nexample for another superset that can be used to approximate the set of states which are separable with respect to\na fixed bipartition. In the third section of the Appendix,\nwe prove the optimality of some white noise tolerances\ngiven in Table I in the main text. Afterwards, we write\ndown a fully decomposable witness for the Dicke state\nwith two excitations in Appendix D. In the main text,\nthis witness was used to illustrate the case in which one\nconsiders only witnesses that consist of a restricted set of\nobservables. Finally, in Appendix E we provide a general\ntheory for witnesses of linear cluster states. Examples\nfor these witnesses have been given in the main text.\nAppendix A\n\nIn this appendix, we introduce an entanglement monotone for genuine multipartite entanglement that is motivated by the notion of fully decomposable entanglement\nwitnesses. Let us point out that this defined quantity\nequals the negativity for the bipartite case [1], hence it\ncan be considered as an extension of the negativity to the\nmultipartite case.\nProposition 1. For a generic multipartite state \u033a, consider\nN (\u033a) = \u2212 min Tr(\u033aW ),\n(8)\nW \u2208W\no\nn\nW = W \u2200M : \u2203 0 \u2264 PM , QM \u2264 1 : W = PM + QTMM ,\n\nwhere M stands for a possible partition of the subsystems.\nThen N (\u033a) has the following properties:\nbs\n\nbs\n\n\u2022 N (\u033a ) = 0 for all biseparable states \u033a .\n\u2022 N [\u039bLOCC (\u033a)] \u2264 N (\u033a) for all full LOCC operations.\n\u2020\n\u2022 N (Uloc \u033aUloc\n) = N (\u033a) for local basis changes Uloc .\nP\nP\n) \u2264 i pi N (\u033ai ) holds for all convex com\u2022 N ( i pi \u033aiP\nbinations i pi \u033ai .\n\nProof. The first statement follows directly from the fact\nthat any fully decomposable witness can only detect genuine multipartite entanglement, hence the expectation\nvalue satisfies Tr(\u033abs W ) \u2265 0 and vanishes for W = 0.\nFor the second property we effectively show N [\u039b(\u033a)] \u2264\nN (\u033a) for all trace-preserving, completely positive operP \u2020\nP\n\u2020\nations \u039b(\u033a) =\ni Ki Ki = 1 that adi Ki \u033aKi with\nmit a fully separable operator-sum representation, which\n\nmeans that each operator Ki = Ai \u2297 Bi \u2297 * * * \u2297 Fi has\na tensor product form. This set of operations defines a\nsuperset to the set of full LOCC operations, so we verify\nthe above property for an even larger set of possible operations [2]. Let us point out that for each operation \u039b,\nP \u2020\nthere exists an adjoint operation \u039b\u2020 (Y ) =\ni Ki Y Ki ,\nthat satisfies the identity Tr[\u039b(X)Y ] = Tr[X\u039b\u2020 (Y )] for\nall linear operators X, Y . The trace-preserving condition\nfor \u039b translates to a unital condition for the adjoint map\n\u039b\u2020 (1) = 1.\nLet us first prove the following statement: For each\ntrace-preserving, separable operation \u039b and for any decomposable operator W the observable \u039b\u2020 (W ) is decomposable as well. Suppose that W = P + QTM is an\nappropriate decomposition [3] with respect to a chosen\npartition M . Because of linearity we obtain \u039b\u2020 (W ) =\n\u039b\u2020 (P ) + \u039b\u2020 (QTM ). First, we want to check \"normalization\" 0 \u2264 \u039b\u2020 (P ) \u2264 1. Complete positivity provides\n\u039b\u2020 (P ) \u2265 0 since P \u2265 0 is positive semidefinite itself. If\none applies the adjoint map to (1 \u2212 P ) \u2265 0 and employs\nthe unital condition one obtains\n\u039b\u2020 (1 \u2212 P ) = \u039b\u2020 (1) \u2212 \u039b\u2020 (P ) = 1 \u2212 \u039b\u2020 (P ) \u2265 0,\n\n(9)\n\nhence the upper bound \u039b\u2020 (P ) \u2264 1 holds as well. We can\napply the same argument to \u039b\u2020 (Q) if we can fulfil the\nidentity \u039b\u2020 (QTM ) = [\u039b\u0303\u2020 (Q)]TM with \u039b\u0303 being completely\npositive and unital. Using the assumed tensor product\nstructure of each operator Ki it is straightforward to deduce the Kraus operators of the liner map \u039b\u0303 satisfying\nthis identity. These operators K\u0303i = \u00c3i \u2297 B\u0303i \u2297 * * * \u2297 F\u0303i are\ngiven by \u00c3i = Ai if A 6\u2208 M and \u00c3i = A\u2217i if A \u2208 M , and\nsimilar relations for all other operators. Let us point out\nthat this is the only step where one explicitly needs the\nseparable operator structure.\nVia this statement one finally obtains\nN [\u039b(\u033a)] = \u2212 min Tr[\u039b(\u033a)W ] = \u2212 min Tr[\u033a\u039b\u2020 (W )]\nW \u2208W\n\n\u2264 \u2212 min Tr[\u033aW ] = N [\u033a].\nW \u2208W\n\nW \u2208W\n\n(10)\n\nThe inequality holds since \u039b\u2020 (W ) is decomposable again,\nhence the optimization over the complete set of decomposable entanglement witnesses can only produce a lower\n(negative) expectation value.\nInvariance under local basis changes is a direct consequence of the previous property. Since any local basis\nchange Uloc represents an invertible full LOCC operation,\none obtains\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\nN (\u033a) \u2265 N (Uloc \u033aUloc\n) \u2265 N [Uloc\n(Uloc \u033aUloc\n)Uloc ] = N (\u033a).\n\nThus a local basis does not change the value of N (\u033a).\n\n\f6\nThe convexity statement\n!\nX\nX\npi Tr(\u033ai W )\npi \u033ai = \u2212 min\nN\nW\n\ni\n\n\u2264\n=\n\nX\ni\n\nX\n\ni\n\nh\ni\npi \u2212 min Tr(\u033ai W )\nW\n\npi N (\u033ai ),\n\n(11)\n\nfor a white noise contribution of p \u2248 0.521 the corresponding state is biseparable.\nConsider the tripartite case. Instead of supersets to\napproximate separable states for bipartition A|BC, we\nnow consider a strictly smaller set of states, i.e., any state\nof this subset must necessarily be separable. States of\nthis restricted class are denoted as \u033a \u0303A|BC , and similar for\nother bipartitions. If a given state has a decomposition\n\ni\n\nfollows from linearity of the trace and the fact that if one\nperforms independent optimizations then the obtained\nexpectation value can only be smaller. This completes\nthe proof.\n\nAppendix B\n\nHere, we would like to give another example of a superset that one can use to approximate the separable states\nof a given bipartition. For the bipartition A|BC, one\ncan consider states that possess a symmetric extension\nto k copies of system A, cf. Refs. [4]. This means that\nthe given state \u033aA|BC can be written as the reduced state\nof a multipartite state \u033aA1 ...Ak |BC that is invariant under all possible permutations of the copied subsystems.\nEvery separable state necessarily satisfies this extension\ncondition for any number of copies and we denote states\nk\nof this class by \u033asym\nA|BC . Consequently, we ask whether a\nthree-particle state can be decomposed as\nsymk\nsymk\nk\n\u033a = p1 \u033asym\nA|BC + p2 \u033aB|AC + p3 \u033aC|AB .\n\n(12)\n\nAny biseparable state can be written in this way, hence if\nthis expansion fails, genuine multipartite entanglement is\ndetected. This approach has appealing properties: With\nincreasing number of copies, these supersets converge to\nthe set of separable states [4]. Moreover, it is again possible to characterize such decompositions using entanglement witnesses that can be tackled via SDP. These witnesses are such that for all possible bipartitions M , the\noperator W must be a bipartite entanglement witness for\nthe case of k symmetric extensions as given in Ref. [4].\n\nAppendix C\n\nIn this appendix, we prove that our criterion is optimal for three-qubit GHZ and W states and for four-qubit\nGHZ and cluster states (cf. marked states of Table I).\nFirst, for the GHZ states mixed with white noise, the\nnoise thresholds at which the states become biseparable\nwere already derived in Ref. [5] and the values of ptol for\nour criterion coincide with these values.\nSecond, for the three-qubit W state |W3 i we introduce\na variation of our relaxation idea, in order to show that\n\n\u033a = p1 \u033a \u0303A|BC + p2 \u033a \u0303B|AC + p3 \u033a \u0303C|AB ,\n\n(13)\n\nthen it is clearly biseparable. The main difficulty is\nto find operational subset approximations, though results have been obtained along this direction recently [6\u2013\n8]. For the three-qubit case we employ an approximation that exploits the low dimensionality of the problem. Instead of all separable states of a 2 \u2297 4 system\nwe consider only separable states \u033a \u0303A|BC that are supported on the symmetric subspace of system BC. Since\nSym(HBC ) \u2243 C3 , one effectively has a 2 \u2297 3 system for\nA\n\u2265 0 becomes necessary\nwhich the PPT condition \u033a \u0303TA|BC\nand sufficient for separability [9]. Similar definitions are\nused for the other bipartitions. The search for an explicit\ndecomposition as given by Eq. (13) can be cast into the\nform of a SDP again.\nThe solution for \u033a(p) = (1 \u2212 p)|W3 ihW3 | + p1/8 is as\nfollows: The separable states for B|AC and C|AB are the\nsame as for the bipartition A|BC but with appropriate\npermutations of the subsystems. All probabilities equal\npi = 1/3. Thus, it is left to characterize \u033a \u0303A|BC . The\ncorresponding eigenspectrum is given by \u03bb1 = \u03bb2 = p/8,\n\u03bb3 = 3p/8 and \u03bb4 = 1 \u2212 5p/8 with respect to the eigenstates |\u03c71 i = |000i, |\u03c72 i = |111i,\n\u0010 \u221a\n\u0011\n2 2|1i \u2297 |\u03c8 + i \u2212 |011i /3,\np\n|\u03c74 i = a|0i \u2297 |\u03c8 + i + 1 \u2212 a2 |100i,\n|\u03c73 i =\n\n(14)\n(15)\n\n\u221a\nwith the abbreviation |\u03c8 + i = (|01i + |10i)/ 2. The parameter a \u2208 R is determined by the linear condition given\nby Eq. (13) and will be the root of a non-linear function.\nA\n\u2265 0 which is satThe only remaining condition is \u033a \u0303TA|BC\nisfied if p \u2265 p\u0304 with a critical white noise level given by\n\n\u0015\n\u0014\nq\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1\n367 \u2212 71 3 \u2212 2894 3 \u2212 2988 \u2248 0.52102.\n382\n(16)\nAt this white noise level one has a \u2248 0.98716. The noise\nlevel p\u0304 coincides with the maximal ptol for our criterion.\nFinally, for the four-qubit cluster state |Cl4 i we used\nthe algorithm of Ref. [10], that can be used to prove different forms of multipartite separability. We found that\na state with a noise contribution of p = 0.616 is biseparable, while the witness WCl4 of Eq. (6) in the main text\ndetects it for p < 8/13 \u2248 0.6154 as genuine multipartite\nentangled.\np\u0304 =\n\n\f7\nentanglement detection by measuring a restricted set of\nobservables is given by\n\nAppendix D\n\nThe fully decomposable witness for the Dicke state\n|D2,4 i which was used in the main text to demonstrate\n\nWD =\n\n1 \u0002\n11 + \u03b11 X \u22974 + \u03b11 Y \u22974 + \u03b12 Z \u22974 + \u03b13 (X1 X2 Y3 Y4 + perms) + \u03b14 (Z1 Z2 Y3 Y4 + perms)\n(17)\n16\n+\u03b14 (Z1 Z2 X3 X4 + perms)+ \u03b15 (X1 X2 113 114 + perms)+ \u03b15 (Y1 Y2 113 114 + perms)+ \u03b16 (Z1 Z2 113 114 + perms)] .\n\nHere, X1 X2 Y3 Y4 + perms is the sum over all distinct permutations of X1 X2 Y3 Y4 . Moreover, \u03b11 = 0.014, \u03b12 = \u22120.095,\n\u03b13 = 0.0046, \u03b14 = 0.16, \u03b15 = \u22120.14, \u03b16 = \u22120.15.\nAppendix E\n\nHere, we prove the generalized n-qubit version WCln of\nthe cluster state witnesses given in the main text to be\nfully decomposable witnesses. For four and seven qubits,\nWCln reduces to forms of Eqs. (6) and (8) of the main\ntext, respectively. First, let us briefly introduce the notation that we use.\nConsider an arbitrary graph G = (V, E) that is defined\nby a set V of vertices which correspond to qubits and a\nset E of edges that connect some of these vertices.\nThen, by N (i) we denote the neighborhood of qubit i, i.e.,\nthe set of all vertices that are connected to i by an edge.\ne (i) = N (i) \u222a {i}.\nMoreover, we define N\nThe commuting operators defined by\nY\nZk , i = 1, . . . , n\n(18)\ng i = Xi\nk\u2208N (i)\n\nare the generators of the so-called stabilizer group, i.e.,\n{S1 , . . . , S2n } = hg1 , . . . , gn i. In other words, every stabilizer Si can be written as a product of some (or all) of\nthese generators gi .\nThe graph state |Gi associated to the given graph G is\nthen uniquely defined by\ngi |Gi = |Gi, \u2200 i = 1, . . . , n .\n\n(19)\n\nOne can also associate an orthonormal basis to a graph\nG. The elements |a1 . . . an iG of this so-called graph state\nbasis are defined by\ngi |a1 . . . an iG = (\u22121)ai |a1 . . . an iG , \u2200 i = 1, . . . , n . (20)\nConsequently, |Gi = |0 . . . 0iG . Also, note that projectors\non these vectors can be written as\nG |a1 . . . an iha1 . . . an |G =\n\nn\nY\n(\u22121)ai gi + 11\n\ni=1\n\n2\n\n.\n\n(21)\n\nFor better readability, we will drop the subscript G in the\nfollowing and write |a1 . . . an iG = |~ai. Thus, except for a\n\nsingle exception that we will explicitly mention, all vectors in the following have to be understood in the graph\nstate basis. However, it is important to note that all partial transpositions will be done w.r.t the computational\nbasis.\nA partition M is a subset of the set of all qubits, while\nwe refer to the set made up of partition M and its complement M as bipartition M |M .\nWith the notation clarified, we first prove three lemmas\nto prepare the proof that the operator WCl presented\nin the paper is a fully decomposable witness. The first\nof these lemmas starts from two orthogonal graph state\nbasis vectors and shows which kind of partial transpositions one can apply to one of these vectors such that\nthe two resulting vectors are orthogonal. Lemma 3 supplies an upper bound on the eigenvalues of any partially\ntransposed state in terms of the state's Schmidt coefficients. Finally, Lemma 4 provides some kind of construction manual. Given a qubit and starting from a\ngraph state basis vector, it tells us how we can construct\nexpressions out of this basis vector which are invariant\nunder a partial transposition on the given qubit.\nThese lemmas will then be used in Proposition 5 to prove\nthat the presented operator WCln is a fully decomposable\nwitness.\nLemma 2. Given a graph G = (V, E) of n qubits and\nan arbitrary bipartition M |M of these qubits. Let |~ai\nand |~bi be two arbitrary states in the associated graph\nstate basis. Let UM be the set of all qubits that lie in the\ne (i) \u2286\nsame partition as their neighbors, i.e., UM = {i | N\ne\nM \u2228 N (i) \u2286 M }. If there is a qubit i \u2208 UM , s.t. bi 6= ai ,\nthen\nh~b| (|~aih~a|)TM |~bi = 0\n\n(22)\n\nProof. Let gi , i = 1 . . . n be the generators defined by\nEq. (18). Since X T = X, Y T = \u2212Y , Z T = Z and 11T =\n11, the partial transposition of a product of generators\nonly changes the product's sign. Thus, we can describe\nthe action of the partial transpose TM w.r.t partition M\n\n\f8\non products of generators by\nn\nY\n\ni=1\n\ngixi\n\n!TM\n\nf (~\nx)\n\n= (\u22121)\n\nn\nY\n\ngixi\n\ni=1\n\n!\n\nNote that the support supp(f ) of a Boolean function contains the bits that the function depends on, i.e.,\n,\n\n(23)\n\nwhere xi \u2208 {0, 1}. Here, f depends on M and is a\nBoolean function defined by\nf : {0, 1}n \u2192 {0, 1}\n\n(24)\n\uf8f1\n\u0013TM\n\u0012 n\nn\n\uf8f4\nQ\nQ xi\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\ngixi\n=\ngi\n\uf8f20, if\n~x 7\u2192 f (~x) =\n.\n\u0013TM i=1 n\n\u0012i=1\nn\n\uf8f4\nQ xi\nQ\n\uf8f4\nx\ni\n\uf8f4\ng\n=\n\u2212\n1,\nif\ng\n\uf8f3\ni\ni\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nsupp(f ) = {i | \u2203 ~x, s.t.f (x1 , . . . , xi , . . . , xn ) 6= f (x1 , . . . , xi \u2295 1, . . . , xn )} .\n\n(25)\n\nDue to the explicit form of the gi , flipping the value of xi cannot change f (~x), if i \u2208 UM . Therefore, UM \u2229supp(f ) = {}.\nFor this reason, we can pull qubits in UM out of the partial transposition TM in the following way (using also Eq. (21)).\n\uf8ee\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6TM \uf8f9\nn\nbj\nai\nai\nY\nY\nY\n(\u22121) gj + 11\n(\u22121) gi + 11 \uf8f8 \uf8fa\n(\u22121) gi + 11 \uf8ed\n\uf8ef\nT\nh~b| (|~aih~a|) M |~bi = Tr \uf8f0\n(26)\n\uf8fb\n2\n2\n2\nj=1\ni\u2208UM\n\n11 \u2212gi +11 = 0, the last expression vanishes if\nSince gi +\n2\n2\nthere is an i \u2208 UM , such that bi 6= ai .\n\nLemma 3.

Together with the form of\nthe generators [see Eq. (18)], this implies that there\nis no Y on qubit k.\nThe second part of the right-hand side of Eq.

(34) is invariant\nunder Tk .\nLet us now return to the main proof in which we will\nneed Lemmas 2, 3 and 4.\nProposition 5. Let |Cln ihCln | be an n-qubit linear cluster state with n > 3 and gi the generators of its stabilizer\ngroup. Let B = {\u03b2i } be a subset of all qubits such that\ne\ne\nN\nP(\u03b2i ) \u2229 N (\u03b2j ) = {} for i 6= j. We define m = |B|. Let\nbe\nthe\nsum over all vectors ~s of length m with ele~\ns\nments si = \u00b11\nP that contain at least two elements that\nare \u22121, i.e., m\ni=1 si \u2264 m \u2212 4. Then,\n!\n1 X Y si gi + 11\n1\n(35)\nWCln = 11 \u2212 |Cln ihCln | \u2212\n2\n2\n2\n~\ns i\u2208B\n\n(34)\n\ne (k)\ni\u2208\n/N\n\nis a fully decomposable witness for |Cln ihCln |, i.e., for\nany strict subset M of all qubits, it can be written in the\nform WCl = PM + QTMM , where PM \u2265 0, QM \u2265 0.\nFor the sake of brevity, we define P+\n=\nP Q\nsi gi +11\n.\nNote\nthat\nP\nis\na\nsum\nof\nall\nprojec+\n~\ns\ni\u2208B\n2\ntors onto graph state basis vectors that contain at least\ntwo excitations in B, i.e., two bits that equal one. For\nexample, if we choose B = {1, 4, 7, . . . } for the sake of\nillustration,\nX\nP+ =\n(|0x1 x2 1x3 x4 1 . . . ih0x1 x2 1x3 x4 1 . . . |\n~\nx\u2208{0,1}n\u2212m\n\n+ |1x1 x2 0x3 x4 1 . . . ih1x1 x2 0x3 x4 1 . . . |\n\n+ |1x1 x2 1x3 x4 0 . . . ih1x1 x2 1x3 x4 0 . . . |\n+ |1x1 x2 1x3 x4 1 . . . ih1x1 x2 1x3 x4 1 . . . |\n\n+ ...)\n\n(36)\n\nThis also illustrates why the presented construction does\nnot work for linear cluster states that consist of three or\nless qubits. In such a case, B could only have one element,\nsince the elements' neighborhoods cannot overlap. Then,\nhowever, one cannot fulfill the condition that there must\nalways be two bits in B that equal one. Note that sets\n\n\f10\nB = {1, 4} and B = {1, 4, 7} for four and seven qubits,\nrespectively, result in the witnesses WCl4 and WCl7 of\nEqs. (6) and (8) of the main text. Moreover, these choices\nof B lead to the noise tolerance of Eq. (9) of the main\ntext.\n\nIn other words, r equals the number of bits \u03b2i \u2208 B which\ndo not lie at the border of M (or M ), i.e. they do not\nobey\n\nProof. First, we will provide a way to construct an appropriate operator PM \u2265 0 for every M . The main trick\nis to do this in such a way that this operator is invariant\nunder certain partial transpositions. Second, we will use\nT\nthese PM to show that QM = (W \u2212 PM ) M \u2265 0 for every M .\nNote that we order the qubits \u03b2i in a canonical way such\nthat \u03b2i < \u03b2i+1 . To simplify notation, we define bitstring\ne (\u03b2i ) (of |N\ne (\u03b2i )| bits length) in such a way\nw\n~ i for every N\nthat its bits define to which partition the correspoding\nqubits belongs. w\n~ i = (\u03c9\u22121 , \u03c90 , \u03c9+1 ), \u03c9j \u2208 {0, 1}, means\nthat qubit \u03b2i + j does not belong to M if \u03c9j = 0 and it\nbelongs to M if \u03c9j = 1. For \u03b2i being the first qubit, we\nconsider w\n~ i = (\u03c90 , \u03c9+1 ); for \u03b2i being the last qubit, we\nuse w\n~ i = (\u03c9\u22121 , \u03c90 ).\nGiven M , we proceed in the following way to construct\nPM .\n\nThus, for r = 0, all \u03b2i \u2208 B obey this property, for r = 1,\nthere is one exception.\nNote that the operator PM constructed via the given algorithm is either zero or a sum of one-dimensional projectors onto basis states, i.e.,\nX\nPM =\n|~aih~a| .\n(40)\n\n(0)\n\n2. Loop through the values of i = 1, 2, . . . , m and up(i)\ndate PM until you reach i > m. Then proceed\n(i)\nwith step 3. The update of PM is carried out in\nthe following way.\n(i)\n\nI If w\n~ i = 01 or w\n~ i = 10, then PM =\n(i\u22121)\n(i\u22121)\nPM\n+ Zk PM Zk , where k \u2208 N (\u03b2i ).\n(i)\n\n(i\u22121)\n\nII If w\n~ i = 11 or w\n~ i = 00, let PM = PM\ne\n(ii) If |N (\u03b2i )| = 3:\n\n(39)\n\n~\na\n\n(0)\n\nThis can be seen by the fact that PM = |Cln ihCln | =\n|0 . . . 0ih0 . . . 0|, the application of Z only flips a bit and\nfinally |Cln ihCln | is subtracted again. Let us illustrate\nthe algorithm by a concrete example.\nExample of the algorithm: Consider an eight-qubit\ncluster state and M = {2, 3, 5}.

According to the premise of nonoverlapping neighborhoods of the qubits in B, we have\ne (\u03b2j ) \u2229 N\ne (\u03b2k ) = {}. Therefore, the partial transposiN\ntions in Eqs. (44) for i = j always affect qubits different\nfrom the ones that are affected by the partial transpo(t\u22121)\nsitions for i = k. For this reason, Eqs.

We will use this important property later.\nLet us proceed with the proof. Since PM is zero or has\nthe form of Eq. (40), we know that PM \u2265 0. Thus, it\nT\nremains to show that (WCl \u2212 PM ) M = QM \u2265 0, \u2200 M .\nOperators that are diagonal\nP Qnin a graph state basis can\nbe written in the form ~x i=1 gixi , where the sum runs\nover binary strings ~x that depend on the operator. Since\nany partial transposition can at most introduce minus\nsigns in some terms of this sum, such operators remain\ndiagonal under any partial transposition.

Therefore,\n\nNote that the equivalence can best be see in\nEq. (36). Also, Eq. (36) implies that there must\nbe at least two bits of ~k, say ki0 , kj0 \u2208 B, with\ni0 6= j0 , such that ki0 = kj0 = 1.\nIn the case PM = 0, Eq.

Also, depending on whether i0 = t or\nj0 = t, Eqs. (46) can be applied to whichever of\nthese two qubits is different from t. The invariance\ngiven by Eqs. (46) then implies that this qubit can\nbe treated as if it lay on the border of M (or M )\nand therefore Lemma 2 yields\n\u0011TM\n\u0010\n(t\u22121)\nh~k| PM\n|~ki = 0\n(51)\nand therefore Eq. (50) holds.\n\n2. h~k|P+ |~ki = 0\nTo show that Eq. (48) holds, we need to prove that\n1\nh~k| (|Cln ihCln | + PM )TM |~ki \u2264 .\n2\n\n(52)\n\n\f12\nIn the case PM 6= 0, PM is given by Eq. (40) and\nEq. (52) is equivalent to\nh~k| |Cln ihCln | +\n\nX\n~\na\n\n|~aih~a|\n\n!TM\n\n1\n|~ki \u2264 .\n2\n\n(53)\n\nP\n(t\u22121)\nconsists\nNote that |Cln ihCln | + ~a |~aih~a| = PM\nr\u22121\nof 2\nterms, as one starts with one term and dou(t\u22121)\nbles this number (r \u2212 1) times to obtain PM .\nTherefore, it is enough to show that\nT\nh~k| (|Cln ihCln |) M |~ki \u2264 2\u2212r\n\n(54)\n\nT\nh~k| (|~aih~a|) M |~ki \u2264 2\u2212r \u2200 |~ai\n\n(55)\n\nand\n\nholds. We will do this by using Lemma 3. However, since the vectors |~ai are basis vectors of the\ngraph state basis of |Cln i, |~ai and |Cln i are LUequivalent. Therefore, they have the same Schmidt\ncoefficients and Lemma 3 results in the same upper\nbounds. For this reason, it suffices to show only\none of these upper bounds, namely\nT\nh~k| (|Cln ihCln |) M |~ki \u2264 2\u2212r .\n\n(56)\n\nThe idea behind the subsequent proof of Eq. (56)\n(i)\nis that, every time PM changes in our algorithm,\nr is increased, but at the same time, a Bell pair\nwhich has Schmidt coefficients { \u221a12 , \u221a12 } is created\nwhich results in a smaller upper bound according\nto Lemma 3.\nTo easily calculate the Schmidt coefficients of |Cln i\nwith respect to bipartition M |M , we transform\n|Cln i via local transformations into disconnected\nBell pairs whose qubits are in different partitions.\nIn order not to change the Schmidt coefficients during this transformation, we apply the following two\noperations to the graph.\n\u2022 Local Complementation (LC): Pick a qubit j\nand invert its neighborhood graph. In other\nwords, if between two neighbors of j there is\nan edge, delete it. If between two neighbors\nof j there is no edge, add an edge between\nthem. Since this operation corresponds to the\napplication of local unitaries, the Schmidt coefficients remain unchanged.\n\u2022 Controlled-Z (CZ): Apply a controlled-Z operation to two qubits in the same partition. If\nthey are connected by an edge, this will delete\nthe edge. If they are not connected, this will\ncreate an edge. As this unitary operation is\nonly applied on qubits in the same partition,\nit does not change the Schmidt coefficients.\n\n(i)\n\nFIG. 2: For every case in which PM changes in the algorithm,\nwe explicitly demonstrate that it is possible to create a Bell\npair via a sequence of local transformations. Note that the\ncases w\n~ k = 100 and w\n~ k = 011 follow from w\n~ k = 110 or w\n~k =\n001 due to symmetry reasons.\n\nSince these transformations can be applied to each\ne (\u03b2j ) individually to create a Bell pair between\nset N\nthe two partitions (see Fig. 2) it is possible to end\nup with distinct Bell pairs between the two partitions.\nMoreover, the number q of Bell pairs that one can\ne (\u03b2j )\ncreate by transforming the qubits in each N\n(i)\nseparately obeys q \u2265 r, as every time that PM\nis changed in the algorithm (including step i = t)\ncorresponds to a configuration shown in Fig. 2.\nFurthermore, each of these configurations allow for\nthe creation of a disconnected Bell pair.\nSince the Schmidt coefficients of a single Bell pair\nare { \u221a12 , \u221a12 }, Lemma 3 yields\nT\nh~k| (|Cln ihCln |) M |~ki \u2264 2\u2212q ,\n\nWith q \u2265 r, this implies that Eq. (56) holds.\n\n(57)\n\n\f13\nIn the case PM = 0, we need to show that\n1\nT\nh~k| (|Cln ihCln |) M |~ki \u2264 .\n2\n\n(58)\n\nNote that PM = 0 is equivalent to r \u2264 1. On\none hand, r = 0 means that for each i = 1, . . . , n,\ne (i) \u2286 M or N\ne (i) \u2286 M holds. Since\neither N\nM 6= {1, . . . , n}, deleting all edges within M and\nM will lead to at least one Bell pair, which has\nSchmidt coefficients { \u221a12 , \u221a12 }. With Lemma 3,\nEq. (58) holds.\nOn the other hand, for r = 1, Eq. (58) also holds,\nsince due to Fig. 2 the Schmidt coefficients are\ngiven by at least one Bell pair. Therefore, the maximal coefficient is 12 .\nThis finishes the proof of Proposition 5.\n\n[1] G. Vidal and R. F. Werner, Phys. Rev. A 65, 032314\n(2002); M. B. Plenio, Phys. Rev.
