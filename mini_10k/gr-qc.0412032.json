Some further properties\nof this approach are also examined.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nDifferently from gauge theories [1] the fundamental field of general relativity is not a connection,\nbut a metric tensor-or equivalently, a tetrad field. The difficulties in quantization have created\na continuous interest in developing a connection-based formulation of the theory [2], which\nwould bring it closer to the gauge theories describing the other fundamental interactions of\nNature and to their successful quantization techniques [3]. The standard way of bringing\nconnections to the forefront is to use Palatini's variational method, by which the connection\nand the tetrad are independent variables. The field equations are, accordingly, obtained from\nindependent variations with respect to both the tetrad and the spin connection. The first\nvariation yields Einstein's equation, whereas the second yields a constraint equation whose\nsolution defines the connection in terms of the tetrad. Once written in terms of the tetrad,\nhowever, the connection loses its role as fundamental field, and one is led back to the usual\nmetric-based formulation. In a genuine connection theory the spin connection should keep the\nrole of fundamental field and should not be written in terms of the tetrad. It is the tetrad, as\na derived field, that must be written in terms of the connection. The last point is the basic\ndifference between the construction we are going to consider here and all existing approaches\nto the so called connection-based theories of gravity [4].\nThe reformulation of general relativity as a Lorentz-valued connection theory for gravitation requires a change in the traditional kinematic paradigm of the theory. More specifically,\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nDedicated to Jos\u00e9 Pl\u0131\u0301nio Baptista on the occasion of his seventieth birthday.\nPermanent address: Universidad Tecnol\u00f3gica de Pereira, A.A. 97, La Julita, Pereira, Colombia.\n\n1\n\n\finstead of spacetime diffeomorphisms, the fundamental transformations behind a connectionbased formulation of general relativity must be assumed to be the local Lorentz group [5]. In\norder to implement such a change it is necessary to devote special attention to the Minkowski\ntangent space M, which is naturally attached to each point of spacetime R and on which the\nLorentz transformations will take place. In this way, general relativity can be reinterpreted as\na theory emerging from the requirement of covariance under local Lorentz transformations [6],\nand accordingly the spin connection turns up as the basic field representing gravitation. It is\nimportant to notice that, as the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian stands on, this reinterpretation\nentails no change in dynamics, but only in the underlying kinematics of the theory. Conceptual changes, however, do show up which lead to fundamental differences with respect to the\nordinary metric formulation. The basic purpose of this work is to study these differences.\n\n2\n\nModified Palatini Formulation\n\n2.1\n\nThe Spin Connection\n\nWe use the Greek alphabet (\u03bc, \u03bd, \u03c1, . . . = 1, 2, 3, 4) to denote indices related to spacetime,\nand the Latin alphabet (A, B, C, . . . = 1, 2, 3, 4) to denote indices related to each one of the\nMinkowski tangent spaces, whose metric tensor is chosen to be \u03b7AB = diag(+1, \u22121, \u22121, \u22121).\nUsing this notation, the spin connection A\u03bc , a field assuming values in the Lie algebra of the\nLorentz group, is written as\n(1)\nA\u03bc = 21 AAB \u03bc JAB ,\nwhere JAB are the Lie algebra generators written in some appropriate representation. Since\nAAB \u03bc = \u2212ABA \u03bc , it automatically preserves the Minkowski metric:1\n\u2202\u03bc \u03b7AB \u2212 AC A\u03bc \u03b7CB \u2212 AC B\u03bc \u03b7AC = 0.\nThe curvature of the connection AA B\u03bc is\n\u03a9A B\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc AA B\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd AA B\u03bc + AA E\u03bc AE B\u03bd \u2212 AA E\u03bd AE B\u03bc .\n\n(2)\n\nDenoting by h\u03bc = hA \u03bc \u2202A a general tetrad field, the torsion of AA B\u03bc is written in the form\nT A \u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc hA \u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd hA \u03bc + AA E\u03bc hE \u03bd \u2212 AA E\u03bd hE \u03bc .\n\n(3)\n\nIt is important to remark that curvature and torsion are properties of a connection [7]. Notice,\nhowever, that in the case of non-soldered bundles, as for example in Yang-Mills theories, no\ntetrad exists, and consequently torsion cannot be even defined. This is completely different\nfrom general relativity, whose spin connection, the so called Ricci coefficient of rotation, has\nvanishing torsion. Although vanishing, therefore, torsion is always present in general relativity.\nUsing the tetrad, a spin connection AA B\u03bc can be related with the corresponding spacetime\nconnection \u0393\u03c1 \u03bd\u03bc through\n(4)\n\u0393\u03c1 \u03bd\u03bc = hA \u03c1 \u2202\u03bc hA \u03bd + hA \u03c1 AA B\u03bc hB \u03bd .\n1\n\nThe presence of nonmetricity would spoil the anti-symmetry in the first two indices, and consequently the\nconnection would not be Lorentz-valued.\n\n2\n\n\fThe inverse relation is, consequently,\nAA B\u03bc = hA \u03bd \u2202\u03bc hB \u03bd + hA \u03bd \u0393\u03bd \u03c1\u03bc hB \u03c1 .\n\n(5)\n\nEquations (4) and (5) are simply different ways of expressing the property that the total-that\nis, acting on both indices-derivative of the tetrad vanishes identically:\n\u2202\u03bc hA \u03bd \u2212 \u0393\u03c1 \u03bd\u03bc hA \u03c1 + AA B\u03bc hB \u03bd = 0.\n\n(6)\n\nIn what follows, we will denote the magnitudes related with general relativity with an over \"\u25e6\".\n\u25e6\nFor example, the Ricci coefficient of rotation will be denoted by AC A\u03bd , whereas its curvature\n\u25e6\nwill be \u03a9A B\u03bc\u03bd .\n\n2.2\n\nOrdinary Palatini Formulation\n\nThe basic gravitational variables in the Palatini framework is the pair (h\u03bc , A\u03bc ) of independent\n1-form fields. As is well known, the tetrad field provides an isomorphism between the tangent\nspace M = Tx R at each x\u03bc and the algebra of the translation group, which is also a vector\nspace equipped with the metric \u03b7AB . It establishes, therefore, a relation between \u03b7AB and the\nspacetime metric g\u03bc\u03bd :\n(7)\ng\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b7AB hA \u03bc hB \u03bd .\nIn the specific case of general relativity, the action of the gravitational field in the Palatini\nformulation can be written in the form\nZ\n\u25e6\n1\n(8)\n\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 \u01ebABCD hA \u03bc hB \u03bd \u03a9CD \u03c1\u03c3 ,\nSP = 2\n4k R\nwhere k2 = 8\u03c0G/c4 , \u01ebABCD is the totally anti-symmetric Levi\u2013Civita tensor on M compatible\nwith \u03b7AB , and\n(9)\n\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 = hA \u03bc hB \u03bd hC \u03c1 hD \u03c3 \u01ebABCD ,\nwith \u01eb0123 = h \u2261 det(hA \u03bc ). In contrast to the usual Einstein\u2013Hilbert action, SP depends on\ntwo independent variables. Variation of SP with respect to the (inverse) tetrad hA \u03bc yields\nEinstein's equation\n\u25e6\n\u25e6A\n(10)\n\u03a9 \u03bc \u2212 12 hA \u03bc \u03a9 = 0,\n\u25e6\n\nwhereas variation with respect to the spin connection AA B\u03bc yields\n\u25e6\n\n\u2202\u03bc hA \u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd hA \u03bc + [A\u03bc , h\u03bd ]A = 0,\n\n(11)\n\nwhich is a constraint equation determining the vanishing of torsion. It is then usually assumed\n\u25e6\nthat Eq. (11) can be solved for AA B\u03bc , in which case it becomes completely determined by\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\nthe tetrad: A\u03bc = A\u03bc (h\u03bd ). A further restriction to histories in which the connection is so\ndetermined reduces SP to the ordinary Einstein\u2013Hilbert action of general relativity,\n\u25e6\n\nSEH \u2261 SP (h\u03bd , A\u03bc (h\u03bd )) =\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\nwhere R is the scalar curvature of A\u03bc = A\u03bc (h\u03bd ).\n3\n\n1\n2k2\n\nZ\n\nR\n\n\u25e6\n\nd4 x h R,\n\n(12)\n\n\f2.3\n\nModifying the Palatini Formulation\n\nThe above procedure is not consistent with a genuine connection-based theory for gravitation,\nsince in such a theory the connection is to be considered as a fundamental, and not a derived\n\u25e6\nfield like A\u03bc (h\u03bd ). If we really want to obtain a formulation for gravity which is closer to a Yang\u2013\nMills theory, the spin connection is to be considered as a fundamental field, and accordingly the\n\u25e6\nfield equation (11) must be solved for the coframe h\u03bd , and not for the connection A\u03bc . In other\n\u25e6\n\nwords, the coframe is to be completely determined by the connection: h\u03bd = h\u03bd (A\u03bc ). Of course,\nas far as the theory is kept metric compatible, and torsion is assumed to vanish, the resulting\ntheory is the same as general relativity, though written in a different set of field\u2013coordinates.\nIn this case, however, a restriction to histories on which the coframe is determined in terms of\n\u25e6\nthe spin connection A\u03bc does not reduce SP to the Einstein\u2013Hilbert action. It leads, actually,\nto a modified version of the Palatini action, which we indicate as\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\nS \u2032 P \u2261 SP (h\u03bd (A\u03bc ), A\u03bc ).\n\n(13)\n\nAlthough presenting the same dynamics, the resulting theory will have different features in\nrelation to general relativity. For example, the spacetime connection\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u0393\u03c1 \u03bc\u03bd = hA \u03c1 \u2202\u03bd hA \u03bc + hA \u03c1 AA B\u03bd hB \u03bc ,\n\n(14)\n\ndespite presenting zero torsion, will never, in this formulation, be written in terms of the\nmetric or the tetrad. The crucial point of this modified Palatini formulation is then to solve\n\u25e6\nthe constraint equation (11) for hA \u03bc in terms of the spin connection AA B\u03bc . As we are going\nto see next, the requirement of local Lorentz covariance naturally yields such a solution.\n\n3\n\nLorentz Transformations\n\nLet us review some basic properties of the Lorentz transformations. Denoting the Cartesian\nMinkowski coordinates by {xA }, the most general form of the generators of infinitesimal Lorentz\ntransformations is [8]\nJAB = LAB + SAB ,\n(15)\nwhere\nLAB = i(xA \u2202B \u2212 xB \u2202A )\n\n(16)\n\nis the orbital part of the generators, and Sab is the spin part of the generators, whose explicit\nform depends on the spin of the representation. The generators JAB satisfy the commutation\nrelation\n[JAB , JCD ] = i (\u03b7BC JAD \u2212 \u03b7AC JBD \u2212 \u03b7BD JAC + \u03b7AD JBC ) ,\n(17)\nwhich is to be identified with the Lie algebra of the Lorentz group. Each set of generators LAB\nand SAB satisfies the same commutation relation as JAB , and these sets commute with each\nother.\n\n4\n\n\fA local-that is, position dependent-infinitesimal Lorentz transformation of Minkowski\nspace coordinates is usually written with the orbital generators,\n\u03b4L xA = \u2212 2i \u01ebCD LCD xA \u2261 \u2212\u01ebA D xD ,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere \u01ebCD \u2261 \u01ebCD (x\u03bc ) is the parameter of the transformation. Now, due to the transitivity of\nMinkowski spacetime under translations, every two points related by a Lorentz transformation\ncan be also related by a translation (though the converse is not true). In fact, by using the\nexplicit form of LCD , the transformation (18) can be rewritten as\n\u03b4L xA = \u2212i \u03be C PC xA ,\n\n(19)\n\n\u03be C = \u01eb C D xD\n\n(20)\n\nwhich is a translation with\nas parameter, and PC = \u2212i \u2202C as generator. This means essentially that an infinitesimal\nLorentz transformation of the Minkowski coordinates is formally equivalent to a translation\nwith \u03be C as parameters.\nOn the other hand, because the coordinates xA behave collectively as a vector under Lorentz\ntransformations, we can interpret their set {xA (x\u03bc )} as a vector field. In this case, the Lorentz\ngenerators are those of the (spin) vector representation [8],\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n(SCD )A B = i \u03b4C A \u03b7DB \u2212 \u03b4D A \u03b7CB ,\n\n(21)\n\n\u03b4S xA = \u2212 2i \u01ebCD (SCD )A B xB \u2261 \u01ebA D xD .\n\n(22)\n\nwhich yields\nTherefore, we see that a Lorentz transformation of the Minkowski coordinates written with\nthe complete generators JCD vanishes identically:\n\u03b4J xA \u2261 \u2212 2i \u01ebCD JCD xA = 0.\n\n(23)\n\nOf course, the generators are defined up to a sign. However, provided Lab and Sab are chosen\nin such a way to satisfy the same commutation relation, they yield opposite Lorentz transformations, and consequently a vanishing total Lorentz transformation. This result-quite\nconsistent by itself-comes from the fact that, concomitant with the Lorentz transformation\n(22) in its vector indices, a vector field V A (x), for example, necessarily undergoes the Lorentz\ntransformation (18) in its arguments, yielding a fixed point transformation:\n\u03b4V A (x) \u2261 V \u2032A (x) \u2212 V A (x) = \u2212 2i \u01ebCD JCD V A (x).\n\n(24)\n\nIn the case of the coordinate itself, which is a Lorentz vector field, both transformations cancel\neach other, yielding a vanishing net result. For all other fields, JAB generates a Lorentz\ntransformation at a fixed spacetime point, or equivalently, the change in the functional form\nof the field.\n\n5\n\n\f4\n\nLorentz Covariant Derivative and Coupling Prescription\n\nLet us consider now a general matter field \u03a8(x\u03bc ), which is a function of the spacetime coordinates {x\u03bc }. When considering the gravitational interaction, like in any gauge theory, the\nrelevant transformation is that associated with the change in the functional form of the field.\nThese transformations, as is well known, are generated by JAB [8]:\n\u03b4J \u03a8 \u2261 \u03a8\u2032 (x) \u2212 \u03a8(x) = \u2212\n\ni AB\nJAB \u03a8(x).\n2\u01eb\n\n(25)\n\nThe explicit form of LAB is the same for all fields, whereas that of SAB depends on the Lorentz\nrepresentation \u03a8 belongs to. Notice that the orbital generators LAB are able to act on the\nspacetime argument of \u03a8(x\u03bc ), due to the relations\n\u2202A = (\u2202A x\u03bc ) \u2202\u03bc\n\n\u2202\u03bc = (\u2202\u03bc xA ) \u2202A .\n\nand\n\nBy using the explicit form of LAB , the Lorentz transformation (25) can be rewritten in the\nform\n(26)\n\u03b4J \u03a8 = \u2212i\u03be C PC \u03a8 \u2212 2i \u01ebAB SAB \u03a8,\nwith \u03be C given by Eq. (20). Again, we see that the orbital part of the transformation reduces to\na translation, and consequently the Lorentz transformation of a general field \u03a8 can be rewritten\nas a \"translation\" plus a pure spin transformation. Despite presenting such a particular form,\nit is important to notice that, because [PC , SAB ] = 0, it is not a Poincar\u00e9, but a genuine\nLorentz transformation.\nIn a connection-based approach to general relativity, the fundamental field representing\n\u25e6\ngravitation is the spin connection A\u03bc . Accordingly, the Lorentz covariant derivative of the\nmatter field \u03a8, that is, the derivative which is covariant under the Lorentz transformations\ngenerated by the JAB 's is [9]\n\u25e6AB\n\n\u25e6\n\nD C \u03a8 = \u2202C \u03a8 + 21 A\n\u25e6\n\nC\n\n\u03b4J \u03a8\n,\n\u03b4\u01ebAB\n\n(27)\n\n\u25e6\n\nwhere AAB C = AAB \u03bc hC \u03bc . Substituting the transformation (25), it becomes\n\u25e6\n\nD C \u03a8 = \u2202C \u03a8 \u2212\nUsing the identity\ni\n2\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\nAAB \u03bc JAB =\n\ni\n2\n\ni\n2\n\n\u25e6\n\nAAB C JAB \u03a8.\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\nAAB \u03bc SAB + B A \u03bc PA ,\n\n(28)\n\n(29)\n\n\u25e6\n\nwhere B A \u03bc \u2261 AA B\u03bc xB , the covariant derivative (28) can be rewritten in the form\n\u25e6\n\n\u03bc \u25e6\n\nD C \u03a8 = hC D \u03bc \u03a8,\nwhere\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\nAB\nD \u03bc = \u2202\u03bc \u2212 2i A \u03bc SAB\n\n6\n\n(30)\n(31)\n\n\fis the usual Fock\u2013Ivanenko covariant derivative operator [10], and hC \u03bc is the inverse of the\ntetrad [5]\n\u25e6\n\nhC \u03bc = \u2202\u03bc xC + AC D\u03bc xD .\n\n(32)\n\nOur initial contention, that the tetrad field should be a derived quantity written in terms of\nthe spin connection AC D\u03bc , is in this way vindicated.\nOn account of the above results, the coupling of a general matter field to gravitation can\nthen be accomplished by replacing all ordinary by covariant derivatives:\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u2202C \u2192 D C \u2261 hC \u03bc D \u03bc .\n\n(33)\n\nThe gravitational coupling prescription, therefore, is composed of two parts. The Fock\u2013\nIvanenko derivative accounts for the coupling of the spin of the matter field to gravitation.\nThis coupling is not universal as it depends on the spin content of the matter field. On\nthe other hand, the tetrad, which appears in the coupling prescription multiplying the FockIvanenko derivative, accounts for the coupling of the energy and momentum of the matter field\nto gravitation. This part of the coupling prescription is universal in the sense that all fields\nin Nature will respond equally to its action. As the nontrivial part of the tetrad comes from\nthe orbital Lorentz generators, we can say that these generators are the responsible for the\nuniversality of the gravitational interaction.\n\n5\n\nConnection and Tetrad Transformations\n\nA general element of the Lorentz group is written as\ni\n\nh\n\nUJ = UL US = US UL \u2261 exp \u2212 2i \u01ebAB JAB ,\nwith\n\nh\n\nUS = exp \u2212 2i \u01ebAB SAB\n\ni\n\nand\n\nh\n\n(34)\ni\n\nUL = exp \u2212 2i \u01ebAB LAB .\n\n(35)\n\nBy construction, under a local Lorentz transformation generated by UJ , the gauge covariant\nderivative (30) transforms according to\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\nD\u2032C \u2032 \u03a8\u2032 (x) = UJ D C \u03a8(x).\n\n(36)\n\u25e6\n\nNotice that, in addition to the Lorentz rotation in the matrix (spin) indices of D C , which is the\nonly transformation occurring in (internal) Yang-Mills theories, in the case of the (external)\n\u25e6\n\nLorentz gauge group the spacetime index of D C is also necessarily transformed. Using the\nexpressions [8]\n\u03a8(x) = US\u22121 \u03a8\u2032 (x\u2032 ) and \u03a8\u2032 (x) = UL \u03a8\u2032 (x\u2032 )\nin the transformation (36), it acquires the form\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\nUL\u22121 D\u2032C \u2032 UL = hC \u03bc US D\u03bc US\u22121 .\n7\n\n(37)\n\n\f\u25e6\n\nNow, the Fock\u2013Ivanenko derivative D\u03bc is defined by\n\u25e6\n\n1\n2\n\nD \u03bc \u03a8 = \u2202\u03bc \u03a8 +\n\n\u25e6\n\nAAB \u03bc\n\n\u03b4S \u03a8\n,\n\u03b4\u01ebAB\n\nwhere\n\u03b4S \u03a8 \u2261 \u03a8\u2032 (x\u2032 ) \u2212 \u03a8(x) = \u2212 2i \u01ebAB SAB \u03a8\n\n(38)\n\nis the total change in \u03a8(x). It transforms, consequently, as\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u22121\n\u2032\nD \u03bc = US D\u03bc US ,\n\n(39)\n\nfrom where we can obtain the typical connection gauge transformation\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u2032\n\u22121\n\u22121\nA\u03bc = US A\u03bc US + iUS \u2202\u03bc US .\n\n(40)\n\nIts infinitesimal version is given by\n\u0012\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u0013\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u03b4S ACD \u03bc = \u2212 \u2202\u03bc \u01ebCD + AC A\u03bc \u01ebAD + AD A\u03bc \u01ebCA \u2261 \u2212D \u03bc \u01ebCD .\n\n(41)\n\nWe see in this way that the Lorentz gauge transformations are generated by the spin (matrix)\npart of the representation, that is, by the generators SAB .\nLet us then return to the transformation law (37). Substituting Eq. (39), it becomes\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\nUL\u22121 D \u2032C \u2032 UL = hC \u03bc D \u2032\u03bc \u2261 D \u2032C .\n\n(42)\n\nIt is clear from this expression that the orbital part of the generators are responsible for the\n\u25e6\nLorentz transformation in the spacetime index of the covariant derivative D C . In fact, denoting\n\u2032\n\u2032\nby \u039bA C \u2261 (US )A C the element of the Lorentz group in the vector representation, the tetrad\ntransformation can be written in the usual form\n\u2032\n\nhC \u03bc = \u039bA C hA\u2032 \u03bc ,\nand we easily see that\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u22121\nA\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nD C \u2032 = \u039bC \u2032 DA \u2261 UL D C UL .\n\n(43)\n\nThe transformation law of the covariant derivative can then be written as\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u22121\nA\n\u2032\nDC \u2032 = \u039bC \u2032 US D A US .\n\n(44)\n\nIt is important to observe the different roles played by each one of the Lorentz generators:\nwhereas the spin part SAB generates the (internal) Lorentz gauge transformation, the orbital\npart LAB is responsible for transformation of the (external) spacetime index of the covariant\nderivative.\nLet us obtain now the infinitesimal Lorentz transformation of the tetrad field (32). The\ntransformation generated by SAB corresponds to the total change in the tetrad, that is, \u03b4S hA \u03bc \u2261\nh\u2032A \u03bc (x\u2032 ) \u2212 hA \u03bc (x). From Eq. (32) we see that\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u03b4S hA \u03bc = \u2202\u03bc (\u03b4S xA ) + (\u03b4S AA d\u03bc ) xD + AA D\u03bc (\u03b4S xD ).\n8\n\n(45)\n\n\fUsing Eqs. (22) and (41), it is easy to see that\n\u03b4S hA \u03bc = \u01ebA C hC \u03bc \u2261 \u2212 2i \u01ebCD (SCD )A B hB \u03bc ,\n\n(46)\n\nas it should be, since hA \u03bc is a Lorentz vector field in the algebraic index. On the other hand,\nthe transformation generated by LCD corresponds to a change in the coordinate only, that is,\n\u25e6\n\u03b4L hA \u03bc \u2261 hA \u03bc (x\u2032 ) \u2212 hA \u03bc (x). Since ACD \u03bc responds only to the spin representation SCD , we see\nfrom Eq. (32) that\n\u25e6\n\n\u03b4L hA \u03bc = \u2202\u03bc (\u03b4L xA ) + AA D\u03bc (\u03b4L xD ).\n\n(47)\n\nUsing the transformation (19), we get\n\u25e6\n\n\u03b4L hA \u03bc = \u2212D\u03bc \u03be A .\n\n(48)\n\nIt is then easy to see that \u03b4L hA \u03bc induces on the metric tensor (7) the transformation\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u03b4L g\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212\u2207\u03bc \u03be\u03bd \u2212 \u2207\u03bd \u03be\u03bc ,\n\n(49)\n\n\u25e6\n\nwhere \u03be\u03bd = \u03beA hA \u03bd , and \u2207\u03bc is the covariant derivative in the spacetime connection (14).\nAs is well known, this equation represents the response of g\u03bc\u03bd to spacetime diffeomorphisms\nx\u2032\u03bc = x\u03bc + \u03be \u03bc (x) [11]. In other words, the Lorentz transformations generated by LAB are\nequivalent to a spacetime general coordinate transformation. This means essentially that the\nordinary formulation of general relativity is included as a particular case of this more general\napproach, which allows from the very beginning the inclusion of both integer and half-integer\nspin fields. Furthermore, we see that the energy-momentum tensor of any matter field must\nfollow, through Noether's theorem [12], from the invariance of the corresponding Lagrangian\nunder a Lorentz transformation generated by the orbital generators only [13].\nConcerning this last point, it is interesting to notice the following property. Usually, the\nfunctional derivative of a matter field lagrangian L in relation to the spin connection gives the\nspin tensor. However, due to the dependence of the tetrad on the spin connection,\nJ \u03bc AB =\n\n1 \u03b4L\nh \u03b4A\u25e6AB\n\u03bc\n\n(50)\n\nwill represent now the total angular momentum, that is, spin plus orbital. In fact, as the tetrad\ndepends on the spin connection, the above expression can be rewritten in the form\n1 \u03b4L \u03b4hC \u03c1\n.\nh \u03b4hC \u03c1 \u03b4A\u25e6AB\n\u03bc\n\n(51)\n\n= \u03b4\u03bc \u03c1 (\u03b4C A xB \u2212 \u03b4C B xA ).\n\n(52)\n\nJ \u03bc AB =\nHowever, from Eq. (32) we see that\n\u03b4hC \u03c1\n\u25e6\n\n\u03b4A\n\nAB\n\n\u03bc\n\n9\n\n\fSubstituting this relation in Eq. (51), we get\nJ \u03bc AB = xA \u0398\u03bc B \u2212 xB \u0398\u03bc A ,\nwhere\n\u0398\u03bc A = \u2212\n\n1 \u03b4L\nh \u03b4hA \u03bc\n\n(53)\n\n(54)\n\nis the so called dynamical energy-momentum tensor. As far as L is local Lorentz invariant,\n\u0398\u03bc\u03bd = \u0398\u03bc A hA\u03bd will be the symmetric energy\u2013momentum tensor (see Ref. [14], page 371), and\nJ \u03bc AB will represent the total angular momentum tensor [15].\n\n6\n6.1\n\nThe Tangent-Space Coordinates as a Vector Field\nGeneral Properties\n\nAs we have seen, the Minkowski coordinates xA can be interpreted both as a set of four scalar\nfunctions-in which case its Lorentz transformation is that generated by the orbital generators\nLAB -and as a vector field xA (x\u03bc ), in which case its Lorentz transformation is that generated\nby the vector representation SAB . When we consider it as a vector field, its Fock\u2013Ivanenko\ncovariant derivative\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u03b4S xC\n(55)\nD\u03bc xC = \u2202\u03bc xC + 12 AAB \u03bc AB\n\u03b4\u01eb\nturns out to be, through the use of the transformation (22),\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\nD \u03bc xC = \u2202\u03bc xC + AC B\u03bc xB \u2261 hC \u03bc .\n\n(56)\n\nThis is to say that the Fock\u2013Ivanenko covariant derivative of the vector field xC (x\u03bc ) exactly\ncoincides with the tetrad field. We can consequently conclude, taking into account the usual\n\u25e6\nconcepts underlying the minimal coupling prescription, that the gravitational field AC D\u03bc couples to the Minkowski tangent space coordinates, that is, to the vector field xA , and that the\ncorresponding coupling constant is equal to 1. On their side, the coordinates {xA } respond to\nthe Lorentz gauge interaction. This is an essential point: it is this coupling the responsible\nfor the non\u2013triviality of the tetrad, that is, for its deviation from an exact differential form.\nA trivial, exact tetrad would represent a mere coordinate transformation, and not a gravitational field. By the standard expression g\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b7AB hA \u03bc hB \u03bd , therefore, it would give simply\nthe Minkowski metric written in arbitrary coordinates, with vanishing Riemannian curvature.\nIt is the coordinate\u2013connection coupling, with the ensuing tetrad non-triviality, that leads to\nthe non-trivial Riemannian metric on which the general relativity description of gravitation\nis based. We can say, therefore, that the very foundation of that description is the coupling\nbetween the spin connection and the tangent space coordinates. In addition, since the non\u25e6\n\u25e6\ntrivial part B A \u03bc = AA B\u03bc xB of the tetrad field comes from the orbital part of the Lorentz\ngenerators (see Eq. (29)), and as its action takes place on the arguments of every field, the\norbital generators LAB appear as the responsible for the universality of gravitation.\n\n10\n\n\f6.2\n\nModified Palatini Action\n\nUsing the fact that the tetrad is the covariant derivative of the tangent space coordinates, as\ngiven by Eq. (56), the modified action functional of the gravitational field can be rewritten in\nthe form\nZ\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n1\n\u2032\nSP = 2\n(57)\n\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 \u01ebABCD D\u03bc xA D \u03bd xB \u03a9CD \u03c1\u03c3 .\n4k R\nVariation of SP\u2032 in relation to the spin connection AAB \u03bc yields, up to a factor of xA , Einstein's\nequation. Now, using the tetrad (56), as well as expression (2) for the specific case of the Ricci\ncoefficient of rotation, the constraint equation (11) acquires the form\n\u25e6A\n\nT\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u2261 \u03a9A B\u03bc\u03bd xB = 0.\n\n(58)\n\nIn a sense, torsion appears as a measure of the non-orthogonality between curvature and\nthe Minkowski coordinate field. When torsion vanishes, like in general relativity, curvature\nbecomes orthogonal to xA .\nOn the other hand, as a consequence of the above described coupling between the spin\n\u25e6\nconnection AA B\u03bc and the coordinates xA , the gravitational action results to depend also on\nthe vector field xA . It is then interesting to observe that a variation of (57) in relation to xA\nyields\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\u03bc\n\n\u2207\u03bc \u03a9\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u2212 12 \u03b4\u03bc \u03bd \u03a9 = 0,\n\n(59)\n\nwhich is the contracted form of the curvature Bianchi identity of general relativity.\n\n6.3\n\nLagrangian of the Tangent-Space Coordinates\n\nNow, if the coordinate xa (x\u03bc ) is considered to be a vector field, it must have a Lagrangian\ndensity. Assuming that it is massless, the natural lagrangian for a vector field on a Riemannian\nmanifold, and responding to a gauge interaction, is\nLx = \u2212\u01eb\u039b\n\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\nh\n\u03b7CD \u03b7 AB DA xC D B xD ,\n2\n\n(60)\n\nwhere \u01eb\u039b is a positive constant with dimension of energy density, introduced to give the Lagrangian the appropriate dimension. Using that\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\nDA xC = h\u03bc A D \u03bc xC \u2261 hA \u03bc hC \u03bc = \u03b4A C ,\n\n(61)\n\nwhich follows from the orthogonality properties hA \u03bc hA \u03bd = \u03b4\u03bc \u03bd and hA \u03bc hB \u03bc = \u03b4A B , we find\nLx = \u22122 h \u01eb\u039b .\n\n(62)\n\nThe Lagrangian of the vector field xA , therefore, corresponds to a cosmological term for the\ngravitational field equations, with\n16\u03c0G\n\u01eb\u039b\n(63)\n\u039b=\nc3\n11\n\n\fplaying the role of cosmological constant. In other words, a cosmological term is nothing but\na Lagrangian for the tangent space coordinates, seen as a vector field. This result provides\na new interpretation for the origin of the dark energy of the universe [16], which would then\ncome from considering the tangent-space coordinates as a vector field. Observe that the value\nof \u039b does not depend on the gravitational field, and is left as a free parameter. In fact,\neven in the absence of gravitation, where the tetrads become trivial, provided the tangentspace coordinates are considered as a vector field, its Lagrangian will always give rise to a\ncosmological term.\n\n7\n\nFinal Remarks\n\nWhen general relativity is conceived as a genuine Lorentz-valued connection theory, the local\nLorentz group emerges as the kinematic symmetry behind gravitation, and the Ricci coefficient\n\u25e6\nof rotation AC D\u03bc , the spin connection of general relativity, becomes the fundamental field\ndescribing gravitation. In this theory, a tetrad given by the Fock-Ivanenko covariant derivative\nof the tangent space coordinates,\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\nhC \u03bc \u2261 D\u03bc xC = \u2202\u03bc xC + AC B\u03bc xB ,\n\n(64)\n\nshows up naturally. Since it depends on the spin connection, it is not a fundamental but a\nderived field, as it should be in a true connection-based theory. A fundamental consequence\nof this approach refers to the Bianchi identities. To see that, it is important to observe\nthat absence of torsion, as in Yang\u2013Mills theories, is completely different from a present, but\nvanishing torsion, as in general relativity. This difference is revealed by the fact that, whereas\nin Yang\u2013Mills theories there is only one Bianchi identity, in general relativity there are two:\none for torsion, given by\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n(65)\n\u03a9A \u03c1\u03bc\u03bd + \u03a9A \u03bd\u03c1\u03bc + \u03a9A \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 = 0,\nand one for curvature, which reads\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6A\n\nD\u03c1 \u03a9\n\n\u25e6\n\nB\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\n+ D \u03bd \u03a9A B\u03c1\u03bc + D \u03bc \u03a9A B\u03bd\u03c1 = 0.\n\n(66)\n\nMultiplying the curvature Bianchi identity (66) by xB , and using the identity (58), the result is\neasily seen to be the torsion Bianchi identity (65). According to this approach, therefore, similarly to the Yang\u2013Mills theories, general relativity turns out to present only one independent\nBianchi identity.\nIt is interesting to observe that, even in a general case, characterized by the simultaneous\npresence of curvature and torsion, the two Bianchi identities are also reduced to a single one.\nIn this case, torsion satisfies the relation\nT A \u03bc\u03bd \u2261 \u03a9A B\u03bc\u03bd xB ,\n\n(67)\n\nand is consequently always orthogonal to xA :\nxA T A \u03bc\u03bd = 0.\n12\n\n(68)\n\n\fNow, in this general case, the two Bianchi identities [17] can be written in the form\nD\u03c1 T A \u03bc\u03bd + D\u03bd T A \u03c1\u03bc + D\u03bc T A \u03bd\u03c1 = \u03a9A \u03c1\u03bc\u03bd + \u03a9A \u03bd\u03c1\u03bc + \u03a9A \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\n\n(69)\n\nD\u03c1 \u03a9A B\u03bc\u03bd + D\u03bd \u03a9A B\u03c1\u03bc + D\u03bc \u03a9A B\u03bd\u03c1 = 0.\n\n(70)\n\nand\nxB ,\n\nAs before, multiplying the curvature Bianchi identity (70) by\nand using the relation (67),\nthe result will be the torsion Bianchi identity (69).\nSumming up, we can say that, when the fundamental field of gravitation is assumed to be\nthe spin connection, the two Bianchi identities of gravitation are reduced to a single one. This\nresult may be interpreted as an indication that, according to this approach, curvature and\ntorsion might be equivalent ways of describing the gravitational field, and consequently related\nwith the same degrees of freedom of gravity [18]. In this case, gravitation becomes closer to the\nYang\u2013Mills theories which, as already pointed out, have only one Bianchi identity. Whether the\nsuccessful canonical quantization techniques of the Yang-Mills theories will become applicable\nto such a theory is an open question yet to be explored.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank V.
