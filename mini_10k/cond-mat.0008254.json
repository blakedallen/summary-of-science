The latter occurs when\nfinite lifetime non-chaotic structures, called \"solitons\", dominate the dynamics. We illustrate this\nscenario in an extension of the deterministic Chat\u00e9\u2013Manneville coupled map lattice model and in a\nsoliton including variant of the stochastic Domany-Kinzel cellular automaton.\nPACS numbers: 05.45.+b, 05.70.Fh, 47.27.Cn\n\nThe nature of transitions in extended deterministic\ndynamical systems is not very well understood. Since\nfew analytical methods are available for such systems,\nit is tempting to map them to stochastic models [1].\nIn a study of the deterministic \"damped Kuramoto\u2013\nSivashinsky equation\" [2], Chat\u00e9 and Manneville [3] introduced the notion of a universal transition to turbulence via \"spatio-temporal intermittency\" [4,5]. Pomeau\ngave general arguments [6] for this transition to be in\nthe universality class of Directed Percolation (DP) [7,8].\nThese arguments rested on earlier work by Grassberger\n[9] and Janssen [10], who conjectured that any stochastic\nprocess with a unique absorbing state should be in the\nclass of DP. To check whether deterministic models could\nbe in the DP class, Chat\u00e9 and Manneville introduced a\nvery simple coupled map lattice (CML), with the local\nmap either performing \"laminar\" or chaotic motion.\nSurprisingly, the critical exponents of this CML were\nnot those of DP [11]; in fact they appeared to vary continuously along the critical line. Grassberger and Schreiber\n[12] pointed out that the presence of long lived \"solitons\" (local excitations that propagate with unit velocity through the lattice, see Fig 1b-c and [12]) may\nlead to long crossover times, and conjectured that the\ntrue asymptotic behavior of the Chat\u00e9-Manneville model\nwould be in the DP universality class.\nOur central claim is that even solitons with a finite lifetime can completely change the nature of the transition.\nWe base this claim on studies of extensions of (i) the\nChat\u00e9-Manneville model [3] and (ii) the Domany-Kinzel\nstochastic cellular automaton [13], where both extensions\nfacilitate the tuning of solitonic properties. In the regime\nof short soliton lifetimes the bulk exponents of our CML\nare consistent with DP; the spreading exponents indicate\nthat the CML falls in the universality class of DP with\ninfinitely many absorbing states. For both our CML and\nour stochastic model the transition between active and\ninactive states looses its continuous nature and appears\nto become first order for large soliton lifetimes. We shall\nargue that this discontinuity emerges because pairs of\n\n103 (a)\nn\n\n103 (b)\nn\n\n1\n1\n\n1\ni 500 1\n\n103 (c)\nn\n\n1\ni 500 1\n\ni 500\n\nFIG. 1. Spacetime plots of our coupled map lattice (2) -(3)\nwhere inactive (chaotic) sites are white (black) for r = 3 near\ncriticality, illustrating the increasing role of solitons as function of our parameter b: (a) b = 0.2, \u03b5 = 0.373. (b) b = 0,\n(Chat\u00e9-Manneville) \u03b5 = 0.357. (c) b = \u22120.1, \u03b5 = 0.352.\n\nsolitons can generate new activity upon collisions (see\nFig. 1c and Fig. 4a) while individual solitons do not lead\nto new turbulent activity. We study this phenomenon in\ndetail in our stochastic cellular automaton and show that\nthe non-universality seen in earlier work is likely due to\nthe proximity of this (quasi) first order transition: our\nstochastic model shows transient behaviour which can\nbe fitted quite convincingly to non-universal power laws.\nHere we focus on the broad picture; a detailed study will\nbe presented elsewhere [14].\nCoupled Map Lattice \u2013 The model introduced by\nChat\u00e9 and Manneville [11] is a 1D coupled map lattice\n\u03b5\nui (n + 1) = f (ui (n)) + \u2206f ui (n) ,\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u2206f ui (n) = f (ui\u22121 (n)) \u2212 2f (ui (n)) + f (ui+1 (n)).\nWhen u \u2264 1, f is a standard tent map of the form\nf (u) = r( 12 \u2212 |u \u2212 21 |) and u displays chaotic behavior,\nwhile when u \u2265 1, f is simply the identity and u displays\nlaminar behavior. States in which all sites are laminar remain so, but chaotic sites can \"infect\" their neighbors due\nto the spatial coupling. The effectiveness of this spreading of the chaos depends on r and \u03b5. Taking the density\nof chaotic sites or \"activity\" m as an order parameter,\ntransitions from a \"laminar\" state (in which m decays\nto zero) to a \"turbulent\" state (where m reaches a finite\nvalue in an infinite system) can be defined.

The values for DP (last row) are taken from [18].\n\nsuch CML's to physical systems of weakly coupled\nchaotic elements, we must interpret the map f as a return map on a Poincar\u00e9 section; each local map should\ntherefore be at least two dimensional and invertible [15].\nWe thus introduce the CML\n\u03b5\n(2)\nui (n + 1) = f (ui (n)) + \u2206f ui (n) + vi (n)\n2\nvi (n + 1) = b(ui (n + 1) \u2212 ui (n))\n(3)\n\nabsorbing state. At the critical point \u03b5 = \u03b5c (r), this time\ndiverges like \u03c4 (\u03b5c , L) \u223c Lz where the usual dynamical\nexponent z = \u03bdk /\u03bd\u22a5 has been introduced. The order parameter m(\u03b5, L, t) is the fraction of chaotic sites in the\nlattice, again averaged over many different initial states.\nThe scaling of the order parameter, m \u223c (\u03b5 \u2212 \u03b5c )\u03b2 for\n\u03b5 \u2192 \u03b5+\nc defines the critical exponent \u03b2. Precisely at the\ncritical point the order parameter decays as m(\u03b5c , t, L) \u223c\nL\u2212\u03b2/\u03bd\u22a5 g(t/Lz ). For t \u226a Lz this behavior should be independent of L and m(\u03b5c , t, L) \u223c t\u2212\u03b8 with \u03b8 = \u03b2/\u03bdk .\nTable 1 shows the exponents z and \u03b8 as function of b for\nr = 3. These values where obtained for systemsizes up\nto L = 2048 (128 realizations) [14]. There are apparently\nregimes for |b| > 0.1 where the exponents are very close\nto their DP values.\nSpreading Properties of our CML \u2013 Instead of following the decay of an initially uniformely filled system, one\ncan also determine critical exponents from the spreading\nof an initial seed of turbulence in an otherwise laminar\nconfiguration [19]. These so-called dynamical exponents\nare defined in terms of the number of chaotic sites N (t),\nthe survival probability P (t), the mean-squared deviation\nR2 (t) from the origin of the turbulent activity and the\ndensity n(t) of chaotic sites within the spreading patch\nof turbulence. Thus we assume\n\nwhere f is the same as before and the new parameter\nb is the Jacobian of the local map at each site; this\nmap is invertible for any non-zero b and becomes increasingly two-dimensional with |b|. This design is analogous to the construction of the H\u00e9non map [16] from\nthe logistic map, except that on the right hand side\nb(ui (n + 1)\u2212ui (n)) appears instead of bui (n). This ensures that the absorbing state fixed points ui (n) = u\u2217\nof the old CML (1) are mapped to the laminar fixed\npoint (ui (n), vi (n)) = (u\u2217 , 0). The model is updated\nsynchronously and typical dynamical states are shown\nin Fig. 1; in what follows we will fix the parameter r = 3.\nTo get a feeling for the location and nature of the transition we show in Fig. 2a the activity after 1000 timesteps as a function of b and \u03b5; the active and inactive\nphases can be clearly distinguished. In Fig. 2b we show\nthat when b is varied, there is a qualitative difference in\nthe activity as a function of \u03b5. The behavior for b = 0\nis consistent with a continuous transition, whereas for\nb = \u22120.1 a marked steepening occurs consistent with the\nemergence of a discontinuity; further support for this\ncomes from a study of the correlation function which\nshows a finite correlation length at the transition [14].\nIn Fig. 2c we show the sharpening of this discontinuity\nas function of the total integration time.\nCML near continuous transition \u2013 We focus now on\nthe soliton-poor regime where the transition appears to\nbe continuous. We have computed critical exponents using finite size scaling [1,17]. The critical line in the parameter plane (\u03b5, r) is located by measuring the \"absorption time\" \u03c4 (r, \u03b5, L), i.e., the average time it takes the\nsystem, starting from a random initial state, to reach the\n\nN (t) \u223c t\u03b7 P (t) \u223c t\u2212\u03b4 R2 (t) \u223c tzs n(t) \u223c t\u2212\u03b8s\n\n(4)\n\nFor DP one finds \u03b4 = \u03b8 = \u03b8s and zs = 2/z. In the Chat\u00e9Manneville model at r = 3 it is basically impossible to\ndetermine these exponents, since the spreading is completely dominated by the solitons (Fig. 3b). In our generalized CML it turns out to be possible to determine the\nspreading exponents (Fig. 3c) in the weak soliton regime.\nIn the CML the absorbing state is non-unique since any\nstate in which all u-values are above unity and all vvalues are not too large is absorbing. We indeed found\nthe dynamical exponents to depend on the configuration\n2\n\n\f2000 i\n\n1\n\n1000 n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n1\n\nof solitons. Pure DP corresponds to the equation \u010a =\nrC \u2212 uC 2 . These mean-field equations display both a\nfirst and second order transition, and the nature of the\ntransition is governed by z \u2261 (d/c)2 u; the change to first\norder behavior occurs at z = 1. If z > 1 (short soliton life\ntime) the solitons just renormalize u to u(1 \u2212 z1 ). When\nz < 1 the behavior for positive r (the active phase) is governed by the stable node at S2\u22c6 \u2248 a(z \u22121/2 \u22121). When r\nbecomes negative this fixed point remains stable and at a\nfinite distance away from the origin; simultaneously, the\ndr\norigin becomes attractive while a saddle at S = S1\u22c6 \u2248 z\u22121\nappears close to it. Initial conditions close to the origin\nwill flow there, but initial conditions above the saddle\nstable manifold will flow to the node. This will go on\nuntil (S1\u22c6 , C1\u22c6 ) and (S2\u22c6 , C2\u22c6 ) merge in a saddle-node bifurcation at r = rc (z) < 0 below which the origin becomes\nglobally attractive - clearly a first order scenario.\nActivity in first order regime \u2013 In Fig. 4b we show\nthe evolution of the activity m for our stochastic model\nin the soliton rich regime. There are two important features that can be extracted from this data: (i) For a\ntransient period that goes up to time 103 , it is possible\nto find values of p such that the decay of m appears to\nbe a powerlaw with a non-DP exponent. For the example shown, a reasonable scaling can be obtained over 2\ndecades. However, for this to be real asymptotic scaling,\none should be able to have this scaling extend to arbitrary large times; however the activity curves for sizes\n200, 2000 and 20000 precisely curve down at the same\ntime (Fig. 4c); hence there is no hope that increasing the\nsystemsize extends the time interval over which apparant\nscaling can be found. (ii) For long times the activity either decays rapidly, or first hits a plateaux. Clearly, for\nincreasing time the curve of m as function of p will make\na sharper and sharper jump, similar to what we found for\nthe CML. In the plateaux regime, the qualitative dynamics is as shown in Fig. 4a. We have also checked that for\np = 0.621 the same plateaux value is reached for initial\nactivities in the range from 1 to 0.1; for initial activities of 0.05 and smaller, there is an initial increase of the\nactivity but the plateaux is never reached [14].\nIt remains to be understood whether this solitonassisted turbulent state can persist forever and thus\nwhether the observed first order transition is a true thermodynamic transition. One can argue that below the DP\nthreshold (i.e., for negative r in (6)) the active state can\nbe destroyed by creating a sufficiently large laminar hole,\nso large that the solitons emitted from the edges cannot\npenetrate through it and collide to create turbulence [25].\nThus the motion of the edges of such a large \"droplet\"\nwould only be driven by the diffusion of the chaotic sites,\nwhich for negative r will cause the laminar region to expand. Something like this is observed for states close\nto but below the observed transition, where the activity\nremains almost constant for a long transient time after\nwhich it rapidly decays. We have not been able to\n\n(c)\n\n1000 n\n\n(b)\n\n1000 n\n\n(a)\n\n2000 i\n\n1\n\n2000 i\n\nFIG. 3.

This is consistent with recent studies of systems with infinite numbers of absorbing states [18,20\u201324]\nwhere it has been revealed that these differ from classical DP precisely in the non-universality of the spreading\nexponents. It has also been conjectured, and verified numerically [21,22], that the dynamical exponents satisfy\nthe hyperscaling relation \u03b7 + \u03b4 + \u03b8s = dzs /2 where d is\nthe spatial dimension. The spreading exponents depend\non the mean value of the field < u > in the laminar state\noutside of the seed. For the example shown in Fig. 3c,\nthe value of < u > which would result from a long run\nwith homogeneously random initial conditions is 1.235.\nEven a 2% variation in < u > creates a 100% variation\nof \u03b7 whereas \u2206 \u2261 zs /2 \u2212 (\u03b7 + \u03b4 + \u03b8s ) remains less than\n0.1 (for times up to 2000). Similarly, within this range \u03b4\nvaries between 0 and 0.5. For other parameter values \u03b7\nmay range from 0.8 to 0.1; for more details, see [14].\nFirst order behavior and Stochastic Model \u2013 The cause\nof the discontinuity in the activity in the soliton rich\nregime is illustrated in spacetime plots like Fig. 1c: while\nindividual turbulent patches clearly have a finite lifetime, new activity is created by collisions of the solitons\nthat surround the active patches. To illustrate this scenario, we extend the Domany-Kinzel cellular automaton\n[13] in the following way: (i) Our model contains two\nspecies representing the chaotic sites and the solitons.\n(ii) The chaotic sites behave like active sites in usual\nbond-directed DP, except that when they \"die\" they can\nemit a left or right-moving soliton with probability c.\n(iii) The solitons travel ballistically and die with a probability d. (iv) Individual solitons are seen by the chaotic\nsites as inactive. (v) Upon collision two solitons generate a chaotic site; this is the only way by which solitons\nenhance the activity. A typical spacetime plot of our\nmodel is shown in Fig. 4a, showing the same qualitative\nbehavior as the CML in the soliton rich regime: finite\nsize clusters of activity surrounded by clouds of solitons.\nMean field equations \u2013 The rate equations for our\nstochastic model are\n\u1e60 = cC \u2212 S 2 \u2212 dS\n\n(5)\n\n\u010a = rC + S 2 \u2212 uC 2\n\n(6)\n\nwhere C and S are the densities of chaotic sites and\n3\n\n\f103 (a)\n\n(b)\nm\n0.10\n\n[1] T.

For\nsmaller systemsizes the final fall-off occuring for large p seems\nmore gentle, but clearly the early time behavior and the value\nof the plateaux activity are insensitive to finite size effects.\n\ndetermine if this transient time actually diverges at the\napparent first order transition point (which would make\nit a bona fide phase transition). Such an investigation\nis difficult since for finite lattices the true asymptotic is\nalways the absorbing state.\nDiscussion The overall picture that emerges from our\nmodels is that the transition to spatio-temporal intermittency is strongly influenced by coherently traveling \"solitons\", which, even though they have a finite life time,\nchange the nature of the transition. Recent work [26]\nshowing that the transition in the damped KuramotoSivashinsky equation appears first order provides additional support for this scenario. Further support\ncomes indirectly from the finding [27] that the Chat\u00e9Manneville model yields critical behavior consistent with\nDP when it is driven asynchronously, which destroys\nthe solitons. We believe that our findings also explain\nthe nonuniversality observed in these systems, since our\nstochastic model shows transient behaviour which can be\nfitted convincingly to power laws that vary strongly with\nthe parameters [14]. In general our study highlights that\nit is far from trivial to decide which are the important degrees of freedom when mapping deterministic to stochastic behavior: apparantly innoculous structures may have\nan unexpected strong effect on the coarse grained dynamics and render the \"natural\", most simple stochastic\nmodels inapplicable.\nIt is a pleasure to thank Deepak Dhar, Martin Evans,\nGeoff Grinstein, Martin Howard and Kent Baekgaard\nLauritsen for valuable discussions.
