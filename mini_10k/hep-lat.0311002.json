At finite lattice spacing the differences between\nthe two formulations become rather dramatic near the chiral limit, but they get severely\nreduced, at the coupling considered, after a few smearing steps.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nRecently, the staggered action when coupled to \"HYPed\" backgrounds [1] has attracted renewed\ninterest. This is mainly due to the cheapness of this formulation which bears the promise that\nrealistic unquenched simulations can be performed with currently available resources [2]. Moreover, as a remnant of the full SU(Nf = d)A group, the continuous \"two-hop global\" symmetry\n\u0010\n\n\u03c7(x) \u2192 exp i \u03b8A (\u22121)\n\nP\n\nn\u03bd\n\n\u0011\n\n\u03c7(x) ,\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03c7\u0304(x) \u2192 \u03c7\u0304(x) exp \u2212 i \u03b8A (\u22121)\n\nP\n\nn\u03bd\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwith x = a(n1 , . . . , nd ) protects the fermion mass against additive renormalization. On the other\nhand, taking the square and quartic root of the determinant (to obtain Nf = 2+1 dynamical\nflavors) might spoil the locality of the action [3], and the often believed insensitivity to topology\ncould undermine attempts to push towards the chiral limit.\nThe other extreme in terms of computational cost is represented by the closely related\ndomain-wall [4] and overlap [5] fermions. For these actions, the Ginsparg-Wilson relation [6]\nD \u03b3\u02c65 + \u03b35 D = 0,\n\na\n\u03b3\u02c65 = \u03b35 (1 \u2212 D)\n\u03c1\n\n(2)\n\nholds in the massless limit (with \u03c1 for the moment an arbitrary papameter that will be specified\nin (5)), implying invariance under the full chiral symmetry group [7]\n\u03b4\u03c8 = \u03b3\u02c65 \u03c8,\n\n\u03b4\u03c8 = \u03c8\u03b35\n\n(3)\n\nat finite lattice spacing, which again excludes additive mass renormalization and prevents operators in different chiral multiplets from mixing.\nGiven this situation, we decided to investigate the difference between staggered and overlap\nfermions at finite lattice spacing in a simple theory where the concept of chiral symmetry proves\nrelevant and some interesting quantities are known analytically. These criteria are fulfilled by\nthe generalized Schwinger model (QED in 2D with Nf massive degenerate fermions), a superrenormalizable theory [8] where the scale is set through the dimensionful fundamental coupling\n1\ng= \u221a .\na \u03b2\n1\n\n(4)\n\n\fWe produced 10,000 independent gauge configurations on a N \u00d7N = 202 lattice with the\nstandard (compact) Wilson gauge action at \u03b2 = 4, giving a plaquette of 0.86279(10). For\neach configuration we determine the complete eigenvalue spectrum of the massless overlap and\nstaggered operators. This allows us to compute \u2013 for any given mass \u2013 the condensate and the\nfermion determinant, which we use to reweight our observables to Nf = 1, 2 [9].\nWe define the massive overlap operator as\nov\nDm\n= (1\u2212\n\nam ov\n)D + m ,\n2\u03c1\n\nW\naD ov = 1 + \u03b35 sign(a\u03b35 D\u2212\u03c1\n)\n\n(5)\n\nW\nwith D\u2212\u03c1\nthe Wilson operator at negative mass \u2212\u03c1/a. We further set \u03c1 = 1, which we checked,\nfollowing Ref. [10], is an almost optimal choice with respect to locality at our coupling.\nPrevious work on the Schwinger model using a direct approach for the computation of the\nscalar condensate is collected in [11, 12, 13] for staggered, domain-wall/overlap or both actions,\nrespectively. We checked that we reproduce the staggered condensate from [13] and the overlap\ncondensate of FHLW/GHR in [12].\n\n2\n\nScalar condensate\n\nIn the chiral limit, the Nf = 1 scalar condensate is given by [8]\n\u03c7sca (m = 0)\ne\u03b3\n= 3/2 = 0.1599 . . .\ng\n2\u03c0\n\n[Nf = 1] .\n\n(6)\n\nFor Nf = 2 a non-zero value would signal spontaneous symmetry breaking and therefore violate\nthe Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg-Coleman theorem [14]. The prediction how explicit symmetry\nbreaking modifies this zero is [15]\n\u0010 m \u00111/3\n\u03c7sca\n= 0.388 . . .\ng\ng\n\n[Nf = 2] .\n\n(7)\n\nIn the staggered formulation we follow [11] and implement the (1-flavor) condensate through\n\u03c7sca\n1 1\n=\u2212\nh\u03c7\u0304\u03c7i ,\ng\n2 N 2g\n\n(8)\n\nwhere the purpose of the factor 1/2 is to compensate the two-fold degeneracy of the staggered\nformulation in 2D. Denoting the eigenvalues of the massless staggered Dirac operator by \u03bb (they\nshow up in complex conjugate pairs with zero real part), the reweighted condensate is\n1\nst N /2\ni\n1 1 hdet(Dm ) f\n\u03c7sca\n(\u03bb+m)\n=\n,\nst )Nf /2 i\ng\n2 L2 g\nhdet(Dm\n\nP\n\nst\ndet(Dm\n)=\n\nY\n\n(\u03bb+m) .\n\n(9)\n\nwith L = Na and the sum and product running over the entire spectrum. In [11] one finds also\nthe associated free field limit\nN/2\n\n1\n2 m X\n\u03c7sca\n= 2\n2\ng\nN g i,j=1 (am) + sin(2\u03c0i/N)2 + sin(2\u03c0j/N)2\n\n(10)\n\nwhich is, of course, independent of Nf .\nFor overlap fermions, the scalar condensate is unambiguously defined as [12]\n\u03c7sca\n1\n= \u2212 2 h\u03c8 \u03c8\u0302i ,\ng\nN g\n\n\u03c8\u0302 =\n2\n\n1 + \u03b35 \u03b3\u02c65\n\u03c8.\n2\n\n(11)\n\n\fDenoting the eigenvalues of the massless overlap Dirac operator by \u03bb, and remembering that\nwe work with \u03c1 = 1, the reweighted condensate is\n1\u2212a\u03bb/2\nov N\n1 hdet(Dm ) f (1\u2212am/2)\u03bb+m i\n\u03c7sca\n= 2\n,\nov )Nf i\ng\nLg\nhdet(Dm\n\nP\n\nov\ndet(Dm\n)=\n\nY\n\n((1\u2212\n\nam\n)\u03bb+m)\n2\n\n(12)\n\nwhere the sum runs over the full spectrum. These eigenvalues occur either in complex conjugate\npairs or as isolated chiral (doubler) modes at a\u03bb = 0 (2). Finally, one can rewrite (12) as\nov N\n\nP\u2032\n\n1\n\ni\n1 hdet(Dm ) f\n\u03c7sca\n\u03bb\u0302+m\n= 2\n,\nN\nov\ng\nLg\nhdet(Dm ) f i\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bb\u0302 = \u03bb\u22121 \u2212\n\na\n2\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\n(13)\n\nwhere a\u03bb\u0302 is purely imaginary and the sum excludes the doubler modes at a\u03bb = 2.\nDue to the (remnant) chiral symmetry of (staggered) overlap fermions, no subtraction of the\ncondensate is required. Furthermore, the Schwinger model is super-renormalizable, i.e. there is\nno renormalization needed at infinite cut-off. In fact, due to the dimensionful coupling (4), all\nlattice renormalization factors have the form Z = 1 + O(a2g 2 ) and therefore are 1, up to O(a2 )\ncorrections. Hence, both the staggered and the overlap discretization yield (for any Nf and\nm > 0) a finite condensate which is subject to O(a2 ) cut-off effects, without a need for additive\nor multiplicative renormalization.\nA modification which is motivated by what is done in full QCD simulations, is to consider\nthe Dirac operator on a \"copy\" of an element of the Markov chain on which one applies one or\nmore APE/HYP smearing steps (which in 2D is the same). One then thinks of the operator\nas one in the original links, which is less local. For the staggered action, such a modification\npreserves the universality class while considerably reducing the \"taste\" violation [16]. Being\nunaware of any detailed understanding of what the optimum smearing parameter is, we decided\nto combine the staple and the original link with equal weight, which means in a U(1) theory\nthat one takes the arithmetic mean of the phases.\nFig. 1 displays our results for the scalar condensate. As expected, the overlap condensate\nexhibits the qualitatively correct behavior in the chiral limit. For Nf = 0 it shows the quenched\ndivergence, while for Nf = 2 it tends to zero indicating the absence of spontaneous chiral\nsymmetry breaking. In the Nf = 1 case it tends to a constant which seems compatible with the\nanalytic result (6) in infinite volume, marked by an asterisk. Here, we dare to compare to\n\u221a the\ninfinite volume value, since the results in [17] suggest that for Nf = 1 in a box with L > 1/( \u03c0g)\nfinite volume corrections are exponentially small. On the other hand, the staggered condensate\nexhibits a qualitatively wrong behavior in the chiral limit, vanishing for all Nf . At large masses\nit differs substantially from the overlap condensate, presumably due to cutoff effects. In the\nintermediate region, there is a smooth turnover with no sign of a quenched divergence.\nThe dashed curve is Smilga's infinite volume result (7), while the dash-dotted graph represents the free-field expression (10). Finally, since changing m at fixed box-volume V means\nthat one moves from the large to the small Leutwyler-Smilga regime, the point where the\nLeutwyler-Smilga parameter [18]\nx = V \u03a3m\n(14)\nequals 1 is indicated with a vertical dotted line (\u03a3 denotes the analytical result (6)).\nThe real surprise comes when the operators are evaluated after one step of APE/HYP\nsmearing. The overlap condensate stays (for any Nf ) virtually unchanged, except that the size\nof the O(a2 ) artefacts is modified.

And for\nNf = 0 it shows a nice blow-up at moderately small quark masses. If one really considers the\nlimit m \u2192 0 it still tends to zero, but the point where this happens is deep within the \u01eb regime\n(x \u226a 1) [18]. The effect of additional smearing steps will be discussed below.\nFig. 2 shows our results for the \"hybrid\" condensate, labeled after the formulation used\nfor the valence quark. The \"staggered\" condensate (with Nf = 1, 2 sea quarks built from the\noverlap determinant) looks virtually unchanged w.r.t. Fig. 1 (the curve with Nf = 0 is identical).\nOn the other hand, the \"overlap\" condensate (with Nf = 1, 2 sea quarks constructed from the\nstaggered determinant) looks much worse than the original (true) overlap version; there is a\ndivergence near m = 0 for any Nf . This shows that the failure of the unsmeared (\"naive/thinlink\") staggered formulation cannot be attributed to either the determinant or the valence\nprescription alone \u2013 it's the cancellation of the zero in the determinant and the \"one over zero\"\nin the propagator which is needed to get the finite value (6) in the 1-flavor case.\nUpon applying just one step of smearing the situation improves dramatically; both \"hybrids\"\nlook qualitatively right down to much smaller quark masses \u2013 but still, eventually the nonfaithful representation of the zero-mode(s) in the staggered part reflects itself in a fake blow-up\nor drop-down close to the chiral limit.\nFig. 3 contains our results for the condensate in a log-log representation. The overlap data\nshow that the analytic structure in a finite volume is indeed\n\u03c7scal \u221d\nnear the chiral limit and consistent with\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\n(15)\n\n\u03c7scal \u221d m1/3\n\n(16)\n\n1/m (Nf = 0)\nconst (Nf = 1)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nm\n(Nf = 2)\n\nat large masses, albeit the coefficient in (7) is (presumably due to cut-off effects) not reproduced.\nThe bottom part demonstrates that 3 APE/HYP-smearing steps manage to completely\nchange the overall picture of the staggered condensate while the overlap condensate gets rescaled\nby a factor which differs from 1 only marginally. Now, the two formulations are in perfect\nagreement at (moderately) small quark masses, showing only a mild discrepancy at larger m/g:\nthe staggered condensate seems to tend towards the free-field limit (10), while the overlap\nversion moves closer to Smilga's prediction (7). Eventually, the staggered condensate vanishes\nin the chiral limit \u2013 even for Nf = 0. The turnover point, however, is off the scale of the plot.\n\n3\n\nSelection theorem\n\nA remarkable feature of the Schwinger model with Nf = 1 is the \"selection theorem\". This\ntheorem states that in the chiral limit the non-zero value (6) is formed exclusively from the\nzero-modes of chirality \u00b11, which live on backgrounds where the topological charge\nZ\ng\n\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd dx \u2208 Z\n(17)\nq(A) =\n4\u03c0\ntakes the value \u22131. This statement alludes to a combination of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem\nand the vanishing theorem. The former relates (17) to the index of the Dirac operator, defined\nas the difference of the number of negative and positive chirality zero-modes\nind(A) = n\u2212 \u2212 n+ ,\n7\n\n(18)\n\n\fin a simple manner\nq(A) = ind(A) ,\n\n(19)\n\nwhile the latter says that in 2D there is no configuration which supports both positive and\nnegative chirality zero-modes [19]\nn\u2212 =\n6 0 =\u21d2 n+ = 0\n.\nn+ =\n6 0 =\u21d2 n\u2212 = 0\n\n(20)\n\nTo prove the \"selection theorem\" one starts from the partition function of the massless theory\nin the finite volume with periodic boundary conditions (Nf \u2265 1) [17]\nZ[\u03b7\u0304, \u03b7] = N\n\nX Z\n\nq\u2208Z\n\n\u2212 41\n\nDA(q) e\n\nR\n\nF2\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\n|q|\nY\n\n\uf8f6Nf\n\n(\u03b7\u03c8k )(\u03c8 k \u03b7)\uf8f8\n\nk=1\n\ndet \u2032 (D)Nf e+\n\nR\n\n\u03b7S \u2032 \u03b7\n\n(21)\n\nfrom which the condensate is computed by taking one derivative w.r.t. \u03b7 and \u03b7 and then setting\nthe external sources to zero. The outer sum is over all topological sectors and the product is\nover the |q| positive or negative chirality zero-modes. The primes indicate that the determinant\nand the fermion Green's function are computed on the subspace orthogonal to the zero-modes.\nA non-zero value is obtained only if both derivatives hit the prefactor, leaving nothing but the\nexplicit zero-mode and its conjugate behind. This can happen only for Nf = 1 and results in a\ncondensate which is generated exclusively by the zero-modes with chirality \u00b11. Note that the\nargument will hold true in QCD, too, once the current body of numerical evidence in favor of\na vanishing theorem in 4D (see Fig. 1 in [20]) has been replaced by a mathematical proof.\nAs a technical point we mention that on the lattice we define the topological charge of a\nbackground U as the index of the massless overlap operator [21, 7]\n1\nq(U) = ind(U) = tr(a\u03b35Dov )\n2\n\n(22)\n\nand use it for both the staggered and the overlap evaluation of the sectoral condensate.\nFig. 4 displays our results for the condensate if we truncate the partition function at a given\n|q|max . The overlap construct faithfully reproduces the \"selection theorem\", which means that\nthe Nf = 1 condensate tends to zero if one restricts it to the topologically trivial sector, while\nit takes the Schwinger value (6) in the chiral limit for any other |q|max .\nAnalogously, the staggered condensate exhibits (for both Nf shown) a many-sigma difference\nbetween |q|max = 0, 1, 2. This disproves the widely believed fiction that staggered fermions are\n\"insensitive to topology\" \u2013 but they are not sensitive the right way; they don't seem to know\nabout the index and the vanishing theorems which are at the root of the \"selection theorem\".\nFig. 5 shows that the real surprise comes again after one or a few APE/HYP-smearing steps.\nAlready one step lets the staggered Nf = 1 condensate (at intermediate mass) develop a marked\nsensitivity on the topological charge of the background.\nAfter two more steps the qualitative picture is just like in the (unsmeared) overlap case (c.f.\nFig. 4), i.e. smeared staggered fermions do know about the relationship between topology and the\nchirality of zero-modes \u2013 down to rather small (but non-zero) quark masses.\nOf course, if one really performs the chiral limit, the staggered condensate still tends to zero\n\u2013 for any |q|max and even in the quenched case (Nf = 0). This is visible in the top of Fig. 5,\nwhile in the bottom part it is off the scale.\nSince in the Schwinger model various observables have been seen to depend on the topological charge [22], it is surprising that the \"selection theorem\" has not been checked before.\n8\n\n\f0.4\n0.35\n0.3\n\n\u03c7sca/g\n\n0.25\n0.2\n\nNf=0, q=0\nNf=0, |q|\u22641\nNf=0, |q|\u22642\nNf=1, q=0\nNf=1, |q|\u22641\nNf=1, |q|\u22642\n\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\nm/g\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n0.35\n0.3\n\n\u03c7sca/g\n\n0.25\n0.2\n\nNf=0, q=0\nNf=0, |q|\u22641\nNf=0, |q|\u22642\nNf=1, q=0\nNf=1, |q|\u22641\nNf=1, |q|\u22642\n\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\nm/g\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\nFigure 4: Sectoral condensate for overlap (top) and staggered quarks without smearing.\n\n9\n\n\f0.4\n0.35\n0.3\n\n\u03c7sca/g\n\n0.25\n0.2\n\nNf=0, q=0\nNf=0, |q|\u22641\nNf=0, |q|\u22642\nNf=1, q=0\nNf=1, |q|\u22641\nNf=1, |q|\u22642\n\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\nm/g\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n0.35\n0.3\n\n\u03c7sca/g\n\n0.25\n0.2\n\nNf=0, q=0\nNf=0, |q|\u22641\nNf=0, |q|\u22642\nNf=1, q=0\nNf=1, |q|\u22641\nNf=1, |q|\u22642\n\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\nm/g\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\nFigure 5: Sectoral condensate for staggered quarks with 1 and 3 steps of APE/HYP smearing.\n\n10\n\n\f4\n\nTopological susceptibility\n\nAnother interesting observable to study the effects of dynamical fermions is the topological\nsusceptibility which, in the context of this note, shall be defined (in the continuum) through\nhdet(D+m)Nf q 2 i\n.\nV \u2192\u221e V hdet(D+m)Nf i\n\n\u03c7top = lim\n\n(23)\n\nThe main difference to the scalar condensate is that the topological susceptibility depends only\non the sea-quarks, thus offering a potentially cleaner view at the effects of square-rooting the\nstaggered determinant to get Nf = 1.\nFor staggered quarks, the definition (23), taken in fixed volume, reduces to\nst Nf /2 2\n\u03b2 hdet(Dm\n)\nq i\n\u03c7top\n=\n,\nN\n/2\n2\n2\nst\nf\ng\nN hdet(Dm )\ni\n\n(24)\n\nwhile for overlap quarks, the implementation reads\nov Nf 2\n\u03b2 hdet(Dm\n) q i\n\u03c7top\n=\n,\n2\n2\nov\ng\nN hdet(Dm )Nf i\n\n(25)\n\nst\nov\nwhere det(Dm\n) and det(Dm\n) are defined in (9, 12). In either case the sum is over the spectrum\nof the massless operator, and we apply the overlap definition (22) of the topological charge\nboth in (24) and in (25).\nFinally we like to mention the continuum prediction how the topological susceptibility in\nQCD (!) tends to zero, if the quark mass does [18] (the LS parameter x was defined in (14)),\n\n\u03a3m\nNf\n\u221d mNf\n\n\u03c7top =\n\u03c7top\n\n(Nf = 1 \u2228 x \u226b 1)\n(x \u226a 1) .\n\n(26)\n(27)\n\nFig. 6 contains our results for the mass dependence of the topological susceptibility, defined\nvia (24, 25). The full and the dashed lines represent the prediction of (26) for the cases\nNf = 1, 2, respectively. One can see that for both discretizations \u03c7top gets suppressed by\ndynamical fermion effects, but close to the chiral limit only the overlap determinant leads to\nresults which are compatible with the QCD prediction (26) for Nf = 1 and (27) for Nf = 2.\nAgain, just one smearing step proves sufficient to almost eliminate the lattice artefacts the\n\"unsmeared/naive\" staggered determinant was plagued with, while the topological susceptibility for overlap fermions stays basically invariant under such a modification.\n\n5\n\nSpectral hint\n\nAs a hint of what is the likely reason behind the remarkable success of one or a few APE/HYP\nsmearing steps at the \u03b2-value considered, we like to present the effect of such a modification on\nthe spectrum of some individual configurations. In Fig. 7 we plot the physically relevant part\nof the spectrum of the staggered (the a\u03bb from (9)) and overlap (the a\u03bb\u0302 from (13)) operator on\nfour selected configurations before and after smearing.\nThe two configurations on the left are typical examples for topological charge q = 0 and\n|q| = 1, respectively. One sees that on the unsmeared configurations the staggered spectrum\ndoes not resemble that of the overlap operator. Furthermore, it is hard to see a qualitative\n11\n\n\f0.04\n\n\u03c7top/g\n\n2\n\n0.03\n\n0.02\n\nstaggered, Nf=1\nstaggered, Nf=2\noverlap, Nf=1\noverlap, Nf=2\n\n0.01\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\nm/g\n0.04\n\n\u03c7top/g\n\n2\n\n0.03\n\n0.02\n\nstaggered, Nf=1\nstaggered, Nf=2\noverlap, Nf=1\noverlap, Nf=2\n\n0.01\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\nm/g\n\nFigure 6: Topological susceptibility with 0 (top) and 1 steps of APE/HYP smearing.\n\n12\n\n\f|q|=0\n\n|q|=1\n\n|q|=4\n\nsee text\n\n0.5\nstaggered\noverlap\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n1\n\n3\n\n0\n\n1\n\n3\n0\n1\n# smearing steps\n\n3\n\n0\n\n1\n\n3\n\nFigure 7: Physically relevant region of the Dirac spectrum on some selected configurations.\ndifference between q = 0 and |q| = 1 in the spectrum of the original staggered operator. After\na few smearing steps this picture changes. The eigenvalues of the staggered operator seem to\nform near-degenerate pairs which sit close to a single overlap a\u03bb\u0302 on the same configuration. In\nparticular, in the |q| = 1 case a pair of eigenmodes moves very close to the real axis. Clearly, such\na shift mimics the effect of the true zero-mode in the overlap counterpart down to rather small\nquark masses. It is only when the mass becomes comparable to the smallest (smeared staggered)\neigenvalue that the absence of an exact zero-mode matters and a qualitative difference between\nthe staggered and overlap Dirac operators (on that configuration) shows up.\nIn the third column of Fig. 7, a typical configuration with higher topological charge (|q| = 4)\nis displayed. Here, the picture is not so nice any more, since after 3 smearing steps only 3 pairs\nof eigenmodes have come close to the real axis and the fourth one is still somewhat further out.\nTo show that these findings are not generic, the last column of Fig. 7 presents a selected\nconfiguration on which the topological charge varies repeatedly under subsequent smearing\nsteps. Qualitative resemblance between the spectra of the two operators is vague at best and\nthere is no evidence of a pair of staggered eigenvalues moving close to the real axis. Obviously,\nsuch \"sick\" configurations will occur more frequently at larger coupling.\n\n6\n\nSummary\n\nOur findings may be summarized by the following statements:\n1. At finite spacing and in a finite box, the \"naive\" staggered action leads to a scalar condensate which is qualitatively wrong: the staggered results vanish in the chiral limit for\nany Nf , while the overlap successfully reproduces the quenched \u223c 1/m divergence, and\n13\n\n\fthe analytically known Schwinger value in the chiral limit for Nf = 1.\n2. Considering both types of \"hybrid\" formulations (staggered valence quarks with overlap\nsea quarks and vice versa) we find that the failure of the naive staggered formulation\ncannot be attributed to either the determinant or the propagator alone.\n3. The \"selection theorem\" is reproduced, in an impressive manner, with overlap fermions,\nwhile naive staggered fermions fail completely.\n4. The topological susceptibility shows lattice artefacts which are large for unimproved staggered fermions, while the overlap results seem consistent with the known chiral behavior.\n5. Taking the square root of the staggered determinant to have Nf = 1 seems to be no more\nor less harmful than dividing by 2, in the valence sector, to get the 1-flavor condensate.\nAll naive staggered results seem to only gradually vary for Nf = 0, 1, 2 \u2013 even near the\nchiral limit, where they shouldn't.\n6. At the \u03b2 value considered, already one smearing step brings a remarkable improvement:\nalthough formally the chiral limit of staggered fermions is still wrong, the mass at which\none begins to see this is dramatically lowered. At moderate quark masses, one observes\na clear blow-up of the APE/HYP smeared staggered condensate for Nf = 0, while it stays\nclose to the Schwinger value (6) for Nf = 1 and keeps the qualitatively correct behavior at\nNf = 2. Moreover, in spite of naive staggered fermions being misguided in the way they\nsee topology, the APE/HYP variety condensate shows a remarkable sensitivity on |q|max\nfor Nf = 0 and Nf = 1, reproducing the \"selection theorem\" in the latter case. Finally, the\nstaggered artefacts in the topological susceptibility get drastically reduced, resulting in\ngood agreement with the overlap curve down to very small quark masses.\n7. The main difference after a few smearing steps is the size of lattice artefacts in the\ncondensate at large quark masses which make the smeared overlap condensate (for any Nf )\nlie closer to the analytical prediction (7) by Smilga, while the smeared staggered values\nmove more towards the free field prediction (10). The qualitative failure of staggered\nfermions in the chiral limit is only visible at very small quark masses.\n8. Under moderate smearing the modes of the massless staggered Dirac operator form neardegenerate pairs which move close to the corresponding overlap (single) eigenvalues (\u03bb\u0302),\nsupporting the square root and factor 1/2 procedure for staggered spectroscopy. On nontrivial backgrounds the mismatch between the staggered fake zero-mode and the true\noverlap zero gives an estimate of the quark mass at which the deficiency of the staggered\nformulation gets visible, though there are configurations which break this analogy.\nAs a warning against an overly optimistic interpretation of 6/8, we feel obliged to recall that\nwe were working with fairly smooth gauge fields. It is not clear whether such a nice pattern\nholds true also in QCD at accessible couplings.\nAcknowledgments: We are indebted to Gunnar Bali for bringing to our attention the\ninterest in checking chiral properties of staggered fermions in a simple model.
