We observed this object using speckle interferometry at the Keck\ntelescope, obtaining diffraction-limited resolution (55 milliarcseconds) at K\nband, and found it unresolved. Assuming the entire K band excess is due to a\nsingle point-like companion, we place an upper limit on the binary separation\nof 30 milliarcseconds, or 0.42 AU at the star's distance of 14.1 pc. This result,\ncombined with astroseismological data and other images of G29-38, supports the\nhypothesis that the source of the near-infrared excess is not a cool companion\nbut a dust cloud.\n\nSubject headings: binaries: general - circumstellar matter - stars: individual\n(G29-38) - stars: low mass, brown dwarfs - white dwarfs\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nZuckerman and Becklin (1987) discovered that the white dwarf Giclas 29-38 has a large\ninfrared excess and proposed that the excess could be due to a brown dwarf companion. This\nsuggestion inspired discussion of brown dwarfs as white dwarf companions (Stringfellow,\nBlack & Bodenheimer 1990), oscillating brown dwarfs (Marley, Lunine & Hubbard 1990),\nand other possible cool companions that could explain the excess (Greenstein 1988). Later\nphotometry by Tokunaga et al. (1990) and Telesco, Joy & Sisk (1990) suggested that the\n10 micron excess greatly exceeds that expected from a brown dwarf companion, leading\nto the interpretation that the mid-infrared excess originates from a cloud of circumstellar\n1\n\nAlfred P. Sloan Research Fellow\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\ndust. However, new data from ISOCAM (Chary, Zuckerman & Becklin 1998) show that the\n7 and 15 micron excesses are in agreement with a 1000 K blackbody fit to the excess at\nother wavelengths. The source of the infrared excess of G29-38 remains uncertain.\nDirect searches for a companion have produced mixed results. Tokunaga et al. (1988)\nimaged G29-38 at H and K bands and limited the extent of the source to a diameter of\n400 milliarcseconds (mas) or 5.64 AU. Tokunaga et al. (1988) and Tokunaga et al. (1990)\ntook near-infrared spectra of the object and found no evidence for absorption features due\nto a brown dwarf. Haas and Leinert (1990) took slit scans of G29-38 in 1988, and found a\nNorth-South extension at K-band that was well fit by a binary model with a flux ratio of\n1:1 and a separation of 230 \u00b1 40 mas (3.24 \u00b1 0.56 AU). However, when Haas and Lienert\nrepeated their observations the following year under better seeing conditions, the object\nappeared unextended. Shelton, Becklin and Zuckerman (1998) took slit scans of G29-38 in\nthe J and K bands at the Lick 3-meter telescope in October of 1989 to look for the centroid\nshift that would arise if, as the photometry suggests, the hypothetical cool companion is\nbrighter in K and the white dwarf is brighter in J. They did not see this effect. They place\nan upper limit of 40 mas (0.56 AU) on the North-South binary separation, and an upper\nlimit of 120 mas (1.69 AU) on the East-West separation.\nAttempts to find the radial velocity signature of a companion to G29-38 have also\nproven frustrating. Barnbaum & Zuckerman (1992) combined their own spectroscopy with\nradial velocity data by Graham et al. (1990), Graham, Reid, & Rich (1991, personal\ncommunication reported in Graham et al. 1990), Liebert & Saffer (1989, personal\ncommunication reported in Graham et al. 1990) and Liebert, Saffer, & Pilachowski (1989),\nand reported a probable radial velocity variation with a period of 11.2 months and an\namplitude of 10 km s\u22121 . Kleinman et al. (1994), however, argued based on extensive\nastroseismological observations that the radial velocity variation due to a binary companion\nmust be less than \u00b10.65 km s\u22121 assuming a \u223c1 year period.\nHoping to find another clue to the mystery of the infrared excess, we imaged G29-38\nat K band on the 10-m W. M. Keck telescope using speckle interferometry to search for a\nresolved companion at the diffraction limit.\n\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nWe imaged G29-38 at K band with NIRC (the Near-Infrared Camera; Matthews\n& Soifer 1994) on the W. M. Keck telescope on December 15, 1997. The seeing\nwas extraordinary; we used 0.5 second integrations and saw about 5 speckles and a\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\ndiffraction-limited core. We took 12 sets of 100 frames of G29-38. Among observations of\nG29-38 we interspersed observations of two nearby, presumably unresolved calibrator stars,\nS23291+0515 and S23292+0521, which we observed in the same manner as G29-38, for a\ntotal of 6 sets of calibrator frames. We used a version of the speckle reduction software\ndescribed in Koresko et al. (1991) adapted for use with NIRC. We chose a 128 \u00d7 128\npixel subframe centered on the object, and constructed 128 \u00d7 128 pixel sky frames from\nthe corners of the 256 \u00d7 256 pixel NIRC images. From each set of object and sky frames\nwe computed a power spectrum, and a bi-spectrum, and re-constructed Fourier phases\nand amplitudes. We divided the Fourier components from each target set by the Fourier\ncomponents from a few different calibrator sets to correct for the telescope-aperture transfer\nfunction, and in this way assembled 18 calibrated images and 18 calibrated power spectra.\nFigure 1 shows the mean of the images, compared to a simulated image of a point\nsource-the Fourier transform of the Gaussian\u00d7Hanning apodizing function used to\nsynthesize the speckle images. The plate scale is 20.57 mas per pixel. Figure 2 shows\nthe azimuthal average of the arithmetic mean of the calibrated power spectra, where we\nnormalized each power spectrum by dividing it by the geometric mean of the first 15 data\npoints after the zero-frequency component. The error bars represent the 1-\u03c3 variations\namong the 18 power spectra. The \u03bb/D diffraction limit of Keck at K-band is 55 mas.\nThe noise increases at high frequencies because the power in the images decreases near\nthe diffraction limit. The low frequency spike probably occurs because of seeing noise,\nthe change in seeing between observations of G29-38 and observations of the calibrators.\nBecause the final image closely resembles a point source and the power spectrum is\nconsistent with a constant, the power spectrum of a \u03b4-function, we conclude that we did\nnot resolve G29-38.\n\n3.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe K-band flux of G29-38 is 5.46 \u00b1 0.15 mJy; 2.05 mJy of this is in excess of\nGreenstein's (1988) white dwarf model (Tokunaga, Becklin & Zuckerman 1990). We\ncomputed the power spectrum of a binary system consisting of a Greenstein white dwarf\nand a point-like companion which supplies all the excess flux. The only free parameter for\nthis binary model is the angular separation of the components. We fit the model to the\nobserved power spectrum, and derive a best fit binary separation of 20 mas. The maximum\ndeviation of the power spectrum from a straight line, however, is consistent with typical\ndeviations due to time variations of the atmosphere-telescope point-spread function. In\nfigure 2, we compare the 20 mas model with the observed power spectrum and a model with\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nthe same flux ratio but a 30 mas separation. The latter model is marginally inconsistent\nwith our observations, so we report 30 mas as an upper limit to the binary separation.\nAt G29-38's distance of 14.1 pc (Tokunaga et al. 1990), 30 mas corresponds to a\ntransverse separation of 0.42 AU. Assuming that G29-38 is 0.61 M\u2299 (Bergeron et al. 1995),\nan 0.06 M\u2299 brown dwarf orbiting the star at 0.42 AU would have a period of about 0.33\nyears and would create a reflex motion in G29-38 that would have been detectable to\nKleinman et al. (1994) if the orbit were inclined more than 10 degrees from face-on. The\nstatistical likelyhood of an inclination \u2264 10 degrees is 1.5%. Closer orbits would be easier\nto detect from reflex motion.\nPerhaps a brown dwarf orbits G29-38 with a long period that would be hard to identify\nin reflex motion and the brown dwarf happened to pass in front of the star or behind it\nwhen we observed it on December 15, 1997. For instance, Kleinman et al. (1994) saw a\nlong-term trend in their radial velocity data which could be interpreted as a companion\nwith an \u223c 8 year period causing radial velocity variations on the order of 0.8 km/s. Such\na companion would have a semimajor axis of \u223c 3.4 AU. If the orbit had a semi-major axis\na, and were edge-on, the fraction of the time the brown dwarf would spend in the region\nwhere we couldn't resolve it is \u223c \u03c02 sin\u22121 0.42AU\n; for a = 3.4 AU, there is a < 8% chance that\na\nthe brown dwarf would have been hidden from us. Since Shelton et al. (1998) also missed\nthe hypothetical edge-on brown dwarf in 1989 as it passed close to the star, we find this\nscenario unlikely.\nA companion in an eccentric orbit is easier to detect from reflex motion than a\ncompanion in a circular orbit with the same semi-major axis. Therefore such a companion\nwould have to be farther away from the star on average for Kleinman et al. (1994) to have\nmissed it, making it even more unlikely that it would have been hidden from us, Haas &\nLienert (1990), and Shelton et al. (1998). A companion in an eccentric, face-on orbit would\nspend relatively little time close to the star, and probably would not have been missed by\nboth us and Shelton et al. (1998).\nThe infrared excess may represent thermal radiation from a cloud of dust rather\nthan a cool companion (Zuckerman & Becklin 1987). We can place no constraints on the\nconcentration or geometry of such a cloud. Dust radiating thermally at 1\u201315 microns heated\nby radiation from the white dwarf alone would be far too close to the star (< 10\u22123 AU) for\nus to resolve.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n4.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe conclude that the infrared excess of G29-38 is not due to a single orbiting\ncompanion. If there were a single companion producing the excess, it would have to orbit\nalmost face-on and closer than 0.4 AU; or it could orbit roughly edge on, with a period of\nseveral years, in such a way that it happened to appear at a minimum angular separation\nfrom the star in December, 1997 when we observed it and in the fall of 1989 when Haas\n& Lienert (1990) and Shelton et al. (1998) observed it. Either case is highly improbable.\nThis result supports the hypothesis that source of the near-infrared excess is not a cool\ncompanion but a dust cloud (Zuckerman & Becklin 1987; Wickramasinghe et al. 1987;\nGraham et al. 1990; Koester et al. 1997).\nWe thank Eugene Chiang, Chris Clemens, Peter Goldreich, and Ben Zuckerman for\ninspiration and helpful discussions.

Both are normalized so their intensities range from 0 to 1, and have contour\nlevels of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9. G29-38 is unresolved.\nFig. 2.- Azimuthally averaged spatial power spectrum of G29-38 compared to simulated\nazimuthally-averaged power spectra of a binary with a flux ratio equal to the G29-38's Kband excess. The error bars represent 1-\u03c3 variations among the 18 object-calibrator pairs.\nIf G29-38 were a binary with this K-band flux ratio and the separation were larger than 30\nmas, we would have detected the companion.\n\n\f\f\f"}
