The procedure is applicable to ordinary rheological creep (stress-step) measurements, as\nwell as all microrheological techniques, whether they access a Brownian mean-square displacement,\nor a forced compliance. Data can be substituted directly into our simple formula, thus eliminating\ntraditional fitting and smoothing procedures that disguise relevant experimental noise.\n\nThe procedure that has become established [1], for obtaining frequency-dependent dynamic moduli from nonoscillatory rheometry, is to fit the experimental data to a\nparticular model (often the generalized Maxwell model is\nused), and subsequently to calculate the resulting complex viscoelastic modulus, G\u2217 (\u03c9) \u2261 G\u2032 (\u03c9) + iG\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9), for\nthat parametrization of the model. That procedure can\nbe somewhat restrictive, as it may force the user to approximate their data into the prescribed form, or to use\na very large number of fitting parameters. It also artificially hides experimental noise, making the uncertainties\nin the final results difficult to quantify. Equivalently, one\ncan find an approximate Laplace transform of the timedependent data [2], then derive the Laplace transform of\nthe stress relaxation modulus, and subsequently transform from a Laplace to a Fourier description (either numerically or, for certain functional forms, analytically).\nIn either case, the procedure limits the user's freedom in\nthe types of formulae that can easily be fitted and manipulated, and it can be somewhat laborious. Furthermore,\nin cases where the experimental data are imperfectly fitted by the pre-conceived functions, or other approximations are introduced (such as an approximate Laplace\ntransform [2] or its inverse [3]), the accuracy of the derived moduli becomes vague. Here, we show that a more\ndirect, straightforward and accurate treatment of rheometric data is possible, and derive a formula for G\u2217 (\u03c9)\nin terms of the experimental data points themselves.\nLet us begin by summarising why the conversion of\ntime-dependent rheometry data into storage and loss\nmoduli is traditionally such a complicated process. (For\nmore discussion and approximate solutions, see [4, 5].)\nIn principle, a simple relationship exists between the dynamic moduli, G\u2032 (\u03c9) and G\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9), and the experimentally\naccessible time-dependent compliance, J(t). In a shearcreep (or stress-step) experiment,\nJ(t) = \u03b3(t)/\u03c30\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: mike.evans@physics.org\naddress: m.tassieri@elec.gla.ac.uk\n\n(1)\n\nis the ratio of the time-dependent shear strain \u03b3(t) to the\nmagnitude \u03c30 of the constant stress that is switched on\nat time t = 0. Alternatively, in a passive microrheology\nexperiment, the function J(t) is proportional to the mean\nsquare displacement of a probe particle [2, 6] executing\nBrownian motion in the viscoelastic fluid (averaged over\nmany trajectories). Since the relaxation modulus is related to the compliance by a convolution [7],\nZ \u03c4\nG(t) J(\u03c4 \u2212 t) dt = \u03c4,\n(2)\n0\n\nit is, in principle, a simple matter to extract the modulus by deconvolving Eq.(2), using an integral transform,\nsuch as the Fourier transform. So the Complex viscoelastic modulus G\u2217 (\u03c9) (which is the Fourier transform of\nthe time derivative of G(t)), is a simple function of the\nFourier-transformed compliance:\nG\u2217 (\u03c9) =\n\n1\nb\ni\u03c9 J(\u03c9)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere i\u03c9 Jb \u2261 J \u2217 is sometimes called the dynamic compliance [7]. The problem that arises is due to the fact that\nthe Fourier transform (denoted F [. . .](\u03c9) ) of the compliance,\nZ \u221e\nb\nJ(\u03c9)\n\u2261 F [J](\u03c9) \u2261\nJ(t) e\u2212i\u03c9t dt,\n(4)\n\u2212\u221e\n\nis not a convergent integral, since J(t) grows with increasing time. (Even for a solid, where J(t) tends to a finite\nconstant at long times, the integral in Eq. (4) remains\nundefined.) This has led investigators\nR \u221e to resort instead\nto a Laplace transform, JL (s) \u2261 0 J(t) e\u2212st dt, since\nits integral is convergent. Deconvolution of Eq. (2) thus\nyields GL (s), the Laplace tranform of G(t). Only if the\nresulting function is expressed as a simple formula, then\nthe desired complex modulus can finally be obtained by\nanalytic continuation, G\u2217 (\u03c9) = s GL (s)|s=i\u03c9 .\nIn this Letter, we discuss how to bypass the above foray\ninto Laplace space, by working directly with the Fourier\ntransform of the compliance. Although its integral repreb\nsentation in Eq. (4) is not convergent, the quantity J(\u03c9)\n\n\f2\nis nonetheless well defined, as is apparent in Eq. (3), since\nG\u2217 (\u03c9) exists for all real finite \u03c9. It is well known how\nto find the Fourier transform of an unbounded function\nsuch as J(t). We shall nevertheless introduce the method\nin pedagogical detail, in order to clarify its applicability\nto any causality-respecting compliance function, including that dictated by the raw experimental data. This\nwill allow us to find a simple formula for the viscoelastic\nmoduli that are implied by the data.\nFirst we note that causality requires\nJ(t) = 0\n\nfor\n\nt<0\n\n(5)\n\nas there can be no response before the stress step is applied. So J(t) is a function resembling the sketch in\nb\nFig. 1a, and J(\u03c9),\nrequired in Eq. (3), is its Fourier\ntransform. In the long-time limit, the response of a fluid\n(viscoelastic or otherwise) to an imposed step stress is to\nundergo shear at a constant rate. So that the compliance\nJ(t), which is proportional to the total strain, asymptotes\nto a straight line (see Fig. 1a) with a gradient equal to\n \u0308\nthe reciprocal of the static viscosity. So J(t),\nthe second\nderivative of J(t), is a function that vanishes at large t,\nand its Fourier transform therefore converges. We can\nreconstruct the former Fourier transform from the latter,\nsince they are simply related thus:\n\u22121\nb\nJ(\u03c9)\n= 2 F [J \u0308 ](\u03c9).\n\u03c9\n\n(6)\n\nIt is not immediately obvious that a function can be reconstructed from its second derivative, in this way, as\nthere is a danger of losing information about the absolute\noffset and slope of the original function J(t). However, we\ncan retain that information since we have, as a reference,\nthe known part of the function given in Eq. (5). To do so,\nwe must perform the double differentiation of J(t) over\nthe whole of the function's domain, including negative\nand zero values of t, as shown schematically in Fig. 1b\n \u0307\nand c. Notice that J(t)\nhas a discontinuity at t = 0, of\n \u0307\nsize J(0), the initial gradient (at time t = 0+ ) of the com \u0307\npliance. Differentiating the discontinuous function J(t)\nyields the second derivative, J \u0308(t) which vanishes at neg \u0307\native times, has a Dirac delta function of strength J(0)\nlocated at t = 0, and is finite for positive t (see Fig. 1c).\nSubstituting that form into Eq. (6) yields\nZ \u221e\n \u0307\n\u2212J(0)\n1\nb\n \u0308 dt,\nJ(\u03c9)\n=\n\u2212\ne\u2212i\u03c9t J(t)\n\u03c92\n\u03c9 2 0+\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the integration is over positive values of t only, for\n \u0308 is non-singular. That integration\nwhich the function J(t)\ncan be performed by standard Fourier transform methods\nif we define a simpler function J2 (t) that is the second\nderivative of J(t) excluding the delta function,\n\uf8f1\n \u0308\n\uf8f2 J(t)\nfor\nt > 0,\n(8)\nJ2 (t) \u2261\n\uf8f3\n0\notherwise.\n\nJ\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\nJ&\n\nJ&&\n\n0\n\nt\n\n0\n\nt\n\n(c)\nJ&(0) \u03b4(t)\n\n0\n\nt\n\nJ&(0)\n\nFIG. 1: (a) Sketch of a typical time-dependent compliance,\nJ(t), which must vanish for negative t due to causality. (b)\nIts first derivative, J \u0307(t). (c) The second derivative, J \u0308(t).\n\nIn terms of J2 (t), the integral in Eq. (7) is simply\nF [J2 ](\u03c9), so that Eq. (3) yields a simple formula for the\n \u0307\nstorage and loss moduli, G\u2032 (\u03c9) + iG\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) = i\u03c9/{J(0)\n+\nF [J2 ](\u03c9)}.\nLet us generalize to include compliance functions that\nare discontinuous at t = 0, since a finite discontinuity J(0) \u2261 limt\u21920+ J(t) 6= 0 is often observed, reflecting the fact that the data-acquisition rate cannot access the regime of a material's response preceeding a\nsmall-t plateau in J. Such a compliance function has\na delta-function contribution to its first derivative J \u0307(t),\nof strength J(0). Hence, defining J1 (t) to exclude that\n \u0307 = J1 (t) + J(0) \u03b4(t), we have\ndelta function, so that J(t)\nb\nJ(\u03c9)\n= {J(0) + F [J1 ](\u03c9)}/i\u03c9, ultimately yielding\nG\u2032 (\u03c9) + iG\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) =\n\ni\u03c9\n.\n \u0307\ni\u03c9J(0) + J (0) + F [J2 ](\u03c9)\n\n(9)\n\nSince Eq. (9) holds for any compliance function, we\nnow apply it directly to the experimental data, by defining the piecewise linear function J(t) that interpolates\nbetween data points, depicted in Fig. 2. It is obvious\nthat the resulting angularity and non-monotonicity of\nthe function are unphysical consequences of the experimental noise, but attempting to remove them by using\na smooth fitting function would constitute doctoring the\ndata. Instead, we take the data at face value by using this function that passes through every data point.\nSince evaluation of the Fourier transform requires J(t)\nto be defined for all positive t, while experimental data\nare finite, our piecewise linear function must include an\nextrapolation to t = \u221e, thus introducing one extra parameter, the steady-state viscosity \u03b7 (see Fig. 2). This is\nnot a peculiarity of the present method; any data-analysis\nfor converting J(t) to G\u2217 (\u03c9) requires such extrapolation,\nthough some methods obscure it in arcane algorithms.\nThe second derivative of our experimental function J(t)\nis a series of delta functions, so its Fourier transform is\ntrivial to evaluate.

The time-dependent creep compliance J(t)\nwas determined in a stress-step measurement performed\nat 0 Celsius using a commercial AntonPaar MCR-501\nrheometer (cone diameter 25mm, cone angle 1 degree).\nThe insets of Fig. 3 show the measured strain curves\n(top left inset), and thus the compliance curves (bottom\nright inset), at three different shear stresses of magnitude\n200 Pa, 500 Pa and 1000 Pa.

Obtaining a single data point by\noscillatory rheometry at that same frequency \u03c9min would\nrequire several complete oscillations, thus taking an order of magnitude longer than the creep measurement of\nthe entire dynamic spectrum. The highest accessible frequency, \u03c9max \u2248 t\u22121\n1 , is set by the early-time resolution of\nthe stress-step experiment, where the first reliable data\nare obtained at time t1 . At high frequencies, however,\noscillatory measurements are relatively quick to perform\nand can yield better precision than can be obtained from\nthe short-time creep response of the rheometer (depending on details of the instrument's design). Hence, in practice, using a combination of creep and oscillatory measurements may be the best strategy to determine a fluid's\nentire dynamic spectrum.\nFinally, we note that Eq. (10) has another use besides substitution of raw data. Even for analytical functions J(t) (such as might be used in theoretical work,\nor to approximate noisy data), standard numerical algorithms can fail to evaluate the Fourier transform required in Eq. (9), if the small-t behaviour of J is nontrivial. Equation (10) turns out to be a reliable method\nfor numerically evaluating the required function, with\naccuracy greatly superior to simple quadrature algorithms such as trapesium rule. To demonstrate this, a\nsmooth function (see caption to Fig. 4) was fitted to\nthe compliance data in Fig. 3, and was then sampled\nat logarithmically-uniform intervals in t, for substitution\ninto Eq. (10). This yielded the smooth curves in the inset to Fig. 4. We found convergence on the exact result\nfor 200 sample points, and that the above Mathematicar\ncode executed in a matter of seconds, whereas the builtin FourierTransform algorithm stalled when applied to\nevaluate Eq. (9).\nIn summary, dynamic moduli can be straightforwardly obtained by substitution of compliance data into\nEq. (10), which is equally valid for viscoelastic fluids or\nsolids. The equation is quick to evaluate, removes the\nneed for approximate fitting or obscure black-box algorithms, and correctly preserves the experimental noise\nthat is so crucial to good scientific methodology.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS: We are grateful to Alexei Likhtmann for informative discussions.
