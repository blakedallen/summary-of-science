For the first time the influence of finite deformation\non the condition of elastic waves generation by non-equilibrium electrons\nis discussed.

For example oscillations with small amplitudes\nmay spread in any mediums. Velocity of waves depends on interaction of the\nstructural elements of medium. Further the regular arrangement of the structural\nelements in space is supposed. In particular, atoms in crystals form a periodic\nspatial lattice and a spread of waves with small amplitudes is accompanied by small\ndisplacements of atoms from standings of equilibrium. If the structural elements\nhave some positions of equilibrium with the various reserved energy the motion is\npossible at which building blocks consistently transfer from the position with the\ngreater energy to the position with smaller energy. The wave of falling dominoes\nis an example of such waves of switching. The comprehension of the features of\nthis wave is useful for the interpretation of the martensite crystal growth. These\nfeatures are listed in a kickoff of the report.\nThen the features of modified switching waves controlling the martensite crystal\ngrowth are considered. In a final part the new results are given. These results\nare essential to improvement of the conditions of wave generation at considerable\nstrains breaking symmetry of a lattice.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nSWITCHING WAVE IN DOMINO SYSTEM\n\nA necessary condition for existence of a switching wave.\nThe separate domino is an element of medium with three equilibrium positions\nshown in a fig. 1. The first and second positions are metastable against diversions\nin some intervals of values (smaller interval for the first position) and third position is labilely to as much as small diversions. The third position has the greatest\n\nFigure 1. The equilibrium positions of a domino.\npotential energy U3 in a gravitational field. The quantity \u2206U12 = U1 \u2212U2 increases\nas the difference of vertical coordinates of a centre of gravity of a domino. The\ndifference of energies \u2206U31 = U3 \u2212 U1 is an energy barrier. The transition 1 \u2212\u2192 2\nis impossible without overcoming of this barrier. As it follows from the law of conservation of energy, after overcoming a barrier the difference of potential energies\n\u2206U32 = U3 \u2212 U2 will transferred into a kinetic energy E. If the energy E exceeds\na barrier \u2206U31 there is an opportunity for self-sustaining (or \"autocatalytic\") of\nswitching wave propagation. In a fig. 2 the instant is shown when four dominoes\nhave transferred to a state 2\u2032 with a low potential energy U2\u2032 (U2\u2032 exceeds U2 a\nlittle). Fifth domino has overcome a potential barrier and this domino matches a\n\nFigure 2. The switching wave in a domino.\nposition of the wave front propagating from left to right. It is supposed that the\n2\n\n\fdomino being extreme at the left has received the energy E0 in an initial instant\n(E0 exceeds a barrier \u2206U31 ). Then the further autocatalytic process develops un\u2032\nder condition of: E \u2032 = \u2206U32\n= U3 \u2212 U2\u2032 > \u2206U31 . Let's note that during interaction\nof dominoes among themselves and with a surrounding medium the part of energy\nis dissipated. Therefore quantity E \u2032 should exceed \u2206U31 not less than on quantity\nof dissipated energy.\nAbout a wave velocity.\nIt is clearly that even in an ideal case, when the energy dissipation misses,\nthe switching wave velocity C \u2212\u2192 0 if \u2206U12 \u2212\u2192 0 as the exuberant energy for\nundular transport peters. Therefore the ascending of because of the ascending\n\u2032\nof \u2206U12\n= U1 \u2212 U2\u2032 is natural. For the fixing of a functional connection view\nit is enough to use\np the energy conservation law. Then it is evidently that C\n\u2032\n. Dependence of the starting and the wave propagation\nis proportional to \u2206U12\nfrom the domino's sizes relation Let's consider that a mass of a domino is constant.\nThen the diminution of the basis size together with the ascending of a vertical\ndimension (in the first equilibrium position) are accompanied by ascending of U1\nby decrease of U2 and accordingly by ascending of velocity C. Similar change of\nthe form besides leads to the decreasing of an energy barrier \u2206U31 = U3 \u2212 U1\nand to the decreasing of the stability of an initial state with energy U1 . Then the\nenergy E0 , which is necessary to the switching wave beginning, also is reduced. If\nthe homogeneous system of a dominoes has very small energy of a barrier a place\nof the switching wave beginning is casual. Such place is oozed by small diversions\n(by fluctuations) from medial values of parameters of a surrounding medium. As\ncasual diversions to the left and to the right are equality probability, in system\nof elements with a low energy threshold there can be the switching waves with\nopposite directions of propagation.\nAbout global and local infringement of symmetry.\nIf not to change the form of a dominoes the decrease of size of a barrier can be\nachieved at slightly rejecting from horizontal orientation of a basic plane. Then,\nas it is obvious from fig. 3a, the wave propagation direction (downwards along\nan oblique plane), corresponding to the overcoming of a small energy barrier, is\nexplicitly chosen. Introduction of a plane declination can be interpreted as the\nexternal field influence leading to a global infringement of the diversion symmetry\n(to the left and to the right) from a standing of equilibrium (for all elements).\nNow it is easy to represent the system with the local infringement of symmetry\n(see fig. 3b.) It is clear that the chosen (canted) domino has the greatest energy\nand corresponds to the inhomogeneity in system (i.e. corresponds to an interior\nlocal field), leading to the switching wave in a direction indicated by an arrow.\n(\"NC\" is an abbreviation of words \"nucleation centre\").\nThe intermediate resume.\n\n3\n\n\fFigure 3. Infringement of symmetry: a) global; b) local.\n1. The switching wave is spreading with the help of go-ahead mechanism of an\nenergy transmission (from an element to an element).\n2. The energy liberation begins after overcoming an energy barrier and is localized in the wave front region.\n3. An energy barrier can vary both globally and locally due to action of an\nexterior fields and an internal fields. The analysis of an internal fields allows to find the most probable place of a wave start and a direction of its\npropagation.\n4. The wave propagation speed is increasing if a difference of energies is increasing for states between which the switching is taking place.\n\n3\n\nNUCLEATION AND GROWTH OF THE MARTENSITIC CRYSTAL\n\nIn the distributed mediums in some cases it is possible to specify the spatial sizes\n(scales) of those meshes which play a role of effective bistable elements. As a rule\nsimilar cells contain a lot of microparticles and there is a problem about the mechanism providing the coordinated overcoming of an energy barrier by microparticles.\n4\n\n\fVivid example of such behaviour is the growth of martensitic crystals\nin iron based alloys.\nThe reconstructive phase transitions, to which the \u03b3 \u2212 \u03b1 martensitic transformation (MT) is related, demonstrate pronounced features of the first-order transitions, namely, considerable temperature hysteresis (between the direct and reverse\ntransformations) and thermal and volume effects.\nProcesses of martensite nucleation are heterogeneous.\nTo the features of MT it is necessary to refer a series of morphological characteristics and, certainly, the growth of the martensitic crystals with the hyper\nsound speed being the major feature of a microkinetics. The last feature is showing the undular nature of the mechanism controlling the growth of the martensitic\ncrystals. Features of MT are explained in the switching wave model with quite\nconcrete dynamic oscillatory structure of the transition (interphasic) region being\na front of the switching wave. Now we will list the key standings of model (the\ndynamic distinctive features of model are submitted on fig. 4).\n\n\u03be1\n\u03be2\n\nc~2\nc~1\n\n~c\n\nFigure 4. Nucleation and growth of martensitic crystal in the model of the\nmodified switching wave.\n1. The specific volume fulfills the function of the leading order parameter. The\nswitching is taking place between values of the specific volume.\n5\n\n\f2. The part of a total energy which depends from an order parameter and has\ntwo stable states is considered. The relative stability of states (as well as an\nenergy barrier parting their) depends on temperature. In model of a domino\nof such dependence it is possible to correlate with change of a relation of the\ndomino's sizes.\n3. Now the role of a separate domino overcoming an energy barrier is played by\na three-dimensional mesh in the shape of a prolate rectangular parallelepiped\n(see fig. 4).\nIts pairs of edges oscillate in opposed phases. In result the flat strain of the\ntension-compression type will be stimulated. The excited parallelepiped radiates the wave-beames, propagating in orthogonal directions with velocities\nC1 and C2 .\n4. The lattice sequentially loses a stability, shaping plate-like area there, where\nthe wave beams boosting threshold strain are imposed.\n5. The energy for autocatalytic undular process is oozed only in the region\nwhich has tested threshold strain. Therefore hyper sound velocity C (the\nvector total of velocities C1 and C2 of wave beams) becomes the actual\ngrowth velocity of martensitic crystals. It is important to underline that\nthe dynamic structure of wave-front is precisely the reason which leads to\nthe hyper sound velocity of a modified switching wave. Let's note that\nthe velocity of the unmodified wave of switching depends on a difference of\nspecific free energies of phases [1] and does not reach a speed of sound.\n6. The initial state in the shape of an oscillating parallelepiped arises in elastic\nfields created by defects. The defects are identified as the dislocations (on a\nfig. 4 the segment restricted by symboles \u22a5 matches a dislocation line ). The\nparallelepiped has the edges with normals oriented along the eigenvectors (\u03bei )\nof the strain tensor of elastic fields created by defects. Thus directions of\npropagation of wave-beams are genetically connected with an elastic field of\ndefect in the region of a nucleation.\n7. In the stage of rapid martensite crystal growth the intensive electron currents\nexists in a region between the phases. This region is characterized by strong\ngradients of chemical potential \u2207\u03bc. The gradients in turn are connected\nwith the difference of phase specific volumes.\n8. The part of a kinetic energy of an electron current is conversed to the energy of wave-beams owing to the generation mechanism of waves by nonequilibrium electrons. The essence is simple. There are more electrons moving against the gradient than along the gradient i.e. there are the pairs\n6\n\n\fof electronic states with inverted population. Therefore the generation of\nelastic waves by non-equilibrium electrons is interpreted as a phonon maser\neffect.\n\n4\n\nINFLUENCE OF THE FINITE DEFORMATIONS ON NUMBER OF PAIRS Ref OF ELECTRONIC STATES WITH INVERTED POPULATION\n\nAs shown in the previous papers generalized in the monography [1] in case of\nan ideal lattice the number Ref is sufficient for generation of waves carrying the\nthreshold strain of the order of limit of elasticity \u03b5e . It is important to fix how the\nfinite strain will influence onto number of Ref . Let's remind that the lattice strain\n(Bein's strain) of the order of 0, 1 i.e. is equal (102 \u2212 103 )\u03b5e . The calculation of Ref\nwas carried out for a model electronic spectrum in a tight-binding approximation\n[2]. The strain \u03b5 had the same phylum as threshold strain. It is shown that\nthere is a considerable gamut of strains, in which the value of Ref is increasing at\nthe ascending of \u03b5. For example on fig.5 the dependence on tensile strain (along\nan axis of symmetry of the fourth order initial fcc lattice) of \u2206S(\u03b51 )/\u2206S(0) is\ndemonstrated for an energy interval 0, 6 dim 1, 0 eV near of Fermi-level \u03bc = 0, 8 eV\n(without taking into account of the dependence of \u03bc on \u03b5). The analysis shows that\n\nFigure 5. An example of the dependence of \u2206S(\u03b51 )/\u2206S(0) on tensile deformation.\n7\n\n\fthe essential increment of \u2206S(\u03b51 )/\u2206S(0) in the strain interval 0, 06 dim 0, 4 (the\ngreatest growth of rate of \u2206S(\u03b51 )/\u2206S(0) is achieved in narrow region 0, 103 <\n\u03b51 < 0, 116) is caused by the states located on square planes of Brillouin zone\n(orthogonal to \u2207\u03bc). The area of this square planes increases during deformation.\nAt a standing of Fermi-level near of the peak of a density of states the similar\ndependences take place and for a plane deformation. The considered examples\ntestify about an opportunity of essential decrease of threshold value of inverted\npopulation difference \u03c3th during deformation.\nThis conclusion is important for the description of a stage of growth of the\ncrystal of martensite (when the lattice experiences the significant deformation\nafter loss of stability) as well as for the description of the nucleation stage of\nmartensitic crystals. It is gives additional arguments in favor of the mechanism of\nrigid excitation of initial fluctuations at reconstructive martensitic transformations\n(\u03c3th is decreasing when the amplitudes of fluctuations are increasing).\nIt is possible to assume, that most intensive martensitic transformations take\nplace in alloys of such composition for which the decreasing of \u03c3th is typical during\nincreasing deformation.\n\n5\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIt has been shown that the interphase region is capable to generation of waves\nand during a plastic strain breaking symmetry of a lattice. It is important for\nimprovement of the physical nature of a modified switching wave.\n\nReferences\n[1] M. P.
