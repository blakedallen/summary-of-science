There are\ncontinuum many such actions up to orbit equivalence and von Neumann equivalence, and they may be chosen to be conjugate to any prescribed action when restricted to the free factors.

This gives, in particular, the first examples of\nsuch actions for the free group on 2 generators.\n\nKeywords : Free products, Relative property (T), Measured equivalence relations, Group measure space\nconstruction, Outer automorphism group\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nSeveral breakthroughs in von Neumann Algebras theory and Orbit Equivalence have been made possible, during\nthe last years, by the introduction by S. Popa of the notion of rigidity for pairs B \u2282 N of von Neumann algebras\n[Pop06]. This property is inspired by the relative property (T) of Kazhdan and is satisfied by the inclusion\nL\u221e (T2 ) \u2282 L\u221e (T2 ) \u22ca SL(2, Z) associated with the standard action of SL(2, Z) on the 2-torus. It has proved\nto be extremely useful, more generally, for inclusions A \u2282 M (R) arising from standard countable probability\nmeasure preserving (p.m.p.) equivalence relations R, where A is a Cartan subalgebra in the generalized crossed\nproduct or group-measure-space construction von Neumann algebra [MvN36], [FM77b].\nIn case the pair A \u2282 M (R) is rigid, the relation is said to have the relative property (T). When combined\nwith antagonistic properties like Haagerup property [Pop06] or (amalgamated) free product decomposition\n[IPP08], the rigid Cartan subalgebra were shown to be essentially unique, thus allowing orbit equivalence\ninvariants (like the cost [Gab00], L2 -Betti numbers \u03b2n (R) [Gab02] or the fundamental group F (R) [Gab02,\nCor. 5.7],. . . ) to translate to von Neumann algebras invariants. This led to the solution of the long standing\nproblem of finding von Neumann II1 factors with trivial fundamental group [Pop06].\nWhile the class of groups that admit a free p.m.p. ergodic relative property (T) action is closed under certain\nalgebraic constructions (like direct products, commensurability [Pop06], or free product with an arbitrary group\n[IPP08, Cor. 7.15]), the building blocks were very few and relying on some arithmetic actions [Pop06], [Val05],\n[Fer06] leaving open the general problem [Pop06, Prob. 5.10.2.]: \"Characterize the countable discrete groups\n\u03930 that can act with relative property (T) on the probability space (X, \u03bc), i.e., for which there exist free ergodic\nmeasure preserving actions \u03c3 on (X, \u03bc) such that L\u221e (X, \u03bc) \u2282 L\u221e (X, \u03bc) \u22ca\u03c3 \u03930 is a rigid embedding.\"\nThe purpose of this paper is first to prove that the class of groups that admit such a free p.m.p. ergodic\nrelative property (T) action contains all non-amenable free products of groups. Moreover, we show that they\nhave continuously many different such actions (Th. 1.3) and we remove any arithmetic assumption on the\nindividual actions of the building pieces. In fact, given the state of art, an arithmetic flavor remains hidden in\nthe way the individual actions are mutually arranged.\n\u2217 CNRS\n\n1\n\n\fRelative Property (T) Actions\n\n2\n\nOuter automorphisms groups of standard equivalence relations are usually hard to calculate and there are\nonly few special families of group actions for which one knows that Out(R) = {1}. The first examples are\ndue to S. Gefter [Gef93], [Gef96] and more examples were produced by A. Furman [Fur05]. They all take\nadvantage of the setting of higher rank lattices. Monod-Shalom [MS06] produced an uncountable family of non\norbit-equivalent actions with trivial outer automorphisms group, by left-right multiplication on the orthogonal\ngroups of certain direct products of subgroups. Using rigidity results from [MS06], Ioana-Peterson-Popa [IPP08]\ngave the first shift-type examples. However, all these examples are concerned with very special kind of actions.\nAnd the free groups keep out of reach by these techniques.\nThe first general result appeared recently in a paper by S. Popa and S. Vaes [PV10] and concerns free products\n\u039b \u2217 F\u221e of any countable group \u039b with the free group on infinitely many generators F\u221e , with no condition at\nall on the \u039b-action. This relies heavily on the existence of a relative property (T) action for F\u221e . The second\npurpose of our paper is twofold: extend the result from F\u221e to free groups on finitely many generators, and\nusing the first part extend it to any non elementary free products \u03931 \u2217 \u03932 of groups (i.e. (|\u03931 | \u2212 1)(|\u03932 | \u2212 1) \u2265 2).\nThis leads, in particular, to the first examples of actions of the free groups Fn , \u221e > n > 1, with trivial outer\nautomorphisms group.\n----oooOOOOOooo----\nBefore stating more precisely our results, let's recall some definitions. We only consider measure preserving\nactions on the standard Borel space. First, from [Pop06, Def. 4.1] the definition of a rigid inclusion (or of\nrelative rigidity of a subalgebra).\nDefinition 1.1 Let M be a factor of type II1 with normalized trace \u03c4 and let A \u2282 M be a von Neumann\nsubalgebra. The inclusion A \u2282 M is called rigid if the following property holds: for every \u01eb > 0, there exists a\nfinite subset J \u2282 M and a \u03b4 > 0 such that whenever M HM is a Hilbert M -M -bimodule admitting a unit vector\n\u03be with the properties\n\u2022 ka * \u03be \u2212 \u03be * ak < \u03b4 for all a \u2208 J ,\n\u2022 |ha * \u03be, \u03bei \u2212 \u03c4 (a)| < \u03b4 and |h\u03be * a, \u03bei \u2212 \u03c4 (a)| < \u03b4 for all a in the unit ball of M ,\nthen, there exists a vector \u03be0 \u2208 H satisfying k\u03be \u2212 \u03be0 k < \u01eb and a * \u03be0 = \u03be0 * a for all a \u2208 A.\n\u03c3\n\nDefinition 1.2 [Pop06, Def. 5.10.1] A free p.m.p. ergodic action \u0393 y (X, \u03bc) (respectively a countable standard\np.m.p. equivalence relation R on (X, \u03bc)) is said to have the relative property (T) if the inclusion of the\nCartan subalgebra L\u221e (X, \u03bc) is rigid in the (generalized) crossed-product L\u221e (X, \u03bc) \u2282 L\u221e (X, \u03bc) \u22ca\u03c3 \u0393 (resp.\nL\u221e (X, \u03bc) \u2282 M (R)).\nOne could say that the equivalence relation has \"the property (T) relative to the space (X, \u03bc)\". Observe that\nA. Ioana [Ioa07, Th. 4.3] exhibited for every non-amenable group, some actions \u03c3 satisfying a weak form of\nrelative rigidity, namely for which there exists a diffuse Q \u2282 L\u221e (X, \u03bc) \u2282 M (R\u03c3 ) such that Q is relatively rigid\nin M (R\u03c3 ) and has relative commutant contained in L\u221e (X, \u03bc).\nRecall the following weaker and weaker notions of equivalence for p.m.p. actions or standard equivalence\nrelations R, S on (X, \u03bc):\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b2\n\nTwo actions \u0393 y (X, \u03bc) and \u039b y (X, \u03bc) are Conjugate\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u0393 y (X, \u03bc) Conj\n\u223c \u039b y (X, \u03bc)\n\n(1)\n\nif there is a group isomorphism h : \u0393 \u2192 \u039b and a p.m.p. isomorphism of the space f : X \u2192 X that conjugate\nthe actions \u2200\u03b3 \u2208 \u0393, (almost every) x \u2208 X: f (\u03b1(\u03b3)(x)) = \u03b2(h(\u03b3))(f (x)).\nTwo p.m.p. standard equivalence relations R, S are Orbit Equivalent\nR OE\n\u223c S\n\n(2)\n\n\fRelative Property (T) Actions\n\n3\n\nif there is a p.m.p. isomorphism of the space that sends classes to classes, or equivalently [FM77b] if the\nassociated pairs are isomorphic\n\u0001\n\u0001\nL\u221e (X, \u03bc) \u2282 M (R) \u2243 L\u221e (X, \u03bc) \u2282 M (S) .\n(3)\nThis makes the relative property (T) an orbit equivalence invariant.\nThe standard equivalence relations are von Neumann Equivalent if solely the generalized crossed products\nare isomorphic\nM (R) \u2243 M (S).\n(4)\nThey are von Neumann Stably Equivalent if (they are ergodic and) the generalized crossed product\nfactors are stably isomorphic for some amplification r \u2208 R\u2217+\nM (R) \u2243 M (S)r .\n\n(5)\n\nWe obtained in [GP05] that the non-cyclic free groups admit continuously many relative property (T) orbit\ninequivalent, and even von Neumann stably inequivalent, free ergodic actions. We show that free products admit\nrelative property (T) free actions and that we have a full freedom for the conjugacy classes of the restrictions\nof the action to the freeQfactors. In what follows, a free product decomposition \u0393 = \u2217i\u2208I \u0393i is called non\nelementary if (|I| \u2212 1) i\u2208I (|\u0393i | \u2212 1) \u2265 2, i.e. there are at least 2 free factors, none of them is \u223c {1} and if\n|I| = 2, then one of the \u0393i has at least 3 elements.\nTheorem 1.3 Every non elementary free product \u0393 = \u2217 \u0393i admits continuum many von Neumann stably\ni\u2208I\n\ninequivalent relative property (T) free ergodic p.m.p. actions, whose restriction to each factor is conjugate with\nany (non necessarily ergodic) prescribed free action.\n\u03c3i\n\nMore precisely, let \u0393i y (X, \u03bc) be an at most countable collection of p.m.p. (non necessarily ergodic) free\nactions of countable groups \u0393i on the standard probability space. There exists continuum many von Neumann\ninequivalent free ergodic actions (\u03b1t )t\u2208T of the free product \u0393 = \u2217i\u2208I \u0393i that have relative property (T), and\nsuch that for every t \u2208 T and i \u2208 I, the restriction \u03b1t |\u0393i of \u03b1t to \u0393i is conjugate with \u03c3i\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03b1t |\u0393i\n\u03c3i\n\u0393i y (X, \u03bc) Conj\n\u223c \u0393i y (X, \u03bc) .\n\n(6)\n\nWe introduced in [Gab00] in connection with cost, the notion of freely independent equivalence relations\nand of free decomposition of an equivalence relation (see [Alv08] for a geometric approach):\nS = \u2217 Si .\ni\u2208I\n\n(7)\n\nThe following, essentially due to A. T\u00f6rnquist [T\u00f6r06], see also [IPP08, Prop. 7.3], states that countable\nstandard equivalence relations may be put in general position:\nTheorem 1.4 (Tornquist) Let (Si )i\u2208I be a countable collection of standard p.m.p. equivalence relations on\n(X, \u03bc), then there exists an equivalence relation S on (X, \u03bc) generated by a family of freely independent subrelations Si\u2032 such that Si\u2032 OE\n\u223c Si , \u2200i \u2208 I.\nWe obtain in fact the following more general form of Theorem 1.3 involving equivalence relations instead of\nfree actions. Recall that a p.m.p. standard equivalence relation is called aperiodic if almost all its classes are\ninfinite.\nTheorem 1.5 Let (Si )i\u2208I be a countable collection (with |I| \u2265 2) of p.m.p. standard countable aperiodic\nequivalence relations on the standard non atomic probability space (X, \u03bc). Then there exists continuum many\nvon Neumann stably inequivalent relative property (T) ergodic p.m.p. equivalence relations on (X, \u03bc) generated\nby a freely independent family of subrelations Si\u2032 such that for every i \u2208 I, Si\u2032 OE\n\u223c Si .\nMore precisely, there exists a strictly increasing continuum of ergodic equivalence relations St , t \u2208 (0, 1] such\nthat\n\n\fRelative Property (T) Actions\n\n4\n\n1. for every t \u2208 (0, 1], we have a free decomposition St = \u2217 Si,t such that Si,t OE\n\u223c Si for all i \u2208 I\ni\u2208I\n\n2. for every t \u2208 (0, 1],\n\nlim\n\ns\u2192t,s<t\n\n\u0580 Ss = St\n\n3.

Vaes obtained actions with trivial outer automorphism group for the particular family of free\nproducts F\u221e \u2217 \u039b (and \u039b may be trivial):\nTheorem 1.6 ([PV10, Th. 4.3]) For every countable group \u039b, there exists a continuum of pairwise von Neumann stably inequivalent free, ergodic, p.m.p. actions (\u03c3t )t\u2208T of the free product F\u221e \u2217 \u039b, with relative property\n(T), with Out(R\u03c3t ) = {1}, with trivial fundamental group, and whose restriction to \u039b is conjugate with a\nprescribed free action.\nInspired by their techniques, we extend this kind of results to the non-cyclic free groups on finitely many\ngenerators, and more generally to any free product without any condition on the building blocks:\nTheorem 1.7 There exists continuum many, pairwise von Neumann stably inequivalent, relative property (T),\nergodic p.m.p. free actions (\u03c3t )t\u2208T of the free group Fr , r = 2, 3, * * * such that Out(R\u03c3t ) = {1}.\nTheorem 1.8 Every non elementary free product of countable groups \u2217i\u2208I \u0393i admits continuum many von\nNeumann inequivalent free ergodic (\u03c3t )t\u2208T actions with relative property (T), with Out(R\u03c3t ) = {1} and whose\nrestriction to each factor \u0393i is conjugate with a prescribed free action.\nThis follows from the more general form involving equivalence relations.\nTheorem 1.9 Let (Si )i\u2208I , |I| \u2265 2, be a countable collection of p.m.p. standard countable aperidodic equivalence\nrelations on the standard Borel space.

Thus, under mild conditions on L2 -Betti numbers (see [Gab02]) or on the cost\n(see [Gab00]) we get a more precise information and produce plenty of new examples of factors with trivial\nfundamental group:\nCorollary 1.10 If some L2 -Betti number \u03b2n (St ) for some n \u2208 N \\ {0}, or if the cost(St ) \u2212 1 does not belong\nto {0, \u221e} then the von Neumann inequivalent St in Theorems 1.3 and 1.9 are in fact von Neumann stably\ninequivalent St and the associated von Neumann algebras have trivial fundamental group: F (M (St )) = {1}.\nThis is also the case for the above R\u03c3t for free products of finitely many finitely generated groups.\nP\nObserve that the \u03b2n (St ) and P\ncost(St ) only depend on those\nP of the free factors, namely: \u03b2n (St ) = i\u2208I \u03b2n (Si )\nfor n 6= 1, and \u03b21 (St ) = |I| + i\u2208I \u03b21 (Si ) and cost(St ) = i\u2208I cost(Si ).\n\n\fRelative Property (T) Actions\n\n2\n\n5\n\nProofs\n\nNotation\n\u2022 R|Y the restriction of R to a Borel subset Y \u2282 X.\n\u2022 Fn the free group on n generators\n\u2022 R\u03b2 the equivalence relation associated with an action \u03b2.\n\u2022 hR1 , R2 , * * * , Rk i the equivalence relation generated by R1 , R2 , * * * , Rk .\n\u2022 h\u03c61 , \u03c62 , * * * , \u03c6n i the equivalence relation generated by the family of partial isomorphisms (\u03c61 , \u03c62 , * * * , \u03c6n ).\n\u2022 dom(\u03c6) and rng(\u03c6) denote the domain and range of the partial isomorphism \u03c6\n\u2022 R1 \u2217 R2 means that R1 , R2 are freely independent, and R = R1 \u2217 R2 that R is generated by the freely\nindependent subrelations R1 and R2\n\u2022 Rp the p-amplification, i.e. the equivalence relation on X \u00d7 {1, 2, * * * , p} defined by (x, j) \u223c (y, k) iff xRy.\nThus, identifying X with X \u00d7 {1},\nRp = R \u2217 h\u03c62 i \u2217 * * * \u2217 h\u03c6p i\n(8)\nwhere \u03c6j : X \u00d7 {1} \u2192 X \u00d7 {j} (j = 2, * * * , p) is the partial isomorphism defined by the identity on the\nfirst coordinate.\nIf R is ergodic, one defines (up to isomorphism) the compression Rt for t \u2208 (0, 1) as the restriction R|Y\nto a (any) subset Y of measure t. The definition extends to any t \u2208 (0, \u221e) by the formula (Rp )s = Rps . This\nis easily shown to be consistent.\nWe now intend to extend such a definition to non ergodic equivalence relations. The reasonnable requirement\nis that Rt \"meets equitably\" almost all the classes of R or all the invariant Borel subsets. It will be defined for\nt \u2208 (0, \u221e) when t times the cardinal of the class |R(x)| belongs to N \u222a {\u221e}, for almost every x \u2208 X.\nA Borel subset B of X is said to be independent of R if it is independent from the \u03c3-algebra of R-invariant\nBorel subsets of X, i.e. for any Borel subset A \u2282 X that is a union of equivalence classes, one has\n\u03bc(A \u2229 B) = \u03bc(A)\u03bc(B).\nProposition-Definition 2.1 (Contraction) Let R be a (non necessarily ergodic) p.m.p. countable standard\nequivalence relation on the standard atomless probability space (X, \u03bc).\n(a) There exists a Borel subset B that is independent of R and has measure \u03bc(B) = t,\n\u2013 for every t \u2208 (0, 1) when R is aperiodic\n\u2013 for every rationnal number t = pq \u2208 (0, 1) p, q \u2208 N such that q divides the cardinal of each class,\notherwise1 .\n(b) If the borel subsets B and C of X are independent of R and satisfy \u03bc(B) = \u03bc(C) = t, then there is a\npartial isomorphism \u03c6 of the full groupoid [[R]] such that \u03c6(B) = C; in particular, the restrictions R|B\nand R|C are isomorphic.\nThis common isomorphism class is denoted by Rt and called the t-contraction of R.\n(c) More generally, for s \u2208 (0, 1) \u222a N\u2217 and t \u2208 (0, 1], the isomorphism class of (Rs )t depends only on the\nproduct r = st as soon as it is defined.

(a) Take (X, \u03bc) to be the interval [0, 1] with Lebesgue measure. Consider the R-ergodic decomposition\nm : (X, \u03bc) \u2192 EM (where EM is the space of R-invariant ergodic measures) (see [Var63] and consider R as\ngiven by a \u2013 non-necessarily free \u2013 group action [FM77a, Th. 1]). Consider, for t \u2208 [0, 1], the Borel subset\nX(t) := {x \u2208 X : m(x)([0, x]) \u2264 t}.\n\n(9)\n\nWhen the classes are infinite, the invariant measures have no atom. It follows that X(t) meets each ergodic\ncomponent along a subset of measure t: for each ergodic measure e \u2208 EM, e(X(t)) = e(X(t) \u2229 m\u22121 (e)) = t.\nIn case the classes are finite, an invariant ergodic measure is just the equiprobability on an equivalence class.\nThe assertion follows easily.\n(b) The proof is analoguous to the ergodic case. Let G be a countable subgroup of the full group [R]\nthat generates R, i.e. for every (x, y) \u2208 R, there is an element g \u2208 G such that g(x) = y [FM77a, Th. 1].\nLet G = {gi }i\u2208N be an enumeration of G. Define B0 := B \u2229 g0\u22121 (C), C0 := g0 (B0 ) and recursively Bi+1 :=\n\u22121\n[B \\ (B0 \u222a B1 \u222a * * * \u222a Bi )] \u2229 gi+1\n[B \\ (C0 \u222a C1 \u222a * * * \u222a Ci )] and Ci+1 := gi+1 (Bi+1 ). Let \u03c6 : \u222ai\u2208N Bi \u2192 \u222ai\u2208N Ci be\nthe partial isomorphism of [[R]] defined by the restrictions \u03c6|Bi = gi |Bi . Consider the complement B \\ \u222ai\u2208N Bi .\nBy construction, its R-saturation B\u0304 does not intersect C \\ \u222ai\u2208N Ci . However, by independence, it intersects B\nand C equiprobably: \u03bc(B\u0304 \u2229 B) = \u03bc(B\u0304 \u2229 C) = \u03bc(B\u0304 \u2229 \u222ai\u2208N Ci ) = \u03bc(\u03c6\u22121 (B\u0304 \u2229 \u222ai\u2208N Ci )) = \u03bc(B\u0304 \u2229 \u222ai\u2208N Bi ). From\nthe equality of the extremal terms, it follows that B\u0304 \u2229 B \\ \u222ai\u2208N Bi is negligeable, and in turn that B\u0304 itself is a\nnull set.\nChecking (c) is a routine calculation.\n\u0003\nWe will use in several points the following useful observation. It renforce T\u00f6rnquist's theorem (Th. 1.4) by\n\"hiding any prescribed free action of a free group\" when putting two relations in general position. For further\napplications, we don't want to require the relations Si to be ergodic.\nLemma 2.2 (Replacement trick) Let S1 , S2 be two p.m.p. countable standard equivalence relations on the\nstandard atomless probability space (X, \u03bc).

In\nparticular, if \u03b2 has the relative property (T) then the resulting S1\u2032 \u2217 S2\u2032 in (12) also.\nIn case S1 and S2 are ergodic, any subset Y of measure p1 works and the assertion (a) is exactly Proposition 7.4 (2) in [IPP08]. The point (b) claims in particular that replacing \u03b1 by any other free Fp\u22121 -action leads\nto another general position between S1 and S2 , hence the name.\nProof of Lemma 2.2. (a) By assumption Si \u2243 (Si |Y )p .

Thus,\nS1 \u2217 S2 = S1 |Y \u2217 S2 |Y \u2217 h\u03c61,2 i \u2217 * * * \u2217 h\u03c61,p i \u2217 h\u03c62,2 i \u2217 * * * \u2217 h\u03c62,p i\n\n(13)\n\n\fRelative Property (T) Actions\n\n7\n\nand (\u03c6i,j )i=1,2;j=2,*** ,p is a treeing (see [Gab00]).

Y2,1 ) belongs to the domains (resp. range) of p \u2212 1 partial isomorphisms of \u03a8.\nThe measurable Hall's marriage theorem [Bol80, Th. 8] shows that there are p \u2212 1 isomorphisms \u03c4l : Y1,1 \u2192 Y2,1\n(l = 1, * * * , p \u2212 1) whose graphs (as subsets of Y1,1 \u00d7 Y2,1 ) form a partitition of the union of the graphs of the\n\u03c8j,k . In other words, up to subdivision, the \u03c8j,k can be assembled in p \u2212 1 isomorphisms Y1,1 \u2192 Y2,1 still\nforming a treeing. Now remembering that Y1,1 = Y2,1 = Y , the map al 7\u2192 \u03c4l defines a free action \u03b1 on Y of the\nfree group F(a1 , * * * , ap\u22121 ) so that\nS1 \u2217 S2\n\n=\n\nS1 |Y \u2217 S2 |Y \u2217 h\u03c61,2 i \u2217 * * * \u2217 h\u03c61,p i \u2217 h\u03c41 i \u2217 * * * \u2217 h\u03c4p\u22121 i\n\n(15)\n\n=\n\nS1 |Y \u2217 S2 |Y \u2217 R\u03b1 \u2217 h\u03c61,2 i \u2217 * * * \u2217 h\u03c61,p i.\n\n(16)\n\nSince (\u03c61,2 , * * * , \u03c61,p ) is a smooth treeing with fundamental domain Y , the assertion follows\n(17)\n\n(S1 \u2217 S2 )|Y = S1 |Y \u2217 S2 |Y \u2217 R\u03b1 .\n\n(b) Let a2 , * * * , ak , * * * , ap be a free generating set for the free group Fp\u22121 and \u03b2(ak ) : Y \u2192 Y the associated\nisomorphisms.
