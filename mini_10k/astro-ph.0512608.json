Introduction\n\ncluster gas can be efficient generators of (random) magnetic\nfields via a process known as the fluctuation dynamo.\n\nWe witness the epoch when galaxy clusters are being formed.\nGalaxies and smaller-size structures have generally achieved\n(quasi-)steady states in their evolution, whereas structures of\nlarger scales keep evolving. There is abundant evidence of\nformation processes in galaxy clusters, including the merger\nof large masses comparable to the cluster mass. Relaxed,\nsymmetric galaxy clusters are rare. Thus, most constituents\nof the clusters keep evolving. Our particular interest here is\nwith motions of the gas and magnetic fields in the intergalactic space of evolving galaxy clusters. The epoch of major\nmergers is notable for widespread, intense random motions,\nfollowed by a period of decaying flows. In a steady state, random motions can be confined to the wakes produced by the\ncluster galaxies and smaller mass subcluster clumps that continue falling into the cluster; as we argue here, these motions\nare likely to occupy a small fraction of the total volume.\n\nThe origin and properties of magnetic field in the intracluster plasma cannot be understood without knowing the nature and parameters of the plasma motions. The reason is that\nthe magnetic Reynolds number in the intracluster gas is large,\nhence magnetic induction effects are strong for any plausible\nspeed of gas motion. Our model of gas motions and magnetic fields in galaxy clusters, presented and justified in detail by Subramanian et al. (2006), is in close agreement with\nthe available data. It predicts that magnetic field in the intracluster gas is represented by magnetic sheets of a thickness\n20\u201330 kpc, with magnetic field strength about 2\u20134 \u03bcG within\nthe sheets. These structures fill about 20% of the volume of a\nsingle turbulent cell. Apart from this intermittent component,\nmagnetic field also has a weaker, widely distributed part.\n\nThe high electrical conductivity of the intracluster gas is\nnot sufficient to ensure the survival of a magnetic field captured by the forming cluster. The reason is that the intracluster\ngas is very viscous, and any inhomogeneous magnetic field\nwould drive gas motions which will rapidly decay, thereby\nconverting magnetic energy into heat. Even for a small viscosity, the field would decay by driving decaying MHD turbulence. On the other hand, random gas motions of the intraCorrespondence to: anvar.shukurov@ncl.ac.uk (AS)\n\nWe propose that, at late stages of cluster evolution, turbulence is confined to the wakes of galaxies and infalling mass\nclumps, and does not fill the volume. However, the area covering factor of the wakes can be close to unity, so most lines\nof sight pass through a turbulent region. This can help to reconcile the available evidence of turbulence in such clusters as\nPerseus with the existence of long filaments in the intracluster\ngas that seem to be inconsistent with pervasive turbulence.\nSince typical lines of sight through a cluster pass through\na small number of turbulent cells, synchrotron emission from\ngalaxy clusters can show a detectable degree of polarization\nat wavelengths 3\u20136 cm.\n\nc 0000 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Snapshots of magnetic field in a cross-section through the middle of the computational domain in a numerical simulation of turbulence driven by an imposed random force and its dynamo action. The left-hand panel shows a statistically\nsteady state at a time t/t0i = 0.30 whereas the right-hand panel illustrates magnetic field structures in turbulence at a late\nstage of decay, t/t0i \u2248 60. Here t0i is the eddy turnover time before the start of the turbulence decay (given in Table 1). The\ndimensionless energy injection scale in these simulations is about 4 (with the domain size of 2\u03c0), so each frame contains a few\nturbulent cells. The strongest magnetic field within the frame is close to the equipartition value with respect to the turbulent\nenergy. The magnitude of the field component perpendicular to the plane of the figure is shown color coded (in shades of\ngrey) with black corresponding to field pointing into the figure plane, and lighter shades, to field pointing out of the plane.\nThe field in the plane of the figure is shown with vectors whose length is proportional to the field strength.\n\n2. Three evolutionary stages\n\nmagnetic field is being amplified by the dynamo, so that the\nmagnetic Prandtl number tends to unity.\n\n2.1. The epoch of major mergers\nTheories of hierarchical structure formation suggest that clusters of galaxies have been assembled relatively recently. N body simulations indicate that the clusters form at the intersection of dark matter filaments in the large-scale structure,\nand result from both major mergers of objects of comparable\nmass (of order 1015 M\u2299 ) and the accretion of smaller clumps\nonto massive protoclusters. It is likely that intense random\nvortical flows, if not turbulence, are produced in the merger\nevents. Their plausible properties are summarized in Table 1.\nThe structure of magnetic field at this stage is illustrated in\nthe left-hand panel of Fig. 1. What is shown is the statistically steady state of magnetic field produced by dynamo action in turbulent flow with the Reynolds number about 400\nand the magnetic Prandtl number equal to unity. Similar magnetic structure plausibly occur in the turbulent wakes of subclusters and galaxies as well.\n\n2.2. Decaying turbulence\nRandom flows produced by major mergers decay after the\nend of the merger event. Unlike a laminar flow that decays\nexponentially in time due to viscosity, turbulent kinetic energy decays slower, as a power law (e.g., Landau & Lifshitz\n1975; Frisch 1995). The reason for this is that kinetic energy\nmainly decays at small scales, to where it is constantly supplied by the turbulent cascade. As a result, the energy decay\nrate depends nonlinearly on the energy itself, which makes\nthe decay a power law in time. Our simulations confirm that\nthe power-law decay occurs even for the Reynolds number as\nsmall as Re \u2248 100. At this stage of evolution, the turbulent\nscale l0 grows with time, whereas turbulent energy density E\nreduces, together with the turbulent speed v0 , typically as\n\nIt is not quite clear whether random flows driven during\nmajor merger events and at later stages of evolution will develop into turbulence. The nature of the flow depends on the\nvalue the Reynolds number which is difficult to estimate reliably for the collisionless, magnetized plasma of the intracluster space where plasma instabilities can be responsible\nfor anomalous viscosity and resistivity (Schekochihin et al.\n2005). The problem is further complicated by the possibility\nof dynamo action, since the magnetic field can affect both viscosity and magnetic diffusivity. This may lead to the growth\nof the magnetic diffusivity and reduction of viscosity as the\n\nE \u2243 21 v02 \u221d (t/t0i )\u22126/5 ,\n\nl0 \u221d (t/t0i )2/5\n\nfor t/t0i \u226b 1 ,\n\nwhere subscript 'i' refers to the start of the evolution, t0i is a\ncertain dynamical time scale, which can be identified with the\ninitial turnover time of the energy-containing eddies, t0i =\nl0i /v0i , subscript '0' refers to the energy-range (correlation)\nscale of the motion.

Furthermore, both fS and fV depend on high powers\nof another poorly known parameter, the stripping radius R0 .\nHence, as noted above, properties of the subcluster wakes can\nbe rather different in apparently similar clusters. In addition,\nnumerical simulations of turbulent wakes should be treated\nwith caution as otherwise reasonable approximations, numerical resolution, and numerical viscosities can strongly affect\nthe results. On the other hand, it is plausible that fS = O(1)\nbut fV \u226a 1, so that a typical line of sight through the cluster\nintersects at least one turbulent region (where our estimate of\nthe r.m.s. turbulent speed is 200\u2013300 km s\u22121) despite the fact\nthat turbulence occurs only in a small fraction of the cluster volume. Thus the presence of long H\u03b1 filaments observed\nby Fabian et al. (2003, 2006) in the core of the Perseus cluster may not be inconsistent with various evidence for random\nmotions in this cluster core (Churazov et al. 2004; Rebusco et\nal. 2006). A possible signature of such spatially intermittent\nturbulence could be a specific shape of spectral lines, with a\nnarrow core, produced in quiescent regions, accompanied by\nnonthermally broadened wings.\nThe area covering factor of galactic wakes within the gas\ncore radius, 180 kpc, is unity if\n\n2.3. Turbulent wakes of subclusters and galaxies\nAt the final stage of the evolution, when the cluster enters a\nsteady state, turbulence is maintained only in the wakes of\ngalaxies and smaller mass clumps that continue to accrete\nonto the cluster. The wakes become weaker as the gas within\nthe clumps or galaxies is stripped by the ram pressure of intracluster gas. The radius of a wake at its head is close to the\nradius within which gas of the mass clump or galaxy remains\nintact. We estimate the stripping radius as R0 \u2243 100 kpc\nfor clumps of a mass 1013 M\u2299 (which fall into a cluster every 3 Gyr) and R0 = 3\u20135 kpc for massive elliptical galaxies. If the flow within the wake becomes turbulent (so that\nit can be described in terms of Prandtl's theory of turbulent\nwakes), the wake length X is controlled by the magnitude of\nthe Reynolds number via\nX/R0 \u2243 (Rei /Recr )3 ,\nwhere Recr \u2248 400 (Tomboulides & Orszag 2000) is the\nmarginal Reynolds number with respect to the onset of turbulence. This value of Recr was obtained for a flow around a\nsolid sphere; Recr for gas spheres is not known. The strong\ndependence of the wake parameters on the Reynolds number\nmakes the estimates somewhat uncertain. On the other hand,\nit implies that galactic wakes can be very sensitive to the detailed parameters of the galactic motion and intergalactic gas,\nso that clusters with very similar parameters can have vastly\ndifferent wake structures.\nThe area covering and volume filling factors, fS and fV ,\nrespectively, of N = 5 wakes, produced by 1013 M\u2299 subclusters, within the virial radius r \u2248 3 Mpc, are estimated as\n!\u22124\n\u0012\n\u00136 \u0012\n\u0013\u22124\nR0\nRecr\n\u03bb\u0303\nN\n,\nfS \u2243 0.15\n5\n100 kpc\n400\n1 kpc\n!\u22125\n\u0012\n\u00138 \u0012\n\u0013\u22125\nN\nR0\nRecr\n\u03bb\u0303\nfV \u2243 0.02\n,\n5\n100 kpc\n400\n1kpc\n\nX/R0 \u2243 30\u201315 ,\n\nX \u2243 100\u201370 kpc ,\n\n(1)\n\nand the volume filling factor of such wakes is fV \u2243 0.07.\nThe length of galactic wakes required to cover the projected\ncluster area, given by Eq. (1), does not seem to be unrealistic. For example, Sakelliou et al. (2005) have observed\na wake behind a massive elliptical galaxy (mass of order\n2 \u00d7 1012 M\u2299 ) moving through the intracluster gas at a speed\nabout vc \u2243 1000 km s\u22121. The length of the detectable wake\nis about X \u2243 130 kpc (assuming that it lies in the sky plane),\nand its mean radius is 40 kpc (obtained from the quoted volume of about 2 \u00d7 106 kpc3 ). The projected area of the wake\nis about 104 kpc2 , as compared to 103 kpc2 for the wake parameters derived above. This wake has been detected only\nbecause it is exceptionally strong, and it is not implausible\nthat weaker but more numerous galactic wakes can cover the\nprojected area of the central parts of galaxy clusters.\nWe conclude that subcluster wakes are likely to be turbulent, but galactic wakes can be laminar if the viscosity of\nthe intracluster gas is as large as Spitzer's value. Given the\n\nwhere N \u2248 5 is consistent with models of hierarchical\nstructure formation, and \u03bb\u0303 is an effective mean free path in\nthe intracluster gas (its introduction is an attempt to allow\nfor our insufficient understanding of viscosity mechanisms).\nThe covering and filling factors strongly depend on \u03bb\u0303 and\n2\n\n\fA. Shukurov, K. Subramanian, N. E. L. Haugen\n\nThe origin and evolution of cluster magnetism\n\nuncertainty of the physical nature (and hence, estimates) of\nthe viscosity of the magnetized intracluster plasma, we suggest that turbulent galactic wakes remain a viable possibility.\nBoth types of wake have low volume filling factor but can\nhave an area covering factor of order unity. Parameters of turbulence and magnetic fields produced within the wakes are\ngiven in the last two lines of Table 1.\n\nsion scale, but now based on the critical value of the magnetic\nReynolds number,\n\u22121/2\nlB \u2243 l0 Rm,cr\n.\n\nThis scale is given in Table 1 for various stages of evolution,\ntogether with the magnetic field within magnetic structures,\nBeq and the resulting r.m.s. magnetic field within a turbulence cell, Brms . Table 1 also contains estimates of the r.m.s.\nvalue of the Faraday rotation measure, \u03c3RM produced in the\ndynamo-generated magnetic field; the estimates agree with\nobservations fairly well. Our numerical simulations of the\nfluctuation dynamo, where we directly measure \u03c3RM , also\nconfirm our semi-analytical estimates.\nOur model implies that the correlation scale of random\nmotions in the intracluster gas, l0 , is larger than that assumed\nearlier. With l0 \u2243 150 kpc (Table 1), only 5 turbulent cells\noccur along a path length of L = 750 kpc. The resulting degree of polarization of radio emission from clusters with synchrotron halos can be estimated as p \u2243 12 p0 /n1/2 \u2243 0.2,\nwhere p0 \u2248 0.7, n \u2243 L/l0 is the number of magnetic\nstructures along the line of sight (assuming that one magnetic sheet with well-ordered magnetic field occurs in each\nturbulent cell and that the linear resolution is better than\nl0 ), and a factor 1/2 allows, in a very approximate manner, for the volume-filling magnetic field outside the magnetic sheet which only produces unpolarized emission. Depolarization by Faraday dispersion and beam depolarization\ncan reduce the degree of polarization to a fraction of percent\nat long wavelengths. However, polarization observations at\nwavelengths 3\u20136 cm (where Faraday depolarization is sufficiently weak) can reveal magnetic structures produced by the\ndynamo action if the angular resolution is high enough. Such\nobservations can become feasible for many galaxy clusters\nwith the advent of the SKA (Feretti & Johnston-Hollitt 2004).\n\n3. Intracluster magnetic fields and their\nobservational signatures\nA random flow of electrically conducting fluid (either turbulent or not) can generate and maintain magnetic field if the\nmagnetic Reynolds number Rm = v0 l0 /\u03b7 exceeds a certain critical value, Rm > Rm,cr where Rm,cr depends on the\nstatistical properties of the flow and usually remains within\nthe range Rm,cr = 30\u2013100 (here \u03b7 is the magnetic diffusivity). This condition is undoubtedly satisfied in the intracluster\nplasma, where Rm \u226b 1 (unlike the kinematic Reynolds number Re which may be quite modest), and so the dynamo action in galaxy clusters is more than plausible. This type of dynamo, known as the fluctuation dynamo because it produces\nfluctuating magnetic fields with zero mean value, does not require any overall rotation, density stratification, \u03b1-effect, etc.\nReviews of fluctuation dynamos can be found in Zeldovich et\nal. (1990) and Brandenburg & Subramanian (2005).\nAt an early stage of the dynamo action, when magnetic\nfields are still too weak to affect the flow, magnetic energy\ndensity grows exponentially. The e-folding time of the r.m.s.\nmagnetic field generated by motions of a scale l and speed v\nis of the order of \u03c4 \u2243 l/v. In Kolmogorov turbulence (and in\nany random flow with a sufficiently steep energy spectrum),\nthe e-folding time is shorter at smaller scales, so that magnetic energy spectrum has maximum at small scales, close\n\u2212d\nto the magnetic diffusion scale l\u03b7 = l0 Rm\nwith d = 1/2\n(Kazantsev 1967; Zeldovich et al. 1990; Schekochihin et al.\n2004) or d = 3/4 for the marginal mode in Kolmogorov turbulence (Brandenburg & Subramanian 2005 and references\ntherein). Thus, magnetic field is concentrated into magnetic\nsheets (and filaments) of thickness l\u03b7 and length of order l0 .\nThe field strength within the magnetic structures is, at saturation, close to equipartition with kinetic energy, B \u2243 Beq =\n(4\u03c0\u03c1v02 )1/2 , where \u03c1 is the gas density. An application of\nthis theory to galaxy clusters is discussed by Ruzmaikin et\nal. (1989), although these authors presumed that turbulence\nproduced in galactic wakes can be volume-filling.\n\nReferences\nBrandenburg, A., Subramanian, K.: 2005, Phys.
