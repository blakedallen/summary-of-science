In Kerr media where the paraxial propagation is\ndescribed by the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger (NLS) equation,\nonly one soliton solution exists once the parameters (i.e.,\nnonlinearity and peak intensity or width) are fixed and\nthat solution is stable. However, more general nonlinear\nresponses can result into bistability of solitons (strictly\nspeaking solitary waves) and/or their instability against\nthe growth of weak perturbations.\nIn this paper we are interested to investigate such features for solitons sitting on a finite background (i.e., darklike) in the context of the Cubic-Quintic NLS (CQNLS)\nwith a defocusing cubic and focusing quintic nonlinear\nresponse. The importance of such model lies in the fact\nthat it constitutes the simplest model for a defocusing\nsaturable Kerr effect [1, 2], whose parameters can be effectively measured in a relatively simple way by two-wave\ncoupling or Z-scan [3, 4].\nAs far as bistability is concerned, the case of dark\nsolitons has been investigated with reference to various\nmodel including the CQNLS [2, 5\u20139]. In particular Hermann has shown that dark solitons exhibit bistability of\nthe second kind, i.e. characterized by solutions possessing the same full-width-half-maximum (FWHM), albeit\npossessing different amplitudes (and generally invariants\nof motion). This type of bistability was introduced in\nRefs. [10, 11] by Gatz and Hermann, to distinguish it\nfrom the earlier definition [12\u201314] which implies the existence of different solutions possessing the same value\nof one invariant of motion (e.g., the power) for different\nvalues of the internal parameter, typically the nonlinear\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nhttp:www.primalight.org; andrea.fratalocchi@kaust.edu.sa\nstefano.trillo@unife.it\n\npropagation constant \u03b2. The analysis carried out by Herrmann, however, is limited to stationary solitons, while a\nfull family of moving dark solitons can exist. The analysis is further complicated by the fact that the CQNLS in\nthe regime considered here is known to possess coexisting\nantidark (or bright on pedestal) solutions [9, 15]. The full\nfamily of dark and antidark solitons, once parametrized\nby the velocity, exhibits intriguing features which have\nbeen overlooked, and which we discuss below. Furthermore, whether the full family of the dark-antidark moving pairs is stable or not, and which are the instability\nmechanisms is still an open problem. Our systematic investigation of these problems provides two answers: (i) it\nshows that the criterium demonstrated by Barashenkov\n[16] for dark solitons provides the correct exhaustive answer to the stability problem also for antidark solitons;\n(ii) it clarifies that the decay of antidark solitons can\nfollow new scenarios in proper regions of the parameter\nspace, rather than always blowing-up as conjectured in\nthe previous literature, though collapse is in general allowed even in 1+1D because of the high power of the\nfocusing term.\nBesides being important per se, the knowledge of the\ndynamics of the whole soliton family of the CQNLS is\nalso important in view of recent studies which extend\nthe investigation of competing nonlinearities to the nonparaxial [17] and nonlocal [18, 19] regimes. Moreover, the\nfull characterization of the soliton solutions and their instabilities constitute the starting ground for describing\nthe feature of dispersive shock waves (DSW, involving\nmultiple solitons in the weakly dispersive regime) [20],\nan active area of research where succesful experiments\nhave been recently performed in non-Kerr media under\ndifferent excitation conditions [21\u201323]. In this respect,\nhere we provide the first prediction of a dispersive shock\nwave produced directly by the decay of a solitary wave\nof the CQNLS model.\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nDARK-ANTIDARK SOLUTIONS\n\nWe start from the (dimensionless) CQNLS equation:\ni\n\n\u2202u 1 \u2202 2 u\n\u03b1 4\n2\n\u2212 |u| u + |u| u = 0,\n+\n\u2202z\n2 \u2202x2\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhich describes a saturable Kerr-like nonlinearity\nthrough its truncated expansion at second-order in the\n2\nnormalized intensity |u| , with \u03b1 being an external free\nparameter that weights the quintic nonlinear response\n(the smaller \u03b1, the weaker the saturation effect). Solitons of such system have been reported before. However, we reformulate the full problem from the beginning, giving novel analytical formulas which prove convenient for the purpose of our analysis. Solitons correspond to translationally\ninvariant solutions of the the\np\nform u(z, x) = \u03c1(\u03b8) exp [i\u03c6(\u03b8) + i\u03b2z], where \u03b8 = x \u2212 vz\nand \u03b2 = g(\u03c10 ) is the nonlinear phase shift experienced by\na plane-wave background with intensity \u03c10 \u2261 |u0 |2 , in the\nmedium where the nonlinear refractive index varies with\n2\nintensity \u03c1 = |u| according to the law g(\u03c1) = \u2212\u03c1+\u03b1\u03c12 /2.\nThese solutions depend on two internal parameters which\nwe choose, in analogy to general dark soliton solutions\nof the defocusing NLS equation, as \u03c10 (intensity background, which fixes also \u03b2) and v (soliton velocity, which\nfixes also the darkness or brightness of the soliton). Note\nthat, here, the quintic term prevents the simple rescaling\nto \u03c10 = 1 without rescaling \u03b1, and the velocity complicates further the scenario, so we keep the three parameters free. The modulus \u03c1 plays the role of equivalent\n\"position\", and obeys the standard Hamiltonian dynamics with \"momentum\" p = \u03c1\u0307 \u2261 d\u03c1/d\u03b8,\n\u2202H\np2\n\u2202H\n, \u03c1\u0307 =\n; H=\n+ V (\u03c1),\n\u2202\u03c1\n\u2202p\n2\n(2)\n\u0014\n\u0015\n2\n\u03b1\nc\nV = 2\u03c1 (\u03c13 \u2212 \u03c130 ) \u2212 (\u03c12 \u2212 \u03c120 ) + 2k0 (\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c10 ) \u2212 0 .\n3\n\u03c10\n\ndark and antidark solitons that corresponds to the motion along the left well \u03c1m \u2264 \u03c1 \u2264 \u03c10 (dark solitons), and\nthe right well \u03c10 \u2264 \u03c1 \u2264 \u03c1a (antidark solitons), respectively. Here \u03c1m \u2264 \u03c10 \u2264 \u03c1a are the roots of V (\u03c1) \u2212 E\n(explicit expressions of \u03c1m , \u03c1a are reported in Appendix\nA). In terms of such roots, we derive (see Appendix A)\nthe following explicit solutions for dark solitons:\n\u03c1d (\u03b8) =\n\n\u03c1m + r\u03c1a tanh2 [w(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b80 )]\n,\n1 + r tanh2 [w(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b80 )]\n\n(4)\n\nwhere r = (\u03c10 \u2212 \u03c1m )/(\u03c1a \u2212 \u03c10 ) and w =\np\n\u03b1(\u03c1a \u2212 \u03c10 )(\u03c10 \u2212 \u03c1m )/3 is the inverse soliton width,\nwhile the minimum intensity (dip) is given by the root\n\u03c1 = \u03c1m . Similarly for anti-dark solitons, we obtain\n\u03c1a (\u03b8) =\n\n\u03c1a + 1r \u03c1m tanh2 [w(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b80 )]\n1+\n\n1\nr\n\ntanh2 [w(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b80 )]\n\n,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere r and w are the same as for dark solitons.\n\n\u1e57 = \u2212\n\n2\n\nHere c0 = v\u03c10 and k0 = v2 + \u03c10 \u2212 \u03b12 \u03c120 . Once \u03c1(\u03b8) is\nobtained by solving Eqs. (2), the phase profile \u03c6(\u03b8) can\nbe found by integrating the following equation:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c10\n\u03c6\u0307 = v 1 \u2212\n.\n(3)\n\u03c1\nA.\n\nSoliton solutions\n\nSoliton solutions sitting on the plane-wave background\n\u03c1 = \u03c10 correspond to homoclinic separatrix trajectories\nof Eqs.

Such separatrices emanate from the\nsaddle point (\u03c1, p) = (\u03c10 , 0) of the Hamiltonian H(\u03c1, p).\nFor \u03b1 6= 0, the potential V (\u03c1) \u2212 E is a double well corresponding to a double-loop separatrix as shown in Fig.\n1(a,b). Therefore one has, in general, a coexisting pair of\n\nFIG. 1.

Note the vertical log scale in (b).\n\nAs an example, we show in Fig. 3 how the typical\nphase plane (potential) changes when \u03b1 is varied between zero and the critical value \u03b1c . In this case we\nchoose \u03c10 = 1 and still solitons, viz. v = 0, yielding\n\u03c1m = 0 which means that the dark soliton is black regardless of the value of \u03b1, while the antidark is characterized by a peak intensity \u03c1a = 3/\u03b1 \u2212 2\u03c10 . In the\nlimit \u03b1 = 0 shown in Fig. 3(a,b), which represents the\nideal Kerr case, the potential is cubic, and the separatrix has only one branch corresponding to the well-known\nblack soliton solution (\u03c1 = tanh2 (x)) of the NLS equation, whereas for \u03c1 > 1 the motion is unbounded and\nno coexisting antidark solutions do exist. In fact the unbounded motion for \u03c1 > 1 can be thought of as the motion in the right well that, however, becomes infinitely\n\n\f4\ndeep [V (\u03b8 = \u221e) \u2192 \u2212\u221e)] and wide (since \u03c1a \u2192 \u221e).\nViceversa, as \u03b1 grows from zero, the behavior of the potential at \u03b8 = \u221e is inverted, and the right well becomes\nfinite, allowing for a eight-shaped separatrix corresponding to the dark-antidark pair [see Fig. 3(c-d)]. For small\nvalues of \u03b1 the antidark soliton has high peak intensity \u03c1a\nabove the background \u03c10 , which, however, decreases as\nthe saturation parameter \u03b1 increases. For \u03b1 approaching\nits critical value \u03b1c antidark solitons become shallow [see\nFig. 3(e-f)], until they reduce to the plane wave exactly\nat \u03b1 = \u03b1c , where \u03c1a \u2192 \u03c10 .

The dashed lines give the critical condition\n\u03b1c (\u03c10 , v).\n\nsolitons with velocity exhibits intriguing features, which\ncan be gathered by plotting the minimum (dip) intensity\n\u03c1m of dark solitons (the larger \u03c1m , the lower the darkness) and the peak intensity \u03c1a of antidark solitons (the\nhigher \u03c1a , the brighter the antidark) versus v at constant\n\u03c10 , for different values of \u03b1, as displayed in Fig. 4. For\nnon-zero but small velocities, the picture remains qualitatively unchanged with respect to the case v = 0, in the\nsense that the peak intensity \u03c1a of antidark solitons decreases continuously from infinity (at \u03b1 = 0) to \u03c1a = \u03c10\nat the critical value \u03b1c , such that the solitons become\ninfinitely shallow (i.e. they reduce to a pure plane wave).\nIn this case, however, the dip intensity of dark solitons\nis no longer zero, i.e. they becomes gray solitons with\ndarkness \u03c10 \u2212 \u03c1m . The darkness decreases for growing\nvelocities p\nv up to a minimum value at the bound velocity vc = \u03c10 \u2212 \u03b1\u03c120 (obtained by solving Eq. (9) with\nrespect to v for fixed \u03b1). This is clearly shown in Fig.\n4, where we summarize the result for a fixed background\n\u03c10 = 1. Note from Fig. 4(a) that Kerr (NLS) dark solitons (\u03b1 = 0) are always darker than the corresponding\n\nCQNLS solitons of the same velocity (the curve \u03c1m (v)\nfor \u03b1 = 0 is always below the other curves relative to\n\u03b1 6= 0), and have also a larger phase jump \u2206\u03a6 than their\nCQNLS counterparts.\nInterestingly, however, as the velocity grows large\nenough (above v = 0.5 in Fig. 4), it turns out that\ndark solitons can become infinitely shallow at the cut-off\ncondition for their existence (\u03c1a \u2192 \u03c10 and hence darkness tends to zero). Conversely, under the same conditions, antidark solitons cease to become infinitely shallow, rather reaching a finite minimum peak intensity at\nthe cut-off condition for their existence [see Fig. 4(b)].\nFrom Fig. 4(b) it is also clear that, for small \u03b1 the brightness of antidark solitons is nearly independent on the\nvelocity. This change of behavior at the cut-off condition for the existence (from infinitely shallow antidark to\ninfinitely shallow dark solitons) depends the background\n\u03c10 . It can be shown to occur at the value of \u03b10 = 3/(4\u03c10 ),\n\u221a\nin correspondence of the velocity v0 = \u03c10 /2 (in Fig. 4,\n\u03b10 = 0.75 and v0 = 0.5).\nThe coexistence of dark and antidark solitons constitute a bistable mechanism such that two different solutions exist with same parameters (\u03c10 and v) and different renormalized invariants M, H, P (see Appendix A\nfor their definition). However these soliton families can\nbe bistable also according to the definition by Gatz and\nHerrmann, i.e. for fixed \u03b1 different solutions of the same\nwidth can exist although they sit on a different background \u03c10 . This type of bistability was investigated for\nstill (v = 0) dark solitons [7]. In order to generalize this\nresult to the full family (any v, and antidark case), we\nhave calculated the FWHM as\n\u03b8F W HM =\n\np\n2\ntanh\u22121 f (\u03c10 , \u03c1m , \u03c1a ),\nw\n\n(10)\n\na \u2212\u03c10\nfor dark solitons\nwhere f (\u03c10 , \u03c1m , \u03c1a ) = 2\u03c1a\u03c1\u2212\u03c1\n0 \u2212\u03c1m\n(FWHM taken at half the intensity between \u03c10 and the\n\u03c10 \u2212\u03c1m\ndip \u03c1m ) and f (\u03c10 , \u03c1m , \u03c1a ) = \u03c1a +\u03c1\nfor antidark soli0 \u22122\u03c1m\ntons (FWHM at half the intensity between \u03c10 and the\npeak \u03c1a ), respectively. The results obtained by mapping\n\u03b8F W HM in the plane (\u03b1, \u03c10 ) are summarized in Fig. 5.\nAs shown, dark solitons exhibit bistability for sufficiently\nlarge \u03b1, regardless of their velocity. However the range\nof values of \u03b1 where bistability occurs is greatly reduced\nfor large velocities [see Fig. 5(c)]. Conversely, as shown\nin Fig. 5(d), antidark solitons are never bistable in the\nsame sense (no folding of the level curves of \u03b8F W HM is\never observed at any velocity).\n\nIII.\n\nINSTABILITY SCENARIOS\n\nHaving characterized the features of dark-antidark soliton pairs, we discuss their stability. We proceed by applying a known stability criterium according to which the\nstability is related to the derivative of the invariant momentum M (see Appendix A) of the soliton against its\n\n\f5\n2\n\n1\n(b)\nHamiltonian H\n\nmomentum M\n\n(a)\n1.5\ndark\n1\n0.5\n0\n0\n\nv\n\nc\n\nantidark\n0.3\nvelocity v\n\n0.8\nantidark\n\n0.6\n\ndark\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n1\n1.5\nmomentum M\n\n2\n\nFIG. 6.

Therefore the whole family of dark solitons is stable in its existence domain, a conclusion that is fully supported by our numerical simulation of the propagation.\nViceversa instabilities take place for antidark solitons.\nIn particular, for small \u03b1, it turns out that they are always unstable in the whole domain of existence since\nM (v) exhibits always positive slope. Conversely at sufficiently large \u03b1, the momentum M (v) changes its slope\nnear the cut-off value for existence vc . This is shown in\nFig. 6, where we compare the momentum M (v) for dark\nand antidark solitons at \u03b1 = 0.7 and \u03c10 = 1. Note that\nthe change of slope of the momentum means that two\nantidark solutions with same momentum and different\nvelocity exist. These two solutions differ by their Hamiltonian H (see Appendix for its expression). Indeed, as\nshown in Fig. 6(b) the Hamiltonian H as a function of\nM is folded, showing an upper (unstable) branch and a\nlower (stable) branch.\n\n\u03b1m\n\n0.2\n0.5\n1\nvelocity v\n\n1.5\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n1\nvelocity v\n\n1.5\n\nFIG. 7.

Such criterium, proved by Barashenkov [16]\nfor dark solitons of the generalized NLS equation is found\nto account also for the instabilities of antidark solitons.\nWe emphasize, however, that such criterium accounts for\nreal eigenvalues crossing into the right-half plane (usually\nbifurcating from zero eigenvalues associated with neutral\nmodes, i.e. symmetries of the model). Other instability mechanisms such as oscillatory instabilities resulting\nfrom edge bifurcations leading to pairs of complex conjugate eigenvalues entering the right-half plane, need an\nindependent characterization. However, we have found\n(numerically) no evidence for instabilities of such kind.\nMoreover, the condition for the existence of solitons [Eq.\n(9)] turns out to coincide with the region where the background plane-wave is modulationally stable. Therefore\nthe condition (11) turns out to be an exhaustive criterium\nto assess the linear stability of all the solutions presented\nso far.\nThe calculation of the function M (v) for dark soliton\nfamily shows that such function has always a negative\n\nFIG. 8.

The results of Fig. 6\ncould be repeated for different values of \u03c10 and \u03b1, and\nsummarized by drawing stability maps in the plane v, \u03b1\nat constant \u03c10 .

In particular stability requires \u03b1 > \u03b1m , where \u03b1m\ncorresponds to the vertex of the stability island [see Fig.\n7]. In order to test the validity of the marginal stability\ncondition we have made extensive simulations performed\nby means of the well-known split-step method. Such simulations confirm indeed that \u2202v M = 0 gives the threshold\nfor stability also for antidark solitons. The numerics also\nreveal two basic mechanisms of instability, which are illustrated below by means of numerical runs performed\nby launching the exact soliton profile, while the pertur-\n\nbation arises from intrinsic roundoff and discretization\nerrors.\nThe first scenario is valid for relatively large \u03b1, such\nthat a stable range of velocities exists. As an example for illustration purpose, we have chosen \u03b1 = 0.7,\n\u03c10 = 1, which yield a range of stable velocities v =\n(0.4644, 0.5477) [see Fig. 6(a)]. The dynamics for three\ndifferent values of v, marked by bullets in the map of Fig.\n7(a), is displayed in Fig. 8. As shown in Fig. 8(a), for\nv = 0.5 the antidark soliton propagates in stable fashion.\nConversely, when v is decreased just below the threshold\nfor instability [v = 0.4 in Fig. 8(b)], the initial soliton\ndecays into a different antidark soliton of higher velocity,\nwhich is stable. However, for lower velocities, such that\nthe soliton lies far from the threshold for stability, the\ndecay into a pair of stable antidark soliton is observed,\na process which is accompanied by radiation. Note that\nthe instabilities are extremely long-range in both cases,\ni.e. they become manifest only after tens of diffraction\nlengths. As shown in Fig. 8(c), the two antidark solitons\nare symmetric in the limit v = 0 in such a way that the\ninitial zero momentum is conserved, otherwise they appear to be asymmetric (case not shown). The scenario\nillustrated in Fig. 8 holds also for different values of \u03b1,\nproviding \u03b1 > \u03b1m , i.e. a stable range of velocities exists. It is interesting to note that the value \u03c10 = 3/(4\u03c10 ),\nwhich discriminates the fact that antidark solitons can\nbe or not infinitely shallow at cut-off, lies in the region\nof stability for any \u03c10 (see dot-dashed lines in Fig. 7).\nTherefore antidark solitons with arbitrarily small brightness that exist for \u03b1 > \u03b10 around cut-off, are always\nstable, whereas antidark solitons which have finite brightness at cut-off can propagate stably only for \u03b1 > \u03b1m .\nThe scenario discussed above change qualitatively\nwhen \u03b1 < \u03b1m , where the island of stability shrinks to\nzero. In this case the decay instability towards other antidark solitons is forbidden because no stable solutions\nexist. In this case, the only stable solutions are dark solitons and therefore the decay instability occurs towards\nthese solutions, even though their shape differ dramatically (indeed being \"opposite\") from the input antidark\nshape. Importantly when \u03b1 is small (weak saturation)\nthe antidark solitons possess large amplitude and large\npower Pa (or number of particles, see Appendix for its\ndefinition). Under these conditions we have found that\nthe decay instability of the antidark leads to a DSW\n(see Refs. [20\u201323] and references therein), i.e. an expanding region filled with fast oscillations which behave\nasympotically as solitons. In the present case, starting\nwith a zero-velocity antidark soliton, the decay instability leads to two symmetric DSW fans, as displayed in\nFig. 9 for \u03b1 = 0.1. In each of the two fans, the inner\nedge is set by the darkest and slowest soliton, whereas\non the outer edge the fan is linked to the plane wave\nthrough a train of solitons with progressively decreasing\ndarkness and increasing velocity, which become denser as\nthe background is approached. Although this behavior is\nreminiscent of that ruled by the integrable NLS equation\n\n\f7\n(limit \u03b1 = 0) in the semiclassical regime (i.e., nonlinearity much stronger than diffraction/dispersion) under\nexcitation of e.g. a gaussian on pedestal [21], it must\nbe emphasized that this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first example where the dispersive shock waves\noccurs directly through the decay of an unstable solitary\nwave of the system. Further characterization of the shock\nfan need to develop the Whitham modulational theory\nfor the system, which is beyond the scope of this paper.\nHowever, simple arguments based on the features of solitons as shown in Fig. 4, let us predict that the fan ruled\nby Eq. (1) is narrower as compared to the one ruled by\nthe integrable NLS equation under the same excitation.\nThis is due to the fact that the soliton with vanishingly\nsmall darkness, constituting the outer edge of the fan,\ncorrespond to progressively reduced velocity as the quintic nonlinearity grows (i.e., \u03b1 increases), as clearly shown\nin Fig. 4(a).\nThe decay scenario shown in Fig. 9 does not change\nwhen starting with an antidark soliton with non-zero velocity (v, M 6= 0), except that the two shock fans become\nasymmetric (the higher the velocity, the higher the asymmetry), in both the number of solitons and the velocity\nof the darkest soliton (inner edge of the fan), as shown\nin Fig. 10. This asymmetry is definitely expected, based\non the fact that a symmetric configuration would have\nM = 0 and hence would lead to violation of momentum\nconservation. Moreover the asymmetric development of\nthe shock is analogous to DSW generated in the integrable NLS limit when starting from a gray beam with\nnon-zero velocity and momentum [23].\nFinally we point out that, for larger \u03b1, yet with \u03b1 < \u03b1c ,\nthe scenario remains qualitatively unchanged though the\nnumber of dark solitons generated in the decay of the\nantidark soliton decreases.\nThough the aim of this paper was the full characterization of solitary waves sitting on a finite background, before concluding, we point out that such solitons can also coexist with bright solitary waves with\nzero pedestal.\np Seeking for bright solitons of the form\nu(x, z) =\n\u03c1(x) exp(i\u03b2z), a simple calculation shows\nthat the peakp\nintensity of these solutions turns out to\nbe \u03c1a = 3(1 + 1 + 8\u03b2\u03b1/3)/(2\u03b1). The existence domain\nof such solutions include arbitrarily small \u03b1, and hence\nthey coexist with dark-antidark pairs. Given the defocusing nature of the leading order (cubic) nonlinearity\nthis might appear surprising. However, it is not difficult\nto understand that such bright solitons are sustained entirely by the quintic focusing nonlinearity since \u03c1a diverges in the limit \u03b1 \u2192 0, where the quintic nonlinearity\nvanishes indeed. Without deepening the study of the\nbright case, already investigated in the framework of the\nCQNLS equation, we expect them to be unstable at least\nin the limit of small \u03b1, where they do not affect the decay\ndynamics of antidark solitons or the stable dynamics of\ndark solitons discussed above.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn summary we have discussed the main properties of\nsolitary solutions with finite background of the CQNLS\nequation with focusing quintic term. Bistability and instabilities have been studied for the full family of solutions obtained in new analytical form, and parametrized\nby the intensity of the background wave and the velocity.\nWe have found that the solutions exhibit a non-trivial\nbehavior against the velocity such that, depending on\nthe value of the quintic nonlinearity, either dark or antidark solitons, become infinitely shallow at their bound\nfor existence. Furthermore dark solitons are bistable for\nany velocity, whereas antidark are never bistable. Finally\ndark solitons are stable against weak perturbations while\nantidark are mostly unstable, exhibiting different mechanisms of instability. In particular, a novel mechanism involving the decay of an antidark soliton into a dispersive\nshock wave has been characterized. Further work will be\ndevoted to assess how the quintic nonlinearity affects the\nformation and dynamics of dispersive shock waves which\ndevelop from more general (non-solitary) inputs. Potentially also the collapse, i.e. blow-up at a finite distance\n(which is known to occur even in the 1+1D case that we\ndealt with, owing to the high order of the focusing term\n[26, 27]) could play a substantial role that needs further\ninvestigation.\nFrom the experimental point of view, the most natural\nsetting for testing these results is the study of paraxial beam evolution in nonlinear optics of centrosymmetric media, where the quintic term accounts for the saturation of the Kerr nonlinear index n2 (n2 < 0, defocusing media), usually quantified in terms of the highorder nonlinear index n4 [7], the overall index change\nbeing \u2206n = \u2212|n2 |I + n4 I 2 , where I is the optical intensity. While the nonlinear indexes n2 , n4 (or equivalently the nonlinear susceptibilities) depends solely on\nmaterial properties and can be accurately characterized\nby means of consolidated techniques [3, 4], the normalized coefficient \u03b1 used throughout the paper turns out to\ndepend on the input intensity as well, and hence the impact of the quintic nonlinearity can be tuned by changing\nthe optical power [17]. An other area where the predictions based on the present model can be relevant and\ncan lead to experimental test, is the dynamics of ultracold atoms (Bose-Einstein condensates), where the quintic term arises from higher-order (three-body) atom interactions [28], and tuning of the nonlinearities can be\nachieved by means of Feshback resonances.\n\n\f8\nV.\n\nAPPENDIX A\n\nAnalytical solutions can be worked out from the equation which follows directly from Eq.

Explicitly, the\nextremal roots \u03c1m , \u03c1a are expressed by:\np\n3 \u2212 2\u03b1\u03c10 \u2212 (3 \u2212 2\u03b1\u03c10 )2 \u2212 12v 2 \u03b1\n,\n\u03c1m =\np 2\u03b1\n3 \u2212 2\u03b1\u03c10 + (3 \u2212 2\u03b1\u03c10 )2 \u2212 12v 2 \u03b1\n\u03c1a =\n.\n(14)\n2\u03b1\n\nOnce the soliton solutions are known one can easily calculate the renormalized invariants (momentum, Hamiltonian) which are defined as follows\ni\n2\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e\n\n+\u221e\n\n\"\n\n|ux |2\n+\n2\n\nM=\n\nH=\n\nZ\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c10\ndx,\n(u\u2217x u \u2212 ux u\u2217 ) 1 \u2212\n\u03c1\n\n(15)\n\n#\n\n(16)\n\nZ\n\n\u03c1(x)\n\n\u03c10\n\n[g(\u03c10 ) \u2212 g(\u03c1)]d\u03c1 dx,\n\nand the power or number of particles, Pa (antidark) and\nPd (dark):\nPa =\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n|u|2 \u2212 \u03c10 dx; Pd =\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u03c10 \u2212 |u|2 dx(17)\n\nThe quantities M and H are those employed in the text\nto assess the stability of soliton solutions.\n\nVI.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nNote that, in the limit v = 0, the smaller root \u03c1m vanishes, and as a consequence the dark soliton becomes a\nblack soliton.\n\nS.
