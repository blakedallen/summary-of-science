In e+ e\u2212\ncollisions, the prospects for discovering neutral Higgs bosons are investigated within the context of the NMSSM with explicit CP violation when the dominant component of the lightest\nneutral Higgs boson is the Higgs singlet field of the NMSSM.\n\n1\n\n\fI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn the standard model, the phenomenology of CP violation is described in terms of a complex\nphase in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) mixing matrix for quarks [1]. The source of\nthe complex phase is not clarified in the standard model. If there are two Higgs doublets in the\nmodel, the complex phase might originate from the Higgs sector. As the supersymmetrically\nextended versions of the standard model require at least two Higgs doublets [2], to give separate\nmasses for the up-type quarks and the down-type quarks, they are regarded as natural candidates\nfor explaining the origin of CP violation. This is all the more because supersymmetry is broken\nin nature at the electroweak scale. One would obtain no CP phase in the Higgs sector if\nsupersymmetry is intact.\nIn supersymmetric standard models, the CP violation can occur in the neutral Higgs sector\nthrough the mixing between the scalar and pseudoscalar Higgs bosons. In principle, it can\nbe accomplished either spontaneously or explicitly. Either way, the phenomenology of the CP\nviolation in the supersymmetric standard models is considered as particularly useful probes of\nnew physics at the high energy scale because CP violation only appears through the CKM matrix\nin the standard model. Recently, the attempts to explain the source of the CP violation within\nthe context of supersymmetry have been investigated by many authors [3-5].\nIn the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM), many authors have investigated\nif it is possible to violate the CP symmetry either spontaneously [3] or explicitly [4,5]. It is\nfound that the tree level Higgs potential of the MSSM is unable to break the CP symmetry in\neither way. Further investigations at the 1-loop level of the MSSM show that the scenario of\nspontaneous CP violation is experimentally ruled out by the Higgs search at the CERN e+ e\u2212\ncollider LEP, because it leads to a very light neutral Higgs boson [3]. However, at the 1-loop level,\nthe scenario of explicit CP violation in the MSSM is found to be viable through the radiatively\ncorrected Higgs potential. Subsequently, a number of investigations have been devoted to the\neffects of explicit CP violation in the MSSM at the 1-loop level to the charged Higgs boson\nas well as to the neutral ones by considering radiative corrections due to the third generation\nquark and scalar quark contributions [4]. Recently the MSSM searches for explicit CP violation\nwere extended to radiative corrections due to the W boson, the charged Higgs boson, and to\nthe chargino contribution [5].\nMeanwhile, the CP symmetry may also be broken if the Higgs sector is extended by introducing at least one Higgs singlet. The supersymmetric standard models with additional neutral\nHiggs singlets can evade some of the strong constraints of the MSSM. These models may be\nclassified according to whether they have a discrete symmetry or not. It is known that for those\nmodels without a discrete Z3 symmetry, spontaneous CP violation is possible at the tree level\n[6] and up to the 1-loop level including radiative corrections due to the top and scalar top quark\nloops [7]. On the other hand, those models with discrete symmetry can cause a domain problem\nassociated with the existence of degenerate vacua after the electroweak phase transition [8]. The\npossible domain wall problem is assumed to be solved by adding nonrenormalizable interactions\nwhich break the Z3 symmetry without spoiling the quantum stability [9]. Among those with a\ndiscrete Z3 symmetry on its Higgs potential, the simplest model, with just one Higgs singlet,\nis usually called as the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model (NMSSM) [10]. The\nNMSSM is basically different from the MSSM in that it has one extra Higgs singlet.\nFor spontaneous CP violation, it is well known that the NMSSM, which has Z3 symmetry\nin its Higgs potential cannot produce spontaneous CP violation at the tree level, because of\nvacuum stability [11]. This behavior does not change by taking into account the contributions\n2\n\n\fof the degenerate scalar top quark loops [12]. Spontaneous CP violation can only occur if the\nscalar top quark masses at the 1-loop effective potential are nondegenerate [13]. However, at the\ntree level, unlike the MSSM, the scenario of explicit CP violation is possible for the NMSSM.\nBy assuming the degeneracy of the top scalar quark masses in the Higgs sector of the NMSSM,\nit is found that large explicit CP violation may be realized as the vacuum expectation value\n(VEV) of the neutral Higgs singlet approaches the electroweak scale [14].\nIn a previous article [15], we have analyzed the phenomenology of explicit CP violation in the\nHiggs sector of the NMSSM at the 1-loop level. Using the effective potential method, we have\nincluded the radiative corrections due to quarks and scalar quarks of the third generation. We\nhave found that there are parameter regions of the NMSSM at the 1-loop level where the lightest\nneutral Higgs boson may even be massless, without being detected at LEP2. The VEV of the\nneutral Higgs singlet has been shown to be no smaller than 16 GeV for any parameter values of\nthe NMSSM with explicit CP violation. This value of the lower limit is found to increase up to\nabout 45 GeV as the ratio (tan \u03b2) of the VEVs of the two Higgs doublets decreases to smaller\nvalues (\u223c 2). The discovery limit of the Higgs boson search at LEP2 is found to cover about\none half of the kinematically allowed part of the whole parameter space of the NMSSM, and the\nportion is roughly stable against the CP phase.\nIn this article, we continue our analysis more exhaustively by including the contributions from\nthe loops involving the W boson, charged Higgs boson, and chargino, in addition to those from\nthe loops involving quarks and scalar quarks of the third generation. It is found that the inclusion\nof the W boson, charged Higgs boson, and chargino loops yields significant modifications to the\nresults on the neutral Higgs sector obtained without them, depending on the parameter values\nof the model. At the 1-loop level two CP phases arise from each scalar quark mass matrix\nfor the third generation. We assume that at the tree level the CP phase is equal to two CP\nones arising from the contribution of radiative corrections due to the third generation quark\nand scalar quarks. One CP phase appears from the 1-loop effective potential coming from the\nchargino sector. We assume that the CP phase arising from the chargino sector does not equal\nthe other ones at the 1-loop level. We investigate the size of the contribution of the W boson, the\ncharged Higgs boson, and the charginos to the neutral Higgs boson mass at the 1-loop level. We\nthen investigate the phenomenological consequences for the neutral Higgs sector of the NMSSM\nwith explicit CP violation at future e+ e\u2212 collisions.\n\nII.\n\nEFFECTIVE POTENTIAL\n\nThe additional Higgs singlet superfield in the NMSSM can avoid the so-called \u03bc-parameter\nproblem in the MSSM, where the dimensional \u03bc parameter of the MSSM is introduced by hand.\nIn the NMSSM, the corresponding quantity is generated dynamically. The additional Higgs\nsinglet superfiled, N , has a vanishing hypercharge and neutral. The neutrality of N enlarges\nthe spectrum of neutral particles of the NMSSM with an additional scalar Higgs boson, an\nadditional pseudoscalar Higgs boson, and an additional neutralino, while the structure of the\ncharged sector of the NMSSM is essentially the same as that of the MSSM.\nIgnoring all quark and lepton Yukawa couplings except for those of the third generation\nquarks, the superpotential involving the superfields H1T = (H10 ,H1\u2212 ), H2T = (H2+ ,H20 ), and N in\nthe NMSSM with discrete Z3 symmetry is given by\nk\nW = hb H1T \u01ebQbcR \u2212 ht H2T \u01ebQtcR + \u03bbH1T \u01ebH2 N \u2212 N 3 ,\n3\n3\n\n\fwhere ht and hb are Yukawa coupling constants of the quarks for the third generation, and the\nparameters \u03bb and k are dimensionless coupling constants. The 2 \u00d7 2 antisymmetric matrix \u01eb is\ndefined as \u01eb12 = \u2212\u01eb21 = 1. The SU(2) doublet superfield QT = (tL ,bL ) contains the left-handed\nquark for the third generation, and the SU(2) singlet superfields tcR and bcR are the charge\nconjugates of the right-handed quarks for the third generation. At the tree level, a massless\npseudoscalar Higgs boson would appear if the global U(1) Peccei-Quinn symmetry would not be\nbroken explicitly by the cubic term in the Higgs singlet in the superpotential.\nIn the NMSSM one breaks the supersymmetry by introducing explicitly soft breaking terms\nto the Lagrangian. The relevant soft breaking terms for the above superpotential can be written\nas\nLsoft =\n\n\u2212 m2H1 |H1 |2 \u2212 m2H2 |H2 |2 \u2212 m2N |N |2 \u2212 m2Q |Q\u0303|2 \u2212 m2T |t\u0303cR |2 \u2212 m2B |b\u0303cR |2\n+\u0012\n(\u2212hb Ab H1T \u01ebQ\u0303b\u0303cR + ht At H2T \u01ebQ\u0303t\u0303cR +\n\u0013 H.c.)\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\nk\n3\na a\nT\nM2 \u03bb2 \u03bb2 + M1 \u03bb1 \u03bb1 + H.c. ,\n+ \u03bbA\u03bb H1 \u01ebH2 N + Ak N + H.c. +\n3\n2\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere m2H1 , m2H2 , m2N , m2Q , m2T , and m2B are the soft breaking masses; A\u03bb , Ak , At , and Ab are\nthe trilinear soft SUSY breaking parameters with mass dimension; \u03bba2 (a = 1, 2, 3) and \u03bb1 are\nthe gauginos of the SU(2) and U(1) gauge groups; and M2 and M1 are their mass parameters,\nrespectively. The full tree level Higgs potential V 0 can then be obtained by collecting the relevant\nF terms and D terms in the superpotential, to add to the Higgs part of the above soft breaking\nterms.\nThe condition for the electroweak symmetry breaking is obtained by minimizing the Higgs\npotential V = V 0 with respect to the VEVs of the three Higgs fields. We assume that the\nVEVs of three neutral Higgs fields H10 , H20 , and N are, respectively, v1 , v2 , and x, all being real\nand positive, so that there is no spontaneous CP violation in the Higgs sector in the NMSSM\n2\n[11-13]. The ratio of the two VEVs is denoted by tan \u03b2 = v2 /v1 , giving\npthe Z boson mass as mZ\n= (g12 + g22 )v 2 /2, and the W boson mass as m2W = g22 v 2 /2, with v = v12 + v22 = 175 GeV. The\nsoft SUSY breaking masses m2H1 , m2H2 , and m2N can be eliminated by imposing the minimum\nconditions on the Higgs potential.\nThe explicit CP violation in the Higgs sector of the NMSSM might be activated if there\nare complex phases in the Higgs potential. From the tree level Higgs potential of the NMSSM,\ncomplex phases might occur by assuming that \u03bb, A\u03bb , k, and Ak are complex numbers. Among\nthem, \u03bbA\u03bb and kAk can be adjusted to be real and positive by redefining the overall phases of\nthe superfields H1 , H2 , and N . Then, we are left essentially with one phase: It may be chosen\nto be the one in \u03bbk \u2217 = \u03bbkei\u03c60 , which allows for the explicit CP violation at the tree level. This\nphase appears in the expression for the mass of the charged Higgs boson [15]:\nm2C + = m2W \u2212 \u03bb2 v 2 + \u03bb(A\u03bb + kx cos \u03c60 )\n\n2x\n.\nsin 2\u03b2\n\n(2)\n\nNote that although the phase \u03c60 is present in the potential, it does not show up in the vacuum.\nThus, one need not impose a minimum condition on the Higgs potential with respect to it.\nConsequently, the tree level Higgs potential contains \u03c60 , tan \u03b2, \u03bb, A\u03bb , k, Ak , and x as free\nparameters.\nNow, at the 1-loop level, in the NMSSM with explicit CP violation, the radiative corrections\nto the tree level Higgs potential come primarily from the quark and scalar quark loops of the\nthird generation: Generally, the leading radiative corrections come from the top and scalar top\nquark loops. For large tan \u03b2, the contributions of the bottom and scalar bottom quark loops\n4\n\n\fcan be significantly large. Nevertheless, in order to carry out a comprehensive study on the\nphenomenology of the explicit CP violation at the 1-loop level in the NMSSM, one should also\ninclude the contributions of the W boson, the charged Higgs boson, and the charginos loops.\nLet us decompose radiative corrections to the 1-loop effective potential into three parts: a part\nfor the radiative corrections from the top and scalar top quark loops, another one for those from\nthe bottom and scalar bottom quark loops, and the third one for the radiative corrections from\nthe W boson, the charged Higgs boson, and the charginos. Thus, the radiative corrections to\nthe 1-loop effective Higgs potential is written as [16]\nV1 =Vt+Vb+V\u03c7 ,\n\n(3)\n\nwith\nVt =\nVb =\nV\u03c7 =\n\nM2t \u0303\n\n( 2\nX\n\n!\n\n\u0013)\n2\nM\n3\nt\n\u2212 2M4t log 2 \u2212\nM4t \u0303i log 2 i\n,\n\u039b\n\u039b\n2\ni=1\n!\n( 2\n\u0012\n\u0013)\nM2b \u0303\nX\nM2b\n3\n3\n3\n4\n4\ni\n\u2212 2Mb log 2 \u2212\nMb \u0303 log 2 \u2212\n,\ni\n32\u03c0 2\n\u039b\n2\n\u039b\n2\n\u001a i=1 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\u001b\n\u0012\nM2C +\nM2W\n3\n3\n1\n4\n4\n\u2212\n3MW log 2 \u2212\n+ MC + log\n32\u03c0 2\n\u039b\n2\n\u039b2\n2\n!)\n( 2\n2\nX\nM\u03c7\u0303\n3\n1\n,\nM4\u03c7\u0303i log 2 i \u2212\n\u2212\n2\n16\u03c0\n\u039b\n2\n3\n32\u03c0 2\n\n3\n\u2212\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n(4)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere M denote the mass matrices for the particles and superparticles with the field dependence,\nand \u039b is the renormalization scale in the modified minimal substraction (MS) scheme. The full\n1-loop level Higgs potential will be given by adding V 1 to the tree level Higgs potential.\nAmong the mass matrices, there is a 4 \u00d7 4 Hermitian mass matrix for the scalar quarks\nof the third generation, which may be broken up into four 2 \u00d7 2 block submatrices. After the\nelectroweak symmetry breaking, only two diagonal block submatrices become dependent on the\nneutral Higgs fields and thus have nonzero eigenvalues. By diagonalizing each diagonal block\nsubmatrix, one can obtain the 1-loop masses of the scalar top quarks and the scalar bottom\nquarks separately. From the complexity of the relevant parameters, a phase appears in the\nexpressions for the masses of the scalar top quarks and another one for the masses of the scalar\nbottom quarks. These two phases may also take part in the explicit CP violation at the 1-loop\nlevel. In general, the two phases are different. However, for simplicity, we assume that Ab = At ,\nwhile keeping them complex. Then, the two phases become equal.\nThe masses of the scalar top quarks m2t\u0303 and m2t\u0303 are obtained as\n1\n\nm2t + 12 (m2Q + m2T ) \u2213\n\nq\n\n1\n2\n4 (mQ\n\n2\n\n\u2212 m2T )2 + m2t (A2t + \u03bb2 x2 cot2 \u03b2 + 2At \u03bbx cot \u03b2 cos \u03c6) ,\n\n(5)\n\nand those of the scalar bottom quarks m2b\u0303 and m2b\u0303 as\n1\n\nm2b + 21 (m2Q + m2T ) \u2213\n\nq\n\n1\n2\n4 (mQ\n\n2\n\n\u2212 m2T )2 + m2b (A2t + \u03bb2 x2 tan2 \u03b2 + 2At \u03bbx tan \u03b2 cos \u03c6) ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the contribution from the D terms are not included. Thus the CP phase in the bottom\nscalar quark masses is equal to that of the top scalar ones: \u03c6 is the relative phase between At = Ab\nand \u03bb, allowing for the explicit CP violation in the Higgs sector through radiative corrections.\nThe phase \u03c6 would be absent as long as both the scalar top quarks and scalar bottom quarks\n5\n\n\fare degenerate in masses. In the scalar quark masses \u03c6 has no CP-violating effects on the Higgs\nsector, since it could be replaced by some modification of At anyhow. However, unless \u03c6 vanishes,\nexplicit CP violation occurs in the Higgs couplings through radiative corrections. We assume\nthat \u03c6 is equal to \u03c60 , in the mass of the charged Higgs boson, for simplicity. Note that the top\nquark mass is given by m2t = h2t v 2 sin2 \u03b2, and the bottom quark mass as m2b = h2b v 2 cos2 \u03b2.\nThe square masses of charginos are given by the eigenvalues of the square-mass matrix\n\u0013\n\u0012\ng2 (M2 H20\u2217 \u2212 \u03bb\u2217 H10 N \u2217 )\n|M2 |2 + g22 |H1 |2\n2\nM\u03c7\u0303 =\ng2 (M2\u2217 H20 \u2212 \u03bb\u2217 H10\u2217 N )\n|\u03bb|2 |N |2\nas\n\nm2\u03c7\u03031,\n\n2\n\n\u2243\n\n2\n1\n2 {M2\n\n+ \u03bb2 x2 + 2m2W } \u2213 [ 41 {M22 \u2212 \u03bb2 x2 }2 + m2W {M22 \u2212 \u03bb2 x2 } cos 2\u03b2\n\n+ 2m2W {(M2 sin \u03b2)2 + (\u03bbx cos \u03b2)2 \u2212 M2 \u03bbx sin 2\u03b2 cos \u03c6c }]1/2 ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere we neglect the quartic term of g2 since its order is equal to that of the D terms in the\nscalar quark sector. Notice that there is a complex phase in the chargino masses, \u03c6c , arising\nfrom the relative phase between the SU(2) gaugino mass M2 and \u03bb. We assume that \u03c6c is not\nequal to \u03c6. The total Higgs potential at the 1-loop level is written as V = V 0 + V 1 . Here, V 1\ncontains \u03c6c , mQ , mT , At , and M2 as free parameters.\nThe Higgs sector of the NMSSM has ten real degrees of freedom coming from two Higgs\ndoublets and one Higgs singlet. After the electroweak symmetry breakdown takes place, three\nof them correspond to a neutral Goldstone boson and a pair of charged Goldstone bosons, and\nthe other seven correspond to five neutral Higgs bosons and a pair of charged Higgs bosons.\nTransforming to a unitary gauge, one may express two Higgs doublets and one Higgs singlet as\n\u0012\n\u0013\nv1 + S1 + i sin \u03b2A\nH1 =\n,\nsin \u03b2C +\u2217\n\u0013\n\u0012\ncos \u03b2C +\n(8)\n,\nH2 =\nv2 + S2 + i cos \u03b2A\nN =\n( x + X + iY ) ,\nwhere S1 , S2 , A, X, and Y are neutral fields and C + is the charged field. If CP symmetry is\nconserved in the Higgs potential, S1 , S2 , and X would become the CP even scalar Higgs fields,\nwhereas A and Y would become the CP odd pseudoscalar Higgs fields. The three orthogonal\ncombinations among A and C \u00b1 yield one neutral Goldstone boson and a pair of charged Goldstone bosons; they will eventually be absorbed into the longitudinal component of Z and W\ngauge bosons, respectively.\n\nIII.\n\nNEUTRAL HIGGS BOSON MASSES\n\nIn the NMSSM with explicit CP violation the neutral Higgs boson mass matrix is given as a\n5 \u00d7 5 matrix that is obtained by the second derivatives of the Higgs potential with respect to\nthe five neutral Higgs fields. On the basis of (S1 ,S2 ,A,X,Y ) the elements of the symmetric mass\nmatrix for the neutral Higgs boson can be expressed as\nMij = Mij0 + \u03b4Mijt + \u03b4Mijb + \u03b4Mij\u03c7 (i, j = 1 to 5) ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere we note that Mij0 comes from the tree level Higgs potential, \u03b4Mijt from the contribution\nof the top and scalar top quark loops, \u03b4Mijb from the contribution of the bottom and scalar\n6\n\n\fbottom quark loops, and \u03b4Mij\u03c7 from the loops of the W boson, the charged Higgs boson, and\nthe charginos. Thus, Mij0 is obtained from V 0 , \u03b4Mijt from V t , \u03b4Mijb from V b , and \u03b4Mij\u03c7 from V \u03c7 .\nThe complicated expressions for Mij0 , \u03b4Mijt , and \u03b4Mijb are given elsewhere [15]. We concentrate on \u03b4Mij\u03c7 . We calculate each elements of it.

Meanwhile none of the other\noccur from the Higgs potential since both M13\n23\nelements for the scalar-pseudoscalar mixing in Mij0 are zero. Assuming the nondegeneracy of the\nscalar quark masses, the radiative corrections due to the quark and scalar quark for the third\ngeneration yield the scalar-pseudoscalar mixing between two Higgs doublets. Note that at the\n1-loop level, on the contrary, every element of \u03b4Mij\u03c7 is nonzero; the magnitudes of these elements\nare proportion to sin \u03c6c .\nIt is impossible to obtain analytic expressions for the eigenvalues of Mij as functions of the\nvarious parameters. We carry out the job of obtaining the eigenvalues numerically. The masses\nof the neutral Higgs bosons are then sorted such that mhi 6 mhj for i < j, such that mh1 is the\nmass of the lightest neutral Higgs boson. For the numerical calculations, we set the ranges of the\nrelevant parameters in the Higgs potential. The renormalization scale in the effective potential\nis taken to be 500 GeV. We fix mt = 175 GeV for the top quark mass [17], mb = 4 GeV for\nthe bottom quark mass, mW = 80.4 GeV for the charged weak gauge boson mass, and mZ =\n91.1 GeV for the neutral weak gauge boson mass. The upper bounds on \u03bb and k are estimated\nas 0.87 and 0.63, respectively, by the renormalization group analysis of the NMSSM [18]. Thus,\nwe set their ranges as 0 < \u03bb 6 0.87 and 0 < k 6 0.63. The ranges for other parameters are set\nas follows: 2 6 tan \u03b2 6 40, 0 < A\u03bb , Ak , x, mQ , mT (= mB ) 6 1000 GeV, 0 < At = Ab 6 2000\nGeV, and 0 < M2 6 500 GeV. Note that there are additional parameters at the 1-loop level,\narising from V \u03c7 : the relative phase (\u03c6c ) between complex M2 and \u03bb, as well as \u03c6. We assume\nthat they may vary from 0 to \u03c0. We further assume that the lighter scalar quark masses of the\nthird generation are larger than the top quark mass.\nThen, we impose phenomenological constraints on the values of the parameters. From the\nnegative results at the LEP2 experiments on the neutral Higgs boson, research has already\nsuggested some constraints on the parameter space of the NMSSM with explicit CP violation\n\u221a\n[15]. At the center of mass energy of LEP2, s = 200 GeV, the dominant production processes\nfor the neutral Higgs boson are (i) the Higgsstrahlung process, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Z \u2217 \u2192 Zhi (i = 1 to 5)\nand (ii) the Higgs-pair production process, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Z \u2217 \u2192 hi hj (i, j = 1 to 5, i 6= j). The total\n9\n\n\f+ \u2212\ncross section for producing any one of the\nPneutralPHiggs bosons in e e collisions is then defined\nby the sum of the two processes: \u03c3t = i \u03c3i + ij \u03c3ij /2 for i 6= j. Taking the discovery limit\n\u221a\nof LEP2 as 0.1 pb for s = 200 GeV, we exclude the parameter values if they produce \u03c3t > 0.1\npb.\nWe introduce a useful expression in order to evaluate the effects of explicit CP violation on\nthe neutral Higgs boson masses as in the case of the MSSM with CP violation in the Higgs\npotential [19]. It is the dimensionless parameter given by\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u03c1 = 55 O11\nO21\nO31\nO41\nO51\n,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere Oij (i, j = 1 to 5) are the elements of the orthogonal transformation matrix that diagonalizes the neutral Higgs boson mass matrix. The range of \u03c1 is from\nP5 0 to2 1 since the elements of the\ntransformation matrix satisfy the orthogonality condition of j=1 Oj1 = 1. If \u03c1 = 0, there is no\nexplicit CP violation in the Higgs sector of the NMSSM. On the other hand, if \u03c1 = 1, CP symmetry is maximally violated through the mixing between the scalar and pseudoscalar Higgs bosons.\n2 = O2 = O2 = O2 = O2\nThe maximal CP violation that leads to \u03c1 = 1 takes place when O11\n51\n41\n31\n21\n= 1/5. The elements Oij determine the couplings of the physical neutral Higgs bosons to the\nother states in the NMSSM. Elsewhere, the chargino sector contributions, i.e., the contributions\nfrom the loops of the W boson, the charged Higgs boson, and the charginos, to the neutral Higgs\nboson masses as well as to the mixings among them have been analyzed within the context of\nthe MSSM with explicit CP violation [5].\nLet mh1 denote the full 1-loop mass of the lightest neutral Higgs boson, including the contributions from the loops of the W boson, the charged Higgs boson, and the charginos, as well as\nother loops, and m0h1 denote the corresponding mass including all the loop contributions except\nthe loops of the W boson, the charged Higgs boson, and the charginos. Therefore, m0h1 is not\nthe tree level mass but the 1-loop mass with the radiative corrections due to the top quark and\nscalar top quark loops as well as the bottom quark and scalar bottom quark loops. Only the\nchargino sector contributions are absent in it. Then, the mass difference between mh1 and m0h1 ,\ndefined as\nm\u03c7h1 = mh1 \u2212 m0h1 ,\n\nwould evidently express the amount of the contributions from Mij\u03c7 , and hence V \u03c7 , to mh1 .\nWe scan the parameter space of the NMSSM using the Monte Carlo method and select points\nthat are consistent with the above constraints. The selected points are physically allowed in the\nsense that at those points the Higgs boson masses are positive and \u03c3t is smaller than 0.1 pb.\nThose points consist of the allowed region in the parameter space of the NMSSM. We search in\nthe allowed region for several points where m\u03c7h1 is large and/or \u03c1 is large, i.e., where the effect\nof the chargino sector contributions to the smallest mass of the neutral Higgs bosons and/or\nthe mixing among them is large. Figure 1 shows three such points with large m\u03c7h1 and/or \u03c1\nas illustration. In Fig. 1, we plot m0h1 , mh1 , |m\u03c7h1 |/mh1 , and \u03c1, against the CP phase \u03c6c . For\n|m\u03c7h1 |/mh1 and \u03c1, we express them in %. The parameter values for Fig. 1(a) are \u03c6 = \u03c0/2, tan \u03b2\n= 3, \u03bb = k = 0.5, A\u03bb = 800 GeV, Ak = At = 1000 GeV, x (= mT ) = 500 GeV, mQ = 900\nGeV, and M2 = 300 GeV, while the parameter values for Fig. 1(b) are \u03c6 = \u03c0/2, tan \u03b2 = 10, \u03bb\n= 0.03, A\u03bb = 60 GeV, k = 0.4, Ak = 200 GeV, x = 500 GeV, mQ = mT = At = 600 GeV, M2\n= 100 GeV, and for Fig. 1(c) are \u03c6 = \u03c0/2, tan \u03b2 = 10, \u03bb = 0.7, A\u03bb = 400 GeV, k = 0.5, Ak =\n20 GeV, x = 50 GeV, mQ = 500 GeV, mT = At = 1000 GeV, M2 = 100 GeV.\nFor the parameter values of Fig. 1(a), it is found that all of the neutral Higgs bosons mhi\n(i = 1 to 5) as well as \u03c3t are roughly stable against the variation of \u03c6c . They are numerically\n10\n\n\fobtained as mh1 = 25, mh2 = 127, mh3 = 786, mh4 = 819, mh5 = 902, mC + = 815 GeV, and\n\u221a\n\u03c3t = 0.5 fb for s = 200 GeV. One can see in Fig. 1(a) that the curve for m0h1 = 42 GeV\nis flat. This is because m0h1 contains neither \u03c6c nor M2 . Note that the effective potential for\nthe contributions of the quark and scalar quark loop for the third generation is independent of\nboth \u03c6c and M2 . In Fig. 1(a), m\u03c7h1 is always negative for the whole range of \u03c6c and slightly\ndecreasing. Thus, mh1 (GeV) is roughly stable but decreases quite slightly as \u03c6c increases from\n0 to \u03c0. Hence, the slight decrease in |m\u03c7h1 |/mh1 for larger \u03c6c . It is observed that \u03c1 increases\nas \u03c6c goes from 0 to \u03c0. This behavior of \u03c1 arises from destructive interferences between the\nchargino sector contributions and the other ones.\nFigure 1(b) displays a relatively large mh1 . We have mh1 = 94, mh2 = 98, mh3 = 128,\nmh4 = 346, mh5 = 346, mC + = 124 GeV, and \u03c3t = 36 fb. For the parameter values of Fig.\n1(b), the neutral Higgs boson masses as well as \u03c3t are almost stable against \u03c6c , similar to Fig.\n1(a). One sees that m0h1 and mh1 are nearly equal, and large as compared to the case of Fig.\n1(a). Thus, m\u03c7h1 for the parameter values of Fig. 1(b) is very small. It is positive for smaller\n\u03c6c and negative for larger \u03c6c . There is a crossover at about \u03c6c \u2248 2\u03c0/3. On the other hand,\n\u03c1 shows interesting behavior. It varies quite abruptly; it drops from 100% at \u03c6c = 0 down to\nzero at about \u03c6c \u2248 0.35\u03c0, and then increases as large as 80%. However, it is difficult to analyze\nwhy \u03c1 varies so widely mainly because of the nature of the Higgs sector of the NMSSM. The\ncomplicated form of the 5 \u00d7 5 mass matrix of the neutral Higgs bosons prohibits us to trace\nanalytically down the behavior of \u03c1.\nFor the parameter values of Fig. 1(c), m\u03c7h1 is always positive but decreasing from 13 GeV to\n5 GeV as \u03c6c goes from 0 to \u03c0. Both m0h1 and mh1 in Fig. 1(c) are comparable in size to the case\nof Fig. 1(a). Approximately, we have mh1 = 38, mh2 = 52, mh3 = 124, mh4 = 392, mh5 = 403,\nmC + = 364 GeV, and \u03c3t = 10 fb in Fig. 1(c). For m0h1 , we have about 25 GeV. The behavior\nof \u03c1 for the parameter values of Fig. 1(c) is as varied as that of the case of Fig. 1(b). We note\nthat the three sets of parameter values used in Fig. 1 are consistent with the LEP2 data, as\nindicated by the size of the total cross sections for Higgs production: None of \u03c3t is larger than\n0.1 pb, the discovery limit of LEP2.\nNow, let us study the behavior of m\u03c7h1 in detail. It comes from the 1-loop effective potential\nV \u03c7 , which includes the effects of the chargino mass splitting and possesses the CP phase \u03c6c ,\nwhich in turn depends on the SU(2) gaugino mass M2 . It represents the contributions of the\nloops of the W boson, charged Higgs boson, and the charginos. Thus, the dependence of m\u03c7h1\non \u03c6c and M2 would give us a measure of the effect of explicit CP violation in the NMSSM.\nFigure 2 shows the dependence of m\u03c7h1 on them, plotted against the ratio of the two chargino\nmasses m\u03c7\u03032 /m\u03c7\u03031 . In Fig. 2 there are three sets of curves, and each set consists of three curves\ncorresponding to three different values of \u03c6c : \u03c6c = 0 (solid curve), \u03c0/2 (dashed curve), and \u03c0\n(dotted curve). The extent of each curve corresponds to the variation of M2 : We vary M2 from\n1 to 500 GeV. For the rest of relevant parameters, we set their values as: \u03c6 = \u03c0/2, tan \u03b2 = 3,\n\u03bb = k = 0.5, A\u03bb = 800 GeV, Ak = At = 1000 GeV, x (= mT ) = 500 GeV, and mQ = 900 GeV\nfor the set of curves of feature (A1); \u03c6 = \u03c0/2, tan \u03b2 = 10, \u03bb = 0.03, A\u03bb = 60 GeV, k = 0.4,\nAk = 200 GeV, x = 500 GeV, and mQ = mT = At = 600 GeV for the set of curves of feature\n(A2), and \u03c6 = \u03c0/2, tan \u03b2 = 10, \u03bb = 0.7, A\u03bb = 400 GeV, k = 0.5, Ak = 20 GeV, x = 50 GeV,\nmQ = 500 GeV, and mT = At = 1000 GeV for the set of curves of feature (A3). In short, the\nparameter values for the three sets of curves of features (A1), (A2), and (A3) are the same as\nFigs. 1(a), 1(b), and 1(c), respectively, except for \u03c6c and M2 .\nWhen both \u03c6c and M2 approach zero as the charginos becomes degenerate in mass, m\u03c7\u03032 /m\u03c7\u03031\napproaches 1. Still in this case, if \u03c6c = 0, CP violation in the Higgs sector is possible from\n11\n\n\fV 0 + V t + V b since \u03c6 is fixed as \u03c0/2. For the parameter values of feature (A1), m\u03c7h1 is shown\nto be relatively independent of the variation in \u03c6c , and found to increase as M2 increases.\nNevertheless, m\u03c7h1 is always negative from \u221224 to about \u221216 GeV for the whole range of M2 .\nThe ratio of the chargino masses decreases from about 15 to 2 as M2 increases from 1 to 500\nGeV for the parameter values of feature (A1). On the contrary, for the parameter values of both\nfeatures (A2) and (A3), the ratio of the chargino masses increases as M2 increases from 1 to 500\nGeV: For those of feature (A2), the ratio of the chargino masses increases from 1 to as large as\n30, and for those of feature (A3), from 1 to 15.\nThe variation in m\u03c7h1 for the parameter values of feature (A2) is rather small: \u00b12 GeV for\nthe whole ranges of 0 < M2 6 500 GeV and of 0 6 \u03c6c 6 \u03c0. In contrast, the variation in m\u03c7h1\nfor the parameter values of feature (A3) is very large: it can be as large as 16 GeV. Therefore,\nthe overall view of Fig. 2 implies that m\u03c7h1 is not negligible at all. Our analysis shows that for\nsome particular values of the relevant parameters m\u03c7h1 may have any value between \u221224 and 16\nGeV. Thus, it may play a quite crucial role in the analysis of the explicit CP violation scenario\nof the NMSSM.\n\nIV.\n\nNEUTRAL HIGGS PRODUCTION IN e+ e\u2212 COLLISIONS\n\nWe know that the unsuccessful result at LEP2 for the Higgs search does not exclude the possibility of the existence of a massless neutral Higgs boson in the NMSSM with explicit CP violation.\nIn this section we investigate the detectability of a neutral Higgs boson in e+ e\u2212 collisions with\n\u221a\nmuch higher center-of-mass energy, such as at the future e+ e\u2212 linear collider with s = 500\n(LC500) GeV and 1000 (LC1000) GeV. We consider the case in which the lightest neutral Higgs\nboson of the NMSSM is composed dominantly of the singlet field.\nLet us first derive an upper bound on the mass of the lightest neutral Higgs boson in\nthe NMSSM with explicit CP violation, where the Higgs singlet field contribute dominantly.\nThe square of the radiatively corrected upper bound on the lightest neutral Higgs boson mass,\nm2h1 , max is given as\nm2Z + (\u03bb2 v 2 \u2212 m2Z ) sin2 2\u03b2\n3m4 (\u03bbx cot \u03b2\u2206t\u03031 + At \u2206t\u03032 )2\ng(m2t\u03031 , m2t\u03032 )\n+ 2 t2\n8\u03c0 v\n(m2t\u0303 \u2212 m2t\u0303 )2\n2\n1\n!\nm2t\u0303 m2t\u0303\nm2t\u0303\n3m4t (\u03bbx cot \u03b2\u2206t\u03031 + At \u2206t\u03032 )\n3m4t\n2\n+ 2 2\n+ 2 2 log( 1 4 2 )\nlog\n4\u03c0 v\n8\u03c0 v\n(m2t\u0303 \u2212 m2t\u0303 )\nm2t\u0303\nmt\n2\n1\n1\n2\n4\n3m (\u03bbx tan \u03b2\u2206b\u03031 + At \u2206b\u03032 )\ng(m2b\u0303 , m2b\u0303 )\n+ 2 b2\n1\n2\n8\u03c0 v\n(m2 \u2212 m2 )2\nb\u03032\nb\u03031\n!\nm2b\u0303 m2b\u0303\nm2b\u0303\n3m4b (\u03bbx tan \u03b2\u2206b\u03031 + At \u2206b\u03032 )\n3m4b\n2\n+ 2 2\n+ 2 2 log( 1 4 2 )\nlog\n4\u03c0 v\n8\u03c0 v\n(m2 \u2212 m2 )\nm2\nmb\n\nb\u03032\nb\u03031\nb\u03031\n!\nm6W m2C +\nm4W (cos2 \u03b2\u2206\u03c7\u03031 + sin2 \u03b2\u2206\u03c7\u03032 )2\nm4W\n2\n2\n\u2212 2 2\ng(m\u03c7\u03031 , m\u03c7\u03032 ) + 2 2 log\n4\u03c0 v\n8\u03c0 v\n(m\u03c7\u03032 2 \u2212 m\u03c7\u03032 1 )2\nm4\u03c7\u03031 m\u03c7\u03034 2\nm4 log(m\u03c7\u03032 2 /m2\u03c7\u03031 )\n\u2212 2W 2\n{cos4 \u03b2\u2206\u03c7\u03031 + sin4 \u03b2\u2206\u03c7\u03032 + sin2 2\u03b2(\u2206\u03c7\u03031 + \u2206\u03c7\u03032 )} ,\n2\u03c0 v (m2\u03c7\u03032 \u2212 m2\u03c7\u03031 )\n\nwith\n\u2206t\u03031\n\n= At cos \u03c6 + \u03bbx cot \u03b2 ,\n12\n\n(14)\n\n\f\u2206t\u03032\n\u2206b\u03031\n\n= At + \u03bbx cot \u03b2 cos \u03c6 ,\n= At cos \u03c6 + \u03bbx tan \u03b2 ,\n\n\u2206b\u03032\n\n= At + \u03bbx tan \u03b2 cos \u03c6 .\n\n(15)\n\nNote that \u2206\u03c7\u03031 and \u2206\u03c7\u03032 already appear in the expression of \u03b4Mij\u03c7 .\nIn the limit of cos \u03c6 = cos \u03c6c = 1, the above upper bound on the lightest neutral Higgs\nboson mass reduces to the one obtained with CP conservation in the neutral Higgs sector. The\nfirst two terms appearing in the expression for m2h1 ,max are obtained from the tree level Higgs\npotential. They do not have any CP phase. The maximum value of \u03bb determines the tree level\nupper bound on the lightest neutral Higgs boson mass. The remaining terms in m2h1 ,max come\nfrom radiative corrections arising from the quark and scalar quark loops for the third generation,\nas well as the loops of W boson, the charged Higgs boson, and the charginos.\nIn terms of mh1 ,max and mh1 , it is useful to express the upper bound of the other neutral\nHiggs boson masses as [20]\nm2h2\n\n6 m2h2 ,\n\nm2h3\n\n6 m2h3 ,\n\nm2h4\n\n6 m2h4 ,\n\nm2h5\n\n6 m2h5 ,\n\nmax\n\n=\n\nmax\n\n=\n\nmax\n\n=\n\nmax\n\n=\n\nm2h1 ,\nm2h1 ,\nm2h1 ,\nm2h1 ,\n\nmax\n\n\u2212 R12 m2h1\n\n,\n1 \u2212 R12\nP2\n2\n2\nmax \u2212 ( i=1 Ri )mh1\n,\nP\n1 \u2212 ( 2i=1 Ri2 )\nP3\n2\n2\nmax \u2212 ( i=1 Ri )mh1\n,\nP3\n1 \u2212 ( i=1 Ri2 )\nP4\n2\n2\nmax \u2212 ( i=1 Ri )mh1\n,\nP4\n1 \u2212 ( i=1 Ri2 )\n\n(16)\n\nP\nwhere Ri are defined as Ri = (Oi1 cos \u03b2 + Oi2 sin \u03b2) and satisfy the sum rule of 5i=1 Ri2 = 1.\nIt is known that if the center of mass energy of the colliding electrons and positrons is larger\nthan ET = mZ + mhi (i = 1 to 5), the Higgsstrahlung process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Zhi (i = 1 to 5) is viable\nfor the Higgs production. The cross section \u03c3i (i = 1 to 5) for hi production only through the\nHiggsstrahlung process is known to be related to that for the Higgs production in the standard\nmodel, \u03c3SM , by\n\u03c3j (mhj ) = \u03c3SM (mhj )Rj2 for j = 1 to 4\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n4\nX\nRj2 \uf8f8 .\n\u03c35 (mh5 ) = \u03c3SM (mh5 ) \uf8ed1 \u2212\n\n(17)\n\nj=1\n\nOne can derive the parameter independent lower bound of \u03c3i from the fact that \u03c3i (mhi ,max ) 6\n\u03c3i (mhi ).\nIn order to be systematic we assume that any of the five neutral Higgs bosons may be\nproduced via the Higgsstrahlung process if kinematically allowed. For each of them, we calculate\nthe cross section for their productions. Let us denotethe five cross sections as \u03c3i (i = 1 to 5);\ntheir dependence on the relevant parameters may collectively be expressed as\n\u03c31 = \u03c31 (R1 , R2 , R3 , R4 , mh1 ) ,\n\u03c3k = \u03c3k (R1 , R2 , R3 , R4 , mhj ,max ) (k = 2 to 5) .\n\n(18)\n\nBy varying Rj (j = 1 to 4) and mh1 , one can obtain the maximum values for each cross sections,\nwhich would provide us a criterion on whether it is possible to detect any of them at the future\ne+ e\u2212 colliders.\n13\n\n\fFor given Rj (j = 1 to 4) and mh1 , we may choose the largest one among the five cross\nsections: Let it be defined as\n\u03c30 = max{\u03c31 , \u03c32 , \u03c33 , \u03c34 , \u03c35 } .\n\n(19)\n\nNow, we take the minimum of \u03c30 by varying Rj (j = 1 to 4) and mh1 . This would tell us\nwhether at least one of the five neutral Higgs bosons might be detected. Thus, we search \u03c30 for\n0 6 Rj (j = 1 to 4) 6 1 and for 0 < mh1 6 mh1 , max , and set up its minimum value in order\nto examine the possibility of detecting at future e+ e\u2212 colliders at least one of the five neutral\nHiggs bosons of the NMSSM, at 1-loop level with explicit CP violation.\n\u221a\nIn Fig. 3(a) we plot \u03c30 , as a function of R12 for s = 500 (LC500) and 1000 (LC1000) GeV.\nFor comparison, we also calculate the corresponding quantity for the case where the CP violation\nis absent. The solid curve is the result for the case of explicit CP violation, while the dashed\ncurve is the result with no CP violation. From Fig. 3(a), one sees that for the case of explicit\n\u221a\n\u221a\nCP violation scenario, \u03c30 can be as small as about 10 fb for s = 500 GeV, and 2.5 fb for s\n= 1000 GeV. On the other hand, for the case with no CP violation, the smallest value of \u03c30 is\n\u221a\n\u221a\nabout 16 for s = 500 GeV and 3.0 fb for s = 1000 GeV. By assuming an efficiency of 50%,\nthe integrated luminosity at LC500 for 50 events would be required to be about 10 fb\u22121 in order\nto detect at least one of the five neutral Higgs bosons of the NMSSM at future e+ e\u2212 colliders if\nthe CP symmetry is broken explicitly in the model. If there is no explicit CP violation in the\nNMSSM, the corresponding integrated luminosity needs to be 6.25 fb\u22121 .\nIn the literature, the worst case has been considered [21] when there is no explicit CP\nviolation in the NMSSM: It is the case in which all the three neutral scalar Higgs bosons are\ndegenerate in mass and R12 = R22 = R32 = 1/3. For our study, with explicit CP violation, the\nworst case would be Ri2 = 1/5 (i = 1 to 5). The five neutral Higgs bosons in our study may not\nbe degenerate in mass. In Fig. 3(b), we plot \u03c3 for Ri2 = 1/5 (i = 1 to 5). It is found that all of\n\u03c3i (i = 2 to 5) except for \u03c31 increase as mh1 increases.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have investigated the neutral Higgs sector in the NMSSM with explicit CP violation at the\n1-loop level by using the effective potential method. For the radiatively corrected masses of the\nneutral Higgs bosons, we include not only the contributions of the quark and scalar quark for\nthe third generation, but also the contributions of W boson, the charged Higgs boson, and the\ncharginos. These additional contributions are found to be very crucial for the analysis of the\nneutral Higgs sector of the NMSSM, especially when the CP symmetry is broken explicitly.\nThere are several complex phases in the NMSSM with explicit CP violation: At the NMSSM,\nthree phases appear in the tree level Higgs potential and in the masses of the scalar top quarks\nand the scalar bottom quarks. We have assumed that these three phases are equal. At the\n1-loop level, besides these three phases, one additional CP phase arises from the 1-loop effective\npotential due to the contributions of the W boson, the charged Higgs boson, and the charginos.\nWe have found that the mass of the lightest neutral Higgs boson may either increase by 16\nGeV or decrease by about 24 GeV, due to the contributions of W boson, the charged Higgs boson,\nand the charginos. This amount of variation in mass is quite significant to the relatively light\nmh1 (25-40 GeV). Also the mixings among the neutral Higgs bosons are significantly affected\nboth by the CP phase and the contributions arising from the contributions of the W boson, the\ncharged Higgs boson, and the charginos.\n14\n\n\fThe production cross sections for the neutral Higgs bosons in the NMSSM with explicit CP\nviolation are calculated via the Higgsstrahlung processes, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Zhi (i = 1 to 5), when the\nlightest neutral Higgs boson is composed dominantly of the Higgs singlet field. The minimum of\nthe production cross section for at least one of the five neutral Higgs bosons in the NMSSM is\n\u221a\ncalculated to be about 10 and 2.5 fb for s = 500 and 1000 GeV, respectively. These values are\nabout one-third smaller than the corresponding numbers obtained by assuming CP conservation\nin the NMSSM Higgs sector.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by a grant from Kyungpook National University.
