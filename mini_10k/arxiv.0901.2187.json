Very-high-energy (VHE; >\n\u223c100 GeV) \u03b3-rays are expected from \u03b3-ray bursts (GRBs) in some scenarios. Exploring this photon energy regime\nis necessary for understanding the energetics and properties of GRBs.\nMethods. GRBs have been one of the prime targets for the H.E.S.S. experiment, which makes use of four Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov\nTelescopes (IACTs) to detect VHE \u03b3-rays. Dedicated observations of 32 GRB positions were made in the years 2003\u20132007 and a search for VHE\n\u03b3-ray counterparts of these GRBs was made. Depending on the visibility and observing conditions, the observations mostly start minutes to hours\nafter the burst and typically last two hours.\nResults. Results from observations of 22 GRB positions are presented and evidence of a VHE signal was found neither in observations of any\nindividual GRBs, nor from stacking data from subsets of GRBs with higher expected VHE flux according to a model-independent ranking scheme.\nUpper limits for the VHE \u03b3-ray flux from the GRB positions were derived. For those GRBs with measured redshifts, differential upper limits at\nthe energy threshold after correcting for absorption due to extra-galactic background light are also presented.\nKey words. gamma rays: bursts \u2013 gamma rays: observations\n\n1. Introduction\nGamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most energetic events in the \u03b3-ray\nregime. Depending on their duration (e.g. T 90 ), GRBs are categorized\ninto long GRBs (T 90 > 2 s) and short GRBs (T 90 < 2 s). First detected in late 1960s (Klebesadel et al., 1973), GRBs remained mysterious for three decades. Breakthroughs in understanding GRBs came only\nafter the discovery of longer-wavelength afterglows with the launch\nof BeppoSAX in 1997 (van Paradijs et al., 2000). Multi-wavelength\n(MWL) observations have proved to be crucial in our understanding\nSend\noffprint\nrequests\nto:\nP.H.\nTam,\ne-mail:\nphtam@lsw.uni-heidelberg.de\n\u22c6\nsupported by CAPES Foundation, Ministry of Education of Brazil\n\nof GRBs, and provide valuable information about their physical properties. These MWL afterglow observations are generally explained by\nsynchrotron emission from shocked electrons in the relativistic fireball\nmodel (Piran, 1999; Zhang & M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros, 2004). A plateau phase is revealed in many of the Swift/XRT light curves, the origin of which is\nstill not clear (Zhang et al., 2006). Observations of GRBs at energies\n>10 GeV may test some of the ideas that have been suggested to explain the X-ray observations (Fan et al., 2008).\nIn the framework of the relativistic fireball model, photons with energies up to \u223c10 TeV or higher are expected from the GRB afterglow\nphase (Zhang & M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros, 2004; Fan & Piran, 2008). Possible leptonic\nradiation mechanisms include forward-shocked electrons up-scattering\nself-emitted synchrotron photons (SSC processes; Dermer et al., 2000;\nZhang & M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros, 2001; Fan et al., 2008) or photons from other\n\n\f2\n\nF. Aharonian et al.: H.E.S.S. observations of \u03b3-ray bursts in 2003\u20132007\n\nshocked regions (Wang et al., 2001). Physical parameters, such as the\nambient density of the surrounding material (n), magnetic field equipartition fraction (\u01ebB ), and bulk Lorentz factor (\u0393bulk ) of the outflow, may\nbe constrained by observations at these energies (Wang et al., 2001;\nPe'er & Waxman, 2005).\nA possible additional contribution to VHE emission relates to the\nX-ray flare phenomenon. X-ray flares are found in more than 50% of\nthe Swift GRBs during the afterglow phase (Chincarini et al., 2007).\nThe energy fluence of some of them (e.g. GRB 050502B) is comparable to that of the prompt emission. Most of them are clustered\nat \u223c102 \u2013103 s after the GRB (see Figure 2 in Chincarini et al., 2007),\nwhile late X-ray flares (>104 s) are also observed; when these happen\nthey can cause an increase in the X-ray flux of an order of magnitude or more over the power-law temporal decay (Curran et al., 2008).\nThe cause of X-ray flares is still a subject of debate, but corresponding VHE \u03b3-ray flares from inverse-Compton (IC) processes are predicted (Wang et al., 2006; Galli & Piro, 2007; Fan et al., 2008). The\naccompanying external-Compton flare may be weak if the flare originated behind the external shock, e.g. from prolonged central engine\nactivity (Fan et al., 2008). However, in the external shock model, the\nexpected SSC flare is very strong at GeV energies and can be readily detected using a VHE instrument with an energy threshold of \u223c100\nGeV (Galli & Piro, 2008), such as the H.E.S.S. array, for a typical GRB\nat z\u223c1. Therefore, VHE \u03b3-ray data taken during an X-ray flare may help\nfor distinguishing the internal/external shock origin of the X-ray flares,\nand may be used as a diagnostic tool for the late central engine activity.\nWaxman & Bahcall (2000) and Murase et al. (2008) suggest that\nGRBs may be sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). In\nthis case, \u03c0-decays from proton-\u03b3 interaction may generate VHE emission. The VHE \u03b3-ray emission produced from such a hadronic component is generally expected to decay more slowly than the leptonic subMeV radiation (B\u00f6ttcher & Dermer, 1998). Dermer (2007) suggests a\ncombined leptonic/hadronic scenario to explain the rapidly-decaying\nphase and plateau phase seen in many of the Swift/XRT light curves.\nThis model can be tested with VHE observations taken minutes to hours\nafter the burst.\nMost searches for VHE \u03b3-rays from GRBs have obtained negative\nresults (Connaughton et al., 1997; Atkins et al., 2005). There may be\nindications of excess photon events from some observations, but these\nresults are not conclusive (Amenomori et al., 1996; Padilla et al., 1998;\nAtkins et al., 2000; Poirier et al., 2003). Currently, the most sensitive\ndetectors in the VHE \u03b3-ray regime are IACTs. Horan et al. (2007) presented upper limits from 7 GRBs observed with the Whipple Telescope\nduring the pre-Swift era. Upper limits for 9 GRBs with redshifts that\nwere either unknown or >3.5 were also reported by the MAGIC collaboration (Albert et al., 2007). In general, these limits do not violate\na power-law extrapolation of the keV spectra obtained with satellitebased instruments. However, most GRBs are now believed to originate\nat cosmological distances, therefore absorption of VHE \u03b3-rays by the\nEBL (Nikishov, 1962) must be considered when interpreting these limits.\nIn this paper, observations of 22 \u03b3-ray bursts made with H.E.S.S.\nduring the years 2003\u20132007 are reported. They represent the largest\nsample of GRB afterglow observations made by an IACT array and\nresult in the most stringent upper limits obtained in the VHE band.\nThe prompt phase of GRB 060602B was observed serendipitously with\nH.E.S.S. The results of observations before, during, and after this burst\nare presented in Aharonian et al. (2009).\n\n2. The H.E.S.S. experiment and GRB observation\nstrategy\n1\n\nThe H.E.S.S. array is a system of four 13m-diameter IACTs located at 1 800 m above sea level in the Khomas Highland of Namibia\n(23\u25e6 16\u2032 18\u2032\u2032 S, 16\u25e6 30\u2032 00\u2032\u2032 E). Each of the four telescopes is located at a\ncorner of a square with a side length of 120 m. This configuration was\noptimized for maximum sensitivity to \u223c100 GeV photons. The effective\n1\n\nhttp://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/HESS/HESS.html\n\ncollection area increases from \u223c103 m2 at 100 GeV to more than 105 m2\nat 1 TeV for observations at a zenith angle (Z.A.) of 20\u25e6 . The system\nhas a point source sensitivity above 100 GeV of \u223c1.4\u00d710\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121\n(3.5% of the flux from the Crab nebula) for a 5\u03c3 detection in a 2 h observation. Each H.E.S.S. camera consists of 960 photomultiplier tubes\n(PMTs), which in total provide a field of view (FoV) of \u223c5\u25e6 . This relatively large FoV allows for the simultaneous determination of the background events from off-source positions, so that no dedicated off run is\nneeded (Aharonian et al., 2006c). The slew rate of the array is \u223c100\u25e6\nper minute, enabling it to point to any sky position within \u223c2 minutes.\nThe H.E.S.S. array is currently the only IACT array in the Southern\nHemisphere used for an active GRB observing programme2 .\nThe trigger system of the H.E.S.S. array is described in Funk et al.\n(2004). The stereoscopic technique is used, i.e. a coincidence of at least\ntwo telescopes triggering within a window of (normally) 80 nanoseconds is required. This largely rejects background events caused by local\nmuons that trigger only a single telescope.\nThe observations reported here were obtained over the period\nMarch 2003 to October 2007. The observations of two GRBs in 2003\nwere made using two telescopes while the system was under construction. Before 2003 July, each of the two telescopes took data separately.\nStereo analysis was then performed on the data, which requires coincidence of events to be determined offline using GPS time stamps.\nAfter the installation of the central trigger system in 2003 July, the\nstereo multiplicity requirement was determined on-line. All observations since 2004 have made use of the completed four-telescope array\nand the stereo technique (Aharonian et al., 2006c).\nMost of the data were taken in 28 minute runs using wobble mode,\ni.e. the GRB position is placed at an offset, \u03b8offset , of \u00b10.\u25e6 5 or 0.\u25e6 7 (in R.A.\nand Decl.) relative to the centre of the camera FoV during observations.\nOnboard GRB triggers distributed by the Swift satellite, as well\nas triggers from INTEGRAL and HETE-II confirmed by ground-based\nanalysis, are followed by H.E.S.S. observations. Upon the reception\nof a GCN3 notice from one of these satellites (with appropriate indications4 that the source is a genuine GRB), the burst position is ob\u25e6\nserved if Z.A.<\n\u223c45 (to ensure a reasonably low-energy threshold) during H.E.S.S. dark time5 . An automated program is running on site to\nkeep the shift crew alerted of any new detected GRBs in real time.\nDepending on the observational constraints and the measured redshifts\nof the GRBs reported through GCN circulars6 , observations of the burst\npositions are started up to \u223c24 hours after the burst time, typically with\nan exposure time of \u2248120 minutes in wobble mode. The remarkably\nnearby, bright GRB 030329 was an exceptional case. It was not observed until 11.5 days after the burst because of poor weather, which\nprohibited observation any earlier.\n\n3. The GRB observations\nThirty-two GRBs were observed with H.E.S.S. during the period from\nMarch 2003 to October 2007. After applying a set of data-quality criteria that rejects observation runs with non-optimal weather conditions\nand hardware status, 22 GRB observations were selected for analysis\nand are described in this section.\n\n3.1. Properties of the GRBs\nFor each burst, the observational properties as obtained from the triggering satellite are shown in Table 1. These include trigger number, energy\nband, fluence in that energy band, and the duration of the burst (T 90 ).\nWhenever there were follow-up observations in the X-ray, optical, or\n2\n\nhttp://www.lsw.uni-heidelberg.de/projects/hess/HESS/grbs.phtml\nThe\nGamma\nray\nbursts\nCoordinates\nNetwork,\nhttp://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n4\nwhich include, e.g., burst position incompatible with known\nsources, and a high signal-to-noise ratio of the burst\n5\nH.E.S.S. observations are taken in darkness and when the moon is\nbelow the horizon.

If no observation at a given\nwavelength was reported, a dot (.) is shown. The reported redshifts (z)\nof 10 GRBs are also presented, of which 6 are lower than one. Two observed bursts, GRB 070209 and GRB 070724A, are short GRBs while\nthe rest are long GRBs. The population of short GRBs has a redshift\ndistribution (Berger et al., 2007) significantly less than that of the long\nGRBs (Jakobsson et al., 2006). Therefore, on average they are likely to\nsuffer from a lower level of EBL absorption.\n\n3.2. H.E.S.S. observations\nFor each burst, the start time, T start , of the H.E.S.S. observations after the\nburst is shown in Table 2. Since an observing strategy to start observing\nthe burst position up to \u223c24 hours after the burst time is applied, the\nmean T start is of the order of 10 hours. The (good-quality) exposure time\nof the observations using Ntel telescopes for each burst is included. The\nmean Z.A. of the observations is also presented.\n\n3.3. The ranking scheme\nX-ray flares were detected from three of the GRBs in the H.E.S.S.\nsample. They occurred at 273s after the burst for GRB 050726, 284s\nfor GRB 050801, and 2.6 \u00d7 105 s for GRB 070429A (Curran et al.,\n2008). Unfortunately, the flares occurred outside the time windows of\nthe H.E.S.S. observations.\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, there is no lack of models predicting\nVHE emission from GRBs. However, the evolution of the possible VHE\n\u03b3-ray emission with time is model-dependent. To give an empirical,\nmodel-independent estimate of the relative expected VHE flux of each\nGRB (which also depends on T start ), it is assumed that: (1) the relative\n\n\f4\n\nF. Aharonian et al.: H.E.S.S. observations of \u03b3-ray bursts in 2003\u20132007\n\nVHE signal scales as the energy released in the prompt emission, taken\nas a typical energy measure of a GRB. Hence FVHE \u221d F15\u2212150 keV where\nF15\u2212150 keV is the fluence in the Swift/BAT band. For bursts not triggered\nby BAT, the measured fluence is extrapolated into this energy band; (2)\nthe possible VHE signal fades as time goes on, as observed in longer\nwavelength (e.g. X-ray) data. In particular, the VHE flux follows the\naverage decay of the X-ray flux and therefore FVHE \u221d F15\u2212150 keV \u00d7 t\u22121.3\nwhere t denotes the time after the burst and 1.3 is the average X-ray\nafterglow late-time power-law decay index (Nousek et al., 2006). Since\nin most cases the exposure time of the observations is much shorter\nthan T start (the start time of the corresponding H.E.S.S. observations after the trigger), the expected flux at T start can be used as a measure of\nthe strength of the VHE signal, and therefore of the relative possibility\nof detecting a VHE signal from that GRB. By setting t to T start , we have\n\u22121.3\nFVHE \u221d F15\u2212150 keV \u00d7 T start\n\n(1)\n\nThe rank of each GRB according to equation 1 is shown in the last\ncolumn in Table 1. Note that redshift information (available for only a\nfew GRBs), and thus the corresponding EBL absorption, is not taken\ninto account in the ranking scheme.\n\nthan the corresponding error circles. Therefore, point-source analyses\nwere performed for all GRBs except GRB 030821, the error box of\nwhich is much bigger than the H.E.S.S. PSF (see Sect. 5.4 for its treatment).\n\n4.2. Energy threshold\nThe energy threshold, Eth , is conventionally defined as the peak in the\ndifferential \u03b3-ray rate versus energy curve of a fictitious source with\nphoton index \u0393 (Konopelko et al., 1999). This curve is a convolution\nof the effective area with the expected energy spectrum of the source\nas seen on Earth. Such energy thresholds, obtained by the standard-cut\nanalysis and the soft-cut analysis for each GRB observation, are shown\nin Table 2, assuming \u0393 = 2.6. The energy threshold depends on the Z.A.\nof the observations and the analysis used. The larger the Z.A., the higher\nis the energy threshold. Moreover, soft-cut analysis gives a lower value\nof Eth than that of standard-cut analysis. Note that \u03b3-ray photons with\nenergies below Eth can be detected by the telescopes.\n\n4.3. Optical efficiency of the instrument\n\n4. Data Analysis\nCalibration of data, event reconstruction and rejection of the cosmicray background (i.e. \u03b3-ray event selection criteria) were performed as\ndescribed in Aharonian et al. (2006c), which employs the techniques\ndescribed by Hillas (1996).\nGamma-like events were then taken from a circular region (onsource) of radius \u03b8cut centred at the burst position given in Table 1. The\nbackground was estimated using the reflected-region background model\nas described in Berge et al. (2007), in which the number of background\nevents in the on-source region (Noff ) is estimated from nregion off-source\nregions located at the same \u03b8offset as the on-source region during the\nsame observation. The number of \u03b3-like events is given by Non \u2212 \u03b1Noff\nwhere Non is the total number of events detected in the on-source region\nand \u03b1 = 1/nregion the normalization factor.\nIndependent analyses of various GRBs using different methods and\nbackground estimates (Berge et al., 2007) yielded consistent results.\n\n4.1. Analysis technique\nTwo sets of analysis cuts were applied to search for a VHE \u03b3-ray signal\nfrom observational data taken with three or four telescopes. These are\n'standard' cuts (Aharonian et al., 2006c) and 'soft' cuts7 (the latter have\nlower energy thresholds, as described in Aharonian et al., 2006a). For\nstandard (soft) cuts, \u03b8cut = 0.11\u25e6 (\u03b8cut = 0.14\u25e6 ). While standard cuts\nare optimized for a source with a power-law spectrum of photon index\n\u0393 = 2.6, soft cuts are optimized for a source with a steep spectrum (\u0393 =\n5.0), and have better sensitivity at lower energies. Since EBL absorption\nis less severe for lower energy photons, the soft-cut analysis is useful\nin searching for VHE \u03b3-rays from GRBs which are at cosmological\ndistances. For example, the photon indices of two blazars PKS 2005489 (Aharonian et al., 2005) and PG 1553+113 (Aharonian et al., 2008)\nwere measured to be \u0393 >\n\u223c 4.\nAn exception to this analysis scheme is GRB 030329. As the central\ntrigger system had yet to be installed when this observation was made,\na slightly different analysis technique was used. The description of the\nimage and analysis cuts used for the data from GRB 030329 can be\nfound in Aharonian et al. (2005). For GRB 030821, only the standardcut analysis (for two-telescope data) was performed (see Sect. 5.4).\nThe positional error circle of most GRBs, with the exceptions of\nGRB 030821, GRB 050209, and GRB 070209, is small compared to\nthe H.E.S.S. point spread function (PSF). The 68% \u03b3-ray containment\nradius, \u03b868 , of the H.E.S.S. PSF can be as small as \u223c3\u2032 , depending on\nthe Z.A. and \u03b8offset of the observations, and the analysis cuts applied. The\n68% containment radius, \u03b868 , of the observations of GRB 050209 and\nGRB 070209 is about 9\u2032 using standard-cut analysis8 , slightly larger\n7\n8\n\n'Soft' cuts were called 'spectrum' cuts in Aharonian et al. (2006a).\n\u03b868 is larger using soft-cut analysis\n\nThe data presented were also corrected for the long-term changes in the\noptical efficiency of the instrument. The optical efficiency has decreased\nover a period of a few years. This has changed the effective area and energy threshold of the instrument. Specifically, the energy threshold has\nincreased with time. Using images of local muons in the FoV, this effect\nin the calculation of flux upper limits is corrected (c.f. Aharonian et al.,\n2006c).\n\n5. Results\nNo evidence of a significant excess of VHE \u03b3-ray events from any of\nthe GRB positions given in Table 1 during the period covered by the\nH.E.S.S. observations was found. The number of on-source (Non ) and\noff-source events (Noff ), normalization factor (\u03b1), excess, and statistical significance9 of the excess in standard deviations (\u03c3) are given\nfor each of the 21 GRBs in Table 2. The results for GRB 030821 are\ngiven in Sect. 5.4. Figure 1 shows the distribution of the significance\nobtained from the soft-cut analysis of the observations of each of the\n21 GRBs. A Gaussian distribution with mean zero and standard deviation one, which is expected in the case of no detection, is shown for\ncomparison. The distribution of the statistical significance is consistent\nwith this Gaussian distribution. Thus no significant signal was found\nfrom any of the individual GRBs. A search for serendipitous source\ndiscoveries in the H.E.S.S. FoV during observations of the GRBs also\nresulted in no significant detection. The 99.9% confidence level (c.l.)\nflux upper limits (above Eth ) have been calculated using the method of\nFeldman & Cousins (1998) for both standard cuts (assuming \u0393 = 2.6)\nand soft cuts (assuming \u0393 = 5), and are included in Table 2. The limits\nare as observed on Earth, i.e. the EBL absorption factor was not taken\ninto account. The systematic error on a H.E.S.S. integral flux measurement is estimated to be \u223c20%, and it was not included in the calculation\nof the upper limits.\nFor those GRBs with reported redshifts, the effect of the EBL on\nthe H.E.S.S. limits can be estimated. Using the EBL model P0.45 described in Aharonian et al.

Stacking analysis\nAlthough no significant excess was found from any individual GRB, coadding the excess events from the observations of a number of GRBs\nmay reveal a signal that is too weak to be seen in the data from one GRB,\nprovided that the PSFs of the H.E.S.S. observations are bigger than the\nerror box of the GRB positions (which is the case, see Sect. 4.1). Firstly,\nstacking of all GRBs (except GRB 030821, which has a high positional\nuncertainty) in the sample was performed. This yielded a total of \u2212157\nexcess events and a statistical significance of \u22121.98 using the soft-cut\nanalysis. Use of standard cuts produced a similar result (see Table 4).\n\nTable 3.

Soft-cut analysis was used for all GRBs (except GRB 030329) since this analysis has a lower energy threshold and\na better acceptance of \u03b3-rays and cosmic rays and therefore increases\nthe statistics. The \u03b3-like excess events were binned in 10-minute time\nintervals for each GRB data set and were compared to the assumption\nof no excess throughout the observed period. The \u03c72 /d.o.f. value and the\ncorresponding probability are shown in Table 2 for each GRB. Within\nthe whole sample, the lowest probability that the hypothesis that the excess was zero throughout the observation period is correct is 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22123\n(for GRB 071003) and no significant deviation from zero within any\nof the GRB temporal data was found. Standard-cut analysis produced\nconsistent results.\n\n5.3. GRB 070621: Observations of a GRB with the fastest\nreaction and the longest exposure time\nGRB 070621 is the highest-ranked GRB in the sample (Sect. 3.3), i.e.\nit has the highest relative expected VHE flux at the start time of the\nobservations. The duration of the Swift burst was T 90 \u223c 33s, thus\nclearly classifying the burst as a long GRB. The fluence in the 15\u2013\n150 keV band was \u223c4.3\u00d710\u22126 erg cm\u22122 . The XRT light curve is represented by an initial rapidly-decaying phase and a shallow phase, with\nthe transition happening around t0 + 380s where t0 denotes the trigger\ntime (Sbarufatti et al., 2007). Despite extensive optical monitoring, no\nfading optical counterpart was found. The H.E.S.S. observations started\nat t0 + 420s and lasted for \u223c5 hours, largely coincident with the X-ray\nshallow phase. These observations were both the most prompt and the\nlongest among those presented. Figure 2 shows the 99.9% H.E.S.S. energy flux upper limits above 200 GeV (using soft-cut analysis), together\nwith the XRT results (Evans et al., 2007). As seen, the limits for this period are at levels comparable to the X-ray energy flux during the same\nperiod. Unfortunately the lack of redshift information for this burst prevents further interpretation of the limits.\n\nb\n\nb\n\nNumber\nof GRBs\n10\n6\n11\n21\n\n5.2. Temporal analysis\n\n5.4. GRB 030821: Observations of a GRB with a high\npositional uncertainty\nSome GRBs, such as GRB 030821, have a high uncertainty in position;\nwith a relatively large camera FoV (\u223c5\u25e6 ), the H.E.S.S. telescopes are\nable to cover the whole positional error box of such GRBs.\nObservations of GRB 030821 started 18 hours after the burst and\nlasted for a live-time of 55.5 minutes, with a mean Z.A. of 28\u25e6 . The\nobservations were taken when the array was under construction and\nonly two telescopes were operating, resulting in an energy threshold\nof 260 GeV. The GRB has a relatively high uncertainty in position\nas determined from IPN (the third Interplanetary Network) triangulation (Hurley et al., 2003), and its error box is bigger than the PSF of\nH.E.S.S. However, because of the relatively large FoV of the camera,\nthe whole error box, and thus the possible GRB position, is within the\nH.E.S.S. FoV. The sky excess map overlaid with the error box is shown\n\n\fF.

The 99.9% confidence level energy flux upper limits (in\nred) at energies >200 GeV derived from H.E.S.S. observations\nat the position of GRB 070621. The ends of the horizontal lines\nindicate the start and end times of the observations from which\nthe upper limits were derived. The XRT energy flux in the 0.3\u201310\nkeV band is shown in black for comparison (Evans et al., 2007).\n\nThe upper limits presented in this paper are among the most stringent\never derived from VHE \u03b3-ray observations of GRBs during the afterglow period. In fact, the 99.9% confidence level limits (in energy\nflux) are at levels comparable to the X-ray energy flux as observed\nby Swift/XRT during the same period (see, e.g. Fig. 2). Unless most\nof the GRBs are located at high redshifts and thus their VHE flux is\nseverely absorbed by the EBL (this possibility is discussed below), one\nexpects detection of the predicted VHE component with energy flux\nlevels comparable to those in X-rays in some scenarios (Dermer et al.,\n2000; Wang et al., 2001; Zhang & M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros, 2001; Pe'er & Waxman,\n2005; Fan et al., 2008).\nOn the other hand, the unknown redshifts of many of the GRBs\nin the sample (including GRB 070621, the highest-ranking, which is\ndiscussed in Sect. 3.3) complicate the physical interpretation of the data,\nbecause EBL absorption at VHE energies is severe for a GRB with z >\n1. The mean and median redshift of the 10 GRBs with reported redshifts\nis 1.3 and 0.7, respectively. If the 12 GRBs without redshift have the\nsame redshift distribution, one would expect \u223c40% of them (\u223c5 GRBs)\nto have z < 0.5. In this case, the EBL absorption may not preclude the\ndetection of the predicted VHE \u03b3-rays for the GRB sample presented\nhere11 .\nThere is no reported X-ray flare during the H.E.S.S. observational\ntime windows, therefore no conclusion on whether or not X-ray flares\nare accompanied by VHE flares, as well as the origin of X-ray flares,\ncan be drawn. If UHECRs are generated in nearby GRB sources, as\nsuggested by some authors, a detectable VHE flux is expected from\nnearby GRBs. Therefore, although the unknown redshifts of a significant fraction of GRBs in our sample (12 out of 22) and the uncertainty\nin the modeled VHE temporal evolution are surely in play, the results\npresented here do not indicate (but also not exclude) that GRBs are\ndominant sources of UHECRs.\n\n7. Outlook\n\nFig. 3. The \u03b3-like excess events in the region of the GRB 030821.\nThe error box shows the position of the burst localized by IPN\ntriangulation (Hurley et al., 2003). The colour (grey) scale is set\nsuch that the blue/red (black/grey) transition occurs at the \u223c1.5\u03c3\nsignificance level. The sky map was derived using two observations pointing at two different positions (marked by crosses),\nresulting in a non-uniform distribution of events in the map.\n\nin Fig. 3. As can be seen, there is no significant excess at any position\nwithin the error box. The sky region with the largest number of peak\nexcess events is located in the south-eastern part of the error box. Using\na point-source analysis centred at this peak, a flux upper limit (above\n260 GeV) of \u223c1.7\u00d710\u221211 cm\u22122 s\u22121 was derived. Since an upper limit\nderived for any location in the error box with fewer excess events is\nlower than this value10 , it may be regarded as a conservative upper limit\nof the VHE flux associated with GRB 030821 during the period of the\nH.E.S.S. observations.\n10\n\nA larger excess implies a higher value of the upper limit, since the\nintegrated exposure, that depends on Z.A. and \u03b8offset of the observations,\nis largely the same over the whole error box.\n\nThe data from our sample of 22 GRBs do not provide any evidence\nfor a strong VHE \u03b3-ray component from GRBs during the afterglow\nphase. EBL absorption can explain the lack of detection in our sample.\nHowever, this does not exclude a population of GRBs that exhibit a\nstrong VHE component. While the EGRET experiment did not detect\nMeV\u2013GeV photons from most BATSE GRBs in its FoV, some strong\nbursts (e.g. GRB 940217) have proved to emit delayed emission, \u223c1.5\nhours after the burst, at energies as high as \u223c20 GeV (Hurley et al.,\n1994). With Fermi's observations of GRBs having started in mid-2008,\nit is likely that our knowledge of the high-energy emission of GRBs will\nbe improved in the near future.\nThe future prospects for detection at VHE energies rely on the likelihood of observing a GRB with low redshift (e.g. z < 0.5) early enough.\nIn the cases where there is no detection, sensitive and early upper limits\non the intrinsic VHE luminosity of these nearby GRBs will still improve our understanding of the radiation mechanisms of GRBs. The existence of a distinct population of low-luminosity (LL) GRBs was suggested based on the high detection rate of low-redshift LL GRBs such\nas GRB 980425 and GRB 060218 (e.g. Soderberg et al., 2004). Due\nto their proximity, they are good targets for VHE observations. Since\nthey are sub-energetic compared to other GRBs, they may be accompanied by a lower VHE luminosity. On the other hand, if most radiation\nare emitted at high energies, the detection probability would be much\nhigher.\nFranceschini et al. (2008) claimed a very small \u03b3-ray opacity due\nto EBL absorption. The optical depth is about a factor of three less than\nthe one we used, depending on the energies (Aharonian et al., 2006b).\nTherefore, on-going GRB observations with H.E.S.S., as well as other\nground-based VHE detectors, are crucial to test this model.\n11\n\nThe optical depth of EBL absorption for a \u223c100 GeV photon is \u223c3\nat z = 1, according to the P0.45 model demonstrated in Aharonian et al.\n(2006b).\n\n\f8\n\nF. Aharonian et al.: H.E.S.S. observations of \u03b3-ray bursts in 2003\u20132007\n\n8. Conclusions\nDuring 5 years of operation (2003\u20132007), 32 GRBs were observed during the afterglow phase using the H.E.S.S. experiment. Those 22 GRBs\nwith high-quality data were analysed and the results presented in this\npaper. Depending on the visibility and observing conditions, the start\ntime of the observations varied from minutes to hours after the burst.\nThere is no evidence of VHE emission from any individual GRB\nduring the period covered by the H.E.S.S. observations, nor from stacking analysis using the whole sample and a priori selected sub-sets of\nGRBs. Fine-binned temporal data revealed no short-term variability\nfrom any observation and no indication of VHE signal from any of these\ntime bins was found. Upper limits of VHE \u03b3-ray flux during the observations from the GRBs were derived. These 99.9% confidence level\nenergy flux upper limits are at levels comparable to the contemporary\nX-ray energy flux. For those GRBs with reported redshifts, differential\nupper limits at the energy threshold after correcting for EBL absorption\nare presented.\nH.E.S.S. phase II will have an energy threshold of about 30 GeV.\nWith much less absorption by the EBL at such low energies, it is hoped\nthat the H.E.S.S. experiment will enable the detection of VHE \u03b3-ray\ncounterparts of GRBs.\nAcknowledgements.
