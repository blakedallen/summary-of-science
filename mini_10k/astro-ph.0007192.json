In the process of accreting gas\nthrough an accretion disk, each star returns a fraction of the inspiralling material\nto the interstellar medium at speeds comparable to the escape velocity from the\nstellar surface. These powerful winds, observable as jets of ionized gas, sweep\nthe ambient material into opposed streams known as bipolar molecular outflows.\nBecause of their intensity, protostellar winds pose severe challenges to those who\nwish to model star forming regions. On a small scale, the wind from a forming\nstar is capable of stripping gas from its parent molecular core even as that core\nfeeds material to the star. On a larger scale, the outflow driven by a star's\nwind can punch through a massive molecular clump that is forming a stellar\ncluster. There is now plentiful observational evidence that these interactions\nare common, even ubiquitous, within star-forming clouds. Moreover, there is\nevidence to support the argument (Norman & Silk 1980) that the feedback from\nprotostellar winds is the primary driver of turbulence within molecular clouds,\nand may be responsible for establishing Larson's (1981) line width-size relation\nin these clouds (McKee 1989).\n1\n\n\f2\n\nMatzner\n\nBecause these phenomena have profound consequences for the formation of\nstars and star clusters and for the evolution of molecular clouds, it is important\nto quantify the ways in which protostellar winds impact their molecular environment. In the past, models of feedback in star formation have either ignored\nthe effects of low-mass stars (e.g., Elmegreen 1983) or considered only spherically symmetric protostellar winds (e.g., Nakano, Hasegawa, & Norman 1995),\ndespite the fact that these winds are clearly jet-like. More sophisticated models\nof protostellar outflows (such as those of Shu et al. 1991; Masson & Chernin\n1993; Li & Shu 1996) have not been applied to the basic questions of feedback.\nPartly, this has been caused by a lack of consensus (see Richer et al. 2000) as to\nwhich of the several classes of models for outflows best describes their dynamics.\nWe shall argue that there is a single model for protostellar outflows that\nis both motivated by theories of protostellar winds and validated by its ability\nto explain some of the common, otherwise mysterious features of protostellar\noutflows. Although this model cannot explain all the details of these flows,\nit provides a stable platform from which to launch an exploration wind-cloud\ninteractions. We shall then use this model to address basic questions of star\nformation: the stellar initial mass function (IMF); the efficiency of star formation\nin clusters; and the dynamical evolution of star-forming gas during stellar cluster\nformation.\nThe work presented here has been conducted in collaboration with Chris\nMcKee and appears or is intended to appear in: Matzner (1999), Matzner &\nMcKee (1999a), Matzner & McKee (2000), and Matzner, Bertoldi, & McKee\n(2000).\n2.\n\nCommon Properties of Bipolar Molecular Outflows\n\nProtostellar molecular outflows typically share several common features, as discussed by Masson & Chernin (1993) and Lada & Fich (1996). These are: a\nroughly linear position-velocity (PV) diagram (a \"Hubble law\"); a lack of receding material in the approaching lobe, and vice versa; and a power law distribution\n\u0393 , where v\nof mass with velocity: dM/vobs \u221d vobs\nobs is the line-of-sight velocity\nrelative to the systemic velocity and \u0393 is typically about -1.8. Of these, the\npower law distribution of mass with velocity is the most difficult to explain, as\nit often holds quite well over a factor of five or ten in vobs (e.g., Lada & Fich\n1996).\nIn order to construct a theory for the feedback effects of protostellar winds\nit is necessary to develop a model for these outflows, which represent the interaction between winds and the ambient gas. To be tenable, such a model must\nconfront the common properties of outflows listed above. Moreover, it must\nalso be compatible with the ways in which protostellar winds are launched and\ncollimated, a topic we now address.\n3.\n\nStructure and Intensity of Protostellar Winds\n\nProtostellar winds are launched centrifugally from the inner regions of protostellar accretion disks (Blandford & Payne 1982). This is made possible by the\npresence of intense poloidal magnetic fields, which act as rigid tubes anchored in\n\n\f3\n\nFeedback from Protostellar Outflows in Star and Star Cluster Formation\nthe disk, along which gas is flung away. Once the wind has traveled sufficiently\nfar, the field weakens and gas begins to travel ballistically rather than being\nforced to corotate with the disk. Since it is still stuck to the same field line as\nwhen it was launched, and since that field line stretches back to the rotating\ndisk, the magnetic field is wound into a tight spiral. By the Biot-Savart law, the\ntightly-wound field implies that the wind encloses a current. Magnetic stresses\nassociated with current within the wind can generate forces that push the wind\ntoward or away from its axis. These forces are important for the collimation of\n< 1 AU) comparable to the launching region of the accrethe wind on scales ( \u223c\ntion disk, but on the larger scales of molecular outflows (\u223c 0.1 pc), the wind\nrelaxes into transverse pressure balance. Therefore, the wind's magnetic flux\nlines tend toward a force-free state in which there is no current within the wind:\nthe enclosed current lies entirely along the axis, rather than threading the wind\nitself. The field thus settles into the force-free state B\u03c6 = 2I(r)/(c\u031f), where\n\u031f = r sin \u03b8 is the cylindrical radius and the current I(r) is a very slowly varying\nfunction of r. (There must be currents, and hence forces, in the wind for I(r)\nto vary at all: these effect a continuing gradual collimation of the wind.)\nThis force-free distribution of toroidal magnetic field is sufficient to determine the ram pressure of the wind at large distances from its source. For, the\nmagnetic field lines must corotate with the disk in a steady state. This, along\nwith the fact that the wind will expand to fill the entire solid angle available\nto it, allows one to trace the field lines from their origin on the disk to their\ndestination on the sky (Ostriker 1997; Matzner 1999). Then, the conservation\nof mass and energy along each streamline determines the ram pressure of the\nwind in each direction. In the case of a wind whose density just above the disk\nvaries with disk radius \u031f0 as \u03c1w0 \u221d \u031f0\u2212q , and whose field lines expand significantly (\u031f \u226b \u031f0 ) according to the force-free distribution of the field, the wind\n2 \u221d C(r)\u031f (1\u2212q)/2 \u031f \u22122 (Ostriker 1997). Now, the disk\nram pressure varies as \u03c1w vw\n0\nradius \u031f0 is generally restricted within a very narrow range compared to the\nwind radius \u031f: for instance, in the model of Shu et al. (1995), \u031f0 takes only\na single value whereas \u031f extends from a few AU to \u223c 0.1 pc. For this reason,\nthe ram pressure of the wind is very close to \u03c1w vw \u221d \u031f\u22122 in practice (Matzner\n& McKee 1999a). This force distribution, which is characteristic of the x-wind\nmodel (Shu et al. 1995), is thus common among hydromagnetic winds.\nIn reality, variability and instabilities are likely to broaden the wind force\ninside some angle \u03b80 ; therefore, we consider the smoothed distribution\n\u03c1w vw =\n\n\u1e41w vw\n1\n1\n.\n2\n2\n4\u03c0r ln(2/\u03b80 ) (sin \u03b8) + (sin \u03b80 )2\n\n(1)\n\nIn the model for outflows presented below, observations imply \u03b80 \u2243 0.01.\nThe fact that hydromagnetic winds tend to \u03c1w vw \u221d (sin \u03b8)\u22122 is consistent with the theoretical expectation (Matzner & McKee 1999a) that the fast\n2 ), is roughly constant. This expectation\nAlfv\u00e9nic Mach number, B 2 /(4\u03c0\u03c1w vw\nfollows from the fact that this ratio is unity near the source, and varies logarithmically with distance along each streamline. The (sin \u03b8)\u22122 force distribution\nimplies that the cumulative wind momentum within some angle, pw (< \u03b8) \u2261\nR\u03b8\n2\u03c0r 2 \u03c1w vw sin \u03b8 \u2032 d\u03b8 \u2032 dt, varies as ln(\u03b8/\u03b80 ) for a broad range of angles, and this\nproperty will be useful for understanding outflows and their effects.\n\n\f4\n\nMatzner\n\ndM / dv\n\nobs\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n10 \u22121\n|vobs\u2212v0| (km s )\n\nFigure 1.\n\nMass-velocity relations for L1551 (triangles, Moriarty-Schieven\n& Snell 1988), NGC2071 (squares: Moriarty-Schieven, Hughes, & Snell 1989),\nand NGC2264G (diamonds: Lada & Fich 1996), fit with outflow model solid\nlines).

Velocities are relative to\nv0 , a center velocity, chosen to maximize the symmetry between each pair of\nlobes. Curves have been offset vertically for clarity.\n\nA protostar's wind lasts as long as it accretes material through its disk,\nwhich is essentially the free-fall time of the unstable core from which it formed,\ntypically \u223c 105 yr. If the wind's mass is a fraction fw of the star's mass,\nthen the wind momentum is fw vw m\u22c6 . We estimate that fw vw \u2243 40 km s\u22121 ,\nroughly consistent with the observational estimate of Richer et al. (2000); for a\nwind velocity vw \u2243 200 km s\u22121 , this implies fw \u2243 1/5, between the theoretical\npredictions of Shu et al. (1988) and Pelletier and Pudritz (1992). We expect\nfw vw to be approximately independent of stellar mass, because vw scales roughly\nwith the stellar escape velocity, which itself is regulated by deuterium burning\nduring accretion (Stahler 1988).\n4.\n\nBipolar Molecular Outflows from Hydromagnetic Protostellar Winds\n\nThe protostellar winds described above are essentially radial, both because they\nexpand to fill the available angle, and because the wind coasts after achieving\nforce balance. At wind speeds typical of low-mass protostars, the shocks that\nseparate the wind from the surrounding gas are radiative (Koo & McKee 1992),\n\n\fFeedback from Protostellar Outflows in Star and Star Cluster Formation\nso the swept-up shell conserves momentum in each direction. For a steady\nwind and an ambient medium whose density varies as \u03c1a \u221d Q(\u03b8)r \u22122 , Shu et al.\n(1991) showed that these ingredients reproduce the Hubble law for outflows.\nHowever, Matzner & McKee (1999a) demonstrated that neither a steady wind\nnor \u03c1a \u221d r \u22122 is necessary for this conclusion: as long as the ambient medium is\nrelatively featureless (e.g., a power law) on the scale of the outflow, the outflow\nmotion is self-similar even if the wind intensity varies. For radial motion this\nimplies the Hubble law, since v(\u03b8, t) \u221d r(\u03b8, t)/t. The collimated wind force\ndistribution \u03c1w vw \u221d (sin \u03b8)\u22122 leads to outflows that are highly elongated and\nhave bowshock-shaped tips of width r\u03b80 . This morphology is thus consistent\nwith a \"wide-angle\" driving wind. A collimated outflow with v \u221d r lacks blue\nmaterial in its red lobe and vice versa, consistent with observations.\nThat leaves only the power-law distribution of mass with velocity, dm/dvobs \u221d\n\u22121.8\n, to be explained. Masson & Chernin (1992) argued that the radial outflow\nvobs\nmodel of Shu et al. (1991) was inconsistent with this relation, but they only\n2 \u221d (cos \u03b8)\u2212\u03b2 for some \u03b2. Their results\nconsidered angular distributions \u03c1w vw\n2 \u221d (sin \u03b8)\u22122 . Indeed, Li\ndo not apply to hydromagnetic winds, for which \u03c1w vw\n& Shu (1996) demonstrated that the outflow driven by a steady x-wind into a\n\u22122\n.\nmagnetically-flattened core, with \u03c1a \u221d Q(\u03b8)r \u22122 , could produce dm/dvobs \u221d vobs\nI shall now show that this conclusion is much more general (see also Matzner &\nMcKee 1999a), and is essentially independent of the ambient medium.\nThe outflow shell expands at the rate dictated by momentum conservation;\n2 \u221d \u03b8 \u22122 for small \u03b8, and since one expects the ambient medium also to\nsince \u03c1w vw\nbe a power law of \u03b8, the rate of expansion obeys a power-law relation v(\u03b8) \u221d \u03b8 \u2212x\nquite generally. The power x can be computed, but it is not important for the\npresent argument. Now, hydromagnetic winds satisfy the cumulative momentum\ndistribution pw (< \u03b8) \u221d ln(\u03b8/\u03b80 ) for a wide range of angles, as described in \u00a73.\nBut since v \u221d \u03b8 \u2212x , momentum conservation [pshell (< \u03b8) = pw (< \u03b8)] implies a cumulative momentum distribution with outflow velocity pshell (> v) \u221d ln(v/vmax ),\nwhere vmax is the rate of expansion along the wind axis. This, in turn, implies\nthat dm/dv = d2 pshell (> v)/dv 2 \u221d v \u22122 ; and, since vobs \u221d v for an elongated\n\u22122\n, i.e., \u0393 = \u22122. Notice that essentially nothing about\noutflow, dm/dvobs \u221d vobs\nthe ambient medium entered into this argument; therefore, \u0393 \u2243 \u22122 is generic.\nFigure 1 demonstrates that models with this scaling can reproduce the massvelocity distributions of real outflows.\nThe commonly-observed features of molecular outflows are thus the natural\nproducts of momentum-conserving shells driven by hydromagnetic protostellar\nwinds: they are insensitive to the details of the wind's launching region, of variations in the wind's intensity, and of the ambient density distribution. Although\nthis model remains to be tested in detail, it matches observation well enough to\ndeserve attention as a mechanism for feedback.\n5.\n\nThe efficiency of star and star cluster formation and the IMF\n\nThe intensity of a protostellar wind along its axis ensures that within some angle,\ngas will be blown away. Because nearby gas is typically accreting onto the star\nitself or in the process of forming other stars, this process limits the efficiency\nwith which individual stars and multiple stellar systems can form (see Matzner\n\n5\n\n\f6\n\nMatzner\n\n& McKee 2000, for a more detailed discussion). Gas dispersal by protostellar\nwinds is more ubiquitous and less violent than disruption by massive stars.\nTo estimate the amount of gas (Mej ) lost per outflow, first note that outflows\npropagate by conserving momentum in each direction. To be ejected, material\nmust travel faster than the escape velocity vesc of the system. The momentum of\nthe escaping gas is at least Mej vesc ; therefore, Mej vesc < fw vw m\u22c6 . In reality, momentum is lost in those directions where the wind is too weak to eject anything,\nand wasted in those where the ejected gas travels faster than vesc . Since the\nwind momentum is distributed logarithmically with angle, the fraction available\nto eject material at around vesc is roughly ln(1/\u03b80 ); in fact, ln(2/\u03b80 ) turns out to\nbe a better estimate. Moreover, an outflow's momentum is reduced by a factor\ncg (typically of order unity) due to the action of gravity as it traverses the cloud.\nDefining the efficiency parameter X and the efficiency per star \u03b5,\nX \u2261 cg ln(2/\u03b80 )vesc /(fw vw ), \u03b5 \u2261 m\u22c6 /(m\u22c6 + Mej ),\n\n(2)\n\nMatzner & McKee (2000) find that for the formation of an individual star from\na collapsing molecular core,\n\u03b5\u22121 \u2243 (2X)\u22121 + [(2X)\u22122 + (1 + fw )2 ]1/2 ;\n\n(3)\n\nand for the formation of a star within a larger cluster-forming clump,\n\u03b5\u22121 \u2243 1 + (2X)\u22121 .\n\n(4)\n\nIn both cases, \u03b5 \u221d X for X \u226a 1 (strong winds) and \u03b5 \u2192 1 for X \u226b 1\n(weak winds). The core and clump cases differ for a number of reasons. In the\nformation of a single star, unlike in multiple star formation, we can safely assume\nthat all of the core mass is either accreted or ejected. Clumps have higher values\nof vesc (which raises X), but their density profiles are shallower (which lowers\nX through cg ); these effects roughly cancel. Finally, mass is ejected at angles\nmuch further from the wind axis in the core case; for this reason, the ejected\nwind mass is included in (3) but neglected in (4).\nFor the formation of an individual star, (3) assumes that the collapsing core\nis spherically symmetric. However, protostellar cores are likely to be partially\nsupported by magnetic fields, which will cause them to flatten along the magnetic\naxis. Since the protostellar wind is likely to share this axis, magnetic flattening\nsegregates material away from the wind axis, reducing the amount that will\nbe ejected and increasing the efficiency. Employing the models of flattened,\nmagnetized cores presented by Li & Shu (1996), Matzner & McKee (2000) find\nthat equation (3) remains valid if X is replaced by (1 + H0 )3/2 X, where 1 \u2264\n< 2 is the factor by which magnetic support increases the core's mean\n(1 + H0 ) \u223c\ndensity. In the limit of a completely disk-like core (H0 \u226b 1), only the wind mass\nwould be lost [\u03b5 \u2192 1/(1 + fw )]. Individual stars form at about 30% efficiency\nif cores are spherical (H0 = 0), or \u223c 75% if they are significantly flattened\n(H0 = 1), as shown in the left panel of figure 2.\nFor the formation of a star within a stellar cluster-forming clump, the\nanisotropy of the region is not likely to correlate with the wind axis. But,\n(4) assumes that each star forms at the center of a spherical distribution.

Above the dash-dot line, stars more massive than 20 M\u2299 are likely to form; our estimates are therefore only rough\nupper limits in this region. The analytical expression relies on assumptions\nthat break down outside of the upper and lower thin lines.\n\na cloud, Matzner & McKee (2000) find that (4) is an excellent approximation\nnevertheless, as shown in the right panel of figure 2. Equation (4) predicts\n< \u03b5 < 50% for the conditions typical of low-mass stellar clusterefficiencies 30% \u223c\n\u223c\nforming regions, like those in Orion B (Lada 1992): each star expels one to two\ntimes its own mass from the clump. It is difficult to compare \u03b5 with its observational analogue, the ratio of stellar to total mass, but the two quantities are\nsimilar in a few well-studied cluster-forming regions (Matzner & McKee 2000).\nUsing the efficiency of individual star formation, we can estimate the degree to which the stellar IMF differs from the mass function of pre-stellar cores\n(Nakano et al. 1995), a topic that has recently come under observational scrutiny\n(Motte, Andr\u00e9, & Neri 1998). This comparison, discussed in detail by Matzner\n& McKee (2000), involves a consideration of how much X, and thus \u03b5, differs\namong cores of different masses. We find that the variation of \u03b5 is quite subtle,\nand that the slope of the IMF is thus only slightly flatter than the slope of the\ncore mass function.\nIt should be noted that equations (3) and (4) predict efficiencies significantly\nhigher than those found by Nakano et al. (1995), and that this is a direct result\nof the collimation of protostellar winds. By this process (in contrast to the effect\nof a massive star), mass is lost continuously as stars form. The efficiencies found\nabove are consistent with the formation of bound clusters (Mathieu 1983), which\nraises the question of why so few actually do remain bound (Lada & Lada 1991).\nThis could be due to a violent event associated with massive star formation;\n\n\f8\n\nMatzner\n\nalternatively, clusters could be unbound by motions of their parent clumps, a\ntopic we address below.\n6.\n\nDynamical Evolution of Clumps During Cluster Formation\n\nEmbedded stellar clusters are found exclusively within the most massive clumps\ninside molecular clouds. Since these clumps are massive enough to be confined\nby their own self-gravity despite the weight of the molecular cloud above them\n(McKee 1999), we can gain insight into the production of a stellar cluster by\napproximating a clump as a distinct reservoir of gas, and examining its dynamical evolution while a stellar cluster forms within it. This is the subject of an\nongoing investigation (Matzner 1999; Matzner & McKee 1999b; Matzner et al.\n2000), and the results reported here should be considered preliminary.\nLike any self-gravitating gaseous system, a cluster-forming clump must satisfy the virial theorem for self-gravitating gas (here in Eulerian form; McKee &\nZweibel 1992):\n1 \u0308\n1 d\nI = 2(T \u2212 T 0 ) + W + M \u2212\n2\n2 dt\n\nZ\n\n(\u03c1vr 2 ) * dS,\n\n(5)\n\nS\n\n2 /2 is the trace of the clumps's moment of inertia tensor; W\nwhere I \u2243 Mcl Rcl\nand M are its gravitational and magnetic energies; the kinetic energy of its\ninternal motions is T ; T0 is an energy associated with its confining pressure;\nand the last term accounts for gas that may leave the system. Equation (5) has\nbeen used to identify equilibrium states of star-forming molecular clouds (McKee\n1989; Bertoldi & McKee 1996), but it can also be taken as a dynamical equation\nif not taken to equal zero. In order to accomplish this, each of the energetic\nterms must be approximated as a function of four dynamical variables: the\nclump's mass Mcl and the mass M\u22c6 of its embedded cluster, its radius Rcl , and\nits internal velocity dispersion vrms . To simplify matters, the results presented\nhere assume a spherical, magnetically supercritical (Mcl = 2M\u03a6 ) clump with a\n\u03c1 \u221d r \u22121 density profile and no rotation; any stars are assumed to move along\nwith the gas.\nTo complete our description of the system, it is necessary to specify the\nevolution of Mcl , M\u22c6 , and vrms . All three are affected by star formation and\nthe effects of protostellar outflows on the gas. For this, we use the theory of\nMcKee (1989): the local rate of gas conversion into stars (t\u22121\ng\u22c6 ) is identical to\nthe local ambipolar-diffusion rate (t\u22121\n),\nbecause\nthe\nformation\nof protostellar\nAD\ncores requires the assembly of magnetically supercritical condensations. Because\nof ionization by external FUV photons, star formation is inhibited within four\nvisual magnitudes of the surface; interior to that, it proceeds at about a twelfth\nof the local free-fall rate. As stars form, their mass is added to M\u22c6 and subtracted\nfrom Mcl ; also subtracted is the mass of gas that is ejected according to equation\n(4).\nFor a massive molecular clump, vrms is dominated by non-thermal turbulent motions. The turbulent energy decays at a characteristic rate that can be\n2 /(\u03b7t ), where t is the free-fall time\nparameterized by (dv 2 rms /dt)decay = \u2212vrms\nff\nff\nof the clump. Therefore, turbulence must be replenished every \u03b7 free-fall times;\n\n\f9\n\nFeedback from Protostellar Outflows in Star and Star Cluster Formation\n\n\u03b7=3\n\n1.5\n1\n\ncl\n\nR (pc)\n\n2\n\n0.5\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n\u03b7=1\n\n1.5\n1\n\ncl\n\nR (pc)\n\n2\n\n0.5\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n\u03b7=10\n\n1.5\n1\n\ncl\n\nR (pc)\n\n2\n\n0.5\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nt (Myr)\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nFigure 3.\nThe evolution of a 500 M\u2299 molecular clump as a stellar cluster\nforms within it. All simulations start from a state of equilibrium star formation; they differ in the rate of turbulent decay (\u03b7tff )\u22121 , and in whether star\nformation is taken to be continuous (solid lines) or individual (dashed lines).\n< \u03b7 < 10, where numerical experiments (e.g., Stone, Ostriker, &\nwe expect 1 \u223c\n< 1. Turbulent energy can derive from two sources. For\nGammie 1998) favor \u03b7 \u223c\none, it can be exchanged for other energies of the system, through work done\nduring compressions or expansions of the cloud; for this, we use the analytical\nresults of Zweibel & McKee (1995) and McKee & Zweibel (1995) to estimate\nthe energetics of turbulent, magnetized gas. This process does not, however,\nprevent the cloud from collapsing. Alternatively, turbulence may be stirred up\nby protostellar outflows. Since these conserve momentum, it is most convenient\nto consider the clump's turbulent momentum (Mcl vrms ) enhanced an amount\n\u03c6w pw by a wind of momentum pw ; here, \u03c6w \u223c 0.6 is the fraction of the wind\nmomentum that does not escape the clump (Matzner 1999).\nPutting these elements together, it is useful to consider two approximations:\none in which energy is added continuously according to the mean star formation\nrate within the clump, and another where stars form randomly at the current\nstar formation rate, are chosen individually from the IMF, and affect the cloud\ninstantaneously. These approaches differ for clumps of about five hundred solar\nmasses or less, in which only ten to twenty stars form per tff . In the continuous\napproximation it is possible to identify equilibria (Norman & Silk 1980; McKee\n\n\f10\n\nMatzner\n\n1989) in which turbulent decay is just offset by injection from outflows. These\nare stable, in the sense that a compressed cloud's turbulence is enhanced faster\nthan it decays. But they can also be overstable, as energy in an oscillation can\ngrow during compressive phases.\nPerturbations due to individual forming stars will stimulate oscillations of\nthe system, whose response depends critically on the rate of turbulent decay.\nFigure 3 shows the effect of changing \u03b7 for a clump of 500M\u2299 : when turbulence\ndecays slowly (\u03b7 = 10), a cluster-forming cloud will remain very close to its\nequilibrium state, whether or not star formation is taken to be continuous. For\nmoderate turbulent decay (\u03b7 = 3), individual star formation seeds overstable\noscillations about equilibrium: stars form in bursts. For fast turbulent decay\n(\u03b7 = 1), a continuous simulation can remain near its equilibrium, but one with\nindividual star formation cannot consistently replenish the lost turbulent energy\nevery dynamical time; the system collapses. Although the approximations used\nin these simulations (e.g., spherical symmetry and no rotation) affect these outcomes, it appears that the duration and constancy of star formation are sensitive\nto the rate of turbulent decay.\n\n7.\n\nConclusions\n\nObservations of star-forming regions and of individual accreting protostars have\nmade it increasingly clear that stars interact violently with their parent clouds as\nthey form. To model this phenomenon requires an understanding of protostellar\nwinds, and of the bipolar molecular outflows they drive into the surrounding\ngas. We have seen that the typically observed features of molecular outflows\ncan be explained as the natural product of magnetically-collimated winds and\nradiative shocks. This yields a model for outflows which can be used to estimate\nhow much mass is ejected, either from an individual collapsing core or from a\nmassive clump in the process of forming a stellar cluster. The estimates of star\nformation efficiency (30% \u2212 50%) presented in \u00a75 are much higher than those of\nNakano et al. (1995), because they account for the collimation of protostellar\nwinds.\nLastly, the feedback effects of protostellar outflows can be incorporated\ninto simple dynamical models for the process of stellar cluster formation within\nmassive molecular clumps. The investigations described in \u00a76 show that the\ndynamics of stellar cluster formation are sensitive to the rate at which turbulence\ndecays, and this will have observational consequences.\nIn the future, large-scale numerical simulations of star formation must include protostellar outflows, for without them such simulations are incomplete.\nAcknowledgments.
