Superfluidity [1, 2] and density imbalance\n[3, 4] in two component Fermi gases have been demonstrated experimentally. Together these offer the exciting perspective of achieving the Fulde-Ferrell-LarkinOvchinnikov (FFLO) phase [5, 6], an unconventional superfluid state in imbalanced Fermion systems. It has\nbeen under theoretical investigation since the 1960s but\nhas so far eluded unambiguous experimental detection.\nIn solid state systems the detection of the FFLO phase\nis unfavourable since density imbalances between spin up\nand down electrons need to be imposed via Zeeman splitting, requiring strong magnetic fields. This in turn destroys superconductivity via diamagnetic effects [7]. Ultracold atomic gases are favourable for its detection since\nit is possible to set the density imbalance of the system\nsimply by adjusting the number of spin up and down\nparticles which are loaded into the atomic trap [3, 4].\nTheory does predict the occurrence of the FFLO phase\nin three-dimensional (3D) ultracold Fermi gases though\nthe region of parameter space it occupies is thought to be\nrelatively small (for a review see [8]). On the other hand\nthe FFLO phase is expected to be stabilised in quasi onedimensional (1D) geometries which can be imposed using\noptical lattices [1, 9\u201314].\nIn a recent development one-dimensional imbalanced\nFermi gas systems have been created in experiment [15].\nThese recent experimental results indicate that the density distribution is of the form expected for the partiallypolarised state associated with the FFLO phase. However, a direct demonstration of the ordering in the FFLO\nphase remains to be shown. An important question which\nnow arises, is how best to detect this characteristic ordering of the FFLO phase. Previous proposals for the\ndetection of the FFLO phase include detecting characteristic peaks in the expansion image following release of\n\nthe trap [8], the probing of noise correlations in an expansion image [14], and the use of RF spectroscopy to\nexcite atoms out of the gas into other states [16]. In a recent letter [17] we showed how the FFLO phase in 1D at\nT = 0 can be detected via its collective mode signature.\nIn this paper we extend this discussion to non-zero temperature and discuss other aspects of collective modes in\nimbalanced Fermi gases. Collective modes have proved\nvery useful for probing the properties of ultracold balanced [2] and imbalanced [18\u201321] Fermi gases. Our work\nextends these discussions to one dimension and the presence of the FFLO state.\nThe paper is organised as follows. In Sec. II we present\nthe theoretical model of our study. In Sec. III we describe\nthe homogeneous system and present our results for the\nassociated collective mode spectrum. We describe the\nspeed of sound as a function of the polarisation of the\nFermi gas and highlight the collective mode signature of\nthe FFLO phase. We then discuss the effects of nonzero\ntemperature. In Sec. IV we turn our attention to the\ntrapped Fermi gas. We assess the accuracy of the single\nmode approximation for various low-frequency modes in\na trap. We then investigate the effect of the FFLO phase\non the collective mode spectrum of the trapped imbalanced Fermi gas. From this we deduce a signature of the\npresence of the FFLO phase in the collective mode spectrum. Finally we describe the response of the trapped\nFermi gas to a modulation of the coupling constant.\n\nII.\n\nTHEORETICAL MODEL\n\nWe study a model of a two-component Fermi gas in\none dimension with attractive contact interactions and\nunequal densities. For a homogeneous system, the exact\ngroundstates [9, 10, 22\u201324] and thermodynamics [25] are\nknown from the Bethe ansatz [26\u201328]. As has been discussed in detail by Liu et al. [29], Bogoliubov de Gennes\n(BdG) mean-field theory provides an accurate descrip-\n\n\f2\ntion of the exact phase diagram for the 1D system, at\nleast within the weak-coupling BCS regime. We have\nextended the mean-field theory to investigate the linear\nresponse and collective modes of both the trapped and\nuntrapped imbalanced Fermi gas.\nOur numerical calculations are based on the discretised\nBogoliubov de Gennes Hamiltonian which is given by\n\u0011\nX\u0010 \u2020\n\u0109i+1,\u03c3 \u0109i,\u03c3 + h.c.\n\u0124 = \u2212J\ni,\u03c3\n\n\u0011 X\nX\u0010\nWi,\u03c3 \u0109\u2020i,\u03c3 \u0109i,\u03c3 (1)\n+\n\u2206i \u0109\u2020i,\u2191 \u0109\u2020i,\u2193 + h.c. +\ni\n\ni,\u03c3\n\n(\u2020)\n\nwhere \u0109i,\u03c3 are fermionic operators for species \u03c3 =\u2191, \u2193 on\nint\n\u2212 \u03bc\u03c3 (with V ext the external\nsite i, Wi,\u03c3 \u2261 Viext + Vi,\u03c3\n\u2020\nint\npotential, Vi,\u03c3 = U h\u0109i,\u03c3\u0304 \u0109i,\u03c3\u0304 i, \u03bc\u03c3 the chemical potentials\nand \u03c3\u0304 is the spin opposite to spin \u03c3) and \u2206i \u2261 U h\u0109i,\u2193 \u0109i,\u2191 i\nis the local superfluid gap. J is the hopping parameter\nand U the on-site interaction strength (U < 0 is assumed\nthroughout). The angled brackets h. . .i denote the thermal and quantum expectation value at temperature T .\nThe corresponding Bogoliubov de Gennes equations are\nsolved self consistently to yield the mean field ground\nstate.\nThe results we present are at sufficiently low particle\ndensity to be representative of the continuum limit. In\nthe mapping to the continuum, we relate site i to position\n~2\nx via x = ia, the mass is m = 2Ja\n2 and the 1D interaction parameter is g1d = U a. The interaction strength \u03b3,\ndefined as the ratio of the interaction energy density to\nthe kinetic energy density, is given by\n\u03b3=\u2212\n\nmg1d\n~2 \u03c1\n\n(2)\n\n[29] where \u03c1 is the total density of particles. In the case of\na trapped system we take \u03b3 to be defined by the density\nat the centre of the trap. We restrict our study to values\nof \u03b3 up to about \u03b3 = 1.6 where mean-field theory gives\nqualitatively accurate results [29]. The Fermi wavevector\nfor spin \u03c3 is given by kF \u03c3 = \u03c0\u03c1\u03c3 where \u03c1\u03c3 is the density\nfor spin \u03c3. We define the polarisation p of the 1D Fermi\ngas as\nkF,\u2191 \u2212 kF,\u2193\np\u2261\n.\nkF,\u2191 + kF,\u2193\n\nin [17] and as we will argue in Sec. III C, this approximate theory correctly captures all qualitative features of\nthe collective modes that are important for our purposes.\n\nThe self consistent linear response within RPA is computed as follows. Let\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u00c2i (t) = \u03c1\u0302i,\u2191 (t), \u03ba\u0302\u2020i (t), \u03ba\u0302i (r), \u03c1\u0302i,\u2193 (t)\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c1\u0302i,\u03c3 = \u0109\u2020i,\u03c3 (t)\u0109i,\u03c3 (t), \u03ba\u0302\u2020i (t) = \u0109\u2020i,\u2191 (t)\u0109\u2020i,\u2193 (t) in the\nHeisenberg representation. Furthermore, let \u00c2i,\u03b1 (t) (\u03b1 \u2208\n{1..4}) refer to the four components of \u00c2i (t) and denote\nthe Fourier transforms of \u00c2i,\u03b1 (t) as \u00c2i,\u03b1 (\u03c9).

The self consistent response function \u03c7 is obtained within RPA by taking into account the change\nin\nE\nD\nthe Hamiltonian due to a change in the quantities \u00c2i,\u03b1 .\nThe perturbing potential will then consist of the external\nperturbation plus the potential arising from the interaction,\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nE\nD\nX\nX\nint\n\uf8ed\u03b4hext\n\u03b4 \u0124 =\n\u00c2j,\u03b2 \u03b4 \u00c2k,\u03b3 \uf8f8\nHj\u03b2,k\u03b3\nj,\u03b2 \u00c2j,\u03b2 (\u03c9) +\nj,\u03b2\n\nk,\u03b3\n\n(7)\n\nwhere [30]\n(3)\n\nAdditionally, we shall find it useful to define kB TF =\nEF \u2261 \u03c0 2 \u03c12 J/4.

The divergent response at \u03c9 = 0 is\nnot shown.\n\nof the form\n\u03b4W\u03c3 (x, t) = V\u03c3 sin kx cos \u03c9t .\n\nIII.\n\nHOMOGENEOUS SYSTEM\n\nThe ground state of a homogeneous Fermi gas with\ncontact interactions can be found exactly by the Bethe\nansatz [9, 10]. For attractive interactions the phase diagram spanned by the two chemical potentials at T = 0\ncontains a fully paired region, a fully polarised (and\ntherefore non-interacting) region and a partially polarised region. The latter is associated with the FFLO\nphase. The mean field ground state was shown to be in\ngood qualitative agreement with the exact ground state\n[29]. The FFLO phase is characterised by an oscillating order parameter with a wavelength \u03bb\u2206 and different\naverage densities \u03c1\u03c3 for the \u2191 and \u2193 particles. As the\npairing suppresses density differences, the density difference \u03c1\u2191 (x) \u2212 \u03c1\u2193 (x) is maximal at the nodes of the order\nparameter and minimal at the anti-nodes. For low polarisations it is possible to describe the system as a fully\npaired superfluid on top of which there is a gas of excess\nmajority spin particles. These are situated at the nodes\nof the order parameter [31, 32]. At zero temperature the\nwavevector k\u2206 = \u03bb2\u03c0\u2206 for the order parameter is given by\nk\u2206 = kF,\u2191 \u2212 kF \u2193 . A possible ground state configuration\nwhere these quantities are illustrated is shown in Fig. 1.\nWith increasing temperature the order parameter disappears. For interaction strengths we are considering, the\nFFLO phase disappears at temperatures T on the order\nof T /TF = 0.1 [33].\n\nA.\n\nSound velocities in an imbalanced gas\n\nWe have investigated the speed of sound in a homogeneous system and how it depends on polarisation. For\nthis we compute the response of the system to potentials\n\n(10)\n\nWe refer to the case V\u2191 = V\u2193 = V0 as a \"spin-symmetric\"\nand V\u2191 = \u2212V\u2193 = V0 as a \"spin-asymmetric\" excitation.\nEq. (10) represents a standing wave perturbation with\na fixed phase. It is sufficient to consider this type of\nperturbation since we find that changing the phase of\nthe perturbation with respect to the phase of the order\nparameter does not change our results in any significant\nway. Throughout this paper we define the response R as\ns\n\u0011\nX\u0010\nR=\n\u03b4\u03c12i,\u2191 + \u03b4\u03c12i,\u2193\n(11)\ni\n\nwhich is a measure of the change in the density.\nFor nonzero polarisations when the FFLO state is\npresent two distinct sound modes exist with in general\ndifferent velocities, as shown in Fig. 2. This can be understood within mean field theory from the fact that the\nFFLO phase breaks both gauge and translational symmetry. However, as we will argue in Sec. III C, these results\nare fully consistent with those expected from exact theory. The sound velocities at T = 0 of these two modes as\na function of the polarisation are shown in Fig. 3. (Small\nfluctuations in the lattice filling due to the technique used\nlead to small variations in the sound velocity [34].) For\nvery low polarisations we effectively have a paired superfluid on top of which there is a weakly interacting gas\nof excess majority spin particles, which are located at\nthe positions of the domain walls in the order parameter\n[31, 32]. In this regime of low polarisation one of the\nsound modes is associated with phase fluctuations of the\norder parameter, and has a very similar velocity as that\nfor a spin balanced superfluid. The other sound mode,\nwith lower velocity, arises from the motions of the excess\nmajority spin particles (the domain walls). The speed of\nsound of this mode becomes very small (below the resolution of our calculation) at very low polarisations, as the\n\n\f4\n\nv/vF\n\n2\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0\n\ndensity per site, \u2206 /EF\n\n(a)\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n0.6\npolarisation\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n\u2206\n\u03c1\u2191\n\u03c1\u2193\n\u03c1\u2191 - \u03c1\u2193\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\nthe broken translational symmetry of the FFLO phase,\nthough this too is fully consistent with exact theory (see\nSec. III C).\nThese low energy sound modes are due to a Brillouin\nzone (BZ) arising from the spatial periodicity of the superfluid order parameter \u2206(x). The consequence is a\ngeneralised Bloch theorem. Let T\u0302 be the operator which\nperforms the transformation: x \u2192 x + \u03bb\u2206 /2, \u2206(x) \u2192\n\u2212\u2206(x). For a system with an FFLO wavelength of \u03bb\u2206 ,\nT\u0302 commutes with the Hamiltonian (1) since \u03c1\u2191 and \u03c1\u2193\nhave periodicities \u03bb\u2206 /2. Note that T\u0302 encodes the smallest translational shift for which such a symmetry exists.\nAs the Hamiltonian commutes with T\u0302 , the density matrix\n\u03c1\u03020 for the equilibrium configuration is invariant under\nT\u0302 \u22121 \u03c1\u03020 T\u0302 and T\u0302 is time-independent.

As\np \u2192 0 the velocity of one of the sound modes disappears. As\nsoon as the domain walls between regions of positive \u2206 and\nnegative \u2206 cease to overlap the sound velocity drops below our\nnumerical resolution. This is because shifting the position of\na domain wall costs very little energy.

Again we investigate the\nresponse of the system to potentials of the form (10).\nHowever, this time we concentrate on short wavelength\nperturbations.\nFor zero temperature there is a clear signature of the\nFFLO phase in the response spectrum of a homogeneous\nFermi gas. As illustrated in Fig. 2 this manifests itself in\nsound modes emerging around k = k \u2217 = 2k\u2206 in addition\nto the ones emerging around k = 0 [17]. Within meanfield theory, this can be understood as a consequence of\n\niE\n1 Dh\n\u00c2\u03b1 (r, t), \u00c2\u03b2 (r\u2032 , \u03c4 ) .\ni\n\n(13)\n\nAs described above, in the self consistent random\nphase approximation \u03b4 \u0124 is given by an externally\napplied perturbation plus a self consistent perturbation.\nConsider free oscillations, i.e.\nthe external\nperturbation is set to zero.\nThen E\u03b4 \u0124 is given by\nD\nP R\n\u03b4 \u0124(\u03c4 ) = \u03b2 dr\u2032 g1d K\u03b2,\u03b3 \u03b4 \u00c2\u03b3 (r\u2032 , \u03c4 ) with K\u03b2,\u03b3 given\n\nby eq. (8). The equations of motion are then given by\nD\nE\nE Z\n\u2202 D\n\u03b4 \u00c2\u03b1 (r, t) =\ndr\u2032 \u03c70\u03b1,\u03b2 (r, r\u2032 , t, t)g1d K\u03b2,\u03b3 \u03b4 \u00c2\u03b3 (r\u2032 , t)\n\u2202t\nZ t\nZ\n\u2202 0\n+\nd\u03c4\ndr\u2032\n\u03c7\u03b1,\u03b2 (r, r\u2032 , t, \u03c4 )\n\u2202t\n\u2212\u221e\nD\nE\n(14)\ng1d K\u03b2,\u03b3 \u03b4 \u00c2\u03b3 (r\u2032 , \u03c4 )\n\n(summation implied). The equations of motion are invariant under the operator T\u0302 provided \u03c70 is invariant\nunder T\u0302 . This can be easily shown to be the case using\nthe fact that T\u0302 \u22121 \u03c1\u03020 T\u0302 = \u03c1\u03020 together with eq. (13).\nThe result of this generalised Bloch theorem is that\nk \u2217 \u2261 (2\u03c0)/(\u03bb\u2206 /2) = 2k\u2206 is a reciprocal lattice vector\nfor the collective mode spectrum. This means that the\nconserved quasimomentum is only defined up to multiples of k \u2217 . Thus it is possible to perturb the system\nat a wavevector q and obtain a response at a wavevector q \u2212 nk \u2217 (n integer) which allows low-frequency sound\nmodes to be excited when q \u2248 nk \u2217 . Note that the generalised Bloch Theorem only states that this is possible.\nThe strength of this response needs to be calculated separately and is determined by the matrix element coupling\nperturbation q to response at q \u2212 nk \u2217 . A smaller am-\n\n\f5\nplitude of the oscillating densities, e.g. due to higher\ntemperature, will lead to a weaker coupling of these responses, see fig. 4. Once the system becomes homogeneous the Brillouin zone structure disappears and the\ncoupling vanishes. Note that this argument implies a BZ\ntwice the size than if the periodicity was simply given by\n\u03bb\u2206 .\n\nC.\n\nMean field theory versus exact theory\n\nWhile the calculations we have presented are within\nRPA mean-field theory, as we now argue, the qualitative\nconclusions are valid more generally. In the above, the\nresponse spectrum was accounted for in terms of the broken translational and gauge symmetry of the mean-field\nstate. As is well known, in a true 1D quantum system\nno continuous symmetries are broken. Thus, the broken\n(phase and translational) symmetries of the mean-field\nFFLO state can lead only to power-law decay of the respective correlation functions [36]. However, the qualitative features described above are the same as those\nexpected from an exact treatment of the system. The\ntransition from the (unpolarised) superfluid phase to the\npartially polarised phase is marked by the closing of the\nspin-gap, leading to a second gapless sound mode. This\ncan be viewed as a Luttinger liquid representing the excess fermions [31]. These excess particles have density\n\u03c1\u2191 \u2212 \u03c1\u2193 , and thus a Fermi wavevector (kF,\u2191 \u2212 kF,\u2193 ). Thus,\nthere are two gapless collective modes, arising from the\nfully paired particles, and the liquid of excess majority\nspin particles. Furthermore, as in the general theory of\nLuttinger liquids [37] the spectral function of these excess majority spin particles will show gapless response\nat multiples of twice their Fermi wavevector. This is\n2(kF,\u2191 \u2212 kF,\u2193 ) = 4\u03c0/\u03bb\u2206 which is precisely the wavevector\nk \u2217 at which one finds the gapless response in mean field\ntheory. Thus, the qualitative features of the collective excitation spectrum obtained in mean-field theory are fully\nconsistent with those expected for the exact system.\n\nD.\n\nTemperature dependence of the collective\nmodes\n\nWe now consider the temperature dependence of the\ncollective response of the homogeneous system. For very\nlow temperature (T . 0.01TF ) we find essentially the\nsame response spectrum as for zero temperature. As\nthe temperature of the system is increased and the order\nparameter disappears, the low energy response around\nk = k \u2217 also disappears, see Fig. 4. This can be explained\nby the fact that the BZ associated with the oscillating\norder parameter disappears. We also observe that as\nthe temperature is increased k \u2217 no longer coincides with\n2(kF,\u2191 \u2212 kF,\u2193 ). We note that thermally excited quasiparticles which do not contribute to the pairing can lead to\nthis departure.\n\nThe results we have presented so far are purely within\nthe collisionless regime. The collisionless regime describes the situation where the rate of quasiparticle collisions is much smaller than the frequency of the excitation. At zero temperature the system is always in the collisionless regime. On the other hand for non-zero temperature there are thermally excited quasiparticles. These\nmay undergo collisions, thereby leading to a nonzero collision rate. As pointed out in Ref. [38], at nonzero temperature great care has to be taken when taking the limits\nk \u2192 0, T \u2192 0. These two limits do not commute. If first\nthe temperature is taken to zero and subsequently k is\ntaken to zero, the system is in the collisionless regime.\nSound modes in the collisionless regime correspond to\nzero sound. On the other hand if first k \u2192 0 and subsequently T \u2192 0 a hydrodynamic description is needed.\nIn the hydrodynamic regime quasiparticles have time to\nscatter many times during the cycle of one collective oscillation and hence the system can be described in terms of\nlocal thermodynamic equilibria. In the crossover region\nno sound propagation is possible due to strong damping.\nWe have performed a simple analysis of the quasiparticle collision rate. In an infinite one-dimensional system\nno quasiparticle excitations can exist due to the divergent nature of the interactions; a Luttinger liquid [37]\ndescription of the system is required [39]. All excitations\nare collective excitations. This manifests itself in an infinite quasiparticle scattering rate. On the other hand, in\na finite system, the quasiparticle scattering rate is finite.\nUsing perturbation theory we find that in a system of\nsize L, for T \u226a TF , the scattering rate of a quasiparticle\nwith energy kB T is\n\"\n!#\n\u221a\n2 2\nkF\ng1d\nT\ne\n3 T\n\u0393=\n+ 2 ln\nkF L\n. (15)\n8\u03c0~EF e + 1 TF\n4\u03c0 TF\nIn general for an infinite system the collisionless approximation will fail since \u0393 diverges. In this case a hydrodynamic theory must be used. However, in practice\nall experimentally relevant systems are finite. Therefore there will be some temperature below which the\nsystem can be described as collisionless. For example,\ncomparing the frequencies with the quasiparticle scattering rate for the system sizes used to compute Fig. 4,\nwe find that in all apart from the four lowest frequency\npoints for T = 0.076TF and the lowest frequency point for\nT = 0.057TF the systems are in the collisionless regime.\nWe therefore expect the results presented in Fig. 4 to be\nqualitatively accurate for systems of this size.\nFor a given system of size L the temperature below\nwhich the system can be considered collisionless may be\nfound as follows. The lowest k vector with which the\nsystem can be excited is given by k = 2\u03c0\nL . Fig. 3 suggests\nthat for the parameters we are considering, the sound\nvelocity v is of the order of the Fermi velocity vF . Then\nusing the fact that the collisionless approximation will\nbe valid up to approximately \u03c9 \u2248 \u0393 and using \u03c9 \u2248 kvF\nwe obtain that for a homogeneous system the maximum\n\n\f6\n\u2206\n\u03c1\u2191\n\u03c1\u2193\n\u03c1\u2191 - \u03c1\u2193\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n-0.1\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n-0.1\n\n-0.2\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\nsite\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n-0.1\n\n-0.2\n50\n\nsite\n\n\u2206\n\u03c1\u2191\n\u03c1\u2193\n\u03c1\u2191 - \u03c1\u2193\n\n0.4\n\n-0.1\n\n-0.2\n50\n\n\u2206\n\u03c1\u2191\n\u03c1\u2193\n\u03c1\u2191 - \u03c1\u2193\n\n0.4\n\ndensity per site, \u2206 /EF\n\ndensity per site, \u2206 /EF\n\ndensity per site, \u2206 /EF\n\n0.3\n\ndensity per site, \u2206 /EF\n\n\u2206\n\u03c1\u2191\n\u03c1\u2193\n\u03c1\u2191 - \u03c1\u2193\n\n0.4\n\n-0.2\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\nsite\n\n250\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\nsite\n\nFIG. 4: (Colour online) Response of a system at fixed chemical potential and different temperatures. The area of the circle is\nproportional to the amplitude of the response, as in Fig. 2. The polarisation is p = 0.15, the interactions strength is \u03b3 = 1.5\nand there are roughly 135 particles. The temperatures are from left to right T /TF = 0.0037, 0.038, 0.057, 0.076. Within our\nmean field theory calculation the oscillating order parameter disappears at a temperature T /TF = 0.07.

Using eq. (16) we find that\nfor the configurations in Fig. 4 the collisionless approximation is valid up to temperatures of around T = 0.05TF .\nFor these systems this temperature coincides roughly\nwith the temperature for which the FFLO phase disappears.\nAbove we argued that for the systems and temperatures studied in this paper we can work in the collisionless regime. The results of our calculations are valid in\nthe regime in which interactions are assumed to be weak\nor moderately strong. On the other hand it has been reported that for strongly interacting 3D imbalanced Fermi\nsystems one needs to consider the effects of collisions\nof quasiparticles even at experimentally achievable low\ntemperatures [19, 40]. There are some fundamental differences between those studies of 3D systems and the\n1D systems of interest here. In the 3D systems, a spin\nimbalanced phase is stable only at relatively high polarisations (beyond the Chandrasekhar-Clogston limit).\nThe collision rate is rapid until the temperature is small\ncompared to the Fermi temperature of the minority component [40], which, in view of the large imbalance, can\nbe a low energy scale. In contrast, in 1D the FFLO\nphase occupies a large region of parameter space, and it\nis possible to have this spin-imbalanced phase with much\nsmaller polarisations when the Fermi energies for spin \u2191\nand \u2193 atoms are of the same magnitude. One then expects that, for strong interactions, the relevant energy\nscale below which collisional scattering starts to become\nsmall is just the (typical) Fermi temperature. Our formulae (15) and (16) were derived using perturbation theory,\nso cannot be applied to determine the collisional scatter-\n\ning rate in the strongly interacting regime. We are not\naware of a calculation of the thermal broadening of the\ncollective modes for a strongly interacting spin- 12 Fermi\nsystem of relevance here.\n\nIV.\n\nTRAPPED SYSTEM\n\nWe now turn our attention to the experimentally\nmore relevant case of the Fermi gas in a harmonic trap.\nWithin the local density approximation (LDA) the possible ground state configurations for 1D Fermi gas at\nT = 0 are known exactly from the Bethe ansatz [9, 10].\nThere are only two possible configurations which are (a)\na partially polarised phase in the middle, with a fully\npaired phase towards the edge and (b) a partially polarised phase in the middle, with a fully polarised phase\ntowards the edge. Recently these configurations have also\nbeen observed in experiment [15]. As shown by Ref. [29]\nBogoliubov de Gennes theory reproduces these ground\nstate configurations and it is in good qualitative agreement with the results of the exact solution combined with\nthe LDA.\nThe low-frequency collective modes in a trap are the\ndipole and the breathing modes. Dipole modes are the\nlowest lying modes with odd parity around the centre\nof the trap. For Vext (x) = 21 m\u03c902 x2 their frequencies in\nthe non-interacting limit are given by \u03c9 = \u03c90 . Breathing modes are the lowest lying modes with even parity.\nThey correspond to expansion and contraction of the\natomic cloud. In the non-interacting limit their frequencies are given by \u03c9 = 2\u03c90 . Both the dipole and breathing\nmodes exist in two types: the spin and density modes. In\nthe density modes the two atomic clouds move in phase\nwhereas in the spin modes the two clouds move largely in\nanti-phase. Within these modes the density dipole mode\nhas a special status. It is called the \"Kohn mode\" and\ncorresponds to rigid body oscillations of the cloud about\nthe centre of the trap. Its frequency \u03c9 is given by \u03c9 = \u03c90\nindependent of the interaction strength.\n\n\f7\nWe now investigate the accuracy of the single mode\napproximation for these low frequency modes.\nA.\n\nSingle mode approximation\n\nThe single mode approximation (SMA) is an important\ntool in calculating collective mode frequencies. Together\nwith sum rules it allows the calculation of collective mode\nfrequencies from ground state properties alone. This can\nbe done as follows: for an operator F\u0302 the dynamic form\nfactor S(\u03c9) describes the strength of the transition from\nthe ground state to state with energy ~\u03c9. S(\u03c9) is given\nby [41]\n\nS(\u03c9) =\n\nX\n\nk6=0\n\n2\n\nhk| F\u0302 |0i \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9k )\n\n(17)\n\nwhere |ki label the exact energy eigenstates of the system. We define the pth moment of the dynamic form\nfactor as\nZ \u221e\nmp =\nS(\u03c9)\u03c9 p d\u03c9 .\n(18)\n0\n\nUsing sum rules it is possible to express m1 , m3 and m\u22121\nas [41]\niiE\n1 Dh h\nF\u0302 , \u0124, F\u0302\n2\ni h h\niiiE\n1 Dhh\nF\u0302 , \u0124 , \u0124, \u0124, F\u0302\nm3 =\n2\n1\nm\u22121 = \u2212 Im \u03c7(F\u0302 , \u03c9 \u2192 0)\n2\nm1 =\n\n(19)\n(20)\n(21)\n\nwhere \u03c7(F\u0302 , \u03c9) is the response function for the operator\nF\u0302 at frequency \u03c9.\nThe SMA corresponds to the assumption that S(\u03c9) is\ndominated by one sharp peak. Then the collective mode\nexcited by the operator\nF\u0302 has a frequency that is given\nq\nmp\nby \u03c9F\u0302 = \u03c9p,p\u22122 = mp\u22122\nfor any value of p. If the SMA\n\nis not exact, and more than one peak is present, one\nfinds that \u03c9p,p\u22122 > \u03c9q,q\u22122 for p > q and this approach\nto finding the collective mode frequency using sum rules\nbecomes less accurate. Nevertheless, \u03c9p,p\u22122 still provides\nan upper bound for the lowest frequency collective mode.\nWe use both \u03c91,\u22121 and \u03c93,1 to obtain upper bounds for\nthe collective mode frequencies.\nIn order to investigate the dipole and the breathing\nmodes we consider two sets of operators\nF\u0302 . For\nP\nP the\ndipole mode we consider F\u0302d (\u03b8) = cos \u03b8 i xi +sin \u03b8 j xj\nwhere indices i run over all the \u2191 particles and j over all\nthe \u2193 particles.\nmodes we consider\nP\nP For the breathing\nF\u0302b (\u03b8) = cos \u03b8 i x2i + sin \u03b8 j x2j . F\u0302d corresponds to applying linear potential V\u2191 (x) = x cos \u03b8 , V\u2193 (x) = x sin \u03b8\nand F\u0302b corresponds to applying a quadratic potential\nV\u2191 (x) = x2 cos \u03b8 , V\u2193 (x) = x2 sin \u03b8.\n\nHere the single mode approximation amounts to assuming that the operator F\u0302 (\u03b8) has at most two peaks\nin the response spectrum, each of which can be made\nto vanish by suitable choice of \u03b8. Hence the collective\nmode frequencies of the two associated modes can be obtained by maximising or minimising \u03c9p,p\u22122 . The lower\nfrequency mode for each F\u0302 is the density mode and the\nhigher frequency mode is the spin mode. [48]\nFor F\u0302d we obtain in the continuum limit two values\nof \u03b8 which maximise or minimise \u03c93,1 . For both T = 0\nk\nand for T > 0 these are \u03b8sd = \u2212 arctan kF,\u2191\nfor the spin\nF,\u2193\n\u03c0\ndipole mode and \u03b8Kohn = 4 for the Kohn mode. For the\nbreathing mode such simple analytical formulae for \u03b8sb\n(spin breathing mode) and \u03b8db (density breathing mode)\nwhich maximise/minimise \u03c9p,p\u22122 could not be obtained.\nThese can be obtained numerically though as has been\ndone in Ref. [10], where the density breathing mode frequency was investigated using sum rules.\nWe have used our results to address the question: how\naccurate is the SMA in describing the results of the\nBdG+RPA approximation?\nFor all the modes mentioned above we find that the\nSMA is strictly speaking not correct, since \u03c93,1 6= \u03c91,\u22121 .\nTo gauge the accuracy of the SMA we have compared the\nprediction of the sum rule for w1,\u22121 with the position of\nthe peak in the response spectrum, see Fig. 5. We choose\n\u03c91,\u22121 because it gives higher accuracy results as it is not\naffected as much by low weight high frequency peaks as\n\u03c93,1 is. For the two density modes which are the lower\nfrequency modes of the two operators Fd and Fb we find\nthat there is very good agreement of the positions of the\npeak as obtained from the response spectrum and the\nSMA. For the density dipole mode (the Kohn mode) the\nsum rule calculation captures the position of the peak\nup to our numerical accuracy. For the density breathing\nmode the accuracy typically is about 1%. In the limit\np \u2192 1 the single mode approximation becomes exact for\nthese two modes as can easily be verified by evaluating\neqs. (19) and (20) for a non-interacting gas.\nHowever, for the spin modes the SMA is not as accurate. In particular for lower polarisations the frequency\nfrom the SMA estimate \u03c91,\u22121 can differ quite significantly\nfrom the position of the lowest frequency peak of the full\nspectrum. This is due to the presence of many small amplitude high frequency peaks. The increased weight of\nthese high frequency peaks and the associated failure of\nthe SMA is correlated with an increase in size of the fully\npaired region towards the edge of the cloud.\n\nB.\n\nCollective mode signature of the FFLO phase\n\nAs described in [17] at T = 0 we find a dramatic signature of the FFLO phase of a trapped Fermi gas when\nthe spin-dipole mode is excited by a short-wavelength\npotential.

This response is independent of whether\nthe ground state configuration is of type (a) or (b), that\nis whether the outside is fully paired or fully polarised.\nThis response for these two types of system is shown in\nFigs. 6 and 7.\nThis response can be understood in\nterms of coupling to the gapless modes at k = \u03bb4\u03c0\u2206 = k \u2217\n0.5\n\n\u2206\n\u03c1up\n\u03c1down\n\u03c1up -\u03c1down\n\n\u2206 /EF\n\n0.3\n\n\u03c1/(N1/2/aho),\n\n0.4\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\nspin-asymmetric excitation\nspin-symmetric excitation\n\nC.\n\nExperimental considerations\n\n0\n-0.1\n-0.2\n-0.3\n-0.4\n0\n\n(a)\n\nof the homogeneous system (see Fig.2 and Sec. III B). A\nsmall deviation from k \u2217 (of the order the inverse system\nsize) allows mixing of this mode to the spin-dipole mode,\ncausing the response at k \u2217 to be apparent in the dipolar\nmotion of the atomic cloud.\nAs in the untrapped system, at very low temperatures\nthe system behaves in the same way as for T = 0. With\nincreasing temperature the oscillating gap \u2206 disappears.\nAlong with it the sharp response at the wavelength \u03bb\u2206 /2\ndisappears, see Fig. 8. There are a few additional noteworthy points. As the temperature is increased the number of modes which can be excited increases. This can\nlead to the splitting of, for example, the spin dipole mode\ninto two near degenerate sub modes. For yet higher temperature further fractionalisation of the modes occurs,\nsee Fig. 8. At intermediate temperatures (Fig. 8(c)) an\noscillating gap can still be made out but the peak in the\nresponse of the spin dipole mode is strongly attenuated,\nwhich may increase the difficulty of finding the FFLO\nphase. An example of a system which at T = 0 is fully\npaired towards the outside is given in Fig. 8, but the case\nwhere the outside is fully polarised at T = 0 is qualitatively similar.\nAs in the homogeneous case discussed in Sec. III B our\ncalculation is performed in the collisionless regime. Using eq. (16) and the LDA by taking the system size to\nbe roughly the size of the cloud we find that the collisionless regime should be valid up to a temperature of\nT /TF \u2248 0.03. This is slightly lower than in Sec. III D\nsince the system size is larger. Nevertheless, the three\nconfigurations in Fig. 8 with an FFLO phase are still in\nthe collisionless regime.\nMost results presented in this paper are for values of\n\u03b3 \u2248 1\u22121.6 where the mean-field theory we use is expected\nto be accurate. (For the groundstate, this is confirmed by\ncomparisons with exact results [29].) We have performed\ncalculations with larger \u03b3, in the range of \u03b3 = 2.2 \u2212 3.8,\nand find qualitatively the same results. While we cannot trust the quantitative results of mean-field theory in\nregimes of strong interactions, particularly at unitarity,\nwe believe that the qualitative results remain valid. In\nparticular, the key signature of the FFLO phase that we\npredict relies only on the commensurability between the\nwavelength of the perturbing potential and the intrinsic\nperiodicity of the FFLO phase, and is expected to be\nrobust.\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nx/(N1/2 aho)\n\n1\n\n(b)\n\n\u03bb\u2206/2\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n\u03bb/(N 2 aho)\n\n1\n\nFIG. 7: (Colour online.)

There are 173 particles, \u03b3 = 0.93, p varies from 0.05 to 0.09. The temperature is T = 0.0005TF ,\nT = 0.005TF , T = 0.02TF and T = .106TF . For the lowest temperature the spin-dipole frequency is \u03c9 = 1.31\u03c90 . The sharp\npeak at the spin-dipole frequency at \u03bb/(N 1/2 aho ) \u2248 0.2 is the signature of the FFLO phase. At higher temperatures, this sharp\nresponse disappears and additional excitations emerge. The case where the outside is fully polarised towards the edge at T = 0\nis qualitatively the same.\n\ncollective modes in the manner described in this paper\nwould lead to direct evidence of the intrinsic modulation\nof the FFLO phase.\nObserving the signature of the FFLO phase in experiments in this way requires the ability to create a variable\nwavelength optical lattice. This can be done using the\ntechnique used by Ref. [42]. Although the signal appears for a spin-symmetric perturbation, the signal is\nclearer for spin-asymmetric perturbations. Thus, any\nspin-dependence of the optical lattice will enhance the\nability to distinguish the peaks associated with the oscillation of \u2206 from the background peaks. For Bosons\n(87 Rb) potentials with spin-dependence have been created by Ref. [43], and would be ideally suited to this\npurpose. There are additional complications associated\nwith applying spin-dependent potentials to 6 Li due to\nincreased loss rates resulting from the application of the\npotentials [44]. As discussed in Ref. [44] it is nevertheless\nin principle possible to set up these potentials. There are\ntwo natural ways to find the response of the spin-dipole\nmode. One way is to follow the approach of the calculation precisely, and make the strength of the optical lattice\ntime dependent, as in Ref. [45]. The spin-dipole mode\ncan then be selectively excited by bringing the temporal\noscillation of the lattice in resonance with the spin-dipole\nmode. Alternatively a static periodic potential can be\napplied to the system and the system allowed to equilibrate. Subsequently this potential is abruptly switched\noff (similar to the approach used in Ref. [46]). This will\nexcite collective modes of many frequencies from which\nthe response of the spin-dipole mode can be obtained by\nFourier transform.\nIn [12] it is maintained that in order to see the FFLO\nphase by in situ imaging it is advantageous to induce\ncoupling between the different 1D tubes in order to align\nthe phases of the FFLO state between the different tubes.\n\nHowever, for the method we are considering this should\nnot be necessary. The response of the system depends on\nthe wavelength with which the system is excited and on\n\u03bb\u2206 . Only one laser is used to create the optical lattice\nwith which the system is excited which implies that the\nwavelength with which the system is excited is the same\nfor all tubes. Therefore, as long as the wavelength of the\nFFLO phase is approximately the same between different\ntubes, the response will be be small or large for the same\nexcitation wavelengths. As a result it should be possible\njust to work with very weakly coupled or uncoupled 1D\ntubes and still see this effect.\nOne experimental difficulty in detecting the FFLO\nphase in systems of the type studied in Ref. [15] \u2013 which\nis shared by all probes of the intrinsic periodicity of the\nFFLO phase \u2013 is the inhomogeneity across the many 1D\ntubes. Due to the different positions of the tubes in the\natomic trap, different tubes will have different chemical\npotentials. In general this will lead to different values\nof \u03bb\u2206 in different tubes. Since the large response occurs\nfor perturbations with \u03bb = \u03bb\u2206 /2 only those tubes which\nmeet the condition on \u03bb\u2206 will show a strong response. If\nall the tubes can only be imaged as a whole it is therefore\ndesirable to work in a regime where \u03bb\u2206 varies minimally\nbetween different tubes. As pointed out by Ref. [12] it\nis possible to choose a point in the phase diagram where\nd\u03bb\u2206\nd2 \u03bb\u2206\nd\u03bc = d\u03bc2 = 0. At this point the value of \u03bb\u2206 should\nbe the same over a large range of tubes in the centre of\nthe system.\nOur method provides a very elegant way to overcome\nthe effects of inhomogeneity, if in situ imaging can allow\nindividual or a small collection of 1D tubes to be resolved.\nThis will allow one to relax the condition of having any\nintertube tunneling and being at a special point in the\nphase diagram. By exciting the whole system with a\n\n\f10\ngiven wavelength \u03bb, only those tubes with \u03bb\u2206 \u2243 2\u03bb will\nhave their spin-dipole oscillations excited. Tubes with\nthe same value for \u03bb\u2206 lie on concentric cylinders around\nthe trap centre. Thus, if imaging of the cloud has sufficient resolution to identify which tubes are oscillating,\none should see response from tubes that lie on a cylindrical region around the axis of the trap. Changing the\nwavelength \u03bb will change the radius of this cylindrical region. In this way the FFLO wavelength could be studied\nas a function of the position of the 1D tube in the trap.\nThis approach is only limited by the power to resolve the\n1D tubes.\nD.\n\nModulation of the coupling constant\n\nWe have investigated the response of the onedimensional Fermi gas to a modulation of the coupling\nconstant. This is an interesting perturbation to consider,\nsince using Feshbach resonances it is relatively easy to implement a uniform modulation of the coupling constant\nexperimentally. Recently it was also found, that in a lattice system parametric modulation can be achieved by\nmodulating the lattice depth [47].\nModulations of the coupling constant couple to density differences. The FFLO state has a density difference that shows quasi-periodic spatial oscillations, as explained above. Hence it is interesting to ask if the response of the system is sensitive to the appearance of the\nordering characteristic of the FFLO phase.\nWithin linear response the modulation of the coupling\nconstant of the form U = U0 + \u03b4U (t) leads to a perturbation of the form\n\u03b4U (t) int\nV\nU0 i,\u03c3\n\u03b4U (t)\n\u03b4\u2206i (t) =\n\u2206i\nU0\n\n\u03b4Wi,\u03c3 (t) =\n\n(22)\n(23)\n\nand hence the response to a modulation of the coupling\nconstant is amenable to our RPA calculation.\nWe have studied the response of the trapped gas to\nmodulations of the coupling constant, focusing on the\nregime of low frequencies. Since a modulation of the coupling constant does not break reflection symmetry about\nthe centre of the trap it can only excite trap modes of\neven parity. As a result the lowest frequency modes which\ncan be excited are the breathing modes.\nWe find that the nature of the response of the system\ndepends strongly on whether the system is in the con-\n\n[1] I.

On the other hand, in\nthe case where the outside is fully paired and there is an\nFFLO phase in the centre the situation is reversed. Most\nof the weight of the responses on the high-frequency spin\nbreathing mode. See Fig. 9.\nWhile the nature of the response is senstive to the\nglobal distribution of particles, whether or not an FFLO\nphase is present makes little difference to the response\nspectrum. We must therefore conclude that there is no\nclear signal of the presence of the FFLO phase in the\ncollective mode spectrum excited by a modulation of the\ncoupling constant. On the other hand the collective mode\nspectrum appears to be sensitive to whether the outside\nregion of the cloud is fully paired or fully polarised.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nTo conclude, we have investigated the collective mode\nspectrum of the imbalanced Fermi gas. The FFLO phase\ncan be detected due to the formation of a characteristic\nperiodicity of the densities. This makes it possible to use\nshort wavelength perturbations which couple to the intrinsic periodicity of the FFLO phase in order to excite\nlong wavelength responses which are easy to measure in\nexperiment. This signal in the collective mode spectrum\npersists up to the temperature where the FFLO phase\ndisappears. We also investigated the accuracy of the single mode approximation. We found that it works very\nwell for density modes, but not as well for spin modes.\nFinally, we found that a modulation of the coupling constant results in a collective mode spectrum which allows\nus to distinguish long wavelength characteristics of the\ndensity profile but not short wavelength characteristics,\nas are associated with the FFLO phase.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank Carlos Lobo for suggesting to\ninvestigate the modulation of the coupling constant and\nfor stimulating discussions.

Our terminology refers\nto the dominant component of the mode for weak interactions where the distinction becomes well defined.\n[49] Fig. 7 (b) is based on the same data as Fig. 3 (b) in [17],\nhowever the label for \u03bb\u2206 /2 is incorrectly placed in [17].\nFig. 7 (b) is correct.\n[50] The phase of the perturbation chosen in eq. (10) im-\n\nplies that the perturbation has odd parity about the trap\ncentre so only odd parity modes can be excited. If the\nphase is chosen such that the perturbation has even parity about the trap centre the low frequency mode excited\nis the spin breathing mode, but the signature is the same.\n\n\f"}
