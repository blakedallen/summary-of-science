This special classical ground state\ncharacterizes several frustrated spin systems, among them giant Keplerate\nmolecules,2 the triangular lattice antiferromagnet, and the kagome lattice\nantiferromagnet.\n\n\fJ. Schnack\n\nThroughout the article the spin systems are modeled by an isotropic\nHeisenberg Hamiltonian augmented with a Zeeman term, i.e.,\nX\nH\n=\n\u2212\nJuv \u223c\n~s (u) * \u223c\n~s (v) + g\u03bcB BS\n.\n(1)\n\u223c\n\u223cz\nu,v\n\n~ is the total spin operator,\n~s (u) are the individual spin operators at sites u, S\n\u223c\nand S\nits z-component along the homogeneous magnetic field axis. Juv are\n\u223cz\nthe matrix elements of the symmetric coupling matrix. In the following we\nwill consider only antiferromagnetic couplings which are characterized by a\nnegative value of Juv .\n\n\u223c\n\n2.\n\nGENERALIZED SIGN RULE FOR SPIN RINGS\n\nRigorous results on spin systems such as the sign rule of Marshall and\nPeierls3 and the famous theorems of Lieb, Schultz, and Mattis 4,5 have sharpened our understanding of magnetic phenomena. With the advent of finite\nsize antiferromagnetic spin rings the question arose whether such general\nstatements can also be made for odd spin rings which are not decomposable\ninto two sublattices, i.e. not bipartite. A key quantity of interest is the shift\nquantum number k = 0, . . . N \u2212 1 associated with the cyclic shift symmetry of the rings. The corresponding crystal momentum is then 2\u03c0k/N . For\nrings with even N (bipartite) one can explain the shift quantum numbers\nfor the relative ground states in subspaces H(M ) of total magnetic quantum\nnumber M .3,4,5 In recent investigations we could numerically verify, that\neven for frustrated rings with odd N astonishing regularities hold. Unifying the picture for even and odd N , we find for the ground state without\nexception:6 The ground state belongs to the subspace H(S) with the smallest\npossible total spin quantum number S. If N*s is integer, then the ground state\nis non-degenerate. If N *s is half integer, then the ground state is fourfold\ndegenerate.\nThe sign rule of Marshall and Peierls can be generalized for all subspaces\nH(M ) with a given total magnetic quantum number:6\nIf N 6= 3\n\nthen\n\nk \u2261 \u00b1a\u2308\n\nN\n\u2309 mod N ,\n2\n\na = Ns \u2212 M .\n\n(2)\n\nMoreover the degeneracy of the relative ground state is minimal. Here \u2308N/2\u2309\ndenotes the smallest integer greater than or equal to N/2. \"Minimal degeneracy\" means that the relative ground state in H(M ) is twofold degenerate\nif there are two different shift quantum numbers and non-degenerate if k = 0\nmod N or k = N/2 mod N , the latter for even N .\n\n\fFrustration effects in magnetic molecules\n\nThe k-rule (2) is founded in a mathematically rigorous way for N\neven,3,4,5 N = 3, a = 0, a = 1, and in part for a = 2.6 For the ground\nstate with N odd and s = 1/2 the k-rule follows from the Bethe ansatz.7\nAn asymptotic proof can be formulated for large enough N for systems with\nan asymptotically finite excitation gap (Haldane systems).6 The k-rule also\nholds for the exactly solvable XY -model with s = 1/2. For N *s being half\ninteger field theory methods yield that the ground state shift quantum number approaches N/4 for large N .8 Apart from these findings a rigorous proof\nof the k-rule still remains a challenge.\n\n3.\n\nROTATIONAL MODES AND MAGNETIZATION JUMPS\n\nFig. 1. Energy spectrum (l.h.s.) of a ring of six antiferromagnetically coupled\nspins s = 5/2 and close-up view of the low-energy part (r.h.s.). The lowest\nrotational bands are highlighted by solid curves.\nAn antiferromagnet that can be decomposed into two sublattices has\nas its lowest excitations the rotation of the N\u00e9el vector as well as spin wave\nexcitations.9 In finite size systems these excitations are arranged in rotational\n(parabolic) bands as shown in Fig. 1 for a ring of six antiferromagnetically\ncoupled spins s = 5/2. Such a behavior is most pronounced for bipartite,\ni.e. unfrustrated systems.10,11\nContrary to this behavior the minimal energies of certain frustrated\nantiferromagnetic molecules of cuboctahedral and icosidodecahedral structure depend linearly on total spin S above a certain total spin.12 Such a\ndependence, which is depicted on the l.h.s. of Fig. 2, results in an unusually\nbig jump to saturation as can be seen on the r.h.s. of Fig. 2. Although\nfirst noticed for the Keplerate molecule {Mo72 Fe30 }, such a behavior is quite\ncommon for a certain class of frustrated spin systems such as the kagome or\nthe pyrochlore lattice.13,14 The underlying reason is that due to the special\ngeometric frustration in such systems \u2013 polygons are surrounded by triangles\n\u2013 the relative ground states in subspaces H(M ) are for big enough M given\n\n\fJ. Schnack\n\nFig. 2. L.h.s.: Minimal energies of the icosidodecahedron for s = 1/2.\nThe highest four levels fall on a straight line. R.h.s.: Resulting (T = 0)magnetization curve. The magnetization jump of \u2206M = 3 is marked by an\narrow.\nby product states of independent localized magnons. Therefore, the energy\nscales linearly with the number of independent magnons which in turn is\nlinearly related to M or S.13\n\n4.\n\nHYSTERESIS WITHOUT ANISOTROPY\n\n0.5\nup cycle (simulation)\ndown cycle (simulation)\nanalytical results\n\nM/Msat\n\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n\nT=0\n\n0.1\n0\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n0.3\nB/Bsat\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\nE\nE2 HM L\nE1 HM L\nE0\n\nM1 M0\n\nM2\n\nM\n\nFig. 3.

R.h.s.: Magnetization curves of the quantum icosahedron for various s at (T = 0).15\n\nThe observation of hysteresis effects in magnetic materials is usually an\noutcome of their magnetic anisotropy. In a recent article we could report\n\n\fFrustration effects in magnetic molecules\n\nthat magnetic hysteresis (Fig. 3, l.h.s., top) occurs in a spin system without\nany anisotropy.15 Specifically, we investigated an icosahedron where classical spins mounted on the vertices are coupled by antiferromagnetic isotropic\nnearest-neighbor Heisenberg interaction giving rise to geometric frustration.\nAt T = 0 this system undergoes a first order metamagnetic phase transition at a critical field Bc between two distinct families of ground state\nconfigurations. The metastable phase of the system is characterized by a\ntemperature and field dependent survival probability distribution. Our exact classical treatment shows that the abrupt transition at T = 0 originates\nin the intersection of two energy curves belonging to different families of\nspin configurations that are ground states below and above the critical field\n(Fig. 3, l.h.s., bottom). The minimum of the two energy functions constitutes a non-convex minimal energy function of the spin system and this gives\nrise to a metamagnetic phase transition. We could also show that the corresponding quantum spin system for sufficiently large spin quantum number s\npossesses a non-convex set of lowest energy levels when plotted versus total\nspin. Fig. 3 (r.h.s.) shows the (T = 0)-magnetization curves for various s.\nThe magnetization plateaus of smallest width are highlighted on each curve.\nAt s = 4 a magnetization jump of \u2206M = 2 occurs, marked by the arrow. At\ns = 3 a tiny plateau persists. The solid curve shows that the field values that\nbisect the smallest plateaus converge to the classical transition field (dashed\nline).\n\n5.\n\nENHANCES MAGNETOCALORIC EFFECT\n\nThe magnetocaloric effect, which consists in cooling or heating of a magnetic system in a varying magnetic field, can assume especially large values\nif the entropy S(T, B) changes drastically as a function of field according to\n\u0001\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202S\n\u2202T\n\u2202B T\n.\n(3)\n= \u2212T\n\u2202B S\nC(T, B)\nThis can for instance happen at phase transitions. In the context of frustrated spin systems huge cooling rates (3) can be achieved for certain topologies in the vicinity of the saturation field due to the large (sometimes even\nmacroscopic) degeneracy of independent magnon states.16,17,18\nFig. 4 shows the isentropes of a cuboctahedron with s = 1/2 (l.h.s.) as\nwell as a spin ring with N = 12 spins s = 1/2 (r.h.s.). The cuboctahedron\nhosts independent magnons and thus features an unusually big magnetization jump to saturation whereas the spin ring does not. Consequently the\nisentropes of the cuboctahedron have a steeper slope above the saturation\nfield, therefore the cuboctahedron exhibits a larger cooling rate.\n\n\fJ. Schnack\n\nFig. 4.
