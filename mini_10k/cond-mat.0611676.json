Schlueter\nMaterials Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL 60439, USA\n\nTakahiko Sasaki\nInstitute for Materials Research, Tohoku University, Sendai 980-8577, Japan\n(Dated: December 6, 2018)\nWe have studied the interlayer resistivity of the prototypical quasi-two-dimensional organic superconductor \u03ba-(BEDT-TTF)2 Cu(NCS)2 as a function of temperature, current and magnetic field,\nwithin the superconducting state. We find a region of non-zero resistivity whose properties are\nstrongly dependent on magnetic field and current density. There is a crossover to non-Ohmic conduction below a temperature that coincides with the 2D vortex solid \u2013 vortex liquid transition. We\ninterpret the behaviour in terms of a model of current- and thermally-driven phase slips caused by\nthe diffusive motion of the pancake vortices which are weakly-coupled in adjacent layers, giving rise\nto a finite interlayer resistance.\n\nOne of the many interesting observations made in layered superconductors is the pronounced broadening of\nthe superconducting transition in a magnetic field, and\ndissipation within the superconducting state [1, 2]. These\neffects have been studied extensively in high-Tc superconductors, and various mechanisms have been discussed\nto explain them, including vortex motion [3], vortexantivortex excitations [4, 5], and Josephson coupling between layers [1]. In general, dissipation of intralayer currents arises from vortex motion, while dissipation of interlayer currents has its origins in phase fluctuations between neighbouring Josephson-coupled layers.\nDespite the interest paid to these effects in high-Tc superconductors, there are few studies of dissipation within\nthe superconducting state in organic superconductors. A\nvery thorough study of dissipation in the intralayer conductivity within the superconducting state of the prototype quasi-two-dimensional organic superconductor \u03ba(BEDT-TTF)2 Cu(NCS)2 [6] was performed by Sasaki\nand coworkers [7]; they identified a region of non-linear\nintralayer conductivity magnetic fields close to the critical field and at temperatures low compared to the critical temperature, which was interpreted as evidence for\na novel vortex \"slush\" state characterised by quantum\nfluctuations of the vortex lattice. Others have investigated the resistive transition in the presence of a magnetic field, and found that it is consistent with vortex\nliquid behaviour [8, 9].\nIn this paper, we examine in detail the dissipation of\ninterlayer currents within the superconducting state in\n\u03ba-(BEDT-TTF)2 Cu(NCS)2 . In our experiment the magnetic field and current are parallel, and aligned perpendicular to the crystal planes; in this configuration, there\nis no Lorentz force on the vortices. We find a region\nwithin the superconducting state which exhibits a nonzero resistivity that is strongly dependent on the mag-\n\nnetic field and current density. We observe non-ohmic\nconduction below a temperature T \u2217 , which is close to\nthe vortex melting transition temperature. We correlate\nthese effects with the temperature at which global intralayer phase coherence is established, as measured by\nthe Meissner effect in the same sample.\nHigh quality single crystal samples, grown by electrochemical techniques [6], were obtained from several\nsources. The samples were typically of dimensions\n1 mm\u00d70.5 mm\u00d70.2 mm; the smallest dimension reliably\ncorresponds to the interlayer direction. Resistance was\nmeasured using the standard four-probe technique. Two\ncontacts were made to each of the large surfaces of the\ncrystal using gold wire and graphite paste. In order to\nensure good thermal contact between the sample and the\nthermometer, both were mounted on a single crystal of\nquartz (which is a good thermal conductor at low temperatures) with thermally conductive grease. An a.c. current of between 1 and 50 \u03bcA (corresponding to current\ndensities of the order of 1 to 50 Am\u22122 ) was applied at\n77.7 Hz; the voltage was detected using an EG&G lockin\namplifier. Measurements were performed in a 4 He flow\ncryostat, equipped with a 17 T Nb3 Sn superconducting\nsolenoid. Zero magnetic field measurements were performed following a thermal cycling of the solenoid above\nits Tc = 18 K, to release remnant flux.\nThe sample was cooled from room temperature to 20K\nat a rate less than 1 K/min [11]. The interlayer resistance\nwas then measured as a function of magnetic field and\ncurrent, while the sample was slowly cooled to 1.8K at a\nrate of \u223c0.5 K/min.\nFigure 1 shows the temperature dependence of the interlayer resistance in zero magnetic field, with applied\ncurrents of 2, 5, 15 and 50\u03bcA (RMS) at 77.7Hz. The\ntransition occuring between 9 K and 11 K is the superconducting transition, as reported by others [12]. At\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: (Colour online) Temperature dependence of interlayer resistance in zero applied magnetic field, for a range of\ncurrents. Inset: critical current density for the onset of dissipation, Jc , as a function of TZR , the temperature at which\nthe resistance becomes zero.\n\ntemperatures below 9 K, there exists a state with low but\nnon-zero resistance. This low-resistance state is strongly\ndependent on current for temperatures between 4 K and\n9 K. For small currents, a zero resistance state is established at temperatures very close to the superconducting transition. However, as the current increases the\ntemperature at which zero resistance occurs, TZR , becomes lower, falling to below 4 K for a current of 50 \u03bcA.\nFurthermore, the resistance is apparently not monotonic\nwith temperature in this region; there is a range of temperatures for which dR/dT is negative. Note that the\nsuperconducting transition between 9 K and 11 K is to a\nlarge extent independent of the applied current, allowing\nus to rule out Joule heating as the cause of the currentdependent finite resistance state at lower temperatures.\nThe inset to figure 1 shows the critical current density,\nJc , (at which zero resistance occurs) as a function of the\ntemperature TZR . While Jc exhibits some sample dependence, a general trend is clear: in all samples it increases\napproximately exponentially as T falls.\nA zero magnetic field current-dependent resistive\nstate can be explained in terms of a thermallyactivated Josephson effect, proposed by Ambegaokar and\nHalperin [13] in 1969. They consider the effect of thermal fluctuations in the vicinity of the superconducting\ntransition, which can lead to phase decoherence between\nthe Josephson-coupled superconducting layers, and thus\nto interlayer dissipation. An interlayer current serves\nto decouple the layers further, so that the thermalfluctuation-induced decoupling persists to lower temperatures. This model may be appropriate for \u03ba-(BEDTTTF)2 Cu(NCS)2 , with its highly two-dimensional structure, large anisotropy parameter and short interlayer coherence length [6].\nGiven the large anisotropy parameter, with this exper-\n\nFIG. 2: (Colour online) (a) The temperature dependence\nof the interlayer resistance in a range of magnetic fields B,\napplied perpendicular to the conducting planes. Traces are\nshown for B = 0 T (highest temperature transition), 0.01 T,\n0.03 T, 0.1 T, 0.3 T, 0.5 T, 0.8 T, 1 T and 2 T. The current\nis 50 \u03bcA. The data are from sample 2.

The I-V response is\nlinear (i.e. the conductivity is Ohmic) above a characteristic\ntemperature T\u2217 . Inset to (b): TZR as a function of Ic for a\nrange of magnetic fields. (c) In grey, the phase diagram of\n\u03ba-(BEDT-TTF)2 Cu(NCS)2 adapted from reference [18]; see\ntext for explanation of data points. T \u2217 is shown for a range\nof magnetic fields for sample 2 (blue triangles) and sample\n3 (red circles); T \u2217 is coincident with the 2D vortex lattice\nmelting line.\n\niment we cannot rule out the possibility that the effect\nis associated with Kosterlitz-Thouless vortex-antivortex\npairs [4, 5, 15]; dissipation arises from the pair-breaking\neffect of intralayer components of the current. Confirmation of this scenario would require measurement\nof the temperature dependence of the intraplane conductivity. Nevertheless, others have invoked Kosterlitz-\n\n\f3\nThouless-like scenarios to explain their observations\nin other quasi-two-dimensional organic superconductors\nsuch as \u03ba-(BEDT-TTF)4 Hg2.89 Br8 [16] and \u03b1-(BEDTTTF)2 NH4 Hg(SCN)4 [17].\nHowever, it should be noted that neither of these models has been shown to give rise to a negative dR/dT as\nwe observe.\nFigure 2(a) shows the temperature dependence of the\ninterlayer resistance in the presence of a magnetic field B\napplied perpendicular to the layers, for a range of fields\n0.01 T < B < 2 T; the current is 50 \u03bcA. The magnetic\nfield stabilises the non-zero-resistance state, with TZR decreasing as the field is applied. For a field of 0.5 T, TZR\nfalls below the lowest temperature studied here, 1.8 K.\nFor small fields, the region of negative dR/dT is extended\nover the zero-field case. For larger fields the superconducting transition moves down in temperature rapidly\nand the non-zero-resistance state contracts.\nFigure 2(b) shows the temperature dependence of the\ninterlayer conductivity in the presence of a magnetic field\nof 0.02 T for a range of currents 2 \u03bcA < I < 50 \u03bcA. The\nnotable feature of these data is that the traces are coincident at high temperatures, and diverge (indicating the\nonset of non-Ohmic conduction) below a temperature T \u2217\n(\u22487 K for B =0.02 T as shown in figure 2(b)), somewhat\nbelow the superconducting transition temperature.\nIn figure 2(c) we compare T \u2217 measured at a range\nof magnetic fields (blue triangles: sample 2, red circles:\nsample 3) with the vortex phase diagram obtained from\nother experiments on the same material (data points in\ngrey, adapted from [18]) . The Hc2 data were obtained\nfrom MHz penetration studies (filled triangles) [18], microwave penetration studies (filled circles) [19], thermal\nconductivity (open circles) [19] and magnetisation (filled\ndiamonds) [20, 21]. The vortex liquid \u2013 2D vortex solid\ntransision is found from the irreversibiliity field in magnetisation (open triangles) and studies of vortex melting\nin magnetometry and microwave response [22, 23]. The\n3D vortex melting line was obtained from muon-spin rotation studies [24]. We find that T \u2217 coincides with the\n2D vortex solid \u2013 vortex liquid melting line, suggesting a\nsimple explanation for the qualitative behaviour that we\nfind.\nIn the vortex liquid state, pancake vortices are fully\nmobile within the planes. Thus the degree of correlation (or lack thereof) between the phases in neighbouring planes is unaffected by a current, and the finite conductivity arising from the phase slips between planes is\nOhmic. (This scenario is related to a model developed by\nKoshelev [10] that describes the in-plane dissipation arising from the thermally activated diffusive motion of pancake vortices.) However, once the temperature falls below the point where a 2D vortex lattice establishes itself\nin each plane, the weak interlayer correlations between\nthese lattices become sensitive to the interlayer current,\ncausing a finite but non-Ohmic interlayer conductivity.\n\nFIG. 3: (Colour online) Real (dark green) and imaginary\n(light green) parts of the magnetization (right-hand scale),\nextracted from a.c. susceptibility measurements in (a) zero\nstatic magnetic field and (b) 0.02 T applied perpendicular to\nthe conducting planes. Also shown are measurements of the\ninterlayer conductivity (left-hand scale) on the same sample\nin similar magnetic field conditions for a range of currents.\nThe dotted vertical line in (b) marks T \u2217 .\n\nThe fact that dR/dT is rather strongly negative for large\ncurrents below T \u2217 suggests that the in-plane ordering of\nvortices allows larger phase-slips between planes to occur\nthan for the vortex liquid case. The origin of this effect\nis not yet clear, but one might, for example, speculate\nthat it is possible for the positions of pancake vortices in\ntwo neighbouring 2D lattices to become anticorrelated,\nrather than just uncorrelated in the vortex liquid case.\nHowever, a quantitive description of this effect is beyond\nthe scope of this paper.\nThe inset to figure 2(b) shows TZR as a function of IC\nfor a range of magnetic fields. TZR can be suppressed\nmonotonically by either a magnetic field or a current.\nHowever, as the magnetic field is increased, the effect of\nthe current is diminished. In the qualitative picture described above, this can be interpreted as indicating that\nboth magnetic field and current serve to induce decoherence of the superfluids in adjacent layers.\nFurther insight may be gained by comparing T \u2217 with\nthe temperature at which the Meissner effect is established. Figure 3(a) shows the real and imaginary parts\nof the magnetisation, obtained from an a.c. susceptibility\n\n\f4\nmeasurement (using a Quantum Design SQUID magnetometer with an a.c. field strength of 30 \u03bcT at a frequency\n990 Hz), as a function of temperature in zero static magnetic field. Also shown is the resistivity measured for a\nrange of currents. The Meissner effect is essentially complete at the onset of the zero-resistance state as measured\nwith a small current. Figure 3(b) shows the same measurement in a static field of 0.02 T applied perpendicular to the sample planes. In contrast to the zero-field\ncase, the Meissner effect is apparently complete at temperatures higher than the onset of zero resistance, even\nfor small applied currents. Indeed, the saturation of the\nmagnetization is well correlated with T \u2217 ; this indicates\nthat, at least for static fields applied perpendicular to the\nsuperconducting planes, the Meissner effect is established\nonce the intralayer 2D vortex lattice is stabilised, and is\nnot dependent on interlayer phase coherence. This supports the use of the Meissner effect as a probe of vortex\nlattice melting and our assignment of T \u2217 , derived from\nresistivity measurements, as the temperature at which\nthis occurs.\nIn previous work, the irreversibility line has been studied using magnetization probes [20, 22]. While there has\nbeen some discussion of the relationship between the irreversibility line and the 2D vortex lattice melting line [20],\nand there is some evidence for their deviation at very low\ntemperatures (the quantum regime) [22], at higher temperatures (in the classical regime studied here) they are\nthought to be approximately coincident [18].\nIn conclusion, we have examined dissipation of\ninterlayer currents within the superconducting state\nof the highly layered superconductor \u03ba-(BEDTTTF)2 Cu(NCS)2 in the temperature range down to\nabout 0.2Tc and as a function of magnetic field. We\ninterpret the existence of a low (but non-zero) resistance\nstate as arising from phase decoherence between the\nsuperfluids in adjacent layers. Above a characteristic\ntemperature T \u2217 , which is magnetic field dependent\nand apparently coincident with the 2D vortex lattice\nmelting line, the resistivity is Ohmic. Below T \u2217 , a\nnon-Ohmic region is interpreted as evidence that the\ncoherence between vortex lattices in neighbouring layers\nis current-dependent.\nThis work is supported by EPSRC.
