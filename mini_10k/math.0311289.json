An explicit description of the invariant ring and some applications to extremality of such codes are obtained\nin the case q = 4.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn 1970 Gleason [5] described a finite complex linear group of degree q under\nwhich the complete weight enumerators of self-dual codes over Fq are invariant.\nWhile for odd q this group is a double or quadruple cover of SL2 (Fq ), for even\nq \u2265 4 it is solvable of order 4q 2 (q \u2212 1) (compare [6]). For even q it is only when\nq = 2 that the seemingly exceptional type of doubly-even self-dual binary\ncodes leads to a larger group.\nIn this paper we study a generalization of doubly-even codes to the non-binary\ncase which was introduced in [11]. A linear code of length n over Fq is called\ndoubly-even if all of its words are annihilated by the first and the second\nelementary symmetric polynomials in n variables. For q = 2 this condition is\nactually equivalent to the usual one on weights modulo 4, but for q \u2265 4 it does\nnot restrict the Hamming weight over Fq . (For odd q the condition just means\nthat the code is self-orthogonal and its dual contains the all-ones word; however\nhere we consider only characteristic 2.) Extended Reed-Solomon codes of rate\n1\nare known to be examples of doubly-even self-dual codes. For q = 4e another\n2\ninteresting class of examples is given by the extended quadratic-residue codes\nof lengths divisible by 4.\n\u2217\n\nAbteilung Reine Mathematik, Universit\u00e4t Ulm, 89069 Ulm, Germany,\nnebe@mathematik.uni-ulm.de\n\u2020 Fachbereich Mathematik, Universit\u00e4t Oldenburg, 26111 Oldenburg, Germany,\nquebbemann@mathematik.uni-oldenburg.de\n\u2021 Mathematics Department, University of California Davis, Davis, CA 95616, USA,\nrains@math.ucdavis.edu\n\u00a7 Information Sciences Research, AT&T Shannon Labs, Florham Park, NJ 079320971, USA, njas@research.att.com\n\n1\n\n\fWe find (Theorems 11 and 16) that the complete weight enumerators of\ndoubly-even self-dual codes over Fq , q = 2f , are invariants for the same type of\nClifford-Weil group that for odd primes q has been discussed in [12], Section\n7.9. More precisely, the group has a normal subgroup of order 4q 2 or 8q 2 (depending on whether f is even or odd) such that the quotient is SL2 (Fq ). Over\nF4 the invariant ring is still simple enough to be described explicitly. Namely,\nthe subring of Frobenius-invariant elements is generated by the algebraically\nindependent weight enumerators of the four extended quadratic-residue codes\nof lengths 4, 8, 12 and 20, and the complete invariant ring is a free module\nof rank 2 over this subring; the fifth (not Frobenius-invariant) basic generator\nhas degree 40. In the final section we use this result to find the maximal Hamming distance of doubly-even self-dual quaternary codes up through length\n24. Over the field F4 , doubly-even codes coincide with what are called \"Type\nII\" codes in [4].\nThe invariant ring considered here is always generated by weight enumerators.\nThis property holds even for Clifford-Weil groups associated with multiple\nweight enumerators, for which a direct proof in the binary case was given in\n[8]. The general case can be found in [9], where still more general types of\ncodes are also included.\n\n2\n\nDoubly even codes\n\nIn this section we generalize the notion of doubly-even binary codes to arbitrary finite fields of characteristic 2 (see [11]).\nLet F := F2f denote the field with 2f elements. A code C \u2264 F n is an F-linear\nsubspace of F n . If c \u2208 F n then the i-th coordinate of c is denoted by ci . The\ndual code to a code C \u2264 F n is defined to be\nC \u22a5 := {v \u2208 F n |\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\nci vi = 0 for all c \u2208 C}.\n\nC is called self-orthogonal if C \u2282 C \u22a5 , and self-dual if C = C \u22a5 .\nDefinition 1 A code C \u2264 F n is doubly-even if\nn\nX\ni=1\n\nci =\n\nX\n\nci cj = 0\n\ni<j\n\nfor all c \u2208 C.\nRemark 2 An alternative definition can be obtained as follows. There is a\nunique unramified extension F\u0302 of the 2-adic integers with the property that\n2\n\n\fF\u0302/2F\u0302 \u223c\n= F; moreover, the map x 7\u2192 x2 induces a well-defined map F\u0302/2F\u0302 \u2192\nF\u0302/4F\u0302, and thus a map (also written as x 7\u2192 x2 ) from F \u2192 F\u0302/4F\u0302. The above\nP\ncondition is then equivalent to requiring that i vi2 = 0 \u2208 F\u0302/4F\u0302 for all v \u2208 C.\nDoubly-even codes are self-orthogonal. This follows from the identity\nX\n\n(ci + c\u2032i )(cj + c\u2032j ) =\n\nX\n\nci cj +\n\nc\u2032i c\u2032j +\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\ni<j\n\ni<j\n\ni<j\n\nX\n\nci\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\nc\u2032i \u2212\n\nn\nX\n\nci c\u2032i .\n\ni=1\n\nNote that Hamming distances in a doubly-even code are not necessarily even:\nExample 3 Let \u03c9 \u2208 F4 be a primitive cube root of unity. Then the code\nQ4 \u2264 F44 with generator matrix\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec1\n\uf8ed\n\n1 1 1 \uf8f7\n\n0 1 \u03c9 \u03c92\n\n\uf8f8\n\nis a doubly-even self-dual code over F4 .\nLet B = (b1 , . . . , bf ) be an F2 -basis of F such that \u03c4 (bi bj ) = \u03b4ij for all i, j =\n1, ..., f , where \u03c4 denotes the trace of F over F2 . Then B is called a selfcomplementary (or trace-orthogonal) basis of F (cf. [10], [11], [15]). Using such\na basis we identify F with F2f and define\n\u03c6 : F \u2192 Z/4Z, \u03c6(\n\nf\nX\n\nai bi ) := wt(a1 , . . . , af ) + 4Z\n\ni=1\n\nto be the weight modulo 4. Since \u03c4 (bi ) = \u03c4 (b2i ) = 1, we have\n\u03c6(a) + 2Z = \u03c4 (a)\nand (considering 2\u03c4 as a map onto 2Z/4Z)\n\u03c6(a + a\u2032 ) = \u03c6(a) + \u03c6(a\u2032 ) + 2\u03c4 (aa\u2032 )\nfor all a, a\u2032 \u2208 F. More generally,\n\u03c6(\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\nci ) =\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03c6(ci ) + 2\u03c4 (\n\nX\n\nci cj ).\n\ni<j\n\ni=1\n\nWe extend \u03c6 to a quadratic function\n\u03c6 : F n \u2192 Z/4Z, \u03c6(c) :=\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03c6(ci ).\n\ni=1\n\nProposition 4 A code C \u2264 F n is doubly-even if and only if \u03c6(C) = {0}.\n3\n\n\fProof. For r \u2208 F, c \u2208 F n ,\n\u03c6(rc) = \u03c6(\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\nrci ) \u2212 2\u03c4 (\n\nX\n\nr 2 ci cj ).\n\ni<j\n\nThis equation in particular shows that \u03c6(C) = {0} if C is doubly-even. ConP\nversely, if \u03c6(C) = {0} then the same equation shows that \u03c4 (r ni=1 ci ) =\nP\n\u03c6( ni=1 rci ) + 2Z = 0 for all r \u2208 F, c \u2208 C. Since the trace bilinear form is\nP\nnon-degenerate, this implies that ni=1 ci = 0 for all c \u2208 C. The same equality\nP\nthen implies that \u03c4 (r 2 i<j ci cj ) = 0 for all r \u2208 F and c \u2208 C. The mapping\nr 7\u2192 r 2 is an automorphism of F, so again the non-degeneracy of the trace\nP\n\u0003\nbilinear form yields i<j ci cj = 0 for all c \u2208 C.\nCorollary 5 Let F n be identified with F2nf via a self-complementary basis.\nThen a doubly-even code C \u2264 F n becomes a doubly-even binary code CF2 \u2264\nF2nf .\nRemark 6 Let C \u2264 F n be a doubly-even code. Then 1 := (1, . . . , 1) \u2208 C \u22a5 .\nHence if C is self-dual then 4 divides n.\nIn the following remark we use the fact that the length of a doubly-even selfdual binary code is divisible by 8.\nRemark 7 If f \u2261 1 (mod 2) then the length of a doubly-even self-dual code\nover F is divisible by 8. If f \u2261 0 (mod 2) then F \u2297F4 Q4 is a doubly-even\nself-dual code over F of length 4.\nMore general examples of doubly-even self-dual codes are provided by extended quadratic-residue codes (see [7]). Let p be an odd prime and let \u03b6 be\na primitive p-th root of unity in an extension field F\u0303 of F2 . Let\ng :=\n\nY\n\na\u2208(F\u2217p )2\n\n(X \u2212 \u03b6 a ) \u2208 F\u0303[X]\n\nwhere a runs through the non-zero squares in Fp . Then g \u2208 F4 [X] divides\nX p \u2212 1, and g lies in F2 [X] if g is fixed under the Frobenius automorphism\nz 7\u2192 z 2 , i.e. if 2 is a square in F\u2217p , or equivalently by quadratic reciprocity if\np \u2261 \u00b11 (mod 8). Assuming f to be even if p \u2261 \u00b13 (mod 8), we define the\nquadratic-residue code QR(F, p) \u2264 F p to be the cyclic code of length p with\ngenerator polynomial g. Then dim(QR(F, p)) = p \u2212 deg(g) = p+1\n, which is\n2\np+1\ng\nalso the dimension of the extended code QR(F, p) \u2264 F .\nFrom [7, pages 490, 508] together with Proposition 4 we obtain the following\n(the case F = F4 was given in [4, Proposition 4.1]):\nProposition 8 Let p be a prime, p \u2261 3 (mod 4). Then the extended quadratic4\n\n\fg\nresidue code QR(F,\np) is a doubly-even self-dual code.\n\n3\n\nComplete weight enumerators and invariant rings\n\nIn this section we define the action of a group of C-algebra automorphisms on\nthe polynomial ring C[xa | a \u2208 F] such that the complete weight enumerators\nof doubly-even self-dual codes are invariant under this group.\nDefinition 9 Let C \u2264 F n be a code. Then\ncwe(C) :=\n\nn\nXY\n\nc\u2208C i=1\n\nxci \u2208 C[xa | a \u2208 F]\n\nis the complete weight enumerator of C.\nFor an element r \u2208 F let mr and dr be the C-algebra endomorphisms of\nC[xa | a \u2208 F] defined by\nmr (xa ) := xar , dr (xa ) := i\u03c6(ar) xa\n\nfor all a \u2208 F,\n\n\u221a\nwhere i = \u22121 and \u03c6 : F \u2192 Z/4Z is defined as above via a fixed selfcomplementary basis. We also have the MacWilliams transformation h defined\nby\nX\nh(xa ) := 2\u2212f /2 (\u22121)\u03c4 (ab) xb for all a \u2208 F.\nb\u2208F\n\nDefinition 10 The group\nGf := hh, mr , dr | 0 6= r \u2208 Fi\nis called the associated Clifford-Weil group.\nGleason ([5]) observed that the complete weight enumerator of a self-dual code\nC remains invariant under the transformations h and mr . If C is doubly-even,\nthen cwe(C) is invariant also under each dr (Proposition 4). Therefore we have\nthe following theorem.\nTheorem 11 The complete weight enumerator of a doubly-even self-dual code\nover F lies in the invariant ring\nInv(Gf ) := {p \u2208 C[xa | a \u2208 F] | pg = p for all g \u2208 Gf }.\nBy the general theory developed in [9] one finds that a converse to Theorem\n11 also holds:\n5\n\n\fTheorem 12 The invariant ring of Gf is generated by complete weight enumerators of doubly-even self-dual codes over F.\nIn the case f = 1 Gleason obtained the more precise information\nInv(G1 ) = C[cwe(H8 ), cwe(G24 )]\nwhere H8 and G24 denote the extended Hamming code of length 8 and the\nextended Golay code of length 24 over F2 .\nIn general, the Galois group\n\u0393f := Gal(F/F2 )\nacts on Inv(Gf ) by \u03b3(xa ) := xa\u03b3 for all a \u2208 F, \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393f . Let Inv(Gf , \u0393f ) denote\nthe ring of \u0393f -invariant polynomials in Inv(Gf ).\nTheorem 13\nInv(G2 , \u03932 ) = C[cwe(Q4 ), cwe(Q8 ), cwe(Q12 ), cwe(Q20 )]\nwhere Qp+1 denotes the extended quadratic-residue code of length p + 1 over\nF4 (see Proposition 8). The invariant ring of G2 is a free module of rank 2\nover Inv(G2 , \u03932 ):\nInv(G2 ) = Inv(G2 , \u03932 ) \u2295 Inv(G2 , \u03932 )p40\nwhere p40 is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 40 which is not invariant\nunder \u03932 .\nProof. Computation shows that hG2 , \u03932 i is a complex reflection group of order\n29 3 * 5 (Number 29 in [13]) and G2 is a subgroup of index 2 with Molien series\n1 + t40\n.\n(1 \u2212 t4 )(1 \u2212 t8 )(1 \u2212 t12 )(1 \u2212 t20 )\nBy Proposition 8 the codes Qi (i = 4, 8, 12, 20) are doubly-even self-dual\ncodes over F4 . Their complete weight enumerators (which are \u03932 -invariant) are\nalgebraically independent elements in the invariant ring of G2 as one shows by\nan explicit computation of their Jacobi matrix. Therefore these polynomials\ngenerate the algebra Inv(G2 , \u03932 ).\n\u0003\nBy Theorem 12 we have the following corollary.\nCorollary 14 There is a doubly-even self-dual code C over F4 of length 40\nsuch that cwe(C) is not Galois invariant.\nA code with this property was recently constructed in [2].\n6\n\n\fFor f > 2 the following example shows that we cannot hope to find an explicit\ndescription of the invariant rings of the above type.\nExample 15 The Molien series of G3 is N/D, where\nD = (1 \u2212 t8 )2 (1 \u2212 t16 )2 (1 \u2212 t24 )2 (1 \u2212 t56 )(1 \u2212 t72 )\nand N(t) = M(t) + M(t\u22121 )t216 with\nM = 1 + 5t16 + 77t24 + 300t32 + 908t40 + 2139t48 + 3808t56 + 5864t64\n+8257t72 + 10456t80 + 12504t88 + 14294t96 + 15115t104 .\nThe Molien series of hG3 , \u03933 i is (L(t) + L(t\u22121 )t216 )/D, where D is as above\nand\nL = 1 + 3t16 + 29t24 + 100t32 + 298t40 + 707t48 + 1268t56 + 1958t64\n+2753t72 + 3482t80 + 4166t88 + 4766t96 + 5045t104 .\n\n4\n\nThe structure of the Clifford-Weil groups Gf\n\nIn this section we establish the following theorem.\nTheorem 16 The structure of the Clifford-Weil groups Gf is given by\nGf \u223c\n= Z.(F \u2295 F). SL2 (F)\nwhere Z \u223c\n= Z/8Z if f is odd.\n= Z/4Z if f is even, and Z \u223c\nTo prove this theorem, we first construct a normal subgroup Nf \u2702 Gf with\n1+2f\nNf \u223c\n= Z/4ZY2+ , the central product of an extraspecial group of order 21+2f\nwith the cyclic group of order 4. The image of the homomorphism Gf /Nf \u2192\nOut(Nf ) is isomorphic to SL2 (F) and the kernel consists of scalar matrices\nonly.\nLet qr := (d2r )h = hd2r h and\nNf := hd2r , qr , i id | r \u2208 Fi.\nUsing the fact that (\u22121)\u03c6(b) = (\u22121)\u03c4 (b) for all b \u2208 F, we find that\nd2r (xa ) = (\u22121)\u03c4 (ar) xa , qr (xa ) = xa+r .\nFor the chosen self-complementary basis (b1 , . . . , bf ), qbj commutes with d2bk if\nj 6= k and the commutator of qbj and d2bj is \u2212 id. From this we have:\n7\n\n\fRemark 17 The group Nf is isomorphic to a central product of an extraspe1+2f\nwith the center Z(Nf ) \u223c\ncial group hqbj , d2bj | j = 1, . . . , f i \u223c\n= Z/4Z.\n= 2+\nThe representation of Nf on the vector space \u2295a\u2208F Cxa of dimension 2f is the\nunique irreducible representation of Nf such that t \u2208 Z/4Z acts as multiplication by it .\nConcerning the action of Gf on Nf we have\n2\n\u22121\n\u2217\nma d2r m\u22121\na = da\u22121 r , ma qr ma = qar , for all a, r \u2208 F .\n\nSince ma conjugates dr to da\u22121 r it suffices to calculate the action of d1 :\n\u03c6(r)\n2\n\u22121\nqr d2r , for all r \u2208 F.\nd1 d2r d\u22121\n1 = dr , d1 qr d1 = i\n\nThis proves\nLemma 18 The image of the homomorphism Gf \u2192 Aut(Nf /Z(Nf )) is isomorphic to SL2 (F) via\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n0 1\uf8f7\n\uf8ec1\n\uf8eca 0 \uf8f7\nh 7\u2192 \uf8ec\n\uf8f8 , d1 7\u2192 \uf8ed\n\uf8f8 , ma 7\u2192 \uf8ed\n\uf8ed\n1\n0 a\u22121\n10\n\n\uf8f6\n\n0\uf8f7\n1\n\n\uf8f8.\n\nElementary calculations or explicit knowledge of the automorphism group of\nNf (see [14]) show that the kernel of the above homomorphism is Nf CGf (Nf ) =\nNf (Gf \u2229 C\u2217 id). It remains to find the center of Gf , which by the calculations\nabove contains i id. If f is even, then cwe(Q4 \u2297F4 F) is an invariant of degree 4\nof Gf , so the center is isomorphic to Z/4Z in this case. To prove the theorem,\nit remains to construct an element \u03b68 id \u2208 Gf if f is odd, where \u03b68 \u2208 C\u2217 is a\nprimitive 8-th root of unity.\nLemma 19 If f is odd, then h(hd1 )3 i = h\u03b68 idi.\nProof. (hd1 )3 acts trivially on Nf /Z(Nf ). Explicit calculation shows that\n(hd1 )3 commutes with each generator of Nf , hence acts as a scalar. We find\nthat\n1 1 X \u03c6(c+b)\ni\n(\u22121)\u03c4 (c) x0 .\n(hd1 )3 (x0 ) = q\n|F|\n|F|\nb,c\u2208F\nThe right hand side is an 8-th root of unity times x0 . If f is odd, then\nmentioned, which implies that this is a primitive 8-th root of unity.\n\n8\n\n\u221a\n\n2 is\n\u0003\n\n\f5\n\nExtremal codes\n\nLet C \u2264 F n be a code. The complete weight enumerator cwe(C) \u2208 C[xa | a \u2208\nF] may be used to obtain information about the Hamming weight enumerator, which is the polynomial in a single variable x obtained from cwe(C) by\nsubstituting x0 7\u2192 1 and xa 7\u2192 x for all a 6= 0.\nRemark 20 (a) If F\u2032 \u2264 F is a subfield of F and e = [F : F\u2032 ], then C becomes\na code CF\u2032 of length en over F\u2032 by identifying F with F\u2032 e with respect to a\nP\nself-complementary basis (b1 , . . . , be ). If a = ei=1 ai bi with ai \u2208 F\u2032 , then the\ncomplete weight enumerator of CF\u2032 is obtained from cwe(C) by replacing xa by\nQe\ni=1 xai .\n(b) We may also construct a code C \u2032 of length n over F\u2032 from C by taking the\nF\u2032 -rational points:\nC \u2032 := {c \u2208 C | ci \u2208 F\u2032 for all i = 1, . . . , n}.\nThe dimension of C \u2032 is at most the dimension of C, and the complete weight\nenumerator of C \u2032 is found by the substitution xa 7\u2192 0 if a 6\u2208 F\u2032 . C \u2032 is called\nthe F\u2032 -rational subcode of C.\nAs an application of Theorem 13 we have the following result. Note that the\nresults for lengths n \u2264 20 also follow from the classification of doubly-even\nself-dual codes in [4], [3] and [1], and the bound for length 20 can be deduced\nfrom [4, Cor. 3.4].\nTheorem 21 Let F := F4 . The maximal Hamming distance d = d(C) of a\ndoubly-even self-dual code C \u2264 F n is as given in the following table:\nn 4 8 12 16 20 24\nd34 6 6 8 8\nFor n = 4 and 8, the quadratic-residue codes Q4 resp. Q8 are the unique codes\nC of length n with d(C) = 3 resp. d(C) = 4.\n2\nProof. Let p \u2208 C[x0 , x1 , x\u03c9 , x\u03c92 ]G\nn , a homogeneous polynomial of degree n. If\np is the complete weight enumerator of a code C with d(C) \u2265 d, then the\nfollowing conditions must be satisfied.\n\na)\nb)\nc)\nd)\ne)\n\nAll coefficients in p are nonnegative integers.\nThe coefficients of xa0 xb1 xb\u03c9 xb\u03c92 with b > 0 are divisible by 3.\np(1, 1, 1, 1) = 2n .\np(1, 1, 0, 0) = 2m for some m \u2264 n2 .\np(1, x, x, x) \u2212 1 is divisible by xd .\n9\n\n\fOne easily sees that Q4 is the unique doubly-even self-dual code over F of\nlength 4. If C is such a code of length 8 with d(C) \u2265 4, then cwe(C) is\nuniquely determined by condition e). In particular the F2 -rational subcode of\nC has dimension 4 and is a doubly-even self-dual binary code of length 8.\nHence C = H8 \u2297 F = Q8 . If C \u2264 F 12 is a doubly-even self-dual code with\nd(C) \u2265 6, then again cwe(C) = cwe(Q12 ) is uniquely determined by condition\ne), moreover Q12 has minimal distance 6.\n2\nFor n = 16, there is a unique polynomial p(x0 , x1 , x\u03c9 , x\u03c92 ) \u2208 C[x0 , x1 , x\u03c9 , x\u03c92 ]G\n16\nsuch that p(1, x, x, x) \u2261 1 + ax7 (mod x8 ). This polynomial p has negative coefficients. Therefore the doubly-even self-dual codes C \u2264 F 16 satisfy d(C) \u2264 6.\nThere are two candidates for polynomials p satisfying the five conditions above\nwith d = 6. The rational subcode has either dimension 2 or 4 and all words\n6= 0, 1 are of weight 8. One easily constructs such a code C from the code\nQ20 , by taking those elements of Q20 that have 0 in four fixed coordinates,\nomitting these 4 coordinates to get a code of length 16, adjoining the all-ones\nvector and then a vector of the form (18 , 08) from the dual code. CF2 \u2264 F232\nis isomorphic to the extended binary quadratic-residue code and the rational\nsubcode of C is 2-dimensional.\n\nFor n = 20 we similarly find four candidates for complete weight enumerators\nsatisfying a) - e) above with d = 8 (where the dimension of the rational subcode\nis 1, 3, 5 or 7). None of these satisfies e) with d > 8. The code Q20 has minimal\nweight 8 and its rational subcode is {0, 1}. For n = 24, the code Q24 = F4 \u2297G24\n2\nhas d(C) = 8. To see that this is best possible let p \u2208 C[x0 , x1 , x\u03c9 , x\u03c92 ]G\n24\nsatisfy (b) and (e) above with d = 9. Then p = p0 + ah1 + bh2 , for suitable\np0 , h1 , h2 with hi (1, x, x, x) \u2261 0 (mod x9 ), p0 (1, x, x, x) \u2261 1 (mod x9 ) and\na, b \u2208 Z. Explicit calculations then show that p0 (1, 1, 0, 0), h1 (1, 1, 0, 0) and\nh2 (1, 1, 0, 0) are all divisible by 3. Therefore p(1, 1, 0, 0) is not a power of 2,\nhence p does not satisfy condition d).\n\u0003\n\nAcknowledgment. We thank O.
