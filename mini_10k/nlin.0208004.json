Under precisely stated hypotheses, the two are proved to be\nproportional, by a constant 4/3, and to appear as a nonnegative defect measure in the local\nenergy balance of singular (distributional) solutions of the incompressible Euler equations.\nHere we prove that the energy defect measure can be represented also by a triple moment of\npurely longitudinal velocity increments and by a mixed moment with one longitudinal and\ntwo tranverse velocity increments. Thus, we prove that the traditional 4/5- and 4/15-laws of\nKolmogorov hold in the same local sense as demonstrated for the 4/3-law by Duchon-Robert.\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nRecently, Duchon and Robert [1] have established an energy balance relation for distributional\nsolutions of the three-dimensional (3D) incompressible Euler equations. Their balance relation\ncontains a \"defect\" or \"anomaly\" term, with an interesting connection to turbulence theory.\nSince the work of Duchon-Robert provides the point of departure of the present paper, it is\nappropriate to describe their theorems briefly here. For our purposes, there are three main\nresults:\nFirst, if u \u2208 L3 ([0, T ] \u00d7 T3 ) is a weak solution of the incompressible Euler equations on the\n3-torus T3 , then it is proved in [1] (Proposition 2) that the following local balance holds in the\nsense of distributions:\n1\n1\n\u2202t ( |u|2 ) + \u2207*[( |u|2 + p)u] = \u2212D(u).\n2\n2\n\n(1.1)\n\nHere D(u) is a defect distribution which for classical solutions vanishes identically, implying\nlocal energy conservation. Duchon and Robert also establish various expressions for the defect\nterm. In particular, they have shown that\n1\nD(u) = D\u2212 lim\n\u03b5\u21920\n4\n\nZ\n\n\u2207\u03c6\u03b5 (l)*\u03b4u(l)|\u03b4u(l)|2 d3 l\n\n(1.2)\n\nT3\n\nwhere D\u2212 lim means limit in the sense of distributions on [0, T ] \u00d7 T3 , with \u03c6 \u2208 C0\u221e (T3 ), even,\nnonnegative with unit integral, \u03c6\u03b5 (x) = \u03b5\u22123 \u03c6(x/\u03b5), and \u03b4u(x, t; l) = u(x + l, t) \u2212 u(x, t).\nThis expression is remarkable because it is closely connected with an exact result in turbulence\ntheory, the so-called \"K\u00e1rm\u00e1n-Howarth-Monin relation\":\n\u2207*h\u03b4u(l)|\u03b4u(l)|2 i = \u22124\u03b5\u0304.\n\n(1.3)\n\nSee [2], section 6.2.1. In this relation, \u03b5\u0304 = \u03bdh|\u2207u\u03bd |2 i is the mean energy dissipation for a\nNavier-Stokes solution u\u03bd , which is assumed to remain finite as viscosity \u03bd tends to zero. We\nsee that this result is essentially equivalent to the statement that the Duchon-Robert defect\nsatisfy hDi = \u03b5\u0304.\n\n2\n\n\fFor a general distributional solution of Euler, there need be no connection of the defect\nwith viscous dissipation, nor need it even be true that D(u) \u2265 0. However, a second theorem\n(Proposition 4) in [1] states that, if u\u03bd is a Leray solution of incompressible Navier-Stokes\nequation for viscosity \u03bd and if u\u03bd \u2192 u strong in L3 ([0, T ] \u00d7 T3 ) as \u03bd \u2192 0, then\nD(u) = D\u2212 lim[\u03bd|\u2207u\u03bd |2 + D(u\u03bd )]\n\u03bd\u21920\n\n(1.4)\n\nSince it is well-known that D(u\u03bd ) \u2265 0 for Leray solutions, thus also D(u) is a nonnegative\ndistribution, i.e. a Radon measure ([3], Example 12.5). This theorem may be paraphrased as\nsaying that strong viscosity solutions of the incompressible Euler equations are also dissipative\nsolutions.\nFinally, Duchon and Robert, under an additional hypothesis, establish an even simpler form\nof the defect distribution. With \u03c9 unit Haar measure on S 2 , they define the function\n1\nS(u, l)(x, t) :=\nl\n\nZ\n\nS2\n\nd\u03c9(l\u0302)\u03b4uL (x, t; l)|\u03b4u(x, t; l)|2 .\n\n(1.5)\n\nin L1 ([0, T ] \u00d7 T3 ). Here \u03b4uL (x, t; l) = l\u0302*\u03b4u(x, t; l) is the longitudinal velocity increment. Assuming that the following limit exists\nS(u)(x, t) := D\u2212 lim S(u, l)(x, t)\nl\u21920\n\n(1.6)\n\nDuchon and Robert [1], Section 5 show that\n4\nS(u) = \u2212 D(u).\n3\n\n(1.7)\n\nThis is a rigorous form of another well-known relation in turbulence theory, sometimes called\nthe \"4/3-law\":\n4\nh\u03b4uL (l)|\u03b4u(l)|2 i \u223c \u2212 \u03b5\u0304l.\n3\n\n(1.8)\n\nSee [4]. It is well-known that the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n-Howarth-Monin relation reduces to the 4/3-law under\nconditions of local isotropy. This is achieved here by the angle average over the sphere in (1.5).\n\n3\n\n\fSuch relations as (1.3) and (1.8) in turbulence theory go back to the original work of A.\nN. Kolmogorov [5]. However, Kolmogorov in fact proved a relation involving only longitudinal\nvelocity increments, the so-called \"4/5-law\":\n4\nh[\u03b4uL (l)]3 i \u223c \u2212 \u03b5\u0304l\n5\n\n(1.9)\n\nThis was established from the Navier-Stokes equations, under conditions of statistical homogeneity and local isotropy and with the assumption that energy dissipation remains finite in the\nzero-viscosity limit. It is our purpose here to establish an expression for the Duchon-Robert\nenergy dissipation anomaly D(u) with exactly the form of Kolmogorov's law. Our proof yields\nanother expression which is related to the so-called \"4/15-law\":\nh\u03b4uL (l)|\u03b4uT (l)|2 i \u223c \u2212\n\n4\n\u03b5\u0304l\n15\n\n(1.10)\n\nHere \u03b4uT (l) = t\u0302*\u03b4u(l) is a transverse velocity increment, with t\u0302 any unit vector orthogonal\nto l\u0302. This relation is known to hold under the same conditions as the 4/5-law. The rigorous\nderivation of the 4/5- and 4/15-laws given here, under precisely stated assumptions, yields a\nresult with a wider domain of validity than that of some previous rigorous derivations, such as\nthat of Nie and Tanveer [6]. In particular, the form of the 4/5-law established here-like the\nDuchon-Robert version of the 4/3-law-is local, in the sense that it relates third-order moments\nof velocity increments and viscous dissipation averaged over the same bounded spacetime region,\nnot necessarily large.\nIn the following section we prove our main theorem. In a final discussion section we discuss\nbriefly its physical significance and a compare it with previous results. Let us now make just\na few remarks on notations: The symbol Lp will be used below for Lp ([0, T ] \u00d7 T3 ). If F (x, t)\nis any spacetime distribution, we denote F \u03b5 (x, t) = (\u03c6\u03b5 \u2217 F )(x, t), where \u03c6 \u2208 C0\u221e (T3 ) and \u2217\nis space convolution. Thus, F \u03b5 remains, for each fixed x, a distribution in t. Often below, as\nabove, we omit the variables (x, t) where their presence is clear from the context.\n\n4\n\n\f2\n\nThe Main Theorem\n\nWe prove the following:\nTheorem 1 Let u \u2208 L3 ([0, T ] \u00d7 T3 ) be a weak solution of the incompressible Euler equations\non the 3-torus T3 . Let \u03c6(l) be any C \u221e function with compact support, nonnegative with unit\nintegral, spherically symmetric, and let \u03c6\u03b5 (l) = \u03b5\u22123 \u03c6(l/\u03b5). Finally, define longitudinal and\ntransverse velocity increments as\n\u03b4uL (x, t; l) = (l\u0302 \u2297 l\u0302)\u03b4u(x, t; l), \u03b4uT (x, t; l) = (1 \u2212 l\u0302 \u2297 l\u0302)\u03b4u(x, t; l),\nThen, the following functions in L1 ([0, T ] \u00d7 T3 )\n\u001a\n\u001b\nZ\n3\n2 \u03b5\n\u03b5\n3\n\u03b5\n2\n2\nDL (u) =\nd l \u2207\u03c6 (l)*\u03b4u(l)|\u03b4uL (l)| + \u03c6 (l)\u03b4uL (l)|\u03b4uT (l)| ,\n4 T3\nl\n\n(2.1)\n\n(2.2)\n\nand\nDT\u03b5 (u)\n\n3\n=\n8\n\n\u001a\n\u001b\n2 \u03b5\n\u03b5\n2\n2\nd l \u2207\u03c6 (l)*\u03b4u(l)|\u03b4uT (l)| \u2212 \u03c6 (l)\u03b4uL (l)|\u03b4uT (l)| ,\nl\nT3\n\nZ\n\n3\n\n(2.3)\n\nboth converge in the sense of distributions as \u03b5 \u2192 0 to D(u), where the latter is the defect\ndistribution in the local energy balance for u,\n1\n1\n\u2202t ( |u|2 ) + \u2207*[( |u|2 + p)u] = \u2212D(u),\n2\n2\n\n(2.4)\n\nestablished earlier by Duchon-Robert.\nWe shall prove this theorem in several steps.\nThe idea of the proof is to consider separate balance equations for the longitudinal and\ntransverse components of the energy. We define first longitudinal and transverse velocities\nrelative to a vector l:\nuL (x, t; l) = (l\u0302 \u2297 l\u0302)*u(x + l, t), uT (x, t; l) = (1 \u2212 l\u0302 \u2297 l\u0302)*u(x + l, t).\n\n(2.5)\n\nOf course, uL + uT = u.

To prove (2.9), we use the elementary relation \u2207l\u0302 = 1 \u2212 l\u0302 \u2297 l\u0302.\nA simple computation then gives, for example,\n\u2207*\u03a0\u03b5L (x, t)\n\n\u001b\nd\u03c6\u03b5\n2 \u03b5\n(l) + \u03c6 (l) l\u0302 p(x + l, t),\ndl\nl\n\n(2.12)\n\n\u001b\nd\u03c6\u03b5\n2 \u03b5\n(l) + \u03c6 (l) l\u0302.\ndl\nl\n\n(2.13)\n\nd l\n\n\u001a\n\n\u2207\u03c6L (l) =\n\n\u001a\n\n=\u2212\n\nZ\n\n3\n\nT3\n\nFrom its definition,\n\nThis gives easily \u2207*\u03a0\u03b5L = \u2207p\u03b5L in the sense of distributions.

Thus, \u2207*u\u03b5L = 0.\nSince u\u03b5L + u\u03b5T = u\u03b5 , then also \u2207*u\u03b5T = 0.\nFrom the equations (2.14) for X = L, T , the incompressibility conditions for u\u03b5L and u\u03b5T ,\nand the Euler equations for u (in distribution sense), we derive the following balance equations\n4\n2\u2202t (u*u\u03b5L ) + \u2207*[2(u*u\u03b5L )u + ((uL *uL )u)\u03b5 \u2212 (uL *uL )\u03b5 u + 2pu\u03b5L + 2p\u03b5L u] = \u2212 DL\u03b5 (u),\n3\n\n(2.17)\n\nand\n8\n2\u2202t (u*u\u03b5T ) + \u2207*[2(u*u\u03b5T )u + ((uT *uT )u)\u03b5 \u2212 (uT *uT )\u03b5 u + 2pu\u03b5T + 2p\u03b5T u] = \u2212 DT\u03b5 (u).

From this result and the definition of u\u03b5L it follows that\n1\nu\u03b5L (x, t) \u2212 u(x, t) =\n3\n\nZ\n\nd3 l \u03c6\u03b5 (l)l\u0302 \u2297 l\u0302*[u(x + l, t) \u2212 u(x, t)].\n\n(2.22)\n\nT3\n\nThus,\nku\u03b5L\n\n1\n\u2212 ukL3 \u2264\n3\n\nZ\n\nT3\n\nd3 l \u03c6\u03b5 (l)ku(* + l) \u2212 ukL3 .\n\n(2.23)\n\nBecause u \u2208 L3 , it follows by a standard approximation argument that ku(* + l) \u2212 ukL3 \u2192 0 as\nl \u2192 0. Hence, it follows from (2.23) that ku\u03b5L \u2212 13 ukL3 \u2192 0 as \u03b5 \u2192 0, as was claimed. Because\nu\u03b5T = u\u03b5 \u2212 u\u03b5L , we also deduce that ku\u03b5T \u2212 23 ukL3 \u2192 0.\nNext we show that p\u03b5L \u2192\n\nand p\u03b5T \u2192\n\n1\n3p\n\n2\n3p\n\nstrong in L3/2 as \u03b5 \u2192 0. First, observe that\n\np = (\u2212\u25b3)\u22121 \u2202i \u2202j (ui uj ), so that p \u2208 L3/2 by the Calder\u00f3n-Zygmund inequality. From the\ndefinitions of \u03c6T and p\u03b5T it follows easily that\np\u03b5T (x, t) =\n\n2\n* 4\u03c0\n3\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nl\u20322 dl\u2032 \u03c6\u03b5 (l\u2032 ) *\n\n0\n\n1\n|Bl\u2032 |\n\nZ\n\nd3 l p(x + l, t),\n\n(2.24)\n\nBl\u2032\n\nwhere Bl is the ball of radius l centered at the origin and |Bl | is its volume.

Since p\u03b5L = p\u03b5 \u2212 p\u03b5T , also\nkp\u03b5L \u2212 31 pkL3/2 \u2192 0.\n8\n\n\fEntirely similar arguments show that ((uX *uX )u)\u03b5 \u2212 (uX *uX )\u03b5 u \u2192 0 strong in L1 as \u03b5 \u2192 0,\nfor X = L, T. We leave that to the reader.\nFinally we see that the the lefthand side of equation (2.17) converges as \u03b5 \u2192 0 to the\nquantity\n4\n3\n\n\u001a\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\u001b\n1\n1\n\u2202t ( |u|2 ) + \u2207* ( |u|2 + p)u\n2\n2\n\nin the sense of distributions, and that the lefthand side of (2.18) converges to\n\n8\n3\n\ntimes the same\n\nquantity in the curly brackets, also in the distribution sense. However, by the result of DuchonRobert [1], that quantity in the brackets is equal to minus the defect distribution D(u). We\nconclude then that\n\u03b5\nDX\n(u) \u2192 D(u)\n\n(2.27)\n\nas \u03b5 \u2192 0 for both X = L, T , in the sense of distributions. \u2737\nWe now prove the following:\nCorollary 1 Assume that the functions SL (u, l), ST (u, l) \u2208 L1 ([0, T ] \u00d7 T3 ) defined by\n1\nSL (u, l) =\nl\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c9(l\u0302)[\u03b4uL (l)]3\n\n(2.28)\n\nd\u03c9(l\u0302)\u03b4uL (l)|\u03b4uT (l)|2\n\n(2.29)\n\nSX (u) = D\u2212 lim SX (u, l), X = L, T.\n\n(2.30)\n\n4\n8\nSL (u) = \u2212 D(u), ST (u) = \u2212 D(u).\n5\n15\n\n(2.31)\n\nS2\n\nand\n1\nST (u, l) =\nl\n\nZ\n\nS2\n\nhave limits\nl\u21920\n\nThen,\n\nThe proof is quite straightforward. An easy computation for a spherically symmetric test\nfunction gives\n4 \u03b5\nD (u) = 4\u03c0\n3 L\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\ndl l3 \u03c6\u2032 (l)SL (u, \u03b5l) + 2l2 \u03c6(l)ST (u, \u03b5l)\n9\n\n(2.32)\n\n\fand\n8 \u03b5\nD (u) = 4\u03c0\n3 T\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n0\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\ndl l3 \u03c6\u2032 (l) \u2212 2l2 \u03c6(l) ST (u, \u03b5l).\n\n(2.33)\n\nTaking the limit as \u03b5 \u2192 0, using Theorem 1, the normalization of the test function, and the\nabove hypotheses, we see that\n4\nD(u) = \u22123SL (u) + 2ST (u)\n3\n\n(2.34)\n\n8\nD(u) = \u22125ST (u).\n3\n\n(2.35)\n\nand\n\nSolving this linear system gives the result. \u2737\nIn the definition of ST (u, l) in (2.29) we could instead have replaced |\u03b4uT |2 by the square\nmagnitude of a transverse component \u03b4uT = t\u0302*\u03b4u, where t\u0302 is any unit vector perpendicular to l\u0302.\nCall such a quantity S\u0303T (u, l). However, |\u03b4uT |2 = |\u03b4uT |2 + |\u03b4u\u2032T |2 , where \u03b4u\u2032T = (t\u0302\u00d7l\u0302)*\u03b4u. Since\nboth transverse components give an equal contribution in the spherical average, ST (u, l) =\n2S\u0303T (u, l). Under the assumptions of the corollary, S\u0303T (u, l) then also has a limit distribution\nS\u0303T (u) as l \u2192 0, and\n4\nD(u).\n15\n\nS\u0303T (u) = \u2212\n\n(2.36)\n\nThis is the conventional statement of the \"4/15-law\".\n\n3\n\nDiscussion\n\nIf we couple our Corollary 1 with Duchon-Robert's characterization of D(u) by the inviscid\nlimit, [1], Proposition 4, then we arrive at essentially the following statement: For any \"nice\"\nspacetime region R \u2282 T3 \u00d7 [0, T ], let\n1\n\u03b5R = lim\n\u03bd\u21920 |R|\n\nZ Z\n\nd3 x dt \u03b5(x, t)\n\n(3.1)\n\nR\n\nwith \u03b5(x, t) := \u03bd|\u2207u\u03bd |2 (assuming for simplicity that D(u\u03bd ) = 0). If first \u03bd \u2192 0 and next\nl \u2192 0, then\n4\nh[\u03b4uL (l)]3 iang,R \u223c \u2212 \u03b5R l\n5\n10\n\n(3.2)\n\n\fwith h*iang,R denoting an average of (l\u0302, x, t) over S 2 \u00d7 R. To be precise, the relation should\nhold in the sense of averaging in x, t against smooth test functions \u03c8(x, t) rather than against\na characteristic function 1R (x, t). The latter sense is stronger, because, if the result holds for\ncharacteristic functions of Borel sets R, then, by approximation arguments, it holds also for\nsmooth functions. In fact, by the portmanteau theorem [7], it is enough to show that it holds for\nall bounded Borel sets R such that D(\u2202R) = 0, i.e. with no energy dissipation concentrating on\nthe boundary. We see from these remarks that the meaning of the Corollary 1 is that the scaling\nobserved in the Kolmogorov \"4/5-law\" [5] should hold with just local averaging in spacetime\nand an angular average over the direction of the separation vector. Note that, if the solution\nof the Navier-Stokes equations at finite viscosity is not regular, then the same relation would\nhold with the modified definition \u03b5(x, t) := \u03bd|\u2207u\u03bd |2 + D(u\u03bd ), including the dissipation from\nthe singularities.\nAnother recent work by Nie and Tanveer [6] has given a rigorous derivation of both the 4/5and 4/3-laws under conditions similar to those of Duchon-Robert and of the present paper.\nThe proof of those laws by Nie and Tanveer is for individual solutions of the Navier-Stokes\nequations (assumed to be strong) without any statistical averaging, and with no assumptions\nof homogeneity or isotropy. In [6], as here, the averaging is over spacetime and over directions\nof the separation vector. However, Nie and Tanveer considered the space average over the\nentire domain and time average over an interval [0, T ] with T \u2192 \u221e. In contrast, the present\nresult holds for any spacetime domain, of arbitrary extent, so long as the Reynolds number is\nsufficiently high, and also for solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations that may be singular.\nIn this respect, our result is stronger than that of [6]. On the other hand, our proof and that\nin [1] give no indication how large the Reynolds number must be taken to approach the limit,\nwhereas Nie and Tanveer establish precise error bounds for their result.\nThere is a slight resemblance of our and Duchon-Robert's local results with the \"refined\nsimilarity hypothesis\"that Kolmogorov postulated in 1962 [8]. Kolmogorov considered averages\n\u03b5B of dissipation over balls B \u2282 T3 and the structure functions obtained by averaging velocity\n11\n\n\fincrements \u03b4u(x, t; l) conditioned upon the local dissipation averaged over a ball Bl (x) of\ndiameter l centered at the midpoint 21 (x + l). He postulated that these might be calculated by\nhis original 1941 theory, e.g. for longitudinal differences. Hence, he obtained for unconditioned\nensemble averages\nh[\u03b4uL (l)]3n i \u223c Cn h\u03b5nBl iln\n\n(3.3)\n\nOur scaling relation (3.2) is supposed to hold pathwise, for individual realizations. Hence, if it\nholds-along with a uniform and integrable bound for l \u2192 0- then one can infer that\n\u0002\n\u0003n\nh h(\u03b4uL (l))3 iang,R i \u223c\n\n\u0012\n\n4\n\u2212\n3\n\n\u0013n\n\nh\u03b5nR iln .\n\n(3.4)\n\nThe similarity is apparent. Aside from the fact that we must integrate over time as well as\nspace, the major and significant difference is that in the relation (3.4) the region R must be\nfixed as l \u2192 0, while in Kolmogorov's hypothesis the ball Bl itself shrinks to zero in the limit.\nOur results and that of Duchon-Robert say nothing about intermittency.\nAlthough we have proved a rigorous theorem, it is only established under various hypotheses. We regard those as plausible, but it is nevertheless of some interest to inquire about the\nfeasibility of numerical and/or experimental tests of the local results proved here and in [1]. In\n[9], the 4/5-law has been verified both in a numerical simulation via a space-average over the\ndomain and also in experimental hot-wire data. However, in the same simulation, the 4/15-law\nis not satisfied (S. Chen, private communication). Similar violations of the 4/15-law were observed in experimental X-wire data from an atmospheric boundary layer [10]. In both cases,\nanisotropy of the flow may be suspected of vitiating the result. In that case, angle-averaging\nas employed in the rigorous theorems may improve the agreement. On the other hand, a more\nrecent numerical study [11] with a 10243 simulation has found that the regimes of validity of\nboth the 4/5- and 4/3-laws, in even their global form, are established only very slowly as the\nReynolds number is increased. Such a slow approach to asymptotia makes a direct test of the\nlocal results, especially a verification of the numerical prefactor, rather more difficult.\n\n12\n\n\fAcknowledgements: This work, LAUR 02-4761, was carried out in part at the Los Alamos\nNational Laboratory under the auspices of the Department of Energy and supported by ldrd-er\n2000047.
