We present preliminary results of a wide field study of the globular cluster\nsystem of NGC 4594, the Sombrero galaxy. The galaxy was observed in B, V , and\nR using the Wide Field Imager on the ESO 2.2m telescope. Using color and shape\ncriteria to select a sample of highly probable globular cluster candidates, we measured\nthe radial density profile of clusters out to 40\u2032 (100 Kpc) in the galaxy halo. The colors\nare consistent with the bimodal color distribution observed in previous studies. The\nred cluster candidates show a clear central concentration relative to the blue clusters.\nThe population of red clusters does not appear significantly flattened, thus indicating\nthat they are associated to the galaxy bulge rather than to the disk.\n\n1\n\nObservations and reduction\n\nWide field imaging of M 104 was taken in April 2000 using the ESO/MPG 2.2m\ntelescope at La Silla. The typical exposure time was 35 min in each of the B, V ,\nand R bands. Pre-reduction was performed using the IRAF package MSCRED,\nwhile distortion correction, image alignment onto a common sky reference system, co-adding and mosaicing were obtained using a dedicated IRAF package\n(Rizzi & Held 2002, in prep.). The combined images in each passband were then\nsuitably processed to subtract the galaxy's diffuse light. The ring median filtering in IRAF was used to this purpose. Finally, DAOPHOT aperture photometry\nwas obtained on the sum images, and a catalog was built of objects detected in\nall passbands at the 4\u03c3 level. From this master catalog, a sample of candidate\nglobular clusters was selected based on the object color and shape. As a simple shape parameter we used the difference between two aperture magnitudes\nwith different radii of 2 and 4 pixels (the typical size of stellar images being 4-5\npixels FWHM). This simple method proved to be quite effective in discriminating star-like images from diffuse objects (i.e. background galaxies) (Fig. 1, right\npanel).\nThe color-magnitude diagram of star-like objects around M 104 clearly shows\nthe presence of a conspicuous globular cluster population (see Fig. 1, left panel).\nThe color and magnitude selection outlined in Fig. 1 was used to define our final\nsample of high-probability globular cluster candidates. The adopted limits were\nmodeled on the properties of globular clusters in M 31 [1]. Using this combined\n\n\f2\n\nAlessia Moretti et al.\n\nFig. 1.

The rectangle indicates our selection of\nthe most probable candidates. Right: the concentration parameter used to discriminate\npoint-like from diffuse objects. Star-like objects are the sequence between the two\nhorizontal lines.\n\ncolor and shape selection, contamination by foreground stars and background\ngalaxies in expected to be very low.\n\n2\n\nSpatial distribution\n\nWide field CCD imaging provides the possibility of detecting bona-fide globular\nclusters out to large distances from the galaxy center. Figure 2 shows the surface\ndensity profile of candidates within 15\u2032 (nearly 40 Kpc at the distance of M 104)\nfrom the galaxy center. We have used the outer regions (beyond 16.5 arcmin from\nthe center) to estimate and statistically subtract an approximate background\nlevel. The cluster distribution appears to be more extended than the galaxy\nlight, confirming the result of the photographic study of W. Harris and coll. [4].\nThere is also a hint of flattening in the inner region, which is consistent with a\ntwo-slopes fit [2].\n\n3\n\nColors and metallicities\n\nThe sample of bona-fide candidates was also used to derive the color distribution of globular clusters in the halo of the Sombrero galaxy. Figure 3 suggests\na bimodal metallicity distribution, with peaks at B \u2212 R = 1.15 and 1.35, corresponding to [Fe/H]= \u22121.4 and \u22120.6 by adopting the transformation of [1].\nThe metallicities measured from colors and spectroscopy ([6]; Held et al., this\nvolume) are in good agreement. These results agree with those derived by Larsen\n\n\fWide field photometry of the M104 globular cluster system\n\n3\n\nFig. 2. The radial density profile of bona-fide globular cluster candidates in M 104. A\nlinear fit to the density profile between 2.5 and 12.5 arcmin is also shown, yielding a\npower-law exponent \u22121.92.\n\nand coll. [5] from the V \u2212I colors of an HST inner cluster sample. These metallicities are very similar to those of globular clusters in our Galaxy and M 31, where\nthe blue component is associated to a cluster sub-population which is old and\nmetal-poor, while the red component is metal-rich and typical of the bulge/disc\npopulation [3].\n\n4\n\nRadial gradients\n\nThe red clusters turn out to be more centrally concentrated than the blue ones,\nwhich confirms their association with the galaxy bulge [5]. The right panel of\nFig. 3 shows the radial distribution of the two sub-populations. Moving to the\nouter regions the blue, presumably metal-poor, component becomes predominant, and a ratio between red and blue clusters typical of spiral galaxies is\nreached. Interestingly, the projected two-dimensional distributions of both the\n\n\f4\n\nAlessia Moretti et al.\n\nFig. 3.
