Introduction\nLet K be a knot in the 3-sphere S 3 . Suppose K is the connected sum of two nontrivial knots K1 and K2 . Then we say that K is a composite knot, and denote it by\nK = K1 #K2 . Otherwise we say that K is a prime knot.\nLet p, q, r, s be integers such that p > r > 1, q > 0, gcd(p, q) = 1 and let T (p, q)\nbe the torus knot of type (p, q) in S 3 . For the definition of torus knots T (p, q) we\nrefer to [7]. Add s times full twists on mutually parallel r strands in T (p, q). Then\naccording as [1], we call the knot obtained by this operation a twisted torus knot of\ntype (p, q; r, s) and denote it by T (p, q; r, s) as illustrated in Figure 1.\n\nT(p, q ; r, s)\n\ns-times\nfull twists\non\nr-strands\n\n(p, q)torus braid\n\nFigure 1\n\n1\n\n\fTwisted torus knots are deeply related to unexpected Dehn surgeries. In fact,\nthe famous hyperbolic pretzel knot P (\u22122, 3, 7) found by Fintushel\u2013Stern in [2] is the\ntwisted torus knot T (5, 3; 2, 1). In addition, many similar hyperbolic twisted torus\nknots have been found in [1]. Moreover, twisted torus knots have interesting properties\nin the additivity of tunnel numbers of knots as in [4]. Therefore, the family of twisted\ntorus knots has been considered as an important class in studying of knot theory.\nBy a little observation, we see that T (p, q; 2, s) has tunnel number one for any\nchoice of p, q, s, and is prime by [6]. Moreover, J. H. Lee has recently shown in [3]\nthat T (p, q; 3, s) has also tunnel number one for any choice of p, q, s, and is prime by\n[6] again. In fact, so far, no composite twisted torus knot has been known. Therefore,\nwe need to ask if there are composite twisted torus knots. In the present note, we\nwill answer to this question as follows :\nTheorem 1. Suppose p = (a + 1)(k1 + k2 ) + 1, q = a(k1 + k2 ) + 1, r = p \u2212 k1 and\ns = \u22121 for some integers a > 0, k1 > 1 and k2 > 1. Then T (p, q; r, s) is the connected\nsum of T (k1 , ak1 + 1) and T (k2 , \u2212(a + 1)k2 \u2212 1).\nExamples. (1) Put a = 1, k1 = k2 = 2, then p = 9, q = 5, r = 7 and T (9, 5; 7, \u22121) \u223c\n=\nT (2, 3)#T (2, \u22125).\n(2) Put a = 2, k1 = 4, k2 = 2, then p = 19, q = 13, r = 15 and T (19, 13; 15, \u22121) \u223c\n=\nT (4, 9)#T (2, \u22127).\nBy the way, it is well known that composite knots have essential tori in the exteriors.\nConcerning the conditin for twisted torus knots to have essential tori in the exteriors,\nwe have shown in [5] that for any composite number r = km (k > 1, m > 1), there\nare infinitely many twisted torus knots T (p, q; r, s) which have essential tori in the\nexteriors. Moreover, we have shown that those knots are cable knots along some\ntorus knots, and are prime. Therefore, by these results, we need to consider the\nfollowing problem :\nProblems.\n\n(1) Characterize the knot types of composite twisted torus knots. In\n\nparticular, we conjecture that the condition in Theorem 1 is also a necessary condition\nfor twisted torus knots to be composite knots.\n(2) Characterize the knot types of prime twisted torus knots with essential tori.\n2. Proof of Theorem 1\nLet K = T (p, q; r, s) be the knot as in Theorem 1, i.e., p = (a + 1)(k1 + k2 ) + 1,\nq = a(k1 + k2 ) + 1, r = p \u2212 k1 and s = \u22121 for some integers a > 0, k1 > 1 and k2 > 1.\nThen we can regard p, q, r as follows :\np = (a + 1)(k1 + k2 ) + 1 = k1 + k2 + k1 + k2 + * * * + k1 + (k2 + 1),\n\n2\n\n\fq = a(k1 + k2 ) + 1 = k1 + k2 + * * * + k1 + (k2 + 1),\nr = p \u2212 k1 = k1 + k2 + k1 + * * * + k2 + (k2 + 1).\nThen we can divide p strings into a + 1 bunchs of k1 strings, a bunchs of k2 strings\nand one bunch of k2 + 1 strings, can divide q strings into a bunchs of k1 strings, a \u2212 1\nbunchs of k2 strings and one bunch of k2 + 1 strings and can divide r strings into a\nbunchs of k2 strings, a bunchs of k1 strings and one bunch of k2 +1 strings as in Figure\n2, where Figure 2 is the case of a = 2, k1 = 4, k2 = 2, i.e., K = T (19, 13; 15, \u22121).\nFirst, deform the first bunch of k1 strings in the p strings as in Figure 3(1), and\nthen deform the second bunch, the third bunch, * * *, the ath bunch of k1 strings, and\nfinally decompose the knot T (p, q; r, s) into two knots at the place indicated in Figure\n3(2).\nNext, take the knot which consists of k1 strings from the two knots obtained in\nFigure 3(2) as in Figure 4(1). Then we can see that the knot in Figure 4(1) is a torus\n2\u03c0\nrotation as in Figure\nknot which consists of k1 strings with a times full twists and\nk1\n4(2). Thus we see that the knot is the torus knot of type (k1 , ak1 + 1).\nFinally, take the other knot in Figure 3(2). Then we can see that the knot in Figure\n2\u03c0\n* (\u2212k2 )\n5(1) is a torus knot which consists of (a + 1)k2 + 1 strings with\n(a + 1)k2 + 1\nrotation as in Figure 5(2) because ak2 + 1 \u2212 ((a + 1)k2 + 1) = \u2212k2 . Thus we see\nthat the knot is the torus knot of type ((a + 1)k2 + 1, \u2212k2 ). In addition, this knot\nis the same knot as the torus knot of type (k2 , \u2212(a + 1)k2 \u2212 1). This completes\nthe proof of Theorem1. In the case of Figure 2, we have K = T (19, 13; 15, \u22121) =\nT (4, 9)#T (7, \u22122) = T (4, 9)#T (2, \u22127).\n\nk 2+1\nk1\nk2\n\nk 2+1\n\nk 2+1\n\nk1\n\nk1\n\nk2\n\nk2\n\nFigure 2\n\n3\n\n\fdecompose here\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nFigure 3\n\nk1\n\na times\nfull twists\n\n+1\n\n(2)\n\n(1)\n\nFigure 4\n\n4\n\n\f(a+1)k 2+1\n\n-((a+1)k 2 +1)\n\nak 2 +1\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nFigure 5\nReferences\n[1] P.
