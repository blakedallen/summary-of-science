On one hand, mu and md are\nmuch smaller than any intrinsic QCD scale, and their non-zero values induce only\nsmall corrections to the SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) chiral limit, in which mu = md = 0. A\nsystematic expansion in mu and md , keeping all remaining quark masses at their\nphysical values, defines the two-flavour Chiral Perturbation Theory (\u03c7PT) [1]. On the\nother hand, the mass ms of the strange quark is considerably higher (see e.g., Ref. [2]\nand references therein for recent determinations); indeed, it is nearly of the order of\n\u039bQCD , the characteristic scale describing the running of the QCD effective coupling.\nNevertheless, a slowly convergent SU(3) \u00d7 SU(3) chiral expansion is conceivable [3].\nThis is suggested from a comparison of the kaon mass MK with the mass scale\n\u039bH \u223c 1 GeV of (strange) QCD bound states not protected by chiral symmetry:\nMK2 /\u039b2H \u223c 0.25 \u2212 0.30. Due to the rather specific value of ms , the strange quark\nplays a special role among all six quarks:\ni) ms is small enough to be used as an expansion parameter (at least in some\nrestricted sense) and to relate properties of QCD vacuum in the SU(3)\u00d7SU(3)\nchiral symmetry limit mu = md = ms = 0 to observable quantities.\nii) Unlike mu , md , the strange quark mass is sufficiently large, ms \u223c \u039bQCD , to\ninfluence the magnitude of order parameters characteristic of the SU(2)\u00d7SU(2)\nchiral limit mu , md = 0 with ms fixed at its physical value.\niii) At the same time, ms is not large enough to suppress loop effects of massive s\u0304s\nvacuum pairs. This is to be contrasted with heavy quarks Q = c, b, t for which\nmQ \u226b \u039bQCD and the effect of Q\u0304Q pairs on the vacuum structure is expected\nto be tiny.\nThe above remarks single out the role of massive strange sea quarks, and suggest\na possibly different behaviour for Nf = 2 and Nf = 3 chiral dynamics. The origin of\nthis difference clearly appears in connection with the possibility that in the vacuum\nchannel (J P C = 0++ ) the Zweig rule and the 1/Nc expansion break down. This is\nstrongly suggested by scalar meson spectroscopy [4], sum rule studies [5, 6, 7, 8], as\nwell as by instanton-inspired models [9]1 . Furthermore, the enhancement of Zweigrule violating effects of s\u0304s pairs on chiral order parameters has a natural theoretical\ninterpretation as a consequence of fluctuations of the lowest eigenvalues of Euclidean\nQCD Dirac operator, in particular of their density [10]. These fluctuations would only\naffect quantities dominated by the infrared end of the Dirac spectrum [11]; however,\nthis is precisely the case of chiral order parameters such as the quark condensate\nand the pion decay constant. (Most of observables not protected by chiral symmetry\n1\n\nIt should also be visible in fully unquenched lattice simulations.\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fare not especially sensitive to small Dirac eigenvalues and they have no particular\nreason to break the Zweig rule or the 1/Nc expansion.) Fluctuations of small Dirac\neigenvalues lead to a large long-range correlation between 0+ massive s\u0304s and massless\n \u0304 pairs. This correlation enhances the SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) order parameters\n\u016bu + dd\n\u03a3(2) = \u2212\nF (2)2 =\n\nlim h\u016bui|ms=physical\nmu ,md \u21920\nlim F\u03c02 |ms =physical\nmu ,md \u21920\n\n(1.1)\n(1.2)\n\nby a contribution which is induced from vacuum s\u0304s pairs. The \"induced condensate\"\nand \"induced decay constant\" [11, 12] are proportional to ms and vanish in the\nSU(3) \u00d7 SU(3) chiral limit mu = md = ms = 0. As a result the Nf = 3 condensate\n\u03a3(3) and the decay constant F (3)2 can be substantially suppressed compared to the\ncorresponding two-flavour order parameters,\n\u03a3(2) > \u03a3(3) = \u03a3(2)|ms =0\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\nF (2) > F (3) = F (2) |ms =0 .\n\n(1.3)\n(1.4)\n\nThe existence of this paramagnetic effect and its sign can be expected on general\ntheoretical grounds [11], but its magnitude depends on the size of fluctuations of small\nDirac eigenvalues, which is hard to infer from first principles. A general discussion\nof the interplay between chiral order and fluctuations in the QCD vacuum can be\nfound in Ref. [13].\nThe main question to be asked is how can the effect of vacuum fluctuations on\nchiral symmetry breaking be detected experimentally. Recall that two-flavour order\nparameters are most easily accessible via low-energy \u03c0\u03c0 scattering. Using accurate\nrecent data [14], we have inferred values for the Nf = 2 condensate and decay\nconstant; expressed in suitable physical units, we found [15]\n(mu + md )\u03a3(2)\n= 0.81 \u00b1 0.07\nF\u03c02 M\u03c02\nF (2)2\n= 0.89 \u00b1 0.03 .\nZ(2) =\nF\u03c02\n\nX(2) =\n\n(1.5)\n(1.6)\n\nThe fact that both X(2) and Z(2) are rather close to one indicates that, as long as\nms is kept at its physical value, the effect of nonzero mu , md is indeed small. This\nin turn suggests that the standard two-flavour \u03c7PT is a well-behaved expansion [1];\nits leading order, described by the decay constant F 2 \u2261 F (2)2 and by the Nf = 2\nquark condensate \u03a3(2) \u2261 F 2 B, is dominant. On the other hand, the three-flavour\norder parameters \u03a3(3) and F (3)2 are more difficult to pin down, since they require\nan extrapolation to ms = 0. The latter necessitates the use of three-flavor \u03c7PT,\nincluding more observables such as the masses and decay constants of the whole\noctet of Goldstone bosons, the K \u2212 \u03c0 form factors, K \u2212 \u03c0 scattering amplitude, etc.\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fThe Nf = 3 \u03c7PT involves more low-energy constants starting in order O(p4), and\nhigher orders are likely to be more important than in the two-flavour case. Most\nexisting analyses [3, 16, 17, 18] are based on an explicit assumption that the effect of\nvacuum fluctuations of s\u0304s pairs on order parameters is small: it is usually assumed\nthat the two parameters of the O(p2 ) Lagrangian F0 \u2261 F (3) and \u03a3(3) \u2261 F02 B0 are\nsuch that F0 \u2248 F\u03c0 and (mu + md )\u03a3(3) \u2248 F\u03c02 M\u03c02 , i.e., that the corrections due to\nnonvanishing ms can be treated as a small perturbation.\nA closely related assumption concerns the smallness of the two O(p4) LEC's\nLr6 (\u03bc) and Lr4 (\u03bc) which describe the large-Nc suppressed and Zweig-rule violating\neffects of fluctuations in the vacuum channel. Experimental information on the actual\nsize of these two constants has been rather scarce; for long time it was customary to\nposit Lr6 (M\u03c1 ) = (\u22120.2 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 10\u22123 and Lr4 (M\u03c1 ) = (\u22120.3 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10\u22123 as an input to\nboth one-loop [3, 16] and two-loop calculations [17, 18]. More recently, attempts of\nindirect estimates of L4 and L6 have appeared, all pointing towards a small positive\nvalues compared to the old Zweig-rule based estimates mentioned above. Rapidly\nconvergent sum rules for the correlator h(\u016bu)(s\u0304s)i [5, 6, 7, 8] yield a rough estimate\nLr6 (M\u03c1 ) = (0.6 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 10\u22123 , while from the analysis of \u03c0 \u2212 K sum-rules [19] it has\nbeen concluded that Lr4 (M\u03c1 ) = (0.2 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 10\u22123 . The last conclusion has been\nconfirmed in a recent two-loop fit to the scalar form-factors [20]. The point is that\nthe effect of such small shifts on order parameters is amplified by large coefficients:\nwith the above estimates, \u03a3(3) and F (3)2 can be suppressed compared to \u03a3(2) and\nF (2)2 respectively by as much as a factor of 2. In this way, vacuum fluctuations of\ns\u0304s pairs could lead to a particular type of instability in three-flavour \u03c7PT.\nThe main purpose of the present work is to investigate instabilities in Nf = 3\n\u03c7PT that would specifically arise from the (partial) suppression of order parameters\n\u03a3(3) and F02 , and to propose a systematic nonperturbative modification (resummation) of the standard \u03c7PT recipe that could solve the problem. We assume that\nthe whole expansion of relevant observables in powers of ms is globally \u2013 though\nslowly and at most asymptotically \u2013 convergent. The problem may occur with the\nenhancement of particular terms of the type ms L6 or ms L4 that appear with large coefficients and can be identified as arising from fluctuation of vacuum s\u0304s pairs. These\nterms are responsible for the important \"induced contributions\" to \u03a3(2) and F (2)2 ,\nexplaining why \u03a3(2) and F (2)2 at physical ms could be substantially larger than\ntheir ms = 0 limit \u03a3(3) and F (3)2 respectively. We show that in order to solve this\nparticular problem it is not necessary to modify the standard chiral counting rules\nas in generalized \u03c7PT [21]. The modification we propose is more modest: within\nthe standard expansion scheme in powers of quark masses and external momenta,\nit appears sufficient to resum the fluctuation terms driven by ms L4 and ms L6 in\nthe usual perturbative reexpression of order parameters ms \u03a3(3) and F02 in terms of\nobservables such as M\u03c0 , MK , . . . and physical decay constants. This resummation is\nof importance for the purpose of extracting the value of Nf = 3 order parameters\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\ffrom experiment.\nThe possible effects of vacuum fluctuations in three-flavour \u03c7PT and their resummation are discussed in Sections 2 and 3. These two sections are focused on\nGoldstone boson masses and decay constants, which are the observables directly entering the reexpression of order parameters m\u03a3(3) and F02 . In our approach, the\ninfluence of higher \u03c7PT orders (O(p6 ) and higher) is encoded into a few parameters referred to as \"NNLO remainders\", which are kept through the whole analysis\nwhatever their values. The latter depend on the model one takes for the higher order counterterms and one hopes they remain reasonably small independently of the\nmodel used. The result of this part of our article is an exact expression of L4 , L5 , L6\nand L8 in terms of three fundamental parameters\nX(3) =\n\n(mu + md )\u03a3(3)\n,\nF\u03c02 M\u03c02\n\nZ(3) =\n\nF02\n,\nF\u03c02\n\nr=\n\n2ms\n,\nmu + md\n\n(1.7)\n\nand four NNLO remainders. Using these expressions inside the \u03c7PT formulae for\nvarious additional observables, one can hope to pin down the values of X(3), Z(3) and\nr for a given set of assumptions about higher orders (NNLO remainders). The logical\nstructure of the problem naturally calls for a Bayesian statistical type approach [22].\nAs a first application we consider the three-flavour analysis of \u03c0\u03c0 scattering, since\ntoday rather accurate data exist in this case and we know from past studies [11, 13]\nthat a strong correlation exists between the value of r and the characteristics of\nthe two-flavour chiral limit as revealed in low-energy \u03c0\u03c0 scattering. In Section 4\na quantitative analysis of this correlation is presented for the first time. On the\nother hand, the Nf = 3 order parameters X(3) and Z(3) cannot be extracted from\nthe \u03c0\u03c0 data alone. In Section 5 we survey some possibilities of learning about\nthese fundamental order parameters from \u03c0 \u2212 K scattering, \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 decays, OPE\ncondensates and sum rules and, last but not least, from lattice simulations with three\nfully dynamical fermions: we present the corresponding extrapolation formulae using\nour resummed \u03c7PT formulation.\n\n2. Convergence and instabilities of Nf = 3 chiral expansion\nWe first recall the general structure of three-flavour \u03c7PT [3], emphasising where and\nhow the instabilities due to vacuum fluctuations of s\u0304s pairs [11] could possibly show\nup. Unless stated otherwise, a typical quantity subject to the expansion in powers\nof running quark masses mu , md , ms will be thought of as a connected QCD correlation function of quark currents (V, A, S, P ) with external momenta fixed somewhere\nin a low-energy region away from the singularities generated by Goldstone bosons.\nWe will take as a working hypothesis that the usual low-energy observables, e.g.,\nGoldstone boson masses, decay constants, form factors and scattering amplitudes\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\f(at particular kinematical points), when linearly expressed through such QCD correlation functions exhibit optimal convergence properties. While a similar assumption\nis implicitly made in the standard off-shell formulation of \u03c7PT [1, 3], we will shortly\nargue that in the presence of important vacuum fluctuations this assumption should\nbe understood as a restriction: observables that are not linearly expressible in terms\nof QCD correlators, e.g., ratios of Goldstone boson masses, need not admit a well\nconvergent perturbative treatment and they should be treated with a particular\ncare. This selects for instance F\u03c02 M\u03c02 , F\u03c02 and F\u03c02 FK2 A\u03c0K (where A\u03c0K denotes the\n\u03c0K-scattering amplitude), but rules out M\u03c02 .\n2.1 The bare \u03c7PT series\nThe chiral expansion of symmetry-breaking observables in terms of the three lightest\nquark masses mu , md , ms is actually not a genuine power series expansion, due to\nthe presence of chiral logarithms, which reflect infrared singularities characteristic\nof the chiral limit. One can nevertheless give an unambiguous scale-independent\nmeaning to the renormalized coefficients of each power of individual quark masses.\nAn observable A can be represented as a formal series\nX\nr\nA=\nmju mkd mls Ajkl [mu , md , ms ; B0 , F0 ; Lr1 (\u03bc) . . . Lr10 (\u03bc); C1r (\u03bc) . . . C90\n(\u03bc); . . .],\nj,k,l\n\n(2.1)\nwhere the coefficients Ajkl are defined in terms of the constants contained in the\neffective Lagrangian: i) The basic order parameters B0 and F0 which are related to\nthe three-flavour chiral limit of the quark condensate and of the pion decay constant\nrespectively,\n\u03a3(3) = \u2212\n\nlim\n\nh\u016bui ,\n\nmu ,md ,ms \u21920\n\nF0 \u2261 F (3) =\n\nlim\n\nmu ,md ,ms \u21920\n\nF\u03c0 ,\n\nB0 =\n\n\u03a3(3)\n; (2.2)\nF (3)2\n\nii) the 10 O(p4 ) LEC's Lri (\u03bc), iii) the 90 O(p6) LEC's Cir (\u03bc) [23], and eventually\nhigher-order counterterms. All LEC's are renormalized at the scale \u03bc. In addition,\nthe Ajkl depend logarithmically on the quark masses through the Goldstone boson\nmasses in the loops, and this dependence is such that for each jkl the coefficient Ajkl\nis independent of the scale \u03bc. The representation (2.1) has been explicitly worked\nout for some observables to one [3] and two loops [17, 18, 20] and there is no doubt\nthat it extends to all orders of the chiral expansion. We shall refer to the expansion\nexpressed in the form (2.1) as a bare expansion, to emphasize that it is entirely\nwritten in terms of the parameters of the effective Lagrangian \u2013 no reexpression of\nthe latter in terms of observable quantities has been performed. It is crucial that\neven before one starts rewriting and reordering the series (2.1) in powers of Goldstone\nboson masses, the full renormalisation of the bare expansion (2.1) can be performed\norder by order in quark masses. Consequently, the coefficients Ajkl are finite as well\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fas cut-off and renormalisation scale-independent for all values of quark masses and\nof (renormalized) LEC's in the effective Lagrangian.\nIn view of possible applications, we are concerned with practical questions related\nto the convergence properties of the bare \u03c7PT expansion (2.1) in QCD. The latter\nwill depend on the values of running quark masses and on the values of the LEC's at\nthe typical hadronic scale \u039bH \u223c M\u03c1 set by the masses of non-Goldstone hadrons. In\nparticular, one should question the convergence of the bare chiral expansion for the\nactual values of quark masses and not just in the infinitesimal vicinity of the chiral\nlimit. In the real world, all three quarks uds are sufficiently light,\nmu (\u039bH ), md (\u039bH ) \u226a ms (\u039bH ) \u226a \u039bH ,\n\n(2.3)\n\nto expect a priori some (at least asymptotic) convergence of the three-flavour bare\n\u03c7PT series. As pointed out in Refs. [7, 11], instabilities of the latter can nevertheless\noccur due to fluctuations of massive s\u0304s pairs in the vacuum. The importance of such\npairs is measured by the strength of the effective QCD coupling; i.e., comparing ms\nwith \u039bQCD , rather than with the hadronic scale \u039bH . Furthermore, the impact of\nthese fluctuations is proportional to ms . Hence, instabilities due to fluctuations of\nvacuum quark-antiquark pairs turn out to be particularly relevant for strange quarks\nand could manifest themselves when two- and three-flavour chiral expansions are\ncompared.\nIt has been argued [7, 11] that fluctuations of s\u0304s pairs lead to a partial suppression\nof the three-flavour condensate \u03a3(3), reducing the relative importance of the first\nterm in the bare expansion of the Goldstone boson masses. We can consider for\ninstance the Ward identity related to the mass of the pion (from now on we neglect\nisospin breaking and take mu = md = m):\nF\u03c02 M\u03c02 = 2m\u03a3(3) + 2mms Z s\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\nM\u03b72\nMK2\nB02\ns\n2\n3 log 2 + log 2\n+ F\u03c02 M\u03c02 d\u03c0 .\n+4m A + Z +\n2\n32\u03c0\nM\u03c0\nMK\n\n(2.4)\n\nThe parameters Z s and A are defined in terms of the LEC's L6 (\u03bc), L8 (\u03bc) and logarithms of Goldstone boson masses (their expression is recalled in App. A). Vacuum fluctuations of s\u0304s-pairs show up in the term ms Z s . For the physical value of\nms \u223c \u039bQCD , the corresponding O(p4 ) term 2mms Z s can be as important [5, 7, 8]\nas the leading-order condensate term 2m\u03a3(3). Even then, the remainder d\u03c0 , which\ncollects all O(p6 ) and higher contributions, can still be small: d\u03c0 \u226a 1. In other\nwords, vacuum fluctuations need not affect the overall convergence of the bare chiral expansions such as (2.1) or (2.4) at least for some well-defined selected class of\nobservables.\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\f2.2 The role of NNLO remainders\nLet us write a generic bare expansion (2.1) in a concise form\nA = ALO + ANLO + A \u03b4A.\n\n(2.5)\n\nEq. (2.5) is an identity: ALO collects leading powers in quark masses in the bare\nexpansion (2.1) (e.g., the condensate term in Eq. (2.4)), ANLO consists of all next-toleading contributions (the second and third terms in Eq. (2.4)), whereas A \u03b4A stands\nfor the sum of all remaining terms starting with the next-to-next-to-leading order\n(NNLO). In Eq. (2.4), the latter is denoted as \u03b4(F\u03c02 M\u03c02 ) \u2261 d\u03c0 .\nWith this setting, A can be identified with the exact (experimental) value of the\nobservable A. Usually, ALO corresponds to the O(p2) contribution, ANLO to O(p4)\nand A \u03b4A collects all higher orders starting with O(p6 ) 2 . \u03b4A will be referred to as\n\"NNLO remainder\". A precise definition of \u03b4A involves some convention in writing\nthe argument in the chiral logarithms contained in the one-loop expression for ANLO .\nTo illustrate this point consider the typical next-to-leading expression:\n#\n\"\nX\nX PQ\nANLO =\nmq mq\u2032 aqq\u2032 (\u03bc) +\naqq\u2032 kP Q (\u03bc) ,\n(2.6)\nPQ\n\nqq \u2032\n\nor\nANLO =\n\nX\nq\n\n\"\n\nmq aq (\u03bc) +\n\nX\n\n#\n\naPq Q kP Q (\u03bc) ,\n\nPQ\n\n(2.7)\n\ncorresponding respectively to a leading-order term ALO = O(mquark ) and ALO =\nO(1). Here q, q \u2032 = (u, d, s) and P, Q label Goldstone bosons. We have introduced\nthe loop factor in the general case of unequal masses [3]:\n1 MP2 log(MP2 /\u03bc2 ) \u2212 MQ2 log(MQ2 /\u03bc2 )\n,\nkP Q (\u03bc) =\n32\u03c0 2\nMP2 \u2212 MQ2\nwhich in the limit of equal masses becomes:\n\u0014\n\u0015\nMP2\n1\nlog 2 + 1 .\nkP P (\u03bc) =\n32\u03c0 2\n\u03bc\n\n(2.8)\n\n(2.9)\n\nIn Eqs. (2.6)-(2.7), the constants aqq\u2032 (\u03bc) [aq (\u03bc)] are expressed in terms of O(p4)\nLEC's Lri (\u03bc) multiplied by the appropriate powers of B0 and F0 . These constants\nare defined in the chiral limit and are consequently independent of quark masses,\nsimilarly to the known numerical coefficients aPqqQ\u2032 [aPq Q ].\nThe only requirement from \u03c7PT is that ANLO reproduces the O(p4 ) behaviour\nin the limit of small quark masses mquark \u2192 0; i.e., when the Goldstone boson\n2\n\nThe case of a quantity whose expansion only starts at O(p4 ) or higher, requires particular care.\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fmasses MP2 in the loop factors (2.8) and (2.9) are replaced by their respective leadingorder contributions. Once this mathematical condition is satisfied, different ways of\nwriting the arguments of the chiral logarithms for physical values of quark masses\nmerely correspond to different conventions in defining the NNLO remainders \u03b4A. For\nobservables of the form of Eqs. (2.6)-(2.7) at O(p4), we will use the convention which\nconsists in writing in Eq. (2.8) the physical values of the Goldstone boson masses\nMP2 ; alternatively, we could have used the sum of LO and NLO contributions to MP2 .\nThis concerns, in particular, the expansion of the Goldstone boson masses and decay\nconstants. In the latter case one has P = Q and the convention simply amounts to\nwriting the O(p4 ) tadpoles, in the notation of Ref. [3], as\n\u03bcP =\n\nMP2 |phys.\n1 MP2 |LO\nlog\n.\n32\u03c0 2 F02\n\u03bc2\n\n(2.10)\n\nThe same rule can be applied to the unitarity corrections arising in the bare expansion\nof subtraction constants that define form factors and low-energy \u03c0\u03c0 [24] and \u03c0K [19,\n25, 26] amplitudes. Such a prescription (detailed in Sec. 4.1) will suffice for the\nquantities considered in this article.\nNot much is known about the size of NNLO remainders despite the fact that complete SU(3) \u00d7 SU(3) two-loop calculations do exist for some observables [17, 18, 20]\nand the general structure of the generating functional is known to this order [23]. Following this line, the bare expansion can be pushed further and the NNLO remainder\n\u03b4A can be represented as\nA\nA\nA \u03b4A = \u2206A\n2L (\u03bc) + \u22061L (\u03bc) + \u2206tree (\u03bc) + . . . ,\n\n(2.11)\n\nwhere the ellipsis stands for O(p8) and higher contributions. The splitting of the\nO(p6 ) part [23] into the genuine two-loop contribution \u22062L (containing only O(p2)\nvertices), the one-loop contribution \u22061L (with the insertion of a single O(p4) vertex) and the tree O(p6 ) contribution \u2206tree depends on the renormalisation scale and\nscheme.\nSeveral ingredients are actually needed to estimate \u03b4A from the representation\n(2.11). The first two terms (loop contributions) depend respectively on O(p2 ) parameters mB0 , ms B0 , F0 and on O(p4 ) LEC's Lri (\u03bc). Furthermore, the tree-level\nr\n6\ncounterterms \u2206A\ntree (\u03bc) are built up from the 90 LEC's Ci (\u03bc) that define the O(p )\neffective Lagrangian. Even if some of them can presumably be determined from\nthe momentum dependence of form factors, decay distributions and scattering amplitudes (e.g., quadratic slopes), the remaining unknown O(p6 ) constants, which\nmerely describe the higher-order dependence on quark masses, are probably much\nmore numerous than the observables that one can hope to measure experimentally.\nAt this stage some models (resonance saturation, large Nc , NJL . . . ) and/or lattice\ndeterminations are required [27], but the large number of terms contributing to a\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\fgiven \u2206A\ntree makes the resulting uncertainty in \u03b4A delicate to estimate. Finally, it is\nworth stressing that only the sum of the three components shown in Eq. (2.11) is\nmeaningful. An estimate of the size of NNLO remainders is therefore not possible\nwithout a precise knowledge of the O(p2 ) and O(p4 ) constants mB0 , F0 and the Li 's.\nIn this paper, we do not address the problem of determining NNLO remainders\non the basis of Eq. (2.11). We are going to show that interesting nonperturbative\nconclusions can be reached, even if we do not decompose NNLO remainders and\ninvestigate the behaviour of the theory as a function of their size. We are primarily\ninterested in the constraints imposed by experimental data on the fundamental QCD\nSU(3) \u00d7 SU(3) chiral order parameters (and quark mass ratio)\n2m\u03a3(3)\nF 2 (3)\n,\nZ(3)\n=\n,\nM\u03c02 F\u03c02\nF\u03c02\nX(3)\n2mB0\n=\n,\nY (3) =\n2\nM\u03c0\nZ(3)\n\nX(3) =\n\nr=\n\nms\n,\nm\n\n(2.12)\n(2.13)\n\nunder various theoretical assumptions on NNLO remainders (i.e., on higher \u03c7PT\norders). A suitable approach to this problem is provided by Bayesian statistical\ninference [22]. (See App. B for a brief review adapted to the case of \u03c7PT.) The\noutput of this analysis is presented as marginal probability distribution functions\nfor the fundamental parameters (2.12) and it depends not only on the experimental\ninput but also on the state of our knowledge of higher \u03c7PT orders. In this approach\nthe latter dependence is clearly stated and can be put under control: the analysis can\nbe gradually refined if new information on the relevant NNLO remainders becomes\navailable either through Eq. (2.11) or in another way.\nWe start with a very simple theoretical assumption about higher orders: the bare\nchiral expansion of \"good observables\" as defined at the beginning of this section, is\nglobally convergent. By these words, we mean that the NNLO remainder \u03b4A in the\nidentity (2.5) is small compared to 1:\n\u03b4A \u226a 1 ,\n\n(2.14)\n\nfor the physical values of the quark masses and for the actual size of O(p2) and O(p4)\nparameters. On general grounds, one expects \u03b4A = O(m2quark ). In the worst case, its\nsize should be \u03b4A = O(m2s ) \u223c (30%)2 = 0.1, but in many situations \u03b4A turns out\nto be O(ms m) or even O(m2 ) and is therefore more suppressed 3 . These cases are\nusually identified as a consequence of SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) low-energy theorems. (Such\nsuppressions are not claimed from arguments based on the Zweig rule, since we never\nassume the latter.) However the NNLO remainders will not be neglected or used as\nsmall expansion parameters in the following.\n3\n\nWe take as order of magnitudes 10 % for O(m) contributions and 30 % for O(ms ) terms.\nThis can be related to the typical sizes of violation for SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) and SU (3) \u00d7 SU (3) flavour\nsymmetries.\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\fOn the other hand, no particular hierarchy will be assumed between the leading\nO(p ) and next-to-leading O(p4) components of (2.5). By definition, for infinitesimally small quark masses mu , md , ms one should have\n2\n\nANLO \u226a ALO ,\n\nXA \u2261\n\nALO\n\u223c 1.\nA\n\n(2.15)\n\nHowever, due to vacuum fluctuations of q\u0304q pairs, the condition (2.15) can be easily\ninvalidated for physical value of ms \u223c \u039bQCD : as discussed in Ref. [11], the threeflavour condensate \u03a3(3) in Eq. (2.4) may be of a comparable size to \u2013 or even smaller\nthan \u2013 the term ms Z s , reflecting the vacuum effects of massive s\u0304s pairs. At the same\ntime, vacuum fluctuations need not affect the overall convergence of the bare chiral\nexpansion (2.4), i.e., the condition (2.14) can still hold for \"good observables\" such\nas F\u03c02 M\u03c02 . We will call conditionally convergent an observable for which \u03b4A \u226a 1 but\nthe hierarchy condition (2.15) does not hold.\n2.3 Instabilities in chiral series\nStandard \u03c7PT consists of two different steps.\n1. The first step coincides with what has been described above as the \"bare expansion\" in powers of quark masses and external momenta. The coefficients of\nthis expansion are unambiguously defined in terms of parameters of the effective Lagrangian B0 , F0 , Li . . ., independently of the convergence properties of\nthe bare expansion.\n2. The second step consists in rewriting the bare expansion as an expansion in\npowers of Goldstone boson masses, by eliminating order by order the quark\nmasses m and ms and the three-flavour order parameters \u03a3(3), F (3) in favour\nof the physical values of Goldstone boson masses MP2 and decay constants FP2 .\nFor this aim one inverts the expansion of Goldstone boson masses:\n!\nX\n2\n,\n(2.16)\ncB\n2mB0 = M\u03c02 1 +\nP MP + . . .\nP\n\nwhere cB\nP contains the low-energy constants Li and the chiral logarithms. A\nsimilar \"inverted expansion\" is worked out for F02 :\n!\nX\nF02 = F\u03c02 1 +\ncFP MP2 + . . . ,\n(2.17)\nP\n\nand for the quark mass ratio\nms + m\nM2\n= K2\n2m\nM\u03c0\n\n1+\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\nX\nP\n\ncrP MP2\n\n!\n\n+ ... .\n\n(2.18)\n\n\fAs a result of these two steps, observables other than M\u03c02 , MK2 , F\u03c02 (already used\nin Eqs. (2.16), (2.17) and (2.18)) are expressed as expansions in powers of MP2 and\nlog MP2 with their coefficients depending on the constants Li , Ci , etc.\nWe now argue that large vacuum fluctuations of s\u0304s pairs could represent a serious impediment to the second step, i.e., to the perturbative reexpression of order\nparameters. This may happen if the bare expansion (2.5) of Goldstone boson masses\nand decay constants is only conditionally convergent: the leading and next-to-leading\ncontributions are then of comparable size ALO \u223c ANLO , despite a good global convergence \u03b4A \u226a 1. Let us concentrate on the three-flavour GOR ratio X(3), defined\nin Eq. (2.12), which measures the condensate \u03a3(3) in the physical units F\u03c02 M\u03c02 . In\nthe definition of X(3) we can replace F\u03c02 M\u03c02 by its bare expansion (2.4) and investigate the behaviour of X(3) in limits of small quark masses. First of all, in the\nSU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) chiral limit one obtains\nlim X(3) =\n\nm\u21920\n\n\u03a3(3)\n\u03a3(2)\n\n(ms fixed),\n\n(2.19)\n\nfrom the definition of the two-flavour condensate \u03a3(2) \u2261 limm\u21920 F\u03c02 M\u03c02 /(2m). On\nthe other hand, if both m and ms tend to zero, we obtain by definition:\nlim X(3) = 1 .\n\nm,ms \u21920\n\n(2.20)\n\nConsequently, as long as the three-flavour condensate \u03a3(3) is suppressed with respect\nto the two-flavour condensate \u03a3(2) (\u03a3(3) \u223c \u03a3(2)/2 is suggested by the sum rule\nanalysis in Refs. [5, 6, 8]), the physical value of X(3) cannot be simultaneously\nclose to its limiting values in both SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2), Eq. (2.19), and SU(3) \u00d7 SU(3),\nEq. (2.20).\nWe expect the limit \"m \u2192 0, ms physical\" to be a good approximation of\nthe physical situation of very light u and d quarks, and thus the limiting value\nexpressed by Eq. (2.19) to be quite close to the physical X(3). On the other hand,\nthe variation of X(3) between ms = 0 and ms physical may be substantial, due to\nimportant fluctuations of the lowest modes of the (Euclidean) Dirac operator [10],\nwhich correspond to a significant Zweig rule-violating correlation between massless\nnon-strange and massive strange vacuum pairs [11]. The latter contribute to the\ntwo-flavour condensate by the amount ms Z s . (We see from Eq. (2.4) that \u03a3(2) =\n\u03a3(3) + ms Z s + . . ..) As long as \u03a3(3) is comparable to (or smaller than) the \"induced\ncondensate\" ms Z s , the hierarchy condition between LO and NLO Eq. (2.15) will\nbe violated for the bare expansion Eq. (2.4), in spite of a good global convergence\nd\u03c0 \u226a 1. The inverted expansion of X(3), in which F\u03c02 M\u03c02 is replaced by its expansion\nEq.

In such a case, it is not a good idea to\nreplace in higher orders of the bare expansion X(3) by 1, 2mB0 by M\u03c02 , F02 by F\u03c02 ,\netc.\nA comment is in order before we describe in detail the nonperturbative alternative to eliminating order by order condensate parameters and quark masses in bare\n\u03c7PT expansions. The previous example of X(3) can be stated as a failure of the\nbare expansion of 1/F\u03c02M\u03c02 . Let us remark that this is perfectly compatible with our\nassumption that the bare expansion of the QCD two-point function of axial-current\ndivergences (i.e., F\u03c02 M\u03c02 ) converges globally. Indeed, consider a generic observable A\nwith its bare expansion Eq. (2.15). The latter unambiguously defines the coefficients\nof the bare expansion of 1/A:\nB = BLO + BNLO + B \u03b4B ,\n\nB\u2261\n\n1\n,\nA\n\n(2.22)\n\nin terms of those of A:\nANLO\n1\n,\nBNLO = \u2212 2 ,\nALO\nALO\n(1 \u2212 XA )2\n\u03b4A\nALO\n\u03b4B =\n\u2212 2 ,\nXA \u2261\n.\n2\nXA\nXA\nA\n\nBLO =\n\n(2.23)\n(2.24)\n\nOne observes that the global convergence of A does not necessarily imply the convergence of B = 1/A . If the expansion of A is only conditionally convergent, i.e.,\nif the relative leading-order contribution XA is not close to 1, then \u03b4(1/A) need not\nbe small \u2013 even in the extreme case \u03b4A = 0. This explains the origin of instabilities\nand large coefficients in the inverted expansion such as (2.16), (2.17) or (2.21). At\nthe same time, it motivates the restriction to a linear space of \"good observables\"\nfor which \u03b4A \u226a 1. The latter is assumed to be represented by connected QCD\ncorrelators, and a priori excludes nonlinear functions of them such as ratios.\n\n3. Constraints from Goldstone boson masses and decay constants\nThe conditional convergence of FP2 MP2 and/or of FP2 does not by itself bar experimental determination of three-flavour order parameters X(3) and Z(3). It just may\nprevent the use of perturbation theory in relating them to observable quantities. In\nthis section a systematic nonperturbative alternative is considered in detail.\nThe starting point is the standard bare expansion of FP2 MP2 and FP2 for P =\n\u03c0, K, \u03b7. (See Eq. (2.4) for the pion case.) As discussed above, these particular\ncombinations of masses and decay constants are expected to converge well, since\nthey are linearly related to two-point functions of axial/vector currents and of their\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\fdivergences taken at vanishing momentum transfer. As long as Z(3) = F02 /F\u03c02 \u223c 1,\nthe convergence of MP2 would be as good as for FP2 MP2 . If however FP2 is only\nconditionally convergent (i.e., Z(3) significantly smaller than 1), the expansion of MP2\ncould become unstable, in contrast with that of FP2 MP2 ; the perturbative expansion\nof 1/FP2 would then exhibit very poor convergence. We have no prejudice in this\nrespect: the size of Z(3) as well as that of X(3) remain an open problem until they\nare inferred from the data.\nThe expansion of FP2 MP2 and FP2 can be written in the generic form (2.5), denoting\nthe corresponding NNLO remainders by dP and eP respectively. The LO of FP2 MP2 is\ngiven by the condensate \u03a3(3) and the NLO contribution is fully determined by the\nstandard O(p4) LEC's L6 (\u03bc), L8 (\u03bc) (and L7 in the case of the \u03b7 meson). Similarly, at\nLO FP2 coincides with the order parameter F02 = F 2 (3) and the NLO contribution is\ngiven in terms of L5 (\u03bc) and L4 (\u03bc). All necessary formulae can be found in Ref. [13].\nHere, we follow the notation of the above reference and for the reader's convenience\nthe bare expansions of FP2 MP2 and FP2 are reproduced in App. A.\n3.1 Pions and kaons\nFor P = \u03c0, K the mass and decay-constant identities (Ward identities) consist of\nfour equations that involve X(3), Z(3), r = ms /m, L6 , L8 , L4 , L5 and four NNLO\nremainders d\u03c0 , dK , e\u03c0 , eK . These identities \u2013 given in App. A \u2013 are exact as long as\nthe remainders dP , eP are maintained in the formulae and no expansion is performed.\nAs explained in Refs.

(3.1) and (3.9)-(3.10) can be used to illustrate explicitly\nthe instabilities which may arise in the perturbative expression of X(3) and Z(3) in\npowers of MP2 . In the perturbative treatment of three-flavour \u03c7PT [3], one uses the\nfact that Y (3) = 1 + O(MP2 ) to set systematically Y (3) = 1 whenever it appears\nin the NLO term. One first uses Eqs (3.9) and (3.10) to eliminate FK2 /F\u03c02 and\nr = ms /m in terms of \u2206L5 and \u2206L8 . The result reads:\nFK2\nMK2 \u2212 M\u03c02\n= 1+8\n\u2206L5 + . . .\nF\u03c02\nF\u03c02\n\u0012\n\u0013\nMK2 \u2212 M\u03c02\nMK2\n[\u2206L5 \u2212 2\u2206L8 ] + . . . .\nr+1 = 2 2 1+8\nM\u03c0\nF\u03c02\n\n(3.14)\n(3.15)\n\nIn these formulae the quark mass ratio r appearing in the expressions for \u2206Li has\nto be replaced by its leading order value (obtained from Eq. (3.15)):\nr0 = 2\n\nMK2\n\u2212 1 \u223c 24 .\nM\u03c02\n\n(3.16)\n\nStrictly speaking, Eqs. (3.14) and (3.15) do not get any direct contribution from the\nvacuum fluctuation of s\u0304s pairs which violate the Zweig rule and are tracked by L6\nand L4 . The situation is quite different in the case of the identities (3.1) for X(3) and\nZ(3), where the terms describing fluctuations are potentially dangerous. Expressing\nthem perturbatively one gets:\nM\u03c02\n2MK2 + M\u03c02\n\u2206L\n\u2212\n16\n\u2206L6 + . . .\n8\nF\u03c02\nF\u03c02\n2MK2 + M\u03c02\nM2\n\u2206L4 + . . .\nZ(3) = 1 \u2212 8 2\u03c0 \u2206L5 \u2212 8\nF\u03c0\nF\u03c02\n\nX(3) = 1 \u2212 16\n\n(3.17)\n(3.18)\n\nThe large coefficients characteristic of the perturbative treatment of 1/(F\u03c02 M\u03c02 ) \u2013\nand to some extent also of 1/F\u03c02 \u2013 now become visible. Eqs. (3.17) and (3.18) lead\nnumerically to:\nX(3) = 1 \u2212 37\u2206L8 \u2212 950\u2206L6 + . . .\n\nZ(3) = 1 \u2212 18\u2206L5 \u2212 475\u2206L4 + . . .\n\n(3.19)\n(3.20)\n\nIn Eqs. (3.17) and (3.18), the main NLO contribution comes from the MK2 enhanced term proportional to the O(p4 ) Zweig-rule violating LEC's L6 and L4 . If\nthe latter stay close to their critical values (corresponding to Eq. (3.8) for r = 25), the\nNLO contributions remain small. On the other hand, even though the values of L4\nand L6 are unknown yet, dispersive relations have been used to constrain their values:\n \u0304\nLr6 (M\u03c1 ) = (0.6\u00b10.2)*10\u22123 based on sum rules for the correlator h(\u016bu+ dd)s\u0304si\n[5, 6, 8],\n\n\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n\fand Lr4 (M\u03c1 ) = (0.2\u00b10.3)*10\u22123 from \u03c0K scattering data [19]. Such estimates \u2013 rather\ndifferent from the critical values \u2013 suggest a significant violation of the Zweig rule in\nthe scalar sector, and an important role for the vacuum fluctuations of ss\u0304 pairs in\nthe patterns of chiral symmetry breaking.\nAs an exercise, for illustrative purposes, we will now use the central values of\nthe above sum-rule estimates to study the convergence of Eqs. (3.17)-(3.18). We\nactually aim in this paper at providing a framework to determine more accurately\nthe size of vacuum fluctuations directly from experimental observables. If we take\nLr5 (M\u03c1 ) = 1.4 * 10\u22123 and Lr8 (M\u03c1 ) = 0.9 * 10\u22123 [3, 16], the numerical evaluation of\nEqs. (3.17)-(3.18) leads to the decomposition:\nQty = LO + [fluct + other] + NNLO\nX(3) \u2261\n\n2m\u03a3(3)\n= 1 \u2212 [0.82 + 0.04] + O(p4 )\nF\u03c02 M\u03c02\n\nF (3)2\n= 1 \u2212 [0.34 + 0.04] + O(p4 )\nZ(3) \u2261\n2\nF\u03c0\n(r + 1)\n\n(3.21)\n\nM\u03c02\n= 1 \u2212 [0.00 + 0.06] + O(p4 ) .\n2MK2\n\nFor each quantity, the right-hand side is the sum of the leading term (1), the NLO\nterm (the sum in brackets) and higher-order terms. The NLO term is decomposed\ninto its two contributions: the first one comes from the fluctuation term (proportional\nto \u2206L4 or \u2206L6 ) and the second one collects all other NLO contributions. Fluctuation\nparameters have a dramatic effect on the convergence \u2013 they are the only terms\nenhanced by a factor of MK2 in Eqs. (3.17) and (3.18).\nIt should be stressed that the instability of the perturbative expansion of X(3)\nand Z(3) does not originate from higher order terms in the expansion (2.4) of F\u03c02 M\u03c02 .\nThe latter actually factorize, and can be cleanly separated from the effect of vacuum\nfluctuations. This can most easily be established in the SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) limit (2.19).\nUsing a bar to indicate that a quantity is evaluated for m = 0 and fixed ms 6= 0, one\nhas\nF 2M 2\n(3.22)\n\u03a3(2) = lim \u03c0 \u03c0 = \u03a3(3) + 32B02 ms \u2206L6 + \u03a3(2)d \u0304\u03c0 ,\nm\u21920 2m\nwhere\nM\u0304\u03b72 \u0011\n2\nM\u0304K2\n1 \u0010\nlog\n+\nlog\n.\n(3.23)\n\u2206L6 = Lr6 (\u03bc) \u2212\n512\u03c0 2\n\u03bc2\n9\n\u03bc2\nConsequently,\n1\n\u03a3(3)\n=\n(1 \u2212 d \u0304\u03c0 ) .\n(3.24)\nX\u0304(3) =\nms B0\n\u03a3(2)\n1 + 32 2 \u2206L6\nF0\n\n\u2013 17 \u2013\n\n\fWe expect the effect of nonzero m to be tiny; in particular, \u2206L6 \u2243 \u2206L6 , d\u03c0 \u2243 d \u0304\u03c0 =\nd \u0304 = O(m2s ) and X\u0304(3) \u2243 X(3). Similarly, using the expansion of decay constants\ndisplayed in Appendix A, one gets\nZ\u0304(3) =\n\nF (3)2\n=\nF (2)2\n\n1\n(1 \u2212 \u0113\u03c0 ) ,\nms B0\n1 + 16 2 \u2206L4\nF0\n\n(3.25)\n\nwhere \u0113\u03c0 = \u0113 = O(m2s ) and:\n\u2206L4 = Lr4 (\u03bc) \u2212\n\nM\u0304K2\n1\nlog\n.\n256\u03c0 2\n\u03bc2\n\n(3.26)\n\nEqs. (3.24) and (3.25) are exact identities, in which the whole effect of higher orders\nis gathered into the O(m2s ) NNLO remainders d \u0304\u03c0 and \u0113\u03c0 . Even if the latter are small\n(\u223c 10%), the expansion of X\u0304(3) and Z\u0304(3) in powers of ms may break down, provided\nthe magnitudes of \u2206L6 and \u2206L4 are as mentioned above. The SU(2)\u00d7SU(2) limit of\nEqs. (3.17) and (3.18) just exhibits the first term of such an expansion. Let us stress\nthat we chose the SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) limit for simplicity here, but that the factorisation\nof higher order corrections is a general result (holding even for m 6= 0) [13].\nOne more remark is in order, concerning the special case in which both \u2206L4 and\n\u2206L6 are large, but satisfy:\n\u2206L4 = 2\u2206L6 .\n\n(3.27)\n\nWith this particular relation between the low-energy constants, one has:\n\u0232 (3) =\n\n2mB0\nX\u0304(3)\n1 \u2212 d \u0304\u03c0\n= lim\n=\n\u22481.\n1 \u2212 \u0113\u03c0\nZ\u0304(3) m\u21920 M\u03c02\n\n(3.28)\n\nThis would describe a situation in which the (large) vacuum fluctuations suppress\nboth the condensate \u03a3(3) and the decay constant F02 , i.e., partially restore the chiral\nsymmetry, and yet the ratio \u03a3(3)/F02 = B0 remains nonzero.\n3.3 Nonperturbative elimination of O(p4) LEC's\nWe have just seen that the perturbative treatment of chiral series fails if vacuum\nfluctuations of q\u0304q pairs are large, resulting in instabilities in the chiral expansions. In\nthis case, the nonlinearities in Eq. (3.1), relating order and fluctuation parameters,\nare crucial, and we must not linearize these relations (hence the inadequacy of a\nperturbative treatment).\nWe should therefore treat Eq. (3.1) without performing any approximation. Following Ref. [13], we can exploit Eqs. (3.1) to express the chiral order parameters\nX(3) and Z(3) as functions of the fluctuation parameters \u03c1 and \u03bb. The ratio of\n\n\u2013 18 \u2013\n\n\forder parameters Y (3) is 5 :\nY (3) =\n\n1 \u2212 \u03b7(r) \u2212 e +\n\np\n\n2[1 \u2212 \u01eb(r) \u2212 d]\n.\n[1 \u2212 \u03b7(r) \u2212 e]2 + [\u03c1 \u2212 \u03bb][1 \u2212 \u01eb(r) \u2212 d]\n\n(3.29)\n\nThe nonlinear character of Eqs. (3.1) results in the (nonperturbative) square root.\nWe see that the behaviour of Y (3) is controlled by the fluctuation parameter \u03c1 \u2212 \u03bb,\ni.e., 2L6 \u2212 L4 as can be seen from Eqs. (3.5).\nThe perturbative treatment sketched in the previous section corresponds to linearising Eq. (3.29), assuming that the fluctuation parameter \u03c1 \u2212 \u03bb \u226a 1. This is\ninvalid if large fluctuations occur: \u03c1 and/or \u03bb are then numerically of order 1, although they count as O(p2) in the chiral limit. Eq. (3.29) leads to the suppression of\nY (3), which would contribute to a stabilisation of Eq. (3.1) by reducing the contribution proportional to the fluctuation parameters \u03c1 and \u03bb. As discussed extensively\nin Ref. [13], different behaviours of the fluctuation parameters can result in a rather\nvaried range of patterns of chiral symmetry breaking.\nWe would like to extract information about Nf = 3 chiral symmetry breaking\nfrom physical observables, even in the event that the perturbative expansion breaks\ndown. We could proceed in the same way as in Ref. [13] and express as many\nquantities as possible in terms of L4 and L6 , in order to stress the role played by\nvacuum fluctuations. In the present paper, we find it more convenient to take as\nindependent quantities the (more fundamental) chiral order parameters X(3) and\nZ(3). We should emphasize that this corresponds to a different choice from that\nadopted in the perturbative treatment of chiral series: in standard \u03c7PT, X(3), Z(3),\nr, FK /F\u03c0 are iteratively expressed in terms of L4 , L5 , L6 , L8 . In contrast, we start\nby the same four identities and express nonperturbatively L4 , L5 , L6 , L8 in terms of\nX(3), Z(3), r, FK /F\u03c0 ; this is a sensible treatment provided that both LO and NLO\nterms are considered.\nKeeping in mind that LO and NLO contributions can have a similar size, we treat\nas exact identities the expansions of good observables in powers of quark masses, and\nexploit the mass and decay constant identities to reexpress O(p2) and O(p4) LEC's\nin terms of r, X(3), Z(3), observables quantities and NNLO remainders.

The\npresence of powers of Y (3), i.e., B0 , follows from the normalisation of the scalar and\npseudoscalar sources in Ref. [3]: these powers arise only for O(p4) LEC's related to\nchiral symmetry breaking (two powers for L6 , L7 , L8 , one for L4 and L5 ), and are\nabsent for LEC's associated with purely derivative terms.\nPlugging these identities into \u03c7PT expansions corresponds therefore to a resummation of vacuum fluctuations, as opposed to the usual (iterative and perturbative)\ntreatment of the same chiral series. We can then reexpress observables in terms of the\nthree parameters of interest X(3), Z(3), r and NNLO remainders. Before describing\nhow to exploit experimental information to constrain these parameters, we should\nfirst comment on the case of the \u03b7-meson.\n\n\u2013 20 \u2013\n\n\f3.4 The \u03b7-mass and the Gell-Mann\u2013Okubo formula\nIt remains for us to discuss the mass and decay constant of \u03b7 as constrained by\nWard identities for two-point functions of the eighth component of the axial current\nand of its divergence. This results into two additional relations (given in App. A)\nthat involve one new NLO constant L7 and two extra NNLO remainders d\u03b7 and\ne\u03b7 . These two identities will be used to reexpress the LEC L7 in terms of order\nparameters and quark mass ratio, and to eliminate the decay-constant F\u03b7 , which is\nnot directly accessible experimentally. This new discussion is closely related to the\nold question [28] whether the remarkable accuracy of the Gell-Mann\u2013Okubo (GO)\nformula for Goldstone bosons finds a natural explanation within \u03c7PT and what it\nsays about the size of the three-flavour condensate.\nThe combination:\nDGO = 3F\u03b72M\u03b72 \u2212 4FK2 MK2 + F\u03c02 M\u03c02\n\n(3.41)\n\ndoes not receive any O(p2) contribution from the genuine condensate \u03a3(3). The\n\u03b7-mass identity (A.10) leads to the following simple formula for DGO , expressed in\nunits F\u03c02 M\u03c02 :\n\u2206GO \u2261\n\nM\u03c02\nDGO\n=\n16\n(r \u2212 1)2 [Y (3)]2 (2L7 + \u2206L8 ) + dGO ,\nF\u03c02 M\u03c02\nF\u03c02\n\n(3.42)\n\nwhere \u2206L8 was defined in Eq.

If one follows Sec. 3.2 and treats the exact formulae (3.42) and (3.43)\nperturbatively, one reproduces the O(p4) expressions given in Ref. [3], as expected.\nRemarkably, the identities (3.42) and (3.43) are simpler and more transparent\nthan their perturbative version, and we find them useful to make a few numerical\nestimates which may be relevant for a discussion of the GO formula. For this purpose\nwe shall use the value r = r0 \u223c 24 of the quark mass ratio and neglect for a moment\nthe NNLO remainders dGO and eGO , as well as error bars related to the experimental\ninputs on masses and decay constants. For this exercise, we also disregard isospin\nbreaking and electromagnetic corrections. First, the dependence of F\u03b7 on Y (3) =\n2mB0 /M\u03c02 is negligibly small:\nF\u03b72\n= 1.651 + 0.036 * Y (3) .\nF\u03c02\n\n\u2013 21 \u2013\n\n(3.45)\n\n\fIn the estimate of \u2206GO = DGO /F\u03c02 M\u03c02 , we use F\u03b72 /F\u03c02 = 1.687 and find:\n\u2206GO = 77.70 \u2212 74.46 + 1 = 4.24 .\n\n(3.46)\n\nWe have split the result into the three contributions corresponding respectively to \u03b7,\nK and \u03c0, in order to emphasize the accuracy of the formula. If we drop the decay\nconstants in \u2206GO , we obtain:\n \u0304 GO =\n\u2206\n\n3M\u03b72 \u2212 4MK2 + M\u03c02\n= 46.06 \u2212 50.03 + 1 = \u22122.97 .\nM\u03c02\n\n(3.47)\n\nHence, apart from a change of sign, this more familiar definition of the GO discrepancy is of a comparable magnitude as \u2206GO . For the reasons already stressed, the\ninterpretation in terms of QCD correlation functions is more straightforward when\nFP2 MP2 is used.\nIf the origin of the GO formula were to be naturally explained by the dominance\nof the O(p2 ) condensate term in the expansion of FP2 MP2 , the order of magnitude\nof the estimate (3.46) should be reproduced by Eq. (3.42) for a typical order of\nmagnitude of the O(p4 ) LEC's L8 and L7 without any fine tuning of their values.\nUsing Eq. (3.9) and neglecting the NNLO remainder d\u2032 , one gets:\n16\n\nM\u03c02\n(r \u2212 1)2 [Y (3)]2 \u2206L8 = (r \u2212 1)2 [\u01eb(r) + d\u2032 ] = 22.5\n2\nF\u03c0\n\n[r = r0 ] .\n\n(3.48)\n\nHence, the typical O(p4) contribution \u2206L8 to \u2206GO happens to be nearly one order\nof magnitude bigger than the estimate (3.46): the latter can only be reproduced by\ntuning very finely the LEC L7 :\n[Y (3)]2 (\u2206L8 + 2L7 ) \u2243 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22124 ,\n\n(3.49)\n\nto be compared with the above estimate [Y (3)]2 \u2206L8 \u2243 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22123. All this of course\ndoes not reveal any contradiction, but it invalidates the customary \"explanation\" of\nthe GO formula and the standard argument against a possible suppression of the\nthree-flavour condensate \u03a3(3). Therefore, the fact that the GO formula is satisfied\nso well remains unexplained independently of the size of \u03a3(3) and of the vacuum\nfluctuations. The last point can be explicitly verified: the genuine condensate contribution \u03a3(3) as well as the induced condensate ms Z s , which represents an O(p4)\ncontribution to FP2 MP2 , both drop out of the GO combination (3.41).\nWe now return to our framework: we do not assume a particular hierarchy\nbetween LO and NLO contributions to chiral series, and we do not neglect any\nlonger the NNLO remainders (in the case of the \u03b7-meson, dGO and eGO might be\nsizeable and should be kept all the way through). It is possible to use the previous\nformulae to reexpress L7 in a similar way to Eqs. (3.33)-(3.36):\n\u0014\n1\nF\u03c02 3F\u03b72M\u03b72 \u2212 4FK2 MK2 + F\u03c02 M\u03c02\n2\n[Y (3)] L7 =\n(3.50)\n32(r \u2212 1)2 M\u03c02\nF\u03c02 M\u03c02\n\n\u2013 22 \u2013\n\n\f\u0015\n3F\u03b72 M\u03b72 d\u03b7 \u2212 4FK2 MK2 dK + F\u03c02 M\u03c02 d\u03c0\n.\n\u2212(r \u2212 1) [\u01eb(r) + d ] \u2212\nF\u03c02 M\u03c02\n2\n\n\u2032\n\nThis expression should be used to reexpress nonperturbatively L7 in terms of chiral\norder parameters (F\u03b72 is given by Eq. (3.43)). We can already notice that in Eq. (3.50),\nthe first contribution, which corresponds to \u2206GO , is 5 to 10 times suppressed with\nrespect to the second term (r \u2212 1)2 [\u01eb(r) + d\u2032 ].\n\n4. Three-flavour analysis of \u03c0\u03c0 scattering\nThe quantities B0 m, r, F0 , L4 ,...,L8 appear in the bare chiral series up to NLO.\nThe procedure outlined above allows us to express these eight quantities in terms of\nthe masses and decay constants of Goldstone bosons. Apart from the (presumably\nsmall) six NNLO remainders dP and eP , this leaves three unknown parameters. We\nchoose these three parameters to be the order parameters X(3) and Z(3), and the\nquark mass ratio r. The remaining terms of the O(p4 ) chiral Lagrangian, involving\nthe LEC's L1 , L2 , L3 , L9 , and L10 , do not affect the symmetry breaking sector of\nthe underlying theory in which we are mainly interested here.\nThe counting of the degrees of freedom is completely analogous to the one described in Ref. [17], where a global two-loop fit has been performed to the masses,\ndecay constants and Ke4 form factors. In this reference, the LEC's L1 , L2 and L3 were\nalso included and constrained by the three experimental results corresponding to the\ntwo Ke4 form factors at threshold and to their slope. The three parameters left undetermined in the fits of Ref. [17] are the ratio of quark masses r and the O(p4) LEC's\nL4 and L6 . The unknown O(p6) LEC's, estimated in the above reference through\na resonance saturation assumption, introduce some theoretical uncertainty. In our\napproach, this uncertainty is included in the NNLO remainders. We keep the latter\nthroughout our calculation; however, at some point of the numerical analysis we will\nhave to make an educated guess as to their sizes. The main differences between our\napproach and that of Ref. [17] lie in our use of a nonperturbative resummation of\ninstabilities, compared to the canonical two-loop perturbative elimination of O(p4)\nLEC's; in our choice of X(3), Z(3), r as the three undetermined parameters, rather\nthan L4 , L6 , r; and in our treatment of higher-order remainders: in Ref. [17] they are\ncomputed up to O(p6), and the additional LEC's arising at this order are estimated\nthrough resonance saturation.\nIn order to constrain our three independent parameters, more information is\nneeded. In the present section we will examine the impact of our knowledge of \u03c0\u03c0\nscattering observables. We have previously analysed the \u03c0\u03c0 data of Ref. [14] in terms\nof two-flavour order parameters, allowing a rather precise determination of them [15]:\nX(2) = 0.81 \u00b1 0.07 and Z(2) = 0.89 \u00b1 0.03. However, the \u03c0\u03c0 scattering parameters\nare more sensitive to the two-flavour order parameters than to the three-flavour\n\n\u2013 23 \u2013\n\n\fones [7, 11, 29]. Expanding X(2) in SU(3) \u00d7 SU(3) \u03c7PT one can obtain [11]:\n\u0003\n2\nr \u0002\n1 \u2212 \u01eb(r) \u2212 d \u2212 Y (3)2 f1 +\nX(3) ,\n(4.1)\nX(2)(1 \u2212 d \u0304\u03c0 ) =\nr+2\nr+2\nwhere f1 is a (small) combination of chiral logarithms, whose precise definition is\nrecalled in Eq. (4.24) below; in Ref. [11] the estimate f1 \u223c 0.05 was obtained.\nIf \u01eb(r) is not close to 1, i.e., if r larger than 15, the term in square brackets in\nEq. (4.1) is dominant. Then X(2) has only a very weak (r-suppressed) sensitivity to\nX(3). On the other hand, its value is strongly correlated with r. We expect therefore\n\u03c0\u03c0 scattering to provide us with valuable information about the quark mass ratio r,\nbut not about the Nf = 3 order parameters X(3) and Z(3). This section is devoted\nto designing a framework testing this expectation in a quantitative way.\n4.1 Low-energy \u03c0\u03c0 amplitude\nConsiderable progress has been achieved recently in the understanding of \u03c0\u03c0 scattering. The solutions of the Roy equations [30] allow one to express the amplitude,\nin the whole energy domain below 800 MeV, in terms of only two parameters (e.g.,\nthe scalar scattering lengths, or the parameters \u03b1\u03c0\u03c0 and \u03b2\u03c0\u03c0 defined below), with\nvery small uncertainty. It is therefore possible to determine experimentally these\ntwo parameters in a model-independent way. Furthermore, at low energy the \u03c0\u03c0\namplitude is strongly constrained by chiral symmetry, crossing and unitarity. It can\nbe expressed, up to and including terms of order (p/\u039bH )6 , as:\nA\u03c0\u03c0 (s|t, u) = P (s|t, u) + J \u0304(s|t, u) + O[(p/\u039bH )8 ]\n\n(4.2)\n\nwhere P (s|t, u) is a polynomial conveniently written (following the conventions and\nnotation of Ref.

J(s|t,\nu) collects the unitarity cuts arising from elastic \u03c0\u03c0 intermediate states. At low energy, the contributions of K K\u0304 and \u03b7\u03b7 intermediate states are not neglected but expanded and absorbed\n \u0304\ninto the polynomial P (s|t, u). The general form of J(s|t,\nu) is dictated by successive\niterations of the unitarity condition and it is entirely determined by the first four\nsubthreshold parameters up to O(p6):\n \u0304\nJ(s|t,\nu) = U(s)J \u0304\u03c0\u03c0 (s)\n+[(s \u2212 u)V (t) + W (t)]J \u0304\u03c0\u03c0 (t)\n+[(s \u2212 t)V (u) + W (u)]J \u0304\u03c0\u03c0 (u) + . . . ,\n\n\u2013 24 \u2013\n\n(4.4)\n\n\fwhere\ns\nJ \u0304\u03c0\u03c0 (s) =\n16\u03c0 2\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n4M\u03c02\n\ndx\nx(x \u2212 s)\n\nr\n\nx \u2212 4M\u03c02\n,\nx\n\n(4.5)\n\nU, V, W are polynomials given in terms of the parameters \u03b1\u03c0\u03c0 , \u03b2\u03c0\u03c0 , \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 and the\nellipsis stands for (known) O(p6 ) contributions. (For a more explicit form, see\nEqs. (3.18) and (3.47) of Ref. [24].)\nAs a first step, the general representation (4.2) of the low-energy \u03c0\u03c0 amplitude\ncan be matched with experimental phase shifts [14] and with the solution of Roy\nequations [30] in order to determine the subthreshold parameters \u03b1\u03c0\u03c0 , \u03b2\u03c0\u03c0 , . . .. This\nhas been done in Ref. [15], independently of any \u03c7PT expansion or predictions,\nleading to the following values:\n\u03b1\u03c0\u03c0 = 1.381 \u00b1 0.242 ,\n\n\u03b2\u03c0\u03c0 = 1.081 \u00b1 0.023 ,\n\n(4.6)\n\nwith the correlation coefficient between the two parameters \u03c1\u03b1\u03b2 = \u22120.14.\nAt the second stage, \u03c7PT can be used to expand the subthreshold parameters\n\u03b1\u03c0\u03c0 , \u03b2\u03c0\u03c0 , \u03bb1 , . . . \u03bb4 in powers of quark masses mu = md = m and/or ms , thereby\nconstraining the possible values of chiral order parameters. Notice that the expansion\nof the subthreshold parameters is expected to converge better than that of scattering\nlengths, the latter being more sensitive to small variations of the pion mass. Similarly,\nas already discussed in Secs. 2 and 3, one should bear in mind the possibility of\na strong dependence of F\u03c02 on ms : it seems therefore preferable to consider the\nexpansion of F\u03c04 A\u03c0\u03c0 , i.e., the on-shell four-point function of the axial-vector current\n(rather than the scattering amplitude itself) in powers of quark masses and external\npion momenta. In Ref. [15] the corresponding expansion of subthreshold parameters\n\u03b1\u03c0\u03c0 and \u03b2\u03c0\u03c0 in powers of m (with ms fixed at its physical value) was converted into a\ndetermination of the two-flavour order parameters X(2) and Z(2). Now we consider\nthe \"bare expansion\" of F\u03c02 M\u03c02 \u03b1\u03c0\u03c0 and of the slope parameter F\u03c02 \u03b2\u03c0\u03c0 in powers of\nm and ms in order to investigate directly how tightly the available \u03c0\u03c0 experimental\ninformation constrains the three-flavour condensate X(3) and decay constant F0 (or\nZ(3)), and the quark mass ratio r = ms /m.\nIn order to establish the \"bare\" SU(3) \u00d7 SU(3) expansion of F\u03c02 M\u03c02 \u03b1\u03c0\u03c0 and of\nF\u03c02 \u03b2\u03c0\u03c0 we proceed as follows. We start by rewriting LO and NLO \u03c7PT contributions\nin a form similar to Eq. (4.2):\nF\u03c04 A\u03c0\u03c0 (s|t, u) = F\u03c04 P r (s|t, u) + F\u03c04 J r (s|t, u) + . . . .\n\n(4.7)\n\nP r (s|t, u) collects all LO and NLO tree and tadpole contributions and is of the\nform (4.3) with the two cubic terms omitted. The second term collects the one-loop\ncontribution of order O(p4). Both are renormalized and separately depend on the\nrenormalisation scale \u03bc. The loop part reads:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 r\n2 1 r\n4 r\nF\u03c0 J (s|t, u) = s\nJ (s) + JKK (s)\n2 \u03c0\u03c0\n8\n\n\u2013 25 \u2013\n\n\f+M\u03c04\n\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1 r\n1 r\n\u2212 J\u03c0\u03c0 (s) + J\u03b7\u03b7 (s)\n2\n18\n\n1\nr\nr\n(t) + (u \u2212 2M\u03c02 )2 J\u03c0\u03c0\n(u)]\n+ [(t \u2212 2M\u03c02 )2 J\u03c0\u03c0\n4\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 r\nr\n+(s \u2212 u)t M\u03c0\u03c0\n(t) + MKK\n(t)\n2\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 r\nr\n+(s \u2212 t)u M\u03c0\u03c0 (u) + MKK (u) .\n2\n\n(4.8)\n\nHere JPr P and MPr P are the standard loop functions for the Goldstone boson P (see,\ne.g., ref. [24]). They are related to the functions J \u0304P P (s) through:\nJPr P (s) = J \u0304P P (s) \u2212 2kP P ,\n1\n1\ns \u2212 4MP2  \u0304\nJP P (s) \u2212 kP P +\n.\nMPr P (s) =\n12s\n6\n288\u03c0 2\n\n(4.9)\n(4.10)\n\nAt low energy and for P = K, \u03b7, the loop functions are replaced by their expansion\nat small s:\n1\nJPr P = \u22122kP P , MPr P = \u2212 kP P .\n(4.11)\n6\nIn these equations, we have kP P = [log(MP2 /\u03bc2 ) + 1]/32\u03c0 2.\nMultiplying Eq. (4.4) by F\u03c04 and dropping all terms beyond O(p4 ), one should\nrecover the formula (4.8). This fact can be used to work out the bare expansion of\nthe subthreshold parameters contained in F\u03c04 P (s|t, u). Comparing (4.4) and (4.8)\nleads to:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n4\n4 r\n2\nF\u03c0 P (s|t, u) = F\u03c0 P (s|t, u) \u2212 s k\u03c0\u03c0 + kKK\n4\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n+M\u03c04 k\u03c0\u03c0 \u2212 k\u03b7\u03b7\n9\n1\n\u2212 [(t \u2212 2M\u03c02 )2 + (u \u2212 2M\u03c02 )2 ]k\u03c0\u03c0\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n1\n\u2212 [(s \u2212 u)t + (s \u2212 t)u] k\u03c0\u03c0 + kKK \u2212\n,\n(4.12)\n6\n2\n48\u03c0 2\nwhich holds for all powers of s, t, u provided that one retains just the LO and NLO\npowers in quark masses in the expression of corresponding coefficients. In agreement with the convention explained in Sec. 2.2, we keep the physical Goldstone\nboson masses in the arguments of chiral logarithms arising from both tadpoles and\nunitarity loops. The right-hand side of Eq. (4.12) is checked to be independent of\nrenormalisation scale \u03bc. The resulting \"bare expansion\" of the two subthreshold\nparameters which carry information on the symmetry-breaking sector reads:\nF\u03c02 M\u03c02 \u03b1\u03c0\u03c0 = 2m\u03a3(3) + 16m2 A + 2m(8m + ms )Z s\n\n\u2013 26 \u2013\n\n\fF\u03c02 \u03b2\u03c0\u03c0\n\n \u0303\n\u22128m2 B0 (\u03be + 2\u03be)\n\u0013\n\u0012\n7\nMK2\n1 2 2\n+ F\u03c02 M\u03c02 d\u03b1,\u03c0\u03c0 ,\n+ 2 m B0 4 log 2 \u2212\n8\u03c0\nM\u03c0\n3\n2\n \u0303\n= F0 + 4m\u03be + 2(4m + ms )\u03be\n\u0015\n\u0014\nM\u03b72\n5\nMK2\n1\n+ F\u03c02 e\u03b2,\u03c0\u03c0 .\n+ 2 mB0 log 2 + 2 log 2 \u2212\n4\u03c0\nMK\nM\u03c0\n4\n\n(4.13)\n\n(4.14)\n\nThe subthreshold parameters are thus expressed in terms of A, Z s , \u03be, \u03be\u0303, which are\ndefined in App. A as scale-invariant combinations of the O(p4) LEC's and chiral\nlogarithms. In order to account for NNLO and higher chiral orders, we have added\nin Eqs. (4.13)-(4.14) the direct NNLO remainders d\u03b1,\u03c0\u03c0 and e\u03b2,\u03c0\u03c0 . (Their exact role in\nour analysis will be discussed shortly.) We would like to stress that the only quantities\nwe really subject to a chiral expansion are the subthreshold parameters multiplied\nby appropriate powers of F\u03c02 and M\u03c02 . The scattering amplitude as a function of\ns, t, u is given by Eq. (4.2), which holds up to and including O(p6 ) accuracy with all\nsingularities and threshold factors correctly described using the physical Goldstone\nboson masses.\nWe have just illustrated how the bare expansion of subthreshold parameters is\nobtained in practice. The last step now consists in replacing in the bare expansion\n(4.13)-(4.14) the parameters of the Lagrangian mB0 , ms B0 L4 (\u03bc), L5 (\u03bc), L6 (\u03bc), L8 (\u03bc)\nby the three basic QCD parameters X(3), Z(3), r = ms /m using the identities (3.30)(3.36), which yields:\nr\u01eb(r)\n1 \u2212 X(3)\n1 \u2212 Y (3)\nY (3)r\u03b7(r)\n+2\n+4\n\u22122\nr+2\nr+2\nr+2\nr+2\n\u001a\n\u0014\n\u0015\u001b\n2\nM\u03b72\nM\u03c0\n7\nr\nMK2\n2\n\u2212\nY (3)\n(r + 2) log 2 \u2212 (r \u2212 2) log 2\n+\n32\u03c0 2 F\u03c02\n3 (r \u2212 1)(r + 2)\nMK\nM\u03c0\n6\n4Y (3)\n\u2212\nd+\ne \u2212 2Y (3)e\u2032 + [(d\u03b1 \u2212 d) + 4d\u2032 ] ,\n(4.15)\nr+2\nr+2\nr\u03b7(r)\n1 \u2212 Z(3)\n= 1+\n+2\nr+2\nr+2\n\u001a\n\u0014\n\u0015\u001b\n2\nM\u03b72\nr\nMK2\nM\u03c0\nY (3) \u22125 +\n(2r + 1) log 2 + (4r + 1) log 2\n+\n32\u03c0 2 F\u03c02\n(r \u2212 1)(r + 2)\nMK\nM\u03c0\n2\n\u2212\ne + [(e\u03b2 \u2212 e) + 2e\u2032 ] .\n(4.16)\nr+2\n\n\u03b1\u03c0\u03c0 = 1 + 3\n\n\u03b2\u03c0\u03c0\n\nThese equations relate the two observable quantities \u03b1\u03c0\u03c0 and \u03b2\u03c0\u03c0 to the three independent parameters X(3), Z(3), r (recall that Y (3) = X(3)/Z(3)), and contain\nthe dependence on the direct remainders d\u03b1,\u03c0\u03c0 , e\u03b2,\u03c0\u03c0 as well as on the indirect ones,\nstemming from the mass and decay constant identities. The order of magnitude of\nsuch remainders can be estimated and will be discussed later.\n\n\u2013 27 \u2013\n\n\f4.2 The Bayesian approach\nThe determination of the three-flavour order parameters from the experimental\nknowledge of \u03b1\u03c0\u03c0 and \u03b2\u03c0\u03c0 is a subtle issue, due to the nonlinear character of Eqs. (4.15)(4.16) and to the fact that our three independent parameters are subject to constraints (e.g., they have to be positive). Moreover, the NNLO remainders are in fact\nunknown; we can only estimate their order of magnitude. One is led to consider\nthem as sources of error, but the propagation of errors is not so straightforward, precisely because of the above-mentioned non-linearities. For these reasons the standard\nmethod of maximum likelihood is inadequate in this case. A convenient approach is\nprovided by Bayesian analysis [22], as described in App. B.\nWe introduce the correlated probability density function Pexp (\u03b1\u03c0\u03c0 , \u03b2\u03c0\u03c0 ),\n\u221a\n\u0012\n\u0013\ndet C\n1 T\nexp \u2212 V CV ,\nPexp (\u03b1\u03c0\u03c0 , \u03b2\u03c0\u03c0 ) =\n2\u03c0\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b1\u03c0\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b1exp\nc11 c12\nV =\n, C=\n,\n(4.17)\n\u03b2\u03c0\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b2exp\nc12 c22\nwith 1/c11 = \u03b4\u03b12 (1\u2212\u03c12\u03b1\u03b2 ), 1/c22 = \u03b4\u03b22 (1\u2212\u03c12\u03b1\u03b2 ), 1/c12 = \u2212\u03b4\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b2 (1\u2212\u03c12\u03b1\u03b2 )/\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2 , and where\n\u03b1exp , \u03b2exp , \u03b4\u03b1 , \u03b4\u03b2 and \u03c1\u03b1\u03b2 are the experimental results, uncertainties and correlations\ngiven in Eq. (4.6). This distribution summarizes the experimental result: the two\nnumbers, \u03b1exp and \u03b2exp , given with an accuracy specified by the matrix C. Suppose\nnow that we know, independently, the true values of (\u03b1\u03c0\u03c0 , \u03b2\u03c0\u03c0 ); Eq. (4.17) can then\nbe interpreted as the probability of obtaining, when performing an experiment, the\nvalues (\u03b1exp , \u03b2exp ), i.e., the actual observed values, given our independent knowledge\nof (\u03b1\u03c0\u03c0 , \u03b2\u03c0\u03c0 ). Eq. (4.17) is completely symmetric under exchange of (\u03b1\u03c0\u03c0 , \u03b2\u03c0\u03c0 ) with\n(\u03b1exp , \u03b2exp ).\nThis last interpretation is suitable for our problem, in which theory relates the\nsubthreshold parameters \u03b1\u03c0\u03c0 and \u03b2\u03c0\u03c0 to the three parameters X(3), Z(3), r and to\nthe remainders:\n\u03b1\u03c0\u03c0 = A[r, Y (3), Z(3), \u03b41, \u03b42 , \u03b43 , \u03b44 ] ,\n\u03b2\u03c0\u03c0 = B[r, Y (3), Z(3), \u03b42 , \u03b45 ].\n\n(4.18)\n(4.19)\n\nThe relevant remainders, denoted by \u03b4i , i = 1, ..., 5, are defined in Table 1; \u03b46 and \u03b47\nare additional remainders discussed in the following section. Therefore we can say\nthat the probability of obtaining the data effectively observed, for a given choice of\nr, Y (3), Z(3), \u03b4i , is\nP (data|r, Y, Z, \u03b4i ) = Pexp [A(r, Y, Z, \u03b4i ), B(r, Y, Z, \u03b4i )].\n\n(4.20)\n\nThis quantity is the likelihood of the observed experimental data.

If we have no reason to prefer one value to any other,\nthen a flat prior should be chosen. We certainly have to implement the requirement of positivity for X(3) and Z(3), so the support of the function \u03c0 will have\na lower boundary at X(3) = 0, Z(3) = 0. A similar requirement can be applied\nto the two-flavour order parameters X(2) and Z(2).

In our approach this is\nnot required; we allow the data to indicate whether vacuum fluctuations destabilize\nthe chiral series or not. Therefore, apart from the constraints listed above, we will\nchoose a flat prior for the three-flavour order parameters. In fact, this statement\nis ambiguous, since we have introduced three different quantities, X(3), Y (3) and\nZ(3), related by X(3) = Y (3)Z(3). If we restrict the problem to a flat prior in two\nparameters among [X(3), Y (3), Z(3)] \u2261 (X, Y, Z), we can get three different prior\np.d.f.'s in (Y,Z):\n(X, Z) : \u03c0(Y, Z)dY dZ = dXdZ = ZdY dZ \u2192 \u03c0(Y, Z) = Z ,\n(X, Y ) : \u03c0(Y, Z)dY dZ = dXdY = Y dY dZ \u2192 \u03c0(Y, Z) = Y ,\n(Y, Z) : \u03c0(Y, Z)dY dZ = dY dZ\n\u2192 \u03c0(Y, Z) = 1 .\n\n(4.31)\n\nA physical argument helps us to select one of these possibilities. When Z(3) vanishes,\nchiral symmetry restoration occurs and the marginal probabilities of chiral order\nparameters must vanish. This can be obtained if the prior p.d.f. vanishes in the\n6\n\nThe statement is that chiral order parameters dominated by the infrared end of the spectrum\nof the Euclidean Dirac operator should decrease as the number of massless flavours increases.

Henceforth,\nwe will focus on this case and therefore take \u03c0(Y, Z) = Z inside the range allowed\nby the positivity and paramagnetic constraints, and \u03c0(Y, Z) = 0 outside.\nInspired by Eq. (3.1), we restrict the range of variation of r such that 0 \u2264 \u01eb(r) \u2264\n1, which yields the range\nr1 \u2264 r \u2264 r2 ,\n\nr1 = 2\n\nFK MK\n\u2212 1 \u223c 8,\nF\u03c0 M\u03c0\n\nr2 = 2\n\nFK2 MK2\n\u2212 1 \u223c 36 .\nF\u03c02 M\u03c02\n\n(4.32)\n\nNo other previous knowledge is supposed for the quark mass ratio r, so the prior is\ntaken to be flat in r over this allowed domain.\nFinally, we must discuss how to treat the remainders \u03b41 , . . . , \u03b47 . We recall that\nthey are defined as the NNLO contributions in the chiral expansions of a selected\nclass of observables, for which a good overall convergence is expected. Therefore, the\nremainders should be small. This expectation can be implemented in the prior by\nconsidering the remainders as Gaussian distributions centered at zero, with widths\ncorresponding to their expected order of magnitude. Since the size of the corrections\nin the chiral series is 30% for the three-flavour expansions and 10% for the two-flavour\nones, we will use the following rule of thumb, already introduced in footnote 3: the\ntypical size of remainders is (30%)2 = 0.1 for genuine O(m2s ) remainders like d, e,\n30% \u00d7 10% = 0.03 for O(ms m) combination of remainders (such as d\u03b1 \u2212 d, e\u03b2 \u2212 e: see\nbelow), and 0.01 for e\u2032 = O(e/r) and d\u2032 = O(d/r). These assumptions for the widths\nof the Gaussian distributions of the remainders are collected in the last column of\nTable 1.\nAs far as Table 1 is concerned, we still have to show that the two combinations d\u03b1,\u03c0\u03c0 \u2212 d\u03c0 and e\u03b2,\u03c0\u03c0 \u2212 e\u03c0 , contributing to the remainders \u03b44 and \u03b45 , are of\norder O(mms ), instead of O(m2s ). This follows from a SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) low-energy\ntheorem: consider the subthreshold parameters \u03b1\u03c0\u03c0 and \u03b2\u03c0\u03c0 in the Nf = 2 chiral\nlimit, mu , md \u2192 0; from their SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) chiral expansion in powers of m \u2013\nEqs. (32)-(33) of Ref. [15] \u2013 it is straightforward to conclude that\nlim \u03b1\u03c0\u03c0 = 1,\n\nm\u21920\n\nlim \u03b2\u03c0\u03c0 = 1.\n\nm\u21920\n\n(4.33)\n\nThen we combine SU(3) \u00d7 SU(3) chiral expansions of the subthreshold parameters\nand the mass and decay constant identities for the pion, by subtracting Eq. (A.1)\nfrom Eq. (4.15) [and Eq. (A.6) from Eq.

(4.34) [Eq. (4.35)], all the terms involving O(p4)\nLEC's and chiral logarithms are of O(m2 ) [O(m)]. If we divide Eq. (4.34) by F\u03c02 M\u03c02\n[Eq. (4.35) by F\u03c02 ] and take the Nf = 2 chiral limit m \u2192 0, all the terms vanish apart\nfrom the NNLO remainders. The latter must therefore fulfill the following condition:\nlim (d\u03b1,\u03c0\u03c0 \u2212 d\u03c0 ) = 0,\n\nm\u21920\n\nlim (e\u03b2,\u03c0\u03c0 \u2212 e\u03c0 ) = 0,\n\nm\u21920\n\n(4.36)\n\nso that the difference between d\u03b1,\u03c0\u03c0 and d\u03c0 [e\u03b2,\u03c0\u03c0 and e\u03c0 ] is only of order O(mms ).\nHaving collected all the ingredients for our choice of the prior, we can now\nperform the integration over the NNLO remainders to obtain P (r, Y, Z|data). If we\nintegrate the latter with respect to two parameters, we end up with the marginal\n(posterior) probabilities:\nZ\nP (r|data) =\ndY dZ P (r, Y, Z|data)\n(4.37)\nZ\nP (Y |data) =\ndr dZ P (r, Y, Z|data)\n(4.38)\nZ\nP (Z|data) =\ndY dY P (r, Y, Z|data)\n(4.39)\nZ\nP (X|data) =\ndr dY dZ \u03b4(Y Z \u2212 X) P (r, Y, Z|data)\nZ\n1\n(4.40)\n=\ndr dZ P (r, X/Z, Z|data).\nZ\nThe precise expression of P and the numerical evaluation of these integrals are detailed in App. C.\n4.4 Discussion and results\nEven if no information from \u03c0\u03c0 scattering data is included, the results of the integrations (4.37)-(4.40) are nontrivial, because of the interplay of the various constraints\nimposed. For instance, the prior for r, when integrated over all other variables, will\nno longer be uniform. The probability density profiles of Fig. 1 are obtained by\nreplacing P (r, Y, Z, \u03b4i |data) with \u03c0(r, Y, Z, \u03b4i ) and integrating over all but one variable. They can be interpreted as a measure of the \"phase space\" for each parameter\nallowed by the theoretical constraints. The significance of \u03c0\u03c0 data will be seen in\nthe modification induced with respect to such \"reference\" density profiles.\nIn the present framework, we may make more quantitative the well-known mechanism by which a low value of r implies a suppression of the quark condensate [11].\nIn Fig. 2 we show the reference probability density profiles for X, when the quark\nmass ratio r is taken fixed at different values, r = 25, 20, 15, 10. (The ratio of order\nparameters Y (3) behaves similarly.)\nNotice that for small values of r, for which X(3) is very small, the two-flavour order parameter X(2) should also be small. This is clear from inspection of Eqs.

Since we know from our SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) analysis [15]\nof the same \u03c0\u03c0 data that X(2) is very close to 1, we can expect that such data will\nconstrain r to stay away from such small values. This is what we observe in Fig. 3,\nin which we show the marginal probability density profile for r with the inclusion of\nthe \u03c0\u03c0 experimental data.\nThese data induce a substantial change in the distribution as compared to the\nreference probability density profile (restricted phase space). However, such a broad\ndistribution cannot be used for a real determination of r: at most a lower bound\n\n\u2013 33 \u2013\n\n\f3\n\nr=25\nr=20\nr=15\nr=10\n\n2.5\n\nP0(X)r=fixed\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nX(3)\nFigure 2: The reference probability density profiles for the order parameter X(3) when\nthe quark mass ratio r is taken fixed at four different values.\n\nfor r can be given in probabilistic terms: r \u2265 14 at 95% confidence level. The most\nprobable value of r lies at r = 21 \u2212 22, very close to standard expectations. Indeed,\nthe motivation for the rearrangement of the chiral expansions, namely the possible\nimportance of vacuum fluctuations and their potential to destabilize the chiral series,\nis not essential in the case of r: the fluctuation parameters L4 and L6 are absent\nfrom the perturbative reexpression of the chiral series of r, see Eq. (3.15), which may\nthus exhibit no instability even in the case of large fluctuations. It is therefore not\nsurprising that similar values of r are obtained through the perturbative expansion\nEq. (3.15) or the nonperturbative framework presented above. Such similarity is\nactually a welcome check of the approach advocated in this paper.\nWe also show in Fig. 3 the dependence of the inferred probability density profile\non the initial choice of the prior: the full line refers to the choice of priors described\nin Sec. 4.3, while the dashed-dotted one (dotted one) corresponds to a distribution\nfor the remainders with half widths (double widths), as compared to Table 1. As\nexpected, broader Gaussians for the NNLO remainders lead to a flatter p.d.f. for r \u2013\nthe impact of experimental information is weakened when higher orders are allowed\nto be larger. If the most probable value of r depends to some extent on the choice\nof the prior, the same is not true for the 95% lower bound, which is almost the same\nfor all distributions.\n\n\u2013 34 \u2013\n\n\f0.07\n\n0.06\n\nP(r)\n\n0.05\n\n0.04\n\n0.03\n\n0.02\n\n0.01\n\n0\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nr\n\n30\n\n35\n\nFigure 3: The probability density profile for r inferred from the \u03c0\u03c0 data (thick lines) as\ncompared to the reference one (thin dotted line). The different curves represent different\nchoices for the prior. The full line corresponds to the choice of priors indicated in the\nprevious section. The dashed-dotted line is obtained by reducing the widths for the prior\ndistributions of the remainders by a factor of two, the dotted line by increasing the widths\nby a factor of two.\n\nA comment on the so-called \"Kaplan-Manohar ambiguity\" is in order here. In\nRef. [31], it was shown that the sum of the O(p2) and O(p4 ) chiral Lagrangian\nremained unchanged under a shift in the quark masses:\nm \u2192 m + \u03bbmms ,\n\nms \u2192 ms + \u03bbm2 ,\n\n(4.41)\n\nand a corresponding redefinition of the O(p4 ) LEC's L6,7,8 . This seemingly prevents\nany determination of the quark mass ratio r. However, the Kaplan-Manohar ambiguity also induces a shift in the O(p6 ) terms included in the NNLO remainders\n(neglected in a perturbative treatment of O(p4) expansions). We have assumed a\ngood overall convergence of chiral series and therefore required small NNLO remainders, which corresponds to fixing the Kaplan-Manohar ambiguity. We point out that\nthis hypothesis is not specific to our framework, and is a fairly general assumption\nwhen dealing with chiral series.\nOn the other hand not much deviation is caused by \u03c0\u03c0 data with respect to\nthe reference profiles for X(3), Z(3) and Y (3), as is clear from Fig. 4. This is\nan indication of the fact that \u03c0\u03c0 data, as was expected, are not sensitive enough to\nX(3) and Z(3). Their determination would require the inclusion of other observables,\nwhich we discuss now.\n\n\u2013 35 \u2013\n\n\fP(X)\n\n2\n\nP(Z)\n\n1.75\n1.5\n\nP\n\n1.25\n1\n0.75\n0.5\n0.25\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1\n\nP(Y)\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\nY(3)\n\nFigure 4: The probability density profiles as inferred from the \u03c0\u03c0 data (thick lines)\ncompared to the reference one, representing the phase space (thin lines).

Other sources of constraints on X(3) and Z(3)\nWe now briefly mention some possible sources of independent experimental information about the three-flavour chiral order parameters X(3) and Z(3), or equivalently\nabout the O(p4 ) fluctuation parameters Y 2 (3)L6 and Y (3)L4 . The combination of\nO(p4 ) LEC's (\u2206L8 + 2\u2206L6 ), invariant under the Kaplan-Manohar transformation, is\nof particular interest. It appears in many observables and has remained undetermined\n\n\u2013 36 \u2013\n\n\fso far. Y 2 (3)L8 is essentially given by r through Eq. (3.9): Y 2 (3)\u2206L8 = 0.99 * 10\u22123\nfor r = 25 (where NNLO remainders are neglected). From the positivity of X(3) and\nits relation to the fluctuation parameter L6 Eq. (3.1), one gets the following upper\nbound for L6 :\nF\u03c02\n1\n[1 \u2212 \u01eb(r) \u2212 d] ,\n(5.1)\nY 2 (3)\u2206L6 \u2264\n16(r + 2) M\u03c02\nwhich implies that Y 2 (3)\u2206L6 \u2264 0.98 * 10\u22123 for r = 25 (with an expected uncertainty\nof 10 % from NNLO remainders). Between the limit of no fluctuations and that of\nmaximal fluctuations, the combination of LEC's Y 2 (3)[\u2206L8 + 2\u2206L6 ] can thus vary\nin the range:\n1.0 * 10\u22123 \u2264 Y 2 (3)[\u2206L8 + 2\u2206L6 ] \u2264 3.0 * 10\u22123\n\n[r = 25]\n\n(5.2)\n\nThis combination can be perturbatively related to the LEC l\u03043 [1] of the Nf = 2\nchiral Lagrangian; see Eq. (11.6) in Ref. [3]. In the limit of no fluctuations, l\u03043 is\na positive number of O(1); the estimate l\u03043 = 2.9 \u00b1 2.4 was obtained in Ref. [1]\nunder the assumption of the validity of the Zweig rule. If larger vacuum fluctuations\nmake Y 2 (3)[\u2206L8 + 2\u2206L6 ] increase, l\u03043 decreases towards negative values with a larger\nmagnitude. Thus, in principle, the size of vacuum fluctuations could be investigated\nthrough an accurate determination of l\u03043 obtained from \u03c0\u03c0-scattering parameters.\nUnfortunately, experimental information at such accuracy is not available due to a\nlarge uncertainty in the scattering length a20 , which is not tightly constrained by\navailable Ke4 decay experiments 7 . Therefore, we have to consider other sources of\ninformation in order to constrain the Nf = 3 order parameters.\n5.1 Goldstone boson scattering and decays\nIn order to estimate the size of vacuum fluctuations of ss\u0304 pairs, processes directly\ninvolving strange mesons are required. Before sketching how our method could be\nextended to the relevant processes, we want to comment on a few estimates of the\nO(p4 ) LEC's L4 and L6 that are available in the literature. These estimates show a\ncommon feature: they rely on the standard (perturbative) treatment of vacuum fluctuations, assuming that the latter are small, but they lead to L4 and L6 significantly\nlarger than their critical values. These estimates should therefore be considered at\nmost as valuable hints of internal inconsistency of the perturbative treatment.\nB\u00fcttiker et al. [33] have analyzed the \u03c0K \u2192 \u03c0K and \u03c0\u03c0 \u2192 K K\u0304 amplitudes,\nthereby obtaining the amplitudes at threshold and in the subthreshold region. Com7\n\nThe available \u03c0\u03c0-scattering data was analysed in Ref. [15], yielding l\u03043 = \u221218.5 \u00b1 16.7 and\nthus suggesting an important role played by vacuum fluctuations. If the experimental information\non the I = 2 channel is replaced by a theoretical constraint concerning the scalar radius of the\npion [32, 15], l\u03043 becomes a small positive number compatible with the absence of fluctuations.\n\n\u2013 37 \u2013\n\n\fparing these results with the O(p4) \u03c7PT expansion of Bernard et al. [25], they determine the LEC's Li (i = 1, 4) and the combination L8 + 2L6 :\n103 [Lr8 + 2Lr6 ](M\u03c1 ) = 3.66 \u00b1 1.52 .\n\n(5.3)\n\nThe large uncertainty quoted is reflected in the uncertainty in the scattering lengths\n1/2\n3/2\ncombination a0 + 2a0 . This could improve considerably once experimental results\nfrom \u03c0K atoms become available. However, the analysis is based on O(p4) \u03c7PT, in\nwhich the implicit assumption is made that Y (3) = 1. From our bounds Eq. (5.2),\ntaking Y (3) = 1, we obtain:\n0.27 \u2264 103 [Lr8 + 2Lr6 ](M\u03c1 ) \u2264 2.3\n\n[r = 25, Y (3) = 1] .\n\n(5.4)\n\nIt is clear that the values for L8 + 2L6 given in Ref. [33] are barely compatible\nwith the assumption of Y (3) = 1. Furthermore, the authors of Ref. [33] estimate\n103 Lr4 (M\u03c1 ) = 0.50 \u00b1 0.39, which implies 103 \u2206L4 = 1.0 \u00b1 0.39 and suggests significant violation of the Zweig rule in the scalar sector [see Eq. (3.20)]. Both remarks\ncall for a comparison of \u03c0K scattering amplitudes with a chiral expansion treating\nnonperturbatively (possibly large) vacuum fluctuations [26].\nRecently, Bijnens and Dhonte [20] have calculated the \u03c0 and K scalar form\nfactors at two loops in Nf = 3 \u03c7PT; they then fit their results to the corresponding dispersive representation based on the solution of the multi-channel Omn\u00e8sMuskhelishvili equations [5, 6]. In order to obtain \"decent fits\" for the form factors\nat zero momentum transfer, they found that the LEC's L4 and L6 had to satisfy the\nconstraint\nr\n\u22123\nLr6 (M\u03c1 ) <\n(5.5)\n\u223c 0.6 \u00d7 L4 (M\u03c1 ) + 0.4 * 10 .\n\u22123\nIf we take this to imply that [2Lr6 \u2212 Lr4 ](M\u03c1 ) <\n\u223c 0.8 * 10 , then we can rewrite the\nconstraint in terms of the fluctuation parameters \u03c1, \u03bb introduced in Sec. 3:\n\n\u03c1\u2212\u03bb <\n\u223c 1.6\n\n[r = 25] .\n\n(5.6)\n\nRecalling Eq. (3.29), the convergence of the perturbative expansion of Y (3) =\n2mB0 /M\u03c02 requires \u03c1 \u2212 \u03bb \u226a 1. Viewed in this light, the constraint of Ref. [20] is not\nsurprising: it is simply the observation that the authors, within their perturbative\nanalysis, cannot find a good fit to a perturbative \u03c7PT expansion in the presence of\nlarge vacuum fluctuations. In addition, they find that requiring the values of the\nscalar form factors at zero not deviate too much from their lowest order values leads\nto the estimate 0.3 \u2264 103 Lr4 (M\u03c1 ) \u2264 0.6. Note that this result is roughly in agreement\nwith that of Ref. [33] discussed above. According to Table 2 of Ref. [20], this value\nof L4 leads to a suppression of Z(3) down to half of Z(2), as can be checked from\nEq. (3.1). All these considerations suggest sizeable vacuum fluctuations in the scalar\nsector.\n\n\u2013 38 \u2013\n\n\fWe outline now how additional observables coming from Goldstone boson scattering and decay could be incorporated naturally in the Bayesian machinery, in order\nto constrain the size of vacuum fluctuations, or equivalently X(3) and Z(3). The\nmost obvious candidate is \u03c0K scattering. The first step consists in using analyticity, unitarity, crossing symmetry in conjunction with experimental data in order\nto constrain as much as possible the low-energy \u03c0K-scattering amplitude [33]. The\nsecond stage corresponds to an analysis similar to that in the case of \u03c0\u03c0 scattering:\nestablish a dispersive representation of the amplitude with subthreshold parameters\n(i.e., subtraction constants like \u03b1\u03c0\u03c0 and \u03b2\u03c0\u03c0 ), determine the value of these parameters from experiment, then include these parameters as additional observables for\nthe Bayesian analysis. The expected outcome should be more stringent constraints\non X(3) and Z(3) [26].\nThe decay \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 is a second process of interest [34]. The standard treatment of\nthis decay starts with the ratio A\u03b7\u21923\u03c0 /\u2206K , where A\u03b7\u21923\u03c0 is the decay amplitude and\n\u2206K = (MK2 + \u2212 MK2 0 )QCD . This ratio is then perturbatively reexpressed in terms of\nGoldstone boson masses and a single O(p4 ) LEC L3 . As stressed previously, a bare\nchiral expansion of ratios of QCD correlation functions that are only conditionally\nconvergent may exhibit instabilities. To cope with possibly large vacuum fluctuations, a better starting point could be the expansion of the quantity F\u03c03 F\u03b7 A\u03b7\u21923\u03c0 ,\nwhich is linearly related to a QCD correlation function. Such an expansion will involve more LEC's and order parameters and allow the extraction of the latter from\nthe data. Since the decay \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 is forbidden in the isospin limit mu = md , we\nmust start by extending the previous discussion of Goldstone boson masses and decay\nconstants to include isospin breaking. A dispersive representation of the amplitude\nA\u03b7\u21923\u03c0 must then be written to define convenient observables. The dispersion relations are here more involved than in the case of \u03c0\u03c0- and \u03c0K-scattering: they require\nstudying \u03b7\u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 and performing subsequently an analytical continuation to the\n(physical) decay channel. The observables thus defined, related to the behaviour of\nthe decay amplitude at the center of the Dalitz plot (via slope parameters), can be\nexploited in our Bayesian framework in order to constrain further three-flavour chiral\norder parameters and to extract the quark mass ratios mu /ms and md /ms .\n5.2 Two-point functions and sum rules\nIn this paper, our aim was in particular to pin down X(3), i.e., the Nf = 3 chiral\ncondensate measured in physical units, which governs the behaviour of QCD correlation functions in the limit mu = md = ms = 0. Related though different quantities\narise when the high-energy limit of the same correlation functions is studied through\nthe operator product expansion (OPE). Local condensates appear then, and those\nwith the lowest dimension are:\n\u03a3u = \u2212h0|\u016bu|0i ,\n\n \u0304\n\u03a3d = \u2212h0|dd|0i\n,\n\n\u2013 39 \u2013\n\n\u03a3s = \u2212h0|s\u0304s|0i ,\n\n(5.7)\n\n\fwhere the physical vacuum of the theory is denoted |0i with all the quarks carrying\ntheir physical masses: no chiral limit is taken.\nThese OPE quark condensates occur in various sum rules for two-point correlators and could thus be determined in this framework [35]. First, they arise (multiplied\nby a mass term) in the high-energy tail of the correlators as dimension-4 operators.\n(For example, see [36] for the case of pseudoscalar densities.) Next, in some sum\nrules, normal-ordered condensates of the type (5.7) appear through chiral Ward\nidentities. For instance, in the case of the divergence of the strangeness-changing\nvector current [37, 38], the strange-quark mass is determined via a sum rule with\nno subtraction, but another sum rule can be written with the subtraction constant\n(ms \u2212 mu )(\u03a3s \u2212 \u03a3u ), providing in principle some information on the OPE quark condensates. Unfortunately, the high-energy tail of the (Borel transformed) two-point\nfunction involved in this case has a QCD expansion which behaves quite badly and\nprevents any accurate determination. Lastly, the OPE quark condensates arise when\nfactorisation is invoked to reexpress higher-dimensional four-quark operators as the\nsquare of q\u0304q vacuum expectation values.\nWe stress that the OPE quark condensates \u03a3u , \u03a3d , \u03a3s have a different definition\n(and thus value) from the chiral condensates that we have considered here and in\nRef. [15]:\n\u03a3(2) \u2261 \u2212\n\nmu ,md \u21920\n\n\u03a3(3) \u2261 \u2212\n\nmu ,md ,ms \u21920\n\n=\n\nlim h0|\u016bu|0i =\nlim\n\nlim\n\nmu ,md ,ms \u21920\n\nlim\n\nmu ,md \u21920\n\n\u03a3u =\n\nlim\n\nmu ,md \u21920\n\n\u03a3d ,\n\n(5.8)\n\nh0|\u016bu|0i\n\n\u03a3u =\n\nlim\n\nmu ,md ,ms \u21920\n\n\u03a3d =\n\nlim\n\nmu ,md ,ms \u21920\n\n\u03a3s .\n\n(5.9)\n\nIn particular, \u03a3u , \u03a3d , \u03a3s exhibit an ultraviolet divergence that must be renormalized;\ntherefore, their definition and their value depend on the convention applied. It is\npossible to relate them to \u03a3(3) using Nf = 3 \u03c7PT. For instance, if we take Eq. (9.1)\nin Ref.

First, for r larger than 15,\nEq. (5.13) shows that Xu,d is close to [1 \u2212 \u01eb(r) \u2212 d], while we see from Eq. (4.1)\nthat X(2)(1 \u2212 d\u0304\u03c0 ) equals [1 \u2212 \u01eb(r) \u2212 d] up to 1/r-suppressed corrections. \u03a3u,d should\nthus be very close to \u03a3(2), which was expected since the u, d quarks are very light\nand the physical world is near the Nf = 2 chiral limit.\nThe second conclusion is that Xs \u2212 Xu,d can hardly be obtained from such a\nrelation, since Xu,d and 1\u2212\u01eb(r)\u2212d largely cancel. Thus, very accurate knowledge of r\nand Xu,d would be needed to determine Xs this way. More generally, the possibility of\nsignificant vacuum fluctuations of ss\u0304 pairs makes it difficult to relate in a quantitative\nway \u03a3(3) and the OPE quark condensates \u03a3ud , \u03a3s .\nSuch a relation between OPE and chiral quark condensates is naturally relevant\nfor the description of K-decays. In particular, some K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 weak matrix elements\nare related to v.e.v.'s of four-quark operators in the Nf = 3 chiral limit, thanks to\nsum rules for vector-axial or scalar-pseudoscalar correlators [39]. These sum rules are\nevaluated by splitting the integral in two energy domains: the low-energy region is\ndescribed by experimental data, while the high-energy behaviour is obtained through\nthe operator product expansion, which involves a priori OPE quark condensates.\nHowever, since the sum rules are evaluated in the chiral limit mu = md = ms \u2192 0,\nthese condensates actually reduce to the Nf = 3 chiral condensate \u03a3(3).\nThe dispersive estimates of K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 matrix elements could thus be affected\nat three different stages by significant vacuum fluctuations of ss\u0304 pairs leading to\nsmaller values of \u03a3(3). Firstly, extrapolating the weak matrix elements from the\nNf = 3 chiral limit to the physical values of the u, d, s-quarks could not be carried\nout on the basis of the usual treatment and values of LEC's of Nf = 3 \u03c7PT, since\nthe latter assume from the start a leading contribution from \u03a3(3). Moreover, the\nvery estimate of the sum rule could be modified because of the change in the highenergy behaviour of the correlator in the chiral limit. The third question concerns\n\n\u2013 41 \u2013\n\n\fdimension-6 four-quark condensates, which appear at higher orders of OPE and are\noften related to the square of a q\u0304q condensate through factorisation, on the basis\nof large-Nc arguments. The presence of large q q\u0304 fluctuations might render such an\nassumption invalid.\n5.3 Implications for lattice simulations\nIn principle, the lattice should represent a particularly favourable domain to study\nhow QCD at low energy depends on the light-quark masses and how this dependence\nis connected to the vacuum fluctuations of q q\u0304 pairs. Recent progress has been made\nin this field. Discretisations of the Dirac operator have been discovered with highly\ndesirable qualities for the simulation of light quarks. In particular, Ginsparg-Wilson\nfermions [40] do not break chiral symmetry explicitly. A second (cheaper) option\nconsists in twisted-mass lattice QCD [41], where a parametrized rotation of the mass\nmatrix allows one to restore chiral symmetry partially in observables through an\naveraging procedure. Another avenue is provided by staggered fermions [42], which\nallows one to study an odd number of flavours, at the cost of introducing unwanted\nflavour degeneracies.\nVacuum fluctuations of q q\u0304 pairs are typical sea-quark effects. The fermionic\ndeterminant plays here an essential role, since we are interested in chiral parameters\ndominated by the infrared end of the Dirac spectrum [10, 11]. In order to study these\neffects on the lattice, it is therefore mandatory to generate data for 3 dynamical\nflavours. For this particular purpose, one cannot rely on quenched data (with no\ndynamical quark) or on data generated with only two dynamical quarks \u2013 even\nthough they can be of interest for observables relatively insensitive to the fermion\ndeterminant, e.g., M\u03c1 .\nWe will now illustrate, by considering \"bare\" expansions of \"good\" observables\nsuch as F\u03c02 M\u03c02 and F\u03c02 , how lattice data could probe vacuum fluctuations of q q\u0304 pairs\nand how chiral extrapolations should be dealt with if the latter turn out to be significant. We consider a slightly optimistic situation where lattice data with reasonable\naccuracy can be generated for 3 light dynamical flavours. For simplicity, we choose\nto work in the limit of degenerate strange and light quark masses. The analysis could\nbe done for independent variations of the quark masses, but the attendant complications do not add anything essential to our conclusions. Moreover, it is likely that\nrealistic lattice calculations are more easily performed in this simplified situation. On\nthe lattice, we denote by mL the common mass of the three degenerate light flavours,\nand by ML2 and FL2 the common mass and decay constant of the eight degenerate\nGoldstone bosons. We keep m and ms for the physical values of the quarks and\nF\u03c02 , M\u03c02 . . . for the physical values of Goldstone boson observables.\nThe observables FL2 and FL2 ML2 have thus the form\nh\n1\nML2 i\n2\n2\n2\n2 2\nFL ML = 2mL B0 F0 + 64mL B0 3L6 (\u03bc) + L8 (\u03bc) \u2212\n,\nlog 2 + FL2 ML2 dL(5.14)\n96\u03c0 2\n\u03bc\n\n\u2013 42 \u2013\n\n\fh\nFL2 = F02 + 16mL B0 3L4 (\u03bc) + L5 (\u03bc) \u2212\n\n3\nML2 i\nlog\n+ FL2 eL ,\n128\u03c0 2\n\u03bc2\n\n(5.15)\n\nwhere the remainders dL , eL are of order m2L .\nSince B0 , F0 and the LEC's Li are all defined in the Nf = 3 chiral limit and are\nthus independent of the quark masses, we may use Eqs. (3.30)-(3.36) to eliminate\nthem in favour of the real-world parameters X(3), Y (3), Z(3), r and the physical\nvalues of the masses and couplings of the Goldstone bosons, leading to:\no\nF\u03c02 M\u03c02 n\n\u2032\n3[1 \u2212 X(3) \u2212 d] + (r \u2212 1)[\u01eb(r) + d ]\n=\n+b\nr+2\nn\n\u0010\nM\u03b72 \u0011\nMK2\n1\n+\nlog\n+2b2 M\u03c04 Y (3)2 \u2212\n3\nlog\n32\u03c0 2 (r + 2)\nM\u03c02\nMK2\nM\u03b72 \u0011o\n1 \u0010\nMK2\n1\n+\nlog\nlog\n+\n+ FL2 ML2 dL ,\n(5.16)\n16\u03c0 2\nML2\n3\nML2\nn\no\n1\nF\u03c02 3[1 \u2212 Z(3) \u2212 e] + (r \u2212 1)[\u03b7(r) + e\u2032 ]\nFL2 = F\u03c02 Z(3) + b\nr+2\n2\nM\u03b72\nMK2 \u0011\nM\u03c0 Y (3) h 1 \u0010\n3 log 2 + 7 log 2\n\u2212b\n32\u03c0 2 r + 2\nMK\nM\u03c0\n2\n\u0011i\n\u0010\n2\nM\u03b7\nM\n+ FL2 eL ,\n(5.17)\n\u22122 log 2 + 2 log K2\nML\nML\n\nFL2 ML2\n\nb F\u03c02 M\u03c02 X(3)\n\n2\n\nTaking the ratio of these equations gives ML2 implicitly as a function of b = mL /m.\nThe remainders d, e enter the resulting expressions multiplied by a factor of b/r; we\nwill ignore them as well as the 1/r-suppressed contributions from d\u2032 , e\u2032 .\nSince the chiral expansion requires small values of mL , while present day lattice\nsimulations prefer mL on the order of ms , it is important to ascertain if there is a\nrange of variation for mL in which our equations may be applied and still give valuable results. There are two different conditions to be met. First, as mL increases, the\ndegenerate mass ML increases, eventually exceeding MK , M\u03b7 ; this in itself is of concern, since the chiral expansion becomes unreliable as ML approaches values typical\nof relevant hadronic resonances. In addition, the terms logarithmic in ML2 become\nnegative and eventually the procedure described above is unstable. Therefore, we\nwill restrict the range of variation of mL so that these logarithmic terms do not contribute more than 25% of the total. This stability criterion constrains the allowed\nregion in the space of parameters X(3), Z(3), r, mL; however, this region includes\nvalues of interest. For example, in Fig. 5 we show the allowed region in X(3), mL /m\nfor the illustrative choice Z(3) = 0.6, r = 25. For mL /m \u2264 20, all values of X(3) are\npossible. As can be seen in Fig. 6, with such a constraint on mL /m, we satisfy also\nthe first requirement since ML does not exceed 1.5 * MK .\nFor values of Z(3) between 0.4 and 0.8 and of r between 20 and 30, we find\nthat the allowed region does not qualitatively change: so long as we keep mL /m less\n\n\u2013 43 \u2013\n\n\f1\nDecay cst\nMass\n\n0.8\n\nX(3)\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\nb\nFigure 5: Stability criterion for Z(3) = 0.6, r = 25. Inside the circle in full line [dashed\nline], the term logarithmic in ML contributes more than 25% to FL2 [FL2 ML2 ]. All NNLO\nremainders are set to zero.\n\nthan 20, then all values of X(3) are permitted according to our stability criterion.\nConsider, then, the variation of FL2 and of FL2 ML2 as functions of mL , for fixed Z(3)\nand r, as shown in Figs. 7 and 8 in the illustrative case Z(3) = 0.6, r = 25. From\nEqs. (5.16)-(5.17), the general dependence on X(3) is apparent: the X(3)-dependence\nmust vanish for small b = mL /m as well as for b = mL /m \u223c (r + 2)/3 \u223c 10 (apart\nfrom a residual dependence from the logarithms). Therefore, the region of interest\nis 10 \u2264 b \u2264 20. Fortunately, even in this restricted interval, there is considerable\ndependence on X(3), especially for FL2 ML2 /b. A good knowledge of the spectrum\nin this range would allow us to discriminate at least between the most extreme\npossibilities (X(3) close to X(2), X(3) close to 0)8 . We stress that not all the\nobservables are equivalent for this study: for instance, ML2 exhibits a much weaker\nsensitivity to vacuum fluctuations, as shown in Fig. 6. This cancellation between L6\n8\n\nA first step in this direction was proposed by considering the dependence on m and ms of the\nGoldstone boson masses to extract the values of some low-energy constants for partially quenched\nstaggered fermions [43]. However, this was achieved by relying on the chiral expansion of MP2 , with a\nperturbative reexpression of the fundamental parameters r, X(3), Z(3) in terms of Goldstone boson\nmasses. Moreover, the O(p4 ) LEC's L4 and L6 related to the vacuum fluctuations were eliminated\nthrough a perturbative redefinition of the parameters involved in the chiral series. As discussed in\nSecs. 2 and 3, this procedure need not be correct in the case of large vacuum fluctuations.\n\n\u2013 44 \u2013\n\n\f50\n\n30\n\n(M L/M\u03c0 )\n\n2\n\n40\n\n20\nX(3)=0.3\nX(3)=0.4\nX(3)=0.5\nX(3)=0.6\nX(3)=0.7\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\nb\nFigure 6: ML2 /M\u03c02 as a function of b = mL /m for Z(3) = 0.6, r = 25.

All NNLO remainders are set to zero.\n\nWe have not included the NNLO remainders dL and eL here, but it is a straightforward exercise to take them into account. We can check their size by writing them\nin the following form:\nF\u03c02 M\u03c02 d\u03c0 = m2s mD1 + ms m2 D2 + m3 D3 ,\nF\u03c02 e\u03c0 = m2s E1 + ms mE2 + m2 E3 ,\n\n(5.18)\n\nwhere Di and Ei do contain O(p6 ) LEC's and chiral logarithms. If we neglect the\ndependence of the chiral logarithms on the quark masses when they vary from m, ms\nto mL , the same quantities will appear in the analogous expression for FL2 ML2 dL , FL2 eL :\ni\nh bF 2 M 2 i b2 h D + D + D\ndL\n1\n2\n3\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n,\n=\nd\u03c0\nFL2 ML2 r 2 D1 + D2 /r + D3 /r 2\ni\nh F 2 i b2 h E + E + E\neL\n1\n2\n3\n\u03c0\n.\n=\ne\u03c0\nFL2 r 2 E1 + E2 /r + E3 /r 2\n\n(5.19)\n\nWe can check easily that the first factor is of order one in each case (see for instance\nFigs. 7 and 8). Therefore, we conclude that the remainders dL , eL are expected to\nbe of order m2L , i.e., of order 0.1 * b2 /r 2 (i.e., 10 % or less). Once the remainders are\nincluded, an accurate determination of Z(3) is quite difficult because FL2 does not\nexhibit a strong sensitivity to the latter. But X(3) is still accessible because of the\nstrong variation in the curvature of FL2 ML2 as a function of b.\n\n\u2013 46 \u2013\n\n\f6. Summary and conclusion\nThe large-Nc suppressed low-energy constants Lr4 (\u03bc) and Lr6 (\u03bc) encode fluctuations\nof vacuum s\u0304s pairs. We have analysed the influence of these fluctuations on the\nconvergence of Nf = 3 \u03c7PT.\ni) For the physical value of ms , we assume a global (though possibly slow) convergence of the SU(3) \u00d7 SU(3) chiral expansion applied to low-energy connected\nQCD correlation functions and to observables that are linearly related to the\nlatter: typical examples are FP2 , FP2 MP2 , F\u03c04 A\u03c0\u03c0\u2192\u03c0\u03c0 , F\u03c02 FK2 A\u03c0K\u2192\u03c0K , etc. For\nsuch quantities, the bare expansion (as defined in Sec. 2) expressed in terms of\nthe order parameters \u03a3(3) and F0 and in powers of quark masses mu , md , ms\nis likely characterised by relatively small higher-order corrections starting at\nNNLO.\nii) Vacuum fluctuations of s\u0304s pairs affect in particular the next-to-leading-order\n(NLO) contributions to F\u03c02 M\u03c02 and F\u03c02 through terms ms L6 and ms L4 , which\nappear in \u03c7PT with large coefficients. They reflect Zweig-rule violation and\nlarge 1/Nc corrections in the scalar channel. Unless L6 and L4 are very precisely\n\u22123\ncrit\n\u22123\ntuned to their critical values Lcrit\n6 (M\u03c1 ) = \u22120.26 * 10 , L4 (M\u03c1 ) = \u22120.51 * 10 ,\nthe vacuum fluctuation NLO contribution to F\u03c02 M\u03c02 and/or to F\u03c02 becomes\nof comparable size or even larger than the corresponding leading-order (LO)\ncontributions given by the three-flavour condensate \u03a3(3) and by the pion decay\nconstant F02 . In this case, the expansions of X(3) = 2m\u03a3(3)/F\u03c02 M\u03c02 and Z(3) =\nF02 /F\u03c02 in powers of ms break down despite the convergence of F\u03c02 M\u03c02 and F\u03c02 .\nAs a result, X(3) and Z(3), which measure Nf = 3 order parameters in physical\nunits, could be suppressed well below one, implying an instability of Nf = 3\n\u03c7PT.\niii) The instability due to vacuum fluctuations upsets the standard perturbative\nreexpression of the lowest order parameters \u03a3(3) and F02 as well as quark masses\nin favour of an expansion in terms of physical Goldstone boson masses, F\u03c0\nand FK . Instead, using the four mass and decay constant Ward identities, we\nnonperturbatively eliminate the LEC's L4 , L5 , L6 , (L7 ), L8 in terms of the order\nparameters X(3) and Z(3) , the quark mass ratio r = ms /m and four NNLO\nremainders d\u03c0 , dK , e\u03c0 , eK which collect all higher-order contributions starting\nat O(p6 ). This procedure amounts to an exact resummation of the standard\nperturbative reexpression of X(3), Z(3) and r and it applies even if the vacuum\nfluctuations suppress X(3) and/or Z(3).\niv) In this way, values of the basic order parameters X(3), Z(3) and the quark mass\nratio r can be constrained by experimental data as long as NNLO remainders\n\n\u2013 47 \u2013\n\n\fare under control. In order to gradually incorporate theoretical conjectures\nabout the order parameters X(3) and Z(3) (e.g., their positivity, paramagnetic\ninequalities), and on higher chiral orders (i.e., NNLO remainders), we propose\nto use Bayesian statistical inference. In this approach, previous knowledge of\nparameters is encoded into the prior probability distribution function. At this\nstep, some degree of arbitrariness is introduced, but the dependence on the\nchoice of the prior is guaranteed to be weak if data are significant enough.\nv) We have applied this procedure to the three-flavour analysis of elastic \u03c0\u03c0 scattering, in order to test the ability of the recent high-precision low-energy data\nobtained by the E865 Collaboration [14] to constrain three-flavour chiral dynamics. We have shown that, for the present state of experimental precision,\nthe data cannot determine the two fundamental Nf = 3 chiral order parameters\nX(3) and Z(3). However, the low-energy \u03c0\u03c0 data is sufficient for us to put a\nquantitative lower bound on the quark mass ratio r = ms /m \u2265 14 at the 95%\nconfidence level, and to determine the corresponding probability distribution\nfunction.\nvi) The Bayesian machinery is suitable for incrementally including further experimental information on low-energy observables, and seems especially welladapted in this context, in view of an extension of our analysis to valence\ns-quark effects. In particular, \u03c0K scattering appears to be rather promising,\ndue to recent progress obtained through the solution of the corresponding RoySteiner equations [33]. We plan to address this issue in future publications [26].\nvii) The possible instability of Nf = 3 chiral expansions, and the prescription\nexamined in this paper to treat it, are also relevant in other respects. One\nexample is the evaluation of K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 weak matrix elements from sum rules\nbased on OPE: in particular, the extrapolation of the OPE condensate from the\nchiral limit to physical values of quark masses would not be possible on the basis\nof the usual treatment of Nf = 3 \u03c7PT formulas. A similar remark applies to the\nstudy of the quark mass dependence of Goldstone boson masses on the lattice\nand to determinations of the LEC's by this means. We have shown how such a\nprogram could be pursued even in the presence of large fluctuations, provided\nsimulations with three dynamical flavours would be available with quark masses\nas small as the physical strange quark mass. It remains to be seen whether\nsuch simulations, with proper control of the continuum and thermodynamic\nlimits, will be feasible in the near future.\nviii) In order to detect possibly large s\u0304s fluctuations, another strategy is conceivable:\none might calculate and analyse as many quantities as possible within the\nstandard SU(3)\u00d7SU(3) \u03c7PT, up to and including two loops, using the standard\n\n\u2013 48 \u2013\n\n\fperturbative reexpression of low-energy parameters [17, 20].

We have also introduced\nthe NNLO remainders d\u03b7 and e\u03b7 of order O(m2q ).\n\nB. \u03c7PT and Bayesian statistical analysis\nOne of the main achievements of SU(3)\u00d7SU(3) chiral perturbation theory consists in\nproviding a consistent framework that includes all the constraints of chiral symmetry\nwhen one analyses processes involving the Goldstone bosons \u03c0, K, \u03b7. This allows one\nto express observables as expansions in powers of momenta and quark masses up to\na given order. Each order involves new low-energy constants whose values cannot\nbe determined from chiral constraints, but nevertheless provide very much needed\ninsight into the mechanism of chiral symmetry breaking.\nWe would like therefore to pin down (or at least constrain) LEC's arising at first\norder in SU(3) \u00d7 SU(3) chiral expansions \u2013 for instance, the quark condensate and\nthe pseudoscalar decay constant in the limit mu , md , ms \u2192 0 \u2013 by using available\nexperimental information.\nWe must therefore combine several sources of information:\n\u2022 Experimental measurements of observables \u03b1i : Pjexp (\u03b1i )\nTheir values have (possibly correlated) uncertainties which are described by\nprobability distributions. In the theoretical basis that underlies the determination of these observables no use of \u03c7PT should have been made. For instance,\nsolutions of Roy equations were required in addition to experimental phase\n\n\u2013 50 \u2013\n\n\fshifts to extract \u03c0\u03c0 scattering parameters. As explained in Sec. 2.3, a reasonable choice of observables can be derived from QCD correlation functions of\ncurrents and densities, away from kinematic singularities; e.g., one may choose\n\u03c0\u03c0 subthreshold parameters.\n\u2022 Relations between the observables and theoretical parameters Tn : \u03b1i = Ai (Tn )\nWe have explained how mass and decay constant identities can be used to\neliminate some O(p4 ) LEC's in chiral expansions of observables. We have\nchosen the theoretical parameters to be X(3), Z(3), r, and remainders that\ncomprise NNLO and higher order corrections.\n\u2022 Theoretical constraints/assumptions about the values of Tn : Ck (Tn )\nChiral order parameters are constrained: for instance, vacuum stability requires\nX(3) \u2265 0, whereas Z(3) is positive by definition. We have also theoretical\nprejudices about NNLO remainders if we require an overall convergence of\nchiral expansions: the relative contribution of NNLO remainders must remain\nsmall.\nIt is quite easy from these elements to construct the likelihood function\nY exp\nL(Tn ) = P (data|Tn , H) =\nPj [Ai (Tn )] ,\n\n(B.1)\n\nj\n\nwhich is the probability of obtaining the observed data once a particular set of\ntheoretical parameters is given (within the theoretical framework H). However, what\nwe want is not L, but rather the reverse quantity P (Tn |data, H), i.e., the probability\nof having a particular set of theoretical parameters, taking into account the data.\nThis problem of \"statistical inference\" has a long history. A possible solution is\nprovided by Bayesian analysis [22], which relies on Bayes' theorem:\nP (Tn |data, H) = R\n\nL(Tn ) * \u03c0(Tn |H)\n,\n[dT ] L(Tn ) * \u03c0(Tn |H)\n\n(B.2)\n\nwhere \u03c0 is the \"prior\" distribution, i.e., the probability associated with the theoretical\nparameters before the experimental results have been taken in consideration:\nY\n\u03c0(Tn ) = P (Tn |H) =\nCk (Tn ) .\n(B.3)\nk\n\nThe denominator on the right-hand side of Eq. (B.2) is just a normalisation factor.\nThe marginal probability associated with a given theoretical parameter is obtained by\nintegrating the joint probability P (Tn |data, H) over all other theoretical parameters.\nLet us mention that there is some arbitrariness in each of these ingredients. We\ncould have chosen other observables, such as combinations of scattering lengths in\n\n\u2013 51 \u2013\n\n\fwhich one-loop chiral logarithms cancel [32]. We could have added all O(p4 ) LEC's\nto the set of theoretical parameters, and kept \"bare\" chiral expansions as relations\namong the observables. Finally, we could have computed O(p6 ) contributions to\nNNLO remainders and used resonance saturation to estimate the size of the remainders, following the procedure in Ref. [17].\nIn the present paper we have advocated a particular choice of observables as\nconstituting a sensible starting point for a Bayesian analysis of data from \u03c0\u03c0 and\n\u03c0K scattering. Other choices of prior p.d.f's for the theoretical parameters (especially\nfor the NNLO remainders) can be considered, as long as they are well motivated.\nHowever, the posterior probabilities should not be strongly sensitive to the choice of\npriors when a sufficient amount of experimental data is included in the analysis.\n\nC. Integration procedure for the analysis of \u03c0\u03c0 scattering\nIn Sec. 4, we apply Bayesian methods to perform a three-flavour analysis of \u03c0\u03c0 scattering, constructing a joint probability P (r, Y, Z, ~\u03b4|data). This gives the probability\nof having a particular choice of quark mass ratio r, order parameters Y (3) and Z(3)\nand NNLO remainders \u03b4i=1...7 , once \u03c0\u03c0 scattering data is taken into account. By\nintegrating over NNLO remainders, we obtain the joint probability\nZ Y\n7\nP (r, Y, Z|data) =\nd\u03b4i P (r, Y, Z, ~\u03b4|data)\n(C.1)\ni=1\n\n\u221d \u03c0(Y, Z) \u03b8(r \u2212 r1 ) \u03b8(r2 \u2212 r) \u03b8[Z(3)] \u03b8[Y (3)]\nZ \u03b41max Z \u03b42max Z\nZ\nZ\n\u00d7\nd\u03b41\nd\u03b42\nd\u03b46\nd\u03b47 d\u03b43 d\u03b44 d\u03b45\n\u03b46min\n\n\u03b47min\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n7\nY\n1 T\n\u00d7\nG(\u03b4i , \u03c3i ) exp \u2212 V CV \u03b8[Y max \u2212 Y (3)] ,\n2\ni=1\n\n(C.2)\n\nwhere \u221d means \"equals, up to a (numerical) normalization coefficient\", C is the\nerror matrix for the experimental data, Eq.

We restrict the integration over the remainders \u03b41,2,3 to the\nrange [\u22125\u03c3i , 5\u03c3i ] (the upper bound can be smaller for i = 1, 2 due to the positivity\nconstraints Eqs. (4.26)-(4.27)). The range of integration for the two parameters that\nremain to be integrated is given by the theoretical constraints discussed in Sec. 4.\nIn order to appreciate the impact of data in the Bayesian framework, it is quite\ninteresting to consider the marginal probabilities obtained when no experimental\ninformation is included. In our particular case, this amounts to replacing the experimental distribution Pexp (\u03b1, \u03b2) by 1, or equivalently to setting the matrix C to 0. We\nobtain then the following p.d.f:\nP0 (r, Y, Z|data) \u221d \u03c0(Y, Z) \u03b8(r \u2212 r1 ) \u03b8(r2 \u2212 r) \u03b8[Z(3)] \u03b8[Y (3)]\nZ \u03b41max Z \u03b42max Z\n3\nY\n\u00d7\nd\u03b41\nd\u03b42 d\u03b43\nG(\u03b4i , \u03c3i )\u03b8[Y max \u2212 Y (3)]\ni=1\n\n\u0014\n\n\u00d7 1 \u2212 Erf\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b46min\n\n\u0013\u0015 \u0014\n\u0012 min \u0013\u0015\n\u03b4\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 Erf \u221a7\n.\n2\u03c36\n2\u03c37\n\n(C.8)\n\nP0 is just the normalized prior p.d.f, and corresponds to the \"phase space\" allowed by\nthe theoretical constraints and assumptions on the various parameters.
