The PHENIX experiment has shown that J/\u03c8s are suppressed in central Au+Au collisions at a\n\u221a\ncenter of mass energy per nucleon-nucleon collision sNN = 200 GeV, and that the suppression is larger\nat forward than at mid-rapidity. Part of this difference may be explained by cold nuclear matter effects\nbut the most central collisions suggest that regeneration mechanisms could be at play. In 2007, PHENIX\ncollected almost four times more Au+Au collisions at this energy than used for previous published results.\nMoreover, the addition of a new reaction plane detector allows a much better analysis of the J/\u03c8 behavior\nin the azimuthal plane. Since a large elliptic flow has been measured for open charm, measuring J/\u03c8\nazimuthal anisotropies may give a hint if J/\u03c8 are recombined in the expanding matter.

The MuID, made of Iarroci tubes and steel\nabsorbers, allows the identification of the muons through\ntheir penetration depth. The MuTr is made of cathode\nstrip chambers that measure the particles momentum through\ntheir bending in a magnetic field. The muon spectrometers\nhave a rapidity coverage for single muons of |\u03b7| \u2208 [1.2\u22122.2]\nwhich overlaps with the RxnP acceptance (|\u03b7| \u2208 [1 \u2212 2.8]).\nTo eliminate possible bias from radiated gluons accompanying J/\u03c8s at similar rapidity, only the RxnP detector\nopposite to the arm where the muons go is used in this\nanalysis.\n\n3 Analysis Method\nFig. 1.

Until 2007 the collision reaction plane\nwas measured in PHENIX by using Beam-Beam counters\n(BBC). In 2007 a new reaction plane detector (RxnP) was\ninstalled. It allows two times better precision on the reaction plane measurement, as shown in Figure 2. The resolution by which the reaction plane angle is measured is\nused as a correction to the measured v2 to account for the\nfinite precision of the reaction plane measurement.\n\nThe integrated luminosity used for the analysis for this\nresult is 537 \u03bcb\u22121 (611 \u03bcb\u22121 ) at negative (positive) rapidity, which is almost four times more than in the previous\npublications [15]. This analysis is performed on an onlinefiltered data sample which enabled results very soon after\nthe data was taken. The online filtering was based on fast\ntracking in the MuID and has no effect on the v2 derived\nhere.\nThe elliptic flow is obtained by dividing J/\u03c8s into only\ntwo \u03c6\u2212\u03c8 bins: ]0,\u03c0/4] and ]\u03c0/4,\u03c0/2]. v2 is then calculated\nby comparing the number of J/\u03c8s that belong to the bin\nwhich contains the reaction plane, N in , with those that\nare in the bin which does not contain the reaction plane\nN out , following the formulae:\nv2meas =\n\n\u03c0 (N in \u2212 N out )\n*\n4 (N in + N out )\n\n(2)\n\nRP\n\n<cos(2\u2206\u03c8 )>\n\nwith uncertainty,\n0.8\n\n\u03c3v2meas =\n\n0.7\n0.6\n\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n\nRxnP (top)\nMPC (middle)\nBBC (bottom)\n\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90 100\n\nCentrality (%)\n\nFig. 2.

Larger values correspond to higher precision in the\nreaction plane determination.\n\nAt forward rapidity, J/\u03c8s are measured through their\ndecay into di-muons with two spectrometers, one on each\nside of the interaction point. Each spectrometer is composed of muon identification (MuID) and tracking (MuTr)\n\n(N in\n\np\n\u03c0/2\n* (N out \u03c3 in )2 + (N in \u03c3 out )2 (3)\nout\n2\n+N )\n\nwhere \u03c3 in is the error on N in and \u03c3 out is the error\non N out . Finally, v2meas is divided by the reaction plane\nresolution in order to get the true J/\u03c8 v2 as described\nin [13].\nSince the background subtraction is critical for the\nv2 measurement, improvement on the subtraction method\nhas been made for this analysis. Previously, a mixed-event\nsubtraction technique was used to extract the J/\u03c8 signal\nin a high background environment [15]. This method accounts for the fact that the MuTr acceptance differs for\nlike-sign (++or\u2212\u2212) and unlike-sign (+\u2212) muon pairs and\nimproves the statistical errors for bins where the signal\nover background is poor. The invariant mass distribution\nusing the mixed-event subtraction for the 20-60% centrality range is shown in Figure 3. The signal fit seems to be\naccurate, but the spectrum is distorted for masses below\n2.6 GeV/c2 . The distortions originate from a bias introduced by the online filtering which creates a difference in\nthe mixed-event (M ixed) and same-event (F G) distributions. To account for this bias, we use both like-sign and\nmixed-event distributions as follow:\nM ixed+\u2212\n(4)\nF G+\u2212 \u2212 F G++or\u2212\u2212 *\nM ixed++or\u2212\u2212\n\n\fCatherine Silvestre: J/\u03c8 v2 at forward rapidity in Au+Au collisions by PHENIX\n\nThe like-sign distributions help correcting for acceptance\neffects caused by the online filtering and the mixed-event\ndistributions allow to reproduce a statistics unlimited background.\nThe mass spectrum obtained with the combined subtraction is shown in Figure 4. The low mass distortions\nare highly reduced and the residual background below the\nJ/\u03c8 peak should also be reduced. On the other hand, this\nmethod results \u221a\nin statistical errors that are larger by a\nfactor of about 2 due to the use of the unlike-sign sameevent distributions.\n\n800\n\n3\n\nrapidity symmetry allows one to average the two measurements. The averaged result is shown by the magenta\nclosed circles in Figure 6. The error bars on the two figures\naccount for statistical and point-to-point uncorrelated errors. They come from the statistical uncertainty on the\nnumber of signal counts [15], and the systematic uncertainty of the signal counting and background line shapes.\nThe boxes represent point-to-point correlated errors that\naccount for the error on the average RxnP detector resolution and the error on the J/\u03c8 \u03c6 angle measurement (least\naccurate for pT < 1 GeV/c).

In addition the methods to extract v2 are also different and thus so are the uncertainties. At mid-rapidity,\nthe point-to-point correlated systematic uncertainties are\ndominated by the unknown shape of the background v2 .\nAt forward rapidity, only corrections for the finite precision of the reaction plane measurement and \u03c6 angle matter, after the total subtraction of the background. Forward\nand mid-rapidity measurements are perfectly compatible\nwith each other for all pT bin. The v2 obtained for each\nrapidity for pT \u2208 [0 \u2212 5] GeV/c is: \u22120.094 \u00b1 0.104\u00b10.003\n0.005\nat |y| \u2208 [1.2 \u2212 2.2] and \u22120.10 \u00b1 0.10 \u00b1 0.02 at |y| < 0.35.\nIt is unclear whether J/\u03c8 elliptic flow at forward rapidity should differ from mid-rapidity, especially since the\nforward rapidity measurement only reaches |y| = 2.2 and\nthe underlying physics related to collective behavior might\nnot differ much over such a rapidity range. Given this, an\noption is to combine the two rapidity measurements to increase statistical significance of the results. The statistical\ncompatibility for v2 to be positive for pT \u2208 [0 \u2212 5] GeV/c\nis only of the order of 10%. It is dominated by the [1 \u2212\n2] GeV/c bin which is the bin where the J/\u03c8s pT distribution is peaked. The probability of having a positive v2\nin [1 \u2212 2] GeV/c is only 6%. It is more interesting to know\nif v2 is positive and to what extent for pT > 2 GeV/c\nsince coalescence models predict an increase of J/\u03c8 flow\nin this region as seen in Figure 6. The statistical probability for the combined v2 measurements to be positive in\n[2 \u2212 5] GeV/c is 42%, and for it to be above 0.1 is 15%,\nwhich does not allow to distinguish between models. Additional data especially for pT > 3 GeV/c would give more\nstatistical significance.\nSeveral predictions of v2 are shown in Figure 6. Higher\nv2 is predicted when more recombination is at play[17,18,\n19,20], and almost no v2 for direct J/\u03c8s [20,21], even when\nincluding absorption and comover interactions [22]. It is\nto be noted that these predictions are for minimum bias\ncollisions, and computed for mid-rapidity. No predictions\nat forward rapidity are yet available.\nThe J/\u03c8 v2 measured by PHENIX can be but into perspective compared to recent lower energy measurements\nat the SPS. NA60 measured a positive J/\u03c8 v2 of 7 \u00b1 3%\nin In+In non-central collisions [23] with no selection in\npT . At the SPS energy and in In+In collisions, given the\nmuch smaller charm cross section, it is unlikely that a\nsufficient number of cc\u0304 pairs is produced to allow substantial formation of J/\u03c8 by recombination. If confirmed, the\nmeasured positive flow at the SPS is likely caused by other\nphenomena. One might speculate that nuclear absorption\nis responsible, despite earlier expectations that this effect\nshould be negligible. Also at RHIC energies there may be\nadditional contributions affecting v2. In any case, models\nshould provide predictions for different nuclei and energies so that the measurements can distinguish any other\neffects from elliptic flow induced by recombination in a\nQGP. We note that NA50 measured a small J/\u03c8 v2 in\nPb+Pb collisions [24] with a maximum of 3.5 \u00b1 1.5 \u00b1 1.3%\nfor pT = 2 GeV/c. This result is not binned in centrality,\nand since v2 for central collisions should be close to zero,\n\ntheir measurement could correspond to slightly larger values for non-central collisions. Interpretations of these results would also help to shed light on higher energy measurements done at RHIC.\n\n5 Outlook\nPHENIX has measured J/\u03c8 azimuthal anisotropy at forward rapidity for a centrality of 20-60% using all the statistics from the 2007 data taking, and an online-filtered sample. Forward and mid-rapidity results are compatible within\nlarge uncertainties. For each measured pT bin, the value\nis compatible with both zero and maximal flow. The current precision on the measurements does not allow firm\nconclusions.\nThe forward rapidity statistical significance will be improved for final results by using the minimum bias rather\nthan the online-filtered sample, with a gain in statistics by\nabout \u223c10% and by benefiting from the improved handling of the combinatorial background described earlier,\n\u221a\nleading to a reduction of the statistical uncertainty by 2.\nA much larger data sample is expected to be available at\nRHIC in 2010.\n\nReferences\n1.
