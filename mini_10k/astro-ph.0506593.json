Observations were carried out simultaneously with the Proportional Counter Array (PCA) on board the Rossi\nX-ray Timing Explorer satellite (RXTE), the Robotic Optical Transient Search Experiment (ROTSE) and the Nan\u00e7ay decimetric radiotelescope (NRT). Intra-night variability is seen in the VHE band, the source being detected with a high significance on\neach night it was observed. Variability is also found in the X-ray and optical bands on kilosecond timescales, along with fluxdependent spectral changes in the X-rays. A transient X-ray event with a 1500 s timescale is detected, making this the fastest\nX-ray flare seen in this object. No correlation can be established between the X-ray and the \u03b3-ray fluxes, or any of the other\nwavebands, over the small range of observed variability. The average H.E.S.S. spectrum shows a very soft power law shape\nwith a photon index of 3.37 \u00b1 0.07stat \u00b1 0.10sys . The energy outputs in the 2\u201310 keV and in the VHE \u03b3-ray range are found to be\nsimilar, with the X-rays and the optical fluxes at a level comparable to some of the lowest historical measurements, indicating\nthat PKS 2155\u2212304 was in a low or quiescent state during the observations. Both a leptonic and a hadronic model are used\nto derive source parameters from these observations. These parameters are found to be sensitive to the model of Extragalactic\nBackground Light (EBL) that attenuates the VHE signal at this source's redshift (z = 0.117).\n\nAbstract.\n\nKey words. BL Lacertae objects: Individual: PKS 2155\u2212304 - galaxies: active - gamma rays: observations - X-rays:\n\ngalaxies - radiation mechanisms: non thermal\n\n\f1. Introduction\nThe innermost regions of active galactic nuclei, where the\nlargest part of their luminosity is emitted, can be probed\nthrough observations of their flux variability at different wavelengths. The physical processes in their central engines and\njets are usually considered the main candidates for the origin\nof the observed variability. Measurements of correlated variability, spectral variations and time lags across the broad-band\nobservations allow modelling of particle distributions and their\nradiation processes, as well as probing the acceleration mechanisms that are involved.\nPKS 2155\u2212304 is probably the most prominent and beststudied blazar-type Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the\nSouthern Hemisphere. The emission of PKS 2155\u2212304, its\npossible variability patterns, as well as correlations across all\nwavebands, have been studied exhaustively over the past 20\nyears (see e.g. Urry et al. 1997). Its first detection at VHE \u03b3rays by the Durham Mk VI telescopes (Chadwick et al. 1999)\nclassified it as a TeV blazar, like the northern hemisphere\nBL Lac objects Mkn 421, Mkn 501, H 1426+428, or\n1ES 1959+650. Its redshift of z = 0.117 makes it the second most distant confirmed TeV blazar after H 1426+428 (z =\n0.129). PKS 2155\u2212304 was the brightest BL Lac object in the\nEUVE all-sky survey (Marshall, Fruscione & Carone 1995).\nThis source was confirmed as a high energy \u03b3-ray emitter by\nH.E.S.S. (Aharonian et al. 2004, AH04 hereafter) at the 45\u03c3\nsignificance level, when strong detections were reported for\neach of the dark periods of observations.\nHere we report on simultaneous H.E.S.S. VHE \u03b3-ray,\nRXTE/PCA X-ray, ROTSE optical, and NRT decimetric\nobservations of PKS 2155\u2212304 during the dark periods\nof October and November 2003. No simultaneous multiwavelength campaign had before included an Atmospheric\nCherenkov Telescope (ACT) that could sample the evolution of\nthe high energy component of the spectral energy distribution\n(SED) of this object. We also include EGRET archival data,\nand other archival radio through X-ray data obtained from the\nNASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED). Details of the observations and data reduction/analysis are given in \u00a72. Light\ncurves and spectra are described in \u00a73. The attenuation of the\nH.E.S.S. spectrum by the EBL and an interpretation of the data\nusing a leptonic and a hadronic model are discussed in \u00a74.\n\n2. Observations and data analysis\n\n2.1. H.E.S.S.\n2.1.1. H.E.S.S. detector\nIn its first phase, the H.E.S.S. array consists of four atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes operating in stereoscopic mode.\nHowever, the data shown here were taken during the construction of the system, initially with two telescopes, with one more\nas of mid-September, 2003. The fourth and final telescope was\nSend\noffprint\nrequests\nto:\nBerrie\nGiebels\ne-mail:\nberrie@poly.in2p3.fr\n\u22c6\nUMR 7164 (CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Paris VII, CEA, Observatoire de\nParis)\n\nadded to the array in December 2003, subsequent to the data\npresented here. Each telescope has a tessellated 13 m-diameter\n(107 m2 surface area) mirror which focuses the Cherenkov light\nfrom the showers of secondary particles created by the interaction of \u03b3-rays in the atmosphere onto a camera in the focal\nplane. This camera consists of 960 photomultipliers, each with\na pixel size of 0.16\u25e6, giving a field of view of 5\u25e6 . For the data\nsets presented here the \u03b3-ray trigger threshold is \u2248 100 GeV\nand the spectral threshold is 160 GeV with an energy resolution \u2243 15%. The experiment is located in the Khomas highlands in Namibia, (23\u25e6 S, 15\u25e6 E, 1800 m a.s.l.). A detailed description of the layout and the components of the telescope optical systems, including the segmented mirror with its support\nstructure, the mirror facets for each telescope and the Winston\ncone light concentrators in front of the PMT camera can be\nfound in Bernl\u00f6hr et al. (2003), and a description of the mirror alignment is given in Cornils et al. (2003). For details on\nthe camera calibration see Aharonian et al. (2004). The trigger\nsystem is described in Funk, Hermann, Hinton et al. (2004).\nEarly reports of H.E.S.S. have been given elsewhere (see e.g.\nHofmann 2002).\n\n2.1.2. Observations\nIn the beginning of the observation period of October 2003,\na single 5 \u03c3 detection by H.E.S.S. achieved in 1h, triggered\nan approved RXTE ToO (Target of Opportunity) on this target.\nThe results presented here are based on observations carried\nout in 2003 between October 19 and November 26.\nThe data were taken in the Wobble mode where the source\ndirection is positioned \u00b10.5\u25e6 in declination relative to the centre of the field of view of the camera during observations. This\nallows for both on-source observations and simultaneous estimation of the background induced by charged cosmic rays. The\ndata reported here are selected and analyzed with the \"standard\nanalysis\" described in \u00a74 of AH04. The background is estimated here by using all events passing cuts in a ring around\nthe source, as described in section 4.3 in AH04. The runs passing the quality selection criteria total 32.4 hours of livetime on\nthe source. The total two-dimensional significance sky map is\nshown in Figure 1, along with a graph showing the \u03b82 distribution (where \u03b82 is the square of the angular difference between\nthe reconstructed shower position and the source position) of\nthe 1764 excess events observed. This yields a detection at the\n34.3\u03c3 level,\n\u221a at the average rate of 0.91\u03b3/ min and a significance\nof 6.0\u03c3/ h.\nThe methods used here for reconstructing the energy of\neach event and for determining a spectrum are described in \u00a76\nof AH04. The measured time-average spectrum is fitted by a\npower law of the form dN/dE = I0 (E/1 TeV)\u2212\u0393 with I0 the flux\nnormalization at 1 TeV and \u0393 the photon index. The photon index obtained from the time-averaged spectrum is then used as a\nfixed parameter to estimate the integral flux above 300 GeV for\neach run. This integrated flux takes into account the effective\narea and threshold variations due to the source moving through\nthe sky, giving more reliable variability information than counting rates in units of \u03b3-rays/minute.

RXTE\nThe PCA (Jahoda et al. 1996) units of RXTE observed\nPKS 2155\u2212304 between October 22 and November 23 of 2003\nwith exposures of typically 10 ks in October and \u2243 1 ks in\nNovember. The STANDARD2 data were extracted using the\nftools in the HEASOFT 5.3.1 analysis software package pro-\n\n3\n\nvided by NASA/GSFC and filtered using the RXTE Guest\nObserver Facility (GOF) recommended criteria. The changing\nProportional Counter Units (PCU0/2/3) configuration throughout the observations was taken into account in the data reduction, and only the signals from the top layer (X1L and X1R)\nwere used. When reducing the PCUs individually to establish the time-averaged spectrum, the average spectral fit parameters are similar within error bars but with a systematically higher \u03c72 for spectral fits performed on PCU0 data alone.\nOn shorter timescales this effect becomes negligible and PCU0\ncontributes to the statistical significance of the flux measurement. Therefore all PCUs were kept for the overall light curve\nwhich is binned in 400 s bins, but only PCU2 and PCU3 are\nused for the analysis of data segments that are simultaneous\nwith H.E.S.S. runs and for the time-averaged spectrum.\nThe average spectrum used in the SED is derived by\ncombining PCU2 and PCU3 spectra using the addspec tool\nweighted by the counts information delivered by fstatistic\nand then the corresponding response matrices were combined\nwith addrmf. The faint-background model was used and only\nthe 3\u201340 PHA channel range was kept in XSPEC v. 11.3.1,\nor approximately 2\u201320 keV.\nTo build a light curve in units of integrated flux in the\n2\u201310 keV band, spectral data were derived from 400 s bins\nto probe short timescales with adequate statistical accuracy.\nThese segments are then fitted by a power law in XSPEC\nwith PCU configuration-dependent response matrices generated by the ftool pcarsp v. 10.1 and a fixed column density of NH = 1.7 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 obtained from PIMMS1 . This\nyields the flux and the error (corresponding to the 1\u03c3 confidence level) on the flux reported in the light curves in Figure 2,\nin units of 10\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 in the 2\u201310 keV band. The fits did\nnot improve by using a broken power-law for the 400 s binned\nobservations.\n\n2.3. ROTSE\nThe ROTSE-III array is a worldwide network of four 0.45 m\nrobotic, automated telescopes built for fast (\u2248 6 s) response to\nGRB triggers from satellites such as HETE-2 (High Energy\nTransient Explorer 2) and Swift. The ROTSE-III telescopes\nhave a wide (1.85\u25e6 \u00d71.85\u25e6) field of view imaged onto a Marconi\n2048 \u00d7 2048 pixel back-illuminated thinned CCD and are operated without filters. The ROTSE-III systems are described\nin detail in Akerlof et al. (2003). At the time of the observations of PKS 2155\u2212304 in October and November 2003, two\nROTSE-III telescopes were operational in the Southern hemisphere: ROTSE-IIIa located at the Siding Spring Observatory,\nAustralia and ROTSE-IIIc at the H.E.S.S. site. The ROTSEIIIc telescope is located in the centre of the H.E.S.S. telescope\narray. A 30% share of the total observation time is available\nto the H.E.S.S. collaboration, which has been used to perform\nan automated monitoring programme of blazars, including objects that are being observed with the H.E.S.S. telescopes.\nBoth telescopes participated in the observation campaign on\nPKS 2155\u2212304 in October and November 2003.\n1\n\nSee http://legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov/Tools/w3pimms.html\n\n\f4\n\nF. Aharonian et al.: Multi-wavelength observations of PKS 2155-304 with H.E.S.S.\n\nThe telescopes observed PKS 2155\u2212304 typically 10 times\nper night taking sequences of 2 frames with 60 s exposures with\na slight dithering of the pointing to reduce the impact of individual noisy pixels. The typical limiting magnitude, depending\non the sky conditions, is 18.5mag. Overall, 323 bias-subtracted\nand flat-fielded frames have passed visual inspection and are\nused to produce a light curve. A total of 6 frames were rejected\ndue to the presence of stray light from Jupiter.\nUsing an overlay of 50 isolated comparison stars with\nsimilar brightness (12mag \u2212 14mag ) and co-located with\nPKS 2155\u2212304 (< 15 arcmin), a two-dimensional Gaussian is\nfit to the intensity distribution characterising the point-spread\nfunction by \u03c3psf .\nTo estimate the local sky-background for the reference stars\nand the target object, an annulus with inner radius 2 \u00d7 \u03c3psf and\nan outer radius 6\u00d7\u03c3psf is chosen. Based upon a reference frame\nwhich is derived from co-adding 30 individual frames, a mask\nis calculated for each object excluding regions where faint objects coincide with the annulus; pixels exceeding 3 standard\ndeviations of the local sky background are excluded. Using the\nlocal sky background, the intensity and error of each object is\ncalculated. Using the 50 reference stars, a relative intensity and\nstatistical error with respect to a reference frame is calculated.\nThe absolute flux values are obtained by calculating a relative R magnitude by comparing the instrumental magnitude\nwith the USNO catalogue as described in Akerlof et al. (2000).\nThe procedure has been checked by comparing the average R\nmagnitude of a sample of 70 BL Lac type objects determined\nwith ROTSE observations carried out over one year of operation with the V magnitude listed in the 10th Veron Cetty &\nVeron catalogue of BL Lac type objects. The average V \u2212 R of\n0.5 that is found is consistent with the average value for V \u2212 R\nobtained from cross-checking the colours with the 2MASS catalogued value for the BL Lac type objects.\nFinally, the host galaxy has been resolved in optical\n(Falomo 1996) and NIR (Kotilainen, Falomo, & Scarpa 1998,\nKFS98 hereafter) and found to be a typical giant elliptical with\nM(R) = \u221224.4 which translates into an apparent m(R) = 15.1\n(here the distance moduli given by KFS98 have been used to\ncalculate the apparent magnitude based upon the absolute magnitude quoted). The ROTSE measurements have as maximum\nand minimum m(R, min) = 13.3 and m(R, max) = 13.7 which\ncorresponds to 10 mJy for the maximum observed flux and\n6.7 mJy for the minimum flux taking the contribution of the\nhost galaxy into account. These values are considerably lower\nthan the retrieved archival data indicating that PKS 2155\u2212304\nwas in a low state at the moment of the observations.\n\n2.4. NRT\nThe Nan\u00e7ay radiotelescope is a single-dish antenna with a collecting area of 200 \u00d7 34.56 m2 equivalent to that of a 94 mdiameter parabolic dish (van Driel et al. 1996). The half-power\nbeam width at 11 cm is 1.9 arcmin (EW) \u00d711.5 arcmin (NS) (at\nzero declination), and the system temperature is about 45 K in\nboth horizontal and vertical polarizations. The point source efficiency is 0.8 K Jy\u22121 , and the chosen filter bandwidth was 12.5\n\nMHz for each polarization, split into two sub-bands of 6.25\nMHz each. Between 4 and 14 individual 1-minute drift scans\nwere performed for each observation, and the flux was calibrated using a calibrated noise diode emission for each drift\nscan. Data processing has been done with the Nan\u00e7ay local\nsoftware NAPS and SIR.\nA monitoring programme with this telescope on extragalactic sources visible by both the NRT and H.E.S.S. is in place\nsince 2001. For the campaign described here it consisted of a\nmeasurement at 11 cm every two or three days. The average\nflux for the 8 measurements in October and November 2003\nwas 0.30 \u00b1 0.01 Jy with possible marginal variability.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Light curves\nThe October and November 2003 light curves of all the\nH.E.S.S., RXTE and ROTSE observations are shown in\nFigure 2. The H.E.S.S. light curve is binned in run-length\ntimes averaging 28 minutes each. The flux is in units of\n10\u221211 photons cm\u22122s\u22121 above 300 GeV, derived using the average photon index 3.37 obtained in section 3.3. Spectra could\nnot be derived on a run-by-run basis due to the weak signal.\nAs for the observations reported in AH04, the overall light\ncurve is inconsistent with a constant flux. A \u03c72 fit of the data\nto a constant yields a 3.4 \u00d7 10\u221210 \u03c72 probablility. The intranight VHE flux on MJD52936 (Fig. 3) exhibits an increase of\na factor of 1.9 \u00b1 0.6 in 0.11 d. On MJD52932 the peak-to-peak\nflux shows an increase of a factor of 2.5 \u00b1 0.9 within 0.09 d.\nThese timescales are longer than the 30 minute doubling time\nreported in AH04. For these two extreme cases of VHE variability observed during this campaign only the second had a\nlimited RXTE coverage.\nThe 2\u201310 keV X-ray flux in this campaign ranges from\nF2\u221210 keV = 2.0 \u00d7 10\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 to 4.4 \u00d7 10\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 .\nThe maximum is lower than the 20 November 1997 measurement of 2.3 \u00d7 10\u221210 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 (Vestrand & Sreekumar 1999)\nindicating that the X-ray state seen here is not exceptionally\nhigh. The minimum seen here is consistent with historically\nlow fluxes (Zhang, Treves et al. 2002). The intra-night variability is also obvious here, but no flare was completely resolved.\nA 60% flux variability in tvar \u2248 1.5 ks on MJD52936 is\nthe best marked transient episode in the observations reported\nhere (bottom panel b) in Figure 3 for which the H.E.S.S. observations were made at the end of the transit inducing a large\nassociated error on the flux estimation due to the high zenith\nangle of the source. This timescale is comparable to those reported by Gaidos et al. (1996) where doubling times as short as\n15 min from Mkn 421 were observed in the VHE band.\nThis flare is the fastest rise seen in this object to\ndate since BeppoSAX saw a 5 \u00d7 104 s rise timescale\n(Zhang, Treves et al. 2002) and Kataoka et al. (2000) observed\na doubling timescale of 3 \u00d7 104 s with the ASCA satellite. So far the fastest rise in this type of object was\nobserved in Mkn 501 with a 60% increase in less than\n200 s (Catanese & Sambruna 2000) though Xue & Cui (2004)\nclaims that this flare is likely to be an artifact.\n\n\fF>300 GeV [ 10-11 cm-2 s-1 ]\n\nF.

Aharonian et al.: Multi-wavelength observations of PKS 2155-304 with H.E.S.S.\n\nThe optical emission of PKS 2155\u2212304 is dominated by\nthe nucleus which outshines the host galaxy by a factor of \u2248 4\ngiven in KFS98. The observed variability amplitude is therefore not biased by the constant emission of the host galaxy and\nmainly due to the activity of the nucleus. The peak-to-peak amplitude of variability is moderate compared to the variability\namplitude at shorter wavelengths and typically 0.1mag peak-topeak. The object has been monitored over longer time-scales\nwith the ROTSE-IIIc telescopes showing variations with amplitudes close to 1mag .\n\nF >300 GeV[ 10 -11 cm-2 s-1 ]\n\n6\n\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\na)\n\n-1\n\n4\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5 3 3.5-11 4\n4.5\n5\n-2 -1\nF2-10 keV [ 10 erg cm s ]\n\n4.5\n\nMJD52936/52937 October 24/25 2003\n\nF>300 GeV [ 10 -11 cm-2 s-1 ]\n\n-11\n\n-2 -1\n\nF >300 GeV [ 10 cm s ]\n\n0\n\n4\n\n3.5\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2.5\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1.5\n1\n\n1\n\n0.5\nb)\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.65\n\n0.7\n\n0.75\n\n0.8\n\n5\n3\n\n4\n3\n\n2\n\n-11\n\n-1\n\n4\n\n2\n\nF2-10 keV [ 10 -11 erg cm -2 s-1 ]\n\n-2\n\n6\n\nF2-10 keV [10 erg s cm ]\n\nRate (Counts/s/PCU)\n\na)\n\n0.85\n0.9\nRelative Mag (a.u.)\n\n4.5\n4\n\n3.5\n3\n\n2.5\n2\n\n1.5\n\nc)\n\n1\n0.74\nb)\n\n1\n936.75 936.8 936.85 936.9 936.95\n\n1\n\n937 937.05\nMJD-52000\n\nFig. 3.

Spectra\nThe October and November 2003 H.E.S.S. data were all combined for the spectrum shown in Figure 5. The best-fitting\npower law (\u03c72 = 7 for 8 degrees of freedom) is given by:\n\n\u0012 E \u0013\u22123.37\u00b10.07\u00b10.10\ndN\n= (2.73 \u00b1 0.17) \u00d7 10\u221212\ndE\nTeV\ncm\u22122 s\u22121 TeV\u22121\n\n(1)\n\nwhich is comparable to \u0393 = 3.32 \u00b10.06 and I0 = (1.96 \u00b10.12) \u00d7\n10\u221212 cm\u22122 s\u22121 TeV\u22121 previously reported in AH04.\nThe result of the broken power law fit for the combined\nRXTE PCU2 and PCU3 spectrum is shown in Figure 6. It\nyields an unabsorbed flux in the 2\u201310 keV band of F2\u221210 keV =\n(2.66 \u00b1 0.04) \u00d7 10\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 (\u03c72 = 41, 31 degrees of freedom), a lower index of \u0393L = 2.81 \u00b1 0.05, a break energy of\nEb = 4.9 \u00b1 0.8 keV and a higher index of \u0393H = 2.95 \u00b1 0.04.\nA single power law fit to the same data yields F2\u221210 keV =\n(2.69 \u00b1 0.03) \u00d7 10\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 (\u03c72 = 51, 34 degrees of\n\nfreedom) and an index of \u0393 = 2.88 \u00b1 0.13, a poorer fit than\nthe broken power law, but the index still provides information\nthat can be used for comparison with historical measurements.\nIndeed, the derived index is close to those measured by the\nBeppoSAX satellite (Giommi, Fiore, Guainazzi et al. 1998),\nGINGA (Sembay et al. 1993) and well within the range\nobserved by EXOSAT (Treves et al. 1989). The statistics\nabove 10 keV in our RXTE observations are too poor to\ncheck the existence of a possible hard tail above 20 keV\n(Giommi, Fiore, Guainazzi et al. 1998) which might be the signature of the onset of a high-energy component.\nIn order to look for flux dependent spectral variability, the\nRXTE data subset used in Figure 3 is divided into two energy bands, the PHA channels 0\u20139 (soft band) and 10\u201327 (hard\nband), corresponding to approximately 1\u20134 keV and 4\u201311 keV,\nrespectively. A hardness ratio (HR), shown in Figure 7, is the\nratio of the counting rate in the hard band over the soft band.\nThere is a clear correlation of the HR with the rate, peaking\nwhen the rate is highest. The correlation factor between the\nrate and the HR is r = 0.76 \u00b1 0.12. Even though the variability timescale here is much smaller, this behavior is compatible\nwith the hardening reported in Chiappetti et al. (1999).\n\n3.4. EBL corrected spectrum\nFor objects at non-negligible redshifts, the large, energydependent opacities can cause the emitted spectrum to\nbe greatly modified both in shape and intensity (see\n\n\f8\n\nF.

X-ray spectrum derived from the summed October and November 2003 data, using PCU2 and PCU3, fitted by a broken\npower law. The top panel shows the data and folded model, the bottom panel shows the residuals between the data and the model.\n\nHR\n\nThe three models used here are (in order from higher\nto lower fluxes): the phenomenological shape used in\n1.8\nAharonian et al. (2003), which is based on the original\nPrimack et al. (2001) calculation but smoothed and scaled up\n1.6\nto match the data points below 1 \u03bcm and at 2\u20133.5 \u03bcm (here1.4\nafter Phigh); the original Primack et al. (2001) calculation\nfor a Salpeter initial mass function (hereafter Primack01);\n1.2\nand the new 2004 calculation (Primack et al. 2004, hereafter\n1\nPrimack04), which takes advantage of the recent improvements\nin the knowledge of the cosmological parameters and of the lo0.8\ncal luminosity function of galaxies.\n0.6\nThe opacities are calculated from the EBL SED shapes taking into account only the cosmology (H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc,\n0.4\n\u03a9Mat = 0.3 and \u03a9\u039b = 0.7). To treat all three shapes simi0.2\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 larly, no evolution has been introduced at this point. This corRate (Counts/s/PCU) responds to a \"maximum absorption\" hypothesis (i.e., for increasing z, constant instead of decreasing EBL comoving enFig. 7.

(2001), the difference is still small (variation in the photon index \u2206\u0393 < 0.1\ne.g. Stecker et al. 1992, Biller 1995, Coppi & Aharonian 1999, in the range 0.3\u20131 TeV), and negligible compared to the differVassiliev 2000).

This effect is directly related to the different flux\nergy range which mostly affects the H.E.S.S. spectrum: with levels of the stellar peak component, which imprint a differdata up to 3\u20133.5 TeV, the peak of the \u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3 cross section is ent amount of softening onto the original spectrum.

All spectra from \"Primack-type\" models are compatible with a power-law shape, with different slopes: hard (Phigh)\nand soft (Primack01, Primack04), locating the intrinsic SED peak for the high component above 1\u20132 TeV or below 200 GeV,\nrespectively.\nthe blazar's high energy peak, with the dividing line represented by the EBL flux which gives \u0393 = 2.0 (1.3 times the\nPrimack01 model). Models with stellar peak fluxes above this\n(such as Phigh, and generally all those in agreement with the\ndirect estimates of the fluxes between 2 and 3.5 \u03bcm) imply a\nhard intrinsic spectrum (\u0393 < 2), and thus an IC peak above 1\u2013\n2 TeV. EBL models with lower fluxes (such as the Primack01\nand Primack04) imply instead a soft spectrum (\u0393 > 2), locating\nthe IC peak below the observed energy range (< 200 GeV). In\nthe following, we will discuss both scenarios for the SED modelling, using the Phigh and Primack2004 curves as the two ends\nof the possible range of values for the \"Primack-type\" shape\n(i.e., between the claimed EBL direct measurements at few microns and the lower limits from galaxy counts).\n\n4. SED Modelling\nThe broadband spectral morphology of PKS 2155\u2212304 is typical of the BL Lac type, with a double-humped structure in \u03bdF\u03bd\nrepresentation, exhibiting a low-energy and a high-energy component. Its broadband emission is usually attributed to emission from a beamed relativistic jet, oriented in a direction\nclose to the line of sight (Begelman, Blandford & Rees 1984,\nBlandford & K\u00f6nigl 1979). The spectral energy distribution in\nunits of power per logarithmic bandwidth E 2 dN/dE versus en-\n\nergy E is shown in Figure 10. The EGRET measurements,\nbetween the H.E.S.S. and RXTE points, are from the third\nEGRET catalog (Hartman 1999) and from a very high \u03b3-ray\nstate described in Vestrand, Stacy & Sreekumar (1995). There\nis a difference in spectral states, since in the former case the\npower law photon index is 1.71 \u00b1 0.24 whereas it is 2.34 \u00b1 0.26\nin the latter which most likely consists of a mix of low and\nhigh activity state observations. The historical EGRET spectra\nare therefore unlikely to represent the state of PKS 2155\u2212304\nduring the campaign presented here and are not used to put\nstringent constraints on the modelling. Considering the archival\ndata and the steep X-ray spectrum in Figure 10, the peak\nof the low-energy component occurs in the 2\u20132000 eV range.\nThe archival BeppoSAX data from a high state analyzed by\nChiappetti et al. (1999), and represented here above our RXTE\ndata, show a peak at \u2248 0.1 keV. The absorbed VHE peak location is clearly below 300 GeV, with its exact location depending on the spectrum in the EGRET range.\nWhereas the current models seem to agree that the\nlow-energy component is dominated by synchrotron radiation coming from nonthermal electrons emitted in\ncollimated jets, the high-energy emission is assumed\nto be either inverse Compton scattering off the synchrotron photons (Synchrotron Self-Compton, SSC, see\n\n\f10\n\nF. Aharonian et al.: Multi-wavelength observations of PKS 2155-304 with H.E.S.S.\n\nlaw falls below the H.E.S.S. data and therefore requires two\ninflexion points in the SED. Simultaneous observations in the\nMeV-GeV range with the upcoming satellite GLAST will be\ncrucial to constrain the high-energy component shape.\n\n4.1. Doppler boosting and synchrotron/Compton\nderived parameters\n\nFig. 8. Spectral energy distribution of the Extragalactic\nBackground Light (EBL). It is thought to be characterized\nby two distinct bumps, around 1\u20132 and 100\u2013200 \u03bcm, produced by the red-shifted stellar light and re-radiated thermal dust emission, respectively. The compilation of measurements have been taken from Hauser & Dwek (2001) and\nAharonian et al. (2003). Lower limits are from HST and\nISO source counts (Madau & Pozzetti 2000, Elbaz et al. 2002,\nGardner et al. 2000). Above 400 \u03bcm, the contribution of the\nCMB starts to dominate. The three continuous lines represent\nthe \"Primack-type\" EBL shapes: from higher to lower fluxes\n(at 1 \u03bcm), Phigh, Primack01 and Primack04 models (see text).\nThe steep line starting at 300 \u03bcm is the onset of the CMBR.\ne.g. Maraschi et al. 1999, Bicknell & Wagner 2002) or by\nexternal photons (see e.g. Sikora et al. 1994). This kind of\nleptonic model will be discussed in section 4.2. A hadronic\norigin of the VHE emission using the Synchrotron-Proton\nBlazar (SPB) model with a dominating proton synchrotron\ncomponent at high energies in a proton-electron plasma is\nalso able to produce a double humped SED and is discussed\nin section 4.3. The lack of correlation between the RXTE and\nH.E.S.S. fluxes (and possibly also between the optical and\nthe VHE emission) within the small variability range may\nindicate a different spatial origin, or a different underlying\nparticle distribution. In the proton synchrotron model a lack\nof correlated variability between \u03b3-ray emission and the low\nenergy electron synchrotron component could arise if the\nelectrons and protons are not co-accelerated.\nThe high-energy component above \u2248 100 GeV is attenuated by interactions with the EBL and is a lower limit for the\nintrinsic spectrum. The energy budget in X-rays and VHE \u03b3rays is comparable, though the maximum output at the peak\nenergy in the high-energy component is likely to be lower than\nthat in the lower-energy component. Interpolating between the\nhigh-state EGRET archival data and VHE data would lead to a\nmaximum located above 10 GeV, which is surprising since the\nobservations reported here indicate a low state. Extrapolating\nthe EGRET catalogue spectrum to VHE energies with a power\n\nThe electromagnetic emission in blazars is very likely to\nbe Doppler-boosted (or beamed) toward the observer. In\nthe radio regime, the evidence for Doppler boosting in\nPKS 2155\u2212304 comes from superluminal expansions observed\nwith VLBI (Piner & Edwards 2004). Relativistic beaming is\nalso required in order to avoid absorption of GeV photons by\nX-ray photons via the e+ /e\u2212 pair-production process (see e.g.\nMaraschi, Ghisellini & Celotti 1992). It is thus possible to use\nthe \u03b3-ray variability to establish a limit for the Doppler factor \u03b4,\nwith \u03b4 defined in the standard way as [\u0393(1 \u2212 \u03b2 cos \u03b8)]\u22121 , where\n\u0393 is the bulk Lorentz factor of the plasma in the jet, \u03b2 = v/c,\nand \u03b8 is the angle to the line of sight.\nFollowing Dondi & Ghisellini (1995), the size of the \u03b3-ray\nemission zone R is derived from the time-scale of variability\ntvar (supposing the timescale of intrinsic variability is negligible\ncompared to the light crossing time) by R \u2264 ctvar \u03b4/(1 + z). In\nthis case (assuming a time scale tvar \u2248 2 ks from section 3) the\nsize of the emission region is\nR\u03b4\u22121 \u2264 5 \u00d7 1013 cm.\n\n(2)\n\nSince for \u03b3-rays in the 300 GeV\u20133 TeV range the opacity\n\u03c4\u03b3\u03b3 cannot significantly exceed 1, independently of the emission mechanisms, another constraint on the minimum value\nof the Doppler factor can be derived by estimating how much\nDoppler boosting is necessary for photons with observed energy E\u03b3 to escape from a source with radius R and a flux density F(Et ), where Et = (me c2 )2 \u03b42 /E\u03b3 (1 + z)2 . At this point\none can follow Mattox et al. (1993) and especially Eq. 3.7 in\nDondi & Ghisellini (1995), writing that the opacity is\n\u03c4\u03b3\u03b3 \u2248\n\n1\n\u03c3T 1 dL2\nF(Et ).\n5 hc R \u03b43 (1 + z)\n\n(3)\n\nImposing that \u03c4\u03b3\u03b3 < 1 for photons with observed energy E\u03b3 =\n1 TeV yields a lower limit on \u03b4 for given R that can be derived\nnumerically from the observed SED. For PKS 2155\u2212304 this\nyields\nR\u22121 \u03b4\u22126.4 \u2264 5.6 \u00d7 10\u221224 cm\u22121 .\n(4)\nThe minimum allowable boost \u03b4 comes from combining Eq. 2\nand Eq. 4 and yields\n\u03b4 \u2265 19\n(5)\nwhich is higher than the limit obtained in a similar way in\nTavecchio et al. (1998), but at the lower end of the range usually obtained from SSC modelling as in Kataoka et al. (2000).\nIt is useful to stress that this constraint is valid under the usual\nassumption that the region emitting the SED optical flux (i.e.,\nthe target photons) is cospatial with (or at least embeds) the\nhigh energy emitting region. The models used later in this paper are therefore essentially single zone models.\n\n\fF.

The\nparameters are described in Katarzy\u0144ski et al.

This\nis often measured in BL Lac objects; a hardening of the spectrum when flares occur, and a blueward shift of the peak of\nthe synchrotron emission \u03bdsync (and presumably higher energy\ninverse-Compton emission) by factors that can be as large as\n100 were measured in the cases of Mkn 501 (Pian et al. 1998),\n1ES 1426+428 and PKS 0548\u2212322 (Costamante et al. 2001).\nIn the case of PKS 2005\u2212489 (Perlman et al. 1999), a more\nmoderate shift of a factor of 3 or less of the synchrotron emission was found. The archival data suggest that \u03bdsync lies in the\nUV band for PKS 2155\u2212304, but no data were taken simultaneously in this campaign at that wavelength.\nThe lack of indication for correlated X-ray/VHE variability\ndoes not imply that PKS 2155\u2212304 behaves differently from\nVHE sources such as Mkn 421, for which VHE/X-ray correlation has been established on a much higher variability basis\n(see e.g. Cui et al. 2004) with dynamical ranges of 30 in both\nenergy bands. Limiting those observations to the same dynamical range as observed here would not allow any claim for correlation. Future observations of PKS 2155\u2212304 with a higher\nvariability amplitude would bring more insight into this.\n\n4.2. Leptonic interpretation\nInterpretation with a single zone SSC model of the SED\nof PKS 2155\u2212304 has already been proposed in the literature using two different assumptions. In Kataoka et al. (2000)\nthe low energy tail of the SSC model is used to account\nfor the low-energy component up to the optical in the SED.\n\nThat component is decomposed into two sub-components by\nChiappetti et al. (1999) where the radio to optical emission\nhas another origin than the X-rays, which are assumed to\ncome from the jet. These two different interpretations are\nused here in the context of the leptonic model described in\nKatarzy\u0144ski et al. (2001) which has already been applied to\nMkn 501 and Mkn 421 (Katarzy\u0144ski et al. 2003). To constrain\nthis model, only the simultaneous data are used, since the\narchival data reported in the SED of Figure 10 are likely to\nnot represent the state of this source (note for example the difference in optical flux and the ROTSE measurement).\nWhen using the Primack04 absorption, the model used here\ncan reproduce the X-ray through VHE part of the SED, but the\nH.E.S.S. spectrum constrains it such that the radio measurement can not be included in the synchrotron bump predicted by\nthe single-zone model. As for Mkn 421 and Mkn 501, adding\na more extended component than the VHE emitting zone can\nprovide an explanation for this. The origin is probably the\ncompact VLBI core which has a radio core to lobe ratio of\n\u2248 1 (Laurent-Muehleisen et al. 1993, Piner & Edwards 2004)\nand a typical size of 1018 cm, more than two orders of magnitude larger than the VHE emitting zone. This VLBI feature dominates the spectrum at low energy and is included\nin the SED modelling here. An uncertainty remains which\nis the high frequency cutoff of this VLBI component. The\nhost galaxy contribution to the optical flux is estimated to be\n\u2248 10\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , deduced from the magnitudes given by\nKFS98 and assuming a low-redshift solar metallicity elliptical\ngalaxy of age equal to 13 Gyr (R \u2212 H = 2.4), corresponding\nto a mass of 5 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 (Fioc & Rocca-Volmerange 1997). So\neven at the measured low activity state of PKS 2155\u2212304 the\nhost galaxy is not contributing much in the optical range.\nThe ROTSE measurement can be ascribed here to either the\nhigh-energy tail of the VLBI component or to the synchrotron\n\n\fF.

Spectral energy distribution of PKS2155\u2212304. Only simultaneous measurements are labeled. Non contemporaneous data\nare in grey symbols. The H.E.S.S. spectrum is derived from October and November 2003 data (filled circles) as is the RXTE\nspectrum. The NRT radio point (filled square) is the average value for the observations carried out during this period. The two\ntriangles are the highest and lowest ROTSE measurements for the Oct-Nov observations. Archival SAX data represent the high\nstate observed in 1997 from Chiappetti et al. (1999). Archival EGRET data are from the third EGRET catalogue (shaded bowtie),\nHartman 1999) and from a very high \u03b3-ray state described in Vestrand, Stacy & Sreekumar (1995) (open bowtie). 1995 U B V\nR I data are from Paltani et al. (1997) where the mean flux and flux deviation is used here. IUE data from Urry et al. (1993) at\n2800 \u00c5 and 1400 \u00c5 are included here with an error bar corresponding to the spread of the measured fluxes. Other data are NED\narchival data. The solid line is the hadronic model described in section 4.3. The dotted and dashed lines are the same leptonic\nmodel with different assumptions described in section 4.2: the dotted line assumes a common origin for the optical and X-ray\nsynchrotron emission, while the dashed line is the case where the optical emission emanates from the VLBI core; for both cases\nthe lowest frequency hump is the predicted VLBI core emission. All the VHE emission in the models are absorbed according to\nthe Primack04 model discussed in section 3.4.\npart of the SSC model. Assuming a common origin for the Xrays and the optical emission, and using a variability time scale\nof 0.1 d to constrain the emitting zone, the model tends to predict a high IC flux, as shown in Figure 10. However, the lack\nof correlation between the X-rays and the optical emission in\nour measurements - also suggested by Dominici et al. (2004)\nbased on less sensitive RXTE/ASM measurements - indicates\nthat the optical emission could originate from the VLBI component, which is modelled by a slight increase in the maximal\nLorentz factor of the emitting electrons. This in turn lessens the\nconstraint on the simultaneous SSC fit of the X-ray and VHE\npart and allows a better fit of the VHE spectrum for smaller\n\nsizes of the emitting zone. Detailed parameters of the two hypotheses are given in Table 1.\nIf the absorption correction is well described by the Phigh\nmodel, the slope of H.E.S.S. data at high energy implies that\nthe peak of the TeV emission bump is located above 4 TeV\n(or 1027 Hz). Such a high frequency peak emission imposes a\nstrong constraint for the single-zone SSC scenario, especially\nsince the peak of the synchrotron bump has to remain below\n1 keV (or 1017.5 Hz) as required by the slope of the RXTE data.\nHigh values of both the jet Doppler factor and the maximal\nLorentz factor of radiating particles are required to reach the\nnecessary energy for the IC bump, that is \u03b3max \u03b4 > 8 \u00d7 106 .\nOn the other hand, to keep the synchrotron peak below 1 keV\n\n\fF. Aharonian et al.: Multi-wavelength observations of PKS 2155-304 with H.E.S.S.\n\nimposes an upper limit to the magnetic field. Within these constrains, the best fit we obtain is shown in Figure 11. We can\nnote that none of the high energy tails are well accounted for.\nThe set of parameters for the best fit is given in Table 1. This fit\nmarginally reproduces the observed X-ray and \u03b3-ray data, but\nis not as satisfactory than that obtained with the Primack04 absorption correction, and in any case it is impossible to take into\naccount the ROTSE optical point. The main changes in parameters between the two fits consist in enhancing the boosting,\nwhich then becomes quite extreme, while reducing the density\nand magnetic field for the Phigh absorption correction.\nThe constraints on \u03b4 derived here from either simple opacity arguments or from the one-zone model parametrisation of\nthe SED are in the range of Doppler factors usually derived\nwith such assumptions or models for other VHE emitters. As\npointed out by Chiaberge et al. (2000) such high values are\nhowever at odds with attempts to unify the BL Lac population with the family of FR I sources (Urry & Padovani 1995),\nthe latter being possibly an unbeamed since off-axis viewed\ncase of the former. The same authors suggest that models where velocity structures in the jet, such as the \"spinesheath\" model (see e.g. Sol, Pelletier & Asseo 1989) or the\ndecelerating flow model (Georganopoulos & Kazanas 2003,\nGeorganopoulos & Kazanas 2004) allow lower bulk Lorentz\nfactors. Another option from Pelletier et al. 2004 is to cope\nwith the pair creation catastrophe implied by smaller Doppler\nfactors in their \"two-flow\" solution. Comparing the SED with\nsuch models, which make the BL Lac - FR-I connection more\nplausible, is an interesting task but beyond the scope of this\npaper.\n\n4.3. Hadronic models\nGenerally, the leptonic models constitute the preferred concept for TeV blazars, essentially because of two attractive features: (i) the capability of the (relatively) well understood shocks to accelerate electrons to TeV energies\n(Sikora & Madejski 2001, Pelletier 2001) and (ii) the effective conversion of the kinetic energy of these relativistic\nelectrons into the X-ray and VHE \u03b3-ray emission components through the synchrotron and inverse Compton radiation channels. The hadronic models are generally lack these\nvirtues. They assume that the observed \u03b3-ray emission is initiated by accelerated protons interacting with ambient matter\n(Bednarek 1993, Dar & Laor 1997, Pohl & Schlickeiser 2000),\nphoton fields (PIC model, Mannheim 2000), magnetic fields\n(Aharonian et al. 2002) or both (M\u00fccke & Protheroe 2000).\nThe models of TeV blazars involving interactions of protons with photon and B-fields require particle acceleration to\nextreme energies exceeding 1019 eV which is possible if the\nacceleration time is close to tacc = rg /c (rg is the gyro-radius).\nThis corresponds (independent of a specific acceleration mechanism) to the maximum (theoretically possible) acceleration\nrates (Aharonian et al. 2002) which can only be achieved by\nthe conventional diffusive shock acceleration in the Bohm diffusion regime.\n\n13\n\nOn the other hand, the condition of high efficiency of radiative cooling of accelerated particles requires extreme parameters characterizing the sub-parsec jets and their environments,\nin particular very high densities of the thermal plasma, radiation and/or B-fields. In particular, the proton-synchrotron models of TeV blazars require highly magnetized (B \u226b 10 G) condensations of \u03b3-ray emitting clouds containing Extremely High\nEnergy (EHE) protons, where the magnetic pressure dominates\nover the pressure of relativistic protons (Aharonian 2000).\nBelow\nwe\nuse\nthe\nhadronic\nSPB\nmodel\n(M\u00fccke & Protheroe 2000, M\u00fccke & Protheroe 2001) to\nmodel the average spectral energy distribution (SED) of\nPKS 2155\u2212304 in October-November 2003. A detailed\ndescription of the model, and its implementation as a (timeindependent) Monte-Carlo/numerical code, has been given in\nM\u00fccke, Protheroe et al. (2003) and Reimer et al. (2004).\nConsidering the rather quiet activity state of\nPKS 2155\u2212304 in Oct-Nov. 2003, we use the 3EG catalog spectrum, since it is the best determined EGRET spectrum\nfrom this source to date, as an upper limit for modelling\npurposes.\nFlux variability provides an upper limit for the size of the\nemission region. To allow for a comparative study between leptonic and hadronic models we fix here the comoving emission\nregion to R \u223c ctvar \u03b4 = 5 \u00d7 1013 \u03b4 cm deduced from the X-ray\nvariability. We assume that the optical through X-ray emission\nand the \u03b3-ray output stem from the same region of size R.\nA reasonable model representation for the simultaneous\ndata assuming a Primack04 model for the VHE absorption is\nfound for the following parameters: magnetic field B = 40 G,\nDoppler factor \u03b4 = 20, injection electron spectral index \u03b1e =\n1.6, assumed to be identical to the injection proton spectral index \u03b1p , maximum proton energy of order \u03b3p,max \u223c 4 \u00d7 109 ,\ne/p-ratio of 0.15 and a near-equipartition proton energy density\nof up = 27 erg cm\u22123. The required total jet power is of the order\nLjet \u223c 1.6 \u00d7 1045 erg s\u22121 . When using the Phigh EBL model, a\nreasonable representation of the data may be achieved by increasing the maximum injected proton energy to \u03b3p,max = 1010\nand simultaneously increasing the e/p-ratio to 0.24, while all\nother parameters remain unchanged. Note that here the maximum proton gyro-radius approaches the size of the emission\nregion. Alternatively, a doubling of the magnetic field to 80 G\ntogether with an increase of \u03b3p,max to 8 \u00d7 109 and a e/p-ratio of\nunity (leading to uB \u2248 50up ) represents the SED-data equally\nwell. In conclusion, none of the \"Primack-type\" EBL models can explicitly be ruled out in the framework of the SPBmodel by the H.E.S.S. data presented here. In all cases, proton\nsynchrotron emission dominates the (sub-)TeV radiative output. Depending on the Doppler factor, part of the proton synchrotron radiation produced may be reprocessed to lower energies. Contributions from the muon and pion cascades are always lower than the proton synchrotron component. The low\nenergy component is dominated by synchrotron radiation from\nthe primary electrons, with a negligible contribution of synchrotron radiation from secondary electrons (produced by the\np- and \u03bc\u00b1 -synchrotron cascade).\nOn the other hand, the synchrotron radiation of secondary\nelectrons resulting from interactions of VHE \u03b3-rays with ex-\n\n\fF.

Conclusions\nThis paper reports multi-wavelength observations of the BL\nLac object PKS 2155\u2212304 in 2003. Although the source appeared variable in the VHE, X-rays and optical bands, the latter\ntwo indicate that PKS 2155\u2212304 was in a state close to historically low measurements, even though it was easily detectable\nby H.E.S.S. in all nights of observations since the beginning\nof the detector operation (see AH04 for the observation history up to August 2003). An extreme case of VHE variability\nshows a peak-to-peak increase of a factor of 2.5 \u00b1 0.9 in 0.09 d.\nVariability on the timescale of a few ks in the 2\u201310 keV band\nand of the order of 0.1 d for energies > 300 GeV were observed\nby RXTE and H.E.S.S. The X-ray data show a correlation of\nthe flux with the spectrum, which becomes harder when the\nsource is brighter. At the level of the simultaneously observed\nmodest variability, no correlation between the VHE \u03b3-rays, the\nX-rays and optical was seen. Observations with greater variability and better coverage are needed before it can be asserted\nthat the VHE/X-ray pattern in PKS 2155\u2212304 is different from\nother known VHE-emitting AGN. Since the source was in a\n\nlow emission state in both the optical and X-rays compared\nto archival measurements, this lack of correlation has yet to\nbe established for a higher emission state. Simultaneous observations in the X-rays/optical band and VHE \u03b3-rays had never\npreviously been performed on this scale. Its continual VHE\ndetection makes PKS 2155\u2212304 unique in the TeV BL Lac\ncategory, and probably indicates that H.E.S.S. has achieved\nthe sensitivity level where it can detect the quiescent state of\nPKS 2155\u2212304 at any time. A time-averaged energy spectrum\nis determined for the 2 observation periods and fits to a power\nlaw (\u0393 = 3.37\u00b10.07) in the VHE \u03b3-rays, and to a broken power\nlaw (\u0393L = 2.81 \u00b1 0.05, Eb = 4.9 \u00b1 0.8 keV, \u0393H = 2.95 \u00b1 0.04)\nin the X-rays.\nA comparison of the intrinsic spectrum with predictions\nfrom existing one-zone leptonic and one-zone hadronic models is attempted to give a plausible estimation of underlying\nphysical parameters. The values of the parameters are in line\nwith those inferred for other VHE-emitting blazars. In these\nmodels the VHE emission is attenuated according to two different EBL levels. This changes mainly the Doppler boosting\nin the leptonic model, but the high level EBL decreases the\nagreement significantly. In the hadronic model, the maximum\ninjected proton energy can be changed to accomodate different\nEBL levels and can therefore not significantly constrain any of\nthe EBL models used here.\nAcknowledgements.
