(See also the reviews [5, 6].) Extension of this\ntheory to the decay problem [7, 8] suggested a fast (exponential) decay of the passive scalar in the case of spatially smooth (that is approximated by linear velocity\nprofiles at relevant scales) and unbounded random flow.\n(We will call this case the \"pure Batchelor\" one.) In parallel, laboratory experiments [9, 10, 11, 12] and numerical simulations [13, 14, 15, 16] were conducted to verify\nthe Batchelor-Kraichnan theory. However, a comparison between theory, experiment and numerical simulations was not conclusive. Different experiments and simulations showed different results, inconsistent with each\nother and with the theory. In this letter we explain a possible source of the discrepancy. Our major point is that\nthe Batchelor-Kraichnan theory does not apply to the\nlate-time stage of the scalar decay measured in the decay laboratory and numerical experiments [9, 10, 12, 13].\nThis is because the long-time decay is dominated by the\nregions of the flow, where the mixing is not as efficient\nas in the pure Batchelor case.\nBefore constructing a quantitative theory, let us draw\na qualitative physical picture. We start from the first example of a multi-scale turbulent flow with the following\nhierarchy of scales assumed: Lv \u226b \u03b7 \u226b rd , where Lv\nis the energy containing scale of the flow, \u03b7 is the Kolmogorov (viscous) scale and rd is the diffusive scale of the\nscalar. It is known that the passive scalar mixing in the\ninertial range of turbulent flow is slower at larger scales,\nsince the turnover time grows with scale. This explains\nthe algebraic-in-time decay of the scalar for the inertial\nrange of scales, Lv \u226b r \u226b \u03b7 [17, 18]. If we now take\ninto account that turbulent velocity is smooth at scales\nsmaller than \u03b7, it becomes important to understand what\n\nhappens with the scalar fluctuations at these small scales.\nWe show in the letter that scalar decay is accompanied\nby both upscale and downscale transport, however, the\nsituation is asymmetric. The decay of scalar fluctuations\nin time is due to inertial interval physics, while the spatial\ncorrelations of the scalar at the smallest scales are mainly\ncontrolled by the viscous part of the flow. (Here, the spatial correlations of the scalar are logarithmic, like in the\nstationary case [4].) An analogous situation is realized\nif the scalar is advected by a chaotic (spatially smooth)\nflow in a box or a pipe. Advection of the scalar slows\ndown in the boundary region, while mixing continues to\nbe efficient in the bulk, i.e. far from the boundaries. The\nresult is that the boundary region supplies the scalar into\nthe bulk. Plumes (blobs) of the scalar, injected from the\nboundary domain into the box center, cascade in a fast\nway down to rd where diffusion smears it out. Therefore,\nthe temporal decay of the scalar is mainly controlled by\nthe rate of scalar injection from the boundary layer. This\ncauses an essential slow down of the decay in comparison with the pure Batchelor case, since in this case there\nare no stagnation (boundary) regions. The decay of the\nscalar is algebraic during the transient stage, when the\nscalar is supplied to the bulk from the boundary region\nwhich is wider than the diffusive boundary layer. The\nboundary region width decreases with time. Whenever\nthe boundary layer width becomes of the order of the\ndiffusive layer width the decrease stops and the algebraic\ntemporal decay turns into an exponential one. The exponential decay rate appears to be parametrically smaller\nthan in the pure Batchelor case.\nIn all the cases discussed, we consider decay of a passive\nscalar, \u03b8, described by the equation\n\u2202t \u03b8 + (v\u2207)\u03b8 = \u03ba\u22072 \u03b8,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere v is the flow velocity and \u03ba is the diffusion coefficient. Our goal is, starting from the equation (1) and\nassuming some statistical properties of the velocity field\nv, to describe statistics of the passive scalar decay. In\n\n\f2\norder to understand the qualitative features of the passive scalar decay, we choose (in the spirit of Kraichnan\n[19]) the simplest possible case of a short-correlated in\ntime velocity, possessing Gaussian statistics. This model\nenables us to obtain analytically a time evolution of the\npassive scalar correlation functions. Two situations are\ndiscussed. The first is of a statistically homogeneous\nflow (infinite volume) with a multi-scale velocity which is\nsmooth at small scales, and possesses a scaling behavior\nat larger scales. The Reynolds number Re = (Lv /\u03b7)4/3\nand the Prandtl number P r = (\u03b7/rd )2 are both assumed\nto be large. The second situation is 2d chaotic flow confined within a disk. We also discuss an extension to the\ncase of a more realistic pipe flow. The flow is assumed\nto be smooth and obeying the standard viscous behavior in the neighborhood of the boundary: the longitudinal and transverse components of the velocities tend\nto zero quadratically and linearly (respectively) with the\ndistance to the boundary.\nWe begin with an analysis of the homogeneous unbounded case. The statistics of a short-correlated in time\nGaussian velocity is completely characterized by its pair\ncorrelation function\nhv\u03b1 (t1 , r)v\u03b2 (t2 , 0)i = \u03b4(t1 \u2212 t2 ) [V0 \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 K\u03b1\u03b2 (r)] , (2)\n\u0010\nr\u03b1 r\u03b2 \u0011 d \u2212 1\nr\n+\nW (r)\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 , (3)\nK\u03b1\u03b2 \u2261 W \u2032 (r) \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 2\n2\nr\n2\nwhere d is dimensionality of space, V0 is a constant\ncharacterizing fluctuations of the velocity at the integral\nscale, Lv , and W (r) is a function, which determines the\nscale-dependence of velocity fluctuations. To describe\nboth viscous and inertial ranges, we introduce\nW = Dr2 /[1 + (r/\u03b7)\u03b3 ] ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere D stands for the amplitude of the velocity fluctuations and \u03b3 characterizes the velocity scaling in the\ninertial interval. The Kolmogorov scale \u03b7 separates the\ninertial and viscous intervals.\nThe diffusive length is now\np\n\u03ba/D. Measuring time, t, in the\nexpressed as rd =\nunits of 1/D, one replaces D by unity in all the forthcoming formulas. The object we examine here is the simultaneous pair correlation function of the passive scalar,\nF (t, r) = h\u03b8(t, r)\u03b8(t, 0)i, which is the simplest non-zero\ncorrelation function in the homogeneous case. Under the\nassumption of isotropy one derives from Eqs. (1-3)\n\b\n(5)\n\u2212 r1\u2212d \u2202r rd\u22121 [W (r) + \u03ba] \u2202r F\u03bb = \u03bbF\u03bb ,\n\nwhere F\u03bb (r) is the Laplace transform of F (t, r) with respect to t. The operator on the left-hand side of Eq. (5)\nis self-adjoint\nand non-negative (with respect to the meaR\nsure dr rd\u22121 and under condition that F (r) is smooth\nat the origin and \u2202r FR (r = 0) = 0).\nWe assume that dr \u03b8 = 0 (the Corrsin invariant\nis zero), and also, that initially the scalar is correlated at the scale r0 from the viscous-convective range,\n\nrd \u226a r0 \u226a \u03b7, i.e. F (0, r) is \u2248 F (0, 0) at r < r0 and\ndecays fast enough at r > r0 . Then some part of the\ninitial evolution of F (t, r) is not distinguishable from the\ndecay in the pure Batchelor case, described by the limit\n\u03b7 \u2192 \u221e in Eq.(4). Let us briefly describe this initial\nstage of the dacay.\nThe solutions of Eq. (5) are power\u221a\n\u00b1 d2 /4\u2212\u03bb\u2212d/2\n, outside the diffusive range,\nlike, F\u03bb \u221d r\nr \u226b rd . The functions are normalizable only if \u03bb > d2 /4.\nTherefore there is a gap in the spectrum (0 < \u03bb < d2 /4\nare forbidden). The existence of this gap guarantees an\nexponential decay of F (t, r) with time. This feature is,\nof course, in agreement with the previous analysis of the\npure Batchelor case [7, 8]. A complete set of functions\nat r \u226b rd is F\u03bb = r\u2212d/2 cos[\u03b1k + k ln(r/rd )], where k\nis a positive number related to \u03bb via \u03bb = d2 /4 + k 2 ,\nand \u03b1k are phases, determined by matching at r \u223c rd .\nTaking\ninto account the orthogonality condition for F\u03bb ,\nR\ndr rd\u22121 F\u03bb (r)F\u03bb\u2032 (r) = \u03c0\u03b4(k \u2212 k \u2032 )/2, one can express\nF (t, r) via F (0, r). Analysis of this expression leads to\nthe following picture. The correlation function, F (t, r),\ndoes not change at r < r\u2212 = r0 exp(\u2212td). At the scales\nlarger than r\u2212 , F decays exponentially, \u221d exp[\u2212td2 /4].\nNote, that r\u2212 , also, marks the position of the maximum\nof the spatial derivative of F (t, r), \u2202r F (t, r). Therefore,\nr\u2212 (t) describes the front running downscale (from r0 ).\nThe front reaches rd at td = ln(r0 /rd )/d, so that at\nt > td , F (t, r) decays exponentially at all the small scales.\nComplimentary to the front running downscale, there exists another\nR s front running upscale. Indeed, the integral\nquantity, 0 dr rd\u22121 F (t, r), which determines the overall amount of the scalar at all the scales smaller than s,\nachieves its maximum around r+ = r0 exp(td).\nAt t > t\u03b7 \u223c ln[\u03b7/r0 ]/D the pure Batchelor description\nceases to be valid and one does need to account for complete multiscale form of eddy-diffusivity function W (r)\ngiven by Eq. (4). Our further analysis is devoted to this\ngeneral case. The spatial decay of the functions F\u03bb in\nthe multi-scale case is not as steep as in its pure Batchelor one. It is convenient to change to \u221a\na new field, \u03a6\u03bb ,\nF\u03bb = r1\u2212d \u2202r [rd/2 \u03a6\u03bb (z)], where z = 2 \u03bbr\u03b3/2 /\u03b3. The\ngeneral solution of the resulting equation for \u03a6\u03bb (z) is a\nlinear combination\nof the Bessel functions, \u03a6\u03bb = J\u00b1\u03bd (z),\np\nwhere \u03bd = 2 d2 /4 \u2212 \u03bb/\u03b3. If \u03bb < d2 /4, the positive root\nfor \u03a6\u03bb has to be chosen to satisfy the matching conditions at rd . The eigen function is normalizable for any\npositive \u03bb, so that even the smallest positive \u03bb are not\nforbidden. The lack of the gap in the spectrum of the\nmulti-scale model means an algebraic in time decay of\nF (t, r), i.e. much slower decay than the one found for\nthe Batchelor-Kraichnan model. We present here the expression for the long-time, t \u226b t\u03b7 , asymptotic behavior\nof F (t, r):\n\nF (t, r) \u221d\n\n\u001a\n\n\u22121\u2212d/\u03b3\n\n[td + ln(r/\u03b7)+(r/\u03b7)\u03b3 /\u03b3]\nt\u22125/4\u2212d/2\u03b3 r\u2212d/2+\u03b3/4 ,\n\n, r \u226a r+ ;\n(6)\nr \u226b r+\n\n\f3\nHere r+ = (\u03b3t)1/\u03b3 stands for position of the front running upscale, r+ lies in the scaling region r+ \u226b \u03b7, where\nthe multi-scale model turns into the so-called Kraichnan\nmodel [19], W \u2192 r2\u2212\u03b3 . (Therefore, it is not surprising, that our result (6) is consistent at r >\n\u223c r+ with the\nexpression for the pair correlation function derived before for the Kraichnan model [17, 18] in the regime of\nzero Corrsin invariant.) Note, that when t \u2212 t\u03b7 is yet\nmoderate in value, the small-scale part of the asymptotic\nexpression (6) is correct only at r \u226b R\u2212 (t) = \u03b7e\u2212td ,\nwhere R\u2212 is the position of the front initiated at t \u223c t\u03b7\nand running downscale from \u03b7. At t \u223c t\u03b7 + ln(\u03b7/rd )/d,\nthe downscale front reaches the dissipative scale, and\nafterwards the expression (6) is correct for any scales\nr \u226b rd . Eq. (6) shows that just like in the pumped\ncase [1, 2, 4] the scalar structure function is logarithmic,\nh[\u03b8(t, r)\u2212\u03b8(t, 0)]2 i \u223c t\u22122\u2212d/\u03b3 ln[r/rd ], at rd \u226a r \u226a \u03b7 and\nlarge times, where, therefore, the time-dependent factor\nat the logarithm can be interpreted as a scalar flux from\nthe inertial range, r >\n\u223c \u03b7, downscale to the viscous range,\n\u03b7.\nr<\n\u223c\nTo conclude, the existence of the inertial region in velocity affects drastically the spatio-temporal distribution\nof the scalar in the viscous range (where the velocity can\nbe approximated by linear profiles). The inertial interval, where the scalar is mainly concentrated, serves as a\nkind of reservoir for the smaller scales. This explains why\nthe decay of scalar correlation function in the viscous is\nmuch slower (algebraic) than in the pure Batchelor case\n(when it would be exponential).\nNow we proceed to the situation of spatially bounded\nflows. Aiming to demonstrate the main qualitative features of the confined geometry, that is strong sensitivity\nof the scalar decay to the peripheral (close to the boundary) part of the flow, we examine a model case of 2d\nchaotic (i.e. consisting of only few spatial harmonics)\nflow inside a disk. (It is, actually, clear that the picture\nof temporal decay and spatial distribution of the scalar,\ndescribed below, is universal, i.e. it applies to a typical chaotic flow confined in a close box, particularly in\n3d.) Incompressible flow in 2d can be characterized by\na stream function \u03c8, then the radial and azimutal components of the velocity are vr = \u2212\u2202\u03c6 \u03c8/r and v\u03c6 = \u2202r \u03c8.\nOur model of \u03c8 is\n\u03c8=\u2212\n\n\u03be1 2\n\u03be2\nr U (r) sin(2\u03c6) + r2 U (r) cos(2\u03c6) ,\n2\n2\nh\u03bei (t1 )\u03bej (t2 )i = 2D\u03b4ij \u03b4(t1 \u2212 t2 ) ,\n\n(7)\n(8)\n\nwhere U (r) is a function of r, finite at the origin,\nU (0) = 1, and becoming zero, together with its first\nderivative, at the disk boundary, r = 1, and \u03be1,2 (t)\nare zero mean short correlated random Gaussian functions. The value of the passive scalar, \u03b8, averaged over\nthe statistics of \u03be, h\u03b8(t, r)i, is the object of our interest here. One examines how the average concentration\nof the scalar evolves with time at different locations r\n\nwithin the disk. The short-correlated feature of the velocity field allows a closed description for h\u03b8i in terms of\na partial differential equation. Considering the spherically symmetric part of h\u03b8i only (asymptotically, at large\ntimes only this varphi-independent part remains essential), and passing from h\u03b8i and r to \u03a5 and q, respectively, where h\u03b8i = r\u22121 \u2202r [r2 \u03a5(t, q)] and q = \u2212 ln r, one\nfinds that the Laplace transform of \u03a5 with respect to t\n(measured, again, in D\u22121 units) satisfies\n(U 2 + \u03bae\u22122q )(\u2202q2 \u03a5\u03bb \u2212 2\u2202q \u03a5\u03bb ) + \u03bb\u03a5\u03bb = 0.\n\n(9)\n\nThe diffusion term is important only at the center of the\ndisk and near the boundaries. Analysis of Eq. (9) is\nstraightforward but bulky. Below we will present only\nselected details of the analysis, aiming to describe the\ngeneral picture of the phenomenon. (The complete account for the derivation details will be published elsewhere [20].)\nIn the bounded flow the decay of passive scalar splits\ninto three distinct stages. The major effect dominating\nthe first stage (just as in the pure Batchelor case, explained by Eq. (9) with U \u2192 1) is formation of elongated structures (stripes) of the scalar in the bulk region\nof the flow. The stripes are getting thinner with time,\ni.e. inhomogeneities of smaller and smaller scales are\nproduced. Once the width of\u221athe stripes decreases down\nto the dissipative scale, rd \u223c \u03ba, the stripes are smeared\nout by diffusion. The stretching-contraction process is\nexponential in time, so that the initial stage when the\nstripes are formed lasts for \u03c41 \u223c ln[1/rd ]. By the end\nof this first stage the scalar is exhausted in the central region of the flow. The stretching rate, however,\nis smaller in the peripheral domain than in the bulk.\nThus the scalar literally remains longer in the peripheral domain. This defines the second, transient, stage.\nAt \u03ba1/4 \u226a q \u2248 1 \u2212\n\u03bb1/4 \u226a\u0011 1, the solution of Eq.\n\u0010 r \u226a\u221a\n(9) is \u03a5\u03bb \u221d q sin \u03b1\u03bb + \u03bbq/U . In the other asympotitc region at q \u226b \u03bb1/4 one can drop the second derivative (with respect to q) and diffusive terms in Eq. (9).\nOne finds that, \u2202q ln \u03a5\u03bb \u223c 1 at q \u223c \u03bb1/4 . Matching\nthose two asymptotic regions at q \u223c \u03bb1/4 we come to the\n\u03b1\u03bb = 0 condition. Once the asymptotic form of the eigenfunction \u03a5\u03bb is known, it is straightforward to restore the\nbehavior of \u03a5(t, q). One finds that \u03a5(t, q)\u221a (and, therefore, h\u03b8i) is concentrated in the \u03b4(t) \u223c 1/ t-small (and\nshrinking with time) vicinity of the boundary. In the domain outside of the shrinking layer the decay is algebraic,\nh\u03b8i \u221d t\u22123/2 q \u22123 . The second stage lasts for \u03c42 \u223c \u03ba\u22121/2 ,\ni.e. until \u03b4(t) shrinks down to rbl = \u03ba1/4 , which is the\nwidth of the diffusive boundary layer. Account for diffusivity in the q \u226a 1 analysis gives yet another matching\ncondition for \u03a5\u03bb , at r \u223c rbl , resulting in formation of a\ndiscrete spectrum for \u03bb. The smallest \u03bb (and therefore\nthe value of the level\nspacing in the discrete spectrum)\n\u221a\nis estimated by \u03ba. (Using the periodic character of\n\n\f4\nthe sin-function, one finds\u221athat the n-th level eigenvalue\n\u03bbn is estimated by \u223c n2 \u03ba at large n.) Therefore, at\nt \u226b \u03c42 , h\u03b8i decays exponentially, \u221d exp(\u2212t/td ), where\ntd \u223c \u03ba\u22121/2 . The smallest \u03bb eigen-function is localized\nat q \u223c rbl . Thus the third (final) stage of evolution is\ncharacterized by the majority of the scalar remaining in\nthe diffusive boundary layer.\nTo conclude, the temporal behavior of the passive\nscalar correlations, predicted by the bounded flow theory, is complicated. It involves two different exponential\nregimes separated by an algebraic one, so that a special accuracy is required in order to quantify the theory\nagainst various experiments in the field.\nThe bounded flow theory can be applied to the experiment of Groisman and Steinberg [12], where the passive scalar is advected through a pipe by dilute-polymersolution flow. The polymer-related elastic instability\nmakes the flow chaotic. The mean flow along the pipe\nis also essential, so that according to the standard Taylor hypothesis, measurements of scalar concentration at\ndifferent positions along the pipe are interpreted as correspondent to different times in an artificial decay problem. Exponential decay of the scalar was reported in [12]\nat long times (long pipes). The theoretical picture explaining the experiment is similar to the one proposed\nabove for the disk. The width of the diffusive boundary\nlayer near the pipe boundaries is estimated by R*P e\u22121/4 ,\nwhere R is the pipe radius and P e is the Peclet number,\nP e = R2 \u03c3/\u03ba and \u03c3 is a typical value of the velocity gradient (P e is \u223c 104 in the conditions of [12]). The characteristic decay time (fixed by the diffusive boundary layer\nwidth) is estimated by td \u223c \u03c3 \u22121 P e1/2 . However, one\nshould be careful when converting this time to the decrement of the passive scalar decay along the direction of\nthe flow (pipe). The average velocity of the flow tends\nto zero near the boundary of the pipe, making the advection near the boundary less efficient than in the bulk.\nAssuming a linear profile of the average velocity near the\nboundary, one gets the following estimate for the law of\nscalar fluctuation decay along the pipe, \u223c exp(\u2212\u03b3z/u0),\nwhere z is the coordinate in the direction of the pipe,\nu0 is the average velocity at the center of the pipe, and\n\u03b3 \u223c \u03c3 P e\u22121/4 . The factor P e\u22121/4 here is a manifestation\nof a slow down of the passive scalar decay in comparison\nwith the pure Batchelor case. The same factor characterizes decay of higher order correlation functions of the\nscalar as well. For example, one can consider the passive\nscalar pair correlation function F (r) near the center of\nthe disk. One finds that F (r) \u221d r\u2212\u03b1 , where \u03b1 is small\nand can be estimated as \u03b1 \u223c Pe\u22121/4 . (Note, that this\nbehavior is almost indistinguishable from the logarithmic one, found for the stationary case [1, 2, 4].) This\nestimations agree with the experimental data of [12].\nLet us now briefly discuss two other available numerical\nand experimental results. Pierrehumbert [13] reported\n\nexponential decay of the scalar correlations in his numerical experiment with chaotic map velocity in a periodic\nbox. This observation is consistent with our results, since\nthe periodic boundary conditions are less restrictive than\nthe zero condition for velocity at the box boundary, and,\ntherefore, should leave a finite gap in the \u03bb-spectrum even\nin the limit \u03ba \u2192 0. In the experiment of Jullien, Castiglione and Tabeling on 2d stationary flow steered by\nmagnets in a finite volume beneath the 2d layer [11], the\ndecay rate of the scalar seems slower than exponential\n(Fig. 2 of [11]). This observation is in agreement with\nthe absence of the gap in the \u03bb-spectrum (at \u03ba \u2192 0) we\nfound for the finite box model.\nThe brevity of this letter does not allow us to discuss effects of intermittency (which manifests in high-order moments of the scalar), of higher order angular harmonics\n(in the disk or pipe geometry), and details of the spatial\ndistribution of the scalar in a variety of other inhomogeneous cases (e.g. periodic flow). This detailed discussion\nis postponed for a longer paper to be published elsewhere\n[20] (where we will also present results of direct numerical\nsimulations of the passive scalar decay for these cases).\nWe thank B.
