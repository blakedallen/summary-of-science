Box 57,\n11080 Belgrade, Serbia\nAbstract\nThe self adjoint operator of time in non-relativistic quantum mechanics is found within the approach where the ordinary Hamiltonian\nis not taken to be conjugate to time. The operator version of the reexpressed Liouville equation with the total Hamiltonian, consisting of\nthe part that is a conventional function of coordinate and momentum\nand the part that is conjugate to time, is considered. The von Neumann equation with quantized time is found and discussed from the\npoint of view of exact time measurement.\nPACS number(s): 03.65.Ca, 03.65.Ta\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nTime in quantum mechanics (QM), as is well known, appears as a c-number\nparameter, not as an operator representing observable. In this way QM\ndiffers from special relativity where time and space coordinates are treated\non an equal footing. Absence of time operator in QM is strongly related\nto the finite lower bound of the energy spectrum. Namely, according to\nPauli, it is not possible to find self adjoint operator which is canonically\nconjugate to Hamiltonian for it has bounded-from-below spectra. Since this\nobjection, there have been many attempts to address time and/or its operator\nin QM. The extensive lists of references one can find in [1-2], while the present\napproach have some concrete similarities with those given in [3-7].\nHere, operator of time t\u0302 is found together with its conjugate one \u015d and\nthese two emerged after their classical mechanics (CM) counterparts (t and\n1\n\n\fs) have been analyzed. As would become obvious, appearance of t\u0302 and \u015d is\nconsistent with the standard QM and t\u0302 is as was expected - self adjoint and\nwith continuous spectra.\nThis article is organized as follows. In Sec. II. discussion of of the position\nof time in CM is given. In Sec. III. the self adjoint time operator, new form\nof dynamical equation of QM and possibility of exact measurement of time\nin QM are analyzed in details. Finally, in Sec. IV. some remarks are given.\n\n2\n\nTime and Dynamical Equation of Classical\nMechanics\n\nIf time and space coordinates should be on an equal footing, then there\nshould be operator of time t\u0302 which has similar commutation relation with\nits conjugate operator, say \u015d, as coordinate q\u0302 has with p\u0302. (Nota bene, it is\nnot guaranteed a priori that the Hamiltonian is conjugate to time, so that is\nthe reason for taking \u015d.) If the Lie bracket of QM, which is ih\u03041 [ , ], of t\u0302 and\n\u015d does not vanish, then the Poisson bracket, being the Lie bracket of CM,\nshould not vanish for t and s, the last being the CM counterpart of \u015d. This\nis necessary since there should be 1-1 correspondence between QM and CM.\nOn the other hand, perhaps the most important place in CM where Poisson\nbracket appears is the Liouville equation:\n\u2202\u03c1\n\u2202H \u2202\u03c1 \u2202H \u2202\u03c1\n= {H, \u03c1} =\n*\n\u2212\n* .\n\u2202t\n\u2202q \u2202p\n\u2202p \u2202q\n\n(1)\n\nIn this expression derivation with respect to s is not (manifestly) present, so\n(it seams that) time and coordinate are not on an equal footing since there\n\u2202\n\u2202\nare \u2202p\nbeside \u2202q\n. However, if \u2202H\n= 1, \u2202H\n= 0 and \u03c1 = \u03c1(q, p, t, s), then the\n\u2202s\n\u2202t\nLHS of (1) is equal to:\n\u2202H \u2202\u03c1 \u2202H \u2202\u03c1\n*\n\u2212\n* .\n(2)\n\u2202s \u2202t\n\u2202t \u2202s\nIf (2) is taken instead of the LHS of (1), then the complete Liouville equation\nis:\n\u2202H \u2202\u03c1 \u2202H \u2202\u03c1\n*\n\u2212\n*\n=\n\u2202s \u2202t\n\u2202t \u2202s\n\u2202H \u2202\u03c1 \u2202H \u2202\u03c1\n*\n\u2212\n* .\n(3)\n=\n\u2202q \u2202p\n\u2202p \u2202q\n2\n\n\fNow, one can introduce:\n{, }q,p =\n\n\u2202 \u2202\n\u2202 \u2202\n*\n\u2212\n* ,\n\u2202q \u2202p \u2202p \u2202q\n\n(4)\n\n\u2202 \u2202\n\u2202 \u2202\n*\n+\n* ,\n\u2202t \u2202s \u2202s \u2202t\n\n(5)\n\n{, }t,s = \u2212\nand\n\n{, }W = {, }q,p \u2212 {, }t,s ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhich act on ordered pair (A(q, p, t, s), B(q, p, t, s)). Obviously, in (6) coordinate and time are on an equal footing and one can reexpress (3) as:\n{H, \u03c1}W = 0.\n\n(7)\n\n= 1 coordinate and time can be equally treated in the generalSo, if \u2202H\n\u2202s\nized Liouville equation (7). Therefore, it is necessary to deduce the relation\nbetween H and s. The first choice is H = s, the meaning of which is that\nHamilton function is the conjugate variable to time in CM. But, this would\nimply that the Hamiltonian is the conjugate observable to time in QM. Assuming this, one would find oneself faced with the problem of time in QM,\nwhich was mentioned above. Therefore, H is not equal to s, but:\nH = H(q, p) + s.\n\n(8)\n\nWith this form of Hamilton function one should proceed in quantization in\norder to avoid collision with well known facts of QM. But, before addressing\nquantization of the above proposed formalism, few comments are in order.\nDue to (8), s is present in (7), but it is ineffective in sense that solutions of\nthis dynamical equation are:\n\u03c1(q, p, t, s) = \u03c1(q, p, t)\u03b4(s \u2212 so ).\n\n(9)\n\n\u03b4(s \u2212 so ) in (9) ensures that \u03c1(q, p, t, s) is pure state in case when \u03c1(q, p, t) =\n\u03b4(q \u2212 q(t))\u03b4(p \u2212 p(t)). If for t = ta one calculates the mean value of H(q, p)\naccording to:\nZ Z Z\nH(q, p)\u03c1(q, p, ta , s)dq dp ds,\n(10)\nthen it would be the same as the mean value of H(q, p) calculated for\n\u03c1(q, p, ta ) in standard phase space formalism of CM, where s is not considered. On the other hand, if one calculates the mean value of H(q, p) + s\n3\n\n\ffor (9), then it would differ from (10) in additional so . However, the measurement of energy is formalized by the application of H(q, p), not but by\nH(q, p) + s, so one can take so = 0 since this value is irrelevant for physics.\n\n3\n\nTime and Dynamical Equation of Quantum\nMechanics\n\nRegarding QM, there should be t\u0302 which has continuous spectra. Beside this\noperator, there should be \u015d (and q\u0302 and p\u0302). Since:\n{t, s}t,s = \u22121,\nit should be:\n\n1\n[t\u0302, \u015d] = \u22121.\n(11)\nih\u0304\nOn the other side, existence of q, p, t, s, {, }q,p and {, }t,s resembles the\nsituation within standard CM when the system with two degrees of freedom\nis under consideration (when there are qx , px , qy and py ). So, one can quantize\nthe above given formalism following Dirac and his procedure appropriate\nfor the case of two degrees of freedom. This means that one should take\n\u02c6 p\u0302 \u2297 I,\n\u02c6 I\u02c6 \u2297 t\u0302 and I\u02c6 \u2297 \u015d\nHspace \u2297 Htime for the space where operators q\u0302 \u2297 I,\nact. Due to (11), operators t\u0302 and \u015d in |ti and |si representations should be\n\u2202\n\u2202\nand \u2212ih\u0304 \u2202s\nand s, respectively. Instead of CM Hamilton function\nt and ih\u0304 \u2202t\nH = H(q, p) + s there should be its QM counterpart:\n\u02c6 p\u0302 \u2297 I)\n\u02c6 + I\u02c6 \u2297 \u015d = H(q\u0302, p\u0302) \u2297 I\u02c6 + I\u02c6 \u2297 \u015d.\n\u0124 = H(q\u0302 \u2297 I,\n\n(12)\n\nExcept in the case of free particle, the first part of this Hamiltonian has, as\nin standard QM, discrete bounded-from-below spectrum Ei , while the second\npart has the continuous s.\nWhat remains in transition from CM to QM is to declare what is dynamical equation within this approach. Instead of imitating procedure related to\nvon Neumann equation in case of two degrees of freedom, dynamical equation\nof QM will be reached in another way.\nWithout going into details, in [8] it was shown that it is possible to\nintroduce symmetrized product (ordering rule), denoted by \u25e6, in standard\n4\n\n\fQM in such a way that:\n\u2202 \u0124 \u2202 \u03c1\u0302 \u2202 \u0124 \u2202 \u03c1\u0302\n1\n[\u0124, \u03c1\u0302] =\n\u25e6\n\u2212\n\u25e6 ,\nih\u0304\n\u2202 q\u0302 \u2202 p\u0302\n\u2202 p\u0302 \u2202 q\u0302\n\n(13)\n\nP\n\nwhere \u0124 = m,n q\u0302 m \u25e6 p\u0302n . Immediate consequence of (13) is that the von\nNeumann equation becomes the operator version of the Liouville equation.\nHence, the generalized Liouville equation (7) is the classical mechanical counterpart of the operator version of generalized Liouville equation:\n{\u0124, \u03c1\u0302}W = 0,\n\n(14)\n\nwithin which derivations are with respect to the above given operators, product is the symmetrized one, defined in [8], and where \u0124 is given by (12) while\n\u03c1\u0302 is statistical operator in Hspace \u2297 Htime . As was the case for (7), in (14)\ntime and coordinate are treated equally. From (14) one gets:\n\u2202 \u03c1\u0302\n1\n= [H(q\u0302, p\u0302), \u03c1\u0302],\nih\u0304\n\u2202 t\u0302\n\n(15)\n\nwhere H(q\u0302, p\u0302) is the first term on the RHS of (12). The last equation is the\nvon Neumann equation with quantized time.\nDue to (11), the equation (15) can be reexpressed:\n[\u015d, \u03c1\u0302] = [H(q\u0302, p\u0302), \u03c1\u0302].\n\n(16)\n\nThe solutions of (16) are:\n\u03c1\u0302 =\n\nX\n\n1\n\n1\n\ncij |Ei ihEj | \u2297 e ih\u0304 si t\u0302 |so ihso |e\u2212 ih\u0304 sj t\u0302 =\n\ni,j\n\n=\n\nX\n\ncij |Ei ihEj | \u2297 |s\u2032i ihs\u2032j |,\n\n(17)\n\ni,j\n\nwhere H(q\u0302, p\u0302)|Ei i = Ei |Ei i and:\nsi \u2212 sj = Ei \u2212 Ej .\n\n(18)\n\nIn case when the system under consideration is in a pure state, \u03c1\u0302 becomes:\n|\u03c8ih\u03c8| =\n\nX\n\nci |Ei i \u2297 |si i\n\ni\n\nX\nj\n\n5\n\nc\u2217j hEj | \u2297 hsj |.\n\n(19)\n\n\fAfter substituting this state in (16) and after taking coordinate-time |qi \u2297 |ti\nrepresentation, one arrives to:\nih\u0304\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u03c8(q, t) = H(q, \u2212ih\u0304 )\u03c8(q, t),\n\u2202t\n\u2202q\n\n(20)\n\nwhere \u03c8(q, t) = (hq| \u2297 ht|)|\u03c8i. Obviously, (20) is the Schroedinger equation.\nWithout affecting physical meaning, one can simplify expression (17) by\ntaking so = 0 and si = Ei . Then, in a case when system is in state with sharp\nvalue of energy, \u03c1\u0302 becomes |\u03c8i ih\u03c8i |, where |\u03c8i i = |Ei i \u2297 |Ei i. Needless to say,\nthese two |Ei i's are pretty much different. The first one is the element of\nthe Hilbert space Hspace and it is normalized to one, while the second is the\nelement of the rigged Hilbert space Htime , being normalized to \u03b4(0). When\nH(q\u0302, p\u0302) acts it \"calculates\" Ei from |Ei i \u2208 Hspace , while \u015d just \"reads\" Ei from\n|Ei i \u2208 Htime . When |Ei i \u2208 Htime is taken in the time representation ht|Ei i,\n1\nthen e ih\u0304 Ei t appears. This term emerges in standard QM when the solution\nof Schroedinger equation for a system in the eigenstate of Hamiltonian is\ndiscussed. So, it could be said that the phase factor time dependence of\nstationary state in standard QM actually is the time representation of |Ei i \u2208\nHtime .\nWithin this approach it holds:\n[H(q\u0302, p\u0302) \u2297 I\u02c6 + I\u02c6 \u2297 \u015d, I\u02c6 \u2297 t\u0302] = ih\u0304,\n\n(21)\n\nwhich means that Heisenberg uncertainty relation for total Hamiltonian and\ntime holds. However, what one measures is not the total Hamiltonian, but its\n\u02c6 which commutes with time operator I\u02c6 \u2297 t\u0302. So, one\n\"space\" part H(q\u0302, p\u0302) \u2297 I,\nmay wonder is it possible to measure energy and time and to find them with\nsharp values simultaneously. Assuming that it is possible, it would mean\nthat the system under consideration is in state:\n|Ei ihEi | \u2297 |ta ihta |,\n\n(22)\n\nfor some Ei and ta . But, states of this form do not satisfy dynamical equation.\nOnly the states given by (17) are possible states of physical system and,\nwithin their second factor, eigenstates |si i of \u015d appear. Since hsi |ta i =\n6 1,\none can find ta only with some probability different from one. Therefore,\nthere would be dispersion of time for every system that evolves under the\n6\n\n\faction of some conventional Hamiltonian H(q\u0302, p\u0302) of QM. In other words,\ndynamical equation of QM precludes measurements with sharp values of\ntime. Measurement of time on a system in physically meaningful states,\nwhich are those satisfying von Neumann equation, can not deduce exact\ntime. Measurement of energy, resulting or not in sharp value, is unrelated to\nthis. Of course, the mean value of H(q\u0302, p\u0302) \u2297 I\u02c6 for a system in the state (17),\ncalculated according to:\n\u02c6 \u03c1\u0302)\nTr((H(q\u0302, p\u0302) \u2297 I)\n,\nTr\u03c1\u0302\nis same as the mean value of this Hamiltonian calculated in standard QM\n(where Htime is not taken into account).\n\n4\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nThe variable s was not introduced artificially in CM. Namely, t has to have\nconjugate variable, which means that these two should have non vanishing\n\u2202\n\u2202\nPoisson bracket. Then, there should be \u2202t\nand \u2202s\nwithin some new Poisson\n\u2202\n\u2202\nand \u2202p\nbracket since the ordinary Poisson bracket contains derivatives \u2202q\nthat annihilate both t and s. The Liouville equation, where \"space\" Poisson\n\u2202\nbracket and \u2202t\nare already present, lead one not to introduce, but to uncover\nthe exact form of \"time\" Poisson bracket.\nThe intention here was to respect (more strictly than usually) the request\nto have time and coordinate on an equal footing. The generalized Poisson\nbracket (6), reexpressed Liouville equation (7) and its operator version (14)\nare the results of this intention. On the other hand, (14) offers the possibility\nto unify classical and quantum mechanics. Namely, within some generalized\nframework one can introduce h-dependent (0 \u2264 h \u2264 ho ) operators q\u0302h , p\u0302h ,\nt\u0302h and \u015dh , all of which become commutative for h = 0, representing then\nCM variables, and noncommutative for h = ho , resembling QM. Within\nthat framework, both CM and QM will have the same algebraic structure\n- the above mentioned symmetrized product, Lie bracket - operator version\nof the above given generalized Poisson bracket, and dynamical equation the operator version of generalized Liouville equation. Then, classical and\nquantum mechanics will become completely equal regarding their structures\nand all the difference will rest on the commutativity of involved operators.\n7\n\n\fMoreover, that framework will offer the possibility to connect Newton and\nSchroedinger equations since they will follow from one and the same - the\noperator version of generalized Liouville equation.\nThe existence of the self adjoint operator \u015d with continuous spectrum\nand its presence in total Hamiltonian is followed by time-Hamiltonian uncertainty relation. On the other hand, uncertainty of time is the consequence\nof dynamics. As the solutions of Schroedinger equation in standard QM,\nthe solutions of dynamical equation here time have only within the phase\nfactors, the consequence of which is its uncertainty. (Present approach only\noffers more transparent argumentation on the impossibility to comprehend\nexact time.) Of course, this similarity, as well as the others, does not come\nas surprise since one of the major requests of this approach was to keep all\nimportant features of standard QM formalism.\nNow, one can approach to the operator of time in reversed order. Namely,\n\u2202\non the LHS of Schroedinger equation (20) one can recognize ih\u0304 \u2202t\nas the time\nrepresentation of the operator that is conjugate to time. Then, there should\nexist the operator of time, which is t within the same representation. Finally,\none should take Htime , beside Hspace , where these two operators act since the\ntime and coordinate within \u03c8(q, t) are mutually independent. Taken in this\nway, it appears that the operator of time was implicitly present in QM all\nthe time, but it has been just unnoticed.\n\n5\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nThe work on this article was supported by the Serbian Ministry of science\nand technology development through the projects OI 141031 and OI 146012.\n\nReferences\n[1] J.
