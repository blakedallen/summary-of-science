In particular, some simple models of\nstructure formation studied in the literature seem to indicate that this is indeed possible,\nand it has also been suggested that the perturbed FLRW framework is no longer a good\napproximation during structure formation, when the density contrast becomes nonlinear. In\nthis work we attempt to clarify the situation to some extent, using a fully relativistic model\nof pressureless spherical collapse. We find that whereas averaging during structure formation\ncan lead to acceleration via a selective choice of averaging domains, the acceleration is not\npresent when more generic domains are used for averaging. Further, we show that for most\nof the duration of the collapse, matter velocities remain small, and the perturbed FLRW\nform of the metric can be explicitly recovered, in the structure formation phase. We also\ndiscuss the fact that the magnitude of the average effects of inhomogeneities depends on the\nscale of averaging, and while it may not be completely negligible on intermediate scales, it\nis expected to remain small when averaging on suitably large scales.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nUnderstanding the origin of Dark Energy is undoubtedly one of the most important problems\nin cosmology today. Recently, several workers in the field (including the present authors)\n[1, 2, 3, 4], have supported the hypothesis that the acceleration of the scale factor in the\nstandard Friedmann-Lema\u0131\u0302tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmologies, might be attributed to\nthe effects of averaging over inhomogeneities in the real Universe. It is known that explicit\naveraging of the Einstein equations leads to non-trivial corrections [5, 6, 7]. These corrections\nor \"backreaction\", it is argued, can mimic a Dark Energy term in the Cosmological equations.\nSpecifically, some simple models have been presented which demonstrate how such an effect\nmay arise [1].\nOn the other hand, it has also been argued that as long as the standard perturbed FLRW\npicture for the metric of the Universe is a good approximation, any effects of averaging over the\ninhomogeneous perturbations must remain small (see, e.g. Refs. [8, 9, 10, 11]). The counter\ngiven to this argument is that the perturbed FLRW framework is expected to break down\naround the time of structure formation [1]. That N -body simulations do not demonstrate any\nsuch breakdown is attributed to the fact that these simulations always work in the Newtonian\nlimit of General Relativity (GR), usually employing periodic boundary conditions, and that\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nE-mail: aseem@tifr.res.in\nE-mail: tpsingh@tifr.res.in\n\n\fthe backreaction due to averaging under such conditions can be shown to vanish [12]. Further,\nsince the evolution of the background scale factor is fixed in the simulations, backreaction effects\nwould not be visible even if present.\nThis situation clearly demands some clarification. One expects that as long as gravitational\nfields are weak, the perturbed FLRW framework should work well. Is the weak field approximation then actually breaking down during structure formation? If so, then clearly a radical\nrethink of the approach to Cosmology is in order. If not, on the other hand, then one needs\nto understand how simple models such as the one presented by R\u00e4s\u00e4nen [1] can achieve an\nacceleration upon averaging during structure formation.\nIn this paper we will attempt to address these issues. We employ a simple but fully relativistic model of spherical collapse, with appropriate initial conditions imposed. We will show\nthat the effect observed by R\u00e4s\u00e4nen can actually be attributed to a very selective choice of\naveraging domain, and that in fact the effect is not present when a more generic averaging\ndomain is chosen. However, we do find that the effect of averaging inhomogeneities may not\nbe completely negligible. In particular we see \u223c 10% deviations of the effective deceleration\nparameter to be defined below, from the expected FLRW value, on the scale over which we\ndefine our averaged quantities. This is in line with the findings of Li and Schwarz [13, 14] in the\ncontext of averaging of perturbative inhomogeneities. To support these results, we will show\nthat at any stage of the collapse, if matter velocities are small, then the weak field conditions\nhold and one can explicitly recover the perturbed FLRW form of the metric. We will see that\nmatter velocities do, in fact, remain small for most of the duration of the collapse. We will\nalso present an argument explaining the origin of the \u223c 10% effect from perturbative metric\ninhomogeneities on the scales at hand, and argue that in the real universe, the averaging scale\nis expected to be large enough for these effects to be much smaller.\nWe have organised the paper as follows. In section 2 we will set up our model for the\nspherical collapse, and compare its results with those obtained by R\u00e4s\u00e4nen. In section 3 we\nwill show how the perturbed FLRW metric is recovered, and we will conclude in section 4 with\na discussion of further tests of the backreaction argument.\n\n2\n\nSpherical Collapse : Setting up the model\n\nBefore we describe the model we use, it will help to recall the model used by R\u00e4s\u00e4nen [1], which\nis what we wish to compare with. R\u00e4s\u00e4nen's model can be summarized as follows : one considers\ntwo disjoint regions, one overdense and the other completely empty, each evolving according to\nthe FLRW evolution equations. (The embedding of these regions in an FLRW background, and\nthe behaviour of the region between these two regions, is not considered.) The scale factor in the\noverdense region therefore behaves as a1 \u221d (1 \u2212 cos u) with t \u221d (u \u2212 sin u), and the scale factor\nin the empty region behaves as a2 \u221d t. It is then straightforward to show that if one defines a\nvolume averaged scale factor by a3 \u2261 a31 + a32 , then the effective deceleration parameter given by\nq \u2261 \u2212(\u00e4a)/\u02272 becomes negative (indicating acceleration) around the time that the overdense\nregion turns around and starts collapsing. In what follows, we will attempt to reconstruct such\na situation more rigorously, with appropriate matching and initial conditions taken care of.\n\n2.1\n\nThe LTB solution\n\nWe will employ a model containing spherically symmetric pressureless \"dust\", with the energymomentum tensor given by\nTab = diag(\u03c1(t, r), 0, 0, 0) .\n(1)\n\n2\n\n\fThe line element of interest is hence the Lema\u0131\u0302tre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) metric [17] given in\nsynchronous and comoving coordinates, by\nds2 = \u2212dt2 +\n\nR\u20322 dr 2\n+ R2 d\u03a92 ,\n1 \u2212 k(r)r 2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere R(t, r) is the area radius of a shell of matter labelled by the comoving radius r, and k(r)\nis a function of integration to be determined by the initial conditions. (A prime and a dot refer\nto derivatives with respect to r and t respectively. We set the speed of light c = 1, except when\ndisplaying numerical results where we will explicitly account for factors of c.) The equations of\nmotion are\n2GM (r)\n\u2212 k(r)r 2 ,\nR\nM \u2032 (r)\n\u03c1(t, r) =\n,\n4\u03c0R2 R\u2032\n\u1e582 =\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nwhere M (r) is another function of integration which can be determined from the initial density\nprofile once a scaling freedom in the coordinate r is fixed. The spherical collapse model has\nbeen extensively studied in the literature in the context of structure formation [18]. However,\nto the best of our knowledge, the issue of whether or not the collapse situation can be recast\nas perturbed FLRW, has not been discussed.\nThe solutions to Eqn. (3) depend on the sign of the function k(r), and can be given in\nparametric form as\n\u0013\n\u0012\n9GM (r) 1/3\n(t \u2212 ts (r))2/3 , for k(r) = 0 ,\n(5a)\nR(r, t) =\n2\nGM (r)\nGM (r)\n(cosh \u03b7 \u2212 1) ; t\u2212ts (r) =\n(sinh \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7) , 0 \u2264 \u03b7 < \u221e , for k(r) < 0 ,\n2\n\u2212k(r)r\n(\u2212k(r)r 2 )3/2\n(5b)\nGM (r)\nGM (r)\n(\u03b7 \u2212 sin \u03b7) , 0 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 2\u03c0, for k(r) > 0 .\n(1 \u2212 cos \u03b7) ; t \u2212 ts (r) =\nR=\nk(r)r 2\n(k(r)r 2 )3/2\n(5c)\nThe function ts (r) appearing above is completely determined once k(r) and M (r) are known\nand a scaling choice for r is made. Since we will always start the evolution at t = ti > ts (r),\nthis function will be of little physical relevance, except to ensure consistency at t = ti .\nR=\n\n2.2\n\nInitial conditions\n\nWhile choosing the initial density, velocity and coordinate scaling profiles, we make the important assumption that at initial time, a well-defined global background FLRW solution can be\nidentified, with scale factor a(t), Hubble parameter H(t) and density \u03c1\u0304(t). This is reasonable\nsince the CMB data (combined with the Copernican principle) assure us that inhomogeneities\nat the last scattering epoch were at the level of 10 parts per million. This assumption plays\na crucial role in deciding which regions are overdense and will eventually collapse, and which\nregions will keep expanding (see also the first paper in Ref. [4] for a discussion on this point).\n\u2022 Initial density profile \u03c1(ti , r) :\nThe initial density is chosen to be\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 (1 + \u03b4\u2217 ),\n\u03c1(ti , r) = \u03c1\u0304i\n(1 \u2212 \u03b4v ),\n\uf8f3\n1,\n3\n\nr < r\u2217\nr\u2217 < r < rv\nr > rv ,\n\n(6)\n\n\fwhere \u03c1\u0304i = \u03c1\u0304(ti ). Initially, the region r < r\u2217 is assumed to contain a tiny overdensity and\nthe region r\u2217 < r < rv , an underdensity. In other words,\n0 < \u03b4\u2217 , \u03b4v \u226a 1 .\n\n(7)\n\nThe discontinuities in the initial density profile can be smoothed out by replacing the\nstep functions appropriately. We will not do this here, since the step functions make\ncalculations very simple. This is not expected to affect the qualitative features of our\nfinal results.\n\u2022 Initial conditions on scaling and velocities :\nWe match the initial velocity and coordinate scaling to the global background solution,\nby requiring\nR(ti , r) = ai r ,\n\n(8)\n\n\u1e58(ti , r) = ai Hi r ,\n\n(9)\n\nwith ai and Hi denoting the initial values of the scale factor and Hubble parameter\nrespectively of the global background. This amounts to setting the initial velocities to\nmatch the Hubble flow, ignoring initial peculiar velocities. This is only a convenient\nchoice and the introduction of initial peculiar velocities is not expected to modify our\nfinal results qualitatively.\nFor the FLRW background we consider an Einstein-deSitter (EdS) solution with scale factor\nand Hubble parameter given by\na(t) = (t/t0 )2/3 ; t0 = 2/(3H0 ) ,\n\n(10)\n\nH(t) \u2261 \u0227/a = 2/(3t) ,\n\n(11)\n\nwith t0 denoting the present epoch. ai fixes the initial time as\n3/2\n\nti = 2/(3H0 )ai\n\n.\n\n(12)\n\nWe will always use ai = 10\u22123 , so that the initial conditions are being set around the CMB last\nscattering epoch; in general ai must be treated as one of the parameters in the problem. The\ninitial EdS background density is given in terms of H0 and ai as\n\u03c1\u0304i =\n\n2.3\n\n3\nH 2 a\u22123 .\n8\u03c0G 0 i\n\n(13)\n\nMass function M(r) and curvature function k(r)\n\nWe now have enough information to fix M (r) and k(r). Using Eqn. (4) at initial time together\nwith the scaling in Eqn. (8) gives us\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4 1 + \u03b4\u2217 ,\u0010 0 < r < r\u0011\u2217\n1 2 3\uf8f2\n(14)\n1 + \u03b4v (rc /r)3 \u2212 1 , r\u2217 < r < rv\nGM (r) = H0 r\n\uf8f4\n2\n\u0001\n\uf8f3\n1 + (\u03b4v /r 3 ) rc3 \u2212 rv3 , r > rv ,\n\nwhere we have defined a \"critical\" radius rc by the equation\n\u0012\n\nrc\nr\u2217\n\n\u00133\n\n=1+\n\n4\n\n\u03b4\u2217\n.\n\u03b4v\n\n(15)\n\n\fThe significance of rc will become apparent shortly. Using the initial conditions Eqns. (8) and\n(9) in the evolution equation (3) at initial time, gives\nk(r)r 2 =\n\n2GM (r)\n\u2212 a2i Hi2 r 2 ,\nai r\n\n(16)\n\nwith Hi2 = H02 a\u22123\ni , and hence\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u03b4\u2217 ,\u0010 r < r\u2217 \u0011\nk(r) =\n\u03b4v (rc /r)3 \u2212 1 , r\u2217 < r < rv\nai \uf8f4\n\u0001\n\uf8f3\n(\u03b4v /r 3 ) rc3 \u2212 rv3 , r > rv .\nH02\n\n(17)\n\nThe significance of rc is now clarified. Since \u03b4\u2217 , \u03b4v > 0, we have rc > r\u2217 by definition (Eqn.\n(15)). The following possibilities arise :\n\u2022 If rc > rv , then k(r) > 0 for all r, and every shell will ultimately collapse, including the\n\"void\" region r\u2217 < r < rv .\n\u2022 If rc < rv , then k(r) > 0 for r < rc and changes sign at r = rc . Hence, the region\nr\u2217 < r < rc will collapse even though it is underdense, while the region r > rc will expand\nforever.\n\u2022 If rc = rv , then the \"void\" exactly compensates for the overdensity, and the universe\nis exactly EdS for r > rv . [GM (r) = (1/2)H02 r 3 and k(r) = 0.] Also the \"void\" will\neventually collapse.\nClearly the most interesting case for us is the one with rc < rv , and we will hence make this\nchoice for our model. We realize that the model as it stands is not a very realistic depiction\nof the (nearly spherical) voids we see in our Universe [15], since these voids are seen to be\nsurrounded by \"walls\" of matter. However, our goal is to describe two regions, one of which\ncollapses while the other expands ever more rapidly, and our model is capable of doing so while\nretaining its fully relativistic character.\nAlthough we have set up the model for all values of the radial coordinate r, hereon we will\nconcentrate on the region 0 < r < rv . One reason is that most of the interesting dynamics\ntakes place in this region. Another is that the region r > rv develops shell-crossing singularities\ndue to the sharp rise in density across r = rv . A more realistic model would be able to\nincorporate the pressures that are expected to build up when a shell-crossing occurs ([16], see\nalso the discussion in section 4 below), but the LTB model is limited in this respect due to its\npressureless character. We will therefore ignore the region r > rv .\n\n2.4\n\nThe solution in the region 0 < r < rv\n\nThe region of interest can be split into three parts : Region 1 = {0 < r < r\u2217 }, Region 2\n= {r\u2217 < r < rc } and Region 3 = {rc < r < rv }.

The\ncrossover from Region 2 to Region 3 can be shown to be smooth, by considering the limits\nr \u2192 rc\u2212 and r \u2192 rc+ or equivalently \u03b5 \u2192 0\u2212 and \u03b5 \u2192 0+ .

By appropriately\nchoosing a value of \u03b4\u2217 , we can arrange for the turnaround of Region 1 to occur either before or\nafter the present epoch.\nIn Table 1 we have listed the parameter values which we will use frequently in displaying\nplots. Along with the parameter set {ai , H0 , \u03b4\u2217 , \u03b4v , r\u2217 , rv }, we have also listed the values of the\nderived quantities {rc , ti , t0 , tturn } and speed of light c in units of MpcGyr\u22121 . We have also\nshown the values of the present day physical area radius R(t0 , r) at r = r\u2217 and r = rv . The\ndensity contrasts are to be understood to reflect the inhomogeneities in the dark matter density\nclose to last scattering, and not the inhomogeneities of the baryons which were much smaller\n[19, 20].\nIn Fig. 1 we have shown the evolution of the density contrast \u03b4(t, r) defined in the usual\nway by\n\u03c1(t, r)\n,\n(24)\n1 + \u03b4(t, r) =\n\u03c1\u0304(t)\nfor the parameter choices of Table 1, for which one has tturn /t0 \u2243 0.72, so that the collapse is\nwell under way in Region 1 at the present epoch. The two panels show the contrast for two\nrepresentative values of r, one in Region 1 and the other in Region 3.\nFor clarity, we define the volume of each of our three comoving regions separately, as\nZ rc\nZ rv\nZ r\u2217\nR2 R\u2032\nR2 R\u2032\nR2 R\u2032\np\np\np\ndr ; V2 \u2261 4\u03c0\ndr ; V3 \u2261 4\u03c0\ndr .\nV1 \u2261 4\u03c0\n1 \u2212 k(r)r 2\n1 \u2212 k(r)r 2\n1 \u2212 k(r)r 2\nr\u2217\nrc\n0\n(25)\nThe total volume of the region is used to define a volume averaged scale factor as\na(t) \u2261\n\n\u0012\n\nV (t)\nV (t0 )\n\n\u00131/3\n\n; V (t) \u2261 V1 (t) + V2 (t) + V3 (t) ,\n\n7\n\n(26)\n\n\f14\n\n0\n-0.1\n-0.2\n-0.3\n\u03b4 -0.4\n-0.5\n-0.6\n-0.7\n-0.8\n\n12\n10\n\u03b4\n\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n( t/t0 )\n\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n( t/t0 )\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 1: The evolution of the density contrast \u03b4(t, r), using parameter values from Table 1 evaluated\nat (a) r = r\u2217 /2 in Region 1 and (b) r = (rc + rv )/2 in Region 3.\nand hence an effective deceleration parameter q given by\nq\u2261\u2212\n\n\u00e4a\nV\u0308 V\n.\n=2\u22123\n2\n\u0227\nV\u0307 2\n\n(27)\n\nOn the other hand, we note that R\u00e4s\u00e4nen's model can be mimicked more closely by ours, if\nwe simply remove the Region 2, by hand. By doing so we are left with two disjoint regions,\neach spherically symmetric, one of which is collapsing and the other expanding ever rapidly and\nbecoming ever emptier. There is no physical reason to throw away Region 2 in this manner, but\nfor the sake of comparison we will define a \"modified\" scale factor amod and it's corresponding\ndeceleration parameter qmod by\namod (t) \u2261\n\n\u0012\n\nV1 (t) + V3 (t)\nV1 (t0 ) + V3 (t0 )\n\n\u00131/3\n\n; qmod \u2261 \u2212\n\n\u00e4mod amod\n.\n\u02272mod\n\n(28)\n\nNote that the normalisation of the scale factor is irrelevant in defining the deceleration parameter. In Fig. 2 we plot q(t) and qmod (t), for several sets of initial conditions which are\nclose to our \"base set\" listed in Table 1 (except for Fig. 2d which has a large value for \u03b4v )1 .\nThe various integrals involved in computing V (t), etc. were performed using the NIntegrate\nroutine of Mathematica. To generate the plots we used the numerical derivative routine ND of\nMathematica. The various initial conditions correspond to turnaround times that are slightly\ngreater than, or slightly less than, or significantly less than the present epoch. The idea here is\nto demonstrate that the results are valid regardless of whether the collapse has just begun or is\nwell under way at the present epoch. We see that while the modified scale factor does accelerate\nas in R\u00e4s\u00e4nen's model, the scale factor a(t) which is the more natural choice in our situation,\ndoes not show this effect. The reason for this can be understood as follows. The Region 2 is\nof a rather peculiar nature \u2013 it is underdense initially and becomes emptier with time, however\nits evolution is closely linked to that of the overdense Region 1. Namely, the whole of Region 2\n(except its boundary at r = rc ), is dragged along with Region 1 and eventually turns around,\ninstead of expanding away to infinity like its counterpart Region 3. Now, if one ignores Region\n2, then R\u00e4s\u00e4nen's arguments about the remaining two regions stand \u2013 one region is contracting\nand the other is expanding faster than the global mean, and this stand-off leads to an acceleration of the effective scale factor amod , as we see in the plots of Fig. 2. But if we account for\nRegion 2 as well, then we bring in a counter-balancing influence of a large underdense volume\n1\nBoth curves in Fig. 2d begin at q \u223c 0.5 at t = ti . To enhance the contrast between the curves, we have\nplotted them for times t > 0.15tturn .

The dashed lines correspond to\nqmod and the solid lines to q. The x-axis shows t/tturn , where tturn is the time at which Region 1 turns\naround, and is different for each plot. The values for ai , H0 and c are the same as those listed in Table\n1. [Both curves in Fig. 2d begin at q \u223c 0.5 at t = ti .]\nwhich is expanding slower than average, and this reduces the accelerating influence of Region\n3 to the point of making the effect completely disappear. Note that at late times, the volume\nof Region 1 contributes negligibly to the total volume, and the volumes of regions 2 and 3 are\ncomparable.\nThe figures (2a)-(2c) show that while the full deceleration parameter q does not change sign,\nit does deviate from the EdS value of (1/2), by an amount of the order of \u223c 10%. This indicates\nthat while backreaction may not be large enough to cause the scale factor to accelerate, it may\nstill lead to effects which are not completely negligible.\nWe wish to highlight two points. First, it is very important to note the role played by\nthe initial conditions in this entire excercise. The function k(r) is defined in a continuous\nfashion once the initial density, velocity and coordinate scaling are given, and k(r) then decides\nwhich shells will eventually collapse and which will not. The continuity of k(r) assures us that\nin models such as ours, with an overdensity surrounded by an underdensity, the underdense\nregion will always contain a subregion in which k(r) > 0. We see therefore that the existence\nof Region 2, is a generic feature not restricted to our specific choice of discontinuous initial\ndensity or vanishing initial peculiar velocities. Further, as we see in Fig. 2d, it is possible to\nmake q deviate even more significantly from the EdS value than the \u223c 10% effect of the first\nthree figures, but this requires an unnaturally high value of \u03b4v & 0.01 (the figure has \u03b4v = 0.05),\nwhich contradicts CMB data.\nSecondly, one may argue about the \"naturalness\" of choosing one set of regions over another\nset, in order to compute volumes. But this itself places the physicality of the acceleration effect\ninto question \u2013 if one has to judiciously choose a specific set of averaging domains in order to\n\n9\n\n\fobtain acceleration on average, then the effect would appear to be an artifact of this choice\nrather than something which observers would see.\nHaving seen that the average behaviour of the full region 0 < r < rv is close to EdS, we can\nask whether one can explicitly show that the metric for this system is actually close to FLRW.\nWe answer this in the affirmative in the next section.\n\n3\n\nTransforming to Perturbed FLRW form\n\nWe ask whether the metric (2) can be brought to the perturbed FLRW form with scalar perturbations, at any arbitrary stage of the collapse. Namely, we want a coordinate transformation\n(t, r) \u2192 (t\u0303, r\u0303) such that the metric in the new coordinates is\n\u0001\nds2 = \u2212(1 + 2\u00c3)dt\u03032 + a2 (t\u0303)(1 + 2\u03c8\u0303) dr\u0303 2 + r\u0303 2 d\u03a92 ,\n(29)\nwith at least the conditions\n\n| \u00c3 |\u226a 1 ;\n\n| \u03c8\u0303 |\u226a 1 ,\n\n(30)\n\nbeing satisfied. We will ignore conditions on the derivatives of \u03c8\u0303 and \u00c3 for now (see the end\nof Section 3.2). The scale factor is the EdS solution, with t\u0303 as the argument. The coordinate\nr\u0303 is comoving with the (fictitious) background Hubble flow, but not with the matter itself.\nOn physical grounds we expect that this transformation should be possible as long as the\ngravitational field is weak and matter velocity is small. We will see below that this is exactly\nwhat happens. In the new coordinates, all matter shells labelled by r\u0303 expand with the Hubble\nflow, with a superimposed peculiar velocity.\nSince we want r\u0303 to be comoving with the background, the natural choice for this coordinate\nwould be r\u0303 \u223c R/a, at least at early times. Also, we need to account for the local spatial\ncurvature induced by the initial conditions. As an ansatz for the coordinate transformation\ntherefore, we consider the equations\nr\u0303 =\n\nR(t, r)\n(1 + \u03be(t, r)) ,\na(t)\n\n(31a)\n\nt\u0303 = t + \u03be 0 (t, r) ,\n\n(31b)\n\nwhere \u03be(t, r) and \u03be 0 (t, r) are expected to satisfy\n| \u03be | \u226a 1 ; | \u03be0H | \u226a 1 .\n\n(32)\n\nThis form of the transformation keeps us close to the standard gauge transformation of cosmological perturbation theory, while still accounting for the deviations in the evolution from\nthe background FLRW, caused by structure formation. We will show that a self-consistent\ntransformation exists, which preserves the conditions (30) and (32) for most of the evolution.\nWe will use the metric transformation rule given by\ng\u0303ab (x\u0303)\n\n\u2202 x\u0303a \u2202 x\u0303b\n= gij (x) ,\n\u2202xi \u2202xj\n\n(33)\n\nand expand to leading order in the small functions \u03be, \u03be 0 H, \u00c3, \u03c8\u0303 and also k(r)r 2 which, as we\nsee from Eqn. (17), remains small in the entire region of interest. The relations in Eqn. (33)\nmust be analysed for the cases (ij) = {(tt), (tr), (rr), (\u03b8\u03b8)}, in each of the three regions. (The\nremaining cases can be shown to lead to trivial or non-independent relations.) The analysis is\nsimilar to the standard gauge transformation analysis in relativistic perturbation theory [19].\nSince the calculations involved are straightforward but tedious, we will only present an outline\n10\n\n\fof the calculation and highlight certain issues. At the end we will present equations for all three\nregions and numerically show that the transformation is well-behaved in the regime of interest.\nThe cases (ij) = (\u03b8\u03b8) and (rr) are easily analysed and lead to\n\u03c8\u0303 = \u2212\u03be 0 H \u2212 \u03be ,\nand\n\n1\n\u03be = k(r)r 2\n2\n\u2032\n\n\u0012\n\nR\u2032\nR\n\n\u0013\n\n(34)\n\n.\n\n(35)\n\nThe cases (ij) = (tr) and (tt) both require | \u2202t r\u0303 |\u226a 1 for consistency (since the RHS of Eqn.\n(33) in these cases has no zero order term to balance a large \u2202t r\u0303). Note that since t is the\nproper time of each matter shell, the quantity \u2202t r\u0303 is simply the velocity of matter in the (t\u0303, r\u0303)\nframe (which is comoving with the Hubble flow). In other words,\n\u1e7d \u2261\n\n\u2202r\u0303\n,\n\u2202t\n\n(36)\n\nis the radial comoving peculiar velocity of the matter shells in the (t\u0303, r\u0303) frame. We will soon\nsee that whereas the quantities \u03be and \u03be 0 behave roughly as \u223c (H0 r)2 , the peculiar velocity a\u1e7d\nbehaves roughly as \u223c (H0 r). We will therefore treat (a\u1e7d)2 as a small quantity of the same order\nas \u03be, etc. The case (ij) = (tr) then leads to\n\u03be 0\u2032 = a\u1e7dR\u2032 ,\n\n(37)\n\nand the case (ij) = (tt) gives\n\n1\n(38)\n\u00c3 = \u2212\u03be\u0307 0 + (a\u1e7d)2 .\n2\nThe equations (34), (35), (37), and (38) are valid in the entire range 0 < r < rv , provided the\npeculiar velocity remains small in magnitude. The comoving peculiar velocity is given by\n\u0012 \u0013\nR\n\u1e7d = \u2202t\n,\n(39)\na\nwhere we have assumed for consistency that |\u2202t (R/a)| \u226a 1 and have dropped the term (R/a)\u03be \u0307\nsince it is expected to be of higher order than \u2202t (R/a). (This can be seen from simple dimensional considerations \u2013 we have \u2202t (R/a) \u223c HR/a, and since, from Eqns. (35) and (17),\n\u03be \u223c (HR)2 , we also have (R/a)\u03be \u0307 \u223c (HR)3 /a.)

Panel (a) shows the evolution from ti to t0 , and panel (b) shows the early time evolution upto\nt = 0.0075t0. The dotted lines correspond to f1 (u(t)) and the solid lines to f2 (u(t)) (see Eqns. (44) and\n(45) for definitions). We see that at early times, \u00c3 \u2243 \u2212\u03c8\u0303. Since (H0 r\u2217 /c) \u223c 0.001, \u03c8\u0303 and \u00c3 remain\nsmall.\nWe see that they remain of order \u223c 1 for most of the evolution, and hence for an overdensity\nspanning a few Mpc, \u03c8\u0303 and \u00c3 are of order \u223c 10\u22126 in Region 1. By expanding f1 (u) and f2 (u) in\nthe parameter u around its initial value ui , one can show that at early times one has \u00c3 \u2243 \u2212\u03c8\u0303,\nas expected in the linear theory. Fig. 4b shows this behaviour. However, the relative difference\nbetween \u00c3 and \u2212\u03c8\u0303 grows quickly and (for the parameters given in Table 1) becomes of the\norder 10\u22122 , by t \u223c 0.02t0 . At the end of Section 3.2 we show that the large relative difference\nbetween \u00c3 and \u2212\u03c8\u0303 (of the order \u223c 50% at late times), is largely due to our choice of setting\nthese functions to zero at the origin. [We note that a difference between these two functions is\nnot in principle surprising since the density contrast in Region 1 grows to order \u223c 1 by t \u223c 0.3t0\n(see Fig. 1a), and departures from the linear theory are expected to become significant even\nbefore this. See, however, Section 4 below. ]\n\n3.2\n\nThe transformation in Regions 2 and 3\n\nThe calculation in Regions 2 and 3 proceeds in a similar fashion as above, but in this case the\nintegrals involved cannot be computed analytically.

The time axis begins at t = 50ti .\nIn Fig. 5, we have plotted the velocity a\u1e7d/c in Regions 2 and 3 for a range of time. It can be\nshown that at the order of approximation we are working at, a\u1e7d changes sign at r = rc . [ Recall\n\u03b5(rc ) = 0 and hence this shell expands exactly like the EdS background. The metric in the\n(t\u0303, r\u0303) coordinates will not be exactly EdS at r = rc , due to our unusual choice of normalisation\nfor \u03be and \u03be 0 at r = 0. This does not pose any problem for our conclusions.]\nIn Fig. 6 we plot \u03c8\u0303 and \u00c3. We see that these functions are well behaved and remain small\nfor the entire region of interest (in space and time). Hence the perturbed FLRW picture is\nindeed valid for this system, even though each region by itself appears to be very different from\nFLRW in the synchronous coordinates comoving with the matter. Due to numerical difficulties\nclose to the initial time t = ti , we have plotted the time axis starting from t = 50ti .\nNote that the magnitude of \u03c8\u0303 and \u00c3 is sensitive to the overall size of the region, determined\nby the value of R(t, rv ). For our parameter choices given in Table 1, the size of the region at\nthe present epoch is \u223c 33Mpc, which is a typical size for observed voids. The dependence is\nroughly (HR)2 , and hence a void which is about 10 times larger in length scale than the above\nvalue, would have metric functions about 100 times larger.\nWe end this subsection by noting two points. Firstly, we have seen that with our choices\nfor certain arbitrary functions of time in Eqns. (40) and (41), the functions \u00c3 and \u2212\u03c8\u0303 build\nup a relative difference of \u223c 40-50% by present epoch (see Figs. (4a) and (6)). However, it can\nbe shown that if one redefines these functions so that they vanish at r = rc rather than at the\norigin (in line with the discussion below Eqn. (41)), then the relative difference between the\nfunctions reduces to \u223c 5% at present epoch in Regions 2 and 3. This is demonstrated in Fig.\n7 for two representative values of the coordinate r. In Region 1 the the relative difference is\nmaximum at the center r = 0, being about 30% at present epoch (which is obvious since with\nthe redefined functions, the relative difference at the center is simply the relative difference of\nthe original functions at r = rc ). The origin of the large relative difference seen in, e.g. Fig.\n4a is therefore not completely clear, and may even be unphysical. This issue deserves more\ncareful consideration, and we hope to return to it in future work (see also Section 4 below). In\nany case, we emphasize that our main result is that the magnitude of the functions \u00c3 and \u03c8\u0303\nthemselves, is very small. This brings us to the second issue.\nIt is known that simply having a metric of the form (29) with only the magnitude of the\nperturbations being small, is not enough to guarantee consistency with Einstein's equations\nwritten as a perturbation series; additional constraints on the derivatives of these functions\nmust be satisfied. These constraints, given in e.g. Ref. [8], take the form (for the metric (29)\n\n15\n\n\f0.45\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\noriginal\n\n0.35\n\nredefined\n\nredefined\n0.3\n|A/\u03c8|-1\n\n0.3\n|A/\u03c8|-1\n\noriginal\n\n0.4\n\n0.25\n0.2\n0.15\n\n0.2\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0.05\n0\n\n-0.1\n0\n\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9\n\n1\n(t/t0)\n\n0\n\n(a) r = (1/2)(r\u2217 + rc )\n\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9\n\n1\n(t/t0)\n\n(b) r = (1/2)(rc + rv )\n\nFigure 7: The relative difference between the metric functions \u00c3 and \u2212\u03c8\u0303, defined as |\u00c3/\u03c8\u0303| \u2212 1, plotted\nas a function of time at r = (1/2)(r\u2217 + rc ) (panel (a)) and at r = (1/2)(rc + rv ) (panel (b)).

On dimensional grounds, treating \u00c3 \u223c (HR)2 \u226a 1, \u2202t \u223c H and \u2207 \u223c aR\u22121 , it is easy to\nsee that these constraints will be satisfied by our solution. This should also be expected since\nwe started from an exact solution of the Einstein equations and performed a self-consistent\ncoordinate transformation.\n\n3.3\n\nThe magnitude of the backreaction\n\nOne can now legitimately ask the question, \"How large is the effect of the small metric inhomogeneities?\" Naively, one would argue that small inhomogeneities must lead to small effects.\nIndeed, the question of the magnitude of the backreaction in the Newtonianly perturbed FLRW\nsetting has been investigated by Behrend, et al. [10] in the linear and quasilinear regimes, and\nthey find that corrections to the FLRW equations remain at the level of one part in 105 . The\neffect of perturbative metric inhomogeneities on observables such as the luminosity distance\nevaluated using the perturbed FLRW metric with a fixed background, has also been studied [11]\nand shown to be small. However, what we are dealing with is a situation in which the matter\nperturbations are completely nonlinear, and it is not a priori clear that the same arguments\nwould carry through. Indeed, we saw in section 2 that the deceleration parameter q deviated\nfrom its EdS value by about \u223c 10%. Here we give an argument based on dimensional considerations supplemented with realistic numbers, which will show that this effect is scale dependent,\nand is not expected to be present if a sufficiently large averaging scale is chosen.\nIn the following we will work at the present epoch t0 . Consider a model situation similar to\nthe one we have been considering so far, such that at present epoch the physical extent of the\noverdense region is R\u2217 , and that of the underdense is Rv . For order of magnitude estimates,\nwe assume that in the perturbed FLRW metric (29) (which is valid for this system provided\nH0 Rv \u226a 1), \u00c3 \u223c \u2212\u03c8\u0303. Also assume that the density contrast in the overdense region is \u03b4\u22170\nand that in the underdense region is \u03b4v0 , where we take \u03b4\u22170 and \u03b4v0 to be constant in space,\nwhich is fine for an order of magnitude estimate. The backreaction in the Buchert approach\ncontains, among other terms, the spatial average of the quantity \u22072 \u00c3 which appears in the\n16\n\n\fspatial curvature [6, 10], where \u22072 is the Laplacian operator for the flat 3-space metric. The\nspatial curvature has the structure\ni\n1 h\nR \u223c 2 (#1 )\u22072 \u00c3 + (#2 )\u00c3\u22072 \u00c3 + (#3 )(\u2207\u00c3)2 ,\n(55)\na\nwhere #1 , #2 , #3 are constants whose values are irrelevant for this order of magnitude argument.\nDue to the Einstein equations in the small scale Newtonian approximation, the leading order\neffect in the nonlinear regime, comes from \u22072 \u00c3 which satisfies\n\u001a 2\nH0 \u03b4\u22170 ,\noverdense region ,\n2\n\u2207 \u00c3 \u223c\n(56)\n2\nH0 \u03b4v0 ,\nunderdense region .\n\nConsider the situation when, at present epoch, R\u2217 \u223c 6Mpc, Rv \u223c 30Mpc, \u03b4\u22170 \u223c 102 and\n\u03b4v0 \u223c \u22120.9. These are typical numbers for clusters of galaxies and voids. It is straightforward\nto now show that the spatial average of \u22072 \u00c3 over a domain comprising the overdense and\nunderdense region, works out to be\n\u0003\nH02 \u0002 3\n3\n,\nR\n\u03b4\n+\nR\n\u03b4\n\u22170\nv0\n\u2217\nv\nR\u22173 + Rv3\n\u2243 \u22120.1H02 .\n\nh\u22072 \u00c3i \u223c\n\n(57)\n\nIt would appear therefore, that this spatial average of \u22072 \u00c3 (which is usually neglected) thus\nturns out to be a significant contributor to the backreaction. (In fact it is the most significant\ncontributor, since the other terms are clearly of at least one higher order in the small quantity\n(H0 Rv )2 , for such a model.)\nAs we now argue, however, the above effect can be deceptive, and is really scale dependent. Let the initial density contrasts in the overdense and underdense regions be \u03b4\u2217i and \u03b4vi\nrespectively, so that \u03b4\u2217i , |\u03b4vi | \u226a 1. If M\u2217i , Mvi , M\u2217 and Mv are the masses at initial time and\ntoday, in the overdense and underdense region respectively, and \u03c1i and \u03c10 are the values of the\nbackground density at initial time and today, then at initial time\nM\u2217i \u2248 \u03c1i (ai R\u2217 )3 = \u03c10 R\u22173 , Mvi \u2248 \u03c10 Rv3 ,\n\n(58)\n\nM\u2217 = \u03c10 (1 + \u03b4\u2217 )R\u22173 > M\u2217i , Mv = \u03c10 (1 + \u03b4v )Rv3 < Mvi .\n\n(59)\n\nand at present time,\n\nWe now make the crucial observation that if the averaging scale is large enough, and we are\ncounting several such \"pairs\" of overdense and underdense regions, then the mass ejected from\nthe underdense region must have all gone into the overdense region. It is then easy to show,\nthat\n\u03b4\u2217 R\u22173 \u2248 \u2212\u03b4v Rv3 ,\n(60)\nwhich means that, just like in the linear theory, the average of \u22072 \u00c3 is expected to be negligible\non such a scale. In the real universe, we do expect that the averaging scale must be at least\nof the order of the homogeneity scale, and on such a scale we will be sampling several pairs\nof overdense and underdense regions. The only cumulative effects that may arise with such\na choice of scale are from terms such as (\u2207\u00c3)2 , which as we mentioned earlier, are of one\nhigher order in the perturbation and will give effects of the size \u223c H02 (H0 Rv )2 \u226a H02 . (For a\ndemonstration of the scale dependence of the effect, see e.g. the work of Li and Schwarz [14].)\nIn the light of this discussion, our results of section 2 (figures (2a)-(2c)) can be understood\nas arising due to the fact that we are not averaging on a scale large enough to sample many\noverdense and underdense pairs. In the language of the above argument, all the mass ejected\n17\n\n\ffrom the underdense region (in coordinates which are comoving with the background), is not\ngoing into the overdense region which is part of the averaging domain. Some of the matter is\nescaping outside the averaging domain and is left unaccounted for. This explains an imbalance\nas suggested by Eqn. (57).\n\n4\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this paper we have addressed the question of whether or not the assumptions involved in using\na perturbed FLRW framework to describe the metric of the present Universe, break down during\nepochs of structure formation, and whether averaging over inhomogeneities in such a context\ncan yield effects large enough to lead to an accelerating scale factor. We have demonstrated\ntwo things. First, it is very essential to impose initial conditions properly matched across any\nboundaries present in the model. Neglecting to do so (for example by ignoring certain regions\nsuch as Region 2 of our model) can lead to effects such as an accelerating effective scale factor\namod . Also, as we saw in Fig. 2d, it is in principle possible to have very large deviations from\nFLRW-like conditions after averaging, but this is at the cost of initial conditions which are\nunrealistic when confronted with the CMB data.\nSecondly, we have shown that, provided peculiar velocities of matter are small (which is a\nreasonable assumption on observational grounds), one can explicitly find coordinates in which\nthe metric of the Universe is of the perturbed FLRW form (29). This by itself is not a surprising\nresult, since one can always do this locally (our Region 1 for example is a closed FLRW subUniverse by itself, without any coordinate transformations). What is important is the fact that\nthe background FLRW used for comparison is taken to be uniquely and globally defined, so that\nevery local region involved in structure formation can be compared to this background in an\nunambiguous fashion. The existence of this global FLRW model is not simply an assumption\nmade at the present epoch, it is justified by the fact that density fluctuations in the past were\nvery small.\nAn issue worth highlighting again is that the time coordinates involved in the transformation\nfrom the synchronous coordinates to the perturbed FLRW form, are linked by an infinitesimal\ntransformation (after controlling some degrees of freedom by setting arbitrary functions of time\nto zero), as expected with weak gravitational fields. While our model is perhaps not the most\nrealistic depiction of observed voids, we expect this feature to hold in more realistic models also.\nAt first glance this may appear to differ from Wiltshire's claim [4] that the clocks of observers\nin bound regions face a significant calibration when compared with those inside large voids.\nHowever the issue is rather subtle, since Wiltshire's arguments involve a different choice of time\nslicing than the standard constant t hypersurfaces used here, and his model shows cumulative\neffects over large times. It is possible that these cumulative effects are related to the relative\ndifference between the metric functions which we discussed in Section 3, but a straightforward\ncomparison is not possible at this stage. In this context, it becomes essential to understand\nthe origins of those differences, and moreover the fact that the magnitude of the difference is\nsensitive to boundary conditions.\nA few remarks concerning further tests of the backreaction argument, with more realistic\nmodels of structure formation which should account for pressure. We have not modelled voids\nsurrounded by overdensities, since such models are plagued by shell-crossings in the absence\nof pressure. (Our current model also faces this difficulty beyond region 3.) But qualitatively,\nwe expect our results to hold even in models where a suitable pressure term takes care of shell\ncrossings and leads to stable structures surrounding expanding voids, since we expect peculiar\nvelocities to remain small in this situation as well. As long as the sizes of individual voids\nare not an appreciable fraction of the Hubble scale, one expects that here as well, it will be\npossible to find coordinate transformations like the one we have presented. We will return to\n18\n\n\fthis problem in future work.\nFinally, we comment on an issue which deserves careful consideration. Recall that in the\nBuchert scheme of averaging perturbative inhomogeneities, which has been employed by several\nauthors [3, 10, 13], there are two scale factors \u2013 the background scale factor a(t) which satisfies\nthe usual FLRW equations, and the effective scale factor aD (t) which satisfies the Buchert\nequations [6]. It is our belief that this situation has an inherent ambiguity \u2013 which of the two\nscale factors is relevant for observations? In our opinion, a more consistent way of proceeding\nwould be to employ the fully covariant averaging scheme due to Zalaletdinov [7], developed\nfurther in the cosmological context by [21]. In this scheme, there would be only one scale\nfactor, unambiguously associated with a background metric, which would satisfy the corrected\nEinstein equations. The fact that backreaction is negligible in the linear regime should allow\nthe problem to be well-posed at say the last scattering epoch. While we have estimated the\neffects of averaging inhomogeneities to be negligible on large enough scales in Buchert's scheme,\nthis was done in a perturbation theory around the fixed Einstein-deSitter background. It is not\nclear that this result will continue to hold even at late times when the background itself is\n\"evolving\", namely, being corrected by the (small but cumulative) effects of inhomogeneities.\nNote that if these effects build up at late times, then in this scheme with only one scale factor,\nthe evolution of the perturbations will also be modified, which may lead to some interesting\neffects. We will investigate these issues in the near future.\nIn conclusion, we wish to suggest that it has not yet been conclusively established that\ncosmological backreaction becomes large enough during the structure formation phase to cause\nan acceleration of the scale factor. On the contrary, the calculation presented in the present\npaper suggests that the backreaction remains small during this phase, and that the intuitive\npicture concerning weak gravitational fields is actually realized in the form of a perturbed FLRW\nmetric. Self-consistently accounting for the effects that the backreaction would implicitly have\non the evolution of the perturbations (via the scale factor), may lead to interesting effects which\nremain to be explored.\nAcknowledgments : It is a pleasure to thank Karel van Acoleyen and T.
