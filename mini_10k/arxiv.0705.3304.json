They\nappear in the study of black holes and in recent years they have been widely studied [1]. Interestingly\nQNM's have also been found in nonrelativistic systems [2]. However as in the case of bound states\nor normal modes (NM) there are not many exactly solvable potentials admitting QNM solutions and\noften QNM frequencies have to be determined numerically or other approximating techniques such as the\nWKB method, phase integral method etc. Consequently it is of interest to obtain new exactly solvable\npotentials admitting such solutions.\nIn the case of NM's or scattering problems a number of methods based on intertwining technique\ne.g, Darboux algorithm [3], supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSYQM) [4] etc. have been used\nsuccessfully to construct new solvable potentials. Usually the intertwining operators are constructed using\nfirst order differential operators. However in recent years intertwining operators have been generalised\nto higher orders [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] and this has opened up new possibilities to construct a whole new class of\npotentials having nonlinear symmetry. In particular use of higher order intertwining operator or higher\norder Darboux algorithm leads to nonlinear supersymmetry.\nQNM's are associated with outgoing wave like behaviour at spatial infinity and unlike normal modes\n(NM's), the QNM wave functions have rather unusual characteristic (for example, wave functions diverging at both or one infinity) [10]. Such open systems have been studied using (first order) intertwining\ntechnique [11]. Recently it has also been shown that open systems can be described within the framework\nof first order SUSY [10]. Here our objective is to examine whether or not intertwining method based on\nhigher order differential operators can be applied to open systems. For the sake of simplicity we shall\nconfine ourselves to second order intertwining operators (second order Darboux formalism) and it will\nbe shown that the second order Darboux algorithm can indeed be applied to models admitting QNM's\nalthough not exactly in the same way as in the case of NM's. In particular we shall use the second order\nintertwining operator to the P\u00f6schl-Teller potential to construct several new potentials admitting QNM\nsolutions. It will also be shown that such potentials may be related to the P\u00f6schl-Teller potential by\nsecond order SUSY. The organisation of the paper is as follows: in section 2, we present construction of\nnew potentials using second order intertwining operators; in section 3, nonlinear SUSY underlying the\npotentials is shown and finally section 4 is devoted to a conclusion.\n\n2\n\nSecond order intertwining approach to quasinormal modes\n\nTwo Hamiltonians H0 and H1 is said to be intertwined by an operator L if\nLH0 = H1 L\n\n(1)\n\nClearly if \u03c8 is an eigenfunction H0 with eigenvalue E then L\u03c8 is an eigenfunction of H1 with the same\neigenvalue provided L\u03c8 satisfies required boundary conditions. If L is constructed using first order\ndifferential operators then intertwining method is equivalent to Darboux formalism or SUSYQM. In\nd\n+ W (x), then the isospectral potential is V1 =\nparticular if V0 is the starting potential and L =\ndx\ndW\n[4]. Similarly if L is generalised to higher orders then it is equivalent to higher order Darboux\nV0 + 2\ndx\nalgorithm or higher order SUSY.\n\n2\n\n\fLet us now consider L to be a second order differential operator of the form [7]\nd2\nd\n+ \u03b2(x)\n+ \u03b3(\u03b2)\ndx2\ndx\n\nL\n\n=\n\n\u03b2(x)\n\n= \u2212\n\n\u03b3(\u03b2)\n\n\u03b2 \u2032\u2032\n+\n= \u2212\n2\u03b2\n\nd\nlog Wi,j (x)\ndx\n\u0012\n\n\u03b2\u2032\n2\u03b2\n\n\u00132\n\n(2)\n\n\u03b2\u2032\n\u03b22\n+\n+\n\u2212\n2\n4\n\n\u03c9i2 \u2212 \u03c9j2\n2\u03b2\n\n!2\n\nwhere \u03c8i and \u03c8j are eigenfunctions of H0 corresponding to the eigenvalues \u03c9i2 and \u03c9j2 and Wi,j =\n(\u03c8i \u03c8j\u2032 \u2212 \u03c8i\u2032 \u03c8j ) is the corresponding Wronskian. Then the isospectral partner potential V2 (x) obtained via\nsecond order Darboux formalsim is given by\nV2 (x) = V0 (x) \u2212 2\n\nd2\nlog Wi,j (x)\ndx2\n\n(3)\n\nThe wave functions \u03c8i (x) and \u03c6i (x) corresponding to V0 (x) and V2 (x) are connected by\n\u03c6k (x) = L\u03c8k (x) =\n\n1\nWi,j (x)\n\n\u03c8i\n\u03c8i\u2032\n\u03c8i\u2032\u2032\n\n\u03c8j\n\u03c8j\u2032\n\u03c8j\u2032\u2032\n\n\u03c8k\n\u03c8k\u2032\n\u03c8k\u2032\u2032\n\n, i, j 6= k\n\n(4)\n\nThe eigenfunctions obtained from \u03c8i and \u03c8j are given by\nf (x) \u221d\n\n\u03c8j (x)\n\u03c8i (x)\n, g(x) \u221d\nWi,j (x)\nWi,j (x)\n\n(5)\n\nIt may be noted that in the case of normal modes, the new potential would be free of any new singularities\nif the Wronskian Wi,j (x) is nodeless. This in turn requires that the Wronskian be constructed with the\nhelp of consecutive eigenfunctions (i.e, j = i + 1). Also, the eigenfunctions f (x), g(x) in (5) are not\nacceptable because they do not satisfy the boundary conditions for the normal modes and in any case\nthey are not SUSY partners of the corresponding states in the original potential. Thus in the case of\nnormal modes the spectrum of the new potential is exactly the same as the starting potential except for\nthe levels used in the construction of the Wronskian. However we shall find later that not all of these\nresults always hold in the case of QNM's.\nLet us now consider one dimensional Klein-Gordon equation of the form [10]\n[\u2202t2 \u2212 \u2202x2 + V (x)]\u03c8(x, t) = 0\n\n(6)\n\nThe corresponding eigenvalue equation reads\nH\u03c8n = \u03c9n2 \u03c8n (x),\n\nH =\u2212\n\nd2\n+ V (x)\ndx2\n\n(7)\n\nThe QNM solutions of the equation (7) are characterised by the fact that they are either (1) increasing\nat both ends (II) (2) increasing at one end and decreasing at the other (ID,DI). The wave functions\ndecreasing at both ends (DD) correspond to bound states or NM's. In the case of QNM's the eigenvalues\n(\u03c9n2 ) may be complex or real and negative. If Re(\u03c9n ) 6= 0 then the SUSY formalsim can not be applied\n3\n\n\fsince in that case the superpotential W (x) becomes complex and consequently one of the partner potential\nbecomes complex. So we shall confine ourselves to the case when Re(\u03c9n ) = 0 i.e, \u03c9n2 are real and negative.\nWe would also like to mention that in case Eq.(7) is to be interpreted as a Schr\u00f6dinger equation one just\nhas to consider the replacement \u03c9n2 \u2192 En .\nThere are a number of potentials which exhibit QNM's. A potential in this category is the inverted\nP\u00f6schl-Teller potential. This potential is used as a good approximation in the study of Schwarzschild\nblack hole and it is given by\nV0 (x) = \u03bdsech2 x\n(8)\nEq.(7) for the potential (8) can be solved in different ways. One of the simplest way is to apply the shape\ninvariance criteria [4] and the solutions are found to be [12, 13, 14]\nr\n1\n1\n1\n\u03c9n\u00b1 = \u2212i(n \u2212 A\u00b1 ), A\u00b1 = \u2212 \u00b1\n\u2212\u03bd =\u2212 \u00b1q\n(9)\n2\n4\n2\n1\n1\n1 + tanhx\n+ q \u2212 i\u03c9n\u00b1 , \u2212 q \u2212 i\u03c9n\u00b1 , 1 \u2212 i\u03c9n\u00b1 ,\n)\n(10)\n2\n2\n2\nWe note that the behaviour of the wave functions (10) i.e, whether they represent a NM or QNM depends\non the value of the parameter \u03bd. For \u03bd \u2208 (0, 1/4) i.e, A+ \u2208 (\u22121/2, 0), A\u2212 \u2208 (\u22121, \u22121/2), the wave functions\nrepresent outgoing waves and are of the type (II). For \u03bd < 0 (i.e, A+ > 0, A\u2212 < 0) then the wave functions\nrepresent NM's when n < A+ while for n > A+ they are QNM's. On the other hand the wave functions\nare always QNM's corresponding to \u03c9n\u2212 . It may be noted that for the QNM's the wave functions (10)\nfor even n are nodeless while those for odd n have exactly one node at the orign. This behaviour of the\nwave functions is quite different from those occuring in the case of NM's. Using the procedure mentioned\nabove we shall now construct new exactly solvable potentials admitting QNM solutions.\n\u03c8n\u00b1 (x) = (sechx)(A\n\n2.1\n\n\u00b1\n\n\u2212n)\n\n2 F1 (\n\nConstruction of isospectral partner potential using NM's\n\nCase 1. V0 with two NM's: In order to apply the second order intertwining approach one may start\nwith a potential V0 (x) admitting (1) at least two NM's and the rest QNM's or (2) only QNM's. We begin\nwith the first possibility. Thus we consider \u03bd = \u22125.04 so that there are two NM's. In this case we obtain\nfrom (9) A\u00b1 = 1.8, \u22122.8. Thus the NM's correspond to \u03c90+ = 1.8i, \u03c91+ = 0.8i and are given by\n\u03c80+ (x) = (sech x)A\n\n+\n\n, \u03c81+ (x) = (sech x)(A\n\n+\n\n\u22121)\n\n+\n+\n2 F1 (2A , \u22121, A ,\n\n1 + tanhx\n)\n2\n\n(11)\n\nThe QNM's in this case correspond to the frequencies \u03c9n+ , n = 2, 3, ... and are given by \u03c8n+ (x). Also\nfor \u03c9n\u2212 , n = 0, 1, 2, ... there is another set of QNM's and the corresponding wave functions are given by\n\u03c8n\u2212 (x). In this case A\u2212 < 0 and consequently there is no NM.\nLet us construct a potential isospectral to (8) using the NM frequencies \u03c90+ and \u03c91+ . Then from (10)\n+\nthe Wronskian W0,1\nis found to be\n+\nW0,1\n= \u2212(sechx)2A\n\n+\n\n\u22121\n\n(12)\n\n+\nClearly W0,1\ndoes not have a zero. In this case the new potential V2+ (x) is free of singularities and is\ngiven by\nd2\n+\n(x) = \u2212(1 \u2212 A+ )(2 \u2212 A+ )sech2 x\n(13)\nV2+ (x) = V0 (x) \u2212 2 2 log W0,1\ndx\n\n4\n\n\fUsing the value of A+ it is easy to see that the new potential V2+ (x) in (13) does not support any bound\nstate but only QNM's. This is also reflected by the explicit expressions for the wave functions. Using (5)\nwe find\n+\n+\nf + (x) = (sechx)(1\u2212A ) , g + (x) = \u2212(sechx)\u2212A tanhx\n(14)\nFrom (14) it follows that the above wave functions are QNM's corresponding to \u2212\u03c91+ and \u2212\u03c90+ respectively. Note that these two QNM's are new and were not present in the original potential. This in fact\nis where the behaviour of the new potential is different from the usual case. In the case of potentials\nsupporting only NM's the wave functions f + (x), g + (x) obtained through (5) do not have acceptable behaviour. However in the present case both these wave functions become QNM's instead of NM's and\nthey have acceptable behaviour at \u00b1\u221e as can be seen from (14) as well as from figure 1. The other wave\n+\n+\nfunctions \u03c6+\nn (x), n = 2, 3, ... corresponding to QNM frequencies \u03c9n = \u2212i(n \u2212 A ) can be obtained using\n(4) and are given by\n\u0002\n(A+ \u2212n)\n\u03c6+\n(n \u2212 1)n Fn tanh2 x\nn (x) = (sechx)\n+c1 (2n \u2212 3) Fn+1 sech2 x tanhx\n\n(15)\n\n\u0003\n+ c1 c2 Fn+2 sech4 x , n = 2, 3, ...\n\nwhere\nc1\n\n= \u2212\n\nFn\n\n=\n\n(\u2212n + 1)(2A+ \u2212 n + 2)\nn(2A+ \u2212 n + 1)\n,\nc\n=\n2\n2(A+ \u2212 n + 1)\n2(A+ \u2212 n + 2)\n\n+\n2 F1 (\u2212n, 2A\n\n\u2212 n + 1, A+ \u2212 n + 1, 1+tanhx\n)\n2\n+\n\n+\n\n(16)\n\n1+tanhx\n)\n2\n\nFn+1\n\n=\n\n2 F1 (\u2212n\n\n+ 1, 2A \u2212 n + 2, A \u2212 n + 2,\n\nFn+2\n\n=\n\n2 F1 (\u2212n\n\n)\n+ 2, 2A+ \u2212 n + 3, A+ \u2212 n + 3, 1+tanhx\n2\n\n+\nTo see the nature of the wave functions (15) we have plotted \u03c6+\n2 (x) and \u03c63 (x) in figure 1. From the\nfigure it can be seen that these wave functions are indeed QNM's and for even n they do not have nodes\nwhile for odd n they have one node at the origin. We would like to point out that the new potential\nV2+ (x) has two more QNM's than V0 (x). Thus except for two additional QNM's, the QNM frequencies\n\u03c9n+ is common to both V0 (x) and V2+ (x). We now examine the second set of solutions corresponding to\n\u03c9n\u2212 . It can be shown by direct calculation that the new potential (13) also possess this set of solutions.\n\nCase 2. V0 (x) with three NM's: Let us now consider the potential (8) supporting three NM's. A\nconvenient choice of the parameter is \u03bd = \u22126.2 so that A+ = 2.04, A\u2212 = \u22123.04. We shall now construct\n+\nthe new potential using the NM frequencies \u03c91+ = 1.04i and \u03c92+ = 0.04i. The Wronskian W1,2\nis found\nto be\n+\n(sechx)2A \u22121 +\n+\n[A \u2212 2 \u2212 (A+ \u2212 1)cosh2x]\n(17)\nW1,2\n(x) =\n2(A+ \u2212 1)\nNow using (3) we obtain\nV2+ (x) = \u2212(A+ \u2212 1)(A+ \u2212 2)sech2 x + 8(A+ \u2212 1)\n\n(A+ \u2212 2)cosh2x \u2212 (A+ \u2212 1)\n[(A+ \u2212 1)cosh2x \u2212 (A+ \u2212 2)]2\n\n(18)\n\nTo get an idea of the potential, we have plotted V2+ (x) in figure 2. From figure 2, it is clear that V2+ (x)\nsupports at least one NM. Next to examine the wave functions we first consider f + (x) and g + (x). \u00bfFrom\n5\n\n\fthe relation (5) we obtain\n+\n\n+\n\n(sechx)\u2212(A +1) [1 \u2212 (2A+ \u2212 1)tanh2 x]\n2(A+ \u2212 1)(sechx)\u2212A tanhx\n+\n,\ng\n(x)\n=\nf (x) =\n(A+ \u2212 1)cosh2x \u2212 (A+ \u2212 2)\n(A+ \u2212 1)cosh2x \u2212 (A+ \u2212 2)\n+\n\n(19)\n\nAlso from (4) it follows that\n+\n\n\u03c6+\n0 (x) =\n\n4(A+ \u2212 1)(sechx)(A \u22122)\n(A+ \u2212 1)cosh2x + A+ \u2212 2\n\n(20)\n\n\u00bfFrom (19) it follows that f + (x) and g + (x) are new QNM's corresponding to frequencies \u2212\u03c92+ = \u22120.04i\nand \u2212\u03c91+ = \u22121.04i respectively. The former has one node the later has two nodes. The nodal structure\nof the QNM wave functions are different from those obtained earlier. The reason for this is that since we\n+\nstarted with the first and second excited state NM's and the Wronskian W1,2\nis nodeless, the behaviour\n+\n+\n+\nof the original wave functions \u03c81,2 (x) are retained by f (x) and g (x). However, \u03c6+\n0 (x) is a NM at\n\u03c90+ = 2.04i and it does not have a node because \u03c80+ (x) does not have one. Also other QNM wave\nfunctions \u03c6+\nn (x), n = 3, 4, ... have either no node or one node. In figure 3 we have plotted the some of\nthe wave functions. We also note that although the potential in (13) is of a similar nature as (8), the\npotential (18) is of a completely different type. In particular it is a non shape invariant potential. Finally\nwe discuss the possibility of a second set of solutions for the potential (18). We recall that the existence\nof two sets of solutions for the potential (8) (or (13)) was due to the fact that the parameter \u03bd could be\nexpressed as a product of two different parameters A\u00b1 . However in the case of (18) the entire potential\ncan not be expressed in terms of two distinct parameters because of the presence of the second term.\nConsequently the potential (18) has only one set of solution mentioned above.\n\n2.2\n\nConstruction of isospectral partner potential using QNM's\n\nCase 1. Potential based on consecutive QNM's: Here we shall construct isospectral partner of a\npotential which has only QNM's. Thus we consider \u03bd = 0.24 and in this case A\u00b1 = \u22120.4, \u22120.6. We\nconsider the A+ sector and begin with the freequencies \u03c90+ and \u03c91+ . In this case the expression for\n+\nthe Wronskian W0,1\n, the new potential V2+ (x) and the QNM wave functions can be derived from the\nexpressions (12), (13) and (15) respectively except that we now have to use a different parameter value.\nThus the new potential is given by\nV2+ (x) = \u22123.36 sech2 x\n(21)\nFor this potential the NM's corresponding to \u2212\u03c90+ = 0.4i and \u2212\u03c91+ = 1.4i are given respectively by\nf + = (sechx)1.4 , g + = (sechx)0.4 tanhx\n\n(22)\n\nClearly these NM's are not SUSY partner of any levels in H0 . The QNM's are correspond to \u03c9n+ =\n\u2212i(n + 0.4), n = 2, 3, ... and are given by (15) with A+ = \u22120.4. We have plotted some of the wave\nfunctions in fig 4. From the figure we find that the wave functions f + (x) and g + (x) correspond to NM's\nand the other wave functions represent QNM's which are the SUSY partners of the QNM's in H0 . We\nnote that as in (13) the potential (21) has two sets of QNM's, the second of which corresponds to \u03c9n\u2212 .\nCase 2. Potential based on non consecutive QNM's: Here we shall consider the previous parameter values (i.e, A+ = \u22120.4) and construct the new potential using the non consecutive levels \u03c90+ and\n\u03c93+ . In this case the Wronskian is given by\n+\n\n+\nW0,3\n\n(sechx)(2A \u22123)\n=\n[(9 \u2212 6A+ )tanh2 x + 3]\n2(A+ \u2212 2)\n6\n\n(23)\n\n\fIt can be shown that the Wronskian (23) is nodeless. Now using the (3) the new potential is found to be\n(A+ \u2212 2)[2(A+ (A+ \u2212 2)(3A+ \u2212 7) \u2212 2A+ (A+ \u2212 1)(A+ \u2212 4) cosh2x \u2212 (3 \u2212 2A+ )2 (A+ \u2212 1) sech2 x]\n[1 \u2212 A+ + (A+ \u2212 2) cosh2x]2\n(24)\nThe potential (24) is free of any singularity and is plotted in fig 5. From figure 5 we find that it supports\nNM's. Also as explained earlier, this potential has also one set of solution. We now consider the wave\nfunctions corresponding to \u03c80+ (x) and \u03c83+ (x). These are obtained from (5) and are given by\nV2+ (x) =\n\n+\n+\n2(A+ \u2212 2)\n(1 \u2212 2A+ )tanh2 x + 3\n(sechx)(3\u2212A ) , g + (x) =\nsinhx (sechx)(1\u2212A )\n+\n2\n+\n2\n(9 \u2212 6A )tanh x + 3\n(9 \u2212 6A )tanh x + 3\n(25)\nThe above wave functions (with zero and one node respectively) represent NM's corresponding to \u2212\u03c93+ =\n3.4i and \u2212\u03c90+ = 0.4i. The other wave functions can be obtained through (4). The two QNM wave\n+\n+\nfunctions lying between \u03c90+ and \u03c93+ are \u03c6+\n1,2 (x) corresponding to \u03c91 = \u22121.4i and \u03c92 = \u22122.4i. We have\n+\n+\nplotted these wave functions in fig 6. From figure 6, it can be seen that f (x) and g (x) are NM's while\n\u03c6+\n1,2 (x) are QNM's, with the later having two nodes. The rest of the QNM wave functions corresponding\nto the freequencies \u03c9n+ = \u2212(n + 0.4)i, n 6= 0, 3 are given by \u03c6+\nn (x) and they have either zero or one node.\n\nf + (x) =\n\n3\n\nPolynomial SUSY\n\nIn first order SUSY, the anticommutator {Q, Q\u2020 } of the supercharges is a linear function of the Hamiltonian. On the other hand in higher order SUSY, {Q, Q\u2020 } is a nonlinear function of the Hamiltonian. It\nwill be shown here that the Hamiltonians H0 and H2 are related by second order SUSY. To this end we\ndefine the supercharges Q and Q\u2020 as follows:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0 0\n0 L\u2020\nQ=\n, Q\u2020 =\n(26)\nL 0\n0 0\nwhere the operator L is given by (2).\nClearly the supercharges Q and Q\u2020 are nilpotent. We now define a super Hamiltonian H of the form\n\u0013\n\u0012\nH0 0\n(27)\nH=\n0 H2\nIt can be easily verified that Q, Q\u2020 and H satisfy the following relations :\n[Q, H] = [Q\u2020 , H] = 0\n\n(28)\n\nThen the anticommutator of the supercharges Q and Q\u2020 is given by a second order polynomial in H :\nHss = {Q, Q\u2020 } =\n\n\u0012\n\nL\u2020 L\n0\n\n+\n\n\u03c9j2 )\n\n0\nLL\u2020\n\n\u0013\n\n=\n\n\u00132\n\u0012\n\u03b4\n\u2212 cI\nH+\n2\n\n(29)\n\nwhere I is the 2 \u00d7 2 unit matrix and\n\u03b4=\n\n\u2212(\u03c9i2\n\n, c=\n\n7\n\n\u03c9i2 \u2212 \u03c9j2\n2\n\n!2\n\n(30)\n\n\fAlso we have\n[Q, Hss ] = [Q\u2020 , Hss ] = 0\n\n(31)\n\nThe relations (29) and (31) constitute second order SUSY algebra.\nAs an example let us consider the potentials (8) and (13). The corresponding Hamiltonians H0 and\nH2 are obtained from (7). In this case \u03b4 = 0.5416 and c = 0.2916 so that from (29) we get\n2\n\nHss = (H + 0.5416) \u2212 0.2916I\n\n(32)\n\nIn a similar fashion one may obtain Hss for the other pair of potentials.\n\n4\n\nConclusion\n\nHere we applied the second order Darboux algorithm to the P\u00f6schl-Teller potential and obtained new\nexactly solvable potentials admitting QNM solutions. We have considered a number of possibilties to\nconstruct the new potentials e.g, starting from NM's or starting from QNM's. It has also been shown\nthat the new potentials are related to the original one by second order SUSY. We feel it would also be\nalso useful to analyse the construction of potentials using various levels as well as for different values of\nthe parameter \u03bd (for example, \u03bd = half-integer) [10]. Finally we belive it would be interesting to extend\nthe present approach to other effective potentials appearing in the study of Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m, Kerr\nblack hole etc.\n\nReferences\n[1] K.D.
