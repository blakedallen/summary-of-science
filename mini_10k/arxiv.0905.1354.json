Yet, radio emission persists, and has been argued to be\ndominated by electron-cyclotron maser emission instead of the gyrosynchrotron emission\nfrom warmer stars. These properties may signal a transition in the stellar extended\natmosphere. Stars warmer than about M5 have a solar-like corona and wind-sustained\nheliosphere in which the atmospheric activity is powered by convective motions that\nmove the magnetic field. Stars cooler than early-L, in contrast, may have a jovianlike rotation-dominated magnetosphere powered by the star's rotation in a scaled-up\nanalog of the magnetospheres of Jupiter and Saturn. A dimensional scaling relationship\nfor rotation-dominated magnetospheres by Fan et al. (1982) is consistent with this\nhypothesis.\nSubject headings: stars: magnetic fields - stars: low-mass, brown dwarfs - stars:\nlate-type - planets and satellites: general\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nMain sequence stars have a convective envelope around a radiative core from about spectral\ntype A2 (with an effective temperature of Tef f \u2248 9000 K) to about M3 (Tef f \u2248 3200 K). Stars\nwarmer than about F2 (Tef f \u2248 7000 K) have but a shallow convective envelope that sustains at\nmost weak magnetic activity. As one of these stars, the Sun exhibits many of the properties of\nthe magnetically-driven variability of the population of F2-M3 dwarf stars. The radiative losses\nfrom their chromospheres, transition regions and coronae generally decrease with age as stars lose\nangular momentum through a magnetized wind. The radiative losses from these distinct thermal\ndomains scale through power laws with the average magnetic flux density on the stellar surface.\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nAll of these stars exhibit signatures of flaring that increase with increasing quiescent activity. The\nradio emission from all of these stars, albeit generally weak, scales lineary with the coronal Xray emission, suggestive of persistent non-thermal energetic-particle populations within their outer\natmospheres (e.g., Schrijver and Zwaan, 2000, and references therein; see Berger et al., 2008a, for\na recent version of the radio/X-ray scaling).\nStars cooler than about M2 to M4 are expected to be fully convective (Chabrier and Baraffe,\n2000), lacking the convective overshoot layer and tachocline that are thought to be important\nto the solar dynamo. Yet these stars are capable of generating magnetic field, with a rotationactivity relationship that continues clearly to at least spectral type M8 (e.g., Mohanty et al.,\n2002, Reiners and Basri, 2009). However, their magnetic field appears to be a predominantly\naxi-symmetrical large-scale poloidal field with at most a slow evolution in the surface pattern\n(Donati et al., 2008; also Reiners and Basri, 2009), in contrast to warmer stars that show relativelyrapidly evolving, non-axisymmetric fields evolving subject to flux emergence and differential rotation.\nSpectra of FeH lines reveal that stars at least down to M9 have magnetic fields, and that\nthe coolest stars beyond M6 for which fields can be measured have magnetic flux densities of\nf B = 1.5 kG or more (e.g., Berger et al., 2008b, Hallinan et al., 2006 and 2007, Reiners and Basri,\n2007. X-ray flaring has been reported down to at least M9.5 (e.g., Liebert et al., 1999, Reid et al.,\n1999, Fleming et al., 2003, Berger et al., 2008a).\nBeyond about M8, the relationship between chromospheric (H\u03b1) or coronal (X-ray) emission\nand rotation rate becomes a weak tendency and even that disappears beyond L0 (e.g., Reiners and Basri,\n2009, Basri, 2009; see Mohanty and Basri, 2003, for a discussion of difficulties in assigning spectral types). Whereas essentially all stars of spectral type M8 have strong H\u03b1 emission, this drops\nto 60% at L0, \u2248 15% at L4, and to less than than \u2248 10% by L5 (e.g., Mohanty et al., 2002,\nMohanty and Basri, 2003, West et al., 2004, Reiners, 2007, Reiners and Basri, 2007, Schmidt et al.,\n2007).\nIn contrast to the weakening of the rotation-activity relationship for the traditional chromospheric (H\u03b1) and coronal (X-ray) indicators of magnetic activity beyond about M8, the radio\nluminosity continues to increase with increasing angular velocity up to at least L0 (Berger et al.,\n2008a), with (often variable) radio emission detected to at least L3.5 (Berger, 2006). Interestingly,\nthe essentially linear relationship between radio and X-ray luminosities for all other cool stars\nbreaks down beyond M5, with the X-ray luminosity dropping by a factor of about 3,000 below that\nrelationship at a given radio luminosity by spectral type L0 (Berger et al., 2008a).\nThe reduction of the traditional diagnostics for chromospheric and coronal activity, the weakening of their dependence on rotation rate despite the presence of strong magnetic fields, and the\nincrease in time scale for rotational braking (discussed in Sect. 4), may have their origin in the\nvery low degree of ionization of the photospheric plasma. Mohanty et al. (2002) argue that beyond\nM5, the photospheric plasma is weakly coupled to the magnetic field, and the high resistivity and\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nassociated diffusivity of the plasma should render it very difficult to generate electrical currents by\nconvection-driven field motions or to transmit any generated in the stellar interior to the corona (see\nalso Mohanty and Basri, 2003, who also discuss the role of dust in these cool atmospheres). The\npersistence of radio emission into the L-type range, despite these changes in activity characteristic\nof all other cool stars, suggests we explore a fundamental change in the character of stellar magnetic\nactivity: the weakening of a well-developed convection-powered stellar corona and associated stellar\nwind may cause the stellar outer atmosphere to change from a solar-like corona with heliosphere\nto a Jupiter-like magnetosphere shaped by the incoming wind of the interstellar medium (ISM)\nimpinging on the stellar magnetic field, while powered by the stellar rotation.\n\n2.\n\nRadiative and rotational energy losses\n\nCoronal emission and magnetic braking both weaken rapidly beyond mid-M. Up to about spectral type L0, the energy lost by rotational braking appears to be consistent with that expected from\na solar-like coronal domain beneath an outflowing wind, as can be seen from the following argument. I start from the premise that the stellar atmosphere is essentially hydrostatically stratified.\nNear the stellar surface, an isothermal plasma has a pressure scale height\nHp =\n\nakT mp R\u22172\n,\nGM\u2217\n\n(1)\n\nwith stellar radius R\u2217 , temperature T , proton mass mp , and gravitational constant G. Here, I\nassume a pure hydrogen gas for an order-of-magnitude estimate. The constant a = 1 for a neutral\ngas, and a = 2 for fully-ionized hydrogen. A largely-neutral photospheric gas of T = 2000 K on a\ncompact ultra-cool star with surface gravity g \u223c 105.4 \u223c 9g\u2299 cm/s2 would have Hp (2000 K) \u223c 9 km.\nIn order to lead to magnetic braking, plasma of sufficient density needs to exist out to the\nlesser of the Alfv\u00e9n radius (to which corotation of star and high-atmospheric plasma is enforced)\nand the radius of synchronous rotation (beyond which centrifugal forces dominate). The latter\n(which is likely the smaller of the two for rapidly-rotating L-type dwarf stars) is\nRS =\n\n\u0012\n\nGM\u2217\n\u03a92\n\n\u00131\n\n3\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nfor stellar mass M\u2217 and angular velocity \u03a9 = 2\u03c0/P , at rotation period P . The characteristic value\nof RS \u223c 7R\u2217 (see Table 1) is so much larger than Hp (2000 K) that the plasma density at RS would\nbe insufficient to lead to significant angular momentum loss.\nFor a plasma at coronal temperatures the density scale height is much higher, of course. Only\nvery few stars beyond M9 have been detected in X-rays (e.g., Audard et al., 2007, Robrade and Schmitt,\n2008). Their quiescent emissions are at a level of about LX /Lbol \u223c 10\u22124 , or log(LX ) \u223c 25.5, while\nothers have even lower upper limits.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nAssuming a hydrostatically stratified atmosphere, the electron density ne associated with such\nan emission can be estimated from the X-ray luminosity LX based on the plasma's volumetric\nemission, n2e \u039b(TC ), and characteristic volume, 4\u03c0R\u22172 Hp (TC ),\nLX = 4\u03c0R\u22172 Hp (TC ) n2e \u039b(TC )\n\n(3)\n\nfor a plasma at temperature TC , with an emissivity \u039b(TC ) \u2248 2 \u00d7 10\u221218 T \u22122/3 (for log(TC ) \u2208\n[5.5, 7.5]); for TC = 1.5 MK, comparable to that of the bulk of the solar wind and consistent with\nthe very-limited X-ray spectral information available on L-type dwarf stars (Robrade and Schmitt,\n2008), \u039b(1.5 MK) \u223c 10\u221221.8 (e.g., Schrijver and Zwaan, 2000). The coronal-base density thus\nestimated for L-type stars with log(LX ) \u223c 25.5 and TC = 1.5 MK is n0 \u223c 108.8 cm\u22123 .\nTo estimate the plasma density at height RS within the equatorial plane, the density for an\nisothermal atmosphere can be approximated from a balance between pressure gradient, gravity,\nand centrifugal acceleration:\n\u0012\n\u0012 2 \u0013\n\u0013\nGM\u2217 mp n(r)\n\u03a9 mp\ndn(r)\n=\u2212\n+\nn(r) r\n(4)\n2\ndr\n2kTC\nr\n2kTC\n(note that the stratification of a subsonic wind is very similar to a static stratified atmosphere, e.g.,\nHansteen, 2009). With the above value of n0 , n(RS ) \u2248 105.6\u22125.8 cm\u22123 for the characteristic L2 and\nL5 stars in Table 1 (the centrifugal force below RS modifies the density profile by a factor of . 2\nrelative to the stratification in the absence of rotation).\nNow assume that the centrifugal force beyond RS accelerates plasma outward, which is replenished from below at (at most) the thermal velocity\nvth =\n\n\u0012\n\nkTC\n\u03b3\nmp\n\n\u00131\n\n2\n\n,\n\n(5)\n\nfor adiabatic index \u03b3, so that the upper limit for the mass loss is\n\u1e40 = \u03b1 4\u03c0R\u22172 vth mp n(RS ),\n\n(6)\n\nwith \u03b1 a geometry factor. If the mass loss were isotropic, \u03b1 \u2261 1, but as mass is probably lost from\nonly part of the surface area, I use \u03b1 = 1/2 below.\nThe stellar magnetic field can enforce corotation out to a distance RA where the plasma \u03b2\nbecomes of order unity, given by\nB02\n4\u03c0\n\n\u0012\n\nR\u2217\nRA\n\n\u00136\n\n= 2n(RA )kTC ,\n\n(7)\n\nif the field is approximated by a dipole of characteristic strength B0 at the stellar surface; n(r) is\nassumed to be given by Eq. (4).\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nOutflowing plasma in a spherical shell carries an angular momentum\n2\n2\nL\u0307 = \u03a9RA\n\u1e40 ,\n3\n\n(8)\n\nWC = L\u0307\u03a9.\n\n(9)\n\nand a rotational energy of\n1025.8\n\nWith the values in Table 1, one finds WC \u2248\nerg/s for log(LX ) \u223c 25.5. For the characteristic\nL2 star in Table 1, this compares well to the estimated loss Wrot from rotation-age studies (see\nSect. 4), so that we can conclude that the existence of a faint thermal corona in early L-type stars\nis compatible with the inferred magnetic braking.\nThe estimatd WC is while about an order of magnitude larger than Wrot for the M7 dwarf\nstar. This may be because of the exponential dependence WC on TC , or because the corona of the\nM7 star may be solar-like, in the sense that a few relatively bright and dense regions dominate the\nemission, so that the base density from Eq. (3) would be an overestimate for the highest coronal\nloops.\nThe estimates in this section obviously depend on the assumed values of LX and TC . The value\nof WC scales with LX about as a square root, so that our conclusions are not strongly modified\nif the characteristic value of LX observed for the L-dwarf binary Kelu-1 is somewhat larger than\nwhat is characteristic of the ensemble of similar L-type dwarf stars. The dependence on TC is much\nstronger, not surprisingly, because of the near-exponential stratification of density in units of the\npressure scale height: for TC = 1 \u2212 3 MK, log(Wrot ) = 24.2 \u2212 27.3.\n\n3.\n\nThe magnetosphere of the coolest dwarf stars\n\nEven though magnetic braking remains compatible with the concept of a hot corona, the radio\nemission in ultracool dwarfs is disproportionally strong. One possible cause for this that should be\nexplored, and can then be ruled out, is the interaction with the ISM. Observations suggest that\nthere is relatively little heated coronal plasma well into the L-type spectral range, there should\nnot be much of an associated stellar wind either. The motion of a star with at most a weak wind\nrelative to the ISM should lead to the formation of a magnetopause. The energy input into the\nstellar magnetosphere from this interaction is expected to be low, based on the following.\nThe standoff (or Chapman-Ferraro) distance of the magnetopause is set by where the dynamic\n2 of the ISM wind with density \u03c1 and relative velocity v equals the magnetic pressure\npressure \u03c1w vw\nw\nw\nof the stellar field. Observations suggest that the large-scale field of very cool dwarf stars can be\napproximated by a dipole field, so that the field scales with \u03bc/r 3 , with the magnetic moment\n\u03bc = B\u2217 R\u22173 , where B\u2217 is the field strength near the stellar equator. RCF for a late M-type or L-type\n2 \u221d B 2 (R\ndwarf star can thus be estimated from \u03c1w vw\nCF )/8\u03c0, or:\n2\nBG\nRCF\n1/6\n.\n\u223c 3.5(\n2 )\nR\u2217\nn0 v100\n\n(10)\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nThe constant of proportionality is determined by using the observation that for Earth RCF,\u2295 \u2248\n10 Earth radii (Russell, 2007), for a wind speed of v100 \u223c 4 (in units of 100 km/s) and a characteristic\nsolar-wind particle density n0 = 10 cm\u22123 (Feldman et al., 1977), and BG \u223c 0.6 G for the Earth's\npolar field strength (Allen, 1972).\nThe relative motion of stars through the ISM averages about 40 km/s for a sample of very cool\ndwarf stars (e.g., Wood et al., 2005, Schmidt et al., 2007). For a hypothetical dwarf star that has\nno stellar wind, that moves through an ISM like that around the solar system with n0 = 0.1 (e.g.,\nWood et al., 2002) at v100 = 0.4, and BG = 1.5 kG, one finds RCF,\u2217 /R\u2217 \u2248 32; that relative scale\nis similar to the geometry in the case of Jupiter's magnetosphere, for which RM P /RJ = 42 (e.g.,\nWalker and Russell, 1995).\nTo estimate how much power the ISM wind might impart onto a stellar bowshock and potentially into the stellar magnetosphere, we estimate the power in the bulk kinetic energy over the\n2 :\ncross section of the bow shock with cross section \u03c0RCF\n20\n\nPw \u2248 3 \u00d7 10\n\n3\nn0 v100\n\n\u0012\n\nRCF\nR\u2217\n\n\u00132 \u0012\n\nR\u2217\nR\u2299\n\n\u00132\n\n,\n\n(11)\n\nso that at n0 = 0.1, v100 = 0.4, and R\u2217 = 0.3R\u2299 , Pw \u2248 1020\u221222 erg/s for characteristic M7 to L5\nstars. This lies orders of magnitude below the H\u03b1 and X-ray luminosities (see Table 1) and below\nthe power that needs to be extracted from the stellar rotation with age (see below). Hence, the\nISM wind is not a significant source of magnetospheric activity in dwarf stars through mid-L, even\nif it shapes a close-in asteropause.\n\n4.\n\nFrom a stellar corona to a planetary magnetosphere\n\nAs the solar-like corona fades away from mid-M to mid-L, one may expect increasing signatures of a rotation-dominated magnetosphere towards late L-type stars like that for Jupiter. In\nsuch a magnetosphere, energy is taken from star's rotational energy through a torque applied by\noutflowing plasma. The energy loss, Wrot , can be estimated from the rotation-age relationship.\nReiners and Basri (2008) infer time scales for magnetic braking that increase from about 3 Gyr for\nan M7 star to 7 Gyr for an L2 star, and over 10 Gyr for an L5 star (the latter is relatively poorly\nconstrained and, perhaps, much larger). Using\nWrot =\n\nd 1 2\nI\u03a9\ndt 2\n\n(12)\n\nyeidls Wrot \u223c 1026 ergs/s (Table 1). In the early L-type range, this is comparable to WC from\nEq. (9) that could be taken away by the outflow from the relatively weak corona, i.e., that would\nbe plausibly consistent with the existence of such a weak corona. But both Wrot and WC exceed\nX-ray and H\u03b1 losses, i.e., the rotational energy loss exceeds the radiative losses, in contrast to what\nis seen in warmer solar-type stars.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nLet us now explore an order-of-magnitude scaling for the power expected from a rotationallydominated magnetosphere. Fan et al. (1982) argue for a scaling based on a dimensional analysis\n('principle of similitude') that relates the magnetic moment, MB = Bl3 , the rotation period, P ,\nand the radius, Ra , at which the acceleration process begins to the power, W \u2032 , generated:\nW\u2032 =\n\n4\u03c0 2 K MB2\n,\nc2 P 2 Ra\n\n(13)\n\nwhere the constant K has to follow from a measurement until a full theory is developed. Based\non the properties in Table 1, using a mean photosperic field strength of 1.5 kG, and with RS for\nRa , values are found for 10 log(K * Wrot /W \u2032 ) of 0.6, 0.4, and 0.6 for the characteristic M7, L2, and\nL5 stars, respectively. Fan et al. (1982) estimate a range of values for the constant 10 log(K) for\nJupiter from \u22121.7 to \u22120.7. The value of K for Jupiter lies, remarkably, within the range of values\nneeded to let Wrot and W \u2032 be comparable for the stars in Table 1. In contrast, this scaling applied\nto the Sun yields log(W\u2299\u2032 ) \u223c 21.3 \u2212 22.3, which is well over a thousand times less. At least W \u2032 for\nultracool dwarfs is much larger than the solar value, while with the only available calibration point\n- Jupiter - one concludes that W \u2032 is close to both Wrot and WC for an early L-type star.\n\n5.\n\nDiscussion and conclusions\n\nSomewhere along the spectrum of stars, brown dwarfs, and planets a transition from an outflowdriven asterosphere to a field-shielded rotating magnetosphere must occur. Based on the observational evidence, I argue that this transition occurs at the bottom end of the true stellar range of the\nmain sequence: for stars cooler than about spectral type M5, the properties characteristic of solarlike activity progressively disappear, while, in contrast to warmer stars, magnetic braking extracts\nmore energy from the star than needed to power the chromospheric H\u03b1 and (weak) coronal X-ray\nemissions. Objects cooler than about L0-L2 may exhibit outer-atmospheric phenomena similar to\nthose in the rotation-driven magnetosphere of Jupiter rather than to those in convection-driven\ncorona and wind of the Sun.\nThe energetics of the main auroral oval of Jupiter dominate over the phenomena associated\nwith the lower-latitude structures that are connected directly with the movement of Io, Europa,\nand Ganymede through the jovian magnetic field, and those associated with the higher-latitude\npolar-cap emissions that appear to be driven by the solar wind. Jupiter's main auroral oval is not\n- in contrast to Earth's - the separator between open and closed planetary magnetic field in the\ninteraction with the interplanetary magnetic field, but instead is mapped to lower-latitude closed\nmagnetic field (see, e.g., the summarizing discussion by Cowley et al., 2003). This auroral structure\nis thought to be generated by the precipitation of energetic electrons created by the electric current\nsystem that is involved in a phenomenon referred to as \"corotation\" (or rather the breakdown\nthereof) in the middle magnetosphere: beyond the interface where the jovian magnetic field is\nstrong enough to enforce corotation of the plasma, a current-system is induced that includes a\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\ndisk-shaped near-equatorial extrusion in which field and plasma interact through Lorentz forces to\nextract energy from the planet's rotation.\nIf the rotation of the coolest dwarf stars similarly powers their magnetosphere, this energy is\nultimately drawn from the energy of rotation. In the case of the Jupiter, Io and Ganymede provide\nplasma conveniently high in the magnetosphere, outside the distance of geosynchronous rotation\nbut within the Alfv\u00e9n radius. In the case of the ultra-cool dwarf stars, it is of course possible\nthat one or more close-in planets act as a similar plasma source, but rather than postulating such\nplanets, I hypothesize that plasma is provided by a tenuous hot stellar corona formed either by\nresidual solar-like activity (perhaps associated with the overturning field of a turbulent dynamo) or\nmagnetospheric activity (somehow formed by the breakdown of corotation). How, quantitatively,\nthis balance changes between L0 and L5 remains to be established.\nFor stars up to late-M, the power extracted from the stellar rotation lies below the characteristic\nH\u03b1 and X-ray emissions. The estimated rate Wrot at which rotational energy is lost from an L2-type\ndwarf, in contrast, is larger than the characteristic outer-atmospheric losses based on the coronal\nX-ray luminosity. In the scenario of the rotationally-dominated magnetosphere, Eviatar and Siscoe\n(1980) argued that at most half of the total power taken from Jupiter's rotational energy would\nbe available for radiative emissions, including the aurorae. The rough estimate of the radiative\nlosses of L-type dwarfs (as reflected by LX ) is not inconsistent with that argument, but further\nobservations are needed to test this in more detail.\nThe quiescent radio emission from F\u2013M type stars appears to be predominantly gyrosynchrotron emission from high-energy coronal electrons (see, e.g., the review by G\u00fcdel, 2002). Hallinan et al.\n(2008) argued that the radio signal of several very cool dwarf stars (M8.5, M9, and L3.5) is associated with the electron cyclotron maser (ECM) process; they base that argument on the observation\nthat the radio signal is periodically fully circularly polarized, whereas there is also an unpolarized\ncomponent which they attribute to depolarized ECM emission because its brightness temperature\nis incompatible with incoherent synchrotron radiation. They pointed out that the ECM mechanism is thought to be responsible for kHz\u2013MHz emission from Jupiter (cf., the review by Zarka,\n1998). Thus, both the enhanced radio to X-ray ratio and the radio polarization signature support\nthe analogy of the magnetospheric processes around Jupiter and around ultracool radidly-rotating\ndwarf stars.\nThe plasma transport in the magnetosphere of Jupiter, is thought to occur by convective\ncells triggered by the centrifugal interchange instability, in which cool, dense volumes change places\nwith hotter, less dense volumes (e.g., Hill et al., 2005, Chen and Hill, 2008). In the case of ultracool\ndwarf stars, the stellar equivalent of this process into the stellar magnetotail shaped by the ISM\nwind could be the process by which angular momentum is removed from the star.\nIn view of the arguments discussed in this paper, it appears warranted to consider the possibility\nof a very similar system of currents in the case of main-sequence stars cooler than about L0 as in\nthe jovian magnetosphere. Perhaps much, if not most, of the H\u03b1 emission and the relatively weak\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\ncoronal X-ray in stars cooler than L0 is associated with activity (including aurorae) driven by\nthe breakdown of corotation like they occur on a smaller scale for Jupiter, while the stellar radio\nemission may be a signature of high-energy particles accelerated in that process. A dimensional\nanalysis, developed by Fan et al. (1982), applied to the case of L-type stars supports this hypothesis\nquantitatively.\nI thank G.L. Siscoe, J.L. Linsky, and B. de Pontieu for helpful discussions and for their comments on the manuscript.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nREFERENCES\nAllen, C.
