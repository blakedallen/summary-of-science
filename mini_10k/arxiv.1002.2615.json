Sun: chromosphere - Sun: magnetic fields \u2013 Stars: atmospheres\n\n1. Introduction\nThe chromosphere is a crucial boundary region in the solar outer atmosphere, not only because it is probably the region where the dominant physics changes from hydrodynamic to\nmagnetic forces and most of the non-radiative\nheating that sustains the corona and solar wind\nis released, but also because the dissipation\nof magnetic energy in the 106 K corona may\nbe significantly modulated by the strength and\nstructure of the magnetic field in the chromosphere (e.g., Parker 2007). Unfortunately,\nour empirical knowledge of the magnetism of\nthe solar outer atmosphere is practically nonexistent notwithstanding the precious qualitative information provided by high resolution\nimages of the solar atmosphere taken around\nthe wavelengths of strong spectral lines like\nH\u03b1 and Ca ii 8542 \u00c5 (e.g., the review by Rutten\nSend offprint requests to: J. Trujillo Bueno\n\n2007). Such high cadence, high angular resolution intensity images demonstrate that the solar\nchromospheric plasma is extremely inhomogeneous and dynamic and suggest that the upper\nsolar chromosphere is a \"fibrilar dominatedmagnetism medium\". They are also useful in\nhelping to constrain the magnetic field orientation, but they do not provide quantitative information on the magnetic field vector because\nthe Stokes I(\u03bb) profiles of such strong lines are\npractically insensitive to its strength, inclination and azimuth. Most probably the magnetic\nfield is the underlying structuring agent, but\nthe fine structure that we see in such intensity\nimages (i.e., the fibrils) directly implies only\nthe presence of thermal and/or density inhomogeneities.\nThe only way to obtain quantitative\nempirical information on the magnetic\nfields of the extended solar atmosphere\nis via the measurement and interpretation\n\n\fTrujillo Bueno: The Magnetism of the Quiet Solar Chromosphere\n\nof the emergent spectral line polarization\n(e.g., Stenflo 1994; Del Toro Iniesta 2003;\nLandi Degl'Innocenti & Landolfi 2004). Solar\nmagnetic fields leave their fingerprints on\nthe polarization signatures of the emergent\nspectral line radiation. This occurs through a\nvariety of unfamiliar physical mechanisms,\nnot only via the Zeeman effect. In particular,\nmagnetic fields modify the atomic level\npolarization (population imbalances and\nquantum coherences) that pumping processes\nby anisotropic radiation induce in the atoms\nof the solar atmosphere (e.g., Trujillo Bueno\n2001). Interestingly, this so-called Hanle\neffect allows us to \"see\" magnetic fields to\nwhich the Zeeman effect is blind within the\nlimitations of the available and foreseeable\ninstrumentation. We may thus define \"the\nSun's hidden magnetism\" as all the magnetic\nfields of the extended solar atmosphere that are\nimpossible to diagnose via the consideration\nof the Zeeman effect alone.\nA recent review of observational properties of the solar chromosphere was presented by Judge (2006). There are also reviews where the reader finds information\non how spectropolarimetric observations allow us to explore chromospheric magnetic\nfields in quiet and active regions (e.g.,\nHarvey 2006, 2009; Stenflo 2006; Lagg\n2007; Casini & Landi Degl'Innocenti 2007;\nL\u00f3pez Ariste & Aulanier 2007; Trujillo Bueno\n2010). In Trujillo Bueno (2010) I dicuss recent advances in chromospheric and coronal\npolarization diagnostics, with emphasis on the\nmagnetic field of plasma structures embedded\nin the solar outer atmosphere (e.g., spicules,\nprominences, active region filaments and coronal loops). Of particular interest in this respect is the very recent paper by Centeno et al.\n(2010) showing the detection of magnetic\nfields as strong as 50 G in off-limb spicules\nof the quiet Sun chromosphere, which could\nrepresent a possible lower value of the field\nstrength of organized network spicules at a\nheight of about 2000 km above the visible solar\nsurface.\nIn the present paper I focus instead on the\ndiagnostic problem of the magnetization of the\natmosphere of the \"quiet\" Sun, with emphasis\n\n283\n\non the variation with height of the mean field\nstrength in the quiet chromospheric plasma itself. It is important to note that determining the\nmean magnetization of the quiet Sun requires\nfinding how much flux resides at small scales.\nTo this end, it is crucial to measure and interpret the linear polarization produced by atomic\nlevel polarization and its modification by the\nHanle effect (see \u00a72 and \u00a73). Although in the\nquiet Sun the amplitudes of such linear polarization signals are often larger than those\nof the V/I profiles produced by the longitudinal Zeeman effect, their measurement with\nthe available telescopes still requires to sacrifice the spatio-temporal resolution to be able\nto reach the required polarimetric sensitivity.\nFor this reason, with present telescope apertures, the first step is to try to obtain information on the mean intensity, hBi, of the actual distribution of magnetic field strengths.\nThe shape of the ensuing probability distribution funtion, PDF(B), describing the fraction of\nquiet Sun plasma occupied by magnetic fields\nof strength B, is difficult to determine empirically, although numerical experiments of\nmagnetoconvection suggest that assuming an\nexponential shape for the PDF is a suitable\napproximation that avoids overestimating hBi.\nNevertheless, here I consider mainly the simplest model of a single value field that fills the\nentire atmospheric volume (i.e., PDF(B)=\u03b4(B\u2212\nhBi)), with the aim of drawing at least some\npreliminary conclusions on the lower limit for\nhBi in the photosphere (\u00a74), upper chromosphere (\u00a75) and lower chromosphere (\u00a76). In\nterms of the heights h (in km) above the visible solar surface where the spectral lines used\nhere are sensitive to the local atmospheric conditions we have 200 . h . 400 for the photosphere, 1800 . h . 2200 for the \"upper chromosphere\", and 900 . h . 1300 for the \"lower\nchromosphere\".\n\n2. Pros and Cons of the Hanle and\nZeeman Effects\nThe polarization of the Zeeman effect is due\nto the wavelength shifts between the \u03c0 and\n\u03c3 transitions composing a spectral line.

In practice,\nonly the impact of the Zeeman effect on\nStokes V is detected, and mainly in near-IR\nlines like the 8542 \u00c5 line of Ca ii. However,\nthe response function of the emergent Stokes\nV to magnetic field perturbations at various\nheights in models of the quiet solar atmosphere indicates that the circular polarization\nproduced by the Zeeman effect in spectral\nlines like H\u03b1 and Ca ii 8542 \u00c5 is insensitive to the physical conditions of the upper\nchromosphere (e.g., Socas-Navarro et al.\n2000; Socas-Navarro & Uitenbroek 2004;\nUitenbroek 2006). For example, Fig. 1 illustrates that in the quiet Sun the circular\npolarization of the H\u03b1 line is sensitive mainly\nto the photospheric magnetic field (see also\nSocas-Navarro & Uitenbroek 2004). The\nemergent Stokes V profiles in the k-line of\nMg ii and in Ly\u03b1 show a more favourable\nsensitivity to magnetic fields in the upper solar\nchromosphere and transition region, but the\nexpected Stokes V signals are very weak (see\n\n2.0\n0.5\n1.5\n0.0\n1.0\n\nRV,B [relative units]\n\nlar polarization produced by the longitudinal\nZeeman effect is an antisymmetric Stokes V(\u03bb)\nprofile whose amplitude scales with the ratio, R, between the Zeeman splitting and the\nDoppler broadened line width. The linear polarization amplitudes of the transverse Zeeman\neffect scale instead as R2 and its characteristic\nobservational signatures are symmetric Stokes\nQ(\u03bb) and U(\u03bb) profiles with their wing lobes of\nopposite sign to the line center one. Due to cancellation effects the polarization of the Zeeman\neffect as a diagnostic tool tends to be blind to\nmagnetic fields that are randomly oriented on\nscales too small to be resolved.

In summary, the Zeeman effect is of\nlimited practical interest for the exploration of\nmagnetic fields in the solar outer atmosphere\n(chromosphere, transition region and corona).\nFortunately, there is yet another physical\nmechanism by means of which the magnetic\nfields of the solar atmosphere leave fingerprints\non the polarization of the emergent spectral\nline radiation: the Hanle effect. Anisotropic\nradiation pumping processes produce atomic\nlevel polarization (i.e., population imbalances\nand quantum coherences among the magnetic\nsublevels pertaining to any given degenerate\nenergy level). The Hanle effect can be defined as any modification of the atomic level\npolarization due to the presence of a magnetic field, including the remarkable effects\nproduced by the level crossings and repulsions\nthat take place when going from the Zeeman\neffect regime to the complete Paschen-Back\neffect regime (e.g., Belluzzi et al. 2007). The\nHanle effect is especially sensitive to magnetic\nstrengths between 0.1 BH and 10 BH , where\nBH = (1.137 \u00d7 10\u22127 )/(tlife g J )\n\n(2)\n\nis the critical Hanle field intensity (in gauss) for\nwhich the Zeeman splitting of the J-level under consideration is similar to its natural width.\nNote that g J is the level's Land\u00e9 factor and tlife\nits radiative lifetime in seconds. Since the lifetimes of the upper levels of the transitions of\ninterest are usually much smaller than those of\n\n\fTrujillo Bueno: The Magnetism of the Quiet Solar Chromosphere\n\n285\n\nthe lower levels, clearly diagnostic techniques\nbased on the lower-level Hanle effect are sensitive to much weaker fields than those based on\nthe upper-level Hanle effect.\nThe main properties of the Hanle effect are:\n(a) The Hanle effect is sensitive to weaker\nmagnetic fields than the Zeeman effect (from\nat least 1 mG to a few hundred gauss), regardless of how large the line width due to\nDoppler broadening is. For stronger fields, the\nHanle effect remains sensitive to the magnetic\nfield orientation. Moreover, the Hanle effect is\nsensitive to magnetic fields that are randomly\noriented on scales too small to be resolved\n(Stenflo 1982; Trujillo Bueno et al. 2004).\n(b) The Hanle effect as a diagnostic tool\nis not limited to a narrow solar limb zone.\nIn particular, in the forward scattering geometry of a solar disk center observation, the\nHanle effect creates linear polarization in the\npresence of an inclined magnetic field (e.g.,\nTrujillo Bueno et al. 2002).\n(c) The Hanle effect operates in the line\ncore and the ensuing response function of\nthe emergent linear polarization to magnetic\nfield perturbations shows that in some spectral lines (e.g., Ca ii 8542 \u00c5, H\u03b1, Mg ii k\nand Ly\u03b1) is sensitive to the magnetic fields\nof the upper chromosphere and transition region (see a H\u03b1 response function in figure 4 of\n\u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n & Trujillo Bueno 2010a).\nIn summary, the Hanle effect in strong\nspectral lines is the key physical mechanism\nthat should be increasingly exploited for quantitative explorations of the magnetism of the\nsolar chromosphere.\n\nthe atomic density matrix that are consistent\nwith the intensity, polarization and symmetry\nproperties of the radiation field generated\nwithin the (generally magnetized) medium\nunder consideration. Once such density matrix\nelements are known it is straighforward to\nsolve the Stokes vector transfer equation\nto obtain the emergent Stokes profiles for\nany desired line of sight. Highly efficient\niterative methods and accurate formal solvers\nof the Stokes vector transfer equation were\ndeveloped for solving this type of (complete\nredistribution) multilevel radiative transfer\nproblem (see the review by Trujillo Bueno\n2003). Such methods have been implemented\nin multilevel computer programs for the\ngeneration and transfer of polarized radiation\n(Manso Sainz & Trujillo Bueno 2003a; \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n\n2008; Trujillo Bueno & Shchukina 2007,\n2009). Moreover, the same radiative transfer\nmethods have been recently generalized by\nSampoorna & Trujillo Bueno (2010) for solving the two-level atom problem of resonance\nline polarization taking into account partial\nredistribution effects, which may be a suitable\napproximation for modeling the fractional\nlinear polarization profiles in Ly\u03b1 and Mg ii k.\nThe following sections discuss how\nthe modeling of spectropolarimetric observations through the application of the\nabove-mentioned radiative transfer codes\nallows us to obtain information on the mean\nmagnetization of the quiet solar atmosphere.\n\n3. Forward modeling of the spectral\nline polarization\n\nThe linear polarization profiles produced\nby scattering processes in the quiet solar atmosphere have been observed with\npoor spatial and/or temporal resolution (e.g.,\nStenflo & Keller 1997; Gandorfer 2000). For\nthis reason, Trujillo Bueno et al. (2004) confronted observations of the center-to-limb variation of the scattering polarization in the photospheric Sr i 4607 \u00c5 line with calculations of\nthe Q/I profiles that result from spatially averaging the emergent Q and I profiles calculated in a three-dimensional (3D) model of the\nquiet solar photosphere resulting from realis-\n\nIn general, the modeling of the Stokes profiles\nin strong lines like H\u03b1 and the IR triplet\nof Ca ii requires solving a rather complicated radiative transfer problem, known\nas the non-LTE problem of the 2nd kind\n(Landi Degl'Innocenti & Landolfi\n2004).\nThis consists in calculating, at each spatial\npoint of any given atmospheric model and\nfor each J-level of the chosen atomic model,\nthe diagonal and non-diagonal elements of\n\n4.

The very significant discrepancy between the calculated and the observed\npolarization amplitudes indicated the ubiquitous existence of tangled magnetic fields in the\nquiet solar photosphere, with a mean strength\nsignificantly larger than derived from simplistic one-dimensional radiative transfer investigations (see the review by Trujillo Bueno et al.\n2006). The inferred mean strength of this hidden field turned out to be hBi\u223c100 G (see Fig.\n2), which implies an amount of magnetic energy density that is more than sufficient to compensate the energy losses of the solar outer atmosphere. This estimation was obtained by using the approximation of a microturbulent field\n(i.e., that the hidden field has an isotropic distribution of orientations within a photospheric\nvolume given by L3 , with L the mean-freepath of the line-center photons). Calculations\nbased on the assumption that the unresolved\nmagnetic field is instead horizontal also lead\nto the conclusion of a sizable hBi (see \u00a7 4 in\nTrujillo Bueno et al. 2006).\nWhat is the physical origin of this\n\"hidden\" magnetic field whose reality is\nnow being supported by Lites et al. (2008)\nand Orozco Su\u00e1rez et al. (2007) through highspatial-resolution observations of the Zeeman\neffect taken with Hinode? Is it mostly the result of dynamo action by near-surface convection, as suggested by Cattaneo (1999)? Or\nis it dominated by small-scale flux emergence\nfrom deeper layers and recycling by the granulation flows? The fact that the inferred magnetic energy density is a significant fraction\n(i.e., \u223c20%) of the kinetic energy density, and\nthat the scattering polarization observed in the\nSr i 4607 \u00c5 line does not seem to be modulated by the solar cycle, strongly supported\nthe suggestion that a surface dynamo plays a\nsignificant role for the quiet Sun magnetism\n(see Trujillo Bueno et al. 2004). Recent radiative MHD simulations of dynamo action by\nnear-surface convection also support this possibility (V\u00f6gler & Sch\u00fcssler 2007).\nIn summary, the small-scale magnetic activity of the quiet Sun photosphere is indeed\nvery significant and might be important for understanding the propagation of energy into the\n\nFig. 2.

The symbols correspond to various\nobservations taken by several authors during a minimum and a maximum of the solar activity cycle. The\ndotted, dashed and solid lines (colored in the online\nversion) show scattering polarization calculations in\na 3D hydrodynamical model of the photosphere, assuming a volume-filling, single-value microturbulent field with the following magnetic strengths (in\nG): 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100, 150,\n200, 250 and 300. The best overall fit to the observations is obtained for 60 G, but note that the best\nfit is achieved with 70 G at \u03bc = 0.6 (h\u2248200 km) and\nwith 50 G at \u03bc = 0.1 (h\u2248400 km). With a more realistic exponential probability distribution function\n(black, dashed-dotted line), the best overall fit is obtained for hBi=130 G, and note again that there is a\nclear indication that hBi increases with depth. These\nresults demonstrate that there is a vast amount of\n\"hidden\" magnetic energy in the quiet solar photosphere, which is much more than sufficient to balance the radiative energy losses of the solar outer\natmosphere.

The possibility that with the \"Zeeman\neyes of Hinode\" we might still be seeing only\nthe \"tip of the iceberg\" of the quiet Sun magnetism is not surprising because 80% or more\nof the vertical unsigned flux seems to be invisible to observations of the Zeeman effect at\nHinode's resolution of 200 km owing to the\ncancellation of the Stokes V signal from opposite magnetic polarities (Pietarila Graham\net al. 2009; see also Stenflo 1994; Emonet &\n\n\fTrujillo Bueno: The Magnetism of the Quiet Solar Chromosphere\n\nCattaneo 2001; S\u00e1nchez Almeida et al. 2003;\nMart\u0131\u0301nez Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2010).\n\n5. The magnetization of the upper\nchromosphere of the quiet Sun\nThere are various spectral lines whose Q/I and\nU/I profiles are sensitive to the magnetization\nof the upper chromosphere of the quiet Sun,\nsuch as those considered below. It is, however,\nnecessary to emphasize that determining hBi\nfrom the observed fractional linear polarization signals usually requires confronting them\nwith those that the highly inhomogeneous and\ndynamic solar chromospheric plasma would\nproduce if it were unmagnetized. This strategy could be applied successfully for determining the mean magnetization of the quiet solar photosphere by solving the radiative transfer problem for the Sr i 4607 \u00c5 line in a\nrealistic three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical model (see \u00a74), but a similar approach\nfor instead inferring the magnetization of the\nquiet chromospheric plasma is not yet possible\nmainly because to produce a realistic 3D model\nof the thermal, density and dynamic structure\nof the quiet chromosphere is still computationally prohibitive (e.g., Carlsson 2007). As a\nmatter of fact, the current 3D models do not\nshow fibrils in Ca ii 8542 \u00c5 and the synthetic\nH\u03b1 line-center intensity images show instead\nthe granulation pattern (e.g., Leenaarts 2010).\nShould we then abandon any attempt to infer\nthe magnetization of the quiet chromosphere\nvia multilevel radiative transfer modeling using the available 1D semi-empirical models ?\nIn my opinion, the solar chromosphere is such\nan important region that we should at least try\nto do something potentially useful in spite of\nthe obvious fact that any such 1D model is\na poor representation of the complex chromospheric conditions.\n\n5.1. The Ca ii 8542 \u00c5 line\nThe circular polarization of the Ca ii IR triplet\nis caused by the longitudinal Zeeman effect.\nWith the available telescopes the ensuing V/I\nsignals are measurable even in quiet regions,\nwhere their amplitudes are \u223c10\u22123 and smaller.\n\n287\n\nUnfortunately, the Zeeman effect in the IR\ntriplet of Ca ii is of little practical interest for\ninvestigating the magnetism of the upper solar\nchromosphere. Calculations of the Stokes V response function of the strongest line of the Ca ii\nIR triplet to perturbations in the magnetic field\nstrength show that in semi-empirical models of\nthe quiet solar atmosphere the emergent circular polarization is sensitive only to changes between 700 and 1200 km, approximately (e.g.,\nUitenbroek 2006).\nIn quiet regions the linear polarization of\nthe Ca ii IR triplet is dominated by atomic\nlevel polarization and its modification by the\nHanle effect. Typically, the ensuing Q/I and\nU/I profiles have their maximum values at\nthe line center. While the linear polarization\nin the 8498 \u00c5 line shows sensitivity to inclined magnetic fields with strengths between\n1 mG and 50 G, the emergent linear polarization in the 8542 \u00c5 and 8662 \u00c5 lines is\nsensitive to magnetic fields with strengths in\nthe milligauss range (see Fig. 3). The reason for this very interesting behavior is that\nthe scattering polarization in the 8498 \u00c5 line\ngets a significant contribution from the selective emission processes that result from the\natomic polarization of the short-lived upper\nlevel, while that in the 8542 \u00c5 and 8662 \u00c5\nlines is dominated by the selective absorption\nprocesses that result from the atomic polarization of the metastable (long-lived) lower levels\n(Manso Sainz & Trujillo Bueno 2003b, 2007).\nTherefore, in quiet regions of the solar atmosphere the magnetic sensitivity of the linear\npolarization of the 8542 \u00c5 and 8662 \u00c5 lines\nis controlled by the lower-level Hanle effect,\nwhich implies that in regions with B > 1 G\ntheir Stokes Q and U profiles are only sensitive\nto the orientation of the magnetic field vector.\nThe most diagnostically interesting lines\nof the Ca ii IR triplet are the strongest and\nthe weakest (i.e., the 8542 \u00c5 and the 8498\n\u00c5 lines, respectively). Their linear polarization signals resulting from atomic level polarization and the Hanle effect can be exploited\nto explore the thermal and magnetic structure of the solar chromosphere. They should\nalso be used to evaluate the degree of realism of 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations\n\n\f288\n\nTrujillo Bueno: The Magnetism of the Quiet Solar Chromosphere\n8662\n\n8542\n\n8498\n0.05\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0.04\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\nQ/I (%)\n\n0.03\n\n10\n0.1\n\n90\n\n90\n\n0.1\n\n30\n\n0.01\n\n90\n0.00\n\n30\n\n30\n\n0.02\n\n60\n\n0.0\n\n60\n\n0.0\n\n60\n10-4\n\n10-2\n100\nB (G)\n\n102\n\n10-4\n\n10-2\n100\nB (G)\n\n102\n\n10-4\n\n10-2\n100\nB (G)\n\n102\n\nFig. 3.

From Manso Sainz & Trujillo Bueno (2010).\nof the chromosphere via careful comparisons\nof the Stokes profiles obtained through forward\nmodeling calculations with those observed in\nquiet regions (e.g., like the ones in Fig. 4).\nAs mentioned above, the current 3D models\ndo not show fibrils in the synthetic intensity\nimages calculated at the core of Ca ii 8542\n\u00c5, in spite of the fact that the snapshot chosen by Leenaarts et al. (2010) has hBi=150 G\n(i.e., a value in agreement with that inferred by\nTrujillo Bueno et al. 2004).\nIn particular, the linear polarization of the\n8542 \u00c5 line should be increasingly exploited\nto explore the magnetic field structure of the\nupper chromosphere, ideally via high angular resolution two-dimensional (2D) spectropolarimetry with large aperture telescopes and\nnovel instruments like IBIS, CRISP or the\nG\u00f6ttingen Fabry-Perot. One drawback is that\nfor B > 1 G the scattering polarization of the\nCa ii 8542 \u00c5 line is sensitive only to the orientation of the magnetic field vector. Therefore,\nin principle, from the spatial variations of the\nQ/I and U/I signals we can see in Fig. 4 we\ncan only say that they are probably due to\n\nchanges in the orientation of the magnetic field\nin the upper chromosphere of the quiet Sun.\nAlthough the spatio-temporal resolution of this\nspectropolarimetric observation is rather low\n(i.e., no better than 3\u2032\u2032 and 20 minutes), the\nfractional polarization amplitudes fluctuate between 10\u22124 and 10\u22123 along the spatial direction of the spectrograph slit, with a typical spatial scale of 5\u2032\u2032 . Interestingly enough, while the\nStokes Q/I signal changes in amplitude but remains always positive along that spatial direction, the sign of the Stokes U/I signal fluctuates. This is compatible with the action of\nthe Hanle effect in a magnetized plasma with\nB > 1 G and having a spatially varying magnetic field azimuth, which in turn is consistent with the possibility that the fibrils seen in\nthe high-resolution intensity images taken by\nCauzzi et al. (2008) at the line center of \u03bb8542\ntrace out magnetic lines of force.\n\n\fTrujillo Bueno: The Magnetism of the Quiet Solar Chromosphere\n\nI/Ic\n\nQ/I\n\nU/I\n\n289\n\nV/I\n\nFig. 4.

The H\u03b1 line\nAs we have seen, the linear polarization of the\nCa ii 8542 \u00c5 line is sensitive to the orientation of the magnetic field in the upper chromosphere of the quiet Sun, but not to its strength\nunless B < 1 G there. In order to obtain empirical information on the magnetic strength in\nthe upper chromosphere we need to use similarly strong lines, but such that their scattering\npolarization is sensitive to magnetic strengths\nin the gauss range. Among the various possible choices, H\u03b1 is particularly interesting because it reaches the Hanle saturation regime\nfor B&50 G and the shape of its fractional\nscattering polarization profile is very sensitive to the presence of magnetic field gradients\nin the upper chromosphere of the quiet Sun\n(\u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n & Trujillo Bueno 2010b). Moreover,\nthe fibrilar nature of the upper chromosphere is\nseen even more clearly in H\u03b1, especially when\nobserving quiet regions far away from the solar\ndisk center (e.g., see figure 7 of Rutten 2007).\nIn the remaining part of this section I summarize the main results of this recent paper by\n\u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n & Trujillo Bueno (2010b).\nThe temperature minimum region of solar\natmospheric models is transparent to H\u03b1 radiation (Schoolman 1972). As a result, we see\nthe upper chromosphere at the very line center of the H\u03b1 line but the photosphere in the\nline wings. It is thus not surprising what Fig.\n1 shows for H\u03b1, namely that the response of\nthe emergent circular polarization induced by\nthe Zeeman effect to magnetic field perturbations exhibits large photospheric contributions.\n\nMoreover, in the quiet Sun the V/I signals are\nvery weak (\u223c10\u22124 and smaller).\nOn the contrary, in quiet regions the linear\npolarization observed in H\u03b1 is fully dominated\nby the presence of radiatively induced population imbalances and quantum coherences\namong the magnetic sublevels of the line's levels, which produce linear polarization profiles\nwhose maximum values are located at the very\nline center. The fractional polarization amplitudes vary between 10\u22123 and 10\u22124 . Moreover,\nthis scattering line polarization is modified by\nthe Hanle effect, which operates mainly in\nthe line core and gives rise to Q/I and U/I\nprofiles different from those corresponding to\nthe zero-field case. The response function of\nthe emergent linear polarization to magnetic\nfield perturbations shows that the Hanle effect in H\u03b1 is sensitive to the magnetic fields\nof the upper chromosphere (see figure 4 of\n\u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n & Trujillo Bueno 2010a).\nIn spite of its modeling difficulties, the\nHanle effect in H\u03b1 should be exploited for\nfacilitating quantitative explorations of the\nmagnetism of the upper solar chromosphere.\nA first step has been recently taken by\n\u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n & Trujillo Bueno (2010b). The dashed\nline in the right panel of Fig. 5 shows the spatially and temporally averaged Q/I profile observed by Gandorfer (2000) in a quiet region\nat about 5 arcseconds from the solar limb. Its\nmore peculiar feature is the asymmetry that\nit shows around the line center, which cannot be explained by the mere fact that the H\u03b1\nline results from the superposition of seven\nblended components, four of which making a\nsignificant contribution to Stokes Q.

The total Q/I profiles include the contribution of the continuum\npolarization. Note that for a line of sight with \u03bc = 0.1 the scattering polarization of the H\u03b1 line is sensitive\nto the structure of the magnetic field only in the atmospheric region indicated by the solid line part of the\nmodel. For more information see \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n & Trujillo Bueno (2010b).\n\npaper \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n & Trujillo Bueno (2010b) argue\nthat the observed Q/I profile can be explained\nby the Hanle effect of an inclined magnetic\nfield whose mean strength varies with height\nas approximately indicated in the left panel\nof Fig. 5. This suggests the presence of an\nabrupt and significant magnetization in the upper chromosphere of the quiet Sun and that the\naverage ratio \u03b2 of gas to magnetic pressure decreases suddenly there.\n\n6. The magnetization of the lower\nchromosphere of the quiet Sun\nThe magnetic field model in the left panel of\nFig. 5 is characterized by a magnetic complexity zone with hBi>30 G in the upper solar chromosphere (i.e., just below the sudden transition\nregion to the 106 K coronal temperatures) and\nby a strongly magnetized photosphere and a\nweakly magnetized lower chromosphere. The\nsuggested abrupt magnetization in the upper\nchromosphere of the quiet Sun is introduced\nto produce a Q/I profile with a line center\nasymmetry similar to that found in the observed profile. The strong magnetization of the\nmodel's photospheric region is strongly supported by the 3D radiative transfer modeling\n\nof the scattering polarization observed in the Sr\ni 4607 \u00c5 line (see Trujillo Bueno et al. 2004),\nwhich indicates that the bulk of the quiet solar photosphere is teeming with a distribution of tangled magnetic fields having a mean\nstrength hBi\u224860 G (when estimating hBi assuming the simplest case, adopted in \u00a75 and \u00a76\nof this paper, of a single value field strength).\nIs the mean magnetization of the lower chromosphere really as weak as indicated in Fig. 5\n(i.e., with hBi.10 G around a height of 1000\nkm) ?\nOne spectral line whose observed scattering polarization supports the possibility of a\nweakly magnetized lower chromosphere is the\nD2 line of Ba ii at 4554 \u00c5 (see Belluzzi et al.\n2007). Figure 6 shows the sensitivity of the\nemergent Q/I profile to the magnetic field\nstrength, both for the case of a microturbulent and isotropically distributed magnetic field\n(left panel) and for the case of a randomazimuth horizontal field (right panel). In fact,\nthe Q/I profile observed by Stenflo & Keller\n(1997) has a three-peak structure, very similar\nto that shown by the solid lines in Fig. 6. Note\nthat for B&10 G the amplitude of the central\nQ/I peak is smaller than the amplitudes of the\nwing peaks, contrary to what the observed Q/I\n\n\fTrujillo Bueno: The Magnetism of the Quiet Solar Chromosphere\n\n291\n\nFig. 6.

Another spectral line whose linear polarization suggests that the lower chromosphere of the quiet Sun has a small hBi\nvalue is the Na i D1 line (see the review by\nTrujillo Bueno 2009).\n\n7. Concluding comments\n\nQ/I amplitudes are also sensitive to collisions\nwith neutral hydrogen atoms (e.g., the case of\nthe Sr i 4607 \u00c5 line) and protons (e.g., the case\nof H\u03b1). Through the Hanle effect the emergent\nQ/I profiles are also sensitive to the presence\nof magnetic fields inclined with respect to the\nsymmetry axis of the incident radiation field.\n\nThree are the main conclusions to be drawn\nhere:\n(1) The bulk of the quiet solar photosphere\nis strongly magnetized, with hBi\u223c100 G when\nno distinction is made between granules and\nintergranules.\n(2) The lower chromosphere seems to be\nweakly magnetized, with hBi<10 G.\n(3) The magnetization of the upper chromosphere of the quiet Sun is abrupt and significant, with hBi>30 G just below the sudden\ntransition region to the 106 K coronal plasma.\nAre these conclusions reliable? They are\nbased on radiative transfer modeling of the\nscattering polarization Q/I profiles of some\nspectral lines observed without spatial and/or\ntemporal resolution in quiet regions close to\nthe edge of the solar disk. The radiative transfer calculations have been carried out in given\natmospheric models (see below). Such Q/I signals depend on the anisotropy of the radiation\nfield within the solar atmosphere, which is sensitive to its thermal and density structure. The\n\nConclusion 1 is the most reliable one\nbecause it is based on detailed 3D radiative transfer calculations of the emergent Q/I for the Sr i 4607 \u00c5 line in\na realistic 3D hydrodynamical model of\nthe thermal and density structure of the\nquiet photosphere (Trujillo Bueno et al. 2004;\nTrujillo Bueno & Shchukina 2007). Assuming\nthat the \"hidden\" field of the quiet solar photosphere is randomly oriented below the mean\nfree path of the line-center photons is indeed\na suitable approximation for estimating hBi\n(e.g., Frish et al. 2009). Moreover, calculations\nbased on the assumption that the magnetic field\nis instead horizontal also lead to the conclusion\nof a substantial amount of magnetic energy in\nthe bulk of the quiet solar photosphere (see \u00a74\nin Trujillo Bueno et al. 2006). As reviewed in\nthe just quoted paper several other investigations strongly support this conclusion (see also\nthe very recent contribution by Danilovic et al.\n2010).\n\n\f292\n\nTrujillo Bueno: The Magnetism of the Quiet Solar Chromosphere\n\nConclusions 2 and 3 are based on radiative\ntransfer modeling of the Q/I profile of the H\u03b1\nline observed by Gandorfer (2000) in a quiet\nregion at about 5\u2032\u2032 from the solar limb, using\nvarious (hot and cool) 1D semi-empirical\nmodels. Any such 1D model is certainly a\npoor representation of the chromospheric\nthermal and density conditions. Fortunately,\nthe observed Q/I profile shows a peculiar\nline core asymmetry which is absent in the\nobserved I(\u03bb) profile. Moreover, the Q/I\nprofile of the (photo-ionization dominated)\nH\u03b1 line is not very sensitive to the chromospheric thermal structure. As shown by\n\u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n & Trujillo Bueno (2010b), the line center asymmetry in the observed Q/I profile can\nbe explained by the Hanle effect of a magnetic\nfield in the solar atmosphere whose height\nvariation suggests the presence of an abrupt\nand significant magnetization in the upper\nchromosphere of the quiet Sun and a weakly\nmagnetized plasma directly underneath. Given\nthat the solar chromosphere is devastatingly inhomogeneous and dynamic we cannot exclude\nthe possibility of an alternative explanation.\nNevertheless, there are other spectropolarimetric investigations that favor a sizable\nquiet Sun magnetization at a height of about\n2000 km above the visible solar surface (e.g.,\nTrujillo Bueno et al. 2005; Holzreuter et al.\n2006; Asensio Ramos & Trujillo Bueno 2009;\nCenteno et al. 2010) and a weakly magnetized\nlower chromosphere (Landi Degl'Innocenti\n1998; Belluzzi et al. 2007).\nClearly, understanding the variation with\nheight of the mean magnetization of the quiet\nsolar chromosphere requires taking into account the multi-scale contributions of the\nnetwork and internetwork magnetic loop-like\nstructures.\nAcknowledgements.
