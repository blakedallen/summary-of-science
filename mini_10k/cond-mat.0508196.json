At first, the amount of Na content was\nthought to change the carrier doping level of the CoO2\nplane and to lead to control Tc .7 However, it turned out\nthat such change of the Na content is not a unique parameter for Tc .8 The chemical diversity of the bilayer\nhydrate superconductors was revealed by observations\nof ordering of Na occupied site9 and the transformation\nof intercalated water molecules into oxonium ions at Na\nsites.10 Recently, controlling of the duration in a humidity was found to be effective to control Tc of three-layer\nhydrates.11 This study was a clue for us to control Tc of\nthe bilayer hydrates.\nIn this Letter, we report a successful synthesis of the\nbilayer hydrate Nax CoO2 *yH2 O with sequential Tc 's from\n0 to 4.6 K by controlling duration in a 75 % relative humidity. We found the reproducible non-superconducting\nbilayer hydrate. The systematic change of Tc and also\nthe superconducting volume fraction were confirmed by\nmagnetic susceptibility measurements using a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) magnetometer.\nThe parent compound Na0.7 CoO2 was synthesized\nby so-called \"rapid heating-up\" method.12 Powders of\nCo3 O4 ( 99.9 % ) and Na2 CO3 ( 99.99% ) were ground\nin the mole ratio of 1 : 1.15, put in a pre-heated furnace\nat 750 \u25e6 C, and then kept for 20 hours. The resultant preproducts were again well ground, heated to 800 \u25e6 C for\n8 hours, and kept for 16 hours with flowing oxygen gas.\nAnalysis of powder X-ray diffraction patterns indicates\na single phase of Na0.7 CoO2 .\nThe powder of Na0.7 CoO2 was immersed in 6 M\n\n59\n\narXiv:cond-mat/0508196v1 [cond-mat.supr-con] 8 Aug 2005\n\nNovel phase diagram of superconductor Nax CoO2 * yH2 O\nin a 75 % relative humidity\n\n10\n\n1.2\n\n20\n\n30 40 50 60\n2\u03b8 ( degree )\n\n70\n\nNo.1\n\n80\n\n(b)\n\nNo.4\n\n0.8\nNo.6\n\n0.4\n0.0\n11.5\n\n12.0\n12.5\n13.0\nFrequency ( MHz )\n\n13.5\n\nFig. 1.

At this stage, the obtained powder was characterized to be bilayer hydrated\nNax CoO2 * yH2 O.\nThe obtained Nax CoO2 * yH2 O was kept in a 75 %\nhumidified chamber, and the power of 0.1 g was picked\nout from the chamber day by day, quickly preserved in a\nfreezer at -10 \u25e6 C. As shown below, the physical properties\nof Nax CoO2 * yH2 O depend on this duration (keeping\ntime in the humidified chamber). The cryopreservation in\nthe freezer plays a key role in quenching further change.\nWe prepared eight samples, which duration were 1 to 7\ndays and 1 month. Hereafter, the sample with duration\nof n(= 1, 2, . . . 7, 30 ) days is denoted by No.n.\nFigure 1(a) shows the powder X-ray diffraction patterns of samples No.1, No.4 and No.6 using the Cu K\u03b1\nline at 20 \u25e6 C. From the patterns, each sample was found\nto be in a single phase of bilayer-hydrate. Lattice constants were estimated by using diffractions (002), (004),\n(006), (1\u030412) and (014\u0304).

The peaks correspond to the\nIz = \u00b15/2 \u2194 \u00b17/2 transition lines. In contrast to the\nX-ray diffraction results, an appreciable change was observed in the 59 Co NQR spectra, whose peak frequency\ngradually decreases with increase in the keeping duration. Dashed line in the figure guides the shift of the\npeak. Our samples show systematic increase in Tc with\nincreasing the duration as shown below. Thus, the duration effect results in no appreciable change in the lattice\nconstants but a obvious change in the local charge distribution probed by 59 Co NQR spectra.\nFigure 2 shows the temperature dependence of the\nmagnetic susceptibility \u03c7 for the samples No. 1 \u223c 7 at\n20 Oe and at 1.8 \u223c 5 K.

The data of No.7 and No.30\nare shown by solid line with opened circles and solid line with\nclosed circles, respectively.\n\n1.8 K. Tc of No. 2 \u223c 7 increases with increasing duration.\nDashed arrows indicate the irreversibility temperatures\nTirr 's, which show similar duration dependence to Tc .\nFigure 3 shows the magnetic field dependence of magnetization of the samples No. 1, 4, and 7 at a magnetic\nfield of H \u2264 5 T and at 1.8 K. The slope of the dashed line\nin Fig. 3(a) is the same as an initial slope near zero magnetic field for the sample No. 1, which does not show superconductivity. The nonlinear high field magnetization\nof the sample No. 1 in Fig. 3(a) suggests ferromagnetic\ncorrelation. The another samples show similar behavior\nat a high field. As shown in Fig. 3 (b), the superconducting hysteresis develops from narrow to wide hysteresis\nloops with increasing the duration, being consistent with\nthe behavior of the temperature dependence of \u03c7.\nFigure 4 (a) and (b) show the temperature dependence\nof \u03c7 and the magnetization curves at 1.8 K for the samples No.7 and No.30. Both physical properties show similar in both samples, indicating that the duration effect is\nsmall between 7 and 30 days. Especially, Tc and Tirr are\ninvariant. The irreversibility field Hirr \u223c 2.5 T of No.30\nat 1.8 K, however, is about 6 times larger than Hirr \u223c 0.4\n\nT of No. 7. This result indicates that the vortex pinning\nnumber and the pinning force increase from 7 days to 30\ndays. The upper critical field Hc2 may increase from 7\ndays to 30 days.\nFigure 5 shows the duration dependences of Tc , Tirr\nand relative superconducting volume fraction. The relative volume fraction is normalized by the value of No. 7\nsample. All these values for superconductivity increase as\nduration increases and almost saturate at 7 days. From\nthe NMR and NQR results, the duration effect was found\nto change the local charge distribution around the inplane Co nuclei and the inter-plane correlation.13 The\npresent novel phase diagram of Fig. 5 indicates that the\nsuperconductivity happens through the strong correlation with a delicate difference in the amount of intercalated water molecules.\nIn this study, we found that the non-superconducting\nsample can be obtained by short duration treatment after\nintercalation of water molecules. By a change of the condition, we have already confirmed that a sample does not\nshow superconductivity even at 7 days duration. The duration effect depends on the initial condition of the parent powders ( Na content and the size of the particle )\nand the condition of the humidified chamber ( humidity\nand temperature ). Now the detailed studies of multiplephase diagram on duration effect by controlling the initial condition and the atmosphere in the chamber is in\nprogress.\nWe thank Dr. M. Kato for his helpful discussions. This\nwork was supported in part by Grants-in Aid for Scientific Research from Japan Society for the Promotion of\nScience (16076210).\n\n\f4\n\nJ. Phys. Soc.
