Conversely, even if black holes are not found at the LHC, it is still possible that\nMC \u226b MG and MG \u2243 1 TeV.\nPACS numbers:\n\nIntroduction A most exciting feature of string-inspired\nmodels with large extra dimensions [1, 2] is that the\nfundamental scale of gravity MG could be much smaller\nthan the Planck mass MP \u2243 1016 TeV and as low as\nthe electro-weak scale (MG \u2243 1 TeV). Microscopic black\nholes may therefore be created in our accelerators [3\u20135]\nwith a production cross section given, according to the\n2\nhoop conjecture [6], by \u03c3 \u223c RH\n[4], where RH is the radius of the forming horizon and is bounded below by the\nwavelength of typical quantum fluctuations [7, 8]. After the black hole has formed (and possible transients),\nthe Hawking radiation [9] is expected to set off, with\nthe most common description based on the canonical\nPlanckian distribution for the emitted particles and consequent instantaneous decay [4]. This standard picture\nand a variety of refinements have been implemented in\nthe most recent Monte Carlo codes [10] and the outcome is being confronted with Large Hadron Collider\n(LHC) data [11, 12]. One problem with the canonical description is that the black hole specific heat is in general\nnegative and one should therefore use the more consistent microcanonical description [13, 14], which however\nrequires an explicit counting of the black hole microscopic\ndegrees of freedom (or degeneracy).\nFor this counting, one may appeal to the area law [15],\nfrom which it can be inferred the horizon area describes\nthe black hole degeneracy [16, 17]. The area-entropy correspondence has inspired the holographic principle [18]\nin order to solve the black hole information paradox [19].\nThis principle has widely been developed [20], and a theoretical support was found in the AdS/CFT correspondence [21] that conjectures the equivalence of a string\ntheory with gravity in anti-de Sitter space with a quantum field theory without gravity on the boundary. In this\nletter we shall analyze the interplay between the classicality condition that must be met in black hole formation and the horizon area as a measure of the entropy\n\nof black holes in the brane-world [2]. Our results allow\nfor the existence of \"lightweight\" microscopic black holes\n(LBH) with mass below MG , or could explain the non\nexistence of black holes within the reach of LHC experiments [11, 12] even if MG \u2243 1 TeV.\nCompton classicality A black hole is a classical spacetime configuration and its production in a collider is\ntherefore a \"classicalization\" process in which quantum\nmechanical particles are trapped by gravitational selfinteraction within the horizon [7, 8]. Consequently, quantum fluctuations should be negligible for the final state\n(of total energy M ) which sources such a metric. A\nwidely accepted condition of classicality is then expressed\nby assuming the Compton wavelength \u03bbC \u2243 ~/M =\nlP MP /M 1 of the black hole, viewed as one particle, is\nthe lower bound for the \"would-be horizon radius\" RH ,\nthat is\nRH & \u03bbC ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere RH = RH (M ) depends on the specific black hole\nmetric. In four dimensions, using the Schwarzschild metric, one obtains\nRH = 2 lP\n\nMP\nM\n& lP\nMP\nM\n\n\u21d2\n\nM & MC \u2243 MP , (2)\n\nwhich is supported by perturbative calculations of scattering amplitudes for particles with centre-mass energy\nM [8]. The above derivation does not make full use of the\nspace-time geometry and, in particular, neglects that, for\nM approaching the scale MG , quantum fields should be\naffected by extra-spatial dimensions (if they exist).\n\n1\n\nWe shall mostly use units with the Boltzmann constant kB =\nc = 1, GN = lP /MP and ~ = lP MP = lG MG .\n\n\f2\nEntropic classicality Another classicality argument can\nbe given, which does not involve black hole wavefunctions\nbut relies on Bekenstein's conjectured correspondence between the entropy of thermodynamical systems and the\narea of black hole horizons [16]. Christoudolou [22] first\npointed out that the irreducible mass Mir of a Kerr black\nhole, i.e. the amount of energy that cannot be converted\ninto work by means of the Penrose process\n[23], is related\np\n\u221a\nto the horizon area A as Mir = MP A/16 \u03c0 l2P \u2261 Air .\nNow, in thermodynamics, an increase in entropy is associated with a degradation of energy because the work\nwe can extract from the system is reduced. The similarity is clear, but goes beyond this simple statement.\nFor a Schwarzschild black hole, Mir = M and no energy at all can be extracted. Nonetheless, we can take\na collection of fully degraded subsystems (Schwarzschild\nblack holes) and still get some work out of them. In\nfact, if we merge two or more black holes, the total\nhorizon area must equal at least the sum of all their\noriginal areas [15]. Denoting by Mi and Ai the initial irreducible masses and areas, and by MF and AF\nthe final\narea, we see that\npP mass and\n\u221a irreducible\n\u221a\nP\nP horizon\nA\n=\nMF = AF =\nA\n<\ni\ni\ni Mi . The final\ni\ni\nirreducible mass is then less than the sum of all the initial irreducible masses: some more work can be extracted\nby merging fully degraded black holes. The same occurs\nby collecting thermodynamical systems that \u2013 individually \u2013 are fully degraded but together can still provide\nwork. Bekenstein [16] remarked how we can clarify these\nsimilarities by invoking Shannon's entropy\nX\nS=\u2212\npn ln pn ,\n(3)\n\nFrom Eq. (4), we can now infer an entropic condition\nfor black hole classicality: a four-dimensional classical\nblack hole should have a large degeneracy (in units of\nthe Planck scale), that is\nE\n\u2261\nS\u0303(4)\n\n2\n4 \u03c0 RH\nSBH\n=\n\u2243\nlP MP\n16 \u03c0 l2P\n\n\u0012\n\nM\nMdeg\n\n\u00132\n\n&1,\n\n(5)\n\nwhich, for the Schwarzschild metric, leads to M &\nMdeg \u2243 MP . This conclusion is also supported by perturbative calculations of scattering amplitudes, since the\nentropy (4) can be reproduced by assuming the final classical black holes are composed of quanta with wavelength\n\u03bb \u223c RH [8]. Note, however, that the physical meaning of\nthe two scales is not quite the same: Mdeg is the natural\nunit for measuring black hole internal degrees of freedom\n(like the gap between energy levels of the harmonic oscillator), whereas MC is the minimum mass below which\nblack holes do not exist (like the threshold in massive\nparticle production). That Mdeg \u2243 MC \u2243 MP is expected \u2013 because gravity in four dimensions entails one\nscale \u2013 but is till a remarkable evidence that black holes\nhide most information about forming matter.\nADD black holes Both classicality conditions (2) and (5)\ncan be straightforwardly generalized to models with\nextra-spatial dimensions by replacing MP and lP with\nMG and lG , and using the appropriate expressions for\nthe horizon radius. For example, in the ADD scenario\nof Refs. [1], the brane tension is neglected and one can\ntherefore consider vacuum solutions to the Einstein equations in 4 + d dimensions to derive the following relation\nbetween the mass and horizon radius [4],\n\nn\n\nwhere pn is the probability for a thermodynamical system to be found in the n-th state. A thermodynamical system is described in terms of a few macroscopical\nvariables (like energy, temperature and pressure). Once\nthese variables are fixed, the system can however be described by a huge amount of microscopically inequivalent\nstates. Hence, entropy can be seen as the lack of information about the actual internal structure of the system.\nAnalogously, any four-dimensional black hole can be described in terms of three macroscopic variables: mass,\nangular momentum and charge. All information about\nthe matter which formed the black hole is lost beyond\nthe horizon. Because of properties shared by thermodynamical entropy and horizon area, Bekenstein found the\nsimplest expression (with dimensions of ~) which satisfies\nthe conditions on the irreducible mass is\nSBH\n\nMP A\n=\n.\n16 \u03c0 lP\n\n(4)\n\nUsing a gedanken experiment , Bekenstein [24] further obtained the so-called entropy bound SBH \u2264 2 \u03c0 RH M , and\nthis topic has by now been extended to more general scenarios (for a review, see Ref. [25]).\n\nlG\nRH = \u221a\n\u03c0\n\n\u0012\n\nM\nMG\n\n1\n\u0013 1+d\n\n8 \u0393 d+3\n2\n2+d\n\n1\n\u0001 ! 1+d\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u0393 is the usual Gamma function. Inserting the\nabove into Eq. (1) yields 2\nRH & lG\n\nMG\nM\n\nM & MC \u2243 MG ,\n\n\u21d2\n\n(7)\n\nas one would naively expect. Moreover, the same result\nis again obtained by generalizing the entropic argument\nto 4 + d dimensions, namely\nE\n\u2243\nS\u0303(4+d)\n\n\u0012\n\nRH\nlG\n\n\u00132+d\n\n\u223c\n\n\u0012\n\nM\nMdeg\n\n\u0013 2+d\n1+d\n\n&1,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere Mdeg \u2243 MG . One therefore concludes that even in\nthe ADD scenario, gravity enters black hole physics with\none scale, MG , like in four dimensions.\n\n2\n\nThis is the kind of condition employed in all Monte Carlo studies\nof black hole production at the LHC [10].\n\n\f3\nBrane-world black holes The situation appears more involved in the brane-world (RS) scenario [2], in which the\nbrane tension is not ignored and the bulk is consequently\nwarped. This has made it very hard to describe black\nholes [26] 3 , and only a few analytical candidates are\nknown which solve the effective four-dimensional vacuum\nEinstein equations [28],\nR\u03bc\u03bd \u2212\n\n1\nR g\u03bc\u03bd = E\u03bc\u03bd\n2\n\n\u21d2\n\nR=0,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere the presence of tidal effects from the propagation\nof gravity into the bulk is represented by the (traceless)\nprojected Weyl tensor E\u03bc\u03bd . One of these solutions is the\ntidally charged metric [29]\n\u0001\nds2 = \u2212A dt2 + A\u22121 dr2 + r2 d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 , (10)\nwith\n\n2 lP M\nl2\nA=1\u2212\n\u2212 q G2 ,\nMP r\nr\n\n(11)\n\nwhich has been extensively studied in Refs. [14, 30\u201332].\nIn the above and what follows, the tidal charge q and M\nare treated as independent quantities, although one expects q vanishes when the black hole mass M = 0. Further, we only consider the case q > 0 since negative tidal\ncharge would yield anti-gravity effects [31]. A relation\nq = q(M ) should be obtained by solving the complete\nfive-dimensional Einstein equations [32] (or by means of\nsupplementary arguments [33]). Nevertheless, since we\nare here interested in black holes near their minimum\npossible mass MC \u223c MG \u226a MP , we can approximate\nq \u2243 q(MC ) and constant, and expand all final expressions for M \u223c MG \u226a MP .\nWe can first apply the usual classicality argument (1),\nwith the horizon radius\ns\n!\nMP2\nM\nM2\nRH = lP\n,\n(12)\n+\n+q 2\nMP\nMP2\nMG\nand obtain M & MC , where the minimum mass\nMG\nMC \u2243 \u221a ,\nq\n\n(13)\n\nfor M \u223c MG \u226a MP .\nWe can also repeat the entropic argument by employing the effective four-dimensional action, namely\nE\nS\u0303eff\n\u2243\n\n3\n\n2\n4 \u03c0 RH\n,\n16 \u03c0 l2P\n\n(14)\n\nArguments have been formulated against the existence of static\nbrane-world black hole metrics [27]. Given the Hawking radiation is likely a strong effect for microscopic black holes, their\ninstability is here taken as granted.\n\nwhich, however, is not at a minimum for M \u2243 MC , as\none would instead expect from previous cases. This discrepancy can be cured by recalling the Euclidean action\n(as well as the thermodynamical entropy) is defined modulo constant terms, which, for example, do not affect the\nvalue of the Hawking temperature nor the microcanonical\ndescription of the Hawking radiation [13]. By subtracting\nfrom Eq. (14) a suitable constant, namely\nE\nE\nE\nS\u0303sub\n= S\u0303eff\n(M ) \u2212 S\u0303eff\n(MC ) ,\n\n(15)\n\nand expanding for M \u223c MG \u226a MP , we finally obtain\nE\nS\u0303sub\n\u2243\n\nM\n,\nMdeg\n\n(16)\n\nwhere there now appears the effective degeneracy scale\nMG\nMdeg \u2243 \u221a .\nq\n\n(17)\n\nIt is again remarkable that Mdeg \u2243 MC and brane-world\nblack holes are also described by one scale [recall that\nq \u2243 q(MC ) is not truly independent]. The \"natural\"\nchoice would now be q \u2243 1, so that Mdeg \u2243 MC \u2243 MG ,\nbut the effective scale Mdeg \u2243 MC could also be either\nlarger (q \u226a 1) or smaller (q \u226b 1) than MG .\nConcluding remarks Detection of black holes at the LHC\nwould be a clear signal that we are embedded in a\nhigher-dimensional space-time and the fundamental scale\nof gravity MG \u2243 1 TeV. The existence of extra spatial\ndimensions could also be uncovered by means of particle processes which involve the exchange of bulk gravitons [35]. Such processes are perturbatively described\nby operators suppressed by inverse powers of MG , and\nmight not be detectable if the latter is larger than a few\nTeV [36]. We have shown that both classicality conditions, from quantum mechanics and the entropic counting of internal degrees of freedom, allow for brane-world\nblack holes with minimum mass (13). The latter might\nbe different from the fundamental scale MG , if q departs\nsignificantly from 1 (which should be related to details of\nthe mechanism confining standard model particles and\nfour-dimensional modes of gravity on the brane). This\nintroduces two alternative scenarios:\ni) for q \u226b 1, \"lightweight black holes\" (LBH) with MC .\nM . MG may exist and be produced at the LHC even\nif MG & 10 TeV. In this case, the effects due to bulk\ngraviton exchanges would remain undetected;\nii) if q \u226a 1, black holes do not exist with M \u2243 MG , even\nif MG \u2243 1 TeV, and processes involving bulk gravitons\nare the only available signature of extra-spatial dimensions.\nThe former scenario might have important phenomenological implications both for accelerator physics\nand in astrophysics. Although recent LHC data at 7 TeV\ncenter mass energy seem to exclude the production of\n\n\f4\nmicroscopic black holes [11, 12], there is still the possibility that future runs at 14 TeV will achieve this goal.\nFurther, LHB might play a role in cosmological models\nas primordial black holes produced in the early universe,\nand in astrophysics as the outcome of high energy cosmic\nrays colliding against dense stars [37].\nThe case of q \u226a 1 might instead explain why there is\nno evidence of black holes at the LHC [11, 12], even if\nextra-spatial dimensions exist.\nWe would like to thank B.
