Galaxies: active \u2013 Plasmas\n\n1. Introduction\nBlazars, a sub-class of active galactic nuclei (AGN), are\namong the strongest known radiation sources in the universe.\nObservations show that they exhibit strong optical polarization, variability on all observable timescales, flat-spectrum\nradio emission from a compact core, and many of them\nemit the bulk of their luminosity in the form of \u03b3-rays (e.g.\nDermer & Gehrels 1995; Mukherjee et al. 1997). On account\nof these measurements it is usually argued that the \u03b3-rays are\nproduced in very compact regions within a relativistically moving system, the so-called jets, thus providing a strong Doppler\namplification of the radiation. Often, the relativistic bulk motion can be directly observed as apparent superluminal motion\nof individual emission regions in the jets in sequences of VLBI\nobservations of their radio emission. The Lorentz factors (and\nDoppler factors) thus derived are of the order of ten for general samples of AGNs (Vermeulen & Cohen 1994), but may be\nhigher for AGNs showing prominent gamma-ray emission (e.g.\nHoman et al. 2002, 2003). The range of Lorentz factors prevalent at the time of gamma-ray emission, which presumably occurs before the emission region becomes visible at radio frequencies, is not known, but is likely higher than ten, if the bulk\nkinetic energy of the jets is the energy reservoir for the particle acceleration (see, e.g., Georganopoulos & Kazanas 2003).\nThese conclusions are further supported by the absence of \u03b3 \u2212\u03b3\nSend offprint requests to: M. Siewert, e-mail:ms@tp4.rub.de\n\npair absorption and the violation of the Elliot-Shapiro relation\n(Elliot & Shapiro 1974) in several observed AGNs.\nThe unified model for active galaxies (Urry & Padovani\n1995) assumes that a supermassive black hole is located in\nthe center of a galaxy. The black hole supposedly accelerates\nplasma to high energies, while the surrounding host galaxy provides a steady inflow of matter, often assumed to be in the form\nof an accretion disk, to keep the system running for a long time.\nAbove the accretion disk plasma is ejected in jets, which may\nreach lengths of several hundreds kpc (Begelman et al. 1984;\nSchlickeiser 2002).\nThough thermal radiation can be observed from many\nAGN, it is usually associated with the accretion disk and the\nmedium around it. The emission from the jets is generally assumed to be entirely non-thermal on account of the spectrum\nand the variability behaviour. Nevertheless, there may be thermal plasma in the jets, in which the dominantly radiating, energetic particles are embedded and confined.\nIn this paper we will study the effect of thermal matter in\nthe jets on the low-frequency non-thermal emission and the\nvariability thereof. We will do so in the framework of one\nparticular model of particle acceleration, in which the energetic particles are provided by the isotropization of interstellar matter in the downstream region of a relativistic collision\nfront (Pohl & Schlickeiser 2000, henceforth referred to as PS),\nthough most of our treatment, and hence most of the results,\nare not restricted to the particulars of this scenario.\n\n\f2\n\nM. Siewert et al.: The impact of thermal gas in AGN jets on the low-frequency emission\n\nAs we will see, the thermal gas will not necessarily manifest itself by its emission, but rather by its absorption. Both the\nemission and the absorption properties of thermal matter depend strongly on the temperature, and thus the problem at hand\nhas two aspects. First, the radiation transport of low-frequency\nemission through thermal gas must be calculated, which is a\nfunction of the plasma temperature and density as well as of\nthe spectrum of energetic particles. We then need to follow the\ntemperature evolution of the thermal gas, which depends on the\nits emission and absorptions coefficients (and hence on its temperature), on the spectrum of energetic particles, and on possible wave damping. In this study we concentrate on continuum\nemission processes.\nThe spectrum of non-thermal particles obviously varies\nwith time on account of the variability in the high-energy emission. Consequently the plasma temperature will vary, and so\nwill the thermal absorption coefficient. The observable flux of\nlow-frequency emission is thus modulated by the temperature\nevolution of the thermal gas, and it can therefore display very\ncomplicated variability behaviour, the study of which is the\nsubject of this paper.\nWe first give a brief introduction into the PS model for active galactic nuclei (Sect. 2). After this, in Sect. 3 we discuss\nthe radiation transport for a general non-thermal population of\nelectrons in a warm electron-proton plasma. We present numerical absorption and emission coefficients for a generic situation\n(when this is possible) as well as for the PS model (when a\ngeneric treatment is not possible). In Sect. 5 we discuss the\ntemperature evolution in a generic warm background plasma\nfor different heating processes. The results of this analysis are\nindependent of the non-thermal particle spectrum, so that they\ncan easily be applied to other (non-)astrophysical situations.\nIn Sect. 4 and 5.5 we present numerical results for the PS\nmodel and demonstrate that only a few parameters actually influence the qualitative behaviour of a system. Section 5.5 emphasizes the limits of our calculations, while Sect. 6 connects\nthese limits to free parameters in this situation.\n\nlab system\n\n\u0393\n\nn*p\n\nn*i\n\njet system\n\u0393\n\nni\n\n\u03b8\n\nnp\n\n2r\n\n\u0393\n\u0393\n\nd\nFig. 1. The geometry visualized for two systems of reference,\nthe jet frame and the laboratory (host galaxy) frame, for which\nall quantities are indexed with an asterisk. We consider a single\ncloud of thermal proton-electron plasma with density np , that is\nrelativistically moving through the interstellar medium of the\nhost galaxy with density n\u2217i . An observer would see radiation\nfrom the plasma cloud that is emitted at an angle \u03b8 with respect\nto its direction of motion.\n\n2. The basic model\nPohl & Schlickeiser (2000) have studied the kinetic relaxation\nof particles that have traversed a parallel collision front from\nthe upstream to the downstream region. This pick-up process\noccurs due to scattering off low-wavenumber plasma waves\nthat the picked-up particles generate through streaming instabilities. The calculation describes the first half-cycle of the\nstandard shock acceleration process for relativistic, collisionless flows. If the outflow plasma propagating through the jet\nis dense, the downstream region provides a target for the\nultra-relativistic protons to interact with and produce radiation through various leptonic and hadronic emission channels.\nThe predicted radiation properties resemble those of gammaray blazars and thus the model offers an attractive alternative to shock acceleration of electrons and subsequent Inverse\nCompton scattering.\nThe geometry of the system is shown in Fig. 1 for two systems of reference, the jet frame (without index) and the laboratory (host galaxy) frame, for which all quantities are indexed\n\nwith an asterisk. In this report, we also use a third reference\nframe, the observer frame, which we use to calculate the observed evolution time. We will come back to this point later in\nthis section. We consider the jet to consist of individual clouds\nof thermal proton-electron plasma, that are relativistically moving through the interstellar medium of the host galaxy. Here we\ndiscuss the interactions of one such cloud with temperature T ,\ndensity np , and as a simple approximation for its spatial extent\nand form a cylindrical disk with radius r and thickness d. We\nemphasize that we treat the swept-up matter as a simple collection of particles, which is in accordance with the earlier model\nby Pohl & Schlickeiser (2000), and unlike the fluid treatment\ncommon to shock acceleration physics (Schlickeiser 2002). As\na consequence, there is no relation between the two quantities\nn p and ni , and the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions do not apply.\nThe Lorentz transformation between the two frames of reference gives the relations ni = \u0393n\u2217i and n\u2217p = \u0393np with a relative\nLorentz factor of \u0393. The swept-up particles are of high energies\n\n\fM. Siewert et al.: The impact of thermal gas in AGN jets on the low-frequency emission\n\nin the instantaneous downstream (jet) frame and are quickly\nisotropized (Pohl & Schlickeiser 2000). Momentum conservation causes the system to decelerate, while internal processes\nproduce a broad distribution of primary protons, Np (\u03b3p ), and\nsecondary electrons, Ne (\u03b3e ), which are more important than\nprimary electrons for the parameters of interest. Unless noted\notherwise, all relevant expressions use cgs units, all particle\nspectra Nx are taken per unit volume and all equations and formulae are taken in the instantaneous jet frame.\nThe isotropization of the swept-up particles effects a momentum transfer from the interstellar medium particles to the\njet. Therefore, the jet decelerates and the Lorentz factor of\nthe jet, \u0393, is a function of time. It follows the equations\n(Pohl & Schlickeiser 2000)\n\u0393\u0307 = \u2212\nM(t) = V\n\n\u03c0r2 n\u2217i cmp\nM(t)\nXZ \u221e\n\nx=e,p\n\n(\u03932 \u2212 1)3/2\n\n(1)\n\nd\u03b3 mx (nb + \u03b3 Nx (\u03b3, t))\n\n(2)\n\n1\n\nwhere M(t) is the total mass of the compact plasma, which in\nturn depends on the differential number density of the energetic particles, N(\u03b3). Such gradual deceleration has been directly observed in the case of the micro-quasar XTE J1550-564\n(Corbel et al. 2002).\nThe Lorentz factors observed in astrophysical sources vary\ngreatly depending on the source class and the measured velocity indicator. While in gamma-ray burst (GRBs) they may reach\nvalues of several hundreds, the Lorentz factors in AGN jets are\nusually only of the order of ten, if deduced from measurements\nof superluminal motion, but may be higher for \u03b3-ray-bright\nblazars. For TeV-blazars the radiation modeling often also requires significantly higher Lorentz (and Doppler) factors (e.g.\nKonopelko et al. 2003). However, gamma-ray emission is presumed to occur before the emission zone becomes visible at\nradio frequencies, and the corresponding Lorentz factor should\nthus be very much higher than ten, if the bulk kinetic energy\nof the jets is supposed to be the source for particle acceleration. Additionally, the physics of jet formation, and therefore\nthe Lorentz factors involved with this process are not understood, but considering the supposedly extreme conditions near\na black hole, it is highly possible that the particles which are\nultimately injected into the jet initially possess similarly high\nvelocities. For this reason, we assume an initial Lorentz factor\n\u03930 = 300. We would like to point out that our results are only\nparametrically dependent on this choice.\nIn the instantaneous jet frame the differential number density of protons and electrons follows the evolution equation\nN(\u03b3)\n\u2202\n\u2202N\n(\u03b3\u0307N(\u03b3)) \u2212\n= \u1e44 \u2212\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03b3\nTc\n\n(3)\n\nwhere T c is the timescale for particle losses by escape or decay,\n\u03b3\u0307 represents continuous energy losses, and \u1e44 is the injection or\nproduction rate of new particles. As initial condition at the time\nt = 0, when the jet Lorentz factor is \u0393 = \u03930 , we assume that\nthere are no energetic particles in the jet, N(\u03b3) = 0.\nIn the default configuration the background plasma sweeps\nup protons from the interstellar matter, while electrons are\n\n3\n\nproduced in inelastic collisions in the system.

For the relation between the observer angle and the\nemission angle see Eq.17 and 18.\n\nAs a reminder we here list the relations between relevant\nquantities in the observer's frame and the jet frame. While the\nobserver's frame is fixed, the jet frame is only the instantaneous\nrest frame of the jet plasma at the time considered. Since we are\ninterested in the long-time evolution of a compact relativistic\nobject moving along a straight line under a fixed aspect angle\nin the observer's frame, we also need to consider that the corresponding aspect angle in the instantaneous jet frame is not\nconstant, for the Doppler factor is changing with time.\ncos \u03b8obs =\ncos \u03b8 =\n\nHere the subscripts el and inel stand for elastic and inelastic processes, S ync for synchrotron radiation and Brems for\nBremsstrahlung. The equations 12 and 13 are taken from Haug\n(1988), eq. 18, assuming a Coulomb logarithm of 25 and neglecting the last terms. This modification has been made to be\nconsistent with eq. 44, while in Pohl & Schlickeiser (2000) a\nvalue of 20 is used. It does not affect the overall results in any\nvisible way. Equation 15 is from Pacholczyk (1970), averaged\nover all emission directions. The inelastic energy losses, eq.\n14 are a result of the model used to evaluate these processes\n(Capella et al. 1994). Finally, the Bremsstrahlung energy losses\nare taken from Hayakawa (1969) and Pohl & Schlickeiser\n(2000).\nThe timescales for particle losses are from\nJauch & Rohrlich (1976) (eq. 10) and Pohl & Schlickeiser\n(2000) (eq. 8 and 9). The diffusive escape timescale used here\nis derived for the disk geometry under the condition r \u226b d,\nwhich implies that effectively the charged particles will only\nescape through the top and bottom surfaces. The most important point here is the assumption that the energetic particles\nstart diffusing outwards near the center of the jet plasma cloud.\nDepending on the Alfv\u00e9n speed and the initial intensity of\nscattering waves this may be questionable (Vainio et al. 2004).\nWe also want to emphasize that these equations have been\nderived under the assumption that the plasma is fully ionized\nand that the particle number is conserved. If this is not the\ncase, the above equations have to be modified for ionization,\nrecombination and pair production.\nThe free parameters of the model are specified in table 1\nfor a quick reference, where we also show the numerical values we have adopted as standard set of parameters in this paper.\nWhenever we modify one of these values, it is explicitely mentioned in the text. We have neglected all e+ e\u2212 annihilation processes, since we focus on the optical-to-infrared region where\npair annihilation does not contribute.\nAll calculations in this analysis are made in the jet rest\nframe. For a comparison with observations, the photon spectra have to be transformed into the observer's frame, which,\ndepending on the cosmological redshift of the AGN in question, can be different from the host galaxy frame. For ease of\nexposition we will assume in the following treatment that the\nobserver's frame and the host galaxy frame are identical, as was\ndone in Pohl & Schlickeiser (2000).\n\nD =\n\u03bdobs =\nI obs (\u03bdobs ) =\n\ncos \u03b8 + \u03b2\u0393\n1 + \u03b2\u0393 cos \u03b8\ncos \u03b8obs \u2212 \u03b2\u0393\n1 \u2212 \u03b2\u0393 cos \u03b8obs\n1\n\u0393(1 \u2212 \u03b2\u0393 cos \u03b8obs )\nD\u03bd\nD3 I(\u03bdobs /D)\n\ndtobs = dt/D\n\n(17)\n(18)\n(19)\n(20)\n(21)\n(22)\n\n3.

The synchrotron coefficients are\nbased on the numerically derived electron spectrum in the system after one hour of observed time, while the free-free radiation coefficients depend only on the temperature, which is approximately 3*104 K at this time. The kinematic of the pion and\nmuon decays is unfavorable for the production of secondary\nelectrons with an energy less than approximately 100 MeV.\nThus, essentially only highly relativistic electron are generated.\nThe energy loss rate below 300 MeV is dominated by Coulomb\nand ionization interactions, i.e. is independent of energy, so that\nin a steady-state spectrum the cooling tail towards lower energies would be flat. The synchrotron spectrum in Fig. 3 is correspondingly inverted.\nThe non-thermal emission spectra do not significantly\nchange when we modify the parameters, except for an approximately linear dependence on the density of the interstellar\n\nmedium, so the results displayed here are a good estimate in\nmost situations. The free-free absorption, and to a smaller extent the emission, is strongly reduced in efficiency for higher\ntemperatures. As we shall see later, the plasma temperature\ncan rise from T = 3 * 104 K, which nearly is a lower limit,\nto 109 K or more. Modifying the temperature from 3 * 104 K\nto this value reduces the absorption coefficient by 7 orders of\nmagnitude, which makes the free-free absorption less efficient\nthan the synchrotron absorption. The temperature, for which\nboth are approximately equal, is around 108 K.\nIt thus appears that the optical thickness is mostly dominated by free-free absorption, while the emission is dominated\nby either synchrotron radiation or bremsstrahlung, depending\non the frequency. It is important to include the Razin effect in\nour calculations, for, without the Razin effect, the synchrotron\nemission coefficient would not have a cut-off at low frequencies, and free-free emission would be completely negligible.\nAn interesting possibility is that a synchrotron maser may\noperate in the jet plasma. Maser activity requires a negative\nabsorption coefficient (\u03b1 < 0), indicating that stimulated emission is more important than the spontaneous absorption. If the\noptical depth \u03c4 \u226a \u22121, the emitted photon intensity can be very\nhigh.\nCrusius & Schlickeiser (1988) have shown that for the synchrotron process this is only possible when the electron spectrum has a slope of at least 2, i.e. the distribution function is\ninverted. The numerical calculations of the inelastic proton decay chain seem to indicate that this is not the case, at least\nin the energy regions covered in this report. The condition for\nsynchrotron masering is \u03b1 < 0, and since the evaluation of \u03b1\nrequires an integration over the entire radiating particle distribution (eq. 37), this condition must be valid for a large energy\ninterval, and a locally hard spectrum will not be sufficient for a\nmaser to operate.\n\n4. Simple photon spectra\nIn this section we discuss radiation spectra for a constant temperature with a view to understand the characteristic properties\nof the escaping low-frequency emission. After one hour of observed time, the temperature is T \u2248 3 * 104 K.\nPhoton spectra calculated on the basis of the exact disk geometry are presented in Fig. 4. The spectrum can be separated\nin an optically thick region and an optically thin region. The optical depth itself is dominated by the free-free absorption process. The emission process is dominated by the synchrotron\nprocess, for which the Razin effect causes a drop off below a\ncertain photon energy, so that at very low frequencies the freefree emission becomes visible.\nThe spectra shown here are calculated in the jet frame, and\nthus they need to be transformed in the observer system for a\ncomparison with data. For blazars, this would result in a frequency shift by about two orders of magnitude, so the turnover frequency, at which the emission transitions from optically thick to optically thin conditions, would be located in the\nnear-infrared.\nNext, we calculate the emitted photon spectra for different\nobservation angles \u03b8obs and show typical results in Fig.5.

The evolution of the temperature\nThroughout this paper we have assumed that LTE is valid, that\nthe jet plasma is always non-relativistic, and that the electron\nand proton components have the same temperature, i.e. the\ninternal equilibration processes are faster than the energy exchange with the environment.\n\n5.1. The cooling process\nAs we have seen, the temperature of the jet plasma is a decisive parameter for the radiation yield at low frequencies.\nThe plasma is subjected to a number of heating and cooling\nprocesses, and therefore the temperature will not remain constant. We use a balance equation to follow the variations of the\nplasma temperature,\n\u1e6a =\n\n1\n(\u03b3 \u2212 1)(\u01eb\u0307 \u2212 \u039b) ,\nnp k\n\n1e-21\n1e-22\n\u039b/np2 [erg cm3/s]\n\nvery small aspect angles \u03b8obs \u2264 1\u25e6 , the jet system appears to\nrapidly evolve; in fact \u0393 \u2248 270 after one hour of observed time.\nThis value is still very high compared to typical Lorentz factors\nof 10, but one should note that it takes months for an outburst to\nbecome visible at radio frequencies, where most measurement\nof jet velocity are made.\nThe characteristic aspect of these spectra is the presence of\nboth the thermal and the synchrotron components of the spectrum. Variations on the high-frequency part of the spectrum,\nmost notably a shift of the turn-over frequency, are visible,\nwhich result from the different aspect in the jet frame, i.e. the\ndifferent optical depth for a frontal and side view of the emission region in the jet frame.\nFor larger observation angles (\u03b8obs > 1\u25e6 ), the system\nevolves much slower, so that \u0393 \u2248 \u03930 after a single hour.\n\n1e-23\n1e-24\n1e-25\n1e-26\n1e-27\n100\n\n1000\n\n10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08\nT [K]\n\nFig. 6.

The balance of heating and cooling\nThe evolution of the temperature is closely tied to the evolution of the heating and cooling rates. For a homogeneous interstellar medium the system will tend to attain a quasi-steady\nstate. Consequently, the heating rates rise with time until they\nreach an asymptotic value. The temperature then evolves until\nthe cooling balances the heating.\nThe cooling rate is a strong function of the temperature,\nwith a huge jump at 104 K as the dominating feature at low temperatures (see fig.6). To reach higher temperatures, the heating\nrate must be large enough to compensate the hydrogen cooling, or the system will stay at 104 K, where the ionization fraction of hydrogen may be low, which results in an even lower\nturn-over frequency, so that the entire emission may be optical thin. Additionally, it is likely that under the conditions prevailent in the jet plasma, the temperature dependence of the\nionization fraction is weaker than in the LTE calculations of\nDalgarno & McCray (1972) and Raymond et al. (1976), thus\ncausing a slower rise of the cooling curve. Nevertheless, the\nsystem will have a stable region around 104 K for a wide range\nof heating rates.\nWhen the heating rate becomes larger than the maximum\nof the cooling function at 105 K, the temperature will increase\nto more than 108 K, beyond which bremsstrahlung cooling may\nagain balance the heating. Extrapolating the cooling function to\ntemperature T & 108 K is problematic, though, for one quickly\narrives at relativistic temperatures, kT & me c2 , at which most\nof our assumptions and formulae are no longer valid. At these\ntemperatures, it is especially required to include pair production into our equations, which increases the particle number\nin the background plasma while reducing the amount of energy\navailable for the individual particle, thus efficiently limiting the\ntemperature of the system. In addition, the concept of a stable\nisotropic Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is not well justified\nin these regions (Stepney 1982).\nFor the standard parameters (see table 1), this overheating does not happen (see fig. 7), while for n\u2217i = 0.8 cm\u22123 the\nheating processes are too strong to keep the temperature nonrelativistic. The Fig. also demonstrates that the synchrotron\ncontribution to the heating rate is quite small; numerical evaluations show that this process contributes about 10 % of the\nCoulomb heating rate, which is in good agreement with our\nestimate in the preceding section. Finally, the asymptotic cooling is a direct result of the deceleration of the system, which\ndecreases the number of swept up particles (eq. 4). At t = 0,\nwhen there are no non-thermal particles present, the heating\n\n20000\n10000\n0\n\n5000\n\n10000\ntobs [s]\n\n15000\n\n20000\n\nFig. 7.

It is possible to prevent this with a careful\nchoice of initial parameters, which results in stable temperatures of T = 108 K.\n\n6. Results\n\n6.1. Modifying the initial parameters\nIn the last sections we have seen that the temperature of the\nbackground plasma can be used to estimate the stability of our\nmodel. For this reason, we have made a parameter study to\napproximate the regions in which we get reliable results. We\nhave discovered four different regions: cold (T \u2264 104 K), warm\n(104 K\u2264 T \u2264 105 K), hot (108 K\u2264 T \u2264 109 K) and forbidden\n(T > 109 K). The region between 105 K and 108 K is unstable,\nwhich is a result of the specific form of the cooling function.\nThe region between 108 and 109 K is stable only for very specific initial parameters, as outlined in the last section.\nThe particle number densities np and n\u2217i strongly dominate\nthe system; the different regions in the np \u2212n\u2217i -plane for the standard parameters (see table 1) are displayed in Fig.8. Another\nparameter which determines the temperature evolution is the\nsize of the system. It turns out that on account of the particle number sweep-up rate (eq.4), which is proportional to the\nsweep-up surface divided by the total volume of the system,\nonly one of the size parameters really contributes to this point,\nwhich can be identified as the average optical path for a generic\nsystem. For the specific disk geometry, this parameter is identical to the thickness d; then for the standard parameters the\nboundary points are\ndcold\u2212warm \u2248 2.1 * 1013 cm\ndwarm\u2212hot \u2248 4.1 * 1013 cm\n\n(56)\n(57)\n\nSince the secondary electrons dominate the heating process\n(see Sect. 5.2), and their production rate can not be treated analytically, these results can not be derived from Fig. 8.\n\n\f10\n\nM.

The dotted lines are for \u03930 = 600.\n\nwith a \u226b b and c the fraction of the period where the heating is strong. We have normalized these parameters in a way\nthat the interstellar matter density averaged over a period is\nn\u2217i . Under this periodically peaked scheme, it is again easier\nto keep the system stable at 108 K without causing overheating\nas described in chapter 5.5.\n\n6.3. Light curves and correlations\nThe initial Lorentz factor \u0393(t = 0) modifies the interstellar\nmatter density in the jet frame, ni = \u0393(t)n\u2217i . This in turn modifies the number of particles in the system and therefore the\nheating rate by elastic scattering. However, it does not modify\nthe form of the boundaries of temperature regions in the np \u2212n\u2217i plane, but only their location. To demonstrate this, in fig. 8 we\nalso display the temperature regions for \u03930 = 600.\nThe observer angle \u03b8obs only modifies the observed time required for the system to evolve, so the asymptotic behaviour\nremains unchanged. The magnetic field strength B has practically no influence on the temperature, since the synchrotron\nheating process is negligible.\nAs mentioned earlier, by modifying the initial temperature\nT 0 together with the interstellar matter density n\u2217i , we are able\nto establish stable 'hot' temperatures. In most cases, however,\nthe initial temperature will not modify the system.\nFrom this we conclude that our model is stable only on a\nrather small region in the initial parameter space. In this case,\nthere are three asymptotically stable temperature regions, and\nit may be possible to fix some of these parameters by observations. In all other cases, the initial assumption of a nonrelativistic thermal component in the jets breaks down, although the sweep-up mechanism itself remains valid.\n\n6.2. Time-dependent variations of free parameters\nIn a real situation the extragalactical matter density n\u2217i is not\nconstant over long timescales and distances. The plasma in the\njet may cross dense clouds of hydrogen or enter a local fluctuation. For this reason we have investigated the temperature evolution under some simple modifications of our sweep-up rate.\nFirst, we have considered a simple step in the ambient matter density,\n\u1e44cld = \u1e44(1 + a\u0398(t1 \u2212 t)).\n\n(58)\n\nSuch a situation may possibly be found when the jet leaves the\nimmediate host galaxy and enter the intergalactic medium. In\nthis case it is slightly easier to produce stable temperatures at\n\nWe have then calculated light curves for several different energies, which we present in Fig. 9 for the periodically peaked\ninjection and the standard parameters. Unlike the other photon\nspectra presented in this report, these curves are taken in the\nobserver frame, in which, on account of the deceleration of the\njet, the frequency corresponding to a fixed jet-frame frequency\nvaries with time, although the modification usually is small.\nWe see that the variability is visible, but that the average\nbehaviour of the system remains unchanged. Additionally, the\nvariability only affects the optical thick region, which is a result\nof temperature variations. In the optical thick region, we have\nI \u221d j/\u03b1 (eq. 25) and \u03b1 \u2248 \u03b1thermal , which in turn causes F\u03bd to depend on the temperature. Since the heating rate is proportional\nto the total number of energetic particles, a sudden increase in\nthis number causes a similar modification of the temperature of\nthe jet plasma, which again modifies the optical thick emission.\nBecause of j \u2248 jsy , the optical thin emission (see eq. 25) does\nnot demonstrate a similar behaviour. For this reason our model\nis able to reproduce different variability in different freqnency\nbands.\nNext, we have calculated correlation coefficients for this injection profile, using light curves in the observer frame between\nthe infrared, optical and ultraviolet, from the plasma frequency\nup to a few 10 eV, with small and large distances between the\nconsidered frequencies.\nIt turns out that the lightcurves at different frequencies are\nalmost perfectly correlated (> 0.9), even if we compare freefree-dominated with synchrotron-dominated parts of the spectrum. To understand this behaviour, we first note that the electron distribution is dominated by the diffusive escape process\n(eq. 8), while the continuous losses are too inefficient. For\nhigh-energy electrons the particle spectrum is exclusively determined by the Lorentz factor of the jet, \u0393. For this reason\nall light curves produced by the electrons are highly correlated\nwith each other, even between the free-free and synchrotron\nprocesses, since the free-free emission depends on the temperature, which again is determined by the high-energy electrons,\nsimilar to the synchrotron emission. Given that the optically\n\n\fM. Siewert et al.: The impact of thermal gas in AGN jets on the low-frequency emission\n\n7.2.

Significant variations occur exclusively in the optical\nthick regime; the redshift of the source has been set to z = 0.5.\n\nthin synchrotron emission shows only a very weak response to\nthe variations in the injection rate, most of the correlation signal is presumably caused by the common secular trend in all\nlight curves that is caused by the deceleration of the jet.\n\n7. Possible corrections\nIn this section we briefly discuss possible further aspects of the\nproblems investigated in this paper.\n\n7.1. The electrostatic instability\nRecently, Pohl et al. (2002) have investigated the electrostatic\ninstability in a relativistic beam of electrons and protons and\nits impact on our model. Their conclusion was that the sweepup spectrum effectively gets modified from a peak structure at\n\u03b3 = \u0393 to a plateau distribution up to \u03b3 = \u0393, while keeping the\nnumber of collected particles and the low-energy photon spectrum unchanged. The energy lost in this process may contribute\nto the heating of the background plasma, but there is no reliable\nestimate available of the exact amount of energy transferred.\nObservations hint that only a tiny fraction of the total energy\nlost by this mechanism can ever contribute to the heating.\nSince this process in principle involves a huge amount of\nenergy, it might dramatically change the evolution of the temperature. However, Pohl et al. (2002) have only considered the\ninitial situation of a cold electron-proton beam penetrating cold\nthermal plasma. The presence of isotropic energetic particles\nshould strongly reduce the growth rate of electrostatic turbulence, so that at least in a quasi-steady state heating by damping of electrostatic waves should be much less severe than suggested by the asymptotic energy loss of the incoming particle\nbeam.\n\nCurrently, our initial conditions assume that there are no nonthermal particles present. Although the mechanism responsible for creation and stability of the jets is not completely understood (Urry & Padovani 1995; Begelman et al. 1984), it is\nlikely that there is no time zero, at which a plasma cloud is\nrelativistically expelled without containing energetic particles.\nBecause of this, the start-up phase visible in our results would\nbe a consequence of our particular treatment of the problem,\nand not a physical phenomenon.\nIn section 6 we have found that only a few of our parameters significantly modify the asymptotic behaviour. The average\nsystem size only affects the observed photon spectra around the\nturn-over frequency, where \u03c4 = 1, and the particulars of the geometry are unknown anyway. The initial particle distributions\nwon't modify the asymptotic temperature evolution either, because the presence of a moderate amount of non-thermal particles only modifies the time required to reach a balance of gains\nand losses. Variations of the matter densities have already been\ninvestigated in section 6. All other initial parameters do not\nmodify the general behaviour of the system.\n\n8. Summary and conclusions\nIn this paper we have investigated the evolution of thermal\nplasma in AGN jets and its impact on the optical-to-infrared\nphoton emission. In matter-dominated jets sizable quantities\nof gas should exist, in particular in the compression zones\nnear the collision fronts that are an implicite ingredient of\nFermi-type particle acceleration scenarios. We conduct our\nstudy in the framework of the channeled outflow model of\n(Pohl & Schlickeiser 2000), who have studied the kinetic relaxation of particles that have traversed a parallel collision front\nfrom the upstream to the downstream region. This pick-up\nprocess occurs due to scattering off low-wavenumber plasma\nwaves that the picked-up particles generate themselves through\nstreaming instabilities. The calculations, thus, describe the first\nhalf-cycle of the standard shock acceleration process for relativistic, collisionless flows. If the outflow plasma propagating\nthrough the jet is dense, the downstream region provides a target for the ultra-relativistic protons to interact with and produce\nradiation through various leptonic and hadronic emission channels.\nNon-relativistic thermal gas in AGN jets noticably contributes to the optical depth at radio to infrared frequencies, and\nmuch less to the emission, with an efficiency that is strongly\ntemperature-dependent. Assuming that this plasma is in a thermal equilibrum, we have calculated the temperature evolution\nresulting from the competition of radiative cooling and heating by Coulomb processes and absorption of non-thermal emission.\nSimilar to the well-known results for the structure of the\ninterstellar medium in Galaxies, we find that the stable regimes\nexist for temperatures between 104 K and 105 K, and around\n108 K. Below 104 K the ionization fraction will be small, and\nthe optical depth is modified. Above 108 K, the thermal parti-\n\n\f12\n\nM. Siewert et al.: The impact of thermal gas in AGN jets on the low-frequency emission\n\na\n\ncles reach relativistic velocities, for which our model begins to\nbreak down.\nIn the model of Pohl & Schlickeiser (2000), short-time\nvariability at low energies arises on account of density fluctuations in the upstream medium. Consequently the plasma temperature will vary, and so will the thermal absorption coefficient. The observable flux of low-frequency emission is thus\nmodulated by the temperature evolution of the thermal gas, and\nit can therefore display very complicated variability behaviour.\nFor simple density profiles of the interstellar gas in AGN host\ngalaxies, we have calculated the temperature response of the\nthermal gas in the jet, and have then derived light curves at different frequencies. For sufficiently long observing times, all of\nthese light curves turn out to be strongly correlated with each\nother, independent of the proton injection scheme, only on account of the deceleration of the jet.\nAcknowledgements.

The optical thickness needs to be\ncalculated with respect to the geometry of the system. In the\ncase of the cylinder geometry this expression can be evaluated,\nwith several one-dimensional integrals remaining which must\nbe treated numerically.\nTo solve equation A.1, we treat the emitting surface in\nCartesian coordinates. (If we used polar coordinates, we would\nend up with two-dimensional numerical integrals.) We define\nour coordinate system as presented in fig.A.1. Then the problem reduces to an integral over all impact parameters a and an\nintegral over all 'slices' x = \u2212w(a)..w(a).
