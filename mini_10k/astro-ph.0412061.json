If the WIMP is assumed to be the neutralino, the lightest supersymmetric particle, two types of couplings with matter have to be\nconsidered: scalar (spin-independent) and axial-vector (spin-dependent) [2].\nFor sufficiently heavy nuclei, the spin-independent interaction is expected\nto give the dominant contribution [2], due to the coherent enhancement approximately proportional to A2 , the square of the mass number. Experimental results are thus most often given as exclusion curves for the spinindependent WIMP-nucleon diffusion cross-section (see for instance [3, 4, 5, 6]\nand references therein).\nFor spin-dependent couplings, this enhancement is not present due to\ncancellation effects between paired nucleons within the nucleus. For example, in the single-particle shell model [7] the nuclear spin comes from the\nunpaired proton or neutron. Even with high-spin nuclei the sensitivity of\ndirect detection experiments on the WIMP-nucleon cross-section is orders\nof magnitude lower than for the spin-independent case (see Refs. [8] and [9]\nfor recent reviews). For axial-vector coupling, indirect detection experiments\nsearching for high-energy neutrinos produced by WIMP annihilations in the\nSun provide much higher sensitivity than direct detection ones [9]: the capture rate of WIMPs in the Sun core is governed by the scattering rate on\nprotons (low mass, high specific spin).\nFor spin-dependent interactions, comparisons between WIMP-nucleon\ncross-section limits given by various experiments is problematic: the comparison of results obtained using targets with either an unpaired neutron\nor an unpaired proton relies on the assumptions concerning the ratio of the\nWIMP-neutron to the WIMP-proton cross-sections. This is particularly obvious in the framework of the simple single-particle model. Although it is\nexpected that this ratio should be O(1) in minimal supersymmetric models [10], Tovey et al. [1] have proposed a method to extract limits on the\nspin-dependent interaction in the more general case where there is no constraint on this ratio. For a given WIMP mass, exclusion curves are obtained\nin the plane of the effective WIMP-neutron and WIMP-proton couplings.\nThe same type of exclusion curves has been computed very recently [9] using\na more rigorous formalism. Evaluations of current results of spin-dependent\nWIMP searches have been given using both techniques [8, 9].\nThe EDELWEISS collaboration searches for WIMP dark matter using\nnatural Ge cryogenic detectors [11, 4, 12]. The whole data set of the first\n1\n\n\fphase of the experiment contains a fiducial exposure of 4.8 kg.day on 73 Ge,\nthe naturally present (7.8%), high-spin Ge isotope. The aim of this paper is to compare, for the spin-dependent interaction and using the modelindependent framework of Ref. [1], EDELWEISS limits with those of the\nmost representative high spin target experiments. It will be shown that, despite the very low 73 Ge content of natural Ge, the EDELWEISS sensitivity\nfor the WIMP-neutron coupling is competitive.\n\nExperimental data\nThe EDELWEISS experiment is set in the Laboratoire Souterrain de\nModane (LSM) in the Fr\u00e9jus tunnel connecting France and Italy. Detectors used by the experiment are 320 g Ge phonon and ionization cryogenic\ndetectors placed in a dilution cryostat at a regulated temperature of 17 mK.\nThe experimental setup is described elsewhere [4, 11].\nThe main characteristic of the EDELWEISS detectors is the simultaneous measurement of the phonon and the ionization signals. The ionization\nsignal is measured by Al electrodes sputtered on each side of the crystal\nand the phonon signal by a NTD heat sensor glued onto one electrode. The\nmeasurement of both signals provides a very good event-by-event discrimination between nuclear and electronic recoils, typically more than 99.9% above\n15 keV. More details on the detectors and their performances can be found\nin Ref. [12]. Following the first published data [4, 11], a new set of three\ndetectors was operated in the cryostat, all of them having either a Ge or Si\namorphous layer for better charge collection.\nBetween 2000 and 2003, four physics runs have been performed with\ndifferent detectors, trigger conditions and efficiencies. All these runs have\nbeen re-analysed with an uniform analysis threshold of 15 keV and using the\nefficiency versus recoil energy function of each run. A detailed presentation\nof the experimental data and a thorough discussion of their analysis is given\nin Ref. [13]. Only the most relevant features are summarized hereafter.\nIn 2000 and 2002, 13.6 kg.day (after the fiducial volume cut) were accumulated with two detectors [4, 11]. Two events compatible with nuclear\nrecoils have been recorded in 2000 above the new analysis threshold of 15\nkeV, and two in 2002. In 2003 two other runs have been performed with\nnew detectors but with two different triggers. In the first run, the trigger\nwas the fast ionization signal (run 2003i, fiducial exposure 25.7 kg.day). In\nthe second run, the trigger was the phonon signal (run 2003p, fiducial exposure 22.7 kg.day). This latter trigger condition improves the efficiency at\nlow energy: the baseline resolution is better on the phonon channel and the\nfull recoil energy deposition ER is recorded, instead of the quenched frac2\n\n\ftion EI = Q.ER in the ionization channel. In the runs 2003i and 2003p,\nthe numbers of observed events compatible with nuclear recoils above the\nanalysis threshold are 17 and 19, respectively. This apparent increase of the\nraw nuclear recoil rates in the new 2003 runs is explained by the significant\nincrease in efficiency at low energy in the new data set (see Ref. [13] for\ndetails). Only three events lie in the energy interval from 30 to 100 keV, a\nresult consistent with the previous data sets [4, 11]. The entire set of data\nfor the EDELWEISS-I experiment consists therefore of a fiducial exposure of\n62.0 kg.day with a total of 40 events compatible with nuclear recoils above\n15 keV. Conservatively considering all these events as WIMP interactions, a\n90 % C.L. upper limit on the WIMP-nucleon cross-section as a function of\nthe WIMP mass is derived with the Optimum Interval Method [14].\nFor the spin-dependent coupling, one must consider the exposure on 73 Ge\n(4.8 kg.day) and a specific form factor. Here, the form factor of Dimitrov\net al. [15] is used, with the usual approximation that the isoscalar, isovector\nand interference form factors are identical in order to make the form factor\nindependent of the WIMP-nucleon couplings [1]. The resulting uncertainty\non the cross-section is within \u00b115% up to a WIMP mass of 1 TeV/c2 . Other\ncalculations of spin-dependent scattering on 73 Ge are briefly presented hereafter. The resulting 90 % C.L. limits on the WIMP-nucleus cross-section\n\u03c3A for WIMP masses between 20 GeV/c2 and 1 TeV/c2 are listed in table 1. These limits are conservative as they neglect any contribution from\nthe spin-independent coupling.\n\nModel-independent Exclusion Limits\nFor spin-dependent interactions the WIMP-nucleus cross-section \u03c3A at\nzero momentum transfer can be approximated by the expression (see for\ninstance [2]):\n32\nJ +1\n\u03c3A = G2F \u03bc2A (ap hSp i + an hSn i)2\n,\n(1)\n\u03c0\nJ\nwhere GF is the Fermi coupling constant, \u03bcA the WIMP-nucleus reduced\nmass, ap,n the effective WIMP-proton(neutron) couplings, hSp,n i the expectation values of the proton(neutron) spins within the nucleus and J the total\nlim(A)\nnuclear spin. WIMP-nucleon cross-sections \u03c3p,n\nin the limit an,p = 0 respectively, are defined as [1]:\nlim(A)\n\u03c3p,n\n\n3 J \u03bc2p,n \u03c3A\n=\n,\n4 J + 1 \u03bc2A hSp,n i2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03bcp,n is the WIMP-proton(neutron) reduced mass and \u03c3A the WIMPnucleus cross-section limit (at 90% CL) deduced from the experiment.\n3\n\n\fIt is shown in [1] that the allowed values of ap and an for a particular\nWIMP mass obey the inequality:\n\uf8eb\n\nap\n\n\uf8edq\n\nlim(A)\n\n\u03c3p\n\nan\n\n\uf8f62\n\n\u03c0\n\uf8f8 \u2264\n\u00b1q\n.\nlim(A)\n24G2F \u03bc2p\n\u03c3n\n\nThe sign between parentheses is that of\n\nhSp i\n.\nhSn i\n\n(3)\n\nEquation (3) defines two\n\nni\nparallel straight lines in the (an , ap ) plane, the slope of which is \u2212hS\n. The\nhSp i\nallowed values of ap and an are within the band defined by these two lines\n(while in [9] an extremely elongated ellipse is found). For experiments with\nhSp i\ntwo active nuclei with different hS\nratios the combination of the two bands\nni\ngives rise to a closed elliptical contour.\nNuclear spin structure calculations have been recently reviewed by Bednyakov and \u0160imkovic [16]: for 73 Ge the two most comprehensive spin structure analyses are from Ressel et al. [17] and from Dimitrov et al. [15] (see\ntable 2). The corresponding form factors are very similar. In these calculations the neutron spin hSn i varies by \u223c20% depending on the nuclear stucture\nni\nis model dependent, but is always much\nmodel. The value of the ratio hS\nhSp i\ngreater than unity. Thus the odd-N, even-Z nucleus 73 Ge nucleus is mainly\nsensitive to an only, and in that sense is complementary to other detectors\nmade out of odd-Z material such as 23 Na, 127 I, 7 Li, 19 F or 27 Al.\nTable 1 gives the values of the spin-dependent WIMP-nucleon crosssections deduced from our experimental \u03c3A values using eq. (2) and the\nhSp,n i taken from [15].\nlim(A)\nPlots of the WIMP-nucleon cross-sections \u03c3p,n\nversus the WIMP mass\nare shown in Fig. 1 and 2. Figures 3 and 4 show the regions in the\n(an , ap ) plane allowed by EDELWEISS, using eq. (3) and the experimental values of table 1, for two illustrative WIMP masses M\u03c7 = 50 and 500\nGeV/c2 . A comparison is made with other experiments representative of various techniques: NaI scintillators (NAIAD experiment [18]), fluored bolometers (Kamioka LiF [19]), sapphire bolometers (CRESST-I [20]), freon droplets\n(SIMPLE [21], PICASSO [22]) and the other natural Ge cryogenic experiment (CDMS-II [5]). A more exhaustive comparison can be found in the\nreview of Giuliani [8]. All experiments use the same dark matter halo model\nto extract \u03c3A . Form factors, values of hSp,n i specific to each nucleus and\nlim(A)\nWIMP-nucleon cross-sections \u03c3p,n\nare given in [18], [19], [21] and [22] .\nFor the CRESST-I (sapphire) experiment, relevant cross-sections can be\ndeduced from the published data using hSp,n i values from [23] for 27 Al (neglecting the 16 O spin sensitivity). For the CDMS experiment limits on spindependent nucleon cross-sections are derived in Ref. [9], including the cou-\n\n4\n\n\fpling dependency in the form factor rather than taking the isoscalar, isovector\nlim(A)\nand interference terms to be identical. For consistency, \u03c3p,n\nare recomputed from the CDMS data (no event in 52.6 kg.day raw exposure in Ge\ndetectors over 10 to 100 keV recoil energy) using the experimental efficiency\nquoted in Ref. [9], form factor and hSp,n i values from Ref. [15]. The differences\nin the an allowed regions defined by the two calculations are insignificant in\nthe limit ap = 0.\nThe DAMA/Xe experiment [24] makes use of a 129 Xe target, an other\nexample of odd-N, even-Z nucleus, as 73 Ge. The \u03c3plim(A) can be calculated\nfrom the reported \u03c3nlim(A) cross-section. However this result deserves a special\ncomment. The value of the quenching factor for liquid Xenon is taken in [24]\nas Q = 0.44, i.e. more than a factor of 2 greater than other measured\nvalues [25, 26]. Adopting these more recent and precise values shifts the\nnuclear recoil energy threshold of the DAMA/Xe experiment from 30 keV to\nat least 60 keV. For M\u03c7 = 50 GeV/c2 the WIMP event rate at the threshold\nis then divided by a factor of 15 and even more if the fast decrease of the\nform factor with recoil energy is taken into account. The cross-section limit\nis underestimated by the same factor. This considerable uncertainty on the\nactual recoil energy scale does not allow any reliable comparison and the\npublished results of DAMA/Xe are not shown on the figure.\nFig. 3 and 4 show that cryogenic natural Ge experiments such as EDELWEISS and CDMS give the most stringent limits on an , at roughly the same\nlevel as the ap limits given by odd-Z detectors. The low 73 Ge content of natural Ge is balanced by the very low level of nuclear recoil backgrounds achieved\nin the cryogenic detectors and by the high neutron nuclear spin value of 73 Ge.\nThe allowed region of minimal extension in the (an , ap ) plane is given by the\ncombination of experiments with respectively high hSn i and high hSp i nuclei.\nThe best limit on an is presently set by the CDMS experiment [5]. As shown\nin Ref. [9] the limit on ap set by the neutrino observatories Super-K [27] and\nBaksan [28] is more than a factor of 10 better than current direct detection\nresults.\n\nConclusions\nFor a WIMP mass between 50 and 500 Gev/c2 , current limits given by\nSD\ndirect detection experiments are |an,p | < few units, or equivalently \u03c3p,n\n< few\npb. The maximal values given by SUSY models lie two orders of magnitude\nlower (see for instance [10, 29, 30]). Only a new generation of experiments\ndesigned to gain two orders of magnitude in sensitivity will be able to reach\nSD\nthe SUSY predictions for \u03c3p,n\n. EDELWEISS-II is one of these forthcoming\n5\n\n\fexperiments [31].\nIn the experimentally constrained versions of Supersymmetry, the neutralino is not a pure gaugino and one expects |ap |/|an | \u223c O(1) (for example\nsee Ref. [10]). To go beyond these constraints and fix limits on ap by the\ndirect detection technique, high sensitivity experiments, using efficient background rejection techniques and high hSp i nuclear targets are needed. A multi\nnuclear target experiment, with powerful background discrimination capability and complementary proton vs neutron spin values would constitute an\ninteresting new approach. Setting decisive constraints on the SUSY parameters for spin-dependent WIMP-nucleon interactions remains a considerable\nexperimental challenge for direct detection experiments.\n\nAcknowledgments\nIt is a pleasure to thank Franco Giuliani and Chris Savage for stimulating\ndiscussions.
