Unfortunately, the observational record is sparse because\nthese stars are rare and their importance has only been fully recognized in recent years.\nModern supernova surveys are finding a growing assortment of similar and related objects. These \"impostors\" are under-luminous, have spectra with narrow emission lines and\nmuch slower ejection velocities. Some of these objects may be undergoing 'giant' eruptions\npossibly similar to \u03b7 Car but with much shorter durations (e.g., SN 2009ip, Smith et al.\n(2010)). Others appear to be generically related to the normal LBV/S Dor variables like SN\n2002kg (Var 37 in NGC 2403; Weis & Bomans (2005); Van Dyk et al. (2006); Maund et al.\n(2006)). A third subgroup including SN 2008S and the NGC 300 optical transient were\nheavily obscured prior to the outburst (Prieto et al. 2008; Prieto 2008); their progenitors\nmay have recently evolved from a high mass losing stage such as an AGB star or red\nsupergiant (Smith et al. 2009; Bond et al. 2009; Berger et al. 2009; Botticella et al. 2009;\nThompson et al. 2009; Prieto et al. 2009). We used to think that \"eruptions\" in which the\nstar increased its total luminosity were primarily associated with the most massive stars,\nupwards of 40 \u201350 M\u2299, but the latter pair apparently originated from 10 \u2013 20 M\u2299 stars\n(references above and Gogarten et al. (2009)). It is thus increasingly apparent that these\neruptions or outbursts may not all be the same phenomenon; the objects represent a range\nof stellar masses and may originate from stars in different evolutionary states.\nAlthough discovery of these transient non-terminal eruptions are becoming more common, our information about them is still very incomplete. The most recent addition,\nSN2010U in NGC 4214, was first reported in eruption on 5 February, 2010 (S. Nakano,\nCBET 2161) at apparent magnitude \u223c 16 on unfiltered CCD frames. An early spectrum\n(Marion, Vinko, & Wheeler, CBET 2163) with strong, narrow emission lines of hydrogen,\nCa II and Na I with P Cyg absorptions, quickly showed that it was not a true supernova,\nbut possibly an eruptive variable or transient.\nIn this Letter we present pre and post-eruption observations of SN 2010U and a analysis\nof the associated stellar population in NGC 4214. Our discussion of its light curve, spectrum,\nand limitations on the mass and luminosity of its likely progenitor suggest that SN2010U is\na very luminous nova, not the eruption of a massive star.\n\n2.\n\nPre- and Post\u2013Eruption Observations\n\nThe discovery photometry for SN 2010U reported in CBET 2161 listed magnitudes of\n16.0 (Feb 5.6), 16.3 (Feb 5.7), 15.9 (Feb 6.5) amd 16.3 (Feb 6.6) on unfiltered CCD frames\nfrom different observers. However a fainter R magnitude of 17.3 was reported by Brimacombe\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nalso on Feb. 6, 20101 . This difference of more than a magnitude in such a short time seemed\ntoo large to be realistic. At our request, the observers kindly provided their unfiltered\nCCD images. We determined the magnitude of SN 2010U relative to three SDSS stars\nin the field with gri photometry converted to broadband R magnitudes. The photometry\nwas done on galaxy-subtracted images, using a SDSS r-band image for the template galaxy\n(Freedman et al. 2009). The results yield an R band magnitude near 17 mag \u00b1 0.2 \u2013 0.3 mag.\nWe also obtained post-eruption photometry of SN 2010U with Retrocam on the MDM2\nHiltner 2.4m telescope on Kitt Peak and the Large Binocular Camera (Giallongo et al. 2008)\non the LBT3 on Mt. Graham. The journal of observations and measured magnitudes for SN\n2010U are included in Table 1 and the resulting light curve is shown in Figure 1.\nAdopting an approximate \"R-band\" magnitude of 17.1 for maximum light yields a red\nabsolute magnitude of \u2248 \u221210.5 at a distance of \u2248 3.2 Mpc for NGC 4214 with AR = 0.06\nmag foreground Galactic reddening from the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database4. SN\n2010U was clearly sub-luminous for a supernova. Its maximum luminosity was more like the\nclassical LBVs in their high mass loss or optically thick wind stage (Humphreys & Davidson\n1994). However SN 2010U's very rapid decline is not typical of LBVs.\nWe located the position of the transient on a deep, archival pre-outburst HST/WFC3\nF814W image of NGC 4214 (Proposal 11360; PI R. O'Connell) obtained on 2009, Dec. 23,\nand shown in Figure 2. To solve the relative astrometry between the post-outburst LBT\nR-band image obtained on 2010, Mar. 18, and the pre-outburst WFC3 image, we used 6\nbright, isolated point sources around the position of the transient identified in the WFC3\nimage. The astrometric solution was obtained using a 2nd order polynomial transformation\nwith standard tasks in IRAF (geotran and geomap). The final rms of the solution is 0.\u2032\u2032 013\nand 0.\u2032\u2032 021 in the x and y axis of the WFC3 image, respectively. As can be seen in Figure 2,\nthere is no progenitor identified in the pre-outburst WFC3 image within the uncertainties\nof the relative astrometry. We obtained consistent results using shallower archival WFPC2\n1\n\nhttp://www.rochesterastronomy.org/sn2010/index.html.\n\n2\n\nThe MDM Observatory is owned and operated by a consortium of five universities: the University of\nMichigan, Dartmouth College, the Ohio State University, Columbia University, and Ohio University.\n3\n\nThe Large Binocular Telescope is an international collaboration among institutions in the United States,\nItaly and Germany. The LBT Corporation partners are: the University of Arizona on behalf of the Arizona\nuniversity system; the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica, Italy; the LBT Beteiligungsgesellschaft, Germany,\nrepresenting the Max Planck Society, the Astrophysical Institute Potsdam, and Heidelberg University; the\nOhio State University; and the Research Corporation, on behalf of the University of Minnesota, University\nof University of Notre Dame, and University of Virginia.\n4\n\nhttp://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nand LBT pre-outburst images.\nThe associated stellar population is shown on the CMD in Figure 3. The HST/WFPC2\nF 555W and F 814W archival observations obtained on 1997 December 9 were reduced using\nthe same procedure and with the same quality cuts as applied to the ANGST sample (details\nin Dalcanton et al. (2009)). The observations were calibrated and flat-fielded using the\nstandard HST pipeline and the magnitudes were measured using HSTphot (Dolphin 2000).\nOnly the highest quality photometry is used for the CMD. The color-coding corresponds to\nthe spatial distribution of the stars relative to the position of SN 2010U in the lower panel.\nWe find no visible star at the position of SN 2010U down to the 50% completeness\nlimiting magnitudes of 24.4 and 23.5 of the F 555W and F 814W images, respectively, and\nthus no candidate precursor. At the distance of NGC 4214, these magnitude limits imply an\nupper limit of \u223c \u22123.2 mag to the absolute visual magnitude of a possible progenitor. Most\nof the stars within \u2248 100 pc of SN2010U are relatively faint and red, with F 555W \u2212 F 814W\ncolors of \u223c 1 \u2013 2 mag, suggesting that the likely precursor is associated with an evolved\npopulation. Of course, it is possible that the progenitor star may have been heavily obscured\nby circumstellar dust prior to its eruption similar to the NGC 300 OT (Prieto 2008) and SN\n2008S (Prieto et al. 2008), and therefore be an intrinsically more luminous star. However, the\nspatial distribution (Figure 3) of the younger and more luminous main sequence stars, shows\nthat the precursor star is not closely associated with a more massive young population. This,\nhowever, does not rule out an obscured, evolved star (AGB) of lower mass. Based on the\nCMD's, the characteristics of the associated stellar population, and the limiting magnitudes\nof the images, we suggest that the progenitor (or its companion) was most likely an evolved\nintermediate mass star, with an upper mass limit of 3 to 5 M\u2299.\nThis conclusion is supported by the post-maximum spectrum obtained on 20 February,\n2010, fourteen days after discovery. The CCDS spectrograph on the Hiltner 2.4m MDM\ntelescope was used with the 150l grating giving a resolution of \u223c 14\u00c5 with a 2\u2032\u2032 slit. The low\nresolution spectrum is shown in Figure 4. The spectrum is dominated by strong emission\nlines of H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 plus the O I blend at \u03bb7774\u00c5. This is not the spectrum of an LBV at\nmaximum nor does it resemble the spectra of the less luminous transients like SN 2008S\nand the NGC 300 - OT. The strong O I emission indicates it is most like a post-maximum\nnova. The lines are resolved with a FWHM of \u223c 1900 km s\u22121 , and the radial velocities of\ntheir line centers are 200 \u2013 300 km s\u22121 . The H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 line profiles are asymmetric to the\nred, and H\u03b1 has asymmetric wings extending to \u22122300 km s\u22121 and +3200 km s\u22121 . The\nasymmetry in the line profiles and the wings may be due to remnant P Cyg absorption. H\u03b1\nand O I \u03bb7774\u00c5 also have split profiles possibly indicative of a bi-polar outflow or planar\ndisk (Lynch et al. 2006). Similar profiles are often observed in classical novae (Lynch et al.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n2006; Austin et al. 1996; Della Valle et al. 2002). The blue and red emission peaks in the O\nI line are shifted by \u2212610 and +460 km s\u22121 , respectively, relative to the line center. The\ncorresponding shifts in H\u03b1 are less, \u2212374 km s\u22121 and +150 km s\u22121 . Other weaker lines in\nthe spectrum are identified with Fe II, [Fe II] and [O I]. The nebular [O III] lines may also\nbe present, but they are blended with other lines.\n\n3.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe rapid decline of the light curve, the post-maximum spectrum, and the relatively\nlow mass and luminosity inferred from the lack of a precursor on deep pre-eruption images\nand the associated stellar population, all suggest that SN 2010U was a luminous nova.\nSN 2010U shares characteristics with the fast novae. If we adopt the observations by\nthe amateur observers and assume that it was at or near maximum, then the time to decline\nby two magnitudes (t2 ) is 15 days and the time to decline three magnitudes (t3 ) is 26 days.\nThese decline rates are consistent with a fast nova. Classical novae obey the MaximumMagnitude-Rate of Decline relation (MMRD) of Della Valle & Livio (1995). Adopting Mr ,\nof \u221210.5 for maximum light and a V \u2212 R color of 1.1 to 1.5 mag from V1500 Cyg, a classical\nnova a few days past maximum light (Gallagher & Ney 1976), Mv is \u2248 \u22129 to \u22129.4 mag,\nnear the upper luminosities observed for CNe. A t2 of 15 days implies a maximum Mv of\n\u22128.7 mag (Downes & Duerbeck 2000), comparable to SN 2010U's maximum luminosity. Of\ncourse, it is possible that maximum was missed and SN 2010U was more luminous, but the P\nCyg profiles reported in CBET 2163 indicate that it was not missed by more than a few days.\nFurthermore, a typical fast to moderately fast nova, with t2 \u223c 15 days, has emission lines\nwith FWHM from 2000 km s\u22121 up to as high as 6000 km s\u22121 . SN 2010U is on the low end\nbut consistent with this range. Kasliwal et al. (2010) have recently described a group of fast\nand luminous novae that are apparently inconsistent with the MMRD relation. However,\nSN 2010U is at the upper end of luminosities expected from the MMRD relation for normal\nnovae and was super-Eddington at maximum.\nWhile not a high mass eruptive variable like most of the other \"SN impostors\", SN\n2010U was indeed an impostor and is an excellent example of the need for post\u2013maximum\nphotometry and spectra, and a study of the stellar environment to determine the nature and\nevolutionary state of these objects.\nWe are especially grateful to the observers Syuichi Nakano, Koichi Itagaki, Ken-ichi\nKadota, and Toru Yusa for forwarding their discovery images of SN 2010U.

The black circles\nmark the six stars used for the relative astrometry. The red circle marks the position of the\ntransient after solving the relative astrometry between WFC3 and LBT image. All the circles\nhave radius = 0.8\". Top right: LBT image from 2010 March 18 showing SN 2010U and used\nto determine the relative astrometry. The same stars are marked here (circles have the same\nradius) and the red circle marks the position of the transient. Lower left: Zoomed-in WFC3\nF814W image around the position of the transient. The minor and major axes of the blue\nellipse are 3 times the rms of the astrometric solution. The minor axis radius is 0.\u2032\u2032 04, and\nthe major axis radius is 0.\u2032\u2032 06. The rms of the astrometric solution is 0.\u2032\u2032 013 in the x-axis and\n0.\u2032\u2032 021 in the y-axis.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Left Top: CMD from the archival data field (grey), the colors correspond to the\nspatial distribution in the lower panel.
