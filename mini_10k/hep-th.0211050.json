INTRODUCTION\n\nThe N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory is conjectured to have a remarkable\nelectric-magnetic duality [1\u20134]. A special form of this conjecture suggests that the electric\ntheory is dual to the magnetic theory with a dual group and an inverse coupling constant.\nThis conjecture originated in the study of an SU(2) theory spontaneously broken to U(1)\n[1,2], where there is only one type of fundamental (anti-)monopole. The supersymmetric\nmultiplet based on this monopole is dual to the massive gauge supermultiplet.\nIf the rank r of the gauge group is higher than one, when the non-Abelian gauge symmetry\nis maximally broken to U(1)r , the monopole configurations can be treated as superpositions\nof fundamental monopoles associated with simple roots [5]; while for elementary particles,\neach root of the dual group corresponds to a massive gauge supermultiplet. Studies of supersymmetric sigma models on the monopole moduli spaces [6] show that these supersymmetric\nfundamental monopoles indeed form threshold bound states as predicted by the duality. To\nillustrate this, we use monopoles in SO(5) \u2192 U(1)2 theory. The root diagrams of SO(5)\nand its dual group Sp(4) are shown in Fig.1. A unique normalizable anti-self-dual harmonic\ntwo-form is found [6] on the moduli space of the \u03b2 and \u03b3 monopoles (we have chosen and\nlabeled the simple roots as \u03b2 and \u03b3). This corresponds to a threshold bound state. The\nsupersymmetric multiplet associated with this bound state in SO(5) is dual to the \u03b1\u2217 gauge\nmultiplet in Sp(4) as predicted by the duality.\nThe situation is more subtle when a non-Abelian subgroup of the gauge symmetry remains unbroken. In such cases, BPS configurations of massless monopole clouds (or nonAbelian clouds) have been found [7,8]. These configurations describe massive monopoles\nsurrounded by clouds of the non-Abelian fields, which form an overall magnetic color singlet. In addition to the usual moduli of positions and U(1) phases of the massive monopoles,\nthere are also ones describing the unbroken non-Abelian gauge group, as well as the sizes\nor shapes of the clouds. There have been many extended studies on both the BPS configurations [9\u201315] and the low energy classical dynamics [16\u201318] of such clouds. However,\nit remains unclear how such configurations and their properties should be properly placed\nin the context of the electric-magnetic duality of the N = 4 theory and how it may be\nrelated to the properties of the QCD confinement. It is the purpose of this paper to make\nsome initial steps toward this direction. First we observe that these low energy non-Abelian\nclouds should be identified as the dual bremsstrahlung radiation of the non-Abelian massless\nparticles. Then, after breaking the supersymmetry, we argue that the non-BPS properties\nof these cloud are the manifestation of the non-Abelian dual Meissner effect at weak electric\ncoupling above the QCD scale. We expect it to continuously go to the non-Abelian dual\n1\n\n\f\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b1*\n\n*\n\n\u03bc*\n\n\u03bc\n\u03b3*\n\n\u03b3\n\nSO(5)\n\nSp(4)\n\nFIG. 1.

MASSLESS MONOPOLE CLOUDS AND BREMSSTRAHLUNG RADIATION\n\nWe use the same SO(5) example. The gauge symmetry is now partially broken to SU(2)\n\u00d7 U(1) by a Higgs expectation value h orthogonal to the root \u03b3 or \u03b3 \u2217 [19]. Correspondingly,\nthe \u03b3 monopoles or \u03b3 \u2217 elementary particles become massless. A spherically symmetric BPS\nmagnetic monopole solution is found in [7]. It describes a massive monopole, embedded in\nthe SU(2) subgroup defined by the root \u03b2, surrounded by a non-Abelian cloud. There is a\nmodulus a characterizing the size of the cloud. We will be interested only in the non-Abelian\nfields which do not exponentially decay outside the massive monopole core m\u22121\nW :\nAai(\u03b3) = \u01ebaim r\u0302m G(r) ,\n\n\u03c6a\u03b3 = r\u0302a G(r) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the subscripts \u03b3 mean that the fields correspond to the triplet SU(2) generators ta (\u03b3)\n(a = 1, 2, 3) associated with the root \u03b3, and\nG(r) =\n\n1\n.\ner(1 + r/a)\n\n(2)\n\nIf the cloud size a is infinite, we only have the massive monopole, carrying both Abelian and\nnon-Abelian charges. If a is finite, the cloud shields the non-Abelian charge of the massive\none, so that the non-Abelian fields fall as a/r 2 outside of the radius a, as we can see from\n(1) and (2).\nThe metric for this massless monopole cloud can be obtained [8] by taking the zero\nreduced mass limit of the maximally broken case:\n2\n\n\fg2\nds =\n8\u03c0\n2\n\nda2\n+ a\u03c312 + a\u03c322 + a\u03c332\na\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere g = 4\u03c0/e is the magnetic coupling and \u03c3i (i = 1, 2, 3) are the one-forms describing the\nunbroken SU(2). For this metric, the harmonic (anti-)self-dual form is not normalizable. So\nthe massless monopole cloud is not bound. It has been a puzzle [8] why this configuration,\nwhich is dual to the \u03b1\u2217 gauge multiplet in the Sp(4) theory, does not have a normalizable\nthreshold bound state as in the maximally broken case.\nTo answer that, we first look at the elementary particles in the weakly coupled electric\ntheory of Sp(4). Because the beta function vanishes in the N = 4 supersymmetric gauge\ntheory [20], the massless particles of the non-Abelian gauge multiplet \u03b3 \u2217 in this weakly\ncoupled theory are not confined. Therefore, whenever a massive particle is coupled to these\n\nmassless ones, it emits non-Abelian infrared bremsstrahlung radiation. For example, the\nmassive \u03b1\u2217 Higgs can become a massive \u03b2 \u2217 Higgs by emitting an infrared gauge or Higgs\nboson associated with the root \u03b3 \u2217. Generalizing this, the massive gauge multiplets \u03b1\u2217 and\n\u03b2 \u2217 become indistinguishable through the emission and absorption of the massless gauge\nsupermultiplet associated with \u03b3 \u2217.1\nThese two descriptions for the monopoles and elementary particles are very different.\nThe former describes a solitonic static field configuration, while the latter describes massless\nelementary particles that propagate in the speed of light. To see how they can be dual to\neach other, we need to analyze the low energy supersymmetric quantum mechanics of the\nmassless monopole clouds on the moduli space.\nTo see what happens, we need to find the spherically symmetric eigenstates of the Laplacian \u25b3 = dd\u2020 + d\u2020 d corresponding to the metric (3) [21]. These non-normalizable scattering\nstates can be described by sixteen harmonic differential forms which are the duals of the\ngauge supermultiplet \u03b3 \u2217 . Up to constant factors, these are given by\nq\n1\n\u221a J1 g Ea/2\u03c0 ,\na\n\u0012\n\n0 \u2212 form :\n1 \u2212 forms :\n2 \u2212 forms :\n\n\u0013\n\nq\n\u0010 q\n\u0011\n1\nJ2 g Ea/2\u03c0 da , J2 g Ea/2\u03c0 \u03c3i , (i = 1, 2, 3) ,\na\n\u0013\n\u0012 q\n1\n\u221a J1 g Ea/2\u03c0 (da \u2227 \u03c31 + a\u03c32 \u2227 \u03c33 ) , and cyclic,\na\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n1 It\n\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n\nis interesting to compare this SO(5) example to a single massive fundamental monopole in\nSU(3) \u2192 SU(2) \u00d7 U(1) theory, where the massless monopole cloud is absent. On the dual side,\nfor a single massive elementary particle in this SU(3) theory, the non-Abelian charge is unchanged\n(or gauge equivalent) after infrared radiation.\n\n3\n\n\fac\ng>>1\n\n\u03bbw\n\n\u03bbs\n\nac\ng<<1\n\n\u03bbw\n\nFIG. 2. The cloud wave functions for the two different cases, g \u226b 1 and g \u226a 1. The three\ndifferent length scales ac \u2248 g2 /E, \u03bbw \u2248 1/E and \u03bbs \u2248 1/(g 2 E) are indicated in these two different\ncases. The part within ac is the solitonic phase, whose wave function is given by Eqs. (4) - (7).\nOutside ac is the spherical wave. For g \u226b 1, ac is the biggest length scale, while for g \u226a 1, ac is\nthe smallest.\nq\n1\n\u221a J3 g Ea/2\u03c0 (da \u2227 \u03c31 \u2212 a\u03c32 \u2227 \u03c33 ) , and cyclic,\na\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(7)\n\nwhere E is the arbitrarily small energy of the massless monopole cloud and J's are Bessel\nfunctions. The \u03c3i 's and da correspond to fermionic excitations. The 3-forms and 4-form\nare the Hodge duals of the 1-forms and 0-form, respectively. The a-dependence of these\nwave functions are all similar. For\nexample, the 0-form wave function goes to a constant for\nq\n2\u03c0\na \u226a g2 E and falls as a\u22123/4 cos(g Ea/2\u03c0 \u2212 3\u03c0/4) for a \u226b g2\u03c0\n2E .\n\nHowever the moduli space approximation for the low energy solitons usually requires\nsmall velocities. For the case of the massless monopole cloud, this requires [18] \u0227 < 1. From\n2\n\ng\n. Beyond this region the moduli\nthe metric (3), this imposes the restriction a < ac = 8\u03c0E\nspace approximation fails and the cloud propagates as a wavefront at the speed of light\n[18]. So the wave function should be replaced by the spherical wave \u223c eiEa /a as a > ac ,\n\nwhere a becomes the position of the wavefront. As we turn to the weak magnetic coupling\n(small g) limit, the duality conjecture suggests that the monopoles and the elementary gauge\nparticles exchange roles. Indeed, as we can see, the extent of the solitonic wave function ac\nis much smaller then the wavelength (\u223c 1/E) of the wavefront and, in addition, inside ac\nthe wave function is nearly a constant. Thus the solitonic phase is negligible. (See Fig. 2.)\nThe massless monopole always appears as infrared radiation and the elementary local field\n4\n\n\fdescription takes over.\nThe above discussion is in accordance with the classical dynamics discussed in [18],\ni.e. the prediction of the moduli space approximation from (3) that a \u223c t2 E/g 2 is good only\nfor a time period of order g 2/E during which the cloud speed \u0227 < 1. According to the\nuncertainty principle, for g < 1, it is quantum mechanically unobservable.\nSo instead of being a problem, the absence of the massive and massless monopole bound\nstates is in fact consistent with the duality. As we turn the coupling g from strong to weak,\nthe unbound cloud becomes the infrared non-Abelian radiation of elementary particles and\nthe solitonic phase of the cloud disappears quantum mechanically.2\nIn the above discussion, we always studied the weakly coupled theory in the elementary\nparticle sector where particles are local excitations of fields, and the strongly coupled theory\nin the solitonic sector where solitons are non-local objects from the point of view of the\nelementary fields. Both descriptions can happen either in the electric or magnetic theory,\ndepending on the couplings. We will continue to use this method throughout the paper.\nIII. DYNAMICS OF NON-BPS NON-ABELIAN MONOPOLE CLOUDS\n\nNon-Abelian N = 1 or N = 0 supersymmetric gauge theories have the important property of confinement. Significant insights have been made by Seiberg and Witten in [22].\nFrom the exact N = 2 low energy theory, they explicitly show that a superpotential breaking the supersymmetry to N = 1 causes the massless magnetic monopole field to condense.\nThis confinement is described in a weakly coupled magnetic theory through the dual Meissner effect [23]. Related issues starting from N = 4 have also been studied (see e.g. [24] and\nreferences therein).\nIt is natural to ask what roles the non-Abelian clouds we have studied may play in\nthis QCD confinement. To see this, we will focus on the energy region above the QCD\nscale \u039bQCD . Specifically, we start with a N = 4 theory with a weak electric coupling at high\nenergy. In this theory we have argued that, in the presence of certain massive monopoles, we\ncan identify the low energy magnetic non-Abelian clouds as the dual infrared non-Abelian\n\n2 Since\n\nwe are considering the case where all six Higgs vevs in the N = 4 theory are proportional\nin the gauge space, a global SO(6) rotation can make all but one of them zero. An important\ndifference when we go from big g to small g is that, while the Higgs profile of the strongly coupled\nnon-Abelian massless monopole clouds take non-zero values only in one Higgs direction, as we go\nto the weak coupling limit, we can see from the interaction terms in the field theory that these\nmassless radiations can oscillate in all the Higgs directions. This fact will also be useful later.\n\n5\n\n\fparticles by exploring the duality conjecture. When we break the supersymmetry at low\nenergy, we break the original electric-magnetic symmetry. But the dual states we identified\nshould still exist and we will be interested in how they evolve as the supersymmetry is\nbroken. As mentioned, we will focus mostly on the energy region above \u039bQCD , where the\nstrongly coupled magnetic theory is described by non-BPS monopoles. Then we will discuss\nsome implications for the low energy theory below \u039bQCD .\nWe explicitly break the supersymmetry to N = 1 at low energy by adding a superpotential for the N = 1 chiral multiplets. We expand the Higgs around those vacua where part of\nthe non-Abelian symmetry is unbroken and use \u03c6 to represent the non-Abelian components\nof the deviations. Among all the terms in the expansion, we will study the quadratic terms\n1 2\nm tr(\u03c62 )\n2 \u03c6\n\n(8)\n\nas examples. This gives an N = 4 supersymmetry scale m\u03c6 . As mentioned, the fact that\n\nm\u03c6 > \u039bQCD is guaranteed as long as the electric coupling is weak at the supersymmetry\nbreaking scale m\u03c6 . We will be interested in the limit where the non-Abelian Higgs masses m\u03c6\n\nare much smaller than the massive gauge bosons mW . We also want the U(1) Higgs masses\nto be much smaller than the non-Abelian Higgs. By doing this, we effectively make the U(1)\nparts remain BPS so we can concentrate on the non-BPS properties of the non-Abelian parts\nonly. This is why we have neglected the U(1) mass terms in (8).3\nTo study the non-BPS monopoles, it is enough to add a superpotential in the direction\nof the non-zero Higgs. But for later purposes to connect with confinement, we will also add\n\n3 In\n\ncertain models, the above mass relations can be achieved by adjusting the parameters in the\npotential. For instance, consider an SU(2N ) theory with superpotential\n\u0010\n\nW (\u03a6) = m tr(\u03a62 ) + \u03bb tr(\u03a63 ) + \u03b7X tr(\u03a62 ) \u2212 \u03bc2\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere m, \u03bc, \u03bb and \u03b7 are real, and we have introduced a color singlet X to have more adjustable\nparameters. At X = \u2212m/\u03b7, this theory has a N = 1 supersymmetric vacuum where the gauge\nsymmetry\n\u221a is broken to SU(N ) \u00d7 U(1) \u00d7 SU(N ). The mass relations can be satisfied by choosing\ne \u226b \u03bb/ N \u226b \u03b7. Also consistent with this requirement, the dimensionless couplings in this\nsuperpotential have to be very small comparing to the electric coupling e at the supersymmetry\nbreaking scale, so that above this scale the N = 4 supersymmetry is restored. [Because the\ndimensionless parameters \u03bb and \u03b7 grow when we increase the energy, at much higher energy we\nagain return to N = 1. But this does not affect our argument as long as there is a region where\nN = 4 supersymmetry is approximately held.] However to illustrate the properties of the nonAbelian clouds, we will use simpler groups such as the previously mentioned SO(5). We will not\ntry to construct the specific potential for each case, because the simple qualitative features which\nwill be summarized after those examples are true for cases where these mass relations are satisfied.\n\n6\n\n\fsuperpotentials for the other two chiral multiplets. This can be simply given by the mass\nterms with zero Higgs vev. It has no effect on the monopole properties we will discuss.\nWe first study the example in SO(5). The BPS fields are given in (1). When the non-BPS\npotential (8) is added, the non-Abelian Higgs field is exponentially cut off at a distance scale\n\u22121\nm\u22121\n\u03c6 . Outside of the region m\u03c6 where the Brandt-Neri-Coleman (BNC) instability [25,26]\napplies, the gauge field decays to a magnetic-color neutral configuration, which corresponds\n\u22121\n\u22121\nto having a non-Abelian cloud inside m\u22121\n\u03c6 . Since m\u03c6 \u226b mW , the BPS solution (1) is still a\n\u22121\ngood approximation between m\u22121\n\u03c6 and mW . However, the cloud size is no longer a modulus.\n\nIt is easy to see that, under the potential (8), it is classically energetically favored for the\ncloud to shrink. We can use the BPS solution to estimate this a-dependent potential. It is4\ng2 2\nm a.\n8\u03c0 \u03c6\n\n(10)\n\nThis should be a good approximation as the non-BPS potential is weak. The correction is\ngiven by factors of m\u03c6 a. The potential change within the core, r < m\u22121\nW , is negligible.\nUsing the metric (3) and this linear potential, we can study the quantum mechanics of\nthis bounded non-Abelian cloud. This is non-supersymmetric, as the monopole breaks the\nN = 1 supersymmetry. For the purpose of this paper, we simply note that the ground\nstate of the cloud has a mass gap of order m\u03c6 and is concentrated in the region hai \u223c\n\u22121\n2\ng \u22122 m\u22121\n\u03c6 \u226a m\u03c6 , since the factor g can be absorbed in the a in (3) and (10). Any multi-\n\nmonopole configuration can be thought of as being a collection of these color singlets. Since\nwe neglected the U(1) Higgs mass, there are no net long-range forces between the monopoles\nwhen they are separated further than m\u22121\n\u03c6 . Before discussing the physical interpretation of\nthis result, we consider a case where the cloud encloses two massive monopoles.\nWe use the minimal symmetry breaking model of SU(3) [9]. When the two massive\nmonopoles are far apart, so that the non-Abelian Higgs has decayed exponentially, the\nrelative orientation of their non-Abelian gauge charges is self-adjusted to minimize the energy\n[26]. The charges are then given by\n1\n\u221a diag(1, 0, \u22121) ,\n2\n\n1\n\u221a diag(0, 1, \u22121) ,\n2\n\n(11)\n\nrespectively. Here, the first two entries of the matrices correspond to the unbroken SU(2).\nSince only the non-Abelian part is non-BPS, these two monopoles are attracted by the\nCoulomb potential\n\n4 Note\n\nwe have a non-standard kinetic term for a from Eq. (3).\n\n7\n\n\f\u2212\n\ng2\n16\u03c0l2\n\n(l > m\u22121\n\u03c6 ) ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere l is the monopole separation. Here a factor of \u2212 41 is from the inner product of the\nnon-Abelian part of (11), and the Abelian part is neglected because it is approximately\nBPS under our mass conditions mentioned before.5 When the two monopoles stay inside\nthe range m\u22121\n\u03c6 , we can approximate the near-BPS fields outside of the massive cores by the\nsuperposition of two SU(2) monopoles at positions r 1 and r 2 . This gives the Higgs fields at\nr as\ndiag(t1 , t1 + \u221a\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n+\u221a\n, t3 \u2212 \u221a\n\u2212\u221a\n)\n2er1\n2er2\n2er1\n2er2\n\n(13)\n\nif there were no non-Abelian cloud and\ndiag(t1 + \u221a\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n, t1 + \u221a\n, t3 \u2212 \u221a\n\u2212\u221a\n)\n2er1\n2er2\n2er1\n2er2\n\n(14)\n\nwith a minimal size non-Abelian cloud, where diag(t1 , t1 , t3 ) is the vacuum and ri = |r \u2212 r i |\n(i = 1, 2). In the latter case, the non-Abelian field is cancelled at a length scale bigger than\nthe monopole separation l. Therefore, under the potential (8), it is energetically favored to\nhave a minimal size non-Abelian cloud surrounding the massive monopoles. However the\nnon-Abelian Higgs field is still present within the separation scale l. Integrating (8) over the\n6\nspatial region up to m\u22121\n\u03c6 , we obtain an attractive potential\ng2 2\nm l + O(g 2 m3\u03c6 l2 ) (l < m\u22121\n\u03c6 ) .\n32\u03c0 \u03c6\n\n(15)\n\nSo, if the core size is ignored, the massive monopoles will coincide classically and have a\nnon-Abelian cloud bound to them. This is similar to what we have seen in SO(5).\nIV. NON-ABELIAN MONOPOLE CLOUDS AND DUAL MEISSNER EFFECT\n\nThe energy scale m\u03c6 and the linear property of the potentials (10) and (15) may receive\ncorrections from the higher order terms neglected in (8). However, the following qualitative\n\n5 In\n\nthis SU(3) example, the assumption that the Abelian Higgs mass is small is important, because otherwise the Abelian gauge force has a factor of 34 , which makes the overall color singlet\nconfiguration unstable.\n6 For\n\nbig g, this kind of forces will affect the binding energies of the multiple monopole states\nconsidered in [27] where similar Higgs mass relations are taken.\n\n8\n\n\ffeatures do not depend on these terms and the specific examples. Within the N = 4\n\nsupersymmetry length scale m\u22121\n\u03c6 around the massive monopoles, the appearance of the nonBPS Higgs raises the energy above the vacuum due to the non-BPS potential; outside of\nthis scale, we have the BNC instability; so, whenever the topology is allowed, the nonAbelian clouds will always contract to cancel the non-Abelian fields of the enclosed massive\nmonopoles.\nIn our discussion, because the massive monopoles carry non-Abelian magnetic charges,\nthey actually serve as probes so that we can study the properties of the dual non-Abelian\nstates. Unlike the Coulomb-like phase in N = 4 as we saw in Sec. II, these dual states\nnow have effective masses and the non-Abelian magnetic charges are screened. In other\nwords, in this intermediate energy region where we describe the magnetic theory by solitons,\nbreaking the supersymmetry by a superpotential (but maintaining the non-Abelian nature\nof the vacuum) in the weakly coupled electric theory causes the magnetic theory to be in\nan analogous dual Higgs phase. In the following, we will discuss the possibility of this\nphenomenon continuously going to the dual Meissner effect when we lower the energy scale\nm\u03c6 to that of the vacuum state (\u039bQCD ), where the test massive solitonic monopole becomes\nthe test elementary particle.\n\nTo do this, we first note that, although the N = 1 non-Abelian vacuum has the energy\nscale \u039bQCD , we have only seen the non-Abelian clouds at m\u03c6 because we rely on the presence\nof massive non-Abelian monopoles. To look at these non-Abelian clouds at a lower energy\nscale m\u0303\u03c6 (m\u03c6 > m\u0303\u03c6 > \u039bQCD ) with a corresponding bigger electric coupling \u1ebd (according\nto the asymptotic freedom), we should change the set-up by lowering the supersymmetry\nbreaking scale to m\u0303\u03c6 and choose the N = 4 theory above it to have the corresponding\ncoupling \u1ebd. By the same argument we see that, after the supersymmetry breaking, the nonAbelian clouds of the N = 1 theory with coupling g\u0303 are Higgsed and get a mass \u223c m\u0303\u03c6 . The\n< 1 (g > 1).\nsame reasoning can go all the way to e \u223c\n\u223c\n\nFrom e \u223c g \u223c 1 around \u039bQCD , the solitonic description we used in the magnetic theory\nstarts to deviate from being a good approximation. For the massive monopoles, the Compton wavelength begins to exceed the monopole core size. For the non-Abelian clouds, the\npotential becomes too shallow. Only one bound state can exist, with a mass gap g 2 m\u03c6 determined by the depth of the potential. This bound state has a wavelength of order g \u22124 m\u22121\n\u03c6 ,\n\u22121\n<\nwhich begins to exceed the range of the potential m\u22121\n\u03c6 as g \u223c 1. (Outside of m\u03c6 , we still\nhave the BNC instability in the Higgs direction we are considering.) So as mentioned before,\nbelow g \u223c 1 we should switch the roles of elementary particles and the solitons between the\nelectric and magnetic theories. These analyses also suggest that the masses (which should\nbe of order \u039bQCD from the last paragraph) of the dual non-Abelian fields are likely to vary\n9\n\n\fcontinuously, rather than abruptly vanish, at g \u223c 1.7\n\nThis meets the expectation that the usual weakly coupled dual Higgs mechanism starts to\ntake effect. Nielson-Olesen electric flux tubes [28] appear as solitonic objects and this causes\nconfinement of non-Abelian electric charge and electric fields. The quantum fluctuations of\nthese tubes are of order g times the thickness of the flux tubes [28]. Here we comment that\nfor big g above \u039bQCD , these fluctuations are much bigger than the size of the electric flux.\nThis is consistent with the fact that the electric fields are not confined above \u039bQCD , despite\nof the analogous dual Higgs mechanism.\nThe coupling stops running soon after the magnetic perturbation theory starts to become\nvalid, since all the non-Abelian magnetically charged particles obtain masses of order \u039bQCD\nthrough this dual Higgs mechanism.\nSince so far all the non-BPS properties of the N = 1 theory that we have used are\nshared by the non-supersymmetric theory, we can further break the N = 1 supersymmetry\nby adding some soft breaking terms. For example, we can add a non-Abelian gaugino mass\nterm with mass equal to the supersymmetry breaking scale m\u03c6 and get the same picture.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nI would like to thank Brian Greene, David Tong, Piljin Yi and especially Dan Kabat and\nErick Weinberg for many helpful discussions and comments on the manuscript. This work\nwas supported in part by the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\n7 For\n\nthe solitonic description of the magnetic theory at big g, the massive monopoles can only\nprobe one Higgs direction since the non-Abelian clouds are non-zero in only one of the Higgs fields.\nThere it is enough that we have a superpotential for one chiral multiplet. But in order for this\nscreening effect to continuously go to the case g <\n\u223c 1 where the non-Abelian Higgs can oscillate in\nall directions, the superpotential in the other two complex directions of the Higgs should also be\npresent as we mentioned in footnote 2.\n\n10\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[1] C.
