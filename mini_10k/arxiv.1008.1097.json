Only ten such\nsystems are known so far (Stairs 2008; Keith et al.\n2009). The detection of both neutron stars as radio pulsars is a rare situation, as it requires the\nelectromagnetic beam from both pulsars to intercept our line-of-sight during the short interval\nwhen both pulsars are active. The only such system, J0737\u22123039A/B, was discovered in late 2003\nwith the 64-m Parkes radio telescope in Australia\nas part of a high-latitude multibeam survey of\nthe Southern sky (Burgay et al. 2003; Lyne et al.\n2004). It provides an amazing laboratory for the\nstudy of relativistic gravity and the most preScientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),\nP.O. Box 76, Epping, New South Wales 1710, Australia.\n12 Columbia Astrophysics Laboratory, Columbia University, 550 West 120th Street, New York, NY 10027, USA.\n\n1\n\n\flimit on variations of A's profile width at 10% of\nthe pulse peak is only 0.5\u25e6 yr\u22121 (Manchester et al.\n2005). This can be explained by a range of geometrical parameters. Manchester et al. (2005) found\nthat both circular and elliptical beams could fit\nthe data, with a slight preference for an elliptical\nbeam. Ferdman et al. (2008) found that the misalignment between spin and orbital angular momentum axes of pulsar A is very low, with a 95%\nupper limit of 14\u25e6 , assuming emission from both\nmagnetic poles. This supports the idea that the\nformation process of pulsar B was relatively symmetric.\nThe high spin-down energy loss rate of A likely\ncauses the magnetosphere of B to be deformed in\na way similar to that of the Earth by the Solar\nwind (Lyutikov 2004). The long tail will point\ntowards the Earth around the eclipse of A by B,\nnear the inferior conjunction of B (i.e. at an orbital phase of 270\u25e6 , as measured from the ascending node). We find that the bright emission from B\nis detected in two different orbital phase windows:\nat \u223c180\u25e6\u2212240\u25e6 (hereafter BP1), and \u223c260\u25e6 \u2212310\u25e6\n(hereafter BP2). In addition to these two bright\nphases, the pulsar often shows weak emission at\nother orbital phases (Lyne et al. 2004). The exact\nexplanation of this exceptional behavior is challenging. The model of Lyutikov (2005) explains\nthe phenomenon generally, but fails to produce the\nsecond bright phase at the correct orbital phase\n(\u223c245\u25e6 \u2212270\u25e6 instead of \u223c260\u25e6 \u2212310\u25e6). It also can\nnot explain the evolution of the two bright phases\n(see \u00a72.3).\nAnother effect of A's electromagnetic radiation\non B's magnetosphere is drifting subpulses in the\nemission of B which appear similar to those seen\nfor some normal radio pulsars (McLaughlin et al.\n2004). The drifting feature can be seen only in\nBP1 and not in BP2. The separation of the drift\nbands is equal to the period of A, showing that the\ndrifting features are a direct result of the impact\nof A's 44 Hz electromagnetic radiation on B. A\npossible explanation for the occurrence of drifting\nfeatures only in BP1 is the particular geometric\nconfiguration of the two pulsars with respect to\nour line-of-sight. Freire et al. (2009) proposed a\nnew technique for timing the double pulsar system\nby describing a geometrical model which predicts\nthe delay of B's subpulses relative to A's radio\npulses.\n\ncise test to date of general relativity (GR) in the\nstrong-field regime (Kramer et al. 2006). The two\npulsars orbit each other in a 2.4-hr orbit, the shortest of any observed double neutron star binaries,\nwith moderate orbital eccentricity of 0.088.\nThe first-born pulsar is believed to have been\nrecycled, hereafter referred to as 'A', has a short\nspin period of 23 ms and the second-born companion, hereafter 'B', spins with a longer 2.8 s\nperiod. With their strong gravitational fields\nand rapid motions, the system is expected to\nshow large relativistic effects and, indeed, has\na relativistic advance of periastron of 17\u25e6 yr\u22121\n(Kramer et al. 2006), the highest rate of any observed pulsar binary. Another of these effects\nis the relativistic spin precession, also known as\ngeodetic precession, of the pulsar's spin axis about\nthe orbital angular momentum. The theoretical equation formulated by Barker & O'Connell\n(1975) and Boerner et al. (1975) predicts a spin\nprecession rate of 5.061(2)\u25e6 yr\u22121 for pulsar B1 .\nRecently this rate has been constrained to be\n4.8(7)\u25e6 yr\u22121 by fitting a model to the changing morphology of the eclipses of A seen when\nit passes behind the absorbing magnetosphere of\nB (Breton et al. 2008). The spin precession rate\npredicted by general relativity means that it takes\n75 yrs for B's spin axis to complete a full precession cycle about the orbital angular momentum.\nThis high precession rate is expected to have dramatic effects on B's pulse properties as a result\nof the change in apparent geometry with respect\nto our line-of-sight. These include the evolution\nof its pulse profile, light curves, and flux densities\n(Burgay et al. 2005).\nThe orbital plane of this system is almost edgeon to us. The orbital inclination was calculated to\nbe 88.7\u25e6 through timing (Kramer et al. 2006) and\n89.7\u25e6 through modeling of the interstellar scintillation properties of the two pulsars (Coles et al.\n2005). Eclipses of A by B are a fortunate consequence of this favorable geometry. The 2.9 lt-s diameter of the orbit, determined through radio timing, and the 30-s duration of the eclipse, show that\nthe magnetosphere of B is roughly 10% of its lightcylinder radius (Lyne et al. 2004). The pulse profile of the more energetic pulsar A is stable. The\n1 Here,\n\nand throughout the paper, the number in parentheses\nis the 1-\u03c3 uncertainty in the last quoted digit.\n\n2\n\n\fIn this paper, we present a study of the extreme\nvariation of B's pulse profile over time, which concludes with its total radio disappearance in March\n2008. We present an analysis based on more than\nfive years of data taken with the Green Bank Telescope. In \u00a72 we present our observational data and\nour analysis methods. We also discuss the disappearance of B's emission and the evolution of the\nemission from the beam. In \u00a73, we estimate the geometrical parameters of pulsar B by using the empirical circular beam model of Clifton & Weisberg\n(2008) for the two-dimensional pulse profile of a\nprecessing pulsar. Then we extend this model to\nan elliptical beam that explains the profile evolution well and results in realistic geometrical parameters. In \u00a74, we discusses how the different\ntypes of beam shapes relate to the observed pulsar data and show that this is the best explanation\nfor the behavior of B.\n2.\n\ncending node) of each phase in which B is easily\ndetected in early observations. In Fig. 1 and 2,\nwe present the integrated pulse profiles for BP1\nand BP2, respectively, on 12 days that pulsar B\nwas observed at 820 MHz. The very first observation, which was made in December 2003, shows\na unimodal average pulse profile. This unimodal\npulse profile gets broader and splits gradually into\na two-component pulse profile over time. This\nevolution is common for both bright phases, but\nthe specific features are somewhat different.\nThe evolution from a single-peak profile towards a two-peak profile begins around 2006 May\n(MJD 53860). In BP1, the first peak is brighter\nthan the second one. This two-peak profile exists almost until the disappearance of the pulsar\nin this orbital phase region (see Fig. 1). In BP2,\nthe evolution has a similar pattern to BP1, but the\nremarkable difference is that the relative heights of\nthe two peaks differ (see Fig. 2). It initially looks\nsimilar to the profile of BP1, but on MJD 54055\nthe relative amplitudes of the two peaks change\nand the second one becomes more prominent. This\npersists throughout the evolution and we believe\nthat this feature is due to the impact of A's emission on B, the effect of which changes over the\nperiod of the observation. Grey\u2212scale plots of the\nfirst and the second bright phases of the two-peak\nprofile are shown in Fig. 3. The first peak of each\nepoch has been normalized and aligned in both\nphases. It can be clearly seen that the two peaks\nare moving apart and the separation grows with\ntime in both phases simultaneously.\nIn order to get more information on the two\npeaks to describe the evolution, we fit two Gaussians separately for each peak of the two-peak\npulse profile. From the Gaussian fits, we calculate the full-width-half-max (FWHM) of each\npeak of the two-peak pulse profiles in the two\nbright phases. They are shown in Figs. 4 and\n5. Linear least-squares fits qualitatively show that\nthe FWHM of the first peak of BP1 decreases\nwith time while that of the second peak increases\nslightly. In BP2, the FWHM of the first peak\nshows a slight decrease, but the decrease of second is more prominent.\nWe present the evolution of the separation of\nthe peaks in the two bright phases in Fig. 6.The\nrates of separation are calculated from a linear least-squares fit to be 2.6(1)\u25e6 yr\u22121 and\n\nObservations and Analysis\n\nWe observed J0737\u22123039B with the 100-m\nGreen Bank Telescope (GBT) in West Virginia\nfrom 2003 December 24 to 2009 June 20. Our observations are at multiple frequencies - because 820\nMHz is the most common, we use only those data\nfor this paper. Until 2009 January, the data were\ntaken using the GBT spectrometer SPIGOT card\nwith sampling time of 81.92 \u03bcs. SPIGOT provides\n1024 synthesized frequency channels across a 50\nMHz bandwidth. After 2009 January, the GBT\nspectrometer GUPPI was used. It covers 2048\nfrequency channels with sampling time of 61.44\n\u03bcs, with a wider bandwidth of 200 MHz. All the\ndata were dedispersed and folded using the pulsar\nanalysis package SIGPROC, assuming a dispersion measure of 48.914 cm\u22123 pc (Lyne et al. 2004).\nWe used the ephemeris of Lyne et al. (2004) until\n2006, and since then have used the ephemeris of\nKramer et al.

It\nappears that the profiles in both bright regions\npresent the same rate of change in their component separation.\n2.2.\n\nFlux evolution of the two bright\nphases\n\nIn both bright regions, the integrated pulse flux\ndensity has decreased gradually over time (see\nFig. 1 and 2). The pulsar was detected in both\nbright phases with the last significant detection in\nMarch 2008 (MJD 54552) at 820 MHz. We estimated flux densities at 820 MHz using the radiometer equation. First we calculated the radiometer noise, using a system temperature of\n35 K (the system temperature is defined as the\nsum Tsys = Trec + Tspill + Tatm + Tsky ), and considered this as the flux density at the off-pulse\nregion of the pulse profile. The flux density is\nthen obtained by multiplying the pulse profile by\nthe ratio of radiometer noise to the standard deviation of the off-pulse phase and subtracting the\nmean off-pulse level. We have carried out this calculation for only the two bright phases, because\nthe emission in the weak phases disappeared much\nearlier (discussed in \u00a72.4 with more details). The\ncalculated flux densities in both bright phases on\nMJD 52997 (0.95(4) and 0.65(4) mJy for BP1 and\nBP2 at 820 MHz, respectively) are consistent with\nthe value that has been calculated by Lyne et al.\n(2004) (0\u22121.3(3) mJy at 1390 MHz). Fig. 7 shows\nthe mean flux densities of different epochs which\nhave been observed at 820 MHz. This confirms\nthat the flux density significantly decreases over\ntime and almost reaches zero around MJD 54852\nin both bright phases. The rate of decrease is calculated to be 0.177(6) and 0.089(7) mJy yr\u22121 for\nBP1 and BP2, respectively. The flux densities of\nthe last few epochs are only upper limits (denoted\n\n2.3.\n\nAnalysis and comparison of light\ncurves of the two bright phases\n\nThe orbital-phase binned light curves of the two\nbright phases were obtained by integrating the flux\nin a window covering 5% of the spin period and\ncentered on the pulse peak to reduce the effect of\nbaseline noise. Then each light curve is smoothed\nby using a boxcar with a width of 30 pulses to\nreduce the significant pulse-to-pulse modulation.\nIn Figs. 8 and 9, we present the light curves of the\ntwo bright phases on 12 different days that have\nbeen observed at frequency 820 MHz. Initially in\nboth bright phases the emission was detected in a\nregion covering \u223c 30\u25e6 of orbital phase, but this has\nshrunk over time, although this did not happen\nsymmetrically in both phases.\nIn order to analyze the evolution of the two\nbright phases with time, we calculated the start\nand end orbital longitudes, at the 10% of the\nmaximum, of BP1 and BP2. These are shown\nin Fig. 10. The linear least-squares fits show the\nstart of BP1 moves to higher longitudes at a rate\nof 3.1(4)\u25e6 yr\u22121 and the end of BP1 moves backwards at a rate of \u22121.4(4)\u25e6 yr\u22121 . In BP2, the both\nstart and end orbital longitudes move to higher\nvalues at a rate of 4.1(2)\u25e6 yr\u22121 and 2.1(2)\u25e6 yr\u22121 .\nThese rates show that BP1 and BP2 shrink at a\nrate of 4.5(6)\u25e6 yr\u22121 and 2.1(3)\u25e6 yr\u22121 , respectively.\nThe above rates are updates for those presented by\n\n4\n\n\fBurgay et al. (2005). These results confirmed that\nthe disappearance did not happen symmetrically.\nHowever, the disappearance did occur simultaneously in both bright phase regions.\n2.4.\n\nwork to model the 2-D pulse profile of a precessing pulsar by using a simple circular hollowcone beam. They applied this model for PSR\nB1913+16 to explain its long term pulse profile\nevolution. To represent the different intensity levels of the emission beam, they constructed a set of\ncoaxial circular hollow cones with different angular radii. Each circular cone represents a different\nintensity level. The outermost cone represents the\nlowest intensity level. The intensities gradually increase towards the maximum-intensity-level cone\ncone somewhere between the outermost cone and\nthe center of the beam, and then decrease until\nreaching the center of the beam. With this special\nconstruction of the beam, it is possible to explain\nthe hour-glass or oval shapes of the 2-D pulse profiles.\nMoreover, this model constrains the geometrical parameters of the precessing pulsar. Mainly,\nthe model predicts the longitudinal separation\n(i.e., pulse width) at a given epoch for a given\nintensity level for some set of geometrical parameters. Then we fit this model-predicted width to\nthe corresponding observed-pulse-profile width for\na range of intensity levels to obtain the geometrical parameters.\nFirst we used the hollow-cone beam shape in\norder to determine the geometry of the B pulsar.\nThen we used a more complicated elliptical horseshoe shaped beam, filled with different intensity\nlevels as in the circular beam construction, to constrain the geometry and found that this fit our\nobservations better.\nIn both cases, the required pulse-width data at\ndifferent intensity levels of the pulse profiles have\nbeen calculated by fitting Gaussians to the profiles\nand then calculating the pulse widths at different\nintensity levels of the fitted Gaussian curves. The\nmodeling has been done for the two bright phases\nseparately to constrain two sets of geometrical parameters.\n\nAnalysis of the two weak phases\n\nWeak radio emission has been detected in two\norbital phase ranges in addition to the two bright\nphases. One of the two weak emission regions,\n340\u25e6 \u221230\u25e6 (hereafter WP1) is much brighter than\nthe other, 80\u25e6 \u2212130\u25e6 (hereafter WP2), and is detectable until 2007 November (MJD 54429) (see\nFig. 11). WP2 vanished in 2006 February (MJD\n53783), more than a year before the disappearance\nof the WP1 (see Fig. 12). In general, both weak\nphases show a unimodal pulse profile and no dramatic pulse shape changes over time. Some data\nshow two apparent peaks in their pulse profile, but\nthe lower signal-to-noise makes it difficult to model\nthese in the same way as for the bright phases (e.g.\non MJD 53702 in WP1 and 53701 in WP2). If the\nevolution is solely due to relativistic spin precession, we would expect the same profile evolution\nfor all phases. However, the emission may not be\nstrong enough in the weak phases to detect the\nsecond profile component. For instance, at MJD\n54113 the brightness of the second brightest component of BP1 is 30% of the brightest component\nand that of BP2 is 67%. In comparison, the rootmean-square noise in WP1 is almost 50% of the\npulse maximum, making it difficult to detect the\nsecond peak of the profile. Therefore, within the\nuncertainties, the component separation evolution\nmay be similar for bright and weak phase profiles.\nWe calculated the mean flux densities of both\nweak phase regions (see Fig. 13). In these phases,\nthe mean flux densities are lower than that of\nbright phases. The decreasing rates of the mean\nflux densities are calculated to be 0.032(8) and\n0.02(2) mJy yr\u22121 for WP1 and WP2, respectively.\nThe larger uncertainty of the data points results\nin the poor quality of the fits. However, due to the\nweakness of the pulse emission in WP1 and WP2,\nwe only use the two bright phase regions for our\nmodeling.\n3.\n\n3.1.\n\nModeling the geometry with a circular hollow-cone beam\n\nIn this section, we use a circular hollow-cone\nbeam and the same set of equations as in CW08\nto determine the two angles \u03b1 and \u03b8, which are\nthe magnetic inclination (i.e. angle between spin\naxis and magnetic dipole moment) and the colati-\n\nDetermining the Geometry of the system\nClifton & Weisberg (2008) proposed a frame-\n\n5\n\n\fgiven time, with the subscript j specifying the intensity level of the profile. The line-of-sight vector,\nn\u0302(t), can be expressed as in equation (3) of CW08\nand nx (t) and ny (t) in the above equation are the\nX and Y components of n\u0302(t). The third variable,\n\u03b7j (t), is the angle which is subtended at the origin of the coordinate system due to the encounter\nof the line-of-sight vector with the elliptical beam;\nnamely, it is the angle between the line joining the\norigin with the point at which the line-of-sight vector encounters the beam and the line joining the\norigin with the center of the elliptical beam (see\nFig. 16). Thus, amending the expression of CW08\nfor an elliptical beam, \u03b7j (t) can be expressed as\n\ntude of the spin axis (i.e. angle between spin axis\nand orbital angular momentum), respectively (see\nFig. 14 (a)). The model also includes another parameter, T0 , the epoch for which the precession\nphase is equal to zero. The fit of the width at\ndifferent intensity levels of our data to the model\nis shown in Fig. 15. The fit has been done by\nminimizing the chi-square statistic over the entire parameter space of the two angles (\u03b1:[0,\u03c0],\n\u03b8:[0,\u03c0]) and T0 :[1930,2001]. This range of dates\nencompasses one full precessional cycle for pulsar B. The required errors of the data points for\nthe chi-square statistic are obtained by the fitted\nGaussians, which are the same for a given epoch\nat different intensity levels.\nThe best-fit results\nfor the two angles\nfor BP1\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u25e6 +1.5\nare \u03b1 = 80.0\u25e6 +1.5\nand\n\u03b8\n=\n20.0\n,\nwhile\nfor\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u221215.0\n\u221216.5\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u25e6 +1.5\n\u25e6 +1.0\nBP2 \u03b1 = 78.0 \u221211.0\u25e6 and \u03b8 = 20.0 \u221212.5\u25e6 . A secondary peak in the PDFs caused large errors for\nthe best fit parameters at their 68.5% confidence\ninterval. The fits estimate T0 = 1959.4(1) yr for\nboth phases. These best fit values are very different from those in Breton et al. (2008), who determined \u03b1 = 70.9(4)\u25e6 and \u03b8 = 130.0(4)\u25e6 (see Table 2). In addition to this, the simple circular\nbeam shape predicts a disappearance in \u223c 2018\ninstead of 2008. Due to the poor fit and the inability to explain the disappearance of the radio\nemission in 2008, we experimented with other possible beam shapes.\n3.2.\n\n\u0002 n2 (t) + sin2 \u03b1 \u2212 [n(t) \u2212 sin \u03b1]2 [1 \u2212 Rj2 ] + b2j \u0003\n\u03b7j (t) = acos\n2n(t) sin \u03b1\n(2)\nwhere Rj = bj /aj and aj and bj are the semimajor and semi-minor axes of the elliptical beam\nfor a given intensity level. They can take different\nvalues corresponding to the intensity levels of the\nbeam in a way such that aj /bj , or the ellipticity\nof the beam, is a constant.\nThe horse-shoe shaped beam is a subsection\nof the elliptical beam. We can construct this by\nrestricting the detectable area of the beam to a\nsection of the elliptical beam, with r1 and r2 the\nradial distances on the X-Y plane of the elliptical beam within which emission is detectable (see\nFig. 14 (b)). Simply, we can detect the emission beam of the pulsar only when sin \u03b1 + r1 <\np\n[nx (t)]2 + [ny (t)]2 < sin \u03b1 + r2 , where nx (t) and\nny (t) are the X and Y components of n\u0302(t).\nThe fit has been done for the two bright phases\nseparately by searching over the entire parameter space for the two angles \u03b1 and \u03b8 and the\nratio a/b using a likelihood analysis (see, e.g.,\nMcLaughlin & Cordes (2000)). First the individual likelihood of each data point was calculated by assuming a Gaussian distribution such\nthat the likelihood for model \u0398 and measurement i is Li (\u0398) = (2\u03c0\u03c3i2 )\u22121/2 exp(\u2212(wmodel,i \u2212\nwmeasured,i )2 /2\u03c3i2 ), where wmodel,i and wmeasured,i\nare the model and measured widths and \u03c3i is the\nerror on the measured width. We then multiplied\nall Li (\u0398) for all data points i (i.e. profiles from\nall epochs and at all intensity levels) to get the\ntotal likelihood L(\u0398) for parameter combination\n\nModeling the geometry with an elliptical horse-shoe shaped beam\n\nIn this case, we used an elliptical hollow-cone\nfilled beam with different intensity levels and then\nassumed that only a part of this beam is detectable, resulting in a horse-shoe shaped beam.\nTo simplify the geometry, we assumed that the\nbeam shape is fixed with respect to the neutron\nstar and it rotates around the spin axis in a way\nsuch that the semi-major axis is always aligned in\nthe radially outward direction from the spin axis\n(see Fig. 16). In order to model this particular\nshape, we derived an equation for the profile width\nq\n[nx (t)]2 + [ny (t)]2 sin \u03b7j (t)],\n(1)\nwhere wj (t) is the width of the pulse profile at a\nwj (t) = arcsin[2\n\n6\n\n\frecently, CW08 revisited the problem with a different geometrical framework using the circular\nbeam approximation.\nWe used the CW08 model in order to constrain\nthe geometry of pulsar B. First we used the circular hollow-cone beam shape they proposed in their\npaper and estimated the geometrical parameters \u03b1\nand \u03b8 by fitting our data. The best fit values are\ndifferent from the measurements of Breton et al.\n(2008) and the fit is poor. It is likely that the discrepancy between our best-fit geometry and that\nof Breton et al. (2008), as well as the inability of\nthe CW08 to fully explain our data, are due to a\nnon-circular emission beam shape for pulsar B.\nIn \u00a73.2, we modified the geometrical framework of CW08 with an elliptical hollow-cone beam\nshape. This produced a much better fit than the\ncircular beam. Furthermore, the two angles \u03b1 and\n\u03b8 are consistent in the two bright phases and with\nthe predictions of Breton et al. (2008) (see Table 2). To obtain the disappearance in 2008, the\ndetectable area of the beam has to be restricted to\na section of the elliptical beam, producing a horseshoe shaped beam. Given this model, we calculate\nthe ratio of the semi-major and semi-minor axes\n+0.27\n(a/b) to be 1.72+0.12\n\u22120.20 and 1.15\u22120.22 for BP1 and\nBP2, respectively. After transforming this ratio\nto the assumed unit sphere by dividing by cos(\u03b1),\nwe estimate the ellipticity of the radio beam of B\nin the two bright phases separately: 0.9(1) and\n0.9(2) at BP1 and BP2, respectively. The ratio\nr1 /r2 in the two bright phases reveals that only\n29(6)% of the beam area was detectable in BP1\nand only 21(5)% in BP2. The different estimates\nfor the effective area of the beam in the two bright\nphases show that the emission beam may have different orientations corresponding to the different\norbital phases. The characteristic pulse shapes are\nalso different at different orbital phases. This is a\ndirect consequence of the influence of pulsar A's\nwind on the emission beam of pulsar B (see, e.g.,\nLyutikov (2004)).\nThe special choice of the beam construction\nwith different intensity levels explains the singlepeaked to double-peaked pulse profile evolution.\nOn the first day, MJD 52997, the observed bright\nsingle-peaked pulse profile can be explained as\nour line-of-sight just grazing the outer edge of\nthe maximum intensity level of the beam. When\nthe line-of-sight gradually moves inward with time\n\n\u0398. Ltot , the total likelihood over all parameter\ncombinations, was calculated by summing all the\nlikelihoods over all parameter combinations. Then\nthe posterior probability distributions for parameter values were calculated by dividing the likelihoods for a particular parameter value by the total\nlikelihood Ltot , assuming flat prior probability distributions. The best fit 2-D pulse profile is shown\nin Fig. 17 and the posterior probabilities of the\nthree parameters \u03b1, \u03b8, and a/b for BP1 are shown\nin Fig. 18.\nThe fitting constrained\nthe two angles \u25e6for BP1\n\u25e6\nto be \u03b1 = 65.0\u25e6 +2.0\nand\n\u03b8 = 134.5\u25e6+1.5\n\u25e6\n\u22121.0\n\u22126.0\u25e6 , while\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u25e6 +1.4\nfor BP2 \u03b1 = 73.0 \u22123.5\u25e6 and \u03b8 = 138.5\u25e6 +4.0\n\u22127.5\u25e6 . We\nexpect the same estimates for the two angles in\nboth bright phases, indicating that our errors are\nunderestimated or the model may not fit the data\nperfectly. These angles are similar to those derived\nby Breton et al. (2008) (see Table 2). The best-fit\nestimate of the ratio of the beam semi-major and\n+0.27\nsemi-minor axes (a/b) is 1.72+0.12\n\u22120.20 and 1.15\u22120.22\nfor BP1 and BP2, respectively. Because of the\nvarying influence of A, the magnetosphere could\nhave different shapes at different orbital phases,\nand these angles could in fact differ. In order to\ncause the disappearance in 2008, the ratio r1 /r2\nhas to be 0.70 and 0.48 for BP1 and BP2, respectively. The parameter T0 is 1950.3(1) yr for both\nbright phases. Since the spin axis takes 75 yr to\nprecess a full cycle around the orbital angular momentum axis, the year 2008, within which disappearance occurred, is not a special year relative to\nthis estimated T0 .\n4.\n\nDiscussion\n\nPulse profile changes have been detected in\nseveral other double neutron star systems: PSR\nB1913+16 (Weisberg et al. 1989; Kramer 1998;\nWeisberg & Taylor 2005), B1534+12 (Arzoumanian\n1996; Stairs et al. 2004), J1141\u22126545 (Hotan et al.\n2005; Manchester et al. 2010), and J1906+0746\n(Lorimer et al. 2006). In these pulsars, the longterm pulse profile evolution has been interpreted\nas the variation of the radio beam orientation\nwith respect to our line-of-sight due to geodetic\nprecession. Kramer (1998) demonstrated a fully\nconsistent model for PSR B1913+16 assuming a\ncircular hollow-cone beam geometry and the precession rate predicted by general relativity.

However, the observed decreasing\nflux density over time cannot be explained by either model, since the intensity is constant along\nthe cross-section of a hollow cone of the conical\nbeam, in both the circular or elliptical cases. We\nbelieve the observed decrease in flux density must\nbe due to a gradient in brightness across the beam\nor due to the changing influence of A on B during the span of these data. The distance between\nthe two pulsars changes over time relative to our\nline-of-sight due to the relativistic advance of periastron of 17\u25e6 yr\u22121 of the system. This results in\na different amount of impact on B's emission by A\nwith respect to Earth and leads to a change in the\nshape of the horse-shoe beam slightly, but this is\nlikely a small effect, and not easy to model. Thus\nwe ignored this effect.\nThe data show that the pulse profile had two\npeaks when the disappearance occurred in 2008\nand clearly did not become a single peak before\nthe disappearance. The horse-shoe shaped beam\nmodel can explain this phenomenon qualitatively,\nas the line-of-sight moved out of the elongated side\nof the beam (i.e. the two opened arms of the horseshoe beam, see Fig. 14 (b)). This results in the\ndisappearance of both peaks of the pulse profiles\nin both bright phases simultaneously. The reappearance of the emission of pulsar B is predicted to\noccur in \u223c 2035, according to the horse-shoe beam\nmodel, assuming emission from the same part of\nthe beam. This is because our line-of-sight encounters the emission beam twice during the time\nthat the spin axis rotates around the orbital angular momentum axis once (\u223c71 yr). This can\nbe understood by visualizing the geometry of the\n\n\u03b8(\u25e6 )\n20.0(\u221216.5,+1.5)\n20.0(\u221212.5,+1.0)\n134.5(\u22126.0,+1.5)\n138.5(\u22127.5,+4.0)\n130.0(\u22120.4,+0.4)\n\nemission beam with two angles, \u03b1 \u2248 65\u25e6 and \u03b8 \u2248\n130\u25e6 . Thus the spin axis of the pulsar B is below\nthe inclination plane and the magnetic moment\naxis crosses the inclination plane twice during every 2.8 sec period. Since the inclination plane of\nthe system is almost edge-on with respect to the\nEarth, we are able to detect the emission beam\ntwice during the 71 yr period. Geodetic precession along with the unique geometry of the system is responsible for this phenomenon. Note that\nthis prediction for the reappearance time is only\nvalid assuming a single horse-shoe emission component. If the beam is symmetric, with two horseshoe shaped emission components separated by a\ngap, then we would expect a reappearance around\n2014. Because we have only sampled a limited\npart of the beam, it is impossible to know what\nthe true intensity distribution of B's beam is at\nthis point.\nDespite the unusual modulation of B's emission by A, the 3-5% duty cycle of B's pulse and\nthe pulse profile shapes throughout the evolution\nare similar to those of pulsars with similar periods, with the dramatic geodetic precession of B\noffering us the chance to sample a much larger\nportion of the beam than typically possible. It\nis difficult to determine what is responsible for\nB's flux density variation. It may be that most\npulsars have instrinisic intensity variations across\ntheir beams. Or, the decrease in the intensity of\nB's emission with time may be solely due to B's\nmagnetosphere shape changing with the varying\ninfluence of A. Theoretical modeling of the influence of A's wind with time is necessary to address\nthis. Our horse-shoe shaped beam fits the standard conal emission model Rankin (1983), with\nthe observed single to double peak evolution due\nto sampling different lines-of-sight across the con-\n\n8\n\n\fical beam, but this model does not explain the\ndecreasing flux density and eventual disappearance of the pulsar. Pulse profile shapes have\nalso been explained through the 'patchy' beam\nmodel (Lyne & Manchester 1988) in which intensities across the beam vary widely and often only\na portion of the cone is visible. Observations\nof relativistic binary pulsar system J1141\u22126545\n(Manchester et al. 2010) show that the emission\nacross the beam is asymmetric with respect to the\nmagnetic axis, consistent with a patchy beam. It\nis more difficult to interpret the evolution of B's\nprofile with the patchy beam model, however, unless the patches are large enough to explain both\ncomponents disappearing at the same time. Continued monitoring and sensitive searches for emission from B will provide invaluable information on\nthe true beam shape of this pulsar.\nLyutikov (2005) proposed a model to explain\nthe change in the orbital longitudes of the two\nbright phases. It relies on the wind of pulsar A\naffecting the direction of emission of pulsar B and\nmaking it miss our line of sight for most of the\norbit. In this model, the two bright phase regions evolve as a decreasing or increasing orbital\nphase gap between the two regions according to\nthe direction of the spin precession (see Fig. 6 of\nLyutikov 2005). However, the light curves of the\ntwo phases show that the real situation is somewhat different (see Fig. 10). Motion of the ending\norbital phase of BP1 to lower phases and starting orbital phase of BP2 to higher phases result in\nan increase in the orbital phase gap between the\nbright regions instead of the motion of both the\nstarting and the ending phases that is predicted\nby the model. We are working on a more quantitative model in order to explain the evolution and\nthe disappearance of B's emission.\n\nBoerner, G., Ehlers, J., & Rudolph, E. 1975, A&A,\n44, 417\nBreton, R.

Each profile covers 20 min of orbital longitude (from\n185\u25e6 \u2212235\u25e6) and there are 256 bins across the entire profile. Since predictions of absolute pulse phase are not\navailable for these observations, the highest profile peak has been aligned to phase 0.5 at each epoch. The\nhorizontal solid and dotted lines show the baseline, or off-pulse mean, of the profile and the corresponding\nstandard deviation of the off-peak region, respectively. The effective time resolution of the profiles is 0.01\nsec.\n\n11\n\n\fFig. 2.- As described in Fig. 1, but for BP2.\n\nFig. 3.- Grey\u2212scale plots of BP1 (left) and BP2 (right). There are 256 bins across each pulse profile. The\nfirst peak of each pulse profile has been normalized to unity and aligned to visualize how the second peak\nevolves. The discontinuities of the plots are artifacts due to boundary level changes.\n\n12\n\n\fFig. 4.- Full width at half max (FWHM) of the first peak of BP1 (left) and the second peak of BP1\n(right). The linear least-squares fits show a decreasing FWHM rate of 0.59(8)\u25e6 yr\u22121 for the first peak and\nincreasing FWHM rate of 0.4(3)\u25e6 yr\u22121 for the second peak.\n\nFig. 5.- FWHM of the first peak of BP2 (left) and that of second peak of BP2 (right). The linear leastsquares fits show a decreasing FWHM rate of 0.8(2)\u25e6 yr\u22121 and 1.7(2)\u25e6 yr\u22121 for the first and second peak,\nrespectively. Note that due to the small number of bright pulses included in these composite profiles, the\nprofiles show a high amount of variability that does not follow any trend.\n\nFig. 6.- The varying separation of the two peaks of pulse profiles of BP1 (left) and BP2 (right). The linear\nleast-squares fits show a separation rate of 2.6(1)\u25e6 yr\u22121 and 2.6(2)\u25e6 yr\u22121 for BP1 and BP2, respectively.\nNote that in BP1, the two-peak pulse profile lasts longer than in BP2.\n\n13\n\n\fFig. 7.- Mean flux density of the radio emission in BP1 (left) and in BP2 (right). The data marked by\nthe arrows are the upper limits and ignored in our linear least-squares fit. The decreasing rate of the mean\nflux density is calculated to be 0.177(6) and 0.089(7) mJy yr\u22121 for BP1 and BP2, respectively.\n\nFig. 8.- The light curves of BP1 on 12 different days at an observing frequency of 820 MHz. Each data set\nhas been cleaned to get rid of radio frequency interference. All light curves have been smoothed by using a\nboxcar averaging technique with a width of 30 pulses. The horizontal solid and dotted lines show the baseline\nof the plot and the corresponding standard deviation of the off-peak region (140\u25e6 \u2212180\u25e6 and 240\u25e6\u2212260\u25e6 ),\nrespectively. The last data set shows just noise.\n\n14\n\n\fFig. 9.- As in Fig. 8, but for BP2.\n\nFig. 10.- Evolution of the start and end orbital longitudes of BP1 and BP2, measured at the 10% of the\nmaximum.\n\n15\n\n\fFig. 11.- As in Fig. 1, but for WP1. Each profile covers 20 min of orbital longitude (from 340\u25e6 \u221230\u25e6 ) and\nthere are 256 bins across the entire profile.\n\nFig. 12.- As in Fig. 1, but for WP2 covering 20 min of orbital longitude (from 80\u25e6 \u2212130\u25e6). The pulsar is\nweaker during this phase than during WP1.\n\n16\n\n\fFig. 13.- Mean flux density of the radio emission in WP1 (left) and in WP2 (right). The data marked by\nthe arrows are the upper limits and ignored in our linear least-squares fits. The decreasing rate of the mean\nflux density is calculated to be 0.032(8) and 0.02(2) mJy yr\u22121 for WP1 and WP2, respectively.\n^\n\n^\n\n\u03a9 spin ,Z\n\n^\n\nY\n\nr2\n\nTrajectory of the\nline\u2212of\u2212sight\n^\nn(t)\n\nPartially filled\nelliptical beam\nwith\ndifferent\nr1\nintensity levels\n\n^\n\u03bc\n\nsin\n\n(\u03b1)\n\nUnit sphere\n\n\u03b1\n\u03b8 i\n\n^\n\n^\n\nX\n\nX\n\n^\n\n\u03a9 orbit\n\n^\n\u2212Y\n\nTrajectory of the\nmagnetic axis\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 14.- Geometry of pulsar B with its spin and the precession in a Cartesian coordinate system with a\nunit sphere at the center; all of the trajectories move on this sphere. (a) The coordinate system is chosen\nwith the Z-axis parallel to the spin-axis of the pulsar (\u03a9\u0302spin ) with the X-axis in the plane of the spin-axis and\nthe orbital angular momentum axis (\u03a9\u0302orbit ); i.e., the \u03a9\u0302spin and the \u03a9\u0302orbit are always in the X-Z plane. The\npulsar-earth line-of-sight is n\u0302(t) and dashes represent the conical trajectory of it on the unit sphere about\n\u03a9\u0302orbit due to geodetic precession. Dots represent the conical trajectory of the co-rotating magnetic field (\u03bc\u0302)\non the unit sphere about \u03a9\u0302spin due to the pulsar spin. The inclination of the orbit is i. The colatitude\nof spin axis and the misalignment of the magnetic field are \u03b8 and \u03b1, respectively. (b) The projections of\ntrajectories of \u03bc\u0302 and n\u0302(t) on the X-Y plane. Dash-dot lines represent the different intensity levels of the\nelliptical beam. The intensity increases gradually from the outer most edge of the beam to inwards until the\nmaximum intensity level (the solid line of the beam), and then decreases towards the center of the beam.\nThe lightly shaded region represents the detectable beam area when the beam sweeps about the spin axis.\nThis area is determined from the radial lengths r1 and r2 , and they are measured from the center of the beam\non the X-Y plane. With this restriction, the effective beam has a horse-shoe shape and it is represented as\nthe dark shaded region. Dashes show the trajectory of the n\u0302(t) on the X-Y plane. When n\u0302(t) crosses the\nbeam area (lightly shaded area), we are able to detect the pulsar.\n17\n\n\fFig. 15.- The hour-glass shaped two-dimensional pulse profile of PSR\nJ0737\u22123039B, assuming\na circular\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u25e6 +1.5\n(left),\nand for\nand\n\u03b8\n=\n20.0\nhollow-cone beam.

Fitting has been done by searching the entire range\nof the two angles. The dots are the widths at equal intensity of the pulse profile. Each horizontal row of\ndots represents an observation at a given epoch. Equal-intensity contours are produced from the emission of\nthe circular symmetric conical beam. The solid lines are the equal intensity level of the peaks of two-peak\npulse profile. The intensity increases from the inner dashed line outwards until the first solid line, which is\nthe intensity of the peak, and then decreases outwards again. The intensity levels are, from inner dashed\nline, 80%, 90%, 100%, 90%, 80%, 70%, 60% and 50%. The vertical axis is calibrated in years, and can also\nbe considered the spin precession phase, which increases linearly with time. The time of precessional phase\nzero in the fits is T0 = 1959.41 yr for both phases. We have omitted the data between MJDs 53175 and\n53939. During this time, the profile was bi-modal but the separation between the peaks was small, making\nit difficult to measure widths at different intensity levels.\n\n18\n\n\f^\nY\n\n^\nn(t)\n\nA constant intensity\nlevel of the elliptical\nbeam at a given time\n\naj\n\n\u03b7(t)\n\nsin (\n\nj\n\n\u03b1)\n\nbj\n\norigin of the\ncoordinate\nsystem\n\n^\nX\nTrajectory of the\nline\u2212of\u2212sight\n\nFig. 16.- A zoomed-in view of the elliptical beam on the X-Y plane with a constant intensity level. The\ngiven constant intensity level crosses our line-of-sight when the line-of-sight is within the effective beam area\n(lightly shaded area in Fig 14(b)). The semi-major and semi-minor axes, aj and bj , can take any value\ncorresponding to the intensity level in a way such that the ratio aj /bj is a constant. After projecting to the\nX-Y plane, the semi-major axis is aligned in the radially outward direction from the spin axis. sin(\u03b1) is the\ndistance to the center of the beam from the spin axis on the X-Y plane. \u03b7j (t) is defined also on the X-Y\nplane, and it is the angle between the line joining the origin with the point at which the line-of-sight (n\u0302(t))\nencounters the constant intensity level of the beam and the line joining the spin axis with the center of the\nelliptical beam.\n\n19\n\n\fFig. 17.- The two-dimensional pulse profile of PSR\nJ0737\u22123039B,\nassuming a horse-shoe shaped beam.\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n+0.12\n\u25e6 +1.5\n,\n,\n\u03b8\n=\n134.5\nThe best fit parameters for BP1 are \u03b1 = 65.0\u25e6 +2.0\n\u22126.0\u25e6 and a/b = 1.72\u22120.20 (left).
