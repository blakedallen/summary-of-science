Introduction\nThe dynamics of the pendulum or systems containing the pendulum is probably one of the oldest scientific\ntopics. Simple parametrically excited pendulum shows extremely complex behaviour [1, 2]. Miles [3] shows\nthat for the pendulum the route to chaos leads through symmetry breaking pitchfork bifurcation and cascades\nof period doubling bifurcations. Comprehensive analytical investigation of the pendulum with different\nforcing was presented by Bryant and Miles [4, 5, 6]. In the forced system one can consider two main\nparameters: the amplitude and the frequency of excitation. Such a bifurcation diagram for parametrically\nforced pendulum with horizontally moving point of the suspension was presented by Bishop and Clifford for\nperiodic oscillations (PO) [7] and for periodic rotations (PR) [8]. In [9] bifurcation analysis was extended\nto elliptic movement of suspension point both for PO and PR. The analytical investigation of oscillating\nand rotating motions of pendulum was done using averaging, small parameter, harmonic balance, and other\nmethods[10, 13, 14, 7, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. This analysis allows understanding of the pendulum dynamics\nin the neighbourhood of the locked periodic solutions. The interesting effect can be observed when the\nsymmetry of the pendulum is broken, i.e., the imperfection term is added to the potential function [20]. In\nsuch an asymmetric system the symmetry breaking pitchfork bifurcation disappears and the sudden decrease\nof the amplitude of the PO at the first period doubling bifurcation can be regarded as a precursor of an\nescape or problems with system's behaviour.\nThe crucial point in modelling of such systems is a good approximation of damping coefficients (viscous\nand frictional damping). There are well known methods for linear [11, 12] systems but as far as the pendulum\nis oscillating with large amplitude, the linear approximation does not give sufficient results. This problem\nhas been solved by Xu et al. [21, 22]. They show an efficient method to extract the damping coefficients\n(viscous damping and dry friction) from time series of freely oscillating pendulum and consider the influence\nof the shaker (the source of the forcing).\nMost previous works on the dynamics of the pendulum suspended on the forced oscillator consider the\nlinear oscillators. Such a system can be considered as a modification of the classical tuned mass absorber\n\u2217 Corresponding\n\nauthor\nEmail address: przemyslaw.perlikowski@p.lodz.pl (P. Perlikowski)\n\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier\n\nJuly 12, 2012\n\n\f[23, 24]. Early works [25, 26] give approximate results by the method of harmonic balance in the primary\nparametric instability zone, which allows calculation of the separate regions of stable and unstable harmonic\nsolutions. Further analysis allows understanding of the dynamics around primary and secondary resonances\n[27, 28, 29, 30, 31]. In the recent work Ikeda proposed the usage of two pendulums mounted in the same\npivot as a tuned mass absorber [37]. His experimental results show good agreement with the numerical\nsimulations and his model can be considered as a good alternative to one pendulum on the pivot in the\ndesign of tuned mass absorbers.\nA good understanding of dynamics of tuned mass absorber with linear base system gives possibility to\nextend investigation to systems with non\u2013linear base. Non\u2013linearity in considered class of systems is usually\nintroduced by changing the linear spring into non\u2013linear one [32, 33] or magnetorheological damper [34]. In\na few papers on this topic one can find an analytical study of the dynamics of Duffing \u2013 pendulum systems\naround principal and secondary resonances [30, 32, 33, 35, 36]. The main conclusion coming from the above\nmentioned papers is that non-linear spring in the base system causes enlargement of parameters range where\npendulum can be used as a tune mass absorber.\nIn this paper we consider the pendulum suspended on the forced non\u2013linear Duffing oscillator. The\npurpose of our analysis is to study the emergence and the stability of PO and PR in two parameters space:\nthe amplitude and the frequency of excitation. We identify the regions with one stable periodic solution,\nseveral coexisting periodic solutions, quasi-periodicity, and chaotic behaviour.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we formulate the dimensionless equations of motion.\nThe possible scenarios of pendulum's destabilization are presented in Section 3. Section 4 shows twodimensional bifurcation diagrams for PO, PR, as well as one-parameter continuations for representative\nvalues of parameters. The influence of non\u2013linearity of spring on absorbing properties of the pendulum is\nstudied as well. In Section 5 we show the regions in two-dimensional parameter space where one, two, or\nseveral coexisted attractors can be observed. Finally, in Section 6 we summarize our results.\n2. Model of the system\nThe analyzed system is shown in Fig. 1. It consists of a Duffing oscillator with a suspended pendulum.\nThe Duffing system is forced by periodical excitation and moving in a vertical direction. The position of\nmass M is given by coordinate y and the angular displacement of pendulum (position of the mass m) is\ngiven by angle \u03c6. The equations of motion can be derived using Lagrange equations of the second type. The\nkinetic energy T , potential energy V , and Rayleigh dissipation D are given respectively by the following\nequations:\n1\n1\n(1)\nT = (M + m)\u1e8f 2 \u2212 ml\u1e8f\u03c6\u0307 sin \u03c6 + ml2 \u03c6\u03072 ,\n2\n2\nV =\n\n1\n1\nk1 y 2 + k2 y 4 + mgl(1 \u2212 cos \u03c6),\n2\n4\n\n(2)\n\n1\nc1 \u1e8f 2 ,\n(3)\n2\nwhere M is mass of the Duffing oscillator, m is mass of the pendulum, l is length of the pendulum, k1 and\nk2 are linear and non\u2013linear parts of spring stiffness, and c1 is a viscous damping coefficient of the Duffing\noscillator. The generalized forces are given by the following formula:\nD=\n\nQ = F (t)\n\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202y\n+ T q (\u03c6\u0307)\n,\n\u2202y\n\u2202\u03c6\n\n(4)\n\nwhere F (t) = F0 cos \u03bdt is a periodically varying excitation with amplitude F and frequency \u03bd, T q (\u03c6\u0307) = c2 \u03c6\u0307\nis a damping torque with damping coefficient c2 . The damper of pendulum is located in a pivot of the\npendulum (not shown in Fig. 1). The damping in the pivot of pendulum is composed of viscous and dry\nfriction damping [21]. Here we neglect dry friction component (to have a continuous system) and assume\nsmall value of viscous part (1% of critical damping).\n2\n\n\fk1 y +k2 y 3\n\nc1 y\nF(t)\n\nM\nT( \u03c6)\n\ny\n\nl\n\u03c6\nmo\nFigure 1: Model of system.\n\nOne can derive two coupled second order differential equations:\n(M + m)\u00ff \u2212 ml\u03c6\u0308 sin \u03c6 \u2212 ml\u03c6\u03072 cos \u03c6 + k1 y + k2 y 3 + c1 \u1e8f = F0 cos \u03bdt,\n\n(5)\n\nml2 \u03c6\u0308 \u2212 ml\u00ff sin \u03c6 + mlg sin \u03c6 + c2 \u03c6\u0307 = 0.\n\n(6)\n\nIn the numerical\n\u0002 N \u0003 calculations\u0002we\n\u0003 use the following\n\u0002 \u0003 values of Duffing oscillator's parameters: M = 5.0 [kg],\nN\nk1 = 162.0 m\n, k2 = 502.0 m\n, c1 = 3.9 Ns\nand the following values of the pendulum's parameters:\nm\nm = 0.5 [kg], l = 0.1 [m], c2 = 0.001 [Nms].

Both subsystems (Duffing oscillator and the pendulum) have linear resonance\nfor \u03bc = 1.0, so around this value we expect the appearance of the complex dynamics. Amplitude f and\nfrequency \u03bc of the excitation are taken as control parameters.\n3. Destabilization of pendulum\nSystem (7) possesses three qualitatively different regimes. The first one is the regime when the oscillations\nof the Duffing system are not large enough to destabilize the pendulum. Hence, the pendulum is at stable\nsteady state \u03b3 = 0. The second regime appears when pendulum destabilizes and starts oscillating. The third\nregime is characterized by the rotating motions of the pendulum. The transition from the stable quiescence\nstate \u03b3 = 0 to oscillations can be understood from the theoretical point of view as the destabilization of the\ninvariant manifold \u03b3 = 0. Indeed, the manifold \u03b3 = \u03b3\u0307 = 0 is invariant with respect to (7) and the dynamics\non the manifold is described by the single Duffing oscillator:\n\u1e8d0 + x0 + \u03b1x30 + d1 \u1e8b0 = f cos \u03bc\u03c4,\n3\n\n(8)\n\n\fwith an effective mass m + M . The linear stability of motions on this manifold is given by the variational\nequation:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u03b4\u03b3\u0308 + d2 \u03b4 \u03b3\u0307 + 1 \u2212 \u1e8d0 (\u03c4 ) \u03b4\u03b3 = 0,\n(9)\nb\nwhich has form of a linear system with respect to the variation \u03b4\u03b3, perturbed periodically by the Duffing\nx0 (\u03c4 ). Such a parametrically perturbed system is known to possess destabilization regions (parametric\nresonance) when the frequency of the perturbation x0 (\u03c4 ) is rationally related to the frequency of the perturbation. Since in resonances zones the Duffing oscillator is usually locked 1 : 1 with the external frequency,\nwe expect the oscillation regions in the parameter space close to \u03bc \u2248 2 (the most prominent resonance) as\nwell as \u03bc \u2248 1/2, 1, 2/3, etc.\nAs a result of the destabilization of pendulum, PO appear, where x0 (\u03c4 ) is locked 1 : 1 to the external\nforce and \u03b3(\u03c4 ) to some other ratio depending on the resonance tongue. Since after the destabilization of\nthe pendulum, the emerged periodic solution still coexists with the unstable solution (\u03b3 = 0, x0 (\u03c4 )), we will\ncall it branching bifurcation. In Section 4 we develop a two-dimensional bifurcation diagram with respect\nto f and \u03bc. Branching bifurcations are shown as solid lines on this bifurcation diagram in Figs. 2(a,b)\ndelineating the resonance tongues.\n4. Two parameters continuation\nIn this section we present two bifurcation diagrams calculated in two-parameter space: amplitude f\nversus frequency \u03bc of excitation. We focus our attention on bifurcations of the pendulum. Duffing system,\ndue to excitation, is oscillating in the whole considered range of parameters. Such plots give an overview of\nsystem dynamics showing the most important periodic solutions, i.e., periodic solutions with significant area\nof existence. Our calculations have been performed using software for numerical continuation Auto07p [38].\nAs the starting points in our calculations, we use the steady state with f = 0.0 and follow it for different\nvalues of \u03bc detecting the bifurcations leading to different periodic motions. Moreover, in a few cases we start\nfrom periodic orbits calculated by the direct integration of eq. (7). For integration we use the fourth order\nRunge-Kutta method. The stability of periodic solutions is given by the set of Floquet multipliers [39].\n4.1. Oscillatory solutions in plane (f, \u03bc)\nIn Fig. 2(a) we show main resonances for which the pendulum is oscillating. Different colours of\nbifurcation lines indicate the borders of different resonances tongues, i.e., areas with different locking ratio\nbetween the pendulum and the excitation frequency. Duffing oscillator after branching bifurcation is always\nlocked 1 : 1 with excitation frequency, further bifurcations can change this ratio. The natural dimensionless\nfrequency of the pendulum and the Duffing oscillator are equal to one. We find the resonances with the\nfollowing locking rations: 1 : 1 (purple line), 1 : 2 (orange line), 2 : 1 (green line), 4 : 3 (blue line), 2 : 5\n(yellow line), and 2 : 3 (red line). These borders of the resonance tongues are of two kinds. Continuous lines\ncorrespond to the destabilization of the pendulum at the branching bifurcation and the appearance of PO\nwith oscillating pendulum, and dashed-dotted lines to saddle-node bifurcations of PO.\nResonance 4 : 3 appears in the saddle-node bifurcation and it is stable in a large range of parameters.\nOther resonances have qualitatively similar structure with three bifurcation curves meeting in one point:\ntwo solid lines and one dashed-dotted. The main resonant tongues (1 : 1 and 2 : 1) come very close to the\naxis f = 0 due to small friction. We illustrate the corresponding bifurcation scenarios in Fig. 2(c) using\none-dimensional bifurcation diagrams for the case of 2 : 1 resonance. Fig. 2(c) shows maximum amplitude of\nthe pendulum versus f for f \u2208 (0.0, 2.5) with fixed \u03bc = 1.9 and \u03bc = 2.1. Solid and dashed lines correspond\nto stable and unstable PO respectively. The black line indicates PO calculated for \u03bc = 1.9. As it is easy to\nsee, till f = 0.479 the pendulum is in hanging down position and only the Duffing system is oscillating. Then\nthrough the subcritical branching bifurcation PO (which corresponds to the oscillations of the pendulum)\nappears, but this branch of the PO is unstable (continuous line on the left side of the edge of the tongue\n(Fig. 2(a) indicate this bifurcation). For f = 0.043 the saddle-node bifurcation of PO takes place and\nthis branch of PO stabilizes.

Abbreviations: BB - branching bifurcation, NS - Neimark-Saker bifurcation,\nPF - symmetry breaking pitchfork bifurcation, SN - saddle-node bifurcation.\n\n5\n\n\fgenerating two asymmetric solutions. Both branches of PO originated from pitchfork bifurcation, destabilize\nin the subcritical period doubling bifurcations, in which the new unstable PO with doubled period is born.\nThis branch of PO stabilizes in the saddle-node bifurcation. Especially interesting is the situation shown\nin the enlargement in Fig. 2(c). One can see the coexistence of the 4 : 1 asymmetric PO (both Duffing\nand pendulum are quadruple) first with symmetric 2 : 1 PO and then after symmetry breaking pitchfork\nbifurcation of 2 : 1 resonance with two asymmetric 2 : 1 PO (after this bifurcation Duffing oscillator is\nlocked 2 : 1 with excitation - the same ratio as pendulum). Further increase of f for 4 : 1 asymmetric PO\nleads through the period doubling scenario to chaos. This bifurcation route shows that scenario described\nby Miles [3, 40] in the considered case of system (7) becomes more complicated.\nIn the same plot we present scenario for \u03bc = 2.1 (grey line) where the lower equilibrium position of the\npendulum is destabilized by the supercritical branching bifurcation for f = 0.524 (bifurcation takes place at\ncontinuous line on the right side of the edge of the tongue (see Fig. 2(a))) and the stability of this solution\ndoes not change in the considered range of the amplitude of excitation f .\nThe same scenarios, with division into right (only continuous line) and left (continuous and dasheddotted lines) sides of the edge of the tongues are observed for other resonances (see Fig. 2(a)). In case of\n2 : 1 resonance branching bifurcation is a period doubling bifurcation while for other resonances branching\nbifurcation leads to different locking ratios.\nFor 2 : 1 resonance in the range \u03bc \u2208 (1.23, 1.317) the continuous green line is below the dashed-dotted\ngreen line. In this area we observe the bifurcation scenario which is shown in Fig. 2(d) for \u03bc = 1.275 in\nthe range f \u2208 (0.0, 2.5) versus maximum amplitude of Duffing oscillator. The black solid line shows the\ngrowth of the amplitude of the Duffing oscillations in the case when the pendulum is in the lower equilibrium\nposition. This PO loses its stability in the saddle-node bifurcation (the pendulum persists in the equilibrium\nposition). Then we observe the branching bifurcation of the unstable PO and the appearance of new branch\nof the PO for which the pendulum is in 2 : 1 resonance with excitation (grey line). After two saddle-node\nbifurcations the branch of the PO stabilizes for \u03bc = 0.129 (see zoom in Fig. 2d). Finally, for \u03bc = 0.1378 the\nPO loses its symmetry in the pitchfork bifurcation and through the Neimark-Saker bifurcation (\u03bc = 0.1379)\nbecomes unstable.\nIn Fig. 2(b) we show main destabilization scenarios for locked PO. The resonances tongues are marked by\ngrey lines in the background of the plot. The Neimark-Saker bifurcations (long curve in Fig. 2(b)) destroys\nthe 1 : 1 resonant PO, i.e., above line of this bifurcation locked 1 : 1 PO does not exist. Other lines are\nconnected to stability of 2 : 1 tongue. The dashed light blue line indicates the symmetry breaking pitchfork\nbifurcation and just after it we observe the period doubling bifurcation (detailed route to chaos is shown\nin zoom in Fig. 2(c)). At the end of period doubling line we detect the Neimark-Saker bifurcation, which\nmerges with the symmetry breaking pitchfork bifurcation and 2 : 1 resonance curve. Other PO presented\nin Fig. 2(a) are stable in the whole covering range but they are accessible only for carefully chosen initial\nconditions.\n4.2. Rotation in plane (f, \u03bc)\nIn Fig. 3(a) we show the bifurcation diagram of rotations in two-parameter (f, \u03bc) plane. To observe\na rotational solutions pendulum has to undergo a global heteroclinic bifurcation. It means that this class\nof solutions could not be approached by following a steady state or PO. For continuation, one has to start\nfrom an integrated PR orbit. Two kinds of PR can occur in a considered system similarly to parametrically\nforced pendulum. One with a constant rotational motion in one direction are called a pure rotations [8]\nand second one with change of rotation direction are termed oscillations-rotations [41]. All lines presented\nin Fig. 3(a) are saddle-node bifurcations of PR [8, 13]. We observe the following resonant continuous PR:\nthree ranges of the 1 : 1 locked PR in clockwise and counter-clockwise directions (solid grey), the 1 : 3\nin clockwise and counter-clockwise directions (solid black line). Bifurcation curves of both clockwise and\ncounter-clockwise directions overlap due to the symmetry \u03b3 \u2192 \u2212\u03b3. The third state is a repeated sequence of\noscillations-rotations: one rotation in clockwise and one in counter-clockwise direction (1L1R). In Fig. 3(b)\nwe show the bifurcations which destroy PR. The 1 : 1 rotational motion (solid grey line (a1)) is stable in the\nlarge range of parameters, its stability is bounded by the Neimark-Saker bifurcation (see black line (b1)) in\nthe right part of Fig. 3(b)). The second 1 : 1 area is bounded by the solid gray line (a2), with increasing\n6\n\n\f2.5\n\nf\n\n(a)\n\n(a2)\n\n2\n1.5\n1\n\nRotations 1:1\nRotations 1:3\n1 rot. clockwise, 1 counterclockwise\n\n(a3)\n\n0.5\n(a1)\n0\n\n(b4)\n\n(b)\n\nf\n2\n\n(b3)\n\n(b6)\n\n1.5\n(b5)\n(b1)\n\n1\n0.5\n0\n\n0\n\nSymetry breaking\nPeriod doubling\nNS bifurcation\nLocked PR\n\n(b2)\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n\u03bc\n\n3\n\nFigure 3: Bifurcation diagram of PR for system (7) in two parameter space (f ,\u03bc). Lines show bifurcations to PR with different\nlocking ratios (a) and their destruction (b).\n\n7\n\n\fparameters we observe the Neimark-Saker bifurcation, which destabilizes this resonance (curve (b5)). The\nlast 1 : 1 PR (line (a3)) is bounded by the period doubling bifurcation curve (curve (b2)). The 1L1R PR\ngoes through the symmetry breaking pitchfork bifurcation (curve (b4)) and the period doubling bifurcation\n(curve (b6)) finally reaches the chaotic attractor in the period doubling cascades (the detailed description\nin Fig. 4(d)). The stability of 1 : 3 PR is bounded, on right side, by the Neimark-Saker bifurcation (curve\n(b3)), where we observe emergence of quasiperiodic motion, and further transition to chaotic attractor via\ntorus breakdown with increasing of the amplitude f . On the left side this resonance disappear in period\ndoubling bifurcation (line (b2)).\n4.3. One parameter continuation\nIn this section, we present one-parameter continuations of periodic solutions (PO as well as PR) versus\nthe amplitude f or frequency \u03bc of excitation. We follow periodic solutions emerging in bifurcations presented\nin the previous sections. In Fig. 4(a-c) we plot maximum velocity \u03b3\u0307 while in Fig. 4(d) maximum angular\nposition \u03b3. PO and PR presented in Fig. 4(a) are calculated for the frequency of excitation fixed to\n\u03bc = 0.92 and f is varied. When f \u2208 (0.0, 0.812) we observe the oscillation of the Duffing oscillator while\nthe pendulum is in the lower equilibrium position (line (1)). At the end of this interval this state looses its\nstability in the subcritical branching bifurcation and unstable PO is created. For f = 0.162 the pendulum\noscillations stabilize via saddle-node bifurcation and further destabilize at f = 0.274 through the NeimarkSaker bifurcation (curve (2)). For this value of the frequency \u03bc there appear rotational solutions. The line\n(3) corresponds to rotational resonance 1 : 3 and the line (4) indicates 1L1R PR, both solutions appear\nthrough the saddle-node bifurcations for f = 1.11 and for f = 1.0 respectively. Line (5) shows 9 : 9 resonance\nstable in range f \u2208 (0.49, 0.51) (this locked solution have small area of existence, and we do not show it in\ntwo-dimensional bifurcations diagram).\nIn Fig. 4(b) the frequency is fixed as \u03bc = 1.2. We observe a stable steady state of the pendulum in\nthe whole range of f (line (1)). In this case, the dynamics is reduced to the motion of the forced Duffing\noscillator. We also observe the 4 : 3 locked oscillation for f \u2208 (0.628, 0.847) (line (2)), which corresponds to\nthe loop in two dimensional plot (see right side of 4 : 3 resonance in Fig. 3(a)). Stable 1 : 1 rotations (line\n(5)) in both directions appear in the first range in Neimark-Saker and become unstable in period doubling\nbifurcation ( f \u2208 (0.39, 0.40)). In the second range 1 : 1 PR stabilize by the saddle-node bifurcation and\nbecome unstable through the Neimark-Saker bifurcation for f \u2208 (0.743, 0.938). Last two curves are PR:\n1 : 3 rotation is stable from f = 0.733 (line (3)), and 1L1R motion is stable in range f \u2208 (0.736, 1.44) (line\n(4)).This last 1L1R PR disappears in symmetry breaking pitchfork bifurcation; the detailed analysis of this\nPR and its bifurcations is presented in Fig. 4(d).\nIn Fig. 4(c) we show the periodic solutions for \u03bc = 2.25. One can observe 2 : 1 resonant PO (line\n(2)), which emerges at the branching bifurcation (f = 1.39) from stable steady state of the pendulum (line\n(1)) and stable 1 : 1 rotation (line (3)) which starts at the saddle-node bifurcation and terminates in the\nNeimark-Saker bifurcations at the ends of the interval f \u2208 (0.147, 1.75).\nThe last plot (Fig. 4(d)) shows a route to chaos starting from 1L1R rotations for fixed value f = 1.25 and\nvariable \u03bc. For frequency \u03bc = 0.80, we observe the saddle-node bifurcation (on line (1)), when \u03bc = 1.218\nthe PR goes through the symmetry breaking pitchfork bifurcation and two asymmetric 1L1R rotation\nappears (line (2)). Further we observe the range of existence of stable two dimensional quasiperiodic solution\n(confirmed by integration), which starts and ends in the Neimark-Saker (f = 1.249) and the inverse NeimarkSaker (f = 1.268) bifurcations (on line (2)). Finally, we observe the period doubling route to chaos. We\nshow only the first solution branch with doubled period (line (3)).\n4.4. Influence of non\u2013linearity of spring\nThe characteristic of spring have a significant influence on transfer of energy from Duffing oscillator to\nthe pendulum during resonances [30, 32]. In Fig. 5 we present these properties for two pairs of parameters:\nfirst for \u03bc = 1.0 and f = 0.49 in 1 : 1 resonance tongue (a) and second for \u03bc = 2.0 and f = 1.02 in 2 : 1\nresonance tongue (b). Black and gray colours indicate respectively the maximum position of mass M \u2013 x\nand the maximum angle of the pendulum \u2013 \u03b3 as functions of the spring non-linearity \u03b1.

Characteristic of spring is changing from \"soft\" to \"hard\"\nwith the increasing of \u03b1. Continuous and dashed lines indicate stable and unstable periodic solutions. Abbreviation NS indicate\nNeimark-Saker bifurcation.\n\nand dashed lines indicate respectively stable and unstable PO. It is easy to see that for 1 : 1 resonance in\nthe case of \u03b1 = 0 linear resonance occurs (Duffing oscillator is reduced to linear oscillator). For smaller\nvalues of \u03b1 the amplitude of oscillations is rapidly decreasing for both pendulum and Duffing oscillator up\nto \u03b1 = \u22120.97 where the motion of the pendulum stops. Similar decreasing of the amplitude of oscillations\nappears for positive \u03b1,but motion terminates at \u03b1 = 4.05. For \u03bc = 0.05 we observe the Neimark-Saker\nbifurcation followed by the inverse Neimark-Saker bifurcation for \u03bc = 0.075. Between the bifurcation we\nobserve a stable quasiperiodic motion. In Fig. 5(b) one observes a stable 2 : 1 PO in the whole range of \u03b1.\nWhen the system is changing from soft to hard characteristic of spring amplitudes of the Duffing oscillator\nand the pendulum are increasing. We do not observe a resonance of Duffing system.\n5. Coexistence of solutions\nAs follows from the previous sections, see e.g. Fig. 4(a-d), multiple stable periodic solutions often coexist\nfor the same parameter values. In this section we illustrate basins of attraction of different stable periodic\nsolution. Numerical package Dynamics 2 [42] is used. We choose six representative sets of parameters (f, \u03bc)\nand show the calculated basins in plane (\u03b3, \u03b3\u0307) (angular displacement and velocity of pendulum), where\n\u03b3 is mod 2\u03c0. Initial conditions of the pendulum are taken in ranges: \u03b3 \u2208 (\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0) and \u03b3\u0307 \u2208 (4, \u22124), initial\nconditions of Duffing oscillator are fixed for each plot and have the following values: x0 = 0, \u1e8b0 = 0 (a,b,d,e),\nx0 = 2.0, \u1e8b0 = 5.0 (c, f). Since different initial conditions of the Duffing oscillator may lead to different\nattractors in plane (\u03b3, \u03b3\u0307), the obtained figures show two-dimensional cross-sections of the four directional\nphase space (plus the phase of the perturbation). There no guarantee that for other initial states of Duffing\nwe reach the same set of attractors. As one can see in Fig. 3 and Fig. 7 most of the periodic solutions are\naccumulated in range \u03bc \u2208 (0.7, 1.3), so we calculated four out of six the basins in this area. In Fig. 6(a)\n(\u03bc = 0.9 and f = 0.5) we find five attractors: steady state, pair of period nine motion and chaotic motion\nwhich bifurcates from 1 : 1 PO. Then in Fig. 6(b) (\u03bc = 1.03 and f = 1.25) one can observe five attractors.\nTwo of them are symmetric pairs of rotations (1 : 3 resonance), two corresponds to symmetric 1 : 1 PO and\nthe last one is the 1L1R PR. Next plot (\u03bc = 1.2 and f = 0.75) includes seven attractors: two symmetric\npairs of PR (1 : 1 and 1 : 3), 4 : 3 PO, equilibrium of pendulum and 1L1R PR. In Fig. 6(d) (\u03bc = 1.229 and\nf = 1.0) we detect six solutions, two of them are quasiperiodic bifurcated from symmetric pair of 1 : 1 PR ,\npair of 1 : 3 PR, steady state of pendulum and 1L1R PR. For larger values of excitation we also find chaotic\n10\n\n\fattractor, e.g. for \u03bc = 1.6, f = 1.95 (see Fig. 6(e)). Usually the chaotic solution dominates the whole phase\nspace and the coexisting attractors have small basins of attraction, and such a situation is also observed in\nthe investigated system (7). In the last Fig. 6(f) we show a case where we do not observe fractal basins of\nattraction. Most of the phase space is dominated by period two symmetric PO, only in small range one can\nsee basins of symmetric pair of 1 : 1 PR.\nGenerally, in area where 1L1R PR exists its basin of attraction dominate in phase space. The 4 : 3\nresonance could be observed for all pairs of parameters used in Fig. 6(a-d). Nevertheless, we see this\nattractor only in Fig. 6(c), where different initial conditions of Duffing are used. This is the evidence that\nnot only sensitivity on initial state is observed for pendulum but also for Duffing. Varying initial condition\nof Duffing moves cross-section of the phase space and changes the set of accessible attractors.\nAlmost all basins of attraction have a fractal structure, so reaching the given solution is strongly dependent on initial conditions. From the practical point of view it is important to know the area with a\nsmall number or even one solution [43]. In such ranges one can be sure that the system approaches the\nexpected solution. In Fig. 7 we marked the areas with different types of attractors: black colour indicates\none attractor (four locked PO, excluding 4 : 3 resonance, between two branching bifurcation lines on the\nleft and right side - the edges of the resonance tongues), grey colour refers to two coexisting solutions (the\nsame as for black but with coexisting steady state of the pendulum). In the hatched area we observe the\ncoexistence of PR (two symmetric pairs of 1 : 1 or 1 : 3 or 1L1R PR) and the steady state of the pendulum.\nThe largest area with one attractor is a tongue of 2 : 1 resonance. For other resonances (1 : 1, 2 : 3, 2 : 5,\n1 : 2) these areas are small. Especially, it is surprising for 1 : 1 where the resonance tongue is large in the\nparameter space but only near its edge we do not find the second attractor. We do not mark the areas where\nonly Duffing system is oscillating and pendulum is stable equilibrium position. In this case the dynamics of\nthe system is reduced to the oscillations of mass (M + m).\n6. Conclusions\nWe present a comprehensive numerical analysis of the forced Duffing oscillator with the suspended\npendulum. We show two dimensional bifurcation diagrams with the most representative periodic solutions\nand demonstrate the bifurcation route to the locked resonances. The linear resonance of both subsystems\nis observed for \u03bc = 1.0 and around this value we find complex dynamics with many coexisting attractors,\nnot only periodic but also quasiperiodic and chaotic ones. In the principal resonance zone the pendulum\noscillations decrease the oscillation amplitude of the Duffing oscillator so we observe an energy transfer from\nthe Duffing oscillator to the pendulum. These properties are observed only for 1 : 1 oscillatory resonance, for\nother locked solutions (oscillations or rotations) the pendulum oscillations increase the oscillations amplitude\nof the Duffing oscillator (the control and the possible decrease of the amplitude for other resonances will\nbe considered in future work). Contrary to complex dynamics around 1 : 1 principal resonance in the\nneighbourhood of 2 : 1 parametric resonance, we find two large ranges in parameters space with only one\nattractor (2 : 1 locked oscillations) and symmetric pair of 1 : 1 rotations respectively. From the practical\npoint of view (certainty of reaching the desired attractor) such a situation is very useful and rare in non\u2013\nlinear system. We also compare the influence of non-linearity of spring on the amplitude of oscillations For\nprincipal 1 : 1 resonance, strong non-linearity (hardening or softening) causes lower amplitude of oscillations.\nFor 2 : 1 parametric resonance only the decrease of \u03b1 into the softening direction causes the decrease of the\noscillations amplitude. The existence of fractal basins of attraction is not surprising for non\u2013linear systems\nwith the attached pendulum. Hence, we can consider only the probability of reaching the chosen attractor\nand never have a certainty where the dynamics of systems evolves. This is crucial when the pendulum is\nworking as a tune mass absorber so we show the areas with a low number of coexisting solutions in the\nparameters space.\nAcknowledgement\nThis work has been supported by the Foundation for Polish Science, Team Programme under project\nTEAM/2010/5/5(P.B., P.P. and T.K.), Foundation for Polish Science, the START fellowship (P.P). and\n11\n\n\f4\n\n4\n\n(a)\n\n\u03b3\n\nEquilibrium (a,c,d)\n\n(b)\n\n\u03b3\n\nRotations 1:3 clockwise (b,c,d,e)\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-2\n\nRotations 1:3\ncounter-clockwise (b,c,d,e)\nRotations 1:1 clockwise (c,d,f)\nor quasi-periodic (d)\nRotations 1:1 counter-clockwise\n(c,d,f) or quasi-periodic (d)\n1 rotation clockwise,\n1 counter-clockwise (b,c,d)\nOscillations 4:3 (c)\n\n-4\n\n-\u03c0/2\n\n-\u03c0\n\n4\n\n0\n\u03b3 mod 2\u03c0\n\n\u03c0/2\n\n\u03c0\n\nOscillations 9:9 (a)\n\n-\u03c0/2\n\n-\u03c0\n\n4\n\n(c)\n\n\u03b3\n\n-4\n\n0\n\u03b3 mod 2\u03c0\n\n\u03c0/2\n\n\u03c0\n\nChaotic behaviour (a)\n\n(d)\n\n\u03b3\n\nOscillations 9:9 (a)\n\nChaotic behaviour (a)\nOscillations 1:1 (b)\n\n2\n\n2\n\nOscillations 1:1 (b)\nOscillations 2:1 (f)\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n-\u03c0/2\n\n-\u03c0\n\n0\n\u03b3 mod 2\u03c0\n\n\u03c0/2\n\n\u03c0\n\n-4\n\n4\n\n-\u03c0\n\n-\u03c0/2\n\n0\n\u03b3 mod 2\u03c0\n\n\u03c0/2\n\n\u03c0\n\n-\u03c0/2\n\n0\n\u03b3 mod 2\u03c0\n\n\u03c0/2\n\n\u03c0\n\n4\n\n(e)\n\n\u03b3\n\n(f)\n\n\u03b3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\nChaotic behaviour (e)\n\n-\u03c0\n\n-\u03c0/2\n\n0\n\u03b3 mod 2\u03c0\n\n\u03c0/2\n\n\u03c0\n\n-4\n\n-\u03c0\n\nFigure 6: (colour) Basins of attraction in the plane of the pendulum variables (\u03b3, \u03b3\u0307) for \u03bc = 0.9, f = 0.5 (a); \u03bc = 1.03, f = 1.25\n(b); \u03bc = 1.2, f = 0.75 (c); \u03bc = 1.229, f = 1.0 (d); \u03bc = 1.6, f = 1.95 (e), and \u03bc = 2.37, f = 2.25 (f).

Black colour indicates one attractor (for locked\nPO, excluding 4 : 3 resonance, between period doubling bifurcation lines on the left and right side - edges of the resonance\ntongues), grey colour shows two coexisting attractors (the same as for black but with coexisting stable steady state of the\npendulum). In the hatched area we observe the coexistence of stable rotations (three areas with: pairs of symmetric 1 : 1 or\n1 : 3 or 1L1R PR) and stable steady state of the pendulum.\n\nDFG Research Center MATHEON \"Mathematics for key technologies\" under the project D21 (S.Y.).\nReferences\nReferences\n[1] R.W.
