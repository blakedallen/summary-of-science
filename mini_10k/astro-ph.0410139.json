The availability of such high energies in the early universe and the huge separation\nbetween conventional accelerator experiments and the Planck scale has led many to turn from acceleratorbased experiments to cosmological observations in order to test such theories. Inflationary cosmology [1]\nis one of the paradigms that may serve this purpose. There, it is assumed that quantum fluctuations of\nthe inflaton are stretched by inflationary expansion to cosmological scales. About 60 e-folds of inflationary\nexpansion are necessary to solve many of the puzzles of big bang cosmology but in most inflationary models\nthe expansion is much larger. In models proposed by Linde [2] the universe has expanded by a factor of\n12\n\n1010 . An implication of these models is, therefore, that our observable universe was of sub-Planckian size\nat the beginning of the (last) inflationary period. This suggests that inflation could act as a magnifying glass\nfor probing the short distance structure of space-time.\nA similar question had arisen concerning a possible sensitivity of black hole radiation to transplanckian\nphysics. There, it has been found that Hawking radiation is largely immune to transplanckian effects, see\ne.g. [3]. In the case of inflation, however, it has been found that the inflationary predictions for the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) do possess a small and possibly even observable sensitivity to modifications\nof quantum field theory in the ultraviolet. To this end, various examples of ultraviolet-modified dispersion\n1 amjad@astro.uwaterloo.ca\n2 akempf@uwaterloo.ca\n3 mann@avatar.uwaterloo.ca\n\n\frelations, some motivated by solid state analogs, have been tested for their effects on inflation, see [4, 5, 6, 7].\nIn particular, and this will be our interest here, the ultraviolet cutoff described by a lower bound in the formal\nuncertainty in position, \u2206xmin , has also been investigated for its implications in inflation, see [8, 9, 10, 11].\nTo model the small scale structure of space through a finite minimum position uncertainty \u2206xmin is of\ninterest because the corresponding modified uncertainty principle has been motivated to arise from quite\ngeneral quantum gravity arguments as well as from string theory, see e.g. [12, 13, 14, 15]. In fact, any theory\nwith this type of ultraviolet cutoff can be written, equivalently, as a continuum theory and as a lattice theory,\nsee [16]. While in the continuum formulation the theory displays unbroken external symmetries, the theory's\nultraviolet regularity is displayed in its lattice formulation.\nIndeed, it has been found that inflationary predictions for the CMB are sensitive to the natural ultraviolet\ncutoff if the cutoff is modelled through a finite minimum uncertainty in positions, \u2206xmin . The magnitude by\nwhich the cutoff affects the predicted scalar and tensor spectra in the CMB was found to depend crucially on\nthe initial conditions when a mode's evolution begins, which is when its proper wave length is the minimum\nlength. These initial conditions determine how close the modes' state is to the adiabatic vacuum during the\nperiod of adiabatic evolution before the mode crosses the Hubble horizon. If the modes are in the adiabatic\nvacuum during the phase of adiabatic evolution then the effects of Planck scale physics on inflationary\npredictions should be no bigger than of the order of \u03c3 2 , see [9], where:\n\u03c3=\n\n\u2206xmin\nLHubble\n\n(1)\n\nHere, LHubble is the Hubble length during inflation. Thus, we have approximately \u03c3 \u2248 10\u22123 if the cutoff\n\nlength, \u2206xmin , is at the string scale and \u03c3 \u2248 10\u22125 if the cutoff length is at the Planck scale. In principle,\n\nhowever, the cutoff can lead to arbitrarily large effects, namely if the modes' state during the adiabatic\nphase differs strongly from the adiabatic vacuum (see also [17]). In this case, the modulus of the mode\nfunctions oscillates at horizon crossing and these oscillations translate into characteristic oscillations in the\nCMB spectra. This possibility is restricted, however, by the need to keep the back-reaction small [18].\nInterestingly, Easther et.al. [10, 11] found that this constraint still allows nontrivial vacua with effects as\nlarge as of order \u03c3. Effects of this magnitude might reach the threshold of observability.\nSo far, initial conditions have been proposed based on analyticity arguments [9] and based on similarity\nto the Bunch Davies vacuum [10, 11]. A further suggestion is to minimize the field uncertainties [19, 20].\nStill, however, the crucial question how to determine initial conditions for the new comoving modes that are\ncontinually being created during an expansion has not been conclusively answered. The problem is of course\nequivalent to identifying the vacuum state.\nHere, we address this problem by reconsidering how the vacuum state is usually identified within inflationary QFT without a minimum length. Namely, the usual strategy is to make use of the fact that the action\ncan be rewritten so as to resemble the familiar action of a field on Minkowski space with time-dependent\nmass term. When quantizing, one then chooses the vacuum as one does for Minkowski space theories. We\nwill find that this method is no longer reliable when there is a minimum length. The reason is that the\nreformulation of the action requires the neglect of a boundary term that ceases to be a boundary term once\nthe minimum length is introduced. We find that the differences are small but noticeable both in the initial\nconditions and in the evolution equations. This shows that in any approach to introducing a minimum length\n2\n\n\finto inflation this will have to be taken into account: reformulations of an action that appear to be harmless\ndue to neglect of a boundary term can lead to an unintended modification of the theory.\nTo see how this phenomenon can arise, let us recall that the particular model of a natural ultraviolet\ncutoff that we are considering is described by quantum mechanical uncertainty relations with correction\nterms in the ultraviolet, of the form\n\u2206x\u2206p \u2265\n\n\u0001\nh\u0304\n1 + \u03b2 (\u2206p)2 + ...\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b2 > 0 is a positive constant. In the simplest case, such an uncertainty relation arises from the modified\ncommutation relation:\n[X, P] = ih\u0304(1 + \u03b2 P2 )\n\n(3)\n\nIt is not difficult to show that the uncertainty relation then implies a finite lower bound to the position\nuncertainty \u2206x:\n\u2206xmin = h\u0304\n\np\n\u03b2\n\n(4)\n\nBy choosing \u03b2 appropriately we obtain a cutoff at the string or at the Planck scale. This type of ultraviolet\ncutoff was introduced into quantum field theory in [21] and then into inflationary cosmology in [8].\nIt is clear that similar to quantization, which changes the commutativity properties and therefore comes\nwith a well-known ordering ambiguity, the introduction of a minimum length through an equation such as\nEq. (3) changes the commutativity properties and therefore comes with an ordering ambiguity. In principle,\nof course, ordering ambiguities can be of arbitrary magnitude. For example, a classical system is unchanged\nby adding terms of the form (xp \u2212 px)f (x, p) to its Hamiltonian H. When promoting x and p to operators\n\nthe resulting terms become proportional to h\u0304 and could be arbitrarily large and significant to the evolution.\nIn the case we consider here, normally vanishing terms of the form (xp \u2212 px \u2212 ih\u0304)g(x, p) similarly become\n\nnonzero when \u03b2 6= 0. Here, the new Hamiltonian is determined only up to terms that vanish when setting\n\nthe minimum length to zero. Those terms can be arbitrarily large and, in principle, only experiments could\ndecide which choice is correct. This is to be expected in any approach to introducing some form of a natural\nminimum length.\nOf course, in the case of quantization it has proven to be a very reliable strategy to adopt the minimalist\napproach to resolving the ordering ambiguity: write the Hamiltonian in its most simple and symmetric form\nand leave it unchanged when introducing h\u0304, i.e. do not introduce terms by hand. The same minimalist\napproach has tacitly been applied in the literature when the minimum length uncertainty relation has been\nused in inflationary quantum field theory. We will now review this procedure, thereby uncovering potential\npitfalls with implications for the determination of the vacuum.\n\n2\n\nFluctuations in standard inflation\n\nIn inflation, see [1], we consider the action of the scalar inflaton field, minimally coupled to gravity:\nZ\nZ\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1\n1\n(\u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202 \u03bc \u03c6 \u2212 V (\u03c6)) \u2212g d4 x \u2212\nR \u2212g d4 x\nS=\n2\n16\u03c0G\n\n(5)\n\nOne assumes the background to be a homogenous isotropic Friedmann universe with zero spatial curvature.\n\u0001\nIn comoving coordinates y and comoving time \u03c4 , the metric reads ds2 = a2 (\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 2 \u2212 \u03b4ij dy i dy j . The\n3\n\n\fperturbations of the metric tensor can be decomposed into scalar, vector and tensor modes according to\ntheir transformation properties under spatial coordinate transformations on the constant-time hypersurfaces,\nnamely ds2 = ds2S + ds2V + ds2T , where:\nds2S = a2 (\u03c4 ) (1 + 2\u03a6)d\u03c4 2 \u2212 2\u2202i Bdy i d\u03c4 \u2212 [(1 \u2212 2\u03a8)\u03b4ij + 2\u2202i \u2202j E]dy i dy j\n\u0001\nds2V = a2 (\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 2 + 2Vi dxi d\u03c4 \u2212 [\u03b4ij + Wi,j + Wj,i ]dxi dxj\n\u0001\nds2T = a2 (\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 2 \u2212 [\u03b4ij + hij ]dxi dxj\n\n\u0001\n\n(6)\n(7)\n(8)\n\nThis generalizes the decomposition of vector fields into a curl and a gradient field. Here, \u03a6, B, \u03a8 and E\nare scalar fields, Vi and Wi are 3-vector fields satisfying Vi,i = Wi,i = 0 and hij is a symmetric threetensor field satisfying hii = 0 = hij ,j . The inflaton field \u03c6(y, \u03c4 ) fluctuates about its spatially homogeneous\nbackground \u03c6(y, \u03c4 ) = \u03c60 (\u03c4 ) + \u03b4\u03c6(y, \u03c4 ), where \u03c60 (\u03c4 ) is the homogenous part of the scalar field that is driving\nthe background expansion and the perturbation is assumed small: |\u03b4\u03c6| \u226a \u03c60 . In standard inflation, vector\n\nfluctuations are not amplified by the expansion but it should be interesting to reconsider if this still holds\ntrue in inflation with a minimum length. Here, we will focus on scalar and tensor fluctuations.\n\n2.1\n\nScalar perturbations\n\nIt is the quantum fluctuations of the intrinsic curvature R which are thought to have seeded what later\n\nbecame the dominant perturbations in the CMB. The intrinsic curvature R, which is gauge invariant, can\n\nbe expressed as\n\nR=\u2212\n\na\u2032 \u03b4\u03c6\n\u2212 \u03a8,\na \u03c6\u20320\n\n(9)\n\nThe prime denotes differentiation with respect to the conformal time \u03c4 . Expanding the action to second\norder yields\n(1)\nSS\n\nfor the action of R,where\n\n1\n=\n2\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c4 d3 y z 2 (\u2202\u03c4 R)2 \u2212 \u03b4 ij \u2202i R\u2202j R\nz=\n\na\u03c6\u20320\n,\n\u03b1\n\n\u0001\n\n\u03b1 = a\u2032 /a\n\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\nClearly, the very simplest formulation that one can give for the action of the field R is given in Eq. (10).\n\nThe minimalist approach to dealing with ordering ambiguities therefore requires one to start from this\n\nformulation of the action when introducing h\u0304 and the minimum length \u2206xmin while not introducing any\nambiguous terms by hand. This was indeed tacitly the route taken in work that introduced the minimum\nlength into inflationary QFT [8, 9, 10, 11].\nIn the vast literature on standard inflationary theory, however, a slight reformulation of the action is\nusually preferred as the starting point for quantization. Namely, one often introduces an auxiliary field\nvariable, u, through\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c6\u2032 \u03a8\nu = \u2212zR = a \u03b4\u03c6 + 0\n\u03b1\n\nwhose dynamics follows from the action:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n1\nz \u2032\u2032 2\n(2)\n2\n3\nij\nSS =\nd\u03c4 d y (\u2202\u03c4 u) \u2212 \u03b4 \u2202i u \u2202j u + u\n2\nz\n4\n\n(12)\n\n(13)\n\n\f(1)\n\nAs long as we do not introduce a minimum length, the two actions SS\n\n(2)\n\nand SS\n\nare equivalent. More\n\nprecisely, they differ by a boundary term:\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nSS \u2212 SS =\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c4 d3 y\n\nd\nd\u03c4\n\n\u0012\n\nz\u2032 2\nu\nz\n\n\u0013\n\n(14)\n(2)\n\n(1)\n\nThe reason why one often prefers to quantize starting from the action SS rather than from the action SS\n(2)\n\nis that SS possesses no overall time-dependent factor, and this gives it the appearance of an action of a free\nfield theory on flat space. Its only nontrivial aspect is that the field u(y, \u03c4 ) has a time-varying \"mass\" z \u2032\u2032 /z.\nThe similarity to a Minkowski space theory suggests that in this formulation the field can be quantized in\nthe same way that one would quantize a field on flat space. This suggests that one can identify the vacuum\nstate in the same way as one does in the case of Minkowski space theories. Concretely, the Euler Lagrange\nfield equation reads:\n\nz \u2032\u2032\n\u00fb = 0.\n(15)\nz\n\u2032\ns\nThe momentum conjugate to u(y, \u03c4 ) is given by \u03c0(y, \u03c4 ) = \u2202L\n\u2202u\u2032 = u (y, \u03c4 ). To quantize, one promotes u and\n\u00fb\u2032\u2032 \u2212 \u22072 \u00fb \u2212\n\n\u03c0 to operators, \u00fb and \u03c0\u0302, which satisfy canonical commutation relations on hypersurfaces of constant \u03c4 :\n[\u00fb(\u03c4, y), \u00fb(\u03c4, y\u2032 )] = [\u03c0\u0302(\u03c4, y), \u03c0\u0302(\u03c4, y\u2032 )] = 0\n\n(16)\n\n[\u00fb(\u03c4, y), \u03c0\u0302(\u03c4, y\u2032 )] = i\u03b4 3 (y \u2212 y\u2032 )\n\n(17)\n\nEmploying the plane wave expansion\n\u00fb(\u03c4, y) =\n\nZ\n\ni\nd3 k h\n\u2020 \u2212ik*y\nik*y\n\u2217\nu\n(\u03c4\n)\u00e2\ne\n+\nu\n(\u03c4\n)\u00e2\ne\nk\nk\nk\nk\n(2\u03c0)3/2\n\n(18)\n\nthe fields will obey the commutation relations Eqs. (16,17) if the operators \u00e2k obey the Fock commutation\nrelations [\u00e2k , \u00e2k\u2032 ] = [\u00e2\u2020k , \u00e2\u2020k\u2032 ] = 0, [\u00e2k , \u00e2\u2020k\u2032 ] = i\u03b4 3 (k \u2212 k\u2032 ) and if the mode functions uk obey the Wronskian\ncondition:\n\ndu\u2217\nduk\n\u2212 uk k = \u2212i.\n(19)\nd\u03c4\nd\u03c4\nFurther, the field equation will be obeyed if the number-valued functions uk (\u03c4 ) obey the mode equation:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nz \u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n2\nuk + k \u2212\nuk = 0.\n(20)\nz\nu\u2217k\n\nAt this point, initial conditions must be chosen for the solution of Eq. (20). This choice is crucial because it\nimplies the identification of the vacuum state and this affects all predictions of the theory. Intuitively, one\nexpects that if a mode can be followed back to when its proper wavelength was infinitesimally short then\none sees the mode when it was virtually unaffected by curvature, i.e. here by the expansion. One should\ntherefore be able to identify the correct solution of the mode equation at those early times, which then sets\nthe initial conditions of the mode for all time. Indeed, in Eq. (20), one observes that z \u2032\u2032 /z \u2192 0 at early\n\ntimes, \u03c4 \u2192 \u2212\u221e, i.e. when the mode's proper wave length was arbitrarily short. In this limit, Eq. (20)\n\nformally turns into u\u2032\u2032k + k 2 uk = 0 which is the zero mass wave equation for a Minkowski space theory. For\nsuch a theory the correct solution of the wave equation is known and one proceeds, therefore, to impose\n1\ne\u2212ik\u03c4\nuk (\u03c4 ) \u2192 \u221a\n2k\n5\n\nfor \u03c4 \u2192 \u2212\u221e\n\n(21)\n\n\fas the initial condition for Eq. (20). This identifies the initial vacuum of each mode as the incoming lowest\nenergy vacuum. The mathematical problem for calculating u is now well-posed. Finding u then yields the\nmode function for the intrinsic curvature R = \u2212u/z and from it we finally obtain the observationally relevant\n1/2\n\npower spectrum PS (k), of the intrinsic curvature's quantum fluctuations after horizon crossing:\nr\nk3\n1/2\n|Rk | k\nPs (k) =\n2\u03c0 2\naH \u226a1\n(1)\n\nTo conclude: before introducing a minimum length the actions SS\n\n(2)\n\nand SS\n\n(22)\n\ndiffer merely by a boundary\n(2)\n\nterm. Thus, re-expressing the mode equation Eq. (20) that followed from SS\n\nin terms of the intrinsic\n\ncurvature yields\n\n2z \u2032 \u2032\nR + k 2 Rk\u0303 = 0\n(23)\nz k\u0303\nwhich is of course the same mode equation that one obtains as Euler Lagrange equation directly from the\nR\u2032\u2032k\u0303 +\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\naction SS . The rationale for taking the detour via the action SS is that this route exhibits a similarity with\nQFT on Minkowski space, which suggests a particular choice of initial condition and thus of the vacuum.\n\n2.2\n\nTensor perturbations\n\nThe situation for the tensor modes h is similar. Their dynamics is determined by expanding the EinsteinHilbert action to second order:\n(1)\nST\n\nm2\n= Pl\n64\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c4 d3 y a2 (\u03c4 ) \u2202\u03bc hi j \u2202 \u03bc hi j\n\n(24)\n\nThe aim is to calculate the spectrum of the quantum fluctuations of h after horizon crossing. This spectrum\nshould become empirically testable through measurements of the CMB's B-polarization spectrum, the first\nmeasurements of which may come from the upcoming PLANCK satellite telescope.\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\nIt is clear that the action ST is of precisely the same form as SS , up to constants and the replacement\nof z(\u03c4 ) by a(\u03c4 ). This means that it is possible to reformulate also the tensor action to give it the appearance\nof a Minkowski space theory with variable mass term, thereby obtaining a criterion for picking the initial\n(1)\n\nconditions. Therefore, instead of quantizing directly from ST , one often prefers to introduce the re-scaled\nvariable, P i j\ni\n\nP j (y) =\n\nr\n\nm2P l\na(\u03c4 )hi j (y)\n32\u03c0\n\n(25)\n\nwhose dynamics follows from the action:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\na\u2032\u2032 j i\n1\n(2)\n3\nj \u03c4 i\nrs\nj\ni\nd\u03c4 d y \u2202\u03c4 Pi \u2202 P j \u2212 \u03b4 \u2202r Pi \u2202s P j + Pi P j\nST =\n2\na\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nAnalogously to the case of scalar fluctuations, the two actions ST , ST\ntotal time derivative\n\u25b3ST =\n\n(2)\nST\n\n\u2212\n\n(1)\nST\n\n32\u03c0\n= 2\nmP l\n\nand therefore lead to the same equation of motion.\n\nZ\n\nmerely differ by a term which is a\n\nd\u03c4 d3 y \u03b1Pi j P i j\n\n\u0001\u2032\n\nOne proceeds by decomposing P i j into its Fourier components\nX Z\nd3 k\ni\np (\u03c4 ) \u01ebi j (k; \u03bb) eik*y\nP j=\n3/2 k,\u03bb\n(2\u03c0)\n\u03bb=+,\u00d7\n6\n\n(26)\n\n(27)\n\n(28)\n\n\fwhere \u01ebi j (k; \u03bb) is the polarization tensor, satisfying the conditions: \u01ebij = \u01ebji ,\n\n\u01ebi i = 0,\n\nk i \u01ebij = 0 and\n\n\u01ebi j (k; \u03bb)\u01ebj\u2217 i (k; \u03bb\u2032 ) = \u03b4\u03bb\u03bb\u2032 . There are two independent polarization states, usually denoted \u03bb = +, \u00d7. It\n\nis convenient to choose \u01ebij (\u2212k; \u03bb) = \u01eb\u2217ij (k; \u03bb) which implies that pk,\u03bb = p\u2217\u2212k,\u03bb . The action for tensor\n\nperturbations then takes the form:\n(2)\n\nST =\n\nX Z\n\nd\u03c4 d3 k\n\n\u03bb=+,\u00d7\n\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\na\u2032\u2032\n|pk,\u03bb |2\n(\u2202\u03c4 |pk,\u03bb |)2 \u2212 k 2 \u2212\na\n\n(29)\n\nTo quantize, one promotes pk,\u03bb to an operator p\u0302k,\u03bb and expands it in terms of creation and annihilation\noperators, p\u0302k,\u03bb = pk (\u03c4 )\u00e2k,\u03bb + p\u2217k (\u03c4 )\u00e2\u2020k,\u03bb to obtain the wave equation\n\u0012\n\u0013\na\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n2\npk + k \u2212\npk = 0,\na\n\n(30)\n\nfor the mode functions pk (\u03c4 ) (omitting the index \u03bb). Analogously to scalar fluctuations, also the pk (\u03c4 ) must\nobey the Wronskian condition (19). As for scalar modes, the similarity with the zero mass Minkowski space\nwave equation at early times suggests to impose the initial condition that the field takes the form given in\n(21) for k/aH \u2192 \u221e. The mathematical problem is then well defined and p can be calculated. From p one\nq\ni\nobtains the tensor mode hi j = m32\u03c0\n2 a2 p j and finally the spectrum of tensor quantum fluctuations hk after\nPl\n\nhorizon crossing:\n\n1/2\nPT\n\n=\n\nr\n\nk3\n|hk |\n2\u03c0 2\n\nk\naH\n\n(31)\n\n\u226a1\n(2)\n\nTo summarize, as in the case of scalar fluctuations, one starts quantization from the action ST\n\nso as to\n\nexploit the similarity with Minkowski space QFT for identifying the initial conditions and thus the vacuum\nstate for tensor modes.\n\n3\n\nInflation with the minimum length uncertainty relation\n\nThe minimum length uncertainty principle was first introduced into inflation in [8]. One starts by implementing the uncertainty relations in first quantization through modifications of the canonical x, p commutation\nrelations, as in Eq. (3). The first quantization commutation relations then carry over to quantum field\ntheory. Note that since momentum space is unaffected by the minimum length uncertainty relations the\nfield commutators in momentum space remain unchanged by the procedure.\n(1)\n\nThis program was carried out explicitly [8] for an action of the form of the tensor action ST . This\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\nshowed how \u03b2 > 0 generalizes the action ST to a new action ST,\u03b2 and how the tensor fluctuations' equation\nof motion changes correspondingly. Those results immediately also translate to the case of the scalar action\n(1)\n\nSS\n\nsince this action differs merely by overall constants and by suitably replacing a(\u03c4 ) with z(\u03c4 ). These\n\nequations of motion have been further investigated in [10, 11]. We will explicitly list those equations of\nmotion below.\nOur aim now is to carry out the same program for introducing the minimum length, starting, however,\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\nfrom the often-used actions SS and ST to derive the generalized actions SS,\u03b2 and ST,\u03b2 and the correspondingly generalized equations of motion for scalar and tensor fluctuations. We will find that the generalized\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nactions SS,\u03b2 and SS,\u03b2 as well as the generalized actions ST,\u03b2 and ST,\u03b2 no longer differ merely by boundary\nterms, are therefore not equivalent and lead to slightly different equations of motion.\n7\n\n\f3.1\n\nScalar fluctuations with minimum length\n\nThe minimum length is to be introduced as a minimum proper length in the CMB rest frame. To this\n(2)\n\nend, we transform the action SS\n\nas given in Eq. (13 from comoving coordinates y i and time \u03c4 to proper\n\ncoordinates xi and time \u03c4 , where xi = a(\u03c4 )y i . Since the transformation is time-dependent, the chain rule\nleads to a nontrivial transformation of the derivative \u2202\u03c4 on fields and we obtain:\n(2)\nSS\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nd3 x\nd\u03c4 3\n2a\n\n(\"\n\n3\n3a\u2032\na\u2032 X\n\u2202xi xi \u2212\n\u2202\u03c4 +\na i=1\na\n\n! #2\nu\n\n3\nX\n\nz \u2032\u2032\n(\u2202xi u)2 + u2\n\u2212 a2\nz\ni=1\n\n)\n\n(32)\n\nWe identify \u2212i\u2202xi as the momentum operator, Pi , and xi as the position operator Xi . These operators are\n\ndefined on a Hilbert space of fields (not states) with:\nZ\n(u1 , u2 ) =\nd3 x u\u22171 (x)u2 (x)\nXi u(x) = xi u(x)\n\nPi u(x) = \u2212i\u2202xi u(x).\n\n(33)\n\nThe fields thus form a Hilbert space representation of the commutation relations:\n[Xi , Pj ] = i\u03b4 ij , [Xi , Xj ] = 0, [Pi , Pj ] = 0\n\n(34)\n\nThis merely expresses the fact that the canonical commutation relations of first quantization are present\nalso in second quantization. For example, in quantum field theory the h\u0304 of the Fourier factor eixp/h\u0304 directly\nderives from the h\u0304 in the commutation relations of first quantization. Of course, the operators Xi and Pj\nno longer possess a simple interpretation as observables. We see from Eqs. (13,32) that under the timedependent mapping from comoving to proper positions, the chain rule makes the action of \u2202\u03c4 on fields in\ncomoving coordinates transform into a new action on fields in proper coordinates, namely \u2202\u03c4 \u2192 A(\u03c4 ), where:\nA(\u03c4 ) =\n\n3\na\u2032\na\u2032 X i i\nP X \u22123\n\u2202\u03c4 + i\na i=1\na\n\n!\n\nUsing the operators X and P we can write the action (32) in representation-independent form\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n\u0001\n\u0001 z \u2032\u2032\nd\u03c4\n(2)\n\u2020\n2\n2\nu,\nA\n(\u03c4\n)A(\u03c4\n)u\n\u2212\na\nu,\nP\nu\n+\n(u,\nu)\n,\nSS =\n2a3\nz\n\n(35)\n\n(36)\n\nmeaning that (36) is true without referring to the position representation, momentum representation or\nany other representation of the fields. Following [8], our strategy now is to maintain this representationindependent form of the action while introducing a cutoff by modifying the underlying position-momentum\ncommutation relations (34). The modified commutation relations should break neither translation nor rotation invariance and should introduce a finite minimum position uncertainty \u2206xmin in all three position\nvariables. It has been shown [22] that all such commutation relations must have the following form\n!\n2\u03b2p2\nij\ni j\ni\nj\n\u03b4 + 2\u03b2 P P , [Xi , Xj ] = 0, [Pi , Pj ] = 0\n[X , P ] = i p\n1 + 4\u03b2p2 \u2212 1\n8\n\n(37)\n\n\fto first order in the parameter \u03b2, which is chosen positive, see [22]. The minimum position uncertainty\n\u2206xmin in every coordinate is given by\n\u2206xmin\n\n\u221a\n\u0011\n\u0010p\n\u03b2\n1/4\n1 + d/2 + 1\n=\n(1 + d/2)\n2\n\n(38)\n\n\u221a\nwhere d is the number of space dimensions, see [23]. Here d = 3, so that \u2206xmin \u2248 1.62 \u03b2. Correspondingly,\n\u221a\n\u03c3 \u2248 1.62 \u03b2H, where H is the Hubble parameter. A convenient Hilbert space representation of the modified\ncommutation relations (37), is given by\n\nXi \u03c8(\u03c1) = i\u2202\u03c1i \u03c8(\u03c1)\nPi \u03c8(\u03c1) =\nwith the scalar product:\n(\u03c81 , \u03c82 ) =\n\n(39)\n\ni\n\n\u03c1\n\u03c8(\u03c1)\n1 \u2212 \u03b2\u03c12\n\nZ\n\n\u03c12 <\u03b2 \u22121\n\n(40)\n\nd3 \u03c1 \u03c81\u2217 (\u03c1)\u03c82 (\u03c1)\n\n(41)\n\nThus, the operator A(\u03c4 ) changes as the minimum length is introduced, i.e. when \u03b2 > 0. The action for\nscalars, Eq. (36), then also changes to become:\n( \u0012\n\u0013\nZ\nZ\n\u03c1i\na\u2032\n3a\u2032\n1\n(2)\n3\nu\n\u2202\u03c4 \u2212\n\u2202\u03c1i \u2212\nSS,\u03b2 = d\u03c4\nd \u03c1 3\n2a\na 1 \u2212 \u03b2\u03c12\na\n\u03c12 <\u03b2 \u22121\n\n2\n\na2 \u03c12 |u|2\nz \u2032\u2032 2\n\u2212\n+\n|u|\n(1 \u2212 \u03b2\u03c12 )2\nz\n\n)\n\n(42)\n\nThe presence of \u03c1 derivatives means that the \u03c1 modes are coupled. Conveniently, in the new variables (\u03c4\u0303 , k\u0303)\n\u03c4\u0303 = \u03c4,\n2\n\nk\u0303 i = a\u03c1i e\u2212\u03b2\u03c1\n\n/2\n\n(43)\n\nthe k\u0303 modes decouple. To see this, note that:\n\u2202\u03c4 \u2212\n\na\u2032\n\u03c1i\n\u2202 i = \u2202\u03c4\u0303 .\na 1 \u2212 \u03b2\u03c12 \u03c1\n\n(44)\n\nWe will use the common index notation \u016bk\u0303 for the decoupling modes. The k\u0303 modes only coincide with the\nusual comoving modes on large scales, i.e., only for small \u03c12 . This means that the precisely comoving k\nmodes, obtained by scaling k i = api , decouple only at large distances; at distances close to the cutoff scale\nthey couple.

As expected,\n\neach comoving mode k\u0303 has a starting time, \u03c4c , namely the time at which a(\u03c4c ) =\n9\n\ne\u03b2 k\u0303 2 , which is when\n\n\f\u03c12 = 1/\u03b2, which is when the mode's proper wave length is the cutoff length.

This is not a consequence of the introduction of the minimum length. Instead, it is merely due\nto our choice of variables. To see this, note first that the functions \u03bc and \u03ba are simpler in the variables \u03c4\nand \u03c1i :\na 2 \u03c12\n(1 \u2212 \u03b2\u03c12 )2\n\n\u03bc(\u03c4, \u03c1) =\n\n(49)\n\n2\n\ne3\u03b2\u03c1 /2\n1 \u2212 \u03b2\u03c12\n\n\u03ba(\u03c1) =\n\n(50)\n\nThus, as the cutoff is removed, \u03b2 \u2192 0, we have that \u03bc \u2192 k 2 and \u03ba \u2192 1. The action (45) thus turns\n\ninto a conventional-looking action, except for an overall factor of a\u22126 . The many terms of a and a\u2032 in the\nequation of motion (48) trace back to this pre-factor a\u22126 in the action (45). The occurrence of the factor\n(2)\n\na6 might be surprising since we had started with the action SS as given in (13), which of course does not\npossess a time-dependent pre-factor. The reason for the occurrence of this pre-factor is that the operations\nof Fourier transforming and of scaling do not commute: We did not directly Fourier transform the original\naction (13) from comoving positions to comoving momenta, as is usually done. Instead, we first scaled\nthe comoving position coordinates to proper coordinates (where we introduced the minimum length), then\nFourier transformed to proper momenta, and finally scaled to comoving momenta. The field variable \u016bk\u0303\ntherefore differs from the usual field variable uk\u0303 by a factor of a\u22123 :\nuk\u0303 = a\u22123 \u016bk\u0303\n\n(51)\n\n(2)\n\nIn this commonly used field variable, the action SS,\u03b2 for scalar fluctuations, Eq.

(35,37) when modifying the commutation relations: consider the\nformal position and momentum operators in the operator A(\u03c4 ). We could have used the first quantization's\ncanonical commutation relations to arbitrarily re-order the positions and momenta. Clearly, it does matter,\nhowever, whether we do this before or after we change the first quantization's commutation relations. In\n11\n\n\fthis way, for example by adding terms of the form (xp \u2212 px \u2212 ih\u0304)f (x, p) before changing the commutation\nrelations, we could have introduced into the action arbitrary terms that vanish as the minimum length is set\nto zero, i.e. as \u03b2 \u2192 0.\n\nOf course, in any theory that generalizes quantum field theory by introducing a minimum length pa-\n\nrameter one can guess Hamiltonians and actions etc. only up to terms that vanish as the minimum length\nparameter vanishes - much like quantum Hamiltonians can be guessed from classical Hamiltonians only up to\nterms that vanish as h\u0304 \u2192 0. We encountered essentially an instance of Dirac's observation that quantization\nremoves degeneracy. As in the case of quantization, the minimalist approach to dealing with the ambiguity is\n\nto bring the action into a simple form and to not use the ambiguity to introduce by hand any such terms that\nwould vanish as the minimum length is set to zero. This was the approach tacitly adopted in [8] and we here\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(1)\n\nalso adopted the same minimalist approach when we introduced the minimum length into SS , SS , ST and\n(2)\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nST . We then found that actions SS,\u03b2 and SS,\u03b2 (and similarly ST,\u03b2 , ST,\u03b2 ) yield differing equations of motion.\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nHow could this happen, given that the two actions SS and SS (and similarly ST , ST ) are equivalent?\nWe already indicated that the answer traces back to the fact that the actions in the two formulations\nof types S (1) and S (2) are equivalent only up to a boundary term. After the minimum length is introduced\n(2)\n\nthese terms are no longer boundary terms. To see that this is the case, consider the scalar actions SS,\u03b2 in\n(42) as expressed in terms of the field uk\u0303 . Note that it possesses in its integration measure a time-dependent\nfactor\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c4 d3 k\u0303 \u03ba(\u03c4, k\u0303)\n\n(63)\n\nIf we remove the minimum length, \u03b2 \u2192 0, we obtain of course \u03ba \u2192 1. In the case \u03b2 > 0, however, if\nZ\nZ\nd\n3\nf (\u03c4 )\nd\u03c4 d k\u0303 \u2206L = d\u03c4 d3 k\u0303\nd\u03c4\n\n(64)\n\nis a negligible boundary term arising from a total time derivative, then in the presence of the minimum\nlength uncertainty relation\nZ\n\n3\n\nd\u03c4 d k\u0303 \u03ba(\u03c4, k\u0303) \u2206L =\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c4 d3 k\u0303 \u03ba(\u03c4, k\u0303)\n\nd\nf (\u03c4 )\nd\u03c4\n\n(65)\n\nis not a boundary term. The same phenomenon occurs for tensor fluctuations: the two actions which are\nnormally equivalent because differing merely by the total time derivative \u25b3ST given in Eq. (27 now yield\n\ndifferent equations of motion.

The term d of the ambiguity is dominated by \u03bc and a\u2032\u2032 /a throughout the evolution.\nin the scalar and tensor cases respectively. Let us now compare, for example, the equations of motion for\ntensors - the situation is completely analogous for scalars. How significant is the term d(\u03c4, k\u0303) =\n\na\u2032 \u03ba \u2032\na\u03ba\n\nby\n\u2032\u2032\n\nwhich the two equations (60) and (62) differ? The term d competes with the two other \"mass\" terms, a /a\n\u2032\u2032\n\nand \u03bc. In Fig.1, the magnitudes of the terms d, aa and \u03bc are compared by plotting the logarithm of their\nabsolute values against conformal time. We chose the de Sitter background with a realistic Planck length to\nHubble length ratio of \u03c3 = 10\u22125 . In de Sitter space all k\u0303 modes evolve in the same way and we arbitrarily\nchose k\u0303 = 1. The curves start at the creation time \u03c4c of the mode and end at future infinity \u03c4 = 0. There\nare three distinct phases in a mode's evolution:\nA) In the initial phase close to the creation time, the behavior of the differential equation is dominated\nby the terms \u03bc and d which both appear to diverge. (The function a\u2032 /a is regular at \u03c4c since the creation\ntime of a particular mode is not a special time for the scale factor.) The behavior at creation time is crucial,\nhowever, because this is where the initial conditions for the mode are to be set by some suitable criterion\nfor choosing the vacuum state of the system. We need to determine, therefore, the relative magnitudes of\n\n13\n\n\fd and \u03bc as \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4c+ . To this end, let us consider \u03bc as a function of the inverse proper wavelength \u03c1, as in\nEq. (50). This shows that \u03bc is indeed divergent when the proper wavelength 1/\u03c1 approaches the minimum\n\u221a\nwavelength \u03b2, i.e. at the creation time \u03c4c (Eq. (50) also shows that \u03bc \u2192 k 2 at late times, as expected).\n\nNow a straightforward calculation yields for the ratio of the functions d and \u03bc:\n\u0001\nd(\u03c4, k\u0303)\n= \u2212 \u03c3 2 5 + 3 W (\u2212k 2 \u03c3 2 \u03c4 2 )\n\u03bc(\u03c4, k\u0303)\n\n(68)\n\nThe range of the Lambert W function is the finite interval [\u22121, 0]. Thus, since \u03bc is divergent at \u03c4c , also d is\ndivergent at \u03c4c . However, Eq. (68) also implies that at all times the term d is much smaller than the term \u03bc,\nnamely by a factor \u03c3 2 , up to a pre-factor of order one. Since \u03bc dominates d by a factor of order \u03c3 2 , criteria\nfor determining the mode's initial condition at \u03c4c are generally only correspondingly weakly affected by the\npresence or absence of the term d.\nB) The initial period is followed by an adiabatic period in which all three terms \u03bc, d and a\u2032\u2032 /a are slowly\nvarying. This phase lasts until horizon crossing. In order to estimate the effect of the term d on the time\np\np\nevolution in this phase we compare the oscillation frequencies \u03a9d = \u03bc \u2212 a\u2032\u2032 /a \u2212 d and \u03a90 = \u03bc \u2212 a\u2032\u2032 /a\n\nin the adiabatic phase with and without the term d respectively. During the adiabatic phase we can neglect\n\nthe term a\u2032\u2032 /a and we can set \u03bc \u2248 k\u0303 2 to obtain: \u03a9d /\u03a90 = (1 \u2212 d/(2\u03bc)) + O(d2 /\u03bc2 ), i.e. \u03a9d \u2248 \u03a90 (1 + b\u03c3 2 )\n\nand thus \u2206\u03a9 \u2248 bk\u0303\u03c3 2 where b is of order one. In principle, this frequency shift alters the number N of\n\noscillations during the duration of the second phase. In order to estimate N , we note that the k\u0303 mode is\n\ncreated at the time \u03c4c = \u2212 H k\u03031\u221ae\u03b2 ; the duration, T , of the second phase is comparable to this and so is of\n\u221a\n\u221a\nthe order of T \u2248 H k\u03031\u221ae\u03b2 . Recall that \u03c3 \u2248 1.62 \u03b2H, which implies T \u2248 1.62/(k\u0303\u03c3 e). Thus, in the course\nof the adiabatic second phase, the presence or absence of the term d implies approximately N more or fewer\n\noscillations, where\nN \u2248 \u2206\u03a9 T \u2248\n\n1.62 b k\u0303 \u03c3 2\n\u2248\u03c3\n\u221a\nk\u0303\u03c3 e\n\n(69)\n\nwhich is far less than a single oscillation.\nC) The last period, from horizon crossing to the infinite future \u03c4 \u2192 0 is not clearly resolved in our plot.\n\nIt is the period when the term a\u2032\u2032 /a diverges and entirely dominates the \u03bc and d terms since they stay finite.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nWhile the framework of quantum field theory is well-tested down to distances of about 10\u221218 m, it is generally\nexpected that there are corrections due to quantum gravity when approaching the Planck length of about\n10\u221235 m which may well constitute a fundamental smallest length in nature.\nIf, therefore, there exists a finite minimum wavelength then, during inflation, comoving modes are continually being created. Initially, a new comoving mode will evolve under the influence of Planck scale effects\nbut it is clear that at late times a comoving mode's equation of motion will reduce to the usual low-energy\nmode equation, namely when the mode's proper wavelength becomes much larger than the minimum length.\nThus, as was pointed out in [25], effects of the Planck scale can propagate into the observable low energy\nrealm essentially only by selecting a solution of the mode equation which at late times differs from the usually\nassumed solution for the usual mode equation.\n\n14\n\n\fThis suggests a simple technique for exploring possible effects that Planck scale physics could have on\ninflationary predictions for the CMB. Assume that standard quantum field theory holds unchanged down\nto the minimum wavelength where modes are being created. Then, consider a variety of possible initial\nconditions for the newly created modes by applying candidate criteria for identifying the vacuum state.\nIt is clear that in the time translation invariant de Sitter case all effects reduce to merely an overall renormalization of the flat spectrum (if each mode's initial condition is chosen by applying the same criterion).\nWhen the Hubble parameter varies, however, then modes oscillate a variable number of times before crossing\nthe horizon. Thus, generically, a mode's amplitude will be alternatingly large and small when crossing the\nhorizon. This can lead to potentially observable characteristic oscillations in the spectrum [20]. In this\napproach, quantum field theory is implicitly assumed to hold unchanged down to the Planck scale and\ntherefore Planck scale physics is modelled so as to affect the predictions of inflation, for any given evolution\nof the scale factor a(\u03c4 ), merely through the initial conditions. In any realistic model, of course, the quantum\nfield theoretic mode equations will be modified when approaching the Planck scale. This too will have an\neffect on the number of oscillations that a mode undergoes before horizon crossing and it will therefore\ncontribute to the predicted oscillations of the CMB spectra.\nHere, we considered a concrete model for how quantum field theory is modified when approaching the\nPlanck length, namely by introducing the minimum length uncertainty principle. The equations of motion\nthen indeed became modified at scales close to the Planck scale. As was shown in [9, 10, 11], the inflationary\npredictions for the CMB are to some extent affected, possibly leading to observable oscillations in the\nfluctuation spectra. However, while the equations of motion are known, the details of the predictions still\nsignificantly depend on precisely which initial condition is chosen, i.e. on the identification of the vacuum.\nAs yet, it is not fully understood in any model how Planck scale physics determines the initial conditions\nof modes as they are being created, i.e. when their proper wave length is the minimum length. Within our\nmodel of spacetime, in which there is a minimum length uncertainty relation, the problem of determining the\ninitial conditions for new comoving modes is further complicated by the fact that the mode equation possesses\nan irregular singular point at the initial time, see [8, 9, 10, 11]. So far, in the literature, a mathematical\nargument based on analyticity [9] and a physical argument based on similarity to the Bunch Davies vacuum\n[10, 11] have been discussed and the implications for the CMB have been investigated. Nevertheless, the\ncrucial problem of determining the initial state of modes when they emerge from the Planck scale in an\nexpansion is still essentially unsolved.\nTherefore, we here reconsidered the conventional approach to fixing the vacuum: introduce new variables\nin terms of which the action resembles that of a Minkowski space theory with variable mass - a theory for\nwhich the correct vacuum is known. Interestingly, we found that introducing the minimum length into this\nreformulated action does not yield the same theory - the action and the equations of motion differ slightly.\nThis raised the question as to the extent to which any predictions are affected by this ambiguity.\nLet us, therefore, recall the mechanism that leads to the prediction of characteristic oscillations in the\nCMB spectra due to the minimum length uncertainty relation. The modulus of the mode solution oscillates\nbefore horizon crossing if it deviates from the adiabatic solution. In the case of non-de Sitter inflation,\nmodes then cross the Hubble horizon alternatingly with small and large amplitudes and this translates into\nthe prediction of oscillations in the CMB spectra. The oscillations are the more pronounced the more the\n\n15\n\n\fsolutions deviate from the usual adiabatic vacuum in the phase preceding horizon crossing. For the minimum\nlength uncertainty relation an effect of order \u03c3 appears possible [10, 11]. This depends, of course, on the\nchoice of initial condition.\nOn the basis of the current experimental approaches, it is clear that, at best, only effects on the CMB\nspectrum that are of order \u03c3 might become observable over the foreground. Effects of order \u03c3 2 must be\nexpected to compete with numerous other effects such as those due to backreaction and the nonlinearity of\ngravity. We found that in the mode equation the term \u03bc dominates the ambiguous term d by a factor \u03c3 2 .\nOn the one hand, this means that the ambiguous term's effect on the amplitude of the minimum-lengthinduced characteristic oscillations in the CMB spectra is very small. This is because any generic criterion\nfor choosing the modes' initial condition should be affected only to the order of \u03c3 2 . We note, however, that\none might of course conceive of special initial conditions that are arbitrarily different for the two cases. For\nany generic criterion for initial conditions, the modes' deviation from the adiabatic solution is, therefore\ncorrespondingly little affected by whether one starts from the actions of type S (1) or those of the type S (2) .\nOn the other hand, this leaves open the possibility that the phases of the predicted characteristic oscillations\nin the CMB spectra are affected by the ambiguous term d. Indeed, the term d implies a small frequency\nshift for the mode in the period before horizon crossing. We found, however, that the shift in the oscillation\nfrequency accumulates only to a small fraction (\u03c3 \u2248 10\u22125 ) of a single oscillation (whose amplitude is itself\n\nat most of order \u03c3) over the entire adiabatic phase.\n\nTo summarize, choosing either the actions of type S (1) or the actions of type S (2) generically leads to\npractically indistinguishable predictions for the effect of the minimum length uncertainty relation on the\nCMB. Nevertheless, the two actions S (1) or S (2) are actually different and the much-sought-after precise\nphysical criterion for identifying the newly created modes's initial condition may be sensitive to the correct\nchoice of equation of motion. We draw the lesson, therefore, that great care must be taken when introducing\na further fundamental constant such as a minimum length into quantum field theory: even if, as usual,\nordering ambiguities are resolved by adopting the minimalist approach, previously harmless reformulations\nof the theory up to a boundary term can lead to an actual change in the theory.\nIn the particular case at hand one may try to circumvent the problem by starting from the most plausible\nactions, i.e. those of type S (1) , introducing the minimum length and only then reformulating the theory such\nas to resemble a Minkowski space theory with variable mass. Even this approach faces difficulties due to\nthe introduction of a minimum length scale, however. To see this, note that, usually, modes can be followed\narbitrarily far back in the past to when their proper wave length was arbitrarily short and therefore essentially\nunaffected by curvature, yielding an arbitrarily close match with Minkowski space. With a minimum length,\nhowever, the initial conditions must be chosen when the proper wavelength of the mode is the cutoff length.\nAt that time, unavoidably, the match with the Minkowski case is imprecise. In addition, a further redefinition\nof the field variable followed by a suitable redefinition of the time variable could preserve the appearance\nof a free field theory on flat space with a time-dependent mass. This would modify, however, the generator\nof time evolution, i.e. the Hamiltonian. This can affect Hamiltonian-based criteria for picking the vacuum\nstate; a similar point was made in [26]. An example of a criterion for choosing the vacuum that does not\nrely on the Hamiltonian, but on field uncertainties instead, was given in [19, 20]. It should be interesting to\napply this criterion in the case of the minimum length uncertainty relation.\n\n16\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nThe authors are thankful to W. H. Kinney and R. H.
