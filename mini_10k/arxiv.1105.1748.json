Since\nthere is no symmetry change of the quantum state involved, the system exhibits the well-known BCS-BEC\ncrossover.\nIn the special case corresponding to the diverging scattering length, as \u2192 \u221e, the system is in a strongly interacting regime called the unitary limit. In this regime the\ninterparticle spacing rs is the only relevant scale, and\nthe rest of the quantities are universal and system independent. The total energy of this system can be conveniently written as E = \u03beEfree , where Efree is the energy\nof the non-interacting atomic gas and \u03be is a system independent parameter. Experimental measurements of \u03be\nhave been performed using 6 Li and 40 K atoms by investigating the expansion rate of the atomic cloud and the\nsound propagation in it[8\u201312]. Simultaneously, a number\nof theoretical and numerical estimations of \u03be have been\nreported, including diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) [13\u201318]\nas well as path integral Monte Carlo, lattice simulations\nand analytical methods[18\u201327]. The resulting estimates\nfall between \u2248 0.25\u20130.45 showing that the actual value\nhas not been settled yet and is still of significant interest\ndue to the universal nature of the unitary limit.\nOne of the most interesting properties of the unitary\ngas is the robust presence of the pairing condensate which\ninvolves a large fraction of the system. The study of pairing effects is thus much more straightforward than, say,\nin superconducting materials, where only a sliver of the\n\nfermions around the Fermi level forms the condensate\nand the attractive interaction is much more complicated.\nThe quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods have the advantage that the condensate can be detected directly, by\nevaluating the off-diagonal two-particle density matrix\nand by monitoring its behavior at large distances [16, 18].\nThe goal of our study is twofold. First, any actual simulation involves only a finite system, and the quantities\nrelevant for the thermodynamic limit have to be obtained\nfrom appropriate extrapolations. The unitary system is\nnot trivial in this respect, since pairing with infinite scattering length is described by a function with a slow fall-off\nat large distances. It is necessary to analyze the finite-size\nscaling of the quantities of interest and to test whether\nthe actual limit of infinite dilution, or, equivalently, of\npoint-like character of the interaction, has indeed been\nreached. Second, the impact of the fixed-node approximation in the quantum Monte Carlo method is not very\nwell understood for this system since there is nothing to\ncompare with: so far the fixed-node formulation of the\nQMC methods appears to be the only approach that is\nable to provide an upper bound for the total energy. This\nhas motivated us to probe the accuracy of the nodes by\nreleased-node QMC simulations and by improvements in\nthe variational flexibility of the employed wave functions.\nWe have carried out calculations of the ground-state\nproperties of the dilute unitary Fermi gas by the fixednode DMC (FN-DMC)[28] method for 4, 14, 38 and 66\natoms. By using a more versatile construction of the pair\norbital in the BCS wave function and by extrapolating\nthe effective range of the two-particle interactions Reff\nto zero, we were able to obtain lower \u03be than, for example, the previously reported DMC calculations in Ref.\n[13] based on BCS trial functions. These results suggest\nthat the extrapolation of Reff is important, especially for\nsmaller systems. In order to test the quality of the nodal\nsurface of the BCS wave function, we have performed\nreleased-node DMC (RN-DMC)[29, 30] calculations for\n\n\f2\n4 and 14 atoms. This procedure has been carried out\nstarting from two types of nodal constraints: from the\nBCS nodes and from the Hartree-Fock (HF) nodes. Our\nRN-DMC results indicate that the nodal corrections are\ndriven mainly by long-range correlations which are difficult to sample in the released-node framework due to the\nrapid growth of the bosonic noise. We have calculated\nalso the two-body density matrix and the condensate\nfraction for the 66 atom system, and we have estimated\nthe corrections from the effective-range extrapolation on\nthese quantities.\nII.\nA.\n\nMETHOD\nHamiltonian\n\nWe consider a two-component Fermi gas with Hamiltonian\nH=\u2212\n\nN/2\nN/2\n1X 2 1X 2 X\n\u2207i \u2212\n\u2207i0 +\nV (rii0 ) ,\n2 i=1\n2 0\n0\ni =1\n\n(1)\n\ni,i\n\nwhere N is the total number of atoms, i and i0 correspond\nto the spin-up and spin-down atoms, and rii0 denotes the\ndistance |ri \u2212 ri0 |. The atoms are located in a cubic box\nwith the side L and we impose the periodic boundary\nconditions. The two-particle potential V (rii0 ) is taken in\nthe P\u00f6schl-Teller form\nV (rii0 ) = \u2212\n\n2\u03bc2\n,\ncosh2 (\u03bcrii0 )\n\n(2)\n\nThe pair orbital \u03c6(ri , ri0 ) in \u03a8BCS is written as a linear\ncombination of Gaussian functions\n\u03c6(ri , ri0 ) =\n\n1\nX\n\nX\n\n0\n\n2\n\ndk e\u2212\u03b1k (xi \u2212xi +lL)\n\nl,m,n=\u22121 k\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\u00d7 e\u2212\u03b1k (yi \u2212yi +mL) e\u2212\u03b1k (zi \u2212zi +nL) , (6)\nwhere dk are expansion coefficients, and ri = (xi , yi , zi )\nand ri0 = (xi0 , yi0 , zi0 ) are coordinates of i and i0 atoms\ninside the simulation box of linear size L. We choose sufficiently large exponents \u03b1k so that only the first neighbor\nshell of periodic images contributes to the sum, that is,\nthe Gaussian functions are negligible at distances larger\nthan 3L/2. The pair orbital is smooth with zero derivative at the boundary of the simulation cell. The Jastrow\nfactor J(R) is constructed in a similar way as the pair\norbital \u03c6(ri , ri0 ) for both different spin atoms and same\nspin atoms.\nA typical trial wave function includes around 30 to\n40 variational parameters that are optimized by minimizing a linear combination of the total energy and\nits variance[31]. Although the Jastrow factor does not\nchange the nodal surface, accurate description of the pair\ncorrelations makes the variational optimization much\nmore efficient and robust. When the effective range of the\npotential approaches zero, more Gaussian functions with\nlarger exponents \u03b1k are included in the Jastrow factor in\norder to keep the accuracy of the trial function consistently high. On the other hand, and somewhat surprisingly, we find that similar adjustment of the pair orbital\nwith the changing effective range is relatively minor.\n\nwhose effective range is Reff = 2/\u03bc. The s-wave scattering length as is infinite for all values of \u03bc 6= 0.\nC.\nB.\n\nTrial wave functions\n\n(3)\n\nThe DMC method projects out the ground state from\na given trial function \u03a8T by means of an auxiliary evolution in the imaginary time, \u03a6(\u03c4 ) \u223c exp(\u2212\u03c4 H)\u03a8T . By\nintroducing importance sampling[28] with the aid of a\nguiding function \u03a8G , we can write an integral equation\nfor \u03a6(R, \u03c4 ) in the form\n\n(4)\n\n\u03a8G (R)\u03a6(R, \u03c4 + \u2206\u03c4 ) =\nZ\n\u03a8G (R)\nG(R, R0 , \u2206\u03c4 )\u03a8G (R0 )\u03a6(R0 , \u03c4 ) . (7)\ndR0\n\u03a8G (R0 )\n\nIn the majority of our calculations we employ trial\nwave functions of the BCS form multiplied with the Jastrow factor (BCS-Jastrow) as given by\n\u03a8T (R) = \u03a8BCS (R)eJ(R) ,\nwhere\n\u0014 N/2\n\u0015\nY\n\u03a8BCS (R) = A\n\u03c6(ri , ri0 ) = det[\u03c6(ri , ri0 )] .\n\nFixed-node and released-node DMC methods\n\ni,i0 =1\n\nHere A represents the antisymmetrization operator and\n\u03c6(ri , ri0 ) is the pair orbital. The vector R encompasses all atomic coordinates ri and ri0 . Additionally, we\nhave carried out a subset of calculations also with the\nHartree-Fock-Jastrow (HF-Jastrow) trial functions, in\nwhich \u03a8BCS is replaced with a product of two Slater determinants of one-particle orbitals (simple plane waves).\nThe HF-Jastrow wave function reads as\nJ(R)\n\n\u03a8SJ (R) = det[\u03c6a (ri )] det[\u03c6a (ri0 )]e\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\nFor small \u2206\u03c4 , the propagator G(R, R0 , \u2206\u03c4 ) can be approximated using the Trotter-Suzuki formula as\n\u03a8G (R)\nG(R, R0 , \u2206\u03c4 ) \u2248 G0 (R, R0 + \u2206\u03c4 v(R0 ), \u2206\u03c4 )\n\u03a8G (R0 )\n0\n\n\u00d7 e\u2212\u2206\u03c4 [EL (R)+EL (R )\u22122ET ]/2 , (8)\nwhere v(R0 ) \u2261 \u2207 ln |\u03a8G (R0 )| and G0 (R, R0 , \u2206\u03c4 ) is the\nGreen's function for non-interacting atoms that takes the\n\n\f0.25\n0.245\n0.24\n0.235\n0.23\n0.225\n0.22\n0.215\n0.21\n\nrs=15.63\n\u03be7,7\n\n\u03be2,2\n\n3\n\nFN-DMC\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.435\n0.43\n0.425\n0.42\n0.415\n0.41\n0.405\n\n0.15\n\nFN-DMC\n\n0\n\nrs=10\n\nFN-DMC\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\nReff/rs\n\n\u03be33,33\n\n\u03be19,19\n\nReff/rs\n0.435\n0.43\n0.425\n0.42\n0.415\n0.41\n0.405\n\nand fermionic states.

(7) and (8). In the fixed-node method we set\n\u03a8G (R) = \u03a8T (R) and the fixed-node condition is imposed by enforcing the sampling points to obey\n\u03a8G (R)\u03a6(R, \u03c4 ) \u2265 0\n\nRESULTS\n\n(10)\n\nat all times. In the limit of long \u03c4 the solution converges towards the lowest-energy state consistent with\nthe boundary conditions given by the fixed nodes.\nIn the RN-DMC method the guiding function has\nbosonic symmetry and its square should be close to the\nsquare of the fermionic ground state. We have used guiding functions in the form[30, 32]\nq\n\u03a8G (R) = \u03a82T (R) + \u03b1 h\u03a82T i ,\n(11)\nwhere \u03a82T is the average value of \u03a82T (R0 ) over all configurations, and R0 are the walker positions right after\nthe nodal release. The tunable parameter \u03b1 controls the\nrate of walkers passing through the nodal region. The\nguiding function is non-negative everywhere and therefore the stochastic process propagates a mix of bosonic\n\nFor benchmark purposes we first calculate perhaps the\nsmallest nontrivial system-four atoms. Our result is\nshown in Fig. 1, upper left panel. There is approximately\n10% energy drop when Reff /rs is reduced from 0.1279 to\n0.003998. We extrapolate Reff to zero using a linear fit\nand obtain \u03be2,2 = 0.212(2). Here and in the rest of the\npaper, the denominator Efree in the ratio \u03be = E/Efree is\nevaluated in the same finite volume subject to the same\nboundary conditions as the nominator E.\nThe ground-state energy of this small and relatively\nsimple system was obtained also by two other numerical\nmethods using a lattice formulation of the unitary Fermi\ngas model: the iterative Lanczos diagonalization and the\nauxiliary-field projection Monte Carlo method[33]. The\nagreement between our fixed-node DMC results and the\noutcome of these entirely different methods strongly suggests that our range-extrapolated total energy of the\nfour-atom system is very accurate. This conclusion is\nfurther corroborated by our released-node DMC results\ndiscussed below.\nOur calculations with 14, 38 and 66 atoms are carried out analogously to the 4-atom case, and the extrapolated values of \u03be are 0.407(2), 0.409(3) and 0.398(3),\nrespectively, as plotted in Fig. 1. In these calculations,\nthe smallest effective range is Reff /rs = 0.003125. It\nshould be noted that in the previous DMC calculations,\nthe range of Reff /rs was between 0.1 to 0.2, and within\n\n\f4\n1.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.2\n\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9\n\n0\n\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9\n\nr/L\n\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9\n\nr/L\n\n0.26\n\n0.238\n\nFN-DMC\n\nFN-DMC\n\nFN-DMC \u03b1=0.5\n\n0.255\n\nRN-DMC \u03b1=0.5\n\n0.236\n\nFN-DMC \u03b1=0.2\n\n\u03b1=0.2\n\n0.234\n\n\u03b1=0.05\n\n\u03b1=0.05\n\n0.232\n\n\u03b1=0.01\n\nRN-DMC \u03b1=0.5\n\n0.23\n\nRN-DMC \u03b1=0.2\n\n\u03b1=0.2\n\n0.228\n\n\u03b1=0.05\n\n0.25\n0.245\n\nFN-DMC\n\nFN-DMC \u03b1=0.5\n\n0.28\n\n\u03be2,2\n\n0\n\nr/L\n\n0.3\n0.29\n\n\u03c6 111\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0\n\n\u03c6 110\n\n0.8\n\n\u03c6 111\n\n0.6\n\n\u03c6 100\n\n1\n\n\u03c6 110\n\n0.8\n\n\u03c6 111\n\n0.6\n\n1.2\n\n\u03c6 100\n\n1\n\n\u03c6 110\n\n0.8\n\n\u03c6(r)\n\n1.2\n\n\u03c6 100\n\n1\n\n0.27\n0.24\n\n\u03b1=0.05\n\n0.26\n\n\u03b1=0.01\n\n0.226\n\n0.235\n0.224\n0.25\n\n0.23\n\nFN\n\nFN\n\nRN\n\n0.24\n\n0.222\n\nRN\n\n0.225\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\nFN\n\nRN\n\n0.22\n0\n\n0.1\n\nEFt\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\nEFt\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\nEFt\n\nFIG. 2. The pair orbitals and FN-DMC and RN-DMC energies of the 4-atom unitary system with Reff /rs = 0.06397. The\nupper row shows the pair orbitals with the lowest (left), intermediate (middle) and optimal (right) accuracy with regard to the\nvariational optimization. The lower row shows the corresponding DMC energies as functions of the projection time starting\nfrom the variational estimate. Note that the resolution of the left and right panels differs by an order of magnitude. The\nvertical dotted lines indicate the instant of the nodal release.\n\nthis range our DMC results agree well with the previously\nobtained values [14, 15, 18]. Reduction of Reff decreases\nthe energy in all cases although the decrease per atom is\nsmaller in larger systems.\nTo test the quality of the nodal surfaces, we have carried out released-node calculations for 4-atom and 14atom systems. The RN-DMC calculations for 4 atoms\nwere done with Reff /rs = 0.06397. In a typical releasednode run the number of walkers was about two million\nso that the error bars were initially very small. In Fig. 2,\nthe upper row shows the pair orbital along three distinct\ndirections (100, 110 and 111) of the interparticle distance vector ri \u2212 rj . The lower row shows the FN-DMC\nand RN-DMC energies as they evolve with the projection\ntime. The plots show convergence of the FN-DMC energy followed by the nodal release. This is accomplished\nby switching the guiding wave function from \u03a8T (R) to\nthe bosonic function \u03a8G (R) defined in Eq. (11).\nThe released-node signal reflects the quality of the\nnodal surface of the trial wave function employed in the\nFN-DMC simulation. We have tested wave functions\nwith intentionally varied accuracy by employing suboptimal pair orbitals. The plot of the energy evolution in\nthe left panel of Fig. 2 shows a clear and pronounced\ndrop after the nodal release. As the quality of the pair\norbital improves, this drop shrinks. For the fully op-\n\ntimized BCS-Jastrow wave function (the right panel in\nFig. 2) the energy is reduced by less than 0.002 within\nthe longest projection time we have tried. This fact as\nwell as comparison with other methods[33] indicate that\nour BCS wave functions are very accurate in this small\nsystem and that the fixed-node error is marginal.\nWe observe an unexpectedly high sensitivity of the\nnodal quality to the details of the pair orbital at large\ndistances. This suggests an explanation for the relatively slow convergence of the released-node energy: the\nlong-range tails of the pair orbital affect the nodal hypersurfaces, although their contribution to the total energy is relatively small. One can further deduce that this\nmakes the released-node method quite challenging to apply since it requires sampling of long distances and the\ncorresponding correlations. This is, however, difficult to\nachieve because the diffusive motion of walkers is slow,\nproportional to t1/2 , while the growth of the noise is fast,\nproportional to exp(\u2206BF t) where \u2206BF is the difference\nbetween the bosonic and fermionic ground-state energies.\nThe time step \u2206\u03c4 was set to 4 \u00d7 10\u22125 rs2 in all runs\nand we have verified that the time-step bias of the RNDMC results is negligible. The converged RN-DMC energy should not depend on the parameter \u03b1 in the bosonic\nguiding function \u03a8G provided one would be able to evolve\nthe stochastic process with the error bars under control\n\n\f5\n\n\u03be7,7\n\n0.45\n\n0.56\n\nFN-DMC\nFN-DMC \u03b1=5e-7\n\u03b1=1e-7\n\u03b1=5e-8\nRN-DMC \u03b1=5e-7\n\u03b1=1e-7\n\u03b1=5e-8\n\nFN-DMC\nFN-DMC \u03b1=1e-3\n\u03b1=5e-4\n\u03b1=1e-4\nRN-DMC \u03b1=1e-3\n\u03b1=5e-4\n\u03b1=1e-5\n\nHF\n0.55\n\n\u03be7,7\n\nBCS\n\n0.46\n\n0.44\n\n0.54\n0.53\n\n0.43\n0.52\n\nFN\n\n0.42\n\nRN\n\nFN\n\nRN\n\n0.51\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\nEFt\n\nuntil the full convergence. In the same time, the parameter \u03b1 crucially affects the growth of the fluctuations with\nthe projection time as illustrated in Fig. 2.\nThe RN-DMC energy for 14 atoms with Reff /rs = 0.2\nis shown in Fig. 3. The error bars are estimated from\neight independent runs with two million walkers each. In\nthe interval of EF t \u2264 0.2 after the nodal release the RNDMC energy gain appears to be very small and the error\nbars preclude to make any statistically sound estimation\nfor longer projection times. The rapid loss of resolution\nis expected since the difference between the bosonic and\nfermionic ground states grows with the number of atoms.\nAgain, the RN-DMC signal exhibits little dependence on\n\u03b1 we choose.\nIn order to make a comparison with a case displaying a\nclear fixed-node bias, we have carried out RN-DMC runs\nusing the Slater-Jastrow trial wave function, see Fig. 4.\nSince this wave function has the nodal surface of the noninteracting Fermi gas, the nodal surface is strongly distorted. As a result, we see a very pronounced releasednode signal. However, within the projection time interval of EF t \u2264 0.2, the energy drops by only \u2248 0.015 for\nthe largest \u03b1 we tested. This is very small considering\nthat the true ground-state energy is at least an order of\nmagnitude lower. This again illustrates the challenges\nof efficient application of the released-node method, at\nleast for present cases. Comparison of the Slater and\nBCS wave functions shows a significant effect of pairing\nas was demonstrated in earlier studies[13].\nIn order to quantify the pairing effects we calculate\nthe two-body density matrix which enable us to evaluate\nthe condensate fraction.

The density matrices have\nbeen calculated for the fixed-node wave functions and\nhence they correspond to the mixed estimators [28]. Nevertheless, the mixed-estimator bias is negligible since the\nvariational Monte Carlo and DMC estimates of \u03c1(2) coincide within error bars.

We show that the interaction range impacts the resulting total energies significantly. By extrapolating the interaction range to zero we obtain the\nratio E/Efree for 4, 14, 38 and 66 atoms to be 0.212(2),\n0.407(2), 0.409(3) and 0.398(3), respectively. Our results\nagree well with the previous fixed-node DMC calculations\nwhen we employ similar simulation parameters such as\nthe atom density, the interaction range and the number\nof atoms. From the released-node DMC calculations for\n4 and 14 atoms we have found that the convergence to\nthe correct and asymptotically exact ground-state energies is unfavorably slow compared to the growth of the\nstatistical noise. We were able to identify only small energy gains within the simulation times that allowed for\nacceptable signal to noise ratio. We have calculated the\ntwo-body density matrix and the condensate fraction in\nthe limit of zero interaction range, and we have found\nonly small changes in these quantities when compared\nwith the previous calculations. Our condensate fraction\nfrom the fixed-node DMC simulations is 0.56(1).\nDuring the preparation of our manuscript we became\naware of a similar study where an interaction-range extrapolation was also performed[34]. The final result for\nthe 66-atom system was \u03be33,33 = 0.383(2), which is approximately 4% lower than ours. We believe that a large\nportion of this difference can be attributed to differences\nin the functional forms of the pairing orbital. Some influence could come also due to the differences between\nthe extrapolation methods employed in this work and in\nRef. [34].\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work is supported by ARO and by the NSF grants\nDMR-0804549 and OCI-0904794.\n\n(1998).\n[8] M. Bartenstein, A. Altmeyer, S. Riedl, S. Jochim,\nC. Chin, J. H.
