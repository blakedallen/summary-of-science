According to a recent survey exploring attitudes towards\nannuitization among individuals approaching retirement in the United Kingdom by Gardner\nand Wadsworth [2004], over half of the individuals in the sample chose not to annuitize given\nthe option. Whether the option was 100% annuitization or only partial (50%) annuitization,\nthe attitude was the same. The dominant reason given for not wanting to annuitize in the\nsurvey is the preference for flexibility. It is well known that annuity income is not reversible.\nIn other words, annuity holders can neither surrender for a refund nor short-sell (borrow\nagainst) their earlier purchased annuities, even when such a deal is desirable.\nIn this paper, we explore a way to add flexibility to life annuities by proposing a financial\ninnovation, specifically a reversible annuity, an immediate life annuity with a surrender option. The option to surrender allows an annuity holder to either borrow against or surrender\nany portion of her annuities at any time when she is still alive. The purchase value of this\nreversible annuity is determined by the expected present value of future payments to the annuity holder, which follows the same principle as regular annuities. The surrender value is set\nas a fixed proportion of its purchase value at the time of surrendering. The surrender value\ncan also be viewed as the purchasing value less a proportional surrender charge, which is a\ncombination of transaction cost, operating charge, and compensation for adverse selection.\nTo explore how this reversible annuity would work for retirees as a reliable flow of income, as\nwell as an asset able to be surrendered under certain personal circumstance, we investigate\nthe optimal investment strategy and optimal annuity purchase and surrender strategies for\nan individual who seeks to minimize the probability that she outlives her wealth, also called\nthe probability of lifetime ruin. In other words, we assume that the retiree consumes at a\nexogenous level, and we determine the optimal investment strategy, as well as the optimal\ntime to annuitize or to surrender, in order to minimize the probability that wealth will reach\nzero before her death.\nAs a risk metric, the probability of lifetime ruin is widely used to investigate optimization problems faced by retirees in a financial market. This metric was first introduced by\nMilevsky and Robinson [2000] in a static environment and was extended by Young [2004] to\na stochastic environment without immediate life annuities. A recent paper by Milevsky et al.\n[2006] determined the optimal dynamic investment policy for an individual who consumes\nat a specific rate, who invests in a complete financial market, and who can buy irreversible\nimmediate life annuities. Milevsky, Moore, and Young show that the individual will not annuitize any of her wealth until she can fully cover her desired consumption with an immediate\nlife annuity. Additionally, Bayraktar and Young [2009] investigate the optimal strategy for an\nretiree in a financial market with deferred (not immediate) life annuities. Within the topic of\nminimizing probability of lifetime ruin in a complete financial market without life annuities,\nBayraktar et al. [2008] consider the case for which the exogenous consumption is random,\nand in Bayraktar and Young [2008], consumption is ratcheted (that is, it is a non-decreasing\nfunction of maximum wealth). Bayraktar and Young [2007] investigate the optimal strategy\nwhen consumption level is deterministic but borrowing is constrained.\n\n2\n\n\fIn contrast to the literature mentioned above, we allow an individual not only to buy\nan immediate life annuity, but also to surrender existing immediate life annuities with a\nproportional surrender charge. This reversibility of life annuities and the incompleteness\nof the annuity market (due to the proportional surrender charge) creates a more complex\noptimization environment and makes the problem mathematically challenging. Our model\ncan be viewed as a generalization of the model by Milevsky et al. [2006] in which annuities are\nirreversible, and the limiting case for which the surrender value of existing annuity approaches\nzero is consistent with their study.\nOur work is the first to investigate the optimal strategies for a retiree in a market with\nreversible immediate life annuities. We comprehensively analyze the annuitization and investment strategies for such a retire. We focus on how the proportional surrender charge, which\nranges from 0% to 100% of the purchasing value of annuity, affects an individual's optimal\nstrategies. We predict that, when the surrender charge is low enough, the individual has\nincentive to annuitize partially. This distinguishes our model from the one with irreversible\nannuities, in which an individual is only willing to fully annuitize. This difference shows that\nthe flexibility offered by reversible annuities might be able to resolve the \"annuity puzzle.\"\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we present the financial\nmarket in which the individual invests her wealth. In addition to investing in riskless and\nrisky assets, the individual can purchase reversible immediate life annuities. In Section 3,\nwe consider the life annuity as part of her total wealth, thereby allowing her assets to have\nnegative value as long as the imputed surrender value of her annuity makes her total wealth\npositive. We prove a verification theorem for the minimal probability of lifetime ruin in this\ncase, and we obtain the minimal probability, along with optimal investment and annuitization\nstrategies. In Section 4, we consider the case for which individual is forced to keep the value\nof her riskless and risky assets non-negative (excluding the surrender value of the annuity) by\nsurrendering the annuity when needed. It turns out that the optimal annuitization strategy\ndepends on the size of the proportional surrender charge. We consider the case when the\ncharge is large in Section 4.2.1, and in Section 4.2.2, we discuss the case when the charge is\nsmall.\n\n2\n\nMinimizing the Probability of Lifetime Ruin\n\nIn this section, we describe the financial market in which the individual can invest her wealth,\nand we formulate the problem of minimizing the probability of lifetime ruin in this market.\nWe allow the individual to purchase and surrender her reversible life annuity at any time.\n\n2.1\n\nFinancial model\n\nWe consider an individual with future lifetime described by the random variable \u03c4d . Suppose\n\u03c4d is an exponential random variable with parameter \u03bbS , also referred to as the force of\n3\n\n\fmortality or hazard rate; in particular, E[\u03c4d ] = 1/\u03bbS . The superscript S indicates that the\nparameter equals the individual's subjective belief as to the value of her hazard rate.\nWe assume that the individual consumes wealth at a constant rate of c \u2265 0; this rate might\nbe given in real or nominal units. One can interpret c as the minimum net consumption level\nbelow which the individual cannot (or will not) reduce her consumption further; therefore,\nthe minimum probability of lifetime ruin gives a lower bound for the probability of ruin under\nany consumption function bounded below by c.\nThe individual can invest in a riskless asset, which earns interest at the constant rate\nr \u2265 0. Also, she can invest in a risky asset whose price satisfies\ndSt = \u03bc St dt + \u03c3 St dBt ,\n\nS0 = S > 0,\n\n(2.1)\n\nin which \u03bc > r, \u03c3 > 0, and B is a standard Brownian motion with respect to a filtration\nF = {Ft } of a probability space (\u03a9, F, P). We assume that B is independent of \u03c4d , the\nrandom time of death of the individual. If c is given as a real rate of consumption (that is,\ninflation adjusted), then we also express r and \u03bc as real rates.\nMoreover, an individual can buy any amount of reversible immediate life annuity or\nsurrender any portion of her existing annuity income and receive some fraction of its value.\nThe purchase price of an immediate life annuity that pays $1 per year continuously until the\ninsured's death is given by\nZ\n\u0101 =\n\n\u221e\n\ne\u2212rs e\u2212\u03bb\n\nOs\n\n0\n\nds =\n\n1\n,\nr + \u03bbO\n\n(2.2)\n\nin which \u03bbO > 0 is the constant objective hazard rate that is used to price annuities. In other\nwords, in return for each $a the individual pays for an immediate life annuity, she receives\n$1 per year of continuous annuity income until she dies.\nDue to the reversibility of the life annuity, she can surrender any amount of the annuity\nshe owns. The surrender value for $1 of annuity income is (1 \u2212 p)a with 0 < p \u2264 1. The\nfactor p is the proportional surrender charge. In other words, the individual can get $(1 \u2212 p)a\ndollars from the issuer by giving up $1 of annuity income. Notice that the surrender value is\nless than the purchase price, and the difference is the surrender charge (in dollars).\nLet Wt denote the amount of wealth the individual has invested in the risky and riskless\nassets at time t, with \u03c0t in the risky asset and Wt \u2212 \u03c0t in the riskless. Let A+\nt denote the\n\u2212\ncumulative amount of annuity income bought on or before time t, and let At denote the\n\u2212\ncumulative amount of annuity income surrendered on or before time t. Then, At = A+\nt \u2212 At\nrepresents the cumulative amount of immediate life annuity income at time t. The investment\nand annuitization strategy {\u03c0t , At }t\u22650 is said to be admissible if the processes {\u03c0t }t\u22650 and\nRt 2\n{A\u00b1\nt }t\u22650 are adapted to the filtration F, if 0 \u03c0s ds < \u221e, almost surely, for all t \u2265 0, and\nif At \u2265 0, almost surely, for all t \u2265 0. The wealth dynamics of the individual for a given\n\n4\n\n\fadmissible strategy are given by\n\u2212\ndWt = [rWt\u2212 +(\u03bc\u2212r)\u03c0t\u2212 \u2212c+At\u2212 ]dt+\u03c3\u03c0t\u2212 dBt \u2212\u0101dA+\nt +\u0101(1\u2212p)dAt ,\n\nW0 = w \u2265 0. (2.3)\n\nBy \"lifetime ruin,\" we mean that the individual's wealth reaches the line w = \u2212(1 \u2212 p)\u0101A\nbefore she dies. We denote the time of ruin by \u03c40 , {t \u2265 0 : Wt\u03c0,A + (1 \u2212 p)\u0101A\u03c0,A\n\u2264 0}. In\nt\nSection 3, we allow wealth (namely, the value of the riskless and risky assets) to be negative\nwith the individual effectively borrowing against her annuity income. Then, in Section 4, we\nrequire that wealth remain non-negative. Note that \u03c40 is independent of \u03c4d . The minimum\nprobability of lifetime ruin \u03c8 for the individual at time 0 is defined by\nh\ni\n\u03c8(w, A) , inf P \u03c40 < \u03c4d W0 = w, A0 = A, \u03c4d > 0, \u03c40 > 0 .\n{\u03c0t ,At }\n\n(2.4)\n\nRemark 2.1 Notice that because we assume that the hazard rates \u03bbS and \u03bbO , as well as the\nfinancial parameters r, \u03bc, and \u03c3, are constant, \u03c8 only depends on the state variables w and\nA and not upon time.\nRemark 2.2 We can derive an equivalent form for the minimum probability of ruin due to\nthe independence of the \u03c4d from \u03c40 :\nh\ni\ninf P \u03c40 < \u03c4d W0 = w, A0 = A, \u03c4d > 0, \u03c40 > 0\n{\u03c0t ,At }\n\u0014Z \u221e\n\u0015\nS \u2212\u03bbS t\n=\ninf E\n\u03bb e\n1{0\u2264\u03c40 \u2264t} dt W0 = w, A0 = A, \u03c4d > 0, \u03c40 > 0\n{\u03c0t ,At }\n0\n\u0014Z \u221e\n\u0015\nS \u2212\u03bbS t\n=\ninf E\n\u03bb e\ndt W0 = w, A0 = A, \u03c4d > 0, \u03c40 > 0\n{\u03c0t ,At }\n\u03c40\nh\ni\nS\n=\ninf E e\u2212\u03bb \u03c40 W0 = w, A0 = A, \u03c4d > 0, \u03c40 > 0 .\n(2.5)\n\n\u03c8(w, A) =\n\n{\u03c0t ,At }\n\nWe will use this expression in our proof of verification theorem in next section.\nRemark 2.3 Milevsky et al. [2006] show that if one only allows irreversible life annuities,\nthen the individual will not buy a life annuity until her wealth is large enough to cover all\nher consumption. Specifically, if w \u2265 (c \u2212 A)a, then it is optimal for the individual to spend\n(c \u2212 A)a to buy an immediate annuity that will pay at the continuous rate c \u2212 A for the\nrest of her life. This income, together with the prior income of A, will cover her desired\nconsumption rate of c. In this case, the individual will not ruin, under the convention that\nif her net consumption rate becomes c, then she is not considered ruined even if her wealth\nis 0. (The latter occurs if her wealth is identically (c \u2212 A)a immediately before buying the\nannuity.)\n\n5\n\n\f3\n\nNO BORROWING RESTRICTION\n\nIn this section, we consider the case in which the individual's wealth w is allowed to be\nnegative, as long as w + (1 \u2212 p)\u0101A is positive. Effectively, the individual is allowed to borrow\nagainst her life annuity income.\n\n3.1\n\nMotivation for the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Variational Inequality\n\nLet us first consider the strategies one can choose to minimize the probability of ruin. Before\nruin occurs or the individual dies, she can execute one or more of the following strategies:\n(i) purchase additional annuity income, (ii) surrender existing annuity income, or (iii) do\nneither.\nNow, suppose that at point (w, A), it is optimal not to purchase or surrender any annuity\nincome. In this case, we expect \u03c8 will satisfy the equation\n\u0015\n1 2 2\n\u03bb \u03c8 = (rw \u2212 c + A)\u03c8w + min (\u03bc \u2212 r)\u03c0\u03c8w + \u03c3 \u03c0 \u03c8ww .\n\u03c0\n2\n\u0014\n\nS\n\n(3.1)\n\nBecause the above policy is in general suboptimal, (3.1) holds as an inequality; that is, for\nall (w, A),\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1 2 2\nS\n(3.2)\n\u03bb \u03c8 \u2264 (rw \u2212 c + A)\u03c8w + min (\u03bc \u2212 r)\u03c0\u03c8w + \u03c3 \u03c0 \u03c8ww .\n\u03c0\n2\nAs we shall prove later, no continuous purchase of lifetime annuity income is optimal;\nthat is, the problem of purchasing or surrendering annuity is one of singular control. Thus,\nif at the point (w, A), it is optimal to purchase annuity income instantaneously, then the\nindividual moves instantly from (w, A) to (w \u2212 \u0101\u2206A, A + \u2206A), for some \u2206A > 0. The\noptimality of this decision implies that\n\u03c8(w, A) = \u03c8(w \u2212 \u0101\u2206A, A + \u2206A),\n\n(3.3)\n\n\u0101\u03c8w (w, A) = \u03c8A (w, A).\n\n(3.4)\n\nwhich in turn yields\n\nSimilarly, if it is optimal to surrender annuity income at the point (w, A), the following\nequation holds:\n\u03c8(w, A) = \u03c8(w + (1 \u2212 p)\u0101\u2206A, A \u2212 \u2206A),\n(3.5)\nwhich implies\n(1 \u2212 p)\u0101\u03c8w (w, A) = \u03c8A (w, A).\n\n(3.6)\n\nNotice that the surrender value is a portion of the value of annuity determined by the proportional surrender charge p.\nIn general, such purchasing or surrendering policies are suboptimal; therefore, (3.4) and\n\n6\n\n\f(3.6) hold as inequalities and become\n\u0101\u03c8w (w, A) \u2264 \u03c8A (w, A),\n\n(3.7)\n\n(1 \u2212 p)\u0101\u03c8w (w, A) \u2265 \u03c8A (w, A).\n\n(3.8)\n\nand\n\nBecause the individual will either buy additional annuity income, surrender existing annuity\nincome, or neither, we expect that the probability of lifetime ruin is a solution of the following\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) variational inequality\n(\n\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\nmax \u03bbS \u03c8 \u2212 (rw \u2212 c + A)\u03c8w \u2212 min (\u03bc \u2212 r)\u03c0\u03c8w + \u03c3 2 \u03c0 2 \u03c8ww ,\n\u03c0\n2\n)\n\u0101\u03c8w (w, A) \u2212 \u03c8A (w, A), \u03c8A (w, A) \u2212 (1 \u2212 p)\u0101\u03c8w (w, A)\n\n(3.9)\n\n= 0.\n\npc\n\u2212 \u0101A, in which A is the existing annuity income. At the\n\u2212 (1 \u2212 p)r\n(c \u2212 A)\u0101 \u2212 ws (A)\npoint (ws (A), A), suppose an individual borrows w\u0303(A) ,\nat the interest\n1 \u2212 r\u0101\n1\nrate r. She, then, has wealth ws (A) + w\u0303(A), which she spends to buy (ws (A) + w\u0303(A))\n\u0101\n1\nadditional life annuity income. Therefore, the total annuity income she has is A + (ws (A) +\n\u0101\nw\u0303(A)) = rw\u0303(A)+c, which is just enough to cover the interest for the debt and the consumption\nand thereby ensure that lifetime ruin is impossible. Note that ws (A) is the minimum required\nwealth to execute this strategy, so we call it the safe level for the case in which we allow wealth\nw to be negative. If asset and annuity income initially satisfy w \u2265 ws (A), then the individual\nwill immediately execute this strategy to guarantee that her probability of lifetime ruin is\nzero. It follows that\n\u03c8(w, A) = 0,\n(3.10)\nDefine ws (A) ,\n\n1\n\u0101\n\nfor w \u2265 ws (A).\nRecall that ruin occurs when w + (1 \u2212 p)\u0101A \u2264 0, from which it follows that\n\u03c8(w, A) = 1,\nfor w \u2264 w(A) , \u2212(1 \u2212 p)\u0101A.\nThe two boundaries ws (A) and w(A) meet at A =\n\n(3.11)\n\nc\n> 0 as in Figure 1.\n1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 p)r\u0101\nThus,\u001ait remains to solve the minimum probability of ruin\u001bin the region\nc\nD , (w, A) : w(A) \u2264 w \u2264 ws (A), 0 \u2264 A <\n.\n1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 p)r\u0101\n\n7\n\n\f3.2\n\nVerification Theorem\n\nThe discussion in Section 3.1 motivates the following verification theorem:\nTheorem 3.1 For any \u03c0 \u2208 R, define the functional operator L\u03c0 through its action on a test\nfunction f by\n1\nL\u03c0 f = [rw + (\u03bc \u2212 r)\u03c0 \u2212 c + A]fw + \u03c3 2 \u03c0 2 fww \u2212 \u03bbS f,\n(3.12)\n2\nLet v = v(w, A) be a non-increasing, non-negative, convex function of w that is twicedifferentiable with respect to w, except possibly at w = ws (A) where we assume that it has\nright- and left-derivatives, and that is differentiable with respect to A.

In other words, the individual does not buy any additional annuity\n9\n\n\fincome until her wealth reaches the safe level ws (A), which is consistent with the results\nof Milevsky et al. [2006]. Additionally, the individual never surrenders her annuity income.\nIntuitively, this makes sense because we count the annuity income's wealth equivalence in the\nruin level w(A) and thereby allow the individual to borrow against future annuity income\nwithout actually forcing her to surrender the annuity.\nUnder this hypothesis, the first inequality in the HJB variational inequality (3.9) holds\nwith equality in the region D\\{w = ws (A) or w = w(A)}, and the minimum probability of\nruin \u03c8 is the solution to the following boundary-value problem (BVP)\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n1 2 2\n\u03bb \u03c8 = (rw \u2212 c + A)\u03c8w + min (\u03bc \u2212 r)\u03c0\u03c8w + \u03c3 \u03c0 \u03c8ww ,\n\u03c0\n2\nS\n\n(3.23)\n\nwith the boundary conditions\n\u03c8(w(A), A) = 1,\n\n(3.24)\n\n\u03c8(ws (A), A) = 0.\n\n(3.25)\n\nand\n\nAfter solving this BVP, we will show that its solution satisfies the conditions of the Verification\nTheorem 3.1 to verify our hypothesis.\nTo solve the BVP, we transform the nonlinear boundary value problem above into a linear\nfree-boundary problem (FBP) via the Legendre transform. Assume \u03c8(w, A) is convex with\nrespect to w, which we verify later; therefore, we can define the concave dual \u03c8\u0302 of \u03c8 by\n\u03c8\u0302(y, A) = min [\u03c8(w, A) + wy].\n\n(3.26)\n\nw\u2265w(A)\n\nThe critical value w\u2217 (A) solves the equation \u03c8w (w, A) + y = 0; thus, w\u2217 = I(\u2212y, A), in which\nI is the inverse of \u03c8w with respect to w.

Since \u03c8\u0302 is concave\nfrom Propostion 3.2, we can define its convex dual via the Legendre transform for w \u2265 w(A)\nas\n\u03a8(w, A) = max[\u03c8\u0302(y, A) \u2212 wy].\n(3.57)\ny\u22650\n\nGiven A, the critical value y \u2217 solves the equation \u03c8\u0302y (y, A) \u2212 w = 0. Thus y \u2217 (A) = I(w, A),\nin which I is the inverse of \u03c8\u0302y . In this case, we also have expressions similar to those in\n(3.27)-(3.30).\nGiven \u03c8\u0302, we proceed to find the boundary-value problem that \u03a8 solves. In the partial\ndifferential equation for \u03c8\u0302 in (3.31), let y = I(w, A) = \u2212\u03a8w (w, A) to obtain\n\u03bbS \u03a8(w, A) = (rw \u2212 c)\u03a8w (w, A) \u2212 m\n\n\u03a82w (w, A)\n.\n\u03a8ww (w, A)\n\n(3.58)\n\nNotice that we can rewrite (3.58) as\nmin L\u03c0 \u03a8 = 0,\n\u03c0\n\n14\n\n(3.59)\n\n\fwith the minimizing strategy \u03c0 \u2217 given in feedback form by\n\u03c0 \u2217 (w, A) = \u2212\n\n\u03bc \u2212 r \u03a8w (w, A)\n.\n\u03c3 2 \u03a8ww (w, A)\n\n(3.60)\n\nTherefore, \u03a8 satisfies Condition 1 in Verification Theorem 3.1.\nNext, consider the boundary conditions for (3.31). First, the boundary conditions at\nys (A), namely \u03c8\u0302(ys (A), A) = ws (A)ys (A) and \u03c8\u0302y (ys (A), A) = ws (A), imply that the corresponding dual value of w is ws (A) and that\n\u03a8(ws (A), A) = 0.\n\n(3.61)\n\nSimilarly, the boundary conditions at y(A), namely \u03c8\u0302(y(A), A) = 1+w(A)y(A) and \u03c8\u0302y (y(A), A) =\nw(A), imply that the corresponding dual value of w is w(A) and that\n\u03a8(w(A), A) = 1.\n\n(3.62)\n\nFinally, Propostion 3.2 implies that\n\u0101\u03a8w (w, A) \u2212 \u03a8A (w, A) \u2264 0,\n\n(3.63)\n\n(1 \u2212 p)\u0101\u03a8w (w, A) \u2212 \u03a8A (w, A) \u2265 0.\n\n(3.64)\n\nand\n\nTherefore, \u03a8(w, A) satisfies Conditions 2 and 3 in Theorem 3.1.\nFrom \u03a8w (w, A) = \u2212y \u2217 (A) and the fact that y \u2265 ys (A) > 0, \u03a8(w, A) is decreasing with\nrespect to w, and consequently 0 \u2264 \u03a8(w, A) \u2264 1 for (w, A) \u2208 D due to (3.61) and (3.62).\nThus, \u03a8 is the minimum probability of ruin by Corollary 3.1, and we state this formally in\nthe next theorem.\nTheorem 3.2 The\n( minimum probability of ruin \u03c8(w, A) for (w, A) \u2208\n) D, in which D is\nc\ndefined by D = (w, A) : w(A) \u2264 w \u2264 ws (A), 0 \u2264 A <\nequals \u03a8(w, A) in\nr\n1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 p) r+\u03bb\nO\n(3.57).

We use the following values of the parameters for our calculation:\n\u2022 \u03bbS = \u03bbO = 0.04; the hazard rate is such that the expected future lifetime is 25 years.\n\u2022 r = 0.02; the riskless rate of return is 2% over inflation.\n\u2022 \u03bc = 0.06; the drift of the risky asset is 6% over inflation.\n\u2022 \u03c3 = 0.20; the volatility of the risky asset is 20%.\n\u2022 c = 1; the individual consumes one unit of wealth per year.\nWe focus on how the surrender penalty affects the probability of ruin and the optimal\ninvestment strategy.\nFigures 2-5 show the ruin probability \u03c8(w, A) and the associated optimal investment\n\u2217\n\u03c0 (w, A) in the risky asset with the parameters described above, as well as with values for A\nand p as indicated in the figures. Each curve gives values from w = w(A) to w = ws (A), in\nwhich w(A) and ws (A) vary with respect to A and p. This is the reason why each curve lies\nin a distinct domain. From the figures, we can see that the proved properties are verified in\nthese examples: the probability of ruin is decreasing and convex with respect to w. We also\nobserve that investment in the risky asset increases as wealth increases for each case.\n\n4\n\nBORROWING RESTRICTION\n\nIn this section, we consider the case in which the individual is forced to keep her wealth nonnegative by surrendering the life annuity when needed. With this restriction, the situation is\ndifferent from the one we studied in the previous section because in this section, the individual\ncannot borrow against future life annuity income. It is reasonable to apply this restriction\nbecause if the individual were to die, then the annuity income ceases. Therefore, if the\nindividual were to borrow against future annuity income and die, there might be insufficient\nassets available to pay the debt.\nTherefore, ruin occurs when both an individual's annuity income A and wealth w are 0\nsince she has no more annuity income to surrender to raise her wealth. It follows that \u03c40 in\nthis case reduces to the hitting time of (w, A) = (0, 0) because on the line w = \u2212(1 \u2212 p)\u0101A,\n(0, 0) is the only point at which wealth w is non-negative. Notice that the probability of\nlifetime ruin is not 1 when wealth reaches 0 if an individual still has existing annuity income,\nwhich differs from the case of irreversible annuities.\n\n16\n\n\f4.1\n\nHJB Variational Inequality and Verification Theorem\n\nAs the preceding case without a borrowing restriction, we have the same HJB variational\ninequality because the individual still has only three options to minimize the probability of\nruin: purchasing additional annuity income, surrendering existing annuity income, and doing\nneither. Suboptimality of each strategy, in general, is represented by an inequality, while\nthe optimality of one's executed strategy at all time requires that at least one of the three\ninequalities holds as an equality.\nWe need only consider when A < c; otherwise the individual already has enough annuity\nincome to cover her consumption and lifetime ruin is impossible. In this case, the safe level\nis given by ws (A) , (c \u2212 A)\u0101. When the individual's wealth reaches the safe level, she is able\nto purchase (c \u2212 A) of additional annuity income and, thereby, ensure that lifetime ruin is\nimpossible. Therefore, we have the condition\n\u03c8(ws (A), A) = 0.\n\n(4.1)\n\nNotice that, for a given existing annuity income A, more wealth is needed to reach the safe\nlevel if borrowing against the annuity is not allowed; that is, ws (A) in this section is greater\nthan ws (A) in the previous section.\nWhen the individual's wealth reaches 0, she is forced to surrender her life annuity to\nkeep her wealth non-negative. In this case, an annuitization strategy {At } is admissible\nif the associated wealth process Wt \u2265 0. almost surely, for all t \u2265 0. Inspired by the\noptimal annuitization strategy obtained in Theorem 3.2 for the case in which borrowing\nis not restricted, we hypothesize that the individual will only surrender enough annuity\nincome to keep wealth non-negative. This means that on the boundary w = 0, she executes\ninstantaneous control, so we expect the following Neumann condition:\n(1 \u2212 p)\u0101\u03c8w (0, A) = \u03c8A (0, A).\n\n(4.2)\n\nMoreover, if both her wealth and annuity income are 0, ruin occurs; that is,\n\u03c8(0, 0) = 1.\n\n(4.3)\n\nTherefore, we need to solve for \u03c8(w, A) in the region D , {(w, A) : 0 \u2264 w \u2264 ws (A), 0 \u2264\nA < c}. Notice that the safe level ws (A) = (c \u2212 A)\u0101 is different from the previous case. With\nD thus redefined, we obtain the same verification theorem and corollary as Theorem 3.1 and\nCorollary 3.1, respectively. Please refer to the previous section for details.\n\n4.2\n\nSolving for \u03c8 via Duality Arguments\n\nThrough the course of our study, we determined that the optimal annuitization strategy for\nthe individual to minimize her probability of lifetime ruin depends on the value of p. We\n\n17\n\n\fwill show that when the penalty for surrendering is greater than p\u2217 , a critical value to be\ndetermined later, the individual will not purchase any annuity until her wealth reaches the\nsafe level ws (A), at which point she buys annuity income to cover the shortfall c \u2212 A. On\nthe other hand, if the penalty is low enough, namely p < p\u2217 , the individual has incentive to\nannuitize partially; that is, the individual purchases additional annuity to cover part of the\nshortfall c \u2212 A when her wealth is strictly below the safe level. In this case, the individual will\nkeep some wealth to invest in the risky financial market and spend the surplus to purchase\nannuity income. We solve for the minimum probability of lifetime ruin \u03c8 for the first case\np \u2265 p\u2217 in Section 4.2.1 and for the second case p < p\u2217 in Section 4.2.2.

However, it is not clear how the optimal investment\nstrategy and the minimum probability of ruin vary with p. We investigate this in the next\nproposition.\nProposition 4.3 \u03c0 \u2217 (w, A) given in (4.39) is independent of the surrender charge p, and the\nprobability of ruin \u03c8(w, A) increases with respect to p.\nProof: Fix w and A.

Therefore, the optimal\nc\ninvestment strategy \u03c0 \u2217 (w, A) does not depend on p.\nNext, we show that \u2202\u03c8(w, A)/\u2202p > 0. To this end, recall from (4.38) that\n\u03c8(w, A) = \u03c8\u0302(y, A) \u2212 wy\n\u0013\ni \u0012c \u2212 A\nx he\nB1\nB2\ne\n=\nD1 (A)z + D2 (A)z\n+\n\u2212 w y,\ny0 (0)\nr\n\n23\n\n(4.47)\n\n\fin which y is given by (4.40).

Thus, the\nprobability of ruin \u03c8(w, A) increases as p increases.\n\u0003\n\u0012\n\nRemark 4.1 Proposition 4.3 indicates that, when borrowing is restricted and p \u2265 p\u2217 , an\nindividual follows exactly the same investment and annuitization strategies regardless of the\nvalue of p \u2265 p\u2217 . The individual makes her decision based on her wealth and existing annuity\nincome only. It is not surprising that for given values of w and A, the probability of ruin is\nsmaller for a smaller p because with a smaller surrender charge p, one receives more wealth\nwhen surrendering a given amount of annuity income.\nIn this section, we determined the optimal annuitization and investment strategies and\nthe corresponding minimum probability of ruin under the condition p \u2265 p\u2217 . The latter is\nequivalent to the condition K \u2265 0, which plays a critical role in the proof of Proposition 4.2. If\nK were negative, then inequality (4.33) would not hold for y just above ys (A). Consequently,\n\u03a8(w, A) would not satisfy Condition 2 in the Verification Theorem 3.1. From this, we infer\nthat buying additional annuity income before reaching the safe level w = ws (A) might be\noptimal when p < p\u2217 . With this in mind, we proceed to the next section.\n4.2.2\n\np < p\u2217\n\nIn this section, we consider the case for which p < p\u2217 . Define D1 , {(w, A) : 0 \u2264 w \u2264\nwb (A), 0 \u2264 A < c} with wb (A) \u2208 [0, ws (A)] to be specified later. Also, define D2 , {(w, A) :\nwb (A) < w \u2264 ws (A), 0 \u2264 A < c}, and note that D = D1 \u222a D2 . As in the case for which p \u2265 p\u2217\nin Section 4.2.1, we only need to determine the minimum probability \u03c8(w, A) for (w, A) \u2208 D.\nWe hypothesize that the following annuitization strategy is optimal: If (w, A) \u2208 D1 \\{w =\n0 or w = wb (A)}, the individual neither purchases or surrenders any life annuity income. If\n(w, A) \u2208 D2 , the individual purchases just enough annuity income to reach the region D1 .\nThat is to say, if she starts with (w, A) \u2208 D2 , the optimal strategy is to purchase \u2206A of\nannuity income such that w \u2212 \u2206A/(r + \u03bbO ) = wb (A + \u2206A). Thereafter, whenever wealth\nreaches the barrier wb (A), she keeps her portfolio of wealth and annuity income (w, A) in the\nregion D1 by instantaneously purchasing enough annuity income. On the other hand, when\nwealth reaches 0, the individual instantaneously surrenders enough annuity income to keep\nher wealth non-negative as we hypothesized in Section 4.2.1.\n\n24\n\n\fRuin occurs only when (w, A) = (0, 0), at which point one has no existing annuity income\nto surrender to keep wealth non-negative. Under the hypothesis for the optimal annuitization strategy, we anticipate that the associated minimum probability of ruin \u03c8 satisfies the\nfollowing boundary-value problem. After we solve this BVP, we will verify our hypothesis\nvia Verification Theorem 3.1.\n1. For (w, A) \u2208 D1 , \u03c8(w, A) solves the following BVP:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 2 2\n\u03bb \u03c8 = (rw \u2212 c + A)\u03c8w + min (\u03bc \u2212 r)\u03c0\u03c8w + \u03c3 \u03c0 \u03c8ww ,\n\u03c0\n2\nS\n\n(4.49)\n\nwith boundary conditions\n\u0101\u03c8w (wb (A), A) = \u03c8A (wb (A), A),\n\n(4.50)\n\n(1 \u2212 p)\u0101\u03c8w (0, A) = \u03c8A (0, A),\n\n(4.51)\n\n\u03c8(0, 0) = 1.\n\n(4.52)\n\nand\n\n2. For (w, A) \u2208 D2 , we have\n\u0012\n\u03c8(w, A) = \u03c8 w \u2212\n\n\u0013\n\u2206A\n, A + \u2206A ,\nr + \u03bbO\n\n(4.53)\n\nin which w \u2212\u2206A/(r +\u03bbO ) = wb (A+\u2206A). Notice that (w \u2212\u2206A/(r +\u03bbO ), A+\u2206A) \u2208 D1 ,\nand thus \u03c8(w \u2212 \u2206A/(r + \u03bbO ), A + \u2206A) is determined by the BVP (4.49)-(4.52).\n3. To solve for \u03c8 in the entire region D, as well as to determine the purchase boundary\nwb (A), we also rely on a smooth fit condition across the boundary wb (A), namely,\n\u0101\u03c8ww (wb (A), A) = \u03c8wA (wb (A), A).\n\n(4.54)\n\nWe first consider \u03c8(w, A) in the region D1 by solving the related BVP (4.49)-(4.52).\nHypothesize that \u03c8 is convex with respect to w, and define its concave dual via the Legendre\ntransform by\n\u03c8\u0302(y, A) = min [\u03c8(w, A) + wy] .\n(4.55)\nw\u22650\n\nAs before, rewrite (4.49) as\n\u2212 \u03bbS \u03c8\u0302 \u2212 (r \u2212 \u03bbS )y \u03c8\u0302y + my 2 \u03c8\u0302yy + y(c \u2212 A) = 0.\n\n(4.56)\n\nIts general solution is\n\u03c8\u0302(y, A) = D1 (A)y B1 + D2 (A)y B2 +\n25\n\nc\u2212A\ny,\nr\n\n(4.57)\n\n\fin which B1 > 1 and B2 < 0 are defined in (3.33).

Thus, we conclude that Condition 2 holds with equality for\n(w, A) \u2208 D2 . Finally, because 0 < p < p\u2217 \u2264 1, \u03a8w \u2264 0, and \u03a8A \u2264 0, it follows that Condition\n3 also holds on D2 .\n\u0003\nTherefore, \u03a8(w, A) is the minimum probability of ruin by the Verification Theorem 3.1,\nand we present the following theorem that summarizes the work of this section.\nTheorem 4.2 When p < p\u2217 and the borrowing restriction is enforced, the minimum probability of ruin for (w, A) \u2208 D = D1 \u222a D2 , with D1 = {(w, A) : 0 \u2264 w \u2264 wb (A), 0 \u2264 A < c}\nand D2 = {(w, A) : wb (A) < w < ws (A), 0 \u2264 A < c}, is given by \u03a8(w, A) defined above. The\nassociated optimal strategy is:\n1. to purchase additional annuity income so that wealth and annuity income lie on the\nboundary w = b * (c \u2212 A) of the region D1 when (w, A) \u2208 D2 ;\n2. to purchase additional annuity income instantaneously to keep (w, A) in the region D1\nwhen w = wb (A);\n3. to surrender exisiting annuity income instantaneously to keep w non-negative when\nneeded;\n4. to invest in the risky asset with amount\n\u03c0 \u2217 (w, A) = \u2212\n\n\u03bc \u2212 r \u03a8w (w, A)\n,\n\u03c3 2 \u03a8ww (w, A)\n\nwhen (w, A) \u2208 D1 .\n\n31\n\n\f4.3\n\nNumerical Examples\n\nIn this section, we present numerical examples to demonstrate the results of Section 4.2.1\nand 4.2.2. The basic scenario is the same as in Section 3.5, and we focus on the role of the\nsurrender penalty p.\n4.3.1\n\np \u2265 p\u2217\n\nFigures 6-9 show the ruin probabilities and associated optimal investment strategies when\np \u2265 p\u2217 . We fix all the parameters except for annuity income A and surrender penalty p. Note\nthat the smallest p value of the selected is 0.258, which is the value of p\u2217 for the scenario we\nchose. The boundary w = 0 and ws does not depend on p. Therefore, for each figure, all four\ncurves have the same domain. By showing the ruin probabilities and investment strategies\nfor different A and p, we see some common patterns as well as the effect of p. Within each\nfigure, the probabilities of ruin are decreasing and convex. On the surrender boundary w = 0,\nthe curves of the ruin probabilities begin with different values, not necessarily 0. This occurs\nbecause if the individual has some annuity income, she surrenders some of it to avoid ruin\nwhen reaching that boundary. We also observe that bigger p results in higher probability of\nruin. This is consistent with the financial intuition that an individual receives less wealth\nfrom surrendering annuity income when the penalty p is bigger, as we also show in Proposition\n4.3.\nIf A is not 0, reversibility makes difference in the ruin probability on the boundary w = 0,\nand consequently on the whole ruin probability curve. Reversibility of the annuity offers an\nextra chance to avoid bankrupcty. This is demonstrated by the difference of ruin probabilities\nbetween p = 0.258 and p = 1 for given values of (w, A). Note that at w = 0, the difference\nincreases dramatically as A increases. When A = 0, both ruin probabilities are 1. On the\nother hand, when A = 0.75, the individual with the reversible annuity (p = 0.258) has\nonly about a 25% chance to ruin when her wealth is 0 if she follows the optimal strategy.\nBy contrast, if the annuity is irreversible (p = 1), she ruins immediately when wealth is 0\nbecause the annuity is effectively worthless. This gap in the ruin probabilities shrinks as\nwealth w increases, and the ruin probabilities associated with different p's converge to 0 at\nw = ws (A), the safe level.\nThe interesting phenomenon that the investment in the risky asset does not depend on\np is demonstrated in all figures, as we also show in Proposition 4.3. This indicates that the\nindividual invests in the risky asset as if the annuity is irreversible when p \u2265 p\u2217 . That is, we\nsee a type of separation result: optimal investment in the risky asset is independent of the\noptimal annuitization strategy when p \u2265 p\u2217 .\n4.3.2\n\np < p\u2217\n\nFigures 10-13 show the ruin probabilities and associated optimal investment strategies when\np < p\u2217 . Recall from Section 4.2.2 that it is optimal to purchase immediate life annuities\n32\n\n\fbefore wealth reaches the safe level. Note that the largest value of p we can choose is 0.258.\nIt is natural to believe that one's behavior changes smoothly as penalty p changes. This\nbelief is confirmed in these figures. By observing the curves associated with p = 0.258 in\nFigures 6-9 and in Figures 10-13, we conclude that the optimal investment strategies and ruin\nprobabilities from the two different sets of equations are the same. (We can also demonstrate\nthis fact algebraically, but in the interest of space, we omit that computation.)\nWe see that the ruin probabilities in Figures 10-13 are all decreasing and convex. The\nwealth domain for a given function in these figures is [0, b * (c \u2212 A)], and note that b decreases\nas p decreases because for a smaller surrender charge, the individual has more incentive to\nannuitize at a lower wealth level. It remains true that, with all else equal, a smaller surrender\ncharge p results in a smaller probability of ruin. Also, note that investment in risky asset\nincreases as wealth increases, as in the case for which p \u2265 p\u2217 . However, different from what\nwe see for p \u2265 p\u2217 case, the investment strategy is no longer independent of p. More cash\nis invested in the risky asset if one can get a larger portion of her annuity value back by\nsurrendering.\nFigure 14 demonstrates the relation between b and the proportional surrender penalty p.\n1\n. We see that b increases monotonically\nThe sign \u2217 in the figure indicates the b value of\nr + \u03bbO\n1\nand continuously from 0 to\nas p increases from 0 to p\u2217 , as we expect.\nr + \u03bbO\n\n5\n\nConclusion\n\nThe annuity puzzle has been widely noted both in practice and in theoretical work; see\nMilevsky and Young [2007] and Milevsky et al. [2006] and the references therein. In this\npaper, we considered a financial innovation that might encourage more retirees to purchase\nimmediate life annuities, namely the option to surrender one's annuity for cash. We explained the relation between the irreversibility of annuitization and the retirees' reluctance\nto purchase. We investigated how reversibility would affect the decision of a retiree seeking to\nminimize her lifetime probability of ruin. We analyzed the optimal investment and annuitization strategies for such a retiree when borrowing against the surrender value of the annuity\nis prohibited. We found that the individuals annuity purchasing strategy depends on the\nsize of the proportional surrender charge. When the charge is large enough, the individual\nwill not buy a life annuity unless she can cover all her consumption, the so-called safe level.\nWhen the charge is small enough, the individual will buy a life annuity at a wealth lower\nthan this safe level. In both cases, the individual only surrenders annuity income in order to\nkeep her wealth non-negative.\nThese results confirm the point of view in Gardner and Wadsworth [2004] that the lack\nof flexibility discourages retirees from purchasing immediate life annuities. In our model, if\nannuities are irreversible, then retirees will buy annuities only when their wealth reaches the\nsafe level. Moreover, we showed that if annuities are reversible, then a retiree will partially\n\n33\n\n\fannuitize if the surrender charge is low enough. In numerical examples, we noticed that\nthe threshold value of surrender charge for an individual to consider partial annuitization\nmight be too low for annuity providers. This perhaps explains why reversible immediate life\nannuities are not offered in the annuity market.\nThe model in this paper offers a mathematical framework to understand the annuity\npuzzle. Even though we assumed constant hazard rates and interest rate in our analysis,\nwe believe that the main qualitative insight will be true in general and will be useful to\ndevelop better structured annuity products for retirees. Our analysis also implies that a well\ndeveloped secondary market of annuities would benefit both potential annuity buyers and\nproviders.\n\n6\n\nAppendix\n\nIn this appendix, we prove that the \u03c8\u0302 given in Proposition 4.4 is concave thereby completing\nthe proof of Proposition 4.5.\nTake the second derivative of (4.57) with respect to y to get\n\u03c8\u0302yy (y, A) = D1 (A)B1 (B1 \u2212 1)y B1 \u22122 + D2 (A)B2 (B2 \u2212 1)y B2 \u22122 .\n\n(6.1)\n\nWe want to show that \u03c8\u0302yy (y, A) \u2264 0 for yb (A) \u2264 y \u2264 y0 (A).
