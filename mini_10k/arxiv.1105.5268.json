For systems that exhibit bistability of two uniform states, a front\nconnecting these two states will normally drift in one direction, depending on which of the two states is preferred.\nAt a particular parameter value, known as the Maxwell\npoint, there is no preference between the two states and a\nstationary front exists. However, in systems where there\nis an underlying structure, on a scale that is typically\nsmall compared with the lengthscale of the front, a front\ncan become locked to this structure. This mechanism\nallows a stationary front to exist over a range of parameter values around the Maxwell point, known as the pinning region. Placing two fronts back-to-back creates a\nlocalized state, and the bifurcation diagram plotting the\nlength of this localized solution against the control parameter has a snaking structure, involving a sequence of\nsaddle-node bifurcations in near-perfect alignment. Since\nthe spatial structure of such a localized state departs from\nand then returns to, a uniform state, the phenomenon has\nbecome known as \"homoclinic snaking\". See [1, 2] for a\nreview of the subject and some open questions.\nThere are two distinct scenarios in which homoclinic\nsnaking appears. In the first of these, the underlying\nstructure is provided by pattern formation. A physical\nsystem, for example convection in fluids [3, 4], a vibrated\ngranular material, buckling of a solid cylinder [5], optical\nsystems [6] or gas discharge experiments [7, 8], has an\ninstability leading to the formation of a regular periodic\npattern as a parameter is varied. If this bifurcation is\nsubcritical, there is bistability between the uniform and\nthe patterned states. Near the onset of pattern formation, a subcritical Ginzburg-Landau equation can be derived [3, 9, 10], which has front-like solutions connecting\nthe two states. However, this equation does not capture\nthe locking mechanism. The localised states have been\nfound numerically in many studies [11\u201313] that use the\nSwift-Hohenberg equation as a simple model for pattern\nformation.\nA second situation in which locked fronts appear is in\ndiscretized forms of partial differential equations, where\nthere is a locking effect to the imposed lattice. Examples\ninclude stationary solutions of the discrete bistable non-\n\nlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation [14\u201316], which leads to a subcritical Allen-Cahn equation [17], optical cavity solitons\n[18, 19], and discrete systems with a weakly broken pitchfork bifurcation [20]. This situation also arises whenever\na bistable system is solved numerically on a spatial grid.\nAn interesting and challenging question is to determine\nthe width in parameter space of the region in which stationary localized solutions exist. Numerical simulations\nindicate that this pinning region becomes very small as\nthe separation of the two length-scales increases [10, 13].\nIn fact the region is exponentially small, or beyond all\norders. This is related to the fact that a conventional\nmultiple-scales asymptotic method cannot describe the\nlocking effect, since it regards to the two lengthscales\nas independent, while in fact the locking mechanism involves an explicit interaction between the short and long\nlengthscale. The necessary exponential asymptotics calculations, involving truncating a divergent asymptotic series at an optimal point and obtaining an equation for\nthe exponentially small remainder term, have recently\nbeen carried out for the Swift-Hohenberg equation with\nquadratic-cubic nonlinearities [21, 22] and cubic-quintic\nnonlinearities [23]. However, these calculations are extremely cumbersome and include an undetermined constant that must either be obtained numerically either by\nfitting to numerical results [21] or by approximately solving a complicated recurrence relation [23].\nIn this paper we use variational methods to obtain scaling laws for the structure of the snaking region, building\non the work in a previous short paper that studied the\ncubic-quintic Swift-Hohenberg equation [24]. Of course,\nnot all systems that exhibit homoclinic snaking have a\nvariational structure, but most of those previously studied do. The variational method is dependent on good initial ansatz, but this is known in the cases studied here.\nFor pattern forming problems near onset, it is known\nthat the solution can be described by a slowly varying\nenvelope function multiplied by a sinusoidal wave. Furthermore, the form of the envelope function is known\nfrom the standard asymptotic analysis, and can be obtained to higher order if required. Thus there is no guesswork involved in the method. Calculating the integrals\nin the Lagrangian automatically leads to exponentially\nsmall terms, and from these we can obtain the phase of\nthe locked states that is inaccessible to the usual asymp-\n\n\f2\nform an intertwined snaking pattern near the Maxwell\npoint at r \u2248 \u22120.151. On one of these branches, the maximum of the envelope function coincides with a minimum\nof the periodic pattern, and on the other it coincides with\n10\n\n9\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\nN\n\ntotic expansion. Note that variational methods have been\nused before to study localized states on lattices [14, 15],\nbut not in the slowly-varying regime that is studied here.\nAlso in the continuous case, variational methods have\nbeen used [25], but not in the snaking regime.\nHere, we consider two equations, namely the quadraticcubic Swift\u2013Hohenberg equation and the discrete cubicquintic Schr\u00f6dinger equation, also known as the spatially\ndiscrete Allen\u2013Cahn equation, representing continuous\nand discrete systems, respectively. The first equation\nis discussed in Section II. The results are then compared with numerical results obtained by continuation in\nSection II C. The second equation is studied in Section\nIII. The scaling calculated analytically using the variational method is then compared with computational results, where good agreement is obtained. Conclusions are\nin Section IV.\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\nII. THE QUADRATIC-CUBIC\nSWIFT-HOHENBERG EQUATION\n\n0\n\u22120.2\n\nThe quadratic-cubic Swift-Hohenberg equation is given\nby\n\u2202t u = ru \u2212 1 + \u2202x2\n\n\u00012\n\nu + b2 u 2 \u2212 b3 u 3 .\n\n(1)\n\nThis equation represents a simple model for pattern\nforming systems that do not have a symmetry under sign reversal of the dependent variable u, and has\nbeen very widely used to illustrate homoclinic snaking\n[9, 11, 12, 22]. The Lagrangian for (1) is\n\u0013\nZ \u221e\u0012 2\nuxx\nu2\nb2 3 b3 4\n2\nL=\n\u2212 ux + (1 \u2212 r) \u2212 u + u dx.\n2\n2\n3\n4\n\u2212\u221e\n(2)\nIt can easily be shown that L decreases with time, so\nstable stationary states of (1) correspond to minima of\n(2). It will be assumed that b3 > 0; in this case u can\nbe rescaled to set b3 = 1. In (1), the bifurcation at\nr = 0 is subcritical (allowing localised patterns) if b2 >\np\n27b3 /38.\nFigure 1 shows the bifurcation diagram for (1) obtained\nby a numerical continuation method for b2 = 1.5, b3 = 1,\nwith periodic boundary conditions in a domain of length\nl = 82\u03c0.

Solutions along the former branch are shown in Figure 2. The first figure, for r = \u22120.01, shows a slow spatial\nmodulation that can be represented by an envelope in the\nform of a sech function (see Sec. II A). For r = \u22120.05 the\namplitude modulation occurs over a shorter lengthscale\nbut can still be represented by the sech function. The\nthird graph shows u(x) at the first saddle-node bifurcation, r = \u22120.146, and the final graph is at a saddle-node\nbifurcation higher up the graph where r = \u22120.158 and\nN = 5.15. At this stage the solution resembles two fronts\nconnecting the periodic solution to the state u = 0 (see\nSec. II B).\n\nA.\n\nAnalysis of solutions near r = 0\n\nThe analysis near r = 0 can be performed in a similar way to that in [24]. Motivated by the results from\nmultiple scale expansions [12, 25, 26], we take the ansatz\nu = A sech(Bx) cos(kx + \u03c6) + C sech2 (Bx),\nfrom which we obtain that the norm (3) is given by\n\n(4)\n\n\f3\n0.2\n0\n\u22120.2\n\n\u2212100\n\n\u221250\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n\u2212100\n\n\u221250\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n\u2212100\n\n\u221250\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n\u2212100\n\n\u221250\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n0.2\n0\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.4\n1\n0.5\n0\n\u22120.5\n\n1\n0.5\n0\n\u22120.5\n\nFIG. 2: Localized solutions on one branch of Fig. 1.

Furthermore, (6) shows that steady states (extrema of Lef f )\nexist if \u03c6 is a multiple of \u03c0 [26]. There are two distinct\nstates, \u03c6 = 0 and \u03c6 = \u03c0, both corresponding to even solutions but with the maximum of the envelope function\nsech(Bx) coinciding with a maximum or minimum of the\nwave cos(kx), as shown by the numerical continuation\nmethod in the previous section. Note that this result does\nnot depend on our choice of ansatz. For any slowly varying, even modulation function f (Bx), the integrals in the\nLagrangian involve powers of f (Bx) and its derivatives\nmultiplied by cos(kx) cos(\u03c6), yielding an exponentially\nsmall quantity multiplied by cos(\u03c6), and hence stationary\nstates with \u03c6 = 0, \u03c0. In the symmetric cubic-quintic case\n[24], only even powers appear in the integrals, leading\n\n(6)\n\nto integrals only involving cos(2kx) cos(2\u03c6), and hence\nstationary solutions with \u03c6 = 0, \u03c0/2, \u03c0, 3\u03c0/2.\nApplying the Euler-Lagrange formulation to the effective Lagrangian\n\n\u2202\nLef f = 0,\n\u2202\u03b1\n\n(7)\n\ngives us a system of nonlinear equations for \u03b1, with \u03b1 =\nA, B, C, k, \u03c6, that make (4) an approximate solution of\n(1).\nNeglecting the exponentially small terms in the effective Lagrangian (6), the Euler-Lagrange equations can be\n\n\f4\nsolved perturbatively about r = 0 to yield\n\nA =\nB =\nC =\nk =\n\ns\n\n\u221a\n8\n\u2212r + O((\u2212r)3/2 ),\n4b22 \u2212 3b3\n1\u221a\n\u2212r + O(\u2212r),\n2\n4b2\nr + O((\u2212r)3/2 ),\n\u2212 2\n4b2 \u2212 3b3\np\nr\n1 \u2212 B2 = 1 + .\n8\n\nB.\n\n(8)\n(9)\n(10)\n(11)\n\nIt is important to note that the presence of C 6= 0\nplays an important role in the calculations above, unlike the case of the cubic-quintic equation [24] where it\nwas possible to include only the first term in (4). Taking C = 0 would result in the leading order expression\nof A independent of b2 , which is incorrect. This occurs because when C = 0 the cubic term in the Lagrangian, which corresponds to the crucial symmetrybreaking quadratic term in (1), does not contribute to\nthe Lagrangian integral except through an exponentially\nsmall term. Note that C = b2 A2 /2, a result that is also\neasily be obtained at second order in the asymptotic analysis of the problem. A similar Lagrangian method was\nused by Wadee and Bassom [25], using more terms in\nthe ansatz (4) but with \u03c6 = 0. The results above for A\nand C are almost the same as those obtained using multiple scale expansions [12, 25]. A slight difference arises\nas we have for simplicity omitted a second-order term in\nsech2 (Bx) cos(2kx + 2\u03c6); including this term would give\nexact agreement between the Lagrangian method and the\nasymptotic analysis. According to (8) the transition from\na sub- to supercritical bifurcation occurs at b22 /b3 = 3/4,\nwhich is very close to the true value of 27/38 [22].\nThe equation (11) indicates a slight decrease in the\nwavenumber, corresponding to a slight increase in the\nwavelength of the patterns. As noted by Wadee and\nBassom [25], this is simply a consequence of the linear\ndispersion relation; (11) can be obtained directly from\nthe linear terms in (1) when r < 0. Hence it is not surprising that the same wavenumber correction was found\nin the cubic-quintic case [24].\nWhen neglecting the exponentially small terms, the\nphase-shift \u03c6 at this order is arbitrary, which also agrees\nwith the multiple scales result. However, taking into account the equation \u2202\u03c6 Lef f = 0, in which all the terms\nare exponentially small, \u03c6 has to be a multiple of \u03c0, as\nmentioned above.\nThe ansatz (4) is only appropriate for small values of\n|r|, away from the Maxwell point (see Figs. 1 and 2). In\nthe snaking region near the Maxwell point, the envelope\nof the localized states resembles two connected fronts.\nThe following section introduces a suitable ansatz for this\nregime.\n\nAnalysis of solutions near the Maxwell point\n\nFor values of b2 in the neighbourhood of\nr\n27\nb20 =\nb3 ,\n38\n\n(12)\n\nthe bifurcation is only slightly subcritical and the\nMaxwell point is within reach of weakly nonlinear analysis. In this case the quadratic-cubic Swift-Hohenberg\nequation (1) has a front solution, which is approximately\ngiven by [22]\n\u0010\n\u0011\ncos x \u2212 2\u221a1734 ln (1 + eaM x )\n\u221a\nu = AM\n,\n(13)\n1 + e\u2212aM x\nwith\nAM\nrM\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\n38 \u2212rM\n\u221a\n=\n, aM = \u2212rM ,\n734b3\n6859\n= \u2212\n(b2 \u2212 b20 )2 .\n17616b3\ns\n\n(14)\n(15)\n\nIn analytically estimating the width of the snaking region in the equation using variational approximations,\nwe will employ a front solution similar to (13). Considering this solution, one can note that the oscillation wave\nnumber k of the front changes in\n\u221a space. In the limits\nx \u2192 \u00b1\u221e, k \u2192 1 and (1 \u2212 aM (2 734)\u22121 ) \u2248 1. Therefore, we will fix k = 1 to simplify the analysis.\nIt turns out that as in the case of the sech solutions\nconsidered in the previous section, if only the leading\norder front solution (13) is used as the ansatz, the leading\nterms in the Lagrangian do not depend on b2 , giving\nqualitatively incorrect results. We therefore adopt an\nansatz of the form\nA cos(x + \u03c6)\nb2 A2\nu= \u221a\n.\n+\n1 + eB(|x|\u2212L) 2(1 + eB(|x|\u2212L))\n\n(16)\n\nThe second term here arises at second order in the weakly\nnonlinear expansion [25], included for a similar reason as\ndiscussed in the previous section. This term is responsible for the upward displacement of the periodic pattern\nthat is apparent in Fig. 2. To simplify the calculation we\nhave set the value of the coefficient of this term in advance\nrather than leaving it as a free parameter. The asymptotic analysis includes another second-order term, proportional to cos 2(x + \u03c6) [25], which is omitted partly in\nthe interests of simplicity and partly because it is smaller\nby a factor of 9 than the term we have included.\nEvaluation of the Lagrangian integral is considerably\nmore complicated than in the cubic-quintic case [24].\nThis is partly because of the two-term ansatz and partly\nbecause the dominant terms come from odd powers of\nthe square root function, requiring integrals that cannot simply be computed using residues. These integrals\ncan be evaluated in terms of multiplications of gamma\n\n\f5\nfunctions of a complex argument, which in turn can be\nexpanded using Stirling's formula when B is small, giving the anticipated exponentially small terms. There are\na large number of these exponentially small terms, and\nthe calculation is complicated by the fact that terms involving higher powers of u, which one might expect to\ngive a smaller contribution, in fact all give exponentially\nsmall terms of the same order.\nTo illustrate Rsome of the steps in the calculation, con\u221e\nsider the term \u2212\u221e u2 dx, which is the defined norm (3)\nand one of the terms in the Lagrangian density (2). Using\nthe ansatz, this can be written as\n\u0001\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e 2\nA 1 + b22 A2 /2 + eB(x\u2212L)\n2\nu dx =\n\u00012\n\u2212\u221e\n0\n1 + eB(x\u2212L)\n+\n\nafter using the double-angle formula and the fact that\nthe envelope function is even. The first term, that is independent of \u03c6, in the integral can be evaluated\ndirectly\n\u0001\nand gives the answer A2 L 1 + A2 b22 /2 \u2212 A4 b22 /(2B) +\nO(e\u2212BL ). The integral of the third term can be found\nby using contour integration, similarly to that used in\n[24]. Yet, we are not interested in the explicit expression\nof it, as it contributes to higher harmonic corrections in\n\u03c6. The second term is of our interest, giving a leading\n\u03c0\nexponentially small contribution of order O(e\u2212 B ). Unfortunately, the integral cannot be immediately evaluated\nby using the residue method as mentioned above. By using Mathematica, one will obtain that\n\n2b2 A3 cos(\u03c6) cos(x) A2 cos(2\u03c6) cos(2x)\n\u00013/2 + 1 + eB(\u2212L+x) dx,(17)\n1 + eB(x\u2212L)\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nie\u2212iL \u0393 3B+2i\nieiL \u0393 3B\u22122i\n\u0393 \u2212i+B\n\u0393 i+B\ncos(x) dx\n2B\nB\n2B\nB\n\u221a\n\u221a\n=\n\u2212\n\u00013/2\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n0\n1 + eB(x\u2212L)\n\"\n\u221a\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013#\ni+B 1\ni\u2212B 1 i\ni\neBL 2eBL 1 + e\u2212BL\n\u2212BL\n\u2212BL\n\u2212 2 F1 \u2212\n,\n\u2212 2 F1\n, , , \u2212e\n, , \u2212 , \u2212e\n+\nB\n1 + eBL\nB\n2 B\nB\n2 B\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nwhere \u0393 and 2 F1 are respectively the Gamma and the\nhypergeometric function.\nThe hypergeometric function can be written in a series\nform as\n\u221e\nX\n(a)n (b)n z n\nF\n(a,\nb,\nc,\nz)\n=\n,\n2 1\n(c)n n!\nn=0\n\nwhere (\u2022)n = \u2022(\u2022 + 1) . . .

(22)\n\nConsider first the terms that are not exponentially\nsmall, that is, the terms that do not involve the phase\n\u03c6. Bearing in mind the anticipated scaling from (14),\nA = O(r1/4 ), the dominant terms in the bracket multiplied by L are the first two terms, so Lef f only has a\nminimum over L if at leading order, b22 = 3b3 /4. This\nis very close to the asymptotic result (12), and would be\nexactly the same if we had included the cos 2(x + \u03c6) term\nmentioned above. We therefore set\np\n(23)\nb2 = 3b3 /4 + \u2206, |\u2206| \u226a 1,\n\nand expect that \u2206 and B are O(r1/2 ), in which case the\nleading terms in the Lagrangian are\nLlead\nef f =\n\np\nA2\n(32B 2 + 32 3b3 A2 \u2206 \u2212 45A4 b23 )\n128B\np\nLA2\n+\n(45A4 b23 /2 \u2212 48r \u2212 24 3b3 A2 \u2206).(24)\n96\n\nFinding and solving the Euler-Lagrange equations by differentiating with respect to L, A and B gives the values\n\u221a\n\u221a\n8 3\u2206\n10\u2206\n2\nA =\n, B= \u221a\n(25)\n3/2\n5 b3\n15b3\nand yields the Maxwell point\nrM = \u2212\n\n2\u22062\n= \u2212B 2 ,\n5b3\n\n(26)\n\nwhich is within 3% of the asymptotic value given in (15).\nNote that the length L is not determined by these equations. Substituting these values of A, B and rM into the\nleading terms of the Lagrangian we find that the minimum is\n\u221a\n4 30\u22062\nlead\nM in(Lef f ) =\n.\n(27)\n75b23\nThus, although the Maxwell point can be determined by\nthe condition that L is zero for both the zero state and the\n\n(21)\n\nperiodic state, the value of L is not zero for the localized\nstate, due to the presence of the fronts. In fact, L is\npositive and of the same order as r.\nConsidering now the exponentially small term involving \u03c6, it is clear from \u2202\u03c6 Lef f = 0 that there are two\ndistinct branches of stationary snaking solutions, with\n\u03c6 = 0 and \u03c6 = \u03c0, corresponding to the centre of the\nlocalised pattern being a local maximum or minimum\nrespectively. However, another possible way to satisfy\n\u2202\u03c6 Lef f = 0 is that the coefficient multiplying the cos \u03c6\nterm vanishes, i.e.\nK+ cos(L) + K\u2212 sin(L) = 0.\n\n(28)\n\nSubstituting the above values of A and B, and taking\nthe leading terms in K\u00b1 , solutions of this type occur for\nvalues of L given by\ntan L = K+ /K\u2212 ,\n\n(29)\n\nwhere K\u00b1 is given in (22), which to the leading order is\n\u221a \u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a \u0011\n8 4 30 \u03c0 \u0010\n\u00b1307 3 \u2212 210 10 .\nK\u00b1 =\n(30)\n7875 b3\n\nHence, for small B these states exist if L = \u22120.110219...+\nm\u03c0 for integer values of m. These solutions have been\nreferred to as \"bridges\" [27] or \"ladders\" [28] and were\nidentified in the exponential asymptotics of (1) by Yang\nand Akylas [26] and Chapman and Kozyreff [21]. The\nladder states (not shown in Fig. 1) have no reflection\nsymmetry and connect the two snaking branches, bifurcating from them near the saddle-node bifurcations.\nTo find the snaking range, we set sin(\u03c6) = 0 and r =\nrM + \u03b4r, and the Lagrangian simplifies to\n\u221a\n\u03b4rA2 L\n4 30\u22062\n\u2212\nLef f =\n75b23\n2\n\u03c0\n\n+e\u2212 B (K+ cos(L) + K\u2212 sin(L)) ,\n\n(31)\n\nwith K\u00b1 given in (30). This can be minimised over L\nto give the exponentially small value of \u03b4r for stationary\nsolutions,\n\u03c0\n\n\u03b4r =\n\n2e\u2212 B\n(K\u2212 cos(L) \u2212 K+ sin(L)) .\nA2\n\n(32)\n\n\f7\nwhere the phase shift L0 satisfies (29) and for convenience\nwe have set the constants to 1. Figure 3(a) shows a surface plot of Le for \u03b4r = 0. The solutions on the snaking\nbranches, with \u03c6 = 0, \u03c0, L \u2212 L0 = m\u03c0 are either maxima\nor minima, so are either stable or unstable with two positive eigenvalues. The ladder solutions at \u03c6 = \u03c0/2, 3\u03c0/2,\nL \u2212 L0 = \u03c0/2 + m\u03c0 are saddle points and are therefore\nalways unstable. The surface plot for \u03b4r = 0.4 is shown\nin Fig. 3(b). The symmetric snaking solutions remain at\n\u03c6 = 0, \u03c0 but are shifted in L, while the ladder states are\nshifted in \u03c6 but remain at the same values of L.\nC.\n\nNumerical results\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\nFIG. 3: Surface plots of the simplified Lagrangian (34), (a)\nwith \u03b4r = 0 and (b) with \u03b4r = 0.4.\n\nThe maximum value of \u03b4r (half the width of the snaking\nregion) is then, using the leading-order approximations\nfor b2 , A and B given above,\n\u03b4rm =\n\n\u221a\n2e\u2212\u03c0/B p\n4\n241249\u03c0b3 120.\n525\u2206\n\n(33)\n\nNote that the dependence of the snaking width on the\nsmall parameter \u2206 is very similar to that for the small\nparameter b3 in the cubic-quintic case [24]. The dependence in (33) is the same as that obtained by Kozyreff and\nChapman [22] using the methods of exponential asymptotics, although the comparison is not immediate since\nthey regard b2 as the control parameter rather than r.\nNote that the numerical coefficient was determined by\nfitting in [22].\nA useful feature of the Lagrangian method is that we\ncan examine the stability of steady states since we know\nthat stable equilibria are local minima of the Lagrangian.\nConsidering the exponentially small terms, with A and\nB fixed and r = rM + \u03b4r, the dependence of L on \u03b4r, L\nand \u03c6 can be represented by the function\nLe (\u03b4r, L, \u03c6) = \u2212\u03b4rL + cos \u03c6 cos(L \u2212 L0 ),\n\n(34)\n\nIn this section we compare the above results from\nthe variational method with numerical solutions of the\nquadratic-cubic Swift-Hohenberg equation (1). We have\nsolved the equation numerically for localized states, using a pseudo-arclength continuation method with periodic boundary conditions, implemented with a Fourier\nspectral discretization. Plotted in the top left panel of\nFig. 4 is the bifurcation diagram showing two branches\nof localized solutions for b2 = 1.3 and b3 = 1. In the\nsame panel, shown in dashed lines are our analytical results obtained from (7) using the sech ansatz, where one\ncan see that the variational calculation approximates the\nnumerics very well for relatively small |r|. As r decreases\nfurther and enters the snaking region, the approximation\ndeviates from the numerics. In the top right panel, we\nplot the profile of a localized solution at r = \u22120.06 and\nits approximation.\nConsidering Eqs. (8)\u2013(11) one can conclude that for\nlarger values of the parameter b2 , the parameter |r| can\nbe larger while keeping the amplitude A (8) small. This\nimplies that the sech ansatz can have a longer validity\nregion for large b2 . It is important to note that the ansatz\nmight be able to quantitatively capture the first snaking\nbifurcation for a larger value of b2 .\nIn panel (c) of the same figure, we plot the Lagrangian\n(2) corresponding to the bifurcation diagram (a) as a\nfunction of the length of the solution's plateau 2L, which\nis calculated numerically as\nR l/2\n8 \u2212l/2 u2 dx\n,\n2L \u2248\n(uM \u2212 um )2 + 2(uM + um )2\n\nwhere uM = max{u} and um = min {u}. The integration\nis a definite integration over the computational domain.\nPlotted in the same panel is our effective Lagrangian (31).\nThere is good agreement for the average numerical value\nof the Lagrangian and the qualitative nature of the oscillations, but the amplitude of the oscillations appears\nto be underestimated in the variational approximation.\nNote that the amplitude of the oscillations in L increases\nwith L since from (31) with \u03b4r \u221d cos(L), there are oscillations of the form L cos(L).\nFinally, in panel (d) we show the width of the snaking\nregion as a function of b2 numerically and analytically,\n\n\f8\n6\n\n1\n\n5\n0.5\n\nu\n\nN\n\n4\n3\n\n0\n\n2\n\u22120.5\n1\n0\n\u22120.08\n\n\u22120.06\n\n\u22120.04\n\n\u22120.02\n\n\u22121\n\u221250\n\n0\n\n0\n\nr\n\nx\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n0.1\n\n50\n\n0.12\n0\n\n10\n\n0.1\n\n0.06\n\n\u22125\n\n10\n\n0.06\n0.04\n\n0.04\n\nwidth\n\n0.08\n\nwidth\n\nLagrangian\n\n0.08\n\n\u221210\n\n10\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\nb\n\n2\n\n0.02\n0.02\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n2L\n(c)\n\n0\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\nb2\n(d)\n\nFIG. 4: (a) The bifurcation diagram obtained numerically and our approximation obtained from solving (7) with the ansatz (4)\nfor b2 = 1.3.

This confirms that the snaking states are in\ngeneral either stable, or unstable with two small positive\neigenvalues. One eigenvalue changes sign at the saddlenode bifurcation and another at the nearby bifurcation\nto the ladder states. The ladder states are found to be\nunstable with one positive eigenvalue, consistent with the\nfact that they are saddle points of the Lagrangian.\n\nIII.\n\nSNAKING IN DISCRETE SYSTEMS\n\nTo illustrate the wide-ranging applicability of the variational method in describing the snaking behaviour, we\nanalyse in this section an analogous problem in discrete\nsystems. This turns out to be remarkably similar to the\n\ncontinuous case. Consider the system of ordinary differential equations\ndun\n= C(un+1 \u2212 2un + un\u22121 ) + \u03bcun + 2u3n \u2212 u5n , (35)\ndt\nwith the condition that un \u2192 0 as n \u2192 \u00b1\u221e. We assume\nthat C > 0 and look for stationary solutions of (35).\nThis system has been considered in [14\u201317], and very\nsimilar systems have been studied in [19, 20]. The system (35) is interpreted as a discrete form of the nonlinear\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation in [15, 16], and a discrete subcritical Allen\u2013Cahn equation in [17]. These previous studies\nhave used numerical continuation to obtain bifurcation\ndiagrams that show a very similar snaking structure to\nthat seen in the continuous Swift-Hohenberg equation\n(1). Note however that (35) is not a discrete form of\nthe Swift-Hohenberg equation. Rather it is a discrete\nform of the subcritical Ginzburg\u2013Landau equation that\ndescribes the slowly varying envelope function for (1).\nThus the snaking behaviour seen in (35) results from a\n\n\f9\nlocking mechanism to the discrete lattice, with the lattice\npoints providing the analogue of the small-scale pattern\nin the Swift-Hohenberg equation. In view of this, computational investigation of the snaking in (35) is much\neasier than in (1), since there is no small-scale structure\nto resolve.\nThe grid-locking behaviour of fronts in (35) can be seen\nas an indication of numerical error in the finite-difference\napproximation of the bistable partial differential equation\n\u2202u\n\u22022u\n+ \u03bcu + 2u3 \u2212 u5 .\n=\n\u2202t\n\u2202X 2\n\n(36)\n\nWhen (36) is discretized with second-order finite differences with mesh spacing \u01eb, the result is (35) with\nC = \u01eb\u22122 . Front-like solutions to (36) are travelling waves,\nfor all values of \u03bc except exactly at the Maxwell point.\nThus the snaking branch of (35) indicates a range of values of \u03bc where the numerical approximation incorrectly\nfinds a stationary solution. It is therefore of interest to\ndetermine the width of this region for small values of \u01eb\n(large values of C). An alternative scaling, similar to that\nin Sec. II, is to set C = 1 and replace the 2 in (35) by a\nsmall parameter b2 ; however we will use the form (35) to\nfacilitate comparison with the previous work cited above.\nThe Lagrangian for (35) is\nL=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nC\n\u03bc\n1\n1\n(un+1 \u2212 un )2 \u2212 u2n \u2212 u4n + u6n . (37)\n2\n2\n2\n6\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\nNote that a variational method has been used in [14, 15]\nto study the case of small C, but here the focus will be\non large C. The uniform solutions of (35) are given by\nun = 0 and\np\n(38)\nu2n = 1 \u00b1 1 + \u03bc,\n\nso there is a saddle-node bifurcation at \u03bc = \u22121 and there\nis bi-stability of both the zero state and the larger nonzero solution in (38) for \u22121 < \u03bc < 0. By finding the\nLagrangian of this non-zero state it is straightforward to\nshow that the Maxwell point is at \u03bc = \u22123/4\np and so at\nthis point the stable non-zero state is un = 3/2.\nFor large C we expect the solution to (35) to be close\nto that of the continuous system (36). At the Maxwell\npoint there is an exact stationary front-like solution of\n(36), u(X), given by\nu2 =\n\n\u221a\nA2\n, where A2 = 3/2, \u03b1 = 3.\n\u03b1X\n1+e\n\n(39)\n\nIn the discretized system, un = u(\u01ebn), and we wish to\nconsider a localized state linking two fronts. The ansatz\nanalogous to that used in the continuous case (16) is then\nu2n\n\n2\n\n=\n\nA\n\n1 + e\u03b1\u01eb(|n\u2212\u03c6|\u2212L)\n\n.\n\n(40)\n\nHere, the length of the front (measured in terms of the\nnumber of mesh points) is 2L and \u03c6 is a phase variable,\n\nwhich is arbitrary at this stage but will be determined\nby exponentially small terms. If \u03c6 = 0 then uj = u\u2212j\nand the localized state is symmetrical and 'site-centred'.\nSimilarly, a 'bond-centred' symmetrical state, with the\nproperty uj = u1\u2212j , can be obtained by setting \u03c6 = 1/2.\nNote that it is not necessary to include higher order terms\nin (40) as in (16); this is because (35) only has nonlinear\nterms with odd powers and therefore is more analogous\nto the cubic-quintic Swift-Hohenberg equation analysed\nwith the Lagrangian approach in [24].\nP\u221e\nConsider now the sum n=\u2212\u221e u2n that appears in L.\nThis can be evaluated by writing the sum as an integral\nof a function multiplied by a sum of \u03b4 functions, and then\nwriting the sum of \u03b4 functions as a Fourier series:\n\u221e\nX\n\nu2n\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n=\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\nA2\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n=\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n1 + e\u03b1\u01eb(|n\u2212\u03c6|\u2212L)\nA2\n\n1 + e\u03b1\u01eb(|x\u2212\u03c6|\u2212L)\nA2\n1+\n\ne\u03b1\u01eb(|x\u2212\u03c6|\u2212L)\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03b4(x \u2212 n) dx\ne2ik\u03c0x dx.\n\nk=\u2212\u221e\n\nNote that x here is not the same as X in (36), rather it is a\ncontinuous form of the variable n. Of course the Fourier\nseries representation of the \u03b4 function is not uniformly\nconvergent, but the integral converges very rapidly \u2013 in\nfact exponentially. From the term k = 0 we obtain an\norder one contribution\nZ \u221e\nA2\ndx = 2LA2 + O(e\u2212\u03b1\u01ebL ). (41)\n\u03b1\u01eb(|x\u2212\u03c6|\u2212L)\n\u2212\u221e 1 + e\nThe terms with k = \u00b11 give a contribution\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nA2 (e2i\u03c0x + e\u22122i\u03c0x )\ndx\n1 + e\u03b1\u01eb(|x\u2212\u03c6|\u2212L)\n\n(42)\n\nwhich is exponentially small in \u01eb, and the terms arising\nfrom larger values of k are smaller by an exponentially\nsmall factor. Note that the integrals that are needed here,\nfor the discrete case, are essentially exactly the same integrals that were needed for the continuous case in Sec. II\nand [24].\nThe integral (42) can be found using contour integration. For the term in e2i\u03c0x the contour is closed in\nthe upper half plane and is dominated by the poles at\nx = \u03c6 \u00b1 L + i\u03c0/(\u03b1\u01eb). The sum of the residues at these\ntwo poles is\n\u2212 2i sin(2\u03c0L)e2i\u03c0\u03c6\n\nA2 \u22122\u03c02\ne \u03b1\u01eb .\n\u03b1\u01eb\n\n(43)\n\nThe value of (42) is found by multiplying this by 2i\u03c0 and\nadding the complex conjugate to account for the e\u22122i\u03c0x\nterm. Hence the required sum is\n\n\f10\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nu2n = 2LA2 + 8\u03c0 sin(2\u03c0L) cos(2\u03c0\u03c6)\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\n\u22124\u03c0 2\nA2 \u22122\u03c02\ne \u03b1\u01eb + O(e \u03b1\u01eb , e\u2212\u03b1\u01ebL ).\n\u03b1\u01eb\n\n(44)\n\nAs in the continuous snaking case, we suppose that the exponential terms responsible for the grid locking dominate\nthose from the interaction between the two fronts.

Note that for small \u01eb, the dominant exponentially\nsmall term comes from (46).\nThe remaining term required for the Lagrangian is\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\n(un+1 \u2212 un )2 =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nA2\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n1 + e\u03b1\u01eb(|n+1\u2212\u03c6|\u2212L)\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n1 + e\u03b1\u01eb(|n\u2212\u03c6|\u2212L)\n\n\u00132\n\n.\n\n(47)\n\nAs with the other terms, this can be written as an integral,\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nA2\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n1 + e\u03b1\u01eb(|x+1\u2212\u03c6|\u2212L)\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n1 + e\u03b1\u01eb(|x\u2212\u03c6|\u2212L)\n\nleading again to a part that is independent of \u03c6 and an exponentially small \u03c6-dependent term. For the part which\ndoes not depend on \u03c6, we can write\u221a the integrand as\n(f (X +\u01eb)\u2212f (X))2, where f (X) = A/ 1 + e\u03b1X , X = \u01ebx,\nand use Taylor expansion to find the dominant contribution to (47) in the form\n1 2\n1 2 3 3\nA \u03b1\u01eb \u2212\nA \u03b1 \u01eb + O(\u01eb5 ).\n4\n384\nIf the same method is applied for the exponentially small\nterms, it turns out that each term in the Taylor expansion\nyields a contribution that is of the same order after the\nexponentially small integral has been evaluated. Each\nterm gives a contribution proportional to\n\u22122\u03c0 2\nA2\ncos(2\u03c0\u03c6) sin(2\u03c0L)e \u03b1\u01eb ,\n\u03b1\u01eb\n\nwith a different numerical constant. Thus we know the\nscaling but not the magnitude of this term. Since (47) is\nmultiplied by C = \u01eb\u22122 in (37), this term is of the same\norder as the u6 term in (37).\nUsing the above results, the leading terms in the Lagrangian (37) are\n\u0013\n\u0012\nA6\nA2 \u03b1 A4 A6\n2\n4\n.

For these snaking\nbranches, differentiating with respect to L shows that\n\u2206\u03bc \u221d\n\n\u22122\u03c0 2\n1\n\u03b1\u01eb\ncos(2\u03c0L)e\n\u01eb3\n\nso the scaling for the width of the snaking region in (35)\nfor large C is\n\u2206\u03bc \u221d C 3/2 e\u22122\u03c0\n\n2\n\n\u221a\n\nC/3\n\n.\n\n(50)\n\n\f11\n\nScaled snaking width\n\nterns in the quadratic-cubic Swift\u2013Hohenberg equation\nand the discrete bistable Allen\u2013Cahn equation. With a\nsimple ansatz, inspired by asymptotic analysis, the exponentially small terms responsible for the snaking appear\nin the Lagrangian. This enables the branches of snaking\nsolutions to be found, along with the asymmetric 'ladder'\nstates that link these branches.\n\n4\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\nC\n\nFIG. 5:\u221aLog-log plot showing numerically obtained values of\n2\n\u2206\u03bce2\u03c0 C/3 (points) together with the 3/2 scaling law expected according to (50) (line).\n\nFurthermore, differentiating (49) with respect to \u03c6 predicts that the ladder states, with sin(2\u03c0\u03c6) 6= 0, occur for\ninteger values of L.\nTo check the scaling predicted by (50), snaking curves\nfor the equation were obtained numerically using a continuation software method. With 200 grid points it was\npossible to obtain snaking bifurcations up to a value\nC = 14 (at which point the snaking width is of the\norder of 10\u221214 ). Figure 5 shows the numerically obtained snaking width\n\u221a multiplied by the predicted expo2\u03c0 2 C/3\nnential factor e\n. This shows a clear power-law\nbehaviour, with a power very close to the value 3/2 predicted by (50).\n\nThese solutions cannot be found by a conventional\nmultiple-scales method, since they involve a locking\nmechanism between the long and short scales, but are\naccessible through exponential asymptotics [21, 22]. The\nLagrangian approach provides a useful complement to\nthe exponential asymptotics method. Both methods give\nthe same scaling for the relationship between the width\nof the snaking region and the small parameter of the system.\nWe have shown that a close similarity exist between\nthe pinning phenomena in continuous and discrete systems. This arises partly through the fact that the continuous limit of the discrete system considered is exactly\nthe same as the Ginzburg\u2013Landau equation describing\nspatial modulation of the pattern in the continuous case,\nand partly because the sums in the Lagrangian for the\ndiscrete case can be converted into integrals very similar\nto those that appear in the continuous problem.\n\nIn this paper we have used the variational approximation to study the snaking behaviour of localised pat-\n\nThe variational method has a number of advantageous\nfeatures, in addition to the fact that the Lagrangian\nintegral immediately generates the necessary exponentially small terms. Based on the minimisation of the\nLagrangian, it is easy to distinguish between stable equilibria and unstable ones. Furthermore, although we have\nconcentrated on the case of small parameters, for the\npurposes of comparison with asymptotic methods, the\nmethod is not restricted to this regime. In future work it\nmay be possible to apply the method to cases where no\nparameters are small, and make useful comparisons with\nnumerical or experimental results. An additional challenge will be to extend the results to two-dimensional\nsystems [11, 16, 29].\n\n[1] J.H.P. Dawes, Phil Trans. R. Soc. 368, 3519 (2010).\n[2] E.
