Introduction: Analytical methods in quantum mechanics\n\nThe aim of this work is to present the auxiliary field method (AFM), which is a new and\nremarkably simple method to find analytical approximate solutions of eigenequations corresponding to Hamiltonians admitting bound states. The quest for exactly solvable problems\nin quantum physics is actually as old as quantum mechanics itself, and it is worth making\ngeneral comments about this topic before focusing on the auxiliary field method.\nThe most famous systems for which the Schr\u00f6dinger equation admits analytical solutions are probably the harmonic oscillator and the hydrogen atom, i.e. Hamiltonians of the\nform p 2 + r2 and p 2 \u2212 1/r respectively, where p and r are conjugate variables. The spectrum\nof the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator is actually known since 1925 thanks to Heisenberg's pioneering work,1) while the spectrum of the nonrelativistic hydrogen atom was found\nin Schr\u00f6dinger's paper2) as a first and crucial test of his celebrated equation. Notice that the\nsame problem was solved the same year by Pauli.3)\nSince those early results, there has been a considerable amount of works devoted to\nthe computation of analytical solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, especially in bound\nstate problems. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation has been found to be exactly solvable in many\none-dimensional cases: Dirac comb, exponential and linear potentials, . . . However, only a\nfew analytical three-dimensional solutions are known for any value of the angular momentum (the S-wave channel is very similar to a simpler one-dimensional equation). Besides\nthe aforementioned harmonic oscillator and Coulomb cases, one can mention the Kratzer\npotential, the particle in a box and the symmetric top, which are of quite limited use in modeling realistic quantum systems. An exhaustive discussion of quantum problems admitting\nanalytical solutions would be out of the scope of the present introduction; therefore we refer\nthe interested reader to the textbooks,4), 5), 6), 7), 8), 9) in which a wide range of problems is\ncovered.\nWhen exact analytical solutions cannot be found, physicists can either resort to numerical computations or to methods leading to approximate analytical solutions. Even if\nthe computational power that we have at our disposal nowadays allows to solve accurately\nnearly every eigenequation for few body systems, finding approximate analytical formulae\nis always useful in physics, not only because of the intrinsic mathematical interest of such\na task, but also in view of obtaining informations about the dependence of the observables\non the parameters of a model and on the quantum numbers of the states. Calculating an\nanalytical expression being always much less time consuming than solving numerically the\ncorresponding eigenequation, the use of closed formulae can be a great advantage when one\ntries to fit the parameters of a given model to some experimental data, or even to interpret\nnew data. We find worth mentioning here three approximation schemes that are all \"textbook\nmaterial\" and able to lead to analytic results: the WKB or semiclassical approximation, the\nvariational method, and the perturbation theory.\nThe principle of the WKB approximation has been found by Wentzel, Kramers and\nBrillouin around 1926,10) but it is also known that Jeffreys brought important contributions\nto the field in 1924.11) It basically consists in a Taylor expansion of the Hamiltonian and the\nwavefunction in powers of h\u0304. At dominant order for a one-dimensional problem, such an\nR a(E)\nexpansion leads for example to the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule b(E) p(E, x) dx =\n\n\f4\n\n\u03c0 h\u0304(n + 1/2), where p is the classical momentum expressed as a function of the energy and\nof the position x, and where a(E) and b(E) are the turning points of the classical trajectory.\nThe energy spectrum can then be extracted from this integral and is generally accurate,\nbut the explicit expression for E(n) is not always possible to find. One has instead often\nto numerically compute the energy from the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule. Further\ninformations about the semiclassical approximation can be found in e.g. Refs. 4), 7).\nWhile the WKB method is particularly efficient for highly excited states, where h\u0304\nclearly becomes a small parameter, the variational method due to Ritz12) allows to gain\nrelevant informations about the ground state (for a modern presentation see Ref. 13)). Indeed, let us consider a Hamiltonian H and a normalized arbitrary function \u03c8 belonging to L2\nspace. Then, the Ritz theorem states that E0 \u2264 h\u03c8 |H|\u03c8 i, where E0 is the exact ground-state\nenergy. Provided that \u03c8 is chosen such that h\u03c8 |H|\u03c8 i is analytical, one can then obtain an\nanalytical upper bound on the ground-state energy. Typically, one chooses a gaussian- or\nexponential-type wavefunction; many examples of analytical upper bounds can be found in\nRef. 9). Notice also the MacDonald's theorem stating that, given a set of n orthonormalized functions \u03c8i belonging to L2 space, the eigenvalues of the matrix h\u03c8i |H|\u03c8 j i provide\nupper bounds on the n first eigenenergies of H.14) However, analytical results can hardly be\nobtained from such a generalization due to the complexity of the underlying calculations.\nA last technique to be mentioned is the perturbation theory.15) Let us consider that the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation with a potential V is exactly solvable. Then the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nwith potential V + \u03be w can be solved thanks to a Taylor expansion in \u03be provided that this\nparameter is small. At first order in particular, the computation of \u03be hwi with the lowestorder states provides the dominant correction to the whole energy spectrum. Again, a wide\nrange of quantum problems can be studied by using perturbation theory, and we refer to\ne.g.5), 9) for explicit examples in which hwi is analytical.\nThose three methods being presented, it appears that a major challenge remains: To\nfind approximate analytical solutions of eigenequations for the complete spectrum (not only\nthe ground state as with the variational method) without using any Taylor expansion as done\nwith the WKB method or the perturbation theory. The AFM, that will be presented in detail\nin the rest of this work, is an attempt to address that issue.\n\u00a72. Generalities on the auxiliary field method\n\n2.1. Historical aspects\nAuxiliary fields, also known as einbein fields, are used in various domains of theoretical physics. Historically, they have been introduced in order to get rid of the square\nroots typically appearing in relativistic Lagrangians.16), 17) The most\n\u221a obvious example is the\nfree relativistic particle, described by the Lagrangian L = \u2212m \u1e8b2 , where \u1e8b is the worldvelocity. An auxiliary field \u03bc can be introduced in this expression so that one is led to the\nmore convenient form L (\u03bc ) = \u1e8b2 /(2\u03bc ) + m2 \u03bc /2. This last expression is formally simpler\nthan Lagrangian L , but it is equivalent if the equations of motion \u221a\nof the auxiliary field are\nconsidered. The auxiliary field is indeed given on shell by \u03bc0 = \u2212 \u1e8b2 /m, and it is readily\nchecked that L (\u03bc0 ) = L . That feature can be seen as a definition of an auxiliary field: It is\na field whose equation of motion is not dynamical but leads to algebraic relations that allow\n\n\f5\nto express it in terms of the other degrees of freedom of the problem.\nBesides pointlike particles, auxiliary fields have soon become a cornerstone of string\ntheory because\nof the systematic replacement of the Nambu-Goto Lagrangian LNG =\nq\n\n\u2212a d \u03b8\n\n(\u1e87w\u2032 )2 \u2212 \u1e872 w\u2032 2 , in which an unconvenient square root appears, by the Polyakov\n\u221a\nR\nLagrangian LP = \u2212(a/2) d \u03b8 \u2212 det h hbc \u2202b w\u03bc \u2202c w\u03bc , where the induced metric hbc is\nmade of auxiliary fields.18), 19), 20), 21) In connection with string theory, supersymmetric field\ntheories, linking bosons and fermions through supersymmetric transformations, also generally demand the introduction of extra fields \u2013 auxiliary fields \u2013 in order to close the supersymmetric algebra. More information concerning the building of e.g. consistent supergravity theories can be found for example in Refs. 22), 23), 24), 25).\nMore generally, auxiliary fields have become\nwidely used in field theory. Indeed, they\n\u221a\n2\nallow to replace kinetic terms of the form \u1e8b by a formally nonrelativistic term such as\n\u1e8b2 /(2\u03bc ). Computations in the path integral formulation of field theories are then simplified\nbecause one is then formally led to Gaussian path integrals, about which analytical results\nare known.26), 27) In quantum chromodynamics (QCD) for example, the introduction of auxiliary fields has allowed to gain relevant informations about confinement in hadrons within\nthe framework of potential models28), 29) and in particular to give support to the phenomenological QCD string model.30), 31), 32) It is worth mentioning that renormalization problems33)\nas well as numerical computations in N\u2212body systems34), 35) can also be addressed using\nauxiliary fields as a computational tool.\nA particular interest for our purpose is to come back to effective models of QCD. It is\nknown that, in the strong coupling limit, the Wilson loop formulation of QCD supports a\nlinear confinement between a heavy quark and antiquark.36) That result can be generalized\nto light quarks also; it then appears that the effective confining interaction in mesonic systems can be modeled by a Nambu-Goto string linking the quark with the antiquark,37) whose\ndominant contribution is indeed a linear potential of type a r. An idea that is already present\nin Refs. 28), 29) is to introduce an additional auxiliary field, \u03bd , in a way similar to what is\ndone for relativistic kinetic terms: a r can be replaced by a2 r2 /(2\u03bd ) + \u03bd /2, formally reducing the linear potential to a harmonic oscillator, for which analytical solutions are known.\nOf course the remaining auxiliary field has eventually to be eliminated, but analytical approximate mass formulae for mesons and baryons can be found following this philosophy.\nThe question underlying the present report is nothing else but an attempt to generalize such\na procedure, namely: Could any arbitrary potential appearing in an eigenequation be approximated by an expression involving an auxiliary field and another potential for which an\nanalytical solution is known? As we shall see in the following, an affirmative answer can\nbe given to that question, leading to a method allowing to compute approximate analytical\nenergy formulae of various eigenequations. Moreover the method can be generalized to treat\nproblems involving more than 1 or 2 particles.\nR\n\n2.2. The auxiliary field method\nThe most general form that we consider for the eigenvalue equation of a one- or twobody problem in first quantized quantum mechanics is\nH|\u03c8 i = [T (pp) +V (r)] |\u03c8 i = E|\u03c8 i.\n\n(2.1)\n\n\f6\nThe potential V in the Hamiltonian H depends on the variable r = |rr | which is the distance\nfrom the center of forces in a one-body problem and the relative distance between the two\nparticles in a two-body problem. The kinetic part T depends on the momentum operator\np which is the conjugate variable of r . Practically, we will consider a nonrelativistic form\np2 /(2m) (m is the particle mass for a one-body problem or the reduced\npmass of a two-body\nsystem) as in the Schr\u00f6dinger equation and a semirelativistic one \u03c3 p 2 + m2 (\u03c3 = 1 for\none-body problems and \u03c3 = 2 for two identical particles) as in a spinless Salpeter equation.\nAn exact analytical expression for all the eigenvalues is known explicitly only for\nvery specific potentials P(r) with a nonrelativistic kinetic parts: the quadratic interaction\nP(r) = r2 (harmonic oscillator) and the Coulomb potential P(r) = \u22121/r (hydrogen-like\nsystem) are the most familiar for a practical use. An exact expression is known for a number\nof other potentials, but only for S-waves (see Ref. 9) for a more detailed discussion) or for\none-dimensional problems.\nOur goal is the search for approximate analytical solutions for the Hamiltonian of type\n(2.1), relying on Hamiltonians for which solutions are well-known. In other words, we\nassume that we are able to obtain an analytical solution for the equation\nh(a)|ai = [T (pp) + aP(r)] |ai = e(a) |ai ,\n\n(2.2)\n\nin which, at this stage, a is a real parameter. This method was formulated and applied for\nthe first time in Ref. 38).\nWe summarize here the principle of the method introducing an auxiliary field, which is\na priori an operator. It consists in four steps:\n1. We calculate the function K(r) (the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the\nargument of the function)\nV \u2032 (r)\n(2.3)\nK(r) = \u2032 .\nP (r)\n2. We denote by J = K \u22121 the inverse function of K. Thus, one has\nK(r) = z and\n\nJ(z) = r.\n\n(2.4)\n\nSince both V (r) and P(r) do exhibit an analytical form, the same property holds for\nK(r). But it is by no means sure that J(z) can be expressed analytically. We will see in\nthe following that an explicit analytical expression for J is not necessary to write down\nthe basic equations.\n3. We introduce the \"bridge function\" B defined by\nB(y) = V (J(y)) \u2212 yP(J(y)).\n\n(2.5)\n\nThe name of this function comes from the fact that it makes a bridge between the\npotential P(r) for which an analytical expression for the energies is known and the\npotential V (r) for which the corresponding analytical expression is a priori not known.\nLastly, it is interesting to define the AFM potential \u1e7c through\n\u1e7c (r, y) = yP(r) + B(y).\n\n(2.6)\n\nIt depends not only on the position operator as the original potential V (r), but also\non the y variable, which is undetermined at this stage. The AFM Hamiltonian is now\n\n\f7\ndefined as\nH\u0303(y) = T (pp) + \u1e7c (r, y) = h(y) + B(y).\n\n(2.7)\n\nThe construction of H\u0303 seems rather artificial and one can wonder what could be the\njustification of such a procedure. In fact, there is no mystery.\nLet us suppose that the y variable is an operator denoted \u03bd\u0302 . It plays the role of an\nauxiliary field, not present in the original Hamiltonian H, but which is an essential\ningredient of the AFM Hamiltonian H\u0303. Among the infinite number of possibilities for\nthe auxiliary field \u03bd\u0302 , let us choose a very specific one \u03bd\u03020 defined by\n\n\u03bd\u03020 = K(r).\n\n(2.8)\n\nA more explicit notation would be \u03bd\u03020 (r) indicating clearly that it is an operator depending on the position only. The very important property is that \u03bd\u03020 , coming from\n(2.8), is an extremum the AFM Hamiltonian, i.e.\n\n\u03b4 H\u0303(\u03bd\u0302 )\n\u03b4 \u03bd\u0302\n\n\u03bd\u0302 =\u03bd\u03020\n\n= 0.\n\n(2.9)\n\nMoreover, one has the additional property that the value of the AFM Hamiltonian taken\nfor this operator coincides with the original Hamiltonian H\nH\u0303(\u03bd\u03020 ) = H.\n\n(2.10)\n\nThese properties are easy to show and follow from the definitions (2.3), (2.4) and (2.8).\nThus, considering the auxiliary field as an operator and affecting it the value given by\n(2.8) is just an alternative method to solve the original problem.\n4. The philosophy of the AFM is to consider the y variable, no longer as an operator \u03bd\u0302 ,\nbut as a pure real number \u03bd . In this case the AFM potential \u1e7c (r, \u03bd ) is of the form\n\u03bd P(r) + B(\u03bd ) where \u03bd and B(\u03bd ) are no longer operators but must be considered as\narbitrary constants. Taking into account (2.2), the eigenvalues of H\u0303(\u03bd ) are\nE(\u03bd ) = e(\u03bd ) + B(\u03bd ),\n\n(2.11)\n\nwhere e(\u03bd ) are the eigenvalues of h(\u03bd ) which are supposed to be known whatever the\nradial and orbital quantum numbers n, l. Provided that the J function is calculable, the\nsame property is true for E(\u03bd ). Then, we determine the value \u03bd0 that extremizes E(\u03bd ):\n\n\u2202 E(\u03bd )\n\u2202\u03bd\n\n\u03bd =\u03bd0\n\n= 0.\n\n(2.12)\n\nWe propose to consider E(\u03bd0 ) as the approximate form of the exact energy E of the\nHamiltonian H\n(2.13)\nE \u2248 EAFM = E(\u03bd0 ).\nIn order to obtain an analytical expression for the eigenvalues EAFM , we must then\nfulfill a second necessary condition: to be able to determine \u03bd0 and, then, E(\u03bd0 ) in an\nanalytical way. Denoting |\u03bd i the eigenstate of H\u0303(\u03bd ) corresponding to the eigenvalue\nE(\u03bd ), we consider |\u03bd0 i as an approximation of the corresponding genuine eigenstate\nof H.\n\n\f8\nPresented as such, this procedure appears to be an empirical recipe. Arguments given in\nthe third item show that this prescription makes sense and that the AFM must be considered\nin essence as a mean field approximation. This point will be developed more deeply below.\nAnother interesting property concerning the AFM potential (2.6) is the following. Let\nus denote by r0 the value of the radius defined by\n\n\u03bd0 = K(r0 ) and r0 = J(\u03bd0 ).\n\n(2.14)\n\nIt is just a matter of simple calculation to verify that the AFM potential taken for the special\nvalue y = \u03bd0 can be recast as\n\u1e7c (r, \u03bd0 ) = \u03bd0 [P(r) \u2212 P(r0 )] +V (r0 ).\n\n(2.15)\n\nOwing to the definition of the K function (2.3), one can easily show that the AFM potential\ncoincides both to the exact potential and its derivative at the point r = r0 , namely\n\u1e7c (r0 , \u03bd0 ) = V (r0 ) and \u1e7c \u2032 (r0 , \u03bd0 ) = V \u2032 (r0 ).\n\n(2.16)\n\nIn other words, at this particular point r0 , the AFM potential and the exact potential are\ntangent curves. This property will be exploited in Sect. 2.4 in connection with the envelope\ntheory (see Appendix A).\nLet us note by |\u03bd i an eigenstate of H\u0303(\u03bd ). The Hellmann-Feynman theorem39) states\nthat\n\u001d\n\u001c\n\u2202 E(\u03bd )\n\u2202 H\u0303(\u03bd )\n(2.17)\n= \u03bd\n\u03bd .\n\u2202\u03bd\n\u2202\u03bd\nUsing this relation, one can show that38)\nh\u03bd0 | P(r) |\u03bd0 i = P(r0 ).\n\n(2.18)\n\nThis means that r0 is a kind of \"average point\" for the potential P(r). That is why it will be\noften called \"the mean radius\" in the following. Using this last relation with the definitions\nabove, we get\nh\u03bd0 |Z(\u03bd\u03020 )|\u03bd0 i = Z(\u03bd0 ) with Z(x) = P(J(x)).\n(2.19)\nSo, our method can actually be considered as a \"mean field approximation\" with respect\nto a particular auxiliary field which is introduced to simplify the calculations: \u03bd0 is the\nmean value of the operator \u03bd\u03020 = K(r) through a function Z which can be quite simple. For\nexample, Z(x) = x if V (x) = P(x)2 /2 +V0 where V0 is a constant.\nIt is in the step of passing from an operator to a constant interpretation for the auxiliary field that lies the approximation. It is clear that the quality of the approximate results\nstrongly depends on the choice of the function P(r). The cleverness of the physicist relies\nin his ability to guess a form for P(r) as close as possible of V (r) while leading to a manageable form of the corresponding eigenvalues e(\u03bd ). A big bulk of this report is devoted to\nthe discussion of the quality of this approximation.\nThis method is completely general and a priori valid for any potential V (r). Of course,\nall the four steps mentioned above can be done numerically so that EAFM can be computed\nnumerically. But it seems that the corresponding numerical treatment is as heavy as solving\n\n\f9\ndirectly the eigenvalue equation to get lastly a poorer result. This is true if we start with an\narbitrary function P(r). However we have the complete freedom for this choice.\nLet us assume that, for a kinetic part T , we do start with a potential P allowing to obtain\nanalytical results for its eigenvalues e(\u03bd ) (e(\u03bd ) is a shorthand notation for the most correct\nexpression e(\u03bd ; n, l)); the same is true of course for its derivative with respect to \u03bd : e\u2032 (\u03bd ).\nUsing the definition of the K and J functions defined previously, it is easy to show that\nE \u2032 (\u03bd ) = e\u2032 (\u03bd ) \u2212 P(J(\u03bd )).\n\n(2.20)\n\nThe determination of \u03bd0 results from the condition E \u2032 (\u03bd0 ) = 0, that is to say\ne\u2032 (\u03bd0 ) = P(J(\u03bd0 )).\n\n(2.21)\n\nIt appears that obtaining the \u03bd0 value requires only to solve a transcendental equation. Once\nthis value is obtained, the AFM energy is very easy to calculate\nEAFM = E(\u03bd0 ) = e(\u03bd0 ) + B(\u03bd0 ).\n\n(2.22)\n\nThus, provided that we have an analytical expression for e(\u03bd ), the AFM results only need\nsolving a transcendental equation, a much easier procedure than solving exactly the genuine\neigenvalue equation.\nThe practical usefulness of the AFM method is to get a final solution which is completely analytical. In order to do that, we must fulfill, as we saw, three conditions:\n1. to choose a P function leading to analytical expression for e(\u03bd );\n2. to be able to invert relation (2.8) in order to have access to the function J defined by\n(2.4) (it appears into the B function);\n3. to be able to determine \u03bd0 (through (2.21)) and to calculate the corresponding value\nE(\u03bd0 ) in an analytical way.\nIn fact, the second condition is formally not necessary. Indeed, let us introduce the mean\nradius r0 = J(\u03bd0 ). Then \u03bd0 = K(r0 ) so that the bridge function is expressed as\nB(\u03bd0 ) = V (r0 ) \u2212 K(r0 )P(r0 ) = B(r0 ),\n\n(2.23)\n\nwhere, for simplicity, we still maintain the notation B: B = V \u2212 KP. The transcendental\nequation (2.21) is transformed into\ne\u2032 (K(r0 )) = P(r0 ),\n\n(2.24)\n\nEAFM = E(\u03bd0 ) = e(K(r0 )) + B(r0 ).\n\n(2.25)\n\nwhile the energy is given by\n\nUsing the expression (2.23) for B(r0 ) and the definition of e(\u03bd ), this last formula can be\nrecast under the form\nEAFM = T0 +V (r0 ),\n(2.26)\nwhere, according to (2.18),\nT0 = e(K(r0 )) \u2212 K(r0 )P(r0 ) = h\u03bd0 | T (pp) |\u03bd0 i\n\n(2.27)\n\n\f10\nis an average kinetic energy.\nIn this new formulation, any reference to the J function has disappeared so that it is\nnot necessary to try to get it. However, solving analytically the transcendental equation\n(2.24) is more or less of the same difficulty than getting an analytical expression for the J\nfunction. Anyhow, this new formulation leads very often to simpler practical calculations\nand is preferred most of the time.\nIt is important to stress the following point: if P(r) is chosen to be V (r), it is trivial to\ncheck that K(r) = 1, B(r) = 0, r0 is meaningless since obviously P(r) and V (r) are tangent\ncurves everywhere, and EAFM = e(1) which is precisely the exact value E. In this particular\ncase, AFM recovers the exact result. This property is sometimes used to check special\nresults.\n2.3. Scaling laws\nScaling laws represent an important property for quantum mechanical systems. They\nallow to give the expression for the eigenenergies (and wavefunctions) of the most general equation in terms of the corresponding eigenenergies (and wavefunctions) of a reduced\nequation with less parameters. In fact, the scaling laws are nothing else than a direct consequence of dimensional analysis applied to the various dimensioned parameters entering the\nproblem. Starting from a general Hamiltonian H(\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1n ) depending on n dimensioned\nparameters \u03b1i , it is generally possible to write\nH(\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1n ) = \u03b3 h(\u03b21 , . . . , \u03b2m ),\n\n(2.28)\n\nwhere \u03b3 has the dimension of an energy and where h is a Hamiltonian expressed in terms\nof dimensionless conjugate variables and depending on m < n dimensionless parameters \u03b2i .\nThe scaling properties of the nonrelativistic Schr\u00f6dinger equation have been studied and\nused for a long time, but spinless Salpeter equations also benefit of scaling properties. They\nwill be explicitly described below. In the following, in order to lighten the notations, the\nAFM will be generally applied to dimensionless Hamiltonians as in Refs. 38), 40), 41). So,\nthe exact and the AFM solutions automatically share the same scaling properties.\n2.4. Eigenstates and upper/lower bounds\nIf E(\u03bd0 ), which is an eigenvalue of H\u0303(\u03bd0 ), is an approximation of the exact energy E,\nthe corresponding eigenstate |\u03bd0 i is an approximation of a genuine eigenstate of H. The\nshape of the corresponding wavefunction hrr |\u03bd0 i depends on the quantum numbers via the\nparameter \u03bd0 or the mean radius r0 . Practically, only nonrelativistic harmonic oscillator or\nnonrelativistic Coulomb wavefunctions can be used. Explicit examples will be presented\nbelow.\nSince the potential \u1e7c (r, \u03bd0 ) is tangent to the potential V (r) at r = r0 , and since H and\nH\u0303(\u03bd0 ) have the same kinetic part, the comparison theorem42), 43), 44) (for both nonrelativistic\nand relativistic equations) implies that the approximation E(\u03bd0 ) is an upper (lower) bound\non the exact energy if \u1e7c (r, \u03bd0 ) \u2265 V (r) (\u1e7c (r, \u03bd0 ) \u2264 V (r)) for all values of r. Equivalently, a\nfunction g(x) can be defined by\nV (x) = g(P(x)).\n(2.29)\nIt can then be shown that, if g(x) is a concave (convex) function, that is if g\u2032\u2032 (x) \u2264 0 (g\u2032\u2032 (x) \u2265\n0) \u2200x, the approximation E(\u03bd0 ) is an upper (lower) bound on the exact energy. This property\n\n\f11\nhas been demonstrated in the framework of the envelope theory,45) but can be applied as well\nto the AFM.46) Several examples will be presented below.\nThe knowledge of lower and upper bounds on an eigenstate is a first technique to estimate the accuracy of the AFM. It has also been shown that38)\nE(\u03bd0 ) \u2212 h\u03bd0 |H|\u03bd0 i = V (r0 ) \u2212 h\u03bd0 |V (r)|\u03bd0 i.\n\n(2.30)\n\nThe right-hand side of this equation is the difference between the value of potential V computed at the average point r0 and the average of this potential for the AFM state |\u03bd0 i considered here as trial state. In some favorable cases (the trial state is a ground state for instance),\nE \u2264 h\u03bd0 |H|\u03bd0 i and a bound on the error can be computed by\nE(\u03bd0 ) \u2212 E \u2265 V (r0 ) \u2212 h\u03bd0 |V (r)|\u03bd0 i.\n\n(2.31)\n\nIf the mean value of V can be computed analytically, this constitutes a second procedure\nto estimate the accuracy of the AFM. Several examples of this calculation are presented in\nRef. 38). At last, the eigenstates of a Hamiltonian of type (2.1) can be solved numerically\nwith an arbitrary precision. So, as a third possibility, a direct comparison with the AFM\nresults is always possible. So, one can wonder why to use the AFM? Let us recall that the\ninterest of this method is mainly to obtain analytical information about the whole spectra\n(dependence of eigenenergies on the parameters of the Hamiltonian and on the quantum\nnumbers), without necessarily searching a very high accuracy. Moreover, the AFM approximation can be extended to N-body problems for which exact eigenenergies are not easily\nreachable, even numerically.\nIn some cases, it is possible to compute analytically the mean value E \u2217 (\u03bd0 ) = h\u03bd0 |H|\u03bd0 i,\nconsidering the AFM solution |\u03bd0 i as a trial state (see Sect. 3.3 for two examples). We have\nthen\nE \u2217 (\u03bd0 ) \u2212 E(\u03bd0 ) = h\u03bd0 |H \u2212 H\u0303(\u03bd0 )|\u03bd0 i = h\u03bd0 |V (r) \u2212 \u1e7c (r, \u03bd0 )|\u03bd0 i = \u2206 V.\n\n(2.32)\n\nIf g(x) is concave, E(\u03bd0 ) \u2265 E and \u1e7c (r, \u03bd0 ) \u2265 V (r). In this case, \u2206 V \u2264 0 and E \u2217 (\u03bd0 ) \u2264\nE(\u03bd0 ). By the Ritz theorem, we know that E \u2217 (\u03bd0 ) \u2265 E for the ground state. For this state, it\nis interesting to compute the mean value E \u2217 (\u03bd \u2217 ) = h\u03bd \u2217 |H|\u03bd \u2217 i, where |\u03bd \u2217 i is an eigenstate of\nH\u0303(\u03bd \u2217 ) with \u03bd \u2217 determined in order to minimize the energy E \u2217 (\u03bd \u2217 ). We have then E \u2217 (\u03bd \u2217 ) \u2264\nE \u2217 (\u03bd0 ) since the parameter \u03bd0 is fixed by the AFM computation.\nIf g(x) is convex, E(\u03bd0 ) \u2264 E and \u1e7c (r, \u03bd0 ) \u2264 V (r). Thus, \u2206 V \u2265 0 and E \u2217 (\u03bd0 ) \u2265 E(\u03bd0 ).\nIn this case, we have also E \u2217 (\u03bd0 ) \u2265 E and E \u2217 (\u03bd \u2217 ) \u2264 E \u2217 (\u03bd0 ) for the ground state.\nWe can gather these results to obtain:\n\u2022 If g(x) is concave or equivalently \u1e7c (r, \u03bd0 ) \u2265 V (r):\n\u2013 For the ground state, E(\u03bd0 ) \u2265 E \u2217 (\u03bd0 ) \u2265 E \u2217 (\u03bd \u2217 ) \u2265 E;\n\u2013 For the other states, E(\u03bd0 ) \u2265 E and E(\u03bd0 ) \u2265 E \u2217 (\u03bd0 ).\n\n\u2022 If g(x) is convex or equivalently \u1e7c (r, \u03bd0 ) \u2264 V (r):\n\n\u2013 For the ground state, E \u2217 (\u03bd0 ) \u2265 E \u2217 (\u03bd \u2217 ) \u2265 E \u2265 E(\u03bd0 );\n\u2013 For the other states, E \u2265 E(\u03bd0 ) and E \u2217 (\u03bd0 ) \u2265 E(\u03bd0 ).\n\nThe results mentioned above are directly applicable if H and H\u0303(\u03bd0 ) have the same\nkinetic part. This is always the case for nonrelativistic Hamiltonians but not for the spinless\n\n\f12\nSalpeter Hamiltonians, whose treatment requires generally the replacement of the square\nroot operator by a nonrelativistic operator. The bounds on these kinds of Hamiltonians are\nspecifically studied in Sect. 5.\n2.4.1. Extension to the form aP(r) +V (r)\nIf the AFM is applicable for some potentials V1 (r) and V2 (r) independently, there is\nno certainty that it still applies for a potential which is their sum: V (r) = V1 (r) + V2 (r).\nHowever, the method can be used in the case where one of the potentials Vi can be identified\nwith the basic P potential. Thus, in this section we consider a Hamiltonian of type\nHa = T (pp) + aP(r) +V (r),\n\n(2.33)\n\nwhose exact eigenvalues are denoted Ea . The extension of AFM to potentials of this type was\nfirst presented in Ref. 40). One introduces an auxiliary field \u03bd as before, forgetting about the\naP(r) contribution. The first 3 steps of the algorithm remain unchanged. Thus the \u03bd\u03020 field\nis the same, as is the same the function B(\u03bd ). The only difference arises in the expression\n(2.7) of H\u0303 and h where \u03bd P(r) has to be replaced by (a + \u03bd )P(r). As a consequence, the\ncorresponding energy (2.11) has to be replaced by\nEa (\u03bd ) = e(a + \u03bd ) + B(\u03bd ).\n\n(2.34)\n\nEa (\u03bd ) is an eigenvalue of Hamiltonian\nH\u0303a (\u03bd ) = h(a + \u03bd ) + B(\u03bd ),\n\n(2.35)\n\nwhere h is defined by (2.2) and where e(a + \u03bd ) is an eigenvalue of Hamiltonian h(a + \u03bd ).\nAn eigenstate of Hamiltonians H\u0303a and h(a + \u03bd ) is denoted |a + \u03bd i, and we have e(a + \u03bd ) =\nha + \u03bd |h(a + \u03bd )|a + \u03bd i. If \u03bd0 is the value of \u03bd which extremizes (2.34), then we could expect\nthat\nEa (\u03bd0 ) = e(a + \u03bd0 ) + B(\u03bd0 )\n(2.36)\nis a good approximation of Ea , an exact eigenvalue of Hamiltonian (2.33). It seems that\n(2.34) is very similar to (2.11), the only difference being the replacement of \u03bd by a + \u03bd in\nthe argument of the function e(\u03bd ). Nevertheless, this small difference is important, because,\neven if the determination of \u03bd0 from (2.11) is technically easy and analytical, it may happen\nthat its determination from (2.34) could be much more involved and very often not analytical. The alternative formulation in terms of r0 is also slightly modified in this case. The\ntranscendental equation now writes\ne\u2032 (a + K(r0 )) = P(r0 )\n\n(2.37)\n\nEAFM = e(a + K(r0 )) + B(r0 ).\n\n(2.38)\n\nand the AFM energy is given by\n\nUsing again the Hellmann-Feynman theorem,39) it can be shown that\nha + \u03bd0 |P(r)|a + \u03bd0 i = P (J(\u03bd0 )) = P(r0 ).\n\n(2.39)\n\n\f13\nSo, J(\u03bd0 ) = r0 is also in this case a kind of \"average point\" for the potential P(r). Recalling\nthat Z(x) = P(J(x)), we have\nha + \u03bd0 |Z(\u03bd\u0302 )|a + \u03bd0 i = Z(\u03bd0 ).\n\n(2.40)\n\nWe confirm also in this case the \"mean field approximation\" with respect to a particular\nauxiliary field which is introduced to simplify the calculations.\n2.5. Recursion procedure\nAn idea for obtaining analytical expressions of the eigenenergies for an arbitrary potential is the following (see also Ref. 40)). We start with a potential P(r) = P[0] (r) for which\nthe energies of the corresponding Hamiltonian H [0] are exactly known. We then proceed as\nabove to find approximate solutions for the eigenenergies of a Hamiltonian H [1] in which the\npotential is at present V (r) = P[1] (r). In general, a large class of potentials can be treated in\nthat way. Moreover, as we will see below, by comparison with accurate numerical results,\nwe can even refine the expressions so that analytical forms for the energies are very close to\nthe exact solutions.\nConsidering now these approximate expressions as the exact ones, we apply once more\nthe AFM with P(r) = P[1] (r) to obtain approximate solutions for the eigenenergies of a\nHamiltonian H [2] in which the potential is at present V (r) = P[2] (r). Even if analytical\nsolutions for Hamiltonian H [2] were not attainable directly with P(r) = P[0] (r), it may occur\nthat they indeed are with P(r) = P[1] (r). Pursuing recursively such a procedure, one can\nimagine to get analytical solutions for increasingly complicated potentials. Presumably, the\nquality of the analytical expressions deteriorates with the order of the recursion.\n\u00a73. Schr\u00f6dinger equation with a power-law potential\n\nIn this section, we discuss in detail the case of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with a powerlaw potential for two reasons. First, it is a simple case to illustrate the AFM. Second, as we\nwill see below, this kind of potentials is in the thick of our method. The Hamiltonian can be\nwritten\np2\nH=\n(3.1)\n+ sgn(\u03bb ) a r\u03bb ,\n2m\nwhere a is a strictly positive constant and where the sign function is defined by sgn(\u03bb ) =\n\u03bb /|\u03bb | with \u03bb 6= 0. The physical values of \u03bb must be such that \u03bb \u2265 \u22122, otherwise the\nwave equation leads to a collapse. The two unavoidable starting potentials P(r) = r2 and\nP(r) = \u22121/r are indeed two particular cases of power-law potentials. In fact, the only\ninteresting values studied in this paper are those comprised between these extreme values:\n\u22121 \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 2. They represent most of the physical applications. For example, the linear\npotential \u03bb = 1 is the traditional form of the confining potential in hadronic physics,32), 47), 48)\nthe value \u03bb = 2/3 was shown to give the good slope for Regge trajectories in nonrelativistic\ntreatment49) and \u03bb = 0.1 was considered by Martin.50)\nThe energy E of (3.1) depends on the physical parameters m, a, \u03bb but also on the\nquantum numbers n (radial) and l (orbital). It is easy to show that the scaling laws allow to\nwrite\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n2\n(3.2)\nE(m, a, \u03bb ; n, l) = 2 \u03bb +2 a \u03bb +2 m\u2212 \u03bb +2 \u03b5 (\u03bb ; n, l),\n\n\f14\nwhere \u03b5 (\u03bb ; n, l) is the eigenvalue of equation\nH=\n\np2\n+ sgn(\u03bb )r\u03bb .\n4\n\n(3.3)\n\nThis form is chosen in order to match the conventions of Ref. 38). The scaling laws are\nunable to say anything about the dependence of \u03b5 on the power \u03bb and on the quantum\nnumbers (n, l). It is the virtue of the AFM to shed some light on these very important\nquestions.\nAn another interesting potential is the logarithmic potential, discussed for instance in\nRef. 51)\nV (r) = a ln(b r).\n(3.4)\nIt is in strong connection with the power-law interaction since it can be rewritten into a\nsimilar form\n1\nln x = lim (x\u03bb \u2212 1).\n(3.5)\n\u03bb \u21920 \u03bb\nUsing the the scaling law, we can write\nE(m, a, b) =\n\n2b2\n\u03b5 (\u03b2 ) with\nm\n\n\u03b2=\n\nma\n,\n2b2\n\n(3.6)\n\nwhere \u03b5 (\u03b2 ) is the eigenenergy of the reduced Schr\u00f6dinger Hamiltonian\nh=\n\np2\n+ \u03b2 ln r.\n4\n\n(3.7)\n\nWe will apply the AFM for these two interactions with the two starting potentials P(r) =\nr2 and P(r) = \u22121/r. Let us note that a number of results presented in the following sections\nhave been already obtained in the framework of the envelope theory.45) Nevertheless we\nremind them in order to keep some consistency in our presentation.\n3.1. Energies with P(r) = r2\nThe harmonic oscillator (HO) Hamiltonian h(\u03bd ) = p 2 /4 + \u03bd r2 has the following eigenvalues\n\u221a\n(3.8)\ne(\u03bd ) = \u03bd QHO with QHO = 2n + l + 3/2.\nIn the following, a combination of quantum numbers as in QHO (QHO is a simplified notation\nfor QHO (n, l)) will be denoted \"principal quantum number\".\nLet us apply the AFM for the p\npower-law potential V (r) = sgn(\u03bb )r\u03bb . Wephave then\nK(r) = |\u03bb |r\u03bb \u22122 /2, e(K(r)) = QHO |\u03bb |/2r(\u03bb \u22122)/2 , e\u2032 (K(r)) = QHO r(2\u2212\u03bb )/2 / 2|\u03bb | and\nB(r) = ((2 \u2212 \u03bb )/2)V (r). The transcendental equation (2.24) for the extremization of the\nenergy leads to the value of the mean radius\n\u0014 2 \u00151/(\u03bb +2)\nQHO\nr0 =\n.\n(3.9)\n2|\u03bb |\n\nInserting this value in E(r0 ) (2.25) gives the AFM approximation of the eigenenergy\n\n\u03b5AFM (\u03bb ; n, l) =\n\n2\u03bb\n2\n\u03bb\n2+\u03bb\n2+\u03bb\n|\u03bb | 2+\u03bb 2\u2212 2+\u03bb QHO\n.\n2\u03bb\n\n(3.10)\n\n\f15\nIt is important to emphasize that this value is an upper bound on the exact energy for the\ndomain of \u03bb we are interested in. Moreover, putting \u03bb = 2 in the previous expression, one\nrecovers the exact result \u03b5AFM (2; n, l) = \u03b5 (2; n, l) = QHO , as expected.\nLet us consider nowp\nthe logarithmic potential V (r)\np = \u03b2 ln r. We have then K(r) =\n\u2032\n2\n\u03b2 /(2r ), e(K(r)) = QHO \u03b2 /2/r, e (K(r)) = rQHO / 2\u03b2 and B(r) = V (r) \u2212 \u03b2 /2. The\ntranscendental equation (2.24) for the extremization of the energy leads to the value of the\nmean radius\nQHO\nr0 = p .\n(3.11)\n2\u03b2\nInserting this value in E(r0 ) (2.25) gives the AFM approximation of the eigenenergy\n\u0014r\n\u0015\ne\n\u03b5AFM (\u03b2 ; n, l) = \u03b2 ln\nQHO .\n(3.12)\n2\u03b2\nIt is well known that the eigenenergies E(m, a, b; n, l) resulting from a Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nwith the potential (3.4) satisfy the property51)\na\nE(\u03b1 m, a, b; n, l) = E(m, a, b; n, l) \u2212 ln \u03b1 .\n(3.13)\n2\nThe immediate consequence is that the corresponding spectrum is independent of the mass\nof the particle. It is remarkable that the basic property (3.13) still holds for our approximate\nexpression (3.12).\nIt is worth mentioning that the energy formula (3.12) can be understood as a particular\nlimit case of formula (3.2), as it was suggested in Ref. 47). Guided by (3.5), let us consider\nthe following Hamiltonian\ni\np2 \u03b2 h \u03bb\n+\nx \u22121 .\n(3.14)\nH(\u03bb ) =\n4\n\u03bb\nIt reduces to the Hamiltonian (3.7) in the limit \u03bb \u2192 0. A simple rewriting of formula (3.2)\nfor a \u2192 \u03b2 /|\u03bb | and m = 2 gives the eigenenergies of Hamiltonian (3.14). We have thus\n2\n\n\u03bb\n\u03b2\n2 + \u03bb \u03b2 \u03bb +2 \u03bb2+2\nQHO \u2212 ,\nE(\u03bb ) =\n\u03bb\n2\u03bb 2 \u03bb +2\n\u03bb\n\n(3.15)\n\nand as expected\nlim E(\u03bb ) = \u03b2 ln\n\n\u03bb \u21920\n\n\u0014r\n\n\u0015\ne\nQHO ,\n2\u03b2\n\n(3.16)\n\nthat is precisely formula (3.12), directly obtained from the logarithmic potential. This confirms the idea that the logarithmic potential can be seen as the limit of a power-law potential\nr\u03bb when \u03bb goes to zero. The same conclusion was obtained with the envelope theory (see\nRef. 52)).\n3.2. Energies with P(r) = \u22121/r\n\nNow we consider the Coulomb (C) Hamiltonian h(\u03bd ) = p 2 /4 \u2212 \u03bd /r whose eigenvalues\nare given by (QC is a simplified notation for QC (n, l))\ne(\u03bd ) = \u2212\n\n\u03bd2\nQC2\n\nwith\n\nQC = n + l + 1.\n\n(3.17)\n\n\f16\nLet us apply the AFM for the power-law potential V (r) = sgn(\u03bb )r\u03bb . We have then\nK(r) = |\u03bb |r\u03bb +1 , e(K(r)) = \u2212r2\u03bb +2 (|\u03bb |2 /QC2 ), e\u2032 (K(r)) = \u2212r\u03bb +1 (2|\u03bb |/QC2 ) and B(r) = (1+\n\u03bb )V (r). The transcendental equation (2.24) for the extremization of the energy leads to the\nvalue of the mean radius\n\u0014 2 \u00151/(\u03bb +2)\nQC\n.\n(3.18)\nr0 =\n2|\u03bb |\nInserting this value in E(r0 ) (2.25) gives the AFM approximation of the eigenenergy\n\n\u03b5AFM (\u03bb ; n, l) =\n\n2\u03bb\n2\n\u03bb\n2+\u03bb\n|\u03bb | 2+\u03bb 2\u2212 2+\u03bb QC2+\u03bb .\n2\u03bb\n\n(3.19)\n\nIt is important to emphasize that this value is a lower bound on the exact energy. Putting \u03bb =\n\u22121 in the previous expression, one recovers the exact result \u03b5AFM (\u22121; n, l) = \u03b5 (\u22121; n, l) =\n\u22121/QC2 , as expected. It is worth noting that formulae (3.10) and (3.19) exhibit the same\nformal expression with just the exchange QC \u2194 QHO . This important point will be discussed\nin Sect. 4.2.\nThe resolution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with the logarithmic potential in (3.7) is\neven simpler with the present choice of P(r). Indeed, one finds in this case K(r) = \u03b2 r,\ne(K(r)) = \u2212(r\u03b2 /QC )2 , e\u2032 (K(r)) = \u22122\u03b2 r2 /QC2 and B(r) = V (r) + \u03b2 . The transcendental\nequation (2.24) leads to the value of the mean radius\nQC\nr0 = p .\n2\u03b2\n\n(3.20)\n\nInserting this value in E(r0 ) (2.25) gives the AFM approximation of the eigenenergy\n\u0014r\n\u0015\ne\n\u03b5AFM (\u03b2 ; n, l) = \u03b2\nQC .\n(3.21)\n2\u03b2\nAgain, formulae (3.12) and (3.21) exhibit the same formal expression with just the exchange\nQC \u2194 QHO . Consequently, the properties mentioned above concerning the spectrum and the\nlimit of a power-law potential when \u03bb \u2192 0 still hold in this case.\n3.3. Wavefunctions and observables\nIn this section, the quality of the wavefunction hrr |\u03bd0 i given by the AFM is tested for the\nSchr\u00f6dinger Hamiltonian with the linear potential (results for logarithmic and exponential\npotentials are presented in Ref. 53)). This Hamiltonian is chosen because it can be solved\nanalytically for a vanishing angular momentum l (see Appendix G). When l 6= 0, numerical results have been obtained with two different methods.54), 55) In order to simplify the\nnotation, we will denote |n, li an eigenstate of H and |ni = |n, 0i, with hrr |ni given by (G.3).\nThe corresponding energies will be denoted En,l = hn, l|H|n, li and En = En,0 = hn|H|ni.\nAs we need a Hamiltonian H\u0303 with a central potential which is completely solvable to apply\nthe AFM, we can only use in practice a hydrogen-like system (P(r) = \u22121/r) or a harmonic\noscillator (P(r) = r2 ). As a linear potential seems closer to r2 than \u22121/r, we can expect that\nthe use of a harmonic oscillator to start the AFM will give better results. Using the scaling\nproperties, we can consider the following simple Hamiltonian\nH = p 2 + r,\n\n(3.22)\n\n\f17\nin order to match the conventions of Ref. 53).\nAs it is shown in the previous section, the approximate AFM energies, denoted here by\n\u03b5n,l , are given by\n3\n\u03b5n,l = 2/3 Q2/3 ,\n(3.23)\n2\nwith Q = 2n + l + 3/2 for P(r) = r2 and Q = n + l + 1 for P(r) = \u22121/r. Exact energies,\ngiven by (G.2), reduces to En = \u2212\u03b1n , where \u03b1n is the (n + 1)th zero of the Airy functions Ai.\nA simple approximation of En can be obtained using the expansion (G.4) at the first order\nEn = \u2212\u03b1n \u2248\n\n\u0012\n\n3\u03c0\n2\n\n\u00132/3 \u0012\n\n3\nn+\n4\n\n\u00132/3\n\n\u0012\n\n3\n\u2248 2.811 n +\n4\n\n\u00132/3\n\n.\n\n(3.24)\n\nIt is worth noting that the linear potential is not only a toy model to test the AFM method.\nEffective theories of QCD have proved that it is a good interaction to take into account the\nconfinement of quarks or gluons in potential models of hadronic physics.32), 47), 48)\n3.3.1. AFM with P(r) = \u22121/r\nOne can ask whether it is possible to obtain good approximations for the solutions of\na Schr\u00f6dinger equation with a linear potential by means of hydrogen-like eigenfunctions.\nThis will be examined in this section. Using the previous results for P(r) = \u22121/r, we find\n\u03bd0 = r02 = 22/3 (n + l + 1)4/3 . Exact eigenstates are then approximated by AFM eigenstates\nwhich are, in this case, hydrogen-like states (F.3) with\n\n\u03b7=\n\n\u03bd0 (n + l + 1)4/3\n=\n.\n2\n21/3\n\n(3.25)\n\nSuch states are denoted |Hy; n, li and |Hy; ni = |Hy; n, 0i. Using (F.6) and results above,\nit can be shown that (2.18) is satisfied,\nwithE P(r0 ) = \u22121/r0 = \u22122\u22121/3 (n + l + 1)\u22122/3 . It is\nD \u221a\n\u221a\nHy\nHy\nand \u03b5nHy = \u03b5n,0\nthe\nalso worth noting that (2.19) gives 1/ \u03bd\u0302 = 1/ \u03bd0 . We denote \u03b5n,l\n.\napproximated energies which are given by (3 23) with Q = n+ l + 1. Since \u1e7c (r, \u03bd0 )\u2212V (r) =\n\u2212(r \u2212 r0 )2 /r \u2264 0, \u03b5n,l are lower bounds on the exact energies. This can also be determined\nwith the function g defined by (2.29). In this case, g(y) = \u22121/y with y < 0. The function\ng\u2032\u2032 (y) = \u22122/y3 being positive, g is convex as expected.\nThe quantum number dependence of the scaling parameter \u03b7 corrects partly the difference between the shapes of hrr |n, li and hrr |Hy; n, li. Consequently, hHy; n, l|Hy; n, l \u2032 i = \u03b4ll\u2032\nbecause of the orthogonality of the spherical harmonics, but hHy; n, l|Hy; n\u2032 , li =\n6 \u03b4nn\u2032 . Using\n.\nthe definition (H 1), we find\n\u0012 \u2032\n\u00134/3 !\nn\n+\nl\n+\n1\nHy\nhHy; n, l|Hy; n\u2032 , li = Fn,n\n,\n(3.26)\n\u2032 ,l\nn+l +1\nHy\n\nwith F Hy given by (H.3). Table I gives some values of |hHy; n, l|Hy; n\u2032 , li|2 . We can see\nthat the overlap is not negligible for n close to n\u2032 , but it decreases rapidly with |n \u2212 n\u2032 |. The\nsituation improves when l increases: |hHy; 0, l|Hy; 1, li|2 = 0.43, 0.29, 0.22, 0.18, 0.15, 0.13\nfor l = 0 \u2192 5.\n\n\f18\nTable I. Results for Pn,n\u2032 ,l = |hHy; n, l|Hy; n\u2032 , li|2 . Values for l = 0 (l = 1) are given in the lower-left (upperright) triangle of the Table. Pn,n\u2032 ,l = Pn\u2032 ,n,l and Pn,n,l = 1.\n\nn\u2032\n\n=0\n1\n2\n3\n\nn=0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1\n0.43\n0.055\n0.0097\n\n0.29\n1\n0.43\n0.049\n\n0.028\n0.36\n1\n0.43\n\n0.0039\n0.036\n0.39\n1\n\nIt is interesting to compare \u03b5nHy with (3.24)\n\n\u03b5nHy =\n\n3\n22/3\n\n(n + 1)2/3 \u2248 1.890 (n + 1)2/3 .\n\n(3.27)\n\nThe ratio \u03b5n /En is respectively equal to 0.808, 0.734, 0.712 for n = 0, 1, 2 and tends rapidly\ntoward the asymptotic value 31/3 /\u03c0 2/3 \u2248 0.672. As expected, these ratios are smaller than\n1 since \u03b5nHy are lower bounds. Two wavefunctions are given in Fig. 1. We can see that\nthe differences between exact hrr |ni and AFM hrr |Hy; ni wavefunctions can be large. The\noverlap |hn|Hy; ni|2 between these wavefunctions can be computed numerically with a high\naccuracy. We find respectively the values 0.934, 0.664, 0.298 for n = 0, 1, 2, showing\u0001a rapid\ndecrease of the overlap. It is worth noting that, asymptotically, hrr |ni \u221d exp \u2212 32 r3/2 while\nhrr |Hy; ni is characterized by an exponential tail. Nevertheless, if an observable is not too\nsensitive to the large r behavior, this discrepancy will not spoil its mean value.\nHy\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.2\n0.4\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n-0.2\n0.2\n-0.4\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n-0.6\n\nFig. 1.

Results are summed up in Table II. A direct comparison between the structure of\nexact and AFM observables can be obtained if we remind that the exact ones depend on |\u03b1n |\nwhich can be well approximated by \u03b2n (see (G.4)).

We can verify that E = \u2212\u03b1n \u2265 E(\u03bd0 ) = 22/3\n(n + 1)2/3 and E \u2217 (\u03bd0 ) = 22/3\n(n +\n3\n4\n2/3\n2/3\n\u2217\n1) \u2265 E(\u03bd0 ) = 22/3 (n + 1) .

This is illustrated with some\ntypical results gathered in Table III. Observables are generally not very well reproduced, but\nthis is expected since eigenstates for a linear potential are very different from eigenstates\nfor a Coulomb potential. Actually, the agreement is not catastrophic, except for |\u03c8n,0 (0)|2\nand hp4 i as mentioned above. It is even surprising that the AFM with P(r) = \u22121/r could\ngive energies and some observables for a linear potential with a quite reasonable accuracy.\nMoreover, lower bounds on the energies are obtained.\n\nTable III.

AFM with P(r) = r2\nSince the quadratic potential is closer to the linear potential than a Coulomb one, one\ncan expect better results with harmonic oscillator wavefunctions. This will be examined in\nthis section. Using the previous results for P(r) = r2 , we find \u03bd0 = 1/(2r0 ) = 2\u22124/3 (2n + l +\n3/2)\u22122/3 . Exact eigenstates are then approximated by AFM eigenstates which are, in this\ncase, harmonic oscillator states (E.3) with\n1/4\n\n\u03bb = \u03bd0\n\n= 2\u22121/3 (2n + l + 3/2)\u22121/6 .\n\n(3.30)\n\nSuch states are denoted |HO; n, li and |HO; ni = |HO; n, 0i. Using (E.6) and results above,\nit can be shown that (2.18) is satisfied, with P(r0 ) = r02 = 22/3 (2n + l + 3/2)4/3 . It is also\nworth noting that (2.19) gives 1/\u03bd\u0302 2 = 1/\u03bd02 . This is in agreement with (20) in Ref. 41)\nHO and \u03b5 HO = \u03b5 HO the\n(an auxiliary field \u03c6 = 1/\u03bd is used in this last reference). We denote \u03b5n,l\nn\nn,0\napproximated energies which are given by (3.23) with Q = 2n + l + 3/2. Since \u1e7c (r, \u03bd0 ) \u2212\nHO are upper bounds on the exact energies. In this case, g(y) =\nV (r) = (r \u2212 r0 )2 /(2r0 ) \u2265 0, \u03b5n,l\n\u221a\ny with y > 0. The function g\u2032\u2032 (y) = \u22121/(4y3/2 ) being negative, g is concave as expected.\nSince the scaling parameter \u03bb depends on the quantum numbers, hHO; n, l|HO; n, l \u2032 i =\n6 \u03b4nn\u2032 .\n\u03b4ll\u2032 because of the orthogonality of the spherical harmonics, but hHO; n, l|HO; n\u2032 , li =\n.\nUsing the definition (H 1), we find\n\u0012\n\u00131/6 !\n4n\n+\n2l\n+\n3\nHO\nhHO; n, l|HO; n\u2032 , li = Fn,n\n,\n(3.31)\n\u2032 ,l\n4n\u2032 + 2l + 3\nwith F HO given by (H.4). Table IV gives some values of |hHO; n, l|HO; n\u2032 , li|2 . We can see\nthat the overlap is always small and decreases rapidly with |n \u2212 n\u2032 |. The situation is even\nbetter when l increases: for l = 0 \u2192 5, |hHO; 0, l|HO; 1, li|2 = 0.029, 0.023, 0.019, 0.017,\n0.014, 0.013.\nTable IV.

The ratio \u03b5nHO /En is respectively equal to 1.059, 1.066, 1.067,\nfor n = 0, 1, 2. The asymptotic value 31/3 22/3 /\u03c0 2/3 \u2248 1.067 is rapidly approached. As\nexpected, these ratios are greater than 1 since \u03b5nHO are upper bounds. Two wavefunctions\n\n\f21\nare given in Fig. 1. We can see that the differences between exact hrr |ni and AFM hrr |HO; ni\nwavefunctions are quite small. The overlap |hn|HO; ni|2 between these wavefunctions can\nbe computed numerically with a high accuracy. We find respectively the values 0.997, 0.979,\n0.951 for n = 0, 1, 2. A value below 0.75 is reached for n = 6 and below 0.25 for n = 14. A\nwavefunction hrr |HO;\u0001ni is characterized by an Gaussian tail, while we have asymptotically\nhrr |ni \u221d exp \u2212 23 r3/2 . Again, if an observable is not too sensitive to the large r behavior,\nthis discrepancy will not spoil its mean value.\nThe various observables |\u03c8n,0 (0)|2 , hrk i and hpk i computed with the AFM states can\nbe obtained using formulae (E.4), (E.6) and (E.7) for l = 0 with the parameter \u03bb given by\n(3.30). Results are summed up in Table V. Again, a direct comparison between the structure\nof exact and AFM observables can be obtained by using \u03b2n (see (G.4)) instead of |\u03b1n |. Let\nus look in detail only at the mean value hr2 i. For the exact and AFM solutions, we have\nrespectively\n8|\u03b1n |2 25/3 31/3 \u03c0 4/3\n\u2248\nhn|r |ni =\n15\n5\n\u0012\n\u00134/3\n3\n.\nhHO; n|r2 |HO; ni = 4 n +\n4\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n3\nn+\n4\n\n\u00134/3\n\n\u0012\n\n3\n\u2248 4.214 n +\n4\n\n\u00134/3\n\n, (3.33)\n(3.34)\n\nIn contrast with the previous case, all observables are very well reproduced. This is also\nthe case for n \u226b 1, while the overlap |hn|HO; ni|2 tends towards very small values in this\nlimit. This is due to the fact that some observables are not very sensitive to the details of the\nwavefunctions and that the sizes of exact and AFM states stay similar.\nTable V.

Agreement between AFM and exact results are\n\n\f22\nvery good, much better than for the previous case. This is expected, since eigenstates for\na quadratic potential are closer to eigenstates for a linear potential than eigenstates for a\nCoulomb potential. The quantum number dependence of the scaling parameter \u03bb corrects,\nmuch better than \u03b7 , the difference between the shapes of AFM and exact eigenstates.\nTable VI.

General considerations\nWithin the auxiliary field method, if the problem studied is analytically manageable, an\neigenstate can then be determined with the same computational effort for any set of quantum numbers (n, l). So this method is very useful if one is interested in obtaining analytical\ninformation about the whole spectra, wavefunctions, and observables of a Hamiltonian without necessarily searching a very high accuracy. The selection of the potential P(r) seems\ncrucial to obtain good results for the eigenstates. For a linear potential, P(r) = r2 is clearly\nthe best choice. In Ref. 53), it is shown that P(r) = \u22121/r provides much better results\nfor an exponential potential, while the choice of P(r) is not so crucial for the logarithmic\ninteraction.\nAn eigenvalue equation can also be solved within the variational method by expanding\ntrial states in terms of special basis states. The correct asymptotic tail can be well reproduced if the basis states are well chosen. With this method, a matrix representation of the\nHamiltonian is obtained and the solutions are computed by diagonalizing this matrix: M upper bounds on the energies are determined with the corresponding M states, where M is the\norder of the matrix. A very good accuracy is possible if M is large enough. Even for M = 1,\nthe accuracy can be better than the one provided by the AFM (see Sect. 6.4.3). However, if\none is interested in closed-form results, the matrix elements must have an analytical expression and the number of computed states M must be limited to 4. But even for M = 2, the\neigenvalues can have very complicated expression, not usable in practice. So, the variational\nmethod can only provide, at best, a very limited number of eigenvalues and eigenstates with\nan analytical form.\nThe WKB method is also a popular method to solve eigenvalue equations.7), 10), 11) In\nprinciple, it is only valid for high values of the radial quantum number n, but it can sometimes yield very good results for low-lying states.56) Wavefunctions are not necessary to\ncompute some observables56) but they can be determined for arbitrary value of n with this\n\n\f23\nmethod. An advantage is that their asymptotic behavior can be correct but, unfortunately,\nthe WKB method is mainly manageable for S-states. Indeed, for l 6= 0, the interaction V (r)\nmust be supplemented by the centrifugal potential, which complicates greatly the integrals\nto compute. Moreover, these wavefunctions are piecewise-defined whose different parts\nmust be connected properly at the turning points. So they are not very practical to use.\n3.4. Improving the eigenenergies\n3.4.1. Modifications of the principal quantum number\nWe have a priori no idea of the dependence of the exact result \u03b5 (\u03bb ; n, l) on the parameter \u03bb and on the quantum numbers (n, l). The AFM gives approximate answers: (3.10) or\n(3.19). Moreover, a simple glance at both formulae convinces us that they have the same\ndependence in \u03bb , but they differ in the dependence on (n, l) only through a different expression for the principal quantum number Q which is a remnant of the function P(r) used in\nthe AFM.\nOwing to the fact that AFM gives the exact result for \u03bb = \u22121 and \u03bb = 2, a continuity\nargument suggests that the exact result should not be too different from the previous formulae, but with a modified expression for the principal quantum number. Thus we propose for\nthe eigenvalues of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with power-law potential (3.3) the following\nprescription\n2\n2\u03bb\n\u03bb\n2+\u03bb\n\u03b5AFM (\u03bb ; n, l) =\n|\u03bb | 2+\u03bb 2\u2212 2+\u03bb Q(\u03bb ; n, l) 2+\u03bb .\n(3.35)\n2\u03bb\nThe choice of the function Q(\u03bb ; n, l) is just a matter of guess but we require that it is a\ncontinuous function of \u03bb and that it coincides with QC (n, l) for \u03bb = \u22121 and with QHO (n, l)\nfor \u03bb = 2. Besides, there is some freedom. Asymptotically for large l, both QC and QHO\nare proportional to l with a slope equal to unity. Owing to the fact that QC and QHO lead to\nlower and upper bounds, a unity slope is maintained asymptotically whatever the value of \u03bb .\nAsymptotically for large n, both QC and QHO are proportional to n and we maintain also this\ncharacteristic behavior for other values of \u03bb . In this work we propose two forms of Q(\u03bb ; n, l)\nwhich improve largely the results as compared to the QC and QHO values. Although in a\ncontext slightly different, R.L. Hall has considered an improvement of the results based on\na function Pn,l (\u03bb ) which was shown as monotone increasing. His prescription to improve\nthe results (see Ref. 57)) was different from ours, but the spirit is the same.\nThe first prescription depends on two free functions b, g and is chosen as\nQs (\u03bb ; n, l) = b(\u03bb )n + l + g(\u03bb ).\n\n(3.36)\n\nThe preceding conditions impose b(2) = 2, g(2) = 3/2 and b(\u22121) = 1 = g(\u22121). The simple\nform Qs is linear (it is called sometimes the \"linear approximation\") both in n and l and,\nthus, looks as simple as QC and QHO but allows much better results, as will be shown below.\nThe reader may use it if he needs a simple formulation giving an average relative precision\nof order of 10\u22122 .\nThe second prescription depends on five free functions a, c, d, e, f and reads\nQq (\u03bb ; n, l) =\n\na(\u03bb )n2 + l 2 + c(\u03bb )nl + d(\u03bb )n + e(\u03bb )l + f (\u03bb )\n.\nn+l +1\n\n(3.37)\n\n\f24\nThe boundary conditions are in this case (a, c, d, e, f )(\u03bb = 2) = (2, 3, 7/2, 5/2, 3/2) and\n(a, c, d, e, f )(\u03bb = \u22121) = (1, 2, 2, 2, 1). The form Qq is a rational fraction with a quadratic\nnumerator (it is called sometimes the \"quadratic approximation\"). This form is more sophisticated that Qs but it gives results with a very high accuracy of order of 10\u22124 . Some\nexamples are given in the next section. Other forms have been tested but formulae (3.36)\nand (3.37) appeared very convenient. Contrary to the case Q = QHO , for which \u03b5AFM is a\nupper bound and the case Q = QC for which it is a lower bound, we have no certainty concerning the position of the AFM energy as compared to the exact energy in the cases Q = Qs\nor Q = Qq ; but in any case, we will show that the approximate value is always very close to\nthe exact value.\nExcept the very special case of the linear potential, which is studied in detail above,\nno analytical expression for the exact energy \u03b5 (\u03bb ; n, l) exists (even in S-state) for potentials\nwith \u03bb 6= \u22121 or 2. Therefore to compare our AFM results to the exact ones, one needs\nvery accurate eigenvalues \u03b5num (\u03bb ; n, l) of Hamiltonian (3.3). For that purpose, we rely on\na very efficient method, called the Lagrange mesh method.54) Without difficulty, one can\nget an accuracy of 10\u22128 much higher than what could be expected from AFM. Thus, in the\nfollowing, we identify fully the exact value \u03b5 and the numerical value \u03b5num .\nThe ultimate aim is to determine the approximate AFM energies \u03b5AFM that stick as close\nas possible to the exact values. Two kinds of approximations, denoted generically (a), are\n(a)\nconsidered; in both of them \u03b5AFM is given by (3.35) but in the linear approximation ((a) =\ns) the principal quantum number is given by (3.36) while in the quadratic approximation\n((a) = q) this number results from (3.37). The free parameters of each approximation are\ndenoted \u03c3 (\u03bb ). There are two of them \u03c3 = (b, g) for the linear approximation and five of\nthem \u03c3 = (a, c, d, e, f ) for the quadratic approximation.\n3.4.2. Comparisons to numerical results\nWe now search for an analytical formula giving \u03c3 (\u03bb ). In order to do that, we proceed\nin the following way. In a first step, we choose a sample {\u03bb1 = \u22121, \u03bb2 , . . . , \u03bb p = 2} of\np values of \u03bb in the considered domain \u22121 \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 2. We found that p = 10 is a good\ncompromise between the researched quality and the numerical effort. For each value \u03bbi\nbelonging to the sample, we calculate, using the Lagrange mesh method,54) an array of\n\"exact\" eigenvalues \u03b5 (\u03bbi ; n, l) for nmax + 1 values of the radial quantum number n (n =\n0, . . . , nmax ) and for lmax + 1 values of the orbital quantum number l (l = 0, . . . , lmax ). For the\nprecise study that we want, it is enough to choose nmax = 8 and lmax = 5. The AFM results\ndepend on the free parameters \u03c3 (\u03bbi ) = \u03c3i . The game is to find the values of \u03c3i which make\nthe AFM energies the closest to the exact ones.\nA tool to do that consists in the minimization of the chi-square quantity\n\n\u03c7 (\u03c3i ) =\n\nnmax lmax\n1\n\u2211 \u2211 (\u03b5 (\u03bbi; n, l) \u2212 \u03b5AFM (\u03c3i ; n, l))2 .\n(nmax + 1)(lmax + 1) n=0\nl=0\n\n(3.38)\n\nOther choices are possible but we find this one very convenient. In some very specific\nsituations, this function may lead to bad results and we find convenient to introduce an\n\n\f25\nalternative minimization based on the difference quantity\n\n\u2206 (\u03c3i ) =\n\nnmax lmax\n1\n\u2211 \u2211 |\u03b5 (\u03bbi; n, l) \u2212 \u03b5AFM (\u03c3i ; n, l)| .\n(nmax + 1)(lmax + 1) n=0\nl=0\n\n(3.39)\n\nThe minimization of one of these functions provides the values \u03c3i which will be denoted\n\u03c3num (\u03bbi ) because they rely on a numerical prescription. Generally the chi-square and the\ndifference procedures give very similar results, but sometimes a glance at the results may\nlead us to favor one against the other. Of course for \u03bb = \u22121 and \u03bb = 2, we know that the\nvalues \u03c3num (\u03bbi ) given by the values discussed earlier lead to the exact results so that the\nminimization procedure is useless and both \u03c7 (\u03c3i ) and \u2206 (\u03c3i ) vanish. Over the full range of\n\u03bb sample (10 values), we found that the maximal value of the chi-square is 4.4 10\u22124 and\n2.2 10\u22127 for the linear and quadratic approximations respectively, while the accuracy given\nby \u2206 is 1.33% and 0.07% respectively. Thus, one sees that the very simple prescription\n(a) = s gives already a relative accuracy of the order of 10\u22122 over the whole spectrum\n(54 values), while the more sophisticated prescription (a) = q gives practically the exact\nresults. Several formulae exist in literature for approximate values of \u03b5 (\u03bb ; n, l) resulting\nfrom various techniques. Among them, one of the most precise is reported in Ref. 51) with\nthe use of a WKB approach. It must be stressed that our method, even in its crudest version,\nlooks much simpler and gives much better results. Thus, we are confident that our formulae\nare really an improvement compared to the previous existing ones.\nThe second step of our study is now the guess of continuous functions \u03c3 (\u03bb ) which\nstick as much as possible to the values \u03c3num (\u03bbi ) for the particular values \u03bb = \u03bbi . The choice\nis huge because we have freedom on the form of the function, and then on the parameters\nentering it. Since we research simplicity above all, we find that an hyperbola form for all\nthe parameters is very well suited. The fit of the 3 parameters entering the definition of an\nhyperbola is done using again a chi-square function \u03c7 \u2032 based on the numerical value \u03c3i and\nthe proposed value \u03c3 (\u03bbi ).\nWe summarize below the definite choice for the various parameters. For the linear\napproximation (3.36), one gets\nb(\u03bb ) =\n\n41\u03bb + 86\n,\n13\u03bb + 58\n\ng(\u03bb ) =\n\n5\u03bb + 17\n.\n2\u03bb + 14\n\n(3.40)\n\nFor the quadratic approximation (3.37), the corresponding functions look like\n43\u03bb + 82\n171\u03bb + 675\n136\u03bb + 330\n, c(\u03bb ) =\n, d(\u03bb ) =\n,\n15\u03bb + 54\n29\u03bb + 281\n25\u03bb + 122\n109\u03bb + 517\n225\u03bb + 729\ne(\u03bb ) =\n, f (\u03bb ) =\n.\n30\u03bb + 234\n94\u03bb + 598\na(\u03bb ) =\n\n(3.41)\n\nOne verifies that for \u03bb = \u22121, 2 the exact values are recovered. We choose to use integer\nnumbers below 1000 in order to match at best the real numbers yielded by the minimization\nprocedure.\nAs a matter of test, we present in detail the special case of the linear potential (\u03bb = 1)\nstudied in Sect. 3.3. \u03b5 (1; n, 0) is then just proportional to the opposite of the (n + 1)th\nzero of the Airy function. An asymptotic solution of Hamiltonian (3.3) valid for large n\n\n\f26\n\u221a\n.\n.\n.\nis\n\u221a given by (3 24). Equating (3 24) and (3 36), we find b(1) = \u03c0 / 3 \u2248 1.814 and g(1) =\n3\u03c0 /4 \u2248 1.360. These values are the exact ones to describe the spectrum for l = 0 and\nlarge n, but not necessarily for l 6= 0 or low n values. However the values coming from our\nfit (3.40) are b(1) = 127/71 \u2248 1.789 and g(1) = 22/16 = 1.375, very close to these new\nvalues. Assuming that this procedure can be extended for any values of l, the hyperbola can\nbe determined completely by using the exact values b(\u22121) = 1, g(\u22121) = 1, b(2) = 2, and\ng(2) = 3/2. The coefficients are then given by\n\u221a\nz = 3\u03c0 ,\n(4z \u2212 18)\u03bb + (18 \u2212 2z)\nb(\u03bb ) =\n,\n(3z \u2212 15)\u03bb + (21 \u2212 3z)\n(7z \u2212 36)\u03bb + (36 \u2212 5z)\n.\n(3.42)\ng(\u03bb ) =\n(6z \u2212 32)\u03bb + (40 \u2212 6z)\nThese relations could look quite complicated but it is worth noting the symmetries existing\nbetween the absolute values of the numbers present in the formula. When a number appears\ntwice in a coefficient of the numerator (denominator), it is the arithmetic mean of two other\ncorresponding numbers in the denominator (numerator). A number which appears twice in\ng(\u03bb ) is the double than the corresponding number in b(\u03bb ).\n\nFig. 2. Coefficients b(\u03bb ) and g(\u03bb ) from (3.36) as a function of \u03bb , obtained from various approximations:\nnumerical fit minimizing the function \u03c7 (solid line), hyperbolae from (3.42) (short-dashed line), hyperbolae\nfrom (3.40) (dashed-dotted line). These last curves are nearly indistinguishable from the solid lines.\n\nIn Fig. 2, we give an idea of how good is the fit of \u03c3 (\u03bb ) with hyperbolae. We show\nonly the plots for the functions b(\u03bb ) and g(\u03bb ) for the linear approximation. The results look\nsimilar for the functions \u03c3 (\u03bb ) of the quadratic approximation. The solid lines represent the\nnumerical values \u03c3num (\u03bbi ) obtained by a chi-square procedure; in a sense they are the best\nthat we can find. The short-dashed line represent an hyperbola determined analytically; the\ncorresponding functions are given by (3.42). The dashed-dotted line represents the hyperbola which sticks as close as possible to the numerical curve; the corresponding functions\nare given by (3.40). This last prescription appears to be very good.\nIn Table VII, we present the lower part of the spectrum (nmax = lmax = 3) obtained\nfor different types of approximations and compare the various results to the exact ones.

For each set (n, l), the first line (bold case)\nis the exact result obtained by numerical integration, the other lines are obtained with the AFM approximation (3.35). For the principal quantum number Q(1; n, l), the second line uses the prescription (3.42),\nthe third line the prescription (3.36) with (3.40) (linear approximation), and the fourth line the prescription (3.37) with (3.41) (quadratic approximation).\n\nl\n\n\u03b5 (1; 0, l)\n\n\u03b5 (1; 1, l)\n\n\u03b5 (1; 2, l)\n\n\u03b5 (1; 3, l)\n\n0\n\n1.47292\n1.46167\n1.47214\n1.47310\n2.11746\n2.11057\n2.11929\n2.11743\n2.67619\n2.67098\n2.67874\n2.67630\n3.18188\n3.17757\n3.18469\n3.18209\n\n2.57525\n2.57138\n2.56575\n2.57544\n3.07701\n3.08645\n3.08132\n3.07666\n3.54649\n3.56156\n3.55678\n3.54615\n3.98898\n4.00682\n4.00231\n3.98873\n\n3.47773\n3.47560\n3.45909\n3.47766\n3.91056\n3.92585\n3.91032\n3.91021\n4.32712\n4.35159\n4.33684\n4.32670\n4.72763\n4.75742\n4.74332\n4.72722\n\n4.27536\n4.27394\n4.24854\n4.27508\n4.66528\n4.68320\n4.65894\n4.66500\n5.04580\n5.07529\n5.05198\n5.04544\n5.41584\n5.45277\n5.43029\n5.41545\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nis clear that all the considered approximations give very good results. As expected, the\napproximation with (3.42) is very good for l = 0 and large n values, but it becomes worse\nand worse (although not so bad) as l increases. The linear approximation (3.36) is very\ngood everywhere and should be considered as a good compromise between simplicity and\naccuracy while the quadratic approximation is really excellent everywhere and must be used\nif we want analytical accurate expression of the exact energies.\nOther approximate forms for the eigenvalues of Hamiltonian (3.3) exist and give good\nresults,49), 58) but they are not considered here because they do not give the exact result for\nthe cases \u03bb = \u22121 and \u03bb = 2.\nObviously the functions \u03c3 (\u03bb ) depend on the points used for the fit but also on the particular choice of the functions \u03c7 and \u2206 . Other definitions\u2013relative error instead of absolute\nerror or different summations on quantum numbers\u2013would have given other numbers. Nevertheless, the quality of the results tends to prove that they are very close to the best possible\nones.\n\u00a74. Schr\u00f6dinger equation with an arbitrary potential\n\n4.1. Scaling laws\nLet E(m, G, a) be the eigenvalues of a Schr\u00f6dinger equation corresponding to a system\nof reduced mass m subject to a potential of intensity G and characteristic inverse length a.\n\n\f28\nThe scaling law gives the relationship between E(m, G, a) and E(m\u2032 , G\u2032 , a\u2032 ). Let us start\nfrom the corresponding Schr\u00f6dinger equations\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n(4.1)\n\u2212 \u2206r + GV (ar) \u2212 E(m, G, a) \u03a8 (rr ) = 0,\n2m\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032 \u2032\n\u2212 \u2032 \u2206r + G V (a r) \u2212 E(m , G , a ) \u03a8 \u2032 (rr ) = 0.\n(4.2)\n2m\nThe important point is that it is the same function V (x) which appears in both equations. In\n(4.2), let us make the change of variables r = \u03b1 x and multiply it by \u03c7 . Now, we choose the\narbitrary parameters \u03b1 and \u03c7 in order to fulfill the conditions \u03c7 /(m\u2032 \u03b1 2 ) = 1/m and \u03b1 a\u2032 = a.\nIn other words, we impose the following values\na\nm\u2032 \u0010 a \u0011 2\n\u03b1 = \u2032, \u03c7 =\n.\n(4.3)\na\nm a\u2032\nWith these values, (4.2) can be recast into the form\n\u0015 \u0010 \u0011\n\u0014\n\u2032 \u0010 a \u00112\na\nm\u2032 \u0010 a \u00112\n1\n\u2032\n\u2032 \u2032\n\u2032m\n(4.4)\nV (ax) \u2212\nE(m , G , a ) \u03a8 \u2032 \u2032 x = 0.\n\u2212 \u2206x + G\n\u2032\n\u2032\n2m\nm a\nm a\na\n\nEquation (4.1) can be recovered, provided one makes the identification G =\nG\u2032 (m\u2032 /m)(a/a\u2032 )2 and a similar relation for the energies.\nThe scaling law is thus expressed in its most general form as\n\u0012 \u2032 \u00132 !\nm\u2032 \u0010 a \u0011 2\na\nm\nE(m, G, a) =\n(4.5)\n, a\u2032 .\nE m\u2032 , G\u2032 = G \u2032\n\u2032\nm a\nm a\n\nIn fact, it is always possible to define the function V (x) so that a\u2032 = 1 (for example in\ndefining a new position operator as a\u2032 r). In what follows, and without loss of generality, we\nwill apply the scaling law for energies under the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\nmG\nm\u2032 a2\n\u2032\n\u2032\nE m ,G = \u2032 2 ,1 .\n(4.6)\nE(m, G, a) =\nm\nma\nThis equality is very powerful since it is valid for the eigenvalues of a nonrelativistic\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation with an arbitrary central potential. It allows to express the energy\nin terms of a dimensionless quantity and some dimensioned factors, as we will see below.\nMoreover it is possible to give to the mass m\u2032 any particular convenient value (for example\nm\u2032 = 1) so that E(m, G, a) is expressed through the energies of a very simple reduced equation depending on a single parameter G\u2032 . Instead, one can choose to impose a given value\nof the intensity G\u2032 (for example G\u2032 = 1) so that E(m, G, a) is expressed through the energies\nof a very simple reduced equation depending on a single parameter m\u2032 .\nTo summarize the previous discussion, the scaling laws are very powerful since they\nallow to express the most general form of the energy E(m, G, a) in terms of the eigenvalues\nof a reduced equation in which two parameters among the three available can be set at a\ngiven fixed value. The chosen parameters as well as their values are determined in the most\nconvenient way.\n\n\f29\n4.2. General formulae for energies and mean radius\nIn Sect. 3, we remarked that, using either P(r) = r2 or P(r) = \u22121/r, we obtain, for\npower-law potentials, AFM energies which have exactly the same form but differ only by the\nexpression of the principal quantum number Q. In other words, this means that \u03b5AFM (\u03bb ; n, l)\nappears always in the form F(\u03bb ; Q(n, l)) with a universal form of the function F. The only\ndifference is that, in F, we must use QHO (n, l) for P(r) = r2 and QC (n, l) for P(r) = \u22121/r.\nThis is obvious from the comparison of (3.10) and (3.19) (or even from (3.12) and (3.21)).\nThis property allowed us to modify the expression of this number Q in order to improve drastically the quality of the results. This universal property seems also valid for the\nexpression of the mean radius, as you can see from (3.9) and (3.18) (or even for (3.11) and\n(3.20)).\nWe will show in this part that these invariance properties are even more general and are\nvalid not only for a power-law potential but whatever the potential V (r) to be used.40) This\nproperty is even stronger since it persists for any power-law type for the starting function\nP(r) and not only for a quadratic or Coulomb form. Let us demonstrate this fundamental\nproperty.\nFor beginning, let us recall that the AFM energies for the Hamiltonian (3.1) are given\nby (see (3.2) and (3.35))\n2\n2+\u03bb\nEAFM (m, a, \u03bb ; n, l) =\n(a|\u03bb |) \u03bb +2\n2\u03bb\n\n\u0012\n\nQ(\u03bb ; n, l)2\nm\n\n\u0013 \u03bb \u03bb+2\n\n.\n\n(4.7)\n\nIf we ask that EAFM (m, a, \u03bb ; n, l) = E(m, a, \u03bb ; n, l), we can consider that this formula gives\nthe definition of the principal quantum number Q(\u03bb ; n, l) for all power-law potentials. The\nexact form is known only in a limited number of cases. Obviously, Q(\u22121; n, l) = n + l + 1\nand Q(2; n, l) = 2n + l + 3/2. Using the notations of Appendix G, we can write\n\u221a\n\u0010 \u03b1 \u00113/2\n\u03c0\n3\nn\n\u2248 \u221a n+\nQ(1; n, 0) = 2 \u2212\n\u03c0.\n(4.8)\n3\n4\n3\n\nIn the other cases, we showed that (4.7) was able to give the results with a relative accuracy\nbetter than 10\u22124 if a good choice is made for the value of Q. Following the philosophy of\nSect. 2.5, we consider that expression (4.7) represents the exact expression of our problem\nand pursue the general AFM method with the starting function P(r) = P(\u03bb ) (r) = sgn(\u03bb )r\u03bb .\nIn this case, K(r) = V \u2032 (r)r1\u2212\u03bb /|\u03bb | and the extremization condition (2.24) leads to the\ntranscendental equation\nQ(\u03bb ; n, l)2\nr0\u03bb +2 K(r0 ) =\n.\n(4.9)\nm|\u03bb |\n\nIt seems that r0 is really \u03bb -dependent, but replacing K(r) by its expression in terms of the\npotential, this equation turns out to be\nr03V \u2032 (r0 ) =\n\nQ(\u03bb ; n, l)2\n.\nm\n\n(4.10)\n\nFor a given potential, the inverse function D(x),\nD(x3V \u2032 (x)) = x or\n\nD(x)3V \u2032 (D(x)) = x,\n\n(4.11)\n\n\f30\nis obviously universal and one has r0 = D(Q2 /m).\nThe value of the AFM energy follows from (2.25) and reads\nEAFM =\n\nQ(\u03bb ; n, l)2\n+V (r0 ).\n2mr02\n\n(4.12)\n\nF (x) =\n\nx\n+V (D(x))\n2D(x)2\n\n(4.13)\n\nThus the function\nis also universal and one has\n\nEAFM = F (Q2 /m).\n\n(4.14)\n\nSince it is always possible to choose the same mass for the genuine Schr\u00f6dinger equation with V (r) and the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with the AFM potential P(\u03bb ) (r), the previous\ndemonstration shows that both the mean radius and the eigenenergy depends on \u03bb through\nthe principal quantum number Q(\u03bb ; n, l) only.\nWe end up with the very important conclusion that can be stated as a theorem (expressed\nbelow for the energy but also valid for the mean radius)\nIf, in the expression E(Q(\u03bb ; n, l)) of the approximate energies resulting from the\nAFM with P(\u03bb ) (r), one makes the substitution Q(\u03bb ; n, l) \u2192 Q(\u03b7 ; n, l) (so that\nE(Q(\u03bb ; n, l)) \u2192 E(Q(\u03b7 ; n, l)) with the same functional form for E), one obtains\nthe approximate eigenenergies resulting from the AFM with P(\u03b7 ) (r).\nIn a sense, as long as we use a power-law potential P(\u03bb ) (r) as starting potential, there is\na universality of the approximate AFM expression of the eigenvalue, depending only on\nthe potential V (r). The only remainder of the particular chosen potential P(\u03bb ) (r) is the\nexpression of Q(\u03bb ; n, l), as given by (3.36) for instance. This result holds whatever the form\nchosen for the potential V (r), even if we are unable to obtain analytical expressions for the\nAFM approximation.\nThis property was first remarked for the particular case of a power-law potential V (r) =\nr\u03bb switching from the harmonic oscillator (\u03bb = 2) to the Coulomb potential (\u03bb = \u22121). We\nproved here that it is in fact totally general. It is probably related to a well-known property\nin classical mechanics: one can pass from the motion of a harmonic oscillator to the Kepler\nmotion by a canonical transformation. This universality property will be used extensively\nin the following applications; it allows us to choose the form P(\u03bb ) (r) which is the most\nconvenient for our particular situation. Nevertheless, the existence of possible lower or\nupper bounds can only be guaranteed for \u03bb = \u22121 and 2, since formula (4.7) is exact only in\nthese cases.\nBy rewriting (4.10) and recalling that the kinetic energy is denoted by T (pp) with T (x) =\n2\nx\n2m , the AFM formula for the energies can be written into the form\nEAFM = T (p0 ) +V (r0 ),\nQ\np0 = ,\nr0\np0 T \u2032 (p0 ) = r0V \u2032 (r0 ),\n\n(4.15)\n(4.16)\n(4.17)\n\nwhere Q stands for Q(\u03bb ; n, l) to lighten the notations and to stress that we have some freedom\nin the choice of this quantity. Equation (4.16) defines a \"mean impulsion\" p0 from the\n\n\f31\nmean radius r0 resulting from (4.10). Looking at equation (4.17), one can recognize the\ngeneral form of the virial theorem.59) Finally, (4.15) gives the energy as a sum of the kinetic\nenergy evaluated at the mean impulsion p0 and the potential energy evaluated at the mean\nradius r0 . This makes clearly appear the physical content of the AFM approximation. Let\nus point out that p0 is not a linear function of Q, as suggested by (4.16), since r0 has a\ncomplicated dependence on Q through (4.17). The approximate eigenstate |\u03bd0 i is a solution\nof h(\u03bd0 ) = p 2 /(2m) + sgn(\u03bb )\u03bd0 r\u03bb and has a characteristic size depending on m\u03bd0 = mK(r0 )\n(see (E.3), (F.3) and (G.3)). This quantity can be easily computed once (4.17) is solved.\nThe virial theorem applied to Hamiltonian H\u0303(\u03bd0 ), given by (3.1) with a \u2192 \u03bd0 , implies\nthat\n\u001c\n\u001d D\nE\np2\n(4.18)\n\u03bd0\n\u03bd0 = \u03bd0 \u03bd0 |\u03bb |r\u03bb \u03bd0 ,\nm\nwith \u03bd0 = K(r0 ) given by (4.9). The use of definition (4.16) with property (2.18) gives\n+\n\u001d *\n\u001c\nr\u03bb\np2\n(4.19)\n\u03bd0 2 \u03bd0 = \u03bd0 \u03bb \u03bd0 = 1.\np0\nr0\n\nThe last equality is another way to write the fundamental property (2.18). These equations,\nas well as the boundary character of the solution, are only applicable when the exact form\nQ(\u03bb ; n, l) is used. In practice, this occurs when \u03bb = \u22121 or 2, or \u03bb = 1 for S-states only.\nNevertheless, a better accuracy can be obtained by an appropriate choice of Q as shown in\nSect. 3.4.\nIn the rest of this section, several interactions will be studied with the AFM. Approximations for all states in the spectrum will be given. When the potential allows only a finite\nnumber of bound states, formulae for corresponding critical constants will be also presented.\n4.3. Square root potentials\nThe square root potential that we study in this section is fundamental for the understanding of hybrid mesons, which are exotic mesons actively researched nowadays. Indeed,\nthere are two possible descriptions of hybrid mesons within constituent models:\n\u2022 First, a genuine three-body object made of a quark, an antiquark and a constituent\ngluon.\n\u2022 Second, a two-body object made of a quark and an antiquark in the potential due to the\ngluon field in an excited state.\nIt has been shown that these two pictures of the same object are, to a large extent, equivalent.60), 61), 62) In this part, we focus only on the second aspect of the description.\nIn general, the string energy, and, therefore, the potential energy between the static\nquark and antiquark in the excited gluon field is given by63), 64)\np\nV (r) = a2 r2 + b2 ,\n(4.20)\nwhere a is the usual string tension while b2 = 2\u03c0 aK + C is a term exhibiting the string\nexcitation number K and a constant C. These values depend on the model adopted: a pure\nstring theory63) or a more phenomenological approach.62), 64) For the study of heavy hybrid\nmesons, it is therefore very interesting to calculate the eigenenergies of the Schr\u00f6dinger\n\n\f32\nequation governed by the Hamiltonian\nH=\n\np2 p 2 2\n+ a r + b2 ,\n2m\n\n(4.21)\n\nwhere m is the reduced mass and where the parameters a and b depend on the model adopted,\nwhich must be confronted to experimental results ultimately.\nIn this section we give an analytical approximate expression for the eigenvalues of\nHamiltonian (4.21). In Ref. 65), those results have been exploited to study the mass of a\nheavy hybrid meson in the picture of an excited color field. With this mass formula, it was\npossible to predict the general behavior of the mass spectrum as a function of the quantum\nnumbers of the system and search for possible towers of states. These results can then be\nused as a guide for experimentalists.\n4.3.1. Expression of the energies\nUsing scaling laws (4.6), dimensionless variables \u03b5 and \u03b2 can be defined so that the\ngeneral energy E(m, a, b) is easily calculated\nE(m, a, b) =\n\n\u0012\n\n2a2\nm\n\n\u00131/3\n\n\u03b5 (\u03b2 ),\n\nwith \u03b2 = b2\n\n\u0010 m \u00112/3\n.\n2a2\n\n(4.22)\n\n\u03b5 (\u03b2 ) is an eigenvalue of the dimensionless reduced Hamiltonian\nh=\n\np2 p 2\n+ r + \u03b2.\n4\n\n(4.23)\n\nLet us apply the AFM in order to find approximate expressions for the eigenvalues of\nthe Hamiltonian (4.23). Equation (4.10) gives immediately\n4r08 \u2212 Q4 r02 \u2212 \u03b2 Q4 = 0.\n\n(4.24)\n\nA simple change of variable x = 2r02 /Q4/3 plus the definition of the parameter\nY=\n\n16\u03b2\n3Q4/3\n\n(4.25)\n\nallows to transform the transcendental equation in the fourth order reduced equation 4x4 \u2212\n8x \u2212 3Y = 0 whose solution is given in terms of the G\u2212 function discussed in Sect. B.2. This\nallows the determination of \u03b5AFM by (4.12).\nr \u0014\n\u0015\n1\n\u03b2\n2\n\u03b5AFM (\u03b2 ; n, l) = 2\nG\u2212 (Y ) +\n,\n(4.26)\n3Y\nG\u2212 (Y )\nwith Y = Y (\u03b2 ; n, l) given by (4.25). The problem is entirely solved.\nEquation (4.26) is complicated but quite accurate. In order to get a better insight into\nthis formula, it is interesting to calculate the limits when Y \u226b 1 and Y \u226a 1 because they\nallow an easier comparison with experimental data. This technical point was treated in\nRef. 65).\n\n\f33\n4.3.2. Comparisons to numerical results\nAs we discussed in Sect. 4.2, it is possible to improve drastically the results given\nby (4.26) if, instead of using the natural forms Q = QHO or Q = QC , we switch to a more\nconvenient expression. The only relevant dynamical parameter in this case being \u03b2 , it is\nnatural to propose an expression depending on this parameter: Q(\u03b2 ; n, l). For power-law\npotentials we proposed a \"linear\" (in terms of n, l) approximation Qs and a \"quadratic\"\napproximation Qq . For our special potential, one can adopt the same prescriptions, or choose\na new better one, if one wishes. Since our aim is not to obtain the most accurate possible\nanalytic expressions at the price of complicated formulae, but rather to show that the AFM\nis able to give already very good results even with very simple expressions, we adopt here a\nlinear expression, so that we choose Q(\u03b2 ; n, l) under the form\nQ(\u03b2 ; n, l) = A(\u03b2 )n + l +C(\u03b2 ).\n\n(4.27)\n\nWe allow the \u03b2 value to vary between \u03b2 = 0 for which the potential is purely linear and\n\u03b2 = \u221e for which it is harmonic. We are again in a situation for which Q = QHO gives an\nupper bound while Q = QC provides a lower bound.\nThe procedure used is similar to the one presented in Sect. 3.4 and is described in detail\nin Ref. 65). In order to obtain functions which are as simple as possible, continuous in \u03b2 ,\nand which reproduce at best the exact values, we choose hyperbolic forms for A(\u03b2 ) and\nC(\u03b2 ). Explicitly, we find\nA(\u03b2 ) =\n\n8\u03b2 + 102\n,\n4\u03b2 + 57\n\nC(\u03b2 ) =\n\n30\u03b2 + 53\n.\n20\u03b2 + 39\n\n(4.28)\n\nThe integers appearing in A and C are rounded numbers whose magnitude is chosen in\norder to not exceed too much 100. The A and C functions have been constrained to exhibit\nthe right behavior A \u2192 2 and C \u2192 3/2 for very large values of \u03b2 . formulae (4.28) give\nA(0)\n\u221a = 102/57 \u2248 1.789 and\n\u221a C(0) = 53/39 \u2248 1.359. These values are such that A(0) \u2248\n\u03c0 / 3 \u2248 1.814 and C(0) \u2248 3\u03c0 /4 \u2248 1.360, as expected from the results of a nonrelativistic\nlinear potential.\nOur results are exact for \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e, and the error is maximal for small values of \u03b2 . But,\nover the whole range of \u03b2 values, the results given by our analytical expression can be\nconsidered as excellent. Just to exhibit a quantitative comparison, we report in Table VIII the\nexact \u03b5 (\u03b2 ; n, l) and approximate \u03b5AFM (\u03b2 ; n, l) values obtained for \u03b2 = 1, a value for which\nthe corresponding potential is neither well approximated by a linear one nor a harmonic\none. As can be seen, our approximate expressions are better than 1% for any value of n and\nl quantum numbers. Such a good description is general and valid whatever the parameter \u03b2\nchosen.\nThe upper bounds obtained with P(r) = r2 are far better than\n\u221a the lower bounds computed with P(r) = \u22121/r. This is expected since the potential a2 r2 + b2 is closer to a\nharmonic interaction than to a Coulomb one. Better lower bounds could be obtained with\nP(r) = r. But, the exact form of Q is not known for this potential,\nexcept\n\u221a\n\u221a for l = 0 for which\nQ is given by (4.8). With the approximate form Q = (\u03c0 / 3)n + l + 3\u03c0 /4,38), 40) we have\nchecked that results obtained are good but the variational character cannot be guaranteed.\n\n\f34\nTable VIII.

Exponential-type potentials\nIn this section, we apply the AFM to find approximate closed analytical formulae for\n\u03b7\ncentral potentials of exponential form, that is \u2212\u03b1 e\u2212(\u03b2 r) where \u03b1 , \u03b2 , \u03b7 are positive real\nnumber. We thus start with the following Hamiltonian\n\nH=\n\n\u03b7\np2\n\u2212 \u03b1 e\u2212(\u03b2 r) .\n2m\n\n(4.29)\n\nTwo particular cases are of current use in physics:\n\u2022 The first one is the Gaussian potential (\u03b7 = 2) which was intensively used in molecular\nand nuclear physics because it allows very often an exact analytical expression of\nvarious matrix elements.\n\u2022 The second one is the pure exponential (\u03b7 = 1), used also in nuclear physics and for\nwhich exact analytical expression for the energies in S-state are known.\n\n\f35\n4.4.1. Expression of the energies\nUsing the scaling laws, the eigenenergies E(m, \u03b1 , \u03b2 , \u03b7 ; n, l) can be written\nE(m, \u03b1 , \u03b2 , \u03b7 ; n, l) =\n\n\u03b22\n\u03b5 (\u03b7 , g; n, l),\n2m\n\n(4.30)\n\nwhere \u03b5 (\u03b7 , g; n, l) is en eigenvalue of the dimensionless Hamiltonian\n\u03b7\n\nh = p 2 \u2212 g e\u2212r ,\nwith\ng=\n\n(4.31)\n\n2m\u03b1\n.\n\u03b22\n\n(4.32)\n\nAn interesting feature of exponential-type potentials is that they all admit a finite number of\nbound states that depends on the dimensionless parameter g, ruling the potential depth, and\ndefined by (4.32). There exists thus \"critical constants\": Potential depths beyond which new\nbound states appear. We refer the reader to Ref. 66) for detailed explanations about how\nto compute critical constants in a given potential. The definition and the properties of the\nLambert function, that will frequently appear in our calculations, are given in Appendix C.\nSome of these potentials have been studied with the AFM in Ref. 67).\nThe application of (4.10) gives\nr0\u03b7 +2 exp(\u2212r0\u03b7 ) =\n\n2Q2\n.\n\u03b7g\n\n(4.33)\n\nIntroducing the parameter\nY\u03b7 =\n\n\u03b7\n\u03b7 +2\n\n\u0012\n\n2 Q2\n,\n\u03b7g\n\n\u0013\u03b7 /(\u03b7 +2)\n\n,\n\n(4.34)\n\nthe solution of (4.33) is obtainable using the properties of the Lambert function\n\u00131/\u03b7\n\u03b7 +2\nr0 = \u2212\nW (\u2212Y\u03b7 )\n.\n\u03b7\n\u0012\n\n(4.35)\n\nLastly the AFM energy is given by (4.12). A straightforward calculation gives the final\nresult\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03b7 +2\n\u03b7 +2\n\u03b5AFM (\u03b7 , g; n, l) = \u2212g exp\nW0 (\u2212Y\u03b7 ) 1 +\nW0 (\u2212Y\u03b7 )\n\u03b7\n2\n\u0012\n\u0015\n\u0013 \u03b7\u03b7+2 \u0014\n\u2212Y\u03b7\n\u03b7 +2\n= \u2212g\n(4.36)\nW0 (\u2212Y\u03b7 ) ,\n1+\nW0 (\u2212Y\u03b7 )\n2\nwith Y\u03b7 given by (4.34). The energy \u03b5AFM must be negative, which implies that W (\u2212Y\u03b7 ) \u2265\n\u22122/(\u03b7 + 2). This is only possible for the branch W0 with a negative argument, which is\nthe case since \u2212Y\u03b7 < 0. The quality of this formula for the Gaussian potential (\u03b7 = 2) is\ndiscussed in Ref. 68) and for the pure exponential (\u03b7 = 1) in Refs. 53), 67).\n\n\f36\nLet us just mention that eigenenergies of Hamiltonian (4.31) for the pure exponential\n(\u03b7 = 1) can be analytically computed for l = 0 only. But even in this case, the expression of\n\u03b5 (g) is not very tractable since it is formally defined by the relation9)\n\u221a\n(4.37)\nJ2\u221a\u2212\u03b5 (g) (2 g) = 0,\nwhere J\u03c1 is a Bessel function of the first kind. Consequently, the AFM result is interesting\nsince it yields an analytical formula for the energy levels of the pure exponential potential\nthat is of simpler use than (4.37) for l = 0 and, above all, that remains valid for arbitrary n\nand l quantum numbers.\n4.4.2. Critical constants\nBy definition, the critical constants g\u03b7 ;nl of the potential are such that \u03b5AFM (\u03b7 , g =\ng\u03b7 ;nl ; n, l) = 0, with \u03b5 given by (4.36). Of course this is the AFM approximation of these\ncritical constants, but according to this last equation, one finds that the energy vanishes for\nY\u03b7 = 2/(\u03b7 + 2) e\u22122/(\u03b7 +2) , a value which is lower than 1/e as required by (4.35). Equivalently (equating this particular value of Y\u03b7 with the general value (4.34)), one can say that\nthe critical constants are given by\ng\u03b7 ;nl =\n\n\u0010 \u03b7 e \u00112/\u03b7\n2\n\nQ(n, l)2 .\n\n(4.38)\n\nThey are such that, if g > gn0 l0 , the potential admits a bound state with the given quantum\nnumbers n0 , l0 . It is remarkable that our approximation scheme, based on the potential\nP(x) = x\u03bb for which an infinite number of bound states is present, is able to predict that only\na finite number of bound states will be present in exponential potentials. This is another\ntest of the ability of the AFM to analytically reproduce the qualitative features of a given\neigenvalue problem. Let us note that the AFM does not give any information about the\noptimal power-law potential to determine the form of the number Q(n, l). For that, we can\nrely on direct comparison with numerical solution. It is also very remarkable that whatever\nthe power \u03b7 , the critical constants are always proportional to the square of the principal\nquantum number Q.\nThe critical constants for the Gaussian potential are discussed in Ref. 68) and for the\npure exponential in Ref. 67). Let us just discuss a little bit this last case. Equation (4.37)\nleads to a determination of the exact critical constants gn0 (\u03b7 = 1 is here always assumed\nand is no longer indicated); let us denote them as g\u2217n0 . Indeed these critical constants are\nsuch that they correspond to a energy level \u03b5 (g\u2217n0 ) = 0. We are thus led to the equation\np \u0001\nj2\nJ0 2 g\u2217n0 = 0 \u21d2 g\u2217n0 = n ,\n4\n\n(4.39)\n\nwhere jn is the (n + 1)th zero of the Bessel function J0 . At large n, these are given by\njn \u2248 \u03c0 (n + 3/4),69) leading to the asymptotic expression\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c02\n3 2\n\u2217\ngn0 \u2248\n.\n(4.40)\nn+\n4\n4\nThis result is qualitatively similar to (4.38), stating that gn0 \u221d Q(n, 0)2 .\n\n\f37\nWe can try to use formula (4.40) to improve the result (4.38). Assuming that Qnl =\nb n + l + c with no constraint on parameters b and c, it is easy to see that formulae (4.38)\nand (4.40) coincide for gn0 with b = \u03c0 /e and c = 3\u03c0 /(4e). We can then try a new relation\nto compute the critical constants\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c0\ne\n3\u03c0 2\nge;nl =\n.\n(4.41)\nn+ l +\n2\n2\n8\nThis formula is in good agreement with exact results: For n \u2208 [0, 5] and l \u2208 [0, 5], the minimal, maximal and mean relative errors are respectively 0.03%, 8.7% and 3.5%.67)\n4.5. Yukawa potential\nAmong all the central interactions, the Yukawa potential is widely used in atomic\nphysics (effective interaction), nuclear physics (long range behavior of the nucleon-nucleon\ninteraction, due to one pion exchange), hadronic physics (screened Coulomb force). It is\nthus interesting to apply the AFM to this very important case. We start with the following\nHamiltonian\np2\ne\u2212\u03b2 r\n\u2212\u03b1\n.\n(4.42)\nH=\n2m\nr\n4.5.1. Expression of the energies\nUsing the scaling laws, the eigenenergies E(m, \u03b1 , \u03b2 ; n, l) can be written\nE(m, \u03b1 , \u03b2 ; n, l) =\n\n\u03b22\n\u03b5 (g; n, l),\n2m\n\n(4.43)\n\nwhere \u03b5 (g; n, l) is en eigenvalue of the dimensionless Hamiltonian\nh = p2 \u2212 g\n\ne\u2212r\n,\nr\n\n(4.44)\n\nwith\n\n2m\u03b1\n.\n(4.45)\n\u03b2\nThis potentials admits also a finite number of bound states that depends on the dimensionless\nparameter g, ruling the potential depth, and defined by (4.45).\nThe application of the AFM to this case leads to the transcendental equation (see (4.10))\ng=\n\ne\u2212r0 r0 (1 + r0 ) =\n\n2Q2\n= T.\ng\n\n(4.46)\n\nAs far as we know, there does not exist an analytical expression giving r0 in terms of T . Let\nus introduce formally the inverse function \u03a9 = t \u22121 of the function t(u) = eu u(u \u2212 1). By\ndefinition, we have the properties\n\n\u03a9 [eu u(u \u2212 1)] = u = e\u03a9 (u) \u03a9 (u)(\u03a9 (u) \u2212 1).\n\n(4.47)\n\nThus one has r0 = \u2212\u03a9 (T ). A calculation giving the AFM energy through (4.12) leads to\nthe expression\ng T [1 + \u03a9 (T )]\n\u03b5AFM (g; n, l) =\n.\n(4.48)\n2 \u03a9 (T )2 [\u03a9 (T ) \u2212 1]\n\n\f38\n\n\u03a9 (u) is a multi-valued function composed of 3 monotonic branches (see Fig. 3). However,\nwe have the constraints that r0 > 0 and \u03b5AFM < 0. This imposes the condition \u22121 \u2264 \u03a9 (T ) <\n0, with T > 0. This condition automatically selects the branches, passing through the origin,\ndefined in [\u2212 exp(1/\u03c6 )/\u03c6 3 , exp(\u2212\u03c6 )\u03c6 3 ] and whose image is in [\u2212\u03c6 , 1/\u03c6 ], where \u03c6 is the\ngolden ratio. So, there is no ambiguity. It is possible to obtain an approximate AFM energy\nformula in terms of usual simple functions, but it is then necessary to use an approximate\nform for the solution of the transcendental equation (4.46).67) Since \u03a9 (u) \u2248 \u2212u for u \u226a 1,\nwe find\ng2\nlim \u03b5AFM (g; n, l) = \u2212 2 .\n(4.49)\ng\u2192\u221e\n4Q\nWith the choice Q = QC , this corresponds to the Coulomb energy.

This seems\nquite natural since a Yukawa potential is similar in form to a Coulomb one. It is possible\nto improve the accuracy of the AFM formula by using an appropriate form Q = A(g)n +\nl + C(g)67) but the variational character of the approximation cannot then guaranteed. An\naccurate energy formula has been found in Ref. 70) from a fit of the numerically computed\nenergy levels of the Yukawa potential. In our notations, it reads\n\n\u03b5nl = \u2212\nwith\n\ng \u2212 2A\u2032 (QC + \u03c3 )2 + 2B\u2032 QC2\ng\n(g\n\u2212\ng\n)\nG;nl\n4QC2\ng \u2212 gG;nl + 2B\u2032 QC2\n\n\u0013\nn 2\ngG;nl = 2\nZl +\n,\nSl\nwhere A\u2032 = 1.9875, B\u2032 = 1.2464 and \u03c3 = 0.003951, and where\n\u0012\n\np\n\nZl = Z0 (1 + \u03c1 l + \u03c4 l 2 ), Sl = S0 (1 + \u03b3 l + \u03b4 l 2 ),\nZ0 = 0.839908, \u03c1 = 2.7359, \u03c4 = 1.6242,\nS0 = 1.1335, \u03b3 = 0.019102, \u03b4 = \u22120.001684.\n\n(4.50)\n\n(4.51)\n\n(4.52)\n\nThis formula is rather different from ours. However, they coincide at the limit g \u2192 \u221e when\nQ = Qc (see (4.49)).

Not all bound states can be found with (4.48). Let us note that\nformula (4.50) gives generally the correct number of bound states, but not in all cases.67)\nFormula (4.48) with Q = QC gives quite good results for the lowest eigenvalues. The quality\nof the fit for formula (4.50) is better but comparable to the quality of AFM formula (4.48)\nwith a more sophisticated parameterization of Q.67) Nevertheless, formula (4.50) is empirical, while AFM result (4.48) is obtained from an explicit analytical resolution of the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation.\n4.5.2. Critical constants\nLet us discuss below more deeply the critical constants relative to the Yukawa potential.\nIt is easy to find from (4.48) that the T value which cancels the AFM energy is equal to\nT = 2/e. Using the definition (4.46), one obtains the AFM critical constants for the Yukawa\npotential\ngyuk;nl = eQ2 .\n(4.53)\nIt is again remarkable that the critical constants for the Yukawa potential are also proportional to the square of the principal quantum number, a property that seems universal for\nexponential-like potentials.\nDue to the smallness of \u03b3 and \u03b4 in (4.51), we can replace Sl by S0 in (4.51). It clearly ap\u00112\n\u0010 p\npears that gG;nl \u221d S0 Z0 \u03b2 l + n asymptotically. This is precisely the quadratic behavior\npredicted by our analytical results. It is important to stress that formula (4.51) was specially\ndesigned for fitting the Yukawa critical constants and that it needs several free parameters,\nwhile our AFM result (4.53) follows a general algorithm valid in any circumstance. The\nfact that both give the same asymptotic behavior is again a very strong argument in favor\nof the relevance of the AFM. Introducing a constant which allows to obtain the exact result for n = l = 0 and considering the asymptotic expansion for large values of l, (4.51) is\napproximately given by\ngG;nl \u2248 (1.248 n + 1.652 l + 1.296)2 .\n\n(4.54)\n\n\f40\nThis is not too different from our result (4.53) with Q = QC = n + l + 1\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(4.55)\ngyuk;nl (Qc ) = ( e n + e l + e)2 ,\n\u221a\nsince e \u2248 1.649. This formula is unfortunately not very accurate: For n \u2208 [0, 4] and l \u2208\n[0, 4], the minimal, maximal and mean relative errors are respectively 6%, 42% and 26%.\nThe minimal, maximal and mean relative errors are respectively 0.01%, 0.9% and 0.3% with\nformula (4.51). The very good quality of these last results is due to the use of a complicated\nformula fitted on exact results. Our formula is simpler and the general behavior is predicted\nby the AFM. Let us note that it is possible to improve the values of AFM critical constants\nfor the Yukawa potential using an appropriate form Q = An + Bl +C, with A, B and C fixed,\nand keeping the simplicity of the original formula (4.53).67)\n4.6. Sum of power-law potentials\nIn Sect. 2.4.1 we suggested that potentials of type aP(r) + V (r) could be treated with\nthe AFM in some occasions. Since a power-law potential is very often a good starting point,\nit is interesting to see whether an analytical AFM solution exists for a second contribution\nwhich is itself a power-law potential. The resulting total potential is thus the sum of two\npower-law potentials. Those types of potential are frequently used in various domains of\nquantum mechanics. This is the subject of this section, whose calculations are based on\n(2.37) and (2.38).\n4.6.1. Expression of the energies\nIt is very instructive to start with the potential P(r) = sgn(\u03b7 )r\u03b7 = P(\u03b7 ) (r). In this case,\nthe extremization condition (2.37) is written (see also (4.9))\na|\u03b7 |r0\u03b7 +2 + r03V \u2032 (r0 ) =\n\nQ2\u03b7\n,\nm\n\n(4.56)\n\nwhere Q\u03b7 is a priori the optimal principal quantum number for P(\u03b7 ) (r). The AFM energy\n(2.38) is given by\nQ\u03b72\nEAFM =\n+ sgn(\u03b7 )ar0\u03b7 +V (r0 ).\n(4.57)\n2\n2mr0\nWith this in mind, let us introduce the potential V (r) in the form of a power-law potential\nsgn(\u03bb )br\u03bb so that the total potential for our system is given by\nW (r) = sgn(\u03b7 )ar\u03b7 + sgn(\u03bb )br\u03bb .\n\n(4.58)\n\nThe above considerations show that the extremization condition and the AFM energy look\nlike\na|\u03b7 |r0\u03b7 +2 + b|\u03bb |r0\u03bb +2 =\nEAFM =\n\nQ\u03b72\n2mr02\n\nQ\u03b72\nm\n\n+ sgn(\u03b7 )ar0\u03b7 + +sgn(\u03bb )br0\u03bb .\n\n(4.59)\n(4.60)\n\nShould have we taken instead P(r) = P(\u03bb ) (r) and V (r) = P(\u03b7 ) (r), we would have recovered the same physical problem with the potential W (r) given by (4.58). Due to the form\n\n\f41\nof basic equations (2.37) and (2.38) the only change would have been Q\u03b7 \u2192 Q\u03bb . Because\nof the symmetry of the problem there is no reason to prefer the choice Q\u03b7 , as in the previous\nequations, instead of the choice Q\u03bb ; moreover in any application, we already saw that it is\nconvenient to change the value of the principal quantum number. In consequence, in the\nfollowing, we will use the more neutral notation Q. This result can also be directly obtained\nby using (4.15)-(4.17), but it is interesting to illustrate that the AFM depends only on the\npotential P(r) through the principal quantum number Q.\nIn general, one does not have an analytical expression for the root of the extremization\nequation (4.59). This is possible only for very specific values of the powers \u03b7 and \u03bb .\nIn this section, we will study such a problem for the most favorable cases, where \u03b7 is\nchosen to give an exact expression for the eigenvalues (in practice \u03b7 = 2 and \u03b7 = \u22121) and\nwhere \u03bb is chosen in order to have an analytical result. In the following, it is assumed that\na > 0, b > 0 and \u22122 \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 2.\n\n4.6.2. Solvable potentials\nLet us examine first the case P(r) = r2 . The extremization equation is a transcendental\nequation for which an analytical solution does not exist automatically. The only cases for\nwhich we are sure that an analytical solution exists is when it can be transformed into a\npolynomial of degree less than or equal to 4. In order to investigate this condition, let us\nput (\u03bb + 2)/4 = p/q (p and q are relatively prime integers), and define the new variable\n4/q\nX = r0 . The corresponding extremization condition is transformed into\nQ2\n.\n(4.61)\nm\nAll the solvable potentials should verify the conditions 0 \u2264 p \u2264 4, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 4. An\nexhaustive research of all the solvable potentials in our domain for \u03bb leads to the following,\nnon trivial, values of the power \u03bb :\n2aX q + b|\u03bb |X p =\n\n2 2\n\u03bb = \u22122, \u22121, \u2212 , , 1.\n3 3\n\n(4.62)\n\nWe will study in detail the cases:\n\u2022 \u03bb = \u22122 because it corresponds to a centrifugal term with a real parameter instead of\nthe usual l(l + 1) term;\n\u2022 \u03bb = \u22121 because it corresponds to a simplified potential for hadronic systems with a\nshort range Coulomb potential and a quadratic confinement;\n\u2022 \u03bb = 1 because this anharmonic potential is sometimes used in molecular physics.\nNow we investigate the case P(r) = \u22121/r. The same type of argument with \u03bb +2 = p/q\n1/q\nand X = r0 leads to the following polynomial equation\nQ2\n.\nm\nAn exhaustive list of the non trivial solvable potentials is given below\naX q + b|\u03bb |X p =\n\n7\n5\n3\n4\n5\n2\n1\n\u03bb = \u22122, \u2212 , \u2212 , \u2212 , \u2212 , \u2212 , \u2212 , \u2212 , 1, 2.\n4\n3\n2\n3\n4\n3\n2\nAmong them we will study:\n\n(4.63)\n\n(4.64)\n\n\f42\n\u2022 \u03bb = 2 because it corresponds to a potential \u2212a/r + br2 which is already studied with\nP(r) = r2 . This is the only potential that can be described with either P(r) = r2 or\nP(r) = \u22121/r and this property allows very fruitful comparisons.\n\u2022 \u03bb = 1 because it corresponds to the funnel potential (Coulomb + linear) which is\nwidely used in hadron spectroscopy.32) Finding approximate analytical values for the\nenergies corresponding to this potential is thus a very interesting question. To our\nknowledge, such formulae have not been proposed in the literature.\nIt could be also interesting to introduce potentials with \u03bb \u2264 \u22122 but with the restriction\nthat it is repulsive at the origin (for instance, van der Waals forces or Lennard-Jones type of\npotentials). In this case, the transcendental equation is modified a little bit since \u03bb + 2 \u2264 0\nimplying a negative fraction p/q. An exhaustive research of the different values of \u03bb gives\nthe following results:\n5\n7\n\u03bb = \u22125, \u22124, \u22123, \u2212 , \u2212 , \u22122.\n(4.65)\n2\n3\nIn this list, we will just consider the case:\n\u2022 \u03bb = \u22122 because the corresponding potential, known as the Kratzer potential, exhibits\nits spectrum under an analytical form for all values of radial quantum number n and\norbital quantum number l.\n4.6.3. Kratzer potential\nThe Kratzer potential9) is defined in its simpler form as\na2 2a\n(4.66)\n\u2212 .\nr2\nr\nIt can mimic the interaction of two atoms in a diatomic molecule. Moreover, it presents\nsome interest as a benchmark since it is one of the rare potentials for which ones knows an\nexact analytical expression of the energies valid for any n and l quantum numbers. In fact,\none can define the Kratzer potential in a more general formulation (see Ref. 71)) as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nf\nV (r) = G 2 \u2212\n.\n(4.67)\nr\nr\nV (r) =\n\nOne recovers the simplest form putting G = a2 and f = 2/a.\nIt can be shown (see for example the hint given in Ref. 9)) that the exact eigenenergies\nread\nmG2 f 2\n(4.68)\nE(n, l) = \u2212 h\ni2 .\np\n2 n + 1/2 + (l + 1/2)2 + 2mG\n\nApplying the previous AFM expressions to this potential leads to the following mean\nradius (\u03b7 = \u22121, \u03bb = \u22122, a = G f and b = \u2212G in (4.58))\nr0 =\n\n2mG + Q2\nmG f\n\n(4.69)\n\nwhich, inserted in (4.60), gives the desired result\nE (K) (n, l) = \u2212\n\nmG2 f 2\n.\n2 [2mG + Q2 ]\n\n(4.70)\n\n\f43\nIt is natural to set Q = QC = n + l + 1, considering that P(r) = \u22121/r. We thus remark that\nthe approximate value E (K) presents the correct asymptotic behavior for large n and for large\nl. Just to have an idea of the quality of this approximation, let us calculate the difference\n\u03b4 between the terms in brackets appearing in the denominators of E and E (K) . It is just a\nmatter of simple algebra to find\n#\n\"s\n2mG\n\u22121 .\n(4.71)\n\u03b4 = (2n + 1)(l + 1/2)\n1+\n(l + 1/2)2\nOne always has \u03b4 > 0 so that E(n, l) > E (K) (n, l) meaning that the AFM approximation\nis a lower bound. Moreover, for small intensity and/or mass, mG \u226a 1, or for large angular\nmomentum, l \u226b 1, the approximate value tends to the exact one and we have more explicitly\n\n\u03b4 \u2192 (2n + 1)\n\nmG\n\u226a 1.\n(l + 1/2)\n\n(4.72)\n\nFor these limit conditions, the AFM approximation tends towards the exact result. This behavior is easily understandable because, under those conditions, the contribution due to 1/r\nis predominant as compared to the contribution of 1/r2 , and both expressions tend towards\nthe same exact Coulomb result.\n4.6.4. Quadratic + centrifugal potential\nWe consider now the potential (for an attractive centrifugal potential, not all values of\nb are relevant72) )\nb\n(4.73)\nV (r) = ar2 \u00b1 2 .\nr\nThe incorporation of the term \u00b1b/r2 into the l(l + 1)/r2 term already present in p 2 allows\nto get the exact eigenvalue using the same kind of arguments than those developed in the\nharmonic oscillator case.9) Explicitly, we obtain\nr\n\u0015\n\u0014\nq\na\nE(n, l) =\n(4.74)\n2(2n + 1) + (2l + 1)2 \u00b1 8mb .\n2m\n\nUsing the AFM with P(r) = r2 and setting Y = 2mb/Q2 , the value r0 that extremizes\nthis energy comes from a first degree equation and reads\n\u0012\n\u0013\nb(1 \u00b1Y ) 1/4\nr0 =\n.\n(4.75)\naY\nSubstituting this value intopthe energy (4.60), one obtains a very simple expression for the\napproximate energy E = 2 ab(1 \u00b1Y )/Y or, alternatively\nr\na p 2\n(qc)\nE (m, a, b; n, l) = 2\nQ \u00b1 2mb.\n(4.76)\n2m\nThis quantity and the corresponding exact one depend on three parameters m, a, b but\nwe know that the general scaling law properties allow us to write them in a more pleasant\nform\nr\na\n\u03b5 (\u03b2 = 2mb; n, l),\n(4.77)\nE(m, a, b; n, l) =\n2m\n\n\f44\nwhere \u03b5 (\u03b2 ; n, l) is an eigenvalue of the reduced Schr\u00f6dinger equation for which the Hamiltonian depends now on a single dimensionless parameter \u03b2\nh = p 2 + r2 \u00b1\n\n\u03b2\n.\nr2\n\nThe exact eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian are given by\nq\n\u03b5 (\u03b2 ; n, l) = 2(2n + 1) + (2l + 1)2 \u00b1 4\u03b2 .\nThe approximate values immediately come from (4.76)\np\n\u03b5 (qc) (\u03b2 ; n, l) = 2 Q2 \u00b1 \u03b2 .\n\n(4.78)\n\n(4.79)\n\n(4.80)\n\nIt seems natural to choose Q = QHO , considering that P(r) = r2 . In this case, one can check\nthat the relative error between \u03b5 and \u03b5 (qc) decreases as l \u22123 for a fixed value of n and large l;\nit decreases as n\u22121 for a fixed value of l and large n. This behavior is easily understandable\nbecause, for large values of the quantum numbers, the contribution due to r2 is predominant\nas compared to the contribution of 1/r2 and both expressions tends towards the same exact\nharmonic oscillator result.\nLet us assume that \u03b2 \u226a 1 and let us choose Q = QHO ; a Taylor expansion truncated to\nfirst order leads to\n\u03b2\n.\n(4.81)\n\u03b5 (qc) (\u03b2 ; n, l) \u2248 2QHO \u00b1\nQHO\nIt is easy to check that this expression can also be obtained by perturbation theory. In\nparticular for \u03b2 = 0, one recovers the exact value 2QHO , as expected.\n4.6.5.

It is natural to use the value Q = QHO , considering that P(r) = r2 .\nAs in the previous case, this quantity and the corresponding exact one depend on three\nparameters m, a, b but the general scaling law allows us to write them in terms of a reduced\nquantity depending on a single parameter \u03b2\n!\nr\nr\n2a\n3b2 3m\n; n, l ,\n(4.86)\nE(m, a, b; n, l) =\n\u03b5 \u03b2=\n3m\n16 2a3\nwhere \u03b5 (\u03b2 ; n, l) is an eigenvalue of the reduced Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the Hamiltonian\nh=\n\np\np2\n+ 3r2 + 8 \u03b2 r.\n4\n\n(4.87)\n\nThe approximate value corresponding to this reduced equation follows from (4.85)\n\n\u03b5\n\n(an)\n\n(\u03b2 ; n, l) = 2 \u03b2 Y\n\n\u0012\n\nG2\u2212 (Y ) +\n\n\u0013\n1\n,\nG\u2212 (Y )\n\n\u0012 \u00132/3\nQ\n.\nY=\n\u03b2\n\n(4.88)\n\nThe parameter \u03b2 could also be associated with the quadratic potential, but this less interesting case is not considered here.\nLet us assume that \u03b2 \u226a 1 and let us choose Q = QHO ; a Taylor expansion truncated to\nfirst order leads to\ns\n\u221a\n2\u03b2 QHO\n(an)\n\u221a\n\u03b5 (\u03b2 ; n, l) \u2248 3QHO + 4\n.\n(4.89)\n3\n\u221a\nIn particular for \u03b2 = 0, one recovers the exact value 3QHO , as it should be.

The equation that leads to the extremization of the\nb\nenergy is then 4x4 + 8x \u2212 3Y = 0. This reduced quartic equation is studied in Sect. B.2. Its\nsolution is given by x(Y ) = G+ (Y ) (see (B.7)). Substituting this value into the energy (4.60),\none is led, after some manipulations, to the desired approximate energy\n\u0012\n\u00131/3 \u0014\n\u0015\n4\nY\n3 ab2\n(qC)\n\u2212\nE\n(m, a, b; n, l) =\n,\n(4.94)\n4\n2\nG2+ (Y ) G+ (Y )\nwith Y given by (4.93). As usual with the AFM, the quality of the approximation depends\non the choice of Q. For instance, the use of Q = QC and Q = QHO in the expression for Y\ngives respectively a lower bound and an upper bound on the true energy.\nThe quantity (4.94) and the corresponding exact one depend again on three parameters\nm, a, b but the general scaling law allows us to write them in terms of a reduced quantity\ndepending on a single dimensionless parameter \u03b2 .

Closed-form solutions are found for particular values of magnetic field and spatial confinement length. It is argued that a generalization to a three-dimensional space is possible.\nBut, as the corresponding formulae are not given explicitly, a comparison with our results\nis not available. More generally, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with a \u2212a/r + b r + c r2 potential\n(particular cases are studied in Sect. 4.6.6 and 4.6.7) is directly linked with the biconfluent\nHeun's equation.74)\n4.6.7. Funnel potential\nIn this section, we study the funnel potential defined as\nb\nV (r) = ar \u2212 .\nr\n\n(4.106)\n\nThis potential is particularly important and its interest is discussed in Sect. 4.6.2.

In hadronic physics, the dominant interaction between a quark and an antiquark is a confining linear potential.32) So, although the\nlinear potential has no analytical exact solution for all values of the quantum numbers, it is\nalso interesting to consider two formulations depending on whether \u03b2 is part of the linear\ncontribution or of the Coulomb contribution:\n!\n\u0012 2 \u00131/3\n\u0012 2 3 \u00131/4\na\n4m b\n; n, l ,\n(4.111)\nE(m, a, b; n, l) = 3\n\u03b5 \u03b2=\n2m\n27a\n!\n\u00131/4\n\u0012\n27a\n2mb2\n; n, l .\n(4.112)\nE(m, a, b; n, l) = 5/3 \u03b7 \u03b2 \u2032 =\n4m2 b3\n3\nThe \u03b5 and \u03b7 energies are the eigenvalues of the reduced Schr\u00f6dinger equations for the\nrespective Hamiltonians h\u03b5 et h\u03b7 :\np 2 r \u03b2 4/3\n+ \u2212\n,\n(4.113)\n3\n3\nr\np 2 31/3\n4\nh\u03b7 =\n\u2212\n+ \u03b2 \u2032 r.\n(4.114)\n3\nr\nThe approximate values corresponding to these reduced Hamiltonian follow from (4.109):\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0012 \u00132\n2\nY\nQ\n(f)\n2/3\n\u03b5 (\u03b2 ; n, l) = \u03b2\n,\n(4.115)\n\u2212\n, Y=\n2\nF+ (Y )\nF+ (Y )\n\u03b2\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u00012\nY\u2032\n2\n(f)\n\u2032\n2/3 \u2032 2\n(4.116)\n\u2212\n, Y \u2032 = Q\u03b2 \u2032 .\n\u03b7 (\u03b2 ; n, l) = 3 \u03b2\n\u2032\n2\n\u2032\nF+ (Y )\nF+ (Y )\nh\u03b5 =\n\nLet us assume that \u03b2 \u226a 1 or \u03b2 \u2032 \u226a 1:\n\u2022 The Taylor expansion for the formulation based on the \u03b5 form gives\n\u0012 4 \u00131/3\nQ2/3\n\u03b2\n(f)\n\u03b5 (\u03b2 ; n, l) \u2248 2/3 \u2212\n.\n2\n2Q\n2\n\n(4.117)\n\nIn particular for \u03b2 = 0, one recovers the value expected for a pure linear potential, as\ngiven by (4.7).\n\n\f49\n\u2022 The Taylor expansion for the formulation based on the \u03b7 form gives\n35/3 2Q2 \u03b2 \u2032 4\n\u03b7 (\u03b2 ; n, l) \u2248 \u2212 2 + 4/3 .\n4Q\n3\n(f)\n\n\u2032\n\n(4.118)\n\nIn particular for \u03b2 \u2032 = 0, one recovers the exact value \u221235/3 /(4Q2 ) for the Coulomb\npotential if Q = QC .\nIn all these cases, the approximate formulae resulting from AFM agree with the result of\nperturbation theory.\nThe limits \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e and \u03b2 \u2032 \u2192 \u221e are interesting to consider in order to check the formulae:\n\u2022 The \u03b5 -based formulation gives\n\u0011\n\u0010\n3\u03b2 8/3\n\u22124/3\n\u03b5 (f) (\u03b2 ; n, l) = \u2212\n\u03b2\n.\n(4.119)\n+\nO\n4Q2\nThe dominant term is the exact result for a Coulomb potential if Q = QC .\n\u2022 The \u03b7 -based formulation gives\n\u0012\n\u00132/3\n\u0010\n\u0011\n3 \u20324\n4/3\n+O \u03b2\u2032\n.\n\u03b7 (f) (\u03b2 \u2032 ; n, l) =\n\u03b2 Q\n2\n\n(4.120)\n\nThe dominant term is the result expected for a pure linear potential, as given by (4.7).\nHere again, both (4.113) and (4.114) can be related with the scaling laws.

Comparison with numerical results\nThe potentials studied in this section are rather sophisticated and, presumably, the AFM\nshould lead to less good results than power-law potentials. Thus, it is interesting to test\nthis method in these less favorable cases. A detailed discussion can be found in Ref. 40).\nHere we focus our analysis on the funnel potential only, because of its physical importance,\nand rely on the reduced Hamiltonian h\u03b5 (4.113). The AFM energies \u03b5 (f) (\u03b2 ; n, l) are given\nby (4.115). For most of the hadronic systems, the physical values of \u03b2 vary from 0 to about\n1.5.\nAs usual, the simplest prescription to improve harmonic oscillator or Coulomb-like\nresults is to adopt a principal quantum number of the form\nQ(\u03b2 ) = b(\u03b2 )n + l + c(\u03b2 ).\n\n(4.122)\n\nThe protocol to determine the best values for the b and c coefficients follows essentially the\nsame steps than those explained in Sect. 3.4.2 and is not repeated here. The only difference\nis the form of the functions b(\u03b2 ) and c(\u03b2 ) which are better fitted with Gaussian functions\nthan hyperbolae. Explicitly, the parameterization retained is\n\u0001\n\u0001\nb(\u03b2 ) = 1 + p1 exp \u2212p22 \u03b2 2 , c(\u03b2 ) = 1 + q1 exp \u2212q22 \u03b2 2 .\n(4.123)\nWith this choice, b(\u221e) = 1 = c(\u221e) as it should be since in this case we have a pure coulomb\npotential. For \u03b2 = 0 we are in presence of a pure linear potential and for l = 0 we do know\n\n\f50\n\u221a\n\u221a\nthe exact result. With this in mind, we choose b(0) = \u03c0 / 3 and c(0) = 3\u03c0 /4. The only\nfree parameter is p2 for b(\u03b2 ) and\nq2 for c(\u03b2 ). The parameters retained for our study are:\n\u221a\np1 = \u221a\u03c03 \u2212 1, p2 = 0.416, q1 = 43\u03c0 \u2212 1, q2 = 1.245.\nTable X.

The values Q = QHO and Q = QC give\nrespectively an upper and a lower bound on the exact energy. However, as can be seen from\nTable X for the case Q = QC , these bounds are not very close to the exact value and, thus\nnot very interesting (the error is of the order of 10% or more). The value Q = Q(\u03b2 ) gives\nmore accurate results (the error is less than 5% and is often of order of 2-3%), but we have\nno certainty concerning the (anti)variational character of the approximation. The global\naccuracy is less good than for power-law potentials but remains quite acceptable.\n\u00a75. Two-body spinless Salpeter equation\n\nIn this section, we will apply the AFM to the spinless Salpeter Hamiltonian for which\nthe kinetic energy has a semirelativistic form\np\nH = \u03c3 p 2 + m2 +V (r).\n(5.1)\nThe term \"relativistic\" is generally not used because such a Hamiltonian is not manifestly\ncovariant. The parameter \u03c3 is equal to 1 for one-body systems (r is then the distance of the\nparticle from the origin of the force field) and to 2 for two-body systems with equal masses\n(r is then the distance between the two particles). However, it is very convenient to choose\nit as an arbitrary positive real parameter. We will prefer the notation M instead of E for the\n\n\f51\neigenvalue of this kind of Hamiltonian because it does include the rest mass of the particles.\nObviously, there is much less material concerning the properties of eigenvalues for\nsemirelativistic equations as compared to the huge bulk of results for nonrelativistic treatments. Nevertheless the quadratic potential has been studied taking the Fourier transform of\nof the potential.75) Moreover, working in momentum space, Boukraa and Basdevant were\nable to obtain interesting properties concerning a class of potentials.76)\nFor two-body systems, the presence of two different masses cannot be dealt with a\nreduced mass, so that we need the introduction of two different auxiliary fields to treat the\nkinetic energy term. This situation makes the problem much more complex. It is briefly\nstudied in Sect. 5.6. Thus, in the following, we focus on Hamiltonian (5.1).\n5.1. Scaling laws\nLet us consider the spinless Salpeter equation\n\u0010 p\n\u0011\n\u03c3 p 2 + m2 + GV (a r ) \u2212 M(m, G, a, \u03c3 ) \u03a8 (rr ) = 0,\n\n(5.2)\n\nThis is just the spinless Salpeter equation\n\u0010p\n\u0011\n\u03c0 2 + m\u20322 + G\u2032 V (\u03c1 ) \u2212 M \u2032(m\u2032 , G\u2032 , 1, 1) \u03c6 (\u03c1 ) = 0,\n\n(5.4)\n\nwhere G and a are two real numbers defining the potential, a being related to its extension\nand G to its intensity. The eigenvalues M depend a priori on the four parameters m, G, a, \u03c3 .\nScaling laws allow to obtain the general form of M(m, G, a, \u03c3 ) in terms of the energies of\nanother system depending on less free parameters. Let us examine this point.\nDefining \u03c1 = arr , \u03c0 = p /a, one has\n\u0012q\n\u0013\nG\n1\n\u03c0 2 + (m/a)2 +\nV (\u03c1 ) \u2212\nM(m, G, a, \u03c3 ) \u03a8 (\u03c1 /a) = 0.\n(5.3)\na\u03c3\na\u03c3\n\nwith\n\nM(m, G, a, \u03c3 )\nm\nG\n, M \u2032 (m\u2032 , G\u2032 , 1, 1) =\n.\n, G\u2032 =\na\na\u03c3\na\u03c3\nWe are thus led to the following scaling law for the mass spectrum\n\u0012\n\u0013\nm G\nM(m, G, a, \u03c3 ) = a \u03c3 M\n, 1, 1 .\n,\na a\u03c3\nm\u2032 =\n\n(5.5)\n\n(5.6)\n\nIt means that both one parameter of the potential (here the extension of the potential a)\nand the number of constituents in the system \u03c3 can always be set equal to 1 in order to\nsimplify the computations without loss of generality. The general energy formula will then\nbe recovered thanks to (5.6).\n5.2. Generalities\nTo deal with the worrying square root, it is interesting to introduce one auxiliary field\n\u03bc in order to build the AFM Hamiltonian corresponding to (5.1)\nH\u0303(\u03bc ) =\n\np 2 + m2 \u03c3 2\n+\n\u03bc +V (r).\n\u03bc\n4\n\n(5.7)\n\n\f52\nThe semirelativistic operator is then replaced by a nonrelativistic counterpart with a parameter \u03bc to be determined. This technique to get rid of the square root operator is not new\nand has been used previously to study hadronic physics.28), 29), 30), 31), 32) Let us remark that,\nas H\u0303(\u03bc ) and H have not the same kinetic part, most of the results about lower and upper\nbounds developed in Sect. 2.4 are not applicable. At this stage, one can imagine two cases\nwhich are discussed below.\n5.2.1. Potential V (r) is solvable\nLet us assume that the analytical solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with the potential\nV (r) is known. In particular, this approach is interesting if V (r) = r2 or V (r) = \u22121/r. One\ncan then write the eigenvalues of H\u0303(\u03bc ) as\nM(\u03bc ) =\n\nm2 \u03c3 2\n+ \u03bc + e(\u03bc ),\n\u03bc\n4\n\n(5.8)\n\nwhere e(\u03bc ) is the eigenenergy of the Hamiltonian h(\u03bc ) = p 2 /\u03bc +V (r). The final spectrum\nis given by M(\u03bc0 ), where \u03bc0 is such that \u2202\u03bc M(\u03bc ) \u03bc =\u03bc0 = 0 which implies that\n\n\u03c32\nm2\n+ e\u2032 (\u03bc0 ) = 2 .\n4\n\u03bc0\n\n(5.9)\n\nThe prime denotes a derivation with respect to \u03bc . Provided that e(\u03bc ) is analytically known,\nthe only difficulty in this procedure is the analytical resolution of this last transcendental\nequation, especially when m 6= 0. Reporting the value of \u03bc0 given by (5.9) in the expression\nof the energy (5.8) allows to write\nM(\u03bc0 ) =\n\n\u03c32\n\u03bc0 + (\u03bc e(\u03bc ))\u2032\n2\n\n\u03bc = \u03bc0\n\n.\n\n(5.10)\n\nFrom Ref. 77), we know that M(\u03bc ) \u2265 M for any state, and that M(\u03bc0 ) \u2265 M, since it is also\ntrue for the particular value \u03bc0 of the auxiliary field. The AFM yields in this case an upper\nbound. This can be also demonstrated using a simpler version of the AFM which can be\nused only when it is interesting to replace an operator by its square.41)\nUsing the Hellmann-Feynman theorem,39) it has been shown that the value of \u03bc0 is\ngiven by32), 41)\nq\n2\n\u03bc0 =\nhpp2 + m2 i,\n(5.11)\n\u03c3\nwhere the mean value is computed with an eigenstate of H\u0303(\u03bc0 ). An estimation of the difference \u03b4 between the exact and approximate eigenenergies is given by41)\nq\nE\nDp\n(5.12)\n\u03b4 = \u03c3 hpp2 + m2 i \u2212 \u03c3\np 2 + m2 .\nAt the limit of low mass, (5.1) can be written\n\n\u03c3 m2\nH \u2248 H ur + p\n2 p2\n\nwith\n\nH ur = \u03c3\n\np\n\np 2 +V (r).\n\n(5.13)\n\n\f53\nThe contribution \u2206 (m) of the mass m to an eigenenergy of the ultrarelativistic Hamiltonian\nH ur (m = 0) appears as a small contribution that can be computed as a perturbation.

Potential V (r) is not solvable\nIf the eigenvalues of h = p 2 /\u03bc +V (r) are not known, it is tempting to treat the kinetic\nenergy term and the potential term on equal footing, in the spirit of what is done in Sect. 2.2,\nintroducing the auxiliary field \u03bc to deal with T and the auxiliary field \u03bd to deal with V . The\ncase of a general function P(r) cannot be solved analytically, but restricting to the important\npower-law potential P(r) = sgn(\u03bb )r\u03bb , very interesting expressions can be obtained.\nThe eigenenergies e(\u03bc , \u03bd ) of the nonrelativistic Hamiltonian h(\u03bc , \u03bd ) = p 2 /\u03bc + \u03bd P(r)\nare given by (3.2) and (3.35) and the AFM mass by (the K and J functions are defined as\nusual)\n\u03c32\nm2\nM(\u03bc , \u03bd ) = e(\u03bc , \u03bd ) +\n\u03bc+\n+V (J(\u03bd )) \u2212 sgn(\u03bb )\u03bd J(\u03bd )\u03bb .\n(5.15)\n4\n\u03bc\nThe extremization of M needs to solve two coupled equations with respect to \u03bc and \u03bd which\nprovide the values \u03bc0 and \u03bd0 . Introducing the new variable\nx0 =\n\n\u0012\n\n|\u03bb |\n\u03bc0 \u03bd0\n2\n\n\u00132/(\u03bb +2)\n\n,\n\nit can be shown that both \u03bc0 and \u03bd0 can be expressed in terms of x0 only. Namely\nq\n2\n2\u03bb /(\u03bb +2)\n\u03bc0 (x0 ) =\nm2 + Q\u03bb\nx0 ,\n\u03c3\n2/(\u03bb +2) \u221a\n\u03bd0 (x0 ) = K(Q\u03bb\n/ x0 ).\n\n(5.16)\n\n(5.17)\n(5.18)\n\nReporting these values into the definition (5.16) allows the determination of x0 through the\ntranscendental equation\nq\n(\u03bb +2)/2\n2\u03bb /(\u03bb +2)\n2/(\u03bb +2) \u221a\n\u03c3 x0\nx0 K(Q\u03bb\n/ x0 ).\n(5.19)\n= |\u03bb | m2 + Q\u03bb\nOne deduces easily the expression of the AFM mass\nq\n2\u03bb /(\u03bb +2)\n2/(\u03bb +2) \u221a\nMAFM = \u03c3 m2 + Q\u03bb\nx0 +V (Q\u03bb\n/ x0 ).\n\n(5.20)\n\nIt is possible to go further in the simplification using the expression of the K function and\ndefining the new mean radius\n2/(\u03bb +2)\n\nQ\nr0 = \u03bb\u221a\n\nx0\n\n.\n\n(5.21)\n\n\f54\nThe transcendental equation (5.19) and the value of the AFM mass (5.20) are given now by\nsimpler expressions:\ns\n\n\u0013\nmr0 2\n,\n\u03c3 Q\u03bb =\n1+\nQ\u03bb\ns\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c3 Q\u03bb\nmr0 2\nMAFM =\n1+\n+V (r0 ).\nr0\nQ\u03bb\nr02V \u2032 (r0 )\n\n\u0012\n\n(5.22)\n(5.23)\n\nDespite the fact that two auxiliary fields were introduced, only one transcendental equation\nis necessary to solve the problem. This great simplification is due to the use of a power-law\nexpression for the basic function P(r).\nIt is also clear from (5.22) and (5.23) that, very much in the same way than the nonrelativistic case, the expression of the mean radius and of the mass depend on the \u03bb variable\nonly through the value of the principal quantum number Q(\u03bb ; n, l), which can thus be modified at will in order to improve the results. So, in the following, this quantum number will\nbe simply denoted Q.\nAs in the nonrelativistic case, the AFM also yields approximations for the eigenstates.\nThe approximant states, which are eigenstates of p 2 /\u03bc0 + \u03bd0 sgn(\u03bb )r\u03bb , are characterized by\na size parameter depending on the product \u03bc0 \u03bd0 (see (E.3), (F.3) and (G.3)). This quantity\nis given by\n2Q2\n.\n(5.24)\n\u03bc0 \u03bd0 =\n|\u03bb |r0\u03bb +2\nA lot of observables can then be computed in terms of r0 only.\nAnother procedure to solve the problem is to start from formula (5.8) and replace the\nexact value e(\u03bc ) by a corresponding approximation given by an AFM solution obtained\nfrom the Hamiltonian h(\u03bc , \u03bd0 ) = p 2 /\u03bc + \u03bd0 P(r) with P(r) = sgn(\u03bb )r\u03bb . After this first step,\nthe optimal value \u03bd0 depends not only on V (r) but also on \u03bc . One can then show that the\nsubsequent extremization on \u03bc gives exactly the results (5.22) and (5.23) presented above.\nThis procedure in two steps is nevertheless interesting to obtain informations about the\nbounds on exact energies. The replacement of the square root operator by a nonrelativistic\ncounterpart without modifying the potential, H \u2192 H\u0303(\u03bc ) (see (5.1) and (5.7)), yields upper\nbounds. If the exact potential V (r) is then replaced by an AFM approximant \u1e7c (r) \u2265 V (r),\nthe upper bounds will be further increased. On the contrary, if the new potential is such that\n\u1e7c (r) \u2264 V (r), the upper bounds will be decreased. As a consequence, the energies given by\n(5.22) are upper bounds on the exact energies if \u1e7c (r) \u2265 V (r), or equivalently if the function\ng(x) = V (P\u22121 (x)) is concave. When \u1e7c (r) \u2264 V (r) or g(x) is convex, the antivariational\ncharacter of the approximation cannot be guaranteed.\nThe previous equations take a particularly simple form for massless particles. Indeed,\nfor m = 0, they reduce to\n\n\u03c3 Q = r02V \u2032 (r0 ),\n\u03c3Q\n+V (r0 ).\nMAFM =\nr0\n\n(5.25)\n(5.26)\n\n\f55\nLet us define the function D(x) as the inverse function of x2V \u2032 (x)\nD(x2V \u2032 (x)) = x or\n\n(D(x))2V \u2032 (D(x)) = x\n\n(5.27)\n\nand the related function F(x) defined by\nF(x) =\n\nx\n+V (D(x)).\nD(x)\n\n(5.28)\n\nOnce the potential V is given, these functions are universal in the sense that they do not\ndepend on the mass m (except if the potential is mass-dependent) and can be computed once\nand for all. The mass for a system in the ultrarelativistic limit is thus written in a very simple\nform, namely\nMAFM = F(\u03c3 Q).\n(5.29)\n.\n.\n\u221a By rewriting (5 22)-(5 23) and denoting the kinetic energy by T (|pp|) with T (x) =\n2\n2\n\u03c3 x + m , the AFM formula for the energies can be written into the form\nMAFM = T (p0 ) +V (r0 ),\nQ\np0 = ,\nr0\np0 T \u2032 (p0 ) = r0V \u2032 (r0 ).\n\n(5.30)\n(5.31)\n(5.32)\n\nAs in the nonrelativistic case, (5.31) defines the mean impulsion p0 from the mean radius r0 .\nThis radius is defined by (5.25), and one can recognize again in (5.32) the general form of\nthe virial theorem.59) Finally, (5.30) gives the energy as a sum of the kinetic energy evaluated\nat the mean impulsion p0 and the potential energy evaluated at the mean radius r0 . These\nequations simplify greatly for m = 0 and reduce to (4.15)-(4.17), with MAFM = 2m + EAFM ,\nfor m \u2192 \u221e and \u03c3 = 2 (m is then the common mass of the two identical particles and not the\nreduced mass).\nThe parameter \u03bc0 can be considered as an effective mass for the relativistic parti28),\ncle. 29), 30), 31), 32) Using (5.17), (5.21) and (5.31), one finds\nq\n2\n\u03bc0 =\np20 + m2 ,\n(5.33)\n\u03c3\nwhich is a kind of \"total energy of a free particle\".\nAfter some algebra, one can check that the virial theorem applied to Hamiltonian\nH\u0303(\u03bc0 , \u03bd0 ), whose solutions are M(\u03bc0 , \u03bd0 ) given by (5.15), implies that\n+\n\u001d *\n\u001c\nr\u03bb\np2\n(5.34)\n\u03bc0 , \u03bd0 2 \u03bc0 , \u03bd0 = \u03bc0 , \u03bd0 \u03bb \u03bc0 , \u03bd0 = 1,\np0\nr0\nwhere |\u03bc0 , \u03bd0 i is an eigenstate of H\u0303(\u03bc0 , \u03bd0 ). These equations, as well as the boundary character of the solution, are only applicable when the exact form Q(\u03bb ; n, l) is used. In practice,\nthis occurs when \u03bb = \u22121 or 2, or \u03bb = 1 for S-states only. Nevertheless, a better accuracy\ncan be obtained by an appropriate choice of Q as we will see below.\n\n\f56\n5.3. Power-law potentials\n5.3.1. General case\nThe power-law potential was considered as a prototype for testing the AFM in the\nframework of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. It was shown that an analytical expression for\nthe eigenenergy is obtained whatever the power \u03bb under consideration. We apply in this\nsection the AFM to find approximate analytical energy formulae for the spinless Salpeter\nHamiltonian (5.1) with the potential V (r) = sgn(\u03bb )a r\u03bb where a is positive. We consider\nthat \u03bb > \u22122, as needed in the nonrelativistic case to have bound states. In this cases, (5.22)\nand (5.23) become\nq\n\u03c3 Q2 = a|\u03bb |r0\u03bb +1 Q2 + m2 r02 ,\n(5.35)\ns\nQ2\n+ m2 + sgn(\u03bb )a r0\u03bb .\n(5.36)\nM(\u03bb ) = \u03c3\nr02\nWith the change of variable\n1\n=\nr02\n\n\u0012\n\na|\u03bb |\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n2\n\u03bb +2\n\n4\n\nQ\u2212 \u03bb +2 x0 ,\n\n(5.37)\n\n(5.35) can be recast into\n\n\u03c3 2 \u03bb +2\n\u2212 A\u03bb x0 \u2212 m2 = 0 with A\u03bb =\nx\n4 0\n\n\u0012\n\na|\u03bb |\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n2\n\u03bb +2\n\n2\u03bb\n\nQ \u03bb +2 ,\n\n(5.38)\n\na form which will be very convenient to use. With this convention, the mass (5.36) is also\nwritten in a simple form\n\u03c3 \u03bb m2 + (\u03bb + 1)A\u03bb x0\np\nM(\u03bb ) =\n.\n(5.39)\n\u03bb\nm2 + A\u03bb x0\n\nIn order to obtain analytical energy formulae, one should be able to analytically solve\n(5.38). Let us now examine the cases for which this is possible. First, we set \u03bb + 2 = p/q\n1/q\nand X0 = x0 , where p and q are co-prime integers. Then, (5.38) becomes\n\n\u03c32 p\nX \u2212 A\u03bb X0q \u2212 m2 = 0.\n4 0\n\n(5.40)\n\nA polynomial possesses analytical roots if its order is less or equal to 4; therefore all the\nsolvable potentials should verify the conditions 0 \u2264 p \u2264 4, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 4. An exhaustive research\nof all the solvable potentials leads to the following values for the power \u03bb :\n7\n5\n3\n4\n5\n2\n1\n\u03bb = \u22122, \u2212 , \u2212 , \u2212 , \u2212 , \u2212 , \u22121, \u2212 , \u2212 , 0, 1, 2.\n4\n3\n2\n3\n4\n3\n2\n\n(5.41)\n\nAmong these allowed values, three are of particular interest: \u03bb = \u22121 and 2 because the\nCoulomb problem and the harmonic oscillator play a central role in theoretical physics, and\n\u03bb = 1 since a linearly rising potential is generally considered to be a relevant approximation\nof the confining potential in QCD.47) These three cases are explicitly solved in the following\n\n\f57\nsections. Thus, in contrast to the nonrelativistic case where an analytical expression exists\nfor an arbitrary value of \u03bb , the spinless Salpeter equation leads to a restricted list of favorable\nvalues (5.41). Fortunately, the most interesting potentials belong to this list.\nLet us briefly discuss the existence of physical solutions, as function of the parameters.\nStarting from (5.38) and (5.39), it is possible to prove the following properties:\n\u2022 For \u03bb > 0, there exists always a physical solution with M(\u03bb ) > 0.\n\u2022 For \u22121 \u2264 \u03bb < 0 there exists a physical solution with M(\u03bb ) > 0 as long as the parameter\na is less than a critical value ac (\u03bb ) given by\n!|\u03bb | \u0012\n\u0013 1+2\u03bb\nQ\nm2\nac (\u03bb ) = \u03c3 p\n.\n(5.42)\n1+\u03bb\n|\u03bb |\n\nLet us remark that ac (\u03bb ) depends on m, except ac (\u22121) = \u03c3 Q.\n\u2022 For \u22122 \u2264 \u03bb < \u22121 either there is no solution for (5.38), or there exists two solutions\nbut, in the latter case, these solutions are not compatible with the nonrelativistic expressions when m tends toward infinity. In both cases, the corresponding solutions are\nnot physical so that these types of potential must be discarded from our study.\nIn the following, we will denote Q\u03bb = Q(\u03bb ; n, l) the best possible form of the principal\nquantum number for the power-law potential V (r) = sgn(\u03bb )a r\u03bb in a Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\nWe have then Q2 = QHO , Q\u22121 = QC and Q1 given by (4.8). For other values of \u03bb , a formula\nof type (3.36) can be chosen for instance.\n5.3.2. Harmonic potential\nIf \u03bb = 2, (5.38) becomes a quartic equation of the form\n\u221a\n\u03c32 4\nx0 \u2212 A2 x0 \u2212 m2 = 0 with A2 = a Q.\n4\n\n(5.43)\n\nDefining\nx0 =\n\n\u0012\n\n2A2\n\u03c32\n\n\u00131/3\n\nX\n\nm2\nand Y2 =\n3\n\n\u0012\n\n16\u03c3\naQ2\n\n\u00132/3\n\n,\n\n(5.44)\n\n(5.43) can be rewritten as 4X 4 \u2212 8X \u2212 3Y2 = 0, which is precisely of the form (B.6).

For large value of m, the choice Q = Q2\nis clearly optimal. For small values of m, another choice could give better results.\n5.3.3. Linear potential\nThe resolution of the case \u03bb = 1 is rather similar to the one of the harmonic oscillator.\nDefining\n\u0013\n\u0012\n33/2 m2 \u03c3\nA1 1/2\nX\nand\nY\n=\n,\n(5.49)\nx0 = 2\n1\n3/2\n3\u03c3 2\n4A\n1\n\n(5.38) simply becomes a cubic equation of the form (B.1), that is X 3 \u2212 3X \u2212 2Y1 = 0. Notice\nthat A1 = (aQ/2)2/3 so that\n\u221a\n3 3\u03c3 m2\nY1 =\n.\n(5.50)\n2 aQ\nFollowing (B.2), the solution is given by X (Y1 ) = F\u2212 (Y1 ). After a rearrangement of (5.39),\nthe mass spectrum reads (under one of the equivalent forms)\nr\n2 Y1 + 3F\u2212 (Y1 )\np\nM(\u03bb = 1) = \u03c3 m\n(5.51)\nY1 3F\u2212 (Y1 ) + 2Y1\ns\n\u0012\n\u0013\nY1\n2\n=\u03c3m\n3+\n(5.52)\nY1 F\u2212 (Y1 )\nF\u2212 (Y1 )\n\u0001\n\u03c3m\n3 + F\u22122 (Y1 ) .\n(5.53)\n=p\n2Y1 F\u2212 (Y1 )\nIn the nonrelativistic limit (Y \u2192 \u221e), the last equations reduce to\n3\nM \u2248 \u03c3 m+\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c3 a2 Q2\nm\n\n\u00131/3\n\n,\n\n(5.54)\n\nas expected for a nonrelativistic Hamiltonian with a linear potential. For large value of m,\nthe choice Q = Q1 is a good one. For small values of m, another choice could give better\nresults.\n5.3.4. Coulomb potential\nEquation (5.38) is considerably simplified when \u03bb = \u22121; the value of x0 can directly\nbe extracted in this case and reads\n\u0012 \u00132\n4m2\na\nx0 = 2\nwith A\u22121 =\n.\n(5.55)\n\u03c3 \u2212 4A\u22121\n2Q\nThe energy spectrum (5.39) is finally given by\ns\n\nM(\u03bb = \u22121) = \u03c3 m 1 \u2212\n\na2\n.\n\u03c3 2 Q2\n\n(5.56)\n\nIt is obvious from this last equation that bound states exist only when a < \u03c3 Q, in agreement\nwith (5.42). The most stringent upper bound for a is actually found for the ground state,\n\n\f59\nthat is a < \u03c3 Q|n=l=0 . With Q = Q\u22121 , (5.56) yields an upper bound on the energy since this\nsetting gives the exact solution for the corresponding nonrelativistic Hamiltonian. This is\nconfirmed by the results of Refs. 77), 78) in which formula (5.56) was already given.\nAs the coupling constant a is dimensionless in this case, the only mass scale of the\nHamiltonian is m. So the nonrelativistic limit cannot be obtained by setting m \u2192 \u221e, as usual.\nIt is well known that the mean speed of the particle is independent of m and proportional\nto a in the Coulomb case. So, the nonrelativistic limit is achieved for a \u2192 0. When a \u226a 1,\n(5.56) reduces to\na2 m\nM \u2248 \u03c3m \u2212\n,\n(5.57)\n2\u03c3 Q2\nwhich corresponds to the rest energy plus the Coulomb binding energy, as expected. For\nlarge values of m, the choice Q = Q\u22121 is clearly optimal. For small values of m, another\nchoice could give better results.\nSeveral works have been devoted to the spinless Salpeter equation with a Coulomb potential,77), 78), 79), 80), 81) and it is interesting to compare our results with previously found ones.\nFirst of all, it has been shown in Ref. 79) that the energy spectrum of the semirelativistic\nCoulomb problem is unbounded from below if\na > ac =\n\n2\u03c3\n.\n\u03c0\n\n(5.58)\n\nMoreover, a lower bound on the ground-state energy Mg is79)\ns\na2\nMg \u2265 \u03c3 m 1 \u2212 2 .\nac\n\n(5.59)\n\nA last result of interest is the analytical determination of the ground-state energy performed in Ref. 81). It is found that\nMg |a=ac . \u03c3 m \u00d7 0.4842564 . . .\n\n(5.60)\n\nOur formula (5.56) leads in this case to\ns\n\nM|a=ac = \u03c3 m 1 \u2212\n\n4\n\n\u03c02\n\nQ|2n=l=0\n\n.\n\n(5.61)\n\nThis last expression is equal to 0.77 \u03c3 m if Q = Q\u22121 , but agrees with (5.60) if Q|n=l=0 \u2248 0.73\nis taken.\n5.3.5. Ultrarelativistic limit\nIn the ultrarelativistic limit, that is to say m = 0, the various elimination equations for\nthe auxiliary field and the energy formulae become simpler. Equation (5.38) is then written\nas\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\n\u03c3 \u03bb +1\nx0\nx0 \u2212 A\u03bb = 0,\n(5.62)\n4\nand the final energy spectrum is given by (using the non trivial solution of (5.62))\nM\u03bbur (a, \u03c3 , N) =\n\n1\n\u03bb\n\u03bb +1\n(a|\u03bb |) \u03bb +1 (\u03c3 Q) \u03bb +1 .\n\u03bb\n\n(5.63)\n\n\f60\nLet us stress that, in this special case, an analytical expression is obtained whatever the\npower \u03bb of the potential, in contrast to the particular values (5.41) resulting from the general\ncase. One can check that (5.45) and (5.51) reduce to (5.63) when m \u2192 0.\nThe quantity M\u03bbur is physically a mass. It appears that M\u03bbur < 0 when \u22121 < \u03bb < 0 and\nur = 0. No bound state of massless constituent particles can be found in these cases.\nM\u22121\nAlthough (5.63) is positive for \u22122 < \u03bb < \u22121, this range of values for \u03bb has been proved to\nbe unphysical.\n\u221a\nFor the particular case \u03bb = 1, this last formula becomes M1ur = 2 \u03c3 a Q, and one has\nconsequently (M1ur )2 \u221d Q. Such a linear behavior between the squared masses and the quantum numbers of the different states (with Q = Q1 for instance) is a well-known property of\nthe spinless Salpeter Hamiltonian with a linear potential and massless constituents. Such\na Hamiltonian is one of the simplest ways to describe a light meson in a potential approach of QCD, and it is experimentally checked that the square masses of the light mesons\nmainly grow linearly with their angular momentum (Regge trajectories). See for example\nRefs. 47), 82) for a discussion of that point.\nIt is worth looking at the ultrarelativistic harmonic oscillator. The energy spectrum of\nthe Hamiltonian\np\nhho = 2 p 2 + a r2\n(5.64)\ncan be analytically computed for l = 0 and reads83)\n\nMho = \u2212(4a)1/3 \u03b1n ,\n\n(5.65)\n\nwhere \u03b1n < 0 are the zeros of the regular Airy function (see Appendix G). Using (4.8),\n(5.65) reads\n\u00012/3\n\u221a\n.\n(5.66)\nMho = 3 a Q(1; n, 0)\nThis last expression can be compared to the AFM result (5.63) for \u03bb = \u03c3 = 2, i.e.\n\u221a \u00012/3\n.\nM2ur = 3 a Q\n\n(5.67)\n\nWith (5.64) as a starting point, a natural choice for Q is Q2 , but it is clear that both Mho\nand M2ur are identical provided that Q = Q(1; n, 0), the principal quantum number giving the\nexact energy formula in the case of a nonrelativistic kinetic energy with linear potential. The\nexplanation of this fact is that the Fourier transform of Hamiltonian (5.64) is a nonrelativistic\nHamiltonian with linear potential. This is a supplementary indication that Q should be\ndifferent in the semirelativistic and nonrelativistic cases for the same potential.\n5.3.6. Improved formulae for ultrarelativistic power-law potentials\nExactly as it was the case in the nonrelativistic framework, it is possible to improve\ndrastically the energy formulae of the spinless Salpeter simply by changing the value of the\nprincipal quantum number Q. To study this problem, we employ the scaling law properties\nand consider the dimensionless Hamiltonian valid for massless particles\np\nH = 2 p 2 + r\u03bb\n(5.68)\n\nwith \u03bb > 0. Very accurate numerical values for the eigensolutions of this Hamiltonian can\nbe obtained with the Lagrange mesh method.54)\n\n\f61\nThe approximate energy spectrum is given by (5.63) with a = 1 and \u03c3 = 2. With the\nchoice Q = Q2 = 2 n + l + 3/2, upper bounds are obtained. As mentioned before, another\nchoice for the n- and l-dependences of Q can greatly improve the results. By using the form\nQ = b(\u03bb ) n + d(\u03bb ) l + c(\u03bb ),\n\n(5.69)\n\nwe find smooth variations for coefficients b, c and d for \u03bb \u2208]0, 2] (l \u2264 3 and n \u2264 3). In\nparticular, d(\u03bb ) \u2248 1 with relative variations less than 2%. Coefficients b(\u03bb ) and c(\u03bb ) can\nbe fitted with various functions and similar agreement. Finally, we choose\nb(\u03bb ) =\n\n3.00 \u03bb + 3.67\n,\n\u03bb + 3.40\n\nc(\u03bb ) =\n\n2.69 \u03bb + 8.69\n,\n\u03bb + 8.27\n\nd(\u03bb ) = 1.\n\n(5.70)\n\nAgreement with exact results is very good but the variational character of the approximation\nis no longer guaranteed. With the choice (5.70), the maximal relative error for l \u2264 3 and\nn \u2264 3 and for \u03bb \u2208 [0.1, 2] is located between 0.3 and 1.1%. With the choice Q = Q2 , the\ncorresponding error is located between 4.5 and 12.7%. Just to give a quantitative idea of the\nquality of the approximation, results for \u03bb = 1 are presented in Table XI.\nTable XI.

By using the form\n(5.72)\n\nQ = b(a) n + d(a) l + c(a)\n\nand imposing b(0) = c(0) = d(0) = 1, we find smooth variations for coefficients b, c and d\nfor a \u2208]0, ac ] (l \u2264 3 and n \u2264 3).

With the\nchoice Q = Q\u22121 , the corresponding error is located between 0.004 and 17.3%. To obtain\na good accuracy in the domain a \u2248 ac = 4/\u03c0 \u2248 1.273, special method must be used as the\none presented in Ref. 81). To recover the value obtained for the ground state in this paper,\nit is necessary to have c(ac ) = 0.73. Our formula gives c(ac ) = 0.77. Results for a = 1 are\npresented in Table XII.\nOne can see that Q = Q\u22121 = n + l + 1 is a better choice for large values of n or l. This\ncan be understood as a kind of nonrelativistic behavior since the limits a \u2192 0 and Q \u2192 \u221e\nhave similar effects.\n\n\f63\n5.4. Square root potential\n\n\u221a\nIn Sect. 4.3, we introduced the square root potential V (r) = a2 r2 + b2 and commented\nits important role in the theoretical description of hybrid mesons in a nonrelativistic framework. Nevertheless, such a type of potential allied with a relativistic kinetic energy operator\nis important to describe hybrid mesons with low mass quarks as well. The general formula\nwith a non vanishing quark mass looks rather difficult and we prefer here to present the two\nextreme limits and show the close connection with the previous section through a Fourier\ntransform.\n\n5.4.1. Nonrelativistic kinematics\n\u221a\np2\nThe nonrelativistic limit follows from the Hamiltonian H = 2m\n+ a2 r2 + b2 and as\nbeen studied in Sect. 4.3. It is easy to show that the Fourier transform of this Hamiltonian,\ndenoted as H FT , reads\np\n(5.74)\nH FT = \u03c3 p 2 + M 2 + \u03ba r2 ,\nwith\n\n\u03c3=\n\n\u0012\n\n4a\nm2\n\n\u00131/3\n\n,\n\nM=\n\nb\n,\n\u03c3\n\n\u03ba =\u03c3\n\nma\n.\n8\n\n(5.75)\n\nThis last Hamiltonian is nothing else than a spinless Salpeter one (5.1) with a harmonic\npotential. Provided that the proper substitution rules are taken into account, the energy\nspectrum in this case is the same than the one computed in Sect. 5.3.2. We have thus\nr\n3 Y2 + 4G\u2212 (Y2 )\nnr\np\n(5.76)\nEsq = b\nY2 8G\u2212 (Y2 ) + 3Y2\nr \u0012\n\u0013\n2\nY2\n3\n=b\n(5.77)\n+\nY2 G\u2212 (Y2 ) 2G2\u2212 (Y2 )\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n2b\nG2\u2212 (Y2 ) +\n,\n(5.78)\n=\u221a\nG\u2212 (Y2 )\n3Y2\nwith\nb2\nY2 =\n3\n\n\u0012\n\n32 m\na2 Q2\n\n\u00132/3\n\n.\n\n(5.79)\n\nThis potential was studied in more detail in Sect. 4.3, and we recovered here the results\npresented there (see (4.26)). This remarkable result proves that AFM is an approximation\nconsistent with the Fourier transform.\n5.4.2. Ultrarelativistic limit\np In the\u221aultrarelativistic limit (m = 0), the corresponding Salpeter Hamiltonian is H =\n\u03c3 p 2 + a2 r2 + b2 . To get the eigenenergies, it is not necessary to start a new calculation.\nIn fact, the Fourier transform of H is simply\np\nH FT = \u03c3 p 2 + M 2 + a r,\n(5.80)\n\nwith M = b/\u03c3 . But this last Hamiltonian appears to be a spinless Salpeter one (5.1) with\na linear potential. Provided that the proper substitution rules are taken into account, the\n\n\f64\nenergy spectrum in this case is the same than the one computed in Sect. 5.3.3. We have thus\nr\n2 Y1 + 3F\u2212 (Y1 )\nur\np\n(5.81)\nMsq = b\nY1 3F\u2212 (Y1 ) + 2Y1\ns\n\u0012\n\u0013\nY1\n2\n=b\n3+\n(5.82)\nY1 F\u2212 (Y1 )\nF\u2212 (Y1 )\n\u0001\nb\n3 + F\u22122 (Y1 ) ,\n(5.83)\n=p\n2Y1 F\u2212 (Y1 )\nwith\n\n33/2 b2\n.\n2a \u03c3 Q\nWhen b \u2192 0, these last equations logically reduce to (5.63) with \u03bb = 1.\nY1 =\n\n(5.84)\n\n5.5. Funnel potential\nAs we stressed in Sect. 4.6.7, the funnel potential V (r) = ar \u2212 b/r, with a and b both\npositive, is of crucial importance in hadronic physics. It was shown that an analytical expression is available in a nonrelativistic framework. However the glueball resonances or the\nspectroscopy of very light mesons need a semirelativistic description and a spinless Salpeter\nequation governed with a funnel potential is the most economic way to consider this situation.\n5.5.1. Massless particle\nThe ultrarelativistic limit (m = 0), is particularly important for the description of a\nglueball composed of two massless gluons or a meson composed of two massless quarks.\nThen, the extremization condition (5.22) becomes ar02 + b = \u03c3 Q whose solution is\nr\n\u03c3Q \u2212 b\nr0 =\n.\n(5.85)\na\nInserting this value in the expression of the mass (5.23) leads to the mass formula\np\n(5.86)\nMfur = 2 a (\u03c3 Q \u2212 b).\nIt is astonishing that such a complicated potential used in conjunction with a semirelativistic\nkinetic energy admits\n\u221a analytical approximate eigenenergies of such simple form. For b = 0,\n(5.86) reduces to 2 a\u03c3 Q, that is the expected expression from (5.63) in the case \u03bb = 1.\nFor a = 0, M ur \u2192 0 as shown in Sect. 5.3.5. If the prescription Q = Q2 is chosen, then\n(5.86) is an upper bound on the exact result. As already mentioned, other choice for Q could\nimprove the accuracy of the formula but without guarantee about the variational character\nof the result. This point is studied in the next section.\n\n5.5.2. Improved formulae for the ultrarelativistic limit\nWritten with dimensionless variables, the ultrarelativistic Hamiltonian for two massless\nparticles interacting via the funnel potential is given by\np\n\u03b2\nh = 2 p2 + r \u2212\nr\n\n(5.87)\n\n\f65\nwith \u03b2 \u2265 0. The approximate energy spectrum is given by (5.86) with \u03c3 = 2, a = 1 and\nb replaced by \u03b2 (to avoid confusion with the coefficient of n). This kind of Hamiltonian\nis often used in hadronic physics with typical values for \u03b2 \u2248 0.4. Very accurate numerical\nvalues for the eigensolutions of this Hamiltonian can be obtained with the Lagrange mesh\nmethod.54)\nWith the choice Q = Q2 = 2 n + l + 3/2, upper bounds are obtained. As shown in\nprevious cases, another choice for the n- and l-dependences of Q can greatly improve the\nresults. By using the form\nQ = b(\u03b2 ) n + d(\u03b2 ) l + c(\u03b2 ),\n(5.88)\nwe find smooth variations for coefficients b, c and d for \u03b2 \u2208 [0, 1] (l \u2264 3 and n \u2264 3). These\ncoefficients can be fitted with various functions and similar agreement. Finally, we choose\nb(\u03b2 ) =\n\n1.88 \u03b2 \u2212 5.34\n,\n\u03b2 \u2212 3.51\n\nc(\u03b2 ) =\n\n1.99 \u03b2 \u2212 4.40\n,\n\u03b2 \u2212 3.49\n\nd(\u03b2 ) =\n\n0.76 \u03b2 \u2212 2.46\n.\n\u03b2 \u2212 2.54\n\n(5.89)\n\nAgreement with exact results is very good but the variational character of the approximation\nis no longer guaranteed. With the choice (5.89), the maximal relative error for l \u2264 3 and\nn \u2264 3 and for \u03b2 \u2208 [0, 1] is located between 0.6 and 4.9%. With the choice Q = Q2 , the\ncorresponding error is located between 12.7 and 42.2%. Results for \u03b2 = 0.4 are presented\nin Table XIII.\nFor \u03b2 = 0, one obtains b = 1.52, c = 1.26, and d = 1.09. From (5.70) with \u03bb = 1, one\nobtains b = 1.52, c = 1.23, and d = 1. These values are close to each other as expected.\nTable XIII. Eigenvalues \u03b5 (n, l) of the Hamiltonian (5.87) with \u03b2 = 0.4, for some sets (n, l).

We have checked that (5.86) [with \u03c3 = 1, a = 1 and b = \u03b2 ]\nis recovered in the limit \u03c7 \u2192 0. It can also be checked that (5.97) and (4.109) [with \u03c3 = 1,\nm = \u03c7 , a = 1 and b = \u03b2 ] tend towards the same limit when \u03c7 \u2192 \u221e.\n5.5.4. Low mass expression\n\u221a\nBy\np a \"small mass\", we mean the condition m \u226a a. For m = 0, we saw already that\nr0 = (\u03c3 Q \u2212 b)/a.

Unequal masses\nSome particular problems require to deal with a system of two particles with unequal\nmasses. In this case, a general spinless Salpeter Hamiltonian is given in the rest frame by\nq\nq\n(5.101)\nH = p 2 + m21 + p 2 + m22 +V (r).\n\nA general result can be obtained for Hamiltonians with two different masses. Let us\nconsider the following two-body Hamiltonians H = T1 + T2 + V , H1 = 2T1 + V , and H2 =\n2T2 + V whose ground-state energies are respectively M = h\u03c6 |H|\u03c6 i, M1 = h\u03c61 |H1 |\u03c61 i, and\nM2 = h\u03c62 |H2 |\u03c62 i. Since H = (H1 + H2 )/2, we can write\nh\u03c6 |H|\u03c6 i =\n\n1\n(h\u03c6 |H1 |\u03c6 i + h\u03c6 |H2 |\u03c6 i) .\n2\n\n(5.102)\n\nThe Ritz theorem implies that\n1\n(M1 + M2 ) .\n(5.103)\n2\nFor particular cases, this approximation can be quite good. In Ref. 84), it is shown that M \u2248\n\u221a\n(M1 + M2 )/2 for a relativistic Hamiltonian of kind (5.101) with V (r) = a r and mi \u226a a.\nThe square roots appearing in the kinetic terms can still be treated by resorting to the\nAFM. But this time, two auxiliary fields, \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 , have to be introduced. One is led to the\nHamiltonian\nM\u2265\n\nH\u0303(\u03bc1 , \u03bc2 ) =\n\nm2\np2\n\u03bc1 + \u03bc2 m21\n+ 2 +\n+\n2\n2\u03bc1 2\u03bc2 2M\u0304(\u03bc1 , \u03bc2 )\n+sgn(\u03bb )\u03bd r\u03bb +V (J(\u03bd )) \u2212 sgn(\u03bb )\u03bd J(\u03bd )\u03bb ,\n\nwith\n\n(5.104)\n\n\u03bc1 \u03bc2\n(5.105)\n\u03bc1 + \u03bc2\nplaying the role of a reduced mass. It has\nq been shown\nq in Ref. 85) that the AFM leads to the\n2\nsystem (5.30)-(5.32), but with T (x) = x2 + m + x2 + m2 .\nM\u0304(\u03bc1 , \u03bc2 ) =\n\n1\n\n2\n\nIt is then easy to obtain numerical upper bounds, but one can wonder if it is possible to\nobtain analytical solutions? Due to the presence of the square roots, it is only conceivable\nwith very special conditions: one mass is vanishing (m1 = 0 and m2 = m) and the potential\n\n\f68\nis well chosen. Analytical solutions can be obtained for the funnel potential, often used in\nhadronic physics.85) Let us note that an analytical upper bound for a logarithmic potential\n(also relevant in hadronic physics) can also be computed.\nThe solution for the general funnel potential is very complicated. As an illustration,\nthe case of the Coulomb interaction, \u2212a/r, is only presented here. The solution for the\nassociated system (5.30)-(5.32) gives\np\nQ a(2Q \u2212 a)\nr0 =\n(5.106)\nm\na\u2212Q\nand\nM = 2m\n\ns\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\na\na\n1\u2212\n.\n2Q\n2Q\n\n(5.107)\n\nThis formula is an upper bound if Q = n + l + 1, but, as we pointed out several times, it is\njustified to take a more sophisticated expression in order to get a better accuracy. It can be\nseen from (5.107) that limm\u21920 M = 0, as expected.\nFrom equations above, a solution M exists only when the following condition is verified:\na\n< Q < a.\n2\n\n(5.108)\n\nThe right part of this inequality corresponds to the cancellation of the binding (M \u2192 m\nwhen Q \u2192 a), and the left part corresponds to a collapse (M \u2192 0 when Q \u2192 a/2). Indeed,\nthe mean radius r0 \u2192 \u221e when Q \u2192 a, and r0 \u2192 0 when Q \u2192 a/2. A sufficiently strong\ninteraction must exist to bind the system, but unphysical values of the mass could appear\nif it is too strong. With the Coulomb potential, the nonrelativistic limit is not defined by\nm \u2192 \u221e but by a \u2192 0. So, (5.108) implies that this limit is irrelevant for the solution (5.107).\n5.7. Semiclassical interpretation\nA semiclassical interpretation of the system (5.30)-(5.32) is also possible. Let us assume a classical circular motion for the two particles, as illustrated in Fig. 4. In this case,\nthe force Fi acting on particle i is given by\nFi = mi \u03b3 (vi )\n\ndvi\ndt\n\nwith\n\ndvi v2i\n= .\ndt\nri\n\n(5.109)\n\nTaking into account that both particles are characterized by the same momentum p0 , This\nequation becomes\np2\n1\n.\n(5.110)\nFi = q 0\nr\n2\n2\ni\np +m\n0\n\ni\n\nThe rigid rotation constraint, v1 /r1 = v2 /r2 , implies that\nq\nq\np20 + m21 + p20 + m22\nq\n,\nr0 = r1 + r2 = ri\np20 + m2j\n\n(5.111)\n\n\f69\nwith i 6= j. If the force acting on i comes from the potential V (r) generated by j, then\nF1 = F2 = V \u2032 (r0 ). (5.110) and (5.111) can be recast onto the form (5.32), and it is obvious\nthan (5.30) gives the mass of the system. The total orbital angular momentum is r1 p0 +\nr2 p0 = r0 p0 . A semiclassical quantification gives thus r0 p0 = L + 1/2, and we obtain a\nsystem very similar to (5.30)-(5.32). Nevertheless, the AFM produces more general results.\n\nFig. 4. Classical circular motion of the two relativistic particles.\n\n\u00a76. N-body problems\n\nUp to now, the AFM was applied essentially to one- and two-body systems with either a nonrelativistic or a relativistic kinetic energy operator. It was shown that, in many\nsituations, the method was able to provide an accurate analytical expression for the corresponding eigenenergies. In this section we address the important point of whether AFM\nis also able to give informations concerning the eigenenergies of a system composed of N\nparticles. Except the very special case of particles whose dynamics is governed by quadratic\ninteractions, which is treated in detail in Appendix J, no analytical solution is known for\nN-body systems. Nevertheless a number of very interesting physical problems need to solve\na N-body equation. As in the 2-body case, the AFM cannot pretend to give a very high\naccuracy in the results, but it exhibits the interesting virtue to clearly show the dependence\nof the results in terms of the physical parameters and the various quantum numbers.\nIndeed, the envelope theory was used in the N-body problem to find bounds for the nonrelativistic binding energies if the two-body potential fulfills certain restrictive conditions.86)\nIn this section, we apply AFM to the N-body problem in a more general context\n\u2022 we consider the possibility of dealing with a semirelativistic kinetic energy potential;\n\u2022 we allow the presence of one-body terms in addition to two-body interactions.\nMoreover, we are not interested only by the existence of bounds which can sometimes\ngive rather poor values, but the purpose of the present section is to show that the AFM can\nbe successfully applied to find approximate analytical mass formulae for general relativistic\n\n\f70\nN-body Hamiltonians of the form\nN q\nN\nH = \u2211 p 2i + m2i + \u2211 Ui (|rr i \u2212 R |) +\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nN\n\n\u2211\n\ni< j=1\n\n(6.1)\n\nVi j (|rr i \u2212 r j |),\n\nwith \u2211Ni=1 p i = P = 0 , where r i and p i are respectively the position and momentum of particle i with a mass mi , and where R is a global variable defined in Appendix I. As stated,\nwe consider a relativistic kinematics and allow for both pairwise V and one-body U interactions. Particular systems exhibiting one-body potentials of the previous form will be studied\nbelow. Most of the material of this section can be found in Ref. 68).\nA quantity which appears very often in this section is the number of interacting particles. In order to simplify the notations, we use a special symbol to designate this number\nand set\nN(N \u2212 1)\nCN =\n.\n(6.2)\n2\n6.1. Main mass formulae\n6.1.1. General case\nAs stated, the AFM can be straightforwardly generalized to the case of N-body Hamiltonians of the form (6.1). The basic idea is to introduce auxiliary fields so that this Hamiltonian is formally replaced by a Hamiltonian for which an analytical solution can eventually\nbe found. The auxiliary fields are denoted as \u03bci , \u03bdi , and \u03c1i j , and are introduced as follows\n\u0015 N\nN \u0014\np 2i\n\u03bci m2i\nH(\u03bck , \u03bdk , \u03c1kl ) = \u2211\n+\n+ \u2211 [\u03bdi P(ri ) +Ui(Ii (\u03bdi )) \u2212 \u03bdi P(Ii (\u03bdi ))]\n+\n2\u03bci 2\u03bci\ni=1\ni=1 2\nN\n\n+\n\n\u2211\n\ni< j=1\n\n[\u03c1i j S(ri j ) +Vi j (Ji j (\u03c1i j )) \u2212 \u03c1i j S(Ji j (\u03c1i j ))] ,\n\n(6.3)\n\nwhere (notice the definition of ri 6= |rr i |)\nri = |rr i \u2212 R |,\n\n(6.4)\n\nri j = |rr i \u2212 r j |,\n\nand where\nIi (x) = Ki\u22121 (x),\n\nKi (x) =\n\nUi\u2032 (x)\n,\nP\u2032 (x)\n\nJi j (x) = L\u22121\ni j (x),\n\nLi j (x) =\n\nVi\u2032j (x)\n,\nS\u2032 (x)\n\n(6.5)\n\nwhere the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the argument. It is sufficient to set\n\u03bck = mk \u2200k to treat a nonrelativistic kinematics. We stress that, in order for the AFM to\napply, it is assumed that the mass spectrum of (6.3) is analytically computable. In practice,\nthis is only possible for the choice P(x) = S(x) = x2 under some conditions (see Appendix J).\nThe reason of such a definition is that Hamiltonians (6.1) and (6.3) are equivalent if the\nauxiliary fields are properly eliminated. It can indeed be checked that\nq\n\u03b4\u03bci H(\u03bck , \u03bdk , \u03c1kl ) \u03bci =\u03bc\u0302i = 0 \u21d2 \u03bc\u0302i = p 2i + m2i ,\n(6.6)\n= 0 \u21d2 \u03bd\u0302i = Ki (ri ),\n(6.7)\n\u03b4\u03bdi H(\u03bck , \u03bdk , \u03c1kl )|\n\u03bdi =\u03bd\u0302i\n\n\u03b4\u03c1i j H(\u03bck , \u03bdk , \u03c1kl )\n\n\u03c1i j =\u03c1\u0302i j\n\n= 0 \u21d2 \u03c1\u0302i j = Li j (ri j ),\n\n(6.8)\n\n\f71\nand finally that H(\u03bc\u0302k , \u03bd\u0302k , \u03c1\u0302kl ) = H.\nThe approximation underlying the AFM is now that, as we have done in previous sections, the auxiliary fields will be seen as real variational parameters. Let us note\nH(\u03bck,0 , \u03bdk,0 , \u03c1kl,0 )|\u03c60 i = M0 |\u03c60 i,\n\n(6.9)\n\nwhere \u03bck,0 , \u03bdk,0 , \u03c1kl,0 are the real values of the auxiliary fields such that M0 is extremal.\n|\u03c60 i is an eigenstate with fixed quantum numbers and a given symmetry. Using the same\nmathematical techniques than in Sect. 2, one can show that\nq\n(6.10)\n\u03bck,0 = h\u03c60 |pp2i + m2i |\u03c60 i with P = 0 ,\nh\u03c60 |P(ri )|\u03c60 i = P(ri,0 ) with ri,0 = Ii (\u03bdi,0 ),\n(6.11)\nh\u03c60 |S(ri j )|\u03c60 i = S(ri j,0 ) with ri j,0 = Ji j (\u03c1i j,0 ).\n(6.12)\n2 ,\nUsing the Hellmann-Feynman theorem,39) it can be shown that h\u03c60 |\u03bc\u0302i2 |\u03c60 i = \u03bci,0\nh\u03c60 |P(Ii (\u03bd\u0302i ))|\u03c60 i = P(Ii (\u03bdi,0 )) and h\u03c60 |S(Ji j (\u03c1\u0302i j ))|\u03c60 i = S(Ji j (\u03c1i j,0 )). Let us rewrite the\nHamiltonian (6.3) under the form\nN\n\nH(\u03bck , \u03bdk , \u03c1kl ) = T (\u03bck ) + \u2211 \u0168i (\u03bdi , ri ) +\ni=1\n\nN\n\n\u2211\n\n\u1e7ci j (\u03c1i , ri j ),\n\n(6.13)\n\ni< j=1\n\nwhere T (\u03bck ) stands for the kinetic part. One can also check that\n\u0168i (\u03bdi,0 , ri,0 ) = U (ri,0 ), \u0168i\u2032 (\u03bdi,0 , ri,0 ) = U \u2032 (ri,0 ),\n\u1e7ci j (\u03c1i j,0 , ri j,0 ) = V (ri j,0 ), \u1e7ci\u2032j (\u03c1i j,0 , ri j,0 ) = V \u2032 (ri j,0 ).\n\n(6.14)\n(6.15)\n\nThis means that the approximate potential \u0168i (\u1e7ci j ) and the corresponding genuine potential\nUi (Vi j ) are tangent at, at least, one point. If the following conditions \u0168i (\u03bdi,0 , ri ) \u2265 U (ri )\nand \u1e7ci j (\u03c1i j,0 , ri j ) \u2265 V (ri j ) are fulfilled \u2200i and \u2200 j and for all values of the radial arguments,\nM0 is an upper bound on an eigenstate of H (6.1). If the kinematics is non relativistic\n(T = T (\u03bck = mk )) and if the following conditions \u0168i (\u03bdi,0 , ri ) \u2264 U (ri ) and \u1e7ci j (\u03c1i j,0 , ri j ) \u2264\nV (ri j ) are fulfilled \u2200i and \u2200 j and for all values of the radial argument, M0 is a lower bound\non an eigenstate of H. This restriction about T comes from the fact that the replacement\nof the genuine relativistic kinetic operator by the form T (\u03bck ) yields upper bounds on the\neigenvalues of the genuine Hamiltonian. In the other cases, it is not possible to obtain a\nrelevant information about the position of M0 .\nAt this stage, approximate numerical solutions of the N-body problem can be easily\ncomputed. First, the choice P(x) = S(x) = x2 allows a precise determination of the eigenvalues of Hamiltonian (6.3) (see Appendix J). From now on, this choice is adopted for the\nrest of this section. Second, the extremization of the eigenvalues with respect to the real\nauxiliary fields is a classical numerical problem which can be solved with a high accuracy.\n6.1.2. Identical particles\nTo obtain analytical closed solutions of the eigenvalue and extremization problems associated to Hamiltonian (6.3), it is necessary to simplify the system. First of all, we will only\nconsider systems with identical particles, that is with mi = m. In this case, it is reasonable to\n\n\f72\nconsider identical interactions between them, namely Uk (x) = U (x) and Vkl (x) = V (x). This\nmeans that Kk (x) = K(x), Ik (x) = I(x), Lkl (x) = L(x), and Jkl (x) = J(x). The global variable\nR (see (I.1)) is then the center of mass of the system, even for relativistic kinematics.\nLet us denote P\u0302i j the permutation operator exchanging particles i and j. We can write\nP\u0302i j |\u03c60 i = \u00b1|\u03c60 i if this state |\u03c60 i is completely (anti)symmetrical. Then\nP(r j,0 ) = h\u03c60 |P(r j )|\u03c60 i = h\u03c60 |P\u0302i j P(ri )P\u0302i j |\u03c60 i = h\u03c60 |P(ri )|\u03c60 i = P(ri,0 ).\n\n(6.16)\n\nIf P(x) is monotonic, which is always the case in practice, then r j,0 = ri,0 . Finally, if I(x) is\ninvertible, which must be the case to solve the problem, we have \u03bdi,0 = K(ri,0 ) = K(r j,0 ) =\n\u03bd j,0 . So all optimal values \u03bdi,0 are the same. Using the same reasoning, we can draw the\nsame conclusion for other auxiliary fields.\nUnder these conditions, we can set \u03bci = \u03bc , \u03bdi = \u03bd , and \u03c1i j = \u03c1 in the expression of the\neigenenergies. We are thus led to replace the original Hamiltonian (6.3) by the following\nsimpler Hamiltonian, which now depends on only 3 auxiliary fields (remember that P(x) =\nS(x) = x2 )\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u0002\nN\nm2\nH(\u03bc , \u03bd , \u03c1 ) =\n\u03bc+\n+ N U (I(\u03bd )) \u2212 \u03bd I(\u03bd )2 +CN V (J(\u03c1 )) \u2212 \u03c1 J(\u03c1 )2\n2\n\u03bc\nN\n\nN\nN\np 2i\n+ \u03bd \u2211 ri2 + \u03c1 \u2211 ri2j ,\ni=1 2\u03bc\ni=1\ni< j=1\n\n+\u2211\n\n(6.17)\n\nP = 0)\nwhich, by virtue of (J.16), has the following mass spectrum (P\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0002\nN\nm2\nM(\u03bc , \u03bd , \u03c1 ) =\n\u03bc+\n+ N U (I(\u03bd )) \u2212 \u03bd I(\u03bd )2 +CN V (J(\u03c1 )) \u2212 \u03c1 J(\u03c1 )2\n2\n\u03bc\ns\n2\n(\u03bd + N \u03c1 ) Q\n(6.18)\n+\n\u03bc\nN\u22121\n\nwith Q =\n\n3\n\n\u2211 (2ni + li) + 2 (N \u2212 1),\n\n(6.19)\n\ni=1\n\nwhich is characterized by a high degeneracy due to the form of the principal quantum number Q.\nThe last step needed to get the final mass formula is to find the optimal values \u03bc0 , \u03bd0 ,\nand \u03c10 from the extremization conditions\n\n\u2202\u03bc M(\u03bc , \u03bd , \u03c1 )\n\n\u03bc = \u03bc0\n\n= 0, \u2202\u03bd M(\u03bc , \u03bd , \u03c1 )|\u03bd =\u03bd0 = 0, \u2202\u03c1 M(\u03bc , \u03bd , \u03c1 )\n\n\u03c1 =\u03c10\n\n= 0.\n\n(6.20)\n\nWriting explicitly (6.20) and after some algebra, we arrive at the mass formula\nM(\u03bc0 , \u03bd0 , \u03c10 ) = N \u03bc0 + N U (I(\u03bd0 )) +CNV (J(\u03c10 )),\n\n(6.21)\n\nwhere the auxiliary fields are solutions of\n\u0014 2\n\u00151/2\n2Q (\u03bd0 + N \u03c10)\nm2\n+\n,\n\u03bc0 =\n\u03bc0\n\u03bc0 N 2\n\n(6.22)\n\n\f73\n\u00151/4\nQ2\nI(\u03bd0 ) =\n,\n2N 2 \u03bc0 (\u03bd0 + N \u03c10 )\n\u0014\n\u00151/4\n2Q2\nJ(\u03c10 ) =\n.\n(N \u2212 1)2 \u03bc0 (\u03bd0 + N \u03c10)\n\u0014\n\n(6.23)\n(6.24)\n\nAt this stage, functions I and J are not known. They depend on the specific forms of U and\nV . Optimal values of \u03bc0 , \u03bd0 , and \u03c10 are not known anymore. Moreover, they also depend\non the state considered through the variable Q. Nevertheless, formula (6.21) makes clearly\nappear the mean-field nature of the AFM, because \u03bc0 can be interpreted as the average\nkinetic energy of one particle, while U (I(\u03bd0 )) and V (J(\u03c10 )) can be respectively seen as the\naverage potential energy of one particle in the potential U (r) and of a pair in the potential\nV (r).\nA general remark about the AFM can now be done: The analytical results obtained for\na given potential U (r) approximated by a potential P(r) can be used as a starting point for\nfinding analytical results for an other potential W (r), approximated this time by U (r). The\nsame procedure can be applied for the potential V (r). This considerably enlarges the domain\nof applicability of this method.\nNotice that the idea of rewriting a N-body Hamiltonian with pairwise interactions of\nthe form g(ri2j ) as a N-body harmonic oscillator has already been investigated in Ref. 87)\nwithin the framework of the envelope theory. That method shares many similarities with the\nauxiliary field method, as shown in Appendix A, but the results presented hereafter have, to\nour knowledge, be presented for the first time in Ref. 68).\n6.1.3. Simplified formulations\nThe four equations (6.21)\u2013(6.24) give the AFM approximation for the mass spectrum of\na N-body system where the constituent particles are identical. They can be even simplified\nby defining\np\nX0 = 2\u03bc0 (\u03bd0 + N \u03c10 ).\n(6.25)\nWe have indeed\n\nM(X0 ) = N\n\nr\n\nQ\nm2 + X0 + N U\nN\n\nr\n\nQ\nNX0\n\n!\n\n+CNV\n\ns\n\n2Q\n(N \u2212 1)X0\n\nwhere the remaining auxiliary field is a solution of\ns\n\"\n!\n!#\nr\nr\nQ\n2Q\nQ\n2\nX0 = 2 m2 + X0 K\n+NL\n,\nN\nNX0\n(N \u2212 1)X0\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(6.26)\n\n(6.27)\n\nand where K(x) = U \u2032 (x)/(2x) and L(x) = V \u2032 (x)/(2x) (see (6.5)). This condition ensures\nthat M(X0 ) is extremal. In so doing, we have simplified a lot the original formulation.\nThe set (6.22)-(6.24) is a complicated system of non linear coupled equations, while the\nequivalent formulation (6.27) is just a transcendental equation which is a priori easier to be\nsolved. As we shall see in the next sections, this task can be achieved in several cases of\ninterest. It is worth mentioning that the AFM results (6.26) and (6.27) are valid not only for\nthe ground state but also for excited states.\n\n\f74\nFor particles with null mass (ultrarelativistic limit), one obtains even simpler formulae\nby simply setting m = 0 in formulae (6.26) and (6.27). In the nonrelativistic limit, the\nauxiliary field \u03bc tends towards m. In this case also the various formulae look simpler but\ncautions must be taken in the limit.

This generalizes the relations found previously for two-body systems.\nAs one could expect, the kinetic energy and the one-body potential energy are proportional\nto the number of particles and the two-body potential energy is proportional to the number\nof pairs. Formula (6.30) looks like a semiclassical approximation but this is absolutely not\nthe case. The AFM yields an approximate N-body wavefunction,68), 89), 90) and the relation\n(6.31) between p0 and r0 is a full quantum link, function of the quantum numbers of the\nsystem. Lastly, the value of r0 (and thus of p0 ) is the solution of a transcendental equation\n(6.32) which is the translation into the AFM variables of the generalized virial theorem59)\nwhich comes from very general properties of quantum mechanics. These considerations\nprove that the AFM really relies on very sound physical basis. Once the system (6.30)(6.32) is written, it can appear finally quite natural to obtain such a result. The problem is to\nfind a relevant link between the mean values r0 and p0 . This is solved by the AFM.\nThe eigenstates of H(\u03bc0 , \u03bd0 , \u03c10 ) are built with harmonic oscillator states. A N-body\nstate with a mass M(X0 ) is written\n\n\u03c8=\n\nN\u22121\n\n\u220f \u03c8n l (\u03bb j , x j ),\nj j\n\n(6.33)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere \u03c8n j l j (\u03bb j , x j ) is a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator wavefunction (see Appendix E), depending on the Jacobi coordinate x j (see Appendix I) and decreasing asymp2 2\ntotically like e\u2212\u03bb j x j /2 (the magnetic quantum number is omitted). The quantum numbers\n\n\f75\n3\nare such that \u2211N\u22121\nj=1 (2n j + l j ) = B = Q \u2212 2 (N \u2212 1) and the scale parameters \u03bb j are given by\ns\ns\ns\n1\nj\nj\nj N\n\u03bbj =\nX0 =\nNQ =\np0 .\n(6.34)\nj+1\nj+1\nr0\nj+1 Q\n\nThe quantum number B is generally called the band number. The state (6.33) has neither a\ndefined total angular momentum nor a good symmetry, but its is characterized by a parity\n(\u22121)B . By combining states (6.33) with the same value of B (or Q), it is generally possible\nto build a physical state with good quantum numbers and good symmetry properties, but the\ntask can be technically very complicated.91) Some observables can be easily computed:\n+\n*\n1 N 2\n(6.35)\n\u2211 p i = p20 ,\nN i=1\n+\n+ *\n*\nN\nN\n(6.36)\nN \u2211 ri2 =\n\u2211 ri2j = r02 .\ni=1\n\ni< j=1\n\nSince these results only depend on the quantum numbers via Q, and since a physical state\nmust be a combination of eigenstates with the same value of Q, formulae (6.35) and (6.36)\nare also valid for a physical state. This shows that r0 can be considered as a mean radius for\nthe system and p0 as a mean momentum per particle. Indeed, (6.35) and (6.36) imply that\nrD E\nq\nq\nr0\nr\n0\nri2j = \u221a ,\n(6.37)\np 2i = p0 ,\nri2 = ,\nN\nCN\n\nfor arbitrary i 6= j since the mean values are taken with completely symmetrized states.\nThese results can also be obtained using the more general relations (6.10)-(6.12) relevant\nfor P(x) and S(x) different from x2 . Identifying (6.21) and (6.30), it appears that\nq\n\u03bc0 = m2 + p20 .\n(6.38)\n\nIn the above expression, Q is the principal quantum number defined in (6.19). However,\nit has been shown many times for the two-body problem that a much better approximation\nof the exact energies can be obtained with a slight modification of the principal quantum\nnumber. A particularly simple form which seems to work quite well for N-body systems is\ngiven by\nN\u22121\n\nQ=\n\n\u2211 (\u03b1 ni + \u03b2 li) + \u03b3 (N \u2212 1).\n\n(6.39)\n\ni=1\n\nFor instance, such a formula is tested numerically for baryons in Sect. 6.4.3; it improves\nsubstantially the results as compared to the expression (6.19). It is worth noting that there\nis no systematic procedure to determine the values of parameters \u03b1 , \u03b2 and \u03b3 , which depend\non both the interaction and the kinematics.\n6.2. Critical constants\nSome interactions, as the exponential or the Yukawa potentials, admit only a finite\nnumber of bound states (see Sects. 4.4.2 and 4.5.2). Let us assume that such an interaction\n\n\f76\ncan be written as W (x) = \u2212\u03ba w(x), where \u03ba is a positive quantity which has the dimension\nof an energy and w(x) a \"globally positive\" dimensionless function such that limx\u2192\u221e w(x) =\n0. The critical constant \u03ba ({\u03b8 }), where {\u03b8 } stands for a set of quantum numbers, is such\nthat, if \u03ba > \u03ba ({\u03b8 }), the potential admits a bound state with the quantum numbers {\u03b8 }.\nThe interaction energy for the state with quantum numbers {\u03b8 } is then just vanishing for\n\u03ba = \u03ba ({\u03b8 }).66)\nLet us consider a nonrelativistic N-body system (no manageable calculation can be\nperformed for a semirelativistic kinematics) with one-body potentials U (x) = \u2212k u(x) and\ntwo-body potentials V (x) = \u2212g v(x), both independent of the particle mass and both admitting only a finite number of bound states.

So, (6.44) gives precise information about the dependence of\nthe many-body critical constant gN as a function of all the characteristics of the system. With\nthe system (6.44)-(6.45), it is easy to recover previous AFM results obtained in Sects. 4.4.2\nand 4.5.2, and in Refs. 67), 68).\nWithin the AFM approximation, the ground state (GS) of a boson-like system is characterized by Q = 23 (N \u2212 1).

Again, (6.48) gives precise information about the dependence of the one-body critical constant kN as a function of all the\ncharacteristics of the system. These results are strongly different from those for pairwise\nforces.\nIf the AFM gives upper (lower) bounds for the exact eigenvalues, the critical constants\npredicted by formulae above are upper (lower) bounds for the exact critical constants. In the\nfavorable situation where the AFM gives both upper and lower bounds for the eigenvalues,\nit is possible to approximate from above and below the exact critical constants.\n6.3. Connection with the perturbation theory\nIt has been shown in Ref. 40) that, for one- and two-body nonrelativistic systems, the\nAFM and the perturbation theory give similar results when the potential is an exactly solvable one plus a small perturbation. This result is extended here for the general Hamiltonian\n(6.1).88)\nLet us first assume that each pairwise potential V (ri j ) is supplemented by a term \u03b5 v(ri j ),\nwith \u03b5 \u226a 1 in order that \u03b5 v(x) \u226a V (x) in the physical domain of interest. In the system\n(6.30)-(6.32), the potential V (x) is replaced by V (x) + \u03b5 v(x). In this case, new values r1 and\np1 for the mean radius and momentum will be the solution of the new system\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0010r \u0011\nr1\nr1\n1\nM1 = N T (p1 ) + N U\n+\u03b5v \u221a\n,\n(6.50)\n+CN V \u221a\nN\nCN\nCN\np1 r1 = Q,\n(6.51)\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0010r \u0011 p\nr1\nr1\n1\nN p1 T \u2032 (p1 ) = r1U \u2032\n+ \u03b5 v\u2032 \u221a\n.\n(6.52)\n+ CN r1 V \u2032 \u221a\nN\nCN\nCN\n\nWriting r1 = (1 + \u03b4 )r0 , we can expect \u03b4 \u226a 1 since \u03b5 \u226a 1. In this case, power expansions at first order can be computed. We have p1 \u2248 (1 \u2212 \u03b4 )p0 from (6.51), and\nwe can write T (p1 ) \u2248 T (p0 ) \u2212 \u03b4 p0 T \u2032 (p0 ), T \u2032 (p1 ) \u2248 T \u2032 (p0 ) \u2212 \u03b4 p0 T \u2032\u2032 (p0 ), U (r1 /N) \u2248\nU (r0 /N) + \u03b4 r0 U \u2032 (r0 /N)/N, etc. Equation (6.52) reduces to an expression of the form\n\u03b4 \u2248 \u03b5 h(r0 ) where h is a quite complicated function of T \u2032 , U \u2032 , V \u2032 and their derivatives. It\nsimply confirms that \u03b4 \u223c O(\u03b5 ). It is then possible to perform an expansion of M1 which\nreduces, using (6.30) and (6.32), simply to88)\n\u0013\n\u0012\nr0\n+ O(\u03b5 2 ).\n(6.53)\nM1 = M0 +CN \u03b5 v \u221a\nCN\n\n\f78\nThis result could seem quite obvious, but it demonstrates that the knowledge of r0 is sufficient to obtain the contribution of the perturbation at the first order.\nLet us now assume too that each [one-body potential U (|ssi |) / kinetic operator T (|ppi |)]\nis supplemented by a term [\u03b7 u(|ssi |) / \u03c4 t(|ppi |)], with [\u03b7 \u226a 1 / \u03c4 \u226a 1] in order that [\u03b7 u(x) \u226a\nU (x) / \u03c4 t(x) \u226a T (x)] in the physical domain of interest. With similar calculations, we finally\nfind\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0010r \u0011\nr0\n0\n+ O(\u03c4 2 , \u03b7 2 , \u03b5 2 ).\n+CN \u03b5 v \u221a\n(6.54)\nM1 = M0 + N \u03c4 t (p0 ) + N \u03b7 u\nN\nCN\nThe parameter \u03b4 is determined at the same order by the following relation\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0010 \u0011 p\nr0\n\u2032\n\u2032 r0\n\u2032\nN p0 \u03c4 t (p0 ) \u2212 r0 \u03b7 u\n\u2212 CN r0 \u03b5 v \u221a\nN\nCN\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0010\n2\nr0 \u2032\u2032 r0 \u0011 2 \u2032\u2032\nr0\n\u2032\n2 \u2032\u2032\n\u221a\n= \u03b4 2 N p0 T (p0 ) + N p0 T (p0 ) + U\n.\n+ r0 V\nN\nN\nCN\n\n(6.55)\n\nPerturbed observables and wavefunctions can then be computed at first order, since r1 =\n(1 + \u03b4 )r0 and p1 = (1 \u2212 \u03b4 )p0 at this order.\nThe contribution of a perturbation at the first order can thus be very easily computed\nwithin the AFM once the unperturbed problem is solved. In order to check the quality of this\napproximation, let us consider a case in which the unperturbed Hamiltonian H can be solved\nexactly by the AFM, that is M0 is the exact solution. If the small perturbation potential is\nwritten \u03b5 \u2211Ni< j=1 v(ri j ), the quantum perturbation theory says that the solution M\u2217 is given\nby\n(6.56)\nM\u2217 = M0 +CN \u03b5 hv(ri j )i + O(\u03b5 2 ),\nfor any pair (i j). The mean value is taken with a completely symmetrized eigenstate of\n.\n.\nthe unperturbed Hamiltonian\n\u221a \u0001 H. The comparison of (6 56) with (6 53) shows that hv(ri j )i\nis replaced by v \u221ar0 / \u0001CN within the AFM. This is to be compared with the exact relation\nhS(ri j )i = S r0 / CN for the auxiliary potential (see (6.12)). So, the AFM does not give the\nsame result as the perturbation theory. But the agreement can be very good, as shown with\nseveral examples calculated above. Similar discussions can be made for small one-body\nperturbation potentials or small perturbations of the kinematics.\n6.4. Power-law potentials\n6.4.1.

When\nonly a one-body or a two-body interaction is present, parameters a or b must be positive.\nIf both types of potentials are present, there are less constraints on the sign provided that\n\n\f79\na bound state can exist. Following the definitions (6.5), it is readily computed that K(x) =\na |\u03bb | x\u03bb \u22122 /2 and L(x) = b |\u03b7 | x\u03b7 \u22122 /2.

This is possible if this last equation can be rewritten as a polynomial equation of\nthe fourth degree at most.

The\nCoulomb problem, i.e. \u03bb = \u22121, will be specifically considered in Sect. 6.4.4, while we will\ndiscuss the case \u03bb = 1 in Sect. 6.4.2. Notice that closed mass formulae for any \u03bb can be\nobtained in the nonrelativistic and ultrarelativistic limits, as we also show in the following.\nIn the case m = 0, (6.63) allows us to extract the X0 value for arbitrary power\nX0 =\n\n\u0012\n\nQ\n(A + B\u03bb )2\nN \u03bb\n\n\u0013\n\n1\n\u03bb +1\n\n.\n\n(6.65)\n\n\f80\nInserting this value in (6.64) provides us with the expression of the energy in the ultrarelativistic limit\ni 1\n\u03bb + 1 h \u03bb +2 \u03bb\n2(\u03bb +1)\n.\n(6.66)\nM(X0 ) =\nQ N (A\u03bb + B\u03bb )2\n\u03bb\nWe already know from Sect. 5.3.4, that a bound state of massless particles exists only if\n\u03bb > 0.

The linear potential\nThe case \u03bb = 1 corresponds to a linearly rising confining potential. It is of great interest\nin hadronic physics since a linearly rising potential appears to be the best way of modeling\nthe QCD confining interaction within potential approaches, see for example Ref. 94) for\nmore details. For the three-body problem, the one-body potential (term in a) corresponds\nto the so-called Y-junction, while the two-body potential (term in b) corresponds to the\nso-called \u2206 approximation. For physical problems, one has the choice of retaining one\napproximation or the other or both. Here for sake of generality we present the general case\nincluding both. In the real QCD world, one must take N = 3. But a general N value is\ninteresting to study alternative approaches of QCD.89), 90)\nFor \u03bb = 1, one can write\nr\np\nN\nc, with c = a + b CN .\nA1 + B1 =\n(6.69)\nQ\nThe solution of (6.63) when \u03bb = 1 is given by\nc\nX0 = \u221a F\u2212 (Y ),\n3\n\n(6.70)\n\nwhere F\u2212 (Y ) is given by (B.2) and where\nY=\n\n33/2 Nm2\n.\n2Qc\n\n(6.71)\n\nIntroducing this value in the expression of the energy (6.64), a simple calculation allows us\nto obtain the mass under the form\nr\n\u0014\n\u0015\n3\nF\u2212 (Y )\nM(X0 ) = Nm\nF\u2212 (Y ) +\n.\n(6.72)\n2Y\nF\u2212 (Y )\n\n\f81\nIn the ultrarelativistic limit, where m = 0, one obtains, from (6.66), the very simple\nrelation\nM(X0 )2 = 4Nc Q.\n(6.73)\nSuch a linear behavior of the square mass versus the principal quantum number is a wellknown fact in hadronic physics, where light mesons and baryons are known from experimental data to exhibit Regge trajectories.\nIn the nonrelativistic limit, the mass formula (6.68) can be recast under the form\n3\nM(X0 ) = mt +\n2\n\n\u0012\n\nNQ2 c2\nm\n\n\u00131/3\n\n.\n\n(6.74)\n\nThe second term is the \"binding energy\", which is a positive quantity in case of a positive\nlinear potential.\nIn the special case of a linear potential, there is a peculiar relationship between the mass\nof the two-body problem and the mass of the N-body problem. More precisely, let us call\nM (2) (\u03c3 , m, b, Q2 ) the AFM eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian\np\nH (2) = \u03c3 p 2 + m2 + br\n(6.75)\n\ncalculated with the natural quantum number Q2 = 2n + l + 3/2. Then, using (6.73) and its\ncounterpart for N = 2 with the value of the quantum number Q defined by (6.19), the mass\nM (N) (N, m, a, b, Q) of the original Hamiltonian is given by\n\u0011\n\u0010\np\n(6.76)\nM (N) (N, m, a, b, Q) = M (2) N, m, a + b CN , Q .\n\n6.4.3. Baryonic case\nIn this section, we want to discuss a special situation which can have an immediate\napplication for hadronic systems, especially baryons or glueballs.89), 90) Let us consider a\none-body potential with a linear shape and a two-body potential of Coulomb type (\u03bb = 1\nand \u03b7 = \u22121). We noticed that an analytical solution does exist, but one needs to solve a\ngeneral polynomial of degree 3 and the corresponding solution is quite involved. We prefer\nto give here the solution in the ultrarelativistic limit (m = 0). In this special case the solution\nof (6.60) is quite simple\na\n,\n(6.77)\nX0 =\nN\u22121 \u221a\n1 \u2212 b 2Q CN\nand (6.59) can be simplified as follows\nq\n\u221a\n3/2\nM(X0 ) = 2 a QN \u2212 bCN .\n\n(6.78)\n\nSince the argument of the square root must be positive, it is readily checked that, either\nthere exists a maximal allowed number of particles for a fixed value of b, either there exists\na maximal allowed value of b for a fixed number of particles. This kind of mass formula has\nbeen applied to the computation of light baryon masses for various theories of QCD with a\nlarge number of colors.89), 90)\n\n\f82\nIn order to test the relevance of our method, we apply it for a particular relativistic\nthree-body system: the light baryon composed of three massless quarks. In the framework\nof constituent models, the Hamiltonian for such a system is given by95), 96)\n3\n\nHB = \u2211\n\ni=1\n\nq\n\n3\n3\n2\n1\np 2i + \u03c3s \u2211 |rr i \u2212 R | \u2212 \u03b1S \u2211\n.\nr\n3\n|r\n\u2212\nr j|\ni=1\ni< j=1 i\n\n(6.79)\n\nThe dominant interaction is a confinement by three strings with density \u03c3s meeting at the\ncenter of mass. The short-range part is given by pairwise interactions of Coulomb nature\nwith a strong coupling constant \u03b1S . In order to allow a more realistic calculation of the\ncorrect baryon masses, this Hamiltonian must be completed with terms that can be computed\nin perturbation.95) Since these contributions represent no interest for the AFM, they are not\nconsidered in this study.\nLet us denote H\u0303 B the AFM counterpart of H B. Approximations of eigenmasses of\nthe genuine Hamiltonian are given by the application of (6.78) with N = 3, a = \u03c3s and\nb = 2\u03b1S /3,\ns\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\u03b1S\nAFB\nM0 = 12\u03c3s B + 3 \u2212 \u221a ,\n(6.80)\n3\nwhere B = 2(n1 + n2 ) + (l1 + l2 ) is the band number (see (6.19)). One can notice the strong\ndegeneracy due to the particular form of B. This formula generalizes a result obtained for\na small value of \u03b1S in Ref. 95). Following above considerations, these masses are upper\nbounds on the exact masses.\nIn order to test the accuracy of this formula, it is necessary to compute accurately eigenvalues of H B. It is possible, for instance, to use a variational method relying on the expansion\nof trial states with a harmonic oscillator basis.97) We can write\n|\u03c8 i =\n\nBmax\n\n\u2211 \u2211 |\u03c6 (B, q(B))i,\n\n(6.81)\n\nB=0 q(B)\n\nwhere B characterizes the band number of the basis state and where q summarizes all the\nquantum numbers of the state (which can depend on B). This procedure is specially interesting since the eigenstates of H B are expanded in terms of eigenstates of H\u0303 B (up to a length\nscale factor). In practice, a relative accuracy better than 10\u22124 is reached with Bmax = 20.\nSuch results are denoted \"exact\" in the following.\nBefore comparing exact masses with formula (6.80), it is significant to describe the\nbaryon wavefunctions. Quarks are fermions of spin 1/2 with isospin and color degrees of\nfreedom. The global color function is unique and completely antisymmetrical. For total spin\nS = 3/2 (isospin T = 3/2) the spin (isospin) wavefunction is completely symmetrical. The\ncorresponding wave function are of mixed symmetry for S = 1/2 or T = 1/2. Using degenerate eigenstates of H\u0303 B, it is always possible to build three-quark states completely antisymmetrical,91), 97) which are characterized by the same mass. For instance, when S = T = 3/2\nor S = T = 1/2, the baryon states possess a spatial wavefunction completely symmetrical. In\nthe real world, the degeneracies are removed by spin- or isospin-dependent operators which\ncan be computed as perturbations.95) When an eigenstate of H B is computed for given values\nof S, T , and the total angular momentum L, we determine the band number of its dominant\n\n\f83\ncomponents. It can then be compared with the eigenstate of H\u0303 B with the same spin-isospin\nquantum numbers and the same band number.\nIn Table XIV, exact masses are compared with the predictions of formula (6.80) for\nusual values of the parameters \u03c3s and \u03b1S . The relative error can be large but the quality of\nthe approximation is quite reasonable for a so simple formula. Due to the strong degeneracy\nof the harmonic oscillator, all AFM eigenstates with the same band number have the same\nenergy. This approximation is better for high values of L. Let us note that the relative error\ncan be reduced by a factor around 2 when \u03b1S \u2192 0. When \u03b1S = 0, the relative error becomes\n\u221a\nindependent of the energy scale factor \u03c3s .\nTable XIV.

The number in brackets is the probability (%) of the\ncomponent with the band number B in the harmonic oscillator expansion (6.81). These results are compared\nwith the masses given by formulae (6.80), (6.82), and (6.83). The number in parenthesis is the relative error\n(%) with respect to the exact value.

By fitting another form on\nexact eigenvalues, a very high accuracy can sometimes be reached. Here, we will proceed\ndifferently and will try to use analytical results to find the best shape for the mass formula.\nUsing a good upper bound on the ground state given by the trial state of (6.81) at Bmax = 0,\na modified AFM formula was proposed\nr\n\u0011\n\u221a\n32 \u0010\nM1AFB =\n(6.82)\n\u03c3s B + 3 \u2212 3\u03b1S .\n\u03c0\nOne can see in Table XIV that the masses are greatly improved, but the variational character\nof the formula (6.82) cannot longer be guaranteed: some masses are now below the exact\n\n\f84\nones. At last, using information coming from the WKB method,56) the problem of the strong\ndegeneracy has been improved by a new formula\nr\n\u0011\n\u221a\n32 \u0010 \u2032\n\u03c0\nwith B\u2032 = (n1 + n2 ) + (l1 + l2 ).\nM2AFB =\n\u03c3s B + 3 \u2212 3\u03b1S\n(6.83)\n\u03c0\n2\nDetails about these procedures are given in Ref. 68). One can see in Table XIV, that the\nrelative error is now around 1% and generally below. Despite its simplicity and its nonvariational character, (6.83) is then a very good mass formula for the eigenstates of the\nHamiltonian (6.79). It is not sure that the procedure used here to improve the mass formula\nfor baryons could work so well for other Hamiltonians. But, this shows that an improvement\nis possible, at least in some particular cases.\n6.4.4. Atomic systems\nWe turn now our attention to atom-like systems, i.e. systems described by the following\nHamiltonian\nN\nN\nN q\n1\n1\nHat = \u2211 p 2i + m2 \u2212 \u03b1 \u2211 + \u1fb1 \u2211\n.\n(6.84)\nr\nr\ni\ni\nj\ni=1\ni< j=1\ni=1\nFor this section, we remain completely general, the only hypothesis being that the parameters \u03b1 and \u1fb1 should be real positive numbers. The obvious application could correspond in a\nfirst approximation to N identical electrons, with charge e, feeling the attraction of a central\nstatic source (the nucleus) and their own repulsion. In this particular situation, one must\nmake the identification \u03b1 = Ne2 and \u1fb1 = e2 . At this stage, we point out that our formalism\nis spin-independent and thus that this model cannot be directly applied to a real physical\natom. Moreover, one should be very careful in applying the formulae already given. Two\ncautions are in order:\n\u2022 In (6.84), ri must be the distance between the particle i and the center of mass of the\nsystem of N electrons. In the atomic interpretation, this center of mass must coincide\nwith the nucleus. This is not always the case but this prescription should be valid in\ncase of a spherical atom.\n\u2022 Electrons are fermions and the total wavefunction (space and spin) must be completely\nantisymmetrical. Since the spatial wavefunction cannot be completely symmetrical, all\npossible values are not allowed for Q given by (J.17). For closed shell atoms, QAGS\n(J.19) should be used to estimate the ground-state energy only.\nNevertheless, solving Hamiltonian (6.84) has an intrinsic interest since, to our knowledge, no corresponding analytical mass formula is known so far. A general solution can\nmoreover be found with the relativistic kinematics, starting from (6.63) and (6.64). Applying them to the case \u03bb = \u22121, a = \u03b1 , b = \u2212\u1fb1 and defining\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u1fb1 3/2\n1\n\u03b1 N \u2212 CN ,\n(6.85)\nD=\nQ\nN\nthe solution of equation (6.63) is given by\nX0 =\n\nNm2 D2\n.\nQ(1 \u2212 D2 )\n\n(6.86)\n\n\f85\nThe mass formula (6.64) then reads\nM(X0 ) = mt\n\np\n\n1 \u2212 D2 .\n\n(6.87)\n\nIn the ultrarelativistic limit, this expression gives the value M = 0. This property is well\nknown in the two-particle system and prolongates to the N-body problem. It is quite obvious\nthat a system of massless particles cannot be characterized by a (negative) binding energy\nsince the resulting mass would be negative. Moreover, with a Coulomb-type potential, the\nonly energy scale of the problem is the particle mass. So, if this mass vanishes, no bound\nstate can exist. In the nonrelativistic regime, one must assume that the D quantity is small\nin (6.87). In this case\n1\nM nr = mt \u2212 mt D2 .\n(6.88)\n2\nIt is clear from formula (6.87) that the value of the parameters cannot be arbitrary. One\nmust satisfy the condition D < 1. Explicitly this means\n3/2\n\n\u03b1 N 2 \u2212 \u1fb1CN < QN.\n\n(6.89)\n\nLet us emphasize that this condition is independent of the mass of the particle.98) Let us\nnotice that, for \u03b1 = Ne2 and \u1fb1 = e2 , a maximal value of N exists if Q increases less rapidly\nthat N 2 .\n6.5. Duality relations\n6.5.1. Generalities\nIn this section, we will show that AFM is a very powerful method to give relationships\nbetween the energies of states (excited or ground states) for two different systems. We call\nthe relations between the energies of both systems \"duality relations\". The case for which\none of the two systems contains 2 particles is specially interesting since the corresponding\neigenenergies are rather easy to obtain. These relations are exact if we consider the energies\nobtained in the AFM; they are no longer exact for the true eigenstates, but if AFM gives a\ngood precision on the true states, we hope that the duality relations are good approximations\nof the physical situations and gives, at least, general trends for the exact levels. A rather\ncomplete treatment of duality relations can be found in Ref. 99). We present here a simplified\nversion where we restrict our discussion to systems of N identical particles interacting only\nthrough a two-body potential V (r). Readers interested in more specific details may have a\nglance to Ref. 99) for further informations.\nOur original Hamiltonian is thus\nN q\nN\nH = \u2211 p 2i + m2 + \u2211 V (|rr i \u2212 r j |).\n(6.90)\ni=1\n\ni< j=1\n\nIn this expression r i is the position operator for particle i, p i its conjugate momentum and m\nthe common mass of all particles. The AFM mass of the system is given by (6.26) which is\nwritten now as\ns\n!\nr\n2Q\nQ\n2\nM(X0 ) = N m + X0 +CNV\n,\n(6.91)\nN\n(N \u2212 1)X0\n\n\f86\nwhile the X0 quantity is solution of the transcendental equation (6.27) which turns out to be\nnow\ns\n!\nr\n2Q\nQ\nX02 = 2N m2 + X0 L\n,\n(6.92)\nN\n(N \u2212 1)X0\nand where L(x) = V \u2032 (x)/(2x) as usual (see (6.5)).\nIn general, the potential V (r) depends on physical parameters {\u03c41 , \u03c42 , . . . , \u03c4 p } \u2261 {\u03c4 }\nand should be noted more precisely V ({\u03c4 }; r). The other parameters of the problem are the\nnumber of particles N and the mass m of the particles. Lastly, we want to have a description\nof the whole spectrum, so that the principal quantum number Q also enters the game. In\nconsequence, a complete notation for the eigenmasses would be M (N) ({\u03c4 }; m, Q).\nLet us stress now a very important point: for realistic potentials, the parameters {\u03c4 }\ncould depend on N or/and m. We do not consider such a particular behavior here. Thus we\nassume that the parameters of the potentials are independent of N and m. This means\nthat the m dependence of H is only through the kinetic energy and its N dependence through\nthe numbers of terms in the summation. We suppose that the potentials are given once for all\nand consider that their form and parameters do not vary for all studied systems. Therefore\nwe are finally interested only by the N, m, Q dependence of the eigenmasses and use the\nsimplified notation M (N) (m, Q). What we call a \"duality relation\" is just a relation between\nM (N) (m, Q) and M (p) (m\u2032 , Q\u2032 ).\n6.5.2. General case\nInstead of the X0 quantity, let us define the new variable\ns0 =\n\ns\n\n2Q\n.\n(N \u2212 1)X0\n\n(6.93)\n\nThen, the transcendental equation (6.92) and the mass expression (6.91) are replaced by the\nfollowing ones\n2Q\n\u221a = s20\n(N \u2212 1) CN\n\nq\n\nM (N) (m, Q) = CN\n\n\u0014\n\n1 +CN (m s0 /Q)2 V \u2032 (s0 ),\n2Q\n1\n\u221a\n(N \u2212 1) CN s0\n\nq\n\n\u0015\n1 +CN (m s0 /Q)2 +V (s0 ) .\n\n(6.94)\n(6.95)\n\nA little algebra on those equations allows to arrive at the following duality relation\nbetween the N-body and the p-body systems with particles interacting via the same twobody interaction\n!\nr\np \u2212 1 Cp\nCN (p) p \u2212 1\n(N)\nm,\nM\nQ .\n(6.96)\nM (m, Q) =\nCp\nN \u2212 1 N \u2212 1 CN\nIn this case, the spectrum of the N-body system is the same as the p-body system (with the\nsame two-body potential) provided we consider different particle masses in both situations\nand different excitation states.\n\n\f87\n6.5.3. Ultrarelativistic limit\nThe case of ultrarelativistic systems, characterized by a vanishing mass m = 0, presents\nsome very specific and interesting features. The case of systems composed of gluons or/and\nlight quarks can be well represented in this scheme. The Hamiltonian of the system is then\nN q\nN\n(6.97)\nH = \u2211 p 2i + \u2211 V (|rr i \u2212 r j |).\ni=1\n\ni< j=1\n\nIndeed, the formulation is simpler for this particular situation. Putting the value m = 0 in\n(6.91) and (6.92), one gets a new set of equations. The transcendental equation looks like\ns\n!\nr\nN 3/2\n2Q\nX = 2NL\n,\n(6.98)\nQ 0\n(N \u2212 1)X0\nwhile the corresponding AFM eigenmass is given by\ns\np\nMu (X0 ) = NQX0 +CNV\n\n2Q\n(N \u2212 1)X0\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(6.99)\n\n(N)\n\nThe eigenmass, depending now only on N and Q, will be noted Mu (Q) (the index u stands\nfor \"ultrarelativistic\").\nWith the same definition (6.93) for s0 , the transcendental equation (6.98) reduces to\n2Q\n\u221a = s20V \u2032 (s0 ).\n(N \u2212 1) CN\n\n(6.100)\n\nDefining the D(x) and F(x) function as in (5.27) and (5.28) calculated with the potential\nV (x), one has\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2Q\n\u221a\n,\n(6.101)\ns0 = D\n(N \u2212 1) CN\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2Q\n(N)\n\u221a\n.\n(6.102)\nMu (Q) = CN F\n(N \u2212 1) CN\n\nAs we already mentioned, the D and F functions are universal. From expression (6.102),\none deduces immediately the duality relation\n!\nr\nCN (p) p \u2212 1 C p\n(N)\nMu (Q) =\nMu\nQ ,\n(6.103)\nCp\nN \u2212 1 CN\nwhich is the special case of (6.96) with m = 0.\n6.5.4. Nonrelativistic limit\nAnother interesting limit of the theory is the nonrelativistic one, valid when the mass of\nthe particles is large compared to the mean potential. In this case, the considered Hamiltonian is simply\nN\nN\np2\n(6.104)\nH = \u2211 i + \u2211 V (|rr i \u2212 r j |).\ni=1 2m\ni< j=1\n\n\f88\nInstead of dealing with the total mass M (N) , it is better to consider the binding energy\nobtained by removing the total rest mass: E (N) = M (N) \u2212 Nm. The AFM approximation\nE (N) (m, Q) of the binding energy is given by the following equations,\ns\n!\n2Q\nX02 = 2mNL\n(6.105)\n(N \u2212 1)X0\nand\nQX0\n+CNV\nE (N) (X0 ) =\n2m\n\ns\n\n2Q\n(N \u2212 1)X0\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(6.106)\n\nWe will see that, in this nonrelativistic limit, one obtains additional interesting properties.\nIntroducing s0 by (6.93) as above, the transcendental equation (6.105) reduces to\nNQ2\n= s30V \u2032 (s0 ).\nmCN2\n\n(6.107)\n\nDefining the D(x) and F (x) function as in (4.11) and (4.13) calculated with the potential\nV (x), one has\n\u0013\n\u0012\nNQ2\n,\n(6.108)\ns0 = D\nmCN2\n\u0012\n\u0013\nNQ2\n(N)\nE (m, Q) = CN F\n.\n(6.109)\nmCN2\nAs the case studied in the previous section, the D and F functions are universal. For a\nnonrelativistic system, an additional property appears. Remarking that E (N) depends only\non the ratio Q2 /m, one has the general duality relation\nE (N) (m, Q) = E (N) (\u03b2 2 m, \u03b2 Q),\nvalid for any value of the real parameter \u03b2 .\nFrom expression (6.109), one deduces immediately the duality relation\n!\nr\nC\nC\np\n\u2212\n1\np\n\u2212\n1\np\nN (p)\nE (N) (m, Q) =\nE\nm,\nQ ,\nCp\nN \u2212 1 N \u2212 1 CN\n\n(6.110)\n\n(6.111)\n\nwhich is identical to the general case (6.96). One can use thepproperty (6.110) to obtain\nmany other possibilities. For example, choosing the value \u03b2 = p(N \u2212 1)/(N(p \u2212 1)), one\nhas the alternative simpler duality relation\n\u0013\n\u0012\nCN (p) p C p\n(N)\nE\nm, Q .\n(6.112)\nE (m, Q) =\nCp\nN CN\np\nIn this last relation, let us choose \u03b2 = N/p, one arrives at the relation\nr\n\u0013\n\u0012\nCN (p)\np\u22121 p\n(N)\nE (m, Q) =\nQ .\n(6.113)\nE\nm,\nCp\nN\u22121 N\n\n\f89\nIn this expression, we decide to keep the same mass for systems with N and p particles. The\nduality relation leads to a link between different excited states of both systems. Choosing\nthe value \u03b2 = CN /C p in equation (6.112), one obtains the alternative expression\nE\n\n(N)\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nCN (p) (N \u2212 1)CN\n(m, Q) =\nE\nm, Q .\nCp\n(p \u2212 1)C p\n\n(6.114)\n\nIn this expression we decide to maintain a one to one correspondence in the spectrum but\nfor systems with different particle masses.\n6.5.5. Passing from nonrelativistic to ultrarelativistic limits\nWe showed that both the ultrarelativistic limit and the nonrelativistic limit for the eigenmasses share the property of being expressed in terms of universal functions. The F function\nfor the ultrarelativistic case and the F function for the nonrelativistic case are independent\nof the system and of the excitation quantum numbers, but depends only on the form of the\npotential under consideration.\nIf the same form of potential is used in both situations, the expressions of the F function\nand of the F function are not identical so that the corresponding spectra are quite different.\nHowever, we showed in Ref. 99) that if the potentials are different but linked by a certain\nrelationship, one can arrive at very interesting conclusions.\nWe report here the main conclusions, skipping all the rigorous proofs that can be found\nin the previous reference. Let us consider a system described by a nonrelativistic treatment\nbased on a two-body potential V (r) whose binding energy is E (N) (m, Q). One knows that\nE (N) (m, Q) = CN F (R)\n\nwith\n\nR=\n\nNQ2\n.\nmCN2\n\n(6.115)\n\nR\n.\n2\u03b1 2\n\n(6.116)\n\n\u221a\nIf one uses rather the potential W (r) = V (\u03b1 r) , one has\nE (N) (m, Q) = CN F(S)\n\nwith S =\n\n\u221a\nIf we take the special value S = 2Q/((N \u2212 1) CN ), the value CN F(S) represents the\n(N)\nultrarelativistic mass Mu (Q) of the same system but obtained with the potential W (r). The\ncondition on S and the link between S and R leads to the condition defining the value of \u03b1 ,\nnamely\np\nQ = 2m CN \u03b1 2 .\n(6.117)\nIn consequence, one can state the following theorem:\nIf E (N) (m, Q) is the binding energy of a nonrelativistic system governed by the\n(N)\ntwo-body potential V (r) and if Mu (Q) is the mass of the related ultrarelativistic\nby the two-body potential W (r) defined by W (r) =\n\u0011\n\u0010p system\u221agoverned\n(N)\nQr/(2m CN ) , then one has the general property Mu (Q) = E (N) (m, Q).\nV\n(N)\n\nFrom its definition, the potential W (r) depends on m so that the notation Mu (Q) which we\nhave used up to now, depends indirectly on m, as imposed by the theorem.\n\n\f90\n6.5.6. Applying duality relations to exact levels\nAll the duality relations presented above are exact for the AFM solutions of quantum\nsystems. One can wonder to what extent these constraints are satisfied for the corresponding\nexact solutions. We discuss briefly this point and, again, refer the reader to Ref. 99) for\nadditional information. We are interested essentially to the case of nonrelativistic systems.\nLet us call \u03b5 (N) (m; {ni , li }) the exact eigenenergy for state of the Hamiltonian (6.90)\nwith {ni , li } = {n1 , l1 , n2 , l2 , . . . , nN\u22121 , lN\u22121 }, while \u03b5 (m; n, l) = \u03b5 (2) (m; {n, l}) gives the exact spectrum of the corresponding two-body problem. The first thing to do is to connect\nthe exact level \u03b5 (N) (m; {ni , li }) to the corresponding AFM approximation E (N) (m, Q). Of\ncourse, one can always impose an equality between both\n\n\u03b5 (N) (m; {ni , li }) = E (N) (m, Q(m; {ni , li })).\n\n(6.118)\n\nThis equality defines in practice the value of the principal quantum number Q that must be\nused in the AFM solution. The problem is that the value obtained in that way does depend\nexplicitly on the mass m, in addition to the basic quantum numbers {ni , li }. This is contrary\nto the philosophy of the AFM approach for which Q depends on {ni , li } only. To apply\nAFM formulas, one must give up the dependence on m for Q and choose a dependence on\nquantum numbers only, Q({ni , li }). With such a constraint, the equality (6.118) does not\nhold anymore and is replaced by an approximate value\n\n\u03b5 (N) (m; {ni , li }) \u2248 E (N) (m, Q(N) ({ni , li })).\n\n(6.119)\n\nThe cleverness of the physicist is to guess the form for Q(N) ({ni , li }) which makes the previous approximation as precise as possible. The choice (6.19) is the most natural one since\nit follows directly from the construction of the AFM levels. However, the corresponding\napproximation is not always good and, moreover, it is plagued by degeneracies which are\nabsent in the real physical spectrum. A choice like the one proposed above (6.39) could be\nmuch better in this respect, but very often the determination of the parameters entering it\nneeds a preliminary study of the problem. Let us suppose that we have the technical ability\nto choose a practical and correct form for the principal quantum number.\nThe idea of the method is to approximate the exact values by the AFM ones and to take\nthe exact duality relations on the AFM results to extend them to the true states. This can be\ndone in two steps\n1. the link between the excited state of the N-body problem to the ground state of another\nN-body problem;\n2. the link between the ground state of the N-body problem to the ground state of a twobody problem which can be solved easily.\nThese two steps are the consequence of the duality relations given above and their proofs\ncan be found in Ref. 99). Here we focus essentially on the practical result.\nThe two-body problem can be solved exactly (at least numerically) for two particles of\nmass m interacting through the potential V (r). Thus, given the potential V , the ground sate\nenergy is function of the mass only. Let us define the f function by\nf (m) = \u03b5 (m; 0, 0).\n\n(6.120)\n\nThis function is universal in the sense that it depends only on the form of the potential V (r)\n\n\f91\nand it can be computed once for all. An example of the function f (m) for the Hamiltonian\nH = p2 /m + r is given in Fig. 5.\n\nFig. 5. Universal function f (m) as a function of the mass m for the ground state of the two-body problem with\nV (r) = r.\n\nThe conclusion of the two steps indicated previously can be summarized by the following approximation\n(6.121)\n\u03b5 (N) (m; {ni , li }) \u2248 CN f (M(m; {ni , li })\nwith the following expression for the mass M entering as the argument in the f function:\n!2\n2m CN Q(2) (0, 0)\nM(m; {ni , li }) =\n.\n(6.122)\nN Q(N) ({ni , li })\nThe conclusion of the relation (6.121) is very strong. It proves that the whole spectrum\nof all systems can be obtained approximatively by the calculation of a universal function,\nf (m), corresponding to the ground state of the 2-body system with the same potential, and\nfor arguments M(m; {ni , li }) given by (6.122). Getting f (m) is a very easy task. Solving the\n2-body system can be performed with a great accuracy for any potential (let us recall that\nthis potential must not depend on m and N); moreover, obtaining the ground state energy\nis free from possible numerical complications arising for excited states. Let us note also\nthat the duality relation (6.121), which is obviously an approximation, concerns the exact\neigenvalues only; the AFM values, which were very convenient intermediate quantities in\nour demonstration, have completely disappeared. The accuracy of this duality relation for\nexact states has been tested with success in Ref. 99) for some systems.\n\u00a77. Conclusions\n\nIn this paper, we presented a detailed review of the auxiliary field method (AFM) to\nsolve eigenequations in the context of quantum mechanics. We showed that this method\nis very powerful to obtain closed analytical approximate expressions for the properties of\nmany physically interesting systems.\n\n\f92\nThe idea of the method is to replace a Hamiltonian H for which analytical solutions\nare not known by another one H\u0303 for which they are known. For instance, a potential V (r)\nnot solvable is replaced by another one P(r) more familiar, or a semirelativistic kinetic part\nis replaced by an equivalent nonrelativistic one. The bridge between both Hamiltonians is\nensured by a special function including one or more auxiliary fields. These fields can be\ndetermined by an extremization procedure and Hamiltonian H\u0303 reduces to Hamiltonian H.\nIn so doing the original problem is completely equivalent to the new one. The approximation\ncomes from the replacement of the auxiliary fields by pure real constants. The approximant\nsolutions for H are then obtained by the solutions of H\u0303 in which the auxiliary parameters\nare eliminated by an extremization procedure for the eigenenergies.\nThe great advantage of this method is that it is able to predict the behavior of the observables in terms of the various parameters entering into the problem and also in terms of the\nquantum numbers. We presented the principles of the method, its characteristics, its major\nproperties and we discussed the quality of the results for many relevant situations appearing\nin various domains of physics. The only restriction is the fact that, for relativistic systems or\nmany-body problems, the computation is manageable only for systems composed of identical particles.\nAlthough we focused essentially on the search for closed formulae of the eigenenergies,\nwe showed that the method is also able to provide good results for the eigenstates and for\ndifferent types of observables. In this context the harmonic oscillator wavefunctions and the\nhydrogen-like wavefunctions are particularly important. As an example, we proved that the\nAFM is very simple to implement for the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with a linear potential and\ngives very satisfactory results.\nThe main part of the paper deals with the approximate values coming from the AFM\nconcerning the binding energies of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation (nonrelativistic) and the eigenmasses of the spinless Salpeter equation (semirelativistic). We proved a number of very\nimportant and pleasant general features of the method:\n\u2022 The AFM is essentially a kind of mean field approximation. In particular, using a\npower-law form for P(r), one can define a \"mean radius\" r0 and a \"mean momentum\"\np0 which allows to express the final AFM eigenvalue in the very simple form T (p0 ) +\nV (r0 ), where T (|pp|) and V (|rr |) are respectively the kinetic and potential part of H.\nA very simple link exists between p0 and r0 . This last parameter is the solution of a\ntranscendental equation which looks like a semiclassical version of a generalized virial\ntheorem.\n\u2022 Even in complicated situations (for example N-body systems with relativistic kinematics, and presence of both one and two-body interactions), the AFM can always be\nbrought to the resolution of a transcendental equation, a procedure quite easy from the\nnumerical point of view. In many cases, this transcendental equation can be solved\nanalytically and the corresponding results have been presented in this paper.\n\u2022 We discovered, and demonstrated, an amazing property of the AFM solutions that we\ncalled \"universality of the form\". This means that, provided a power-law potential is\nchosen for the function P(r), the AFM gives an universal expression of the resulting\nenergies for any potential V (r) under consideration, whatever the exponent chosen for\npower-law potential. The only remnant of this exponent is entirely contained in the\nform of a principal quantum number Q(n, l). This property of universality is valid not\n\n\f93\nonly for the eigenvalues but also for the parameter r0 and is maintained passing from\na nonrelativistic treatment to a semirelativistic one.\n\u2022 The AFM is fully equivalent to the envelope theory (ET) and, as such, it can benefit\nof all the properties already demonstrated in the framework of this method which was\nintroduced a long time ago. In particular, in many occasions, one can deduce that the\nAFM energies are upper or lower bounds on the exact energy depending on the convexity of a certain function linked to the potential. As in the ET, the energy function\n(potential and/or kinetics) appearing in H\u0303 is, in a sense, the best possible energy function tangent to the exact one. But, in the AFM, we also pushed the theory in tracks that\nhave not been explored by ET.\n\u2022 If we consider only the AFM approximation for the energy, we were able to prove\nseveral exact duality relations between different types of problems. For instance, a\nnonrelativistic problem with a potential V (r) can be \u221a\nreduced to the ultrarelativistic\n(m = 0) problem with a related potential W (r) = V (\u03b1 r), and the mass of a N-body\nsystem with identical particles is related to the mass of a two-body system with a\nsimple renormalization of the parameters. Moreover, these duality relations are shown\napproximately verified for exact solutions.\nThe 2-body Schr\u00f6dinger equation with a power-law potential was the prototype for the\nstarting potential P(r). The resulting AFM energies are particularly simple. Using the \"universality of the form\" we proposed expressions for the principal quantum numbers Q(n, l)\nwhich allow to improve drastically the quality of the results. In some cases, a sophisticated\nexpression for Q gives a relative accuracy of the order of 10\u22124 over tens of the lowest sates\nof the spectrum, while even a very simple prescription is already able to give an accuracy of\nthe order of 10\u22122 . Since the AFM can be used recursively, the power-law potential is very\noften chosen as the basic potential P(r).\nIn the framework of a nonrelativistic approach, we applied the AFM to a great number\nof 2-body problems with potentials of various forms: sum of powers, square root, exponential potentials. In each case the AFM reproduces in a very simple way the basic properties of\nthe solutions, even when the starting interaction P(r) is very far from the genuine potential\nV (r). We were able to give a closed form for the energies of two particles interacting via a\nfunnel potential. This situation is quite realistic in hadronic systems and, to our knowledge,\nit is the first time that an analytical expression for the corresponding eigenenergies is given.\nThe AFM gives a very general formula for the critical coupling constants of nonrelativistic Hamiltonians with a finite number of bound states. The dependence on the quantum\nnumbers, the mass m of the particles, the number N of particles, and the structure of the\npotential are predicted. Different N behaviours are obtained depending on the one-body or\npairwise character of the interaction. If the AFM gives upper (lower) bounds for the exact\neigenvalues, the critical coupling constants predicted are upper (lower) bounds for the exact\ncritical coupling constants.\nThe 2-body Salpeter equation is also tested for a variety of potentials: power laws,\nsquare root, funnel. We showed that, at the limit of a large mass, the nonrelativistic expression is recovered in each case. The ultrarelativistic limit leads to particularly simple\nexpressions. The expression for the funnel potential is really astonishing of simplicity in the\ncase of massless particles.\nOnce a problem is solved within the AFM (quantities p0 and r0 found), it is very easy\n\n\f94\nto compute the contribution of a small perturbation at the first order. It is given by the\nperturbation Hamiltonian evaluated at the mean momentum p0 for a kinetic energy or at a\nfunction of the mean radius r0 for a potential. The result does not coincide with the one\nobtained by the quantum perturbation theory, but the agreement can be very good.\nLastly the AFM is able to provide analytical results for the N-body problems even for\nquite sophisticated types of potential: Coulomb, linear, funnel interactions are presented.\nAlthough the accuracy would probably become worse and worse with increasing values of\nN, we showed that the spectrum of a realistic 3-body system can be reproduced with a 1%\naccuracy if a good definition of the principal quantum number Q is adopted. Let us mention\nalso that the AFM N-body results were recently applied to the computation of light baryon\nmasses for various theories of QCD with a large number of colors.89), 90)\nIn summary, the auxiliary field method is easy to use, can be applied to a great varieties\nof problems in quantum mechanics regardless the number of particles, exhibits remarkable\nproperties and is able to provide closed analytical expressions of sometimes very impressive\naccuracy.\nAppendix A\nThe envelope theory\nA.1. Presentation of the envelope theory\nAs the AFM, the envelope theory (ET)45) is a method aiming to get approximate analytical energy formulae from an arbitrary Hamiltonian. Initially, it has been introduced to\nobtain bounds on the eigenenergies of the N-body problem (see Ref. 86)). Later, it has been\nexplored and refined to simpler systems and to other purposes. We only present here its key\nfeatures and refer the reader to Refs. 45), 100), 101), 102) for a detailed discussion about the\nbasis and applications of ET.\nLet us set V (r) = v f (r) in Hamiltonian (2.1). Then the energy spectrum of this Hamiltonian is formally given by E = F(v), where the dependence on the usual quantum numbers\nn and l will be dropped for simplicity. The function F(v) is concave but not necessarily\nmonotonic. This allows to define a so-called kinetic potential k(S) by using the Legendre\ntransformation (here the prime denotes the derivative with respect to v)\nk(S) = F \u2032 (v)\n\nand\n\nS = F(v) \u2212 v F \u2032 (v).\n\n(A.1)\n\nThis transformation can be understood as follows. |\u03a8 i being the eigenstates of Hamiltonian (2.1), one can define S = h\u03a8 | T (pp2 ) |\u03a8 i and rewrite formally the energy spectrum as\nF(v) = S + v h\u03a8 | f (r) |\u03a8 i \u2261 S + v k(S). The transformation (A.1) follows from these relations. One is consequently led to the exact formula\nE = F(v) = min [S + v k(S)] .\nS>0\n\n(A.2)\n\nWhat can now be done to go a step further in ET is to assume that V (r) = g(P(r)),\nwhere P(r) is a potential for which the solution of the eigenequation\n\u0002\n\u0003\nT (pp2 ) + v P(r) |\u03a8A i = \u03b5A (v) |\u03a8A i\n(A.3)\nis analytically known. Then,\n\ns = h\u03a8A | T (pp2 ) |\u03a8A i\n\n(A.4)\n\n\f95\ncan be analytically computed. It can moreover be shown that the kinetic potential corresponding to V (r), namely K(s), is given approximately by\n(A.5)\n\nK(s) \u2248 g(kA (s)),\n\nwhere kA (s) is the kinetic potential associated to P(r). One then obtains an approximate\nform for the eigenenergies that reads45)\n(A.6)\n\nE \u2248 E = min [s + g(kA (s))] .\ns>0\n\nThe variable s actually plays the role of a variational parameter. But, thanks to (A.3), the\nfollowing equalities hold\n\n\u03b5A (v) = s + v kA (s),\n\n\u03b5A\u2032 (v) = kA (s),\n\n(A.7)\n\nand another approximate energy formula coming from the rewriting of (A.6) is\n\u0002\n\u0003\nE = min \u03b5A (v) \u2212 v \u03b5A\u2032 (v) + g(\u03b5A\u2032 (v)) .\n\n(A.8)\n\nv\n\nThis last formula is called the principal envelope formula in Refs. 101), 102).\nIt is possible to understand (A.8) as follows. If V (r) = g(P(r)), with g(x) a smooth\nfunction of x, then we can define the \"tangential potential\" V t (r) at the point r = t as\nV t (r) = a(t) P(r) + g(P(t)) \u2212 a(t) P(t)\nV \u2032 (t)\nwith a(t) = \u2032\n= g\u2032 (P(t)).\nP (t)\n\n(A.9)\n\nSuch a particular form is obtained by demanding that V t (r) and its derivative agree with\nV (r) and V \u2032 (r) at the point of contact r = t. If \u03b5 \u226a 1, one has indeed\nV (t + \u03b5 ) \u2212V t (t + \u03b5 ) =\n\n\u03b5 2 \u2032 2 \u2032\u2032\nP (t) g (P(t)) + O(\u03b5 3 ).\n2\n\n(A.10)\n\nThe eigenenergies of Hamiltonian H t = T (pp2 ) +V t (r), denoted by E (t), are given by\nE (t) = \u03b5A (a(t)) + g(P(t)) \u2212 a(t) P(t).\n\n(A.11)\n\nLet us now set\nt = a\u22121 (v).\n\n(A.12)\nIt can be computed from (A.9) that a\u22121 (v) = P\u22121 (A(v)) with A(v) = g\u2032\u22121 (v), and (A.11)\nbecomes\nE (v) = \u03b5A (v) + g(A(v)) \u2212 v A(v).\n(A.13)\nThe final energy spectrum has to be extremized with respect to v, so we have\n\n\u2202v E (v)|v=v0 = 0 \u21d2 A(v0 ) = \u03b5A\u2032 (v0 )\n\n(A.14)\n\nand the physical energy reads\nE (v0 ) = \u03b5A (v0 ) + g(\u03b5A\u2032 (v0 )) \u2212 v0 \u03b5A\u2032 (v0 ),\n\n(A.15)\n\n\f96\nthat is nothing else than the principal envelope formula (A.8).\nWe have just shown that ET can lead to analytical approximate energy formulae, namely\n(A.6) and (A.8), which are both equivalent. Moreover, it has been shown in Ref. 45), as\nsuggested by (A.10), that E is a lower (upper) bound on the exact energy if the function g\nis convex (concave), that is if g\u2032\u2032 > 0 (g\u2032\u2032 < 0). Let us note that H and H t have the same\nkinetic part. The tangential potential indeed always underestimates (overestimates) the exact\npotential in this case. A clear interest of ET is thus that it allows to know the variational or\nantivariational nature of the approximation that is performed. In practice, this information\ncan be obtained only for a nonrelativistic kinematics, since it is necessary to know exactly\n\u03b5A (v) in (A.3).\nA.2. Equivalence between AFM and ET\nThe similarity of the starting points of ET and the AFM is obvious: In both cases, a\npotential for which no analytical solution is known is \"approximated\" by an other potential\nfor which analytical solutions exist. It suggests that a connection between both approaches\nshould exist; and it will indeed be established in this section. Let us apply the AFM as\ndescribed above with V (r) = g(P(r)). We find the following expression for the energy (2.11)\nE(\u03bd ) = \u03b5A (\u03bd ) + g (P(J(\u03bd ))) \u2212 \u03bd P(J(\u03bd )),\n\n(A.16)\n\nthe function J(x) = K \u22121 (x) being computed from the relation (2.3). Remarkably, this AFM\nformula is equal to the ET one (A.13) since J(x) = P\u22121 (g\u2032\u22121 (x)). Consequently, the AFM\nand the ET lead to the same final energy formula (A.6). The link between both approaches\nis given by\n\u03bd = a(t).\n(A.17)\nMoreover, with the point r0 defined by the relation r0 = J(\u03bd0 ), the potential \u1e7c (r) takes the\nform\n\u1e7c (r) = K(r0 ) (P(r) \u2212 P(r0 )) +V (r0 ).\n(A.18)\nIt is then easy to see that \u1e7c (r0 ) = V (r0 ) and that \u1e7c \u2032 (r0 ) = V \u2032 (r0 ). So, the potential \u1e7c (r) is\ntangent to the potential V (r). An explicit example is presented in Ref. 46).\nThe function J(x) can be defined if the function K(x) can be inverted. In order to\nfulfill this condition, it is sufficient that K(x) is monotonic, that is to say that K \u2032 (x) has a\nconstant sign. But, from the definitions above, we have K(x) = g\u2032 (P(x)), which implies that\nK \u2032 (x) = g\u2032\u2032 (P(x)) P\u2032 (x). Since K(x) must be monotonic, the convexity of the function g is\nwell defined if P(x) is also monotonic. This is the case if P(x) is a power-law potential, for\ninstance. In these conditions, the convexity of the function g can also be used to determine\nthe variational character of the AFM.\nLet us summarize our results. The auxiliary field \u03bd can be introduced as an operator\nin the Hamiltonian (2.1), and leads to an equivalent formulation of this Hamiltonian. If one\nconsiders it as a variational parameter rather than an operator, as in the AFM, the results\nare approximate but can be analytical. We have shown in this section that the auxiliary\nfield, when seen as a variational parameter, is nothing else than the function a(t) generating\nthe tangential potential in ET. This shows that, although obtained in different ways, the\nAFM and the ET lead to the same results. In this way, some formulae about the power-law\n\n\f97\npotentials obtained in Ref. 103) by the ET were rediscovered with the AFM in Ref. 38), but\nsupplementary results are given in this last reference.\nTaking this equivalence into account, we can now better understand the meaning of the\nvariational parameter v in the ET: Its optimal value can be seen as given by a mean field\napproximation since Z(v0 ) = hZ(g\u2032 (P(r0 )))i (see (2.19)). Moreover, the properties of the\nAFM that have been proven in Refs. 38),40) also hold for ET. Finally, we can now have an a\npriori knowledge of the (anti)variational nature of the AFM energy formulae provided that\nwe express V (r) as g(P(r)) and compute whether g is convex or concave. Equivalently, since\nthe potential \u1e7c (r, \u03bd0 ) is tangent to the potential V (r) at r = r0 , the approximation E(\u03bd0 ) is an\nupper (lower) bound on the exact energy if \u1e7c (r, \u03bd0 ) \u2265 V (r) (\u1e7c (r, \u03bd0 ) \u2264 V (r)) for all values\nof r.46) All these results holds provided that H and H\u0303(\u03bd0 ) have the same kinetic part.

Complements of information can be\nfound in Ref. 104). First of all, W (z) is defined as the inverse function of z ez . Consequently,\nit has the following properties:\nW (z) eW (z) = W (z ez ) = z,\n\n\u2202z W (z) =\n\nW (z)\n.\nz [1 +W (z)]\n\n(C.1)\n(C.2)\n\nBut, it is readily observed that the inverse function of z ez is multivalued.

Obviously, both\nbranches of the Lambert function share the same properties (C.1) and (C.2) as W (z); they\nmeet in W\u22121 (\u22121/e) = W0 (\u22121/e) = \u22121.

In this method the degrees of freedom are simply the positions\nr i of the various particles (i = 1, . . . , N). But, in this case, the motion of the center of mass\nis not separated correctly and this leads to spurious components which spoil the results.\nOn the contrary, in the few-body problem, one introduces new degrees of freedom which\nallow to solve exactly this important drawback. Among the various possible new degrees\nof freedom, the Jacobi coordinates are of common use. First, we choose a reference mass\nm (it can be that of a particle or the total mass of the system for example) and define the\ndimensionless quantities \u03b1i = mi /m, \u03b112...i = \u2211ik=1 \u03b1k and \u03b1 = \u03b112...N .

The kinematical quantities \u03bbi are calculated as\n\n\u03bbi =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b112...i+1\n\u03b1i+1 \u03b112...i\n\n\u00131/2\n\n.\n\n(J.3)\n\nFor further convenience, it is judicious to switch from the standard Jacobi variables to renormalized conjugate Jacobi coordinates defined as\nyi =\n\nxi\n;\n\u03bbi\n\n\u03c1 i = \u03bbi \u03c0 i .\n\n(J.4)\n\n\f105\nP = 0 ) and using these new variables, the kinetic\nWorking in the center of mass frame (P\nenergy operator has a very simple form\nT=\n\n1 N\u22121 2\n\u2211 \u03c1i .\n2m i=1\n\n(J.5)\n\nWith these new variables, the one-body operator is written\nN\n\nV1 = \u2211 ai (rr i \u2212 R )2 =\ni=1\n\nN\u22121\n\n\u2211\n\nl,m=1\n\nFlm y l * y m ,\n\n(J.6)\n\nwhere the symmetric definite positive matrix F is defined by\nN\n\nFlm = \u03bbl \u03bbm \u2211 ai Bil Bim ,\n\n(J.7)\n\ni=1\n\nthe matrix B being given by (I.3). In the very same way, the two-body operator is written\nN\n\nV2 =\n\n\u2211\n\nbi j (rr i \u2212 r j )2 =\n\ni< j=1\n\nN\u22121\n\n\u2211\n\nl,m=1\n\nGlm y l * y m\n\n(J.8)\n\nwhere the symmetric definite positive matrix G is defined by\nN\n\nGlm = \u03bbl \u03bbm\n\n\u2211\n\ni< j=1\n\nbi j (Bil \u2212 B jl )(Bim \u2212 B jm ).\n\n(J.9)\n\nIntroducing the matrix J = F + G, the total potential V = V1 +V2 is expressed as\nN\u22121\n\nV=\n\n\u2211\n\nl,m=1\n\nJlm y l * y m .\n\n(J.10)\n\nFor arbitrary masses or/and spring constants there is no reason why the matrix J should\nbe diagonal. However, this matrix being a symmetric definite positive matrix, it can be\ndiagonalized with help of a unitary matrix (in fact an orthogonal one since all the quantities\nare real). Thus\nJ = O\u22121 DO, with O\u22121 = \u00d5.\n(J.11)\nThe elements of the diagonal matrix D are all positive (due to definiteness) and are chosen\nunder the form di = m\u03c9i2 /2.\nThe last step is an ultimate change of conjugate variables\nN\u22121\n\nzl =\n\n\u2211\n\nj=1\n\nOl j y j ;\n\n\u03c3l =\n\nN\u22121\n\n\u2211 Ol j \u03c1 j .\n\n(J.12)\n\nj=1\n\nExpressed with these new variables, the original Hamiltonian (J.1) appears to be the sum of\nN \u2212 1 decoupled harmonic oscillators\n\u0015\nN\u22121 \u0014 2\n\u03c3i 1\n2 2\nHho = \u2211\n+ m\u03c9i z i ,\n(J.13)\n2\ni=1 2m\n\n\f106\nand consequently the energy of the system is given by\nN\u22121\n\nEho =\n\n\u2211 \u03c9i (2ni + li + 3/2),\n\n(J.14)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere ni and li are respectively the radial and orbital quantum numbers associated to the\ncoordinate z i . The problem is now completely solved. Moreover, this result is valid for any\nexcited state. Even if the expression of \u03c9i is in general not analytical, the result (J.14) is\nexact and could be calculated with a high accuracy. Notice that formula (J.14) extends a\nprevious result,107), 108) where an equivalent mass formula is obtained in the case ai = 0. An\nexplicit result for the case N = 3 is given in Ref. 68).\nJ.2. Case of identical particles\nIt is of interest to rewrite the solution in the case where all the particles are identical,\nimplying that they have the same mass mi = m and the same spring constants ai = a, bi j = b.\nHamiltonian (J.1) indeed reads in this case\nN\n\nN\nN\np 2i\n+ a \u2211 (rr i \u2212 R )2 + b \u2211 (rr i \u2212 r j )2 ,\ni=1 2m\ni< j=1\ni=1\n\nHho = \u2211\n\n(J.15)\n\nand it is easy to see that the J matrix is already of diagonal from the very beginning, so that its\neigenvalues are analytically known (they all read a + Nb). Consequently, the eigenenergies\nof the system are also analytical. Explicitly they are given by\nr\n2\nEho =\n(a + Nb) Q,\n(J.16)\nm\nwhere Q is the total principal number\nN\u22121\n\nQ=\n\n3\n\n\u2211 (2ni + li) + 2 (N \u2212 1).\n\n(J.17)\n\ni=1\n\nWavefunction with good global quantum numbers and various symmetries can be built\nby appropriate linear combinations of states characterized by the same value of the principal\nquantum number Q.91) All symmetrized states have then the same energy than the nonsymmetrized states. For spatial wave functions completely symmetrical, the ground state is\nobtained for the values ni = li = 0 \u2200i so that the principal quantum number is simply\n3\nQSGS = (N \u2212 1).\n2\n\n(J.18)\n\nFor mixed symmetry or completely antisymmetrical spatial wavefunctions, the situation is\nmuch more involved. An estimation of the ground-state energy for the completely antisymmetrical case can be computed by choosing different values for the quantum numbers and\npiling the states (d identical values of the same n j and l j per state in order to take care of a\npossible degeneracy due to internal degrees of freedom) up to the Fermi level. By considering only particle number insuring a saturated Fermi level (closed shell), one obtains\n3\nQAGS = (N \u2212 1)(B f + 2),\n4\n\n(J.19)\n\n\f107\nwhere B f , the band number of the Fermi level, is the real positive solution of\nd\nN \u2212 1 = (B f + 1)(B f + 2)(B f + 3).\n6\n\n(J.20)\n\nAsymptotically, we have\nlim QAGS =\n\nN\u226b1\n\n\u0012\n\n81\n32\n\n\u00131/3\n\nN 4/3\n.\nd 1/3\n\n(J.21)\n\nJ.3. Relativistic case\nLet us now treat the relativistic generalization of (J.15), namely\nN\n\nHho = \u2211\n\ni=1\n\nq\n\nN\n\nN\n\np 2i + m2 + a \u2211 (rr i \u2212 R )2 + b\ni=1\n\n\u2211\n\n(rr i \u2212 r j )2 ,\n\n(J.22)\n\ni< j=1\n\nby the AFM. Extremization formula (6.63) can be written 4X 4 \u2212 8X \u2212 3Y = 0 with\nY=\n\n4m2\n3\n\n\u0012\n\n2N 2\n(a + Nb)Q2\n\n\u00132/3\n\n.\n\n(J.23)\n\nThe only positive root of this last equation is given by X = G\u2212 (Y ) (see Sect. B.2). Finally,\nmass formula (6.64) becomes\nr\nmt\n3\n(4G\u2212 (Y ) +Y )\nMho (\u03bc0 ) =\nY 2G\u2212 (Y )2\n\u0014\n\u0015\n2mt\n1\n2\n+ G\u2212 (Y ) .\n=\u221a\n(J.24)\n3Y G\u2212 (Y )\nNotice the simple ultrarelativistic limit\nlim Mho (\u03bc0 ) =\n\nm\u21920\n\n\u00031/3\n3\u0002\n.\n2N(a + Nb)Q2\n2\n\n(J.25)\n\nThe duality relations presented in Sect. 6.5 can be easily tested with relations (J.16), (J.24)\nand (J.25).\nReferences\n1)\n2)\n3)\n4)\n5)\n6)\n7)\n8)\n9)\n10)\n\nW.
