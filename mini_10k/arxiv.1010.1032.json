Tranist observations and follow-up\nradial velocity data strongly constrain the planets radii, masses and inclinations.\nSuch accurate physical parameters then allow investigation of the internal structures of these planets and possible clues to their formation mechanisms. The\nmajority of transiting ESP (TESP) have masses below 1.5MJ , although there\nare several at masses near 3MJ (e.g. WASP-10, HD 17156, and CoRoT-2) and\na similar number above 3MJ , but even with higher mass objects like the 7.3\nMJ WASP-14b (Joshi et al. 2008) and 8 MJ HD 147506b (Sato et al. 2005) this\nhigher mass region has been poorly explored. Most TESP had radii near 1RJ ,\nbut many TESP had radii \u2248 10% larger than expected for their mass, like\nHD 209458b (Brown et al. 2001; Vidal-Madjar et al. 2003).\nThere have been several attempts to explain these larger than expected\nradii. Baraffe et al. (2003) found irradiation effects could significantly alter the\nradii of sub-jovain mass giant planets, but not explain the large radii for the\nplanets with radii greater than 1.2RJ , such as HD 209458b. Additional authors have also considered inflation due to irradiation effects (Burrows et al.\n1\n\n\f2\n2000; Fortney et al. 2007) or other effects, like tidal forcing (Bodenheimer et al.\n2003), and internal dissipation of tidal energy arising from orbital circularization (Bodenheimer et al. 2001) but a consensus on an explanation for the inflated\nradii of these planets has not be reached. Regardless of these mass-radius discrepancies, photometric surveys have now provided a large sample of transiting\nESP that can be used to determine their mass-radius relation and test current\nmodels for the structure and composition of ESP.\nA recent parameterization to investigate possible classes of ESP has been\npresented by Hansen & Barman (2007) using the Safronov number for each system derived from the planet's equilibrium temperature, which is a function of its\ndistance from its host star and the host stars effective temperature and radius.\nIn this paper we present Safronov numbers for the current sample of transiting\nexoplanets (TESP) and a comparison of this sample to some of the latest models for mass-radus relationships for exoplanets. We selected the 100+ transiting\nextra-solar planets (TESP) listed in the Extrasolar planet encyclopedia1 as of\nOctober 2010.\n2\n\nResults & Discussion\n\nWe plot the Safronov number as a function of equilibrium temperature for the\ncurrent sample of TESP in Figure 1. Planets such as, HD 189733, TrES-3,\nHAT-P-7, and XO-4 can be seen in range of Safronov number between \u22480.06\nto 0.08, noted as class I. ESP such as, GJ 436, WASP-11b, HD 209458b, and\nHD 149026b fall in Class II with Safronov number \u22480.03 to 0.05. There are a\nhandful of plants have Safronov numbers higher than those of Class II shown in\nFigure 1 and these include WASP-7b and CoROT-Exo-2, and massive planets\nsuch as WASP-14b and HAT-P-2 (HD 147506b) are located off of the plot at\nSafronov numbers greater than 0.3. The figure clearly shows these 2 classes\nnoted by Hansen & Barman (2007).\nOur plot of the Safronov number as a function of equilibrium temperature\n(Figure 1) does clearly show two classed of TESP. However, the significance of\nthe gap observed in the Safronov numbers is still under scrutiny. Southworth\n(2008) notes that since Hansen & Barman (2007), additional extrasolar planet\ndiscoveries has led to the gap between the two classes of extrasolar planets weakening, and questions the statistical significance of the gap in Safronov numbers.\nA more thorough evaluation of Safronov numbers, by Fressin et al. (2009), contends that the gap is not presently statistically significant. Fressin et al. (2009)\nalso comment that there is no bimodal distribution of the two classes present\nin any other properties of extrasolar planets, raising questions as to if there\nactually are two separate classes of planets. More recently, Southworth 2010\nclaims there is no significance to Safronov numbers. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov\ntest shows a low but significant deviation for Class I of 0.4 (K-S statistic) and\nClass II of 0.62 from the entire sample of 100 TESP planets, respectively.\nComparison of current models for mass-radius relations (Burrows et al.\n1997; Baraffe et al. 2003; Bodenheimer et al. 2003; Fortney et al. 2007) to the\n\n1\n\nwww.exoplanet.eu\n\n\f3\n\nFigure 1. Plot of the Safronov number for the current sample of transiting\nextra-solar planets (as of April 2010) as a function of each planet's equilibrium\ntemperature. Class I planets with Safronov numbers in the \u22480.06 to 0.08\nrange are shown as red squares. Class II planets with Safronov numbers in\nthe \u22480.03 to 0.05 range are shown as blue triangles. Lastly. ESP outside of\nthese 2 ranges are shown as green circles (see text).\n\ncurrent sample of TESP (Figure 2) shows that the largest core masses have the\nsmallest planetary radii and can be ruled out by the current sample of ESP. A\nfew ESP in the current sample are consistent with 10 M\u2295 cores for the smallest objects and several ESP with radii near \u22481 RJ have masses consistent with\nmodes with no core mass. However, planets with radii > 1.2 RJ are inconsistent with the model behavior and may indicate another mechanism that inflates\ntheir radii (Mardling and references therein 2007). Curiously planets with radii\nin the \u22481.3\u20131.5 RJ range do lie along the Bodenheimer et al. (2003) models.\nThe M-R plots hints there are two classes of ESP, those with moderate\ncore masses and \u22641.2 RJ and a second class of inflated ESP with radii >1.2\nRJ that are yet to be explained, although these may indicate another formation\nmechanism. The usefulness of Safronov numbers is still being investigated.\nAcknowledgments.
