Two agents may interact and reach consensus, and additionally, individual agents may spontaneously change their opinions by a random, diffusive process.\nWe find three distinct possibilities. For strong diffusion, the distribution of opinions is uniform and\nno political organizations (parties) are formed.

Without diffusion,\na pattern develops: parties have the same size and they possess equal niches. These phenomena are\nanalyzed using pattern formation and scaling techniques.\nPACS numbers: 02.50.Ey, 05.45.-a, 89.65.-s, 89.75.-k\n\nInteracting particle systems and agent-based models\nare becoming increasingly important in the behavioral,\nsocial, and political sciences [1, 2]. There is compelling\nevidence that collective phenomena emerging in social\ncontexts can be attributed to basic agent-agent interactions [3]. Statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics\nmethods naturally apply for analysis of simplified interacting particle systems. Paradigms such as scaling, criticality, and universality, emerging from such quantitative analysis, can guide and validate detailed agent-based\nmodels, used to simulate real-world situations.\nIn opinion dynamics, recent studies focus on the emergence of cooperative phenomena including spatial organization, the formation of coherent structures (political parties), and the transition from unity to discord\n[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. In particular, the remarkably simple compromise process, in which pairs of agents reach\na fair compromise, captures familiar political systems:\none-party, two-party, etc, [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16].\nThis investigation generalizes the compromise process\nby allowing individual agents to change their opinions in\na random, diffusive fashion. It is shown that diffusion is\nan essential element of opinion dynamics. It generates\nrealistic lifecycles of political organizations and additionally, it governs the transition from a disorganized to an\norganized political system.\nThe competition between compromise and diffusion is\nquantified by one parameter, the diffusion constant. For\nstrong randomness, the political system is disorganized\nand the distribution of opinions is uniform. For weak\nrandomness, political organizations do form and they\nevolve constantly. Large parties overtake smaller ones\nand the separation between neighboring parties grows\nindefinitely. Without randomness, a stationary pattern\nwith evenly-spaced, evenly-sized parties forms.\nIn our model, the opinion of an agent is quantified by\nan integer n, and it changes via two separate processes.\nThe first is compromise. Two randomly selected agents\nreach consensus, provided that their opinion difference is\n\nsmaller than a fixed threshold, set to two for simplicity,\n1\n\n(n \u2212 1, n + 1) \u2212\u2192 (n, n).\n\n(1)\n\nThe compromise process occurs at a constant rate, set to\n1. The second process is diffusion. An agent may change\nhis or her opinion in a random fashion,\nD\n\nn \u2212\u2192 n \u00b1 1.\n\n(2)\n\nThis is merely diffusion, a random walk in opinion space\nwith D the diffusion constant. Of course, the total population is conserved. The total opinion is strictly conserved in compromise events, but it is conserved only on\naverage for diffusive moves.\nThe compromise process mimics the human tendency\nfor resolving conflicts [3], and the threshold incorporates\na certain degree of conviction in one's own opinion. Diffusion accounts for the possibility that people may change\ntheir opinion either on their own or due to news events,\neditorials, etc.\nThe density Pn (t) of agents with opinion n at time t\nobeys the master equation\ndPn\n= 2Pn\u22121 Pn+1 \u2212 Pn (Pn\u22122 + Pn+2 )\ndt\n+ D(Pn\u22121 + Pn+1 \u2212 2Pn ).\n\n(3)\n\nThe\nP the total opinion are conserved:\nP total population and\nP\n=\nconst\nand\nn\nn nPn = const. We analyze in\nn\norder one-party, two-party, and multi-party dynamics.\nOne-party dynamics. Consider the initial condition\nPn (0) = m(\u03b4n,\u22121 +\u03b4n,0 ) with a well-defined political organization, namely, a party. Its size, equal to the total population, is taken to be large, m \u226b D. Clearly, throughout\nthe evolution, the opinion distribution remains symmetric, Pn = P1\u2212n . Equation (3) supports the trivial steadystate where the opinion distribution vanishes, Pn = 0, as\nwell as one in which compromise and diffusion balance\nPn\u22121 Pn+1 = DPn .\n\n(4)\n\n\f2\n400\n\n10\n\n3\n\n1\n\nsimulation\ntheory\n\n300\n0.5\n\n10\n\nPn\n\n10\n\n10\n\nPn\n\n0\n\n0\n-8\n\n-4\n\n0\n\n4\n\n200\n100\n\n8\n\n0\n\n-3\n\n0.008\n\nPn\n\n-6\n\n0.006\n0.004\n0.002\n0\n0\n\n-9\n\n10 -12\n\n-8\n\n-4\n\n0\n\nn\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\nFIG. 1: One-party dynamics. Shown is Pn (t = 1) for m =\n103 . The theoretical prediction for the core (5) is shown for\nreference. The inset, where \u03a6(z) is plotted versus z = nt\u22121/2 ,\nshows the scaling behavior of the tail at large times t = 103\n(circles) and t = 104 (line).\n\nSolving\nthis\nequation\nrecursively\nwith\nP\u22121\n=\nP0\ngives\nthe\nperiodic\nstate\n(P\u22121 , P0 , P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 ) = (P0 , P0 , D, D2 /P0 , D2 /P0 , D),\nwith Pn = Pn+6 . Starting with the one-party initial\ncondition, the distribution has a localized core that\nmatches this periodic structure over a few lattice sites,\n(P0 , P1 , P2 ) \u223c\n= (m, D, D2 m\u22121 ).\n\n(5)\n\nThis is confirmed by numerical integration of (3), as\nshown in figure 1 [17]. Using the conservation law\nP0 + P1 + P2 \u223c\n= m, Eq. (5) can be refined (P0 , P1 , P2 ) \u223c\n=\n2 \u22121\n(m\u2212D, D, D m ). The core is established very quickly:\nfrom the short time behavior, Pn (t) \u223c\n= m (Dt)n , we immediately deduce the stabilization time scale m\u22121 . The\nlarger the party, the faster it is shaped.\nOutside the core, diffusion dominates over compromise\nsince P 2 \u226a DP when P \u226a D. The tail obeys the diffusion equation dPn /dt = D(Pn\u22121 + Pn+1 \u2212 2Pn ) for n \u2265 2\nwith the boundary condition P2 (t) = D2 m\u22121 ; this is the\nstandard problem of diffusion with a source [18]. Consequently, the tail is characterized by the diffusive length\nscale l \u223c t1/2 and its shape is asymptotically self-similar\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(6)\nPn (t) \u2192 m\u22121 \u03a6 n t\u22121/2\nwith \u03a6(0) = const. Henceforth, the explicit dependence\non the diffusion\nP constant is dropped. The tail population, \u03bc = 2 n\u22652 Pn , grows with time according to\n\u03bc \u223c m\u22121 t1/2 . Eventually, the entire population is transferred from the core to the tail and the party dissolves.\nThe lifetime of the party \u03c4 is estimated from \u03bc \u223c m to\nbe\n\u03c4 \u223c m4 .\n\n(7)\n\n20\n\n40\n\nn\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nFIG. 2: Two-party dynamics. Shown are results of numerical\nintegration with m1 = 2m2 = 200 and l = 90 at an early time\nt = 103 (solid lines) and a later time t = 2 \u00d7 105 (dashed\nlines). The top plot shows the cores, and the bottom plot\nshows the tail.\n\nThis time scale grows rapidly with the party size, indicating that diffusive loss is negligible over a substantial\nperiod and that large parties are long-lived.\nIn summary, a single party has a quasi-stationary state\nconsisting of a fixed, tightly confined core and an extended diffusive tail. Over its lifetime, the core of the\nparty is immobile and it is unaffected by the random\nchanges in position of its affiliates. The core contains\nthe bulk of the population, its hight equals the party\nsize and its depth is inversely proportional to the size.\nUltimately, an isolated party dissolves. Its remnant is\na diffusive cloud centered at the original party position\nwith total population equal to the initial party size.\nTwo-party dynamics. To find out how two neighboring\nparties interact, we consider the initial condition Pn =\nm1 (\u03b4n,\u22122 + \u03b4n,\u22123 ) + m2 (\u03b4n+2,l + \u03b4n+3,l+1 ) corresponding\nto two large parties, m1 , m2 \u226b D, that are separated by\na large distance l \u226b 1.\nInitially, the parties do not interact and each one follows the one-party dynamics above. When their diffusive tails meet, which occurs on the diffusive time scale\nl2 , the distribution reaches a steady-state in the region\nseparating the two. It obeys the discrete Laplace equation Pn+1 + Pn\u22121 \u2212 2Pn = 0 with the boundary condi\u22121\ntions dictated by the two cores P0 \u221d m\u22121\n1 and Pl \u221d m2 .\nTherefore, there is a linear profile (figure 2)\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nn\n1\n1\n+\n\u2212\n(8)\nPn \u221d\nm1\nm2\nm1 l\nfor 0 \u2264 n \u2264 l. As a result, there is a slow and\nsteady flux from the smaller party into the larger one,\n\u22121\nJ = |Pn+1 \u2212 Pn |, or explicitly J \u221d l\u22121 (m\u22121\n< \u2212 m> ) with\nm< = min (m1 , m2 ) and m> = max (m1 , m2 ). We note\nthat diffusion enables the two parties to interact. The\nflux is proportional to the difference in depth, and it is\n\n\f3\ng\n\nh\n\n60\n\ni\n\n50\n40\n\ne\n\nf\n\nm\n\nd\n\n30\n20\n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\n10\n0\n400\n\nFIG. 3: Multi-party dynamics. Shown are representative\nsnapshots for D = 3 (a-c), D = 1 (d-f), and D = 0 (g-i)\nat an early time (left), intermediate time (middle), and late\ntime (right). Shown is Pn versus n using lines (D = 3, D = 0).\nAlso shown is the total party size and position using bars with\nhight equal to the party size (D = 1, D = 0). The plots are\nresults of numerical integration of (3) with \u01eb = 0.1 for D 6= 0\nand \u01eb = 0 for D = 0.\n\ninversely proportional to the separation. Eventually, the\nsmall party is depleted. The depletion time can be estimated from the flux, T \u223c m< /J, as\nT \u223c l m2<\n\n(9)\n\nwhere the dependence on the larger population was\ntacitly ignored. An improved estimate for the depletion time can be obtained from the evolution equations\ndm> /dt = \u2212dm< /dt = J.\nWe conclude that there is a steady flux from the small\nparty into its neighboring larger party resulting in the\neventual demise of the smaller party. Thus, the result\nof the interaction is deterministic as it always leads to\nmerger. The lifetime of the small party grows quadratically with its size. It also increases linearly with the\nseparation or \"niche\". While the larger party grows during the merger, this growth does not affect its position;\nit is practically immobile.\nMulti-party dynamics. The uniform state Pn = const is\nstationary. Any uniform state can be transformed by an\nappropriate rescaling of the opinion distribution, time,\nand the diffusion constant into the state Pn = 1, so\nwe address this case. To investigate the stability of the\nuniform state, we considered heterogeneous initial conditions with Pn (0) a randomly chosen number in the range\n[\u22121\u2212\u01eb, 1+\u01eb] with \u01eb \u226a 1. The system is large, 1 \u2264 n \u2264 N\nwith N \u226b 1.\nStability of the uniform state is studied using small\nperiodic perturbations, Pn = 1 + \u03c6n , with \u03c6n \u221d eikn+\u03bbt .\nFrom (3), the growth rate is\n\u03bb = 2(2 cos k \u2212 cos 2k \u2212 1) + 2D(cos k \u2212 1).\n\n(10)\n\n500\n\nn\n\n600\n\nFIG. 4: The party size m versus position n. Shown are results\nof numerical integration of (3) with D = 1, N = 103 , and\n\u01eb = 0.1 at times t = 103 (solid line) and t = 104 (dashed\nline). The bar hight equals the party size.\n\nThe perturbation decays if its wave-number is sufficiently\nlarge, |k| > k0 with k0 = cos\u22121 (D/2).\nUniform Distribution. Since k0 = 0 for D = 2, there is a\ncritical diffusivity\nDc = 2.\n\n(11)\n\nFor strong diffusion, D > Dc , perturbations decay exponentially with time and the uniform state is rapidly\nrestored, regardless of the initial conditions (figures 3a3c). Just above the critical diffusivity, long wavelength\nperturbations are long lived: their decay time diverges\n\u221d (D \u2212Dc )\u22122 , following from \u03bb \u221d (D \u2212Dc ) k 2 as D \u2193 Dc .\nIn any case, compromise interactions become irrelevant\nand diffusion dominates. As a result, the opinion distribution approaches a structureless state: the political\nsystem is disorganized as no parties are formed.\nCoarsening. For weak diffusion, D < Dc , perturbations\nto the initial state are magnified and parties are quickly\nformed (figure 3d-3f). The system develops a mosaic of\nparties. Since the initial state is heterogeneous, the size\nof the parties and the separation between them vary. The\nevolution follows straightforwardly from the two-party\ndynamics and there is a linear profile in regions separating parties. Small parties merge into larger neighboring\nparties, and as a result, the remaining parties grow in\nsize and in niche (figure 4).\nLet us assume that the typical size is m. The population density must be constant, so the typical niche is\nof the same order, l \u223c m. Substituting these scales into\nthe depletion time (9) yields T \u223c m3 and since time is\nthe only relevant time scale, the typical size growth law\nis (figure 5)\nm \u223c t1/3 .\n\n(12)\n\nAsymptotically, the system reaches a self-similar state\nwhere the party size is characterized by the typi-\n\n\f4\n2\n\n10\n\nm(t)\n\nsimulation\nslope=1/3\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\nt\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n5\n\nFIG. 5: The average party size versus time. Shown are simulation results (solid line) obtained using D = 1 and N = 105\nand a line of slope = 1/3 (dashed line) for reference.\n\nThe solution is k = kselect + i\u03bb with the selected wave\nnumber kselect = 1.183032. The decay constant \u03bb =\n0.467227 characterizes the exponential decay far into the\nunstable state, \u03c6n \u223c exp[\u2212\u03bb(n \u2212 vt)]. The propagation\nvelocity is v = 3.807397 and the period of the pattern is\nLselect = 2\u03c0/kselect = 5.311086. Our numerical studies\nconfirm these results.\nIn the absence of boundaries, i.e., in a periodic system, the perturbation with the largest growth rate dominates and sets the wavelength. From (10), the growth\nrate is \u03bb = 2(2 cos k \u2212 cos 2k \u2212 1); it is periodic in k,\n\u03bb(k) = \u03bb(k + 2\u03c0). The uniform state is unstable with\nrespect to long wavelength perturbations with k < \u03c0/2.\nAlso, the growth rate is maximal at kmax = \u03c0/3 and the\ncorresponding period, Lmax = 2\u03c0/kmax , is Lmax = 6.\nNumerically, we find that the actual period falls between the two linear stability values\nL \u2248 5.67.\n\ncal scale m and consequently, the party size distribution, Qm , becomes self-similar in the long time limit,\nQm \u223c t\u22121/3 \u03a8(mt\u22121/3 ). Our numerical simulations confirm this, along with (12).\nThe lifetime of a party is governed by the interplay\nbetween size and niche. Typically, the larger the party,\nthe longer it survives, but a small party may still outlast\na larger neighbor if it has a large enough niche. Except\nfor this size-niche competition, the coarsening mechanism\nis similar to Lifshitz-Slyozov ripening [19].\nPattern Formation. Without diffusion, the system approaches a state where Pn\u22121 Pn+1 = 0 for all n; there\nis no evolution and parties are localized to either one or\ntwo sites [15]. For a narrow political spectrum, consensus is reached and there is a single party. As the size of\nthe spectrum increases, the number of parties undergoes\na series of bifurcations and there may be two off-center\nparties, three parties, etc [10, 15].\nAsymptotically, the number of parties grows linearly\nwith the political spectrum N because the parties are\nequally-spaced (figure 3i). The spacing equals the party\nsize, as follows from conservation of population. This\npattern formation can be understood using linear stability analysis. We demonstrate this for uniform initial\ndistributions.\nConsider the uniform initial condition: Pn (0) = 0 for\nn < 0 and Pn (0) = 1 for n \u2265 0. This state is unstable\nwith respect to perturbations that propagate from the\nboundary into the unstable uniform state (figures 3g-3i).\nA small periodic disturbance Pn = 1 + \u03c6n with \u03c6n \u221d\nexp[i(kn \u2212 \u03c9t)] is characterized by the dispersion relation\n\u03c9 = 2i(2 cos k \u2212 cos 2k \u2212 1) according to the diffusion-free\nevolution equation (3). A saddle point analysis shows\nthat the propagation velocity v obeys [20]\nv=\n\nIm[w]\nd\u03c9\n=\n.\ndk\nIm[k]\n\n(13)\n\n(14)\n\nStarting from a compact distribution, perturbations with\nthe selected period are generated by the boundary and\nthey propagate into the interior. As the disturbance\nreaches the interior of the system, perturbations with a\nsmaller wavelength, that have a larger growth rate, dominate. This argument suggests the above estimates as\nbounds for the period Lselect < L < Lmax . These bounds\nare tight, so linear stability analysis yields a very good\napproximation for the period. Yet, the pattern selection\nmechanism is intrinsically nonlinear and obtaining the\nexact period remains a challenge.\nIn summary, we found that the level of noise (diffusion)\ndetermines the nature of the political system. Strong\nnoise leads to a uniform distribution of opinions with every possible opinion equal in weight. With weak noise,\nthe system organizes into political parties and the political landscape undergoes coarsening with large parties\ncontinuously overtaking small ones. Without noise, the\nsystem evolves into a frozen pattern of parties with equal\nweights and equal separations.\nSeveral qualitative features are surprisingly realistic.\nThe lifecycle of a party includes formation, growth, and\ndemise. Isolated parties have a fixed position and their\nlifetime grows rapidly with their size, but ultimately, any\nparty dissolves. When two parties interact, the smaller\nparty loses ground to the larger party at a steady rate.\nA small party with a large niche can be long lived.\nDiffusion plays a critical role. It facilitates interaction\nbetween parties and it is responsible for the dissolution\nof parties. Moreover, the patterned state is unstable with\nrespect to addition of diffusion. We conclude that spontaneous opinion changes are an integral part of opinion\ndynamics.\nI thank M. Cross, P. L. Krapivksy, S. Redner, and\nL. Tsimring for useful discussions.
