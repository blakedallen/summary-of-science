We extract the quark condensate from the operator product\nexpansion of the quark propagator at short euclidean distances, where it represents the leading contribution in the chiral limit. From this study we obtain\nhq\u0304qiMS (2 GeV) = \u2212(265 \u00b1 5 \u00b1 22 MeV)3 , in good agreement with determinations of\nthis quantity based on different approaches. The simulation is performed by using\nthe O(a)-improved Wilson action at \u03b2 = 6.45 on a volume 323 \u00d7 70 in the quenched\napproximation.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nAn accurate determination of the chiral quark condensate is a task of prime interest. Its\nnon-vanishing value signals the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in QCD and,\nquantitatively, it is related to the pseudo-Goldstone bosons mass spectrum.\nDue to the purely non-perturbative nature of the quark condensate, its estimate is\nrather challenging. Traditional approaches have been based on QCD sum rules (a review\nof these techniques can be found in refs. [1, 2]). In the last years, first principle determinations of the quark condensate have been provided by Lattice QCD calculations, and\nthe accuracy of these results is expected to systematically improve in time. The standard\nmethod to extract the quark condensate from lattice calculations exploits the well known\nGMOR formula [3]-[6]. Alternative techniques have been also investigated, based on the\n\u01eb-expansion of QCD in a small volume [7]-[9] and on the study of the Goldstone pole\ncontribution to the pseudoscalar quark Green function [10, 11].\nIn this paper, we present an exploratory Lattice QCD determination of the chiral\nquark condensate based on a new method. We study the quark propagator in coordinate\nspace and its operator product expansion (OPE) [12] at short euclidean distances. The\nOPE is a powerful technique that systematically includes non-perturbative corrections\nand parameterizes the non-trivial properties of the QCD vacuum in terms of condensates [13]. We extract the quark condensate h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8i by evaluating the quark propagator at\nshort distances on the lattice, and comparing the result with the OPE prediction,\nS(x) \u223c CI (x)\n\nm\nx\n/\n+ Cm (x) 2 + C\u03c8\u0304\u03c8 (x) h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8i + . . .\n2\n2\n(x )\nx\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the dots represent higher powers of x2 and of the quark mass m.1 Our final result\nfor the chiral quark condensate, renormalized in the MS scheme at the scale \u03bc = 2 GeV,\nis\n(2)\nhq\u0304qiMS (2 GeV) = \u2212(265 \u00b1 5 \u00b1 22 MeV)3 ,\nwhere the first error is statistical and the second systematic. This result is in good\nagreement with those obtained from the other methods listed above. It also provides a\nremarkable non-perturbative test of the OPE predictions at short distance in QCD.\nThe OPE of the quark propagator can be also performed in momentum space, from\nwhich a determination of the quark condensate might be possible as well. When working\non the lattice with Wilson fermions, however, the leading contribution to the OPE in\nmomentum space is a constant term induced by discretization effects. Though vanishing\nin the continuum limit, this term is dominant at fixed lattice spacing with respect to the\nmass and the condensate contributions, whose coefficients are suppressed by 1/p2 and 1/p4\nrespectively [14]. In coordinate space this major obstacle is bypassed, since the Fourier\ntransform of the unphysical term is a discretized delta function, whose effect is negligible\nat distances larger than few lattice spacings.\nAnother advantage of the approach studied in this paper is that it greatly simplifies the\nrenormalization procedure. Specifically, once the quark propagator on the l.h.s. of eq. (1)\n1\n\nThroughout this paper we use the notation x =\n\n\u221a\nx2 .\n\n1\n\n\fis renormalized, all contributions appearing on the r.h.s. turn out to be expressed in terms\nof renormalized quantities. In particular, the determination of the chiral quark condensate\nin this approach does not require the evaluation of the corresponding renormalization\nconstant.\nThe applicability of the OPE to correlation functions evaluated on the lattice at fixed\nvalue of the lattice spacing a relies on the existence of a short distance region where the\nconditions\na<\n(3)\n\u223cx<\n\u223c 1/\u039bQCD\n\nare both satisfied. The upper bound in eq. (3) guarantees that the Wilson coefficients\nentering the OPE at the typical scale \u03bc = 1/x can be evaluated in perturbation theory.\nThe lower bound must be satisfied in order to keep under control discretization effects.\nIn the present study, though we use an O(a)-improved action and the value of the inverse\nlattice spacing is as large as a\u22121 \u2243 4 GeV, we find that in the region x <\n\u223c 1/\u039bQCD\ndiscretization effects in the quark propagator are not negligible. These effects are in fact\nresponsible for most of the systematic uncertainty quoted in eq. (2). In order to reduce\ntheir contribution, we have followed a procedure similar to the one applied in ref. [15]:\nwe have corrected the lattice results for the quark propagator by the lattice artifacts\ncomputed in the free theory, thus reducing their size from O(a2 ) to O(\u03b1s a2 ).\nWe now summarize the procedure followed in this study and present the plan of the\npaper.\n\u2013 In sect.2, we derive the OPE of the quark propagator in coordinate space, by including\nQCD corrections up to the next-to-leading order (NLO).\n\u2013 Details of the lattice simulation are presented in sect.3, where the tree-level correction\nof lattice artifacts is also discussed.\n\u2013 In sect.4 we compute the renormalization constant of the quark propagator non-perturbatively in the X-space scheme. The X-space method has been proposed in ref. [16], and\napplied in [15] to compute the renormalization constants of bilinear quark operators. Our\nresult for the quark field renormalization constant, converted to the MS scheme, reads\nZ\u03c8MS (\u03bc = 2 GeV) = 0.871 \u00b1 0.003 \u00b1 0.020 ,\n\n(4)\n\nin good agreement with the result obtained in ref. [17] by using the non-perturbative\nRI-MOM method.\n\u2013 In sect.5 we evaluate the chiral quark condensate by fitting in coordinate space the quark\npropagator, extrapolated to the chiral limit, to its OPE. A second estimate is obtained by\nfirst using the OPE at finite values of the quark mass and then extrapolating the result to\nthe chiral limit. Different functional forms are considered in the fits, and the differences\namong the results are taken into account in the estimate of the systematic error. The two\napproaches give completely consistent results.\n\u2013 The final result quoted in eq. (2) is presented in sect.6, where we discuss in details the\nevaluation of the systematic error.\n\u2013 Finally, we sketch in the appendix the NLO QCD calculation of the Wilson coefficients\nentering in eq. (1)\n2\n\n\f2\n\nOPE of the quark propagator in coordinate space\n\nThe quark propagator can be expressed in terms of two scalar form factors, \u03a31 (x) and\n\u03a32 (x), which are defined from\nS(x) =\n\nx\n/\n1\n\u03a3\n(x)\n+\n\u03a32 (x).\n1\n(x2 )2\nx2\n\n(5)\n\nThe leading terms in the OPE of \u03a31 (x) and \u03a32 (x) can be read from eq. (1):\n1\nCI (x) + * * *\n2\u03c0 2\n1\n1\nCm (x) m \u2212\nC (x) h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8i x2 + * * *\n\u03a32 (x) =\n2\n4\u03c0\n4Nc \u03c8\u0304\u03c8\n\u03a31 (x) =\n\n(6)\n\nwhere, at variance with eq. (1), the Wilson coefficients CI (x), Cm (x) and C\u03c8\u0304\u03c8 (x) are\nnormalized to unity in the free theory. Nc is the number of colors and the quark condensate\nis defined as\nh\u03c8\u0304\u03c8i \u2261 h\u03c8\u0304i\u03b1 (0)\u03c8i\u03b1 (0)i ,\n(7)\n\nwhere a summation over repeated color and spin indices is understood.\nBy using the known two-loop results for the quark field and the quark mass anomalous\ndimensions in QCD, a simple one-loop calculation provides the renormalization group\nimproved expressions for the Wilson coefficients in eq.

(8) and\n(9) will be used in sects.4 and 5 to extract the quark field renormalization constant and\nthe chiral quark condensate with NLO accuracy in the MS scheme.\n\n3\n\nAnalysis of discretization effects\n\nIn this section we present the details of the lattice simulation, illustrate the results obtained for the bare quark propagator and discuss the free theory correction implemented\nin order to reduce the lattice artifacts.\nWe have generated 180 gauge configurations in the quenched approximation with the\nnon-perturbatively O(a)-improved Wilson action on a volume 323 \u00d7 70 at \u03b2 = 6.45. As a\nvalue of the inverse lattice spacing we use a\u22121 = 3.87(19) GeV, as obtained in ref. [19] from\nthe studies of the quark-antiquark potential [20] and by using in input the reference scale\na\u22121 (\u03b2 = 6.0) = 2.0(1) GeV.2 We have computed the quark propagator at four values of\nthe hopping parameter, \u03ba = 0.1349, 0.1351, 0.1352, 0.1353, corresponding to light quark\nmasses in the range ms /2 <\n\u223cm<\n\u223c ms . The corresponding values of the renormalized quark\nmasses have been obtained in ref. [19] from the study of both the vector and axial-vector\nWard identities, and are given in lattice units, in the MS scheme, in table 1. These values\nhave been used in the study of the OPE of the quark propagator and to perform the chiral\nextrapolations of the quantities we are interested in. The statistical errors quoted in this\npaper have been evaluated with the jackknife technique.\nWe have fixed the Landau gauge on the lattice by minimizing the quantity:\n\u03b8=\n2\n\n1 X\nTr [ \u2206\u03bc A\u03bc (x) \u2206\u03bd A\u03bd (x) ]\nV x\n\nHad we used in input r0 = 0.5 fm we would have obtained a\u22121 \u2243 4.10 GeV.\n\n4\n\n(12)\n\n\fwhere V is the lattice volume and \u2206\u03bc A\u03bc is the discretized version of the gauge field\ndivergence \u2202\u03bc A\u03bc . We have required \u03b8 \u2264 5.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 for all the configurations used in this\nstudy.\nIn order to compute the quark condensate and the quark field renormalization constant, we have extracted from the quark propagator in the Landau gauge the bare form\nfactors \u03a31 (x) and \u03a32 (x) defined in eq. (5). The results are shown in fig. 1(top) for\n\u03ba = 0.1349 as functions of (x/a)2 .\nLorentz invariance requires that, when approaching the continuum limit, the form\nfactors should become functions of x2 only. At fixed value of the lattice spacing, however,\nthe plots in fig. 1(top) show that points corresponding to the same value of (x/a)2 are\nsignificantly spreaded out. This is true especially at short distances ((x/a)2 <\n\u223c 10), where\ndiscretization effects are expected to be larger. A better understanding of these effects\ncan be obtained by studying the lattice quark propagator in the free theory. Indeed, in\nthe short distance region which is relevant for the X-space method the interacting theory\nis expected to approach the asymptotic free regime, up to small perturbative corrections.\nOne finds that \u03a31 (x) and \u03a32 (x), computed on the lattice in the free theory, present similar\ndeviations from the expected continuum behavior. The free theory results, obtained at\ninfinite volume and in the chiral limit, are shown in fig. 1(center), and they can be\ncompared with the lattice results shown in the top panels. This similarity suggests that\none can identify the discretization patterns in the free case in order to subtract them in\nthe interacting case of interest [15]. The practical implementation of this approach passes\nthrough the definition of the \"corrected\" form factors.\nIn the case of \u03a31 (x) we define\n\u03a3corr\n(x)\n1\n\n=\n\n\u03a3cont\n1, f ree (x)\nlat\n\u03a31, f ree (x)\n\n!\n\n\u03a31 (x) ,\n\n(13)\n\nlat\nwhere \u03a3cont\n1, f ree (x) and \u03a31, f ree (x) are the free theory form factors computed respectively in\nthe continuum and on the lattice, at infinite volume and in the chiral limit. For finite\nlat\nvalues of the lattice spacing, the difference of the ratio \u03a3cont\n1, f ree (x)/\u03a31, f ree (x) from unity\nis a measure of tree-level discretization errors. After the correction of eq. (13), we expect\nthese errors to be reduced from O(a2 ) to O(\u03b1s a2 ).\nConcerning \u03a32 (x) one observes that, in the continuum and in the chiral limit, the\nform factor vanishes at any order of perturbation theory. Therefore, in the case of \u03a32 we\nimplement the following correction:\n\n\u03a3corr\n(x) = \u03a32 (x) \u2212 \u03a3lat\n2\n2, f ree (x),\n\n(14)\n\nwhere \u03a3lat\n2, f ree represents a pure discretization effect. After eqs. (13) and (14) have been\nimplemented, we also average the results for the form factors \u03a31 (x) and \u03a32 (x) obtained\nat lattice points which correspond to the same value of x2 .\nThe remarkable effect of the correction on the two form factors is shown in fig. 1\n(bottom). In the following analysis, otherwise indicated, we will always use the corrected\nform factors defined in eqs. (13) and (14).\n\n5\n\n\fFigure 1: The bare form factors \u03a31 (left panels) and \u03a32 (right panels). We show, from\ntop to bottom: the form factors in the interacting theory, as obtained from the lattice\nsimulation at k=0.1349; the form factors computed in the free lattice theory, at infinite\nvolume and in the chiral limit; the \"corrected\" form factors defined in eqs. (13) and (14).\n\n6\n\n\f4\n\nRenormalization of the quark propagator in the Xscheme\n\nIn this section, we define the X-space renormalization scheme [15] for the quark propagator\nand discuss the determination of the corresponding renormalization constant.\nThe quark field renormalization constant Z\u03c8X (\u03bc), in the Landau gauge X-scheme, is\ndetermined non-perturbatively by imposing the condition\nZ\u03c8X (\u03bc = 1/x) \u03a31 (x)\n\n\u03be=0\nm\u21920\n\n= \u03a3cont\n1, f ree (x)\n\n(15)\n\nwhere the value of the form factor in the free continuum theory and in the chiral limit\n2\nis \u03a3cont\n1, f ree (x) = 1/(2\u03c0 ). The limit m \u2192 0 in eq. (15) guarantees a mass-independent\ndefinition of the renormalization scheme. It also guarantees that, when using the O(a)improved Wilson action, the renormalization constant computed from eq. (15) is automatically O(a)-improved, without need of further improving the quark field [17].3\nIn order to extrapolate the form factor \u03a31 (x) to the chiral limit we have assumed a\nlinear dependence on the quark mass. This dependence describes well the lattice data as\ncan be seen from fig. 2, where the linear fit is shown for three values of x2 in the range\nof interest. A quadratic fit has been also performed in order to evaluate the systematic\nerror involved in the chiral extrapolation.\nBy combining the renormalization condition (15) with the NLO evolution function of\nZ\u03c8 given in eq. (10) and considering that the LO anomalous dimension of the quark field\nvanishes in the Landau gauge, one finds at the NLO\nZ\u03c8X (\u03bc)\n\n=\n\nW\u03c8 (\u03bc, 1/x) Z\u03c8X (1/x)\n\n\u03b3\u03c81 \u03b1s (\u03bc) \u2212 \u03b1s (1/x)\n= 1\u2212\n2\u03b20\n4\u03c0\n\n!\n\n\u03a3cont\n1, f ree (x)\n\u03a31 (x)\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(16)\n\nWe also note that, in the Landau gauge, the equality of the renormalized form factor \u03a31 (x)\nat one loop in the MS and X schemes implies that the NLO anomalous dimensions \u03b3\u03c81 are\nalso equal in the two schemes. In the numerical analysis, \u03b1s (1/x) has been evaluated at the\nnf =0\n= 0.225(21) GeV\nNLO in the MS scheme by using nf = 0 and the quenched estimate \u039bQCD\nnf =0\n(obtained from r0 \u039bQCD = 0.602(48) [21] and using r0 = 0.525(25) fm).\nAs already discussed in the introduction, the X-space non-perturbative renormalization approach relies on the existence of a window a <\n\u223cx<\n\u223c 1/\u039bQCD which permits matching\nthe lattice results with the perturbative ones and, at the same time, to avoid the region at\nvery short distances affected by contact terms and large discretization effects. In practice,\n2\nin the present study, we consider this condition satisfied in the range 9 <\n\u223c (x/a) <\n\u223c 25\n\u22121\n(the upper bound corresponds to x \u223c 1 GeV).\n3\n\nIn the definition of the O(a)-improved quark field,\nqI (x) = q(x) + a bq m q(x) + a cq\u2032 (D\n/ + m) q(x) + a cN GI \u2202/ q(x)\n\nthe second term vanishes in the chiral limit, while the third one produces in the quark propagator a\ncontact term in x = 0. The contribution to the quark propagator of the last non gauge-invariant term\nhas been found to be practically indistinguishable from the contact term proportional to cq\u2032 [14].\n\n7\n\n\f0.059\n\n0.058\n\n0.057\n\n\u03a31(x=15)\n\u03a31(x=20)\n\u03a31(x=25)\nlinear fit\n\n0.056\n\n0.055\n\n0.054\n\n0.053\n0.010\n\n0.015\n\n0.020\n\n0.025\n\nam\n\n0.030\n\n0.035\n\n0.040\n\nAWI\n\nFigure 2: Quark mass dependence of \u03a31 (x) at three different values of x2 .

The quoted errors are statistical only.\nThe results for Z\u03c8X (\u03bc = 2 GeV) as obtained from eq. (16) at different values of x2 are\nshown in fig. 3. One observes that even in the region (x/a)2 = [9, 25] the data show some\nspread, at the level of few percent. This spread is due to discretization errors which remain\nafter the free theory correction has been implemented. It represents the main source of\nsystematic uncertainty in the evaluation of Z\u03c8 . A second source of uncertainty is due\nthe fact that one cannot exclude, even in the fitting region (x/a)2 = [9, 25], a systematic\ndependence of the data on x2 , which could be due to higher order contributions to the\nOPE of \u03a31 (x) neglected in eq. (6). In order to evaluate this systematics, we have evaluated\nZ\u03c8 (\u03bc) from both a constant and linear fit in (x/a)2 , by considering in the latter case larger\nintervals in x2 (up to (x/a)2 = 40). The results of the fits are presented in table 2.\nThe other sources of systematic effects, as those deriving from the determination of\nthe lattice scale, the estimate of \u039bQCD , the difference between linear and quadratic chiral\nextrapolations and the use of the vector or the axial-vector definitions of the quark masses\nin these extrapolations, are found to be negligible. As final estimate of Z\u03c8X (\u03bc) we thus\nquote\nZ\u03c8X (2 GeV) = 0.871 \u00b1 0.003 \u00b1 0.020\n(17)\nwhere the first error is statistical and the second systematic.

The dashed vertical lines show the range in (x/a)2\nwhere the constant fit is performed. The result of a linear fit in x2 is also shown (dashed\nline). In the latter case, the estimate of Z\u03c8X (\u03bc = 2 GeV) is given by the intercept.\nis the one obtained from the constant fit in the shorter distance range (x/a)2 = [9, 25],\nwhere the contribution of higher power corrections is more suppressed. The few percent\nerror on the value of Z\u03c8 introduces an uncertainty in the estimate of the chiral quark\ncondensate discussed in the next section which is completely negligible.\nThe vanishing of the one-loop contribution to the form factor \u03a31 (x) in the Landau\ngauge implies that the quark field renormalization constant at the NLO is equal in several\ncommonly used renormalization schemes. In particular,\nZ\u03c8X (\u03bc) = Z\u03c8MS (\u03bc) = Z\u03c8RI\u2212MOM (\u03bc)\n\n(18)\n\nat the NLO. The result in eq. (17) can be therefore directly compared to the value\nZ\u03c8RI\u2212MOM (2 GeV) = 0.865 \u00b1 0.003 obtained non-perturbatively in ref. [17] by using the\nRI-MOM method. It can be also compared with the prediction of one-loop boosted perturbation theory Z\u03c8MS (2 GeV) \u2243 0.880.\nWe also quote the value of Z\u03c8X obtained by using the rough lattice data, without\nimplementing the tree-level correction of discretization effects: Z\u03c8X (2 GeV) = 0.868 \u00b1\n0.003 \u00b1 0.080. The difference in the central value with respect to eq. (17) is less than\n0.5%. As expected, however, the systematic uncertainty is much larger in the latter case,\ndue to the significantly larger spread of the points in the fitting region. In practice, the\ntree-level correction has smoothed the overall behavior of the quark propagator at short\n9\n\n\fdistances allowing the reduction of the systematic uncertainty by about a factor 4, but\naffecting the central value by only a small amount.\n\n5\n\nExtraction of the quark condensate\n\nOne of the advantages of the approach considered in this paper to evaluate the chiral quark\ncondensate is that the renormalization procedure is greatly simplified: in the OPE of the\nquark propagator, expressed by eq. (1), once the propagator on the l.h.s. is renormalized\nby the quark field renormalization constant, the r.h.s. turns out to be expressed directly\nin terms of renormalized quantities. In particular, the quark condensate, renormalized at\na scale \u03bc, can be extracted directly from the trace of the quark propagator (i.e. the scalar\nform factor \u03a32 ) renormalized at the same scale. Furthermore, once the quark propagator\nis improved at O(a), the operator matrix elements which enter its OPE are automatically\nimproved at the same order.\nIn the study of the OPE, the physical quantity which we are interested in is the quark\ncondensate in the chiral limit. To reach this limit, we have followed two procedures. In\nthe first approach, we extrapolate to the chiral limit the scalar form factor \u03a32 (x) for\neach value of x2 . The quark condensate is then evaluated by using the OPE expressed\nby eq. (9), which is accurate at the NLO, in the massless case. In this limit, the quark\ncondensate represents the leading term of the expansion. In the second approach, which\nwe consider for a consistency check of the calculation, the order of the extrapolations is\ninverted. At finite values of the quark mass, the OPE of \u03a32 at order x2 contains, besides\nthe quark condensate, a term proportional to m3 . In this case, we first extract the whole\nO(x2 ) contribution to the OPE and then extrapolate the result to the chiral limit. As\nwe will show in the following, the two procedures yield completely consistent predictions.\nWe now discuss the two approaches in more detail.\nMethod I: For each value of x2 , the renormalized form factor \u03a32 (x) is extrapolated to\nthe chiral limit, both linearly and quadratically in either the vector or the axial-vector\nquark masses. Examples of this chiral extrapolation, for three typical values of x2 , are\nshown in fig. 4. For each value of x2 we have then computed the quantity\nQI (x, \u03bc) \u2261 \u2212\n\nchiral\n(\u03a3MS\n2 (x, \u03bc))\n= h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8iMS (\u03bc) + O(x2 )\nC\u03c8\u0304\u03c8 (x, \u03bc) x2 /4Nc\n\n(19)\n\nand performed a fit to the form\nQI (x, \u03bc) = h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8iMS (\u03bc) + B x2 .\n\n(20)\n\nBoth constant (B = 0) and linear fits have been performed, and the results are presented\nin table 3, see also fig. 5. Since the results of the linear fit are unstable when the fit is\nlimited to the interval (x/a)2 = [9, 25], we have considered in this case larger distances,\nup to (x/a)2 = 40. In all cases, we find consistent results for the quark condensate, as can\nbe seen from table 3. We also find that the contribution of the O(x2 ) term is completely\nnegligible, and the coefficient B is compatible with zero within the statistical errors.\n10\n\n\fMethod I - Chiral Fit\n0.0012\n\n0.0010\n\n\u03a32(x=15)\n\u03a32(x=20)\n\u03a32(x=25)\nlinear fits\n\n0.0008\n\n0.0006\n\n0.015\n\n0.020\n\n0.025\n\nam\n\n0.030\n\nAWI\n\nFigure 4: Quark mass dependence of \u03a32 (x) at three different values of x2 .

(20).\nAs a further check of our results, we have also extracted the quark condensate directly\nfrom the ratio \u03a32 /\u03a31 of the two form factors. From eq. (6) one finds that, in the chiral\nlimit, this ratio behaves as\n\u03a32 (x)\n\u03c0 2 C\u03c8\u0304\u03c8 (x, \u03bc)\n\u03a3X\n2 (x, \u03bc)\n=\n=\n\u2212\nh\u03c8\u0304\u03c8iMS(\u03bc) + O(x2 ) .\n\u03a3X\n(x,\n\u03bc)\n\u03a3\n(x)\n2N\nC\n(x,\n\u03bc)\n1\nc\nI\n1\n\n(21)\n\nThe determination of the quark condensate from eq. (21) bypasses the evaluation of the\nquark field renormalization constant Z\u03c8 . This constant cancels in the ratio, since it enters\nthe renormalization of both the form factors \u03a31 and \u03a32 . This also implies that the r.h.s.\nof eq. (21) is independent of the choice of the renormalization scale \u03bc. We also find\nthat this ratio, when computed by using the non-corrected form factors, exhibits a more\nstable plateau as a function of x2 . The results for the quark condensate obtained with\nthe two approaches are in excellent agreement (within less than 2%), indicating that the\nuncertainty connected with the evaluation of Z\u03c8 is actually negligible.\nMethod II: In this second approach we study the OPE of \u03a32 (x) at finite values of the\nquark mass, extract the O(x2 ) contribution to the expansion and extrapolate it to the\nchiral limit, in order to get the chiral quark condensate.\nThe fit of the form factor \u03a32 to its OPE is shown in fig. 6, for two values of the quark\nmass. We find that the mass term contribution to the OPE, which is leading at very\nshort distances where lattice artifacts are more severe, is poorly estimated from the fit.\nFor this reason, we have chosen to fix the renormalized quark mass in eq. (9) to the values\ndetermined in ref. [19] and collected in table 1. Therefore, for each value of the quark\nmass we compute the quantity\nQII (x, m, \u03bc) \u2261 \u2212\n\nMS\n\u03a3MS\n(\u03bc)/4\u03c0 2\n2 (x, \u03bc) \u2212 Cm (x, \u03bc) m\n.\nC\u03c8\u0304\u03c8 (x, \u03bc) x2 /4Nc\n\n(22)\n\nNotice that, in the chiral limit, QII (x, m, \u03bc) reduces to QI (x, \u03bc) defined in eq. (19). The\nsmall spread of the results coming from choosing the vector or the axial-vector quark\nmasses is included in the systematics. We then fit QII (x, m, \u03bc) either to a constant or\nlinearly in x2 and extrapolate the result, denoted as QII (m, \u03bc) in fig. 7, to the chiral limit,\nwhere it reduces to the chiral quark condensate. The quark mass extrapolation is shown\nin fig. 7. Though the points in the plot look very well aligned, a quadratic fit in the\nquark mass has been also performed, in order to evaluate the corresponding systematic\nuncertainty. We find that the results obtained for the chiral quark condensate with this\n12\n\n\f2\n\nMethod II - x Fit\n0.0020\n\n0.0015\n\n0.0010\n\n0.0005\n\n0.0000\n\n\u03a32(x, \u03bc = 2 GeV) \u03ba=0.1349\n\u03a32(x, \u03bc = 2 GeV) \u03ba=0.1353\n5\n\n0\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n(x/a)\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n2\n\n2\nFigure 6: Values of \u03a3X\n2 (x, \u03bc = 2 GeV) as a function of (x/a) for two different values\nof the quark mass.

We quote:\nh\u03c8\u0304\u03c8iMS (2GeV) = \u2212(265 \u00b1 5 \u00b1 22 MeV)3 ,\n\n(23)\n\nwhere the first error is statistical and the second systematic. The latter, which amounts\nto about 25%, is due to:\n- the spread of the points in the fitting regions. As discussed in sect.3, this spread is\nmostly due to discretization effects which are left after the tree-level O(a)-correction\nhas been applied to the lattice data. This error, of about 18%, represents the main\nsource of systematic uncertainty, besides the quenching approximation.\n- Arbitrariness in the choice of the fitting interval (within the window a <\n\u223c x <\n\u223c\n1/\u039bQCD ). This yields a 4-5% uncertainty.\n- Different functional forms considered in the fits. Performing a quadratic fit instead\nof a linear one in the quark mass extrapolations introduces a systematic difference\nof about 9%. Including the O(x2 ) contribution in the fits of QI and QII to their\nOPEs gives a 4-5% variation in the results.\n- The statistical error associated to the determination of the lattice spacing. This error\nintroduces an uncertainty of about 15% in the estimate of the quark condensate.\nNotice that the systematic error associated in the quenched approximation to the\ndependence of the lattice spacing on the physical quantity used to fix the scale is\nnot included. We consider this error as a part of the systematic quenching effect.\n- The uncertainty on the quark field renormalization constant Z\u03c8 , used to renormalize\nthe quark propagator. This effect is completely negligible in the determination of\nthe quark condensate, as discussed in sect.5.\n- The difference between the results obtained using either the vector or the axialvector definitions of the quark masses. The systematics is slightly affected by this\neffect, by less than 1%.\n- The 10% error on the quenched estimate of \u039bQCD gives a completely negligible\nuncertainty in the determination of the quark condensate.\nThe uncertainty coming from finite volume effects cannot be directly estimated in the\npresent study, since our results have been obtained at fixed volume. A study of lattice\nartifacts performed in ref. [15] has shown that in the short distance region, which is the one\nrelevant for the X-space method, finite volume effects on the lattice correlation functions\n14\n\n\fin the free theory are negligible with respect to discretization effects. We expect this result\nto remain valid in the interacting theory as well, though a more quantitative conclusion on\nthis point would require further investigations. The main source of uncertainty which is\nnot evaluated in our estimate of the chiral quark condensate is the effect of the quenching\napproximation.\nIn conclusion, in this exploratory study we have investigated on the lattice the OPE\nof the quark propagator at short euclidean distances, and shown the feasibility of this approach to compute the chiral quark condensate. The result obtained in this way is in good\nagreement with previous determinations of this quantity based on different approaches.\nThe strategy investigated in the present study can be also applied to compute on the\nlattice the matrix elements of other local operators which enter the OPE of correlation\nfunctions at the leading orders. It can be also directly implemented in lattice simulations\nperformed with dynamical quarks.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank D. Becirevic, L. Giusti, G. Martinelli and M.

(6).\nThe OPE of the quark propagator in euclidean space is expressed by\n(/\nx)\n1\nm\n1\nCI (x) 2 2 + 2 Cm (x) 2\n2\n2\u03c0\n(x )\n4\u03c0\nx\n1\n\u2212\nC (x) (\u03c8\u0304\u03c8) + . . .\n4N \u03c8\u0304\u03c8\n\nT (\u03c8(x)\u03c8\u0304(0)) =\n\n(24)\n\nwhere the dots represent higher powers of x2 and of the quark mass m. All quantities in\neq. (24) are renormalized at a given scale and in a given renormalization scheme. In the\nfollowing, we will choose the MS renormalization scheme.\nIn order to determine the Wilson coefficients at the NLO in QCD, we calculate both the\nleft and the right hand side of eq. (24) up to O(\u03b1s ) by choosing a common set of external\nstates. The coefficients CI (x) and Cm (x), in particular, can be determined by taking the\nvacuum expectation value of eq. (24) in perturbation theory, where the contribution of\nthe quark condensate is vanishing. Eq. (24) then simply reduces to\nS(x) =\n\n1\n(/\nx)\n1\nm\nCI (x) 2 2 + 2 Cm (x) 2 ,\n2\n2\u03c0\n(x )\n4\u03c0\nx\n\n15\n\n(25)\n\n\fwhere S(x) is the quark propagator computed in one-loop perturbation theory.
