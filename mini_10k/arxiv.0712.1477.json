Introduction. Random walks have been studied in abstract settings such as\ninteger lattices Zd or Riemannian manifolds ([4], [7], [10]). In applied settings there\nare many spatially explicit individual-based models (IBMs) in which the behavior of\nthe system is determined by the meeting of randomly moving agents. The transmission of a pathogenic agent, the spread of a rumor, or the sharing of some property\nwhen randomly moving particles meet are examples that come to mind in biology,\nsociology, or physics ([3], [8], [6], [5], [2]). In many of these models the movement of\nagents is conceptualized as discrete transitions between square or hexagonal cells ([3]).\nHowever, such a stylized representation of individual movements may not always be\nentirely realistic.\nAlthough IBMs are powerful tools for the description of complex systems, they\nsuffer from a shortage of analytical results. For example, if a susceptible and an\ninfective agent move randomly in some bounded space, what is the probability of\nthem meeting, and hence of the transmission of the infection? What is the average\ntime until the meeting takes place?\nIn the present paper we begin to answer these questions by considering a random\nwalk in a bounded region of the plane or on the sphere, which we denote by R. The\nmodel evolves in discrete time. At each time-step an agent leaves its current position\nat a uniformly distributed angle in the (0, 2\u03c0) interval. On the plane the agent moves\na fixed distance d in a straight line. On a sphere the agent moves a fixed distance d\non a geodesic.\nHere we will consider two such agents who move different distances d1 and d2 at\neach time-step. We assume that the agents' initial positions are uniformly distributed\nin R. The paper's central results concern the probability that the paths of the two\nagents cross during the first time-step. If R is either a sufficiently large bounded\nregion of the plane or a sphere, this \"first-step\" probability of intersection is close to\n2d1 d2 /(\u03c0A[R]) where A[R] is the area of R.\nIn applied settings we are often interested in the long-run average rate at which the\npaths cross. In order to extend results on the \"first-step\" probability of intersection\nand apply the law of large numbers we would need the following assumptions:\n\u2022 The positions of the two agents are uniformly distributed at every time step\n(which is the case on the sphere but not on the plane because of reflection\nproblems at the boundary of R),\n\u2022 The crossing-path events are independent over time (which is the case in\nneither setting because of the strong spatial dependence at consecutive timesteps).\n1\n\n\fFig. 1.1. Example of two trajectories V1 (k) and V2 (k) with paths that crossed synchronously\nat m1 for k = 2. (We are not interested in the asynchronous crossing at m2 which took place at\ndifferent times for the two agents).\n\nNumerous simulations have shown that despite marked departures from these\nassumptions the long-run rate at which the paths cross is also close to 2d1 d2 /(\u03c0A[R]).\nSection 2 contains the results both for the plane and the sphere. Section 3 is\ndevoted to the numerical simulations. Extensions are discussed in Section 4. Three\ntechnical appendices can be found in Section 5.\n2. Model.\n2.1. Geometric description in the plane and on the sphere. A bounded\nregion of the plane is the most natural setting for agents moving in a 2D environment.\nHowever we then need to specify how agents are reflected when they hit the boundary\nof the region. There is no such problem on a sphere. In what follows R is either a\nbounded region of the plane or a sphere.\nThe initial positions V1 (0) and V2 (0) of the two agents are assumed uniformly\ndistributed in R. At each time-step the two agents move distances d1 and d2 (which\nare fixed positive parameters) in a straight line (or along a geodesic on a sphere). They\ndepart at random angles \u03b11 and \u03b12 that are uniformly and independently distributed\nover (0, 2\u03c0). The endpoints after the k \u2212 th time-step are V1 (k) and V2 (k) (Figure\n1.1).\nThe definition of a meeting in such a model is tricky because the probability of\nthe two agents being in exactly the same position at any given period is 0. There are\nhowever different ways of approximating such a meeting.\nOne could say that the agents meet if the distance between two points V1 (k) and\nV2 (k) is less than some \u01eb. In such a definition results would depend on \u01eb, which is\nundesirable. For this reason we choose to define a meeting during the k \u2212 th timestep when paths cross between k and k + 1. This means that the segments (or the\n\"geodesic arcs\") V1 (k)V1 (k + 1) and V2 (k)V2 (k + 1) intersect. We recognize that V1 (k)\nand V2 (k) can then be close without the paths crossing, but at least the definition\ndoes not depend on some arbitrary \u01eb.\nThe point m1 in Figure 1.1 is an example of such a synchronous crossing of paths.\nOf course the agents are not at m1 at the same time. In the figure the paths cross\n2\n\n\fasynchronously at m2 .\nMuch will depend on whether V1 (k) and V2 (k) are uniformly distributed on R for\nevery k. This will be the case if R is a sphere because V1 (0) and V2 (0) are themselves\nuniformly distributed. If on the other hand R is a bounded region of the plane, then\nthe uniformity in the distributions of V1 (k) and V2 (k) is compromised for k > 0 by\nthe vexing problem of the behavior of the agents when they hit the boundary of R.\nFor this reason we focus on the probability of paths crossing at the first time-step\ndef.\ndef.\nonly. We simplify notations by letting V1 = (x1 , y1 ) and V2 = (x2 , y2 ) be the initial\npositions of the two agents. The corresponding endpoints are denoted W1 and W2 .\nWe next proceed with calculations when R is a bounded region of the plane.\n2.2. Crossing-path probability in a bounded region of the plane. In the\nplane the endpoints W1 and W2 are\ndef.\n\nW1 = V1 + d1 (cos(\u03b11 ), sin(\u03b11 ))\ndef.\n\nW2 = V2 + d2 (cos(\u03b12 ), sin(\u03b12 ))\n\n(2.1)\n(2.2)\n\nwhere \u03b11 and \u03b12 are polar angles that are uniformly distributed in (0, 2\u03c0).\nWe will finesse the reflection problem at the boundary of R by considering the\npossibility of intersection on the basis of Eqs. (2.1) - (2.2) even if W1 or W2 is outside\nR. In such a case we examine first whether the intersection has occurred. We then\nmove, in some unspecified manner, the wayward point(s) back inside R.\nWe now define the feasible domain F D(V1 , \u03b11 ) as the set of points V that are\nwithin d2 of the segment V1 W1 :\ndef.\n\nF D(V1 , \u03b11 ) = {V = (x, y) such that d(V, (V1 W1 )) \u2264 d2 }\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere d(V, (V1 W1 )) is the distance between a point V and the segment V1 W1 .\nThe point V2 must be in F D(V1 , \u03b11 ) in order for the segments V1 W1 and V2 W2\nto intersect - although the condition is not sufficient. Figure 2.1 depicts a segment\nV1 W1 and the corresponding feasible domain F D(V1 , \u03b11 ). This domain is bounded\nby dotted lines (a rectangle with sides d1 and 2d2 with a half circle of radius d2 at\neach end of the rectangle). In the figure a point V2 is in the feasible domain and the\ntwo segments V1 W1 and V2 W2 intersect. Whether there is an intersection depends on\nthe angle \u03b12 .\nThe region R is partitioned into an inner region Ri and a border region Rb characterized by a distance to the outside world that is either larger (for Ri ) or smaller\n(for Rb ) than d1 + d2 . (The point is that F D(V1 , \u03b11 ) is entirely in R if V1 \u2208 Ri ). We\ndefineA[S] as the area of a bounded subset S of R2 .\nWith V1 = (x1 , y1 ) and V2 = (x2 , y2 ) uniformly and independently distributed on\nR, we will now calculate the probability that V1 W1 and V2 W2 intersect. This first-step\nprobability of intersection depends only on d1 , d2 and R, and is noted Pp (d1 , d2 , R).\n(The subscript p indicates a probability in the plane).\nWe first need the probability Gp (x1 , y1 , \u03b11 ) of the intersection conditionally on\nV1 = (x1 , y1 ) and \u03b11 ; GpT\n(x1 , y1 , \u03b11 ) is the probability (denoted by p1 below) that V2\nfalls in F D((x1 , y1 ), \u03b11 ) R multiplied by the probability (denoted by T\np2 below) of\nthe segments intersecting conditionally on V2 falling in F D((x1 , y1 ), \u03b11 ) R. (In the\nF D function we have replaced V1 by its coordinates (x1 , y1 )).\n3\n\n\fFig. 2.1. Example of two intersecting segments V1 W1 and V2 W2 with feasible domain\nF D(V1 , \u03b11 ). Inner and border regions Ri and Rb are at distances to the outside world that are\nlarger than and less than the sum d1 + d2 . (The distance d1 + d2 between the two boundaries is not\nto scale).\n\nGiven the uniformity assumption on V2 , the probability p1 is then\nA[F D((x1 , y1 ), \u03b11 )\np1 =\nA[R]\n\nT\n\nR]\n\n.\n\n(2.4)\n\nIn order to calculate p2 we need to define the probability fp (x1 , y1 , \u03b11 , x2 , y2 ) that\nV2 W2 intersects V1 W1 , conditionally on V1 = (x1 , y1 ), V2 = (x2 , y2 ) and the angle \u03b11 .\n(This probability, derived in Appendix A, is obtained by calculating the magnitude of\nthe angle \u03b2 within which \u03b12 must fall for the intersection to occur, and then dividing\nby 2\u03c0). The conditional probability p2 of the intersection is then\n\np2 =\n\nRR\n\nfp (x1 , y1 , \u03b11 , x2 , y2 )dx2 dy2\nT\n.\nA[F D((x1 , y1 ), \u03b11 ) R]\n\n(x2 ,y2 )\u2208F D((x1 ,y1 ),\u03b11 )\n\nT\n\nR\n\n(2.5)\n\nThe probability Gp (x1 , y1 , \u03b11 ) is now the product p1 p2 which simplifies to\nRR\nT f (x , y , \u03b11 , x2 , y2 )dx2 dy2\n(x2 ,y2 )\u2208F D((x1 ,y1 ),\u03b11 ) R p 1 1\nGp (x1 , y1 , \u03b11 ) =\n.\n(2.6)\nA[R]\n4\n\n\fWhen V1 = (x1 , y1 ) is in Ri (i.e. the feasible domain is entirely in R) then the\ndouble integral on the right-hand side of Eq. (2.6) is independent of V1 and is noted\nIp (d1 , d2 ), i.e.\ndef.\n\nIp (d1 , d2 ) =\n\nZZ\n\nfp (x1 , y1 , \u03b11 , x2 , y2 )dx2 dy2 .\n\n(2.7)\n\n(x2 ,y2 )\u2208F D((x1 ,y1 ),\u03b11 )\n\nThe quantity Ip (d1 , d2 ) is an upper bound for the double integral in Eq. (2.6) when\nV1 = (x1 , y1 ) is in the border region Rb (because the integration is then over an area\nsmaller than the feasible domain F D(x1 , y1 )).\nWe now have the following result on Ip (d1 , d2 ), Gp (x1 , y1 , \u03b11 ), and Pp (d1 , d2 , R).\nProposition 2.1. We have\nIp (d1 , d2 ) = 2d1 d2 /\u03c0\n\n(2.8)\n\nand when V1 = (x1 , y1 ) is in Ri ,\nGp (x1 , y1 , \u03b11 ) =\n\n2d1 d2\n.\n\u03c0A[R]\n\n(2.9)\n\n2d1 d2\n.\n\u03c0A[R]\n\n(2.10)\n\nWhen V1 = (x1 , y1 ) is in Rb then\nGp (x1 , y1 , \u03b11 ) \u2264\n\nThe first-step probability of intersection Pp (d1 , d2 , R) satisfies\ndef.\n\nplo =\n\n2d1 d2 A[Ri ]\ndef. 2d1 d2\n\u2264 Pp (d1 , d2 , R) \u2264 phi =\n\u03c0A[R]2\n\u03c0A[R]\n\n(2.11)\n\nwhich leads to the mid-point approximation\ndef.\n\nPp (d1 , d2 , R) \u2245 p\u2217 = d1 d2\n\nA[Ri ] + A[R]\n.\n\u03c0A[R]2\n\n(2.12)\n\nThe absolute value of the maximum percentage error (AVMPE) made with the\napproximation of (2.12) is\nAV M P E = 100\n\nA[R] \u2212 A[Ri ]\n.\nA[R] + A[Ri ]\n\n(2.13)\n\nProof. See Appendix A.\nRemark. The approximation of Eq. (2.12) is of interest and the error of Eq. (2.13)\nis small only if A[R] is large enough in the sense that A[Ri ] is relatively close to A[R].\nThis means there is a large subset of R within which the feasible domain F D(V1 , \u03b11 )\nis entirely in R. Suppose for example that R is a circle of radius r > d1 + d2 , then\n\u00012\n2\n1 \u2212 1 \u2212 d1 +d\nr\n(2.14)\nAV M P E = 100\n\u00012\n2\n1 + 1 \u2212 d1 +d\nr\nwhich is approximately 100(d1 + d2 )/r when d1 + d2 is much smaller than r. Therefore\nif d1 + d2 is one percent of the radius then the maximum error made with the estimate\nof Eq. (2.12) is also approximately one percent.\nWe next turn our attention to the situation in which R is a sphere.\n5\n\n\f2.3. Crossing-path probability on a sphere. When the domain R is a sphere\nof radius \u03c1 we use the spherical system of coordinates where a point V is defined by\nthe triplet (\u03c1, \u03b8, \u03c6) of radial, azimuthal, and zenithal coordinates.\ndef.\n\nGiven initial points Vk = (\u03c1, \u03b8k , \u03c6k ), (k = 1, 2) each endpoint Wk is on the circle\nat a geodesic distance dk from Vk . The position of Wk on the circle is determined by\nan angle \u03b1k uniformly distributed in (0, 2\u03c0). See Appendix B for the exact derivation\nof the endpoints Wk .\nWe let Ps (d1 , d2 , R) be the probability that the arcs V1 W1 and V2 W2 intersect.\nBecause the initial points Vk are uniformly distributed, the endpoints will also be\nuniformly distributed on the sphere. Therefore Ps (d1 , d2 , R) is the probability of\npaths crossing at every time-step.\nIn order to calculate Ps (d1 , d2 , R) we proceed as before except that there is no\nborder area and the double integrals are calculated in spherical coordinates. The\nfeasible domain is denoted F D(\u03b81 , \u03c61 ) and is defined with geodesic distances. The\ndifferential area element is now \u03c12 sin(\u03c6)d\u03b8d\u03c6.\nWe let fs (\u03b81 , \u03c61 , \u03b11 , \u03b82 , \u03c62 ) be the probability of intersection conditionally on the\narc V1 W1 (defined by \u03b81 , \u03c61 and \u03b11 ) and on V2 (defined by \u03b82 and \u03c62 ). We also define\nthe double integral\n\ndef.\n\nIs (d1 , d2 , \u03c1) =\n\nZZ\n\nfs (\u03b81 , \u03c61 , \u03b11 , \u03b82 , \u03c62 )\u03c12 sin(\u03c62 )d\u03b82 d\u03c62 .

We then have\nGs (d1 , d2 , \u03c1) =\n\nIs (d1 , d2 , \u03c1)\nA[R]\n\n(2.16)\n\nwhere the area A[R] of the sphere appearing in the denominator is now 4\u03c0\u03c12 .\nThe probability of paths crossing at each time-step is then\nPs (d1 , d2 , R) =\n\nRRR\n\n(\u03b81 ,\u03c61 )\u2208R,\u03b11 \u2208(0,2\u03c0)\n\nGs (\u03b81 , \u03c61 , \u03b11 )\u03c12 sin(\u03c61 )d\u03b81 d\u03c61 d\u03b11\n2\u03c0A[R]\n\n=\n\nIs (d1 , d2 , \u03c1)\nIs (d1 , d2 , \u03c1)\n.\n=\nA[R]\n4\u03c0\u03c12\n\n(2.17)\n\nWhen \u03c1 \u2192 \u221e the integral Is (d1 , d2 , \u03c1) on the sphere approaches the corresponding\nintegral Ip (d1 , d2 ) = 2d1 d2 /\u03c0 on the plane (Eq. (2.8)).\nIn the next proposition we show numerically that Is (d1 , d2 , \u03c1) is extremely close\nto 2d1 d2 /\u03c0 even when \u03c1 is not particularly large compared to d1 and d2 . We will just\nassume that\n\u03c0 d1\nd2\nd2\n< ,\n+\n<\u03c0\n\u03c1\n2 2\u03c1\n\u03c1\nwhich insures that the feasible domain does not \"wrap around\" the sphere.\n6\n\n(2.18)\n\n\fProposition 2.2.

See Appendix C.\nThe next section is devoted to simulations aimed at assessing the quality of the\napproximations derived above.\n3. Simulations. We consider a region R that is a circle of radius r = 10. At\neach time-step the two agents move distances d1 = 1 and d2 = 0.7 respectively. If an\nagent moves outside the circle we first check whether paths have crossed. We then\nmove the wayward agent to a point diametrically opposed to its current position, at\na distance inside the circle equal to the distance between the circle and the current\nposition. This algorithm could be considered a 2D version of the wrapping around\nthat takes place on a sphere. The goal is to try to keep the distribution of the agents as\nuniform as possible. We need this in order for the crossing-path probability to remain\nas close as possible to the \"first-step\" probability derived under the assumption that\ninitial positions are uniformly distributed.\nThe bounds of (2.11) and the approximation of (2.12) are now used to calculate\nthe low, high and mid-point approximations plo , phi , p\u2217 for the first-step probability\nof intersection Ps (d1 , d2 , \u03c1):\nplo =\n\n2d1 d2\n2d1 d2 A[Ri ]\n= 0.0009772, phi =\n= 0.001418,\n\u03c0A[R]2\n\u03c0A[R]\n\np\u2217 = d1 d2\n\nA[Ri ] + A[Rb ]\n= 0.001198\n\u03c0A[R]2\n\n(3.1)\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhich translate into a maximum error AV M P E on p\u2217 of 18.42% (Eq. (2.14)). This\nerror is relatively large because the sum d1 + d2 is 1.7, which is not particularly small\ncompared to the radius 10 of the circle.\nWe let F (k) be the random variable equal to the average crossing path frequency\nover the first k time-steps. If the probability of paths crossing at every time-step\nwere plo (or phi ) and if paths crossing were independent events (which they are not)\nthen the Central Limit Theorem would insure that for large k the corresponding\n\"hypothetical frequency\" Fh (k) would bep\napproximately normally\np distributed with\nmean plo (or phi ) and standard deviation plo (1 \u2212 plo )/k (or phi (1 \u2212 phi )/k).\nFigure 3.1 depicts a simulated trajectory of the frequency F (k). We also plotted\nthe hypothetical low and high intervals within which each Fh (k) would fall with\nprobability 0.95. These bands shed light on the expected fluctuations of the frequency,\nin the case of independent events taking place with probability plo (or phi ).\nThis and other simulations suggest that p\u2217 gives at least an idea of the (long-run)\ncrossing-path probability.\n7\n\n\f\u22123\n\n3\n\nx 10\n\nphi + 1.96\n\np\n\nphi (1 \u2212 phi )/k\n\n2.5\n\nFrequency\n\n2\nplo + 1.96\n\np\nplo (1 \u2212 plo )/k\n\n1.5\np\u2217\n1\nphi \u2212 1.96\n\np\n\nphi (1 \u2212 phi )/k\n\n0.5\nplo \u2212 1.96\n0\n\n0\n\n5000\n\np\n\n10000\n\nplo (1 \u2212 plo )/k\n15000\n\nk\n\nFig. 3.1. Average crossing-path frequency F (k) (over the first k time-steps) for two random\nwalks in a circle of radius r = 10 with d1 = 1 and d2 = 0.7 (15,000 time-steps). At each time-step\nthe intervals within which the \"hypothetical frequency\" Fh (k) falls with probability 0.95 are given\nfor the low and high approximations plo and phi of P (d1 , d2 , \u03c1). The mid-point approximation p\u2217\nis also plotted.\n\nThere is less uncertainty on the sphere as we have shown that the one-step probability of intersection Ps (d1 , d2 , R) is extremely close to d1 d2 /(2\u03c0 2 \u03c12 ). Simulations\nperformed on the sphere (not shown) yield long-run crossing-path rates that are close\nto d1 d2 /(2\u03c0 2 \u03c12 ) even though the law of large numbers cannot be invoked because of\nspatial dependence over time.\n4. Discussion. The expression of Eq. (2.12) for the crossing-path probability\nin the plane can be relatively crude. However it has the merit of simplicity and it\nimproves if the area of the region R increases.\nOn the sphere the crossing-path probability can be approximated very closely by\nthe simple expression d1 d2 /(2\u03c0 2 \u03c12 ). We derived this expression on the basis of an\nanalytical result for the plane (Appendix A), expecting it to be a good approximation\nonly for a sphere of infinitely large radius. It is of some interest to note that because\nof the complexity of the multiple integrals in spherical coordinates we saw now way of\nobtaining this approximation from the calculations performed directly on the sphere\n(Appendix C).\nBecause of marked departures from required assumptions the law of large numbers\ncould be applied neither in the plane nor on the sphere. Despite that, the long-run\naverage crossing-path probabilities appear to be close to the first-step probabilities.\nThis suggests that a weaker version of the law of large numbers may be applicable.\nFor example results on \"weakly dependent\" random variables (i.e. variables that are\n\"m\" (or \"\u03c6\")-dependent ([9])) may provide more insights into the long-run behavior\nof the system.\nWe note some obvious and some less obvious extensions that can be of use to\npopulation biologists (and perhaps others):\n8\n\n\fFig. 5.1. Intersecting segments V1 W1 and V2 W2 in coordinate system in which V1 W1 lies on\nthe x-axis and the origin is at the middle of V1 W1 .\n\n\u2022 If the crossing of paths takes place between an infected and a susceptible\nagent, then the transmission of the infection may occur with only a probability\n\u03c4 . In such a case the crossing-path probabilities found here need simply be\nmultiplied by \u03c4 in order to obtain the probability of transmission at each\ntime-step.\n\u2022 An important extension would have I such infectives and S such susceptibles.\nEpidemiologists would be keenly interested in analytical results on the rate\nat which the infection would then spread.\n\u2022 The assumption that an agent moves at an angle that is uniformly distributed\nin (0,2\u03c0) may not be realistic. For example animals may move only within\na limited angle in the continuation of the previous direction. Preliminary\ninvestigations suggest that the results obtained here may still be applicable.\nThe results given in this paper are merely starting points for more in-depth theoretical investigations. They also provide practitioners with some answers concerning\nthe dynamics of a process that depends on randomly moving agents meeting in a\nspatially explicit environment.\n5. Appendices.\n5.1. Appendix A: Proof of Proposition 2.1. The double integral Ip (d1 , d2 )\nin Eq. (2.6) is calculated in the orthonormal coordinate system (x, y) for which the\nsegment V1 W1 lies on the x-axis and the origin is at the middle of the segment (Figure\n5.1).\nIn the new coordinate system, the probability fp (x1 , y1 , \u03b11 , x2 , y2 ) that V1 W1 and\nV2 W2 intersect depends only on the components (x2 , y2 ) of V2 . If this probability is\ndenoted Fp (x2 , y2 ), then Ip (d1 , d2 ) is\n\nIp (d1 , d2 ) =\n\nZ\n\ny=d2\n\ny=\u2212d2\n\nZ\n\nx=d1 /2+\n\n\u221a\n\nx=\u2212d1 /2\u2212\n\nd22 \u2212y 2\n\n\u221a\n\nFp (x, y)dxdy.\n\n(5.1)\n\nd22 \u2212y 2\n\nThe probability Fp (x2 , y2 ) is obtained by calculating the magnitude of the angle\n\u03b2 within which V2 W2 (defined by the angle \u03b12 ) must fall and then dividing by 2\u03c0 (see\n9\n\n\fFigure 5.1). In the Figure the point V2 is in neither circle and the angle \u03b2 is the vertex\nangle in the isosceles triangle with apex V2 and two sides of length d2 . Therefore,\nwhen V2 is in neither circle the probability Fp (x2 , y2 ) of an intersection is given by\nthe function\n\u0013\n\u0012\n|y2 |\n2 arccos\nd2\ndef.\n.\n(5.2)\nFp,1 (x2 , y2 ) =\n2\u03c0\nSimilar geometric considerations show that if the two circles overlap (i.e. d1 /2 < d2 )\nthen for a point (x2 , y2 ) in the intersection of the two circles, the probability of\nintersection F (x2 , y2 ) is given by the function\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nx2 + d1 /2\nx2 \u2212 d1 /2\narctan\n\u2212 arctan\n|y2 |\n|y2 |\ndef.\n.\n(5.3)\nFp,2 (x2 , y2 ) =\n2\u03c0\nFinally, if (x2 , y2 ) is in only one of the circles, then one of the vertices of the\ntriangle with apex V2 will be the center V1 or W1 of that circle.
