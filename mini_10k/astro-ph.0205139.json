INTRODUCTION\nThe ionizing spectral energy distribution (hereafter ISED) of nearby active galactic nuclei cannot\nbe observed directly, due to the galactic absorption\nbeyond the Lyman limit. Owing to the redshift effect, however, we can get a glimpse of the ISED\nfrom the spectra of very distant quasars. The pioneering work of Zheng et al. (1997, ZK97), using\nHST archived data, showed that the power-law index (F\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u03b1 ) steepens from \u2248 \u22121 for \u03bb > 1050 \u00c5\nto \u2248 \u22122 at shorter wavelengths (combining radioloud and radio-quiet quasars). Qualitatively similar\nresults were found by Telfer et al. 2002 (hereafter\nTZ02), using a larger sample.\nKorista, Ferland & Baldwin (1997) pointed out\nthat such a steep slope for the ionizing continuum\nwould imply an insufficient number of photons beyond h\u03bd > 54.4 eV to account for the observed luminosities of the high excitation emission lines.\nWe report preliminary results of a study aimed\nat finding an alternative explanation for the break,\none that is extrinsic to the quasar spectral energy\ndistribution. We postulate the existence of a very\n\ntenuous absorption gas component that pervades the\nuniverse, and proceed to study the characteristics it\nmust possess to reproduce the observed break.\n2. PROCEDURE\nThe composite spectrum of ZK97 was constructed by merging 284 spectra of 101 quasars,\ntaken with FOS of the Hubble telescope. The distribution in quasar redshifts allowed ZK97 to span the\nwavelength range of 310\u20133000 \u00c5 in the quasar restframe. Before merging their spectra, each spectrum\nwas corrected for the Lyman valley and Ly\u03b1 forest\nabsorption by calculating the appropriate transmission curve, using the scheme developed by M\u00f8ller &\nJakobsen (1990).\nOur aim is to reproduce the steepening of the\nindex by introducing a previously unknown intergalactic absorption component. We hereby investigate how such a component can reproduce the mean\ncomposite spectrum of ZK97. Given the exploratory\nnature of the exercise, we can either postulate the\nexistence of a very tenuous but continuous gas component, or a large collection of very thin discrete\nclouds. At any rate, these two formalisms would\n1\n\n\f2\n\nBINETTE ET AL.\n\nprovide an incomplete picture if the gas distribution\nresembled that of the Ly\u03b1 forest absorption gas (e.g.\nDav\u00e9 et al. 1997). If the postulated component consisted of clumps, they must be sufficiently optically\nthin (and numerous) so that they do not show up as\nindividually detectable Ly\u03b1 absorption lines in the\narchived FOS spectra, hence NH 0 \u226a 1012 cm\u22122 .\nFor definiteness, we adopt a uniform gas distribution. The spectra are divided in energy bins, and\nfor each quasar rest-frame wavelength bin j, we calculated the transmitted intensity I\u03bbtrj = I\u03bbj T\u03bbj =\nI\u03bbj e\u2212\u03c4 (\u03bbj ) by integrating the opacity along the lineof-sight to a quasar of redshift zQ\nP10 R z\n\u03bbj\ndl\n(1)\n) nH 0 (z) dz\ndz\n\u03c4 (\u03bbj ) = i=0 0 Q \u03c3i ( 1+z\nwhere \u03bbj is the quasar rest-frame wavelength for bin\nj and nH 0 (z) the intergalactic neutral hydrogen density. The summation was carried out over the different opacity sources: photoionization (i = 0) and\nline absorption from the Lyman series of hydrogen\n(1 \u2264 i \u2264 10). Although our code could include up\nto 40 levels, we found that considering only the 10\nlowest proved to be adequate. We adopted a fiducial velocity dispersion b of 30 km/s and assumed a\nGaussian profile for the \u03c3i of the lines.\n3. CALCULATIONS\nAfter various trial and error calculations, experimenting with many different functional forms for\nnH 0 , we found that the following two distributions\nof Hi with redshift could reproduce the composite\nspectrum of ZK97 quite well :\n\u2032 0.8\nnH 0 (z) = n0H 0 (zQ\n) (1 + z)1.5\n\n(A)\n\n\u221a 0.7\n\u2032\nnH 0 (z) = n0H 0 (zQ\nz) (1 + z)3 /\u0393(z) (B)\nwhere z is the absorbing gas redshift, zQ the quasar\n\u2032\nredshift, zQ\nthe quasar redshift as seen from the ab\u2032\nsorbing gas at z [that is zQ\n= (1 + zQ )/(1 + z) \u2212 1]\nand \u0393(z) is the parameterized photoionization rate\ncoefficient (Haardt & Madau 1996) due to the metagalactic ionizing radiation but renormalized in such\na way that \u0393(z = 0) = 1 :\n\u0393(z) = (1 + z)0.73 e\u22120.526((z\u22122.3)\n\n2\n\n\u22122.32 ))\n\nThe values of n0H 0 at zero redshift are 4.8 \u00d7\n10\ncm\u22123 and 1.35 \u00d7 10\u221211 cm\u22123 for (A) and (B),\nrespectively. While the gas is photoionized by the\nmetagalactic radiation in the case of (B), in (A) the\nneutral fraction is 'frozen in' since \u0393(z) \u221a\nis absent.\nOther factors such as the dependence on z in distribution (B), or the exponent of the factor (1 + z)\n\u221212\n\nFig. 1. The dotted line represents the composite spectrum of quasars constructed by Zheng et al. (1997),\nadding together both radio-quiet and radio-loud quasars.\nThe short-dashed straight line represents a fit, in the UV\nrange \u03bb > 1200 \u00c5, of the continuum underlying the emission lines (F\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u22121 ). The solid line is a calculated composite spectrum assuming a tenuous absorption screen of\nHi as given by distribution (A). The dotted long-dashed\nline corresponds to distribution (B).\n\n(associated to its evolution during expansion of the\nUniverse), are not superfluous but essential to the fit\n(and to the aim of reproducing the spectral index of\n\u2243 \u22122 beyond 900\u00c5). Either distribution is quite successful in reproducing the break as shown in Fig. 1.\nWe have assumed that the intrinsic quasar distribution exhibits no break and can be described by a\nsingle power-law F\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u22121 at all the wavelengths of\ninterest1 . Possible interpretations of either distribution are not straightforward, due to the presence of\nfactors varying as zq\u2032 . It could imply that the gas\nis anticorrelated with large baryonic mass accumulation (as represented by the quasars environment)\nand is presumably associated with the largest voids.\nThe way in which we simulate the theoretical\ncalculation of a composite spectrum is by averaging\nmany redshifted spectral distributions as explained\nin more detail in Binette et al. (2002). The spectrograph wavelength window was assumed to be 3000 \u00c5\nto 1300 \u00c5 which we considered typical of the wavelength coverage of individual quasars by FOS. We\nredshifted this window in locked steps to cover the\n1 A soft ISED with \u03b1 = \u22122 would appear as an horizontal\nline segment in a LogF\u03bb vs. Log\u03bb plot such as Fig. 1.\n\n\fTHE ISED OF QUASARS\n\n3\n\nresults.\n\u2032\nIf we substitute zQ\nby z in distributions (A) or\n(B), the flattening observed in the composite spectrum can be reproduced although it gives rise to a\nsignificant dip at 1216 \u00c5, which is not observed. Furthermore, the behavior of \u03b1EUV vs. zQ becomes incompatible with the results of TZ02.\n5. DISCUSSION\n\nFig. 2. Behavior of the far UV power law-index of the absorbed ISED, \u03b1EU V , as a function of quasar redshift. The\nsolid line and the dotted long-dashed lines correspond to\nassuming distribution (A) and (B), respectively.\n\nredshift span 0.33 \u2264 z \u2264 3.6. Before averaging, each\nsimulated quasar SED was multiplied by the redshift\nintegrated transmission curve (c.f. Eqn. 1), taking\ninto account the intervening gas described by the distribution (A) or (B). We assumed the concordance\n\u039bCDM cosmology with \u03a9\u039b = 0.7 , \u03a9M = 0.3 and\nH0 = 67 km/s/Mpc.\n4. RESULTS\nThe distribution (B), which takes the metagalactic background radiation into\u221aaccount, requires the\ninsertion of the extra factor z in order to fit the\nobserved ISED. Otherwise, the simulated spectrum\ncurves down much too steeply at the short wavelength end. Naively, one would prefer distribution\n(A) with frozen in ionization, since it is a simpler\nexpression. A more convincing argument in favor\nof (A), however, is the behavior of the power-law\nindex \u03b1EUV of the transmitted ISED in the wavelength range \u03bb < 900 \u00c5. This is shown in Fig. 2\nas a function of the quasar redshift zQ used in the\ntransmission function. The distribution (B) shows a\nsignificant slope for \u03b1EUV while for (A) the variation is relatively small, confined to the interval\n\u22121.4 < \u03b1EUV < \u22121.9.\nOne of the interesting result of TZ02 (c.f. their\nFig. 12) is that there is no global trend of \u03b1EUV as\na function of redshift. The slope they found in their\nlinear regression of \u03b1EUV vs. Log zQ was 0.09 \u00b1 0.56\nand \u22120.33 \u00b1 0.66 for the populations of radio-quiet\nand radio-loud quasars, respectively. Considering\nthe large dispersion in the \u03b1EUV values measured,\nour slope of \u22120.52 obtained by linear fit of the solid\nline in Fig. 2 cannot be ruled out (we considered\nradio-loud and radio-quiet quasars together), while\nthat of distribution (B) is undoubtedly inconsistent\n(giving a linear fit slope of \u22121.71) with the TZ02\n\nThe simpler distribution (A) is in better agreement with the available data and is marginally consistent with the study of \u03b1EUV by TZ02. Furthermore, it is not plagued by the two problems encountered by Binette et al. (2002), who explored different\ndistributions of nH 0 (z) which relied on a long range\nproximity effect. Interestingly, a frozen in ionization for the proposed tenuous absorption component\nmakes sense since it would be similar to that believed\nto occur in the Ly\u03b1 forest at high redshift.\nThe fact that the frozen in solution is favored\nis consistent with the tenuous absorption component being of sufficiently low density that it did not\nhave time to recombine (as the background subsided)\nand/or cool from a high temperature state. If the\nproposed tenuous absorption component turned out\nto be valid, the problem of a too soft ISED as discussed by Korista, Ferland & Baldwin (1997) would\ngo away since the favored intrinsic index of \u22121 used\nhere imply a hard ionizing spectrum in quasars.\nThis work was supported by the Mexican science\nfunding agency CONACyT under grant 32139-E.
