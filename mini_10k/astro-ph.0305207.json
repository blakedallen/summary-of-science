We present submillimeter observations of rotational transitions of carbon monoxide from J = 2 \u2192 1\nup to 7 \u2192 6 for a sample of Asymptotic Giant Branch stars and red supergiants. It is the first time that the high\ntransitions J = 6 \u2192 5 and 7 \u2192 6 are included in such a study. With line radiative transfer calculations, we aim\nto determine the mass-loss history of these stars by fitting the CO line intensities. We find that the observed line\nintensities of the high transitions, including the J = 4 \u2192 3 transition, are significantly lower than the predicted\nvalues. We conclude that the physical structure of the outflow of Asymptotic Giant Branch stars is more complex\nthan previously thought. In order to understand the observed line intensities and profiles, a physical structure\nwith a variable mass-loss rate and/or a gradient in stochastic gas velocity is required. A case study of the AGB\nstar WX Psc is performed. We find that the CO line strengths may be explained by variations in mass-loss on\ntime scales similar to those observed in the separated arc-like structures observed around post-AGB stars. In\naddition, a gradient in the stochastic velocity may play a role. Until this has been sorted out fully, any mass loss\ndeterminations based upon single CO lines will remain suspect.\n\n1. Introduction\nLow and intermediate mass stars (1 < M < 8 M\u2299 ) end\ntheir life on the red giant branch and asymptotic giant\nbranch (AGB; see Habing 1996, and references herein).\nDuring the AGB phase, the stars have very extended tenuous atmospheres and shed almost their entire hydrogenrich envelope through a dense and dusty stellar wind. In\ncase of OH/IR stars, mass-loss rates can be so high that\nthe dust shell completely obscures the central star, and\nthe object is observable only at infrared wavelengths and\nthrough molecular line emission at radio wavelengths. The\nAGB phase is one of the few occasions in stellar evolution\nwhen time scales are not driven by nuclear (shell) burning but by surface mass loss. Helped by the low surface\ngravity and strong stellar pulsations, gas can move away\nfrom the star and will gradually cool. When the temperature drops below \u223c1400 K, dust formation occurs, and\nSend offprint requests to: F. Kemper (kemper@astro.ucla.edu)\n\u22c6\nSIRTF Fellow\n\na dust driven wind will develop. The mass-loss rates increase from \u1e40 \u2248 10\u22127 to a few times 10\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , while\nthe AGB star evolves from the Mira phase to an OH/IR\nstar (van der Veen & Habing 1988). Recently, it has been\nsuggested that higher mass-loss rates can be achieved for\noxygen-rich AGB stars. Justtanont et al. (1996) find that\nOH 26.5+0.6 has undergone a recent increase in mass loss,\nleading to a current rate of 5.5 * 10\u22124 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , a result recently confirmed by Fong et al. (2002). Even higher massloss rates were found for another oxygen-rich AGB star,\nIRAS 16342\u22123814, for which the mass-loss rate may be as\nhigh as \u223c10\u22123 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (Dijkstra et al. 2003). A similar\nrate of a few times 10\u22123 M\u2299 yr\u22121 is found for the carbonrich evolved star AFGL 2688 (Skinner et al. 1997).\nAGB stars are important contributors of dust to the\ninterstellar medium (ISM); it is estimated that a substantial fraction of the interstellar dust is produced by oxygenrich AGB stars (e.g. Gehrz 1989). In the outflow of evolved\nstars with an oxygen-rich chemistry the dust composition\nis dominated by silicates, both amorphous and crystalline\n\n\f2\n\nF. Kemper et al.: Mass loss and rotational CO emission from Asymptotic Giant Branch stars\n\n(e.g. Sylvester et al. 1999; Molster et al. 2002). The appearance of crystalline silicate features in the far-infrared\nspectra of AGB stars seems to be correlated with a high\noptical depth in the amorphous silicate resonance at 9.7\n\u03bcm and hence a high mass-loss rate (Waters et al. 1996;\nCami et al. 1998; Sylvester et al. 1999). This could be interpreted as evidence that a certain threshold value for the\ndensity is required to form crystalline silicates. However,\nKemper et al. (2001) showed that observational selection\neffects may play an important role in detecting crystalline\nsilicates in AGB stars with low mass-loss rates. Therefore,\nthe relation between mass-loss rate and crystallinity remains unclear at present.\nIn order to further study the correlation between the\nwind density and the dust composition, reliable massloss rates should be determined. Mass-loss rates of AGB\nstars can be obtained from the thermal emission from\ndust, predominantly coming from the warm inner regions\n(e.g. Bedijn 1987). They can also be inferred from observations of molecular transitions, in particular from CO\n(e.g. Knapp & Morris 1985). A catalogue compiled by\nLoup et al. (1993) lists observations of the CO J = 1 \u2192 0\nand J = 2 \u2192 1 transitions of both O-rich and C-rich\nAGB stars. (Hereafter we will use for these rotational transitions the notation CO(1\u22120) etc.) The mass-loss rates\nof a large number of objects from the catalogue are derived. However, the derived mass-loss rates seem to be\nunderestimated for OH/IR stars, compared to the dust\nmass loss. Heske et al. (1990) have studied the correlation between IRAS colours and mass-loss rates derived\nfrom CO(2\u22121) and CO(1\u22120) observations. In the case\nof very massive dust shells, they find that the intensity\nof the CO(1\u22120) transition is too low compared to the\nCO(2\u22121) transition, which they suspect to be due to a\nmass-loss rate increase over time. This then hints towards\na superwind phase, which is generally believed to be important in the evolution of a Mira towards an OH/IR\nstar (e.g. Iben Jr. & Renzini 1983, and references herein).\nThe superwind model was initially introduced to explain\nthe amount of mass seen in planetary nebulae assuming\nthat Miras are the progenitors of these nebulae (Renzini\n1981). Miras are believed to evolve into OH/IR stars when\nthey suddenly increase their mass-loss rate with a factor\nof \u223c100.\nAs the inner regions are warmer they are better probed\nby higher rotational transitions. Thus a sudden density\njump should be detectable in the CO lines. Model calculations by Justtanont et al. (1996) have demonstrated this\neffect for OH 26.5+0.6, using observations of rotational\ntransitions up to CO(4\u22123). Unfortunately this transition\nis not sufficiently high to firmly establish the recent onset of a superwind, as its excitation temperature is only\n55 K. Nevertheless, Justtanont et al. (1996) found that\nthe peak intensities of these lines were significantly higher\nthan what could be expected based on the extrapolation\nof the observed line strength of the CO(2\u22121) transition\nand the upper limit obtained for the CO(1\u22120) transition,\nassuming a constant mass-loss rate. Similar results are\n\nTable 1. Technical details of the JCMT heterodyne receivers.

For the first time, observations of rotational\ntransitions up to CO (7\u22126) have been obtained (Tex =\n155 K) which probe the more recent mass-loss phases.

Concluding remarks and an outlook to future work\nis presented in Sect. 5.\n\n2. Observations and data reduction\n2.1. Instrumental set-up\nObservations of the 12 CO(2\u22121), (3\u22122), (4\u22123), (6\u22125) and\n(7\u22126) rotational transitions in the outflow of evolved\nstars were obtained during several observing periods between April 2000 and September 2002 using the James\nClerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) on Mauna Kea, Hawaii.\nFor this purpose, all five different heterodyne receivers\navailable at the JCMT were used, including the new\nMPIfR/SRON E-band receiver which operates in the\n790\u2013840 GHz frequency range. A description of this new\nreceiver is given in Sect. 2.2. The technical details and\nbeam properties of the JCMT set up with the appropriate heterodyne receivers are summarized in Table 1.\nObservations with the B3- and W-receivers were performed in double sideband (DSB) and dual polarization\nmode. The DSB mode was also used for the observations\nwith the MPIfR/SRON E-band receiver. The bandwidth\nconfiguration of the receiver, and hence the spectral resolution was determined by the expected line width of the\nCO lines. We used bandwidths of at least twice the expected line width to have a sufficiently broad region for\nbaseline subtraction. Estimates for the line width \u2013 which\nis determined by the outflow velocity \u2013 were based on published values of line widths of the CO(1\u22120) transition (e.g.\nLoup et al. 1993, and references herein).\nWe used the beam-switching technique to eliminate\nthe background.

This\nPI system is in operation at the JCMT Cassegrain focus cabin since spring 2000. The receiver consists of a\nsingle-channel fixed-tuned waveguide mixer with a diagonal horn. The mixer consists of a Nb SIS junction with\nNbTiN and Al wiring layers fabricated at the University\nof Groningen, The Netherlands. Details on the fabrication\nof similar devices can be found in Jackson et al. (2000).\nMeasured receiver temperatures at the cryostat window\nare TRx \u2243 550 K DSB. The receiver has an intermediate\nfrequency of 2.5 \u2212 4 GHz. System temperatures including\natmospheric losses varied between 6000\u201314000 K (SSB)\nat the time of the observations. The beam shape and efficiency have been determined through observations of Mars\nand yield a deconvolved half power beam width (HPBW)\nof 6\u2032\u2032 and a main beam efficiency \u03b7mb of 24%.\n\n2.3. Observations and data reduction\nOur sample of evolved stars is given in Table A.1, which\nalso indicates the distances towards the programme stars.\nThe sample includes AGB stars and red supergiants. In\nTable A.2 an overview of the observed transitions is given,\nincluding cumulative integration times and the observing\ndate. The data were obtained over a long period from April\n2000 until September 2002 in flexible observing mode, and\nare part of a larger ongoing programme. During the observations, spectra of CO spectral standards used at the\nJCMT were also obtained. If necessary, a multiplication\nfactor was applied to the observations of our sample stars,\nto correct for variations in the atmospheric conditions.\nThese factors are listed in Col. 4 of Table A.2 and are\nbased on measured standard spectra. Reliable standards\nare only available for the transitions observed with the\nA3-, B3- and W/C-receivers, for which the flux calibration\naccuracy is around 10%. For the W/D- and MPIfR/SRON\nE-band reliable standards for our lines of interest are lacking. Therefore we estimate that the absolute flux calibration in these bands has an accuracy of 30%.\nTable 1 lists the beam efficiencies \u03b7mb for all receivers.\nThe main beam temperatures were calculated according\nto Tmb = TA\u2217 /\u03b7mb , where TA\u2217 is the measured antenna\ntemperature. These main beam temperatures can directly\nbe compared to observations from other telescopes.\nThe reduced data is presented in Table A.3. A linear\nbaseline has been subtracted from the raw data, and the\nspectrum has been rebinned to improve the signal-to-noise\nratio. We aimed to cover the line profile with at least \u223c80\nbins, which limits the rebinning factor. The bin sizes after\nrebinning and the corresponding r.m.s. values are listed in\n\nFig. 1. Correction of the profile of the CO(3\u22122) transition of VX Sgr. The dotted line represents the observation in which the interstellar contribution is clearly visible. Ignoring the interstellar contribution results in the\nsolid line, which is used to obtain the integrated intensity.\nCols. 4 and 5 of Table A.3. Emission lines were detected\nin almost all observations, except for \u03b1 Sco CO(3\u22122) and\nOH 104.9+2.4 CO(6\u22125) and (7\u22126), for which we only\nobtained upper limits on the main beam temperatures.\nThe line profiles of all transitions are shown in Figs. A.1\u2013\nA.21. In some cases, interstellar lines are visible in the\nspectrum, for example in VX Sgr. To determine the integrated intensities we have cut the interstellar lines out\nof the spectrum, and interpolated both parts of the spectrum, as is demonstrated in Fig. 1. The resulting profile\nwas integrated to obtain I, which is the integrated intensity in K km s\u22121 . The system velocity VLSR and the terminal expansion velocity v\u221e are estimated directly from\nthe line profile. The lines show a wide variety of shapes.\nThere are parabolic line profiles, like those of WX Psc\n(Fig. A.1), IRC+50137 (Fig. A.5), AFGL 5379 (Fig. A.10),\nCRL 2199 (Fig. A.12) and OH 104.9+2.4 (Fig. A.21).\nThese parabolic line profiles indicate that the lines are\noptically thick (Morris 1980). On the other hand, many\nobjects show signs the double-horned profiles indicative\nof an optically thin molecular layer. The most illustrative\nexample is VY CMa, in which the CO(2\u22121) and CO(3\u22122)\ntransitions clearly show a double-peaked profile, although\nthe peak around the central velocity indicates a more complex outflow structure (Fig. A.9). In addition, some flattopped profiles are observed, most notably those of VX Sgr\n(Fig. A.11). These flat-topped line profiles are considered\nto be characteristic of molecular layers which have \u03c4 \u223c 1\nat these frequencies (Morris 1980).\nJusttanont et al. (1996) have observed OH 26.5+0.6\nwith the JCMT as well and report that they find line\nintensities I = 25.8 and 36.0 K km s\u22121 for the CO(3\u22122)\nand (4\u22123) transition respectively. In addition they have\nscaled IRAM observations of the CO(2\u22121) to a 15m dish,\nto mimic the JCMT. The intensity of this line turned out\nto be 7.8 K km s\u22121 . Their results agree well with our\nresults in case of the CO(2\u22121) and (3\u22122) transition, but\n\n\f4\n\nF. Kemper et al.: Mass loss and rotational CO emission from Asymptotic Giant Branch stars\n\nthey have observed an intensity of a factor of \u223c2 higher\nfor the CO(4\u22123) transition. The origin of the discrepancy\nwith our results is unknown.\n\n3. Physical conditions in the outflow: a model\nThe observed line profiles provide information on the\nphysical structure of the outflow of these AGB stars,\nas the spectral resolution at the observed frequencies is\nsufficiently high to resolve the velocity structure. The\nterminal expansion velocity v\u221e can be derived directly\nfrom the width of the line profile (Table A.3). The\nmodel we use to analyze the CO data is based on a\nstudy by Sch\u00f6nberg (1988) and was previously used by\nJusttanont et al. (1994). The interpretation of our observations using this model is discussed in Sect. 4.\n\n3.1. Description of the model\nThe code consists of two parts: The first part solves\nthe radiation transfer equation in the co-moving frame\n(Mihalas et al. 1975), computes the level populations\n(in full non-LTE) and iterates until level populations\nand radiation field are consistent. For solving the\nlevel populations, a Newton-Raphson method is used\n(Sch\u00f6nberg & Hempe 1986). The calculations take into\naccount (de-)excitation through collisions, of which the\nrate is defined by the thermal velocity distribution, calculated from the local temperature, as well as (de-)excitation\ninduced by a local radiation field and spontaneous deexcitation. The code treats pure rotational transitions in\nthe ground and first vibrational levels, which are connected through these collisional and radiative transitions.\nThe model can calculate the populations of as many as\n50 levels at once, and is also applicable to molecules other\nthan CO. The non-LTE rate equations to determine the\nlevel populations are described by\nni\n\nX\n\n(Aij + Cij + Bij J ij ) \u2212\n\nj6=i\n\nX\n\nnj (Aji + Cji + Bji J ij ) = 0\n\n(1)\n\nj6=i\n\nA change from level i to level j can be induced by\ncollisional transitions (with the collisional rate Cij ) and\nradiative transitions, including spontaneous emission (Aij ,\nwhere Aij = 0 for i < j) and stimulated emission and\nabsorption (Bij J ij ). The collisional transition rates Cij\nare taken from laboratory measurements and potentials\ncalculations (Flower & Launay 1985) and are extended up\nto J = 30.\nThe line profile integrated mean intensity J ij consists\nof two components:\ni) The continuum radiation, originating from dust locally\npresent. This radiation field can be switched off, by\nassuming there is no dust present in the considered\npart of the outflow.\n\nii) Line radiation originating from a local region. The\nsize of this region is defined by a velocity which\nSch\u00f6nberg (1988) and also Justtanont et al. (1994)\nhave referred to as stochastic velocity vsto . The nature\nof this stochastic velocity is not specified, but physically should consist of a thermal component vtherm and\na turbulent component vturb , given by\np\n(2)\nvsto = (vtherm )2 + (vturb )2\nIn the outflow, the stochastic velocity is assumed to be\nconstant and in almost all cases dominated by turbulence. The effect of the stochastic velocity is Doppler\nbroadening of the lines, which is taken into account in\nthe radiative transfer.\n\nIn the second part of the code, the calculated level\npopulations are used as input to determine the observable\nline profiles by ray-tracing. Again the stochastic velocity\nis used, this time to determine the width of the interaction\nregion along the line-of-sight to the observer. Integration\nover the full beam, for which the telescope parameters are\nrequired, yields the emergent line profile.\n\n3.2. Free parameters\nThe model has a number of free parameters (see Table 2).\nIn this section we will discuss the various parameters and\ntheir relevance for the model calculations.\n\n3.2.1. Density profile\nThe density profile \u03c1(r) of the outflow determines the collision probabilities and optical depths required to solve\nEqs. (1) and to calculate the line profiles. The density\nprofiles follows from the equation of mass continuity\n\u03c1(r) =\n\n4\u03c0r2\n\n\u1e40\nvexp (r)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the expansion (or outflow) velocity profile used in\nthe model is defined by\n\u0012\n\u0013\nb\n(4)\nvexp (r) = v\u221e 1 \u2212\nr\nIn this equation v\u221e represents the terminal velocity.\nConstant b is chosen such that the expansion velocity at\nthe stellar surface is given by vexp (R\u2217 ) = 10\u22122 v\u221e . The\ndensity structure is set by the following input parameters\ni) The gas mass-loss rate \u1e40 determines the mass input at\nthe inner radius of the circumstellar shell. Our model\nallows us to simulate the effect of a time-variable massloss rate introducing one jump in the mass-loss history\nat an arbitrary point in the outflow (rsuperwind ), where\nthe density can increase or decrease with a specified\nfactor. Except for this jump the mass-loss rate is constant, and therefore the density profile scales with the\ncurrent mass-loss rate at r < rsuperwind and with the\npast mass-loss rate at r > rsuperwind .\n\n\fF. Kemper et al.: Mass loss and rotational CO emission from Asymptotic Giant Branch stars\n\n5\n\nii) The density profile also scales with the outflow velocity\nprofile given in Eq. (4), which is fixed by the terminal\nvelocity v\u221e .\niii) The stellar radius R\u2217 determines the base of the wind.\nThe density \u03c1(R\u2217 ) at the inner radius follows from R\u2217 ,\n\u1e40 and vexp (R\u2217 ) using the equation of mass continuity\n(3).\niv) The outer radius Rout denotes the extent of the outflow.\n\n3.2.2. Temperature profile\nThe temperature profile T (r) is another important parameter that influences the level populations in the circumstellar CO, by means of collisions. The temperature profile may be compiled self-consistently, i.e. based\non calculations of realistic heating and cooling processes\n(e.g. Goldreich & Scoville 1976; Justtanont et al. 1994;\nChen & Neufeld 1995; Zubko & Elitzur 2000). As a first\norder estimate we have used a power law of the form\nT (r) \u221d r\u2212\u03b1 , where the index \u03b1 depends on the mass-loss\nrate and is derived from the outer regions of the temperature profiles calculated by Justtanont et al. (1994).\n\n3.2.3. Dust-to-gas ratio and dust properties\nUnfortunately it is difficult to study the gas and dust\nmass-loss rate completely independent from each other,\nas continuum emission from dust may have an effect on\nthe (de-)excitation rates, as described in Sect. 3.1. In particular, infrared photons at 4.6 \u03bcm pump CO molecules\nfrom the ground vibrational state v = 0 to the first vibrational level v = 1 (e.g. Morris 1980; Sch\u00f6nberg 1988).\nThe molecules will eventually de-excite to the vibrational\nground level, but not necessarily to the same rotational\nground level. This causes a higher population of the higher\nCO rotational levels than which reflects the kinetic temperature of the gas and the line radiation field. As the\nsource of the 4.6 \u03bcm radiation is predominantly thermal\ndust emission, the dust-to-gas ratio and the dust opacity are important input parameters. For simplicity, we assumed that there was no dust present in the outflows. For\nsome of the calculations we did include dust to study the\neffect on the line strengths. In those cases we used a dust\nopacity corresponding to the mixture of solid state components derived for OH 127.8+0.0, a typical OH/IR star\n(Kemper et al. 2002). The same power-law temperature\ndistribution as for the gas is used to calculate the thermal\nemission from the grains, although this is most likely not\ntrue.\n\nFig. 2. Overview of integrated intensities for each line observed in our programme stars. The horizontal axis of\neach panel lists the rotational transitions observed, where\nthe spacing between the tick marks is proportional to\nthe difference in frequency. On the vertical axis the integrated intensity (K km s\u22121 ) is given. The diamonds\nrepresent the measured values; in addition the error bars\nare shown (data from Table A.3). Note that only the line\nstrengths of VY CMa increase with higher rotational transitions. For most of the other stars (except OH 127.8+0.0,\nIRC +50137 and IRAS 21554+6204) CO (3\u22122) is the\nbrightest line. In the upper right corner the relative values\nfor the standard model (see Table 2, Fig. 3) are presented\nfor comparison (indicated with \u00d7 symbols).\nand the velocity law given in Eq. (4)) and the stochastic\nvelocity vsto determine the location and extent of the interaction regions. As said before, the stochastic velocity is\nassumed to be constant throughout the dust shell.\n\n3.2.5. Distance and telescope parameters\nThe resulting main beam temperatures depend on the distance towards the object. In addition, the telescope beam\nsize is important to determine what part of the object falls\ninside the beam. In case the circumstellar shell is resolved,\nthe pointing displacement (usually 0\u2032\u2032 ) should be known\nas well.\n\n3.2.4. Velocity field\nThe velocity field has already been mentioned as a constraint for the density structure, but it also plays an important role in the formation of line profiles. The outflow\nvelocity profile (constrained by the terminal velocity v\u221e\n\n4. Analysis of the results\nHere we will analyze the observations using the model described in Sect. 3. Fig. 2 shows the intensities integrated\nover line width of each observed line for all our sample\n\n\f6\n\nF.

Line profiles calculated for a standard AGB model,\nfolded with the JCMT beams. The model parameters are\ngiven in Table 2.\n\nstars. For all sources, except VY CMa, the integrated intensity increases from the CO(2\u22121) to (3\u22122) transition,\nand decreases again for higher transitions. This is also visible in the peak main beam temperatures Tmb (Table A.3).\nSince most studies concentrate on the lower transitions\n(up to CO(3\u22122)) this was not noticed before. An exception are the JCMT observations of OH 26.5+0.6 performed by Justtanont et al. (1996), where the CO(4\u22123)\ntransition is included as well. However, as pointed out in\nSect. 2.3, they observed an increasing line strength with\nincreasing rotational transition. This differs from our observations of this object that the CO(3\u22122) is the strongest\nemission line.\nIn order to explain the observational trends, we have\nconstructed a standard model assuming physical parameters widely used for AGB outflows (see Table 2). We used\na mass-loss rate of \u1e40 = 10\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , and calculated the\nlevel populations of the CO gas between the stellar radius\nR\u2217 = 4.0 * 1013 cm and the outer radius Rout = 6000 R\u2217.\nFor the terminal velocity we used v\u221e = 15.0 km s\u22121\nand the turbulent velocity was assumed to be vsto = 1.0\nkm s\u22121 . A power-law temperature profile was chosen:\nT (r) = 2000 (r/R\u2217 )\u22120.7 K. We used for the relative abundance of the CO gas with respect to molecular hydrogen\n[CO]/[H2 ] = 3.0 * 10\u22124 , and we ignored the contribution\nof thermal emission from dust to the local radiation field.\nFinally, we placed this system at a distance of 1000 pc,\nand used the JCMT telescope parameters to calculate the\nemerging line profiles (Table 2, Fig. 3). The lines show\nincreasing peak and integrated intensities with increasing\nline strengths, up to CO(6\u22125). The CO(7\u22126) line is again\nmuch weaker which can be explained by the relatively narrow HPBW of the E-band (Table 1). This transition is\ncomparable in strength to the CO(2\u22121) transition, for this\nstandard set of parameters. This is a general characteristic\nof all other studies calculating the line intensities for com-\n\nvalue\n1.0 kpc\n15.0 km s\u22121\n1.00 km s\u22121\n5 R\u2217\n6000 R\u2217\n4.0 * 1013 cm\n10\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121\n2000 (r/R\u2217 )\u22120.7 K\n3.0 * 10\u22124\n0%\n\nmonly used AGB parameters (e.g. Groenewegen 1994a,b;\nJusttanont et al. 1994).\nIn the following sections we will try to find a set of\nparameters to explain our observations: in general the\nCO(3\u22122) is the strongest line, which contradicts the results of the standard model. In order to study as many\nstars as possible in a systematic way, we will use a\nline ratio diagram based on the CO(3\u22122)/CO(2\u22121) and\nCO(4\u22123)/CO(2\u22121) ratios of integrated intensities, rather\nthan trying to fit the intensities and line profiles.\nThe two low mass-loss rate AGB stars RV Boo and\nX Her are added to the sample; these stars are the only\nones for which sufficient reliable line ratios of interest can\nbe derived from published JCMT data (see Table A.4).\nFor RV Boo the ratios of the integrated intensities are 1.5\nand 2.0 for CO(3\u22122)/CO(2\u22121) and CO(4\u22123)/CO(2\u22121)\nrespectively (Bergman et al. 2000). For X Her these\nnumbers are 2.1 and 3.4 respectively (Knapp et al.\n1998; Kerschbaum & Olofsson 1999). The observations\nof Knapp et al. (1998) were obtained with the CalTech\nSubmillimeter Observatory (CSO) and are rescaled to\nthe JCMT observations of Kerschbaum & Olofsson (1999)\nsuch that the line intensities of the CO(3\u22122) transitions\nboth reflect the same dish size and can be compared to our\nCO(3\u22122) and CO(2\u22121) observations. One should bear in\nmind however, that RV Boo and X Her are not representative of AGB stars with spherical outflows. Kahane & Jura\n(1996) have mapped X Her in CO lines and conclude that\nin addition to a slow spherically expanding shell there\nare indications for bipolar outflows with a higher velocity, which carry a significant fraction of the ejected gas.\nThis result is confirmed by Kerschbaum et al. (2003), who\nin addition present SiO line observations indicative of a\ncircumstellar rotating disk. Interferometric CO line observations of RV Boo indicate that this object also has a\ndisk, possibly showing Keplerian rotation (Bergman et al.\n2000). Therefore, comparison of these stars with our data\nand analysis should be done with some reservation.\nIn the literature, we found a sample of six Miras, which\nwere observed in all three lines discussed here, using CSO\n(see Table A.4). It is possible to scale these observations\nto the JCMT observations by accounting for the dish size.\nHowever, we have chosen not to do this, because it is un-\n\n\fF. Kemper et al.: Mass loss and rotational CO emission from Asymptotic Giant Branch stars\n\nFig. 4. Line ratio diagram. On the horizontal axis the ratio of the integrated intensities of CO(3\u22122)/CO(2\u22121) is\ngiven, while the CO(4\u22123)/CO(2\u22121) ratio is plotted on the\nvertical axis. The diamonds represent the positions of our\nsample stars, complemented with literature data for X Her\nand RV Boo. Equal ratios are indicated with the dashed\nline. In case of our sample stars, the CO(3\u22122) transition is\nstronger than the (4\u22123) transition, therefore all observations can be found in the lower right half of the diagram.\nThe only exception is OH 127.8+0.0 which is found in the\nupper left half. The asterisks mark the positions of model\ncalculations, where we used the standard parameters (see\nTable 2). Only the mass-loss rate was varied and is given\nin units of M\u2299 yr\u22121 .\n\nknown how reliable the rescaled data still is, as little is\nknown about the beam filling factor of the various transitions, while the beam sizes of the telescopes are very different. Instead we chose to compare these observations with\nour model calculations, as will be discussed in Sect. 4.1.\n\n4.1. A constant mass-loss rate?\nIn a line-ratio diagram (Fig. 4), the observed values occupy the lower right half of the diagram, corresponding\nto the region where the CO(3\u22122) line is stronger than the\nCO(4\u22123) line. The values corresponding to OH 127.8+0.0\nare an exception and are found in the upper left half. This\ndata point should be treated with care though, as the detected lines suffer from interference with interstellar absorption (Fig. A.3) and therefore the line intensities are\nnot well known (see Table A.3). The literature data of\nRV Boo and X Her are also located in the upper left half\nof the diagram.\nFirst, we assume that the mass-loss rate is constant.\nFor five different mass-loss rates (10\u22128 , 10\u22127 , 10\u22126 , 10\u22125\nand 10\u22124 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ) we have calculated the emerging line\nprofiles, thus covering the full range in \u1e40 from Miras\nto OH/IR stars (Bedijn 1987; van der Veen & Habing\n1988). All other input parameters were assumed to have\nthe standard values given in Table 2. The predicted\nCO(3\u22122)/CO(2\u22121) and CO(4\u22123)/CO(2\u22121) ratios of the\n\n7\n\nFig. 5. Line ratio diagram for CSO data. On the\nhorizontal axis the ratio of the integrated intensities of CO(3\u22122)/CO(2\u22121) is given, while the\nCO(4\u22123)/CO(2\u22121) ratio is plotted on the vertical\naxis. The diamonds represent the ratios obtained for a\nsample of six Miras. The CO(4\u22123) and CO(3\u22122) data\nare obtained from Young (1995), and the CO(2\u22121)\ndata is taken from a study by Knapp et al. (1998). For\nR Hya and \u03c7 Cyg additional CSO CO(3\u22122) data are\navailable, from Knapp et al. (1998) and Stanek et al.\n(1995) respectively. In the diagram these measurements\nare indicated with 'R Hya K' (Knapp et al. 1998) and an\n'\u03c7 Cyg S' (Stanek et al. 1995). Equal ratios are indicated\nwith the dashed line. The asterisks mark the positions\nof model calculations, performed for the CSO beam and\ndish size, where we used the standard parameters (see\nTable 2). Only the mass-loss rate was varied and is given\nin units of M\u2299 yr\u22121 .\n\nintegrated intensities were compared to the observed ratios.\nThe model calculations (marked with asterisks) are\nfound in the upper left half of the diagram where the\nCO(4\u22123) line is stronger than the CO(3\u22122) line, and are\ntherefore not consistent with the observed line ratios. All\nmodel line ratios are found in a narrow range to one end of\nthe region where the observations are found (see Fig. 4).\nOnly the observations of RV Boo match the modelled line\nratios, but this could be merely a coincidence as RV Boo\nis not a typical AGB star.\nThere are not many reports in the literature of AGB\nstars observed in these three lines with the JCMT, but\nwe compared the results discussed here with observations\nperformed using the CSO. For that purpose, we have recalculated the model line ratios for the CSO beam and\ndish size. A sample of six Miras is consistently observed\nwith CSO, where the CO(4\u22123) and CO(3\u22122) measurements are obtained by Young (1995), and the CO(2\u22121)\nobservations by Knapp et al. (1998). Additional CSO observations of the CO(3\u22122) line in two of these objects were\nalso included (Knapp et al. 1998; Stanek et al. 1995). The\nresults are shown in Fig. 5. Similar to Fig. 4, the line ra-\n\n\f8\n\nF. Kemper et al.: Mass loss and rotational CO emission from Asymptotic Giant Branch stars\n\ntios derived from the standard calculations are found just\nabove the dashed line, indicating that the CO(4\u22123) line\nshould be stronger than the CO(3\u22122) transition. However,\nmost observations are found well below the dashed line,\nwhere the CO(3\u22122) is the strongest line. \u03c7 Cyg falls in\nthis region as well. However, if we use the measurement of\nStanek et al. (1995) for the CO(3\u22122) line, the line ratios\nbecome such that it is found in the same region as the\nmodel ratios. Possibly this point is unreliable, as it does\nnot come from a consistent data set. R Hya seems to be\nan outlier for both CO(3\u22122) measurements. Another remarkable observation is that the observed CO(2\u22121) lines\nseem to be weaker than what is expected from the model\ncalculations, given the fact that the calculated ratios are\ncloser to the origin of the plot. We may conclude that\nin general the CSO observations occupy more or less the\nsame region of the plot with respect to the model ratios as\nour observations. Therefore, in the remainder of this paper\nwe will limit our detailed analysis to our JCMT data.\nApparently, variations of the mass-loss rate alone do\nnot change the line ratios enough to significantly increase\nthe strength of the CO(3\u22122) line with respect to the\nCO(4\u22123) line. In the next section, we will investigate to\nwhat extent variations in the other parameters can shift\nthe model calculations such that the line strength ratios\nmore closely resemble the observed values.\n\n4.2. Exploring parameter space\nTo further explore parameter space, we opted to vary the\ninput parameters of the standard model (Table 2) one by\none, and compare the line ratios with the observations.\nCombining the changes in line ratios from variations in\nthe individual parameters then provides a feeling for the\nrange in line ratios that can be covered, and may show\nwhether or not it is possible to explain the observed line\nratios at all. Of course, once a satisfactory match in line\nratios is achieved by combining the effects of changes in\nindividual parameters, fine tuning should be performed to\nfit the observed data in detail. This is necessary as some\nof these parameters might not be completely independent\nfrom each other, and the precise combined effect on the\nline profile is difficult to predict.\nIn Fig. 6 a mosaic of line-ratio diagrams is shown, in\nwhich the effects of changes in the stochastic velocity,\nthe outer radius, the dust-to-gas ratio and the distance\nare shown. In general the effects due to changes in these\nparameters are small. To keep the plots readable, only\nsmall parts of the original line-ratio diagram (Fig. 4) are\nshown. The modelled line ratios for which these parameters are varied scatter mainly closely around the observed\nvalues for RV Boo. In all these modelled line strengths,\nthe CO(3\u22122) line is still weaker than the CO(4\u22123) line.\nOf course varying the parameters mentioned here causes\nchanges in the absolute line strengths, but the line ratios\nare not so much affected.\n\nFig. 6. Mosaic of diagrams representing the\nCO(4\u22123)/CO(2\u22121) ratio on the vertical axis versus\nthe CO(3\u22122)/CO(2\u22121) ratio on the horizontal axis. We\nused the standard model described in Sect. 4 and Table 2\nand varied for each panel one of the parameters. From\nthe upper left corner turning clockwise the investigated\nparameters are: the stochastic velocity vsto (km s\u22121 ),\nthe outer radius Rout (R\u2217 ), the dust-to-gas ratio and the\ndistance D (pc). The line ratios resulting from the model\ncalculations are marked with asterisks and the observed\nline ratios with diamonds. The dashed lines indicate equal\nline ratios. Note that the ranges plotted on the axes are\nsmaller than the ranges in Fig. 4 to improve readability.\n\nIn the models where the distance was varied, we placed\nthe object progressively closer to the observer, such that\nthe beam filling factor is initially less than unity, but increases with decreasing distance. Although the beam size\ncorresponding to the CO(2\u22121) transition is larger than\nthat corresponding to the CO(3\u22122) transition, the line\nformation region of the CO(2\u22121) transition is located\nso much further out that the object is first resolved for\nthe CO(2\u22121) transition. This implies that less emission\nfrom this line is received by the telescope. When this happens, the line ratios increase. The CO(4\u22123)/CO(2\u22121) line\nratio increases faster for decreasing distance than does\nCO(3\u22122)/CO(2\u22121), because the CO(3\u22122) line emission\nis the next to become resolved, as this line is formed more\ninwards in the circumstellar shell, but still further out than\nthe higher transitions.\nThe stochastic or turbulent velocity determines the interaction length along the line-of-sight, i.e. the region over\nwhich the line is formed (see also Sect. 3.1 and 3.2). The\neffect of a larger turbulent velocity is different for optically\nthick and optically thin lines. In the optically thin case,\na change in profile strength may result from changes in\nthe line source function in the (near and far) parts of the\nline interaction region, that is added relative to the default case. In the optically thick case the relevant source\nfunction is the one at the location where \u03c4 \u2248 1, which\nshifts towards the observer when vsto is increased. It may\n\n\fF.

Again, the standard model parameters (Table 2)\nwere used. Only the temperature profile was varied. From\nthe panel in the upper left corner turning clockwise the\nadopted temperature profiles are: i) T (r) \u221d r\u2212\u03b1 , with \u03b1\nindicated in the plot. ii) T (r) is described with a function\nconsisting of two power-laws.

Again, the predicted line ratios\nare marked with asterisks and the observed line ratios\nwith diamonds. The diamonds are not labelled to avoid\na crowded plot, but can easily be identified using Fig. 4.\nThe dashed lines indicate equal line ratios.\n\ntherefore differ from the default case. As these effects tend\nin the same direction for all lines (except possibly when\nlines change from optically thin to optically thick), the line\nratios are found not to change dramatically when varying\nthe turbulent velocity.\nChanging the outer radius has a stronger effect on the\nline ratios, as can be seen in Fig. 6. When the outer radius is increased, more relatively cold gas will be present.\nIn this gas mostly the lower rotational levels are populated, thus increasing predominantly the CO(2\u22121) transition. The higher the transition, the less it is affected by\nthe outer radius.\nThe last parameter shown in Fig. 6 is the dust-to-gas\nratio. The most important effect of adding dust to the\ncircumstellar shell is in the population of the rotational\nlevels. Continuum emission at 4.6 \u03bcm can be absorbed\nby CO molecules, exciting them from the ground to the\nfirst vibrational level. They will return to the vibrational\nground state by spontaneous emission, but preferentially\nto a higher rotational level than they started from. This\nhas a non-LTE effect on the level populations, leading to\nvariations in both the line strengths and the line ratios.\nWe also investigated the effect of the temperature distribution. The results are shown in Fig. 7.

The simplest approach is to consider a\npower law T (r) = T0 (r/R\u2217 )\u2212\u03b1 , where \u03b1 is usually positive and has a value around 0.5\u20130.6 for realistic profiles\n(Justtanont et al. 1994). We considered a much broader\nrange of \u03b1, including negative values and also a constant\ntemperature, i.e. \u03b1 = 0. These cases are of course not a\ntrue physical representation of the dust shell, but are just\nconsidered to study the effect of extreme conditions. In\nmost cases, we used a temperature at the inner edge of\nT0 = 2000 K. However, when the power law is shallow\n(small \u03b1), the resulting temperature at the outer radius\nwould be higher than 25 K if we use the same value for\nT0 . In that case, we adjusted T0 such that T (Rout ) = 25 K.\nThis outer boundary temperature is in the regime of excitation temperatures of the lower rotational transitions.\nFor the negative values of \u03b1, the temperature T0 was assumed to be 25 K. A number of models with \u03b1 = 0 has also\nbeen computed, see the lower left panel of Fig. 7. Adopted\ntemperatures are 10, 25, 50 and 100 K. The models with a\nconstant temperature or an outwards increasing temperature are unrealistic, but we included them in our parameter study, to see if it is possible at all to change the line\nratios significantly by changing the run of the temperature.\nTo add to the realism of the models, we composed a\nnumber of temperature profiles consisting of two power\nlaws with different values for \u03b1. These profile are inspired\nby heat balance calculations of Justtanont et al. (1994),\nand are defined as follows:\n\u001a\nT0 (r/R\u2217 )\u2212\u03b1in for T > Tex\nT (r) =\nT1 (r/R\u2217 )\u2212\u03b1out for T < Tex\nFive different profiles with a change in slope were\nconstructed, where the excitation temperatures of the\nCO(4\u22123) (Tex = 55.2 K), (3\u22122) (33.1 K) and (2\u22121) (16.6\nK) were used to define the position of the change in the\nslope. In all cases \u03b1out was chosen to be 0.7. For the\nother parameters, the reader is referred to Table 3. The\nresulting line ratios are plotted in the upper right panel of\nFig. 7. All models with a power law with a slope change\ncluster remarkably close to the CO(4\u22123)/CO(2\u22121) and\nCO(3\u22122)/CO(2\u22121) ratios observed in CRL 2199 and WX\nPsc. The only outlier is profile 2 (see Table 3). Although\nfrom the various panels in Fig. 7 it seems to be possible\nto explain the observed ratios of WX Psc and CRL 2199,\n\n\f10\n\nF.

A representative case: WX Psc\nIn order to investigate the possibilities to explain the integrated intensities of the CO rotational transitions, we will\nfocus on WX Psc. All transitions are observed and detected. The signal-to-noise ratio is reasonable for all transition, except for the CO(6\u22125) line. The previous section\nhas shown that the line ratios of the lower rotational transitions can be explained using power law temperature profiles. In this section we expand our investigations to the\nhigher rotational transitions. The observed values for the\nintegrated intensities I of the CO(6\u22125) and (7\u22126) transition are much lower than the expected values based on\nthe standard model described in Sect. 4.\nWX Psc is a well studied AGB star with an intermediate mass-loss rate. From recent studies, notably the work\nof Hofmann et al. (2001), we have retrieved the physical\ncharacteristics of the star and the circumstellar environment (see Table 4). These values were used as input parameters for our model calculations. For required parameters which are not accurately known, we maintained the\nvalues of our standard model (Table 2). We used a stellar\nradius of 5.4 * 1013 cm, implying a luminosity of 1.3 * 104\nL\u2299 for Teff = 2250 K.\nDetermination of the mass-loss rate from the integrated intensities of the rotational transitions gives an idea\nof the mass-loss history of the AGB star. Fig. 8 shows how\nthe integrated line intensities depend on it. In Table 5 the\nmass-loss rates derived from each observed transition are\nlisted, while all other parameters were kept fixed. In addition, the gas mass-loss rate, derived from the L \u2212 [12 \u03bcm]\ncolour (Kemper et al. 2002) is given, where a dust-to-gas\nratio of 1% is assumed. The dust spectral energy distribution covers a temperature range of \u223c 200 \u2212 800 K, which\n\nFig. 8. Using the known parameters of WX Psc (Table 4)\npredicted integrated intensities are given for a large range\nof mass-loss rates. Integrated intensities are plotted in a\nlogarithmic scale on the vertical axis, and mass-loss rates\n(M\u2299 yr\u22121 ) on the horizontal axis, also in logarithmic scale.\nThe integrated intensities have been calculated for all lines\nobservable with the JCMT and these calculated models\nare indicated with symbols (see legend). The models have\nbeen connected with a line. Using the observed integrated\nintensity for a certain line, the mass-loss rate of WX Psc\ncan be estimated from this plot (see Table 5).\n\ncorresponds to a region even more inwards than the CO\nline emission.\nWe conclude that constant mass-loss rate models cannot explain all of the observed line intensities. Rather,\nit seems that the mass-loss rate varies with the J-level\nunder consideration. Specifically, the mass-loss rate corresponding to the CO(2\u22121) emission is almost comparable in strength to the mass-loss rate derived from the\ndust emission (Table 5). For the higher rotational transitions, the derived mass-loss rates go down with increasing\nline frequency, although it perhaps increases slightly again\nfor the CO(7\u22126) transition. The mass-loss rates determined from the high rotational transitions disagree with\nthe mass-loss rate derived from the infrared dust emission.\nA difference of at least an order of magnitude occurs although the regions that are traced by the high rotational\ntransitions and the dust emission are closest in temperature, and are therefore spatially close together. In general,\na decreasing mass-loss rate with increasing rotational energy level is observed, which is inconsistent with predictions based on the superwind model (e.g. Groenewegen\n1994b; Justtanont et al. 1996; Delfosse et al. 1997). The\nresults derived here point towards a mass-loss rate decreasing with time, rather than a stratification consistent\nwith the onset of a superwind phase. In the next sections\nwe will try to explain this discrepancy.\n\n\fF. Kemper et al.: Mass loss and rotational CO emission from Asymptotic Giant Branch stars\n\n11\n\nTable 5.

While all\nother parameters of WX Psc were kept constant, the mass-loss rate was determined by fitting the integrated intensity.\nThe third column contains the excitation temperature of the corresponding rotational transition. The fourth and fifth\ncolumn represent the outflow distances, i.e. the distance traveled since the gas left the stellar surface, and the last\ncolumn shows the corresponding travel times. In addition to the CO mass-loss determinations, the mass-loss rate\nderived from the L \u2212 [12 \u03bcm] colour, assuming a dust-to-gas ratio of 0.01, is given (Kemper et al. 2002).\ntracer\nL \u2212 [12 \u03bcm]\nCO 7\u20136\nCO 6\u20135\nCO 4\u20133\nCO 3\u20132\nCO 2\u20131\n\n\u1e40gas\n(M\u2299 yr\u22121 )\n2.0 * 10\u22125\n3.0(\u00b10.3) * 10\u22127\n1.4(\u00b10.1) * 10\u22127\n1.3(\u00b10.1) * 10\u22126\n6.3(\u00b10.2) * 10\u22126\n8.0(\u00b10.9) * 10\u22126\n\nTex (K)\n\n155\n116\n55.1\n33.1\n16.6\n\nFig. 9.

The curves for each rotational transition\nare calculated using the mass-loss rate corresponding to\nthat transition (see Table 5).\n\n4.4. Possible explanations for the inconsistency\n4.4.1. Mass-loss variations?\nIn principle, it should be possible to construct a combination of a density and temperature profile, such that the\nobserved line intensity ratios can be explained. This is\nnot possible for a constant mass-loss rate, as becomes apparent from Fig. 7, so apparently there must also have\nbeen variations in \u1e40 . Using the WX Psc model calculations, we can derive an impression of the mass-loss history\nusing the mass-loss rates listed in Table 5. For all these\nvalues we have calculated the region where the respective line originates (Fig. 9). This is not done in terms of\nradial distance to the central star, but as a function of\nimpact parameter, in which case contributions in line-ofsights due to interactions at various radial distances have\nbeen integrated. Therefore, the values on the horizontal\naxis can not directly be translated to a radial distance towards the central star, but present a lower limit to this\ndistance. In addition, one has to bear in mind that the\n\nR/R\u2217\n\nR (cm)\n\n700\n900\n1400\n1100\n1900\n\n3.8 * 1016\n4.9 * 1016\n7.6 * 1016\n5.9 * 1016\n1.0 * 1017\n\ntravel time\n(yr)\n< 600\n600\n780\n1200\n940\n1600\n\nregions from which the various lines originate are not distinct, but largely overlap. Some overlap in Fig. 9 is due\nto projection effects along the line-of-sight, but a significant fraction is due to real physical overlap of the lineformation regions. Although all regions are plotted in one\nfigure, they do not arise from the same model but are the\ncalculated for the corresponding mass-loss rate for each\nline (see Table 5). Therefore, it is possible that the CO\n(4\u22123) seems to originate from a region that is more distant from the central star than the region where the CO\n(3\u22122) line originates, although their excitation temperatures would suggest otherwise in an outwards decreasing\ntemperature profile. Concluding, the mass-loss rates that\nwe have determined are only average values for these line\nformation regions. Nevertheless, estimates of the distances\nfrom the line forming regions towards the central star can\nbe derived for the mass-loss rates traced by the observed\ntransitions. Using a stellar radius of 5.4 * 1013 cm and an\nexpansion velocity of 20 km s\u22121 the time elapsed since\nthe ejection of the gas from the stellar surface, traced by\nthe various transitions can be calculated. The results are\nlisted in Table 5. The cycle can be completed by adding\nthe dust mass-loss, mostly originating from the region inwards of the CO(7\u22126) transition, and thus ejected less\nthan 600 years ago. Note that the dust mass-loss rate is\ntransferred into a gas mass-loss rate by assuming a dustto-gas mass ratio of 0.01. Actual deviations to this ratio\nimply a different gas mass-loss rate traced by the L \u2212 [12\n\u03bcm] colour. From Table 5 we can determine that the interval between the two maximum mass-loss rates, traced\nby the CO(2\u22121) transition and the L \u2212 [12 \u03bcm] colour of\nthe dust emission, is of the order of \u223c1000 years.\nMass-loss variations on such time scales have in\nfact been observed in other evolved stars. Circumstellar\nseries of arc-like structures have been interpreted as\ndue to mass-loss modulations, notably for C-rich postAGB stars, where the separation is a measure for the\ntime scale of these variations. Kwok et al. (1998) derive that the separation between arcs observed around\nIRAS 17150\u22123224 corresponds to a time scale of\n\n\f12\n\nF. Kemper et al.: Mass loss and rotational CO emission from Asymptotic Giant Branch stars\n\n240 yr (D/kpc) (vexp /10 km s\u22121 ). For reasonable numbers for the distance and outflow velocity one can determine that these arcs may be due to mass-loss variations on time scales of 200\u20131000 yr. A similar time scale\n(200\u2013800 yr) is derived by Mauron & Huggins (1999) for\nIRC+10216. The circumstellar arcs around CRL 2688\n(Egg Nebula) are believed to be ejected at 75\u2013200 yr intervals, assuming a distance of 1 kpc and an outflow velocity\nof 20 km s\u22121 (Sahai et al. 1998). IRAS LRS spectroscopy\nhas shown that hot dust (T > 500 K) is absent around\na number of AGB stars. This is interpreted as a drop in\nmass-loss rate which occurred \u223c100 years ago, consistent\nwith the spacing between the arcs observed around postAGB stars (Marengo et al. 2001). Hydrodynamic calculations considering the gas and dust as partially or completely decoupled outflow components resulted in massloss variations of an order of magnitude at intervals of\n200\u2013350 year for partially and 400 year for completely decoupled fluids (Simis et al. 2001). Moreover, Fong et al.\n(2003) report on the discovery of multiple shells seen in\nCO (1\u22120) emission around IRC+10216. These shells are\nfound to have intershell time scales of 1300\u20132900 year. The\ncircumstellar arcs and molecular shells observed around\npost-AGB stars and the density enhancements emerging\nfrom hydrodynamic calculations have similar time scales\nto what we derive here for mass-loss variations in the outflow of WX Psc, indicating that the same phenomenon\nmay perhaps play a role here.\nVariations in the mass-loss rate of AGB stars have\nalready been studied for a long time. It is generally accepted that the AGB phase is terminated by the superwind; a phase in which the mass-loss rate rapidly increases\n(Renzini 1981; Baud & Habing 1983). However, the massloss rates inferred from the CO line intensities for WX Psc\ndecrease with time and are thus opposite to the classical\nsuperwind model predictions. The thermal pulses associated with He-shell ignition are also thought to cause massloss variations (Vassiliadis & Wood 1993). As for the superwind, the behaviour and time scale of these variations\ndo not comply with our model predictions.\n\n4.4.2. A gradient in the turbulent velocity?\nBesides a complex density-temperature profile due to periodic mass-loss variations, there may be another way to\nexplain the line intensities of the CO rotational transitions\nobserved in WX Psc; a gradient in stochastic velocity vsto .\nThe stochastic velocity is an important parameter in the\nline formation process (see Sect. 3). Fig. 10 illustrates this\nfor the profiles of one of the rotational transitions for various stochastic velocities.\nAnalogous to the determination of the mass-loss history, it is possible to estimate the variations in the stochastic velocities traced by the integrated intensities of the\nsequence of rotational transition observed for WX Psc.\nFor this purpose, the mass-loss rate was assumed to be\nconstant at a rate of 10\u22126 M\u2299 yr\u22121 throughout the cir-\n\nFig. 10. The influence on the line profile of CO(3\u22122) due\nto variations of the stochastic velocity. The input parameters of our standard model are used (Table 2), only the\nturbulent velocity \u2013 which in our model is independent of\nr \u2013 is varied, in the range from 0.05 \u2013 2.0 km s\u22121 .\nTable 6.

The temperature profile and the other\nparameters were kept the same as the ones used in the\nmass-loss history analysis. The results are listed in Table 6.\nAgain, the line formation regions and thus the values derived here are not independent and should be seen as averages over the formation regions. The observed line intensities may be explained by a gradient in the stochastic\nvelocity if it is lowest in the outer parts of the outflow,\ntraced by the low rotational transitions, and has its maximum in the gas traced by the CO(6\u22125) transition.\nOne has to bear in mind that we derived the stochastic velocities for one particular mass-loss rate, namely\n10\u22126 M\u2299 . As pointed out before, the mass-loss rate has\na considerable effect on the line strengths as well, however, the negative gradient will be maintained for other\nchoices of \u1e40 . To explain the observations vsto has to increase to an unrealistically high maximum of 8 km s\u22121 in\nthe region of CO(6\u22125) formation and then decrease again\nto 0.16 km s\u22121 at the CO(2\u22121) formation zone.\nThe stochastic velocity can be considered as a composition of thermal and turbulent components, according to\nEq. (2). The thermal molecular velocities for CO are given\n\n\fF. Kemper et al.: Mass loss and rotational CO emission from Asymptotic Giant Branch stars\n\np\nby vtherm = 2kT /mCO , where T is the temperature at\nthe line formation region, which is usually of the order\nof the excitation temperature. For the lines observed we\ncan determine that vtherm ranges between 0.01 and 0.03\nkm s\u22121 . It is obvious that only a minor fraction of the\nrequired total stochastic velocity vsto can be explained by\nthermal motion, and also that the observed gradient is not\nsufficiently reproduced by the thermal component.\nThe nature of the remaining turbulent velocity vturb is\nunknown, but could in part be induced by stellar pulsations. These pulsations cause stochastic velocities of 2\u20135\nkm s\u22121 in the inner parts of the circumstellar shell required to start the dust formation process. However, these\nstochastic velocities will damp quickly and are practically\nabsent beyond 100 R\u2217 (Simis 2001). Hence, if variations\nin the stochastic velocity are important for the CO line\nintensities, the origin of such variations is presently unclear.\n\n4.4.3. Other factors\nOther factors that could be important include the outflow\nvelocity profile, and the geometry. Our adopted outflow\nvelocity profile is very simple (see Eq. (4)), but hydrodynamical calculations show that it may be more complex\nand also time-dependent (Simis et al. 2001). The effect of\nsuch complex outflow velocity profiles on the CO line profiles has not yet been studied. Perhaps they could serve as\na source of turbulence.\nNon-spherical winds, e.g. density enhancements in the\nequatorial region, could also play a role in the observed\nline strengths. The observed line profiles would reflect\nsuch an axi-symmetric geometry, if it exists. Close examination of the observed lines (Figs. A.1\u2013A.21) shows that\ntheir profiles are similar for all transitions (per source),\nand one can therefore conclude that the regions where the\nlines originate have almost the same velocity structure.\nApparently there is no change in geometry for the regions\ntraced by the various rotational transitions, e.g. a slowly\noutflowing disk traced by the lower transitions and a fast\npolar outflow traced by the higher transitions. Thus this\npossibility most likely can be ruled out as an explanation for the discrepancy between the observations and the\nmodel results. Only in case of VY CMa (Fig. A.9) the\nprofiles show significant differences between the lower and\nhigher rotational transitions.\n\n5. Concluding remarks\n5.1. CO rotational transitions as mass-loss indicators\nIn this work, we presented submillimeter observations of\nvarious carbon monoxide rotational transitions (CO(7\u22126),\n(6\u22125), (4\u22123), (3\u22122), (2\u22121)) observed in AGB stars\nand red supergiants in various evolutionary states. We\nhave attempted to determine the mass-loss history of\nthe programme stars by modelling of the observed transitions. For the first time the CO(7\u22126) and (6\u22125)\n\n13\n\ntransitions were used, in addition to lower transitions.\nIn this way the gap between the regions in the outflow traced by the gas and that traced by the dust\nemission was largely closed. Many studies in the past\nhave focussed on only one or two transitions to determine the gas mass-loss rate (e.g. Knapp & Morris 1985;\nLoup et al. 1993; Justtanont et al. 1994; Groenewegen\n1994b; Justtanont et al. 1996; Delfosse et al. 1997). The\nextension of the data towards higher rotational transitions clearly demonstrates that determination of a unique\ngas mass-loss rate from a single CO rotational transition is highly unreliable. We found that the observed line\nstrengths indicate that the outflow has a more complex\nphysical structure than was previously assumed. Not a\nsuperwind, but periodic mass-loss variations comparable\nto the arc-like structures and rings observed around postAGB stars, may possibly account for the observed line\nstrengths. Part of the discrepancy could be due to a gradient in the stochastic velocity as well.\nIndependently, another research group has reached\nthe same conclusion during the last year. Initially,\nOlofsson et al. (2002) modelled the mass-loss rates of a\nlarge sample of irregular and semi-regular M-type variables by fitting 2, 3 or in one case 4 CO rotational transitions by assuming a constant mass-loss rate over the last\n1000 years. They derive rates for their sample stars and do\nnot report on problems similar to ours, but their figures 2\nand 11 show that the line strength of the higher transitions\nis overestimated when this model is used. In the same volume of A&A, Sch\u00f6ier et al. (2002) describe a model that\nis able to use periodic mass-loss variations to calculate the\nrotational transitions of CO in C-rich stars. The development of this model is driven by the discovery of mass-loss\nmodulations. However, after thorough analysis, they conclude that mass-loss modulations are not important nor\nnecessary to explain the CO rotational line profiles. The\nmost recent results of Gonz\u00e1lez Delgado et al. (2003) indicate otherwise, however. When trying to derive the mass\nloss rate of more evolved Miras (i.e. with higher massloss rates than the semi-regulars), Gonz\u00e1lez Delgado et al.\n(2003) find that a model assuming a constant mass-loss\nrate underestimates the strength of the low transitions.\nThis is in principle the same as our result that the high\ntransitions are overestimated.\n\n5.2. Future work\nThe work presented here has revealed a much more complex picture of AGB stellar ejecta than previously assumed. Additional research is required, which we plan to\ndo in the near future. Of particular importance are the\nfollowing issues:\n\u2013 First, more observational data should be obtained, in\nparticular of high rotational transitions. Our study is\nthe first to include the CO(6\u22125) and (7\u22126) transitions\nin the mass-loss rate determinations of three evolved\nstars. In addition, for one object (NML Cyg) observa-\n\n\f14\n\nF. Kemper et al.: Mass loss and rotational CO emission from Asymptotic Giant Branch stars\n\ntions up to CO(6\u22125) were secured. This is not enough\nto draw firm conclusions on the degree of complexity of the physical structure in the outflows of AGB\nstars, therefore this sample should be enlarged. It is\nimportant to pay attention to the completeness: if all\ntransitions are observed, variations in the important\nphysical parameters can be much better constrained.\nIn that respect it is also worthwhile to extend the data\nwith observations of 13 CO for the lower transitions,\nwhich provide additional independent constraints on\nthe physical conditions.\n\u2013 Second, a more realistic representation of the physical\nconditions in the outflow of AGB stars should be used.\nThis includes adding a gradient in turbulence and periodic mass-loss variations as we have argued in this\nstudy. In addition, the velocity law could also be improved, e.g. following the results of Simis et al. (2001).\nAlthough these adjustments will lead to an increase in\nthe number of free parameters, it is likely that we will\nbe able to use the line profiles to constrain the model\nparameters. This will certainly help in disentangling\nthe physical structure of the outflow.\nAcknowledgements. FK is grateful for the hospitality at the\nStockholm Observatory.

For each observed transition, the peak intensity (Tmb ) is measured,\ntogether with the r.m.s. values (Col. 4) and corresponding bin sizes (Col. 5). Cols. 6 and 7 represent the velocity of\nthe object (vLSR ) and the terminal velocity (v\u221e ). The integrated line intensity (Col. 8) is determined by removing\ninterstellar absorption and emission from the profile, and integrating the remaining line profile. The accuracy on these\nvalues is at least 10% for the CO(2\u22121), (3\u22122) and (4\u22123) transitions and at least 30% for the CO(6\u22125) and (7\u22126)\ntransitions. In some cases the accuracy is deteriorated due to interstellar contamination.\nobject\nT Cet\nWX Psc\n\nOH 127.8+0.0\n\no Cet\nIRC+50137\n\u03b1 Ori\nVY CMa\n\n\u03b1 Sco\nV438 Oph\nAFGL 5379\nVX Sgr\n\nCRL 2199\n\nOH 26.5+0.6\n\nOH 30.1\u22120.7\nOH 32.8\u22120.3\nOH 44.8\u22122.3\nIRC+10420\n\nNML Cyg\n\n\u03bc Cep\nIRAS 21554+6204\nOH 104.9+2.4\n\ntransition\nCO(2\u22121)\nCO(2\u22121)\nCO(3\u22122)\nCO(4\u22123)\nCO(6\u22125)\nCO(7\u22126)\nCO(2\u22121)\nCO(3\u22122)\nCO(4\u22123)\nCO(2\u22121)\nCO(3\u22122)\nCO(2\u22121)\nCO(3\u22122)\nCO(3\u22122)\nCO(2\u22121)\nCO(3\u22122)\nCO(6\u22125)\nCO(7\u22126)\nCO(3\u22122)\nCO(2\u22121)\nCO(3\u22122)\nCO(2\u22121)\nCO(3\u22122)\nCO(4\u22123)\nCO(2\u22121)\nCO(3\u22122)\nCO(4\u22123)\nCO(2\u22121)\nCO(3\u22122)\nCO(4\u22123)\nCO(3\u22122)\nCO(3\u22122)\nCO(3\u22122)\nCO(2\u22121)\nCO(3\u22122)\nCO(4\u22123)\nCO(2\u22121)\nCO(3\u22122)\nCO(4\u22123)\nCO(6\u22125)\nCO(2\u22121)\nCO(3\u22122)\nCO(2\u22121)\nCO(3\u22122)\nCO(2\u22121)\nCO(3\u22122)\nCO(4\u22123)\nCO(6\u22125)\nCO(7\u22126)\n\nTmb (K)\n0.44\n2.35\n2.91\n1.86\n0.45\n0.82\n0.28\n0.68\n0.15\n13.80\n21.61\n1.37\n1.44\ncomplex\ncomplex\n3.00\n4.37\n7.41\n\u2013\n0.24\n2.76\ncomplex\n2.37\n1.22\n1.16\n1.25\n0.98\ncontamin.\n1.05\n0.86\ncontamin.\ncontamin.\n0.63\n1.65\n3.23\n2.84\ncomplex\ncomplex\ncomplex\ncomplex\ncomplex\ncomplex\n0.58\n0.49\n0.21\n0.43\n0.11\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\nr.m.s.
