Quantum transport\nIntroduction.\nThe phase space model according to which dynamical variables r , p \uf03d \uf068k specify the state of a\nclassical system gives classical description. For quantum systems a simultaneous specification of coordinates\nr and momenta p is not possible in view of Heisenberg uncertainty relations. A quantum mechanical\ndescription consists of a Hilbert space of states. According to the correspondence principle, the laws of\nquantum mechanics must reduce to those of classic in the limit where \uf068 tends to zero. This fundamental\nrequirement views the equations of classical mechanics as limit of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Analogously\nBoltzmann Equation (BE) can be derived from the Schr\u00f6dinger evolution of interacting particles. The\npassage from a quantum description to a classical one has been explained in detail [1-3]. But classical\ndescription of homogeneous system is the same as the quantum description if one uses a plane-waves\nrepresentation. Thus some of the Boltzmann Equation (BE) driving terms may be derived from the quantum\n\uf02b\nmechanical many-body analysis for expectation value of microscopic polarization Pk k \uf0a2 (t ) \uf03d\uf03c a k (t ) a k \uf0a2 (t ) \uf03e\nby making use a plane-waves representation in a fairly direct way [1-6]. In such a manner account of\nparticles interaction with homogeneous electric field E leads to the BE drift term, represented in the form\n\n\uf0b6PkEk\uf0a2 (t) i\nq\n\uf03d \uf0e5 [q(E \uf0d7 rk\uf0a2k1 )Pk k1 (t) \uf02d q(E\uf0d7 rk1 k )Pk1 k\uf0a2 (t)]\uf03d \uf0e5 [Pk k1 (t)(E \uf0d7 \uf0d1k1 )\uf064k\uf0a2k1 \uf02b Pk1 k\uf0a2 (t)(E \uf0d7 \uf0d1k1 )\uf064k k1 ] (1),\n\uf068 k1\n\uf068 k1\n\uf0b6t\nHere r is the radius vector, \uf068k is the momentum, q is the charge of particle. Other designations are\nstandard. The three-dimensional carrier momentum sum in Eq. (1) is explicitly evaluated analytically.\nSummation by part yields well known BE term\n\n\uf0b6n E (t )\nq\nq\n( E \uf0d7 \uf0d1 k \uf02b \uf0d1 k\uf0a2 ) P k k\uf0a2 , k\n\uf03d \uf02d ( E \uf0d7 \uf0d1 k ) n k , n k \uf03d P k k , (2)\n\uf0b6t\n\uf0b6t\n\uf068\n\uf068\nAnalogously BE scattering term can be easily derived in quantum theory [1-6]. But it is much more\ndifficult to take into consideration the dependence of distribution function on position of particles which can\nnot be considered in a plane-waves representation In order to develop kinetic theory with simultaneous\nlisting of coordinates and momenta one has to introduce Wigner representation [1-3, 6]. Wigner distribution\nfunction is derived from Greens function using the Wigner transform, which is Fourier transform, with\nrespect to the relative coordinate. This technique is useful in the systems that are not homogeneous. Wigner\ndistribution function is reduced to classic Boltzmann function in the limit where \uf068 tends to zero. But for\nmany Hamiltonians of interest Wigner distribution function is not positive definite and hence can not be\ninterpreted as a probability density. Here we develop quantum kinetic equation for microscopic polarization\nPk k \uf0a2 (t ) that allows be considered at k \uf03d k \uf0a2 as density of particles of inhomogeneous system described by\nnumbers of particles at quantized positions with quantized momenta\n\uf0b6 PkEk \uf0a2 ( t )\n\n\uf03d\uf02d\n\n\fIn many-particle physics it is customary to use the term quantum Boltzmann Equation (BE) referring\nto the classical BE with quantum scattering integral for carrier-carrier collisions [1-4]. Thus the Boltzmann\nequation looks formally very similar in the classic and quantum contexts. One would think that transport\ntheory has to be done within entirely quantum mechanical framework. But certain problems it is convenient\nto consider by means of distribution function n k describing the evolution of the density of particles in the\nclassical phase space. So the advantage of the BE method is that one can use it when the system is far from\nthe equilibrium. BE technique is also useful for study of systems that are not space homogeneous. This\narticle represents quantum BE in the form of difference equation, which can be used for investigation and\nnumerical simulation of quantum inhomogeneous systems.\n1. Plane-wavelets second quantization basis set.\nIn terms of creation a k\uf02b and destruction a k operators acting on Hilbert space the number of particles\n\nn k is determined as average n k \uf03d\uf03c a k\uf02b a k \uf03e . Here the k subscript represents the quantum numbers set of\nsingle particle states. Angular brackets mean quantum statistic averaging with making use of the\nnonequilibrium density matrix. The quantum system is characterized by a projection of the many-body state\non the complete set of eigenstates k of single particle Hamiltonian. In the plane-waves representation\n\n\uf07b \uf07d\n\nsingle particle state is specified by listing momentum and spin k \uf03d k , \uf073 . Uncertainty principle states that\n\n\uf044ri tends to infinity at \uf044k i \uf0ae 0 . There is no Hamiltonian which quantum numbers set is exactly\ndetermined by a simultaneous enumerating of classical momenta and coordinates. Fortunately, to construct\nHilbert space one only needs the complete set of functions. It is not necessary to use eigenstates of any\nHamiltonian. Thus we can use the set of wavelet functions X , K x of one-dimension system given by\n\n\uf07b\n\nX , K x \uf03d \uf059 X , K x ( x) \uf03d\nPlane wavelet function\n\n1\ndx\n\nexp\uf028iK x x \uf029 \uf071 \uf02b ( X \uf02b\n\n\uf07d\n\ndx\nd\n2\uf070\nn x , X \uf03d d x m x (3)\n\uf02d x )\uf071 \uf02d ( x \uf02d X \uf02b x ) , K x \uf03d\ndx\n2\n2\n\nX, Kx (3) is determined on the interval \uf05bx \uf02d d x / 2 , x \uf02b d x / 2) .

Here L x is the length of the material system in the x direction.\nAsymmetrical unit step functions \uf071 \uf02b ( x ),\uf071 \uf02d ( x) are defined as\n\n\uf071\n\n\uf02d\n\n\uf0ec 0, x\uf03c 0\n(x) \uf03d \uf0ed\n,\n\uf0ee 1, x \uf0b3 0\n\n\uf071\n\n\uf02b\n\n\uf0ec 0, x\uf0a3 0\n(x) \uf03d \uf0ed\n(4)\n\uf0ee 1, x \uf03e 0\n\nProduct of step functions \uf071 \uf02b\uf071 \uf02d in Eq.(1) is the well-known wavelet scaling function. In order to use\nunambiguously the set of ket vectors\n\n\uf07b X , K \uf07d as the basis of second quantization one has to show that this\nx\n\nset is complete.

Thus formally one has \uf064 ( x) \uf03d D( x, \uf0a5) / 2\uf070\n\non the interval ( \uf02d\uf070 , \uf070 ) . At\n\n\f1\nx \uf03d m\uf070 , m \uf03d 0,\uf0b11,\uf0b12,... \uf0b1 ( L x / d x \uf02d 1)\nthe\nkernel\nis\ndetermined\nby\nthe\nexpression\n2\nD (m\uf070 , Lx ) \uf03d \uf028L x / d x \uf02b 1\uf029 but the product of step functions \uf071 \uf02b ( x),\uf071 \uf02d ( x) in Eq. (6) is equal to zero at\n1\nm \uf03d \uf0b11,\uf0b12,... \uf0b1 ( Lx / d x \uf02d 1) .
