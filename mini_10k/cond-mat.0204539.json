These transitions occur at T = 0 when a parameter of the hamiltonian is\nvaried across a critical value and are driven by quantum fluctuations. Among them, those\nthat are due to the effect of disorder are more difficult to analyze both analytically and\nnumerically and have been the focus of much attention recently.\nIn this paper we consider the spin 1/2 XXZ chain in the presence of a non-symmetry\nbreaking random magnetic field. This system is particularly interesting since a renormalization group analysis [2, 3, 4] suggests the existence of a critical region in the space of\nparameters where the disorder is not relevant. This idea is also supported by numerical\ncalculations [5, 6]. In [5] the system was studied using an exact diagonalization method up\nto 16 sites. Although this size is enough to study the system far from the critical region,\nnear the transition, as it is explained there, the calculations were less reliable due to the\nsmall size of the chains considered. Larger chains can be handled using a density matrix\nrenormalization group (DMRG) algorithm [7] at the expense of truncating the Hilbert space\nof states. This method was used in [6] to obtain further information about the critical region\nby computing the phase sensitivity, which is the difference in energy between periodic and\nantiperiodic boundary conditions.\nIn this paper we use the DMRG method to compute the correlation length and the\nsuperfluid density which give direct information about the existence of a quasi-long-range\norder region since that region is defined as the one where the correlation length diverges and\nthe superfluid density is non-zero. In particular, to compute the superfluid density we used\na superblock configuration that allowed us to introduce an arbitrary twist at the boundary.\nSince we perform DMRG calculations, our results contain two approximations. The\nfirst is that we consider a finite chain and the second that we truncate the Hilbert space\n(keeping a finite number of density matrix eigenstates). These approximations are related\nsince with a truncated Hilbert space the correlation length is always finite and, in fact, the\nvalue corresponding to an infinite chain (what we are going to call the 'truncated system\ncorrelation length') becomes smaller as we reduce the Hilbert space. To minimize the finite\nsize effects in the calculation of the spin correlations, it is necessary to consider chains\nlarger than the truncated system correlation length. However, in the critical region this\ncorrelation length increases rapidly as we keep more DMRG states, therefore, reducing the\ntruncation error by keeping a large number of states soon becomes prohibitive since we\nneed to consider very long chains 1 . Thus, most of our calculations of the spin correlations\nare done keeping up to 32 states and give only an estimation to the shape of the critical\nregion. As we will discuss later, the main source of error in this estimation is the truncation\nof the Hilbert space. To further support these qualitative results, for the special case of\nanisotropy \u2206 = \u22120.75 and selected values of the random magnetic field, we keep up to\n96 states and extrapolate the computed correlation length to infinite number of sites and\ninfinite number of DMRG states. The extrapolations allow us to conclude the existence of\na quasi-long-range order region and put bounds on the maximum critical field.\nIn the calculations of the superfluid density we also keep up to 32 states in most of the\ncases and estimate the shape of the critical region using a criterion in which, again, the main\napproximation is the truncation of the Hilbert space. As we did for the correlations, for\n1\n\nFor a more quantitative statement see Fig. 16\n\n2\n\n\fthe special case of \u2206 = \u22120.75 and selected values of the random magnetic field we keep up\nto 128 states and extrapolate the superfluid density to infinite length and infinite number\nof DMRG states. We find an agreement between the correlation length and the superfluid\ndensity results.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we summarize the\nknown results for this system and in section 3 we describe the numerical method used. We\npresent and discuss the results in sections 4 and 5 and finally, in section 6 we give our\nconclusions.\n\n2\n\nThe spin 1/2 XXZ chain in a random z magnetic field\n\nIn this section we summarize previous results obtained for this system by C. Doty and D.\nFisher [4].\nIn the absence of disorder the spin 1/2 XXZ chain is defined by the Hamiltonian\nH0 =\n\nL\nX\n\ny\nx\nz\n(Six Si+1\n+ Siy Si+1\n+ \u2206Siz Si+1\n).\n\n(1)\n\ni=1\n\nWhen the anisotropy parameter, \u2206, satisfies \u22121 < \u2206 \u2264 1, the system is in a non-magnetic\ngapless phase where the spin-spin correlation functions in the ground state decay as a power\nlaw (quasi-long-range order (quasi-LRO) phase) [8, 9, 10]. On the other hand, the spectrum\nhas a gap for \u2206 > 1 (\u2206 \u2264 \u22121) and possesses a long-range Ising like antiferromagnetic\n(ferromagnetic) order.\nIn this work we study the effects produced by the addition of the following term:\nH1 =\n\nL\nX\n\nhzi Siz ,\n\n(2)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere hzi is a random magnetic field with an independent and uniform distribution in\neach site (hhzi i = 0, hhzi hzj i = \u03b4ij h20 /3). Note that the addition of this term does not break\nthe symmetry in the xy plane.\nThe main conclusion of [4] is that for \u22121 < \u2206 < \u22121/2 the quasi-long-range order that\nthe system possesses at hiz = 0 persists for finite values of the random magnetic field.\nTo reach this conclusion, the long-distance behavior of the system was analyzed by\nstudying the renormalization group flow. In the region |\u2206| < 1 one can perform a JordanWigner transformation to spinless fermionic variables. The component S z is converted into\nthe fermion occupation number and S \u00b1 are creation and annihilation operators:\nSnz = \u03a8\u2020n \u03a8n \u2212\nSn\u2212 = exp i\u03c0\n\n1\n,\n2\n\n(3)\n!\n\n1\nz\n(Sm\n+ ) \u03a8n .\n2\nm<n\nX\n\n(4)\n\nFor the pure XXZ chain when \u2206 = 0, the ground state is a half-filled band with Fermi\nmomenta kF = \u00b1\u03c0/2a where a is the lattice spacing. Low energy excitations around the\nFermi surface can be described in terms of bosonic fields using a standard procedure [11]:\n\u03a8n =\n\nr\n\ni\na h \u2212ikF x\u2212i\u03a6R (x)\ne\n+ eikF x+i\u03a6L (x) .\nL\n\n3\n\n(5)\n\n\fHere L is the length of the system. The bosonic fields \u03a6L,R describe left and right moving\nexcitations.\nThe random perturbation (2), can also be expressed in terms of the bosonic fields and,\nat low energies, the continuum limit can be taken which results in an action [2, 4]:\nS=\n\nZ\n\ndxd\u03c4\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n1\n\u03ba(\u2202\u03c4 \u03a6)2 + \u03ba(\u2202x \u03a6)2 + g cos(2\u03a6) + \u03b7(x)\u2202x \u03a6 + \u03c1(x)ei\u03a6 + \u03c1\u2217 (x)e\u2212i\u03a6\n2\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(6)\nfor the field \u03a6(x) = \u03a6R + \u03a6L . Besides, g is a function of the anisotropy \u2206, and \u03b7(x)\nand \u03c1(x) are composed of the Fourier components of the random field near zero and 2kF ,\nrespectively. Also, \u03ba is the spin stiffness of the ordered system given by the Bethe-ansatz\nsolution [12]:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\n(7)\n1 \u2212 cos\u22121 \u2206 .\n\u03ba=\n2\u03c0\n\u03c0\nAfterwards, the replica formalism can be used to compute disorder averages of ground-state\nexpectation values giving the effective action:\nSef f\n\n=\n\nn Z\nX\n\ndx d\u03c4\n\n\u03b1=1\n\n\u2212\n\nX\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\nD\n\nZ\n\n\u0014\n\n1\n1\n\u03ba(\u2202\u03c4 \u03a6\u03b1 )2 + \u03ba(\u2202x \u03a6\u03b1 )2 \u2212\n2\n2\n\u0015\n\ndx d\u03c4 d\u03c4 \u2032 cos[\u03a6\u03b1 (x, \u03c4 ) \u2212 \u03a6\u03b2 (x, \u03c4 \u2032 )],\n\n(8)\n\nwhere D =< (hzi )2 >= h20 /3. Thus, the disorder induces interactions between pairs of\nreplicas. The interaction comes from averaging over \u03c1, that is the term due to the staggered\ncomponent of the magnetic field. The term due to \u03b7 is irrelevant at large distances and is\nnot included in (8).\nUsing the fact that the dimension of the operator cos(\u03a6) is 1/4\u03c0\u03ba, the RG eigenvalue\n\u03bb, which determines the rescaling of D is given by [4]:\n\u03bb = 1 + 2z \u2212 2\u03b6,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere the dynamical exponent z = 1 and \u03b6 = 1/(4\u03c0\u03ba).\nThe sign of \u03bb determines the relevance of the randomness D. In the interval \u22121/2 <\n\u2206 \u2264 1, \u03bb is positive, indicating that the disorder is relevant and that the quasi-LRO is\nunstable under any small amount of randomness. On the other hand, \u03bb is negative in the\nregion \u22121 < \u2206 < \u22121/2, so there the disorder is irrelevant and the quasi-LRO is expected\nto persist for small values of D. Therefore, in the latter case, a quantum phase transition\nbetween a quasi-LRO phase and a localized disordered phase has to occur for finite D [4].\nBy means of a RG treatment for weak disorder [2] the RG equations governing the critical\nproperties can be obtained [4]. The flow lines in the \u03ba \u2212 D plane, near the point \u03ba = 1/6\u03c0\nare parabolas, (\u03ba \u2212 1/6\u03c0)2 \u2212 D = 0 being the critical one. The phase transition is of the\nKosterlitz-Thouless type [4] and the correlation length corresponding to the spin correlation\nfunctions diverges like:\np\n(10)\n\u03be \u223c exp(A/ \u2206 \u2212 \u2206c ),\nwhen the quasi-LRO phase is approached along a path in the phase diagram at fixed disorder.

Note that\nthe top of the region where the quasi-LRO persists i.e the maximum critical field is not\nestablished since the perturbative renormalization group result is valid only near \u2206 = \u22120.5.\nA numerical work analyzing this phase diagram was performed by Runge and Zimanyi\n[5]. They use an exact diagonalization procedure up to 16 sites and compute, among other\nthings, the superfluid density \u03c1s which measures the sensitivity of the system to changes in\nthe boundary conditions:\n1 \u22022E\n.\n(11)\n\u03c1s =\nL \u2202(\u2207\u03b8)2\nHere, \u03b8 is a twist introduced at the boundary by adding to the Hamiltonian (1) the term\n\u0011\n1 \u0010 + \u2212 i\u03b8\nS1 SL e + S1\u2212 SL+ e\u2212i\u03b8 + \u2206 S1z SLz .\n2\n\n(12)\n\nDoing this, the chain is closed in such a way that a boson acquires a phase ei\u03b8 (e\u2212i\u03b8 ) if it\nis hopping to the right (left) through the boundary.\nThis superfluid density is the order parameter of the transition (\u03c1s > 0 in the quasi-LRO\nphase and \u03c1s = 0 in the localized phase).\nIn [5], the authors find a qualitative agreement with the RG predictions [2, 4, 3]. However\nthey conclude that it is necessary to study larger chains to obtain more accurate results\nnear the critical region.\nIn this paper we compute the superfluid density and the correlation length using the\nDMRG approach which allows us to study longer chains. In that way we expect to obtain\nfurther evidence and complementary results.\n5\n\n\f3\n\nNumerical method\n\nWe compute the properties of the system using an infinite-size DMRG algorithm [7]. The\ndisorder is included by doing the calculations for a single configuration of the random field\nand then, averaging over many realizations. Since the ground-state is non-magnetic in the\nquasi-LRO regime for the pure system and is expected to be also non-magnetic in the whole\nrange of \u2206 when the disorder is turned on, we perform our calculations constrained to the\nHilbert subspace where the z-component of the total spin is zero. We have checked that\nthis approximation is justified after sufficient averaging is performed.\nWe calculate the spin correlations\nCj (r) = hS0x Srx + S0y Sry i,\n\n(13)\n\nusing open boundary conditions and the same superblock configuration B \u2022 \u2022B as in [14]\n(where B represents a block and \u2022 a single site). In (13), h. . .i denotes quantum expectation\nvalue in the ground state and j is a given realization of the random field. To avoid the\nboundary effects, we first grow the system until the length of each block is around 30 sites.\nAfter that we start to compute the correlations taking the spin operator S0+ corresponding\nto the left site added at that DMRG step. In the next iteration this operator is rotated\nand truncated using the eigenvectors of the density matrix and so it will correspond to the\nright-most site of the left block. Iterating this procedure for the same operator we obtain\nafter r DMRG steps an operator Sr+ associated to a site which is at a distance r from the\ncenter. Simultaneously, the correlation Cj (r) is computed at each of those DMRG steps as\nhS0\u2212 Sr+ +S0+ Sr\u2212 i. Using this standard procedure it is only necessary to store one spin matrix\n(Sr+ ). Afterwards, we average the logarithm of the correlation functions Cj (r) over disorder\nto obtain what is called the typical correlation [15]. Usually, more than 150 configurations\nof the random field are required.\nAt large distances Cj (r) should be exponential outside the critical region where the disorder is relevant (finite correlation length) and power law inside the critical region, where\nit is irrelevant (infinite correlation length). However, due to the truncation of the DMRG\nand the finite size effects, we also find an exponential behavior inside the critical region.\nThis fact makes possible to define a typical correlation length from the slopes of the curves\nln Cj (r) vs r and analyze its behavior in the phase diagram \u2206 \u2212 h0 . The correlation length\ncomputed in this way is of course approximated and consequently gives qualitative information about the phase diagram.\nIf chains of various length are considered and, if for each of them, various number of\nstates are kept, an extrapolation to infinite length and infinite number of DMRG states\ncan be performed to decrease the error. This is discussed in section 5 where we do the\nextrapolations for a few special points in the phase diagram.\nTo compute the superfluid density which is the order parameter of the transition between\nthe quasi-LRO and the localized states, we need to consider a closed system with twisted\nboundary conditions. Closed systems can also be treated with the density matrix algorithm\nas shown in [16]. In that work two superblock configurations were analyzed: B \u2022 B\u2022 and\nB \u2022 \u2022B. It was found that the first one is better since it has a smaller truncation error\n(because the two blocks are not connected directly), although larger than the error obtained\nwith open boundary conditions. In our case, we found the configuration B \u2022 \u2022B more\nconvenient to introduce twisted boundary conditions since the twist can be introduced\n6\n\n\f\u03b8\nN\n\nN\u22121\n\nFigure 2: Superblock configuration used for the calculation of the superfluid density. The\ntwist is introduced between the two single sites added at each step of the DMRG.\nbetween the two single sites that we add at each step of the procedure (in that case the\noperators S + and S \u2212 which appear in (12) are not truncated). On the other hand since we\nare also interested in minimizing the truncation error, for the actual calculation we chose\nthe configuration in Fig. 2 which combines the advantages of both. Note that the left and\nright blocks have different number of sites although the same number of states are kept on\nboth of them. This asymmetry implies that we have to compute two density matrices, one\nfor the left block and one for the right one. However this is necessary anyway since the\nreflection symmetry is already broken by the random magnetic field.\nTo approximate eq. (11) numerically, given a configuration of the random magnetic\nfield, we perform the DMRG procedure twice (with and without twist) and compute for\neach length L the finite difference\n\u03c1s (L) \u2243\n\n1 E(L\u2207\u03b8) \u2212 E(0)\n,\nL\n(\u2207\u03b8)2\n\n(14)\n\nwhere we used that the first derivative \u2202E/\u2202\u2207\u03b8 vanishes at \u2207\u03b8 = 0 due to the symmetry\nE(\u2207\u03b8) = E(\u2212\u2207\u03b8). Afterwards, we average this quantity over many configurations of the\nfield. The h larger the strength of the field the more configurations needed (in most of the\ncases more than 200 configurations were considered).\nTo test the convergence of the DMRG method we computed \u03c1s keeping different number\nof eigenstates of the density matrix. It was found that the DMRG procedure converges if\nwe keep \u2207\u03b8 constant i.e. the twist \u03b8 increases with the length of the chain. This is shown\nin Fig. 3, where \u03c1s vs. L for \u2206 = \u22120.75 is plotted for a random field h0 = 0.1 keeping up to\n128 eigenstates of the density matrix. Since we need L\u2207\u03b8 to be small, in the calculations\nwe took \u2207\u03b8 = 0.01 and grew the system up to 50 sites.\nWe also checked (see Fig. 4) that without disorder our numerical results for \u03c1s agree\nwith the exact solution\n\u03c0 sin \u03bc\n,\n(15)\n\u03c1s (\u2206, h0 = 0) =\n2\u03bc(\u03c0 \u2212 \u03bc)\nfound in [10].

Our numerical results for a chain of 50 sites keeping 32 eigenstates of the\ndensity matrix are compared to the exact solution found in [10].\n\n8\n\n\fFinally, since we are truncating the Hilbert space it is important to estimate how good\nthis approximation is. A standard measure of that is the truncation error defined as the sum\nof the eigenvalues of the density matrix that are discarded. Keeping up to 32 eigenstates\nof the density matrix we obtained a truncation error less than 10\u22127 for open boundary\nconditions (spin correlations) and less than 10\u22125 for twisted boundary conditions (superfluid\ndensity).\n\n4\n4.1\n\nResults\nhSix Sjx + Siy Sjy i correlation\n\nBefore summarizing the correlation functions results, let us discuss what should be the\nbehavior of the correlation length in a phase diagram like the one proposed in Fig. 1. As\nwe said before, in the localized phase it is possible to define a correlation length, i.e. the\ncorrelations functions display an exponential behavior at large distances. Instead, in the\nphase with quasi-LRO this is not possible because, since the region is critical, the correlation\nlength is infinite. This means that, if we were able to solve the problem exactly, we should\nobserve in a 3-dimensional plot of correlation length vs (\u2206,h0 ) that this quantity diverges\nwhen we approach the line that divides the two regimes. This is not the case when we\nconsider a finite chain and moreover when we truncate the Hilbert space. What we should\nobtain instead is that the correlation length has a peak located in a region that coincides\napproximately with the critical region. This peak should become sharper, higher and closer\nto the transition as we consider larger chains and keep more DMRG states.\nHaving this in mind, we computed the spin-spin correlations\nCt (L) = ln |hS0x SLx + S0y SLy i|,\n\n(16)\n\ntransverse to the random field for several points of the phase diagram \u2206 \u2212 h0 . Here, the\nbar indicates average over disorder.\nIn Fig. 5, Ct (L) is plotted for h0 = 0.3 and different values of \u2206. The linear behavior\nat large distances means the correlations decay exponentially.\nFrom the slope of these lines we estimate the typical correlation length \u03be and analyzing\nits behavior as a function of \u2206 and h0 we obtain the 3-dimensional plot shown in Fig. 6 for\n16 and 32 DMRG states. There, we can see that the correlation length not only increases\nwhen we approach the axis h0 = 0 (pure system) keeping \u2206 constant but also in a region\nwith finite disorder centralized in a negative value of \u2206 between \u22121 and \u22120.5. This is an\nindication of the presence of a critical region for finite disorder where the quasi-LRO found\nfor h0 = 0 persists.\nTo obtain an approximation to the shape of the critical region, we propose to analyze the\ncontour plot of the typical correlation length. Following the previous discussion, in the limit\nof infinite length and infinite number of DMRG states, the contour lines will concentrate\non the border of the critical region. If, for a given truncation, we use the input that the\ncritical region starts at \u2206 = \u22120.5, the choice of a contour line such that h0 \u2248 0 at \u2206 = \u22120.5\nwill give us qualitative information about the shape of the critical region. This choice will\nbe justified in the next section when we discuss the superfluid density results. Fig. 7 shows\nthe contour plot of the typical correlation length for 16 and 32 DMRG states.

We want to remark here that\nin Fig. 7, the contour lines used to estimate the boundary of the critical region correspond\nto values of \u03be smaller than 100 (see Fig 6) while the chains considered were larger than 200\nsites. Thus, the finite size effects are small and the main approximation is in the truncation\nof the Hilbert space.\n\n4.2\n\nSuperfluid density\n\nWe computed the superfluid density using (14) and performed afterwards the average over\ndisorder. In Fig. 8, we show \u03c1s vs L for different values of the strength of the random\nfield h0 and \u2206 = \u22120.75. As expected, for a fixed length of the chain, \u03c1s decreases with h0 .\nNote that we obtain non zero values of \u03c1s because we study finite systems. For the infinite\nsystem the superfluid density is different from zero only for (h0 = 0,|\u2206| < 1) and inside\nthe critical region, that is, where the correlation length diverges. For that reason \u03c1s can be\nused to study the phase diagram of Fig. 1.\nFirst we are going to check that the quasi-LRO region extends up to \u2206 = \u22120.5. This\npoint is characterized by the fact that there, the correlation length critical exponent diverges.\nIn the region \u22121/2 < \u2206 < 1 where the disorder is relevant, the dependence of the correlation\nlength with the disorder D = h20 /3 near the critical line corresponding to h0 = 0, should be\n\u03be \u223c D \u2212\u03c6s and according to the perturbative renormalization group results [4], the critical\nexponent \u03c6s diverges at \u2206 = \u22120.5 like\n\u03c6s =\n\n3 \u2212 (1 \u2212\n\n1\n\u03c0\n\n1\n.\narccos \u2206)\u22121\n\n(17)\n\nTo extract this exponent from our numerical data, we analyzed the derivative \u2202\u03c1s /\u2202D at\n10\n\n\f100\n\n\u03be 50\n\n0.25\n0.2\n\n0\n-1\n\n0.15\n-0.8\n-0.6\n\nh0\n\n0.1\n\n\u2206\n\n-0.4\n-0.20.05\n\n(a)\n\n150\n\n\u03be\n\n100\n50\n0\n\n0.2\n-1\n\nh0\n\n-0.8\n\n\u2206\n\n0.1\n-0.6\n-0.4\n\n(b)\nFigure 6: The dependence of the typical correlation length in the plane \u2206 \u2212 h0 . a) Keeping\n16 eigenstates of the density matrix. b) Keeping 32 eigenstates of the density matrix.\n\n11\n\n\f0.25\n\n0.2\n\n0.15\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n-1\n\n-0.8\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.4\n\n(a)\n0.3\n\n0.25\n\n0.2\n\n0.15\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n-1\n\n-0.8\n\n(b)\nFigure 7: The contour plot of the typical correlation length in the plane \u2206 \u2212 h0 . a) Keeping\n16 eigenstates of the density matrix. b) Keeping 32 eigenstates of the density matrix.\n\n12\n\n\f0.8\n\nh 0 =0\n\n0.6\n\n\u03c1s\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\nh 0 =0.7\n0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nL\nFigure 8: The dependence of the superfluid density with the number of sites for different\nvalues of the random field and \u2206 = \u22120.75. The statistical error originated in the random\naverage is, in all the cases, smaller than the size of the symbols.\nD = 0. Assuming that \u03c1s = \u03c1s (L/\u03be) for L \u226b 1 [5], the behavior of ln(\u2202\u03c1s /\u2202D|D=0 ) with\nln L should be linear with the slope corresponding to \u03c6\u22121\ns . In the inset of Fig. 9 we show\nthis linear behavior for different values of \u2206. The critical exponent extracted from our data\nand the analytical prediction (eq. 17) are shown in Fig. 9 where a good agreement can be\nobserved. This result is in line with the existence of a critical region for \u2206 < \u22120.5 where\nthe disorder is irrelevant and justify our choice made in the \u03be contour plots.\nFor a given truncation, the border of this region can be estimated studying the dependence of \u03c1s with the strength of the random field for different lengths of the chain, L.\nFigure 10 is a plot of \u03c1s vs h0 for \u2206 = \u22120.75 and different lengths. The exact solution\n(infinite length and infinite DMRG states) should show a discontinuity in a transition of\nthe Kosterlitz-Thouless type (\u03c1s (h0 < hcrit. ) > 0 and \u03c1s (h0 > hcrit. ) = 0).\nUsing this fact, an estimation of the critical field can be obtained analyzing the behavior\nof the function \u03b4\u03c1s (\u2206, h0 ) = \u03c1s (\u2206, h0 , L) \u2212 \u03c1s (\u2206, h0 , L\u2032 ) where L and L\u2032 are fixed and\nL, L\u2032 \u226b 1. This corresponds, in Fig. 10, to taking two of the curves and computing the\ndifference. If the two curves correspond to lengths that are L, L\u2032 \u226b 1, the difference between\nthem will start to increase considerably only when h0 > hcrit. . This criterion assumes that\nfor L \u226b 1 \u03c1s (L, \u03be) = \u03c1s (L/\u03be) and then, if the truncated system correlation length is much\nlarger than L, \u03c1s becomes almost independent on the length L. In this way, this estimation\nis affected mainly by the truncation of the DMRG method and then, we expect to have\n\u03b4\u03c1s almost constant in the region where the truncated system correlation length is much\nlarger than L = 50 (which is the maximum length considered in the superfluid density\ncalculations). In Fig. 11 we show \u03b4\u03c1s (\u2206, h0 ) vs. h0 (taking L = 30 and L\u2032 = 50) for\n\u2206 = \u22120.5 and \u2206 = \u22120.75.

We\nhave checked that this behavior is the same taking different values of L and L\u2032 .\nWe also analyzed \u03b4\u03c1s (\u2206, h0 ) for other anisotropy values. The results are shown in Fig.\n12. Remarkably, all the curves corresponding to values of \u2206 between \u22121 and \u22120.5 fall\nbetween those corresponding to \u2206 = \u22120.5 and \u2206 = \u22120.75 supporting the statement that\nthe maximum critical field occurs for \u2206 = \u22120.75. An estimation of the critical field is then\ngiven by the intersection of the curve with the h0 -axis. To obtain that intersection we use\nthe first two points which differ from zero by more than the statistical error. Also from the\nerror in these points we estimate the error in the critical field so computed.\nIn Fig. 13, we plot these values of the critical field in the phase diagram giving an\napproximation to the boundary of the critical region.\n\n5\n\nExtrapolations for \u2206 = \u22120.75\n\nIn this section we study the special case of \u2206 = \u22120.75 and perform the extrapolations to\ninfinite length and infinite number of DMRG states of the computed properties for selected\nvalues of the random magnetic field.\nFor the superfluid density \u03c1s , we considered two points on the phase diagram: (\u2206 =\n\u22120.75, h0 = 0.1) and (\u2206 = \u22120.75, h0 = 0.5). From the approximated phase diagram of\nFig. 13 we expect h0 = 0.1 to be inside the critical region and h0 = 0.5 to be outside.\nIn Fig. 14 we plot \u03c1s as a function of 1/L. At large L the two cases display opposite\nbehavior. For h0 = 0.1, \u03c1s increases as we keep more DMRG states whereas for h0 = 0.5,\nit decreases. This is already an indication that the point (\u2206 = \u22120.75, h0 = 0.1) is inside\nthe quasi-LRO region whereas the point (\u2206 = \u22120.75, h0 = 0.5) is outside.

The solid lines in Fig. 14 are the results of these fittings.\nFinally, the values of \u03c10 (s) vs. 1/s are plotted in Fig. 15. Again, we considered the\nexpression \u03c10 (s) = \u03c1\u221e + a/sb to fit the curves. For h0 = 0.1 the extrapolated value is\n\u03c1\u221e = 0.586 \u00b1 0.003, confirming that the point (\u2206 = \u22120.75, h0 = 0.1) is inside the critical\nregion whereas for h0 = 0.5 the best fit was obtained for \u03c1\u221e = 0, indicating the point\n(\u2206 = \u22120.75, h0 = 0.5) is in the localized phase as we expected from the previous analysis.\nWe proceeded in the same way with the correlation length. In Fig. 16 we plot the\ntypical correlation length \u03be as a function of 1/L for \u2206 = \u22120.75 and h0 = 0.1, h0 = 0.3 and\nh0 = 0.5. In the h0 = 0.1 case, the correlation length increases drastically as we keep more\nand more DMRG states. As more states are kept, the larger has to be the chain to reach the\nasymptotic value corresponding to the infinite system. Instead, for h0 = 0.3 and h0 = 0.5,\nthe behavior is different. Not only the asymptotic values for the correlation length are one\norder of magnitude smaller but also the curves become closer as we increase the number of\nDMRG states indicating that the correlation length is finite. As we did for the superfluid\ndensity, we found the asymptotic values \u03be0 (s) = \u03be(s, L \u2192 \u221e), fitting each curve in Fig. 16\nwith the expression \u03be(s, L) = \u03be0 (s) + \u03b1(s)/L\u03b2(s) . The lines in Fig. 16 are the results of\nthese fittings. The asymptotic values \u03be0 (s) = \u03be(s, L \u2192 \u221e) found in this way are plotted as\na function of 1/s in Fig. 17. In all the cases, the errors in the data are smaller than 1%\nand then, smaller than the size of the symbols.\nTo fit the curves in Fig. 17 we used again the expression \u03be0 (s) = \u03be\u221e + a/sb . For\nh0 = 0.1 the best fit was obtained for a negative exponent (b = \u22120.155) implying an infinite\ncorrelation length for infinite number of DMRG states. On the other hand, for h0 = 0.3\nand h0 = 0.5 we find b possitive and the extrapolated values for the correlation length are\n\u03be\u221e (h0 = 0.3) = 108 \u00b1 18, and \u03be\u221e (h0 = 0.5) = 26.45 \u00b1 2.95.\nIn summary, from the extrapolations performed for \u2206 = \u22120.75, we conclude the existence of a quasi-LRO and put bounds on the exact value of the critical field. This value\nshould be larger than h0 = 0.1 and smaller than h0 = 0.3.\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this work we analyzed numerically the quantum phase diagram of the spin 1/2 XXZ\nchain in a random magnetic field pointing in the z direction.\nThe two-point spin-spin correlation functions in the XY plane and the superfluid density were computed using an infinite-size density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)\nalgorithm.\nThe asymptotic exponential behavior of the spin correlations allowed us to extract the\ntypical correlation length and study its dependence with the anisotropy \u2206 and the strength\nof the random magnetic field h0 . The contour plots of the correlation length as a function\nof \u2206 and h0 give numerical evidence of the existence of a critical region for finite disorder\nand negative values of the anisotropy. In this region the correlation length increases as we\nkeep more states in the DMRG method. Using our data for \u03c1s we extracted the behavior of\nthe correlation length critical exponent. A good agreement with the analytical prediction\nwas found [4] supporting the idea that the critical region starts in \u2206 = \u22120.5. Then, an\napproximation to the boundary of the critical region can be obtained from the contour plots\nof the typical correlation length taking a contour line such that for \u2206 = \u22120.5 the value of\nthe field is h0 \u2243 0. In this way, we estimated hcrit. (\u2206 = \u22120.75) \u2243 0.20 for 32 states kept.\n17\n\n\f0.63\n0.62\n0.61\n\n\u03c1S\n\n0.6\n\n128 states\n64 states\n32 states\n16 states\n\n0.59\n0.58\n0.57\n0\n\n0.04\n\n0.08\n\n0.12\n\n0.16\n\n1/L\n(a)\n\n0.5\n\n\u03c1S\n\n0.4\n128 states\n64 states\n32 states\n16 states\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0.04\n\n0.08\n\n0.12\n\n0.16\n\n1/L\n(b)\nFigure 14: The Superfluid Density for \u2206 = \u22120.75 as a function of the inverse of the number\nof sites for different number of states kept in the DMRG. a) h0 = 0.1. b) h0 = 0.5.

The lines are the result of the fittings using the expression \u03c10 (s) = \u03c1\u221e + a/sb . For\nh0 = 0.1 the extrapolated value is \u03c1\u221e = 0.586 \u00b1 0.003, whereas for h0 = 0.5 the best fit was\nobtained for \u03c1\u221e = 0. The error bars were estimated from the statistical errors of the data.\nIn the h0 = 0.1 case they are smaller than the size of the symbols.\nFrom the analysis of the function \u03b4\u03c1s (\u2206, h0 ) = \u03c1s (\u2206, h0 , L) \u2212 \u03c1s (\u2206, h0 , L\u2032 ) for L, L\u2032 \u226b 1, we\nobtained an independent estimation of the critical field hcrit. (\u2206) for several values of \u2206 and\ndrew the corresponding points of the line that separates the quasi-LRO regime from the\nlocalized one. We found that the largest value of the critical field occurs at \u2206 = \u22120.75 and\nis approximately hcrit. (\u2206 = \u22120.75) = 0.25 for 32 states kept, in close agreement with the\nresults obtained from the correlation length analysis. Since these results are approximated\nand are mainly affected by the truncation of the Hilbert space, to further support them,\nwe extrapolated the typical correlation length and the superfluid density to infinite length\nand infinite number of DMRG states for the special case of anisotropy, \u2206 = \u22120.75, and\nselected values of the random magnetic field. The extrapolations allow us to conclude the\nexistence of a quasi-long-range order region and put bounds on the critical field. The range\nof possible values for the critical field (0.1 < hcrit. < 0.3) contains the approximated results\nbefore obtained.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to P. Henelius and M.
