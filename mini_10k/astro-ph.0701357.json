During inflation, quantum vacuum fluctuations in a light scalar\nfield are redshifted far outside the Hubble radius, imprinting an approximately scale-invariant spectrum of\nclassical density perturbations [3, 4]. Models that realize this scenario have been widely discussed [5, 6, 7].\nThe resulting perturbations give rise to galaxy formation and temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background, in excellent agreement with observation [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16].\nIf density perturbations do arise from inflation, they\nprovide a unique window on physics at otherwise inaccessible energy scales. In a typical inflationary model\n(although certainly not in all of them), the energy scale\nE = V 1/4 is related to the amplitude of density fluctua\u221a\ntions \u03b4 and the reduced Planck mass MP via E \u223c \u03b4MP .\nSince we observe \u03b4 \u223c 10\u22125 , it is very plausible that inflation occurs near the scale of grand unification, and not\ntoo far from scales where quantum gravity is relevant.\nSince direct experimental probes provide very few constraints on physics at such energies, it makes sense to\nbe open-minded about what might happen during the\ninflationary era.\nIn this paper we ask what happens when a cherished\nproperty of low-energy physics \u2013 rotational invariance \u2013\nis violated during inflation. Rotational invariance is of\ncourse a subset of Lorentz invariance, and theoretical\nmodels of Lorentz violation in the current universe (and\nexperimental constraints thereon) have been extensively\nstudied in recent years [17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. Here we are\nspecifically concerned with the possibility that rotational\ninvariance may have been broken during inflation by an\neffect that has subsequently disappeared, and study the\neffects of such breaking on CMB anisotropies. It is possible that such an effect has already been detected, in the\nform of the \"Axis of Evil,\" an apparent alignment of the\nCMB multipoles on very large scales [22, 23, 24, 25, 26,\n\n27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42].\nAlthough its statistical significance is hard to quantify, a\nvariety of models have been put forward to explain this\nphenomenon [43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52]. Our\naim is not to construct a model contrived to explain the\ncurrently observed large-scale anomalies, but rather to\nmake robust predictions for the observable consequences\nof a preferred direction during inflation, allowing observations to put constraints on its magnitude.\nThe power spectrum P (k) for the primordial density\nperturbations \u03b4(k) is defined by\nh\u03b4(k)\u03b4 \u2217 (q)i = P (k)\u03b4 3 (k \u2212 q).\n\n(1)\n\nThe Dirac delta function in Eq. (1) implies that modes\nwith different wavenumbers are uncoupled, and is a consequence of translational invariance during the inflationary era. On the other hand, the fact that the power\nspectrum P (k) only depends on the magnitude of the\nvector k is a consequence of rotational invariance. Suppose that during the inflationary era rotational invariance\nis broken by the presence of a small vector that points\nin the direction of a unit vector n. Assuming a parity\nk \u2192 \u2212k symmetry, the leading effect of the violation of\nrotational invariance changes the most general form of\nthe power spectrum from P (k) to P \u2032 (k), where\n\u0010\n\u0011\nP \u2032 (k) = P (k) 1 + g(k)(k\u0302 * n)2 .\n\n(2)\n\nHere k\u0302 is the unit vector along the direction of k and\nwe are neglecting higher powers of k\u0302 * n since they will\nbe suppressed by more powers of the magnitude of the\nsmall vector that breaks rotational invariance. (Effects\nof a timelike vector on inflationary perturbations have\nalso been studied [53].)\nTowards the end of the inflationary era, the physical\nwavelengths that correspond to scales of astrophysical\ninterest are large compared with the inverse Hubble constant during inflation or any of the dimensionful particlephysics quantities that might be relevant during inflation.\nThe same naturalness arguments that lead to the scaleinvariant Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum (i.e., primordial\n\n\f2\nP (k) \u221d 1/k 3 ) imply that g(k) in Eq. (2) should be independent of k. Assuming that g(k) is a k-independent\nconstant g\u2217 over the scales of astrophysical interest, we\narrive at\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(3)\nP \u2032 (k) = P (k) 1 + g\u2217 (k\u0302 * n)2 .\n\nThis is the form of the primordial power spectrum that\ntakes into account the leading effects of the violation of\nrotational invariance by a small vector in the inflationary\nera that points in the direction n. In the next section we\ndiscuss the implications of the power spectrum in Eqs. (2)\nand (3) for the anisotropy of the microwave background\nradiation. The breaking of rotational invariance gives rise\nto correlations between multipole moments that would\nnormally vanish and also alters the predictions for the\nusual multipole moment correlations. In section three\nwe discuss a simple model that realizes the form of the\nprimordial power spectrum in Eq. (3). Concluding remarks are given in section four.\nII.\n\nIt is useful to introduce the \"spherical\" components of\nthe unit vector n that defines the preferred direction for\nrotational non-invariance,\n\nn+ = \u2212\n\n\u0012\n\nnx \u2212 iny\n\u221a\n2\n\nThe anisotropy of the microwave background temperature T along the direction of the unit vector e is related\nto the primordial fluctuations by\nZ\nX \u0012 2l + 1 \u0013\n\u2206T\n(\u2212i)l Pl (k\u0302 * e)\u03b4(k)\u0398l (k),\n(e) = dk\nT\n4\u03c0\nl\n(5)\nwhere Pl is the Legendre polynomial of order l and \u0398l (k)\nis a function of the magnitude of the wave-vector k that\nincludes, for example, the effects of the transfer function.\nIt can only depend on the magnitude of the wave-vector\nsince the dynamics after the inflationary era is assumed\nto be rotationally invariant.\nWe would like to compute the expectation values\nhalm a\u2217l\u2032 m\u2032 i to first order in the small quantity g(k) that\ncharacterizes the primordial violation of rotational invariance. We write\nhalm a\u2217l\u2032 m\u2032 i = halm a\u2217l\u2032 m\u2032 i0 + \u2206(lm; l\u2032 m\u2032 ),\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the subscript 0 denotes the usual rotationally invariant piece,\nZ \u221e\nhalm a\u2217l\u2032 m\u2032 i0 = \u03b4ll\u2032 \u03b4mm\u2032\ndkk 2 P (k)\u0398l (k)2 .

Note that we do not assume\nthat the preferred direction n coincides with the \u1e91 axis\nof the coordinate system used to parameterize the microwave sky (i.e., that n+ = n\u2212 = 0).

(3) can arise in an explicit model of anisotropic inflation. We will assume that,\nduring most of the inflationary era, rotational invariance\nis broken by a spacelike four-vector u\u03bc with invariant\nlength\ng\u03bc\u03bd u\u03bc u\u03bd = m2 .\n\n(17)\n\nWe will consider the effect of the energy-momentum tensor associated with this vector on the expansion of the\nuniverse during inflation, ignoring direct couplings of\nu\u03bc to other fields. Gravitational effects of dynamical\nLorentz-violating vector fields have been considered previously in the literature [56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61].\nWe assume that the four-vector u\u03bc is non-zero only\nduring the time interval 0 < t < t\u2217 , where t\u2217 is the end\nof inflation, so that the dynamics is rotationally invariant\n\n\f4\nduring reheating and thereafter.

Quantum fluctuations in the massless scalar\nfield \u03c7 are assumed to dominate the density perturbations via the DGZK mechanism [55]. In that case we\nneed simply calculate the fluctuations in \u03c7, without worrying about the behavior of the inflationary potential.\nWe approximate the inflaton energy density as a constant, modeling the effects of the inflaton field by a vacuum energy \u03c1\u039b in Eq.

Our specific model violates these conditions. Nevertheless, for\n\u03b23 = \u2212\u03b21 and \u03b22 = 0 the kinetic term for fluctuations\nabout our background has the form of a field strength\ntensor squared and so is ghost free.

Combining this result\nwith a similar analysis for modes perpendicular to the \u1e91\ndirection reproduces the result in Eq.

However at time t = t\u2217 the coordinates in Eq. (21) do not exhibit manifest rotational invariance, due to the difference between a(t\u2217 ) and b(t\u2217 ).\nRescaling coordinates, z \u2192 z(\u0101(t\u2217 )/b(t\u2217 )) and x\u22a5 \u2192\nx\u22a5 (\u0101(t\u2217 )/a(t\u2217 )), we find that the function g(k) characterizing the rotationally non-invariant part of the power\nspectrum for the primordial density perturbations is\ng(k) =\n\n9\n\u01ebH (log(k/H\u0304) \u2212 N\u2217 )\n2\n9\n= \u01ebH log(q(t\u2217 )/H\u0304),\n2\n\n(45)\n\nwhere the term proportional to N\u2217 comes from the rescaling of coordinates and q(t\u2217 ) = k/\u0101(t\u2217 ) is the physical\nwavelength of the mode of interest at the end of inflation.\nThe logarithm in (45) is actually nearly constant over\nvalues of q(t\u2217 ) of astrophysical interest. The range of\nq(t\u2217 ) probed by CMB measurements is about a factor\nof 103 , so log(q(t\u2217 )/H\u0304) changes by roughly 7. But the\nmodes of cosmological interest cross the deSitter horizon around 60 e-foldings before the end of inflation. So\n| log(q(t\u2217 )/H\u0304)| is approximately 60. Hence, in this model\ng(k) varies by about 10% over the range of modes of\ncosmological interest and our general expectation that\nsetting g(k) = g\u2217 is a reasonable approximation has been\nconfirmed.\n\n\f6\nFor simplicity in this analysis we neglected terms that\ndirectly couple u\u03bc to \u03c7. For example we could have added\nthe term u\u03bc u\u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u03c7\u2202\u03bd \u03c7/M 2 to the Lagrange density. It is\neasy to see that this gives an additional scale invariant\ncontribution, 3m2 /M 2 , to g(k).\nIV.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nWe have investigated the possibility that rotational invariance may have been explicitly broken during inflation\nby an effect that has disappeared in the later universe.\nThe observed CMB temperature anisotropies provide a\ndirect window onto the physics of the inflationary era,\nand therefore offer a unique opportunity for constraining\n(and discovering) new phenomena at high scales. Our\naim has been to investigate the generic predictions we\nexpect from the presence of a preferred direction during\ninflation.\nIf rotational invariance is violated during inflation, it\nis natural for the effects of such a violation to show up\n\n[1] A.

Investigation of a simple model confirms the approximate\nscale-independence of this effect. The resulting expressions (10,12,13) can be directly compared with observations to probe the existence of small Lorentz-violating\neffects in the very early universe.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe are thankful for interesting discussions with\nJonathan R.
