The general aim is to understand how complex\nmacroscopic co-operation can emerge from the underlying\nmicroscopic laws that govern the behaviour of the individual agents. The minority game (MG) [1] is probably one\nof the most studied models in this context. It describes an\nensemble of traders who at each time step receive a piece\nof public information and react by either buying or selling.\nLearning from past experience, the aim of the individual\nagent is to be in the minority at each round of the game,\ni.e. to buy when most of the traders are selling and vice\nversa. To take their trading decisions the agents employ\nstrategies assigned randomly at the start of the game and\nthen kept fixed. These effectively act as look-up tables providing a map from the observed public information onto\na binary trading decision. At each time step the individual agent employs the strategy in his or her pool he or\nshe believes will maximise their potential payoff. In order\nto measure the performance of their strategies they allocate virtual points to each of their strategies, increasing\nthe score of strategies that would have yielded a correct\nminority decision.\nThanks to the simplicity of the microscopic equations\nof motion and because of analogies to models of spinglasses and neural networks, analytical progress can be\nmade using both static and dynamical methods of sta-\n\ntistical mechanics. It has been found that the relevant\ncontrol parameter for MGs is the ratio \u03b1 = P/N of the\nnumber P of possible values for the external information\nover the number of players N . A phase transition between\nan ergodic phase at high \u03b1 and non-ergodic states below a critical value \u03b1c has been identified and analytical\nexpressions for the macroscopic order parameters characterising the different states have been obtained [2,3,4,5,\n6,7]. While some order parameters in the ergodic phase\ncan be computed in the thermodynamic limit N \u2192 \u221e\nwithout making any approximations, the dynamics of the\ngame in its non-ergodic phase at low values of \u03b1 is not yet\nfully understood. Furthermore the calculation of a key observable of the MG, the magnitude of the overall market\nfluctuations or so-called volatility, is up to now restriced\nto approximations both in dynamical approaches and in\nstatic replica analyses [6,3].\nIn the original setup of the MG the strategies assigned\nto a given agent were completely uncorrelated and the\ninformation fed to the agents was based on the real history of the market dynamics [1,8]. Also, updates of the\nvirtual scores of the agents' strategies were performed\nafter each round of the game, and their relative success\nre-assessed before each trading decision, i.e. agents could\nswitch strategies between any two successive rounds of\nthe game. Such variants of the MG with score updates at\nevery round of the game are generally referred to as 'online' games. It was realised that no qualitative changes\nin the overall behaviour occured when the stream of information was replaced by random inputs at each time\n\n\f2\n\nTobias Galla\u2020\u2021k and David Sherrington\u2020: Strategy correlations and timing of adaptation in Minority Games\n\nstep [9]. Hereafter we shall therefore distinguish between\non-line games with 'real' or 'random' market history, respectively. It is technically much easier to deal with the\ncase of 'random' history so henceforth we concentrate on\nthis version (see however the recent work [10] for a generating functional analysis of MGs with real market histories). Early studies showed only slight differences between\non-line MGs with uncorrelated strategies and corresponding games in which the agents effectively sample a large\nset of information patterns before updating the scores of\ntheir strategies. This amounts to replacing the inflowing\ninformation by an averaging procedure over all possible\nvalues of the pieces of information to yield an effective\ninteraction between the agents; such models are known\nas 'batch' minority games. On the technical level, using\nthis effective interaction, the dynamics of batch MGs are\nmuch easier to study than their on-line counterparts, and\nhence most current dynamical studies are concerned with\nbatch versions of the MG [6,11,12,13,14,15]. Also, here\nwe restrict ourselves to the case of deterministic decision\nmaking; a stochastic extension is straightforward to consider [16], but complicates the detailed mathematics of the\nanalysis. Reviews on the MG can be found in [17,18]; note\nalso the recently published textbooks [19,20].\nIn this paper we extend the generating functional analysis of batch and on-line games with uncorrelated strategies as presented in [6,21] to the case of correlated and\nanti-correlated strategies. The purpose is twofold, firstly\nwe provide an analysis of the dynamics of such MGs with\nso-called 'diversified' strategies and complement the study\nof their statics previously presented by other authors in\n[2]. Secondly, we find that in the presence of anti-correlated\nstrategies significant differences in the global behaviour of\nbatch and on-line MGs are present, i.e. that the the overall\nperformance of the system strongly depends on the timing\nof adapation of the agents. This effect is small in the case\nof conventional MGs with uncorrelated strategies, but becomes magnified as the degree of anti-correlation in the\nstrategy assignments is increased. We also demonstrate\nthat some approximations which reproduce the the volatility of batch MGs with uncorrelated strategies with good\naccuracy, and are hence often considered to be standard,\nbecome inaccurate in games with highly anti-correlated\nstategies. We then discuss the effects of strategy correlations on the sensitivity to initial conditions and comment on the relation between the global oscillations and\nthe breakdown of ergodicity in batch and on-line MG with\ndifferent strategy correlations. As a by-product of the generating functional analysis of the dynamics of games with\ngeneral distributions of correlation parameters we finally\nstudy the case of bi-modal distributions, corresponding to\na mixed population of so-called 'speculators' and 'producers'\n\n2 Model Definitions\nThe MG describes the decision making dynamics of N\ninteracting agents, i = 1, . . . , N . At each round l of the\ngame all agents are given the same external information\n\nI(l) taken from a set of P elements. They utilise this information to determine an action by choosing from one of\na personal set of S strategies whose operation on the information yields a decision. Simulations have shown that\nrestriction to S = 2 strategies per agent yields characteristic behaviour. It also simplifies the analysis. Hence we restrict the further discussion here to this case. We also simplify the choices of the space of information and character\nof the decisions. Hence here we take each agent to hold\n1\nP\ntwo P -dimensional strategy vectors Ria = (Ria\n, . . . , Ria\n),\n\u03bc\na = \u00b11, with each component Ria chosen randomly from\nthe set {\u22121, 1} at the beginning of the game and thereafter fixed and the information to be given by an integer\n\u03bc(l) chosen randomly and independently at each step l\nfrom the set {1, . . . , P = \u03b1N }. Then the strategies act\nas look up tables for deciding 'trading' action, yielding\n\u03bc(l)\noutput Ria . If player i decides to use strategy a\u2217i (l) at\nround l of the game his or her trading action will be\n\u03bc(l)\nbi (t) = Ria\u2217 (l) . The re-scaled total bid at stage l is then\ni\nP\ndefined as A(l) = N \u22121/2 i bi (l). In order to decide which\nof their two strategies to use at any given time each players keeps a record of the relative performance of his or\nher strategies. A payoff value pia (l) is assigned to each\nstrategy and updated every M time steps according to\n\u0393\npia (l + M ) = pia (l) \u2212 \u221a\nN\n\nl+M\u22121\nX\n\n\u03bc(l\u2032 )\n\nRia\n\nA(l\u2032 ).\n\n(1)\n\nl\u2032 =l\n\nIn between the updates the scores pia are kept constant.\n\u0393 > 0 is a learning rate and of order O(N 0 ), introduced\nfor convenience [21]. Note that the minus sign in the update prescription ensures that strategies which predict\ncorrect minority decisions are rewarded. At each round\nplayer i then plays the strategy in his or her arsenal with\nthe highest relative score, i.e. a\u2217i (l) = sgn[qi (l)], where\nqi (l) = 12 (pi,1 (l)\u2212pi,\u22121 (l)) is the point difference of player\ni's strategies at time l. Upon introduction of \u03c9 i = (Ri,1 +\nRi,\u22121 )/2 and \u03bei = (Ri,1 \u2212 Ri,\u22121 )/2 the update rule (1)\ncan be compactified to\nl+M\u22121\nX \u03bc(l\u2032 )\n\u0393\n\u03bei\nqi (l + M ) = qi (l) \u2212 \u221a\nN l\u2032 =l\n\u001a\n\u0011\u001b\nX \u0010 \u03bc(l\u2032 )\n\u03bc(l\u2032 )\n.\n+ \u03bej sj (l\u2032 )\n\u03c9j\n\u00d7 N \u22121/2\n\n(2)\n\nj\n\nHere we have introduced the shorthand notation\nP si (l) =\nsgn[qi (l)], we will also abbreviate \u03a9 = N \u22121/2 j \u03c9 j . The\ncase M = 1 (where strategy scores are updated at every time step) is referred to as the on-line model. For\nM \u2265 O(\u03b1N ) one expects (and simulations confirm) the\nbehaviour of the system to be the same as that for the\nso-called batch version in which the sum over the actual values \u03bc(l\u2032 ) is replaced by an average over the set\n\u03bc \u2208 {1, . . . , \u03b1N }:\n\u03b1N\n\u0001\n\u0393 X \u03bc\b X \u03bc\n\u03c9j + \u03bej\u03bc sj (t) .

Allowing the correlation parameter \u03c1i to depend on i adds another layer of\nheterogeneity to the ensemble of agents: not only are their\nstrategies chosen at random and hence are heterogeneous\nacross the group of N players, but also the probability\ndistribution from which they are drawn may be different\nfor different agents. We will assume that each \u03c1i is randomly and independently drawn from a distribution P (\u03c1),\nso that, for example, P (\u03c1) = \u03b4(\u03c1\u2212 1/2) corresponds to the\nstandard game, with \u03c1i = 1/2 for all i. Some of our results\npresented below have been summarized in the short paper\n[22]. The statics of MGs with correlated strategies were\nfirst studied using replica methods in [2]. Numerical results are also found in [23], and in [24], where an effective\ncorrelation between the assigned strategies was introduced\n\u03bc\nupon biasing the {Ria\n} towards one of the binary entries.\nLet us finally, in this section, introduce the volatility,\n\u03c3 2 , of the market.

Such a game trivially leads to a\nvolatility \u03c3 2 = 1, corresponding to the random trading limit,\nand exhibits no phase transition.\n3\nA similar situation involving an ensemble of single agent\nprocesses has been encountered in [13], where the author discusses a population of agents trading with different frequencies.\n\nso that the different processes (13) (with different values\nof \u03c1) are effectively coupled through the matrices C and\nG, which appear in (13) and in the noise correlator (14)\nand which at the same time are (weighted) averages over\nthe whole ensemble of representative agent processes. The\noriginal N -agent dynamics and the self-consistent single\nagent problem are equivalent in the thermodynamic limit\nin the sense that disorder-averaged observables in the original problem (such as the correlation and response functions (11, 12)) are identical to the corresponding averages obtained from the ensemble of effective single-agent\nprocesses (Eqs. (16, 17) for the correlation and response\nfunctions). This equivalence extends to other macroscopic\nobservables, including the probability for a given agent to\n'freeze' (i.e. to use only one of his or her two strategies) in\n\n\fTobias Galla\u2020\u2021k and David Sherrington\u2020: Strategy correlations and timing of adaptation in Minority Games\n1\n\nthe long-run. We will use the resulting 'fraction of frozen'\nagents below in the further analysis of the effective agent\ndynamics.\nDue to the presence of the coloured noise {\u03b7\u03c1 (t)} and\nthe retarded self-interaction term in Eq. (13) a direct solution of the self-consistent problem defined by (13-17) is\nin general impossible beyond the first few time steps. An\nanalysis of possible ergodic time-translation invariant stationary states is however feasible, and will be presented below. Alternatively one can resort to a numerical iteration\nof the representative agent problem using a method first\nproposed in [25]. This effective Monte-Carlo integration\nof the single agent problem allows one to determine the\ncorrelation and response matrices C and G to arbitrary\nprecision without finite-size effects, but becomes more and\nmore costly computationally as the number of time steps t\nis increased (due to required inversions of matrices of size\nt \u00d7 t at time step t).\nThis direct-iteration procedure does not require any\nfurther assumptions on the properties of the dynamical\norder parameters, and can be carried out for all values of\n\u03b1 in both the ergodic and non-ergodic regimes of the game.\nIn Fig. 1 we display results for the volatility as a function\nof \u03b1 for unimodal distributions of the correlation parameter, \u03c1i = \u03c1 for all i. We find good agreement between\nthe data obtained from a direct simulation of the batch\nprocess (open symbols in Fig. 1) and from an iteration of\nthe effective single-agent process (solid markers), respectively. This confirms the validity of the analytical theory\nderived in this section for general P (\u03c1) in the special case\nof unimodal distributions of strategy correlations.\nWe will now proceed to analyse the single-effective\nagent process further and to compute persistent order parameters in the ergodic stationary state, as well as the\nphase diagrams of batch MGs with correlated strategies.\n\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n\u03c1=0.1\n\n\u03c1=0.3\n2\n\n2\n\n\u03c3\n\n\u03c3\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n10\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n10\n\u03b1\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n10\n\n\u03c1=0.7\n2\n\n0\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u03c3\n\n5\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\u03b1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n\u03c1=0.9\n\n0\n\n0\n2\n\n\u03c3 10\u22121\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n\n10\n\u03b1\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n\u03b1\n\nFig. 1.

This\nis the case if |\u03b7\u03c1 | < \u03b3\u03c1 , and then s\u03c1 = \u03b7\u03c1 /\u03b3\u03c1 .

(27)-(28) agree with the corresponding equations for\nthe static order parameters obtained within a replica symmetric theory [2]. They are easily solved numerically, and\nexact analytical predictions for c, \u03c6 and \u03c7 as functions of\n\u03b1 can be obtained for 0 \u2264 \u03c1 < 1. Results for the persistent correlation c are shown in Fig. 2, and we find very\ngood agreement with numerical simulations for large \u03b1,\ngreater than critical values \u03b1c (\u03c1). The deviations at lower\nvalues of \u03b1 = P/N < \u03b1c (\u03c1) are due to a breakdown of\nthe ergodic theory, more precisely of the assumption of\nfinite integrated response [6]. The point \u03b1c (\u03c1) at which\nthis happens can be computed from Eq. (28). One finds\nthat \u03c7 \u2192 \u221e at\u221a a critical value of \u03b1 = \u03b1c (\u03c1) given by\n\u03b1c (\u03c1) = erf(\u03bbc / 2), where \u03bbc = \u03bbc (\u03c1) fulfills\n\u0012\n\n7\n\n(30)\n\nSolving this equation numerically leads to the phase diagram depicted in Fig. 3, with the critical line in the (\u03b1, \u03c1)\nplane separating the ergodic phase (\u03c7 finite) and the nonergodic phase. This phase diagram for the MG with diversified strategies was first obtained from the corresponding\nreplica calculation in [2]. While macroscopic observables\nsuch as the volatility are sensitive to the initial conditions\nin the non-ergodic phase, \u03b1 < \u03b1c (\u03c1), the starting point is\nirrelevant in the ergodic phase, \u03b1 > \u03b1c (\u03c1). We display the\nvolatility for so-called tabula rasa starts (qi (0) = 0 for all\ni), and for randomly biased starts (|qi (0)| = q0 = O(1))\nin Fig. 1.\n4.2 Analytic approximations for the volatility\nAs we have seen it is possible to compute macroscopic order parameters of the stationary state, such as the fraction\n\nof frozen agents or the persistent part of the correlation\nfunction, exactly and in good agreement with simulations\nin the ergodic regime for general values of \u03c1. We will now\nturn to the magnitude of the market fluctuations \u03c3 2 . By\nperforming a direct average in the generating functional,\nit was shown in [6] that the disorder-averaged volatility\nmatrix \u039e is proportional to the correlator of the singleparticle noise in the effective agent process. Generalizing\nthe results of [6] to arbitrary values of \u03c1 we find the following exact result:\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u039e tt\u2032 = (1 \u2212 \u03c1)\u039btt\u2032 = (1 \u2212 \u03c1) (1I + G)\u22121 D(1I + GT )\u22121 tt\u2032 .\n(31)\nThus, an exact calculation of the volatility requires the\ncomputation of this matrix convolution, and hence the\nknowledge of both the long-term and transient behaviours\nof the dynamical order parameters G(\u03c4 ) and C(\u03c4 ) in the\nstationary state. To this end a full computation of the\ntime-translation invariant solutions of the self-consistent\nrepresentative agent problem would be necessary. Due to\nthe retarded self-interaction and the presence of the coloured\nsingle-particle noise, this is in general impossible. One\ntherefore has to resort to approximations, and the generally accepted approach first presented in [6] aims at expressing the market volatility in terms of the persistent\norder parameters c, \u03c6 and \u03c7.\nTo this end one separates the contribution of the frozen\nagents to the correlation function C from the contribution\nof the fickle agents and writes\nC(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) = \u03c6 + (1 \u2212 \u03c6) hs\u03c1 (t)s\u03c1 (t\u2032 )if i ,\n\n(32)\n\nwhere the average h. . .if i extends only over fickle agents.\nInserting this into P\n(31) and recalling\n\u03c3 2 = limT \u2192\u221e T \u22121 t\u2264T \u039e tt leads to\n\u03c1\n1\n1\u2212\u03c1 + \u03c6\n+ (1 \u2212 \u03c6)\n\u03c32 =\n1\u2212\u03c1\n(1 + \u03c7)2\n\uf8f92 +\n*\uf8ee\nX\nX\n\uf8f0\n\u00d7 lim \u03c4 \u22121\n(1I + G)\u22121\u2032 s\u03c1 (t\u2032 )\uf8fb (33)\n.\n\u03c4 \u2192\u221e\n\ntt\n\nt\u2264\u03c4\n\nt\u2032 \u2264t\n\nfi\n\n\f8\n\nTobias Galla\u2020\u2021k and David Sherrington\u2020: Strategy correlations and timing of adaptation in Minority Games\n\nIn [6], for \u03c1 = 1/2, the authors proceeded by keeping only\nthe instantaneous contribution, t = t\u2032 , in the last term.\nGeneralizing their calculation to arbitrary 0 \u2264 \u03c1 < 1 one\nobtains the following approximate expression\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03c1/(1 \u2212 \u03c1) + \u03c6\n+\n(1\n\u2212\n\u03c6)\n.\n(34)\n\u03c3 2 = (1 \u2212 \u03c1)\n(1 + \u03c7)2\nFig. 1 demonstrates that this approximation is in good\nagreement with data from simulations of the original batch\nprocess for \u03c1 & 1/2, but that it becomes less accurate as\n\u03c1 is reduced. In particular we note that in simulations we\nfind volatilities \u03c3 2 > 1 in the ergodic phase of batch games\nwith largely anti-correlated strategies, i.e. low values of \u03c1,\nwhile (34) predicts a volatility below the random trading limit \u03c3 2 = 1 for all values of \u03c1 and \u03b1 \u2265 \u03b1c (\u03c1). We\nhave verified explicitly that the discrepancy between this\nanalytical approximation and the numerically measured\nvolatility can be traced back to the omission of the noninstantaneous terms in (33): iterating the single-particle\nprocess using the Eissfeller-Opper algorithm [25], measuring the contributions from the frozen and fickle agents,\nrespectively, and taking into account all terms of (33) restores the agreement with direct numerical simulations of\nthe batch process. The discrepancy between the approximation of Eq. (34) and the volatility measured in simulations becomes extremal in the fully anti-correlated case.\nIn this case one finds no frozen agents, and inserting \u03c1 = 0\nand \u03c6 = 0 into (34) gives \u03c3 2 = 1 for \u03b1 > \u03b1c (\u03c1 = 0) = 1.\nIn numerical simulations of the batch process, however,\nwe find a decreasing relation \u03c3 2 = \u03c3 2 (\u03b1), and \u03c3 2 = 1 is\nonly approached in the limit \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e, see Fig. 4. In the\nnext section, we will study the case of fully anti-correlated\nstrategies in more detail, and will derive different analytical approximations for the global market fluctuations in\nthis case.\n4.3 The fully anti-correlated case\nIn the special case of completely anti-correlated strategies,\n\u03c1 = 0, and tabula rasa starts, we observe experimentally\nthat the system is always in a fully oscillating phase, i.e.\nthat all agents switch strategies at each time step, and that\naccordingly C(\u03c4 ) = (\u22121)\u03c4 for all \u03c4 . Eq. (27) for \u03c1 = 0 is\nindeed solved by c = 0 so that no frozen agents are possible. We will use this observation as an ansatz, which will\nallow us to proceed analytically and to give an approximate expression for the volatility, which is different from\nthe one (derived for general \u03c1) in the previous section.\nIts derivation is similar to the analysis of the non-ergodic\nstate in the limit \u03b1 \u2192 0 of the standard batch MG [6].\nIn this limit of the game with uncorrelated strategies a\nsimilar oscillatory state is found.\nFor \u03c1 = 0, we have D(\u03c4 ) = C(\u03c4 ) = (\u22121)\u03c4 and using Eq. (31), we conclude that the correlation matrix of\nthe single-particle noise in the stationary\nstate is given\nP\n\u2032\nby \u039btt\u2032 = (\u22121)t\u2212t \u03a5 2 , where \u03a5 = \u03c4 (\u22121)\u03c4 (1I + G)\u22121 (\u03c4 ).\nThus, for any fixed realization of the single-particle noise\n\u03b70 (t) must be of the form \u03b70 (t) = \u03a5 z(\u22121)t , where z is\n\n1\n\n10\n\n\u03c3\n\n2\n\n0\n\n10\n\n2\n\n\u03c3\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n1\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n\u03b1\n\n10\n\n\u03b1\n\n1\n\n10\n\nFig. 4.

This is illustrated in Fig. 5, where we plot c1 as\na function of \u03b1 for different values of \u03c1; (ii) the volatility\nplotted as a function of \u03b1 exhibits a minimum at \u03b1c (\u03c1)\nfor all 0 < \u03c1 < 1, but is decreasing monotonically for\n\u03c1 = 0, see the inset of Fig. 4. Nevertheless the stationary volatility in the fully anti-correlated case does depend\non initial conditions below \u03b1c (\u03c1 = 0) = 1, whereas the\nstarting point is irrelevant for \u03b1 > 1.\n\n4.4 Comparison with the on-line game\nWe will now turn to the case of on-line learning rules, and\nwill discuss the influence of the timing of adaptation of the\nagents on the behaviour of MGs with correlated strategies.\n5\n\nBelow \u03b1c we find C(\u03c4 ) = c0 + c1 (\u22121)\u03c4 for \u03c4 > 0 within the\nexperimental accuracy and with positive fitting parameters c0\nand c1 .

Circles: tabula rasa start (qi (0) = 0), squares:\nbiased starts (|qi (0)| = 3).\n\nA generating functional theory for the on-line game\nwith random external information and uncorrelated strategies has been worked out in [21]. The analysis has to deal\nwith the explicit dependence on the external information,\nand inevitably requires a much more elaborate mathematical formalism than the analysis of the batch game. The\nresulting theory is easily adapted to the case of general\nstrategy assignments with arbitrary correlations. We will\nnot report the mathematical details of the calculation, but\nwill only state that, in the ergodic regime, it leads to selfconsistent equations for the persistent order parameters\n(such as c, \u03c6 and \u03c7), which are identical to the ones of the\nbatch MG with general strategy correlations. As a consequence, the location of the phase transition (marked by\nan onset of diverging integrated response) is identical in\nbatch and on-line games with the same distribution P (\u03c1)\nof correlation parameters. Results for the persistent correlation c as a function of \u03b1 are compared with simulations\nof the on-line game with unimodular strategy correlations\nin Fig. 6. The on-line simulations shown in Fig. 6 essentially also match those of the batch case shown in Fig. 2\nfor the ergodic region.\nNumerical simulations, however, reveal crucial differences between the volatilities of the on-line and batch\ngames with correlated strategies. A comparison of Figs.\n1 and 7 shows that in their ergodic states the volatility\nof batch games can take values both above and below the\nrandom trading limit \u03c3 2 = 1 , whereas that in on-line\ngames never exceeds \u03c3 2 = 1.

All\ndata is from simulations with N = 300 agents averaged over\n10 samples of the disorder.\n\nvolatilites of batch and on-line games becomes maximally\npronounced in the fully anti-correlated case, compare Figs.\n4 and 8. In the on-line game with \u03c1 = 0 we find that the\nvolatility is equal to one for all \u03b1 > \u03b1c (\u03c1 = 0) = 1, whereas\nit approaches this random trading limit only asymptotically for \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e in the batch case. Allowing the agents\nto switch stategies only every M time steps according to\nthe update rule (2) one can interpolate between the batch\nand on-line cases6 : Fig. 9 shows the volatility \u03c3 2 as a function of \u03b1 for the fully anti-correlated case for different intermediate choices of M . While small values of M \u226a P\nproduce market fluctuations close to those of the on-line\ngame (which corresponds to M = 1), the batch limit is\nobtained for M \u2265 O(P ).\nSimilarly to the batch case, a computation of the transient parts of the dynamical order parameters would be\nnecessary to obtain exact expressions for the volatility\nof on-line MGs. As this is in general not feasible, one\nproceeds as in the batch case, and tries to find approximate expressions in terms of the persistent order parameters only. Such an approach was first proposed for on-line\ngames in [21], and is slightly different from the approximations in the batch case. The approximation is based on the\nobservation that in mean-field disordered systems with detailed balance fluctuation-dissipation relations can be used\nto 'transform away' non-persistent parts of the response\nand correlation functions without changing averages of\nsingle-time observables and averages of two-time quantities at infinite time-separations. For equilibrium systems\nwith detailed balance this approach is exact [27]. It can be\nused to extract the static order parameters as obtained in\na replica-symmetric equilibrium approach from the generating functional equations. Details of this procedure can\nbe found in [27,28].\nAlthough the MG does not exhibit detailed balance a\nsimilar ad-hoc procedure for removing the non-persistent\nparts of the order parameters has been successfully em6\nNote also that some work on mixed populations of agents\nwith individual updating frequencies Mi is currently being finalised by other authors [29].\n\n\fTobias Galla\u2020\u2021k and David Sherrington\u2020: Strategy correlations and timing of adaptation in Minority Games\n1\n\n10\n\n\u03c3\n\nbatch\non\u2212line\nM=0.1P\nM=0.5P\nM=P\nM=2P\nM=5P\nM=10P\nM=100P\n\n2\n\n0\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u03b1\n\n1\n\n10\n\nFig. 9.

The lines connecting the markers are\nguides to the eye.\n\n11\n\nversified strategies [2]. We note that the analogue of the\nremoval of the non-persistent parts of C and G in the\ndynamical approach is reflected by an assumption on the\ncross-correlations between the agents in the replica formalism of [2]. Based on the assumption that hsi sj i =\nhsi i hsP\nj i forPi 6= j the authors of [2] neglect a term \u2206 \u2261\nN \u22121 i6=j \u03bc \u03bei\u03bc \u03bej\u03bc (hsi sj i\u2212hsi i hsj i), in the ergodic phase\n(\u03b1 > \u03b1c ). Here again si (t) = sgn[qi (t)], and h. . .i denotes\nan average over time. While our findings concerning the\nvolatility suggest that this assumption is appropriate in\nthe on-line game, it appears to be inaccurate in the batch\ngame at low values of \u03c1. We have confirmed this numerically in simulations of the batch MG. At fixed \u03b1 > 1 we\nfind that \u2206 = \u2206(\u03b1, \u03c1) is close to zero for large values of\n\u03c1 \u2243 1, but increases as \u03c1 approaches zero. While we do\nnot depict these results here, we will only point out that\nfor \u03c1 = 0 we find oscillatory behaviour, si (t) = si (0)(\u22121)t ,\nat all \u03b1, so that hsi i = 0, but hsi sj i = \u00b11. One then has\nhsi sj i \u2212 hsi i hsj i = \u00b11 6= 0 so that the above approximation fails.\nTo conclude the discussion of the volatility in on-line\nmodels, we would like to mention that the volatility of\nMGs with real histories and fully anti-correlated strategies\nbehaves qualitatively like the one of the on-line MG with\nrandom history, with \u03c3 2 = 1 for \u03b1 > 1 [30].\n\nployed to obtain approximations for the volatility in [21].\nIt amounts to assuming that C and G are of the following\nform:\n\nFinally, in this section, let us briefly address the role\nof global oscillations in on-line MGs.

In [26] the authors considered an on-line version of the MG in which the agents\nproximate expression for the volatility\nuse only the sign of the total bid to update their strategy\n\u0015\n\u0014\nscores, i.e. a model, in which A(l\u2032 ) in Eq.

The\nwhich differs only slightly from the approximate result for authors then consider a conditional correlation function\nthe batch game, Eq. (34).

In\nparticular the behaviour of the on-line game with anticorrelated strategies appears crucially different from its\nbatch counterpart in this respect: in the batch game with\nanti-correlated strategies we find oscillatory behaviour for\nall values of \u03b1, whereas in the on-line case with real histories and sign-updates, they are found only in the low-\u03b1\nphase.\nBefore turning to the next section, we would like to\nremark that the oscillations below \u03b1c , first reported in [26],\nare generally not detected very easily in on-line games:\nwe have tested several other variations of the model and\nobservables and found that no oscillatory behaviour can be\nobserved if (i) the linear update (1) is used instead of the\nsign-update prescription, (ii) if unconditional correlation\nfunctions are considered instead of conditional ones or if\n(iii) real market histories are replaced by fake histories.\nWhile no persistent oscillations are found in unconditional correlation functions of on-line games with random\n\n\u03b1\n\n10\n\n0\n\nFig. 11.

Stars are the data for randomized updating (\u03c1 = 0, M =\n10P , see Fig. 12 for simulation details). No oscillations are\nfound in this case.\n\nhistories, oscillations emerge gradually for \u03b1 < \u03b1c (\u03c1 =\n0.5) in the case of uncorrelated strategies, and for all \u03b1 in\nthe anti-correlated case, as the time lag M between two\nsuccessive strategy updates is increased to approach the\nbatch limit, see Fig. 11 (oscillation amplitude for on-line\ngames is not shown, but is indistinguishable from zero on\nthe scale of Fig. 11).\n\n4.5 Random timing of adaptation\n\nFinally we have performed numerical simulations on MGs\nwith asynchronous, random timing of adaptation. Choosing M \u2265 O(P ) and allowing all agents independently and\nrandomly with probability 1/M to update their strategy\npreferences at a given on-line step, while still updating\ntheir score difference at each step, generates a batch-like\nmodel with asynchronous updating. As depicted in Fig.\n11 the randomization of the updates removes the oscillations in the spin-spin correlation functions of the batch\ngame. The corresponding volatilities are virtually identical to those of the corresponding on-line games above \u03b1c ,\nin particular we find \u03c3 2 = 1 for \u03b1 > 1 in the game with\nrandom updating and full anti-correlation, see Fig. 12.

While the previous section dealt only with\nthe case of unimodular distributions, we will now use the\nabove formalism to study a mixed population of 'speculators' and 'producers' [2]. While a speculator is defined as\na normal agent (holding two strategies), a producer is an\nagent with limited choice and has only one single strategy\nat his or her disposal (or equivalently two identical strategies, corresponding to full correlation, \u03c1 = 1). A detailed\nanalysis of the statics of games with such mixed populations is contained in [2]. In this final section before our\nconclusions we will complement this work by a study of\nthe dynamics of such models, and will demonstrate that\nthe dynamical theory reproduces the results of the static\nreplica analysis. The interplay of producers and speculators is also discussed in a different context in [31], where\nso-called grand-canonical MGs are considered7 ; see also\n[20] for further details.\nWe will consider an ensemble of N agents, consisting of\n(1 \u2212 x)N speculators (with correlation 0 \u2264 \u03c1 < 1 between\ntheir strategies) and xN producers, where 0 \u2264 x < 1.

As before,\nthe parameter \u03b1 = P/N is defined as the ratio between\nthe number of patterns and the total number of agents.\nUsing Eqs.

We have checked and confirmed these analytical\nresults for c against simulations for some choices of the\nmodel parameters, but do not report the numerical data\nhere.

The resulting phase diagram is depicted in\nFig. 13. The above equations obtained from the generating\nfunctional analysis agree with the corresponding results\nfrom the replica calculation, as presented in [2]8 .\nFinally the generating functional approach allows one\nto study the influence of decision noise on the phase diagram and behaviour of MGs [16]. A corresponding calculation for mixed populations of producers and speculators\nshows that multiplicative noise generally reduces the value\nof \u03b1c /(1 \u2212 x), i.e. that the range of the ergodic phase is\nincreased when the trading decisions of the producers are\nmade stochastically to a certain degree [34]. This shift of\n\u03b1c /(1 \u2212 x) becomes more pronounced as the noise level\nis increased. A similar effect was previously also observed\nin MGs in which the agents trade on different time scales\n[13].\n\n6 Concluding remarks\nWe have presented an analysis of the dynamics of minority\ngames with diversified strategies. Generating functional\ntechniques can be used to turn the coupled dynamics of\nN interacting agents with heterogeneous strategy correlations into an effective single-particle problem. The general case of heterogeneous correlation parameters \u03c1i of the\npopulation of agents (drawn from a distribution P (\u03c1)) is\nreflected in the fact that one finds an ensemble of single\nagent processes as the final outcome of the theory, as opposed to just one effective single-agent process for the case\nof uniform correlation parameter (\u03c1i = \u03c1 for all i).\nIn section 5 of this paper we have used the developed\nformalism to study mixed populations of 'speculators' and\n'producers'. The dynamical approach leads to order parameter equations which are identical to those obtained\npreviously from replica analyses of such models, and accordingly the phase diagrams obtained from the statics\nand dynamics coincide. In general one finds that adding\nproducers to the MG increases the range of the ergodic\nphase of the game.\nThe main focus of our study, however, has been the further analysis of the dynamical effective single-agent problem for the cases of batch and on-line games with unimodal\n8\n\nNote, however, that the conventions used in [2] are slightly\ndifferent, there an ensemble of N speculators and \u03c1N producers\nis considered (to make is (1 + \u03c1)N agents in total), and \u03b1 is\ndefined as the ratio between the number of patterns P and the\nnumber of speculators, \u03b1 = P/N .\n\n\f14\n\nTobias Galla\u2020\u2021k and David Sherrington\u2020: Strategy correlations and timing of adaptation in Minority Games\n\n9\n10\n\n0\n\n1/[(1\u2212\u03c1)(1\u2212x)]\n\n\u03c3\n\n2\n\n\u22121\n\n10 1\n10\n\n\u03c3\n\n2\n\n7\n5\n3\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u03b1\n\n10\n\n1\n\nFig. 12.

All data is from simulations\nat P = 50, the top most curves (circles) are for M = 1 (corresponding to the on-line game), squares M = 0.1P , diamonds\nM = P , triangles M = 10P . Simulations are started from\ntabula rasa initial conditions and run for 200M on-line steps\n(2000M steps for M = 0.1P ), all data is averaged over at least\n10 realisations of the disorder. The horizontal lines mark the\nrandom trading limit, \u03c3 2 = 1, in both panels [33].\n\ndistributions of the strategy correlations, along with numerical simulations and complementing the analysis of the\nstatics of such games previously presented in [2].\nWe find that the model with uniform, but general correlation parameter \u03c1 exhibits intriguing features, with similarities, as well as crucial differences, compared to the\ngame with uncorrelated strategies (\u03c1 = 1/2).\nThe main common features of the games with general correlation parameter are (a) the existence of two\ndistinct phases in both the on-line and batch games for all\n0 \u2264 \u03c1 < 1, with an ergodic state for \u03b1 > \u03b1c (\u03c1), in which\nno dependence on initial conditions is found, and a nonergodic phase below \u03b1c (\u03c1), in which the nature of the stationary state depends on the configuration from which the\ndynamics is started; (b) persistent oscillations are present\nin the non-ergodic phases of both the batch and the on-line\ngames for all \u03c1. Above \u03b1c (\u03c1), oscillations are absent in online games with arbitrary correlation parameter 0 \u2264 \u03c1 < 1,\nand in batch games as long as \u03c1 > 0; (c) for 0 < \u03c1 < 1\nthe transition point between the two phases is marked by\na minimum of the volatility \u03c3 2 = \u03c3 2 (\u03b1) in both the batch\nand on-line games; (d) we find analytically that the persistent order parameters in the stationary ergodic state and\nthe phase diagram do not depend on the details of the\nupdate rules (batch versus on-line learning) and that they\nagree with those calculated within the replica symmetric\napproximation; (e) no oscillations are found in simulations\nof games with random asynchronous updating (for neither\nuncorrelated nor anti-correlated strategies), while at the\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n0.6\n\u03b1/(1\u2212x)\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nFig. 13. Phase diagram of the batch MG with a mixed\npopulation of speculators and producers. The line in the\n(\u03b1/(1 \u2212 x), 1/[(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 \u03c1)])-plane is given by (52). The cross\nmarks the location of the phase transition in the standard game\n(q = 0, \u03c1 = 0.5).\n\nsame time a reduction of the volatility in the non-ergodic\nphases of such games is observed.\nHowever, the study of games with differently correlated strategies and different timings of adaptation also reveals some new features and striking differences between\non-line and batch games, which up to now have not been\ndiscussed systematically in the literature. These new issues may be summarised as follows: (i) the dynamics of\nthe batch game with fully anti-correlated strategies, \u03c1 = 0,\nappears different from the batch games with 0 < \u03c1 < 1\nand from the on-line game with \u03c1 = 0, as in the batch\ngame at \u03c1 = 0 oscillations of the form C(\u03c4 ) = (\u22121)\u03c4 are\nfound for all \u03b1 and not only in the low-\u03b1 phase; for tabula rasa initial conditions the volatility \u03c3 2 of the batch\ngame is a smooth function of \u03b1 without any minima or\nturning points. Nevertheless we find that the game with\nfully anti-correlated strategies is in a non-ergodic state\nfor \u03b1 < \u03b1c (\u03c1 = 0) = 1 for both batch and on-line learning rules, with the usual dependence of macroscopic order\nparameters on initial conditions in this regime; (ii) the\nvolatilities in batch and on-line games deviate increasingly\nfrom each other as the correlation parameter \u03c1 is lowered;\nby allowing the agents to update their strategy preferences\nsynchronously only once every M steps it is possible to interpolate smoothly between the on-line and batch limits,\nM = 1 and M \u2265 O(\u03b1N ), respectively; (iii) the available\napproximations for the volatilities of batch MGs, neglecting the retarded self-interaction of fickle agents, become\nunreliable in this regime of anti-correlated strategy assigments. Thus, care has to be taken whenever these approximations are applied to other extensions of the conventional\nbatch MG. The corresponding approximations in the online case, based on discarding transient contributions to\nthe response and correlation functions, however, appear\nto be valid above \u03b1c (\u03c1) for all values of \u03c1, even in the case\nof full anti-correlation.\n\n\fTobias Galla\u2020\u2021k and David Sherrington\u2020: Strategy correlations and timing of adaptation in Minority Games\n\nAcknowledgements\n\n15\n\n28.
