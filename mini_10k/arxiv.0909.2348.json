[1] it was shown that light neutralinos with a mass in the range 7 GeV\n. m\u03c7 . 50 GeV are interesting candidates for particle dark matter, with direct detection\nrates accessible to experiments with large exposure (of order 100 000 kg day) and low\nenergy threshold (of a few keV). This population of light neutralinos arises in the Minimal\nSupersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM) when the unification of gaugino\nmasses at a Grand Unified (GUT) scale is not assumed [2]. Indeed, in this supersymmetric\nframework the lower bound of \u223c 7 GeV on the neutralino mass is set by a cosmological\nbound on the neutralino relic density [1]. This is at variance with the lower bound m\u03c7 &\n50 GeV, which is derived from the LEP lower limit on the chargino mass within the MSSM\nwith gaugino mass unification at the GUT scale.\nA direct comparison of the theoretical predictions of Ref. [1] with experimental data was\nmade possible when the DAMA Collaboration published the results of its measurements\ncollected with a NaI detector of 100 kg over 7 annual cycles [3]. Actually, in Ref. [4] it was\nproved that the population of light neutralinos fitted well these DAMA results.\nThe inclusion of the channeling effect in the experimental analysis [5] and the further\nresults of the DAMA/LIBRA combined data [6] confirmed the good agreement of the\npredictions of Ref. [1] with the experimental data, as discussed in Refs. [7, 8].\nPossible indirect effects of light neutralinos were studied in Refs. [8, 9], where it was\nshown that present cosmic antiproton data set sizable constraints on the supersymmetric\nspace; measurements of cosmic antideuterons [10] with forthcoming airborne experiments\n[11] were indicated in [8, 9] as a very promising investigation mean for the light neutralino\npopulation.\nIn Ref. [9] also possible signals induced in neutrino telescopes by the neutrinos produced\nby pair-annihilations of light neutralinos captured in the Earth and the Sun were discussed.\nThe analysis was carried out in the case of a single category of events, those due to upward\nthrough-going muons.\nIn the present paper we resume the analysis of Ref. [9], by implementing and extending\nit in various distinctive features: a) the particle-physics uncertainties in hadronic quantities which affect the capture rate of relic neutralinos by the celestial bodies are taken\ninto account and discussed in detail; b) all main processes that occur during the neutrino\npropagation: neutrino oscillations and neutrino incoherent interactions with matter are\nincluded; c) the investigation comprises also the category of upward stopping muons (actually, this turns out to be the most promising case for upward-going muons induced by\npair annihilation of light neutralinos).\nIndirect evidence of WIMPs in our halo by measurements of upward-going muons at\nneutrino telescopes, generated by WIMP pair-annihilation in celestial bodies, has been the\nsubject of many investigations in the past, see for instance [12, 13, 14, 15].\nRecently, a number of papers appeared where possible signals at neutrino telescopes\ndue to pair annihilation of light DM particles are discussed. These consider either generic\nWIMPs with assumed dominance of specific annihilation channels [16, 17] or discuss specific\nDM candidates other than neutralinos: WIMPless dark matter and mirror dark matter\n2\n\n\f[17], leptonically interacting dark matter [18] and DM particles which directly annihilate\nto neutrinos [19]. All these investigations are restricted to signals from the Sun.\nAt variance with these analyses, the present paper deals with neutrino signals produced\nin cosmic macroscopic bodies by pair annihilation of light neutralinos whose specific supersymmetric properties are those which satisfy all existing particle-physics and cosmological\nconstraints, as analyzed in Refs. [1, 8]. Furthermore, our investigation entails neutrino\nsignals expected from the Sun as well as those from the Earth.\nOur results are given first for the whole population of light neutralinos, then for those\nsubsets which are selected by the DAMA/LIBRA results [6], when these are interpreted\nin terms of relic neutralinos. We separate the case where the channeling effect is included\nfrom the one where this effect is neglected.\nThe scheme of the present paper is the following. In Sect. 2 the main features of the\nsupersymmetric model employed here are summarized. The formulae providing the capture\nrates of relic neutralinos by celestial bodies and the annihilation rates due to neutralino\npair-annihilation are recalled in Sect. 3, together with some properties of the hadronic\nquantities which enter in the evaluations of the neutralino-nucleon cross section. The\ngeneration and the propagation of the neutrino fluxes is described in Sect. 4, their ensuing\nmuon fluxes are derived in Sect. 5. Results and conclusions are given in Sect. 6.\n\n2\n\nTheoretical model\n\nThe supersymmetric scheme we employ in the present paper is the one described in Refs. [1,\n8]: an effective MSSM scheme (effMSSM) at the electroweak scale, with the following\nindependent parameters: M1 , M2 , \u03bc, tan \u03b2, mA , mq\u0303 , ml\u0303 and A. Notations are as follows:\nM1 and M2 are the U(1) and SU(2) gaugino masses (these parameters are taken here to be\npositive), \u03bc is the Higgs mixing mass parameter, tan \u03b2 the ratio of the two Higgs v.e.v.'s,\nmA the mass of the CP-odd neutral Higgs boson, mq\u0303 is a squark soft\u2013mass common to all\nsquarks, ml\u0303 is a slepton soft\u2013mass common to all sleptons, and A is a common dimensionless\ntrilinear parameter for the third family, Ab\u0303 = At\u0303 \u2261 Amq\u0303 and A\u03c4\u0303 \u2261 Aml\u0303 (the trilinear\nparameters for the other families being set equal to zero). In our model, no gaugino\u2013mass\nunification at a Grand Unified (GUT) scale is assumed. The lightest neutralino is required\nto be the lightest supersymmetric particle and stable (because of R\u2013parity conservation).\nThe numerical analysis presented in the present paper was performed by a scanning of\nthe supersymmetric parameter space, with the following ranges of the MSSM parameters:\n1 \u2264 tan \u03b2 \u2264 50, 100 GeV \u2264 |\u03bc| \u2264 1000 GeV, 5 GeV \u2264 M1 \u2264 500 GeV, 100 GeV \u2264 M2 \u2264\n1000 GeV, 100 GeV \u2264 mq\u0303 , ml\u0303 \u2264 3000 GeV, 90 GeV \u2264 mA \u2264 1000 GeV, \u22123 \u2264 A \u2264 3.\nThe supersymmetric parameter space has been subjected to all available constraints\ndue to accelerator data on supersymmetric and Higgs boson searches (CERN e+ e\u2212 collider\nLEP2 [20] and Collider Detectors D0 and CDF at Fermilab [21]) and to other particlephysics precision results: measurements of the b \u2192 s + \u03b3 decay process [22] [2.89 \u2264\nB(b \u2192 s + \u03b3) * 10\u22124 \u2264 4.21 is employed here], the upper bound on the branching ratio\nBR(Bs0 \u2192 \u03bc\u2212 + \u03bc+ ) [23] [we take BR(Bs0 \u2192 \u03bc\u2212 + \u03bc+ ) < 1.2 * 10\u22127 ] and measurements\n3\n\n\fof the muon anomalous magnetic moment a\u03bc \u2261 (g\u03bc \u2212 2)/2: for the deviation \u2206a\u03bc of the\nexperimental world average from the theoretical evaluation within the Standard Model we\nuse here the range \u221298 \u2264 \u2206a\u03bc * 1011 \u2264 565. For other details concerning these constraints\nsee Refs. [1, 8].\nAlso included is the cosmological constraint that the neutralino relic abundance does\nnot exceed the maximal allowed value for cold dark matter, i.e. \u03a9\u03c7 h2 \u2264 (\u03a9CDM h2 )max .\nWe set (\u03a9CDM h2 )max = 0.122, as derived at the 2\u03c3 level from the results of Ref. [24]. We\nrecall that this cosmological upper bound implies on the neutralino mass the lower limit\nm\u03c7 & 7 GeV [1].\n\n3\n\nCapture rates and annihilation rates\n\nIn the present section we summarize the main formulae which we employed to evaluate the\ncapture rates of neutralinos by celestial bodies and their pair-annihilation in neutrinos.\nThe capture rate C of the relic neutralinos by a macroscopic body is given by the\nstandard formula [25]\n\u03c1\u03c7 X \u03c3el,i\n2\n(MB fi ) hvesc\ni i Xi ,\n(1)\nC=\nv\u03c7 i m\u03c7 mi\n\nwhere v\u03c7 is the neutralino mean velocity, \u03c3el,i is the cross section of the neutralino elastic\nscattering off the nucleus i of mass mi , MB fi is the total mass of the element i in the\n2\nbody of mass MB , hvesc\nii is the square escape velocity averaged over the distribution of\nthe element i, Xi is a factor which takes account of kinematical properties occurring in the\nneutralino\u2013nucleus interactions.\nThe neutralino local density is denoted by \u03c1\u03c7 . One can assume that \u03c1\u03c7 is equal to the\nlocal value of the total DM density \u03c10 , when the neutralino relic abundance (\u03a9\u03c7 h2 ) turns\nout to be at the level of a minimal (\u03a9CDM h2 )min consistent with \u03c10 . On the contrary, when\n(\u03a9\u03c7 h2 ) is smaller than (\u03a9CDM h2 )min , the value to be assigned to \u03c1\u03c7 has to be appropriately\nreduced. Thus we evaluate \u03a9\u03c7 h2 and we determine \u03c1\u03c7 by adopting a standard rescaling\nprocedure [12]:\n\u03c1\u03c7 = \u03c10 ,\n\u03c1\u03c7 = \u03c10\n\n\u03a9\u03c7 h2\n,\n(\u03a9CDM h2 )min\n\nwhen \u03a9\u03c7 h2 \u2265 (\u03a9CDM h2 )min\nwhen \u03a9\u03c7 h2 < (\u03a9CDM h2 )min\n\n(2)\n\nHere (\u03a9CDM h2 )min is set to the value 0.098, as derived at 2\u03c3 level from the results of\nRef. [24]. The neutralino relic abundance is evaluated with the procedure discussed in\nRef. [1].\nAs for the velocity distribution of relic neutralinos in the galactic halo we use here,\nfor definiteness, the standard isothermal distribution parametrized in terms of the local\nrotational velocity v0 . It is however to be recalled that the actual distribution function\ncould deviate sizably from the isothermal one (see, for instance, Ref. [26] for a systematic\n4\n\n\fanalysis of different categories of distribution functions) or even depend on non-thermalized\neffects [27]. Also the possible presence of a thick disk of dark matter could play a relevant\nrole in the capture of dark matter by celestial bodies [28]. The local rotational velocity\nv0 is set at three different representative values: the central value v0 = 220 Km s\u22121 and\ntwo extreme values v0 = 170 Km s\u22121 and v0 = 270 Km s\u22121 which bracket the v0 physical\nrange. Associated to each value of v0 we take a value of \u03c10 within its physical range\nestablished according to the procedure described in Ref. [26]. In conclusion, we will provide\nthe numerical results of our analysis for the following three sets of astrophysical parameters:\n1) v0 = 170 Km s\u22121 , \u03c10 = 0.20 GeV cm\u22123 ; 2) v0 = 220 Km s\u22121 , \u03c10 = 0.34 GeV cm\u22123 ; 3)\nv0 = 270 Km s\u22121 , \u03c10 = 0.62 GeV cm\u22123 . Note that these values of \u03c10 correspond to the\ncase of maximal amount of non halo components to DM in the galaxy [26].\nThe annihilation rate \u0393ANN is expressed in terms of the capture rate by the formula\n[29]\n\u0012 \u0013\nC\nt\n2\n\u0393ANN = tanh\n,\n(3)\n2\n\u03c4A\nwhere t is the age of the macroscopic body (t = 4.5 Gyr for Sun and Earth), \u03c4A =\n(CCA )\u22121/2 , and CA is the annihilation rate per effective volume of the body, given by\n< \u03c3v > \u0010 m\u03c7 \u00113/2\n.\n(4)\nV0\n20 GeV\nIn the above expression V0 is defined as V0 = (3m2P l T /(2\u03c1 \u00d7 10 GeV))3/2 where T and \u03c1\nare the central temperature and the central density of the celestial body. For the Earth\n(T = 6000 K, \u03c1 = 13 g * cm\u22123 ) V0 = 2.3 \u00d7 1025 cm3 , for the Sun (T = 1.4 \u00d7 107 K,\n\u03c1 = 150 g * cm\u22123 ) V0 = 6.6 \u00d7 1028 cm3 . \u03c3 is the neutralino\u2013neutralino annihilation cross\nsection and v is the relative velocity. The thermal average < \u03c3v > is calculated with all\nthe contributions at the tree level as in Ref.[30], with the further inclusion here of the two\ngluon annihilation final state [13].\nWe recall that, according to Eq. (3), in a given macroscopic body the equilibrium between capture and annihilation (i.e. \u0393ANN \u223c C/2 ) is established only when t & \u03c4A . It is\nworth noticing that the neutralino density \u03c1\u03c7 , evaluated according to Eq. (2), enters not\nonly in C but also in \u03c4A (through C). Therefore the use of a correct value for \u03c1\u03c7 (rescaled\naccording to Eq. (2), when necessary) is important also in determining whether or not the\nequilibrium is already set in a macroscopic body.\nExplicit calculations over the whole parameter space, given in the next sections, show\nthat, whereas for the Earth the equilibrium condition depends sensitively on the values of\nthe model parameters, in the case of the Sun equilibrium between capture and annihilation\nis typically reached for the whole range of m\u03c7 , due to the much more efficient capture rate\nimplied by the stronger gravitational field [25].\nThe annihilation rate given above refers to a macroscopic body as a whole. This is\ncertainly enough for the Sun which appears to us as a point source. On the contrary, in\nthe case of the Earth, one has also to define an annihilation rate referred to a unit volume\nat point ~r from the Earth center:\nCA =\n\n5\n\n\f1\n< \u03c3v > n2 (r) ,\n2\nwhere n(r) is the neutralino spatial density which may be written as [29]\n\u0393ANN (r) =\n\n2\n\nn(r) = n0 e\u2212\u03b1\u0303 m\u03c7 r ;\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\nhere \u03b1\u0303 = 2\u03c0G\u03c1/(3T ) and n0 is such that\n\u0393ANN\n\n3.1\n\n1\n= < \u03c3v >\n2\n\nZ\n\nd3 r n2 (r) .\n\n(7)\n\nWIMP\u2013nucleon cross section: hadronic uncertainties\n\nIn Ref. [31] it is stressed that the couplings between Higgs-bosons (or squarks) with nucleons, which typically play a crucial role in the evaluation of the neutralino-nucleus cross\nsection, suffer of large uncertainties [32]. Actually, these couplings are conveniently expressed in terms of three hadronic quantities, i.e.: the pion\u2013nucleon sigma term\n1\n \u0304\n\u03c3\u03c0N = (mu + md ) < N|\u016bu + dd|N\n>,\n2\n\n(8)\n\nthe quantity \u03c30 , related to the size of the SU(3) symmetry breaking,\n1\n \u0304 \u2212 2s\u0304s|N > ,\n\u03c30 \u2261 (mu + md ) < N|\u016bu + dd\n2\n\n(9)\n\nand the mass ratio r = 2ms /(mu + md ).\nBecause of a number of intrinsic theoretical and experimental problems, the determination of these hadronic quantities is rather poor. Conservatively, their ranges can be\nsummarized as follows (we refer to Refs. [31, 8] for details):\n41 MeV . \u03c3\u03c0N . 73 MeV ,\n\n(10)\n\n\u03c30 = 30 \u00f7 40 MeV ,\n\n(11)\n\nr = 29 \u00b1 7.\n\n(12)\n\nand\nIn the present paper, in order to display the influence of the uncertainties due to the\nhadronic quantities on the signals at neutrino telescopes, we will report our results for\nthree different sets of values for the quantities (\u03c3\u03c0N , \u03c30 , r) as shown in Tab. 1. The set\nREF corresponds to the set of value referred to as reference point in Ref. [8]. The sets MIN\nand MAX listed in Tab. 1 bracket the range of hadronic uncertainties.\n6\n\n\fhadronic set\n\n\u03c3\u03c0N [MeV]\n\n\u03c30 [MeV]\n\nr\n\nMIN\nREF\nMAX\n\n41\n45\n73\n\n40\n30\n30\n\n25\n29\n25\n\nTable 1: Set of values for the hadronic quantities considered in the numerical analysis.\nIn the case where the neutralino-nucleus interaction is dominated by the exchange of\nHiggs bosons, it is straightforward to estimate by how much the capture rate C is affected\nby the hadronic uncertainties. Indeed, in this case the dominant term in the interaction\namplitude of the neutralino-nucleus scattering is provided by coupling between the two\nCP-even Higgs bosons and the down-type quarks:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n23\n23\n2\nmN +\n\u03c3\u03c0N +\nr (\u03c3\u03c0N \u2212 \u03c30 ) ,\n(13)\ngd =\n27\n4\n5\nwhere mN is the nucleon mass. Then:\nCMIN /CREF \u2243 (gd, MIN /gd, REF )2 ,\n\nCMAX /CREF \u2243 (gd, MAX /gd, REF )2 .\n\n(14)\n\nUsing the values of Table 1 for the three sets of hadronic quantities, one finds for gd : gd, MIN\n= 99 MeV, gd, REF = 290 MeV, gd, MAX = 598 MeV, respectively. We thus conclude that,\nbecause of the hadronic uncertainties, the capture rate in the case of set MIN is reduced\nby a factor \u223c 9 as compared to the capture rate evaluated with the set REF, whereas C,\nevaluated with set MAX, is enhanced by a factor \u223c 4.\nThe consequences over the annihilation rate \u0393ANN is more involved, since the capture\nrate C enters in \u0393ANN not only linearly but also through \u03c4A . When in the celestial body\ncapture and annihilation are in equilibrium (t & \u03c4A ), one has \u0393ANN \u223c C/2; then \u0393ANN ,\nas a function of the hadronic quantities, rescales as C (see Eq. (14)); however, when the\nequilibrium is not realized, the uncertainties in \u0393ANN can be much more pronounced. For\ninstance, for t \u226a \u03c4A , \u0393ANN is proportional to C 2 , thus the rescaling factors for \u0393ANN are\nthe squares of those in Eq. (14).\nThese estimates will be confirmed by the numerical analysis displayed in the following\nsection.\n\n3.2\n\nNumerical evaluations\n\nEarth\nThe left panel of Fig. 1 shows the scatter plots for the ratios of the capture rates CiEarth /CREF\n(where i = set MIN, set MAX), obtained with the scanning of the parameter space illustrated in Sect. 2. One sees that, as anticipated in the previous section, the numerical values\naccumulate (most significantly for light masses), around the numerical factors shown in\nEq. (14).\n\n7\n\n\fEarth\nThe scatter plots for the ratios \u0393Earth\nANN,i /\u0393ANN,REF (where i = set MIN, set MAX) are\ndisplayed in the right panel of Fig. 1. As expected and discussed before, these numerical\nEarth\nvalues are much larger as compared to those of the ratios CiEarth /CREF\n, since many supersymmetric configurations are not able to provide a capture-annihilation equilibrium inside\nthe Earth. This interpretation is validated by the scatter plots of Fig. 2, where one sees\nthat for most configurations the equilibrium factor tanh2 (t0 /\u03c4A ) deviate largely from the\nequilibrium value tanh2 (t0 /\u03c4A ) = 1.\nThe dependence of the annihilation rate for the Sun, \u0393Sun\nANN on the hadronic uncertainties\nis shown in Fig. 3. Since the capture-annihilation equilibrium is realized in the Sun for\nSun\nall supersymmetric configurations of our model, one has here that \u0393Sun\nANN,i /\u0393ANN,REF =\nSun\nSun\nSun\nSun\nCiSun /CREF\n, which implies that \u0393Sun\nANN,MAX /\u0393ANN,REF . 4 and \u0393ANN,MIN /\u0393ANN,REF & 1/9.\nThis is at variance with the case of the Earth which we have commented before.\nMoreover, one notices from Fig. 3 that for many supersymmetric configurations \u0393Sun\nANN\ndepends very slightly (or negligibly) on the variations in the the hadronic quantities. This\nis due to the fact that on many instances the capture of neutralinos from the Sun is\ndominated by spin-dependent cross-sections.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nCalculation of neutrino fluxes\nNeutrino production\n\nOnce the Dark Matter particles are accumulated in the center of the Sun and the Earth,\nthey can annihilate into leptons, quarks, gauge and higgs bosons. These particles then\ndecay producing neutrinos. To calculate the neutrino spectra coming from each annihilation channel, lepton decay and quark hadronization process have to be considered. In\n[33], the authors have used a PYTHIA Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the spectra\nof neutrinos, coming from Dark Matter annihilation in the Sun and in the Earth, for the\nfollowing channels: bb\u0304, \u03c4 \u03c4\u0304 , cc\u0304, q q\u0304, gg (with q = u, d, s quarks). Three main differences and\nimprovements have been implemented in [33] with respect to previous calculations. The\nfirst one is the prediction of the neutrino spectra for the different neutrino flavors: \u03bde , \u03bd\u03bc\nand \u03bd\u03c4 (not only \u03bd\u03bc , like in previous works). The second main improvement consists in an\nappropriate implementation of the energy loss that hadrons and leptons can undergo before decaying. Finally, the third difference is represented by the calculation of the neutrino\nspectra for light quarks u, d, s, that were usually neglected in previous calculations.\nWe use the initial neutrino spectra reported in [33] for bb\u0304, \u03c4 \u03c4\u0304 , cc\u0304, q q\u0304 and gg annihilation\nchannels. The annihilation of two neutralinos can also produce two higgs bosons or one\ngauge and one higgs boson in the final state, although these two channels (as well as the\nannihilation channels into tt\u0304 and into two gauge bosons) are absent for m\u03c7 \u2264 80 GeV (we\nremind that our model has an absolute lower limit on the higgs mass of 90 GeV).\n\n8\n\n\f4.2\n\nNeutrino propagation\n\nFor a precise estimate of the neutrino flux at the detector site, it is important to take into\naccount the main processes that can occur during the neutrino propagation: the oscillation\nand the incoherent interaction with matter. These effects have been vastly analyzed in\n[33, 34], and then applied to specific model-dependent studies, see e.g. [35].\nThe equations that describe the evolution of the neutrino spectra can be formally\nwritten using the density matrix formalism:\nd\u03c1\nd\u03c1\n= \u2212i [H, \u03c1] +\ndr\ndr\n\n+\nNC\n\nd\u03c1\ndr\n\n.\n\n(15)\n\nCC\n\nThe first term describes the oscillation of neutrinos in matter, where the Hamiltonian is\ngiven by the sum of the mass matrix in the weak basis (\u03bde , \u03bd\u03bc , \u03bd\u03c4 ) and the Wolfenstein\npotential:\nMw \u221a\nHw =\n\u00b1 2 GF Ne diag(1, 0, 0)\n(16)\n2E\nholds for (anti-)neutrinos for the minus (plus) sign. We fix the values for the neutrino\nmixing angles and squared mass differences to the best fit values reported in [36], and\nwe set the mixing angle \u03b813 to zero. A different choice of \u03b813 would marginally affect the\nprediction on the neutrino flux, as reported in [33, 34].\nThe second term in Eq. (15) takes into account the neutrino energy loss and the reinjection due to neutral current interactions. The last term, instead, represents the neutrino\nabsorption and \u03bd\u03c4 regeneration through charge current interactions. For the explicit form\nof each term and for exhaustive explanations we refer to [33].\nFor Dark Matter annihilation inside the Sun, the integro-differential equation for the\ndensity matrix has to be solved numerically to find the neutrino spectra at the detector\nsite. For simplicity, we neglect the \u03bd\u03c4 regeneration effect, since it provides only a negligible\ncorrection for the WIMPs mass range of our interest: m\u03c7 \u2264 80 GeV.\nIn the case of annihilations inside the Earth's core, the calculation of the neutrino\nspectra can be further simplified. Indeed, the interactions with matter can be neglected,\nsince the mean free paths of neutrinos, in the core and in the mantle, are much bigger than\nthe Earth's radius R\u2295 for E\u03bd . 10 TeV (for anti-neutrinos the mean free paths are almost\na factor two greater, due to the difference in the cross-sections):\n1\nR\u2295\n\u2243 3.6 \u00d7 104\n,\ncore\n\u03c3\u03bd Ne\n(E\u03bd /GeV)\n\nR\u2295\n.\n(E\u03bd /GeV)\n(17)\nTherefore, for the propagation inside the Earth, it can be safely taken into account only the\noscillation effect. Moreover, for E\u03bd & 1 GeV, the dependence on the \"solar\" parameters\n\u2206m221 and \u03b812 is extremely weak and can be neglected. Since we are considering vanishing\n\u03b813 , Earth's matter effects are negligible and the neutrino oscillation is driven by the\n\"atmospheric\" parameters \u2206m231 and \u03b823 . In this case, the main oscillation channel is the\n\u03bbcore =\n\n\u03bbmantle =\n\n9\n\n1\n\n\u03c3\u03bd Nemantle\n\n\u2243 9.2 \u00d7 104\n\n\f\u03bd\u03bc \u2194 \u03bd\u03c4 and the value of the oscillation and the survival probability P\u03b1\u03b2 is simply given\nby the vacuum two-flavors formula:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n(\u2206m231 /eV2 )(r/km)\n2\n2\n,\n(18)\nP\u03b1\u03b2 (r, E\u03bd ) = \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2 sin (2\u03b8) sin 1.27\n(E\u03bd /GeV)\nwhere the parameter \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2 is equal to 1 (-1) for \u03b1 = \u03b2 (\u03b1 6= \u03b2).\nIn the case of the Earth, the differential muon-neutrino flux at the detector, as a function\nof the zenith angle \u03b8z , can be written as:\n!\n\u03bd\ndNf \u03bc\ndNf\u03bd\u03c4\ndN\u03bd\u03bc\n\u0393ANN X\n,\n(19)\n=\nBRf G\u03bc\u03bc (\u03b8z , E\u03bd )\n+ G\u03bc\u03c4 (\u03b8z , E\u03bd )\n2\ndE\u03bd d cos \u03b8z\n4\u03c0R\u2295\ndE\ndE\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\nf\nwhere the function G\u03b1\u03b2 (\u03b8z , E\u03bd ) encodes the dependence on the oscillation probability and\non the WIMP distribution inside the Earth. Using Eq. (6), we find the following expression:\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0001\u0003\n2 (2 m\u03c7 \u03b2\u0303)3/2 y\n2\n2\nG\u03b1\u03b2 (\u03b8z , E\u03bd ) =\ndr\nexp\n\u22122\nm\n\u03b1\u0303\nr\n+\nR\n\u2212\nry\nP\u03b1\u03b2 (r, E\u03bd ) ,\n(20)\n\u03c7\n\u2295\n\u03c0 1/2 R\u2295\n0\n\n2\nwith y \u2261 2 R\u2295 cos \u03b8n , \u03b8n \u2261 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8z and \u03b2\u0303 = \u03b1\u0303 R\u2295\n. The differential muon anti-neutrino flux\nat the detector can be obtained by a formula analogous to Eq. (19).\n\n5\n\nMuon fluxes\n\nFor the calculation of up-going muons we follow the formalism described in [37], to which\nwe refer for specific details. In these references, it has been shown that the differential\nmuon flux is given by the following expression:\nZ E\u03bd\nZ \u221e\nd\u03c3\u03bd\u03bc (E\u03bd , E\u03bc\u2032 )\ndN\u03bd\u03bc\n1\ndN\u03bc\ndE\u03bc\u2032\ndE\u03bd\n.\n(21)\n= NA\nd cos \u03b8z dE\u03bc\na + bE\u03bc E\u03bc\nd cos \u03b8z dE\u03bd\ndE\u03bc\u2032\nE\u03bc\nThe quantities a and b parametrize the energy loss due to ionization and to radiative effects,\nNA is the Avogadro's number and d\u03c3\u03bd\u03bc /dE\u03bc\u2032 is the differential charge current cross section,\nwhich is mainly due to deep inelastic scattering, for energies E\u03bd > 1 GeV. The total muon\nflux is then divided in through-going and stopping muons:\nZ \u221e\ndN\u03bc\n1\nS,T\nAS,T (L(E\u03bc ), \u03b8z ) ,\n(22)\ndE\u03bc\n\u03a6\u03bc (cos \u03b8z ) =\nA(Lmin , \u03b8z ) E\u03bcth\nd cos \u03b8z dE\u03bc\nwith E\u03bcth being the energy threshold of the detector for upward-going muons, L the muon\na+b E\u03bc\nrange in water ( L = 1b ln a+b\n) and Lmin \u2261 L(E\u03bcth ). The function AS,T (L, \u03b8z ) represents\nm\u03bc\nthe effective area for through-going and stopping muons, while, A(Lmin , \u03b8z ) is the total\neffective area of the detector, i.e. the projected area that corresponds to internal pathlengths longer than Lmin , for a fixed value of the zenith angle \u03b8z .\n10\n\n\fThe classification of upward-going muons into the two subcategories reported above is\nstrictly detector-dependent, since it depends on the shape and the size of the detector. For\na detector with cylindrical geometry (with radius R and height H), it has been shown in\n[38] that the function A(L, \u03b8z ) acquires the form:\nh\ni\n\u221a\n\u221a\nA(L, \u03b8z ) = 2RH sin \u03b8z 1 \u2212 x2 + 2R2 | cos \u03b8z | cos\u22121 x \u2212 3x 1 \u2212 x2 \u0398(Lmax (\u03b8z ) \u2212 L) ,\n(23)\nwith x = L sin \u03b8z /2R and Lmax (\u03b8z ) = min [2R/ sin \u03b8z , H/| cos \u03b8z |]. The effective area for\nstopping muons AS (L, \u03b8z ) is given by Eq. (23) and the one for through-going is AT (L, \u03b8z ) \u2261\n[A(Lmin , \u03b8z ) \u2212 A(L, \u03b8z )].\nWe will focus our analysis to the SK detector. Indeed, even if the recent results of\nIce-Cube 22-strings [39] improve the SK bound in the high mass region (m\u03c7 & 200 GeV\nfor the hard channel and m\u03c7 & 500 GeV for the soft channel), they do not constrain\nthe parameter space at low masses. The Ice-Cube detector, provided with the Deep-Core\narrays [40], will improve significantilly the SK bound for mass m\u03c7 & 40 GeV, as has been\nshown in [41], but not for the low mass range in which we are mainly interested: 7 GeV\n\u2264 m\u03c7 \u2264 80 GeV.\nThe SK detector has R = 16.9 m, H = 36.2 m and an energy threshold E\u03bcth = 1.6 GeV\n(that corresponds to Lmin = 7 m). Using these features the effective area can be calculated\nthrough Eq. (23) and, with Eq. (22), the muons coming from Dark Matter annihilation can\nbe divided in through-going and stopping muons. The same formalism can be applied to\nthe calculation of the expected muons background coming from atmospheric neutrinos.\nWe use the atmospheric neutrino flux from Honda et al. [42] and we reproduce with great\naccuracy the zenith angle distribution for stopping and through-going muons, as predicted\nby the SK collaboration. For the muon energy loss in rock and in water, we use the\ntabulated values reported in [43]. Following the analysis for through-going muons of [44],\nthe SK limit on the muon flux can be defined as:\n\u03a6(\u03b8z ; 90% C.L.) =\n\nN90\n,\nA(Lmin , \u03b8z ) \u00d7 T\n\n(24)\n\nwhere N90 is the upper Poissonian limit at the 90% C.L., given the measured events and\nthe muons background from atmospheric neutrino, and T is the detector lifetime. We\ndo not consider the detector efficiency, since it is almost equal to 100% for upward-going\nmuons. Using Eq. (24) and the SK data collected from May 1996 to July 2001 [45], we find\nthe following limits on through-going (\u03a6T\u03bc ) and stopping (\u03a6S\u03bc ) muons:\n\u03a6T\u03bc,Earth . 0.8 \u00d7 10\u221214 cm\u22122 s\u22121\n\nat 90%C.L. ,\n\n(25)\n\n\u03a6S\u03bc,Earth . 0.5 \u00d7 10\u221214 cm\u22122 s\u22121\n\nat 90%C.L. ,\n\n(26)\n\nat 90% C.L. ,\n\n(27)\n\nat 90% C.L. ,\n\n(28)\n\n\u03a6T\u03bc,Sun . 1.2 \u00d7 10\u221214 cm\u22122 s\u22121\n\n\u03a6S\u03bc,Sun . 0.5 \u00d7 10\u221214 cm\u22122 s\u22121\n11\n\n\fThe limits for the Earth are obtained considering the angular bin \u22121.0 \u2264 cos \u03b8z \u2264 \u22120.9,\nwhile the values reported for the Sun are the average limits obtained varying the zenith\nangle from cos \u03b8z = \u22121.0 to cos \u03b8z = 0.\nThe values reported in Eqs. (25)\u00f7(28) have to be compared with the muon flux induced\nby neutralinos annihilation. For the case of the Earth, we fix the angular opening to\n\u22121.0 \u2264 cos \u03b8z \u2264 \u22120.9 also for the calculation of muons coming from Dark Matter. For the\ncase of the Sun, we divide the muons in stopping and through-going using the SK effective\narea averaged over the zenith angle.\nIn the calculation of the muon flux, we neglect the kinematical angle between the\nneutrino and muon direction, which can be relatively large for muons close to threshold.\nIn any case, the average deflection angle is at most of the same order of the angular bin\nover which we integrate our signal, for the stopping and through going muons. Considering\nalso the detector resolution, to neglect the kinematical angle does not affect our results in\na relevant way. This is confirmed by the quite good agreement we obtain in our calculation\nof the atmospheric\u2013neutrino events with the SK evaluation [46].\n\n6\n\nResults and conclusions\n\nIn this section we give our results for the muon fluxes expected at a neutrino telescope\nwith a threshold muon energy of 1.6 GeV, generated by annihilation of light neutralino\npair-annihilation in the Earth and in the Sun.\n\n6.1\n\nFluxes from the Earth\n\nThe upper panel of Fig. 4 displays the scatter plots for the expected muon flux integrated\nover the muon energy for E\u03bc \u2265 1.6 GeV for the upward through-going muons. The three\ncolumns refer to the evaluation of the fluxes using in turn the three different set of hadronic\nquantities defined in Sect. 3.1.\nThe main features common to the three scatter plots are easily interpretable in terms\nof the following properties:\ni) The various peaks for m\u03c7 . 40 GeV are due to resonant capture of neutralinos on\noxygen, silicon and magnesium; indeed, these elements are almost as abundant in Earth\nas iron, which is the most relevant target nucleus for the capture of neutralinos of higher\nmass. The dip at m\u03c7 \u223c 45 GeV is a consequence of a depletion of the neutralino local\ndensity, implied by the rescaling recipe of Eq. (2) and a resonant effect in the (Z-exchange)\nneutralino pair annihilation when m\u03c7 . mZ /2 (note that the neutralino relic abundance\nis inversely proportional to the neutralino pair-annihilation).\nii) Also the fact that the muon signal for light neutralinos (m\u03c7 . 25-30 GeV) is lower\nthan the one at higher masses can be understood. Indeed, for light neutralino masses the\nbranching ratio of the annihilation process into the \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4\u0304 final state, which is the one with\nthe highest neutrino yield per annihilation, is suppressed. This last property being in turn\ndue to the fact that, for these masses, the final state in b \u2212 b\u0304 in the annihilation cross\n12\n\n\fsection has to be the dominant one in order to keep the neutralino relic abundance below\nits cosmological upper bound [1].\niii) Moreover, lower m\u03c7 masses imply softer neutrino spectra which entail fewer muons\nabove threshold.\nThe comparison of the fluxes in the three columns shows how relevant can be the role\nof the size of the hadronic quantities on the final outputs. The suppression (enhancement)\nof the flux in the case of the set MIN (MAX) as compared to the flux for the set REF are\nset by the numerical factors previously discussed for \u0393Earth\nANN . This entails that, whereas the\noverall muon flux is completely below the present experimental bound in the case of the\nminimal set of the hadronic quantities, some part of the spectrum would emerge sizably\nabove the limit for neutralino masses m\u03c7 & 50 GeV for the other sets. In the case of set\nMAX, neutralino configurations with masses m\u03c7 \u223c 15 GeV or m\u03c7 \u223c 25-30 GeV might\nproduce some measurable signal.\nSince also the dependence of the muon signals on the astrophysical parameters v0 and\n\u03c10 is important, in the lower panel of Fig. 4 we display the through-going fluxes for the\nthree representative values of v0 and \u03c10 which we discussed in Sect. 3. The overall increase\nin the fluxes in moving from left to right is essentially due to the increase in the value of\nthe local DM density. In these scatter plots the hadronic quantities are set to the value\nREF.\nThe fluxes for upward stopping-muons from the Earth are given in Fig. 5. The scheme\nof this figure is the same as the one of the previous Fig. 4: the dependence of the fluxes\non the hadronic quantities can be read in the upper panel, the one on the astrophysical\nparameters is displayed in the lower panel.\nBecause of the uncertainties affecting the evaluations of the muon fluxes, mainly due\nto the hadronic quantities, we cannot convert these results in terms of absolute constraints\non supersymmetric configurations. However, we can conclude that the analysis of stopping\nmuons from the Earth can have an interesting discovery potential not only for masses\nabove 50 GeV, but also for light neutralinos with m\u03c7 \u223c 15 GeV or m\u03c7 \u223c 25-30 GeV.\nNotice however that the neutralino configurations which provide the highest values of the\nmuon fluxes, mainly at m\u03c7 \u223c 50-70 GeV, are actually disfavored by measurements of\nWIMP direct detection [47] which have their maximal sensitivity in this mass range.\n\n6.2\n\nFluxes from the Sun\n\nThe fluxes of upward through-going muons and for stopping muons from the Sun are\nprovided in Fig. 6 and in Fig. 7, respectively. The schemes of these figures is the same as\nthe ones of the previous Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, respectively: the dependence of the fluxes on the\nhadronic quantities can be read in the upper panels of Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, the one on the\nastrophysical parameters is displayed in the lower panels of the same figures.\nFrom these results one notices that through-going muons can only be relevant for neutralinos with masses m\u03c7 & 50 GeV or m\u03c7 \u223c 35-40 GeV, whereas stopping muons can\npotentially provide information also on some supersymmetric configurations with masses\n\n13\n\n\fdown to m\u03c7 \u223c 7 GeV, in the favorable cases of high values of the hadronic quantities and\nof the astrophysical parameters.\n\n6.3\n\nFluxes of stopping muons for supersymmetric configurations\nselected by the DAMA/LIBRA annual modulation data\n\nNow we give the expected upward muon fluxes from Earth and Sun which would be produced by neutralino configurations which fit the annual modulation data of the DAMA/LIBRA\nexperiment [6]. As before, for definiteness the analysis is performed in the framework of\nthe isothermal sphere. The selection of the supersymmetric configurations is performed on\nthe basis of the analysis carried out in Ref. [8]: for any set of astrophysical parameters and\nhadronic quantities, from the whole neutralino population are extracted the configurations\nwhich fit the experimental annual modulation data, and the relevant muon fluxes are evaluated. As for the yearly modulation data, we consider both outputs of the experimental\nanalysis of the DAMA Collaboration: those where the channelling effect [5] is included as\nwell as those where this effect is neglected. We recall that the way by which the channeling\neffect has to be taken into account in the analysis is still under study; thus the actual physical outputs in the analysis of the experimental data in terms of specific DM candidates\ncould stay mid-way, between the case defined as channeling and the no-channeling one,\nrespectively.\nWe only report the results for stopping muons, since, as we have seen above, this is\nthe category of events which can provide the most sizable signals. To avoid proliferation\nof figures, only fluxes calculated with the set REF for the hadronic quantities is reported\nhere.\nFig. 8 displays the fluxes for the upward stopping muons expected from the Earth in\ncase of no-channeling (upper panel) and in the case of channeling (lower panel). The\ncorresponding fluxes from the Sun are shown in Fig. 9.\nWe note that depending on the role of channeling in the extraction of the physical\nsupersymmetric configurations, the stopping muon fluxes can have a discovery potential\nwith an interesting complementarity between the signals from the two celestial bodies:\nwhereas the flux from the Earth cannot give insights into neutralino masses below about\n15 GeV, the flux from the Sun would potentially be able to measure effects down to m\u03c7 \u223c\n7 GeV.\nIt is worth remarking that under favorable conditions provided by the actual values of\nthe involved parameters, a combination of the annual modulation data and of measurements at neutrino telescopes could help in pinning down the features of the DM particle\nand in restraining the ranges of the many quantities (of astrophysical and particle-physics\norigins) which enter in the evaluations and still suffer from large uncertainties.\nWe stress once more that the present analysis, for definiteness, was performed only in\nthe standard case of a halo DM distribution function given by an isothermal sphere. Use\nof different halo distributions such as those mentioned in Sect. 3 could modify sizably the\nrole of specific supersymmetric configurations.\n14\n\n\fWe wish here to recall that indirect signals of light neutralinos could also be provided\nby future measurements of cosmic antideuterons in space [10]. Finally, investigations at\nthe Large Hadron Collider will hopefully provide a crucial test bench for the very existence\nof these light supersymmetric stable particles [48].\nAcknowledgments\nWe acknowledge Research Grants funded jointly by Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universit\u00e0\ne della Ricerca, by Universit\u00e0 di Torino and by Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare within\nthe Astroparticle Physics Project.

The local rotational velocity is set to its central value: v0 = 220 Km\ns\u22121 (\u03c10 = 0.34 GeV cm\u22123 ).\n\nFigure 2: Equilibrium factor tanh2 (t0 /\u03c4A ), in the case of the Earth, displayed for the\nhadronic sets MIN, REF and MAX. The local rotational velocity is set to its central value:\nv0 = 220 Km s\u22121 (\u03c10 = 0.34 GeV cm\u22123 ).\n\n21\n\n\fFigure 3: Ratios of annihilation rates, in the case of the Sun, calculated for the hadronic\nsets MIN and MAX with respect to the hadronic set REF. The local rotational velocity is\nset to its central value: v0 = 220 Km s\u22121 (\u03c10 = 0.34 GeV cm\u22123 ).\n\n22\n\n\fFigure 4: Upward through-going muon flux, generated by light neutralino pair-annihilation\ninside the Earth. The upper panel shows the dependence of the muon flux on the hadronic\nquantities, for fixed values of the astrophysical parameters: v0 = 220 Km s\u22121 and \u03c10 = 0.34\nGeV cm\u22123 . The lower panel shows the dependence of the muon flux on the local rotational\nvelocity v0 and the total DM density \u03c10 , for the hadronic set REF. The horizontal line\nrepresents the experimental limit on through-going muons from the Earth obtained using\nthe SK data, see Eq. (25).\n\n23\n\n\fFigure 5: The same as Fig. 4, but in the case of upward stopping muons. In this case, the\nhorizontal line refers to the experimental limit on stopping muons from the Earth obtained\nusing the SK data, see Eq. (26).\n\n24\n\n\fFigure 6: The same as Fig. 4, but in the case of light neutralino pair-annihilation inside\nthe Sun. In this case, the horizontal line refers to the experimental limit on through-going\nmuons from the Sun obtained using the SK data, see Eq. (27).\n\n25\n\n\fFigure 7: The same as Fig. 4, but in the case of light neutralino pair-annihilation inside\nthe Sun and of upward stopping muons. In this case, the horizontal line refers to the experimental limit on stopping muons from the Sun obtained using the SK data, see Eq. (28).\n\n26\n\n\fFigure 8: Upward stopping muon flux, generated by light neutralino pair-annihilation\ninside the Earth. The configurations displayed are only the ones compatible with the\nDAMA/LIBRA annual modulation region, obtained without including the channeling effect\n(upper panel) and including the channeling effect (lower panel). The three columns show\nthe results for the different sets of astrophysical parameters, defined in Sect. 3. The set\nREF is used for the hadronic quantities. The horizontal line represents the experimental\nlimit on stopping muons from the Earth obtained using the SK data, see Eq. (26).\n\n27\n\n\fFigure 9: The same as Fig. 8, but in the case of light neutralino pair-annihilation inside the\nSun. In this case, the horizontal line refers to the experimental limit on stopping muons\nfrom the Sun obtained using the SK data, see Eq. (28).\n\n28\n\n\f"}
