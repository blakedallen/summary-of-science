Our sample consists of\n146 UV-selected galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts 1.5 \u2264 zspec < 2.6 in the GOODS-North field.\nSupplemented with deep Very Large Array (VLA) and Spitzer imaging, we construct median stacks\nat the positions of these galaxies at 24, 100, and 160 \u03bcm, and 1.4 GHz. The comparison between\nthese stacked fluxes and a variety of dust templates and calibrations implies that typical star-forming\ngalaxies with UV luminosities LUV & 1010 L\u2299 at z \u223c 2 are luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) with\na median LIR = (2.2 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 1011 L\u2299 . Their median ratio of LIR to rest-frame 8 \u03bcm luminosity\n(L8 ) is LIR /L8 = 8.9 \u00b1 1.3 and is \u2248 80% larger than that found for most star-forming galaxies at\nz . 2. This apparent redshift evolution in the LIR /L8 ratio may be tied to the trend of larger infrared\nluminosity surface density for z & 2 galaxies relative to those at lower redshift. Typical galaxies at\n1.5 \u2264 z < 2.6 have a median dust obscuration LIR /LUV = 7.1 \u00b1 1.1, which corresponds to a dust\ncorrection factor, required to recover the bolometric star formation rate (SFR) from the unobscured\nUV SFR, of 5.2 \u00b1 0.6. This result is similar to that inferred from previous investigations of the UV,\nH\u03b1, 24 \u03bcm, radio, and X-ray properties of the same galaxies studied here. Stacking in bins of UV\nslope (\u03b2) implies that L\u2217 galaxies with redder spectral slopes are also dustier, and that the correlation\nbetween \u03b2 and dustiness is similar to that found for local starburst galaxies. Hence, the rest-frame\n\u2243 30 and 50 \u03bcm fluxes validate on average the use of the local UV attenuation curve to recover the\ndust attenuation of typical star-forming galaxies at high redshift. In the simplest interpretation, the\nagreement between the local and high redshift UV attenuation curves suggests a similarity in the dust\nproduction and stellar and dust geometries of starburst galaxies over the last 10 billion years.\nSubject headings: galaxies: high-redshift - infrared: galaxies - ISM: dust, extinction\n1.

The ability\nto quantify dust attenuation at high redshift is hindered\nby the limited dynamic range in luminosity at wavelengths that are sensitive to dust emission. While the\nLyman Break technique (Steidel et al. 1995) has proven\nto be the most effective method of identifying galaxies\nacross a large dynamic range in luminosity and lookback time, it requires observations in the rest-frame UV:\nthe massive stars giving rise to the UV continuum also\nproduce much of the dust that attenuates this continuum. The diminution of UV light is compounded by the\nfact that much of this radiation is re-emitted in the farinfrared where current instrumental sensitivity is insufficient to directly detect typical star-forming galaxies at\nz & 2. It has therefore become common to use local relations between monochromatic and bolometric luminosity\nto infer the star formation rates and dust attenuation of\nhigh-redshift galaxies.\nPrior to the era of large-scale multi-wavelength surveys\nlike GOODS (Dickinson et al. 2003; Giavalisco et al.\n2004), inferring the dust attenuation at high redshift\ncommonly entailed using relations between the variation\nof the UV continuum slope with dustiness as found for local starburst galaxies (Meurer et al. 1999; Calzetti et al.\n\n\f2\n2000; Heckman et al. 1998). However, such correlations\nwere previously untested at high redshift. The correlation between the redness of the UV slope (\u03b2) and dust\nattenuation has limited applicability when examined over\na larger range in galaxy stellar population and luminosity. Galaxies with older and less massive stars contributing significantly to the UV emission can also exhibit a\nredder spectral slope (Calzetti 1997; Kong et al. 2004;\nBuat et al. 2005). Further, the UV slope decouples from\nextinction for very luminous galaxies where virtually all\nof the star formation is obscured, such as is the case for\nlow redshift ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs;\nGoldader et al. 2002). Nonetheless, the local trend between UV slope and dustiness is still applied widely to\ngalaxies at high redshift; this correlation is often the only\nmeans by which one can infer the dust attenuation of\ngalaxies at z & 3, where the dust emission from a typical galaxy may be several orders of magnitude below the\nsensitivity limits of current infrared instruments.\nIncremental progress in determining dust attenuation at high redshift was achieved with the first ultradeep radio and X-ray surveys (e.g., Richards 2000;\nAlexander et al. 2003). Though the sensitivity (even\nat GOODS-depth) at these wavelengths was insufficient to individually detect typical star-forming galaxies at z & 2, these surveys did allow for estimates\nof the mean dust attenuation based on stacking analyses. Initial studies suggested a general agreement between UV and radio/X-ray inferences of dust attenuation at z \u223c 2 \u2212 3 (Nandra et al. 2002; Seibert et al.\n2002; Reddy & Steidel 2004; Reddy et al. 2005, 2006b;\nDaddi et al. 2007; Pannella et al. 2009).\nThe launch of the Spitzer Space Telescope enabled\nthe first direct detection of the dust emission in nonlensed L\u2217 galaxies at z \u223c 2; at these redshifts,\nSpitzer's MIPS 24 \u03bcm band is sensitive to the strongest\ndust emission feature (at 7.7 \u03bcm) in star-forming galaxies. This feature arises from the stochastic UV photoheating of small dust grains and hydrocarbons (e.g.,\nPuget & Leger 1989; Tielens et al. 1999) and is found\nto correlate with the UV radiation from OB stars (e.g.,\nF\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. 2004; Roussel et al. 2001), albeit with significant scatter (e.g., Kennicutt et al. 2009;\nHogg et al. 2005; Helou et al. 2001; Engelbracht et al.\n2005; Normand et al. 1995). Several studies have demonstrated that the dust attenuation inferred from the UV\nspectral slope, \u03b2, for typical z \u223c 2 galaxies is in general agreement with that inferred from MIPS 24 \u03bcm (e.g.,\nReddy et al. 2006b, 2010; Daddi et al. 2007). Regardless, local studies of resolved galaxies have emphasized\nthe complexity of the 8 \u03bcm emission and the need to\ncombine it with other obscured (IR) and unobscured\n(UV, H\u03b1) tracers of star formation in order to obtain\nthe most reliable measure of the bolometric luminosity\n(Kennicutt et al. 2009).\nTo this end, we take advantage of the improved\nsensitivity of Herschel/PACS at 100 and 160 \u03bcm\n(Pilbratt et al. 2010; Poglitsch et al. 2010) to measure\ndirectly for the first time the thermal dust emission from\na large sample of typical (L\u2217 ) star-forming galaxies at\nz \u223c 2. We make use of the deep PACS data made possible by the GOODS-Herschel Open Time Key project\n(PI: D. Elbaz). We supplement these data with deep\nVery Large Array (VLA) 1.4 GHz continuum imaging\n\nin the GOODS-North field (Morrison et al. 2010). The\nprimary aim is to constrain the average infrared luminosities of galaxies at high redshift, particularly those\nselected by their rest-frame UV colors, and to compare\nthem to UV-based inferences. We begin in Section 2 by\ndiscussing the UV-selected galaxies and previous efforts\nto measure their stellar populations and dust attenuation. We also provide a brief description of the Herschel\nand radio data. Our stacking method and stacking simulations are described in Section 3, followed by a discussion of the dust spectral energy distribution (SED) fits\nto the stacked fluxes and the total infrared luminosities\nin Section 4. In Section 5 we proceed to compare the\nHerschel-based inferences of the dust attenuation with\nthat inferred from the UV slope and discuss systematics in the dust obscuration with stellar population age\nand bolometric and UV luminosity. For ease of comparison with other studies, we assume a Salpeter (1955)\ninitial mass function (IMF) and adopt a cosmology with\nH0 = 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, and \u03a9m = 0.3.\n2. SAMPLE SELECTION AND HERSCHEL PACS 100 AND\n160 \u03bcM DATA\n\n2.1. Rest-Frame UV-Selected Sample of Star-Forming\n\nGalaxies at z \u223c 2 \u2212 3\nThe GOODS-North field was targeted as part of an ongoing imaging and spectroscopic survey of UV-selected\ngalaxies at z \u223c 2 \u2212 3 (Steidel et al. 2004), primarily to\ntake advantage of the extensive multi-wavelength data\nthat exist for this field. Spectroscopic catalogs and analysis of the GOODS-North sample, including the stellar\nmasses and dust attenuation of L\u2217 galaxies at z \u223c 2 \u2212 3,\nare presented in Reddy et al. (2006a). Briefly, the galaxies were selected to lie at redshifts 1.5 . z . 3.4 based\non the \"BM,\" \"BX,\" and Lyman Break galaxy (LBG)\ncolor criteria (Steidel et al. 2003, 2004; Adelberger et al.\n2004). Extensive spectroscopic followup of candidates\nbrighter than R = 25.5 was conducted using the blue\narm of the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (LRIS;\nSteidel et al. 2004) on the Keck I telescope.\nThe criteria used to construct our sample are identical to those of Reddy et al. (2010). Only galaxies with\nsecure spectroscopic redshifts 1.5 \u2264 zspec \u2264 2.6 were considered as this is the redshift range over which the MIPS\nband is sensitive to rest-frame 8 \u03bcm emission. Galaxies with any AGN signatures based on optical emission\nlines (Ly\u03b1, CIV, NV) or a power-law SED through the\nIRAC and MIPS 24 \u03bcm bands were excluded. Additionally, galaxies were included only if we were able to obtain\nrobust point spread function (PSF) fits to their 24 \u03bcm\nemission; in practice, this meant that a few galaxies were\nrejected because they are confused with nearby neighbors (see Reddy et al. 2010 for the parameter used to\nmeasure the degeneracy of the PSF fits). This sample\nforms the basis of our stacking analysis, and includes a\ntotal of 146 galaxies, approximately 30% of which are detected with greater than 3 \u03c3 significance in the GOODSN 24 \u03bcm data.\n2.2. Properties of the Sample and SED Modeling\n\nReddy & Steidel (2009) use a larger spectroscopic and\nphotometric sample (the latter extending to R \u223c 27.0)\nin 31 independent fields to quantify the selection function for the UV sample and determine the UV luminosity\n\n\f3\nfunction at z \u223c 2. This analysis indicates that UVselected galaxies commonly targeted for spectroscopy\nwith R . 25.5 have luminosities similar to L\u2217 of the\nUV luminosity function, where L\u2217UV \u2248 4 \u00d7 1010 L\u2299\n(Reddy & Steidel 2009). Throughout the text, L\u2217 refers\nto the characteristic luminosity of the UV luminosity\nfunction, unless stated otherwise. The stellar populations of these galaxies have been modeled previously, and\nwe refer the reader to Reddy et al. (2010) for a detailed\ndescription of the modeling procedure.\nBriefly, Charlot & Bruzual (in prep.) stellar population models with a range of exponentially-declining\nstar formation histories \u03c4 = 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500,\n1000, 2000, and 5000 Myr, as well as a constant star formation history, were fit to the observed Un GR, JKs ,\nand Spitzer/IRAC data. In addition, we considered ages\nspaced roughly logarithmically between 70 and 5000 Myr,\nexcluding any that are older than the age of the Universe\nat the redshift of each galaxy. The lower limit to the allowed ages (70 Myr) was adopted to reflect the typical\ndynamical time-scale as inferred from velocity dispersion\nand size measurements of z \u223c 2 LBGs (Erb et al. 2006;\nLaw et al. 2007). Reddening was incorporated by employing the Calzetti et al. (2000) attenuation curve and\nallowing E(B \u2212 V ) to range between 0.0 and 0.6.\nWe adopt the best-fit stellar population parameters obtained when assuming a constant star formation (CSF)\nhistory, unless an exponentially declining (\u03c4 ) model gives\na significantly better fit to the broadband data. Generally, the \u03c72 values assuming the CSF model were similar to those obtained when \u03c4 is allowed to vary freely.\nFurther, more extreme star formation histories, where\nthe ratio of the age to \u03c4 is much greater than unity,\ni.e., tage /\u03c4 \u226b 1, can be ruled out based on the presence\nof O star and Wolf-Rayet features in the composite UV\nspectra of z \u223c 2 galaxies, as well as the fact that such\nmodels often predict ages that are unrealistically much\nyounger than the dynamical timescale at z \u223c 2. For the\npresent analysis, we use the results of the stellar population modeling to distinguish those galaxies that have\nyoung star formation ages . 100 Myr. Such galaxies have\nbeen shown previously to depart from the UV attenuation curve established for more typical galaxies at z \u223c 2\n(Reddy et al. 2010, 2006b), and we wish to explore this\ndifference with the Herschel data.\n2.3. Construction of Subsamples\n\nThe sample of 146 UV-selected galaxies was subdivided\ninto subsamples in order to investigate the differences in\ndust attenuation between galaxies with blue and red UV\nspectral slopes, those with high bolometric luminosities\n(Lbol \u2261 LIR + LUV ), and those with young stellar population ages. The properties of these subsamples, including the criteria used to construct them, the number of\ngalaxies in each subsample, and their \u03b2 and redshift distributions, are summarized in Table 1. As noted above,\nthe ages are estimated from stellar population modeling\nof the rest-frame UV through Spitzer IRAC photometry.\nFor the purpose of contructing the subsamples, we estimated bolometric luminosities based on the Reddy et al.\n(2010) calibration between 8 \u03bcm and infrared luminosity\n(see next section). Finally, UV slopes \u03b2 were determined\nfrom the G \u2212 R colors of galaxies as follows. We generated power laws in f (\u03bb) \u221d \u03bb\u03b2 for \u22122.5 \u2264 \u03b2 \u2264 1.0\n\nwith \u2206\u03b2 = 0.01. These were attenuated for the Ly\u03b1\nforest opacity assuming the Madau (1995) prescription\nand multiplied by the G and R transmission filters. The\nG band is affected by the Ly\u03b1 forest only for redshifts\nz = 2.5; statistical fluctuations in the forest will not affect \u03b2 as most of the galaxies considered here lie below\nredshift z \u2264 2.5. For this same reason, Ly\u03b1 lies outside\nof the G-band filter and will therefore not affect \u03b2. The\nUV slope for a given galaxy is taken to be the one which\ngives the closest match in G \u2212 R color to the observed\nvalue. The error in UV slope is related directly to the\nerror in color and is typically \u03c3\u03b2 \u2243 0.11.\n2.4. Previous MIPS Results\nTo provide a context for our present analysis, we\nbriefly summarize previous efforts to constrain the dust\nemission and bolometric luminosities of galaxies at z \u223c\n2 \u2212 3. Reddy et al. (2006b) investigated the variation\nin 24 \u03bcm flux with dust-corrected UV and X-ray measures of the bolometric luminosities of the same UVselected galaxies analyzed here. Extending upon this\nresult, Reddy et al. (2010) used a sample of 90 Lyman\nBreak galaxies to examine the relationship between restframe 8 \u03bcm (\u03bdL\u03bd [8\u03bcm] \u2261 L8 ) and H\u03b1 luminosity at\nz \u223c 2, finding a tight trend between the two, with a\nscatter of \u2248 0.24 dex. Using H\u03b1 luminosity as a proxy\nfor total star formation rate \u2013 after accounting for dust\nwith a Calzetti et al. (2000) attenuation curve \u2013 then allowed these authors to establish a relationship between\nL8 and dust obscured SFR, or LIR .\nThe previous studies found that typical (L\u2217 ) starforming galaxies at z \u223c 2 have dust attenuations, or\ninfrared-to-UV luminosity ratios, LIR /LUV \u2243 5, similar\nto the values predicted from the UV slope, \u03b2, using the\nlocal correlation between \u03b2 and LIR /LUV (Meurer et al.\n1999). Investigations of the 24 \u03bcm emission of galaxies\nselected at rest-frame optical wavelengths \u2013 resulting in\nsamples that are not orthogonal to the one analyzed here\n\u2013 have reached similar conclusions regarding the validity\nof UV-based dust corrections for moderately-luminous\ngalaxies at z \u223c 2 (Daddi et al. 2007). These results have\nbeen extended to higher redshift: Magdis et al. (2010a)\ndemonstrate that UV-based dust corrections for LBGs at\nz \u223c 3 yield bolometric luminosities comparable to those\ninferred from infrared, radio, and millimeter measures.\nThe 160 \u03bcm emission from z \u223c 3 LBGs also corresponds\nto LIR that are similar to those obtained with 24 \u03bcm estimates (Magdis et al. 2010b). While this is important validation of our understanding of star formation and dust\nobscuration at high redshift, the LBGs that Magdis et al.\n(2010b) detected in stacked 160 \u03bcm data have significantly higher luminosities (hLIR i \u2248 1.6 \u00d7 1012 L\u2299 ) and\nstar formation rates (> 100 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ) than those of the\ntypical, L\u2217 , galaxies analyzed here.\nIn any case, while this agreement is encouraging, and\ninstills confidence in our ability to recover the dust attenuation of typical galaxies from measurements of their\nUV continuum slopes, uncertainties in the k-corrections\nand the conversion between 8 \u03bcm and infrared luminosity\n(as well as conversion between X-ray emission and SFR,\nfor the X-ray stacking analyses) no doubt introduce some\nscatter in the inferred dust obscurations. The primary\ngoal of our present analysis to obtain more direct measures of the total infrared luminosities of z \u223c 2 galaxies\n\n\f4\nTABLE 1\nProperties of the Stacks I: 100 \u03bcm Fluxes, Redshifts, and UV Slopes\n\nSample\n\nCriterion\n\nf100\nrexc = 3.\u2032\u2032 43\n\na\n\nf100\nNo Exclusion\n\nb\n\n10\u22124\n\nc\n\n10\u22124\n\nA.\nALL\nUVSELECTED\n\nAll\n\n(3.0 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7\nJy\nN = 106\nh\u03b2i = \u22121.41 \u00b1 0.42\nhzi = 2.08 \u00b1 0.24\n\n(3.0 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7\nJy\nN = 146\nh\u03b2i = \u22121.41 \u00b1 0.41\nhzi = 2.08 \u00b1 0.26\n\nB.\nL\u2217\nGALAXIES\n\nAge & 100 Myr;\nLbol \u2264 1012 L\u2299\n\n(2.4 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10\u22124 Jy\nN = 83\nh\u03b2i = \u22121.48 \u00b1 0.37\nhzi = 2.09 \u00b1 0.24\n\n(2.8 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10\u22124 Jy\nN = 114\nh\u03b2i = \u22121.46 \u00b1 0.38\nhzi = 2.09 \u00b1 0.25\n\nC.\nBLUE\nUV-SLOPES\n\nAge & 100 Myr;\nLbol \u2264 1012 L\u2299 ;\n\u03b2 < \u22121.4\n\n(1.9 \u00b1 0.7) \u00d7 10\u22124 Jy\nN = 51\nh\u03b2i = \u22121.61 \u00b1 0.21\nhzi = 2.05 \u00b1 0.24\n\n(2.1 \u00b1 0.7) \u00d7 10\u22124 Jy\nN = 67\nh\u03b2i = \u22121.59 \u00b1 0.21\nhzi = 2.05 \u00b1 0.26\n\nD.\nRED\nUV-SLOPES\n\nAge & 100 Myr;\nLbol \u2264 1012 L\u2299 ;\n\u03b2 \u2265 \u22121.4\n\n(3.8 \u00b1 0.9) \u00d7 10\u22124 Jy\nN = 32\nh\u03b2i = \u22121.10 \u00b1 0.26\nhzi = 2.19 \u00b1 0.22\n\n(3.4 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10\u22124 Jy\nN = 47\nh\u03b2i = \u22121.15 \u00b1 0.26\nhzi = 2.14 \u00b1 0.24\n\nE.\nULIRGs\n\nAge & 100 Myr;\nLbol > 1012 L\u2299\n\n(11.0 \u00b1 1.7) \u00d7 10\u22124 Jy\nN =9\nh\u03b2i = \u22120.84 \u00b1 0.48\nhzi = 2.03 \u00b1 0.27\nhLbol i = (1.3 \u00b1 0.1) \u00d7 1012 L\u2299\n12 L\nLmax\n\u2299\nbol = 1.8 \u00d7 10\n\n(9.9 \u00b1 1.2) \u00d7 10\u22124 Jy\nN = 12\nh\u03b2i = \u22120.84 \u00b1 0.46\nhzi = 2.22 \u00b1 0.29\nhLbol i = (1.3 \u00b1 0.1) \u00d7 10\u22124 L\u2299\n12 L\nLmax\n\u2299\nbol = 1.8 \u00d7 10\n\nF.\nYOUNG\nGALAXIES\n\nAge . 100 Myr\n\n3 \u03c3: < 4.4 \u00d7 10\u22124 Jy\nN = 14\nh\u03b2i = \u22121.17 \u00b1 0.40\nhzi = 2.00 \u00b1 0.26\n\n3 \u03c3: < 3.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 Jy\nN = 20\nh\u03b2i = \u22121.30 \u00b1 0.40\nhzi = 2.00 \u00b1 0.28\n\nNOTE. \u2013 Each entry includes (a) the stacked flux at 100 \u03bcm and its measurement uncertainty; (b) the\nnumber of galaxies contributing to the stack; and (c) the mean and sample dispersion of the UV slopes (\u03b2)\nand redshifts of those galaxies.

Herschel and VLA Data\n\nThe GOODS-Herschel Open Time Key Program (PI:\nD. Elbaz) includes \u2248 124 hrs of 100 and 160 \u03bcm PACS\nimaging and 31 hrs of SPIRE imaging in the GOODSNorth field. The 3 \u03c3 depths of the PACS 100 and 160 \u03bcm\nimages are 1.1 mJy and 2.6 mJy, respectively. None of\nthe galaxies in the sample analyzed here are detected\nto these depths. Further details on the data reduction\nare given in Elbaz et al. (2011). PSFs were constructed\nbased on the catalogs of Herschel detections discussed in\nElbaz et al. (2011). When performing PSF photometry,\nwe adjusted all fluxes upward by multiplicative factors of\n1.37 and 1.29 at 100 and 160 \u03bcm respectively, to account\nfor missing flux in the wings of the PSFs. The similar\nfactor for the MIPS 24 \u03bcm PSF is 1.22.\nThe VLA radio 1.4 GHz data are described in\nMorrison et al. (2010). Briefly, a total of 165 hrs of observations, including 42 hr from Richards (2000), were combined to produce a radio map of the GOODS-North field.\n\nThe noise level of the image is \u223c 3.9 \u03bcJy beam\u22121 near the\ncenter and \u223c 8 \u03bcJy beam\u22121 at 15\u2032 from the center. The\nsynthesized beamsize of the radio data is \u223c 1.\u2032\u2032 7 \u00d7 1.\u2032\u2032 6,\ncorresponding to a physical scale of 14.1 \u00d7 13.3 kpc at\nz = 2.30. The radio map used in the stacking analysis is\nprimary beam corrected.\n3. STACKING METHOD AND SIMULATIONS\n3.1. General Stacking Procedure\n\nThe method used to stack the Herschel 100 and\n160 \u03bcm, Spitzer 24 \u03bcm, and the VLA radio data is as follows. We extracted an area 50\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 50\u2032\u2032 around each object\nto be stacked. The area was chosen to be large enough to\nobtain a reliable estimate of the local background. These\ncutouts were then median combined after rotating each\nsub-image by 90\u25e6 relative the previous sub-image contributing to the stack, in order to minimize image defects\nthat are aligned with the scanning orientation of the data\nacquisition.17 We adopted the median stacks to ensure\n17 To test for any systematic effect associated with asymmetries\nin the PSF, we also stacked without rotating each sub-image. The\n\n\f5\n\nFig. 1.- PSF-convolved median stacked images for \"Sample B\"\n(L\u2217 galaxies) at 24, 100, 160 \u03bcm, and 1.4 GHz, with pixel scales of\n\u2032\u2032\n1. 2, 1.\u2032\u2032 2, 2.\u2032\u2032 4, and 0.\u2032\u2032 5, respectively.\n\nthe results are not biased by bright outliers. We stacked\nthe 24 \u03bcm data in exactly the same way as was done\nfor the 100 and 160 \u03bcm data, irrespective of whether a\ngalaxy was directly detected at 24 \u03bcm, in order to ensure\nthe most consistent results across wavelengths.18\nTo test the effects of a non-negligible amount of flux\nin the wings of the stacked signal relative to the PSF\n(due to positional uncertainty), we performed both PSFfitting photometry and simple aperture photometry on\nthe stacked flux. The background and measurement uncertainty in the stacked image are taken respectively to\nbe the mean and 1 \u03c3 dispersion in flux computed by fitting many PSFs at random positions in the stacked image. We simulatenously fit the target flux (with a PSF)\nand a constant value to account for the background level\nin the stacked image. We found no significant systematic bias in the aperture versus PSF-derived flux relative\nto the measurement uncertainties, and we adopted the\nPSF-determined flux measurements. For the radio data,\nthe PSF-measured flux and total integrated flux differ by\n\u2248 20 \u2212 30% due to bandwidth smearing. To account for\nthis effect, we have adopted the fluxes computed from\nfitting the best-fit elliptical Gaussian profile (with peak\nintensity normalized to unity) to the stacked radio emission, yielding the integrated flux density.\n3.2. Residual Images\nResidual maps at 100 and 160 \u03bcm were constructed in\norder to ensure the most robust determinations of the\nstacked fluxes.19 Sources detected at > 3 \u03c3 were subtracted from the science mosaics (none of the galaxies in\nour sample are detected at 100 and 160 \u03bcm at this level).\nWe considered detections based both on a blind catalog\nresults obtained with and without rotating the sub-images were\nidentical within the uncertainties of the stacked flux measurements.\n18 For the most conservative estimate of the stacked radio flux,\nwe did not correct for bandwidth smearing (e.g., Pannella et al.\n2009), rather we fit an elliptical Gaussian to the stacked light profile\nand adopted the peak value for the radio flux.\n19 We did not construct a residual map for the VLA data given\nthe higher resolution of these data and the lower 1.4 GHz source\nsurface density.\n\n(\"blind-subtracted\"), where a detection algorithm was\nused directly on the PACS mosaics, as well as a catalog constructed using 24 \u03bcm priors to define the positions of sources in the longer wavelength PACS bands\n(\"prior-substracted\"). In both cases, we used PSF photometry to determine the fluxes of sources and subtract\nthem from the science images. To ensure that there are\nno systematic effects that may bias the flux measurement made on the residual maps, we performed the same\nstacking analysis on the science images themselves. Comparison between the stacks on the blind-residual maps,\nprior-residual maps, and the science images, showed that\nthe stacked fluxes were within 10% of each other. Typically, the stacked fluxes measured on the science images\nwere lower than those measured on the residual images.\nThis effect is attributed to the higher background level in\nthe stack derived from the science images due to the PSF\nwings of nearby sources. The similarity in flux regardless\nof the image used for the stack suggests that the median\ncombination of sub-images is robust to bright outliers,\nas expected. The flux measurements obtained by stacking on the prior-fit residual maps are adopted for further\nanalysis. The median stacked data for L\u2217 galaxies (Sample B; Table 1) at 24, 100, and 160 \u03bcm, and 1.4 GHz, are\nshown in Figure 1.\n3.3. Exclusion Tests and Simulations\n\nA common concern in stacking data with relatively\npoor resolution is the potential contribution from unrelated sources within the beam that are formally undetected (i.e., with a < 3 \u03c3 significance) and which therefore remain in the residual images, but which may contribute significantly to the stacked flux. If these unrelated sources have a random spatial distribution, then\ntheir contribution to the stacked flux will be accounted\nfor when we subtract the background in the stacked images. However, if the unrelated sources are clustered with\nrespect to the UV-selected galaxies, they will contribute\nto the stacked fluxes. To test for the effect of clustering\non the stacked fluxes, we considered a number of tests,\nas we describe below.\n3.3.1. Exclusion Radius\n\nThe most conservative measure of the median flux can\nbe achieved by stacking only those galaxies without any\nnearby sources. The full-width-half-max (FWHM) of the\nPSF at 100 \u03bcm is small enough (\u2243 6\u2032\u2032 ) such that we can\nadopt an \"exclusion radius\" rexc =FWHM/2, and still\nhave enough galaxies to stack. We first constructed a\ncatalog containing all optical, Ks -band, and IRAC detections in the GOODS-North field. The 3 \u03c3 sensitivities, as measured in a 2\u2032\u2032 diameter aperture in the optical and Ks -band images, are R \u2243 27.6 and Ks \u2243 24.55.\nThe 3 \u03c3 sensitivities of the GOODS-North IRAC data,\nas measured in a 4\u2032\u2032 diameter aperture, are 26.56, 26.00,\n24.17, and 24.16, for the 4 IRAC channels, respectively.\nAny galaxies in our sample that lie within a distance\nrexc of any source detected in the optical, near-IR, or\nwith IRAC, are excluded from the stack. The sample\nitself was selected such that galaxies that were confused\nwith any nearby MIPS 24 \u03bcm sources were excluded.\nThe median 100 \u03bcm fluxes obtained with and without adopting an exclusion radius are listed in Table 1.\nThe differences between these fluxes are smaller than\n\n\f6\nTABLE 2\nProperties of the Stacks II: Summary of Mid-IR, IR, and Radio Fluxes\n\nSample\nA.\nB.\nC.\nD.\nE.\nF.\n\nf24\n(Jy)\n\nf100\n(Jy)\n\nf160\n(Jy)\n\nf1.4\n(Jy)\n\n(33 \u00b1 4) \u00d7 10\u22126\n(27 \u00b1 2) \u00d7 10\u22126\n(21 \u00b1 3) \u00d7 10\u22126\n(35 \u00b1 3) \u00d7 10\u22126\n(130 \u00b1 4) \u00d7 10\u22126\n(10 \u00b1 2) \u00d7 10\u22126\n\n(3.0 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10\u22124\n(2.8 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10\u22124\n(2.1 \u00b1 0.7) \u00d7 10\u22124\n(3.4 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10\u22124\n(9.9 \u00b1 1.2) \u00d7 10\u22124\n3 \u03c3: < 3.2 \u00d7 10\u22124\n\n(7.3 \u00b1 1.2) \u00d7 10\u22124\n(5.9 \u00b1 1.5) \u00d7 10\u22124\n(5.4 \u00b1 1.6) \u00d7 10\u22124\n(6.6 \u00b1 2.1) \u00d7 10\u22124\n(22.4 \u00b1 3.8) \u00d7 10\u22124\n(4.6 \u00b1 3.3) \u00d7 10\u22124\n\n(2.1 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10\u22126\n(2.0 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10\u22126\n(1.6 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10\u22126\n(2.6 \u00b1 0.7) \u00d7 10\u22126\n(6.6 \u00b1 1.3) \u00d7 10\u22126\n3 \u03c3: < 3.1 \u00d7 10\u22126\n\nNOTE. \u2013 The quoted errors reflect measurement uncertainty in the stacked fluxes.\n\nTABLE 3\nProperties of the Stacks III: Biases and Errors in Stacked Fluxes\n\nSample\nA.\nB.\nC.\nD.\nE.\n\n24 \u03bcm\n1-Bias a / Error\n0.94\n0.94\n0.94\n0.94\n0.95\n\n/\n/\n/\n/\n/\n\nb\n\n100 \u03bcm\n1-Bias a / Error\n\n0.002\n0.003\n0.015\n0.004\n0.009\n\n0.96\n0.95\n0.96\n0.96\n0.95\n\n/\n/\n/\n/\n/\n\n0.012\n0.017\n0.039\n0.035\n0.046\n\nb\n\n160 \u03bcm\n1-Bias a / Error\n0.92\n0.92\n0.92\n0.92\n0.93\n\n/\n/\n/\n/\n/\n\n0.014\n0.022\n0.040\n0.045\n0.058\n\nb\n\n1.4 GHz\n1-Bias a / Error\n1.03\n1.02\n1.03\n1.03\n1.05\n\n/\n/\n/\n/\n/\n\nb\n\n0.016\n0.024\n0.054\n0.038\n0.075\n\na Average bias of stacked flux, defined as the ratio of the mean measured flux to the simulated flux,\n\nhf meas i/f sim .\nb Fractional uncertainty in the mean stacked flux, taken as the ratio of the error in the mean of the\n\u221a\n\u221a\nmeasured stacked flux (\u03c3/ N) to the median measured flux, i.e., \u03c3(f meas )/( N hf meas i).\n\nthe 1 \u03c3 measurement uncertainties in the stacked fluxes.\nThe similarity in flux between the exclusion and noexclusion cases implies that any objects that may cluster around the UV-selected galaxies do not contribute\nsignificantly to the stacked far-infrared fluxes of the UVselected galaxies. We note that there may exist very faint\nsources that are undetected in the optical, near-IR, and\nIRAC data and which may lie close to our targets. However, we consider it unlikely for sources that are faint\nat virtually all other wavelengths (optical, near-IR, and\nthe Spitzer IRAC and MIPS bands) to be bright enough\nat 100 \u03bcm to contribute significantly to the stacked flux\nof the UV-selected galaxies. Performing a similar test\nat 160 \u03bcm is not possible, as the larger FWHM results\nin an exclusion radius that precludes any galaxies from\nbeing stacked. Because the 100 and 160 \u03bcm emission\narises from the same mechanism (dust emission), then\none would conclude that the effects of clustering are unlikely to be significant at 160 \u03bcm if the 100 \u03bcm stacked\nemission yields similar infrared luminosities to those obtained from the stacked 160 \u03bcm data. In Section 4 we\npresent evidence that suggests that an additional contribution to the 160 \u03bcm flux from other sources must\nbe negligible compared to the flux from the UV-selected\ngalaxies of interest here. Based on this evidence, and to\ntake advantage of all the galaxies in our sample, we proceed by adopting the fluxes obtained without using the\nexclusion radius; these values are given in Table 2. Below, we discuss two additional tests used to verify these\nstacked fluxes.\n3.3.2. Comparison with Random Stacks\n\nThe probability of a chance measurement that results\nin fluxes as high as the ones obtained by stacking on the\npositions of UV-selected galaxies (i.e., the target stacks)\n\ncan be determined by stacking at random positions in\nthe images (i.e., random stacks). We performed this random stack test on the radio and 24, 100, and 160 \u03bcm data\n(we did not exclude positions that correspond to detected\nsources). The results for the mid-IR and IR simulations\nfor Sample B (stacking on N = 114 positions) are shown\nin Figure 2. For this sample, the 24 and 100 \u03bcm fluxes\nmeasured for 10,000 random stacks were never as high\nas those obtained for the target stacks. For the 160 \u03bcm\ndata, 15 out of 10,000 random stacks result in fluxes that\nwere within the 1 \u03c3 measurement uncertainty of the target stack. The random stacks indicate a very low probability (. 0.2%) of accidentally recovering stacked fluxes\nas high as the ones observed for the sample of L\u2217 galaxies at z \u223c 2, and these probabilities are consistent with\nthose expected based on the measurement uncertainties\nof the stacked fluxes.\n3.3.3. Stacks of Simulated Galaxies\n\nBuilding on the random stack tests, point sources of\nknown flux density were added at random locations in the\nresidual images (using the same PSFs that are used to\nobtain photometry20 ) and were recovered by a stacking\nanalysis. We added the same number of point sources to\nthe residual images as are used in constructing the stacks\n20 We performed another test to determine if asymmetries in the\nintrinsic Herschel PSF result in systematic differences in the photometry obtained for simulated sources. For this test, we redid the\nsimulations by adding point sources of known flux density, where\nwe assumed the flux profile given by the PACS PSF measured by\nobserving the asteroid Vesta. The sources were then recovered using the PSF measured from the GOODS-N Herschel images. Based\non this second set of simulations, we find less than 5% systematic\noffset between the difference of input and output flux relative to the\ndifference obtained when assuming the same PSF, both for adding\nsources to the images and recovering their fluxes.\n\n\f7\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n20\n\n-200\n\n0\n\n200\n\n0\n-400\n\n0\n\n400\n\nFig. 2.- Comparison of measured stacked fluxes (mean and uncertainty indicated by the solid lines and hashed regions, respectively)\nfor Sample B and the distribution of fluxes obtained by stacking on N = 114 random positions, repeated 10000 times (histograms).\n\nFig. 3.- Distribution of stacked fluxes for artificial galaxies added to the 24, 100, and 160 \u03bcm images (histograms) for Samples A through\nE, relative to the simulated flux (numbers in panels).\n\nfor Samples A through E. Flux densities were assigned\nbased on a Gaussian distribution with a mean equivalent\nto the median stacked flux for each Sample (the stacks\nare insensitive to the dispersion in simulated fluxes). The\nratio of the measured stack to simulated mean flux are\nshown in Figure 3 for the different samples, with numbers and input mean fluxes indicated, for the 24, 100, and\n160 \u03bcm data. This ratio is close to, but not exactly, equal\nto 1, with a bias of just a few percent. The biases and\ndispersions measured for the different stacks are summarized in Table 3. The error in the mean recovered stacked\nflux from the simulations is much smaller than the measurement uncertainty. Therefore, for the subsequent discussion we assume a flux uncertainty that is equal to the\nmeasurement uncertainty of the stacked flux. Finally, we\ncorrected the observed fluxes (listed in Table 2) by the\nbias factors given in Table 3 before inferring the total\ninfrared luminosities, as we discuss in the next section.\n\n3.3.4. Summary of Tests\n\nWe have performed several tests to validate our measures of the stacked fluxes for UV-selected galaxies. The\nmethod employed here is able to recover the stacked\nfluxes of galaxies with a bias of just a few percent relative to the known fluxes of artificial sources added to the\n1.4 GHz, and 24, 100, and 160 \u03bcm images. These tests\nalso imply a very low probability (. 0.2%) of accidentally\nrecovering stacked fluxes that are as high as the target\nstacked fluxes. Finally, we test for the effect of source\nclustering on the stacked flux at 100 \u03bcm. By excluding\ngalaxies from the stack which have any nearby sources,\nwe find that the remaining galaxies have a median flux\nthat is identical within the measurement errors of the\nmedian flux inferred for the entire sample of galaxies.\nThis indicates that any sources that may cluster around\nthe UV-selected galaxies (if they exist) do not affect the\nstacking results.\n\n\f8\n4. INFRARED LUMINOSITIES AND DUST SEDS\n4.1. Dust SED Templates and Extrapolation to the\n\nRadio\nTo infer the total infrared luminosities L(8 \u2212\n1000 \u03bcm) \u2261 LIR of the z \u223c 2 galaxies, we employed\nseveral publicly available dust SED templates including\nthose of Chary & Elbaz (2001) (\"CE01\"), Dale & Helou\n(2002) (\"DH02\"), and Rieke et al. (2009) (\"Rieke+09\").\nWe also include the median templates presented in\nElbaz et al. (2011). Specifically, these authors define an\n\"infrared main sequence\" of galaxies, where the ratio of\nLIR to L8 (IR8) is universal for most star-forming galaxies at z . 2.0, having a value of LIR /L8 = 4.9+2.9\n\u22122.2 . The\n\"infrared starbursts\" are considered to be those galaxies with IR8 ratios in excess of \u2248 15. Elbaz et al. (2011)\ndemonstrate that variations in IR8 may be due primarily\nto differences in the infrared luminosity surface density\nof galaxies, such that main sequence galaxies are characterized by star formation that is more extended than\nthat present in starbursts (see Section 5). We fit the median IR SED of these main sequence (\"Elbaz+11-MS\")\nand starburst galaxies (\"Elbaz+11-SB\") to the stacked\nfluxes.\nThe Reddy et al. (2010) calibration between rest-frame\n8 \u03bcm emission and infrared luminosity is considered as\nwell. In this case, L8 is computed by k-correcting the\n24 \u03bcm flux using the average of 12 local galaxy mid-IR\nSEDs specified in Reddy et al. (2006b). The correlation\nbetween L8 and H\u03b1 luminosity is then used to infer the\nL8 \u2013LIR conversion, based on using H\u03b1 as an independent probe of the star formation (Reddy et al. 2010).\nFinally, we make use of the radio-infrared correlation to\nprovide an independent estimate of LIR , assuming that\nthis relation does not evolve with redshift, as is consistent with the evidence, at least at redshifts z . 3 (e.g.,\nAppleton et al. 2004; Ivison et al. 2010; Sargent et al.\n2010; Bourne et al. 2011; Mao et al. 2011). For the subsequent analysis, we use the radio-infrared correlation\npublished in Bell (2003). The sample of Yun et al. (2001)\nis roughly a factor of 10 larger than the one analyzed\nby Bell (2003). However, Yun et al. (2001) calibrate the\n60 \u03bcm luminosity, L60 , with radio luminosity, and the\nformer requires some assumption about the relation between L60 and LIR . To make the minimum number of\nassumptions, we therefore adopted the Bell (2003) calibration which directly relates the total infrared luminosities to the specific luminosity at 1.4 GHz.\nThe CE01 and Rieke+09 models are parameterized\nsuch that we can relate any template to a given total infrared luminosity. The Elbaz+11-MS/SB templates are\nnormalized to an infrared luminosity of LIR = 1011 L\u2299 .\nThe DH02 models are presented as a function of radiation field intensity and, following the literature (e.g.,\nPapovich et al. 2007), we associate infrared luminosities\nwith each of the DH02 templates assuming the empirical calibration of Marcillac et al. (2006). The CE01 and\nRieke+09 models also include an extrapolation to radio wavelengths by assuming some version of the local\nradio-far-infrared correlation (Condon 1992; Yun et al.\n2001; Bell 2003). For a consistent treatment, we have\nadjusted the models (or added to them, in the case of\nDH02 and Elbaz+11-MS/SB) for a radio spectrum with\nindex \u03b3 = \u22120.8 (Condon 1992), normalized to have a\n\nspecific luminosity at 1.4 GHz corresponding to the LIR\nfor that template, assuming the Bell (2003) calibration.\n4.2. Fitting Procedure\nBecause the far-infrared peak of the dust emission\nin the SED templates shifts to shorter wavelengths at\nhigher luminosities, we can either (1) fit these templates directly to the observed infrared and radio fluxes\n(\"luminosity-matched\" fitting), or (2) find the template\nthat best matches the infrared colors and then normalize this template to the observed fluxes (\"color-matched\"\nfitting). The color-matched fitting yields larger uncertainties in LIR because the color errors are larger than\nthose for individual flux measurements. We have adopted\nboth methods for comparison purposes. The Elbaz+11MS/SB templates are based on the composite IR spectral\nenergy distribution of the \"main sequence\" and \"starburst\" galaxy samples of Elbaz et al. (2011), and are\nnormalized to LIR = 1011 L\u2299 . We assume the same spectral shape (i.e., no color dependence) when fitting these\ntemplates to the observed fluxes. Further, in finding the\nbest-fit template, we include results where all fluxes have\nbeen weighted equally, as well as being weighted by their\nerrors. The equal weighting is done to ensure that the\nhigher S/N 24 \u03bcm data (and thus the smaller measurement uncertainties at 24 \u03bcm) do not unduly skew the\ntemplate fits.\n4.3. Infrared Luminosities\n\nTable 4 lists the LIR corresponding to the best-fit templates for different combinations of the stacked fluxes\nfor Samples A through F, after taking into account the\nbiases and dispersions in these fluxes (see discussion\nabove and Table 3). Fitting for different combinations\nof the infrared and radio data allows us to determine\nif the inclusion of any of the stacked fluxes results in\nsignificant changes in the inferred infrared luminosities.\nAlso included in this table are the results from using\nthe Reddy et al. (2010) calibration between L8 and LIR ,\nand the LIR corresponding radio luminosity assuming the\nBell (2003) radio-IR correlation.\nThe systematic uncertainties in log(LIR ) for the different combinations of templates, fluxes, and fitting methods for each of the subsamples are typically within\n0.1 dex. We note that the LIR derived from 160 \u03bcm is\nnot systematically larger than that inferred from 100 \u03bcm,\nand hence runs counter to what one might expect if\nthe larger 160 \u03bcm beam included more sources clustered\naround the UV-selected galaxies that contribute to the\nmeasured far-infrared flux. The stacked radio data have\nsignificantly higher resolution (\u223c 1.\u2032\u2032 7 at 1.4 GHz versus\n\u223c 11\u2032\u2032 at 160 \u03bcm) and yield a radio flux that implies an\nLIR that is also not any smaller than the value inferred\nfrom the 160 \u03bcm data. Based on this evidence, we conclude that the 160 \u03bcm emission from sources proximate\nto the UV-selected galaxies is negligible compared to the\nemission from the UV-selected galaxies themselves.\nThe notable outliers listed in Table 4 are the LIR determined from 24 \u03bcm flux density alone, which tend to\noverpredict LIR , particularly for the highest luminosity\nsubsamples D and E, relative to cases where we include\nthe 100 and 160 \u03bcm data in most of the template fits\n(Figure 4). Alternatively, with the Elbaz+11-MS template, 24 \u03bcm-only determinations result in systematically\n\n\f9\n\nTABLE 4\nComparison of Infrared Luminosities (LIR )\nTemplate\nR10a\n\n\u03bb,

Error\nbars reflect the uncertainty in the LIR inferred from the stacked\nmeasurements, except for the high luminosity subsample (Sample\nE), where the errors include the intrinsic dispersion in 24 \u03bcm fluxes\nof objects that contribute to the sample. For clarity, error bars are\nnot shown for the Elbaz+11-MS/SB points.\n\nlower LIR . These differences are due to the intrinsic variation in the ratio of L8 to LIR luminosity present in\nthe templates relative to the observed SED. The systematic overestimation of LIR based on L8 alone has been\nnoted before for ultraluminous infrared galaxies studied with Spitzer (Papovich et al. 2007; Daddi et al. 2007;\nPapovich et al. 2009; Murphy et al. 2011; Magnelli et al.\n2011) and Herschel (Nordon et al. 2010; Elbaz et al.\n2010). For the samples considered here, the same 24 \u03bcm\nbias is apparent for all templates (except for Elbaz+11MS) even at LIRG luminosities, where the difference between the best-fit LIR and that determined from 24 \u03bcm\nalone is similar to the 1 \u03c3 uncertainties in LIR .\nUsing Spitzer and Herschel data for galaxies at redshifts z . 2.0, Elbaz et al. (2011) investigate the physical reasons for the overestimation of LIR based on restframe L8 alone. These authors point out that the SED\ntemplates used to infer LIR are calibrated to match local\nULIRGs, which are starbursts with compact, high surface density star formation. This contrasts with ULIRGs\nat high redshift (z & 2.0) which have more extended star\nformation occuring over longer timescales. These differences in star formation surface densities and timescales\nlead to noticeable differences in the IR SEDs because\nof the variations in the spatial distribution of dust with\nrespect to the massive stars that are heating this dust.\nIn Section 5, we discuss the LIR /L8 ratios found here\nand place them in the context of the ratios found for\nother star-forming galaxies with similar luminosities but\nat lower redshifts.\nWe conclude by noting that the Reddy et al. (2010)\ncalibration, which is based on the correlation between\nL8 and dust-corrected H\u03b1 luminosity at z \u223c 2, predicts LIR for LIRGs that are similar within the errors\nto those computed using the combined Spitzer, Herschel,\n\nFig.\n5.- Comparison of the Chary & Elbaz (2001),\nDale & Helou (2002), Rieke et al.

The total infrared\nluminosities for the three templates are identical within the uncertainties (Table 4).\n\nand VLA data. Finally, the infrared luminosities based\non the radio data alone are in excellent agreement with\nthe infrared luminosities inferred from fitting the dust\ntemplates to the observed 24, 100, and 160 \u03bcm fluxes.\n4.4. Comparison of Dust SEDs\n\nFigure 5 compares the dust SEDs found for the\nluminosity-matched fitting to the 24, 100, and 160 \u03bcm,\nand 1.4 GHz data, weighted by their errors. The dust\nSEDs for the different models are broadly consistent\nwith each other; one difference is in the stronger silicate absorption at 9 \u03bcm and additional aromatic features longward of 10 \u03bcm in the Rieke+09 model fit. The\nRieke+09 templates are calibrated using Spitzer/IRS\nspectra, rather than photometry, between 5 and 36 \u03bcm,\nand will understandably include mid-IR spectral features\nthat are not present in the other models.\nThe most notable difference between the templates can\nbe seen in Figure 5: the Elbaz+11 and DH02 templates\nexhibit a broader range of dust temperatures with a\ncolder dust component, relative to CE01 and Rieke+09.\nResolving the full shape of the SED, and the average dust\ntemperatures, will require larger stacked samples and\ndeeper data in the submillimeter and millimeter regime.\nIn any case, while some obvious differences remain between the model templates given the data at our disposal,\nthe integrals of these SEDs, namely the total LIR , are essentially identical within the uncertainties (Table 4). For\nthe subsequent analysis, we assume the LIR determined\nfrom the DH02 model that best fits the error-weighted\nfluxes at 1.4 GHz, 24, 100, and 160 \u03bcm. Assuming the\nLIR derived using any of the other models does not affect our conclusions.\n4.5. The Dust SED of Typical Star-Forming Galaxies at\n\nz\u223c2\nThe average stellar population and dust SEDs for L\u2217UV\ngalaxies at z \u223c 2 are shown in Figure 6.

(2010) based on an analysis of the\n24 \u03bcm, H\u03b1, and UV emission for UV-selected galaxies at\nz \u223c 2. We also point out that the median value of LIR for\nL\u2217UV galaxies is similar (to within a factor of \u2248 3) to the\nvalue of L\u2217IR deduced from direct Spitzer determinations\nof the IR LF at z \u223c 2 (Magnelli et al. 2011).\nThe necessity of stacking the UV-selected galaxies,\neven for GOODS-depth Herschel PACS data, is illustrated in Figure 7. Typical L\u2217 galaxies at z \u223c 2 are easily detected at wavelengths blueward of observed 24 \u03bcm\ngiven the depths of the data considered here. Redward\nof this point, however, the dust emission is not sufficient\nfor directly detecting these galaxies, thus stacking in the\ninfrared and radio bands is required. Fortunately, the\nHerschel PACS sensivity and resolution are such that\nwe can for the first time significantly detect the average\nthermal emission of non-lensed L\u2217 galaxies at z \u223c 2.\n4.6. Variation of LIR with UV Slope and Bolometric\n\nLuminosity\nThe stacks for the different subsamples indicate that\ngalaxies with bluer UV spectral slopes are on average\n\nFig. 7.- Detections limits (3 \u03c3) for the ground-based optical (Un GR), ground-based near-IR (JKs ), Spitzer/IRAC (3.6 \u2212\n8.0 \u03bcm), Spitzer/MIPS (24 \u03bcm), Herschel/PACS (100, 160 \u03bcm),\nand VLA 1.4 GHz data in the GOODS-North field, relative to the\nSED of an L\u2217 galaxy at z \u223c 2.\n\nless infrared luminous than those with red UV spectral\nslopes (Table 4). This systematic effect is approximately\nequal in magnitude to the uncertainties in the stacked\nflux measurements. Not surprisingly, those galaxies that\nare inferred to have Lbol \u2265 1012 L\u2299 based on the MIPS\n24 \u03bcm data (Sample E; Table 4) have median stacked\nfluxes at 100 and 160 \u03bcm that are a factor of 3 \u2212 4 times\nlarger than the corresponding fluxes for the L\u2217 sample.\nThe median infrared luminosity for Sample E is not as\nlarge as that computed from 24 \u03bcm alone and hence not\n\n\f12\nas large as the value of Lbol used to construct this subsample (e.g., Figure 4). However, the best-fit template\nto the mid-IR, IR, and radio fluxes indicates that galaxies in Sample E are still more infrared luminous than\ngalaxies in other subsamples. These galaxies correspond\nto low-luminosity ULIRGs or higher luminosity LIRGs.\nIn the next section, we compare the infrared and UV\nluminosities for each of the subsamples of UV-selected\ngalaxies.\n5. DISCUSSION\n\nIn the following, we discuss our results on L\u2217 galaxies\nat z \u223c 2 in the context of the infrared properties of starforming galaxies with similar luminosities at lower redshifts. We then discuss the combined UV and IR luminosity measurements for z \u223c 2 galaxies and the implication for their average dust attenuation. We also compare\nthe measured dust attenuation with that inferred from\nthe local correlation between dustiness and UV slope.\nFinally, we use the Herschel data to determine the median bolometric luminosities and star formation rates of\ngalaxies in our sample, the correlation between bolometric luminosity and dust attenuation, and the variation in\ndust attenuation with UV luminosity.\n5.1. Ratio of Infrared to Mid-Infrared Luminosity\n\nFor a consistent comparison with Elbaz et al. (2011),\nwe have recomputed L8 using the mid-IR SED of M82 to\nk-correct the 24 \u03bcm flux. The implied k-corrections are\nnot substantially different than those obtained from the\naverage mid-IR SED of the 12 local star-forming galaxies\nlisted in Reddy et al. (2006b). Adopting the CE01 luminosity matched and weighted value of LIR , we compute\nIR8 = 7.7\u00b11.6, 8.9\u00b11.3, 8.3\u00b12.4, 8.9\u00b11.4, and 8.4\u00b10.5,\nfor Samples A, B, C, D, and E, respectively. Assuming\nthe LIR computed from the 100 and 160 \u03bcm data only results in ratios that are not significantly different than the\nones quoted above. These values imply that the galaxies\nin our sample predominantly lie on the boundary between the ratios found for infrared main sequence galaxies (IR8= 4.9+2.9\n\u22122.2 ), and those found for starburst galaxies\nwhich have an exponential tail distribution extending to\nIR8 = 15 \u2212 20. The relatively high IR8 ratios also may\nexplain why the typically-adopted templates (e.g., CE01)\ntend to not fail as badly for galaxies in our sample relative to more luminous ULIRGs at z \u223c 2 when inferring\nLIR from L8 alone (e.g., Reddy et al. 2006b, 2010).\nA detailed comparison between the morphologies of the\nz \u223c 2 galaxies studied here and local star-forming galaxies is beyond the scope of this paper. However, we can\nstill make some general inferences regarding the degree of\n\"compactness\" of the IR emission in these galaxies and\nhow it may affect their IR8 ratios. We compute the IR\nluminosity surface density following Elbaz et al. (2011):\n\u03a3IR \u2261\n\nLIR /2\n2 .\n\u03c0rIR\n\n(1)\n\nThe typical UV half-light radius of galaxies in our sample is rUV \u2243 2 kpc. If we assume that the IR halflight radius is roughly half this value, as suggested by\nElbaz et al. (2011), then rIR \u2248 1 kpc, implying \u03a3IR \u2248\n3 \u00d7 1010 L\u2299 kpc\u22122 . On the other hand, if rIR \u2248 rUV\nas might be expected for galaxies at high redshift where\n\nthe UV emission is dominated by OB stars, then \u03a3IR \u2248\n8 \u00d7 109 L\u2299 kpc\u22122 . Even this lower value is a factor of 4\nlarger than the \u03a3IR . 2 \u00d7 109 L\u2299 kpc\u22122 typical of the\ninfrared main sequence galaxies with extended star formation in the Elbaz et al. (2011) sample. The relevance\nfor the present discussion is that while L\u2217 galaxies at\nz \u223c 2.3 appear to have IR8 ratios that are a factor of \u2248 2\nlarger than for main sequence galaxies at lower redshifts,\nthey also exhibit \u03a3IR that are larger than those found\nfor main sequence galaxies, and hence are more compact\nfor their IR luminosity. Formally, galaxies in our sample\nwould lie on the \"boundary\" between IR main sequence\nand IR starburst galaxies. These larger IR8 ratios result\nin the over-prediction of LIR based on L8 alone when\nusing the standard templates, as noted in Section 4.\nOne possibility is that the IR8 ratio for typical starforming (L\u2217 ) galaxies may evolve with redshift, transitioning from IR8 \u2243 4.9 at z . 2.0 to IR8 \u2243 8 at z \u223c 2.3.\nThis effect is likely due to the smaller sizes of high redshift galaxies for their IR luminosities relative to lower\nredshift galaxies. Finally, it is worth noting that the\nstar formation rate surface density appears to be roughly\nconstant for L\u2217 galaxies at higher redshifts (z \u223c 4 \u2212 7;\n\u03a3SFR \u2243 1.9 M\u2299 yr\u22121 kpc\u22122 ; e.g., Oesch et al. 2010), suggesting that there may be a similar commonality in the\nIR8 ratios (if one could measure them) for typical starforming galaxies at very high redshift, just as is observed\nfor main sequence galaxies at z . 2.0 (Elbaz et al. 2011).\n5.2. Dust Obscuration of Typical Star-Forming Galaxies\n\nat z \u223c 2\n5.2.1. Definitions Relevant to Dust Obscuration\n\nBefore proceeding, it is useful to define several terms\nthat have been typically used interchangeably in the\nliterature. First, we define \"dust obscuration\", or attenuation, as LIR /LUV . Note that this ratio is not\nequivalent to the ratio of obscured to unobscured star\nformation rate, SFRIR /SFRUV , given the difference in\nscaling required to convert the UV and IR luminosities to star formation rates. We also define the \"dust\ncorrection factor\" needed to recover the total star formation rate from that computed based on the unobscured UV luminosity as (SFRIR +SFRUV )/SFRUV \u2261 1+\nSFRIR /SFRUV . For the L\u2217 sample, the median dust obscuration is LIR /LUV = 7.1\u00b11.1, the ratio of obscured to\nunobscured SFR is SFRIR /SFRUV = 4.2 \u00b1 0.6, and the\ndust correction factor is 5.2 \u00b1 0.6. The LUV , LIR , ratio\nof obscured to unobscured SFR, and total SFR for each\nsubsample are listed in Table 5. For the conversion to\nSFR, we assume a Salpeter (1955) initial mass function\nwith limits from 0.1 to 100 M\u2299 and the Kennicutt (1998)\nconversions betweeen UV/IR luminosity and SFR. The\nresults indicate that roughly 80% of the star formation\nis obscured for L\u2217 galaxies at z \u223c 2.\nThe dust obscuration varies between LIR /LUV = 4.8 \u00b1\n1.0 for the subsample with blue UV slopes (Sample C)\nand LIR /LUV = 10.7\u00b11.9 for the subsample with red UV\nslopes (Sample D), and is as high as LIR /LUV \u2248 37.7\u00b17.9\nfor the most bolometrically-luminous galaxies (Sample\nE). These observations imply a trend in dustiness with\nboth UV slope and bolometric luminosity.\n5.2.2.

For the\n\"young\" subsample (Sample F), we multiply the UV SFR determined from the Kennicutt (1998)\nrelation by a factor of 2. This is done to account for the fact that the mix of O and B stars\ncontributing to the UV continuum emission has not equilibrated for ages . 100 Myr (assuming\na constant star formation); thus, the Kennicutt (1998) conversion between UV luminosity and\nSFR will underpredict the total SFR for such \"young\" galaxies.\n\nIn particular, we show the dust obscuration derived\nfor these samples as a function of UV slope, \u03b2, in Figure 8. Up to luminosities of LIR \u2248 1012 L\u2299 , we find\nthat galaxies with redder \u03b2 are on average dustier. Furthermore, the correlation between dustiness and UV\nslope is essentially identical to that found for local starburst galaxies (Meurer et al. 1999; Calzetti et al. 2000).\nThis result has been found by several other investigations targeting moderately luminous galaxies and\nusing a variety of star formation tracers at z \u223c 2\n(e.g., Reddy & Steidel 2004; Reddy et al. 2006b, 2010;\nDaddi et al. 2007; Pannella et al. 2009) and z \u223c 3 (e.g.,\nSeibert et al. 2002; Nandra et al. 2002; Magdis et al.\n2010a,b).\nInfrared selection, e.g., such as 24 \u03bcm selection, generally results in samples where the bulk of galaxies do not\nabide by the Meurer et al. (1999) or Calzetti et al. (2000)\nattenuation curves (e.g., Murphy et al. 2011). As discussed in Reddy et al. (2006b) and Reddy et al. (2010),\nthe correlation between UV slope and dust attenuation breaks down for more infrared luminous galaxies at\nz \u223c 2, as well as younger galaxies with ages . 100 Myr\nat the same redshifts, where the latter tend to follow a\nsteeper attenuation curve (i.e., they are less reddened at a\ngiven UV slope than predicted by the Meurer et al. 1999\nrelation). Systematic deviations from the local starburst\nattenuation curve have also been observed at lower redshift (z . 2) based on Herschel/PACS and SPIRE data\n(e.g., Buat et al. 2010; Burgarella et al. 2011) and Akari\ndata (Buat et al. 2011).\nMuch of the aforementioned deviation from the local\nstarburst attenuation curve can be understood in the\ncontext of the range of bolometric luminosity probed by\nthe different UV and IR selections. UV color selection is\nsensitive to galaxies with moderate (L\u2217 ) luminosities and\nlower dust extinction than those selected in the infrared.\nBecause dust attenuation is a strong function of bolometric luminosity and the validity of the Meurer et al.\n(1999) relation is luminosity dependent (Meurer et al.\n1999; Goldader et al. 2002; Reddy et al. 2006b, 2010),\nit is natural to expect departures from this relation for\n\nFig. 8.- Mean dust attenuation (LIR /LUV ) versus UV slope\n(\u03b2) for different subsamples of z \u223c 2 galaxies. Also shown are\nattenuation curves for the SMC and for local UV starbursts from\nMeurer et al. (1999), and the 3 \u03c3 upper limit and stacked 24 \u03bcm\nimplied value (cyan point) of the dust attenuation for the youngest\ngalaxies in our sample.\n\ngalaxies that may be selected via their infrared emission.\nDeviations may also be observed in infrared luminous\ngalaxies that also have large stellar masses; in this case,\nthe UV continuum associated with the massive OB stars\nmay be extinguished relative the UV emission from less\nmassive stars, resulting in a redder UV continuum slope\nfor a given dust obscuration (e.g., Murphy et al. 2011;\nBuat et al. 2010). These results stress that one must\ntake care in applying any starburst attenuation curve\nto high redshift galaxies, with the realization that such\nrelations may apply in one regime but fail in another depending on the properties of the galaxies in one's sample.\nHere, we have shown that galaxies that lie around L\u2217 of\nthe UV luminosity function have dust obscuration \u2013 as\nmeasured from Spitzer, Herschel, and VLA data \u2013 that\ncorrelate with their UV slopes, and that this correlation\nis similar to that observed for local starburst galaxies.\n\n\f14\nThe stacked Herschel data do not directly indicate the\nintrinsic dispersion in the relation between UV slope and\ndustiness. However, an indirect estimate of this scatter\ncomes from an analysis of the 24 \u03bcm data. Specifically,\n109 of 311 galaxies in the larger (and multiple field) sample of Reddy et al. (2010) are detected at 24 \u03bcm. Using\na survival analysis to take into account both detections\nand non-detections, Reddy et al. (2010) found a dispersion of \u2248 0.40 dex between dust attenuation, LIR /LUV ,\nand rest-UV slope, \u03b2. If the scatter in the L8 -to-LIR ratio\nis similar to that found by Elbaz et al. (2011) for lower\nredshift (z . 2.0) galaxies with LIR . 1012 L\u2299 (having a\n1 \u03c3 dispersion of \u2248 0.1 dex), then the implied total dispersion in the relation between dustiness and UV slope is\n\u2248 0.45 dex. The correspondence between LIR /LUV and \u03b2\nto within a factor of \u2248 3 thus verifies the applicability of\nthe Meurer et al. (1999) and Calzetti et al. (2000) attenuation curves for galaxies with LIR . 1012 L\u2299 at z \u223c 2.\nThe UV attenuation curve is sensitive primarily to the\ngeometry of dust and stars within galaxies, and/or variations in dust composition. Hence, the correspondence\nof the UV attenuation curves between local starbursts\nand z \u223c 2 L\u2217 galaxies implies a remarkable similarily in\nthe processes that give rise to the spatial distribution of\ndust and stars and the dust composition in galaxies over\n\u2248 10 billion years of cosmic history.\n5.3. Comparison with Recent Studies\n\nUsing the Herschel data to directly probe the thermal\ndust emission, we have shown that the local correlation\nbetween UV slope and dust obscuration remains valid for\ntypical star-forming galaxies at z \u223c 2. In the following,\nwe compare our results with several recent studies of the\ndust attenuation of high redshift galaxies.\n5.3.1. Radio Emission from UV-selected Galaxies\n\nCarilli et al. (2008) stack the radio emission of z \u223c\n3 LBGs in the COSMOS field and deduce that\nSFRradio /SFRUV = 1.8 \u00b1 0.4, where SFRradio is derived\nusing the calibration of Yun et al. (2001). This calibration is based on equating the local star formation rate\ndensity with the integral of the radio luminosity function,\nso in this case the radio SFR should represent a total SFR\n(but see below), including obscured and unobscured components. The factor of 1.8 from the Carilli et al. (2008)\nstudy is significantly smaller than the factor of \u2248 5 computed for our UV-selected sample at z \u223c 2.\nCarilli et al. (2008) discuss several possibilities for the\nsuppression of radio flux with respect to SFR at z \u223c 3.\nFor a consistent comparison, we assess their results using the same calibration used in this analysis. In particular, we employ the Bell (2003) correlation between\ntotal infrared luminosity (LIR ) and specific luminosity\nat 1.4 GHz. Doing so, the stacked median radio luminosity of LBGs in the COSMOS field, L1.4 = 5.1 \u00d7\n1029 erg s\u22121 Hz\u22121 , corresponds to LIR \u2248 2.2 \u00d7 1011 L\u2299 .\nThese values are essentially identical to those determined\nfor our L\u2217 sample at z \u223c 2: L1.4 = (5.2 \u00b1 1.0) \u00d7\n1029 erg s\u22121 Hz\u22121 and LIR = (2.2 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 1011 L\u2299 (Table 4). The obscured SFR corresponding to the LIR\nfor the COSMOS LBGs, assuming the Kennicutt (1998)\nrelation, is \u2248 38 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . Hence, the factor that we\ncompute to recover the total star formation rate from\n\nthe UV star formation for the Carilli et al. (2008) sample, assuming their value of the unobscured SFR of\n17 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , is 1 + 38/17 \u2248 3.2. This is close to a factor\nof two larger than the value of 1.8 given in Carilli et al.\n(2008). This discrepancy results from the fact that while\nthe Yun et al. (2001) correlation between radio luminosity and star formation rate gives a star formation rate\nthat is in good agreement with that inferred from LIR\n(SFR \u2243 38 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ), it underestimates the total SFR\n(SFRIR +SFRUV ) of \u2243 55 M\u2299 yr\u22121 .\nTo illustrate this point, we plot in Figure 9 the relationship between total star formation rate and infrared\nluminosity, adopting the Kennicutt (1998) conversions\nbetween UV/IR luminosity and star formation rate, for\nthe sample of 392 z \u223c 2 galaxies of Reddy et al. (2010),\nand for the local samples of Bell (2003) and Huang et al.\n(2009). The top axis in Figure 9 indicates the radio luminosity that corresponds to LIR assuming the Yun et al.\n(2001) calibration, and the solid line shows the relationship between radio luminosity and star formation rate\nderived in that study. The Yun et al. (2001) calibration\nis valid if most of the star formation is obscured, as is\nthe case for ULIRGs at both z \u223c 2 and z \u223c 0. However,\na substantial fraction of the LIRGs in the z \u223c 2 sample have a significant contribution from unobscured star\nformation, where the unobscured component is at least\n50% of the obscured star formation. The same is true\nfor the COSMOS LBG sample of Carilli et al. (2008).\nThe ratio of obscured to unobscured star formation rate\nis a strong function of total star formation rate or bolometric luminosity (e.g., Figure 9; Reddy et al. 2010), and\nthe UV component obviously cannot be neglected for objects that have significant UV emission. Figure 9 shows\nthat one would significantly underestimate the total star\nformation rate of LIRGs at z \u223c 2 based on their IR emission alone (the Kennicutt 1998 relation between SFR and\nLIR is only valid in the optically thick limit), or based\non using the Yun et al. (2001) relationship between radio\nluminosity and star formation rate.\nNote also that Carilli et al. (2008) combine the median\nradio SFR with the mean unobscured UV SFR to determine the effect of dust. In general, mean luminosities will\nbe larger than median ones for a population drawn from\na Schechter (1976) luminosity function, modulo sample\nincompleteness. For our L\u2217 sample, the mean UV luminosity is about 15% larger than the median. More\nimportantly, the mean unobscured UV luminosity of the\nCarilli et al. (2008) sample of 17 M\u2299 yr\u22121 is about a factor of two larger than the median UV SFR for our L\u2217\nsample of \u2248 8.5 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . It is possible that the relatively UV-bright LBGs of the Carilli et al. (2008) sample\nare somewhat less attenuated than more typical (and less\nUV-luminous) LBGs at z \u223c 2\u22123, though this is contrary\nto what has been found for UV-selected galaxies at these\nredshifts (Reddy et al. 2010). Without further analysis\nof their candidates, we conclude that the lower UV obscuration factor deduced by Carilli et al. (2008) is likely due\nto the brighter unobscured UV luminosity of their candidates, relative to the obscured star formation. What is\nclear from our spectroscopic sample is that the stacked\nradio flux for UV-selected galaxies at z \u223c 2 predicts an\nLIR that is identical to that obtained using direct measurements of thermal dust emission from the Herschel\ndata, and this value of LIR implies a dust correction of a\n\n\f15\nlation for typical star-forming galaxies at high redshift; it\nsimply means that the rest-frame UV slope also becomes\nbluer, on average, for UV-faint galaxies, as the empirical evidence seems to indicate at z \u223c 2.5 (Bouwens et al.\n2009). What is clear from the present analysis is that\nthe direct measurements of the thermal dust emission of\nUV-selected galaxies at z \u223c 2 imply that the local UV\nattenuation curve remains valid for these galaxies.\n5.3.3. Stacked Herschel/SPIRE Measurements for z \u223c 2\nUV-selected Galaxies\n\nFig. 9.- Total star formation rate versus infrared luminosity (LIR ) for the sample of 392 UV-selected z \u223c 2 galaxies of\nReddy et al. (2010) (red circles and orange upper limits), and the\nlocal samples of Bell (2003) and Huang et al. (2009) (dark green\ncircles). The top axis shows the radio luminosity that corresponds\nto LIR assuming the radio-IR correlation of Yun et al. (2001), and\nthe solid line denotes the relationship between radio luminosity and\nstar formation rate derived in that study. The shaded region covers\nthe area where the unobscured star formation is at least 50% of the\nobscured star formation. The large open star denotes the position\nof the COSMOS LBGs from Carilli et al. (2008).\n\nfactor of \u2248 5.\n5.3.2. Investigations of the Extragalactic Background Light\n(EBL)\n\nA second and more recent study that has suggested\nobscuration factors that are different from those predicted from the Meurer et al. (1999) relation comes from\nan analysis of the infrared background based on stacked\nSpitzer and BLAST data by Chary & Pope (2010).\nThese authors estimate the extragalactic background\nlight (EBL) contributed from galaxies at z & 1 and\nconclude that the UV-based dust corrections for typical\nstar-forming galaxies (e.g., those selected by their UV\nemission) must be lower than the Meurer et al. (1999)\nprediction in order that their integrated emission does\nnot violate the background light constraints. However,\ndirectly probing the thermal dust emission of L\u2217 galaxies\nat z \u223c 2, as we have done here, shows conclusively that\nthese galaxies have dust attenuations that are similar,\non average, to those computed based on the Meurer et al.\n(1999) and Calzetti et al. (2000) attenuation curves (Figure 8). How can we reconcile these two results?\nThe EBL is sensitive to the average dust attenuation\nof all galaxies, not just the UV-bright ones studied here.\nIndeed, Reddy & Steidel (2009) and Reddy et al. (2010)\nuse physical arguments and stacked Spitzer data to show\nthat the dust obscuration of UV-faint galaxies is lower\nthan in UV-bright ones (see also next section), and that\nthis luminosity dependence implies that the average dust\nobscuration, integrated over the entire luminosity function, can be close to a factor of two lower than the mean\ndust obscuration found for just the UV bright galaxies\n(see Table 5 of Reddy & Steidel 2009). This does not\nnecessarily imply a failure of the Meurer et al. (1999) re-\n\nStrong source confusion in the Herschel/SPIRE 250,\n350 and 500 \u03bcm data make it very difficult to carry out\nstacking experiments capable of reaching flux limits as\nfaint as those we expect for L\u2217 UV-selected galaxies at\nz \u223c 2 (approximately 1 mJy \u2013 see Figure 6). After some\nexperimentation, we have chosen not to include those\ndata in our analysis. Nevertheless, Rigopoulou et al.\n(2010) stack SPIRE 250 \u03bcm data for a smaller sample of brighter, 24 \u03bcm-detected, UV-selected galaxies at\nz \u223c 2. These were taken from the sample of Reddy et al.\n(2006a), also used here, but were limited to a 69 objects with individual 24 \u03bcm detections. That subsample\nis therefore likely to be more IR-luminous, on average,\nthan the larger sample considered here, where individual detection at 24 \u03bcm is not required. Rigopoulou et al.\n(2010) measure a stacked 250 \u03bcm flux of f250 = 2.7 \u00b1\n0.8 mJy, corresponding to a total infrared luminosity\nLIR \u2248 4.2 \u00d7 1011 L\u2299 at hzi \u2248 2.21 This value is similar to what we predict at 250 \u03bcm when we stack the\n100 and 160 \u03bcm data for the same set of galaxies (i.e.,\nthe brighter objects with individual 24 \u03bcm detections).\nGiven that we have (1) controlled for issues of clustering\nand confusion at 100 \u03bcm, and cross-checked the 160 \u03bcm\nfluxes with those obtained at 100 \u03bcm, and (2) performed\ndetailed simulations to demonstrate the robustness of\nthe stacked fluxes (Section 3), we believe the PACS constraints on the median IR SED to be robust. With the\nPACS data we are able to constrain the median IR SED\nfor L\u2217 galaxies with lower average infrared luminosities,\nirrespective of whether they are individually detected at\n24 \u03bcm. Future observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) should provide higher resolution\nand more sensitive observations of the Rayleigh-Jeans\nemission from typical star-forming galaxies at high redshift.\n5.4. Dependence of Dust Attenuation on Stellar\n\nPopulation Age and Luminosity\n5.4.1. Galaxies with \"Young\" (. 100 Myr) Stellar\nPopulation Ages\n\nRoughly 14% of the galaxies in our entire sample are\nidentified as having a \"young\" stellar population with inferred ages of . 100 Myr.

The implied 3 \u03c3 upper limit to the\ndust obscuration suggests that these galaxies follow an\n21 We note that the stacked 250 \u03bcm flux shown in Figure 2 of\nRigopoulou et al. (2010) appears to be nearly 10\u00d7 fainter than the\nvalue cited in the text. The authors state that they derive a total\ninfrared luminosity LIR = (1.5\u00b10.5)\u00d71011 L\u2299 using the CE01 dust\ntemplates, but we are unable to reproduce this, finding instead a\nluminosity that is 2.8\u00d7 larger, based on the value f250 = 2.7 mJy\ncited in the text.\n\n\f16\n\nFig. 10.- Left: Bolometric luminosity, Lbol \u2261 LIR + LUV , as a function of LIR /LUV for a sample of local galaxies from Bell (2003)\nand Huang et al.

The relationship between Lbol and LIR /LUV for Samples A, C, D, and E, based\non the stacked Herschel, Spitzer, and VLA data, are denoted by the large filled squares (error bars are not shown for clarity).

(1999) and Calzetti et al. (2000) attenuation curves (Figure 8), in the sense that they exhibit\na redder UV slope for a given obscuration. More stringent constraints on the dust attenuation of these galaxies\ncomes from their stacked 24 \u03bcm emission. Assuming the\nDH02 template that best matches the median 24 \u03bcm flux\nof the \"young\" galaxies implies LIR /LUV \u2248 1.55 \u00b1 0.35.\nThe median UV slope of these galaxies of \u03b2 = \u22121.30\nthen implies that their dust obscurations are consistent\nwith the SMC attenuation curve. The deviation of such\nyoung, high-redshift galaxies from the standard attenuation curve is a result first noted in Reddy et al. (2006b)\nand further investigated in Reddy et al. (2010). IRS\nspectrocopy of a couple of young lensed LBGs provide additional evidence that such young galaxies are less dusty\nat a given UV slope (Siana et al. 2008, 2009) than their\nolder and more typical counterparts at the same redshifts\n(Reddy et al. 2010).\nThe small carbonaceous dust grains giving rise to the\nmid-IR emission are believed to be produced in AGB\nstars over a longer timescale than the Type II SNe responsible for the large grains that emit thermally in the\ninfrared (e.g., Galliano et al. 2008). It is therefore relevant to ask whether evolution in the small-to-large dust\ngrain ratio may be responsible for the observed differences in attenuation curve with stellar population age.\nBased on an X-ray stacking analysis and an examination of the theoretical PAH metallicity from dust models, Reddy et al. (2010) argued that the small-to-large\ndust grain ratio is unlikely to change significantly over\nthe relatively narrow range in metallicity probed by the\nUV-selected sample. IRS spectroscopy of at least a couple of young lensed LBGs at high-redshift also indicates\nthat their ratios of mid-to-far IR emission are similar\nto those found for local starburst galaxies (Siana et al.\n\n2008, 2009) and similar to the ratios observed for z \u223c 2\ngalaxies (Reddy et al. 2006b, 2010). The Herschel observations, which probe the thermal dust emission at z \u223c 2,\nare consistent with these findings based on 24 \u03bcm emission alone.\nIf the difference in attenuation curve is due purely to\ngeometrical effects, then it suggests that the dust covering fraction of high-redshift galaxies evolves significantly\nwith time. A possible simple scenario is one in which the\nfirst generation of stars quickly pollutes the ISM with\ndust and metals over a dynamical timescale of a few tens\nof millions of years, at which point much of the dust is\nforeground to the stars and the dust covering fraction\nis high. As star formation proceeds and either becomes\nspatially extended or is able to drive outflows sufficient\nin momentum to perturb the dust/gas distribution of the\nISM, the resulting attenuation becomes patchier. So, we\nmight expect in this situation that galaxies would gradually transition from a steep attenuation curve like that\nof the SMC to a grayer starburst attenuation curve (e.g.,\nMeurer et al. 1999; Calzetti et al. 2000; see also discussion in Buat et al. 2011). Detailed studies of the variation of the interstellar absorption lines (as a proxy for\nthe dust covering fraction) with dust attenuation will be\nneeded to test this scenario.\n5.4.2. Variation in Dust Attenuation with Bolometric and\nUV Luminosity\n\nMIPS 24 \u03bcm studies have shown that z \u223c 2 galaxies follow a tight trend between bolometric luminosity\nand dust attenuation (e.g., Reddy et al. 2010 and references therein), similar to that observed locally and at\nz \u223c 1 (Burgarella et al. 2009; Buat et al. 2007, 2009;\nWang & Heckman 1996). However, the normalization\nof this trend depends on redshift, such that at a given\nbolometric luminosity, galaxies at high redshift are on\naverage less dusty than local ones (Reddy et al. 2006b,\n\n\f17\n2008, 2010). This result is not unique to our UV-selected\nsample. Rest-frame optical, near-IR, and submillimeter\nselected galaxies at z \u223c 2 also show a similar offset in\nobscuration per unit star formation compared with local galaxies (Reddy et al. 2006b). Reddy et al. (2010)\ndemonstrate that this relationship is likely driven by\nmetallicity evolution. The stacked Herschel and radio\ndata confirm these previous results (Figure 10). This is\nnot surprising given the similarity in LIR and dust attenuation inferred in this study with those inferred for\nL\u2217 galaxies based on 24 \u03bcm data alone. The combined\nHerschel, Spitzer, and VLA data confirm that L\u2217UV galaxies at z \u223c 2 are a factor of \u2248 10 less dusty than galaxies\nwith similar bolometric luminosities in the local universe.\nSimilarly, L\u2217UV galaxies at z \u223c 2 are a factor of \u2248 20 \u2212 30\ntimes more bolometrically-luminous than local galaxies\nwith a similar dust obscuration (Figure 10). These evolutionary effects can also be seen in Figure 9. In the\nlocal universe, it is only for galaxies with LIR . 1011 L\u2299\n(i.e., galaxies fainter than LIRGs) where the unobscured\nstar formation begins to contribute significantly to the\ntotal star formation rate. In contrast, most lower luminosity LIRGs at z \u223c 2 have a significant fraction of\nunobscured star formation, as indicated by the plume of\nz \u223c 2 galaxies extending away from the SFRbol =SFRIR\nline in Figure 9, indicating that LIRGs at z \u223c 2 are more\nUV-transparent relative to LIRGs in the local Universe.\nFinally, we note that Reddy et al. (2010) use a 24 \u03bcm\nanalysis of a larger sample of UV-selected galaxies at z \u223c\n2 to show that the fraction of 24 \u03bcm detections of these\ngalaxies decreases by a factor of two proceeding from UVbright (LUV \u2248 1011 L\u2299 ) to UV-faint (LUV \u2248 1010 L\u2299 )\ngalaxies (see Figure 14 in Reddy et al. 2010). This UV\nluminosity trend in 24 \u03bcm detection fraction implies that\nUV-faint galaxies are on average less infrared-luminous\nthan their UV-bright counterparts, a result that is further confirmed by stacking the 24 \u03bcm emission of galaxies in bins of UV luminosity. A stacking of the combined\nSpitzer, Herschel and VLA data as a function of UV luminosity shows a similar trend, indicating that UV-faint\ngalaxies are also less bolometrically luminous than UVbright galaxies (Figure 10). The actual dust attenuation,\nLIR /LUV , is roughly constant (within the uncertainties)\nwith decreasing UV luminosity, as both UV and IR luminosities decrease in tandem. In any case, it is clear\nfrom these observations that care must be taken when inferring the average dust obscuration and LIR , and their\neffect on global quantities like the star formation rate\ndensity, given the UV luminosity dependence of these\nquantities (Reddy et al. 2008; Reddy & Steidel 2009).\n6. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have used the deep 100 and 160 \u03bcm data of the\nGOODS-Herschel Open Time Key Program, supplemented with deep Spitzer/MIPS 24 \u03bcm and VLA 1.4 GHz\nradio imaging, to investigate the infrared luminosities\nand dust obscuration of typical star-forming galaxies at\nhigh redshift. We focus on the median stacked midinfrared, far-infrared, and radio fluxes of a sample of\n146 UV-selected galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts\n1.5 \u2264 zspec < 2.6 in the GOODS-North field. These\ngalaxies have luminosities around L\u2217 of the UV luminosity function at these redshifts.\nBecause these galaxies are individually undetected at\n\n100, 160 \u03bcm, and 1.4 GHz, we perform median stacking\nanalyses to measure their average fluxes. Three tests are\nperformed to verify the robustness of our stacked results.\nThe first test measured the effects of clustering. The second test determined the chance probability of measuring\na stacked flux as high as the one obtained for the target\ngalaxies. The third test allows us to measure the biases and uncertainties in stacked flux measurements by\nstacking on the positions of artificial sources added to\nthe images.\nTo interprete these fluxes, we consider a variety of dust templates, including those of Elbaz et al.\n(2011), Chary & Elbaz (2001), Dale & Helou (2002), and\nRieke et al. (2009), as well as the 24 \u03bcm-LIR and radioinfrared correlations of Reddy et al. (2010) and Bell\n(2003), respectively. Fitting these templates to the biascorrected fluxes and infrared colors reveals that L\u2217UV\ngalaxies at z \u223c 2 with UV luminosities LUV & 1010 L\u2299\nhave a median infrared luminosity of LIR = (2.2 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7\n1011 L\u2299 . Galaxies in our sample exhibit LIR /L8 (IR8)\nratios that are a factor of \u2248 2 larger than those found for\nmost star-forming galaxies at lower redshifts, likely due\nto the fact these UV-selected galaxies are relatively compact for their infrared luminosity. One possibility is that\nthe roughly constant IR8 ratio observed for most (main\nsequence) galaxies with redshifts z . 2.0 likely shifts towards larger values at z & 2.0, due to the fact that the\ngalaxies are on average smaller for their IR luminosity\nrelative to lower redshift galaxies.\nStacking the Spitzer, Herschel, and VLA data as a\nfunction of UV spectral slope, \u03b2, and bolometric luminosity, Lbol , indicates that galaxies with redder \u03b2 and\nhigher Lbol have on average larger infrared luminosities,\nin accord with expectations based on trends found for\nlocal star-forming galaxies. Based on the LIR , we proceed to examine the dust attenuation, LIR /LUV , and\nthe dust correction factor (i.e., the factor required to\nrecover the bolometric SFR from the unobscured UV\nSFR), 1+ SFRIR /SFRUV , for galaxies in our sample.\nFor L\u2217 galaxies at z \u223c 2, we find a dust attenuation\nof LIR /LUV = 7.1 \u00b1 1.1, which corresponds to a dust\ncorrection factor of 5.2 \u00b1 0.6, implying that \u2243 80% of\nthe star formation is obscured. This result is consistent with those found in previous studies of the dustcorrected UV and H\u03b1, 24 \u03bcm, and radio and X-ray stacks\nof the same galaxies examined here (Reddy & Steidel\n2004; Reddy et al. 2006b, 2010).\nWe have examined the relationship between the UV\nspectral slope, \u03b2, and dustiness for z \u223c 2 galaxies. A\nsmall fraction (\u2248 14%) of galaxies are identified as having stellar population ages . 100 Myr from fitting stellar\npopulation SEDs to the observed optical through nearIR photometry. The upper limit in dust attenuation for\nthese \"young\" galaxies suggests that they may follow a\n\"steeper\" attenuation curve than the one observed for local starburst galaxies (Meurer et al. 1999; Calzetti et al.\n2000), in the sense that they are less dusty (i.e., have\nlower LIR /LUV ratios) for a given \u03b2 than older and more\ntypical galaxies at the same redshift. This result was\nfirst noted in the 24 \u03bcm analyses of Reddy et al. (2006b)\nand further investigated in Reddy et al. (2010), and may\nbe attributable to the higher dust covering fractions in\nyoung galaxies. When considering more typical galaxies\n\n\f18\nwith ages & 100 Myr, we find that their median LIR /LUV\nincreases as \u03b2 becomes redder, and that this correlation\nis essentially identical to that found for local starbursts\n(Meurer et al. 1999; Calzetti et al. 2000). Comparison of\nthe Herschel results at z \u223c 2 with measurements of local\ngalaxies confirms the previously found trends that imply that LIRGs at z \u223c 2 are more UV transparent (i.e.,\nless dusty) than LIRGs in the local universe, and that\nUV-faint galaxies at z \u223c 2 have lower LIR and hence\nfainter bolometric luminosities than UV-bright galaxies\nat z \u223c 2 (e.g., see also Reddy et al. 2010). Based on\nthe direct Herschel measurements of the rest-frame \u2243 30\nand 50 \u03bcm thermal dust emission, we find that the local\nUV attenuation curve holds at z \u223c 2 for galaxies with\nLbol . 1012 L\u2299 , suggesting a remarkable similarity in the\nprocesses governing star formation and dust production\nover the last 10 billion years of cosmic time.\nWe have made significant progress in evaluating the\neffects of dust in typical star-forming galaxies at z \u223c 2\nas traced by thermal infrared emission. However, even\nthe superb sensitivity and resolution of Herschel are not\nsufficient to individually detect L\u2217 galaxies at these redshifts. The most accurate estimate of dust luminosity,\nand hence total star formation rate, can only come from\ncombining individual measurements of UV and IR lu-\n\nminosities. Though the observations will be targeted,\nALMA promises to extend our knowledge of the dust\ncontinuum luminosities of individual star-forming galaxies at z \u223c 2, thus providing the key ingredient to combine with UV measurements. These developments point\nto a wealth of forthcoming information on the properties\nof dust in typical star-forming galaxies at high redshift.\nUltimately, a robust characterization of the relationship\nbetween infrared and short wavelength (UV, H\u03b1) emission will be crucial for inferring dust attenuation and\ntotal star formation rates of the very faint and/or very\nhigh redshift galaxies that will be inaccessible to even\nthe next generation of long wavelength observatories.\nSupport for NAR was provided by NASA through Hubble Fellowship grant HST-HF-01223.01 awarded by the\nSpace Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by\nthe Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., for NASA, under contract NAS 5-26555.
