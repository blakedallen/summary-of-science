Introduction\nMost methods for Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations are inefficient for\npaths with large number of points. This is due mostly to the critical slow down (CSD) for\nlower dimensions and to the volume factor [5] for many dimensions. Furthermore, current\napplications of PIMC methods for solutions of Schr\u00f6dinger equations for atomic systems is\nrestricted because of the singularity of the potential functions. These systems are usually\nsolved by Green's function Monte Carlo (GFMC) algorithms [2-3].\nIn this work (1) A path integral formulation appropriate for Coulomb potentials is\npresented is Sec. 2. This formulation is based on a quadratic polynomial approximation\nof the classical motion. The resulting action integral can be expressed as a standard\nlinear expression of the action integral with an effective potential. This effective potential\ndepends on \u03c4 2 , where \u03c4 is the mesh size (time step). (2) A multigrid algorithm using a\n\"unigrid\" approach is used for solving the hydrogen atom (Sec. 3). This algorithm uses\na linear interpolation of changes to coordinates [5], rather then constant interpolation [1].\nThe use of linear interpolation eliminates the CSD with simple V (1, 1) multigrid cycles.\nThe integrated decorrelation time \u03c4int is below 10 for all measured observables. In Sec.4\nthe numerical results with the multigrid algorithm are presented. For comparison, the\nsame problem is solved with a staging algorithm [6-11].\n\n\u2020 Partly supported by the U.S. Army Research Office through the Mathematical Sciences\nInstitute of Cornell University\n\u2021 Mathematical Sciences Institute, 409 College Av., Ithaca, NY 14850\n1\n\n\f2. Path integral formulation for the hydrogen atom\nIn this section ri , i = 0, . . . , N \u2212 1 denotes the 3D coordinate vector (xi , yi , zi ) of the\nelectron, \u03c4 is the meshsize (timestep) of the path and N is the number of path points.\nSince only the ground state is considered the path is closed and rN = r0 . Vi denotes the\npotential function at ri , and M is the mass of the electron.\nThe standard first order approximation of the action integral for a path \u0393 is\nS1 (\u0393) = \u03c4\n\nN\u22121\nX\n\nVi + (M/2\u03c4 )\n\ni=0\n\nN\u22121\nX\ni=0\n\n2\n\n(ri+1 \u2212 ri ) .\n\n(2.1)\n\nThe relative probability for the path is,\nP (\u0393) = e\u2212S1 (\u0393) .\nHowever, this approximation fails for the Coulomb potential\nV (r) = \u22121/r.\n\nThe reason is that when the Metropolis [4] algorithm is used to generate new paths, the\npath points tend to concentrate near r = 0, resulting in meaningless measurements of\nobservables. This happens because near r = 0, the transition probability from large r is\nvery close to 1. Similarly, since the transition probability from r = 0 to large r is very\nsmall. Hence a path point can not make the transition to larger r, once trapped near\nr = 0.\nIn terms of the classical path, the standard approximation (2.1) assumes that during\nthe time \u03c4 , the particle a) Move along the straight line connecting ri and ri+1 , and b) The\ntime that the particle spends along any portion of that line is proportional to its length.\nIt is mostly the second assumption that breaks down near the singularity, since classically\nif ri is near 0, the particle spends most of its time away from it.\nTo make a better approximation of the classical motion, assumption a) above is preserved, but instead of b) the motion is assumed to be in a constant force field. For a\nmotion from ri to ri+1 the classical acceleration ai , is given by\nai = \u2212\u00fb(V (ri+1 ) \u2212 V (ri ))/M |ri+1 \u2212 ri |,\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere \u00fb is the unit vector in the direction from ri to ri+1 . The position as a function of\ntime is,\nr(t) = ri + (ri+1 \u2212 ri )((t \u2212 ti )/\u03c4 ) + ai (t \u2212 ti )(t \u2212 ti \u2212 \u03c4 ).\n\nThis classical motion conserves energy. Therefore the total energy Ei for the motion\nri \u2192 ri+1 can be taken as the energy at time ti ,\nwhere vi is\n\nEi = M vi 2 /2 \u2212 1/ri\n\nvi = (ri+1 \u2212 ri )/\u03c4 \u2212 ai \u03c4.\n\n(2.3)\n\nThus, the action integral for a path \u0393 is\n\nS2 (\u0393) = \u03c4\n\nN\u22121\nX\ni=0\n\n2\n\nEi\n\n(2.4)\n\n\f2.1 Simplified path integral formulation\n2\n\nFrom (2.3), the expression for vi2 contains three terms: (i) (ri+1 \u2212 ri ) /\u03c4 2 . This is\nthe same expression for the squared velocity that appears in the standard approximation\n(2.1). (ii) \u03c4 2 a2 . From (2.2), in the limit \u03c4 \u2192 0, this term for the Coulomb potential is\nO(\u03c4 2 /r 4 ). Similarly, in the same limit the term (iii) \u22122ai (ri+1 \u2212 ri ) is O(1/r 2 ).\nNear r = 0, the term (ii) is dominant. For large r, the standard term (i) is dominant.\nIt is therefore reasonable to approximate the kinetic energy by preserving only terms (i)\nand (ii), and omitting (iii) altogether. The action integral is then,\n\nS(\u0393) = (M/2\u03c4 )\n\nN\u22121\nX\ni=0\n\n2\n\n(ri+1 \u2212 ri ) \u2212 \u03c4\n\nN\u22121\nX\n\n1/ri + \u03c4 (A/M )\n\ni=0\n\nN\u22121\nX\n\n\u03c4 2 /r 4 ,\n\n(2.5)\n\ni=0\n\nwhere A is a positive constant. The last two terms can be regarded as a sum over an\neffective potential\n\u1e7ci (r, \u03c4 ) = \u22121/ri + A\u03c4 2 /M ri4 .\n\n(2.6)\n\nNote that the last term in (2.6) acts as a repulsive potential, and thus prevents the\n\u221a\n4\npath points from falling into r = 0. For a fixed u = A\u03c4 2 /M r(u) , r(u) decreases as \u03c4 .\nWith \u1e7c the action integral is\n\nS(\u0393) = (M/2\u03c4 )\n\nN\u22121\nX\ni=0\n\n2\n\n(ri+1 \u2212 ri ) + \u03c4\n\nN\u22121\nX\n\n\u1e7ci .\n\n(2.7)\n\ni=0\n\nThis considerably simplifies the Monte Carlo sampling of paths, as its form is the same as\nthe standard approximation (2.1).\n\n3\n\n\f3. Multigrid algorithm\nTo eliminate the correlation between paths, a multigrid algorithm is used for generating paths. The algorithm in this study implements a \"unigrid\" approach, because of\nits simplicity. In this approach there is only a single grid and coarse level operations are\nemulated on this grid. Such an algorithm in not very effective in reducing the volume\nfactor (see. [5]) for a large number of dimensions. However, it is effective in eliminating\nthe CSD (see Sec. 4), which is the most important factor in efficiency degradation for\nlower number of dimensions such as the hydrogen atom. For higher dimensions, a fully\nmultigridded algorithm should be used.\nThe finest level l = 0 contains the whole set of points i = 0, . . . , N \u2212 1 of the path,\ncorresponding to times ti = i\u03c4 . N is assumed to be an integral power of 2. A coarser level\nl = 1, . . . , lc contains the set of nl = N/2l points il = n2l , n = 0, 1, . . . , nl , corresponding\nto the times til = til \u03c4 .\nOn the finest level, a relaxation sweep consists of changing the coordinates of each\npath point in turn, and accepting or rejecting the new position by the standard Metropolis\nalgorithm [4].\nTo explain the relaxations on coarse grids, the following notation is introduced. Let\n\u0393i1,i2 be the set of path points corresponding to times ti1 , ti1+1 , . . . , ti2 . Let Si1,i2 be the\naction integral of \u0393i1,i2 :\nSi1,i2 = (M/2\u03c4 )\n\ni2\u22121\nX\ni=i1\n\n2\n\n(ri+1 \u2212 ri ) + \u03c4\n\ni2\nX\n\n\u1e7ci ,\n\n(3.1)\n\ni=i1\n\nwhere \u1e7c is given by Eq. (2.6).\nA relaxation sweep on level l > 0, is emulated by visiting all path points corresponding\nto that level. When the point il is visited, simultaneous changes of the coordinates are\nmade to \u0393il \u22122l ,il +2l . These changes are given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n|il \u2212 i|\n\u03b4i = 1 \u2212\n\u03be\u03b4l\n2l\n\ni = il \u2212 2l , . . . , il , . . . , il + 2l\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere \u03b4l is a constant, \u03b4 i is the 3D vector (\u03b4x , \u03b4y , \u03b4z ) of changes to the space coordinates\n(x, y, z) and \u03be is the 3D vector (\u03bex , \u03bey , \u03bez ). Each of the components of \u03be is a random variable\nwith uniform distribution in [\u22121, 1] (See also Sec. 4.1). If S a is the action of \u0393il \u22122l ,il +2l\nbefore changes to coordinates are made, and S b is the action after the changes, the new\nconfiguration is accepted according to the transition probability\nPab = min(1, e\u2212(S\n\nb\n\n\u2212S a )\n\n).\n\nPaths are generated by cycling on all levels, usually with V(1,1) cycles. W-cycles or other\ncycles which increase the number of passes on coarse levels relative to fine levels (i.e.\nhigher cycle indices, [5] works as well, and are effective in reducing the decorrelation times\nbetween paths. However, in the \"unigrid\" approach, the work spent on a coarse level is not\n4\n\n\fmuch less than the work on a fine level. Therefore there is not much to gain in efficiency\nby performing more relaxations on coarse levels. Note, however, that using higher cycle\nindex with the \"unigrid\" approach is an effective research tool for studying the behavior\nof the algorithm.\nMeasurements of observables can be done either on the finest or on coarser levels.\nBecause of the high correlations between adjacent path points on the finest level, some\nwork may be saved making measurements on coarser levels. However, observables that\ndepend on correlations between adjacent path points, such as the the mean of squared\nvelocity can not be measured on coarse levels.\n4. Numerical experiments\nNumerical results for the hydrogen atom with the multigrid algorithm are presented\nin Sec. 4.1. For comparison, results with a simplified staging algorithm ([9-11]) for the\nsame problem are presented in (Sec. 4.2).\nAll computations in this section are done with the effective potential (2.6). The results\nof the calculations are not very sensitive to value of A in (2.6). In all numerical experiments\nin this section A = 0.005 is always used.\n\n5\n\n\f4.1 Multigrid results\nIn Table 1, the results with V(1,1) cycles with the \"unigrid\" approach (Sec. 3) are\ndescribed for different number of levels. The meshsize of a level l with Nl points is \u03c4l =\n32/Nl .\nIn a relaxation sweep on the finest level (l = 0) the (xi , yi , zi ) coordinates are changed\nsimultaneously at each path point by adding \u03b4 = (\u03b4x , \u03b4y , \u03b4z ) to the current values. \u03b4 is\ncalculated by \u03b4 = \u03be\u03b40 . \u03b40 is a constant scalar optimized to yield Metropolis acceptance\nratio of \u223c 0.5 on that level. On coarser levels, simultaneous changes are made to the 3\nspace coordinates of more than one point, as described in Sec.3. As with \u03b40 , the scalar\nconstant \u03b4l for l > 0 is chosen so that the Metropolis acceptance ratio on that level is\n\u223c 0.5.\nThe observables measured are the mean radius of the electron < r >, the mean inverse\nof the radius < 1/r > and the mean kinetic energy < ek >. < ek > is approximated by\naveraging the operator\n\n(M/2\u03c4 2 ) ((xi+1 \u2212 xi )(xi \u2212 xi\u22121 ) + (yi+1 \u2212 yi )(yi \u2212 yi\u22121 ) + (zi+1 \u2212 zi )(zi \u2212 zi\u22121 ))\nwhere \u03c4 is the meshsize ([12]).

The results in\nthe table are for the last case listed in Table 1 (L = 10, N0 = 2048). The Metropolis\nacceptance ratio (MAR) is listed in the last column. For fine levels, \u03b4l is proportional to\nthe square root of the meshsize. For coarser levels with mean distance between grid points\n6\n\n\fcomparable to < r >, \u03b4l becomes smaller with increased meshsize.\nl\n\u03b4l\nM AR\n0 0.125\n0.505\n1 0.175\n0.509\n2 0.245\n0.513\n3 0.343\n0.516\n4 0.480\n0.518\n5 0.672\n0.511\n6 0.941\n0.479\n7 1.054\n0.487\n8 0.922\n0.490\n9 0.646\n0.515\nTable 2 - behavior of \u03b4l\n\n7\n\n\f4.2 Staging algorithm results\nAs a comparison with the performance of the multigrid algorithm the results of a\nstaging algorithm for the same problem are described. This staging algorithm is similar to\nthe algorithm used in [6], [7], and is a simplified version of the algorithm described in [8].\nIn a relaxation sweep, each point i of the path becomes an end point of a chain of\nadjacent p path points i, i+1, . . . , i+p+1. The two end points i and i+p+1 are held fixed\nand the coordinates of all the other chain points are changed simultaneously with means\nand variances of a Levy walk. The new chain configuration is then accepted or rejected.\nFew trials per chain may be repeated to increase efficiency.\nTable 3 describes the results of the staging algorithm for the hydrogen atom, with\ndifferent number of path points (N ), chain length (Nc , including the end points) and trials\nper chain (Ntry ). The meshsize \u03c4 is 32/N . The last three columns lists 1) the computational work per relaxation sweep (Wr ). Wr is proportional to the number of random\nnumbers with uniform distribution in [0, 1] produced in a single relaxation sweep. 2) The\nMetropolis acceptance ratio (M AR) of chain states, and 3) The integrated decorrelation\ntimes (\u03c4int ) for measurements of < r >.\nAs seen in Table 3, for large N , M AR is approximately 0.5 for Nc = 5 and Ntry = 2.\nIncreasing these two numbers results only in very small decrease of \u03c4int . Clearly, although\nthe staging algorithm is much faster than a primitive Metropolis algorithm, it does not\neliminate the CSD.\nN\n32\n\n\u03c4\n1.0\n\nNc\n4\n5\n6\n\n64\n\n0.5\n\n4\n5\n6\n\n128\n\n256\n\n512\n\n0.25\n\n0.125\n\n0.0625\n\n4\n5\n4\n5\n5\n\nNtry\n1\n2\n2\n3\n4\n5\n1\n2\n3\n3\n4\n5\n1\n1\n2\n1\n1\n2\n2\n\nWr\n0.21\n0.44\n0.64\n0.95\n1.7\n2.1\n0.44\n1.3\n1.9\n2.5\n3.3\n4.1\n0.86\n1.30\n2.5\n1.7\n2.5\n5.1\n10.0\n\nM AR\n0.32\n0.67\n0.32\n0.48\n0.24\n0.32\n0.45\n0.46\n0.67\n0.31\n0.41\n0.50\n0.50\n0.25\n0.51\n0.51\n0.27\n0.53\n0.53\n\nTable 3 - Staging algorithm\n8\n\n\u03c4int < r >\n15.6\n7.7\n7.8\n7.7\n9.5\n8.5\n33.0\n14.6\n\n12.5\n120.0\n75.0\n\n350.0\n1240.0\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nThe author with to thank A.
