[2] lists the values\nof 22 cosmological parameters determined using the WMAP data and other recent\nobservational information. Many of these values are quoted with several significant\nfigures, whereas a decade ago they were either completely undetermined or had massive\nuncertainties.\nFor the theoretical cosmologist, the WMAP results are more tantalizing than revolutionary. On the one hand, WMAP confirms that there is a significant contribution from\ndark energy in the present epoch, puts tight constraints on the parameter space open\nto inflation, and provides strong support to the overall inflationary paradigm. However,\nthis does not surprise most theoreticians, and nothing in the current WMAP dataset puts\ngenuinely nontrivial constraints on the physics of inflation and the very early universe.\nTo explain further, consider vanilla inflation \u2013 an almost exactly de Sitter inflationary\nepoch which lasts long enough to deliver a primordial universe \u2013 whose measurable\nparameters all have their \"default values\". After vanilla inflation, scalar perturbations\nare Gaussian and scale-free, and there is no discernible contribution from tensor modes\nor curvature in the present epoch. Consequently, all parameters which constrain the\nprimordial universe would be measured as upper bounds, rather than definite values.\nAlmost all inflationary models have parameters which can be tuned to provide a\nvanilla limit. In some cases these tunings may appear so unnatural, and one may want\nto exclude the model on aesthetic grounds. For instance, the perturbation spectrum\nassociated with a \u03c6 n potential becomes more strongly scale dependent as n increases,\nand one may argue that n should be an even, positive number. The vanilla limit of this\n\n\fmodel is n \u2192 0, so if n \u2265 2 is experimentally excluded, the model becomes less attractive.\nHowever, this prejudice is far less compelling than the observation of an unambiguously\nblue spectrum (one with more power on short scales than on long scales): in this case\nall positive values of n are excluded. The one type of inflation which is hard to tune is\nde Sitter inflation, where the inflaton is trapped in a local minimum of the potential and\ndoes not evolve at all. However, in this case the spectrum is precisely scale invariant,\nwhich is the vanilla result.\nVanilla inflation has an ambiguous position in theoretical cosmology. It has the most\n\"natural\" set of parameter values but offers the smallest leverage for discriminating between different realisations of inflation, and thus the least insight into the early universe.\nConsequently, theoreticians tend to seize on any hints that the inflationary epoch contains non-vanilla flavorings, since these significantly constrain the inflationary parameter space and, in extreme cases, challenge the overall paradigm. The first year WMAP\ndataset has two tantalizing features: the apparent lack of power at long wavelengths,\nand the suggestion that the scalar spectral index itself is a function of the perturbation's\nwavelength.\n\nTHE CMB AND INFLATION\nAlmost any possible inflationary epoch can be described in terms of a scalar field\n\u03c6 moving in a potential, V (\u03c6 ).1 From the Einstein field equations and the energy\nmomentum tensor for a minimally coupled scalar field once can deduce\n\u0015\n\u0012 \u00132\n\u0014\n8\u03c0 1 2\n\u0227\n2\n\u03c6\u0307 +V (\u03c6 ) ,\n(1)\n=\nH =\na\n3m2Pl 2\nwhere a(t) is the spacetime scale factor, and a dot denotes differentiation with respect\nto time. We are implicitly assuming a spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic universe\nwhere the inflaton field is the only contribution to the energy-momentum tensor. The\nmotion of the field is given by\n\n\u03c6\u0308 + 3H \u03c6\u0307 +V \u2032 (\u03c6 ) = 0,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the dash notes differentiation with respect to \u03c6 .\nGuth's original paper on inflation [6] addressed problems associated with the dynamics of the cosmological background. Inflation can be implemented in a multitude of\ndifferent ways, all of which solve the cosmological problems addressed by Guth. Consequently, inflationary model builders do not focus directly on the expansion history of\nthe universe. In addition to the zero-order dynamics needed to set the stage for a hot bigbang universe, inflation also predicts the first order perturbations about this background\nsolution. These perturbations determine both the clustering properties of galaxies, and\nthe anisotropies in the microwave background.\n1\n\nI am restricting myself to single field models, but all of the statements below have an analogous\n(although often weaker) form for multi-field models.\n\n\fInflation produces primordial perturbations by magnifying quantum fluctuations until\ntheir wavelength is equal to or larger than the present size of the observable universe. The\nproperties of these fluctuations differ markedly between different inflationary models\nand specific inflationary scenarios can thus be distinguished from one another and tested\nvia their perturbation spectra. Consequently, putting tight experimental constraints on\nthe perturbation spectrum is of prime importance, since the theoretical cosmologist can\nuse this data to eliminate specific inflationary models. However, almost all inflationary\nmodels have a vanilla limit, so as long as vanilla inflation remains consistent with the\nobservational data we cannot exclude entire classes of models.\nGiven the functional form of the potential and fairly mild assumptions about the dynamics of inflation, we express the perturbation spectra as a function of the potential\nand its derivatives. A general perturbation to the background g\u03bc\u03bd is a symmetric tensor,\nh\u03bc\u03bd , where the perturbed spacetime is g\u03bc\u03bd +h\u03bc\u03bd [7]. We decompose h into scalar, vector\nand anti-symmetric tensor components, where the decomposition reflects the transformation properties of the different pieces under (small) transformations. Cosmologically,\nwe need consider only the scalar and tensor modes, as the vector modes decay with\ntime. The scalar modes are associated with a gravitational potential and are the source\nof density fluctuations in the universe. The tensor modes are effectively gravity waves\n(and are often referred to as such) and do not contribute to the formation of structure in\nthe universe, but do contribute to the microwave background anisotropies, especially at\nlarge angular scales.\nThe perturbations are described in terms of their power spectra,\n1/2\n\nPS\n\n\u223c knS \u22121 ,\n\n1/2\n\nPT\n\n\u223c knT\n\n(3)\n\nwhere k is the comoving wavenumber of the perturbation. If nS = 1 or nT = 0 the amount\nof power in each mode is independent of k and the resulting spectra are scale invariant.2\nWe know that the underlying spectra must be roughly scale invariant, but the question\nis whether the difference between nS and nT from their \"natural\" values of 1 and 0 is\ndetectable observationally.\nUsing the slow roll approximation, we can write nS and nT in terms of derivatives of\nthe potential [8],\nnT = \u22122\u03b5\n(4)\nnS = 1 + 2\u03b7 \u2212 4\u03b5 ,\nwhere\n\nm2p\n\u03b5=\n16\u03c0\n\n\u0012\n\nV\u2032\nV\n\n\u00132\n\n\"\n\u0012 \u0013 #\nm2p V \u2032 1 V \u2032 2\n.\n\u2212\n\u03b7=\n8\u03c0 V\n2 V\n\n,\n\n(5)\n\nFinally, the amplitudes of the two spectra must obey a consistency condition,\n1/2\n\nPT\n\n1/2\n\n= 16\u03b5\n\nPS\n2\n\nThe differing definitions of PS and PT are an historical anomaly.\n\n(6)\n\n\fFIGURE 1. The three classes of single field inflationary models are displayed. The hybrid models have\n\u03b7 > \u03b5 > 0, and the small field models have \u03b7 < 0. Vanilla inflation corresponds to r = 0 and n = 1, the\npoint at which the three wedges intersect. (Plot from [9].)\n\nwhere the numerical coefficient is, to some extent, a matter of definition. We can divide\ninflationary models into three general classes, summarized in Figure 1 [9]. In the hybrid\ncase, the V \u2032\u2032 /V \u226b (V \u2032 /V )2 , and the field is evolving towards a local minimum of the\npotential. Conversely, if we find nS < 1 and no detectable tensor contribution, V \u2032\u2032 < 0\nand V \u2032 \u223c 0, and we have small field inflation. Finally, if we observe a significant tensor\ncomponent, we must have V \u2032 /V 6= 0. From the equation of motion for \u03c6 , we see that\n\u03c6\u0307 6= 0, and the total evolution of \u03c6 during inflation can be substantial \u2013 leading to the\nmoniker large field inflation.\nWhile a non-zero scalar spectrum is needed to provide the primordial density fluctuations that seed the formation of structure, a primordial tensor spectrum is optional.\n1/2\nWe can show that the PT is proproportional to the value of H (and thus the square\nroot of the energy density) during inflation and, unless H is GUT scale or above, the\ntensor signal will most likely be forever undetectable. Since a detectable tensor signal\nis produced by a limited range of inflationary models the vanilla prediction is that the\nCMB contains no detectable contribution from tensors. However, if we do observe a\nprimordial tensor spectrum, then we can immediately deduce the energy scale at which\ninflation occurred. Moreover, if we can measure both its amplitude and index, we are in\nthe pleasant position of having four observable quantities (the amplitudes and indices of\nthe tensor and scalar spectrum) which are specified in terms of three parameters. This\nleads to a \"consistency condition\" which must be satisfied (to first order in slow-roll) by\nall single field inflationary models.\n\nTHE WMAP RESULTS: SUMMARY\nConceptually, the WMAP mission is very simple: over a period of several years, it makes\nrepeated observations of the microwave sky, and is sensitive to both temperature and po-\n\n\fFIGURE 2. The WMAP power spectrum, where the shaded region represents the expected cosmic\nvariance about the best fit spectrum [3].\n\nlarization. It observes in five frequency bands, since the main foreground contaminants\nscale differently with frequency from the underlying black body of the CMB.\nInformation can be extracted from the maps directly (for instance, the topology of\nisotemperature contours is a function of the underlying cosmological model [10]), but\nthe maps are frequently distilled into a power spectrum by expanding them in spherical\nharmonics, and the WMAP power spectrum is shown in Figure 2. Different theoretical\nmodels of the early universe predict different scalar and tensor spectra, but the CMB also\ndepends on parameters such as the cosmological constant and the Hubble constant via\ntheir influence on the evolution of the perturbations as they propagate in an expanding\nuniverse. This is crucial, since it turns the CMB into a tool for estimating a wide range of\ncosmological parameters which, taken together, put tight constraints on the composition\nand history of our universe.\nGiven a set of parameters, the theoretical spectrum is estimated using a tool such\nas CMBFAST. Armed with high quality CMB data (and data from other sources) one\ncan find the \"best fit\" model by varying the parameters until the underlying spectrum is\nmatched as accurately as possible. Spergel et al. [2] describes this process. The WMAP\nteam concludes that the age of the universe is 13.7 \u00b10.2Gyr, the total mass-energy of the\nuniverse is \u03a9tot = 1.02 \u00b1 0.02 (where a value of unity corresponds to a universe with no\nspatial curvature), the parameterized Hubble constant h = 0.71+0.04\n\u22120.03 , and baryon density\n2\n(as a fraction of the total energy density) \u03a9b h = 0.0224 \u00b1 0.0009. Little more than a\ndecade ago, the value of all of these numbers was the subject of significant controversy,\nand yet here they are all quoted to two or three significant figures.\n\n\fFIGURE 3. The cross-correlation between the E-mode polarization and temperature anisotropies in the\nCMB. The solid line represents the inflationary prediction, while the defect prediction is shown by the\ndotted line [3].\n\nPOLARIZATION\nSince the first detection of the CMB anisotropies, attention has focussed on the temperature variations. The polarization also varies from point to point, but this anisotropy is\nintrinsically smaller and more difficult to measure. WMAP is the first full-sky mission\nto return a non-zero polarization measurement [5].3\nIn a universe where inflation occurs, the primordial perturbations may be correlated\non scales far larger than the present size of the observable universe, and were definitely\ncorrelated on super-horizon scales when the microwave background photons decoupled\nfrom the rest of the universe some 300,000 years after the big bang. While other mechanisms for generating the primordial density perturbations have been explored (particularly \"defect models\" where objects such as cosmic strings generate perturbations as\nthey move through the universe), these do not produce super-horizon correlations.4 A\nfrequent critique of inflation is that the overall paradigm makes no generic predictions,\nand that there is no one property that all inflationary models share. However, a universe\n3\n\nThe polarization itself was first detected by the DASI mission [11].\nThe ekpyrotic [12] and pre big bang [13] scenarios both produce super-horizon correlations, but in\na universe which is initially contracting. While the proponents of these models typically define them in\ncontrast to inflation, they resemble inflation more than they resemble defect models of structure formation.\nIn particular, like inflation, they possess an era in which \u00e4 > 0 and modes with fixed comoving size are\ncontinually leaving the horizon.\n\n4\n\n\fwith super-horizon perturbations at decoupling has a characteristic correlation between\nthe temperature anisotropies and the E-mode polarization signal. WMAP was observed\nthis correlation, and found that it closely matches the inflationary prediction.\nIt is worth pausing to reflect what a significant achievement this is: from my perspective the observed correlation between temperature and E-mode polarization is most\nimportant single result in the WMAP dataset. Prior to inflation, no-one had predicted\nsuper-horizon correlations, so this observation is a stunning verification of one of the\nkey features of inflation. Moreover, if the data had not confirmed the inflationary prediction, almost all models of inflation would have been ruled out in a single stroke.5\nConsequently, this is a key test of the inflationary paradigm. The only downside (and\nperhaps the reason why more is not being said about it) is that because all inflationary\nmodels make this prediction, it only eliminates models such as defect scenarios which\nhave already fallen from favor in the theoretical community. However, I suspect that this\nobservation will be regarded as one of the lasting achievements of WMAP, and that observations of the hT Ei cross-correlation will be followed carefully as the data improves.\n\nSURPRISES: NON-VANILLA FEATURES IN WMAP?\nThe two obvious peculiarities in the WMAP dataset are that the spectrum has anomalously low power on small scales, and that the fit to the data improves if the scalar index\nis allowed to be scale-dependent (that is, ns is a function of k). Either of these results\ncould provide a dramatic non-vanilla flavor to the early universe. However, in both cases\ntheir physical significance is hard to quantify and await both further data and theoretical\nanalysis.\n\nLow Quadrupole\nThe low quadrupole is visible in the power spectrum of Figure 2, as the first data\npoints lie well below the best-fit spectrum. Due to cosmic variance6 , we don't expect an\nexact match between theory and experiment at small values of l, but the discrepancy is,\non the face of it, unexpectedly large.\nWhile it is clear that the observed CMB sky has less power at large wavelengths (low\nk) than that suggested by the \"best fit\" \u039bCDM model, it is not clear is whether this is\nsomething we need to explain, since the result could be produced by cosmic variance\nalone. Spergel et al. [2] generated multiple realizations of the microwave background\nwith the parameters estimated by WMAP, and found that the probability that the low\npower at small l is due to cosmic variance is 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 . However, other authors ([14],\n5\n\nInflation may still have occurred, but it could not have produced the observed primordial perturbations.\nThe Cl values plotted in Figure 2 represent averages over the 2l + 1 \u221a\nm values of the corresponding Ylm .\nRoughly speaking, this average will have a sampling uncertainty of 1/ 2l + 1 \u2013 but since we can observe\nonly one sky we cannot reduce this uncertainty by gathering more data. This intrinsic uncertainty is the\ncosmic variance.\n6\n\n\ffor example) argue that this calculation underestimates cosmic variance, and that the\ndiscrepancy is not large enough to be a signal of new physics.\nIf this result is significant, the possible modifications to the standard paradigm that\nwould suppress power at large scales take a variety of forms. For example, a comparatively conservate approach is provided by Contaldi et al. [15], who look at inflationary\nmodels which are tuned to suppress PS for values of k which dominate the low l terms\nin the CMB spectrum. Carefully tuned inflationary models violate the spirit of the inflationary paradigm, but they are less radical departures from the standard cosmology than\n(for instance) advocating a toroidal universe with a \"cell size\" that is smaller than the\ncurrent size of the visible universe [16], or that the universe possesses detectable (and\npositive) spatial curvature [17], both of which would tend to cut off the power spectrum\nat long wavelengths.\nSimply measuring the microwave sky more accurately will not reduce the cosmic variance. However, it is possible that some of lack of power at low l could be explained by\nan over-aggressive foreground subtraction, and this is amenable to testing and improvement. Conversely, if the suppression of power at low l is a real effect, evidence for it will\nappear in other places. For example, Kesden et al. [18] show that the shear produced by\ngravitational inhomogeneities, which distorts the correlation between temperature and\npolarization anisotropies, would be measurably different in a universe where the spectrum lacked power at small values of k, and this can be tested by future experiments.\n\nRunning Index\nThe low quadrupole seen by WMAP is suggestive of unsuspected physics that plays\na role at large angular scales. However, WMAP also hints that the standard assumption\nof an underlying spectrum described by a constant index nS may be too simplistic [4]. In\nthis case, the principal evidence is found in CMB data at small angular scales. This\nis currently dominated by observational uncertainty, rather than cosmic variance. In\nfact, the first-year WMAP dataset alone does cover a large enough range of l-values to\nprovide any evidence for a running (k dependent) nS . The evidence for running (between\nthe 1 and 2 \u03c3 level) appears when the WMAP power spectrum is combined with that\nderived from galaxy surveys and Lyman-\u03b1 forest data, both of which provide data on\nthe primordial spectrum at smaller scales than is possible with the CMB alone [4].\nIf the running index is confirmed, it will put tight constraints on inflation. The slow\nroll expansion for the spectral index given by equation (3) can be extended to beyond\nthe leading order result given here, and dnS /d ln k is dependent on the third derivative of\nthe potential. However, having V \u2032\u2032\u2032 (\u03c6 ) large enough to produce a dnS /d ln k observable\nby WMAP rules out almost all standard models of inflation. This is not, in itself, a\ndrawback. Moreover, it would comprehensively rule out vanilla inflation, which would\nbe very a welcome development indeed. Moreover, if the potential has a number of\n\"features\" then it may not need to be carefully tuned in order to ensure that one of these\nfeatures is found within the range of \u03c6 covered by the inflaton field as the cosmologically\nrelevant perturbations are generated [19]. Indeed, a potential of this sort was considered\nby the WMAP team, and there is weak support in the WMAP dataset (in combination\n\n\fwith other survey information) for this type of feature.\nThe major caveat about this possible non-vanilla flavoring of the early universe is\nsimply that the data is inconclusive. The result hinges on the merger of several datasets,\nwhich increases the complexity of any statistical analysis, and the level of significance\nis small enough for it to simply be the result of a statistical fluctuation. This uncertainty\nwill soon be resolved \u2013 the next year of WMAP data will significantly improve the\nsensitivity of the measurements of the Cl for larger values of l, and the SDSS [Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey] will supplant the galaxy surveys used by the WMAP team in their\nprevious papers.\n\nRECONSTRUCTING THE POTENTIAL\nOne of the principal dreams of the theoretical cosmologist is to reconstruct the underlying physical mechanism of inflation. In general, this amounts to recovering the functional form of the potential. Even in a \"golden age\" this inverse problem remains enormously difficult. Several efforts have been made to develop a methodology for reconstructing the potential from its Taylor series, but these appear to be best by observational\ndifficulties [8]. More recently, Easther and Kinney developed Monte Carlo reconstruction, a stochastic approach to the problem based on generating a large number of \"trial\"\ninflationary models and isolating those for which the observable parameters coincide\nwith the window in parameter space permitted by the available data[20]. This approach\nbuilds on a thorough understanding of the \"flow equations\" [21], a consistent expansion\nof the inflationary dynamics.7 If the permitted window of parameter space is sufficiently\nnarrow the class of allowed potentials will be sufficiently well-defined that one can then\nproceed to estimate the functional form of the potential.\nThe WMAP team used a variant of Monte Carlo reconstruction [4]. This problem has\nbeen tackled in more detail by Kinney et al. [23], who find three classes of reconstructed\npotential, corresponding to the three subdivisions of the \"zoo plot\" shown in Figure 1.\nThis is of course expected, given that vanilla inflation remains consistent with the observational data. However, it is only with the release of WMAP data that the observational\nconstraints on inflationary theories are tight enough for this sort of calculation to return any non-trivial limits on the possible range of potentials which could have driven\ninflation.\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis paper has given a quick overview of theoretical cosmologists' response to the\nWMAP data. WMAP confirms what we already believed we knew \u2013 that the perturbations are correlated on super-horizon scales as a result of an inflation(like) mechanism, thanks to the observed anti-correlation between the temperature anisotropies and\n7\n\nSee also Liddle's recent paper [22].\n\n\fthe E-mode polarization signal. However, at present the observational evidence is not\ntight enough to rule out whole classes of inflationary models. Crucially, vanilla inflation\n\u2013 which is a limit of almost all inflationary models \u2013 remains viable. Since vanilla inflation is allowed, it follows that no classes of model can be excluded, even if certain\nparameter values can be ruled out within each class. I have reviewed the two hints in the\nWMAP data for a non-vanilla universe \u2013 the low quadrupole and the possible running\nscalar index \u2013 and sketched how these effects could change our understanding of the\nearly universe, and how future data is likely to constrain them more closely. In conclusion, though, it is clear that WMAP marks a profound change in the theoretical debate,\nand that the \"golden age\" of cosmology is upon us.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nI thank my Columbia colleagues Ted Baltz, Brian Greene and Will Kinney for many\nuseful conversations which helped me form the viewpoints expressed here, and I thank\nHiranya Peiris for several useful discussions about the WMAP results and their interpretation.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n10.\n11.\n12.\n13.\n14.\n15.\n16.\n17.\n18.\n19.\n20.\n21.\n22.\n23.\n\nC.
