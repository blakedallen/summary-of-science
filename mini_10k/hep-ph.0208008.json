This result supports the claim that the BRST\ninvariant Landau-gauge A2 condensate might play an important role in describing the QCD vacuum.\nP.A.C.S.: 12.38.Aw; 12.38.Gc; 12.38.Cy; 11.15.H\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nIn a series of lattice studies [1\u20134] the gluon propagator in QCD has been computed at large momenta, and it was\nshown that its behavior was compatible with the perturbative expectation provided a rather large 1/p2 correction was\nconsidered. In an OPE approach this correction has been shown [2,3] to stem from an A2 gluon condensate which\ndoes not vanish since the calculations are performed in the Landau gauge. It was also claimed [4] that this condensate\nmight be related to instantons.\nThe role of such a condensate in the non-perturbative properties of QCD, in particular its relation to confinement,\nhas been studied by several groups [5,6]. Of course any physics discussion about the A2 condensate necessitates a clear\ndefinition of what we speak about, i.e. it needs a well defined renormalisation procedure to define the renormalised\nlocal A2 operator, since A(0)2 is a quadratically divergent quantity as can easily be seen in perturbation theory.\nA renormalisation of A2 was defined in [2,3] within the OPE context which we now briefly summarise. It uses the\nnotion of \"normal order product\" in a \"perturbative vacuum\" which is annihilated by the fields A. It implies that\n<: A(0)2 :>pert = 0 in the perturbative vacuum\u2020 . The contribution to <: A(0)2 :> in the true QCD vacuum is then\nof non-perturbative origin. It has only logarithmic divergences and it is multiplicatively renormalised. Of course this\nnotion of a perturbative vacuum in which Fock expansion could be performed has not a very transparent physical\nmeaning especially in a non-perturbative context such as the numerical Euclidean path integral method.\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nUnit\u00e9 Mixte de Recherche du CNRS - UMR 8627\nThe symbol \": ... :\" represents the normal ordered product in this perturbative vacuum.\n\n1\n\n\fA2 is not a gauge invariant operator but the bare A2 condensate is a very special object since, by definition, it is a\nminimum of the gauge orbit [6]. In other words, some important physics seems to lie beneath the BRST invariance\nof A2 in Landau gauge. The authors of ref. [5] discussed on the generalised\u2021 composite operator A\u03bc A\u03bc + 2i\u03b1c\u0304c,\nwhich is BRST invariant in the manifestly Lorentz covariant gauge, and examined the survival of this invariance after\nrenormalisation. In this note, although in a different context, we also examine the same point: the subtle relationship\nbetween the minimum of bare A2 in the gauge orbit and any gauge-independant physical phenomenology associated\nto the renormalised condensate [6], emerging for instance from the OPE analysis [1\u20134]. To this aim, we will derive the\nrenormalised A2 vacuum expectation value without using the normal ordering but using only the OPE expansion of\nthe gluon propagator \u00a7 . It will provide a more transparent definition, related directly to a quantity which is actually\nmeasured.\nWe start from the observation that the non renormalised < A(0)2 > is related to the integral of the gluon propagator\nover momentum. Hence it is expected that the non-perturbative contribution to A2 has to do with the non-perturbative\ncontribution to the gluon propagator. The latter contains precisely 1/p2 contributions due to the A2 condensate at\nlarge momenta, and also strong deviations from perturbative QCD at small momenta, see fig. 1 (taken from [1\u20134]).\nHow does this fit together?\nII. BARE, PERTURBATIVE AND NON-PERTURBATIVE A2\n\nIt is possible in principle from lattice calculations to define the non-perturbative gluon propagator in the Landau\ngauge. Lattice calculations provide the bare gluon propagator. From the gluon propagator computed with a series\nof different values of the lattice spacing one can in principle compute the renormalised gluon propagator from zero\nmomentum up to as large a momentum as one wishes. An example of such a non-perturbative propagator is shown\nin fig. 1. We can choose for example the MOM renormalisation scheme\u2217\u2217 , such that\n(2)\n\nGR (p2 = \u03bc2 ) =\n\n1\n.\n\u03bc2\n\n(1)\n\nThis implies a renormalisation of the gluon fields\n(2)\n\n1\n\nZ3 (\u03bc) \u2261 \u03bc2 Gbare (\u03bc2 )\n\nA\u03bd R = Z3 (\u03bc)\u2212 2 A\u03bd bare ,\n\n(2)\n\nThe renormalisation constant Z3 has to be understood as related to any regularisation method and any value of the\nUV regulator provided that the latter is larger than the momenta carried by the gluons. The coupling constant is\nalso renormalised in the MOM scheme. The Yang-Mills theory is thus fully renormalised and from now on we will\nconsider only renormalised gauge fields and propagators.\nThe propagator is defined in Euclidean space by\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\np\u03bc p\u03bd\nb\n4\nip*x\na\n(3)\nd xe\n< A\u03bc R (0)A\u03bd R (x) >= \u03b4a,b \u03b4\u03bc,\u03bd \u2212 2 GR (p2 )\np\nInverting the Fourier transform,\nX\na,\u03bc\n\n\u2021\n\u00a7\n\n<\n\nAa\u03bc R (0)A\u03bca R (0)\n\n3(Nc2 \u2212 1)\n>=\n(2\u03c0)4\n\nZ\n\n4\n\nd\n\n(2)\npGR (p2 )\n\n3(Nc2 \u2212 1)\n=\n16\u03c0 2\n\nZ\n\n(2)\n\np2 dp2 GR (p2 )\n\n(4)\n\nLandau gauge is recovered in the limit \u03b1 \u2192 0\nOf course the normal ordering has been used in [2,3] to compute the anomalous dimension of A2 and the Wilson coefficient\n\nc2\n\u2217\u2217\n\nNotice that the chosen renormalisation scheme is not relevant in our argument in this paper, but we clearly need a scheme\nin which non-perturbative quantities coming from lattice simulations can be accommodated. MOM is one of the simplest. On\nthe contrary the MS scheme does not fulfill this condition.\n\n2\n\n\f3.0\nLattice Data\nOPE fit\n\n2.0\n\n2\n\n2\n\np GR(p )\n\n2.5\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n0.0\n\n2.0\n\n4.0\n\n6.0\n\n2\n\n8.0\n\n10.0\n\np\n\nFIG. 1. Gluon propagator extracted from lattice calculations renormalised at \u03bc = 10 GeV and plotted between 0 and 9 GeV.\nThe curve corresponds to the fit written in eq. (7). It results that the infrared cut-off pmin can be safely taken around 2.6 - 3.0\nGeV.\n\nThis integral is quadratically divergent in the ultraviolet. Indeed, if the gauge fields and the coupling constant have\nbeen renormalised, the local A2 operator has not yet. Let us introduce an ultraviolet cut-off \u039b and define\n3(Nc2 \u2212 1)\n< (AR (\u03bc)) >\u039b =\n16\u03c0 2\n2\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u039b2\n\n(2)\n\np2 dp2 GR (p2 ).\n\n(5)\n\n2\n\nwhere (AR (\u03bc)) refers to the square of the gauge fields renormalised at the scale \u03bc, but where A2 has not been\n2\nrenormalised as a local product of operators. The symbol \"< ... >\" represents the vacuum expectation value. (AR )\nis clearly an UV divergent quantity. The index \u039b refers to the ultraviolet cut-off and \u03bc to the renormalisation point\nfor the gauge fields and the coupling constant. The cut-off \u039b has nothing to do with the lattice cut-off a\u22121 . The\nrenormalisation in eqs. (1) and (2) has eliminated any dependence in the different lattice spacings which have been used\nto produce the renormalised propagator. \u039b is introduced simply to control the quadratic and logarithmic divergences\nwe encounter here.\nThe dominant contribution to this integral is the perturbative one. To separate the perturbative contribution from\nthe non perturbative we will now use the results of [3]\n\u0001\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\n< A2 R (\u03bc) > 1\np\np\np2 G(2) (p2 )\n2 (2) 2\n2\n, \u03b1(\u03bc) + c2\n, \u03b1(\u03bc)\n.\n(6)\np GR (p , \u03bc ) \u2261 2 (2) 2 = c0\n\u03bc2\n\u03bc2\n4(Nc2 \u2212 1)\np2\n\u03bc G (\u03bc )\nwhere G(2) (p2 ) is the bare propagator. This expansion does not exactly separate the perturbative form the nonperturbative contribution because of the denominator \u03bc2 G(2) (\u03bc2 ) which contains a non perturbative contribution.

Of course, we perform our analysis in the Landau gauge because of its conceptual [6]\nand numerical (Lattice Green functions [3]) particular interest. However the survival after renormalisation of BRST\ninvariance in covariant gauges for the generalised composite operator showed in ref.

CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION\n\nOur conclusion is summarised in\n2\n\n< A\n\n\u0001\n\nR\n\n(\u03bc) > \u2243 < (AR (\u03bc))\n\n2\n\n>OPE\n\u039b\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b1(\u039b)\n\u03b1(\u03bc))\n\n\u0013 b\u03b2\u03b30\n\n0\n\ni \u0012 \u03b1(\u039b) \u0013 b\u03b2\u03b300\nh\n2\n2\npert\n\u2243 < (AR (\u03bc)) >\u039b \u2212 < (AR (\u03bc)) >\u039b\n.\n\u03b1(\u03bc))\n\n(25)\n\nThe notations being not conventional let us recall that the < ... >\u039b 's in the r.h.s represent the gluon propagator\nintegrated over momentum up to an UV cut-off, \u039b, see eqs. (5) and (12). The gluon fields and coupling constants\nare renormalised in all the terms appearing in these equation. Thus we learn that the further renormalisation of the\nlocal operator A2 proceeds by substracting to the plain vacuum expectation value of A2 the same object computed in\nperturbation. This logarithmically divergent difference is then renormalised by the powers of \u03b1 in the r.h.s of eq. (25).\nNot unexpectedly, we retrieve in essence the initial expression of the renormalisation of the A2 operator through normal\nordering (i.e. subtraction of the perturbative v.e.v), followed by the multiplicative, logarithmic renormalisation ZA2 .\nBut apart from a non trivial consistency check, involving in particular the detailed expression of the Wilson coefficient,\nwe obtain an expression which is more transparent, since it only involves a measurable quantity, the integral over the\nrenormalised propagator.\nEq. (25) presents a separation between perturbative and non-perturbative contributions to the integrated propagator i.e. to A2 . Of course, such a separation depends on the renormalisation scheme, and on the order in perturbation\ntheory in which the Green functions are computed. It is also well known that summing to infinity the perturbative\nseries may generate renormalons which behave like non-perturbative condensates. To avoid any such problem we\nstick to a finite order in the perturbative series. Furthermore, if the quantitative separation between perturbative\nand non-perturbative contributions depends on these prescription, the results summarised in eq (25) do not depend\non them provided that we use the same scheme and order when computing both sides of eq. (25). Of course the\nanomalous dimensions to leading logarithms do not either depend on them.\nThis simple result has several interesting consequences. First, it has been advocated [4] that the A2 condensate\ncould be dominantly due to the contribution to the path integral of semi-classical gauge field configurations such as\ninstantons liquids. It is useful to consider this hypothesis through a background field picture, i.e. factorising the path\nintegral into an integral over semi-classical gauge field configurations, and for each value of these an integral over\nquantum fluctuations around this background configuration. It means that the hermitian matrix A\u03bc is decomposed\ninto:\nA\u03bc = B\u03bc + Q\u03bc (B)\n\nA2 = B 2 + {B.Q}+ + Q2 (B)\n\n(26)\n\nB\u03bc being the background, assumed to be non-perturbative, and Q\u03bc the quantum fluctuations assumed to be perturbative. {B.Q}+ \u2261 B.Q + Q.B. In principle, Q\u03bc depends on B\u03bc and differs from the quantum fluctuations\naround\n\u0001\nthe trivial vacuum B\u03bc = 0 which is what perturbative QCD computes. The hypothesis that < A2 R > is due \u2021\u2021 to\n\u0001\nthese semi-classical gauge configurations is translated into: A2 R \u2243 B 2 . From eqs. (25), (26)\n< A2\n\n\u0001\n\nR\n\n>\u2243< B 2 >\u2243< A2 > \u2212 < Q2 (B = 0) >\n\n(27)\n\ni.e. that (Q2 (B) \u2212 Q2 (B = 0)) is subleading\u00a7\u00a7 . In other words the dependence of Q\u03bc on B\u03bc is subleading. The hard\nquantum fluctuations are not sensitive to the soft background field.\nA most interesting consequence of our result is related to some discussions in [6]. These authors extend to QCD\nsome remarks stemming from compact U (1). They attribute a special role to the A2 condensate, even if a gauge\ndependent quantity, by arguing that A2 in the Landau gauge is the minimum of A2 on the gauge orbit. One difficulty\n\n\u2021\u2021\nThis discussion is qualitative and we do not know how to define rigorously the corresponding scale \u03bc. We therefore prefer\nto omit writing \u03bc here.\n\u00a7\u00a7\nIf B is a classical solution of the field equations, the term linear in Q will vanish. B should be close to such a solution and\nwe therefore neglect {B.Q}+ .\n\n6\n\n\fin this argument is the following: Fixing the Landau gauge amounts to minimize the < A2bare > while the condensate\nrefers to some renormalised quantity free of the quadratic and logarithmic divergences. In compact U (1) life is simpler:\n< A2bare >=< A2pert > + < A2nonpert >,\n\n(28)\n\nthe perturbative theory is trivial and the nonperturbative contribution is due grossly speaking to the topology. A phase\ntransition when the coupling constant varies allows to measure directly the non perturbative contribution. We refer\nto [6] for more details. Our result eq. (25) exhibits in QCD, up to subleading contributions, a linear decomposition\nsimilar to eq. (28), although such a similarity is not at all obvious at first sight. The next question could be whether\nin some sense the < A2 >OPE computed in the Landau gauge is the minimum of some quantity on the gauge orbit.\nLast but not least, let us simply say that the result in eq. (25) provides a fairly simple understanding of what the\nA2 condensate is. It confirms that indeed the O(1/p2 ) correction to perturbative QCD at large momenta has to do\nwith the A2 condensate. Indeed, if one start with some doubt about the relation of the r.h.s of eq. (13) with an A2\ncondensate, just considering it as an unidentified 1/p2 contribution, we end-up with the conclusion that it yields a\nnon-perturbative contribution to the A2 v.e.v. The fact that in our derivation this term has precisely the anomalous\ndimension of an A2 condensate comes form the fact that c2 in the r.h.s of eq. (13) has been computed under the\nassumption that it is due to an A2 condensate, an assumption which has been shown to fit fairly well the lattice data.\nHad we used another scale dependence for c2 we would have ended with a wrong scale dependence for the resulting\nnon-perturbative contribution to the A2 v.e.v. We would have also ended with a constant different from 1 in front of\nthe r.h.s of eq. (25), see the discussion following eq. (20). Thus the picture is fully consistent.\nIV.
