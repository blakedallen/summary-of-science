We derive the soft-fermion-pole (SFP) contribution to the\ntwist-3 single-spin-dependent cross section associated with the twist-3 quark-gluon\ncorrelation functions in the polarized nucleon. We find that the SFP can give rise to\na large effect to the asymmetry AN owing to the large partonic hard cross sections\nwith the large color factor, if the SFP function has a similar magnitude as the softgluon-pole (SGP) function, in spite of the absence of the \"derivative term\" for the\nSFP function unlike for the SGP function.\n\n1\n\n\f\u2191\n\u221a The large single transverse spin asymmetry (SSA) observed in p p \u2192 \u03c0X at FNAL\n( S = 20 GeV) [1] triggered lots of theoretical and experimental studies to clarify the\norigin of the asymmetry. (See [2] for a review.) In the conventional framework for the\nhigh-energy inclusive reactions, i.e., parton model and perturbative QCD, the asymmetry\nAN = (\u03c3 \u2191 \u2212 \u03c3 \u2193 )/(\u03c3 \u2191 + \u03c3 \u2193 ) is of the order of \u03b1s mq /pT where pT is the transverse momentum\nof the pion and mq is the mass of u and d quarks, and hence AN had been expected to be\nnegligible [3]. The transverse polarization of hyperons produced in unpolarized pp collisions\nwas another example of the unexpected large SSAs\n\u221a in early days [4]. More recently the large\nAN was also found at higher energy at RHIC ( S = 200, 62.4 GeV) [5, 6, 7]. HERMES and\nCOMPASS also reported large SSA in semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) [8, 9].\nUnderstanding of these SSAs requires the extention of the framework for QCD hard\nprocesses, and by now the mechanisms leading to such large SSA have been understood\nto some extent in terms of these new frameworks, which are often classified into two categories. One is the so-called \"T-odd\" distribution and fragmentation functions [10, 11] in\nthe transverse momentum dependent (TMD) factorization approach, and the other is the\ntwist-3 quark-gluon correlation functions in the collinear factorization approach [13, 14, 15].\nThe former approach has had phenomenological successes in the description of SSAs in various processes [12]. Universality property of the TMD functions have been also studied in\ndetail [16, 17, 18, 19, 20], while the factorization proof has been limited to e+ e\u2212 , SIDIS\nand Drell-Pan processes [21, 22, 23]. In the framework of collinear factorization SSA is a\ntwist-3 observable, and this approach is applicable to wider classes of processes including\np\u2191 p \u2192 \u03c0X, although its validity is limited to large pT region such that pT can be regarded\nas \"hard\". The formalism of calculating twist-3 single spin dependent cross section with\ntwist-3 distributions has been developed in [14, 15], in particular, gauge invariance and\nfactorization property of the cross section was proved in [15] in leading order QCD. So\nfar the formalism has been applied to SSA in Drell-Yan [14, 24, 27], SIDIS [15, 25, 26, 27],\np\u2191 p \u2192 \u03c0X [28, 29, 30, 31, 32], pp \u2192 \u039b\u2191 X [33, 34, 35], heavy-quark production in pp collision [36, 37] etc. Since SSA is a naively \"T-odd\" observable, it appears as an interference\nbetween the scattering amplitudes which have different complex phases. In the twist-3\nmechanism of SSA, this phase arises as a pole part of a relevant internal propagator in\nthe hard part, and those poles are classified as soft-gluon-pole (SGP), soft-fermion-pole\n(SFP) and hard-pole (HP). It is also shown in [27, 32] that the SGP contribution can be\nrelated to a certain twist-2 cross section in general. The connection between the TMD\napproach and the twist-3 approach at the intermediate region of the transverse momentum\nwas studied, and it's been shown that these two mechanisms provide a unique and consistent QCD description of SSA for the Drell-Yan and SIDIS [24, 26, 38]. Based on these\ndevelopments, we will study in this letter the SSA for p\u2191 p \u2192 \u03c0X in the framework of the\ncollinear factorization.\nThe cross section for pp \u2192 \u03c0X can be written as a convolution of two distribution\nfunctions associated with the initial protons, fragmentation function for the final pion, and\nthe corresponding partonic hard cross sections. In the twist-3 cross section, one of three\nnonperturbative functions becomes a relevant twist-3 function, and thus the single-spindependent cross section contributing to p\u2191 p \u2192 \u03c0X consists of three kinds of twist-3 cross\n\n2\n\n\fsections:\n\u2206\u03c3 tw3 \u223c G(3) (x1 , x2 ) \u2297 f (x\u2032 ) \u2297 D(z) \u2297 \u03c3\u0302A\n+ \u03b4q(x) \u2297 E (3) (x\u20321 , x\u20322 ) \u2297 D(z) \u2297 \u03c3\u0302B\nb (3) (z1 , z2 ) \u2297 \u03c3\u0302C ,\n+ \u03b4q(x) \u2297 f (x\u2032 ) \u2297 E\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the first, second and third factors in each contribution are, respectively, the polarized\ndistribution function in p\u2191 , unpolarized distribution in p and the fragmentation function\nfor the pion, and \u03c3\u0302A,B,C are the partonic hard cross sections. The two-variable functions\nb(3) (z1 , z2 ) are the twist-3 functions, and \u03b4q(x) is the transversity\nG(3) (x1 , x2 ), E (3) (x\u20321 , x\u20322 ), E\ndistribution in the nucleon. f (x\u2032 ) and D(z) are, respectively, usual twist-2 unpolarized\n(quark or gluon) distribution and fragmentation functions. The analysis of the first, second\nand the third term of (1) has been performed in Refs.[28, 31], [29] and [30], respectively. In\nthese analyses, only the SGP contributions have been included. Kouvaris et al. derived the\ncomplete SGP cross section for the first term and presented a phenomenological analysis\nof FNAL and RHIC data [31]. The second contribution was shown to be negligible due to\nthe smallness of the hard cross section \u03c3\u0302B [29]. This is because only particular diagrams\nare allowed to contribute due to the chiral-odd nature of the transversity and E (3) , which\nremains unchanged by the inclusion of the SFP contribution. In [30], the so-called \"derivab(3) (z, z) in the third contribution was analyzed,\ntive\" term of the SGP contribution from E\nand it was shown that this contribution can be as large as the first one if the nonperturbab (3) (z, z) has a similar order of magnitude as G(3) (x, x). Recently, however,\ntive function E\nb(3) (z, z) becomes identically zero, and thus\nit's been shown [39] that the SGP function E\nthe third term in (1) requires reanalysis including the non-partonic pole contribution from\nb (3) (z1 , z2 ). In this circumstance, we shall focuss in this letter on\n(i.e. imaginary part of) E\nthe analysis of the first contribution in (1), in particular, we will derive the complete cross\nsection formula including the SFP contribution together with the SGP cross section derived\nin [31].\nThere are two independent twist-3 quark-gluon correlation functions (for each quarkea (x1 , x2 ), in the transversely polarized nucleon contributing to\nflavor a), GaF (x1 , x2 ) and G\nF\nthe first term in (1).They are defined as (see eg.

The origin of this combination and the connection of \u03c3\u0302SGP to\nthe twist-2 cross section was clarified in [32]. Previous analyses focussed on the SGP term\nassuming it to be a dominant contribution, in particular, based on the observation that the\nSGP function receives enhancement by the \"derivative\" at large x [28]. However, there is no\neF (0, x) themselves are small, and its importance\nclue that the SFP functions GF (0, x) and G\n\u2032\ndepends on the behavior of the partonic hard cross sections \u03c3\u0302SFP and \u03c3\u0302SFP\n, even though it\ndoes not appear with the \"derivative\". The purpose of this letter is to investigate the SFP\ncontribution to p\u2191 p \u2192 \u03c0X. We will derive a complete twist-3 cross section formula for the\nSFP contribution and study its impact on AN in comparison with the SGP contribution,\neF (0, x) have the same order of magnitude\nassuming that the SFP functions GF (0, x) and G\nas the SGP function GF (x, x) [40].\nWe first recall the formula of calculating twist-3 cross section for p\u2191 (p, S\u22a5 ) + p(p\u2032 ) \u2192\n\u03c0(Ph ) + X following [15]. The contribution to the first term in (1) arises from the diagrams\nshown in Fig. 1, where the distribution function for the unpolarized proton (bottom blob)\nand the fragmentation function (middle small blob) for the pion are already factorized. Thus\nthe parton lines coming from the unpolarized proton have the momentum x\u2032 p\u2032 and the one\nfragmenting into the pion have the momentum Ph /z, which are collinear to the momenta\nof the parent hadrons.

In (a),\ntwo quark-lines coming from the polarized nucleon are in the opposite side of the cut, while\nin (b) they are in the same side of the cut. The bared internal line in each diagram generates\nSFP. Momentum for each line is defined as in Fig. 1 with ki = xi p. In this example, the\ncoherent gluon line can attach at three different places of each diagram without it, and\nthose three are represented by a single one shown in the right where the positions of the\ngluon-attachment are represented by the numbered dots (1),(2) and (3).\nFor the case of the SFP contribution, which is our main interest in this paper, x1 6= x2 and\none can use (7) in (6) to obtain\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nd3 \u2206\u03c3 SFP\n1\ndx\u2032\ndz\n\u03b1s2\nEh\ndx1 dx2\n=\n3\n\u2032\n2\ndPh\nS\nx\nz\nx1 \u2212 x2\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\nSFP\n\u2032 \u2032\n\u00d7Tr i\u03c9 \u03b2 MF (x1 , x2 )S\u03b1 (x1 p, x2 p, x p , Ph /z) f (x\u2032 )D(z),\n(9)\nwhere S\u03b1SFP (x1 p, x2 p, x\u2032 p\u2032 , Ph /z) is the hard part for the SFP contribution. This formula\nguarantees absence of the \"derivative\" term for the SFP contribution and provides a simpler\nmethod for the calculation compared with (6).\nTo obtain the SFP cross section, one needs to calculate the diagrams with an extra\ncoherent-gluon line as shown in Fig. 1 with ki = xi p (i = 1, 2). Those diagrams are\nclassified into two types, typical examples of which are shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2(a) shows\nthe diagrams where the extra gluon line is attached to the cut diagram representing a twist2 hard cross section. The line with a bar denotes the propagator generating a SFP. For\neach twist-2 diagram, there are three ways of attaching the coherent gluon, and thus we\ndenote the sum of those three diagrams by a single diagram as shown in the right side of\n6\n\n\fFigure 3: Diagrams for the SFP contribution of the type shown in Fig. 2(a) in the quark (or\nanti-quark) fragmentation channel with the unpolarized quark (or anti-quark) distribution.\nThe propagator with a bar gives an SFP. The parton c fragments into the final pion. The\nsolid vertical line without an arrow represents the final state cut. The mirror diagrams also\ncontribute.\nFig. 2(a) where three dots on the internal lines represent the places to which the gluon line\nis attached. The mirror diagrams of Fig. 2(a) also give rise to the SFP contribution, and\nshould be included in the calculation. Each of those mirror diagrams give the same result\nfor the SFP cross section as the original diagrams.\nThe diagrams shown in Fig. 2(b) have the quark and anti-quark lines from the polarized\nproton in the same side of the final-state cut, and the coherent gluon line is attached to the\nother side of the cut. Most of this type of diagrams are obtained by shifting the position of\nthe final-state cut in the diagrams shown in Fig. 2(a). For these diagrams, there are again\nthree ways of attaching the coherent gluon line, and we denote the sum of those three by\na single diagram with three dots shown in the right side of Fig. 2(b). For the SFP cross\nsection, some contributions in the same channel from the two types of diagrams shown\nin Figs. 2(a) and (b) cancel each other, as was the case for SIDIS [38], which makes the\ncalculation simpler [41].\nFigs. 3\u223c8 show the diagrams for the SFP contributions (S\u03b1SFP (x1 p, x2 p, x\u2032 p\u2032 , Ph /z) in\n(9)). Three or four dots numbered as (1) \u223c (4) in each diagram represent places where the\ncoherent gluon is attached as explained in Fig. 2. Some diagrams in the figures have 4 dots,\nsince the coupling of the coherent gluon through the 4-gluon vertex has to be taken into\naccount for those diagrams. In Figs. 3\u223c8, we have only shown the diagrams which represent\nea (0, x) with\nSFP partonic hard cross sections for the \"quark\" distribution GaF (0, x) and G\nF\nx > 0. By reversing the direction of the arrows of all the fermion lines in each diagram,\none obtain the hard cross sections for the \"anti-quark\" twist-3 distributions defined in (4).\nFigs. 3\u223c6 represent diagrams in the channels with quark or anti-quark distribution for\nthe unpolarized nucleon.

A remarkable feature of (10) is that the partonic\neF (0, x) are the same, even though each diagram in\nhard cross sections for GF (0, x) and G\nFigs. 3\u223c8 gives different contributions for the two functions. Accordingly, they appear\neF (0, x) in (10). Although we expect there is a reason\nin the combination of GF (0, x) + G\nfor this simple result, we do not understand the origin at this point. Another important\nfeature is that some terms in the hard cross section (the first terms in \u03c3\u0302ab\u2192c , \u03c3\u0302ab\u0304\u2192c , \u03c3\u0302ag\u2192c\netc.) have the same 1/t\u03023 behavior as the SGP hard cross section which gives dominant\ncontribution to AN in the forward region (xF \u2192 1). In addition their color factors are\ntypically N 2 = 9 times larger than those in the SGP cross section, making the magnitude\nof the SFP hard cross section huge. This suggests that the SFP contribution gives rise to a\nsignificant contribution to the asymmetry at large xF even though the SFP function does\nnot appear with the derivative.\nTo see the impact of the SFP contribution, we have performed a numerical calculation of\nAN for p\u2191 p \u2192 \u03c0X, assuming that the SFP function is of the same order of magnitude as the\nSGP function. Kouvaris et al. [31] have parametrized the SGP function GaF (x, x) so that\nthe SGP contribution reproduces the AN data obtained from RHIC and FNAL data. Their\nanalysis shows that both data are reasonably well reproduced. In particular, they found\nthat the derivative term in (5) brings dominant contribution compared to the nonderivative\na\na\nea\ncontribution. Here we adopt Fit(I) of [31] and\n\u221a assume GF (0, x) + GF (0, x) = GF (x, x)\n(a = u, d). Fig. 9 shows AN for the pion at S = 200 GeV and PhT = 1.5 GeV with\nand without SFP contribution. As is seen from the figure that the SFP contribution brings\nlarge effect in the positive xF region, while its effect is negligible in the negative xF region.\n12\n\n\f0.4\n\nAN\n2\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\ns = (200 GeV)\nPT =1.5 GeV\n\n+\n\n\u03c0 (SGP)\n+\n\n\u03c0 (SGP+SFP)\n-0.2\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c0 (SGP)\n\u2212\n\n\u03c0 (SGP+SFP)\n0\n\n-0.4\n-0.8\n\n\u03c0 (SGP)\n0\n\n\u03c0 (SGP+SFP)\n-0.6\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nxF\n\n\u221a\nFigure 9: AN for p\u2191 p \u2192 \u03c0X at S = 200 GeV and PhT = 1.5 GeV.

Dotted, short-dashed, and dash-double-dot lines are, respectively, AN for \u03c0 + ,\n\u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c0 0 obtained with both SGP and SFP contributions.\nThis is due to the large color factors for the 1/t\u03023 terms in \u03c3\u0302ab\u2192c , \u03c3\u0302ab\u0304\u2192c , \u03c3\u0302ag\u2192c as noted\nabove. From this figure it is clear that the SFP contribution can affect AN significantly\neven though it does not receive enhancement by the derivative unlike SGP contribution,\nunless the SFP function itself is small. The detail of the present calculation together with\na phenomenological analysis of the data will be presented elsewhere [41].\nTo summarize, we have calculated the SFP contribution to the cross section for p\u2191 p \u2192\nhX associated with the twist-3 quark-gluon correlation functions in the polarized nucleon.\nWe have also shown that its effect is significant and should be included in the analysis of AN .\nFor a more complete analysis, one needs to include the contribution from the triple-gluon\ntwist-3 distribution function as well. Recent study [36] shows that AN for the open charm\nproduction has a potential to determine the function. We hope that the global analysis of\nall those data including all the QCD effects will clarify the origin of observed SSA.\nAcknowledgement\nThe work of Y.
