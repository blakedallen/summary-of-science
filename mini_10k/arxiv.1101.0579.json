Consistent interpretation of the\nnature of intraspecific genetic variability is based on recognizing the limited sensitivity of\nstabilising selection, which allows for accumulation and persistence in the population of a\nconsiderable amount of mutational substitutions, which, to some degree, erase the meaningful\ngenetic information of the species. The proposed interpretation also provides solution to the\ninbreeding paradox in the invasive species.\n\n1. Introduction: Variability as adaptive potential, major lines of logic and evidence\nThe statement that intraspecific genetic variability represents the species' adaptive potential\nrepresents one of the ruling biological paradigms. It is based on the following consideration: the\nmore genetic variants are present in the population, the more chances the population has of\nsurviving if the environment changes.\nThe connection of this qualitative idea to empirical evidence seems to be most obvious in the\nrealm of artificial selection. On the basis of intraspecific genetic variability man selects for animals\nand plants with particular useful properties (e.g., high milk production). If we consider this selective\npressure as a sort of \"changing environment\", this means that only those populations survive which\nfeature high variability comprising the properties that are selected for. Individuals deprived of the\nneeded properties are artificially eliminated by man (\"external conditions\").\nThere is further a handful of other facts conventionally interpreted in favour of the paradigm,\nlike the textbook examples of industrial melanism or sickle cell anaemia. In the first case, in the\n1\n\n\fpopulation of butterflies that are polymorphic with respect to colour (dark- and light-coloured\nindividuals), dark individuals are considered to be better adapted to the environment of the\nindustrial regions where the ground surface is dirty and dark, as they are less conspicuous at this\nbackground than their light-coloured conspecifics. Sickle cell anaemia, a serious genetic disorder in\nhumans when homozygous, imparts to its heterozygous carriers some resistance against malaria,\nanother dangerous disease. The presumably adaptive nature of this polymorphism is involved to\nexplain the elevated frequency of sickle cell anaemia in those regions of Africa that are most\naffected by malaria.\nFinally, the significance of the intraspecific genetic variability for speciation is illustrated on\nthe examples of the so-called ring species, like, e.g., the gulls Larus fuscus and Larus argentatus.\nThese birds form a set of populations living around the Arctic ocean (Mayr, 1963; Green et al.,\n1989). The lesser black-backed gull L. fuscus is a common species in Western Europe. Its range\nextends east into the Russian Arctic through populations that are interbreeding but which can be\narranged into several subspecies, each slightly different. The easternmost subspecies is so far east\nthat it ultimately ranges again into Western Europe as the herring gull, where it exists alongside\nwith the lesser black-backed gull. But the herring gull does not interbreed with the lesser blackbacked gull in Western Europe and is called there Larus argentatus. These observations are\ninterpreted in that sense that the circumpolar environmental gradient, when acting upon the\nintraspecific genetic variability of L. fuscus, produced a new species, L. argentatus.\nSuch arguments, which, for over a century now, have been learnt by heart by every biology\nstudent, are considered to be sufficient to prove the adaptive significance of the intraspecific genetic\nvariability beyond any further doubt. As discussed below, the evidence contradicting this paradigm\nis either ignored or considered as a paradox, to which any possible explanation can be sought for,\nbut not the one questioning the paradigm itself.\n2. Evidence contradicting the paradigm\nGenetic variability is traditionally measured in relative units - heterozygosity H (the mean\nproportion of genetic loci by which two haploid genotypes randomly picked up from the population\ndiffer from each other) or polymorphism P (the proportion, among all loci studied, of variable loci\nfound in the population). Both H and P are always confined between zero and unity.\nHowever, natural selection acts upon, and selects among, individuals, not genetic loci.\nFollowing the same logic that supports the adaptive potential of variability, it is clear that it is the\nnumber of variable individuals that should matter for adaptation, not the number of variable loci per\nse. For example, if there is a population consisting of N = 2 individuals, whatever is the number of\n2\n\n\floci at which they differ, the number of different genotypes to be acted upon by natural selection is\nonly two. Generally, given that there are four different nucleotides in the DNA, the number of\npossible genotypes for a population with nucleotide heterozygosity H and genome size G is given by\n4GH. For the smallest eukaryote genome G ~ 107 base pairs and a conservative nucleotide\nheterozygosity H ~ 10\u22124 (Li & Sadler, 1991), the number of different genotypes is already 10200,\ngreatly exceeding the number of individuals in any population. This means that there are no\ngenetically identical individuals within any species. Hence, the number of different genotypes\npresent in the population is simply equal to the population size and, within broad limits, is\nindependent of heterozygosity. The maximum number of alleles of each particular gene locus that\ncan be simultaneously present in the population is also equal to population size.\nThus, if the intraspecific genetic variability represented the evolutionary adaptive potential\nof biological species, then, as far as in absolute terms it is highest in the largest populations, species\nfeaturing the greatest number of individuals should be able to adapt and evolve more rapidly than\nspecies consisting of a small number of individuals - the probability of finding an individual fitted\nto a particular environment is apparently higher when the choice is made among many, rather than\nfew, genetically different individuals.\nThe available paleoevidence, however, strongly contradicts this prediction, Table 1. For\nexample, in spite of the ten- to 10,000-fold difference in global species population numbers between\nrodents and mammalian carnivores, new species within both taxa appear every one-two million\nyears. At least a billion-fold difference exists between the global species population numbers of\nlizards and microscopic marine organisms (diatoms, dinoflagellates and foraminifers), yet\norganisms from these taxonomic groups all speciate every twenty million years on average. Neither\nthere is any considerable difference between speciation rates of insects and mammals, despite at\nleast a million-fold difference in abundances, Table 1.\nAlthough it is paradigmatically stated that more variable populations should be adapting and\nadapted better than less variable ones, no quantitative tests are proposed to check for the expected\ndifferences in the adaptive potential. Indeed, in what measurable variables should the expected\nbetter adaptation, associated with higher variability, be manifested? As we have shown on the basis\nof the speciation tempo data, Table 1, intraspecific genetic variability does not have any measurable\neffect on the ability of the various taxonomic groups to produce new species in the course of\nevolution.\nThe most important observation that has been made with regard to the organization of the\nliving world, namely that biological species, both extinct and extant, are discrete, also testifies\nagainst the adaptive potential of intraspecific variability. Since different genotypes of one and the\n3\n\n\fsame species represent a continuum of morphological forms, evolution based on the observed\nintraspecific variability would have been gradual, i.e. the ancient species would have been gradually\nintermingling into their evolutionary successors, instead of appearing in the chronological record in\nthe form of discrete morphological and genetic entities and persisting without any directional\nchange during most part of the species' life span as most species do (Stanley, 1979; Jackson, 1990;\nGould & Eldridge, 1993).\nThere are neither any indications that elevated genetic variability contributes to prosperity of\nthe extant species or that reduced genetic variability prevents from being prosperous. For example,\nwithin the class of insects the haplodiploid order Hymenoptera (bees, ants, wasps) is, together with\nthe diploid Coleoptera, Lepidoptera and Diptera, one of the four most species-rich and widelyspread orders with over 100,000 described species. At the same time, allozyme heterozygosity in the\nhaplodiploid Hymenoptera is almost three times lower than in the diploid orders. It is equal to H =\n0.05 \u00b1 0.001 (\u00b1 1 s.e., n = 64 species), compared to H = 0.13 \u00b1 0.02 (n = 15) in beetles and H = 0.14\n\u00b1 0.001 (n = 62) in butterflies (data from Nevo et al. (1984) and Graur (1985) analysed by Gorshkov\net al. (2000)).\nIn mammals, too, there is a wealth of examples of perfectly prosperous species with\nnegligibly low variability (Merola, 1994), as well as many cases where endangered species feature\nvery high variability. For example, among the 321 mammalian species with known allozyme\nheterozygosity studied by Makarieva (2001), Fig. 1, 42 species are characterised by allozyme\nheterozygosity not exceeding H = 0.01, which is five times lower than the mammalian average, H =\n0.05. Among these, there are many widely spread species like rodents Dipodomus, Peromyscus,\nSpermophilus, Rattus, which can be in no way characterised as endangered. Among the non-rodent\nspecies, some animals with low heterozygosity are indeed endangered like the famous cheetah\nAcinonyx jubatus, but others are quite numerous like, for example, the northern elephant seal\nMirounga angustirostris which, at the time of heterozygosity measurements, numbered over 30,000\nindividuals. This led the researchers to conclude that \"genic variability is not essential for the\ncontinued existence of animal species\" (Bonnel & Selander, 1974). Similar remarks with respect to\nother taxa are not uncommon in the literature, see, e.g., Bates & Zink (1982), but largely remain\nignored as they contradict the ruling paradigm. In the meantime, the critically endangered greater\none-horned rhinoceros Rhinoceros unicornis exhibits a high allozyme heterozygosity, H = 0.10,\ntwice the mammalian mean (Dinerstein & McCracken, 1990). Populations of the Przewalski horse\nfeature the highest allozyme heterozygosity ever recorded in mammals (H ~ 0.4) and are\ncharacterised by high juvenile mortality and decreased lifespan (Bowling & Ryder, 1987).\n\n4\n\n\fWith the on-going elimination of natural ecosystems in the course of civilisation growth, the\nmajority of the natural species affected either go extinct or are driven on the verge of extinction. A\nfew species, however, proved to be able to thrive in the anthropogenically transformed\nenvironments - these are, for example, urban cats, pigeons, sparrows, domestic rats, mice,\ncockroaches etc. Is there any evidence that these animals, viewed as successfully adapted within the\ntraditional paradigm, possess some extraordinarily high intraspecific variability that should have\npresumably allowed them to flourish in the changed environment, in contrast to other natural\nspecies who did not survive the human interference into their lifestyle? According to the available\nevidence, the answer is a unambiguous no, Table 2. All such species appear to be characterized by\nheterozygosity values well within the taxonomic range. The German cockroach Blatella germanica,\nwhich, following the humans, invaded the entire planet, posesses a vanishingly small variability, see\nTable 2 and Cloarec et al. (1999).\nIt can be concluded that the dogma of the indispensability of high intraspecific variability for\nadaptation and evolution does not reside on whatsoever quantitatively consistent empirical evidence\nbut, rather, is supported by the long-standing tradition per se and has been sustained by the apparent\nlack of scientific efforts to find a non-contradictory explanation for the observed patterns.\n3. Non-contradictory explanation of the intraspecific genetic variability\nOrganisms live and function in their natural environment, with which their morphological and\nbehavioural properties are rigidly correlated. Genetic information about the appropriate interaction\nwith the environment is written into the species' genome. When a new individual is produced, the\nparental genetic information has to be copied. During copying, some misprints (mutations)\ninevitably accumulate that erase the meaningful information of the normal genome. It is well-known\nthat the worst of these misprints are eliminated by the stabilising selection. However, it is\ntraditionally held that, by definition, mutations sustained in the population are not very harmful for\nindividuals and, hence, can represent their adaptive potential. The non-contradictory explanation,\ninstead, consists in admitting the limited sensitivity of the stabilising selection.\nEvery published book contains a certain number of misprints which nevertheless do not\nprevent the reader from wholly grasping the book's content. Similarly, a certain number of\nmutations can accumulate in the genome without being \"seen\" by the stabilising selection.\nIndividuals with genotypes differing from the normal species genome by less than a critical number\nnC of mutational substitutions, which characterizes the sensitivity of selection, are equally\ncompetitive in the population. However, similar to misprints, these mutations are all harmful for the\nspecies, representing the permissible level of erosion of the species' genetic information.\n5\n\n\fUnder distorted environmental conditions, most properties that in the natural environment\nimpart high competitive capacity to their carriers, appear useless. No longer eliminated by the\nstabilising selection, mutations start to accumulate in the genome beyond nC. The intraspecific\ngenetic variability grows. (Similarly, books published without a single misprint are all equivalent,\nwhile the more misprints, the more different from each other the individual books become, but\nacquire no additional information.) The accumulation of mutations beyond nC can occur up to the\nlethal threshold nL. Individuals with n > nL mutational substitutions in their genome are either lethal\nor infertile. When the environmental conditions degrade even further, the normal genome\ncompletely loses its meaning; the species undergoes gradual genetic degradation; the frequency of\nvarious genetic malformations increases.\nGenetic degradation of species in the distorted environment is a random chaotic process,\nwhen different genotypes with n > nC succeed each other approaching the lethal threshold. When\nselecting among the various malformations featured by individuals with n > nC, man can\noccasionally find some properties that, while prohibitive for the existence in the natural\nenvironment, can appear useful for man, e.g., the very large udders in the domestic cow, which\nimpede normal locomotion of the animal and would make it vulnerable to attacks of predators in the\nwild. Thus, artificial selection does not lead to appearance of new meaningful genetic information,\nbut, rather, represents a bizarre (from the nature's point of view) choice of particular malformations\nfeatured by individuals that have lost information about how to interact correctly with the\nenvironment and are genetically balancing on the verge of inviability. This explains why, in spite of\nthe fact that the genetic variability of artificially selected domestic mammals, Fig. 1, greatly exceeds\nthe minimum genetic distance between close mammalian species (Avise & Aquadro, 1982), no new\nspecies has ever originated in the course of artificial selection.\nWhile the species is genetically degrading and ultimately goes extinct in the distorted\nenvironment, in the succession of genotypes with n > nC some are eliminated later than the others.\nWhen a population of butterflies is degrading in the urban environment under the additional\npressure of carnivorous urban birds, the less-conspicuous, dark-coloured individuals can survive\nlonger than the light-coloured ones. However, this does mean that the dark-coloured individuals\nhave adapted better to the urban environment - they are simply the last to perish. This \"adaptation\"\nhas nothing to do with the ability of natural species to sustainably exist in their natural environments\nfor millions of years.\nIn very much the same manner as random misprints cannot transform the first book volume\ninto the second one, mutations erasing the genetic information of the species cannot facilitate\nbiological evolution, i.e. change of the meaningful genetic information. It is not surprising therefore\n6\n\n\fthat, as discussed in Section 2, the evolutionary tempo is not affected by the amount of intraspecific\ngenetic variability. At the same time, within the proposed framework it is easy to explain the ring\nspecies phenomenon.\nConsider two populations A and B of a species with the sensitivity of competitive interaction\nequal to nC, when individuals tolerate n \u2264 nC mutational substitutions in their genomes without loss\nof competitive capacity. While the total number of mutational substitutions in all populations of the\nspecies is, on average, the same, their localisation is, in the general case, different. The number of\nmutational substitutions nAB in the offspring produced by two individuals, one from population A\nand another from population B, is therefore on average confined between nC , when all mutational\nsubstitutions in the two populations are identical, and 2nC , when they are all different, Fig. 2, nC \u2264\nnAB \u2264 2nC . In the latter case, when nAB reaches its maximum, it can go beyond the lethal threshold\nnL, nAB \u2265 nL, and the progeny of individuals from two distant isolated populations will be inviable or\ninfertile, making successful interbreeding impossible. This fact, however, contrary to the traditional\ninterpretation, does not indicate formation of two new species A and B. Generally, the following\ncriterium can be formulated: if one genotype can be gradually turned to another genotype via a\nsuccession of viable forms, both genotypes belong to the same species. The notion of subspecies, to\nwhich no formal definition exists, most accurately corresponds to distant populations, hybridization\nbetween which yields inviable or infertile offspring, like the populations of Larus fuscus and L.\nargentatus.\n4. Inbreeding and genetic variability\nIn diploid organisms, mutations that affected a particular locus in the one copy of the genome can be\npartially or completely masked by the proper functioning of the intact, mutation-free locus of the\nsecond copy. Thus, the number nC of masked mutational substitutions that can be tolerated in a\ndiploid population should be much larger than the number of mutations tolerated in a haploid\npopulation, where all mutations are manifested. For example, allozyme heterozygosity of\nhaplodiploid insects (hymenopterans and thrips) is much lower than that of other insect orders\n(Graur, 1985; Crespi, 1991). Similarly, human autosomes that are always diploid are much more\nvariable than sex chromosomes that are effectively haploid (hemizygous) in males. Whereas\napproximately 1 in 560 bp is variant in the autosomal human DNA, the variability of the Xchromosomal DNA is only about 1 in 2,100 bp, while the variability of the Y chromosome (which is\nnever diploid) is less than 1 in 48,000 bp (Hofker et al., 1986; Jakubiczka et al., 1989; Malaspina et\nal., 1990; Dorit et al., 1995).\n\n7\n\n\fWhen closely related individuals interbreed, there is a high probability that their offspring\nbecome homozygous with respect to many mutational substitutions that remained heterozygous and,\nhence, masked in the parents. In the result, while the heterozygosity of the offspring, obviously,\ndecreases, the number n of unmasked deleterious mutational substitutions in the offspring grows\ndramatically beyond nC and towards the lethal threshold nL. Therefore, among the inbred offspring\nthere should be many individuals with significantly reduced biological performance (incompetitive,\nsusceptible to diseases, having reduced life span etc.). It is clear that inbreeding should produce\nmost negative effects in populations that have for a long time existed under unnatural conditions\nand, having accumulated a high number of deleterious substitutions, feature high genetic variability,\nlike domestic or laboratory populations (e.g., Drosophila). In Homo sapiens, the observed negative\nconsequences of inbreeding brought about the various cultural taboes on marriages of close\nrelatives. The necessity of these taboes testifies for the fact that in humans, like in all other animals,\nthere is no genetically encoded predisposition against inbreeding.\nThus, the inbreeding-related reduced biological performance has nothing to do with the loss\nof genetic variability per se, contrary to the explanation of this effect within the traditional\nparadigm. As discussed in Section 2, many species are perfectly prosperous with negligible\nvariability. (It should also be stressed that the low genetic variability in natural populations is not at\nall necessarily caused by inbreeding or bottleneck effects, but owes itself to the very sensitive\nprocess of natural selection, which, in some species, does not permit even the slightest degree of\nerosion of the normal genome.) Instead, the various malformations appearing in the course of\ninbreeding are due to the fact that the deleterious variation masked in the parental genomes becomes\nunmasked when homozygous in the inbred offspring. These effects once again prove the inherently\ndeleterious nature of the intraspecific genetic variability. Remarkably, consistent with our\nexplanation but unexplained within the traditional paradigm, there are no cases of inbreeding\ndepression reported for haploid species.\nThe inbreeding coin has also an opposite, positive side completely ignored in the traditional\nconsideration of this phenomenon. When the inbred offspring become homozygous, some of them\nbecome homozygous with respect to the deleterious mutational substitutions, while the others\nbecome homozygous with respect to the normal genome. Thus, inbreeding serves to purify the\nspecies genome, as it produces, along with individuals with various malformations (\"monsters\"),\nalso individuals completely freed from whatever genetic defects (\"geniuses\").\nAnother way of unmasking and eliminating the deleterious substitutions of the diploid\ngenome is to turn it into the haploid form. Such mechanisms of genome purification are widely used\nin nature. Due to the dramatic increase of n beyond nC and high rates of elimination of\n8\n\n\fincompetitive haploid individuals, the population numbers in the haplophase should be much larger\nthan in the diplophase, to ensure that normal haploid individuals with n < nC are always present.\nAccordingly, the number of spermatozoids in the haplophase of vertebrate species exceeds the\nnumber of diploid individuals by hundred million times. Similarly, the number of haploid males in\nthe haplodiploid insect species is much larger than the actual number of males needed to fertilise the\nqueen.\nThe proposed interpretation of the inbreeding phenomenon resolves the so-called inbreeding\nparadox in the invasive species (Allendorf & Lundquist, 2003; Frankham, 2005; P\u00e9rez et al.,\n2005a,b). Indeed, within the traditional paradigm it is impossible to explain how the invasive\nspecies, which by definition appear in the alien ecosystem in small numbers and, hence, are depleted\nof genetic variation, manage to \"adapt\" to the new environment. Provided that the founding couple\nproduces a large enough number of normal offspring (homozygous with respect to the normal\ngenome), the following generations of the invasive species are no less competitive than their\nconspecifics from the original population in the natural environment. The invasion success,\napparently unrelated to genetic variability, depends instead on the generality of the natural habits of\nthe invasive species. What is, from the antropocentric point of view, adaptation of an invasive\nspecies to a new environment, can be, from the point of view of the invasive species itself, just an\nextension of its range with no noticeable environmental change, if this species is genetically\nencoded to depend on but a few general environmental parameters.\n5. Conclusions\nWe have argued that intraspecific genetic variability arises due to the inevitable erosion of the\nmeaningful genetic information of the species during its copying. Genetic variability further persists\nin the population due to the limited sensitivity of the process of stabilising selection, which does not\n\"notice\" the deleterious changes until they accumulate in the genome in appreciable amounts.\nEvidence was presented that, in accordance with the proposed interpretation of genetic variability\nand contrary to its traditional consideration as species' adaptive potential, lack of genetic variation\ndoes not have any effect on the evolutionary success of biological species.\nIn the more general framework, the idea that in the course of evolution species have to adapt\nto the changing environment, is challenged by the rapidly accumulating evidence that the\nenvironment on Earth is under control of the biota itself, see, e.g., (Gorshkov et al., 2000; 2004). If\nthere is an optimal environment that has to be sustained, the program of how to do it should be\nwritten in the normal genomes of species composing the natural ecological community. If the\nenvironment changes, the species of the ecological community should initiate actions aimed at its\n9\n\n\frecovery to the optimum on the basis of their genetic program, instead of starting to change\ngenetically themselves. Hence, all facts testifying in favour of the biotic nature of environmental\nstability on Earth represent, in their essence, additional arguments against the adaptive potential of\nintraspecific genetic variability. Biodiversity can be saved in no other way than via the restoration\nand conservation of the natural ecosystems.\n\n10\n\n\fTable 1.

Genetic differences between different populations and subspecies of a single species\n(Gorshkov et al. (2000)).\nLet population A be the reference population. The species genome G is divided in a mosaic fashion\ninto two equal parts G1 and G2 in such a manner that all nC mutational substitutions (deviations\nfrom the normal genome) encountered in population A are located in the part G1, whereas the part\nG2 is free from decay substitutions. Dictated by the species-specific sensitivity of stabilising\nselection, the mean number of mutational substitutions in individuals in each population is close to\nnC, but their localisation in isolated populations is different. Let n1 and n2 be the number of\nsubstitutions in the G1 and G2 parts of the genome, respectively. While in population A all n\nsubstitutions are located in the part G1 of the species genome, n = n1 = nC, in other populations some\nmutational substitutions (n1) are located in the G1 part, while others (n2) in the G2 part of the species\ngenome, n = n1 + n2 = nC. Finally, there may be a population B where all the nC mutational\nsubstitutions are located in the part G2, n = n2 = nC. Hence, all populations and subspecies are\ndescribed by a straight line AB, each point of which corresponds to some particular localisation of\ndecay substitutions in the genome. The genetic equivalence of all populations and subspecies is\nmanifested by the fact that they are all equally close to the normal genome, the measure of distance\nbeing nC. The line parallel to AB corresponds to the lethal threshold nL. Hybridisation of individuals\nfrom two isolated populations a and b (point a\u00d7b) drives the number of mutational substitutions in\nthe offspring beyond the border AB (n > nC). Such offspring are viable but noncompetitive as\ncompared to normal individuals of both subspecies. Hybridisation of distant subspecies A and B\n(point A\u00d7B) yields inviable offspring. The difference between isolated populations and subspecies\nis purely quantitative.\n\n14\n\n\fReferences\nAllendorf FW, Lundquist LL (2003) Introduction: Population Biology, Evolution, and Control\nof Invasive Species.
