For (acceptor) molecules that exhibit a sufficiently\nbroad (quasi-)continuum of vibronic states, the energy\ntransfer may be regarded as being irreversible, and the\ntransfer rate can be calculated by using standard secondorder perturbation theory (see, e.g., [1] and references\ntherein). If instead of molecules, the donor and acceptor\nspecies are (two-level) atoms, the transfer can be reversed\nin principle, leading to a back-and-forth energy exchange\nbetween the atoms [2]. This process can be thoroughly\ndescribed by a nonperturbative treatment. When the interatomic interaction is weak, however, the probability\nof the return transfer can be so small that the energy\nexchange is essentially again a one-way process. In addition to that, the atoms always feature some natural\nlinewidths, which can be regarded as continua of states.\nAn aim of the present article is to establish the connection between the intermolecular energy transfer and the\nspontaneous-decay-assisted interatomic energy exchange.\nThe underlying mechanism of intermolecular and interatomic energy transfer can be both RDDI and RAFI\n[3]. In free space and for transfer distances R below the\nwavelength of real-photon emission, the RDDI described\nin terms of an instantaneous Coulomb interaction poten-\n\n\u2217 Proceedings\n\nof ICQO'2002, Raubichi, to appear in Optics and\nSpectroscopy\n\u2020 Also at Institute of Physics, National Center for Natural Sciences\nand Technology, 1 Mac Dinh Chi Street, District 1, Ho Chi Minh\ncity, Vietnam\n\ntial with the familiar R\u22123 distance law is typically considered as the leading mechanism. For transfer distances\nexceeding the wavelength of real-photon emission, the\nRDDI may be thought of as resulting from an extended\noff-resonant atom-field interaction, and the effect of the\nRAFI needs to be considered carefully. In particular,\nin the multipolar-coupling quantum electrodynamics [4],\nthe near-zone and far-zone results simply arise as limits\nof a unified theory based on the full atom-field coupling\n(in electric-dipole approximation).\nSimilar to the single-atom spontaneous decay, the interatomic energy exchange can be strongly affected by\nthe presence of material surroundings. While RDDI and\nRAFI in free space have been more or less well understood, there have been a number of open problems when\nmaterial surroundings are present. In particular, it is\nnot clear whether the near-zone R\u22123 law is still generally\nvalid. Another problem that needs investigation is the\nregime of strong RAFI, i.e., when suitably chosen material surroundings form a high-Q (micro-)resonator, which\ngives rise to a strong atom-field coupling accompanied by\nquantum Rabi oscillations. These and related problems\nhave recently been very actual in view of proposals to\nentangle atoms (see, e.g., [5]) and to implement quantum logic gates (see, e.g., [6, 7]), using atoms in a cavity,\nimpurities in the condensed phase, or quantum dots in a\nsemiconductor.\nFor two atoms that interact with cavity-type modes,\na Hamiltonian for treating both RDDI and RAFI was\nsuggested in [8]. In the Hamiltonian, an effective dipoledipole interaction energy, which may be thought of as resulting from a perturbative treatment of the off-resonant\natom-field coupling, is added to the exact on-resonant\natom-field interaction energy. Unfortunately, the relevant coupling strengths are introduced as parameters\nrather than physically determined system quantities.\nMoreover, the underlying mode expansion concept makes\nthe theory inapplicable for the realistic case of absorbing\n\n\f2\nand dispersing material surroundings. Inclusion of material absorption and dispersion is especially important in\ndesigning quantum computing systems where dissipation\nand decoherence have to be strictly kept under control.\nIn what follows we give a more rigorous approach to\nthe problem, basing on a recently developed quantization scheme for the electromagnetic field in the presence\nof (linear) absorbing and dispersing macroscopic bodies\n(see [9] and references therein). In this scheme, an operator noise polarization source is introduced into the\nMaxwell equations, and the electromagnetic field operators are given by a source-quantity representation in\nterms of the classical Green tensor and a continuous\nset of bosonic vector fields, which play the role of the\nfundamental variables of the composite system of the\nelectromagnetic field plus the media. The Green tensor, which can be calculated in a purely classical manner, is essentially determined by the (Kramers-Kronig\nconsistent) space- and frequency-dependent complex permittivity, which characterizes the relevant properties of\nthe macroscopic bodies. The medium-assisted electromagnetic field can then be coupled to additional atomic\nsystems, and the minimal-coupling Hamiltonian can be\nconstructed, from which the corresponding multipolarcoupling Hamiltonian can be derived by means of a unitary transformation.\nBy using the multipolar-coupling Hamiltonian in\nelectric-dipole approximation, in Section II an equation\nof motion for the reduced density operator of a system\nthat consists of two-level atoms and that part of the\nmedium-assisted electromagnetic field that resonantly interacts with the atoms is derived. It is shown that\nwhen the (shifted) atomic transition frequencies differ by\namounts small compared to the scale of the frequency\nvariation of the Green tensor, the system can be regarded\nas being governed by a Hamiltonian, with the RDDI being described by a well-defined effective interaction energy. The problem of resonant energy exchange between\ntwo two-level atoms is studied in Section III, with special\nemphasis on the rate regime. The spectrum of the light\nemitted during the energy exchange is considered in Section IV. Finally, some concluding remarks are given in\nSection V.\n\nII.\n\n\u2212\n\n\u221e\n\nXZ\nA\n\n0\n\nh\ni\nd\u03c9 d\u0302A \u00ca(rA , \u03c9) + H.c. ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\n\u2020\nd\u0302A = dA \u03c3\u0302A + d\u2217A \u03c3\u0302A\n\n(2)\n\nand\nZ\n~ \u03c92 3 \u2032 p\nd r \u03b5I (r\u2032 , \u03c9) G(r, r\u2032 , \u03c9)f\u0302 (r\u2032 , \u03c9).\n\u03c0\u03b50 c2\n(3)\nHere, f\u0302 (r, \u03c9) and f\u0302 \u2020 (r, \u03c9) are bosonic fields which play the\nrole of the fundamental variables of the electromagnetic\nfield and the medium, including a reservoir necessarily associated with the losses in the medium, G(r, r\u2032 , \u03c9) is the\nclassical Green tensor, and \u03b5(r, \u03c9) = \u03b5R (r, \u03c9) + i\u03b5I (r, \u03c9) is\nthe complex permittivity. There are no direct Coulomb\nforces between the particles in the multipolar-coupling\nHamiltonian (1); all interactions are mediated by the\nmedium-assisted electromagnetic field.\nWith regard to the interaction of the atoms with the\nelectromagnetic field, it is convenient to decompose the\nR \u2032\u221e\nlatter into an on-resonant part (denoted by 0 d\u03c9 . . .)\nR \u2032\u2032 \u221e\nand an off-resonant part (denoted by 0 d\u03c9 . . .). Let us\nconsider the temporal evolution of the system that consists of the atoms and the on-resonant part of the electromagnetic field. For this purpose we formally solve the\nHeisenberg equation of motion for f\u0302 (r, \u03c9) [and f\u0302 \u2020 (r, \u03c9)]\nand insert the result into the equation of motion for an\narbitrary system operator.

Secondly, it goes beyond\nthe rotating-wave approximation. Thirdly, it contains\na RDDI energy that is explicitly expressed in terms of\nthe medium-assisted Green tensor, according to Eq.

To give a simple example of\nthe effect of material absorption, let us assume that the\natoms are embedded in bulk material of complex permittivity \u03b5(\u03c9). Using the bulk-material Green tensor (see,\ne.g., [9]), from Eq.

In free space, Eq. (14) reduces to the wellknown result that the RDDI simply corresponds to the\n(near-field) Coulomb-type interaction. Note that though\nthe characteristic R\u22123 distance dependence observed in\nfree space is not changed by the bulk medium, it may be\nchanged by surroundings with more complex geometry.\nIn the long-distance limit, we find that\n\u0013\n\u0012\nc2\nd\u2217A R dA\u2032 R\n\u2217\n\u03b4 A\u2217 A\u2032 =\ndA dA \u2032 \u2212\n2\n4\u03c0~\u03b50 R\u03c9\u0303A\nR\nR\n\u2032\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03c9\u0303A\u2032 R\n\u03c9\u0303A\u2032 R\nexp \u2212nI (\u03c9\u0303A\u2032 )\n(15)\n\u00d7 cos nR (\u03c9\u0303A\u2032 )\nc\nc\np\n[n(\u03c9) = nR (\u03c9) + inI (\u03c9) = \u03b5(\u03c9)], i.e., the (harmonically\nmodulated) R\u22121 dependence observed in free space\nis changed to an exponential decrease according to\nexp[\u2212nI (\u03c9\u0303A\u2032 )\u03c9\u0303A\u2032 R/c] due to material absorption. Thus,\nmaterial absorption can drastically reduce the RDDI\nstrength with increasing mutual distance of the atoms.\nIII.\n\nRESONANT ENERGY EXCHANGE BY A\nTWO-ATOM SYSTEM\n\nA,A\n\n\u02c6 , we see that the motion of\nRecalling the definition of H\u0303\nS\nthe system is governed by the effective Hamiltonian\n\u0124eff =\n\nZ\n\n3\n\nd r\n\nZ\n\n\u2032\u221e\n\nd\u03c9 ~\u03c9 f\u0302 \u2020 (r, \u03c9)f\u0302 (r, \u03c9)\n\n0\n\n+\n\nX\n\n1\n2 ~\u03c9\u0303A \u03c3\u0302Az\n\nA\n\n\u2212\n\nXZ\nA\n\n0\n\n\u2032\u221e\n\n\u2212\n\nX\u2032\n\n\u2020\n~\u03b4A\u2217 A\u2032 \u03c3\u0302A\n\u03c3\u0302A\u2032\n\nA,A\u2032\n\nh\ni\nd\u03c9 d\u0302A \u00ca(rA , \u03c9) + H.c. , (13)\n\nwith \u00ca(rA , \u03c9) being given by Eq.

Here, |UA i is the atomic state with the\nAth atom in the upper state and all the other atoms in\nthe lower state, and |Li is the atomic state with all atoms\nin the lower state.

In order to get insight into\nthe atomic motion on the basis of closed solutions, let\nus consider two atoms and restrict our attention to the\nlimiting cases of weak and strong RAFI.\n\nA.\n\nWeak atom-field coupling\n\nIn the weak coupling regime, the integral expression\nin Eqs.

The latter may happen, e.g., when the\natoms A and B have different dipole matrix elements\nand/or different dipole orientations. It is then not difficult to solve Eqs. (17).

This\ncan typically be observed when the atoms are sufficiently\nnear to each other, but can also be realized for more moderate distances with the interatom coupling being mediated by a high-Q medium-assisted field resonance [11].\nIn the opposite limit of weak resonant dipole-dipole coupling, PA (t) decreases monotonously while PB (t) features\none peak which separates the regime of energy transfer\nfrom atom A to atom B at early times and the subsequent decay of the excited state of atom B.\nPA(B) (t) =\n\n1\n2\n\nB.\n\nRate regime\n\nAs already mentioned, for weak RDDI the energy\ntransfer is one-way; that is, from atom A to atom B.\nIn this case, a transfer rate w1 can be defined according\nto\nw1 =\n\ndPB (t)\ndt\n\n,\n\n(28)\n\nt0\n\nwhere t0 is determined from the conditions that\nd2 PB (t)\nd2 t\n\n= 0,\nt0\n\ndPB (t)\ndt\n\n> 0.\n\n(29)\n\nt0\n\nFrom Eq.

With increasing\nvalue of \u0393B \u2217 B an increasing discrepancy between w1 and\nw is observed. The reason can be seen in the fact that\nthere are two processes which simultaneously drive atom\nB: the energy transfer from A to B and the spontaneous\ndecay. Hence, w1 is actually the rate of both processes\ncombined, not the bare rate of energy transfer. This explains why w1 is typically smaller than w and why the\ndiscrepancy between them becomes more substantial for\nenhanced spontaneous decay of atom B. To roughly compensate for the first effect, the ratio w1 /w may be multiplied by exp(\u0393B \u2217 B t0 ). The values of the so corrected\nratio are then \u2243 1 for the cases (i) and (iii), and \u2243 0.74\nfor the case (ii).\nC.\n\nStrong atom-field coupling\n\nFor the sake of transparency, we again consider identical atoms that have equivalent positions and dipole orientations with respect to the material surroundings so\nthat Eqs.

(42) in a closed\nform in a similar way as in the single-atom case [14, 15].\nIn particular for exact resonance, i.e., \u03c9m = \u03c9\u0303A \u2213 \u03b4A\u2217 B ,\nwe derive\n1\n\nC\u00b1 (t) = 2\u2212 2 e\u2212\u2206\u03c9m t/2 cos(\u03a9\u00b1 t/2)\n(\u03a9\u00b1 \u226b \u2206\u03c9m ), where\np\n\u03a9\u00b1 = 2\u0393\u00b1 \u2206\u03c9m ,\n\n\u0393 \u00b1 = \u0393 A\u2217 A \u00b1 \u0393 A\u2217 B\n\n(44)\n\n(45)\n\nwith \u0393A\u2217 A and \u0393A\u2217 B being defined according to Eq.

For the probability amplitudes of the remaining states |\u2213i, which are weakly\ncoupled to the field, we obtain\n1\n\nC\u2213 (t) = 2\u2212 2 e\u2212\u0393\u2213 t/2\n\n(46)\n\n(\u03a9\u2213 \u226a \u2206\u03c9m ).

(48) \u2013 (53) the following time-averaged probabilities P\u0304A , P\u0304B , and P\u0304L = 1 \u2212 P\u0304A \u2212 P\u0304B are obtained, with\nthe respective time integral being taken over one cycle.\n(i) P\u0304A = P\u0304B = 12 and P\u0304L = 0. The excitation energy is\nperiodically exchanged between the two atoms through\nvirtual field excitations exclusively. (ii) P\u0304A = 85 , P\u0304B = 18 ,\nand P\u0304L = 82 . The two exchange channels \u2013 one channel\nthrough virtual and the other one through real field excitations \u2013 compete with each other and destructively\ninterfere, leading to a partial trapping of the excitation\nenergy in atom A. (iii) P\u0304A = P\u0304B = 38 , P\u0304L = 82 . The interatom energy exchange is dominantly mediated by real\nfield excitations.\nIV.\n\nPOWER SPECTRUM\n\nLet us finally address the problem of the influence of\nthe RDDI on the power spectrum of the light emitted\nduring the decay-assisted energy exchange.

Equation (57) reveals that the RDDI\nmay result in a doublet structure (two asymmetric lines\nat \u03c9\u0303A \u2213 \u03b4A\u2217 B , with \u0393\u00b1 and |FA \u00b1 FB |2 being the widths\nand weights respectively). The line separation is seen\nto be twice the RDDI strength. A system of two twolevel atoms, one of them initially excited, is obviously\nequivalent to a three-level system with two upper dressed\nstates |\u00b1i. The doublet structure can be understood as\na result of the transitions of the dressed states to the\nground state.\nAs can be seen from Eq. (57), an experimental observation of the doublet structure of the emitted light requires\na delicate balancing act. The interatomic distance should\nnot be too large to provide a reasonable level splitting,\nbut it should not be too small to avoid |FA | = |FB |, i.e.,\nquenching of one of the two lines. It is worth noting that\nthe presence of macroscopic bodies may facilitate the detection of the doublet, because it offers the possibility\nof realizing strong RDDI even for interatomic distances\nmuch larger than the wavelength.\nAnother interesting feature is that, according to\nEq. (45), either \u0393+ or \u0393\u2212 can be much smaller than\n\u0393A\u2217 A (= \u0393B \u2217 B ). That is, the resonant dipole-dipole interaction can give rise to an ultranarrow spectral line,\nalbeit each time at the expense of the other line of the\npair. If, e.g., a single atom is placed sufficiently near a\nmicrosphere, its spontaneous decay may be suppressed,\nwith the emission line being accordingly narrowed. Com-\n\npared to the emission line of a single atom, one line of\nthe doublet observed for two atoms being present may\nbe further narrowed by several orders of magnitude [11].\nThe RDDI-induced asymmetric splitting of the power\nspectrum is illustrated in Fig. 1 for two atoms near a\nmicrosphere. The solid line in Fig. 1 corresponds to an\noff-resonant atomic transition with not too strong RDDI\nand moderate contrast between \u0393+ and \u0393\u2212 . As the\natomic transition frequency \u03c9\u0303A approaches (from the offresonance side) the frequency, where the absolute value\nof the RDDI strength reaches its maximum, the two spectral lines move apart from each other, with one of them\ngradually getting so much broaden that it eventually disappears (dashed and dotted lines). As \u03c9\u0303A shifts further\ntowards the resonance line center, the RDDI weakens\nwhile the contrast between \u0393+ and \u0393\u2212 increases even\nmore. As a result, the singlet structure persists with the\npeak moving back to the central position (not shown).\n\nB.\n\nStrong atom-field coupling\n\n\u22126\n\nPower spectrum\n\n\u22126\n\n\u221213\n\n10\n\n2x10\n\n\u221213\n\n10\n\n2000\n\n\u221210\n\n2100\n\n2200\n\n10\n\n\u221214\n\n10\n\n-2000\n\n0\n\n\u2206\u03c9S /\u03930\n\n2000\n\n3\nFIG. 2: The power spectrum S[64\u03c0\u03b50 c3 \u03930 /(3~\u03c9\u0303A\n)] in the\nstrong coupling regime for the three sets of parameters [\u03930 =\n10\u22126 \u03c9T , \u03a9+ \u2243 128 \u03930 ; (i) \u03c9\u0303A = 1.04835747 \u03c9T , R \u2243 0.01 \u03bbT ,\n\u03b4AB \u2243 \u2212 2129 \u03930 (solid line); (ii) \u03c9\u0303A = 1.05045444 \u03c9T , R \u2243\n0.027 \u03bbT , \u03b4AB \u2243 \u2212 32.2 \u03930 (dashed line); (iii) \u03c9\u0303A = \u03c9m =\n1.0504867 \u03c9T , R = 20.04 \u03bbT , \u03b4AB \u2243 0] (dotted line).

These lines separated by\n\u03a9\u00b1 have equal widths (which are solely determined by\nthe width of the medium-assisted field resonance) and\nequal weights. Note that their width and weight are different from those of the third line, which is closely related\nto a line of the doublet observed for weak RAFI. From\nEq. (60) it is also seen that, depending on the point of\nobservation, this line or the strong-coupling-assisted doublet can be suppressed due to the interference effects.\nThe effect of strong RAFI on the spectrum of the emitted light is illustrated in Fig. 2 for two atoms near a microsphere. Three typical situations are shown, namely\n(i) strong, (ii) moderate, and (iii) weak RDDI (cf. Subsection III C). Note that the triplet structure is most\npronounced in the first case.\nV.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nWe have developed a fully quantum mechanical theory to describe both RDDI and RAFI in the presence\nof arbitrarily configured dispersing and absorbing material bodies. In particular, the concept of RDDI works\nwell for arbitrary atom-field coupling strengths. Though\nboth the single-atom level shifts and the RDDI strengths\nresult from the off-resonant atom-field interaction and\nare formally given by the similar-looking Eqs.

Kn\u00f6ll, S. Scheel, and D.-G. Welsch, in Coherence and\n\n(10), respectively, Eq. (9) applies only to the level shifts\ncaused by the scattering part of the Green tensor. The\nlevel shifts that are related to the vacuum field fluctuations have to be dealt with separately due to the divergence of the real part of the vacuum Green tensor\nat equal positions. In our calculations, they have been\nthought of as being already included in the bare atomic\ntransition frequencies. By contrast, the real part of the\nGreen tensor at different positions is finite and Eq. (10)\ncan thus be used to calculate the total RDDI strengths\ncaused by both vacuum and scattered-field fluctuations.\nIn the same context, it might be incorrect to apply the\nrotating-wave approximation in the study of the RDDI.\n+\nWhile the (scattering-assisted) level shifts \u03b4A\n\u2217 A , which\nresult from counterrotating terms, are small in general\n[cf. Eqs. (7) and (9)], the corresponding RDDI strengths\n+\n\u03b4A\n\u2217 A\u2032 (A6=A\u2032 ) can be significant, especially when the mutual distances of the dipoles are very small [cf. Eq. (10)].\nTo demonstrate the usefulness of the theory, we have\napplied it to the problem of resonant energy exchange\nbetween two atoms. In particular, we have shown that\nthe RDDI can give rise to spectral line splittings of the\nlight emitted during the decay-assisted energy exchange\nprocess. With a locally excited dipole as a probe, the\neffect may be employed, e.g., in imaging single atoms\non a surface by scanning near-field optical microscopy\ntechniques. The (numerical) calculations performed for\natoms near a microsphere can of course be extended to\nother geometries of the material surroundings such as\nplanarly stratified or cylindrical objects. It should also\nbe mentioned that the theory is also readily extendable\nto the case of externally driven atoms.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.\n\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n\nStatistics of Photons and Atoms, edited by J.
