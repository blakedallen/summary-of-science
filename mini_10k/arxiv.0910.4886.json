We study the automorphisms of graph products of cyclic groups, a class of groups that\nincludes all right-angled Coxeter and right-angled Artin groups. We show that the group of automorphism generated by partial conjugations is itself a graph product of cyclic groups providing its\ndefining graph does not contain any separating intersection of links (SIL). In the case that all the\ncyclic groups are finite, this implies that the automorphism group is virtually CAT(0); it has a finite\nindex subgroup which acts geometrically on a right-angled building.\n\n1. Introduction\nClassically, a collection of groups can be combined using free products or direct products. More\ngenerally, a graph product of groups is a class of groups which interpolates between these. Let \u0393\nbe a finite simplicial graph with vertex set V and let {Gv }v\u2208V be a family of groups. Then the graph\nproduct G\u0393 is the quotient of the free product of the groups Gv obtained by adding commutator\nrelations between Gv and Gw whenever v, w are adjacent in \u0393. A discrete graph \u0393 gives the free\nproduct of the Gv and a complete graph gives the direct product. Graph products encompass several\nimportant classes of groups. In particular, one obtains the class of right-angled Coxeter groups by\nrequiring each Gv be isomorphic to Z/2Z and the class of right-angled Artin groups when each Gv\nis isomorphic to Z. In this paper we require only that the vertex groups be finitely generated abelian\ngroups. Any such graph product is isomorphic to a graph product of cyclic groups, hence we can\nrestrict our attention to the latter.\nThe automorphism groups of right-angled Coxeter and right-angled Artin groups have been\nstudied extensively in the literature (see, for example, [23], [20], [14], [18], [5], [6], [2], [11]).\nAutomorphisms of more general graph products were considered by Laurence in his thesis [19].\nBuilding on work of Servatius [21], Laurence describes a finite generating set for Aut(G\u0393 ) in the\ncase when all vertex groups have the same order, either infinite or a fixed prime p. More recently,\nin [15], Gutierrez, Piggott, and Ruane begin a unified treatment of the automorphism group of\na general graph product of cyclic groups, and in [7], Corredor and Gutierrez extend Laurence's\ngenerating set to all such graph products.\nThe automorphism group of G\u0393 is generated by four types of automorphisms: graph symmetries,\nvertex isomorphisms, transvections, and partial conjugations. The first two types generate a finite\nsubgroup. Transvections, which map v 7\u2192 vw (or v 7\u2192 wv) for a pair of vertices v, w, are familiar to\nthose who work with free group automorphisms. Indeed, the automorphism group of a free group is\nentirely generated by these transvections. For graph products, however, the transvections are more\nrestricted (in some cases excluded entirely) and the partial conjugations play an essential role.\nR. Charney was partially supported by NSF grant DMS 0705396.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nRUTH CHARNEY, KIM RUANE, NATHANIEL STAMBAUGH, AND ANNA VIJAYAN\n\nPartial conjugations are defined as follows. Given a vertex v \u2208 V, let lk(v) denote the full\nsubgraph of \u0393 spanned by the vertices adjacent to v and st(v) the subgraph spanned by v and lk(v).\nFor each connected component C of \u0393 \\ st(v), the partial conjugation \u03c0v,C conjugates all of the\ngenerators in C by v and leaves all other generators fixed.\nThe subgroup of Aut(G\u0393 ) generated by the partial conjugations is denoted Aut pc (G\u0393 ) and will be\nour main object of study. In the case where all vertex groups have finite order, this subgroup has\nfinite index in the full automorphism group Aut(G\u0393 ). This is also true for some graph products with\ninfinite vertex groups, namely those for which the structure of \u0393 does not permit any transvections\n(eg., if \u0393 has no circuits of length less than four and no valence one vertices).\nA simplicial graph \u0393 has a Separating Intersection of Links (SIL) if for some pair v, w with\nd\u0393 (v, w) \u2265 2, there is a component of \u0393 \\ (lk(v) \u2229 lk(w)) which contains neither v nor w. Our main\ntheorem, Theorem 3.6, states that if \u0393 has no SILs, then Aut pc (G\u0393 ) is itself a graph product of cyclic\ngroups.\nTo prove this, we consider the graph \u0393\u0303 whose vertices are in one-to-one correspondence with\nthe partial conjugations \u03c0v,C of G\u0393 . Two vertices of \u0393\u0303 are connected by an edge if the two partial\nconjugations commute, thus we have a graph product of cyclic groups G\u0393\u0303 . In the case where \u0393 has\nno SILS, we prove that Aut pc (G\u0393 ) is isomorphic to G\u0393\u0303 . The main technical point is to characterize\nexactly when two partial conjugations commute. Under the no SILS assumption, we give a simple\ncharacterization of when \u03c0v,C and \u03c0w,D commute in terms of the relative position of C and D. This\nis the content of Lemma 3.4.\nOur main theorem has some interesting geometric implications. Recall that a CAT(0) metric\nspace is a proper, complete metric space in which each geodesic triangle is \"at least as thin\" as\nthe Euclidean triangle with the same side lengths. We say that a finitely generated group G is a\nCAT(0) group if G acts properly, cocompactly by isometries on a CAT(0) metric space (such an\naction is said to be geometric). A group G is virtually CAT(0) if some finite index subgroup of G\nis CAT(0). Note that extending a geometric action from a finite index subgroup to the full group is\nhighly non-trivial. It is unknown if virtually CAT(0) groups are CAT(0).\nIn Section 2, we show that any graph product of cyclic groups G\u0393 acts on a right-angled building.\nRight-angled buildings are always CAT(0) by a theorem of Davis [9]. If the vertex groups are all\nfinite, then the associated building is locally finite, its automorphism group is a locally compact\ngroup, and the graph product sits as a uniform lattice in this group. In particular, G\u0393 is a CAT(0)\ngroup. (For a discussion of right-angled buildings and their lattices see [22] and [1].) If some\nvertex group is infinite cyclic, then the action is no longer proper. However, if all the vertex groups\nare infinite (the right-angled Artin group case), then there is a different CAT(0) cube complex, the\nSalvetti complex, which can be used to get a CAT(0) structure on G\u0393 .\nOur main theorem implies that under the no SILs hypothesis, Aut pc (G\u0393 ) is itself a graph product\nhence also acts on a right-angled building. Moreover, we show that this action extends to the larger\ngroup generated by partial conjugations, graph symmetries and vertex isomorphisms. If all of the\nvertex groups are finite, these generate a finite index subgroup of Aut(G\u0393 ) and we conclude that\nAut(G\u0393 ) is virtually CAT(0). (This last statement also follows from [15] where they show that under\nthese hypotheses, the inner automorphism group has finite index in Aut(G\u0393 ). Our construction gives\na CAT(0) action of a much larger subgroup, sometimes encompassing the entire automorphism\ngroup.)\n\n\fTHE AUTOMORPHISM GROUP OF A GRAPH PRODUCT WITH NO SIL\n\n3\n\nOne would like to know whether, in general, these actions can be extended to the full automorphism group Aut(G\u0393 ), that is, whether the action can be extended to include transvections. This\nwould almost certainly require a different geometric construction as transvections do not behave\nwell with respect to the geometry of the cube complexes given here. Even in the case of rightangled Coxeter and Artin groups, it is unknown whether the full automorphism groups are CAT(0).\n2. Graph products and associated geometries\nIn this section we discuss graph products and their associated geometries. We begin with a\ndefinition of a graph product.\nDefinition 2.1. Let \u0393 be a finite, simplicial graph with vertex set V, together with a labeling of each\nvertex by a group Gv . Let F\u0393 denote the free product of all the vertex groups Gv , v \u2208 V. Then the\ngraph product G\u0393 is the quotient group of F\u0393 obtained by adding commutator relations between\nGv and Gw whenever v, w are connected by an edge in \u0393.\nIn this paper we investigate graph products of cyclic groups, that is, graph products for which all\nof the vertex groups Gv are cyclic. More generally, if all of the vertex groups of a graph product G\u0393\nare finitely generated abelian groups, then G\u0393 is naturally isomorphic to the graph product obtained\nby replacing each vertex in \u0393 by a complete graph with vertices labelled by the (indecomposable)\ncyclic summands of Gv . Thus, our results apply more generally to this class of groups.\nGutierrez and Piggott [13], generalizing work of Laurence [19], have shown that for any graph\nproduct of indecomposable cyclic groups, the graph \u0393 and the vertex groups Gv are uniquely determined by the isomorphism class of G\u0393 . Thus, when referring to the graph product G\u0393 , we may\nassume that this data has been specified.\nFor the remainder of the paper, we assume that all vertex groups are cyclic.\nExamples 2.2. If all of the vertex groups are cyclic of order 2, then we obtain the right-angled\nCoxeter groups. If all of the vertex groups are infinite cyclic, then we obtain the right-angled Artin\ngroups.\nGiven g \u2208 G\u0393 , a reduced word for g is a minimal length word g1 g2 . . . gk in F\u0393 (with each gi\nbelonging to some vertex group) representing g. Any word representing g can be reduced by a\nprocess of \"shuffling\" (i.e., interchanging commuting elements) and combining adjacent elements\nfrom the same vertex group. Any two reduced words representing g differ only by shuffling [12].\nFor any subset T of the vertex set V, let GT denote the graph product associated to the full\nsubgraph of \u0393 spanned by T . The natural map from GT into G\u0393 splits, hence GT is isomorphic to\nits image and we make no distinction between them. By convention, we set G\u2205 = 1.\nTo a graph product G\u0393 , we associate a cubical complex X\u0393 as follows. Define two sets, partially\nordered by inclusion,\nS\u0393 = {GT | T \u2286 V, GT is abelian}\n\u001b {T | T \u2286 V, T spans a complete subgraph of \u0393}\nGS\u0393 = {gGT | g \u2208 G\u0393 , T \u2286 V, GT is abelian}.\n\n\f4\n\nRUTH CHARNEY, KIM RUANE, NATHANIEL STAMBAUGH, AND ANNA VIJAYAN\n\nLet X\u0393 be the geometric realization of the poset GS\u0393 and let K \u2282 X\u0393 be the geometric realization\nof S\u0393 . Left multiplication of G\u0393 on this poset induces an action of G\u0393 on X\u0393 . A fundamental\ndomain for this action is K, and hence the action is cocompact. The stabilizer of the vertex gGT is\nconjugate to GT which is finite if and only if all the vertex groups in T are finite. Thus, the action\nof G\u0393 on X\u0393 is proper if and only if \u0393 is a graph of finite cyclic groups.\nThe complexes X\u0393 are interesting in their own right. As we will now show, they have the structure of right-angled buildings. These buildings are based on a construction of Davis [10], [9]. In\nthe case of a right-angled Coxeter group, XG is the well-known Davis complex. For a right-angled\nArtin group, X\u0393 is known as the Deligne complex (or in the terminology of [4], the \"modified\"\nDelinge complex). We follow [8] and [1] for basic definitions.\nFirst recall that a chamber system over a set S is a set \u03a6 of chambers together with a family of\nequivalence relations on \u03a6 indexed by S . For s \u2208 S , we say two chambers are s-adjacent if they\nare s-equivalent, but not equal. For a word w = s1 . . . sk , si \u2208 S , a gallery of type w is a sequence\nof chambers \u03c60 , \u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6k such that \u03c6i\u22121 is si -adjacent to \u03c6i .\nNow suppose S is the generating set of a right-angled Coxeter group W. A W-valued distance\nfunction on \u03a6 is a function d : \u03a6 \u00d7 \u03a6 \u2192 W such that, given a reduced word s1 . . . sk representing\nw \u2208 W, there exists a gallery of type s1 . . . sk from \u03c6 to \u03c6\u2032 if and only if d(\u03c6, \u03c6\u2032 ) = w.\nDefinition 2.3. Let W = W\u0393 be a right-angled Coxeter group with generating set S . Then a rightangled building of type W is a chamber system \u03a6 over S such that\n(1) for all s \u2208 S , every s-equivalence class contains at least two chambers,\n(2) there exists a W-valued distance function d : \u03a6 \u00d7 \u03a6 \u2192 W.\nLet G\u0393 be a graph product of cyclic groups. Denote by W\u0393 the right-angled Coxeter group\nobtained by replacing each vertex group Gv by Wv = Z/2Z. Define a set-theoretic map (not a\nhomomorphism) \u03b3 : G\u0393 \u2192 W\u0393 as follows. For g \u2208 G\u0393 , represent g by a reduced word g = g1 . . . gk ,\nwith gi \u2208 Gvi , and set \u03b3(g) = s1 s2 . . . sk where si is the generator of Wvi . This is well-defined since\nany two reduced words for g are related by commutator relations which also hold in W\u0393 . Moreover,\ns1 . . . sk is also reduced since no shuffling of g1 . . . gk (and hence of s1 . . . sk ) allows two elements\nof the same vertex group to be combined.\nTheorem 2.4. For any graph product G\u0393 of cyclic groups, X\u0393 is a right-angled building of type\nW\u0393 .\nProof. We take \u03a6 to be the set of translates of K in X\u0393 and we say that two chambers gK, hK are\nsi -equivalent if g\u22121 h \u2208 Gvi . Then every si -equivalence class contains q elements where q = |Gvi |.\nDefine d : \u03a6 \u00d7 \u03a6 \u2192 W\u0393 by d(gK, hK) = \u03b3(g\u22121 h). Then for a reduced word w = s1 s2 . . . sk ,\nthere exists a gallery of type w from gK to hK if and only if g\u22121 h = g1 . . . gk for some gi \u2208 Gvi , or\nequivalently, d(gK, hK) = w.\n\u0003\nThese buildings and their automorphism groups are studied by Barnhill, Thomas, Haglund, and\nPaulin [22], [1], [16], [17]. If the vertex groups are all finite, then the (full) automorphism group\nof the building is a locally compact topological group and G\u0393 is a uniform lattice in this group.\nAlthough X\u0393 was defined as a simplicial complex, it has a natural cubical structure whose cubes\ncorrespond to \"intervals\". For a pair of subsets T 1 \u2286 T 2 in S\u0393 , the interval [GT 1 , GT 2 ] is the\n\n\fTHE AUTOMORPHISM GROUP OF A GRAPH PRODUCT WITH NO SIL\n\n5\n\nsubcomplex of K spanned by the vertices GT , T 1 \u2286 T \u2286 T 2 . It is combinatorially a cube of\ndimension |T 2 \u2212 T 1 |. The translates of these intervals give a cubical structure on all of X\u0393 .\nThe fundamental chamber K is independent of the orders of the vertex groups. Thus, it is\nisometric to the fundamental chamber in the Davis complex for W\u0393 . It was shown by Davis in [9]\nthat any such right-angled building is CAT(0) with respect to the cubical metric described above.\n(This can also be proved directly for X\u0393 using the link condition for cubical complexes.)\nThe action of G\u0393 takes intervals to intervals, hence preserves the cubical metric and the quotient\nby G\u0393 is just the fundamental chamber K. Thus G\u0393 acts faithfully (the stabilizer of G\u2205 is trivial),\ncocompactly by isometries on X\u0393 . As noted above, however, the action is proper if and only if\nevery vertex group is finite.\nCorollary 2.5. For all graph products of cyclic groups, the cubical metric on X\u0393 is CAT(0). If the\nvertex groups are all finite, then G\u0393 is a CAT(0) group.\nRemark 2.6. For use later in the paper, we remark that this action can be extended to a slightly\nlarger group. Let \u03a3\u0393 be the (finite) group of automorphisms of G\u0393 generated by symmetries of the\ngraph \u0393 (which permute the generators of G\u0393 ) and automorphisms of a single vertex group. This\ngroup acts on the poset GS\u0393 in the obvious way, \u03c3 * gGT = \u03c3(gGT ), and hence it acts on X\u0393 .\nCombining this with the G\u0393 -action gives an action of the semi-direct product G\u0393 \u22ca \u03a3\u0393 on X\u0393 . This\naction is again proper, cocompact, isometric, and faithful.\n3. Automorphism groups and separating intersections of links\nIn this section we introduce the no SILs condition on \u0393 and study automorphism groups of graph\nproducts of cyclic groups G\u0393 satisfying this condition.\nServatius [21] and Laurence [18], [19] described a finite generating set for Aut(G\u0393 ) for certain\nclasses of graph products, such as right-angled Artin groups. This result has recently been extended\nto all graph products of cyclic groups by Corredor and Gutierrez in [7]. We now describe this\ngenerating set.\nIn order to simplify notation, we will think of the vertex v as the generator of the cyclic group\nGv , so that the vertex set V generates G\u0393 . Denote the order of v (and hence of Gv ) by |v|. Associated\nto a vertex v in \u0393 are two subgraphs: the link of v, lk(v), is the full subgraph spanned by the vertices\nadjacent to v and the star of v, st(v), is the subgraph spanned by v and lk(v).\nTheorem 3.1 ([18], [7]). If G\u0393 is a graph product of cyclic groups, then Aut(G\u0393 ) is generated by\nautomorphisms of the following types:\n(1) Symmetries: induced by symmetries of \u0393, permute the generators\n(2) Vertex isomorphisms: automorphisms of a single vertex group Gv\n(3) Partial conjugations: conjugate all of the generators in one connected component C of\n\u0393 r st(v) by v\n(4) Transvections: map v 7\u2192 vwk or v 7\u2192 wk v where one of the following holds\n(a) |v| = \u221e, k = 1, and lk(v) \u2286 st(w), or\n(b) |v| = pi , |w| = p j , k = max{1, p j\u2212i }, and st(v) \u2286 st(w).\nWe are interested primarily in the partial conjugations. Denote by \u03c0v,C the partial conjugation\nby v of the component C, and let Aut pc (W\u0393 ) denote the group generated by all partial conjugations.\n\n\f6\n\nRUTH CHARNEY, KIM RUANE, NATHANIEL STAMBAUGH, AND ANNA VIJAYAN\n\nFigure 1. A graph with separating stars but no SILs\nIt follows from Lemma 2.8 of [15] that when the vertex groups are all finite, Aut pc (W\u0393 ) has finite\nindex in the full automorphism group Aut(G\u0393 ). This is also the case when there are no permissible\ntransvections (for example when \u0393 has no cycles of length less than 5 and no vertices of valence\nless than 2).\nThe interaction between two partial conjugations \u03c0v,C and \u03c0w,D depends on the relative position\nof the components C and D. A crucial role will be played by the following.\nDefinition 3.2. A simplicial graph \u0393 has a Separating Intersection of Links (SIL) if for some pair\n(v, w), with d\u0393 (v, w) \u2265 2, there is a component of \u0393 r (lk(v) \u2229 lk(w)) which contains neither v nor w.\nRemark 3.3. The no SILs condition is most interesting for connected graphs. For if \u0393 has more\nthan two connected components, then it necessarily has a SIL. If it has two components \u03931 and \u03932 ,\none of which is not a complete graph, then it also has a SIL since if v and w are vertices in \u03931 with\nd(v, w) \u2265 2, then \u03932 \u2282 \u0393 r (lk(v) \u2229 lk(w)) is a component containing neither v nor w. Thus a graph\nwith no SILs is either connected or it is the disjoint union of two complete graphs.\nIn the case where \u0393 has no SILs, we will prove that Aut pc (G\u0393 ) is itself a graph product of cyclic\ngroups G\u0393\u0303 where the vertex set of \u0393\u0303 corresponds to the set of partial conjugations. The edges of\n\u0393\u0303 will correspond to the partial conjugations that commute, and are prescribed by the following\nlemma.\nLemma 3.4. Suppose \u0393 is a connected simplicial graph which does not contain any SILs and let v\nand w be vertices of \u0393. Suppose d(v, w) \u2265 2, and let C0 be the component of \u0393 r st(v) containing\nw, and D0 be the component of \u0393 r st(w) containing v. Then\n(1) Every component of \u0393 r st(v), except C0 , lies entirely in D0 , and every component of \u0393 r\nst(w), except D0 , lies entirely in C0 .\n(2) The partial conjugations \u03c0v,C and \u03c0w,D commute unless C = C0 and D = D0 .\nProof. (1) Let C be a component of \u0393 r st(v). If C contains any vertex of lk(w), then it also contains\nw, so C = C0 . If not, then C \u2229 st(w) = \u2205, so C lies completely in some component D of \u0393 r st(w).\nWe claim that D = D0 .\nLet C\u0304 denote the graph generated by C and the vertices adjacent to C. Clearly C\u0304 r C \u2282 lk(v).\nOn the other hand, C\u0304 r C 1 lk(v) \u2229 lk(w), since this would imply that C was a component of\n\u0393 r lk(v) \u2229 lk(w) which did not contain v or w. It follows that C and v are adjacent to a vertex which\nis not in the link of w. Hence C and v are in the same component of \u0393 r st(w), i.e., D = D0 as\nclaimed.\n\n\fTHE AUTOMORPHISM GROUP OF A GRAPH PRODUCT WITH NO SIL\n\n7\n\nv6\npv6 ,{v1 ,v2 ,v3 ,v4 }\n\nv5\n\nv2\n\npv4 ,{v6 }\n\npv4 ,{v1 ,v2 }\n\nv4\nv3\n\npv5 ,{v1 ,v2 ,v3 }\n\n=\u21d2\n\npv3 ,{v5 ,v6 }\n\npv3 ,{v1 }\npv2 ,{v4 ,v5 ,v6 }\n\npv1 ,{v3 ,v4 ,v5 ,v6 }\n\nv1\nFigure 2.

The vertices of \u0393\u0303 are in one-to-one correspondence with the\npartial conjugations \u03c0v,C , and are denoted by \u1e7c = {pv,C }. Any two vertices pv,C and pw,D are\nconnected by an edge unless d(v, w) \u2265 2, v \u2208 D, and w \u2208 C. We assign to the vertex pv,C the cyclic\ngroup of order |v|. An example is shown in Figure 2.\nBy the lemma, there is a homomorphism \u03c6 : G\u0393\u0303 \u2192 Aut pc (G\u0393 ) which takes pv,C 7\u2192 \u03c0v,C . This\nhomomorphism is clearly surjective; our goal is to prove that if \u0393 contains no SILs, then \u03c6 is an\nisomorphism. To do this, we will pass to the outer automorphism group.\nThe outer automorphism group of G\u0393 is the quotient of Aut(G\u0393 ) by the subgroup Inn(G\u0393 ) of\ninner automorphsims of G\u0393 . The inner automorphism by a vertex v is the product of all the partial\n\n\f8\n\nRUTH CHARNEY, KIM RUANE, NATHANIEL STAMBAUGH, AND ANNA VIJAYAN\n\nconjugations by v, hence this subgroup lies in Aut pc (G\u0393 ) and we can define Out pc (G\u0393 ) accordingly.\nWe would like to define a corresponding quotient for G\u0393\u0303 .\nThe inner automorphism group is isomorphic to the group modulo its center. In the case of G\u0393 ,\nthe center is generated by the vertices (if any) which are connected to every other vertex in \u0393. Let \u2206\nbe the (possibly empty) graph generated by these vertices and let \u03930 = \u0393 r \u2206. Then G\u0393 decomposes\nas the direct product of G\u2206 and G\u03930 , so\nQ Inn(G\u0393 ) is isomorphic to G\u03930 .\nWe denote by pv the product pv = pv,C over all components C of \u0393 r st(v), so that \u03c6(pv ) is the\ninner automorphism by v.\nLemma 3.5. The correspondence v 7\u2192 pv induces a homomorphism f \u0303 : G\u03930 \u2192 G\u0393\u0303 and the image\nof f \u0303 is a normal subgroup of G\u0393\u0303 .\nProof. The first statement follows by definition of \u0393\u0303 since if d(v, w) \u2264 1 in \u0393, then pv,C commutes\nwith pw,D for all C, D, so commuting relations are preserved and the order of pv is |v|.\nTo prove that the image is normal, we will show that for any v \u2208 \u03930 and for any generator of\npw,D of G\u0393\u0303 , the following equation holds.\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nif v < D\n\uf8f2 pv\n\u22121\npw,D pv pw,D = \uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u22121\n\uf8f3 pw pv pw\nif v \u2208 D\n\n \u0303\nNote that in either case, pw,D pv p\u22121\nw,D is in f (G \u03930 ).\nCase 1: v < D. Then by Lemma 3.4 pw,D commutes with pv,C for every C.\n\u2032\nCase 2: v \u2208 D. Consider the expression pw pv p\u22121\nw . Then for each connected component D of\n\u2032\n\u0393 r st(w) with D , D , the partial conjugation pw,D\u2032 commutes with pv by Lemma 3.4. Simplifying\nthe expression, we get the desired result.\n\u0003\nIn light of the lemma, we can now form the quotient group, Q = G\u0393\u0303 / f \u0303(G\u03930 ). If f denotes the\ninclusion of the inner automorphisms into Aut pc (G\u0393 ), then the diagram below clearly commutes.\nf \u0303\n\nG \u03930\n\nG\u0393\u0303\n\u03c6\n\n\u001b\n\nInn(G\u0393 )\n\nf\n\nAut pc (G\u0393 )\n\nIt follows that f \u0303 is injective and that \u03c6 induces a map on the quotient groups, so we have a\ncommutative diagram of exact sequences,\n1\n\nf \u0303\n\nG \u03930\n\nInn(G\u0393 )\n\ng\u0303\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u001b\n\n1\n\nG\u0393\u0303\n\nf\n\nAut pc (G\u0393 )\n\nWe are now ready to state and prove our main result.\n\nQ\n\n1\n\n\u03c8\ng\n\nOut pc (G\u0393 )\n\n1\n\n\fTHE AUTOMORPHISM GROUP OF A GRAPH PRODUCT WITH NO SIL\n\n9\n\nTheorem 3.6. Let G\u0393 be a graph product of cyclic groups whose defining graph \u0393 contains no\nSILs. Then the map \u03c6 : G\u0393\u0303 \u2192 Aut pc (G\u0393 ) is an isomorphism. In particular, Aut pc (G\u0393 ) is a graph\nproduct of cyclic groups of the same order(s) as the vertex groups of G\u0393 .\nProof. In light of the exact sequence above, it suffices to prove that the map \u03c8 on the quotient\ngroups is an isomorphism. The theorem will then follow from the 5-lemma. Since \u03c6 and g are both\nsurjective, \u03c8 \u25e6 g\u0303 = g \u25e6 \u03c6 is surjective, and so \u03c8 is as well.\nSuppose \u0393 is connected. We first argue that Q is abelian. Take two generators pv,C and pw,D \u2208\nG\u0393\u0303 which do not commute. By Lemma 3.4, we know that pv,C does commute with pw,D\u2032 for\nevery connected component D\u2032 of \u0393 r st(w) with D\u2032 , D, hence it commutes with the product\nQ\np\u2032 = D\u2032 ,D pw,D\u2032 . But p\u2032 and pw,D represent inverse elements in Q, so the images of pv,C and pw,D\ncommute in Q.\nSince Q is abelian, for any x\u0304 \u2208 Q, we can write x\u0304 as a product of generators pv,C in which all\noccurrences of a vertex v appear together. That is, we can choose a representative x \u2208 G\u0393\u0303 of the\nform\nYY k\nv,C\nx=\npv,C\n.\nv\n\nC\n\nQ Q kv,C\nNow suppose x\u0304 \u2208 ker(\u03c8). By the commutivity of the relevant diagram, \u03c6(x) = v C \u03c0v,C\nlies in\nInn(W\u0393 ). A product of this form is an inner automorphism if and only if, for fixed v, the power\nQ\nkv,C is the same for every component C of \u0393 r st(v). This means that x has the form v pkvv , which\nis clearly in G\u03930 , thus x\u0304 is trivial in Q. We conclude that the kernel of \u03c8 is trivial, so \u03c8 is an\nisomorphism.\nIt remains to consider the case when \u0393 is not connected. By Remark 3.3, this occurs only when\n\u0393 is the disjoint union of two complete graphs. In this case, every partial conjugation is an inner\nautomorphism, so \u0393 = \u0393\u0303, and since G\u0393 has trivial center, Aut pc (G\u0393 ) = Inn(G\u0393 ) \u001b G\u0393 .\n\u0003\nAs noted in Section 2, any graph product of finitely generated abelian groups is isomorphic to a\ngraph product of cyclic groups obtained by \"blowing up\" a vertex v with group Gv into a complete\ngraph with vertices labeled by the indecomposable cyclic summands of Gv . Applying Theorem\n3.6 to this new graph product, we see that Aut pc (G\u0393 ) is again a graph product of cyclic groups.\nMoreover, this graph product is just the blow-up of G\u0393\u0303 (where \u0393\u0303 is defined as above, but the vertex\ngroups Gv are no longer cyclic). Thus we may restate the theorem as follows.\nTheorem 3.7. Let G\u0393 be a graph product of finitely generated abelian groups whose defining graph\n\u0393 contains no SILs. Then the map \u03c6 : G\u0393\u0303 \u2192 Aut pc (G\u0393 ) is an isomorphism. In particular, Aut pc (G\u0393 )\nis also a graph product of finitely generated abelian groups.\nWe remark that the proof of the theorem above also gives an independent proof of the following\nresult of [15].\nCorollary 3.8 ([15]). Assume \u0393 is connected. Then Out pc (G\u0393 ) is abelian if and only if \u0393 contains\nno SILs.\nProof. In the proof of the main theorem we showed that if \u0393 has no SILs, then Q, and hence\nOut pc (G\u0393 ), is abelian. If \u0393 has a SIL, that is a component C of \u0393 r (lk(v) \u2229 lk(w)) containing neither\n\n\f10\n\nRUTH CHARNEY, KIM RUANE, NATHANIEL STAMBAUGH, AND ANNA VIJAYAN\n\nv nor w where d(v, w) \u2265 2, then it is straightforward to check that the commutator [\u03c0v,C , \u03c0w,C ] is\nnot an inner automorphism. Hence Out pc (G\u0393 ) is not abelian.\n\u0003\n4. Geometric implications\nRecall that a group G is a CAT(0) group if it acts geometrically (i.e., properly, cocompactly\nby isometries) on a complete CAT(0) space. It is an open question whether automorphism groups\nof graph products, even in the Coxeter group case, are CAT(0) groups. Theorem 3.6 gives some\npartial answers.\nIn the case where all vertex groups are finite, Aut pc (G\u0393 ) has finite index in Aut(G\u0393 ) so by Theorems 2.4 and 3.6 we obtain\nCorollary 4.1. Let G\u0393 be a graph product of finite cyclic groups whose defining graph has no SILs.\nThen the automorphism group Aut(G\u0393 ) is virtually CAT(0). More precisely, there is a faithful,\ngeometric action of Aut pc (G\u0393 ) on the right-angled building X\u0393\u0303 .\nIt would be nice to extend this action to the whole automorphism group. Recall from Theorem\n3.1 that Aut(G\u0393 ) is generated by four types of automorphisms: symmetries, vertex isomorphisms,\npartial conjugations, and transvections. Letting \u03a3\u0393 denote the group generated by symmetries and\nvertex isomorphisms, the subgroup of Aut(G\u0393 ) generated by the first three types of automorphisms\nis a semi-direct product, Aut pc (G\u0393 ) \u22ca \u03a3\u0393 . We can easily extend the action of Aut pc (G\u0393 ) on X\u0393\u0303 to\nthis larger group.\nCorollary 4.2. Let G\u0393 be a graph product of finite cyclic groups whose defining graph has no SILs.\nThen the action of Aut pc (G\u0393 ) on X\u0393\u0303 extends to a faithful, geometric action of Aut pc (G\u0393 ) \u22ca \u03a3\u0393 .\nProof. By Remark 2.6, the action of G\u0393\u0303 on X\u0393\u0303 extends to a faithful, geometric action of the semidirect product G\u0393\u0303 \u22ca \u03a3\u0393\u0303 . The group \u03a3\u0393 embeds naturally in \u03a3\u0393\u0303 (an isomorphism of Gv goes to\nthe product of the corresponding isomorphisms of G pv,C for all components C). Combining this\nembedding with the isomorphism \u03c6\u22121 , we get an inclusion Aut pc (G\u0393 ) \u22ca \u03a3\u0393 \u0592\u2192 G\u0393\u0303 \u22ca \u03a3\u0393\u0303 , and hence\nan induced action on X\u0393\u0303 .\n\u0003\nIf some of the vertex groups are infinite cyclic, then the action of G\u0393\u0303 on X\u0393\u0303 is not proper.\nHowever, if all of the vertex groups are infinite, then G\u0393 and G\u0393\u0303 are right-angled Artin groups\nand we can use a different geometric construction, the Salvetti complex (see [3]), to get an action\non a CAT(0) space.\nCorollary 4.3. Let \u0393 be a simplicial graph with no SILs, and suppose G\u0393 is a right-angled Artin\ngroup. Then the subgroup of Aut(G\u0393 ) generated by partial conjugations, inversions and graph\nsymmetries acts faithfully and geometrically on a CAT(0) cube complex, the Salveti complex of G\u0393 .\nProof. It is easy to show that the action of A\u0393\u0303 on its Salvetti complex extends to an action of A\u0393\u0303 \u22ca\u03a3\u0393\u0303 .\nThe proof then proceeds as above.\n\u0003\nWe close by remarking that some graph products G\u0393 of cyclic groups do not permit transvections in which case the subgroup in Corollaries 4.2 and 4.3 constitutes the entire automorphism\ngroup. This is the case, for example, if \u0393 has no triangles and no vertices of valence less than two,\nor if every pair of adjacent vertex groups have relatively prime order. For those that do permit\n\n\fTHE AUTOMORPHISM GROUP OF A GRAPH PRODUCT WITH NO SIL\n\n11\n\ntransvections, the action described above does not extend in any natural way to an isometric action\nof the transvections. In this case, proving that the full automorphism group is CAT(0) will almost\ncertainly require a different space.\nReferences\n[1] A. Barnhill and A.
