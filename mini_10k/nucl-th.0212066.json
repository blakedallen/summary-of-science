INTRODUCTION\n\nData of elementary nucleon reactions involving a neutron in the entrance channel are\nscarce. One can use, for instance, a tagged neutron (n) beam [1] impinging on a proton (p)\ntarget or a proton beam impinging on a nuclear target. In the latter case one needs models\nto deconvolute the pn reaction. Here we are interested in threshold-near meson production.\nOver the last decade the data basis for the pp reactions has been impressively improved [2].\nSuch a detailed knowledge of elementary hadron reactions is necessary for analyzing heavyion collisions. Threshold-near meson production is also interesting for testing predictions of\nQCD in the non-perturbative region, provided e.g., by chiral perturbation theory. While it\nseems to be straightforward to translate cross sections for reactions of the type pp \u2192 ppM\n(M is a meson) into the cross section nn \u2192 nnM, the channel pn \u2192 pnM is less simple\naccessible. Model calculations point to a non-trivial energy dependence of the ratio \u03c3(pp \u2192\nppM)/\u03c3(np \u2192 npM), e.g. for \u03c6 meson production [3]. Experiments showed, furthermore,\na surprisingly large ratio \u03c3(pd \u2192 pd\u03b7)/\u03c3(pp \u2192 pp\u03b7) [1,4]. Therefore, it is desirable to test\ndirectly predictions for the pn reactions.\nThe spectator technique [5,6] offers one possibility to isolate to a large extent the quasifree reaction at a neutron when a proton beam impinges on a deuteron target. Since the\nfinal state interactions in the pn system differs for singlet and triplet states and can be large\n1\n\n\fat threshold, it is of great advantage to consider the particular reaction pn \u2192 dM, as the\ndeuteron d is in one well defined state. Guided by this, in [7,8] the reactions pn \u2192 dM with\nM = \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032, \u03c9, \u03c6, a+\n0 have been considered.\nThe aim of the present note is to analyze the complete reaction pd \u2192 dMpsp and to\ntest to what extent the spectator technique [5,6] really selects a quasi-free reaction at the\nneutron in the deuteron target. In other words, we are going to derive a factorization\ntheorem showing kinematical conditions for which the total cross section \u03c3(pd \u2192 dMpsp )\nfactorizes in a part depending on the target deuteron characteristics and a part \u03c3(pn \u2192 dM).\nIn doing so we select as a sufficiently transparent example the \u03c6 production. The reasons\nare obvious: (i) the elementary \u03c6 production amplitude is simple [3], (ii) the \u03c6 meson is\ninteresting with respect to OZI rule [9] and hidden strangeness in the nucleon [3,8,10,11],\nand (iii) the \u03c6 meson is important with respect to both the inclusive K \u2212 production [12]\nand the e+ e\u2212 decay channel to be studied at HADES in near future [13]. An extension to\n\u03c1 and \u03c9 production goes along the same lines, but due to the role of s, u channel baryon\nresonances [10,14,15] the elementary amplitude of the subprocess pn \u2192 pnM is by far more\ncomplicate and needs separate consideration, as other mesons too.\nOur paper is organized as follows. In section II we present the kinematics, cross section\nand amplitudes of the complete reaction pd \u2192 d\u03c6psp . Numerical results are exhibited in\nsection III, where polarization observables are discussed and compared with the ones of the\nquasi-free sub-reaction pn \u2192 d\u03c6. We also derive selection rules. The factorization of the\ncross section is considered in section IV. The summary can be found in section V.\nII. KINEMATICS, CROSS SECTION, AMPLITUDES\n\nLet us consider the process of \u03c6 meson production in the exclusive reaction envisaged in\n[6]\npp + pd = p\u2032d + p\u03c6 + p\u2032p ,\n\n(1)\n\nat kinetic energies of the incoming proton corresponding to those achievable at the Cooler\nSynchotron COSY Tp \u2264 2.7 GeV. The deuteron is here supposed to be detected in the\nforward direction, i.e., in direction of the incoming proton with relativistic energy, Td\u2032 \u223c 1\nGeV, and, contrarily, the final (spectator) proton is slowly moving in the backward direction\n(\u03b8sp > 900 , p\u2032p < 100 MeV). The main contribution to the process (1) comes then from the\nspectator mechanism, where the incoming proton interacts with the internal neutron from\nthe deuteron and produces a meson and a deuteron in the final state. The second proton in\nthe deuteron acts merely as a spectator. Schematically the spectator mechanism is depicted\nin Fig. 1.\nIn the laboratory system, where the target deuteron is at rest, the relevant momenta are\ndefined by pp = (Ep , pp ) and pd = (Md , 0) as initial momenta of the proton and deuteron,\np\u2032p = (Ep\u2032 , p\u2032p ), p\u2032d = (Ed\u2032 , p\u2032d ), and p\u03c6 = (E\u03c6 , p\u03c6 ) as momenta of final proton, deuteron and \u03c6\nmeson, respectively. The fivefold differential cross section reads\n2Ed\u2032\n\nd5 \u03c3\n1\n\u221a\n=\n\u2032\n3\n\u2032\nd pd d\u03a9p\n8 (2\u03c0)5 \u03bb\n\n\"\n\n#\n\n|p\u2032p |2\n1 X\n|F |2 ,\n\u2032\n\u2032\n|B|pp | \u2212 CEp | 6 spins\n2\n\n(2)\n\n\fwhere the K\u00e4llen function \u03bb = 4 Md2 |pp |2 and the kinematical coefficients B = Md + Ep \u2212 Ed\u2032\n\u2032\nand C = |pp | cos \u03b8p\u2032 \u2212 |p\u2032d | cos \u03b8dp\nreflect the energy conservation. The invariant amplitude\nF depends, besides the spin projections sp , Md; s\u2032p , M\u2032d, M\u03c6 on the quantization z-axis (oriented along pp ), also upon the initial energy and five independent kinematical variables, say\np\u2032d and \u03a9\u2032p .\nTo compute the amplitude F , let us define the scattering operator \u00d4M\u03c6 ,M\u2032d (a 4\u22974 matrix\nin the spinor space) as the truncated amplitude for the subprocess pn \u2192 d\u03c6 (hatched blob\nof the diagram in Fig. 1), i.e., as an operator which, when sandwiched between two free\nspinors up and un , results in the amplitude of the real process pn \u2192 d\u03c6 with two on-mass\nshell nucleons. In the general case this operator is assumed to describe the process of meson\nproduction from two off-mass shell nucleons. With this definition, the amplitude F may be\nwritten as\n\u2032\n\u03b4c\nF = \u016b\u03b1 (p\u2032p , s\u2032p ) (p\u0302\u2032p \u2212 m)\u03b1\u03b2 \u03a6c\u03b2\nMd (pn , pp ) \u00d4M\u03c6 ,M\u2032 u\u03b4 (pp , sp ),\nd\n\n(3)\n\n\u2032\nwhere m is the nucleon mass and \u03a6c\u03b2\nMd (pn , pp ) denotes the Bethe-Salpeter (BS) amplitude of\nthe deuteron in the momentum space. In Eq. (3), the spinor indices are exhibited explicitly,\nwith Latin and Greek characters referring to neutrons and protons, respectively (summation\nover indices occurring pairwise is supposed). An expression for the amplitude (3) can be\nfound by specifying a model for the operator \u00d4. However, in order to keep the correspondence between the reaction (1) and the process of \u03c6 meson production in NN collisions as\nclose as possible, we highlight explicitly its dependence upon the BS amplitude of the final\ndeuteron by introducing another operator \u00d4 as\n\u03b4c\n\u00d4M\n\u2032\n\u03c6 ,Md\n\n= \u2212i\n\nZ\n\nd4 p \u03b1b \u2032 \u2032 bc\n\u03a6\u0304 \u2032 (1 , 2 ) \u00d4\u03b1\u03b4 (12; 1\u2032 2\u2032 , M\u03c6 ).\n(2\u03c0)4 Md\n\n(4)\n\nThen from Eq. (4) and from Fig. 1 it is easy to recognize the operator \u00d4(12; 1\u20322\u2032 , M\u03c6 ) as the\none describing the \u03c6 meson production in the sub-reaction pn \u2192 d\u03c6 with an off-mass shell\ninitial neutron. Such an operator has been introduced in Ref. [16] where its properties have\nbeen discussed in detail. We briefly recall here the main steps in computing \u00d4(12; 1\u20322\u2032 , M\u03c6 )\nand the amplitude F in Eq. (3). Usually, within the BS formalism in order to exhibit\nformulae in a familiar matrix form, one introduces new, \"charge-conjugated\" quantities\nsuch as \u03a8 \u2261 \u2212\u03a6\u03b3c , Q\u0302 \u2261 \u03b3c \u00d4, \u03b3c \u03b3\u03bcT = \u2212\u03b3\u03bc \u03b3c , v(p) = [\u016b(p)\u03b3c ]T , v\u0304(p) = [\u03b3c u(p)]T .

(5) and in subsequent expressions one has usual matrix multiplications and\ntraces.

Here is worth emphasizing that the kinematics of the process (1) differs from\nthe one of the real process pn \u2192 d\u03c6. In spite of commonly defined variable t, the numerical\nvalues of momenta of the final meson and deuteron do not coincide in the two processes.\nM ,M\u2032\nRather, the amplitude Tsp ,s\u03c6n d (\u03bdpn , t) in the process (1) corresponds to an amplitude of\nmeson production from an off-mass shell neutron. If the off-mass shell effects were negligiM ,M\u2032\nbly small, then Tsp ,s\u03c6n d (\u03bdpn , t) in both processes would depend solely upon the momentum\ntransfer t and the effective energy \u03bdN N = (Ep + Ep\u2032 )2 \u2212 (p \u2212 p\u2032 )2 .

We use the parameter set \"B\" in Ref. [11] to calculate the amplitudes\nM\nAsp ,s\u03c6n ;r,r\u2032 (12; 1\u20322\u2032 ). Now the second part of the matrix element in Eq.

Equation (8) shows that an exact factorization of the cross section into\ntwo parts (one depending upon the target deuteron wave function, another one upon the\nkinematics and dynamics of the subprocess pn \u2192 d\u03c6) generally does not occur. This is\nbecause the summation over the spins of the internal neutron sn which leads to interference\nterms in the square of the matrix element. However, below we show that under special\nkinematical conditions an approximate factorization is possible.\nIII. NUMERICAL RESULTS\n\nFrom Eqs. (6 - 8), the differential cross section (2) and any other polarization observables\nof the process pd \u2192 d\u03c6psp are calculable. The BS wave functions uS,D basically coincide\nwith the non-relativistic S and D waves of the deuteron for small values of the momentum\nof the spectator proton (see [17]). Therefore, the relativistic and non-relativistic expressions\nfor the amplitude F have the same form, and one may perform also calculations by using\n4\n\n\fdeuteron wave functions obtained within a non-relativistic approach. In our calculations we\nuse the BS solution [18], obtained with a realistic one-boson exchange kernel. Additionally,\nParis and Bonn wave functions are considered to investigate the sensitivity of observables\non the deuteron model.\nAll our calculations have been performed within kinematical conditions corresponding\nto the COSY Proposal #75 [6], i.e., the detected deuteron is supposed to be in the forward\ndirection and the spectator proton in the backward hemisphere with \u03b8p\u2032 \u223c 1200 \u2212 1400. The\nmomenta of the deuteron are chosen in the range p\u2032d \u223c 1.9 - 3 GeV/c, which means that the\nspectator proton is detected with low velocity, i.e., p\u2032p \u223c 0 - 0.04 GeV/c. These kinematic\nconditions imply that both the reaction (1) and the subprocess pn \u2192 d\u03c6 occur essentially\nnear the threshold.\nIn Fig. 2, the differential cross section is presented as a function of the deuteron momentum for the specific choice of variables \u03b8d\u2032 = 00 , and \u03b8p\u2032 = 130o . (We changed the kinematics\nwith \u03b8d\u2032 up to 5o and find a very smooth behavior of all observable.) The kinetic energy of\nthe initial proton is Tp = 2.69 GeV. The maximum of the cross section at p\u2032d \u223c 2.35 GeV/c\ncorresponds to that kinematical condition where the momentum of the spectator proton is\nmaximal, p\u2032p \u223c 0.035 GeV/c. Together with the large spectator angles this implies that\nat these kinematical conditions the excess energy in the pn \u2192 d\u03c6 subprocess is minimal\n(\u2206s1/2 \u223c 4 MeV) and very near the threshold. Obviously, since at such kinematics the production amplitude is almost constant, the maximum in the differential cross section has a\npure kinematical origin being entirely governed by the kinematical factor within the square\nbrackets in Eq. (2). Fig. 2 highlights that different models for the deuteron wave function\nresult in quantitatively different cross sections. This is because the integration over the\ninternal momentum in the final deuteron covers the region of the minimum of the S wave\nwhere different models provide essentially different wave functions (see discussion in [16]).\nLet us now discuss polarization observables. Since the spin structure of the amplitude F\nM ,M\u2032\nin Eq. (8) is basically determined by the spin structure of the amplitude Tsp ,s\u03c6n d (\u03bdpn , t) of the\nsubprocess pn \u2192 d\u03c6, we proceed with an analysis of this amplitude. Bearing in mind that\nM ,M\u2032\nTsp ,s\u03c6n d (\u03bdpn , t) is a Lorentz invariant quantity one can, for the sake of simplicity, investigate\nits structure in the center of mass of the detected deuteron (near the threshold this system\ncoincides with the center of mass system of two nucleons), provided the Lorentz boost is\nM ,M\u2032\nperformed along the z-axis. In such a case the spin structure of Tsp ,s\u03c6n d (\u03bdpn , t) is the same as\nin the laboratory system (no additional Wigner rotations are needed). Near the threshold,\nthe final \u03c6 \u2212 d system is in a S orbital state corresponding to If = 0, JD\u03c0 = 1+ (LD = 0, 2),\nJf\u03c0 = J\u03c6\u03c0 + JD\u03c0 = 0\u2212 , 1\u2212 , 2\u2212 , where I, L and J \u03c0 are the total isospin, total radial angular\nmomentum, angular momentum and parity, respectively. Thus from symmetry constraints\nthe allowed configurations in the initial state are Ii = 0, Li = 1, 3, 5 * * * and total spin Si = 0.\nThe conservation law Ji = Jf implies Li = 1, so that Ji\u03c0 = 1\u2212 . Hence, near the threshold the\nM ,M\u2032\nmain contribution into the amplitude Tsp ,s\u03c6n d (\u03bdpn , t) comes from initial spin configurations\nwith sp = \u2212sn and, since the two nucleons in the final state form a deuteron (with the total\nspin S = 1), the most probable transitions near the threshold are expected to be those with\nnucleon spin-flips in the corresponding vertices and with the deuteron projections M\u2032d = \u00b11.\nConsequently, the projections of the \u03c6 meson are to be M\u03c6 = \u22131.\nComing back to the complete reaction one can expect that the prevailing contribution\n5\n\n\finto the full amplitude F comes from configurations with Md \u2212 s\u2032p = \u2212sp , if (i) the effects\nof D waves in the target deuteron may be disregarded near the threshold, (ii) the spectator\nmechanism describes the reaction appropriately, and (iii) the factorization (see below) holds.\nHence, near the threshold the polarization observables of the reaction (1) are predicted to\nbehave in the same manner as the ones of the subprocess pn \u2192 d\u03c6. Therefore, the study of\nvarious polarization observables allows to check the factorization.\nLet us define the asymmetry of the reaction as\nA=\n\nd\u03c3(sp + sn = 1) + d\u03c3(sp + sn = \u22121) \u2212 d\u03c3(sp + sn = 0)\n,\nd\u03c3(sp + sn = 1) + d\u03c3(sp + sn = \u22121) + d\u03c3(sp + sn = 0)\n\n(9)\n\nwhere the spin of the intrinsic neutron is defined as sn = Md \u2212 s\u2032p . Then, from the above\nselection rules near the threshold, the asymmetry A is predicted to be negative and close\nto -1. In Fig. 3, results of a complete calculation of the asymmetry A are presented. The\nkinematical conditions are as in Fig. 2. It is seen that in the whole kinematical range of p\u2032d\nthe asymmetry is basically the same as in the subprocess pn \u2192 d\u03c6. Moreover, as expected,\nat p\u2032d near the maximum the asymmetry approaches -1.\nSimilar results are obtained for other polarization observables. For instance, the tensor\nanalyzing power defined as\n1 d\u03c3(M\u2032d = 1) + d\u03c3(M\u2032d = \u22121) \u2212 2d\u03c3(M\u2032d = 0)\n,\n(10)\nT20 = \u221a\n2 d\u03c3(M\u2032d = 1) + d\u03c3(M\u2032d = \u22121) + d\u03c3(M\u2032d = 0)\n\u221a\nis predicted to be 1/ 2 from the selection rules. Indeed, the full evaluation of Eqs. (6 -8)\nyields a value close to that (see Fig. 4).\nApart from the polarization observables which near the threshold are determined directly\nby the corresponding quantities for the subprocess pn \u2192 d\u03c6, one can define another set of\nobservables with completely different behavior in the two reactions, i.e., in the subprocess\npn \u2192 d\u03c6 and in the reaction (1). For this purpose let us define observables at fixed initial\ndeuteron and proton spin projections, e.g., at Md = 0 and sp = 21 , respectively. Near\nthe threshold this means that the spin projection of the neutron will be sn = \u2212s\u2032p and by\nmeasuring the spectator polarization one can form different combinations which determine\n(allowed or forbidden) transitions for the subprocess pn \u2192 d\u03c6. Together with conservation\nrules for the complete reaction this admits a study of different observables which vanish in\nthe sub-reaction pn \u2192 d\u03c6. Correspondingly, let us define the quantity\nWzz =\n\nd\u03c3(M\u03c6 = 1) \u2212 d\u03c3(M\u03c6 = \u22121)\nd\u03c3(M\u03c6 = 1) + d\u03c3(M\u03c6 = \u22121)\n\n.\n\n(11)\n\nsp = 21 ;Md =0\n\nIf one measures this quantity for the positive spin projection of the spectator, then in the\nsubprocess pn \u2192 d\u03c6 one has super allowed transitions (sp + sn = 0, M\u03c6 = \u00b11, M\u2032d =\n\u22131) and, since in (11) a summation over the final deuteron projections is assumed, Wzz is\npredicted to approach zero at the threshold (see [16]).\nA different situation occurs if one considers Wzz at s\u2032p = \u22121/2. In this case, at least\nfor t = tmin(max) (i.e., the forward/backward direction for the subprocess pn \u2192 d\u03c6), the\nconservation of the spin projection in the complete reaction (1) strongly suppresses the final\n6\n\n\fstates with M\u03c6 = M\u2032d = \u00b11 and M\u03c6 = \u22121, M\u2032d = 0, so that the only contributing final\nstates remain these with M\u03c6 = 1, M\u2032d = 0, \u22121 and M\u03c6 = \u22121, M\u2032d = 1, which imply\nWzz \u223c 1/3, in contrast to the vanishing Wzz in pn \u2192 d\u03c6 [16]. Figure 5 illustrates our full\nnumerical evaluation for Wzz at s\u2032p = \u22121/2.\nIV. FACTORIZATION\n\nLet us discuss in more detail the behavior of the cross section Eq. (2) with the matrix\nelement (8) near the threshold. As mentioned above, the summation over the spin projection of the intrinsic neutron sn in Eq. (8) prevents an exact factorization of the cross\nsection into the cross section of the subprocess pn \u2192 d\u03c6 and a \"target factor\". However,\nfrom Figs. 3 - 5 we conclude that, since the deviations of the exactly calculated observables\nfrom those determined by the selection rules of the subprocess pn \u2192 d\u03c6 are small, a factorization should hold indeed with a good accuracy. For instance, the asymmetry in Fig. 3\nM ,M\u2032\ndemonstrates the validity of the selection rule sp = \u2212sn , i.e., the amplitude Tsp ,s\u03c6n d (\u03bdpn , t)\nis proportional to \u03b4sp ,\u2212sn . Similarly, Fig. 5 shows that the main contribution comes from\nM ,M\u2032\n\ntransitions with |M\u2032d | = 1, and from the above selection rules the amplitude Tsp ,s\u03c6n d (\u03bdpn , t)\nis also proportional to \u03b4M\u2032d ,\u2212M\u03c6 . Hence, near the threshold one may represent the amplitude\nM ,M\u2032\n\nas Tsp ,s\u03c6n d (\u03bdpn , t) = \u03b4M\u2032d ,\u2212M\u03c6 \u03b4sp ,\u2212sn Tesp ,M\u2032d (\u03bdpn , t), where Tesp ,M\u2032d (\u03bdpn , t) is the threshold-near\namplitude of the process pn \u2192 d\u03c6. Then in Eq. (8) the summation over sn disappears and,\nas conjectured above, the unpolarized cross section Eq. (2) factorizes. Substituting this amplitude into Eq. (2), introducing the corresponding flux factors for the sub-reaction pn \u2192 d\u03c6\nand performing the summation over all spin projections, the unpolarized cross section can\nbe cast in the form\n\u0011 d\u03c3(pn \u2192 d\u03c6)\n2 \u03bdpn (\u03bdpn \u2212 4m2 ) |p\u2032p |2 \u0010 2 \u2032\nd5 \u03c3\n2\n\u2032\n\u2032\n=\nu\n(|p\n|)\n+\nu\n(|p\n|)\n,\n(12)\n2Ed 3 \u2032\nS\np\nD\np\nd pd d\u03a9\u2032p\n(2\u03c0)3 |p| |B|p\u2032p | \u2212 CEp\u2032 |\ndt\nwhere the differential cross section d\u03c3(pn \u2192 d\u03c6)/dt depends only upon the transferred\nmomentum t (determined by pp and p\u2032d ) and the invariant mass \u03bdpn (determined by pp and\np\u2032p due to the balance En = Md \u2212 Ep\u2032 , pn = \u2212p\u2032p ). From Eq. (12) it is seen that by studying\nexperimentally the amplitude (8), near the threshold, one can obtain directly information\nabout the subprocess pn \u2192 d\u03c6. Here it is worth reminding that the factorization of the\ncross section holds only if the contribution of the D wave is negligible, i.e., if in Eq. (8) one\ncan put sn = \u2212sp and arrives at\nF\u2248\n\nq\n\nM\u03c6 ,M\u2032d\n8\u03c0Md Tsp ,\u2212s\n(\u03bdpn , t)\np\n\n\"\n\nd\nuS (|p\u2032p |) C 1M\n1 \u2032 1\ns \u2212sp\n2 p2\n\n\u221a\n\n\u2212 uD (|p\u2032p |) 4\u03c0\n\nX\nm\u03bc\n\n1Md\nC2m1\u03bc\nC 1\u03bc\n1 \u2032 1\ns\n\u2212s\np\np\n2\n2\n\n#\n\nY2m (n) . (13)\n\nEqs. (8, 12) and (13) show that the smaller the values of the spectator momentum are\nthe higher the accuracy of the factorization is. This has been confirmed numerically by\ncomparing exact results based on Eqs. (2, 8) and approximate results based on Eqs. (12,\n13). In the whole kinematical region of interests the difference is less than 0.5%.\nOne may generally conjecture that a structure analog to Eq. (8) gives rise to factorization\nunder suitable kinematical conditions, hence providing a theoretical foundation of quasi-free\nreactions at the neutron in the deuteron.\n7\n\n\fV. SUMMARY\n\nIn summary, within a covariant Bethe-Salpeter approach we study the relation of the\ntagged quasi-free reaction pn \u2192 d\u03c6 and the complete process pd \u2192 d\u03c6psp near the threshold.\nGuided by the very proximity of the numerical results for cross section and polarization\nobservables based on the exact formulae and on the factorized ones, we find that, for special\nkinematical conditions, selection rules are operative immediately causing a factorization\n\u03c3(pd \u2192 d\u03c6psp ) = F \u03c3(pn \u2192 d\u03c6) where F depends on deuteron and kinematical quantities.\nThis is equivalent to an omission of the contribution of the deuteron D wave at small values\nof the spectator momentum.\nAs an extension of the present work, an investigation of the twice tagged reaction dd \u2192\nnnMpsp1 psp2 can be envisaged to study the quasi-free meson production by the nn reaction\nproposed in [19].\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe are grateful to A.I.
