These\ncompounds being composed of triangular sheets of cobalt\natoms, they share in common with the high-temperature\nsuperconductor cuprates the fascinating physics combining the strong correlations and the geometrical\nfrustration in two dimension7 .\nAlso, most of the cobaltates display at room temperature a metallic resistivity and a large thermopower allowing for thermoelectric applications. While it is known\nthat either the entropy of localized spins8,9 or the electronic correlations10 can increase thermopower, it has\nbeen suggested despite their antagonism that both of\nthem seem to contribute in cobaltates11 . The latter interpretation being still highly debated, the interplay between magnetism and transport properties appears as\na very challenging issue to understand the underlying\nphysics in the cobaltates12 .\nIn addition, various misfit cobaltates exhibit complex\ntransport properties as metal-insulator crossover and\nlarge negative magnetoresistance9,13,15 which raise the\nquestion of the nature of the elementary excitations. In\nthis context, we report in this article on an experimental\nstudy of the single crystal magnetoresistance and magnetization in the misfit cobaltate Ca3 Co4 O9 in order to\nconnect both of them and to discuss its metallicity.\nThe studied single crystals were grown using a standard flux method14 , with typical sizes of the order of\n4\u00d72\u00d70.02 mm3 . Similarly to Nax CoO2 4 , the structure of\n\nthe incommensurate cobaltate [CoCa2 O3 ]RS\n0.62 CoO2 (abbreviated thereafter CaCoO) contains single [CoO2 ] layer\nof CdI2 type stacked with rocksalt-type layers labeled RS\ninstead of a sodium deficient layer. One of the in-plane\nsublattice parameters being different from one layer to\nthe other13 , the cobaltate CaCoO has a misfit structure\nas in most related compounds9 .\n\nII.\n\nMEASUREMENTS\n\nAs frequently observed in misfit cobaltates9,13,15 , the\ntemperature dependence of resistivity displayed in Fig. 1\nexhibits a transport crossover from a high temperature\nmetalliclike regime to a low temperature insulatinglike\nbehavior below nearly 70 K.\n1.0\n\n\u03bc0H = 0 T\n\n10\n\n(\u03c1(\u03b8)\u2212\u03c1(0))/(\u03c1(\u03c0/2)\u2212\u03c1(0))\n\nI.\n\n\u03c1 (m\u03a9 cm)\n\narXiv:0811.0506v1 [cond-mat.str-el] 4 Nov 2008\n\nLaboratoire LEMA, UMR 6157 CNRS-CEA, Universit\u00e9 F.

In order to be abble to compare these results with the magnetoresistance, the data set reported\nin Fig. 3 has been measured by applying an in-plane magnetic field.\n7\n2K\n6\n\n10 K\n\n5\n-1\n\nM (emu g )\n\nworth noting. First, the values of the resistivity remain\nof the order of the Mott limit16 over the whole temperature range, i.e. nearly 3 m\u03a9 cm in this compound. This\nmeans that the electronic mean free path is of the order of the magnitude of the interatomic spacing as in\na bad metal in the vicinity of a Mott metal-insulator\ntransition3,17 for example. Also, by showing a large negative magnetoresistance, the low temperature insulatinglike behavior in Fig. 1 tends to be suppressed by the\napplication of a magnetic field. As a consequence of the\ntwo previous characteristics, the latter regime does not\nseem to result from a gap opening in the one-particle\nelectronic spectrum as it has early been proposed18 . As\na matter of fact, such a scenario would require a gap much\nmore smaller than the crossover temperature, which invalidates an activated conduction and leads to unrealistic Coulomb interaction energy19 . Then, in order to\ninvestigate this particular low temperature regime, we\nhave performed both magnetoresistance and magnetization measurements in CaCoO.\n\n20 K\n\n4\n\n30 K\n40 K\n50 K\n60 K\n\n3\n2\n1\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n\u03bc0H (T)\n\nA.\n\nMagnetoresistance\n\nFirst, we have measured the single crystal in-plane resistivity \u03c1(H,T) using a standard four terminal method\nat constant temperature T as a function of an in-plane\nmagnetic field \u03bc0 H, for which the negative magnetoresistance displayed in the inset of Fig. 1 is the largest.\n\n\u03c1(T,H)/\u03c1(T,H=0)\n\n1.000\n60 K\n50 K\n\n0.995\n\nFIG. 3: Magnetic field dependence of the single crystal inplane magnetization up to 9 T over the whole temperature\nrange, the magnetic field being parallel to the CoO2 planes.\n\nAs it is suggested in Fig. 3 by the sizeable increase\nof the first magnetization below nearly 20 K a magnetic ordering, already interpreted as a ferrimagnetic\ntransition18 , occurs within this temperature range.

In this temperature range, Fig. 4\ndemonstrates that the magnetoresistance fully scales\nwith the magnetization according an activated form\nwhich can be written following Eq. 1.\n\u0012\n\u0013\nM\u03bc\n\u03c1(T, H) = \u03c1(T, H = 0) exp \u2212\u03b1\nT\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is a constant and the exponent \u03bc equals approximately 2 as expected in the spin dependent transport mechanism proposed by Wagner et al.20,21 to explain\nthe colossal magnetoresistance measured in the manganites.\nThis spin dependent transport mechanism is in fact an\nextension of a variable range hopping16,22 to the case of\n\n\f3\n\nT ln(\u03c1(T,H=0)/\u03c1(T,H)) (K)\n\nmagnetic disorder20,21 . The main ideas which underlie\nthis conducting process consist in a variable range spin\ndependent hopping due to the Hund's coupling -JH s.\u03c3\nbetween the quasiparticles spin s and the localized spin\n\u03c3, with the Hund's coupling constant JH . To basically\nillustrate this mechanism, let us consider the propagation\nof a quasiparticle with a spin si from the site i to the site\nj as sketched in Fig. 5 with the involved spin polarized\nelectronic energy levels.\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n2K\n3K\n4K\n5K\n6K\n8K\n10 K\n\n-2\n\n\u2206ij\n\u03b8ij\n\ni\n\nj\n\nFIG. 5: (color online). Schematic picture of the electronic energy levels involved in an elementary spin dependent hopping\nfrom the site i to the site j. The magnetic potential barrier\n\u2206ij results from the misorientation \u03b8ij between the quasiparticle spin si (thin red arrow) and the localized spin \u03c3j (bold\nblack arrow) as explained in the text.\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n-1\n\nM (emu g )\n\nFIG. 4: (color online). Scaling plot of the single crystal inplane magnetoresistance as a function of the magnetization\nat low temperatures.\n\nBecause si points along the localized spin \u03c3i direction,\nthe misorientation \u03b8ij between \u03c3i and the neighbor localized spin \u03c3j leads to a magnetic potentiel barrier \u2206ij =\u2206\n(1-cos \u03b8ij )/2 with \u2206=2JH s\u03c3. These magnetic potential\nbarriers being distributed over the sample, they favor a\nhopping conduction of either activated or VRH type depending on the barriers distribution. Indeed, one might\nexpect an activited conduction if magnetic correlations\nexist from one site to another (case of a weak magnetic\ndisorder), or a VRH conduction if the paramagnetism\npersists down to the low temperatures (case of a strong\nmagnetic disorder). Therefore, the reported activated\nbehavior in Fig. 4 seems consistent with the presence of\nmagnetic correlations in this temperature range in agreement with the magnetization data displayed in Fig. 3.\nMoreover, the previously mentioned misorientation\n~ i,j at\ncan be expressed from the local magnetizations M\n2\n~i * M\n~ j =M cos \u03b8ij , with the\nthe two sites i and j as M\nS\nsaturation magnetization MS . It follows that the local\nmagnetic potentiel barrier is a function of local magnetizations. Then, an applied magnetic field which tends to\nalign the localized spins, lowers the magnetic potentiel\nbarrier and thus implies a negative magnetoresistance as\nobserved in Fig. 1 and 2.\nLet us for now discuss the magnetization exponent infered from the scaling plot in Fig. 4. In the spin dependent transport mechanism proposed by Wagner et al.20 ,\nthe local magnetizations Mi,j are the sum of two differ-\n\nent contributions: the Weiss magnetization MW , which\nis common to both sites i and j, and the local corrections\n\u03b4Mi,j . The magnetic field dependent part of the average\npotentiel barrier h\u2206ij i varying as hcos \u03b8ij i, it can then be\n~i*M\n~ j i and its following expanrelated to the product hM\nsion:\n~i * M\n~ j i = (MW )2 + 2MW h\u03b4Mi i + h\u03b4Mi \u03b4Mj i\nhM\n\n(2)\n\nThree limiting cases can thus occur, involving one of the\nthree terms in the previous relation.\ni) In a paramagnet where MW =0, the first two terms\n~i*M\n~ j i is expected to scale as the\nin Eq. 2 vanish and hM\nthird one, h\u03b4Mi \u03b4Mj i=h\u03b4Mi i2 , namely the square of the\nparamagnetic magnetization.\nIn the opposite limit, in a ferromagnetic state with\n~i *M\n~ j i may be dominated by the first\nMW \u226b h\u03b4Mi i, hM\ntwo terms.\nii) Therefore, if the Weiss magnetization is constant,\ni.e. both magnetic field and temperature independent\n~i * M\n~ j i should vary\n(in a high magnetic field regime), hM\nas the second term, namely h\u03b4Mi i.\niii) In a low magnetic field regime or in a soft ferromagnet, if MW is both magnetic field and temperature\n~i *M\n~ j i should\ndependent but still higher than h\u03b4Mi i, hM\nthen scale as the first term, namely M2W .\nIn particular, cases i) and iii) explain why the exponent\n\u03bc=2 is expected in the low magnetization regime, either\ncorrelated or not.\n\nB.\n\nHigh temperature regime\n\nFurthermore, in order to extend the scaling analysis to\nhigher temperatures, namely above 10 K, let us consider\n\n\f4\nthat the resistivity results from two conduction mechanisms. The spin dependent one, \u03c1sp , gives rise to the\nobserved large negative magnetoresistance whereas the\nother, \u03c1QP , is assumed to be weakly magnefic field dependent. Here, the initials QP stand for quasiparticles.\nAccording to the Matthiessen rule, the experimental resistivity \u03c1(T, H) can then be written following Eq. 3.\n\nhigh temperature regime. As a result, the transport\ncrossover around 70 K appears more as the temperature\nbelow which a diffusion mechanism predominates over\nthe other rather than a consequence of a qualitative\nevolution of the system.\n\n2.5\n\n\u03c1(T, H) \u2248 \u03c1sp (T, H) + \u03c1QP (T )\n\nexperiment\n\u03c1sp+\u03c1QP\n\n(3)\n\n\u03c1sp\n\n10\n\n1\n\n\u03c1 (m\u03a9 cm)\n\n2.0\n\nAs a matter of fact, if we directly perform the same\nscaling as in Fig. 4 the data are systematically shifted\ndownward suggesting an incorrect normalization at zero\nmagnetic field and thus, an additional contribution to the\nresistivity weakly magnefic field dependent.\n\n\u03c1QP\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n3\n\n0\n\n2\n\n0.0\n\n\u03bc\n\nT ln(\u03c1sp(T,H=0)/\u03c1sp(T,H)) (K)\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2K\n3K\n4K\n5K\n6K\n8K\n10 K\n20 K\n30 K\n40 K\n50 K\n60 K\n\n-1\n\n0\n-1\n10\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n-1\n\nM (emu g )\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\nT (K)\n\nFIG. 7: (color online).

Scaling plot of the effective single\ncrystal in-plane magnetoresistance \u03c1sp (T,H) as a function of\nthe magnetization over the whole temperature range. Here,\n\u03c1sp (T,H) has been calculated by substrating to the experimental value a constant resistivity at each temperature above\n10 K. To make sense, the substracted part is assumed to be\nweakly magnetic field dependent. The inset displays the variation of the exponent \u03bc with the magnetization.\n\nTherefore, the previous scaling can be extended in\nFig. 6 over the whole temperature range by substracting the contribution \u03c1QP to the experimental resistivity\nup to 60 K, \u03c1QP being considered as a free parameter.\nAlso, the inset of the Fig. 6 displays that the exponent\n\u03bc equals 2 in the low magnetization regime, either correlated (case iii)) or not (case i)), and seems to slightly\ndecrease above M\u2248 1 emu g\u22121 as suggested in the case\nii).\nInterestingly, the T-dependence of the contribution\n\u03c1QP reveals in Fig. 7 a continuous metalliclike behavior down to the low temperatures. Since the metallic\npart of the magnetoresistance is usually very weak, the\nfound component agrees with the initial assumption of an\nadditional contribution weakly magnetic field dependent.\nBesides, both the T-dependence and the order of\nmagnitude of \u03c1QP are consistent with the metalliclike\n\nIn other words, the electronic transport seems to originate from metallic or quasi-metallic conduction over the\nwhole temperature range but shadowed at low temperatures by an efficient spin dependent diffusion mechanism.\nFurther both experimental and theoretical investigations\nare now needed in order to understand the influences of\nthe misfit structure as well as the frustration induced by\nthe triangular lattice on this shadow metallicity and its\nconnection with the thermopower.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nTo conclude, we have investigated the low temperature\nmagnetic field dependence of both the resistivity and the\nmagnetization in the misfit cobaltate CaCoO from 60 K\ndown to 2 K. The measured negative magnetoresistance\nreveals a scaling behavior with the magnetization which\ndemonstrates a spin dependent diffusion mechanism in\naddition to a shadowed metalliclike conduction over the\nwhole temperature range. This result provides a natural\nexplanation of the observed transport crossover and shed\na new light on the nature of the elementary excitations\nrelevant to the transport.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nIt is a pleasure to acknowledge useful discussions with\nS.
