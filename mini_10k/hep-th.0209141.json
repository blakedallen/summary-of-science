The usual set-up consists of several branes intersecting so that their common\nworldvolume has some Poincare invariance and preserves some supersymmetry. From the microscopic\nD-brane perspective the low energy dynamics is governed by open string theory and hence coincides\nwith Yang-Mills theory to lowest order in derivatives. In the macroscopic description branes are\nminimal volume surfaces their dynamics is essentially determined by geometry. To be more precise the\ninduced metric on the brane defines a metric on the moduli space of deformations of the surface and\nthe low energy effective action is then given by the associated \u03c3-model.\nRecently, in connection with compactifications of M-theory on exceptional manifolds, brane intersections with minimal supersymmetry have been studied and related to gauge theory [1, 2, 3].\nSupersymmetry imposes the additional condition that the brane worldvolume is not just minimal but\ncalibrated [4]. In [5] Bogomoln'yi equations were derived for various intersections where static gauge\nwas imposed with respect to one of the branes. The resulting equations are known as Harvey-Lawson\nequations [6] and are also known to be local conditions for the embedded surface to be calibrated. Here\nwe wish to revisit some of this analysis but treat all the branes on an equal footing. In particular we\nwill not impose static gauge for any one particular brane. A benefit of this analysis is that near the\nintersection of two branes the scalar fields behave smoothly (although they will now diverge linearly\nat infinity).\nThis paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we discuss some general features of supersymmetric\nembeddings of D-branes into spacetime. In particular we obtain a general form for the metric on the\nmoduli space of deformations which yields a simple condition for the normalisability of the moduli. In\nsection 3 we specialise to the case of three-dimensional intersections. Our discussion will be in terms of\nD3-branes but can readily be applied to other cases, most notably D6-branes. In particular we discuss\nsolutions with preserve eight and four supercharges and correspond to Riemann surfaces and special\nLagrangian surfaces respectively. We also include a discussion of the moduli spaces and the relation\nto flat directions of a non-Abelian superpotential. Finally in section 4 we consider the analogous case\nof intersecting D6-branes and their lift to new G2 manifolds in M-theory.\n\n2\n\nSupersymmetric Embeddings\n\nWe consider Dp-branes where the worldvolume gauge field vanishes and the background spacetime is\nflat. Most of our analysis can also be readily extended to cases where the background is of special\nholonomy, although concrete results will be considerably more difficult to obtain. The condition that\nthe brane is supersymmetric is \u0393\u01eb1 = \u01eb2 where \u01eb1 and \u01eb2 are the ten-dimensional supersymmetry\ngenerators. The projector \u0393 is [7]\n\u0393=\n\n1\n1\np\n\u01ebi0 ...ip \u2202i0 X m0 ...\u2202ip X mp \u0393m0 ...mp .\n(1 + p)! \u2212det(g)\n\n(2.1)\n\nHere \u0393m , m = 0, ..., 9 form the ten-dimensional Clifford algebra. The indices i, j... = 0, 1, ..., p label\nthe worldvolume coordinates \u03c3 i of the brane and gij = \u2202i X m \u2202j X n \u03b7mn is the induced metric on the\nbrane. In this paper we will assume that all branes are static and fix \u03c3 0 = X 0 . Thus what follows\ni, j = 1, ..., p.\n1\n\n\fThe important constraint of this system is that \u01eb1 and \u01eb2 are constant spinors. Thus finding a\nsupersymmetric brane configuration requires finding an embedding such that \u0393\u01eb1 is constant over the\nbrane. In particular, since \u03932 = \u00b11 and \u0393\u2020 = \u00b1\u0393, where the sign depends on p, we can follow [4] and\nobserve that\n\u01eb\u20202 \u01eb2 + \u01eb\u20201 \u01eb1 \u2213 \u01eb\u20201 \u0393\u01eb2 \u2212 \u01eb\u20202 \u0393\u01eb1 = (\u01eb2 \u2212 \u0393\u01eb1 )\u2020 (\u01eb2 \u2212 \u0393\u01eb1 ) \u2265 0 ,\n(2.2)\nwith equalitypiff the embedding is supersymmetric, i.e. \u01eb2 = \u0393\u01eb1 . If we normalize \u01eb\u20202 \u01eb2 = \u01eb\u20201 \u01eb1 = 1 and\nmultiply by \u2212det(g)d\u03c3 1 \u2227 ... \u2227 d\u03c3 p we find the inequality\np\n\u2212det(g)d\u03c3 1 \u2227 ... \u2227 d\u03c3 p \u2265 \u03c9m1 ...mp \u22021 X m1 ...\u2202p X mp d\u03c3 1 \u2227 ... \u2227 d\u03c3 p ,\n(2.3)\n\nwhere\n\n1\n(2.4)\n\u03c9m1 ...mp = \u01eb\u20202 \u03930m1 ...mp \u01eb1 + c.c .\n2\nThe inequality (2.3) states that the volume form on the brane's worldvolume, when evaluated on any\ntangent plane, is bounded below by the pull-back to the worldvolume of the closed spacetime p-form\n\u03c9. Note that the same argument applies to D\u0304p-branes where \u0393\u01eb1 = \u2212\u01eb2 but as a consequence the sign\nof \u03c9 is reversed in (2.3).\nThis is precisely the notion of a calibration i.e. a closed p-form \u03c9 in the bulk spacetime whose\nintegral over p-dimensional surfaces is bounded above by their volume. A surface which saturates the\nbound, i.e. a supersymmetric embedding, is said to be calibrated by \u03c9. It is straightforward to show\nthat any smooth calibrated surface is volume minimizing in its homology class. To see this we suppose\nthat a surface \u03a3 is calibrated and consider a perturbation to a new manifold \u03a3\u2032 :1 .\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\n\u03c9 \u2264 Vol(\u03a3\u2032 ) .\n(2.5)\n\u03c9=\n\u03c9+\n\u03c9=\nVol(\u03a3) =\n\u03a3\n\n\u2202B\n\n\u03a3\u2032\n\n\u03a3\u2032\n\nHere B is a compact manifold whose boundary is \u03a3 \u222a \u03a3\u2032 and we have used the fact that\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nd\u03c9 = 0 .\n\u03c9=\n\u03c9=\n\u03c9\u2212\n\u03a3\n\n\u03a3\u2032\n\n\u2202B\n\n(2.6)\n\nB\n\nThus a calibrated surface satisfies the equation of motion for a Dp-brane (in the absence of other\nworldvolume fields).\nGiven a smooth embedding of a brane into space it will generally depend on several moduli labeled\nby ua , a = 1, ..., n. It is natural to consider the low energy effective action of the brane, where its\nmoduli become time-dependent. More generally if the brane has an additional isometric direction,\nsuch as two D3-branes intersecting over a line, then one can also introduce dependence on these extra\nspatial dimensions. The result will then be an effective field theory which is a trivial extension of the\naction will now derive. In static gauge the induced metric is\ngij = \u2202i X m \u2202j X n \u03b7mn = \u03b7ij + \u2202i X I \u2202j X J \u03b4IJ ,\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere \u03c3 i = X i and I = p + 1, ..., 9 labels the transverse coordinates. The (potential) energy for a static\nDp-brane simply its spatial volume\nZ\np\n(2.8)\nE = dp \u03c3 \u2212det(g) .\n1\n\nSince \u03a3 will generically be non-compact we require that \u03a3\u2032 is different from \u03a3 only on a compact set \u03a3c and that all\nthe integrals are over \u03a3c\n\n2\n\n\fTo obtain an effective Lagrangian for the moduli ua we allow them to pick up a slow time dependence\nso that the induced metric (2.7) also has g00 and g0i components. The effective Lagrangian Lef f is\nthen just (minus) the potential energy functional E expanded to second order in time derivatives but\nto all orders in the spatial derivatives. If we use a dot to denote a time derivative then we find that\nexpanding (2.8) to second order gives\nLef f = \u03b3ab u\u0307a u\u0307b ,\n(2.9)\nwhere\n\u03b3ab =\n\nZ\n\np\n\nd \u03c3\n\np\n\ndet(1 +\n\nM M t)\n\n\u2202X I\n\u2202ua\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n1 + M tM\n\n\u0013\n\nIJ\n\n\u2202X J\n,\n\u2202ub\n\nMi J = \u2202i X J ,\n\n(2.10)\n\nand we have dropped the constant but infinite volume of a static Dp-brane. In deriving (2.10) we have\nused the matrix identity 1 \u2212 N t (1 + N N t )\u22121 N = (1 + N t N )\u22121 . Note also that for any real matrix N ,\nN t N is symmetric with non-negative eigenvalues. Hence 1 + M M t and 1 + M t M are always positive\ndefinite and therefore the inverse of the matrix 1+ M t M exists everywhere and is positive semi-definite\n(it can vanish at points were M t M diverges).\nFor some moduli the integral in (2.10) will not converge and these moduli must become frozen at\nlow energy. However for other modes, i.e. those whose effect on the embedding vanishes sufficiently\nquickly at infinity, the integral converges so that the action will have a finite kinetic term. Such moduli\nare said to be normalisable and are dynamical at low energy. The effective action is then a \u03c3-model\non the space of normalisable deformations of the surface with the metric (2.10).\nIn this paper we do not gauge fix to any particular brane. An advantage of this choice is that the\nsolutions are smooth embeddings at at all finite values of \u03c3 i and asymptotically approach flat branes\nfor large \u03c3 i . Therefore the only divergences in the integral (2.10) arise from the limit of large \u03c3 i where\nM becomes a constant matrix. Hence a modulus ua is normalisable if \u2202X I /\u2202ua falls off strictly faster\nthan |\u03c3|\u2212p/2 . This is analogous to a similar condition observed in [1] for normalisable metric moduli.\n\n3\n\nThree-Dimensional Intersections\n\nFor the rest of this paper we will restrict our attention to the case of intersecting D3-branes which\npreserve at least four supercharges. Our discussion also applies to various other intersecting Dp-branes.\nFor example we could replace all the D3-branes by D6-branes which intersect over a 3 + 1-dimensional\nflat space. The restriction to examples which preserve four supercharges guarantees that the wrapped\nbranes enjoy the equivalent of four-dimensional N = 1 supersymmetry. We will also discuss cases which\npreserve more supersymmetry where two D3-branes intersect on a line, which can alternatively replaced\nby two D2-branes intersecting over a point or two D5-branes intersecting over a 3+1-dimensional space.\nWe begin with the most general configuration of perpendicularly intersecting D3-branes which\npreserves four supercharges\nD3 : 1 2 3\nD\u03043 : 1\nD\u03043 :\n2\nD\u03043 :\n3\n\n4 5\n4\n6\n5 6\n\n(3.11)\n\nNote that for intersecting D3-branes there is a more general configuration but it only preserves two\nsupercharges and corresponds to associative three-cycle in R7 , for example see [5]. In particular the\n3\n\n\fbranes in (3.11) preserve the supersymmetries\n\u03930123 \u01eb1 = \u01eb2 ,\n\u03930154 \u01eb1 = \u2212\u01eb2 ,\n\n\u03930624 \u01eb1 = \u2212\u01eb2 ,\n\n\u03930653 \u01eb1 = \u2212\u01eb2 ,\n\n(3.12)\n\nrespectively. The product of any three of these projectors gives the fourth. Hence given any three\nof the branes in (3.11) one finds that the fourth can be included without breaking any additional\nsupersymmetries. In addition these preserved supersymmetries also allow for D3-branes which do not\nintersect at right angles. In total 1/8 of the spacetime supersymmetries are persevered by all the\nbranes. The choice of D3-brane or D\u03043-brane is arbitrary for any three of these branes, however once\nthis choice is made there is no such freedom for the fourth brane. We have made the above choice to\nsimplify the calculations below.\nIf we introduce complex coordinates2 Z 1 = X 1 + iX 6 , Z 2 = X 2 + iX 5 and Z 3 = X 3 + iX 4 then\nwe can construct the three-form dZ 1 \u2227 dZ 2 \u2227 dZ 3 of C3 = R6 and also the calibration\n\u03c9 = Re(dZ 1 \u2227 dZ 2 \u2227 dZ 3 )\n\n= dX 1 \u2227 dX 2 \u2227 dX 3 \u2212 dX 1 \u2227 dX 5 \u2227 dX 4 \u2212 dX 6 \u2227 dX 2 \u2227 dX 4 \u2212 dX 6 \u2227 dX 5 \u2227 dX 3 .\n\n(3.13)\n\nNote that, after imposing the constraints (3.12) this expression for \u03c9mnp agrees with (2.4). Clearly \u03c9\ncalibrates each of the brane worldvolumes in (3.11), i.e. the pull back of \u03c9 to the worldvolume is the\nvolume form (or minus the volume form for the anti-branes).\nFollowing [8] we introduce new coordinates Y m\nY1 =\nY4 =\n\n1\n\u221a (X 1 + X 6 ) ,\n2\n1\n\u221a (X 1 \u2212 X 6 ) ,\n2\n\n1\nY 2 = \u221a (X 2 + X 5 ) ,\n2\n1\n5\nY = \u221a (X 2 \u2212 X 5 ) ,\n2\n\n1\nY 3 = \u221a (X 3 + X 4 ) ,\n2\n1\n6\nY = \u221a (X 3 \u2212 X 4 ) .\n2\n(3.14)\n\nThe point of the Y m coordinates is that they do not favour any one brane over the others. Our next\nstep is to impose the static gauge \u03c3 i = Y i , i = 1, 2, 3. The coordinates Y I , I = 4, 5, 6 are now viewed\nas functions of \u03c3 i . In effect we have introduced an imaginary brane which lies at the same angle with\neach of the branes in (3.11).\nNext we need to solve \u0393\u01eb1 = \u01eb2 , where \u0393 is given in (2.1), for constant spinors \u01eb1 and \u01eb2 which\nsatisfy the constraints (3.12). It is helpful to introduce the matrix Mi j = \u2202i Y j+3 and also let \u0393\u0302i = \u0393i+3\n(so that \u0393i and \u0393\u0302i form two anti-commuting copies of the three-dimensional Clifford algebra). The\nsupersymmetry projections (3.12) are now equivalent to\n\u03931 \u0393\u03021 \u01eb1 = \u03932 \u0393\u03022 \u01eb1 = \u03933 \u0393\u03023 \u01eb1\n1\n1\n1\n\u221a \u03930 (\u03931 + \u0393\u03021 )\u039323 \u01eb1 = \u221a \u039301 (\u03932 + \u0393\u03022 )\u03933 \u01eb1 = \u221a \u0393012 (\u03933 + \u0393\u03023 )\u01eb1 = \u01eb2 .\n2\n2\n2\n(3.15)\n2\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nWe will have no need for the remaining three coordinates X , X , X in this paper.\n\n4\n\n\fExpanding out \u0393\u01eb1 = \u01eb2 leads to\n\u01eb2 =\n\n\u03930123\np\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\n\u2212det(g) \uf8f3\n\n1+\n\n1X\n(Mi j \u2212 Mj i )\u0393i \u0393\u0302j + tr(M )\u03931 \u0393\u03021\n2\ni<j\n\n\u001b\n1 ijk\nn 1\nl\nm\n\u2212det(M )\u0393 \u0393\u03021 \u2212 \u01eb \u01eblmn \u0393k \u0393\u0302 \u0393 \u0393\u03021 Mi Mj\n\u01eb1 .\n2\n1\n\n(3.16)\nTerms involving \u0393i \u0393\u0302j and \u0393i \u0393\u0302j \u03931 \u0393\u03021 with i 6= j must vanish to ensure that \u0393\u01eb1 = \u01eb2 . The vanishing of\nthe \u0393i \u0393\u0302j , i 6= j terms imply that\nMi j = Mj i .\n(3.17)\nIn addition (3.17) also ensures the vanishing of the \u0393i \u0393\u0302j \u03931 \u0393\u03021 , i 6= j terms. Once this is imposed the\nremaining terms can be rearranged and the condition \u0393\u01eb1 = \u221a12 \u03930 (\u03931 + \u0393\u03021 )\u039323 \u01eb1 = \u01eb2 becomes\ntr(1 + M ) =\n\n1\ndet(1 + M ) + 2 .\n2\n\n(3.18)\n\nIn general the condition (3.17) is solved by writing Y j+3 = \u2202j F for some potential F (\u03c3 i ). The first\ncondition then becomes a second order non-linear differential equation for F . We note that M = 0,\ni.e. a brane lying in the Y 1 , Y 2 , Y 3 plane, is not supersymmetric (with respect to the supersymmetries\n(3.12)). With these conventions the branes in (3.11) correspond to the solutions\nM\n\n= diag(+1, +1, +1) ,\n\nM\n\n= diag(+1, \u22121, \u22121) ,\n\nM\nM\n\n= diag(\u22121, +1, \u22121) ,\n\n= diag(\u22121, \u22121, +1) ,\n\n(3.19)\n\nrespectively.\nWe can also find the condition that \u0393\u01eb1 = \u2212\u01eb2 . From (3.16) we now find\ndet(1 + M ) = 2det(M ) + 2 ,\n\nMi j = Mj i .\n\n(3.20)\n\nFlipping all the signs in (3.19) gives solutions to (3.20) and describes the intersection\nD\u03043 :\nD3 :\n2 3\nD3 : 1\n3\nD3 : 1 2\n\n4 5 6\n6\n5\n4\n\n(3.21)\n\nHowever we will not devote any more time here to these embeddings.\nLet us compare these embedding conditions with the equation that results if we had instead imposed\nstatic gauge with respect to the first D3-brane, i.e \u03c31 = X 1 , \u03c32 = X 2 , \u03c33 = X 3 . The Bogomolnyi\ncondition was found in [5] to be\ndet(M\u0303 ) = tr(M\u0303 ) ,\n5\n\nM\u0303i j = M\u0303j i ,\n\n(3.22)\n\n\fwhere M\u0303i j = \u2202i X j+3 . This is the original Harvey-Lawson equation for a special Lagrangian embedding\n[6]. While this equation is somewhat simpler than (3.18) or (3.20), it has the disadvantage that only\nthe first brane in (3.11) appears as a solution; namely M\u0303 = 0.\nFinally, if (3.18) is satisfied then\np\n\u2212det(g) = 2|tr(M ) \u2212 det(M ))| ,\n\n(3.23)\n\nwhich is a total derivative. Note that the condition det(g) = 0 is the same as the the embedding\nequation (3.22) and corresponds to a surface that is calibrated with respect to \u03c9\u0303 = Re((dY 1 + idY 6 ) \u2227\n(dY 2 + idY 5 ) \u2227 (dY 3 + idY 4 )). However, as we saw above, 1 + M M t is positive definite and therefore\ndet(g) never vanishes. Hence surfaces which are calibrated with respect to \u03c9 and \u03c9\u0303 have no common\ntangents.\n\n3.1\n\nTwo D3-branes intersecting over a line\n\nBy describing intersecting branes as a single brane embedded into spacetime we are implicitly assuming\nthat the intersection point has been smoothed-out so that a manifold structure exists. Thus the general\nconfiguration of intersecting branes is realised as a smooth solution M (\u03c3 i ) to (3.18) which tends to\nthe constant solutions (3.19) in various limits. That such solutions exist is less clear. Let us therefore\nstart by discussing the simpler case of two intersecting D3-branes over a line. Here we can exploit the\nunderlying holomorphic structure to construct all the necessary solutions.\nIf we remove the first two D3-branes from (3.11) we obtain the brane configuration\n \u0304 : 2\nD3\n \u0304 :\nD3\n3\n\n4\n\n6\n5 6\n\n(3.24)\n\nThese branes preserve the supersymmetries\n\u03930624 \u01eb1 = \u2212\u01eb2 ,\n\n\u03930653 \u01eb1 = \u2212\u01eb2 ,\n\n(3.25)\n\nrespectively. Hence they preserve a common 1/4 of the spacetime supersymmetries.\nFrom the worldvolume of our imaginary brane this is achieved by fixing Y 4 = \u2212\u03c3 1 and restricting\nY and Y 6 to be independent of \u03c3 1 . The Bogomoln'yi conditions (3.18) then reduce to\n5\n\n\u22022 Y 5 = \u2212\u22023 Y 6 ,\n\n\u22022 Y 6 = \u22023 Y 5 .\n\n(3.26)\n\nThese equations are readily recognized as the Cauchy-Riemann equations which are solved by introducing complex coordinates\nZ = Y 6 + iY 5 , w = \u03c3 2 + i\u03c3 3 .\n(3.27)\nIn this case the full non-linear Bogomoln'yi equations reduce to [9]\n \u0304 =0.\n\u2202Z\n\n(3.28)\n\nSolutions to (3.28) that represent intersecting branes are of course easy to constuct following [10].\nThey may be implicitly described by a holomorphic equation E(Z, w) = 0. We are interested two\nintersecting branes so that for each w (except for some isolated points) there should be two solutions\nfor Z. Thus we write E = A(w)Z 2 + B(w)Z + C(w). Furthermore, for w \u2192 \u221e, the branes should\n6\n\n\fFigure 1: A holomorphic embedding of 2 D3-branes\nresemble flat planes, i.e. Z \u223c \u03bbw in which case the angle between the two branes is \u03b8 = 2arctan|\u03bb|. In\naddition there should be no other points where Z \u2192 \u221e. Thus A = 1, B should be linear in w and C\nquadratic. Without loss of generality we may shift Z to set B = 0 and write C(w) = \u03bb2 (w \u2212 w0 )2 \u2212 \u03b12\nso that\np\n(3.29)\nZ = \u00b1 \u03b12 \u2212 \u03bb2 (w \u2212 w0 )2 .\n\nAn artist's impression of part of this curve is in figure 1, the full curve is a two-dimensional surface in\nfour dimensions and is connected. The solid line represents the curve and the dashed lines represent\nthe undeformed intersection. The two branches, i.e. choices of sign, correspond to the top and bottom\nhalf of the curve. There are two branch points w = w0 \u00b1 \u03b1/\u03bb and so the full solution consists of two\ncopies of the complex w plane. Clearly \u03b1 plays the role of smoothing out the intersection, w0 describes\nthe location of the intersection and \u03bb controls the angle between the two branes. As w \u2192 \u221e we find\nthat\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u22121\n0\n0\nM \u2192 \uf8ed 0 \u00b1Re(\u03bb) \u2213Im(\u03bb) \uf8f8 .\n(3.30)\n0 \u2213Im(\u03bb) \u2213Re(\u03bb)\nThus for \u03bb2 = 1 these are indeed smooth curves that interpolate between two of the constant solutions\nin (3.19).\n\nWe could also try to find smooth solutions which interpolate between other pairs of branes in (3.11).\nFor the middle two branes we perform an analogous construction but now with the \u03c33 dependence\nconstrained to be Y 6 = \u2212\u03c33 . The second and fourth branes are also analogous but we impose Y 5 =\n\u2212\u03c32 . However if we try to consider the intersection of the first and second branes in a similar manner\nthen we must set Y 4 = \u03c31 . As a result the Bogomoln'yi equation (3.18) does not simplify to a complex\nembedding condition. Instead we find the two-dimensional Monge-Ampere equation\n\u220222 U \u220232 U \u2212 (\u22022 \u22023 U )2 = 1 ,\n\n(3.31)\n\nwhere as before we set Y i+3 = \u2202i F and take F = 12 \u03c312 + U (\u03c32 , \u03c33 ). Analogous equations arise for the\nother intersections involving the first brane.\nFrom the symmetry of the original problem it is clear that there should be no physical difference between smooth intersections of the first brane with the others and the complex intersections constructed\n7\n\n\fabove. Indeed let us change coordinates to3\nw\u0303 = Im(Z) \u2212 iRe(w) ,\n\nZ\u0303 = \u2212Re(Z) \u2212 iIm(w) .\n\n(3.32)\n\nNote that now neither w\u0303 or Z\u0303 are simply worldvolume coordinates or embedding coordinates. After a\n \u0304\nlittle calculation however one can show that the condition \u2202 \u0303Z\u0303 = 0 becomes\n\u2202Z = \u2202 \u0304Z\u0304 ,\n\n \u0304 2=1.\n|\u2202Z|2 \u2212 |\u2202Z|\n\n(3.33)\n\n \u0304 where U is a real function. We now find that the second\nThe first condition implies that Z = 2\u2202U\ncondition in (3.33) is precisely the Monge-Ampere equation (3.31).\nTo illustrate this point one can see that taking Z\u0303(w\u0303) to have the form (3.29) (and setting w0 = 0,\n\u03b12 real and \u03bb2 = 1 for simplicity) produces the solution\nr\nw\n(3.34)\nZ = \u00b1 w2 + \u03b12 ,\nw\u0304\nunder the change in static gauge given in (3.32). In this case the corresponding function U\np only\n2\n2\ndepends on \u03c32 + \u03c33 and can be readily seen to solve (3.31). Note that near w = 0, Z \u223c |\u03b1| w/w\u0304\n \u0304 diverge, i.e. at w = 0 there is a circle of radius |\u03b1|. This is a\nis non-vanishing although \u2202Z and \u2202Z\nfailure of static gauge and is easily resolved by reflecting the solution across this circle and corresponds\nto choosing the opposite sign for the embedding in (3.34) (recall that in the holomorphic case this\ncorresponds to going onto the second sheet of the Riemann surface). A sketch of this intersection is\ntherefore identical to figure 1 but rotated by \u03c0/2.\nHence solutions to the Monge-Ampere equation can be found by taking any holomorphic embedding\n \u0304\nZ\u0303(w\u0303). We note that the converse is not true. For example one can check that starting with Z\u0303(w\u0303, w\u0303)\n2\n2\nof the form (3.34) also leads to a solution Z(w, w\u0304) of (3.31) (this time U only depends on \u03c32 \u2212 \u03c33 ).\nAlthough again one can find coordinates in which this embedding is holomorphic. Therefore the\nnon-linearity in the Monge-Ampere equation merely reflects an awkward choice of static gauge.\n\n3.2\n\nThree D3-branes Intersecting Over a Point\n\nIn the previous section we explicitly constructed solutions to the embedding equation (3.18) that\ndescribed the resolution of any pairs of branes in (3.11) in single smooth complex surface. Next we\nwould like to obtain solutions to the embedding equation (3.18) which depend non-trivially on all three\ncoordinates and describe smooth deformations of three intersecting branes.\n3.2.1\n\nSO(3) symmetry\n\nWe consider\nthe simplest possibility of a spherically symmetric ansatz, namely Y i+3 = \u2202i F (r) where\np\nr = \u03c312 + \u03c322 + \u03c332 . Substituting this into (3.18) leads to a second order differential equation which\ncan be integrated once to give\nu3\nG3 + 3G2 \u2212 3G \u2212 1 = 3 ,\n(3.35)\nr\n3\n\nI thank N. Constable and W. Taylor for suggesting this change of coordinates.\n\n8\n\n\f20\n\n10\n\n\u20134\n\n\u20133\n\n\u20132\nG\n\n\u20131\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\u201310\n\nFigure 2: u3 /r 3 as a function of G\nwhere G = F \u2032 /r and u is an arbitrary constant. A plot of the cubic equation is given in figure\n2. The embedding is then found by Y i+3 = \u03c3 i G(r). Thus for a generic value of r we find three\nsolutions which\ncan be interpreted as three D3-branes. As r \u2192 \u00b1\u221e the solutions are G = 1, \u22122 \u2212\n\u221a\n\u221a\n3, \u22122 + 3. This corresponds to three flat D3-branes. In particular G = 1 describes a D3-brane\nin the X 1 , X 2 , X 3\u221a\n-plane while the other two solutions correspond to two D3-branes in the planes\n4\n5\n6\n(X , X , X ) = \u00b1 3(X 1 , X 2 , X 3 ). This is precisely the intersection considered in [2]. Just as in the\nMonge-Ampere example, r = 0 is not a singularity but an artifact of static gauge. Instead we see that,\nas r \u2192 0, Y i+3 = u\u03c3 i /r, i.e. the coordinates lie on a 2-sphere. We can construct a smooth manifold by\nattaching another copy of the solution, where r is negative and gluing it to this 2-sphere. Our resident\nartist's impression of this curve is given in figure 3, but some explanation is required. First we start\nat on the D3-brane corresponding to G = 1 at r = +\u221e. As r decreases (without loss of generality we\nassume that u > 0) but is still positive we move left on figure 3 until r goes to zero. However we\n\u221a can\nsmoothly pass here to r < 0 and we continue on the left of figure two until we reach G = \u22122 \u2212 3 as\nr \u2192 \u2212\u221e. This is plotted as the top part \u221a\nof the curve in figure 3. Next we construct another branch\nof the solution by starting at G = \u22122 \u2212 3 and r = \u221e and then moving further right on figure\u221a2\npassing through a minimum value of r (i.e. a maximum value of G) and finally out to G = \u22122 + 3\nas r \u2192 \u221e again. This is plotted as part of the curve on the right and below the horizontal in figure\u221a3.\nFinally a third branch is constructed if we continue on moving right on figure two from G = \u22122 + 3\nas r \u2192 \u2212\u221e, through a maximum value of |r| (i.e. a minimum value of G) again until we get to G = 1\nat r = \u2212\u221e. This is plotted as the part of the curve on the left and below the horizontal axis in figure\nthree. The rest of the curve arises as a result of the spherical symmetry. In particular sections of\nthe curve which are refected into each other through the origin are in fact connected by the SO(3)\nsymmetry in the full six dimensions.\nThus the curve plotted in figure 3 apparently smoothly interpolates between all three pairs of branes\nwhich are are 2\u03c0/3 angles with each other. However one can see from figure 3 that each of the three\nD3-branes is deformed in two directions. Clearly a single D3-brane can only choose one such way to\nbend. This can be overcome by considering two of each of the D3-branes, which are asymptotically\nparallel and coincident. The full curve then represents the blow up of six D3-branes into a smooth\nSpecial Lagrangian.\n\n9\n\n\fFigure 3: 6 D3-branes embedded as a special Lagrangian\n\nFigure 4: 3 D3-branes embedded as a special Lagrangian\n\nFigure 5: 4 D3-branes embedded as a special Lagrangian\n\n10\n\n\f\u221a\n\u221a\nIf we recall that X i = (Y i + Y i+3 )/ 2 and X i+3 = (Y i \u2212 Y i+3 )/ 2 then we can define\nr\n\u221a 1 + G i+3\n11\u2212G i\ni\nX , \u03c6i2 = 3\nX\n.\n\u03c61 =\n31+G\n1\u2212G\n\n(3.36)\n\nNow (3.35) becomes\n~1 * \u03c6\n~ 2 = \u2212sgn(G2 \u2212 1)|\u03c6\n~ 1 ||\u03c6\n~2 | ,\n\u03c6\n\n~ 1 |(3|\u03c6\n~ 1 |2 \u2212 |\u03c6~2 |2 ) = \u03c1 ,\n|\u03c6\n\n(3.37)\n\n\u221a\nwhere \u03c1 = u3 / 6. For |G| > 1 this is the equation for the curve first discussed in [6] and more recently\nin [2]. In particular the construction of [2] consists of keeping only one section of the curve, which\nsmooths out the intersection between two D3-branes, while the third brane remains flat and shoots\nthrough the hole created by the others. The resulting embedding is sketched in figure 4. Another\nconstuction of [2] is to simply delete the flat brane that shoots through the middle, i.e. just to consider\nthe intersection of two D3-branes.\nIn a sense the region |G| \u2265 1 contains one and a half copies of the curve discussed in [2] since,\nin addition\nto a patch which interpolates between one D3-brane with G = 1 and another with G =\n\u221a\n\u22122 \u2212 3, the\n\u221a region |G| \u2265 1 also includes a portion of the curve that approaches the brane at\nG = \u22122 \u2212 3 and then, apparently, abruptly ends at G = \u22121. To resolve this we may extend to\nall values of G to get the embedding sketched in figure 3. In effect this contains three copies of the\ncurve in [2],\n\u221a whereby all three branes are smoothed out. Alternatively we may only extend as far as\nG = \u22122+ 3 which corresponds to keeping only two sections of the curve in figure 3 and again all three\nD3-branes are smoothed out. This is sketched in figure 5. However here again the middle D3-brane\nis deformed in both directions and thus must be replaced by a pair of asymptotically parrallel and\ncoincident D3-branes. Hence it really represents the embedding of four seperate D3-branes.\n3.2.2\n\nU (1) symmetry\n\nNext we would like to discuss intersections which are invariant only under a U (1) symmetry. In particular recently special Lagrangian surfaces in C3 which are invariant under (Z 1 , Z 2 , Z 3 ) \u2192 (Z 1 , ei\u03b8 Z 2 , e\u2212i\u03b8 Z 3 )\nhave been discussed in relation to mirror symmetry [11].\nIf we consider the coordinates that we introduced in (3.32) then, under this action,\nw\u0303 \u2192 e\u2212i\u03b8 w\u0303 ,\n\nZ\u0303 \u2192 e\u2212i\u03b8 Z\u0303 .\n\n(3.38)\n\nTherefore our task is to generalise the embeddings in section 3.1 to include a non-trivial dependence\non \u03c31 and a non-holomorphic dependence on w\u0303 while respecting the symmetry (3.38). Therefore the\n \u0304 \u03c31 ), where A is an arbitrary function. Examining the\nmost general ansatz is to write Z\u0303 = w\u0303A(w\u0303 w\u0303,\ninfinitessimal version of the transformation (3.38), and using the fact that \u22022 Y 6 = \u22023 Y 5 , we learn that\n|Z\u0303|2 \u2212 |w\u0303|2 = 2a(\u03c31 ). Hence we find\nr\n2a\n(3.39)\nZ\u0303 = \u00b1w\u0303 1 +  \u0304 ei\u03b8 ,\nw\u0303 w\u0303\n \u0304 Note that the dependence of Z\u0303 on w\u0303 at a fixed value of \u03c31\nwhere \u03b8 is real and depends on \u03c31 and w\u0303 w\u0303.\nis similar to the embedding (3.34). One simple ansatz for a solution is to take \u03b8 and a to be constant\n\n11\n\n\fand Y 4 linear in \u03c31 . This gives example 5.2 in [11] (with \u03b3 = 0) and is essentially the holomorphic\nembedding (3.29) written in peculiar coordinates. Taking the limit |w\u0303| \u2192 \u221e and solving (3.18) we find\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb 1+tan(\u03b8)\n0\n0\n1\u2212tan(\u03b8)\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n1\n\u00b1 sin(\u03b8)\n(3.40)\n0\n\u00b1 cos(\u03b8)\nM \u2192\uf8ed\n\uf8f8 .\nsin(\u03b8)\n0\n\n1\n\u00b1 sin(\u03b8)\n\n\u00b1 cos(\u03b8)\nsin(\u03b8)\n\nThis corresponds to a smooth intersection of two D3-branes which asymptotically lie in the planes\ndefined by\nX4 =\n\n1\nX 2 \u00b1 tan(\u03b8)X 3 ,\ncos(\u03b8)\n\nX5 =\n\n1\nX 3 \u00b1 tan(\u03b8)X 2 ,\ncos(\u03b8)\n\nX 6 = tan(\u03b8)X 1 .\n\n(3.41)\n\nLess trivial solutions are more difficult to construct. However an existance proof has been given in\n[11] (in addition we learn that a is always constant). Nevertheless the fact that these solutions take\nthe form (3.39) allows us to make some remarks about the D3-brane interpretation. Just as above the\napparent divergence at w\u0303 = 0 is an artifact of static gauge which is cured by adding a copy of the\ncurve corresponding to the opposite choice of sign in (3.39). Assuming that \u03b8 is independent of |w\u0303| as\nw\u0303 \u2192 \u221e we see that for a fixed value of \u03c31 there are two flat D3-branes which asymptotically take the\nform (3.41). Thus these special Lagrangians involve two intersecting D3-branes which are in a sense\ntwisted and tilted along \u03c31 .\n\n3.3\n\nModuli and Superpotentials\n\nThe existence of smooth solutions that represent intersecting branes is a signal that there is a Higg's\nbranch in the gauge theory living on the intersection. Atiyah and Witten [1] have argued that, at least\nfor the case of three D-branes intersecting at 2\u03c0/3 angles, there is a superpotential\nW = \u03a612 \u03a623 \u03a631 ,\n\n(3.42)\n\nwhere, for example, \u03a612 is the chiral multiplet associated to the open strings that stretch from the first\nto the second D3-brane. Thus the only flat directions along the Higg's branch are when one and only\none scalar field is non-vanishing, in which case the other two scalar fields become massive.\nThe existence of such a potential implies that the space of classical smooth solutions to the calibration equation (3.18) has several branches. Choosing to give a vev to a particular multiplet, say \u03a612 ,\nis naturally interpreted as smoothing-out the intersection of the first and second branes. However,\ndue to the potential, once this is done the other smoothing-out modes are massive. A result of this\ninterpretation is that there should be no smooth solution that interpolates between all three D3-branes,\nbut smooth solutions between any two pairs of branes should exist. We note that the superpotential\n(3.42) is supposed to arise as a non-perturbative disk instanton effect [1] and therefore it may seem\nunlikely that its effects can be visible in the classical description of special Lagaranian surfaces presented here. However the disk instanton in question has zero-size and the superpotential accordingly\nis not surpressed by any factor of \u03b1\u2032 . Thus one may expect that the classical geometry is sensitive to\nthe superpotential. In any case we will see that the solutions we found above are naturally classified\nin terms of the flat directions of a non-Abelian superpotential on the moduli space.\nFor completeness we first consider the case of two D3-branes over a line. Since these configurations\nin fact preserve eight supercharges a superpotential is forbidden. The moduli space is then simply that\n12\n\n\f \u0304 = 0 implies\nof complex curves with the relevant boundary conditions. The holomorphic condition \u2202Z\nthat the effective Lagrangian (2.9) is simply\nZ\n\u2202Z \u2202 Z\u0304\n(3.43)\nLef f = d2 w a b \u2202 \u03bc ua \u2202\u03bc ub .\n\u2202u \u2202u\nNote that since two D3-branes intersect over a line, it is natural to allow the moduli ua to depend on this\nspatial direction as well as time. Hence Lef f is a two-dimensional Lagrangian and we have accordingly\nintroduced \u03bc = 0, 1 to label these directions. It follows from our discussion in section 2 that (3.43)\ndiverges and hence none of the moduli in (3.29) are normalisable. However by introducing additional\nbranes in various ways one can find examples where some of the moduli can be made normalisable and\nthe \u03c3-model produces a non-trivial effective action [12, 13, 14].\nReturning to the case of D3-branes at 2\u03c0/3 angles and the solution (3.35) we find that, in contrast\nto perpendicularly intersecting branes, the modulus u is normalisable. Furthermore one can show that\n(2.9) becomes\nLef f = \u03bau3 u\u03072 ,\n(3.44)\nwhere \u03ba is a finite, positive constant. We noted above that (3.18) and hence the associated modulus\nu led to three interpretations, although this required having parallel pairs of D3-branes rather than\nthree single D3-branes with Abelian gauge fields.\nWe can understand the appearances of these interpretation from the gauge theory potential (3.42)\nas follows. If we have N , N \u2032 and N \u2032\u2032 of each D3-brane then the moduli coming from stretched strings\nare in bifundamental representations of the U (N ) \u00d7 U (N \u2032 ) \u00d7 U (N \u2032\u2032 ) gauge group of the D3-branes. In\nparticular the analogue of (3.42) is\n\u2032 b\u2032 c\u2032\u2032 c\u2032\u2032 a\nW = \u03a6ab\n(3.45)\n12 \u03a623 \u03a631 ,\nwhere a = 1, .., N , b\u2032 = 1, ..., N \u2032 and c\u2032\u2032 = 1, ..., N \u2032\u2032 . The supersymmetric vacuum moduli space (i.e.\nextrema of W ) is now much larger than the Abelian case and satisfies\n\u2032\n\n\u2032 \u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032 \u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nbc\nbc\nc a\nc a ab\n\u03a6ab\n12 \u03a623 = \u03a623 \u03a631 = \u03a631 \u03a612 = 0 .\n\n(3.46)\n\n\u2032 , \u03a6\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nIf we write \u03a612 = V12 \u2297 V12\n23 = V23 \u2297 V23 and \u03a631 = V31 \u2297 V31 then (3.46) becomes\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\n(V12\n* V23\n)V12 \u2297 V23\n= (V23\n* V31\n)V23\n\u2297 V31 = (V12 * V23 )V31\n\u2297 V12\n=0.\n\n(3.47)\n\nTherefore we can identify three types of branches of the supersymmetric vacuum moduli space.\nFirstly the branches which existed in the Abelian case are still present. Here only one scalar field, say\n\u03a612 , is non-vanishing. Up to a gauge transformation there are three, one-dimensional branches of these\nvacua. Secondly there is a symmetric branch where none of the scalar fields vanish. In these cases\n\u2032 * V \u2032 = V \u2032\u2032 * V \u2032\u2032 = 0. Up to gauge transformations there is an (N \u2212 1)(N \u2032 \u2212 1)(N \u2032\u2032 \u2212 1)V12 * V23 = V12\n31\n23\n23\ndimensional branch of such vacua. Lastly there will also be three mixed branches where only one scalar\n\u2032 *V \u2032 = 0 and hence, up to gauge transformations,\nfield vanishes. For example if \u03a631 = 0 then we find V12\n23\nthere is an (N \u2032 \u2212 1)-dimensional branch of the vacuum moduli space. Similarly there are also (N \u2032\u2032 \u2212 1)dimensional and (N \u2212 1)-dimensional branches for \u03a612 = 0 and \u03a623 = 0 respectively. Note that the\nexistance of one of these mixed branches requires that only one of gauge groups is non-Abelian.\nFor the case at hand where N = N \u2032 = N \u2032\u2032 = 2 all of these vacuum branches are one-dimensional\nand we can identify them with the explicit curves found in section 3.2. In particular the Abelian\nbranches, where only one scalar is choosen to be non-vanishing, correspond to the curve studied in\n13\n\n\f[2], where one pair of D3-branes is blown up and the third shoots through the middle (figure 4). The\nthree branches are obviously associated with the three choices of which branes to smooth out. We\nalso considered a curve (figure 3) which smooths out all three D3-branes but noted that this required\nhaving two copies of each D3-brane. This corresponds to the symmetric vacuum branch. Finally we\nfound curves (figure 5) where all three D3-branes were smoothed out, but not in a symmetric manner.\nClearly the three possible choices for which brane is in the middle can be identified with with the three\nmixed branches of the vacuum moduli space.\nFinally we note that the pairs of parallel D3-branes coincide at infinity. It is natural then to ask\nif there is an associated solution where they are separated. To answer this we note that separating a\nparticular pair of D3-branes corresponds to giving a non-zero vev to one of the adjoint scalar fields.\nSince the \u03a6\u03b1\u03b2 modes are in bifundamental representations of the gauge group they will become massive\nvia a Higg's effect. Therefore in such a vacuum the relevant \u03a6\u03b1\u03b2 scalars must vanish. Hence there\nshould be no moduli correpsonding to seperating the branes.\n\n4\n\nRelation to non-compact G2 manifolds\n\nThe discussion above focused on D3-branes. However nothing substantial changes if we instead consider\nD6-branes which are also extended along X 7 , X 8 , X 9 . As first pointed out in [15] (see also [16, 17]),\nupon lifting these D6-branes to M-theory we find a solution which is pure geometry (i.e. the four-form\nfield strength vanishes). The fact that four-dimensional N = 1 supersymmetry is preserved along the\nX 0 , X 7 , X 8 , X 9 directions further implies that the remaining seven-dimensional geometry M has G2\nholonomy.\nFrom the point of view of special Lagrangian surfaces the three types of SO(3) invariant solutions\nthat we have described seem rather trivially related. In particular they simply correspond to various\ntruncations of the curve plotted in figure 3. However upon lifting to M-theory these curves are associated to different G2 manifolds. To see this we can determine the topology of the M using the elegant\nformula derived in [18]\nh2 (M ) = h0 (L) \u2212 1 ,\n\nh\u03b1+2 (M ) = h\u03b1 (L) , \u03b1 = 0, 1, 2, 3 ,\n\n(4.48)\n\nwhere L is the special Lagrangian. The three special Lagrangian embeddings L that we discussed in\nsection 3.2.1 have (h0 (L), h2 (L)) = (3, 3), (2, 1) and (2, 2) for figures 3,4 and 5 respectively, with all\nother Betti numbers vanishing. Therefore, upon lifting to M-theory, they correspond to G2 manifolds\nM such that (h0 (M ), h2 (M ), h4 (M )) = (1, 2, 3), (1, 1, 1) and (1, 1, 2) respectively, with all other Betti\nnumbers vanishing. The second case is known to correspond to an R3 bundle over CP2 [1, 2]. The\nother manifolds have h4 > 1 and thus cannot be R3 bundles over a smooth four-dimensional surface,\nalthough they might be related to resolutions of the orbifold constructions in [19]. Furthermore the\nexistance of the large vacuum moduli space discussed in section 3.3 for bigger gauge groups, i.e. many\nparallel D3-branes, suggests that there is a wealth of additional G2 manifolds related to the special\nLagrangian curve (3.18). However it is less clear what the geometrical picture of these additional\ndeformations is.\nThe U (1) invariant solutions we discussed also lift to G2 manifolds. These have (h0 (L), h2 (L)) =\n(1, 1) and hence lift to manifolds with (h0 (M ), h2 (M ), h4 (M )) = (1, 0, 1). This suggests that their lift\nis topologically an R4 bundle over S4 . Indeed a G2 manifold with this form was discussed in [1, 2] and\nis the lift of two intersecting D6-branes at 2\u03c0/3 angles (corresponding to the SO(3) invariant curve in\n14\n\n\ffigure 4 with the flat D3-brane is deleted). Since the U (1) invariant special Lagrangians describe two\nD6-branes lying in the planes defined by (3.41) it is natural to suppose that that their associated G2\nmanifolds can be continuously connected to the R4 bundle over S4 of [1, 2].\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper we revisted the worldvolume analysis for intersecting D-branes, including a discussion\nof the moduli space metric. We then focused our discussion on D3-brane intersections which preserve\nfour supercharges. In particular we found a new embedding condition which treats all D3-branes on\nan equal footing. We also discussed some solutions to this condition and identified their moduli space\nwith the vacuum branches of a non-Abelian superpotential. Upon lifting to M-theory these solutions\nimply the existance on new G2 manifolds.\nIt would be of interest to find more explicit solutions to the special Lagrangian embedding equation\n(3.18). Since we have found all the solutions that are predicted by the superpotential (3.42) for the\ncase of D3-branes at 2\u03c0/3 angles, it seems natural to assume that any new solutions will satisfy\ndifferent boundary conditions. It would also be interesting to find solutions which represent all four\nintersecting D3-branes. However we note that in the solition (3.35) the three distinct D3-branes\nat infinity correspond to the three solutions to a cubic equation. Since (3.18) is at most cubic in\nthe embedding coordinates it seems that solutions with more than three D3-branes are impossible.\nFinally it would be interesting to derive embedding equations which to do not prefer one D-brane over\nthe others for configurations with less supersymmetry, such as associative, co-associative and spin(7)\ncalibrations.\nAcknowledgments\nI would like to thank B.
