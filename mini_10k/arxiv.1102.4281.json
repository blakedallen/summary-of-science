INTRODUCTION\nLet G be a finitely generated group. The rank of G is the minimal\ncardinality of a generating set, and is denoted by rk(G). If Gj is a finite\nindex subgroup of G, the Reidemeister-Schreier process ([LS]) gives an\nupper bound on the rank of Gj .\nrk(Gj ) \u2212 1 \u2264 [G : Gj ](rk(G) \u2212 1)\nRecently Lackenby introduced the notion of rank gradient ([La1]). Given\na finitely generated group G and a collection {Gj } of finite index subgroups, the rank gradient of the pair (G, {Gj }) is defined by\nrk(Gj ) \u2212 1\nj\u2192\u221e [G : Gj ]\n\nrgr(G, {Gj }) = lim\n\nWe say that the collection of finite index subgroups {Gj } is co-final if\n\u2229j Gj = {1}, and we call it a tower if Gj+1 < Gj .\nIn some particular cases it is easy to determine rank gradient, for\nexample:\n(1) When G is a free group, the rank gradient of any pair (G, {Gj })\nis positive.\n(2) The same is true if G is the fundamental group of a closed\nsurface S with \u03c7(S) < 0;\n(3) If G \u2212\u2212\u0010 F2 , where F2 is the free group on two generators then,\nusing (1), one can find a tower (not co-final) of subgroups with\npositive rank gradient;\n1\n\nAuthor supported by CAPES/Fulbright Grant BEX 2411/05-9\n1\n\n\f2\n\nDARLAN GIR\u00c3O\n\n(4) If G is virtually abelian or if G is the fundamental group of\na virtually fibered 3-manifold then there are towers with zero\nrank gradient. In the latter case we consider the subgroups\ncoming from the cyclic covers of the fibered manifold.\n(5) SL(n, Z), n > 2, has zero rank gradient with respect to towers\nof congruence subgroups ([Ti], [La1]).\nHowever, determining the rank gradient of a co-final tower is very hard\nin general. For example, the following question is the motivation for\nthis note:\nQuestion 1. Does there exist a torsion free finite covolume Kleinian\ngroup G with a co-final tower {Gj } such that rgr(G, {Gj }) > 0.\nThe main result of this note provides infinitely many such examples.\nTo state it we introduce some notation.\nIf M1 is an orientable finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifold, we call\nthe family of covers {Mj \u2212\u2192 M1 } co-final (resp. a tower ) if {\u03c01 (Mj )}\nis co-final (resp. a tower). By rank gradient of the the pair (M1 , {Mj }),\nrgr(M1 , {Mj }), we mean the rank gradient of (\u03c01 (M1 ), {\u03c01 (Mj )}).\nTheorem 3.1. Let M1 be an orientable finite volume hyperbolic 3manifold whose fundamental group has finite index in the reflection\ngroup of a totally geodesic right-angled ideal polyhedron P1 in H3 . Then\nthere exists a co-final tower of finite sheeted covers {Mj \u2212\u2192 M } with\npositive rank gradient.\nThis theorem relates to the work of Ab\u00e9rt and Nikolov ([AN]), and\nin particular to a question about cost of group actions ([Ga]).\nQuestion 2. Let G be finitely generated and {Gj } be a co-final tower of\nnormal subgroups of G. Does rgr(G, {Gj }) depend on the tower {Gj }?\nOur result provides negative evidence for this question. If one could\nimprove Theorem 3.1 by finding a co-final tower {Mj \u2212\u2192 M1 } of regular covers with positive rank gradient, then we claim it would also be\npossible to find one with zero rank gradient. In fact, Agol proved in\n[Ag] that if the fundamental group of a 3-dimensional manifold satisfies\nan algebraic condition, called RFRS, then it virtually fibers. He also\nproved in [Ag] that the manifolds of the type considered in Theorem\n3.1 are virtually RFRS. Therefore, given M1 as in Theorem 3.1, it is\npossible to find a tower {\u0393j } with rgr(\u03c01 (M1 ), {\u0393j }) = 0. By taking\nthe core of \u0393j in \u03c01 (M1 ) (i.e., core(\u0393j ) = \u2229g\u2208\u03c01 (M1 ) g\u0393j g \u22121 ), one sees\nthat the tower of normal subgroups {core(\u0393j )} has zero rank gradient.\nThe desired co-final tower with zero rank gradient would be given by\n{\u03c01 (Mj ) \u2229 core(\u0393j )}.\n\n\fRANK GRADIENT IN CO-FINAL TOWERS\n\n3\n\nThe main idea of the proof of Theorem 3.1 is as follows: given P1 as in\nthe theorem, construct a collection of polyhedra {Pj } whose reflection\ngroups have finite index 2j\u22121 in the reflection group of P1 . If one is given\nan orientable hyperbolic 3-manifold M1 whose fundamental group has\nfinite index in the reflection group of P1 then M1 has at least as many\ncusps as the number of vertices of P1 . We may find manifold covers\nMj \u2212\u2192 M1 so that Mj is a 2j\u22121 -sheeted covering and has at least as\nmany cusps as the number of ideal vertices of Pj . We then show that\nthe Pj can be chosen so that the number of its vertices is of the same\nmagnitude as 2j .\nThe paper will be organized as follows: section 2 sets up notation\nand we recall a characterization of right-angled ideal polyhedra using\nAndreev's theorem ([An]). We then show how the construction of the\nfamily {Pj } will be done. In section 3 we prove Theorem 3.1. Section\n4 contains all the technical results we need to estimate rk(\u03c01 (Mj )). In\nsection 5 we show how to construct {Pj } so that the family {Mj } is cofinal. The idea for this appears in [Ag] (Theorem 2.2) and we include\na proof here for completeness. Section 6 contains some final remarks\nand further questions.\nACKOWLEDGEMENTS\nI am very grateful to my thesis advisor, Alan Reid, for his extraordinary guidance and unwavering support.

SET UP\nAn abstract polyhedron P1 is a cell complex on S 2 which can be\nrealized by a convex Euclidean polyhedron. A labeling of P1 is a map\n\u0398 : Edges(P1 ) \u2212\u2192 (0, \u03c0/2]\nThe pair (P1 , \u0398) is a labeled abstract polyhedron. A labeled abstract\npolyhedron is said to be realizable as a hyperbolic polyhedron if there\nexists a hyperbolic polyhedron P1 such that there is a label preserving\ngraph isomorphism between the 1-skeleton of P1 with edges labeled by\ndihedral angles and the 1-skeleton of P1 with edges labeled by \u0398.\nLet P1 be a totally geodesic right-angled ideal polyhedron in H3 (that\nis, faces of P1 are contained in hyperplanes and all vertices of P1 lie in\n2\nthe boundary at infinity S\u221e\n, where we here we consider the ball model\n3\nfor H ). We consider the 1-skeleton of P1 as a graph \u03931 \u2282 S 2 with labels\n\n\f4\n\nDARLAN GIR\u00c3O\n\n\u03b8e = \u03c0/2. Let \u0393\u22171 be its dual graph. A k-circuit is a simple closed curve\ncomposed of k edges in \u0393\u22171 . A prismatic k-circuit is a k-circuit \u03b3 so\nthat no two edges of \u03931 which correspond to edges traversed by \u03b3 share\na vertex. Andreev's theorem for right-angled ideal polyhedra in H3\n([An], see also [At]) can be stated as:\nTheorem 2.1. Let P1 be an abstract polyhedron. Then P1 is realizable\nas a right-angled ideal polyhedron P1 if and only if\n(1) P1 has at least 6 faces;\n(2) Vertices have valence 4;\n(3) For any triple of faces of P1 , (fi , fj , fk ), such that fi \u2229 fj and\nfj \u2229 fk are edges of P1 with distinct endpoints, fi \u2229 fk = \u2205;.\n(4) There are no prismatic 4-circuits.\nThe above theorem implies that the 1-skeleton of P1 is a 4-valent\ngraph. The faces can therefore be checkerboard colored. Reflecting\nP1 along a face f1 gives a polyhedron P2 which is also right-angled,\nideal and totally geodesic with checkerboard colored faces (see figure\nbelow). We construct a sequence of polyhedra P1 , P2 , ..., Pj , ... recursively, whereby Pj+1 is obtained from Pj by reflection along a face fj .\nThe faces of Pj+1 are colored accordingly with the coloring of the faces\nof Pj .\nThe notation for the remainder of the paper is as follows: the number\nof vertices in the face fj is denoted by Sfj and \u03c6fj denotes the reflection\nalong fj . Bj and Wj represent the maximal number of ideal vertices\non a black or white face of the polyhedron Pj , respectively. Vj denotes\nthe total number of vertices on Pj .\nThroughout, the construction of the polyhedra Pj will be done in an\nalternating fashion with respect to the color of the faces: P2j is obtained\nfrom P2j\u22121 by refection along a black face and P2j+1 is obtained from\nP2j by reflection along a white face.\n\nFigure 1. Polyhedron P1 reflected along central black\nface yields P2\n\n\fRANK GRADIENT IN CO-FINAL TOWERS\n\n5\n\n3. MAIN THEOREM\nIn this section we prove:\nTheorem 3.1. Let M1 be an orientable finite volume hyperbolic 3manifold whose fundamental group has finite index in the reflection\ngroup of a right-angled ideal polyhedron P1 in H3 . Then there exists a\nco-final tower of finite sheeted covers {Mj \u2212\u2192 M } with positive rank\ngradient.\nOur construction of the family {Mj } was inspired by the proof of\nTheorem 2.2 of Agol's paper ([Ag]). The proof that this family can be\nmade co-final is given in section 5 (following [Ag]).\nProof of Theorem 3.1. Consider the family of polyhedra {Pj } obtained\nfrom P1 as decribed above. Denote by Gj the reflection group of Pj\nand observe that Gj+1 is a subgroup of Gj of index 2. G1 acts on H3\nwith fundamental domain P1 . The orbifold H3 /G1 is non-orientable,\nand may be viewed as P1 with its faces mirrored. The singular locus is\nthe 2-skeleton of P1 . Each ideal vertex of P1 corresponds to a cusp of\nH3 /G1 .\nLet M1 be an orientable cusped hyperbolic 3-manifold such that\n\u03c01 (M1 ) has finite index in G1 . Let Mj \u2212\u2192 M1 be the cover of M1 whose\nfundamental group is \u03c01 (Mj ) = \u03c01 (M1 ) \u2229 Gj . Since [Gj : Gj+1 ] = 2,\nwe must have [\u03c01 (Mj ) : \u03c01 (Mj+1 )] \u2264 2. Also note that since vol(Pj ) =\n2j\u22121 vol(P1 ), for all but finitely many j (at most [G1 : \u03c01 (M1 )]) we must\nhave [\u03c01 (Mj ) : \u03c01 (Mj+1 )] = 2. We may thus assume that [\u03c01 (Mj ) :\n\u03c01 (Mj+1 )] = 2. By mirroring the faces of Pj , it may be regarded as a\nnon-orientable finite volume orbifold (as described before). This implies\nthat Mj \u2212\u2192 Pj is an orientable finite sheeted cover for j = 1, 2, ....\nNote that [\u03c01 (M1 ) : \u03c01 (Mj )] = 2j\u22121 . Thus to show that the family {Mj \u2212\u2192 M1 } has positive rank gradient we will establish that\nrk(\u03c01 (Mj )) grows with the same magnitude as 2j .\nBy \"half lives half dies\", an easy lower bound on the rank of the\nfundamental group of an orientable finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifold\nis the number of its cusps. Since the cusps of Pj correspond to its ideal\nvertices and the number of cusps does not go down under finite sheeted\ncovers, it must be that Mj has at least as many cusps as the number\nof ideal vertices of Pj .\nRecall that Bj and Wj are the maximal number of ideal vertices on\na black or white face of the polyhedron Pj , respectively, and Vj is the\ntotal number of vertices on Pj . The claims below (proved in section 4)\ngives us the estimates we need for Vj in terms of V1 , B1 and W1 .\nClaim 1. V1 \u2265 B1 + W1 \u2212 1\n\n\f6\n\nDARLAN GIR\u00c3O\n\nClaim 2. For any j \u2265 6,\nVj \u2265 2j\u22121 V1 \u2212 2j\u22121 (B1 + W1 ) + 2j\u22121 + 2j\u22122\nGiven these, we argue as follows:\nrgr(M1 , {Mj }) = lim\n\nj\u2192\u221e\n\nrk(\u03c01 (Mj )) \u2212 1\n\u2265\n[\u03c01 (M1 ) : \u03c01 (Mj )]\n\nVj \u2212 1\n2j\u22121 V1 \u2212 2j\u22121 (B1 + W1 ) + 2j\u22121 + 2j\u22122 \u2212 1\n\u2265\nlim\n\u2265\nj\u2192\u221e 2j\u22121\nj\u2192\u221e\n2j\u22121\nlim\n\n2j\u22121 (B1 + W1 \u2212 1) \u2212 2j\u22121 (B1 + W1 ) + 2j\u22121 + 2j\u22122 \u2212 1\n\u2265\nj\u2192\u221e\n2j\u22121\nlim\n\n1\n2j\u22122 \u2212 1\n=\nj\u22121\nj\u2192\u221e\n2\n2\nwhich proves the theorem.\nlim\n\n\u0003\n\n4. LOWER BOUNDS ON NUMBER OF IDEAL VERTICES\nOF Pj\nWe now proceed to prove Claims 1 and 2. This requires several\npreliminary results.\nLemma 4.1. Let Pj+1 be obtained from Pj by reflection along a face\nfj . Then Vj+1 = 2Vj \u2212 Sfj .\nProof. Here we abuse notation and write v \u2208 fj if v is an ideal vertex\nof the face fj and write v \u2208\n/ fj otherwise. Note that if v \u2208\n/ fj , then\nv yields two vertices on Pj+1 , namely, v and \u03c6fj (v). If v \u2208 fj , then it\nyields a single vertex (v itself).\nIf v \u2208\n/ fj , then, by the observation above, v yields two ideal vertices\non Pj+1 . Since a total of Sfj ideal vertices lie in fj and Vj \u2212 Sfj do not,\nit must be that that\nVj+1 = 2(Vj \u2212 Sfj ) + Sfj = 2Vj \u2212 Sfj\n\u0003\nRecall also that the construction of the family of polyhedra {Pj } is\nmade in an alternating fashion with respect to the color of the faces:\nP2j is obtained from P2j\u22121 by refection along a black face and P2j+1 is\nobtained from P2j by reflection along a white face.\nCorollary 4.2.

P2j is obtained from P2j\u22121 by refection along a black face f2j\u22121 ,\nthus Sf2j\u22121 \u2264 B2j\u22121 . By the lemma, V2j = 2V2j\u22121 \u2212 Sf2j\u22121 and therefore\nV2j \u2265 2V2j\u22121 \u2212 B2j\u22121 . The second inequality is similar.\n\u0003\nWith the notation established above we now find lower bounds for\nthe Vj in terms of V1 , B1 and W1 . First we need to find upper bounds\nfor Bj and Wj in terms of B1 and W1 . To do this in a way that will fit\nour purposes we establish two properties of the family {Pj }. As before,\ndenote by \u03c6fj the reflection along the face fj .\nLemma 4.3.\n(1) If Pj is reflected along a white (resp. black) face\nfj , all black faces f\u2217 (resp. white faces f\u2217 ) adjacent to fj yield\nnew black faces f \u0303\u2217 (resp. white faces f \u0303\u2217 ) on Pj+1 . The number\nSf \u0303\u2217 (resp. Sf \u0303\u2217 ) of ideal vertices on f \u0303\u2217 (resp. f \u0303\u2217 ) is 2Sf\u2217 \u2212 2\n(resp. 2Sf\u2217 \u2212 2).\n(2) A face f\u2217 not adjacent to fj yield two new faces, f\u2217 itself and\n\u03c6f (f\u2217 ), both with Sf\u2217 vertices.\nProof. For the first property, reflecting f\u2217 along fj gives a face \u03c6fj (f\u2217 )\nin Pj+1 adjacent to f\u2217 . The dihedral angle between f\u2217 and \u03c6f (f\u2217 ) is\n\u03c0. Thus, on Pj+1 , they correspond to a single face denoted by f \u0303\u2217 . The\nnumber of ideal vertices on f \u0303\u2217 is exactly 2Sf\u2217 \u2212 2. The second property\nshould be clear.

V1 \u2265 B1 + W1 \u2212 1\nProof. Let fb and fw be black and white faces of P1 with maximal number of vertices, i.e., Sfb = B1 and Sfw = W1 .\nCase 1: The faces fb and fw are not adjacent\nHere we get V1 \u2265 B1 + W1 and the claim follows.\nCase 2: The faces fb and fw are adjacent.\nSince fb and fw share exactly 2 vertices we see that V1 \u2265 B1 +W1 \u22122.\nSuppose we have equality. Then every vertex of P1 must be a vertex of\neither fb or fw . Recall that we can visualize the 1-skeleton of P1 as lying\nin S 2 . Label the vertices of P1 by {v1 , ..., vk }. The assumption is that\nall these vertices lie in the boundary of the disk D = (fb \u222a fw ) \u2282 S 2 . By\nAndreev's theorem, P1 has at least 6 faces, every face is at least 3-sided\nand all vertices are 4-valent. Denoting by F1 and E1 the number of faces\nand edges of P1 respectively we have the relation V1 \u2212 E1 + F1 = 2.\n\n\f10\n\nDARLAN GIR\u00c3O\n\nSince vertices are 4-valent we also have E1 = 2V1 . From these relations\nand F1 \u2265 6, we get V1 \u2265 4. At two of the vertices, say v1 and v2 , three\nof the emanating edges lie in D and one does not. Denote the ones\nthat do not lie in D by e1 and e2 , respectively. At all other vi we have\ntwo edges that lie in D and two that do not. Denote the latter by ei , e0i .\nWe have a total of 2(k \u2212 2) + 2 = 2k \u2212 2 edges not in D. The problem\nwe have now is combinatorial:\nGiven the disk D0 = S 2 \u2212 D and the points v1 , ..., vk \u2208 \u2202D0 , k \u2265 4,\nis it possible to subdivide D0 by 2k \u2212 2 edges in a way that exactly one\nedge emanates from both v1 and v2 and exactly two edges emanate from\nv3 , ..., vk in such a way that no pair of edges intersect and every face\non the subdivision of D0 is at least 3-sided (here we also consider sides\ncoming from the boundary)?\nA simple argument will show that the answer to this question is\nnegative. Orient the boundary of D0 counterclockwise. Starting at\nv1 , draw the edge e1 emanating from it. The other endpoint of e1\nis some vertex vi1 . Consider the vertices contained in the segment\n[v1 , vi1 ] \u2282 \u2202D0 in the given orientation. If there are no vertices at all,\nthen we must have a 2-sided face, which is not possible. Therefore,\nby relabeling, we may assume v2 is the the first vertex between v1 and\nvi1 . Observe that the edges emanating from v2 are trapped between\nthe edge e1 and \u2202D0 . Draw an edge e2 emanating from v2 with the\nsecond endpoint vi2 . It must be that vi2 also lies in [v1 , vi1 ], or else we\nfind a pair of intersecting edges. As above, there must be a vertex in\nthe segment [v2 , vi2 ]. By repeating the above argument eventually we\nfind a 2-sided face, which is not possible. Therefore it must be that\nV1 > B1 + W1 \u2212 2.\n\u0003\n5. CO-FINALNESS\nIn this section we provide a way of choosing the black or white faces\non the polyhedra Pj along which it is reflected in such a way that the\nresulting family {Mj } of manifolds is cofinal. The main result of this\nsection, Theorem 5.1, appears as part of the proof of Theorem 2.2 of\n[Ag]. We include a proof here for completeness. To better describe this\nconstruction we need to change notation slightly by adding another\nindex.\nStart with P1 and relabel it P11 . Reflect along a black face f11\nobtaining P12 . Let \u03c6f11 represent such reflection. Observe that if f is\nadjacent to f11 , then f \u222a \u03c6f11 (f ) corresponds to a single face on P12 .\nWe call f and \u03c6f11 (f ) subfaces of f \u222a \u03c6f11 (f ). Next reflect P12 along\na white face f12 , which is also a face of P11 or contais a face of P11 as\n\n\fRANK GRADIENT IN CO-FINAL TOWERS\n\n11\n\na subface, obtaining P13 . We construct a subcollection P11 , ..., P1k1 of\npolyhedra such that\n(i) If P1j is obtained from P1(j\u22121) by reflection along a white (black)\nface then P1(j+1) is obtained from P1j by reflection along a black\n(white) face.\n(ii) Whenever possible, the face f1j must be a face of P11 or contain\na face of P11 as a subface.\n(iii) No faces of P11 are subfaces of P1k1 .\nNow set P1k1 := P21 . Suppose Pn1 has been constructed. Construct\nthe subcollection of polyhedra Pn1 , ..., Pnkn such that\n(i) The reflections were performed in a alternating fashion with\nrespect to the color of the faces;\n(ii) Whenever possible, the face fnj must be a face of Pn1 or contain\na face of Pn1 as a subface.\n(iii) No faces of Pn1 are subfaces of Pnkn .\nNow set Pnkn := P(n+1)1 . Inductively we obtain a collection of polyhedra\nP11 , P12 , ..., P1k1 := P21 , ..., P2k2 := P31 , ..., Pnkn := P(n+1)1 , ...\nsatisfying (i), (ii) and (iii) above.\nLet Gij be the reflection group of Pij and let Mij be the cover of M11\nwhose fundamental group is \u03c01 (Mij ) = \u03c01 (M11 ) \u2229 Gij . Co-finalness of\nthe family {Mij \u2212\u2192 M11 } is an immediate consequence of\nTheorem 5.1. Let Gij be as above. Then \u2229ij Gij = {1}.\nIn order to prove this theorem we consider the base point for the\nfundamental group of each Pij (viewed as orbifolds with their faces\nmirrored) to be the barycenter x0 of P11 .\nProof of Theorem. Set Rij = inf {`(\u03b3)}, where \u03b3 is an arc with end\u03b3\n\npoints in faces (possibly edges) of Pij going through x0 . Note that,\nby construction, lim Rij = \u221e. For a non-trivial element g \u2208 G11 set\ni\u2192\u221e\n\nRg = inf {`(\u03b1)}, where \u03b1 is a loop in P11 based at x0 and [\u03b1] repre[\u03b1]=g\n\nsents its homotopy class. Let \u03b1g be a loop in P11 based at x0 such that\n[\u03b1g ] = g and `(\u03b1g ) \u2264 Rg + 1.\nWe claim that for sufficiently large i one cannot have g \u2208 Gij . In\nfact, if \u03b1ij is any loop in Pij based at x0 , then this loop bounces off faces\nof Pij , yielding an arc \u03b3ij throught x0 . Therefore `(\u03b1ij ) \u2265 `(\u03b3ij ) \u2265 Rij .\nSince covering maps preserve length of curves, this implies that if i is\nlarge enough no such \u03b1ij maps to \u03b1g . Thus it is not possible to find a\nloop representative for g in Pij .\n\u0003\n\n\f12\n\nDARLAN GIR\u00c3O\n\n6. FINAL REMARKS\nQuestion 3. Is it possible, in our setting, to obtain a co-final tower of\nregular covers {Mj \u2212\u2192 M1 } with positive rank gradient?\nA positive answer to this would be very relevant, as it implies that\nQuestion 2 has a negative answer. However, the tower constructed in\nTheorem 3.1 cannot consist of normal subgroups. To see this we argue\nas follows: using the main theorem in [Ma] we can find a sequence {\u03b3j }\nof hyperbolic elements, \u03b3j \u2208 Gj , whose translation lengths are bounded\nabove by 2.634. Since there exist at most finitely many conjugacy\nclasses of hyperbolic elements of bounded translation length in G1 , it\nmust be that an infinite subsequence {\u03b3jk } lie in the same conjugacy\nclass in G1 . Let \u03b3 be a representative of this class and gjk \u2208 G1 be such\nthat \u03b3jk = gjk \u03b3gj\u22121\n. If the tower {Gj } consists of normal subgroups,\nk\nthen \u03b3 \u2208 Gjk , contradicting the fact that {Gjk } is co-final.\nQuestion 3 is relevant also because of the following result (see [AN]):\nTheorem (Ab\u00e9rt-Nikolov). Either the Rank vs. Heegaard genus conjecture (see below) is false or Question 2 has a negative solution.\nIf an orientable 3-manifold M is closed, a Heegaard splitting of M\nconsists of two handlebodies H1 and H2 with their boundaries identified\nby some orientation preserving homeomorphism. Recall that the genus\nof, say, \u2202H1 gives an upper bound on the rank of \u03c01 (M ). If M is not\nclosed, these decompositions are given in terms of compression bodies,\nagain denoted by H1 and H2 . In order to obtain useful bounds on the\nrank of \u03c01 (M ) we restrict ourselves to those decompositions in which\nH1 , for instance, is a handlebody. Note that if this is the case, then the\ngenus of \u2202H1 is again an upper bound for the rank of \u03c01 (M ). Recall\nthat the Heegaard genus of M is the minimal genus of a Heegaard\nsurface. A long standing question in 3-dimensional topology is:\nConjecture. The rank of an orientable finite volume hyperbolic 3manifold equals its Heegaard genus.\nAnother concept due to Lackenby is that of Heegaard gradient ([La2]).\nGiven a orientable 3-manifold M and a family {Mj } of finite sheeted\ncovers, we define the Heegaard grandient of {Mj \u2212\u2192 M } by\n\u2212\u03c7(Sj )\nj\u2192\u221e\ndj\n\nHgr(M, {Mj }) = lim\n\nwhere dj is the degree of the cover Mj \u2212\u2192 M and Sj is a minimal\ngenus Heegaard surface for Mj .\n\n\fRANK GRADIENT IN CO-FINAL TOWERS\n\n13\n\nNote that if rgr(M, {Mj }) > 0, then Hgr(M, {Mj }) > 0. An important conjecture that would follow from the \"rank versus Heegaard\ngenus\"conjecture is\nConjecture. Let M be a finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifold and {Mi \u2212\u2192\nM } a family of finite sheeted covers. Then rgr(M, {Mi }) > 0 if and\nonly if Hgr(M, {Mi }) > 0\nOur results provide examples for which this is true. In ([La2]) Lackenby showed that if \u03c01 (M ) is an arithmetic lattice in PSL(2,C), then M\nhas a co-final family of covers (namely, those arising from congruence\nsubgroups) with positive Heegaard gradient. In [LLR] Long, Lubotzky\nand Reid generalize this result by proving that every finite volume\nhyperbolic 3-manifold has a co-final family of finite sheeted regular\ncovers for which the Heegaard gradient is positive. These results were\nalso motivation for this note.\nA natural question that arises from our results is to what other categories of finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds they hold. For instance:\nQuestion 4. Is it true that given a right-angled poyhedron P1 (not\nnecessarily ideal) and a manifold M1 such that \u03c01 (M1 ) has finite index\nin the reflection group of P1 , then there exists a co-final tower {Mj \u2212\u2192\nM1 } of finite sheeted covers with positive rank gradient?\nIn our setting the ideal vertices played an important role as they\nwere used to find lower bounds on the rank of the fundamental groups.\nIf the polyhedron P1 has vertices which are not ideal then we need to\nfind another way of estimating the rank of the associated manifolds.\nIan Agol has suggested a way for doing this. We are currently working\non appropriate bounds for the rank in this case and will include it in a\nfuture work.\nIt is also easy to give examples of families {Mj \u2212\u2192 M1 } with arbitrarily large rank gradient. Using the methods above it suffices to\nprovide examples of polyhedra P1 for which the difference V1 \u2212(B1 +W1 )\nis arbitrarily large. Below we illustrate some cases in which this happens: consider the right-angled ideal polyhedron P0 pictured below,\nviewed as lying in S 2 .\nNote that, by Andreev's theorem, this polyhedron can be realized as\na totally geodesic right-angled ideal polyhedron in H3 . Reflecting P0\nalong the white face containing the point at infinity of S 2 will give us\na polyhedron P1 . Since P1 is obtained from two copies of P0 by gluing\ntogether the white faces containing the point at infinity, we have a\nmaximum of 6 ideal vertices per white face of P1 and a maximum of\n4 per black faces. Obviously this construction can be made so that P1\n\n\f14\n\nDARLAN GIR\u00c3O\n\nFigure 2. Polyhedron P0\nhas arbitrarily many ideal vetices.
