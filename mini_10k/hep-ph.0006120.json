Isospin-breaking effects, in particular those associated with electroweakpenguin contributions and \u03c0 0 -\u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 mixing, have long been known to affect the Standard\nModel prediction of \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb in a significant manner. We have found an heretofore unconsidered isospin-violating effect of importance; namely, the u-d quark mass difference\ncan spawn |\u2206I| = 3/2 components in the matrix elements of the gluonic penguin operators. Using chiral perturbation theory and the factorization approximation for the\nhadronic matrix elements, we find within a specific model for the low-energy constants\nthat we can readily accommodate an increase in \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb by a factor of two.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe recent measurement of a non-zero value of Re (\u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb) [1] establishes the existence of CP violation in direct decay and thus provides an important first check\nof the mechanism of CP violation in the Standard Model (SM). Nevertheless, the\nworld average which emerges is Re (\u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb) = (19.3\u00b12.4)*10\u22124 [2], which is larger than\nthe \"central\" SM prediction of 7.0 * 10\u22124 [3,4] by nearly a factor of three. This compels us to scrutinize the SM prediction in further detail: we study isospin-violating\neffects arising from the u-d quark mass difference.\nIsospin violation plays an important role in the analysis of \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb, for the latter is\npredicated by the difference of the imaginary to real part ratios in the |\u2206I| = 1/2\nand |\u2206I| = 3/2 K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 amplitudes. The differing charges of the u and d quarks\nengender |\u2206I| = 3/2 electroweak penguin contributions, whereas \u03c0 0 -\u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 mixing,\ndriven by the u-d quark mass difference, modifies the relative contribution of the\n|\u2206I| = 1/2 and |\u2206I| = 3/2 amplitudes in a significant way.\nHere we describe isospin-breaking effects in the matrix elements of the gluonic\npenguin operators [5], such as Q6 . These operators have always been thought to\n1)\n\nTalk at the 3rd Int. Conf. on Symmetries in Subatomic Physics, Adelaide, Mar. 13-17, 2000\n- based on work performed in collaboration with G.

The difference in the up and down quark masses effectively distinguishes\nthe interaction of gluons with up and down quarks, so that the h\u03c0\u03c0|Q6 |Ki matrix\nelement possesses a |\u2206I| = 3/2 component as well [6].\nLet us begin by showing why the numerical prediction of \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb is sensitive to the\npresence of isospin violation. The value of \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb is inferred from a ratio of ratios,\nnamely\n\u03b5\u2032\n\u01eb\n\nRe\n\n!\n\n\uf8ee\n\n1 \u03b7+\u2212\n= \uf8f0\n6 \u03b700\n\n\uf8f9\n\n2\n\n\u2212 1\uf8fb ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\n\u03b7+\u2212 \u2261\n\nA(KL \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )\nA(KL \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 )\n\u2032\n\u2248\n\u01eb\n+\n\u01eb\n;\n\u03b7\n\u2261\n\u2248 \u01eb \u2212 2\u01eb\u2032 .\n00\n+\n\u2212\n0\n0\nA(KS \u2192 \u03c0 \u03c0 )\nA(KS \u2192 \u03c0 \u03c0 )\n\n(2)\n\nIn the isospin-perfect limit, the two independent amplitudes present in K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\ndecay are distinguished by the isospin of the final-state pions, namely AI \u2261 A(K \u2192\n(\u03c0\u03c0)I ) with I = 0, 2. \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb can thus be written\n\u03c9\n\u01eb\u2032\n= \u2212\u221a\n\u03be(1 \u2212 \u03a9) ,\n\u01eb\n2|\u01eb|\n\n(3)\n\nwith\n\u03c9\u2261\n\nReA2\nRe A0\n\n;\n\n\u03be\u2261\n\nIm A0\nRe A0\n\n;\n\n\u03a9\u2261\n\nIm A2\n.\n\u03c9Im A0\n\n(4)\n\nIn standard practice, \u03c9 \u2248 1/22 and Re A0 are taken from experiment whereas ImAI\nis computed using the operator-product expansion [3,4], that is, via\n10\nX\nGF \u2217\nHeff (|\u2206S| = 1) = 4 \u221a Vus\nCi (\u03bc)Qi (\u03bc) + h.c.\nVud\n2\ni=1\n\n(5)\n\nThe numerical value of \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb is driven by the matrix elements of the QCD penguin operator Q6 and the electroweak penguin operator Q8 [7].

We replace \u03a9\u03b7+\u03b7\u2032 by \u03a9IB , where\n\u03a9IB =\n\n\u0012\u221a \u0013\n\n2 Im(AP (K 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) \u2212 AP (K 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ))\n3\u03c9\nIm AP (K 0 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0)\n\n(7)\n\nand Im AP (K 0 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0) = (Im AP (K 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) + Im AP (K 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ))/2. \"AP \"\ndenotes an amplitude induced by (8L , 1R ) (e.g., Q6 ) operators - the empirical\n|\u2206I| = 1/2 rule suggests such operators dominate the isospin-violating effects.\n\u03a9IB vanishes in the absence of isospin violation, i.e., if mu = md , eu = ed . It can\nbe generated by both strong-interaction and electromagnetic effects, mediated by\nmd 6= mu and eu 6= ed [11], respectively. We focus on md 6= mu effects. The latter include \u03c0 0 -\u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 mixing [12\u201314]; in O(p2 , 1/Nc ) this yields \u03a9\u03b7+\u03b7\u2032 = 0.25 \u00b1 0.05 [13,14],\nused in the analysis of Ref. [3]. However, mu 6= md effects can also spawn a\n|\u2206I| = 3/2 component in the matrix elements of the gluonic penguin operators [6],\nas illustrated in Fig. 1. We turn to a chiral Lagrangian analysis in order to estimate\nthe size of this effect [5].\n\nCHIRAL LAGRANGIAN ANALYSIS\nThe weak chiral Lagrangian for K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 decay is written in terms of the unitary\nmatrix U = exp(i\u03c6/f ) and the function \u03c7, both of which transform as U \u2192 RUL\u2020\nunder the chiral group SU(3)L \u00d7 SU(3)\nR . The function \u03c6 represents the octet of\nP\npseudo-Goldstone bosons, i.e., \u03c6 = a=1,...,8 \u03bba \u03c6a . In the absence of external fields,\n\u03c7 = 2B0 M with M = diag(mu , md , ms ) and B0 \u221d hq\u0304qi. The leading-order, O(p2 ),\nweak chiral Lagrangian contains no mass-dependent terms [15], so that md 6= mu\neffects in the hadronization of the gluonic penguin operators first appear in O(p4 ).\nThis is illustrated in Fig. 2.\n\nW\n\ns\n\n-\n\nd\nq\n\nu,c,t\ng\nq\nFIGURE 1.

This\nserves as our focus here, for it contains the qualitatively new effects we argue.\n\nWe use the octet terms in the O(p4 ), CP-odd weak chiral Lagrangian of Ref. [16].\nCollecting the \u03c7-dependent terms as per iv), working to O(md \u2212 mu ), and dropping\nterms suppressed by M\u03c02 /MK2 , we find\n\u221a\nB0 (md \u2212 mu ) \u2212 0.12GeV2 \u2212\nMK2 0\n2 2\n\u1ebc \u2248\n\u1ebc\n(8)\n\u03a9P =\n3\u03c9 MK2 0 \u2212 M\u03c02\nc\u2212\nc\u2212\n2\n2\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\nwith \u1ebc \u2212 = 2E1\u2212 \u22122E3\u2212 \u22124E4\u2212 \u2212E10\n\u2212E11\n\u22124E12\n\u2212E15\n.

As per\nii), \u03c0 0 -\u03b7 mixing in O(p2 ) also enters when combined with the isospin-conserving\nvertices of the O(p4 ) weak chiral Lagrangian.

Mass\neffects do not occur in the weak transition in leading order in chiral perturbation theory, so that\nonly the left-hand diagram occurs in O(p2 ) and in O(md \u2212 mu ) - \u03c0 0 -\u03b7 mixing, mediated by\nmd \u2212 mu effects in the strong chiral Lagrangian, can occur.

(8) occurs.\nThe low-energy constants Ei\u2212 are unknown, so that we turn to the factorization\napproximation to proceed. The construction relevant to (8L , 1R ) transitions in\nK 0 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 decay is [17]\n\nLP = \u2212\n\nG\n\u221aF V \u22c6 Vud\n2 us\n\n\u2192\n\nG\n\u221aF V \u22c6 Vud\n2 us\n\n\u0012\n\nC6 \u22128(s\u0304L qR )(q\u0304R dL )\n\n\u0013\n\n+ h.c.\n\n(10)\n\nstr \u03b4Lstr\nC6 32B02 \u03b4L\n+ h.c. ,\n\u03b4\u03c7\u2020 \u03b4\u03c7i2\n\n(11)\n\n3i\n\nwhere Lstr is the strong chiral Lagrangian. To generate terms of O(p4 ) in LP\nrequires terms of both O(p4 ) [18] and O(p6 ) [19] in Lstr . Unfortunately, the lowenergy constants of the latter are also unknown; the use of \"resonance saturation\"\nallows us to estimate some of them. We explicitly consider the scalar nonet of resonances as per Ref. [20]. An example of the manner in which the scalar resonances\ncan generate contributions to the Ei\u2212 is illustrated in Fig. 3. Integrating out the\nscalar resonances for p2 \u226a MS2 , we find two terms which contribute to the scalar\ndensities in the bosonization of Q6 [20],\n(6)\n\nLS =\n\ndm c2m 3\ncd cm d m 2 2\nh\u03c7+ i +\nh\u03c7+ L i ,\n4\n2MS\nMS4\n\n(12)\n\n\u2212\nyielding contributions to E1\u2212 and E10\nin terms of dm , cm , cd , and MS . The parameter dm is ill-known; we find dm \u223c \u22122.4 (\u22120.76). The sign of dm and thus\nof \u03a9P in our model results from the mass of the lowest-lying strange scalar being\ngreater than that of the lowest-lying isovector scalar. As per our earlier classifica(4)\n(4),i\n(4),ii\n(4),iii\n(4),iv\ntion, \u03a9IB = \u03a9IB + \u03a9IB + \u03a9IB + \u03a9IB , so that with dm = \u22122.4 (\u22120.76), we\n\n\u03c0\n\nK\n\na0\ncm\n\nf0\ndm\n\ncm\n\n\u03c0\nFIGURE 3. A contribution to the right-hand diagram of Fig. 2 in O(md \u2212 mu ), estimated\nin the factorization approximation with explicit, scalar-resonance degrees of freedom. The \"\u2297\"\nrepresents a bosonized current; the open parentheses denote contributions from the vertices of\nthe O(p6 ) model Lagrangian of Ref. [20]. In this case the isospin-violating contribution is driven\nby a0 -f0 mixing.\n\n\f(4),iv\n\n(4) ,ii\n\nhave \u03a9IB = \u22120.79 (\u22120.21). Estimating \u03a9IB using the \u03c7-dependent Ei\u2212 yields\n(4),ii\n(4),iii\n\u03a9IB = \u22120.12 (\u22120.03). \u03a9IB has been partially determined through the inclusion\n(2)\n(4),iii\n=\nof \u03c0 0 -\u03b7 \u2032 mixing in \u03a9\u03b7+\u03b7\u2032 = 0.25 \u00b1 0.05 [13,14]. Using the result \u03a9IB + \u03a9IB\n(4),i\n\u2212\n0.16 \u00b1 0.03 [21] and neglecting \u03a9IB , as the ill-known Ei do not warrant such a\n(4)\n(2)\ncalculation, we estimate, finally, that \u03a9IB = \u03a9IB + \u03a9IB \u223c \u22120.05 \u2192 \u22120.78. For\n(2)\n(4)\nreference, note that \u03a9IB \u223c 0.13. The large value of \u03a9IB is driven by the numerical\n(4)\nprefactor of Eqs. (8,9) - the contributions in \u03a9IB are \"naturally\" of the same size as\n(2)\n\u03a9IB . Thus we find a very large correction to the value of \u03a9\u03b7+\u03b7\u2032 = 0.25\u00b10.05, used in\n\"central value\" of \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb . The large negative change in \u03a9IB found in O(p4 ) generates\na substantial increase in \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb .\nThe \u03a9IB we calculate impacts \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb in a significant manner. Our estimate of \u03a9IB\nfrom the specific md 6= mu effects we consider ranges from \u22120.05 \u2192 \u22120.78; this\nrange exceeds the central value, \u03a9\u03b7+\u03b7\u2032 = 0.25 \u00b1 0.05, used in earlier analyses and\nreflects a variation in \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb of more than a factor of two. The presence of unknown\nlow-energy constants implies that we lack a reliable way to calculate the effects we\nconsider. Such limitations, however, underscore the need for a larger uncertainty\nin the Standard Model prediction of \u01eb\u2032 /\u01eb .\nThe collaboration of G. Valencia is gratefully acknowledged.
