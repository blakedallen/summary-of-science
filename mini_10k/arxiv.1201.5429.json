Since each cell of a cellular automaton takes only a finite\nnumber of states, it seems natural to describe its time evolution by utilising a finite field. In\nparticular, if we can construct finite field analogues of dynamical equations whose mathematical structures are well studied, such as integrable systems, this construction may give some\nfundamental methods for analysing models of cellular automata. Discrete analogues of integrable\nequations have been widely investigated, however, their extension over a finite field has less been\nexamined. One of the reasons for this may be that the time evolution of a nonlinear system\nis not always well defined over a finite field. For example, let us consider the discrete KdV\nequation\n1\nxt+1\nn+1\n\n\u2212\n\n\u0001\n\u03b4\n1\nt\n+\nxt+1\nn \u2212 xn+1 = 0,\nt\nxn 1 + \u03b4\n\n(1.1)\n\nover a finite field Fq where q = pm , p is a prime number and m \u2208 Z+ . Here n, t \u2208 Z and \u03b4 is\na parameter. If we put\n1\n1\n:= (1 + \u03b4) t+1 \u2212 \u03b4xtn\nt\nyn\nxn\nwe obtain equivalent coupled equations\nxt+1\n=\nn\n\n(1 + \u03b4)ynt\n,\n1 + \u03b4xtn ynt\n\nt\nyn+1\n=\n\n(1 + \u03b4xtn ynt )xtn\n.\n1+\u03b4\n\n(1.2)\n\nClearly (1.2) does not determine the time evolution when 1 + \u03b4xtn ynt \u2261 0. Over a field of\ncharacteristic 0 such as C, the time evolution of (xtn , ynt ) will not hit this exceptional line for\n\n\f2\n\nM. Kanki, J. Mada and T. Tokihiro\n\ngeneric initial conditions, but on the contrary, the evolution comes to this exceptional line in\nmany cases over a finite field as a division by 0 appears.\nA pioneering work on integrable equations over finite fields is that by Doliwa, Bialecki and\nKlimczewski [1, 4]. They used an algebro-geometric approach to construct soliton solutions to\ndiscrete integrable equations over finite fields in Hirota's bilinear form. For the discrete KdV\nequation, the bilinear form is written as\nt+1 t\u22121\nt\u22121 t\u22121\nt\n(1 + \u03b4)\u03c3n+1\n\u03c3n = \u03b4\u03c3n+1\n\u03c3n + \u03c3nt \u03c3n+1\n.\n\n(1.3)\n\nThe N -soliton solution to the equation (1.3) is given as\n\u0012\n\u0013t \u0012\n\u0013n !\n\u03b3\n1\n\u2212\nl\nl\n+\n\u03b4\ni\ni\ni\n\u03c3nt = det\n\u03b4ij +\n1\u2264i,j\u2264N\nli + lj \u2212 1\nli\n1 + \u03b4 \u2212 li\n\n(1.4)\n\nwhere \u03b3i , li (i = 1, 2, . . . , N ) are arbitrary parameters satisfying li 6= lj for i 6= j. Hence\nif we choose li 6\u2261 0, 1 + \u03b4 (i = 1, 2, . . . , N ) and li + lj 6\u2261 1 (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 N ), the N soliton\nsolution (1.4) is well defined for all (n, t) \u2208 Z2 and gives a time evolution pattern over a finite\nfield. A similar approach was also used for discrete KP equation in the bilinear form [2].\nHowever, since the nonlinear form of the discrete KdV equation (1.1) is obtained from (1.3) by\nputting xtn :=\n\nt \u03c3 t\u22121\n\u03c3n\nn+1\n\n, well defined N -soliton solutions xtn of (1.1) or (1.2) cannot be obtained\n\nt\u22121\nt\n\u03c3n+1\n\u03c3n\nbecause xtn is\n\nt\nfrom (1.4)\nnot defined if \u03c3n+1\n\u2261 0 or \u03c3nt\u22121 \u2261 0. Indeterminacy of the time evolution\nfor a generic initial state cannot be avoided either when we use Hirota's bilinear form. Note\nthat if we consider the equation over PFq := Fq \u222a {\u221e} instead of Fq by adding a value \u221e, we\nfrequently hit the indeterminate values 00 , \u221e + 0, 0 * \u221e and so on, which causes further problems.\nIn this article, we propose a prescription to determine the time evolution of a nonlinear system\nover finite fields by taking as examples the discrete KdV equation (1.1) and its generalization.\nWe show in Section 2 that the initial value problem is well defined and we investigate N -soliton\nsolutions in Section 3. The last section is devoted to discussing the relation of our method to\nthe singularity confinement method [5].\n\n2\n2.1\n\nA generalized discrete KdV equation over a function f ield\nDiscrete KdV equation\n\nFirst we explain how the indeterminate values appear through the time evolution by examining\nthe discrete KdV equation (1.2) over F7 := {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. If we take \u03b4 = 1, (1.2) turns into\nxt+1\n=\nn\n\n2ynt\n,\n1 + xtn ynt\n\nt\nyn+1\n=\n\n(1 + xtn ynt )xtn\n.\n2\n\nSuppose that x01 = 6, x02 = 5, y10 = 2, y11 = 2, then we have\n4\n78\n\u2261 3,\ny20 =\n\u22614\n13\n2\nWith further calculation we have\n4\n4\n21\nx21 = \u2261 ,\ny21 =\n\u2261 0,\n7\n0\n2\nx11 =\n\nmod 7.\n\nx12 =\n\n8\n1\n\u2261 .\n21\n0\n\nSince 40 and 10 are not defined over F7 , we now extend F7 to PF7 and take\n{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.

Elements\nof PF7 are represented on the following grayscale: from 0 (white) to 6 (gray) and \u221e (black). See the\nscale bar in the figure.\n\nTherefore we try the following two procedures: [I] we keep \u03b4 as a parameter for the same\ninitial condition, and obtain as a system over F7 (\u03b4),\n2(1 + \u03b4)\n6(1 + 5\u03b4)\n6(1 + \u03b4)(1 + 5\u03b4)\n2(1 + 2\u03b4 + 4\u03b4 2 )\n1\n, y20 =\n,\nx12 =\n,\ny\n=\n,\n2\n1 + 5\u03b4\n1+\u03b4\n1 + 3\u03b4 + 3\u03b4 2\n(1 + 5\u03b4)2\n2(1 + \u03b4)(1 + 5\u03b4)\n4(1 + \u03b4)(2 + \u03b4)(3 + 2\u03b4)\n2(5 + 5\u03b4 + 2\u03b4 2 )\n2\n1\nx21 =\n,\nx\n=\n,\ny\n=\n.\n3\n2\n1 + 2\u03b4 + 4\u03b4 2\n(1 + 5\u03b4)(5 + 5\u03b4 + 2\u03b4 2 )\n(2 + \u03b4)2\nx11 =\n\n[II] Then we put \u03b4 = 1 to have a system over PF7 as\nx11 = 3,\nx22 =\n\ny20 = 4,\n\n120\n\u2261 4,\n72\n\ny31 =\n\nx12 =\n\n72\n\u2261 \u221e,\n7\n\ny21 =\n\n14\n\u2261 0,\n36\n\nx21 =\n\n24\n\u2261 \u221e,\n7\n\n24\n\u2261 5.\n9\n\nThus all the values are uniquely determined over PF7 . Figs. 1 and 2 show a time evolution\npattern of the discrete KdV equation (1.2) over PF7 for the initial conditions x01 = 6, x02 = 5,\nx03 = 4, x04 = 3, x0j = 2 (j \u2265 5) and y1t = 2 (t \u2265 0).\nThis example suggests that the equation (1.2) should be understood as evolving over the\nfield Fq (\u03b4), the rational function field with indeterminate \u03b4 over Fq . To obtain the time evolution\npattern over PFq , we have to substitute \u03b4 with a suitable value \u03b40 \u2208 Fq (\u03b40 = 1 in the example\n\n\f4\n\nM. Kanki, J. Mada and T. Tokihiro\n\nabove). This substitution can be expressed as the following reduction map:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n0,\ns > 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\ng(\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b40 )\ns < 0,\nFq (\u03b4)\u00d7 \u2192 PFq : (\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b40 )s\n7\u2192 \u221e,\n\uf8f4\nf (\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b40 )\ng(0)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n, s = 0,\n\uf8f3\nf (0)\nwhere s \u2208 Z, f (h), g(h) \u2208 Fq [h] are co-prime polynomials and f (0) 6= 0, g(0) 6= 0. With\nthis prescription, we know that 0/0 does not appear and we can uniquely determine the time\nevolution for generic initial conditions defined over Fq .\n\n2.2\n\nGeneralized discrete KdV equation\n\nIn this subsection we explain how to apply our method to a dynamical system with more than\none parameters by taking a generalized form of the discrete KdV equation as an example. In\nthis case, we have to be careful in substituting the values to the parameters. The generalised\ndiscrete KdV equation is the following discrete integrable system:\n\b\n\b\n(1 \u2212 \u03b2) + \u03b2xtn ynt ynt\n(1 \u2212 \u03b1) + \u03b1xtn ynt xtn\nt+1\nt\nxn =\n,\ny\n=\n,\n(2.1)\nn+1\n(1 \u2212 \u03b1) + \u03b1xtn ynt\n(1 \u2212 \u03b2) + \u03b2xtn ynt\nwith arbitrary parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2. To avoid indeterminacy, we regard (2.1) as a dynamical\nsystem over Fq (\u03b1, \u03b2). Then, as in the case of (1.2), its time evolution is uniquely determined\nfor generic initial and boundary conditions. Note that when we substitute values in Fq for the\nparameters, the result can be indeterminate, i.e., 00 , or it can depend on the order of the substitutions. These problems are typical of a field of rational functions with two or more parameters.\nEven if the numerator and the denominator of a rational function are both irreducible polynomials without common factors, there will be points of indeterminacy, since the numerator and\nthe denominator intersect in co-dimension two or more in the space of parameters. For example,\nlet q = 5 and suppose that xtn = ynt = 2 \u2208 F5 then\nxt+1\n=\nn\n\n2+\u03b2\n\u2208 F5 (\u03b1, \u03b2).\n1 + 3\u03b1\n\nIf we put \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 3 \u2208 F5 , then, we find that\n0\nxt+1\n= ,\nn\n0\nor, if we first substitute \u03b2, then\nxt+1\n=\nn\n\n0\n\u2261 0,\n1 + 3\u03b1\n\nwhich is unrelated to subsequent substitutions of \u03b1.\nOne remedy is to regard these parameters themselves as depending on a common parameter.\nFor example, if we put \u03b1 = 3 + \u000f and \u03b2 = 3 + \u000f,\nxt+1\n=\nn\n\n2 + (3 + \u000f)\n\u000f\n1\n\u2261\n= \u2261 2,\n1 + 3(3 + \u000f)\n3\u000f\n3\n\nand the value is uniquely determined in PF5 . We show an example of a time evolution pattern\nof (2.1) thus determined in Fig. 3. The preceding arguments suggest a general trick to construct\nan equation, or a time evolution rule, over a finite field from a given discrete equation.\n\n\fDiscrete Integrable Equations over Finite Fields\n\u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003\n\n5\n\n\u074a\n\n\u202b\u0003\u0750\u202c\nFigure 3.

Introduce one parameter, say \u000f, in the equation (or the initial condition), and obtain\na solution over Fq (\u000f).\n2. Substitute a value in Fq for the parameter in the solution, and obtain a pattern over PFq .\nThis construction can be applied to both ordinary and partial difference equations regardless of\ntheir integrability. If we have explicit form of a solution with this parameter, we immediately\nobtain a pattern over a finite field by replacing the parameter with a value in the field. In the\nnext section, we show some example of soliton solutions of (1.2) and (2.1) over finite fields.\n\n3\n\nSoliton solutions over f inite f ields\n\nFirst we consider the N -soliton solutions to (1.1) over Fq .

When li , \u03b3i\nare chosen in Fq , xtn becomes a rational function in Fq (\u03b4). Hence we obtain soliton solutions\nover PFq by substituting \u03b4 with a value in Fq . Figs. 4 and 5 show one and two soliton solutions\nfor the discrete KdV equation (1.1) over the finite fields PF11 and PF19 . The corresponding\ntime evolutionary patterns on the field R are also presented for comparison.\nNext we consider soliton solutions to the generalized discrete KdV equation (2.1). Note that\nby putting utn := \u03b1xtn , vnt := \u03b2ynt , we obtain\nut+1\n=\nn\n\n(\u03b1(1 \u2212 \u03b2) + utn vnt )vnt\n,\n\u03b2(1 \u2212 \u03b1) + utn vnt\n\nt\nvn+1\n=\n\n(\u03b2(1 \u2212 \u03b1) + utn vnt )utn\n.\n\u03b1(1 \u2212 \u03b2) + utn vnt\n\nHence (2.1) is essentially equivalent to the 'consistency of the discrete potential KdV equation\naround a 3-cube' [12]: (u, v) \u2192 (u0 , v 0 ), as\nu0 = vP,\n\nv 0 = uP \u22121 ,\n\nP =\n\na + uv\n.\nb + uv\n\nThe map is also obtained from discrete BKP equation [6]. We will obtain N -soliton solutions\nto (2.1) from the N -soliton solutions to the discrete KP equation by a reduction similar to the\none adopted in [6].\n\n\f6\n\nM. Kanki, J. Mada and T.

By substituting \u03b1 = na + \u000f, \u03b2 = nb + \u000f\n(na , nb \u2208 Fq ), we can construct soliton solutions in Fq (\u000f) for suitable values of {pi , \u03b3i } and \u2206.\nWe denote the solutions defined in PFq when we put \u000f = 0 as f \u0303, g\u0303, x\u0303tn and \u1ef9nt . Figs. 6 and 7\nshow x\u0303tn for one and two soliton solutions for the generalized discrete KdV equation (2.1).\nLastly, we discuss the periodicity of the soliton solutions over PFq . We have\nf \u0303(n + q \u2212 1, t) = f \u0303(n, t + q \u2212 1) = f \u0303(n, t),\n\ng\u0303(n + q \u2212 1, t) = g\u0303(n, t + q \u2212 1) = g\u0303(n, t),\n\n \u0303\nfor all t, n \u2208 Z since we have aq\u22121 \u2261 1 for all a \u2208 F\u00d7\nq . Thus the functions f and g\u0303 have periods\nt\nt\nq \u2212 1 over Fq . However we cannot conclude that x\u0303n and \u1ef9n are also periodic with periods q \u2212 1.\nThe values of x\u0303tn may not be periodic when f \u0303(n, t)g\u0303(n + 1, t) = 0 and g\u0303(n, t)f \u0303(n + 1, t) = 0\n(see (3.5)).

It is important to determine how\nto reduce values in PFq (\u000f) to values in PFq , depending on the properties one wishes the soliton\nsolutions to possess.\n\n4\n\nDiscussion and concluding remarks\n\nWe presented a prescription to obtain dynamical equations over finite fields from discrete equations defined over a field with characteristic 0. The essential trick is to introduce an indeterminate (a parameter \u000f) and regard the equations defined over Fq (\u000f). By substituting \u000f with a value\nin Fq , we can uniquely determine the values of the dependent variables in PFq . Furthermore if\nwe have a one-parameter family of solutions to the original equation, we obtain the solution over\na finite field straight away by substituting a suitable value for the parameter. The N -soliton\nsolutions to the discrete KdV equation and the generalized discrete KdV equations over finite\nfields are thus obtained.\nOur approach is also applied not only to the other discrete soliton equations but to ordinary\nnonlinear difference equations such as discrete Painlev\u00e9 equations. Let us consider dP2 equation [7, 13]:\nxn+1 + xn\u22121 =\n\nzn x n + a\n,\nx2n \u2212 1\n\nn \u2208 Z,\n\n(4.1)\n\n\f10\n\nM. Kanki, J. Mada and T. Tokihiro\n\nwhere zn := n\u03b4 and a, \u03b4 are constants. If we examine (4.1) over Fq , we cannot define its time\nevolution after the dependent variable xn takes \u00b11. However, by regarding a as an indeterminate,\nwe can define the time evolution over Fq (a) and obtain a value in PFq by substituting a value\nin Fq for a. The effectiveness of this approach is confirmed for wide range of ordinary discrete\nequations such as the other discrete or q-discrete Painlev\u00e9 equations and the QRT mappings [16].\nThere is, however, another choice of indeterminate for the discrete ordinary difference equations. Let (x0 , x1 ) = (y, x) with y \u2208 Fq in (4.1). Then xk (k = 2, 3, . . . ) can be regarded as\na function of x, i.e. xk \u2208 Fq (x). Since we have\nz1 + a\n(z1 \u2212 a)\n+\n+ O(x \u2212 1),\n2(x \u2212 1)\n4\nx3 = \u22121 + O(x \u2212 1),\ny(z1 + a) + 2a + \u03b4z2\nx4 =\n+ O(x \u2212 1),\na \u2212 z3\n************ ,\nx2 =\n\nwe can determine x3 , x4 , . . . by putting x \u2192 1 despite the fact that they are not well defined if\nwe take x1 = 1 in advance. The time evolution pattern thus obtained coincides with that of our\napproach with an indeterminate a.\nThe above procedure reminds us the singularity confinement method which is an effective\ntest to judge the integrability of the given equations [5]. In fact, if we consider (4.1) over C and\ntake \u000f := x\u22121 as an infinitesimal parameter, the time evolution pattern is exactly the one which\npasses the singularity confinement test. The grounds of this similarity become clear when one\nthinks of the theory of the space of initial conditions of the Painlev\u00e9 equations [8, 9, 10, 11, 15].\nAs observed by Sakai [15], passing the singularity confinement test is essentially equivalent\nto the fact that the equation is lifted to an automorphism of the rational surface (the space of\ninitial conditions) obtained by compactification and blowing-up from the original space of initial\nvalues C \u00d7 C. By introducing infinitesimal parameter in the case of singularity confinement\ntest or an indeterminate in our approach, we avoid passing through a point on an exceptional\ncurve generated by blowing-up and approximate the automorphism in an effective way. Hence\nthese three types of approaches, that is, construction of space of initial conditions, application\nof singularity confinement and the method shown in the present paper, give the same time\nevolution rule for the discrete Painelev\u00e9 equations over finite fields.\nFor soliton equations, however, we have difficulty in defining time evolution by constructing\nthe space of initial conditions. Let us return to the equation (2.1). The mapping, (xtn , ynt ) 7\u2192\nt\n1\n1\n(xt+1\nn , yn+1 ), is lifted to an automorphism of the surface X\u0303, where X\u0303 is obtained from P \u00d7 P\nby blowing up twice at (0, \u221e) and (\u221e, 0) respectively:\nX\u0303 = A1 \u222a A2 ,\n\u001a\u0012\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n1\n1\nA1 :=\nx,\n, [\u03be : \u03b7], [u : v]\nx\u03b7 \u2212 \u03be = 0,\ny\ny\n\u001b\nx ((1 \u2212 \u03b1)\u03b7 + \u03b1\u03be) v \u2212 ((1 \u2212 \u03b2)\u03b7 + \u03b2\u03be) u = 0 \u2282 A2 \u00d7 P1 \u00d7 P1 ,\n\u001a\u0012\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n1\n1\nA2 :=\n, y , [\u03be : \u03b7], [w : z]\n\u03be \u2212 y\u03b7 = 0,\nx\nx\n\u001b\ny ((1 \u2212 \u03b2)\u03b7 + \u03b2\u03be) w \u2212 ((1 \u2212 \u03b1)\u03b7 + \u03b1\u03be) z = 0 \u2282 A2 \u00d7 P1 \u00d7 P1 ,\nwhere [a : b] denotes a set of homogeneous coordinates for P1 . But, to define the time evolution\n\n\fDiscrete Integrable Equations over Finite Fields\n\n11\n\nof the system with N lattice points from (2.1), we have to consider the mapping\n\u0001\nt+1\nt+1 t\n(y1t ; xt1 , xt2 , . . . , xtN ) 7\u2212\u2192 xt+1\n1 , x2 , . . . , xN ; yN +1 .\nSince there seems no reasonable decomposition of X\u0303 into a direct product of two independent\nspaces, successive use of (2.1) becomes impossible. Note that if we blow down X\u0303 to P1 \u00d7 P1 , the\ninformation of the initial values is lost in general. If we intend to construct an automorphism\nof a space of initial conditions, it will be inevitable to start from PN +1 and blow-up to some\nhuge manifold, which is beyond the scope of the present paper. This difficulty seems to be one\nof the reasons why the singularity confinement method has not been used for construction of\nintegrable partial difference equations or judgement for their integrability, though some attempts\nhave been proposed in the bilinear form [14]. There should be so many exceptional hyperplanes\nin the space of initial conditions if it does exist, and it is practically impossible to check all the\n\"singular\" patterns in the na\u0131\u0308ve extension of the singularity confinement test. On the other\nhand, when we fix the initial condition for a partial difference equation, the number of singular\npatterns is restricted in general and we have only to enlarge the domain so that the mapping\nbecomes well defined. This is the strategy that we adopted in this article.\nAs shown in the above discussion, the discrete Painlev\u00e9 equations over finite fields can be\ntreated by several methods. The comparison of the mathematical structure in C with that\nin Fq is one of the future problems. Clarifying the geometric and/or algebraic meaning of our\napproach to soliton equations and applications of our approach to the initial value problems\nrelated to curves over finite fields are also the problems we shall address in the future.\n\nAcknowledgement\nThe authors wish to thank Professors K.M.
