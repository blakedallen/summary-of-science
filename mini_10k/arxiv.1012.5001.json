In the macroscopic theory, the motion of a particle\nthrough a medium (or near a medium) with sharp boundaries leads to various types of polarization radiation: Cherenkov radiation (in the absence of boundaries), transition radiation\n(the particle intersects the interface between two media), diffraction radiation (the particles\n\u2217\n\ne-mail: d.karlovets@gmail.com. This manuscript deals with problems some of which were treated before\nin the preprint arXiv:0908.2336v2. However, results obtained there, strictly speaking, are not applicable for\ntransparent media (\u03b5\u2032\u2032 = 0) because the multiple reflections of radiation inside the medium were not taken\ninto account. In the present paper, this defect has been corrected.\n\n1\n\n\fmoves near the interface), etc. The number of exact solutions to the problem of polarization\nradiation for media with sharp boundaries is not large. The most important of the exactly\nsolvable problems are the calculations of transition radiation in a slab of a finite permittivity [2] and diffraction radiation from a perfectly conducting semi-plane [3,4] and wedge [5,6].\nThe solution of such problems in more complex geometries is complicated by difficulties in\nthe formulation of the boundary conditions. It is well known, for example, that rigorous solution of the problem of radiation from a charge moving near a perfectly conducting grating\n(so-called Smith-Purcell radiation) is expressed by infinite series and leads to a system of\nan infinitely large number of equations [7, 8]. However, surfaces with intricate profiles are\nmost interesting for applications. For this reason, the development of approximate methods\nin the problems of polarization radiation is topical.\nIn this paper, an approach is developed in which polarization radiation is represented\nas the field of the current induced in a substance by the field of a point charge moving\nuniformly in vacuum. The advantage of this method lies in the possibility of determining\nthe characteristics of various types of polarization radiation (including the case when several\ntypes of radiation are generated simultaneously) for a wide range of surfaces taking into\naccount actual dielectric properties of the substance and frequency dispersion. It will be\nshown that, in some special cases, the results obtained using the method developed here\nare transformed into familiar expressions for Cherenkov radiation, transition radiation, and\ndiffraction radiation (as well as parametric X-ray radiation; see [9]).\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the method of induced currents is\ndescribed and the radiation field generated during the motion of a charge along the axis of\na cylindrical vacuum channel in a screen with finite permittivity \u03b5(\u03c9) = \u03b5\u2032 + i\u03b5\u2032\u2032 , thickness,\nand radius is described. Then, the emergence of radiation from the substance into vacuum is\nconsidered, and the energy emitted into vacuum in the \"forward\" and \"backward\" directions\nis determined using the well-known reciprocity theorem. In Section 3, the solution to the\nproblem of radiation generated when a particle moves near a rectangular screen of finite\nsizes and permittivity is obtained. In contrast to the known solution, possible multiple\nre-reflections of the radiation field in the screen are taken into account. In Section 4, the\nsolution to the problem of radiation generated by a particle moving in the vicinity of a thin\ngrating consisting of rectangular strips and possessing a finite permittivity is obtained. The\nresults, including the limits of their applicability, are discussed in Section 5.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nPolarization Radiation Generated in a Cylindrical Channel in\na Screen of a Finite Thickness and Radius\nRadiation inside a Screen with a Finite Permittivity\n\nLet us consider a homogeneous isotropic non-magnetic medium with a complex conductivity and a frequency dispersion:\ni\u03c9\n(1 \u2212 \u03b5(\u03c9)).\n(1)\n4\u03c0\np\nA charged particle possessing an energy \u03b3 = E/mc2 = 1/ 1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 , and moving at a constant\nvelocity v = \u03b2c in the substance induces in it a polarization currents of density:\n\u03c3(\u03c9) =\n\njpol = \u03c3(E0 + Epol (jpol )),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere E0 \u2261 E0 (r, \u03c9), Epol \u2261 Epol (r, \u03c9) are the Fourier transforms of the field of the particle\nin vacuum and of the field of currents induced in the substance.\n2\n\n\fTo determine the field of polarization radiation propagating in the substance in the form\nof transverse waves, we must solve the \"vacuum\" Maxwell equations with current density jpol\non the right-hand side. However, Eq.(2) for the current density is an integral equation. The\nintegral term can be disregarded if the conductivity of the medium is low, |\u03b5 \u2212 1| \u226a 1, which\nmakes it possible to obtain the required solutions in the X-ray part of the spectrum [9\u201313].\nIn the general case, when parameter |\u03b5 \u2212 1| is not small, the field acting on each atom and\nmolecule does not coincide with vacuum field E0 any longer. However, in this case also we can\nproceed in the same way as in deriving the macroscopic Maxwell equations. Transferring the\nintegral term \u03c3Epol to the left-hand side of these equations, we obtain the following equation\nfor the magnetic field:\n\u0010\n\u03c92 \u0011\n4\u03c0\n\u2206 + \u03b5(\u03c9) 2 Hpol (r, \u03c9) = \u2212 \u03c3(\u03c9)rotE0 (r, \u03c9).\n(3)\nc\nc\nThe solution to this equation in the wave zone gives the field of polarization radiation\nemitted by atoms and molecules of the substance as a result of so-called distant collisions,\nin which the energy lost by a particle is negligibly low as compared to its total energy. It\nwill be shown below that in an unbounded medium this solution coincides with the field of\nCherenkov radiation.\nIf the polarization currents are induced in a limited volume of the substance (i.e., the\nmedium has boundaries), the integration in the solution of (3) is performed only over the\ndomain VT occupied by the currents:\n\u221a\nZ\ni \u03b5(\u03c9)\u03c9|r\u2212r\u2032 |/c\n1\ne\nHpol (r, \u03c9) = rot\n\u03c3(\u03c9)E0(r\u2032 , \u03c9)\nd3 r \u2032 .\n(4)\nc\n|r \u2212 r\u2032 |\nVT\n\nIn a bounded volume of the substance, the waves reflected from the boundaries, which cannot\nbe described by expression (4), also exist apart from polarization radiation waves. However,\nsuch waves can be taken into account at a later stage when the emergence of radiation from\nthe medium into vacuum will be considered. Evaluating the curl in Eq.(4) we obtain\nZ\n\u0011 ei\u221a\u03b5\u03c9|r\u2212r\u2032|/c\n\u0010\u221a \u03c9\n\u2032\n1\n1\nr\n\u2212\nr\nHpol (r, \u03c9) =\n\u00d7 \u03c3(\u03c9)E0 (r\u2032 , \u03c9) i \u03b5 \u2212\nd3 r \u2032\n(5)\nc\n|r \u2212 r\u2032 |\nc\n|r \u2212 r\u2032 |\n|r \u2212 r\u2032 |\nVT\n\n(here and below dependence of \u03b5 on frequency is implied).\nIt can be seen from this expression that the wave zone of radiation is defined by the\nfollowing inequalities:\np\n\u2032\n(6)\nr \u226b \u03bb/ \u03b5(\u03c9), r \u226b ref\nf,\n\n\u2032\nwhere ref\nf determines the effective region in the substance, occupied by currents and making\nthe main contribution to integral (5). It should be noted that the first of the conditions of\nthe wave zone cannot be satisfied near permittivity zeros (\u03b5(\u03c9) \u2192 0). This corresponds\nto the well-known fact that there are no transverse waves propagating in the substance to\ninfinity at resonant frequencies [14]. When conditions (6) are satisfied, the expression for\nthe field of induced currents describes the transverse radiation field in the substance:\n\u221a\nZ\n\u221a i\u03c9 eir \u03b5\u03c9/c\n\u2032\npol\nR\nH \u2248H = \u03b5 2\ne \u00d7 \u03c3(\u03c9)E0(r\u2032 , \u03c9)e\u2212ikr d3 r \u2032 ,\n(7)\nc\nr\nVT\n\n\u221a\n\nwhere k = \u03b5e\u03c9/c is the wave vector of radiation in the medium. It follows from the\nMaxwell equations that the electric field strength is defined as\n1\nEpol \u2248 ER = \u2212 \u221a e \u00d7 HR .\n\u03b5\n3\n\n(8)\n\n\fLet us consider radiation generated during uniform rectilinear motion of a charged particle\nalong the axis of a cylindrical vacuum channel of radius a in a screen of thickness d and outer\nradius b (see Fig.1a.). To determine the radiation field, we must evaluate the volume integral\nin expression (7), in which the field of the particle is defined by the well-known expression\n(see, for example, [15]):\n\u03c9\ne\u03c9 \u0010 \u03c1 h \u03c9\u03c1 i i v h \u03c9\u03c1 i\u0011 i z\nE (r, \u03c9) = 2\n\u2212\ne v ,\nK1\nK0\n\u03c0v \u03b3 \u03c1\nv\u03b3\n\u03b3v\nv\u03b3\n0\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03c1 = {x, y} and K0 , K1 are modified Bessel functions of the second kind.

Re-reflection of waves in\nthe substance can be taken into account (see Section 3), but allowance for re-reflection of\nwaves in the vacuum channel is impossible in the given approach. If, however, we confine\nour analysis to the case of not too low energies of the particle (\u03b2 - 1), this constraint is\nsubstantial only for large thicknesses of the screen because Cherenkov radiation is known\nto be unable to enter into the vacuum from the medium through the plane parallel to the\nvelocity vector of the particle (total internal reflection; see [16] and Section 4 below), while\ndiffraction radiation propagates at small angles \u03b8 \u223c \u03b3 \u22121 \u226a 1 in the relativistic case. To\nderive a quantitative condition, we assume that the wave is emitted at angle \u03b8 = \u03b3 \u22121 at\npoint z = \u2212d and reaches the opposite end of the channel at point z = 0 (see Fig.1b.).\nThen the condition for the absence of re-reflection of radiation in the channel and, hence,\nthe condition for the applicability of the formulas derived below is the inequality\nd \u226a dmax = 2a\u03b3.\n\n(12)\n\nIf the radius of the channel is several times larger than the radiation wavelength (otherwise,\nre-reflections can simply be disregarded), the value of dmax is an order of magnitude larger\nthan parameter \u03b3\u03bb. For the terahertz wavelength range and for relativistic energies of\nthe particle, the experimental values of the screen thickness satisfy the conditions for the\napplicability of the model because dmax in this case amounts to more than a few tens of\ncentimeters. In the optical range, the model is valid only for high energies (\u03b3 \u223c 103 and\nhigher). Finally, in the X-ray spectral range, reflections can also be disregarded.\nIntegration in formula (10) is carried out using the known relations for Bessel functions\n[17].

However,\nthe field of the wave incident from the absorbing medium on the screen boundary located in\nthe z = 0 plane (see Fig.1a) naturally differs from (13). To solve the problem of refraction\nof the wave at the interface between the medium and vacuum correctly, we must use the\nwell-known reciprocity principle [20]:\n(ER(vac) , d(vac) ) = (ER(m) , d(m) ),\n\n(18)\n\nwhere ER(vac) \u2261 ER(vac) (r, \u03c9) is the sought radiation field in vacuum, which is produced by a\ndipole with moment d located in the medium, and ER(m) \u2261 ER(m) (r, \u03c9) is the radiation field\nin the medium, which is produced by the same dipole located in a vacuum far away from\nthe interface (in the wave zone). We assume that dipole moment d is oriented along the\nnormal to the surface through which radiation emerges (i.e., along the z axis in our case).\nPhysically, such an orientation means that a thin conducting screen at large distances can\nbe treated as a double layer. Taking into account that vector ER is perpendicular to e we\ncan find the modulus of the radiation field in a vacuum from formula (18):\n|ER(vac) | =\n\nsin \u0398 R(m)\n1\n1\nE\n= \u221a ER(m) = HR(m) ,\nsin \u03b8\n\u03b5\n\u03b5\n5\n\n(19)\n\n\fHere, we have used the Snell's law connecting \"vacuum\" angle \u03b8 and angle \u0398 in the medium,\nas well as the fact that the following equality holds for the fields of a spherical wave in the\nmedium: |ER(m) | = |\u03b5\u22121/2 HR(m) |.\nThe relations between the angles at which radiation is emitted in the medium and in the\nvacuum, which appear in formula (13), can be expressed as follows (compare with (11)):\np\n1\ne = \u221a {sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6, sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6, \u03b5 \u2212 sin2 \u03b8}.\n\u03b5\n\n(20)\n\nThen, in accordance with formula (19), we must find the magnetic field in the medium in\nthe case when the field of the wave incident on the interface from vacuum can be expressed in\nterms of field (13); i.e., we must solve the inverse problem. In the case of conducting media,\none can confine the analysis to conventional Fresnel laws for only one interface (i.e., one can\ndisregard the waves reflected in the substance from the second boundary of the screen, which\nlies in the z = \u2212d plane). Such an algorithm was used in our previous publication [21]. In\nthe general case, the field incident on the interface is not equal to \"forward\" radiation (13)\nbecause the \"backward\" radiation waves propagating at angles \u0398 > \u03c0/2 can also emerge into\nthe vacuum through the front face of the plate after their reflection from the rear face. In\naddition, refraction of the wave incident from vacuum onto the screen should be considered\ntaking into account possible multiple re-reflections inside it. Here, an important stipulation\nconcerning the screen thickness d under investigation is due. If the size of the region through\nwhich radiation emerges into vacuum is much larger than the screen thickness (thin screen),\nand the medium has a non-zero absorbance (\u03b5\u2032\u2032 6= 0), the waves reflected from the upper\nand lower faces of the plate can be disregarded. Indeed, if the inequality (b \u2212 a) \u226b d holds,\nonly the waves of Cherenkov radiation with \u0398 \u223c \u03c0/2 are incident on the upper and lower\nfaces of the screen, which corresponds to \u03b5\u2032 \u226b 1. It was mentioned above that such waves\nexperience total internal reflection and can emerge into the vacuum through the front face\nof the plate at angles \u03b8 \u223c \u03c0/2. We will return to this question in Section 5.\nOn account of the above arguments, we assume that the wave incident on the interface\nconsists of the field of \"forward\" radiation (13), which will be denoted below by index (F ),\nas well as the field of \"backward\" radiation reflected from the rear face of the screen in the\nz = \u2212d plane (index (B)). The backward radiation field can be determined from formula\n(13)\np as usual by the\np inversion of the z-projection of the wave vector or by the substitution\n2\n\u03b5 \u2212 sin \u03b8 \u2192 \u2212 \u03b5 \u2212 sin2 \u03b8. When quantities in relation (19) are squared, expression\n|HR(m) |2 must be written as the sum of the squared moduli of the field components, one of\nwhich is perpendicular to the plane of incidence of the wave on the interface, and the other\nlies in the plane of incidence. Considering that the magnetic field component lying in the\nplane of incidence\n\u221a is connected with the electric field component perpendicular to the plane\nof incidence via \u03b5, we finally obtain the following relations for the energy emitted into the\nvacuum (into half-space z > 0):\nd2 W\nd2 W\nd2 W\n+\n=\n= cr 2 |ER(vac) |2 =\nd\u03c9d\u03a9\nd\u03c9d\u03a9 \u22a5 d\u03c9d\u03a9 k\n\u0011\n\u221a\ncr 2 \u0010\n2\nR\nR\n2\n2\nR\nR\n2\n= 2 |fH | |H\u22a5(F ) + RH H\u22a5(B) | + | \u03b5fE | |Hk(F ) + RE Hk(B) | .\n|\u03b5|\n\n(21)\n\nIt should be noted that when the wave (13) is\u221aincident from vacuum, the amplitude of the\nspherical wave must be taken without factor \u03b5 in the exponent.

Indeed, for consideration\nof radiation emerging from the rear face of the screen, we must\npof indices\npchange the places\n2\n2\n(F ) and (B) in formula (21), which leads to the substitution \u03b2 \u03b5 \u2212 sin \u03b8 \u2192 \u2212\u03b2\np \u03b5 \u2212 sin \u03b8\nin the firstptwo terms in formula (26), as well as the substitution \u03b2 sin2 \u03b8 \u2212 \u03b5 \u2212 sin2 \u03b8 \u2194\n\u03b2 sin2 \u03b8 + \u03b5 \u2212 sin2 \u03b8. The latter substitution breaks the symmetry observed in the limiting\ncase of transition radiation. Simple sign reversal of the particle velocity in formula (26) is\nimpossible if only in view of the fact that, in this formula, as well as in the initial expression\n(9) for the particle field, the velocity appears in the argument of the Bessel function and it\nis a positive quantity.\nIt is convenient to calculate the energy emitted in the backward direction in the same\ncoordinate system (as before, \u03b8 < \u03c0/2 in this case) by changing the direction of the particle\nvelocity, which leads to sign reversal of the z-component of the particle field (9), as well as\nto the substitution z \u2192 \u2212z in the exponent.

This is due to the fact that radiation emitted\nin the direction of the particle velocity can be reflected from the front face of the screen and\nemerge into the vacuum though the rear face.\nIn the special case of ideal conductivity (\u03b5\u2032\u2032 \u2192 \u221e), the dependence on screen thickness d\ndisappears (skin effect), and we have the following expression for diffraction radiation from\na circular aperture in an infinitely thin screen of a finite radius:\n\u0010 \u03c9 \u00112 \u0010\nd2 W\nd2 W\ne2\n\u03b62 \u00112\n\u03b2 2 sin2 \u03b8\n=\n= 2\n\u03b6\n+\n,\n(31)\n1\nd\u03c9d\u03a9 F\nd\u03c9d\u03a9 B \u03c0 c (1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 cos2 \u03b8)2 v\u03b3\n\u03b2\u03b3 sin \u03b8\n\nNote that the energy emitted in both directions is the same in this case. This solution coincides with that obtained earlier in [3] using another method and (in the ultrarelativistic case)\nwith the results obtained in [9, 25\u201327], where the problem was solved in the ultrarelativistic\nlimit from the very outset. Since the dependence on the screen thickness has disappeared,\nformula (31) is also valid for a non-relativistic charge if radiation losses can still be regarded\nas small as compared to the total energy of the particle.\nIt should be emphasized that consideration of radiation emerging from the screen into\nvacuum through the z = 0 plane corresponds to a small screen thickness and, accordingly,\nto the emergence of the skin effect for \u03b5\u2032\u2032 \u226b 1 exactly in the vicinity of this plane. For\nthis reason, the transition to radiation in a perfectly conducting waveguide, as well as the\ntransition to Cherenkov radiation in an infinitely long channel, cannot be made using the\nformulas provided.\n\n3\n\nPolarization Radiation from a Rectangular Screen\n\nIn the case of azimuthal symmetry of the problem, the terms with coefficient fE make\nzero contribution to general expression (21) for the emitted energy because the magnetic field\nis polarized perpendicularly to the plane of incidence. If polarization radiation is generated\nby a particle moving near a rectangular screen (see Fig. 2), this circumstance does not take\nplace because the azimuthal symmetry is broken. In the coordinate system used here, the\nmagnetic field components of radiation have the form\nR\nR\nR\nH\u22a5(F,B)\n= Hx(F,B)\ncos \u03c6 \u2212 Hy(F,B)\nsin \u03c6,\nq\nR\nR\nR\nR\n)2 + (Hx(F,B)\nsin \u03c6 + Hy(F,B)\ncos \u03c6)2 .\nHk(F,B)\n= (Hz(F,B)\n\n(32)\n\nTo find the radiation field, we take advantage of the fact that the screen width along the\nx axis is infinitely large.

This expression also contains the Cherenkov pole\nassociated with the contribution of waves reflected from the front face of the screen and\nemerging into the vacuum through the rear face.\nIn the special case of a perfectly conducting semi-plane (\u03b5\u2032\u2032 \u2192 \u221e, a \u2192 \u221e), the energy\n\n11\n\n\femitted into both half-spaces is also the same and given by\n\u221a\nd2 W\ne2 1 \u2212 sin2 \u03b8 sin2 \u03c6 + (\u03b2\u03b3 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6)2 (1 + cos2 \u03b8) \u2212h 2\u03c9\n1+(\u03b2\u03b3 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6)2\nv\u03b3\n= 2\ne\n,\n2\n2\n2\nd\u03c9d\u03a9\n4\u03c0 c\n(1 \u2212 \u03b2 cos \u03b8)(1 + (\u03b2\u03b3 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6) )\n\n(40)\n\nwhich coincides with the result obtained in [3, 4] using another approach.\nComparison of the above formulas with the results obtained in the previous section shows\nthat the lack of azimuthal symmetry leads to the emergence of factor 1 + (\u03b2\u03b3 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6)2 in\nthe denominator of the formulas for the emitted energy, which gives in the relativistic case\na radiation peak in the vicinity of the yz plane (perpendicular to the plane of the screen)\nfor angles \u03b8 \u226b \u03b3 \u22121 (i.e., in fact, for Cherenkov radiation; see also [9, 21]). In view of the\nabsence of factor sin2 \u03b8 in the numerators of formulas (38) and (39), the peak in the angular\ndistribution of diffraction radiation corresponds to angle \u03b8 = 0, as expected. The absence\nof the \"Lorentz term\" 1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 cos2 \u03b8 in the denominator of the expressions for the parallel\ncomponent of intensity d2 W/d\u03c9d\u03a9|k is also worth noting.\n\n4\n\nPolarization Radiation form a Thin Grating of a Finite Permittivity\n\nThe method of induced currents being developed in this paper can also be employed for\ncalculating radiation emitted by atoms and molecules of a grating consisting of N strips\nwith a rectangular cross section and a finite permittivity \u03b5(\u03c9) = \u03b5\u2032 + i\u03b5\u2032\u2032 under the action\nof the field of a moving particle (so-called Smith-Purcell radiation; see Fig. 3). To simplify\ncalculations, we can require, analogously to the previous section, that thickness b of the\nstrips be much smaller than the strip length d \u2212 a:\nb \u226a d \u2212 a,\n\n(41)\n\nwhere d is the grating period and a is the width of the vacuum gap between the strips. In\nthis case, we can assume that radiation emerges into the vacuum only through the upper\nor lower faces of the strips. Since large emission angles \u03b8 are mainly of practical interest\nfor Smith-Purcell radiation, the thin-grating approximation employed here can be used for\ndescribing actual experiments in the relevant field.\nHowever, in the geometry considered here, in addition to the thin-grating approximation,\nwe must require that the width of the vacuum gaps between the strips be much smaller than\nthe radiation wavelength. For a large number of periods N \u226b 1 the radiation wavelength\nis rigidly connected with the grating period (see below); therefore, for all angles \u03b8 far from\nzero and \u03c0, this condition has the form\na \u226a \u03bb \u223c d.\n\n(42)\n\nThis condition stems from the fact that while multiple re-reflections of radiation in each strip\ncan be generally taken into account, re-reflections of radiation in the vacuum gaps cannot be\naccounted for in the given approach. If, however, the strips are quite thin (b \u226a d), allowance\nfor multiple re-reflections of radiation between the strips would have led to corrections in\nthe range of angles \u03b8 \u223c b/d \u226a 1 even if condition (42) were violated. For this reason, we\nwill assume in further analysis that the following inequalities are satisfied:\n\u03c0 \u2212 b/d > \u03b8 > b/d.\n\n(43)\n\nIt will be clear from further analysis that condition (42) essentially leads to the representation of the radiation field from the grating in the form of the vector sum of the radiation fields\n12\n\n\ffrom each strip, which is obviously true only when re-reflections of radiation between the\nstrips are ignored and for the angles satisfying inequalities (43). In the approach developed\nhere (which takes into account the actual dielectric properties of the grating), summation\nis performed for radiation fields inside the medium and not in the vacuum, which exactly\ncorresponds to small scattering of radiation by the particles with a size a \u226a \u03bb. Finally,\nformulas (21) for the radiation intensity, as well as formulas (25) for the Fresnel coefficients\nderived for an infinitely large plate, can be used only under conditions (41) and (42). This\ncircumstance imposes substantial constraints on the domain of applicability for a number of\nwell-known models of radiation, in which calculations were performed from the very outset\nfor a perfectly conducting grating (see Section 5 below).\nLet us first consider radiation above the grating (i.e., in the half-space in which the charge\nmoves). It is convenient to solve the problem in variables \u03b8, \u03c6 used in the previous section\n(components of the unit vector of radiation are given in expression (35)). A transition to\nvariables \u03b8, \u03c6 which are conventionally used in the Smith-Purcell radiation geometry can be\nmade in the final formulas. The expression for the required Fourier component of the field\nof the charge in the \"vacuum variables\" has the form\n\u03c9 \u2032\n\nE0 (kx , y \u2032, z \u2032 , \u03c9) =\n\n\u2212ie\nei v y\np\n{\u03b2\u03b3 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6, \u03b3 \u22121 ,\n2\n2\u03c0v 1 + (\u03b2\u03b3 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6)\n\u221a\np\n\u03c9\n1+(\u03b2\u03b3 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6)2\n(z \u2032 \u2212h) v\u03b3\n2\n\u2212i 1 + (\u03b2\u03b3 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6) }e\n.\n\n(44)\n\nHere, h is the distance between the particle trajectory and the grating. The radiation field\ninside the grating can be determined analogously to formula (33) (the grating width along\nthe x axis is assumed to be infinitely large), the only difference being that the integration\nis carried out over the volume of all N strips. The field components required for calculating\nthe energy emitted into the vacuum are then determined using formulas (32).

In this case, the field of the particle differs\nfrom expression (44) in the sign of the z-component and in the substitution z \u2032 \u2192 \u2212z \u2032 in the\nexponent. The magnetic field components of radiation into the half-space z > 0 (containing\nno particle) differ from components (46) with the subscript (B) in the reversal of the sign of\nb in the exponent (as in the previous section).

The reason for quantity h (and not h \u2212 b) appearing in formula (48) is the fact that\nwe consider radiation into the half-space z > 0, and in the limit of a conducting grating, the\nskin effect appears in the vicinity of z = 0 plane.\nFormulas (47) and (48) for the radiation intensity can also be written in variables \u03b8, \u03c6,\nwhich are conventionally used in the geometry of Smith-Purcell radiation.

However, the argument of the delta-function 1 \u2212 \u03b2 cos \u03b8 never vanishes, which\ncorresponds to the condition for the total internal reflection of radiation from the upper and\nlower faces of the strip.

[29].\nIt is significant that formula (56) for a perfectly conducting infinitely thin grating can\nalso be derived using a completely different approach. Namely, we can assume that radiation\nis generated by the surface current induced on the grating. Such an approach, which was\ndeveloped in [29] in the problem of Smith-Purcell radiation (see also [30]), has the following\ndisadvantage: the surface current is usually assumed to have only two tangential components\n(analogously to the theory of diffraction of ordinary plane waves). It was shown in [4] that\nin the general case, when the field incident on a perfectly conducting plane has all three\ncomponents, the surface density of the induced current must also have three components\nincluding the component normal to the surface. The normal component of the current\ndensity may be disregarded only in the ultrarelativistic case, when field E0 of the particle\ncan be treated as transverse. The intensity of Smith-Purcell radiation determined using such\na model of the generalized surface current completely coincides with expression (56) [31]. As\nexpected, in the ultrarelativistic limit, this result coincides with that calculated in [29] in\nthe model with a surface current with zero normal component. This probably explains the\nconformity of predictions of the model [29] to the experimental results [32] obtained for an\nelectron bunch with an energy of 28.5 GeV.\nIt should also be noted that analogously to the previous section, the presence of factor\n1+(\u03b2\u03b3 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6)2 in the denominators of formulas (47), (48), and (56) leads to concentration\nof radiation emitted at large angles \u03b8 \u226b \u03b3 \u22121 in the plane perpendicular to the plane of the\ngrating (i.e., close to small azimuthal angles \u03c6 - \u03b3 \u22121 ). The minimum observed strictly at\nangle \u03c6 = 0 disappears in the ultrarelativistic limit in accordance with expression (59).\n\n5\n\nDiscussion\n\nAll types of radiation considered in the present paper (Cherenkov radiation, transition\nradiation, diffraction radiation, and Smith-Purcell radiation) physically originate as a result\nof dynamic polarization of atoms and molecules of the medium by the field of an external\nsource. Therefore, it is natural to use a unified formalism in their description. We have\ndemonstrated that the method of induced currents makes it possible to determine the characteristics of various types of polarization radiation and is applicable for a wide class of\nshapes of the surfaces. In this study, the actual dielectric properties of a substance are\nsystematically taken into account in problems of polarization radiation in media with sharp\nboundaries of an intricate shape. In the limiting case of perfect conductivity, all results\ncoincide with those available in the literature. It may be shown that in another limiting\ncase of small permittivity (|\u03b5(\u03c9) \u2212 1| \u226a 1) all the solutions obtained also coincide with\ncorresponding results of perturbation theory (see e.g. Refs. [9, 11\u201313]).\nThe solutions obtained in this study can be used in various applications of polarization\nradiation, in particular, in the development of new types of monochromatic radiation sources\nand in the physics of accelerators. For each of the problems considered in this paper, the\napplicability boundaries of the results can be indicated.\n1. In the problem of radiation in a cylindrical channel considered in Section 2, we assumed\nthat the screen thickness d is so small that radiation emerging through the outer and inner\nwalls of the cylinder can be ignored. In the relativistic case, the condition for the applicability\nof the solution to this problem can be written in the form of a single inequality. Indeed, the\n17\n\n\feffective region of the screen participating in the formation of radiation is (b \u2212 a)ef f \u2248 \u03b3\u03bb.\nTherefore, the waves emitted through the outer surface of the cylinder may play a significant\nrole only if the outer radius b \u226a \u03b3\u03bb. On the other hand, only Cherenkov radiation waves\nare in fact incident on the outer surface of the cylinder (when the relevant condition is\nsatisfied) because diffraction radiation waves propagate at small angles \u03b8 \u223c \u03b3 \u22121 \u226a 1 in the\nrelativistic case. Cherenkov radiation incident on the outer as well as inner surface of the\ncylinder experiences total internal reflection and can emerge into the vacuum through the\nfront and rear faces of the screens at angles \u03b8 \u223c \u03c0/2. If we confine our analysis to the angles\nof emission not too close to \u03c0/2, the condition for the applicability of our results for all\nvalues of channel radius a \u226b \u03bb and screen width (b \u2212 a) % \u03b3\u03bb has the following simple form:\nd \u226a \u03b3\u03bb.\n\n(60)\n\nFor experimental values of d larger than a few millimeters, it follows that in the optical and\ninfrared ranges, the solution obtained here can be used only for ultrarelativistic particles.\nFor frequencies from the X-ray range, we can disregard re-reflections and constraint (60)\nimposed on the screen thickness becomes invalid.\n2. In the problem of radiation from a rectangular screen in Section 3, we must consider\ntwo limiting values of the screen length: a > \u03b3\u03bb and a - \u03b3\u03bb. In the former case, the\nscreen length can be assumed to be infinitely large, and the condition for the admissible\nscreen thickness coincides with (60). In the latter case, the geometrical size of the screen is\nimportant; therefore, the following condition must be satisfied:\nd \u226a a.\n\n(61)\n\n3. The condition for the applicability of the solution to the problem of radiation from the\ngrating in Section 4 (inequalities (41), (42), and (43)) is even more important because these\nconditions also determine the applicability boundaries for the solutions existing earlier and\nobtained for perfectly conducting gratings using the models of surface currents, for which\nthese boundaries are not obvious. Indeed, the field of radiation from a grating in vacuum\nin these models can be presented in the form of the vector sum of the field of radiation\nfrom each strip. The expression for the density of the current induced on the strip surface\nby the field of a moving charge is sought in different models using different methods (see,\nfor example, [29\u201331, 33]). For a grating consisting of strips with a finite permittivity and\nseparated by vacuum gaps, such a summation can be carried out only if the strips are closely\nspaced (a \u226a \u03bb \u223c d) and multiple re-reflection of waves in the gaps can be ignored. Naturally,\nthis condition remains in force in the case of perfectly conducting infinitely thin strips also;\nhowever, it is not specified in models of surface currents, in which the problem is initially\nsolved for a perfect conductor.\nIndeed, it appears at first glance that re-reflections can be disregarded for infinitely thin\nstrips, and the results (formula (56)) must be applicable for any width a of vacuum gaps.\nHowever, as emphasized above, on account of the real dielectric properties of the grating\nmaterial, the vector summation of the radiation fields from each strip is carried out for\nthe interior of the medium and not for the vacuum. Such a procedure has sense only if\nthe strips are closely spaced. The application of Fresnel coefficients as well as formula (21)\nfor the radiation intensity, which were derived for an infinitely large plate, is also limited\nby condition (42) in the problem of the grating. In the models of surface currents, the\nexpression for the current itself is usually derived by disregarding distortion at the edges of\na strip (i.e., as for a perfectly conducting semi-plane [29, 33]). This approximation precisely\ncorresponds to disregarding re-reflections of radiation between the strips as well as the use of\nthe Fresnel coefficients for an infinitely large plate in the problem with a finite conductivity\nof the grating. Since the gratings with vacuum gaps between the strips are conventionally\n18\n\n\fused for generating radiation in the terahertz and microwave ranges, the inequality a \u226a d\ncan easily be realized in experiments.\nIn conclusion, we note that the well-known fact of the zero radiation intensity at even\nharmonics for a = d/2, which is predicted by the models of surface currents (see formula (57)\nas well as [29, 33]) and which is absent in the van den Berg's model [28], can be explained\nby the fact that the models of surface currents for the given vacuum gap width can be used\nonly for qualitative analysis.\nAcknowledgments.
