After their identification in the solar wind they started to be\nstudied in winds of stars located in different regions of the HR diagram. We discuss here\nsome characteristics of these waves and we present a direct application in the acceleration\nof late-type stellar winds.\n1. Introduction\nIn 1942 combining fluid hydrodynamics and electromagnetism Hannes Alfv\u00e9n discovered\na new mode of waves, thus opening a new field of research. He studied the mutual\ninteraction between conducting fluid motion and electromagnetic fields and discovered\nthese waves (Alfv\u00e9n, 1942) that later on were named Alfv\u00e9n waves. However, to be\nverified the waves needed to be detected in laboratory experiments. This was done in the\nlate 40s and beginning of the 50s, in experiments with mercury and liquid sodium. It was\ndiscovered that in liquid metals the waves are strongly damped. In the 60s, experiments in\nplasma demonstrated weakly damped Alfv\u00e9n waves with the properties predicted by the\ntheory. Since then this field has expanded mainly due to space studies and thermonuclear\nresearch, making possible, among other things, to create high temperature plasma in\nlaboratories.\nAn Alfv\u00e9n wave propagating in a plasma is a traveling oscillation of the ions and the\nmagnetic field. The ion mass density provides the inertia and the magnetic field line\ntension provides the restoring force. The wave vector can either propagate in the parallel\ndirection of the magnetic field or at oblique incidence. The waves efficiently carry energy\nand momentum along the magnetic field lines.\nIdentification of Alfv\u00e9n waves in the solar wind by means of spacecraft measurements\nwas first achieved in late 60s. In 2007, Tomczyk et al. (2007) reported the detection of\nAlfv\u00e9n waves in images of the solar corona with the Coronal Multi-Channel Polarimeter\ninstrument at the National Solar Observatory, New Mexico. Also in 2007, several research\ngroups reconfirmed that Alfv\u00e9n waves have sufficient energy to heat the solar corona and\nmomentum to accelerate the solar wind (De Pontieu et al., 2007; Okamoto et al., 2007).\nThe Sun is a benchmark for stellar research providing an example of a cool main sequence\nstar losing mass.\nSince the discovery of the high velocity winds from O and B supergiant stars by Morton\n(1967) and his co-workers (Morton, Jenkins & Brooks, 1969), the theories of stellar winds\n\n\f2\n\nA. A. Vidotto and V. Jatenco-Pereira\n\nhad their interest amplified. On another part of the HR diagram, the winds from evolved\nK and M stars, characterized by low velocities, demanded a different theoretical approach.\nAlthough presenting very different terminal velocities, in the range of 600 - 3500 km s\u22121\nfor early-type and 10 - 100 km s\u22121 for late-type K and M stars, these stars present a\nsimilarity: both luminous early and late-type stars are losing mass at a rate as high as\n10\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (Lamers & Cassinelli, 1999).\nThe idea that a flux of Alfv\u00e9n waves could accelerate winds of stars in many regions\nof the HR diagram remount from a few decades ago (Hollweg, 1973, 1987; Hartmann\n& MacGregor, 1980; Holzer, Fla & Leer, 1983; Underhill 1983; Hartmann & Avrett,\n1984; Jatenco-Pereira and Opher, 1989a,b,c; dos Santos, Jatenco-Pereira and Opher, 1993;\nJatenco-Pereira, Opher and Yamamoto, 1994; among others). The belief that Alfv\u00e9n\nwaves are present in the magnetized winds of cool giant stars is supported by the fact\nthat these waves are observed in the solar wind (Smith et al., 1995; Balogh et al., 1995).\nIf there are oscillations in the magnetic field at the base of the wind, Alfv\u00e9n waves will be\ngenerated. As they propagate outward, the dissipation of their energy and the transfer\nof their momentum to the plasma can heat and accelerate the wind. As an example of\nhow these waves can be used as an acceleration mechanism of a stellar wind, we show\nlater on this paper a simple model to explain the mass-loss in a typical supergiant K5\nstar (Section 3). In Section 2, we present the issue of the damping of the Alfv\u00e9n waves.\nIn Section 4, we apply this model to a typical K5 supergiant star and in Section 5, we\ndraw our conclusions.\n2. The damping mechanism for Alfv\u00e9n waves\nFor cool red giant stars the flux of Alfv\u00e9n waves can provide an efficient driving mechanism for the wind. In this mechanism it is the wave magnetic pressure that accelerates\nthe wind. Hartmann & MacGregor (1980) showed that if the waves are not damped, the\nresultant terminal velocities are much higher than observed. Assuming that the waves are\ndamped with a constant damping length, they obtained terminal velocities and mass-loss\nrate consistent with the observations.\nIn order to improve the model presented by Hartmann & MacGregor (1980), JatencoPereira & Opher (1989a) discarded the use of an artificial constant damping length for\nthe waves and considered three different physical damping mechanisms: (i) the nonlinear\ndamping, (ii) the resonant surface damping, and (iii) the turbulent damping. They showed\nthat, for an isothermal atmosphere with T \u223c 104 K, their model can reproduce the\nobserved large mass-loss rates and the small ratios between the terminal velocity and the\nescape velocity at the base (u\u221e /ve0 ) of these stellar winds.\nTo illustrate this mechanism, we present a simplified version of this model (see Vidotto\n& Jatenco-Pereira, 2006; Falceta-Gon\u00e7alves, Vidotto & Jatenco-Pereira, 2006 for a more\ncomplete analysis). We focus our study on the resonant surface damping for the Alfv\u00e9n\nwaves. A surface wave exists at the interface separating two environments, e.g., open\nmagnetic flux tubes. Magnetohydrodynamic surface waves may decay through a process\ncalled \"resonance absorption\" (Hollweg, 1987), that leads to a concentration of the surface\nwave energy into the thin resonant layer. In this layer, the energy may be dissipated locally\nas heat or concentrated in the form of turbulent Alfv\u00e9n waves which may propagate further\n\n\fAlfv\u00e9n waves as a driving mechanism in stellar winds\n\n3\n\nand be dissipated elsewhere, or concentrated in other forms, such as high energy particles,\nelectric currents, etc. In the present paper we suggest that resonant absorption dissipates\nthe energy locally as heat with the damping length L given by (Jatenco-Pereira & Opher,\n1989a)\nvA\nvA0\n\nL = L0\n\n!2 v\nu\nu A(r0 )\nt\n(1 + M) ,\n\n(1)\n\nA(r)\n\nwhere L0 is the damping length of the wave at the base of \u221a\nthe wind, M = u/vA is the\nAlfv\u00e9n-Mach number, the Alfv\u00e9n speed is given by vA = (B/ 4\u03c0\u03c1) and A(r) is the crosssection of a flux tube at a radial distance r. The index \"0\" indicates that the parameter\nis being evaluated at the stellar surface, i.e., at r = r0 . If a large damping length is\nconsidered (i.e., there is a smooth damping of the wave throughout the wind), there will\nbe a non negligible outward force acting beyond the critical point of the wind, creating\nthus a high-speed wind. Hence, the damping length cannot be too large. This will also\nassure that the WKB approximation is valid in the wind we study.\n3. Model\nThe first attempts in accelerating winds by means of Alfv\u00e9n waves considered that\nthe waves were propagating in an isothermal ambient. This assumption simplifies the\nequations, since the energy equation simply reads T = constant. However, if we are\ninterested in modeling the temperature profile of the wind, there is a need to solve a\nconsistent energy equation simultaneously with the mass and momentum equations of\nthe wind. In this way, we are able to obtain both the temperature and the velocity\nprofiles of the wind and compare them with observations.\n3.1. Geometry of the Magnetic Field Lines\nFor a long time, it is known that the coronal holes are the source of the high-speed\nsolar wind streams at the Earth's orbit (e.g., Peter & Judge, 1999). Solar coronal holes\nobservations show a superradial expansion of the magnetic flux tubes: the area expansion\nof a solar coronal hole is 5 \u2212 13 times greater than for a radial expansion (Lie-Svendsen,\nHansteen & Leer, 2002; Esser et al., 2005; Tu et al., 2005). Jatenco-Pereira & Opher\n(1989a) implemented the Alfv\u00e9n wave driven wind model by taking into account our\nknowledge on coronal holes in the Sun. We apply the same assumption for cool giant\nstars. For simplicity, we assume that in the wind of a typical K5 supergiant star, the\nnon-radial expansion factor is\nF =\n\n\u03a9\n= 10 ,\n\u03a90\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03a90 and \u03a9 are the solid angles measured at the stellar surface and at the edge of\nthe coronal hole, respectively. Hence, in order to model the diverging geometry for the\nmagnetic field, we follow the idea given by Kuin and Hearn (1982). Thus, the cross-section\nof a flux tube at a radial distance r is given by\nA(r) =\n\n(\n\nA(r0 )(r/r0 )S\nA(r0 )(rt /r0 )S (r/rt )2\n\nif r \u2264 rt\nif r > rt ,\n\n\f4\n\nA. A. Vidotto and V.

The magnetic field geometry is divergent up to the transition radius rt ,\ni.e., it has a superradial index S > 2. Beyond rt , the magnetic field lines become radial\nand the index equals 2.\n\nwhere S, the superradial index, is a parameter that determines the divergence of the\ngeometry from the stellar radius r0 up to the transition radius rt , as shown in Figure 1.\nFor a given S > 2, rt is obtained by\nF =\n\n\u03a9\nA(rt )/rt2\nrt\n=\n=\n2\n\u03a90\nA(r0 )/r0\nr0\n\u0012\n\n\u0013S\u22122\n\n.\n\n(3)\n\nHence, we have\nrt = F 1/(S\u22122) r0 .\n\n(4)\n\nConsidering this geometry, the conservation of magnetic flux yields a magnetic field intensity of\nB(r) = B0\n\nA(r0 )\n.\nA(r)\n\n(5)\n\nA detailed study of the diverging geometry of the magnetic field in the winds of late-type\nstars can be found in Jatenco-Pereira & Opher (1989a).\n3.2. Wind Equations\nThe equation of mass continuity expresses the conservation of mass. If the flow velocity\nis denoted by u and the gas density is \u03c1, we have in steady-state\n\u03c1uA(r) = C .\nThe constant C in equation (6) is computed at the wind base, i.e., C = \u03c10 u0 A(r0 ).\n\n(6)\n\n\fAlfv\u00e9n waves as a driving mechanism in stellar winds\n\n5\n\nAssuming a steady flow, the equation of motion is written as\n\u03c1u\n\nGM\u22c6 dP\nd h(\u03b4B)2 i\ndu\n= \u2212\u03c1 2 \u2212\n\u2212\n,\ndr\nr\ndr\ndr 8\u03c0\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u2212\u03c1GM\u22c6 /r 2 is the gravitational attraction force, \u2212dP/dr is the pressure gradient,\nand d[h(\u03b4B)2 i/(8\u03c0)]dr is the Alfv\u00e9n wave magnetic pressure gradient. The parameter \u03b4B\nis the magnetic field amplitude of the wave. It is related to the energy density \u01eb of the\nwave by\n\u01eb=\n\nh(\u03b4B)2 i\n.\n4\u03c0\n\n(8)\n\nThe energy equation is determined through the balance between wave heating, adiabatic\nexpansion, and radiative cooling (Hartmann, Edwards, & Avrett, 1982). Assuming an\nideal gas, we can write the gas pressure as P = \u03c1kB T /m, where kB is the Boltzmann\nconstant, T is the gas temperature, and m is the mean mass per particle. Thus, neglecting\nconduction, we write the energy equation as\nd\n\u03c1u\ndr\n\nGM\u22c6\nu 2 5 kB T\n+\n\u2212\n2\n2 m\nr\n\n!\n\n+\n\nu d\u01eb\n= (Q \u2212 PR ) .\n2 dr\n\n(9)\n\nThe term (u/2)d\u01eb/dr is the rate at which the waves do work on the gas. Q is the wave\nheating rate, i.e., the rate at which the gas is being heated due to dissipation of wave\nenergy, and PR is the radiative cooling rate, both in erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 . The wave heating can\nbe written as (Hollweg, 1973)\nQ=\n\n\u01eb\n(u + vA )\nL\n\n(10)\n\nand the radiative cooling is given by\nPR = \u039b ne nH ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere ne is the electron density, nH is the hydrogen density and \u039b is the radiative loss\nfunction.

Results and discussions\nThe model is applied here to the wind of a typical K5 supergiant star with a mass of\n16 M\u2299 and a radius of 400 R\u2299 . We adopt a temperature of 3500 K at the base of the wind,\nand assume that the magnetic field intensity is \u223c 10 G at this location. In our model,\nwe adopt an initial wave flux of \u03c6A0 \u223c 106 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , which is of the same order of\nmagnitude as the one estimated for the Sun (Banerjee et al., 1998), and take L0 = 0.2 r0\nand S = 5.2. The initial density is \u03c10 = 1.07 \u00d7 10\u221213 g cm\u22123 .\nWe perform the calculations until r = 300 r0, where the terminal velocity has been\nalready reached.\n4.1. Typical K5 supergiant star\nSimilarly to the wind first studied by Parker (1960), the momentum equation (eq. [15])\nhas a critical point when the term in brackets on the left-hand side becomes zero, and hence\nthe bracketed term on the right-hand side must necessarily be zero too. The requirement\nthat the wind velocity should increase through the critical point determines the initial\nvelocity at the base of the wind, i.e., du(r = r0 )/dr \u2265 0. Hence, to find the critical solution\nfor a given set of initial conditions, we iterate the initial velocity until the solution passes\nthrough the critical point. Together with the initial density, the initial velocity determines\nthe mass-loss rate.\nOur results are shown in Figure 2, where the velocity and the temperature profiles\nobtained were plotted for r \u2264 30 r0 . We obtained a terminal velocity of u\u221e \u2243 63 km s\u22121 \u2243\n0.5ve0 and a mass-loss rate of \u1e40 \u2243 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22127 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . These results compares favorably\nwith observations: observationally, the terminal velocity should be lower than the surface\nescape velocity in a ratio around 1:2, and the mass-loss rate should range from 10\u22128 to\n10\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (Linsky 1998).\nAccording to Roddier & Roddier (1985), the CII emission detected in cool winds of giant\nstars is associated to regions with temperatures of 7000 \u2212 9000 K. Carpenter, Robinson,\n& Judge (1995) obtained, for the wind of \u03b3 Cru (M3.4III), a maximum temperature of\n\u223c 9000 K. Carpenter et al. (1999) found a maximum temperature of \u223c 10000 K for the\nwind of \u03bb Vel (K5Ib). For \u03b6 Aur (K4Ib), Eaton (1993) found that the wind temperature\n\n\f7\n\nAlfv\u00e9n waves as a driving mechanism in stellar winds\n7\n\n10\n\nu (r)\n10000\n\n10\n\n6\n\n6000\n\nT(K)\n\n-1\n\nu (cm s )\n\n8000\n\n4000\nT (r)\n2000\n5\n\n10\n\n1\n\n20\n\n10\n\n30\n\nr (r0)\n\nFigure 2. Velocity (solid line) and temperature (dashed line) profiles obtained for the\nwind of a typical K5 supergiant star.\n\nreaches 12000 K at \u223c 2 r0 . We can see in Figure 2 an abrupt rise in the temperature of\nthe wind: the temperature rises from 3.5 \u00d7 103 K to \u223c 104 K in the range from 1 r0 to\n\u223c 2 r0 . This heating is mainly due to the dissipation of the Alfv\u00e9n waves, ie, caused by\nthe wave damping. At large distances, when almost all the flux of Alfv\u00e9n waves has been\ndissipated, the flow expands adiabatically. Hence, in the absence of strong heating, the\ntemperature tends to fall monotonically with the adiabatic exponent 4/3.\nAs to exemplify the effects of the choice of L0 in our model, we have run a second model\ntaking into account a different value of initial damping length: L0 = 0.4 r0 . Comparing\nthis second model with the previous one, we obtained a value of \u223c 100 km/s while for\nthe first model a flow with a terminal velocity of \u223c 63 km/s was achieved. This situation\nis explained by the position where a large fraction of the energy is deposited in the wind.\nIf energy is mainly deposited in the super-critical part of the flow, as is the case for\nthe second model, the initial structure of the wind is not modified, i.e., it maintains the\nsame mass-loss rate, but the super-critical part is accelerated. Comparing the mass-loss\nrate, we obtained for the first model \u1e40 \u2243 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22127 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , while for the second\n\u1e40 \u2243 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22127 M\u2299 yr\u22121 .\n5. Conclusions\nWe presented here some characteristics of Alfv\u00e9n waves and showed how these waves\ncan be used as an acceleration mechanism of stellar winds. As a particular case, we\nevaluated the wind temperature and velocity profiles of a typical K5 supergiant star using\nan outward-directed flux of Alfv\u00e9n waves as the main acceleration mechanism of the wind.\nFor a typical K5 supergiant star, we obtained a high mass-loss rate and a low terminal\nvelocity consistent with observations.\n\n\f8\n\nA.
