The\nquadratic action for a free spin s field \u03c6n1 ...ns is fixed up to an overall factor in the form\nSs = \u03c6L\u03c6 with some second order differential operator L by the condition of gauge invariance under the Abelian gauge transformations \u03b4\u03c6n1 ...ns = \u2202{n1 \u03b5n2 ...ns } with symmetric\ntraceless tensor parameters \u03b5n1 ...ns\u22121 , \u03b5r rn3 ...ns\u22121 = 0. It is the higher spin (HS) gauge symmetry principle that makes the HS gauge theories interesting and perhaps fundamental.\nThe free HS gauge theories extend the linearized theories of electromagnetism (spin 1)\nand gravity (spin 2) in a uniform way. The original Fronsdal theory and its more geometric versions [2, 3] generalize the metric formulation of gravity. The HS generalization of\nCartan formulation of gravity with the HS fields described in terms of the frame-like 1forms was proposed in [4, 5]. Uniformity of geometric formulations of HS fields raises the\nquestion whether there exists an underlying nonlinear HS gauge theory which in the free\nfield limit gives rise to the free Fronsdal Lagrangians. There is a number of motivations\nfor studying HS gauge theories.\nFrom supergravity perspective, this is interesting because theories with HS fields may\nhave more supersymmetries than the \"maximal\" supergravities with 32 supercharges. Recall that the limitation that the number of supercharges is \u2264 32 is a direct consequence\nof the requirement that s \u2264 2 for all fields in a supermultiplet (see e.g. [6]). From superstring perspective, the most obvious motivation is due to Stueckelberg symmetries in the\nstring field theory [7], which have a form of spontaneously broken HS gauge symmetries.\nWhatever a symmetric phase of the superstring theory is, Stueckelberg symmetries are\nexpected to become unbroken HS symmetries in such a phase and the superstring field\n1\n\n\ftheory has to become one or another version of the HS gauge theory. An important indication in the same direction is that string amplitudes exhibit certain symmetries in the\nhigh-energy limit equivalent to the string mass parameter tending to zero [8].\nUnusual feature of interacting HS gauge theories is that unbroken HS gauge symmetries\ndo not allow flat space-time as a vacuum solution, requiring nonzero curvature [9]. Anti-de\nSitter (AdS) space is the most symmetric vacuum of this type. This property may admit\ninterpretation [10, 11, 12] in the context of the AdS/CF T correspondence conjecture [13].\nIn particular, it was conjectured [10, 11] that HS gauge theories in AdS bulk are dual to\nsome conformal models on the AdS boundary in the large N limit with g 2 N \u2192 0 where\ng 2 is the boundary coupling constant. Again, this indicates that HS gauge theory has a\ngood chance to be related to a symmetric phase of superstring theory. On the other hand,\na reason why the HS gauge theory may be hard to observe in superstring theory may be\nthat a quantum formulation of the latter is not still available in the AdS background\ndespite the progress achieved at the classical level [14].\nWhatever a motivation is, the HS problem is to find any nonlinear theory such that\n\u2022 In the free field limit it contains a set of Fronsdal fields (with correct signs of kinetic\nterms) plus, may be, some other fields that admit consistent quantization (e.g., mixed\nsymmetry massless fields which exist in d > 4 [15]).\n\u2022 HS gauge symmetries are unbroken in a nonlinear HS theory and are deformed to\nsome non-Abelian symmetry.\nThe first condition rules out ghosts1 . The condition that a HS symmetry is non-Abelian\navoids a trivial possibility of building a nonlinear theory with undeformed Abelian HS\nsymmetries by adding powers of gauge invariant HS field strengths to the Fronsdal action\nlike, for example, adding powers of the Maxwell field strengths to a collection of free\nMaxwell actions instead of deforming it to the Yang-Mills action. For the HS models we\ndiscuss, this condition is satisfied as a result of the manifest invariance under diffeomorphisms. A structure of the HS symmetry is one of the key elements of the theory.\nAlthough being absolutely minimal, these conditions are so restrictive that they were\nbelieved for a long period to admit no solution at all. One argument was due to the\nColeman-Mandula type no-go theorems [17] which state that any S matrix in flat spacetime, that has a symmetry larger than (semi)direct product of usual space-time (super)symmetries and inner symmetries, is trivial (S = Id). Since no scattering means no\ninteractions, this sounds like no theory with non-Abelian HS global symmetries can exist.\nAn alternative test was provided by the attempt [18] to introduce interactions of a HS\ngauge field with gravity. It is straightforward to see that the standard covariantization\nprocedure \u2202 \u2192 D = \u2202 \u2212\u0393 breaks down the invariance under the HS gauge transformations\nbecause, in order to prove invariance of the action Ss , one has to commute derivatives,\nwhile the commutator of the covariant derivatives is proportional to the Riemann tensor,\n[D . . . , D . . .] = R . . . . As a result, the gauge variation of the covariantized action Sscov\n\n1 Note that the standard HS field dynamics is free of ghosts but this is not the case, e.g., for the partially massless HS\nmodels of [16] in AdS.\n\n2\n\n\fis different from zero, having the structure\n\u03b4Sscov =\n\nZ\n\nR... (\u03b5...D\u03c6... ) 6= 0 .\n\n(1)\n\nIt seems difficult to cancel these terms because for s > 2 they contain the Weyl tensor\npart of R which cannot be compensated by a transformation of the gravitational field.\nOn the other hand, a number of indications on the existence of some consistent interactions of the HS fields were found both in the light-cone [19] and in the covariant\napproach [20], giving strong evidence that some fundamental HS gauge theory must exist.\nIn these works, the problem was considered in flat space. Somewhat later it was realized\n[9] that the situation improves drastically once the problem is analyzed in the AdS space\nwith nonzero curvature \u039b. This allowed constructing consistent 4d HS-gravitational interactions in the cubic order at the action level [9] and, later, in all orders in interactions\nat the level of equations of motion [21]. Recently, the 4d results of [21] were generalized\nto any space-time dimension [22].\nThe role of AdS background in HS gauge theories is important in many respects. In\nparticular it cancels the Coleman-Mandula argument because AdS space admits no Smatrix, and fits naturally the AdS/CFT correspondence conjecture. From the technical\nside, the dimensionful cosmological constant allows new types of HS interactions with\nhigher derivatives, which resolve the problem with HS-gravitational interactions as follows.\nThe Riemann tensor Rnm,kl is not small near AdS background but\nRnm,kl = Rnm,kl \u2212 \u039b(gnk gml \u2212 gnl gmk ) ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u039b is the cosmological constant, gmn is the background AdS metric tensor and R\nis a deviation of the Riemann tensor from the AdS background curvature. Expanding\naround the AdS geometry is therefore equivalent to expanding in powers of R rather than\nin powers of the Riemann tensor R. The crucial difference compared to the flat space is\nthat the commutator of covariant derivatives in the AdS space\n[Dn , Dm ] \u223c \u039b\n\n(3)\n\nis not small for general \u039b. With nonzero \u039b one can add to the action some cubic terms\nschematically written in the form\nS int =\n\nZ X\n\n1\n\n\u03b1(p, q)\u039b\u2212 2 (p+q) D p (\u03c6)D q (\u03c6)R ,\n\n(4)\n\np,q\n\nwhich contain higher derivatives2 with some of the coefficients proportional to negative\npowers of \u039b. There exists such a unique (modulo total derivatives and field redefinitions)\naction correction by the terms (4) with a minimal order of derivatives that its HS gauge\nvariation exactly compensates the original variation (1) (for any two given spins an order\nof minimally necessary derivatives in the vertex (4) is finite, increasing linearly with the\nsum of spins). This implies that \u039b should necessarily be nonzero in the phase with\nunbroken HS gauge symmetries. In that respect, HS gauge theories are analogous to\ngauged supergravities with charged gravitinos, which also require \u039b 6= 0.\n2 Dp\n\nand D q denote here some combinations of derivatives of orders p and q, respectively.\n\n3\n\n\fProperties of HS gauge theories are to large extent determined by HS global symmetries\nof their most symmetric vacua. HS symmetry restricts interactions and fixes spectra of\nspins of massless fields in HS theories as ordinary supersymmetry does in supergravity.\nTo elucidate the structure of a global HS (super)algebra h it is useful to use the approach\nin which fields, action and transformation laws are formulated in terms of the gauge fields\nof h. An attractive feature of this approach, which generalizes the MacDowell-MansouriStelle-West approach [23, 24] to gravity, is that it treats all fields as differential forms with\nthe gravitational field being on equal footing with other massless fields in a HS multiplet.\nThe only special property of the metric tensor is that it has a nonzero vacuum expectation\nvalue allowing a meaningful linearized approximation for all fields in the model. In section\n2 we recall the MacDowell-Mansouri-Stelle-West approach to gravity. Then in section 3\nwe show following to [5] how free HS fields can be reformulated in terms of differential\nforms to be interpreted as gauge connections. The non-Abelian HS algebra is defined in\nsection 4 in terms of some star-product algebra. Then we describe unfolded formulation\nof free field HS dynamics in section 5 and formulate nonlinear HS equations in section 6.\nSome conclusions and perspectives are summarized in the Conclusion.\n\n2\n\nGravity as o(d-1,2) gauge theory\n\nOur approach to higher spins generalizes the MacDowell-Mansouri-Stelle-West [23, 24]\nformulation of gravity as o(d \u2212 1, 2) gauge theory. The key observation is that the frame\n1-form ea (x) = dxn en a (x) and Lorentz connection \u03c9 ab (x) = dxn \u03c9n ab (x) can be interpreted\nas components of the o(d \u2212 1, 2) connection 1-form \u03c9 AB (x) = dxn \u03c9n AB (x) (a, b, . . . =\n0, . . . , d \u2212 1 are fiber Lorentz vector indices and A, B, . . . = 0, . . . , d are fiber o(d \u2212 1, 2)\nvector indices). The Lorentz subalgebra o(d \u2212 1, 1) \u2208 o(d \u2212 1, 2) is identified with the\nstability subalgebra of some vector V A . Since Lorentz symmetry is local, this vector can\nbe chosen differently at different points of space-time, thus becoming a field V A = V A (x).\nIt is convenient to relate its norm to the cosmological constant so that V A has dimension\nof length3\nV A VA = \u2212\u039b\u22121 .\n\n(5)\n\nThis allows for a covariant definition of the frame field and Lorentz connection [24]\nE A = D(V A ) \u2261 dV A + \u03c9 AB VB ,\n\n\u03c9 L AB = \u03c9 AB + \u039b(E A V B \u2212 E B V A ) .\n\n(6)\n\nAccording to these definitions, E A VA \u2261 0 , D L V A = dV A + \u03c9 L AB VB \u2261 0 . The theory is\nformulated in a way independent of a particular choice of V A . The simplest choice is with\nV A being a constant vector pointing at the (d + 1)th direction, i.e.,\nV A = |\u039b|\u22121/2 \u03b4dA .\n\n(7)\n\nThe Lorentz directions are those orthogonal to V A : V A AA = 0 \u2192 AA = Aa . In this\n\"standard gauge\" the Lorentz connection is \u03c9 ab , and ea = \u03c9 aB VB . When the frame EnA\nB\nhas the maximal rank d, it gives rise to the nondegenerate metric tensor gnm = EnA Em\n\u03b7AB .\n3 \u039b is negative and positive in the AdS and dS cases, respectively (within the mostly minus signature).

The resulting theory turns out to be expressed in terms of the frame\nfield and Lorentz connection contained in \u03c9 AB and, as it should, is manifestly invariant\nunder local Lorentz transformations and diffeomorphisms. Alternatively, expressing the\ncovariantized diffeomorphism parameters from (15)\n\u03be n gnm = EmA \u03b5AB VB\n\n(16)\n\nand using (14), one can interpret the mixture of diffeomorphisms and transformations from\no(d \u2212 1, 2)/o(d \u2212 1, 1), that leave invariant V A , as a deformation of the transformation\nlaw (12) for the connection \u03c9 AB by some R-dependent terms.\nWith the help of VA it is straightforward to write a d\u2013dimensional generalization [5] of\nthe MacDowell-Mansouri-Stelle-West action\nS=\u2212\n\n1\n4|\u039b|1/2 \u03bad\u22122\n\nZ\n\nMd\n\n\u01ebA1 ...Ad+1 RA1 A2 \u2227 RA3 A4 \u2227 E A5 \u2227 . . . \u2227 E Ad V Ad+1 .\n\n(17)\n\nObviously, among various solutions of the equations of motion of the action (17), any flat\nconnection with RAB = 0 is a solution. According to (10) it describes AdSd provided\nthat the metric is nondegenerate. (Different flat connections with nondegenerate metric\ndescribe AdSd in different coordinates.) This solution is most symmetric. Indeed, let\n\u03c90AB (x) be some solution of (10). According to (14), covariantized diffeomorphisms act\ntrivially on \u03c90 . Local o(d \u2212 1, 2) transformations (12) map one solution \u03c90 of (10) to\nanother. The transformations, that leave \u03c90 invariant, satisfy\nD0 \u03b5AB (x) = 0 ,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere D0 is the o(d \u2212 1, 2) covariant derivative constructed from \u03c90 . Equation (18) is\nformally consistent because D02 = 0. As a result, it determines all derivatives of the 0form \u03b5AB (x) in terms of its values \u03b5AB (x0 ) at any given point x0 . So, in the topologically\nAB\ntrivial situation, any solution \u03b5AB\n0 (x) of (18) is fixed in terms of \u03b50 (x0 ) \u2208 o(d \u2212 1, 2)\nwhich are arbitrary parameters of the global symmetry o(d \u2212 1, 2) of the vacuum (10). It\nis important to note that the same symmetry can be realized by diffeomorphisms generated\nby the Killing vector fields \u03be n (16) of the metric g0 nm = E0An E0 mA where E0 is defined\nby (6) with the AdS background connection \u03c90 AB . This explains why the space-time\nsymmetry algebras associated with the motions of the most symmetric vacuum spaces\nreappear as gauge symmetry algebras in the gauge approach to gravity.\nThe lesson is that, to describe a gauge model that has a global symmetry h, it is useful\nto reformulate it in terms of the gauge connections \u03c9 and curvatures R of h in such a\nway that the zero curvature equation R = 0 solves the field equations. If a symmetry\nh is not known, this observation can be used other way around to guess what it is by\nreformulating dynamics a la MacDowell-Mansouri to guess a structure of an appropriate\ncurvature R.\n\n6\n\n\f3\n\nHigher spin gauge fields\n\nIn the spin two case, the formulation in terms of gauge connections results from the\nextension gnm \u2212\u2192 {ean , \u03c9nab } \u2212\u2192 \u03c9nAB .

According\n8\n\n\fto the discussion of section 2, any h of this class is a candidate for a global HS algebra of\nthe symmetric vacuum of a HS theory. The existence of such an algebra was indicated by\nthe results of [25] where conserved currents (and therefore charges) in the free massless\nscalar field theory were shown to be described by various traceless two-row rectangular\nYoung tableaux of the conformal algebra. A formal definition of h as a conformal HS\nalgebra of symmetries of a scalar field theory in d \u2212 1 dimension was given by Eastwood\nin [26]. In this paper we use a slightly different definition of h which is more suitable for\nthe analysis of the HS interactions.\nConsider oscillators YiA with i = 1, 2 satisfying the commutation relations\n[YiA , YjB ]\u2217 = \u03b5ij \u03b7 AB ,\n\n\u03b5ij = \u2212\u03b5ji ,\n\n\u03b512 = 1 ,\n\n(27)\n\nwhere \u03b7 AB is the invariant metric of o(d \u2212 1, 2).

Due to the definition (30) of tij , the ideal I\ncontains all traces of the two-row Young tableaux. As a result, the algebra S/I has only\ntraceless two-row tableaux in the expansion (29).\n9\n\n\fNow consider the Lie algebra with the commutator in S/I as the product law. Its real\nform corresponding to a unitary HS theory in AdSd is called hu(1/sp(2)[d \u2212 1, 2]) [22].\nNote that, by construction, the AdSd algebra o(d \u2212 1, 2) with the generators T A,B is the\nsubalgebra of hu(1/sp(2)[n, m]).\nThe gauge fields of hu(1/sp(2)[d \u2212 1, 2]) are\n\u03c9(Y |x) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03c9A1 ...Al ,B1 ...Bl (x)Y1A1 . . .

Note that, because dtij = 0, the sp(2) invariance\ncondition, which imposes the Young symmetry properties, can be written in the covariant\nform\nD(tij ) \u2261 dtij + [\u03c9, tij ]\u2217 = 0 .\n(33)\nThe HS curvatures and gauge transformations have the standard Yang-Mills form\nR(Y |x) = d\u03c9(Y |x) + \u03c9(Y |x) \u2227 \u2217\u03c9(Y |x) ,\n\u03b4\u03c9(Y |x) = D\u03b5(Y |x) ,\n\nD\u03b5(Y |x) = d\u03b5(Y |x) + [\u03c9(Y |x), \u03b5(Y |x)]\u2217 .\n\n(34)\n(35)\n\nDifferent spins correspond to irreducible representations of o(d \u2212 1, 2) spanned by\nhomogeneous polynomials\n\u03c9(\u03bcY |x) = \u03bc2(s\u22121) \u03c9(Y |x) .\n(36)\n\n(Note that one unit of spin is carried by the 1-form index). In particular, spin 1 is\ndescribed by a 1-form \u03c9(x) = dxn \u03c9n (x). The algebra hu(1/sp(2)[d \u2212 1, 2]) is infinite\ndimensional. It contains o(d \u2212 1, 2) \u2295 u(1) as the maximal finite dimensional subalgebra\nwith the generators T AB (30) for o(d \u2212 1, 2) and constants for u(1). The corresponding\ngauge fields carry spins 2 and 1, respectively. Taking two HS symmetry parameters \u03b5s1\nand \u03b5s2 , being polynomials of degrees s1 \u2212 1 and s2 \u2212 1, respectively, one obtains\n[\u03b5s1 , \u03b5s2 ]\u2217 =\n\ns1 +s\n2 \u22122\nX\n\n\u03b5t .\n\n(37)\n\nt=|s1 \u2212s2 |+1\n\nThus, once a spin s > 2 gauge field appears, the HS symmetry algebra requires an infinite\ntower of HS gauge fields to be present. The barrier s \u2264 2 separates theories with infinite\ndimensional gauge symmetries from those with usual lower spin symmetries. It is tempting\nto speculate that the latter result from the spontaneous breaking of infinite dimensional\nHS symmetries down to usual lower spin symmetries. In that case, the HS gauge fields\nshould acquire masses as a result of this spontaneous HS symmetry breaking.\nThe formula (37) manifests the quantum-mechanical nonlocality of the oscillator algebra (27) (equivalently, the star product (28)). Because bilinear terms in the HS curvatures\n(34) describe interactions, one concludes that lower spins form sources for higher spins and\nvice versa. A less obvious fact, which follows from the HS field equations, is that the nonlocal character of the star product algebra results in the appearance of higher space-time\nderivatives in the HS interactions. Thus the star-product origin of the HS algebra links\n10\n\n\ftogether such seemingly different properties of the HS theories as the relevance of the AdS\nbackground, necessity of introducing infinitely many spins and space-time non-locality of\nthe HS interactions. Note that these properties make the HS theories reminiscent of the\nsuperstring theory with the analogy between the cosmological constant and \u03b1\u2032 .\nTo introduce inner symmetries, one considers following [27] matrix-valued gauge fields\n\u03c9(Y |x) \u2212\u2192 \u03c9\u03bd \u03bc (Y |x), \u03bc, \u03bd . . . = 1, . . . , p, imposing the reality condition\n[\u03c9\u03bd \u03bc (Y |x)]\u2020 = \u2212\u03c9\u03bd \u03bc (Y |x) ,\n\n(38)\n\nwhere the involution \u2020 combines matrix hermitian conjugation with the involution of the\nstar product algebra (YjA )\u2020 = iYjA . The resulting real Lie algebra is called hu(p|sp(2)|[d \u2212\n1, 2]). Its gauge fields describe the set of massless fields of all spins s \u2265 1 which take\nvalues in the adjoint representation of u(p). In particular, spin 1 gauge fields are u(p)\nYang-Mills fields.\nCombining the antiautomorphism of the star product algebra \u03c1(f (Y )) = f (iY ) with\nsome antiautomorphism of the matrix algebra generated by a nondegenerate form \u03c1\u03b1\u03b2 one\ncan impose the conditions [27]\n\u03c9\u03b1 \u03b2 (Y |x) = \u2212\u03c1\u03b2\u03b3 \u03c1\u03b4\u03b1 \u03c9\u03b3 \u03b4 (iY |x) ,\n\n(39)\n\nwhich truncate the original system to the one with the Yang-Mills gauge group USp(p)\nor O(p) depending on whether the form \u03c1\u03b1\u03b2 is antisymmetric or symmetric, respectively.\nThe corresponding global HS symmetry algebras are called husp(p|sp(2)[d \u2212 1, 2]) and\nho(p|sp(2)[d \u2212 1, 2]), respectively. In this case all fields of odd spins take values in the\nadjoint representation of the Yang-Mills group while fields of even spins take values in\nthe opposite symmetry second rank tensor representation (i.e., symmetric for O(p) and\nantisymmetric for USp(p)) which contains a singlet. The graviton is always the color\nsinglet. For general p, color spin 2 particles also appear however. Note that this does\nnot contradict to the no-go results of [28] because the theory under consideration does\nnot allow a flat limit with unbroken HS and color spin 2 symmetries. The minimal HS\ntheory is based on the algebra ho(1|sp(2)[n, m]). It describes even spin particles, each in\none copy. (Odd spins do not appear because the adjoint representation of o(1) is trivial.)\n\n5\n\nUnfolded higher spin dynamics\n\nAn efficient approach to HS dynamics consists of reformulation of linear and non-linear\nfield equations in the form of some generalized covariant constancy conditions first at the\nlinear and then at the nonlinear level. This \"unfolded formulation\" originally introduced\nfor the description of 4d HS dynamics in [29] allows one to control simultaneously formal\nconsistency of field equations, gauge symmetries and the invariance under diffeomorphisms. The unfolded formulation treats uniformly higher derivatives of the dynamical\nfields and is just appropriate for the analysis of HS dynamics because HS symmetries mix\nhigher derivatives of the dynamical fields. The same time, the unfolded formulation is\na universal tool applicable to any dynamical system although it may be looking unusual\nfrom the perspective of standard field theory because it operates in terms of infinite dimensional modules which describe all degrees of freedom of the system in question. To\n11\n\n\fillustrate the idea let us recall the unfolded formulation of the Einstein gravity, using the\ncompensator formalism.\nAs explained in section 2, Riemann tensor and torsion tensor are components of the\no(d \u2212 1, 2) field strength (8) RAB = dxn \u2227 dxm Rnm AB . The components of the Riemann\ntensor, that can be nonzero when Einstein equations and zero-torsion constraints are\nsatisfied, belong to the Weyl tensor, i.e. Einstein equations with the cosmological term\ncan be rewritten as\nRA,B\n= EC \u2227 ED C AC,BD ,\n(40)\no.m.s.\n\nAC,BD\n\nwhere C\nis treated as an independent tensor field variable that has the symmetry\nproperties of the window Young tableau\nand describes the Weyl tensor. For our\npurpose it is convenient to use the symmetric basis with C AC,BD = C CA,BD = C AC,DB .\nIn addition, C AC,BD has the following properties\nVA C AB,CD = 0 ,\nCB B,CD = 0 ,\n\nzero-torsion constraint :\nEinstein equations :\n\nC {A1 A2 ,A3 }D = 0 :\n\nBianchi identities for (41) :\n\n(41)\n(42)\n.\n\n(43)\n\nField equations for free totally symmetric integer spin s \u2265 2 massless HS fields in AdSd\n[4] can analogously be rewritten in the form [4]\nA ...As\u22121 ,B1 ...Bs\u22121\n\nR1 1\n\no.m.s.\n\n= E0 As \u2227 E0 Bs C A1 ...As ,B1 ...Bs .\n\n(44)\n\nThe generalized Weyl tensors C A1 ...As ,B1 ...Bs are described by the traceless V A \u2013transversal\ntwo-row rectangular Young tableaux of length s, i.e., VA1 C A1 ...As ,B1 ...Bs = 0, \u03b7A1 A2 C A1 ...As ,B1 ...Bs =\n0 and C {A1 ...As ,As+1}B2 ...Bs = 0. The equation (44) referred to as First On-Mass-Shell Theorem is a consequence of the massless field equations along with the constraints on auxiliary\nand extra fields imposed by requiring appropriate components of HS curvature to vanish\n[4]. Let us note that although the extra fields \u03c9n a1 ...as\u22121 ,b1 ...bt with t \u2265 2 do not contribute\nto the free action, they do contribute at the interaction level. To make such interactions\nmeaningful, one has to express the extra fields in terms of the dynamical ones modulo\npure gauge degrees of freedom. This is achieved by imposing appropriate constraints [4]\ncontained in (44) like the torsion constraint in gravity is contained in (40).\nThe Bianchi identities D0 (R1 ) = 0 along with the equation (44) impose some differential restrictions on the generalized Weyl tensor C A1 ...As ,B1 ...Bs . The trick is to denote the\ncomponents of the first derivatives of C A1 ...As ,B1 ...Bs , that are allowed to be non-zero by the\nBianchi identities, by a new tensor field C1 , writing symbolically D0L C = E0 \u2227 C1 , where\nD0L is the Lorentz derivative and E0 is the AdS frame 1-form. The Bianchi identities\nfor this equation impose differential conditions on C1 to be written as D0L C1 = E0 \u2227 C2 ,\netc. It turns out that the full set of the 0-forms Ci consists of all two-row traceless\nV A \u2212transversal Young tableaux C A1 ...Au ,B1 ...Bs with the second row of length s, i.e.,\nVA1 C A1 ...Au ,B1 ...Bs = 0 ,\n\n\u03b7A1 A2 C A1 ...Au ,B1 ...Bs = 0 ,\n\nC {A1 ...Au ,Au+1}B2 ...Bs = 0 .\n\n(45)\n\nThe fields C A1 ...Au ,B1 ...Bs form a basis of the space of on-mass-shell nontrivial derivatives\nof order u \u2212 s of the spin s generalized Weyl tensor C A1 ...As ,B1 ...Bs . The full set of the\n12\n\n\fcompatibility conditions of the equations (44) can be written in the form of the covariant\nconstancy condition [22]\nD\u03030 C A1 ...Au ,B1 ...Bs = 0\n\nu \u2265 s,\n\n(46)\n\nwhere D\u03030 is the o(d \u2212 1, 2) covariant derivative in the so called twisted adjoint representation.\nTo define the twisted adjoint representation it is useful to observe that the set of fields\nA1 ...Au ,B1 ...Bs\nC\nsatisfying (45) spans the space isomorphic to the space of star-product functions C(Y |x) satisfying (31) and with the ideal I factored out to impose the tracelessness\ncondition. Then D\u03030 is [22]\nD\u03030 = D0L \u2212 2\u039bE0A V B\n\n\u0010\n\n\u22a5\n\n\u0011\n\u2202\n1\nYAi k YBi \u2212 \u03b5ji \u22a5 Aj k Bi ,\n4 \u2202 Y \u2202 Y\n\n(47)\n\nwhere the Lorentz covariant derivative is D0L = d + \u03c90L AB \u22a5 YAi \u2202 \u22a5\u2202Y B and we use notations\ni\n\nk A\n\u22a5 A\nAA\ni = Ai + Ai ,\n\nk\n\nAA\ni =\n\n1 A\nV VB AB\ni ,\n2\nV\n\n\u22a5\n\nA\nAA\ni = Ai \u2212\n\n1 A\nV VB AB\ni\n2\nV\n\n(48)\n\nfor any vector AA . The twisted adjoint covariant derivative (47) commutes with the operator N tw = \u22a5 YiA \u2202 \u22a5\u2202Y A \u2212 k YiA \u2202 k\u2202Y A . This means that the equation (46) decomposes into\ni\ni\nindependent subsystems for the sets of fields satisfying N tw C = 2sC with various integers\ns \u2265 0 (the eigenvalues of the operator N tw are non-negative on the space of o(d \u2212 1, 2)\ntensors with the symmetry property of a two-row rectangular Young tableau because having more than a half of vector indices aligned along V A would imply symmetrization over\nmore than a half of indices, thus giving zero). Different Lorentz irreducible components of\nthe field C(Y |x) with some fixed s just give the set of components C A1 ...Au ,B1 ...Bs satisfying\n(45) with u \u2212 s being a number of indices of the length u two-row traceless rectangular\ntableau, contracted with the compensator V A . Note that any spin s submodule of the\ntwisted adjoint o(d \u2212 1, 2) module, where the 0-forms C take their values, is infinite dimensional. This is expected because the components C parametrize all gauge invariant\ncombinations of on-mass-shell non-zero derivatives of the higher spin fields.\nEquations (44) and (46) were originally derived [4, 5] by the equivalent reformulation\n(unfolding) of the free equations of motion of totally symmetric massless fields of all\ninteger spins s \u2265 2 in AdSd supplemented with some constraints which express an infinite\nset of auxiliary variables via higher derivatives of the dynamical fields. However, the\nequation of motion of a massless scalar coincide [30] with the s = 0 sector of equation\n(46). Analogously, equation (46) with s = 1 imposes the Maxwell equations on the spin\n1 potential (1-form) \u03c9 on the left hand side of (44).\nThus, the equations (44) and (46) give an equivalent form of bosonic symmetric massless fields of all spins in AdSd for any d. We call this important fact Central On-Mass-Shell\nTheorem. It is of key importance in many respects and, in particular, for the analysis of\ninteractions. Central On-Mass-Shell theorem can be formulated in the following compact\nform\n1\n\u22022\nR1 (k Y, \u22a5 Y |x) = E0A \u2227 E0B\n\u03b5 C(0, \u22a5 Y |x) ,\n(49)\nB ij\nA\n2\n\u2202Yi \u2202Yj\n13\n\n\fD\u03030 (C) = 0 ,\n\n(50)\n\nwhere R1 = d\u03c9 + \u03c90 \u2217 \u03c9 + \u03c9 \u2217 \u03c90 , D\u03030 (C) = dC + \u03c90 \u2217 C \u2212 C \u2217 \u03c9\u03030 and \u03c90 = \u03c90AB (x)TAB (Y )\nwhere \u03c90AB (x) satisfies (10) to describe the (A)dSd background, and tilde denotes the\nV -reflection automorphism, i.e., \u03c9\u03030 (Y |x) = \u03c90 (\u1ef8 |x) = \u03c90 (\u22a5 Y \u2212 k Y |x). The V -transversal\ncomponents of the expansion of the 0-forms C(0, \u22a5 Y ) on the r.h.s. of (49) in powers of\nYiA give rise to HS Weyl 0-forms C a1 ...as ,b1 ...bs on the r.h.s. of (44). The key fact is that,\nas one can readily see, the equations (49) and (50) are consistent, i.e., the application of\nthe covariant derivative to the l.h.s. of (49) and (50) does not lead to new conditions.\n\n6\n\nNonlinear higher spin classical dynamics\n\nThe problem is to find a nonlinear deformation of the equations (49) and (50) in which\nthe linearized curvature and covariant derivative are replaced with the full ones with\n\u03c9 = \u03c90 + \u03c91 where \u03c90 describes the background AdSd space-time and \u03c91 describes the\ndynamical HS gauge fields. According to the general analysis of [29], where the 4d case\nwas considered, any deformation, formulated using the exterior algebra formalism, that\nis consistent with the Bianchi identities, describes gauge invariant interactions and is\ninvariant under diffeomorphisms. Here we formulate following [22] a system of equations\nwhich generates all nonlinear corrections to the equations (49) and (50). Before going into\ntechnical details let us stress that the solution we have found gives a deformation which is\nunique modulo field redefinitions. This means that all dimensionless coupling constants\ncan be rescaled away in the classical HS model like the dimensionless Yang-Mills constant\nd\u22122\ng 2 = |\u039b| 2 \u03ba2 in the classical pure Yang-Mills theory. The only nontrivial ambiguity that\nremains is to consider HS theories with different HS algebras corresponding to different\nYang-Mills groups according to the classification of section 4.\nRoughly speaking, the idea is to describe complicated nonlinear corrections to HS\nequations as a solution of some simple differential type equations with respect to additional variables. To this end we double a number of oscillators by introducing additional\nvariables ZiA . The full system of equations is formulated in terms of the fields W (Z, Y |x),\nB(Z, Y |x) and S(Z, Y |x), where B(Z, Y |x) is a 0-form while W (Z, Y |x) = dxn Wn (Z, Y |x)\nand S(Z, Y |x) = dZiA SAi (Z, Y |x) are connection 1-forms in space-time and auxiliary ZiA directions, respectively. The fields \u03c9 and C are identified with the \"initial data\" for the evolution in Z variables as follows \u03c9(Y |x) = W (0, Y |x), C(Y |x) = B(0, Y |x). The Z - connection S will be determined in terms of B modulo gauge ambiguity. The differentials satisfy the standard anticommutation relations dxn dxm = \u2212dxm dxn , dZiA dZjB = \u2212dZjB dZiA ,\ndxn dZjB = \u2212dZjB dxn and commute to all other variables (from now on we discard the\nwedge symbol).\nThe space of functions f (Z, Y ) is endowed with the star product\n(f \u2217 g)(Z, Y ) =\n\n1\n\u03c0 2(d+1)\n\nZ\n\ndSdT f (Z + S, Y + S)g(Z \u2212 T, Y + T ) exp \u22122SiA TAi ,\n\n(51)\n\nwhich is associative, normalized so that 1\u2217f = f \u22171 = f and gives rise to the commutation\nrelations [YiA , YjB ]\u2217 = \u03b5ij \u03b7 AB , [ZiA , ZjB ]\u2217 = \u2212\u03b5ij \u03b7 AB , [YiA , ZjB ]\u2217 = 0. The star product (51)\n14\n\n\fdescribes a normal-ordered basis in A2(n+m) with respect to creation and annihilation\noperators Z \u2212 Y and Y + Z, respectively.\nImportant property of the star product (51) is that it admits the inner Klein operator\nK = exp \u22122zi y i ,\n\n1\nyi = \u221a VB YiB ,\nV2\n\n1\nzi = \u221a VB ZiB ,\nV2\n\n(52)\n\nwhich has the properties\nK \u2217 f = f \u0303 \u2217 K ,\n\nK \u2217K = 1,\n\n(53)\n\nwhere f \u0303(Z, Y ) = f (Z\u0303, \u1ef8 ) with \u00c3A = \u22a5 AA \u2212 k A\u22a5 for AA = Z A , Y A . . ..\nThe full nonlinear system of HS equations is [22]\ndW + W \u2217 W = 0 ,\n\ndS + W \u2217 S + S \u2217 W = 0 ,\n\ndB + W \u2217 B \u2212 B \u2217 W\u0303 = 0 , (54)\n\n1\nS \u2217 B = B \u2217 S\u0303 ,\n(55)\nS \u2217 S = \u2212 (dZiA dZAi + 4\u039b\u22121 dzi dz i B \u2217 K) ,\n2\n \u0303 Z\u0303, \u1ef8 ) and dzi = \u221a1 VB dZ B . In terms of a noncommutative\nwhere S\u0303(dZ, Z, Y ) = S(dZ,\ni\nV2\nconnection W = d + W + S the system (54), (55) reads\n1\nW \u2217 W = \u2212 (dZiA dZAi + 4\u039b\u22121 dzi dz i B \u2217 K) ,\n2\n\nW \u2217 B = B \u2217 W\u0303 .\n\n(56)\n\nWe see that dzi dz i B \u2217 K is the only nonzero component of the noncommutative curvature.\nThe B-dependent part of the equation (55) is responsible for interactions. Note that B has\ndimension cm\u22122 to match the Central On-Mass-Shell theorem (49) upon identification of\nB with C in the lowest order, i.e., \u039b\u22121 B is dimensionless. This form of the nonzero part of\nthe non-commutative curvature manifests that taking the flat limit may be difficult in the\ninteracting theory unless a value of the cosmological constant is shifted by a condensate\nwhich breaks the HS gauge symmetries.\nThe system is formally consistent in the sense that the associativity relations W \u2217 (W \u2217\nW) = (W \u2217 W) \u2217 W and (W \u2217 W) \u2217 B = B \u2217 (W \u2217 W), equivalent to Bianchi identities,\nare respected by the equations (54), (55). The only nontrivial part of the consistency\ncheck is that for the relationship (S \u2217 S) \u2217 S = S \u2217 (S \u2217 S) in the sector of (dzi )3 due to\nthe second term on the r.h.s. of (55) since B \u2217 K commutes to everything except for dzi\nto which it anticommutes by the second equation in (55). However, this does not break\ndown the consistency of the system because (dzi )3 \u2261 0. As a result, the equations (54),\n(55) are consistent as \"differential\" equations with respect to x and Z variables. A related\nstatement is that the equations (54), (55) are invariant under the gauge transformations\n\u03b4W = [\u03b5, W]\u2217 ,\n\n\u03b4B = \u03b5 \u2217 B \u2212 B \u2217 \u03b5\u0303\n\n(57)\n\nwith an arbitrary gauge parameter \u03b5(Z, Y |x).\nTo analyze the equations (54), (55) perturbatively one sets W = W0 + W1 , S = S0 + S1\nand B = B0 +B1 with the vacuum solution B0 = 0, S0 = dZiA ZAi and W0 = 21 \u03c90AB (x)YAi YiB ,\nwhere \u03c90AB (x) satisfies the zero curvature conditions to describe (A)dSd . As shown in [22],\n15\n\n\fthe nontrivial part of the system (54), (55) in the lowest order has the form (49), (50).\nThe same time the system (54)-(55) generates all nonlinear corrections to the unfolded\nfree HS equations (49), (50).\nAn intriguing feature of the unfolded formulation of the nonlinear HS equations is that\ntheir nontrivial part (55) has a form of deformed oscillator algebra equivalent [31] to a\ntwo-dimensional fuzzy hyperboloid in the \"auxiliary\" non-commutative space with the\ncoordinates Z, Y . The origin of this fact can be traced back to the condition that the\ntheory must admit unbroken sp(2) symmetry with some nonlinearly deformed generators\ntij satisfying the covariant constancy condition (33) at the nonlinear level to guarantee\nthat the interacting HS theory admits interpretation in terms of the same set of tensor\nfields as the free theory (see [22] for more details). According to [31], from (56) it follows\nthat the radius of the fuzzy hyperboloid is RH 2 (x) \u223c (4\u039b\u22121 B(x) + 1) \u2217 (4\u039b\u22121 B(x) \u2212 3).\nNote that it depends via B on a value of the HS curvature (including the gravitational\none) at a given point x of the space-time base manifold.\n\n7\n\nConclusion\n\nThe main conclusion is that there exists a class of consistent nonlinear HS gauge theories in\nanti-de Sitter space of any dimension. These theories describe totally symmetric bosonic\nfields of all integer spins and are fixed uniquely by the HS gauge symmetry principle\nmodulo the choice of the spin 1 Yang-Mills group which can be U(n), O(n) or Sp(2n).\nGlobal HS symmetries of the most symmetric vacua of HS gauge theories are certain star\nproduct algebras which exhibit usual quantum-mechanical nonlocality in the auxiliary\nnoncommutative spaces. The field equations in the HS gauge theory map this nonlocality\nto space-time nonlocality (i.e., higher derivatives) at the interaction level. The same\ntime the HS gauge theories remain local at the linearized level because the space-time\nsymmetries are realized in terms of bilinears of auxiliary oscillators. Let us note that\nanalogously to the non-commutative geometry framework of string theory, HS theory is\nbased on the associative algebras (i.e., star product and its matrix extension). For this\nreason, in particular, there is no HS model with the spin 1 gauge group SU(n).\nApart from the purely bosonic HS theories described in this report, a class of supersymmetric HS models is known to exist in some particular dimensions which admit twistor\nrealization of the HS algebras in terms of spinor oscillators [21, 32]. (For more details on\nthe supersymmetric HS gauge theories we refer the reader to the reviews [33, 11]). An\ninteresting feature of the HS gauge theories formulated in terms of auxiliary noncommutative twistor space is that at least at the free field level they exhibit higher symmetries\nbeing symplectic extensions of the usual conformal algebras [34, 35, 12]. The formulation\nof HS field equations in the form manifestly invariant under higher symplectic symmetries (e.g., sp(8) for the 4d HS systems) can be given [12] in the generalized space-time\nMM with matrix coordinates X \u03a9\u039b = X \u039b\u03a9 where \u03a9 is spinor index (\u03a9 = 1, . . . 4 for the\n4d case so that the relevant space M4 is ten dimensional). The comment we would like\nto make is that this formulation gives a simple construction for nonlocal, nonlinear conserved currents in free 4d models by using the observation of [36] that conserved currents\nto be integrated over M cycles in MM , which are bilinear in the fundamental HS fields\n16\n\n\fC(X) in MM , are themselves equivalent to the fundamental fields in M2M . This allows\nbuilding conserved currents J2 \u223c (J1 )2 \u223c C 4 to be integrated over 2M cycles in MM , etc.\nFrom the point of view of the original space-time, these conserved currents look nonlocal,\ncontaining double integration\nQ1 =\n\nZ\n\nEM\n\nJ1 (C) ,\n\nQ2 =\n\nZ\n\nE M \u00d7E M\n\nJ2 (C) , . . . ,\n\n(58)\n\nwhere E M is an analog of the Cauchy surface in MM called local Cauchy bundle in [37].\nThus, the formulation of [12, 36] makes it elementary to generate nonlinear nonlocal\nconserved currents for massless fields of all spins by virtue of the extension of Minkowski\nspace-time to MM . One of the interesting problems for the future is to compare the\nstructure of the nonlocal conserved charges resulting from this construction with the\nYangian generators discussed recently in the context of the N = 4 SYM theory in [38].\nFinally, let us list some open problems important for elucidating the structure of HS\ngauge theories in higher dimensions and their possible relationship with string theory.\n\u2022 To develop a theory of mixed symmetry (i.e. neither totally symmetric nor totally\nantisymmetric) HS gauge fields in AdSd . This problem is not completely trivial in\nview of the observation of [39] that not every free mixed symmetry field in Minkowski\nspace allows a smooth deformation to AdSd . The origin of this phenomenon is [40]\nthat some of the HS gauge symmetries of the flat space mixed symmetry fields turn\nout to be broken in the AdS background. This means that the covariant description\nof generic massless fields in AdSd requires separate investigation compared to the\nflat space [15]. A progress in this direction achieved recently in [41, 42, 43] indicates\nthat the general problem has a good chance to be solved soon. The formulation of\n[42] in terms of HS gauge potentials analogous to that used to describe symmetric\nHS fields looks particularly promising from the perspective of elucidating a structure\nof HS algebras underlying HS gauge theories with mixed symmetry fields.\n\u2022 As a nontrivial consistency test, it is instructive to check whether the HS algebras\nadmit unitary representations with the spectra of spins of massless fields equivalent\nto those predicted by the consistent nonlinear field equations (56).\n\u2022 To extend the formulation of the nonlinear HS dynamics to the action level.\n\u2022 To extend the sp(2M) covariant formulation of supersymmetric HS theories to the\nnonlinear level.\n\u2022 To find solutions of HS field equations which break down HS gauge symmetries and\nintroduce a massive parameter m different from\nconstant. This is\n\u0010 the \u0011cosmological\np\n1 \u2202\nnecessary to define a low energy expansion in m \u2202x . Note that the cosmological\n1\n\nconstant \u039b cannot be used for this purpose because the dimensionless operator \u039b\u2212 2 D\nis of order one as a consequence of (3), i.e. an expansion in powers of derivatives in\nAdS space without any other dimensionful parameter m has formal meaning.\n\nAcknowledgement This research was supported in part by grants INTAS No.03-516346, RFBR No.02-02-17067 and LSS No.1578.2003-2.\n17\n\n\fReferences\n[1] C.
