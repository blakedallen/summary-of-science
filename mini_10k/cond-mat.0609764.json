Introduction\nScattering of a particle by a potential is a time-honored problem of quantum mechanics. (Taylor, 1972) It is straightforward to formulate although a microscopic\nderivation of the scattering potential requires very intricate considerations. Most\noften the scattering potential is modelled by some plausible function in real space.\nThis is the route we shall follow here.\nEven though potential scattering is elastic, calculation of the scattered wave\nfunction requires consideration of all virtual states, up to infinitely high energies.\nWhen the scattered wave function is calculated for piecewise constant potentials\nby imposing boundary conditions, the need to include high energy virtual states\nis not apparent. We shall not solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation directly but rather\n177\nc 2006 Springer. Printed in the Netherlands.\n\n\f178\n\nC. T. RIECK, K. SCHARNBERG, S. SCHEFFLER\n\nuse the Green function formalism, because this allows a straightforward generalization to scattering in a metal containing an ensemble of defects, even when\nthe metal goes superconducting. However, in order to check the approximations\nusually made in the application of this formalism we shall revisit the simplest\nproblems of scattering theory and reproduce known results.\nThe driving force behind the study of disorder effects in superconductors\nis the hope that such investigations will give information on the pairing state\nand the pairing interaction. Indeed, qualitative differences are expected between\nconventional and unconventional superconductors, the latter being defined by a\nvanishing Fermi surface average of the order parameter. Potential scattering in\nan anisotropic conventional superconductor would at high enough concentration\nlead to a finite, isotropic gap, while unconventional superconductors are expected\nto acquire midgap states before superconductivity is destroyed. Conventional superconductors show this kind of behavior in the presence of spin-flip scattering.\n(Abrikosov and Gor'kov, 1961) Because of the innate magnetism in high temperature superconductors, nonmagnetic impurities can induce local moments and thus\nblur the seemingly clear distinction between potential and spin-flip scattering.\nHere, we shall assume that we are dealing with d-wave superconductors. Since for\nunconventional superconductors there is no qualitative difference between these\ntwo types of scattering, we shall confine ourselves to the study of potential scattering. Even with this limitation there is a wide range of theoretical predictions\nas regards T c -suppression, density of states, transport properties etc, depending\non the electronic structure, that is assumed, the way disorder is modelled and\ndepending on the analytical and numerical approximations employed. (Atkinson\net al., 2000; Hirschfeld and Atkinson, 2002; Balatsky et al., 2006)\nIn a solid the scattering potential is due to defects of the crystalline lattice\nwhich are distributed more or less randomly over the whole sample. For large\nsystems, an average over defect configurations has to be taken, not only because\nthe problem would be untractable otherwise but also because the defect configuration is unknown and, except at very low temperatures, changes with time.\nThus the problem of treating disorder in solids is usually broken down into two\nparts: scattering off a single defect and averaging with respect to such individual\nscattering events. As model for disorder we shall use an alloy model in which\nsome of the host atoms are randomly replaced by some other kind of atom. Averaging independently with respect to all possible defect positions, which limits\nthe applicability of this theory to small concentration of defects, leads to the\nselfconsistent T -matrix approximation (SCTMA).\nWe shall use the T -matrix equation (Lippmann-Schwinger equation (Taylor,\n1972)) to describe an individual scattering event. This is a two-dimensional Fredholm integral equation of the second kind with a singular kernel. When the scattering potential is so weak that this equation can be solved by iteration up to 2nd\norder (Born approximation), integrals are not actually evaluated but are parame-\n\n\fDISORDER EFFECTS IN d-WAVE SUPERCONDUCTORS\n\n179\n\ntrized through quantities like lifetimes, transport times, and shifts in the chemical\npotential. Then, a detailed knowledge of the potential is necessary only when a\nmicroscopic calculation of these parameters is undertaken. We are interested in\nthe case of strong scatterers, including infinitely high potentials, for which the\nBorn series diverges. The limiting case might seem unphysical but we know from\nelementary quantum mechanics that scattering off a hard sphere is described by\nperfectly well-behaved wave functions. The reason for the wide spread interest in\nthe strong scattering limit is the realisation that in systems with energy gaps strong\nrepulsive potentials might create states inside the gaps. (Joynt, 1997; Balatsky\net al., 2006)\nFrom this T -matrix the local density of states (LDOS) can be obtained. The\nselfenergy of the configuration averaged and hence translationally invariant Green\nfunction is given by a different but closely related quantity which might be called\ngeneralized T -matrix. (Taylor, 1972; Mahan, 1981) The Green function appearing\nin the kernel of the integral equation which determines this generalized T -matrix\ndepends on some arbitrary energy \u03c9. Only when this is set equal to the energy of\nthe scattered particle does one recover the T -matrix known from scattering theory.\nThe non-iterative solution of the two-dimensional integral equation, which\ngives the desired T -matrix, is a formidable problem which we have not yet solved!\nOne frequently used simplification, especially in the theory of superconductivity, is to fix all momentum variables at the Fermi energy except in the Green\nfunction which is the only quantity integrated with respect to energy. (Fermi surface restricted approach) However, this energy integral diverges! This is related to\nthe fact that the real part of the Green function in position space G\u03c9 (r, r\u2032 ) diverges\nfor r\u2032 \u2192 r in two and three dimensions. The divergence can be removed by\ninvoking particle-hole symmetry which eliminates the offensive term, (Flatt\u00e9 and\nByers, 1999; Salkola et al., 1996) by averaging the Green function with respect\nto r \u2032 over a small volume around r, (Flatt\u00e9 and Byers, 1999) or by restricting\nconsideration to a single band of finite width. Omitting the divergent term is\ncentral to the immensely successful quasi-classical theory of superconductivity.\n(Eilenberger, 1968; Larkin and Ovchinnikov, 1969; Serene and Rainer, 1983) The\nquite convincing argument for this approach is that the divergence comes from energies far removed from the Fermi energy were the modifications of the electronic\nstates due to the onset of superconductivity are negligible. So, when differences\nbetween superconducting and normal state properties are calculated one expects\nsuch contributions to cancel. In many cases, however, no such differences are\ncalculated: one does expect the results for the superconducting state to reduce to\ntheir normal state equivalents as T \u2192 T c .\nIn much of the published work, the theory is further simplified by assuming \u03b4function potentials. With this assumption, which has been made by many authors\nincluding ourselves (Hensen et al., 1997), the (generalized) T -matrix equation\nis no longer an integral equation and even for a superconductor the solution is\n\n\f180\n\nC. T. RIECK, K. SCHARNBERG, S. SCHEFFLER\n\ntrivial. Then a variety of interesting results can be derived, most of which are in\nreasonable agreement with experiment. Modelling the scattering potential by a\n\u03b4-function potential actually reduces the complexity of the problem to such an\nextent that it is possible to drop the assumption of scattering events at different\ndefects being independent. (Atkinson et al., 2003) We should note, however, that\naccording to elementary quantum mechanics a \u03b4-function potential in two and\nthree dimensions does not scatter at all.\nEven for defects within the CuO2 -planes it seems rather doubtful that their\neffect is limited to a single site. Defects due to oxygen nonstoichiometry and\ncation disorder, which reside on lattice sites away from the conducting CuO2 planes, are only poorly screened and hence are certainly long ranged. One conceivable consequence of the finite range of the defect potentials is a mitigation\nof the Tc suppression by potential scattering in unconventional superconductors.\nBalian et al.(Balian and Werthamer, 1963) already noted that forward scattering\nwould reduce the deleterious effect of potential scattering on T c , while Foulkes\nand Gyorffy presented a detailed calculation for p-wave superconductors in the\nBorn approximation, showing that it is the transport time that controls the T c suppression. (Foulkes and Gyorffy, 1977) Millis et al. seem to have been the first\nto apply these ideas to d-wave superconductors, again using the Born approximation.(Millis et al., 1988)\nWe tried to generalize the treatment of angle dependent scattering to arbitrarily large potentials, still using the Fermi surface restricted approach so that\nonly one-dimensional integral equations had to be solved. (Rieck et al., 2005)\nAs model potential we used a Gaussian for computational convenience. We shall\nshow below that in the unitary limit the normal state selfenergy calculated within\nthe SCTMA is proportional to the number of scattering channels considered. For\nthe pair breaking parameter a similarly unphysical result is found when the unitary\nlimit is taken.\nIn Section 2 we develop the general theory of potential scattering in a d-wave\nsuperconductor within a continuum description of the electronic structure. In the\nfollowing section we introduce the widely used Fermi surface restricted approximation and calculate the selfenergy and the pair breaking parameter using the\nselfconsistent T -matrix approximation. We show that these results in the strong\nscattering limit must be wrong and deduce from that the inadequacy of the Fermi\nsurface restricted approximation, at least in the context of potential scattering in\na metal. In Section 4 we study scattering off a single impurity and demonstrate\nwhat needs to be done in order to get reliable results.\n\n\fDISORDER EFFECTS IN d-WAVE SUPERCONDUCTORS\n\n181\n\n2. Basic theory\nThe Gor'kov equations for the retarded Green functions describing a weak coupling spin singlett superconductor in the absence of magnetic interactions can be\nwritten in Nambu space as\nZ\n\u0011\n\u0010\nd2 \u03c1\u2206(r, \u03c1)\u03c3\u03021\u011c(\u03c1, r\u2032 ; \u03c9+ )\n\u03c9+ \u03c3\u03020 \u2212 h(r, \u22072 ) \u03c3\u03023 \u011c(r, r\u2032 ; \u03c9+ ) \u2212\n= \u03b4(r \u2212 r\u2032 )\u03c3\u03020\n\n(1)\n\nThe \u03c3\u0302's are Pauli matrices and \u011c is a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix with only two independent elements. Though not strictly necessary, the introduction of a matrix Green function\nproves to be very useful. The Hamiltonian in (1) is given by\nh(r, \u22072 ) = \u2212\n\n1 2\n\u2207 \u2212 \u01ebF + V(r) + Vlattice (r) .\n2\u03bc\n\n(2)\n\nV(r) is a defect potential to be specified later and Vlattice (r) is the periodic lattice\npotential. A complete solution for these Gor'kov equations is not in sight. One\neither uses a nearly free electron model, i.e. essentially ignores Vlattice (r), or one\nuses a localized description requiring numerical calculations on a lattice of finite\nsize. The relation between these two limiting cases will be discussed elsewhere.\nIn an intermediate model some tight-binding dispersion relation leading to a band\nof finite width is introduced, but the difference between plane waves and Bloch\nfunctions is ignored. In this paper we treat the charge carriers as a two-dimensional\n(nearly) free electron gas. The Fermi surface in this model is circular and the\nband width is infinite and without V(r) the system is translationally invariant. In\nparticular, the order parameter in (1) will then depend only on r \u2212 \u03c1, so that (1)\ncan easily be solved by Fourier transformation:\n\u03c9\u03c3\u03020 + \u03b5(k)\u03c3\u03023 + \u2206(k)\u03c3\u03021 X 0i\n=\nG (k, \u03c9+ ) \u03c3\u0302i .\n(3)\n\u011c0 (k; \u03c9+ ) =\n\u03c92+ \u2212 \u03b52 (k) \u2212 \u22062 (k)\ni\n1 2\nTrue to our assumptions we should have \u03b5(k) = 2\u03bc\nk \u2212 \u01ebF with \u03bc some effective\ncarrier mass, but one could also insert any (model) dispersion relation. The order\nparameter \u2206 is assumed to have d-wave symmetry with respect to its dependence\non k. Using the Green function \u011c0 one can rewrite the integro-differential equation (1) as inhomogeneous integral equation. However, the perturbation V(r) affects the off-diagonal elements of \u011c which, via the weak-coupling selfconsistency\nequation, change the order parameter, even when we ignore the possibility that\nthe pairing interaction is modified by the presence of the defect(s). We, therefore,\nwrite the order parameter as\n\n\u2206(r, \u03c1) = \u2206(r \u2212 \u03c1) + \u03b4\u2206(r, \u03c1) .\n\n(4)\n\n\f182\n\nC. T. RIECK, K. SCHARNBERG, S.

Since the frequency only appears as parameter we have suppressed it for clarity. For an isotropic s-wave superconductor one has \u03b4\u2206(\u03c1\u2032 , \u03c1) =\n\u03b4\u2206(\u03c1) \u03b4(\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1\u2032 ). Then the suppression of the order parameter near a defect does\nnot complicate the problem significantly.\nFor such a (3D) superconductor containing a single spherical impurity, Fetter\n(Fetter, 1965) has calculated the Friedel oscillations of the electron density and the\norder parameter amplitude in the asymptotic regime. The assumption of a zerorange pairing interaction is justified for conventional superconductors because the\nrange of the pairing interaction is certainly much less than the coherence length\nconsidered to be the shortest length relevant for superconductivity. For cuprate\nsuperconductors even this assumption can be called into question because the\ncoherence length is very short and the pairing interaction must have a finite range\nto allow for d-wave pairing. Starting from a weak-coupling version of the spinfluctuation exchange (Dahm et al., 1993) one finds that the pairing interaction\nextends over several lattice constants and hence is comparable with the in-plane\ncoherence length. Friedel oscillations occur on a length scale given by the Fermi\nwavelength. So, both for conventional and for cuprate superconductors the assumption, that the range of the pairing interaction is short compared with the\nlength scale of the defect induced order parameter fluctuations, seems to be hard\nto justify.\nSince in our view there are even more important shortcomings in the description of defects in unconventional superconductors, we shall neglect these order\nparameter fluctuations for the time being. Then Eqs. (5) and (6) reduce to\nZ\n\u011c(r, r\u2032 ; \u03c9) = \u011c0 (r\u2212 r\u2032 ; \u03c9) +\nd2 \u03c1 \u011c0 (r\u2212\u03c1; \u03c9) V(\u03c1)\u03c3\u03023 \u011c(\u03c1, r\u2032 ; \u03c9)\n(7)\nSince we are interested in very strong potentials for which the Born series does\nnot converge, the solution of this equation for general V(\u03c1) is still quite a tall\norder, especially as this (screened) potential ought to be calculated selfconsistently\ntaking into account the Friedel oscillations it induces in the charge density. Again,\nwe neglect this effect and use some model potential.\nThe most popular model is a \u03b4-function potential\nV(\u03c1) = V \u03b4(\u03c1) ,\n\n(8)\n\n\fDISORDER EFFECTS IN d-WAVE SUPERCONDUCTORS\n\n183\n\nbecause for this potential the task of solving (7) is trivial:\n\u0011\u22121\n\u0010\n\u011c(r, r\u2032 ; \u03c9) = \u011c0 (r \u2212 r\u2032 ; \u03c9) + V \u011c0 (r; \u03c9) \u03c3\u03023 \u03c3\u03020 \u2212 V \u011c0 (0; \u03c9) \u03c3\u03023 \u011c0 (\u2212r\u2032 ; \u03c9)\n(9)\nUnless regularized\nas\ndescribed\nin\nthe\nintroduction,\nthe\ndiagonal\ncomponents\nof\nR dD k\n0 (k; \u03c9 ) diverge in two and three dimensions.

This is in accord with the results,\nobtainable by elementary quantum mechanics, for the scattering phase shifts of\nsphere- or disk-shape potentials (see Figs. 3 and 4). When the divergence is removed by hand, \u011c0 (r \u2212 r\u2032 ; \u03c9) no longer solves the original equation of motion\n(1).\nThe order of the divergence can be seen from the explicit forms of the Green's\nfunctions in position space, which are easily calculated using an integral representation for the Hankel function (Watson, 1952), when the order parameter in (3)\nis momentum independent. Since the result for the two-dimensional case is not\nreadily available (Scheffler, 2004), we shall give it here for \u03c9 > 0:\n\u03c9+\nm\n[iJ0 (r\u03a9+ )+iJ0 (r\u03a9\u2212 )\u2212Y0 (r\u03a9+ )+Y0 (r\u03a9\u2212 )] (11)\nG00 (r, \u03c9+ ) = \u2212 q\n4\n\u03c92+ \u2212\u22062\nm\nG03 (r, \u03c9+ ) = \u2212 [iJ0 (r\u03a9+ ) \u2212 iJ0 (r\u03a9\u2212 ) \u2212 Y0 (r\u03a9+ ) \u2212 Y0 (r\u03a9\u2212 )]\n(12)\n4\nq\nwith\n\n\u03a9\u00b1 = k2F \u00b1 2m \u03c92+ \u2212 \u22062\n\n(13)\n\nJ0 and Y0 are Bessel functions of the first and second type. For small argument,\nthe leading term in Y0 (z) is 0.5\u03c0 ln(0.5z). Hence, ReG03 (r, \u03c9+ ) diverges as ln r for\nr \u2192 0, while the divergent terms in G00 cancel.\nIf corresponding expressions were available for d-wave superconductors it\nwould probably be easiest to calculate the local density of states in the vicinity\nof a single defect for given V(\u03c1) directly from (7). Since this is not the case and in\nview of the interest in properties of superconductors containing random ensembles\nof defects, we use an eigenfunction represention for \u011c0 (r\u2212 r\u2032 ; \u03c9) and introduce a\ngeneralized T -matrix to rewrite (7) as:\n\u011c(r, r\u2032 , \u03c9) = \u011c0 (r \u2212 r\u2032 , \u03c9) +\nZ 2 Z 2 \u2032\n\u2032 \u2032\nd k i kr 0\nd k\ne \u011c (k, \u03c9)T\u0302 (k, k\u2032 ; \u03c9)\u011c0 (k\u2032 , \u03c9) e\u2212i k r (14)\n2\n2\n(2\u03c0)\n(2\u03c0)\nT\u0302 (k,\n\nk\u2032 ; \u03c9)\n\n= V(k \u2212\n\nk\u2032 )\u03c3\u03023\n\n+\n\nZ\n\nd2 p\nV(k \u2212 p) \u03c3\u03023 \u011c0 ( p, \u03c9) T\u0302 (p, k\u2032 ; \u03c9)\n(2\u03c0)2\n\n(15)\n\n\f184\n\nC.

We shall show here that some approximations, while leading to seemingly\nreasonable results, cannot be trusted.\n3. Selfconsistent T\u0302 \u2212matrix approximation (SCTMA)\nin the Fermi surface restricted approximation\nIn the quasiclassical approximation, the energy integration is performed assuming\nparticle-hole symmetry. Terms in Eqs. (21) - (24) with \u03b5 + \u03a33 in the numerator, which are responsible for the divergence of the real part of \u011c0 (0; \u03c9), then\nvanish. This quasiclassical approximation is justified (Eilenberger, 1968; Larkin\nand Ovchinnikov, 1969) with the argument that only differences between the superconducting and the normal state need to be considered. In Eqs. (21) - (24),\nsubtracting the corresponding normal state equations does not seem to improve\nthe convergence of the \u03b5-integral.\nIn the present case of a translationally invariant system, the quasiclassical\napproximation reduces to the omission of terms odd in energy, putting momenta\nequal to their values on the Fermi surface (line) except when they appear as argument of \u03b5, and then integrating with respect to the \u03b5-dependence of the Denominator (25).

RESULTS FOR SELFENERGIES AND PAIR BREAKING PARAMETERS\n\nResults for the selfenergies \u03a300 and \u03a301 are shown in Figure (1) for a Gaussian\npotential with \u03b3 = 5. The OP has been taken to be \u2206(T ; \u03c6) = \u2206max (T ) cos 2\u03c6\nwith a low temperature amplitude \u2206max = 16 meV. The exact numerical value is\nof no physical significance here. We focus our attention on the limiting behavior\nfor \u03c9 \u226b \u2206max . In this limit, \u03a30l reduces to the normal state result: \u03a30l = 0 for\nl , 0 because in the system considered, rotational symmetry is broken only by\nthe superconducting order parameter.

For \u03b4-function potentials\nul = 0 for l , 0 and (50) reduces to \u03a300 (\u03c9+ ) = \u2212i \u0393el\nN , which elucidates the\nel\nphysical significance of the parameter \u0393N introduced above. In the Born limit \u03b4 s \u226a\n\u03c0/2, the denominator in (50) can be replaced by 1. The remaining sum is related\nP\n2\nto the Fermi surface average of the squared potential: hv2 (\u03c6)i = hv(\u03c6)i2 \u221e\nl=\u2212\u221e ul .\nFor a Gaussian potential (37) the sum can easily be performed yielding \u03a300 (\u03c9+ ) =\n2\n\u2212i \u0393el\nN I0 (2\u03b3)/I0 (\u03b3). For \u03b3 = 5, the correction factor is 3.8. In the unitary limit\n\u03b4 s = 0.5\u03c0 the sum in (50) diverges because u2l cancels, no matter how small.

Whether the set of ul 's represent a Gaussian or any\nother potential is obviously immaterial for this argument.\nOne might argue that an infinitely high potential is unphysical. However, as\nknown from elementary quantum mechanics, a hard disk or sphere simply presents\na part of space which the particles cannot enter and the difference between a\nlarge and an infinite potential is, in fact, not substantial. In Fig. (1) we also show\nresults for \u03b4 s = 0.49\u03c0. In this case, contributions from terms l > 7 are negligible.\nHowever, the limiting value is still much larger than for point-like scatterers or\nweak scatterers. This appears to be an artefact of the Fermi surface restricted\napproximation, which goes unnoticed when one starts with considering scattering\nonly in very few angular momentum channels.\nThis theory has been used by us to calculate the T c -degradation of an unconventional superconductor with an order parameter of the general form (40)\n(Rieck et al., 2005). In this context one requires \u03a31 (\u03c8, i\u03c9n ) which also diverges\nfor \u03b4 s = \u03c0/2.

Single spherically symmetric impurity in the normal state\nIn order to elucidate the reason for the failure of the Fermi surface restricted\napproach, we investigate scattering off a single spherically symmetric impurity in\nthe normal state.

One\nthus obtains an equation for \u03c8 k (r):\nZ\nik*r\n\u03c8 k (r) = e + d2 \u03c1 G0 (r \u2212 \u03c1; \u03b5(k)) V(\u03c1)\u03c8 k (\u03c1) .\n(54)\nThis equation could, of course, also have been derived directly from the timeindependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\nInserting the plane-wave representation of G0 (r \u2212 \u03c1; \u03b5(k)) and defining a T matrix through\nZ\nT ( p, k) =\n\nd2 r eip*r V(r) \u03c8 k (r) ,\n\n(55)\n\nwe arrive at\n\u03c8 k (r) = e\n\nik*r\n\n+\n\nZ\n\nd2 p ip*r 0\ne \u011c (p, \u03b5(k)) T (p, k)\n(2\u03c0)2\n\n(56)\n\n\fDISORDER EFFECTS IN d-WAVE SUPERCONDUCTORS\n\n191\n\nThe Lippman-Schwinger equation is obtained by multiplying (56) by e\u2212ik*r V(r)\nand then integrating with respect to d2 r:\nZ\n\u0001\nd2 p\n\u2032\n\u2032\nT (k, k ) = v(k \u2212 k ) +\nv(k \u2212 p) G0 p, \u03b5(k\u2032 ) T ( p, k\u2032 )\n(57)\n2\n(2\u03c0)\nThis is identical with (15) when the energy variable \u03c9 in the generalized T -matrix\nis replaced by \u03b5(k) (Mahan, 1981).

Then\nthe T -matrix depends on the moduli of p and k and the angle between them, even\nwhen these vectors belong to different energies.

It seems that one could\nsimplify equation (59) and (60) in the case of very strong potentials, because\nthen the T -matrix on the left hand sides could be neglected.

SCATTERING PHASE SHIFT ANALYSIS\n\nWe want to establish the relations between the Fourier coefficients of the T -matrix\nand the partial scattering phase shifts. These relations put some constraints on\nthe T -matrix on the energy shell which serve as a useful check for the numerical calculations. The desired relations are derived by considering the asymptotic\nbehavior of the scattered wave function (54).\nThe normal state Green function is obtained from G00 (r, \u03c9+ ) + G03 (r, \u03c9+ ) in\nthe limit \u2206 \u2192 0 (Eqs.

For a \u2192 0, \u03b40 and\nhence the T -matrix vanish logarithmically!\n\nthat the potential v(r) is short ranged. Thus, the behavior of the scattered wave\nfunction at large distances from the scattering center is given by:\ni\n\u03bc eikr\n\u03c8 k (r) \u224d eik*r \u2212 i e\u2212 4 \u03c0 \u221a\n(67)\n\u221a T (k\u2032 , k) .\n2\u03c0 kr\np\nThis involves the T -matrix on the energy shell |k\u2032 | = |k | = 2\u03bcE only. Because\nwe started from the retarded\n\u221a Green function, there is only an outgoing cylindrical\nwave. The prefactor 1/ r is required for normalization in two dimensions. Note\nthat this wave function decays even more slowly than in three dimensions which\nrenders the assumption usually made with regard to the independence of scattering\nevents at different defects rather questionable.\nUsing (62), with the asymptotic expansions of the Bessel functions inserted,\nwe expand (67) in a cosine series, which we again write in complex form to save\nspace:\n\n\u221e \u0010\nX\n\u0011\ni\n1\ne\u2212 4 \u03c0\n\u03c8 k (r) \u224d \u221a\n(\u22121)m ie\u2212ikr + (1 \u2212 i\u03bcT m (k, k)) e+ikr eim\u03c6 (68)\n2\u03c0kr\nm=\u2212\u221e\n\nParticle conservation implies that the currents represented by the incoming\nand the outgoing waves should cancel.

The range of ka is\nmuch larger than in Fig. 3.\n\ncan thus be expressed in terms of one real quantity. This provides us with an\nexcellent check for our numerical calculations! Note that no such relation exists\nfor the generalized T -matrix.\nResults for the s-wave scattering phase shift for varying potential strengths\ntan \u03b4 s = \u03c0N v\u0304 are shown in Fig. 3. For disk-shape potentials the change in \u03b40 when\nthe potential strength v\u0304 is increased from some large value to infinity is small. For\nthe Gaussian potential the results are very similar as long as the potential is fairly\nweak. However, \u03b40 increases indefinitely with v\u0304. This is due to the fact that any\npotential with smoothly decreasing tails will be infinite everywhere in space when\nthe maximum goes to infinity. We note that \u03b40 \u2192 0 when the potential range\na goes to zero, no matter how strong the potential. To get resonant scattering\n(2\u03b40 /\u03c0 = 1) one does require a rather large potential, but it will occur only for\nka \u2248 1, i.e. when the wavelength of the scattered particle is comparable with the\nrange of the potential.\nIn Fig. 4 scattering phase shifts for various angular momentum channels are\nshown for a fairly strong potential and a wide range of ka. As expected, \u03b4m goes\nto zero for a \u2192 0 more and more rapidly as m increases. Nonetheless, resonance\noccurs in all m-channels considered, albeit at very different values of ka. For ka \u226b\n1, the scattering phase shifts become almost independent of m!\nResults for the disk-shaped potential shown in these two figures have been\ncalculated from (60) which is very time consuming because integrals have to be\nevaluated to obtain the vm (k\u2032 , k)'s. Our numerical results agree perfectly with\nqaIm\u2032 (qa)Jm (ka) \u2212 kaIm (qa)Jm\u2032 (ka)\ntan \u03b4m (k) = \u2212\nqaI \u2032 (qa)Ym (ka) \u2212 kaIm (qa)Ym\u2032 (ka)\nr m\n4\nwith qa =\ntan \u03b4 s \u2212 (ka)2 \u2265 0 ,\n\u03c0\n\nfor\n\nvmax \u2265\n\nk2\n, (70)\n2\u03bc\n(71)\n\nwhich is derived by solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for r < a and for r > a and\nthen matching the logarithmic derivatives of the wave functions at r = a.\n\n\fDISORDER EFFECTS IN d-WAVE SUPERCONDUCTORS\n\n195\n\nThis comparison shows that it is absolutely essential to keep the principle\nvalue integral in (60). When this is neglected, as is the case in the Fermi surface\nrestricted approach, one immediately finds\ntan \u03b4m (k) = \u03c0Nvm (k, k) \u2264 tan \u03b4 s .\n\n(72)\n\nHence, resonant scattering occurs only for v\u0304 \u2192 \u221e. Now, however, all angular momentum channels become resonant simultaneously. This is not only unphysical, it\nalso causes convergence problems with the Fourier expansion of (58)!\n4.2. RESULTS FOR THE LOCAL DENSITY OF STATES\n\nFrom (60) and (63) we calulated the Green function (53) and, in particular, the Local Density of States (LDOS), which is experimentally accessible through Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (Crommie et al., 1993):\n!\nZ\nk2\nd2 k\n1\n2\n| \u03c8 k (r) | \u03b4 E \u2212\n.\n(73)\nN(r, E) = \u2212 Im G E (r, r) =\n\u03c0\n2\u03bc\n(2\u03c0)2\nThe result is rotationally invariant, as expected. Note that, in order to calculate\nN(r, E) at arbitrary distances from the scattering center, we need T m (p, k) off the\nenergy shell. In the asymtotic regime we can use (68) to calculate the LDOS. For\nthe disk-shaped potential this is almost trivial because we have the analytic results\n(70) for T m (k, k). In Fig. (5) we included results for the LDOS, normalized to the\nbulk DOS N, which are valid only in the asymptotic regime and compare them\nwith one exact result. The most remarkable conclusion, in view of the discussions\nin the literature centered around \u03b4-function scatterers, to be drawn from this figure\nis that nothing exceptional happens when the scattering becomes resonant. This\ncan be attributed to an overdamping of resonant states due to the bulk density of\nstates being finite at all energies. This can be seen more formally from Eq (69)\nbecause this gives\n\u03c0N|T m (k, k)| \u2264 1.\n(74)\nWell-defined resonant states can only be expected inside energy gaps of the bulk\nDOS. It seems to be rather difficult, though, to devise a consistent toy model to\nstudy such effects. (Joynt, 1997) The most appropriate applications that come to\nmind are unconventional superconductors, which we are working on.\nSince we have varied the energy of the scattered particle rather than the potential, the wavelength of these Friedel oscillations changes. Also remarkable\nis the amplitude of these oscillations which is much greater than in three dimensions (Fetter, 1965). The slow decay of the oscillation is related to the twodimensionality of the system considered.\nIn Fig. 6 corresponding exact results are shown for a Gaussian potential. For\nthe same potential strength \u03c0N v\u0304 = 31.82, the results for the two model potentials\n\n\f196\n\nC. T. RIECK, K. SCHARNBERG, S. SCHEFFLER\n\nFigure 5. Local density of states as function of distance for a disk-shaped potential (33) with\nradius a centered at the origin. A very high value \u03c0 N v\u0304 = tan \u03b4 s = 31.82 \u21d4 \u03b4 s = 0.49\u03c0 has been\nassumed for the potential. Some curves have been calculated using the asymptotic expansion (68)\nrather than (63) The values of ka have been chosen such that either s-wave (\u03b40 = 0.5\u03c0) or p-wave\n(\u03b41 = 0.5\u03c0) scattering or neither of them are resonant. For ka = 2.00, exact results can be compared\nwith results obtained using the asymptotic form of the wave function.\n\nFigure 6.\nLocal density of\nstates as function of distance\nfor a Gaussian potential (33)\nwith range a centered at the\norigin.\n\nare very similar. For a very high potential, \u03b4 s = 0.49999\u03c0, the LDOS vanishes\nat distances much larger than the potential range. This is related to the peculiar\nbehavior of the scattering phase shift discussed in connection with Fig. 3.\nThe Green function, and with it N(r, E), could also be obtained from Eqs.\n(14) and (15), where E = \u03c9 + \u01ebF . Then one has to replace \u03b5(k) in (59) by \u03c9 and\nsolve this set of equations for a range of values of this new variable. Introducing\nFourier expansions, integrals with respect to angles in (14) can be done, rendering\nG(r, r, \u03c9) isotropic. We are then left with a double integral, while the calculation\nof the LDOS from (73) only involves a set of one-dimensional integrals. Assuming\n\u03b4-function scatterers, these equations immediately lead back to Eq. (9).\n\n\fDISORDER EFFECTS IN d-WAVE SUPERCONDUCTORS\n\n197\n\n5. Summary\nWe have shown that an approximate treatment of potential scattering in a metal\n(superconductor), which puts momentum variables on the Fermi surface and evaluates the energy-integrated Green function invoking particle-hole symmetry, leads\nto unacceptable results when the potentials have finite ranges. The key problem\nis that in the strong scattering limit results will depend on the number of angular\nmomentum channels taken into account. When only a single scattering channel\n(s-wave scattering, \u03b4-function potential) or very few scattering channels are considered, this problem is not apparent. Except, of course, for the discrepancy that\nelementary quantum mechanics tells us that a \u03b4-function potential does not scatter\nin two dimensions.\nThe only way to obtain acceptable results and to reproduce standard results\nwithin a continuum description is to take all momentum and energy dependencies\naccurately into account. This involves the evaluation of principle value integrals\nand, in the most general cases, the numerical solution of two-dimensional Fredholm integral equations of the second kind. In the strong scattering limit these\ngo over into those of the first kind. However, these cannot be solved numerically\nwithout some regularization. One such regularization consists of reverting back to\nan equation of the second kind. For a disk-shape potential we have shown that the\nresults for a strong potential and an infinite potential do not significantly differ, as\none would expect. For potentials that go to zero continuously, like Gaussians or\nLorentzians, it has turned out to be unphysical to let the height of the potential to\ngo to infinity.\nComparison with alternative approaches based on a localized description of\nthe material is an important project for the future.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge useful discussions with A.
