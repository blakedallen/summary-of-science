At low temperatures, the magnetic and oneparticle spectral properties are in agreement with neutron and photoemission experiments. Our main\nresults are the resistance vs. temperature curves that display the same features observed in BaFe2 As2\ndetwinned single crystals (under uniaxial stress), including a low-temperature anisotropy between\nthe two directions followed by a peak at the magnetic ordering temperature, that qualitatively\nappears related to short-range spin order and concomitant Fermi Surface orbital order.\nPACS numbers:\n\nIntroduction. In early studies of Fe-based superconductors [1], it was widely assumed that Fermi Surface\n(FS) nesting was sufficient to understand the undopedcompounds magnetic order with wavevector Q = (\u03c0,0) [2]\nand the pairing tendencies upon doping.\nNeutron\nscattering reports of spin-incommensurate order [3] are\nin fact compatible with the nesting scenario. However, several recent experimental results cannot be explained by FS nesting, including (i) electronic \"nematic\" tendencies in Ca(Fe1\u2212x Cox )2 As2 [4]; (ii) orbitalindependent superconducting gaps [5] found using laser\nangle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) spectroscopy on\nBaFe2 (As0.65 P0.35 )2 and Ba0.6 K0.4 Fe2 As2 ; and, more importantly for the investigations reported here, (iii) the\nreport of local moments at room temperature (T ) via\nFe X-ray emission spectroscopy [6, 7]. Considering these\nexperiments and others, a better characterization of the\npnictides is that they are in the \"middle\" between the\nweak and strong Coulomb correlation limits [8\u201310]. Because this intermediate Hubbard U range is difficult for\nanalytical approaches, there is interest in the development of simpler models that can be studied via computational techniques to provide insight into such a difficult\ncoupling regime. The Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation\nto the Hubbard model [11] cannot be applied at room\nT since HF approximations only lead to non-interacting\nfermions above the ordering temperature TN , and thus\nthe local moment physics [6] cannot be reproduced [12].\nRecently, a Spin-Fermion (SF) model for the pnictides\nhas been independently proposed by Lv et al. [13] and\nYin et al. [14]. The model, very similar to those widely\ndiscussed for manganites, originally involved itinerant\nelectrons in the xz and yz d-orbitals coupled, via an onsite Hund interaction, to local spins (assumed classical)\nthat represent the magnetic moment of the rest of the Fe\norbitals (considered localized). The Hund interaction is\nsupplemented by a nearest-neighbor (NN) and next-NN\n\n(NNN) classical Heisenberg spin-spin interaction. This\nSF model has interesting features that makes it qualitatively suitable for the pnictides, particularly since by\nconstruction the model has itinerant electrons in interaction with local moments [6, 7] at all temperatures.\nPhenomenological SF models have been proposed before for underdoped cuprates, with itinerant fermions\nrepresenting carriers locally coupled to classical spins representing the antiferromagnetic order parameter. These\ninvestigations unveiled stripe tendencies [15], ARPES\nand optical conductivity results [16] similar to experiments, and even the dominance of the d-wave channel in\npairing [17]. Thus, it is natural to apply now these ideas\nto the Fe superconductors.\nAs remarked already, SF models are also mathematically similar to models used for the manganites [18].\nThen, all the experience accumulated in the study of Mnoxides can be transferred to the analysis of SF models\nfor Fe-superconductors. In particular, one of our main\nobjectives is to study for the first time a SF model for\npnictides employing Monte Carlo (MC) techniques, allowing for an unbiased analysis of its properties. Moreover, to test the model, challenging experimental results will be addressed. It is known that for detwinned\nBa(Fe1\u2212x Cox )2 As2 single crystals, a puzzling transport\nanisotropy has been discovered between the ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) directions [19].\nIn addition, the resistivity vs. T curves display an unexpected peak at TN \u223c130 K, and the presumably weak\neffect of an applied uniaxial stress [19] still causes the\nanisotropy to persist well beyond TN . However, recent\nneutron results suggest that the transport anisotropy\nmay be actually caused by strain effects that induce a\nshift upwards of the tetragonal-orthorhombic and TN\ntransitions [20, 21], as opposed to a spontaneous rotational symmetry-breaking state not induced by magnetism or lattice effects. Then, theoretical guidance is\n\n\f2\nneeded. While the low-T anisotropy was already explained as caused by the coupling between the spins and\norbitals in the Q=(\u03c0, 0) state [22], the full transport\ncurves at finite T define a challenge that will be here\naddressed for the nontrivial undoped case.\nModel and Method. The SF model [13, 14] is given by\nHSF = HHopp + HHund + HHeis .\n\n(1)\n\nThe first term HHopp describes the Fe-Fe hopping of itinerant electrons. To better reproduce the band structure of pnictides [1], three d-orbitals (xz, yz, xy) will\nbe used instead of two. The full expression for HHopp\nis cumbersome to reproduce here, but it is sufficient for\nthe readers to consult Eqs.(1-3) and Table I of Ref. 23\nfor the mathematical form and the actual values of\nthe hoppings in eV's. The density of relevance used\nhere is n=4/3\nP [23]. The Hund interaction is simply\nHHund =\u2212JH i\u03b1 Si * s\u03b1 i , with Si the classical spin at site\ni (|Si |=1), and s\u03b1 i the itinerant-fermion spin of orbital\n\u03b1 [24]. The last term HHeis contains the spin-spin\ninteracP\ntion among the localized spins HHeis =JNN hiji Si * Sj +\nP\nJNNN hhimii Si * Sm , where hi (hhii) denotes NN (NNN)\ncouplings. The particular ratio JNNN /JNN =2/3 was used\nin all the results below, leading to (\u03c0, 0)/(0, \u03c0) magnetism [25]. Any other ratio JNNN /JNN larger than 1/2\nwould have been equally suitable for our purposes.\nThe well-known Monte Carlo (MC) technique for SF\nmodels [18] will be here used to study HSF at any T .\nIn this technique, the acceptance-rejection MC steps are\ncarried out in the classical spins, while at each step a\nfull diagonalization of the fermionic sector (hopping plus\non-site Hund terms) for fixed classical spins is performed\nvia library subroutines in order to calculate the energy\nof that spin configuration. These frequent diagonalizations render the technique CPU-time demanding. The\nsimulation is run on a finite 8\u00d78 cluster with periodic\nboundary conditions (PBC) and uses the full HSF model\nfor the MC time evolution and generation of equilibrated\nconfigurations for the classical spins at a fixed T [26].\nHowever, for the MC measurements those equilibrated\nconfigurations are assumed replicated in space but differing by a phase factor such that a better resolution\nis reached with regards to the momentum k. Since a\nlarger lattice with more eigenstates gives a more continuous distribution of eigenenergies, the procedure then\nreduces finite-size effects in the measurements. This wellknown method is often referred to as \"Twisted\" Boundary Conditions (TBC) [27]. In practice, phases \u03a6 are\nadded to the hopping amplitudes, schematically denoted\nas \"t\", at the boundary via tT BC =ei\u03a6 t, with \u03a6=2\u03c0m/M\n(m=0,1,...,M \u2212 1) such that the number of possible momenta in the x or y directions becomes L=8\u00d7M .\nResults.

Since a ratio JNNN /JNN >1/2 is \"frustrating\", finding Q-order at JH =0 is not surprising, but\nFig. 1 shows that this order remains stable turning on JH\nin the range investigated, as opposed to inducing transitions to other states. The chosen value of JNN in Fig. 1(a)\nleads to a TN similar to that in BaFe2 As2 . The lowT orbitally-resolved electronic density-of-states (DOS) is\nin Fig. 1(b). The Q magnetic order opens a pseudogap\n(PG) in the yz orbital, while the others are not much\naffected. This PG generation was previously discussed\nwhen contrasting theory and ARPES experiments [28]\nand it should not be confused with long-range orbitalorder, that in this SF model occurs at JH \u223c0.4 or larger.\nFigure 1(c) contains the evolution of the 8\u00d78-cluster\nresistance R increasing the number of momenta via the\nTBC, calculated via standard procedures [18, 29]. While\nthe ratio of R's along the FM and AFM directions is always > 1, i.e. qualitatively correct, TBC with L=256\nis needed to reach stable values. In addition, the occupation of the three\nR orbitals at the FS (Fig. 1(d)) was\ndefined as n(\u03bc)= d\u000fn(\u000f)\u03b2e\u03b2(\u000f\u2212\u03bc) /(1 + e\u03b2(\u000f\u2212\u03bc) )2 , involving the \u03bc-derivative of the fermionic population. As T\nincreases and the Q order weakens, the xz-yz orbitals\npopulations converge to the same values.\nThe results of Fig. 1, and others below, were obtained\nintroducing a \"small\" explicit asymmetry along the x and\n\u03b1\ny axes for JNN , namely a generalized JNN\n(\u03b1=x, y) was\n\n\f3\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\nTN\n\nR\n\n\u03c7S\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\nRFM\nRAF\nRandom\n\n0.2\nFIG. 2: (color online) A(k, \u03c9) at \u03c9=\u03bc (TBC 8\u00d78 L=512).\nThe model used (see Ref. 23) includes the staggered As modulation out of the FeAs layer. Thus, our results are in the\nfolded Brillouin zone convention, and for this reason two electron pockets (as opposed to just one) are centered at X in\nthe panels above. The pocket elongated vertically at X would\ncorresponds to a pocket at Y in the unfolded convention if\nthe As modulation is considered via a quasicrystal momentum [23]. (a-c) are for JH =0.1 eV.

Its purpose is to mimic the orthorhombic distortion\nand strain effects [2, 20, 21] and judge if the present calculations reproduce transport experiments [19\u201321]. Cony\nx\n/JNN\n. Using the dependence of\nsider the ratio rNN =JNN\nthe hopping amplitudes with the distance u between dand p-orbitals i.e. tpd \u223c1/u7/2 [30], the angles involved\nin the Fe-As-Fe bonds, the low-T lattice parameters [2],\nfourth-order perturbation in the hoppings for the Fe-Fe\nsuperexchange, and, more importantly, neglecting contributions of the yz orbital that is suppressed at the\nFermi level [28] as long as (\u03c0, 0) spin fluctuations dominate leads to a crude estimation rNN \u223c1.4. Since this is\nlikely an upper bound, the ratio used in our MC simulation rNN \u223c1.14, assumed to be temperature independent,\nis reasonable. Other crude estimations including the direct Fe-Fe hoppings [30] or employing the lattice parameters under pressure [20] lead to similar ratios. Then, our\nasymmetry value is qualitatively realistic.\nPrevious investigations [11] showed that the T =0 HF\napproximation to the undoped multiorbital Hubbard\nmodel can reproduce neutron diffraction results and\nARPES data. A similar degree of accuracy should be\nexpected from any reasonable model for the pnictides,\nincluding HSF . To test this assumption, the one-particle\nspectral function A(k, \u03c9) was calculated, and the FS at\ndifferent T 's is shown in Fig. 2, contrasted against the\nlow-T fermionic non-interacting limit JH =0.

Thus, the\nSF model studied here passes the low-T ARPES test. As\nT increases, at or well above TN (Figs. 2(b) and (c)) the\nxz and yz differences are reduced and rotational invariance is recovered, albeit with a FS broader than in the\nnon-interacting low-T limit (Fig. 2(d)).\nR vs. T curves. Our most important result is the T\ndependence of R along the two axes, shown in Fig. 3. It\nis visually clear that these results are similar to the transport data of Ref. 19, particularly after realizing that lattice effects, that cause the continuous raise of R with T in\nthe experiments, are not incorporated in the SF model.\nA clear difference exists between the FM and AFM directions at low T , induced by the (\u03c0, 0) magnetic order that\nbreaks spontaneously rotational invariance. At low T ,\nthis difference was understood in the Hubbard-model HF\napproximation [22] based on the reduction of the yz orbital population (Fig. 1(d)). This explanation is equally\nvalid in the SF model, and at low T the SF model and the\nHubbard model, when treated via the HF approximation,\nlead to similar physics.\nThe most interesting result in Fig. 3 is the development of a peak at TN , and the subsequent slow convergence of R toward similar values along both directions\nwith further increasing T (as already discussed, to model\nbetter the effect of uniaxial stress [19], a weak symmetry-\n\n\f4\n\n2.0\n\nTN\n\nR\n1.5\n\nyz\n\n2.0\n\nRFM\nRAF\n\n\u03c7S\n\nRandom\n\n1.5\n\nxz\n\n\u03c7S(\u03c0,0)\n5\u03c7S(0,\u03c0)\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n(a)\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n(b)\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n50 100 150 200 250 300 350\n\n0.0\n\nT (K)\nFIG. 4: (color online) Resistance R calculated using a L=64\nTBC 16\u00d716 cluster, with JNN =0.032 (0.028) along the x (y)\naxis. The spin configurations are generated via HHeis , while\nthe R measurements use the full HSF , at JH =0.1 eV. The rest\nof the notation is as in Fig. 3.\n\nbreaking difference between the NN Heisenberg couplings\nalong x and y was included). To our knowledge, this is\nthe first time that the full R vs. T curve is successfully\nreproduced via computational studies.\nA study as in Fig. 3 using a larger cluster, e.g. 16\u00d716,\nis not practical since the computer time grows like N 4\n(N =number of sites), leading to an effort 256 times\nlarger. However, results as in Fig. 1(a) indicate that\nthe classical spins configurations generated merely by\nthe spin-spin interaction could be qualitatively similar\nto those generated by the full SF model, as long as JH\ndoes not push the system into a new phase. Thus, the\nMC evolution could be carried out with HHeis only, while\nmeasurements can still be performed using the full diagonalization of HSF . Such measurements (very CPU-time\nconsuming) must be sufficiently sparsed in the MC evolution to render the process practical. This procedure was\nimplemented on a TBC 16\u00d716 cluster, with L=64 [33].\nThe results for R are in Fig. 4, and they show a remarkable similarity with Fig. 3, and with experiments. Thus,\nthe essence of the R vs. T curves is captured by electrons\nmoving in the spin configurations generated by HHeis .\nSize effects are small in the range analyzed here.\nWhat causes the increase of R upon cooling before TN\nis reached, displaying insulating characteristics? Since\nour results are similar to experiments, an analysis of the\nMC-equilibrated configurations may provide qualitative\ninsight into their origin. In Fig. 5(a), a typical MC configuration of classical spins is shown. The colors at the\nlinks illustrate the relative orientation of the two spins\nat the ends. The (\u03c0, 0) long-range order is lost, but individual spins are not randomly oriented. In fact, the\nstate contains small regions resembling locally either a\n(\u03c0, 0) or (0, \u03c0) order (short-range spin order), and S(q)\nstill displays broad peaks at those two wavevectors. In\n\nFIG. 5: (color online) (a) Typical MC-generated classical spin\nconfiguration on an 8\u00d78 cluster at TN \u223c110 K, JH =0.1 eV, and\nJNN =0.016 (0.014) along the x (y) axis. The red (blue) lines\ndenote AFM (FM) NN correlations, of intensity proportional\nto the width. (b) The dominant orbital at the FS at each site\nfor the configuration used in (a), calculated using n(\u03bc) as in\nFig. 1(d). Red (green) denote the xz (yz) orbital, with a size\nproportional to the density.\n\nstandard mean-field approximations there are no precursors of the magnetic order above TN , but in the SF model\nthere are short-range fluctuations in the same regime.\nStates with \"spin patches\" as in Fig. 5(a) lead to a\nconcomitant patchy orbital order at the FS shown in\nFig. 5(b), where the most populated orbital at \u03bc at\nevery site, either xz or yz, are indicated. The orbital\norientation suggests that the xz (yz) FS population favors transport along the x (y) axis. The patchy order\nshould have a resistance larger than that of a randomlyoriented spin background. This is confirmed by calculating R vs. T in the absence of a guiding Hamiltonian,\ni.e. by generating random spin configurations. The results are in Figs. 3 and 4 (green dashes) and their values\nare indeed below those of the peak resistance at TN of\nthe full SF model, i.e. with configurations as in Fig. 5.\nThen, the effect of strain coupled to short-range spin\nand FS orbital order appears to be the cause of the\npeak in the R vs. T curves [34, 35]. Using a smaller\n(but nonzero) anisotropy, the R-T curves display a concomitantly smaller anisotropy, but still they have a small\npeak at TN (not shown). Thus, the patchy states may\nalso explain the insulating properties of Fe1.05 Te [36] and\n(Tl,K)Fe2\u2212x Se2 [37] above TN .\nConclusions. The Spin-Fermion model for pnictides\nwas here studied with MC techniques. The magnetic\nand ARPES properties of the undoped compounds are\nwell reproduced. Including a small explicit symmetry\nbreaking to account for strain effects, the resistance R\nvs. T curves are qualitatively similar to those observed\nfor BaFe2 As2 [19], including a peak at TN that appears\ncaused by short-range spin and FS orbital order. In our\ncalculations, the anisotropy above TN exists only as long\nas a strain distortion exists, compatible with results for\nannealed BaFe2 As2 samples [38]. This successful application of a SF model paves the way to more demanding\nefforts involving doped systems where anisotropy effects\nare stronger than in the undoped limit [19].\n\n\f5\nAcknowledgment.
