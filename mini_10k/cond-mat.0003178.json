The contention by E.G. Kisvarsanyi and N.S. Sullivan (KS) in\nPhys.Rev.B 48 16557 (1993) as well as in their Reply (ibid. 55 3989 (1997))\nto the Grigor'ev's Comment (Phys.Rev.B 55 3987 (1997)) that \"Pushkarov's\ntheory of phonon scattering fails to fit the data by very large factors\" is\ngroundless and may result from their bad arithmetical error. This means\nthat the phonon-impurity scattering mechanism of diffusion is consistent with\nexperiment and its neglecting by KS makes their results questionable.\n\nThe temperature dependence of the impuriton diffusion coefficient in solid helium can\nbe determined by two types of thermal excitations \u2013 phonons and vacancies. Both of them\nhave been considered in a number of works (see e.g. [1,2]). For low concentrations and temperatures T \u2264 1 K the theory based on the impuriton\u2013phonon scattering has been confirmed\nby the experiment (cf e.g. [1,3,4] and the references therein) and used for determination of\nquasiparticle characteristics. The quantitative agreement was first obtained in Ref. [5] (cf\nalso [6,7]), and since that time the theory has not been subjected to principle changes.\nKisvarsanyi and Sullivan (KS) argue in their work [8] and in their Reply [9] to the\nGrigor'ev's Comment [10] that they have proposed ,,a new theoretical treatment of the\ntemperature dependence of the diffusion of isotopic impurities in solid 4 He\" as well as that my\ntheory of phonon scattering ,,fails to fit the data by very large factors\". The latter assertion\nis very important because it concerns the generally accepted selfconsistent approach to the\ndiffusion in quantum crystals (see e.g. [11,12,5\u20137,13\u201316,1,3,4]). It has been used as the only\nargument to neglect fully the phonon-impurity scattering mechanism, and turn back to the\nvacancy controlled impurity diffusion.\nKS have evaluated in [8] the factor A in the temperature dependence of the diffusion\ncoefficient D = AT \u22129 . They have found A \"to be in the range A \u223c 10\u22124 \u2212 10\u22125 \" while\nmy theoretical prediction [5\u20137,12\u201314] is A \u223c 10\u22127 cm2 s\u22121 K \u22129 and the experimental values\nare A \u2248 10\u22127 (Ref. [1]) or A \u2248 2.4 \u00d7 10\u22127 (Ref. [4]). They concluded that \"the phonon\nscattering is too weak by a factor of at least 100 to explain the observed diffusion\" ( [8],\n\n1 This\n\nComment was sent to the Editor of Phys.Rev.B on 03.12.1998, accepted for publication in\nAugust 1999, but not published till now.\n\n1\n\n\fp. 16579). KS have used in their calculation eqs. (15) and (16) given below as (1) and (2)\nrespectively:\n1\nD = za2 J 2 \u03c4 \u2248 4.3 \u00d7 10\u221215 J 2 \u03c4,\n3\n\"\n\n96\u03c0 9\n\u03c4=\n(6\u03c0 2 )2/3 s2\n5\n\n#\u22121 \u0012\n\n\u0398D\nT\n\n\u00139\n\n\u22121\n\u03c9D\n\u2248 0.79 \u00d7 10\u221217 \u03988D T \u22129\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u0398D is the Debye temperature, \u03c9D = k\u0398D /h\u0304, a = 3.27 \u00d7 10\u22128 cm is the interatomic\ndistance, J is the tunneling frequency and s = 1/3. Hence,\nA = 3.4 \u00d7 10\u221232 J 2 \u03988D\n\n(3)\n\nAlthough these expressions do not exactly coincide with those used in my works they should\ngive a correct order of magnitude for the diffusion coefficient and, in particular, the order of\nA. KS have obtained for \u0398D = 30K and J = 2.5 MHz the value A = 6.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 cm2 s\u22121 T 9\nwhile the right value (obtained by substituting the same numbers into (3)) is A = 1.4\u00d710\u22127 .\nThe issue is not that the above expressions are the most fundamental or give the best value\nof A, but rather that they yield A values consistent with experiment. The value obtained\nby KS and leading to the rejection of the phonon scattering mechanism (cf [8], p. 16579)\nmay come, therefore, from an arithmetical error.\nIn fact, \u0398D = 30 K is the upper limit and corresponds to a molar volume Vm = 19.8\ncm3 while the experimental values cited above are for Vm = 21 cm3 with \u0398D = 26 K\n[17]. This yields A = 0.44 \u00d7 10\u22127 . An ambiguity appears with the notation J = 2.5\nMHz (p. 16579) and J34 /2\u03c0 = 2.3 \u00d7 105 s\u22121 = 0.23 MHz (p. 16580) used for one and\nthe same quantity. I suppose that J is given in rad/s. Otherwise, it should have been\nwritten in the form J/2\u03c0 = 2.5 MHz (as for J34 ) and would be more than 10 times larger\nthan J34 leading to J = 2\u03c02.5 \u00d7 106h\u0304/kB = 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 K and to an energy band width\n\u2206 = 2zJ \u2248 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 K in a drastic disagreement with all known experiments. On the other\nhand the value J34 \u2248 1.10 \u00d7 10\u22125 K is typical of the exchange integral of 3 He atoms in solid\n4\nHe and its substitution into (3) gives the correct order of magnitude for A. Finally, even\nif the unrealistic value J = 2\u03c02.5 \u2248 15.7 MHz were used in (3) the result for A differs from\nthat of KS by more than an order of magnitude.\nIt is clearly seen, therefore, that expressions (1) and (2) (not necessarily the best ones)\nare in agreement with the experimental data. This can be easily verified by substituting\nJ and \u0398D . Therefore, the argument that ,,the diffusion constant calculated for this theory\nfails to fit the experimental data by a factor of 100\" [9] fails. There are no experimental\ndata to require any drastic change of the eqs. (1) and (2).\nIt is not accurate to cite my paper [5] in [8] (Ref.18) as if it were in support to the values\nof A ,,in the range 10\u22124 \u2212 10\u22125 \". The corresponding value is A = 2 \u00d7 10\u22127 as follows from\neqs.(1) and (10) in [5]. It was the first correct evaluation of the impuriton band width. It is\nworth noting in addition that the idea of vacancy controlled mechanism could not be called\nnew because it was considered about 20 years ago (cf e.g. [2]) and was found not satisfactory\n(cf e.g. [1]) to explain the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient.\nAs a consequence, the good fit of the vacancy mechanism reported by KS after neglecting\nthe phonon-impuriton scattering gets at least doubtful. There are also other circumstances\n2\n\n\fwhich call the impurity diffusion description by KS [8] in question, some of them being listed\nin [10] (see also [16]). They will be considered elsewhere.\nI do not concern the problem of impurity diffusion in solid hydrogen as not relevant to\nthe concrete discussion. If the theory of KS does not work well for helium, it obviously\ncannot be a ,,universal theory\" for both quantum solids as argued in [9].\nIn addition, the work of KS [8] suffers from a number of inaccuracies. If the dispersion law\nis defined by their eq.(3), then the energy band width in a simple lattice is \u2206 = 2zJ, not zJ,\nthe circles and the squares in Fig. 1 have to change places, the works of Landesman (their\n[13]) are published in Ann. de Phys. (French), not in Ann. Phys. (N.Y.), the number\n\u0010 \u221a 1/3 in\n\u0011\neq.(5) for the dispersion law in a bcc lattice has to be replaced by 1/2, the term cos 32 kz a0\n\u0010q\n\n\u0011\n\n2\nin (6) has to be replaced by cos\nk a . The correct formulae can be found e.g. in my\n3 z 0\nworks [12,6,15,14]. The problem is not only in misprints \u2013 KS present as their own results\nknown for 25 years. The velocity squared < v 2 >= 18a20 J 2 (eq.(7) in [8]) was calculated\nfirst by Sacco and Widom [18] in 1976, not in their work [19] of 1992 as cited (it is another\nquestion whether it is the right quantity for the problem under consideration). The way of\ncalculation of vacancy-impurity cross-section \u03c30 = 1.40a2 is a secret. Following the references\none sees that one of the authors has made a private communication to herself (Ref.13 in the\nwork of Kisvarsanyi, Runge and Sullivan [20] reads \"K.Runge, private communication\", and\nRef. 14. is an unpublished M.S. Thesis of Kisvarsanyi).\n\n3\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[1] A. R. Allen, M. G. Richards and J. R. Schratter, J. Low Temp. Phys. 47 289 (1982)\n[2] D. P. Locke, J.Low Temp.Phys. 32, 159 (1978)\n[3] V. A.
