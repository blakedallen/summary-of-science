Introduction\nThe existence of smooth framed manifolds of Kervaire invariant one is one of\nthe oldest unresolved issues in differential and algebraic topology. The question\noriginated in the work of Pontryagin in the 1930's. It took a definitive form in the\npaper [41] of Kervaire in which he constructed a combinatorial 10-manifold with no\nsmooth structure, and in the work of Kervaire-Milnor [42] on h-cobordism classes\nM. A. Hill was partially supported by NSF grants DMS-0905160 , DMS-1307896 and the Sloan\nfoundation.\nM. J. Hopkins was partially supported the NSF grant DMS-0906194.\nD. C. Ravenel was partially supported by the NSF grants DMS-1307896 and DMS-0901560.\nAll three authors received support from the DARPA grants HR0011-10-1-0054-DOD35CAP\nand FA9550-07-1-0555.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nof manifolds homeomorphic to a sphere. The question was connected to homotopy\ntheory by Browder in his fundamental paper [13] where he showed that smooth\nframed manifolds of Kervaire invariant one exist only in dimensions of the form\n(2j+1 \u2212 2), and that a manifold exists in that dimension if and only if the class\nj+1\n\nh2j \u2208 Ext2,2\nA\n\n(Z/2, Z/2)\n\nin the E2 -term of the classical Adams spectral represents an element\n\u03b8j \u2208 \u03c02j+1 \u22122 S 0\nin the stable homotopy groups of spheres. The classes h2j for j \u2264 3 represent the\nsquares of the Hopf maps. The element \u03b84 \u2208 \u03c030 S 0 had been observed in existing\ncomputations [56, 52, 60], and was constructed explicitly as a framed manifold by\nJones [39]. The element \u03b85 \u2208 \u03c060 S 0 was constructed by Barratt-Mahowald, and\nBarratt-Jones-Mahowald (see [9] and the discussion therein).\nThe purpose of this paper is to prove the following theorem\nj+1\n\nTheorem 1.1. For j \u2265 7 the class h2j \u2208 Ext2,2\n(Z/2, Z/2) does not represent\nA\nan element of the stable homotopy groups of spheres. In other words, the Kervaire\ninvariant elements \u03b8j do not exist for j \u2265 7.\nSmooth framed manifolds of Kervaire invariant one therefore exist only in dimensions 2, 6, 14, 30, 62, and possibly 126. At the time of writing, our methods\nstill leave open the existence of \u03b86 .\nMany open issues in algebraic and differential topology depend on knowing\nwhether or not the Kervaire invariant one elements \u03b8j exist for j \u2265 6. The following results represent some of the issues now settled by Theorem 1.1. In the\nstatements, the phrase \"exceptional dimensions\" refers to the dimensions 2, 6, 14,\n30, 62, and 126. In all cases the situation in the dimension 126 is unresolved.\nBy Browder's work [13] the results listed below were known when the dimension\nin question was not 2 less than a power of 2. Modulo Browder's result [13] the\nreduction of the statements to Theorem 1.1 can be found in the references cited.\nTheorem 1.2 ([42, 46]). Except in the six exceptional dimensions, every stably\nframed smooth manifold is framed cobordant to a homotopy sphere.\n\u0003\nIn the first five of the exceptional dimensions it is known that not every stably framed manifold is framed cobordant to a homotopy sphere. The situation is\nunresolved in dimension 126.\nTheorem 1.3 ([42]). Let M m be the manifold with boundary constructed by plumbing together two copies of the unit tangent bundle to S 2k+1 (so m = 4k + 2), and\nset \u03a3m\u22121 = \u2202M m . Unless m is one of the six exceptional dimensions, the space\nM m /\u03a3m\u22121 is a triangulable manifold which does not admit any smooth structure,\nand the manifold \u03a3m\u22121 (the Kervaire sphere) is homoemorphic but not diffeomorphic to S m\u22121 .\n\u0003\nIn the first five of the exceptional cases, the Kervaire sphere is known to be\ndiffeomorphic to the ordinary sphere, and the Kervaire manifold can be smoothed.\nTheorem 1.4 ([42, 46]). Let \u0398n be the Kervaire-Milnor group of h-cobordism\nclasses of homotopy n-spheres. Unless (4k + 2) is one of the six exceptional dimensions,\n\u03984k+2 \u2248 \u03c04k+2 S 0\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n3\n\nand\n|\u03984k+1 | = ak \u03c04k+1 S 0 ,\nwhere ak is 1 if k is even, and 2 if k is odd.\nTheorem 1.5 ([8]). Unless n is 1, or one of the six exceptional dimensions, the\nWhitehead square [\u03b9n+1 , \u03b9n+1 ] \u2208 \u03c02n+1 S n+1 is not divisible by 2.\n\u0003\n1.1. Outline of the argument. Our proof builds on the strategy used by the\nthird author in [70] and on the homotopy theoretic refinement developed by the\nsecond author and Haynes Miller (see [73]).\nWe construct a multiplicative cohomology theory \u03a9 and establish the following\nresults:\nTheorem 1.6 (The Detection Theorem). If \u03b8j \u2208 \u03c02j+1 \u22122 S 0 is an element of Kerj+1\nvaire invariant 1, and j > 2, then the \"Hurewicz\" image of \u03b8j in \u03a92\u22122 (pt) is\nnon-zero.\nTheorem 1.7 (The Periodicity Theorem). The cohomology theory \u03a9 is 256-fold\nperiodic: For all X,\n\u03a9\u2217 (X) \u2248 \u03a9\u2217+256 (X).\nTheorem 1.8 (The Gap Theorem). The groups \u03a9i (pt) are zero for 0 < i < 4.\nThese three results easily imply Theorem 1.1. The Periodicity Theorem and the\nGap Theorem imply that the groups \u03a9i (pt) are zero for i \u2261 2 mod 256. By the\nj+1\nDetection Theorem, if \u03b8j exists it has a non-zero Hurewicz image in \u03a92\u22122 (pt).\nBut this latter group is zero if j \u2265 7.\n1.2. The cohomology theory \u03a9. Write Cn for the cyclic group of order n. Our\ncohomology theory \u03a9 is part of a pair (\u03a9, \u03a9O ) analogous to the orthogonal and\nunitary K-theory spectra KO and KU . The role of complex conjugation on KU\nis played by an action of C8 on \u03a9O , and \u03a9 arises as its fixed points. It is better to\nthink of \u03a9O as generalizing Atiyah's C2 -equivariant KR -theory [7], and in fact \u03a9O\nis constructed from the corresponding real bordism spectrum, as we now describe.\nLet M UR be the C2 -equivariant real bordism spectrum of Landweber [43] and\nFujii [24]. Roughly speaking one can think of M UR as describing the cobordism\ntheory of real manifolds, which are stably almost complex manifolds equipped with\na conjugate linear action of C2 , such as the space of complex points of a smooth\nvariety defined over R. A real manifold of real dimension 2n determines a homotopy\nclass of maps\nS n\u03c12 \u2192 M UR\nwhere n\u03c12 is the direct sum of n copies of the real regular representation of C2 , and\nS n\u03c12 is its one point compactification.\nWrite\nM U ((C8 )) = M UR \u2227 M UR \u2227 M UR \u2227 M UR\nfor the C8 -equivariant spectrum gotten by smashing 4 copies of M UR together and\nletting C8 act by\n \u0304 a, b, c).\n(a, b, c, d) 7\u2192 (d,\nVery roughly speaking, M U ((C8)) can be thought of as the cobordism theory of\nstably almost manifolds equipped with a C8 -action, with the property that the\n\n\f4\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nrestriction of the action to C2 \u2282 C8 determines a real structure. If M is a real\nmanifold then M \u00d7 M \u00d7 M \u00d7 M with the C8 -action\n \u0304 a, b, c)\n(a, b, c, d) 7\u2192 (d,\nis an example. A suitable C8 -manifold M of real dimension 8n determines a homotopy class of maps\nS n\u03c18 \u2192 M U ((C8 )) ,\nwhere n\u03c18 is the direct sum of n copies of the real regular representation of C8 , and\nS n\u03c18 is its one point compactification.\nTo define \u03a9 we invert an equivariant analogue\nD : S l\u03c18 \u2192 M U ((C8 ))\nof the Bott periodicity class and form the C8 -equivariant spectrum \u03a9O = D\u22121 M U ((C8 ))\n(in fact l works out to be 19). The cohomology theory \u03a9 is defined to be the homotopy fixed point spectrum of the C8 -action on \u03a9O .\nThere is some flexibility in the choice of D, but it needs to be chosen in order\nthat the Periodicity Theorem holds, and in order that the map from the fixed point\nspectrum of \u03a9O to the homotopy fixed point spectrum be a weak equivalence. It\nalso needs to be chosen in such a way that the Detection Theorem is preserved\n(see Remark 11.14). That such an D can be chosen with these properties is a\nrelatively easy fact, albeit mildly technical. It is specified in Corollary 9.21. It can\nbe described in the form M \u00d7 M \u00d7 M \u00d7 M for a suitable real manifold M , though\nwe do not do so.\n1.3. The Detection Theorem. Since the non-equivariant spectrum \u03a9O underlying \u03a9O is complex orientable, the inclusion of the unit S 0 \u2192 \u03a9 induces a map\nExts,t\nMU\u2217 MU (M U\u2217 , M U\u2217 )\n\u000f\nH s (C8 ; \u03c0t \u03a9O )\n\n=\u21d2\n\n=\u21d2\n\n\u03c0t\u2212s S 0\n\u000f\n\u03c0t\u2212s \u03a9\n\nfrom the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence to the C8 homotopy fixed point spectral sequence for \u03c0\u2217 \u03a9. In \u00a711.3.3 we give an ad hoc construction of this spectral\nsequence, conveniently adapted to describing the map of E2 -terms. It gives the\nhorizontal arrow in the diagram of spectral sequences below.\nAdams-Novikov\nspectral sequence\n/\n\nC8 homotopy\nfixed point\nspectral sequence\n\n\u000f\nClassical Adams\nspectral sequence\nThe Detection Theorem is proved by investigating this diagram, and follows from\na purely algebraic result.\nTheorem 1.9 (Algebraic Detection Theorem). If\nj+1\n\nx \u2208 Ext2,2\nMU\u2217 (MU) (M U\u2217 , M U\u2217 )\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n5\n\nis any element mapping to h2j in the E2 -term of the classical Adams spectral sequence, and j > 2, then the image of x in H 2 (C8 ; \u03c02j+1 \u03a9O ) is nonzero.\nThe restriction j > 2 is not actually necessary, but the other values of j require\nseparate arguments. Since we do not need them, we have chosen to leave them to\nthe interested reader.\nTo deduce the Detection Theorem from the Algebraic Detection Theorem supj+1\npose that \u03b8j : S 2 \u22122 \u2192 S 0 is a map represented by h2j in the classical Adams\nspectral sequence. Then \u03b8j has Adams filtration 0, 1 or 2 in the Adams-Novikov\nspectral sequence, since the Adams filtration can only increase under a map. Since\nboth\nj+1\nj+1\n\u22122\n\u22121\nExt0,2\nand Ext1,2\nMU\u2217 MU (M U\u2217 , M U\u2217 )\nMU\u2217 MU (M U\u2217 , M U\u2217 )\nare zero, the class \u03b8j must be represented in Adams filtration 2 by some element x\nwhich is a permanent cycle. By the Algebraic Detection Theorem, the element x has\na non-trivial image bj \u2208 H 2 (C8 ; \u03c02j+1 \u03a9O ), representing the image of \u03b8j in \u03c02j+1 \u22122 \u03a9.\nIf this image is zero then the class bj must be in the image of the differential\nd2 : H 0 (C8 ; \u03c02j+1 \u22121 \u03a9O ) \u2192 H 2 (C8 ; \u03c02j+1 \u03a9O ).\nBut \u03c0odd \u03a9O = 0, so this cannot happen.\nThe proof of the Algebraic Detection Theorem is given in \u00a711. The method of\nproof is similar to that used in [70], where an analogous result is established at\nprimes greater than 3.\n1.4. The slice filtration and the Gap Theorem. While the Detection Theorem\nand the Periodicity Theorem involve the homotopy fixed point spectral sequence for\n\u03a9, the Gap Theorem results from studying \u03a9O as an honest equivariant spectrum.\nWhat permits the mixing of the two approaches is the following result, which is\npart of Theorem 10.8.\nTheorem 1.10 (Homotopy Fixed Point Theorem). The map from the fixed point\nspectrum of \u03a9O to the homotopy fixed point spectrum of \u03a9O is a weak equivalence.\nIn particular, for all n, the map\n8\n\u03c0nC8 \u03a9O \u2192 \u03c0n \u03a9hC\n= \u03c0n \u03a9\nO\n\nis an isomorphism, in which the symbol \u03c0nC8 \u03a9O denotes the group of equivariant\nhomotopy classes of maps from S n (with the trivial action) to \u03a9O .\nWe study the equivariant homotopy type of \u03a9O using an analogue of the Postnikov tower. We call this tower the slice tower. Versions of it have appeared in\nwork of Dan Dugger [20], Hopkins-Morel (unpublished), Voevodsky[83, 81, 82], and\nHu-Kriz [35].\nThe slice tower is defined for any finite group G. For a subgroup K \u2282 G, let \u03c1K\ndenote its regular representation and write\nb\nm \u2208 Z.\nS(m,\nK) = G+ \u2227 S m\u03c1K\nK\n\nDefinition 1.11. The set of slice cells (for G) is\n\nb\nb\n{S(m,\nK), \u03a3\u22121 S(m,\nK) | m \u2208 Z, K \u2282 G}.\n\nDefinition 1.12. A slice cell Sb is free if it is of the form G+ \u2227 S m for some m. An\nisotropic slice cell is one which is not free.\n\n\f6\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nWe define the dimension of a slice cell Sb by\nb\ndim S(m,\nK) = m|K|\n\nb\ndim \u03a3\u22121 S(m,\nK) = m|K| \u2212 1.\n\nFinally the slice section P n X is constructed by attaching cones on slice cells Sb with\ndim Sb > n to kill all maps Sb \u2192 X with dim Sb > n. There is a natural map\nP n X \u2192 P n\u22121 X\n\nThe n-slice of X is defined to be its homotopy fiber Pnn X.\nIn this way a tower {P n X}, n \u2208 Z is associated to each equivariant spectrum\nX. The homotopy colimit holimn P n X is contractible, and holimn P n X is just X.\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2190\u2212\nThe slice spectral sequence for X is the spectral sequence of the slice tower, relating\n\u03c0\u2217 Pnn X to \u03c0\u2217 X.\nThe key technical result of the whole paper is the following.\nTheorem 1.13 (The Slice Theorem). The C8 -spectrum Pnn M U ((C8 )) is contractible\nif n is odd. If n is even then Pnn M U ((C8)) is weakly equivalent to HZ \u2227 W , where\nHZ is the Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum associated to the constant Mackey functor\nZ, and W is a wedge of isotropic slice cells of dimension n.\nThe Slice Theorem actually holds more generally for the spectra M U ((C2k ))\nformed like M U ((C8 )) , using the smash product of 2k\u22121 copies of M UR . The more\ngeneral statement is Theorem 6.1\nThe Gap Theorem depends on the following result.\nLemma 1.14 (The Cell Lemma). Let G = C2n for some n 6= 0. If Sb is an isotropic\nslice cell of even dimension, then the groups \u03c0kG HZ \u2227 Sb are zero for \u22124 < k < 0.\n\nThis is an easy explicit computation, and reduces to the fact that the orbit space\nS m\u03c1G /G is simply connected, being the suspension of a connected space.\nSince the restriction of \u03c1G to a subgroup K \u2282 G is isomorphic to (|G/K|) \u03c1K\nthere is an equivalence\nS m\u03c1G \u2227 (G+ \u2227 S n\u03c1K ) \u2248 G+ \u2227 S (n+m|G/K|)\u03c1K .\nK\n\nK\n\nIt follows that if Sb is a slice cell of dimension d, then for any m, S m\u03c1G \u2227 Sb is a slice\nb The\ncell of dimension d + m|G|. Moreover, if Sb is isotropic, then so is S m\u03c1G \u2227 S.\nCell Lemma and the Slice Theorem then imply that for any m, the group\n\u03c0iC8 S m\u03c1C8 \u2227 M U ((C8 ))\n\nis zero for \u22124 < i < 0. Since\n\u03c0iC8 \u03a9O = lim \u03c0i S \u2212ml\u03c1C8 M U ((C8 ))\n\u2212\u2192\nthis implies that\n\u03c0iC8 \u03a9O = \u03c0i \u03a9 = 0\nfor \u22124 < i < 0, which is the Gap Theorem.\nThe Periodicity Theorem is proved with a small amount of computation in the\nRO(C8 )-graded slice spectral sequence for \u03a9O . It makes use of the fact that \u03a9O is an\nequivariant commutative ring spectrum. Using the nilpotence machinery of [17, 32]\ninstead of explicit computation, it can be shown that the groups \u03c0\u2217 \u03a9 are periodic\nwith some period which a power of 2. This would be enough to show that only\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n7\n\nfinitely many of the \u03b8j can exist. Some computation is necessary to get the actual\nperiod stated in the Periodicity Theorem.\nAll of the results are fairly easy consequences of the Slice Theorem, which in\nturn reduces to a single computational fact: that the quotient of M U ((C8 )) by the\nanalogue of the \"Lazard ring\" is the Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum HZ associated\nto the constant Mackey functor Z. We call this the Reduction Theorem and its\ngeneralization to C2n appears as Theorem 6.5. It is proved for G = C2 in HuKriz [35], and the analogue in motivic homotopy theory is the main result of the\n(unpublished) work of the second author and Morel mentioned earlier, where it is\nused to identify the Voevodsky slices of M GL. It would be very interesting to find\na proof of Theorem 6.5 along the lines of Quillen's argument in [69].\nDuring the long period between revisions of this paper, Haynes Miller's Bourbaki\ntalk on this material has appeared [64]. We refer the reader there for a incisive\noverview.\n1.5. Summary of the contents. We now turn to a more detailed summary of\nthe contents of this paper. In \u00a72 we recall the basics of equivariant stable homotopy\ntheory, establish many conventions and explain some simple computations. One of\nour main new constructions, introduced in \u00a72.2.3 is the multiplicative norm functor.\nWe merely state our main results about the norm, deferring the details of the proofs\nto the appendices. Another useful technique, the method of twisted monoid rings,\nis described in \u00a72.4. It is used in constructing convenient filtrations of rings, and\nin forming the quotient of an equivariant commutative ring spectrum by a regular\nsequence, in the situation in which the group is acting non-trivially on the sequence.\nSection 4 introduces the slice filtration, and establishes many of its basic properties, including the strong convergence of the slice spectral sequence (Theorem 4.42),\nand an important result on the distribution of groups in the E2 -term (Corollary 4.43). The notions of pure spectra, isotropic spectra, and spectra with cellular slices are introduced in \u00a74.6.2. In these terms, the Slice Theorem states that\nM U ((C2n )) is both pure and isotropic. Most of the material of these first sections\nmakes no restriction on the group G.\nFrom \u00a75 forward we restrict attention to the case in which G is cyclic of order\na power of 2, and we localize all spectra at the prime 2. The spectra M U ((G)) are\nintroduced and some of the basic properties are established. The groundwork is\nlaid for the proof of the Slice Theorem. The Reduction Theorem (Theorem 6.5) is\nstated in \u00a76. The Reduction Theorem is the backbone of the Slice Theorem, and is\nthe only part that is not \"formal\" in the sense that it depends on the outcome of\ncertain computations.\nThe Slice Theorem is also proved in \u00a76, assuming that the Reduction Theorem\nholds. The proof of the Reduction Theorem is in \u00a77. The Gap Theorem in proved\nin \u00a78, the Periodicity theorem in \u00a79. The Homotopy Fixed Point Theorem is proved\nin \u00a710, and the Detection Theorem in \u00a711.\nThe paper concludes with two appendices devoted to foundations of equivariant\nstable homotopy theory. Two factors contribute to the length of this material. One\nis simply the wish to make this paper as self-contained as possible and to collect\nmaterial central to our investigation in one place. The other reason is that our\nmethods rely on multiplicative aspects of equivariant stable homotopy theory that\ndo not appear in the existing literature. Establishing the basic properties of these\nstructures involve details of the foundations and cannot be done at the level of user\n\n\f8\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\ninterface.

Equivariant stable homotopy theory\nWe will work in the category of equivariant orthogonal spectra [54, 53]. In this\nsection we survey some of the main properties of the theory and establish some\nnotation. The definitions, proofs, constructions, and other details are explained in\nAppendices A and B. The reader is also referred to the books of tom Dieck [80, 79],\nand the survey of Greenlees and May [26] for an overview of equivariant stable\nhomotopy theory, and for further references.\nWe set up the basics of equivariant stable homotopy theory in the framework\nof homotopical category in the sense of [21]. A homotopical category is a pair\n(C, W) consisting of a category C and a collection W of morphisms in C called\nweak equivalences containing all identity maps, and satisfying the \"two out of six\nproperty\" that in the situation\nu\n\nv\n\nw\n\n\u2022\u2212\n\u2192\u2022\u2212\n\u2192\u2022\u2212\n\u2192\u2022\nif vu and wv are in W then so are u, v, w, and vwu. Any class W defined as\nthe collection of morphisms u taken to isomorphisms by some fixed functor automatically satisfies this property. This holds in particular when W consists of\nthe weak equivalences in a model category structure. In this situation we will say\nthat the model structure refines the homotopical category structure, and that the\nhomotopical category is completed to a model category structure.\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n9\n\nAssociated to a homotopical category (C, W) is the homotopy category ho C and\nthe functor C \u2192 ho C, characterized uniquely up to unique isomorphism by the\nfollowing universal property: for every category D, and every functor F : C \u2192 D\ntaking the stable weak equivalences as isomorphisms, there is a unique functor\nho C \u2192 D making the diagram\n/ ho C\nC\u2748\n\u2748\u2748\n\u2748\u2748\n\u2748\nF \u2748\u2748 \u000f\n!\nD\ncommute. See \u00a7B.1 for more on the theory of homotopical categories, for a description of the issues that arise when doing homotopy theory in a homotopical category,\nthe techniques for dealing with them, and for an explanation of the notion of left\n(L) and right (R) derived functors appearing in the discussion below.\n2.1. G-spaces. We begin with unstable equivariant homotopy theory. Let G be\na finite group, and T G the topological category of pointed compactly generated,\nweak Hausdorff left G-spaces and spaces of equivariant maps. The category T G\nis a closed symmetric monoidal category under the smash product operation. The\ntensor unit is the 0-sphere S 0 equipped with the trivial G-action.\nWe call a category enriched over T G a G-equivariant topological category. Since\nit is closed monoidal, T G may be regarded as enriched over itself. We denote the\nenriched category by T G . Thus T G is the G-equivariant topological category of\nG-spaces and G-spaces of continuous, not necessarily equivariant maps, on which\nG acts by conjugation. There is an isomorphism\nT G (X, Y ) = T G (X, Y )G .\nSee \u00a7A.1.3 and \u00a7A.2.1 for further background and discussion.\nThe homotopy set (group, for n > 0) \u03c0nH (X) of a pointed G-space is defined for\nH \u2282 G and n \u2265 0 to be the set of H-equivariant homotopy classes of pointed maps\nS n \u2192 X.\nThis is the same as the ordinary homotopy set (group) \u03c0n (X H ) of the space of H\nfixed-points in X.\nA map f : X \u2192 Y in T G is a weak equivalence if for all H \u2282 G the map\nH\nX \u2192 Y H of H-fixed point spaces is an ordinary weak equivalence. Equivalently,\nf : X \u2192 Y is a weak equivalence if for all H \u2282 G and all choices of base point\nx0 \u2208 X H the induced map \u03c0nH (X, x0 ) \u2192 \u03c0nH (Y, f (x0 )) is an isomorphism. Equipped\nwith the weak equivalences, the category underlying T G becomes a homotopical\ncategory. It can be completed to a topological model category in which a fibration is\na map X \u2192 Y which for every H \u2282 G is a Serre fibration on fixed points X H \u2192 Y H .\nThe smash product of G-spaces makes T G into a symmetric monoidal category in\nthe sense of Schwede-Shipley [75, Definition 3.1], and T G into an enriched model\ncategory.\nEvery pointed G-space is weakly equivalent to a G-CW complex constructed\ninductively from the basepoint by attaching equivariant cells of the form G/H \u00d7 Dn\nalong maps from G/H \u00d7 S n\u22121 .\nWe will write both\nho T G (X, Y ) and [X, Y ]G\n\n\f10\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nfor the set of maps from X to Y in the homotopy category of T G . When X is\ncofibrant and Y is fibrant this can be calculated as the set of homotopy classes of\nmaps from X to Y in T G\n[X, Y ]G = \u03c00 T G (X, Y ) = \u03c00G T G (X, Y ).\nWe will make frequent use of finite dimensional real orthogonal representations\nof G. To keep the terminology simple these will be referred to as representations\nof G.\nAn important role is played by the equivariant spheres S V arising as the one point\ncompactification of representations V of G. When V is the trivial representation\nof dimension n, S V is just the n-sphere S n with the trivial G-action. We combine\nthese two notations and write\nn\n\nS V +n = S V \u2295R .\nAssociated to S V is the equivariant homotopy set\n\u03c0VG X = [S V , X]G\ndefined to be the set of homotopy classes of G-equivariant maps from S V to X.\nThe set \u03c0VG X is a group if dim V > 0 and an abelian group if dim V G > 1, where\nV G is the space of G-invariant vectors in V .\nAlso associated to the sphere S V one has the equivariant suspension \u03a3V X =\nV\nS \u2227 X and the equivariant loop space \u03a9V X = T G (S V , X).\nNow suppose that V1 and V2 are two orthogonal representations of G and that\nfor each irreducible representation U of G occurring in V1 one has\n(2.1)\n\ndim homG (U, V2 ) \u2265 dim homG (U, V1 ).\n\nThen one may choose an equivariant linear isometric embedding t : V1 \u2192 V2 and\nform\n(2.2)\n\n\u03c0VG2 \u2212t(V1 ) (X),\n\nin which V2 \u2212t(V1 ) denotes the orthogonal complement of the image of V1 in V2 . The\ngroups (2.2) form a local system over the Stiefel manifold O(V1 , V2 )G of equivariant\nlinear isometric embeddings. If instead of (2.1) the one has V2 > V1 in the sense of\nDefinition 2.3 below, then the Stiefel manifold O(V1 , V2 ) is simply connected and\none may define\n\u03c0VG2 \u2212V2 (X)\nto be the group of global sections of this local system. For any t \u2208 O(V1 , V2 )G the\nrestriction map gives a canonical isomorphism \u03c0VG2 \u2212V2 (X) \u2192 \u03c0VG2 \u2212t(V1 ) (X).\nDefinition 2.3. Let V1 and V2 be two non-zero G-representations. We write V1 <\nV2 if for every irreducible G-representation U ,\ndim homG (U, V1 ) < dim homG (U, V2 ) \u2212 1.\nThis relation makes the set of G-representations into a (large) partially ordered\nset.\nWe will shortly (\u00a72.2.4) be interested in the special case in which V1 is a trivial\nrepresentation of dimension k. As above we will write\n\u03c0VG2 \u2212k (X)\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n11\n\nfor this group. In this way, for any n \u2208 Z there is a well-defined group\n\u03c0VG+n (X)\nprovided dim V G \u2265 \u2212n + 2.\n2.2. Equivariant stable homotopy theory. There is a choice to be made when\nstabilizing equivariant homotopy theory. If one only seeks that fibration sequences\nand cofibration sequences become weakly equivalent, then one stabilizes in the usual\nway, using suspensions by spheres with trivial G-action. But if one wants to have\nSpanier-Whitehead duals of finite G-CW complexes, one needs to stabilize with\nrespect to the spheres S V where V is a finite dimensional representation of G.\nWe will do equivariant stable homotopy theory in the category of equivariant orthogonal spectra, equipped with the stable weak equivalences. In order for this to\nbe considered viable some properties must be established that guarantee computations made with equivariant orthogonal spectra ultimately reduce to computations\nin ho T G in the expected manner. We therefore begin by discussing the equivariant Spanier-Whitehead category, and formulate six properties an equivariant stable\nhomotopy should satisfy in order that it faithfully extend the Spanier-Whitehead\ncategory. These properties aren't enough for all of our purposes, so after establishing them for equivariant orthogonal spectra we turn the more refined structures\n(indexed products, coproducts, and smash products) that we require.\n2.2.1. Spanier-Whitehead stabilization. The G-equivariant Spanier-Whitehead category SWG is the category whose objects are finite pointed G-CW complexes and\nwith maps\n{X, Y }G = lim[S V \u2227 X, S V \u2227 Y ]G ,\n\u2212\u2192\nV\n\nin which the colimit is taken over the partially ordered set of G-representations.\nFor an informative discussion of this category the reader is referred to [5].\nThere is a direct analogue [5, 84] of Spanier-Whitehead duality in SWG , in which\na finite based G-CW complex embedded in a representation sphere S V is \"V -dual\"\nto the unreduced suspension of its complement.\nExample 2.4. Suppose that X is a finite pointed G-set B. If there is an equivariant\nembedding B \u2282 S V (for instance when V is the G-representation with basis B) the\nV -dual of B works out to be S V \u2227 B.\nIf one wants finite G-CW complexes to have actual duals, in the sense of objects in a symmetric monoidal category, then one must enlarge the category SWG\nby formally adding, for each finite G-CW complex Y and each finite dimensional\nrepresentation V of G, an object S \u2212V \u2227 Y defined by\n(2.5)\n\n{X, S \u2212V \u2227 Y }G = {S V \u2227 X, Y }G .\n\nSince {S V \u2227 ( \u2212 ), Y }G is a functor on SWG , this amounts to simply working in an\nenlargement of the Yoneda embedding of SWG . One checks that for any Z, the map\nZ \u2192 S \u2212V \u2227 S V \u2227 Z corresponding to the identity map of S V \u2227 Z under (2.5) is an\nisomorphism, and that symmetric monoidal structure given by the smash product\nextends to this enlarged category. If X and Y are V -duals in SWG , then X and\nS \u2212V \u2227 Y are duals in the enlarged equivariant Spanier-Whitehead category.\nExample 2.6. From Example 2.4, B is self-dual in the enlarged equivariant SpanierWhitehead category.\n\n\f12\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nAs in the non-equivariant case, the equivariant Spanier-Whitehead category still\nsuffers the defect that it is also not quite set up for doing stable homotopy theory. What one wants is a complete closed symmetric monoidal category SG of\nG-equivariant spectra, equipped with the structure of a homotopical category (or\neven a Quillen model category), and related to T G by a pair of adjoint (suspension\nspectrum and zero space) functors\n\u03a3 \u221e : T G \u21c6 SG : \u03a9 \u221e .\nIn order to know that computations made in this category reduce in the expected\nmanner to those in classical stable homotopy theory, one would like this data to\nsatisfy\n\u221e\nSpG\nand \u03a9\u221e induce adjoint functors\n1 The functors \u03a3\n\nL\u03a3\u221e : ho T G \u21c6 ho SG : R\u03a9\u221e .\non the homotopy categories.\nG\nSpG\n2 The symmetric monoidal structure on S induces a closed symmetric monoidal\nstructure on the homotopy category ho SG and the functor L\u03a3\u221e is symmetric monoidal.\n\u221e\nextends to a fully faithful, symmetric monoidal embedSpG\n3 The functor L\u03a3\nG\nding of SW into ho SG .\nV\nSpG\nare invertible in ho SG under the smash product, so in\n4 The objects S\nparticular the above embedding of SWG extends to an embedding of the\nextended Spanier-Whitehead category.\nG\nSpG\n5 Arbitrary coproducts (denoted \u2228) exist in ho S and can be computed by\nthe formation of wedges. If {X\u03b1 } is a collection of objects of SG and K is\na finite G-CW complex, then the map\nM\n_\nho SG (K, X\u03b1 ) \u2192 ho SG (K, X\u03b1 )\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\nis an isomorphism.\nG\nSpG\n6 Up to weak equivalence every object X is presentable in S as a homotopy\ncolimit\n* * * \u2192 S \u2212Vn \u2227 XVn \u2192 S \u2212Vn+1 \u2227 XVn+1 \u2192 * * * ,\nin which {Vn } is a fixed increasing sequence of representations eventually\ncontaining every finite dimensional representation of G, and each XVn is\nweakly equivalent to an object of the form \u03a3\u221e KVn , with KVn a G-CW\ncomplex.\nThese properties aren't meant to constitute a characterization of SG , though\nthey nearly do. The first five insist that SG not be too small, and the last that it\nnot be too big. Combined they show that, any computation one wishes to make in\nho SG can, in principle, be reduced to a computation in SWG .\nIn all of the common models, and in particular in equivariant orthogonal spectra,\nthe presentation SpG\n6 is functorial. We call this the canonical homotopy presentation. It is described in detail in \u00a7B.4.3. For many purposes one can ignore most of\nthe technical details of equivariant spectra, and just think in terms of the canonical\nhomotopy presentation.\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n13\n\nFinally, unless the emphasis is on foundations, we will drop the L and R and\nimplicitly assume that all of the functors have been derived, unless otherwise specified.\n2.2.2. Equivariant orthogonal spectra. An orthogonal G-spectrum consists of a collection of pointed G-spaces XV indexed by the finite dimensional orthogonal representations V of G, an action of the orthogonal group O(V ) (of non-equivariant\nmaps) on XV , and for each (not necessarily G-equivariant) orthogonal inclusion\nt : V \u2282 W a map S W \u2212t(V ) \u2227 XV \u2192 XW , in which W \u2212 t(V ) denotes the orthogonal\ncomplement of the image of V in W . These maps are required to be compatible\nwith the actions of G and O(V ). Maps of equivariant orthogonal spectra are defined\nin the evident manner. For a more careful and detailed description see A.2.4.\nDepending on the context, we will refer to orthogonal G-spectra as \"equivariant\northogonal spectra,\" \"orthogonal spectra,\" \"G-spectra,\" and sometimes just as\n\"spectra\".\nAs with G-spaces, there are two useful ways of making the collection of G-spectra\ninto a category. There is the topological category SG just described, and the Gequivariant topological category SG of equivariant orthogonal spectra and G-spaces\n \u0304\nof non-equivariant maps. Thus for equivariant orthogonal spectra X and Y there\nis an identification\nSG (X, Y ) = SG (X, Y )G .\n \u0304\nWe will use the abbreviated notation S to denote SG when G is the trivial group.\nIf V and W are two orthogonal representations of G the same dimension, and\nO(V, W ) is the G-space of (not necessarily equivariant) orthogonal maps, then\nO(V, W )+ \u2227 XV \u2192 XW\nO(V )\n\nis a G-equivariant homeomorphism. In particular an orthogonal G-spectrum X is\ndetermined by the XV with V a trivial G-representation. This implies that the\ncategory SG is equivalent to the category of objects in S equipped with a G-action\n(Proposition A.19).\nBoth SG and SG are tensored and cotensored over G-spaces:\n \u0304\n(X \u2227 K)V = XV \u2227 K\n\u0001\nX K V = (XV )K .\nBoth categories are complete and cocomplete.\n\nDefinition 2.7.

Change of group and indexed monoidal products. The fact that the category\nSG is equivalent to the category of objects in S equipped with a G-action has an\nimportant and useful consequence. It means that if a construction involving spectra\nhappens to produce something with a G-action, it defines a functor with values in\nG-spectra. For example, if H \u2282 G is a subgroup, there is a restriction functor\ni\u2217H : SG \u2192 SH given by simply restricting the action to H. This functor has both\na left and a right adjoint. The left adjoint is given by\nX 7\u2192 G+ \u2227 X\nH\n\nand may be written as a \"wedge\"\n\n_\n\nXi\n\ni\u2208G/H\n\nwhere Xi = (Hi )+ \u2227 X with Hi \u2282 G the coset indexed by i. Similarly, the right\nH\n\nadjoint is given by the H-fixed points of the internal function spectrum from G to\nX, and may be written as a kind of product\nY\nY\nXi .\nXi \u2248\ni\u2208H\\G\n\ni\n\nH\n\ni\n\ni\u2208G/H\n\ni\n\nwhere X = hom (H , X) and H is the left H-coset with index i. The identification of the two expressions is made using the map g 7\u2192 g \u22121 . There is also an\nanalogous construction involving the smash product\n^\nG\nXi\nNH\nX=\ni\u2208G/H\n\nThese are special cases of a more general construction.\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n15\n\nSuppose that G is a finite group, and J is a finite set on which G acts. Write\nBJ G for the category with object set J, in which a map from j to j \u2032 is an element\ng \u2208 G with g * j = j \u2032 . We abbreviate this to BG in case J = pt.

The group G acts naturally on the indexed wedge and indexed smash\nproduct and so they define functors from the category of BJ G-diagrams of spectra\nto SG . For more details, see \u00a7A.3.2.\nSuppose that H is a subgroup of G and J = G/H. In this case the inclusion\nB{e} H \u2192 BJ G of the full subcategory containing the identity coset is an equivalence. The restriction functor and its left Kan extension therefore give an equivalence of the category of BJ G-diagrams of spectra with SH . Under this equivalence,\nthe indexed wedge works out to be the functor\nG+ \u2227 ( \u2212 ).\nH\n\nThe indexed smash product is the norm functor\nG\nNH\n: SH \u2192 SG ,\n\nsending an H-spectrum X to the G-spectrum\n^\nXj .\nj\u2208G/H\n\nG\nRemark 2.10. When the context is clear, we will sometimes abbreviate the NH\nsimply to N in order to avoid clustering of symbols.\n\nThe norm distributes over wedges in much the same way as the iterated smash\nproduct. A precise statement of the general \"distributive law\" appears in \u00a7A.3.3.\nG\nThe functor NH\nis symmetric monoidal, commutes with sifted colimits, and\nso filtered colimits and reflexive coequalizers (Proposition A.53).

The inequality of Definition 2.3 gives the collection of finite dimensional orthogonal G-representations the structure of a (large)\npartially ordered set. When V1 is the trivial representation of dimension k the\ncondition V2 > V1 means that\ndim V2G > k + 1,\n\n(2.12)\n\nand we will use instead the abbreviation V2 > k.

An increasing sequence Vn \u2282 Vn+1 \u2282 * * * of finite dimensional\nrepresentations of G is exhausting if any finite dimensional representation V of G\nadmits an equivariant embedding in some Vn .\nAny exhausting sequence * * * \u2282 Vn \u2282 Vn+1 \u2282 * * * is final in the poset of Grepresentations, so the map\nlim \u03c0VHn +k XVn \u2192 lim \u03c0VH+k XV\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\nn\n\nV >\u2212k\n\nis an isomorphism.

As with G-spaces, we will often employ the\nnotation\n[X, Y ]G\nfor ho SG (X, Y ). See \u00a7B.1 for more on the theory of homotopical categories, and for\nan explanation of the notion of left (L) and right (R) derived functors appearing\nin the discussion below.\nG\nG\nG\n2.2.5. Properties SpG\n1 -Sp6 . We now describe how properties Sp1 -Sp6 are verified, deferring most of the technical details to Appendix B. The first five properties\nassert things only about the homotopy category and, save the fact that the symmetric monoidal structure is closed, they can be established using only the language\nof homotopical categories.\n\u221e\nFor SpG\npre1 , one checks directly from the definition that the functor \u03a3\nserves weak equivalences between G-spaces with non-degenerate base points, so\nthat L\u03a3\u221e X can be computed as \u03a3\u221e X if X has a non-degenerate base point, or as\n\u03a3\u221e X\u0303 in general, where X\u0303 is formed from X by adding a whisker at the base point.\nThe right derived functor R\u03a9\u221e is given by choosing any exhausting sequence and\nforming\nR\u03a9\u221e X = holim \u03a9Vn XVn\n\u2212\u2192\n(See Proposition B.24). Verifying that L\u03a3\u221e and R\u03a9\u221e are adjoint functors makes\nuse of formula (2.18) below.\nRegarding the symmetric monoidal structure (SpG\n2 ), the smash product is not\nknown to preserve weak equivalences between all objects but it does so on the\nfull subcategory of SG \u00d7 SG consisting of pairs (X, Y ) for which one of X or Y is\ncellular in the sense that it constructed inductively, starting with \u2217 and attaching\nm\ncells of the form G+ \u2227 S \u2212V \u2227 D+\n, with V a representation of H. Every G-spectrum\nH\n\nreceives a functorial weak equivalence from a cellular object, so this is enough to\ninduce a symmetric monoidal smash product on ho SG . See \u00a7B.3.7. The fact that\nthe symmetric monoidal structure is closed is best understood in the context of\nmodel categories. See \u00a7B.4.2, and especially Corollary B.80.\nG\nFor SpG\nin good cases. Choose\n3 , there is a useful formula for maps in ho S\nan exhausting sequence {Vn }. For K a finite G-CW complex, l \u2208 Z, and any\nY \u2208 SG the definition of stable weak equivalence and some elementary facts about\nhomotopical categories lead to the formula (Proposition B.44)\n(2.18)\n\nho SG (S l \u2227 K, Y ) = lim[S Vn +l \u2227 K, YVn ]G ,\n\u2212\u2192\nn\n\nUsing this one easily checks that functor K 7\u2192 S 0 \u2227 K extends to a symmetric monoidal functor SWG \u2192 ho SG .

A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nis a weak equivalence (Proposition B.30). This ultimately implies that S V is invertible in ho SG (Corollary B.48). This establishes SpG\n4 .\nThe fact that the formation of arbitrary wedges preserves weak equivalences\ngives the first part of Property SpG\n5 (Corollary B.23). The second part follows\nfrom (2.18).\nThe canonical homotopy presentation of SpG\n6 is constructed by choosing an\nexhausting sequence V = {Vn } and letting Xn be an equivariant CW approximation\nto XVn . Since it involves more than just the homotopy category, the construction\nis easier to describe with a model category structure in place. For the details see\n\u00a7B.4.3.\nIndexed monoidal products have convenient homotopy properties in SG . The\nformation of indexed wedges is homotopical (Definition B.7), in the sense that it\npreserves weak equivalences. This means that it need not be derived. The same is\ntrue of the formation of finite indexed products. The map\n_\nY\nX\u03b1 \u2192\nX\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\nfrom a finite indexed wedge to a finite indexed product is always a weak equivalence.\nThis means in particular that for H \u2282 G, the map from the left to the right adjoint\nof the restriction functor\nSG \u2192 SH\n\nis always a weak equivalence. Thus for X \u2208 SG and Y \u2208 SH there are isomorphisms\nY\n\u0003G\n\u0002\nYi \u2248 [i\u2217H X, Y ]H .\n(2.20)\n[X, G+ \u2227 Y ]G \u2248 X,\nH\n\ni\u2208G/H\n\nThe composite is the Wirthm\u00fcller isomorphism. Because of it, the right adjoint to\nthe restriction functor tends not to appear explicitly when discussing the homotopy\ncategory.\nUp to weak equivalence, indexed smash products can be computed using cellular approximations. Combining this with the properties of the norm listed in\nG\nX in terms of the canonical homotopy\n\u00a72.2.3 leads to a useful description of NH\npresentation\nG\n\nG\nG\nNH\nX = holim S \u2212 indH Vn \u2227 NH\nXVn .\n\u2212\u2192\nVn\n\nFinally, note that the formula (2.18) also implies that for any k \u2208 Z\n\u03c0kH X \u2248 ho SH (S k , X) \u2248 ho SG (G+ \u2227 S k , X)\nH\n\nk\n\nwhere for k > 0 S \u2212k is defined to be S \u2212R with Rk the trivial representation.\n2.2.6. The model structure. Not all of the functors one wishes to consider have\nconvenient homotopy theoretic properties.\nExample 2.21. For a G-spectrum X let\nSymn X = X \u2227n /\u03a3n\nbe the orbit spectrum of the n-fold iterated smash product by the action of the\nsymmetric group. The map\nS \u22121 \u2227 S 1 \u2192 S 0\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n19\n\nis a weak equivalence. However, the induced map\nSymn (S \u22121 \u2227 S 1 ) \u2192 Symn S 0\nis not. The right side is S 0 since it is the tensor unit, while the left side works out\n(Proposition B.117) to be weakly equivalent to the suspension spectrum of classifying space for G-equivariant principal \u03a3n -bundles, pointed by a disjoint basepoint.\nIn order to go further it is useful to refine the homotopical category structure on\nSG to a model category. Let Acof be the set of maps\n(2.22)\n\nn\u22121\nn\nAcof = {G+ \u2227 S \u2212V \u2227 S+\n\u2192 G+ \u2227 S \u2212V \u2227 D+\n}\nH\n\nH\n\nin which H \u2282 G is a subgroup of G and V is a representation of H containing\na non-zero invariant vector. The set Acof is the set of generating cofibrations in\nthe positive complete model structure on SG . The weak equivalences are the stable\nweak equivalences and the fibrations are the maps having the right lifting property\nagainst the acyclic cofibrations. See \u00a7B.4.1 for more details.\nIt works out that the symmetric power construction is homotopical on the class\nof cofibrant objects in the positive complete model structure (Proposition B.113).\nRemark 2.23. The condition that V contains a non-zero invariant vector is the positivity condition. It is due to Jeff Smith, and arose first in the theory of symmetric\nspectra (see the paragraph following Corollary 0.6 in [54]). The choice is dictated\nby two requirements. One is that symmetric power construction sends weak equivalences between cofibrant objects to weak equivalences. This is the key point in\nshowing that the forgetful functor from commutative algebras in SG to SG creates a\nmodel category structure on commutative algebras in SG (Proposition B.130). The\nother is that the geometric fixed point functor (\u00a7B.10) preserves (acyclic) cofibrations. The first requirement could be met by replacing \"positive\" with dim V > 0.\nThe second requires dim V G > 0, once one is using a positive model structure on\nS.\n2.2.7. Virtual representation spheres and RO(G)-graded cohomology. Using the spectra S \u2212V1 and the spaces S V0 one can associate a stable \"sphere\" to each virtual\nrepresentation V of G. To do so, one first represents V as difference [V0 ] \u2212 [V1 ] of\nrepresentations, and then sets\nS V = S \u2212V1 \u2227 S V0 .\nIf (V0 , V1 ) and (W0 , W1 ) are two pairs of orthogonal representations representing\nthe same virtual representation\nV = [V0 ] \u2212 [V1 ] = [W0 ] \u2212 [W1 ] \u2208 RO(G),\nthen there is a representation U , and an equivariant orthogonal isomorphism\nW1 \u2295 V0 \u2295 U \u2248 V1 \u2295 W0 \u2295 U.\nA choice of such data gives weak equivalences\nS \u2212W1 \u2227 S W0 \u2190 S \u2212W1 \u2295V0 \u2295U \u2227 S W0 \u2295V0 \u2295U\n\u2248 S \u2212V1 \u2295W0 \u2295U \u2227 S W0 \u2295V0 \u2295U \u2192 S \u2212V1 \u2227 S V0\nThus, up to weak equivalence\nS V = S \u2212V1 \u2227 S V0\n\n\f20\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\ndepends only on V . However, the weak equivalence between the spheres arising\nfrom different choices depends on data not specified in the notation. This leads\nto some subtleties in grading equivariant stable homotopy groups over the real\nrepresentation ring RO(G). See [5, \u00a76] and [57, Chapter XIII]. The virtual representation spheres arising in this paper always occur as explicit differences of actual\nrepresentations.\nIn the positive complete model structure, the spectrum S \u2212V1 \u2227 S V0 will be cofibrant if and only if the dimension of the fixed point space V1G is positive.\nDefinition 2.24.

The spectra underlying commutative rings are almost never cofibrant. This means that there is no guarantee that\nthe norm of a commutative ring has the correct homotopy type. The fact that it\ndoes is one of the main results of Appendix B. The following is a consequence of\nProposition B.147.\nProposition 2.30. Suppose that R is a cofibrant commutative H-algebra, and\nR\u0303 \u2192 R is a cofibrant approximation of the underlying H-spectrum.

Other uses of the norm. There are several important constructions derived\nfrom the norm functor which also go by the name of \"the norm.\"\nSuppose that R is a G-equivariant commutative ring spectrum, and X is an\nH-spectrum for a subgroup H \u2282 G. Write\n0\nRH\n(X) = [X, i\u2217H R]H .\n\nThere is a norm map\nG\n0\n0\nG\nNH\n: RH\n(X) \u2192 RG\n(NH\nX)\ndefined by sending an H-equivariant map X \u2192 R to the composite\nG \u2217\nG\nNH\nX \u2192 NH\n(iH R) \u2192 R,\n\nin which the second map is the counit of the restriction-norm adjunction. This\nis the norm map on equivariant spectrum cohomology, and is the form in which\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n23\n\nthe norm is described in Greenlees-May [27]. For an explicit comparison with [27]\nsee [11].\nWhen V is a representation of H and X = S V the above gives a map\nG\nG\nN = NH\n: \u03c0VH R \u2192 \u03c0ind\nVR\n\nin which ind V is the induced representation which we call the norm map on the\nRO(G)-graded homotopy groups of commutative rings\nNow suppose that X is a pointed G-space.

A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\n2.4. The method of twisted monoid rings. In this section we describe the\nmethod of twisted monoid rings. The basic constructions are categorical, and in\n\u00a7\u00a72.4.1-2.4.2 we do not make any homotopy theoretic considerations. In \u00a72.4.3 we\ntake up the homotopy theoretic aspects of our constructions.\n2.4.1. Twisted monoid rings. We start with a subgroup H of G, and a positive\nrepresentative (V0 , V1 ) of a virtual representation V of H. Let\n_\nS 0 [S V ] =\n(S V )\u2227k\nk\u22650\n\nbe the free H-equivariant associative algebra generated by S V = S \u2212V1 \u2227 S V0 , and\nx\u0304 \u2208 \u03c0VH S 0 [S V ]\n\nthe homotopy class of the generating inclusion. When |x\u0304| = 0, the spectrum S 0 [S V ]\nis the monoid ring of the free monoid on one generator, and is in fact commutative.\nFor general x\u0304 it is the Thom spectrum of an associative monoid map from the\nfree monoid on one generator to the classifying space for H-equivariant real vector\nbundles, hence a twisted monoid ring. It is not typically a commutative algebra,\nthough the RO(H)-equivariant homotopy groups make it appear so, since \u03c0\u22c6H S 0 [S V ]\nis a free module over \u03c0\u22c6H S 0 with basis {1, x\u0304, x\u03042 , . . . }. It will be convenient to use\nthe notation\nS 0 [x\u0304] = S 0 [S V ].\nUsing the norm functor we can form the G-equivariant twisted monoid ring\nG\nNH\n(S 0 [S V ]) = S 0 [G+ \u2227 S V ].\nH\n\nThis spectrum can also be described as a Thom spectrum over the free commutative\nmonoid generated by G/H. Things will look cleaner, and better resemble the\n(polynomial) algebras we are modeling if we use the alternate notation\nS 0 [G * S V ] and S 0 [G * x\u0304].\nThough the symbol H is omitted in this notation, it is still referenced. The representation V is representation of H, and x\u0304 is an H-equivariant map with domain\nSV .\nBy smashing examples like these together we can make associative algebras that\nare twisted forms of free commutative monoid algebras over S 0 , in which the group\nG is allowed to act on the monoid. More explicitly, suppose we are given a sequence\n(possibly infinite) of subgroups Hi \u2282 G and for each i a positive representative\n((Vi )0 , (Vi )1 ) of a virtual representation Vi of Hi . For each i form\nS 0 [G * x\u0304i ]\nas described above, smash the first m together to make\nS 0 [G * x\u03041 , . . . , G * x\u0304m ],\nand then pass to the colimit to construct the G-equivariant associative algebra\nT = S 0 [G * x\u03041 , G * x\u03042 , . . . ].\nThe twisted monoid ring T can also be described as a Thom spectrum over the\nfree commutative monoid generated by the G-set\n\u221e\na\nJ=\nG/Hi .\ni=1\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n25\n\nBy construction, it is an indexed smash product of an indexed wedge\n(2.31)\n\nT =\n\n\u221e\n^ _\n\nS nV (j)\n\nj\u2208J n=0\n\nwhere for j = gHi , V (j) is the virtual representation of gHi g \u22121 with positive\nrepresentative\n\u0001\n\u0001\nV (j) = V (j)0 , V (j)1 = (gHi ) \u00d7 (Vi )0 , (Vi )1\nHi\n\nAll of this can be done relative to an equivariant commutative algebra R by\ndefining\nR[G * x\u03041 , G * x\u03042 , . . . ]\nto be\nR \u2227 S 0 [G * x\u03041 , G * x\u03042 , . . . ].\n\nBecause they can fail to be commutative, these twisted monoid rings do not have\nall of the algebraic properties one might hope for. But it is possible to naturally\nconstruct all of the equivariant monomial ideals. Here is how.\nApplied to (2.31) the distributive law of \u00a7A.3.3 gives an isomorphism of T with\nthe indexed wedge\n_\nS Vf\nT =\nf \u2208NJ\n0\n\nin which f is running through the set of functions\nJ \u2192 N0 = {0, 1, 2, . . . }\ntaking non-zero values on only finitely many elements (finitely supported functions).\nThe group G acts on the set NJ0 through its action on J, and Vf is the virtual\nrepresentation\nX\nVf =\nf (j) * V (j)\nj\u2208J\n\nof the stabilizer Hf of f , with the evident positive representation\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nM\nM\nf\n(j)\nf\n(j)\n\uf8ed\nV (j)0 ,\nV (j)1 \uf8f8 .\nj\u2208J\n\nj\u2208J\n\nNJ0\n\nThe G-set\nis a commutative monoid under addition of functions, and the ring\nstructure on T is the indexed sum of the obvious isomorphisms\nS Vf \u2227 S Vg \u2248 S Vf \u2295Vg \u2248 S Vf +g .\nRecall (for example from [15]) that an ideal in a commutative monoid L is a\nsubset I \u2282 L with the property that L + I \u2282 I. Given a G-stable ideal I \u2282 NJ0\nform the G-spectrum\n_\nTI =\nS Vf .\nf \u2208I\n\nThe formula for the multiplication in T implies that TI is an equivariant sub bimodule of T , and that the association I 7\u2192 TI is an inclusion preserving function\nfrom the set of ideals in NJ0 to the set of sub-bimodules of T . For a more general\nand systematic discussion see \u00a7A.3.6.\n\n\f26\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nExample 2.32. The monomial ideal corresponding to the set I of all non-zero elements of NJ0 is the augmentation ideal (up to homotopy it is the fiber of the map\nT \u2192 S 0 ). It is convenient to denote this T bimodule as (G * x\u03041 , G * x\u03042 , . . . ). More\ngenerally, for an integer n > 0 the set nI = I + * * * + I of n-fold sums of elements of\nI is a monoid ideal. It corresponds to the monomial ideal given by the nth power\nof the augmentation ideal.\nExample 2.33. Let dim : NJ0 \u2192 N0 be the function given by\nX\ndim f = dim Vf =\nf (j) dim Vj .\nj\u2208J\n\nIf for all i, dim Vi > 0, then the set {f | dim f \u2265 d} is a monoid ideal in NJ0\nand corresponds to the monomial ideal M \u2282 T consisting the wedge of spheres of\ndimension greater than d. The quotient bimodule Md /Md\u22121 can be identified with\nthe indexed coproduct\n_\nS Vf\ndim f =d\n\non which T is acting through the augmentation T \u2192 S 0 . These monomial ideals\nplay an important role in the proof of the Slice Theorem in \u00a76.\n2.4.2. The method of twisted monoid rings.\nDefinition 2.34. Suppose that\nfi : Bi \u2192 R,\n\ni = 1, . . . m\n\nare algebra maps from associative algebra Bi to a commutative algebra R. The\nsmash product of the fi is the algebra map\nm\n^\n\nfi :\n\nm\n^\n\nBi \u2192\n\nm\n^\n\nR \u2192 R,\n\nin which the right most map is the iterated multiplication. If B is an H-equivariant\nassociative algebra, and f : B \u2192 i\u2217H R is an algebra map, we define the norm of f\nto be the G-equivariant algebra map\nG\nNH\nB\u2192R\n\ngiven by\nG\nG \u2217\nNH\nB \u2192 NH\n(iH R) \u2192 R,\n\nin which the rightmost map is the counit of the adjunction described in Proposition 2.27.\nThese constructions make it easy to map a twisted monoid ring to a commutative\nalgebra. Suppose that R is a fibrant G-equivariant commutative algebra, and we're\ngiven a sequence\nx\u0304i \u2208 \u03c0VHii R,\ni = 1, 2, . . . .\nA choice of positive representative ((V0 )i , (V1 )i ) of Vi and a map\nS Vi \u2192 R\nrepresenting x\u0304i determines an associative algebra map\nS 0 [x\u0304i ] \u2192 R.\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n27\n\nApplying the norm gives a G-equivariant associative algebra map\nS 0 [G * x\u0304i ] \u2192 R.\nBy smashing these together we can make a sequence of equivariant algebra maps\nS 0 [G * x\u03041 , . . . , G * x\u0304m ] \u2192 R.\nPassing to the colimit gives an equivariant algebra map\nS 0 [G * x\u03041 , G * x\u03042 , . . . ] \u2192 R\n\n(2.35)\n\nrepresenting the sequence x\u0304i . We will refer to this process by saying that the\nmap (2.35) is constructed by the method of twisted monoid rings. The whole construction can also be made relative to a commutative algebra S, leading to an\nS-algebra map\nS[G * x\u03041 , G * x\u03042 , . . . ] \u2192 R\n\n(2.36)\n\nwhen R is a commutative S-algebra.\n2.4.3. Quotient modules. One important construction in ordinary stable homotopy\ntheory is the formation of the quotient of a module M over a commutative algebra\nR by the ideal generated by a sequence {x1 , x2 , . . . } \u2282 \u03c0\u2217 R. This is done by\ninductively forming the cofibration sequence of R-modules\n(2.37)\n\n\u03a3|xn | M/(x1 , . . . , xn\u22121 ) \u2192 M/(x1 , . . . , xn\u22121 ) \u2192 M/(x1 , . . . , xn )\n\nand passing to the homotopy colimit in the end. There is an evident equivalence\nM/(x1 , . . . ) \u2248 M \u2227 R/(x1 , . . . )\nR\n\nin case M is a cofibrant R-module. The situation is slightly trickier in equivariant\nstable homotopy theory, where the group G might act on the elements xi , and\nprevent the inductive approach described above. The method of twisted monoid\nrings (\u00a72.4.1) can be used to get around this difficulty.\nSuppose that R is a fibrant equivariant commutative algebra, and that\nx\u0304i \u2208 \u03c0VHii (R)\n\ni = 1, 2, . . .\n\nis a sequence of equivariant homotopy classes. Using the method of twisted monoid\nrings, construct an associative R-algebra map\nT = R[G * x\u03041 , G * x\u03042 , . . . ] \u2192 R.\n\n(2.38)\n\nUsing this map, we may regard an equivariant R-module M as a T -module. In\naddition to (2.38) we will make use of the augmentation \u01eb : T \u2192 R sending the x\u0304i\nto zero.\nDefinition 2.39. The quotient module M/(G * x\u03041 , . . . ) is the R-module\nL\n\nM \u2227R\nT\n\nin which T acts on M through the map (2.38) and on R through the augmentation.\nL\n\nThe symbol \u2227 denotes derived smash product. By Proposition B.139 it can be\ncomputed by taking a cofibrant approximation in either variable.\n\n\f28\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nLet us check that this construction reduces to the usual one when the group\nacting is the trivial group and M is a cofibrant R-module. For ease of notation,\nwrite\nT = R[x1 , . . . ]\nTn = R[x1 , . . . , xn ].\nUsing the isomorphism\nR[x1 , . . . ] \u2248 R[x1 , . . . , xn ] \u2227 R[xn+1 , . . . ]\nR\n\none can construct an associative algebra map\nT \u2192 R[xn+1 , . . . ]\nby smashing the augmentation\nR[x1 , . . . , xn ] \u2192 R\nsending each xi to 0, with the identity map of R[xn+1 , . . . ]. By construction, the\nevident map of T -algebras\nlim R[xn+1 , . . . ] \u2192 R\n\u2212\u2192\nis an isomorphism, and hence so is the map\nlim M \u2227 R[xn+1 , . . . ] \u2192 M \u2227 R.\n\u2212\u2192\nT\nT\nIn fact this isomorphism is also a derived equivalence. To see this construct a\nsequence\n\u2192 * * * Nn+1 \u2192 Nn+2 * * *\nof cofibrations of cofibrant left T -module approximations to\n\u2192 * * * R[xn+1 , . . . ] \u2192 R[xn+2 , . . . ] \u2192 * * * .\nWe have\n\u03c0\u2217 lim Nk \u2248 lim \u03c0\u2217 Nk \u2248 lim(\u03c0\u2217 R)[xk , . . . ] \u2248 R\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\nfrom which one concludes that the map\nlim Nk \u2192 lim R[xk , . . . ]\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\nis a cofibrant approximation. It follows that\nM/(x1 , . . . ) \u2248 holim M/(x1 , . . . , xn ).\n\u2212\u2192\nTo compare M/(x1 , . . . , xn\u22121 ) with M/(x1 , . . . , xn ) let Tn \u2192 R[xn ] be associative\nalgebra map constructed from the isomorphism\nTn \u2248 Tn\u22121 \u2227 R[xn ].\nR\n\nby smashing the augmentation of Tn\u22121 with the identity map of R[xn ].

Fixed points, isotropy separation and geometric fixed points.\n2.5.1. Fixed point spectra. The fixed point spectrum of a G-spectrum X is defined\nto be the spectrum of G fixed points in the underlying, non-equivariant spectrum\ni\u22170 X. In other words it is given by\nX 7\u2192 (i\u22170 X)G .\nThe notation i\u22170 X G can get clumsy and we will usually abbreviate it to X G .\nThe functor of fixed points has a left adjoint which sends S \u2212V \u2227 XV \u2208 S to\n\u2212V\nS\n\u2227 XV \u2208 SG , where in the latter expression V is regarded as a representation\nof G with trivial G-action and XV is regarded as a space with trivial G-action. It\ncan be computed for general X in terms of the tautological presentation\n_\n_\nJ (V, W )+ \u2227 S \u2212W \u2227 XV \u21d2\nS \u2212V \u2227 XV \u2192 X\nV,W\n\nV\n\nfor the trivial group (see (A.15)), once one observes that\nJ (V, W ) = JG (V, W )\nwhen V and W have trivial G-action.\n\n\f30\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nUnder the equivalence between SG and the category of objects in S equipped with\na G-action, the fixed point spectrum functor is formed by passing to objectwise fixed\npoints, and its left adjoint is given by regarding a non-equivariant spectrum as a\nG-object with trivial G-action.\nThe fixed point functor and its left adjoint form a Quillen morphism in the\npositive complete model structures. Neither the fixed point functor nor its left\nadjoint is homotopical and so both need to be derived. As one can easily check\nfrom the definition, if X is fibrant (or more generally has the property that for some\nexhausting sequence {Vn }, the map XVn \u2192 \u03a9Vn+1 \u2212Vn XVn+1 is a weak equivalence)\nthere is an isomorphism\n\u03c0\u2217 (X G ) \u2248 \u03c0\u2217G X.\nThe (derived) fixed point functor on spectra doesn't always have the properties\none might be led to expect by analogy with spaces. For example even though\nthe composition of the fixed point functor with its left adjoint is the identity, the\ncomposition of the derived functors is not. The derived fixed point functor does\nnot generally commute with smash products, or with the formation of suspension\nspectra.\n2.5.2. Isotropy separation and geometric fixed points. A standard approach to getting at the equivariant homotopy type of a G-spectrum X is to nest X between\ntwo pieces, one an aggregate of information about the spectra i\u2217H X for all proper\nsubgroups H \u2282 G, and the other a localization of X at a \"purely G\" part. This is\nthe isotropy separation sequence of X.\nMore formally, let P denote the family of proper subgroups of G, and EP the\n\"classifying space\" for P, characterized up to equivariant weak equivalence by the\nproperty that the space of fixed points EP G is empty, while for any proper H \u2282 G,\nEP H is weakly contractible. For convenience we will assume that EP has been\nchosen to be a G-CW complex. Such a model can be constructed as the join of\ninfinitely many copies of G/H with H ranging through the proper subgroups of G.\nIt can also be constructed as the unit sphere in the sum of infinitely many copies\nof the reduced regular representation of G.

The second is straightforward. Part iii) is Corollary B.185.

The isotropy separation sequence often leads to the situation of needing to show that a map X \u2192 Y of cofibrant G-spectra induces a weak equivalence\n\u1ebcP \u2227 X \u2192 \u1ebcP \u2227 Y.\nSince for every proper H \u2282 G, \u03c0\u2217H \u1ebcP \u2227 X = \u03c0\u2217H \u1ebcP \u2227 Y = 0, this is equivalent\nto showing that the map of geometric fixed point spectra \u03a6G X \u2192 \u03a6G Y is a weak\nequivalence.\nRemark 2.50. Since for every proper H \u2282 G, \u03c0\u2217H \u1ebcP \u2227 X = 0, it is also true that\n[T, \u1ebcP \u2227 X]G\n\u2217 = 0\n\n\f32\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C.

This holds, for example, if T is the suspension spectrum of a\nG-CW complex, and T0 \u2282 T is the subcomplex of G-fixed points.\nRemark 2.51. For a subgroup H \u2282 G and a G-spectrum X, it will be convenient\nto use the abbreviation\n\u03a6H X\nfor the more correct \u03a6H i\u2217H X. This situation comes up in our proof of the \"homotopy\nfixed point\" property of Theorem 10.8, where the more compound notation becomes\na little unwieldy.\nWe end this section with a simple result whose proof illustrates a typical use of\nthe geometric fixed point spectra.\nProposition 2.52. Suppose that X is a G-spectrum with the property that for\nall H \u2282 G, the geometric fixed point spectrum \u03a6H X is contractible. Then X is\ncontractible as a G-spectrum.\nProof: By induction on |G| we may assume that for proper H \u2282 G, the spectrum\ni\u2217H X is contractible. Since both G+ \u2227 ( \u2212 ) and the formation of mapping cones\nH\n\nare homotopical it follows that T \u2227 X is contractible for any G-CW complex built\nentirely from cells of the form G+ \u2227 Dn with H \u2282 G proper. This applies in\nH\n\nparticular to T = EP+ . The isotropy separation sequence then shows that\nX \u2192 \u1ebcP \u2227 X\nis a weak equivalence. But Remark 2.49 and our assumption that \u03a6G X is contractible imply that \u1ebcP \u2227 X is contractible.\n\u0003\n2.5.3. Monoidal geometric fixed points. For some purposes it is useful to have a\nversion of the geometric fixed point functor which is lax symmetric monoidal. For\nexample, such a functor automatically takes (commutative) algebras to (commutative) algebras. The geometric fixed point functor defined in [53, \u00a7V.4] has this\nproperty. We denote it \u03a6G\nM and refer to it as the monoidal geometric fixed point\nfunctor in order to distinguish it from \u03a6G . The following is a compendium of results\nfrom [53, \u00a7V.4]. The construction and proofs are described in \u00a7B.10.\nProposition 2.53. The monoidal geometric fixed point functor has the following\nproperties:\ni) It preserves acyclic cofibrations.\nii) It is lax symmetric monoidal.\niii) If X and Y are cofibrant, the map\nG\nG\n\u03a6G\nM (X) \u2227 \u03a6M (Y ) \u2192 \u03a6M (X \u2227 Y )\n\nis an isomorphism.\niv) It commutes with cobase change along a closed inclusion.\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n33\n\nv) It commutes with directed colimits.\nProperty iii) implies that \u03a6G\nM is weakly symmetric monoidal in the sense of the\ndefinition below.\nDefinition 2.54 (Schwede-Shipley [75]). A functor F : C \u2192 D between (symmetric) monoidal model categories is weakly (symmetric) monoidal if it is lax (symmetric) monoidal, and the map\nF (X) \u2227 F (Y ) \u2192 F (X \u2227 Y )\nis a weak equivalence when X and Y are cofibrant.\nThe next result is [53, Proposition V.4.17], and is discussed in more detail as\nProposition B.201.\nG\nProposition 2.55. The left derived functor of \u03a6G\nM is \u03a6 . More specifically, there\nare natural transformations\n\u223c\n\n\u03a6G (X) \u2192 \u03a6\u0303G\n\u2212 \u03a6G\nM (X) \u2190\nM (X)\nin which the rightmost arrow is a always weak equivalence and the leftmost arrow\nis a weak equivalence when X is cofibrant.\n\u0003\nBecause \u03a6G is lax monoidal, it determines functors\nG\n\u03a6G\nM : Alg \u2192 Alg\nG\n\u03a6G\nM : Comm \u2192 Comm,\n\nand for each associative algebra R a functor\n\u03a6G\n.\nM : MR \u2192 M\u03a6G\nMR\nIn addition, if R is an associative algebra, M a right R-module and N a left Rmodule there is a natural map\n(2.56)\n\nG\nG\n\u03a6G\nM (M \u2227 N ) \u2192 \u03a6M M \u2227 \u03a6M N.\nR\n\n\u03a6G\nMR\n\nThe argument for [53, Proposition V.4.7] shows that (2.56) is a weak equivalence\n(in fact an isomorphism) if M and N are cofibrant and R is \"cellular.\" See Proposition B.203. (Recently, Blumberg and Mandell [10, Appendix A] have shown that\none need only require one of M or N to be cofibrant in order to guarantee that this\nmap is an isomorphism.)\nWhile these properties if \u03a6G\nM are very convenient, they must be used with caution. The value \u03a6G\n(X)\nis\nonly\nguaranteed to have the \"correct\" homotopy type on\nM\ncofibrant objects. The spectrum underlying a commutative algebra is rarely known\nto be cofibrant, making the monoidal geometric fixed point functor difficult to use\nin that context. The situation is a little better with associative algebras. The weak\nequivalence (2.56) leads to an expression for the geometric fixed point spectrum of\na quotient module which we will use in \u00a77.3. In order to do so, we need criteria\nguaranteeing that the monoidal geometric fixed point functor realizes the correct\nhomotopy type. Such criteria are described in \u00a7B.10.4.\n\n\f34\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\n2.5.4. Geometric fixed points and the norm. The geometric fixed point construction\ninteracts well with the norm. Suppose H \u2282 G is a subgroup, and that X is an Hspectrum. The following result is proved as Proposition B.209. Our original version\nmerely concluded that the transformation in question was a weak equivalence on\ncofibrant objects. Andrew Blumberg and Mike Mandell pointed out that it is in\nfact an isomorphism on cofibrant objects, and at their request we have included a\nproof of the stronger statement.\nProposition 2.57. There is a natural map\nG\nG\n\u03a6H\nM X \u2192 \u03a6M (NH X)\n\nwhich is an isomorphism, hence a weak equivalence, on cofibrant objects.\nBecause of Proposition 2.55 and the fact that the norm preserves cofibrant objects (Proposition B.89), the above result gives a natural zig-zag of weak equivG\nalences relating \u03a6H (X) and \u03a6G (NH\nX) when X is cofibrant. In fact there is a\nnatural zig-zag of maps\nG\n\u03a6H X \u2194 \u03a6G (NH\nX)\nwhich is a weak equivalence not only for cofibrant X, but for suspension spectra\nof cofibrant G-spaces and for the spectra underlying cofibrant commutative rings.\nThe actual statement is somewhat technical, and is one of the main results of\nAppendix B. The condition is described in the statement of Proposition B.213. See\nalso Remarks B.215 and B.216.\nCorollary 2.58. For the spectra satisfying the condition of Proposition B.213, the\ncomposite functor\nG\n\u03a6G \u25e6 N H\n: SH \u2192 S\npreserves, up to weak equivalence, wedges, directed colimits along closed inclusions\nand cofiber sequences.\nProof: The properties obviously hold for \u03a6H .\n\n\u0003\n\nThere is another useful result describing the interaction of the geometric fixed\npoint functor with the norm map in RO(G)-graded cohomology described in \u00a72.3.3.\nSuppose that R is a G-equivariant commutative algebra, X is a G-space, and V \u2208\nRO(H) a virtual real representation of a subgroup H \u2282 G. In this situation one\ncan compose the norm\nV\nind V\nN : RH\n(X) \u2192 RG\n(X)\nwith the geometric fixed point map\nH\n\nind V\n\u03a6G : RG\n(X) \u2192 (\u03a6G R)V (X G ),\n\nwhere V H \u2282 V is the subspace of H-fixed vectors, and X G is the space of G-fixed\npoints in X.\nProposition 2.59. The composite\nH\n\nV\n(X) \u2192 (\u03a6G R)V (X G )\n\u03a6G \u25e6 N : RH\n\nis a ring homomorphism.\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n35\n\nProof: Multiplicativity is a consequence of the fact that both the norm and the\ngeometric fixed point functors are weakly monoidal. Additivity follows from the\n\u0003\nfact that the composition \u03a6G \u25e6 N preserves wedges (Corollary 2.58).\n3. Mackey functors, homology and homotopy\n3.1. Mackey functors. In equivariant homotopy theory, the role of \"abelian group\"\nis played by the notion of a Mackey functor (Dress [18]). The following is the summary of Dress' definition as it appears in Greenlees-May [26].\nDefinition 3.1 (Dress [18]). A Mackey functor consists of a pair M = (M\u2217 , M \u2217 ) of\nfunctors from the category of finite G-sets to the category of abelian groups. The\ntwo functors have the same object function (denoted M ) and take disjoint unions to\ndirect sums. The functor M\u2217 is covariant, while M \u2217 is contravariant, and together\nthey take a pullback diagram of finite G-sets\nS\n\n\u03b4\n\n/A\n\n\u03b3\n\n\u000f\nT\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b2\n\n\u000f\n/B\n\nto a commutative square\nM (P )\nO\n\n\u03b4\u2217\n\n/ M (X)\nO\n\n\u03b3\u2217\n\nM (Y )\n\n\u03b1\u2217\n\n\u03b2\u2217\n\n/ M (Z)\n\nwhere \u03b1\u2217 = M \u2217 (\u03b1), \u03b2\u2217 = M\u2217 (\u03b2), etc.\nThe contravariant maps M \u2217 (\u03b1) are called the restriction maps, and the covariant\nmaps M\u2217 (\u03b2), the transfer maps.\nA Mackey functor can also be defined as a contravariant additive functor from\nthe full subcategory of SG consisting of the suspension spectra \u03a3\u221e B+ of finite Gsets B. It is a theorem of tom Dieck that these definitions are equivalent. See [26,\n\u00a75].\nThe equivariant homotopy groups of a G-spectrum X are naturally part of the\nMackey functor \u03c0 n X defined by\n(\u03c0 n X)\u2217 (B) = [S n \u2227 B+ , X]G\n(\u03c0 n X)\u2217 (B) = [S n , X \u2227 B+ ]G .\nThe identification of the two object functors\n[S n \u2227 B+ , X]G \u2248 [S n , X \u2227 B+ ]G\ncomes from the self-duality of finite G-sets (Example 2.6). For B = G/H one has\n\u03c0 n X(B) = \u03c0nH X.\nThe Mackey functor \u03c0 0 S 0 is the Burnside ring Mackey functor A. It is the free\nMackey functor on one generator. For a G-set B, the value A(B) is the group\ncompletion of the monoid of isomorphism classes of finite G-sets T \u2192 B over B\nunder disjoint union. The restriction maps are given by pullback, and the transfer\n\n\f36\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nmaps by composition. The group A(G/H) works out to be isomorphic to the abelian\ngroup underlying the Burnside ring of finite H-sets.\nJust as every abelian group can occur as a stable homotopy group, every Mackey\nfunctor M can occur as an equivariant stable homotopy group. In fact associated\nto each Mackey functor M is an equivariant Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum HM ,\ncharacterized by the property\n(\nM\nn=0\n\u03c0 n HM =\n0\nn 6= 0.\nSee [26, \u00a75] or [47].\nThe homology and cohomology groups of a G-spectrum X with coefficients in\nM are defined by\nHkG (X; M ) = \u03c0kG HM \u2227 X\nk\nHG\n(X; M ) = [X, \u03a3k HM ]G .\n\nFor a pointed G-space Y one defines\nHnG (Y ; M ) = HnG (\u03a3\u221e Y ; M )\nn\nn\n(\u03a3\u221e Y ; M ).\nHG\n(Y ; M ) = HG\n\nWe emphasize that the equivariant (co)homology groups of pointed G-spaces Y we\nconsider will always be reduced (co)homology groups.\nWe will have need to consider the ordinary, non-equivariant homology and cohomology groups of the spectrum i\u22170 X underlying a G-spectrum X. It will be\nconvenient to employ the shorthand notation\nHnu (X; Z) = Hn (i\u22170 X; Z)\nHun (X; Z) = H n (i\u22170 X; Z)\nfor these groups.\n3.2. Constant and permutation Mackey functors. The constant Mackey functor Z is the functor represented on the category of finite G-sets by the abelian group\nZ with trivial G-action. The value of Z on a finite G-set B is the group of functions\nZ(B) = homG (B, Z) = hom(B/G, Z).\nThe restriction maps are given by precomposition, and the transfer maps by summing over the fibers. For K \u2282 H \u2282 G, the transfer map associated by Z to\nG/K \u2192 G/H\nis the map Z \u2192 Z given by multiplication by the index of K in H.\nDefinition 3.2. Suppose that S is a G-set, and write Z{S} for the free abelian\ngroup generated by S, and ZS for the ring of functions S to Z. The permutation\nMackey functor Z{S} is the Mackey functor\nZ{S}(B) = homG (B, Z{S}),\nwhose restriction maps are given by precomposition and transfer maps by summing\nover the fibers.\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n37\n\nThe permutation Mackey functor Z{S} is naturally isomorphic to the Mackey\nfunctor \u03c0 0 HZ \u2227 S+ . To see this note that restricting to underlying non-equivariant\nspectra gives a map\n\u03c0 0 HZ \u2227 S+ (B) = [B+ , HZ \u2227 S+ ]G \u2192 [B+ , HZ \u2227 S+ ],\nwhose image lies in the G-invariant part. Since\n[B+ , HZ \u2227 S+ ] = hom(B, Z{S})\nthis gives a natural transformation\n\u03c0 0 HZ \u2227 S+ \u2192 Z{S}.\nSince both sides take filtered colimits in S to filtered colimits, to check that it is\nan isomorphism, it suffices to do so when S is finite. In that case we can use the\nself duality of finite G-sets to compute\n[B+ , HZ \u2227 S+ ]G \u2248 [B+ \u2227 S+ , HZ]G ,\nand then observe that by definition of the constant Mackey functor Z, the forgetful\nmap\n[B+ \u2227 S+ , HZ]G \u2192 [B+ \u2227 S+ , HZ]\nis an isomorphism with the G-invariant part of the target. The claim then follows\nfrom the compatibility of equivariant Spanier-Whitehead duality with the restriction functor to non-equivariant spectra.\nThe properties of permutation Mackey functors listed in the Lemma below follow\nimmediately from the definition. They are used in \u00a74.6.2 to establish some of our\nbasic tools for investigating the slice tower. To formulate part ii), note that every\nG-set B receives a functorial map from a free G-set, namely G \u00d7 B, and the group\nof equivariant automorphisms of G \u00d7 B over B is canonically isomorphic to G. For\ninstance, one can give G \u00d7 B the product of the left action on G and the trivial\naction on B, and take the map G\u00d7 B \u2192 B to be the original action mapping. With\nthis choice the automorphisms G \u00d7 B over B are of the form (g, b) 7\u2192 (g x, x\u22121 b)\nwith x \u2208 G.\nLemma 3.3. Let M be a permutation Mackey functor and B finite G-set.\ni) If B \u2032 \u2192 B is a surjective map of finite G-sets, then\nM (B) \u2192 M (B \u2032 ) \u21d2 M (B \u2032 \u00d7 B \u2032 )\nB\n\nis an equalizer.\nii) Restriction along the action map G \u00d7 B \u2192 B gives an isomorphism\nM (B) \u2192 M (G \u00d7 B)G .\niii) The restriction mapping M (G/H) \u2192 M (G) gives an isomorphism\nM (G/H) \u2192 M (G)H\nof M (G/H) with the H-invariant part of M (G).\niv) A map M \u2192 M \u2032 of permutation Mackey functors is an isomorphism if and\nonly if M (G) \u2192 M \u2032 (G) is an isomorphism.\n\u0003\n\n\f38\n\nM.

The Mackey functor homology\nand cohomology groups of a G-CW spectrum X can be computed from a chain\ncomplex analogous to the complex of cellular chains (see, for example [26, \u00a75]).\nWrite X (n) for the n-skeleton of X so that\nX (n) /X (n\u22121) \u2248 Xn+ \u2227 S n\nwith Xn a discrete G-set.

By writing the G-set Xn\nn\nas a coproduct of finite G-sets Xn\u03b1 one can express Cncell (X; M ) and Ccell\n(X; M ) in\n\u03b1\nterms of the values of the Mackey functor M on the Xn .\nExample 3.4. Write \u03c1G for the (real) regular representation of G and \u03c1G \u2212 1 for the\nreduced regular representation. The groups\nH \u2217 (S \u03c1G \u22121 ; M )\nplay an important role in equivariant stable homotopy theory. To describe them\nwe need an equivariant cell decomposition of S \u03c1G \u22121 . Since S \u03c1G \u22121 is the mapping\ncone of the map\nS(\u03c1G \u2212 1) \u2192 pt\nfrom the unit sphere in (\u03c1G \u2212 1) it suffices to construct an equivariant cell decomposition of S(\u03c1G \u2212 1). Write g = |G|. Think of RG as the vector space with basis\nthe elements of G. The boundary of the standard simplex in this space is equivariantly homeomorphic to S(\u03c1G \u2212 1). The simplicial decomposition of this simplex\nis not an equivariant cell decomposition, but the barycentric subdivision is. Thus\nS(\u03c1G \u2212 1) is homeomorphic to the geometric realization of the poset of non-empty\nproper subsets of G. This leads to the complex\n(3.5)\n\nM (G/G) \u2192 M (S0 ) \u2192 M (S1 ) \u2192 * * * \u2192 M (Sg\u22121 )\n\nin which Sk is the G-set of flags F0 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Fk \u2282 G of proper inclusions of subsets\nof G, with G acting by translation. The coboundary map is the alternating sum of\nthe restriction maps derived by omitting one of the sets in a flag.\nCorollary 3.6. For any Mackey functor M , the group\n0\n\u03c0\u03c1GG \u22121 HM = HG\n(S \u03c1G \u22121 ; M )\n\nis given by\n\n\\\n\nH(G\n\n\u0001\nker M (G/G) \u2192 M (G/H) .\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n39\n\nProof: Using the complex (3.5) it suffices to show that the orbit types occurring\nin S0 are precisely the transitive G-sets of the form G/H with H a proper subgroup\nof G. The set S0 is the set of non-empty proper subsets S \u2282 G. Any proper\nsubgroup H of G occurs as the stabilizer of itself, regarded as a subset of G. Since\nthe subsets are proper, the group G does not occur as a stabilizer.\n\u0003\nExample 3.7. Let X be the sphere S d\u22121 with the action of C2n given by the antipodal map, and pointed by adding a disjoint base point.

If V is orientable then the G-action\nis trivial, and one finds that the restriction map\nHdG (S V ; Z) \u2192 Hdu (S V ; Z)\nis an isomorphism. A choice of orientation gives an equivariant isomorphism\nHdu (S V ; Z) \u2248 Z.\nThus when V is oriented there is a unique isomorphism\nHdG (S V ; Z) \u2248 Z\nextending the non-equivariant isomorphism given by the orientation.\n3.4. Homology and geometric fixed points. In addition to the Mackey functor\nhomotopy groups \u03c0 \u2217 X there are the RO(G) graded homotopy groups \u03c0\u22c6G X defined\nby\n\u03c0VG X = [S V , X]G\nV \u2208 RO(G).\nHere RO(G) is the Grothendieck group of real representations of G. The use of\n\u22c6 for the wildcard symbol in \u03c0\u22c6G is taken from Hu-Kriz [35]. The RO(G)-graded\nhomotopy groups are also part of a Mackey functor \u03c0 \u22c6 (X) defined by\n\u03c0 V X(B) = [S V \u2227 B+ , X]G .\nAs with Z-graded homotopy groups, we'll use the abbreviation\n\u03c0VH X = (\u03c0 V X)(G/H).\nIn this section we will make use of RO(G)-graded homotopy groups to describe the\ngeometric fixed point spectrum \u03a6G HZ when G = C2n (Proposition 3.18 below).\nThere are a few distinguished elements of RO(G)-graded homotopy groups we\nwill need. Let V be a representation of G and S 0 \u2192 S V the one point compactification of the inclusion {0} \u2282 V .\nDefinition 3.11. The element\nG\naV \u2208 \u03c0\u2212V\nS0\nG\nis the element corresponding under the suspension isomorphism \u03c0\u2212V\nS 0 \u2248 \u03c00G S V\n0\nV\nto the map S \u0592\u2192 S described above.\n\nThe element aV is the Euler class of V in RO(G)-graded equivariant stable cohomotopy. If V contains a trivial representation then aV = 0. For two representations\nV and W one has\nG\n0\naV \u2295W = aV aW \u2208 \u03c0\u2212V\n\u2212W S .\nWhen V is oriented, Example 3.10 provides a preferred generator of HdG (S V ; Z).\nWe give the corresponding RO(G)-graded homotopy class name.\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n41\n\nDefinition 3.12. Let V be an oriented representation of G of dimension d. The\nelement\nG\nuV \u2208 \u03c0d\u2212V\nHZ.\nis the element corresponding to the preferred generator of \u03c0d HZ\u2227S V = HdG (S V ; Z)\ngiven by Example 3.10.\nIf V is trivial then uV = 1. If V and W are two oriented representations of G,\nand V \u2295 W is given the direct sum orientation, then\nuV \u2295W = uV uW .\nAmong other things this implies that the class uV is stable in V in the sense that\nuV +1 = uV .\nFor any V , the representation V \u2295 V has a canonical orientation, giving\nG\nuV \u2295V \u2208 \u03c02d\u22122V\nHZ.\n\nWhen V is oriented this class can be identified, up to sign, with u2V .\nThe elements aV and uV behave well with respect to the norm. The following\nresult is a simple consequence of the fact (2.11) that N S V = S ind V .\nLemma 3.13. Suppose that V is a d-dimensional representation of a subgroup\nH \u2282 G. Then\nN aV = aind V\nuind d * N uV = uind V ,\nwhere ind V = indG\nH V is the induced representation and d is the trivial representation.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.14. As is standard in algebra, we will adopt the convention that the\noperation of mutiplication by an element of a ring on a module is denoted by the\nelement of the ring. We will also use it in closely related contexts. For example,\nfor a G-spectrum X we will refer to the to the maps\naV \u2227 1X : S \u2212V \u2227 X \u2192 X\nuV \u2227 1X : S d\u2212V \u2227 X \u2192 HZ \u2227 X\nas multiplication by aV and uV respectively, and, when no confusion is likely, denote\nthem simply by aV and uV . Note that X might be a virtual representation sphere.\nThis means that we will not usually distinguish in notation between these maps\nand their suspensions. Similarly, if R is any equivariant algebra, and x \u2208 \u03c0VG S 0\nthen the product of x with 1 \u2208 \u03c00G R will be denoted x \u2208 \u03c0VG R. In accordance with\nthis, at various places in this paper the symbol aV might refer to a map S \u2212V \u2192 S 0 ,\nor its suspension S 0 \u2192 S V or the Hurewicz image S 0 \u2192 HZ \u2227 S V or equivalently\nan element of \u03c00G HZ \u2227 S V .\nExample 3.15.

When d is odd the\ngroup Hd (S d\u03c3 ; Z) is zero. When d is even, the representation d\u03c3 acquires a canonical\norientation, the group HdC2 (S d\u03c3 ; Z) is canonically isomorphic to the integers, and\nthe preferred generator is the class ud\u03c3 (Remark 3.14).

If |G| > 2 then S(\u03c1G \u2212 1) is connected,\nhence so is the orbit space. If G = C2 , then S(\u03c1G \u2212 1) \u2248 G and the orbit space\nis still connected. In all cases then, the unreduced suspension S \u03c1G \u22121 /G is simply\nconnected.

A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C.

The slice filtration\nThe slice filtration is an equivariant analogue of the Postnikov tower, to which\nit reduces in the case of the trivial group. In this section we introduce the slice\nfiltration and establish some of its basic properties. We work for the most part with\na general finite group G, though our application to the Kervaire invariant problem\ninvolves only the case G = C2n . While the situation for general G exhibits many\nremarkable properties, the reader should regard as exploratory the apparatus of\ndefinitions at this level of generality.\nFrom now until the end of \u00a711 our focus will be on homotopy theory. Though\nit will not appear in the notation, all spectra should be replaced by cofibrant or\nfibrant approximations where appropriate.\n4.1. Slice cells.\n4.1.1. Slice cells and their dimension. For a subgroup K \u2282 G let \u03c1K denote its\nregular representation, and write\nb\nS(m,\nK) = G+ \u2227 S m\u03c1K\nK\n\nm \u2208 Z.\n\nDefinition 4.1. The set of slice cells is\n\nb\nb\n{S(m,\nK), \u03a3\u22121 S(m,\nK) | m \u2208 Z, K \u2282 G}.\n\nThis brings two notions of \"cell\" into the story: the slice cells and the cells\nof the form G/H+ \u2227 Dm , used to manufacture G-CW spectra. We'll refer to the\ntraditional equivariant cells as \"G-cells\" in order to distinguish them from the slice\ncells.\nb\nDefinition 4.2. A slice cell is regular if it is of the form S(m,\nK).\n\nDefinition 4.3. A slice cell is induced if it is of the form\nb\nG+ \u2227 S,\nH\n\nwhere Sb is a slice cell for H and H \u2282 G is a proper subgroup. It is free if H is the\ntrivial group. A slice cell is isotropic if it is not free.\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n45\n\nSince\n[G+ \u2227 S, X]G \u2248 [S, i\u2217H X]H\nH\n\nand\n\n[X, G+ \u2227 S]G \u2248 [i\u2217H X, S]H ,\nH\n\ninduction on |G| usually reduces claims about cells to the case of those which are\nnot induced. The slice cells which are not induced are those of the form S m\u03c1G and\nS m\u03c1G \u22121 .\nDefinition 4.4. The dimension of a slice cell is defined by\nb\ndim S(m,\nK) = m|K|\n\nb\ndim \u03a3\u22121 S(m,\nK) = m|K| \u2212 1.\n\nIn other words the dimension of a slice cell is that of its underlying spheres.\nRemark 4.5. Not every suspension of a slice cell is a slice cell. Typically, the\nb\nspectrum \u03a3\u22122 S(m,\nK) will not be a slice cell, and will not exhibit the properties of\nb\na slice cell of dimension dim S(m,\nK) \u2212 2.\nThe following is immediate from the definition.\n\nProposition 4.6. Let H \u2282 G be a subgroup. If Sb is a G-slice cell of dimension\nd, then i\u2217H Sb is a wedge of H-slice cells of dimension d. If Sb is an H-slice cell of\ndimension d then G+ \u2227 Sb is a G-slice cell of dimension d.\n\u0003\nH\n\nThe regular slice cells behave well under the norm.\n\nc is a wedge of regular H-slice\nProposition 4.7. Let H \u2282 G be a subgroup. If W\nGc\ncells, then NH W is a wedge of regular G-slice cells.\n\nProof: The wedges of regular H-slice cells are exactly the indexed wedges (in\nthe sense of \u00a72.3.2) of spectra of the form S m\u03c1K for K \u2282 H, and m \u2208 Z. Since\nregular representations induce to regular representations, the identity (2.11) and\nthe distribution formula (Proposition A.37) show that the norm of such an indexed\nwedge is an indexed wedge of S m\u03c1K with K \u2282 G and m \u2208 Z. The claim follows. \u0003\n4.1.2. Slice positive and slice null spectra. Underlying the theory of the Postnikov\ntower is the notion of \"connectivity\" and the class of (n \u2212 1)-connected spectra.\nIn this section we describe the slice analogues of these ideas. There is a simple\nrelationship between \"connectivity\" and \"slice-positivity\" which we will describe in\ndetail in \u00a74.4.\nDefinition 4.8.

Similarly, the full subcategory of S consisting of X with\nG\nG\nX < n will be denoted S<n or S\u2264n\u22121 .\nG\ncontaining\nRemark 4.9.

The fiber of a map of slice n-positive spectra is not assumed to be\nslice n-positive, and need not be. For example, the fiber of \u2217 \u2192 S \u03c1G is S \u03c1G \u22121 which\nis not slice (|G| \u2212 1)-positive, even though both \u2217 and S \u03c1G are.\nFor n = 0, \u22121, the notions of slice n-null and slice n-positive are familiar.\nProposition 4.11. For a G-spectrum X the following hold\ni) X \u2265 0 \u21d0\u21d2 X is (\u22121)-connected, i.e. \u03c0 k X = 0 for k < 0;\nii) X \u2265 \u22121 \u21d0\u21d2 X is (\u22122)-connected, i.e. \u03c0 k X = 0 for k < \u22121;\niii) X < 0 \u21d0\u21d2 X is 0-coconnected, i.e. \u03c0 k X = 0 for k \u2265 0;\niv) X < \u22121 \u21d0\u21d2 X is (\u22121)-coconnected, i.e. \u03c0 k X = 0 for k \u2265 \u22121;\nProof: These are all straightforward consequences of the fact that S 0 is a slice\ncell of dimension 0, and S \u22121 is a slice cell of dimension (\u22121).\n\u0003\nRemark 4.12. It is not the case that if Y > 0 then \u03c00 Y = 0. In Proposition 4.15 we\nwill see that the fiber F of S 0 \u2192 HZ has the property that F > 0. On the other\nhand \u03c0 0 F is the augmentation ideal of the Burnside ring. Proposition 4.48 below\ngives a characterization of slice-positive spectra.\nThe classes of slice n-null and slice n-positive spectra are preserved under change\nof group.\nProposition 4.13. Suppose H \u2282 G, that X is a G-spectrum and Y is an Hspectrum.

For a G-spectrum X, the following are equivalent\ni) X < n;\nb X]G = 0.\nii) For all slice cells Sb with dim Sb \u2265 n, [S,\nProof: The first condition trivially implies the second. We prove that the second\nimplies the first by induction on |G|. By the induction hypothesis we may assume\nthat the G-space\nb X)\nSG (S,\n \u0304\nis contractible for all induced slice cells Sb with dim Sb \u2265 n, and that for all slice\ncells Sb with dim Sb \u2265 n, and all proper H \u2282 G, the space\nb X)H\nSG (S,\n \u0304\nis contractible.

They are zero by assumption when t = 0. For t > 0, the first case is a\nspecial case of the second, since S 1 \u2227 S m\u03c1G \u22121 is a slice cell of dimension m|G|. Let\nT be the homotopy fiber of the map\nS t \u2282 S t\u03c1G ,\nand consider the exact sequence\n[S t\u03c1G \u2227 S m\u03c1G , X]G \u2192 [S t \u2227 S m\u03c1G , X]G \u2192 [T \u2227 S m\u03c1G , X]G .\nThe leftmost group is zero since S t\u03c1G \u2227 S m\u03c1G is a slice cell of dimension (t +\nm)|G| \u2265 n. The rightmost group is zero by the induction hypothesis since T is\n(\u22121)-connected and built entirely from induced G-cells.

Let P n X be the Bousfield localization, or Dror Farjoun\nnullification ([19, 30]) of X with respect to the class SG\n>n , and Pn+1 X the homotopy\nfiber of X \u2192 P n X. Thus, by definition, there is a functorial fibration sequence\nPn+1 X \u2192 X \u2192 P n X.\nThe functor P n X can be constructed as the colimit of a sequence of functors\nW0 X \u2192 W1 X \u2192 * * * .\nThe Wi X are defined inductively starting with W0 X = X, and taking Wk X to be\nthe cofiber of\n_\n\u03a3t Sb \u2192 Wk\u22121 X,\nI\n\nin which the indexing set I is the set of maps \u03a3t Sb \u2192 Wk\u22121 X with Sb > n a slice cell\nand t \u2265 0. By Lemma 4.14 the functors P n can also be formed using the analogous\nconstruction using only slice cells themselves, and not their suspensions.\n\nProposition 4.15.

When G is the trivial group the slice cells are just ordinary cells\nand the slice tower becomes the Postnikov tower. It therefore follows from Proposition 4.21 that the tower of non-equivariant spectra underlying the slice tower is\nthe Postnikov tower.\n4.3. Multiplicative properties of the slice tower. The slice filtration does not\nquite have the multiplicative properties one might expect. In this section we collect\na few results describing how things work. One important result is Corollary 4.32\nasserting that the slice sections of a (\u22121)-connected commutative or associative\nalgebra are (\u22121)-connected commutative or associative algebras.

Smashing with S m\u03c1G gives a bijection of the set of slice cells Sb with\ndim Sb = k and those with dim Sb = k + m|G|.\nProof: Since the restriction of \u03c1G to K \u2282 G is |G/K|\u03c1K there is an identity\nS \u03c1G \u2227 (G+ \u2227 S m\u03c1K ) \u2248 G+ \u2227 (S \u03c1G \u2227 S m\u03c1K ) \u2248 G+ \u2227 S (|G/K|+m)\u03c1K .\nK\n\nK\n\nK\n\nThe result follows easily from this.\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 4.24.

If X \u2265 n, Y \u2265 m, and n is divisible by |G| then X \u2227Y \u2265 n+m.\nProof: By smashing X with S (\u2212n/|G|)\u03c1G and using Corollary 4.25 we may assume\nn = 0. Suppose that Z < m. Since Y \u2265 m, the zero space of function spectrum Z Y\nis contractible, and so Z Y is 0-coconnected.

The main point of this section is to establish strong\nconvergence of the slice spectral sequence, and to show that for any X the E2 -term\nis distributed in the gray region of Figure 1. We begin with some results relating\nthe slice sections to Postnikov sections.\n4.4.1. Connectivity and the slice filtration. Our convergence result for the slice spectral sequence depends on knowing how slice cells are constructed from G-cells. We\nwill say that a space or spectrum X decomposes into the elements of a collection\nof spectra {T\u03b1 } if X is weakly equivalent to a spectrum X\u0303 admitting an increasing\nfiltration\nX0 \u2282 X1 \u2282 * * *\nwith the property that Xn /Xn\u22121 is weakly equivalent to a wedge of T\u03b1 .\nRemark 4.36. A G-spectrum X decomposes into a collection of spectra {G/H+ \u2227\nS m }, with H and m ranging through some indexing list, if and only if X is weakly\nequivalent a G-CW spectrum with G-cells of the form G/H+ \u2227 Dm , with H and m\nranging through the same list.\nRemark 4.37. To say that X decomposes into the elements of a collection of compact\nobjects {T\u03b1 } means that X is in the smallest subcategory of SG closed under weak\n \u0304\nequivalences, arbitrary wedges, and the formation of mapping cones and extensions\n(i.e., the properties listed in Remark 4.9).\nLemma 4.38. Let Sb be a slice cell. If dim Sb = n \u2265 0, then Sb decomposes into the\nspectra G/H+ \u2227 S k with \u230an/|G|\u230b \u2264 k \u2264 n. If dim Sb = n < 0 then Sb decomposes\ninto G/H+ \u2227 S k with n \u2264 k \u2264 \u230an/|G|\u230b.\nProof: The cell structure of S \u03c1G \u22121 described in Example 3.4 has G-cells ranging in dimension from 0 to |G| \u2212 1, and suspends to a cell decomposition of S \u03c1G\nwith G-cells whose dimension ranges from 1 to |G|. The cases Sb = S m\u03c1G and\nSb = S m\u03c1G \u22121 with m \u2265 0 are handled by smashing these together and passing to\nsuspension spectra. For m < 0, Spanier-Whitehead duality gives an equivariant cell\ndecomposition of S m\u03c1G into cells whose dimensions range from m|G| to m and of\n\u03a3\u22121 S m\u03c1G into cells whose dimensions range from n = m|G| \u2212 1 to m \u2212 1 = \u230an/|G|\u230b.\nFinally, the case in which Sb is induced from a subgroup K \u2282 G is proved by left\ninducing its K-equivariant cell decomposition.\n\u0003\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n53\n\nCorollary 4.39.

We will prove the claim by induction\non |G|, the case of the trivial group being obvious. Using Proposition 4.13 we may\nassume by induction that (G/H)+ \u2227 S k > n when n \u2265 0 and H \u2282 G is a proper\nsubgroup. This implies that if T is an equivariant CW-spectrum built from G-cells\nof the form (G/H)+ \u2227 S k with k > n and H \u2282 G a proper subgroup, then T > n.\nThe homotopy fiber of the natural inclusion\nS k \u2192 S k\u03c1G\ncan be identified with the suspension spectrum of S(k\u03c1G \u2212 k)+ \u2227 S k , and so is such\na T .

The slice spectral sequence is the spectral sequence\nassociated to the tower of fibration {P n X}, and it takes the form\nG\nG\nE2s,t = \u03c0t\u2212s\nPtt X =\u21d2 \u03c0t\u2212s\nX.\n\nIt can be regarded as a spectral sequence of Mackey functors, or of individual\nhomotopy groups. We have chosen our indexing so that the display of the spectral\nsequence is in accord with the classical Adams spectral sequence: the Ers,t -term is\nplaced in the plane in position (t \u2212 s, s). The situation is depicted in Figure 1. The\ndifferential dr maps Ers,t to Ers+r,t+r\u22121 , or in terms the display in the plane, the\ngroup in position (t \u2212 s, s) to the group in position (t \u2212 s \u2212 1, s + r).\nThe following is an immediate consequence of Proposition 4.40. As there, we\nwrite g = |G|.\nTheorem 4.42. Let X be a G-spectrum.

The situation is depicted in Figure 1. The homotopy groups of individual slices lie along lines of slope \u22121, and the groups contributing to \u03c0 \u2217 P n X lie\nto the left of a line of slope \u22121 intersecting the (t \u2212 s)-axis at (t \u2212 s) = n. All of\nthe groups outside the gray region are zero. The vanishing in the regions labeled\n1-4 correspond to the four parts of Proposition 4.40.\nProposition 4.40 also gives a relationship between the Postnikov tower and the\nslice tower.\nCorollary 4.44.

By part i) of Proposition 4.40\nthese are in SG\n\u0003\n\u2265n .\nWe end this section with an application. The next result says that if a tower\nlooks like the slice tower, then it is the slice tower.\nProposition 4.45. Suppose that X \u2192 {P\u0303 n } is a map from X to a tower of\nfibrations with the properties\ni) the map X \u2192 lim P\u0303 n is a weak equivalence;\n\u2190\u2212\nii) the spectrum limn P\u0303 n is contractible;\n\u2212\u2192\niii) for all n, the fiber of the map P\u0303 n \u2192 P\u0303 n\u22121 is an n-slice.\nThen P\u0303 n is the slice tower of X.\nProof: We first show that P\u0303 n is slice (n + 1)-null. We will use the criteria of\nLemma 4.14. Suppose that Sb is a slice cell with dim Sb > n.

This\nis an isomorphism. It then follows from assumption ii) that [S,\nn\nshows that P\u0303 is slice (n + 1)-null. Now let P\u0303n+1 be the homotopy fiber of the map\nX \u2192 P\u0303 n . By Lemma 4.16, the result will follow if we can show P\u0303n+1 > n. By\nassumption iii), for any N > n + 1, the spectrum\nP\u0303n+1 \u222a C P\u0303N\nadmits a finite filtration whose layers are m-slices, with m \u2265 n + 1. It follows that\nP\u0303n+1 \u222a C P\u0303N > n.\nIn view of the cofibration sequence\nP\u0303N \u2192 P\u0303n+1 \u2192 P\u0303n+1 \u222a C P\u0303N ,\nto show that P\u0303n+1 > n it suffices to show that P\u0303N > n for some N > n.\nLet Z be any slice (n + 1)-null spectrum. We need to show that the G-space\nSG (P\u0303N , Z)\n \u0304\nis contractible. We do this by studying the Mackey functor homotopy groups of the\nspectra involved, and appealing to an argument using the usual equivariant notion\nof connectivity. By Theorem 4.42, there is an integer m with the property that for\nk > m,\n\u03c0 k Z = 0.\nBy Corollary 4.43 and assumption iii), for N \u226b 0 and any N \u2032 > N ,\n\u03c0 k P\u0303N \u222a C P\u0303N \u2032 = 0,\n\nk \u2264 m,\n\nso\n\u03c0 k P\u0303N \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 k P\u0303N\nis an isomorphism for k \u2264 m.

The RO(G)-graded slice spectral sequence. Applying RO(G)-graded homotopy groups to the slice tower leads to an RO(G)-graded slice spectral sequence\ndim V\nG\nE2s,V = \u03c0VG\u2212s Pdim\nV X =\u21d2 \u03c0V \u2212s X.\n\nThe grading convention is chosen so that it restricts to the one of \u00a74.4.2 when V is\na trivial virtual representation. The rth differential is a map\ns+r,V +(r\u22121)\n\ndr : E2s,V \u2192 E2\n\n.\n\nThe RO(G)-graded slice spectral sequence is a sum of spectral sequences, one for\neach element of RO(G)/Z. We will call the spectral sequence corresponding to\nthe coset V + Z \u2208 RO(G)/Z the slice spectral sequence for \u03c0VG+\u2217 X. This spectral\nsequence can be displayed on the (x, y)-plane, and we will do so following Adams\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n57\n\nconventions, with the term E2s,V +t displayed at a position with x-coordinate (V +\nt \u2212 s) and y-coordinate s. For an example, see Figures 2, 3 and 4 in \u00a79.\n4.6. Special slices. In this section we investigate special slices of spectra, and\nintroduce the notion of a spectrum with cellular slices, and of a pure G-spectrum.\nOur main result (Proposition 4.59) asserts that a map X \u2192 Y of G-spectra with\ncellular slices is a weak equivalence if and only if the underlying map of nonequivariant spectra is. This result plays an important role in the proof of the\nReduction Theorem in \u00a77. We also include material useful for investigating the\nslices of more general spectra.\n4.6.1. Slice positive spectra, 0-slices and (\u22121)-slices. In this section we will describe\nmethods for determining the slices of spectra, and introduce a convenient class of\nequivariant spectra. Our first results make use of the isotropy separation sequence\n(\u00a72.5.2) obtained by smashing with the cofibration sequence of pointed G-spaces\nEP+ \u2192 S 0 \u2192 \u1ebcP.\nThe space EP+ is an equivariant CW-complex built from G-cells of the form\n(G/H)+ \u2227 S n with H \u2282 G a proper subgroup. It follows that if W is a pointed Gspace whose H-fixed points are contractible for all proper H \u2282 G, then T G (EP+ , W )\nis contractible.\nLemma 4.46. Fix an integer d. If X is a G-spectrum with the property that\ni\u2217H X > d for all proper H \u2282 G, then EP+ \u2227 X > d.\nProof: Suppose that Z \u2264 d. Then\nSG (EP+ \u2227 X, Z) \u2248 T G (EP+ , SG (X, Z)).\n \u0304\n \u0304\nBy the assumption on X, the G-space SG (X, Z) has contractible H fixed points\n \u0304\nfor all proper H \u2282 G. The Lemma now follows from the remark preceding its\nstatement.\n\u0003\nLemma 4.47. Write g = |G|. The suspension spectrum of \u1ebcP is in SG\n\u2265g\u22121 .\nProof: The map \u1ebcP \u2227 S 0 \u2192 \u1ebcP \u2227 S \u03c1G \u22121 is a weak equivalence (Proposition 2.45\nand Remark 2.49). The suspension spectrum of \u1ebcP is in SG\n\u22650 , since it is (\u22121)connected (Proposition 4.11). So \u1ebcP \u2227 S \u03c1G \u22121 \u2265 g \u2212 1 by Proposition 4.26.\n\u0003\nProposition 4.48. A G-spectrum X is slice positive if and only if it is (\u22121) connected and \u03c00u X = 0 (i.e.,the non-equivariant spectrum i\u22170 X underlying X is 0connected).\nProof: The only if assertion follows from the fact that the slice cells of positive\ndimension are (\u22121)-connected and have 0-connected underlying spectra. The \"if\"\nassertion is proved by induction on |G|, the case of the trivial group being trivial.\nFor the induction step we may assume X is (\u22121)-connected and has the property\nthat i\u2217H X > 0 for all proper H \u2282 G. Consider the isotropy separation sequence for\nX\nEP+ \u2227 X \u2192 X \u2192 \u1ebcP \u2227 X.\n\n\f58\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nThe leftmost term is slice-positive by Lemma 4.46, and the rightmost term is by\nPropositions 4.11 and 4.26, and Lemma 4.47. It follows that X is slice-positive. \u0003\nExample 4.49. Suppose that f : S \u2192 S \u2032 is a surjective map of G-sets. Proposition 4.48 implies that the suspension spectrum of the mapping cone of f is slice\npositive. This implies that if HM is an Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum which is a zero\nslice then for every surjective S \u2192 S \u2032 the map M (S \u2032 ) \u2192 M (S) is a monomorphism.\nThe proposition below shows that this is also a sufficient condition.\nProposition 4.50. i) A spectrum X is a (\u22121)-slice if and only if it is of the\nform X = \u03a3\u22121 HM , with M an arbitrary Mackey functor.\nii) A spectrum X is a 0-slice if and only if it is of the form HM with M a Mackey\nfunctor all of whose restriction maps are monomorphisms.\nRemark 4.51. The condition on M in ii) is that if S \u2192 S \u2032 is a surjective map\nof finite G-sets then M (S \u2032 ) \u2192 M (S) is a monomorphism. Let G act on G \u00d7 S\nand G \u00d7 S \u2032 through its left action on G. Then G \u00d7 S \u2192 G \u00d7 S \u2032 has a section,\nso M (G \u00d7 S \u2032 ) \u2192 M (G \u00d7 S) is always a monomorphism. Using this one easily\nchecks that condition is also equivalent to requiring that for every finite G-set S \u2032 ,\nthe map M (S \u2032 ) \u2192 M (G \u00d7 S \u2032 ), induced by the action mapping G \u00d7 S \u2032 \u2192 S \u2032 , is a\nmonomorphism.\nProof: The first assertion is immediate from Proposition 4.20, which, combined\nwith part i) of Proposition 4.40, also shows that a 0-slice is an Eilenberg-MacLane\nspectrum. Example 4.49 gives the \"only if\" part of the second assertion. For the\n\"if\" part, suppose that M is a Mackey functor all of whose restrictions maps are\nmonomorphisms, and consider the sequence\nP1 HM \u2192 HM \u2192 P 0 HM.\nSince P1 HM \u2265 0 it is (\u22121)-connected, and so P1 HM is an Eilenberg-MacLane\nspectrum. For convenience, write\nM \u2032 = \u03c0 0 P1 HM\nM \u2032\u2032 = \u03c0 0 P 0 HM\nso that there is a short exact sequence\nM \u2032 \u058c M \u0589 M \u2032\u2032 .\nSuppose that S is any finite G-set and consider the following diagram\nM \u2032 (S)\n\n/ M (S)\n\n/ M \u2032\u2032 (S)\n\n\u000f\nM \u2032 (G \u00d7 S)\n\n\u000f\n/ M (G \u00d7 S)\n\n\u000f\n/ M \u2032\u2032 (G \u00d7 S)\n\nin which the rows are short exact, and the vertical maps are induced by the action\nmapping, as in Remark 4.51. The bottom right arrow is an isomorphism since\ni\u22170 HM \u2192 i\u22170 P 0 HM is an equivalence. Thus M \u2032 (G \u00d7 S) = 0 (this also follows from\n\u0003\nProposition 4.48). The claim now follows from a simple diagram chase.\nRemark 4.52. The second assertion of Proposition 4.50 can also be deduced directly\nfrom Corollary 3.6.\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n59\n\nCorollary 4.53. If X = HM is a zero slice and \u03c00u X = 0 then X is contractible.\n\u0003\nCorollary 4.54. The (\u22121)-slice of S \u22121 is \u03a3\u22121 HA. The zero slice of S 0 is HZ.\nProof: The first assertion follows easily from Part i) of Proposition 4.50. For the\nsecond assertion note that the S 0 \u2192 HA is a P 0 -equivalence, so the zero slice of\nS 0 is P 0 HA. Consider the fibration sequence\nHI \u2192 HA \u2192 HZ,\nin which I = ker A \u2192 Z is the augmentation ideal. The leftmost term is slice\npositive by Proposition 4.48, and the rightmost term is in SG\n\u22640 by Proposition 4.50.\nThe claim now follows from Lemma 4.16.\n\u0003\nb\nCorollary 4.55.

Suppose that f : X \u2192 Y is a map of cellular d-slices and \u03c0du f is an\nisomorphism. Then f is a weak equivalence.\nProof: The proof is by induction on |G|. If G is the trivial group, the result is\nobvious since X and Y are Eilenberg-MacLane spectra. Now suppose we know the\nresult for all proper H \u2282 G, and consider the map of isotropy separation sequences\nEP+ \u2227 X\n\n/X\n\n/ \u1ebcP \u2227 X\n\n\u000f\nEP+ \u2227 Y\n\n\u000f\n/Y\n\n\u000f\n/ \u1ebcP \u2227 Y .\n\nBy the induction hypothesis, the left vertical map is a weak equivalence.

Smashing with S 1 in case d = \u22121 we\nreduce to the case d = 0 and therefore assume that X = HM0 and Y = HM1 with\nM0 and M1 permutation Mackey functors.

The bottom arrow is an isomorphism by assumption. The vertical maps are monomorphisms by Proposition 4.50. The left\nvertical map is an isomorphism since M is a permutation Mackey functor (part ii)\nof Lemma 3.3). The result follows.\n\u0003\nProposition 4.62.

The special case in which G is a finite 2-group. In this section we record\nsome results which are special to the case in which G has order a power of 2. The\nresults about even slices are used in the proof of the Reduction Theorem in \u00a77.2.\nThe results on odd slices were used in an earlier approach to the main results of\nthis paper, but are no longer. We include them here because they provide useful\ntools for investigating slices of various spectra. Throughout this section the group\nG will be a finite 2-group.\nSuppose that X is a G-spectrum with the property that \u03c0du X is a free abelian\ngroup. In \u00a75.3 we will define a refinement of \u03c0du X to be a map\nc\u2192X\nc:W\n\n\f62\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C.

The result now follows from Proposition 4.62, since\nthe only prime dividing |G| is 2.\n\u0003\nProposition 4.64 gives some control over the even slices of a G-spectrum X when\nG is a 2-group. The odd slices are something of a different story, and getting at\nthem requires some knowledge of the equivariant homotopy type of X. Note that\nby Proposition 4.50 any Mackey functor can occur in an odd slice. On the other\nhand, only special ones can occur in even slices.\nCorollary 4.65. If Sb is a slice cell of odd dimension d, then for any X,\nb X]G \u2248 [S,\nb Pdd X]G .\n[S,\n\nProof: Since the formation of Pdd X commutes with the functors i\u2217H , induction\non |G| reduces us to the case when Sb is not an induced slice cell. So we may assume\nSb = S m\u03c1G \u22121 . Smashing Sb and X with S \u2212m\u03c1G , and using Corollary 4.25 reduces to\nthe case m = 0, which is given by Proposition 4.20.\n\u0003\n\nThe situation most of interest to us in this paper is when the odd slices are\ncontractible. Proposition 4.66 below gives a useful criterion.\n\nProposition 4.66. For a G spectrum X and an odd integer d, the following are\nequivalent:\ni) The d-slice of X is contractible;\nb X]G = 0.\nii) For every slice cell Sb of dimension d, [S,\n\nProof: By Corollary 4.65 (which requires d to be odd), there is an isomorphism\nb X]G = [S,\nb P d X]G .\n[S,\nd\n\nBy Lemma 4.14, the vanishing of this group implies that Pdd X < d and hence must\nbe contractible, since it is also \u2265 d.\n\u0003\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n63\n\nCorollary 4.67. Suppose that d is odd. If X \u2192 Y \u2192 Z is a cofibration sequence,\nand the d-slices of X and Z are contractible, then the d-slice of Y is contractible.\nProof: This is immediate from Proposition 4.66 and the long exact sequence of\nhomotopy classes of maps.\n\u0003\nRemark 4.68. Using the slice spectral sequence one can easily show that a pure\nspectrum always admits a refinement of homotopy groups. Thus the results above\nsay that a spectrum X is pure if and only if the even homotopy groups admit an\nH\nequivariant refinement, and the \"slice homotopy groups\" \u03c0m\u03c1\nX are all zero\nH \u22121\nwhenever H \u2282 G is non-trivial.\n4.7. Further multiplicative properties of the slice filtration. In this section\nwe show that the slice filtration has the expected multiplicative properties for pure\nspectra. Our main result is Proposition 4.69 below. It has the consequence that if\nX and Y are pure spectra, and Ers,t ( \u2212 ) is the slice spectral sequence, then there\nis a map of spectral sequences\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nErs,t (X) \u2297 Ers ,t (Y ) \u2192 Ers+s ,t+t (X \u2227 Y )\nrepresenting the pairing \u03c0 \u2217 X \u2227 \u03c0 \u2217 Y \u2192 \u03c0 \u2217 (X \u2227 Y ). In other words, multiplication\nin the slice spectral sequence of pure spectra behaves in the expected manner. We\nleave the deduction of this property from Proposition 4.69 to the reader.\nProposition 4.69. If X \u2265 n is pure and Y \u2265 m has cellular slices, then X \u2227 Y \u2265\nn + m.\nProof: We need to show that P n+m\u22121 (X \u2227 Y ) is contractible. By Lemma 4.30\nthe map\nX \u2227 Y \u2192 P n+m\u22121 X \u2227 P n+m\u22121 Y\nis a P n+m\u22121 -equivalence, so we may reduce to the case in which the slice filtrations\nof X and Y are finite. That case in turn reduces to the situation in which\nb\nK)\nX = HZ \u2227 S(m,\nY = HZ \u2227 Sb\u2032\n\nin which Sb\u2032 is any slice cell. By induction on |G| the assertion further reduces to\nthe case in which neither Sb nor Sb\u2032 is induced. Thus we may assume\nX = HZ \u2227 S k\u03c1G\nY = HZ \u2227 S l\u03c1G\n\nor HZ \u2227 \u03a3\u22121 S l\u03c1G ,\n\nin which case the result follows from Proposition 4.26.\n\n\u0003\n\n5.

Real bordism, real orientations and formal groups. We begin by reviewing work of Araki [6] and Hu-Kriz [35] on real bordism.\n5.2.1. The formal group. Consider CPn and CP\u221e as pointed C2 -spaces under the\naction of complex conjugation, with CP0 as the base point. The fixed point spaces\nare RPn and RP\u221e . There are homeomorphisms\n(5.3)\n\nCPn /CPn\u22121 \u2261 S n\u03c12 ,\n\nand in particular an identification CP1 \u2261 S \u03c12 .\nDefinition 5.4 (Araki [6]). Let E be a C2 -equivariant homotopy commutative ring\n\u03c12\nspectrum. A real orientation of E is a class x\u0304 \u2208 \u1ebcC\n(CP\u221e ) whose restriction to\n2\n\u03c12\n\u03c12\n0\n(pt)\n\u1ebcC\n(CP1 ) = \u1ebcC\n(S \u03c12 ) \u2248 EC\n2\n2\n2\n\nis the unit. A real oriented spectrum is a C2 -equivariant ring spectrum E equipped\nwith a real orientation.\nIf (E, x\u0304) is a real oriented spectrum and f : E \u2192 E \u2032 is an equivariant multiplicative map, then\nf\u2217 (x\u0304) \u2208 (E \u2032 )\u03c12 (CP\u221e )\nis a real orientation of E \u2032 . We will often not distinguish in notation between x\u0304 and\nf\u2217 x\u0304.\nExample 5.5. The zero section CP\u221e \u2192 M U (1) is an equivariant equivalence, and\ndefines a real orientation\nx\u0304 \u2208 M UR\u03c12 (CP\u221e ),\nmaking M UR into a real oriented spectrum.\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n65\n\nExample 5.6. From the map\nM UR \u2192 i\u22171 M U ((G))\nprovided by (5.1), the spectrum i\u22171 M U ((G)) gets a real orientation which we'll also\ndenote\nx\u0304 \u2208 (M U ((G)) )\u03c12 (CP\u221e ).\nExample 5.7.

For information beyond the discussion below, see [6, 35].\nRemark 5.9. A real orientation x\u0304 corresponds to a coordinate on the corresponding\nformal group. Because of this we will use the terms interchangeably, preferring\n\"coordinate\" when the discussion predominantly concerns the formal group, and\n\"real orientation\" when it concerns spectra.\nThe standard formulae from the theory of formal groups give elements in the\nRO(C2 )-graded homotopy groups \u03c0\u22c6C2 E of real oriented E. For example, there is a\nmap from the Lazard ring to \u03c0\u22c6C2 E classifying the formal group law. Using Quillen's\ntheorem to identify the Lazard ring with the complex cobordism ring this map can\nbe written as\nM U\u2217 \u2192 \u03c0\u22c6C2 E.\nC2\nE.

Refinement of homotopy groups. We begin by focusing on a simple consequence of Proposition 5.11.\nProposition 5.27.

Our goal in this section is to formulate a generalization\nto the case G = C2n .\nDefinition 5.28. Suppose X is a G-spectrum. A refinement of \u03c0ku X is a map\nc\u2192X\nc:W\n\nc is a wedge of slice cells of dimension k, inducing an isomorphism\nin which W\nc \u2192 \u03c0 u X.\n\u03c0u W\nk\n\nk\n\nA refinement of the homotopy groups of X (or a refinement of homotopy of X) is a\nmap\n_\nc=\nck \u2192 X\nW\nW\nck is a refinement of \u03c0 u .\nwhose restriction to each W\nk\n\nRemark 5.29. Let \u03c3G (Z) be the sign representation of G on Z. There is an Gu\nmodule isomorphism \u03c0|G|\nS \u03c1G \u2248 \u03c3G (Z), and more generally\n\u0001\n\u2297n\nu\nG+ \u2227 S n\u03c1H \u2248 indG\n.\n\u03c0n|H|\nH \u03c3H (Z)\nH\n\nThis implies that when k is even, a necessary condition for \u03c0ku X to admit a refinement is that it be isomorphic as a G-module to a sum\nM\nMH,k\nH\u2282G\n\n\u0001\n\u2297l\nwhere MH,k is zero unless |H| divides k and is a sum of copies of indG\nH \u03c3H (Z)\nwhen k = l|H|. Adding the further condition that for every H \u2282 G, with k = l|H|,\nH\nevery element in \u03c0ku X transforming in \u03c3H (Z)\u2297l refines to an element of \u03c0l\u03c1\nX\nH\nmakes it sufficient.

Using Remark 5.29 one can check that a refinement of \u03c0ku X consists\nof isotropic slice cells if and only if \u03c0ku X does not contain a free G-module as a\nsummand.\nThe splitting (5.12) used to prove Proposition 5.27 is multiplicative. This too\nhas an important analogue.\nDefinition 5.31. Suppose that R is an equivariant associative algebra. A mulc \u2192 R which,\ntiplicative refinement of homotopy is an associative algebra map W\nwhen regarded as a map of G-spectra is a refinement of homotopy.\nProposition 5.32.

The first, Lemma 5.33 below,\nis a description of \u03c0\u2217u M U ((G)) as a G-module. The computation is of interest in its\nown right, and is used elsewhere\npaper. It is proved in \u00a75.4. The second is\nVmin this((G))\nthe classical description of \u03c0\u2217u (\nMU\n), m > 1, as a \u03c0\u2217u M U ((G)) -module.\n\nu\nLemma 5.33. There is a sequence of elements ri \u2208 \u03c02i\nM U ((G)) with the property\nthat\n\n(5.34)\n\n\u03c0\u2217u M U ((G)) = Z2 [G * r1 , G * r2 , . . . ],\n\nin which G * ri stands for the sequence\ng\n\n(ri , . . . \u03b3 2 \u22121 ri )\nof length g/2.\nu\nM U ((G))\nWe refer to the condition (5.34) by saying that the elements ri \u2208 \u03c02i\nu\n((G))\nform a set of G-algebra generators for \u03c0\u2217 M U\n.\n\nRemark 5.35. Lemma 5.33 completely describes \u03c0\u2217u M U ((G)) as a representation of\nG. To spell it out, recall from Remark 5.14 that the action of the generator of C2\ng\nu\nu\non \u03c02i\nM U ((G)) is by (\u22121)i . The elements ri \u2208 \u03c02i\nM U ((G)) therefore satisfy \u03b3 2 ri =\n(\u22121)i ri and transform in the representation induced from the sign representation\nof C2 if i is odd and in the representation induced from the trivial representation\nof C2 if i is even. Lemma 5.33 implies that the map from the symmetric algebras\non the sum of these representations to \u03c0\u2217u M U ((G)) is an isomorphism.\nu\nRemark 5.36. The fact that the action of C2 on \u03c02i\nM U ((G)) is either a sum of sign\nor trivial representations means that it cannot contain a summand which is free.\nThe same is therefore true of the G-action. By Remark 5.30 this implies that only\nu\nisotropic slice cells may occur in a refinement of \u03c02i\nM U ((G)).\n\nOver \u03c0\u2217u M U ((G)) \u2227 M U ((G)), there are two formal group laws, FL and FR coming\nfrom the canonical orientations of the left and right factors.

If\nnot for the fact that G acts on both factors of i\u22170 M U ((G)), the first assertion would\nalso follow immediately from the K\u00fcnneth formula and the usual description of\nM U\u2217 M U . The quickest way to deduce it from the apparatus we have describe so\nfar is to let G \u2282 G\u2032 be an embedding of index 2 into a cyclic group, write\n\u2032\n\nM U ((G)) \u2227 M U ((G)) \u2248 i\u2217G M U ((G ))\nand use Corollary 5.20.\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 5.38. As with Lemma 5.33, the lemma above actually determines the\nstructure of \u03c0\u2217u M U ((G)) \u2227 M U ((G)) as a G-equivariant \u03c0\u2217u M U ((G))-algebra.

To keep the notation\nu\nsimple we begin with the case m = 1. Choose a sequence ri \u2208 \u03c02i\nM U ((G)) with the\nproperty described in Lemma 5.33.

Using Lemma 5.33 one then easily checks that (5.40)\nis multiplicative refinement of homotopy.

The top row is therefore a\ncofibration sequence by Corollary 4.17, and so the rightmost vertical map is a weak\nequivalence. This completes the inductive step, and the proof.\n\u0003\n7. The Reduction Theorem\nWe will prove the Reduction Theorem by induction on g = |G|. The case in which\nG is the trivial group follows from Quillen's results.

By construction the image of yk in \u03c0cGk \u03c1G EP+ \u2227 Mk maps to\nzero in \u03c0cGk \u03c1G Mk . It therefore comes from a class\n\u1ef9k \u2208 \u03c0cGk \u03c1G +1 \u1ebcP \u2227 Mk .\nThe image of \u1ef9k in \u03c0cGk \u03c1G +1 \u1ebcP \u2227 HZ(2) is non-zero since it has a non-zero image in\n\u03c0cGk \u03c1G EP+ \u2227 HZ(2)\nby Proposition 7.12.

In particular, the map\nEP+ \u2227 M U ((G)) \u2192 EP+ \u2227 HZ(2)\n\n(7.13)\n\ncan be studied by smashing the slice tower of M U ((G)) with EP+ .\nWe can cut down some the size of things by making use of the spectra introduced\nin \u00a77.2.

Since 1 < m < ck g all of these cells are induced. This implies that\nthe map\ncm \u2192 HZ \u2227 W\ncm\nEP+ \u2227 HZ \u2227 W\nis an equivalence, since\nEP+ \u2192 S 0\nis an equivalence after restricting to any proper subgroup of G.

This proves the first assertion. It implies\nthat the map\n\u03c0cGk \u03c1G EP+ \u2227 Pck g R(ck \u2212 1) \u2192 \u03c0cGk \u03c1G EP+ \u2227 P1 R(ck \u2212 1)\n\nis surjective. As mentioned in \u00a77.2, Proposition 4.64 implies that P00 R(ck \u2212 1) =\nHZ(2) , and so the second assertion follows from the exact sequence of the fibration\nEP+ \u2227 P1 R(ck \u2212 1) \u2192 EP+ \u2227 R(ck \u2212 1) \u2192 EP+ \u2227 P00 R(ck \u2212 1).\n\u0003\n\n\f86\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nThe exact sequence in Lemma 7.14 converts the problem of showing that yk has\nnon-zero image in \u03c0cGk \u03c1G EP+ \u2227 HZ(2) to showing that it is not in the image of\n\u03c0cGk \u03c1G EP+ \u2227 Pck g R(ck \u2212 1).\nWe now isolate a property of this image that is not shared by yk . Recall that \u03b3 is\na fixed generator of G.\nProposition 7.15. The image of\ni\u2217\n\n0\n\u03c0cuk g R(ck \u2212 1)\n\u03c0cGk \u03c1G EP+ \u2227 Pck g R(ck \u2212 1) \u2192 \u03c0cGk \u03c1G R(ck \u2212 1) \u2212\u2192\n\nis contained in the image of (1 \u2212 \u03b3).\nThe class yk does not have the property described in Proposition 7.15. Its image\nin \u03c0cuk g R(ck \u2212 1) is i\u22170 N r\u0304ck which generates a sign representation of G occurring as\na summand of \u03c0cuk g R(ck \u2212 1). Thus once Proposition 7.15 is proved the proof of the\nReduction Theorem is complete.\nThe proof of Proposition 7.15 makes use of the RO(G)-graded Mackey functor\n\u03c0 ck \u03c1G (X)\nand the transfer map\n(7.16)\n\n\u03c0 ck \u03c1G (X)(C2 ) \u2192 \u03c0 ck \u03c1G (X)(pt),\n\nin which C2 is regarded as a finite G-set through the unique surjective map G \u2192\nC2 . By definition (\u00a73.1) of the covariant part \u03c0 ck \u03c1G \u2217 of the Mackey functor, the\nmap (7.16) is given by the map of equivariant homotopy groups\n\u03c0cGk \u03c1G (X \u2227 C2 + ) \u2192 \u03c0cGk \u03c1G (X)\ninduced by the unique surjective map C2 \u2192 pt.\nThere are two steps in the proof of Proposition 7.15. First it is shown (Corollary 7.19) that the image of\n\u03c0cGk \u03c1G EP+ \u2227 Pck g R(ck \u2212 1) \u2192 \u03c0cGk \u03c1G R(ck \u2212 1)\nis contained in the image of the transfer map just described. We then show\n(Lemma 7.20) that the image of the transfer map in \u03c0cuk g R(ck \u2212 1) is in the image\nof (1 \u2212 \u03b3).\nLemma 7.17. Let M \u2265 0 be a G-spectrum, and regard C2 as a finite G-set using\nthe unique surjective map G \u2192 C2 . The image of\n\u03c00G EP+ \u2227 M \u2192 \u03c00G M\nis the image of the transfer map\n\u03c00G M \u2227 C2 + \u2192 \u03c00G M.\nProof: As mentioned in Remark 2.48, the space EP+ can be taken to be the space\n\u221e\nS+\non which \u03b3 acts through the antipodal action. The standard cell decomposition\nin this model has 0-skeleton C2 + . Since M is (\u22121)-connected (Proposition 4.11)\nthis implies that \u03c00G C2+ \u2227M \u2192 \u03c00G EP+ \u2227M is surjective, and the claim follows. \u0003\nCorollary 7.18.

The Gap Theorem\nThe proof of the Gap Theorem was sketched in the introduction, and various\nsupporting details were scattered throughout the paper.

Suppose that G = C2n is a non-trivial group, and m \u2265 0. Then\ni\nHG\n(S m\u03c1G ; Z(2) ) = 0\n\nfor 0 < i < 4.\n\u0003\n\nLemma 8.2 (The Cell Lemma). Let G = C2n for some n > 0. If Sb is an isotropic\nslice cell of even dimension, then the groups \u03c0kG HZ(2) \u2227 Sb are zero for \u22124 < k < 0.\nProof: Suppose that\n\nSb = G+ \u2227 S m\u03c1H\nH\n\nwith H \u2282 G non-trivial.

If m \u2265 0 then\n\u03c0kG HZ(2) \u2227 Sb = 0 for k < 0. For the case m < 0 write i = \u2212k, m\u2032 = \u2212m > 0, and\n\u2032\n\ni\n(S m \u03c1G ; Z(2) ).\n\u03c0kG HZ(2) \u2227 Sb = HG\n\nThe result then follows from Proposition 8.1.\n\n\u0003\n\nTheorem 8.3.

From the associative algebra equivalence\n_\nPkk M U ((G)) \u223c HZ \u2227 S 0 [G.r\u03041 , . . . ]\nk\u2208Z\n\nthis is equivalent to identifying the summand of non-induced slice cells in the twisted\nmonoid ring\nS 0 [G * r\u03041 , . . . ].\n\nSince the smash product of an induced spectrum with any spectrum is induced, we\ncan do this by identifying the summand of non-induced slice cells in each\nS 0 [G * r\u0304i ]\nand smashing them together.\nTake the generating inclusion\nr\u0304i : S i\u03c1C2 \u2192 S 0 [r\u0304i ],\napply NCG2 to obtain\nN r\u0304i : S i\u03c1G \u2192 S 0 [G * r\u0304i ],\nand extend it to an associative algebra map\nS 0 [N r\u0304i ] \u2192 S 0 [G * r\u0304i ].\n\n(9.3)\n\nLemma 9.4. The map (9.3) is the inclusion of the summand of non-induced slice\ncells.\nProof: The distributive law expresses S 0 [G * r\u0304i ] = NCG2 S 0 [r\u0304i ] as an indexed wedge\n(see \u00a72.4)\n_\nS Vf ,\nS 0 [G * r\u0304i ] \u2248\nf :G/C2 \u2192N0\n\nLg/2\n\nand Vf = i=1 \u03b3 i f (\u03b3 i )\u03c1C2 . We now decompose the right hand side into an ordinary\nwedge over the G-orbits. Since an indexed wedge over a G-orbit is induced from\nthe stabilizer of any element of the orbit, the summand of non-induced slice cells\nconsists of those f which are constant. If f : G/C2 is the constant function with\nvalue n, then Vf = n\u03c1G , so the summand of non-induced slice cells is\n_\nS n\u03c1G .\nn\n\nThe result follows easily from this.\nSmashing these together gives\n\n\u0003\n\n\f94\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nCorollary 9.5. The associative algebra map\nS 0 [N r\u03041 , . . . ] \u2192 S 0 [G * r\u03041 , . . . ]\nis the inclusion of the summand of non-induced slice cells.\nTo put this all together, consider the Z \u00d7 RO(G)-graded ring\nZ(2) [a, fi , u]/(2a, 2fi )\nwith\n|a| = (1, 1 \u2212 \u03c3)\n|fi | = (i(g \u2212 1), ig)\n|u| = (0, 2 \u2212 2\u03c3).\nDefine a map\n(9.6)\n\nZ(2) [a, fi , u]/(2a, 2fi ) \u2192\n\nM\n\nE2s,t\n\ns,k\u22650\nt\u2208\u2217\u2212k\u03c3\n\nby\ni(g\u22121),ig\n\nfi 7\u2192 ai\u03c1\u0304 N r\u0304i \u2208 E2\n\nig\nM U ((G))\n= \u03c0iG Pig\n\na 7\u2192 a\u03c3 \u2208 E21,1\u2212\u03c3 = \u03c0\u2212\u03c3 P00 0M U ((G))\nand by sending u to the element u \u2208 E20,2\u22122\u03c3 described at the beginning of this\nsection. The combination of Lemmas 9.1 and 9.4 gives\nProposition 9.7.

By construction, the fi are the representatives\nat the E2 -term of the slice spectral sequence of the elements defined in Definition 5.51 (and also called fi ). They are therefore permanent cycles. Similarly, the\nelement a is the representative of a\u03c3 and also a permanent cycle. This leaves the\npowers of u. The case G = C2 of the following result appears in unpublished work\nof Araki and in Hu-Kriz [35].\nTheorem 9.9 (Slice Differentials Theorem). In the slice spectral sequence for\nk\u22121\n\u03c0\u22c6G M U ((G)) the differentials di u2\nare zero for i < r = 1 + (2k \u2212 1)g, and\nk\u22121\n\ndr u2\n\nk\n\n= a2 f2k \u22121 .\n\nRemark 9.10. It follows from Proposition 9.7 that what lies on the \"vanishing line\"\n\u0001\ns = (g \u2212 1) (t \u2212 s) + k\u03c3 + k\n\nis the algebra\n\nZ(2) [a, fi ]/(2a, 2fi ).\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n95\n\nIn Proposition 5.50 it was shown that the kernel of the map\nZ(2) [a\u03c3 , fi ]/(2a, 2fi ) \u2192 \u03c0\u22c6G M U ((G)) \u2192 \u03c0\u22c6G \u03a6G M U ((G)) = \u03c0\u2217 M O[a\u00b11\n\u03c3 ]\nis the ideal (2, f1 , f3 , f7 , . . . ). The only possible non-trivial differentials into the\nvanishing line must therefore land in this ideal.\nFor the proof of Theorem 9.9 the reader may find it helpful to consult Figure 4.\nProof of Theorem 9.9: We establish the differential by induction on k. Assume\nthe result for k \u2032 < k. Then what's left in the range s \u2265 (g \u2212 1)(t \u2212 s \u2212 k) after the\ndifferentials assumed by induction is the sum of two modules over Z(2) [fi ]/(2fi ).\nk\nOne is generated by a2 and is free over the quotient ring\nZ/2[fi ]/(f1 , f3 , . . . , f2k\u22121 \u22121 ).\nk\u22121\n\nThe other is generated by u2 . Since the differential must take its value in the\nk\u22121\nideal (2, a, f1 , f3 , . . . ), the next (and only) possible differential on u2\nis the one\n2k\u22121\nasserted in the theorem. So all we need do is show that the classes u\ndo not\nsurvive the spectral sequence. For this it suffices to do so after inverting a. Consider\nthe map\nG\n((G))\nG\na\u22121\n\u2192 a\u22121\n\u03c3 \u03c0\u22c6 M U\n\u03c3 \u03c0\u22c6 HZ(2) .\nWe know the Z-graded homotopy groups of both sides, since they can be identified\nk\u22121\nwith the homotopy groups of the geometric fixed point spectrum. If u2\nis a\nk\nk\u22121\npermanent cycle, then the class a\u22122 u2\nis as well, and represents a class with\n\u0003\nnon-zero image in \u03c0\u2217G \u03a6G HZ(2) . This contradicts Proposition 7.6.\nRemark 9.11. After inverting a\u03c3 , the differentials described in Theorem 9.9 describe\ncompletely the RO(G)-graded slice spectral sequence. The spectral sequence starts\nfrom\nZ/2[fi , a\u00b11 , u].\nk\u22121\n\nThe class u2\n\nhits a unit multiple of f2k \u22121 , and so the E\u221e -term is\nZ/2[fi , i 6= 2k \u2212 1][a\u00b11 ] = M O\u2217 [a\u00b11 ]\n\nwhich we know to be the correct answer since \u03a6G M U ((G)) = M O. This also shows\nk\u22121\nthat the class u2\nis a permanent cycle modulo (r\u03042k \u22121 ). This fact corresponds to\nthe main computation in the proof of Theorem 6.5 (which, of course we used in the\nabove proof). The logic can be reversed, and in [35] the results are established in\nthe reverse order (for the group G = C2 ).\nWrite\n((G))\nG\n,\nd\u0304k = N r\u03042k \u22121 \u2208 \u03c0(2\nk \u22121)\u03c1 M U\nG\n\nand note that with this notation\nk\n\nf2k \u22121 = a\u03c1\u03042\n\n\u22121\n\nd\u0304k .\n\nIn the proof of the corollary below we will make use of the identity\n(9.12)\n\nk+1\n\nf2k+1 \u22121 d\u0304k = a2\u03c1\u0304\nk\n\nThe map d\u0304k : S (2\n\n\u22121)\u03c1G\n\n\u22121\n\nk\n\nd\u0304k+1 d\u0304k = f2k \u22121 a2\u03c1\u0304 d\u0304k+1 .\n\n\u2192 M U ((G)) is represented at the E2 -term of the RO(G)k\n\ngraded slice spectral sequence by a map S (2\n\n\u22121)\u03c1G\n\n(2k\u22121 )g\n\n\u2192 P(2k\u22121 )g M U ((G)) which we\n\n\f96\n\nM.

In the RO(G)-graded slice spectral sequence for M U ((G)) , the class\nk\nd\u0304k u2 is a permanent cycle.\nProof: Write\nr = 1 + (2k+1 \u2212 1)g.\nk\n\nk\n\nTheorem 9.9 implies that differentials di (d\u0304k u2 ) = d\u0304k di (u2 ) are zero for i < r, and\nk\n\nk+1\n\nk+1\n\ndr (d\u0304k u2 ) = d\u0304k a2\n\nf2k+1 \u22121 = a2\n\nk\n\nf2k \u22121 a2\u03c1\u0304 d\u0304k+1 ,\n\nthe second equality coming from (9.12) above.

The target of the remaining differentials work out\nto be in a region of the spectral sequence which is already zero at the E2 -term. So\nonce we check this, the proof is complete.\nTo check the claim about the vanishing region first note that with our conventions, differential di+1 of the RO(G)-graded slice spectral sequence maps a subquotient of\nG n\n\u03c0m\nPn X\nto a sub-quotient of\nn+i\nG\nPn+i\nX.\n\u03c0m\u22121\nThe class in question starts out at the E2 -term as\n(2k \u22121)g\n\nk\n\nd\u0304k u2 \u2208 \u03c02Gk (2\u22122\u03c3)+(2k \u22121)\u03c1G P(2k \u22121)g M U ((G))\nso we are interested in the groups\n(2k \u22121)g+i\n\n\u03c02Gk (2\u22122\u03c3)+(2k \u22121)\u03c1G \u22121 P(2k \u22121)g+i M U ((G))\nor, equivalently\nk+1\n\n\u03c02Gk+1 \u22121 S 2\n\n\u03c3\n\nk\n\n\u2227 S \u2212(2\n\n\u22121)\u03c1G\n\n(2k \u22121)g+i\n\n\u2227 P(2k \u22121)g+i M U ((G))\n\nwith i + 1 > r = 1 + (2k+1 \u2212 1)g.

Periodicity theorems. We now turn to our main periodicity theorem. As\nwill be apparent to the reader, the technique can be used to get a much more\ngeneral result. We have chosen to focus on a case which contains what is needed\nfor the proof of Theorem 1.1, and yet can be stated for general G = C2n .\nOur motivating example is the spectrum KR of \"real\" K-theory [7]. Multiplication by the real Bott class r\u03041 \u2208 \u03c0\u03c12 KR is an isomorphism, giving KR an S \u03c12 periodicity. On the other hand, the representation 4\u03c12 admits a Spin structure, and\nthe construction of the KO-orientation of Spin bundles leads to a \"Thom\" class\nu \u2208 \u03c08C2 KR \u2227 S 4\u03c12 . This class is represented at the E2 -term of the slice spectral\nsequence by u4\u03c12 . Multiplication by r\u030414 u is then an equivariant map S 8 \u2227 KR \u2192 KR\nwhose underlying map of non-equivariant spectra is an equivalence. It therefore\ngives an equivalence S 8 \u2227 KRhC2 \u2248 KRhC2 . Since the map KO \u2192 KRhC2 is an equivalence, this gives the 8-fold periodicity of KO.\nIn our situation we begin with an equivariant commutative ring R, a representation V of G, and an element D \u2208 \u03c0VG R. We manually create a spectrum with\nS V -periodicity by working with the homotopy colimit, D\u22121 R, of the sequence\nD\n\nD\n\nR \u2212\u2192 S \u2212V \u2227 R \u2212\u2192 S \u22122V \u2227 R \u2192 * * * .\nThe unit inclusion\nS 0 \u2192 D\u22121 R\ngives a map\nHZ = P00 S 0 \u2192 P00 D\u22121 R\nand hence defines, for every oriented representation W of G, elements\nuW \u2208 \u03c0dim W \u2212W P00 R = E20,dim W \u2212W\nin the E2 -term of the RO(G)-graded slice spectral sequence for \u03c0\u22c6G D\u22121 R. We\nwill show, under certain hypotheses on D, that there is an integer k > 0 with\nthe property that ukV is a permanent cycle. Let u \u2208 \u03c0\u22c6G D\u22121 R be any element\nrepresenting ukV .

There are some easy general things to say at first. The spectrum\n\n\f98\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nD\u22121 R is certainly an R-module, and inherits a homotopy commutative multiplication (over R) from R. The technique of [22, \u00a7VIII.4] can be used to show that\nthe non-equivariant spectrum underlying D\u22121 R has a unique commutative algebra\nstructure for which the map i\u22170 R \u2192 i\u22170 D\u22121 R is a map of commutative rings.\nWith an additional assumption on D, one can go further.

This allows one to form norms of elements\nin \u03c0\u22c6H D\u22121 R as if D\u22121 R were an equivariant commutative ring.\nA necessary condition for D\u22121 R to actually be an equivariant commutative ring,\nG \u2217\nis that for every H \u2282 G the norm NH\niH D divides a power of D. In fact the\ncondition is also sufficient. The proof of the result below is described in [29].\nProposition 9.15. Let R be an equivariant commutative ring and D \u2208 \u03c0\u22c6G R.

The Homotopy Fixed Point Theorem\nUntil now we haven't had occasion to refer to the function G-spectrum of maps\nfrom a pointed G-space S to a G-spectrum X, which exists as part of the completeness of SG as a topological G-category. We will write X S for this object, so\n \u0304\nthat\nSG (Z, X S ) = SG (Z \u2227 S, X).\nDefinition 10.1. A G-spectrum X is cofree if the map\nX \u2192 X EG+\n\n(10.2)\n\nadjoint to the projection map EG+ \u2227 X \u2192 X is a weak equivalence.\nIf X is cofree then the map\n\u03c0\u2217G X \u2192 \u03c0\u2217G X EG+ = \u03c0\u2217 X hG\nis an isomorphism. The main result of this section (Theorem 10.8) asserts that any\nmodule over D\u22121 M U ((G)) is cofree.\nThe map (10.2) is an equivalence of underlying spectra, and hence becomes\nan equivalence after smashing with any G-CW spectrum built entirely out of free\nG-cells. In particular, the map\n(10.3)\n\n\u223c\n\nEG+ \u2227 X \u2212\n\u2192 EG+ \u2227 (X EG+ )\n\nis an equivariant equivalence. One exploits this, as in [14], by making use of the\npointed G-space \u1ebcG defined by the cofibration sequence\n(10.4)\n\nEG+ \u2192 S 0 \u2192 \u1ebcG.\n\nLemma 10.5. For a G-spectrum X, the following are equivalent:\ni) For all non-trivial H \u2282 G, the spectrum \u03a6H X is contractible.\nii) The map EG+ \u2227 X \u2192 X is a weak equivalence.\niii) The G-spectrum \u1ebcG \u2227 X is contractible.\nProof: The equivalence of the second and third conditions is immediate from the\ncofibration sequence defining \u1ebcG. Since EG+ is built from free G-cells, condition\nii) implies condition i). For H \u2282 G non-trivial, we have\n\u03a6H (\u1ebcG \u2227 X) \u2248 \u03a6H (\u1ebcG) \u2227 \u03a6H (X) \u2248 S 0 \u2227 \u03a6H (X).\nSince the non-equivariant spectrum underlying \u1ebcG is contractible, condition i)\ntherefore implies that \u03a6H (\u1ebcG \u2227 X) is contractible for all H \u2282 G. But this means\n\u0003\nthat \u1ebcG \u2227 X is contractible (Proposition 2.52).\nCorollary 10.6. If R is an equivariant ring spectrum satisfying the equivalent\nconditions of Lemma 10.5 then any module over R is cofree.\nThe condition of Corollary 10.6 requires R to be an equivariant ring spectrum\nin the weakest possible sense, namely that R possesses a unital multiplication (not\nnecessarily associative) in ho SG . Similarly, the \"module\" condition is also one\ntaking place in the homotopy category.\n\n\f102\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nProof: Let M be an R-module. Consider the diagram\nEG+ \u2227 M\n\n/M\n\n/ \u1ebcG \u2227 M\n\n\u000f\nEG+ \u2227 M EG+\n\n\u000f\n/ M EG+\n\n\u000f\n/ \u1ebcG \u2227 M EG+\n\n(10.7)\n\nobtained by smashing M \u2192 M EG+ with the sequence (10.4). The fact that R\nsatisfies the condition i) of Lemma 10.5 implies that any R-module M \u2032 does since\n\u03a6H (M ) is a retract of \u03a6H (R \u2227 M ) \u2248 \u03a6H (R) \u2227 \u03a6H (M ). Thus both M and M EG+\nsatisfy the conditions of Lemma 10.5, and the terms on the right in (10.7) are\ncontractible. The left vertical arrow is the weak equivalence (10.3). It follows that\nthe middle vertical arrow is a weak equivalence.\n\u0003\nTurning to our main purpose, we now consider a situation similar to the one in\n\u00a79.2, and fix a class\nG\nM U ((G))\nD \u2208 \u03c0l\u03c1\nG\nwith the property that for all non-trivial H \u2282 G the restriction of D to \u03c0\u2217H M U ((G))\nis divisible by d\u0304H\nk for some k which may depend on H.\nTheorem 10.8 (Homotopy Fixed Point Theorem).

The\nresult will then follow from Corollary 10.6. Suppose that H \u2282 G is non-trivial.\nThen\n\u03a6H (D\u22121 M U ((G))) \u2248 \u03a6H (D)\u22121 \u03a6H (M U ((G))).\nH\nBut D is divisible by d\u0304H\nk , and so \u03a6 (D) is divisible by\nH\nC2 H\nH\nH\n\u03a6H (d\u0304H\nk ) = \u03a6 (NC2 (r\u03042k \u22121 ))y = \u03a6 (r\u03042k \u22121 )\n\nwhich is zero by Proposition 5.50.

The Detection Theorem\n11.1. Outline of the proof. We now turn to the proof of the Detection Theorem.\nFor the convenience of the reader, we restate the result.\nTheorem 11.1 (The Detection Theorem). If \u03b8j \u2208 \u03c02j+1 \u22122 S 0 is an element of\nKervaire invariant 1, and j > 2, then the image of \u03b8j in \u03c02j+1 \u22122 \u03a9 is non-zero.\nTo recapitulate, we are working with the group G = C8 , and the spectrum \u03a9 is\nthe spectrum of G-fixed points in \u03a9O = D\u22121 M U ((G)), with D \u2208 \u03c019\u03c1 M U ((G)) the\nelement specified in Corollary 9.21.\nTheorem 11.2 (Algebraic Detection Theorem).

For j > 2, there is a map\nH 2 (C8 ; \u03c02j+1 \u03a9O ) \u2192 Q/Z\n\n(11.4)\nmaking the diagram\n(11.5)\n\nj+1\n\nExt2,2\nMU\u2217 MU (M U\u2217 , M U\u2217 )\n\n/ H 2 (C8 ; \u03c02j+1 \u03a9O )\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n/ Q/Z\n\nj+1\n\nExt2,2\nA\n\n(Z/2, Z/2)\n\n\u001f\u007f\n\ncommute.\nIn (11.5), the bottom row is the Kervaire invariant homomorphism sending h2j\nto 1/2. Since the vector space\nj+1\n\nExt2,2\nA\n\n(Z/2, Z/2)\n\nh2j\n\nhas dimension 1, with basis\n(Adams [3, Theorem 2.5.1]), the Kervaire invariant\nhomomorphism is completely specified by this property, and is a monomorphism. In\nplain language, Proposition 11.3 asserts that the Kervaire invariant homomorphism,\nthought of as a map\nj+1\n\nExt2,2\nMU\u2217 MU (M U\u2217 , M U\u2217 ) \u2192 Q/Z,\nfactors through H 2 (C8 , \u03c02j+1 \u03a9O ). This directly implies Theorem 11.2.\nRemark 11.6. All three of these results (Theorems 11.1 and 11.2, and Proposition 11.3) remain true without the restriction j > 2. The other cases j \u2264 2 require\nseparate arguments, and are not needed for the proof of Theorem 1.1, so we do not\ninclude them.\n\n\f104\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nWe now describe the proof of Proposition 11.3, deferring the details to later\nsubsections. In order to construct the map (11.4) we use of the theory of formal\nA-modules to construct a C8 -equivariant ring homomorphism from \u03c0\u2217u \u03a9O to much\nsmaller ring. Let A = Z2 [\u03b6] be the 2-adic completion of the ring obtained by\nadjoining an 8th root of unity to the ring of integers, and Ff the Lubin-Tate formal\nA-module over A associated to any choice of power series f (x) \u2208 A[[x]] satisfying\n(see \u00a711.2)\nf (x) \u2261 \u03c0x\n\nmod (x2 )\n\nf (x) \u2261 x2\n\nmod (\u03c0),\n\nwith uniformizer \u03c0 = \u03b6 \u2212 1.

Using the map \u03b3 7\u2192 \u03b6 to identify the group of 8th roots of\nunity with C8 gives an action of C8 on Ff extending the canonical action of C2 by\nformal multiplication by \u22121. As described in \u00a711.3.4 below, this data is classify by\na C8 -equivariant map of graded rings\n\u03c0\u2217u M U ((C8 )) \u2192 A\u2217\n\n(11.7)\n\nin which A\u2217 = A[u\u00b11 ], |u| = 2, and in which the action of the chosen generator\n\u03b3 \u2208 C8 is the A-algebra map sending u to \u03b6u. The first thing to check about this\nmap is\nProposition 11.8. The image of D \u2208 \u03c019\u03c1 M U ((C8 )) under\nu\n\u03c019\u03c1 M U ((C8 )) \u2192 \u03c0152\nM U ((C8)) \u2192 A152\n\nis a unit, hence (11.7) factors uniquely through a C8 -equivariant map\n\u03c0\u2217u \u03a9O \u2192 A\u2217 .\n\n(11.9)\nLet\n\n\u03c7 : H 2 (C8 ; \u03c02uj+1 \u03a9O ) \u2192 H 2 (C8 ; A2j+1 )\nbe the map of cohomology groups induced by (11.9).

The argument of this section can be easily adapted to prove a\ndetection theorem for M U ((C2n )) as long as n \u2265 3. The result does not hold in the\ncases n < 3. What fails is the assertion in Proposition 11.13 that the two maps have\nthe same kernel. This assertion makes essential use of the fact that the reduction\nof the Lubin-Tate group over A/(\u03c0) has height greater than 2.\nThe remainder of this section is devoted to filling in the details of this outline.\nWe begin in \u00a711.2 by recalling the Lubin-Tate formal A-module [49] and some simple but useful results relating the power series [a](x) to the \u03c0-adic valuation of a.\nWe turn in \u00a711.3 to the ideas connecting the Adams-Novikov E2 -term to group\ncohomology. In \u00a711.3.4 we describe the \"conjugation action\" and prove Proposition 11.28 which describes the functor co-represented by \u03c0\u2217u M U ((G)) on the category\nof G-equivariant graded commutative rings. Setting all of this up brings us as far\nas the statement of Proposition 11.8 which is proved in \u00a711.4. Proposition 11.13 is\nproved in \u00a711.5. The proof relies heavily on the computations in [63] and [78], in\nthe form of Proposition 11.34. An addendum to this section discusses how these\ncomputations are made, and how they lead to Lemmas 11.11 and Proposition 11.34.\nThe reader may also wish to consult [64] for another presentation of these ideas.\n11.2. Formal A-modules and the Lubin-Tate group. Let A and R be commutative rings, and e : A \u2192 R a ring homomorphism. A (1-dimensional) formal\nA-module over R is a formal group law F over R, equipped with a ring homomorphism\nA \u2192 End(F )\na 7\u2192 [a](x)\n\u2032\n\nwith the property that [a] (0) = e(a). In the case of interest to us, e is a monomorphism (in fact the identity map), and we will not distinguish in notation between\na and e(a).\nFormal A-modules were introduced by Lubin and Tate in their work [49] on local\nclass field theory. For A the ring of integers in a local field with finite residue field,\nthey constructed a formal A-module over A itself, unique up to isomorphism. Their\nconstruction starts with a choice of uniformizer \u03c0 \u2208 A and a power series\nf (x) \u2208 A[[x]]\nintended to be the endomorphism [\u03c0](x). Writing q for the order of the residue\nfield, the power series f is required to satisfy\nf (x) \u2261 \u03c0x\n\nmod (x2 )\n\nf (x) \u2261 xq\n\nmod (\u03c0).\n\nFor example, f (x) could be taken to be \u03c0x + xq . Lubin and Tate showed that such\nan f determines a formal A-module in which the formal sum is the unique power\nseries Ff (x, y) \u2208 A[[x]] satisfying\nFf (x, y) \u2261 x + y\n\nmod (x, y)2\n\nFf (f (x), f (y)) = f (Ff (x, y)),\nand for a \u2208 A the power series [a](x) is the unique power series satisfying\n[a](x) \u2261 ax\n\nmod (x)2\n\n[a](f (x)) = f ([a](x)).\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n107\n\nIn particular, one does indeed have [\u03c0](x) = f (x).\nContinuing with the Lubin-Tate formal A-module, for a \u2208 A write\n[a](x) \u2261 \u03b1d xd + * * *\n\nmod (\u03c0)\n\nwith 0 6= \u03b1d \u2208 A/(\u03c0). One easily checks that the function \u03bd(a) = logq (d) defines\na valuation on A. The the fact that [\u03c0](x) = f (x) implies that \u03bd is the unique\nvaluation for which \u03bd(\u03c0) = 1.\nWe are interested in the case\nA = Z2 [\u03b6],\nwith \u03c0 = \u03b6 \u2212 1, and any fixed choice of f (x). Since \u03bd(\u03b6 \u2212 1) = 1, \u03bd(\u03b6 2 \u2212 1) = 2 and\n\u03bd(\u03b6 4 \u2212 1) = 4, and since any unit in A is congruent to 1 modulo \u03c0, this means that\nmodulo (\u03c0)\n[\u03b6 \u2212 1](x) \u2261 x2 + * * *\n[\u03b6 2 \u2212 1](x) \u2261 x4 + * * *\n[\u03b6 4 \u2212 1](x) \u2261 x16 + * * * ,\nand so\n[\u03b6](x) \u2261 x + x2 + * * *\nFf\n\n\u2261 x + x2 + * * *\n[\u03b6 2 ](x) \u2261 x + x4 + * * *\n(11.15)\n\nFf\n\n\u2261 x + x4 + * * *\n[\u03b6 4 ](x) \u2261 x + x16 + * * *\nFf\n\n\u2261 x + x16 + * * * .\nThese congruences play an important role in the proof of Proposition 11.8.\nRemark 11.16. The formulae (11.15) are independent of the choice of f (x). In\nparticular they hold for a choice of f leading to a 2-typical formal group law.\n11.3. Group actions and homogeneous formal group laws. We now turn to\nthe relationship between group actions on formal group laws and group cohomology.\nOur eventual goal involves some explicit formulas, so we begin with a relatively\ndetailed summary.\nL\n11.3.1. Homogeneous formal group laws. Suppose that R\u2217 =\nRn is a graded\ncommutative ring. By Quillen's work [67, 4] the set of graded ring homomorphisms\nM U\u2217 \u2192 R\u2217\n\nis in one to one correspondence with the set of formal group laws F over R which\nare homogeneous of degree \u22122 in the sense that the formal sum\nF (x, y)\nis homogeneous of degree \u22122, when x and y are given degree \u22122. In terms of the\npower series\nX\nF (x, y) = x + y +\naij xi y j\n\nthis means that aij has degree 2(i + j \u2212 1).\n\n\f108\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nThe graded ring M U\u2217 M U = \u03c0\u2217 M U \u2227 M U co-represents the functor associating\nto a graded ring R\u2217 the set of pairs (F1 , F2 ) of homogeneous formal group laws\nand an isomorphism g : F1 \u2192 F2 between them which is strict in the sense that it\nis given by a power series of the form\n[g](x) = x + O(x2 ).\nMore generally, the ring \u03c0\u2217 M U (n) (n-fold smash product) co-represents functor\nassociating to a graded ring R\u2217 the set of chains\nF1 \u2192 * * * \u2192 Fn\nof homogeneous formal group laws and strict isomorphisms over R. The standard\nconvention is that the homogeneous formal group law Fi is the one classified by the\nmap\n\u03c0\u2217 M U \u2192 \u03c0\u2217 M U \u2227 * * * \u2227 M U\ninduced from the inclusion of the ith factor\nS 0 \u2227 * * * \u2227 M U \u2227 * * * \u2227 S 0 \u2192 M U \u2227 * * * \u2227 M U.\nTaken together, the pair (M U\u2217 , M U\u2217 M U ) forms the Hopf algebroid which corepresents the functor associating to a graded commutative ring R\u2217 the groupoid of\nhomogeneous formal group laws over R\u2217 and strict isomorphisms. For the definition\nof Hopf algebroid, the reader is referred to [71, Definition A1.1.1].\n11.3.2. Group actions. Let MF G be the category of pairs (R, F ), with F a formal\ngroup law over a commutative ring R, and in which a morphism\n(f, \u03c8) : (R1 , F1 ) \u2192 (R2 , F2 )\nconsists of a ring homomorphism f : R1 \u2192 R2 , and an isomorphism of formal group\n\u2248\n\u2192 f \u2217 F1 . Morphisms can also be described as ring homomorphisms\nlaws \u03c8 : F2 \u2212\nh : R1 [[x]] \u2192 R2 [[x]]\nh(r) = f (r)\nh(x) = \u03c8(x)\nwhich are compatible with the formal sum in the sense that the diagram\nR1 [[x]]\n\nh\n\n/ R2 [[x]]\nF2\n\nF1\n\n\u000f\nR1 [[x, y]]\n\nh\n\n\u000f\n/ R2 [[x, y]]\n\ncommutes. Let MhF G be the analogous category of homogeneous formal group laws\nover graded rings, and strict isomorphisms.\nThe categories MF G and MhF G are related by the strictification functor\nMF G \u2192 MhF G\n(R, F ) 7\u2192 (R\u2217 , F h ).\nThe ring R\u2217 = R[u] is obtained from R by adjoining a polynomial variable u with\n|u| = 2, and F h is the unique formal power series satisfying\n(11.17)\n\nu F h (x, y) = F (ux, ux).\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n109\n\nThe strictification of a map (f, \u03c8) : (R, F ) \u2192 (R\u2032 , F \u2032 ) is the pair\n(f h , \u03c8 h ) : (R\u2217 , F h ) \u2192 (R\u2217\u2032 , (F \u2032 )h )\nwith f h (u) = \u03c8 \u2032 (0)u and \u03c8 h (x) the unique power series satisfying u \u03c8 h (x) = \u03c8(ux).\nA (left) action of a group G on a pair (R, F ) \u2208 MF G is a map of monoids\nG \u2192 MF G ((R, F ), (R, F )),\nand a strict (left) action of a group on (R\u2217 , F ) \u2208 MhF G is a map\nG \u2192 MhF G ((R\u2217 , F ), (R\u2217 , F )).\nThe strictification functor converts a group action into a strict one.\nA left action of G on (R, F ) corresponds to a left action of G on R[[x]]. We will\nuse the notation\nr 7\u2192 g r\n\nr\u2208R\n\nx 7\u2192 [g](x)\nfor this action.\nExample 11.18. Suppose that E is a complex oriented, homotopy commutative ring\nspectrum, and that a finite group G acts on E by homotopy multiplicative maps.\nLet F denote the corresponding homogeneous formal group law over \u03c0\u2217 E. Then\nthe action of G on E \u2217 (CP\u221e ) gives a strict action of G on (\u03c0\u2217 E, F ).\nExample 11.19.

For our purposes it is easier to work with the fibers of the\nmap from Tot X \u2022 . Write F X 0 = Tot X \u2022 , and define F X n to be the homotopy fiber\nof the map Tot X \u2022 \u2192 Totn\u22121 X \u2022 .

The conjugation action. Applying the strictification functor to Example 11.19,\none is led to the \"conjugation action\" of C2 on homogeneous formal group laws over\ngraded rings.\nLet F be a homogeneous formal group law over a graded commutative ring R\u2217 ,\nand c : R\u2217 \u2192 R\u2217 any ring homomorphism with the property that c : R2n \u2192 R2n\nthe map given by multiplication by (\u22121)n .

These combine to give an action of C2 on (R\u2217 , F ) which\nwe call the conjugation action associated to c : R\u2217 \u2192 R\u2217 .\nThe map c is completely specified on the even degree elements in R\u2217 and in\ngeneral there are as many conjugation actions as there are ways of extending c to\nall of R\u2217 . In the examples of interest to us, R\u2217 will be evenly graded, and so there\nis exactly one conjugation action.\nExample 11.27. If E is a real-oriented spectrum, then the underlying C2 action\non (i\u22170 E)\u2217 [[CP\u221e ]] is the conjugation action. The case E = M UR is universal in\nthe sense that the map M U\u2217 \u2192 R\u2217 classifying a homogeneous formal group law is\nequivariant for any choice of conjugation action.\nWe now generalize Example 11.27.

Examples 11.18 and 11.27 then equip (\u03c0\u2217u M U ((G)) , F ) with a G-action\nextending the conjugation action of C2 .\nProposition 11.28. The pair (\u03c0\u2217u M U ((G)), F ) equipped with its G-action is universal in the sense that map associating to a G-equivariant\n(11.29)\n\nf : \u03c0\u2217u M U ((G)) \u2192 R\u2217 ,\n\nthe pair (R\u2217, f \u2217 F ) with its induced G-action, is a bijection between the set of equivariant maps (11.29) and the set of (R\u2217 , F ) equipped with a G-action extending the\none on R\u2217 , and the conjugation action of C2 \u2282 G.\nProof: Suppose that (R\u2217 , F ) is a homogeneous formal group law over a graded\nring, equipped with a G-action extending the conjugation action of C2 . Choose a\ngenerator \u03b3 \u2208 G. This data is equivalent to an isomorphism\n\u03c4 : F1 \u2192 F0\nhaving the property that the composite of the chain of isomorphisms\n\u03c4g/2\u22121\n\n\u03c4\n\n\u03c4\n\n0\n1\nF0\nF1 \u2212\u2192\nFg/2 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Fg/2\u22121 \u2212\n\u2192 * * * \u2212\u2192\n\n\u03c4i = (\u03b3 i )\u2217 \u03c4\nis the conjugation isomorphism c. The claim then follows from the decomposition (5.2) and the description of \u03c0\u2217 M U \u2227 * * * \u2227 M U in terms of chains of composable\nstrict isomorphisms.\n\u0003\n11.4. The fundamental representation. As described in \u00a711.1 these ideas can\nbe used to construct a C8 -equivariant ring homomorphism from \u03c0\u2217u \u03a9O to much\nsmaller ring. Let A = Z2 [\u03b6] be as in \u00a711, and Ff the Lubin-Tate formal A-module\nover A associated to a power series series f (x) leading to a 2-typical formal group\nlaw. Using \u03b6 to identify the group of 8th -roots of unity with C8 , we get a C8 action\non (A, Ff ). From this apply the strictification functor to get a strict action of C8\non (A\u2217 , Ffh ). With an eye toward Proposition 11.8, we invert the class u and redefine A\u2217 to be A[u, u\u22121 ]. The underlying C2 -action is the conjugation action, so\nProposition 11.28 provides a C8 -equivariant map\n(11.30)\n\n\u03c0\u2217u M U ((C8 )) \u2192 A\u2217 ,\n\nclassifying (A\u2217 , Ffh ) with its C8 -action.\nProposition 11.31.

Since Ffh is already 2-typical, this is just the coefficient of x2 in the power\nseries [\u03b6]Ffh (x) in the homogeneous formal group law. By (11.15) this coefficient is\n\n\f114\n\nM. A. HILL, M.

Lemma 11.11 and Proposition 11.34 do not quite appear literature in a readily accessible form, and the purpose of this addendum is to outline\ntheir proofs, explaining how the key points can be read off from the results of [63]\nand [78]. To conform with the notation of these references, we will use BP rather\nthat M U in this section.\nThe paper [63] introduced the chromatic approach to studying the groups\nExts,\u2217\nBP\u2217 BP (BP\u2217 , BP\u2217 ).\nThe computation begins with the fact that for s > 0 one has\nExts,\u2217\nBP\u2217 BP (BP\u2217 , BP\u2217 ) \u2297 Q = 0.\nThis means that the connecting homomorphism\nj+1\n\nj+1\n\n2,2\n\u221e\nExt1,2\nBP\u2217 BP (BP\u2217 , BP\u2217 /2 ) \u2192 ExtBP\u2217 BP (BP\u2217 , BP\u2217 )\n\nis an isomorphism. The assertion of Proposition 11.34 is that the map\nj+1\n\nj+1\n\n1,2\n\u221e\nExt1,2\nBP\u2217 BP (BP\u2217 , BP\u2217 /2) \u2192 ExtBP\u2217 BP (BP\u2217 , BP\u2217 /2 )\n\ninduced by the inclusion\n1/2\n\nBP\u2217 /2 \u2212\u2212\u2192 BP\u2217 /2\u221e\nis surjective, and that the left had group is spanned by the elements listed. Continuing with the chromatic approach, one is led to the following diagram (in which,\ns,t\nto manage the size, we have abbreviated Exts,t\nBP\u2217 BP (BP\u2217 , M ) to Ext (M ))\n(11.40)\nj+1\n\nExt0,2\n\n(BP\u2217 /(2, v1\u221e ))\n\u007f_\n\u000f\n\n0,2j+1\n\nExt\n\n(BP\u2217 /(2\u221e , v1\u221e ))\n\n\u03b41\n\n/ Ext1,2j+1 (BP /(2))\n\u2217\n\n/ Ext1,2j+1 (v \u22121 BP /(2))\n\u2217\n1\n\n\u000f\n/ Ext1,2j+1 (BP /(2\u221e ))\n\u2217\n\n\u000f\n/ Ext1,2j+1 (v \u22121 BP /(2\u221e )) .\n\u2217\n1\n\nThe rightmost column is analyzed using the Miller-Ravenel change of rings theorem\n(see [62] or [71, Chapter 6, \u00a71]) which identifies it with the map\n\u00b11\n\u00d7\n\u00b11\n1\n\u221e\nH 1 (Z\u00d7\n2 ; Z(2) [v1 ]/(2)) \u2192 H (Z2 ; Z(2) [v1 ]/(2 ))\n\nin which \u03bb \u2208 Z\u00d7\n2 acts on v1 with eigenvalue \u03bb. This is easily calculated, and\nj+1\n\u22121\none finds that the map is indeed surjective, and that Ext1,2\nBP\u2217 BP (BP\u2217 , v1 BP\u2217 /(2))\nj\u22121\nj\u22122\nhas dimension 2, with basis the image of v12 [t1 ] and v12 [t21 ]. This reduces\nProposition 11.34 to the assertion that the left vertical arrow is surjective (hence\nan isomorphism), and that the upper left group has a basis consisting of the elements\nk\nk\nof the form v2s2 /v12 . For this one first appeals to the invariant prime ideal theorem\n([66, 44], or see [71, Theorem 4.3.2]) for the fact that\nExt0,\u2217\nBP\u2217 BP (BP\u2217 , BP\u2217 /(2, v1 )) = Z/2[v2 ].\n\n\f118\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nIt follows that any invariant element in BP\u2217 BP/(2\u221e , v1\u221e ) has the form\nk\n\nv2s2 + r\nv1l 2i+1\n\n(11.41)\n\nwith r \u2208 (2, v1 ) \u2282 BP\u2217 . We now come to the key point. It turns out that a\nnecessary (but not sufficient) condition that such an element to be invariant is that\nthe indices satisfy the inequality\nl \u2264 2k\u2212i + 2k\u2212i\u22121 .\n\n(11.42)\n\nThis can be extracted from the stronger conditions of [78, Theorem 3.3], in which\nn\nthe symbol xn is an explicitly defined element, congruent to v22 modulo (2, v1 )\ni\nand yi is an explicitly defined element congruent to v12 modulo 2. From (11.42)\nit follows that for an element of the form (11.41) to be invariant and have degree\n2j+1 , the numbers i, j, k, and l must satisfy\n6s2k \u2212 2(2k\u2212i + 2k\u2212i\u22121 ) \u2264 2j+1 \u2264 6s2k .\nExpanding, and dividing both sides by 2k+1 gives\n3s \u2212 2\u2212i \u2212 2\u2212i\u22121 \u2264 2j\u2212k \u2264 3s.\nSince s \u2265 1 and i \u2265 0, one has\n3s \u2212 2\u2212i \u2212 2\u2212i\u22121 \u2265 3s \u2212 3/2 > 1,\nand so k < j. This implies 2j\u2212k is even, and so must equal 3s \u2212 1. This in turn\nmeans that 2\u2212i + 2\u2212i\u22121 > 1, and so i must be 0.\nIt thus follows from the inequality (11.42) that the invariant elements of degree\n2j+1 in BP\u2217 /(2\u221e , v1\u221e ) have the form\nk\n\nv2s2 + r\n.\nk\nv12 2\nThus the left vertical map in (11.40) is surjective. Since\nk\n\nv2s2\nk\nv12 2\nis already invariant, a simple induction shows that the elements stated form a basis.\nAppendix A. The category of equivariant orthogonal spectra\nIn this appendix we recall the definition and some basic properties of the theory\nof equivariant orthogonal spectra. For further details and references the reader is\nreferred to Mandell-May [53] and to Mandell-May-Schwede-Shipley [54].\nOne of the reasons we have chosen to use equivariant orthogonal spectra is that\nit has many convenient category theoretic properties.

A symmetric monoidal category is a category V equipped with a\nfunctor\n\u2297 : V \u00d7 V \u2192 V,\na unit object 1 \u2208 V, a natural associativity isomorphism\naABC : (A \u2297 B) \u2297 C \u2248 A \u2297 (B \u2297 C)\na natural commutativity isomorphism\nsAB : A \u2297 B \u2248 B \u2297 A\nand a unit isomorphism\n\u03b9A : 1 \u2297 A \u2248 A.\nThis data is required to satisfy the associative and commutative coherence axioms,\nas well as the strict symmetry axiom.\nThe two coherence axioms express that all of the ways one might get from one\niterated tensor product to another using the associativity and commutativity transformations coincide. The strict symmetry axiom is that the square of the commutativity transformation is the identity map. See [51], or Borceux [12, \u00a76.1].\nEven though it requires six pieces of data to specify a symmetric monoidal category we will usually indicate one with a triple V = (V0 , \u2297, 1).\nA symmetric monoidal category is closed if for each A, the functor A \u2297 ( \u2212 ) has\na right adjoint ( \u2212 )A , which one can think of as an \"internal hom.\" Note that\nV(1, X A ) \u2248 V(A, X)\nso that one can recover the usual hom from the internal hom.\nA.1.2. Sifted colimits, commutative and associative algebras. In a closed symmetric\nmonoidal category, the monoidal product commutes with colimits in each variable.\nIt follows easily that the iterated monoidal product\nX 7\u2192 X \u2297n\ncommutes with all colimits over indexing categories I for which the diagonal I \u2192 I n\nis final in the sense of [51, \u00a7IX.3]. If I \u2192 I \u00d7 I is final, then for all n \u2265 2, I \u2192 I n\nis also final.\nDefinition A.2. A category I is sifted the diagonal embedding I \u2192 I \u00d7 I is final.\nEquivalently (see [25, 15.2 (c)], or [2, Theorem 2.15]), a small category I is sifted\nif and only if the formation of colimits over I in sets commutes with finite products.\nDefinition A.3. A sifted colimit is a colimit over a sifted category.\nExamples of sifted colimits include reflexive coequalizers and directed colimits.\nIn fact the class of sifted colimits is essentially the smallest class of colimits containing reflexive coequalizers and directed colimits. See, for example [1, 25].\nLet V = (V0 , \u2297, 1) be a closed symmetric monoidal category.\nDefinition A.4. An associative algebra in V is an object A equipped with a multiplication map A \u2297 A \u2192 A which is unital and associative. A commutative algebra\nis an associative algebra for which the multiplication map is commutative.\n\n\f120\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nThe categories of associative and commutative algebras (and algebra maps) in\nV are denoted ass V and comm V, respectively.\nThe following straightforward result holds more generally for algebras over any\noperad. The existence of colimits in the algebra categories is proved by expressing\nany algebra as a reflexive coequalizer of a diagram of free algebras. There is an\neven more general result for algebras over a triple [12, Proposition 4.3.1]\nProposition A.5. Suppose that V is a closed symmetric monoidal category. The\nforgetful functors\nass V \u2192 V\ncomm V \u2192 V\ncreate limits. If V is cocomplete these functors have left adjoints\na\nX 7\u2192 T (X) =\nX \u2297n\nn\u22650\n\nX 7\u2192 Sym(X) =\n\na\n\nX \u2297n /\u03a3n ,\n\nn\u22650\n\nthe categories ass V and comm V are cocomplete, and the \"free\" functors above\ncommute with all sifted colimits.\n\u0003\nA left module over an associative algebra A is an object M equipped with a\nunital and associative left multiplication\nA \u2297 M \u2192 M.\nSimilarly a right module is an object N equipped with a unital, associative right\nmultiplication N \u2297 A \u2192 N . Given a left A-module M and a right A-module N one\ndefines N \u2297 M by the (reflexive) coequalizer\nA\n\nN \u2297 A \u2297 M \u21d2 N \u2297 M \u2192 N \u2297 M.\nA\n\nWhen A is commutative, a left A-module can be regarded as a right A-module by\nthe action\nflip\n\nM \u2297 A \u2212\u2212\u2192 A \u2297 M \u2192 M.\nUsing this, the formation M \u2297 N makes the category of left A-modules into a\nsymmetric monoidal category.\n\nA\n\nA.1.3. Enriched categories. In this section we briefly describe the basic notions of\nenriched categories.. The reader is referred to [40] or [12, Ch. 6] for further details.\nSuppose that V = (V0 , \u2297, 1) is a symmetric monoidal category.\nDefinition A.6. A V-category C consists of a collection ob C called the objects\nof C, for each pair X, Y \u2208 ob C a morphism object C(X, Y ) \u2208 ob V0 , for each X\nan identity morphism 1 \u2192 C(X, X) and for each triple X, Y, Z of objects of C a\ncomposition law\nC(Y, Z) \u2297 C(X, Y ) \u2192 C(X, Z).\nThis data is required to satisfy the evident unit and associativity properties.\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n121\n\nAs is customary, we write X \u2208 C rather than X \u2208 ob C. Most of the notions\nof ordinary category theory carry through in the context of enriched categories,\nonce formulated without reference to \"elements\" of mapping objects. For example\na functor F : C \u2192 D of V-categories consists of a function\nF : ob C \u2192 ob D\nand for each pair of objects X, Y \u2208 C a V-morphism\nF : C(X, Y ) \u2192 D(F X, F Y )\ncompatible with the unit and composition. A natural transformation between two\nfunctors F and G is a function assigning to each X \u2208 C a map TX : 1 \u2192 D(F X, GX)\nwhich for every X, Y makes the diagram\nC(X, Y )\n\n(A.7)\n\nTY \u2297F\n\n/ D(F Y, GY ) \u2297 D(F X, F Y )\n\nG\u2297TX\n\n\u000f\nD(GX, GY ) \u2297 D(F X, GX)\n\n\u000f\n/ D(F X, GY )\n\ncommute.\nThere is an ordinary category C0 underlying the enriched category C. The objects\nof C0 are the objects of C, and one defines\nC0 (X, Y ) = V0 (1, C(X, Y )).\nIf V itself underlies a W-enriched category, then any V-category C has an underlying\nW-category, whose underlying ordinary category is C0 .\nWhen V is a closed symmetric monoidal category, the internal hom defines an\nenrichment of V over itself, with underlying category V0 .\nWhen V is closed, a natural transformation F \u2192 G can be described as a map\nY\n1\u2192\nD(F X, GX)\nX\u2208C\n\nwhich equalizes the two arrows\nY\nY\n(A.8)\nD(F X, GX) \u21d2\nD(F X, GY )C(X,Y ) .\nX\u2208C\n\nX,Y \u2208C\n\ndescribing the two ways of going around (A.7).\nWe will write CatV for the 2-category of V-categories, and denote the category of\nenriched functors C \u2192 D as CatV (C, D)0 . When V is closed and contains products\nindexed by the collection of pairs of objects of C, the category CatV (C, D)0 underlies\nan enriched category CatV (C, D) in which the object of natural transformations from\nF to G is given by the equalizer of (A.8).\nA.2. Equivariant orthogonal spectra.\nA.2.1. Equivariant spaces. Let T be the category of pointed, compactly generated\nweak Hausdorff spaces (in the sense of [59]). The category T is symmetric monoidal\nunder the smash product, with unit S 0 . A topological category is a category enriched\nover (T , \u2227, S 0 ).\n\n\f122\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nRemark A.9. Working with compactly generated weak Hausdorff spaces has many\nbenefits, but it does create some technical issue. Colimits are computed by forming\nthe colimit in topological spaces, replacing the topology by the compactly generated\ntopology, and then forming the universal quotient which is weak Hausdorff. This\nlast step can alter the underlying point set. It does not, however, in the case of\npushouts along closed inclusion. More precisely, given a pushout diagram\nA\n\n/X\n\n\u000f\nB\n\n\u000f\n/Y\n\nof topological spaces in which A \u2192 X is a closed inclusion, if A, X, and B are\ncompactly generated and weak Hausdorff then so is Y . This follows from [59,\nProposition 2.5] and the remark about adjunction spaces immediately preceding\nits statement. Among other things this means that the smash product of two\ncompactly generated weak Hausdorff spaces can be computed as the smash product\nof the underlying compactly generated spaces.\nNow suppose that G is a group. Let (T G , \u2227, S 0 ) be the topological symmetric\nmonoidal category of pointed spaces with a left G-action and spaces of equivariant\nmaps. With this structure T G is a closed symmetric monoidal category, with\ninternal mapping spaces T G (X, Y ) = Y X given by the space of non-equivariant\nmaps, with the conjugation action of G.\nA word about notation. The expression \"category of G-spaces\" can reasonably\nrefer to three objects, depending on what is meant by a map. It can be an ordinary\ncategory, a category enriched over topological spaces, or a category in which the\nhom objects are the G-spaces of non-equivariant maps. As indicated above we will\nuse T G to denote the category enriched over G-spaces, with T G (X, Y ) denoting the\nG-space of non-equivariant maps, and T G for the topological category of G-spaces,\nand spaces of equivariant maps.\nWe will be making use of categories enriched over T G . As in [53], we will refer to\nthem as topological G-categories (or just G-categories for short). Let CatG denote\nthe collection of topological G-categories, and write CatG (C, D) for the enriched\ncategory of functors and left G-spaces of natural transformations. The symbol\nCatG (C, D)G will denote the topological category of functors and spaces of equivariant natural transformations.\nA.2.2. Change of group. Suppose that H \u2282 G is a subgroup. The restriction functor\nTG \u2192TH\nhas continuous left and a right adjoints given by\nY 7\u2192 G+ \u2227 Y\nH\n\nY 7\u2192 T\n\nH\n\n(G+ , Y ).\n\nThese two constructions are basic examples of indexed monoidal products (see\n\u00a7A.3). Because T G is pointed there is a canonical equivariant map\nG+ \u2227 Y \u2192 T H (G+ , Y ).\nH\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n123\n\nA.2.3. The basic indexing categories. For a real orthogonal representation V of G\nlet O(V ) be the orthogonal group of non-equivariant linear isometric maps V \u2192 V .\nThe group G acts on O(V ) by conjugation, and the group of fixed points is the\northogonal group of equivariant maps. Given orthogonal representations V and\nW , we define O(V, W ) to be the Stiefel manifold of linear isometric embeddings\nof V into W , with the conjugation action of G. The G fixed points in O(V, W )\nare the equivariant orthogonal embeddings. The group O(W ) acts transitively on\nO(V, W ) on the left. A choice of embedding V \u2192 W identifies O(V, W ) with the\nhomogeneous space O(W )/O(W \u2212 V ).\nDefinition A.10. The category JG is the topological G-category whose objects\nare finite dimensional real orthogonal representations of G, and with morphism\nG-space JG (V, W ) the Thom complex\nJG (V, W ) = Thom(O(V, W ); W \u2212 V )\nof the \"complementary bundle\" W \u2212 V over O(V, W ).\nWe will denote the topological category underlying JG with the symbol J G .\nThus J G (V, W ) = JG (V, W )G .\nThe G-space JG (V, W ) can be thought of as the topologically indexed wedge\n_\nS W \u2212V .\nV \u2192W\n\nWhen dim W < dim V it reduces to the one point space \u2217. When dim W \u2265 dim V\none can get a convenient description by choosing an orthogonal G-representation U\nwith dim U + dim V = dim W (for example the trivial representation). With this\nchoice one has\nJG (V, W ) \u2248 O(V \u2295 U, W )+ \u2227 S U .\nO(U)\n\nG\n\nThe fixed point space JG (V, W )\n(A.11)\n\nis given by\n\nJG (V, W ) = J (V G , W G ) \u2227 O(V \u22a5 , W \u22a5 )G\n+,\nG\n\nin which V G denotes space of invariant vectors in V , and V \u22a5 its orthogonal complement. The space O(V \u22a5 , W \u22a5 )G in turn decomposes into the product\nY\nO(V\u03b1 , W\u03b1 )\n\u03b1\n\nin which \u03b1 is running through the set of non-trivial irreducible representations of\nG, and V\u03b1 \u2282 V and W\u03b1 \u2282 W indicate the \u03b1-isotypical parts.\nWhen G is the trivial group we will denote the category JG simply by J . For\nany G there is an inclusion J \u2282 JG identifying J with the full subcategory of\nobjects with trivial G-action. There is also a forgetful functor JG \u2192 J which\nrefines in the evident manner to a functor from JG to the G-category of objects\nin J equipped with a G-action. One can easily check that this is an equivalence.\nFor later reference, we single this statement out.\nProposition A.12. The forgetful functor described above gives an equivalence of\nJG with the topological G-category of objects in J equipped with a G-action.\nPassage to fixed points gives an equivalence of J G with the topological category of\nobjects in J equipped with a G-action.\n\u0003\nProposition A.12 plays an important role in establishing one of the basic properties of the norm (Proposition A.59).\n\n\f124\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nA.2.4. Orthogonal spectra.\nDefinition A.13. An orthogonal G-spectrum is a functor\nJG \u2192 T G\nof topological G-categories.\nInformally, an orthogonal spectrum X consists of a collection of spaces {XV },\nand for each V \u2192 W a\nS W \u2212V \u2227 XV \u2192 XW .\nThese maps are required to be compatible with composition in JG , the action of\nG, and to vary continuously in V \u2192 W . More formally, one has equivariant maps\nThom(O(V, W ); S W \u2212V ) \u2227 XV \u2192 XW\ncompatible with composition.\nDefinition A.14. The topological G-category of orthogonal G-spectra is the category\nSG = CatG (JG , T G ).\n \u0304\nThe (topological) category of G-spectra is\nSG = CatG (JG , T G )G .\nWe will use the notation\nS = CatG (J , T )\nto denote the category SG for the case of the trivial group.\n \u0304\nThe (G-)category of orthogonal G-spectra is complete and cocomplete (in the\nsense of enriched categories). Both limits and colimits in SG are computed objectwise:\n(lim X \u03b1 )V = lim XV\u03b1\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\n(lim X \u03b1 )V = lim XV\u03b1 .\n\u2190\u2212\n\u2190\u2212\nCertain orthogonal G-spectra play a fundamental role. For V \u2208 JG let\nS \u2212V : JG \u2192 T G\nbe the functor co-represented by V . By the Yoneda lemma\nSG (S \u2212V , X) = XV .\n \u0304\nFor a pointed G-space A let S \u2212V \u2227 A be the orthogonal G-spectrum with\n\u0001\n\u0001\nS \u2212V \u2227 A W = S \u2212V W \u2227 A.\nAgain, by Yoneda,\n\nSG (S \u2212V \u2227 A, X) = T G (A, XV ).\n \u0304\nIt also follows from the Yoneda lemma that every X is functorially expressed as a\nreflexive coequalizer\n_\n_\n(A.15)\nS \u2212W \u2227 JG (V, W ) \u2227 XV \u21d2\nS \u2212V \u2227 XV \u2192 X.\nV,W\n\nV\n\nWe call this the tautological presentation of X and for ease of typesetting, sometimes\nindicate it as\n(A.16)\n\nX = lim S \u2212V \u2227 XV .\n\u2212\u2192\nV\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n125\n\nA.2.5. Smash product. The symmetric monoidal structures on JG and T G combine\nto give SG a symmetric monoidal structure (the Day convolution), denoted \u2227.

A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\n\u0003\nA.2.6. Variations on the indexing category. There is a lot of flexibility in defining\nSG . In this section we describe a variation which is especially convenient for certain\ncategory theoretical properties, and will be used in our construction of the norm.\nWe learned of the result below from Lars Hesselholt and Mark Hovey. It is due to\nMandell-May ([53, Lemma V.1.5]).\nProposition A.19. Let i : J \u2192 JG be the inclusion of the full subcategory of\ntrivial G-representations. The functors\ni\u2217 : CatG (JG , T G ) \u2192 CatG (J, T G )\nand\ni! : CatG (J, T G ) \u2192 CatG (JG , T G )\ngiven by restriction and left Kan extension along i are inverse equivalences of enriched symmetric monoidal categories.\nIn other words the symmetric monoidal (topological) category SG can simply be\nregarded as the symmetric monoidal (topological) category of objects in S equipped\nwith a G-action.\nThe proof of Proposition A.19 requires a simple technical lemma ([53, Lemma V.1.1]).\nLemma A.20. Suppose that V and W are orthogonal G-representations with\ndim V = dim W . Then for any U\nO(V, U ) \u00d7 O(V ) \u00d7 O(W, V ) \u21d2 O(V, U ) \u00d7 O(W, V ) \u2192 O(W, U )\nis a (reflexive) coequalizer in T G .\nProof: Since the forgetful functor T G \u2192 T preserves colimits and reflects isomorphisms, it suffices to prove the result in T , where it is obvious, since the coequalizer\ndiagram can be split by choosing an orthogonal (non-equivariant) isomorphism of\nV with W .\n\u0003\nProof of Proposition A.19: Since i : J \u2192 JG is fully faithful, the left Kan\nextension i! is fully faithful (see for example, [51, Corollary X.3]). To show that it\nis essentially surjective, let W \u2208 JG be any object, and let V \u2208 J be a vector\nspace of the same dimension as W . Define X by the coequalizer\n(O(W, V ) \u00d7 O(V ))+ \u2227 S \u2212V \u21d2 O(W, V )+ \u2227 S \u2212V \u2192 X.\nSince JG (W, V ) = O(W, V ), i\u2217 X is given by the coequalizer of\n(JG (W, V ) \u00d7 JG (V, V ))+ \u2227 S \u2212V \u21d2 JG (W, V )+ \u2227 S \u2212V \u2192 i\u2217 X.\nThere is thus a natural map\n(A.21)\n\ni\u2217 X \u2192 S \u2212W .\n\nEvaluating at U \u2208 JG and using Lemma A.20 shows that (A.21) is an isomorphism.\nThus S \u2212W is in the image of i\u2217 . It then follows easily that i\u2217 is essentially surjective.\nFinally, the fact that i\u2217 is symmetric monoidal is immediate from the fact that\nleft Kan extensions commute. It follows that i\u2217 is as well, since it is the inverse\nequivalence.\n\u0003\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n127\n\nA.2.7. Equivariant commutative and associative algebras. Using the notions described in \u00a7A.1.2 one can transport many algebraic structures to SG using the\nsymmetric monoidal smash product.\nDefinition A.22. A G-equivariant commutative (associative) algebra is a commutative (associative) algebra with unit in SG .\nThe conventions of \u00a7A.1.2 would dictate that we refer to the topological categories\nof G-equivariant commutative and associative algebras as comm SG and ass SG . To\nease some of the typesetting it will be convenient to employ the slightly abbreviated\nnotation\nCommG = comm SG\nAlgG = ass SG ,\nand to write CommG and AlgG for the corresponding G-equivariant topological\ncategories of not necessarily equivariant algebra maps.\nSince SG is a closed symmetric monoidal category under \u2227, Proposition A.5\nimplies that both CommG and AlgG are complete and cocomplete, and that the\nforgetful functors\nCommG \u2192 SG\nAlgG \u2192 SG\ncreate enriched limits, sifted colimits, and have left adjoints\nSym : SG \u2192 CommG\nT : SG \u2192 AlgG .\nSimilarly, there are categories of left and right modules over an associative algebra A. We will use the symbol MA for the category of left A-modules. As described\nin \u00a7A.1.1, when A is commutative, the category MA inherits a symmetric monoidal\nproduct M \u2227 N defined by the reflexive coequalizer diagram\nA\n\nM \u2227 A \u2227 N \u21d2 M \u2227 N \u2192 M \u2227 N.\nA\n\nA.3. Indexed monoidal products.\nA.3.1. Covering categories and fiberwise constructions. We begin with an example.\nSuppose that (C, \u2297, 1) is a symmetric monoidal category and that I is a finite\nset. Write C I for the I-fold product of copies of C. For notational purposes, and\nsubsequent generalization it will be useful to think of an object of C I as a functor\nX : I \u2192 C, with I regarded as a category with no non-identity morphisms. The\niterated monoidal product\nO\n\u2297I X =\nXi\ni\u2208I\n\ndefines a functor\n\n\u2297I : C I \u2192 C.\nThe functor \u2297I is natural in isomorphisms in I (this is just the symmetry of the\nsymmetric monoidal structure). In this section we make use of the notion of a\ncovering category to exploit this naturality in a systematic way.\nLet Setsiso be the groupoid of sets and isomorphisms. Suppose that J is a\ncategory, and that P : J \u2192 Setsiso is a functor with the property that each P j is\n\n\f128\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nfinite. Then P defines a J-diagram of finite sets, and the iterated monoidal product\ndefines for each j a functor\n(A.23)\n\n\u2297P j : C P j \u2192 C.\n\nThese vary functorially in j. This functoriality is expressed most cleanly using the\nGrothendieck construction [28, \u00a7VI.8] (see also [38, \u00a7B.1], or [50, p. 44] where the\nspecial case in which Cat is replaced with Sets is attributed to Yoneda).\nSuppose that J is a category, and that P : J \u2192 Cat is a functor. The Grothendieck\nconstruction associates to P the category\nZ\nI= P\nof pairs (j, s) with j \u2208 J and s \u2208 P (j). The set of maps from (j, s) to (j \u2032 , s\u2032 ) is\nthe set of pairs (f, h) with f : j \u2192 j \u2032 a map in J, and h : P f (s) \u2192 s\u2032 a map in\nP j \u2032 . By regarding a finite set as a category with no non-identity morphisms the\nGrothendieck construction also applies to functors P : J \u2192 Setsiso .\nA functor p : I \u2192 J arises from the Grothendieck construction of P : J \u2192 Setsiso\nif and only if it is satisfies the following two conditions\n\ni) for every morphism f : i \u2192 j in J, and every a \u2208 I with pa = i, there is a\nunique morphism g with domain a, and with pg = f ;\nii) for every morphism f : i \u2192 j in J, and every b \u2208 I with pb = j, there is a\nunique morphism g with range b, and with pg = f .\nIf p : I \u2192 J satisfies the above conditions, then j 7\u2192 p\u22121 (j) defines a functor\np\u22121 : J \u2192 Setsiso .\nThis structure is analogous to the notion of a covering space, and we name it\naccordingly.\nDefinition A.24. A functor I \u2192 J satisfying properties i) and ii) above is called\na covering category.\nA covering category p : I \u2192 J in which each of the fibers p\u22121 (j) is finite will be\ncalled a finite covering category.\nThe aggregate of the functors (A.23) is a functor\nI\nJ\np\u2297\n\u2217 :C \u2192C\n\ngiven in terms of p by\np\u2297\n\u2217 X(j) =\n\nO\n\nX(i).\n\np(i)=j\n\nWe will have much more to say about this in the next few sections. For now we\nfocus on the general process that led to its construction.\nSuppose we are given a formation of a category depending functorially on a set\nI, or in other words a functor\nC : Setsiso \u2192 Cat.\nGiven a covering category p : I \u2192 J let CI \u2192 J be the category obtained by\napplying the Grothendieck construction to the composite\nC\n\n\u2192 Cat\nJ \u2192 Setsiso \u2212\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n129\n\nin which the first functor is the one classifying I \u2192 J. Let C(p) be the category of\nsections of CI \u2192 J. We will say that C(p) is constructed from C by working fiberwise. For example the category constructed from C(S) = C S by working fiberwise\nis C I . The category constructed from the constant functor C \u2032 (S) = C is C J .\nA natural transformation C \u2192 C \u2032 leads, via the same process, to a functor\nC(p) \u2192 C \u2032 (p) which we will also describe as being constructed by working fiberwise.\nA.3.2. Indexed monoidal products. When (C, \u2297, 1) is a symmetric monoidal category, the diagram category C I can be regarded as a symmetric monoidal category\nusing the objectwise monoidal structure.\nDefinition A.25. Let p : I \u2192 J be a finite covering category and (C, \u2297, 1) a symmetric monoidal category. The indexed monoidal product (along p) is the functor\nI\nJ\np\u2297\n\u2217 :C \u2192C\n\nconstructed fiberwise from the iterated monoidal product.\nFor some purposes the notation X \u2297(I/J) is preferable to p\u2297\n\u2217 X. When J is the\none point G-set this can be further abbreviated to X \u2297I . We use this alternate\nnotation systematically when \u2297 is the smash product \u2227.\nThe properties of iterated monoidal products listed in the following proposition\nare straightforward.\nProposition A.26. The functor \u2297I : C I \u2192 C is symmetric monoidal. If\n\u2297 : C2 \u2192 C\ncommutes with colimits in each variable then so does \u2297I . In this situation \u2297I\ncommutes with sifted colimits.\n\u0003\nApplying Proposition A.26 fiberwise to a finite covering category p : I \u2192 J gives\nI\nJ\nProposition A.27. The indexed monoidal product p\u2297\nis symmetric\n\u2217 : C \u2192 C\nmonoidal. If\n\u2297 : C2 \u2192 C\ncommutes with colimits in each variable then p\u2297\n\u2217 commutes with sifted colimits. \u0003\n\nRemark A.28. Though it plays no role in this paper, it can be useful to observe\nthat the class of colimits preserved by p\u2297\n\u2217 is slightly larger than the class of sifted\ncolimits. For example p\u2297\n\u2217 will commute with objectwise reflexive coequalizers, which\nare diagrams of the form\nX\u21d2Y \u2192Z\nwith the property that for each j \u2208 J there is a map Y j \u2192 Xj completing\nXj \u21d2 Y j\nto a reflexive coequalizer diagram. The maps Y j \u2192 Xj are not required to be\nnatural in j.\nThe following is also straightforward\nProposition A.29. Suppose that p : I \u2192 J and q : J \u2192 K are covering categories.\nThen q \u25e6 p is a covering category, which is finite if p and q are. In that case there\nis a natural isomorphism\n\u2297\nq\u2217\u2297 \u25e6 p\u2297\n\u2217 \u2248 (q \u25e6 p)\u2217 .\n\n\f130\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C.

Let\n \u0303\nI be the \"rigid pullback\" category of pairs (j \u2032 , i) \u2208 J \u0303 \u00d7 I with f (i\u2032 ) = p(j), and in\nwhich a morphism is a pair (g, g \u2032 ) with f (g) = p(g \u2032 ). Then the functor p\u0303 : I \u0303 \u2192 J \u0303\ndefined by (j \u2032 , i) 7\u2192 j \u2032 is a covering category.\nProposition A.31. In the situation described above, if p : I \u2192 J is finite then the\nfollowing commutes up to a natural isomorphism given by the symmetric monoidal\nstructure\n/ C I \u0303\nCI\np\u2297\n\u2217\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n\nCJ\n\nf\u2217\n\np\u0303\u2297\n\u2217\n\n/ C J \u0303 .\n\u0003\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n131\n\nThe categories I and J used in this paper arise from a left action of a group G\non a finite set A. Given such an A, let BA G be the category whose set of objects is\nA and in which a map a \u2192 a\u2032 is an element g \u2208 G with the property that g a = a\u2032 .\nWhen A = pt we will abbreviate BA G to just BG. For any finite map A \u2192 B of\nG-sets, the corresponding functor\nBA G \u2192 BB G\nis a covering category.\nIn the following series of examples we suppose H \u2282 G is a subgroup, take\nA = G/H to be the set of right H-cosets, and write p : A \u2192 pt for the unique\nequivariant map. In this case the inclusion of the identity coset gives an equivalence\nBH \u2192 BA G\nand hence an equivalence of functor categories\nC BA G \u2192 C BH .\nAn inverse is provided by the left Kan extension.\nExample A.32. Suppose C is the category of abelian groups, with \u2295 as the symmetric monoidal structure. Then C BA G is equivalent to the category of left H-modules,\nand the functor p\u2295\n\u2217 is left additive induction. If the symmetric monoidal structure\nis taken to be the tensor product, then p\u2297\n\u2217 is \"norm induction.\"\nExample A.33. Now take (C, \u2297, 1) to be the category (S, \u2227, S 0 ) of orthogonal spectra. From the above and Proposition A.19, the category SBA G is equivalent to the\ncategory of orthogonal H-spectra, and SBG is equivalent to the category of orthogonal G-spectra. In this case p\u2227\n\u2217 defines a multiplicative transfer from orthogonal\nH-spectra to orthogonal G-spectra. This is the norm. It is discussed more fully in\n\u00a7A.4 and \u00a7B.5.\nRemark A.34. When C has all colimits and the tensor unit 1 is the initial object\none may form infinite \"weak\" monoidal products, and the condition that p : I \u2192 J\nbe finite may be dropped.

The results of this section apply, with the obvious modifications, in\nthe setting of enriched categories.\nA.3.3. Distributive laws. Continuing with the same notation, we now assume that\nthe category C comes equipped with two symmetric monoidal structures, \u2297 and \u2295,\nand that \u2297 distributes over \u2295 in the sense that there is a natural isomorphism\nA \u2297 (B \u2295 C) \u2248 (A \u2297 B) \u2295 (A \u2297 C)\ncompatible with all of the symmetries.

If D \u2282 NI0\nis a monoid ideal then the subgroup MD \u2282 A with basis {xf | f \u2208 D} is an ideal.\nThese are the monomial ideals and they can be formed in any monoidal product of\nfree associative algebras in any closed symmetric monoidal category.\nLet (C, \u2297, 1) be a closed symmetric monoidal category. Fix a set I which we\ntemporarily assume to be finite. Given X \u2208 C I let\na\nTX =\nX \u2297n\nn\u22650\n\nbe the free associative algebra generated by X. Write A = p\u2297\n\u2217 T X \u2208 C, where\np : I \u2192 pt is the unique map. Then A is an associative algebra in C. The\nmotivating example above occurs when C is the category of abelian groups and\nX is the constant diagram Xi = Z.\nUsing Proposition A.37, the object A can be expressed as an indexed coproduct\na\nX \u2297f\nA=\nf :I\u2192N0\n\nwhere N0 = {0, 1, 2, . . . } and\n\nX \u2297f =\n\nO\n\nX(i)\u2297f (i) .\n\ni\u2208I\n\nThe set\n\nNI0 = {f : I \u2192 N0 }\nis a commutative monoid under addition of functions.

If D \u2282 D\u2032 then the evident inclusion MD \u2282 MD\u2032 is an inclusion of ideals.\nWhen C is pointed (in the sense that the initial object is isomorphic to the\nterminal object), the map\nA \u2192 A/MD\n\n\f138\n\nM.

The ideal MD \u2282 A is the monomial ideal associated to the\nmonoid ideal D.\nExample A.49. Suppose that dim : NI0 \u2192 N0 is any homomorphism. Given d \u2208 N0\nthe set\n{f | dim f \u2265 d}\nis a monoid ideal. We denote the corresponding monomial ideal Md . The Md form\na decreasing filtration\n* * * \u2282 Md+1 \u2282 Md \u2282 * * * \u2282 M1 \u2282 M0 = A.\nWhen C is pointed, the quotient\nMd /Md+1\nis isomorphic as an A bimodule to\nA/M1 \u2297\n\na\n\nX \u2297f ,\n\ndim f =d\n\nin which A act through its action on the left factor.\nRemark A.50. The quotient module is defined by the pushout square\nMd+1\n\u000f\n\u2217\n\n/ Md\n\u000f\n/ Md /Md+1 .\n\nThe pushout can be calculated in the category of left A-modules, A bimodules, or\njust in C.\nRemark A.51. All of this discussion can be made to be covariant with respect to\ninclusion in I. Suppose that I0 \u2282 I1 is an inclusion of finite sets and X1 : I1 \u2192 C\nis an I1 -diagram. Define X0 : I1 \u2192 C by\n(\nX1 (i) i \u2208 I0\nX0 (i) =\n\u2217\notherwise.\nThere is a natural map X0 \u2192 X1 . Let A0 and A1 be the associative algebras\nconstructed from the Xi as described above. The algebra A0 coincides with the\none constructed directly from the restriction of X0 to I0 . A monoid ideal D1 \u2282 NI01\ndefines ideals MD0 \u2282 A0 and MD1 \u2282 A1 . The monoid ideal D0 is the same as the\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n139\n\none constructed from the intersection of D0 with NI00 , where NI00 is regarded as a\nsubset of NI01 by extension by 0. There is a commutative diagram\n/ MD1\n\nMD0\n\n\u000f\n/ A1 .\n\n\u000f\nA0\n\nUsing this, the construction of monomial ideals can be extended to the case of\ninfinite sets I, by passing to the colimit over the finite subsets. As in the motivating\nexample, when the set I is infinite, the indexing monoid NI0 is the set of finitely\nsupported functions.\nBy working fiberwise, this entire discussion applies to the situation of a (possibly\ninfinite) covering category p : I \u2192 J. Associated to X : I \u2192 C is\nJ\nJ\nA = p\u2297\n\u2217 T X \u2208 ass C = (ass C) .\n\nIn case I/J is infinite, the algebra A is formed fiberwise by passing to the colimit\nfrom the finite monoidal products using the unit map, as described in Remark A.34.\nAs an object of C J , the algebra A decomposes into\na\nA=\nX \u2297f\nf \u2208\u0393\n\nwhere \u0393 is the set of sections of\n\nI/J\n\nN0\nwith\n\nI/J\nN0\n\n\u2192J\n\nformed from the Grothendieck construction applied to\nI\n\nj 7\u2192 N0j\n\n(Ij = p\u22121 (j)).\n\nI/J\n\nThe category N0 is a commutative monoid over J, and associated to any monoid\nI/J\nideal D \u2282 N0 over J, is a monomial ideal MD \u2282 A.\nThe situation of interest in this paper (see \u00a72.4) is when I \u2192 J is of the form\nBK G \u2192 BG\nI/J\n\nassociated to a G-set K, and the unique map K \u2192 pt. In this case N0 is the\nG-set NK\n0 of finitely supported functions K \u2192 N0 . The relative monoid ideals are\njust the G-stable monoid ideals. A simple algebraic example arises in the case of\na polynomial algebra Z[xi ] in which a group G is acting on the set indexing the\nvariables.\nA.4. The norm. We now specialize the discussion of \u00a7A.3 to the case (C, \u2297, 1) =\n(S, \u2227, S 0 ) and define the norm functor.\nBecause of Proposition A.19 we may identify the category of G-equivariant orthogonal spectra as the functor category SBG . If H \u2282 G, then the functor\ni : BH \u2192 BG/H G\nsending the unique object to the coset H/H is an equivalence of categories.

In the category of equivariant orthogonal spectra a version of this\nresult appears in [54, Lemma 15.8] (where the reader is referred to [22, Lemma\nXII.2.3]).\nProof: The main point is to show that the diagonal inclusion\ncyl(A\u2297n \u2192 X \u2297n ) \u2192 cyl(A \u2192 X)\u2297n\n\n(A.67)\n\nis the inclusion of a \u03a3n -equivariant retract.

Though it does\nnot appear explicitly in the literature in this form, it is a minor variation of [48,\nAppendix, Proposition 3.9] and is proved in the same manner.\nLemma A.70. An h-cofibration in SG is an objectwise closed inclusion.\nProof: The assertion reduces immediately to showing that that h-cofibrations in\nthe category of compactly generated weak Hausdorff spaces are closed inclusions.\nFor this latter fact suppose that A \u2282 X is an h-cofibration of compactly generated\nweak Hausdorff spaces. Then the mapping cylinder cyl(A \u2192 X) is an equalizer of\ntwo maps from X \u00d7[0, 1] to itself. Since X \u00d7[0, 1] is weak Hausdorff, it is closed. But\nA \u2282 X is the inverse image of cyl(A \u2192 X) under the inclusion X \u00d7{1} \u2192 X \u00d7[0, 1].\nSee [48, Pages 488-9].\n\u0003\nAppendix B. Homotopy theory of equivariant orthogonal spectra\nWe now turn to the stable homotopy theory of equivariant orthogonal spectra,\nthe basis of which is the notion of stable weak equivalence defined in \u00a72.2.4. Our goal\nG\nis to set up the infrastructure needed for the proofs of properties SpG\n1 -Sp6 , and for\nworking with the formation of indexed wedges, smash products, symmetric powers\nand their compositions. These latter are explicit constructions, and to work with\nthem in homotopy theory means determining, in each case, a full subcategory of SG\non which the construction preserves weak equivalences, and which is homotopically\nwide in the sense that it contains at least one object of each weak equivalence class,\n\n\f144\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nThe standard way of doing this is to complete the set of weak equivalences to a\nQuillen model category structure, in such a way that each of the constructions takes\nweak equivalences between cofibrant objects to weak equivalences. This can be done\nin this case, but a problem arises when composing these operations. For example,\nin all of the standard model structures on SG , the symmetric powers of a cofibrant\nobject are not cofibrant (or at least not known to be). The situation is reminiscent\nof the theory of unbounded operators, in which a domain of definition needs to be\nspecified, and in which one can run into trouble trying to compose operators. It\nmight be possible to find a model structure whose collection of cofibrant objects is\npreserved by all of these constructions. But this is more than is really required.\nThis is a situation where the language of model categories tends to obscure the\nbasic task at hand. What is needed is to determine, for a given functor, a homotopically wide full subcategory on which the functor preserves weak equivalences.\nThis problem depends only on the weak equivalences, and is most naturally considered in the context of homotopical categories. With this in mind we begin our\nwork using homotopical categories, where the entire focus is on weak equivalences\nand derived functors, and put off introducing a model category structure until it is\nreally needed.\nHere is a summary of the contents of this appendix. In \u00a7B.1 we review the theory of homotopical categories. Section B.2 introduces various notions of \"flatness,\"\nwhich depend only on the class of weak equivalences, and play an important role in\ndetermining the homotopical properties of various functors. In \u00a7B.3 we develop a\nconsiderable amount of the stable homotopy theory of SG using only the language\nof homotopical categories. This includes most of the results used in \u00a72.2.5 to verify\nG\nst G\nG\nSpG\nwhich\n1 -Sp5 . Our analysis is facilitated by an approximation \u03c0 S to ho S\nwe study as a homotopical category in its own right. To go further it is helpful to\nhave a model structure around and in \u00a7B.4 we define the positive complete model\nstructure on SG . This is a variation on the positive stable model structure of [53]\nhaving the convenient property that indexed wedges and smash products of cofibrant objects are cofibrant. Sections B.5 and B.6 describe the homotopy properties\nof indexed smash and symmetric powers. Section B.7 contains a proof that the\nforgetful functor comm SG \u2192 SG creates a model structure. The proofs of this\nthat appear in the literature are incomplete, and it does not seem possible to give\na complete proof without first analyzing the homotopy properties of indexed smash\nproducts. Section B.8 contains the important result that the formation of indexed\nsmash products is homotopical on a subcategory of SG containing both the cofibrant objects and the spectra underlying cofibrant commutative rings. This result\nis crucial for making use of the norm functor and is part of the reason that we work\noutside of the framework of model categories. Sections B.10 and B.11 contain results on the geometric fixed point functor and its interaction with the constructions\ndescribed above. Finally, Section B.12 contains a construction of the real bordism\nspectrum M UR on which all of the results of this paper are based.\nB.1. Homotopical categories and model categories. We begin by reviewing\nsome notions from [21].\nDefinition B.1. A homotopical category is a category C equipped with a class of\nmorphisms called weak equivalences which contains all identity maps, and satisfies\nthe two out of six property described below.\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n145\n\nThe two out of six property asserts that in the situation\nu\n\nv\n\nw\n\n\u2022\u2212\n\u2192\u2022\u2212\n\u2192\u2022\u2212\n\u2192\u2022\nif vu and wv are in W then so are u, v, w, and vwu. It implies the \"two out of\nthree\" property (that two of three maps in composition being weak equivalences\nimplies the third is), and that isomorphisms are weak equivalences.\nRemark B.2. If the weak equivalences have the property that a map is a weak\nequivalence if and only if some functor applied to the map becomes an isomorphism,\nthen identity maps are weak equivalences, the two out of six property automatically\nholds, and retracts of weak equivalences are weak equivalences.\nSuppose that C is a homotopical category.\nDefinition B.3. A homotopy functor is a functor F : C \u2192 D with the property\nthat F (w) is an isomorphism whenever w \u2208 W.\nThere is a universal homotopy functor L : C \u2192 ho C called the the localization of\nC with respect to W. It is characterized uniquely up to unique isomorphism by the\nfollowing universal property: for every category D, and every homotopy functor\nF : C \u2192 D there is a unique functor ho C \u2192 D making the diagram\nL\n\n/ ho C\nC\u2748\n\u2748\u2748\n\u2748\u2748\n\u2748\nF \u2748\u2748 \u000f\n!\nD\ncommute. While this characterization may seem stronger than is natural for characterizing an arrow in a 2-category, it simplifies the presentation. The difference\nbetween this and the 2-categorical formulation amounts to the convention that the\nmap C \u2192 ho C be the identity map on objects. The category ho C is the homotopy\ncategory of C. Since the localization functor L is the identity map on objects, it\ntends not to appear in notation.\nTwo issues emerge when working with homotopical categories. One is to find\na description of ho C(X, Y ) and the other is to describe conditions under which a\nfunctor F : C \u2192 D between homotopical categories induces a functor ho F : ho C \u2192\nho D. For the first question the following can be helpful.\nProposition B.4. The transformation C(X, \u2212 ) \u2192 ho C(X, \u2212 ) is the universal\nnatural transformation from C(X, \u2212 ) to a homotopy functor.\nProof: This is one situation where it is clearer to actually make use of the\nnotation L : C \u2192 ho C. Spelled out, the assertion is that if F : C \u2192 Sets is a\nhomotopy functor and C(X, \u2212 ) \u2192 F a natural transformation, then there is a\nunique dotted arrow making the diagram\n(B.5)\n\nC(X, \u2212 )\nL\n\nq\n\nq\n\nq\n\nq\n\n/\nq8 F\n\n\u000f q\nho C(LX, L( \u2212 ))\n\ncommute. Before describing the proof we make an observation about the property\ncharacterizing the functor L : C \u2192 ho C. For homotopy functors F and G on C, this\n\n\f146\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nproperty supplies unique factorizations F = F\u0303 \u25e6 L and G = G\u0303 \u25e6 L. It also implies\nthat composition with L gives a bijection between the set of natural transformations\nG\u0303 \u2192 F\u0303 and G \u2192 F .\nWith this in mind we now turn to the proof of the proposition. By the Yoneda\nLemma, the horizontal arrow in (B.5) is given by an element of F (X). By the\nremark above, the set of natural transformations\nho C(LX, L( \u2212 )) \u2192 F\nis in bijection with the set of natural transformations\nho C(LX, \u2212 ) \u2192 F\u0303\nwhich, again by Yoneda, is in one to one correspondence with the elements of\nF\u0303 (LX) = F (X). The map between these sets corresponding to the two ways of\n\u0003\ngoing around (B.5) is the identity.\nCorollary B.6. Suppose that C is a homotopical category, and that X \u2208 C has\nthe property that C(X, \u2212 ) is a homotopy functor. Then the natural transformation\nC(X, \u2212 ) \u2192 ho C(X, \u2212 ) is a bijection.\nProof: Immediate from Proposition B.4.\n\n\u0003\n\nFor the second question, there is an apparatus of definitions to organize the\nsituation.\nDefinition B.7. A functor between homotopical categories is homotopical if it\nsends weak equivalences to weak equivalences.\nBy the universal property, a homotopical functor F : C \u2192 D induces a functor\nho F : ho C \u2192 ho D. Furthermore, adjoint homotopical functors induce adjoint\nfunctors on the homotopy categories. But there are more general situations under\nwhich such a functor is induced. Suppose that F : C \u2192 D is a functor between\nhomotopical categories and that one can find a subcategory C \u2032 \u2282 C on which F is\nhomotopical (where the weak equivalences in C \u2032 are taken to be those morphisms\nwhich are weak equivalences in C). Then F induces a functor\nho C \u2032 \u2192 ho D.\nIf, in addition, ho C \u2032 \u2192 ho C is an equivalence of categories, then one gets an induced\nfunctor ho C \u2192 ho D by composing with an inverse to this equivalence.\nThe situation becomes more manageable when there is a pair (r, s) consisting\nof a functor r : C \u2192 C with the property that F \u25e6 r is homotopical, and a natural\nweak equivalence s : r \u2192 Id. In that case C \u2032 can be taken to be the full subcategory\ngenerated by the image of r, the induced functor LF : ho C \u2192 ho D can be computed\nas\nLF X = F \u25e6 r(X),\nand because of s, comes equipped with a natural transformation between the two\nways of going around the diagram\nC\n\nF\n\n\u2707\n\u000f \u2707\u2707\u2707\u2707\u2707\nho C\n\nT\n\nLF\n\n/D\n7?\n\u2707\u2707\u2707\u2707\u2707\u2707\n\u000f\n/ ho D .\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n147\n\nTogether with this transformation, LF is characterized by a universal property. It\nis most easily stated if we overload some of the notation by using the symbol F to\ndenote the composite functor\nF\n\nC\u2212\n\u2192 D \u2192 ho D\nand identify functors ho C \u2192 ho D with homotopy functors C \u2192 ho D. With these\nconventions we may regard the transformation T as going from LF to F\nT : LF \u2192 F.\nThe universal property is that if G : C \u2192 ho D is a homotopy functor and S : G \u2192 F\nis a natural transformation, then there is a unique natural transformation G \u2192 LF\nmaking\n/ LF\nG\u2747\n\u2747\u2747\n\u2747\u2747\nT\n\u2747\nS \u2747\u2747 \u000f\n!\nF\ncommute. Put differently, LF is the closest homotopy functor to the left of F .\nThe functor characterized by the above properties is the left derived functor of\nF . It is guaranteed to exist when F is left deformable in the sense that there is a\npair (r, s) as above, and F \u25e6 r is homotopical.\nA common situation arises when the weak equivalences on C refine to a model\ncategory structure, and F takes weak equivalences between cofibrant objects to\nweak equivalences. In that case F is left deformable, and one may take (r, s) to be\na functorial cofibrant replacement.\nThere are evident dual notions of a right deformable functors F and a right\nderived functor RF . For more on the definition of derived functors the reader is\nreferred to [68] for the case of model categories, and to [21, Chapter VII] for the\nmore general case of homotopical categories.\nWhen\nF :C\u21c6D:G\nare adjoint functors between homotopical categories, and F is left deformable and\nG is right deformable, then the derived functors\nLF : ho C \u21c6 ho D : RG\nare adjoint. See [21, Chapter VII, \u00a744].\nIt is common, when there is no confusion likely, to drop the L from LF and\nnot distinguish in notation between a functor and its derived functors. We follow\nthis convention in the main body of the paper, where the emphasis is on homotopy\ntheory.\nB.2. Flat maps. The notion of a flat map and a flat functor was introduced in the\nunpublished manuscript [31] in order to isolate useful classes of maps and objects on\nwhich left derived functors can be computed. Though the original context involved\nmodel categories, the definitions involve only the weak equivalences and belong most\nnaturally to the theory of homotopical categories. The dual notion was coined a\n\"sharp map\" by Charles Rezk, and used for a different purpose in [72].\nDefinition B.8. A functor F : C \u2192 D between categories with weak equivalences\nis flat if it is homotopical and preserves colimits.\n\n\f148\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nTypically the functor F will be a left adjoint, and so will automatically preserve\ncolimits.\nDefinition B.9. Suppose that C is a homotopical category possessing small colimits. A map f : A \u2192 X in C is flat if for every A \u2192 B and every weak equivalence\nB \u2192 B \u2032 , the map\nX \u222a B \u2192 X \u222a B\u2032\nA\n\nA\n\nis a weak equivalence.\nIn other words a morphism f is flat if and only if \"cobase change along f \"\npreserves weak equivalences. Since cobase change is a left adjoint this is equivalent\nto the flatness of the cobase change functor.\nExample B.10. A model category is left proper if and only if every cofibration is\nflat.\nProposition B.11.\n\ni) Finite coproducts of flat maps are flat.\n\nii) Composites of flat maps are flat\niii) Any cobase change of a flat map is flat.\niv) If a retract of a weak equivalence is a weak equivalence then a retract of a flat\nmap is flat.\n\u0003\nProposition B.12.

If the vertical\nmaps are weak equivalences, then so is the map\nX1 \u222a Y1 \u2192 X2 \u222a Y2\nA1\n\nA2\n\nof pushouts.\n\nProof: First suppose that A1 = A2 = A. Then\nX1 \u222a Y1 \u2192 X1 \u222a Y2\nA\n\nA\n\nis a weak equivalence since A \u2192 X1 is flat. The map X1 \u2192 X1 \u222a Y2 is flat, since it\nA\n\n\u266d\n\nis a cobase change of A \u2212\n\u2192 Y2 along A \u2192 X1 . But this implies that\n\u0011\n\u0010\nX1 \u222a Y2 \u2192 X2 \u222a X1 \u222a Y2 = X2 \u222a Y2 .\nA\n\nX1\n\nA\n\nA\n\nis a weak equivalence. Putting these together gives the result in this case.\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n149\n\nFor the general case, consider the following diagram\nX1 o\n\nA1\n\n/ Y1\n\n\u000f\nX1 \u222a A2 o\n\n\u000f\nA2\n\n\u000f\n/ A2 \u222a Y1\n\n\u000f\nX2 o\n\nA2\n\nA1\n\nA1\n\n\u000f\n/ Y2 .\n\nThe flatness of the maps A1 \u2192 X1 and A1 \u2192 Y1 implies that the upper vertical\nmaps (hence all the vertical maps) are weak equivalences, and that the maps in the\nmiddle row are flat. It also implies that\nA1 \u2192 X1 \u222a Y1\nA1\n\nis flat. Since A1 \u2192 A2 is a weak equivalence, this means that\n\u0013\n\u0012\nX1 \u222a Y1 \u2192 A2 \u222a X1 \u222a Y1\nA1\n\nA1\n\nA1\n\nis a weak equivalence. But this is the map from the pushout of the top row to\nthe pushout of the middle row. By the case in which A1 = A2 , the map from\nthe pushout of the middle row to the pushout of the bottom row is a also a weak\nequivalence. This completes the proof.\n\u0003\nRemark B.13. If C has the property that every map can be factored into a flat map\nfollowed by a weak equivalence, then the above result holds with the assumption\nthat only one of the maps in the top row is a weak equivalence. Suppose for instance\nthat it is the map A1 \u2192 X1 , and factor A1 \u2192 Y1 into a flat map A1 \u2192 Y1\u2032 followed\nby a weak equivalence Y1\u2032 \u2192 Y1 Now consider the diagram\nX1 o\n\n\u266d\n\nA1\n\n\u266d\n\n/ Y\u2032\n1\n\u223c\n\nX1 o\n\u223c\n\n\u000f\nX2 o\n\n\u266d\n\n\u000f\n/ Y1\n\nA1\n\u223c\n\n\u000f\nA2\n\n\u223c\n\n\u266d\n\n\u000f\n/ Y2 .\n\nBy Proposition B.12, the map from the pushout of the top row to the pushout of\nthe middle row is a weak equivalence, as is the map from the pushout of the top\nrow to the pushout of the bottom row. The map from the pushout of the middle\nrow to the pushout of the bottom row is then a weak equivalence by the two out\nof three property of weak equivalences.\nRemark B.14. In the category SG equipped with the stable weak equivalences\n(B.3.1), the h-cofibrations will turn out to be flat. The mapping cylinder construction then factors every map into a flat map followed by a weak equivalence,\nso Remark B.13 applies.\n\n\f150\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nNow suppose that (C, \u2297, 1) is a closed symmetric monoidal category, equipped\nwith a class W of weak equivalences, making C into a homotopical category.\nDefinition B.15. An object X \u2208 C is flat if the functor X \u2297 ( \u2212 ) is flat.\nShowing that a symmetric monoidal structure on C induces one on ho C essentially comes down to exhibiting enough flat objects in C. In \u00a7B.3.7 we will show\nthat the cellular objects of SG are flat.\nRemark B.16. Suppose that every object Z \u2208 C admits a weak equivalence equivalence Z\u0303 \u2192 Z from a flat object Z\u0303. If X \u2192 Y is a weak equivalence of flat objects,\nso is X \u2297 Z \u2192 Y \u2297 Z for any Z.

A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nCorollary B.23. The category ho SG is additive, and admits finite products and\narbitrary coproducts. The coproducts are given by wedges and the finite products by\nfinite products.\nProof: Let's begin with the case of coproducts. Let J be a set. The adjoint\nfunctors\n_\n\u0001J\n: SG \u21c6 SG : diag\nare homotopical by Proposition B.22. They therefore induce adjoint functors\n_\n\u0001J\n: ho SG \u21c6 ho SG : diag\n\non the homotopy categories. This shows that arbitrary coproducts exist in ho SG\nand that they may be computed as wedges. A similar argument shows that finite\nproducts exist, are computed as products in SG , and that the map from a finite\ncoproduct to a finite product is an isomorphism. This endows the morphism sets\nin ho SG with the structure of commutative monoids. That they are in fact abelian\ngroups can be seen by checking that for all X, the \"shearing map\" X \u2228X \u2192 X \u00d7 X,\nwith first component the projection to the first summand and second component\nthe coproduct of the identity map with itself, is a weak equivalence.\n\u0003\n\nThe \"indexed\" analogue of Proposition B.22 is also true, and appears as Proposition B.56. It expresses a kind of \"equivariant additivity\" on ho SG .\nB.3.2. Suspension and zero space. The suspension and zero space functors were\ndefined in Definition 2.7. Formation of the suspension spectrum is nearly homotopical.\nProposition B.24. The suspension spectrum functor is homotopical on the subcategory of non-degenerately based G-spaces. The right derived functor R\u03a9\u221e X may\nbe computed as\nR\u03a9\u221e X = ho lim \u03a9Vn XVn\n\u2212\u2192\nwhere {Vn } is any choice of exhausting sequence, and \u03a9Vn ( \u2212 ) is the G-space of\nnon-equivariant maps.\nProof: The assertion about suspension spectra follows from the fact that if\nK \u2192 L is an equivariant weak equivalence of non-degenerately based G-spaces,\nthen so is\nSV \u2227 K \u2192 SV \u2227 L\nfor any representation V . This reduces to the statement that for every H \u2282 G, the\nmap\nH\nH\nS V \u2227 K H \u2192 S V \u2227 LH\nis a weak equivalence, assuming K H \u2192 LH is. But this is a standard fact. The\nfunctor R\u03a9\u221e X = holim \u03a9Vn XVn is clearly homotopical, so what is needed for the\n\u2212\u2192\nsecond assertion is to construct a functorial weak equivalence X \u2192 X \u2032 , in which\nX \u2032 has the property that the map\nR\u03a9\u221e X \u2032 \u2192 \u03a9\u221e X \u2032\nis a weak equivalence. One way to do this is to define X \u2192 X \u2032 by XV \u2192\nholimn \u03a9Vn XV \u2295Vn = XV\u2032 .

The map (B.26) can also be\nexpressed as Id \u2227\u01ebU after rewriting the domain as\nS \u2212V \u2227 S V \u2227 S \u2212U \u2227 S U ,\nwith U = W \u2212 t(V ).

The fourth statement obviously implies the\nthird. That the third statement implies the first two is proved by induction on\n|G|, the assertion being trivial when G is trivial. We may therefore assume that\npart iii) holds, and that part ii) holds for all proper H \u2282 G. Let V0 \u2282 V be the\nsubspace of invariant vectors. Using the long exact sequence (B.38), and working\nby downward induction through an equivariant cell decomposition of S V , one sees\nthat for all k \u2208 Z and all H \u2282 G, our assumptions imply that the map\n\u03c0 st (G/H+ \u2227 S k \u2227 S V0 , X) \u2192 \u03c0 st (G/H+ \u2227 S k \u2227 S V0 , Y )\nis an isomorphism. But in \u03c0 st SG there is an isomorphism S k \u2227 S V0 \u2248 S k+l with\nl = dim V0 , so this implies part ii).\n\u0003\nWe next show that both smashing with S V and smashing with S \u2212V are homotopical functors. Combined with Corollary B.34 this implies that they induce\ninverse equivalences of ho SG .\nProposition B.47. Let V be a representation of G.

A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nProof: Since smashing with S V is the inverse equivalence of smashing with S \u2212V\nit suffices to establish the equivalence of the first two assertions. Now for any X,\nsmashing with S V gives an isomorphism\n\u03c0 st (G/H+ \u2227 S k , S \u2212V \u2227 X) \u2248 \u03c0 st (G/H+ \u2227 S k \u2227 S V , X),\nso the equivalence of the first two assertions is a consequence of Lemma B.46.\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary B.48. Suppose that V is a representation of G. Smashing with S V and\nS \u2212V are inverse equivalences of ho SG .\n\u0003\nWith Proposition B.47 in place, we have the following generalization of Proposition B.44.\nProposition B.49. When X is of the form X = S \u2212V \u2227 K, with K a finite G-CW\ncomplex, the functor \u03c0 st SG (X, \u2212 ) is a homotopy functor, hence\n\u03c0 st SG (X, \u2212 ) \u2192 ho SG (X, \u2212 )\nis an isomorphism.\nProof: By Corollary B.34 there is an isomorphism.\n\u03c0 st SG (S \u2212V \u2227 K, ( \u2212 )) \u2248 \u03c0 st SG (K, S V \u2227 ( \u2212 )).\nBut S V \u2227 ( \u2212 ) is a homotopy functor by Proposition B.47, and \u03c0 st SG (K, ( \u2212 )) is a\n\u0003\nhomotopy functor by Proposition B.44.\nExpanded out, Proposition B.49 gives the formula\nho SG (S \u2212V \u2227 K, Y ) = lim[S W \u2227 K, YV \u2295W ]G\n\u2212\u2192\nW\n\nadvertised in \u00a72.2.4 as (2.19).

If X is of the form S \u2212W \u2227 K, with K a G-CW complex and W\na representation of G, then the functor\n( \u2212 ) \u2227 X : SG \u2192 SG\nis homotopical.\nProof: By Proposition B.17 we may assume K to be finite. In addition, it suffices\nto show that smashing with S \u2212W \u2227 K is homotopical as a functor from \u03c0 st SG to\nitself. Suppose that Y \u2192 Y \u2032 is a weak equivalence. Let L \u2208 SWG be a V -dual of\nK.

Using the first part of the duality isomorphism (B.36), we can\nidentify this map with\n\u03c0 st SG (G/H+ \u2227 S k \u2227 S W \u2227 L, S V \u2227 Y ) \u2192 \u03c0 st SG (G/H+ \u2227 S k \u2227 S W \u2227 L, S V \u2227 Y \u2032 ),\nand finally by Proposition B.44, with\nho SG (G/H+ \u2227 S k \u2227 S W \u2227 L, S V \u2227 Y ) \u2192 ho SG (G/H+ \u2227 S k \u2227 S W \u2227 L, S V \u2227 Y \u2032 ).\nBut this latter map is an isomorphism since S V \u2227Y \u2192 S V \u2227Y \u2032 is a weak equivalence\n(Proposition B.47).\n\u0003\nProposition\nFor any X \u2208 SG , the canonical map\nW\nQ B.52.

The indexed wedge is the left adjoint to U and the indexed\nproduct is the right adjoint. The natural transformation from the indexed wedge\nto the indexed product is easily checked to satisfy the condition of Lemma B.54\nbelow. This reduces us to checking the case in which the J-diagram is constant at\na G-spectrum X. But that case is covered by Proposition B.52.\n\u0003\nWe have used\nLemma B.54. Suppose that U : D \u2192 C is a functor with a left adjoint L and right\nadjoint R, and that L \u2192 R is a natural transformation. If the composition\n(B.55)\n\nId \u2192 U R \u2192 Id\n\nof the adjoint to L \u2192 R with the counit of the adjunction is the identity, then\nL \u2192 R is a retract of LU R \u2192 RU R.\n\n\f160\n\nM.

Specializing Proposition B.56\nto the case J = G/H gives the homotopical properties of the \"change of group\"\nfunctors. The functor i\u2217H : SG \u2192 SH is homotopical by definition, and so induces a\nfunctor on the homotopy categories\ni\u2217H : ho SG \u2192 ho SH .\nTaking J = G/H in Proposition B.56 we see that the left and right adjoints to\ni\u2217H are also homotopical, and that the canonical natural transformation between\nthem is a weak equivalence. They therefore induce left and right adjoints to the\nrestriction map on the homotopy categories, and the canonical map between them\nis an isomorphism. This is the Wirthm\u00fcller isomorphism [84, 5].\nB.3.7. Weak equivalences and the smash product. The smash product is not known\nto preserve weak equivalences, but it does so in good cases.\nDefinition B.57. An equivariant orthogonal spectrum is cellular if it is in the\nsmallest subcategory of SG containing the spectra of the form G+ \u2227 S \u2212V \u2227 S k with\nH\n\nV a representation of H and k \u2265 0 and which is closed under the formation of\narbitrary coproducts, the formation of mapping cones, and the formation of filtered\ncolimits along h-cofibrations.\nThe small object argument shows that every X receives, functorially, a weak\nequivalence X\u0303 \u2192 X from a cellular X\u0303.\nProposition B.58. If K is cellular then K is flat: the functor X 7\u2192 X \u2227 K\npreserves weak equivalences.\nProof: By Corollary B.51 and the fact that the formation of indexed wedges is\nhomotopical (Proposition B.56) the result is true when K = G+ \u2227 S \u2212V \u2227 S k . The\nH\n\nfunctor X \u2227 K is built from\nX \u2227 G+ \u2227 S \u2212V \u2227 S k\nH\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n161\n\nby forming wedges, mapping cones, and filtered colimits along h-cofibrations, all of\n\u0003\nwhich are homotopical by Proposition B.56.\nSince every object is weakly equivalent to a cellular object, and cellular objects\nare flat, Remark B.16 implies\nProposition B.59. Suppose that X \u2192 Y is a weak equivalence of flat spectra.\nThen for any Z, the map X \u2227 Z \u2192 Y \u2227 Z is a weak equivalence.\n\u0003\nG\nLet SG\nfl \u2282 S be the full subcategory of flat objects, considered as a homotopical\ncategory using the stable weak equivalences. Since every object of SG is weakly\nequivalent to an object of SG\nfl , the functor\nG\nho SG\nfl \u2192 ho S\n\n(B.60)\n\nis an equivalence of categories. The above results show\nProposition B.61. The smash product functor\nG\nG\nSG\nfl \u00d7 S \u2192 S\n\nis homotopical.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe equivalence (B.60) and Proposition B.58 are enough to show that the smash\nproduct descends to give ho SG a symmetric monoidal structure, and that the map\nSWG \u2192 ho SG is symmetric monoidal. For a more refined statement, see \u00a7B.4.2.\nB.4. Spectra as a model category.\nB.4.1. The positive complete model structure. Let Acof be the set of maps\n(B.62)\n\nn\u22121\nn\nAcof = {G+ \u2227 S \u2212V \u2227 S+\n\u2192 G+ \u2227 S \u2212V \u2227 D+\n}\nH\n\nH\n\nwith n \u2265 0, H a subgroup of G and V a representation of H containing a non-zero\ninvariant vector. We define the class\nG\nSG\ncof \u2282 S\n\nof positive complete cofibrations to be the smallest collection of maps in SG containing the maps in (B.62) and which is closed under coproducts, cobase change\nalong arbitrary maps, and filtered colimits. A positive complete fibration (or just\nfibration) is a map having the right lifting property with respect to the class of\nmaps in SG\ncof which are stable weak equivalences.\nProposition B.63. The category SG equipped with the stable weak equivalences,\nthe positive complete cofibrations and the positive complete fibrations forms a (cofibrantly generated) Quillen model category.\nWe will call this model structure the positive complete model structure, and when\nwe need to recruit a model structure for some task, this will be the one we use.\nHenceforth the terms \"cofibration,\" \"fibration\" and \"weak equivalence\" will refer\nto \"positive complete cofibration,\" \"positive complete fibration,\" and \"stable weak\nequivalence.\"\nRemark B.64. Since the maps in Acof are mapping cylinders they are h-cofibrations.\nThis implies that the cofibrations in SG are h-cofibrations (cf. [53, Lemma III.2.5])\nand hence flat. The cofibrant objects in SG are cellular hence flat.\n\n\f162\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nThe \"positive\" condition is needed for the study of commutative algebras. On\nthe other hand, it creates some peculiarities in the model structure. For example,\nthe zero sphere S 0 is not cofibrant, nor is S 0 \u2227 K when K is a G-CW complex. The\ncofibrant replacements are given by\nS \u22121 \u2227 S 1 \u2227 K \u2192 S 0 \u2227 K.\nThis means that the adjunction\n\u03a3 \u221e : T G \u21c6 SG : \u03a9 \u221e .\nis not a Quillen adjunction, even though the left adjoint preserves all weak equivalences between non-degenerately based G-spaces, and so barely needs to be derived.\nThe positive complete model structure does not quite appear in the literature.\nIt is closely related to the positive stable model structure of [53].\nThe positive complete model structure is cofibrantly generated. The set Acof is\nthe set of generating cofibrations. The set Bacyclic of generating acyclic cofibrations\nconsists of the analogous maps\n(B.65)\n\nn\u22121\nG+ \u2227 S \u2212V \u2227 I+\n\u2192 G+ \u2227 S \u2212V \u2227 I n\nH\n\nH\n\ntogether with the corner maps formed by smashing\n\u0001\n(B.66)\nG+ \u2227 S \u2212V \u2295W \u2227 S W \u2192 G+ \u2227 S\u0303 \u2212V\nH\n\nH\n\nn\u22121\nn\nwith the maps S+\n\u2192 D+\n.

Any cobase change along a map in Bacyclic is a weak equivalence.\nProof: Since the maps in Bacyclic are flat, it suffices to check that the maps in\nBacyclic are weak equivalences.

But that is a consequence of Proposition B.30 and the two\nout of three property.\n\u0003\nProposition B.71. A map X \u2192 Y is a fibration if and only if it has the right\nlifting property with respect to Bacyclic\nProof: Suppose that A \u2192 B is an acyclic cofibration. Using the small object\nconstruction with the maps in Bacyclic factor it as A \u2192 B\u0303 \u2192 B where A \u2192 B\u0303 is a\nfiltered colimit of maps constructed by iterated cobase change along maps in Bacyclic\nand B\u0303 \u2192 B has the right lifting property with respect to Bacyclic . The map A \u2192 B\u0303\nis a weak equivalence by Propositions B.70 and B.17. It follows that B\u0303 \u2192 B is a\nweak equivalence, and so by Proposition B.69, has the right lifting property with\nrespect to Acof . This means that A \u2192 B is a retract of A \u2192 B\u0303. Since X \u2192 Y has\nthe right lifting property for A \u2192 B\u0303 it also has this property for A \u2192 B.\n\u0003\nThe verification of the model category axioms is now completely straightforward\nand left to the reader.\nLet H \u2282 G be a subgroup.

The functor i\u2217 sends the generating cofibrations to indexed wedges of generating cofibrations, hence cofibrations by\nCorollary B.73. Since it is a left adjoint it therefore sends cofibrations to cofibrations. It also sends the generating acyclic cofibrations to weak equivalences.

When cofibrations\nare flat, the monoid axiom implies the \"weak equivalence\" part of the pushout\nproduct axiom once one knows the \"cofibration\" part. Indeed suppose A1 \u2192 B1 is\nan acyclic cofibration and A2 \u2192 B2 is a cofibration. Then the vertical arrows in\nthe diagram\n/ A1 \u2227 B2\nA1 \u2227 A2\n\u223c\n\n\u223c\n\n\u000f\n\u000f\n/ B1 \u2227 B2\nB1 \u2227 A2\nare weak equivalences by the monoid axiom, and all of the arrows are cofibrations\nby the \"cofibration\" part (Remark B.79). Since cofibrations are flat, the map from\nA1 \u2227 B2 to the pushout is a weak equivalence, and the desired weak equivalence\nassertion then follows from two out of three.\nProofs of Propositions B.76 and B.77: The unit axiom follows from Proposition B.59 since cofibrant objects are cellular, hence flat (Remark B.64). The\npushout product axiom asserts that if f1 : A1 \u2192 B1 and f2 : A2 \u2192 B2 are cofibrations, then the corner map from the pushout of the left and top arrows in\n/ A1 \u2227 B2\n(B.78)\nA1 \u2227 A2\n\u000f\nB1 \u2227 A2\n\n\u000f\n/ B1 \u2227 B2\n\nto the bottom right term is a cofibration, and is acyclic if one of f1 or f2 is. It\nsuffices to check the cofibration condition when f1 , and f2 are in Acof and so of the\nform\n\u0001\nG \u2227 S \u2212V1 \u2227 S k\u22121 \u2192 Dk\nH1\n\u0001\nG \u2227 S \u2212V2 \u2227 S l\u22121 \u2192 Dl .\nH2\n\nBut in that case the corner map is the smash product of G \u2227 S \u2212V1 with G \u2227 S \u2212V2\nH1\n\nH2\n\nwith the pushout product of S k\u22121 \u2192 Dk and S l\u22121 \u2192 Dl . This is an indexed wedge\nof cofibrations hence a cofibration. As remarked above, once Proposition B.77 is\nproved, we are done. Since X \u2192 Y is a cofibration it is an h-cofibration, so it\nsuffices to show that (Y /X) \u2227 Z is weakly contractible if Y /X is. But Y /X is\ncofibrant, hence flat, so the claim follows from Proposition B.59.\n\u0003\nRemark B.79. The special case of the pushout product axiom for \u2217 \u2192 A and \u2217 \u2192 B\nasserts that if A and B are cofibrant, then so is A \u2227 B.\nHovey [34, Theorem 4.3.2] now implies\nCorollary B.80.

Homotopy properties of the norm. The purpose of this section is to\nestablish Proposition B.105 which asserts that indexed smash products have a left\nderived functor which may be computed on cofibrant objects. As will be apparent\nto the reader, they can also be computed on cellular objects. Many of the technical\nresults in this section are also required for our analysis of symmetric powers and of\ncommutative algebras.\nBefore formulating our main results, we generalize the situation slightly.\nB.5.1. Equivariant J-diagrams. Given a non-empty G-set J, consider the category\nSBJ G of functors BJ G \u2192 S. A choice of point t in each G-orbit of J gives an\nequivalence\nY\nSB J G \u2248\nSG t ,\nt\n\nwhere Gt is the stabilizer of t. We give SBJ G the model structure corresponding\nto the product of the positive complete model structures under this equivalence.\nThe model structure is independent of the chosen points in each orbit. We will\nrefer to the model category SBJ G as the model category of equivariant J-diagrams\nof spectra.\nTo be more explicit, a map of J-diagrams X \u2192 Y is a weak equivalence if and\nonly for each j \u2208 J the map Xj \u2192 Y j is a weak equivalence in SGj . The generating\ncofibrations are the maps whose j th component has the form\nm \u22121\n\nGj + \u2227 S \u2212Vj \u2227 S+ j\nHj\n\nm\n\n\u2192 Gj + \u2227 S \u2212Vj \u2227 D+ j\nHj\n\nwith Vj a representation of Hj having a non-zero invariant vector. They can be\nexpressed without reference to points and stabilizers as an indexed wedge\n\u0001\u0001\nn\u22121\n\u2212V\nn\n\u2227 S+\n\u2192 D+\n(B.85)\np\u2228\n\u2217 S\n\nwith p : J \u2032 \u2192 J a finite surjective map of G-sets, and V a G-equivariant orthogonal\nvector bundle over J \u2032 having a nowhere-zero invariant section. The generating\nacyclic cofibrations are the maps of the form\n\u0001\nn\u22121\n\u2212V\nn\np\u2228\n\u2227 I+\n\u2192 I+\n\u2217S\nand those constructed as the corner map formed by smashing\n\u0001\n\u2212V \u2295W\n(B.86)\np\u2228\n\u2227 S W \u2192 S\u0303 \u2212V\n\u2217 S\n\nn\u22121\nn\n\u2192 D+\n.

The map S\u0303 \u2212V \u2192 S V is a homotopy equivalence.\nIf J \u2192 K is a map of finite G-sets, the restriction functor\nSBK G \u2192 SBJ G\nhas both a left and right adjoint, given by the two Kan extensions. All three\nfunctors are homotopical, and the both the restriction functor and its left adjoint\nsend cofibrations to cofibrations. This means that the restriction functor is both a\nleft and right Quillen functor.\n\n\f168\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nLet p : J \u2192 K be an equivariant map of finite G-sets. The indexed smash\nproduct gives a functor\n\u2227J/K\np\u2227\n: SB J G \u2192 SB K G .\n\u2217 = (\u2212)\n\nWhen J \u2192 K is the map G/H \u2192 pt this is the norm. The various homotopical\nproperties of indexed and symmetric smash products we require are most naturally\nexpressed as properties of ( \u2212 )\u2227J/K . Working fiberwise, establishing these reduces\nto the case K = pt. To keep the discussion uncluttered we focus on that case in\nthis section, leaving the extension to the case of more general K to the reader.\nB.5.2. Indexed smash products and cofibrations. Let p : J \u2192 pt be the unique\nequivariant map and write the indexed smash product as ( \u2212 )\u2227J . Note that if V is\nan equivariant orthogonal vector bundle over J then\n\u2032\n\n(S \u2212V )\u2227J = S \u2212V ,\nwhere V \u2032 is the orthogonal G-space of global sections of V .\nLemma B.88. Suppose that A \u2192 B is a generating cofibration in SBJ G . The\nindexed corner map \u2202A B \u2227J \u2192 B \u2227J is an indexed wedge\n_\n\u0001\nS \u2212V \u2227 S(W )+ \u2192 D(W )+\n\u0393\n\nin which \u0393 is a G-set, V and W are equivariant vector bundles over \u0393 and V has\na non-zero invariant section. In particular, \u2202A B \u2227J \u2192 B \u2227J is a cofibration.\n\nProof: This is a straightforward consequence of the distributive law (Theorem A.37) applied to (B.85), and the compatibility of the formation of \u2202A B \u2227J\n\u0003\nwith indexed wedges, as described at the end of \u00a7A.3.4.\nProposition B.89. Suppose that J is a non-empty finite G-set. If X \u2192 Y is a\ncofibration of equivariant J-diagrams, the indexed smash product\nX \u2227J \u2192 Y \u2227J\nis an h-cofibration. It is a cofibration between cofibrant objects in SG if X is cofibrant.\nProof: The assertion that X \u2227J \u2192 Y \u2227J is an h-cofibration is contained in Proposition A.69. For the cofibration assertion we work by induction on |J|, and may\ntherefore assume the result to be known for any non-empty J0 \u2282 J and any H \u2282 G\nstabilizing J0 as a subset. In particular, we may assume that if X is cofibrant, then\nX \u2227J0 is a cofibrant H-spectrum for any non-empty proper J0 \u2282 J and any H \u2282 G\nstabilizing J0 as a subset.\nWe will establish the theorem in the case in which X \u2192 Y arises from a pushout\nsquare of J-diagrams\n/B\nA\n\u000f\n\u000f\n/Y\nX\nin which A \u2192 B is a generating cofibration. We will show in this case that\nX \u2227J \u2192 Y \u2227J is an h-cofibration, and is a cofibration if X is cofibrant. Since the\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n169\n\nformation of indexed smash products commutes with directed colimits and retracts,\nthe proposition then follows from the small object argument.\nGive Y \u2227J the filtration described in \u00a7A.3.4. The successive terms are related by\nthe pushout square\n_\n_\n/\n(B.90)\nX \u2227J0 \u2227 \u2202A B \u2227J1\nX \u2227J0 \u2227 B \u2227J1\nJ=J0 \u2210J1\n|J1 |=n\n\nJ=J0 \u2210J1\n|J1 |=n\n\n\u000f\n/ filn Y \u2227J .\n\n\u000f\nfiln\u22121 Y \u2227J\nBy Lemma B.88, each of the maps\n\u2202A B \u2227J1 \u2192 B \u2227J1\n\nis a cofibration. If X is cofibrant, then X \u2227J0 is either S 0 or cofibrant by induction,\nhence\nX \u2227J0 \u2227 \u2202A B \u2227J1 \u2192 X \u2227J0 \u2227 B \u2227J1\nis a cofibration by the pushout product axiom. Since indexed wedges preserve\ncofibrations, the top row of (B.90) is then a cofibration and hence so is the bottom\nrow.\n\u0003\nTo show that the indexed smash product has a left derived functor we need\nto augment Proposition B.89 and show that what when X \u2192 Y is an acyclic\ncofibration, then X \u2227J \u2192 Y \u2227J is a weak equivalence. This can be proved with\nthe above argument once we know that the indexed corner maps \u2202A B \u2227J \u2192 B \u2227J\nassociated to the generating acyclic cofibrations are weak equivalences. But the\ngenerating acyclic cofibrations contain the maps of the form (B.86) so dealing with\nthem requires understanding something about indexed corner maps of fairly general\ncofibrations. These can be studied as the indexed smash products of maps in a\ndifferent symmetric monoidal category.\nB.5.3. The category of arrows. Let SG\n1 denote the category of maps X = (X0 \u2192 X1 )\nin SG , with morphisms the commutative diagrams. As mentioned in Remark A.42,\nSG\n1 can be made into a closed symmetric monoidal category by defining\n(X1 \u2192 X2 ) \u2227 (Y1 \u2192 Y2 )\nto be the corner map, from the pushout of the top and left arrows in\nX1 \u2227 Y1\n\n/ X2 \u2227 Y1\n\n\u000f\nX1 \u2227 Y2\n\n\u000f\n/ X2 \u2227 Y2\n\nto the bottom right corner. The tensor unit is \u2217 \u2192 S 0 .\nWe give SG\n1 the projective model structure in which a map\n(B.91)\n\n(X1 \u2192 X2 ) \u2192 (Y1 \u2192 Y2 )\n\nis a weak equivalence or fibration if each of Xi \u2192 Yi is, and is a cofibration if both\nX1 \u2192 Y1 and the corner map\n(B.92)\n\nX2 \u222a Y1 \u2192 Y2\nX1\n\n\f170\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nare cofibrations. An object X1 \u2192 X2 is therefore cofibrant if X1 is cofibrant and\nX1 \u2192 X2 is a cofibration.\nThe model structure on SG\n1 is compactly generated. The generating (acyclic)\ncofibrations in SG\nare\nof\ntwo\ntypes.\nType I are the maps\n1\n(K \u2192 K) \u2192 (L \u2192 L)\nand type II are the maps\n(\u2217 \u2192 K) \u2192 (\u2217 \u2192 L)\nwere K \u2192 L is running through the set Acof defined in (B.62) (respectively Bacyclic ).\nProposition B.93. Equipped with the structure just described, SG\n1 is a symmetric\nmonoidal model category satisfying the monoid axiom.\nProof: The proof follows the proof of Propositions B.76 and B.77, and, because\nof the special nature of the generators, essentially reduces to it. It suffices to check\nthe \"cofibration\" assertion on generators. In each of the three cases (type I and\ntype I, type II and type II, and mixed type) the result reduces to the case of SG .\nSince the cofibrations are h-cofibration, the monoid axiom reduces showing that if\n(\u2217 \u2192 \u2217) \u2192 (X1 \u2192 X2 ) is an acyclic cofibration and (Z1 \u2192 Z2 ) is arbitrary, then\nboth the domain and range in the corner map of\n/ X1 \u2227 Z 2\nX1 \u2227 Z 1\n\u000f\nX2 \u2227 Z 1\n\n\u000f\n/ X2 \u2227 Z 2\n\nare weakly contractible. But by the monoid axiom for SG , every term in the diagram\nis weakly contractible. The claim then follows since the left vertical arrow is an\nh-cofibration, hence flat. As pointed out before the statement of Proposition B.76,\nthis implies the \"weak equivalence\" part of the pushout product axiom. The unit\naxiom is also straightforward and left to the reader.\n\u0003\nThe proof of Proposition B.93 is more or less completely formal, and can be\nrewritten to apply to the arrow category of any symmetric monoidal model category.\nThis is done in the recent paper [33] of Hovey.\nB.5.4. Indexed corner maps and cofibrations. Proposition B.93 addresses the homotopy properties of ordinary smash products in SG\n1 . For the indexed smash products\nwe work in the arrow category S1BJ G of maps of equivariant J-diagrams, in the\nprojective model structure. Our aim is to establish Proposition B.96 which gives\ncontrol over the indexed corner maps in SG (Proposition B.97). It is the analogue\nin S1BJ G of Proposition B.89. In preparation, we need to identify the generating\n(acyclic) cofibrations. As mentioned in the previous section, those in SG\n1 are of two\ntypes. Type I are the maps\n(K \u2192 K) \u2192 (L \u2192 L)\nand type II are the maps\n(\u2217 \u2192 K) \u2192 (\u2217 \u2192 L)\nwere K \u2192 L is running through the set Acof defined in (B.62) (respectively Bacyclic ).\nThe generating (acyclic) cofibrations in S1BJ G can be taken to be the equivariant\nJ-diagrams consisting entirely of type I or type II generators.\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n171\n\nRemark B.94. A map (B.91) is an h-cofibration if both X1 \u2192 Y1 and the corner\nmap (B.92) are. Since the cofibrations in SG are h-cofibrations the same is true of\nthe cofibrations in SG\n1.\nLemma B.95. If X \u2192 Y is a generating cofibration in the category of equivariant\nJ-diagrams in SG\n1 , then the indexed corner map\n\u2202X Y \u2227J \u2192 Y \u2227J\nis a cofibration between cofibrant objects in SG\n1.\nProof: First note that for generating cofibrations of type I, the corner map is\n(\u2202K L\u2227J \u2192 \u2202K L\u2227J ) \u2192 (L\u2227J \u2192 L\u2227J )\nand in type II it is\n\n(\u2217 \u2192 \u2202K L\u2227J ) \u2192 (\u2217 \u2192 L\u2227J ).\nThe assertion therefore reduces to Lemma B.88.\n\n\u0003\n\nProposition B.96. Suppose that J is a finite G-set. If\nX \u2192Y\nis a cofibration in\n\nSG\n1\n\nand X is cofibrant, then the indexed smash product\nX \u2227J \u2192 Y \u2227J\n\nis a cofibration between cofibrant objects.\nProof: The proof proceeds exactly as in the case of Proposition B.89. The\nfiltration of \u00a7A.3.4 and induction on |J| reduce the problem to showing that the\nindexed corner map (in S1BJ G )\n\u2202A Y \u2227J \u2192 B \u2227J\nis a cofibration between cofibrant objects, when A \u2192 B is a cofibrant generator.\n\u0003\nThis is the content of Lemma B.95.\nSpecializing, we now have\nProposition B.97. If X \u2192 Y is a cofibration of equivariant J-diagrams and X\nis cofibrant, then the indexed corner map \u2202X Y \u2227J \u2192 Y \u2227J is a cofibration between\ncofibrant objects.\nProof: If X \u2192 Y is a cofibration of cofibrant J-diagrams, then (X \u2192 Y ) is\ncofibrant J-diagram in SG\n1 , and so\n(X \u2192 Y )\u2227J = (\u2202X Y \u2227J \u2192 Y \u2227J )\nis cofibrant by Proposition B.96.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe result below is not used elsewhere in this paper, but is useful in other\ncontexts. Having come this far, we record it here.\nProposition B.98. Suppose that X \u2192 Y \u2192 Z is a sequence of cofibrations of\nequivariant J-diagrams in SG , and that X is cofibrant.

Indexed smash products and acyclic cofibrations. With the indexed corner\nmaps of cofibrations under control we can now turn to the acyclic cofibrations.\nLemma B.99. If X \u2192 Y is a generating acyclic cofibration in SBJ G , then the\nindexed corner map\n\u2202X Y \u2227J \u2192 Y \u2227J\nis an acyclic cofibration of cofibrant objects in SG .\nProof: We know from Proposition B.97 that the indexed corner maps are cofibrations between cofibrant objects, so what remains is the assertion that they are weak\nequivalences. This can be reduced further. Suppose that X \u2192 Y is an acyclic cofibration in SBJ G and we wish to show that the indexed corner map \u2202X Y \u2227J \u2192 Y \u2227J\nis a weak equivalence. Give Y \u2227J the filtration described in \u00a7A.3.4, in which the\nsuccessive terms are related by the pushout square\n_\n_\n/\nX \u2227J0 \u2227 \u2202X Y \u2227J1\nX \u2227J0 \u2227 Y \u2227J1\nJ=J0 \u2210J1\n|J1 |=n\n\n\u000f\nfiln\u22121 Y \u2227J\n\nJ=J0 \u2210J1\n|J1 |=n\n\n\u000f\n/ filn Y \u2227J .\n\nBy Proposition B.97 and the pushout product axiom, the upper arrow is a cofibration, which, by induction on |J|, we may assume to be acyclic when n < |J|. Since\nthe cofibrations are flat, this means that the bottom arrow is an acyclic cofibration when n < |J|. It follows that in this case, the indexed corner map is a weak\nequivalence if and only if the absolute map X \u2227J \u2192 Y \u2227J is.\nWe now turn \u0001to the generating acyclic cofibrations. The generators of the form\nn\u22121\nn\nX \u2227 I+\n\u2192 I+\nare homotopy equivalences, hence so are the absolute maps. The\nother generators are of the form\n\u0001\n\u0001\nn\u22121\n\u2212V \u2295W\n\u2212V\n,\n\u2227 S W \u2192 p\u2228\n(B.100)\nS+\n\u2192 Dn+ \u2227 p\u2228\n\u2217S\n\u2217 S\u0303\nwhere p : J \u2032 \u2192 J is a map of finite G-sets and V and W are equivariant vector\nbundles over J \u2032 . The fact that the norm is multiplicative, together with the monoid\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n173\n\naxiom for SG\n1 , reduces us to considering only the right hand factor in (B.100). The\ndistributive law further reduces us to the case J \u2032 = J. Finally, since the map\nS\u0303 \u2212V \u2192 S V is a homotopy equivalence, we may replace S\u0303 V with S V . Evaluating\nboth sides using Proposition A.59 we see that the assertion amounts to checking\nthat\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nS \u2212V \u2295W \u2227 S W \u2192 S \u2212V\nis a weak equivalence, where V \u2032 and W \u2032 are the G-spaces of global sections. But\n\u0003\nthis is Proposition B.30 (see Remark B.33).\nAs with Lemma B.95, the separate cases of type I and type II generators reduce\nthe result below to Lemma B.99.\nLemma B.101. If X \u2192 Y is a generating acyclic cofibration in the category of\nequivariant J-diagrams in SG\n1 , then the indexed corner map\n\u2202X Y \u2227J \u2192 Y \u2227J\nis an acyclic cofibration of cofibrant objects in SG\n1.\n\n\u0003\n\nProposition B.102. Suppose that J is a finite G-set. The functor\n( \u2212 )\u2227J : S1BJ G \u2192 SG\n1\nsends acyclic cofibrations between cofibrant objects to acyclic cofibration between\ncofibrant objects, and hence weak equivalences between cofibrant objects to weak\nequivalences between cofibrant objects.\nProof: The proof proceeds exactly as in the case of Proposition B.89. That the\nsecond assertion follows from the first is Ken Brown's Lemma (see, for example [34,\nLemma 1.1.12]).\n\u0003\nSpecializing Proposition B.102, we have\nProposition B.103. If X \u2192 Y is an acyclic cofibration in SBJ G and X is cofibrant, then both the indexed corner map \u2202X Y \u2227J \u2192 Y \u2227J and the absolute map\nX \u2227J \u2192 Y \u2227J are acyclic cofibrations between cofibrant objects.\n\u0003\nB.5.6. Homotopy properties of the norm. With all this in hand we can now show\nthat indexed smash products have left derived functors. From Proposition B.89,\nProposition B.103, and Ken Brown's Lemma we have\nProposition B.104. The indexed smash product\n( \u2212 )\u2227J : SBJ G \u2192 SG\ntakes weak equivalences between cofibrant objects to weak equivalences between cofibrant objects.\n\u0003\nThis gives\nProposition B.105. The indexed smash product has a left derived functor\nL\n\n( \u2212 )\u2227J : SBJ G \u2192 ho SG\nwhich may be computed as\nL\n\nX \u2227J = (Xc )\u2227J\nwhere Xc \u2192 X is a cofibrant approximation.\n\n\f174\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nB.6. Symmetric powers. We now turn to the homotopical properties of symmetric smash powers, or just \"symmetric powers\" for short.\nB.6.1. Indexed symmetric powers. The nth symmetric (smash) power of a G-spectrum\nis the orbit spectrum\nSymn (X) = X \u2227n /\u03a3n .\nThe homotopy properties of this functor are fundamental to understanding the\nhomotopy theory of equivariant commutative algebras. For indexed smash products\nof commutative algebras the distributive law leads one to consider indexed smash\nproducts of symmetric powers\n(Symn X)\u2227J .\nThese can be written as\n(B.106)\n\n(Symn X)\u2227J = (X \u2227n /\u03a3n )\u2227J \u2248 X \u2227(n\u00d7J) /\u03a3Jn\n\nwith n = {1, . . . , n}. This last expression is an indexed symmetric power. The\ndefinition and homotopy properties of indexed symmetric powers are the subject of\nthis section.\nBefore turning to the definition, we consider a more basic situation. Suppose\nthat i : G\u0303 \u2192 G is a surjective map of groups with kernel N . Then the functor\ni\u2217 : SG \u2192 SG\u0303 has both a left and a right adjoint. This is most readily understood\nby thinking of G-spectra as objects of S equipped with a G-action. The left adjoint\ni! : SG\u0303 \u2192 SG sends a spectrum Y to the orbit spectrum Y /N equipped with its\nresidual G-action. The expression on the right of (B.106) is a special case of this.\nAs in any diagram category, the orbit spectrum Y /N is computed objectwise: if U is\nan orthogonal vector space then (Y /N )U is the G-space YU /N . For the homotopical\nproperties we need information about the W -space, for a representation W of G.\nIt is given by the formula\n(Y /N )W = O(U, W )+ \u2227 (Y /N )U ,\nO(U)\n\nwhere U is any vector space of the same dimension as W but with trivial G-action.\nInterchanging the colimits, this space can be written as\n(O(U, W )+ \u2227 YU )/N,\nO(U)\n\nwhich, in turn is isomorphic to\nYW /N,\nwhere now W is regarded as a G\u0303 representation through the map G\u0303 \u2192 G.\nWe can now define indexed symmetric powers. Let I be a finite G-set, and\n\u03a3I the group of (not necessarily equivariant) automorphisms of I, with G acting\nby conjugation. Fix a G-stable subgroup \u03a3 \u2282 \u03a3I and regard I as a \u03a3 \u22ca G-set\nthrough the projection map to G. For a \u03a3\u22caG-equivariant I-diagram X the indexed\nsymmetric power is the orbit G-spectrum\nSymI\u03a3 X = X \u2227I /\u03a3.\nWhen the indexing set I has a trivial G-action, \u03a3 is the full symmetry group of I,\nand the equivariant I-diagram is the constant diagram with value X \u2208 SG , then\nthis construction is the usual symmetric power Sym|I| X discussed above. We will\nusually not distinguish in notation between a \u03a3 \u22ca G-spectrum X and the constant\nequivariant I-diagram with value X.\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n175\n\nIf X \u2192 Y is a map of \u03a3 \u22ca G-equivariant I-diagrams, the indexed symmetric\ncorner map is the map of orbit G-spectra\n\u2202X SymI\u03a3 Y \u2192 SymI\u03a3 Y\nobtained by passing to \u03a3 orbits from\n\u2202X Y \u2227I \u2192 Y \u2227I .\nIt can also be regarded as the symmetric power SymI\u03a3 (X \u2192 Y ) of (X \u2192 Y )\nB\nI\nregarded as an object of the arrow category S1 \u03a3\u22caG .\nRemark B.107. Since the orbit spectrum functor is a continuous left adjoint, it\nsends h-cofibrations to h-cofibrations. For example, suppose that X \u2192 Y is a\ncofibration of cofibrant \u03a3 \u22ca G-equivariant I-diagrams. By Proposition B.89 and\nProposition B.97 both the indexed smash product\nX \u2227I \u2192 Y \u2227I\nand the corner map\n\u2202X Y \u2227I \u2192 Y \u2227I\nare cofibrations, and hence h-cofibrations, of \u03a3 \u22ca G-spectra. This means that all\nfour of the maps\nSymI\u03a3 X \u2192 SymI\u03a3 Y\n\u2202X SymI\u03a3 Y \u2192 SymI\u03a3 Y\n(EG \u03a3)+ \u2227 X \u2227I \u2192 (EG \u03a3)+ \u2227 Y \u2227I\n\u03a3\n\n\u03a3\n\n(EG \u03a3)+ \u2227 \u2202X Y \u2227I \u2192 (EG \u03a3)+ \u2227 Y \u2227I\n\u03a3\n\n\u03a3\n\nare h-cofibrations of G-spectra.\nNote that X \u2227I with its \u03a3 \u22ca G-action is a special case of an indexed monoidal\nproduct. This means that the distributive law applies to symmetric powers, and,\ngiven a pushout square\n/B\nA\n\u000f\nX\n\n\u000f\n/Y ,\n\nthere is a filtration of SymI\u03a3 Y whose successive terms are related by passing to\n\u03a3-orbits from the filtration described in \u00a7A.3.4.\nAs described in [53], the homotopy theoretic analysis of indexed symmetric powers requires certain equivariant principal bundles. For the moment, let \u03a3 be any\nfinite group with a G-action.\nDefinition B.108. An equivariant universal \u03a3-space is a \u03a3 \u22ca G-space EG \u03a3 with\nthe property that for each finite \u03a3 \u22ca G-set S, the space of \u03a3 \u22ca G-equivariant maps\nS \u2192 EG \u03a3\nis empty if some element of S is fixed by a non-identity element of \u03a3, and contractible otherwise.\n\n\f176\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nThe defining property characterizes an equivariant universal \u03a3-space up to \u03a3\u22caGequivariant weak homotopy equivalence. The space EG \u03a3 is the total space of the\nuniversal G-equivariant principal \u03a3-bundle. It can be constructed as a \u03a3 \u22ca G-CW\ncomplex, with cells of the form S \u00d7 Dm , where S is a \u03a3-free \u03a3 \u22ca G-set. We will\nalways assume our equivariant universal \u03a3-spaces are \u03a3 \u22ca G-CW complexes, in\nwhich case the characterization is up to equivariant homotopy equivalence.\nThe symmetric powers of a cofibrant spectrum are rarely cofibrant. However\nthey still have very good homotopy theoretic properties. Our main result is the\nfollowing.\nProposition B.109. Suppose that X \u2192 Y is a cofibration between cofibrant \u03a3\u22caGequivariant I-diagrams. In the square of G-spectra\n(EG \u03a3)+ \u2227 \u2202X Y \u2227I\n\n(B.110)\n\n\u03a3\n\n/ (EG \u03a3)+ \u2227 Y \u2227I\n\u03a3\n\n\u223c\n\n\u223c\n\n\u000f\n\u2202X SymI\u03a3 Y\n\n\u000f\n/ SymI Y ,\n\u03a3\n\nevery object is flat, the upper row is a cofibration between cofibrant objects, the\nvertical maps are weak equivalences, and the bottom row is an h-cofibration. The\nhorizontal maps are weak equivalences if X \u2192 Y is.\nRemark B.111. By Proposition B.59 the maps in (B.110) asserted to be weak\nequivalences remain so after smashing with any spectrum Z.\nRemark B.112. The situation that comes up in studying the free commutative\nalgebra functor is that X \u2192 Y is a cofibration of cofibrant G-spectra, regarded as a\n\u03a3I \u22caG-spectrum through the map to G, and then regarded as a constant equivariant\nI-diagram. This map of equivariant I-diagrams is cofibrant by Proposition B.75,\nand so Proposition B.109 applies.\nAlong the way to proving Proposition B.109 we will also show\nProposition B.113. The functors (EG \u03a3)+ \u2227 ( \u2212 )\u2227I and SymI\u03a3 ( \u2212 ) take weak\n\u03a3\n\nequivalences between cofibrant objects to weak equivalences.\nRemark B.114. Proposition B.109 is part the reason for the positive condition in\nthe model structure we have chosen. The result is not true for general cellular\nobjects described in \u00a7B.3.7, though it is true for cellular object built from cells of\nk\nthe form G+ \u2227 S \u2212V \u2227 D+\nwith V non-zero. The condition that V is non-zero is\nH\n\nused in the proof of Proposition B.117.\nWe assertions about the top row in Proposition B.109 are most easily analyzed\nIG\nin the arrow category SB\n.\n1\nLemma B.115.

By working through an equivariant\ncell decomposition of EG \u03a3 and using SM7 for the topological enrichment we reduce\nto showing that if S is a \u03a3-free \u03a3 \u22ca G-set, then the map\nS+ \u2227 X \u2227I \u2192 S+ \u2227 Y \u2227I\n\u03a3\n\n\u03a3\n\nis an acyclic cofibration between cofibrant objects. This is an indexed wedge of\nmaps, indexed by the \u03a3-orbits O \u2282 S. The summand corresponding to O is the\nmap of GO -spectra\nO+ \u2227 X \u2227I \u2192 O+ \u2227 Y \u2227I ,\n\u03a3\n\n\u03a3\n\nwhere GO \u2282 G is the subgroup of G preserving O. Since O is a \u03a3-torsor, this is\njust the map of indexed smash products\n\u2032\n\nX \u2227I \u2192 Y \u2227I\n\n\u2032\n\nwith I \u2032 = O \u00d7 I, and is an acyclic cofibration between cofibrant objects by Proposi\u03a3\n\ntion B.102. The second assertion follows from the first by Ken Brown's Lemma. \u0003\nThe vertical maps in (B.110) require a more detailed analysis.\nDefinition B.116. Suppose that \u03a3 is a group with an action of G, and that X\nis a \u03a3 \u22ca G-spectrum. We will say that X is \u03a3-free as a G-spectrum if for each\northogonal G-representation W the \u03a3-action on XW is free away from the base\npoint.\nProposition B.117. If X is a cofibrant \u03a3 \u22ca G-equivariant I-diagram, and Z is\nany \u03a3 \u22ca G-spectrum then X \u2227I \u2227 Z is a \u03a3-free G-spectrum. The map\n(B.118)\n\n(EG \u03a3)+ \u2227 (X \u2227I \u2227 Z) \u2192 (X \u2227I \u2227 Z)/\u03a3.\n\u03a3\n\nis a weak equivalence in SG .\nRemark B.119. We will mostly be interested in the case in which the \u03a3-action on\nZ is trivial. In that case the equivalence (B.118) takes the form\n\u0001\n\u223c\n\u2192 SymI\u03a3 (X) \u2227 Z\n(EG \u03a3)+ \u2227 X \u2227I \u2227 Z \u2212\n\u03a3\n\nRemark B.120. The proof of Proposition B.117 is nearly identical to that of [53,\nLemma III.8.4]. We go through the details because the statement is slightly more\ngeneral, and in order to correct a minor error in [53]. The statements of [53,\nLemma III.8.4], and the related [53, Lemma IV.4.5] both use E\u03a3i , whereas the\nobject that should really be used is EG \u03a3i . This makes the proofs of [53, Theorem\nIII.8.1] and [55, Theorem 4] on equivariant commutative rings incomplete. The\nactual homotopical analysis of commutative rings is more or less equivalent to the\nhomotopical analysis of the norm. So it would seem that any correct treatment\nneeds to be built on the theory of the norm.\nProof of Proposition B.117: For the first assertion, it suffices to show that if\nA \u2192 B is a generating cofibration,\n/B\nA\n\u000f\nX0\n\n\u000f\n/ X1 ,\n\n\f178\n\nM.

It therefore suffices to show that \u03a3 acts freely\naway from the base point on the upper right term (see Remark A.9). Induction on\n|I| reduces this to m = |I|. In this way the first assertion of the proposition reduces\nto checking the special case\n\u2212V\nk\nX = p\u2228\n\u2227 D+\n,\n\u2217S\n\nwith p : I \u0303 \u2192 I a surjective map of \u03a3 \u22ca G-sets and V an equivariant vector bundle\nk \u2227I\nover I \u0303 having a nowhere vanishing invariant global section.

We are interested in representations W which are pulled back\nfrom the projection map \u03a3 \u22ca G \u2192 G. In the first case there is nothing to prove. In\nthe second case the complement of the base point is homeomorphic to\na\nO(V\u03b3 \u2295 U\u03b3 , W ) \u00d7 (ZU\u03b3 \u2212 {\u2217})\nO(U\u03b3 )\n\n\u03b3\u2208\u0393\n\n(see Remark A.9).

Finally, suppose\nthat there is an element h \u2208 H whose image in \u03a3 \u22ca G is a non-identity of \u03a3. Since\nW is pulled back from a G-representation, this element acts trivially on W . If \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393\nis not fixed by h then no point of O(V\u03b3 \u2295 U\u03b3 , W ) can be fixed by h. If \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 is\nfixed by h, then h acts on V\u03b3 . This action is non-trivial since \u03a3 acts faithfully on\nI. This means that O(V\u03b3 \u2295 U\u03b3 , W ) has no points fixed by h since h acts trivially\non W . Both sides therefore have empty H-fixed points in this case.\n\u0003\nProof of Proposition B.109: The assertion that the upper arrow is a cofibration\nbetween cofibrant objects and a weak equivalence if X \u2192 Y is, is contained in\nLemma B.115.

By Proposition B.117 the two right vertical maps\nare weak equivalences. Since the left horizontal maps are h-cofibrations, hence flat,\nthis implies that the left vertical map is a weak equivalences. Taking Z = S 0 gives\nthe weak equivalence of the vertical arrows in the statement of Proposition B.109.\nLetting Z vary through a weak equivalence and using the fact that cofibrant objects\nare flat gives the flatness assertion. By what we have already proved, when X \u2192\nY is a weak equivalence the vertical and top arrows in the left square are weak\nequivalences, hence so is the bottom left map.

The proof depends on our analysis of\nsymmetric powers, which, as mentioned in Remark B.120, makes essential use of\nthe norm.\nProposition B.130. The forgetful functor\nCommG \u2192 SG\ncreates a topological model category structure on CommG in which the fibrations\nand weak equivalences in CommG are the maps that are fibrations and weak equivalences in SG .\nProof: Most of the proof is formal.

Except for the slight change of model structure, it is [53, Theorem\nIII.7.6].\nProposition B.137. The forgetful functor\nM R \u2192 SG\ncreates a model structure on the category MR in which the fibrations and weak\nequivalences are the maps which become fibrations and weak equivalences in SG .\nWhen R is commutative, the operation (B.136) satisfies the pushout product and\nmonoid axioms making MR into a symmetric monoidal model category.\n\u0003\nThough not explicitly stated, the following formal result was surely known to\nthe authors of [76] (see the proof of [76, Theorem 4.3].)\nCorollary B.138.

If S is cofibrant\nas a left R-module, then the restriction functor is also a left Quillen functor.\nProof: Proposition B.137 implies that the restriction functor preserves fibrations\nand acyclic fibrations. This gives the first assertion. The second follows from\nthe fact that the restriction functor preserves colimits, and the consequence of\nProposition B.137 that the generating (acyclic) cofibrations for MS are formed as\nthe smash product of S with the generating (acyclic) cofibrations for SG .\n\u0003\nThe following result is [53, Proposition III.7.7].

In that case the result would not require any hypothesis on M .\nProof: We must show that the map from the mapping cone of\nM \u2227 N \u2192 M \u2227 N\u2032\n\n(B.141)\n\nR\n\nR\n\n\u2032\n\nto M \u2227 (N /N ) is a weak equivalence. The mapping cone of (B.141) is isomorphic\nR\nto\nM \u2227 (N \u2032 \u222a CN ),\nR\n\nand the spectrum underlying the R-module mapping cone N \u2032 \u222a N is the mapping\ncone formed in spectra. Since N \u2192 N \u2032 is an h-cofibration, the map N \u2032 \u222a CN \u2192\nN \u2032 /N is a weak equivalence (Proposition B.20). The result now follows from Proposition B.139.\n\u0003\nCorollary B.140 can be used to show that many constructions derived from the\nformation of monomial ideals have good homotopy theoretic properties. It is used\nin \u00a72.4.3 and in \u00a76.1. In those cases the map of spectra underlying N \u2192 N \u2032 is the\ninclusion of a wedge summand, and so obviously an h-cofibration.\nB.8. Indexed smash products of commutative rings.\nB.8.1. Description of the problem. Proposition B.105 asserts that the indexed smash\nproduct functor\n( \u2212 )\u2227J : SBJ G \u2192 SG\nhas a left derived functor\nL\n\n( \u2212 )\u2227J : ho SBJ G \u2192 ho SG\nwhich can be computed by applying the norm to a cofibrant approximation. We\nalso know from Corollary B.134 (and the fact that coproducts of weak equivalences\nare weak equivalences) that the restriction functor and its left adjoint form a Quillen\npair\np! : comm SBJ G \u21c6 comm SG : p\u2217 .\nFurthermore, the following diagram commutes in which the vertical functors are\nthe forgetful functors (Corollary A.56)\ncomm SBJ G\n\np!\n\n/ comm SG\n\n\u000f\nSB J G\n( \u2212 )\u2227J\n\n\u000f\n/ SG .\n\nHowever, what we really want is the commutativity of the following diagram\nho comm SBJ G\n\u000f\nho SBJ G\n\nLp!\n\nL\n\n( \u2212 )\u2227J\n\n/ ho comm SG\n\u000f\n/ ho SG\n\n\f188\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nin which the vertical maps are the forgetful functors (which are homotopical, so\ndon't need to be derived), and the horizontal arrows are the left derived functors\nindicated. The point of this section is to establish this.\nTo clarify the issue, suppose that R \u2208 comm SBJ G is a cofibrant J-diagram of\ncommutative rings. Let R\u0303 \u2192 R be a cofibrant approximation of the underlying\nJ-diagram of spectra. What needs to be checked is that the map\n(B.142)\n\n(R\u0303)\u2227J \u2192 (R)\u2227J\n\nis a weak equivalence. The proof involves an elaboration of the notion of flatness.\nTo motivate it we describe a bit of the argument.\nThe main point in the proof is to investigate the situation of a pushout diagram\nof equivariant J-diagrams of commutative rings\nSym A\n\n/ Sym B\n\n\u000f\nR1\n\n\u000f\n/ R2\n\nin which the top row is constructed by applying the symmetric algebra functor Sym\nto a generating cofibration A \u2192 B, and in which one knows that the map (B.142)\nis a weak equivalence for R = R1 . One would like to conclude that (B.142) is a\nweak equivalence for R = R2 .\nTo pass from R1 to R2 we use the R1 -module filtration described after the\nstatement of Lemma B.132, whose stages fit into a pushout square\n(B.143)\n\nR1 \u2227 \u2202A Symm B\n\u000f\nfilm\u22121 R2\n\n/ R1 \u2227 Symm B\n\u000f\n/ film R2 ,\n\nwhere\n\u2202A Symm B = (\u2202A B \u2227m ) /\u03a3m .\nThe filtration of \u00a7A.3.4 mediates between (film\u22121 R2 )\u2227J and (film R2 )\u2227J by another\nsequence of pushout squares. The upper right hand corner of a typical stage is an\nindexed wedge of terms of the form\n(B.144)\n\n(film\u22121 R2 )\u2227J0 \u2227 (R1 \u2227 Symm B)\u2227J1 ,\n\nindexed by the set-theoretic decompositions J = J0 \u2210 J1 .\nWe need to know two things about this expression. One is that the left derived\nfunctor of its formation (in all variables) is computed in terms of the expression\nitself, and the other is that formation of each of the pushout squares we encounter\nis homotopical. Motivated by this we are led to consider a technical condition\nslightly stronger than the requirement that (B.142) be a weak equivalence. That is\nthe subject of the next section.\nB.8.2. Very flat diagrams. As in \u00a7B.6.2, to make the diagrams more readable we\nwill use the notation\nX \u2227(K/L) = q\u2217\u2227 X\nfor the indexed smash product along a map q : K \u2192 L of finite G-sets.\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n189\n\nDefinition B.145. An equivariant J-diagram X very flat if it has the following\nproperty: for every cofibrant approximation X\u0303 \u2192 X, every diagram of finite G-sets\np\n\nq\n\nJ\u2190\n\u2212K\u2212\n\u2192 L,\nand every weak equivalence of equivariant L-diagrams Z\u0303 \u2192 Z, the map\n(p\u2217 X\u0303)\u2227(K/L) \u2227 Z\u0303 \u2192 (p\u2217 X)\u2227(K/L) \u2227 Z\n\n(B.146)\nis a weak equivalence.\n\nOur main goal is to establish the following result.\nProposition B.147. If R \u2208 SBJ G is cofibrant commutative ring, then the equivariant J-diagram of spectra underlying R is very flat.\nThe condition that R be very flat certainly implies that (B.142) is a weak equivalence. Proposition B.147 therefore implies\nCorollary B.148. The following diagram of left derived functors commutes up to\nnatural isomorphism\nho comm SBJ G\n\u000f\nho SBJ G\n\nLp!\n\nL\n\n/ ho comm SG\n\u000f\n/ ho SG .\n\n( \u2212 )\u2227J\n\n\u0003\nRemark B.149. Since identity maps are weak equivalences, the condition of being\nvery flat implies that every arrow in the diagram\n(p\u2217 X\u0303)\u2227(K/L) \u2227 Z\u0303\n\n/ (p\u2217 X\u0303)\u2227(K/L) \u2227 Z\n\n\u000f\n(p\u2217 X)\u2227(K/L) \u2227 Z\u0303\n\n\u000f\n/ (p\u2217 X)\u2227(K/L) \u2227 Z\n\nis a weak equivalence. In particular it implies that (p\u2217 X)\u2227(K/L) is flat.\nRemark B.150. Since X\u0303 \u2227(K/L) is cofibrant (Proposition B.89), and cofibrant objects\nare flat (Proposition B.58), the top arrow in the above diagram is always a weak\nequivalence. It therefore suffices to check the very flat condition when Z\u0303 \u2192 Z is\nthe identity map.\nRemark B.151. If (B.146) is a weak equivalence for one cofibrant approximation it\nis a weak equivalence for any cofibrant approximation. It therefore suffices to check\nthe \"very flat\" condition for a single cofibrant approximation X\u0303 \u2192 X.\nLemma B.152. Arbitrary wedges of very flat spectra are very flat. Smash products\nof very flat spectra are very flat. Filtered colimits of very flat G-diagrams along hcofibrations are very flat.\nProof: The first assertion follows easily from the distributive law, and the fact\nthat the formation of indexed wedges is homotopical. The second follows from the\n\n\f190\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nfact that the formation of indexed smash products is symmetric monoidal. The\n\u0003\nthird makes use of Proposition A.69. The details are left to the reader.\nExample B.153. Here is one motivation for the definition of \"very flat.\" Suppose\nwe are given a pushout square of equivariant J-diagrams\nA\n\n/B\n\n\u000f\nX\n\n\u000f\n/Y\n\nand we are interested in the filtration of Y \u2227(K/L) described in \u00a7A.3.4, whose stages\nare related by pushout squares\n_\n_\n/\nX \u2227K0 \u2227 B \u2227K1\nX \u2227K0 \u2227 \u2202A B \u2227K1\n(B.154)\n(l,K1 )\u2208Gn\n\n(l,K1 )\u2208Gn\n\n\u000f\n/ filn Y \u2227K/L ,\n\n\u000f\nfiln\u22121 Y \u2227K/L\n\nwhere Gn = Gn (K/L) is the G-set of pairs (l, K1 ) with l \u2208 L and K1 \u2282 q \u22121 (l) a\nsubset of cardinality n, and the map Gn \u2192 L sends (l, K1 ) to l. For (l, K1 ) \u2208 Gn\nwe have written K0 to denote the complement of K1 in q \u22121 (l).\nThe condition that B be very flat gives some control over the upper right term.\nTo see this let Vn = Vn (K/L) be the set of triples (l, K1 , k) with (l, K1 ) \u2208 Gn and\nk \u2208 K1 . We define maps\nf\n\ng\n\n\u2192 Gn\nJ\u2190\n\u2212 Vn \u2212\nby\nf (l, K1 , k) = q(k)\ng(l, K1 , k) = (l, K1 ).\nThe spectra X \u2227K0 form an equivariant Gn -diagram, which we denote Z. The B \u2227K1\nare the constituents of (f \u2217 B)\u2227(Vn /Gn ) , and so the indexed wedge occurring in the\npushout square is\n_\nZ \u2227 (f \u2217 B)\u2227(Vn /Gn ) .\nGn\n\nSince the formation of indexed wedges is homotopical, its homotopy properties come\ndown to understanding the homotopy properties of the equivariant Gn -diagram\nZ \u2227 f \u2217 B \u2227(Vn /Gn ) , some of which are specified by the condition that B be very flat.\nBy replacing the category of equivariant J-diagrams with its arrow category,\nwe arrive at the notion of a very flat object of S1BJ G . The formal properties of\nbeing very flat persist in this context, and in particular the analogues of Remarks B.149, B.150, B.151 and Lemma B.152 hold.\nTo get a feel for the more particular aspects of very flat arrows, suppose that\n(A \u2192 B) is an object of S1BJ G , and (\u00c3 \u2192 B\u0303) is a cofibrant approximation. Consider\na weak equivalence of the form\n(X\u0303 \u2192 \u2217) \u2192 (X \u2192 \u2217).\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n191\n\nIn this case the very flat condition becomes that\n(p\u2217 (B\u0303/\u00c3)\u2227(K/L) \u2227 X\u0303 \u2192 \u2217) \u2192 (p\u2217 (B/A)\u2227(K/L) \u2227 X \u2192 \u2217)\nis a weak equivalence. This is so if and only if B/A is very flat.\nNext consider a weak equivalence of the form\n(\u2217 \u2192 X\u0303) \u2192 (\u2217 \u2192 X).\nThe very flat condition in this case is that\n(\u2202p\u2217 \u00c3 p\u2217 B\u0303 \u2227(K/L) \u2227 X\u0303 \u2192 p\u2217 B\u0303 \u2227(K/L) \u2227 X\u0303)\n\u2192 (\u2202p\u2217 A p\u2217 B \u2227(K/L) \u2227 X \u2192 p\u2217 B \u2227(K/L) \u2227 X)\nis a weak equivalence. This holds if and only if B is very flat and (A \u2192 B) satisfies\nthe condition that\n(B.155)\n\n\u2202p\u2217 \u00c3 p\u2217 B\u0303 \u2227(K/L) \u2227 X\u0303 \u2192 \u2202p\u2217 A p\u2217 B \u2227(K/L) \u2227 X\n\nis a weak equivalence. If we happen to know that the indexed corner maps\n\u2202p\u2217 \u00c3 p\u2217 B\u0303 \u2227(K/L) \u2192 B\u0303 \u2227(K/L)\nand\n\u2202p\u2217 A p\u2217 B \u2227(K/L) \u2192 B \u2227(K/L)\nare h-cofibrations then the leftmost horizontal maps in\n\u2202p\u2217 \u00c3 p\u2217 B\u0303 \u2227(K/L) \u2227 X\u0303\n\n/ p\u2217 B\u0303 \u2227(K/L) \u2227 X\u0303\n\n/ p\u2217 (B\u0303/\u00c3)\u2227(K/L) \u2227 X\u0303\n\n\u000f\n\u2202p\u2217 A p\u2217 B \u2227(K/L) \u2227 X\n\n\u000f\n/ p\u2217 B \u2227(K/L) \u2227 X\n\n\u000f\n/ p\u2217 (B/A)\u2227(K/L) \u2227 X\n\nare h-cofibrations, hence flat. Thus the middle and left vertical arrows are weak\nequivalences if and only if the middle and right vertical arrows are, or in other words\nif and only if both B and B/A are very flat. So in the presence of the condition\nabove, a necessary condition that (A \u2192 B) be a very flat arrow is that B and B/A\nare very flat. This turns out to be sufficient. We single out the condition.\np\n\nq\n\nCondition B.156.

The map\nof pushouts is therefore a weak equivalence since h-cofibrations are flat.\n\u0003\nB.8.3. Proof of Proposition B.147. Since the class of very flat G-diagrams is closed\nunder the formation of filtered colimits along h-cofibrations (Lemma B.152), it\nsuffices to show that if A \u2192 B is a generating cofibration in SBJ G ,\nSym A\n\n/ Sym B\n\n\u000f\nX\n\n\u000f\n/Y\n\nis a pushout square of commutative J-algebras, and X is very flat, then Y is very\nflat.

This places us in the situation of\nLemma B.164 which completes the inductive step.\nB.9. The slice tower, symmetric powers and the norm. The main goal of\nthis section is to show that if R is an equivariant commutative ring in SG\n\u22650 , and\nn \u2265 0 is an integer, then the slice section P n R is also an equivariant commutative\nring in SG\n\u22650 . The proof makes use of the technology used to show that cofibrant\ncommutative rings are very flat, and so has been deferred to this appendix. The\nreader may wish to look through the first three subsections of \u00a74 for the basic\ndefinitions concerning the slice tower.\nOur presentation of the slice tower was made in a context where the emphasis was\non homotopy theory, and the slice sections P n , etc were characterized by homotopy\ntheoretic properties. Here we will be making use of some explicit constructions, and\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n195\n\nsome care needs to be taken to ensure that the derived functors we are ultimately\ninterested in can be computed on the objects that arise. Using the fact that indexed\nsmash products of cofibrant objects are cofibrant, and that indexed symmetric\npowers of cofibrant spectra are flat, one can check that this is indeed the case. We\nwill take as the definition of P n the colimit of the inductive construction described\nin \u00a74.2, using the cofibrant approximations S \u22121 \u2227 S 1 \u2227 G+ \u2227 S k\u03c1H and S \u22121 \u2227\nH\n\nS 1 \u2227 G+ \u2227 S k\u03c1H \u22121 for the slice cells. This particular choice of P n is homotopical,\nH\n\nand the natural map X \u2192 P n X is a cofibration. Our task will be to show that\nsomething functorially weakly equivalent to P n takes commutative rings in SG\n\u22650 to\nG\ncommutative rings in S\u22650 .\nWe begin with the interaction of the slice filtration with the formation of indexed\nsmash products. As in \u00a7B.5 we fix a finite G-set and work with the homotopy theory\nof equivariant J-diagrams. We define slice cells and the slice filtration in the evident\nmanner, so that the slice filtration on equivariant J-diagrams corresponds to the\nproduct of slice filtrations on Gt -spectra under the equivalence\nY\nSB J G \u2248\nSG t ,\nt\n\nThe proposition below follows easily from Proposition 4.13.\nProposition B.169.

Suppose that J is a non-empty G-set, X is a cofibrant equivariant J-diagram, and n \u2265 0 is an integer. If each Xj is slice (n \u2212 1) positive,\nthen the indexed smash product\n^\nXj\nj\u2208J\n\nis slice (n \u2212 1) positive.\nProof: By induction on |G| we may suppose that i\u2217H X \u2227J is slice (n \u2212 1)-positive\nfor any proper subgroup H \u2282 G. This implies that T \u2227 X \u2227J \u2265 n if T is any G-CW\ncomplex built entirely from induced G-cells. Since the formation of indexed smash\nproducts commutes with filtered colimits, it suffices by Proposition 4.15 to consider\na cofibration A \u2192 B of equivariant J-diagrams in which B/A is a wedge of slice\ncells of dimension greater than n, and show that\n(B.172)\n\nA\u2227J \u2265 n =\u21d2 B \u2227J \u2265 n.\n\n\f196\n\nM.

In other words,\nit suffices to prove the proposition when X is a wedge of slice cells of dimension\ngreater than or equal to n.\nMaking use of the distributive law, and once again (B.170) and Proposition B.169,\none reduces to the case in which J = G/H is a single orbit, and X corresponds to\nS k\u03c1H with k|H| \u2265 n or S k\u03c1H \u22121 , with k|H| \u2212 1 \u2265 n.

It therefore\nfollows from our induction hypothesis that\nS(W )+ \u2227 X \u2227J\nis slice (n \u2212 1)-positive.

A value needs to be assigned\nto the effect of \u03a6G\nM on the map\nS \u2212W \u2227 JG (V, W ) \u2192 S \u2212V .\nThe only obvious choice is to take\n\u2212W\n\u2212V\n\u03a6G\n\u2227 JG (V, W )) \u2192 \u03a6G\n)\nM (S\nM (S\n\nto be the composite\n(B.188)\n\nG\n\nG\n\nG\n\nS \u2212W \u2227 JG (V, W )G \u2192 S \u2212W \u2227 J (V G , W G ) \u2192 S \u2212V .\n\nIf \u03a6G\nM actually were to commute with colimits, it would be determined by the\nspecifications given by (B.187) and (B.188).

The monoidal geometric fixed point functor\nG\n\u03a6G\nM :S \u2192S\n\nis the functor defined by the coequalizer diagram (B.189).\nRemark B.191. In case X = S \u2212V \u2227 A, the tautological presentation is a split\ncoequalizer, and one recovers both (B.187) and (B.188).\nA fundamental property of the usual geometric fixed point functor \u03a6G is that for\nproper H \u2282 G, the spectrum \u03a6G (G+ \u2227 X) is contractible. The monoidal geometric\nH\n\nfixed point functor has this property on the nose.\nProposition B.192. Suppose that J is a G-set and X an equivariant J-diagram.\nIf J has no G-fixed points then the map\n_\nXj ) \u2192 \u2217\n\u03a6G\nM\nj\u2208J\n\nis an isomorphism.

HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nProof: Since indexed wedges are computed componentwise, the assumption that\nJ has no fixed points implies that for all representations W of G,\n_\n_\n\u0001G\n\u0001G\nXj W =\n= \u2217.\n(Xj )W\nj\u2208J\n\nj\u2208J\n\nThe claim then follows from the definition of \u03a6G\nM.\n\n\u0003\n\nWorking through an equivariant cell decomposition gives\nCorollary B.193. Let A and Y be G-spectra. If X is constructed from A by attachG\ning G-cells induced from proper subgroups, then the map \u03a6G\nM (A \u2227 Y ) \u2192 \u03a6M (X \u2227 Y )\nis an isomorphism.\n\u0003\nThere is a natural map\nX G \u2192 \u03a6G\nMX\n\n(B.194)\n\nfrom the fixed point spectrum of X to the monoidal geometric fixed point spectrum.\nTo construct it note that the fixed point spectrum of X is computed termwise, and\nso is given by the coequalizer diagram\n_\n_\n(B.195)\nS \u2212W \u2227 J (V, W )+ \u2227 XVG \u21d2\nS \u2212V \u2227 XVG \u2192 X G .\nV,W \u2208J\n\nV \u2208J\n\nThe map (B.194) is given by the evident inclusion of (B.195) into (B.189).\nThe functor \u03a6G\nM cannot commute with all colimits. However, since colimits\nof orthogonal G-spectra are computed objectwise, the definition implies that \u03a6G\nM\ncommutes with whatever enriched colimits are preserved by the fixed point functor\non G-spaces. This means that there is a functorial isomorphism\n(B.196)\n\nG\nG\n\u03a6G\nM (X \u2227 A) \u2248 \u03a6M (X) \u2227 A\n\nfor each pointed G-space A, and that \u03a6G\nM commutes with the formation of wedges,\ndirected colimits and cobase change along a closed inclusion. Because h-cofibrations\nand cofibrations are objectwise closed inclusion (Lemma A.70 and Remark 5.38),\nthe functor \u03a6G\nM has good homotopy theoretic properties.\nB.10.3. Homotopy properties of \u03a6G\nM . Several variations on the following appear in\nin [53, \u00a7V.4].\nProposition B.197. The functor \u03a6G\nM sends cofibrations to cofibrations and acyclic\ncofibrations to acyclic cofibrations. It therefore sends weak equivalences between\ncofibrant objects to weak equivalences.\nProof: That \u03a6G\nM sends cofibrations to cofibrations follows from the fact that it\npreserves cobase change along closed inclusions and sends generating cofibrations\nto generating cofibrations. A similar argument applies to the acyclic cofibrations,\nonce one checks that \u03a6G\nM sends both maps in the factorization (B.67)\nS \u2212V \u2295W \u2227 S W \u2192 S\u0303 \u2212V \u2192 S \u2212V\nto weak equivalences. But the second map is a homotopy equivalence and the\ncomposite map is sent to a weak equivalence by (B.187). The last assertion is a\nconsequence of Ken Brown's Lemma.\n\u0003\nProposition B.197 implies that the monoidal geometric fixed point functor has\na left derived functor which can be computed on any cofibrant approximation. A\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n203\n\nsimilar argument with a slightly different model structure could be used to show\nthat the left derived functor can be computed on a cellular approximation.

From the formula (B.187) this map is an isomorphism\nif X = S \u2212V \u2227 A and Y = S \u2212W \u2227 B. This leads to\nProposition B.199 ([53], Proposition V.4.7). The functor \u03a6G\nM is weakly monoidal:\nthe map (B.198) is a weak equivalence (in fact an isomorphism) if X and Y are\ncellular.\nProof: The class of spectra X and Y for which (B.198) is an isomorphism is stable\nunder smashing with a G-space, the formation of wedges, directed colimits, and\ncobase change along an objectwise closed inclusion. Since (B.198) is an isomorphism\nwhen X = G+ \u2227 S \u2212V \u2227 A and Y = G+ \u2227 S \u2212W \u2227 B this implies it is an isomorphism\nH\n\nH\n\nwhen X and Y are cellular. Since isomorphisms are weak equivalences, the result\nfollows.\n\u0003\nRemark B.200. Blumberg and Mandell [10, Appendix A] have shown that Proposition B.199 remains true under the assumption that only one of X or Y is cellular.\nThis implies that Proposition B.203 below remains true if only one of N or N \u2032 is\ncofibrant.\nB.10.5. Relation with the geometric fixed point functor. We now turn to identifying\nG\nthe left derived functor L\u03a6G\nM with the geometric fixed point functor \u03a6 . The\n0\ninclusion S \u2192 \u1ebcP and the fibrant replacement functor give maps\nX \u2192 \u1ebcP \u2227 X \u2192 (\u1ebcP \u2227 X)f .\nProposition B.201 ([53], Proposition V.4.17). If X is cofibrant, then the maps\nG\n\u03a6G X = (\u1ebcP \u2227 Xf )G \u2192 \u03a6G\nM ((\u1ebcP \u2227 X)f ) \u2190 \u03a6M (X)\n\nare weak equivalences.\n\n\f204\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nSketch of proof: For the arrow on the left, note that both functors are homotopical and, up to weak equivalence, preserve filtered colimits along h-cofibrations.\nUsing the canonical homotopy presentation, it suffices to check that the arrow on\nthe left is a weak equivalence when X = S \u2212V \u2227 A, with A a G-CW complex. This\nfollows from Corollary B.185, the identity (B.187), and a little diagram chasing to\ncheck compatibility.\nThe right arrow is the composition of\nG\n\u03a6G\nM (X) \u2192 \u03a6M (\u1ebcP \u2227 X)\n\nwhich is an isomorphism by (B.196), and\nG\n\u03a6G\nM (\u1ebcP \u2227 X) \u2192 \u03a6M ((\u1ebcP \u2227 X)f ),\n\nwhich is an acyclic cofibration by Proposition B.197.\n\n\u0003\n\nB.10.6. The relative monoidal geometric fixed point functor. The functor \u03a6G\nM can\nbe formulated relative to an equivariant commutative or associative algebra R. As\ndescribed below, care must be taken in using the theory in this way.\nBecause it is lax monoidal, the functor \u03a6G\nM gives a functor\n\u03a6G\nM : MR \u2192 M\u03a6G\nMR\nwhich is lax monoidal in case R is commutative.\nProposition B.202. The functor\n\u03a6G\nM : MR \u2192 M\u03a6G\nMR\ncommutes with cobase change along a cofibration and preserves the classes of cofibrations and acyclic cofibrations.\nProof: This follows easily from the fact that the maps of equivariant orthogonal\nspectra underlying the generating cofibrations for MR are h-cofibrations.\n\u0003\nProposition B.203. When R is commutative, the functor\n\u03a6G\nM : MR \u2192 M\u03a6G\nMR\nis weakly monoidal, and in fact\n(B.204)\n\n\u2032\n\u03a6G\nM (N )\n\n\u2227\n\n\u03a6G\nM (R)\n\nG\n\u2032\n\u03a6G\nM (N ) \u2192 \u03a6M (N \u2227 N )\nR\n\n\u2032\n\nis an isomorphism if N and N are cofibrant.\n\n\u0003\n\nProof: The proof is the same as that of Proposition B.199 once one knows that\nthe class of modules N \u2032 and N for which (B.204) is an isomorphism is stable under\ncobase change along a generating cofibration. This, in turn, is a consequence of\nthe fact that both sides of (B.204) preserve h-cofibrations in each variable, since\nh-cofibrations are closed inclusions. The functor \u03a6G\nM does so since it commutes\nwith the formation of mapping cylinders, and N \u2032 \u2227 ( \u2212 ) does since MR is a closed\nsymmetric monoidal category.\n\nR\n\n\u0003\n\nAs promising as it looks, it is not so easy to make use of Proposition B.203. The\ntrouble is that unless X is cofibrant, \u03a6G\nM (X) may not have the weak homotopy type\nof \u03a6G (X). So in order to use Proposition B.203 one needs a condition guaranteeing\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n205\n\nthat N \u2032 \u2227 N is a cofibrant spectrum. The criterion of Proposition B.205 below was\nR\n\nsuggested to us by Mike Mandell.\nProposition B.205. Suppose R is an associative algebra with the property that\nS \u22121 \u2227 R is cofibrant. If N \u2032 is a cofibrant right R-module, and S \u22121 \u2227 N is a cofibrant\nleft R-module, then\nN\u2032 \u2227 N\nR\n\nis cofibrant.\n\nProof: First note that the condition on R guarantees that for every representation U with dim U G > 0 and every cofibrant G-space T , the spectrum\nS \u2212U \u2227 R \u2227 T\n\n(B.206)\n\nis cofibrant. Since the formation of N \u2032 \u2227 N commutes with cobase change in both\nR\n\nvariables, the result reduces to the case N \u2032 = S \u2212V \u2227 R \u2227 X and N = S \u2212W \u2227 R \u2227 Y\nwith V having a non-zero fixed point space, and X and Y cofibrant G-spaces. But\nin that case\nN \u2032 \u2227 N \u2248 S \u2212V \u2295W \u2227 R \u2227 X \u2227 Y\nR\n\nwhich is of the form (B.206), and hence cofibrant.\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary B.207. Suppose R is an associative algebra with the property that S \u22121 \u2227\nR is cofibrant. If N \u2032 is a cofibrant right R-module, then the equivariant orthogonal\nspectrum underlying N \u2032 is cofibrant.\n\nProof: Just take N = R in Proposition B.205.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe following result plays an important role in determining \u03a6G R(\u221e) (\u00a77.3).\nProposition B.208. Suppose that R is an equivariant associative algebra whose\nunderlying G-spectrum is cellular, and that R \u2192 S 0 is an equivariant associative\nalgebra map. If N \u2032 is a cofibrant right R-module, then N \u2032 \u2227 S 0 is a cofibrant\nR\n\nspectrum, and the map\n\u2032\n0\nG\n\u2032\n0\n\u03a6G\nM (N ) \u2227 S \u2192 \u03a6M (N \u2227 S )\n\u03a6G\nMR\n\nR\n\nis an isomorphism.\n\nProof: One easily reduces to the case N \u2032 = S \u2212V \u2227 X \u2227 R, in which V is a\nrepresentation with V G 6= 0, and X is a cofibrant G-space. In this case N \u2032 \u2227 S 0 is\nR\n\nisomorphic to S \u2212V \u2227 X which is cofibrant. The assertion about monoidal geometric\n\u0003\nfixed points follows easily from Proposition B.199.\n\n\f206\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nB.11. Geometric fixed points and the norm. Our original version of the following result merely concluded that the transformation in question was a weak\nequivalence on cofibrant objects.

Next note that for an orthogonal representation V of\nH, Proposition A.59 and the property (B.187) give isomorphisms\nG\n\nG \u2212V\n\u2212 indH V\n\u03a6G\n\u2248 \u03a6G\n\u2248 S \u2212V\nM NH S\nMS\n\nH\n\n\u2248 \u03a6H S \u2212V .\n\nThe monoidal properties of \u03a6G\nM and the norm then combine to give an isomorphism\nG\n\u03a6H (S \u2212V \u2227 A) \u2248 \u03a6G NH\n(S \u2212V \u2227 A)\n\n(B.210)\n\nwhich one easily checks to be compatible with the maps\nS \u2212V \u2227 JH (W, V ) \u2192 S \u2212W .\nTo construct the transformation, write a general H-spectrum X in terms of its\ntautological presentation\n_\n_\nS \u2212W \u2227 JH (V, W ) \u2227 XV \u21d2\nS \u2212V \u2227 XV \u2192 X,\nV,W\n\nV\n\nand apply (B.210) termwise to produce a diagram\n_\n_\nH\nH\nG\nS \u2212W \u2227 JH (V, W )H \u2227 XVH \u21d2\nS \u2212V \u2227 XVH \u2192 \u03a6G NH\nX.\nV,W\n\nV\n\nThe coequalizer of the two arrows is, by definition, \u03a6H\nM (X). This gives the natural\ntransformation.\nThe isomorphism assertion for cellular X reduces to the special case (B.210),\nG\nonce one show that \u03a6G\nM \u25e6 NH ( \u2212 ) commute with the formation of wedges, cobase\nchange along cofibrations between cofibrant objects, and filtered colimits along\nclosed inclusions. The last property is clear since both of the functors being composed commutes with filtered colimits along closed inclusions. For the other two\nassertions it will be easier to work in terms of equivariant J-diagrams for J = G/H.\nSuppose that T is an indexing set, and Xt , t \u2208 T a set of equivariant J-diagrams.\nWe wish to show that the natural map\n_\n_\n\u0001\u2227J\n\u2227J\n(B.211)\nXt\n\u03a6G\n\u2192 \u03a6G\nM\nM Xt\nt\u2208T\n\nt\u2208T\n\nis an isomorphism.

But since G acts\ntrivially on T , the other summands form an indexed wedge over a G-set with no\nfixed points. The claim then follows from Proposition B.192.\nThe cobase change property is similar. Suppose we are given a pushout square\nof equivariant J-diagrams\n/B\nA\n\u000f\n\u000f\n/Y\nX\nin which A \u2192 B is a cofibration and A is cofibrant.

Proposition B.213 applies in particular when X is very flat in the\nsense of \u00a7B.8.2. By Proposition B.147 this means that if R \u2208 SH is a cofibrant\nG\ncommutative ring, then \u03a6H R and \u03a6G NH\nR are related by a functorial zig-zag of\nweak equivalences. The case of interest to us is when H = C2 , G = C2n and\nG\nR = M UR . In this case NH\nR = M U ((G)), and we get an equivalence\n\u03a6G M U ((G)) \u2248 \u03a6C2 M UR \u2248 M O.\nRemark B.216. Proposition B.213 also applies to the suspension spectra of cofibrant\nH-spaces. Indeed, if X is a cofibrant H-space then S \u22121 \u2227 S 1 \u2227 X \u2192 X is a cofibrant\nG\napproximation. Applying NH\nleads to the map\nG\nG\nS \u2212V \u2227 S V \u2227 NH\n(X) \u2192 NH\n(X)\n\nwith V = indG\nH R, which is a weak equivalence (in fact a cofibrant approximation).\nG\nThis case is used to show that \u03a6G \u25e6 NH\nis a ring homomorphism on the RO(G)graded cohomology of G-spaces (Proposition 2.59).\nB.12. Real bordism. In this section we give a construction of the real bordism\nspectrum M UR as a commutative algebra in SC2 . As will be apparent to the\nreader, this construction owes a great deal to the Stefan Schwede's construction\nof M U in [74, Chapter 2]. We are indebted to Schwede for some very helpful\ncorrespondence concerning these matters.\nOur goal is to construct a C2 -equivariant commutative ring M UR admitting the\ncanonical homotopy presentation\nn\n\nM UR \u2248 holim S \u2212C \u2227 M U (n),\n\u2212\u2192\nin which M U (n) is the Thom complex of the universal bundle over BU (n). The\ngroup C2 is acting on everything by complex conjugation, so we could also write\nthis expression as\n(B.217)\n\n(B.218)\n\nM UR \u2248 holim S \u2212n\u03c12 \u2227 M U (n).\n\u2212\u2192\n\nThe map\n\nS \u2212\u03c12 \u2227 M U (1) \u2192 M UR\ndefines a real orientation. These things form the basis for everything we proved\nabout M UR .\nThe most natural construction of M UR realizes this structure in the category SR\nof real spectra, which is related to the category of C2 -equivariant orthogonal spectra\nby a multiplicative Quillen equivalence\ni ! : SR \u21c6 SC 2 : i \u2217 .\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n209\n\nWe will construct a commutative algebra MU R \u2208 comm SR , whose underlying real\nspectrum has a canonical homotopy presentation of the form\n\u223c\n\n\u223c\n\n\u2212 holim S \u2212nC \u2227 M U (n) \u2212\n\u2192 holim S \u2212nC \u2227 M U (n)cf .\nMU R \u2190\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\nApplying i! to (B.219) and making the identification i! S \u2212C = S \u2212\u03c12 leads to the\ndiagram\n(B.219)\n\ni! MU R \u2190 holim S \u2212n\u03c12 \u2227 M U (n) \u2192 holim S \u2212n\u03c12 \u2227 M U (n)cf .\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\nWe define M UR to be the spectrum i! MU \u2032R , where MU \u2032R \u2192 MU R is a cofibrant\ncommutative algebra approximation. The functor i! is strictly monoidal, so M UR is\na commutative ring in SC2 . The map on the right in (B.220) is a weak equivalence\nsince i! is a left Quillen functor. The problem is to show that the one on the left is.\nThis involves two steps. The first is to show that the forgetful functor\n(B.220)\n\ncomm SR \u2192 SR\ncreates a model category structure on comm SR . This involves analyzing the symmetric powers of cofibrant real spectra, which, as pointed out in Remark B.120\ndepends in an essential way on understanding the homotopy theoretic properties\nof indexed symmetric powers. The second is to show that the functor i! is homotopical on a subcategory of SR containing the real spectra underlying cofibrant\nreal commutative rings. As in our analysis of norms of commutative rings, this\ninvolves a generalized notion of flatness. There is no real way to short circuit the\nmodel structure on comm SR . Its role is to identify the cofibrant real commutative\nalgebras. But the only real work in establishing the model structure is showing\nthat what one thinks is a cofibrant approximation is actually a weak equivalence,\nand that is what is needed to show that every real commutative algebra is weakly\nequivalent to a cofibrant one.\nB.12.1. Real and complex spectra. In this section we describe the basics of real and\ncomplex spectra. The additive results are more or less all a special case of the results\nof [54], but the important multiplicative properties require a separate analysis.\nFor finite dimensional complex Hermitian vector spaces A and B let U (A, B) be\nthe Stiefel manifold of unitary embeddings A \u0592\u2192 B. There is a natural Hermitian\ninner product on the complexification VC of a real orthogonal vector space V , so\nthere is a natural map\nO(V, W ) \u2192 U (VC , WC ).\nThe group C2 acts on U (VC , WC ) by complex conjugation, and the fixed point space\nis O(V, W ).\nDefinition B.221. The category JC is the topological category whose objects are\nfinite dimensional Hermitian vector spaces, and whose morphism space JC (A, B)\nis the Thom complex\nJC (A, B) = Thom(U (A, B); B \u2212 A).\nThe category JR is the C2 -equivariant topological category whose objects are finite\ndimensional orthogonal real vector spaces V , and with\nJR (V, W ) = JC (VC , WC ),\non which C2 acts by complex conjugation.\n\n\f210\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nDefinition B.222. The category SC of complex spectra is the topological category\nof (continuous) functors\nJC \u2192 T .\nThe category SR of real spectra is the topological category of C2 -enriched functors\nJR \u2192 T C2 ,\nand equivariant natural transformations.\nWe will write\nV 7\u2192 XVC\nfor a typical real spectrum X, and let S \u2212VC \u2208 SR be the functor co-represented by\nV \u2208 JR . From the Yoneda lemma there is a natural isomorphism\nSR (S \u2212VC , X) = XVC .\nAs with equivariant orthogonal spectra, every real spectrum X has a tautological\npresentation\n_\n_\n(B.223)\nS \u2212WC \u2227 JR (V, W ) \u2227 XWC \u21d2\nS \u2212VC \u2227 XVC \u2192 X.\nV,W \u2208JR\n\nV \u2208JR\n\nA similar apparatus exist for complex spectra.\nRemark B.224. The category JR is equivalent to its full subcategory with objects\nRn , and similarly JC is equivalent to its full subcategory with objects Cn . Thus\na real spectrum X is specified by the spaces XVC with V = Rn together with the\nstructure maps between them, and an object Y \u2208 SC is specified by its spaces YCn ,\ntogether with the structure maps between them.\nThe group C2 acts on SC through its action on JC . We write this as X 7\u2192 X\u0304,\nwhere\n(X\u0304)V = XV\u0304 .\nA fixed point for this action is a complex spectrum X equipped with an isomor \u0304 = X is the identity map.\nphism X \u2192 X\u0304 having the property that X \u2192 X\u0304 \u2192 X\u0304\nRestricting to the spaces XCn and using the standard basis to identify Cn with C\u0304n\none sees that a fixed point for this C2 -action consists of a sequence C2 -spaces XCn ,\ntogether with an associative family C2 -equivariant maps\nJC (Cn , Cm ) \u2227U(Cn ) XCn \u2192 XCm ,\nwhere C2 is acting by conjugation. But this is the same thing as giving a real\nspectrum indexed on the spaces Rn . This shows that the category of fixed points\nfor the C2 -action on SC is SR .\nB.12.2. Smash product and indexed smash products. The orthogonal sum makes\nJC into a symmetric monoidal category and JR an T C2 -enriched symmetric\nmonoidal category. Using this one can define the smash product X \u2227 Y giving\nboth SR and SC the structure of symmetric monoidal categories. The smash product in SR is specified by the formula\nS \u2212VC \u2227 S \u2212WC = S \u2212(V \u2295W )C\nand the fact that it commutes with colimits in each variable. A similar characterization holds for SC .\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n211\n\nThere are indexed monoidal products in this context. Let J be a finite set with\na C2 -action. The actions of C2 on J and on SC combine to give an action on the\nproduct category SJC . The category of SJR of real J-diagrams is the category of fixed\npoints for this action. The category of real J-diagrams for J = {pt} is equivalent\nto SR . When J = C2 , the category of real J-diagrams is equivalent to SC . For\ngeneral J = n1 + n2 C2 , one has an equivalence\nSJR \u2248 SnR1 \u00d7 SnC2 .\nThere are indexed wedges and indexed smash products from SJR to SR .\nB.12.3. Homotopy theory of real and complex spectra. We now turn to the homotopy theory of real and complex spectra. We describe the case of SR and leave the\nanalogous case of SC to the reader.\nSuppose that X is a real spectrum. For H \u2282 C2 and k \u2208 Z set\nH\nXVC .\n\u03c0kH (X) = lim \u03c0k+V\nC\n\u2212\u2192\nV\n\nThe colimit is taken over the poset of finite dimensional orthogonal vector spaces\nover R, ordered (in agreement with Definition 2.3) by dimension. A stable weak\nequivalence in SR is a map X \u2192 Y inducing an isomorphism \u03c0kH X \u2192 \u03c0kH Y for all\nH \u2282 C2 and k \u2208 Z. For fixed k, the groups \u03c0kH form a Mackey functor which we\ndenote \u03c0 k .\nEquipped with the stable weak equivalences, the category SR becomes a homotopical category. We refine it to a model category by defining a map to be a fibration\nif for each non-zero V , the map XVC \u2192 YVC is a fibration in T C2 . The cofibrations\nare the maps having the left lifting property against the acyclic fibrations. This is\nthe positive stable model structure on SR .\nThe positive stable model structure is cofibrantly generated. The generating\ncofibrations can be taken to be the maps of the form\n\u0001\nn\u22121\nn\n\u2192 D+\nS \u2212VC \u2227 S+\nand\n\nn\u22121\nn\n(C2 )+ \u2227 S \u2212VC \u2227 S+\n\u2192 D+\n\n\u0001\n\nwith V > 0. The generating acyclic cofibrations are the analogous maps\n\u0001\nn\u22121\nS \u2212VC \u2227 I+\n\u2192 In\n\nand\n\nn\u22121\n(C2 )+ \u2227 S \u2212VC \u2227 I+\n\u2192 In\n\ntogether with the corner maps formed by smashing\n(B.225)\n\n\u0001\n\nS \u2212VC \u2295WC \u2227 S WC \u2192 S\u0303 \u2212VC\n\nn\u22121\nn\u22121\nn\nn\n). We assume V > 0, while\nand (C2 )+ \u2227 (S+\n\u2192 D+\nwith the maps S+\n\u2192 D+\nW need not be. The map (B.225) is extracted from the factorization\n\nS \u2212VC \u2295WC \u2227 S WC \u2192 S\u0303 \u2212VC \u2192 S \u2212VC\nformed by applying the small object construction with the generating cofibrations.\nAs in the case of the complete positive stable model structure on SG , the map\n\n\f212\n\nM. A. HILL, M. J. HOPKINS, AND D. C. RAVENEL\n\nS\u0303 \u2212VC \u2192 S \u2212VC is a homotopy equivalence. The verification of the model category\naxioms is straightforward. See \u00a7B.4.1 or [54].\nB.12.4. Real spectra and C2 -spectra. Let\ni : JR \u2192 JC2\nbe the functor sending V to\nV\u03c12 = V \u2297 \u03c12 .\nThen the restriction functor\ni \u2217 : S C 2 \u2192 SR\nhas both a left and right adjoint which we denote i! and i\u2217 respectively. The left\nadjoint sends S \u2212VC to S \u2212V\u03c12 , and is described in general by applying the functor\ntermwise to the tautological presentation.\nSince the functor i is symmetric monoidal, the left adjoint i! is strongly symmetric\nmonoidal.\nProposition B.226. The functors\ni ! : SR \u21c6 SC 2 : i \u2217\nform a Quillen equivalence.\nRemark B.227. A similar discussion leads to a Quillen equivalence\nSC \u21c6 S.\nProof: Since i! is a left adjoint and\ni! (S \u2212VC \u2227 A) = S \u2212V\u03c12 \u2227 A\nit is immediate that i! sends the generating (acyclic) cofibrations to (acyclic) cofibrations, and hence is a left Quillen functor. Using the fact that the sequence\n{Rn \u2297 \u03c12 } is exhausting, one can easily check that a map X \u2192 Y in SC2 is a weak\nequivalence if and only if i\u2217 X \u2192 i\u2217 Y is. This means that to show that i! and i\u2217\nform a Quillen equivalence it suffices to show that the unit map\nX \u2192 i\u2217 i! X\n\n(B.228)\n\nis a weak equivalence for every cofibrant X \u2208 SR . Since i\u2217 is also a left adjoint, it\npreserves colimits, and therefore so does i\u2217 i! . Since both functors also commute with\nsmashing with a C2 -space, we are reduced to checking that for each 0 6= V \u2208 JR ,\nthe map\nS \u2212VC \u2192 i\u2217 S \u2212V\u03c12\n\n(B.229)\n\nis a weak equivalence.\nFor W \u2208 JR , the WC -space of S \u2212VC is\nJR (V, W ) = Thom(U (VC , WC ); WC \u2212 VC )\nand the W -space of i\u2217 S \u2212V\u03c12 is\nJC2 (V\u03c12 , W\u03c12 ) = Thom(O(V\u03c12 , W\u03c12 ); W\u03c12 \u2212 V\u03c12 ).\nThe unit of the adjunction is derived from the inclusion U (VC , WC ) \u2192 O(V\u03c12 , W\u03c12 ).\nWe must therefore show that for each k, the map\n(B.230)\n\nlim \u03c0 k+WC JR (VC , WC ) \u2192 lim \u03c0 k+WC JC2 (V\u03c12 , W\u03c12 )\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\n\nW \u2208JR\n\nW \u2208JR\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n213\n\nis an isomorphism.\nWe may suppose that dim W > dim V . For a fixed W choose an orthogonal\nembedding V \u2282 W , write W = V \u2295 U , and consider the diagram\nS UC\n\n/ JR (V, W )\n\n\u2248\n\n\u000f\nS U\u03c12\n\n\u000f\n/ JC2 (V\u03c12 , W\u03c12 ) .\n\nThe left vertical map is an equivariant isomorphism. A straightforward argument\nusing the connectivity of Stiefel manifolds shows that for dim W \u226b 0 the horizontal\nC2\nu\nmaps are isomorphisms in both \u03c0k+W\nand \u03c0k+W\n. It follows that the right vertical\nC\nC\n\u0003\nmap is as well, and hence so is (B.230).\nFor later reference, we record one fact that emerged in the proof of Proposition B.226.\nLemma B.231. The functor i\u2217 reflects weak equivalences: a map X \u2192 Y \u2208 SC2\nis a weak equivalence if and only if i\u2217 X \u2192 i\u2217 Y is.\n\u0003\nB.12.5. Multiplicative aspects of real spectra. The multiplicative homotopy theory\nof real spectra is similar to that of SG . Though there does not seem to be a simple\nway to directly deduce the results from the case of SC2 , the proofs are very similar.\nProposition B.232. If J is a set with a C2 -action and X \u2192 Y is a cofibration\nof cofibrant real J-diagrams, then both the indexed corner map \u2202X Y \u2227J \u2192 Y \u2227J and\nthe absolute map X \u2227J \u2192 Y \u2227J are cofibrations between cofibrant objects. They are\nweak equivalences if X \u2192 Y is.\nProof: This is an analogue of Propositions B.96 and B.103, and is proved in the\nsame way, using the arrow category and the filtration of \u00a7A.3.4.\n\u0003\nFor the symmetric powers, we fix a C2 -set J and a C2 -stable subgroup \u03a3 \u2282 \u03a3I .\nThe following is an analog of Proposition B.117 and, making use of Proposition B.232, is proved in the same manner.\nProposition B.233. If X \u2208 SR is cofibrant and Z is any real spectrum equipped\nwith an action of \u03a3 \u22ca C2 extending the G-action, then the map\n(EC2 \u03a3)+ \u2227 (X \u2227J \u2227 Z) \u2192 (X \u2227J \u2227 Z)/\u03a3.\n\u03a3\n\nis a weak equivalence.\n\n\u0003\n\nProposition B.234. If A \u2192 B is a cofibration of cofibrant real spectra and J is a\nfinite set with a C2 -action, then in the diagram\nEC2 \u03a3+ \u2227 \u2202A B \u2227J\n\n/ EC2 \u03a3+ \u2227 B \u2227J\n\n\u000f\n\u2202A SymJ B\n\n\u000f\n/ SymJ B\n\n\u03a3\n\n\u03a3\n\nthe upper row is a cofibration between cofibrant objects, the vertical maps are weak\nequivalences and remain so after smashing with any object, and the bottom row is an\nh-cofibration of flat spectra.

RAVENEL\n\nProof: This is an analogue of Proposition B.109 and is proved in the same way,\nmaking use of Proposition B.233.\n\u0003\nProposition B.235. The forgetful functor\ncomm SR \u2192 SR\ncreates a model category structure on commutative algebras in SR , in which a map of\ncommutative algebras is a fibration or weak equivalence if and only if the underlying\nmap of real spectra is.\nProof: This is proved in the same manner as Proposition B.130, making use of\nProposition B.234.\n\u0003\nB.12.6. Generalized flatness. Our next task is to show that the left derived functor\nof i! can be computed on a subcategory of real spectra containing those which\nunderlie real commutative rings.\nDefinition B.236.

Since i! is a left Quillen functor and cofibrant objects of SC2 are\nflat, cofibrant objects of SR are i! -flat.\nRemark B.239. If (B.237) is a weak equivalence for one cofibrant approximation it\nis a weak equivalence for any cofibrant approximation.\nOur main result is\nProposition B.240. If R \u2208 SR is a cofibrant commutative algebra then R is i! -flat.\nThe proof of Proposition B.240 follows the argument for the proof of Proposition B.147.\nLemma B.241. If A \u2208 SR is cofibrant, and n \u2265 1, then Symn A is i! -flat.\nProof: By Proposition B.233, the map\n(EC2 \u03a3n )+ \u2227 A\u2227n \u2192 Symn A\n\u03a3n\n\nis a cofibrant approximation.

If S \u2192 T is an h-cofibration in SR , and two of S, T , T /S are\ni! -flat, then so is the third.\nProof: We may choose a map S\u0303 \u2192 T\u0303 of cofibrant approximations which is a\ncofibration, hence an h-cofibration. Our assumption is that two of the vertical\nmaps in\n/ i! T\u0303 \u2227 Z\u0303\n/ i! (T\u0303 /S\u0303) \u2227 Z\u0303\ni! S\u0303 \u2227 Z\u0303\n\u000f\ni! S \u2227 Z\n\n\u000f\n/ i!

The top row of (B.247) is an\nh-cofibration, so Lemma B.245 implies that film Y is i! -flat. This completes the\ninductive step, and the proof.\n\u0003\nThough we don't quite need the following result, having come this far we record\nit for future reference.\nProposition B.248. The functors i! and i\u2217 restrict to a Quillen equivalence\ni! : comm SR \u21c6 comm SC2 : i\u2217 .\nProof: It is immediate from the definition of the model structures on comm SR\nand comm SC2 , and the fact that\ni ! : SR \u21c6 SC 2 : i \u2217\nis a Quillen pair, that\ni\u2217 : comm SC2 \u2192 comm SR\npreserves the classes of fibrations and acyclic fibrations. It remains to show that if\nA \u2208 comm SR is cofibrant, then the composition\nA \u2192 i\u2217 i! A \u2192 i\u2217 (i! Af )\nis a weak equivalence, where i! A \u2192 i! Af is a fibrant replacement. Since i\u2217 reflects\nweak equivalences (Lemma B.231) this is equivalent to showing that\nA \u2192 i\u2217 i! A\nis a weak equivalence. Let A\u2032 \u2192 A be a cofibrant approximation in SR , and consider\nthe following diagram in SR\n(B.249)\n\nA\u2032\n\u223c\n\n\u000f\nA\n\n\u223c\n\n/ i\u2217 i! A\u2032\n\u223c\n\n\u000f\n/ i\u2217 i! A .\n\nBy Proposition B.240 the map i! A\u2032 \u2192 i! A is a weak equivalence. The rightmost\narrow in (B.249) is therefore a weak equivalence. The top arrow is a weak equivalence by Proposition B.226, and the left arrow is a weak equivalence by assumption.\nThis implies that the bottom arrow is a weak equivalence.\n\u0003\n\n\fKERVAIRE INVARIANT ONE\n\n217\n\nB.12.7. The real bordism spectrum. For V \u2208 JR let\nM U (VC ) = Thom(BU (VC ), VC )\nbe the Thom complex of the bundle EU (VC ) \u00d7 VC over BU (VC ), equipped with\nU(VC )\n\nthe C2 -action of complex conjugation. We will take our model of BU (VC ) to be the\none given by Segal's construction [77], so that\n(B.250)\n\nV 7\u2192 Thom(BU (VC ), VC )\n\nis a lax symmetric monoidal functor JR \u2192 T C2 , and so defines a commutative ring\nMU R \u2208 comm SR . Let MU \u2032R \u2192 MU R be a cofibrant approximation to MU R in\ncomm SR .\nDefinition B.251. The real bordism spectrum is the spectrum M UR = i! MU \u2032R .\nTo get at the homotopy type of M UR , we examine the canonical homotopy\npresentation of MU R using the exhausting sequence Vn = Rn . This gives a weak\nequivalence\nn\n\n\u223c\n\nholim S \u2212C \u2227 M U (n) \u2212\n\u2192 MU \u2032R\n\u2212\u2192\nin which M U (n) = M U (Cn ). Applying i! and using Proposition B.240 gives\n(B.252)\n\n\u223c\n\n\u2192 M UR .\nholim S \u2212n\u03c12 \u2227 M U (n) \u2212\n\u2212\u2192\nIn this presentation the universal real orientation of M UR (Example 5.5) is given\nby restricting to the term n = 1\nS \u2212\u03c12 \u2227 M U (1) \u2192 M UR .\nThe next result summarizes some further consequences of the presentation (B.252).\nProposition B.253. i) The non-equivariant spectrum underlying M UR is the\nusual complex cobordism spectrum M U .\nii) The equivariant cohomology theory represented by M UR coincides with the one\nstudied in [43, 24, 6, 35].\niii) There is an equivalence\n\u03a6C2 M UR \u2248 M O.\niv) The Schubert cell decomposition of Grassmannians leads to a cofibrant approximation of M UR by a C2 -CW complex with one 0-cell (S 0 ) and the remaining cells\nof the form em\u03c12 , with m > 0.\nReferences\n[1] J.
