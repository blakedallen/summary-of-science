The configurations that are included correspond to the regular, spherical states as well as two-particle two-hole\nand four-particle four-hole excitations across the Z = 82 shell gap.\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nDuring the last years, ample evidence for the presence of intruder excitations,\nin particular at and near closed-shell regions [1, 2] has been accumulated\nthroughout the nuclear mass table. Such intruder excitations, which give\nrise to shape coexistence and collective band structures, are particularly well\ndocumented in the Z = 50 (Sn) and Z = 82 (Pb) mass regions. They can be\nassociated with many-particle many-hole proton excitations across the closed\nshells [3] but can also be studied, in an equivalent way, using potential energy\nsurface calculations [4].\nAfter the discovery of 0+ intruder excitations in the even-even Pb nuclei,\ndown to mass A = 192 [5\u20138], the development of recoil and recoil-decaytagging (RDT) techniques and of heavy-ion induced fusion-evaporation reactions [9] have led to a wealth of new data on collective bands in the Pb\nisotopes that have neutron number near N = 104. The large number of experiments carried out over the last few years are described in a review paper\nby Julin et al. [10]. Study of the fine-structure of alpha decay of the very\nneutron-deficient nuclei has also proven to be an excellent tool [11] to identify excited 0+ states and was used for the first observation of a set of three\nlow-lying 0+ excitations in 186 Pb [12, 13]. The above two major experimental\ntechniques have been instrumental in exploring unexpected new phenomena\nconcerning intruder states and shape coexistence.\nWith these methods, data have become available on 188 Pb [14\u201317], 186 Pb\n[12, 13, 18], 184 Pb [19, 20] and 182 Pb [21]. The experimental evidence for closelying 0+ excitations and for associated collective band structures (see Fig. 1)\nhas brought about the need to explore and study the effects of mixing among\nthese structures. A first attempt using two-level mixing for the low-lying 0+\nand 2+ excitations in 190\u2212200 Pb was carried out by Van Duppen et al. [22].\nThe importance of mixing between bands was put in a broader context by\nDracoulis [23] in the Os-Pt-Hg-Pb region. More recently, detailed two-band\nmixing calculations [24, 25] and an attempt to perform a three-band mixing\nstudy in 186 Pb [26] have been reported, albeit all starting from phenomenological band-mixing assumptions. So, there is a clear need to perform a\ndetailed study of these nuclei. We also mention that intruder 0+ states and\nassociated bands have been studied in the neutron-deficient Pt nuclei [27\u201333]\ndown to mass A = 168 and in the Po nuclei [34\u201341] in an effort to distinguish\ncollective vibrational excitations from intruder states.\n2\n\n\fDeformed mean-field calculations [4, 42\u201345] have indicated the possibility\nof obtaining oblate and prolate minima close to the spherical ground-state\nconfiguration in the total energy surface for the Pb nuclei for neutron numbers close to N = 104. In the Hg nuclei with a ground state corresponding\nto a slightly deformed oblate configuration, a second, prolate configuration\nis predicted with minimal energy near mid-shell (N = 104), while in the Pt\nnuclei a crossing of both minima is found and the prolate deformed minimum\nbecomes the lowest configuration at mid-shell. In the Po nuclei the situation is more complicated [46] with an oblate minimum which approaches the\nspherical ground-state configuration near N = 110, and a prolate minimum\nwhich becomes dominant in the ground state for even lower neutron numbers. The above studies have the drawback that only the static potential\nenergy surface properties are studied.\nMany-particle many-hole (mp-nh) excitations cannot be incorporated\neasily in full large-scale shell-model studies because of the extremely large\ndimensions of the model spaces involved. These mp-nh excitations, however, can be handled within an algebraic framework of the Interacting Boson\nModel (IBM) [47, 48]. The inclusion in IBM of the simplest 2p-2h intruder\nexcitations in the form of two extra nucleon pairs (two bosons) and the study\nof the mixing with the regular configurations was suggested by Duval and\nBarrett [49] and applied in the Pb region to the Hg nuclei [50, 51], the Pt\nnuclei [52] and the Po nuclei [46]. These IBM-mixing calculations, however,\ngenerally implied the introduction of many parameters. Calculations including up to 6p-6h excitations have been carried out, using a simplified Hamiltonian, with the aim of studying high-spin properties and backbending within\nthe IBM configuration mixing picture by J. Jolie et al [53, 54]. In an effort\nto remove the obstacle of introducing many parameters when carrying out\nsuch IBM configuration mixing calculations with various mp-nh excitations,\nthe symmetries connecting particle and hole bosons have been put forward\nin an algebraic framework and led to the introduction of a new label, called\nintruder spin or I spin [55] and to applications in the Pb region [56]. In this\napproach, explored in detail in a series of papers [57\u201360], both the particle\nand hole shell-model configurations are handled as interacting particle- and\nhole-like s and d bosons. The method also allows, in principle, the mixing of\ntwo dynamical symmetries.\nThe experimental need to explore three families each with a different intrinsic structure (spherical, oblate and prolate or, in a spherical shell-model\n3\n\n\flanguage, the 2p-2h and 4p-4h intruder excitations next to the regular ones\nof 0p-0h type) forms the starting point of the present study. An exploratory\ncalculation of this kind within an algebraic framework has already been reported [61, 62] but was confined to the 0+ band heads. In this paper an\nIBM-mixing calculation that describes the three different intrinsic 'shape'\nconfigurations is performed, and applied to the very neutron-deficient Pb\nnuclei.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nThe configuration mixing model\nHamiltionian\n\nThe regular (reg) 0p-0h states are described in terms of N bosons while the\nintruder 2p-2h and 4p-4h states require N + 2 and N + 4 bosons, respectively. The model space thus consists of the sum of three symmetric U(6)\nrepresentations [N] \u2295 [N + 2] \u2295 [N + 4]. The model Hamiltonian has the form\n\u0124 = \u0124reg + \u01242p2h + \u01244p4h + V\u0302mix .\n\n(1)\n\nThe different parts are\n\u0124reg = \u01ebreg n\u0302d + \u03bareg Q\u0302reg * Q\u0302reg ,\n\n(2)\n\n\u01242p2h = \u01eb2p2h n\u0302d + \u03ba2p2h Q\u03022p2h * Q\u03022p2h + \u22062p2h ,\n\n(3)\n\n\u01244p4h = \u01eb4p4h n\u0302d + \u03ba4p4h Q\u03024p4h * Q\u03024p4h + \u22064p4h ,\n\n(4)\n\nwith the d-boson number operator n\u0302d and the quadrupole operator\nQ\u0302i = s\u2020 d \u0303 + d\u2020 s\u0303\n\u0010\n\n\u0011(2)\n\n\u0011(2)\n\n+ \u03c7i d\u2020 d \u0303\n\u0010\n\n,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere i stands for a regular, 2p-2h or 4p-4h configuration. The parameter\n\u22062p2h corresponds to the single-particle energy needed to create a 2p-2h excitation, corrected for the gain in binding energy due to pairing. Likewise,\n\u22064p4h corresponds to the single-particle energy needed to create a 4p-4h excitation (corrected for pairing), with \u22064p4h \u2248 2\u22062p2h . Eigensolutions depend\nprimarily on the ratio \u01eb/\u03ba. For \u01eb \u226b \u03ba the solution is vibrational while for\n\u01eb \u226a \u03ba it is rotational. In addition, the parameter \u03c7 in the quadrupole\noperator\nq (5) determines whether the solution is SU(3) (axially deformed,\n\u03c7 = \u00b1 74 ) or SO(6) (triaxially unstable, \u03c7 = 0). The Hamiltonians used\n4\n\n\fin (1) represent the simplest parametrisation of the IBM which encompasses\nits different limits, U(5) vibrational, SU(3) rotational and SO(6) \u03b3 soft. Often a rotational term L\u03022 is added but this is not needed here.\nThe mixing of the different configurations is induced by V\u0302mix , which is\nassumed to be of lowest possible order in the s and d bosons,\nV\u0302mix = V\u0302mix,1 + V\u0302mix,2 ,\n\n(6)\n\nwith\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\nV\u0302mix,i = \u03b1i s\u2020 s\u2020 + \u03b2i d\u2020 d\u2020\n\n\u0011(0)\n\n+ hermitian conjugate,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere i = 1, 2 and V\u0302mix,1 mixes the regular (0p-0h) and 2p-2h configurations\nwhile V\u0302mix,2 mixes the 2p-2h and 4p-4h configurations. Note that care is taken\nto introduce different (0p-0h)-(2p-2h) and (2p-2h)-(4p-4h) mixing parameters, (\u03b11 , \u03b21 ) and (\u03b12 , \u03b22 ), respectively, and that there is no direct mixing\nbetween the 0p-0h and 4p-4h configurations. The latter statement is suggested by the observation that the matrix element of a two-body interaction\nbetween 0p-0h and 4p-4h states is zero.\nTo obtain an estimate of the relation between (\u03b11 , \u03b21 ) and (\u03b12 , \u03b22 ), assume\nin first approximation that the dominant component of the 2p-2h and 4p4h configurations involves pairs of particles (holes) in a single jp (jh ) shell\ncoupled to zero angular momentum. For a pairing force the following ratio\nof mixing matrix elements is obtained:\nD\nD\n\n0 V\u0302pairing jp2 (0)jh2 (0)\n\njp2 (0)jh2 (0) V\u0302pairing\n\nE\n\nv\nu\n\n1 u (2jp + 1)(2jh + 1)\nE = t\n\u2248 0.5.\n2 (2jp \u2212 1)(2jh \u2212 1)\njp4 (0)jh4 (0)\n\n(8)\n\nIn the limit of large shells, the mixing between the 2p-2h and 4p-4h 0+\nstates is thus twice as strong as that between the ground state and the 2p2h states. In contrast, the corresponding ratio, obtained with the mixing\nHamiltonian (6) and a U(5) vibrational classification of states, equals\nD\nD\n\nsN V\u0302mix sN +2\n\nsN +2 V\u0302mix\n\nE\n\nv\nu\n\n\u03b11 u\nt (N + 1)(N + 2) .\nE =\n\u03b12 (N + 3)(N + 4)\nsN +4\n\n(9)\n\nIn the limit of large boson number, \u03b12 should thus be twice as big as \u03b11 to\nrecover the ratio in eq. (8). In the present application to the Pb isotopes, the\n5\n\n\fboson number N is such that the square root in eq. (9) equals about 0.8, by\nwhich factor \u03b12 should be reduced to account for the finite boson number.\nAnother and perhaps more important fact is that both eqs. (8) and (9) are\nderived for a spherical configuration. It is clear that deformation may drastically change the ratio of mixing matrix elements and, specifically, it may\nreduce both matrix elements because of the smaller overlap between states\nwith different deformation. Thus the microscopic estimate \u03b12 \u2248 2\u03b11 cannot be adhered to rigidly and several calculations corresponding to different\ncombinations of mixing matrix elements must be explored.\n\n2.2\n2.2.1\n\nParametrisation from known experimental data\nThe regular configuration\n\nIn the even-even Pb nuclei, 126 \u2212 N valence neutrons form a ground state\nwhich is predominantly of seniority zero, v = 0. This can be viewed as a\ncondensate of neutron pairs coupled to 0+ . Excited states are first built\nfrom one broken pair (v = 2) with 2+ , 4+ , 6+ , . . ., next two broken pairs\n(v = 4) 0+ , 2+ , 3+ , 4+ , . . . and so on. To describe these spherical states in\nan IBM context, we consider the Hamiltonian (2) with a spherical structure\n[symmetry limit U(5)] and which has \u01ebreg as the only parameter. We fix this\nparameter to the 2+\n1 state of the heavier Pb isotopes A = 198 to 204, where\nthe mp-nh intruder states are high in energy and have little effect on the\nlow-excited spherical states (see fig. 1). We do not consider the one broken\npair 4+ (g boson) or 6+ (i boson),. . . states, which can only be described\nwithin extended boson models. A constant Hamiltonian for this regular\nconfiguration, \u0124reg = \u01ebreg n\u0302d , yields a constant excitation energy for the 2+\n1\nstate, independent of the number of bosons. The excitation energy of the\nobserved states, however, changes slightly with mass number A (because of\nshell effects). We choose \u01ebreg = 0.9 MeV; this value is a compromise between\na 2+\n1 state which is somewhat too low and other states that increase too\nrapidly in energy with angular momentum. A better fixing of \u01ebreg could have\nbeen obtained by a variation of \u01ebreg linear with the number of bosons. For\nthe sake of simplicity this is not done here.\n\n6\n\n\f2.2.2\n\nThe intruder excitations: 2p-2h and 4p-4h configurations\n\nThe spectroscopic information on the neutron-deficient Pb isotopes is limited. We use I-spin symmetry arguments in order to find the IBM parameters\nof the two intruder configurations in Pb from corresponding bands in neighbouring nuclei where more experimental information is available.\nBefore deriving the parameters for the 2p-2h configuration in Pb, we first\nshow in fig. 2 the correspondence between the experimental 2p-2h intruder\nband in 196 Pb-the only Pb isotope where it is known-(left panel) and the\nintruder analogue regular 0p-4h ground-state band in 192 Pt (middle panel).\nThis 0p-4h band is also shown for other Pt isotopes from mass numbers\nA = 190 to 200, where the coexisting 2p-6h intruder configuration lies high\nin energy and has little influence on the 0p-4h band. The right-hand panel of\nfig. 2 shows an IBM calculation of the 0p-4h band in the Pt isotopes which,\nusing a constant Hamiltonian\n\u0124 = \u01ebn\u0302d + \u03baQ\u0302 * Q\u0302,\n\n(10)\n\nwith Q\u0302 given in eq. (5). The band head of the \u03b3 band, the 2+\n2 level, is also\ntaken into account in order to restrict the possible parameter values. The\nparameter \u03c7 is fixed in order to reproduce the observed ratio R\nR=\n\n+\nB(E2 : 2+\n2 \u2192 01 )\n+ ,\nB(E2 : 2+\n1 \u2192 01 )\n\n(11)\n\nwhich is 0.00732 in 192 Pt [63] and 0.00485 in 194 Pt [64]. Theoretical values are\n0.00711 and 0.00500, respectively. It is seen that the experimental spectra\nfor Pb and Pt are very similar up to 6+ . Intruder spin symmetry appears\nto be a good approximation, and so it seems reasonable to use the 0p-4h\nparameters of Pt to describe the Pb intruder 2p-2h configuration.\nIn the same way we derive the parameters for the 4p-4h configuration in\nPb. In fig. 3 we show the observed analogue bands of the 4p-4h intruder\nconfiguration in the Pb isotopes (left panel), the 2p-6h intruder configuration in the Pt isotopes (second panel) and the regular 0p-8h ground-state\nconfiguration in the W isotopes (third panel). In the right-hand panel of\nfig. 3, an IBM calculation for this 0p-8h band in the W isotopes is shown,\nwith the Hamiltonian (10) again with constant parameters for all isotopes.\nThis calculation also includes the 2+\n2 level, the bandhead of the \u03b3 band. The\nparameter \u03c7 is fixed from the experimental ratio (11) in 182 W, which lies in\n7\n\n\fthe range 0.0252\u20130.0295 according to the different references in [65]; the calculated ratio is 0.0276. Again, I-spin symmetry seems to be valid in this case\nand we use the 0p-8h parameters of W to describe the 4p-4h configuration\nin Pb.\n\n2.3\n\nThree-configuration mixing in the Pb isotopes\n\nWith the three parameter sets (\u03b5i , \u03bai , \u03c7i ) determined previously for the regular, 2p-2h and 4p-4h configurations, a mixing must now be supplied that\nreproduces the experimental features of the three-configuration coexistence\nin the Pb isotopes (the extra parameters \u03b1i , \u03b2i , \u2206i ). The final set of parameters is given in table 1. In table 2, we present results on the mixing of the\nthree configurations (reg, 2p-2h and 4p-4h, respectively) in the first three\n0+ excited states. One clearly notices a rapid stabilization, close to 100%,\n+\n+\nfor the 0+\n1 state at the spherical configuration. The 02 and 03 states indicate a strong mixing between the 2p-2h and 4p-4h configurations. Rather\nquickly, a dominance of the 2p-2h configuration is observed from A = 186\n186\nup to heavier masses in the 0+\n2 state. In table 3, we identify, for 82 P b104 ,\nthe bands which contain mainly the 2p-2h (called \"2p-2h\" band) and the\n4p-4h (called \"4p-4h\" band) configuration for a particular Ji\u03c0 value. One\nnotices the \"4p-4h\" band is related to the 0+\n2 band head and follows up the\n+ + + +\n21 , 41 , 61 , 81 states, whereas the \"2p-2h\" band is connected to the 0+\n3 band\n+ + + +\nhead and follows up the 22 , 42 , 62 , 82 states, respectively. The results in\ntables 2 and 3 are particularly illuminating in showing the mixing effects\nwithin the IBM configuration mixing.\nNote that with constant parameters for all Pb isotopes identical results are\nobtained for corresponding isotopes that are symmetric around the middle\nof the shell.\nThe result of such a mixing calculation is shown in fig. 4 (left panel). From\nthe comparison with the experimental situation, see fig. 4 (right panel), the\nslope with which the intruder states gain binding energy towards midshell\nis too steep, an effect that is independent of the mixing. Apparently, I-spin\nsymmetry is not satisfied completely. A possible cause for these differences\nbetween the experimental and theoretical band structures is the fact that\nthe IBM parameters are obtained from separate calculations for the 2p-2h\nintruder excitations (fig. 2) and 4p-4h intruder excitations (fig. 3). In the\nfinal calculation for the even-even Pb nuclei, which includes the 2p-2h and\n8\n\n\f4p-4h intruder families together with the regular spherical configuration, the\nextra mixing effects will cause specific perturbations that may show up as a\nbreaking of I-spin symmetry and may also affect the A-dependence of the\nintruder band energies.\nPossible improvements can be expected from a more elaborate mixing\nstudy, treating all known data for the neutron-deficient Pb isotopes and relevant nuclei in the Z = 82, N = 126 region. A further constraint would also\nbe imposed by the condition that the lowest-lying proton 2p-2h 0+ excitations approach the observed energy at Ex \u2248 4 MeV in 208 Pb. Such extensive\ncalculations, aiming to describe besides energy spectra and band structures\nalso known electromagnetic (mostly E2 and E0) properties, isotopic and isomeric shifts and nuclear ground-state binding energies, will be pursued in the\nnear future.\nVery recently, calculations have been carried out by C. Vargas et al. [66],\nin order to determine total energy surfaces, starting from the IBM parameters\nderived in the present paper (see also table 1), using boson coherent states.\n\n3\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have explored in the present paper the possibility to describe the coexistence and mixing of three different families of excitations, corresponding\nto different intrinsic structures as observed in the Pb isotopes. In a meanfield approach the three configurations correspond to spherical, oblate and\nprolate shapes while in a shell-model description they arise as regular 0p0h states and 2p-2h and 4p-4h excitations across the Z = 82 proton shell.\nPrevious studies of such three-configuration systems were limited to the 0+\nband heads (without the associated bands) either in a mean-field [4, 42\u201344, 46]\nor an IBM [61, 62] approach, or, in 186 Pb, to a phenomenological band-mixing\ncalculation [26].\nThe present description is based on the IBM-configuration mixing approach which was originally proposed for two configurations [49\u201352]. In an\nIBM framework the three configurations are described as N-, (N + 2)- and\n(N + 4)-boson states. To reduce the number of parameters that appear\nin such a configuration mixing calculation, use is made of the concept of\nintruder-spin symmetry [55], relating configurations with different numbers\nof particle (Np ) and hole (Nh ) bosons (i.e., fermion pairs), but with a con9\n\n\fstant sum Np + Nh = N. In this way experimental excitation energies in\nadjacent Pt and W nuclei are used to fix the essential IBM parameters. The\nfinal result is a reasonably good description of the observed bands and their\nvariation with mass number A. As outlined at the end of section 2.3, ways\nto improve the present results will need extensive calculations spanning the\nregion of neutron deficient W, Os, Pt, Hg, Pb, Po and Rn nuclei as well as\nnuclei near the Z = 82, N = 126 doubly-closed shell.\nThe authors are grateful to M.
