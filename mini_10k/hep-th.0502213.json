Intro\nAnti de Sitter in three dimensions and S 3 are among the most simple and yet interesting\nstring backgrounds. They are exact solutions to the string equations beyond the supergravity approximation and, at the same time, are simple to deal with although non-trivial\nthanks to the presence of non-vanishing curvatures. For this reason they constitute an\nunique setting in which to analyze AdS/cft correspondence, black-hole physics, littlestring theory.\nString propagation in these backgrounds is described in terms of wzw models for the\nSL (2, R) and SU (2) groups, hence marginal deformations of such models allow to study\nmoduli space of the string vacua. In particular well-known class of marginal deformations\nfor wzw models are those driven by left\u2013right current bilinears [1, 2]. On the other hand\nS 3 and AdS3 are embedded in larger structures so one can consider marginal deformations\nwhere just one of the currents belongs to the SU (2) or AdS3 algebra, the other belonging\nto some other U (1) corresponding to an internal magnetic or electric field.\nThis kind of deformation generates a continuous line of exact cft's. In this note we\nwill show how with an appropriate choice for the deforming current we obtain a boundary\nin moduli space and that this boundary can be given a simple geometric interpretation\n[3, 4] in terms of the AdS2 \u00d7 S 2 near-horizon geometry of the Bertotti-Robinson black hole\n[5, 6].\n\n2. SU (2) asymmetric deformation\nIn the SU (2) case, there exists just one possible choice for the deforming current the two\nother being related by inner automorphisms, since the group has rank one, is compact and\nits Lie algebra simple. Take the wzw model for SU (2):\nSSU (2)k\n\n1\n=\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nd2 z\n\n(\n\n3\n\u0001 X\nk\n \u0304 a\n \u0304\n \u0304\n \u0304\n \u0304\n\u03c8 a \u2202\u03c8\n\u2202\u03b1\u2202\u03b1 + \u2202\u03b2 \u2202\u03b2 + \u2202\u03b3 \u2202\u03b3 + 2 cos \u03b2 \u2202\u03b1\u2202\u03b3 +\n4\na=1\n\n)\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere \u03c8 a are the left-moving free fermions, superpartners of the bosonic SU (2)k currents,\nand (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) are the usual Euler angles parameterizing the SU (2) group manifold. The\nleft-moving fermions transform in the adjoint of SU (2); there are no right-moving superpartners but a right-moving current algebra of total charge c = 16 can be realized in terms\nof right-moving free fermions. This means that we can build a N = (1, 0) world-sheet\nsupersymmetry-compatible deformation given by:\n\u03b4Smagnetic =\n\n\u221a\n\nkkG H\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u0001\nd2 z J 3 + \u0131\u03c8 1 \u03c8 2 J \u0304G ;\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere J 3 belongs to the SU (2) algebra and J \u0304g is the current of the algebra at level kg\nrealized by the right-moving free fermions. An exact cft is obtained for any value of the\ndeformation parameter H.\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\f2.1 Geometry\nThese new backgrounds all present a constant dilaton, a magnetic field, a ns-ns field\nproportional to the unperturbed one and a metric retaining a residual SU (2) \u00d7 U (1)\nisometry [7]. The most remarkable property is that the deformation line in moduli space\nhas a boundary corresponding to a critical value of the deformation parameter H 2 = 1/2.\nAt this point the U (1) subgroup decompactifies and the resulting geometry is the left coset\nSU (2) /U (1) \u223c S 2 which is thus found to be an exact cft background only supported\nby a magnetic field (the dilaton remains constant and ns field vanishes). A geometrical\ninterpretation for this process can be given as follows: the initial S 3 sphere is a Hopf\nfibration of an S 1 fiber generated by the J 3 current over an S 2 base; the deformation only\nacts on the fiber, changing its radius up to the point where this seems to vanish, actually\nmarking the trivialization of the fibration:\nS 3 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 R \u00d7 S 2 ,\n\n(2.3)\n\n2\nH 2 \u2192Hmax\n\nIf we turn our attention to the gauge field one can show that a quantization of the\nmagnetic charge is only compatible with levels of the affine algebras such that kkG = p2 , p \u2208\nZ. We will find the same condition in terms of the partition function for the boundary\ndeformation.\nAlthough this construction has been implicitly carried on for first order in \u03b1\u2032 background fields, it is important to stress that the resulting metric is nevertheless exact at all\norders since the renormalization boils down to the redefinition of the level k that is simply\nshifted by the dual Coxeter number (just as in the wzw case).\n2.2 Partition Function\nConsider the case of kg = 2 (one right-moving C fermion). The relevant components\nof the initial partition funciton are given by a SU (2)k\u22122 -modular-invariance-compatible\ncombination of SU (2)k\u22122 supersymmetric characters and fermions from the gauge sector.\nFor our pourposes it is useful to further decompose the supersymmetric SU (2)k characters\nin terms of those of the N = 2 minimal models:\n\u0013\n\u0014 \u0015\n\u0014 \u0015\n\u0012\nX\na\n2\u03bd\nj a\n.\n(2.4)\nCm\n\u03c7j (\u03c4 ) \u03b8\n\u0398m,k \u03c4, \u2212\n(\u03c4, \u03bd) =\nk\nb\nb\nm\u2208Z2k\n\nThe deformation acts as a boost on the left-lattice contribution of the Cartan current of\nthe supersymmetric SU (2)k and on the right current from the gauge sector:\n\u0398m,k\n\n\u0014 \u0015 X\n\u0010\u221a\n\u00112\n1\nh 2\n1\nh\n2kn+ \u221am\n\u2212\u0131\u03c0g (n\u0304+ h\n)\n2\n2k\n2\n\u03b8\u0304\n=\ne\nq\nq\u0304 2 (n\u0304+ 2 )\ng\nn,n\u0304\n\u2212\u2192\n\nX\nn,n\u0304\n\n\u2212\u0131\u03c0g (n\u0304+ h\n2)\n\ne\n\nq\n\n1\n2\n\nh\u0010 \u221a\n\n2kn+ \u221am\n\n2k\n\n\u00d7 q\u0304\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n1\n2\n\n\u0011\n\nh\n\nsinh x\ncosh x+(n\u0304+ h\n2)\n\n(n\u0304+ h2 ) cosh x+\n\n\u0010\u221a\n\ni2\n\n2kn+ \u221am\n\n2k\n\n\u0011\n\nsinh x\n\ni2\n\n, (2.5)\n\n\f1\nwhere the boost parameter x is given by cosh x = 1\u22122H\n2.\nAlthough an exact cft is obtained for any value of the deformation parameter H\nwe will concentrate, as before, on the boundary value H 2 = 1/2. In this case the boost\n\u221a\n\u221a\nparameter diverges thus giving the following constraints: 4(k +2)n+2m+2 2kn\u0304+ 2kh =\n0. Therefore, the limit is well-defined only if the level of the supersymmetric SU (2)k satisfies\nthe quantization condition k = 2p2 , p \u2208 Z i.e. the charge quantization for the flux of the\ngauge field. Under these constraints the U (1) corresponding to the combination of charges\northogonal our condition decouples and can be removed. In this way we end up with the\nexpression for the S 2 partition function:\n\u0014\n\u0015 X\n\u0014 \u0015\nX\na; h\na \uf6be\u0304\n\u0131\u03c0g (N + h2 ) j\nj\uf6be\u0304\ne\nZS 2\n=\nM\nCp(2N \u2212h)\n\u03c7\u0304\n(2.6)\nb; g\nb\nj,\uf6be\u0304\n\nN \u2208Z2p\n\nin agreement with the result found in [8] by using the coset construction. The remaining\ncharge N labels the magnetic charge of the state under consideration.\n\n3. SL (2, R) deformation\nThe same construction as above can be repeated for the SL (2, R) wzw model. In this case\nthe moduli space is somewhat richer for it is possible to realize three different asymmetric\ndeformations using the three generators of the group. These are not equivalent (SL (2, R)\nis not compact) and in fact they lead to three physically different backgrounds. The elliptic\ndeformation line, in example, contains the G\u00f6del universe [9], the parabolic deformation\ngives the superposition of AdS3 and a gravitational plane wave. Two of these deformation\nlines present the same boundary effect as the SU (2) deformation. In particular the elliptic\ndeformation leads to the hyperbolic space H2 = SL (2, R) /U (1) supported by an immaginary magnetic field, ie an exact but non-unitary cft. The hyperbolic deformation, on\nthe other hand, leads to AdS2 = SL (2, R) /U (1) supported by an electric field. No charge\nquantization is present in this case, because of the non-compact nature of the background.\nIn this latter case it is not yet possible to give the same construction for the partition\nfunction as for the SU (2) case since this would require the decomposition of the initial\npartition function in a basis of hyperbolic characters which is not a simple exercize. Nevertheless by following the same procedure as before it is possible to evaluate the effect of the\ndeformation on the spectrum of primaries and hence give the resulting AdS2 background\nspectrum.\n\n4. AdS2 \u00d7 S 2\nThe S 2 and AdS2 backgrounds can be combined so to give an exact cft corresponding to\nthe AdS2 \u00d7 S 2 near-horizon geometry of the br black-hole.\nLet us now consider the complete heterotic string background which consists of the\nAdS2 \u00d7 S 2 space\u2013time times an N = 2 internal conformal field theory M, that we will\nassume to be of central charge \u0109 = 6 and with integral R-charges. The levels k of SU (2)\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fand k\u0302 of SL(2, R) are such that the string background is critical:\n\u0109 =\n\n2(k \u2212 2) 2(k\u0302 + 2)\n+\n= 4 =\u21d2 k = k\u0302.\nk\nk\u0302\n\n(4.1)\n\nThis translates into the equality of the radii of the corresponding S 2 and AdS2 factors,\nwhich is in turn necessary for supersymmetry. Furthermore, the charge quantization condition for the two-sphere restricts further the level to k = 2p2 , p \u2208 N.\nThe combined AdS2 \u00d7 S 2 background can give new insights about the physics of the\nbr black hole in particular by analizing the Schwinger-pair production in such background,\nor the study of the stability and propagation of D-branes.\n\nAcknowledgments\nResearch partially supported by the EEC under the contracts HPRN-CT-2000-00131,\nHPRN-CT-2000-00148, MEXT-CT-2003-509661, MRTN-CT-2004-005104 and MRTN-CT2004-503369.\n\nReferences\n[1] S.
