Introduction\nType-I X-ray bursts, or X-ray bursts in short, result from thermonuclear shell flashes of hydrogen and helium on neutron stars\n(NSs). The fuel is accreted from a Roche-lobe-filling companion\nstar. As the accretion of this material progresses, the pressure at\nthe bottom of the accreted layer rises to ignition conditions for\nthermonuclear fusion processes like the (hot, \u03b2-decay limited)\nCNO cycle, triple-\u03b1 process, \u03b1-proton capture and the (\u03b2-decay\nlimited) rapid-proton capture (rp) process. In general, the fuel is\nburnt within 1 s in the top few meters of the NS and temperatures\nmomentarily reach values as high as a few GK. The layer is covered by a non-burning layer, on top of which is the photosphere.\nWhat one measures is the cooling flux passing through the photosphere, with temperatures peaking at about 30 MK. The burst\nduration is primarily determined by the time it takes to cool the\nshell. For H-rich flashes, the duration is further lengthened due\nto prolonged nuclear burning through the rp process. The burst\nduration may range from a few seconds to a few hundred seconds for the large majority of X-ray bursts. Exceptional durations come from very thick helium layers on relatively cold NSs\nin hydrogen-poor ultracompact X-ray binaries (i.e., up to thousands of seconds; e.g., in 't Zand et al. 2005; Cumming et al.\n2006; in 't Zand et al. 2007) and flashes of very thick carbon\nshells ('superbursts'; e.g., Cornelisse et al. 2000; Cumming &\nBildsten 2001; Strohmayer & Brown 2002). For reviews on Xray bursts and further references, we refer to Lewin et al. (1993),\nBildsten (1998) and Strohmayer & Bildsten (2006).\nSometimes very long tails are seen in X-ray bursts that\nare not related to the aforementioned long bursts. For instance,\nChenevez et al. (2006) discuss a peculiar burst from GX 3+1.\nSend offprint requests to: J.J.M. in 't Zand, email jeanz@sron.nl\n\nSince the advent of X-ray astronomy, about 100 bursts have been\ndetected from this source (e.g., den Hartog et al. 2003) and all are\nshorter than a few tens of seconds except for this peculiar burst. It\nhas a prolonged tail that starts at about 25% of the ordinary burst\npeak flux and decays with an e-folding decay time of 1110 s (for\nphotons between 3 and 6 keV). Chenevez et al. (2006) hypothesize that the tail is due to rp capture of a rich hydrogen mixture\nthat became available after the accretion rate dropped below the\nthreshold where hydrogen is burnt in a stable manner (GX 3+1\nwas in a 10-yr minimum at about the time of the burst). However,\nthe time scales of the slowest \u03b2 decays expected in X-ray bursts\nare at least one order of magnitude shorter than 1110 s (e.g.,\nFisker et al. 2008). A few similar cases (i.e., from systems that\nare clearly not ultracompact X-ray binaries) are described in the\nliterature, most notably in Czerny et al. (1987) and Gotthelf &\nKulkarni (1997). There is a clear duality in the time profile of\nthese bursts: they start with an ordinary short-lived burst, followed by a 102\u22123 s long tail without an unambiguous cooling\nsignature. The long tail starts off quite brightly in these bursts, at\na few tens of percents of the burst peak flux. Since the nature of\nthese long tails is not well established, it is worthwhile exploring\nwhether there are long tails that start off at a lower fraction of the\nburst peak (i.e., percents instead of tens of percents).\nBurst studies usually concentrate on the brightest parts,\nroughly above 1% of the peak flux (which is often close to the\nEddington limit, see Galloway et al. 2008), and for a good reason. Most bursts come from prolific bursters with mass accretion\nrates above the same 1% level. Since accretion is notoriously\nvariable, this makes disentangling burst radiation from accretion\nradiation difficult at fluxes below 1% of the Eddington limit.\nExceptions are bursts from NSs that accrete at rates below\n1% of the Eddington limit. This pertains to most persistently ac-\n\n\f2\n\nJ.J.M. in 't Zand, L. Keek, A. Cumming et al.: Long tails on thermonuclear X-ray bursts\n\ncreting ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs; a nice example of\na burst that could be studied with Swift to very deep levels originates in A 1246-588; in 't Zand et al. 2008) and bursts from transients whose accretion rate has dwindled down to low but nonzero values (e.g., in 't Zand et al. 2003). These exceptions show\ntails that are natural extensions of the decays of the bright parts\nof the same X-ray bursts. In other words: there is no prompt/tail\nduality.\nDespite the fact that it is difficult to study bursts at sub1% levels in fast-accreting bursters, the situation is sometimes\nnot desperate. This paper presents a study of the unique burster\nGS 1826-24. The accretion is very stable in this source. The variability on a time scale of the burst recurrence time (few hours) is\nabout 2% rms, so that the recurrence time from burst to burst is\nrelatively stable as are the burst peak flux and profile (Ubertini\net al. 1999; Cocchi et al. 2001; Galloway et al. 2004; Heger\net al. 2007). This behavior earned it nicknames such as 'the\nclocked burster' (Ubertini et al. 1999) and 'the textbook burster'\n(Bildsten 2000). GS 1826-24 is also notable for a high-energy\ncomponent of the burst emission (i.e., above 30 keV where negigible amounts of black body emission are expected; in 't Zand\net al. 1999). Because of its stable bursting behavior and accretion\nrate, GS 1826-24 is excellently suited for low-level burst flux\nstudies. The most recent distance determination is 6.07\u00b10.18 kpc\n(for isotropic burst radiation; Heger et al. 2007).\nThe existence of long tails in GS 1826-24 was already implied in in 't Zand et al. (1999) and Thompson et al. (2005).\nThe latter work concentrated on the persistent spectrum as measured with Chandra and RXTE. This emission could be successfully modeled by a combination of two comptonization components (see also Thompson et al. 2008) due to the presence of hot\nplasmas in the immediate neighborhood of the NS. Bursts were\nstudied as well, and their spectra could be modeled by a black\nbody component plus the variation of one of the persistent comptonization components. This is in line with the high-energy burst\nemission seen by in 't Zand et al. (1999) and in contrast with the\nso-called 'standard' modeling of burst spectra where the burst\nemission is modeled solely by one black body component and\nthe persistent spectrum is unaffected by the burst emission. A\nsimple physical interpretation of the change of one comptonization component would be that a hot plasma up-scatters some of\nthe burst thermal photons to higher energies and itself is cooled\ndown by the soft photons. This model was applied to 1000 s of\nburst data in Thompson et al. (2005). The final 850 s of the data\nwere modeled by comptonization only.\nIn this paper we make a study of the long tail in GS 182624 employing all RXTE data available and cross checking with\nXMM-Newton data. Thus, we obtain a superior statistical quality and are able to probe the tail longer than Thompson et al.\n(2005). We supplement this analysis with briefer investigations\nof two other prolific bursters, EXO 0748-676 and 4U 1728-34.\nWe propose an explanation for the tail.\n\n2. Observations\nWe use data from the Proportional Counter Array (PCA) on the\nRossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) and the European Photon\nImaging p-n junction camera (EPIC-pn) on the XMM-Newton\nobservatory.

There are no other bright X-ray sources in the field\naround GS 1826-24.\nRXTE is particularly suited for the study of low-mass X-ray\nbinaries, and since its 1995 launch has accumulated unprecedented exposure times on many X-ray bursters, one of them\nbeing GS 1826-24. Galloway et al. (2008) compiled a catalog of all bursts detected between Feb 8, 1996, and June 3,\n2007. The total PCA exposure time on GS 1826-24 over 127\nobservations in this time frame is 929 ks. 65 bursts were detected between Nov 5, 1997, and March 10, 2007, and the mean\nburst rate was 0.25 hr\u22121 . None of the bursts exhibit evidence\nfor photospheric radius expansion, so that the peak luminosity must have been below the Eddington limit. The bolometric absorption-corrected peak flux ranged between 23.5 \u00b1 0.8\nand (29.6 \u00b1 0.8) \u00d7 10\u22129 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 and the fluence between\n0.923 \u00b1 0.016 and (1.059 \u00b1 0.004) \u00d7 10\u22126 erg cm\u22122 (Galloway\net al. 2008). The decay can be modeled by two subsequent exponential decays. The e-folding decay times ranged between 12.9\nand 23.3 s for the first decay and between 40.5 and 57.2 s for\n\n\fJ.J.M. in 't Zand, L.

(2007). Nine X-ray bursts were detected in the first and\nseven in the second observation. The final bursts in each observation suffered from high background levels and were excluded\nfrom the analysis. All X-ray detectors were on, but we concentrate on the 0.1-12 keV EPIC-pn measurements because that instrument (Str\u00fcder et al. 2001) is by far the most sensitive for\nour analysis. It has an effective area that ranges between 10003000 cm2 for 0.5-2 keV and 900 cm2 at 2-6 keV. The spectral resolution is 2.5% (FWHM) at 6 keV. The instrument was switched\nto Fast Timing mode, implying that the central CCD (of the 12\navailable), encompassing 13.\u2032 6\u00d74.\u20324 of the field of view, is read\nout 1-dimensionally (along the 4.\u2032 4 side) at a 1.5 ms resolution.\nSource photons were extracted between RAWX values of 30 and\n45, with pixel patterns below 5 and grade 0; background photons were extracted between RAWX=10 and 25. We refer to Kong\net al. (2007) for further details, noting that SAS version 7.1.0\nwas employed for our data analysis.\n\n3. Data analysis\nWe selected 29 out of the 65 PCA-detected bursts that have data\navailable between 4000 and 1000 s before the burst start and\nbetween 400 and 3000 s afterwards, see Table 1. The pre-burst\ninterval was based on the general trend that the flux was lowest\nthere and should provide the best estimate of the accretion flux.\nWe processed the data of the 29 bursts to an average light curve\nas follows. Taking the 'standard-products' light curves as starting point (these are data from PCU2 in 5 energy bands, corrected\nfor particle-induced background and with a resolution of 16 s)\nwe determined the pre-burst flux level from data between 4000\nand 1000 s prior to the burst (note that data gaps are common in\nthis 3000 s time frame), subtracted that from all flux measurements, co-aligned the data at the start time of the burst (defined\nas the time when the photon flux exceeds 25% of the peak flux;\n\n100\n\n200\n\n500\n\n1000\nTime [sec]\n\n2000\n\n5000\n\nFig. 2.

Figure 1 shows\nthe resulting profiles in 2 to 4 and 4 to 9 keV, normalized to the\npeak flux. Apart from the well-known burst profile with a duration of about 400 s, it shows the striking appearance of an additional burst component that lasts approximately ten times longer\nat flux levels between 10\u22123 and 10\u22122 times the burst peak value.\nA comparison with higher time-resolution data shows that the\naveraging of the peak in 16 s time bins lowers the peak flux by\napproximately a factor of 2. While the initial decay of the profile\nshows the classical cooling of the bursts (the high-energy flux\ndecaying faster than the low-energy flux), the slow decay does\nnot show obvious cooling.\n\n\f4\n\nJ.J.M. in 't Zand, L.

The model consists of a black body and power-law\ncomponent absorbed by a fixed column of NH = 3.1 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 . The\npanels show from top to bottom: the bolometric flux for the black body\ncomponent (solid curve) and the unabsorbed 3-20 keV flux found for\nthe power-law component (dashed curve; gaps indicate times when the\npower law is not detected), the black body temperature, the emission\narea in terms of the radius of a sphere at a canonical distance of 10 kpc,\nand the goodness-of-fit in terms of reduced \u03c72 (the number of degrees\nof freedom is 17 or 18). The black body temperature is, beyond 150 s,\nfixed to the values found in the XMM-Newton data.\n\nThe data can be described satisfactorily by an exponential\ndecay function between 600 and 5500 s. For the 2-9 keV time\nprofile the fit is shown in Fig. 2. the decay time is 1252 \u00b1 25 s\n(\u03c72 /\u03bd = 16.9/13). Resolved in the two bands the e-folding decay\ntimes are 1261\u00b129 s in 2-4 keV (\u03c72 /\u03bd = 16.3/10) and 1381\u00b129\nin 4-9 keV (as measured between 600 and 3500 s after burst\nonset for lack of statistics beyond 3500 s; \u03c72 /\u03bd = 53.4/10). Since\nit is expected that cooling by thermal/photon diffusion follows\na power law (Eichler & Cheng 1989a) we fitted such a law and\nfind, between 300 and 2300 s, a power law index of \u22120.93\u00b10.02.\nWe sought verification of the long tail in data from the\nXMM-Newton observations. Figure 3 shows the 2-9 keV light\ncurve, averaged over 14 out of the 16 X-ray bursts (leaving out\nthe last burst of each observation, being compromised by increased background levels). The same long tail is seen as with\n\nFig. 5. Modeling results for time-resolved 0.7-10 keV burst spectra of\n14 bursts detected XMM-Newton observation. Spectral channels were\nbinned so that each bin contains at least 15 photons. The number of\ndegrees of freedom ranges between roughly 500 and 2000 (for 2 spectra,\none for each observation) which explains the small scatter in \u03c72\u03bd . The\nanomalous values at 20 s are due to data drop outs due to full data\nbuffers from high photon rates (see Kong et al. 2007).\n\nRXTE. The e-folding decay time is \u03c4 = 1006 \u00b1 26 s between\n600 and 2400 s which is similar as for the RXTE curve. A tail is\nalso seen in data below 2 keV, but the statistics are not so good\nto reveal it beyond 103 s. The e-folding decay time in this lowenergy bandpass is 524 \u00b1 172 s between 400 and 1000 s, which\nat least shows that it is not longer than for the 2-9 keV band.\nWe performed time-resolved spectroscopy. Spectra were accumulated for 17 bursts that have small off-axis angles in the\nPCA and have identical detector-voltage settings (i.e., they are\nsaid to be in the same 'gain epoch'; see specification in Table 1).\nOnly PCU2 data were employed to obtain a homogeneous data\nset. The time resolution of the spectral extraction was chosen\nto vary between 1 s early on in the burst and 200 s at the end.\nEach burst was divided in 72 time bins that are identical with\nrespect to the burst start times. Spectra were extracted from\nevent mode data with s/w tool seextrct for these time intervals\nand corrected for the particle-induced background as determined\nwith pcabackest in the same time interval.

Subsequently the spectra for all 17\nbursts were averaged in their respective time frames, and the average pre-burst spectrum was subtracted from the 72 burst spectra. These spectra were, between 4 and 20 keV, modeled with\na simple absorbed black body function, employing a fixed absorption column of NH = 3.1 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 (see XMM-Newton\nanalysis below). The photo-absorption cross sections were taken\nfrom Ba\u0142ucinska-Church & McCammon (1992) and the composition of the absorbing material from Wilms et al. (2000). About\nhalf of the spectra (in the brightest phase) turn out not to be consistent with this model and an additional power-law component\nwith a fixed index (equal to that of the pre-burst data) was included in the model. The fitted values for the various black body\nparameters are shown in Fig. 4. All time intervals are well fitted. During the first 100 s the black body parameters are as expected for an X-ray burst: a temperature peaking at an equivalent\nof 2.3 keV and gradually decreasing after that, and an emission\narea that remains approximately constant after the rise phase.\nHowever, after 100 s the picture changes: the inferred emission\narea decreases sharply by at least an order of magnitude. The\nbolometric unabsorbed fluence in the 300-1500 s time frame is\n3.4\u00d710\u22128 erg cm\u22122 . This is about 3% of the fluence in the prompt\nburst (Galloway et al. 2008).\nA similar time-resolved spectral analysis was performed\nXMM-Newton data from the 14 low-background bursts, except\nthat this involves an analysis of 0.7-10 keV photons and channels were binned to make sure that the number of photons per\nbin was in excess of 15 to ensure applicability of the \u03c72 statistic (such a procedure was not necessary for the RXTE data).\nPrior to the burst spectral modeling we modeled the pre-burst\ndata to find NH and the photon index to apply to the burst data.\nThese are NH = 3.1 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 and \u0393 = 1.47 (\u03c72\u03bd = 1.001 for\n\u03bd = 2923 over two spectra, for a systematic uncertainty per bin\nof 2%). The results of the burst spectra modeling (Fig. 5) are\ngenerally consistent with the RXTE results, except at the start\nand at the end of tail (beyond about 1000 s after burst onset)\nwhere a comparison becomes difficult because of statistical issues. This shows that the drop in radius at 100 s as seen with\nRXTE is not related to the lack of low-energy coverage of that\ninstrument since it is also seen with XMM-Newton for which the\nbandpass is extended with the 0.7-4.0 keV photon energy range.\n\nFig. 7. Modeling results for time-resolved PCA burst spectra of average\nof 36 bursts from 4U 1728-34. The model consists of a black body\nand power-law component absorbed by a fixed column of NH = 2.6 \u00d7\n1022 cm\u22122 . The panels show from top to bottom: the bolometric flux for\nthe black body component, the black body temperature, the emission\narea in terms of the radius of a sphere at a canonical distance of 10\nkpc, and the goodness-of-fit. The data points beyond 250 s have large\n\u03c72 values (outside range of bottom plot) and do not fit the model. This\nis most likely due to variability in accretion flux.\n\nWe studied the timing properties of the tail in comparison to\nthose of the pre-burst data. Fourier power density spectra were\ngenerated of data in the pre-burst -4000/-1000 s time frame and\nin the tail +1000/+3000 s time frame. Event mode data were employed at a time resolution of 2\u221211 s (roughly 0.5 ms), as long as\nthey were available (see Table 1). Power spectra were made in\n1968 8-s data stretches for the pre-burst data and averaged, and\nfor 2574 8-s data stretches in the tail data and averaged. Out of\nthe FTOOL package vs 6.5, powspec was employed for this purpose. The relative difference between these two average power\nspectra is presented in Fig. 6. There is no difference between\nboth spectra, indicating that nothing significantly changed in the\naccretion stream between these periods.\n\n4. Other bursters\nWe checked the average burst profiles of other known prolific\nbursters in the PCA data archive, employing the RXTE bursts\n\n\f6\n\nJ.J.M. in 't Zand, L. Keek, A. Cumming et al.: Long tails on thermonuclear X-ray bursts\n\ncatalog (Galloway et al. 2008). Most of these have variable accretion fluxes and are, therefore, difficult to analyze for the reasons discussed in the introduction. Nevertheless, they sometimes\nindicate long tails, although never as long as in GS 1826-24. In\nthis section we report briefly two cases.\n\n60\n\nEXO 0748\u2212676 / PCUs 0+2+3 / 16 s bins / Channels 1\u221213\n\n4.2. EXO 0748-676\n\nEXO 0748-676 is well known for the accretion-disk edge-on line\nof sight, causing eclipses and dips every orbital period of 3.8\nhr (Parmar et al. 1986), and also for exhibiting very short burst\nrecurrence times in certain accretion rate regimes. Boirin et al.\n(2007) discovered with XMM-Newton that there are times when\nthis source exhibits 3 bursts in a row within only half an hour.\nThe first burst in such a 'triplet' always shows a longer tail than\nthe subsequent bursts. In the average burst profiles the e-folding\ndecay time is about 2.5 times longer for the first bursts than for\nthe subsequent bursts (50-55 s versus 14-19 s).\nRXTE observed EXO 0748-676 ninety-four times for a\ntotal exposure of 1.39 Ms. Eighty-four bursts were detected.\nHowever, many of these observations were concentrated on\ncatching eclipses and, thus, involve only small time stretches\nrendering burst tail studies impossible. Also, the bursts are rather\nweak so that multiple PCUs are needed to perform meaningful\n\n50\n40\n\n4U 1728-34 was observed 346 times for a total PCA exposure\ntime of 1.94 Ms and a total of 106 bursts were detected; a large\nportion of these, 69, show photospheric radius expansion. All\nbursts are short and have time scales between 4.4 and 8.7 s\n(Galloway et al. 2008). 40 bursts have good coverage and are\nnot within too wild accretion flux variations to search for a tail. It\nturns out that the average profile of these bursts extends to about\n800 s which is 102 times longer than the initial burst phase. The\nexponential decay times are 477\u00b180 s for 2-4 keV, 314\u00b126 s for\n4-9 keV (between 300 and 800 s) and 306\u00b112 s for 2-9 keV. A\npower-law fit to the tail in the latter bandpass between 100 and\n800 s yields a decay index of 1.17 \u00b1 0.02.\nWe performed time-resolved spectroscopy in a similar manner as for GS 1826-24 (i.e., the persistent flux as determined\nfrom pre-burst data was subtracted prior to the spectral modelling). There was no need to include a power law. 36 bursts\nwere selected for this procedure and only PCU2 data were employed. Since there is no majority within one RXTE PCA gain\nepoch, we employed bursts from epochs 3a, 3b, 4 and 5, averaged them per gain epoch, modeled per gain epoch and averaged\nthe fitted parameters over the epochs per time bin. A warning\nis appropriate here: the bursts in 4U 1728-34 vary more than in\nGS 1826-24; averaging them will smooth out short features. The\nresults yield the profiles in Fig. 7 (\u03c72\u03bd was averaged as well; although that number does not adhere to \u03c72 statistical properties,\nit does give a sense of the overall quality of the fit per bin). The\nbolometric flux can be followed downward over 3 decades. It\nhas a smoother evolution than for GS 1826-24, possibly because\nthe Eddington limit is reached for most bursts so that the flux\nflattens against a ceiling representing that limit. Furthermore noticeable is the drop in radius beyond 10 s, a similar effect as seen\nin GS 1826-24 beyond 100 s. The fluence of the tail is 9% of that\nof the prompt emission, taking 100 s as the boundary between\nprompt burst and burst tail.

The\nhorizontal line is plotted as a reference for the out-of-burst flux.\n\nanalyses. Rather, we employ XMM-Newton data to determine\naverage burst profiles. EXO 0748-676 is the burster which, with\nXMM-Newton, was most intensely observed. In 158 hr of exposure investigated by Boirin et al. (2007) there are 33 singlet\nbursts detected, next to 14 doublets and 5 triplets. We determined average time profiles of 31 singlets that are not affected\nby eclipses or dips within 2000 s, in the same bandpasses as\nfor the RXTE data for GS 1826-24 and 4U 1728-34. These also\nshow a long tail. The exponential decay times are 266 \u00b1 122 s\nand 260 \u00b1 120 s for 2-4 and 4-9 keV respectively. Again no clear\ncooling is observed in this tail. The equivalent power-law decay\nindex is 2.1 \u00b1 0.8 for 2-4 keV and 1.6 \u00b1 0.8 for 4-9 keV.\nRXTE data do show at least one interesting burst. It is a burst\ntriplet that occurred on September 12, 2006 (onset of first burst at\n16:30:36 UT). The light curve, as extracted from standard 2 data\nin ObsID 92013-01-03-000, is presented in Fig. 8. Standard-2\ndata from PCUs 0, 2 and 3 were added within 2.0-7.3 keV and\nthe time resolution of these data is 16 s. The results of timeresolved spectroscopy are shown in Fig. 9. The unabsorbed bolometric fluence ratio over the 3 bursts is 5 : 1 : 1/10 (for the first\nburst accumulating fluence over only the first 300 s, so excluding\nthe long tail). The light curve clearly shows a long tail to the first\nburst. The e-folding decay time is 300 \u00b1 42 s (measured between\n400 and 1200 s after burst onset and excluding the prompt flux\nof the 2nd burst). This is similar as found in the average XMMNewton burst profile. The fluence in the tail, excluding the three\nbursts, is 4.5\u00d710\u22129 erg cm\u22122 which is 1.2 \u00b1 0.1% of the prompt\nemission from the first burst (taking 300 s as the boundary between both). It is interesting to note that, in the bolometric flux,\nthere is no clear boundary between the long tail in this triple\nburst and the prompt burst, in the sense that there is no excess of\nthe early emission above the backward extrapolation of the tail.\nThis is contrast to the situation for GS 1826-24 (cf., Fig. 4 top\npanel). The same applies to 4U 1728-34 (Fig. 7).\nWhat is most remarkable about this long tail is that it is seemingly unaffected by the occurrence of the second burst. The tail\nprogresses undisturbed along the same decay curve. This suggests that the first burst and its tail emission have a different ori-\n\n\fJ.J.M. in 't Zand, L. Keek, A.

If the tail would be proportionally smaller, the\nstatistical significance of it will have dropped below the detection threshold.\n\n5. Discussion\nOur measurements are summarized in Table 2. We find that Xray bursts from GS 1826-24 show a long tail. In other words,\nthey exhibit a dual time profile with a prompt burst phase lasting\na few hundred seconds and a tail phase with an e-folding decay\ntime of 103 s, a flux level of less than \u22481% of the peak flux and\na fluence that is 3% of that of prompt burst. Beyond the first\n200 s the spectrum can be modeled by a black body with a very\nslowly decreasing temperature of \u22480.9 keV and a strongly decreasing emission area. We find similar tails in RXTE data of 4U\n1728-34 and RXTE and XMM-Newton data of EXO 0748-676,\nalthough the contrast between prompt and tail phase is less pronounced in those cases. Generally the detection of tails is diffi-\n\ncult because of confusion with variable accretion radiation. Still,\nbright pronounced tails have been reported in the literature for a\nfew individual bursts. The two most obvious questions about the\nlong tails are: what is the physical cause and why is hardly any\ncooling detected? We investigate the first question in Sect. 5.1,\nkeeping in mind only GS 1826-24. In Sect. 5.2 we touch on the\nsecond question, considering 4U 1728-34 and EXO 0748-676 as\nwell. In Sect. 5.3 we compare GS 1826-24 with the other cases\nlisted in Table 2.\n5.1. Origin of the long tail\n\nWhat is the origin of the 103 s time scale of the long tail? One\nidea spawns from the detection of a hot plasma surrounding\nthe NS (Thompson et al. 2005), namely that prompt burst photons are trapped in the hot plasma through scattering and that\nthe 103 s time scale is the time it takes to drain the plasma of\nthose photons. The maximum size of the plasma in a 2.1 hr orbit\n(Homer et al. 1998) is of order 1011 cm. For an optical depth of 6\n(Thompson et al. 2005), this implies a drainage time of at most\n10-102 s. This is one to two orders of magnitude shorter than\nobserved. Therefore, if 2.1 hr is indeed the orbital period (this\nneeds to be verified; e.g., Mescheryakov et al. 2004), the 103 s\ntime scale cannot be explained by this idea.\nAnother idea is that the tail is due to cooling of layers that\nare deeper than the flash layer. In a thermonuclear shell flash,\nheat is transported upward (to be radiated by the photosphere) as\nwell as downward (heating up deeper layers through conduction;\nEichler & Cheng 1989b; Strohmayer & Brown 2002). Deeper\nlayers, extending down to the crust, consist of the ashes of the\n\n\f8\n\nJ.J.M. in 't Zand, L. Keek, A. Cumming et al.: Long tails on thermonuclear X-ray bursts\n\nTable 2.

Radiative cooling of these deeper layers can explain the\nlong tail. The time scale of the long tail points to a column depth\nthat is 10 to 30 times larger than that of the burning layer. The\namount of fluence in the tail is one to two orders of magnitude\nsmaller than in the prompt burst, suggesting less heating downward than upward.\nThe idea that the long tail results from cooling of deeper layers is corroborated by model calculations. Heger et al. (2007)\ncalculated various sequences of flashes specifically for GS 182624 with different mass accretion rates and metallicities. Their\nmodel 'A3' is the one whose recurrence time of 3.85 hr matches\nbest the majority of our bursts. This model assumes a mass accretion rate of 1.58\u00d710\u22129 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (or 1\u00d71017 g s\u22121 ) and a metallicity of Z = 0.02. The long-term time profile of the radiated\nluminosity is very similar to Fig. 27 of Woosley et al. (2004).\nIgnoring the period before the first burst and after the accretion\nturn-on, the interburst time profile is characterized by a gradual decline till about 3000 s after the burst onset followed by a\ngradual increase for about 104 s untill the next burst. The decline\nis due to cooling of the deeper layers; the increase is due to hot\nCNO burning of newly accreted hydrogen in the burning zone. In\nFig. 10 we plot the observed bolometric flux (see also Fig. 4) and\nthe average luminosity profile of 29 bursts from the 'A3' model\nby Heger et al. (2007). The fluxes and luminosities were normalized to the peak value, and the light curves were aligned at the\npeak. Times in the model were corrected for general relativistic\neffects (through a multiplication with 1+z = 1.26; Woosley et al.\n2004). The time profiles are an excellent match, all the way to\nthe long tail. Figure 11 shows for this model the evolution of the\ndepth profiles of temperature, net outward luminosity and nuclear energy generation rate per unit mass. Figure 12 presents\na more detailed view of the latter panel, showing the dynamic\ndepth profile of the specific nuclear energy generation rate, annotated with the various nuclear processes playing a dominant\n\nrole at the various locations. Most of the nuclear burning occurs\nfor column depths y < 2 \u00d7 108 g cm\u22122 , but layers are heated that\nare 10 times deeper (see first panel of Fig. 11). The energetically\nless important nuclear burning below 2 \u00d7 108 g cm\u22122 ('heated\n(\u03b1, \u03b3)' or heat-induced \u03b1 capture by heavier isotopes) is actually\nthe result of conductive heating from the shallower layers.\nThe inward heating is due to conduction. To first order,\nthe heat transport scales with A/Z 2 (Yakovlev & Urpin 1980;\nBildsten & Cutler 1995; Cumming & Bildsten 2001) where Z\nis nuclear charge and A nuclear mass number. Therefore, one\nmay expect less inward heating for a layer with heavier isotopes. The composition depends, on its turn, on the composition\nof the donor atmosphere and the accretion rate. Thus, one may\nexpect more inward heating in for instance ultra-compact X-ray\nbinaries or for accretion rates and burst regimes with high \u03b1 in\nwhich most hydrogen is burnt through the hot CNO cycle instead\nof the rp process, because the rp process produces the heaviest elements. Unfortunately, the A/Z 2 proportionality of the heat\ntransport is only a crude approximation so that inferences are not\nstraightforward, for instance by comparing different bursters or\nbursts from the same source at different accretion rates.\nThere are other dependencies of the conductivity as well,\nsuch as on ignition depth which may vary from source to source\nand burst to burst. This will not only have an effect on the duration of the tail, but also on the fluence ratio between the tail and\nthe prompt burst. For a relatively shallow ignition, the inward\nheating will not go as deep and the tail will be short and less\nfluent. This may explain qualitatively why only the first burst in\nthe triplet from EXO 0748-676 has a long tail that is unaffected\nby subsequent bursts. The subsequent bursts ignite at shallower\ndepths.\nAs mentioned above, the 'A3' model predicts a trend in the\nNS luminosity between bursts consisting of a gradual decline for\n3000 s after a burst followed by a gradual increase for 104 s up\nto the next burst (see Fig. 10). In practice it is difficult to disentangle the NS luminosity from the flux measurements, but it\n\n\fJ.J.M. in 't Zand, L. Keek, A.

Profiles of temperature (top panel), net outward luminosity (middle; dashed parts indicate inward luminosity) and specific nuclear energy\ngeneration rate (bottom) calculated as a function of depth for a flash model specifically for GS 1826-24 (model 'A3' of Heger et al. 2007). Seven\nprofiles are shown. The black curve is for t = 0 (burst onset), the other curves are for the times indicated with vertical lines in Fig. 10 with the same\ncolor. The top panel shows the inward heating (compare with the location of the heat source in the bottom panel, down to only 9 \u00d7 108 g cm\u22122 )\nthat is thought to be responsible for the long tails on the X-ray bursts of GS 1826-24. See also Fig. 12.\n\ninteresting to show the straightforward observed photon rate, see\nFig. 13. This is the same kind of measurement as shown in Fig. 2,\nexcept that it is shown linearly and between 12,000 s before and\nafter the burst time. To obtain as much data as possible, particularly far away from the bursts when the data coverage is less than\nclose to the bursts, we included 27 additional bursts for a total\nof 56. This plot does not show a clear increasing trend except\nfor the final 2\u00d7103 s before the next burst. A similar behavior,\nbut of worse statistical quality, is apparent from XMM-Newton\ndata. One would expect a linearly increasing trend for the hot\nCNO cycle according to L = 4 \u00d7 1034 (ZCNO /0.02) \u1e4017thr erg s\u22121 ,\nwith ZCNO the CNO abundance, \u1e4017 the mass accretion rate in\n1017 g s\u22121 and thr time in hours, because the amount of accumulated fuel grows linearly with time and the hot CNO burning\nrate is a constant that depends only on the CNO mass fraction\n(Hoyle & Fowler 1965). The maximum slope consistent with\nthe data shown in Fig. 13 is, for \u1e4017 = 1 (Heger et al. 2007) and\nassuming a black body temperature of 0.5 keV, equivalent to an\nupper limit of ZCNO < 0.05.\nA third idea for explaining the long tails is that the X-ray\nbursts influence the accretion disk in such a way that the accretion rate is temporarily increased. A change in accretion rate by\nX-ray bursts has been seen before. For instance, X-ray bursts\nfrom 4U 1820-303 (Strohmayer & Brown 2002) and 4U 1724-\n\n307 (Molkov et al. 2000) are so luminous that radiation pressure\nblows away the inner parts of the accretion disk, shutting off\naccretion for a few seconds. Secondly, there are suggestions in\nX-ray bursts from Cen X-4, XTE J1747-214 and 2S 1711-337\nthat X-ray bursts act as triggers for switching accretion disks\nfrom a cold neutral state to a hot ionized state a few days later\n(although that cannot be explained yet in a quantitative manner;\nKuulkers et al. 2008). Lastly, it appears that immediately before and after superbursts the persistent flux from the accretion\ndisk behaves differently in the sense that the flux has a somewhat decreased level for half a day before and an increased level\nfor approximately a day after superbursts (e.g., Cornelisse et al.\n2000, 2002; Kuulkers et al. 2002b; Keek et al. 2008). Perhaps\nthere is a 4th type of effect from X-ray bursts on disks resulting in long tails. However, 'our' long-tailed X-ray bursts are less\nenergetic than the aforementioned bursts that are either superEddington (i.e., relatively high flux) or superbursts (high fluence). The X-ray bursts from GS 1826-24 are not particularly luminous (none show photospheric radius expansion) nor extraordinarily fluent (Galloway et al. 2006). The same applies to EXO\n0748-676 (only one burst shows photospheric radius expansion;\nWolff et al. 2005). The majority of the bursts from 4U 1728-34\ndo show radius expansion, but have very small fluence due to\na very short duration (Galloway et al. 2003).

The hatched regions indicate convective layers (green\nhatched for convection and red cross-hatched for semiconvection; see\nWoosley et al. 2004). The convective region between 102 and 103 s is\nlocated at the bottom of the hydrogen left over after the burst and is\nprobably due to a Rayleigh-Taylor instability related to composition inversion resulting from the burning. It does not have a major influence\non the structure and evolution of the model. '\u03b2CNO' refers to a variety\nof the CNO cycle where the reaction rates are limited by \u03b2 decays; this\nis the 'hot' CNO cycle. '(\u03b1, \u03b3)' refers to \u03b1 capture by heavier isotopes\nsuch as 12 C and 16 O. A series of bursts is shown; the next burst occurs\nat log(time/s)=4.15.\n\ndensity spectra before the burst and during the tail are not significantly different (c.f., Fig. 6), suggesting no change in accretion\nstream or rate. We believe that an explanation for the long tails\nin terms of a changed accretion environment is less likely.\n5.2. Lack of strong cooling, decreasing black body area\n\nThe lack of cooling could be explained by Compton upscattering of all photons by the hot plasma that surrounds the\nNS and the temperature inferred from the spectrum may in fact\nbe representative of the plasma rather than the NS. A problem\nof this explanation is that the inferred emission area drops so\nsuddenly in both GS 1826-24 and EXO 0748-676, after 100 and\n60 s respectively. The temperature of the burst at that time is\nstill sufficiently high that one should detect large numbers of unscattered photons. A decline of the normalization, if at all, is\nexpected to be more gradual.\nAnother, in our opinion more likely, explanation is that the\nneutron star may already be fairly hot without the heating by\nthermonuclear flashes. The effective temperature can then never\ndrop below the 'quiescent' NS value. There is sufficient persistent energy production to sustain a NS hot enough to explain our\nmeasurements, by stable hydrogen burning via the hot CNO cycle (the model depicted in Fig. 11 predicts about 1\u00d71035 erg s\u22121 ),\npycnonuclear reactions and electron capture processes in the\ncrust (the same model assumes 1.6 \u00d7 1034 erg s\u22121 or 0.15\nMeV/nucleon). Gravitational energy release by the settling of the\naccreted processed matter in the envelope is negligible for these\naccretion rates (Brown & Bildsten 1998). Gravitational energy\n\n\u22125000\n\n0\nTime [sec]\n\n5000\n\n104\n\nFig. 13. Average time profile of 56 X-ray bursts from GS 1826-24 as\nmeasured with PCU2 on RXTE/PCA in 2-9 keV, now zooming out to\ntimes further away from the burst.\n\nrelease by accretion occurs just outside the NS, is radiated away\nfrom the NS (King 1995), and is decoupled from the burst emission as long as the burst flux is less than the Eddington limit.\nThe total energy production rate depends on the mass accretion\nrate and the H and CNO abundance of the donor atmosphere.\nAlso, it may partly heat up the core instead of the photosphere.\nLuminosities are expected to reach up to at least a few times\n1035 erg s\u22121 . For a canonical 10 km NS radius and ignoring\nthe gravitational redshift of a few tens of percents, the StefanBoltmann law predicts for a luminosity of 2\u00d71035 erg s\u22121 an effective temperature of the non-bursting NS of order 0.4 keV. If a\nburst occurs, the photosphere temperature rises to a few keV and\nthe emission is completely dominated by this extra heating, but\nif the temperature becomes comparable to the quiescent value,\nin the tail of the burst, the spectrum is strongly affected by the\nalready hot NS. In a standard time-resolved spectroscopic analysis, where a pre-burst spectrum is subtracted and the net spectrum is modeled through a black body, one actually subtracts\none Planck function from another. The resulting function is not\na Planck function and if, nevertheless, it is modeled as such, the\nphysical meaning of inferred emission areas is lost. This effect\nhas been extensively studied by van Paradijs & Lewin (1986).\nThey find 1) that it is particularly important in the tail of an Xray burst; 2) that the fit results in constant temperatures and decreasing emission areas, as we find in our analyses, and 3) that\nthe derived temperature has a tight relationship with the NS temperature: the measured temperature is about 30% higher than the\nNS temperature outside bursts. Taken at face value, our measurements imply a NS temperature of 0.7-0.8 keV for both GS 182624 and EXO 0748-676, ignoring again gravitational redshift and\ndeviations from black body radiation that become more significant towards lower temperatures (e.g., Zavlin et al. 1996). This\nis encouragingly close to the simple prediction done above of 0.4\nkeV. A similar effect in reversed time order may be happening\nduring the rise phase of bursts from GS 1826-24.\nKuulkers et al. (2002a) investigate this effect in detail for\nbursts from the high- \u1e40 system GX 17+2. van Paradijs & Lewin\n(1986) suggest to study burst data without subtracting the preburst spectrum and employing a model that includes components\nfor the accretion disk emission and a black body for the thermal\n\n\f5.3. Long tails in other sources\n\nFigure 14 shows the time profiles of the bolometric flux for 4U\n1728-34 and EXO 0748-676, together with that for GS 1826-24.\nThese are the same data as shown in the top panels of Figs. 4,\n7 and 9, except that one earlier time bin is shown. For convenience the fluxes have been normalized to the respective peak\nvalues. This figure shows that there is one property that distinguishes GS 1826-24 from the other two sources: there is a clear\ndifference between the prompt and the tail phase. The tails of 4U\n1728-34 and EXO 0748-676 are smooth extensions of the initial\nburst phase. This may be related to the energetic contribution\n\n0.1\n0.01\n\nBol. flux [normalized to peak]\n\n10\u22123\n\nemission from the NS. Kuulkers et al. (2002a) follow this suggestion and model the accretion disk emission by a cutoff power\nlaw. They find unacceptable values for the goodness of fit and\ndismiss the explanation by an already hot NS and put forward\nthe possibility that the decreasing black body radius is connected\nto blanketing effects in the NS atmosphere and comptonization\nof burst photons in the NS atmosphere. Theoretical calculations\n(London et al. 1986; Ebisuzaki 1987; Pavlov et al. 1991; Zavlin\net al. 1996; Majczyna et al. 2005) show that the color temperature is between 1.2 and 1.7 times the effective temperature. The\nfitted black body radius thus decreases by the square of that, to\nmaintain the same bolometric flux. This cannot explain the drop\nin radius that we observe which is at least a factor of 5.\nAs Kuulkers et al. (2002b) point out, the reason for the unsuccesful modeling for GX 17+2 is that the accretion disk spectrum also contains a strong black body component due to the\nhigh \u1e40 in this LMXB. The disk black body has an only slightly\nhigher temperature than that expected of the NS and therefore\nthe latter is difficult to distinguish. Also, in GX 17+2 the lowenergy absorption is high with NH = 1.9 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 (Farinelli\net al. 2007) so that it is tough to find evidence for a NS of temperature kT \u2248 0.5 keV. Finally, the flux is expected to be low,\nof order 0.1% of the burst peak, so that accumulating a statistically relevant spectrum is challenging. Our measurements of\nGS 1826-24 do not suffer from these difficulties. Perhaps a decreasing radius and a flattening temperature in a 'standard' burst\nanalysis (i.e., with subtraction of the pre-burst spectrum) constitute the best possible evidence for a hot NS.\nWe note that many X-ray bursts in the RXTE catalog\n(Galloway et al. 2008) show similar behavior: temperatures remaining above \u22481 keV and decreasing fitted radii. Since an explanation by a NS that is already hot without flashes is more\nlikely to be applicable to a major portion of the burster population than scattering in a hot circumstellar plasma, this provides\nadditional support to that explanation. However, these data are\nvulnerable to lack of low-energy coverage of the PCA, as well\nas from sometimes high absorption columns. As a result, it is\nquite difficult to accurately measure kT below 1 keV. GS 182624 is one of the few cases where this problem does not exist: we\nhave the XMM-Newton data to corroborate the RXTE data and\na low NH .\nWe furthermore note that the behavior of burst tails in\nUCXBs is expected to be markedly different in the hot-NS scenario for two reasons. Firstly, UCXBs have much lower H abundances so that hot CNO burning provides much less heating\noutside flashes. Secondly, in many UCXBs the accretion rate is\nlower so that again the energy production rate is lower outside\nbursts and the NS cooler. This expectation is in line with highsensitivity spectroscopy of some X-ray bursts from UCXBs, for\nexample in A 1246-588 (in 't Zand et al. 2008) where the temperature is seen to decay to 0.5 keV.\n\n11\n\n1\n\nJ.J.M. in 't Zand, L.

Fluxes are renormalized with the respective\npeak values.\n\nof the rp-process being larger in GS 1826-24 (cf, Fig. 12). It is\nprobably not related to a smaller amount of inward heating in 4U\n1728-34 and EXO 0748-676. The alternative explanation, deeper\nignition depths in 4U 1728-34 and EXO 0748-676, is not consistent with the small burst recurrence times, similar to GS 1826-24\n(Galloway et al. 2008).\nThe other documented cases (Swank et al. 1977; Czerny\net al. 1987; Gotthelf & Kulkarni 1997; Chenevez et al. 2006, see\nTable 2) do seem to have dual time profiles. Their higher tail-topeak flux ratio indicates that the heating to the deeper layers can\nbe even more efficient than seen in GS 1826-24. Perhaps there is\na smaller abundance of heavy isotopes. However, this is difficult\nto assess quantitatively because a quantitative comparison with\ntheoretical models has yet to be carried out.\nAn exceptional case is the long tail in GX 3+1 (Chenevez\net al. 2006). It contains much more fluence than the prompt burst,\nperhaps 40 times as much1 ! Aql X-1 (Czerny et al. 1987) and the\nsource in M28 (Gotthelf & Kulkarni 1997) may also have large\nfluence ratios but there are data gaps that preclude verification.\nIf interpreted as direct NS emission, this cannot be explained\nthrough cooling of deep layers, particularly since the prompt fluence is similar to that for other bursts from GX 3+1 that do not\nshow a long tail. One difference that distinguishes these other\ncases from the cases discussed in the paper is that they were most\nprobably in a different burst regime when the long-tailed bursts\noccurred, namely in a regime without continuous hot-CNO hydrogen burning.\nSeveral classes of long X-ray bursts, with e-folding decay\ntimes in excess of roughly 100 s, have been discovered in the\npast decade. This includes superbursts (flashes of 100 m thick\ncarbon-rich layers; for a recent list, see Keek & in 't Zand 2008)\nand intermediately long bursts that may result from flashes of\n10 m thick helium layers (in 't Zand et al. 2005; Cumming et al.\n2006; in 't Zand et al. 2007) or otherwise (Chenevez et al. 2007;\nLinares et al. 2008). With the present paper, one realizes that\neven the 'classical' short X-ray bursts can be similarly long in\nsome sense. The distinguishing factor is that these bursts initiate\n1\nthis value depends on where the boundary between prompt burst\nand tail is chosen, but it is always significantly larger than 1\n\n\f12\n\nJ.J.M. in 't Zand, L. Keek, A. Cumming et al.: Long tails on thermonuclear X-ray bursts\n\nwith a normal-sized X-ray burst and that, probably, the implied\nthick layer is not heated locally by nuclear reactions but by conduction from a hotter layer on top.\n\n6. Conclusion\nWe have detected an hour-long tail to bursts in GS 1826-24 with\nfluxes and fluences that are two orders of magnitude smaller than\nthose of the bursts themselves. We have found similar tails in\nbursts from 4U 1728-34 and EXO 0748-676, although they are\nless distinguished from the prompt burst emission. While detection in other bursters is hampered by varying accretion fluxes of\nsimilar magnitude, there are reports of individual cases of bursts\nwith long tails, most notably in GX 3+1 (Chenevez et al. 2006).\nModel calculations show that the tail in GS 1826-24 can be explained by delayed cooling of layers that are up to ten times\ndeeper in column density than where the flash occurs and that\nwere heated up through inward conduction of the flash heat.\nPossibly tails in other sources can be similarly explained. Further\nmodel calculations are needed, where dependencies of donor\ncomposition, ignition depth and accretion rate are taken into account. Comparing such calculations to different kinds of bursts\nand bursters may yield constraints on the details of conduction\nin the neutron star envelope.\nA characteristic of the tails, that at first hand is unexpected in\nthis scenario, is the small amount of cooling. Rather than being\ndue to up-scattering of the burst photons by a hotter opticallythick plasma, we believe that the most likely explanation is that\nthe NS is already hot without flashes. The temperature that one\nmeasures in the burst tail is then representative for the nonbursting NS. This scenario also provides a more natural explanation for the decreasing black body normalization in the tails.\nAs discussed by van Paradijs & Lewin (1986), this presents an\ninteresting opportunity to study NS temperatures as a function\nof accretion rate. However, this may be a cumbersome. Apart\nfrom good low-energy coverage, one would need to work on a\nsingle-burst basis, also for the accurate modeling of the persistent spectrum. Better data would be needed than presented here.\nAcknowledgements.
