Introduction\nBecause of the availability of large high-quality single crystals, YBa2 Cu3 O7\u2212\u03b4 is one of\nthe most widely studied of the high temperature superconductors (HTS). As with other\nHTS, the essential structural components are the two-dimensional (2D) CuO2 layers. In\nthese layers, the Cu and O orbitals are partially filled and are therefore conducting. The\ninterlayer coupling is generally weak, meaning that the electronic bands contributing at\nthe Fermi energy derive most of their weight from individual CuO2 layers. For this\nreason, the standard model for a generic cuprate HTS consists of a single 2D CuO2\nlayer in isolation.\nYBa2 Cu3 O7\u2212\u03b4 differs from other cuprate HTS in one significant respect: in addition\nto the CuO2 layers, there are layers of one-dimensional (1D) chains. Band structure\ncalculations[1] suggest that the chains are roughly one-quarter filled, and contribute a\nquasi-1D Fermi surface. Despite this, the chains are nearly always ignored in theories\nof YBa2 Cu3 O7\u2212\u03b4 , presumably because it has many physical properties that are common\nto all HTS, suggesting a minor role for the chains. In addition, the metallicity of the\nchains has been questioned, either because electrons in 1D are localized by arbitrarily\nweak disorder, or because they are unstable towards the formation of insulating charge\ndensity wave states.\nEarly evidence for the metallicity of the chains came from measurements of the\nresistivity anisotropy[2], which found \u03c1a /\u03c1b \u2248 2 at 100 K, where \u03c1a and \u03c1b are the\nresistivities parallel to the two axes of the CuO2 planes, and where b is also parallel to\nthe chains. Such an anisotropy is expected if the chains are conducting and carry current\nin parallel with the planes. Since O-vacancies, which are prevalent in YBa2 Cu3 O7\u2212\u03b4 ,\nwould strongly localize 1D electrons, the observed anisotropy appears to indicate a\nrelatively large hybridization of chain and plane states. Further support for this comes\nfrom c-axis (perpendicular to the planes) resistivity measurements[3, 4] which find an\nanisotropy \u03c1c /\u03c1a \u2248 50 at 100 K in optimally-doped YBa2 Cu3 O6.93 . In a tight binding\nmodel, this corresponds to t\u22a5 /t \u2248 7 where t and t\u22a5 are the in-plane and perpendicular\nhopping amplitudes. This anisotropy is smaller than in other HTS and suggests coherent\nc-axis transport[5].\nThere has been some debate as to whether the CuO chains undergo a Peierls\ntransition to a charge density wave state. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)\nexperiments on chain-terminated surfaces found charge modulations which were\ninterpreted as charge density waves.[6] However, later experiments[7] found that the\nmodulation wavelength depends on the bias voltage of the STM tip, which is a\ncharacteristic of Friedel oscillations (i.e. standing wave patters produced by impurity\nscattering of itinerant electrons) rather than charge density waves. These later\nexperiments are consistent with metallic chains.\nDirect evidence for a chain Fermi surface has recently been found in a number\nof angle resolved photoemission experiments[8, 9, 10]. The Fermi surface appears\nto be consistent with that predicted by band structure calculations, although a\n\n\fEffect of Chains on the LDOS in the Vortex Phase of YBCO\n\n3\n\ncomplete characterization of the band structure is rendered difficult by the existence\nof surface states, which dominate surface-sensitive experiments such as tunneling and\nphotoemission. The correspondence between the surface states and electronic states in\nthe bulk is not yet established.\nComplementary information on the chain states comes from penetration depth\nanisotropy measurements[11, 12] which indicate that the chains are superconducting\nbelow the bulk critical temperature Tc , and have a substantial superfluid density.\nBecause the chains and CuO2 planes are structurally different, the apparent similarity\nof their superconducting states, as measured by the penetration depth, was puzzling\nfor many years. The chains, being far from half-filled, should not have an intrinsic\npairing interaction capable of producing high critical temperatures. A more likely\nscenario is that the chains derive their superconductivity from proximity coupling to the\nCuO2 planes.[13] Calculations showed that proximity models for chain superconductivity\nintroduce small energy scales related to the induced gap in the chains. To date, these\nsmall scales have not been observed in penetration depth measurements.[14] It was\nlater shown[15] that the smallest energy scale, which is relevant to low temperature\nmeasurements, comes from a subset of chain-derived electronic states that are weakly\nhybridized with the CuO2 planes. Since these particular states have a predominantly\n1D character, they are are strongly affected by localization corrections due to chain\ndisorder, and are therefore difficult to detect via the electrodynamic response.\nSmall energy scales have been seen in other experiments. For example, it has been\nfound[16, 17] that the vortex cores in YBa2 Cu3 O7\u2212\u03b4 , as measured by \u03bcSR experiments,\nare much larger at small magnetic fields B than expected from the measured upper\ncritical field, and that the cores contract rapidly with increasing B below a crossover field\nB \u2217 . This anomalous behaviour has been explained by the presence of CuO chains[18, 19],\nand it can be shown that B \u2217 \u223c Es2 . It has also been suggested that a similar small energy\nscale seen in tunneling experiments[20, 21, 22] can be attributed to the chains.\nIn summary, we argue that there is reasonable evidence that the CuO chains in\nYBa2 Cu3 O7\u2212\u03b4 (a) are metallic, (b) are signifcantly hybridized with the CuO2 planes,\nand (c) superconduct as a result of this hybridization. There remain many unresolved\nquestions regarding the role of the chains, however. First, there are practical issues:\nneither the strength nor momentum-dependence of the chain-plane coupling have been\nestablished with any degree of certainty. Second, there are questions of fundamental\ninterest: what are the properties of a weakly correlated 1D metal in close contact\nwith a strongly-correlated electron liquid. Finally, there is the question of how the\nchains manifest themselves in various experiments. In some cases, for example transport\nanisotropy, the role played by the chains is intuitively obvious. However, in many cases,\nthe effects of the chains are not a priori obvious, as in the case of the vortex core\ncontraction mentioned above.\nIn this work, we examine the effects of chains on the local density of states\n(LDOS) \u03c1(r, \u03c9) in the vortex state of YBa2 Cu3 O7 . Experiments have found that the\nelectronic structure of vortices in YBa2 Cu3 O7\u2212\u03b4 is different from other HTS[23] and\n\n\f4\n\nEffect of Chains on the LDOS in the Vortex Phase of YBCO\n(b) 2.5\n\n40\n\n2\n\n20\n\n1.5\n\ny\n\n(a) 60\n\n1\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\nx\n(c) 60\n\n\u03c1(r,\u03c9)\n\n0\n0\n\n0.3\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n\u22120.5\n\ny\n\n40\n20\n0\n0\n\n0.05\n0.025\n\n20\n\n40\nx\n\n60\n\n0.5\n\n\u22121\n\u22121.5\n\u22121\n\n0\n\u03c9\n\n1\n\nFigure 1.

The figure shows a pair of vortices belonging to a square\nlattice whose axes are rotated 45\u25e6 relative to the crystalline axes (which are parallel to\nthe figure axes). (b) Local density of states at a series of positions along the line drawn\nthrough the lower vortex core in (a). Note that the nondispersing peak at \u03c9 = \u22120.9\nis a van Hove singularity associated with the band structure. Far from the vortex\ncore, the d-wave order parameter is |\u2206| = 0.38. (c) The LDOS \u03c1(r, \u03b5F ) is shown as a\nfunction of position near a single vortex core. Note the logarithmic scale. Here and\nthroughout the Fermi energy is \u03b5F = 0.\n\nfrom theoretical calculations[24, 25]. Theory predicts that, for a single superconducting\nlayer with a d-wave order parameter, there should be a peak in the LDOS at the vortex\ncore centre (a \"zero bias conduction peak\" or ZBCP), and that as one moves away from\nthe core, the peak splits and disperses towards higher energies, eventually merging with\nthe coherence peaks far from the vortex core. This behaviour is illustrated in Figure 1,\nwhere the results of a calculation performed for a single-layer version of the model used\nin this work are shown.\nExperimentally, the situation is rather different. The ZBCP at the vortex core\nis absent, and a pair of finite-energy peaks at \u03c9 \u2248 \u00b15 meV are present instead.\nFurthermore, unlike the calculations, these peaks do not shift significantly as one moves\naway from the vortex core. It is possible that these peaks have the same origin as peaks\nmeasured in zero-field tunneling experiments, but this is not established.\nIn this work we ask two questions: (i) what are the signatures of the chains in the\nvortex structure within the proximity model and (ii) to what extent can the proximity\nmodel explain the existing experiments?\n\n\fEffect of Chains on the LDOS in the Vortex Phase of YBCO\n\n5\n\n2. Method\nSince the technical details of the calculation have been given in [19], we only give a\nsummary of the main ideas here. The plane-chain model is made up of a single bilayer\nconsisting of a tetragonal 2D plane layer (representing a CuO2 layer) and a layer of 1D\nchains (representing a CuO layer). The layers are connected by single electron hopping,\nso that the plane and chain bands hybridize to form new bands. These bands have\neither predominantly plane or chain character, and we refer to them as plane-derived or\nchain-derived respectively. The chain layer is represented by a tight binding Hamiltonian\nwith a single orbital per unit cell. In band structure calculations, this orbital is a linear\ncombination of the chain Cudz2 \u2212y2 and Opy orbitals.[1] The CuO2 band structure is also\nrepresented by a tight binding model with a single orbital per unit cell. In this case,\nthe orbital represents a singlet state involving the Cudz2 \u2212y2 and Op(x,y) orbitals.[26].\nThere is a pairing interaction in the plane layer leading to d-wave superconductivity,\nbut the chain layer is intrinsically normal. Nonetheless, the chain superconducts because\nof the the proximity effect; single electron hopping between the plane and chain layers\ninduces a gap in the chains. One important feature of the proximity model is that the\ninduced gap in the chains does not share the d-wave symmetry of the plane layer[15].\nThis is because the chain dispersion is quasi-1D, and the k-dependence of the excitation\ngap depends on the symmetry of both the order parameter and the underlying band.\nWe define coordinates x, y, and z which are aligned with the crystalline axes\na, b, and c respectively, and consider a magnetic field aligned with the c-axis. The\nscreening currents, therefore, circulate within the plane and chain layers. It is for this\nconfiguration that the vortex core contraction is seen in \u03bcSR experiments,[16] and that\nSTM experiments are performed.\nThe Hamiltonian is\n\u0124 = \u01241 + \u01242 + \u0124\u22a5 .\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u01241 is the Hamiltonian for the isolated plane, \u01242 the Hamiltonian for the isolated\nchains, and \u0124\u22a5 the single-electron hopping term that couples the two layers. For\ncomparison, we also consider a single-layer model described by \u01241 alone.

With these\ndefinitions, we have taken the magnitude of the nearest-neighbour hopping (i.e. |t1,nn |)\nas the scale of energy. This will be our energy scale throughout this work, and a rough\ncomparison to experiments may be made by taking t1,nn \u223c 100 meV. However, we\nemphasize that quantitative comparisons to experiments are not possible because the\nmodel parameters are chosen for numerical convenience (i.e. such that the energy scale\nEs associated with chain superconductivity is easily resolved), rather than to reproduce\nthe YBa2 Cu3 O7\u2212\u03b4 band structure accurately.\nThere is a quasi-periodicity which allows us to define an Lx \u00d7 Ly magnetic supercell\ncontaining N = Lx Ly /a20 atomic lattice sites (a0 is the lattice constant) and enclosing\ntwo superconducting flux quanta (i.e. two vortices), where the superconducting flux\nquantum is \u03a60 \u2261 hc/2e. The magnetic field is therefore B = 2\u03a60 /Lx Ly . In order\nto obtain low magnetic fields, we need large values of Lx and Ly . Unless otherwise\nstated, all results shown in this paper are for a 60 \u00d7 60 \u00d7 Nz -site supercell (Nz = 1, 2)\ncorresponding to B = 2\u03a60 /3600. For this case, we sum over 52 = 25 K-vectors, which\n\n\fEffect of Chains on the LDOS in the Vortex Phase of YBCO\n\n7\n\nis formally equivalent to studying a system of 50 vortices on a 300 \u00d7 300 \u00d7 2 site lattice.\nTaking a unit cell size of a0 = 4 \u00c5, this corresponds to B = 7 T. While this is a strong\nfield for YBa2 Cu3 O7\u2212\u03b4 , we have chosen the model parameters such that this is in the\nlow-field limit of the proximity model (i.e. chain superconductivity is not quenched at\nthis field).\nThe details of the transformation to Bloch states are given in [19]. Here, we\nsimply mention that our self-consistent calculations proceed in several steps. First, we\ndiagonalize the Hamiltonian to generate a set of eigenenergies Ei,K and wavefunctions\n\u03a8\u03b1,K (n, \u03c3, r) where K are the supercell wavevectors, \u03b1 \u2208 (1, 2N) (the factor of two is for\nspin) is a quantum number labelling the eigenenergies for each K, n = 1, 2 refers to the\nlayer, and r to sites within each layer. Note that a Bogolyubov transformation has been\nmade, such that the spin index refers to spin-up electrons with wavevector K (\u03c3 =\u2191)\nor spin-down holes with wavevector \u2212K (\u03c3 =\u2193). The second step is to calculate the\nFourier-transformed order parameter \u2206ij (K) from the wavefunctions. This new order\nparameter is inserted into the Hamiltonian, and a new set of eigenfunctions and energies\nis calculated. The iterative process terminates when the largest difference between the\ninput and output values of \u2206ij (K) is less than 10\u22123 .\nWe present results for two observables in this work. The LDOS at energy \u03c9 in layer\nn is\n2N\n1 XX\u0002\n|\u03a8\u03b1,K (n, \u2191, r)|2\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 E\u03b1,K )\n\u03c1n (r, \u03c9) =\nNk K \u03b1=1\n\u0003\n+|\u03a8\u03b1,K (n, \u2193, r)|2\u03b4(\u03c9 + E\u03b1,K ) ,\n(7)\nP\nP\nand the total density of states (DOS) is \u03c1(\u03c9) = N \u22121 n r \u03c1n (r, \u03c9) where N is the\ntotal number of sites in the lattice. The second observable is the 2D current density in\nlayer n, denoted by jn (r) = (jn,x (r), jn,y (r)) with\n2N\n1 XX\n\u2212e\nf (E\u03b1,K )\nIm\njn,x (ri ) =\n2~a0 Nk K \u03b1=1\n1 X\u0002\n\u00d7\nt\u0303n,ij (K)\u03a8\u2217\u03b1,K (n, \u2191, ri )\u03a8\u03b1,K (n, \u2191, ri \u00b1 a0 x\u0302)\n2 \u00b1\n\u0003\n\u2212t\u0303ij (\u2212K)\u03a8\u03b1,K (n, \u2193, ri )\u03a8\u2217\u03b1,K (n, \u2193, ri \u00b1 a0 x\u0302) ,\n\n(8)\n\nand a similar expression for jyn (ri ). Note that the layer index n is omitted when we\npresent quantities for the single-layer model.\n3. Results and Discussion\nThe LDOS is shown in Figure 1 for a model consisting of a single tetragonal plane.\nThis case is well-studied, and we include it here as a point of comparison for later\ncalculations. In this figure, one sees a ZBCP at the vortex core. Away from the vortex\ncore, the ZBCP splits into two peaks which disperse away from the Fermi energy \u03b5F\nas the distance to the core increases, eventually merging with the coherence peaks at\n\n\f8\n\nEffect of Chains on the LDOS in the Vortex Phase of YBCO\n0.4\nBilayer DOS (B=0)\n\nSingle Layer (B60)\nBilayer (B60)\nBilayer (B30)\n\n\u03c0\n\n0.3\nC\n\n\u03c1(\u03c9)\n\n0\n\nB\n\u03c0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\nB\nC\n\n0.1\n(a)\n0\n\nA\n\n-0.4 -0.2\n\n(b)\n0\n\u03c9\n\n0.2\n\n0.4 -0.4 -0.2\n\n0\n\u03c9\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nFigure 2.

(b)\nThe effect of magnetic field on the spatially-averaged DOS. The field strengths are\nB = 2\u03a60 /602 (B60) and B = 2\u03a60 /302 (B30). The latter results are calculated using a\n30 \u00d7 30 \u00d7 2 lattice with 152 supercell K-points.\n\n\u03c9 = \u00b1EL . This is the behaviour predicted for isolated vortices in both s-[27] and dwave[25, 24, 28] superconductors. For an isolated vortex in an s-wave superconductor,\nquasiparticle eigenstates have a well-defined angular momentum, and it was shown that\npeaks at different distances from the core correspond to different angular momentum\neigenstates. Sufficiently near the core, both the peak energy and distance to the core are\nlinearly proportional to the angular momentum.[29] As we will show, this relationship\nbetween angular momentum and the peak energy is relevant to the electronic structure\nof CuO chains in the vortex state.\nWe remark that, although dispersing peaks have been observed experimentally in\nthe s-wave superconductor NbSe2 [30], they have not been seen in either YBa2 Cu3 O7\u2212\u03b4\nor Bi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8 .[23] A number of strong-correlation-related mechanisms have been\nproposed for the absence of the ZBCP[23], and it is known that disorder can suppress\nthe ZBCP[23]. Furthermore, it is possible that nontrivial tunneling matrix elements can\nsignificantly alter the LDOS.[31] At present, the reason for the lack of a ZBCP in the\nHTS has not been resolved.\nThe spatial dependence of the LDOS at the Fermi energy, \u03c1(r, \u03b5F ), is plotted in\nFigure 1(c). A logarithmic plot is used to emphasize the long-range tails extending from\nthe vortex core. These are a signature of BCS-like d-wave superconductivity[25] and,\nlike the ZBCP, have not been seen experimentally. Again, the reason for this is not\nclear.\n\n\fEffect of Chains on the LDOS in the Vortex Phase of YBCO\n\n9\n\nIn Figure 2, we compare the spatially-averaged density of states for three different\ncases: the bilayer model in zero magnetic field, and the single-layer and bilayer\nmodels for B 6= 0. This figure shows that the DOS for the bilayer model has a\nrelatively complicated structure when B = 0, with four distinct energy scales (see\n[15] for a complete discussion). First, the coherence peaks associated with plane\nsuperconductivity are split by chain-plane coupling (A). A similar splitting has been\nobserved in STM experiments[22]. We identify the lower-energy of the two coherence\npeaks as the \"large gap\" EL . Because the chains act as pair-breakers, EL is slightly\nsmaller than the gap in the single-layer model. Next, there are two gap energy scales\nassociated with induced superconductivity in the chains. The larger of these (B) comes\nfrom the region of the chain-derived Fermi surface nearest (\u03c0, 0) in the Brillouin zone.\nHere, the energetic proximity of the chain and plane bands leads to a large hybridization\nof their wavefunctions and a relatively large induced gap. We believe that this energy\nscale, denoted Es , is the small gap that has been seen in STM experiments in zero field.\nThe smallest energy scale (C) is associated with superconductivity on the portion of the\nchain Fermi surface nearest the Brillouin zone centre. This gap is wiped out by small\namounts of disorder or thermal broadening, and the proximity model therefore predicts\na finite residual density of states at the Fermi energy, in accordance with tunneling\nexperiments.[20, 21, 22]\nThe finite-field DOS is shown in Figure 2(b). The field washes out the distinct\nenergy scales; however, Es shows up in the field-dependence of the DOS. Compared with\nthe single-layer model, \u03c1(\u03b5F ) for the bilayer model is a strong function of B for B < B \u2217 ,\nwhere B \u2217 \u223c Es2 [19] is the crossover field mentioned above. For B > B \u2217 , \u03c1(\u03b5F ) varies\nat a similar rate with B in both the single-layer and bilayer models. Similar behaviour\nhas been predicted in an anisotropic single-band model for YBa2 Cu3 O7\u2212\u03b4 [32]. In the\nbilayer model studied here, B \u2217 is the magnetic field above which the vortex cores in\nthe chains begin to overlap. From the perspective of the chains, there are therefore\ndistinct low- (B < B \u2217 ) and high- (B > B \u2217 ) field regimes. Experimentally, B \u2217 \u2248 1 T in\nYBa2 Cu3 O6.95 . Because we have chosen a large value for the chain-plane coupling, the\ndata shown here for the 60 \u00d7 60 \u00d7 2 lattices belong to the regime B < B \u2217 .\nThe LDOS for the bilayer is shown along a series of cuts through the vortex along\nthe (1, 0) direction in Figure 3, the (1, 1) direction in Figure 4, and the (0, 1) direction in\nFigure 5. The cuts are illustrated in Figure 3(d). There are three sources of anisotropy\nwhich contribute to differences in \u03c1n (r, \u03c9) along the three directions. First, the dwave order parameter vanishes for quasiparticles travelling in the (1, \u00b11) directions and\nobtains its maximum along the (1, 0) and (0, 1) directions. Second, the shortest path\nbetween vortices lies along the (1, \u00b11) directions. Third, the chains run parallel to the\n(0, 1) direction. We can separate the third factor from the first two by comparing our\nbilayer results with those for the single-layer model.\nFirst, we consider the cut along the (1, 0) direction (Figure 3). The LDOS in the\nplane layer exhibits one notable difference from the single layer case shown in Figure 1:\nthe ZBCP splits into a quartet, instead of a pair, of dispersing peaks as one moves away\n\n\f10\n\nEffect of Chains on the LDOS in the Vortex Phase of YBCO\n2\n\n1\n\n0.4\n\n(a)\n\nI\n\n0.8\n\n0.2\n\n0.6\n\n0\n\u22120.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\nO (c)\n\n0\n\u03c9\n\n0.5\n\n60\n\n0.4\n\n(d)\ny\n\n\u03c1n(r,\u03c9)\n\n1.5\n\n(b)\n\n0.2\n\n(0,1) (1,1)\n(1,0)\n\n0\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0\n\u03c9\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0\n\u03c9\n\n0.5\n\n0\n0\n\nx\n\n60\n\nFigure 3.

(d) Spatial dependence of the\ncurrent density |j1 (r)| in the plane layer for a pair of vortices. The lines indicate the\ncuts along which LDOS curves are displayed in this figure [(1, 0)], Figure 4 [(1, 1)] and\nFigure 5 [(0, 1)]. Note that the (0, 1) and (1, 0) cuts are parallel and perpendicular to\nthe chains respectively.\n\nfrom the vortex core. The outer peaks asymptotically approach EL at large distances\nfrom the vortex core, while the inner peaks asymptotically approach Es . It appears as if\nthe presence of two superconducting energy scales leads to the formation of two distinct\nsets of dispersing quasi-bound resonances.\nThe LDOS curves shown in Figure 3(b) come from different chains at increasing\ndistances from the vortex core. As in the plane, there is a ZBCP at the vortex core. The\nsplitting of the ZBCP that is readily apparent in the plane layer is also present, although\ndifficult to resolve, in the chain layer. The LDOS curves far from the vortex core closely\nresemble the DOS for the chains when B = 0: there is a pronounced suppression of the\nDOS for |\u03c9| < Es , a large residual DOS at \u03c9 = \u03b5F , and there are weak remnants of the\ncoherence peaks at EL coming from the superconductivity in the planes.\nThe LDOS is shown along the (1, 1) direction in Figure 4. In both the single-layer\nand bilayer models, the peaks disperse more quickly along the (1, 1) direction than along\nthe (1, 0) direction. Furthermore, in the case of the bilayer model, the inner peaks are\nweak and difficult to resolve.\nWhen the cut is taken along the (0, 1) direction (Figure 5), the single layer model\ngives the same LDOS curves as in the (1, 0) direction, as required by the fourfold\nsymmetry of the lattice. The bilayer model, however, is qualitatively different along\nthe (0, 1) and (1, 0) cuts. In the plane layer, there are a pair of dispersing peaks\n\n\f11\n\nEffect of Chains on the LDOS in the Vortex Phase of YBCO\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n(a)\n0.8\n\n1.5\n\nn\n\n\u03c1 (r,\u03c9)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n1.5\n\n0.6\n1\n\n1\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n0.2\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0\n\u03c9\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0\n\u03c9\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0\n\u03c9\n\n0.5\n\nFigure 4.

Figures show\n\u03c1n (r, \u03c9) as a function of r for the single-layer (Nz = 1; top row), and bilayer model\n(Nz = 2; middle and bottom rows). Each column corresponds to a different value of\n\u03c9, indicated at the top of the column.\n\nthat asymptotically approach \u00b1EL at large distances from the vortex core. These\npeaks correspond to the outer peaks found along the (1, 0) direction. In contrast, the\ninner peaks that are seen along the (1, 0) direction are absent here. Instead, there\nis a pronounced ZBCP that extends \u223c 10 unit cells from the vortex core along the\n(0, 1) direction. The ZBCP is particularly pronounced in the chain layer, where extends\na longer distance than in the plane layer. Closer examination reveals a very slight\nsplitting of the peak at large distances. For reasons discussed below, we believe that\nthis splitting occurs because chain-plane coupling makes the chain-derived states weakly\n2D.\nFor comparison, the spatial maps of \u03c1n (r, \u03c9) are shown at three different values of\n\u03c9 in Figure 6. This figure provides a different perspective on the results presented in\nthe preceding discussion. We begin with the plots for \u03c9 = \u03b5F . The single-layer model\nexhibits a fourfold symmetry, as expected. The ZBCP appears as the bright cross in the\nmiddle of each vortex core, and disappears away from core, where the peaks disperse to\nhigher energies. In the bilayer model, we can clearly see that the LDOS in the plane,\n\u03c11 (r, \u03b5F ), is orthorhomically distorted and has long tails along the chain direction. In\nthe chain layer, the vortex core is even more anisotropic; the extent of the core states\nalong the a-axis is similar to that in the plane layer, but the extent along the b-axis is\ndetermined by the coherence length in the chains, \u03bec = ~vF,c /\u03c0Es \u2248 10a0 , where vF,c is\nthe chain Fermi velocity.\nAt the two larger values of \u03c9, the LDOS shows a vortex core that appears to expand\nwith increasing \u03c9. This is because the apparent border of the core is determined by the\npositions of the dispersing peaks at that value of \u03c9. As discussed earlier, the position and\n\n\fEffect of Chains on the LDOS in the Vortex Phase of YBCO\n\n13\n\nenergy of these peaks are approximately linearly related. The most noticeable difference\nbetween the single-layer and bilayer models is the orthorhombic distortion of the vortex\ncore in the bilayer model, not present in the single-layer calculation. The single-layer\nmodel exhibits the fourfold \"star\" shape, first described in [25], while the LDOS in the\nbilayer plane is stretched along the a-axis, perpendicular to the chains. We note that\nSTM experiments in YBa2 Cu3 O7\u2212\u03b4 found a similar stretching of the cores along the\na-axis, with a ratio of \u223c 1.5 between major and minor axes.[23] Although our results\nare suggestive, it is premature to declare the chains to be the underlying mechanism for\nthis anisotropy, especially given the number of unresolved discrepancies between theory\nand experiment. We return to this point below.\nWe can construct a qualitative argument for the anisotropy between the (1, 0)\nand (0, 1) directions in the dispersion of the inner peaks. The fact that these peaks\nasymptotically approach Es at large distances from the vortex core suggests that they\nare closely connected to superconductivity in the chain layer. We therefore consider the\nbehaviour of quasiparticles travelling at the chain Fermi velocity vF,c within a chain a\nperpendicular distance r\u22a5 from the vortex core. Since the direction along which the\nquasiparticle travels does not change as it moves along the chain, the quasiparticle\nangular momentum is conserved and is Lc = r\u22a5 vF,c . This is obviously an approximate\nstatement since a quasiparticle, as a result of chain-plane hybridization, spends a fraction\nof its time in the plane layer where its trajectory is altered by the magnetic field.\nThe linear relationship between r\u22a5 and Lc is therefore also approximate. However, it\nis sufficient to explain the anisotropy between (1, 0) and (0, 1) directions. We recall\nthat in conventional superconductors there is a linear relationship between the angular\nmomentum of a quasiparticle eigenstate and its energy.[29, 27] For the (1, 0) cut, r\u22a5 is\nequal to the distance r from the vortex core, Lc grows linearly with r, and the inner peaks\nare expected (by this argument) to disperse linearly with r. This prediction is consistent\nwith the numerical results shown in Figure 3. On the other hand, r\u22a5 = 0 everywhere\nalong the (0, 1) cut, since that cut follows along the chain that passes through the vortex\ncore. We therefore have Lc = 0 everywhere along this cut, and the inner peaks remain\nat \u03c9 = \u03b5F . Since the single-electron hopping between the chain and plane layers makes\nthe chain-derived states weakly 2D, Lc is only approximately conserved along the length\nof the chain. We therefore expect a very weak dispersion of the peak energies along the\n(0, 1) direction. Again, this simple argument is consistent with numerical results, shown\nin Figure 5.\nWe finish this section with a brief discussion of the relevance of this work to\nexperiments. There is a large body of literature attempting to explain STM experiments\nin HTS, both in zero magnetic field and in finite fields[23]. Existing theories are\nsuccessful at reproducing broad qualitative features of the DOS spectrum, but generally\nfail to correctly predict quantitative details such as the spatial dependence of the\nLDOS near isolated impurities or vortex cores. The same appears to be true of the\nwork discussed here: the proximity model is consistent with experiments indicating\nthe existence of a small superconducting gap scale Es \u2248 5 meV but, as with previous\n\n\fEffect of Chains on the LDOS in the Vortex Phase of YBCO\n\n14\n\ncalculations, there is a discrepancy between the experiments and theory regarding the\nspatial dependence of the LDOS. Whether the failure to explain experiments is an\nexperimental issue, or is due to unknown tunneling matrix element effects, surface states,\nor a failure of the basic mean-field model, is unclear at this stage.\nBecause of these uncertainties, we seek simple qualitative predictions stemming\nfrom the proximity model that might reveal something about the electronic structure\nof the vortex cores. We believe that one qualitative feature predicted by the proximity\nmodel, the existence of an anistropy in the low energy LDOS between the (1, 0) and\n(0, 1) directions, should hold regardless of the details of the model. An experiment to\nmeasure such an anisotropy would establish whether Es does, in fact, originate with the\nchains. In order to address this question, it will be necessary to perform experiments at\nstrong fields where the vortex lattice is square.\n4. Conclusions\nWe have studied the local density of states near a vortex core within a proximity model\nfor YBa2 Cu3 O7\u2212\u03b4 . This model incorporates both CuO2 planes and CuO chains. The\nproximity model predicts that the CuO chains introduce a set of dispersing peaks in\nthe LDOS, in addition to the peaks predicted for a single-layer superconductor. These\npeaks are associated with the small induced gap in the chain layer, and consequently\nhave a strongly anisotropic dispersion. At \u03c9 = \u03b5F , the LDOS is extended along the\nchain direction, but at \u03c9 > \u03b5F , the vortex cores appear stretched along the a-axis.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by NSERC of Canada.
