The possible forms of\ntrilinear couplings of the matter fields are determined by the Lie algebra of the microscopic\nsuper Yang\u2013Mills theory, and a detailed pattern of the Yukawa couplings follows from geometry. Compactifications of superstring theory, therefore, have a chance to be a framework for\nunderstanding of the flavor physics.\nIf one takes SU(5)GUT unification seriously,1 then one has to wonder what higher dimensional super Yang\u2013Mills theory would give rise to the up-type Yukawa couplings\n\u2206L = \u03bb(u) 10ab 10cd H(5)e \u01ebabcde .\n\n(1)\n\nThis contraction by \u01ebabcde arises from the structure constant of E6 Lie algebra and a E7,8 that\ncontains E6 . Heterotic E8 \u00d7 E8 string theory, M-theory and F-theory are the candidates for\nsuch a theoretical framework [1].\nIn M-theory compactifications on manifolds with G2 holonomy and in F-theory compactifications on elliptic fibered Calabi\u2013Yau 4-folds,the charged matter fields are localized in the\ninternal spaces. This localized picture of matter fields enables us to discuss the flavor pattern\nof Yukawa matrices in rather intuitive ways. Explanations for hierarchical eigenvalues [2] as\nwell as generation structures in the quark sector [3] have been achieved in phenomenological\nmodels by using higher-dimensional gauge theory with localized matter wavefunctions. An\nintuitive picture of localized matter fields and the mechanism of generating Yukawa couplings\nin M-theory compactifications has also been exploited in [1], to see that the up-type Yukawa\nmatrix in (1) tends to have suppressed diagonal entries in M-theory compactifications on\nmanifolds with G2 holonomy. That is not in very good agreement with the real world. It is\nalso worth studying flavor pattern of generic F-theory compactifications, exploiting the fact\nthat charged matter fields have localized wavefunctions.\n1\n\nquark doublets and lepton doublets belong to different irreducible representations\n\n1\n\n\fIt is by now known how many massless charged matter fields are in the low-energy spectrum, and how to determine their zero-mode wavefunctions, once a geometry for supersymmetric F-theory compactification is given [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. A prescription for how to calculate\nYukawa couplings for three charged matter fields in F-theory compactifications has also been\nwritten down [7, 6, 10, 9]. A field theory formulation capturing a certain sector of dynamical\ndegrees of freedom in F-theory [11, 6, 7] turns out to be very useful for this purpose [9].\nNevertheless, the Yukawa couplings involving only SU(5)GUT -charged matter fields do not\naccount for neutrino Yukawa couplings. In order to study flavor physics in the lepton sector,\nit is crucial that we have a theoretical formulation dealing with Yukawa couplings that involve\nneutral matter fields. Therefore, in this article, we develop the crucial issue of identifying the\n(SU(5)GUT -neutral) right-handed neutrinos in the F-theory compactifications. We develop\na general prescription of calculating the Yukawa couplings involving neutral fields, with a\ndirect application for neutrino Yukawa couplings.\nIn section 2, we will discuss a possibility that complex structure moduli of F-theory compactifications are identified with chiral multiplets of right-handed neutrinos. Those moduli\nfields acquire large masses in flux compactifications. A main result of our paper is that the\ntypical mass scale in flux compactifications, being below the GUT scale, is just about right\nfor the mass scale of the right-handed neutrinos predicted by experimental data.\nThe neutral fields of unified theories such as right-handed neutrinos are better captured\nin generic F-theory compactifications as moduli fields of Calabi\u2013Yau 4-fold compactifications.\nOn the other hand, field theory models for local geometry of Calabi\u2013Yau 4-folds are better\ntools in calculating Yukawa couplings such as neutrino Yukawa couplings, where both charged\nfields and these moduli fields are involved. We therefore explain in section 3 how to combine\nthe two descriptions of F-theory compactifications to calculate Yukawa couplings involving\nneutral fields. As a digression, we discuss the cubic term of a neutral field in the next-tominimal supersymmetric standard model in section 3.2.2.\nThe dimension-4 proton decay is a serious phenomenological problem in compactifications with low-energy supersymmetry. The absence of rapid proton decay implies that the\ncomplex structure moduli for our real world is somewhat special. Thus, right-handed neutrinos should be regarded as fluctuations of complex structure moduli from a special choice\nof complex structure moduli in our vacuum. In section 4, we present some scenarios solving the dimension-4 proton decay problem, and discuss the consequences in the physics of\nright-handed neutrinos.\nWe noticed that recent articles [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] cover similar subjects.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nSinglet Masses from Moduli Stabilization\n\nThe right-handed neutrinos N\u0304 are not charged under SU(5)GUT unification group, and they\nare supposed to have trilinear couplings\n(\u03bd)\n\n\u2206L = \u03bbij N\u0304i lj hu + h.c..\n\n(2)\n\nHere, lj are lepton doublets of the Standard Model, and hu the Higgs doublet. This is the\nonly certainty from phenomenology. Therefore, in string phenomenology, any light degrees\nof freedom that are neutral under SU(5)GUT are qualified to be considered right-handed\nneutrinos, as long as they have the coupling (2).\nNeutrino masses indicated by neutrino oscillation experiments are much smaller than the\nmass eigenvalues of the quarks and charged leptons of the Standard Model, this being a\nnatural prediction of the see-saw mechanism. If right-handed neutrinos have mass terms,\n\u2206L = Mii\u2032 N\u0304i N\u0304i\u2032 + h.c.,\n\n(3)\n\nwith the eigenvalues of Mii\u2032 much larger than the electroweak scale, then the Majorana masses\nof the left-handed neutrinos are generated, with their mass eigenvalues much smaller than\nthe electroweak scale. From the measured value \u2206m2 \u2243 2\u20133 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 of the atmospheric\nneutrino oscillation [18], one can conclude that the lightest right-handed neutrino is not\nheavier than about\n(v\u03bb(\u03bd) )2\n\u221a\n= (\u03bb(\u03bd) )2 \u00d7 (5.5\u20136.7) \u00d7 1014 GeV.\n(4)\n2\n\u2206m\nHere, v \u2243 174 GeV is the Higgs vacuum expectation value (vev). The neutrino Yukawa\ncouplings \u03bb(\u03bd) should not be much larger than unity, otherwise the perturbative field theory\ndescription would immediately become invalid because of the renormalization group flow of\nthe couplings \u03bb(\u03bd) . Thus, the mass scale of right-handed neutrinos is below the energy scale\nof gauge coupling unification MGUT \u223c 1016 GeV (simply called the GUT scale) with a safe\nmargin.\nWe will now address the issues:\n\u2022 What are the right-handed neutrinos in string phenomenology, and how many of them\nare there?\n\u2022 Where does the energy scale of the Majorana masses Mii\u2032 come from\n\u2022 Where do the neutrino Yukawa couplings (2) come from?\n\n3\n\n\f2.1\n\nComplex Structure Moduli as Right-Handed Neutrinos\n\nThe compactification of F-theory to N = 1 supersymmetry in 4-dimensions is described by a\nset of data, (X, G(4) ). X is a Calabi\u2013Yau 4-fold that is an elliptic fibration over a base 3-fold\nB3 :\n\u03c0X : X \u2192 B3 .\n(5)\nG(4) = dC (3) is a 4-form flux on X, and C (3) is the 3-form potential in the language of\neleven-dimensional supergravity. The 4-form flux G(4) has to take its value only in the (2,2)\ncomponent, and be primitive in order to leave an unbroken N = 1 supersymmetry [19]. This\nclass of compactifications has h3,1 complex structure moduli, h1,2 moduli associated with\nthe configuration of C (3) that is not reflected in the field strength G(4) = dC (3) , and K\u00e4hler\nmoduli chiral multiplets.\nThe complex structure moduli have interactions in the superpotential [20]\nZ\n\u03a9 \u2227 G(4) .\n(6)\n\u2206W = WGVW =\nX\n\nIn the absence of a flux G(4) on X, complex structure moduli parametrizing \u03a9 would have\nremained massless (in the absence of supersymmetry breaking). Once a generic flux G(4)\nis introduced, however, potential is generated for the moduli, and the complex structure of\nX dynamically sets itself to a minimum of the potential, so that G(4) has vanishing (1,3)\ncomponents. All the complex structure moduli generically have mass terms around such a\nminimum [21].\nWhen the Calabi\u2013Yau 4-fold X is given by an equation f = 0 on a space with a set of\nlocal coordinates (x1 , x2 , * * * , x5 ), then \u03a9 has an expression\n\u03a9 = Resf =0\n\ndx1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 dx5\ndx1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 dx4\n=\n= *** .\nf\n\u2202f /\u2202x5\n\n(7)\n\nCoefficients in the defining equation f = 0-collectively denoted by a-set the complex\nstructure of X. The vacuum choice \u03a9(a = a0 ) is a pure (4,0)-form when evaluated on a\nholomorphic coordinates corresponding to the vacuum value a = a0 . When \u03a9(a) is expanded\nin fluctuations from vacuum \u03b4a \u2261 a \u2212 a0 , \u03a9(a) at order O(\u03b4a) stays within H (4,0) (X; C) \u2295\nH (3,1) (X; C) with respect to the vacuum holomorphic coordinates at a = a0 [22]. This is why\nnon-vanishing flux G(4) in the (1,3)-component when evaluated at vacuum a = a0 would have\nmeant non-vanishing F-term vev h\u03b4W/\u03b4ai |a=a0 (and supersymmetry breaking). The 4-form\n\n4\n\n\f\u03a9(a) at order O((\u03b4a)2 ) remains within H (4,0) (X; C) \u2295 H (3,1) (X; C) \u2295 H (2,2) (X; C) evaluated\nthe vacuum complex structure, and is expressed as a sum of the form\nc\n\u03a9(a) = \u03a9(a0 ) + (ka \u03a9(a0 ) + \u03c7a ) (\u03b4a)a + (kab \u03a9(a0 ) + lab\n\u03c7c + \u03c8ab ) (\u03b4a)a (\u03b4a)b .\n\n(8)\n\nHere, \u03c7a 's are basis of H (3,1) (Xa=a0 ; C), and \u03c8ab elements of H (2,2) (Xa=a0 ; C). The Gukov\u2013\nVafa\u2013Witten superpotential with generic flux G(4) \u2208 H (2,2) (Xa=a0 ) gives rise to the nonvanishing mass terms (quadratic term)\n!\nZ\nZ\nWGVW =\n\nX\n\nh\u03a9i \u2227 G(4) +\n\nX|a=a0\n\n\u03c8ab \u2227 G(4)\n\n(\u03b4a)a (\u03b4a)b + * * *\n\n(9)\n\nfor the fluctuations of the complex structure moduli (\u03b4a).\nThis is a standard story of flux compactification and stabilization of complex structure\nmoduli in Type IIB string theory / F-theory. Now, as discussed at the beginning of this\nsection, any light degrees of freedom that are neutral under SU(5)GUT have a chance to\nbe identified with right-handed neutrinos. In this article the complex structure moduli are\nidentified with the right-handed neutrinos so the moduli masses from the flux compactification\nimmediately become the Majorana masses of right-handed neutrinos.\nNote that the need for right-handed neutrinos in the see-saw scenario does not motivate\nphenomenologically an unbroken SO(10) symmetry in the effective theory in 3+1 dimensions,\nor its realization on a stack of coincident branes. What used to be right-handed neutrinos in the spinor representation of SO(10) GUT just becomes neutral vector-bundle/braneconfiguration moduli of SU(5) GUT, as one can see immediately by following the Higgs\ncascade studied in [23, 24]. The idea of identifying right-handed neutrinos with vector bundle moduli in Heterotic string compactification with SU(5) GUT dates back (at least to our\nknowledge) to [25]. Under the duality between the Heterotic string and F-theory, all of vector\nbundle moduli and complex structure moduli in Heterotic string theory correspond to the\ncomplex structure moduli H 3,1 (X; C) (and H 1,2 (X; C), which we mention later) in F-theory\ncompactification [26, 27, 24, 28, 29]. Since the vector bundle moduli in Heterotic string theory\nhave the desired Yukawa couplings for neutrinos\n\u2206W = \u03bb 5\u0304 1 5,\n\n(10)\n\nwe expect that the complex structure moduli in F-theory also have (at least qualitatively) the\nsame interactions. Therefore, it is quite natural to identify the complex structure moduli with\n\n5\n\n\fright-handed neutrinos in F-theory compactification. Their Majorana masses are generated\nby the Gukov\u2013Vafa\u2013Witten superpotential, as discussed before.\nIn F-theory compactifications, the number of complex structure moduli, h3,1 (X), is usually\nmuch larger than three, the number of \"generations\" of SU(5)GUT -charged quarks and leptons.\nThis is not a contradiction from phenomenological perspectives. All we know for sure is that\nat least two right-handed neutrinos are necessary in order to account for all the data of\nneutrino oscillation experiments in the see-saw mechanism [30]. There is no upper bound\nfrom phenomenology on the number of right-handed neutrinos. In fact, there is even an\nindication [31] that the number of right-handed neutrinos may be much larger than just\nthree. Thus, a higher number of right-handed neutrinos possibly obtained from complex\nstructure moduli is not problematic at all, and may even be a blessing in disguise.\n\n2.2\n\nEstimation of the Majorana Mass Scale\n\nLet us now estimate the energy scale of the Majorana masses of right-handed neutrinos,\nassuming that the right-handed neutrinos are complex structure moduli, and that the Majorana masses derive from the superpotential (6, 9) in F-theory compactifications. We begin\nwith a review of a similar problem in Type IIB orientifold compactifications.\ne 2 , the comIn Type IIB string compactification on Calabi\u2013Yau orientifolds on B3 = B/Z\nplex structure moduli acquire masses mcs with an order of magnitude estimate given by\n[32]\n\"\n\u0012 \u00132 #2\nls\nm2cs \u223c m6KK ls4 = mKK \u00d7\n.\n(11)\nR6\ne for\nHere, mKK = 1/R6 is the \"Kaluza\u2013Klein scale\", assuming that the Calabi\u2013Yau 3-fold B\nan orientifold compactification of Type IIB string theory is almost isotropic and its radius\n\u221a\ncharacterized by a single parameter R6 . We define the string length ls as ls \u2261 (2\u03c0) \u03b1\u2032 .\nThis expression is understood as follows. The quantum fluctuations of the complex structure moduli fields correspond to (0, 2)-type fluctuations of the metric on the Calabi\u2013Yau\n3-fold.

Interestingly, the estimate (14) corresponds\nto a naive geometric mean of F (3) \u223c ls2 /R63 and gs\u22121 H (3) \u223c ls2 /(R63 gs ).\n3\nIn (12) and in all the rest of this article, all the lengths, volumes, Kaluza\u2013Klein scales etc. are measured\nwith a metric in the string frame. It is conventional in Type IIB orientifolds that the string frame metric g (S)\nand the Einstein frame metric g (E) in 10 dimensions are related by Weyl rescaling g (S) = e\u03c6/2 g (E) , where\nthe dilaton field \u03c6 includes both its vacuum value h\u03c6i = gs and fluctuation from the vev, (\u03c6 \u2212 h\u03c6i). All\nphysical observables M(d) with mass dimension d (except ls ) in string frame and Einstein frame are related\n2\n\n(S)\n\n\u2212d/4\n\nby M(d) = gs\n\n(E)\n\nM(d) . Thus, this dependence on the frame or convention of Weyl rescaling cancels as long as\n(E)\n\nwe talk of dimensionless ratios. (mcs /mKK )2 \u223c (ls /R6 )4 in (11) is expressed in terms of R6 in the Einstein\n(S)\nframe, and this is equivalent to (gs ls4 )/(R6 )4 , which is the same as (16).\n\n7\n\n\fe we just have complex structure moduli of X as a whole, and generically,\nconfiguration in B;\nall of these moduli are stabilized. The estimate (11) was obtained for Calabi\u2013Yau orientifold\ncompactifications of Type IIB string theory with D7-branes (but without D5-branes, O5planes), which is a special subclass of F-theory compactifications. It is not immediately clear\ne in a special subclass of F-theory\nwhether the result for the complex structure moduli of B\ncompactifications is readily applied for all the complex structure moduli of X of generic Ftheory compactification. We therefore perform an analysis separately in the following for\ngeneric F-theory compactifications.\nAn F-theory compactification on an elliptically fibered Calabi\u2013Yau 4-fold X is regarded\nas an M-theory compactification on the same X in the limit the volume of the elliptic fiber\nis zero. We use the supergravity language of M-theory compactifications, to estimate the\nmass scale of the complex structure moduli fields. Let us first remind ourselves of dictionary\nbetween parameters in the duality of M-theory compactification on T 2 and Type IIB string\ntheory on 10 dimensions. The T 2 compactification of 11-dimensional supergravity has two\ncompactification parameters \u03c1\u03b1 and \u03c1\u03b2 , the size of the two edges of T 2 , in addition to the\n9\nunique theoretical parameter l11\n\u2261 (4\u03c0)\u03ba211 appearing in the action of the 11-dimensional\nsupergravity. The T 2 compactification of the M-theory is dual to the Type IIB string theory\ncompactified on S 1 . The Type IIB string theory has two theoretical parameters ls and gs ,\nand one compactification parameter, the circumference R3 of the compact S 1 . The dictionary\nbetween the two descriptions is\ni\n\n1\n\u03c1\u03b2\n=i ,\ngs\n\u03c1\u03b1\n\nM\u22174 \u2261\n\n\u03c12\n1\n=\n,\n6\ngs ls4\nl11\n\nR3 =\n\nls2\nl3\n= 112 .\n\u03c1\u03b2\n\u03c1\n\n(17)\n\n\u221a\nwhere \u03c1 \u2261 \u03c1\u03b1 \u03c1\u03b2 . The F-theory limit corresponds to \u03c1 \u2192 0 and l11 \u2192 0 (relatively to the\n3\nKaluza\u2013Klein radius or to the horizon size of the universe), while keeping M\u22172 = \u03c1/l11\nfinite.\n2\nIn T -fibered compactification of 11-dimensional supergravity, the value of \u03c1\u03b2 /\u03c1\u03b1 may vary\nover the base manifold. In F-theory language, i/gs varies over the base space B3 . The two\ncombinations, M\u2217 and R3 , however, depend only on l11 and \u03c1, but not on \u03c1\u03b2 /\u03c1\u03b1 , and remain\nconstant over the base.\nWe now consider an M-theory compactification on a Calabi\u2013Yau 4-fold X that is an\nelliptic fibration \u03c0 : X \u2192 B3 on a 3-fold B3 . Let the typical size of the base B3 be R6 , and\nthat of the elliptic fiber be \u03c1. Then the effective action of the complex structure moduli of\nX in 3+1 dimensions is of the form\ni\nR66 \u03c12 h\n2\n(4) 2\nR3 \u2206L3+1 = \u2206L2+1 ;\n\u2206L2+1 \u223c 9 \u00d7 |\u2202\u03c6| \u2212 G\n\u00d7 fcn(\u03c6) .\n(18)\nl11\n8\n\n\f9\nThe overall factor R66 \u03c12 /l11\ncomes from integration over the real 8-dimensional manifold X,\nand R3 is factored out from \u2206L2+1 to obtain the effective action in the 3+1-dimensions.4 The\noverall factor, however, is irrelevant to the masses of the complex structure moduli fields \u03c6.\nThe value of the field strength is directly relevant to the mass scale of the moduli; G(4) is\n(4)\nthe typical value of the 4-form field strength GKLM N , which is of mass dimension 1 because\n(3)\nwe treat the 3-form potential field CLM N as dimensionless. As noted in [33], the field strength\nof the 4-form is typically of order\nl3\n(19)\nG(4) \u223c 114\nR8\n\nin Calabi\u2013Yau 4-fold compactification of M-theory; R8 is the typical size of the real 8dimensional manifold X. In F-theory compactifications that leave SO(3,1) unbroken Lorentz\nsymmetry, only a limited class of components of the 4-form field strength G(4) is allowed. The\nvacuum value of G(4) can be introduced only in components with one leg in the elliptic fiber,\nand the remaining three legs in the base B3 [34]. Therefore, we conclude that the moduli\nmasses are typically of order\nmcs \u223c G(4) \u223c\n\n3\nl11\n1\n\u223c 3 2,\n3\nR6 \u03c1\nR6 M\u2217\n\n(20)\n\nwhere we used the dictionary (17).5 This estimate turns out to be the same as the result\n(16) of the Type IIB Calabi\u2013Yau orientifolds.6\nTherefore, the Majorana masses of complex structure moduli (and hence of right-handed\nneutrinos) are in the energy scale just below Kaluza\u2013Klein scale 1/R6 , as we consider in\na regime where R6 is larger than the string length ls . The SU(5) GUT symmetry can be\nbroken by introducing U(1)Y flux on the locus of A4 \u2243 SU(5) singularity [10, 35, 36],7 in\nwhich case, the GUT scale is identified with the Kaluza\u2013Klein scale. Thus, the Majorana\nmasses of the right-handed neutrinos are typically somewhat below the GUT scale. This is a\nperfect agreement with the phenomenological requirement that the Majorana masses should\nbe below the GUT scale.\n4\n\n2\nThe overall factor in the effective action in 3+1 dimensions becomes R66 M\u22178 \u223c MPl\n, and remains finite.\n4\n3\n3\nIn the estimation (20), there is no strong argument for taking R8 \u223c R6 \u03c1\u03b1 , \u223c R6 \u03c1\u03b2 or \u223c R63 \u03c1. Thus, the\n+1/2\n\u22121/2\nestimate (20) contains an uncertainty at least of order gs\n\u2013gs\n. In generic F-theory compactifications,\nhowever, the value of gs varies over B3 , and cannot stay much larger or less than unity over the entire B3 ,\nbecause of the non-trivial SL(2, Z) monodromy. It will be smaller than unity in some region of B3 , and will\nbe larger in other. Thus, despite the uncertainty and varying value of gs , it will be safe to infer conclude\nthat some of complex structure moduli will have masses below the mass scale (20).\n6\nThere is no extra gs dependence in the Type IIB Calabi\u2013Yau orientifolds.\n7\nSee [37, 38] for Type IIB versions.\n5\n\n9\n\n\fLet us refine the estimate of the mass scale a bit more, by making a distinction between\nthe Kaluza\u2013Klein scale and the GUT scale.

Thus, the energy scale\nof gauge coupling unification MGUT should roughly be the same as 1/RGUT , but they can be\ndifferent, for example by a factor c = 2\u03c0 in case S = T 4 . The numerical coefficient c can be\nregarded as a factor of order unity in general, ranging in between c \u223c (1\u20132\u03c0). We assumed\nthat there are no extra SU(5)GUT -charged particles much below the unification scale other\nthan the particles in the minimal supersymmetric standard model; otherwise, the value of\n\u03b1GUT should be a little larger. One should also note that the value of MGUT is accompanied\nby uncertainty of the half order of magnitude or so, coming from unknown tree-level and\n1-loop threshold corrections.10 The three observables \u03b1GUT , MGUT and MPl are expressed in\nterms of the same number of fundamental parameters M\u2217 , RGUT and R6 in (21\u201323). Thus,\nthe values of these parameters can be determined from the values of the observables in our\nworld, which are also given in (21\u201323).\n\u221a\n2\nThe reduced Planck scale is defined as the coefficient in the Einstein\u2013Hilbert term L = (MPl\n/2) \u221a\u2212gR +\n* * * in the effective action in the 3+1 dimensions.

This hierarchy has little to do\nwith a moderately small parameter \u01eb = (RGUT /R6 )3 , which directly\nparametrizes the degree of \"decoupling\".\n\u221a\nIt is therefore misleading to take the small value of MGUT GN \u2243 10\u22123 as an indication of \"decoupling\".\nUnlike in the original context of decoupling [42] where a large hierarchy between the electroweak scale and\nthe Planck scale was discussed, the hierarchy under consideration here is not that large, and most of this\nhierarchy is accounted for by the first factor of (24).\n\n11\n\n\f2\nsingularity locus S and a real 2-dimensional space, like in Figure 1 (b), R63 = RGUT\nR\u22a5 , and\n\u03b3=1\n(4)\none finds that RGUT /R\u22a5 = \u01eb\n[10].

As we consider the F-theory limit with \u03c1 \u2192 0 and l11 \u2192 0 (while keeping l11\n/\u03c1\nfinite), there are only three relevant parameters. From these three parameters, six observable\nparameters12 can be derived: MPl , \u03b1GUT , the energy scale of gauge coupling unification MGUT ,\nright-handed neutrino masses MR = mcs from flux compactification, Kaluza\u2013Klein scale of\nbulk modes MKK (1/R6 or 1/R\u22a5 ), and the energy scale Mstr \u223c 1/ls where stringy excitations\nappear. The last two of them, though, may not be practically observable, except that those\nmass scales may set some limitations on inflation models in F-theory compactifications. We\nhave determined all the three relevant fundamental parameters R6 , RGUT and M\u2217 in (21\u201323)\nby using the known value of the three observable parameters MGUT , \u03b1GUT and MPl , and\nthen the value of the remaining one observable MR = mcs is predicted by (20). Although\nits upper bound has been indicated phenomenologically by the observed value of \u2206m2 in\nneutrino oscillation, its value is theoretically independent of the GUT scale or Kaluza\u2013Klein\nscale in effective field theory in general (except in individual models). In generic F-theory\ncompactifications with fluxes, however, an upper bound of the energy scale of right-handed\nneutrinos is predicted, and what is more, the prediction implies that the phenomenological\nupper bound is fortunately satisfied.\n\n3\n\nYukawa Couplings Involving Singlets\n\nNow that we have seen the complex structure moduli of F-theory compactifications are good\ncandidates for the right-handed neutrinos, let us study how we should compute their Yukawa\ncouplings.\n12\n\nIf the fundamental parameters \u03c1 and l11 are kept small but non-zero, then there is another observable\nparameter, the S 1 radius R3 /(2\u03c0) of the compactification of this 3+1 dimensional \"Minkowski\" space. Thus,\nthe parameter counting argument for predictability in the following does not change.\n\n12\n\n\fYukawa couplings of quarks and charged leptons are trilinear interactions where all the\nthree fields are charged under the GUT gauge group SU(5)GUT . Such charged matter fields\nare associated with rank-1 enhancement of singularity [24, 11], and the Yukawa couplings\nwith rank-2 enhancement [7, 6, 8, 9]. In the absence of microscopic formulation of F-theory,\nit would not be practical to study such Yukawa couplings by using the singular geometry of\nX. Instead, the field theory formulation of [11, 6, 7] provides an approximate description\nof local geometry of X, whether X is singular or not. Such field theory local models13 were\nused to study the Yukawa couplings of charged matter fields [10, 43, 9].\nNeutrino Yukawa couplings (2, 10), on the other hand, involve two SU(5)GUT -charged\nfields and one SU(5)GUT -neutral field. Such trilinear couplings also appear in the next-tominimal supersymmetric standard model (NMSSM), \u2206W = \u03bb SHu Hd . SU(5)GUT -neutral\nfields are, in general, identified with moduli of Calabi\u2013Yau 4-fold X, say, H 3,1 (X; C) or\nH 1,2(X; C). As the field theory formulation has been very useful in studying Yukawa couplings, we will study in the following the way to include the moduli fields of Calabi\u2013Yau\n4-fold in the field theory language.14\n\n3.1\n\nCapturing the Moduli Fields in the Field Theory Formulation\n\nSuppose that a local geometry of X is given by an Weierstrass equation\ny 2 = x3 + xf (z, u, v) + g(z, u, v),\n\n(28)\n\nwhere (x, y) are the coordinates of the elliptic fiber, (u, v) are local coordinates of a divisor\nS in B3 , and z a normal coordinate of S in B3 . Let us further assume that the surface\nwith (x, y, z) coordinates have A4 singularity at z = 0. S is identified with the locus of A4\nsingularity. Four vanishing 2-cycles CA (A = 1, 2, 3, 4) are in the (x, y, z) plane, and have\nintersection form that is negative of the Cartan matrix of A4 . That is the local condition for\nthe SU(5)GUT theories.\nLet us focus on a local region of S. Through a projection (x, y, z, u, v) 7\u2192 (u, v), X is\nnow regarded locally as a fibration over S. By focusing further on a region of X near the A4\nsingularity locus, the geometry of X in this local region may be regarded approximately as\n13\n\nIn this article, as in [9], we mean by a \"field theory local model\" a field theory that models a local\ngeometry of X; to be more precise, that is a field theory on a local patch U of (A4 -)singularity locus S that\nprovides an approximate description of physics associated with local geometry of X containing U \u2282 S \u2282 X.\nThus, the \"local model\" does not imply local geometry of X along the entire S that models the physics of\nvisible elementary particles or engineering of the Standard Model.\n14\nThis study has been initiated by [6], but we will extend the results in [6].\n\n13\n\n\fan ALE fibration on S, with non-vanishing 2-cycles CP and the vanishing 2-cycles CA . When\nthe intersection form of the space spanned by CA and CP is that of negative of Cartan matrix\nof Lie algebra g, then a field theory local model can be constructed for this local region of X,\nwith the gauge group G [6, 7]. The structure group of a Higgs bundle on S has a structure\ngroup G\u2032 , which is the commutant of the unbroken symmetry group G\u2032\u2032 = SU(5)GUT in G. See\n[9, 12] for the use of Higgs bundle in F-theory compactifications; references on mathematics\nof Higgs bundle are also provided there.\n3.1.1\n\nDetermination of the Field Theory Background\n\nThe compactification data (X, G(4) ) are encoded in the 4-form15 \u03a9\n\u03a9(a) =\n\ndx \u2227 dz \u2227 du \u2227 dv\ndx \u2227 dz \u2227 du \u2227 dv\n= p\n,\ny\nx3 + xf + g\n\n(29)\n\nand the 3-form potential C (3) on X. Here, a collective denotes the coefficients in the defining\nequation (28). Using the (Poincare dual of the) 2-cycles CA and CP in the fiber direction,\n\u03a9(a) and C (3) can be expanded as\nX\n\u03a9(a) =\nC P \u2297 \u03c6P + * * * ,\n(30)\nP\n\nC\n\n(3)\n\n=\n\nX\nP\n\nCP \u2297 AP + * * * ,\n\n(31)\n\nwhere ellipses stand for a linear combination running over non-compact 2-cycles. Coefficients\nfor the 2-cycles CA should be dropped for a background configuration (\u03a9(a0 ), C (3) ), because we want to preserve the G\u2032\u2032 = SU(5)GUT symmetry.16 A background configuration\n(\u03a9(a0 ), C (3) ) therefore determines (h\u2032 \u2297 C)-valued (2,0)-form \u03c6(a0 ) and h\u2032 -valued 1-form\nhAi; here, h\u2032 is the Cartan subalgebra of the structure group g\u2032 .\nIt will be useful to have some specific examples in mind. In F-theory compactifications\nwith Heterotic dual, X \u2192 S can be regarded as a K3-fibration globally over S. The K3-fiber\nhas 22 topological 2-cycles, 8 of which have intersection form that is the negative of the\nCartan matrix of E8 . We can choose a basis CA (A = 1, 2, 3, 4) and CP (P = 8\u0303, 6, 7, \u2212\u03b8), so\nthat their intersection form is described by the Dynkin diagram in Figure 2. G\u2032\u2032 = SU(5)GUT\n15\n\nThe coefficient of du \u2227 dv transforms like a section of O(KS ), because dx/y transforms as sections of\n\u22121\nO(KB3 ) = O(KS ) \u2297 NS|B\n, and dz as those of NS|B3 .\n3\n16\n(3)\nC\ncan be introduced in the CA components as well, in order to break the SU(5)GUT symmetry to\nthe Standard Model gauge symmetry.\n\n14\n\n\fFigure 2: An extended Dynkin diagram of E8 . We follow the conventions of [8].\n\nis generated by CA 's, and the structure group G\u2032 = SU(5)str by CP 's. When the complex\nstructure of X is in the stable degeneration limit, the size of all the CP 's is small relatively\nto all other 2-cycles in the K3 fiber, and a field theory model with G = E8 gauge group with\nan G\u2032 = SU(5)str Higgs bundle given by (\u03c6P (a0 ), hAiP ) provides a good approximation to\nsome parts of physics in the F-theory compactification by (X, G(4) ). In this case, the E8 field\ntheory model with an G\u2032 = SU(5)str Higgs bundle is defined globally on S, not just in a local\npatch of S. The (2,0)-form field background \u03c6P in su(5)str \u2297 C becomes\nh\u03c6i = \u03c6(a0 ) = diag(\u2212\u03c68\u0303 , \u03c68\u0303 \u2212 \u03c66 , \u03c66 \u2212 \u03c67 , \u03c67 \u2212 \u03c6\u2212\u03b8 , \u03c6\u2212\u03b8 )(a0 )\n\n(32)\n\nin the fundamental (SU(5)str -5) representation. This is the background configuration of the\n(2,0)-form field in the field theory on S \u00d7 R3,1 [6].\nAnother example is a case where local geometry of X is approximately given by\ny 2 \u2243 x2 + z 5 (z 2 + 2uz + v),\n\n(33)\n\nafter dropping higher order terms in local coordinates (u, v, z, x, y). The degree-7 polynomial\nQ\nin z can be locally expressed as i=1,*** ,5,6,7 (z \u2212zi ), with zi = 0 (i = 1, * * * 5), z6 = z\u2212 , z7 = z+ ,\nand\n\u221a\nz\u00b1 (u, v) = \u2212u \u00b1 u2 \u2212 v.\n(34)\n\nWe take the 2-cycles CI (I = 1, * * * , 6) as S 1 -fibrations over intervals from z = zI to z = zI+1 .\nThe intersection form of CI 's is negative of Cartan matrix of A6 , and hence the gauge group\nof the field theory model for this local geometry is G = SU(7). CA (A = 1, 2, 3, 4) have\nvanishing size, whereas the others C5,6 have non-vanishing sizes, and hence G\u2032\u2032 = SU(5)GUT\ngenerated by CA 's is the unbroken symmetry, and the structure group is G\u2032 = SU(2) \u00d7 U(1).\nThe period integral over these 2-cycles determine the (2,0)-form field backgrounds \u03c6P (a0 ).\nThe period integral over the 2-cycles CI can be carried out explicitly, and\nZ\n\u03a9 = \u22122\u03c0i(zI+1 \u2212 zI ) du \u2227 dv.\n(35)\nCI\n\n15\n\n\fThe background (2,0)-form configuration [9]\n5\n\nz }| {\n\u03c6(a0 ) = 2\u03c0i diag(0, * * * , 0, z\u2212 (u, v), z+ (u, v)) du \u2227 dv\n\n(36)\n\nreproduces the period integral above for positive roots CI 's.\nWe have provided an explicit procedure of obtaining (\u03c6, A) background for a given set\nof data (X, G(4) ). Although the dictionary between the deformation of ADE singularity and\nCartan vev of \u03c6 has been known in principle, some ambiguity remained . The deformation\nparameters of ADE singularity are certainly identified with (h \u2297C)/W , where h is the Cartan\nsubalgebra of the corresponding ADE Lie algebra, and W its Weyl group, but the dictionary\nstill has an overall scaling ambiguity [44]. The overall scaling ambiguity comes in at each\npoint (u, v) in the base. There is a discrepancy between the choice of \u03c6 in [9] and one in\n[45], and it comes exactly from the point-wise overall scaling ambiguity (see the appendix for\nmore). The explicit procedure above, which uses the period integral, fixes this ambiguity.\nEnhancing the rank of the gauge group by 1 is the minimal choice of the field theory local\nmodels for regions along matter curves,but the gauge group should be chosen at least by\nrank-2 higher for regions containing codimension-3 singularities where singularity types are\nenhanced by rank-2. These choices are minimal, and one can choose larger gauge groups of\nthe field theory model larger, by maintaining higher order terms in the local defining equation\nof the geometry. It is a matter of the level of approximation how many higher order terms\nare taken into account.\nIn the two examples above, we set the background \u03c6 field configuration in the diagonal\nentries, fixing all the gauge transformation non-commuting with h\u03c6i. The gauge symmetry\nof the field theory local models remains (when \u03c6 is set diagonal) only in the SU(5)GUT\nsubgroup (and some U(1) factors for now). Since all other gauge degrees of freedom were\nredundant from the beginning, and were even absent in the Calabi\u2013Yau 4-fold description of\nF-theory compactification, we never need to introduce such gauge degrees of freedom in any\ndescriptions.\n3.1.2\n\nModuli (Massless) Fluctuations\n\nAlthough we have so far only talked about the vacuum configuration \u03c6P (a0 ) = \u03c6P in\n(32, 36), the same process defines a set of corresponding \u03c6P (a) for any deformed complex\nstructure moduli a = \u03b4a + a0 (where \u03b4a need not be infinitesimal). Because of the procedure\nabove, the resulting \u03c6P (a)'s determines a field configuration \u03c6(a)-a (2,0)-form on S-taking\n\n16\n\n\fits value in the Cartan part of the structure group G\u2032 . Thus, the deformation of the complex\nstructure of X of an F-theory compactification, a, corresponds to those of (2,0)-form \u03c6 on S\nin the Cartan part of G\u2032 \u2282 G, not the entire G\u2032 -adj. representation. Similarly, (31) defines\na Cartan-valued 1-form field A.\nThis may seem odd at first sight, because bosonic fields (A, \u03c6) and fermionic fields (\u03b7, \u03c8, \u03c7)\nare introduced for all the roots of the gauge group G, except for the first component in the\ndecomposition\n(37)\nResG\nhG\u2032 i\u00d7G\u2032\u2032 G-adj. \u2192 (adj., 1) + (1, adj.) + \u2295i (Ui , Ri ).\nIn the (adj., 1) component, only the Cartan part was restored from metric and 3-form potential by the reduction procedure (30, 31). The entire dynamical fields other than those in\nthe Cartan part are missing. This is not surprising, however, because only the Cartan part\nis obtained by dimensional reduction of metric and C (3) in geometric engineering of an ADE\ngauge group, and all other dynamical degrees of freedom for the roots of the ADE gauge\ngroup originate from M2-branes wrapping on vanishing topological 2-cycles. \"W-bosons\"\ncorresponding to blown-up/deformed 2-cycles become massive, and can be integrated out of\nan effective theory. Since all the h\u03c6i eigenvalues (e.g. in (32, 36)) in g\u2032 are different generically, all the 2-cycles for the roots in G\u2032 -adj. are blown up, and the corresponding fields\nbecome massive. In the field theory language, this is understood as Higgs mechanism by the\nHiggs vev hadj.(\u03c6)i. Thus, apart from a neighborhood of branch loci, where two eigenvalues\nof h\u03c6i become degenerate, we do not need to keep the dynamical fields for the roots of g\u2032 in\nan effective theory on S.\nThe BPS condition for the field configuration is [7]17\n|\u03b1|2\n\u03c9\u2227F \u2212\n[\u03c6, \u03c6] = 0,\nF (0,2) = 0,\n\u2202 \u0304A \u03c6 = 0,\n(38)\n2\nand zero-mode equations are obtained by imposing the same set of conditions for the background field configuration (hAim\u0304 , h\u03c6i) plus infinitesimal deformation (\u03c8m\u0304 , \u03c7). This is applied\nto any irreducible components in (37), and the (adj., 1) component is not an exception. The\nzero mode equations for the Cartan part of (adj., 1) are\n\u03c9 \u2227 d\u03c8 tot = 0,\n\n \u0304 = 0,\n\u2202\u03c8\n\n \u0304 = 0.\n\u2202\u03c7\n\n(39)\n\nHere, d = \u2202 + \u2202 \u0304 and \u03c8 tot is a 1-form \u03c8 + \u03c8\u0304. We understand that hAi(0,1)/(1,0) , h\u03c6i and h\u03c6i\ncan be made diagonal at generic points on S (other than at branch loci) which lead to the\n17\n\nSee [9] for details of the conventions. \u03b1 \u2208 C is a coefficient associated with the ambiguity in the\nnormalization of \u03c6 field.\n\n17\n\n\fsimplification of the zero-mode equation. These equations tell us that the fluctuations in\n\u03c7 = \u03b4\u03c6 and \u03c8 = \u03b4A(0,1) can be chosen independently. Furthermore, remembering that there\nis a monodromy around branch loci, and that fields are twisted by the Weyl group of G\u2032\n[9], the Cartan-valued fields (which means that there are rank-g\u2032 components) \u03c8 and \u03c7 on S\nare better understood as single-valued fields \u03c8 and \u03c7 on a spectral surface CV of a certain\nrepresentation.18 Thus, the zero-mode equations (39) implies that the zero modes from the\n(adj., 1) sector are characterized as\n\u03c7 = \u03b4\u03c6 \u2208 H 0 (CV ; KCV ),\n\nand \u03c8 = \u03b4A(0,1) \u2208 H 0,1(CV ; C) \u2243 H 1 (CV ; OCV ),\n\n(40)\n\nbecause \u03c7 is a holomorphic (2,0)-form, and \u03c8 tot a harmonic 1-form. Note the argument so\nfar does not provide justification for the holomorphicity of \u03c7 or harmonic nature of \u03c8 at\nthe ramification locus19 of the spectral surface CV over S, as the eigenvalues of h\u03c6i have\nbeen assumed to be non-degenerate so far. Thus, the characterization of the moduli (40)\nshould not be regarded as something derived already in the field theory formulation of Ftheory. But (40) is the same as the characterization of vector bundle moduli in Heterotic\nstring compactification: moduli of the spectral surface and Wilson lines on the spectral\nsurface.20 Thus, we consider that the argument above as quite reasonable. In short, moduli\ncharacterized as H 3,1 (X; C) globally in X are captured as H 0 (CV ; KCV ) in local models, and\nthe H 1,2 (X; C) moduli in global picture are treated as H 1 (CV ; C) in field theory local models.\nLet us digress for a moment to provide a little mathematical characterization of the moduli\nfields (40) as a whole. The following observation is theoretically interesting on its own, but\nit also turns out to be useful later in this article in understanding the moduli zero modes in\na limit of complex structure where the spectral surface CV is singular. Let us first note this\nrelation:\n0 \u2192 H 1 (CV ; OCV ) \u2192 Ext1 (iCV \u2217 O, iCV \u2217 O) \u2192 H 0 (CV ; KCV ) \u2192 H 2 (CV ; OCV ),\n18\n\n(41)\n\nWhen we are referring to matter curves, Higgs/vector bundles, spectral surfaces and other things associated with an irreducible component (Ui , Ri ), it is sometimes convenient to use Ri as a label, but Ui is more\nuseful in other situations. We therefore introduce the following convention in this article: when a representation of the unbroken symmetry is used as a subscript, we put it as |(Ri ) , but when we use a representation\nof the structure group, the subscript becomes just |Ui .\n19\nTo our knowledge, configuration of \u03c6, \u03c6 and gauge fields A(0,1)/(1,0) around the ramification locus has\nnot been discussed in sufficient details in the literature so far.\n20\nA slight difference is, though, that only a subspace of the moduli of the spectral surface is actually\nthe moduli of the vector bundle in Heterotic string theory; the subspace is characterized as the kernel of\nH 0 (S; R1 \u03c0\u2217 adV ) \u2192 H 2 (S; R0 \u03c0\u2217 adV ). We have not figured out where this discrepancy comes from. We will\ncome back to this issue shortly.\n\n18\n\n\fwhere iCV : CV \u0592\u2192 KS , and KS is the total space of the canonical bundle KS of S. See\n[46, 47] for an almost similar discussion in Type IIB language. The extension group picks\nup only the kernel of the last map from the moduli of the spectral surface H 0 (CV ; KCV ),\njust as in the Heterotic dual. Thus, the extension group above can be regarded as the\ncharacterization of the moduli fields. Since it does not matter if we replace both of OCV 's in\nExt1 (iCV \u2217 OCV , iCV \u2217 OCV ) by a line bundle on CV simultaneously, we take\n(adj., 1) :\n\nExt1 (iCV \u2217 NV , iCV \u2217 NV )\n\n(42)\n\nas the characterization of the moduli fields. V \u2261 iCV \u2217 NV is the Higgs sheaf21 of the F-theory\ncompactification.\nThe characterization of the massless modes from the (adj., 1) component (42) goes completely in parallel with those of charged matter fields [6, 7, 8, 9]\n(1, adj.) :\n(Ui , Ri ) :\n\nExt1 (i\u03c3\u2217 L, i\u03c3\u2217 L),\n\nExt1 (i\u03c3\u2217 \u03c1\u00d7\nRi (L), iCUi \u2217 NUi ).\n\n(43)\n(44)\n\nAll of these matter fields are described by extension groups in KS , and now so is the moduli\nfields in the (adj., 1) component. All of these zero-modes are given interpretations as if they\nwere matters arising from intersection of a pair of D7-branes, although completely generic\nF-theory compactifications are being discussed here.\nIt is true at the moment that (42) is nothing more than (40). One should note, however,\nthat we have arrived at (40) by assuming implicitly that the spectral surface is smooth. When\nthe spectral surface becomes singular, it is not that the zero modes split into fluctuations\nof \u03c6 and those of Am\u0304 . The expression (42), however, still remains an appropriate way to\ncharacterize the moduli zero modes, as we will see some examples in section 4. The expression\n(42) also makes it possible to understand the Yukawa couplings of H 1,2 (X; C) zero modes\nand H 3,1 (X; C) zero modes in an \"unified\" way, as we see shortly.\n\n3.2\n3.2.1\n\nYukawa Couplings involving Singlets\nNeutral-Charged-Charged Yukawa Couplings\n\nNow that we have understood how to deal with the moduli fields of Calabi\u2013Yau 4-fold compactification within the field theory local models of [11, 6, 7, 9], we can use the field theory\n21\n\nSee [9, 12] for the use of Higgs sheaf in F-theory compactifications. The notion of Higgs sheaf was already\nintroduced to physics in the context of Type IIB compactifications [47, 48].\n\n19\n\n\flocal models to study the Yukawa couplings involving the moduli fields.

Neutrino\nYukawa couplings and the SHu Hd interaction of the next-to-minimal theory are in this form.\nThe SU(5)GUT singlet field in the Yukawa couplings (10) may be fluctuations from the\nvacuum in H 1,2 (X; C), or in H 3,1 (X; C). In the former case, the Yukawa coupling \u03bb is\ncalculated by an overlap integration\nZ\n\u0001\n\u03bb \u223c 2 tr \u03c7U \u2227 \u03c8adj.(U ) \u2227 \u03c8U ,\n(47)\nS\n\nwhere (\u03c8U , \u03c7U ) is the zero mode wavefunction for a massless chiral multiplet from the (U, 5\u0304)\nirreducible component of G\u2032 \u00d7SU(5)GUT , and (\u03c8U , \u03c7U ) is for the (U, 5) irreducible component.\n\u03c8adj.(U ) is the wavefunction for the (adj., 1) component. In local models with gauge group\nG = SU(6), for example, U is a line bundle whose structure group is the commutant of\nSU(5)GUT within this G = SU(6) (possibly along with U(1)Y ). When a local model with\nG = E8 is chosen, then U = \u22272 5. The zero mode wavefunctions satisfy a relation (\u03c8U , \u03c7U ) =\n(\u2212\u03c8U , \u03c7U ) (e.g., [9]) when we make an approximation that the 4-form flux is ignored,24 and\nhence the factor 2 follows. Unless the singlet wavefunction \u03c8adj.(U ) is always pointing towards\nthe normal direction of the matter curve of SU(5)GUT -5 + 5\u0304 representations, this trilinear\ncoupling does not vanish. This overlap integration has contributions from everywhere along\nthe matter curve c\u0304(5\u0304) .\n22\nThis superpotential can be regarded as a non-Abelian extension of the Gukov\u2013Vafa\u2013Witten superpotential (6).\n23\nWe did not pay attention to the overall normalization of the superpotential (6, 46, 115), or in the reduction\n(30, 31). Reference [49] may be useful when determining the superpotential.\n24\nThis is a good approximation in the large Kaluza\u2013Klein radius limit.\n\n20\n\n\fThe overlap integration (47) is carried out over the surface S, but there might be an\nalternative expression where the overlap integration is done over the matter curve. Note that\nthe matter fields in the SU(5)GUT -5 and 5\u0304 representations are characterized by [6, 7, 8]\n1/2\n\n1/2\n\nf(5) \u2208 H 0 (c\u0304 \u0303(5\u0304) ; L\u22121\n\u2297 Kc\u0304 \u0303 ),\n(5\u0304)\n\nf(5\u0304) \u2208 H 0 (c\u0304 \u0303(5\u0304) ; L(5\u0304) \u2297 Kc\u0304 \u0303 ),\n\n(5\u0304)\n\n(5\u0304)\n\n(48)\n\nand hence f(5) * f(5\u0304) is in H 0 (c\u0304 \u0303(5\u0304) ; Kc\u0304 \u0303(5\u0304) ); here, L(5\u0304) is a line bundle for the fields in 5\u0304 repreeU ; C) on C\neU also\nsentation, coming from the C (3) potential.

Although we have not shown that (47) is the same as\nthe new expression (49), it they are the same, the latter expression will allow us to short-cut\nthe process of calculation, and to save time in computing the wavefunctions (\u03c8U , \u03c7U ) from\nf(5\u0304) and carrying out overlap integration on S numerically.\nChanging the vev of C (3) on X infinitesimally by H 1,2 (X; C) corresponds to turning on an\ninfinitesimally small vev in the SU(5)GUT singlet chiral multiplets 1's in the Yukawa couplings\n(10). Thus, if a pair of vector-like 5+5\u0304 states are in the low-energy spectrum, and if they\nhave a Yukawa coupling with a H 1,2 (X; C) moduli, then the vev of C (3) is chosen in our\nvacuum is such that the 5+5\u0304 pair happens to appear in the low-energy spectrum.\nYukawa couplings of the form (10) with a singlet from H 3,1 (X; C), on the other hand, are\ncalculated by an overlap integral25\nZ\n\u0001\n\u03bb = \u22122 tr \u03c8U \u2227 \u03c7adj.(U ) \u2227 \u03c8U .\n(50)\nS\n\nThe (0,1)-form valued wavefunctions \u03c8U and \u03c8U differ only by a phase (\u22121) in the approximation of ignoring the 4-form fluxes. Thus, the overlap integration vanishes at the level\nof this approximation. The Yukawa couplings of this type may, therefore, be suppressed at\nleast by some positive powers of a ratio (ls /RGUT ) < 1.

At quantitative level, however,\nthe mixing terms may still be loop-suppressed.\n\n21\n\n\fconsideration here correspond to the deformation of spectral surface in Heterotic dual, and it\nwas shown in [50] that this type of singlets has a Yukawa coupling with 5\u20135\u0304 pairs in Heterotic\ncompactifications, so that the deformation of the spectral surface change the number of massless states. It is hard to believe that the same couplings vanish in F-theory compactifications.\nThis overlap integration in F-theory description is not necessarily localized at codimension-3\nsingularity points either.\nThe neutral-charged-charged Yukawa couplings (47) and (50) are given an alternative\nexpression. A product\nExt1 (i\u03c3\u2217 OS , iCU \u2217 NU ) \u00d7 Ext1 (iCU \u2217 NU , iCU \u2217 NU ) \u00d7 Ext1 (iCU \u2217 NU , i\u03c3\u2217 OS ) \u2192 Ext3 (i\u03c3\u2217 OS , i\u03c3\u2217 OS )\n(51)\n0\n3,1\n1\n1,2\nis well-defined, and here, both H (CU ; KCU ) (H (X; C)) moduli and H (CU ; C) (H (X; C))\nare treated at once. Because\nExt3 (i\u03c3\u2217 OS , i\u03c3\u2217 OS ) \u2243 H 2 (S; KS ) = H 2,2(S; C) \u2243 C,\n\n(52)\n\nthe product above returns a complex number.\n3.2.2\n\nTrilinear Yukawa Couplings among Neutral Fields\n\nIt is also of phenomenological interest whether the singlet chiral multiplet S of the next-tominimal supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) has trilinear coupling \u2206W = \u03ba S 3 or\nnot. If this coupling is of order unity, then that is an ordinary NMSSM. If it is small, then\nan accidental U(1) global Peccei\u2013Quinn symmetry exists, and there exists a light pseudo\nGoldstone boson in the spectrum [51]. The Higgs mass bound from the LEP experiment is\nrelaxed in the presence of such a pseudo Goldstone boson, and the Higgs detection strategy\nat the LHC should be may also have to be different [52]. Such a light boson may also be\nrelevant to some cosmic ray signals [53].\nFollowing the arguments above, we consider the H 1,2 (X; C) moduli and H 3,1 (X; C) moduli\nas the candidates for such a singlet field S. If S is a H 3,1 (X; C) moduli, then such trilinear\ncouplings may appear from the cubic term of (\u03b4a) in the expansion in (9); the 4-form \u03a9(a =\n\u03b4a + a0 ) up to the order of (\u03b4a)3 remains within H 4,0 (X; C) \u2295 H 3,1 (X; C) \u2295 H 2,2 (X; C) \u2295\nH 1,3(X; C) in the vacuum complex structure, and can be expressed as\n\u0001\nd\n\u03a9(a) = \u03a9(a0 ) + * * * + (kabc \u03a9(a0 ) + labc\n\u03c7d + \u03c8\u0303abc +  \u0303labc;d \u03c7\u0303d )(\u03b4a)a (\u03b4a)b (\u03b4a)c + O (\u03b4a)4 , (53)\nwhere \u03c8\u0303abc \u2208 H 2,2 (Xa=a0 ; C), \u03c7\u0303d form a basis of H 1,3 (X|a=a0 ; C), and ellipses stand for the\nterms in (8) that are linear or quadratic in the fluctuations in the complex structure moduli\n\n22\n\n\f(\u03b4a). The trilinear coupling for the chiral multiplets Sa corresponding to (\u03b4a)a is given by\nZ\n\u2206W = \u03bbabc Sa Sb Sc ;\n\u03bbabc =\n\u03c8\u0303abc \u2227 G(4) .\n(54)\nX\n\nGenerically, this coupling does not vanish. It should be reminded, though, that the moduli\nfields from H 3,1 (X; C) generically obtain masses in the presence of 4-form fluxes, and the\nenergy scale of their masses in section 2 is quite large. Without a special reason, such moduli\nfields are not expected to appear at low energy scale such as the electroweak scale.\nIf the singlet field S is from H 1,2(X; C) moduli, on the other hand, it has a good reason\nto not have a mass term. This class of moduli originates from the 3-form potential field C (3) ,\nand the gauge symmetry shifting C (3) by an exact 3-form prevents the moduli of this class\nfrom having arbitrary form of superpotential, other than (6) and its non-Abelian extension\n(46). The zero modes of C (3) have the Yukawa couplings (47, 49), because the charged matter\nfields originate from M2-branes, which carry electric charges of C (3) .\nAs we have already noted in footnote 25, the moduli chiral multiplets \u03c6(3,1) from H 3,1 (X; C)\nand the chiral multiplets \u03c6(1,2) from H (1,2) (X; C) tend to have kinetic mixing of the form\n\u0013\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u0012 1 \u01eb\u2217 \u0013 \u0012 \u03c6\n\u2020\n\u2020\n(3,1)\n\u2206K4D,eff. = \u03c6(3,1) , \u03c6(1,2)\n;\n(55)\n\u01eb 1\n\u03c6(1,2)\nwhere the mixing coefficients \u01eb may be loop-suppressed. This kinetic term and the mass term\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0001 MR 0\n1\n\u03c6(3,1)\n\u2206Weff. =\n\u03c6(3,1) , \u03c6(1,2)\n(56)\n0 0\n\u03c6(1,2)\n2\n\nshould be diagonalized simultaneously, in order to identify the mass-eigen-basis with diagonal\nkinetic terms. It is done by\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c6\u0302(3,1)\n\u03c6(3,1)\n1 0\n=\n,\n(57)\n\u2212\u01eb 1\n\u03c6(1,2)\n\u03c6\u0302(1,2)\nwhere \u03c6\u0302(3,1) and \u03c6\u0302(1,2) forms the basis we want. The effective superpotential in the (\u03c6\u0302(3,1) , \u03c6\u0302(1,2) )\nbasis is obtained by substituting (57) to the effective superpotential written in terms of\n(\u03c6(3,1) , \u03c6(1,2) ). Because \u03c6\u0302(1,2) fields only pick up interactions that \u03c6(1,2) have, and because\n(54) of \u03c6(3,1) fields is the only cubic term of the SU(5)GUT singlets, the \u03c6\u0302(1,2) fields are not\ninvolved in any cubic interactions among singlets in the superpotential. This observation\nmay well be taken as a prediction that singlet chiral multiplets appearing in the NMSSM do\nnot have trilinear terms, apart from those possibly generated by M5-brane instantons with\nhighly suppressed coefficients.\n\n23\n\n\fThe H 1,2 (X; C) moduli fields not only have trilinear couplings to vector-like pairs in the\nSU(5)GUT visible sector on S \u2282 B3 , but also to any vector-like pairs \u03a8+ \u03a8\u0304 on other irreducible\npieces of the discriminant. Thus, the singlet field S of the NMSSM may have an effective\nsuperpotential of the form\n\u2206W = \u03bb SHu Hd + \u03be S\u03a8\u03a8\u0304,\n(58)\nwhich is exactly the theory considered in [53].\n\n4\n\nDimension-4 Proton Decay Problem Revisited\n\nUp to know, we have only imposed the conditions that the chiral multiplets of right-handed\nneutrinos are characterized as SU(5)GUT singlets that have Yukawa couplings of the form\n(10). This is, however, not all that is known from phenomenology.\nSo far, we have not introduced an R-parity or anything that replaces it. Thus, in generic\nF-theory compactifications that result in supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model,\nwe should expect the dimension-4 proton decay operators\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2206W = 5\u0304 10 5\u0304 = \u03bb D\u0304 \u016a D\u0304 + \u03bb\u2032 D\u0304 Q L + \u03bb L \u0112 L\n\n(59)\n\nto be generated with unsuppressed couplings. That is a totally unacceptable phenomenologically. The absence of dimension-4 proton decay operators implies that the complex structure\nfor F-theory compactification cannot be just generic, but somewhat special. Moduli fields in\nour vacuum must be fluctuations from such a special choice of complex structure, and chiral\nmultiplets of right-handed neutrinos are among those fluctuations. The special choice of complex structure at our vacuum may have some special implications in physics of right-handed\nneutrinos.\nWhether the right-handed neutrinos have localized wavefunctions or not, and whether\ntheir Majorana masses and Yukawa couplings are localized or not are certainly part of questions of phenomenological interest. As we will see in this section, the answer to these questions\nare indeed different, for various mechanisms that solve the dimension-4 proton decay problem.\n\n4.1\n\nR-parity\n\nImposing R-parity is arguably the most conventional way to get rid of dimension-4 proton\ndecay operators from the low-energy effective theory. If the Calabi\u2013Yau 4-fold X and a 4-form\nflux G(4) on it has a Z2 symmetry, then the symmetry manifests itself in the effective theory.\n\n24\n\n\fBy assumption, the A4 singularity locus S is mapped to itself by the Z2 transformation, and\nmatter curves of various representations to themselves. Note that we consider (X, G(4) ) that\nhas a Z2 symmetry in this scenario; it is not that we take a quotient of (X, G(4) ) by the Z2\nsymmetry.\nBecause of the Z2 invariance of the matter curves c\u0304(R) and the sheaves F(R) on them,\nthe Z2 transformation also acts on the zero modes-vector spaces of holomorphic sections\nH p=0,1(c\u0304(R) ; F(R) ). The zero modes in a given representation R of SU(5)GUT , therefore, split\ninto a direct sum of Z2 -odd part and Z2 -even part. We need to assume that\nh0\u2212 (c\u0304(10) ; F(10) ) = 3, h0\u2212 (c\u0304(5\u0304) ; F(3\u0304\u22825\u0304) ) = 3, h0\u2212 (c\u0304(5\u0304) ; F(2\u0304\u22825\u0304) ) = 3, h1\u2212 (c\u0304(5\u0304) ; F(2\u0304\u22825\u0304) ) = 0,\n\nh0+ (c\u0304(10) ; F(10) ) = 0, h0+ (c\u0304(5\u0304) ; F(3\u0304\u22825\u0304) ) = 0, h0+ (c\u0304(5\u0304) ; F(2\u0304\u22825\u0304) ) = 1, h1+ (c\u0304(5\u0304) ; F(2\u0304\u22825\u0304) ) = 1,\n\nwhere \u00b1 denotes Z2 -even/odd part of the cohomology groups, and that all other cohomology\ngroups vanish, because we need three copies of (Q, \u016a , \u0112)-like chiral multiplets and (D\u0304, L)-like\nchiral multiplets that are odd under the R-parity (matter parity), and we need one pair of\nHiggs doublets that are even under the Z2 symmetry. Note that the Higgs doublets and\nthe (D\u0304, L)-type fields are all localized along the same matter curve, c\u0304(5\u0304) , and yet the curve\nc\u0304(5\u0304) does not have to split into two (or more) irreducible pieces. Codimension-3 singularity\npoints for A4 \u2192 E6 enhancement and those for A4 \u2192 D6 enhancement are also mapped to\nthe codimension-3 singularity points of the same type by the Z2 transformation. Yukawa\ncouplings of the form (59) will be generated at each codimension-3 singularity point of A4 \u2192\nD6 enhancement, but they vanish as a result of Z2 -odd nature of the wavefunctions of the\nthree relevant chiral multiplets after contributions from all the codimension-3 singularity\npoints of this type are summed up. The Yukawa couplings for down-type quarks and charged\nleptons, on the other hand, will remain non-zero, because the Z2 symmetry does not ensure\ncancellation of all the contributions to the Yukawa couplings of this type.\nThe chiral multiplets of right-handed neutrinos correspond to26 H\u22123,1 (X; C), because only\nthe Z2 -odd ones have trilinear couplings suitable for the neutrino Yukawa couplings \u2206W =\nHu N\u0304 L. The Majorana mass terms of the complex structure moduli fields H 3,1(X; C) in (9)\nconsist of H+3,1 (X; C)\u2013H+3,1(X; C) mass terms and H\u22123,1 (X; C)\u2013H\u22123,1(X; C) mass terms, but\nthe mass terms (9) do not have a mixed H+3,1 (X; C)\u2013H\u22123,1(X; C) mass term because of the Z2\nsymmetry of (X, G(4) ). The H\u22123,1 (X; C)\u2013H\u22123,1(X; C) mass terms in (9) are identified with the\nMajorana masses of the right-handed neutrinos.\n26\n\n1,2\nH\u2212\n(X; C) moduli fields also qualify, if the neutrino masses are Dirac.\n\n25\n\n\fIn this scenario, the neutrino Yukawa couplings are localized along the matter curve c\u0304(5\u0304)\nof SU(5)GUT -5\u0304 + 5 representations, but not further localization is expected along the curve.\nThe Majorana mass terms of the right-handed neutrinos come from the Gukov\u2013Vafa\u2013Witten\nsuperpotential, and are not localized anywhere in the Calabi\u2013Yau 4-fold, but come from the\nentire bulk of the geometry.\nThe story developed in sections 2 and 3 holds without any modification in the Z2 symmetry\nscenario. Apart from imposing (assuming) a Z2 symmetry in (X, G(4) ), one does not have to\ndo anything non-trivial. The Z2 -odd part of the moduli fields automatically have neutrino\nYukawa couplings, and the H\u22123,1 (X; C) moduli, in particular, have Majorana masses from\nflux compactification. The Majorana mass scale is just that of the right-handed neutrinos\nto account for the low-energy neutrino masses through the see-saw mechanism. There was\nnothing non-trivial in the scenario above, yet this is still quite remarkable.\nTraditionally in field theory model building in 3+1 dimensions, one tends to consider\nthat it is not an easy task to generate the Majorana masses of right-handed neutrinos, if\nthe gauge group is larger than SU(5)GUT at high-energy (or at microscopic level). In SO(10)\nGUT models, for example, there is an option to introduce an exotic SO(10)-126 field that is\nZ2 -even. Its vev does not break the Z2 symmetry. Majorana mass terms are obtained if an\neffective theory has the following renormalizable coupling,\n\u2206W = h126+ i 16\u2212 16\u2212 .\n\n(60)\n\nThe situation does not change very much when the gauge group at the microscopic level is the\nSU(5)GUT \u00d7 U(1)\u03c7 subgroup of SO(10). The 126 field is replaced by an SU(5)GUT singlet that\ncarries +10 units of the U(1)\u03c7 charge.27 An equally popular alternative is to introduce a less\nexotic field in the SO(10)-16 representation that is Z2 -even. Majorana mass terms of righthanded neutrinos are available, if an effective theory has the following non-renormalizable\ninteractions:\n\u2206W = 16+ 16+ 16\u2212 16\u2212 .\n(61)\nThe origin of those fields and their interactions, as well as the Z2 -parity assignment are\nusually not questioned in field theory model building and such assumptions are just introduced by hand for phenomenological convenience. In string phenomenology, however, these\nissues are \"the questions\" to be addressed. All necessary fields and interactions should be\n27\n\nIt is conventional to set the normalization of U(1)\u03c7 charge so that 10 carries Q\u03c7 = \u22121, (D\u0304, L) has\nQ\u03c7 = +3 units of the U(1)\u03c7 charge, H(5) [resp. H\u0304(5\u0304)] Q\u03c7 = +2 [resp. Q\u03c7 = \u22122] units, and right-handed\nneutrinos N carry Q\u03c7 = \u22125 units.\n\n26\n\n\fderived from known sources. Since charged matter fields of SU(5) GUT models originate\nfrom breaking of a symmetry G larger than SU(5)GUT , for example, in Heterotic E8 \u00d7 E8\nstring compactifications (with supergravity approximation), intersecting D-brane systems,\nand in deformation of singularity in M/F-theory compactifications [11], a larger symmetry\nG exists at this microscopic level in these compactifications, and the origin of the necessary\nfields and interactions have been an issue with no clear answer\nTo see why/how this issue was overcome in generic F-theory compactifications without\nany difficulties, let us remind ourselves of the following. As reviewed in section 2 of [9],\nphysics of SU(5)GUT GUT models in generic F-theory compactifications is described by a\npatchwork of gauge theories. The locus of A4 singularity S is covered by various patches,\nand individual patches have their own gauge groups containing SU(5)GUT . In patches that\ncontain the matter curve c\u0304(10) , the gauge group should be G = SO(10) \u2283 SU(5)GUT or larger.\nIf a patch in S contains the matter curve c\u0304(5\u0304) , then the gauge group in this patch has to be\nG = SU(6) or larger. The gauge group in a patch containing a codimension-3 singularity\npoint should be larger than SU(5)GUT at least by rank 2, that is, G is at least E6 , SO(12) or\nSU(7), because 2 independent topological 2-cycles collapse at the codimension-3 singularity\npoint. The gauge groups in these field theory local models can be chosen even larger for\nhigher level of approximation. The field thoery local models defined on various patches on\nS may have different gauge groups G with different ranks, but they can be glued together\nwithin an overlap of two neighboring patches, because a gauge theory with lower rank gauge\ngroup can provide reasonably well approximation when one of 2-cycles becomes large.\nAn important point is that there is no common \"microscopic gauge group\" G containing\n\u2032\nG \u00d7 SU(5)GUT over the entire A4 singularity locus S in generic F-theory compactifications.28\nThe absence of the common structure group G\u2032 means that the right-handed neutrinos and\nanything that effectively becomes the Majorana mass parameters cannot be characterized as\nsomething in definite representation of the \"common structure group G\u2032 \" (or of the \"microscopic gauge group G\"), and all the theoretical constraints associated with the representation\ntheory of G\u2032 or G have gone. In generic F-theory compactifications, no clear line is drawn\nbetween the fields in the gauge theory sector and bulk gravity sector, as opposed to the\n(dual of) Heterotic string compactifications with supergravity approximation, or to the Type\nIIB Calabi\u2013Yau orientifold compactifications. Complex structure moduli H 3,1 (X; C) of bulk\ngravity can also be regarded locally as a part of Cartan subspace in local models on S with\n28\n\nF-theory compactifications with Heterotic dual are an exception, because a unique gauge group G = E8\nand the structure group G\u2032 = SU(5)str are found.\n\n27\n\n\fG = SU(6) gauge groups. This class of SU(5)GUT -neutral fields can be identified with righthanded neutrinos, because they have a natural SU(6) gauge interactions (10) that can be\nidentified with the neutrino Yukawa couplings, and yet, the gauge invariance of G = SU(6)\nconstrains the interactions of these right-handed neutrinos only in a local geometry, and\ndoes not prevent them from having the Majorana mass terms in the Gukov\u2013Vafa\u2013Witten\nsuperpotential. This is the heart of the trick that solve the long-standing problem in generic\nF-theory compactifications.\n\n4.2\n\nReducible Limit of Spectral Surface\n\nSome other solutions to the dimension-4 proton decay problem in F-theory have already been\ndiscussed in the literature; the Z2 symmetry scenario in section 4.1 is not the first one. In\nsections 4.2\u20134.4, we will elaborate on these alternative scenarios, and discuss phenomenological consequences in these scenarios. In section 4.2, we will work on a scenario [1], where\nspectral surfaces are reducible, and an extra U(1) symmetry is used to bring the dimension-4\nproton decay operators under control, instead of the Z2 symmetry.\nDefining equation of local geometry of Calabi\u2013Yau 4-fold X is given by\ny 2 = x3 + (a5 xy + a4 zx2 + a3 z 2 y + a2 z 3 x + a0 z 5 )\n+(A5 zy + A4 z 2 x2 + A3 z 3 y + A2 z 4 x + A0 z 6 ) + * * *\n\n(62)\n\nfor generic F-theory compactifications that leave SU(5) GUTs [24]. (x, y) are the coordinates\nof the elliptic fiber of X. The discriminant of this elliptic fibration is given by\n\u0014\n\u001b\n\u0015\n\u0013\n\u001a \u0012\n1 4 (5)\nz 2\na5 A5\n5\n2\n(5)\n2 (5)\n\u2206=z\n+ O(z ) ,\n(63)\nP \u2212 a5 R\u0303\na P + a5 12 a4 +\n16 5\n16\n2\nwhere\nP (5) = a0 a25 \u2212 a2 a5 a3 + a4 a23 ,\n\n(64)\n\nand the definition of R\u0303(5) is given later in this article. An irreducible component S of the\ndiscriminant locus is found along z = 0; and hence z is the normal coordinate of S in B3 .\nWe will take a set of local coordinates (u, v) on a local patch of S. ar (u, v) and Ar (u, v) (r =\n0, 2, * * * , 5) are locally regarded as functions on S, and ellipses stand for terms higher order\nin the series expansion of z. ar 's, Ar 's and all others are regarded globally as holomorphic\nsections of appropriate line bundles; defining a divisor t (or equivalently \u03b7) on S through\nc1 (NS|B3 ) \u2261 t \u2261 (6KS + \u03b7) [60], relevant line bundles are\nar \u2208 \u0393(S; O(rKS + \u03b7)) = \u0393(S; O(\u2212(6 \u2212 r)KS + t)),\n28\n\nAr \u2208 \u0393(S; O(\u2212(6 \u2212 r)KS )). (65)\n\n\fIn the first line of (62), (a5 xy + * * * + a0 z 6 ) part closely resembles the defining equation\nof a spectral surface of an SU(5) vector bundle in Heterotic E8 \u00d7 E8 string compactification\non an elliptic fibered Calabi\u2013Yau 3-fold Z,\n5\u03c3 + div(a5 xy + a4 x2 + a3 y + a2 x + a0 ).\n\n(66)\n\nHere, \u03c3 is the zero section of the elliptic fibration\n\u03c0Z : Z \u2192 S,\n\n(67)\n\nand ar (r = 0, 2, * * * , 5) are regarded as holomorphic sections of line bundles on S given as\nin (65) for some divisor \u03b7 of S. This resemblance is at the heart of the duality between\nHeterotic string and F-theory compactifications [54, 55, 6, 8, 9]. Although not all of F-theory\ncompactifications have a Heterotic dual, physics along the A4 singularity locus S at z = 0\nfor generic F-theory compactifications is still qualitatively similar to that of Heterotic string\ncompactification.\n4.2.1\n\nSO(10) Scenario\n\nIn Heterotic E8 \u00d7 E8 string compactification, the structure group of a rank-5 vector bundle\nV5 may be reduced from SU(5) to its subgroup SU(4) \u00d7 U(1)\u03c7 , and V5 = U4 \u2295 L\u03c7 , where U4\nand L\u03c7 are rank-4 and rank-1 bundles, respectively. This can be achieved, for example, by\nsetting a5 = 0 in (66). The spectral surface CV5 = C(10) becomes reducible then:\n\u0002\n\u0003\n4\u03c3 + div(a4 x2 + * * * a0 ) + \u03c3.\n\n(68)\n\nU(1)\u03c7 symmetry transformation commutes with the structure group SU(4)\u00d7U(1)\u03c7 , and hence\nremains as a global symmetry of the effective action. One can do the same thing in generic\nF-theory compactifications by setting a5 = 0 in (62) [1]. In this limit, the spectral surface of\nthe Higgs bundle for fields in the SU(5)GUT -10 representation, C(10) , becomes reducible:\nC(10) \u2192 C(16) + \u03c3,\n\n\u0002\n\n\u0003\na5 + a4 \u03be + a3 \u03be 2 + * * * = 0 \u2192 [a4 + a3 \u03be + * * * = 0] + [\u03be = 0],\n\n(69)\n\nwhere \u03c3 is the zero section of the canonical bundle \u03c0KS : KS \u2192 S, and \u03be is the coordinate of\nthe rank-1 fiber vector space of the canonical bundle KS .\nNow, with a5 = 0, the discriminant \u2206 begins with an O(z 7 ) term, and we have a split\nD5 singularity along S. There is an SO(10) gauge theory defined globally on S. The SO(10)\nsymmetry can be broken down to SU(5)GUT \u00d7 U(1)\u03c7 or GSM \u00d7 U(1)\u03c7 [GSM \u2261 SU(3)C \u00d7\n29\n\n\fSU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y ] subgroup by turning on fluxes. The massless vector fields may or may\nnot become massive through the St\u00fcckelberg interactions, but the associated global U(1)\u03c7\nsymmetry remains unbroken (unless spontaneous symmetry breaking is triggered; we will\ncome back to this issue in section 4.4). The dimension-4 proton decay operators are not\nallowed in the presence of unbroken U(1)\u03c7 symmetry, because the operators (59) have Q\u03c7 =\n+5 6= 0 units of the U(1)\u03c7 charge (see footnote 27). Note that we do not need a Heterotic dual\nfor this scenario to make sense; in other words, we do not need a rank-5 Higgs bundle defined\nglobally on S. The essence here is to have a U(1)\u03c7 \u2282 SO(10) gauge symmetry on S, which\nis characterized also as a reducible limit of the spectral surface C(10) . This characterisation,\na5 = 0, involves information only of local geometry along S, and fully generic F-theory\ncompactifications can be considered (regardless of whether Heterotic dual exists or not), as\nlong as this condition is satisfied.\nLet us now give some thoughts on the candidates of the right-handed neutrinos in this\nscenario. We now consider a limit where the spectral surface C(10) consists (at least) of two\nirreducible components. Along the intersection of the two components, the spectral surface\nC(10) is singular. Thus, we have to reconsider the argument in section 3, where the spectral\nsurface was implicitly assumed to be smooth.\nSuppose that the Higgs bundle (\u03c6, V ) [i.e. Higgs sheaf V] is decomposed into a direct sum\n(\u03c61 \u2295 \u03c62 , V1 \u2295 V2 ) [i.e., V = iC1 \u2217 N1 \u2295 iC2 \u2217 N2 ]. Instead of H 0 (C(10) ; KC(10) ) and H 1 (C(10) ; C)\nin (40), we find that Ext1 (V, V) in (42) is the suitable characterization of the moduli fields,\nwhen the spectral surface consists of two irreducible pieces C1 + C2 . The extension group\ncan be decomposed as follows in such a reducible limit:\nExt1 (V, V) = Ext1 (i1\u2217 N1 , i1\u2217 N1 ) + Ext1 (i2\u2217 N2 , i2\u2217 N2 )\n\n+Ext1 (i1\u2217 N1 , i2\u2217 N2 ) + Ext1 (i2\u2217 N2 , i1\u2217 N1 ).\n\n(70)\n\nThe last two components are essentially localized along the intersection of the two surfaces,\nC1 and C2 . Irreducible pieces of the Higgs sheaf iCi \u2217 Ni (i = 1, 2) on KS can be treated as if\nthey were 7-branes in Calabi\u2013Yau orientifolds; the spectral surfaces Ci play the role of the\nsupports of the \"7-branes\" and Ni the \"gauge bundles\" on them. The localized pieces of the\nmoduli are like \"open strings\" connecting the \"7-branes\".\nFor the case of practical interest, we consider a limit where the Higgs sheaf for the\nSU(5)GUT -10 representation fields V(10) becomes reducible:\nV(10) \u2192 iC(16) \u2217 N(16) + i\u03c3\u2217 L\u03c7 .\n30\n\n(71)\n\n\fL\u03c7 is the line bundle on S whose structure group is U(1)\u03c7 .

The SU(5)GUT -neutral component in the SO(10)16 representation has Q\u03c7 = \u22125 units of the U(1)\u03c7 charge. If there are such chiral multiplets\nc\n(72) [denoted by N] and their vector-like partners (73) [denoted by N ], then their products\nc\nNN are sections of a line bundle\nO(2KS + r(16) )|c\u0304(16) = O(KS + C(16) )|c\u0304(16) = O(5KS + \u03b7)|c\u0304(16) ;\n\n(74)\n\nin the last step of the equation above, we used the fact that all the terms a4 , a3 \u03be etc. appearing\nin the defining equation of C(16) are sections of O(4KS + \u03b7). Using the exact sequence\n0 \u2192 OS (KS ) \u2192 OS (KS + C(16) ) \u2192 ic\u0304(16) \u2217 O(KS + C(16) ) \u2192 0\n\n(75)\n\nand its long exact sequence\n0 \u2192 H 0 (S; KS ) \u2192 H 0 (S; O(5KS + \u03b7)) \u2192 H 0 (c\u0304(16) ; O(KS + C(16) )) \u2192 H 1 (S; KS )\n\n(76)\n\nc\n\none finds that the space of N N , the third term in (76), is identified with the second term,\nc\nif h2,0 (S) = h0,1 (S) = 0. Thus, non-vanishing expectation values of (NN ) correspond to\nnon-vanishing a5 \u2208 \u0393(S; O(5KS + \u03b7)), and to recombination of the two irreducible pieces \u03c3\nand C(16) of the spectral surface.29\nAt the reducible limit of the spectral surface, the (D\u0304, L)-type matter is on the matter\ncurve c\u0304(16) of SO(10) models (a4 = 0), and the Hu \u2282 H(5) chiral multiplet is on the matter\ncurve c\u0304vect. (a3 = 0). Thus, the neutrino Yukawa couplings are likely to be localized at the\nintersection points of the two matter curves, (a3 , a4 ) = (0, 0). A trilinear interaction\n\u2206W = 16 16 vect.\n29\n\nThe observation so far improves a similar argument made earlier in [1].\n\n31\n\n(77)\n\n\fis generated at this type of codimension-3 singularity points [7, 9]. The moduli chiral multiplets N in (72) are also regarded as the ordinary \"right-handed neutrinos\" in the spinor\nrepresentation of SO(10), and these N fields do have the neutrino Yukawa couplings with L\nand Hu as a part of the interactions above. Thus, the fields (72) are regarded indeed as the\nright-handed neutrinos.\nSU(5)GUT -neutral fields coming from Ext1 (iC(16) \u2217 N(16) , iC(16) \u2217 N(16) ) (or equivalently, the\nbulk H 3,1 and H 1,2 moduli), on the other hand, are neutral under the U(1)\u03c7 symmetry.\nSince Hu \u2282 H(5) and L \u2282 (D\u0304, L) have Q\u03c7 = +2 and Q\u03c7 = +3 units of the U(1)\u03c7 charges,\nU(1)\u03c7 -neutral fields cannot have Yukawa couplings with these two fields. Therefore, only\n(72) moduli can be identified with right-handed neutrinos in this scenario.\n4.2.2\n\nSU(6) Scenario\n\nAn alternative to the a5 = 0 scenario (or SO(10) scenario) is to consider another factorization\nlimit of the spectral surface\n5\u03c3 + div(a5 xy + a4 zx2 + a3 y + a2 x + a0 )\n\u2192 [2\u03c3 + div(p2 x + p0 )] + [3\u03c3 + div(q3 y + q2 x + q0 )]\n\n(78)\n\nin Heterotic language. This is to consider a limit where the structure group of rank-5 vector\nbundle V5 becomes SU(3) \u00d7 SU(2) \u00d7 U(1)q\u03037 , and V5 = U3 \u2295 U2 , where U3 and U2 are rank-3\nand rank-2 bundles, respectively. In F-theory language, this is to require that for a pair of\ndivisors \u03b7 \u2032 and \u03b7 \u2032\u2032 on S that satisfy \u03b7 \u2032 + \u03b7 \u2032\u2032 = \u03b7, there exist\npr \u2208 \u0393(S; O(rKS + \u03b7 \u2032 )) (r = 0, 2),\n\nqr \u2208 \u0393(S; O(rKS + \u03b7 \u2032\u2032 )) (r = 0, 2, 3),\n\n(79)\n\nand ar (r = 0, 2, 3, 4, 5) are given by\na0 = p0 q0 ,\n\na2 = p0 q2 + p2 q0 ,\n\na3 = p0 q3 ,\n\na5 = p2 q3 .\n\na4 = p2 q2 ,\n\n(80)\n(81)\n\nNo conditions are imposed on other sections such as Ar 's in (62) [1, 36]. Under this choice of\ncomplex structure of X, the defining equation of the c\u0304(5\u0304) matter curve of SU(5)GUT models\nvanish identically on S:\nP (5) = p0 p2 q32 (p2 q0 \u2212 (p2 q0 + p0 q2 ) + p0 q2 ) = 0,\n\n32\n\n(82)\n\n\fand the discriminant \u2206 begins at the order of z 6 . Split A5 singularity is along the surface S,\nand an SU(6) gauge theory is globally defined on S. The SU(6) symmetry may be broken\ndown to SU(5)GUT \u00d7 U(1)q\u03037 or GSM \u00d7 U(1)q\u03037 by turning on fluxes. Since the U(1)q\u03037 symmetry\nis defined globally on S, and commutes with the structure group of the Higgs bundle in Ftheory compactifications, it remains as a global symmetry of low-energy effective theory\nunless it is spontaneously broken by a vev of a field with non-vanishing U(1)q\u03037 charge. The\ndimension-4 proton decay operators are absent when this global symmetry remains unbroken,\njust like in the SO(10) (a5 = 0) scenario. The essence here is the U(1)q\u03037 gauge symmetry\non S, nothing else in the bulk of Calabi\u2013Yau 4-fold X. Thus, the SU(6) scenario can be\nconsidered in fully generic F-theory compactifications, regardless of whether Heterotic dual\nexists or not.\nModuli (SU(5)GUT -neutral) fields are decomposed as in (70) in this scenario as well. Here,\nthe spectral surface C(5\u0304) for the fields in SU(5)GUT -5\u0304 representation reduces to\nC(5\u0304) \u2192 C(6\u0304) + C(\u22272 6) + \u03c3,\n\n(83)\n\nand localized moduli are found on the curve c\u0304(6\u0304) given by the intersection30 of C(6\u0304) and \u03c3.\nLet us denote the SU(5)GUT -singlet chiral multiplets in the SU(6)-6 representation as N , and\nc\nthose in the SU(6)-6\u0304 representation as N . In this scenario, the up-type Higgs Hu comes from\nthe H(5) \u2282 adj. of SU(6) in the bulk of S, and lepton doublet L \u2282 (D\u0304, L) chiral multiplets\nare localized along the matter curve c\u0304(6\u0304) [1]. The curve-curve-bulk Yukawa couplings\n\u2206W = 6\u0304 adj. 6 \u2283 L Hu N\n\n(85)\n\nis generated all along the curve c\u0304(6\u0304) [7], and this Yukawa couplings and the chiral multiplets\nN can be identified with the neutrino Yukawa couplings and the right-handed neutrinos in\n30\n\nAlthough the intersection of \u03c3 and C(6\u0304) can be regarded as that of two irreducible pieces in (83), this\nintersection can also be regarded as the matter curve of SU(6)-6\u0304 representation in SU(6) unified theories.\nThe discriminant is given by\nz6 3 4\np q S(6KS +3\u03b7\u2032 +2\u03b7\u2032\u2032 ) + O(z 7 )\n(84)\n\u2206=\n16 2 3\nunder the choice of complex structure in (80\u201381). Here, S(6KS +3\u03b7\u2032 +2\u03b7\u2032\u2032 ) is a section of O(6KS + 3\u03b7 \u2032 + 2\u03b7 \u2032\u2032 ),\nand is given by p0,2 , q0,2,3 and A0,2,3,4,5 ; its explicit form is so messy that we do not write it here, but the zero\nlocus of S(6KS +3\u03b7\u2032 +2\u03b7\u2032\u2032 ) is the matter curve c\u0304(6\u0304) . The matter curve c\u0304(\u22273 6) is given by (p2 = 0) \u2208 |2KS + \u03b7 \u2032 |,\nwhile (q3 = 0) \u2208 |3KS + \u03b7 \u2032\u2032 | is the matter curve c\u0304(\u22272 6) . All the terms in S(6KS +3\u03b7\u2032 +2\u03b7\u2032\u2032 ) contain either p2 or\nq3 , and hence the curve c\u0304(6\u0304) (where (D\u0304, L)-type zero modes are localized) pass through all the intersection\npoints of the matter curves c\u0304(\u22273 6) (where SU(5)GUT -10 fields are localized) and c\u0304(\u22272 6) (where SU(5)GUT H\u0304(5\u0304) is supported). This means that the down-type / charged lepton Yukawa couplings are not necessarily\nsuppressed; see [1] for more details.\n\n33\n\n\fthis scenario. Just like in the SO(10) (a5 = 0) scenario, singlets from H 3,1 or H 1,2 that are\nnot associated with the singularity of the spectral surface do not have appropriate U(1)q\u03037\ncharges, and hence cannot have trilinear couplings for neutrino Yukawas. Thus, they are not\nidentified with the right-handed neutrinos.\n4.2.3\n\nMajorana masses\n\nBoth the SO(10) and SU(6) scenarios above leave an unbroken global U(1) symmetry. Such\na U(1) symmetry is a powerful and reliable way to make sure that the dimension-4 proton\ndecay operators are absent, but it is actually too powerful. Right-handed neutrinos in the\ntwo scenarios above are charged under the global U(1)\u03c7 or U(1)q\u03037 symmetry, and hence\nthey cannot have Majorana mass terms. Without relying upon the see-saw mechanism of\nright-handed neutrinos, one has to resort to the see-saw mechanism of higgsino/wino in\nthe (bilinear) R-parity violating scenario [56, 57], or to assume that the neutrino Yukawa\ncouplings are somehow sufficiently small; \u03bb(\u03bd) < 10\u221212 . Although the H 3,1 moduli irrelevant\nto the intersection of the spectral surfaces still have Majorana mass terms from (9), they\ncannot have neutrino Yukawa couplings because the U(1) charge do not match.\nOne may not exclude a possibility that the Majorana masses are generated for fields\nlike (72) through M5-brane instanton effects. M5-brane instantons are much like D3-brane\ninstantons in Type IIB string theory, and a recent review article is available [58]. Usually\nsuch an amplitude involves a small exponential factor, coming from the volume of a divisor\nof B3 that \"D3-branes\" are wrapped. Since the right-handed neutrinos are localized along a\ncurve in S in either one of these SO(10) or SU(6) scenarios, the Kaluza\u2013Klein scale of S and\nB3 , that is, RGUT and R6 , set the scale of the volume of the divisor, unless there are some\ncollapsed divisors in B3 . As we will see in section 4.4.1, such an exponential factor is too\nsmall, when the volume is estimated by using RGUT and R6 . Thus, moduli of geometry have\nto be tuned so that B3 has a divisor with small volume, in order to generate large enough\nMajorana masses of the right-handed neutrinos.\n\n4.3\n4.3.1\n\nReducible Limit of SU(5)GUT-5\u0304 Matter Curve\nJust the reducible limit of the matter curve\n\nIt was suggested in [10, 36] that the dimension-4 proton decay problem may be solved by\nconsidering a reducible limit of the matter curve c\u0304(5\u0304) :\nc\u0304(5\u0304) = c\u0304(D\u0304L) + c\u0304(H) .\n34\n\n(86)\n\n\fThe idea is that the curve c\u0304(D\u0304L) supports only the three chiral multiplets of matter (D\u0304, L),\nand the up-type and down-type Higgs doublets are supported in the other curve31 c\u0304(H) . At\nall the codimension-3 singularity points for the enhancement A4 \u2192 D6 , the matter curve\nc\u0304(5\u0304) forms a double point, and the idea is to assume that the two branches of the matter\ncurve passing through the double point correspond to c\u0304(D\u0304L) and c\u0304(H) . Mathematically, this\nassumption is equivalent to factorization of the defining equation of the curve c\u0304(5\u0304) as follows:\nP (5) = a0 a25 \u2212 a2 a5 a3 + a4 a23 = (p0 a5 \u2212 p2 a3 )(q0 a5 \u2212 q2 a3 ).\n\n(87)\n\nHere, pr \u2208 \u0393(S; O(rKS + \u03b7 \u2032 )) (r = 0, 2), qr \u2208 \u0393(S; O(rKS + \u03b7 \u2032\u2032 )) (r = 0, 2) and the divisors\n\u03b7 \u2032 and \u03b7 \u2032\u2032 on S satisfy \u03b7 \u2032 + \u03b7 \u2032\u2032 = \u03b7. As noted in [36], this condition is actually equivalent to\nthe condition (80) alone without (81), and hence can be regarded as a generalization of the\nSU(6) scenario in section 4.2.\nThe assumptions in section 4.2 surely get rid of dimension-4 proton decay operators,\nbut the unbroken U(1) symmetry were too powerful because they forbid the Majorana mass\nterms of right-handed neutrinos altogether at perturbative level. The condition (80) alone is\ncertainly more general, and the Majorana masses of right-handed neutrinos may be generated.\nA reducible limit of the matter curve is a weaker condition than the reducible limit of the\nspectral surface. But now we do not necessarily have such a U(1) symmetry in the effective\ntheory, and it is not absolutely clear whether the dimension-4 proton decay operators are\nabsent in the effective theory. We therefore study in this section 4.3 whether the reducible\nlimit of the matter curve (86) is a sufficient condition for the absence of the dimension-4\nproton decay operators.\nIt is important to note that reducible limit of the matter curve (86) does not immediately\nimply that the sheaf cohomology on the curve also splits as in\nH 0 (c\u0304(5\u0304) ; F(5\u0304) ) \u2192 H 0 (c\u0304(D\u0304L) ; F(D\u0304L) ) \u2295 H 0 (c\u0304(H) ; F(H) ).\n\n(88)\n\nFor this splitting to take place, one needs to make sure in the reducible limit of the curve\nthat the sheaf F(5\u0304) also becomes\nF(5\u0304) \u2192 i(D\u0304L)\u2217 F(D\u0304L) \u2295 i(H)\u2217 F(H) ,\n31\n\n(89)\n\nAn option of taking a further reducible limit of c\u0304(H) \u2192 c\u0304(Hu) + c\u0304(Hd) has been discussed as a solution to\nthe dimension-5 proton decay problem in [10]. Our discussion in this section 4.3 is applied, in such a limit,\nmostly to c\u0304(D\u0304L) and c\u0304(Hd) . See also discussion at the end of section 4.3. Note also that the dimension-5 proton\ndecay problem is not as serious in such string compactifications as in GUT models on 3+1 dimensions; this is\nbecause not much is known about the Yukawa couplings involving Kaluza\u2013Klein colored Higgsinos [59, 10].\n\n35\n\n\fwhere\ni(D\u0304L) : c\u0304(D\u0304L) \u0592\u2192 c\u0304(5\u0304) ,\n\ni(H) : c\u0304(H) \u0592\u2192 c\u0304(5\u0304) .\n\n(90)\n\nSections of a line bundle F(D\u0304L) [resp. F(H) ] form a rank-1 fiber at a given point of the\nmatter curve c\u0304(D\u0304L) [resp. c\u0304(H) ], but rank of the the sheaf F(5\u0304) suddenly jumps up to 2 at\nthe intersection point of the two curves in the case of (89). The question is whether this\ncondition is realized automatically at the reducible limit of the matter curve (86).\nLet us call (p0 a5 \u2212 p2 a3 ) = 0 piece as c\u0304(D\u0304L) , and (q0 a5 \u2212 q2 a3 ) = 0 as c\u0304(H) . The two\ncurves surely intersect at points in S where (a5 , a3 ) = (0, 0). That is where A4 singularity is\nenhanced to D6 . We know that the condition (89) is satisfied there, at least at the level of\nanalyses in [8, 9]. The other type of intersection points are found where\np0 : p2 = q0 : q2 = a3 : a5 ,\n\n(91)\n\nbut (a5 , a3 ) 6= (0, 0). Since (91) consists of two conditions, (91) is satisfied at finite number of\nisolated points on S generically. Is the condition (89) satisfied at this type of codimension-3\nsingularities?\nLet us study this problem by constructing a field theory model of local geometry around\na point of this type.

The undeformed singularity\nis A4 at a generic point on S, but it is enhanced to A5 on either one of the matter curves\nc\u0304(D\u0304L) and c\u0304(H) , because P (5) = (p0 a5 \u2212 p2 a3 )(q0 a5 \u2212 q2 a3 ) vanishes. At the intersection points\nof the two curves, the first two terms of R\u0303(5) vanish, because\n(a2 a5 \u2212 2a3 a4 ) = p2 (q0 a5 \u2212 q2 a3 ) + q2 (p0 a5 \u2212 p2 a3 ).\n\n(97)\n\nThe last two terms in R\u0303(5) , however, do not have a reason to vanish at such intersection\npoints, and hence R\u0303(5) 6= 0 generically. The singularity in the (x\u0303, \u1ef9, z) space remains A5\nat this type of intersection points, without being enhanced to A6 . The absence of further\nenhancement can also be seen easily from the discriminant (63). The coefficient of the z 6 term\nbecomes \u2212a45 R\u0303(5) /16 \u2192 a45 (a23 A4 + a25 y\u22172 )/16, which is the same as the last two terms of R\u0303(5) .\nIt does not vanish generically, and hence the discriminant is not enhanced to z 7 at this type\nof codimension-3 singularity point. It is not that we failed to find an appropriate set of local\ncoordinates and/or scaling limit to detect enhanced singularity, because the discriminant\nremains \u2206 \u223c z 6 ; the singularity remains A5 .\nLocal geometry around this type of intersection points, therefore, can be modelled by an\nSU(6) gauge theory. Let us take a set of local coordinates (u, v) on S, so that\nu\u2261\n\np0 a3\n\u2212 ,\np2 a5\n\nv\u2261\n\nq0 a3\n\u2212 .\nq2 a5\n\n(98)\n\nThe background field value of \u03c6 is chosen as32\n5\n\n32\n\nz }| {\nh\u03c6i \u221d diag(0, * * * , 0, uv du \u2227 dv).\n\n(99)\n\nIn the language of elliptic fibered compactification of Heterotic string, the behavior of \u03c6 is understood\nas follows. The stable degeneration limit of F-theory compactifications corresponds to a limit of Heterotic\ncompactifications where supergravity approximation is good, and we restrict our attention to this region of\nthe moduli space. In this limit, A4 is small, and f0 = A2 and g0 = A0 determine the complex structure of\nelliptic fiber y 2 = x3 + f0 x + g0 of Heterotic compactification. The spectral surface (66) determines five points\nin a given elliptic fiber. For small (u, v), the (x, y) coordinates of the two among the five points behave as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3x2\u2217 + f0\np2 q2 uv\n1,\n\u00b1\n,\n(x, y)\u00b1 \u223c (x\u2217 , \u00b1y\u2217 ) + \u2213\na5 y\u22172\n2y\u2217\nand three other points are determined by (a5 /p2 q2 )y + x \u2212 x\u2217 = 0 on the elliptic curve. Thus, the group-law\nsum of the two points p\u00b1 = (x, y)\u00b1 become \u03bep+ \u229ep\u2212 \u2243 (p2 q2 /a5 )uv/y\u22172 ; \u03be \u2243 x/y is the local coordinate of the\nelliptic fiber near the infinity point. The addition theorem of elliptic functions is used here. Values of \u03be of\nnine other points of the form pj \u229e pk are not close to zero. Thus, the spectral surface C\u22272 V5 has only one\nsmooth layer \u03be \u2243 (p2 q2 /a5 )uv/y\u22172 near the zero locus \u03be = 0, and nine other layers are far away from \u03be = 0.\n\n37\n\n\fThe zero modes in the SU(5)GUT -5\u0304 representation originate from the 1 \u00d7 5 lower-left block\nin the 6 \u00d7 6 matrix representation of SU(6). An important point is that the zero mode\nwavefunction (\u03c8, \u03c7) is in a single component representation of the background; \u03c1(h\u03c6i) \u221d\nuv du \u2227 dv acts on the zero mode wavefunction as a 1 \u00d7 1 matrix. Zero mode wavefunctions\n2\n(\u03c8, \u03c7) will approximately be Gaussian e\u2212|u| near the matter curve c\u0304(D\u0304L) (u = 0), and will\n2\nbe Gaussian e\u2212|v| near the matter curve c\u0304(H) (v = 0), but the wavefunctions on the both\nbranches cannot take different values at the intersection point. Both (\u03c8, \u03c7)|c\u0304(D\u0304L) along (0, \u2200 v)\non c\u0304(D\u0304L) and (\u03c8, \u03c7)|c\u0304(H) along (\u2200 u, 0) on c\u0304(H) should approach the same value (\u03c8, \u03c7)|(u,v)=(0,0)\nat the intersection point. A line bundle N(5\u0304) is on the smooth spectral surface given by\n\u03be \u221d uv, and the sheaf F(5\u0304) on the curve c\u0304(5\u0304) = c\u0304(D\u0304L) + c\u0304(H) is a restriction of a line bundle\nN(5\u0304) \u2297 KS on c\u0304(5\u0304) given by \u03be = 0 on the spectral surface. The sheaf F(5\u0304) remains strictly\nrank-1 at any points of the curve c\u0304(5\u0304) , and the rank does not jump up to 2 at the intersection\npoint. The zero modes in this case are not regarded as locally free fluctuations on c\u0304(D\u0304L) and\nlocally free fluctuations on c\u0304(H) that are mutually independent locally, but the wavefunctions\non the two curves are constrained to have the same value at the intersection points.\nThus, the reducible limit of the matter curve alone does not guarantee that the zero\nmodes of the (D\u0304, L) type and Higgs type split into the two distinct curves. Therefore, we\nconclude that taking the reducible limit of the matter curve alone does not help remove the\ndimension-4 proton decay operators.\n4.3.2\n\ntuning more parameters\n\nWith a little more tuning of coefficients of the defining equation (62), the coefficient of the\nz 6 term (\u221d a23 A4 + a25 y\u22172 ) can be made vanish at each of such intersection points. The number\nof such points is given topologically by\n(5KS + \u03b7 + \u03b7 \u2032 ) * (5KS + \u03b7 + \u03b7 \u2032\u2032 ) \u2212 (5KS + \u03b7) * (3KS + \u03b7).\n\n(100)\n\nThere may be many of them, and the same number of complex structure moduli may have to\nbe tuned by hand, yet one might accept this tuning in order to avoid the dimension-4 proton\ndecay.\nNow the field theory local model is an SU(7) gauge theory. By rescaling the local coordinates (u, v) if necessary, the defining equation of the spectral surface C(5\u0304) can be made\nA\u03be 2 + (u + v)\u03be + uv = 0,\n\n38\n\n(101)\n\n\fand the \u03be = 0 locus on C(5\u0304) , that is uv = 0, is the matter curve c\u0304(5\u0304) . A is a coefficient that\nwe do not specify; rescaling of local coordinates (u, v) and \u03be cannot absorb this A. Local\ngeometry of X is given by \u1ef9 2 \u2212 x\u03032 \u2243 z 5 (Az 2 +(u+v)z+uv), and two topologically independent\n2-cycles in the (x\u0303, \u1ef9, z) space vanish on u = 0 (c\u0304(D\u0304L) ) and v = 0 (c\u0304(H) ) respectively. Thus,\nthere are two extra topologically independent vanishing 2-cycles at the intersection point\n(u, v) = (0, 0), and it may be possible that the independent degrees of zero modes are\nlocally associated with these independent 2-cycles. If this is proved to be true,33 then the\nsplitting of the matter fields in SU(5)GUT -5\u0304 representation as desired in (88, 89) may follow,\nas classification of zero-mode degrees of freedom.\nIt should be noted, however, that the spectral surface C(5\u0304) given by (101) is still a single\nirreducible surface unless A = 1. The matter curve is reducible, but the spectral surface is\nnot. As we have learnt in [9], zero-mode wavefunctions of charged matter fields are regarded\nas single component (\u03c8, \u03c7) wavefunctions on the spectral surface. Even for a zero-mode\nwhose wavefunction can be characterized by a holomorphic section on the curve u = 0 [resp.\nv = 0] in C(5\u0304) , we cannot imagine that the wavefunction (\u03c8, \u03c7) is absolutely zero in any open\nsubset of C(5\u0304) ; if it were, then it would be zero everywhere on C(5\u0304) . Thus, zero modes that\nmay be classified as \"H 0 (c\u0304(D\u0304L) ; F(D\u0304L) )\" should also have non-vanishing wavefunctions along\nthe c\u0304(H) curve (and vice versa).\nIf we are to phrase this statement in language of field theory local models, that will be\nas follows. One can choose SU(7) as the gauge group of field theory local models around\npoints satisfying (91). Along the matter curve c\u0304(H) [resp. matter curve c\u0304(D\u0304L) ] away from\nthe (u, v) = (0, 0) points, however, field theory models with an SU(6)H \u2282 SU(7) [resp.\nSU(6)M \u2282 SU(7)] gauge group can provide a reasonable approximation. An argument in the\nprevious paragraph means that zero modes that may be classified as \"H 0 (c\u0304(D\u0304L) ; F(D\u0304L) )\" also\nhave non-vanishing single component (\u03c8, \u03c7) wavefunction in the SU(6)H gauge theory along\nthe curve c\u0304(H) .\nNow, it is at the codimension-3 singularity points (a3 , a5 ) = (0, 0) that the trilinear\ncouplings for the dimension-4 proton decay (59) are potentially generated. SO(12) gauge\ntheories can be chosen as field theory local models of geometry around this type of singularity.\nTwo branches of the matter curve c\u0304(5\u0304) pass through this type of points, and under the\nassumption (87), the two branches correspond to c\u0304(D\u0304L) and c\u0304(H) respectively. Field theory\nlocal models with SU(6)H \u2282 SO(12) [resp. SU(6)M \u2282 SO(12)] gauge group can provide a\n33\n\nAs the spectral surface (101) is singular at (\u03be, u, v) = (0, 0, 0), structure of the sheaves N(5\u0304) and F(5\u0304) is\nnot obvious there.\n\n39\n\n\fgood approximation along the matter curve c\u0304(H) [resp. c\u0304(D\u0304L) ] away from the (a3 , a5 ) = (0, 0)\npoints. Any zero modes in the SU(5)GUT -5\u0304 representation are assigned two-component (\u03c8, \u03c7)\nwavefunctions in the SO(12) local models, and one of the two components correspond to the\nsingle component (\u03c8, \u03c7) wavefunction in the SU(6)H \u2283 SU(5)GUT gauge theory, and the other\ncomponent to the single component wavefunction in the SU(6)M \u2283 SU(5)GUT gauge theory.\nThe trilinear couplings (59) are calculated by overlap integration in the SO(12) gauge theory,\nand the overlap integration picks up both of the two components. Thus, the couplings would\nvanish if zero modes that may be classified as \"H 0(c\u0304(D\u0304L) ; F(D\u0304L) )\" had vanishing wavefunction\nin the SU(6)H gauge theory. We have learnt in the previous paragraph, however, that this is\nnot the case. Therefore, the trilinear couplings are indeed generated, even after tuning the\ncomplex structure of a 4-fold X so that (a23 A4 + a25 y\u22172 ) vanish at all the points satisfying (91).\nOf course the value of the (D\u0304, L)-like wavefunction may well be small in the SU(6)H gauge\ntheory along c\u0304(H) far away from the points satisfying (91). The question is whether such a\nmixing of the wavefunction is small enough to satisfy a phenomenological constraint,\n\u221a\n\n\u03bb\u2032\u2032 \u03bb\u2032 . 10\u221213 ,\n\n(102)\n\nwhich comes from experimental lower bounds on the proton lifetime. To make an estimate\nof the size of the trilinear couplings generated in this scenario, we make a conservative\nassumption that the zero-mode wavefunctions decrease as in Gaussian profile far away from\nthe points satisfying (91). Then, the wavefunction of the (D\u0304, L)-like matter fields along the\nc\u0304(H) branch at a (a5 , a3 ) = (0, 0) point is expected to be of order\n\u2212( L\nd)\n\ne\n\n2\n\n\u2212\n\n> e\n\n\u2243 10\n\n\"\n\nRGUT\nd\n\n\u22122.1\n\n\"2\n\n\u2212\n\n=e\n\n1\n(M\u2217 d)2\n\nr\n\n\u2243 10\n\nR4\n1\nGUT\n2\ngs l4\ns (M\u2217 d)\n\n\u221213.\n\n1/(2\u03c0)\n(M\u2217 d)2\n\n\u2243 10\u221284.(\n\n1/(2\u03c0) 2\nM\u2217 d\n\n).\n\n(103)\n\nHere, d is the width of the Gaussian profile, L is a distance to a point where (a5 , a3 ) =\n(0, 0), which is always smaller than RGUT . Since the size of S is finite, not infinitely large,\nwavefunctions cannot be smaller than the value given above; the ratio between the Kaluza\u2013\nKlein radius and the width of localized wavefunctions sets the smallest possible value of\ntrilinear couplings (c.f. [3]). For a rough estimate at the first try, we have used (RGUT M\u2217 )2\nfor (RGUT /d)2 , and we know its value from (21). Given the three crude estimates above,\n\u221a\nwhich correspond to d \u223c 1/M\u2217 , 1/( 2\u03c0M\u2217 ) and 1/(2\u03c0M\u2217 ), it is therefore crucial to know the\nrelation between d and 1/M\u2217 more precisely, to see if this scenario can be a viable solution\nto the dimension-4 proton decay problem.\n\n40\n\n\fLet us suppose that the local defining equation is\ny 2 \u2243 x2 + z 5 (f u + z + * * * ),\n\n(104)\n\nwhere local coordinates u, z are made dimensionless by some unit length l\u2217 , and f is a\ndimensionless numerical coefficient. This equation describes a geometry near a matter curve\nat u = 0. To be a little more general, we can think of a spectral surface given by\nf u + \u03be + * * * = 0,\n\n(105)\n\nwhere the fiber coordinate \u03be of KS is also dimensionless. It is natural to imagine that the\ndimensionless coefficient f is of order unity, although it should be an issue to be confirmed\nultimately by flux compactification. Since the geometry in (104) allows for an interpretation\nas an intersecting D7\u2013D7 system, we can determine the 2\u03b1\u03c612 field vev for (104), without\nan ambiguity in the normalization. Using the fact that the mass of an open string state\nstretching a distance D is\n1\nm=\nD,\n(106)\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\nwe find34 that 2\u03b1\u03c612 = (4\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 )\u22121 f u\u2032 , where u\u2032 \u2261 ul\u2217 is the local coordinate with a physical\n\u2032 \u22121\n\u2032 2\nmass dimension \u22121 restored. Corresponding Gaussian wavefunction is e\u2212(4\u03c0\u03b1 ) f |u | . The\n\u221a\ntypical width parameter, therefore, turns out to be d \u223c 4\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 . If we further make a crude\n\u221a\napproximation35 gs \u223c O(1), then d \u223c 1/( \u03c0M\u2217 ), and36\n\u00132\n\u0012\n\u03c0\n1\nRGUT\n\u223c \u03c0(RGUT M\u2217 )2 = \u221a\n\u2243\n\u2243 15..\n(107)\nd\n\u03b1GUT\n0.06\nThus, we have a lower bound on the R-parity violating trilinear couplings:\n\u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 , \u03bb\u2032\u2032 & 10\u22127 .\n\n(108)\n\nGiven the so many crude approximations we have made (especially gs \u223c O(1) and f \u223c O(1)),\nthe inconsistency between the phenomenological limit (102) and the lower bound (108) should\nnot be taken as an argument excluding the scenario in this section 4.3.2. One should also\nkeep in mind, however, that the lower bound (108) is based on an inequality L < RGUT that\nis virtually never saturated, and furthermore, wavefunctions do not always damp as fast as\nin the Gaussian profile; see [9] and the appendix of this article.\n34\n\nSee the appendix of [9] for details on the normalization convention.\nSee footnote 5.\n\u221a\n36\nThis parameter (d/RGUT )2 \u223c \u03b1GUT /\u03c0 may also sets the hierarchical scale of flavor physics (c.f. [43]).\n35\n\n41\n\n\fIf this scenario is phenomenologically acceptable, then the neutrino Yukawa couplings are\ngenerated around the codimension-3 singularity points at the points satisfying (91), because\nthat is where the wavefunctions of lepton doublets L \u2282 (D\u0304, L) and Hu \u2282 H(5) are not small.\nRight-handed neutrinos are identified either with H 3,1 or H 1,2 in this scenario. The Yukawa\ncouplings can be calculated by the SU(7) gauge theory local model, and the wavefunctions of\nright-handed neutrinos can be dealt with as in the prescription given in section 3. Majorana\nmasses are generated for the H 3,1 moduli from flux compactification, as we have explained\nin section 2.\n4.3.3\n\nyet another limit of reducible spectral surface\n\nIn order to safely remove the mixing of the wavefunction altogether between the Hd \u2282 H\u0304(5\u0304)like matter and L \u2282 (D\u0304, L)-like matter fields, one should consider a limit where the spectral\nsurface C(5\u0304) is reducible:\nC(5\u0304) = C(D\u0304L) + C(H) ,\n(109)\nwhere the \u03be = 0 loci of C(D\u0304L) and C(H) become the matter curves c\u0304(D\u0304L) and c\u0304(H) in (86),\nrespectively. The zero-mode wavefunctions of the L \u2282 (D\u0304, L)-like matter becomes absolutely\nzero on the C(H) piece of C(5\u0304) in this case, and hence the couplings of the dimension-4 proton\ndecay operators vanish.37\nIn the SU(7) gauge theory which models the local geometry around points satisfying (91),\nthis factorisation of the spectral surface is realized by further tuning complex structure so\nthat A = 1 in (101). The two pieces C(D\u0304L) (\u03be + u = 0) and C(H) (\u03be + v = 0) intersect along\nu = v = \u2212\u03be, and form a double curve singularity. Since the gauge group of this local model\nis AN -type, a natural Type IIB interpretation exists; this double curve singularity is nothing\nbut D7\u2013D7 intersection.\nNow remember that the H 3,1 and H 1,2 moduli fields are captured as Ext1 (i\u2217 N(10) , i\u2217 N(10) )\nin KS in the field theory local models, where i\u2217 N(10) [resp. N(10) ] is the Higgs sheaf [resp.\nline bundle supported on the spectral surface C(10) ] for the fields in the SU(5)GUT -10 representation. The double curve singularity in the spectral surface C(5\u0304) (other than those in\nthe local models around codimension-3 singularity points of A4 \u2192 D6 enhancement) for the\n37\n\nThe factorization limit of the spectral surface (109) here does not have an easy interpretation within\nthe E8 gauge theory in the dual Heterotic language. This is not a reducible limit of a vector bundle in an\nE8 ; it is easy to see this because the tuning required in section 4.3.2 is to set y\u22172 = x3\u2217 + f0 x\u2217 + g0 = 0 at\nthe points satisfying (91), and this condition involves not just moduli of the spectral surface, but also the\ncomplex structure parameter f0 and g0 of the elliptic fibration.\n\n42\n\n\ffields in the SU(5)-5\u0304 representation indicates that the spectral surface C(10) for the fields in\nthe SU(5)GUT -10 representation also has a double curve singularity. C(10) is not irreducible,\nbut it also splits into C1 + C2 . Then, the Higgs sheaf V = i\u2217 N(10) also splits as i1\u2217 N1 + i2\u2217 N2 ,\nand the moduli fields also split as in (70). The last two components in (70) are localized\nat the intersection of the two pieces, or intuitively, the D7\u2013D7 intersection curve. In the\nabsence of ramification of the spectral surface, we purely have an SU(7) field theory local\nmodel. Open string interaction generates neutrino Yukawa couplings for the one of the last\ntwo components above, which correspond to the off-diagonal pieces in the 2 by 2 block of the\n7 by 7 matrix of SU(7). We have thus arrived at the picture assumed in [10].\nIt is not obvious whether there is a global unbroken U(1) symmetry as an explanation for\nthe absence of dimension-4 proton decay in this scenario with a factorized spectral surface.\nThis is a crucial question because the Majorana masses of the right-handed neutrinos are\nforbidden as long as such an unbroken U(1) symmetry exists. At least, in the local field\ntheory models with SO(12) and SU(7) gauge groups, the spectral surface for the fields in the\nSU(5)-5\u0304 representation does not ramify, and one can find U(1) symmetry transformations\nin these gauge theories, where the lepton doublets and Hd have distinct charges under the\nU(1)'s.38 It is not obvious, however, whether one should maintain such a U(1) symmetry\nin all the field theory local models of the patches covering the A4 singularity surface S; the\nfactorization limit of the spectral surface (109) is sufficient in removing all the dimension-4\nproton decay operators, and it is not clear if the factorization limit immediately implies the\nexistence of a U(1) symmetry in the effective theory. If it does not, then we do not strictly\nneed a symmetry.39\nEven more controversial is whether the factorization limit (109) is well-defined. The\nspectral surface of Higgs bundle is defined in F-theory compactifications only in field theory\nlocal models. One can choose field theory local models with SU(6) or SO(10) gauge groups\nalong the matter curves, and local models can be chosen with gauge groups SU(7), SO(12)\nand E6 at codimension-3 singularity points. These choices, however, are just a the minimal\nchoice preserving essential features of the local geometries. For higher level of approximation,\nlocal models can be replaced by gauge theories with higher-rank gauge groups. For example,\n38\n\nWhether an associated U(1) gauge symmetry remains massless and anomaly free in low-energy effective\ntheory is yet another (and often global) issue, and we will not discuss here.\n39\nIt certainly goes against a common sense of field theory model building to claim that certain operators\nare absent without an explanation in terms of symmetry, but such things may or may not happen in string\ntheory. We do not have any arguments in favor of or against such a mechanism of vanishing couplings without\na symmetry reason.\n\n43\n\n\fin F-theory compactifications with Heterotic dual, one can choose E8 gauge theory as local\nmodels at any patches of S (or even globally on S), not just the minimal rank-1 or rank-2\nextension of the common SU(5)GUT over S. Even in F-theory compactifications with Heterotic\ndual, however, it is a good approximation to cut out the rank-5 Higgs bundle from the rest\nonly in the stable degeneration limit. If the complex structure moduli are not necessarily\nin this limit, then taking just the rank-5 part into the field theory formulation on S and\ndiscarding all the rest is not a systematically justified approximation. How can one extend\nthe gauge group of the local models beyond E8 to achieve a higher level of approximation\nwithin the field theory formulation? The situation is essentially the same in generic F-theory\ncompactifications; field theory local models can capture local geometry of X near the A4\nsingularity surface S, but the field theory formulation does not offer a systematic way (order\nby order) to capture the entire geometry of X for higher level of approximation. The field\ntheory formulation can capture only a local geometry that is approximately a deformed ADE\nsingularity fibered over a local patch of S. The whole geometry of X is compact and is not\nan ALE fibration on S. Since the spectral surfaces of the Higgs bundles can be defined only\nwithin the field theory local models, the reducibility (factorization) of the spectral surfaces\ncan also be defined order by order in this approximation, which will never be able to cover\nthe entire geometry of X. At this moment, we do not have a clear idea40 how to define the\nfactorization limit (109) rigorously. For the real-world physics, however, the constraints from\nphenomenology (102) always leave a room for very small couplings for the dimension-4 proton\ndecay operators. Thus, it may be an option to enforce factorization limit in gauge theory\nlocal models with higher-rank gauge groups so that sufficiently high level of approximation\nis achieved, and trilinear couplings as small as 10\u221213 can be discussed.\nBefore closing this section 4.3, we comment on a variation of the scenario that has been\ndiscussed so far. We have discussed this scenario along the line of (86), where neither Hu \u2282\nH(5) nor Hd \u2282 H\u0304(5\u0304) are localized in the irreducible curve c\u0304(D\u0304L) . As a solution to the\ndimension-4 proton decay problem, however, only the distinction between Hd and the three\nlepton doublets is essential. Thus, Hu may originate from the same curve as the lepton\n40\n\nThe factorization (reducibility) of the spectral surface in the SU(7) local models is the same as the\nfactorization of the discriminant locus. Thus, it might seem at first sight that the factorization condition of the\nspectral surface can be replaced by the factorization condition of the discriminant locus. But these conditions\nare actually totally different. As explained in section 4.3 of [9], the spectral surface for the SU(5)GUT -5\u0304\nrepresentation fields consists of two irreducible pieces in the SO(12) local models around the codimension-3\nsingularities with enhanced D6 singularity, whereas the corresponding discriminant locus consists of a single\nirreducible piece.\n\n44\n\n\fdoublets. That is, we can consider another reducible limit,41\nc\u0304(5\u0304) \u2192 c\u0304(D\u0304LHu) + c\u0304(Hd) ,\n\nC(5\u0304) \u2192 C(D\u0304LHu) + C(Hd) .\n\n(110)\n\nThis is theoretically possible; what was discussed in [61] is essentially the same thing from\ntheoretical perspectives. In this new factorization scenario, neutrino Yukawa couplings are\ngenerated just as in section 3, and the H 3,1(X; C) moduli have Majorana masses, just as in\nsection 2. There is nothing to worry about the Majorana masses in the absence of possible\nprotection by a U(1) symmetry. Neutrino Yukawa couplings have contributions all along the\ncurve c\u0304(D\u0304LHu) , and the Majorana masses come from the entire bulk of B3 . The \u2206W = SHu Hd\ninteraction of the NMSSM, on the other hand, is localized at the points satisfying (91) in\nthis factorization limit, if such a massless singlet chiral multiplet S exists in the spectrum.\nPhenomenology of supersymmetry breaking terms in the scenarios in this section 4.3 is\nbeyond the scope of this article.\n\n4.4\n\nR-parity Violating Scenarios\n\nAn unbroken U(1) symmetry is powerful in removing the dimension-4 proton decay operators,\nbut it also forbids the Majorana mass terms of right-handed neutrinos. That would be the\nexecutive summary of section 4.2, and may be also of the C(D\u0304L) +C(HuHd) splitting scenario in\nsection 4.3. If we could find a field \u03c6 with even units of charge of an unbroken U(1) symmetry,\nthen an unbroken Z2 symmetry would be found after spontaneous breaking of the U(1) by a\nvev of the field h\u03c6i, but one still has to find how trilinear couplings \u2206W = \u03c6NN like (60)\nwould be generated. We have not found a way to discover such fields and such couplings.42\nIf one throws away the U(1) symmetry altogether and just impose a Z2 symmetry from the\nbeginning, then that is the Z2 parity scenario in section 4.1.\nActually there is a caveat in this argument, however. Suppose that we begin with a\ncompactification that leaves an unbroken U(1) symmetry. This U(1) symmetry can be broken\nspontaneously by vev's only of chiral multiplets with, for example, positive U(1) charges.\nLet us denote such chiral multiplets as \u03c6+ . We assume that all the fields with negative\ncharges under the U(1) symmetry do not have non-vanishing vev's. Suppose that righthanded neutrinos N\u0304 have a negative U(1) charge, while the U(1) charge of the dimension-4\nproton decay operators 5\u0304 10 5\u0304 is positive. Then the Majorana masses of right-handed\n41\n42\n\nThe factorization condition of the spectral surface may be relaxed to the level of tuning in section 4.3.2.\nA caveat in this argument is mentioned at the end of section 4.2.\n\n45\n\n\fneutrinos are allowed by the spontaneously broken symmetry, because the effective Majorana\nmass parameter MR can involve the vev's with positive U(1) charges, MR \u223c h\u03c6+ in . On\nthe other hand, the dimension-4 proton decay operators are still forbidden by the broken\nsymmetry, because of the absence of chiral multiplet vev's with negative U(1) charges.43\nSupersymmetric D-term condition can be satisfied for this U(1) symmetry, because the vev's\nof the positively charge field can balance against a negative Fayet\u2013Iliopoulos parameter \u03be\nproportional to \u03c9 \u2227 F .\nThis scenario was proposed in [1], and studied in detail in [59]. Study in [1, 59] was done\nmostly in language of Heterotic string compactification. Although two of the authors (RT\nand TW) made an effort to provide a description of this scenario in F-theory language as\nwell in [1], various theoretical aspects of F-theory compactifications and the duality between\nHeterotic string and F-theory were not as clearly understood back then as they are now, and\nthe translation from Heterotic description to F-theory description was not completed there.\nWith a better theoretical understanding of F-theory compactification, we now provide a little\nbetter version.\nIn the language of Heterotic E8 \u00d7 E8 string compactification on a Calabi\u2013Yau 3-fold Z,\nthe key idea of [1] was to use a rank-5 vector bundle V5 with a structure\n0 \u2192 L\u03c7 \u2192 V5 \u2192 U4 \u2192 0\n\nor\n\n0 \u2192 U2 \u2192 V5 \u2192 U3 \u2192 0.\n\n(111)\n(112)\n\nHere, L\u03c7 [resp. U2 ] is a rank-1 [resp. rank-2] sub-bulde of V5 , whose structure group is\nSU(5)str \u2282 E8 . Zero mode chiral multiplets in the SU(5)GUT -5\u0304 representation are H 1 (Z; \u22272 V5 )\nin general Heterotic string compactifications, but for V5 with such a sub-bundle as above, a\nsubspace\nH 1 (Z; L \u2297 V5 ) \u2282 H 1 (Z; \u22272 V5 )\n\nH 1 (Z; U2 \u2297 V5 ) \u2282 H 1 (Z; \u22272 V5 )\n\nor\n\n(113)\n\nis well-defined, and this subspace is identified with the (D\u0304, L)-type matter fields; the Hd \u2282\nH\u0304(5\u0304) field, on the other hand, is regarded as a generic element of H 1 (Z; \u22272 V5 ). Chiral\nmultiplets 10 = (Q, \u016a, \u0112) are identified with H 1 (Z; U2 ) \u2282 H 1 (Z; V5 ) in the case (112). All of\nthe down-type/charged lepton Yukawa couplings and the dimension-4 proton decay operators\noriginate from the product\nH 1 (Z; \u22272 V5 ) \u00d7 H 1 (Z; V5 ) \u00d7 H 1 (Z; \u22272 V5 ) \u2192 H 3 (Z; \u22275 V5 ) = H 0,3 (Z; C)\n43\n\n(114)\n\nThis selection rule is applied to, and only to, renormalizable operators in low-energy effective theories\nbelow the Kaluza\u2013Klein scale. See [62, 59] for the discussion.\n\n46\n\n\fin the Heterotic string superpotential\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n2\n\u2206WHet =\n\u03a9 \u2227 tr AdA + i AAA .\n3\nZ\n\n(115)\n\nThe product vanishes when both of the H 1 (Z; \u22272 V5 ) elements are in the subspace (113), and\nhence the dimension-4 proton decay operators are absent. See [1, 59] for more about this\nscenario.\nThe extension structures (111, 112) can be regarded as spontaneous breaking of U(1)\nsymmetries.44 A rank-5 vector bundle L\u03c7 \u2295 U4 [resp. U2 \u2295 U3 ] has a structure group SU(4) \u00d7\nU(1)\u03c7 \u2282 SU(5)str [resp. SU(2)\u00d7SU(3)\u00d7 U(1)q\u03037 ]. The structure group in both cases has a U(1)\nR\nfactor. The rank-5 bundle V5 is unstable, if the Fayet\u2013Iliopoulos parameter \u03be \u221d Z \u03c9 \u2227 \u03c9 \u2227 F\nof the U(1) symmetry does not vanish. In the case (111), for example, we assume that \u03be\u03c7 is\nc\nnegative, and chiral multiplets N \u2208 H 1 (Z; L\u03c7 \u2297 U 4 ) \u2282 H 1(Z; adj(V5 )) with positive U(1)\u03c7\ncharge Q\u03c7 absorb the Fayet\u2013Iliopoulos parameter. This is why L\u03c7 remains a well-defined\nsub-bundle, but U4 does not.\nHeterotic string compactification has an F-theory dual, when the Calabi\u2013Yau 3-fold Z is\nan elliptic fibration\n\u03c0Z : Z \u2192 S\n(116)\nover a complex surface S. In the following, we start from a Heterotic compactification on\nsuch a Calabi\u2013Yau 3-fold Z with a vector bundle V5 constructed from a pair of vector bundle\n(L\u03c7 , U4 ) or (U2 , U3 ) as above, and find out its F-theory dual description.\nBilinear R-parity violation [56] is generated in the scenario explained above [59]. An\norder of magnitude estimate of the bilinear R-parity violating parameters was given in [59],\nusing weakly coupled Heterotic string compactification. R-parity violating decay of gravitino\ndark matter has been discussed as one of the possible explanations of the recent cosmic ray\nanomalies [63].\n4.4.1\n\nsub-bundle with vanishing first Chern class in the fiber\n\nAn F-theory dual description of this scenario becomes quite different, depending on whether\nc1 (L\u03c7 ) = \u2212c1 (U4 ) [resp. c1 (U2 ) = \u2212c1 (U3 )] vanishes in the elliptic fiber direction of (116), or\nit is strictly negative [1]. Let us begin with the case with vanishing first Chern classes in the\nfiber direction.\n44\n\nNot all of vector bundles with sub-bundles may admit such an interpretation. The following discussion,\ntherefore, should be taken for granted only for bundles that can be constructed that way.\n\n47\n\n\fIn this case, bundles U1,2 (U1 \u2261 L\u03c7 hereafter) and U4,3 may be given by Fourier\u2013Mukai\ntransform separately. The spectral data, (Ck , Nk ) (k = 1, 2, 4, 3), for Heterotic compactification can readily be used for the spectral data of Higgs bundles in F-theory compactification\n[9]. The case V5 = U4 \u2295 U1 (with a vanishing Fayet\u2013Iliopoulos parameter \u03be\u03c7 even on the base\nspace S) then corresponds to the SO(10) scenario in section 4.2, and V5 = U3 \u2295 U2 to the\nSU(6) scenario in section 4.2.\nDiscussion in section 4.2 corresponds to Higgs bundles in F-theory compactification\nwhere both \u03c9 \u2227 F and [\u03c6, \u03c6] vanish in the the first one of the BPS conditions (38). More\ngeneral, however, is Higgs bundles where the first condition is satisfied as a combination\n\u03c9 \u2227 F \u2212 |\u03b1|2 [\u03c6, \u03c6]/2, but not separately. This corresponds to non-vanishing Fayet\u2013Iliopoulos\nparameter for the U(1)\u03c7 [U(1)q\u03037 ] symmetry; non-vanishing Fayet\u2013Iliopoulos parameter is\nequivalent to \u03c9 \u2227 F 6= 0. The Fayet\u2013Iliopoulos parameter triggers spontaneous breaking\nof the U(1) symmetry; if the parameter is negative [resp. positive], then chiral multiplets\nwith positive [resp. negative] U(1) charge have tachyonic masses, and develop non-vanishing\nexpectation values, which makes the [\u03c6, \u03c6] term non-zero. In the end, stable minimum with\nvanishing D-term potential is equivalent to a (A, \u03c6) field configuration on S satisfying the\nBPS conditions.\nc\nIn the SO(10) scenario, for example, only the positively charged chiral multiplets N\nneed to develop non-zero vev's, in order to cancel the negative Fayet\u2013Iliopoulos parameter,\nand N remains zero. The h\u03c6i configuration now have non-zero off-diagonal entries in the\n5 \u00d7 5 matrix representation as in (32), but not in a way the spectral surface is affected. As\nc\nc\ndiscussed in section 4.2, only the vev of N N modify the spectral surface; N alone do\nnot. The spectral surface only extracts information associated with eigenvalues of h\u03c6i, but\nsymmetry breaking pattern in Higgs bundle is not always encoded only by the eigenvalues45\nof h\u03c6i.\nIn the SO(10) scenario, a rank-1 bundle L\u03c7 remains a \u03c6-invariant sub\u2013Higgs-bundle of\nthe rank-5 Higgs bundle on S. In the SU(6) scenario, a rank-2 sub-Higgs-bundle remains\n\u03c6-invariant. The rank-5 Higgs bundle in these scenarios are, so to speak, constructed by\nthe parabolic construction on S; see section 5 of [28] for the parabolic construction of vector\nbundles on elliptic fibered Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds Z.\nMajorana mass terms of right-handed neutrinos can be generated in such a vacuum as\n45\n\nSee also [47], where nilpotent Higgs vev is discussed in Type IIB compactifications.\n\n48\n\n\flong as an effective theory has a non-renormalizable term\nc\n\nc\n\n\u2206W = NN N N .\n\n(117)\n\nc\n\nEither N or N develop non-vanishing expectation values to balance the non-vanishing Fayet\u2013\nIliopoulos parameter \u03be \u221d \u03c9 \u2227 F , and then the counter part acquire Majorana masses [1, 59].\nThis term also lifts the D-flat direction of the U(1) symmetry [64].\nTwo independent origins of the effective interaction (117) have been discussed [1, 65, 59]\nin language of Heterotic string compactification. One of them [65, 59] is that the interaction\n(117) is generated in effective theory, when Kaluza\u2013Klein modes are integrated out of a\nfield theory description. The superpotential (115) contains interactions not only of Kaluza\u2013\nKlein zero modes, but also Kaluza\u2013Klein mass terms (the mass parameter coming from the\nderivative d) and trilinear interactions involving the Kaluza\u2013Klein modes.\nX\nX\nc\nW =\nMI \u03a6I \u03a6I +\n\u03bbI N \u03a6I N + * * * .\n(118)\nI\n\nI\n\nNon-renormalizable terms like (117) are generated in the effective theory, when the Kaluza\u2013\nKlein modes \u03a6I are integrated out (c.f. [25]);\n!\nX \u03bb2\nc c\nI\n\u2206W =\nN NN N .\n(119)\nM\nI\nI\nThere is no reason to doubt that the same thing happens in F-theory compactifications,\nbecause the superpotential for F-theory (46) is essentially the same as that of the Heterotic\nstring compactification (115); only difference is that the F-theory superpotential (46) has\nKaluza\u2013Klein modes on S alone, not on the Kaluza\u2013Klein modes on Calabi\u2013Yau 3-folds, but\nthe Kaluza\u2013Klein modes on S should be enough in generating interactions like (117). Thus,\nthe Majorana mass terms are generated for the right-handed neutrinos in F-theory compactifications also in the SO(10) and SU(6) scenarios with a non-vanishing Fayet\u2013Iliopoulos\nparameter.\nThe mass scale of the Majorana mass is given approximately by\nMR \u223c\n\n(\u03bb hNi)2\n\u03be\n\u223c \u03bb2\n,\nMKK\nMKK\n\n(120)\n\nwhere \u03be is the Fayet\u2013Iliopoulos parameter. The Fayet\u2013Iliopoulos parameter has been calculated in Type IIB Calabi\u2013Yau orientifold compactifications. Applying the result of [66] naively\n\n49\n\n\fe is like C \u00d7 S, and vol(B)\ne = vol(C) \u00d7 vol(S) = R2 R4\nfor a case a Calabi\u2013Yau 3-fold B\n\u22a5 GUT (like\nin the tubular model of Fig. 1 (b)), and restoring proper dimensionality and gs dependence,\nwe obtain\ngs ls4\n2 1\n\u03be \u223c MPl\n.\n(121)\n2\n2\n\u03c0 RGUT\nR\u22a5\nSince this expression comes in a combination gs ls4 = 1/M\u22174 , which remains constant (relatively\nto l11 ) everywhere in B3 in generic F-theory compactifications, we dare to use this expression\nfor F-theory compactifications that are not necessarily Type IIB Calabi\u2013Yau orientifolds.\nThis estimate of the Fayet\u2013Iliopoulos parameter is simplified by using (21\u201323) as\n2\n\u03be \u223c 4M\u22174 RGUT\n\u223c\n\n2\nMGUT\n.\n\u03b1GUT c2\n\n4\n\n(122)\n\nThis result perfectly agrees with the Heterotic result in [1], up to a factor of O(1) that\nwe did not care about here. This result does not depend on R\u22a5 or on the geometry in\nc\nthe direction transverse to S. Canonically normalized zero modes |N | [resp. |N|] develop\np\nvev's of order |\u03be|, meaning that the original Higgs bundle that corresponds to U4 \u2295 U1\n[resp. U3 \u2295 U2 ] receives an order-one correction to become a Higgs bundle with the extension\nstructure as in (111, 112). An estimate of the Majorana masses of right-handed neutrinos\nis obtained by plugging the estimate of \u03be in (120). Typical value of the trilinear couplings\n\u03bbI in (118) are of order gGUT with suppression factors coming from overlap integration of\nnormalized wavefunctions (c.f [3] for more details). The overlap integration tends to be\nsmaller in the trilinear couplings like those in (118) (c.f. [59]), because the overlap integral\ninvolves two almost \"flat wavefunctions\" for two zero modes and one \"higher Fourier mode\"\nfor the Kaluza\u2013Klein states. Two gGUT coming from \u03bb2 cancel those in 1/\u03b1GUT in \u03be, and the\nmass scale of right-handed neutrinos in this scenario is somewhere around the GUT scale\nwith a suppression factor coming from the overlap integrals. This result fits very well with\nphenomenological expectation (4).\nThe other known mechanism for generating (117) is the world-sheet instanton effect in the\nlanguage of Heterotic string compactification [64, 1]. Although such world-sheet instanton\neffects are known to cancel for certain class of (0,2) Heterotic compactifications, there may\nbe other choices of geometries other than in such a class, and one does not have to rule this\npossibility out. A world-sheet instanton contribution from a curve \u03a3 in the base surface\nS in Heterotic theory corresponds in F-theory [67] to M5-brane (Euclidean D3) instanton\ncontribution from a divisor of B3 that is projected on to the same curve of S in the P1\n\n50\n\n\ffibration\n\u03c0B3 : B3 \u2192 S.\n\n(123)\n\nAn exponential suppression factor associated with this non-perturbative effect is of order\n\u0013\n\u0012\nvol(\u03a3)\n\u2212 \u03b1 2\u03c0 12\n\u2212[(2\u03c0)M\u22174 R2GUT R2\u22a5 ]|F\nGUT \u01eb\n=\ne\n=\ne\nexp \u2212\n\u2243 10\u2212660 ,\n(124)\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\nHet\nand is too small to be relevant for phenomenology. However, this estimate is very crude, and\ndoes not take account of a possibility that there may be a collapsed divisor in B3 . Thus, this\nestimate does not completely exclude a possibility that the effective interactions (117) are\ngenerated by M5-brane instanton effects.\nWe have so far discussed this R-parity violating scenario in F-theory compactification, by\nstarting from a class of Heterotic string compactifications, and translating into F-theory language using the duality. Rank-5 vector bundles in Heterotic compactification on a Calabi\u2013Yau\n3-fold Z are translated into rank-5 Higgs bundles on a base 2-fold S for F-theory compactification. The extension structure of the vector bundles (and hence the subspace structure\nof the zero modes) in Heterotic theory is carried over to F-theory compactification as the\nextension structure of the Higgs bundles (and as the subspace structure of the zero modes).\nThis way of understanding, however, raises a question whether this scenario is possible only\nin F-theory compactification with Heterotic dual. In F-theory compactification with a Heterotic dual, a Higgs bundle with a fixed rank can be defined globally on S. Generic F-theory\ncompactifications, however, have field theory local models only locally on S, and physics\nassociated with S (that is, GUT physics) has to be recovered by gluing those local models\ntogether. Since the nature of gluing process is at most approximate, there is a concern that\nthe notion of sub-Higgs-bundle may not be well-defined globally on S. If so, that would\nbe a problem, given the severe constraint on the couplings of the dimension-4 proton decay\noperators.\nIn each local field theory model of a generic F-theory compactification, however, there\nis a well-defined U(1) symmetry: U(1)\u03c7 in the SO(10) scenario, and U(1)q\u03037 in the SU(6)\nscenario. The absence of the dimension-4 proton decay operators is guaranteed by the U(1)\nsymmetry broken only by positively [resp. negatively] charged fields, and hence the R-parity\nviolating scenario in this section 4.4.1 is available not just for F-theory compactifications\nwith Heterotic dual.46\n46\n\nThe estimate of the suppression factor of M5-brane instanton effect can be a little more moderate in\ngeneric F-theory compactifications, as (1/\u01eb\u03b3=1 )2 in (124) may be replaced by (1/\u01eb\u03b3=1/3 )2 in the homogeneous\n\n51\n\n\f4.4.2\n\nsub-bundle with non-vanishing first Chern class in the fiber\n\nLet us now study the F-theory dual description of the scenario explained at the beginning\nof this section 4.4, in the case the first Chern class in the elliptic fiber direction does not\nvanish. For stability of V5 , c1 (U1,2 )|T 2 = \u2212c1 (U4,3 )|T 2 is negative.47 We will consider a region\nof the moduli space where the K\u00e4hler class of the T 2 fiber is smaller than those of the base\nS. This is where the Heterotic\u2013F theory duality with 16 SUSY charges can be promoted to\nthe duality with smaller number of SUSY charges adiabatically.\nSince the bundles U1,2 and U4,3 have non-vanishing first Chern classes in the fiber direction,\nthey are not given by spectral cover construction. It is thus non-trivial to see even such a\nthing as whether the charged matter fields are localized in the F-theory dual description. Let\nus begin with addressing this question.\nBecause c1 (U1,2 ) in the fiber direction is negative, and c1 (U4,3 )|T 2 positive, R0 \u03c0Z\u2217 U1,2 and\nR1 \u03c0Z\u2217 U4,3 vanish. Since V5 restricted on a fiber becomes a flat bundle, and is non-trivial\ngenerically, R0 \u03c0Z\u2217 V5 = 0. Thus, this exact sequence follows:\n0 \u2212\u2192 R0 \u03c0Z\u2217 U4,3 \u2212\u2192 R1 \u03c0Z\u2217 U1,2 \u2212\u2192 R1 \u03c0Z\u2217 V5 \u2212\u2192 0.\n\n(125)\n\nThe support of the sheaves R0 \u03c0Z\u2217 U4,3 and R1 \u03c0Z\u2217 U1,2 is the entire S, but the support of\nR1 \u03c0Z\u2217 V5 can be a curve in S. The map from R0 \u03c0Z\u2217 U4,3 to R1 \u03c0Z\u2217 U1,2 is to multiply a global\nsection of R1 \u03c0Z\u2217 adj.V5 = R1 \u03c0Z\u2217 (U 4,3 \u2297 U1,2 ), which describes how U4,3 are extended by U1,2\nto become V5 in each fiber. Remember [28] that the moduli of this global holomorphic section\n\u2217\nis identified with that of the spectral surface, when U4,3 and U1,2 are bundles W4,3 and W1,2\n\u2217\nconstructed in [28] and Wk \u2295 W5\u2212k\n(k = 4, 3) is minimally unstable. The support of R1 \u03c0Z\u2217 V5\nis where the extension of U4,3 in the T 2 fiber by U1,2 becomes less non-trivial.\nMassless matter fields in the SU(5)GUT -10 representation are identified with H 1 (Z; V5 ) \u2243\nH 0(S; R1 \u03c0Z\u2217 V5 ). Using the exact sequence (125), one finds a following long exact sequence\nwhere H 0 (S; R1 \u03c0Z\u2217 V5 ) is in:\n0 \u2192 H 0 (S; R0 \u03c0Z\u2217 U4,3 ) \u2192 H 0 (S; R1 \u03c0Z\u2217 U1,2 ) \u2192 H 0 (S; R1 \u03c0Z\u2217 V5 )\n\u2192 H 1 (S; R0 U4,3 ) \u2192 H 1 (S; R1 \u03c0Z\u2217 U1,2 ).\n\n(126)\n\nmodel. This does not make a practical difference, though, as the exponential suppression factor remains\nextremely small.\n47\nSection 5 of [28] explains in detail how to construct a vector bundle V5 on an elliptic fibered Calabi\u2013\n\u2217\n\u2217\nYau manifold, using a vector bundle Wk for U4,3 and W5\u2212k\nfor U1,2 . The bundles Wk and Wn\u2212k\nsatisfy\n\u2217\nc1 (Wk )|T 2 = \u2212c1 (Wn\u2212k )|T 2 = 1.\n\n52\n\n\fThus, H 1 (Z; V5 ) \u2243 H 0 (S; R1 \u03c0Z\u2217 V5 ) has a subspace\nCoker(H 0 (S; R0 \u03c0Z\u2217 U4,3 ) \u2192 H 0 (S; R1 \u03c0Z\u2217 U1,2 )),\n\n(127)\n\nand the quotient by this subspace is\nKer(H 1 (S; R0 \u03c0Z\u2217 U4,3 ) \u2192 H 1 (S; R1 \u03c0Z\u2217 U1,2 )).\n\n(128)\n\nThe vector space of the zero modes, H 0 (S; R1 \u03c0Z\u2217 V5 ), has a subspace structure like (113).\nA chain complex (125) is regarded as the essence of this subspace structure in F-theory\nlanguage.\nSimilar argument can be repeated for the zero modes in the SU(5)GUT -5\u0304 and -5 representations.48 The subspace structure of the zero modes (113) does follow for these representations.\nThe (D\u0304, L)-type fields are identified with this subspace. Since the trilinear couplings (59)\nvanish at least in Heterotic string compactifications with supergravity approximation, the\nsame should be true in the stable degeneration limit of F-theory compactifications that have\nHeterotic dual.\nMassless moduli fields coming from H 1 (S; R0 \u03c0Z\u2217 U4 \u2297 U1\u22121 ) have trilinear couplings with\nL \u2282 (D\u0304, L) \u2208 H 1 (Z; U1 \u2297 V5 ) and Hu \u2282 H(5) \u2208 H 1 (Z; \u22272 U 4 ) in the case with the structure (111). Thus, they are identified with the right-handed neutrinos N . Moduli fields\nc\nH 0(S; R1 \u03c0Z\u2217 U 4 \u2297 U1 ), denoted as N , do not have the couplings to be identified with\nthe neutrino Yukawa couplings. In the case with the structure (112), on the other hand,\nH 0(S; R1 \u03c0Z\u2217 U2 \u2297 U 3 ) is identified with the right-handed neutrinos N [1].\nMany issues are still beyond the scope of this article. We have not discussed whether\nthe dimension-4 proton decay operators are still protected in moduli space not necessarily at\nthe stable degeneration limit. Such issues as how important the world-sheet instanton effects\nwould become in small T 2 -fiber limit (in Heterotic language) or how to define the subspace\nstructure more rigorously despite the \"approximate\" nature of the field theory formulation\nof F-theory remain totally unaddressed. More detailed study of the structure of (125\u2013128)\nand that for R1 \u03c0Z\u2217 \u22272 V5 is also desirable.\n48\n\nA sequence of sheaves on S similar to (125) is derived for R1 \u03c0Z\u2217 \u22272 V5 , following the same line of\nargument as for R1 \u03c0Z\u2217 V5 . However, we have no idea how to construct something like a principal-bundle\nversion of such sequences for different representations.\n\n53\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nWe thank Teruhiko Kawano, with whom we maintained close communications during the\nentire period of this work.

Local geometry of Calabi\u2013\nYau 4-fold X and base 3-fold B3 containing a divisor S, the discriminant locus for the nonAbelian gauge fields in 3+1-dimensions, is encoded as the choice of gauge group in a local\nregion of S and a field vev in the field theory that models the local geometry [11, 6, 7, 9].\nSuch filed theories constructed in local patches of S are glued together to reproduce all the\ninformation encoded in the geometry of X and B3 . It is of crucial importance, therefore, to\nproperly translate the geometry into the field vev of field theory local models.\nThe choice of the field background for F-theory compactification on a Calabi\u2013Yau 3-fold\n(that is, the base manifold is a 2-fold, S is a curve and low-energy effective theory is on 5+1dimensions) is discussed in [11]. The codimension-1 locus where 1-form field \u03c6 on S vanishes\nis called matter locus. Nothing else to discuss. Upon compactification to 3+1 dimensions,\nhowever, one more extra complication appears [9]. Local geometry of X around S is regarded\nas fibered space with the fiber being a surface with (partially) deformed ADE singularity,\nbut the topological 2-cycles in the fiber have monodromies, and these monodromies introduce\nbranch cuts and monodromies under the Weyl group in the field thoery. Branch locus and\nmatter locus are both codimension-1 loci in a surface S, and hence their intersections become\npoints. These points are codimension-3 in B3 . It is inevitable to have these codimension-3\nsingularity points in compactification down to 3+1 dimensions. How to choose the vev of \u03c6\nfield around such codimension-3 singularity points actually still remains a bit of an issue.\nThe choice of \u03c6 vev around codimension-3 singularities was one of the main issues in\n[9]. Reference [45] further noted that the field theory local modes on S with branch cuts\nand the Weyl-group monodromies has equivalent descriptions on the covering space Se of S.\nThe latter description does not involve branch cuts or twists, and the former description is\nobtained by taking a quotient of the latter. The \u03c6 field vev configuration in [9] and that of\n[45] are largely the same under this identification, but there still is a difference. This is why\n\n54\n\n\fthe choice of \u03c6 for a given geometry around codimension-3 singularity points still remains\nan issue. As we will note at the end of this appendix, this difference in h\u03c6i leads directly to\ndifference in phenomenology. Thus, this is not just an academic issue.\nLet us first briefly review the relation between the field theory local models with branch\ncuts [9] and the description on the covering space [45]. We choose simplest case for illustrative\npurpose: a local geometry given by\ny 2 = x2 + (z 2 + 2uz + v + u2 )z N ,\n\n(129)\n\nwhere (u, v) are local coordinates of S. This local geometry can be modelled by a field theory\non a local region of S with SU(N + 2) gauge group [9], and it was claimed in [9] that the\nfield vev h\u03c6i = h\u03c6uv i du \u2227 dv should be chosen as\n\u221a\nh\u03c6uv i |2\u00d72 = diag(\u03c4+ , \u03c4\u2212 );\n\u03c4\u00b1 = \u2212u \u00b1 \u2212v.\n(130)\n\u03c4\u00b1 above corresponds to the two roots of (z 2 + 2uz + v + u2 ) = 0. The branch locus is v = 0.\nThe spectral surface is\n\u03be 2 + 2u\u03be + v + u2 = 0.\n(131)\nBecause the monodromy around the branch locus v = 0 is the Weyl reflection Z2 = S2\nof the SU(2) \u2282 SU(N + 2) structure group, one can describe the the same field theory in the\ne the field theory with branch locus above can be regarded as a Z2 orbifold\ncovering space S;\nof a theory on the covering space [45].49 Let the local coordinates of Se be (s, t), and the vev\nwas chosen in [45] as\nh\u03c6i |2\u00d72 = diag(s, t) ds \u2227 dt.\n(132)\nThis background has a Z2 symmetry transformation acting on Se as exchange of the coordinates s and t, accompanied by the Weyl-group transformation\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\ns\n1\ns\n1\n\u03c6st =\n\u2192\n.\n(133)\nt\n1\nt\n1\nThus, one can think of a quotient of the free SU(N + 2) gauge theory on Se under the Z2\nsymmetry transformation. To see the relation between the description on the covering space\ne\nSe and the quotient space S, it is convenient to take the following coordinates on S:\n1\nu = \u2212 (s + t),\n2\n\n1\n\u1e7d = (s \u2212 t).\n2\n\n49\n\n(134)\n\nIt is certainly a concern whether \"twisted sectors\" have to be introduced or not. Nothing is known about\nthis issue up until now, however.\n\n55\n\n\fThe Z2 transformation flips the sign of \u1e7d, while u remains invariant, and hence a point (u, \u1e7d)\nin Se is sent to (u, v) = (u, \u2212\u1e7d 2 ) in S under the Z2 quotient map. The filed vev (132) becomes\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u22121\nh\u03c6i |2\u00d72 = diag(\u03c4+ , \u03c4\u2212 ) 2du \u2227 d\u1e7d = diag(\u03c4+ , \u03c4\u2212 ) du \u2227 dv \u221a\n.\n(135)\n\u2212v\nThis \u03c6 vev configuration is almost the same as the one in (130), but differs by a factor v \u22121/2 .\nFor a given point (u, v) in S, the difference is the overall scaling between h/W \u2297 C-valued\n\u221a\ndiag(\u03c4+ , \u03c4\u2212 ) and diag(\u03c4+ , \u03c4\u2212 )/ \u2212v, which cannot be determined by the dictionary in [44].\nWe have discussed in the main text how to obtain the 2-form field vev h\u03c6i from the 4-form\n\u03a9 on the original Calabi\u2013Yau 4-fold. Discussion leading to (34, 36) revealed that (130) is the\nright choice. The deformation parameters of ADE singularities are regarded as sections of\nh/W \u2297 KS , and hence the deformation parameters should be identified with the coefficients\nof the holomorphic top form made out of the local coordinates of S, not with those of the\ne\ntop form made of the local coordinates of the covering space S.\nThe choice of the background configuration of \u03c6 is relevant to phenomenology, because it\ndetermines the asymptotic behavior of the zero mode wavefunctions away from the matter curves. If the background were (132), we knew that the zero mode wavefunctions\n2\n2\ne and they become a doublet wavefunction\nwould be e\u2212|s| and e\u2212|t| in the covering space S,\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2\n2\n(e\u2212|\u2212u+ \u2212v| , e\u2212|\u2212u\u2212 \u2212v| ) on the Z2 quotient S. In an asymptotic region where |u| remains\nsmall, but |v| becomes large, this zero mode wavefunction would decrease as e\u2212|v| , not as\n2\nfast as in the Gaussian profile e\u2212|v| . It turns out, however, that (130) is the right choice for\n3/2\nthe \u03c6 field background, and the wavefunction falls as e\u2212|v| in the asymptotic region, which\nis a little faster than the e\u2212|v| fall off, but still slower than in the Gaussian profile. As one\ncan see in the discussion around (103), how fast zero mode wavefunctions fall off in regions\naway from the matter curves is an important issue in phenomenology. Such a difference in\nthe wavefunction profile in the asymptotic region also affects the phenomenological analysis\nof flavor pattern in [3, 31] as well.\n\nReferences\n[1] R. Tatar and T.
