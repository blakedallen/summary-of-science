This possibility is a natural consequence of the hierarchical growth of structure predicted\nby the Lambda cold dark matter (\u039bCDM; a.k.a., \"Double\nDark\") cosmology (see, e.g., Somerville et al. 2001). In this\nscenario every dark matter halo, and presumably the galaxy\nit hosts, is assembled though a continuous and varied merger\nhistory comprised of many small accretion events and a few\n\"major\" ones (see, e.g., Lacey & Cole 1993; Wechsler et al.\n2002).\nThe transformation of galactic systems by major mergers has been well studied. Numerical simulations demonstrate that major mergers between spiral galaxies produce remnants that generally resemble elliptical galaxies,\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: tcox@cfa.harvard.edu\n\nc 0000 RAS\n\nwhose shapes are determined by random motions, i.e., they\nare pressure-supported, and which possess projected mass\ndistributions that scale approximately as \u223c r 1/4 (e.g.,\nBarnes & Hernquist 1991, 1992; Hernquist 1992, 1993b;\nNaab & Burkert 2003; Cox et al. 2006,?). Observations of\nfine structure, kinematic subsystems, the bimodal distributions of global clusters in elliptical galaxies, and the light\nprofiles of merger remnants lend support to the assertion\nthat elliptical galaxies are the byproduct of major galaxy\nmergers - in what is commonly termed the \"merger hypothesis\" (Toomre 1977). For further information regarding the observational and theoretical evidence supporting\nthe merger hypothesis, or the general dynamics of galaxy\ninteractions, we refer the interested reader to reviews by\nBarnes & Hernquist (1992), Schweizer (1998), and Struck\n(2006).\nWhile major mergers are likely to be the most dramatic\nevents in a galaxy's assembly history, it is likely that the\nmore prevalent minor mergers give rise to the wide variety of galaxy morphology that defines many classification\nsystems (Hubble 1926; de Vaucouleurs 1977; van den Bergh\n\n\f2\n\nCox et al.\n\n1960; Sandage 1975). The morphological transformation\nowing to the effects of minor merger has been studied\nvia numerous numerical simulations, which demonstrate\nthat galactic disks become warped and heated as a result of the accretion of a satellite (Quinn & Goodman\n1986; Toth & Ostriker 1992; Quinn et al. 1993; Walker et al.\n1996; Huang & Carlberg 1997; Velazquez & White 1999;\nFont et al. 2001), that the satellite itself is tidally stripped\nto produce stellar streams throughout the galactic halo\n(Johnston et al. 1999; Helmi & White 2001; Mayer et al.\n2002; Boylan-Kolchin & Ma 2007), and that the remnant galaxy will be a systematically earlier Hubble type\n(Aguerri et al. 2001; Naab & Burkert 2003; Bournaud et al.\n2004, 2005; Eliche-Moral et al. 2006; Maller et al. 2006).\nFurthermore, there is an increasing amount of evidence that these theoretical expectations are consistent\nwith observations in the local universe (e.g., Ibata et al.\n2001; Dalcanton & Bernstein 2002; Navarro et al. 2004;\nBullock & Johnston 2005).\nWhile both major and minor mergers are expected\nto produce some degree of morphological evolution, it is\nstill unclear whether all mergers will lead to a merger\u2013\ndriven starburst and therefore drive spectrophotometric evolution. There is mounting evidence that near equal mass\n(major) mergers trigger the most vigorous star-forming\ngalaxies in the local Universe, the ultraluminous infrared\ngalaxies (ULIRGs) with bolometric luminosities greater\n1012 L\u2299 (see, e.g., Sanders & Mirabel 1996; Borne et al.\n2000). More generally, large statistical samples consistently\nindicate a clear anticorrelation between projected galaxy\npair separation and star formation indicators in the optical\n(Barton et al. 2000; Nikolic et al. 2004; Lambas et al. 2003;\nSol Alonso et al. 2006; Barton et al. 2007; Ellison et al.\n2007) and the infrared (Geller et al. 2006; Smith et al.\n2007). Moreover, numerical simulations naturally explain\nthese observations as centrally concentrated starbursts triggered by tidal forces that attend the galaxy interaction (see,\ne.g., Barnes & Hernquist 1991; Mihos & Hernquist 1994b,\n1996; Springel 2000; Kapferer et al. 2005; Cox et al. 2006;\ndi Matteo et al. 2007).\nIn contrast, relatively little is known about the resulting starbursts during interactions between galaxies of\nunequal mass. Observationally, statistical studies are hampered by magnitude limits and confusion with background\nsources, but preliminarily indicate that enhanced star formation (as measured by H\u03b1) is strongly dependent upon\nthe relative mass (or magnitude) of the interacting galaxies. Initial results using the CfA2 Redshift Survey indicated\nno correlation between galaxy pair separation and equivalent width of H\u03b1 (Woods et al. 2006), suggesting that minor\nmergers do not lead to merger\u2013driven star formation. More\nrecent studies using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS,\nEllison et al. 2007; Woods & Geller 2007) find that minor\nmergers indeed lead to enhanced star formation, however\nthe data also suggest that the enhancement is primarily\nobserved in the satellite galaxy while the larger primary\ngalaxy has star forming properties similar to non\u2013interacting\nfield galaxies (Woods & Geller 2007). More locally, detailed observations of individual galaxies in the nearby Universe suggest that minor mergers may be responsible for\nsome degree of star formation enhancement, e.g., NGC\n278 (Knapen et al. 2004), NGC 3310 (Smith et al. 1996),\n\nNGC 4064 and NGC 4424 (Cort\u00e9s et al. 2006), NGC 7742\n(Mazzuca et al. 2006), and the M81 group (Walter et al.\n2002; F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. 2003).\nWhile numerical simulations have been used extensively\nin the study of star formation in major mergers, there exist\nonly a handful of previous simulations that have specifically\nquantified the star formation history of unequal mass galaxy\nmergers. These works have established that tidal perturbations can induce bar formation, inflows of gas, and subsequent bursts of star formation when the primary disks are\nsusceptible to instabilities, such as when they do not contain\na stellar bulge (Hernquist 1989; Mihos & Hernquist 1994a;\nHernquist & Mihos 1995). However, because these studies\nperformed only a limited number of simulations, and did not\ninclude some important physical processes, our understanding of the relationship between mergers of unequal mass\ngalaxies and the resulting star formation is still highly incomplete.\nIn this paper we fill in this gap by describing a large set\nof numerical simulations of unequal mass disk-galaxy mergers. In particular, we seek to extend and improve the pioneering work of Mihos & Hernquist (1994a) and provide a more\ncomplete picture of merger\u2013driven star formation, including\nits dependence upon the merging orbit and the structure\nof the primary galaxy. We will also take advantage of recent improvements in the treatment of supernovae feedback\n(Springel 2000; Springel & Hernquist 2003; Cox et al. 2006)\nand smoothed\u2013particle hydrodynamics (SPH) methodology\n(Springel & Hernquist 2002) which allow us to follow the\nevolution of galaxies with larger gas fraction than was possible previously.\nThe results of our simulations are relevant for a number of related studies. Many models of galaxy formation often employ merger\u2013driven star formation as a necessary ingredient to produce bright galaxies throughout cosmic time\n(Guiderdoni et al. 1998; Somerville et al. 2001; Baugh et al.\n2005). Our results will serve as a useful input to such models.\nIn addition, our models will be a valuable tool for interpreting observations. By comparison to the observed star formation in pairs of galaxies (Barton et al. 2000; Woods et al.\n2006; Woods & Geller 2007; Lin et al. 2007), we can constrain our models and infer the contribution of mergers\nto the universal star formation rate. The numerical models have also been used to generate \"simulated observations\" of the merging galaxies through radiative transfer\nmodeling (Jonsson 2004; Jonsson et al. 2006; Jonsson 2006),\nto study dust attenuation in spiral galaxies (Rocha et al.\n2007), to understand the size, shape, and scaling relations\nof merger remnants (Dekel & Cox 2006; Novak et al. 2006;\nCovington et al. 2007), and to calibrate non-parametric indicators of galaxy morphology (Lotz et al., in preparation),\nwhich can then be used to quantify the merger rate over\ncosmic time.\nWe organize this paper as follows: Our numerical techniques are summarized in \u00a72 and the galaxy models used\nfor our galaxy interactions are described in \u00a73. A general\ndescription of the mergers is provided in \u00a74, including a discussion about the possible methods to quantify the mergerdriven star formation. Some additional models are explored\nin \u00a75. Finally, we discuss our results and conclude in \u00a76.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fThe effect of galaxy mass ratio on merger\u2013driven starbursts\n2\n\nNUMERICAL SIMULATIONS\n\nAll of the numerical simulations performed in this work\nuse the N-Body/SPH code GADGET (Springel et al. 2001).\nIn general, our methodology is similar to Cox (2004) and\nCox et al. (2006), and thus, in this section we will only review selected aspects of our techniques and methodology\nthat are relevant to this work. We use the first version of\nGADGET, however the smoothed particle hydrodynamics\n(SPH) modules are upgraded (with the aid of V. Springel)\nto use the \"conservative entropy\" version that is detailed\nin Springel & Hernquist (2002). The radiative cooling rate\n\u039bnet (\u03c1, u) is computed for a primordial plasma as described\nin Katz et al. (1996). Stars are formed at a rate determined\nby the local SPH density normalized to match observed star\nformation rates (Kennicutt 1998). Furthermore, we employ\na threshold density \u03c1th , below which stars do not form. Finally, star formation occurs within individual SPH particles\nand each particle can stochastically spawn two stellar particles.\nOne of the largest uncertainties associated with current\nnumerical simulations including star formation is the implementation of supernova feedback. Because of the limited\nresolution achievable in state-of-the-art numerical simulations, most work performed to date adopts a \"sub\u2013grid\"\napproach where the physical processes associated with feedback are included in a simple, yet flexible manner with free\nparameters that can be tuned to match observations. Unfortunately, there are often a range of acceptable free parameters which produce distinct star formation histories or remnant morphologies (see, e.g., Thacker & Couchman 2000;\nKay et al. 2002; Springel et al. 2005b; Cox et al. 2006). For\nmany of the simulations performed in this work, we have run\ntwo different feedback models, either the n0med or n2med\nmodels as introduced in Cox et al. (2006). Both models are\ntermed \"medium\" because they dissipate feedback energy\non a 8 Myr timescale. The n2med model treats star-forming\ngas with a stiff equation of state while n0med assumes this\ngas is isothermal with an effective temperature \u223c 105 K. We\nwill compare these two feedback models in \u00a74.3.2 in order\nto determine how these assumptions influence the resulting\nstar-formation history.\nAll simulations presented throughout this work use a\ngravitational softening length of 0.1 kpc for all baryonic\nparticles, and 0.4 kpc for dark matter particles. The SPH\nsmoothing length is required to be greater than half the\ngravitational softening length, or > 50 pc. We have performed a few tests with both smaller and larger softening lengths and found little or no differences in the starformation history, suggesting that we have achieved numerical convergence (see Cox et al. 2006, for similar tests).\n\n3\n\nGALAXY MODELS\n\nBecause our primary motivation is to investigate collisions\nbetween unequal mass galaxies, we wish to construct galaxies with a range of different masses. Furthermore, because\nthe properties of galactic disks depend on mass, we also\nneed to design galaxy models that are physically plausible.\nTo begin, we select the largest galaxy model to have a total\nstellar mass of M\u22c6 \u223c 5.0\u00d71010 M\u2299 , slightly above the transitional mass of 3.0\u00d71010 M\u2299 found to divide large galaxies\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n3\n\nwith old stellar populations from smaller star forming ones\n(Kauffmann et al. 2003). Three smaller galaxy models are\nincluded that have M\u22c6 equal to 1.5 \u00d71010 M\u2299 , 0.5 \u00d71010\nM\u2299 and 0.1 \u00d71010 M\u2299 , making the total stellar mass span\na range of 50. We label the largest of these models G3, and\nthe rest G2, G1, and, finally, the smallest G0.\nOnce the stellar masses are fixed, we next determine\nthe stellar size using the late-type galaxy size-mass relationship found by Shen et al. (2003, eq. 18), from the analysis\nof 140,000 galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. This relation fixes the half-light radius R50 for each model, which\nwe assume is equivalent to the stellar half-mass radius.\nBecause each model is assumed to be a late-type galaxy,\nthey consist of a stellar and gaseous exponential disk, a stellar Hernquist (1990) bulge, all embedded in a dark matter\nhalo. A general description of the methods employed to construct model disk galaxies, including the assumed profiles,\ncan be found in Cox et al. (2006), however, those models\nare not identical to the ones used here. The model parameters used for this work, which are listed in Table 1, are selected such that each model galaxy is statistically average,\nas opposed to Cox et al. (2006) who specifically modeled a\ngas\u2013rich Sbc galaxy.\nTo ensure that the models are statistically average, the\nmass of the stellar disk and bulge are constrained by the\nhalf-mass radius R50 and the observed bulge-to-disk ratio\nof local late-type galaxies (de Jong 1996). To quantify the\nlatter constraint, we assume a K-band mass-to-light ratio of\n0.7 and 0.5 for the bulge and disk, respectively, and fit a line\nto the de Jong (1996) data, finding\nlog(Mbulge ) = 1.6 log(Mdisk ) \u2212 1.03,\n\n(1)\n\n10\n\nwhere the masses are in units of 10 M\u2299 . Using this formula,\nalong with the fixed total stellar mass for each model, both\nthe stellar bulge and stellar disk masses are determined. To\ndetermine the size of these components (the exponential disk\nscale radius Rd and the bulge scale radius Rb ) an iterative\napproach is used where the first step is to guess an initial\ndisk scale radius Rd . The bulge scale radius Rb is then fixed\nby the empirical correlation between disk and bulge sizes\nfound by de Jong (1996, see his Eq. 5). This initial guess for\nthe disk and bulge mass distributions is then compared to\nthe desired half-mass radius R50 and corrected until the two\nare within 1% of each other.\nIn addition to the stellar component, each galaxy\nmodel contains gas, the fuel for star formation. Motivated by observations of local late-type galaxies (e.g.,\nBroeils & van Woerden 1994), gas is distributed in an extended exponential disk with a scale radius proportional to\nthat of the stellar disk, rgas = \u03b1rstar . In our default model we\nassume \u03b1 = 3. To determine the mass of gas, we use the observed trend that systems with lower total/stellar mass have\na higher gas fraction (Bell et al. 2003; Geha et al. 2006). Using data from Bell et al. (2003, kindly provided in electronic\nform by E. Bell), we parameterize this relationship as\nlog(Mgas ) = 0.78 log(M\u22c6 ) + 1.74,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere both masses are in units of 1010 M\u2299 . Because this relation is derived from the mean gas content as a function of\ntotal baryonic mass, the model disks will contain only moderate quantities of gas, and are therefore unlikely to produce\nlarge bursts of star formation. In \u00a75.4 we will perform a small\n\n\f4\n\nCox et al.\n\nTable 1. Properties of galaxy models used in this study. The compound galaxy has a total mass Mvir , and is composed of dark matter\nand a stellar disk, stellar bulge, and gaseous disk. The total mass of each baryonic component and their mass fractions are provided. The\ndark halo has an NFW profile with concentration c and spin parameter \u03bb. The stellar disk has a total mass Mdisk which is a fraction\nmd of the total mass and a fraction jd of the total angular momentum. The disk has an exponential profile of scale radius Rd and scale\nheight z0 . Each galaxy model contains a spherical bulge of mass Mbulge and mass fraction mb , with an exponential profile of scale length\nRb and zero angular momentum. The gas mass is Mgas , a fraction mg of the total mass, and jg is the angular momentum fraction. The\ngas disk, like its stellar companion, is assumed to have an exponential surface density with a scale radius \u03b1 times Rd . We define the gas\nfraction f as the fraction of the total disk mass which is gaseous. Finally, each system is represented by N particles, which represent the\ndark matter, stellar disk, bulge and gaseous galaxy.\nG3\n\nG2\n\nG1\n\nG0\n\nM\u22c6 (1010 M\u2299 )\nR50 (kpc)\n\n5.0\n3.86\n\n1.5\n2.88\n\n0.5\n2.35\n\n0.1\n1.83\n\nTotal Mass, Mvir (1010 M\u2299 )\nConcentration, c=Rvir /rs\nSpin Parameter, \u03bb\n\n116.0\n6\n0.05\n\n51.0\n9\n0.05\n\n20.0\n12\n0.05\n\n5.0\n14\n0.05\n\nMass, Mdisk (1010 M\u2299 )\nMass Fraction, md\nScale Length, Rd (kpc)\nScale Height, z0 (kpc)\nSpin Fraction, jd\n\n4.11\n0.035\n2.85\n0.40\n0.015\n\n1.35\n0.026\n1.91\n0.38\n0.010\n\n0.47\n0.024\n1.48\n0.30\n0.010\n\n0.098\n0.019\n1.12\n0.22\n0.010\n\n8.9\n0.22\n0.008\n0.37\n\n1.5\n0.11\n0.003\n0.26\n\n0.3\n0.06\n0.002\n0.20\n\n0.02\n0.02\n<0.001\n0.15\n\n1.22\n0.011\n0.196\n3.0\n0.012\n\n0.48\n0.009\n0.242\n3.0\n0.010\n\n0.20\n0.010\n0.286\n3.0\n0.013\n\n0.06\n0.012\n0.375\n3.0\n0.019\n\n240,000\n120,000\n50,000\n50,000\n10,000\n\n150,000\n80,000\n30,000\n30,000\n10,000\n\n95,000\n50,000\n20,000\n20,000\n5,000\n\n51,000\n30,000\n10,000\n10,000\n1,000\n\nDisk\nDisk\nDisk\nDisk\nDisk\n\nBulge Mass, Mbulge (109 M\u2299 )\nBulge-to-disk ratio, B/D\nBulge Mass Fraction, mb\nBulge Radial Scale Length, Rb (kpc)\nGas\nGas\nGas\nGas\nGas\n\nMass, Mgas (1010 M\u2299 )\nMass Fraction, mg\nFraction, f\nScale Multiplier, \u03b1\nSpin Fraction, jg\n\nN\nNdm\nNgas\nNdisk\nNbulge\n\nnumber of additional mergers using galaxies with higher gas\nfractions.\nThe final component of the galactic system is the massive dark-matter halo. Each model contains a dark halo\nwith a Navarro et al. (1996, NFW) profile whose properties\nare selected so that the rotation curve satisfies the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (Bell & de Jong 2001; Bell et al.\n2003). Because most of the models require very little nonbaryonic mass in order to satisfy the Tully-Fisher relation,\nwe do not include adiabatic contraction. Still, the resultant\nhalo concentrations c are below the mean found in cosmological N-body simulations (Bullock et al. 2001), a tension\nthat has been emphasized previously (see, e.g., Alam et al.\n2002). We note that (motivated by observations) the galaxy\nmodels have systematically higher baryon fractions in higher\nmass galaxies, resulting in a total mass ratio 23 between G3\nand G0 as opposed to a ratio of 50 in stellar mass.\nThe construction of these galaxy models is based upon\nHernquist (1993a) and its more recent incarnation to include a NFW halo (Springel & White 1999; Springel 2000).\nWe note that because the spatial distribution of baryons is\nfixed by the galaxy model, the halo spin does not determine\nthe size of the gaseous and stellar disk, as in many popular\n\nmodels for disk formation (see, e.g., Mo et al. 1998). However, we feel that our procedure is adequate since it produces stable disks, provided that the velocity dispersion of\nthe disks is chosen such that the Toomre stability parameter\nQ is greater than 1 at all radii and the feedback model can\nprovide adequate pressure support to the gas.\n\n3.1\n\nEvolution of Isolated Systems\n\nThe stability of our model galaxies is demonstrated in Figure 1, which shows the projected gas and stellar surface densities after being evolved in isolation for \u223c 1 Gyr (greater\nthan 5 orbital periods in all models). While the mass distributions of each component are stable during the entire\nperiod that they are simulated, the noisy potential resulting\nfrom the finite particle number seeds transient instabilities\n(see Hernquist 1993a). These instabilities are most prominent in the G3 and G2 galaxies, which have larger disk surface densities than the less massive galaxy models.\nThe stability of the galaxy models is also reflected by a\nconstant star-formation rate (SFR), regardless of the feedback model employed, as shown in Figure 2. The average\nSFR is 0.95, 0.25, 0.06 and 0.001 M\u2299 yr\u22121 for models G3,\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fThe effect of galaxy mass ratio on merger\u2013driven starbursts\n\n5\n\nFigure 1. Projected mass density for each galaxy model, G0 (left column), G1, G2, and G3 (right column) when simulated in isolation\nfor \u223c 1 Gyr, which is greater than 5 orbital periods at the half\u2013mass radius in all models. Each row shows the projected stellar or\ngaseous mass as specified in the lower-left of each panel. The top two rows show the galaxies face\u2013on, while the bottom two rows show\nthe edge\u2013on view. Each panel measures 80 kpc on a side. A color bar in the upper\u2013left panel indicates the stellar surface density scale\nthat is used for all panels, and the color bar in the one below indicates the gaseous surface density scale that is used in all panels.\n\nG2, G1, and G0, respectively, during the 1 Gyr period shown\n3/2\nin Figure 2. The average SFR scales as Mgas , as is expected\nfrom our Schmidt-type star-formation law (see Cox et al.\n2006). The SFR of the smaller galaxies, G1 and G0, display increased fluctuations owing to the more significant impact of feedback, decreasing resolution, and the fixed starformation threshold density \u03c1th . The SFRs shown in Figure 2 are constant for \u223c 2 Gyr. After this, galaxies G3 and\nG2 begin to consume a significant fraction of their highdensity (> \u03c1th ) gas and their SFR eventually drops to approximately one\u2013tenth its initial value at 6 Gyr. Another\nconsequence of the adopted star-formation law is that the\nstar-formation timescale scales with gas density, viz., \u03c4SF \u2248\nMgas /SFR \u223c \u03c1\u22121/2 , in other words, more massive galaxies, with higher gas densities, have shorter gas consumption timescales. As a result, the more massive galaxy models\nconsume a larger fraction of their initial gas mass than the\nsmaller ones. During the entire 6 Gyr evolution, model G3\nconverts 26% of its original gas to stars, G2 converts 22%,\nG1 converts 11%, and G0 converts 3%.\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n4\n\nGALAXY MERGERS\n\nThe previous section defined four galaxy models G3-G0 and\nestablished the stability of these models by simulating them\nin isolation. In this section we discuss the outcome of binary\nmergers between these models on a single merging orbit.\nPerforming a single merger between all combinations of the\nfour models yields four equal-mass major mergers and six\nunequal\u2013mass mergers. In the following section (\u00a75), we discuss a number of additional merger simulations to determine\nsystematic dependencies.\n\n4.1\n\nFiducial Encounters\n\nFor reference, we list the merger mass ratios in Table 2. Mass\nratios are given for the total, stellar and baryonic masses.\nIn what follows we will label a simulated mergers by its\ntwo merging constituents. For example, G3G1 is a merger\nbetween our largest galaxy G3 and the second\u2013smallest G1.\nThe total mass ratio is 5.8 to 1, i.e., model G1 is 5.8 times\nsmaller than G3. When referring to the interacting galaxies,\nthe less massive galaxy will be termed the satellite and the\nmore massive galaxy the primary. We note that some galaxy\n\n\f6\n\nCox et al.\nthe other, more rapid, mergers, we multiplied the initial velocity of the satellite by 0.2 so that the merger occurred\nduring the 6 Gyrs we followed each interaction.\nFinally, the fiducial series of orbits are all prograde, i.e.,\nthe angular momentum of the orbit is (nearly) aligned with\nthe spin of the primary. A slight tilt of 30\u25e6 is introduced such\nthat the interaction is not entirely co-planar. In section 5.1\nwe resimulate the G3G2 and G3G1 mergers with a variety\nof orbits to determine the dependence of merger\u2013driven star\nformation on orbital angular momentum (Rperi ) and merger\nalignment.\n4.2\n\nFigure 2.

The initial\nseparation is fixed to be slightly less than the virial radius\nof the primary and is 250, 100, 80, and 50 kpc for G3, G2,\nG1, and G0 models, respectively. The pericentric distance is\nset to be 13.6, 3.8, 2.96, and 2.24 when the primary is G3,\nG2, G1, and G0, respectively. The resulting interactions are\nfast and nearly radial, consistent with orbits found for dark\nmatter halos in cosmological simulations (Vitvitska et al.\n2002; Khochfar & Burkert 2006; Benson 2005; Zentner et al.\n2005). The only exception to the above orbits is the merger\nG3G0, where the total mass ratio is 22.7 to 1, the largest\nmass ratio we simulate. In this case, the fiducial interaction\nwas still not fully merged after the system was evolved for\n\u223c 12 Gyr. In order to better compare this interaction with\n\nMerger Evolution\n\nThe evolution of a typical merger event is shown in Figures 3 and 4 for the G3G2 merger, and Figures 5 and 6 for\nthe G3G1 merger. In both cases, the projected stellar surface\ndensity is first shown, followed by the projected gaseous surface density. The images shown in these figures are typical of\nthe remaining mergers that are not shown, and are also consistent with what has been discussed in studies of equal mass\nmergers (e.g., Barnes & Hernquist 1991; Mihos & Hernquist\n1996; Springel 2000; Cox et al. 2006), and unequal mass\nmergers (e.g., Hernquist 1989; Hernquist & Mihos 1995).\nFor completeness, the following provides a brief outline of\nthe merger process, and the resulting star formation.\nIn both of the mergers shown the satellite galaxy (G2\nand G1) first makes a fast, direct approach toward the primary galaxy (G3). This close passage tidally distorts the\ndisks and generates symmetric tails in both. Owing to the\nenergetic orbit, the satellite separates again for several orbital periods (>1 Gyr) before returning for its second encounter with the disk of the primary. A generic feature of all\nthe interactions simulated here is the efficient loss of angular momentum by the satellite. In particular, even for large\nmass ratio encounters the orbits become almost entirely radial after the first or second close passage.\nThe loss of orbital angular momentum and eventual radial nature of the final merger limits the coupling between\norbital and spin angular momentum, and therefore the tidal\nresponse. Most of the induced star formation during the final coalescence is a result of the collisional nature of the gas\nand the rapid fluctuations in the potential as the satellite\noscillates through the center and the system finally relaxes.\nThe collisional nature of the gas also produces several other\nfeatures distinct from the stellar disk. During the first close\npassage, the satellite creates a snow\u2013plow effect, as it clears\nout gas from the primary's extended gas disk. This effect\ncontinues during each close passage until eventually the majority of the gas in the satellite has been stripped off, leaving\na predominantly stellar satellite. However, by this point the\norbit has decreased such that it is difficult to disentangle the\ntwo galaxies.\nWhile it is beyond the scope of the current paper to\nprovide a detailed analysis of the structure of the merger\nremnants, there are several qualitative features present in\nFigures 3\u20136 that motivate future inquiry. First, it is evident\nthat the stellar disks have been thickened and dynamically\nheated during the accretion event, consistent with a number of previous numerical studies (e.g., Quinn & Goodman\n1986; Quinn et al. 1993; Toth & Ostriker 1992; Walker et al.\n1996; Velazquez & White 1999; Benson et al. 2004;\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fThe effect of galaxy mass ratio on merger\u2013driven starbursts\n\n7\n\nFigure 3. Projected stellar mass density during the G3G2 merger simulation as viewed in the orbital plane. Each panel measures 200 kpc\non a side and the time, in Gyr, is displayed in the upper left of each panel. The orbit of the satellite galaxy G2 is denoted by a dotted\nline until it has completely merged with the primary galaxy. The bottom\u2013right panel shows a side view of the final merger remnant, and\nclearly indicates the initial 30\u25e6 inclination of the progenitor disk. The top\u2013left panel indicates the color scale used in all panels.\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\f8\n\nCox et al.\n\nFigure 4.

The side views demonstrate\nthat the G3G2 interaction has had a more disruptive effect\non the primary's stellar and gaseous disk than the G3G1\ninteraction, an unsurprising result given the smaller mass\nratio and hence larger tidal disturbance. Furthermore, the\ngaseous disks are also affected. It is particularly interesting\nthat the G3G1 remnant contains a relatively large, thin\ngaseous disk, indicating that during an unequal mass\ninteraction the gaseous disk can dissipate its energy and\nmaintain its structure while the stellar disk cannot. The\nsecond qualitatively interesting feature is the efficient\ndeposition of the satellite galaxy in the center of the merger\nremnant. Such a process may be a prominent mechanism\nto build galactic bulges (see also Aguerri et al. 2001;\nEliche-Moral et al. 2006).\n4.3\n\nStar Formation\n\nThe star formation history for all of our fiducial galaxy mergers is displayed in Figure 7. There are four plots in this\nfigure, one for each of the four primary galaxy models. The\nupper\u2013left panel shows the star\u2013formation rate (SFR) for all\ninteractions that involve the most massive galaxy G3. The\nremaining panels show all the remaining mergers, grouped\nby the largest participant galaxy. Thus each panels shows\nthe SFR for one major merger and one or more minor mergers, except for the G0 panel which only has the G0G0 major\nmerger.\nThe SFRs shown in Figure 7 are clearly enhanced compared to the quiescent SFRs shown in Figure 2. For example, the maximum SFR during the G3G3 interaction\n(\u223c 26 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ) is 13 times larger than the summed SFR\nof two isolated G3 disks (\u223c 1 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ), the maximum SFR\nduring the G3G2 interaction (\u223c 27 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ) is 21 times\nlarger than an isolated G3 (\u223c 1 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ) plus an isolated\nG2 (\u223c 0.25 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ), and the maximum SFR during the\nG0G0 interaction (\u223c 3.8 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ) is 3800 times larger than\ntwo isolated G0 disks (\u223c 10\u22123 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ), however \u00a74.3.2\ndemonstrates that these factors depend upon the feedback\nmodel.\nIn \u00a74.4 we will quantify the relationship between the\nmass ratio of the interacting galaxies and the enhanced star\nformation in more detail, but we note that this trend fits naturally within a merger\u2013driven scenario for star formation. In\nparticular, during an interaction gas is stripped of its angular momentum by bar-like structures during the early stages\nof the merger or the abundant collisions and a growing potential well during the messy coalescence. In both cases the\nresulting central concentration of gas fuels a burst of star\nformation. Since the tidal forces associated with the merger\ngenerate these effects, their magnitude is expected to scale\nwith the size of the perturbation. While this general picture has been studied in great detail for collisions between\nequal mass galaxies (e.g., Mihos & Hernquist 1994a, 1996;\nSpringel 2000; Cox et al. 2006), we demonstrate here that\nthe star formation clearly depends on the mass ratio of the\ninteracting galaxies.\nWe caution that the global SFR, as is shown in Figure 7, will be dominated by the largest galaxy when the\ninteracting galaxy mass ratio is large, as in the G3G1 and\nG3G0 mergers. In this case, the small enhancement in the\nSFR is only an indication that the primary, G3, is not tidally\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nFigure 8. Star\u2013formation rate during G3G1 interaction including\nthe contributions from participant galaxies G3 and G1 separately.\n\ndisturbed enough to induce radial inflows of gas and additional star formation. The less massive satellite, however,\nis expected to experience significant tidal forces and may\nhave a large enhancement of star formation that is hidden\nwithin the global rate. Such is the case for G3G1, as shown\nin Figure 8, where the global SFR is shown as well as the\ncontributions from both the primary and the satellite. While\nG3, the larger galaxy, constitutes the majority of the overall\nstar formation, its rate is largely unchanged from the initial\nstages and eventually decays as a result of gas depletion.\nThere is a small enhancement of star formation above the\nquiescent G3 from T \u2248 3 \u2212 5 Gyr coincident with the final\ncoalescence. In contrast, the satellite galaxy G1 experiences\nseveral bursts of star formation that are > 3 times its quiescent rate, consistent with merger\u2013driven star formation.\nThe exact relationship between merger mass ratio and\nenhanced star formation is complicated by the fact that the\nstar formation history also depends upon the nature of the\ninteraction, the structure of the participating galaxies, and\nthe \"sub\u2013grid\" model for star formation and feedback. The\nfirst two dependencies are inherently physical assumptions\nand will be investigated further in \u00a75. The last dependency,\nhowever, is determined by numerical free parameters that\nare not well constrained. In \u00a74.3.2 this issue will be considered further, with the specific goal of determining which\nfeatures of the star\u2013formation history provide a measure of\nthe merger\u2013driven star formation that are insensitive to assumptions about the feedback model.\n4.3.1\n\nLocation of Starburst\n\nOne result of merger\u2013driven star formation is a concentration of newly formed stars in the galactic center.

The line thickness\nincreases with decreasing mass ratio, e.g., the thickest line in each panel is the 1:1 major merger, while the thinnest line is the large mass\nratio minor merger. Note that the vertical axis changes from panel to panel, based upon the maximum star formation rate for the major\nmerger. All runs shown here used the n0med feedback model.\n\ndemonstrates that this is a generic outcome of our interactions by showing the surface mass density of \"new stars,\"\ni.e., stars that form during the interaction, for the remnants\nof the G3Gx set of interactions. Numerous numerical simulations have previously found similar profiles (though often\nplotted versus r 1/4 ) for remnants of major mergers (e.g.,\nMihos & Hernquist 1996; Springel 2000; Cox et al. 2006).\nThe central concentrations of new stars are often disjoint\nfrom the outer, old\u2013star profiles, in apparent conflict with\nthe r 1/4 profile that most ellipticals are assumed to have.\nWhile this was once considered a problem for the merger\nhypothesis, recent high\u2013resolution observations now indicate that such features exist in nearly all merger remnants\n\n(Rothberg & Joseph 2004) and many low\u2013luminosity elliptical galaxies (Kormendy et al. 2007).\nBecause the gaseous inflows that produce these central concentrations of new stars are produced by the gravitational forces arising from the interaction, we expect the\namount of new stellar mass in the galactic center to correlate\nwith the merger mass ratio. Indeed, Figure 9 demonstrates\nthat the new star profile within \u223c 4 kpc becomes monotonically steeper with decreasing merger mass ratio. The least\ndisruptive mergers, G3G1 and G3G0, have profiles that are\nessentially exponential beyond \u223c 1 kpc, while the smaller\nmass ratio mergers G3G3 and G3G2 have profiles that are\nbetter fit by r 1/4 \u2013type distributions.\nAnother way to characterize the distribution of star forc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fThe effect of galaxy mass ratio on merger\u2013driven starbursts\n\nFigure 9. Mass surface density of \"new stars,\" i.e., stars that are\nforming during the interaction, for mergers G3G3, G3G2, G3G1,\nand G3G0.\n\nmation as a result of the interaction is by simply quantifying\nthe fraction of gas that is driven to within the central several hundred pc of the primary. This quantity was an especially relevant measure of the potential starburst event when\nnumerical simulations did not include star formation (e.g.,\nHernquist 1989; Hernquist & Mihos 1995). In these works it\nwas always found that > 35% of the gas in the primary was\ndriven to within the central several hundred pc. The only\nexception was when Hernquist & Mihos (1995) adopted a\nmodel in which the interstellar medium was isothermal with\na temperature > 3 \u00d7 105 K. We note that we always find\nthat < 35% of the gas in the primary is driven to within\n500 pc, even during the G3G3 major merger. For the large\nmass ratio mergers this percentage is closer to 10%, which\nis similar to the G3 galaxy evolved in isolation. This trend\ntoward smaller inflows of gas is another manifestation of the\ndifferences between our modeling and what was performed\npreviously (see more extensive discussion in \u00a76.1).\nWhile it is beyond the scope of the present work, analysis of the remnant profiles uncovers two interesting avenues\nfor future study. First, it is intriguing that the new\u2013star\nprofiles of the remnants of very large mass-ratio mergers are\nwell fitted by a bulge plus exponential disk profile, suggesting that such minor mergers may be an efficient mechanism\nfor growing galactic bulges. Second, at large (\u223c 10 kpc) radii\nthe profiles of the large mass ratio remnants differ from the\nG3 evolved in isolation owing to induced star formation and\nangular momentum transfer during the early stages of the\ninteraction (see also Younger et al. 2007).\n\n4.3.2\n\nDependence on Star Formation and Feedback\nParameters\n\nAs mentioned previously (\u00a72 and \u00a74.3), and shown explicitly by Cox et al. (2006) using numerical simulations of major mergers, the star-formation history during an interacc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n13\n\nFigure 11. Comparison of the gas consumption during equivalent\nsimulations performed with two different parameterizations for\nfeedback, n0med and n2med. The label for the merger simulations\nare grouped by the primary. The isolated galaxies are identical to\nthe simulations presented in Figures 1 and 2.\n\ntion depends upon the adopted feedback model. This is in\ncontrast to the star\u2013formation history of an isolated spiral,\nwhich, as shown in Figure 2 (and in Cox et al. 2006), is\nindependent of the feedback model. As a result, it is unclear\nwhat measure of the star\u2013formation history will provide a\nrobust characterization of the merger\u2013driven star formation.\nTo investigate this further, we resimulated our fiducial set of\nmergers using the n2med feedback model in addition to the\nn0med that was presented in \u00a74.3. As shown in Cox et al.\n(2006), the \"medium\" feedback models are slightly favored\nbecause they can maintain a stable gas disk in an isolated\ngas\u2013rich Sbc galaxy model and also produce merger\u2013driven\nstarbursts. The n0med model treats star\u2013forming gas with\nan isothermal (\u223c 105 K) equation of state while the n2med\nhas a stiff equation of state that restricts the quantity of gas\nat very high densities.\nFigure 10 shows the SFR and gas consumption during\nthe G3G2, G3G1, and G3G0 unequal mass mergers for both\nthe n0med and n2med feedback models. For all interactions\nthe peak of star formation begins sooner, has a much larger\nmaximum, and a shorter duration in the n0med feedback\nmodel as opposed to n2med. However, regardless of the differences in the star-formation history, the gas consumption\nis very similar, as shown for the full series of merger simulations in Figure 11. This result motivates us to focus our\nanalysis upon quantities that use the gas consumption rather\nthan details of the time\u2013dependent star-formation history,\nsince the gas consumption is invariant to assumptions about\nthe feedback model. We also note that the non\u2013equivalence\nin gas consumption between the two feedback models that is\npresent in Figure 11 can be used to estimate our errors owing to adopting a single feedback model. From the standard\ndeviation in discrepancies we estimate an error of \u223c 0.04 in\nthe gas consumption owing to the choice of feedback model.\n\n\f14\n\nCox et al.\n\nFigure 10. Comparison between two parameterization of star formation and feedback in identical unequal mass mergers. The top panels\nshow the star-formation rate, and the bottom panels show the gas consumption. In general, details of the star-formation history depend\non the feedback model while the gas consumption remains relatively invariant. The burst efficiency (see \u00a74.4.1) of each run (n2med on\ntop, and n0med on the bottom) is provided in the lower panel.\n\nHowever, we also caution that 3 out of the 4 major mergers\nhave slightly (< 0.1) higher gas consumption when adopting\nthe n0med feedback model, and the 2 minor mergers with\nthe largest mass ratios have higher gas consumption when\nadopting the n2med feedback model. Therefore, it is possible\nthat subtle, yet systematic, trends exist between alternate\nfeedback models.\nAs a final comment we note that Figure 10 demonstrates that the feedback model can drastically affect the\ntime\u2013dependent star\u2013formation rate, and therefore the luminosity of the system, even though the total gas consumption is similar. The varying luminosity evolution admits the\npossibility to better constrain the feedback model through\na comparison to the observed distribution of star\u2013formation\nrates (see, e.g., Noeske & al. 2007).\n\n4.3.3\n\nThe Star\u2013Formation Timescale\n\nThe previous section demonstrates that each feedback\nmodel yields a unique star formation history, and noted\nthat one difference between the histories is the star\u2013\nformation timescale. Because differences in the star\u2013\nformation timescale directly affect the predicted color, line\u2013\nstrength, and nuclear activity of the interacting pair, future work may have the ability to discriminate between\nfeedback models based upon comparisons with observations\n(e.g., Barton et al. 2000; Nikolic et al. 2004; Woods et al.\n2006; Geller et al. 2006; Woods & Geller 2007; Ellison et al.\n2007; Barton et al. 2007).\nAs a preliminary step toward this goal, we quantify\nthe starburst timescale for the mergers simulated here from\nthree different fits to the starburst events. The first fit is\nmotivated by the intrinsic shape of the starburst events as\n\nFigure 12. Star\u2013formation rate during the G3G3 major merger\nwith the n0med feedback parameters (thick solid line). Overplotted are three characterizations of the merger timescale, one, a\nsingle Gaussian fit to the merger\u2013induced peak of star formation (thin solid line), two, a decaying exponential fit to the star\u2013\nformation rate after the peak of star formation and, three, the\nfull width at half maximum (vertical dashed lines).\n\nexemplified in Figures 7 and 10, namely they appear Gaussian in shape and their timescale can be characterized by\nthe width \u03c3. The second fit is motivated by many models\nof galaxy evolution that describe star formation as a decayc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fThe effect of galaxy mass ratio on merger\u2013driven starbursts\n\n15\n\n0.47FWHM, i.e., the estimates from the different fits are\nall scaled to be in terms of the exponential decay timescale\n\u03c4 . This also provides a simple estimate of the error in our\nfitting procedure from the dispersion among the three determinations of the timescale.\nIn Figure 13 we plot the estimates for the star formation\ntimescale and the associated errors for the fiducial set of runs\nas a function of merger mass ratio for both feedback models.\nTo characterize the mass\u2013ratio dependence, we have fit a\nsimple power\u2013law to the mergers of each feedback model,\nviz.,\n\u201e\n\u00ab\u03b1\nMsat\n\u03c4SF = \u03c40\n.\n(3)\nMprimary\n\nFigure 13. The star formation timescale (\u03c4SF ) as a function of\nmerger mass ratio for our fiducial series of mergers when simulated with both the n0med and n2med feedback models. The\ntimescale is the average of the three fits (Gaussian, exponential,\nand FWHM) scaled to the exponential decay timescale \u03c4 and\nthe errors are estimated by the dispersion between the three fit\nparameters. The solid lines are fits to the simulated data using\nEquation 3.\n\ning exponential with a timescale \u03c4 , and are therefore often\ndescribed as \"tau\"-models (see, e.g., Somerville & Primack\n1999; Harker et al. 2006; Noeske & al. 2007). The last\nmethod to describe the star formation timescale calculates\nthe full width at half maximum (FWHM) and therefore\navoids any biases associated with adopting a specified distribution for of the starburst. Another possibility, which we\nreserve for future work, is to compile the full luminosity distribution for the entire merger as has been done previously\nby Jonsson (2004) and Hopkins et al. (2006).\nAs an example of a starburst event, and its corresponding fits, we show the merger G3G3 in Figure 12. Printed directly on the figure are estimates for the starburst timescale\nthat result from each fit. The three separate timescale measures can be placed on an equal footing by noting that\nthe FWHM of a Gaussian distribution is 2.35\u03c3, and fitting\nan decaying exponential to one side of a Gaussian yields\n\u03c4 \u2248 1.1\u03c3. For this particular case, the starburst has a distinct peak and extended tails compared to the Gaussian fit\n(i.e., a positive Kurtosis). Therefore, the timescale derived\nfrom the FWHM is much smaller than that derived from\nthe Gaussian fit. The starburst is very well-fitted by the\ntau\u2013model (so much so that the fit is difficult to see in Figure 12) which yields a slightly longer estimate of the star\nformation timescale.\nIn general, we note that nearly all models that employ\nthe n0med feedback have peaky star formation, and thus\nsmall FWHMs compared to the Gaussian or exponential\nestimates. However, because the star formation events are\ntypically irregular, we consider the best estimate of the star\nformation timescale to be an average between \u03c4 , 1.1\u03c3, and\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nConfirming our visual inspection of the SFRs shown in Figure 10, the n2med model has a much longer star\u2013formation\ntimescale than the n0med model. In additional, both models\ndisplay a trend for the star\u2013formation timescale to increase\nwith increasing mass ratio, however the uncertainties are\nlarge enough that this trend is not definitive. In particular,\nthe goodness of fit is only slightly reduced if the fit is fixed\nto have no mass-ratio dependence at all (\u03b1 = 0).\n4.4\n\nParameterizing Star Formation Enhancements\nDuring Galaxy Interactions\n\nThe star-formation histories shown in Figure 7 demonstrate\nclear signs of enhanced star formation during the merger.\nFurthermore, \u00a74.3.2 argues that this enhanced star formation is more robustly characterized by the amount of gas\nconsumed, rather than time\u2013dependent quantities such as\nthe maximum star formation rate, owing to uncertainties in\nthe adopted feedback model. However, we must also consider that the two galaxies which participate in the interaction would have converted some of their available gas into\nstars even in isolation, and therefore the gas consumption\nitself does not provide a complete characterization of the\nmerger\u2013driven star formation.\nA more explicit comparison between the merger\u2013driven\nstar formation and that of the isolated disks is presented\nin Figure 14, which shows several measures of star formation for the G3G3, G3G2, G3G1, and G3G0 mergers, in\neach column, from left to right, respectively. The top row\npresents the star\u2013formation rate (SFR) for the merger as\nwell as the summed SFR of the primary and satellite galaxies when evolved in isolation. For clarity, the difference between the two SFRs is shaded. The second row shows the\nratio of the merger SFR to the combined SFR of the isolated galaxies, clearly delineating when the rate is enhanced\nowing to the merger. The third row plots both SFRs divided\nby the stellar mass, which is also the inverse of the stellar\u2013\nmass doubling time, and is sometimes termed the \"specific\nSFR.\" The fourth row plots the SFRs divided by the gas\nmass, which is the inverse of the gas consumption timescale.\nFinally, the bottom row presents the gas consumption of\nboth the merger and the combined isolated galaxies with\nthe difference shaded.\nThere are several features present in Figure 14 that deserve more discussion. First, reinforcing the notion first presented in Figure 7, there is a clear correlation between interacting galaxy mass ratio and merger\u2013driven star formation.\nSignificant episodes of star formation only occur for mergers\n\n\f16\n\nCox et al.\n\nFigure 14. The rows from top to bottom show the star-formation rate (SFR), SFR normalized by the combined SFR of both isolated\ngalaxies, the SFR divided by the total stellar mass, the SFR divided by the total gas mass, and the gas consumption for mergers\nG3G3, G3G2, G3G1, and G3G0, from left to right. Panels show quantities during the interaction with a solid (red) line and for the\ncombined isolated galaxies with a dotted (green) line. The difference between the two lines is shaded to emphasize the merger\u2013driven\nstar formation. All simulations shown employ the n0med feedback model. The burst efficiency (see \u00a74.4.1) is printed in the bottom row\nfor each interaction.\n\nbetween galaxies of nearly equal mass. For mergers between\ngalaxies with a large mass ratio, such as G3G0, the cumulative star\u2013formation history is nearly indistinguishable from\nthe primary G3 evolved in isolation.\nBy comparing the star\u2013formation history of G3G3 to\nthat of G3G2, we uncover another interesting feature of Figure 14. Namely, these two interactions have similar peak\nlevels of star formation, even though the total amount of\ngas consumed is much less for the higher mass ratio G3G2\ninteraction. This feature of the star\u2013formation history emphasizes that caution needs to be exercised when attempting\nto quantify the merger\u2013driven star formation.\nAs a final comment, we note that all models except\nG3G0 show elevated star formation at the end of the inter-\n\naction (T \u2248 6 Gyr) compared to the primary G3 evolved in\nisolation, as indicated by the normalized SFR shown in the\nsecond row of Figure 14. Therefore, most measures of the\nthe merger\u2013driven star formation are subject to uncertainties that depend upon the duration over which the simulations follow the merger (if the simulation was run for long\nenough, all galaxies would consume essentially all of their\ninitial allotment of gas). In practice, these errors are quite\nsmall, which we estimate to be \u223c 0.03 from the differential\ngas consumption (bottom row of Figure 14) if the simulation is followed for 1 Gyr prior to, or later than, the current\n6 Gyr we adopt as a standard.\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fThe effect of galaxy mass ratio on merger\u2013driven starbursts\n\n17\n\nwhere e1:1 is the burst efficiency for equal mass mergers,\nMsat and Mprimary are the mass of the satellite and primary,\nrespectively, and \u03b3 fixes the mass ratio dependence. Performing a least-squares fit to our entire set of fiducial mergers we\nfind e1:1 =0.55 and \u03b3=0.69. This fit is shown as a solid line\nin Figure 15.\nOwing to the relatively small star-formation enhancement in large mass ratio mergers (Msat /Mprimary < 0.2),\nand the systematic overestimate in the regime provided by\nthe best\u2013fit Eq. 5, we also consider an alternate form for\nthe burst efficiency that is fixed to zero when the mass ratio\nMsat /Mprimary is below e0 and is\n\u201e\n\u00ab\u03b3\nMsat\ne=\n\u2212 e0\n,\n(6)\nMprimary\n\nFigure 15.

The vertical line below the key shows our estimated error\nin burst efficiency of \u00b10.07 owing to uncertainties in the feedback\nmodel and the duration in which the simulation is followed.\n\n4.4.1\n\nBurst Efficiency\n\nIn order to quantify the merger\u2013driven star formation, we\nwish to define a simple, useful, and robust parameterization\nof the star formation owing solely to the interaction. To\nthis end, we are motivated by the discussion of \u00a74.3.2 to\nintroduce the \"burst efficiency\" e, as\ne\n\n=\n\n(fraction of gas consumed during interaction) \u2212\n(fraction of gas consumed by constituent\n(4)\ngalaxies evolved in isolation, during the\nsame time period).\n\nThe burst efficiency is the fractional amount of stars that\nare formed (or equivalently, the gas that is consumed) during the merger that would not have formed in isolation.\nFigure 15 shows the burst efficiency for our fiducial merger\nseries and reaffirms what was implicit in Figures 7 and 14;\nnamely, merger\u2013driven star formation is only significant during mergers where the participating galaxies are comparable\nin mass.\nThe burst efficiency appears to be a smoothly decreasing function of the merger mass ratio and its parameterization may be useful for future studies of galaxy formation. In fact, such a parameterization has already been introduced by Somerville, Primack & Faber (2001, see their\nFig. 1) based upon a much smaller set of data (the simulations of Mihos & Hernquist 1994a, 1996), and used in their\nsemi-analytic models. Following Somerville et al. (2001), we\nadopt the following form for the burst efficiency:\n\u00ab\u03b3\n\u201e\nMsat\n(5)\ne = e1:1\nMprimary\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nwhen the mass ratio Msat /Mprimary is greater than e0 . Performing a least squares fit to our fiducial mergers yields\ne1:1 =0.56, \u03b3=0.50, and e0 =0.09, although the reduced \u03c72\nis nearly unchanged if e0 is manually set to anything less\nthan 0.11 (including 0, in which case the fit is identical to\nEq. 5). In other words, our fiducial set of mergers are consistent with there being no enhancement of star formation\nbelow a mass ratio of 9:1, although the data doesn't necessarily require this. The best fit to Eq. 6 is shown in Figure 15\nas a dotted line.\nA number of other fitting formula are also possible for\nthe burst efficiency, such as single and broken power-laws,\nand various polynomials, however with the small number of\ndata points and the associated uncertainties in calculating\nthe burst efficiency, no one formula was statistically better\nthan any other formula. Hence, we adopt Eq. 5 to describe\nthe burst efficiency.\nFor comparison, the Somerville et al. (2001) fit to the\nMihos & Hernquist data using Eq. 5 yielded e1:1 = 0.75\nand \u03b3 = 0.18, when the progenitor disks did not include\na stellar bulge, and e1:1 = 0.75 and \u03b3 = 1.16 when they\ndid. The consistency of e1:1 indicates that the presence of\na bulge does not affect the burst efficiency of major mergers. We also note that a value of 0.75 for e1:1 is about 50%\nlarger than our preferred value, indicating that the models\nemployed here are less efficient at turning gas into stars than\nthose of Mihos & Hernquist. In fact, this difference is similar\nto that found previously by Cox et al. (2006) who showed\nthat the feedback model and the newer version of SPH employed produce these changes. Our value of \u03b3 is between the\nSomerville et al. (2001) value, a trend that is likely driven\nby the fact that our primary galaxy G3 has a bulge\u2013to\u2013disk\nratio that is lower than in their model. We will attempt to\nexplore these dependencies in more detail in the following\nsection.\n\n5\n\nADDITIONAL MERGER SIMULATIONS\n\nThe previous section detailed the outcome of 10 mergers,\nincluding 6 unequal mass mergers, between our four galaxy\nmodels. In this section we perform a number of additional\nmerger simulations in order to explore several interesting,\nand particularly relevant regions of parameter space; the\nmerging orbit and the structure of the progenitor disk,\nspecifically the extent of the gaseous disk, the bulge-to-disk\nratio, and the gas fraction of the progenitor disk.\n\n\f18\n\nCox et al.\n\nFigure 16. Star\u2013formation history and gas consumption for the G3G2 (top) and G3G1 (bottom) unequal mass interactions when merged\non orbits that have varying amounts of angular momentum, as set by the pericentric distance Rperi , which is listed in the top of each\ncolumn in units of kpc. All merger orbits are inclined by 30\u25e6 and nearly parabolic (eccentricity 0.95). The fiducial encounters all assumed\nRperi = 13.6 kpc when the primary was G3. The burst efficiency is listed in the bottom of each column. All mergers use the n2med\nfeedback model.\n\n5.1\n\nVariations in Orbit\n\nAs outlined previously (\u00a71 and \u00a74.3), the enhancement of\nstar formation during galaxy interactions originates from\ntidal forces that attend the merger. In particular, the close\npassage between the interacting galaxies produces bar\u2013like\nstructures in the stellar disk that torque gas into the galaxy\ncenter. Figure 8 shows that this occurs in both the primary\nand the satellite. The nearly prograde mergers that we have\ntracked up to this point produce a relatively strong bar owing to resonances between the orbits of stars in the primary\ndisk and the passage of the satellite galaxy. However, alternative orbits and orientations of the interaction will affect\nthe strength of the tidal force as well as the resonances excited within the disk, and therefore the resulting starburst.\nTo determine how the star-formation history depends\nupon the orbital angular momentum and disk orientation of\nthe merging galaxies we have run two series of interactions\nusing the G3G2 and G3G1 mergers. In the first series, we\nsystematically change the orbital angular momentum which,\nin practice, is modulated by the pericentric distance Rperi .\n\nAll other parameters are identical to the fiducial mergers.\nThe star-formation histories and gas consumption fractions\nresulting from this set of mergers are shown in Figure 16.\nFor both the G3G2 and G3G1 interactions the maximum\ngas consumption occurs when Rperi = 6.8 kpc, or roughly\n(6.8/2.85 \u2248) 2.4 times the stellar scale radius of G3. The\nincreasing gas consumption for more direct interactions supports the connection between tidal forces and merger-driven\nstar formation. We also note that the two interactions with\nRperi less than 6.8 kpc consume slightly less gas than orbits\nwith larger Rperi . This trend is likely a result of the disruptive nature of nearly head\u2013on collisions as well the difficulty\nof capturing shock\u2013induced star formation within SPH (although recent star formation models have been formulated\nto address this shortcoming; Barnes (see, e.g., 2004)).\nThe second series of runs systematically alters the satellite orientation. While the fiducial set of mergers assumes\nthat the orbital plane was inclined by 30\u25e6 with respect to\nthe disk of the primary galaxy, this series varied the inclination. A range of mergers are performed in which the inclic 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fThe effect of galaxy mass ratio on merger\u2013driven starbursts\n\n19\n\nFigure 17.

Note that the fiducial set of mergers were inclined by 30\u25e6 . The burst efficiency is listed\nin the bottom of each column. All mergers use the n2med feedback model.\n\nnation is prograde (0\u25e6 ), polar (90\u25e6 ), and retrograde (180\u25e6 ),\nas well as several in between. Figure 17 shows the resulting\nstar formation and gas consumption for these runs. As expected, mergers in which the orbit of the secondary is aligned\nwith the primary disk, i.e., prograde orientations, produce\nthe strongest tidal responses in the disk and therefore the\nlargest bursts of star formation.\n\nIt is likely that similar results would follow from other\norbital explorations, such as the initial separation between\nthe two galaxies, as well as the energy of the initial orbit. Interestingly, the largest starburst event in the series of major\nmerger interaction studied by Cox (2004) was a zero net angular momentum orbit. In short, we expect any factor that\nefficiently strips gas of its angular momentum, including collisions, or increasing the tidal coupling between the satellite\norbital motion and stars in the disk of the primary will lead\nto the most substantial bursts of star formation.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n5.2\n\nVariations in the Extent of Gaseous Disk\n\nMotivated by observations (see, e.g., Broeils & van Woerden\n1994), the galaxy models that form the basis for this work\nassume that the distribution of gas in the disk is more extended than the stars. Specifically, the gas has an exponential scale radius \u03b1 = 3 times that of the stellar disk.\nAs a result, there is a significant quantity of gas at large\nradii. This extended gas does not significantly contribute to\nthe nuclear starburst. Instead, the merger remnant contains\na large quantity of gas in both a shock\u2013heated hot phase\n(Struck 1997; Cox et al. 2004, 2006) as well as in a cold\nstar-forming disk.\nIn order to discern how the assumed distribution of gas\ninfluences the burst efficiency, we have run a number of tests\nthat alter the distribution of cold gas in the primary G3\ngalaxy. Figure 18 shows an example of our typical result,\nnamely, the extended gas distribution leads to an increased\nestimate of the burst efficiency. For the case shown in Figure 18, the fiducial G3 galaxy model has been altered to have\n\n\f20\n\nCox et al.\n\nFigure 18. Star formation and gas consumption for two G3G2\nmergers.

The case on the\nright is also similar to the fiducial interaction except the primary\nG3 galaxy model has \u03b1 = 3 and all gas beyond 20 kpc has been\nremoved from the initial disk. The burst efficiency is indicated in\nthe bottom panel for each case. Both mergers are run using the\nn0med feedback model.\n\n\u03b1 = 1, while keeping the remaining parameters, including\nthe total gas mass, unchanged. In short, the vigorous star\nformation in the isolated primary consumes a larger fraction\nof the available gas and results in a lower burst efficiency.\nIn additional experiments we merged models with the\nfiducial G3 distribution of gas (\u03b1 = 3), however all gas\nbeyond a cutoff radius (Rcutoff ) is removed. In essence,\nthese galaxy models have much less gas, yet the inner,\nstar\u2013forming gas distribution is unchanged. As shown in\nFigure 18, the resulting star\u2013formation histories are unchanged. Even though the fractional gas consumption increases markedly (compared to the second column in Figure 14), owing to a corresponding increase in the gas consumption of the isolated system, the resulting burst efficiencies are nearly identical. These experiments indicate that\nthe burst efficiency is predominantly a function of the density distribution of gas in the progenitor systems rather than\npurely the spatial distribution of gas.\n5.3\n\nVariations in Bulge-to-Disk Ratio\n\nOne of the most significant results from the work of\nMihos & Hernquist (1994a, 1996) was the discovery that\nthe internal structure of the primary galaxy can strongly\ninfluence the efficiency of the starburst. Specifically, these\nworks showed that a massive stellar bulge stabilizes the disk\nagainst tidal perturbations and suppress strong inflows of\ngas that lead to starbursts. In the case of minor mergers,\nthe presence of a bulge may eliminate the merger\u2013driven\nstarburst completely, while during a major merger the bulge\nmay simply delay the starburst until the final coalescence of\nthe two galaxies.\n\nFigure 19. Similar to Figure 15 except here the burst efficiency\nis shown for three series of runs with different values of the bulge\u2013\nto\u2013disk ratio (B/D) in the primary G3 galaxy.\n\nThe absence of any discernible burst of star\u2013formation\nfor the G3G1 and G3G0 minor mergers presented in \u00a74 support the notion that the presence of a stellar bulge can\nsuppress merger\u2013driven star formation when the mass ratio\nis large. Furthermore, this burst suppression persists even\nthough the bulge adopted for the fiducial G3 model is only\n20% the mass of the stellar disk, i.e., the bulge\u2013to\u2013disk ratio\n(B/D) is 0.2, or about 50% smaller than in the models of\nMihos & Hernquist where B/D= 0.33. In order to provide\na more direct comparison to their work and further assess\nthe effects of bulge mass on the merger\u2013driven starburst,\nwe have run a number of additional interactions where the\nbulge mass of the fiducial G3 model is altered such that\nthere is no bulge at all (B/D= 0.0), or where the bulge mass\nis increased by a factor of 2.5 (B/D= 0.5). All other parameters, including the fiducial merging orbits and the satellite\ngalaxies (G2, G1, and G0), are left unchanged.\nFigure 19 shows the burst efficiency as a function of\nmerger mass ratio for our series of mergers in which the\nbulge mass of the G3 primary is varied. As expected, there is\na systematic correlation for large mass ratio mergers to have\nsmaller burst efficiencies when the bulge mass increases. For\nexample, the bulgeless G3G1 (5.8:1) merger has a burst efficiency of 0.16, which is three times larger than the burst\nefficiency for the model with the most massive bulge (B/D=\n0.5). We also note that the burst efficiency is insensitive to\nthe bulge mass when the merger mass ratio is near unity, in\nagreement with Mihos & Hernquist (1996).\nUsing Eq. 5, the best fit to each series of B/D mergers\nis determined and overplotted in Figure 19. All fits have the\nidentical value of e1:1 , 0.49, a result of the constant burst\nefficiency during major mergers. The value of \u03b3, which sets\nthe mass ratio dependence, is 0.61, 0.74, and 1.02 for the series with B/D= 0.0, 0.2 (the fiducial), and 0.5, respectively.\nIt should be pointed out that the best fit for the fiducial sec 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fThe effect of galaxy mass ratio on merger\u2013driven starbursts\nries is slightly different than that reported in \u00a74.4.1 because\nhere only the G3Gx series is analyzed.\nEven though the qualitative relationship between\nbulge mass and burst efficiency is in agreement with\nMihos & Hernquist (1994a), their bulgeless minor merger\nproduced a significant burst of star formation. The result\nis a burst efficiency (\u223c 0.7) that is much larger than our\nbulgeless series. Actually, this value is larger than any of\nour interactions, major or minor. This discrepancy was also\nnoted in \u00a74.4.1, and is likely a result of three differences\nbetween their modeling and ours.\nFirst, the feedback model and the newer entropy\u2013\nconserving version of SPH employed here both result in less\nintense episodes of merger\u2013driven star formation (Cox et al.\n2006). Second, the models employed by Mihos & Hernquist\nadopt a circular orbit for the satellite, which increases the\ntidal coupling to stars in the disk and produces a larger response. Lastly, the large burst efficiency found by Mihos &\nHernquist is inflated by the very inefficient star formation\nassumed to occur in their quiescent disk. Such levels of star\nformation appear to be insufficient to match more recent\nobservations (Kennicutt 1998).\nWhile these three arguments outline why our burst efficiencies are more modest - and we believe, more accurate\n- than prior calculations, the previous sections of this paper suggest that a number of the parameters for our fiducial\nencounters are sub\u2013optimal at producing the largest merger\u2013\ndriven star formation event (and hence burst efficiency). We\ntherefore performed a small number of additional simulations using a bulgeless version of our fiducial G3G1 merger,\nonly we placed the satellite G1 on a co\u2013planar (0\u25e6 ), close\npassage (Rperi = 6.8 kpc) orbit in order to maximize the\nmerger\u2013induced starburst (this orbit was motivated by the\nresults of \u00a75.1).\nThe star\u2013formation history during the interaction with\nthe maximum burst efficiency, as determined from our small\nG3G1 parameter search, is shown in Figure 20. We have\nalso shown corresponding interactions when the modified\nbulgeless G3 model has bulge\u2013to\u2013disk ratios of 0.2, similar\nto the fiducial G3 model, and 0.5. Even with the large degree\nof parameter manipulation the maximum burst efficiency for\nthe bulgeless run is only 0.19. While this is \u223c 20% larger\nthan the the bulgeless G3G1 in the fiducial encounter, and\nabout \u223c 4 times the fiducial G3G1 merger, it is still far\nbelow the \u223c 0.70 found by Mihos & Hernquist (1994a).\n5.4\n\nVariations in Gas Fraction\n\nIn our final set of additional merger simulations, we vary the\ngas fraction of our fiducial G3 galaxy model. To this end, the\ntotal mass in the disk is kept fixed, yet the distribution of\nmass, i.e. the amount in the gaseous versus the stellar disk,\nis varied for each model. All other parameters, including\nthe interaction orbit and the satellite galaxies (G2, G1, and\nG0) remain unchanged from their fiducial values. Figure 21\npresents the star formation history, the gas consumption,\nand the burst efficiency for the fiducial G3G2 interaction\nplus two additional mergers when the G3 primary has a\nlarger gas fraction, f , defined as the mass of the gas disk\ndivided by the total (gas plus stars) disk mass.\nFigure 21 exemplifies the generic outcome of all interactions that test the gas fraction of the primary, namely,\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n21\n\nFigure 20. Star formation during unequal mass interactions as\na function of primary bulge mass. The interaction is similar to\nthe fiducial G3G1, except the orbit is co\u2013planar (0\u25e6 ) and has less\nangular momentum (see text) in order to produce the maximum\nstarburst. All runs are performed with the the n0med feedback\nmodel.\n\nincreasing the primary's gas fraction decreases the burst efficiency. In effect, the result is similar to that presented in \u00a75.2\nfor the distribution of gas and follows from a similar cause\n- the increased gas consumption in the isolated primary. In\nboth scenarios, the initial disk converts a large fraction its\ngas into stars regardless of whether the interaction occurs\nor not.\n\n6\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn this paper we perform a series of numerical simulations\nthat follow the interaction and merger of binary galaxies\nwith various mass ratios. Our analysis quantifies the starbursts that result from the tidal forces that attend the\nmerger. As expected, mergers between galaxies with nearly\nequal mass generate the largest tidal forces, and therefore\nproduce the most intense bursts of star formation. Mergers\nbetween galaxies with a large mass ratio produce relatively\nlittle, if any, enhancement in star formation above quiescent\n\n\f22\n\nCox et al.\ngalaxy merger: (1) significant starbursts occur for only specialized scenarios, e.g., close passage, co-planar orientations,\nwhen the primary disk does not contain a bulge, and (2)\neven in this extreme scenario, the burst efficiency is still\nonly . 0.25, i.e., a single unequal mass merger does not\nconvert a large fraction of gas into stars.\n\n6.1\n\nFigure 21. Star formation history and gas consumption for the\nfiducial G3G2 merger and two similar interactions where the primary G3 galaxy has a larger gas fraction. As with Figure 14, the\ndifference between the merger and isolated evolution is shaded for\nclarity. The burst efficiency is displayed in the lower\u2013right of the\nbottom panel. We note that the simulation here were run with\nthe n2med feedback model while the mergers shown in Figure 14\nemployed the n0med model.\n\nevolution, yielding a correlation between merger\u2013driven star\nformation and decreasing merging galaxy mass ratio.\nTo quantify the relationship between merging galaxy\nmass ratio and merger-driven starburst, we introduce the\nburst efficiency (Eq. 5) as the fraction of gas that is converted into stars during the interaction which does not occur\nif the galaxies are evolved in isolation. The burst efficiency is\ndemonstrated to be robust to uncertainties in the feedback\nparameterization unlike the strength or duration of the starburst.\nWhile the burst efficiency resulting from collisions between galaxies of equivalent mass is relatively insensitive\nto the details of the merging event such as the orbit, the\ngalaxy orientation, and the properties of the merging galaxies (Mihos & Hernquist 1996; Springel 2000; Cox 2004), this\nis not the case when the participating galaxies are unequal\nin mass.\nBy performing a large number of additional merger simulations, we have quantified the effects of merging orbit and\norientation, as well as properties of the progenitor disk.\nWe find that close passage, co-planar orbits produce the\nmost significant bursts of star formation, consistent with\nthe expectations of the tidally induced origin for the starbursts. We also find that the structure of the progenitor disk\nstrongly influences the merger-driven star formation. In particular, the presence of a centrally-concentrated stellar bulge\nstabilizes the disk and suppresses merger-driven star formation. The distribution and mass of the gaseous disk also\ninfluences the starburst. In general, increasing the amount\nof gas at densities above \u03c1crit , the threshold density for star\nformation to commence, decreases the burst efficiency.\nThese results lead us to conclude the following two\nfacts about merger-driven starburst during an unequal mass\n\nComparison to Previous Simulations\n\nOur work is closely related to, and consistent with, a number\nof prior studies of the gas dynamics during the interaction\nand merger of unequal mass galaxies (e.g., Hernquist 1989;\nMihos & Hernquist 1994a; Hernquist & Mihos 1995). While\nall work performed to date demonstrates that minor mergers\ncan induce radial inflows of gas that result in periods of enhanced star formation, our models typically result in smaller\nburst efficiencies (see \u00a74.3.1 and \u00a74.4.1) owing to three key\ndifferences in the studies.\nFirst, as shown in Cox et al. (2006) using simulations of\nmajor mergers, the more complex treatment of the interstellar medium produces more hot gas, and suppresses star formation. In particular, relaxing the isothermal gas assumption commonly employed in the work of Mihos & Hernquist,\nincluding the \"conservative\u2013entropy\" (Springel & Hernquist\n2002) version of SPH, and the more efficient feedback models\nof Cox et al. (2006) all serve to suppress the merger\u2013induced\nstarburst, and lower the burst efficiency.\nSecond, the set of simulations employed by\nMihos & Hernquist (1994a) and Hernquist & Mihos\n(1995) followed satellite galaxies that were initially placed\non a circular orbit. In contrast, we follow parabolic orbits\nwhich are motivated by cosmological expectations (see \u00a74).\nThese more energetic orbits lead to less direct coupling\nbetween the orbital angular momentum of the satellite and\nthe disk of the primary, and therefore are less conducive to\nan intense inflow of disk gas.\nLastly, as noted in \u00a75.3 and in Cox et al. (2006), the\nstar formation model employed by Mihos & Hernquist is less\nefficient than current observations suggest (e.g., Kennicutt\n1998). The primary result of this assumption is that the\nquiescent galaxy consumes much less gas when evolved in\nisolation and the merger burst efficiency is overestimated.\nWhile there are additional differences between the\ngalaxy models employed by these previous studies, namely\nthey use less massive and less concentrated dark matter halos, and the baryonic components are not as faithful a representation of observed galaxies in the local Universe, the\ntests performed in \u00a75 indicate that these differences play a\nsecondary role to the three items outlined above. Even when\nwe modified every possible parameter to maximize the burst\nefficiency, our value was still only one\u2013third as large as the\nprevious results.\n\n6.2\n\nComparison to Observations\n\nWhile observational studies have already established\na clear link between star formation and galaxy interactions (as measured by close pairs or morphology,\ne.g., Larson & Tinsley 1978; Joseph & Wright 1985;\nKennicutt et al.\n1987;\nBarton Gillespie et al.\n2003;\nLambas et al. 2003; Nikolic et al. 2004), only recently\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fThe effect of galaxy mass ratio on merger\u2013driven starbursts\nhas it been possible to specifically address whether or not\nthis correlation holds when the close galaxy pairs have\nrather disparate luminosities. In particular, Woods et al.\n(2006) reported no correlation between star formation\n(as measured by H\u03b1) and close galaxy pairs in the CfA2\nRedshift Survey when the magnitude difference is greater\nthan 2, and a more recent study using a larger sample from\nSDSS found that the satellite galaxy indeed shows enhanced\nstar formation while the primary did not (Woods & Geller\n2007).\nAssuming that luminosity traces mass (and modulo any\nsystematic affects owing to merger\u2013driven star formation),\nthe studies by Woods et al. imply that there is no observational evidence for induced star formation in the primary\ngalaxy when the merger mass ratio is greater than \u223c 6:1,\nwhile the satellite is more likely to experience a starburst.\nTaken at face value, our results naturally recover this observed trend. Our merger models produce little, if any, globally enhanced star formation for merger mass ratios below\n5:1, and when they do, it requires very specific circumstances\n(bulgeless primary, co\u2013planar, close\u2013passage orbit). It is also\nintriguing that Figure 8 hints that the satellite is much more\nsusceptible to enhanced star\u2013formation during the interaction, which also seems consistent with the observations.\nIn contrast to the statistical studies, there are a multitude of observations that suggest that individual systems\nare currently undergoing minor merger induced episodes of\nstar formation (see the list in \u00a71). To determine whether\nthese specific galaxies are consistent with the statistical studies requires more extensive modeling of individual systems, as has been performed in a few cases already (see, e.g., Mihos & Bothun 1997; Laine & Heller 1999;\nSalo & Laurikainen 2000). It is possible that many of these\nsystems have unique satellite orbits, or that the effects of\nmultiple minor mergers which occur simultaneously is more\ndramatic than the binary mergers that we have followed\nhere. Models of individual galaxies, and their direct comparison to observations across many wavebands may also yield\nimportant constraints to the star formation and feedback\nmodels.\n6.3\n\nImplications for Dwarf Galaxies\n\nWhile the focus of our analysis has been on the global\nproperties of merger-driven star formation, Figure 8 clearly\ndemonstrates that the star formation history of the satellite\ngalaxy can be enhanced far more dramatically than that of\nthe primary galaxy (which dominates the global star formation). Such a scenario appears to be observed in the large\nsample of SDSS galaxies studied by Woods & Geller (2007)\nand also in the nearby Universe, e.g., both M82 and NGC\n3077 are currently experiencing periods of intense star formation after recent close passages to M81 (Yun et al. 1994;\nWalter et al. 2002; Ott et al. 2003). These tidally\u2013induced\nepisodes of star formation may also have implications for\nthe detection of satellite galaxies and the inferred cosmological merger rate (see, e.g., Berrier et al. 2006).\n6.4\n\nThe Mass\u2013Dependence of Star Formation\n\nOne interesting feature present in Figure 15 is the systematic dependence of e1:1 , the burst efficiency for an equal\u2013\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n23\n\nmass major merger, on primary galaxy mass. Specifically,\nthe burst efficiency is 0.46 for the G3G3 major merger and\nsteadily increases to 0.61 for the G0G0 major merger.\nThe increasing burst efficiency e1:1 with decreasing system mass is a direct byproduct of systematic changes in the\nmerger\u2013induced star formation compared to that in the isolated disks. One possibility for this trend is the systematic\nincrease in gas fraction with decreasing galaxy mass that is\nassumed for our galaxy models. However, the results of \u00a75.4\nsuggest that increasing the gas fraction actually decreases\nthe burst efficiency.\nA more likely scenario is that the density\u2013dependent\ndescription of star formation, including the explicit density\nthreshold \u03c1crit for star formation to commence, is producing\nthe large variation in burst efficiency with mass. In particular, Figure 2 shows that the quiescent star formation\nspans three orders of magnitude from G3 (\u223c 1 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ) to\nG0 (\u223c 10\u22123 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ), while the peak star formation during the major mergers are much more comparable (G3G3\n\u223c 25M\u2299 yr\u22121 and G0G0 \u223c 3M\u2299 yr\u22121 ). The significant increase in merger\u2013induced star formation compared to quiescent levels was noted in \u00a74.3 which determined that the\nG3G3 merger enhances star formation by a mere order of\nmagnitude while the G0G0 merger enhances star formation\nby a whopping three orders of magnitude.\nMore work is required to determine the precise nature of\nthe mass\u2013dependence of star formation and how this trend\ndepends upon uncertainties associated with our implementation of star formation. Moreover, a systematic comparison to the observed relationship between specific star formation rate and stellar mass, i.e. downsizing (Cowie et al. 1996;\nBrinchmann & Ellis 2000; Kauffmann et al. 2003), may elucidate the physical mechanisms responsible.\n6.5\n\nInput for Future Studies\n\nQuantifying the merger-driven star formation as a function of merger mass ratio is useful for a variety of further\nstudies. In particular, semi-analytic models of galaxy formation (SAMs) often find that merger-driven star formation is necessary to reproduce the luminosity function and\nnumber counts of Lyman-break galaxies (Somerville et al.\n2001) and sub-millimeter galaxies (Guiderdoni et al. 1998;\nBaugh et al. 2005). To this end, we have followed the\nmethodology of Somerville et al. (2001) and introduced the\nburst efficiency (see \u00a74.4.1 and Eq. 5) in order to parameterize the star formation enhancement that occurs during\ngalaxy interactions as a function of participant mass ratio.\nIn Table 3 we list the best fit parameters to Eq.5 for\nall models explored in this paper, including the fiducial series of runs (\u00a74.4.1), and all additional models (orbits in\n\u00a75.1, bulge\u2013to\u2013disk ratios in \u00a75.3, and gas fractions of the\nprogenitor disk in \u00a75.4) that use the G3 primary galaxy.\nA quick inspection of Table 3 indicates that the parameter\ne1:1 , which normalizes Eq. 5 to the burst efficiency of a major merger, changes relatively little across this wide range\nof tests, although it may depend on galaxy mass (see the\ndiscussion of \u00a76.4). On the other hand, the parameter \u03b3,\nwhich determines the mass ratio scaling, has a significant\ndependence on orbital inclination and bulge\u2013to\u2013disk ratio,\na mild dependence on the orbital angular momentum, and\na negligible dependence upon gas fraction.\n\n\f24\n\nCox et al.\n\nTable 3.

Unfortunately, as shown in \u00a74.3.3, uncertainties in the feedback\nmodel do not permit an unambiguous characterization of the\nstar\u2013formation timescale. There is hope, however, that better constraints can be placed on the feedback model through\nmore detailed modeling of individual systems systems or by\ncomparison to the observed distribution of star formation\nrates.\nFinally, we emphasize that the accretion events followed\nin this study drive structural evolution which is also an interesting and relevant input parameter to future studies of\ngalaxy formation and evolution. In particular, the morphology of the merger remnants (see Figs. 3\u20136) suggests that\nthe stellar and gaseous components react differently to the\ndynamical perturbation and that the remnant appears to\nbe a systematically earlier Hubble type than the original\ndisk. This is also consistent with the surface density profile\nshown in Figure 9, which shows an excess of mass at small\nradii indicative of the formation of a stellar bulge.\n\n6.6\n\nOther Considerations\n\nAs a final comment, we note that the present simulations\nlack several physical processes that may play a role in the\nresults we have presented. First, we have not included the\nrecycling of gas from stellar winds and supernovae, an omission that would increase the gas fraction as a function of\ntime. Another process that may increase the gas content on\nlong timescales is the accretion of gas from the cosmological\ngrowth of structure. While we eventually intend to incor-\n\nporate these effects into our modeling (as has been done\nby several authors already, see, e.g, Tornatore et al. 2004;\nScannapieco et al. 2005; Stinson et al. 2006), the relatively\nsmall difference (\u223c 15%) in the burst efficiency for runs of\ndifferent initial gas fractions (see \u00a75.4) supports the notion\nthat this omission has a relatively minor effect on the star\nformation that results from a single merger. However, for\nthe long\u2013term evolution, and for the absolute star\u2013formation\nrate, these effects are likely to be important.\nIt should also be pointed out that our galaxy models are\ncalibrated to match low redshift observations of disk galaxies. While we have surveyed a small portion of the parameter\nspace that might correspond to properties of disks at higher\nredshift, e.g., higher gas fractions and more compact initial disks, and therefore have some indication of the changes\nthat may occur, future studies will need to investigate these\ndependencies in more depth.\nWe have also not included accreting black holes and\ntheir associated feedback into the models presented here.\nRecent work has shown that these processes may play a significant role during major mergers, resulting in the formation of quasars (Hopkins et al. 2006), and leading to remnants that reside on the MBH \u2212 \u03c3 relation (Di Matteo et al.\n2005; Springel et al. 2005b; Robertson et al. 2006) and\nhave the colors (Springel et al. 2005a) and other properties (Cox et al. 2006; Robertson et al. 2006) appropriate for\npresent day elliptical galaxies. While the minor interactions\nwe discuss here are a likely fueling mechanism for many\nforms of nuclear activity (see, e.g., Hopkins & Hernquist\n2006), because significant black hole growth requires large\nquantities of gas (approximately the entire content of the initial disks) to be driven to the galactic center, it is likely that\nblack hole growth and feedback play a relatively minor part\nduring most of the unequal mass interactions we follow here.\nOf course, the existence of a correlation between the black\nhole mass and the bulge mass (see, e.g., Magorrian et al.\n1998) suggests that at the very minimum the black hole imparts enough feedback to regulate its own growth.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Gurtina Besla, Suvendra Dutta, Lars Hernquist,\nPhil Hopkins, Jennifer Lotz, Greg Novak, Brant Robertson,\nand Josh Younger for helpful discussions, and Eric Bell for\nproviding his data in electronic form.
