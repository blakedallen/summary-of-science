In this framework, the gravitational description is weakly coupled when the\nrelativistic CFT is strongly coupled, and thus it becomes a promising tool to explore fundamental physics in the\nnon-perturbative regime. However, in spite of the enormous mathematical success of AdS/CFT correspondence, the\nexperimental applications of this idea have somewhat been braked by the fact that only few relativistic conformal\nfield theories at strong coupling are accessible experimentally.\nNevertheless, unlike what happens in the relativistic case, there exists a plenitude of non-relativistic conformal\nfield models that govern physics in different experimentally accessible areas such as condensed matter physics and\natomic or nuclear physics. From this perspective, the idea of generalizing AdS/CFT correspondence to the case of\nnon-relativistic conformal field theories has been proposed [5, 6]. In the non-relativistic case, the symmetry group is\nidentified with the conformal extension of the Galilei group, often called the Schr\u00f6dinger group. This identification is\ndue to the fact that there exist some analogies between the Minkowski conformal algebra and the Schr\u00f6dinger algebra\nin one dimension less. This analogy between both algebras has motivated the search of a geometric framework to\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: ayon-beato-at-fis.cinvestav.mx\naddress: gaston-at-df.uba.ar\n\u2021 Electronic address: hassaine-at-inst-mat.utalca.cl\n\u2020 Electronic\n\n\f2\nunderstand the Schr\u00f6dinger algebra. One pioneer work in this direction was the one done by Havas and Pleba\u0144ski\n[7], where they proposed to introduce the Schr\u00f6dinger symmetry as a sub-group of the infinite-dimensional group\nof Galilean conformal transformations of flat spacetime. A geometric picture of the Schr\u00f6dinger algebra and its\nrelations with the conformal algebra have been explained in [8], and this result was used in [9] to derive the invariant\nSchr\u00f6dinger metric in the context of the non-relativistic AdS/CFT correspondence. In turn, following the philosophy\nof the AdS/CFT holographic correspondence, the hope is that backgrounds whose (asymptotic) isometry group\nagrees with the Schr\u00f6dinger group would represent the gravity duals of some conformal quantum mechanical systems\nwith applications to condensed matter physics.1 Owing to this expectation, there has been an increasing interest\nin constructing solutions of string theory inspired models whose (asymptotic boundary) isometry group is given by\nthe Schr\u00f6dinger group. For instance, the embedding of such solutions and their analogues at finite temperature in\nstring theory were considered in [12\u201314] (see also references thereof). The effects of string inspired higher-curvature\ncorrections of these spaces were first analyzed in [15], where it was shown that such higher order corrections lead to\nrenormalize the dynamical exponent of the dual conformal field theory. Here, we go deeper into the discussion on\nhigher-curvature actions and we argue that Schr\u00f6dinger invariant backgrounds arise as solutions of different theories\nof pure gravity in four and higher dimensions. It is relatively easy to show that Schr\u00f6dinger invariant spacetimes arise\nas solutions of Einstein gravity with negative cosmological constant, provided the support of matter fields. This can\nbe achieved with the introduction of some reasonable physical source, like a Proca field [5] and/or an Abelian Higgs\nfield in its broken phase [6]. However, solutions enjoying Schr\u00f6dinger symmetry are also possible in theories of gravity\nin absence of matter. The simplest example of a pure gravity theory for which solutions possessing full Schr\u00f6dinger\nsymmetry have been found is three\u2013dimensional Topologically Massive Gravity (TMG) with negative cosmological\nconstant [16]. This theory of gravity has attracted considerable attention the last three years, and, in particular,\none of the interesting features of TMG is precisely that it admits exact AdS wave solutions [17\u201322]; see below for a\nprecise definition of such spacetimes. While for generic values of the topological mass \u03bc and the cosmological constant\n\u039b = \u22121/l2 these AdS wave solutions are only partially Schr\u00f6dinger invariant 2 , it turns out that for the special fine\ntuning \u03bcl = 3 the solution exhibits the full Schr\u00f6dinger symmetry. This fine tuning corresponds to the critical point\nof the space of parameters at which the warped AdS3 solution of the theory has isometry group SL(2, R) \u00d7 U(1) with\na null U(1) direction [23]. More recently, in Ref. [24], the authors of the present paper have shown the existence of\nSchr\u00f6dinger invariant spaces for the so-called New Massive Gravity (NMG) introduced in Ref. [25].\nNevertheless, while the Schr\u00f6dinger invariant solutions of TMG and NMG are interesting in their own right,\ntheir relevance concerning the non-relativistic holographic correspondence one is trying to construct is somewhat\nquestionable. This is basically because its non-relativistic dual model would correspond to a theory with zero spatial\ndimensions. In turn, it is natural to ask for a higher-dimensional extension of this construction: Is there a theory\nof pure gravity in four (or higher) dimensions that admits solutions with Schr\u00f6dinger isometry group? Actually, one\ncan answer in the affirmative. One of the ideas of this paper is to look for such theories and go deepen into the\nSchr\u00f6dinger invariant sector of pure gravity.\nWe will argue that it is actually large the class of theories of higher-curvature gravity that admits solutions with\nSchr\u00f6dinger isometry group in four and higher dimensions. To construct a theory of pure gravity that admits exact\nsolutions with Schr\u00f6dinger isometry group in D > 3 dimensions, one can follow two different strategies: The first\none is resorting to the results of Ref. [15]. There, it was shown that the inclusion of higher-curvature terms in the\ngravitational action leads to renormalize the dynamical exponent of the Schr\u00f6dinger symmetric spaces (this exponent\nis usually denoted by z = \u03bd + 1). Then, one could in principle make inverse engineering and use the running equation\nthat relates the coupling constants of the gravitational Lagrangian to the dynamical exponent \u03bd in order to design the\nmodel. Here, instead, we will follow a rather different strategy. We will scan a wider class of higher-order gravitational\nLagrangians and exhaustively analyze the sectors of solutions that belong to a special type of Siklos spacetimes. This\nwill lead us to find several sectors of the space of solutions including, in particular, Schr\u00f6dinger spaces, together with\nlogarithmic solutions similar to those found in three dimensions.\nThe study of the higher-dimensional case starts in Sec. III with an analysis of the most general modified theory\nof gravity with quadratic dependence on the curvature. We find the explicit configurations for generic dimension,\nwhich allow us to identify several different sectors, apart from the Schr\u00f6dinger invariant one. For example, there are\ncritical points in the space of coupling constants for which a full degeneracy arises and the field equations are not\nonly satisfied for any dynamical exponent z but even for any AdS-wave profile function F . The corresponding set\nof theories includes (but is not limited to) the usual degenerate case of Chern-Simons gravity in D = 5. In analogy\n\n1\n2\n\nSee [10] and [11] for interesting discussions on holography in Schr\u00f6dinger spaces.\nAs shown below, this corresponds to the Galilei transformations together with an anisotropic rescaling\n\n\f3\nwith the three-dimensional configurations of TMG [17, 20] and NMG [24],3 we observe also the existence of other\ncritical values of the coupling constants for which Schr\u00f6dinger invariance is broken by the appearance of logarithmic\nbehaviors associated to the existence of scalar wave modes that saturate the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound (BF) of\nthe AdSD space on which the wave propagates. Some of these logarithmic decays are candidate to relax the usual\nAdS boundary conditions [29\u201331] in the context of theories with higher-curvature corrections, in perfect analogy with\nwhat occurs in three-dimensional massive gravities [32, 33].\nIn Sec. IV, we further generalize the results of section 3 by studying non-polynomials gravity modifications which\ndepend arbitrarily on the squared-curvature invariants; this is done by establishing a correspondence between such\na theory and the one with standard quadratic modifications. Since Siklos spacetimes are conformally equivalent\nto pp-waves, the metric configurations turn out to be persistent when a wide class of higher-curvature corrections\nare included, provided a suitable redefinition of the parameters. Within this context, and even if the existence of\nSchr\u00f6dinger invariant sectors is not specially related to conformal invariance, we find illustrative to explore in Sec. V\nthe particular example of adding to the D-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert action the conformally invariant deformation\nproportional to (C\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 C \u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 )D/4 , where C\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 is the Weyl tensor. Interestingly enough, we observe that only in\nfour dimensions the Schr\u00f6dinger invariant sector, the logarithmic sector, and the sector below the BF bound are\ngenuinely new configurations, while in arbitrary D > 4 the resulting solutions turn out to coincide with those of\nGeneral Relativity. We will also consider a rather different model of higher-curvature gravity in Sec. VI, given by the\nparity-violating Chern-Simons modification of General Relativity proposed by Jackiw and Pi [34], and we will show\nthat Schr\u00f6dinger invariant and Log configurations are also admitted as solutions in this theory. Finally, Section VII\nis devoted to our conclusions and further prospect. We include an Appendix describing the behavior of higher-order\ncurvature terms in presence of AdS waves.\nNote added. When our paper was being prepared for publication, Refs. [35] and [36] appeared, which consider\nsome of the configurations studied in this work, including the relevant ones for the recently proposed critical gravity\ntheories [37, 38].\n\nII.\n\nSCHR\u00d6DINGER ISOMETRY GROUP AND THE SIKLOS SPACETIMES\n\nFor the presentation to be self-contained, let us begin by reviewing some aspects of the Schr\u00f6dinger group. The\nSchr\u00f6dinger group has been defined in [39\u201341] as the largest group of space-time transformations which leaves the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation for a free particle invariant. Schr\u00f6dinger invariance has been considered in a wide variety of\nsituations, including celestial mechanics [8], non-relativistic field theory [42, 43], non-relativistic quantum mechanics\n[44], and hydrodynamics [45\u201349]. Mathematical aspects of the Schr\u00f6dinger symmetry have been analyzed, for instance,\nin [50]. The Schr\u00f6dinger group can be viewed as the semi-direct product of the connected static Galilei group together\nwith the SL(2, R) group, which includes time translation, dilatation, and special conformal transformations. This is\nan extension of the Lifshitz group, which is also considered in the holographic description of non-relativistic models\n[51].\nAs mentioned, the main idea of the proposal for a non-relativistic version of the AdS/CFT correspondence [5, 6] is\nto consider a metric whose isometry is given by the non-relativistic conformal Schr\u00f6dinger symmetry. In this context,\nwe will be concerned with the following class of metrics\n\u0013\n\u0012\nl2\ndt2\nds2 = 2 \u2212 2\u03bd + 2dtd\u03be + dr2 + d~x2 ,\n(1)\nr\nr\nwhere ~x is a d-dimensional vector, l is a constant associated to the curvature of the space, and \u03bd is the so-called\ndynamical exponent (this is also usually denoted by z = \u03bd + 1). For \u03bd = 0, the metric (1) corresponds to anti-de\nSitter spacetime and enjoys the full relativistic conformal symmetry. For an arbitrary value of the exponent \u03bd, this\nmetric exhibits as isometries the Galilei transformations on the space (t, ~x) as well as the dilatations transformations.\nIndeed, apart from the spacetime translations (t, ~x) 7\u2192 (t + b, ~x + ~\u03b4) and spatial rotations in the ~x-planes, ~x 7\u2192 R ~x\nwith R \u2208 SO(d), the metric (1) is invariant under the Galilean boosts\n1\n\u03c6~v (t, \u03be, r, ~x) = (t, \u03be + ~v * ~x \u2212 |~v |2 t, r, ~x \u2212 t~v ),\n2\n\n3\n\nSee Refs. [26, 27] for similar configurations appearing in bi-gravity and Born-Infeld gravity [28].\n\n(2)\n\n\f4\nas well as under dilations\n\u03c6a (t, \u03be, r, ~x) = (e(1+\u03bd)a t, e(1\u2212\u03bd)a \u03be, ea r, ea ~x).\n\n(3)\n\nFor the special value \u03bd = 1 of the dynamical exponent, the metric admits additionally a special conformal transformation given by the diffeomorphism\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03ba(|~x|2 + r2 )\nr\n~x\nt\n,\n(4)\n,\u03be \u2212\n,\n,\n\u03c6\u03ba (t, \u03be, r, ~x) =\n1 \u2212 \u03bat\n2(1 \u2212 \u03bat) 1 \u2212 \u03bat 1 \u2212 \u03bat\n\nand it is only in this case that the metric is said to enjoy the full Schr\u00f6dinger symmetry.\nThe symmetry transformations above are generated for each of its infinitesimal parameters \u01eb by a Killing vector K\nin the standard way, namely \u03c6\u01eb = \u03c60 + i\u01ebK + O(\u01eb2 ), which gives rise to the following set of Killing vectors\nMij = \u2212i(xi \u2202j \u2212 xj \u2202i ),\nKi = \u2212i(xi \u2202\u03be \u2212 t\u2202i ),\nPi = \u2212i\u2202i ,\nH = \u2212i\u2202t ,\nN = \u2212i\u2202\u03be ,\n\nD = \u2212i[(1 + \u03bd)t\u2202t + (1 \u2212 \u03bd)\u03be\u2202\u03be + r\u2202r + xi \u2202i ].\n\nFor \u03bd = 1 (i.e. z = 2), we find the additional special conformal generator\n\u0012\n\u0013\n|~x|2 + r2\n2\ni\nC = \u2212i t \u2202t \u2212\n\u2202\u03be + tr\u2202r + tx \u2202i .\n2\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\nThese Killing vectors realize the algebra whose non-vanishing commutation relations are\n\nBesides, when \u03bd = 1,\n\n[Mij , Mkl ] = i(\u03b4ik Mjl \u2212 \u03b4jk Mil + \u03b4il Mkj \u2212 \u03b4jl Mki ),\n[Mij , Pk ] = i(\u03b4ik Pj \u2212 \u03b4jk Pi ),\n[Mij , Kk ] = i(\u03b4ik Kj \u2212 \u03b4jk Ki ),\n[Pi , Kj ] = \u2212i\u03b4ij N,\n[H, Ki ] = iPi ,\n[D, Pi ] = iPi ,\n[D, Ki ] = \u2212i\u03bdKi\n[D, H] = i(1 + \u03bd)H,\n[D, N ] = i(1 \u2212 \u03bd)N.\n[D, C] = \u22122iC,\n\n[H, C] = \u2212iD,\n\n(7)\n(8)\n\nand in this case the algebra corresponds to the Schr\u00f6dinger algebra.\nNotice that the case \u03bd = 1 is special not only because it allows for the additional special conformal generator C, but\nalso because the generator N becomes a central element of the algebra, as it commutes additionally with the dilation\ngenerator D in this case.\nIn what follows, we will refer to the set of transformations involving the Galilei transformations Mij , Ki Pi , H,\nN and the dilatations D as the partial Schr\u00f6dinger symmetry. In the applications to condensed matter physics,\neach conformal system turns out to be characterized by the value of \u03bd its symmetry corresponds to. This helps to\nidentify the candidates to be the corresponding gravity duals of the form (1). For example, models describing itinerant\n(anti)ferromagnetic materials are thought to be described by the model with \u03bd = 2 (resp. with \u03bd = 1).\nHere, we are mainly interested in the class of metrics admitting the full (or partial) Schr\u00f6dinger symmetry (1).\nNevertheless, from the gravity viewpoint, it is interesting to consider first a more general (less symmetric) setting.\nThis is important to understand what is the appropriate setup these configurations arise in. With this motivation,\nwe consider an ansatz of the following form\n\u0003\nl2 \u0002\nds2 = 2 \u2212F (r)dt2 + 2dtd\u03be + dr2 + d~x2 ,\n(9)\nr\nwhere F is the only undetermined structural metric function, and it only depends on the coordinate r. This ansatz\ncorresponds to a particular class of the so-called Siklos spacetimes [52]. To be more precise, Siklos spacetimes\ncorrespond to metric (9) with a function F that depends on all the variables except the null coordinate \u03be. In\nparticular, for a vanishing structural function F = 0, we recover the metric of anti-de Sitter space in Poincar\u00e9\ncoordinates, while for F \u226a 1 this metric describes just a perturbation of AdS. In fact, the metric (9) and, more\ngenerally, the Siklos spacetimes, can also be obtained from the AdS one by a generalized Kerr-Schild transformation\n(see Appendix). Consequently, they can be though as describing exact gravitational waves propagating along the AdS\nspacetime [53] (AdS-waves). In fact, they become the particular case, admitting a Killing field, of the more general\nexact gravitational waves propagating in presence of a cosmological constant originally found by Garc\u0131\u0301a and Pleba\u0144ski\n[54].4\n\n4\n\nSee Refs. [55\u201357] for further generalizations.\n\n\f5\nIn the context of higher-order gravity theories it has been observed in many cases that the on-shell profile function\nF of exact gravitational waves behaves as an exact scalar massive mode [20, 24, 58], since it satisfies a Klein-Gordon\nequation\n\u0003F = m2 F,\n\n(10)\n\nfor some effective mass m, and where \u0003 stands for the d'Alambertian operator. For example, in the case of the profile\nF defining the spacetimes (1), the corresponding mass is defined in terms of the dynamical exponent as\nm2 =\n\n2\u03bd(2\u03bd + D \u2212 1)\n,\nl2\n\n(11)\n\nand this will allow us to establish a correspondence between many of the gravity configurations we study and exact\nscalar massive modes propagating on these backgrounds.\nIII.\n\nSQUARE-CURVATURE CORRECTIONS IN ARBITRARY DIMENSIONS\n\nThe existence of an abundant Schr\u00f6dinger symmetric sector in higher-dimensional pure gravity becomes clear\nfrom the analysis of Ref. [15] where, besides their general arguments, an explicit example was worked out for a\nparticular five-dimensional quadratic modification to the Einstein-Hilbert action. Here, we provide explicitly the\ngeneral configurations for arbitrary dimension. In particular, this will lead us to observe the existence of special\ncritical points in the space of coupling constants at which logarithmic dependences that necessarily break Schr\u00f6dinger\nsymmetry appear. Such logarithmic falling-off that emerges at these special points potentially leads to the definition\nof weakened asymptotically AdS boundary conditions. The results of this section can be thought of as a higherdimensional generalization of the recent results of Ref. [24] for the three-dimensional parity-preserving massive gravity\nintroduced in Ref. [25].\nUnlike the three or four-dimensional cases, in higher dimensions, three different invariants have to be used to write\nthe most general quadratic action; namely\nZ\n\u0001\n\u221a\nS[g\u03bc\u03bd ] = dD x \u2212g R \u2212 2\u03bb + \u03b21 R2 + \u03b22 R\u03b1\u03b2 R\u03b1\u03b2 + \u03b23 R\u03b1\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd R\u03b1\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd .\n(12)\nHere, we denote the cosmological constant by \u03bb for reasons that will become clear later. The constants \u03b2i are the\ncoupling constants for the different curvature square modifications. The field equations obtained by varying the action\n(12) with respect to the metric read\nG\u03bc\u03bd + \u03bbg\u03bc\u03bd + (\u03b22 + 4\u03b23 ) \u0003R\u03bc\u03bd +\n\n1\n(4\u03b21 + \u03b22 ) g\u03bc\u03bd \u0003R \u2212 (2\u03b21 + \u03b22 + 2\u03b23 ) \u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bd R\n2\n\n+ 2\u03b23 R\u03bc\u03b3\u03b1\u03b2 R\u03bd\u03b3\u03b1\u03b2 + 2 (\u03b22 + 2\u03b23 ) R\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b2 R\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 4\u03b23 R\u03bc\u03b1 R\u03bd\u03b1 + 2\u03b21 RR\u03bc\u03bd\n\u2212\n\n\u0001\n1\n\u03b21 R2 + \u03b22 R\u03b1\u03b2 R\u03b1\u03b2 + \u03b23 R\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 R\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 g\u03bc\u03bd = 0.\n2\n\n(13)\n\nBefore deriving the different class of solutions, we first fix the cosmological constant \u03bb such that the AdS spacetime\nof radius l is a solution of the equations (13). By doing so, we find the following constraint between the cosmological\nconstant \u03bb, the AdS radius l, and the coupling constants \u03b2i\n\u03bb=\u2212\n\n(D \u2212 1)(D \u2212 2) (D \u2212 1)(D \u2212 4)\n+\n[(D \u2212 1) (D\u03b21 + \u03b22 ) + 2\u03b23 ] .\n2l2\n2l4\n\n(14)\n\n\u00bfFrom this, we notice that only in four dimensions the cosmological constant is related to the AdS radius in the usual\nway, without involving the couplings \u03b2i .\nWith the choice (14) for the cosmological constant, Einstein equations (13) for the AdS waves (9) yield the following\nequations (see details in the Appendix)\n\u001a\n\u0003\n\u0002\n(\u03b22 + 4\u03b23 ) r4 F \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032 \u2212 2(D \u2212 4)r3 F \u2032\u2032\u2032\n\u0003\n\u0002\n+ l2 \u2212 2D(D \u2212 1)\u03b21 + (D \u2212 2)(D \u2212 8)\u03b22 + 4(D \u2212 2)(D \u2212 5)\u03b23 r2 F \u2032\u2032\n\u001b\n\u0003 \u2032 \u03b4\u03bct \u03b4\u03bdt\n\u00022\n= 0.\n(15)\n\u2212(D \u2212 2) l \u2212 2D(D \u2212 1)\u03b21 \u2212 (3D \u2212 4)\u03b22 \u2212 8\u03b23 rF\n2l2 r2\n\n\f6\nIn what follows, we provide a detailed analysis of the equation (15) in order to survey the different solutions\nexhaustively.\nA.\n\nThe second order sector\n\nThe first case we will explore is the one for which the fourth-order differential equation (15) reduces to a second-order\nequation. This occurs for the special election \u03b22 = \u22124\u03b23 , yielding\n\u0003\u0002\n\u0003\n1 \u00022\nl \u2212 2D(D \u2212 1)\u03b21 + 12(D \u2212 2)\u03b23 r2 F \u2032\u2032 \u2212 (D \u2212 2)rF \u2032 = 0.\n2\nl\n\n(16)\n\nIt is clear from this equation that, if additionally one chooses \u03b21 = [l2 + 12(D \u2212 2)\u03b23 ]/[2D(D \u2212 1)], a full degeneracy\nappears and the field equations are satisfied for any profile F ; this degenerate class will be analyzed in details in\nSubsec. III D. Then, for \u03b21 6= [l2 + 12(D \u2212 2)\u03b23 ]/[2D(D \u2212 1)] the resulting equations are of second order as in the\nLovelock case [59]; actually, the Lovelock theory which corresponds to \u03b22 = \u22124\u03b23 and \u03b21 = \u03b23 , appears as a particular\ncase in this analysis. More precisely, for the above inequality (up to an additive constant that can be removed by\ncoordinate transformations) the solution is given by\nF (r) = c0 rD\u22121 ,\n\n(17)\n\nand coincides with the solution of General Relativity, i.e. the one with all the constants \u03b2i = 0. This solution can be\nthought of as the usual General Relativity exact massless scalar mode since the field equation (16) is proportional to\nthe wave equation\n\u0003F = 0.\n\n(18)\n\nIt is also interesting to note that the solution (17) preserves only the partial Schr\u00f6dinger symmetry and not the\nfull one. In the next subsection, we shall establish explicitly the existence of a higher order sector enjoying the full\nSchr\u00f6dinger symmetry.\nB.\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger invariant sector\n\nFor \u03b22 6= \u22124\u03b23 , the field equation (15) is a fourth-order Euler differential equation. In the generic case, the space of\nlinearly independent solutions is spanned in power-laws F \u221d r\u03b1 , where the exponents \u03b1 are the roots of the following\nfourth-degree characteristic polynomial\n\"\u0012\n#\n\u00132\nD\u22121\n(D \u2212 1)2\nl2 \u2212 2(D \u2212 1)(D\u03b21 + \u03b22 ) + 4(D \u2212 4)\u03b23\n\u03b1(\u03b1 \u2212 D + 1) \u03b1 \u2212\n\u2212\n= 0.\n(19)\n\u2212\n2\n4\n\u03b22 + 4\u03b23\nSince the constant solution, i.e. \u03b1 = 0, can be removed by coordinate transformations, the general solution is then\ngiven by\nF (r) = c0 rD\u22121 + c+ r\u03b1+ + c\u2212 r\u03b1\u2212 ,\n\n(20a)\n\nwhere\nD\u22121\n\u03b1\u00b1 =\n\u00b1\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n(D \u2212 1)2\n2(D \u2212 1)(D\u03b21 + \u03b22 ) \u2212 4(D \u2212 4)\u03b23 \u2212 l2\n+\n4\n\u03b22 + 4\u03b23\n\n\u00131/2\n\n,\n\n(20b)\n\nand where c0 and c\u00b1 are integrations constants. It is worth noticing that the solutions (20) generate an exact scalar\nmassive excitation (10) of mass\nm2 =\n\n2(D \u2212 1)(D\u03b21 + \u03b22 ) \u2212 4(D \u2212 4)\u03b23 \u2212 l2\n.\nl2 (\u03b22 + 4\u03b23 )\n\n(21)\n\nTo be more precise, the solution (20) describes the superposition of three exact scalar modes given by the massless\nmode of General Relativity (17) and two other modes generated by the squared modifications and both sharing the\nsame mass (21). It is worth pointing out that the solution (20) is valid only when the roots (20b) are real. This in\n\n\f7\nturn constraints the mass (21) to obey strictly the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound associated to the AdS space where\nthe waves are propagating on [60, 61]\nm2 > \u2212\n\n(D \u2212 1)2\n.\n4l2\n\n(22)\n\nIt is also easy to see that taking any pair of the integrations constants in (20) to zero, the isometry group of the\nresulting background gets enhanced to the partial Schr\u00f6dinger group. The full Schr\u00f6dinger isometry can only be\nachieved by choosing c0 = 0 and c+ = 0 while the coupling constants must be constrained by\n\u03b22 =\n\nD(D \u2212 1)\nl2\n\u03b21 \u2212 (3D \u2212 2)\u03b23 \u2212 ,\n2\n4\n\n(23)\n\nand this value corresponds to a mass (21) given by (see also (11) for \u03bd = 1)\nm2 =\n\nC.\n\n2(D + 1)\n.\nl2\n\n(24)\n\nThe Logarithmic sectors\n\nWe now turn to the cases for which the roots of the characteristic polynomial (19) may have some multiplicities.\nAs it is well-known, for multiple roots the power laws fail to span all the linearly independent solutions to Eq. (15)\nand additional behaviors exhibiting logarithmic dependence typically occur. The existence of such exact logarithmic\nbehaviors has been established for TMG in Refs. [17, 20]. Moreover, some of the logarithmic configurations of TMG\nhave been shown to be compatibles with some relaxed AdS asymptotic [32, 33] and define a sector of the theory\ncurrently known as the Log Gravity sector [62]; see also [63]. The relevance of this sector is that, in three dimensions,\nit may be holographically dual at the quantum level to a Logarithmic CFT [64\u201369]. We have shown in [24] that a\nsimilar exact Log sector exists also within the context of NMG.5\nThe first source of multiplicity appears when the roots (20b) become one single root, which occurs for\n\u0003\n\u0002\n4 l2 \u2212 2D(D \u2212 1)\u03b21 \u2212 (D2 \u2212 6D + 17)\u03b23\n,\n(25)\n\u03b22 =\n(D + 7)(D \u2212 1)\nand the related double multiplicity solution turns to be\nF (r) = c0 rD\u22121 + r\n\nD\u22121\n2\n\n(c1 ln r + c2 ) .\n\n(26)\n\nFor c1 = 0, two residual sectors having the partial Schr\u00f6dinger symmetry still remain, taking either c0 = 0 or c2 = 0.\nIn contrast, the full Schr\u00f6dinger symmetry is forbidden for all sectors of the solution.\nThe global interpretation of the solution (26) is also of interest. The configuration represents the superposition of\nthe massless mode of GR plus two additional exact scalar modes saturating the BF bound of the AdS space where\nthe waves are propagating on [60, 61], since the related profile satisfies\n\u0003F = m2BF F,\n\nm2BF \u2261 \u2212\n\n(D \u2212 1)2\n.\n4l2\n\n(27)\n\nNotice that this value for the mass is included in the range (21) with \u03b22 given by (25).\nThe other multiplicities may appear when one of the two generic roots (20b) either vanishes or takes the value\nD \u2212 1. In fact, these two possibilities occur simultaneously and in this case the coupling constants must be restricted\nas follows\n\u03b22 =\n\n5\n\nl2 \u2212 2D(D \u2212 1)\u03b21 + 4(D \u2212 4)\u03b23\n.\n2(D \u2212 1)\n\n(28)\n\nSee Refs. [70, 71] for the linearized case and Refs. [26, 27] for the case of other theories as bi-gravity and Born-Infeld gravity [28]. Log\ngravity was also studied in higher dimensions recently [72].\n\n\f8\nThe solution with simultaneous double multiplicity is then of the form\n\u0001\nF (r) = c0 rD\u22121 + c1 rD\u22121 + c2 ln r.\n\n(29)\n\nAt this point of the space of parameters there is no sector compatible with the partial Schr\u00f6dinger invariance except\nthe trivial mode of General Relativity, i.e. c1 = c2 = 0. In addition of being incompatible with the Schr\u00f6dinger\nsymmetry, the modes generated by these higher-curvature modifications can not be interpreted as exact scalar modes\nas they do not satisfy the Klein-Gordon equation.

III B the generic solution (20) is only valid for mass values above the BreitenlohnerFreedman bound [60, 61], which constraints the scalar modes propagating on AdS. However, the modes we consider\nhere are of gravitational nature and there are it a priori no reasons for which they must obey the celebrated BF\nbound. Hence, the sector having a mass below the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound (27),\nm2 < m2BF ,\n\n(31)\n\nmight be considered as well, as it has been done in [73] in the context of non-relativistic holographic correspondence.\nIn this case, the roots (20b) take complex conjugate values and the solution acquires the following oscillatory behavior\n\u0014\n\u0012q\n\u0013\n\u0012q\n\u0013\u0015\nD\u22121\nD\u22121\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nF (r) = c0 r\n+r\nc1 sin l mBF \u2212 m ln r + c2 cos l mBF \u2212 m ln r ,\n(32)\nwhere m2 is again given by Eq.

As it was previously mentioned, it is remarkable that when the coupling constants are tied in\nthe following manner\n\u03b21 =\n\nl2 + 12(D \u2212 2)\u03b23\n,\n2D(D \u2212 1)\n\n\u03b22 = \u22124\u03b23 ,\n\n(33)\n\nthe metrics (9) solves the equations of motion (13) for any wave profile F (r). In particular, solutions with full\nSchr\u00f6dinger symmetry are admitted in this case. The specific theories allowing this kind of degeneracy are described\nby the following Lagrangian\nR \u2212 2\u03bb + \u03b23 LGB +\n\nl2 \u2212 2(D \u2212 3)(D \u2212 4)\u03b23 2\nR ,\n2D(D \u2212 1)\n\n(34)\n\nwhere LGB = R2 \u2212 4R\u03b1\u03b2 R\u03b1\u03b2 + R\u03b1\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd R\u03b1\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd is the usual quadratic Gauss-Bonnet Lagrangian, and the cosmological\nconstant is fixed as\n\u0013\n\u0012\n(D \u2212 1)\n4(D \u2212 3)(D \u2212 4)\n\u03bb=\u2212\n(35)\nD\n\u2212\n\u03b2\n3 .\n4l2\nl2\nThere are two interesting cases included within this family of degenerate theories.

III A and the full Schr\u00f6dinger invariance is forbidden. It is interesting to note that the Lagrangian (36) is the\nprecise combination that allows the existence of Lifshitz black holes [74, 75] for the gravity theory with R2 \u2212corrections.\nIt is also remarkable that for such a fine-tuning of the coefficients, the Lagrangian, which adopts the f (R)-form, can\nnot be reduced to a scalar-tensor theory through the standard frame-changing trick [75].\nAnother interesting case occurs for\n\u03b23 =\nand in this case the Lagrangian becomes\nR \u2212 2\u03bb \u2212\n\nl2\n,\n2(D \u2212 3)(D \u2212 4)\n(D \u2212 1)(D \u2212 2)\nLGB .\n8(D \u2212 3)(D \u2212 4)\u03bb\n\n(37)\n\nThis last case includes the point of the space of parameters where the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity coincides with\nthe Chern-Simons gravity in D = 5 [76], that is \u03b21 = \u2212\u03b22 /4 = \u03b23 = \u22123/(4\u03bb). At this point, the theory exhibits local\ngauge invariance under the AdS group SO(4, 2). A particular feature of Chern-Simons (CS) gravity is that its space\nof solutions is highly degenerate, and thus it is not necessarily surprising that all the metrics (9) solve the equations\nof motion.6 It is worth pointing out that the degeneracy that appears at \u03b21 = \u2212\u03b22 /4 = \u03b23 = \u22123/(4\u03bb) in D = 5 is\nexactly what happens in the case c = 0 and a\u039b = 3/4 of Ref. [15] (see Eq. (2.25) therein), where degenerate solutions\narise.\nWe have confirmed by explicit calculation that a similar feature is found in arbitrary number of dimensions as long\nas one choose the coupling constants for the Lovelock Lagrangian to exhibit local gauge invariance. More precisely, if\none considers the theory defined by the action\nZ\n\n[ D\u22121\n2 ]\nn\nX\nY\n\u221a\n\u03b2n \u03bc1 \u03bd1\nD\n\u03bcn \u03bdn\nd x \u2212g\n\u03b4\n.\n.\n.\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\nR\u03c3r \u03c1r \u03bcr \u03bdr ,\n\u03c3\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n]\nn\n1\n[\u03c3\nn n!\nn\n1\n2\nn=0\nr=1\n\n(38)\n\nthere always exists a special choice of coupling constants \u03b21 , \u03b22 , \u03b23 , . . . , such that the above Lagrangian can be\nwritten as a Chern-Simons form in odd dimensions [76] and as a Pfaffian form in even dimensions. For the theories\ndefined with such fine tuning, it turns out that the metric (1) is admitted as solution for arbitrary \u03bd. In the language\nof [15] this would mean that, if such a precise tuning between coupling constants \u03b2i is considered, the dynamical\nexponent z = \u03bd + 1 does not get renormalized. Here, we point out that this non-renormalization is associated to the\nenhancement of local (AdS) symmetry at the Chern-Simons point. The question remains whether all the cases (33)\nexhibit enhancement of symmetry that permits to explain the non-renormalization of the dynamical exponent in a\nnatural way. To answer this question one has to be reminded of the fact that the enhancement of symmetry that\noccurs at the Chern-Simons point may also explain the existence of other degenerate points in the moduli space. That\nis, the Schr\u00f6dinger invariant backgrounds are such that changes in the values of \u03b2i may be absorbed in a redefinition\nof the parameters. In turn, the family of theories that admit solutions with arbitrary \u03bd would be parameterized by\nthose changes of the couplings \u03b2i that induce renormalization of l leaving \u03bd unchanged.\nIt is worth mentioning that the AdS wave-like solutions we found here also appear in other theories with highercurvature (and not only square-curvature) terms. A particular case is the family of theories considered in [78]. In the\nnext section we will consider another type of theories which consists of non-polynomial corrections of the invariants.\nIV.\n\nNON-POLYNOMIAL CORRECTIONS\n\nIn this section we will extend our previous results by considering a gravity theory including modifications that are\nmore general than the quadratic curvature terms discussed above. In fact, we will consider the most general action\ndepending on the three curvature invariants R, R\u03b1\u03b2 R\u03b1\u03b2 and R\u03b1\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd R\u03b1\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd , namely7\nZ\n\u0001i\n\u221a h\nS[g\u03bc\u03bd ] = dD x \u2212g R \u2212 2\u03bb\u0303 + f R, R\u03b1\u03b2 R\u03b1\u03b2 , R\u03b1\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd R\u03b1\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd ,\n(39)\n6\n7\n\nIn fact, a similar behavior occurs for statics configurations [77].\nIt can be seen that similar results are obtained if one allows for more general modifications, like Lagrangians with functions f (X) of\nother invariants like X = R\u03b1\u03bc\u03b2\u03bd R\u03b1\u03b2 R\u03bc\u03bd .\n\n\f10\nwhere f is a smooth function of the three quadratic curvature invariants.\nNow, let us denote the cosmological constant by \u03bb\u0303 to emphasize the difference with the previous case (12).

Notice that the\ncurvature invariants of an AdS-wave in any dimension are independent of the specific profile function F and thus are\nspecified by the AdS space constant invariants\nR=\u2212\n\nD(D \u2212 1)\n,\nl2\n\nR\u03b1\u03b2 R\u03b1\u03b2 =\n\nD(D \u2212 1)2\n,\nl4\n\nR\u03b1\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd R\u03b1\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd =\n\n2D(D \u2212 1)\n.\nl4\n\n(42)\n\nThis in turn implies that both the function f and its derivatives fi , i = 1, 2, 3, evaluated on AdS-waves solutions\n(conformally pp-waves) become constants denoted by\nf \u0303 \u2261 f |ds2\n\nAdS\n\n,\n\nf \u0303i \u2261 fi |ds2\n\nAdS\n\n.\n\n(43)\n\nThese two properties imply that the resulting equations coincide exactly with those of the square-modified gravity\n(13) with the following identifications\n\u03b21 =\n\nl2 f \u03031\nf \u03031\n=\u2212\n,\n2R\n2D(D \u2212 1)\n\n\u03b22 = f \u03032 ,\n\n\u03b23 = f \u03033 ,\n\n(44)\n\nwhile the cosmological constant is given by\n\u03bb = \u03bb\u0303 \u2212\n\n\u001a\ni\u001b\nf \u0303 D(D \u2212 1)  \u0303\n2 h\n \u0303\n \u0303\n.\n(D\n\u2212\n1)\nf\n+\n2\nf\nf\n\u2212\n\u2212\n2\n3\n1\n2\n4l2\nl2\n\n(45)\n\nThe relations above establish a correspondence between the configurations of square-modified gravity and those\nconsidered in (39). Starting from this observation, we can easily summarize some properties relative to this generic\ntheory of modified gravity. The first observation is that an AdS space of radius l is a vacuum configuration of the\ngeneralized modified gravity (39) if the cosmological constant is constrained to be\n\u001a\ni\u001b\n(D \u2212 1)(D \u2212 2) f \u0303 (D \u2212 1)  \u0303\n2 h\n \u0303\n \u0303\n\u03bb\u0303 = \u2212\n(46)\n+ +\nf1 \u2212 2 (D \u2212 1)f2 + 2f3 .\n2l2\n2\nl2\nl\nBeing the cosmological constant fixed by (46), we can continue our analysis following the lines of the previous section.\nFor example, the second-order sector of this theory is found for\n12(D \u2212 2)f \u03033\nf \u03031 6= \u22121 \u2212\n,\nl2\n\n8\n\nf \u03032 = \u22124f \u03033 ,\n\n(47)\n\nIt is also possible to consider gravity actions depending on invariants constructed with orther-kth derivatives of the curvature.

(41)], we obtain\n\u0001(D\u22124)/4\nDR\nC\u03b1\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd C \u03b1\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd\n,\n2(D \u2212 1)(D \u2212 2)\u03b1w\n\u0001(D\u22124)/4\nD\nC\u03b1\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd C \u03b1\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd\n,\n= \u2212\n2(D \u2212 2)\u03b1w\n\u0001(D\u22124)/4\nD\n=\nC\u03b1\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd C \u03b1\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd\n.\n8\u03b1w\n\nf1 =\nf2\nf3\n\n(56)\n\n\f12\nFor dimensions D > 4, the above scalars fi are proportional to a positive power of the square of the Weyl tensor. The\nrelated constants f \u0303 and f \u0303i , being obtained by evaluating the scalars in their AdS values (43), vanish since AdS space\nis conformally flat and hence the Weyl tensor vanishes identically. This means that, in what regards to the AdS-wave\nsolutions, the conformally invariant modification of Einstein gravity gives no correction for dimensions D > 4. This\ncase is described by the branch (47) and the resulting configuration is the one of General Relativity (17) which yields\nonly the partial Schr\u00f6dinger symmetry. In four dimensions the situation is quite different since the resulting theory\n(54)-(55) corresponds to the square-curvature corrections that we have considered in Sec. III with\n\u03b21 =\n\n1\n,\n6\u03b1w\n\n\u03b22 = \u2212\n\n1\n,\n\u03b1w\n\n\u03b23 =\n\n1\n.\n2\u03b1w\n\nAs a consequence, except for the second-order and degenerate sectors which require \u03b22 = \u22124\u03b23 , all the other sectors\nof solutions described in Sec. III are present for this four-dimensional Einstein-Weyl gravity theory.\nVI.\n\nPARITY-VIOLATING CHERN-SIMONS MODIFICATION\n\nNow, let us move to study another interesting example of gravitational model in four dimensions. This is the JackiwPi theory [34], usually referred to as the Chern-Simons modified gravity in four dimensions. This model is defined by\nsupplementing the Einstein-Hilbert action with a different (parity violating) quadratic term in the curvature, yielding\nthe total action\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n\u03b8\u2217\n\u03b1\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd\n4 \u221a\nR\u03b1\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd R\n.\n(57)\n\u015c[g\u03bc\u03bd ] = d x \u2212g R \u2212 2\u039b +\n4\nHere \u03b8 is a local Lagrange multiplier that couples to the Pontryagin density \u2217 R\u03b1\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd R\u03b1\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd , constructed via the\ndual curvature tensor \u2217 R\u03b1\u03b2 \u03bc\u03bd = 21 \u03b7 \u03c1\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd R\u03b1\u03b2\u03c1\u03c3 , where \u03b7\u03c1\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd is the volume 4-form.9 The coupling is such that \u03b8 has\ndimensions of [length]2 . Note that the action (57) has to be distinguished from the Chern-Simons gravitational theories\nof Ref. [76], which exist in odd dimensions and correspond to a particular case of Lovelock Lagrangian [59].\nThe inclusion of the non-dynamical field \u03b8 comes from the fact that the Pontryagin form \u2217 R\u03b1\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd R\u03b1\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd is a total\nderivative. As a consequence, the variation with respect to the metric brings an additional piece to the Einstein\nequations, which corresponds to a four-dimensional version of the Cotton tensor whose definition obviously depends\non \u03b8. Since the field \u03b8 can be fixed arbitrarily, the diffeomorphism invariance is broken. Nevertheless, the conservation\nof the equations of motion makes diffeomorphism symmetry to be restored dynamically. That is, the consistency of the\ntheory imposes that only geometries with vanishing Pontryagin form are allowed as solutions. The same conclusion\nis obtained by considering the non-dynamical field \u03b8 as a Lagrange multiplier; see Ref. [79] for a careful digression on\nthis point.\nThe equations of motion derived from the Jackiw-Pi action (57) then take the form\nC\u03bc\u03bd + G\u03bc\u03bd \u2212\n\n3\ng\u03bc\u03bd = 0,\nl2\n\n(58)\n\nwhere, as mentioned above, C\u03bc\u03bd is a sort of generalization of the three-dimensional Cotton tensor that appears in the\nequations of motion of TMG, given by10\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(59)\nC \u03bc\u03bd = \u2207\u03b1 \u2207\u03b2 \u03b8 \u2217 R\u03b1(\u03bc|\u03b2|\u03bd) .\nThe conservation of the Einstein equations yields the additional constraint\n\u2207\u03bc C\u03bc\u03bd =\n\n1\u2217\nR\u03b1\u03b2\u03c1\u03c3 R\u03b1\u03b2\u03c1\u03c3 \u2207\u03bd \u03b8 = 0,\n8\n\n(60)\n\nwhich imposes that all solutions of the Jackiw-Pi theory (57) must obey \u2217 R\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 R\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 = 0. It is worth noticing that all\nSiklos spacetimes, being AdS waves, satisfy this necessary condition as they have vanishing Pontryagin invariant. In\nfact, we have \u2217 C\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 C \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 = 0 which in turn implies that \u2217 R\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 R\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 = 0 since both invariants agree (for a detailed\n\n9\n10\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\nHere \u03b7t\u03berx = \u2212g (\u03b7t\u03berx = \u22121/ \u2212g).\nThere are other generalizations of the Cotton tensor in higher dimensions, see e.g. Ref. [80].\n\n\f13\nanalysis, see the first Appendix of Ref. [81]). This is a promising scenario for the search of Schr\u00f6dinger symmetric\nconfigurations. Indeed, we will now show that the Jackiw-Pi theory (57) admits solutions with Schr\u00f6dinger symmetry.\nIn order to realize this task, the first step is to make an \"educated\" choice for the breaking of diffeomorphism invariance\nby considering11\n\u03b8=\n\n1 x\n,\n\u03b1p r\n\n(61)\n\nwhere \u03b1p is a coupling constant with dimensions of [length]\u22122 . This choice reduces the variational Cotton-like tensor\n(59) to the single expression\nC\u03bc\u03bd\n\nr2\n=\u2212\n2\u03b1p l2\n\n\u0012\n\nF \u2032\u2032\nr\n\n\u0013\u2032\n\n\u03b4\u03bct \u03b4\u03bdt .\n\n(62)\n\nTaking all this into account, the Jackiw-Pi equations (58) become\nr2\n\u2212\n2\u03b1p l2\n\n\"\n\n1\nr1\u2212\u03b1p l\n\n2\n\n\u0012\n\nF\u2032\nr\u03b1p l\n\n2\n\n\u0013\u2032 #\u2032\n\n\u03b4\u03bct \u03b4\u03bdt = 0.\n\n(63)\n\nFor generic values of the coupling constant \u03b1p , with \u03b1p 6= \u22121/l2 and \u03b1p 6= 2/l2 , the solution of this equation is given\nby\n2\n\nF (r) = c0 r3 + c1 r1+\u03b1p l ,\n\n(64)\n\nwhere we have discarded the additive constant removable through a coordinate transformation. On the other hand,\nfor the critical values \u03b1p = \u22121/l2 and \u03b1p = 2/l2 , we obtain the following logarithmic branches\nF (r) = c0 r3 + c1 ln r,\nF (r) = c0 r3 + c1 r3 ln r,\n\n(65)\n(66)\n\nrespectively. Solutions (65) and (66) enjoy the partial Schr\u00f6dinger symmetry for c1 = 0 while the generic solution (64)\nis also partially Schr\u00f6dinger invariant as long as one of the two constants is set to zero. The analogy with the theories\nstudied previously is complete since the generic solution (64) have the full Schr\u00f6dinger symmetry for the special fine\ntuning\n\u03b1p = \u2212\n\n3\n.\nl2\n\nThere also exists a close relation to TMG: Identifying the three-dimensional topological mass in term of the fourdimensional coupling constant as \u03bc = \u03b1p l,12 both the generic solution (64) and the critical one (65) can be represented\nfor c0 = 0 as a warped product having as base the corresponding TMG configurations of Refs. [17\u201322] with a real line\nfiber generated by the spatial direction along the coordinate x; namely\nds2JP = ds2TMG +\n\nl2 2\ndx .\nr2\n\n(67)\n\nThe other critical solution (66) which corresponds to \u03b1p = 2/l2 , does not allow such a simple representation in\nterm of the remaining three-dimensional critical TMG solution with topological mass \u03bc = 1/l. However, since this\nthree-dimensional case turns out to be a consistent asymptotically AdS configuration in TMG despite its weakened\nlogarithmic decay [32, 33], it would be very interesting to check if the above critical solution (66) for \u03b1p = 2/l2 is\nalso an asymptotically AdS solution of the Jackiw-Pi theory, relaxing the standard asymptotic conditions known for\nGeneral Relativity [29].\n\n11\n12\n\nIt is possible to show that there exists an infinite family of elections compatible with the existence of Schr\u00f6dinger symmetry, and we are\njust presenting the simplest one.\nNotice we are using here the definition of the topological mass for example of Ref. [33]\n\n\f14\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper, we have been concerned with a special class of Siklos spacetimes that contains the Schr\u00f6dinger\ninvariant metrics as particular cases. Our main purpose was to identify pure gravity theories that exhibit solutions\nof this special kind. We began by considering the Einstein gravity augmented by square-curvature corrections in\narbitrary dimensions D. In this case, we have shown that for a particular choice of the coupling constants Schr\u00f6dinger\ninvariant metrics are allowed as solutions, while other choice yields to a sector of solutions with logarithmic falling-off.\nWe have also observed the existence of a degenerate sector whose space of solutions contains all these particular\nSiklos spacetimes, without restricting the profile function F that appears in the metric. We discussed the relation\nof this degeneracy to the non-renormalization of the dynamical exponent z = \u03bd + 1 observed at special points of\nthe moduli space. We further extended our results to a larger set of gravity theories, whose Lagrangians are given\nby arbitrary functions of the square-curvature invariants. This was achieved by establishing a correspondence with\nsquare-curvature models discussed first. All the sectors studied for the square-curvature actions were shown to also\nappear in this more general class of models. As a special example, we considered the theory defined by adding to the\nEinstein-Hilbert action non-polynomial conformally invariant corrections in arbitrary dimension D. In this case, we\nobserved that only in D = 4, which corresponds to a particular case of square-curvature action, this theory presents\ngenuinely new features, as for the case of higher dimensions the type of solution we discuss simply reduces to the\nsolutions of D-dimensional General Relativity. Finally, we have also analyzed a completely different higher-order\ntheory of gravity, the so-called Chern-Simons modification of four-dimensional General Relativity proposed by Jackiw\nand Pi. This model involves a non-dynamical field that plays the role of a Lagrange multiplier which forces the\nPontryagin density to vanish. We have shown that for some precise choices of the non-dynamical field, the parityviolating Chern-Simons modification of General Relativity exhibits both the Schr\u00f6dinger invariant and the logarithmic\nsectors as exact solutions.\nIn two recent papers, [75] and [82], we have shown that the Einstein gravity together with appropriated squarecurvature corrections in arbitrary dimensions D admits black holes configurations that asymptote the Lifshitz spacetimes [51]. A natural continuation of the work would be finding black holes with Schr\u00f6dinger asymptotic for (some of)\nthe higher order gravity theories considered in this paper. It would be interesting to obtain black hole configurations\nwhich asymptote the metrics (1) for arbitrary \u03bd 6= 1 and, consequently, to get black holes with partial Schr\u00f6dinger\nasymptotic. This question is of physical relevance as the black hole solutions that have been derived so far in the\ncontext of string theory and through the null Melvin twist (see [14] and [12]) possess the full Schr\u00f6dinger symmetry\nasymptotically by construction and hence correspond only to the class of solutions with \u03bd = 1. This prevents us from\nthe possibility to use an holographic description for the finite temperature effects of condensed matter systems having\n\u03bd 6= 1.\nFinally, let us conclude with few words about some classes of metrics that depends on time, and therefore the time\ntranslation is not longer an isometry, while the dilatation (3) or the special conformal transformations (4) still act as\nisometries [83]. A particular class of such metrics can be written in the following form\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013 2\nl2\nt\ndt\n2\n2\n2\nds = 2 \u2212G 1+\u03bd\n(68)\n+ 2dtd\u03be + dr + d~x ,\nr\nr\nr2\u03bd\nwhere G is an arbitrary function of the argument t/r1+\u03bd . In the sectors of solutions studied in this paper, the\nsolutions depend on arbitrary constants denoted by ci or c\u00b1 . However, it is easy to see that these constants can be\nreplaced by arbitrary functions of the time t. As a consequence, all the power law solutions derived previously of the\nform F (r) = c r\u03b1 can be extended to F (t, r) = c(t) r\u03b1 where c(t) is an arbitrary function of t. Therefore, choosing\n2\u03bd+\u03b1\nc(t) = c\u0303/t 1+\u03bd , where c\u0303 is a constant, makes the solution dilatation invariant for \u03bd 6= 1, while for \u03bd = 1 the solution\nadmits the special conformal transformation as isometry but not the dilatation.\nAcknowledgments\n\nConversations and correspondence with M.

It is worth noticing that the following formulae is valid even when\nthe profile has a more general dependence F = F (u, r, ~x). We use the null geodesic vector k \u03bc \u2202\u03bc = (r/l)\u2202\u03be that allows\nthe reinterpretation of these backgrounds as generalized Kerr-Schild transformations of AdS\nAdS\ng\u03bc\u03bd = g\u03bc\u03bd\n\u2212 F k\u03bc k\u03bd .\n\n(A1)\n\nWe start with the Ricci tensor, which for a D-dimensional AdS-wave is written as\nR\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212\n\n1\n(D \u2212 1)\ng\u03bc\u03bd + k\u03bc k\u03bd \u0003F,\n2\nl\n2\n\n(A2)\n\nyielding the scalar curvature R = \u2212D(D \u2212 1)/l2 , exactly the same as for AdS space.
