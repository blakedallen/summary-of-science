More experiments on B physics have been\nplanned in the present and future B factories [2]. Theoretical efforts to improve predictions\nand reduce uncertainties are expected and needed. It is well-known that mixing in neutral B\nmeson systems provides a good place to examine CP violation as well as flavor physics in the\nstandard model and beyond. For example, the mass difference between the mass eigenstates\nof neutral Bd meson, \u2206MBd , gives an important constraint on CKM matrix element Vtd and\nthe first indication of large mass of top quark. Similarly, the mass difference between the\nmass eigenstates of neutral Bs meson, \u2206MBs , which will be precisely measured in the near\nfuture would give an valuable constraint on CKM matrix element Vts . The another important\nobservable for mixing in neutral B meson systems is the lifetime difference between the mass\neigenstates of neutral B mesons, \u2206\u0393Bd or \u2206\u0393Bs . The ratio |Vts /Vtd |2 can be extracted from\nthe measurement of \u2206\u0393Bs [3]. The width difference of Bd mesons is CKM suppressed and\nconsequently not easy to be observed. In contrast, for Bs mesons the width difference is large\nenough to be measured [4] and has been recently measured [5] with low statistics. Hopefully,\nit will be measured with high statistics in the near future.\nAs usual, The light BsL and heavy BsH mass eigenstates are defined by\n|BsL,H i = p|Bs0 i \u00b1 q|B\u0304s0 i,\nwhere |Bs0 i and |B\u0304s0 i are the flavor eigenstates. The mass difference and the width difference\nbetween the physical states are given by\n\u2206m \u2261 MH \u2212 ML , \u2206\u0393 \u2261 \u0393H \u2212 \u0393L .\nBecause |\u039312 | \u226a |M12 | for Bs mesons [6], to the leading order in |\u039312 /M12 |, \u2206mB = 2|M12 |, \u2206\u0393B =\n2R(M12 \u0393\u221712 )/|M12 |. Neglecting very small CP violating corrections, the width difference for Bs\nmesons in SM has been given [6, 7]\n\u0012\n\n\u2206\u0393\n\u0393\n\n\u0013\n\nBs\n\n=\n\nfBs\n210 MeV\n\n!2\n\n[0.006 B(mb) + 0.150 BS (mb ) \u2212 0.063] ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere fBs is the decay constant of Bs , B and BS are the bag parameters related to the four\nquark operators OL and OS (see below). These hadronic quantities need to be calculated by\nnon perturbative methods such as lattice, QCD sum rules, Bethe-Salpeter approach, etc.\nThe similar quantities related to Bd0 \u2212 B\u0304d0 mixing have been estimated by Narison et al within\nthe traditional QCD sum rules approach[8] at \u03b1s order. Their conclusion is that the vacuum\nsaturation values BB \u2243 BB\u2217 \u2243 1 are satisfied within 15%. Their sum rules are constructed\nthrough two-point correlation functions and depend on some phenomenological assumptions.\nIn this letter we shall calculate the matrix elements of four-quark operators relevant to the Bs\nmeson lifetime difference through QCD sum rules in HQET. The sum rules are constructed with\nthree-point correlation functions. Our calculation is carried out at the leading order in 1/mb\nexpansion in HQET for simplicity. In ref.[8] the effects of condensates are absorbed like other\nfactorizable corrections into the contribution to fB and the available result of [9](though not\n1\n\n\fexplictily said) has been used as the effects are small compared to the perturbative corrections.\nIn our sum rules the nonperturbative contributions of condensates are explicitily included and\nthe numerical results confirm the smallness of these corrections (see below).\n\n2\n\nTheoretical formalism\n\nWe employ the following three-point Green's function,\n\u0393O (\u03c9, \u03c9 \u2032) = i2\n\nZ\n\n\u2032\n\n(b)\ndxdyeik *x+ik*y h0|T [s\u0304(x)\u03b35 h(b)\nv (x)]OL,S (0)[s\u0304(y)\u03b35 hv (y)]|0i ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c9 = v * k, \u03c9 \u2032 = v * k \u2032 ; hv(b) is the b-quark field in the HQET with velocity v. And OL,S\ndenotes the color-singlet four quark operators. They are\nOL = b\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )sb\u0304\u03b3\u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )s,\n\n(3)\n\nOS = b\u0304(1 \u2212 \u03b35 )sb\u0304(1 \u2212 \u03b35 )s,\n\n(4)\n\nIn terms of the hadronic expression, the correlator in Eq. (2) reads\n\u0393O (\u03c9, \u03c9 \u2032) =\n\nFB2 s hB\u0304s |QL,S |Bs i\n+ resonances ,\n4 (\u039b\u0304 \u2212 \u03c9)(\u039b\u0304 \u2212 \u03c9 \u2032)\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u039b\u0304 = mB \u2212 mb and FBs is the Bs decay constant in the leading order of heavy quark\nexpansion defined as \u2217\n\u221a\nh0|s\u0304(0)\u03b35 h(b)\nv (0)|Bs i = \u2212i mQ FBs\n\n(7)\n\nIn order to eliminate the contribution from the non-diagonal single pole terms and suppress\nthe continuum contribution in Eq. (5), we make double Borel transformation to the correlator.\nThe transformation is defined as\nB\u0302 =\n\nlim\n\u2212\u03c9 \u2192 \u221e\nn\u2192\u221e\nfixed\n\u03c4\u0303 \u2261 \u2212\u03c9\nn\n\nlim\n\u2212\u03c9 \u2032 \u2192 \u221e\nm\u2192\u221e\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03c4\u0303 \u2261 \u2212\u03c9\nfixed\nm\n\n(\u2212\u03c9)n+1\nn!\n\nd\nd\u03c9\n\n!n\n\n(\u2212\u03c9 \u2032 )m+1\nm!\n\nd\nd\u03c9 \u2032\n\n!m\n\n.\n\n(8)\n\nThere are two Borel parameters \u03c4\u0303 and \u03c4\u0303 \u2032 , which appear symmetrically, so \u03c4\u0303 = \u03c4\u0303 \u2032 = 2T are\ntaken in the following analysis.\nOn the other hand the correlator can be calculated at the quark gluon level. For example\nfor OL we may rewrite the right hand side of Eq. (2) as\n\u2217\n\nNote that fBs in Eq. (1) is defined by\nh0 | s\u0304 \u03b3 \u03bc \u03b35 b |Bs0 i = \u2212ifBs p\u03bc\n\n2\n\n(6)\n\n\f\u22122\n\nZ\n\ndxdyeik *x+ik*y {\u2212Tr[\u03b35 * iSbmi (x) * \u03b3 \u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03b35 ) * iSsin (\u2212y) * \u03b35 iSbnj (y) * \u03b3\u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03b35 ) * iSsjm (\u2212x)]\n\u2032\n\n+Tr[iSsim (\u2212x)] * \u03b35 * iSbmi (x) * \u03b3 \u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )]Tr[iSsjn (\u2212y)] * \u03b35 * iSbnj (y) * \u03b3\u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )]} (9)\n\nwhere iSsjn (x) is the full strange quark propagator with both perturbative term and condensates,\ni, j etc is the color index. iSbnj (x) is the leading order heavy quark propagator which has very\nsimple form in coordinate space:\niSbij (x) = \u03b4 ij\n\n\u221e\n\nZ\n\ndt\u03b4(x \u2212 vt)\n\n0\n\n(10)\n\nNote the structure of color flow is quite different for the two terms in Eq. (9). For the\nperturbative part the first and second term is proportional to Nc and Nc2 , respectively, where\nNc = 3 is the QCD color number. In the limit of Nc \u2192 \u221e, the second term dominates! As\nshown below, the non-factorizable contribution in Fig. 1 d, f and g has different color structure\nfrom the factorizable terms in Fig. 1a, b, c and e.

(18), (19) the terms with color factor Nc (Nc + 1) and\nNc (2Nc \u2212 1) come from the factorizable diagrams in Fig. 1 a, b, c and e. The non-factorizable\n2\ncontribution has a color factor Nc2\u22121 which comes from the summation over color factor,\n2\na a\nTr[ \u03bb2 \u03bb2 ] = Nc2\u22121 , in Fig. 1 d, f and g. A second observation is that the factorizable terms\nare all positive while nonfactorizable pieces are negative.\nNow we turn to the numerical analysis. The decay constant and binding energy of the Bs\nmeson at the leading order of heavy quark expansion can be obtained from the mass sum rule\n[13].\n!\nZ s0\n3\nm20\n\u039b\u0304\n2\n= 2\n)\n(20)\ndss(s + 2ms )e\u2212s/M \u2212 < s\u0304s > (1 \u2212\nFBs exp \u22122\nM\n8\u03c0 0\n4M 2\nZ\n\n4\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\fNote M = 2T, s0 = 2\u03c9c . We have not included \u03b1s corrections in Eq. (20), because they are\nalso neglected in the sum rule for hB\u0304s |OL,S |Bs i (18)-(19). The values of the parameters are\ncalculated to be FBs = (0.49 \u00b1 0.1) GeV3/2 , \u039b\u0304 = (0.68 \u00b1 0.1)GeV with the threshold s0 to be\n(2.2 \u00b1 0.3)GeV and the Borel parameter M in the window (0.65 \u2212 1.05) GeV [13]. Numerically\nwe use the following values of the condensates,\nhs\u0304si\n\u2243 \u22120.8 \u00d7 (0.23 GeV)3 ,\n2 2\nhgs G i\n\u2243 0.48 GeV4 ,\nhgs\u0304\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd G\u03bc\u03bd si \u2261 m20 hs\u0304si ,\nm20 \u2243 0.8 GeV2 .\n\n(21)\n\nFor the strange quark mass we use ms = 0.15 GeV.\nIn order to minimize the dependence of the parameters we divide Eqs. (18, 19) by Eq. (20)\nto extract the matrix elements, the variation of which with \u03c9c and T are given in Fig. 2 and 3.\nThe sum rule window is T = (0.2 \u2212 0.5) GeV, which is almost the same as that in the two-point\ncorrelator sum rule. We obtain\nhB\u0304s |OL |Bs i = (0.85 \u00b1 0.20)GeV4 ,\n\n(22)\n\n|hB\u0304s |OS |Bs i| = (0.55 \u00b1 0.15)GeV4\n\n(23)\n\nwhere the central value corresponds to T = 0.3GeV and \u03c9c = 1.1GeV. The uncertainty includes\nthe variation with T and \u03c9c . The bag parameters B and BS are defined by\nMB2 s\n8\n5\nhB\u0304s |OL |Bs i = fB2 s MB2 s B, hB\u0304s |OS |Bs i = \u2212 fB2 s MB2 s\nBS .\n3\n3\n(m\u0304b + m\u0304s )2\n\n(24)\n\nand they can be directly obtained from Eqs. (22), (23) and (24).\nThe ratio of these two matrix elements is very interesting. We divide Eq. (19) by Eq. (18)\nto extract the numerical value of the ratio. In such a way the dependence on the the Borel\nparameter and the continuum threshold is minimized as can be clearly seen in Fig. 4. Within\nthe accuracy of QSR the curve in Fig. 4 is flat. The ratio is practically the same in the working\nregion of T and \u03c9c . It reads\nR=\n\n|hB\u0304s |OS |Bs i|\n= (0.63 \u00b1 0.13)\nhB\u0304s |OL |Bs i\n\n(25)\n\nIn our numerical calculation, the contribution of the perturbative term is about 45 \u2212 65% of\nthe total contributions in preferred Borel variable region. We have used factorization approximation for the four quark condensates in numerical calculations. This may introduce some\nuncertainty. We may introduce a scale factor \u03ba to indicate the deviation from the factorization\napproximation as in [14]. In our calculations of sum rules the 1/Mb corrections in HQET have\nnot been included in , which may bring a deviation from the numerical results of the matrix\nelements. However, for the ratio of the two matrix elements, we expect little change to the\nabove analysis. Our numerical results are not sensitive to the mass of the strange quark. Actually, the effects due to the strange quark are very small so that the results for Bs are almost\nthe same as those for Bd .\n5\n\n\fWe now give a remark on the usual factorization assumption. In our Feynman diagram\n(Fig. 1) calculations, the contributions of nonfactorizable diagrams are around \u22126%, \u22127% for\nhB\u0304s |OS |Bs i and hB\u0304s |OL |Bs i respectively, which means that the factorization approach works\nwell even though our calculations are limited to the leading order in the 1/mb expansion in\nHQET. That is, the conclusion in Ref.[8] remains unchanged when the nonperturbative condensate contributions are taken into account. If one considers \u03b1s corrections, there is only\none nonfactorizable perturbative diagram, in which the gluon line in Fig. 1 f is connected,\nin the fixed-point gauge in the leading of 1/Mb expansion. However, radiative corrections are\ngenerally of high order \u03b1\u03c0s compared to the leading order, and the fact is that the perturbative\nterm is about 45 \u2212 65% to the whole contribution, so the contribution from the diagram can\nbe neglected compared to those in Fig. 1 (d), (f) and (g). The case here is different with that\nin the calculation of matrix elements of four-quark operators, relevant to the life time difference between heavy mesons, where the flavor changes \u2206F = 0. In that case, the perturbative\ncontribution vanishes[15], and we can't predict naively how large the radiative correction is\ncompared to the nonperturbative terms.\n\n5\n\nThe Bs and B\u0304s decay width difference\n\nThe complete expression for \u2206\u0393Bs with short-distance coefficients at NLO in QCD is given by\n[7]\n16\u03c0 2 B(Bs \u2192 Xe\u03bd) fB2 s MBs\n|Vcs |2 *\n3\ng(z)\u03b7\u0303\nm\nBs\nQCD\nb\n!\n2\n\u221a\nMBs\n5\n8\nBS + 1 \u2212 4z \u03b41/m ,\n* G(z) B + GS (z)\n3\n(m\u0304b + m\u0304s )2 3\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2206\u0393\n\u0393\n\n\u0013\n\n(26)\n\n=\n\nwhere\nG(z) = F (z) + P (z) and GS (z) = \u2212(FS (z) + PS (z)).\n\n(27)\n\nand F, P, FS , PS can be found in Ref. [7]. We eliminated the total decay rate \u0393Bs in favor of\nthe semileptonic branching ratio B(Bs \u2192 Xe\u03bd), as done in [6]. This cancels the dependence of\n(\u2206\u0393/\u0393) on Vcb and introduces the phase space function\ng(z) = 1 \u2212 8z + 8z 3 \u2212 z 4 \u2212 12z 2 ln z,\n\n(28)\n\nas well as the QCD correction factor [16]\n\u03b7\u0303QCD\n\n2\u03b1s (mb )\n=1\u2212\n3\u03c0\n\n\u221a\n31\n3\n\u03c0 \u2212\n(1 \u2212 z)2 +\n.\n4\n2\n\n\u0014\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n2\n\n\u0015\n\n(29)\n\nOne can also express the width difference as\n\u2206\u0393Bs\n=\n\u0393Bs\n\nmBs\n\u03c4Bs \u2206mBd\nmBd\n\n!(exp.)\n\nVts 2\nK * G(z) \u2212 GS (z)R(mb ) + \u03b4\u03031/m \u03be 2 ,\nVtd\n\u0012\n\n6\n\n\u0013\n\n(30)\n\n\fwhere\n\u03be=\n\nq\n\nfBs B\u0302Bs\nq\n\n,\n\n(31)\n\nfBd B\u0302Bd\nK is the Eq. (7) in ref. [17],\n\u03b4\u03031/m = fB2 s MB2 s \u03b41/m ,\n\n(32)\n\nand the \u03b4\u03031/m represents the 1/mb corrections and can be found in Ref. [6].\nIt is clear from the above equation that besides the ratio R of the matrix elements of four\nquark operators, which are those we have calculated in the paper, we only use the experimental\nBd -meson mass difference, which is known with a tiny error [18]\n(\u2206mBd )(exp.) = 0.484(15) ps\u22121 ,\n\n(33)\n\nand another ratio of hadronic matrix elements, \u03be, which is rather accurately determined in\nlattice simulations [19, 20].\nAs it is well known, the quantities in Eq. 1 are calculated at the scale O(mb ), while our\nresult Eq. (25) is calculated at the hadron scale \u03bchad . Therefore, We have to consider the\nrenormalization scale dependence of those four-quark operators. The anomalous dimension\nmatrix of these operators has been given in Ref. [7]. Using the anomalous dimension matrix\nand following the standard way, we obtain the scale dependence of R\nR(mb ) = 1.69R(\u03bchad ) + 0.03.\n\n(34)\n\nwhere R(\u03bchad ) is defined by Eq. (25). To obtain the numerical result, mb = 4.8 GeV and\n\u03bchad = 1.0 GeV have been used. It is obvious from Eq. (34) that the result depends on the\nrenormalization scale heavily.\nNumerically we have\n\u2206\u0393Bs\n\u0393Bs\n\n= [(0.5 \u00b1 0.1) + (13.8 \u00b1 2.8)R(mb ) + (15.7 \u00b1 2.8)(\u22120.55 \u00b1 0.17)] \u00d7 10\u22122\n= (7.0 \u00b1 0.8) \u00d7 10\u22122\n\n(35)\n\nClearly such a life time difference is compatible with existed literatures. It's interesting to\nBs\n= (10.7 \u00b1 2.6 \u00b1 1.4 \u00b1 1.7) \u00d7\ncompare our result to the two recent lattice QCD calculation: \u2206\u0393\n\u0393B\ns\n\n10\u22122 in Ref. [21] and\n\n\u2206\u0393Bs\n\u0393Bs\n\n= (4.7 \u00b1 1.5 \u00b1 1.6) \u00d7 10\u22122 in Ref. [17]. In Eq. (35) the numerical\n\nvalue of \u03b4\u03031/m , which corresponds to the 1/mb correction in the short distance expansion of the\noperator product Hef f (x)Hef f (0) [7], has been taken as -0.55[17]. If it is taken as -0.30, one has\n\u2206\u0393/\u0393 = 10.9 \u00d7 10\u22122 , larger than 7.0 \u00d7 10\u22122 , while in the case of Ref. [17], \u2206\u0393/\u0393 would remain\nin the 10% range with the change from -0.55 to -0.30. That is, the sensitivity to the final term\nin Eq. (35), i.e., the 1/mb correction, increases in our result. Without a good control of the\ncorrection, a precise determination of the lifetime difference is impossible.\n7\n\n\f6\n\nConclusion and discussion\n\nIn summary we have calculated the matrix elements of the four-quark operators relevant to\nthe Bs meson lifetime difference in QCD sum rules in HQET. The sum rules are constructed\nwith three-point correlators and both the perturbative and nonperturbative contribution are\ntaken into account. Our result shows that the usual factorization assumption is indeed a\ngood approximation. The numerical results show that the sum rules of those operators have\na good platform. The perturbative contribution to sum rules are about 45 \u2212 65% of the total\nBs\ncontribution. Our results are not sensitive to ms . The life difference \u2206\u0393\nis found to be around\n\u0393Bs\n(7.0 \u00b1 0.8) \u00d7 10\u22122 . This result is compatible with those predicted by lattice calculations. The\n\u03b1s corrections have not been taken into account in the sum rules and they will definitely have\neffects on the resulting numerical values. To get more accurate prediction, the \u03b1s corrections\nshould be taken into account, which is beyond the content of the letter.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe work was partly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China.\n\nReferences\n[1] Plenary talks presented by D.
