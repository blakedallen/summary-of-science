We show that apart from the class of channels which are unitarily equivalent to the channels with additive classical noise, these maps can be characterized\nin terms of weak- and/or anti-degradability. Furthermore a new set of channels\nwhich have null quantum capacity is identified. This is done by exploiting the\ncomposition rules of one-mode Gaussian maps and the fact that anti-degradable\nchannels can not be used to transfer quantum information.\n\nWithin the context of quantum information theory [1] Bosonic Gaussian channels [2,\n3, 4] play a fundamental role. They include all the physical transformations which\npreserve \"Gaussian character\" of the transmitted signals and can be seen are the quantum\ncounterpart of the Gaussian channels in the classical information theory [5]. Bosonic\nGaussian channels describe most of the noise sources which are routinely encountered in\noptics, including those responsible for the attenuation and/or the amplification of signals\nThe Leverhulme Visiting Professor at Centre for Quantum Computation, Department of Applied\nMathematics and Theoretical Physics, Cambridge University.\n\u2217\n\n1\n\n\falong optical fibers. Moreover, due to their relatively simple structure, these channels\nprovide an ideal theoretical playground for the study of continuous variable [6] quantum\ncommunication protocols.\nNot surprisingly in the recent years an impressive effort has been put forward to\ncharacterize the properties of Bosonic Gaussian channels. Most of the efforts focused on\nthe evaluation of the optimal transmission rates of these maps under the constraint on\nthe input average energy both in the multi-mode scenario (where the channel acts on a\ncollection of many input Bosonic mode) and in the one-mode scenario (where, instead,\nit operates on a single input Bosonic mode). In few cases [7, 8, 9, 10] the exact values of\nthe communication capacities [11, 12, 13] of the channels have been computed. In the\ngeneral case however only certain bounds are available (see [3, 10, 14, 15, 16]). Finally\nvarious additivity issues has been analyzed in Refs. [17, 18].\nRecently the notions of anti-degradability and weak-degradability were proposed as\nan useful tool for studying the quantum capacity properties of one-mode Gaussian channels [19]. This suggested the possibility of classifying these maps in terms of a simple\ncanonical form which was achieved in Ref. [20]. Moreover, proceeding along similar lines,\nthe exact solution of the quantum capacity of an important subset of those channels was\nobtained in Ref. [21].\nIn this paper we provide a complete degradability classification of one-mode Gaussian\nchannels and exhibit a new set of channels which have null quantum capacity extending\na previous result in Ref. [3].\nThe definition of weak- and anti-degradability of a quantum channel is similar to the\ndefinition of degradability introduced by Devetak and Shor in Ref. [22]. It is based on\nreplacing the Stinespring dilation [23] of the channel with a representation where the\nancillary system (environment) is not necessarily in a pure state [2, 24]. This yields a\ngeneralization of the notion of complementary channel from Ref. [22, 25, 26] which is\nnamed weakly complementary [19]. In this context weakly degradable are those channels\nwhere the modified state of the ancillary system \u2013 described by the action of the weakly\ncomplementary channel \u2013 can be recovered from the output state of the channel through\nthe action of a third channel. Vice-versa anti-degradable channels obey the opposite\nrule (i.e. the output state of the channel can be obtained from the modified state of\nthe ancilla through the action of another suitable channel). Exploiting the canonical\nform [20] one can show that, apart from the class B2 consisting of the maps which are\nunitarily equivalent to the channels with additive classical Gaussian noise [3], all onemode Bosonic Gaussian channels are either weakly degradable or anti-degradable. As\ndiscussed in Ref. [19] the anti-degradability property allows one to simplify the analysis\nof the quantum capacity [13] of these channels. Indeed those maps which are antidegradable can be shown to have null quantum capacity. On the other hand, those\n2\n\n\fchannels which are weakly degradable with pure ancillas (i.e. those which are degradable\nin the sense of Ref. [22]) have quantum capacity which can be expressed in terms of a\nsingle-letter expression. Here we will focus mostly on the anti-degradability property,\nand, additionally, we will show that by exploiting the composition rules of one-mode\nBosonic Gaussian channels, one can extend the set the maps with null quantum capacity\nwell beyond the set of anti-degradable maps.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 1 we introduce the notion of weakly\ncomplementarity and weak-degradability in a rather general context. In Sec. 2 we give\na detailed description of the canonical decomposition of one-mode Bosonic Gaussian\nchannels. In Sec. 3 we discuss the weak-degradability properties of one-mode channels.\nFinally, in Sec 4 we determine the new set of channels with null quantum capacity.\n\n1\n\nWeakly complementary and weakly degradable channels\n\nIn quantum mechanics, quantum channels describe evolution of an open system A\ninteracting with external degrees of freedom. In the Sch\u00f6dinger picture these transformations are described by completely positive trace preserving (CPT) linear maps \u03a6 acting\non the set D(Ha ) of the density matrices \u03c1a of the system. It is a well known (see e.g.\n[2], [24]) that \u03a6 can be described by a unitary coupling between the system A in input\nstate \u03c1a with an external ancillary system B (describing the environment) prepared in\nsome fixed pure state. This follows from Stinespring dilation [23] of the map which is\nunique up to a partial isometry. More generally, one can describe \u03a6 as a coupling with\nenvironment prepared in some mixed state \u03c1b , i.e.\n\u2020\n\u03a6(\u03c1a ) = Trb [Uab (\u03c1a \u2297 \u03c1b )Uab\n],\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere Trb [...] is the partial trace over the environment B, Uab is a unitary operator in\nthe composite Hilbert space Ha \u2297 Hb . We call Eq. (1.1) a \"physical representation\" of\n\u03a6 to distinguish it from the Stinespring dilation, and to stress its connection with the\nphysical picture of the noisy evolution represented by \u03a6. Any Stinespring dilation gives\nrise to a physical representation. Moreover from any physical representation (1.1) one\ncan construct a Stinespring dilation by purifying \u03c1b with an external ancillary system C,\nand by replacing Uab with the unitary coupling Uabc = Uab \u2297 11c .\nEquation (1.1) motivates the following [19]\n\n3\n\n\fDefinition 1 For any physical representation (1.1) of the quantum channel \u03a6 we define\nits weakly complementary as the map \u03a6\u0303 : D(Ha ) \u2192 D(Hb ) which takes the input state\n\u03c1a into the state of the environment B after the interaction with A, i.e.\n\u2020\n\u03a6\u0303(\u03c1a ) = Tra [Uab (\u03c1a \u2297 \u03c1b )Uab\n].\n\n(1.2)\n\nThe transformation (1.2) is CPT, and it describes a quantum channel connecting systems\nA and B. It is a generalization of the complementary (conjugate) channel \u03a6com defined\nin Ref. [22, 25, 26]. In particular, if Eq. (1.1) arises from a Stinespring dilation (i.e. if\n\u03c1b of Eq. (1.2) is pure) the map \u03a6\u0303 coincides with \u03a6com . Hence the latter is a particular\ninstance of a weakly complementary channel of \u03a6. On the other hand, by using the\nabove purification procedure, we can always represent a weakly complementary map as\na composition\n\u03a6\u0303 = T \u25e6 \u03a6com ,\n(1.3)\n\nwhere T is the partial trace over the purifying system (here \" \u25e6 \" denotes the composition\nof channels). As we will see, the properties of weakly complementary and complementary\nmaps in general differ.\nDefinition 2 Let \u03a6, \u03a6\u0303 be a pair of mutually weakly-complementary channels such that\n(\u03a8 \u25e6 \u03a6)(\u03c1a ) = \u03a6\u0303(\u03c1a ) ,\n\n(1.4)\n\nfor some channel \u03a8 : D(Ha ) \u2192 D(Hb ) and all density matrix \u03c1a \u2208 D(Ha ). Then \u03a6 is\ncalled weakly-degradable while \u03a6\u0303 \u2013 anti-degradable (cf. [19]).\nSimilarly if\n(\u03a8 \u25e6 \u03a6\u0303)(\u03c1a ) = \u03a6(\u03c1a ) ,\n\n(1.5)\n\nfor some channel \u03a8 : D(Hb ) \u2192 D(Ha ) and all density matrix \u03c1a \u2208 D(Ha ), then \u03a6 is\nanti-degradable while \u03a6\u0303 is weakly-degradable.\nIn Ref. [22] the channel \u03a6 is called degradable if in Eq. (1.4) we replace \u03a6\u0303 with a\ncomplementary map \u03a6com of \u03a6. Clearly any degradable channel [22] is weakly degradable\nbut the opposite is not necessarily true. Notice, however, that due to Eq. (1.3), in the\ndefinition of anti-degradable channel we can always replace weakly complementary with\ncomplementary (for this reason there is no point in introducing the notion of weakly\nanti-degradable channel). This allows us to verify that if \u03a6 is anti-degradable (1.5)\nthen its complementary channel \u03a6com is degradable [22] and vice-versa. It is also worth\npointing out that channels which are unitarily equivalent to a channel \u03a6 which is weakly\ndegradable (anti-degradable) are also weakly degradable (anti-degradable).\n4\n\n\fFinally an important property of anti-degradable channels is the fact that their quantum capacity [13] is null. As discussed in [19] this is a consequence of the no-cloning theorem [27] (more precisely, of the impossibility of cloning with arbitrary high fidelity [28]).\nIt is useful also to reformulate our definitions in the Heisenberg picture. Here the\nstates of the system are kept fixed and the transformation induced on the system by the\nchannel is described by means of a linear map \u03a6H acting on the algebra B(Ha ) of all\nbounded operators of A so that\nTra [\u03a6(\u03c1a ) \u0398a ] = Tra [\u03c1a \u03a6H (\u0398a )] ,\n\n(1.6)\n\nfor all \u03c1a \u2208 D(Ha ) and for all \u0398a \u2208 B(Ha ). From this it follows that the Heisenberg\npicture counterpart of the physical representation (1.1) is given by the unital channel\n\u0002 \u2020\n\u0003\n\u03a6H (\u0398a ) = Trb Uab\n(\u0398a \u2297 11b ) Uab (11a \u2297 \u03c1b ) .\n(1.7)\n\nSimilarly, from (1.2) it follows that in the Heisenberg picture the weakly complementary\nof the channel is described by the completely positive unital map\n\u0002 \u2020\n\u0003\n\u03a6\u0303H (\u0398b ) = Trb Uab\n(11a \u2297 \u0398b ) Uab 11a \u2297 \u03c1b ) ,\n(1.8)\nwhich takes bounded operators in Hb into bounded operators in Ha .\nWithin this framework the weak-degradability property (1.4) of the channel \u03a6H requires the existence of a channel \u03a8H taking bounded operators of Hb into bounded\noperators of Ha , such that\n(\u03a6H \u25e6 \u03a8H )(\u0398b ) = \u03a6\u0303H (\u0398b ) ,\n\n(1.9)\n\nfor all \u0398b \u2208 B(Hb ). Similarly we say that a quantum channel \u03a6H is anti-degradable, if\nthere exists a channel \u03a8H from B(Ha ) to B(Hb ), such that\n(\u03a6\u0303H \u25e6 \u03a8H )(\u0398a ) = \u03a6H (\u0398a ) ,\n\n(1.10)\n\nfor all \u0398a \u2208 B(Ha ).\n\n2\n\nOne-mode Bosonic Gaussian channels\n\nGaussian channels arise from linear dynamics of open Bosonic system interacting with\nGaussian environment via quadratic Hamiltonians. Loosely speaking, they can be characterized as CPT maps that transform Gaussian states into Gaussian states [3, 4, 29].\n5\n\n\fHere we focus on one-mode Bosonic Gaussian channels which act on the density matrices of single Bosonic mode A. A classification of such maps obtained recently in the\npaper [20] allows us to simplify the analysis of the weak-degradability property. In the\nfollowing we start by reviewing the result of Ref. [20], clarifying the connection with the\nanalysis of Ref. [19] (cf. also Ref. [18]). Then we pass to the weak-degradability analysis\nof these channels, showing that with some important exception, they are either weakly\ndegradable or anti-degradable.\n\n2.1\n\nGeneral properties\n\nConsider a single Bosonic mode characterized by canonical observables Qa , Pa obeying\nthe canonical commutation relation [Qa , Pa ] = i. A consistent description of the system\ncan be given in terms of the unitary Weyl operators Va (z) = exp [i(Qa , Pa ) * z], with\nz = (x, y)T being a column vector of R2 . In this framework the canonical commutation\nrelation is written as\ni\nVa (z) Va (z \u2032 ) = exp[ \u2206(z, z \u2032 )] Va (z + z \u2032 ) ,\n2\nwhere \u2206(z, z \u2032 ) is the symplectic form\n\u2206(z, z \u2032 ) = \u2212i z T * \u03c32 * z \u2032 = x\u2032 y \u2212 xy \u2032 ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwith \u03c32 being the second Pauli matrix. Moreover the density operators \u03c1a of the system\ncan be expressed in terms of an integral over z of the Va (z)'s, i.e.\nZ 2\ndz\n\u03c1a =\n\u03c6(\u03c1a ; z) Va (\u2212z) ,\n(2.2)\n2\u03c0\nwith\n\u03c6(\u03c1a ; z) = Tra [\u03c1a Va (z)] ,\n\n(2.3)\n\nbeing the characteristic function of \u03c1a 1 . Consequently a complete description of a\nquantum channel on A is obtained by specifying its action on the operators Va (z), or,\nequivalently, by specifying how to construct the characteristic function \u03c6(\u03a6(\u03c1a ); z) of the\nevolved states. In the case of Gaussian channels \u03a6 this is done by assigning a mapping\nof the Weyl operators\n1\n\u03a6H (Va (z)) = Va (K * z) exp[\u2212 z T * \u03b1 * z + i mT * z] ,\n2\n1\n\nIn effect an analogous decomposition (2.2) holds also for all trace class operators of A [30].\n\n6\n\n(2.4)\n\n\fin the Heisenberg picture, or the transformation of the characteristic functions\n1\n\u03c6(\u03a6(\u03c1a ); z) = \u03c6(\u03c1a ; K * z) exp[\u2212 z T * \u03b1 * z + i mT * z],\n2\n\n(2.5)\n\nin the Schr\u00f6dinger picture. Here m is a vector, while K and \u03b1 are real matrices (the\nlatter being symmetric and positive). Equation (2.5) guarantees that any input Gaussian\ncharacteristic function will remain Gaussian under the action of the map. A useful\nproperty of Gaussian channels is the fact that the composition of two of them (say \u03a6\u2032\nand \u03a6\u2032\u2032 ) is still a Gaussian channel. Indeed one can easily verify that the composite map\n\u03a6\u2032\u2032 \u25e6 \u03a6\u2032 is of the form (2.5) with m, K and \u03b1 given by\nm = (K \u2032\u2032 )T * m\u2032 + m\u2032\u2032\nK = K \u2032 K \u2032\u2032\n\u03b1 = (K \u2032\u2032 )T \u03b1\u2032 K \u2032\u2032 + \u03b1\u2032\u2032 .\n\n(2.6)\n\nHere m\u2032 , K \u2032 , and \u03b1\u2032 belongs to \u03a6\u2032 while m\u2032\u2032 , K \u2032\u2032 , and \u03b1\u2032\u2032 belongs to \u03a6\u2032\u2032 .\nNot all possible choices of K, \u03b1 correspond to transformations \u03a6 which are completely\npositive. A necessary and sufficient condition for this last property (adapted to the case\nof one mode) is provided by the nonnegative definiteness of the following 2 \u00d7 2 Hermitian\nmatrix [3, 20]\n2 \u03b1 \u2212 \u03c32 + K T \u03c32 K .\n(2.7)\n\nThis matrix reduces to 2\u03b1 + (Det[K] \u2212 1) \u03c32 and its nonnegative definiteness to the\ninequality\n\u0012\n\u00132\nDet[K] \u2212 1\nDet[\u03b1] >\n.\n(2.8)\n2\n\nWithin the limit imposed by Eq. (2.8) we can use Eq. (2.5) to describe the whole set of\nthe one-mode Gaussian channels.\n\n2.2\n\nChannels with single-mode physical representation\n\nAn important subset of one-mode Gaussian channels is given by the maps \u03a6 which\npossess a physical representation (1.1) with \u03c1b being a Gaussian state of a single external\nBosonic mode B and with Uab being a canonical transformation of Qa , Pa , Qb and Pb\n(the latter being the canonical observables of the mode B). In particular let \u03c1b be a\nthermal state of average photon number N, i.e.\n\u03c6(\u03c1b ; z) = Trb [\u03c1b Vb (z)] = exp[\u2212(N + 1/2)|z|2 /2] ,\n7\n\n(2.9)\n\n\fand let Uab be such that\n\u2020\nUab\n(Qa , Pa , Qb , Pb ) Uab = (Qa , Pa , Qb , Pb ) * M ,\n\nwith M being a 4 \u00d7 4 symplectic matrix of block form\n\u0012\n\u0013\nm11 | m21\nM\u2261\n.\nm12 | m22\n\n(2.10)\n\n(2.11)\n\nThis yields the following evolution for the characteristic function \u03c6(\u03c1a ; z),\n\u03c6(\u03a6(\u03c1a ); z) = Tra [\u03a6(\u03c1a ) Va (z)] = Tra [\u03c1a \u03a6H (Va (z))]\nh\ni\n\u2020\n= Trab Uab (Va (z) \u2297 11)Uab (\u03c1a \u2297 \u03c1b )\n\u0002\n\u0001\n\u0003\n= Trab Va (m11 * z) \u2297 Vb (m12 * z) (\u03c1a \u2297 \u03c1b )\n= \u03c6(\u03c1a ; m11 * z) exp[\u2212(N + 1/2)|m12 * z|2 /2] ,\n\n(2.12)\n\nwhich is of the form (2.5) by choosing m = 0, K = m11 and \u03b1 = (N + 1/2) mT12 * m12 .\nIt is worth stressing that in the case of Eq. (2.12) the inequality (2.8) is guaranteed by\nthe symplectic nature of the matrix M, i.e. by the fact that Eq. (2.10) preserves the\ncommutation relations among the canonical operators. Indeed we have\nDet[\u03b1] = (N + 1/2)2 Det[m12 ]2 = (N + 1/2)2 (Det[m11 ] \u2212 1)2\n> (Det[K] \u2212 1)2 /4 ,\n\n(2.13)\n\nwhere in the second identity the condition (2.21) was used.\nAs we shall see, with certain important exception one-mode Gaussian channels (2.4)\nare unitarily equivalent to transformations which admit physical representation with \u03c1b\nand Uab as in Eqs. (2.9) and (2.10).\n\n2.3\n\nCanonical form\n\nFollowing Ref. [20] any Gaussian channel (2.5) can be transformed (through unitarily\nequivalence) into a simple canonical form. Namely, given a channel \u03a6 characterized by\nthe vector m and the matrices K, \u03b1 of Eq. (2.5), one can find unitary operators Ua and\nWa such that the channel defined by the mapping\n\u03c1a \u2212\u2192 \u03a6(can) (\u03c1a ) = Wa \u03a6(Ua \u03c1a Ua\u2020 ) Wa\u2020\n8\n\nfor all \u03c1a ,\n\n(2.14)\n\n\fChannel \u03a6\nDet[K]\n0\n0\n1\n1\n2\n\u03ba (\u03ba 6= 0, 1)\n\u2212\u03ba2 (\u03ba 6= 0)\n\nClass\nrank[K] = 0\nrank[K] = 1\nrank[\u03b1] = 1\nrank[\u03b1] 6= 1\n\nA1\nA2\nB1\nB2\nC\nD\n\nCanonical form \u03a6(can)\nKcan\n0\n(11 + \u03c33 )/2\n11\n11\n\u03ba 11\n\u03ba \u03c33\n\n\u03b1can\n(N0 + 1/2) 11\n(N0 + 1/2) 11\n(11 \u2212 \u03c33 )/4\nN0 11\n2\n|\u03ba \u2212 1|(N0 + 1/2) 11\n(\u03ba2 + 1)(N0 + 1/2) 11\n\nTable 1: Canonical form for one-mode Gaussian Bosonic channels. In the first columns\nthe properties of K and \u03b1 of the map \u03a6 are reported. In last two columns instead we\ngive the matrices Kcan and \u03b1can of the canonical form \u03a6(can) associated with \u03a6 - see\nEqs. (2.14) and (2.15). In these expressions \u03c33 is the third Pauli matrix, N0 is a nonnegative constant and \u03ba is a positive constant. Notice that the constraint (2.8) is always\nsatisfied. In B1 the free parameter Nc has been set equal to 1/2 - see discussion below\nEq. (2.17).\nis of the form (2.5) with m = 0 and with K, \u03b1 replaced, respectively, by the matrices\nKcan , \u03b1can of Table 1, i.e.\n1\n\u03c6(\u03a6(can) (\u03c1a ); z) = \u03c6(\u03c1a ; Kcan * z) exp[\u2212 z T * \u03b1can * z] .\n2\n\n(2.15)\n\nAn important consequence of Eq. (2.15) is that to analyze the weak-degradability properties of a one-mode Gaussian channel it is sufficient to focus on the canonical map \u03a6(can)\nwhich is unitarily equivalent to it (see remark at the end of Sec. 1). Here we will not\nenter into the details of the derivation of Eqs. (2.14) and (2.15), see Ref. [20].\nThe dependence on the matrix Kcan of \u03a6(can) upon the parameters of \u03a6 can be summarized as follows,\n\uf8f1 \u001a p\nDet[K] > 0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\npDet[K] 11\nrank[K] 6= 1\n\uf8f2\n|Det[K]| \u03c33\nDet[K] < 0\nKcan =\n(2.16)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n(11 + \u03c33 )/2\nrank[K] = 1 ,\nwith \u03c33 being the third Pauli matrix. Analogously for \u03b1can we have\n\uf8f1 p\nDet[\u03b1] 11\nrank[\u03b1] 6= 1\n\uf8f2\n\u03b1can =\n\uf8f3\nNc (11 \u2212 \u03c33 )/2\nrank[\u03b1] = 1 .\n9\n\n(2.17)\n\n\fB1\n\nA2\nC\n\nD A1\n0\n\nB2\n\n1/2\n\nC\n\n1\n\nFigure 1: Pictorial representation of the classification in terms of canonical forms of\nTable 1. Depending on the values of Det[K], rank[K] and rank[\u03b1] any one-mode Gaussian channel can be transformed to one of the channels of the scheme through unitary\ntransformations as in Eq. (2.14). The point on the thick oriented line for Det[K] < 0\nrepresent the maps of D, those with Det[K] > 0 and Det[K] 6= 1 represent C. The\nclasses A1,2 and B1,2 are represented by the four colored points of the graph. Notice that\nthe channel B2 and A1 can be obtained as limiting cases of D and C. The dotted arrows\nconnect channels which are weakly complementary (1.2) of each others with respect to\nthe physical representations introduced in Sec. 2.4. For instance the weakly complementary of B1 is channel of the class A2 (and vice-versa) - see Sec. 3.1 and Table 2 for\ndetails. Notice that the weakly complementary channel of A1 belongs to B2 . However,\nnot all the channels of B2 have weakly complementary channels which are in A1 - see\nSec. 2.5.\nThe quantity Nc is a free parameter which can set to any positive value upon properly\ncalibrating the unitaries Ua and Wa of Eq. (2.14). Following Ref. [20] we will assume\nNc = 1/2. Notice also that from Eq. (2.8), rank[\u03b1] = 1 is only possible for Det[K] = 1.\nEquations (2.16) and (2.17) show that only the determinant and the rank of K and \u03b1\nare relevant for defining Kcan and \u03b1can . Indeed one can verify that Kcan and \u03b1can maintain the same determinant and rank of the original matrices K and \u03b1, respectively. This\nis a consequence of the fact the \u03a6 and \u03a6(can) are connected through a symplectic transformation for which Det[K], Det[\u03b1], rank[K], and rank[\u03b1] are invariant quantities. [In\nparticular Det[K] is directly related with the invariant quantity q analyzed in Ref. [19].]\np The six inequivalent canonical forms of Table 1 follow by parametrizing the value of\nDet[\u03b1] to account for the constraints imposed by the inequality (2.8). It should be\nnoticed that to determine which class a certain channel belongs to, it is only necessary\nto know if Det[K] is null, equal to 1, negative or positive (6= 1). If Det[K] = 0 the class\n10\n\n\fis determined by the rank of the matrix. If Det[K] = 1 the class is determined by the\nrank of \u03b1 (see Fig. 1). Within the various classes, the specific expression of the canonical\nform depends then upon the effective values of Det[K] and Det[\u03b1]. We observe also that\nthe class A1 can be obtained as a limiting case (for \u03ba \u2192 0) of the maps of class C or\nD. Analogously the class B2 can be obtained as a limiting case of the maps of class\nC. Indeed consider the channel with Kcan = \u03ba11 and \u03b1can = |\u03ba2 \u2212 1|(N0\u2032 + 1/2)11 with\nN0\u2032 = N0 /(|\u03ba2 \u2212 1|) \u2212 1/2, with N0 and \u03ba positive (\u03ba 6= 0, 1). For \u03ba sufficiently close to\n1, N0\u2032 is positive and the maps belongs to the class C of Table 1. Moreover in the limit\nof \u03ba \u2192 1 this channel yields the map B2 .\nFinally it is interesting to study how the canonical forms of Table 1 compose under\nthe product (2.6). A simple calculation shows that the following rules apply\n\u25e6\nA1\nA2\nB1\nB2\nC\nD\n\nA1\nA1\nA1\nA1\nA1\nA1\nA1\n\nA2\nB1\nB2\nC\nD\nA1\nA1\nA1\nA1\nA1\nA2\nA2\nA2\nA2\nA2\nA2\nB1\nB1 /B2\nC\nD\nA2 B1 /B2\nB2\nC\nD\nA2\nC\nC\nB2 /C D\nA2\nD\nD\nD\nC\n\n(2.18)\n\nIn this table, for instance, the element on the row 2 and column 3 represents class (i.e.\nA2 ) associated to the product \u03a6\u2032\u2032 \u25e6 \u03a6\u2032 between a channel \u03a6\u2032 of B1 and a channel \u03a6\u2032\u2032 of\nA2 . Notice that the canonical form of the products B1 \u25e6 B2 , B2 \u25e6 B1 and C \u25e6 C is not\nuniquely defined. In the first case in fact, even though the determinant of the matrix K\nof Eq. (2.6) is one, the rank of the corresponding \u03b1 might be one or different from one\ndepending on the parameters of the two \"factor\" channels: consequently the B1 \u25e6 B2 and\nB2 \u25e6 B1 might belong either to B1 or to B2 . In the case of C \u25e6 C instead it is possible\nthat the resulting channel will have Det[K] = 1 making it a B2 map. Typically however\nC \u25e6 C will be a map of C. Composition rules analogous to those reported here have been\nextensively analyzed in Refs. [19, 16, 17].\n\n2.4\n\nSingle-mode physical representation of the canonical forms\n\nApart from the case B2 that will be treated separately (see next section), all canonical\ntransformations of Table 1 can be expressed as in Eq. (2.12), i.e. through a physical\nrepresentation (1.1) with \u03c1b being a thermal state (2.9) of a single external Bosonic\nmode B and Uab being a linear transformation (2.10)2 . To show this it is sufficient to\n2\n\nThe exceptional role of B2 corresponds to the fact that any one-mode Bosonic Gaussian channel\ncan be represented as a unitary coupling with a single-mode environment plus an additive classical noise\n\n11\n\n\fverify that, for each of the classes of Table 1 but B2 , there exists a non-negative number\nN and a symplectic matrix M such that Eq. (2.12) gives the mapping (2.15). This yields\nthe conditions\nm11 = Kcan ,\nr\n\u03b1can\nm12 = O\n,\nN + 1/2\n\n(2.19)\n(2.20)\n\nwith O T = O \u22121 being an orthogonal 2\u00d72 matrix to be determined through the symplectic\ncondition\nDet[m11 ] + Det[m12 ] = 1 ,\n\n(2.21)\n\n\u2020\n\u2020\nwhich guarantees that Uab\nQa Uab and Uab\nPa Uab satisfy canonical commutation relations.\nIt is worth noticing that once m11 and m12 are determined within the constraint (2.21) the\nremaining blocks (i.e. m21 and m22 ) can always be found in order to satisfy the remaining\nsymplectic conditions of M. An explicit example will be provided in few paragraphs.\nFor the classes A1 , A2 , B1 , D, and C with \u03ba < 1, Eqs. (2.20) and (2.21) can be solved\nby choosing O = 11 and N = N0 . Indeed for B1 the latter setting is not necessary. Any\nnon-negative number will do the job: thus we choose N = 0 making the density matrix\n\u03c1b of Eq. (2.9) the vacuum of the B. For C with \u03ba > 1 instead a solution is obtained by\nchoosing O = \u03c33 and again N = N0 . The corresponding transformations (2.10) for Qa\nand Pa (together with the choice for N) are summarized below.\n\nClass\nA1\nA2\nB1\nC\n\u03ba<1\nC\n\u03ba>1\nD\n\n\u2020\n\u03c1b\nUab\nQa Uab\nthermal(N = N0 )\nQb\nthermal(N = N0 )\nQa + Qb\nvacuum(N = 0)\nQa\n\u221a\nthermal(N = N0 ) \u03ba Qa + \u221a1 \u2212 \u03ba2 Qb\nthermal(N = N0 ) \u03ba Qa + \u221a\u03ba2 \u2212 1 Qb\nthermal(N = N0 ) \u03ba Qa + \u03ba2 + 1 Qb\n\n\u2020\nUab\nPa Uab\nPb\nPb\nPa\u221a+ Pb\n\u03ba Pa + \u221a1 \u2212 \u03ba2 Pb\n\u03ba Pa \u2212 \u221a\u03ba2 \u2212 1 Pb\n\u2212\u03ba Pa + \u03ba2 + 1 Pb .\n\nTo complete the definition of the unitary operators Uab we need to provide also the\ntransformations of Qb and Pb .

We will see in the following sections\nthat the class D is formed by the weakly complementary of the amplifier channels of the\nclass C. For the sake of clarity the explicit expression for the matrices M of the various\nclasses has been reported in App. A.\nFinally it is important to notice that the above physical representations are equivalent\nto Stinespring representations only when the average photon number N of \u03c1b nullifies.\nIn this case the environment B is represented by a pure input state (i.e. the vacuum).\nAccording to our definitions this is always the case for the canonical form B1 while for\nthe canonical forms A1 , A2 , C and D it happens for N0 = 0.\n\n2.5\n\nThe class B2 : additive classical noise channel\n\nAs mentioned in the previous section the class B2 of Table 1 must be treated separately.\nThe map B2 corresponds3 to the additive classical noise channel [3] defined by\nZ\n\u03a6(\u03c1a ) = d2 z p(z) Va (z) \u03c1a Va (\u2212z) ,\n(2.22)\nwith p(z) = (2\u03c0N0 )\u22121 exp[\u2212|z|2 /(2N0 )] which, in Heisenberg picture, can be seen as a\nrandom shift of the annihilation operator a.\nThese channels admit a natural physical representation which involve two environmental modes in a pure state (see Ref. [20] for details) but do not have a physical\nrepresentations (1.1) involving a single environmental mode. This can be verified by\nnoticing that in this case, from Eqs.

In the first column is indicated the class of \u03a6. In the central columns instead is\ngiven a description of \u03a6\u0303 in terms of the representation (2.5). Finally in the last column\nis reported the canonical form corresponding to the map \u03a6\u0303. In all cases the identification\nis immediate: for instance the canonical form of the map \u03a6\u0303A1 belongs to the class B2 ,\nwhile the canonical form of the map \u03a6\u0303D is the class C with Det[Kcan ] > 1. In the\ncase of \u03a6\u0303A2 the identification with the class B1 was done by exploiting the possibility\nfreely varying Nc of Eq. (2.17) - see Ref. [20]. A pictorial representation of the above\nweak-degradability connections is given in Fig. 1.\nwhich yields\nDet[m11 ] + Det[m12 ] = 1 \u00b1 N0 /(N + 1/2) ,\n\n(2.25)\n\nindependently of the choice of the orthogonal matrix O 4 . Therefore, apart from the trivial\ncase N0 = 0, the only solution to the constraint (2.21) is by taking the limit N \u2192 \u221e.\nThis would correspond to representing the channel B2 in terms of a linear coupling with\na single-mode thermal state \u03c1b of \"infinite\" temperature. Unfortunately this is not a well\ndefined object. However we can use the \"asymptotic\" representation described at the\nend of Sec. 2.3 where it was shown how to obtain B2 as limiting case of C class maps, to\nclaim at least that there exists a one-parameter family of one-mode Gaussian channels\nwhich admits single-mode physical representation and which converges to B2 .\n4\n\nThis follows from the fact that Det[O] = \u00b11 since OT = O\u22121 .\n\n14\n\n\f3\n\nWeak-degradability of one-mode Gaussian channels\n\nIn the previous section we have seen that all one-mode Gaussian channels are unitarily\nequivalent to one of the canonical forms of Table 1. Moreover we verified that, with the\nexception of the class B2 , all the canonical forms admits a physical representation (1.1)\nwith \u03c1b being a thermal state of a single environmental mode and Uab being a linear coupling. Here we will use such representations to construct the weakly complementary (1.2)\nof these channels and to study their weak-degradability properties.\n\n3.1\n\nWeakly complementary channels\n\nIn this section we construct the weakly complementary channels \u03a6\u0303 of the class A1 , A2 ,\nB1 , C and D starting from their single-mode physical representations (1.1) of Sec. 2.4.\nBecause of the linearity of Uab and the fact that \u03c1b is Gaussian, the channels \u03a6\u0303 are\nGaussian. This can be seen for instance by computing the characteristic function (2.3)\nof the output state \u03a6\u0303(\u03c1a )\n\u03c6(\u03a6\u0303(\u03c1a ); z) = Trb [\u03a6\u0303(\u03c1a ) Vb (z)] = Trb [\u03c1a \u03a6\u0303H (Vb (z))]\n1\n= \u03c6(\u03c1a ; m21 * z) exp[\u2212 (N + 1/2) |m22 * z|2 ] ,\n2\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere m21 , m22 are the blocks elements of the matrix M of Eq. (2.11) associated with\nthe transformations Uab , and with N being the average photon number of \u03c1b (the values\nof these quantities are given in the tables of Sec. 2.4 - see also App. A). By setting\nm = 0, K = m21 and \u03b1 = (N + 1/2) mT22 m22 , Eq. (3.1) has the same structure (2.5)\nof the one-mode Gaussian channel of A. Therefore by cascading \u03a6\u0303 with an isometry\nwhich exchanges A with B (see Refs. [31, 19]) we can then treat \u03a6\u0303 as an one-mode\nGaussian channel operating on A (this is possible because both A and B are Bosonic\none-mode systems). With the help of Table 1 we can then determine which classes can\nbe associated with the transformation (3.1). This is summarized in Table 2.\n\n3.2\n\nWeak-degradability properties\n\nUsing the compositions rules of Eqs.p(2.6) and (2.18) it is easy to verify that the canonical\n(1.10). Vice-versa one can\nforms A1 , A2 , D and C with \u03ba 6 1/2 are anti-degradable\np\nverify that the canonical forms B1 and C with \u03ba > 1/2 are weakly degradable (1.9) -\nfor C, D and A1 these results have been proved in Ref.

All canonical forms with Det[K] 6 1/2 are anti-degradable: this includes\nthe classes A1 , A2 , D and part of the C. The remaining (with the exception of B2 ) are\ninstead weakly degradable. Moreover B1 is also degradable in the sense of Ref. [22]. The\nsame holds for channels of canonical form C with N0 = 0: the exact expression for the\nquantum capacity of these channels has been given in Ref. [21].\nthis can be summarized by saying that all one-mode Gaussian channels (2.5) having\nDet[K] 6 1/2 are anti-degradable, while the others (with the exception of the channels\nbelonging to B2 ) are weakly degradable (see Fig. 2).\nIn the following we verify the above relations by explicitly constructing the connecting\nchannels \u03a8 and \u03a8 of Eqs. (1.9) and (1.10) for each of the mentioned canonical forms.\nIndeed one has:\n\u2022 For a channel \u03a6 of standard form A1 or A2 , anti-degradability can be shown by simply taking \u03a8 of Eq. (1.10) coincident with the channel \u03a6. The result immediately\nfollows from the composition rule (2.6).\n\u2022 For a channel \u03a6 of B1 , weak-degradability comes by assuming the map \u03a8 to be\nequal to the weakly complementary channel \u03a6\u0303 of \u03a6 (see Table 2). As pointed out\nin Ref. [20] this also implies the degradability of \u03a6 in the sense of Ref. [22]. Let us\nremind that for B1 the physical representation given in Sec. 2.4 was constructed\nwith an environmental state \u03c1b initially prepared in the vacuum state, which is\npure. Therefore in this case our representation gives rise to a Stinespring dilation.\n\u2022 For a channel \u03a6 of the class C with Kcan = \u03ba 11 and \u03b1can = |\u03ba2 \u2212 1|(N0 + 1/2)11 we\nhave the following three possibilities:\np\n\u2013 If \u03ba 6 1/2 the channel is anti-degradable and the connecting map \u03a8 is a\n16\n\n\fchannel of C \u221acharacterized by Kcan = \u03ba\u2032 11 and \u03b1can = (1 \u2212 (\u03ba\u2032 )2 )(N0 + 1/2)11\nwith \u03ba\u2032 = \u03ba/ 1 \u2212 \u03ba2 < 1.\np\n\u2013 If \u03ba \u2208 [ 1/2, 1[ the channel is weakly degradable and the connecting map\n\u2032\n\u03a8\n\u221a is again a channel of C defined as in the previous case but with \u03ba =\n1 \u2212 \u03ba2 /\u03ba < 1. For N0 = 0 the channel is also degradable [22] since our\nphysical representation is equivalent to a Stinespring representation.\n\u2013 If \u03ba > 1 the channel is weakly degradable and the connecting map \u03a8 is a\n\u2032\n\u2032 2\nchannel\n\u221a of D with Kcan = \u03ba 11 and \u03b1can = ((\u03ba ) \u2212 1)(N0 + 1/2)11 with\n\u2032\n2\n\u03ba = k \u2212 1/k. As in the previous case, for N0 = 0 the channel is also\ndegradable [22].\n\u2022 For a channel \u03a6 of D with Kcan = \u03ba \u03c33 and \u03b1can = (\u03ba2 + 1)(N0 + 1/2)11 (\u03ba > 0\nand N0 > 0) we can prove anti-degradability by choosing \u03a8 of Eq. (1.10) to be yet\nanother\u221amaps of D with Kcan = \u03ba\u2032 \u03c33 and \u03b1can = ((\u03ba\u2032 )2 + 1)(N0 + 1/2)11 where\n\u03ba\u2032 = \u03ba/ \u03ba2 + 1. From Eq. (2.6) and Table 2 it then follows that \u03a8 \u25e6 \u03a6\u0303 is indeed\nequal to \u03a6.\nConcerning the case B2 it was shown in Ref. [20] that the channel is neither antidegradable nor degradable in the sense of [22] (apart from the trivial case N0 = 0 which\ncorresponds to the identity map). On the other hand one can use the continuity argument\ngiven in Sec. 2.5 to claim that the channel B2 can be arbitrarily approximated with maps\nwhich are weakly degradable (those belonging to C for instance).\n\n4\n\nOne-mode Gaussian channels with Det[K] > 1/2\nand having null quantum capacity\n\nIn the previous section we saw that all channels (2.5) with Det[K] 6 1/2 are antidegradable. Consequently these channel must have null quantum capacity [19, 31]. Here\nwe go a little further showing that the set of the maps (2.5) which can be proved to have\nnull quantum capacity include also some maps with Det[K] > 1/2. To do this we will\nuse the following simple fact:\nLet be \u03a61 a quantum channel with null quantum capacity and let be \u03a62 some quantum\nchannel. Then the composite channels \u03a61 \u25e6 \u03a62 and \u03a62 \u25e6 \u03a61 have null quantum capacity.\nThe proof of this property follows by interpreting \u03a62 as a quantum operation performed either at the decoding or at encoding stage of the channel \u03a61 . This shows that\nthe quantum capacities of \u03a61 \u25e6 \u03a62 and \u03a62 \u25e6 \u03a61 cannot be greater than the capacity of\n17\n\n\f6\n\n3\n2\n1\n\nEq.

For\nDet[K] < 1/2 the channel is anti-degradable. In the remaining white area the quantum\ncapacity is null since these maps can be obtained by a composition of channels one of\nwhich being anti-degradable. The curve in black refers to the bound of Eq. (4.3). The\ncontour of the dark-grey area is instead given by Eq. (4.6).\n\u03a61 (which is null). In the following we will present two cases where the above property\nturns out to provide some nontrivial results.\n\n4.1\n\nComposition of two class D channels\n\nWe observe that according to composition rule (2.18) the combination of any two channels\n\u03a61 and \u03a62 of D produces a map \u03a621 \u2261 \u03a62 \u25e6 \u03a61 which is in the class C. Since the class D\nis anti-degradable the resulting channel must have null quantum capacity. Let then \u03baj \u03c33\nand (\u03ba2j + 1)(Nj + 1/2)11 be the matrices Kcan and \u03b1can of the channels \u03a6j , for j = 1, 2.\nFrom Eq. (2.6) one can then verify that \u03a621 has the canonical form C with parameters\n\u03ba = \u03ba1 \u03ba2 ,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(\u03ba22 + 1)N2 + \u03ba22 (\u03ba21 + 1)N1 1 \u03ba21 \u03ba22 + 2\u03ba22 + 1\nN0 =\n+\n\u22121 .\n|\u03ba21 \u03ba22 \u2212 1|\n2\n|\u03ba21 \u03ba22 \u2212 1|\n\n18\n\n(4.1)\n(4.2)\n\n\fEquation (4.1) shows that\np by varying \u03baj , \u03ba can take any positive values: in particular\nit can be greater than 1/2 transforming \u03a621 into a channel which does not belong to\nthe anti-degradable area of Fig. 2. On the other hand, by varying the Nj and \u03ba2 , but\nkeeping the product \u03ba1 \u03ba2 fixed, the parameter N0 can assume any value satisfying the\ninequality\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 \u03ba2 + 1\n\u22121 .\n(4.3)\nN0 >\n2 |\u03ba2 \u2212 1|\nWe can therefore conclude that all channels C with \u03ba and N0 as in Eq. (4.3) have null\nquantum capacity - see Fig. 3. A similar bound was found in a completely different\nway in Ref. [3].\n\n4.2\n\nComposition of two class C channels\n\nConsider now the composition of two class C channels, i.e. \u03a61 and \u03a62 , with one of them\n(say \u03a62 ) being anti-degradable.\nHere, the canonical form of \u03a61 and \u03a62 have matrices Kcan and \u03b1can given by Ki = \u03baj 11\nand \u03b1j = |\u03ba2j \u2212 1|(Nj + 1/2)11, where for j = 1, 2, Nj and \u03baj are positive numbers, with\np\n\u03ba1 6= 0, 1 and with \u03ba2 \u2208]0, 1/2] (to ensure anti-degradability). From Eq. (2.6) follows\nthen that the composite map \u03a621 = \u03a62 \u25e6 \u03a61 has still a C canonical form with parameters\n\u03ba = \u03ba1 \u03ba2 ,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n|\u03ba22 \u2212 1|N2 + \u03ba22 |\u03ba21 \u2212 1|N1 1 \u03ba22 |\u03ba21 \u2212 1| + |\u03ba22 \u2212 1|\n+\n\u22121 .\nN0 =\n|\u03ba21 \u03ba22 \u2212 1|\n2\n|\u03ba21 \u03ba22 \u2212 1|\n\n(4.4)\n\n(4.5)\n\nAs in the previous example, \u03ba can assume any positive value. Vice-versa keeping \u03ba fixed,\nand varying \u03ba1 > 1 and N1,2 it follows that N0 can take any values which satisfy the\ninequality\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u03ba2\nN0 >\n\u22121 .\n(4.6)\n2 |\u03ba2 \u2212 1|\nWe can then conclude that all maps C with \u03ba and N0 as above must possess null quantum\ncapacity. The result has been plotted in Fig. 3. Notice that the constraint (4.6) is an\nimprovement with respect to the constraint of Eq. (4.3).\n\n5\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper we provide a full weak-degradability classification of one-mode Gaussian\nchannels by exploiting the canonical form decomposition of Ref. [20]. Within this context\n19\n\n\fwe identify those channels which are anti-degradable. By exploiting composition rules of\nGaussian maps, this allows us to strengthen the bound for one-mode Gaussian channels\nwhich have not null quantum capacity.\nF.C. and V.G. thank the Quantum Information research program of Centro di Ricerca\nMatematica Ennio De Giorgi of Scuola Normale Superiore for financial support.
