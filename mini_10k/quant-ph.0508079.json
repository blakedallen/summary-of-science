In a diffraction experiment with xrays, a metal alloy composed of iron and aluminium was investigated. The diffraction\npattern shows fluctuations in time when the x-ray beam is focused to a very small\nsize of a few micrometers. The number of these temporal fluctuations is so small that\nthey now become visible as x-ray intensity fluctuations (i.e., as opposed to a static\npattern when the number is much higher). In other words, this gives \"clear-cut\nevidence that temporal structural fluctuations on an atomic scale are present in the\ncrystal\". [Mocuta et al. 2005]\n\n\fUsually, metals or crystals are often evoking the ideal of some kind of \"eternal\nstability\", at least in a metaphorical sense. Hardly does one ever consider these\nsolids as objects, which when looked at close enough, reveal a wild sea of fluctuating\nconstituents. Or, considered the other way 'round, it is seldom recognized that\nstability in our \"macroscopic\" world is an emergent phenomenon based on a very\nlarge number of restless constituents. As Nobel laureate Robert Laughlin argues so\nconvincingly in his new book [Laughlin 2005], emergence is a collective effect of a\nhuge number of particles that usually cannot be deduced from the microscopic\nequations of motion in a rigorous way and that disappears completely when the\nsystem is taken apart. In fact, in said book Laughlin also promotes the idea that one\ncan visualize the vacuum (of only apparently \"empty space\") as analogous to the\nground state of a condensed matter system, with ordinary matter being analogous to\nexcited states of this system.\nThis is particularly interesting for those who are interested in a deeper understanding\nof why quantum theory looks (and works) the way it does. For this theory, the most\nfundamental one concerned with experimentally falsifyable statements on the nature\nof matter's basic constituents, is also characterized by features of \"stability\", viz., the\nlinearity of its basic equation, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, and the validity of the socalled superposition principle. So, the idea is today increasingly being investigated,\nwhether quantum systems might not be emergent phenomena themselves from an\nhypothesized underlying non-linear sub-quantum dynamics. (For an early paper on\nthis topic, see [Gr\u00f6ssing 1989].) In particular, there exists a long tradition of attempts\nto explain quantum theory on the basis of an assumed fluid substrate, sometimes\n(again) called an \"aether\", whose particle-like constituents undergo diffusion-like\nprocesses very similar to the familiar Brownian motion of molecules suspended in\nwater. However, so far approaches focusing solely on the particle constituents of the\nhypothesized sub-quantum medium in a reductionist manner have largely remained\nunsatisfactory. The idea of emergence playing a key role in various domains of\nphysics thus leads to the suggestion that also the wave-like phenomena of quantum\ntheory might be nothing but emergent ones due to the presence of a huge number of\nparticle-like constituents of the sub-quantum medium.\nIn other words, only a strictly reductionist view of nature would claim that, \"in the\nend\", or at the \"deepest level\" of explanations possible, matter would behave\n2\n\n\faccording to rules applying to their \"ultimate building blocks\", like, e.g., some kind of\n\"elementary particles\". Actually, a predominant view of quantum theory for many\nyears has been one that favored such an approach, i.e., that matter was ultimately\ncomposed of \"particles\" following specific rules of propagation (viz., Feynman's path\nintegral formalism, for example). However, along with such an approach also came\nthe view that the specific rules just mentioned are, albeit working perfectly well, not\nunderstood at all.\nSo, it is only legitimate to search for different approaches, including ones which do\nnot assume a strictly reductionist view from the start. In fact, what shall be proposed\nhere is a view which maintains that, at least as far as quantum theory is concerned,\nno single \"ultimate\" level of explanations in terms of particles is possible, but rather,\nthat nature might be composed such that a complete description of quantum\nphenomena is only possible when the physics of particles and of waves are\ncombined within one modelling frame. With the (since many years) well-established\nknowledge that the so-called \"vacuum\" is not empty at all, but constitutes some kind\nof \"medium\" in which \"particles\" may propagate, one very natural approach to\nquantum phenomena may in fact be considered under such premises.\nAs was shown by the work of Nelson [Nelson 1966 and 1985], motion according to\nthe Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be reduced to a Brownian-type motion on an assumed\n\"fluid\" sub-quantum level, where particles undergo collisions in the framework of\ndiffusion processes according to well-known laws of hydrodynamics. However, one of\nthe problems with Nelson's approach is given by the fact that it cannot account for\nthe by now well-established nonlocal features of the theory. (See, however, [Fritsche\nand Haugk 2003].) Still, this may very well be due to the fact that also Nelson's\napproach exclusively considers one \"basic level\", i.e., the particle dynamics, only.\nConsidering that classical Brownian motion describes the motion of particles\nsuspended in some medium, it would only be logical to consider said hypothesized\nsub-quantum dynamics in such a way that a description of both particles and waves\nis necessary, the latter actually originating from the particles, i.e., being created by\nthe particles' \"wiggly\" motions in the \"fluid\" medium.\n\n3\n\n\fWithin a thus circumscribed modelling framework, it is in fact possible to show that\nthe essence of quantum theory (i.e., the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, Heisenberg's\nuncertainty relations, the superposition principle and Born's Rule for the probability\namplitudes) can be derived from classical physics \u2013 albeit only under a new\nperspective of the latter as well. [Gr\u00f6ssing 2004, 2005a, 2005b]\nIn my approach, both the particle positions and the wave configurations represent\n\"hidden (or rather, with Bell, uncontrollable) variables\" to be suitably described by\nsome sub-quantum dynamics. This means, among other things, that\nSchr\u00f6dinger's wave function\u03c8 does not need a realistic ontology itself (as\nSchr\u00f6dinger himself still assumed), but only represents, just like in the orthodox\n\"Copenhagen\" interpretation, the totality of our knowledge about the quantum state.\n[In this sense, an alternative, i.e., the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation, also got stuck\n\u201ehalf way\", because in it the (unexplained) wave function still has fundamental status,\nwith the \u201ehidden variables\" being determined by functions of it.]\nIt is only the approaches by Nelson, and recently also my own one, which try to\nprovide an explanation of the\u03c8 function and the Schr\u00f6dinger equation describing its\ntemporal evolution, with particular attention being paid in my work to the nonlocal\nfeatures of the theory. The latter becomes feasible exactly by attributing wave\nphenomena an equal status with the particle phenomena. Thus, quantum mechanics\n(as opposed to classical physics) is pictured as describing the motion of particles\nsubject to fluctuations stemming either from a) particle-particle collisions on a subquantum level, or b) from wave fronts determined by the wave configurations of the\nsurrounding medium. (A very similar approach is also found in [Baker-Jarvis and\nKabos 2003].)\nOne can show that the latter is co-determined by the totality of the experimental\nsetup, and thus is essentially of nonlocal character. Even in the domain of classical\nphysics, then, particles can be imagined to be the origins of such waves, but in this\ncase \u2013 just like in a \"zooming\" out from the observed object \u2013 the fluctuations will be,\nrelatively speaking, too small and thus unobservable. The stochastic particle\ntrajectory then looks \"smoothed out\", and the waves practically are emitted in a\ncentric-symmetric manner (Fig. 1) so that they don't carry away any momentum \u2013 in\nclear contradistinction to the \"zoomed in\" view of the quantum case, where exactly\n4\n\n\fthis is happening and the corresponding fluctuations (or changes of particle\nmomentum, respectively) are responsible for the \"quantum phenomena\".\nLet me start by recalling the famous \u201elight clock\", with which one can nicely illustrate\nEinstein's ideas on the relativity of simultaneity [Einstein 1905a]. Here we consider\nonly the idealized case of a photon bouncing back and forth between two parallel\nmirrors. Each time, the photon completes a \"roundtrip\", the clock \"ticks\". Thus, this\nclock has an insurmountable limit of its time measuring capability given by the\ninverse \"frequency\" of said roundtrip. The best temporal resolution is given by\n\n\u2206t = 1 \u03a9 , and this light clock, being a so-called \"harmonical oscillator\", can in a\ncompletely equivalent manner be represented by a fiber-optic light-guide in the form\nof a ring with radius r . The angular frequency is then given by \u03a9 = c r , where c is\nthe velocity of light in the light clock. (In other words: Although one may consider a\nhypothetical, continuous process relating to the propagation of the photon, the\noperationally relevant quantity corresponds to a discretization of time into minimal\ntime steps \u2206t .)\nNow we remember Einstein's other work from 1905, i.e., on the \"light-electrical\neffect\", where for the first time the energy E of a particle is given in its \u201equantized\"\nform [Einstein 1905b],\n\nE = =\u03c9 ,\nwhere = = h 2\u03c0 , with h being Planck's quantum of action and\n\n(1.1)\n\n\u03c9 the characteristic\n\nangular frequency of the photon. However, since the oscillating photon can be\ndescribed as a \u201eharmonical oscillator\", we can now describe the single photon itself\nas a \"miniaturized light clock\": Also in this case are we dealing with an\ninsurmountable limitation of temporal resolution, now given by the angular frequency\nof the photon itself. In other words, the idealized \"continuous\" time axis must in an\noperational sense be discretized, so that one has \"coarse grained\" intervals of\nminimal temporal resolution \u03b4 t , with their inverse given by a fixed quantity, i.e., the\nangular frequency:\n\n1\n\u2192 \u03c9 . This will be of great use in the following. Next to\n\u03b4t\n\nequation (1.1) defining the energy we shall have to consider another empirical finding,\n5\n\n\fi.e., that per degree of freedom one has to add an additional amount of energy, the\nso-called \"zero-point energy\"\n\n\u03b4 E = E0 =\n\n=\u03c9\n.\n2\n\n(1.2)\n\nIt represents fluctuations of particle energy based on the \"restless\" environment of\nthe so-called \"vacuum\", which is why one also speaks of \"vacuum fluctuations\". They\nwere first measured by [Mulliken 1924], i.e., before today's quantum theory, or the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation, were formalized.\nIn other words, as our \"miniaturized clocks\", with their typical angular frequencies, are\nembedded in a medium characterized by \"vacuum fluctuations\", one may consider\nthem as \"fluid clocks\": periodic oscillations in an environment that is ultimately\ndescribed by the laws of hydrodynamics.\n\nII.\n\nEmergence of quantum theory from sub-quantum dynamics\n\nEquations (1.1) and (1.2) are, together with de Broglie's equation, in complete\nanalogy to (1.1), for the momentum, p = =k (with wave number k ), the only\nempirical, or \u201efundamental\", equations necessary for the derivation of the Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation, as shall be shown now. In a first step, we shall derive a useful relation from\nclassical statistical mechanics. Although the \"particle\" (our \"fluid clock\"), being\nembedded by the zero-point fluctuations of the surrounding vacuum, will generally be\nin a thermo-dynamical state off equilibrium, one can nevertheless assume the limiting\ncase of thermodynamic equilibrium exactly for the states fulfilling some extremal\ncondition. This would then be in accordance with our assumption that the \"pure\"\nstates of quantum theory correspond to emergent eigenstates of an underlying\ndynamics which more generally would have to be described by non-equilibrium\nthermodynamics. Still, for the equilibrium scenario between a \"particle\" and the\nsurrounding vacuum, and using the familiar expression for entropy,\n\nSe = k ln P (where k is Boltzmann's constant and P denotes the \"probability\ndensity\"), one can write in differential notation:\n6\n\n\fd ln P =\n\nd (\u03b4 E )\ndQ\n=\u2212\n,\nkT\n\u03b4E\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere Q and T describe heat exchange and surrounding temperature, respectively,\nand\n\n\u03b4 E describes an \"energy bath\", which we can now identify with the thermal bath\n\nof the zero-point energy. With the limited temporal resolution\n\n\u03b4 t = 1 \u03c9 discussed\n\nabove, i.e., as given by the inverse angular frequency, one obtains with the insertion\nof equation (1.2) into (2.1) that\n\n2\nd ln P = \u2212 d (\u03b4 E ) \u03b4 t.\n=\n\n(2.2)\n\nIntroducing now, for sufficiently large time spans, the transition from the \"coarse\ngrained\" time to the \"practically continuous\" time t , we get from (2.2):\n\n\u2202\n2\nln Pdt = \u2212 d (\u03b4 E ) dt.\n\u2202t\n=\n\n(2.3)\n\nNow one can introduce the action function S from classical physics, which provides\nfor the energy that E = \u2212\n\n\u03b4E =\u2212\n\n\u2202\nS . Then, of course, one has for the energy fluctuations\n\u2202t\n\n\u2202\n\u03b4 S . They are conserved for short (but still much larger than \u03b4 t = 1 \u03c9 )\n\u2202t\n\nperiods of time, so that one can then note that\nmeans that\n\n\u03b4 S = constant (which trivially also\n\n\u2202\nd (\u03b4 S ) = 0 ). Thus we can rewrite equation (2.3) :\n\u2202t\n\u2202\n2\nln Pdt = d (\u03b4 S ) .\n\u2202t\n=\n\n(2.4)\n\nThis equation will be very useful, as will be seen shortly. When identical to zero, it\ntells us that the relative temporal variation of the probability density P is extremal\nand thus in accordance with a minimal action principle for the fluctuation\n\n7\n\n\u03b4S.\n\n\fNow we turn our attention to the \"fluid\" part of the model. One usually starts off with\nthe so-called \"continuity equation\", which describes the classical law of the\nconservation of a \"probability current\" (i.e., due to the stochastic nature of the\nparticipating fluid elements) in so-called \"configuration space\". With (normalized)\nprobability density P , the continuity equation describes the temporal change of said\ndensity in a given spatial volume as determined by the flow of the particle current\n(described by the gradient, i.e., the Nabla operator, \u2207 ) with velocity v :\n\n\u2202P\n= \u2212\u2207 ( vP ) .\n\u2202t\n\n(2.5)\n\nMultiplication by dt and division by P then gives\n\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n\n\uf8eb \u2207P \u22c5 v + \u2207 \u22c5 v \uf8f6 dt .\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed P\n\uf8f8\n\nln Pdt = \u2212 \uf8ec\n\n(2.6)\n\nComparison of equations (2.4) and (2.6) thus finally provides\n\n\u2202\n2\n2\nln Pdt = d (\u03b4 S ) = (\u03b4 pdx \u2212 \u03b4 Edt ) .\n\u2202t\n=\n=\n\n(2.7)\n\nOn the r.h.s. of (2.7), we have introduced two quantities representing the fluctuating\ncontributions of the vacuum to momentum and energy of the particle, respectively.\nComparing with equation (2.6), they are explicitly given by\n\n\u03b4 p =: =k u = \u2207 (\u03b4 S ) = \u2212\n\n= \u2207P\n,\n2 P\n\n\u03b4E=\n\n=\n(\u2207\u22c5 v ) .\n2\n\n(2.8)\n\nEquation (2.8) thus introduces a new momentum component according to the\nassumed additional fluctuations, which can be understood partly as due to the\ninfluence of Huygens wave fronts (Fig.1, and [Gr\u00f6ssing 2004]) such that for the total\nmomentum one now has\n\n8\n\n\fp tot = =k tot = p + pu ,\nwhere p = =k = \u2207S ,\nand pu = =k u = \u2212= \u2207P 2 P = \u2212 = \u2207R R.\n\n(2.9)\n\nFig. 1:\nSchematic distinction of classical (\"Hamiltonian\") flow (left) and quantum flow (right), with the circles\nindicating the propagation of spherical Huygens wave surfaces at arbitrary distances (from [Gr\u00f6ssing\n2004]). The dotted lines in the figure on the right indicate symbolically that the waves pictured\nrepresent only the local surroundings of a generally extending probability field, thus illustrating that the\nfluctuations shown are to be seen in the context of the whole (and possibly nonlocal) embedding\nenvironment.\n\n9\n\n\fIn equation (2.9) we have also made use of the fact that for the intensity of classical\nwaves with amplitude R it holds that P = R . When taking the averages (denoted by\n2\n\nbars) and integrating over positions and fluctuations, one can show that both the\naverage energy fluctuation and the integral over k \u22c5 k u vanishes (see Fig. 1 for\nillustration, and [Gr\u00f6ssing 2004] for details). One can thus write down the classical\naction integral with the new momentum expression and with some external\npotential V ,\n\n\uf8f1\uf8f4 \u2202S = 2 k 2\n\uf8fc\uf8f4\ntot\n+ V \uf8fdd n xdt ,\nA = \u222b P\uf8f2 +\n2m\n\uf8f4\uf8f3 \u2202t\n\uf8f4\uf8fe\n\n(2.10)\n\nwhere\n\n=k tot = \u2207 ( S + \u03b4 S ) = \u2207S \u2212 =\n\n\u2207R\n= =k + =k u .\nR\n\n(2.11)\n\nNow we introduce the so-called \"Madelung transformation\" (with the star denoting\ncomplex conjugation),\ni\n( \u2212) S\n(\u2217)\n=\n\u03c8 = Re\n.\n(2.12)\nThus one has\n\n\u2207\u03c8\n\n\u2207R i\n\u2207\u03c8\n=\n+ \u2207S , and\nR =\n\u03c8\n\u03c8\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\uf8eb \u2207R \uf8f6 \uf8eb \u2207S \uf8f6\n=\uf8ec\n\uf8f7 +\uf8ec\n\uf8f7 ,\n\uf8ed R \uf8f8 \uf8ed = \uf8f8\n\n(2.13)\n\nand one obtains a new transformation between the formulations of classical physics\nand orthodox quantum theory: the square of the average total momentum is given by\n\nptot\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\uf8ee \uf8eb \u2207R \uf8f6 2 \uf8eb \u2207S \uf8f6 2 \uf8f9\n2 \u2207\u03c8\n.\n= = \uf8ef\uf8ec\n\uf8f7 +\uf8ec\n\uf8f7 \uf8fa==\n\u03c8\nR\n=\n\uf8f8 \uf8ed\n\uf8f8 \uf8fa\uf8fb\n\uf8ef\uf8f0\uf8ed\n2\n\n10\n\n(2.14)\n\n\fWith P = R = \u03c8\n2\n\n2\n\nfrom equation (2.12) one can rewrite (2.10) as\n\n2\n\uf8ee 2 \uf8eb \u2202S\n2\uf8f9\n\uf8f6 =\nA = \u222b Ldt = \u222b d n xdt \uf8ef \u03c8 \uf8ec\n+V \uf8f7 +\n\u2207\u03c8 \uf8fa.\n\uf8ed \u2202t\n\uf8f8 2m\n\uf8f0\n\uf8fb\n\n(2.15)\n\nFurther, with the identity\n\n\u03c8\n\n2\n\ni=\n\u2202S\n= \u2212 (\u03c8 \u2217\u03c8\u0005 \u2212 \u03c8\u0005 \u2217\u03c8 )\n\u2202t\n2\n\none finally obtains the well-known \"Lagrange density\"\n\ni= \u2217\n=2\n\u2217\n\u0005\n\u0005\nL = \u2212 (\u03c8 \u03c8 \u2212 \u03c8 \u03c8 ) +\n\u2207\u03c8 \u22c5 \u2207\u03c8 \u2217 + V\u03c8 \u2217\u03c8 .\n2\n2m\n\n(2.16)\n\nAs given by the standard procedures of classical physics, this Lagrangian density\nprovides (via the so-called Euler-Lagrange equations) the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\n\n\uf8f6\n\u2202\u03c8 \uf8eb = 2 2\n= \uf8ec\u2212\n\u2207 + V \uf8f7\u03c8 .\ni=\n\u2202t \uf8ed 2m\n\uf8f8\n\n(2.17)\n\nHere, the function \u03c8 does not appear as an operational physical quantity, but only as\na compact notation which, according to equation (2.14), puts together in one\ncomplex-valued quantity the momentum components of waves (fluctuations) and\nparticles.
