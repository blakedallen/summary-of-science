In the same way, the study of the chemical composition of metalpoor H II regions is crucial for the understanding of the primordial chemical composition\nof the Universe. Most of these studies have been done using abundances obtained from the\nso called direct method, which assumes a homogeneous temperature throughout the whole\nvolume of the object and then uses this temperature to determine abundances of all available\nions; this temperature is commonly obtained from the [O III] collisionally excited line ratio\n\u03bb\u03bb 4363/(4959+5007); hereafter we will call this procedure the Te (4363/5007) method.\nUnfortunately, the simplification of the thermal structure of H II regions implied by the\nTe (4363/5007) method, yields lower abundances than those obtained with other methods.\nFor example: (i) the O/H abundances derived from recombination lines, (ii) the O/H abundances derived by comparing the nebular lines with photoionization models, and (iii) the\ncomparison of the O/H nebular abundances (including gas and dust), with those derived\nfrom B stars and young F and G stars (e.g. Bensby & Feltzing 2006; Kewley & Ellison 2008;\nPrzybilla et al. 2008; Peimbert & Peimbert 2011; Sim\u00f3n-D\u0131\u0301az & Stasi\u0144ska 2011; Nieva, & Przybilla\n2012). The abundances derived from these three different methods are consistent within the\nerrors. The abundances obtained through collisionally excited lines corrected for the presence\nof thermal inhomogeneities are consistent with the abundances obtained through other methods. For reviews on such issue see Peimbert & Peimbert (2011) and L\u00f3pez-S\u00e1nchez et al.\n(2012).\nAbundances obtained with the Te (4363/5007) method are underestimated because the\ntemperature used in the determination process is assumed to be uniform. In the presence of\neither local or global thermal inhomogeneities, collisionally excited lines will be brighter in\nthe hot regions while recombination lines will be brighter in the cool regions. This leads to\nchoosing a temperature higher than the average and thus to assume that less oxygen (and\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nmore hydrogen), than the amount that is actually present, is needed in order to reproduce\nthe observed line intensities. For this reason, these abundances should be corrected for the\npresence of thermal inhomogeneities before being used to calibrate any strong-line indicator.\nPagel et al. (1979) were the firsts to introduce the R23 versus 12+log(O/H) diagram\n(from here on, this diagram will be referred to as the R23 \u2013 O/H diagram). They found\nthat the sum of the intensities of nebular oxygen with respect to H\u03b2, I([O II] 3727) +\nI([O III] 4959+5007)/I(H\u03b2), varied smoothly with the total oxygen abundance and proposed to use what is now known as R23 , O23 , or Pagel's method to determine the chemical\nabundances of objects where no auroral lines could be observed and, hence, no temperature could be determined. At present, more than a dozen strong-line indicators have been\nproposed; of them, the most studied is R23 (e.g. Stasi\u0144ska 2006; Kewley & Ellison 2008;\nL\u00f3pez-S\u00e1nchez et al. 2012). These strong-line indicators can be calibrated using well known\nabundance determinations such as the ones based on the Te (4363/5007) method or from\nfitting lines with numerical photoionization models.\nThe quality of the abundances derived with the Te (4363/5007) method, strongly depends on the validity of the assumption of constant temperature over the observed value. In\nthe presence of large thermal inhomogeneities, the Te (4363/5007) method will underestimate\nabundances since the temperature dependence of the intensity of collisionally excited lines\n(such as [O III] \u03bb\u03bb 4363, 4959, and 5007) is very different from that of the recombination line\n\u22121/2\nH\u03b2. The intensity of collisionally excited lines is proportional to I \u221d Te \u00d7exp(\u2212\u2206 E/kTe ),\nwhile the intensity of H\u03b2 is proportional to I \u221d Te\u22120.87 , where Te is the local electron temperature, k is the Boltzmann constant, and \u2206 E is the collisional energy required to excite the\nline. As an alternative to avoid the problem of the large temperature dependence of collisionally excited lines, recombination lines can be used to determine abundances and calibrate\nthe R23 \u2013 O/H diagram because they have a temperature dependence given approximately\nby I \u221d Te\u22121 . For recombination line to H\u03b2 ratios, the temperature dependence almost\ncancels out, whereas for collisionally excited line to H\u03b2 ratios the temperature dependence\ndoes not cancel out. Some work has been done in the upper branch of the diagram using\nrecombination lines, however, these faint lines can only be observed in metal-rich objects.\nThe discrepancy between abundances determined using recombination lines and collisionally excited lines is called the abundance discrepancy factor, ADF, problem. Typical values for H II regions lie in the 1.5 to 3 range (Peimbert et al. 1993, 2005; Garc\u0131\u0301a-Rojas & Esteban\n2007; Peimbert et al. 2007; Esteban et al. 2009, and references therein). There have been\ntwo major explanations for this discrepancy: (i) high metallicity inclusions that will create\ncool high density regions surrounded by hot low density regions (e.g. Tsamis & P\u00e9quignot\n2005), and (ii) thermal inhomogeneities in a chemically homogeneous medium that are caused\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nby various physical processes such as shadowed regions, advancing ionization fronts, shock\nwaves, magnetic reconnection, etc. (e.g. Peimbert & Peimbert 2011). Since the densities\ndetermined from oxygen recombination lines correlate very well with the [Cl III] densities\n(Peimbert & Peimbert 2005), we prefer the second explanation.\nIn Section 2 we discuss the corrections due to thermal inhomogeneities and due to the\nfraction of O depleted into dust grains. In Section 3 we present a quantitative correction\nto the Te (4363/5007) method, this correction is applied to the R23 method in Section 4. In\nSection 5 we discuss the relation between the O++ fraction and the intensity of the [O II]\nand [O III] nebular lines. Finally, in Section 6 we present the conclusions.\n\n2.\n\nTemperature Inhomogeneities and Dust\n\nThe formalism to study the chemical abundances in the presence of thermal inhomogeneities was introduced by Peimbert (1967) and Peimbert & Costero (1969), where the\nparameter that characterizes such thermal inhomogeneities was defined as t2 . In these works\nit was recognized that thermal inhomogeneities would produce systematic differences in temperatures determined from different methods, and that abundances determined with each\none of those temperatures would also present systematic differences. The abundances determined using the Te (4363/5007) method were approximately a factor of 2.5 lower than those\ndetermined using the same collsionally excited line intensities including the effect of thermal\ninhomogeneities.\nThere are several ways to obtain a t2 value, six of them are discussed in Peimbert & Peimbert\n(2011). These are based on the comparison of: (i) the O++ abundances obtained using [O III]\nlines versus abundances obtained using O II lines; (ii) the temperature derived from He I\nlines versus the temperatures derived from [O II] and [O III] lines; (iii) the temperatures\nderived from the ratio of the Balmer and Paschen continua to the Balmer line intensities\nversus the temperatures derived from [O II] and [O III] lines; (iv) the C++ abundances derived using [C III] and C III] lines versus abundances obtained from C II lines; (v) 1.5\u00d7106\ncolumnar temperatures determined from a high spatial resolution map of the Orion nebula\n(O'Dell et al. 2003); and (vi) the calibrations of the R23 method using observations versus\nthose using photoionization models. In all cases, the t2 values are consistent with each other,\nwhich implies that those objects are chemically homogeneous. The first two methods are the\nmost used to determine t2 .\nIndependently of the effects of the thermal structure, there is an additional correction due to dust depletion that should be taken into account to determine abundances.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nEsteban et al. (1998) found that the depletion of oxygen into dust grains in the Orion nebula\namounted to a 0.08 dex correction in the O/H ratio; slightly higher estimates of this correction have been found in recent studies of the Orion nebula (Mesa-Delgado et al. 2009b;\nSim\u00f3n-D\u0131\u0301az & Stasi\u0144ska 2011). From the depletion of Mg, Si, and Fe in Galactic and extragalactic H II regions, Peimbert & Peimbert (2010) estimated an O/H correction ranging\nfrom 0.09 to 0.11 dex that increases with increasing O/H ratios. We have used the correction\nrecommended by Peimbert et al. for all the objects of our sample; this corrections amounts to\n0.11 dex for those objects whose gaseous oxygen abundance is 12+log(O/H)> 8.3, 0.10 dex\nfor objects with 8.3 >12+log(O/H)> 7.8, and 0.09 for those objects with 7.8 >12+log(O/H).\n\n3.\n\nCorrection to the abundances derived with the Te (4363/5007) method\n\nDue to the inconsistencies presented when comparing abundances obtained with the\nTe (4363/5007) method and those obtained with, recombination lines, photoionization models, and using abundances of recently formed stars; it is clear that abundances derived from\nthe Te (4363/5007) method are systematically underestimated. This needs to be corrected\nby considering the thermal structure of the object and the fraction of oxygen depleted into\ndust grains.\nTable 1 lists the sample we used to correct the Te (4363/5007) method. The sample\nconsists on six H II galaxies, eight Galactic H II regions, and 14 extragalactic H II regions.\nThis total of 28 objects were gathered from the literature and, in each of them, at least one\nvalue of t2 was obtained. For the cases where there was more than one t2 value we took the\none presented as average or the one from the brightest observed region.\n\nBased on detailed analysis presented in the literature it follows that the total oxygen abundance should be higher due to the effects of the thermal structure on the emitted\nspectra (e.g. Peimbert 1967; Peimbert & Costero 1969; Peimbert et al. 2000; Peimbert 2003;\nGarc\u0131\u0301a-Rojas et al. 2004; Esteban et al. 2005; Peimbert et al. 2007; Esteban et al. 2009; Peimbert & Peimbe\n2011; Pe\u00f1a-Guerrero et al. 2012; Peimbert et al. 2012) and that the fraction of O depleted\ninto dust grains should be taken into account (Peimbert & Peimbert 2010, see also section\n2). We expect the magnitude of these effects to depend on the oxygen abundance and,\npossibly, on the oxygen excitation degree. In order to take these factors into account, we\nconsidered that the abundances derived from the Te (4363/5007) method should be corrected\nwith a function f dependent on the oxygen ionization degree and on the oxygen abundance\ndetermined from the Te (4363/5007) method, (O/H)4363/5007 :\n(O/H)CALM = (O/H)4363/5007 + f (P, (O/H)4363/5007 ),\n\n(1)\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nwhere CALM stands for Corrected Auroral Line Method. Throughout this paper all oxygen\nabundances are given in units of 12+log(O/H).\nAs a first approximation to the function f , we decided to use a linear correction of the\nform\nf (P, (O/H)4363/5007 ) = C1 + C2 \u00d7 (O/H)4363/5007 + C3 \u00d7 P + C4 \u00d7 P \u00d7 (O/H)4363/5007 , (2)\nwhere C1 , C2 , C3 , and C4 are constants.\nAll abundances determined for our sample were corrected for (i) the presence of thermal inhomogeneities and (ii) the fraction of oxygen depleted into dust grains. We have\nfound that the difference between these corrected abundances and those determined with\nthe Te (4363/5007) method lie in the 0.16 to 0.40 dex range.\nWe found very little dependence with oxygen degree of ionization: C3 and C4 are 0.010\nand 0.0002, respectively. Since the dependence with ionization degree is small and consistent\nwith zero we will ignore it. Figure 1 presents the oxygen abundance correction dependence\nwith oxygen abundance for the objects of our sample. The best fit is obtained with C1 and\nC2 equal to \u22120.375 and 0.0825, respectively:\nf (P, (O/H)4363/5007 ) = f ((O/H)4363/5007 ) = 0.0825(O/H)4363/5007 \u2212 0.375;\n\n(3)\n\nthis implies a corrected oxygen abundance:\n(O/H)CALM = 1.0825(O/H)4363/5007 \u2212 0.375.\n\n(4)\n\nThe points in Figure 1 show considerable dispersion; this is not surprising, because (i) the\nerrors in the determination of each t2 value are large and (ii) the true value of t2 for each\nobject depends on the details of the object (see Figure 4 of Peimbert et al. 2012). To test\nfor the statistical significance of this correlation we calculated a Spearman's correlation\nstatistic of \u03c1 = 0.3685, this suggests that the correlation is real with 95% confidence. When\ncomparing the dispersion with the uncertainties on the oxygen abundance determinations\nfor this sample we calculated \u03c72 = 60.28; showing that about half of this dispersion comes\nfrom the uncertainties of the determination of t2 ; meaning that approximately half of the\ndispersion comes from the unique physical conditions of each object.\n\n4.\n\nRecalibration of the R23 Abundance Determination Method\n\nR23 is now being widely used to determine abundances in objects with low intrinsic\nbrightness or objects with low to intermediate redshift (z up to 1). The R23 method remains\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\none of the most popular strong line indicators because (i) it is based directly on oxygen lines,\n(ii) it includes lines from the 2 relevant ionization stages, (iii) the lines it uses are the most\nintense for most H II regions, and (iv) these lines lie in the blue part of the spectrum and\ncan be observed from the ground for higher redshifts than other methods.\nUnfortunately, the curve in the R23 \u2013 O/H diagram is double valued (see Figure 2); this\noccurs because: at low metallicities, the main cooler in H II regions is the hydrogen atom;\nwith increasing element abundances, the cooling due to oxygen nebular lines increases, hence,\nthe value of R23 increases reaching a maximum value of R23 \u2248 10 when 12+log(O/H)ISM \u2248\n8.4; then, at higher metallicities, the IR [O III], IR [Ne II], and optical [N II] lines begin\nto dominate the cooling so that the total value of R23 decreases as the metallicity increases\n(Van Zee et al. 1998).\nAlso, there is a noticeable dependence on the oxygen ionization degree (e.g. McGaugh\n1991; Kewley & Dopita 2002). In a series of articles Pilyugin (2000, 2001) and Pilyugin & Thuan\n(2005), presented an analytic family of curves for each branch of the R23 \u2013 O/H diagram. This\nfamily of curves depends on the oxygen excitation degree across the object; defining the P\nparameter as the observable oxygen excitation ratio, P =([O III] 4959+5007)/([O II] 3727 +\n[O III] 4959+5007), and presenting two equations to determine the upper and lower branch\nabundances as a function of (O/H)P =f (P ,R23 ). This calibration is based on abundances\ndetermined using the Te (4363/5007) method.\nUnfortunately, depending on the calibration, resultant O/H values can vary by as much\nas 0.6 dex (Peimbert et al. 2007; Kewley & Ellison 2008). This large dispersion in the calibrations mainly comes from what was chosen to be adjusted: (i) the theoretical intensities given\nby photoionization models, (ii) abundances derived from the Te (4363/5007) method, or (iii)\nabundances derived from observations of oxygen recombination lines. The lowest determinations for the gaseous oxygen abundances are those that come from using the Te (4363/5007)\nmethod, therefore they require the correction due to thermal inhomogeneities; additionally,\nto obtain the total oxygen abundances, a correction of \u223c 0.10 dex -due O depletion into\ndust grains- is required.\nWe find that, among all the calibrations of the R23 \u2013 O/H diagram available in the\nliterature, the one presented by Pilyugin & Thuan (2005) is the most adequate for this work\nsince it explicitly includes the oxygen ionization degree through the P parameter.\nThe calibration of Pilyugin & Thuan (2005), (O/H)P , used abundances that were determined with the Te (4363/5007) method; hence, abundances are underestimated but this\nallows us to use equation 4 to correct them since (O/H)P has abundances determined with the\nTe (4363/5007) method at its core. We can determine oxygen abundances from a recalibration\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nof the R23 method, (O/H)RRM , by substituting (O/H)RRM and (O/H)P in place of (O/H)CALM\nand (O/H)4363/5007 into equation (4). We take (O/H)P from equation [22] and [24] of Pilyugin\nand Thuan for the upper and lower branches, respectively, to obtain two recalibrated families\nof curves that now simultaneously consider the thermal structure, the ionization structure,\nand the depleted fraction of O into dust grains. The oxygen abundance for the upper branch\n(which shifted from 12+log(O/H)P \u22658.25 up to 12+log(O/H)RRM \u22658.55), can be estimated\nfrom:\n\n(O/H)RRM\n\nR23 + 726.1 + 8.42P + 327.5P 2\n=\n85.96 + 82.76P + 43.98P 2 + 1.793R23\nR23 + 1837 + 2146P + 850P 2\n,\n=\n209.5 + 201.7P + 107.2P 2 + 4.37R23\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n1.0825 \u2212 0.375\n(5)\n\nwhile the oxygen abundance for the lower branch (which shifted from 12+log(O/H)P \u22648.00\nup to 12+log(O/H)RRM \u22648.29), can be estimated from:\n\n(O/H)RRM\n\nR23 + 106.4 + 106.8P \u2212 3.40P 2\n=\n17.72 + 6.60P + 6.95P 2 \u2212 0.302R23\nR23 + 90.73 + 94.58P \u2212 5.26P 2\n.\n=\n14.81 + 5.52P + 5.81P 2 \u2212 0.252R23\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n1.0825 \u2212 0.375\n(6)\n\nFigure 2 shows these recalibrations of the upper and lower branches for different oxygen\nionization degrees, while Figure 3 compares the calibration presented in this work and that\nof Pilyugin & Thuan (2005) to the data from Table 1.\n\n5.\n\nO\n\n++\n\nThe O++ fraction\n\nSomething missing when using the P parameter is a quantitative connection with the\nfraction in the nebulae. We will define the O++ ionization degree as:\nR\nne n(O++ )dr\nOID = R\n.\n(7)\nne n(O+ + O++ )dr\n\nSince there is a tight relationship between the parameter P and the O++ ionization\ndegree (see Figure 4), the fraction of O++ in the object can be estimated through the the\nfollowing equation:\nOID = 0.9821P \u2212 0.0048.\n(8)\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nThis equation allows us to statistically estimate the O++ ionization degree directly from the\nobservable P without having to make a lengthy analysis of the ionic abundances. It should\nbe noted that while this relation shows no significant bias with the O/H ratio, more points\nare needed to confirm the lack of bias or to estimate the relevance of the oxygen abundance\nin this correlation.\n\n6.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe used a sample of 28 H II regions obtained from the literature, with t2 values ranging\nfrom 0.020 to 0.120, to present an important correction to the abundances derived with\nthe Te (4363/5007) method, as well as a recalibration of Pagel's strong-line method, R23 to\ndetermine chemical abundances. Both, the correction and the recalibration consider the\nthermal and ionization structure of the object, as well as the fraction of oxygen depleted\ninto dust grains. We found that the differences between the corrected abundances and those\ndetermined with the Te (4363/5007) method lie in the 0.22 to 0.35 dex range.\nAlmost all previous calibrations of the R23 \u2013 O/H diagram in the literature have considered a homogeneous temperature throughout the object. The recalibration presented in\nequations 5 and 6, is the first to simultaneously consider the thermal structure of the photoionized object, the ionization structure, and the correction due to the fraction of oxygen\ndepleted into dust grains. This recalibration is particularly useful for objects with low to\nintermediate redshifts (up to z \u2248 1).\nWe find that the O++ ionization degree shows a surprisingly almost one-to-one relation with the parameter P , thus ensuring that a calibration which considers P is directly\nconsidering the oxygen ionization structure of the object.\nGiven that all strong-line indicators attempt to determine the total oxygen abundance\nas means of estimating the heavy element content, and that all the observational calibrations\nhave been done using abundances determined with the Te (4363/5007) method, the oxygen\ncorrection presented in this paper should be used to recalibrate other strong-line indicators\nin the literature.\nThe up-shifting of the family of curves in the R23 \u2013 O/H diagram found in this work,\nhas important consequences in various areas of astrophysics such as the determination of:\ninitial mass functions, star formation rates, luminosity functions, yields, radial metallicity\ngradients of spiral galaxies, and chemical evolution models of the Universe.\nWe are grateful to an anonymous referee for a careful reading of the manuscript and\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nseveral useful suggestions.

For comparison we present representative bands\nof the upper and lower branches for both nebular line calibrations, (O/H)RRM (solid black\ncurves) and (O/H)P (point-dashed curves).\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- Linear relation found between the observational parameter P and the true O++\nionization degree. The objects used to obtain this relation are those listed in Table 1.\n\n\f"}
