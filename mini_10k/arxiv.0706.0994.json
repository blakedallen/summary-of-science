It is shown that the homogeneous state of the system is unstable and in the stationary state the densities of the\nelectron-hole plasma and exciton gas are modulated.\n\n1\n\n\fThe problem of the existence of the Bose condensed state of the exciton gas in semiconductors is the subject of the\nexperimental and theoretical investigations for a long time. However, there is no undoubted proof of the existence of\nthis state until now.\nRecently, the properties of the cold exciton gas are investigated intensively, both experimentally and theoretically,\nin double 2D quantum wells, besides, electrons are localized on one plane of these wells and the holes are localized\non the other plane. The state of the cold exciton system being observed in the experiments of different experimental\ngroups [1], [2], [3], [5], [8], [10], [11], [4], [6], [7] is nonhomogeneous, and the density of the system in these experiments\nis modulated in space.\nThe theory of this phenomenon based on the Turing kinetic mechanism of the instability [12] have been proposed in\nworks [8], [9]. In this theory the system of nonlinear diffusion equations with sources of particles for electrons, holes\nand excitons are proposed and solved. The solution of these equations demonstrates the state with the periodically\nmodulated density of the exciton system only if the constant describing the decay of excitons depends on their density.\nHowever, in the low density approximation this dependence should be neglected. Moreover, this mechanism has the\nclassical character and does not describe the systems with the quantum coherency, but for the sufficiently small\ntemperatures one can suppose the existence of the coherency in the exciton system [15], [16], [18].\nAnother theory, based on the supposition of the existence of the attraction between excitons at large distances and\nthe formation of the liquid phase in the low-density exciton system due to this attraction, has been proposed in the\nwork [13]. The supposition of the existence of the liquid phase in the low-density exciton system is baseless. The\nexistence of the attractive part of the interparticle interaction potential in 2D Bose systems results in the collapse of\nthe system to the densities of the order of the squared inverse radius of the repulsive core [? ]. However, for these\ndensities excitons can not exist as individual particles, they are destroyed and form the electron-hole liquid. Note that\nin the usual 3D case, as it was shown in the work [15], the scattering amplitude for the isotropic excitons is positive\nand is equal to the value a = 13\u03c0\n3 aB , where aB is the effective Bohr radius, and just the scattering amplitude, but not\nthe bare potential, determines the properties of the system in the case of small densities. The effective Bohr radius\n2\nmh\nis the reduced mass, me,h are electron (e)\nhas the form aB = m\u2217~(e\u2217 )2 ; where ~ is the Planck constant; m\u2217 = mmee+m\nh\nand hole (h) masses, which are supposed to be isotropic and of the same order me \u223c mh ; e\u2217 is the effective charge\n\u0010 2 \u00111/2\n; where e is the bare electron charge and \u03ba0 is the static dielectric constant of the\nin the semiconductor e\u2217 = \u03bae 0\nsemiconductor. As the result, the 3D exciton system of small density can exist only in the gas phase. The repulsion for\nthe interaction between excitons in 2D system, where electrons and holes are localized on different planes, is sharply\ndefined than in the usual 3D case due to the geometrical constraint. In this case the formation of the exciton liquid\nphase is possible only for the densities nex \u2265 1/a2ex , where aex is the size of the exciton. The size of the exciton is\nequal to the effective Bohr radius aex = aB in the case of the small distance l between the planes of the quantum wells\nl << aB , and aex >> aB for the large distance between planes when l >> aB . If the exciton density is sufficiently\nlarge nex \u2265 1/a2ex the excitons can not be considered as the individual particles. In this case the electron-hole system\nrepresents the strongly interacting electron-hole liquid.\nIn the present work the Coulomb correlations in the cold electron-hole plasma as well as the quantum effects and\nthe coherency of the exciton subsystem in quantum wells are taken into account. We suppose that the external source\nis stationary, has the frequency larger than the semiconductor gap \u2206g and creates electrons and holes being localized\non different planes. Moreover, the region of the action of the electromagnetic field is supposed to be sufficiently small.\nIn this case the electron-hole plasma being created by the external source propagates along 2D planes, besides, the\nelectrons propagate along one plane and the holes along the other plane. During this propagation the electron-hole\nplasma loses the energy giving away the energy to the phonon system and comes to the equilibrium state with the\nsmall temperature T. Note that the parameters of the stationary state, such that the densities of the electron-hole\nplasma n and the exciton gas nex , are defined by the equilibrium between incoming rate of the electrons, holes and\nexcitons and outgoing rate of these particles.\nThus, the model being analyzed represents the quasi-equilibrium electron-hole plasma from which the exciton gas is\ncreated as the result of the formation of the electron-hole bound states. In the present work we consider the properties\nof the stationary state of this system, namely, the properties of the electron-hole plasma of the small density na3B << 1\ninteracting with the exciton gas of small density nex a3B << 1.\nThe small density of the electron-hole plasma and the exciton gas are necessary if we suppose the existence both\nelectron-hole plasma and the exciton gas. In the opposite case of the large density na3B >> 1 the excitons are\ndestroyed and can not exist as the individual particles. This case is not under consideration in this work. Note that\nthe experiments [1], [5], [8] demonstrate the existence of the excitons, and this means the existence of small density\nof the electron-hole plasma in these experiments.\nWe analyze the correlation properties of the electron-hole plasma of the small density and the interaction of this\n2\n\n\fplasma with the exciton gas. The energy of the ground state of the electron-hole plasma has a minimum value as the\nfunction of the density at some density n0 such that n0 a2B \u223c 1. As a result, the electron-hole plasma tends to form\nthe liquid electron-hole drops and the homogeneous state of the system becomes unstable. The inhomogeneous state\nof the electron-hole plasma creates the periodic mean field which acts on the exciton gas and makes the density of\nthe exciton system modulated in space.\nWe suppose that the system consisting of the electron-hole plasma interacting with the exciton gas is in the\n(e,h)\n(ex)\n(e,h)\nstationary state with some small temperature T obeying the inequality T << \u03b5F\n<< Eb ; where \u03b5F\nare the\n(e,h)\n\nFermi energies of the electrons and the holes correspondingly \u03b5F\n\n=\n\np2F\n2me,h ;\n\nthe Fermi momentum pF in 2D case is\n\n1/2\n\nexpressed by the equality pF = (2\u03c0n) ; the average density n of the electron-hole plasma is equal to the density of\n2\n(ex)\n(ex)\neach component n = ne = nh ; Eb\nis the exciton bound energy Eb = 2m~\u2217 a2 . Below we use the system of units in\nB\nwhich ~ = m\u2217 = e\u2217 = 1.\nEFFECTIVE ACTION\n\nTo analyze the properties of the exciton system interacting with the electron-hole plasma the effective action for the\nslow fields is derived. In this paper the properties of the stationary state of this system is under consideration, but in\nfuture the kinetics of the formation of this state is supposed to be analyzed. For this reason the Keldysh-Schwinger\ntechnique for the nonequilibrium processes [17], [19] in the functional integral formulation (see [20], for example) is\nused for the derivation of the effective action of the slow fields.

In this paper we give more simple derivation of the effective action and\nintroduce some simplification transforming to the density functional for the Fermi subsystem. Integrating over the\nrapid \u03c8\u03b1 -fields, changing on the scale much smaller than the average distance between the charge carriers n\u22121/3 , in\nthe ladder approximation we can obtain the action for the smooth fields in the form\n\n(s)\n\nSeh =\n\nI\n\nd3 xd3 x\u2032\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\nX\n\n\u03c8 \u03b1 (i\u2202t \u2212 \u03be\u03b1 ) \u03c8\u03b1 \u03b4 (x \u2212 x\u2032 ) \u2212\n\n\u0001 \u03b1=e,h\n\u0001\n1\nbC \u03c8 e \u03c8e \u2212 \u03c8 h \u03c8h \u03b4 (t \u2212 t\u2032 ) \u2212\n\uf8f4\n\u2212\nU\n\u03c8\n\u03c8\n\u2212\n\u03c8\n\u03c8\ne\nh\n\uf8f4\nh\n\uf8f3 2 e\n\n1\n2\n\nX\n\n\u03b1,\u03b2=e,h\n\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fd\n\n\u03c8 \u03b1 \u03c8\u03b1 \u0393\u03b1\u03b2 \u03c8 \u03b2 \u03c8\u03b2 \uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\n\n(3)\n\nhere the fields \u03c8\u03b1 are the smooth Fermi fields.

The formation of the inhomogeneous state of the low density electronhole plasma is the result of the tendency of the low density plasma to collapse to the liquid electron-hole drops. The\ninteraction of this plasma with the exciton gas results in the existence of the self-consistent nonhomogeneous periodic\nfield acting on the exciton system as the periodic external field. This periodic field results in the density modulation\nof the exciton system.\n\u0010 \u2192\n\u2212\u0011\nTo analyze the effective action for simplicity we put m = me = mh = 1.

(23) it can be seen that the system is unstable relative to the phonon oscillations\nof the electron-hole \u0001plasma density. The sound velocity of the density oscillations has the imaginary value | c |2 =\n4\u03c0\n\u22122/3\nVF2 . Note that the sound character of the considering density fluctuations is not surprising, since\n9 A< n>\nthese fluctuations do not violate the electro-neutrality of the electron-hole plasma. This instability results in the\ngrowth of the density fluctuations of the plasma with the increment of the growth\n\n\u03b6=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u00131/2\n4\u03c0\nA\n< n >\u22121/3 kVF \u223c k < n >1/6 >> kVF\n9\n\nThis increment of the growth corresponds to the frequency which is much larger than kVF , \u03b6 >> kVF . Due to\n2\nthis inequality we can use the asymptotic of the polarization operator \u03a0(0) (\u03c9, k) \u223c (kV\u03c9F2 ) being correct for the large\nfrequencies \u03c9 >> kVF .\nAs the result, the stationary state of the electron-hole plasma should be nonhomogeneous, besides, the modulation\nof the density has the periodic character.\nThe modulated density of the electron-hole plasma results in the existence of the self-consistent field acting on the\nexciton system. This field has the form (23)\n\u2212\n\u2192\nV (\u2192\nr ) = \u03b3ex\u2212e,h \u2206n (\u2212\nr)\nNote that this external for the exciton system potential plays the essential role, if the amplitude of this potential is\nlarger than the chemical potential of the exciton gas. This condition can be obeyed for the sufficiently large density\nof the electron-hole plasma, i.e., for the sufficiently large pump.\nAt the conclusion we estimate the radius of the character non-homogeneity of the electron-hole plasma from the\nkinetic consideration [22]. We suppose that the kinetics of the non-homogeneity formation is analogous to the kinetics\nof the electron-hole liquid drop formation or the phase immiscibility and can be described by the equation\n\u0001\nn0\n\u2202t \u03c0R2 n0 = 2\u03c0RVF n + 2\u03c0RVex nex \u2212 \u03c0R2\n\u03c4\n\n(24)\n\nThe first term in the right hand side of the equation (24) is the incoming term and the second one is the outgoing\nterm; VF n is the current of Fermi particles incoming into the drop of the radius R; Vex nex is\u221athe current of excitons\n\u03b3 nex\nincoming into the drop, Vex is the average velocity of excitons which can be written as Vex \u223c ex\n; n is the density\nm\nof the electron-hole plasma in the gas phase, nex is the density of excitons, and n0 is the density of the electron-hole\nliquid within the drop; \u03c4 is the lifetime of the carriers. There are no vapor terms in Eq.(24) since T=0, and particles\ncan not overcome work function from the liquid drop. The equilibrium value of the radius R can be found from\nEq.(24) as\n\nR0 = 2\n\nVF n + Vex nex\n\u03c4\nn0\n\n(25)\n\nNote that the radiuses larger than R0 are not profitable due to the different dependence on R of the incoming and\noutgoing terms - the first one is the surface term and the second one has the volume character. From the point of\n8\n\n\fview of the phase immiscibility the liquid phase is the electron-hole liquid drops and the gas phase is the mixture of\nthe exciton gas and the electron-hole plasma of the small density.\nFinally, the set of drops forms the periodic structure. We suppose that this is the consequence of the homogeneity\nof the system in average. This periodic structure forms the external periodic field for the exciton gas. If this Bose\ngas could be considered as the ideal, it should be localized at the minima of the periodic external potential.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n\nL.V.
