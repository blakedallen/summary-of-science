In [Ham07], Hamilton\nproposed the extension of \u015anyaticki's definition to the case with singular fibers by also considering\nthe higher cohomology of the same sheaf of polarized smooth sections of the prequantization bundle.\nHis results show, however, that the formalism will have to be modified in order to obtain the\nexpected quantization even in the case of the harmonic oscillator. Indeed, for singularities of\nelliptic type (like in the case of toric varieties) Hamilton obtains states corresponding only to nonsingular Bohr\u2013Sommerfeld leaves. In the toric case, these correspond to interior integral points\nof the moment polytope. If one doesn't take into account the half-form correction, however, one\nexpects the quantization to include all states corresponding to the integral points of the polytope,\nincluding those on the boundary. Only in this way, for the compact case, does one get the same\ndimension of the space of quantum states as for the holomorphic polarizations.\nIn [BFMN11], a solution of this problem was proposed within the context of toric varieties\nwithout the half-form correction. The real polarized sections are defined directly as distributional\nsolutions of the equations of covariant constancy and can also be obtained by degenerating appropriately normalized K\u00e4hler polarized sections. These normalized holomorphic sections converge,\nunder the degeneration, to Dirac-delta-distributional sections supported on the Bohr\u2013Sommerfeld\n\n2\n\n\ffibers which correspond to integral points of the moment polytope, including the ones on the boundary. The corresponding Bohr\u2013Sommerfeld orbits are increasingly singular (lower dimensional) as\nthe codimension of the face of the polytope on which they are increases.\nOn the other hand, one would expect these quantum states not to be present in a quantization\nin the real toric polarization correctly reproducing the \"vacuum energy shift\" of the harmonic\noscillator. We show that this expected behavior of the quantum states is precisely achieved by\nour definition of the half-form corrected K\u00e4hler quantizations deforming continuously to the real\npolarization.\nAn immediate obstacle to defining the half-form quantization in a K\u00e4hler polarization is the\nfact that the canonical bundle KX of a toric variety may not admit\na square root, for instance for\n\u221a\n2n\nCP . (See the appendix for a discussion of the existence of KX in terms of the fan of X.) In\nSection 3, we consider K\u00e4hler quantization of a compact toric manifold X with symplectic structure\nc1 (X)\n\u03c9 such that [\u03c9]\n\u2208 H 2 (X, Z) and is nonnegative. (This integrality condition has also been\n2\u03c0 \u2212\n2\nproposed in [C78].) In the case when c1 (X) is even, so that KX admits a square root, one is then\nreduced to the usual setting for half-form quantization. Let L \u2192 X be an hermitian line bundle\ni\nwith connection of curvature given by\n\u221a \u2212i\u03c9 + 2 \u03c1, where \u03c1 is the Ricci form for the K\u00e4hler metric on\nX, so that [\u03c1/2\u03c0] \u2208 c1 (X). When a KX exists, this corresponds to taking the usual prequantum\nconnection\nplus one-half the Chern\u2013Levi\u2013Civita connection on KX , which gives a connection on\n\u221a\nKX .\nc1 (X)\nThe condition [\u03c9]\n\u2208 H 2 (X, Z) allows us to choose the moment polytope (see equations\n2\u03c0 \u2212\n2\n(3.6) and (3.7) in Section 3.2), PX = \u03bc(X),\nPX = {x \u2208 Rn : lj (x) = \u03bdj * x + \u03bbj \u2265 0, j = 1, . . . , r} ,\nwith all \u03bbj 's half-integral\n\n1\n+ Z, j = 1 . . . , r,\n2\nwhere x are action coordinates and \u03bdj is the primitive inward pointing normal vector to the j-th\nfacet. With this choice, there are no integral points in the boundary of PX and to all integral\npoints inside PX there will correspond K\u00e4hler polarized states, that is holomorphic sections of L.\nUnlike Hamilton's case however, the integral points start at lattice distance 1/2 (rather than 1),\nfrom every facet (see the figures in Remarks 3.7 and 3.8.)\nAs in the case without the half-form correction, these polarized states will converge, as the\npolarizations degenerate to the toric real polarization, to delta distributions supported on the\ncorresponding non-singular orbits. The degeneration of the equations for polarized sections (see\nsection 4.2) is also consistent with the degeneration of the polarized states as the Ricci connection\nterm id\u03b8vj in (4.2) corresponds to a connection with curvature supported on the inverse image\nof the j-th facet by the moment map. From the point of view of the real polarization these\nsingular connections are responsible for the vacuum energy shifts (which correspond to shifted Bohr\u2013\nSommerfeld conditions) as they prevent the existence of covariantly constant sections supported on\nthe boundary. Quantization in the real singular toric polarization is then defined directly in terms\nof this limit connection. This provides an approach for defining half-form corrected quantization\nin real singular polarizations. By finding the type of singularities of the half-form corrected limit\nconnection, one finds corrected equations for the real polarized sections. In the toric case, this\ndirect approach for the definition of the half-form corrected quantization in the singular toric real\npolarization gives the same results as the degeneration of K\u00e4hler polarizations (Theorems 4.7 and\n4.15).\nIn [BFMN11], the convergence to delta-distributions was achieved by taking L1 -normalized\nsections. In the present paper, however, the half-form correction ensures the nice behavior of the\n\u03bbj \u2208\n\n3\n\n\fL2 -normalized sections in the limit of degenerating complex structure. This is in agreement with\nother examples such as finite-dimensional vector spaces [KW06] and abelian varieties [BMN10].\nOne of the primary motivations for including the half-form correction is that it allows for a\ncanonical pairing between quantizations associated to different complex structures. This pairing\nis known as the Blattner\u2013Konstant\u2013Sternberg (BKS) pairing. The BKS pairing between quantizations associated to two K\u00e4hler complex structures is nondegenerate, and hence (since the K\u00e4hler\nquantizations of a compact toric manifold are finite dimensional) induces an isomorphism between\nthem. One does not, though, expect in general that the BKS pairing provides a unitary identification of quantizations associated to different complex structures. In several common cases, for\nexample for symplectic vector spaces equipped with translation invariant K\u00e4hler structures, and for\ncomplex Lie groups equipped with certain families of K\u00e4hkler structures (which include the canonical K\u00e4hler structure), the BKS pairing is unitary (see [Hal02], [KW06],[FMMN05],[FMMN06]). In\na few other cases, the BKS pairing is known to be not unitary, for example for T \u2217 S 2 [Raw79]. In\nmost cases, it is not known whether the BKS pairing is unitary, and conditions for unitarity do\nnot yet seem to be well understood. We show that the BKS pairing between half-form corrected\nquantizations of compact toric varieties is not unitary in general.\nWe will also consider another method for comparing quantizations associated to different complex structures. Namely, one can construct a (finite-rank) Hilbert bundle over the space of toric\ncomplex structures on X with the fiber at a point being the quantum Hilbert space associated\nto that complex structure. When the half-form correction is not included, the quantum Hilbert\nbundle is a subbundle of a trivial bundle, and hence carries a canonical connection obtained by\northogonal projection of the trivial connection. This connection is called the quantum connection.\nIt was first introduced and studied by Axelrod, della Pietra and Witten in [APW91] and, from\na slightly different point of view, by Hitchin in [Hit90]. See also [AGL07] for a treatment which\nincludes the half-form correction.\nFor linear complex structures on a symplectic vector space, the quantum connection turns out\nto be projectively flat, which means that up to a constant, one may identify all K\u00e4hler quantizations\nat once. To extend the connection to the boundary of the space of complex structures, and thus\nstudy their degenerations and relate real quantizations to K\u00e4hler quantizations, one must introduce\nthe half-form correction; parallel transport of the resulting corrected quantum connection, still\nin the case of linear complex structures, was studied by the first author and Wu in [KW06],\nwhere it was found that parallel transport along geodesics with internal endpoints is just rescaled\nBergman projection, while transport along geodesics with one or two endpoints on the boundary\nyields the well-known Segal\u2013Bargmann and Fourier transforms, respectively. These results were\nrecently extended by Wu to the case of linear quantization of fermions [Wu10]. In the usual\n(bosonic) case, one may then quotient by the action of Z2n , as done by Baier and the second\ntwo authors in [BMN10], to study degenerations of complex structures on abelian varieties at the\nlevel of \u03b8-functions. In a different direction, in [FMMN05] and [FMMN06], Florentino, Matias and\nthe second two authors studied the corrected quantum connection on a one-dimensional family of\ncomplex structures on the complexification of a compact Lie group which degenerates to the vertical\npolarization of the cotangent bundle of the underlying real Lie group; here, again, parallel transport\nwith respect to the quantum connection yields the (generalized) Segal\u2013Bargmann\u2013Hall transform.\nIn related work, Lempert and Sz\u0151ke have recently studied the bundle of quantizations associated to\na family of adapted-type complex structures on Grauert tubes of compact, real-analytic Riemannian\nmanifolds [LS10], although they use a Chern-type connection rather than the BKS construction\nconsidered here.\nIn Subsection 5.3, we show that the quantum connection on the quantum Hilbert bundle induced\nby the BKS pairing is flat, so that the quantizations associated to different torus-invariant complex\nstructures can be canonically identified.\n4\n\n\f2\n2.1\n\nPreliminaries.\nComplex line bundles\n\nWe begin with some facts about complex line bundles. Let E \u2192 X be a complex line bundle on a\nmanifold X and let E0 = E \\ {zero section} be its frame bundle.

Following\n[Wei04] we call the line bundle E U (1) the unitarization of E.\nThis isomorphism is given explicitly by\n\u001a\n|l| \u2297 lU (1) , l 6= 0\nEp \u220b l 7\u2192\n0,\nl = 0,\n\nwhere p \u2208 X, |l| = [(l, 1)]|*| = [(lc\u22121 , |c|)]|*| \u2208 |E| = E0 \u00d7(C\u2217 ,|*|) C and lU (1) = [(l, 1)]arg =\nc\n)]arg \u2208 E u(1) = E0 \u00d7(C\u2217 ,arg) C, c \u2208 C\u2217 .\n[(lc\u22121 , |c|\n\nFor simplicity, we will identify E with |E| \u2297 E U (1) and write 0 6= l = |l| \u2297 lU (1) = |l|lU (1) and\nthus, also, lU (1) = |l|l .\nLet {g\u03b1\u03b2 } be the transition functions for E associated to local trivializations for some open\ncover {U\u03b1 } of X. Then, for the same open cover {U\u03b1 }, the complex line bundle E U (1) has U (1)valued transition functions {g\u03b1\u03b2 / |g\u03b1\u03b2 |}, and the complex line bundle |E| has R+ -valued transition\nfunctions {|g\u03b1\u03b2 |}.\nThis decomposition of E = |E| \u2297 E U (1) induces an associated splitting of connections. Let \u2207\nbe a connection on E with connection form \u0398 associated to a local trivializing section s, \u2207s = \u0398s.\nSince, at the level of Lie algebras, the isomorphism C\u2217 \u223c\n= R+ \u00d7 U (1) gives C \u223c\n= R \u2295 iR, we have\nU (1)\nU (1)\n|E|\nE\n|E|\nE\n= i Im \u0398 are the connection forms for |E|, E U (1)\nwhere \u0398 = Re \u0398 and \u0398\n\u2207 = \u2207 +\u2207\nassociated to the local trivializing sections |s|, sU (1) respectively:\n\u2207E\n\n\u2207|E||s| = Re \u0398 |s|\n\nU (1)\n\nsU (1) = i Im \u0398 sU (1) .\n\nNow let E have an hermitian structure h. Then |E| has a global trivializing section \u03bch defined\nas follows. Let s be any local trivializing section of E over an open set U \u2282 X. Over U , define\n\u03bch = p\n\n|s|\n.\nh(s, s)\n\n(2.1)\n\nNotice that, since h is an hermitian structure, \u03bch is independent of the choice of the local trivializing\nsection s and therefore extends to a global trivializing section of |E|.\nLet \u0393(E) denote the space of smooth sections of E. A connection \u2207 on (E, h) \u2192 X is said\nto be compatible with the hermitian structure if for any section s \u2208 \u0393(E), one has dh(s, s) =\nh(\u2207s, s) + h(s, \u2207s). Let ||s||2 = h(s, s). This property is equivalent to d||s|| = Re \u0398||s|| which is,\nin turn, equivalent to\n\u2207|E| \u03bch = 0.\n5\n\n\fRemark 2.1 The above isomorphism of |E| with the \u221a\ntrivial bundle also defines, since E = |E| \u2297\nh(l,l)\nU\n(1)\nU\n(1)\n\u2666\nE\n, an isomorphism of E with E\ngiven by l 7\u2192 l |l| , l \u2208 E.\nRemark 2.2 If X is a complex manifold and if E has an holomorphic structure, then given a\nglobal nonzero meromorphic section of E, s, one has \u03bch = \u221a |s| away from the divisor of s. This\nh(s,s)\n\nexpression extends uniquely to \u03bch on the whole of X.\n\n\u2666\n\nAny line bundle E U (1) has a canonical hermitian structure defined by e\nh(zlU (1) , z \u2032 lU (1) ) = zz\u0304 \u2032 .\nThis hermitian structure is independent of the choice of representative l and is therefore well defined.\nRemark 2.3 An hermitian line bundle (E, h) \u2192 X can then be decomposed into smooth hermitian line bundles (E, h) = (|E| , b\nh) \u2297 (E U (1) , e\nh). The hermitian structure on |E| is defined by\n\u2032\n\u2032\nb\nh(z|l|, z |l|) = h(l, l)zz\u0304 , so that\nh(zl, z \u2032 l) = zz\u0304 \u2032 b\nh(|l|, |l|) * e\nh(lU (1) , lU (1) ) = zz\u0304 \u2032 b\nh(|l|, |l|), z, z \u2032 \u2208 C, l \u2208 E.\n\n\u2666\n\nRemark 2.4 Note that under the isomorphism |E| \u2243 X \u00d7 C defined by \u03bch , the hermitian form b\nh\nbecomes the standard hermitian product on C.\n\u2666\nWe recall the following standard results (see, for instance, Proposition 4.2.14 in [Huy05]):\nLemma 2.5 If (E, h) \u2192 X is a complex hermitian vector bundle, then there exists a compatible\nconnection \u2207. Moreover, \u2207\u2032 is another compatible connection if and only if there exists a (global)\nreal-valued 1-form \u03b2 such that \u2207\u2032 = \u2207 + i\u03b2.\nIf E \u2192 X is a holomorphic line bundle, then \u2202 \u0304 is a well-defined operator on \u0393(E). A connection\n \u0304\n\u2207 on E is said to be compatible with the holomorphic structure if \u22070,1 = \u2202.\nLemma 2.6 Let (E, h) \u2192 X be a hermitian holomorphic line bundle. There exists a unique\nconnection \u2207, called the Chern connection, which is compatible with both the hermitian structure\nh and the holomorphic structure of E. Moreover, if {U\u03b1 , s\u03b1 } is a holomorphic trivialization of E,\nthen \u2207s\u03b1 = (\u2202 log h(s\u03b1 , s\u03b1 )) s\u03b1 .\nThen, in the holomorphic local trivialization {U\u03b1 , s\u03b1 }, we have\nF\u2207 = d(\u2202 log h(s\u03b1 , s\u03b1 )) = \u2212\u2202 \u2202 \u0304 log h(s\u03b1 , s\u03b1 )\nthat is, \u2212 log h(s\u03b1 , s\u03b1 ) is a local potential for the curvature 2-form and, on the open set U\u03b1 ,\n \u0304 log h(s\u03b1 , s\u03b1 ))] \u2208 2\u03c0 * c1 (E).\n[i\u2202 \u2202(\u2212\nThe induced connections on |E| and E U (1) are then given by\n1\n\u2207|E| |s| = d log h(s, s) |s|,\n2\n\u0001\n1\nE U (1) U (1)\ns\n=\n\u2207\n\u2202 log h(s, s) \u2212 \u2202 \u0304 log h(s, s) sU (1) .\n2\n\nIf X is K\u00e4hler with integral symplectic form \u03c9 , and L is an hermitian holomorphic line bundle\nwith the curvature of the Chern connection given by \u2212i\u03c9, then in a local holomorphic trivialization\none has that \u03ba = \u2212 log h(s, s) is a local K\u00e4hler potential.\n6\n\n\f2.2\n\nToric Manifolds\n\nLet (X, \u03c9) be a compact smooth symplectic toric manifold with symplectic form \u03c9, moment map\n\u03bc : X \u2192 Lie(Tn )\u2217 \u2243 Rn and moment polytope PX = \u03bc(X) with associated fan \u03a3. The K\u00e4hler\nstructure of X, which connects the symplectomorphism class of X determined by PX to the biholomorphism class of X determined by \u03a3, is fixed by choosing a so-called symplectic potential. We\nwill find both descriptions, as well as the relation between them, essential for our work, and so we\ndescribe them briefly here (though we refer the interested reader to [Gui94], [Abr03], [CLS11] and\n[DP09] for details).\n2.2.1\n\nThe symplectic structure of X\n\nLet P\u030cX denote the interior of the moment polytope PX .

Since we assume X is\nsmooth, the polytope is regular; that is, there are n facets adjacent to each vertex, with normal\nvectors forming a Z-basis of Zn . Reorder (if necessary) the inequalities so that the first n correspond\nto the facets adjacent to v. Then l1 (v) = l2 (v) = * * * = ln (v) = 0. Let Av \u2208 GLn (Z) be the\nmatrix whose rows are the vectors \u03bdj , and let \u03bbv = t (\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn ).

Given a different vertex v \u2032 , with associated matrix Av\u2032 \u2208\nGLn (Z), and vector \u03bbv\u2032 , the transition functions between the corresponding vertex action angle\ncoordinates read\nxv \u2032\n\u03b8v \u2032\n\n= Av\u2032 A\u22121\nv (xv \u2212 \u03bbv ) + \u03bbv\u2032\n\n=\n\nt\n\nt\nAv \u03b8v .\nA\u22121\nv\u2032\n\n(2.5)\n\nFor a face F \u2282 PX (that is, a linear boundary component of any codimension, including the polytope\n\u02c7 = {v}\nitself, the facets and the edges), denote by F\u030c the interior of F , with the convention that {v}\nn\nfor vertices.

(In fact, if L is ample there is a bijection between the faces\nof PX and of PL . See Section 3.2.1 of [CK].) Let us denote by the same symbol v a vertex of\nPL and the corresponding vertex of PX . The holomorphic section corresponding to the vertex\nv of PL will provide a local trivializing section on the open set Uv , so that one obtains a global\nsystem of local holomorphic trivializations for L.

On the holomorphic vertex\nchart Uv this section is proportional to dWv /wv1 = dZv .\nSince the wvj 's are holomorphic coordinates on the chart Uv , it follows that a system of local\nholomorphic trivializations for KI is given by {(Uv , dWv )}.

We will describe in more detail the\nsingular behavior of the limiting connection at the end of this section.\n\u2666\nRemark 4.4 As explained in the previous section, we should think of L as the tensor product of\n\u221a U (1)\nK\n,\nthe uncorrected bundle l with the smooth bundle with U (1)-valued transition functions g\n\nthough in general these may not exist individually. On the other hand, the geometric quantization\nassociated to a polarization P is supposed to be the space of P-covariantly constant sections of the\ntensor product of the uncorrected bundle with the square root of the canonical bundle associated\nP. For the real polarization PR , the sections of the associated canonical bundle are n-forms of the\nform a(x)dx1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 dxn . Of course, the U (1)-part of this is hidden in the sections of L, and what\nis missing is the modulus of the square root of the canonical bundle associated to PR .\nTo put it another way, according to the standard procedures of\np geometric quantization, we\nQ\nshould actually define the quantization HR to be sections of L \u2297 |KPR |. Some care must be\n21\n\n\ftaken to interpret exactly what is meant by |Kp\nPR | (and hence what is meant by its square root).\nIn the next section, we will see p\nthat sections of |KPR | can be thought of as maps on the space of\nn-tuples of vector fields. Then, |KPR | admits a canonical section dX := dx1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 dxn on U0 , and\np\nQ\n0 otherwise. Hence, we should define HR\n= BRQ \u2297 |dX|. Of course, at this point, such a change\nis merely cosmetic. On the other hand, we will see in the next section that such expressions arise\nnaturally when studying the degenerations of the complex structure on X to the real polarization\nat the level of holomorphic sections.\n\u2666\nDefinition 4.5 The vector space of quantum states for the half-form corrected quantization of\n(X, \u03c9, L) in the toric polarization PR is defined by\np\nQ\nHR\n= BRQ \u2297 |dX|,\nwhere BRQ was defined in (4.4).\n\nQ\nRemark 4.6 A natural Hilbert space structure in HR\nwill be introduced in Section 4.3, via degeneration of K\u00e4hler quantizations of (X, \u03c9, L, I).\n\u2666\n\nThe open orbit U0 carries a free Tn -action which lifts to LU0 via geometric quantization. This\naction is generated by\n\u2207 \u2202 + ix.\n\u2202\u03b8\n\nU (1)\n10\n\nU (1)\n\nThen, the trivializing section\nis Tn -invariant and if \u03c4 \u2208 \u0393U0 (L) is given by \u03c4 = \u03c40 10\nfor\n\u221e\na smooth function \u03c40 \u2208 C (U0 ), we can decompose it into Fourier modes with respect to the\nTn -action. Specifically,\nX\n\u03c40 (x, \u03b8) =\ne\u2212im*\u03b8 \u03c4\u03020,m (x),\nR\n\nm\u2208Zn\n\n1\nim*\u03b8 \u03c4 (x, \u03b8)d\u03b8 is the m-th Fourier mode of \u03c4 .\nwhere \u03c4\u03020,m (x) = (2\u03c0)\nn Tn e\n0\n0\nFor m \u2208 PL \u2229 Zn , let \u03b4m \u2208 \u0393(L\u0304)\u2032 be the distributional section defined by\nZ\n1\n\u03b4m (\u03c4\u0304 ) = \u03c4\u0302 \u0304m (m) =\neim*\u03b8 \u03c4\u03040 (m, \u03b8)d\u03b8,\n(2\u03c0)n Tn\n\n(4.5)\n\nfor all \u03c4 \u2208 \u0393(L). We have\nQ\nTheorem\n4.7 The vector space HR\nis the finite-dimensional vector space generated by\np\nm\n{\u03b4 \u2297 |dX|}m\u2208PX \u2229Zn .\n\nTherefore, quantization in the real polarization is also given by the integral points in the interior\nof the moment polytope. Recall, from Section 3.2 and Remarks 3.7 and 3.8, that PL \u2282 PX is\nobtained from PX by a one-half shift along the inward pointing normals to the facets of PX . In\nSection 4.3, these distributional sections will be described as coming from holomorphic sections\nthrough degeneration of the complex structure.\n, j = 1, . . . , n, in (4.3) on the distributions \u03b4m in\nProof of Theorem 4.7. By acting with \u2207R\n\u2202/\u2202\u03b8 j\n\n(4.5) we conclude that they belong to ker \u2207R . Moreover, any element of the kernel can be restricted\nto the open orbit, by restricting it to sections of L\u0304 with compact support contained in the open\norbit. From, Proposition 3.1 in [BFMN11], we see that such restrictions can only have support\nalong \u03bc\u22121 (P\u030cX \u2229 Zn ), as these are the only fibers along which \u2207R has trivial holonomy, and one\neasily verifies that \u03b4m is the unique (up to a constant) solution supported on \u03bc\u22121 (m).\n22\n\n\fIt remains to be shown that there are no more elements in the kernel of \u2207R . All we need to\nshow is that there are no solutions with support along \u03bc\u22121 (\u2202PX ). Let us consider a solution with\nn\nsupport along \u03bc\u22121 (xjv = 0), for some fixed j = 1, . . . , n. Let x\u030cv = (x1v , . . . , xvj\u22121 , xj+1\nv , . . . , xv ) and\nj\u22121\nj+1\n\u03b8\u030cv = (\u03b8v1 , . . . , \u03b8v , \u03b8v , . . . , \u03b8vn ). In a neighborhood of the preimage by \u03bc of the interior of the facet\nxjv = 0 of PX , we can take coordinates (u, v, x\u030cv , \u03b8\u030cv ) (see, for example [DP09], [BFMN11]), so that\nxjv = 0 \u21d4 (u, v) = (0, 0) and\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\n\u2202\ni\n\u2207R\u2202 = \u2212i \u2212v\n+u\n+ ,\nj\n\u2202u\n\u2202v\n2\n\u2202\u03b8v\nin that neighborhood. A solution with support along the facet will be of the form,\n\u03c3=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(1)\n\u03b1kl (x\u030cv , \u03b8\u030cv )\u03b4(k) (u)\u03b4(l) (v)1U\n,\nv\n\nk,l=0\n\nwhere only a finite number of terms in the sum can be nonzero and where \u03b4(k) denotes the order-k\nderivative of the Dirac \u03b4 distribution. (See Theorem 2.3.5 of [H\u00f6r90].) Using x\u03b4(k) (x) = \u2212k\u03b4(k\u22121) (x)\nU (1)\nand polynomial test sections of the form uk v l \u03c71v , where \u03c7 is a cutoff function which is constant\nand equal to 1 in the neighborhood, t he condition \u2207R\u2202 \u03c3 = 0 then implies that such a distributional\nj\n\u2202\u03b8v\n\nsection is zero. Therefore, no nonzero solutions of this form exist.\nAs we will see in the next section, there is complete agreement between the direct approach to\nhalf-form corrected quantization in the real polarization and the approach based on degeneration\nof holomorphic sections. We note that the partial connection \u2207R \"remembers\" the degeneration\nprocedure due to the contribution of the Ricci-curvature term.\nIt is possible to gain some more geometric intuition about the fact that the boundary of PX\ndoes not contribute to the kernel of \u2207R , unlike what happens without the half-form correction\n[BFMN11]. As s \u2192 \u221e, the piece of the connection \u2207Is coming from the Levi\u2013Civita connection\non the canonical bundle of X develops curvature singularities outside of the open orbit U0 . This\nis behind the fact, shown above, that for the real polarization the half-form correction forbids\nsolutions of the covariant constancy equations supported on \u03bc\u22121 (\u2202PX ). For completeness, let us\ndescribe these curvature singularities in more detail.\nRecall Lemma 2.13, which gives explicit expressions for the Chern connection 1-forms on K U (1)\n(induced from the Chern connection on K) in the vertex atlas. The proof of the following Proposition is immediate.\nProposition 4.8\nK\n\nlim \u0398v Is =\n\ns\u2192\u221e\n\nn\nX\n\nd\u03b8vj ,\n\nj=1\n\nin the sense that for any closed curve C, with C \u2282 Uv \\ \u03bc\u22121 (\u2202PX ) = U0 \u223c\n= (C\u2217 )n , the holonomy of\nthe singular connection, along C depends only on the homotopy class of C in U0 and,\nlim\n\nI\n\ns\u2192\u221e C\n\nK\n\u0398v Is\n\n=i\n\nI X\nn\nC j=1\n\nd\u03b8vj .\n\nTherefore, in the limit s \u2192 \u221e, we obtain a singular connection on K U (1) , flat on \u03bc\u22121 (P\u030cX ),\nwith curvature supported on \u03bc\u22121 (\u2202PX ) = \u222ari=1 Di and with nonvanishing monodromies around the\n\n23\n\n\ftoric invariant divisors. In the vertex chart Uv the curvature, in the limit s \u2192 \u221e, is given by the\nfollowing current\nn\nX\n\u03b4(ajv )\u03b4(bjv )dajv \u2227 dbjv ,\n2\u03c0i\nj=1\n\nwhere (a1v , b1v , . . . , anv , bnv ), with ajv =\nUv .\n\n4.3\n\np\n\nxjv cos \u03b8vj , bjv =\n\np\n\nxjv sin \u03b8vj , i = 1, . . . , n, are coordinates on\n\nDegeneration to the real polarization\n\nIn this section, we will obtain the degeneration, as s \u2192 \u221e, of the (appropriately L2 -normalized)\nelements \u03c3\u0302sm of the orthogonal basis of HIQs , defined in Theorem 3.6, to the same distributional\np\nQ\nsections \u03b4m \u2297 |dX| \u2208 HR\nobtained in the previous section, see Definition 4.5, (4.5) and Theorem\nQ\n4.7. In particular, this will allow us to define a natural inner product in HR\n. We will first study\nQ\nm\nthe degeneration of the basis elements \u03c3s of BIs and then the degeneration of the sections \u03bcIs of\np\n|KIs |.\nAs the complex structure Is varies with s, we can regard the spaces BIQs of Is -holomorphic\nsections, described in Definition 3.1, as finite-dimensional subspaces of the fixed infinite-dimensional\nspace of distributional sections of L (see Section 4.1). That is, for all s,\nBIQs \u2282 \u0393(L) \u2282 \u0393(L\u0304)\u2032 .\nWe will study (weak) convergence of Is -holomorphic sections in \u0393(L\u0304)\u2032 , as s \u2192 \u221e. Denote the Is holomorphic section of L associated to m \u2208 PL \u2229 Zn by \u03c3sm , as in Theorem 3.6. Suppose \u03c4 \u2208 \u0393(L) is\nU (1)\nU (1)\ngiven locally by {\u03c40 10 , \u03c4v 1v\n: v \u2208 V } and let m \u2208 PL \u2229 Zn . Then since X\u030c and the holomorphic\nvertex charts Uv are dense in X, we see from Theorem 3.6 that\nZ\n\u03c9n\n1\n1/2\nm \u2212hI0s\nm\n(4.6)\n\u03c4\u0304\nkdZk\nw\ne\ni(\u03c3s )(\u03c4\u0304 ) =\n0\nK\n(2\u03c0)n X\u030c\nn!\nZ\n1\n1\n\u03c9n\n1/2\nlv (m)*ysv \u2212hIvs +1/2*ysv\n2 kdZ k\n=\nw\n|\ndet\nA\n|\n,\n\u03c4\u0304\nv\nv\nv\nK\n(2\u03c0)n Uv v\nn!\nwhere ysv = \u2202gs /\u2202xv .\nThe next lemma, which we recall from [BFMN11], will allow us to use Laplace's approximation\nto compute the asymptotics that we are interested in.\nLemma 4.9 [BFMN11, Lemma 5.1] For m \u2208 PX and any smooth function \u03c8 which is strictly\nconvex on a neighborhood of PX , let\nfm := (x\u2212m) * \u2202\u03c8/\u2202x \u2212 \u03c8.\nThen fm has a minimum value of \u2212\u03c8(m) on P which is obtained at the unique point x = m.\nMoreover,\n(Hess fm ) (m) = (Hess \u03c8) (m).\nRemark 4.10 It is important to observe that the function fm in Lemma 4.9 has a unique minimum\non the entire polytope PX , not just the interior, which implies that the leading order asymptotics\nthat we will be interested in all arise from the behavior of the integrand at x = m.\n\u2666\nRecall,\n24\n\n\fLemma 4.11 (Laplace's Approximation) Suppose a function f \u2208 C 2 (R) on the closed region R \u2282\nRn has a unique nondegenerate minimum the unique point x0 \u2208 \u0158 in the interior of R; so in\nparticular, Hessx0 f is positive definite. Then if gs is a continuous function on R such that gs \u223c\nsr g0 + O(sr\u22121 ), s \u2192 \u221e, we have\nZ\n\nR\n\n\u2212sf\n\ne\n\ngs dx \u223c\n\n\u0012\n\n2\u03c0\ns\n\n\u0013n/2\n\ne\u2212sf (x0 ) sr g0 (x0 )\np\n, s \u2192 \u221e.\ndet (Hess f ) (x0 )\n\nLemma 4.12 As s \u2192 \u221e, the leading order asymptotic value of the L2 -norm of the family of\nsections \u03c3sm , s \u2208 R>0 is\nk\u03c3sm k2L2 \u223c \u03c0 n/2 e2gs (m) .\nProof.

Note that Gs =\nG0 + s Hess \u03c8 implies\ndet Gs \u223c sn det Hess \u03c8 + O(sn\u22121 ).\n(4.8)\nWe would like to apply Laplace's approximation to the integral (4.7). By Lemma 4.9, the first\nexponential has the correct behavior. The only remaining subtlety is to show that the remainder of the integrand is continuous on PX , which is not immediate since gs is singular along\n\u2202PX . Using the explicit expression (2.6) and the regularity conditions (2.7), we conclude that\ne\u22122((x\u2212m)*y0 \u2212g0 ) (det Gs )1/2 behaves like\n1\n\n1\n\n\u03a0ri=1 li (x)( 2 li (m)\u2212 2 )\ntimes a smooth function on PX . Therefore, it is continuous and goes to zero at the boundary of\nPX precisely when m belongs to the corrected polytope PL \u2282 PX . From another point of view,\nthe integrand in (4.7) is the pointwise norm of the Tn -invariant holomorphic section \u03c3sm , which is\nnecessarily continuous on PX . Then, Laplace's approximation (Lemma 4.11) yields\n\u0012 \u0013n/2 2s\u03c8(m) 2g0 (m) n/2 p\ndet Hess \u03c8(m)\ne\ne\ns\n2\u03c0\nm 2\np\nk\u03c3s kL2 \u223c\n= \u03c0 n/2 e2gs (m)\nn\ns\n2 det Hess \u03c8(m)\n\nas desired.\n\nRecall that Gs = G0 + s Hess \u03c8, where G0 = Hess(gP + \u03c6).\nTheorem 4.13 For each \u03c4 \u2208 \u0393(L), the leading order asymptotic value of i (\u03c3sm / k\u03c3sm kL2 ) on \u03c4\u0304 as\ns \u2192 \u221e is determined by\n!\n\u03c3sm (det Gs )1/4\n(\u03c4\u0304 ) \u223c 2n/2 \u03c0 n/4 \u03c4\u0304\u02c60,m (m).\ni\nk\u03c3sm kL2\n25\n\n\fThat is, in terms of the distributional sections \u03b4m , m \u2208 PX \u2229 Zn , described in the Section 4.2,\nformula (4.5),\n\u03c3 m (det Gs )1/4\nlim s\n= 2n/2 \u03c0 n/4 \u03b4m .\ns\u2192\u221e\nk\u03c3sm kL2\n\nProof.

This extra factor is better understood in the context\nof the degeneration of HIQs which we now study.\np\nTo have the p\nspaces \u0393( |Ks |), for all s \u2265 0, as subspaces of a given fixed vector space, we\nconsider \u03b1 \u2208 \u0393( |Ks |)(U ), for an open set U \u2282 X, as a map \u03b1 : X (U )n \u2192 C(U ), where X (U )\nis the space of smooth complex vector fields on U and C(U ) is the space of continuous complex\nvalued functions on U . Then, we define\nlim \u03b1s = \u03b2 \u21d4 lim \u03b1s (X1 , . . . , Xn ) = \u03b2(X1 , . . . , Xn ),\n\ns\u2192\u221e\n\ns\u2192\u221e\n\nfor all X1 , . . .

Notice that although in general one expects hdZI , dZJ i\nto be complex, in the toric case it turns out to be real (and positive) since the unitarization of KI\nis equal to the unitarization of KJ , whence the phases do not contribute to the pairing. To put it\nin another way, the pairing of KI and KJ is entirely captured\nbundles |KI | and\np\np by the modulus\n|KJ |. Consequently we define a pairing between sections of |KI | and |KJ | by\n1\n\nh\u03bcI , \u03bcJ i :=\n\nhdZI , dZJ i 2\n1\n\n1\n\n,\n\n(5.2)\n\n2\n2\nkdZJ kK\nkdZI kK\nI\nJ\n\n\u221a\nwhere \u03bcI , \u03bcJ are defined in (3.4).

(Recall that we could have more general deformations of I0 defined\nby \u03c8(s).) We can consider the BKS pairing for two values s, s\u2032 in the same simple family. As we\nwill see, even for these simple families, the BKS pairing is not unitary.\nFrom Proposition 5.1, we see that I- and J-holomorphic sections associated with different\nintegral points are orthogonal. In the following we will therefore consider only one \"Fourier\" sector\nat a time, that is, a one-dimensional subspace of the quantization space. Let m \u2208 PL \u2229 Zn , and\nconsider the corresponding monomial section \u03c3\u0302sm \u2208 HIQs .\nSince the BKS pairing h\u03c3\u0302sm , \u03c3\u0302sm\u2032 iBKS is real and positive (the integrand is positive), the unitarity\nof the BKS pairing map for the complex structures s, s\u2032 is equivalent to\nh\u03c3\u0302sm , \u03c3\u0302sm\u2032 iBKS = ||\u03c3\u0302sm ||L2 * ||\u03c3\u0302sm\u2032 ||L2 .\nFor our choice of monomial sections, writing out the integral in Proposition 5.1 shows that for some\nfunction \u03b1 \u2208 C \u221e (R\u22650 ),\nh\u03c3\u0302sm , \u03c3\u0302sm\u2032 iBKS = \u03b1(s + s\u2032 ) > 0.\np\nUnitarity then implies \u03b1(s + s\u2032 ) = \u03b1(2s)\u03b1(2s\u2032 ).

This naturally corresponds to\nthe space of allowed Guillemin-Abreu symplectic potentials modulo additive constants, since two\nsymplectic potentials define the same holomorphic coordinates iff they differ by an additive constant.\nNote that if gI is a symplectic potential defining the complex structure I, then gI + s\u03c8 where\ns \u2208 R, \u03c8 \u2208 C \u221e (PX ) will also be an allowed symplectic potential provided that |s| is sufficiently\nsmall. Therefore, we can regard I as an open subset of the affine space gPX + (C \u221e (PX ))/R. Fix a\npoint p \u2208 P\u030cX . In the following we will assume that for each complex structure I \u2208 I a symplectic\npotential gI was chosen such that gI (p) \u2212 gPX (p) = 0.\nOne can define a vector bundle over I, HQ \u2192 I, with fiber HIQ . The bundle HQ is the natural\nsetting for studying the dependence of K\u00e4hler quantization on the choice of complex structure.\nAs mentioned in the introduction, Axelrod, Della Pietra and Witten in [APW91] (see also the\nrelated work [Hit90] of Hitchin), for the case where I is the space of linear complex structures on\nR2n which are compatible with the standard symplectic form, but without including the half-form\ncorrection, introduced a natural unitary connection, which is called the quantum connection, on\nthe analogue of the quantum bundle HQ . This quantum connection is defined to be the projection\nof the trivial connection in I \u00d7 \u0393(l) to HQ .\nIn our case, the BKS pairing induces a connection, \u2207Q , on HQ \u2192 I as follows. Recall that\ndifferent Fourier modes are orthogonal with respect to the BKS pairing, so that we can consider\neach Fourier mode labeled by m \u2208 PL \u2229 Zn separately. Consider the monomial sections \u03c3\u0302Im \u2208 HIq ,\nI \u2208 I, m \u2208 PL \u2229 Zn . Define \u2207Q\n\u03c8 by\nm\nm\nh\u2207Q\n\u03c8 \u03c3\u0302I , \u03c3\u0302I i =\n\nd\nh\u03c3\u0302 m , \u03c3\u0302 m i,\nds |s=0 I+s\u03c8 I\n\nwhere \u03c8 \u2208 C \u221e (PX ) with \u03c8(p) = 0 and where I + s\u03c8 denotes the complex structure defined by the\nsymplectic potential gI + s\u03c8 for |s| sufficiently small. Note that, by construction, \u2207Q is unitary.\nA final implication of the fact that all of the complex structures arising from points in I have\nthe same \"phases\" (that is, of Lemma 2.9) and of the consequent reality of the BKS pairing is the\nfollowing theorem.\nTheorem 5.4 The global frame for HQ \u2192 I given by {\u03c3\u0302Im /||\u03c3\u0302Im ||}m\u2208PL \u2229Zn is horizontal with\nrespect to \u2207Q . Therefore, the connection \u2207Q is flat.\n30\n\n\fProof.

Note also that, in general, if a square root of the\ncanonical bundle exists then there may be many choices of square root, and\n\u221a they are parameterized\n1\n1\nby H (X, Z2 ). For toric varieties, H (X, Z2 ) = {0}, and so if it exists, K is unique.\nLet {\u03bdj }j=1,...,r be primitive generators of the 1-dimensional cones in the fan \u03a3. Let L be\na holomorphic line bundle on X. The divisor of a torus-invariant meromorphic section of L on\nany holomorphic vertex chart Uv determines the section up to multiplicative constant. Indeed, a\ntorus-invariant principal divisor is of the form\nr\nX\ni=1\n\nh\u03b1, \u03bdj iDj ,\n\nfor \u03b1 \u2208 Rn . If, say, \u03bd1 , . . . , \u03bdn are the generators associated to Uv , which form a basis of Zn , then\nthe restriction of the principal divisor to Uv determines it completely since \u03b1 is fixed by its inner\nproducts with \u03bd1 , . . . , \u03bdn . Such a line bundle has a system of meromorphic locally trivializing sections {1L\nv } on the holomorphic vertex charts, as in Section 2.2.3, defined uniquely (up to constants)\nby the property that div(1L\nv )|Uv = 0.\n\u221a\nIf c1 (X) is even then K exists and it has a system of \u221aholomorphic trivializations on the\nholomorphic vertex charts given by {(Uv , 1v )}, where 1v := 1v K . Then, {(Uv , 1v \u2297 1v )} gives a\nsystem of trivializing sections for K and we have, up to an irrelevant\u221aconstant, 1v \u2297 1v \u221a\n= dWv .\n, dWv )}\nTherefore, the sections dWv have even divisors and we can write 1v = dWv where {(Uv\u221a\nis a system of holomorphic trivializing sections on the holomorphic vertex charts for K. We\ntherefore have\n\u221a\nProposition 6.1 If c1 (X) is even, then the\n\u221a sections dWv have even divisors and {(Uv , dWv )} is\na system of holomorphic trivializations of K.\n\u221a\nAs a consequence, we obtain the following useful criterion for the existence of K. For a vertex\nv, let us call vertex basis associated to v to a basis of Zn given by the primitive generators of the\n1-dimensional cones defining v.\nProposition 6.2 K admits a square root if and only if for each 1-dimensional cone F in \u03a3 the\nsum of the coordinates of the primitive generator \u03bdF expressed in any one of the vertex basis is odd.\n\u221a\nProof. We\nhave\nseen\nthat\nthe\nexistence\nof\nK is equivalent to having a system of trivializing\n\u221a\nsections { dWv } where the dWv all have even divisors. Choose a vertex v and let \u03bd1 , . . . \u03bdn be a\nvertex basis for v. Then, using Lemma 2.10 and the fact that dZv is a constant multiple of dZ,\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nr\nr\nn\nX\nX\nX\nj\uf8f8\n1\n\uf8ed\nDi ,\n\u03bdi Di \u2212\ndiv(dWv ) = div(wv ) + div(dZv ) =\ni=n+1\n\n31\n\nj=1\n\ni=n+1\n\n\fwhere \u03bdij is the jth coordinate of the vector \u03bdi in the vertex basis. Therefore, this divisor is even\nP\niff nj=1 \u03bdij is odd for all i. Clearly, this happens for any v and the proposition follows.\n\nAcknowledgements: We wish to thank Thomas Baier for extensive discussions on the subject of the paper.
