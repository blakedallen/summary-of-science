Black hole initial data is usually produced using Bowen-York type puncture initial data or by applying an excision\nboundary condition. The benefits of the Bowen-York initial data are the ability to specify the spin and momentum of the system as\nparameters of the initial data. In an attempt to extend these benefits to other formulations of the Einstein constraints, the puncture\nmethod is reformulated using distributions as source terms. It is shown how the Bowen-York puncture black hole initial data and\nthe trumpet variation is generated by distributional sources. A heuristic argument is presented to argue that these sources are the\ngeneral sources of spin and momentum. In order to clarify the meaning of other distributional sources, an exact family of initial\ndata with generalized sources to the Hamiltonian constraint are studied; spinning trumpet black hole initial data and black hole\ninitial data with higher order momentum sources are also studied.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe necessity that gravitational collapse leads to the generic formation of singularities distinguishes general relativity\nfrom other classical theories where point sources only enter as idealizations. Unfortunately, the use of distributions\nto describe sources in Einstein's equations is limited to a subset of distributions which is just regular enough for the\nequations to be well defined as shown in Geroch and Traschen (1987). These distributions must not be too singular and\nhave at most codimension 1. Nevertheless, many studies have described the structure of various singular spacetimes using\nlinear distribution theory or generalized function algebras; these studies are reviewed in Steinbauer and Vickers (2006). In\nparticular, Parker (1979) characterized the stress energy of the Schwarzschild spacetime in Kerr-Schild coordinates using\nSchwartz distributions while the Kerr solution has been characterized using Colombeau algebras(a differential algebra\nwhich seeks to provide a rigorous multiplication of generalized functions) in Parker (1979).\nIn spite of the difficulties involved with the use of distributions in general relativity, distributions have been implicitly\nused in the construction of initial data for quite some time; this will be shown in detail in this paper. In particular, the\npuncture family of initial data (including the trumpet type initial data) can be interpreted as arising from differential\nequations with distributional sources. The usual derivation of puncture initial data considers that the data exists only on a\npunctured plane R3 \u2212 {xI } with {xI } the locations of an arbitrary number of punctures; these locations are interpretable\nas an asymptotically flat extended sheet of the spacetime (see Brandt and Br\u00fcgmann (1997)) and therefore as coordinate\nsingularities. Boundary conditions are not imposed at these inner boundaries, which leads to an essential non-uniqueness\nto the constraint equations: considering the linear part of the differential operator on the entire plane R3 with distributional\nsource yields functions laying in the kernel of the differential operator in the punctured plane. This is ordinarily remedied\nby implicitly applying a boundary condition; the conformal factor is decomposed into a singular part and a regular part, and\nthe Hamiltonian constraint is extended to the entire plane (Brandt and Br\u00fcgmann (1997)), thereby imposing an implicit\nregularity boundary condition on the remainder while the singular part is chosen arbitrarily to be one of these distributional\nsolutions to the linear part of the differential operator.\nTo the extent that this \"puncture\" procedure is rigorous, problems of multiplication of distributions can be ignored\nand the distributions can be used to parameterise the functions lying in the kernel of the differential operator. The resulting\nfunctions are regular on the punctured plane and solving for the remainder on the entire plane implicitly chooses a\n\n\fDistributional sources for black hole initial data\n\n2\n\nboundary condition by regularity. In this paper, I follow this procedure to produce and study initial data with distributional\n\"source\" terms.\nThe layout of the paper is as follows. In section 2 the Green's function for the momentum equation is derived in the\nconformally flat, maximally sliced transverse-traceless decomposition of the initial value problem for general relativity. It\nis also shown how the puncture solution to the Hamiltonian constraint arises from a distributional source. In section 2.3 the\nsources for the trumpet black hole initial data are derived. In section 3 exact initial data having dipole and quadrupole type\nmass moments are considered while in section 4 spinning trumpet initial data and intial data with higher order momentum\nmoments are considered. Finally, in section 5, the results of the paper are summarised. Througout this paper, I use units\nwhere c = G = 1 and indices run over spatial indices unless otherwise specified.\n2. Solutions to the constraint equations parameterised by distributions\n2.1. Green's function for the momentum equation\nThe Hamiltonian and momentum constraint of Einstein's equations in the ADM formulation are\nR + K 2 \u2212 Kij K ij = 16\u03c0\u03c1\n\u0001\n\u2207j K ij \u2212 g ij K = 8\u03c0j i\n\n(1)\n\n\u22072 \u03c8 + 8\u22121 \u03c8 \u22127 Aij Aij + 2\u03c0 \u03c1\u0302 = 0,\n\n(3)\n\n\u22072 Vi + 3\u22121 \u2202i \u2202j V j \u2212 8\u03c0 \u0135i = 0,\n\n(4)\n\n(2)\n\nwith R the Ricci scalar of the initial spatial hypersurface with metric gij and Kij it's extrinsic curvature with trace K.\nWhen one performs the conformal transverse-traceless decomposition constraint equations and chooses a conformally\nflat background gij = \u03c8 4 \u03b4ij (\u03c8 is the conformal factor) and maximal slicing K = 0, the Hamiltonian and momentum\nconstraint are respectively\n\nwhere \u03c1\u0302 and \u0135i are the rescaled energy density and momentum vector respectively given in terms of the normal to the\ninitial hypersurface na and the projection tensor \u03b3ab and the stress energy tensor as\n\u03c1\u0302 = \u03c8 5 \u03c1 = \u03c8 5 Tab na nb\n\n(5)\n\n\u0135i = \u03c8 6 ji = \u03c8 6 Tab na \u03b3 b i\n\n(6)\n\n(in these equations, sums are carried out over the spacetime indices) and Aij = \u2202j Vi +\u2202i Vj \u22122/3\u03b4ij \u2202k V k is the conformal\nextrinsic curvature with Kij = \u03c8 \u22122 Aij . Initial data satisfying these equations are commonly referred to as Bowen-York\ninitial data. Since the conformal background is flat, indices are raised and lowered with the flat metric and in particular\nVi = V i . Because of the use of the flat background, coordinate delta functions will be used in the following analysis.\nThe basic form of the stress energy tensor of point-like particles as an idealization of extended objects has been\nderived in a different context in Steinhoff and Puetzfeld (2010), where neglecting higher order multipole moments, the\nstress energy tensor of a pointlike source was shown to be\n\u221a\n\u2212gT ab = u(a pb) \u03b4 \u2212 S c(a ub) \u2207c \u03b4\n(7)\n\u221a\nwhere the factor \u2212g is appearing because of the use of coordinate delta functions. By finding the fundamental solution\nto the momentum constraint, the source terms for Bowen-York type initial data will be derived and shown to be exactly\nanalogous to these terms.\nThe Malgrange-Ehrenpreis theorem guarantees the existence of a Green's function for the momentum constraint; to\nfind it, the source is set to \u0135i (x) = Pi \u03b4(x) with its Fourier transform being j\u0303i = Pi . The fundamental solution is then\nfound by Fourier transforming the momentum constraint, algebraically rearranging terms and integrating to get\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nPi\nxi xj Pj\n\u1e7ci = \u2212\n7\n.\n(8)\n+\n4\n|x|\n|x|3\n\n\fDistributional sources for black hole initial data\n\n3\n\nThis is of course the linear momentum solution first derived in Bowen and York (1980) showing that the source of linear\nmomentum arises as a point source Dirac delta distribution. This result can immediately be used to write down the general\nsolution to the momentum constraint (with homogeneous boundary conditions at infinity)\n!\nZ\n\u0135i (y)\n(xi \u2212 yi )(xj \u2212 y j )\u0135j (y)\n1\n7\nd3 y.\n(9)\n+\nVi = \u2212\n4\n|x \u2212 y|\n|x \u2212 y|3\nThis general solution can be used to show that the source \u0135 i = \u22121/2\u01ebijk Sk \u2202j \u03b4(x) with \u01ebijk the flat space Levi-Civita\ntensor gives the vector field\nS k xj \u01ebijk\n,\n(10)\n|x|3\nwhich is precisely the angular momentum solution of Bowen and York.\nThe combination of the delta function source for the linear momentum term and the gradient term for the angular\nmomentum yields the total source for the momentum equation for puncture initial data\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nk j\n(11)\n\u0135i = Pi \u2212 \u01ebijk S \u2202 \u03b4(x).\n2\nVi =\n\nBowen and York (1980) noted that the parameters P i and S i are exactly the ADM linear and angular momentum\nrespectively. It is exactly this property that makes the Bowen-York initial data so useful. Heuristically, this can be expected\nto always be the case on a maximal slice, since the ADM linear and angular momenta (associated with the translational\nand rotational killing vectors \u03be a ) as limits of integrals on spheres Sr can be converted to volume integrals\nZ\nI\n\u2207a (K a b \u03be b )dV\n(12)\nK a b \u03be b dAa = lim\n8\u03c0P\u03be = lim\nr\u2192\u221e\n\nr\u2192\u221e\n\nSr\n\nBr\n\nif one assumes that the extrinsic curvature is valid on the entire open ball Br . The momentum equation (4) can then be\nused to simplify the volume integrals\nZ\nZ\nZ\njb \u03be b dV =\njb \u03be b dV =\nP\u03be = lim\n\u0135b \u03be b dV\u0302\n(13)\nr\u2192\u221e\n\nBr\n\nBr\n\nBr\n\nin the second equality the limit vanishes because of the compact support of ji , dV is the volume form in the initial\nhypersurface and dV\u0302 being the volume form in the conformal background. When the only source term is a momenta,\nthe translational killing vector measures precisely P i and when the only source term is a spin the rotational killing vector\nmeasures precisely S i . This argument suffers from the weakness of distribution theory in converting from the surface\nintegral to the volume integral and from going from the invariant volume element to the coordinate one. It is completely\nvalid however within the nonlinear generalized function theory of Colombeau algebras (see Grosser et al. (2001) for an\nintroduction to this theory).\n2.2. The Hamiltonian constraint\nThe usual way for solving the Hamiltonian constraint (3) in the puncture formalism is by decomposing \u03c8 = \u03c8singular + u\nand having each component satisfy the following equations respectively\n\u22072 \u03c8singular + 2\u03c0 \u03c1\u0302 = 0,\n\n\u22072 u + 8\u22121 \u03c8 \u22127 Aij Aij = 0,\n\n(14)\n(15)\n\nwhere (14) is implicitly solved using a pointlike source \u03c1\u0302 = M \u03b4(x \u2212 xI ) so that \u03c8singular = 1 + M/2|x \u2212 xI |. Then\none needs to solve only the single equation (usually numerically) for puncture initial data, (15). For vanishing extrinsic\ncurvature, it is already known from Parker (1979) that the source term for Schwarzschild solution is a delta function,\nalthough there it is associated with a physical singularity while here it is associated with a coordinate singularity.\nOne should note that the original problem is ill posed (the solution is not unique) on the punctured plane R3 \u2212 {xI }\nwithout suitable boundary conditions at the origin. Namely, any solution to (14) having distributional source \u03c1\u0302 at the\n\n\fDistributional sources for black hole initial data\n\n4\n\npunctures lies in the kernel of the Laplacian; for instance the mass term M above is not unique\u2013any mass will solve the\nHamiltonian constraint (3). This ill-posedness could be removed by considering the original solution on the entire plane\nand considering the confomal factor to have a Dirac delta source term, in this case the puncture formalism is just a form\nof regularization but a nonlinear theory of distributions is necessary. Alternately, the above decomposition and implied\nregularity on u can be considered in lieu of a boundary condition. This ill-posedness is often exploited to iterate over\nthe bare mass until the black hole has a desired horizon mass as outlined in Br\u00fcgmann et al. (2008). Parameterising the\nsingular part via a distribution is preferable to appealing to a topological condition such as a compactified alternate world\nsheet if only for its simplicity.\n2.3. Trumpet initial data\nIt was numerically verified in Hannam et al. (2007) that the evolution under dynamic gauge conditions of puncture\nspacetimes causes the power of the singularity of the conformal factor to change in time. For this reason, the exact slicing\nof the Schwarzschild geometry that satisfies a gauge condition close to the normal gauge condition used in evolution\nwas found by Baumgarte and Naculich (2007). This solution has been used to produce initial data in Hannam et al.\n(2009); Immerman and Baumgarte (2009) on the punctured plane which has been termed \"trumpet\" initial data. It should\nbe emphasized that with zero momentum the trumpet black hole is identically a Schwarzschild black hole. Since the\nformulation used is again Bowen and York's conformally flat, transverse traceless decomposition, the singular structure\nwhich is implictly parameterising the initial data can be studied using the Green's function from the previous section.\nFor a trumpet black hole, there is a background extrinsic curvature in addition to the Bowen-York spin and momentum\nterms. This background extrinsic curvature is given by Immerman and Baumgarte (2009)\n\u221a\nxi xj \u0011\n3 3M 2 \u0010\n\u03b4\n\u2212\n(16)\nAij =\nij\n4r3\nr2\nand the corresponding exact conformal factor is\nr\nR(r)\n\u03c8=\n(17)\nr\nwith the areal radius R(r) given implicitly in terms of the isotropic radius r\n#1/\u221a2\n# \"\n\"\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2\n2\n(4 + 3 2)(2R \u2212 3M )\n2R + M + 4R + 4M R + 3M\n\u221a\n\u00d7\n. (18)\nr =\n4\n8R + 6M + 3 8R2 + 8M R + 6M 2\nThe presence of terms in the extrinsic curvature which scale inversely as r3 is an indication that the momentum\nsources must contain derivatives of the delta function. A generic source of the form\n\u0135i = Bij \u2202j \u03b4(x)\n\n(19)\n\ntogether with the general solution to the momentum constraint (9) can be used to determine the corresponding first order\nsolution to the momentum constraint.

For this reason, separating the Hamiltonian constraint to factor out the singular part of the conformal factor is\nnecessary for trumpet data only to formulate a numerical method that does not have a singular solution whereas for the\noriginal puncture data it is necessary to deal with a fundamental ill posedness and select a mass term. In\npthis case, where\none factors out the singularity only for numerical purposes, it suffices to factor out only the singularity 3M/2r in order\nto ensure that the remainder u is bounded (although a more sophisticated factor is needed for spinning trumpets), and the\nHamiltonian constraint is well defined over all R3 . This fact is used in section 4 to produce spinning trumpet initial data\nas well as more general initial data.\n3. Initial data with higher order mass moments\nFar from a source, the source itself may be idealized as a point particle with various mass moments (usually described in\nterms of multipoles). In this case the only equation to be solved is the linear part of the Hamiltonian constraint (3). The\nmatter distribution that enters the field equations in this case is a series of derivatives of the delta function. In Newtonian\nphysics, where mass is always positive, a dipole moment (the first order moment) is always zero except when the first order\nmoment is computed about an origin which is not the barycentre; it is unclear to what extent this is meaningful in general\nrelativity. A quadrupole moment (the trace-free second order moment) quantifies the asymmetry of the distribution.\nConsidering the first two matter moments, the conformal source term including up to quadrupole terms is\n\u0001\n(26)\n\u03c1\u0302 = 1 \u2212 Di \u2202i + Rij \u2202i \u2202j \u03b4(x)\n\nwith Di quantifying the dipole moment and Rij quantifying the second order moment (not the trace-free quadrupole\nR\nmoment). For\na generic matter distribution with unit mass, the terms in this idealization can be computed as Di = \u03c1\u0302xi dv\u0302\nR\nand Rij = \u03c1\u0302xi xj dv\u0302. It is possible to derive many forms for the second order moment, however for a ring with negligible\ncross section\nq\n(27)\nRij = (\u03b4xi \u03b4xj + \u03b4yi \u03b4yj )\n4\nwith scalar quadrupole moment q being a combination of the mass and radius of the ring. If the dipole moment is aligned\nto the z axis so that Di = (0, 0, d), the solution to the Hamiltonian constraint (3) with source (26) is given by\n\u03c8 =1+\n\n1\nq\ndz\n+ 3 + 5 (x2 + y 2 \u2212 2z 2 )\n2r 2r\n8r\n\n(28)\n\nso long as \u0135i = 0 and so Aij = Kij = 0.\nThese intitial data generically contain coordinate singularities with spherical topology: a closed surface where the\nconformal factor goes to zero. In the physical space, these surfaces would correspond to extended points; all points on the\ncoordinate surface are separated by zero distance. As seen in figure 1 and figure 2 these coordinate singularity surfaces are\n\n\fDistributional sources for black hole initial data\n\n6\n\ngenerically contained within the apparent horizons of the spacetimes (see Thornburg (1996) for an overview of apparent\nhorizons and horizon finding). The interior regions of these coordinate singularities are topologically S 3 . Perhaps more\ninterestingly, these surfaces of equidistant points ensure that the origin is a finite distance away from any other point in the\nplane; much like the trumpet initial data, it is no longer possible to interpret the origin to be the conformally compactified\ninfinity of an alternate world sheet.\n\nd = 0.15\nd = 0.075\nd=0\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\n(\n\nzM\n\n)\n\n0.2\n0.0\n\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.4\n\n\u22120.6\n\n\u22120.4\n\n\u22120.2\n\n0.0\n\nxM\n(\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n)\n\nFigure 1. Apparent horizons (outer curves) and coordinate singularities (inner curves) plotted for spacetimes with various dipole\nmoments d added. The inner curves represent coordinate singularities in the metric where the spatial metric vanishes. The\ncentroid of the apparent horizon shifts upwards with increasing dipole moment while the centroid of the coordinate singularity\nshifts downward.\n\nThe qualitative effect of adding the multipole moments is to change the apparent horizon in a corresponding fashion.\nThe dipole moment, for small values of d shifts the horizon in the respective direction while maintaining an overall\nspherical shape, as seen in figure 1. For larger values of the dipole moment, the apparent horizon becomes dimpled in the\ndirection \u2212Di . When the value of the quadrupole moment is small, the overall shape of the apparent horizon is elliptical,\nas seen in the left plot of figure 2. For large magnitude quadrupole moments, the apparent horizon becomes indented on\nthe equator for negative moments, and at the poles for positive moments.\nThese deformations induced on the horizons by the added structure of the distributional source terms cause the\nhorizon mass of the black hole to decrease with increasing magnitude of the moment. The mass of the black hole is\nidentified with its irreducible mass since there is no angular momentum,\nr\nA\nMirr =\n.\n(29)\n16\u03c0\nThe masses of the black holes considered in this section are plotted in figure 3. The difference between irreducible mass\nMirr and ADM mass is an estimate for the total amount of radiation in the spacetime. From the figure, one sees that for the\ndipole black holes, where the horizon could be found, the maximum amount of radiation is less than 0.1%. The horizon\nmass of the black holes with quadrupole moments is symmetric with respect to the sign of the quadrupole moment, which\nis unexpected given the difference in the structure of the apparent horizon for positive and negative quadrupole moments.\n\n\fDistributional sources for black hole initial data\n\n7\n\nq = 0.06\nq=0\nq = -0.08\n\n0.4\n\nq = 0.121\nq=0\nq = -0.17\n\n(\n\nzM\n\n)\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\n\u22120.2\n\n\u22120.4\n\n0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5\n\nrM\n(\n\n)\n\n0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5\n\nrM\n(\n\n)\n\nFigure 2.

Fully non-linear initial data with distributional sources\nConsidering completely general sources for the extrinsic curvature necessitates solving the fully non-linear Hamiltonian\nequation. Considering derivatives of the Dirac delta to higher than second order will lead to stronger singularities\nappearing in the conformal factor\u2013the m/2r term is insufficient to ensure regularity. This also occurs if one tries to\nsolve the Hamiltonian equation for the bare trumpet conformal factor numerically. Furthermore, for spinning trumpet\ninitial data, the exact implicit conformal factor is not strong enough to make the solution fully regular since the spin term\n(an antisymmetric derivative) enters at the same order as the mass term (a gradient). For numerical regularity for general\nsources, the following decomposition of the conformal factor is proposed:\n\u03c3\n(30)\n\u03c8 = 1 + \u03c8\u03c1 + p + u.\nr\nHere \u03c8\u03c1 satisfies the Poisson equation \u22072 \u03c8\u03c1 +2\u03c0 \u03c1\u0302 = 0, the term \u03c3 depends only on angle, and u is the bounded remainder\npart of the conformal factor. The extrinsic curvature term Aij Aij can always be written in terms of a denominator which\nis a power of radius r and a numerator which is polynomial in r and trigonometric functions of the angles. Considering\nonly axisymmetric sources and using spherical coordinates, the extrinsic curvature is decomposed as\nPn\u22121 i\n\u03ba(r, \u03b8)\ni=1 r \u03b1(\u03b8) + \u03b2(\u03b8)\nAij Aij \u2261\n\u2261\n(31)\nn\nr\nrn\n\n\fDistributional sources for black hole initial data\n\n8\n\n1.000\n\nMirr/MADM\n\n0.999\n0.998\n0.997\n0.996\n0.995 \u22120.15 \u22120.10 \u22120.05 0.00 0.05\nq (M3 ) or d (M2 )\n\nDipole\nQuadrupole\n0.10\n\n0.15\n\nFigure 3. Irreducible mass of non-spinning, zero momentum black hole with added dipole and quadrupole moments. The\ndifference between the irreducible mass and the ADM mass MADM = 1 estimates the fractional radiation content of these\nspacetimes. Spacetimes with dipole moments have very little radiation content in comparison to the spacetimes with quadrupole\nmoments. The extent of the curves shows the range for which apparent horizons could still be numerically found numerically.\n\nwith n the problem dependent integer such that \u03b2 6= 0. By demanding that lim rp+2 \u22072 u = 0, one concludes that\nr\u21920\n8p + 2 \u2212 n = 0 and the Hamiltonian constraint yields the following two equations\n\u25b3\u03a9 \u03c3 + p(p \u2212 1)\u03c3 +\n\n\u03b2\n\u00117 = 0,\n\u0010\n8 \u03c3 + lim rp \u03c8\u03c1\n\n(32)\n\nr\u21920\n\nrp+2 \u22072 u \u2212\n\n\u03b2\n\u03ba\n1\n=0\n\u00117 +\n\u0010\np\n8 (r (1 + u + \u03c8\u03c1 ) + \u03c3)7\n8 \u03c3 + lim rp \u03c8\u03c1\n\n(33)\n\nr\u21920\n\n2\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\nwith \u25b3\u03a9 = \u2202\u03b8\n2 + cot \u03b8 \u2202\u03b8 the angular part of the Laplacian multiplied by the radius squared. These equations would be\nanalagous for non axisymmetric sources except that \u25b3\u03a9 would be replaced by the full angular part of the Laplacian. To\nstudy solutions to these equations, Chebyshev pseudo-spectral methods are used. In particular, the collocation points are\nchosen as the roots of the Chebyshev polynomials in order to ensure regularity at the origin and symmetry axis without\nthe use of boundary conditions. In spherical coordinates, the ordinarily C 2 puncture remainder is much more regular\nand exponential convergence can be achieved as noted in Ansorg et al. (2004). The exponential convergence is shown in\nfigure 4 where the truncation error of a spinning puncture dataset displays an exponential index of convergence.\n\n4.1. Spinning trumpet initial data\nIn thep\ncase of non-spinning trumpet initial data (with or without momentum) \u03b2p= 81/8M 4 which leads p = 1/2 and\n\u03c3 = 3M/2 so that the singular part of the conformal factor is \u03c8s = 1 + 3M/2r. For spinning trumpets, it is\ninsufficient to subtract this factor or even the exact trumpet conformal factor as shown in Immerman and Baumgarte\n\n\fDistributional sources for black hole initial data\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n|\n\nan |\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n9\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\n-5\n\n-6\n\n-7\n\n-8\n\n-9\n\n-10\n\n-11\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\nn\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nFigure 4. The truncation error for a spinning puncture solution in spherical coordinates with J = 0.5 and M = 1. The\nexponential fall-off with linear increase in basis order is indicative of the function having an exponential index of convergence.\nThe use of spherical coordinates is crucial to achieve this result.\n\n(2009). However, it is possible to produce this initial data with the above decomposition where the coefficient of the\nsingular part \u03c3 has angular dependence. In the case of spinning trumpet initial data the extrinsic curvature is generated\nfrom the general solution (9) using the source\n!\n\u221a\n2\n3M\nb\n(34)\n\u2202i \u03b4(x).\nji = Sz \u01ebijz \u2202 j +\n4\n\nDue to the fact that the limiting case of both trumpet and puncture initial data with spins will have the same source term\nb\nji = Sz \u01ebijz \u2202j \u03b4(x) the limiting behaviour of the\n\u221a solutions are identical. However, the transition from the puncture type\n1/r singularity to the spinning trumpet type 1/ r singularity is singular for punctures while the transition is smooth for\nthe trumpet initial data produced by the method here. The exact singular solution may even be computed. It is known for\nBowen-York type initial data that it is not possible to produce black holes with arbitrarily large ratios of spin to mass; this\nwas detailed in Lovelace et al. (2008). To quantify the behaviour of the spinning trumpets, the dimensionless spin of the\nblack hole\nSz\n(35)\n\u03c7= 2\nM\nis monitored at the initial hypersurface using a Christodoulou-like mass\n2\nM 2 = Mirr\n+\n\nSz2\n4 .\nMirr\n\n(36)\n\nDue to the axisymmetry of the system, the spin measured on the horizon is identical to the ADM spin which is identical\nto the parameter Sz used to construct the extrinsic curvature. During evolution, the spin measured on the horizon will\n\n\fDistributional sources for black hole initial data\n\n10\n\n1.0\n\nDimensionless spin\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\nJ\n\n0.0 -2\n10\n\n\u0001\n\n10-1\n\n100\n\n101\n\nS/mp\n\n2\n\n102\n\n103\n\n104\n\nFigure 5. The dimensionless spin of the black hole measured on the horizon \u03c7 and at infinity \u03b5J as a function of bare\ndimensionless spin. Although the black hole has an initially large value of the dimensionless spin, it accretes gravitational\nradiation during evolution which increases its mass and subsequently decreases its dimensionless spin. This process causes the\nblack hole to relax, under evolution, to a dimensionless spin close to the ADM value.\n\nquickly relax to a lower equilibrium value and an excellent approximation of the relaxed value is the dimensionless spin\nas measured at infinity as argued by Lovelace et al. (2008)\nSz\n\u03b5J = 2\n(37)\nMADM\nhere Sz is a parameter of the problem but all of the masses must be measured. These quantities are displayed in figure 5\nwhere the bare parameters have been varied by many orders of magnitude. Exactly like the spinning puncture initial\ndata, it is not possible to produce black holes of arbitrary spin parameter. Although the total angular momentum of the\nsolution can be set to an arbitrary value, the mass of the spacetime increases yielding an asymptotic maximum value\nof the dimensionless spin. One sees that the limiting value of the dimensionless spin is \u03c7 \u2248 0.984 which will relax\nupon evolution to approximately the asymptotic value of \u03b5J \u2248 0.937. The data presented here has been run at multiple\nresolutions to ensure accuracy to one part in one million, the data presented are results run with the number of collocation\npoints set to (nr , n\u03b8 ) = (80, 40).\n4.2. Higher order momentum moments\nIn a close binary, it is likely that the black holes will locally have a Kerr like geometry at first order, but due to tidal effects\nwill have induced moments on their horizons. It may be desirable to incorporate these effects in the source terms used to\nconstruct initial data (or in the shape of apparent horizon). For this reason, in this section black holes with higher order\nmomentum moments are considered. In particular, the following source is considered for the momentum constraint\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n(38)\n\u01ebijz \u2202 j + Qz \u01ebijz \u2202 j \u2202z + Qc \u01ebijk \u01ebjzm \u2202m \u2202 j \u03b4(x)\n\u0135i = \u2212\n4\n\n\fDistributional sources for black hole initial data\n\n0.995\n\n11\n\nQz quadrupole\nQc quadrupole\n\nMirr (MADM)\n\n0.990\n\n0.985\n\n0.980\n\n0.975\n0.00\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\n\n0.04\n\nQz or Qc\n\n0.05\n\n0.06\n\n0.07\n\n0.08\n\nFigure 6. The change in mass for a spinning puncture as the momentum quadrupole moments are increased. The irreducible mass\nis seen to increase with the quadrupole moment, from this one can conclude that the fractional radiation content in the spacetime\nis decreasing.\n\nwith the factor 1/4 chosen to have a high but not numerically problematic spin \u03c70 \u2248 0.423. The two terms are respectively\nan axial derivative of the spin term (proportional to Qz ) and the curl of the spin term (proportional to Qc ), both give rise to\naxisymmetric systems angular dependence of a higher frequency than the spin term. The Hamiltonian constraint is chosen\nto have source \u03c1\u0302 = \u03b4(x) to make the solutions as regular as possible. Due to the increased irregularity of the solutions,\n(nr , n\u03b8 ) = (120, 50) collocation points were used to achieve convergence over the range of parameters studied here.\nThe effects of the quadrupole moments on the mass and spin of the black hole are plotted respectively in figure 6 and\nfigure 7 respectively. The Christodoulou-like mass is not plotted for these spacetimes, as the black holes are no longer\neven approximately Kerr-like. It is seen from figure 6 that the irreducible mass of the black hole increases with increasing\nquadrupole moment. Since the irreducible mass can never increase over the value of the ADM mass (this is the Penrose\ninequality, proved by Bray (2001)) during evolution, there must be less radiation in the spacetime. Because of the increase\nin the irreducible mass of the black hole, the dimensionless spin of the black hole must decrease. This effect is shown\nin figure 7, where a very steep decrease in the spin is seen with an increase in the momentum quadrupole. This effect\ncould have consequences for spinning black holes in a binary system; if the black holes are tidally interacting, the induced\nquadrupole moment could prevent the black hole from having an extremal spin by increasing its irreducible mass and with\nit enforcing cosmic censorship.\n5. Discussion\nThe above analysis revealed that the puncture (and trumpet) initial data had as its origin distributional source terms. Two\ndistinct terms that gave rise to mass terms were found, a delta function source for the Hamiltonian constraint in the case\nof puncture initial data and an isotropic delta function gradient source for the momentum constraints in the trumpet initial\ndata. The linear momentum of the puncture initial data, and subsequently the trumpet initial data, arises from a delta\nfunction source while the angular momentum arises from the contraction of an anti-symmetric (spin) tensor with the\ngradient of a delta function.\n\n\fREFERENCES\n\n12\n\n0.44\n0.42\n\nQz quadrupole\nQc quadrupole\n\nDimensionless spin\n\n0.40\n0.38\n0.36\n0.34\n0.32\n0.30\n0.28\n0.26\n0.00 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 0.08\nQz or Qc\nFigure 7. The change in dimensionless spin for a spinning puncture as the momentum quadrupole moments are increased. Due\nto the increase in mass as seen in figure 6 the dimensionless spin decreases.\n\nIt is possible to extend the method (parameterisation by distributions of the vacuum solutions) to the conformal thin\nsandwich formulation or to use alternate conformal backgrounds. The basic approach being to parameterise solutions\nlying in the kernel of the linear part of the differential equations, then to decompose the conformal factor into a source,\nsingular and regular part and finally to solve for the regularised remainder on the entire plane. This process was used to\ngenerate novel black hole initial data in section 4. Given the heuristic argument presented in section 2, the same source\nterms would need to be used to generate the extrinsic curvature for linear and angular momentum. It is possible to put this\nheuristic argument on rigorous footing using Colombeau algebras but one must then tackle the issue of uniqueness with\nrespect to mollifier if using special algebras.\nIt is also possible to extend these results to the production of binary black hole initial data. For binary data, especially\nbinary trumpet data, it may be preferable to produce individual spinning, boosted trumpets using the methods above to\nhigh order and then subtract the combined remainders so that the singular parts are correct to next to leading order. The\nresulting remainder should be much more regular in this way. The higher order moments used here may become important\nin a binary, where tidal effects will distort the horizon (Poisson and Vlasov (2010)) and with it possibly the sources.\nThe code used in the production of the nonlinear initial data studied here is freely available under the Gnu General\nPublic License at https://github.com/SwampWalker/LeapingMonkey.
