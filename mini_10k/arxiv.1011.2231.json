The spectral properties do not vary much over these 4\nmonths, with only a slight monotonic increase of the hardness ratio with the\ncount rate. This means that the erratic flaring activity of the source is not\nassociated with spectral changes, as seen in other ULXs. Conversely, comparison\nwith data obtained by Swift in 2006 shows a completely different picture: while\nat a luminosity also seen in the 2009/2010 data, the source appears with a hard\nspectrum. Thus, it appears that, as in Galactic black hole binaries, spectral\nstates in this ULX are not determined only by the X-ray luminosity.\nSubject headings: accretion, accretion disks \u2013 black hole physics \u2013 X-rays: binaries\n\u2013 X-rays: individual (Holmberg II X-1)\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nUltraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are point-like X-ray sources located outside the\nnuclei of galaxies, with luminosities LX > 3 \u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121 . These apparent luminosities,\nassuming isotropic emission, are above the Eddington limit of a 20 M\u2299 black hole. If the\nEddington limit applies to these objects then the most likely explanation is accretion onto\nintermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) of mass \u223c 102 \u2212104 M\u2299 (Colbert & Mushotzky 1999;\n1\n\nDepartment of Physics and Astronomy, University of Iowa, Van Allen Hall, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA\n\n2\n\nDepartment of Engineering Physics and Center for Astrophysics, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084,\nChina\n4\n\nDepartment of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester, University Road, Leicester, LE1 7RH,\n\nUK\n3\n\nDepartment of Physics, Astronomy Division, P.O. Box 3000, 90014 University of Oulu, Finland\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nMakishima et al. 2000). Alternatively, ULXs may represent a class of super-Eddington emitters and probe a regime in which the accretion rate is much higher than that seen in Galactic\nblack hole binaries (GBHBs; see Roberts 2007 for a recent review). The reality is probably\nmore complex than a single answer, with some ULXs being possibly slightly more massive\nthan stellar mass black holes (MULX . 100 M\u2299 ) but still experiencing super-Eddington accretion to some degree. In addition, mild beaming may be present (Poutanen et al. 2007;\nKing 2009).\nRecently, the Swift observatory has been used to follow up some of the most luminous\nULXs (Kaaret & Feng 2009) and has allowed studies that span a few months to a year with\nmany observations, compared to the previous deeper but sparse Chandra/XMM-Newton observations. The results from these observations have shown that their flux varies significantly\nby factors of 5\u201310 on timescales of days to weeks (Kaaret & Feng 2009). In NGC 5408 X1, a 115 day orbital period has been suggested (Strohmayer 2009). Somewhat unexpectedly, most of the ULXs monitored with Swift to date (Holmberg IX X-1, NGC 5408 X1, and NGC 4395 X-2) do not show pronounced spectral changes (Kaaret & Feng 2009;\nVierdayanti et al. 2010). The exception is the Hyperluminous X-ray source (LX \u2265 1041 erg s\u22121 ;\nGao et al. 2003) HLX-1 (Farrell et al. 2009) which shows X-ray variability (by a factor of\n> 20) but associated with spectral variability (Godet et al. 2009).\nHere, we report on a set of new Swift observations aimed at studying Holmberg II X1 (HoII X-1 hereafter). This source is a luminous ULX (LX up to 2 \u00d7 1040 erg s\u22121 ; e.g.\nFeng & Kaaret 2009), located in the dwarf galaxy Holmberg II, at an estimated distance\nd = 3.39 Mpc (Karachentsev et al. 2002). In optical wavelengths, the ULX is surrounded by\nthe \"foot nebula\" (Pakull & Mirioni 2002) which is powered by reprocessing of X-rays and\nhas enabled demonstration, using the He II\u03bb4686 nebular recombination line, that the true\nX-ray luminosity is close to that inferred from the X-ray flux assuming isotropic emission,\nthus excluding strong beaming effects for this source (Pakull & Mirioni 2002; Kaaret et al.\n2004). This has been confirmed by an infrared study (Berghea et al. 2010), using the [O IV]\n25.89 \u03bcm emission line. This ULX has also been studied extensively in the X-ray band\n(Zezas et al. 1999; Miyaji et al. 2001; Dewangan et al. 2004; Stobbart et al. 2006; Goad et al.\n2006; Feng & Kaaret 2009; Gladstone et al. 2009; Kajava & Poutanen 2009; Caballero-Garc\u0131\u0301a & Fabian\n2010) and has been seen with 0.3\u201310 keV luminosities ranging from a few 1039 to \u223c 2 \u00d7\n1040 erg s\u22121 .\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n2.\n\nObservations and data analysis\n\nWe obtained 68 observations under Swift program 90217 (PI: Kaaret) and also analyzed\n6 observations obtained under program 35475. All these observations were carried out using\nthe X-ray Telescope (XRT) instrument in its photon-counting (PC) mode. The first data\nset is contiguous and spans 131 days from 2009 December to 2010 April and the second one\ncomes from observations executed in 2006. We retrieved level 2 event files from all these\nobservations. Thus, we used the default data screening parameters as described in the XRT\nuser's guide1 . Each observation is composed of one or more snapshots. We analyzed each\nsnapshot separately, rejecting the ones with an exposure time below 100 s. We were left with\n124 snapshots.\nWe extracted source counts from a circular region with a radius of 20 pixels (\u223c 47\u2032\u2032 ,\ncorresponding to 90% of the point-spread function at 1.5 keV) and background counts from\nan annulus with an inner radius of 50 pixels (\u223c 118\u2032\u2032 ) and an outer radius of 120 pixels\n(\u223c 283\u2032\u2032 ). The same regions were chosen to extract the spectra. The count rates and spectra\nwere corrected for the loss of flux due to bad pixels and bad columns. For this, an exposure\nmap was generated for each snapshot and used to create an auxiliary response file (ARF).\nThe light curves were binned at 1 day averages to increase statistics. We also calculated a\nhardness ratio, defined as the ratio between the net count rate in the 1.5\u201310 keV band versus\nthe 0.3\u20131.5 keV band.\nWe co-added spectra using three different count rate ranges (see Table 1) and keeping\nthe 2006 data separate, using the ADDSPEC FTOOL2 . Thus, we ended up with four co-added\nspectra, which we refer to throughout the Letter as spectra 1, 2, 3, and 4 (Table 1) where\nspectrum 2 is the spectrum for the 2006 data. The ARFs were co-added separately using\nADDARF and weighted accordingly to their counts. Response matrix files (RMFs) were taken\nfrom the calibration database according to the date of the observations. Concretely, we\nused the RMF swxpc0to12s0_20010101v011.rmf for the 2006 observations and the RMF\nswxpc0to12s6_20070901v011.rmf for the 2009/2010 observations. GRPPHA was used to bin\nthe spectra with at least 20 counts in each bin. Finally, we fitted the spectra using XSPEC\n12.6.0 (Arnaud 1996).\n1\n\nCan be found at http://heasarc.nasa.gov/docs/swift/analysis/\n\n2\n\nWe used FTOOLS 6.9, the latest version being available at http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftools/\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n3.\n\nResults\n\nThe X-ray light curve of HoII X-1 (Figure 1) shows significant variability, with count\nrates ranging from 0.02 to 0.28 counts s\u22121 . We calculated a periodogram from the 0.3\u201310\nkeV light curve from the 2009/2010 data set, covering 131 days starting at MJD 55166, using\nthe method of Horne & Baliunas (1986) for periods in the range of 4\u201365 days. We found no\nsignificant peaks in the resulting power spectrum.\nThe hardness/intensity diagram (HID) is shown in Figure 2. The data from the 2009/2010\ndata set show a slight trend where the hardness ratio increases with the count rate. This is\nconfirmed by a \u03c72 test when we test for the null hypothesis of constant hardness. We get an\naverage hardness of 0.34 \u00b1 0.01 and \u03c72 = 150.6 for 54 degrees of freedom (DoF), ruling out\nconstant hardness. A linear fit to the 2009/2010 data shows a good correlation between the\nhardness ratio and the rate, with a slope of 0.98 \u00b1 0.10 and a corresponding \u03c72 for the fit of\n52.2 for 53 DoF.\nHowever, the 2006 observations show a clear offset in hardness with a mean value of\n0.68 \u00b1 0.03, at a mean count rate of 0.159 \u00b1 0.004 counts s\u22121 . At the same count rate, the\nmean hardness ratio is 0.38 \u00b1 0.04 in the 2009/2010 data. Clearly, the hardness ratio is not\nsolely a function of the count rate.\nWe start the analysis of the spectra (Table 1 and Figure 3) by using the most simple\nmodel, i.e., an absorbed power-law continuum. We fix the galactic H I column density to\n3.4 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 (Dickey & Lockman 1990) and allow for intrinsic absorption. The \u03c72 of\nthe individual fits are statistically acceptable, except for spectrum 1. Spectra 1, 3, and 4\nshow a consistent extragalactic absorption with a value of \u223c 0.15 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 and spectrum\n2 shows a lower absorption with 0.05 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 . The intrinsic column density is thus\nin reasonable agreement with previous studies (e.g., Feng & Kaaret 2009) except the lower\nvalue for spectrum 2. Using the multicolor disk (MCD) blackbody model alone leads to a\nvery bad fit, with a reduced \u03c72 above 2.0 for all individual fits.\nAdding an MCD component to the power-law model improves the fits significantly in\nspectra 1 and 4, with \u2206\u03c72 = 22.5 and 19.4 for 2 additional DoF. The inner-disk temperature\nis consistent within the errors between the different spectra, with a value of \u223c 0.20 keV,\nin agreement with results reported by other authors (e.g., Feng & Kaaret 2009). After we\nfitted the power-law index separately, we found that spectra 1 and 4 had the same index\n+0.14\nwithin the errors (\u03931 = 2.80+0.23\n\u22120.22 , \u03934 = 2.57\u22120.16 ), consistent with the small evolution of\nthe hardness ratio. Spectrum 3 which has fewer counts shows a compatible index but with\na larger error (\u03933 = 2.20+0.46\n\u22120.69 ). Considering the relatively small variation in hardness ratio\nover the 2009/2010 data, which may be due to a changing fraction of flux in the soft thermal\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\ncomponent, we decided to tie these three indices together. The fit statistics are similar with\n\u03c72 /DoF = 380.2/375 when the photon indices are independent and \u03c72 /DoF = 384.4/377\nwhen not. We note that the \"bump\" we see in the residuals of the fit (Figure 3) between\n2 and 5 keV is likely to be a real feature in the spectra (as seen in a recent XMM-Newton\nspectrum; J.J.E Kajava et al., in preparation). This \"bump\" is most apparent in spectrum\n1, where the reduced \u03c72 of the fit is \u223c 1.2. More complicated models should be able to\nmodel that feature but here we are limited by statistics.\nThe power-law plus MCD model has been proven to be very effective in the study of black\nhole X-ray binaries and has been used extensively with the moderate signal-to-noise spectra\nof ULXs, leading to claims of the presence of IMBHs (Kaaret et al. 2003; Miller et al. 2003)\ndue to the presence of a soft excess. But this excess may also arise from the emission of an outflow at a large distance (spherization radius) from the central source (Poutanen et al. 2007;\nKajava & Poutanen 2009). Recently, some authors have shown that more physical models\ncould be applied to high-quality spectra of ULXs. Stobbart et al. (2006) and Gladstone et al.\n(2009) use a Comptonization model that reflects the coronal emission (and thus replaces the\npower law) in addition to a disk model. Caballero-Garc\u0131\u0301a & Fabian (2010) have applied a\nmodel based on a ionized disk reflection and power-law continuum. We attempted to apply one of the Comptonization models (DISKPN + COMPTT, in XSPEC) used by Gladstone et al.\n(2009) to our spectra but the fits suffer from huge uncertainties in the fitted parameters.\nWe also summed all the 2009/2010 spectra but were still unable to constrain the model\nparameters.\nIt is apparent from the spectra (Figure 3) and spectral parameters (Table 1) that there\nare significant changes that are not only a function of the luminosity, as already seen in\nthe HID. Spectra 1, 3, and 4 share the same power-law index (\u0393 \u223c 2.6) and inner-disk\ntemperature (Tin \u223c 0.20 keV) within the errors although there is a factor of \u223c 5 difference\nin luminosity between spectra 1 and 4. The data from 2006 (spectrum 2) definitely show a\nharder power-law index (\u0393 \u223c 1.8), but with the same Tin and a luminosity close to spectrum 3.\n\n4.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIf we attempt a comparison with the spectral states of GBHBs, the power-law index of\nspectra 1, 3, and 4, which are typical of what has been seen during previous observations\n(\u0393 \u223c 2.6) would be consistent with some kind of soft state. The thermal-dominant state\nas defined by McClintock & Remillard (2006) implies a disk-flux fraction above 75% and a\npower-density spectrum with no quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) or very weak features.\nThe timing properties would be consistent here since the X-ray variability of HoII X-1 is weak\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n\nTable 1: Spectral Fit Parameters\nNo.a\n\nCount Rateb\n\nnH c\n(1022 cm\u22122 )\n0.15+0.02\n\u22120.02\n\n1\n\n< 0.10\n\n2\n\n0.10-0.20 (2006)\n\n3\n\n0.10-0.20\n\n4\n\n> 0.20\n\n0.16+0.02\n\u22120.02\n\n1\n\n< 0.10\n\n0.21+0.10\n\u22120.07\n\n2\n\n0.10-0.20 (2006)\n\n3\n\n0.10-0.20\n\n4\n\n0.05+0.02\n\u22120.02\n\n0.15+0.05\n\u22120.04\n\n\u0393d\n\n3.15+0.09\n\u22120.09\n\n1.98+0.12\n\u22120.11\n\n2.93+0.25\n\u22120.28\n\n2.79+0.09\n\u22120.09\n\n2.80+0.23\n\u22120.22\n\nTin e\n\n...\n\nFluxf\n(\u00d710\u221212 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 )\nPower-law\n1.3+0.1\n\u22120.2\n\n...\n...\n...\n\n5.6+0.4\n\u22120.4\n\n4.2+0.3\n\u22120.6\n\n6.7+0.3\n\u22120.2\n\nPower-law + disk blackbody\n0.15 +0.04\n1.3+0.1\n\u22120.03\n\u22120.6\n\nLX g\n(\u00d71040 erg s\u22121 )\n0.49+0.1\n\u22120.07\n\n0.97+0.05\n\u22120.04\n1.4+0.5\n\u22120.3\n\n2.2+0.2\n\u22120.1\n\n0.67+0.7\n\u22120.2\n\nh\n\nfX\n\nMCD\n\n...\n\n122.5 (85)\n\n...\n\n71.8 (82)\n\n...\n\n41.6 (38)\n\n...\n\n204.1 (178)\n\n0.51+0.49\n\u22120.34\n\n0.05+0.05\n\u22120.04\n\n1.77+0.20\n\u22120.26\n\n0.29 +0.13\n\u22120.10\n\n5.8+0.8\n\u22122.7\n\n> 0.20\n\n0.18+0.05\n\u22120.04\n\n2.57+0.14\n\u22120.16\n\n0.19 +0.05\n\u22120.04\n\n6.9+0.4\n\u22120.8\n\n1\n\n< 0.10\n\n0.17+0.07\n\u22120.05\n\n2.61+0.10\n\u22120.12\n\n0.17 +0.03\n\u22120.03\n\n1.3+0.1\n\u22120.6\n\n0.52+0.3\n\u22120.1\n\n0.49+0.51\n\u22120.26\n\n2\n\n0.10-0.20 (2006)\n\n0.06\u22120.04\n\n1.77\u22120.27\n\n5.8\u22122.9\n\n1.0\u22120.1\n\n0.14\u22120.10\n\n3\n\n0.10-0.20\n\n0.28 \u22120.09\n0.19 +0.06\n\u22120.05\n\n4\n\n> 0.20\n\n6.8+0.2\n\u22121.9\n\n2.3+0.7\n\u22120.3\n\n0.26+0.26\n\u22120.13\n\n0.13+0.11\n\u22120.09\n\n2.20+0.46\n\u22120.69\n\n0.22 +0.10\n\u22120.06\n\n4.5+0.3\n\u22124.5\n\n\u03c72 /DoFi\n\n100.0 (83)\n\n1.0+0.1\n\u22120.1\n\n0.14+0.11\n\u22120.10\n\n66.7 (80)\n\n2.2+0.6\n\u22120.4\n\n0.26+0.24\n\u22120.12\n\n184.7 (176)\n\n1.2+1.0\n\u22120.2\n\n0.47+0.53\n\u22120.24\n\n28.8 (36)\n\nPower-law + disk blackbody with \u03931 = \u03933 = \u03934\n+0.05\n\n0.18+0.12\n\u22120.06\n\n0.18+0.05\n\u22120.04\n\n+0.21\n\n2.61\n2.61\n\n+0.13\n\n0.19 +0.04\n\u22120.03\n\n+1.0\n\n4.3+0.2\n\u22121.7\n\n+0.1\n\n1.5+1.5\n\u22120.4\n\n+0.12\n\n0.39+0.61\n\u22120.26\n\n384.4 (377)\n\nNote. - a Spectrum index used in the text ; b Count rate range used to create the spectrum ; c External\nabsorption column ; d Power-law photon index ; e Inner-disk temperature ; f Absorbed flux (0.3\u201310 keV) ;\ng\nUnabsorbed luminosity (0.3\u201310 keV) for D = 3.39 Mpc ; h Fraction of the total unabsorbed flux (0.3\u201310\nkeV) in the disk component ; i \u03c72 and degrees of freedom. All errors are at the 90% confidence level. The\ntotal number of counts in each of the four combined spectra is respectively 2314, 1940, 943, and 5368 counts\nfor spectra 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\non short timescales (Goad et al. 2006), but the fraction of the flux in the disk component\nis below 50 % (with the caveat that the errors on the fractions are huge). Thus, it appears\nthat in 2009/2010 the ULX would be classified as being in the steep power-law state where\nthe power-law component contributes more than 50% without the presence of QPOs.\nSpectrum 2 shows a power-law index (\u0393 \u223c 1.8) that would be indicative of the hard\nstate. The disk component contributes \u223c 14% of the total X-ray flux which would be\nconsistent with the fraction seen in GBHB in this state. However, the temperature is the\nsame, within errors, in all the spectra. This is unlike the behavior in GBHB, where the\ndisk blackbody usually has a temperature well below that in the soft states (Belloni 2001;\nRodriguez et al. 2003; Remillard & McClintock 2006). The properties of the soft thermal\ncomponent in the spectra of HoII X-1 are unlike the behavior expected for a disk blackbody.\nThus, interpretation of the spectral states of HoII X-1 in terms of the canonical states at\nGBHBs in which the thermal emission arises from an accretion disk is not valid.\nThis particular ULX was only seen once in such a hard-like state (and at a similar\nluminosity than the Swift 2006 data; Miyaji et al. 2001) although it has been observed many\ntimes. Looking at the hardness ratios, it appears that HoII X-1 stayed in this state during\nthe three Swift observations executed in 2006 although they were separated by \u223c 40 days.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nSince HoII X-1 has been caught only once before in such a state and the recent coverage\nof \u223c 130 days does not show such a hard power-law index, interesting questions are raised\nsuch as does this \"transition\" happen rarely and how long does it last. We note that the\nevolutionary sequence of Gladstone et al. (2009) using Comptonized models is constructed\nas a function of luminosity and does not include the behavior seen here. Also, the constancy\nof the parameters of the disk component, discussed above, would require the corona to vary\nso as to cancel out the changes in the true disk temperature, which seems unlikely. It is\nalso worth noting that the few persistent GBHBs behave quite differently compared to the\ntransient ones. Indeed, objects like LMC X-1, LMC X-3, or Cyg X-1 spend most of their\ntime in either the soft state or the hard state with only a few transitions (Belloni 2010, and\nreferences therein). From a strictly spectral hardness point of view, HoII X-1 also seems\nto spend most of its time in a soft state. Other ULXs like Holmberg IX X-1 seem to be,\ninstead, locked in some kind of hard state (Kaaret & Feng 2009). We also note that the ULX\nNGC 1313 X-1 was seen in two different \"states\" at a similar luminosity (Feng & Kaaret\n2006), hence showing an analogous behavior to HoII X-1.\nOn the other hand, the 2009/10 light curve reveals that HoII X-1 experiences rapid flares\nthat are not tied to spectral changes (i.e., the hardness ratio does not vary much). These\nflares occur on timescales shorter than the spacing between the observations, < 2 days with\na mean amplitude of \u223c 0.15 counts s\u22121 (absorbed flux/unabsorbed luminosity amplitudes of\n\u223c 4.5 \u00d7 10\u221212 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 /1.2 \u00d7 1040 erg s\u22121 ). If we consider all the snapshots without any\nadditional binning, there are two cases that are indicative of a consecutive flux rise and decay\nin less than half a day each. Other ULXs also show large X-ray variability without significant\nchanges in their spectral hardness (Kaaret & Feng 2009). The irregular flaring activity that\nwe see here seems very similar to that of Holmberg IX X-1 (Kaaret & Feng 2009) and could\nbe also compared to the variability of the GBHB GRS 1915+105, which exhibits rapid flares\n(on timescales of minutes) that are associated with specific variability patterns (Belloni et al.\n2000) and interpreted as an instability in the radiation pressure dominated part of the disk\n(Janiuk et al. 2000).\nWe have shown that the ULX HoII X-1 demonstrates X-ray variability by an average\nfactor of \u223c 5 on timescales of days to months. Over 4 months in 2009/2010, its spectral\nproperties did not vary much, with only a slight increase of the hardness ratio associated\nwith an increase in the count rate. During that interval, its spectrum was soft with a steep\npower-law component and a soft thermal component, similar to that seen during a number of\nprevious observations (e.g., Goad et al. 2006; Feng & Kaaret 2009). Only the fraction of flux\nin the soft thermal component has been seen to vary as a function of X-ray luminosity. This\nquasi-absence of spectral variability over large changes in flux has been observed in other\nULXs (Kaaret & Feng 2009). But if we add the 2006 data, the HID becomes non-monotonic:\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nthe hardness ratio is higher and correspondingly the spectrum shows a harder power law,\nconsistent with the hard state, although its luminosity is close to two of the other spectra.\nThe thermal component appears at a temperature close to that seen in the soft spectra,\nwhich argues strongly against interpreting that component as due to disk emission. Thus,\nwhile HoII X-1 appears to exhibit hard versus soft states similar to GBHBs, interpretation of\nthe thermal component in terms of GBHB states is likely invalid. Even though our spectral\nanalysis is limited by the use of simple and somewhat empirical models, there are spectral\nchanges that are clearly not associated with flux changes. This behavior means that, as\nwith GBHBs (Homan et al. 2001), at least two parameters determine the accretion state of\nthis system and that the accretion rate is not the only variable responsible for spectral state\nchanges.\nTo understand the physics involved, deeper spectra at different count rates and hardness\nratios are needed. The unprecedented coverage possible with Swift has led to new insights\ninto the behavior of ULXs. Combined use of Swift with larger X-ray telescopes could lead\nto a better understanding of the evolution of the spectral properties of ULXs.\n\nAcknowledgments\nH.F. is supported by the NSFC under grants 10903004 and 10978001 and by the 973\nprogram 2009CB824800.
