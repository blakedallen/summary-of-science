An approximate formula for time-evolution of the reduced\ndensity matrix of a system interacting with a quantum chaotic environment is derived. This theoretical formulation is substantiated by numerical study of decoherence of two qubits interacting\nwith a quantum chaotic environment modeled by chaotic kicked top. Like many-body model of\nenvironment, quantum chaotic system is efficient decoherer, and it can generate entanglement\nbetween the two qubits which have no direct interaction.\n\nInteraction of a quantum system with environment creates correlations between the states of the system and of\nthe environment. These correlations destroy the superposition of the system states - a phenomenon known as\ndecoherence [1]. This phenomenon is believed to be responsible for quantum to classical transition. Decoherence\nis also a major obstacle for designing quantum computational and informational protocol [2]. Therefore, a deeper\nunderstanding of the phenomenon is required to address\nthe fundamental question like quantum-classical transition\nand, to develop quantum computational protocol.\nIn general, the environment is modeled by many-body\nsystem, e.g. infinitely many harmonic oscillators in thermal equilibrium (Feynman-Vernon or Caldeira-Leggett\nmodel) [3], spin-boson model [4], chaotic spin-chain [5],\netc. In another approach, random matrix model of the\nenvironment is used [6,7]. Random matrix theory has well\nknown connections with quantum chaotic systems. Hence,\nsome studies have concentrated on the possibility of having quantum dissipation and decoherence due to the interaction with chaotic degrees of freedom [8]. Recently, as a\nmodel of decohering environment, single particle quantum\nchaotic system has been considered [9]. This paper shows\nthat the kicked rotator, a well studied model of chaotic\nsystem, can reproduce the decohering effects of a manybody environment. In comparison to complex many-body\nsystem, this simple deterministic system is very convenient\nfor numerical as well as analytical studies of decoherence.\nHence, single particle quantum chaotic system warrants a\n\n(a) Present address : Department of Physics, National University\nof Singapore, 117542, Singapore\n\nspecial attention as a model of decohering environment.\nIn this Letter, we establish direct equivalence of single particle quantum chaotic environment and CaldeiraLeggett type model of many-body environment by providing a rigorous but straightforward treatment. We keep\nour results vis-a-vis a recent study in which decoherence\nin a quantum system is investigated under the influence of\na collection of harmonic oscillators environment [10]. Our\nderivation first assumes weak interaction between the system and the environment. Using the interaction strength\nas a small parameter, we perform perturbative theory calculation. By exponentiating the perturbative expansion,\nwe get an approximate formula for the non-perturbative\nstrong interaction effect of the environment on the system.\nThe approximate formula is then justified by numerical\nevidences. In numerics, we study decoherence of two noninteracting qubits which are individually interacting with\na common quantum chaotic environment. We use chaotic\nkicked top, a very well studied model of quantum chaotic\nsystem [11], as the environment.\nMost general form of the Hamiltonian of a system S, interacting with an environment E, is H = HS + HE + HSE ,\nwhere HS and HE are the Hamiltonians of the system\nand the environment, respectively, and HSE is the systemenvironment coupling Hamiltonian. We assume throughout this Letter that the decoherence time is much smaller\nthan the system characteristic time. Hence we can neglect any dynamics of the isolated system and can discard\nHS . We consider kicked quantum chaotic system as a\nmodel of the environment, so the general form of the timedependent system-environment Hamiltonian is : H(t) =\n\n\fJayendra N. Bandyopadhyay1\nP\nIS \u2297 HE (t) + HI (t) where HE (t) = H1 + H2 n \u03b4(t \u2212 n)\nand HI (t) = \u03b1VS \u2297 VE ; VS and VE are the coupling\nagents of the system and the environment, respectively.\nParameter \u03b1 determines the strength of the interaction.\nWe now assume that VE commutes with H1 . This is\na very natural assumption as it separates environment\ndynamics from the system-environment interaction. The\ncorresponding time-evolution operator U in between two\nconsecutive kicks is: U = UI U0 = UI (IS \u2297 UE ), where\nthe coupling part UI = exp(\u2212i\u03b1VS \u2297 VE ), IS is a unit\nmatrix which indicates the absence of any dynamics in\nthe system, and UE = exp(\u2212iH1 ) exp(\u2212iH2 ). Further,\nwe assume that the initial joint state of the systemenvironment is an unentangled pure state of the form\n|\u03a8SE (0)i = |\u03c8S (0)i \u2297 |\u03c8E (0)i. We measure decoherence\nof the system by its loss of purity P (n) \u2261 TrS [\u03c1S (n)2 ]\nwhich varies from 1, for pure state, to 1/NS for completely\nmixed state, NS being the Hilbert space dimension of S.\nAnd \u03c1S (n) \u2261 TrE |\u03a8SE (n)ih\u03a8SE (n)| is the system reduced\ndensity matrix (RDM), where |\u03a8SE (n)i is the joint state\nof the system and the environment at time n.\nWe are interested to study entanglement between the\ntwo non-interacting qubits due to their interaction with\na common chaotic environment. Following Wootters, the\nentanglement is measured by computing\nthe\n\u221a\n\u221a concurrence\n\u221a\nC[\u03c1\n(n)]\n=\nmax(\u039b,\n0),\nwhere\n\u039b\n\u2261\n\u03bb\n\u2212\n\u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bb3 \u2212\nS\n1\n\u221a\n\u03bb4 and \u03bbi 's are the eigenvalues of the matrix R(n) =\n\u22c6\n\u22c6\n^\n\u03c1S (n)\u03c1^\nS (n); \u03c1S (n) \u2261 (\u03c3y \u2297 \u03c3y )\u03c1S (n) (\u03c3y \u2297 \u03c3y ), \u03c1S (n)\nbeing the complex conjugation of \u03c1S (n) in the computational basis {|00i, |01i, |10i, |11i} [12]. The concurrence\nvaries from 0, for separable state, to 1 for maximally entangled state.\nOur perturbation theory approach is reminiscent of\nthe method followed by Tanaka et. al. in the context\nof entanglement production between two coupled chaotic\nsystems [13]. We define the interaction picture of the\njoint density matrix \u03c1SE (n) \u2261 U0 (n)\u2020 \u03c1SE (n)U0 (n), and\nof any arbitrary operator O(n) \u2261 U0 (n)\u2020 OU0 (n), where\nU0 (n) \u2261 (IS \u2297UE )n , and O(n) represents the free evolution\nof O. Thus, the time evolution of \u03c1SE (n) is determined\nby the mapping : \u03c1SE (n) = UI (n)\u03c1SE (n \u2212 1)UI (n)\u2020 . The\nperturbative expansion for UI (n) is :\n1\nUI (n) = 1 \u2212 i\u03b1V (n) \u2212 \u03b12 V (n)2 + O(\u03b13 ),\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere V (n) \u2261 VS (n) \u2297 VE (n), VS (n) and VE (n) are as\nusual free evolutions of VS and VE , respectively. We\nintroduce the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of VS as\nVS |si = \u03bbs |si. By tracing out the environment, we obtain\nperturbative expansion of RDM of the system S at time\nn in the eigenbasis of VS upto O(\u03b12 ) as :\n\u0014\n1\n[\u03c1S (n)]ss\u2032 \u2243 1 \u2212 i \u03b1(\u03bbs \u2212 \u03bbs\u2032 )g(n) \u2212 \u03b12 (\u03bbs \u2212 \u03bbs\u2032 )2 g(n)2\n2\n\u0015\n2\n2 2\n2\n2\n\u2212\u03b1 (\u03bbs \u2212 \u03bbs\u2032 ) f (n)\u2212i \u03b1 (\u03bbs \u2212 \u03bbs\u2032 )\u03c6(n) [\u03c1S (0)]ss\u2032 ,\n(2)\n\nwhere g(n) \u2261\nf (n) \u2261\n\u03a6(n) \u2261\n\u2212\n\nPn\n\nl=1 hVE (l)i,\n\nand\n\nRe \u03a6(n) ; \u03c6(n) \u2261 Im \u03a6(n),\nn X\nl\u22121 D\nn\nE X\nE\n1 XD\nVE (l)VE (l\u2032 )\nVE (l)2 +\n2\nl=2 l\u2032 =1\nl=1\n!2\nn\nD\nE\n1 X\nVE (l)\n.\n(3)\n2\nl=1\n\nHere, h \u2022 i \u2261 Tr{\u03c1E (0) \u2022} is an average over the environment. We extend the range of validity of the perturbative\nexpansion by exponentiating Eq. (2)\n\u0002\n[\u03c1S (n)]ss\u2032 \u2243 exp \u2212 i \u03b1(\u03bbs \u2212 \u03bbs\u2032 )g(n) \u2212 \u03b12 (\u03bbs \u2212 \u03bbs\u2032 )2 f (n)\n\u0003\n\u2212 i \u03b12 (\u03bb2s \u2212 \u03bb2s\u2032 )\u03c6(n) [\u03c1S (0)]ss\u2032 , (4)\n\nand our numerics suggest that this expression works well\neven in strong coupling regime. The same approximation was also taken in random matrix study of quantum\nfidelity decay [14], which later justified by supersymmetry calculation [15]. This approximation is also verified in\nexperimental study of fidelity decay in quantum chaotic\nsystem [16].\nThe most important term in Eq. (4) is the function\nf (n), which is responsible for the decay of the off-diagonal\nterms of the RDM, leading to the loss of coherence of the\nsystem. Hence, we call the function f (n) as \"decoherence function\". We get rid of the term g(n) by redefining\nVE (l) \u2261 VE (l) \u2212 VE (l) . Then Eq. (4) will be exactly\nidentical to the expression obtained for the environment\nconsisting of a collection of harmonic oscillators [17]. However, it does not prove the equivalence of both the expressions. In order to do so, we have to show that the decoherence function f (n) is equivalent to the decoherence\nfunction of Ref. [10].\nIn the following, we closely look at the properties of the\ndecoherence function f (n). From the definition of f (n)\ngiven in Eq. (3), and after doing some algebra, we get:\nn\n\nf (n) =\n\nn\n\n1 XX\nCE (l, l\u2032 ),\n2\n\u2032\n\n(5)\n\nl=1 l =1\n\nwhere CE (l, l\u2032 ) is the correlation function of the uncoupled\nchaotic environment given by\nCE (l, l\u2032 ) = VE (l)VE (l\u2032 ) \u2212 VE (l) VE (l\u2032 ) .\n\n(6)\n\nHere we assume that the environment is strongly chaotic,\nand the phase space of its underlying classical system is\nbounded. Following Ref. [13], we assume further phenomenological properties of CE (l, l\u2032 ) : (1) In strongly\nchaotic regime, the distribution function quickly becomes\nuniform in the phase space, hence CE (l, l) = VE (l)2 \u2212\n2\n\nVE (l) becomes almost constant within a very short\ntime. So we assume CE (l, l) \u2243 C0 for all time. (2) CE (l, l\u2032 )\nexponentially decays with the time-interval |l \u2212 l\u2032| with an\n\n\fQuantum chaotic system as a model of decohering environment\n\nHence, the rate of change of f (n) with time n is :\n\u0014\n\u0010 \u03b3 \u0011 \u03b3 exp(\u2212\u03b3n) \u0015\n1\n\u2206f (n)\n\u2212\n.\n\u2243 C0 coth\n\u2206n\n2\n2\nsinh \u03b3 \u2212 1\n\n\u03b1=0.0001\n\n\u03b1=0.001\n\n\u03b1=0.005\n\n\u03b1=0.0001\n\n\u03b1=0.001\n\n\u03b1=0.005\n\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n1\n0.8\n\n\u039b\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n(8)\n\n0.2\n0\n\n0\n\n1000 2000 3000 0\n\ntime(n)\n\nAt the beginning, when n is very small,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2206f (n)\nC0 \u03b3 2\n1\nn + const. ,\n\u2243\n\u2206n\n2 sinh \u03b3 \u2212 1\n\n500\n\n1000 0\n\n50\n\n100\n\ntime(n)\n\ntime(n)\n\nFig. 1: (Color online) Evolution of the system purity P (n),\n\n(9) and the parameter \u039b determines the entanglement in the sys2\n\ni.e., f (n) evolves quadratically with time (f (n) \u221d n ).

Identical behavior of the\ndecoherence function is reported for the the environment\nconsisting of a collection of harmonic oscillators [10]. Thus\nwe finally arrive at our goal, and prove that quantum\nchaotic system and a collection of harmonic oscillators behave equivalently as a model of decohering environment.\nWe now substantiate our results with numerics. Here we\nconsider chaotic kicked top as the model of environment.\nThe total Hamiltonian is H(t) = HI (t) + HE (t) where\nHI (t) is the system-environment interaction Hamiltonian,\nand HE (t) is the kicked top Hamiltonian. As the environment, following version of the kicked top model is used:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c0 X\nk\n\u03b4(t \u2212 n),\n(11)\nHE (t) = \u03b2Jz + Jz2 + Jy\n2j\n2\nn\nwhere Ji is the i-th component of the angular momentum\noperator of the top, j is the size of the spin (here, j = 100),\nk is the parameter which decides chaoticity in the system.\nThe most popular version of the kicked top model does\nnot contain the \u03b2-term. We introduce this extra term\nto remove the parity symmetry RH(t)R\u22121 = H(t), where\nR = exp(i\u03c0Jy ). The Hilbert space dimension of the kicked\ntop is N = 2j + 1 = 201. We set the chaotic parameter at\nk = 99.0 which corresponds to classically strongly chaotic\nsystem, and the parameter \u03b2 at 0.47. The interaction\nHamiltonian between the two qubits and the kicked top\nis:\nHI (t) = \u03b1hs \u2297 Jz .\n(12)\nThe parameter \u03b1 determines the system-environment\ncoupling strength. The system consists of two non(1)\ninteracting qubits, and its coupling agent is hs = Sz \u2297\n\ntem are plotted for three different system-environment coupling\nstrengths \u03b1 = 0.0001, 0.001, 0.005. Here the initial state is the\nBell state (see the text). The dotted line is the exact numerical\ncalculation, whereas the solid line is the theoretical estimation.\nWe estimate P (n) and \u039b from the approximate formula of the\nRDM \u03c1S of the system given in Eq. (4).\n\n(2)\n\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\nI (2) + I (1) \u2297 Sz , where Sz = \u03c3z /2 and \u03c3z is third\nPauli matrix. Hence, the computational basis states\n{|00i, |01i, |10i, |11i} are also the eigenbasis of hs with\neigenvalues {\u22121, 0, 0, 1}. The states |01i and |10i are the\ndegenerate eigenstates of hs . Note that, according to Eq.\n(4), the off-diagonal terms of the system state, corresponding to this degenerate subspace, will not decay with time.\nDecoherence of the system is studied for two different\n\u0001\ninitial states : (1) a Bell state |\u03c6s i = \u221a12 |00i \u2212 |11i , and\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(2) a product state |\u03c6s i = \u221a12 |0i\u2212|1i \u2297 \u221a12 |0i+|1i . For\nall numerical studies, a generalized SU (2) coherent state\n[11] is used as initial state for the kicked top environment.\nFig. 1 presents the result for the Bell state case. In\nthe computational basis, diagonal elements of the initial density matrix \u03c1S (0) are (1/2, 0, 0, 1/2), and two offdiagonal elements have non-zero values : h00|\u03c1S (0)|11i =\nh11|\u03c1S (0)|00i = \u22121/2. These off-diagonal elements are\nnot the part of the degenerate subspace, and therefore\nthey decay in time. So in the asymptotic limit : \u03c1S \u2243\ndiag (1/2, 0, 0, 1/2), the purity P and \u039b of this RDM are\n1/2 and 0, respectively. In Fig. 1, we see that the purity P\nand \u039b have reached very close to these asymptotic values.\nThe rate, at which these two quantities have reached the\nasymptotic values, is determined by the coupling strength\n\u03b1. As expected, for weaker coupling the rate is slower\nthan stronger coupling. The most important fact is that\nour approximate formula for the RDM derived from the\nperturbation theory, is not only working well for the weak\ncoupling case but also agrees very well for the stronger\ncoupling cases.\nFig. 2 presents the result for the product state case. Initially \u039b = 0, and then it becomes negative till n = 1142\nfor \u03b1 = 0.0001, n = 81 for \u03b1 = 0.001, and n = 4\nfor \u03b1 = 0.005.

Other parameters and\ndescriptions are same as in Fig. 1.\n\ntwo qubits determined by the concurrence was zero. After that, there is a time interval when \u039b > 0, and the\ntwo qubits become entangled due to their common interaction with the chaotic environment. This shows that,\nlike many-body environment [18], quantum chaotic environment can also generate entanglement between two\nnon-interacting qubits which have no entanglement initially. In the asymptotic limit, diagonal elements of \u03c1S\n: (1/4, 1/4, \u22121/4, \u22121.4), and the off-diagonal elements :\nh01|\u03c1S |10i = h10|\u03c1S |01i = \u22121/4 corresponding to the degenerate subspace, survive from decoherence. Therefore,\nin this limit, the purity P = 3/8 = 0.375, and \u039b = 0. Figure shows again a good agreement between the numerics\nand the theory.\nOur theoretical formulation establishes the equivalence\nbetween quantum chaotic environment and many-body\nenvironment by showing the equivalence between their\ndecoherence function f (n). Therefore, it is very important to investigate f (n) of the kicked top carefully. In\nFig. 3, we plot the evolution of the decoherence function of the kicked top. Our numerical experiment suggests that the phenomenological formula for f (n) given\nin Eq. (7) is not an exact formula for all time n. It\ndescribes short time quadratic and long time linear behavior well. So instead of fitting the numerics by the\nphenomenological formula, we interpolate it with a simple function f (n) = an + bn2 , a combination of a linear\nand a quadratic term. The interpolation (solid line of Fig.\n3) gives a \u2243 0.1776 and b \u2243 1.1561 \u00d7 10\u22123 . We expect\nthe parameter a to be equal to the coefficient of the linear term of Eq. (7), i.e. 12 C0 coth(\u03b3/2). For the chaotic\n2\n\nkicked top, C0 = Jz (l)2 \u2212 Jz (l) \u2243 1/3. In addition, in\nstrong chaos regime, the parameter \u03b3 is very large which\nleads to coth(\u03b3/2) \u2243 1. Hence, the coefficient of the linear term of Eq. (7) is approximately equal to 1/6, which\nis very close to the value obtained for the parameter a,\ni.e., a \u2243 0.1776. Thus we show that the decoherence function of the chaotic kicked top has the properties which are\nsimilar to the properties of any other model of decohering\n\nFig. 3: (Color online) Evolution of the decoherence function\nf (n) of the kicked top. The dotted line is the exact numerics,\nand the solid line is the theoretical estimation. Inset is showing\nthe same in semi-logarithmic scale, where the time-axis is in\nlogarithmic scale.\n\nenvironment.\nIn conclusion, as a model of decohering environment, we\nestablish the equivalence between quantum chaotic system\nand any other many-body systems. This is an important\nresult, which suggests that instead of complex many-body\nsystem one can use a simple chaotic system as a model\nof environment. Consequently, analytical investigations\nof environment induced decoherence would be easier, and\nfrom numerical point of view as well, this simple model\nrequires very less computational resources. We substantiate our analytical formulation with strong numerical evidences. These show that quantum chaotic system is good\ndecoherer, and it can also create entanglement between\ntwo non-interacting particles. The later result is very important due to the recent identification of entanglement as\na resource for quantum computational and informational\nprotocols [2].\nWe thank Drs. A. Tanaka, D.
