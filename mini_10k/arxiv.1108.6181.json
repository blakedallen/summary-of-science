In this report\nwe discuss an effective model of charge ordered and (or)\nmagnetically ordered insulators.\nWe consider the following model Hamiltonian of\na fermion lattice system in the atomic limit\nX\nX\n\u0124 =\nU n\u0302i\u2191 n\u0302i\u2193 \u2212\n\u03bcn\u0302i +\n(1)\ni\n\n+\n\ni\n\nX\nW X\nn\u0302i n\u0302j \u2212 2J\n\u015dzi \u015dzj ,\n2\nhi,ji\n\nhi,ji\n\n\u0109+\ni\u03c3\n\nwhere\ndenotes the creation operator of an P\nelectron\nwith spin \u03c3 at the site i, n\u0302i\u03c3 = \u0109+\ni\u03c3 \u0109i\u03c3 , n\u0302i =\n\u03c3 n\u0302i\u03c3 ,\n\u015dzi = (1/2)(n\u0302i\u2191 \u2212 n\u0302i\u2193 ). U , W and J are the interaction\nparameters (on-site and intersite between the nearest\nneighbors). \u03bc is the chemical potential, depending on\nthe concentration of electrons\nP\nn = N1 i hn\u0302i i,\n(2)\nwith n \u2208 [0, 2], N is the total number of lattice\nP sites.\nOur denotations: nQ = 12 (nA \u2212 nB ), n\u03b1 = N2 i\u2208\u03b1 hn\u0302i i,\nP\nP\nm = N1 i h\u015dzi i, mQ = 12 (mA \u2212 mB ), m\u03b1 = N2 i\u2208\u03b1 h\u015dzi i,\nand \u03b1 = A, B labels the sublattices. W0 = zW and J0 =\nzJ, where z is the number of the nearest neighbors. Only\nthe two-sublattice orderings on the alternate lattices are\nconsidered in this report.\nThe interactions U , W , and J will be treated as effective ones and be assumed to include all the possible contributions and renormalizations.

Thus, we restrict ourselves to\nthe case J > 0.\nIn the analysis we have adopted a variational approach\n(VA), which treats the on-site interaction term (U ) exactly and the intersite interactions (W , J) within the\nmean-field approximation (MFA).\nFor the model (1) a ground state phase diagram as a\nfunction of \u03bc [4] (exact results) and special cases at T \u2265 0\n(in VA) such as W = 0 [5], J = 0 [6\u20138] and n = 1 [9] have\nbeen investigated till now.\nWithin the VA the intersite interactions are decoupled\nwithin the MFA, which allows us to find a free energy\nper site f (n). One can also calculate the averages: n,\nnQ , m and mQ , what gives a set of four self-consistent\nequations (for homogeneous phases). This set for T \u2265 0\nis solved numerically and one obtains nQ , m, mQ and\nn (or \u03bc) when \u03bc (or n) is fixed. It is important to find\na solution corresponding to the lowest energy.\nThe phase separation (PS) is a state in which two domains with different electron concentration exist (coexistence of two homogeneous phases). The energy of PS\nstates is given by\nfP S (n+ , n\u2212 ) = kf+ (n+ ) + (1 \u2212 k)f\u2212 (n\u2212 ),\n\n(3)\n\n\f2\n3\n\n(a )\n\nC O\n\n1 .2\n\nk B T /J\n\n0\n\nn = 0 .5\n2\n\nN O\nn = 0\n\n/J\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\nW\n\nN O\nF\n\n0 .4\n\n- 3 .0\n\n0 .0\n\n0 .5\n\n\u03bc /J\n3\n\nL C O\n2\n\nC O =\nP S 2\n\n1 .0\n\n1 .5\n\n2 .0\n\nI= P S 5\n= P S 6\n\nF\n\nP S 3\n\nP S 4\n\nP S 4\n\n- 1 .8\n\n- 1 .2\n\n- 0 .6\n\n0 .0\n\n0 .5\n\n1 .0\n\n1 .5\n\n2 .0\n\nn\n0\n\n0\n\nL C O\n\nI= P S 5\n= P S 6\n\nE\n\nFIG. 2.

A second (first) order transition is a transition\nbetween homogeneous phases with a (dis-)continuous\nchange of the order parameter at the transition temperature. A transition between homogeneous phase and PS\nstate is symbolically named as a \"third order\" transition. During this transition a size of one domain in the\nPS state decreases continuously to zero at the transition\ntemperature. We have also distinguished a second order\ntransition between two PS states, at which a continuous\nchange of the order parameter in both domains takes\nplace.\nIn this report we present the VA results for the model\n(1) in the limit U \u2192 +\u221e. This case corresponds to the\nsubspace excluding the double occupancy of sites (by\nelectrons for n < 1 or holes for n > 1). The obtained\nphase diagrams (for fixed n) are symmetric with respect\nto half-filling (n = 1) because of the particle\u2013hole symmetry of the Hamiltonian (1). The phases and states,\nwhich can exist on the phase diagrams of model considered, are collected in Table I.\n\nII.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION FOR U \u2192 +\u221e\n\nIn this section we discuss the behavior of the system in\nthe limit of infinite on-site interaction (U \u2192 +\u221e). The\nground state diagrams obtained in this limit are shown\nin Fig. 1. The energies of a few states are degenerated\nif the system is considered for fixed n. However, at finite temperatures the degeneration is removed. LCO is\nthe particular CO phase with nQ = 0.5 and n = 0.5 or\nn = 1.5.\nThe selected finite temperature phase diagrams, obtained for fixed \u03bc as well as for fixed n, are presented in\nFigs. 2\u20135. One should notice that the first order transitions on the diagrams for fixed \u03bc corresponds to the\n\"third order\" transitions and occurrence of PS sates on\nthe diagrams for fixed n. The second order transition\nF-NO occurs at kB T = J0 |1 \u2212 n| independently of W/J.\nThe labels of the critical points for phase separation are\ngiven corresponding to those in [10], where the BlumeEmery-Griffiths model was considered.

Finite temperature phase diagrams for W/J = 1.5\nand U \u2192 +\u221e. Denotations as in Fig. 2.\n\nFor large negative values of W/J, a second order F\u2013NO\nline terminates at E-point on a first order line, which itself ends at C-point (Fig. 2). For values of W/J ' 0\n(Fig. 3), the transition lines meet T -point, which is connected with a change of F\u2013NO transition order [5].\nWith increasing W/J the tricritical behavior changes\ninto another one with the C 0 -point located inside the F\nphase (cf. Fig. 4, for W/J = 0.5).\nFor W/J > 1 (Fig. 5) two new ordered phases appear on the phase diagrams: charge ordered (CO) phase\n(nQ 6= 0) and intermediate (I) homogeneous phase, where\nmagnetic order and charge order coexist (nQ 6= 0, m 6= 0\nand mQ 6= 0). If W/J = 1.5 the F and CO phases are\nseparated from the NO phase by two second order lines\nthat connect at B-point. The transitions between CO\n\n[1] R. Micnas, J. Ranninger, S. Robaszkiewicz, Rev.

Derived\nresults are exact in the limit of infinite dimensions, where\nthe MFA treatment of intersite interactions becomes the\nrigorous one.\nOur model in the limit U \u2192 +\u221e is equivalent to the\nBlume-Emery-Griffiths model, which is the general spin\nS = 1 Ising model with nearest-neighbor interactions and\nup-down symmetry. Thus obtained diagrams have the\nsimilar structure as those presented in Ref. 10.\nOne notice that in the U \u2192 \u2212\u221e limit of model (1) the\nmagnetic orderings are completely suppressed and the\nCO phase (for W > 0) or the PS: NO\u2013NO (for W < 0)\nstate can occur. For W = 0 only the NO is stable at any\nkB T \u2265 0 in this limit.\nLet us point out that in MFA the following equivalence\n\u0001\nP\nP\nMF A\n\u2212\n+ \u2212\noccurs: 2J hi,ji \u015dzi \u015dzj \u2190\u2192 J hi,ji \u015d+\ni \u015dj + \u015dj \u015di . In\nboth cases the self-consistent equations have the same\nform and a magnetization along the z-axis becomes a\nmagnetization in the xy-plane [11].\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nK.
