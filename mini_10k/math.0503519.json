This article is concerned with certain Markov processes\nwith state space {0, 1}V , where V is the vertex set of a graph, in which the\nevolution at each site of V is monotonic in time and the stochastic rate\nof evolution at a site is either a constant or zero, depending on the local\nconfiguration. Unusually for interacting particle systems, the focus is not\non equilibrium measures (owing to the irreversibility) but rather on exact\ncomputation or estimation of probabilities, in which more progress than\nusual can be made because of the simple form of the interactions.\nTwo of the processes which we consider are versions of random sequential\nadsorption (RSA), in which the graph represents an initially \"vacant\" surface onto which particles are deposited successively at random, subject to\nReceived February 2004; revised April 2004.\nSupported in part by the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences, Cambridge.\nAMS 2000 subject classifications.

SUDBURY\n\nan excluded volume effect whereby a deposited particle prevents new particles from being deposited nearby. We consider monomer RSA with nearestneighbor exclusion/blocking (or blocking RSA for short) and dimer RSA. We\nalso consider two forms of annihilation process in which sites are initially\nalive and from time to time kill their neighbors.\nInterest in RSA from the physical sciences community is considerable:\nsee the 1993 survey of Evans [7], and more recently, the series of surveys\nin Volume 165 (2000) of the journal Colloids and Surfaces A. The principal\nmotivation comes from the notion of particles being physically deposited\nonto a surface. Motivation is discussed further in [19], where qualitative\nresults are given for a class of process which generalizes those considered\nhere on the integer lattice. Continuum versions of RSA are also of interest\n(see, e.g., [18, 20]) but are not considered here. The annihilation process was\nintroduced by O'Hely and Sudbury in [14], as a model for the thinning of\nseedlings, where a plant can grow only by eliminating its neighbors.\nIn the present paper we consider general graphs (not only lattices). On\nthe qualitative side, we derive an existence result for these processes on\ninfinite graphs, forward equations governing the rate of change and a normal\napproximation theorem for the sum of the states of the vertices of a large\nfinite graph. On the quantitative side, we derive explicit formulae for the\noccupation probability of sites in regular infinite trees (Bethe lattices) and\nalso for correlations between sites in such trees. Moreover, we show that\nin the case of blocking RSA, these formulae provide good rigorous bounds\nfor occupation probabilities in lattices such as Zd , comparing favorably to\npreviously obtained rigorous bounds. The proof of these results for blocking\nRSA uses a result on positive correlations between sites an even distance\napart, which is of interest in its own right.\nA notable feature of these processes is that they can be interpreted in\na totally discrete manner. For finite graphs, they can be generated via a\nuniform probability measure on the possible orderings in which a finite collection of \"events\" associated with the vertices or edges of the graph can\noccur. For infinite graphs, they may be obtained by taking a limit of finite\ngraphs. Moreover, blocking RSA and the annihilation process on graphs provide a method of generating random independent sets of vertices, providing\nan alternative to the \"hard-core\" model which has received recent attention\nfrom discrete mathematicians [2, 9, 22].\n2. Definitions and main results.\n2.1. Definitions for finite graphs. Let V be the vertex set, and E the\nedge set, of a graph (we consider only graphs with no loops or multiple\nedges). We start by defining our models in the case where V is finite. Each\nof them is described as a continuous-time stochastic process (XtV , t \u2265 0)\n\n\fDEPOSITION PROCESSES ON GRAPHS\n\n3\n\ntaking values in {0, 1}V , with XtV (v) = 1 having the interpretation that site\nv \u2208 V is occupied at time t, and XtV (v) = 0 having the interpretation that v\nis vacant at time t. For each v, the evolution of (XtV (v), t \u2265 0) is monotonic,\nso that the value of XtV (v) changes at most once during the entire evolution\nof the process.\nBlocking RSA. Let the random variables (\u03c4v , v \u2208 V ) be independent and\nuniformly distributed on (0, 1), with \u03c4v representing the arrival time of a\nparticle at site v. All sites are initially vacant, and site v becomes occupied\nat time \u03c4v if and only if none of its neighbors is already occupied. If site v\nhas one or more occupied neighbors at time \u03c4v , the particle arriving at v is\nrejected (blocked) and there is no change to the state of the system at time\n\u03c4v (this is the nearest-neighbor blocking/exclusion effect). Once occupied, a\nsite remains permanently occupied.\nDimer RSA. Suppose (\u03c4e , e \u2208 E) are independent and uniform on (0, 1).\nHere \u03c4e represents the arrival time of a dimer at edge e. All sites are initially\nvacant.\nLet e = {u, v} \u2208 E be an edge of the graph, with endpoints u, v. If sites u\nand v are both vacant at time \u03c4e , then the dimer arriving at edge e at that\ntime is accepted and sites u, v both become occupied at that instant. If sites\nu, v are not both vacant at time \u03c4e , then the dimer arriving at e is rejected,\nand nothing changes at time \u03c4e . Once occupied, a site remains permanently\noccupied.\nThe annihilation process. Suppose (\u03c4e , e \u2208 E) are independent and uniform on (0, 1). Here \u03c4e represents the time of occurrence of an \"attack\" along\nthe edge e.\nIn this case each site is initially occupied. For each edge e = {u, v}, if sites\nu, v are both occupied immediately prior to time \u03c4e , then at time \u03c4e either\nsite u or site v (each with probability 1/2) becomes vacant (i.e., one site\n\"attacks\" the other). If u, v are not both occupied at time \u03c4e , then there is\nno change in the state of the system at that time. Once it becomes vacant,\na site remains vacant permanently.\nThe multiple annihilation process (MAP ). All sites are initially occupied, and (\u03c4v , v \u2208 V ) are independent and uniform on (0, 1). At time \u03c4v , site\nv (if still occupied) annihilates all of its neighbors and makes them all vacant, while remaining occupied itself. If v is already vacant at time \u03c4v there\nis no change to the state of the system at time \u03c4v .\nAlthough defined in terms of annihilations, the MAP is most closely related to the blocking RSA process. To demonstrate this relationship and\naid understanding of the MAP, we introduce a further process (ZtV , t \u2265 0)\n\n\f4\n\nM. D. PENROSE AND A. SUDBURY\n\nwith state-space {0, 1, 2}V , which we call the undecided site process (or USP\nfor short). Sites in states 0, 1, 2 are interpreted as vacant, occupied and\nundecided, respectively. In the USP, all sites are initially undecided (i.e., in\nstate 2). If site v is undecided immediately prior to time \u03c4v , then at that instant site v becomes occupied and all neighboring sites become (or remain)\nvacant. Otherwise, there is no change at time \u03c4v .\nWith the undecided site process ZtV defined in this way, for v \u2208 V define\ncoupled {0, 1}V -valued processes (XtV , t \u2265 0) and (YtV , t \u2265 0) by\n(1)\n\nXtV (v) = YtV (v) = ZtV (v)\n\nif ZtV (v) \u2208 {0, 1},\n\n(2)\n\nXtV (v) = 1 and YtV (v) = 0\n\nif ZtV (v) = 2.\n\nIn other words, undecided sites count as occupied for the process (XtV , t \u2265 0)\nand as vacant for the process (YtV , t \u2265 0). It is not hard to see that with\nthis construction, the process (XtV , t \u2265 0) is a realization of the MAP and\n(YtV , t \u2265 0) is a realization of the blocking RSA process. At the terminal\ntime 1, there are no undecided sites left and therefore the ultimate state of\neach site is the same for the coupled MAP and blocking RSA process, that\nis, X1V (v) = Y1V (v) for all v. In particular, the distribution at time 1 of the\nMAP and the blocking RSA process are identical. In view of this similarity,\nwe shall treat the MAP only briefly (in Section 4.4).\n2.2. Remarks. For each of the blocking RSA, dimer RSA and annihilation processes, the evolution of (XtV , t \u2265 0) is determined by the order\nof occurrence of the \"event times\" \u03c4v or \u03c4e (together with the directions\nof \"attacks\" in the case of the annihilation process). Since they are assumed independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), the \"events\" (arrivals\nof monomers, of dimers or attacks depending on the model) are equally\nlikely to occur in any possible order. If we took the event times to be i.i.d.\nwith some other nonuniform continuous distribution function F , then this\nwould still be the case. In other words, changing the distribution function F\namounts merely to a reparametrization of time. If the distribution F were\nchosen to be exponential, then the time-evolution of XtV = (XtV (v), v \u2208 V )\nwould be that of a time-homogeneous continuous-time Markov chain with\nstate-space {0, 1}V . However, in fact it turns out to be more convenient to\nassume instead that F is the uniform distribution on the unit interval (0, 1),\nin which case these processes run as non-time-homogeneous continuous-time\nMarkov chains.\nNote also that while we could allow events to occur repeatedly at the\nsame location (e.g., monomer arrivals at the times of a Poisson process for\neach site), in each model only the first \"event\" at any given location can\npossibly have any effect (e.g., if a monomer arriving at a particular site is\nblocked, then any later monomers arriving there are also blocked). Hence,\n\n\fDEPOSITION PROCESSES ON GRAPHS\n\n5\n\nonly the time of the first arrival is relevant, and as just mentioned, we can\njust as well (and do) take this to be uniformly rather than exponentially\ndistributed.\nOwing to the monotonicity of the evolution, each process ultimately reaches\na jammed state by time 1. For blocking (resp. dimer) RSA, jamming means\nthat no vertex (edge) is any longer available to accept incoming particles.\nFor annihilation, jamming means there is no pair of adjacent occupied sites.\nBoth blocking RSA and annihilation produce a random independent set (in\nthe graph-theoretic sense) of occupied sites at time 1; for blocking RSA\nthe set of occupied sites is independent at all times. Of interest are the joint\nprobability distributions of the states of sites at jamming, and also the states\nof sites at intermediate times prior to jamming.\n2.3. Extension to infinite graphs. Let us now consider our three main\nprocesses on a countably infinite graph. While it is not hard to envisage\nthat the preceding definitions of our monomer, dimer and annihilation processes should carry through to the case where V is countably infinite, we\nneed to check that these processes remain well defined. Evans ([7], page\n1302) appeals to general results from Liggett [11] to do this, but we prefer a\nmore direct approach, since the results in [11] are stated for interacting particle systems on Zd rather than general graphs, and for time-homogeneous\nMarkov processes rather than inhomogeneous ones, and in any case the direct approach is simpler here.\nA sufficient condition for our processes to be well defined on an infinite\ngraph is obtained by assuming that V has bounded degree.

Notation such as V , Vn or W strictly\nspeaking denotes the vertex set of a graph, but often will also be used to\ndenote the graph itself. We often have occasion to consider one graph embedded in another; when V \u2282 W and W is the vertex set of a graph, then\n(e.g., for RSA on V ) we assume the graph structure on V is that induced by\nthe graph structure on W . In other words, two elements of V are adjacent\n(in the graph V ) if and only if they are adjacent in the graph W .\nAnother way to define the process (XtV , t \u2265 0) on infinite graphs is by a\nrecursion which we illustrate only for the case of blocking RSA. If (\u03c4v , v \u2208 V )\nhas a local minimum at site w, then denote site w an accepted site and denote\nall neighbors of w as rejected sites. Remove all accepted and rejected sites\nfrom V and repeat. Continue indefinitely to generate a set of accepted sites.\nFor each site v, and t \u2265 0, set XtV (v) = 1 if and only if t \u2265 \u03c4v and site v is\naccepted; otherwise set XtV (v) = 0. It can be shown that if V is countable\nwith bounded degree, the process XtV generated this way is identical to\nthat given in Proposition 1. For a continuum blocking RSA model, a similar\napproach is used and described in more detail by Penrose ([18], page 160).\n2.4. Forward equations. Given a vertex set V of a graph, write dist(v, w)\nfor the graph distance between two elements of V . We introduce the notation\n(4)\n\nNk (v, V ) := {w \u2208 V : dist(v, w) \u2264 k},\n\nk > 0,\n\nfor neighborhoods of vertices in V , and write just Nk (v) for Nk (v, V ) if the\ngraph V is clear in the context.\nThe key to quantitative results is the fact that we can obtain differential\nequations for the probability of vacancy at particular sites. We first give\nsuch a result for blocking RSA.\nProposition 2. Let V be finite or countably infinite with bounded degree. Let W be a finite subset of V .

Summary of exact results for regular trees. Stochastic processes on\ntrees have been the subject of much activity in the probability community\nin the last 10\u201320 years. See, for example, [12, 17]. One reason for looking at\nsuch processes is that they are sometimes more tractable than the equivalent\nprocesses on lattices such as Zd , while providing some insight into the latter\nprocesses.\nIn Section 4 we consider our RSA and annihilation processes on the (k +\n1)-regular tree (Bethe lattice), which we denote by Tk . This is a countably\ninfinite connected graph in which each vertex has degree k + 1 (k \u2265 1 a fixed\ninteger). We shall give exact computations of probabilities on Tk which we\nsummarize as follows.\nFor an arbitrary vertex v of Tk , let \u03b1(t) denote the probability that vertex\nv is still in its initial state (vacant in the case of blocking or dimer RSA on\nTk , occupied in the case of annihilation on Tk ) at time t. Let \u03b2(t) be the\nprobability that v is still in its initial state at time t for these processes on\na graph obtained from Tk by removing one branch from v (in the case of\nblocking RSA) or by removing every branch except one from v (in the case of\ndimer RSA or the annihilation process). We shall use the forward equations\nfrom the preceding section to derive the following formulae for k \u2265 2 (only\nthe second line needs modification for k = 1):\nBlocking RSA\n\u03b2 \u2032 (t) = \u2212\u03b2(t)k\n\u03b2(t) = [1 + (k \u2212 1)t]\u22121/(k\u22121)\n\u03b1\u2032 (t) = \u2212\u03b2(t)k+1\n\u03b1(t) = 21 (1 + \u03b2(t)2 )\n\nDimer RSA\n\nAnnihilation\n\n\u03b2 \u2032 (t) = \u2212\u03b2(t)k\n\u03b2(t) = [1 + (k \u2212 1)t]\u22121/(k\u22121)\n\u03b1(t) = \u03b2(t)k+1\n\n\u03b2 \u2032 (t) = \u2212\u03b2(t)k /2\n\u03b2(t) = [1 + (k \u2212 1)t/2]\u22121/(k\u22121)\n\u03b1(t) = \u03b2(t)k+1\n\nyielding the following numerical values for the occupation probability P [XtTk (v) = 1]\nat time t = 1:\n\n\f9\n\nDEPOSITION PROCESSES ON GRAPHS\nOccupation probabilities at time t = 1 on Tk\nk\n\nBlocking\n\nDimer\n\nAnnihilation\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n10\n20\n\n0.432\n0.375\n0.333\n0.302\n0.276\n0.200\n0.135\n\n0.865\n0.875\n0.889\n0.901\n0.911\n0.940\n0.964\n\n0.368\n0.296\n0.250\n0.217\n0.192\n0.124\n0.074\n\nThe formulae above for \u03b1(t) have previously been seen in the literature,\nnot always in this form. In early work, Widom [23] gave an exact formula\nfor the occupation density for blocking RSA in T2 but later retracted this\n[24]. The correct formulae are given, at least for t = 1, by Evans ([5], page\n2529) for dimer RSA, by Fan and Percus ([8], equation (4.8), see also [6]) for\nblocking RSA and by O'Hely and Sudbury [14] for the annihilation process.\nHowever, the first two of these derivations are quite involved, and probabilists may find our derivation more appealing.\nWe shall also give exact formulae for the covariances between the states\nof different sites of Tk , for each model. The formulae are given in Section 4,\nand in this summary we just give some of the resulting numerical values of\ncorrelations between two sites at time t = 1. Clearly these depend only on\nthe graph distance between the two sites (and on k):\nCorrelations\nBlocking\nDistance\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\nDimer\n\nAnnihilation\n\nk=3\n\nk=5\n\nk=3\n\nk=5\n\nk=3\n\nk=5\n\n\u22120.5000\n0.1760\n\u22120.0474\n0.0103\n\u22120.0019\n\n\u22120.3820\n0.1003\n\u22120.0200\n0.0032\n\u22120.0004\n\n\u22120.1250\n0.0070\n0.0085\n\u22120.0041\n0.0012\n\n\u22120.0982\n0.0103\n0.0007\n\u22120.0005\n0.0001\n\n\u22120.3333\n0.0758\n\u22120.0130\n0.0018\n\u22120.0002\n\n\u22120.2383\n0.0407\n\u22120.0054\n0.0006\n\u22120.0001\n\nSee [16] for previous work on time-evolution of correlations for RSA on T1 .\nWe believe that our formulae for correlations in Tk , k \u2265 2, are new.\nWe note that the blocking and annihilation processes, but not the dimer\nprocess, show a pattern with sites at odd distances being negatively correlated and those at even distances being positively correlated. Next we\nnote that correlations fall off extremely fast, since they are truncations of\n\n\f10\n\nM. D. PENROSE AND A. SUDBURY\n\nthe exponential series (see Section 4). Also, correlations for the annihilation\nprocess are less than those for the blocking process. This is because for one\nsite to influence another, not only do the \"events\" along a path between\nthe two sites have to be in the correct temporal order, in the case of the\nannihilation process they have to be in the correct direction as well. Finally,\nthe correlations for k = 5 are smaller than those for k = 3.\n2.6. Bounds for bipartite graphs. A graph is bipartite if its vertex set can\nbe partitioned into two independent (in the graph-theoretic sense) subsets.\nThe next result says that for either RSA or the annihilation process, on a\nbipartite graph, the states of sites an even graph distance apart are positively\ncorrelated and the states of sites an odd graph distance apart are negatively\ncorrelated. This shows, among other things, that the pattern of positive and\nnegative covariances for blocking RSA or the annihilation process, seen in\nthe table from Section 2.5, extends to all k and all distances (since any tree\nis bipartite).\nTheorem 5. Suppose V is the vertex set of a bipartite graph. For j =\n0, 1, . . . , k, suppose Wj \u2286 V , with vj \u2208 Wj and tj \u2208 [0, 1], and define the event\nEj by\nW\n\nif dist(vj , v0 ) is even,\n\nW\n\nif dist(vj , v0 ) is odd.\n\nEj := {Xtj j (vj ) = 0}\nEj := {Xtj j (vj ) = 1}\n\nThen for either blocking RSA or the annihilation process,\n(11)\n\nP\n\n\"\n\nk\n\\\n\nj=0\n\n#\n\nEj \u2265 P [E0 ]P\n\n\"\n\nk\n\\\n\nj=1\n\n#\n\nEj .\nW\n\nIn Theorem 5, it is to be understood that the processes (Xt j, t \u2265 0) are\ndefined for all j in terms of the same set of random arrival times (\u03c4v , v \u2208\nV ) (in the case of RSA) and the same set of random arrival times \u03c4e and\nrandom directions of attacks, along each edge (in the case of the annihilation\nprocess). The main case of interest in Theorem 5 is when Wj = V for each\nj, but we shall also use the result in the more general form given.\nLet us say V is a bipartite lattice if (i) V is the vertex set of a bipartite\ngraph and (ii) for any v1 , v2 , w1 , w2 \u2208 V with v1 adjacent to v2 and w1 adjacent to w2 , there exists a graph isomorphism from V to itself which sends vi\nto wi , i = 1, 2. Examples include the integer lattice Zd (with edges between\neach pair of vertices a unit Euclidean distance apart), and also the hexagonal lattice (but not the triangular lattice which is not bipartite). Various\nfinite graphs are also bipartite lattices, including any lattice torus and also\nthe discrete n-cube.\n\n\f11\n\nDEPOSITION PROCESSES ON GRAPHS\n\nFor a bipartite lattice, every vertex has the same degree. One of our main\nresults says that for blocking RSA on such a lattice, the exact values given\nin the table for vacancy probabilities in the corresponding tree with the\nsame vertex degrees, provide upper bounds for vacancy probabilities for the\nbipartite lattice.\nTheorem 6.

Simulations suggest a value of approximately\n0.364 ([7], page 1292).\nIn the case of the hexagonal lattice, we have k = 2 so that by Theorem\n6, P [X1V (v) = 1] \u2265 3/8, which compares favorably to the lower bound of\n0.3596 provided (with a good deal of effort) by Caser and Hilhorst in [3].\nSimulations indicate a value of 0.379 [6, 7, 23].\nFor the integer lattices Z3 and Z4 we have k = 5 and k = 7, respectively,\nso that Theorem 6 yields lower bounds for P [X1V (v) = 1] of 0.2764 and\n0.2386, respectively, compared to simulated values [7, 13] of 0.304 and 0.264,\nrespectively.\nRemark. Our attempts to obtain good rigorous bounds for the annihilation process on bipartite lattices, using a similar argument to the proof of\nTheorem 6, have not been so successful. See the remarks at the end of the\nproof of Theorem 6.\n2.7. Results on normal approximation.

For example, Wn could be the same as Vn for each\nn, or all Wn could be the same infinite vertex set W , containing all the Vn .\nUnder these circumstances, Theorem 7 gives us a central limit theorem with\nerror bound on the rate of convergence, provided the Wn have uniformly\nbounded degrees and we have reasonably fast growth of Var(St (Vn , Wn )).\nIt can be shown that Var(St (Vn , Wn )) = O(card(Vn )), and one might expect Var(St (Vn , Wn )) = \u0398(card(Vn )) which would be sufficient to guarantee\na central limit theorem from (13) with a rate of convergence card(Vn )\u03b5\u22121/2 .\nThe next result guarantees that this is indeed the case for t < 1.\nTheorem 8.

These are\nillustrated by Figure 2 and described below.\nFor the first example, suppose V0 is an arbitrary finite graph, and V is\nobtained by starting with V0 and adding a \"twin\" vertex for each vertex in\n\nFig. 2.\nance.\n\nTwo graphs for which the ultimate number of particles deposited has zero vari-\n\n\fDEPOSITION PROCESSES ON GRAPHS\n\n13\n\nV0 , with each added vertex connected by an edge only to its twin. Ultimately,\nfor each pair of twinned sites exactly one of the twins will be occupied, so that\nthe variance of S1 (V, V ) is zero, for either blocking RSA or the annihilation\nprocess, although V can be arbitrarily large.\nFor a second example, suppose V0 is an arbitrary finite graph, and V is\nobtained by starting with V0 and adding for each vertex v \u2208 V0 a pair of\nextra vertices v \u2032 , v \u2032\u2032 , with v \u2032 connected by edges only to v \u2032\u2032 and to v, and v \u2032\u2032\nconnected only to v and to v \u2032 . In other words, a triangle is appended to each\nvertex in the original graph V0 , and again we conclude that the variance of\nS1 (V, V ) is zero for either blocking RSA or the annihilation process.\nThe first counterexample suggests that we may be in difficulties trying\nto find lower bounds for Var(S1 (V, V )) if all of V lies near to the boundary\n(i.e., to the set of vertices of degree 1) while the second suggests that there\ncan be problems if V is not bipartite.\nTo give a sufficient condition for (14) to hold even for t = 1, we introduce\nfurther terminology. Let us say that a site v in a graph W has positive entropy\nif (i) there exist at least two sites in W that are adjacent to v but not to each\nother and (ii) there exists an independent subset Bv of N3 (v, W ) \\ N2 (v, W )\nsuch that every vertex in N2 (v, W ) has at least one neighbor in Bv . We shall\nlater call Bv a blocking set for v.\nA sufficient condition for v to have positive entropy is that W be the\nvertex set of a bipartite graph and v be a graph distance at least 3 from the\nboundary of W [one can then take Bv = N3 (v, W ) \\ N2 (v, W )].\nDenote the set of sites in W with positive entropy by W + .\nTheorem 9.

However, Theorem\n10 addresses processes on general graphs whereas [19] restricts attention to\ncertain graphs embedded in Zd . Also, the proof of Theorem 10 provides a\nbound on the rate of convergence, unlike the corresponding proof in [19].

Proof of existence results and forward equations.\nTerminology. By a path of vertices in a graph we mean a sequence of\ndistinct vertices such that any two consecutive vertices in the sequence are\nconnected by an edge. By a path of edges, we mean a sequence of distinct\nedges such that any two consecutive edges in the sequence have an endpoint\nin common.\nProof of Proposition 1. (i) Suppose W \u2282 W \u2032 \u2282 V , with W and W \u2032\n\u2032\nboth finite. Then for v \u2208 W , it is the case that XtW (v) = XtW (v) unless\nthere is a path of vertices v0 , v1 , . . . , vm , starting at v0 = v and ending at\nsome vertex vm \u2208 W \u2032 \\ W , such that \u03c4v1 > \u03c4v2 > * * * > \u03c4vm , since the only\nway that the effect of a vertex in W \u2032 \\ W can propagate to v is along such\na path in reverse order.\nTherefore, for infinite V , a sufficient condition for the existence of the\nlimit (3) for v \u2208 V is the existence of a finite random variable R(v) such\nthat there is no path (v0 , v1 , . . . , vm ) in V with v0 = v, m > R(v), and with\n\u03c4v0 > \u03c4v1 > * * * > \u03c4vm , since in that case, the value of XtW (v) will be the same\nfor all finite W \u2282 V containing all vertices within graph distance R(v) of v.\nLet v \u2208 V . Since degrees are assumed bounded by a constant which we\ndenote D, the number of distinct self-avoiding paths starting at v of length\nm is bounded by D m . For any such undirected path (v0 , v1 , . . . , vm ), we have\nP [\u03c4v0 > \u03c4v1 > * * * > \u03c4vm ] = 1/(m + 1)!\nsince any ordering of the times \u03c4vj , 0 \u2264 j \u2264 m, is equally likely. Hence, the\nprobability that there is a path of length m starting from v with associated\narrival times in decreasing order is bounded by D m /(m + 1)!, and by the\nBorel\u2013Cantelli lemma, the total number of paths starting from v with associated arrival times in decreasing order is almost surely finite; we can take\nR(v) to be the maximum of the lengths of such paths. This goes for any\nv \u2208 V , and the existence of the limit in (3) for all v, t follows.\n(ii) Given W \u2282 W \u2032 \u2282 V , with W and W \u2032 finite, and given v \u2208 W , it is the\n\u2032\ncase that the value of XtW (v) = XtW (v) for dimer RSA, unless there exists\na path of edges e1 , e2 , . . . , em that starts at v and ends at some vertex in\nW \u2032 \\ W , such that \u03c4e1 > \u03c4e2 > * * * > \u03c4em .\nWe assert that there exists almost surely a random variable R\u2032 (v) such\nthat there is no path of length greater than R\u2032 (v), starting at v, with all\nedge arrival times along the path in decreasing order. The proof of this is\nthe same as for the corresponding assertion in the proof of part (i).\nThen XtW (v) will be the same for all finite W \u2286 V with W containing\nall vertices a graph distance at most R\u2032 (v) from v. Hence, (3) holds for the\ndimer process.\n\n\f16\n\nM. D. PENROSE AND A. SUDBURY\n\nNext consider the annihilation process. With v, W, W \u2032 as before, this time\n\u2032\nwe have XtW (v) = XtW (v) unless there exists a path of edges e1 , e2 , . . . , em\nthat starts at v and ends at some vertex in W \u2032 \\ W , such that \u03c4e1 > \u03c4e2 >\n* * * > \u03c4em and in addition all \"attacks\" along the edges are in the direction of\nthe path towards v. Hence with R\u2032 (v) as defined for dimers, the annihilation\nprocess XtW (v) will be the same for all finite W \u2286 V with W containing\nall vertices a graph distance at most R\u2032 (v) from v.

Let W be a finite subset of V . There is an\ne W (see\nobvious canonical bijection between the edges of G and the edges of G\nFigure 1), and using this bijection, for either the dimer RSA or annihilation\nprocess there is a coupling between a realization of the process (XtV , t \u2265 0)\ne\n\nand the process (XtVW , t \u2265 0) where we take the arrival time \u03c4e to be the\ne W (and in the\nsame for edge e of G and for the corresponding edge of G\nannihilation model, we take the direction of attacks to be the same in both\nprocesses).\nWith this coupling, the state of each vertex v \u2208 V for the process XtV is\nthe same as the state of the corresponding vertex or vertices in VeW for the\n\n\f18\n\nM.

This is\ntrue for both dimer RSA and the annihilation process, so that (9) and (10)\nhold. \u0003\n4. Analysis of the k-tree.

Proof of bounds for bipartite graphs.\nProof of Theorem 5. First we consider the blocking RSA process.\nDefine the independent U (0, 1) variables Uv , v \u2208 V , by\nUv =\n\n(\n\n\u03c4v ,\n\nif dist(v, v0 ) is even,\n\n1 \u2212 \u03c4v ,\n\nif dist(v, v0 ) is odd.\n\nWe assert that for j = 0, 1, . . . , k, the indicator of the event Ej , defined by\nW\nW\nEj := {Xtj j (vj ) = 0} if dist(v0 , vj ) is even, and by Ej := {Xtj j (vj ) = 1} if\ndist(v0 , vj ) is odd, is an increasing function of the variables Uv , v \u2208 V . To\nsee this choose any v \u2208 V , let 0 \u2264 u < u\u2032 \u2264 1 and fix numbers uw \u2208 [0, 1] for\nw \u2208 V \\ {v}. We assert that if\n(64)\n\n{Uv = u} \u2229\n\n\\\n\n{Uw = uw }\n\nimplies Ej occurs,\n\n\\\n\n{Uw = uw }\n\nimplies Ej occurs.\n\nw\u2208V \\{v}\n\nthen\n(65)\n\n{Uv = u\u2032 } \u2229\n\nw\u2208V \\{v}\n\nTo see this, first suppose dist(v, v0 ) is even. Consider the effect of increasing\nthe value of Uv (and hence of \u03c4v ) from u to u\u2032 while leaving the values of\nW\nUw , w \u2208 V \\ {v}, unchanged. This can change the value of Xt j (v), if at all,\nby changing it from 1 to 0. It can also directly affect sites w neighboring v,\nW\nif at all, by changing Xt j (w) from 0 to 1. These sites, in turn, can affect\nW\nsome of the sites w at a distance 2 from v by changing Xt j (w) from 1 to 0.\nIn general, for any w, t, the effect of changing Uv from u to u\u2032 on the value\nW\nof Xt j (w), if any, can only be to decrease it if dist(v, w) is even and can\nonly be to increase it if dist(v, w) is odd. The assertion that (64) implies\n(65) follows.\nThe argument is similar when dist(v, v0 ) is odd. In this case, increasing\nthe value of Uv is equivalent to decreasing the value of \u03c4v , and this can only\nW\nincrease the value of Xt j (w) when dist(v, w) is even and can only decrease\nW\nthe value of Xt j (w) when dist(v, w) is odd. Since dist(v, w) is even if and\nonly if dist(v0 , w) is odd, we may conclude once again that (64) implies (65).\nThis justifies our initial assertion that the indicator of event Ej is increasing\nin the variables Uv , for each j.\nThe result (11) for the blocking process now follows from the Harris\u2013FKG\ninequality. The usual version of this result (see, e.g., [10]) gives positive correlations of events which are increasing in a family of {0, 1}-valued variables,\n\n\f28\n\nM. D. PENROSE AND A. SUDBURY\n\nbut the proof in [10] is easily adapted to the present case with [0, 1]-valued\nvariables Uj .\nNow consider the annihilation process. We first consider a modified version of this process, whereby for any pair of neighboring sites u, v there is\na random time tuv uniform on [0, 1] at which u annihilates v (if both sites\nwere still occupied immediately before time tuv ). It is clear that only the\nevent at the minimum of tuv , tvu can be effective. Therefore, this modified\nannihilation process is equivalent to the one we originally defined, except\nthat for each edge the time \u03c4e is distributed as the minimum of two independent uniform variables on (0, 1), rather than as a uniform variable on\n(0, 1). However, this, in turn, is equivalent to a time-change of the original\nannihilation process, as explained in Section 2.2, and therefore it suffices to\nprove the result for this modified annihilation process.\nLet the uniform random variables Uu,v be defined for each pair of neighboring sites u, v, by\nUuv =\n\n(\n\ntuv ,\n\nif dist(u, v0 ) is even,\n\n1 \u2212 tuv ,\n\nif dist(u, v0 ) is odd.\n\nBy the same argument as for blocking RSA, for each j the indicator of event\nEj is an increasing function of the variables Uuv , and the proof of (11) for\nblocking RSA carries through to the annihilation process. \u0003\nProof of Theorem 6. Suppose V is a bipartite lattice and each vertex\nhas degree k + 1. Let v0 be some arbitrary specified vertex of V , let the\nneighbors of v0 be denoted v1 , . . . , vk+1 and let the neighbors of v1 (other\nthan v0 ) be denoted w1 , . . . , wk .

(n + 1 \u2212 i)!\n\nSince |\u2206ni | \u2264 1, we have\n| Cov(\u2206ni , \u2206nj )| \u2264 E|\u2206ni \u2206nj | + E|\u2206ni |E|\u2206nj | \u2264 2 min(P [\u2206ni 6= 0], P [\u2206nj 6= 0]).\nHence Var\nVar\n\nPn\n\nn\ni=1 \u2206i\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\n\u2206ni\n\n=\n\n= O(1) since\nn X\nn\nX\n\nCov(\u2206ni , \u2206nj )\n\ni=1 j=1\n\n\u22642\n\nn X\nn\nX\n\n\u0012\n\nmin\n\ni=1 j=1\n\n\u2308n/2\u2309 \u2308n/2\u2309\n\n\u22648\n\nX X\n\nj=1\n\ni=1\n\n\u2264 32\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n+\n, +\ni!

Similarly (20), if true, implies (19).\nDefine Cov(m, t) := Cov(m, t, T1 ) as given by (27), with Cov(0, t) = Var XtZ (0).\nThen by translation invariance,\nn\u22121 Var(St (Ln , Z)) = n\u22121\n\nn X\nn\nX\n\ni=1 j=1\n\nCov(|i \u2212 j|, t)\n\n\f36\n\nM.
