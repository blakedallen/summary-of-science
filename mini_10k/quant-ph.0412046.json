In particular it is conjectured that the\noutput state with maximal p-norm from a product channel is always a\nproduct state. It is shown here that the Lieb-Thirring inequality can be\nused to prove this conjecture for one special case, namely when one of the\ncomponents of the product channel is of the type known as a diagonal\nchannel.\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe minimal output entropy of a quantum channel \u03a6 is defined by\nSmin(\u03a6) = inf S(\u03a6(\u03c1))\n\u03c1\n\n(1)\n\nwhere S is the von Neumann entropy, and the inf runs over states in the domain\nof \u03a6. The following additivity property is conjectured.\nConjecture 1 Let \u03a6 and \u03a8 be any quantum channels, that is completely positive, trace-preserving maps on finite-dimensional matrix algebras. Then\nSmin (\u03a6 \u2297 \u03a8) = Smin (\u03a6) + Smin(\u03a8)\n\n(2)\n\nWithin the last year, Shor [11] proved that Conjecture 1 is equivalent to\nseveral other outstanding conjectures in quantum information theory, among\nthem additivity of Holevo capacity of a quantum channel, and additivity of the\nentanglement of formation. Thus a proof of Conjecture 1 would settle quite a\nfew outstanding problems in the field.\nThe additivity conjecture has been proved for several special classes of channels [10], [6], [7]. The Lieb-Thirring inequality [9] was a key ingredient in several\nof those proofs. The purpose of this paper is to show how the Lieb-Thirring inequality can be used to demonstrate (2) for another class known as the 'diagonal'\nchannels.\nThe problem is attacked by making use of the maximal output p-norm for\np \u2265 1, also called the maximal output purity of a channel [1], which is defined\nby\n\u0010 \u0010\n\u0011p \u00111/p\n\u03bdp (\u03a6) = sup ||\u03a6(\u03c1)||p = sup Tr \u03a6(\u03c1)\n\u03c1\n\n(3)\n\n\u03c1\n\nThe derivative of \u03bdp (\u03a6) at p = 1 is the negative minimal output entropy, so\nConjecture 1 is a consequence of the following stronger conjecture.\nConjecture 2 There is some p0 > 1, such that for all quantum channels \u03a6 and\n\u03a8, and all 1 \u2264 p \u2264 p0 ,\n\u03bdp (\u03a6 \u2297 \u03a8) = \u03bdp (\u03a6) \u03bdp (\u03a8)\n2\n\n(4)\n\n\fIn this paper we consider a class of channels known as the 'diagonal' channels,\nand show how the Lieb-Thirring inequality can be used to derive (4) under the\nassumption that at least one of the channels \u03a6 or \u03a8 is in this class. It turns out\nthat the multiplicativity result for diagonal channels holds for all p \u2265 1, so this\nmight lead one to hope that p0 = \u221e in Conjecture 2. However it is known that\nmultiplicativity fails in general for p \u2265 5 [12], and indeed this probably provides\nevidence that the strategy used in this paper cannot be directly extended to\nprove Conjecture 2 in the general case. Nevertheless it seems worthwhile to\nexplain the approach used, as the techniques may be useful for other reasons,\nand the results may have other applications in quantum information theory.\nThe method of proof is quite similar to the approach used by the author to\nprove Conjecture 2 for the class of entanglement-breaking channels [5].\n\n2\n\nStatement of results\n\nSince we will be concerned with p-norms from now on, the trace-preserving\ncondition for quantum channels is unimportant, and so we deal instead with\ncompletely positive maps. The diagonal class of channels was described by\nLandau and Streater [8]. Recall that the Hadamard product of two n \u00d7 n\nmatrices A and B is defined by\n(A \u2217 B)ij = Aij Bij\n\n(5)\n\nDefinition 3 The CP map \u03a6 is called diagonal if there is a positive semidefinite\nmatrix C such that\n\u03a6(\u03c1) = C \u2217 \u03c1\n\n(6)\n\nIf C = |\u03c8ih\u03c8| is rank one, then (6) can be written\nC \u2217 \u03c1 = Diag(\u03c8) \u03c1 Diag(\u03c8)\u2217\n\n(7)\n\nwhere Diag(\u03c8) is the diagonal n \u00d7 n matrix with the components of |\u03c8i along\nthe diagonal. Using the spectral representation it follows that a map is diagonal\nif and only if it has a Kraus representation with all diagonal matrices.\nOur main result is stated below in Theorem 4.\n\n3\n\n\fTheorem 4 Let \u03a6 be a diagonal map, and let \u03a8 be any other CP map. Then\nfor all p \u2265 1,\n\u03bdp (\u03a6 \u2297 \u03a8) = \u03bdp (\u03a6) \u03bdp (\u03a8)\n\n(8)\n\nThe main tool used in the proof is the Lieb-Thirring inequality [9], which\nwe now state. Let K \u2265 0 be a positive semidefinite n \u00d7 n matrix, and let V be\nany k \u00d7 n matrix. Then for all p \u2265 1,\n\u0011p\n\u0010\nTr V KV \u2217 \u2264 Tr(V \u2217 V )p/2 K p (V \u2217 V )p/2 = Tr(V \u2217 V )p K p\n(9)\nThere are several proofs of this inequality [9], [2]. The original proof of Lieb\nand Thirring employs Epstein's concavity theorem [3], which is based on a combination of spectral theory and analytic continuation methods.\n\n3\n\nThe factorization\n\nThe goal of this section is to rewrite the output of the product channel \u03a6 \u2297 \u03a8\nin the factorized form V KV \u2217 so that (9) can be applied. We assume that \u03a6 is a\ndiagonal channel which acts by Hadamard product with the n\u00d7n matrix C. Let\n\u03c1 be a state on Ckn , that is a positive semidefinite kn \u00d7 kn matrix with trace 1,\nfor some k \u2265 1. Then \u03c1 can be written as a n \u00d7 n block matrix where the blocks\n(\u03c1) ij are k \u00d7 k matrices. The diagonal blocks (\u03c1) ii are positive semidefinite, and\nwe define\n\u03b1i = Tr(\u03c1) ii\n\n(10)\n\nDefine a new kn \u00d7 kn matrix \u03c4 with blocks\n(\u03c4 ) ij = (\u03b1i \u03b1j )\u22121/2 (\u03c1) ij\n\n(11)\n\nand let A denote the n \u00d7 n matrix with entries Aij = (\u03b1i \u03b1j )1/2 . Then \u03c1 can be\nwritten as a Hadamard product of A with \u03c4 , that is\n\u03c1 = (A \u2297 Jk ) \u2217 \u03c4\nwhere Jk is the k \u00d7 k matrix with all entries equal to 1:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n1 ... 1\n.\n.. \uf8f8\nJk = \uf8ed ..\n.\n1 ... 1\n4\n\n(12)\n\n(13)\n\n\fNotice that Jk acts as the identity for the Hadamard product. Furthermore this\ndecomposition commutes with the action of \u03a8 on the second factor, that is\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(I \u2297 \u03a8)(\u03c1) = (A \u2297 Jk ) \u2217 (I \u2297 \u03a8)(\u03c4 )\n(14)\nThe map \u03a6 \u2297 I acts on (14) by a Hadamard product with the matrix C on the\nfirst factor. This Hadamard product acts just on the matrix A, and the result\nis\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u0010\n\u0011\n(\u03a6 \u2297 \u03a8)(\u03c1) = \u03a6(A) \u2297 Jk \u2217 (I \u2297 \u03a8)(\u03c4 )\n(15)\nThe next step is to factorize the matrix (I \u2297 \u03a8)(\u03c4 ). To do this, let V1 , . . . , Vn\nbe the k \u00d7 kn matrices which are the block-rows of its square root, that is\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\nV1\n\u0010\n\u00111/2\n.\n(I \u2297 \u03a8)(\u03c4 )\n= \uf8ed .. \uf8f8\n(16)\nVn\nThen it follows that\n\uf8f6\nV1\n.\n(I \u2297 \u03a8)(\u03c4 ) = \uf8ed .. \uf8f8 ( V1\u2217\nVn\n\uf8eb\n\nV1 V1\u2217\n. . .

Vn Vn\u2217\n\n(17)\n\nNotice that the diagonal terms are \u03a8((\u03c4 ) ii ) = Vi Vi\u2217 , and since (\u03c4 ) ii is positive\nsemidefinite with Tr(\u03c4 ) ii = 1 it follows that\n||Vi Vi\u2217 ||p \u2264 \u03bdp (\u03a8)\nApplying the factorization (17) to (15)\n\uf8eb\n\u03a6(A) 11 V1 V1\u2217\n..\n(\u03a6 \u2297 \u03a8)(\u03c1) = \uf8ed\n.\n\u03a6(A) n1 Vn V1\u2217\n\n(18)\n\ngives\n\uf8f6\n. . . \u03a6(A) 1n V1 Vn\u2217\n..\n..\n\uf8f8\n.\n.\n. . . \u03a6(A) nn Vn Vn\u2217\n\n(19)\n\nNow the right side of (19) can be rewritten as a product of three matrices:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6 V1\u2217 0 . . . 0\nV1 0 . . . 0\n\u03a6(A) 11 I \u2032 . . . \u03a6(A) 1n I \u2032\n\uf8ec 0 V2\u2217 . . . 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0 V2 . . . 0 \uf8f7\n..\n..\n\uf8ec .\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec .\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n.\n. \uf8f7(20)\n..\n.\n.\n..\n\uf8ed ..\n\uf8ed ..\n. .. \uf8f8\n. .. \uf8f8\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03a6(A) n1 I . . . \u03a6(A) nn I\n0 0 . . .
