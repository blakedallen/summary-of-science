Introduction\nThe main achievement in theoretical physics the past few years is the realization that all five string theories [1] are related amongst themselves and that\nare limits of a another theory which has been called M-theory [2, 3]. The precise nature of M-theory remains a mystery but by now an impressive amount of\nevidence has been gather which point to its existence. Most of these arise from\ninvestigating the low energy approximation of strings and M-theory which are described by ten- and eleven-dimensional supergravities, respectively; see however\n[4]. The use of supergravity theories in this context is two-fold. First, the conjectured duality symmetries of string theories are discrete subgroups of the continuous\nduality symmetries of the field equations of supergravity theories [5]. Second, the\nsupergravity theories admit solutions which have the interpretation of extended\nobjects embedded in the spacetime, called branes, which are the BPS solitons of\nstrings and M-theory. A consequence of their BPS property is that branes are\nstable under deformations of the various parameters of the theories, like for example coupling constants. Because of this, they can be used to compare the various\nlimits of M-theory and thus establish the relations amongst the various string theories. Extrapolating from the properties of eleven-dimensional and ten-dimensional\nsupergravities, M-theory is thought to have the following essential ingredients:\n\u2022 A low energy description in terms of the eleven-dimensional supergravity,\n\u2022 M-2- and M-5-branes, and\n\u2022 limits that describe all five string theories in ten dimensions.\nThe solutions of supergravity theories with a brane interpretation have some\ncommon properties. The associate spacetime of a p-brane has an asymptotic region isometric to R(1,p) \u00d7 Rn , where, viewing the p-brane as a (p+1)-dimensional\nsubmanifold of spacetime, R(1,p) and Rn are identified with the worldvolume and\ntransverse directions of the p-brane, respectively; (p + n) is equal either to nine\n(string theory) or to ten (M-theory). In the above asymptotic region a mass m\n2\n\n\fand a charge q per unit Rp \u2282 R(1,p) volume is defined, i.e m and q are energy and\ncharge densities, respectively. Then using the properties of supergravity theory, a\nbound can be established [6] as\nm \u2265 \u03b1 |q| ,\nwhere for string theory branes \u03b1 depends on the string coupling constant \u03bb. The\nprecise dependence of \u03b1 distinguishes between the various types of branes as follows: \u03b1 \u223c \u03bb0 for fundamental strings, \u03b1 \u223c \u03bb\u22121 for Dirichlet branes or D-branes\nfor short and \u03b1 \u223c \u03bb\u22122 for Neveu-Schwarz 5-branes or NS-5-branes for short. The\nsolutions that are of interest are those that saturate the above bound leading to\nBPS type configurations. BPS configurations are associated with parallel spinors\nwith respect to a connection which occurs naturally in supergravity theories. The\nBPS branes of strings and M-theory admit sixteen parallel spinors. Apart from\nthe stability of these BPS solutions that has already been mentioned above, superposition rules have been found that allow to combine two or more such solutions\nand construct new ones [7]. The solutions that arise from superpositions of BPS\nbranes also admit parallel spinors which typically are less than those of the branes\ninvolved in the superposition.\nIn this paper, the geometry of a class of BPS brane solutions of supergravity\ntheories and that of their superpositions will be described. I shall begin with a\ndescription of BPS M-2-brane [8] and M-5-brane [9] solutions of eleven-dimensional\nsupergravity [10]. Then I shall explain the connection between BPS solutions and\nparallel spinors. I shall continue with the NS-5-brane solution of type II tendimensional supergravity theories [11] and show that the geometry of this solution\nis hyper-K\u00e4hler with torsion (HKT). Then I shall explore the various superpositions\nof NS-5-branes and I shall demonstrate that these superpositions are related to\nthe quaternionic calibrations in R8 [12]. I shall interpret these superpositions as\nintersecting NS-5-branes and I shall show that the geometry of these solutions is\nagain HKT. Most of these results have appeared in [13, 14]. Finally, I shall state\nmy conclusions.\n3\n\n\f2. Eleven-Dimensional Supergravity\nI shall not attempt to give a full description of eleven-dimensional supergravity.\nThis can be found in the original paper of Cremmer, Julia and Scherk who constructed the theory [10]. Here I shall only emphasize some aspects of the geometric\nstructure of the theory. In field theoretic terms, the theory describes the dynamics\nof the graviton g, a three-form gauge potential A and a gravitino \u03c8. The latter is a\nspinor-valued one-form which does not enter in the analysis below and so it will be\nneglected in what follows. Geometrically, let (N; g, F, \u2207) be an eleven-dimensional\nspin manifold N of signature (\u2212, +, . . . , +) equipped with a metric g, a closed\nfour-form F , locally F = dA, and a connection \u2207. In the physics literature \u2207 is\ncalled superconnection and\nC \u221e (S) \u2192 \u03a91 (N) \u2297 C \u221e (S) ,\n\n\u2207 :\n\nwhere S is the spin bundle over N and rank (S) = 32. This connection can be\nwritten as\n\u2207 = D + T (F ) ,\nD is the connection of S induced from the Levi-Civita connection of the metric g\nand\nTM (F )dxM = \u2212\n\n\u0001\n1\nFN P QR \u0393M N P QR \u2212 8\u03b4 N M \u0393P QR dxM ,\n144\n\nwhere {\u0393M ; M = 0, . . . , 10} is a basis in the Clifford algebra Clif(1, 10) and\n\u0393M1 M2 ***Mn = \u0393[M1 \u0393M2 * * * \u0393Mn ] . The dynamics of the theory is described\n\n\u22c6\n\nby\n\nthe action\nS=\n\nZ\n\nd11 x\n\np\n\u0001 4\n|det g| R(g) \u2212 2|F |2 \u2212 A \u2227 F \u2227 F ,\n3\n\nwhere R(g) is the Ricci scalar of the metric g and the norm of F is taken with respect to g. The above action consists from the Einstein-Hilbert term, the standard\n1\n1\n\u03c9a1 ,...,ap dxa1 \u2227. . .\u2227dxap , |\u03c9|2 = p!\n\u03c9a1 ,...,ap \u03c9 a1 ,...,ap\n\u22c6 The conventions for forms are as follows: \u03c9 = p!\n\u2217\u2217\np(n\u2212p)\n\u2217\nand \u03c9 = \u2212(\u22121)\n\u03c9, where is the Hodge star operation and n = 11 in the present\ncase.\n\n4\n\n\fkinetic term for F and a Chern-Simons term, respectively. The equations of the\nfields g and A can be derived by varying the above action.\nThere are two classes of solutions to the field equations depending on whether\nor not F = 0. If F = 0, then the field equations imply that the Ricci tensor\nof g vanishes. Therefore a large class of solutions is R(1,10\u2212n) \u00d7 M n , where M n\nis a manifold of appropriate special holonomy, i.e SU(k), k = 2, 3, 4 (n = 2k);\nSp(2) (n = 8); G2 (n = 7); Spin(7) (n = 8). Such solutions admit parallel spinors\nand have found application in the various compactifications of M-theory [15]. The\nother class of solutions is that for which F 6= 0. For such solutions to have a brane\ninterpretation, it is required that they have an asymptotic region which is isometric\nto either R(1,2) \u00d7 R8 or R(1,5) \u00d7 R5 . The former asymptotic behaviour is that of\nM-2-brane while the latter is that of M-5-brane. Then after imposing appropriate\ndecaying conditions on the fields as they approach these asymptotic regions, the\ncharges per unit volume of the M-2- and M-5-branes can be defined as follows:\nZ\nq2 = (\u2217 F \u2212 A \u2227 F ) ,\nS7\n\nwhere S 7 \u2282 R8 , and\nq5 =\n\nZ\n\nF ,\n\nS4\n\nwhere S 4 \u2282 R5 , respectively. Then adapting the positive mass theorem of general\nrelativity to this case, the bounds can be established,\nm2 \u2265 \u03b12 |q2 |\nor\nm5 \u2265 \u03b15 |q5 | ,\nwhere m2 and m5 are the M-2-brane and M-5-brane masses per unit volume, respectively. The manifolds that saturate those bounds admit sixteen parallel spinors\nwith respect to the connection \u2207.\n5\n\n\fTo be specific, the BPS M-2-brane solution [8] is\n1\n\nds2 = h 3 h\u22121 ds2 (R(1,2) ) + ds2 (R8 )\n1\n\u2217\nF = \u2213 \u22c6 dh ,\n2\n\n\u0001\n\nwhere\nh=1+\n\nq2\n|y|6\n\nis a harmonic function on R8 , y \u2208 R8 , the Hodge star operation on F is with\nrespect to the metric g on N and the Hodge star operation on dh is with respect\nto the flat metric on R8 . The M-2-brane is located at y = 0. There are two\nasymptotic regions. One is as |y| \u2192 \u221e, where the spacetime N becomes isometric\nto R(1,2) \u00d7 R8 as expected. The other is as |y| \u2192 0 in which case N becomes\nisometric to AdS4 \u00d7 S 7 ; AdS4 is a Minkowski signature analogue of the standard\nhyperbolic four-manifold. It turns out though that the BPS membrane solution\ndevelops a singularity behind the AdS4 \u00d7 S 7 region.\nThe BPS M-5-brane solution [9] is\n2\n\nds2 = h 3 h\u22121 ds2 (R(1,2) ) + ds2 (R5 )\n1\nF = \u2213 \u22c6 dh ,\n2\n\n\u0001\n\nwhere\nh=1+\n\nq5\n|y|3\n\nis a harmonic function on R5 , y \u2208 R5 and the Hodge star operation on dh is with\nrespect to the flat metric on R5 . The M-5-brane is located at y = 0. There are\nalso two asymptotic regions in this case. One is as |y| \u2192 \u221e where the spacetime\nN becomes isometric to R(1,5) \u00d7 R5 as expected. The other is as |y| \u2192 0 in which\ncase N becomes isometric to AdS7 \u00d7 S 4 ; AdS7 is a Minkowski signature analogue\nof the standard hyperbolic seven-manifold. The BPS M-5-brane solution is not\nsingular.\n6\n\n\fDespite much progress in constructing solutions of eleven-dimensional supergravity which admit parallel spinors, there is no systematic way to tackle the problem of constructing solutions of the theory with any number of parallel spinors.\nOf course this is related to understanding the properties of the connection \u2207. To\ngive an example of the subtleties involved, let us consider the case of solutions\nwith thirty two parallel spinors which is the maximal number possible. A straightforward example of a such spacetime is the Minkowski N = R(1,10) space with\nvanishing F . However, this is not all. There are two more cases, N = AdS4 \u00d7 S 7\nwith F the volume form of AdS4 and N = AdS7 \u00d7 S 4 with F the volume form of\nS 4.\nA related and still unresolved problem is to construct localized solutions of\neleven-dimensional supergravity theory with the interpretation of intersecting M2- and M-5-branes. In particular consistency of the M-theory picture suggests that\nthere should be a solution that has the interpretation of a M-2-brane ending orthogonally on a M-5-brane associated with eight parallel spinors. No such solution\nhas been found so far; For a recent discussion of this see [16]. Other BPS solutions involving M-5-branes and M-2-branes have been found though, like a solution\nwhich has the interpretation of a M-2-brane 'passing through' a M-5-brane [17].\n\n3. Type IIA Strings\nA geometric insight into the properties of the connection \u2207 of eleven-dimensional\nsupergravity can be given after reducing M-theory to type IIA string theory. It\nturns out that in a sector of the supergravity theory associated with type IIA\nstrings, IIA supergravity, the connection \u2207 of the spin bundle is induced from\ncertain connections with torsion of the tangent bundle of spacetime.\nFor this consider the eleven-dimensional spacetime N = S 1 \u00d7 M with\n4\n\n2\n\nds2 (N) = e 3 \u03c6 d\u03b82 + e\u2212 3 \u03c6 ds2 (M)\n\n(3.1)\n\nF = d\u03b8 \u2227 H ,\nwhere \u03b8 is the angle which parameterizes the circle of radius r. It is assumed\n7\n\n\fthat the vector field X =\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03b8\n\nis an isometry of N which leaves in addition F\n\ninvariant. In field theoretic terms, the metric \u03b3 in ds2 (M) describes the graviton\nin ten dimensions, the closed three-form H is the NS \u2297 NS form field strength\nand \u03c6 is the dilaton; \u03b3, H and \u03c6 are the so called common sector fields of string\ntheory. The IIA supergravity has additional fields which can also be derived from\neleven dimensions but the above sector will suffice for our purpose. The type IIA\n3\n\nstring coupling constant is related to the radius of the circle S 1 as \u03bb = r 2 [3]. So\nfor small radius, the string coupling constant is small and M-theory reduces to IIA\nstrings.\nThe dynamics of the common sector fields in ten dimensions can be described\nby the action\nS=\n\nZ\n\nd10 x e\u22122\u03c6\n\np\n\n\u0001\n|det \u03b3| R(\u03b3) \u2212 2|H|2 + 4|d\u03c6|2 ,\n\nwhere the norms are taken with respect to the metric \u03b3 on M.\nAs it has been mentioned, a simplification occurs in the description of the connection \u2207 using N = S 1 \u00d7 M and (3.1) as above. For this, first observe that the\nspin bundle S decomposes as S = S + \u2297 S \u2212 , where S + and S \u2212 are spin bundles\nover M with rank S + = rank S \u2212 = 16. This is due to the decomposition of the\nspinor representation of spin(1, 10) into the sum of the two irreducible spinor representations of spin(1, 9). Next it turns out that the connection \u2207 decomposes into\ntwo connections one on S + and one on S \u2212 which are induced by the connections\n\u2207\u00b1 = D \u00b1 H\nof the tangent bundle, respectively, where D is the Levi-Civita connection of the\nmetric \u03b3. The connections \u2207\u00b1 are metric connections with torsion the closed threeforms \u00b1H, respectively. There are two more conditions that arise from reducing\nthe connection \u2207 of eleven-dimensional supergravity to IIA supergravity which\ninvolve the dilaton \u03c6. However, these two conditions do not give rise to additional\n8\n\n\frestrictions on the parallel spinors of \u2207\u00b1 connections in the examples that we shall\ninvestigate below. So we shall not consider them further.\nThe above simplification in the structure of the connection \u2207 has some profound consequences. One of them is that the existence of parallel spinors with\nrespect to the connection \u2207 of S depends on the holonomy of the connections \u2207\u00b1\nof the tangent bundle of M.\nThe NS-5-brane solution of IIA supergravity [11] is\n\u0001\nds2 (M) = ds2 R(1,5) + hds2 (Q)\n1\nH = \u2213 \u22c6 dh\n2\n2\u03c6\ne =h,\nwhere the Hodge star operation on dh is with respect to the flat metric on R4 and\nh is a harmonic function on R4 = Q, Q is the quaternionic line,\nh = 1+\n\n1\n,\n|q|2\n\nq \u2208 Q. The NS-5-brane is located at q = 0. The spacetime M is diffeomorphic to\n\u0001\nR(1,5) \u00d7 Q \u2212 {0} and it has two asymptotic regions, R(1,5) \u00d7 R4 as |q| \u2192 \u221e and\nR(1,5) \u00d7 R \u00d7 S 3 as |q| \u2192 0. In what follows we shall choose H = \u2212 12 \u22c6 dh.\n\nThe non-trivial part of the metric of M is that on Q \u2212 {0}. To investigate the\n\u0001\ngeometry on Q \u2212 {0} , we introduce two hypercomplex structures I = {I1 , I2 , I3 }\n\nand J = {J1 , J2 , J3 } as follows:\nI1 (dq) = i dq ,\nJ1 (dq) = \u2212dq i ,\n\nI2 (dq) = j dq ,\nJ2 (dq) = \u2212dq j ,\n\nI3 (dq) = k dq ,\nJ3 (dq) = \u2212dq k ,\n\nwhere i, j, k are the imaginary unit quaternions. Observe that the two hypercomplex structures commute, [I, J] = 0. The metric on Q \u2212 {0} is hermitian with\nrespect to both hypercomplex structures. In addition, the hypercomplex structure\n9\n\n\fI is compatible with the \u2207\u2212 connection (\u2207\u2212 I = 0) and the hypercomplex structure J is compatible with the \u2207+ connection (\u2207+ J = 0); Note that the torsion H\nhas support on Q \u2212 {0}. Therefore the holonomy of \u2207\u00b1 is in SU(2). In fact the\nholonomy of \u2207\u00b1 is SU(2) and so the NS-5-brane admits sixteen parallel spinors.\nThis fact follows from representation theory. As it will be demonstrated shortly,\nthe geometry of the NS-5-brane can be summarized by saying that it admits two\ncommuting strong HKT structures.\n\n4. Hyper-K\u00e4hler Manifolds with Torsion\nLet (M, g, J) be a Riemannian hyper-complex manifold with metric g and\nhypercomplex structure J; dimM = 4k. The manifold (M, g, J) admits a HKT\nstructure [18] if\n\u2022 The metric g is hermitian with respect to all three complex structures.\n\u2022 There is a compatible connection \u2207 with both the metric g and the hypercomplex structure J which has torsion a three form H.\nThere are two types of HKT structures on manifolds, the strong and the weak,\ndepending on whether or not the torsion three-form is a closed, respectively.\nTorsion has appeared in the physics literature since the early attempts to incorporate it in a relativistic theory of gravity. In supersymmetry, metric connections\nwith torsion a closed three-form have appeared in the context of IIA and IIB supergravities but the relation to HKT geometry was not established. Connections with\ntorsion a closed three-form appeared next in the investigation of two-dimensional\nsupersymmetric sigma models [19, 20]. For a class of models, the sigma model\nmanifold satisfies conditions which can be organized in one or two copies of what\nit is now called strong HKT structure. The general case of connections with torsion\nany three-form were found in the investigation of one-dimensional supersymmetric\nsigma models [21, 22]. For a class of models, the sigma model manifold satisfies\nconditions which can be organized as one or two copies of what it is now called\n10\n\n\fweak HKT structure. The definition of the HKT structure as a new structure on\nmanifolds was given in [18]. In the same paper, the strong and weak HKT structures were introduced, a formulation of a HKT structure in terms of conditions\non K\u00e4hler forms was given, and a twistor construction for the HKT manifolds\nwas proposed. The latter two properties of HKT manifolds are similar to those of\nhyper-K\u00e4hler manifolds [23]. There is also a generalization of the Quanternionic\nK\u00e4hler structure on manifolds to include torsion. The Quaternionic K\u00e4hler manifolds with torsion (QKT) have been introduced in [24] and further investigated in\n[25]. QKT manifolds admit a twistor construction similar to that of Quaternionic\nK\u00e4hler ones [26].\nA straightforward consequence of the definition of HKT manifolds is that the\nholonomy of the connection \u2207 is in Sp(k). Some other developments related to\nthese connections with three-form torsion are the vanishing theorems of [27, 28]\nfor certain cohomology groups. Many examples of HKT manifolds have been constructed. These include a class of group manifolds with strong HKT structures\nin [29]. Specifically, the Hopf surface S 1 \u00d7 S 3 admits two strong HKT structures.\nHomogeneous weak HKT manifolds have been constructed in [30] using the hypercomplex structures of [31]. Inhomogeneous weak HKT structures have been given\non S 1 \u00d7 S 4k\u22121 in [32].\nIn physics, the NS-5-brane solution constructed in the previous section clearly\nadmits two strong HKT structures each associated with the hypercomplex structures on Q \u2212 {0} defined by left and right quaternionic multiplication, respectively.\nOther examples are certain (strong and weak) HKT structures that appear on the\nmoduli spaces of five-dimensional black holes [22, 33, 34].\nThe HKT structure has many properties some of them found in [18] and more\nhave been derived in [32]. One of them is the following: Let M be hypercomplex\nmanifold with respect to J and equipped with a three-form H. M admits a HKT\nstructure if\nd\u03c9J \u2212 2iJ H = 0 ,\n11\n\n(4.1)\n\n\fwhere \u03c9J are the three K\u00e4hler forms associated with the hyper-complex structure\nand iJ are the inner derivations with respect to the three complex structures. This\nequation will be used later to construct new HKT manifolds. In fact if two of the\nabove conditions are satisfied, they imply the third. Observe also that the torsion\nof an HKT manifold can be specified from the metric and the complex structures\n[18]. So in what follows, we shall not give the expression for the torsion.\n\n5. Quaternionic Calibrations\nCalibrations have been introduced by Harvey and Lawson [35] to construct a\nlarge class of minimal submanifolds. Here, I shall use calibrations to find a new\nclass of solutions of IIA supergravity that has the interpretation of intersecting\nbranes. This new class of solutions admits a strong HKT structure.\nA calibration of degree k is a k-form \u03c9 such that for every k-plane \u03b7 in Rn\n\u2192\n\n\u03c9( \u03b7 ) \u2264 1 ,\n\u2192\n\nwhere \u03b7 is the co-volume form of \u03b7.\nThe contact set G\u03c9 of a calibration is the subset of Gr(k, Rn ) of k-planes that\nsaturate the above bound. Usually G\u03c9 is a homogeneous space. There are many\nexamples of calibrations, like K\u00e4hler and Special Lagrangian, which have been\nextensively investigated both in mathematics and physics. In the present case,\nthe relevant class of calibrations are the quaternionic calibrations that have been\ndescribed by Daroc, Harvey and Morgan in [12]. For this, we identify R8 = Q2\nand introduce the hypercomplex structures I = {I1 , I2 , I3 } and J = {J1 , J2 , J3 } on\nQ2 induced by left and right quaternionic multiplication, respectively, i.e.\nI1 (du) = i du ,\nJ1 (du) = \u2212du i ,\n\nI2 (du) = j du ,\nJ2 (du) = \u2212du j ,\n12\n\nI3 (du) = k du ,\nJ3 (du) = \u2212du k ,\n\n\fwhere i, j, k are the imaginary unit quaternions. In addition, we define\n3\n\n1X\n\u03c9 Jr \u2227 \u03c9 Jr ,\n\u03c6J =\n3\nr=1\n\nwhere \u03c9Jr is the K\u00e4hler form of the Jr complex structure with respect to the\nstandard metric on Q2 , and similarly \u03c6I for I. There are several calibration forms\nthat can be constructed using the K\u00e4hler forms above. The calibration forms\nof quaternionic calibrations are found by averaging the calibration form \u03c6J with\nvarious calibration forms constructed using the I hypercomplex structure. These\ncalibration forms and their contact sets are summarized in the following table:\nQuaternionic Calibrations in R8\nCalibration Form \u03c9\n\u0001\n1\n2 \u03c6I + \u03c6J\n1\n3\n5 \u03c9I 1 \u2227 \u03c9I 1 + 5 \u03c6 J\n1\n4\u03a9\n\nContact Set G\u03c9\nS1\nS2\n\n+ 43 \u03c6J\n\nS3\nS4\n\n\u03c6J\n\nIn the second case above, instead of I1 any other of the complex structures of I\ncan be used. In the third case, the form \u03a9 is the Spin(7) invariant form associated\nwith I. In the last case, the contact set is the grassmannian of quaternionic lines\nin Q2 , Gr(1; Q2 ) = S 4 . The contact sets of the quaternionic calibrations are\ncomputed by observing that the groups that leave invariant the above forms act\ntransitively on the calibrated planes. For more details see [12].\n\n13\n\n\f6. HKT Geometries and Branes\nThe strategy of constructing HKT geometries in eight dimensions is to superpose a HKT geometry on Q \u2212 {0} along four-planes in R8 . The four-planes which\nwill be used are in the contact sets of quaternionic calibrations that has been described in the previous section. The construction [13, 14] involves the following\nsteps:\n(i) Consider the HKT metric\nd\u03c3 2 =\n\n1\ndqdq\u0304\n|q|2\n\n(6.1)\n\non Q \u2212 {0}, where q \u2208 Q. The torsion of this HKT geometry is that of the\nNS-5-brane that we have described.\n(ii) Introduce the maps\n\u03c4:\n\nQ2 \u2192 Q\nu \u2192 \u03c4 (u) = p1 u1 + p2 u2 \u2212 a ,\n\nwhere p1 , p2 , a are quaternions.\n(iii) Define the metric\nds2 =\n\nX\n\nr 2 (\u03c4 )\u03c4 \u2217 d\u03c3 2 + ds2 (Q2 ) ,\n\n\u03c4\n\nwhere the sum is over a finite number of maps \u03c4 , r(\u03c4 ) \u2208 R and ds2 (Q2 ) is\nthe standard flat metric on Q2 .\nThe manifold K = Q2 \u2212 \u222a\u03c4 {\u03c4 \u22121 (0)} admits a HKT structure associated with\nthe hypercomplex structure J induced by the hypercomplex structure J on Q2 .\nTo show this, the torsion of the HKT structure on K is given by pulling back\nthe torsion of the NS-5-brane with respect to the maps \u03c4 and then summing up\nover the various maps \u03c4 . The key observation is that the differential d\u03c4 commutes\n14\n\n\fwith the hypercomplex structures on Q \u2212 {0} and K defined by right quaternionic\nmultiplication. Using this, the condition (4.1) for K can be written as\nX\n\u03c4\n\n\u0001\n\u03c4 \u2217 d\u03c9J \u2212 2iJ H = 0 ,\n\nwhere the expression inside the brackets is that of the condition (4.1) for the HKT\nstructure (i) on Q \u2212 {0} and so vanishes identically. Thus K admits a HKT\nstructure with respect to the \u2207+ connection and J hypercomplex structure.\nObserve that d\u03c4 for generic parameters {p1 , p2 } does not commute with the\nhypercomplex structure induced by left quaternionic multiplication on Q \u2212 {0}\nand K. So K does not admit a HKT structure with respect to this hypercomplex\nstructure.\nTo make connection with the calibrations of the previous sections as promised,\nwe consider a HKT geometry constructed using several maps \u03c4 with generic parameters (p1 , p2 ; a). Such a HKT geometry is independent from the parameterization\nof the maps \u03c4 and depends only on the arrangements of quaternionic lines \u03c4 \u22121 (0)\nin Q2 . To see this, observe that two maps \u03c4 and \u03c4 \u2032 give the same HKT structure\nif their parameters are related as\n(p\u20321 , p\u20322 ; a\u2032 ) = (up1 , up2 ; ua)\nfor some u \u2208 Q, u 6= 0. So the inequivalent HKT structures associated with each\nmap \u03c4 are parameterized by the bundle space of the canonical quaternionic line\nbundle over the Grassmannian Gr(1; Q2 ). In turn the quaternionic lines defined\nby Ker d\u03c4 are in Gr(1; Q2 ) which is precisely the contact set of last calibration in\nthe table given in the previous section. Observe that the calibration form and the\nHKT connection \u2207+ are compatible with the same hypercomplex structure J.\nThe HKT geometries that we are considering are complete provided that the\nsubspaces \u03c4 \u22121 (0) are in general position. Near the intersection of two such subspaces, the HKT metric is isometric to that of (Q \u2212 {0}) \u00d7 (Q \u2212 {0}), where the\nmetric on Q \u2212 {0} is given as in (6.1).\n15\n\n\fFinally, the above HKT geometries can be used to construct new solutions of\nIIA supergravity as\nds2 (M) = ds2 (R(1,1) ) + ds2 (K)\n1\n\ne2\u03c6 = (det\u03b3) 4 .\nThe IIA supergravity three-form field strength H is given is terms of the torsion\nof the HKT manifold K. The brane interpretation of such solution is that of NS5-branes intersecting on a string. The NS-5-brane associated with the map \u03c4 is\nlocated at \u03c4 \u22121 (0).\n\n7. Special Cases\nAs we have seen for a generic choice of maps \u03c4 the HKT geometries in eight\ndimensions found in the previous section were associated with quaternionic lines\nin Q2 given by Ker d\u03c4 . This establishes a correspondence between HKT geometries and quaternionic calibrations with calibration form \u03c6J . This correspondence\ncan be extended to the rest of the quaternionic calibrations. For this, instead of\nconsidering generic maps \u03c4 with parameters (p1 , p2 ; a) to construct the HKT geometries, we restrict them in an appropriate way. There are four cases to consider,\nincluding the HKT geometry on K that has been mentioned above, as illustrated\nin the following table:\nHKT Geometries in Eight Dimensions\nKer d\u03c4\n\np\u03041 p2\nR\n\nS1\n\nC\n\nS2\n\nImQ\n\nS3\n\nQ\n\nS4\n\nIn the first column we denote the restriction on the parameters of the map and\nin the second column the set that ker d\u03c4 lies as we vary the map \u03c4 in the same\n16\n\n\fclass. Comparing the above table with that which contains the contact sets of\nquaternionic calibrations in section five, we observe that ker d\u03c4 lies in a contact set\nin all four cases.\nThe holonomy groups of the connections \u2207\u00b1 in each of the above cases are\ngiven in the following table:\np\u03041 p2 :\n\nR\n\nC\n\nImQ\n\nQ\n\n\u2207\u2212 :\n\nSp(2)\n\nSU(4)\n\nSpin(7)\n\nSO(8)\n\n\u2207+ :\n\nSp(2)\n\nSp(2)\n\nSp(2)\n\nSp(2)\n\nThe holonomy of \u2207+ is in Sp(2) in all cases because it is compatible with the\nJ hypercomplex structure. Now if p\u03041 p2 is real for all \u03c4 involved in the construction\nof HKT geometry, then d\u03c4 commutes with the hypercomplex structures of K and\nQ \u2212 {0} induced by left quaternionic multiplication. This leads to another HKT\nstructure on M compatible with the \u2207\u2212 connection. So the holonomy of \u2207\u2212 is in\nSp(2) as well. This HKT geometry was found in [36] and a special case in [37]. If\np\u03041 p2 is complex, say, with respect to the I1 complex structure, then d\u03c4 commutes\nwith the complex structures of K and Q \u2212 {0} induced by left quaternionic multiplication with the quaternionic unit i. This makes the \u2207\u2212 connection compatible\nwith the I1 complex structure which implies that the holonomy of \u2207\u2212 is in U(4).\nIn fact it turns out that the holonomy of \u2207\u2212 is in SU(4). Observe that the K\u00e4hler\nform of I1 appears in the construction of the calibration form in this case. A similar\nanalysis can be done for the remaining case.\nSome of the above HKT geometries can be related to toric hyper-K\u00e4hler geometries [23, 36]. In particular, the HKT geometries associated with maps \u03c4 such\nthat p\u03041 p2 \u2208 R are T-dual (mirror symmetry) to toric hyper-K\u00e4hler manifolds [22].\nIn this case mirror symmetry transforms manifolds of one class, HKT manifolds, to\nmanifolds of another class, hyper-K\u00e4hler manifolds. This is because the T-duality\nabove is performed as many times as the number of tri-holomorphic vector fields\nof the toric hyper-K\u00e4hler manifold which is less than the middle dimension of the\n17\n\n\fmanifold. This is unlike the case of mirror symmetry for Calabi-Yau spaces where\nT-duality is performed in as many directions as the middle dimension of the manifold [38]. The HKT geometries with p\u03041 p2 \u2208 R also appear in the context moduli\nspaces of a class of black holes in five dimensions [22].\nIt is of interest to ask the question whether it is possible to construct supergravity solutions which have the interpretation of intersecting branes using other\ncalibrations from those employed above. To be more specific instead of the quaternionic calibrations, one may also use K\u00e4hler or special Lagrangian calibrations to\ndo the superposition. Unfortunately, in both these cases, a superposition similar\nto that employed for quaternionic calibrations does not lead to solutions of supergravity field equations. This may due to the fact that the resulting geometries\ndepend on the particular parameterization of the maps \u03c4 . On the other hand\nstring perturbation theory considerations seem to suggest that superpositions of\nthe kind employed above lead to BPS brane configurations [39, 40, 41]. However, it\nis not known how to construct in a systematic way the corresponding supergravity\nsolution from a BPS brane configuration of string theory.\n\n8. Concluding Remarks\nThe understanding of the non-perturbative properties of string theory requires\nthe investigation of various solitons. In the low energy approximation these solitons\nhave an interpretation as branes or as intersecting branes and are solutions of\nvarious supergravity theories. A class of such solutions was presented and their\nconstruction was related to quaternionic calibrations.\nThe problem of finding the intersecting brane solutions of supergravity theories\nhas not been tackled in complete generality. Although many examples of such\nsolutions are known, there does not seem to be a systematic way to find a solution\nfor each BPS brane configuration of string theory. The resolution of this will\nrequire a better understanding of the supercovariant derivative of supergravity\ntheories. The method of calibrations that I have presented led to the construction\n18\n\n\fof a large class of these solutions but it has limitations some of which has already\nmentioned. However, the solutions that we are seeking for which the form field\nstrengths do not vanish (F 6= 0) are in the same universality class as hyper-K\u00e4hler,\nCalabi-Yau and other special holonomy manifolds as far as the holonomy of the\nsupercovariant connections of the supergravity theories is concerned. So it may\nbe that powerful methods of algebraic and differential geometry that have been\ndeveloped to construct examples of the latter may be extended to find examples\nof the former.\nAfter the end of the conference, the moduli space of a class of five-dimensional\nblack holes was determined and it was found to be a weak HKT manifold [33]. This\nresult was further generalized in [34] to a larger class of four- and five-dimensional\nblack holes. The moduli spaces of all five-dimensional black holes that admit at\nleast four parallel spinors are HKT manifolds.\n\nAcknowledgments: I would like to thank the organizers of the Second Meeting\non \"Quaternionic Structures in Mathematics and Physics\" for their kind invitation\nand their warm welcome at the conference.
