We also give a sufficient condition for\n(f m , \u03bc) to satisfy the Central Limit Theorem. In some sense, we give a\nfairly complete global picture of the dynamics of such maps. Similarly,\nwe can get similar statistical properties for interval maps with critical\npoints and discontinuities under some more assumptions.\n\n1. Introduction and statement of results\n1.1. Introduction. In the last three decades, many results on statistical\nproperties were obtained for iterations of one dimensional maps, for example the existence of absolutely continuous invariant probability measures\n(acip for short), the decay of correlations and the Central Limit Theorem.\nVarious conditions have been shown to guarantee the existence of acip and\ncorresponding statistical properties. In the area of interval maps with turning points (including critical points, discontinuities), these results generally\nrequire more restriction on the turning points, for example the critical orders of each turning point from two sides are equal in the continuous cases,\nand positive Lyapunov exponents at the critical values and the recurrence\nof turning point are sub-exponential in the discontinuous cases.\nOur aim in this paper is to obtain the same conclusion but relax as much\nas possible the conditions on the orbit of the critical points, to include in\nparticular cases in which the growth of derivatives may be sub-exponential\nand/or the recurrence of the turning points exponential, or the critical orders\nof turning points from both sides do not equal. More precisely, we will show\nthe existence and finiteness of the number of acip for a general map under\ntwo summability conditions on the growth of derivatives and recurrence\nalong the turning points, and study its statistical properties such as decay\nDate: November 3, 2018.\nMathematical classification (2000): 37E05, 28D05, 37D25.\nThis work was partly supported by the NSFC grant 60534080.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nH. CUI\n\nof correlations and the Central Limit Theorem. In these processes, we give\na complete global picture of the dynamics from a probabilistic perspective.\n1.2. Dynamical assumption. We now give the precise statement of our\nassumption. Let A denote the class of the interval map satisfying the conditions formulated in Subsections 1.2.1-1.2.2 below. Denote A1 as continuous\nmaps in A and A2 as discontinuous maps in A respectively.\n1.2.1. Critical set. Let M be a compact interval [0, 1] and f : M \u2192 M\nbe a piecewise C 2 map. This means that there exists a finite set C such\nthat f is C 2 and a diffeomorphism on each component of M \\ C, and f\nadmits a continuous extension to the boundary so that both the left and\nthe right limits f (c\u00b1) = limx\u2192c\u00b1 f (x) exist. We regard each c \u2208 C as two\npoints: c+, c\u2212, the concrete values depend on the corresponding one-side\nneighborhoods. We assume that each c \u2208 C has a one-side critical order\nl(c\u00b1) \u2208 [1, \u221e), this means that\n\n|Df (x)| \u2248 |x \u2212 c|l(c\u00b1)\u22121 , |f (x)\u2212f (c\u00b1)| \u2248 |x \u2212 c|l(c\u00b1) , and |D 2 f (x)| \u2248 |x \u2212 c|l(c\u00b1)\u22122\n\nfor x in the corresponding one-side neighborhood of c, where we say f \u2248 g\nif the ratio f /g is bounded above and below uniformly in its domain. When\nwe use the notion l(c), it may be either l(c+) or l(c\u2212). If l(c) = 1, c is a\nbound derivative point, and if l(c) > 1 we say that c is a critical point. Note\nthat c may be a critical point on one side and is a bound derivative point on\nthe other side. When there is no possibility of confusion, each point c \u2208 C\nwill be called a critical point without distinguishing whether c is really a\ncritical point with l(c) > 1, or c is a bounded derivative point with l(c) = 1.\nWe also assume that f is with negative Schwarzian derivative outside of C,\n1\ni.e., |Df |\u2212 2 is a convex function on each component of M \\ C. In particular,\nif f is continuous, and the critical orders with l(c) > 1 are equal from two\nsides for each critical point, we can get rid of this assumption (but need to\nadd a natural topological assumption that all period points are hyperbolic\nrepelling) by a result of Kozlovski [15] (generalized to the multimodal setting\nby van Strien and Vargas [26]).\n1.2.2. Summability conditions. We suppose f satisfies the following summability conditions along the critical orbits. The first summability condition\nis\n\n(1)\n\n\u221e \u0010\nX\n\nn=1\n\n|f n (c) \u2212 c\u0303|l(c\u0303)\n\n|f n (c) \u2212 c\u0303|l(c) |Df n (f (c))|\n\n\u00111/(2l(c)\u22121)\n\n< \u221e, \u2200c \u2208 C,\n\nwhere c\u0303 is the critical point closest to f n (c), and l(c), l(c\u0303) depend on the corresponding one-side neighborhoods, and the second summability condition\nis\n\u221e\nX\n\u00011/l(c)\n1\n< \u221e, \u2200c \u2208 C.\n(2)\n|Df n (f (c))|\nn=1\n\nOne of the most simplest example satisfying the above conditions is the\ncontracting Lorenz maps considered in [20] and [24], which motivated by\n\n\fSTATISTICAL PROPERTIES OF INTERVAL MAPS\n\n3\n\nthe study of the return map of the Lorenz equations near classical parameter values. Notice that above summability conditions are satisfied if the\nderivative is growing exponentially fast and the recurrence is not faster than\nexponential in the sense that for each critical point c \u2208 C, |Df n (f (c))| > \u03bbn ,\nfor some \u03bb > 1, and |f n\u22121 (f (c)) \u2212 C| > e\u2212\u03b1n for some \u03b1 small enough, for\nall n \u2265 1.\nRemark 1. According to the first summability condition, critical points of\nf \u2208 A are not on the forward orbits of the critical set, i.e., C \u2229 \u222an\u22651 f n (C) =\n\u2205. It is easy to see that if all of the critical orders are equal, one can get rid\nof the recurrence condition containing in the first summability condition.\n1.3. Statement of results. In a previous paper, we have shown the following theorem under some weaker summability conditions,\nTheorem 1. [10] If f satisfies assumption in Subsection 1.2.1 and summability condition (2), and the following summability condition\n\u221e \u0010\nX\n\nn=1\n\n|f n (c) \u2212 c\u0303|l(c\u0303)\n\n|f n (c) \u2212 c\u0303|l(c) |Df n (f (c))|\n\n\u00111/l(c)\n\n< \u221e, \u2200c \u2208 C,\n\nthen f admits an acip. Furthermore, if lmax > 1, then its density is in Lp\nlmax\nfor all 1 \u2264 p < lmax\n\u22121 , where lmax is the maximum of the orders of the\ncritical points.\nIn this paper, we will consider the general properties of acip, including\nthe finiteness of acip, the support of each acip and its properties (decay\nof correlations, Central Limit theorem). In general, if f has many turning\npoints, the acip \u03bc need not to be unique and not Lebesgue ergodic (note that\nunimodal maps with negative Schwarzian derivative and equal critical orders\nfrom both sides are ergodic with respect to Lebsegue measure). If f \u2208 A1 ,\nthen we can choose the minimal cycle (see Section 3) of f , show that there\nexists a unique acip \u03bc support on the minimal cycle and the renormalization\nf m of f corresponding the minimal cycle is exact, hence (f m , \u03bc) is mixing\nand ergodic. So it is natural to estimate the rates of mixing, quantified\nthrough the correlation functions\nZ\nZ\nZ\nCn (f m , \u03bc) := | (\u03c6 \u25e6 f m )\u03c8d\u03bc \u2212 \u03c6d\u03bc \u03c8d\u03bc|,\n\nwhere \u03c6 and \u03c8 are respectively bounded and H\u00f6lder continuous functions\non the minimal cycle.\nAnother important characterization of \u03bc is by Central\nTheorem,\nPn\u22121 Limit\n\u03c6(f j (x)) around\nwhich describes the oscillations of finite averages n1 j=0\nR\nthe expect value \u03c6d\u03bc. We say that (f m , \u03bc) satisfies the Central Limit\nTheorem if given a H\u00f6lder continuous functions \u03c6 which is not coboundary\n(\u03c6 6= \u03c8 \u25e6 f \u2212 \u03c8 for any \u03c8), then there exists \u03c3 > 0 such that for any interval\nI \u2282 R,\nZ\nZ\nn\u22121\nn\no\n\u0001\nt2\n1 X\n1\ne\u2212 2\u03c32 dt, as n \u2192 \u221e.\n\u03bc x \u2208 M; \u221a\n\u03c6\u25e6(f j (x))\u2212 \u03c6d\u03bc \u2208 I \u2192 \u221a\nn\n\u03c3 2\u03c0 I\nj=0\n\n\f4\n\nH.

Let f \u2208 A1 , then there exists at least one and at most \u266fC different ergodic acips \u03bci , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N . These measures are support on minimal\ncycles of intervals with pairwise disjoint interiors. Over each such cycles\nthere exists a renormalization (f mi , \u03bci ) that is exact. For a fixed minimal\ncycle with critical point Cc , the corresponding renormalization (f m , \u03bc) is\nmixing with the following rates:\nPolynomial case: If dn (c) \u2264 Cn\u2212\u03b1 , \u03b1 > 1, C > 0 for all c \u2208 Cc and\nn \u2265 1, then for each \u03b1\u0303 < \u03b1 \u2212 1, there exists C\u0303 > 0 such that\nCn (f m , \u03bc) \u2264 C\u0303n\u2212\u03b1\u0303 .\n\n\u03b1\n\nStretched exponential case: If \u03b3n (c) \u2264 Ce\u2212\u03b2n , C > 0, \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1), \u03b2 > 0\nfor all c \u2208 Cc and n \u2265 1, then for each \u03b1\u0303 \u2208 (0, \u03b1) there exist \u03b2\u0303, C\u0303 > 0 such\nthat\n\u03b1\u0303\nCn (f m , \u03bc) \u2264 C\u0303e\u2212\u03b2\u0303n .\nExponential case: If \u03b3n (c) \u2264 Ce\u2212\u03b2n , \u03b2 > 0 for all c \u2208 Cc and n \u2265 1, then\nthere exist \u03b2\u0303, C\u0303 > 0 such that\nCn (f m , \u03bc) \u2264 C\u0303e\u2212\u03b2\u0303n .\nIf dn (c) \u2264 Cn\u2212\u03b1 , C > 0, \u03b1 > 2 for c \u2208 Cc and n \u2265 1, then (f m , \u03bc)\nsatisfies the Central Limit theorem. If lmax > 1 for critical point in the\nlmax\nminimal cycle, then the density of \u03bc is Lp for all 1 \u2264 p < lmax\n\u22121 . The union\nof the basin B(\u03bci ) has full probability measure in the interval M .\nFor a map f \u2208 A2 , we suppose f satisfies the following\nDensity of preimages: There exists c \u2208 C whose preimages are dense\nin some J \u2217 \u2208 M , where J \u2217 is a union of intervals and satisfies f (J \u2217 ) = J \u2217 .\nRemark 2.

The story about the existence of acip of interval maps has a long history, see [17] and reference therein for a comprehensive\nsurvey. Quit general conditions are known to guarantee the existence of acip\nfor uniformly expanding maps, for smooth maps with critical points (for Sunimodal maps satisfying Collect-Eckmann condition in [9] and Nowicki-van\nStrien condition in [23], and for multimodal maps under the most general\ncondition in this setting [5] recently), for interval maps with critical points\nand singularities under summability conditions in [1] recently, for smooth\nmaps with a countable number of critical point in [2]. Notice that the results\non the smooth case use weaker assumptions than the case of interval maps\nwith critical points and discontinuities, an observation is that we only consider the derivatives of the critical value on the smooth case [6, 5], while we\nshould need the assumption that the recurrence of the critical point is not\nincreasing rapidly for interval maps with critical points and discontinuities.\nOn the other hand, the results on the existence of acip in smooth case need\nan assumption that the critical orders of each critical point should equal\nfrom two sides in general.\nThe results regarding decay of correlations and the Central Limit Theorem\nfor the unimodal maps with same critical orders were proved in [27, 14]. In\n[27], Young considered quadratic maps satisfying Collect-Eckmann condition\nand critical recurrence at a sufficiently slow exponential rate, and proved\nthat such maps have exponential decay of correlations and satisfy the Central\nLimit Theorem. Independently, Keller and Nowicki [14] obtained the same\nresults for S-unimodal maps (with same critical orders) satisfying only the\nCollet-Eckmann condition. Later, in [4], Bruin et.al considered multimodal\nmaps (with the same critical orders for all critical points and l(c) > 1, \u2200c \u2208\nC, note not only from both sides), obtained the same results to Theorem 2\n1\nP\n\u2212 2l(c)\u22121\nn\n< \u221e. Moreover,\nunder the summability condition \u221e\nn=0 |Df (f (c))|\nthe construction in that paper made it possible to show a direct link between\nthe rate of decay of correlations and the rate of growth of |Df n (f (c))|.\nCedervall [8] considered the interval maps with critical points ( l(c) > 2,\ncritical orders may not equal, but need the critical orders of each critical\npoint are equal from two sides) under the assumption the Collet-Eckmann\ncondition and subexponential recurrence conditions, and proved that such\nmaps have finite number of acips, and exponential decay of correlations and\nthe Central Limit Theorem. For the contracting Lorenz map f satisfying\n|Df n (f (c\u00b1))| > \u03bbn , for each n \u2265 1 and some \u03bb > 1, and |f n\u22121 (f (c\u00b1))\u2212c| >\n\n\f6\n\nH. CUI\n\ne\u2212\u03b1n for some \u03b1 small enough, and for all n \u2265 1, it was shown that f admits\nan acip which has exponential decay of correlations in [20].\nFor interval maps with critical points and singularities, it was obtained\nexponential decay of correlations and Central Limit Theorem, but need more\nadditional assumptions in [12, 11, 18]. Observe that the decay of correlations\nand Central Limit Theorem hold for non-H\u00f6lder observables in [11, 18].\nNote that in the unimodal cases (continuous) with same critical orders\nfrom two sides, |Df n (f (c))| \u2265 Ce\u03bbn , C > 0, \u03bb > 0 if and only if there is a\nrenormalizaiton f n with exponential decay of correlations [22]. We are not\nsure whether it holds for unidmodal maps with different orders from two\nsides, but according Theorem 2, we can get that if the unique critical point\nsatisfies \u03b3n (c) \u2264 Ce\u2212\u03b2n for C > 0 and \u03b2 > 0, then there is a renormalizaiton\nf n with exponential decay of correlations.\nIf 0 < l(c) < 1, c is called a singular point. Since the negative Schwarzian\nderivative condition rules out the existence of singularities, once one can get\nrid of the negative Schwarzian derivative condition, the results in this paper\nmay easily generalized to interval maps with critical points and singularities.\n2. Ideas and organization of the proof\nTo obtain decay of correlations and the Central Limit Theorem of interval\nmaps, a useful technique is based on Frobenius-Perron operator or transfer\noperator. Exponential decay corresponds to a gap in the spectrum of this\noperator, various technique has been developed for proving the existence of\nthis gap. For example, in [16], it was shown that the Frobenius-Perron operator is contracting with respect to Hilbert metric on defined cones of density\nfunctions for an expanding map. Another powerful tool was proposed by\nYoung in [28][29]. She has shown that for an induced Markov map, the upbound of the decay of correlations are strongly related to the tail estimates\nof the inducing time. Notice the method in [28][29] could capture mixing\nrates that are slower than exponential rates.\nOur strategy is to apply the results of Young in [29], so it is crucial\nfor us to construct an induced Markov map based on the general maps we\nconsidered. Induced Markov map has been constructed before for unimodal\nmaps with equal critical orders and satisfying Collet-Eckmann condition, for\nmultimodal maps with P\nequal critical orders (not only from two sides) and the\nsummabilty condition n |Df n (f (c))|\u22121/(2l(c)\u22121) < \u221e for any c \u2208 C [4], for\nmultimodal maps with critical points ( l(c) > 2 critical orders may not equal,\nbut need the critical orders of each critical point from two sides are equal)\nunder the assumption the Collet-Eckmann condition and subexponential\nrecurrence conditions [8]. Observed that all the critical orders are equal\n(from both sides) is necessary in the construction in [4][8].\nIn order to carry out almost the same construction [4] of an induced\nMarkov map with corresponding estimates when the critical points are allowed to have different orders from two sides, we need do some modifications.\nFirstly, we need a new definition of binding period, which involves the recurrence of the critical points, see the details of the proof on Lemma 5 in\nSection 3. Secondly, we shall prove the nonexistence of wandering intervals\nand backward bound contraction property (BBC) for maps in A, but we\n\n\fSTATISTICAL PROPERTIES OF INTERVAL MAPS\n\n7\n\nhave shown these results under a weaker condition in [10] for interval maps\nwithout singularities, recently.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 3, for f \u2208 A1 , we identify the topological attractor and metric attractor, and consider the intervals\nin the attractor. We use a binding argument to obtain some estimations of\ngrowth in terms of the derivative and recurrence along the appropriate critical orbits. Similarly, we derived the same estimates for f \u2208 A2 on J \u2217 . In\nSection 4, for f \u2208 A1 , we choose any interval J in the minimal cycle, and\nconstruct an induced Markov map on J which has uniformly distortion and\nof the image bounded below on each element of the partition of J. Then we\ngive the induced time estimates. In Section 5, we construct a full Markov\nmap for an appropriate interval based on the induced map constructed in\nSection 4. We also state some estimates about this full Markov map. In\nSection 6, we apply Young's result and present the proof of Theorem 2 and\nTheorem 3. For readers who are familiar to the construction in [4], they can\nskip Sections 4,5, except the proof of Lemma 9.\n3. Notations and some estimates\nFor f \u2208 A1 , we will identify the attractors of f which be both topological\nand metric in this Section, then we shall restrict f to the attractors. For\nf \u2208 A2 , we restrict f to the interval J \u2217 directly. Taking a small interval in\nthe each attractor (or J \u2217 ), we use a binding argument to obtain estimates in\nterms of the derivatives and recurrence along the appropriate critical orbit.\nSimilar argument have been applied before by Jakobson [13] and Benedicks\nand Carleson [3] under the strong conditions on Df n (f (c)) and on the recurrence along the critical orbit. The way we defined here is imitated on [4],\nbut [4] only consider the growth of Df n (f (c)) in the definition of the binding period, without the assumption on the rate of recurrence. However, our\ndefinition of binding period relates the recurrence of f n (c), then it is useful\nto tackle the case that the critical points have different orders (including\ndifferent orders from both sides). This is the main point of this work.\nA point is called a period point if f n (x) = x for integer n > 0, it is\nattracting if its basin include a interior. A general notation of period orbit\nis the cycle of interval, if J \u2282 M is a nontrivial closed interval for which\nthere exists a positive integer n such that f n (J) \u2282 J and n is the least such\ninteger, we call the set \u222ani=0 f i (J) a cycle of intervals for f with period n.\nIf the interiors of intervals in the cycle are pairwise disjoint we say that the\ncycle is proper. If a cycle contains no small cycle, we say it is minimal. If f\nhas a proper cycle \u222ani=0 f i (J), define g : M \u2192 M by g = \u039b\u22121 \u25e6 f n \u25e6 \u039b, where\n\u039b is an affine transformation from M onto J. We say g is a renormalization\nof f .\nThe following Lemma collects some basic properties of proper cycle and\nminimal cycle for continuous maps on M .\nLemma 1. Let f be a continuous map on M , then we have the following\nstatements:\n(1) the minimal cycle is a proper cycle,\n(2) minimal cycles ether coincide or have disjoint interiors.\n\n\f8\n\nH. CUI\n\nProof. These follow from the definition of the proper cycle and the minimal\ncycle immediately.\n\u0003\nProposition 1. If f is a map in A1 , then f has finite renormalizations,\nand f has at least one and at most \u266fC minimal cycles. Moreover, \u222ai=0 f \u2212i (c)\nfor each c in the minimal cycle is dense in the corresponding minimal cycle.\nProof. At first, since f satisfies some summability conditions and negative\nSchwarzian derivative, f has no attracting or neutral periodic orbits by\nSinger's Theorem [25]. On the other hand, f has no wandering interval by\n[10], thus from the contraction principle, there exists \u03b4 > 0 such that for\nany interval J \u2208 M with |J| > 0, there exists NJ > 0 such that we have\nf n (J) > \u03b4 for n > NJ , Hence all intervals constituting a cycle have the\nlength greater than \u03b4, this implies that the period of any proper cycle is\nbound by \u03b4\u22121 . Thus f has a finite number of renormalizations.\nNext, we suppose that all intervals in a cycle \u222ani=0 f i (J) don't contain a\nturning point of f in its interior, then f n or f 2n is monotone increasing\nand continuous on J, and f n (J) \u2282 J or f 2n (J) \u2282 J, this contradicts f\nhas no attracting or neutral period orbits, then f has at most \u266fC minimal\ncycles. On the other hand, if M is not a minimal cycle of period one, by\nthe finiteness of proper cycles, then there is a cycle could contain no small\ncycle, i.e., this is a minimal cycle.\nFinally, we consider a minimal cycle \u222ani=0 f i (J), c is a critical point in\nn\n\u222ai=0 f i (J). Because f has no wandering interval, and has no attracting and\nneutral periodic orbits, f has no homterval. Therefore, any small interval in\nthe cycle will eventually visit the critical point in the cycle. If the preimages\nof c isn't dense in the minimal cycle, we can find a cycle smaller the minimal\ncycle, this would induce a contradiction.\n\u0003\ni\nFor f \u2208 A1 and each minimal cycle X := \u222am\ni=0 f (J) with period m,\ndenote Cc \u2208 C as critical set in X, we will consider the subsystem (X, f m ).\nFor f \u2208 A2 , we consider the subsystem (J \u2217 , f ) directly, denote Cc \u2208 C as\ncritical set in J \u2217 too.\nFor x \u2208 X or x \u2208 J \u2217 , let c be the critical point closest to x, Given a\ncritical neighborhood \u25b3 of Cc , we define the binding period as follows,\n\n(5)\np(x) :=\n\nn\no\n(\nmax p; |f k (x) \u2212 f k (c)| \u2264 \u03b3k (c)|f k (c) \u2212 C|, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 p \u2212 1\n0\n\nx \u2208 \u25b3,\n\nx\u2208\n/ \u25b3.\n\nThe size of the critical neighborhood \u25b3 depends on the following Lemmas.\n\nLemma 2.

For an arbitrary interval J \u2282 X with |J| \u2265\n\u03b4\u2032\u2032 , there exists a countable partition P\u0302 of J and an induced time function\np\u0302 : P\u0302 \u2192 N constant on each element w of P\u0302 , such that the induced map\nF\u0302 = f p\u0302(x) (x) has uniformly bounded distortion and |F\u0302 (w)| = |f p\u0302(w) (w)| \u2265 \u03b4\u2032 .\nMoreover, it satisfies the following estimates.\n(1)(Summability induced time)\nX\n|{p\u0302 > n|J}| < \u221e.\nn\n\n(2)(Polynomial inducing time) If dn (c) < Cn\u2212\u03b1 , C > 0, \u03b1 > 1 for all\nc \u2208 Cc and n \u2265 1, then there exists \u0108 > 0 such that\n|{p\u0302 > n|J}| < \u0108n\u2212\u03b1 .\n\n\u03b1\n\n(3)(Stretched exponential case) If \u03b3n (c) < Ce\u2212\u03b2n , C > 0, \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1),\n\u03b2 > 0 for all c \u2208 Cc and n \u2265 1, then for each \u03b1\u0302 \u2208 (0, \u03b1), there exist \u03b2\u0302, \u0108 > 0\nsuch that\n\u03b1\u0302\n|{p\u0302 > n|J}| < \u0108e\u2212\u03b2\u0302n .\n\n(4)(Exponential case) If \u03b3n (c) < Ce\u2212\u03b2n , C > 0, \u03b2 > 0 for all c \u2208 Cc and\nn \u2265 1, then there exist \u03b2\u0302, \u0108 > 0 such that\n|{p\u0302 > n|J}| < \u0108e\u2212\u03b2\u0302n .\nAt first, we clarify the role of the constant and some notations in the\nabove Proposition. Let \u25b31 = \u222ac\u2208Cc (c \u2212 2\u03b4 , c + 2\u03b4 ), using a result in [10], i.e.,\n1\n\nfor any Borel set A, there exists C > 0 such that |f \u2212n (A)| \u2264 C|A| lmax , then\nthere exists \u03b4\u2032 > 0 such that for each component w \u2208 \u25b31 \\Cc and each n \u2265 0,\n\n\f12\n\nH.

For each subinterval w = Ip \u2229 J, let\n\u03bd1 = min{n \u2265 0; f n (w) \u2229 \u25b31 6= \u2205},\n\nbe the first visit of w to \u25b31 , denote w\u0303 = f \u03bd1 (w), we distinguish two cases:\n(1). |w\u0303| < \u03b4\u2032 , we subdivide w\u0303 with the elements {Ip }. Each interval Ip \u2229 w\u0303\nfor p > 0 is labeled as deep return. Notice that by the choice of \u03b4\u2032 , each\nreturn in this case is a deep return.\n(2). |w\u0303| \u2265 \u03b4\u2032 , we cut off two side intervals of length \u01eb from w\u0303, where \u01eb\nis a small parameter to be fixed (see Lemma 9). The middle part is called\nthe large scale, add the sub interval w0 \u2282 w to the partition that f \u03bd1 (w0 )\nis equals to this middle part of w\u0303, and stop to work on this middle part.\nSuppose that w\u0303\u00b1 are the two pieces of length \u01eb that are cut off, we subdivide\nw\u0303\u00b1 further by the elements in {Ip }. Each interval Ip \u2229 w\u0303\u00b1 for p > 0 is labeled\nas deep return, I0 \u2229 w\u0303\u00b1 is labeled as shallow return.\nLet w\u2032 be a partition interval by {Ip } in w\u0303 which has not reached the\nlarge scale, denote the binding period by p(w\u2032 ), let\n\u03bd2 = \u03bd1 + min{n \u2265 p(w\u2032 ); f n (w\u2032 ) \u2229 \u25b31 6= \u2205}.\n\nThen we subdivide f \u03bd2 \u2212\u03bd1 (w\u2032 ) according above rules, stop until some parts\nreach the large scale. Notice that we have applied binding period (if exist)\ntime iteration to guarantee expansion after each return time if it has not\nreach large scale.\nWe then construct inductively a sequence of partitions P\u0302n by only considering at most n iterates, denote P\u0302 by the partition of J by considering\nall iterates of f .\nLet x \u2208 w where the above algorithm eventually stops, then there exists\nn > 0 such that x \u2208 P\u0302n , denote the stopping time by P\u0302J (x) = n, otherwise,\nset P\u0302J (x) = \u221e.\nLet J\u02c6 = {x \u2208 J; P\u0302J (x) < \u221e}, we have defined the induced map\nF\u0302J : J\u02c6 \u2192 M, F\u0302J (x) = f P\u0302J (x) (x).\n\nIn next subsection we will show J\u02c6 is a partition of J up to a set of zero\nLebesgue measure, and give the corresponding estimates of F\u0302J , but now we\n\u02c6 Given an interval w in some partition\nfirst want to know the structure of J.\nP\u0302n , n > 0, we associated it with a sequence\n(\u03bd1 , p1 ), (\u03bd2 , p2 ), . . . , (\u03bds , ps ),\n1In fact, it suffices to choose \u03b4 \u2032 so that f i (w) \u2265 \u03b4 \u2032 for each w \u2208 \u25b3 \\C and 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n =\n1\nc\n\nmin{k; Int(f i (w)) \u2229 C =\n6 \u2205}, where Int(f i (w) is the interior point of f i (w).\n\n\fSTATISTICAL PROPERTIES OF INTERVAL MAPS\n\n13\n\nwhere \u03bdi , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 s is the return times to \u25b31 , pi is the corresponding periods,\nand s is the maximum integer such that \u03bds \u2264 n. If w is an interval on which\n(\u03bd1 , p1 ), (\u03bd2 , p2 ), . . . , (\u03bdj\u22121 , pj\u22121 ), is fixed and \u03bdj is the next return, then\n{x \u2208 w; p(f \u03bdj x) = p} has at most 4 components. This maximum is attained\nwhen |f \u03bdj (w)| \u2265 \u03b4, and the outmost intervals of length of \u01eb contain a critical\npoint and pj is big enough.\nNotice that the corresponding sequence (\u03bd1 , p1 ), (\u03bd2 , p2 ), . . . , (\u03bds , ps )\ncontains information about the iterations of f on w, although many sequences don't correspond to partition intervals. For a given sequence\n(\u03bd1 , p1 ), (\u03bd2 , p2 ), . . . , (\u03bds , ps ), let\nSd := {i \u2264 s; \u03bdi is a deep return} = {i \u2264 s; pi > 0},\n\nSs := {i \u2264 s; \u03bdi is a shallow return} = {i \u2264 s; pi = 0},\nSs,s := {i < s; pi = 0 and pi+1 = 0}.\n4.2.

Let w \u2208 P\u0302n , then f n (w) has reached large scale. By the construction\nof the induced map, there is an interval T \u2283 w such that f n (T ) is a \u01eb-scaled\nneighborhood of f n (w), i.e.,|f n (T ) \\ f n (w)| \u2265 \u01eb|f n (w)|. On the other hand,\nit is easy to see that f n is a diffeomorphism on T .

Let C = C( 2\u03b4 ) and \u03bb = \u03bb\u03b4/2 be as in Lemma 3, and K be constant in Lemma 2. There exist K0 > 0 independent of \u01eb and \u03c1 \u2208 (0, 1) with\nthe following properties. For a given sequence (\u03bd1 , p1 ), (\u03bd2 , p2 ) . . . , (\u03bds , ps )\nwith \u03bds \u2264 n, the corresponding interval wp1 p2 ,...,ps \u2208 P\u0302n , we have\nn\nP\nK0 \u266fSd \u266fSs,s o Y\n|wp1 p2 ,...,ps |\n\u2212\u266fSd \u2212\u03bb(m\u2212 si=0 pi )\ne\n,\n(\n) \u03c1\n\u2264\nmin\nC\n(DFpi )\u22121\n|f m (wp1 p2 ,...,ps )|\nK\ni\u2208Sd\n\nfor m = max{n, \u03bds + ps }.

The construction of the full markov map\nIn this Section we will construct a full Markov map f\u02c6 and give its estimates\nbased on the map F\u0302 : J\u02c6 \u2192 X constructed in previous section. Let J \u2208 X\nbe an arbitrary interval, P\u0302 be the corresponding partition constructed in\nSection 4.\nLemma 11. Let f \u2208 A1 . There exists an open interval \u03a9 around each\ncritical point c that is contained in a minimal cycle X, an integer t0 and a\nconstant \u03be > 0 such that for every w \u2208 P\u0302 , there exists an interval w\u0303 \u2282 w\nwith the following properties:\n(1) there exists an integer t \u2264 t0 such that f p\u0302(w)+t maps w\u0303 diffeomorphismlly onto \u03a9,\n(2) |w\u0303| \u2265 \u03be|w|,\n(3) both components of f p\u0302(w) (w \\ w\u0303) have length \u2265 \u03b4\u2032 /3.\nProof. By Theorem 1, the preimages of each critical point c \u2208 Cc are dense\n0\nin X. Then there exists a finite integer t0 > 1 such that X \\ \u222ati=0\nf \u2212i (c)\n\u2032\n\u2212t\ncontains no interval of length greater than \u03b4 . Let x := f (c) for some\n0 < t \u2264 t0 , we can choose wx be a maximal interval containing x such\nthat wx diffeomorphismly onto a neighborhood \u03a9 of c and x in wx middle\nfifth. By adjusting the size of wx , we can make sure that they all map\nonto exactly the same critical neighborhood \u03a9 and wx \u2264 \u03b4\u2032 /10. Let w\u0303 \u2282\nw \u2282 P\u0302 be the interval that is mapped onto wx by f p\u0302(w) , such a w\u0303 exists\nby Proposition 2. Then the first and the third statement follow. Because\nf p\u0302(w) has bounded distortion on w by Lemma 6, and the diffeomorphism\nf t (t \u2264 t0 ) doesn't effect the distortion significantly, the second statement\nfollows immediately.\n\u0003\nWe have fixed \u03a9 and let \u03b4\u2032\u2032 = min{\u03b4\u2032 /3, |\u03a9|}. We shall define a full Markov\nmap by the construction in Proposition 2 and Lemma 11.\nLet f\u02c6 : \u03a9 \u2192 \u03a9 be defined as follows, Q be the associated partition of \u03a9\nand R be the induced time function. For each element w in the partition\nP\u0302 of \u03a9, let w\u0303 denote the subinterval given in Lemma 11. We put w\u0303 into Q\nand define R(w\u0303) = p\u0302(w) + t. Then f\u02c6(w\u0303) = f R(w\u0303) (w\u0303) = \u03a9 by Lemma 11.\nOn the other hand, both components of f p\u0302(w) (w)\\f p\u0302(w) (w\u0303) has size at least\n\u03b4\u2032 /3 (\u2265 \u03b4\u2032\u2032 ), we consider them as new starting intervals and carry out the\nconstruction in Section 4 and repeat the procedure as above. In this way, for\neach w \u2208 Q, we can define an associated sequence before it has reached full\nreturn (i.e., \u2203n > 0, f n (w) = \u03a9), write p\u03021 = p\u0302(x) and p\u0302i+1 (x) = p\u0302(f p\u0302i (x) (x)),\n1 < i < s \u2212 1, where s is the integer such that f s maps corresponding\nelement containing x to reach full return. Then we have R(w) = p\u0302s (w) + t\nfor s \u2265 1, t \u2264 t0 .\nNext we collect some important results on the induced full Markov map\nand the return time estimates, they are important bounds used in Young\n[29].\nLemma 12. For each n \u2264 0 and each interval w \u2208 Q on which f\u02c6n is\ncontinuous, the distortion of f\u02c6n is uniformly bounded.\nProof. It follows from the construction of f\u02c6 immediately.\n\n\u0003\n\n\f18\n\nH. CUI\n\nLemma 13. Let f \u2208 A1 , f\u02c6 = f R be the induced full Markov map defined\nabove.

See the details of the proof of Proposition 4.1 in [4]\n\n\u0003\n\nFor x, y \u2208 Q, we let separation time s(x, y) \u2265 0 be the least integer k\nsuch that f\u02c6k (x) and f\u02c6k (y) belong to different elements of Q. So s(x, y) = 0\nif x, y are in different component of Q, and s(x, y) \u2265 1 if they belongs to\nthe same component of Q.\nLemma 14. There exist \u03b2 \u2208 (0, 1) and C > 0 such that for all w \u2208 Q and\nall x, y \u2208 w, we have\nD f\u02c6(x)\n|\n\u2212 1| \u2264 C\u03b2 s(x,y) .\n\u02c6\nD f (y)\nProof. See [4].\n\n\u0003\n6. Proof of Theorem 2 and Theorem 3\n\ni\nFor f \u2208 A1 , we focus on a minimal cycle of f . Let it be X = \u222am\u22121\ni=0 f (J),\nwhere m is the period of the minimal cycle X. In previous Section, we have\nconstructed an induced full Markov map f R(w) on a neighborhood \u03a9 of a\ncritical point c \u2208 J. Then denote g =: \u039b\u22121 \u25e6 f m \u25e6 \u039b be a renormalization\nof f , where \u039b is an affine transformation from interval M to J. We will\napply results of Young [29] to study the statistical properties of g stated in\nTheorem 2.\nFrom the definition of g, g induces a Markov map \u011c := \u039b\u22121 \u25e6 f\u02c6 \u25e6 \u039b on\nthe interval \u25b30 = \u039b\u22121 (\u03a9). Assume that the induced time of \u011c about g is\nT (w), clearly T (w) = R(w)/m.\nTo treat the statistical properties of g, we define a tower about g,\n\n\u02c6 = {(x, k) \u2208 \u25b30 \u00d7 Z; 0 \u2264 k \u2264 T (x)}\n\u25b3\n\n\u02c6 k = n}.

So we can get the statistical properties of g from the properties of \u011d.\n\u02c6 and\nTo study the structure of \u011d, we define \u03c0 be a projection between \u25b3\n\u25b30 by \u03c0(x, l) = x, clearly \u03c0\u011d = \u011c\u03c0. The powerful result of [29] relates the\ntower map \u011d and the full induced Markov map \u011c.\nWe summarize Young's result from [29] as we need.

Let \u03c6\u0302 = \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c3, then if x, y \u2208 \u25b30 with s(x, y) \u2265 1, we\nhave for 0 < k \u2264 T (x) = T (y)\n|\u03c6\u0302(x, k) \u2212 \u03c6\u0302(y, k)| = |\u03c6 \u25e6 g k (x) \u2212 \u03c6 \u25e6 g k (y)| \u2264 C|gk (x) \u2212 g k (y)|\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u2264 C|f\u02c6(x) \u2212 f\u02c6(y)| \u2264 C(\u03b2 \u03b1 )s(x,y) ,\n\nthus \u03b1-H\u00f6lder continuous observables on M correspond to observables in\nC\u03b21 for \u03b21 = \u03b2 \u03b1 , where \u03b2 is the constant in Lemma 14.\nR Since \u03bcR = \u03c3\u2217 \u03bd\u0302,R \u03c6\u0302 = \u03c6 \u25e6R\u03c3 and \u03c8\u0302 = \u03c8 \u25e6 \u03c3, we have the following relations\n\u03c6\u0302d\u03bd\u0302 = \u03c6d\u03bc, \u03c8\u0302d\u03bd\u0302 = \u03c8d\u03bc and\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nn\nn\n| (\u03c6 \u25e6 g )\u03c8d\u03bc \u2212 \u03c6d\u03bc \u03c8d\u03bc| = | (\u03c6\u0302 \u25e6 \u011d )\u03c8\u0302d\u03bd\u0302 \u2212 \u03c6\u0302d\u03bd\u0302 \u03c8\u0302d\u03bd\u0302|.\n\nThus the decay of correlations of g follows from the second statement of the\nYoung's Theorem.\nSimilarly, because\nZ\nZ\nn\u22121\nn\u22121\no\nn\no\nn\nX\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1 X\n\u02c6 \u221a1\n\u03c6(gj (x))\u2212 \u03c6d\u03bc \u2208 I = \u03bd\u0302 y \u2208 \u25b3;\n\u03c6\u0302(\u011dj (y))\u2212 \u03c6\u0302d\u03bd\u0302 \u2208 I ,\n\u03bc x \u2208 M; \u221a\nn\nn\nj=0\n\nj=0\n\napplying the third statement of Young's Theorem, we obtain the Central\nLimit Theorem for the H\u00f6lder continuous observable \u03c6. Therefore, we have\nfinished the proof of Theorem 2.\n\n\fSTATISTICAL PROPERTIES OF INTERVAL MAPS\n\n21\n\nFor f \u2208 A2 , we concentrated on the dynamics of (f, J \u2217 ). In previous\nsections, we have constructed an induced full Markov map f R(w) on a neighborhood \u03a9 of a critical point c \u2208 J \u2217 . Let k be the greatest common devisor\nof all values taken by the function R(w), then we can obtain Theorem 3 by\nusing Young's results and the above argument similarly.\nReferences\n[1] V.
