Introduction\nFeatures of the magnetic quantum oscillations\nof magnetization (de Haas-van Alphen effect) or\nof magnetoresistance (Shubnikov-de Haas effect)\nare known to be noticeably different in twodimensional (2D) metals from three-dimensional\n(3D) metals. For example, the 2D de Haas-van\nAlphen effect is characterized by a sharp sawtoothlike shape at low temperatures, while the oscillations of the magnetization in 3D metals are always\nsmooth. The difference between 2D and 3D metals\ncan be principally understood in terms of Landau\nlevels broadening.\nIn the 3D case, the Fermi energy is crossed by\nmany occupied Landau levels due to the presence\nof states in the direction parallel to the magnetic\nfield H. These non quantized states available for\nany amplitude of magnetic field act as a reservoir.\nThe discrete nature of the Landau levels is thus\nblurred by this broadening inherent to the dimensionality of the spectrum. As a result, the chemical\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Science\n\npotential \u03bc oscillates negligibly with the magnetic\nfield. Moreover, the oscillating part of the transport properties is always small compared to the\nnon-oscillating part. For example, in a metal with\na spherical Fermi surface, the oscillating part \u2206\u03c3\nof the conductivity \u03c3 is of the order of [1]\n\u0012 \u00132\nr\n\u2206\u03c3\n\u2202Mosc\n\u03c9c\n\u03c9c\n\u223c\n\u223c\n\u226a 1,\n(1)\n\u03c3\n\u03bc\n\u2202H\n\u03bc\nwhere \u03c9c is the cyclotron pulsation, and Mosc is\nthe oscillating part of magnetization.\nIn the 2D case, there is no Landau levels broadening due to dimensionality, and thus the oscillations of the thermodynamic and transport properties can be very strong. The principal source of\nLandau level broadening is henceforth the presence\nof impurities in real materials. In 3D metals, the\nimpurity broadening is an accessory ingredient in\nthe derivation of theory of magnetic quantum oscillations, and is usually taken into account by hand\nby introducing in the lth harmonic amplitude of\nthe oscillations the so-called Dingle factor\n31 October 2018\n\n\fexp(\u22122\u03c0l\u03930 /\u03c9c )\n\na crossover between the 2D and 3D limits for the\nbehavior of the magnetization oscillations.\nIt was with the same idea of a reduced dimensionality driven by the ratio t/\u03c9c that we studied the magnetoresistance oscillations in quasi-2D\nmetals [7]. The regime t \u2265 \u03c9c has been investigated\nin details in Ref. [8] and in references therein. Here,\nwe are rather interested in the 2D limit t \u226a \u03c9c ,\nmotivated by the experiments of Wosnitza et al. [9]\nand Nam et al. [10] on the organic layered conductor \u03b2 \u2032\u2032 \u2212(BEDT \u2212 TTF)2 SF5 CH2 CF2 SO3 . Giant Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations of the longitudinal magnetoresistance \u03c1zz were observed at high\nmagnetic fields and low temperatures. In particular, a regime with a thermally activated behavior\nof the minima of the magnetoconductivity \u03c3zz =\n\u03c1\u22121\nzz has been pointed out for magnetic fields higher\nthan 20 T [10]. Such a feature is completely absent\nin the 3D Shubnikov-de Haas theory.\nStrong oscillations of \u03c1zz were also reported in\nthe organic conductor \u03b1\u2212(ET)2 TlHg(SeCN)4 [11].\nThe observation of slow oscillations of the magnetoresistance in a field region [11] implies that the\nsituation in this compound is presumably intermediate between the two regimes t \u2265 \u03c9c [8] and t \u226a\n\u03c9c [7].\nAs mentioned previously, the 2D limit in quasi2D metals is problematic concerning the theoretical treatment of the impurities effects. Being aware\nof this weakness, only qualitative properties based\non general theoretical considerations (i.e. without\nmaking specific assumptions about the form of the\nimpurity self-energy) are expected to be reasonable\nat this stage.\nThe relevance of the 2D limit in the conductor \u03b2 \u2032\u2032 \u2212(BEDT \u2212 TTF)2 SF5 CH2 CF2 SO3 is indicated by the sawtooth shape of the de Haas-van\nAlphen signal already observed for fields H \u2265 10\nT [12]. Moreover, the magnetization ocillations [12]\nare also consistent with negligibly small chemical\npotential oscillations in this compound. The reason for this is still unclear. An explanation may be\nthe presence of an intrinsic non-quantized reservoir\nformed by quasi-1D bands. We note that another\nmechanism for reducing the chemical potential oscillations may be the magnetostriction. Indeed, the\nvolume of the sample is not fixed in the conditions of experiments and thus is expected to vary\nwith the variation of magnetization. The changes\nin the chemical potential associated with the oscillations of the density of states and with the magnetostriction might be cancelled under particular\nconditions [13].\nIn the following sections, we derive first the form\nof \u03c3zz in the 2D limit for a point-like impurity scat-\n\nwith \u03930 the zero field value of the imaginary part of\nthe impurity self-energy. Such a factor has received\na microscopic justification in Ref. [2]. On the other\nhand, the consideration of impurities effects on the\nmagnetic quantum oscillations is of the first importance in the theory of magnetic quantum oscillations in 2D metals. The broadening due to pointlike impurities is usually investigated in the socalled self-consistent Born approximation (SCBA)\nwhich leads to oscillations of the imaginary part\nof the energy-dependent impurity self-energy \u0393(\u03b5).\nIn high magnetic fields, the oscillations of \u0393(\u03b5) become very strong. In such a regime, the mere consideration of point-like impurities has been shown\nto be inappropriate to describe correctly the magnetic quantum oscillations [3,4]. To our knowledge,\nthe complete and satisfactory theory of the impurities effects on magnetic quantum oscillations, i.e.\nof the lifting of the degeneracy of the Landau levels\ndue to impurities, still does not exist.\nAnother problem which arises in 2D metals\nis the presence of nonnegligible chemical potential oscillations when the system is isolated. Actually, the influence of oscillations of \u03bc on the\nshape of the magnetization oscillations or magnetoresistivity oscillations can be investigated at\na semi-phenomenological level (by bypassing the\nmicroscopic problem with the impurities which\ndetermines the exact dependence of the chemical\npotential with the magnetic field) and makes no\nimportant difficulty [5].\nIn quasi-2D metals with the magnetic field perpendicular to the layers, the energy spectrum has\nthe form\n\u03b5n (pz ) = (n + 1/2)\u03c9c \u2212 2t cos pz s\n\n(2)\n\nwith pz the interlayer momentum, t the interlayer\ntransfer integral and s the interlayer distance. The\nsituation concerning the Landau levels broadening is in some sense intermediate between the 2D\nand 3D cases and depends on the ratio t/\u03c9c : the\nLandau levels broadening due to dimensionality\nis strongly effective when t \u226b \u03c9c . In the opposite\nlimit, when t \u226a \u03c9c , the Landau levels are broadened only through the impurities effects, exactly\nlike in 2D metals. It is worth noting that the\n3D de Haas-van Alphen and Shubnikov-de Haas\ntheories are not directly applicable to quasi-2D\nmetals because the saddle-point method used in\nthe calculations of the 3D case [1] breaks down\nwith the spectrum (2) when \u03c9c \u2265 t. The (semiphenomenological) theory of the de Haas-van\nAlphen effect in quasi-2D metals [6] has revealed\n2\n\n\ftering with an arbitrary impurity self-energy. The\nmechanism of appearance of the thermal activation\nof conductivity minima is pointed out. Then, assuming a specific form for the impurity self-energy,\nwe have performed a numerical analysis of the temperature and magnetic field dependences of \u03c1zz oscillations to compare with experiments [9,10].\n\n30\n\n0\n\n0\n\ns/(s c )\n\n20\n\n10\n\n2.

Maxima of magnetoresistivity\nIf the chemical potential oscillations are negligibly small, the main means of conduction between\nthe Landau levels at a finite low temperature is\nthe thermal excitation at the edges of the gap-like\nrange \u2206.

Concluding remarks\n120\n\nOur model considering only short-range impurity scattering and the spectrum (2) therefore\naccounts for the thermal activation of \u03c3zz minima\nin presence of negligibly small chemical potential\noscillations, as observed in the layered conductor\n\u03b2 \u2032\u2032 \u2212(BEDT \u2212 TTF)2 SF5 CH2 CF2 SO3 . However,\nthere remain some qualitative features in experiments [9,10] not explained by our theoretical\nmodel, such as the increase of \u03c1zz minima with\nthe magnetic field at high magnetic fields and low\ntemperatures. It is worth noting that under these\nlatter conditions, the Landau levels broadening\ndue to point-like impurity scattering alone is probably ineffective. Landau levels broadening due to\nimpurity scattering on finite range becomes predominant and has to be envisaged as being physically relevant for seizing the complete behavior of\n\u03c1zz oscillations.\n\n60\n\nzz\n\nr /r\n\n0\n\n90\n\n30\n\n0\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nMagnetic Field (T)\n\nFig.\n2.\nOscillations\nof\nthe\nmagnetoresistance\n\u03c1zz /\u03c10 = \u03c30 /\u03c3zz as a function of magnetic field for different temperatures (from the top, 0.59, 0.94, 1.48, 1.58,\n1.91, 2.18, 2.68, 3.03, 3.38, 3.80, and 4.00 K).\n\nIf the thermally activated behavior can be\npointed out by qualitative arguments, i.e. without invoking a specific model for \u0393(\u03b5), the study\nat a quantitative level needs specific assumptions\nconcerning the impurity self-energy. As declared\nin introduction, such investigation has to be done\nwith care, since the theory in the 2D limit does\nnot exist yet.\nSince the chemical potential may be fixed in\n\u03b2 \u2032\u2032 \u2212(BEDT \u2212 TTF)2 SF5 CH2 CF2 SO3 by a finite\nreservoir formed by a quasi-1D band [12], we proposed [7] to include this reservoir in the calculations of \u0393(\u03b5) within a model of short-range impurity scattering. Using the SCBA, we obtained the\nself-consistent equation [7]\n\n\u03c7(\u03b5) =\n\n\uf8ee\n\nReferences\n[1] A.A.

For R = 0 (no\nreservoir) and \u03c70 \u2264 2, this equation leads to the\nabsence of states between the Landau levels. This\nunphysical result [3,4] is avoided as soon as R 6=\n0. Assuming the value R = 5 necessary for suppressing significantly the chemical potential oscillations [12], we found [7] that the oscillations of\n\u03c7(\u03b5) are of the order of 10 % for H = 60 T, and thus\nneglected them in our numerical calculation [7] (i.e.\nwe took \u03c7(\u03b5) \u2248 \u03c70 ). In Fig. 2, we show the oscillations of \u03c1zz at different temperatures. The thermal activation of \u03c1zz maxima is well reproduced\nnumerically for fields H \u2265 20 T.\n\n[10] M.-S.
