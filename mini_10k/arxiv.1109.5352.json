We select only face-on spiral galaxies in order to avoid contamination\nby light from the disk in the SDSS fiber and enabling the robust visual identification\nof spiral structure. Overall, we find that galaxies with larger central stellar velocity\ndispersions, regardless of morphological type, have older ages, higher metallicities, and\nan increased overabundance of alpha-elements. Age and alpha-enhancement, at fixed\nvelocity dispersion, do not depend on morphological type. The only parameter that,\nat a given velocity dispersion, correlates with morphological type is metallicity, where\nthe metallicity of the bulges of spiral galaxies is 0.07 dex higher than that of the\nellipticals. However, for galaxies with a given total stellar mass, this dependence on\nmorphology disappears. Under the assumption that, for our sample, the velocity dispersion traces the mass of the bulge alone, as opposed to the total mass (bulge+disk)\nof the galaxy, our results imply that the formation epoch of galaxy and the duration of\nits star-forming period are linked to the mass of the bulge. The extent to which metals\nare retained within the galaxy, and not removed as a result of outflows, is determined\nby the total mass of the galaxy.\nKey words: galaxies:\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nGalaxies in the local Universe come, broadly speaking, in\ntwo flavors: objects with blue and red optical colors tend\nto inhabit different regions of the color-magnitude diagram (CMD, Strateva et al., 2001), with blue galaxies showing a large spread in color and red galaxies following a\nrelatively tight sequence. This so-called red sequence has\nbeen observed up to z \u2243 2 and has grown in mass by\na factor of \u223c 2 since z = 1, although the evolution in\nthe massive end of the distribution remains controversial\n(Heavens et al., 2004; Bell et al., 2004; Cimatti et al., 2006;\nFaber et al., 2007; Robaina et al., 2010). As galaxies with\nred stellar populations typically show low levels of star for-\n\nmation1 (SF), the mechanism needed to add stellar mass\nto the red sequence must imply the migration of a certain\nnumber of objects from the blue cloud to the red sequence\n(Brinchmann & Ellis, 2000; Bell et al., 2007; Walcher et al.,\n2008) by quenching of their star formation.\nWhile galaxies on the blue cloud show predominantly disk-like light profiles, the red sequence is dominated by objects with more concentrated light distributions (Blanton et al., 2003). Further evidence on the relation between SF quenching and galaxy structure is provided by Bell (2008), who found that red and dead stellar populations tend to inhabit galaxies with concentrated\n\n1\n\n\u22c6\n\nc\n\nE-mail:arobaina@icc.ub.edu (ARR)\nRAS\n\nA fraction of galaxies in the red sequence at all redshifts is\nred because of dust-obscuration rather than truly red and dead\npopulations. This fraction decreases towards both lower redshift\nand high stellar mass.\n\n\f2\n\nAday R. Robaina et al.\n\nlight profiles. Detailed studies of the shape of quiescent\ngalaxies show that spheroidal systems are overwhelmingly\ndominant at masses larger than 1 \u2212 2 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 , but a\nlarge contribution of red disks is observed below that critical mass (van der Wel et al., 2009; Masters et al., 2010), in\ngood agreement with the results by Bundy et al. (2010) on\nthe migration of disk galaxies to the red sequence. More recently, Holden et al. (2011) report that at all redshifts z < 1\nthe relative fraction of disk and early-type galaxies added\nto the red sequence at a given stellar mass is approximately\nconstant. Taking all these previous results together, it is\nclear that SF quenching in disk galaxies without the need\nof dramatic morphological perturbations is a valid and frequent mechanism \u2013although not dominant\u2013 to move galaxies\nfrom the blue cloud to the red sequence.\nFor this reason, red disk galaxies have drawn the attention of the extragalactic community. In the late 70's,\nvan den Bergh (1976) reported the existence of passive\ngalaxies with spiral morphology in the Virgo Cluster,\nand later studies confirmed the existence of a population of quiescent disk galaxies in dense environments (i.e.,\nPoggianti et al., 1999). More recently Wolf et al. (2009)\nshow that in intermediate-mass cluster environment red spiral galaxies are equivalent to the actively star-forming blue\nspirals, but with lower SF and a higher fraction of dustobscuration. These galaxies also tend to display stronger bar\nfeatures than their blue counterparts (Hoyle et al., 2011a).\nA hint on the origin of these systems is provided also by\nBamford et al. (2009) and Skibba et al. (2009), who found\nby using visually classified SDSS galaxies from Galaxy Zoo\n(GZ) that the relation between optical color and environment is more significant than the well known morphologydensity relation Dressler (1980).\nDecades of studies have shaped a solid knowledge of the\nstellar populations of red-sequence galaxies. These galaxies follow several tight scaling relations linking their stellar population properties to their mass and their dynamical and structural properties, such as the color-magnitude\nrelation (Faber, 1973; Gonzalez et a., 1993), the relation\nbetween absorption index strengths and velocity dispersion (Bender et al., 1993; Kelson et al., 2006; Chang et al.,\n2006) and the Fundamental Plane (Djorgovski & Davis,\n1987; Bernardi et al., 2003). The physical drive of these relations is an increase in all of metallicty, element abundance\nratios and stellar age with galaxy mass or velocity dispersion\n(Trager et al., 2000; Kuntschner et al., 2001; Thomas et al.,\n2005; Gallazzi et al., 2006; Tojeiro & Percival, 2010). Indeed, stellar population properties seem to be more fundamentally correlated with stellar velocity dispersion than\nwith galaxy mass (Graves et al., 2009). The picture that\nemerges is that present-day elliptical galaxies with deeper\npotential wells have reached a higher degree of chemical enrichment and have formed their stars at earlier epochs and\non shorter timescales. Moreover, the small intrinsic scatter in the observed scaling relations is associated primarily with variations in stellar age and, to a lesser degree, in\nchemical abundances, putting additional constraints on the\nvariety of SFHs that present-day elliptical galaxies of similar mass have undergone (e.g. Jimenez et al., 2005, 2007;\nGallazzi et al., 2006; Graves et al., 2010).\nAn additional parameter that influences the SFH, hence\nthe stellar populations, of elliptical galaxies is their en-\n\nvironment. While the slope of the scaling relations is independent of the environment, small variations in their\nzero-point and scatter have been observed, indicating both\nthat the fraction of galaxies with younger stellar populations (\"rejuvenated\") increases in low density environments (Thomas et al., 2010) and that at fixed mass galaxies in denser environments tend to be older than their\nlow-density couterparts (Cooper et al., 2010; Clemens et al.,\n2006; Hoyle et al., 2011b).\nOn the other hand relatively few works (see e.g. Proctor&Sansom 2002, Thomas&Davies 2006, Kuntschner et al\n2010, Falcon-Barroso et al 2011) have analysed the stellar populations and scaling relations of different morphological types, in particular among red-sequence galaxies.\nThomas&Davies 2006 reanalysed the sample of spiral bulges\n(from Sa to Sbc) of Proctor&Sansom 2002 and found that\nthe bulges of spiral galaxies have similar stellar populations\nto elliptical galaxies at fixed velocity dispersion. Early-type\nspiral galaxies also seem to follow the same Fundamental Plane as ellipticals, albeit with larger scatter (FalconBarroso et al 2011).\nHowever these works generally do not distinguish galaxies on the basis of their star formation activity. In this work\nwe are specifically interested in comparing the stellar populations of galaxies that are quiescent but differ in morphology, namely quiescent spirals against elliptical galaxies.\nMasters et al. (2010) primary focus was in the characterization of red spirals and the comparison with blue spirals,\nbut a detailed comparison of the stellar populations in quiescent spiral and early-type galaxies could shed some light\non the processes by which they are formed and subsequently\nquenched. In particular, given the differences found between\nred and blue spirals in Masters et al. (2010), it would be\nextremely important to learn whether the stars in spiral\ngalaxies can follow an evolutionary path similar to those\nin spheroidal systems even when the morphological evolution of their host galaxies is dramatically different, as that\nwould put constraints on the mechanisms driving the star\nformation histories of passive galaxies in the Universe.\nIn this paper, we study the stellar populations in the\ncentral regions of a sample of truly passive spiral galaxies at\nz<\n\u223c 0.1 from SDSS and compare them to those in quiescent\nellipticals. We choose to do so by comparing the ages, total\nmetallicities ([Z/H]) and, in particular, the \u03b1\u2212enhancement\nof their populations. In order to assemble a statistically\nsignificant galaxy sample we use data products from the\nNYU-VAC (Blanton et al., 2003) and visual morphology estimates from the Galaxy Zoo project (Lintott et al., 2008,\n2011). We also model the stellar populations in SDSS DR7\nquiescent galaxies, following the method described in Gallazzi et al. (2005, 2006)(hereafter G05 and G06 respectively),\nto obtain stellar masses, r-band weighted ages, [Z/H] and\n\u2206Mgb/hFei \u2013a tracer of the \u03b1-enhancement. We end up\nwith a sample of \u223c1000 quiescent spiral and \u223c14700 passive early-type galaxies.\nThis paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we describe the sample selection and the parameters we use to\ncharacterize the stellar populations. In Section 3 we present\nour results and discuss possible evolutionary paths. Finally,\nin Section 4, we present our conclusions.\nThroughout this paper we use \u03a9m0 =0.3, \u03a9\u039b0 =0.7 and\nh100 =0.7. All magnitudes are in the AB photometric system.\nc\n\nRAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u2013??\n\n\fThe simlar stellar populations of quiescent spiral and elliptical galaxies\n2\n\nSAMPLE SELECTION AND METHOD\n\nGalaxies are drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\nData Release 7 SDSS DR7, Abazajian et al., 2009. In particular, we make use of the publicly available New York\nUniversity-Value Added Catalog (NYU-VAC) released by\nBlanton et al. (2005). We select galaxies in the redshift\nrange 0.04 < z < 0.1 and masses log M\u2217 > 10.4M\u2299 .\nThe magnitude limit in the SDSS spectroscopy places the\nlower mass limit for red galaxies at z \u223c 0.1 approximately\nat logM\u2217 = 10.6M\u2299 , although we choose to work with\ngalaxies slightly below that limit. Nonetheless, we warn the\nreader that our sample is incomplete by \u223c20% below log\nM\u2217 = 10.6M\u2299 at the highest redshift probed here. We make\nuse of NYU-VAC k-corrected photometry, spectroscopic redshifts and light-profile fitting parameters in the r band.\nStellar masses, metallicities and r-band light-weighted\nages for SDSS DR7 galaxies have been estimated in the\nsame way as for previous releases and as described in\nG05, to which we refer the reader for a full description.\nBriefly, estimates of the stellar population parameters are\nobtained by comparing the observed stellar absorption features (corrected for emission lines) with those predicted\nby a comprehensive library of model spectra based on\nBruzual & Charlot (2003) SSPs convolved with Monte Carlo\nstar formation histories. A comparison between the new\nSDSS DR7 parameters and those of SDSS DR4 from G05\nand G06 provides no systematic offset and a typical dispersion at the level of \u223c 0.1 dex in light-weighted age, stellar\nmass and metallicity for galaxies with red, quiescent stellar populations, well below the typical error budget in those\nmeasurements. In this work we correct the estimated galaxy\nages to z=0 by adding the lookback time at the redshift of\nthe galaxy under the assumption of passive evolution (which\nis very reasonable for our sample of quiescent galaxies).\nIn addition to the aforementioned stellar population parameters we focus on the \u03b1\u2212enhancement. In spite of the\nname, the effect is more a lack of iron rather than an excess\nof \u03b1\u2212elements. This lack of iron is produced when the SF\ntimescale of a galaxy is short. Core-collapse supernovae enrich the medium with \u03b1-elements in scales of a few tenths of\nMyrs, while the Fe-enrichment is due to type Ia supernovae\nexplosions. If a significant fraction of the stars are formed in\na period shorter than the \u223c 1 Gyr needed by type Ia supernovae progenitors to evolve, the stars would show a chemical\ncomposition with higher \u03b1/Fe abundance ratios than those\nin stellar populations formed with longer timescales.\nAs a tracer of the \u03b1-enhancement in the stellar populations of our sample we use the semi-empirical [alpha/Fe]\nindicator adopted by G06, namely \u2206(Mgb/hFei) which is\nthe difference between the observed Mgb/hFei absorption\nindex2 and that of the scaled-solar BC03 model that best\nfits [\u03b1/Fe]-independent features. G06 have tested, through\ncomparison with Thomas et al. (2003) models with variable abundance ratios, that \u2206(Mgb/hFei)) correlates linearly with the abundance ratio [\u03b1/Fe] independently of age\nand metallicity (except for metallicities below 30 percent\nsolar, which is lower than the range covered by our sample). In particular, we confirm such proportionality over the\nmetallicity and age range spanned by our sample (0.5 <\n2\n\nc\n\nh Fe i is the average of the Fe5270 and Fe5335 index strengths\nRAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u2013??\n\n3\n\nZ/Z\u2299 < 2 and age older than 3 Gyr) with the differential models presented in Walcher et al. (2009) based on the\ntheoretical Coelho et al. (2007) models calibrated onto either BC03 or Vazdekis et al. (2010). We stress that the values of \u2206(Mgb/hFei) should not be directly translated into\nvalues of [\u03b1/Fe], i.e. the proportionality constant between\n\u2206(Mgb/hFei) and [\u03b1/Fe] is not 1 and is likely model dependent.\n\n2.1\n\nQuiescent stellar populations\n\nAs we want to compare spiral and elliptical galaxies with quiescent stellar populations,\u2013 and specifically not galaxies reddened by dust obscuration\u2013, we select galaxies without H\u03b1\nemission from their spectra. Nonetheless, two effects can endanger the reliability of this selection: a) large levels of dust\nobscuration might cause the absence of H\u03b1 detections even\nin the presence of star formation, and b) the 3\u2032\u2032 diameter of\nthe SDSS fiber might not be large enough, in many cases,\nto sample a representative fraction of the stellar populations\npresent in the galaxy. This would be specially concerning in\nthe case of galaxies with quiescent bulges and star forming\ndisks. These problems might be alliviated by the inclusion\nof an additional criterion. It has been shown that galaxies\ndominated by passive (i.e., non-star-forming) populations\ntend to be found in a particular region of a color-color plot\nin which one of the colors bracket the 4000\u00c5 break and the\nother falls redwards of that spectral feature (Williams et al.,\n2009; Holden et al., 2011)3 . In such a diagram red-passive\nand red-obscured galaxies are distinguished by the different\nimprint imposed by age and dust on the galaxy's spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We show the SDSS derived u \u2212 r\ncolor vs r \u2212 z color diagram of the galaxy sample in Fig. 1.\nFrom the comparison between both panels, it is clear that\nelliptical and spiral galaxies without H\u03b1 emission present a\ndifferent distribution. More than 90% of elliptical galaxies lie\non the region of the diagram where quiescent stellar populations cluster while spirals present a larger dispersion, both\ntowards bluer u \u2212 r color, probably indicating different stellar populations in the centre and outskirts of the galaxy, and\ntowards redder r \u2212 z values, implying larger levels of obscuration by dust. Therefore, we decide to use for the present\nstudy only those galaxies without noticiable H\u03b1 emission\nand quiescent stellar populations over the whole galaxy by\nselecting them in the u\u2212r vs r\u2212z diagram. The green line in\nboth panels of Fig. 1 shows the selection box used here. We\nhave been very conservative in the definition of the boundaries between star-forming and non-star-forming. If we were\nto select galaxies at \u223c 1\u03c3 from the center of the quiescent\nclump, we would include several massive spiral galaxies with\nresidual levels of star formation, detected at different colors\nin the disk and bulge in a visual inspection. The reason is\nthat the galaxies in our sample span more than 1 dex in\nstellar mass, and the boundary between blue cloud and red\nsequence is mass- (or magnitude-) dependent. Then, we decide to include galaxies 0.04 mag redder in u \u2212 r than the 1\u03c3\n3\n\nA similar method but using a combination of optical and UV\ncolors has been succesfully applied to the selection of red, old,\ndisk galaxies by Wolf et al.

This shift is arbitrary, but help us to make sure\nthat the galaxies we study are, indeed, quiescent.\nOur sample selection differs from that in previous studies making use of Galaxy Zoo data (Masters et al., 2010) in\nthe sense that we do not only select by optical color, but\nspecifically reject any galaxy with hints of recent star formation.\n2.2\n\nellitpical galaxies. In order to identify these particular morphological types we use visual classifications released by\nthe Galaxy Zoo (GZ) collaboration (Lintott et al., 2008,\n2011). Initally, we select galaxies with a debiased probability Pdebiased > 0.8 (Bamford et al., 2009) of being either\nspiral or elliptical (spiral arms or the presence of and edgeon disk is required in the GZ classification in order to assign\na galaxy to the category of spiral). However, there are some\nrelevant caveats one should take into account when using\nthis catalog: a) quiescent galaxies have red optical colors\nand a higher M/L ratio than star forming galaxies; implying that for galaxies at the same mass, it is intrinsically more\ndifficult to classify a red galaxy than a blue one, b) quiescent\nspiral galaxies usually lack the strong structure present in\nstar forming spirals. This makes it even harder to recognize\nspiral patterns4 , and c) the definition of \"Combined Spiral\"\nused in GZ catalog includes both face-on disk galaxies with\nobvious spiral arms and edge-on disks for which the spiral\nstructure is not detectable even when present. The higher\nthe redshift and the lower the stellar mass, the harder it is\nto clearly identify the spiral structure in a disk galaxy, even\nwhen present. All those problems could lead to a relatively\nhigh number of potential missclassifications, which are partially corrected for when calculating the debiased probability\n(see Bamford et al., 2009, for further details). Nonetheless,\nas we show in Fig. 3, there is a clear bias present when studying quiescent galaxies. For a complete sample of spirals the\nprojected axis ratio distribution should be approximately\nflat at values larger than the intrinsic thickness. We check for\nthis by plotting the axis ratio (b/a) vs. galaxy stellar mass\nof the GZ-selected spirals with quiescent stellar populations.\nTruly face-on disk galaxies would fall close b/a = 1, while\nthose seen edge-on would appear somewhere in the range\n0.1 < b/a < 0.5 (depending on the intrinsic thickness of the\ndisk and bulge contribution). Alternatively, in the absence\nof any bias the distribution with b/a should be homogeneus\nat all masses. Instead we observe a deficit of low-inclination\nspirals at low masses. In order to guarantee the homogeneity of the spiral galaxy sample, we use only low-inclination\ngalaxies (b/a > 0.5). While this does not guarantee that we\nare complete down to our mass limit of logM\u2217 = 10.4, we\ncan be sure that the morphological selection is homogeneus\nby including in the sample only those spiral galaxies with\nvisible arms.\nIn the present work, we follow the Galaxy Zoo nomenclature, this is, we call 'ellipticals' those galaxies which have\na probability of being elliptical >0.8. However, this category\nincludes many galaxies with B/T ratios lower than those of\npurely bulge-dominated objects and potentially, some misclassified face-on, smooth disks.\nLarge, massive, low-inclination spiral galaxies would be\nmore likely to get an accurate classification than small, low\nmass counterparts. This is a matter of concern because potential systematic differences in the sizes and spiral structure\nof low- and high-inclination disk galaxies could jeopardize a\nproper comparison: the 3\u2032\u2032 diameter of SDSS spectrograph\nfiber would sample systematically different physical radii in\ngalaxies observed under different angles.\n\nSystematic error checks\n\nThe main aim of this work is to perform a differential analysis between the stellar populations of quiescent spiral and\n\n4\n\nBoth Masters et al. (2010) and the present study use galaxies\nwith visible spiral patterns\nc\n\nRAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u2013??\n\n\fThe simlar stellar populations of quiescent spiral and elliptical galaxies\n\nFigure 3. Axis ratio (r-band) vs galaxy stellar mass for our quiescent spiral galaxies as classified in Galaxy Zoo (PCS > 0.8).\nThe majority of relatively low inclination (b/a > 0.5), lower mass\nquiescent spirals are not confidently assigned to the \"spiral\" category in the Galaxy Zoo catalogue.\n\nby Proctor & Sansom (2002); Thomas & Davies (2006), but\ngiven the degeneracy between bulge-to-total ratio (B/T),\nphysical size and angular distance evolution and the fixed\nsize of the SDSS spectrograph fibre we will be probing the\nstellar populations in the central regions, that are indeed\ndominated by the bulge. Given the typical high sersic index\nof quiescent spirals, it is very likely that the light within\nRe is dominated by a prominent bulge. Nonetheless, we can\nnot discard some contribution from stellar populations in\nthe inner disk, although we deem it to be a second-order effect since we specifically select galaxies with quiescent stellar\npopulations all over the galaxy. We will also test our main\nresults for a subsample of galaxies for which we know the\nlight in the fiber to be bulge-dominated.\nWhile we focus in the comparison between elliptical and\nface-on spiral galaxies, we will also show in some of our plots\na third group of galaxies, composed of edge-on quiescent\ndisks selected from the NYU-VAC to have b/a < 0.4 \u2013and\nno constraint in GZ visual classification. When comparing\nthis with the two aforementioned samples (edge- and faceon quiescent disks), the reader should bear in mind that\nin many cases the amount of light originated by the disks'\nstellar populations in edge-on objects will be larger than in\nthe case of the GZ face-on quiescent spiral sample.\nAs a summary of our sample selection, we use SDSS\nDR7 galaxies at 0.04 < z < 0.1 with logM\u2217 /M\u2299 > 10.4.\nObjects are selected to show optical u \u2212 r color compatible\nwith red sequence galaxies, no H\u03b1 emission in the spectra.\nAdditionally we select them photometrically to be quiescent in the u \u2212 r vs r \u2212 z diagram following Williams et al.\n(2009) and Holden et al. (2011). All objects must have debiased probability P > 0.8 of being either spiral or elliptical in\nthe Galaxy Zoo catalog. Furthermore, we include only those\nspiral galaxies with low ellipticity (b/a > 0.5). We will show\nfor comparison purposes edge-on quiescent disk galaxies selected from the NYU-VAC to have b/a < 0.4. This leaves\nus with a sample of approximately 14700 early type galaxies\nand 1000 face-on spirals.\n\n3\nFigure 4. Sersic index distribution of quiescent elliptical, quiescent spiral and all spiral galaxies in the DR7 spectroscopic catalog. Only galaxies with debiased probability Pdebiased > 0.8 are\nselected in all three cases. Quiescent spiral galaxies show a distribution closer to that of early types than that of 'normal' spirals.\n\nWe show the Sersic index distributions of quiescent ellipticals, quiescent spirals and all the spirals in our catalog,\nselected by a debiased probability Pdebiased > 0.8 of having\nthe respective morphological type in Fig. 4. Notably, quiescent spiral galaxies present a different Sersic distribution\nthan star-forming spiral galaxies \u2013dominated by blue disks\u2013,\npeaking at n \u2243 4 instead of lower value of n \u223c 1.5 \u2212 2 of\nblue spirals. This is indicative of the presence of large bulges\nin these objects. We note that introducing a further cut in\nn to select elliptical galaxies (i. e., selecting only elliptical\ngalaxies with n > 3) makes no difference to our final results.\nIdeally, we would compare the stellar populations in\nthe bulges of spiral and elliptical galaxies, as in the works\nc\n\nRAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u2013??\n\n5\n\nRESULTS\n\nIn this paper, we perform a differential analysis of the stellar\npopulations in the central regions of quiescent spiral and\nelliptical galaxies. We compare, in particular, the metallicity,\n\u03b1\u2212enhancement (traced by the excess of Mgb/hFei) and rband light-weighted age of those two groups of galaxies over\nthe redshift range 0.04 < z < 0.1 and with stellar masses\nlog(M\u2217 /M\u2299 ) > 10.4.\nIn Fig. 5 we show the median values of those quantities in bins of stellar mass. The metallicity in all three subsamples is remarkably similar over the whole mass range\nexplored in this paper. They are not only compatible within\nthe 1\u03c3 typical dispersion, shown as the large error bar on\nthe right side of the plot, but also the position of the mean\nof both distributions are indistinguishable. The error in the\nposition of the mean is denoted by the error in every mass\nbin.\nWhile the fact that massive elliptical galaxies are \u03b1\u2212enhanced is well stablished in the literature (Worthey et al., 1992; Thomas et al., 2003, 2005;\nGallazzi et al., 2006), we find at very high statistical signif-\n\n\f6\n\nAday R.

Middle panel: Excess of\nMgb over Fe with respect to BC03 models. The \u03b1-enhancement\nis very similar in the two populations. There is a small shift in\nthe \u2206(Mgb /hFei) present in quiescent spirals with respect to ellipticals. The two groups are largely overlapping, as shown by the\n1\u03c3 error bar on the right, which represents the dispersion in the\ndistribution. Bottom panel: r-band light-weighted age vs stellar\nmass. Again, quiescent spiral and elliptical galaxies are very similar, with a very weak trend of spirals showing slightly younger\nstellar populations. The large error bar in all three panels shows\nthe typical 1\u03c3 dispersion.\n\nicance, that at all masses, the central regions of quiescent\nspiral galaxies also show an important excess of \u03b1\u2212elements\nwith respect to Fe, and follow a trend with mass similar\nto that of the ellipticals. Both populations are largely\noverlapping, but in this case, the position of the mean\nseems to be shifted down by \u223c 0.1. Light-weighted ages of\nquiescent spirals seem to be, on average, 400 Myrs younger\nthan those of ellipticals. Nonetheless, errors in the measurements, modelling and derivation of parameters could\nadd-up an error similar to such a small difference. If we\nare conservative and assume that the typical observational\nerror in Mgb/hFei always work in the direction of increasing\nthe recovered enhancement (i.e., if we consider only as true\nenhanced those galaxies with \u2206(Mgb/hFei)>0.2), we can\nmake sure that the bulk of elliptical galaxies at all the\nmasses probed here possesses, indeed, a super solar \u03b1/Fe\nratio. Quiescent spiral galaxies above 1010.6 M\u2299 are also\ninequivocally \u03b1-enhanced.\nThe total stellar mass of a galaxy is a good tracer of\nits properties, but as we study the stellar populations in\nthe central regions of the object, we perform a similar exercise in Fig. 6, except that this time we show the metallicity,\n\u03b1\u2212enhancement and age of the stellar populations as a function of the measured velocity dispersion (\u03c3v ) in the central\nregion of the galaxy.\nVelocity dispersion is not completely free from the influence of the mass distribution of the galaxy in the outer\nregions \u2013i.e., outside the fiber coverage\u2013, but has the advantages of being a direct measurement of the dynamical\nproperties in the region of the galaxy under study and\n\nFigure 6. Stellar population properties as a function of the central \u03c3v .Lines and error bars are as in Fig. 5.\n\nFigure 7. Stellar population properties as a function of total\nstellar mass, in bins of velocity dispersion. Trends with stellar\nmass are almost nonexistent, in comparison with 5, implying that\nthe central velocity dispersion (a good proxy for the bulge's mass)\nand not total stellar mass is the observable with the strongest\ncorrelation with stellar population parameters.\n\nalso less uncertainties related to modelling than total stellar mass. Nonetheless, while these quiescent spiral galaxies\nhave prominent bulges, as interpreted from their high Sersic indexes, and are studied at radii smaller than their Re ,\nin some cases there will be some non-negligible contribution\nfrom the disk inside the fibre.\nIn this case, the median metallicity in the central regions of quiescent spirals is higher than that in early types.\nThe measured \u2206(Mgb/hFei) and light-weighted ages of spirals are consistent with the stellar populations of ellipticals\nat a given \u03c3v . The fact that at a given \u03c3v all the three\nphysical quantities re-scale in the same way with respect to\nellipticals when comparing to Fig. 5, indicates that the main\nsource of the differences between those plots is the different\nB/T ratio in ellipticals and spirals. This makes us question\nc\n\nRAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u2013??\n\n\fThe simlar stellar populations of quiescent spiral and elliptical galaxies\n\n7\n\nFigure 8. Distributions of metallicity, \u2206(Mgb/hFei and light-weighted age in different bins of central velocity dispersion for quiescent\nspiral (dotted line) and elliptical (solid line) galaxies. The probability of both samples to be drawn from the same distribution, obtained\nfrom a 2-sided Kolmogorov Smirnov test, is shown in each pannel. Bulges of quiescent spiral galaxies have higher metallicity than ellipticals\nwith the same \u03c3v at high confidence. \u03b1-enhancement and age differences bewtween the two samples are only marginally detected when\ncombining the three bins in \u03c3v . See text for more details.\n\nwhich is the parameter which correlates the strongest with\nstellar populations; total stellar mass, or bulge mass (central\nvelocity dispersion).\nAs shown in Fig. 7, we repeat the exercise performed in\nFigs. 5 and 6 but studying trends with stellar mass in bins\nof \u03c3v . In this case, there are only very weak (if at all) correlations between the age and \u03b1-enhancement in our galaxies and their total stellar mass, implying that the velocity\ndispersion correlates the strongests with these parameters.\nHowever, it seems that there is a residual correlation between the metallicity and the stellar mass even when we\nfactor out \u03c3v \u2013[Z/H] increases monotonically with stellar\nmass in all bins of \u03c3v and for both morphological types.\nWe will from now on assume that central velocity dispersion is a good proxy for the mass of the bulge. The calculation of the mass of the bulge from a direct measurement\nof \u03c3v can be, in principle, affected by the orbits of stars\nin the disk. However, Cappellari et al. (2006) use SAURON\n\u221a\ndata to show that central \u03c3V is proportional to M and\nweakly dependent on the orbital distributions. In addition\nc\n\nRAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u2013??\n\nwe select only relatively face-on spiral galaxies, minimizing\nthe impact of the disk's rotation on the \u03c3v measurement.\nThe difference in total stellar mass, at a given bulge\nmass, must come mainly from the disk. The lack of a trend\nin age and \u03b1 overabundance with total stellar mass, at fixed\nvelocity dispersion, indicates that the stellar mass of the disk\nis not relevant in shaping these physical parameters. Instead,\nthe residual trend in metallicity with total stellar mass at\na given bulge mass implies that the extra mass of the disk\nmight be relevant for the total metal content retained by the\ngalaxy.\nWe now quantify the statistical significance of any possible difference between spirals and ellipticals by studying\nnot only the median values of metallicity, \u2206(Mgb/hFei) and\nage, but the whole distribution of these parameters in bins\nof \u03c3v . We show these distributions in Fig. 8, where we have\nsplit our galaxy samples in three bins of central velocity dispersion. Using the 2-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test,\nwe find that the bulges of quiescent spirals are more metalrich than elliptical galaxies at fixed \u03c3v with high confidence\n(probability of the two samples to be drawn from the same\n\n\f8\n\nAday R.

The difference in the median values\nis at the level of \u223c 0.07 dex. While there are some differences in \u03b1\u2212enhancement and age (at least in some of the\n\u03c3v bins), their statistical significance is not large, so physical interpretation is unnecessary, especially considering the\ntypical uncertainties affecting the measurements.\nGallazzi et al. (2008) identified the systematic uncertainties affecting the derivation of the stellar population parameters. The main contributions to the error budget in the\ncase of metallicity are the lack of variation of [\u03b1/Fe] in BC03\nmodels, and to the choice of priors according to which the\nmodel library produces a galaxy's SFH5 . A combination of\nboth factors can add an error of up to 0.046 dex in [Z/H],\nwhich is more than half of the difference we find between\npassive spirals and ellipticals. However, the fact that we see\nthe same trend in all bins of \u03c3v and the different shape of the\ndistributions in Fig. 8 make us believe that there is a physical difference between the two galaxy samples. Moreover,\nwe have shown that [\u03b1/Fe] of spiral bulges and ellipticals\nare indistinguishable at fixed velocity dispersion, thus any\n\n5\n\nWe refer the reader to Gallazzi et al. (2008) for a full discussion\non systematic uncertainties in the modelling.\n\nbias introduced by \u03b1/Fe would affect their total metallicity\nin a similar way and have negligible effect on our differential\nanalysis.\nSo far, we have performed a differential analysis of the\nstellar populations in the central regions of spiral and elliptical galaxies, but we can not guarantee that all the light in the\nSDSS spectrograph fiber does indeed come from the bulge.\nIn order to minimize this potential contamination from disk\nlight we have chosen to work only with galaxies hosting quiescent disks, with stellar populations more similar to those\nin red and dead ellipticals than those in star forming disks.\nFurthermore it is possible to only select galxies for which the\nlight in the fiber is dominated by the stars in the bulge. In\norder to do this we use the catalog by Simard et al. (2011),\nwho have performed a bulge-disk decomposition for galaxies\nin the SDSS. We now choose only those galaxies for which\nat least 80% of the light in the fiber is originated by bulge\nstars and repeat the analysis shown in Fig. 8. It is worth\nnoting that the total number of elliptical (spiral) galaxies is\nreduced by a 10%(52%).\nOnce again the metallicity seems to be the only discrepant quantity between the bulges of passive spirals and\nellipticals at high significance (P \u223c 10\u22123 in all three bins).\nc\n\nRAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u2013??\n\n\fThe simlar stellar populations of quiescent spiral and elliptical galaxies\nThe distribution of age and \u03b1-enhancement in both galaxy\nsamples are relatively similar. Visual inspection of the distributions, as well as the KS test probabilities, shows that\nthe statistical evidence for a difference between the samples\nis inconclusive. High spatial resolution and 3D spectroscopy,\nrather than increasing sample size, would be more likely to\ntest this conclusively.\nOur findings point to a scenario in which the stellar\npopulation properties in the bulges of quiescent spiral and\nelliptical galaxies scale with the central velocity dispersion.\nWe find the youngest, less metallic, less \u03b1-enhanced objects\nto be those with the lower values of \u03c3v . This result is in\ngood qualitative agreement with that of Thomas & Davies\n(2006), despite notable difference in sample selection and\naperture definition. The main difference between the two\nworks is the statistical significance reached because we use\na sample \u223c 50 times larger. Our larger sample size could\nalso be driving our main discrepancy. While they find Z/H,\n\u03b1-enhancement and age of spiral bulges to be equivalent to\nthose in ellipticals at a given velocity dispersion, we find\nthat the metallicity in bulges of quiescent spirals is higher\nthan in elliptical galaxies.\nHowever, it seems that the metallicity of those stellar\npopulations also correlates with the total stellar mass of\nthe galaxy. We know that there is a fundamental correlation between the mass of a galaxy and its metal content\n(i.e., Tremonti et al., 2004; Gallazzi et al., 2005), and that\nits origin is likely due to the higher capacity of more massive\nsystems to retain metals in the presence of outflows.\nTaken together, our results imply that the formation\nepoch of galaxies and the duration of their star-forming period are linked to the mass of the bulge. The extent to which\nmetals are retained within the galaxy, not being removed as\na result of outflows, is determined by the total mass of the\ngalaxy.\nMasters et al. (2010) studied the stellar populations of\nred spirals, finding them to be systematically older and with\nless recent SF activity than blue spiral galaxies. Combining\ntheir results with those presented here, imply a scenario in\nwhich SFHs of red spirals are more similar to those of ellipticals than those of star forming spirals.\nWe are very conservative in the selection of quiescent galaxies, so it is possible that a population of disklike, low-level star formers do exist (and that is precisely\nwhat Wolf et al. (2009) and others report). However, a late\nquenching of the SF in disk galaxies could be reconciled with\nour results if, in spite of the relatively homogeneus color and\nlack of SF at z 6 0.1, there are radial gradients present in\nthe stellar populations ages. In other words, if these galaxies\ngrow inside-out (Barden et al., 2005) and the center of the\nobjects, where the bulk of the stellar populations resides,\nwas assembled at z > 1, the star formation per unit mass\nmight be small enough to not to leave behind a strong imprint in the global colors of the object by z 6 0.1, and make\nit into our sample.\nKuntschner et al. (2006) make use of SAURON survey\ndata in order to study the stellar populations of 48 early-type\ngalaxies. They find that the flattened component identified\nin fast-rotators does actually show an increase in the metallicity and a mildly depressed [\u03b1/Fe] ratio with respect to the\nmain body of the galaxy. Unfortunately their maps do not\ntypically cover regions much larger than Re , nor later morc\n\nRAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u2013??\n\n9\n\nphological types than S0s. Future surveys, like the recently\nstarted Calar Alto Large Integral Field Area (CALIFA) survey will provide 3D spectroscopy over the full optical extent\nof a statistically significant sample of galaxies of all morphological types (S\u00e1nchez et al., 2012), allowing to study\nthe stellar populations of quiescent spirals at larger radii.\nAssuming that similar \u03b1\u2212enhancements imply similar\nstar formation timescales, it seems reasonable to believe that\nwhatever the reason is after the shorter typical SF timescales\nin elliptical galaxies, it is very likely that the stars in the\nbulges of quiescent spirals share a common formation mode\nwith those in ellipticals. Furthermore, the fact that the lightweighted ages are similar at a given \u03c3v implies that the epoch\nof the star formation shut-off must also be placed at the same\nepoch, and any subsequent episode of star formation must\nhave happened at a lookback time high enough for any trace\nof young stellar populations to have dissapeared by today.\nWe would like to remind that while at stellar masses\nabove 1\u22122\u00d71011 M\u2299 the contribution of passive disks to the\ngrowth of the red sequence is very small (van der Wel et al.,\n2009), probably because of a merger-dominated formation history at those masses (van der Wel et al., 2009;\nRobaina et al., 2010), there are many passive disks contributing to such a growth since z \u223c 1 (Bundy et al., 2010;\nHolden et al., 2011) at lower masses. Therefore, it will be\nvery important to understand when and how do spiral galaxies without noticeable star formation activity in the local\nUniverse stopped forming stars. Future models of galaxy\nformation and evolution would have to be able to reproduce\nthe small difference in metallicity\n\n4\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have assembled a sample of galaxies with morphological\nclassifications from Galaxy Zoo and photometry and lightprofile fit parameters from the SDSS DR7, NYU-VAC. We\nperform a comparison between the stellar populations in the\ncentral regions of low inclination quiescent spiral galaxies\nand those in elliptical galaxies over the redshift range 0.04 <\nz < 0.1 and for galaxies with stellar masses above 1010.4 M\u2299 .\nSpecifically, we compare their r-band light-weighted ages,\nstellar metallicities and alpha-enhancement (as traced by\n\u2206(Mgb/hFei)), derived as in G05 and G06.The main results\nof this analysis are:\n\u2022 Central velocity dispersion is the observable with the\nstrongest correlation with stellar population parameters.\nWhen we fix \u03c3v we find no dependence of light-weighted age\nor \u03b1-enhancement with total stellar mass for both elliptical\nand quiescent spiral galaxies. In the case of passive spirals,\nif we assume that central velocity dispersion is a good proxy\nfor the bulge's mass, this implies that these parameters are\nindependent of the disk's stellar mass. However, there is a\nresidual correlation between [Z/H] and stellar mass even if\nwe factor out central \u03c3v .\n\u2022 The metallicity of the stars in the bulges is higher in\npassive spirals than in ellipticals, at a given central velocity dispersion, by \u223c 0.07 dex. On the other hand, median\nvalues and distributions of age and \u03b1-enhancement are statistically compatible in both galaxy samples. This, together\nwith the residual correlation found between metallicity and\ntotal stellar mass (bulge+disk), indicates a higher capacity\n\n\f10\n\nAday R. Robaina et al.\n\nof more massive systems to retain their metals during the\nprocess of star formation.\n\u2022 Our results are in good qualitative agreement with\nthose of Thomas & Davies (2006) in the case of age and\n\u03b1-enhancement despite notable differences in sample selection and aperture definition. Our finding of a lower [Z/H]\nin quiescent ellipticals is likely a cause, given how small the\ndifference is, of sample size.\n\u2022 As we are very strict with our criteria for selecting passive stellar populations, we are certainly not including in\nour sample all galaxies in transition from star-formers to\npassive-red. It is possible that our sample selection criteria\nare leaving out slightly less red disk galaxies with low levels\nof star formation and younger stellar populations, even if\nthey are already on the red sequence. Models of galaxy formation have to account for a very large range in structural\nand morphological properties among galaxies with similar\nstellar ages and star formation timescales.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors are thankful to the referee, whose comments and suggestions have greatly improved this work.\nA.
