INTRODUCTION\n\nThe metallicity of the interstellar medium (ISM) in\na galaxy is expected to increase with time due to the\nprogressive enrichment through stellar feedback. Consequently, one would expect that younger stars formed\nat the same galactic radius would have higher metallicities. In addition, the ISM metallicity has been well established to decrease with increasing galactic radius, r, due\nto a more efficient star formation and enrichment of the\nISM in the central regions of galaxies (Wilson and Rood\n1994; Daflon and Cunha 2004). This in turn would result in coeval stars being progressively more metal-poor\nas r increases.\nHowever, the metallicities of stars in the solar neighborhood (SN) have been observed to lack the expected\ncorrelation with age (Edvardsson et al. 1993; Haywood\n2008). Re-examining the age-metallicity distribution of\nthe Geneva-Copenhagen survey (Nordstr\u00f6m et al. 2004),\nHaywood (2008) found that the data are only consistent with the age-metallicity relation (AMR) for stars\nyounger than 3 Gyr. For other samples the width of the\nmetallicity distribution was found to be larger than what\ncould be accounted for by measurement errors and/or\ninhomogeneous ISM. Because of the age-velocity relation (AVR), where older stellar samples are observed to\nhave higher velocity dispersion than younger ones (e.g.\nHolmberg et al. 2009), stars from the inner and outer\nMilky Way (MW) disk can enter the SN and thus blur the\nexpected AMR. However, this can only account for about\n50 % of the observed scatter (Nordstr\u00f6m et al. 2004).\nA possible explanation for this discrepancy is the\nradial migration of stars from their birth guiding\nradii (Haywood 2008; Sch\u00f6nrich and Binney 2009). In1 Universit\u00e9\nde Strasbourg,\nCNRS, Observatoire Astronomique, 11 rue de l'Universit\u00e9, 67000 Strasbourg, France;\nivan.minchev@astro.unistra.fr\n\ndeed, there is now considerable evidence that the nonaxisymmetry of the Galactic potential can cause significant perturbations in the motion of both stars and gas:\nobservational evidence for this comes from (i) the observed non-circular motions of gas flows in the inner MW\n(Bissantz et al. 2003), (ii) the large non-axisymmetric\nmotions of star-forming regions (Xu et al. 2006), (iii)\nthe moving groups in the SN (Dehnen 1998) containing stars of very different ages (Famaey et al. 2005;\nAntoja et al. 2008), suggesting that their clumping in\nvelocity space is most likely not due to irregular star\nformation, but rather to dynamical perturbations from\nthe bar (Dehnen 2000; Minchev et al. 2010a) and/or\nthe spirals (e.g., Quillen and Minchev 2005, Antoja et al.\n2009), or an orbiting satellite galaxy (Quillen et al. 2009;\nMinchev et al. 2009).\nA numerically well-studied effect of this nonaxisymmetry of the Galactic potential is the radial migration of stars due to resonant scattering by transient\nspiral structure (SS) (Sellwood and Binney 2002, hereafter SB02; Ro\u0161kar et al. 2008), which could explain the\naforementioned absence of AMR in the SN. N-body simulations based on cosmological initial conditions (e.g.,\nHeller et al. 2007) would a priori be the most natural\nframework in which to study radial mixing in galactic\ndisks. However, these simulations cannot at present produce large enough thin galactic disks due to the transfer of angular momentum from the disk to the live\ndark matter halo. The resulting galaxies are typically\nthick and present large stellar velocity dispersions, so\nthat they are closer to S0 galaxies than to MW-like\nones (S\u00e1nchez-Bl\u00e1zquez et al. 2009). On the other hand,\nRo\u0161kar et al. (2008) used an N-body hydrodynamical\nmodel in which the initial conditions were designed to\nmimic the stage following a last major merger when the\nthin disk formation is supposed to start. Both SB02 and\nRo\u0161kar et al. (2008) compare the effects of radial migra-\n\n\f2\ntion in the MW disk, for which the existence of a bar is\nfirmly established, to a simulated galaxy lacking a central\nbar. Unless the effect of the bar is unimportant to the\nmixing process, their results would only poorly approximate the radial migration in our Galaxy. In this paper\nwe check whether the effect of galactic bars can indeed\nbe neglected in the context of radial migration in galactic\ndisks, as assumed in a number of previous studies. For\nthis purpose we study the combined effect of SS and a\ncentral bar (and more generally of multiple patterns) on\nthe radial mixing of stars in a stellar disk.\nThere is observational evidence for multiple patterns\nin external galaxies, such as asymmetries in the spiral structure (e.g. Henry et al. 2003; Meidt et al. 2008).\nBy expanding galaxy images in Fourier components,\nElmegreen et al. (1992) noted that many galaxies exhibit hidden three-armed components and suggested that\nmultiple spiral density waves can propagate simultaneously in galaxy discs. In addition, by means of\nthe recently developed (Merrifield et al. 2006) Radial\nTremaine-Weinberg (TWR) method, Meidt et al. (2009)\nanalyzed the high-quality HI and CO data cubes available for four spiral galaxies. The authors found direct\nevidence for the presence of resonant coupling of multiple patterns, including spiral-spiral and spiral-bar components.\nThe results of N-body simulations provide additional\nmotivation for studying the dynamical effects of multiple patterns. Sellwood (1985) and Sellwood and Sparke\n(1988) presented N-body experiments in which a bar coexists with a spiral pattern moving at a much lower angular velocity. Tagger et al. (1987) and Sygnet et al. (1988)\nexplained this as a non-linear mode coupling between\na bar and SS. Sellwood's simulations, and the theoretical explanation of Tagger et al. (1987) and Sygnet et al.\n(1988), were later confirmed by Masset and Tagger\n(1997) and Rautiainen and Salo (1999).\nHow do multiple patterns affect the dynamics of galactic disks? Quillen (2003) considered the dynamics of\nstars that are affected by perturbations from both SS and\na central bar by constructing a one-dimensional Hamiltonian model for the strongest resonances in the epicyclic\naction-angle variables. Quillen pointed out that when\ntwo perturbers with different pattern speeds are present\nin the disc, the stellar dynamics can be stochastic, particularly near resonances associated with one of the patterns. Similar findings were presented more recently by\nJalali (2008). All these results are not surprising since it\nhas already been shown by Chirikov (1979) that in the\ncase of resonance overlap the last KAM surface between\nthe two resonances is destroyed, resulting in stochastic\nbehavior. We therefore expect that resonance overlap\ncould give rise to both velocity dispersion increase and\nradial migration.\nIn this paper we study the combined effect of a central bar and SS on the dynamics of a galactic disk. We\nconcentrate on a steady-state SS in order to assess the\npure effect of non-linear coupling between the two perturbers, noting that while there is strong circumstantial evidence that SS is mostly not-stationary in unbarred galaxies, the situation is less clear in barred ones\n(Binney and Tremaine 2008). In any case, the following\nmodel can also serve as a proxy for studying the effect of\ntransients, and is complementary to the transient spiral\n\nFig. 1.- Resonances in a galactic disk for nearly circular orbits and a flat rotation curve. Corotation occurs along the dotted\nblack curve and is given by \u03a9b,s = \u03a9(r), where \u03a9b,s is the bar or\nspiral pattern speed, \u03a9(r) = v0 /r is the local circular frequency,\nand v0 is the constant circular velocity. The 2:1 outer and inner\nLindblad resonances (OLR and ILR) occur along the solid black\ncurves, computed as \u03a9b,s = \u03a9(r) \u00b1 \u03ba/2, where \u03ba is the local radial epicyclic frequency. The outer and inner 4:1 LRs occur along\nthe dashed black curves, given by \u03a9b,s = \u03a9(r) \u00b1 \u03ba/4. The red\nhorizontal line indicates the bar pattern speed used in this paper,\n\u03a9b = 55.5 km/s/kpc, and the blue horizontal line shows a spiral\npattern speed of \u03a9s = 24 km/s/kpc, such as the one used in the\nsimulations shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The vertical red and blue lines\ngive the radial positions of each resonance for the bar and spiral\nstructure, respectively (solid lines: 2:1; dashed lines: 4:1, dotted\nlines: CR).\n\nmechanism developed by SB02.\n2. RESONANCES IN GALACTIC DISKS\n\nGalactic disks rotate differentially with nearly flat rotation curves, i.e., constant circular velocity as a function\nof galactic radius. In contrast, density waves, such as a\ncentral bar or SS, rotate as solid bodies. Therefore stars\nat different radii would experience different forcing due\nto the non-axisymmetric structure. Of particular interest to us are locations in the disk where the stars are\nin resonance with the perturber. The corotation resonance (CR), where stars move with the pattern, occur\nwhen the angular rotation rate of stars equals that of the\nperturber. The Lindblad resonances (LRs) occur when\nthe frequency at which a star feels the force due to a\nperturber coincides with the star's epicyclic frequency,\n\u03ba. As one moves inward or outward from the corotation\ncircle, the relative frequency at which a star encounters\nthe perturber increases. There are two values of r for\nwhich this frequency is the same as the radial epicyclic\nfrequency. This is where the inner and outer Lindblad\nresonances (ILR and OLR) are located. Quantitatively,\nLRs occur when \u03a9b,s = \u03a9 \u00b1 \u03ba/m, where m is the multiplicity of the pattern. The negative sign corresponds\nto the ILR and the positive to the OLR. While Bertil\nLindblad defined these for the case of an m=2 pattern\n(thus strictly speaking the ILR/OLR are the 2:1 resonances), for an m=4 pattern the ILR/OLR must be the\n4:1 resonances.\nSince second order resonances, i.e., 4:1 for a 2-armed\nspiral or bar, or 2:1 for a 4-armed spiral, can also be quite\nimportant (as will be shown later), we need to have a convenient way to refer to them. It is somewhat confusing\n\n\f3\nand unclear how the 4:1 resonances are referred to in the\nliterature. The inner 4:1 resonance for an m=2 pattern\nis known as the Ultra-harmonic resonance (UHR). Some\nalso describe the inner and outer 4:1 resonances as the\nIUHR and the OUHR, others as the inner and outer m=4\nresonance. If the pattern multiplicity is m=4, then these\nbecome the ILR and OLR. To our knowledge, there is no\nterminology for the 2:1 resonances of an m=4 pattern.\nTo simplify things, in this paper we generalize the standard notation of Lindblad resonances to allow for the\nexistence of both 2:1 and 4:1 resonances, regardless of\nthe multiplicity of the pattern. In other words, we will\nrefer to the 2:1 ILR/OLR and the 4:1 ILR/OLR for both\n2-armed (or bar) and 4-armed SS. Naturally, other resonances can also be described in this manner, i.e., 3:1,\n5:1, 6:1 ILR/OLR, etc.\nFig. 1 illustrates the relationship between the pattern\nangular velocity and the radii at which resonances occur\nfor a flat rotation curve and nearly circular orbits. Note\nthat for two (or more) nonaxisymmetric patterns (such\nas bar + SS or SS + SS) moving at different angular\nvelocities there will always exist regions in the disk where\nresonances overlap. As we will see later, this turns out\nto be crucial for the dynamics of barred galaxies.\n3. NUMERICAL PROCEDURE AND CHOICE OF\nPARAMETERS\n\nWe follow the motion of test particles in an initially\naxisymmetric, 2D stellar disk with a flat rotation curve\nas described in detail in Minchev and Quillen (2007), in\nwhich we grow non-axisymmetric perturbations as described below. Both the initial disk stellar density, \u03a3(r),\nand the radial velocity dispersion, \u03c3r (r), decrease exponentially with radius, where we initially start with\n\u03c3r (rd ) = 5 km/s at the disk scale-length, rd = 3 kpc for\na MW-type galaxy. To simulate the effect of a central\nbar and spiral density waves we impose perturbations on\nthe initially axisymmetric disk as done by Minchev et al.\n(2007) and Minchev and Quillen (2007), respectively.\nBoth bar and spiral perturbations are grown simultaneously in 0.4 Gyr by increasing their amplitudes form 0 to\nthe maximum values. To ensure a smooth transition to\nthe perturbed state we use the function defined in eq. 4\nfrom Dehnen (2000). To be able to relate parameters to\nthe MW we work in units of the solar distance and circular velocity with corresponding values r0 = 8 kpc and\nvc = 240 km/s; this gives \u03a90 = 30 km/s/kpc.\nWhile\nin\nMinchev and Quillen\n(2007)\nand\nMinchev et al. (2007) we required the integration\nof a large number of particles in order to be able to\nresolve a \"solar neighbourhood\", here we are interested\nin the global behavior of a galactic disk. Therefore we\nhave found it sufficient to integrate 105 particles for\neach simulation, distributed between an inner and outer\nradii, rin = 2 and rout = 15 kpc. We have verified\nthat increasing the resolution to 107 particles does not\nchange our results. We divide each sample into 50 radial\nbins and calculate the azimuthally averaged changes in\nangular momentum in the disk in order to estimate the\ninduced radial migration. The time evolution of each\nsimulation is followed for 3 Gyr. We distinguish between\nthe SS and the bar by indicating the OLR as OLRs and\nOLRb , respectively, and similarly for the case of the\nILR.\n\n3.1. Perturbation from a central bar\nThe bar strength, \u01ebb , for the case of the MW, is defined\nas the ratio of the forces due to the bar's quadrupole and\nthe axisymmetric background at the Sun's radius, r0 ,\non the bar's major axis, \u01ebb = 3(Ab /vc2 )(rb /r0 )3 (Dehnen\n2000), where vc is the asymptotic circular velocity. The\nbar potential is then given by\n\uf8f1\n\u0001\nrb 3\n\uf8f2\n, r \u2265 rb\nr\n\u0010 \u00113\n\u03a6b = Ab (\u01ebb ) cos[2(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03a9b t)] \u00d7\nr\n\uf8f3 2\u2212 r\n, r \u2264 rb\nb\n\n(1)\nwhere rb = 0.8rcr is the bar half-length in terms of\nits CR, rcr ; in physical units rb = 3.44 kpc and rcr =\n4.3 kpc.\nPrevious work has used as a measure of bar strength\nthe parameter QT (Combes and Sanders 1981). This is\nthe ratio of the maximum tangential force to the azimuthally averaged radial force at a given radius. From\neq. 1 this definition yields QT = 2Ab /vc2 . We examine bar\namplitudes in the range 0.1 < QT < 0.4 as expected from\nobservations of various galaxies and from N-body simulations (Combes and Sanders 1981). This corresponds to\n0.013 < |\u01ebb | < 0.05 in our units.\nThe bar pattern speed is chosen to be \u03a9b = 55.5\nkm/s/kpc, which for the case of our Galaxy can be written as \u03a9b = 1.85\u03a90 . This value is consistent with observations of external galaxies where it is found that bars are\ndynamically fast, i.e., rcr /rb = 1.2 \u00b1 0.2 (Aguerri et al.\n2003), and is also in accordance with recent bar pattern\nspeed determinations for the MW (Minchev et al. 2010a,\n2007; Bissantz et al. 2003; Dehnen 2000).\n3.2. Perturbation from spiral structure\nThe spiral potential is given by\nr\n\u2212 m(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03a9s t)],\n\u03a6s (r, \u03c6, t) = \u01ebs cos[\u03b1 ln\nr0\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u01ebs is the SS strength, related to the amplitude of\nthe mass surface density of spirals, \u03a3s , as\n\u01ebs \u2248 \u22122\u03c0G\u03a3s r0 /(\u03b1vc2 ),\n\n(3)\n\nas shown in Binney and Tremaine (2008). The parameter \u03b1 is related to the pitch angle of the spirals, p, by\n\u03b1 = m cot(p). The azimuthal wavenumber m is an integer corresponding to the number of arms. We consider\nboth 2-armed and 4-armed SS with \u03b1 = \u22124 and -8, respectively, where the negative sign corresponds to trailing spirals. Elmegreen (1998) found that grand-design\nspirals have arm-interarm contrasts of 1.5-6, corresponding to a fractional amplitude of 0.2 < \u03a3s /\u03a3 < 0.7, which\nis in agreement with Rix and Zaritsky (1995) who estimated 0.15 < (\u03a3s /\u03a3) < 0.6. Since we would like to examine this range of spiral amplitudes we need to relate\nthe relative overdensity to the relative potential.\nFor a maximum exponential disk the peak\np circular\nspeed in the disk has the value vc \u2243 0.622 GMd /rd\nat r \u2243 2.15rd, where Md is the disk mass inclosed\nby rd . The surface density of the disk at radius r is\n\u03a3(r) = (Md /2\u03c0rd2 )e\u2212r/rd . Eliminating Md from these\nexpressions, we find at r0 , vc2 \u2243 0.39 \u00d7 2\u03c0Grd \u03a30 er0 /rd .\nSubstituting this expression for vc in eq. 3, the relation\n\n\f4\n\nFig. 2.- Changes in angular momentum, \u2206L, as a function of the initial angular momentum, L0 . Both \u2206L and L0 are in units the\ncircular velocity, vc ; L0 is thus equivalent to the galactocentric distance, r, in kpc. Bar and SS amplitudes are indicated in each panel. The\nfirst two panels form left to right present simulations with a bar of an intermediate strength (QT = 0.25) and a strong one (QT = 0.4),\nrespectively. The third and fourth panels show a 4-armed SS with relative overdensity \u03a3s /\u03a30 = 0.2, 0.35. The rightmost panel presents\na simulation with a 2-armed SS with an amplitude giving rise to \u03a3s /\u03a30 = 0.25. The dotted lines show the corotation radii. The 2:1 and\n4:1 LRs are indicated by the solid and dashed lines respectively (bar=red, spiral=blue). Note that, depending on the pattern speed, some\nresonances might not be present in the disk. |\u2206L| increases significantly only near the corotation of each perturber.\n\nFig. 3.- Time evolution of the changes in angular momentum, \u2206L, for a stellar disk perturbed by both a central bar and SS. The top\nrow shows a bar and a 4-armed SS of intermediate strengths: \u01ebb = \u22120.03 (QT = 0.25) and \u01ebs = \u22120.02 (\u03a3s /\u03a30 = 0.35 for m=4). For the\nbottom row the bar and the 2-armed SS are weaker: \u01ebb = \u22120.02 (QT = 0.16) and \u01ebs = \u22120.03 (\u03a3s /\u03a30 = 0.25 for m=2). The increase of\n\u2206L with time indicates that stars are being placed on radii different than their birthplaces, i.e., radial migration takes place throughout\nthe disk.\n\nbetween the relative potential and the relative overdensity becomes\n\u2212r0\n\n\u03a3s r0 e rd\n\u01ebs \u2248 \u2212\n.\n(4)\n\u03a30 rd 0.39\u03b1\nTo correct for finite disk thickness we need to decrease the right-hand side of this equation by the factor e\u2212kz0 (e.g., Vandervoort 1970), where k is the wave\nvector given by k \u2248 \u03b1/r0 . For a MW-type galaxy we\ncan adopt a disk scale-height of z0 \u223c 300 pc, resulting\nin e\u2212kz0 \u2248 0.86 and 0.74 for a 2- and 4-armed SS, respectively. Using eq. 4 and accounting for finite disk\nthickness we estimate that the observed spiral arm amplitudes quoted above would result in potential perturbation in the range 0.007 < |\u01ebs | < 0.031 for a 4-armed\nand 0.015 < |\u01ebs | < 0.072 for a 2-armed SS.\n4. SINGLE PERTURBATION\n\nWe now estimate the changes in angular momentum,\n\u2206L, in a stellar disk. To do this, we divide the disk into\n50 radial bins and compute \u2206L = L1 \u2212 L0 , where L0 and\nL1 are the mean values of the initial (at t = 0) and final\n(at some later time, t1 ) angular momenta of particles in\neach bin.\n\nIn Fig. 2 we show \u2206L as a function of L0 for a simulation with a single perturber. Both axes are in units of the\ncircular velocity, vc ; L0 is thus equivalent to the galactocentric distance, r in kpc. The bar and SS amplitudes are\nindicated in each panel. The first two panels from left to\nright present simulations with a bar of an intermediate\nstrength (QT = 0.25) and a strong one (QT = 0.4), respectively. The third and fourth panels show a 4-armed\nSS with relative overdensity \u03a3s /\u03a30 = 0.2, 0.35. The\nrightmost panel presents a simulation with a 2-armed SS\nwith an amplitude giving rise to \u03a3s /\u03a30 = 0.25. The dotted lines show the corotation radii. The 2:1 and 4:1 LRs\nare indicated by the solid and dashed vertical lines, respectively (bar=red, spiral=blue). Note that, depending\non the pattern speed, certain resonances might not be\npresent in the disk. The pattern speeds are given in units\nof the angular velocity at r0 = 8 kpc, \u03a90 = 30 km/s/kpc.\nSignificant angular momentum changes in Fig. 2 occur\nonly near the CR of each perturber (dotted lines). No\nfurther increase in |\u2206L| is apparent with time once the\nperturber is fully grown, which is to be expected for a\ntime-independent perturbation. We are now interested\nto see what changes occur when both the bar and SS act\n\n\f5\n\nFig. 4.- The changes in angular momentum at t = 3 Gyr for simulations with different perturbation strengths, while all other parameters\nare kept fixed. From left to right the bar strength increases as indicated in each panel. The SS strength increases from top to bottom.\nNote the bimodality caused by the bar's corotation and its 2:1 OLR.\n\ntogether.\n5. BAR + SPIRAL STRUCTURE\n\nAs shown by Minchev and Quillen (2006), when two\nperturbers moving at different pattern speeds are imposed on a galactic disk, an increase in the random motions of stars is expected, i.e., the disk heats. In addition,\nthe authors found that in regions of resonance overlap\nstars drift radially with time from their birth radii. This\nsuggests that such a mechanism could be responsible for\nradial migration in the disk. Here we quantify this idea\nmore clearly for the case of bar + SS, by examining the\neffect of the simultaneous propagation of the two perturbers.\n5.1. Time evolution of \u2206L\n\nIn Fig. 3 we show the time development of the changes\nof angular momentum in a stellar disk perturbed by both\na central bar and SS. In each row we present a different\ncombination of bar and SS strengths, as described bellow,\nwhile all other parameters are kept fixed. As in Fig. 2,\ncontour plots show the change in angular momentum,\n\u2206L, as a function of the initial angular momentum L0\n(or radius, r in kpc). Panels from left to right show the\ntemporal evolution of the system for 0.3, 0.6, 1.2, 1.8 and\n2.5 Gyr. In the top row both the bar and the 4-armed\n\nSS have intermediate strengths: \u01ebb = \u22120.03 (QT = 0.25)\nand \u01ebs = \u22120.02 (\u03a3s /\u03a30 = 0.35 for m=4). For the bottom\nrow the bar and the 2-armed SS are weaker: \u01ebb = \u22120.02\n(QT = 0.16) and \u01ebs = \u22120.03 (\u03a3s /\u03a30 = 0.25 for m=2).\nThe pattern speeds in both simulations are the same so\nthat we can asses the effect of the different amplitudes.\nExamining the first row of Fig. 3, we note that at\nthe beginning of the simulation |\u2206L| increases mainly\nat the CR of each perturber (dotted lines), which would\nbe the case of linearly adding the individual effects of\nthe bar and SS seen in Fig. 2. However, at later times\nlarge changes in angular momentum occur, suggesting\nthat non-linear effects become important. Note that at\nt = 0.6 Gyr the effect near each CR is already stronger\nthan that expected from each individual perturber (compare to Fig. 2). Meanwhile the area between the CRs of\nthe bar and SS fills in with time as a result of the proximity of the 4:1 ILRs , the 4:1 OLRb and the 2:1 OLRb , thus\nextending the effect over the entire disc. At t = 1.8 Gyr\n(fourth panel of Fig. 3), the changes in angular momentum throughout the disk are similar in amplitude to those\nresulting from recurrent spirals (Fig. 11 in SB02). To\nreach this level of mixing, however, requires less than\n\u223c 2 Gyr compared to \u223c 9 Gyr for the case of transients.\nDecreasing the bar strength to \u01ebb = \u22120.02 (QT = 0.16)\n(bottom row of Fig. 3) and considering a slightly weaker\n\n\f6\n\nFig. 5.- Variation of mixing with pattern speed ratio. \u2206L is shown for different SS pattern speeds, \u03a9s , while keeping \u03a9b the same.\nThis results in different spacing of the bar and SS resonances. From left to right the 4-armed SS moves at \u03a9s = 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, and 1.1 in\nunits of \u03a90 = 30 km/s/kpc. All other simulation parameters are kept fixed: the time is t = 3 Gyr and the strengths of the perturbers are\nthe same as in the top row of Fig. 3. As expected, the effect of resonance overlap on \u2206L is strongest when the highest order resonances\n(2:1 OLRb and 4:1 ILRs ) lie closest to each other (leftmost panel, L0 \u223c 7.5).\n\n2-armed SS has a weaker effect on \u2206L. However, changes\nin \u2206L are still very strong, mixing the disk in less than\n3 Gyr.\nAt this time we can already identify two main differences between radial migration from transients and the\nmechanism described in this work: (1) The time-scale\nfor disk mixing is much shorter in the case of resonance\noverlap and (2) resonance overlap causes a bimodal distribution in \u2206L with peaks near the bar's CR and its\n2:1 OLR, compared to the single peak seen in Fig. 11\nand 12 in SB02. Next we explore further the effect of\nperturbation strengths.\n5.2. Variation with perturbation strengths\n\nThe strong increase of |\u2206L| with time when both a bar\nand SS perturb a stellar disk suggests that this is a nonlinear effect. We therefore expect strong variation with\nthe strength of the perturbers. To investigate this further we now explore the effect on mixing when different\ncombinations of \u01ebs and \u01ebb are considered. In Fig. 4 we\nplot the changes in angular momentum at t = 3 Gyr for\nsimulations with different perturbation strengths, while\nall other parameters are kept fixed. From left to right the\nbar strength increases as indicated in each panel. The SS\nstrength increases from top to bottom.\nObserving the top, leftmost panel of Fig. 4 we see that\nwhen both perturbers are weak mixing is not very strong,\nalthough an increase in |\u2206L| near the 2:1 OLRb is still\napparent. However, as the bar strength increases, while\nkeeping the spiral weak, the resonance overlap in the inner disk has a surprisingly strong effect on \u2206L. To realize\nthis compare the top row of Fig. 4 to the corresponding\nbar strengths in Fig. 2. Similar behavior is observed in\nthe case of a weak bar and a range of SS strengths (first\ncolumn in Fig. 4). Note that here in addition to the inner\ndisk we also see a strong effect near the spirals' CR at\n10 kpc, which is well outside the 2:1 OLRb . A possible\nexplanation could be the proximity of the CR of SS to\nthe bar's 1:1 asymmetric, 1:1 symmetric resonances, or\nx\u22171 (2) unstable orbits (Dehnen 2000).\n5.3. Variation with pattern speed ratio\n\nIn Fig. 5 we plot \u2206L for different SS pattern speeds,\n\u03a9s , while keeping \u03a9b the same. This results in different\nspacing of the bar and SS resonances. From left to right\nthe 4-armed SS moves at \u03a9s = 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, and 1.1\nin units of \u03a90 = 30 km/s/kpc. All other simulation\nparameters are kept fixed: the time is t = 3 Gyr and\nthe strengths of the perturbers are the same as in the\n\ntop row of Fig. 3. As one would expect, the effect of\nresonance overlap on \u2206L is strongest when the highest\norder resonances (2:1 OLRb and 4:1 ILRs ) lie very close\nto each other (leftmost panel, L0 \u223c 7.5). For all pattern\nspeed ratios the distribution of \u2206L exhibits a bimodality\nnear the bar's CR and near its 2:1 OLR. This signature\ncan be used to identify the mechanism described here in\nfully self-consistent simulations, where the disk dynamics\nis much more complicated and may include additional\nmixing due to transient spirals and small mergers.\n6. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE MILKY WAY\n\nWe showed in Sec. 5 that the simultaneous propagation\nof a central bar and SS in a stellar disk induces radial\nmigration. Since this is a nonlinear effect, depending on\nthe perturbers' amplitudes, strong mixing could occur\nin a short period of time. Similarly to the majority of\ndisk galaxies, the MW has been well established to be a\nbarred galaxy, thus we expect mixing due to resonance\noverlap to be at work here as well. While there is no\ndoubt that the MW has been affected by this process, it\nmay be difficult to estimate exactly how. This migration\nmechanism is a strong function of the strengths of the\nMW bar and SS. However, it may be incorrect to use\nthe currently observed spiral and bar amplitudes since\nmost likely they have not been the same throughout the\nlifetime of the Galaxy. In fact, we expect that spirals\nwere stronger in the past, when the disk velocity dispersion was lower, thus resulting in a more gravitationally\nunstable disk. In any case, given that the past history of\nthe MW spiral and bar structure is largely unknown, we\nwill make an estimate of how much mixing could have\nresulted by using the currently observed SS and bar parameters.\n6.1. Choice of bar and spiral structure parameters\n\nFor all simulations in this paper we have used a\nbar pattern speed of \u03a9b = 1.85\u03a90 , where \u03a90 is the\nangular velocity at the solar circle r0 . For r0 =\n8 kpc and vc = 240 km/s, in physical units \u03a9b =\n55.5 km/s/kpc, consistent with recent pattern speed\nestimates (Minchev et al. 2010a, 2007; Bissantz et al.\n2003; Dehnen 2000). Rodriguez-Fernandez and Combes\n(2008) estimated the strength of the MW bar to lie in\nthe range 0.25 < QT < 0.4 by fitting bar models to near\ninfrared observations (2MASS counts). In the units used\nin this paper this range corresponds to 0.03 < |\u01ebb | < 0.05.\nThe individual effect on \u2206L of bars with amplitudes\n\u01ebb = \u22120.03 and \u01ebb = \u22120.05 can be seen in Fig. 2.\n\n\f7\n\nFig. 6.- The distribution of the initial radii of stars, which have ended up in an annulus of 400 pc (in the green bin) centered at a given\ngalactocentric distance, r. Simulation parameters are consistent with the Milky Way structure (see Sec. 6). From top to bottom different\nrows show the time evolution of each such annulus centered on r = 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 kpc. The black and red histograms show stars on\nnearly circular orbits (\u03c3r \u223c 5 km/s) and the total population, respectively. With this new mechanism, the solar neighborhood stars could\nhave come from a wide range of Galactic radii, including from the outer Galaxy, and thus account for the flatness of the observed AMR.\nNote the different signature in the mixing of cold and hot orbits.\n\nThe MW SS parameters are much more uncertain. It\nhas been proposed to be a superposition of 2- and 4armed patterns moving near corotation with the Sun\n(L\u00e9pine et al. 2001; Torra et al. 2000). On the other\nhand, Martos et al. (2004) and Bissantz et al. (2003)\nmatched the properties of the gas in the inner Galaxy\nwith a 4-armed SS with a pattern speed of 20 km/s/kpc\n(or with the Sun near the 4:1 ILR). The MW SS\nat this stage in the Galaxy evolution appears to be\nquite weak compared to observations of external galaxies: Drimmel and Spergel (2001) derived \u03a3s /\u03a30 = 0.15\nfor the stellar component (based on K-band observations). These authors, however, suggested that most\nlikely this value is larger. There are also indications\n\nfrom the gas flow in the inner Galaxy that the MW has\nstronger spiral arms, where the amplitude in the mass\ndensity is larger by a factor of 1.5 than its amplitude in\nthe near-infrared luminosity density (see Bissantz et al.\n2003; Famaey and Binney 2005). Therefore, a possible\nrange for the relative overdensity is 0.15 < \u03a3s /\u03a30 < 0.23.\nThese values, including the correction for finite disk\nthickness (Sec. 3.2), correspond to a potential perturbation of 0.015 < |\u01ebs | < 0.024 and 0.007 < |\u01ebs | < 0.01 for\na 2- and 4-armed SS, respectively.\nFrom the discussion above, for parameters consistent\nwith our Galaxy, the amount and rate of mixing due to\nspiral-bar resonance overlap is given by the second row of\nFig. 4 for a 4-armed SS, and by the bottom row for a 2-\n\n\f8\n\nFig. 7.- Radial velocity dispersion as a function of time at the\nsolar radius (solid line) for the simulation in Fig. 6. The dashed\nline shows a power-law fit to the simulated data. The dotted line\nplots the observed age-velocity relation in the solar neighborhood\n(Holmberg et al. 2009).\n\narmed SS (excluding the leftmost panels in both cases).\nNote that the strength of the 2-armed SS in Fig. 4 is\nslightly stronger than the estimated range.\n6.2. Mixing at different Galactic radii\n\nTo see in greater detail how stars migrate throughout\nthe disk we now examine the effect on mixing at different\ngalactic radii. To be consistent with MW parameters, we\nuse the simulation for which we presented the changes in\nangular momentum in Fig. 4, second row, second column. In Fig. 6 we show the distribution of birth radii\n(at t = 0) of stars which are \"currently\" (at the time\nindicated in each plot) in an annulus of 400 pc (in the\ngreen bin). Each row shows an annulus centered on a\ndifferent galactic radius, r: from top to bottom r = 2,\n4, 6, 8, and 10 kpc. To show the effect on stars placed\non nearly circular orbits, the black histograms plot only\nstars withpa cut in the eccentricity, e < 12. We estimate\ne as e \u2248 (u2 + 2v 2 )/2, appropriate for a flat rotation\ncurve (Arifyanto and Fuchs 2006), and u, v are the radial\nand tangential velocity components of stars with the circular velocity subtracted. The radial velocity dispersion\nresulting for this sample is \u223c 5 km/s, insuring that stellar orbits are almost circular. The red histograms show\nthe full sample. Stars on cold orbits, shown by the (normalized) black histograms, constitute about 10% of the\ntotal population.\nFirstly, note that the distributions peak at radii near\nregions of resonance overlap, as expected. While in the\ninner disk (r = 2 and 4 kpc) there are strong weights at\nlarger radii, the situation is reversed for r \u2265 6 kpc. At\nthe solar distance, r = 8 kpc (fourth row in Fig. 6), a\nlarge population of stars from the bar's CR (r \u223c 4.5 kpc)\nenters the solar circle. Naturally, when the total population is considered (red histogram) more stars enter from\nthe inner disk due to the exponential profiles of both the\ndensity and the radial velocity dispersion. Observe also\nthe overall shift toward larger radii of the cold population\ncompared to the total sample.\nWhile the pattern speed of the MW SS is not well\nconstrained, the bar is well established to have its 2:1\nOLR just inside the solar circle. Since the bar's CR and\nOLR are both strong and roughly invariable (only small\nchanges in the bar parameters are expected in \u223c 3 Gyr),\nwe can expect to find a bimodal distribution of \u2206L with\npeaks at these bar resonances regardless of the SS pattern\n\nspeed. That is exactly what is seen in Fig. 5. What if the\nMW spirals were transient? In that case the distribution\nof the changes in angular momentum can be approximated by the linear combination of a range of simulations\nwith different SS pattern speeds (imagine adding up all\npanels in Fig. 5). This would again result in a bimodal\ndistribution. Therefore, although the past history of the\nMW structure is not known and a large range of possible perturber strengths, pattern speeds and longevity\nexists, it would be reasonable to expect to always find a\nbimodality in the distribution of \u2206L.\nConsequently, the large fraction of stars coming from\nthe bar's CR which enters the solar circle (fourth row\nof Fig. 6) may be one of the observational signatures of\nthe spiral-bar resonance overlap mechanism. This is expected to affect the local metallicity distribution of stars.\nWe also note that a large fraction of stars comes from the\nouter disk, roughly 40% of all stars for this particular\npattern speed ratio. This is consistent with the metalpoor stars from the outer Galaxy scattered into the SN,\nas recently inferred from observational data (Haywood\n2008), and a metal-rich population coming from the inner\nGalaxy. With this new mechanism, the SN stars could\nhave come from a wide range of Galactic disk radii, including from the outer Galaxy, and thus can account for\nthe flatness of the observed AMR.\nOn the other hand, away from the solar circle we expect\nto find overdensities of stars originating at the bar's 2:1\nOLR. We clearly see this in the initial distribution of\nstars ending up in the annuli centered on r = 2, 4, 6 and\n10 kpc (Fig. 6). This may provide another observable for\nidentifying the currently discussed mechanism.\nHowever, the most promising technique to put constraints on this mechanism in the MW is \"chemical tagging\" (Freeman and Bland-Hawthorn 2002). The idea is\nto use the detailed chemical abundance patterns of individual stars in our Galaxy to associate them with common ancient star-forming aggregates with similar abundance patterns. This technique will be very important\nto characterize the star formation and chemical histories of the MW. Chemical tagging will become possible with the HERMES survey on the Anglo-Australian\nTelescope (AAT; Freeman and Bland-Hawthorn 2008;\nFreeman et al. 2010) and the APOGEE survey at the\nApache Point Observatory (Allende Prieto et al. 2008).\nTherefore, in the next couple of years we may be in a\nposition to directly measure the spread of open clusters\nacross the Galaxy as a function of age, thus providing\ndirect constraints on the amount of mixing in the Milky\nWay (Bland-Hawthorn et al. 2010).\n6.3. The effect on disk heating\nNow we look at the effect on the increase of random motion of stars with time. The observed correlation between the ages and velocity dispersions\nof SN stars has been a subject of study since the\nwork of Spitzer and Schwarzschild (1951, 1953) (see\nMinchev and Quillen 2006 for a detailed introduction).\nDeferent mechanisms have been proposed to explain\nthe age-velocity relation (AVR) (or stellar disk heating), including scattering by giant molecular clouds\n(GMC) (e.g., Mihalas and Binney 1981) and transient spirals (e.g., Barbanis and Woltjer 1967).\nIn\nMinchev and Quillen (2006) we showed that the reso-\n\n\f9\nnance overlap of multiple spiral patterns provides yet\nanother mechanism for disk heating. We therefore expect that an overlap of bar and SS resonances would\ngive a similar result. To check if this is indeed the case,\nin Fig. 7 we plot the radial velocity dispersion, \u03c3r , (solid\nline) as a function of time for the same simulation used\nto produce Fig. 6. The dashed line shows a power-law\nfit to our simulated data: \u03c3r \u223c t0.29 . To compare to\nobservations we also show the AVR in the SN (dotted\nline), as estimated recently from analysis of the GenevaCopenhagen Survey data (Holmberg et al. 2009). Note\nthat the observed AVR goes like \u03c3r \u223c t0.39 . Moreover, in\nour simulation the disk heats \u223c 20% more than observed.\nThere could be several possibilities that could account for\nthis discrepancy: (1) our simple model does not include a\ngaseous disk component nor star formation, which would\nnaturally lower the velocity dispersion; (2) while here we\nconsidered 2D disks, a significant fraction of the heating in the galactic disk plane would be transferred to the\nvertical direction, where GMC serve as scattering agents\n(Jenkins and Binney 1990; Jenkins 1992); and (3) in this\nwork we used constant parameters for both the MW bar\nand SS, but it is reasonable to expect more realistic scenarios, where throughout the lifetime of the Galaxy there\ncould have been variations of the perturbers' amplitudes\nand pattern speeds, bar size, spiral pitch angle, as well as\nbar destruction and reformation (Bournaud and Combes\n2002).\n7. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this work we have examined the combined effect of\na central bar and spiral structure on the radial migration\nin galactic disks. We have found that:\n(i) This new mechanism for galactic disk mixing could\nbe up to an order of magnitude more effective than the\ntransient spirals one (see Sec. 5.2). We note that the\neffect is non-linear, strongly dependent on the strengths\nof the perturbers. The non-linearity of the mechanism\nis confirmed by the fact that an increase in the amplitudes yields a much larger increase in the angular momentum changes in a simulation including both bar and\nspiral structure, compared to the case of a single perturber. In other words, the individual effects do not add\nup linearly. Another indication of non-linearity is that\nthe effect increases with time only in the case of the two\nperturbers propagating simultaneously.\n(ii) The signature of this mechanism is a bimodality in\nthe changes of angular momentum in the disk with maxima near the bar's corotation and its outer Lindblad resonance (see Figs. 5 and 6). This is true regardless of the\nspiral pattern speed and can be used in identifying the\nspiral-bar resonance overlap migration in N-body simulations, where the disk dynamics is much more complicated.\n(iii) For bar and spiral parameters consistent with Milky\nWay observations we find that it takes \u223c 3 Gyr to achieve\nthe mixing for which transients require 9 Gyr. In addition to radial mixing, spiral-bar coupling can account\nfor the age-velocity relation (AVR) observed in the solar\n\nneighborhood (Fig. 7, Sec. 6.3). Note however that the\nestimates for the Milky Way spiral and bar strengths derived from observations now may simply be irrelevant for\nour understanding of the current state of mixing in the\nGalactic disk (see Sec. 6).\n(iv) This mechanism could explain observations showing\nthat strongly barred galaxies have weaker metallicity gradients than weakly barred or non-barred galaxies (e.g.,\nZaritsky et al. 1994; Martin and Roy 1994; P\u00e9rez et al.\n2009).\nThe effect of resonance overlap we have described in\nthis paper appears to be quite strong. In order for it to\nwork, a galactic disk must contain a central bar2 . Unlike\nin our test-particle simulations, where the disk responds\nsolely to the bar potential, as seen in N-body simulations and deduced from observations, a bar is expected\nto always drive spiral structure (e.g., Salo et al. 2010).\nThus, any barred galaxy would be affected strongly by\nthis mechanism. As the disk heats and SS diminishes\nin strength, the effect on \u2206L will decrease. It is therefore likely that resonance overlap migration will be most\nvigorous at certain periods during a galaxy lifetime.\nIn this work we have only considered steady-state spirals in order to assess the pure effect of the coupling\nbetween bar and spiral structure. Considering transient spirals would increase the efficiency, since the SB02\nmechanism would come into play as well. Therefore, a\ncombination of a central bar and short-lived transients is\nexpected to be extremely efficient at mixing barred spiral\ngalaxies.\nAs discussed in Sec. 6, the most promising technique to put constraints on this mechanism in the MW\nis \"chemical tagging\" (Freeman and Bland-Hawthorn\n2002; Bland-Hawthorn et al. 2010) which will become possible with the forthcoming spectroscopic\nsurvey HERMES (Freeman and Bland-Hawthorn 2008;\nFreeman et al. 2010). More ongoing and planned large\nGalactic surveys, such as RAVE, SEGUE, SIM Lite,\nGYES, LAMOST and GAIA, can search for signatures\nof the mechanism (see also Minchev and Quillen 2008).\nIn a follow-up paper (Minchev et al. 2010b) we study\nthe effect of resonance overlap in fully self-consistent,\nTreeSPH/N-body simulations including a gaseous component and star formation. The migration mechanism\ndescribed in this paper can provide an explanation for\nthe observed flatness and spread in the age-metallicity\nrelation. Our results, however, need to be incorporated\ninto a chemo-dynamical galactic model to properly assess the effect on the AMR, and possibly also on the\nformation of the thick disk, similarly to the work by\nSch\u00f6nrich and Binney (2009).\nWe would like to thank Bruce Elmegreen, Ken Freeman, Arnaud Siebert, Jerry Sellwood, and James Binney for helpful communications and discussions. We\nalso thank the anonymous referee for valuable suggestion\nwhich have greatly improved the manuscript. Support\nfor this work was provided by ANR and RAVE.\n\n2 Note that resonance overlap, and thus migration, will also result from multiple spiral structure (Minchev et al. 2010b).\n\nREFERENCES\nAguerri, J.
