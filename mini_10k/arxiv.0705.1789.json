I NTRODUCTION\nUnder the classical networking paradigm, in which intermediate nodes are only allowed to store and forward packets,\ninformation security is usually viewed as an independent\nfeature with little or no relation to other communication tasks.\nIn fact, since intermediate nodes receive exact copies of the\nsent packets, data confidentiality is commonly ensured by\ncryptographic means at higher layers of the protocol stack.\nBreaking with the ruling paradigm, network coding allows\nintermediate nodes to mix information from different data\nflows [1], [2] and thus provides an intrinsic level of data\nsecurity - arguably one of the least well understood benefits\nof network coding.\nPrevious work on this issue has been mostly concerned\nwith constructing codes capable of spliting the data among\ndifferent links, such that reconstruction by a wiretapper is\neither very difficult or impossible. In [3], the authors present\na secure linear network code that achieves perfect secrecy\nagainst an attacker with access to a limited number of links.\nA similar problem is considered in [4], featuring a random\ncoding approach in which only the input vector is modified. [5] introduces a different information-theoretic security\nmodel, in which a system is deemed to be secure if an\neavesdropper is unable to get any decoded or decodable (also\ncalled meaningful) source data. Still focusing on wiretapping\nattacks, [6] provides a simple security protocol exploiting the\nnetwork topology: an attacker is shown to be unable to get any\nL. Lima (luisalima@ieee.org) and J.

Canonical Network Coding Example. In this image, intermediate nodes\nare represented with squares. With this code, node 4 is a vulnerability for\nthe network since it can decode all the information sent through it. Note\nthat the complete opposite happens for node 5, that receives no meaningful\ninformation whatsoever.\n\nmeaningful information unless it can access those links that\nare necessary for the communication between the legitimate\nsender and the receiver, who are assumed to be using network\ncoding. As a distributed capacity-achieving approach for the\nmulticast case, randomized network coding [7], [8] has been\nshown to extend naturally to packet networks with losses [9]\nand Byzantine modifications (both detection and correction\n[10], [11], [12], [13]). [14] adds a cost criterion to the secure\nnetwork coding problem, providing heuristic solutions for a\ncoding scheme that minimizes both the network cost and\nthe probability that the wiretapper is able to retrieve all the\nmessages of interest.\nIn this work, we approach network coding security from\na different angle: our focus is not on the threat posed by\nexternal wiretappers but on the more general threat posed\nby intermediate nodes. We assume that the network consists\nentirely of \"nice but curious\" nodes, i.e. they comply with\nthe communication protocols (in that sense, they are wellbehaved) but may try to acquire as much information as\npossible from the data that passes through them (in which case,\nthey are potentially malicious). This notion is highlighted in\nthe following example.\nExample 1: Consider the canonical network coding example with 7 nodes, shown in Figure 1. Node 1 sends a flow\nto sinks 6 and 7 through intermediate nodes 2, 3, 4 and 5.\nFrom the point of security, we can distinguish between three\ntypes of intermediate nodes in this setting: (1) those that only\nget a non-meaningful part of the information, such as node\n5; (2) those that obtain all of the information, such as node\n4; and (3) those that get partial yet meaningful information,\nsuch as nodes 2 and 3. Although this network code could be\nconsidered secure against single-edge external wiretapping -\ni.e. , the wiretapper is not able to retrieve the whole data simply\n\n\f2\n\nby eavesdropping on a single edge - it is clearly insecure\nagainst internal eavesdropping by an intermediate node.\nMotivated by this example, we set out to investigate the\nsecurity potential of network coding. Our main contributions\nare as follows:\n\u2022 Problem Formulation: We formulate a secure network\ncoding problem, in which all intermediate nodes are\nviewed as potential eavesdroppers and the goal is to\ncharacterize the intrinsic level of security provided by\nrandom linear network coding.\n\u2022 Algebraic Security Criterion: Based on the notion that the\nnumber of decodable bits available to each intermediate\nnode is limited by the degrees of freedom it receives, we\nare able to provide a natural secrecy constraint for network coding and to prove some of its most fundamental\nproperties.\n\u2022 Security Analysis for Complete Directed Acyclic Graphs:\nAs a preliminary step towards understanding the interplay\nbetween network topology and security against eavesdropping nodes, we present a rigorous characterization\nof the achievable level of algebraic security for this class\nof complete graphs.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. First, a\nformal problem statement is in Section II, followed by a detailed analysis of the algebraic security of Randomized Linear\nNetwork Coding in Section III. In Section IV, this analysis is\ncarried out specifically for complete directed acyclic graphs.\nThe paper concludes with Section V.\nII. P ROBLEM S ETUP\nWe adopt the network model of [2]: we represent the\nnetwork as an acyclic directed graph G = (V, E), where\nV is the set of nodes and E is the set of edges. Edges\nare denoted by round brackets e = (v, v 0 ) \u2208 E, in which\nv = head(e) and v 0 = tail(e). The set of edges that end at a\nvertex v \u2208 V is denoted by \u0393I (v) = {e \u2208 E : head(e) = v},\nand the in-degree of the vertex is \u03b4I (v) = |\u0393I (v)|; similarly,\nthe set of edges originating at a vertex v \u2208 V is denoted\nby \u0393O (v) = {e \u2208 E : tail(e) = v}, the out-degree being\nrepresented by \u03b4O (v) = |\u0393O (v)|.\nDiscrete random processes X1 , ...XK are observable at one\nor more source nodes. To simplify the analysis, we shall\nconsider that each network link is free of delays and that\nthere are no losses. Moreover, the capacity of each link is\none bit per unit time, and the random processes Xi have a\nconstant entropy rate of one bit per unit time. Edges with\nlarger capacities are modelled as parallel edges and sources\nof larger entropy rate are modelled as multiple sources at the\nsame node. We shall consider multicast connections as it is\nthe most general type of single connection; there are d \u2265 1\nreceiver nodes. The objective is to transmit all the source\nprocesses to each of the receiver nodes.\nIn linear network coding, edge e = (v, u) carries the process\nY (e), which is defined below:\nY (e) =\n\nX\nl:Xl generated at v\n\n\u03b1l,e X(v, l)+\n\nX\n\ne0 :head(e0 )=tail(e)\n\n\u03b2e0 ,e Y (e0 )\n\nThe transfer matrix M describes the relationship between\nan input vector x and an output vector z, z = xM ; M =\nA(I \u2212 F )\u22121 B T , where A and B represent, respectively, the\nlinear mixings of the input vector and of the output vector, and\nhave sizes K \u00d7 |E| and \u03bd \u00d7 |E|. F is the adjacency matrix\nof the directed labelled line graph corresponding to the graph\nG. In this paper we shall not consider matrix B, which only\nrefers to the decoding at the receivers. Thus, we shall mainly\nanalyse parts of the matrix AG, such that G = (I \u2212 F )\u22121 ;\nai and ci denote column i of A and AG, respectively. We\ndefine the partial transfer matrix M\u03930 I (v) (also called auxiliary\nencoding vector [9]) as the observable matrix at a given node\nv, i.e. the observed matrix formed by the symbols received at\na node v. This is equivalent to the fraction of the data that an\nintermediate node has access to in a multicast transmission.\nRegarding the coding scheme, we consider the random\nlinear network coding scheme introduced in [7]: and thus\neach coefficient of the matrices described above is chosen\nindependently and uniformly over all elements of a finite field\nFq , q = 2m .\nOur goal is to evaluate the intrinsic security of random\nlinear network coding, in multicast scenarios where all the\nintermediate nodes in the network are potentially malicious\neavesdroppers. Specifically our threat model assumes that\nintermediate nodes perform the coding operations as outlined\nabove, and will try to decode as much data as possible.\nIII. A LGEBRAIC S ECURITY OF R ANDOM L INEAR\nN ETWORK C ODING\nA. Algebraic security\nThe Shannon criterion for information-theoretic security [15] corresponds in general terms to a zero mutual\ninformation between the cypher-text (C) and the original\nmessage (M ), i.e. I(M ; C) = 0. This condition implies that\nan attacker must guess \u2264 H(M ) symbols to be able to\ncompromise the data. With network coding, on the other hand,\nif the attacker is capable of guessing M symbols, K \u2212 M\nadditional observed symbols are required for decoding - by\nnoting that each received symbol is a linear combination of\nthe K message symbols from the source, we can see that a\nreceiver must receive K coded symbols in order to recover one\nmessage symbol. Thus, as will be shown later, restricted rank\nsets of individual symbols do not translate into immediately\ndecodable data with high probability. This notion is illustrated\nin Figure 2. In the scheme shown on top, each intermediate\nnode can recover half of the transmitted symbols, whereas in\nthe bottom scheme none of the nodes can recover any portion\nof the sent data.\nDefinition 1 (Algebraic Security Criterion): The level of\nsecurity provided by random linear network coding is measured by the number of symbols that an intermediate node v\nhas to guess in order to decode one of the transmitted symbols.\nFrom a formal point of view,\n\u2206S (v) =\n\nK \u2212 (rank(M\u03930 I (v) ) + ld\nK\n\n,\n\n\f3\n\nFig. 2. Example of algebraic security. In the upper scheme data is not\nprotected, whereas in the lower scheme nodes 2 and 3 are unable to recover\nany data symbols.\n\nwhere ld represents the number of partially diagonalizable\nlines of the matrix (i.e. the number of message symbols that\ncan be recovered by Gaussian elimination).\nNotice that the previous definition is equivalent to computing the difference between the global rank of the code and\nthe local rank in each intermediate node v. Moreover, as more\nand more symbols become compromised of security criteria,\nthe level of security tends to 0, since as we shall show in\nthis section, with high probability the number of individually\ndecodable symbols ld goes to zero as the size of the field goes\nto infinity.\nB. Security Characterization\nWe are now ready to solve the problem of characterizing\nthe algebraic security of random linear network coding. The\nkey to our proofs is to analyze the properties of the partial\ntransfer matrix at each intermediate node. Recall that there are\ntwo cases in which the intermediate node can gain access to\nrelevant information: (1) when the partial transfer matrix has\nfull rank and (2) when the partial transfer matrix has diagonalizable parts. Thus, we shall carry out independent analyzes in\nterms of rank and in terms of partially diagonalizable matrices.\nThe following lemmas will be useful.\nLemma 1: In the random linear network coding scheme,\nP (\u2206S > 0) \u2264 P (\u2203v : \u03b4I (v) > K).\nProof: See the Appendix.\nIt follows from this lemma that it is only necessary to consider\nthe case in which K \u2264 \u03b4I (v).\nLemma 2: The probability that a linear combination of\nindependent and uniformly distributed values in Fq yields the\nzero result is bounded by\nP (Xlin = 0) \u2264\n\n2q + h(q)\n,\nq2\n\nwhere h(q) is a function such that O(h(q)) < O(q 2 ). Moreover, P (Xlin = 0) tends to 0 when q \u2192 \u221e.\nProof: See the Appendix.\nLemma 3: The probability of obtaining y zeros in one line\nof the \u03be \u00d7 \u03be transfer matrix M is bounded by\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013y \u0012\n\u0013\u03be\u2212y\n\u03be\n2q + h(q)\n2q + h(q)\nP (Y = y) \u2264\n1\u2212\n.\n\u03be\u2212y\nq2\nq2\n\nProof: See the Appendix.\nTheorem 1: Let P (ld > 0) be the probability of recovering\na strictly positive number of symbols ld at the intermediate\nnodes with \u03b4I (v) \u2264 K \u2212 1 by Gaussian elimination. Then,\nP (ld > 0) \u2192 0 with q \u2192 \u221e and K \u2192 \u221e.\nProof: Let M 0 be the transpose of the partial transfer\nmatrix at some vertex v, M 0 = M\u0393TI (v) . We consider the\nprocess of Gaussian elimination of M 0 . It is unnecessary\nto consider rank K, since in that case the matrix, w.h.p,\nis invertible and hence diagonalizable [8]. Thus, M 0 is a\n\u03b4I (v) \u00d7 K matrix, \u03b4I (v) < K.\nWe prove the theorem constructively by analysing the\nprobability of having K \u2212 1 zeros in one or more lines of\nM 0 . Let p be the probability of having K \u2212 1 zeros in a\nline of M 0 , and let X be a random variable representing the\nrecoverable number of symbols when an intermediate node\nhas \u03b4I (v) degrees of freedom. It follows from Lemma 3 that\n\u00131 \u0012\n\u0013K\u22121\n\u0013\u0012\n2q + h(q)\nK\n2q + h(q)\n.\n1\u2212\nq2\nq2\nK \u22121\n\n\u0012\np=\n\nIn the base case with \u03b4I (v) = 1, at most X = 1 symbols can\nbe recovered, since there are not enough degrees of freedom\nto perform Gaussian elimination and the only chance for\nrecovering a symbol is that the line of the matrix M already\nhas K \u2212 1 zeros.

In fact, there are two ways to obtain\na zero in a multiplication in Fq : (1) by multiplication between\nan element a \u2208 Fq and 0, and (2) by multiplication over two\nelements a \u2208 Fq and b \u2208 Fq , such that a 6= 0 and b 6= 0, but\nab = 0. Now, the total number of entries of the multiplicative\ntable between q elements of Fq is q 2 , and there are at most 2q\ninstances of the first case: q instances of ab = 0, a = 0 and\nb 6= 0, and q instances of ab = 0, a = 0 and b 6= 0. As for\nthe second case, it is possible to prove by contradiction that\nthe number of zeros obtained this way is strictly less than q 2 :\nif this was not the case, all products of elements of Fq would\nbe zero, and that is absurd. Since this is true for any q, the\nnumber of zeros grows O(h(q)) < O(q 2 ). Thus, we have\n2q + h(q)\n.\nq2\nSince for large enough q we have (2 + h(q))/q < 1, it follows\nthat\nP (Xlin = 0)q\u2192\u221e = 0.\nP (Xlin = 0) \u2264\n\n\u0004\nA PPENDIX\nProof of Lemma 1\nWe will prove this constructively in terms of the ranks of\nparts of the transfer matrix. The auxiliary encoding vector in\neach intermediate node v is given by\nM\u03930 I (v) = (A(I \u2212 F )\u22121 )\u0393I (v) ,\nwhere M\u03930 I (v) denotes the columns of the matrix corresponding to the incoming edges of v. The dimension of M\u03930 I (v) is\nK \u00d7 \u03b4I (v), with \u03b4I (v) < |E|.\nTo determine the rank of the partial transfer matrix, we note\nthat the transfer matrix M = A(I \u2212 F )\u22121 B T for the network\nmust be invertible, and hence, rank(M ) = K. On the other\nhand, to determine the rank of A(I \u2212 F )\u22121 we use the fact\nthat (I \u2212 F )\u22121 is invertible and thus rank((I \u2212 F )\u22121 ) = |E|.\nWe also have\nrank(A(I \u2212 F )\u22121 ) \u2264 |E|,\nbecause the dimension of A(I \u2212 F )\u22121 ) is K \u00d7 |E|. But, since\nrank(A(I \u2212 F )\u22121 B T ) = K = min(rank(A(I \u2212 F )\u22121 ), B)\nholds and K < |E| (true because K must be less than the\nminimum cut in the network) we conclude that\nrank(A(I \u2212 F )\u22121 ) = K.\nWe now consider \u2206S (v) at some vertex v. For that, we can\nconsider two distinct cases: the first one is if K < \u03b4I (v). In\nthis case, we cannot assume anything about \u2206S (v), since the\nrank of the matrix M\u03930 I (v) will be dependent on the topology\nof the network. As for the second case, rank(M\u03930 I (v) ) < K \u21d2\n\u2206S (v) < 0.\n\u0004\n\nProof of Lemma 3\nEach position of a line of the transfer matrix M is a linear\ncombination of independently and uniformly chosen values in\nFq , and thus, the probability of obtaining a zero in a position\nis given by Lemma 2. The result follows by considering all the\ncombinations of the possible positions in which the Y zeros\nmay occur.\n\u0004\nProof of Lemma 4\nSuppose that a given intermediate node receives R = K + \u03b8\nsymbols, \u03b8 \u2265 0. It is clear that the maximum possible rank is\nK and thus there is a way to remove \u03b8 columns s.t. the rank\nof the resulting set will still be at maximum K. Now consider\nthe case in which vertex v receives at most K symbols. If the\ncolumns are linearly dependent, the condition\n{xh1 ch1 + xh2 ch2 + ... + xhn chn = (0...0)T },\nsuch that xh1 , xh2 , ..., xhn not all 0, \u2208 Fq and h1 , h2 , ..., hn\nrepresent the columns \u2208 \u0393I (v), will be satisfied. Since the\nlinear combination of lines of the transfer matrix is again a\nlinear combination of independent and uniformly distributed\nvalues in Fq , it follows from Lemma 3 that the probability of\nobtaining (0...0)T tends to 0 when q \u2192 \u221e and K \u2192 \u221e,\nand thus, the columns h1 , h2 , ..., hn \u2208 \u0393I (v) are linearly\nindependent w.h.p.\n\u0004\nProof of Lemma 5\nIt follows from Lemma 4 that w.h.p., the number of symbols\nreceived by a vertex is the rank of the partial transfer matrix\nreceived (and at most K) and thus\nK \u2212 min(K, \u03b4I (v))\n=\n\u2206S (v) =\nK\nK \u2212 min(K, order(v) \u2212 1)\nK\n\u0004\n\n\f"}
