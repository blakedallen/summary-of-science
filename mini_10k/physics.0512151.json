Introduction\nThe field of atom optics [1] has undergone a dramatic expansion in the last two decades,\nlargely as a consequence of the development of laser-cooling techniques [2], and the\nroutine production of atoms at microKelvin temperatures [3]. Paramagnetic cold\natoms can be manipulated with the Stern-Gerlach force [4]. To date, the Stern-Gerlach\nforce has been used to realise a variety of atomic mirrors for both cold [5] and Bose\ncondensed atoms [6]. This paper, however, concentrates on the formation of magnetic\nlenses for cold atoms. In comparison to a ballistically expanding unfocused cloud, a\nmagnetically focused cloud can lead to density increases (or conversely temperature\ndecreases) of many orders of magnitude. Applications include: atom lithography [7];\ntransferring cold atoms from a Magneto Optical Trap (MOT) to a remote vacuum\nchamber of lower background pressure [8]; cold low-density atomic sources for fountain\nclocks [9].\nThe first demonstration of 3D focusing with pulsed magnetic lenses was conducted\nby Cornell et al. [10]. The group of Gorceix have made experimental and theoretical\nstudies of cold atom imaging by means of pulsed magnetic fields [11, 12]. However,\nneither work addressed the optimum strategy for achieving a compact focused cloud,\nnor the limiting features for the quality of their atom-optical elements.\nRecently we provided a theoretical analysis of 3D focusing of weak-field-seeking\ncold atoms using a single magnetic pulse [13]. Lens designs for 1D and 3D were\npresented that minimise aberrations due to the lens potential's departure from the\n\n\fDouble-impulse magnetic focusing of launched cold atoms\n\n2\n\nperfect parabolic case. Single-impulse 3D focusing has been experimentally achieved at\nDurham University, the results of which can be seen in a forthcoming publication [14].\nThe scope of this paper is to investigate theoretically and numerically the limiting\nfactors to the quality and size of the final image obtained in double-impulse magnetic\nfocusing experiments; to identify the sources of aberration; and to discuss schemes\nfor minimising their effect. We will show that both single- and double-impulse lenses\nyield a magnetically focused cloud with a bimodal distribution consisting of a highly\ndiffuse outer cloud, as well as a core cloud which can be orders of magnitude denser\nthan the initial atomic sample. This core cloud is therefore ideal for remotely loading\ntight traps with relatively small depth, e.g. miniature magnetic guides [15], atom\nchips [4, 16] and optical dipole traps [17].\nThe remainder of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 outlines the theory of\nhow to achieve the desired magnetic fields; Section 3 contains an analysis of magnetic\nimaging and minimising the final cloud size; Section 4 describes and contrasts the\nspatial performance of different magnetic lenses; Section 5 considers experimentally\nrelevant parameters for alternate gradient lenses; Section 6 contains a discussion and\nconcluding remarks.\n2. Alternate-gradient lens theory\nAn atom in a magnetic field of magnitude B experiences a magnetic dipole interaction\nenergy of U = \u2212\u03bc\u03b6 B, where \u03bc\u03b6 is the projection of the atom's magnetic moment onto\nthe field direction. Provided that Majorana spin-flip transitions [18] occuring in field\nzeros are avoided and the rate of change of direction of the field is less than the Larmor\nfrequency the magnetic moment adiabatically follows the field.\nThe Stern-Gerlach force is F~SG = \u2212\u2207U = \u2207(\u03bc\u03b6 B). The ensemble (of alkali metal\natoms) can be optically pumped into either a strong-field-seeking state with \u03bc\u03b6 = \u03bcB\n(where \u03bcB is the Bohr magneton), or into a weak-field-seeking state with \u03bc\u03b6 = \u2212\u03bcB .\nIn low field, where the quantum numbers F and mF are good, these states are the\nstretched states |F = I + 1/2, mF = \u00b1F i. Atoms in these states have a magnetic\nmoment which is independent of field, consequently the Stern-Gerlach force takes the\nsimpler form F~SG = \u00b1\u03bcB \u2207B - i.e. the focusing of the atoms is governed by the\ngradient of the magnetic field magnitude only.\nThe choice of whether atoms in weak or strong-field seeking states are launched\ndepends on the particular application. We discussed extensively in [13] the focusing\nof atoms in weak-field-seeking states. This was because single-impulse 3D imaging\nof strong-field-seeking states requires a maximum of the magnetic field in free space,\nwhich is forbidden by Earnshaw's theorem [19].\nIn this paper magnetic lenses centred on the point {0, 0, zc } are considered, with\na second order magnetic field magnitude of the form:\n\u0001\nB2\n(1)\n\u2212x2 /2 \u2212 y 2 /2 + (z \u2212 zc )2 .\nB(x, y, z) = B0 +\n2\nB0 and B2 are the bias field and the field curvature, respectively. Substituting this\ninto the Stern-Gerlach force expression results in an atom of mass m experiencing a\nharmonic acceleration about {0, 0, zc } :\n2\n\na = \u2212\u03c9 2 {\u2212x/2, \u2212y/2, (z \u2212 zc )},\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c9 = \u03bc\u03b6 B2 /m is a measure of the power of the lens. The axial curvature is\ntwice the magnitude of, and opposite in sign to, the radial curvature, \u03c9z 2 = \u22122\u03c9r2 .\n\n\fDouble-impulse magnetic focusing of launched cold atoms\n\n3\n\nNote that lens curvature in all three spatial dimensions is reversed if the sign of either\n\u03bc\u03b6 or B2 is reversed. For simplicity from this point on, only the case \u03bc\u03b6 = \u2212\u03bcB i.e.\nweak-field-seeking atoms will be used and lens curvature is modified solely via B2 .\nWe refer to a lens with a field expansion of the form B as a one-dimensional lens,\nas it can be used either to focus axially (with simultaneous radial defocusing), when\nB2 is positive, or to focus radially (with simultaneous axial defocusing) when B2 is\nnegative. In order to achieve a 3D focus with the lenses of equation (2), an axially\nconverging lens pulse must be followed by an appropriately timed axially diverging\nlens (or vice versa). This is referred to as the \"alternate gradient\" focusing method,\nand has the advantage of being able to focus both weak-field and strong-field seeking\natoms. This method is used extensively in particle accelerators [20], for focusing\npolar molecules [21], and is shown schematically in Figure 1. Useful parameters for\ndescribing the evolution of a Gaussian atomic cloud are the axial (\u03c3z ) and radial (\u03c3r )\nrms cloud radii (the standard deviations), as well as their aspect ratio \u03be = \u03c3z /\u03c3r .\n\nFigure 1.\nThe principle of alternate gradient focusing. The upper image,\nStrategy AR, shows the evolution of the axial (\u03c3z , green) and radial (\u03c3r , black)\ncloud radii when an axially converging (radially diverging) lens precedes an axially\ndiverging (radially converging) lens and leads to a sausage-shaped cloud (\u03be > 1).\nIn the lower image, Strategy RA, the lens order is reversed, leading to a pancakeshaped cloud (\u03be < 1). The effects of gravity (in the \u2212z direction along the coil\naxis) are not shown, but are included in simulations. Due to the time reversal\nsymmetry of optics, the lens system also works backwards.\n\nAs shown in reference [13] there exist optimal configurations for realising radial\nand axial focusing lenses. These are achieved with a pair of separated coaxial coils,\nwhere both coils have equal current with the same sense. An important lens parameter\nis the relative separation S of the coils in units of the coil radius. The harmonicity\nof a radially-focusing lens is optimized if S = 0.58 (red lenses in Figure 1); whereas\nthe harmonicity of an axially-focusing lens is optimized if S = 2.63 (blue lenses in\nFigure 1). In the remainder of this work it is assumed that these optimized lenses are\nused.\n\n\fDouble-impulse magnetic focusing of launched cold atoms\n\n4\n\n3. Magnetic impulses and the ABCD formalism\nThe separable equations of motion for an axially and cylindrically symmetric coil\nsystem lead to a lens that is harmonic in 3D with an acceleration given by equation\n(2), which allows the motion in each cartesian dimension to be treated as a separate\nsimple harmonic equation. The influence of a magnetic lens can be described by ABCD\nmatrices, as outlined in [12, 13]. The initial and final position and velocity of an atom\nalong a given Cartesian axis, say x, are related via the equation:\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\nxf\nA B\nxi\n=\n.\n(3)\nvxf\nC D\nvxi\nA 'thick' converging lens of strength \u03c9 (with Im(\u03c9) = 0) and physical duration \u03c4\nis actually equivalent to the 'thin' lens ABCD transformation:\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1 \u03c4 \u2032 /2\n1 0\n1 \u03c4 \u2032 /2\ncos(\u03c9\u03c4 )\n\u03c9 sin(\u03c9\u03c4 )\n=\n, (4)\n\u2212\u03c9 sin(\u03c9\u03c4 ) cos(\u03c9\u03c4 )\n0\n1\nC 1\n0\n1\nwhere C(\u03c9, \u03c4 ) = \u2212\u03c9 sin(\u03c9\u03c4 ), and is pre- and post-multiply by a translation matrix of\nhalf the effective pulse width \u03c4 \u2032 (\u03c9, \u03c4 ) = \u03c92 tan( \u03c9\u03c4\n2 ). The notation of primes is used to\ndenote times in the 'thin' lens representation. To model a diverging lens make the\ntransformation \u03c9 \u2192 \u00b1i\u03c9 in equation (4) \u2013 i.e. C = \u03c9 sinh(\u03c9\u03c4 ) and \u03c4 \u2032 = \u03c92 tanh \u03c9\u03c4\n2 .\nThe 'equivalent time' of the lens \u03c4 \u2032 is not the same as the real experimental pulse\nduration of \u03c4 .\n3.1. Double impulse magnetic lenses - the parabolic case\nA double lens system, see Figure 2, comprising lenses of strength and duration \u03c91 , \u03c41\n(starting after a time t1 ) and \u03c92 , \u03c42 (starting a time t2 after the first lens) is modelled\nby using the following ABCD matrix sequence:\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\nA B\n1 t\u20323\n1 0\n1 t\u20322\n1 0\n1 t\u20321\n=\n,\n(5)\nC D\n0 1\nC2 1\n0 1\nC1 1\n0 1\n\ni.e. a t\u20321 = t1 + 12 \u03c41\u2032 translation, then a strength C1 thin lens, a t\u20322 = 21 \u03c41\u2032 + t2 + 12 \u03c42\u2032\ntranslation, then a strength C2 thin lens followed by a t\u20323 = T \u2032 \u2212 t\u20321 \u2212 t\u20322 translation,\n\u03c9 \u03c4\nwhere Cj = \u2212\u03c9j sin(\u03c9j \u03c4j ) and \u03c4j\u2032 = \u03c92j tan( j2 j ) for j \u2208 {1, 2}. The total physical\nduration of the focusing, T, is fixed, and the effective total time of the double lens\nsystem is T \u2032 = T \u2212 \u03c41 \u2212 \u03c42 + \u03c41\u2032 + \u03c42\u2032 .\nBy multiplying the matrices of equation (5) together, the final ABCD system\nmatrix is obtained. An image (i.e. a one-to-one map of position between the initial\nand final cloud) is formed if the condition B = 0 is maintained. In this case the\nspatial magnification A is the inverse of the velocity magnification D; a manifestation\nof Liouville's theorem. The cloud extent along x in a given plane is given by:\n\u03c3x2f = (A\u03c3xi )2 + (B\u03c3vxi )2 ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03c3xi is the initial position standard deviation and \u03c3vxi is the initial velocity\nstandard deviation. An image is formed for the condition B = 0, but the smallest\ncloud size occurs when one minimises the product of the cloud extent for all 3 spatial\ndimensions (i.e. \u03c3rf 2 \u03c3zf ). For single- and double-impulse lens systems, the cloud size\nat the image plane and the minimum cloud size do not correspond exactly, but they\nare usually very similar. In the rest of the paper we will consider the cloud size at the\nimage plane (B = 0), and thus A corresponds to the magnification.\n\n\f5\n\nDouble-impulse magnetic focusing of launched cold atoms\nb) Thin lenses\n\na) Thick lenses\nTranslation\n\nt3\n\nTranslation\n\nt2\n\nt2\n\nTranslation\n\nTranslation\n\nTranslation\n\nt'2\n\nt'1\n\nt'3\n\nt1\n\nt1\n\nTranslation\n\nT'\n\nT\nTime\n\nFigure 2.

Moreover, the radial (subscript r) and\naxial (subscript z) spatial dimensions have different A and B coefficients.

A 3D image is formed when equation (8) is set equal to zero for both\nthe radial and axial directions.\nIn reference [13] the density increase from a single-impulse isotropic 3D harmonic\nlens, \u03bb3 /(1 \u2212 \u03bb)3 , was characterised by \u03bb, the equivalent time of the thin lens, t1 \u2032 ,\nrelative to the total equivalent focus time T \u2032 . Note that for the anisotropic lenses\nin this paper the equivalent (i.e. thin lens) timing of a lens in the radial and axial\ndirection is different. For this reason we will characterise alternate-gradient lensing\nwith the parameters {\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 } = {t1 + \u03c41 /2, t1 + \u03c41 + t2 + \u03c42 /2}/T, corresponding to the\nmean times of the first and second magnetic impulses relative to the total experimental\nlensing time T. We use this labelling of {\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 } if \u03c91r is real (the first lens is radially\nconverging), and we swap the definitions of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 if \u03c91r is imaginary (the first\nlens is radially diverging).\nModelling an experiment being conducted at Durham University [14], we fix\nT = 212 ms. The cold atom cloud has an isotropic initial spatial and velocity\ndistribution with 1D standard deviations of \u03c3R = 0.4 mm and \u03c3V = 4.4 cm/s (i.e.\na temperature of 20 \u03bcK) respectively. The coils are assumed to have a 4 cm radius\nwith 10,000 Amp-turn current in each coil. The two lens combinations in Figure 1 are\nshown in the table below with the resulting angular frequencies.\nFor a range of values of \u03c41 , and \u03c42 , we then solve the radial and axial simultaneous\nequations (8) (i.e. Br = 0, Bz = 0) to determine t1 and t2 . Although both Bz and\nBr are quadratic in t1 and t2 , substitution for either of these variables leads to a final\n\n\f6\n\nDouble-impulse magnetic focusing of launched cold atoms\nStrategy\nAR\nRA\n\n1st lens\nAxial focus\nRadial focus\n\n\u03c91r\n58i rad s\u22121\n97 rad s\u22121\n\nS1\n2.63\n0.58\n\n2nd lens\nRadial focus\nAxial focus\n\n\u03c92r\n97 rad s\u22121\n58i rad s\u22121\n\nS2\n0.58\n2.63\n\n\u03be\n>1\n<1\n\nTable 1.

This must therefore be solved numerically and leads to\nsix solution pairs (t1 , t2 ). Only solution pairs with real times 0 \u2264 t1 , t2 \u2264 T satisfying\nthe condition t1 + \u03c41 + t2 + \u03c42 \u2264 T are considered. The number of (t1 , t2 ) solution\npairs as a function of \u03c41 and \u03c42 is shown in Figure 3(a). These (t1 , t2 ) solution pairs\ncan then be used to calculate the relative increase in atomic density of a cold atom\ncloud.

The dimensionless relative density\nincreases obtained for both strategies are shown in Figure 3(b,c). These plots are\nthen effectively combined in Figure 3(d) by inverting \u03c41 , \u03c42 to find the relative density\nincrease as a function of the parameters \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 which are the mean relative times of\nthe radially diverging and converging lens.\n4. A measure of the quality of the focus\nThe attributes of parabolic lenses are unimportant, unless it can be shown that\nexperimentally realistic lenses are sufficiently parabolic for such an approximation\nto be appropriate. At the end of [13] there appeared to be a major difference between\nthe parabolic approximation and real lenses. To some extent, this may have been due\nto the way the lens properties were measured.\nIn [13] numerical integration of the forces arising from the magnetic fields due to\ncurrent loops (generated by the Biot-Savart law) was used, to track the trajectories\nof several (\u2248 1000) simulated atoms. The initial positions and velocities of the atoms\nwere randomly assigned, weighted according to isotropic Gaussian spatial and velocity\ndistributions with 1D standard deviations of \u03c3R = 0.4 mm and \u03c3V = 4.4 cm/s (as\ndiscussed in the previous section). The way in which the harmonicity of a lens was\nmeasured was to compare the expected harmonic focus size to the rms radii of the\nsimulated atom cloud at the time of the harmonic focus. The important drawback of\nthis rms approach is that the final location of atoms after a magnetic lens is highly\nnonlinear with respect to initial conditions. An atom with a velocity in the wings of\nthe initial Gaussian distribution will experience highly anharmonic lensing, as it will\nbe far from the centre of the lens during the magnetic impulse. Thus a few atoms can\ncompletely alter the rms width of the cloud.\nAnother method to quantify the focus, adopted here, is to monitor the fraction\nof the atoms entering the focus region of a purely harmonic lens. The initial radial\nand axial cloud standard deviations are \u03c3R , so the final standard deviations for a\nharmonic lens are \u03c3r = Ar \u03c3R and \u03c3z = Az \u03c3R .

The two dashed regions of the 'solution island' lead to the\nhighest relative density increases, shown in (b) and (c). The relative density\nincrease (equation (9)) if one images a cloud of atoms using: (b) Strategy AR, (c)\nStrategy RA. The maximum relative density increases are 1100 (320), for a \u03be = 17\nsausage (\u03be = 0.094 pancake) shaped cloud, for images (b) and (c) respectively.\nThe results of (b) and (c) are combined in (d), the relative density increase in terms\nof \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 (the mean times of the radially converging and radially diverging\nimpulses relative to T ).

For numerical\n\n\fDouble-impulse magnetic focusing of launched cold atoms\n\n8\n\nsimulations the fraction of atoms entering this harmonic focus is measured, and\nmultiplied by twice the relative density increase of a purely harmonic lens (i.e.\n2Ar \u22122 Az \u22121 ) to get a measure of the relative density increase afforded by a real lens.\nNote that the centre of the harmonic focus region, as well as the centre about\nwhich the rms radius is defined, is the final position of an atom initially in the\ncentre of the Gaussian position and velocity distributions. This will lead to a slight\nunderestimation in the density increase regardless of which way it is defined (it has\nbeen assumed the mean cloud position follows the initial centre-of-mass). In addition\nthe density can increase if the best experimental 3D focus occurs at a time other than\nthe best parabolic lens focus time, but the focus time has been allowed to vary in the\nsimulations. For more details on the effects of gravity on launched atoms, namely that\neven the centre-of-mass atoms will experience time-varying radial and axial harmonic\ntrap frequencies, see the Appendix.\n4.1. Single-impulse focusing revisited\nIn light of the above discussion, 3D single-impulse focusing outlined in [13] is briefly\nrevisited, in particular Strategy VI: the baseball coil system. This system consisted\nof a square baseball coil with side lengths w and a coil pair of radius w separated by\nw that were coaxial with the baseball coil axis. The current in the baseball coil was\n10, 000 Amp-turns, and an isotropic lens is formed when the coil pair has a current\nof 1, 541 Amp-turns. In this paper we have made the value w = 4 cm, leading to\nan angular frequency \u03c9 = 62 rad/s in the harmonic lens. This is to provide a better\ncomparison between single- and double-impulse techniques.\nIn Figure 4 the relative density increase after the baseball lens is plotted in terms\nof the parameter \u03bb (the effective time of the baseball lens relative to T ). The red\ndots correspond to the relative density increase using rms widths for the volume. The\nblue dots show the relative density increase as the fraction of atoms in the harmonic\nfocus zone times the harmonic density increase. It is clear that we reach very different\nconclusions based on whether the rms radius of the focused atomic cloud, or the\nfraction of atoms which reach the harmonic focus are considered.\nBy only looking at rms widths the optimum lens position occurs at \u03bb = 0.3,\ncorresponding to a factor of 50 decrease in density. However considering the fraction\nof atoms in the harmonic focus zone times the harmonic density increase, the optimum\nposition is now \u03bb = 0.9. The relative density increase is 2.3, which corresponds to\n0.3% of the cloud focused to a density 729 times greater than it was originally.\nThe source of this discrepancy between methods can be seen in Figure 4 (b-c)\nwhere the non-Gaussian wings produce an over estimate of the rms cloud width. The y\nand z standard deviations for the Gaussian fits (black curves) are 730 \u03bcm and 820 \u03bcm\nrespectively; an almost isotropic distribution.\n4.2. Alternate gradient\nThis section compares the alternate gradient numerical simulations with the purely\nharmonic lenses of section 3. The (\u03c41 , \u03c42 ) sample co-ordinates illustrated in Figure 3(bc) are used, in order to run numerical simulations for the relative density increases\nillustrated in Figure 5. We have not (cf. Figure 4) used the rms volume of the cloud\nto show the relative density increases as these result in extremely low relative density\n\n\f9\n\n10\n\n0.4\n\nHaL\n\n2\n\n101\n100\n10-1\n\n0.2\n\n0\n0\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\n\u039b\n\n1\n\n-6 -4 -2 0 2\nyHmmL\n\n0.35\n0.3\n0.25\n0.2\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n-6 -4 -2 0 2\nzHmmL\n\nHcL\n\n0.1\n\n10-2\n10-3\n\n0.3\n\nHbL\nPz Hmm-1 L\n\n103\nPy Hmm-1 L\n\nRelative density incr.\n\nDouble-impulse magnetic focusing of launched cold atoms\n\n4\n\n6\n\n4\n\n6\n\nFigure 4. Image (a) shows the relative density increase (with error bars, for\na 5000 atom simulation) based on: a purely harmonic lens (black curve), the\nfraction of atoms in a real lens arriving at the harmonic focus region (blue dots),\nthe ratio of rms cloud volume before and after a real lens (red dots). Images (b)\nand (c) show the spatial probability distributions at the focus (black dots) in the\ny and z directions, respectively, where the non-Gaussian wings of the distribution\ncan be clearly seen. These two distributions are taken from the \u03bb = 0.5 lens\nsimulation, in which case 16% of the atoms are in the harmonic focus region. The\nGaussian fits in (b) and (c) (as well as the x distribution) have an area of \u2248 70%.\n\nincreases (typically 10\u22125 in (a) and 10\u22123 in (b)) that would reduce the contrast in\nFigure 5.\nFor both strategies the numerical simulations trace the shape of the analytical\nrelative density increase although aberrations result in reduced increases. The\nmaximum relative density increases in (a) and (b) are 186 and 50 respectively. This is\na marked improvement on the single-impulse focusing, however the cloud distribution\nis no longer isotropic. The harmonic focus aspect ratio has a range 12 \u2264 \u03be \u2264 17 in (a)\nand 0.074 \u2264 \u03be \u2264 0.095 in (b).\nIn certain applications, for example microtrap loading and lithography, the\nsausage-shaped distribution with its reduced radial spread could be beneficial. Figure 5\n(c) plots the distribution of a cloud focused via Strategy AR. The standard deviations\nfor the Gaussian fits to the core of the x, y, and z distributions are 56 \u03bcm, 56 \u03bcm\nand 850 \u03bcm; an order of magnitude reduction in the radial direction compared with\nsingle-impulse focusing.\nGiven comparable lens dimensions and strengths, double-impulse magnetic\nfocusing is far superior to single-impulse magnetic focusing in terms of the relative\ndensity increases that can be achieved by a fraction of the atoms. This result is in\nstark contrast to the relative rms density increase of the entire cloud, which would lead\nto the opposite conclusion. This spatial focusing would find applications in lithography\nor sending the atomic cloud through micro-sized apertures.\n5. Physical properties of clouds focused via the alternate gradient method\nFor many experiments it is also important to consider changes to the velocity\ndistribution and hence the collision rate and phase-space density. Unless the collision\nrate of a gas is sufficiently high, then Bose-Einstein condensation via sustainable\nevaporative cooling is impossible. Changes in the collision rate and phase-space\ndensity of the focused cloud are complicated by the fact that alternate-gradient lensing\n\n\f10\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\nHaL\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nSample Number\n\n103\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n101\n\nHbL\nPx Hmm-1 L\n\n103\n\nRelative density incr.\n\nRelative density incr.\n\nDouble-impulse magnetic focusing of launched cold atoms\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nSample Number\n\nHcL\n100\n10-1\n-0.6-0.3 0 0.3 0.6\nx HmmL\n\nFigure 5.\nImages (a) and (b) use the (\u03c41 , \u03c42 ) co-ordinates illustrated in\nFigure 3(b) and (c) to show the relative density increase for alternate gradient\nlensing Strategies AR and RA, respectively. There were 1000 atoms in the\nsimulation and relative density increases are shown for a pure harmonic lens (black\ncurve), as well as the relative density increase for the fraction of atoms in a real\nlens arriving at the harmonic focus region (blue dots with error bars). In image\n(c) the strong spatial bimodal nature of the x focus for the leftmost point in (a)\nis clearly seen on a log scale. The Gaussian fit (with \u03c3x = 56 \u03bcm) contains 49%\nof the 3000 simulated atoms used in (c).\n\nautomatically leads to an anisotropic focused distribution both in space and in velocity.\nAt the Br,z = 0 focus of the cloud the ABCDr,z matrix has radial and axial spatial\nwidths \u03c3r = hr2 i1/2 = Ar \u03c3R and \u03c3z = hz 2 i1/2 = Az \u03c3R respectively. The radial and\naxial velocity widths are given by:\nq\nq\nq\n(11)\nhvr,z 2 i = kB Tr,z /m = Cr,z 2 \u03c3R 2 + \u03c3V 2 /Ar,z 2 ,\n\nwhere Tr,z is the atomic cloud temperature. In the limit Cr,z \u03c3R \u226a \u03c3V /Ar,z (which is\nnot always the case), thepvelocity width of the focused cloud is inversely proportional\nto its spatial width and hvr,z 2 i = \u03c3V /Ar,z . In Figure 6 phase-space plots of the AR\nand RA strategies from the rightmost points of Figures 5 (a) and (b) were generated\nwith a 30,000 atom simulation. The effect of aberration is clearly seen when comparing\nthe purely harmonic lenses (subscript H) and the Monte Carlo simulation with the\nfull magnetic fields from realistic coils (subscript MC). The plots also demonstrate the\ninversely proportional relationship between spatial and velocity widths. Furthermore,\nin the Monte Carlo simulations there is much stronger correlation between position\nand velocity.\nThe anisotropic temperature in the focused cloud means that captured atoms in\na cylindrically symmetric harmonic trap with radial and axial frequencies \u03bdr and\n\u03bdz , will rethermalise to an isotropic temperature via elastic collisions. The total\n(potential+kinetic) energy of the focused cloud is equated with that of a 3D harmonic\noscillator at equilibrium temperature T (i.e. 12 kB T average energy per atom for each\nspace and velocity dimension). The equilibrium temperature of the focused cloud after\nthermalisation is thus:\n\u0001\nm\n4\u03c0 2 (2\u03bdr 2 hr2 i + \u03bdz 2 hz 2 i) + (2hvr 2 i + hvz 2 i) .\n(12)\nT =\n6kB\nIn many experiments other physical properties of the\u221aatomic cloud are of interest:\nthe atomic density n \u221d 1/(\u03c3r 2 \u03c3z ), collision rate \u03b3 \u221d n T and phase-space density\nPSD \u221d n/(Tr Tz 1/2 ).

Both a harmonic lens calculation\n(subscript H) and a Monte Carlo simulation with the full magnetic fields from\nrealistic coils (subscript MC) are plotted. In the ARMC plot there are 45% (x\u2212vx )\nand 42% (z \u2212 vz ) of the initial 30,000 atoms present. In the RAMC plot there are\n61% (x \u2212 vx ) and 24% (z \u2212 vz ) of the atoms present. The effects of aberration\nare clearly seen when comparing the harmonic and realistic magnetic coils.\n\nthermalisation of the focused cloud, one can show that it is best to choose \u03bdr and \u03bdz\nsuch that the potential energy is equal in all spatial dimensions and the total potential\nenergy is equal to the total kinetic energy of the cloud.\nThe physical properties of the focused atomic clouds of Figure 6 are displayed\nin Table 2. The relative values for the density n, collision rate \u03b3 and phase-space\ndensity can be converted into absolute values using typical initial experimental values\nhni = 1010 cm\u22123 (an atom number N = 3 \u00d7 107 in the unfocused cloud), \u03b3 = 1 Hz (for\n87\nRb with the low-temperature collision cross-section \u03c3 = 8\u03c0a2 = 8 \u00d7 10\u221212 cm2 ) and\nphase-space density PSD=2 \u00d7 10\u22126 . Aberrations will effectively be smaller if a large\nMOT is used with the same density (e.g. N = 109 , \u03c3R = 1.3 mm) and temperature as\nTable 2, and a trap with weaker frequencies to catch the atoms.\nNote that the Monte Carlo relative density increases in Table 2 are lower than\nthose in Figure 5 by a factor of \u2248 2, but the fraction of atoms in the focus are higher\nby a factor of \u2248 2. In Figure 5 the density is estimated by measuring the fraction of\natoms arriving at the harmonic focus. Here, a 6-dimensional Gaussian phase-space fit\nto the narrow central peak of the bimodal focus was made to explicitly obtain \u03c3r , \u03c3z ,\nTr and Tz . The fraction of atoms in this Gaussian focus was used for P here.\nAn interesting result of Table 2 is that the aberrations of 'real' lenses work to our\nadvantage, to some extent, in that the atoms can be loaded into a trap with a shallower\ndepth than atoms focused by a purely harmonic lens, and phase-space density loss is\nreduced during rethermalisation. This is due to the reduced anisotropy of the spatial\nand velocity distributions at the focus. The focused atoms have a relatively high\ntemperature and one needs a trap depth of \u2248 10 mK to trap the focused atoms.

Discussion and conclusion\nThe main application of interest for the magnetically imaged atoms will be loading\na magnetic microtrap or optical dipole trap, for which alternate gradient imaging is\nwell-suited. If the trap that is being loaded is harmonic, with a large capture volume,\nthen the rms size of the cloud will be linked to the equilibrium temperature after elastic\ncollisions rethermalise the initially bimodal image distribution. In order to keep the\nhigh density core of the atomic cloud, the high energy atoms must be removed on a\ntime scale that is rapid compared to rethermalisation - this could be achieved with\nstrong RF evaporative cooling or by shining resonant dark SPOT beams [22] at the\nfocal region. A trap with a small capture volume, e.g. an atom chip [16] or a focused\noptical dipole beam trap [17], is ideal as only the high density core of atoms will be\ncaptured in the trap.\nThe timescale needed to remove the shell of hot diffuse atoms from the central core\nwill actually be much longer than the time it takes for the dense core atoms (which are\nanisotropically focused in space and velocity) to thermalise to a uniform temperature\nin 3D. The higher the anisotropy of the focused atomic cloud, the more phase space\ndensity is lost during the thermalisation. This loss could be mitigated to some extent\nif the radial and axial trap frequencies were varied to remain in equilibrium with the\nchanging radial and axial cloud temperatures during the (short) thermalisation time.\nIn this paper we have used experimentally realistic parameters to compare the\nlimiting focal size of a launched cold cloud of weak-field seeking atoms subject to\n\n\fDouble-impulse magnetic focusing of launched cold atoms\n\n13\n\neither a single or double magnetic lens impulse. The ABCD matrix formalism was\nconvenient for giving an estimate as to the parameters needed for magnetic focusing,\nbut numerical simulations were necessary to detect the effects of aberrations in real\nmagnetic lenses. If one wishes to minimise the rms image volume of a launched cloud\nthen a single-impulse lens is preferable. If, however, one can selectively capture the\ncentral core of the bi-modal image, a double-impulse (alternate gradient) lens can lead\nto orders of magnitude relative density increases for both pancake- and sausage-shaped\nimage clouds. Although we have only considered cold thermal atomic clouds in this\npaper, the effects of aberrations will also be important for tight focusing of coherent\nmatter waves [6, 23].\nAcknowledgments\nThis work is supported by EPSRC, the UKCAN network and Durham University.

In experiments the lens strength is a function\nof time, partly because the current in a real coil is not a top-hat pulse, and partly\nbecause the centre-of-mass of a launched atomic cloud changes as it goes through a\nlens and thus (to second order in position) will experience a time-varying parabolic\nlens. In practice it was unnecessary to adjust the timing or lens coil positions to allow\nfor these effects in the simulations, however we briefly discuss ways around this issue\nshould it become problematic.\nA harmonic lens with arbitrary time variation \u03c9(t) (where \u03c9(t) and its derivatives\nare zero outside the experimental pulse time t1 \u2264 t \u2264 t1 +\u03c41 ), is equivalent to an infinite\nproduct of infinitesimal 2 \u00d7 2 translation and thin lens matrices, resulting in a single\n2 \u00d7 2 matrix that is itself independent of the initial velocity and position of an atom.\nOn solving y \u2032\u2032 [t] = \u2212\u03c9 2 [t]y[t] from t = t1 to t = t1 + \u03c41 , with the initial conditions\n{y[t1 ], y \u2032 [t1 ]} = {dy, 0} to get {y[t1 + \u03c41 ], y \u2032 [t1 + \u03c41 ]} = {A, C}dy, then use initial\nconditions {y[t1 ], y \u2032 [t1 ]} = {0, dv} to get {y[t1 + \u03c41 ], y \u2032 [t1 + \u03c41 ]} = {B, D}dv, (with\nsmall values for dy and dv) results in the general ABCD matrix for any initial position\nand velocity from (numerically or analytically) solving the differential equation for\nonly two different initial conditions. As this ABCD matrix has determinant 1 (it is a\nproduct of determinant 1 matrices) it can be expressed as a (translation matrix)-(thin\nlens)-(translation matrix) combination.\nOne can then use an iterative 4D Newton-Raphson method with four input\nparameters (the z positions of the two alternate gradient lenses and the times t1\nand t2 ) such that the z centre-of-mass velocity of the atoms is not altered by either\nlens, and Br and Bz are identical to zero.\nReferences\n[1] Adams C S, Sigel M and Mlynek J 1994 Phys.
