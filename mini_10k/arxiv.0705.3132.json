Prominent examples are the passive scalar advection and statistical conservation laws (see e.g. Falkovich\nand Sreenivasan [1] and references therein) and the dynamics of tracer particles in incompressible flows. Especially, the latter has undergone a rapid development\ndue to the enormous progress in experimental techniques\nmeasuring particle trajectories [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Motivated by these experiments, numerical simulations [8, 9,\n10], multifractal and PDF-modeling [8, 11, 12, 13, 14]\nhave revealed many interesting features of Lagrangian\nturbulence as e.g. the distinguished role of coherent\nstructures or nearly singular structures compared to the\nEulerian description. Despite this progress, simple and\nbasic questions in Lagrangian turbulence remain open. In\nthis Letter, we first state some of these open problems.\nWe show that applying a type of Corrsin approximation\n[15] in order to relate Eulerian two point velocity increments and single particle Lagrangian velocity increments\nthe definition of a new type of Lagrangian structure function becomes necessary. The properties of this new type\nof structure functions are first studied on the simpler case\nof advection of tracer particles in a frozen velocity field.\nHere, it is possible to relate the Lagrangian structure\nfunctions to the transverse Eulerian ones. Finally, the\nfull dynamical new structure functions are investigated\nusing high resolution spectral simulations (10243 mesh\npoints in 3D, 10242 mesh points in 2D) and their scaling\nbehavior is discussed.\nDescription of open problems The basic open problems in\nLagrangian turbulence that we want to address are: i) a\ndramatically decreased scaling range for the Lagrangian\nstructure functions compared to their Eulerian counterparts and ii) missing monotonicity in relating Eulerian\nto Lagrangian turbulence. In the following, we describe\nin more detail the meaning of these points.\ni) One major problem in using the usual Lagrangian velocity increments u(x(y, t), t) \u2212 u(y, 0) is their dramatically decreased scaling range compared to their Eulerian counterparts. This issue is visible in Fig. 1 and\n\n3.5\n\np=6 longitudinal\np=6 transversal\np=3 transversal\np=3 longitudinal\n\n3\nd log(Sp)/d log(l)\n\narXiv:0705.3132v1 [physics.flu-dyn] 22 May 2007\n\n2\n\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n0.001\n\n0.01\nl/\u03b7\n\nFIG. 1: Logarithmic derivative of 3D Eulerian longitudinal\nand transverse structure functions\n\nFig. 2. Here, the logarithmic derivatives for Eulerian\nand Lagrangian structure functions are shown. For the\nlatter it is hard to detect a clear scaling range. Using extended self-similarity (ESS [17]) the situation gets\nslightly better. Biferale et al. [8] have chosen the interval\n10\u03c4\u03b7 \u2264 \u03c4 \u2264 50\u03c4\u03b7 as a possible scaling range whereas in\nthe experiments [4], [7] and the simulation [10] smaller\ntemporal increments have been chosen (approximately\n3\u03c4\u03b7 \u2264 \u03c4 \u2264 15\u03c4\u03b7 ) where \u03c4\u03b7 denotes the Kolmogorov dissipation time. Clearly, in each of this different temporal\nregions, different physics takes place: for large time lags,\na tendency to Gaussian behavior sets in whereas strong\nvortices influence the intermittency for smaller time increments. Therefore, the question arises where to locate\nthe inertial range and even the question whether there is\nany scaling range at all must be taken seriously.\nii) The present attempts to describe Lagrangian intermittency mostly translate features from the Eulerian viewpoint in a simple way to the Lagrangian one. The first\nstep is an assumption how to relate velocity increments\nin time \u03b4\u03c4 v to velocity increments in space \u03b4r u. The\nassumption used in [8] is a Kolmogorov type argument\n\n\f2\n3\n2.5\n\n1\n\n2\nK(\u03c4)\n\nd log(Sp)/d log \u03c4\n\n10\n\np=2\np=4\np=6\n\n1.5\n\n0.1\n\n1\n0.5\n\n0.01\n1\n\n\u03c4/\u03c4\u03b7\n\n10\n\nFIG. 2: Logarithmic derivative of 3D Lagrangian structure\nfunctions\n\nthat r and \u03c4 are related by the typical eddy turnover\ntime on that scale: \u03c4 \u223c r/\u03b4r u. With this identification, the Eulerian multifractal modeling can be translated to the Lagrangian one yielding predictions for Lagrangian structure functions and PDFs of the acceleration. The important ingredient is the Eulerian singularity spectrum ([12], [8]). A direct consequence of this\ntype of modeling is the observation that if one considers two different turbulent systems (e.g. magnetohydrodynamic versus Navier-Stokes turbulence or 3D versus\n2D Navier-Stokes turbulence) where one system is more\nintermittent than the other in the Eulerian framework,\nthan this system should also be more intermittent in the\nLagrangian framework. We call this feature the monotonicity property. For the case of MHD turbulence this\nhas been shown not to be true [10]. The problem is even\nmore visible if one compares scaling in the inverse energy cascade in Navier-Stokes flows in two dimensions\nwith the direct cascade in three dimensions. It turns out\n(see Kamps and Friedrich [9]) that although the inverse\ncascade shows no intermittency in the Eulerian framework, the Lagrangian intermittency is as strong as in the\nthree-dimensional case. In order to characterize intermittency we have determined the excess curtosis of the\nLagrangian velocity increment time difference (see Fig.\n3). The Lagrangian curtosis is definitely different from\na non-intermittent situation exhibiting clear scaling behavior. It decays to zero for large time differences with\na powerlaw with scaling exponent of about 1.2 . In addition, calculating Lagrangian structure functions in the\nsame manner as in [10] yields similar values for the scaling exponents (see [9]).\nNew Lagrangian structure function A first attempt to\nrelate Eulerian and Lagrangian statistics has been made\nby Corrsin [15]. Although the Corrsin approximation has\nserious shortcomings, as has been recently discussed by\nOtt and Mann [18], it can serve as a first guideline. Let\nus consider the PDF f (v, t) of the Lagrangian velocity\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\u03c4/TL\n\n1\n\nFIG. 3: Excess curtosis K(\u03c4 ) of 2D Lagrangian turbulence\n\nincrement\nv(y, t) = u(x(y, t), t) \u2212 u(y, 0) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere x(y, t) = x\u0303(y, t) + y denotes the particle path\nstarting at position y at time t = 0, i.e. x\u0303(y, t = 0) = 0:\nf (v, t) = h\u03b4(v \u2212 [u(x(y, t), t) \u2212 u(y, 0)])i\n(2)\nZ\n=\ndxh\u03b4(x \u2212 x(y, t))\u03b4(v \u2212 [u(x, t) \u2212 u(y, 0)])i .\nWe assume homogeneous turbulence such that the dependence on the starting position y vanishes. The Corrsin\napproximation relies on the assumption of statistical independency of the path x(y, t) and the velocity difference\nu(x, t) \u2212 u(y, 0) leading to the factorization of the expectation value:\nZ\nf (v, t) = dx p(x; y, t)h\u03b4(v \u2212 [u(x, t) \u2212 u(y, 0)])i (3)\nHere, the transition probability p(x; y, t),\np(x; y, t) = h\u03b4(x \u2212 x(y, t))i\n\n(4)\n\nhas been introduced. In this approximation, no direct\nrelationship between the PDF of the Lagrangian and Eulerian velocity increments can be established. However,\nformula (3) suggests to define the novel velocity increment\nw(y, t) = u(y + x\u0303(y, t), t) \u2212 u(y, t)\n\n(5)\n\nIn this case a direct connection of Eulerian and Lagrangian velocity increments becomes possible:\nZ\nf (w, t) = dx p(x, y|w, t)h\u03b4(w \u2212 [u(x, t) \u2212 u(y, t)])i\n(6)\nHere, we have introduced the conditional transition probability for a particle starting at t=0 at position y and\n\n\f3\n3\n\np=1\np=2\np=3\np=4\np=5\np=6\n\nd log(Sp)/d log(\u03c4)\n\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n1\n\n10\n\n\u03c4/\u03c4\u03b7\n\nFIG. 4: Logarithmic derivative of Lagrangian structure functions in frozen 3D Navier-Stokes turbulence, R\u03bb = 316\n\n1000\n\n100\nl/\u03b7\n\nending at time t at position x under the condition that\nthe velocity increment across scale x \u2212 y is just w.\nCorrsin's approximation to the exact expression (6) replaces this conditional probability distribution by the\nunconditioned one. We want to point out that a similar correspondence between Eulerian velocity increment\nvE (r, t) and Lagrangian velocity increment v(y, t) can\nnot be established in such a straightforward manner. A\nfurther property, which is relevant for two dimensional\nfluid turbulence, follows directly from the exact relation\n(6), which relates Lagrangian and Eulerian increment\nstatistics. If the Eulerian statistics does not exhibit intermittency whereas Lagrangian statistics does, the signatures of intermittency are contained in the conditional\nprobability distribution p(x, y|w, t).\nThe definition of the Lagrangian velocity increment (5)\nactually focuses on the fluctuations related to the motion\nof the particle in the turbulent field. In contrast to the\nusual definition, there is no contribution from the fluctuations due to the temporal evolution of the velocity\nfield at two different spatial points. Therefore, one expects that the statistics of this increment is close to the\none obtained from the motion of a Lagrangian particle\nin a frozen turbulent field. For two dimensional turbulence, thereby, the motion of the Lagrangian particles\nare integrable and related to the lines of constant stream\nfunction.\nCase I: Frozen turbulence The proposed novel velocity\nincrement naturally occurs in frozen turbulence. Here,\nthe tracer particles are advanced in a static velocity field.\nIn this scenario the novel velocity increment (5) and the\nstandard Lagrangian velocity increment (1) are identical. The measured structure functions of several orders\nare given in Fig. 4. They exhibit an extended inertial\nrange, whose size is approximately as large as in Eulerian turbulence, if the time-lag is transformed into spatial\ndifferences. The scaling exponents of frozen turbulence\nare given in Table. I. They can be explained as follows:\nThe main contributions to the structure functions originate from half circles like trajectories. The starting and\nending points of these are separated by a distance l (see\nFig. 6). In this configuration the velocity increment (5)\ncorresponds to the transverse Eulerian velocity increment\nover this distance l. The corresponding structure functions are shown in Fig. 1. The transverse statistics are\nslightly more intermittent, as was already observed by\n[16]. It is still under discussion if this might be a finite\nReynolds number effect. However, the Lagrangian scaling exponents \u03b6pF of frozen turbulence and the Eulerian\ntransverse exponents \u03b6pT fulfill the relation \u03b6pF = (\u03b6pT )0.92 ,\nas can be seen in Table I. The exponent 0.92 comes from\nthe scaling law of the mean separation l within the inertial range. As is shown in Fig. 5 l scales as \u03c4 0.92 .\nCase II: Dynamical turbulence We have determined the\nscaling exponents of the new Lagrangian structure function for two and three dimensions.

In the present Letter, we have\nexamined possible relations between Eulerian and La-\n\n3\n\np=1\np=2\np=3\np=4\np=5\np=6\n\nd log(Sp)/d log \u03c4\n\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n1\n\n\u03c4/\u03c4\u03b7\n\n10\n\nFIG. 7: Logarithmic derivative of the new Lagrangian structure functions for 3D Navier-Stokes turbulence, R\u03bb = 316\n\ngrangian intermittency. Furthermore, we have defined\na new Lagrangian velocity increment, which directly focuses on the fluctuations picked up by a moving Lagrangian particle. This new increment exhibits a more\npronounced scaling regime. Its scaling behavior is equal\nto the one obtained for frozen turbulence and can be related to the Eulerian transverse structure functions. In\nfact, the probability distributions of this new type of increment and the one obtained from frozen turbulence coincide. This has been verified for three dimensional as\nwell as two dimensional turbulence.\n\nAcknowledgments.- Access to the JUMP multiprocessor\ncomputer at the FZ J\u00fclich was made available through\nproject HB022.
