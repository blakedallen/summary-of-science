It is found that the crossover\nfrom a two-site to single-site bipolaron is more abrupt and shifts to a larger electron-phonon coupling\nstrength as electron-electron Coulomb repulsion increases.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIt has been demonstrated for more than one decade\nthat the polaronic effects observed in High-Tc superconducting cuprates [1] and the colossal magnorestive manganites [2] are relevant to the electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling in these systems. The famous Holstein molecular\ncrystal model [3], where electrons are coupled with local\nphonons, has then revived in recent years. More recently,\nto include the electron-electron (e-e) Coulomb repulsion\ninteractions, the Hubbard-Holstein (HH) model [4] for\nstrongly correlated electron systems has made significant\nprogress in understanding many-body aspects. As is well\nknown, an exact solution to this model in the thermodynamic limit is impossible, and many approximate approaches are then employed. The two-site HH model,\nwhere two electrons hop between two adjacent lattice\nsites, can be solved analytically[5]. It is not only a prototype of the HH model but also helpful for the better\nunderstanding to the polaron and bipolaron behavior in\ninfinite lattices.\nRecently, an contemporary alternative characterization of the ground state (GS) properties has been focused\non quantum information tools in terms of quantum entanglement [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and fidelity [11, 12, 13, 14, 15,\n16, 17]. These studies will establish somewhat interesting understanding from the field of quantum information\ntheory to condensed matter physics [18, 19]. Usually, it\nis hard to calculate these quantities due to the lack of\nknowledge on the exact GS wave function.\nThe two-site HH model has been previously addressed\nby means of different methods, such as variational\nmethod [20, 21], perturbation theory [22], and numerical diagonalization[23, 24]. In spite of these efforts\nthere remains poor convergence in the intermediate coupling regime. A reliable treatment in the whole coupling regime is still needed. Recently, Berciu derived all\nGreens's function analytically for the two-site HH model\nin terms continued fractions[5].\n\nIn this work, by using extended bosonic coherent states\n[25, 26, 27], we develop a new exact technique to deal\nwith the two-site HH model. The wave function is proposed explicitly, by which many quantities can be calculated directly. The paper is organized as follows. In Sec\nII we introduce the model and describe the approach. In\nSec III we calculate the linear entropy , the GS fidelity\nand its susceptibility to study crossover properties from\nquantum information perspective. The static correlation\nfunction is also evaluated to analyze the GS properties.\nThe main conclusions are given in the last section.\n\nII.\n\nMODEL HAMILTONIAN AND EXACT\nSOLUTION\n\nThe Hamiltonian of the two-site HH model takes the\nform\nX \u2020\nX\n\u03b5ni\u03c3 \u2212\nt(c1\u03c3 c2\u03c3 + c\u20202\u03c3 c1\u03c3 )\nH =\n\u03c3\n\ni,\u03c3\n\n+ U\n\nX\ni\n\n+ g 2 \u03c90\n\nni\u2191 ni\u2193 + V n1 n2 + g1 \u03c90\n\nX\ni,\u03c3\n\nX\n\nni,\u03c3 (bi + b\u2020i )\n\ni,\u03c3\n\nni,\u03c3 (bi+\u03b4 +\n\nb\u2020i+\u03b4 )\n\n+ \u03c90\n\nX\n\nb\u2020i bi ,\n\n(1)\n\ni\n\nwhere i(= 1 or 2) denotes the label of sites. i + \u03b4 = 2\nfor i = 1 and vice versa. ci\u03c3 (c\u2020i\u03c3 ) is the annihilation (creation) operator for the electrons and ni,\u03c3 (= c\u2020i\u03c3 ci\u03c3 ) is the\ncorresponding number operator at site i with spin \u03c3, besides ni = ni\u2191 + ni\u2193 . \u03b5 is the unperturbed site potential.\nt is the usual hopping integral.

Note that the linear\nterm for the phonon operator d(d+ ) is removed, and two\nnew free bosonic field with operator A(A+ ) and B(B + )\nappear. In the next step, we naturally choose the basis in terms of these new operator, instead of d(d+ ), by\nwhich the phonon states |\u03c61 i and |\u03c62 i can be expanded\nin complete basis |niA and |niB respectively, where |niA\n\n(9)\n\nAs we know that the vacuum state |0iA(B) is just\na bosonic coherent-state in d(d+ ) with an eigenvalue\n2g(\u22122g\u2212)[25, 26, 27]. So this new basis is overcomplete,\nand actually does not involve any truncation in the Fock\nspace of d(d+ ), which highlights the present approach. It\nis also clear that many-body correlations for bosons are\nessentially included in extended coherent states (8) and\n(9).

In the Ref. [5], the energy vs \u03bb curves in two\nregimes are fitted by two functions, and the abrupt drop\nof the first-order derivative signals the crossover regime\nfrom two-site bipolarons to single-site bipolarons. We\nwill propose a quantitative criterion. Because the exact\nwave function in the present technique is explicitly given,\nwe can calculate the probability of the system that two\nelectrons are in two sites by Eq. (4) directly.\nP2 = Reh\u03c63 |\u03c63 i\n\n(14)\n\n4\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nFIG. 2: GS energy E0 /t and the probability of the two-site\nbipolarons P2 in the inset vs \u03bb for V = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 by choosing V = 0.2, t = 2.0, \u03b5 = 0.8.\n\nGS\n\n0.8\n\n0\n\n1st\n2nd\n\n-3\n\n3rd\n\n0.6\n\n4th\n\n2\n\n5th\n\nP\n\nrange. It should be noted that in the exact diagonalization in Fock space of original phonon state d [24], a\nconsiderable large phonon number is needed to give reasonably good results. We believe that we have exactly\nsolved this model numerically.\nTo show the effectiveness of the present approach, we\nfirst calculate the GS energy. Fig. 1(a) presents the GS\nenergy E0 /t as a function of the on-site effective coupling\nstrength \u03bb = g12 /t by setting g2 = 0 conveniently. The\nresults for the energy by the variational method based on\nthe modified Lang-Firsov transformation with a squeezing phonon state transformations (MLFS) [20] are also\nlist. It is observed that the present results are lower than\nthe MLFS results [20], especially in the intermediate coupling regime. Comparing with the Fig. 1(a) in Ref. [5],\nwe find that the present results for the GS energy are\nconsistent with those from the lowest pole of a Green's\nfunction.\n\n3\n\nE/t\n\nFIG. 1: (a) GS energy E0 /t of exact solution (solid line) and\nMLFS transformation (dashed line) vs \u03bb for U = 0, 3, 6 and\n10.

At the weak coupling, the two electrons\nprefer to stay in two sites. As the coupling strength increases, the two electrons tend to occupy the single site.\nStrictly speaking, at weak (strong) coupling, it is not pure\ntwo-site (single-site) bipolarons, only dominated two-site\n(single-site) bipolarons. The crossover regime is wide\nfor weak on-site Coulomb repulsion U . As U increases,\nthe crossover shifts to larger \u03bb and becomes more sharp.\nHowever, the jump of the P2 is not observed, indicating\nunlikely a phase transition.\nThe inter-site Coulomb repulsion V may favor the formation of dominated single-site bipoalrons. To show this\neffect, we calculate the GS energy and the probability of\nthe two-site bipolarons for several values of V for fixed\nU , which are displayed in Fig. 2. It is clear that the\ncrossover shifts to smaller \u03bb with increasing V , and becomes more smooth.\nIn our approach, we can also get the excited states and\n\n\f4\n\nB.\n\nLinear entropy\n\nTo investigate the crossover from two-site to single-site\nbipolarons in quantum information science, we attempt\nto study quantum entanglement between electrons and\ntheir surrounding phonons by means of the linear entropy El [28, 29], which is an alternative measurement\nto indicate the entanglement of a two-site and single-site\nbipolaron. It is defined as\nEl = 1 \u2212 T r\u03c12 ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03c1 = T rph (|\u03c8ih\u03c8|) is the reduced density matrix of\nelectrons by taking partial trace over the phonon degrees\nof the freedom.\nThe normalized GS wave function of the singlet bipolaronic state in Eq.(4) is described as\n|\u03c8i = |\u03c61 i|1i + |\u03c62 i|2i + |\u03c63 i|3i,\n\n0.5\n\nl\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\nE\n\ncorresponding energies. Both the GS and a few low excited state bipolaron energies for U = 6 are presented\nin Fig. 3(a). Interesting, we find that the curves for the\nGS and the 1st excited state energies, the 2nd and 3rd\nexcited state energies, 4th and 5th excited state energies\nalmost merge into a single line in the strong coupling\nregime. The corresponding two eigenstates are almost\ndegenerated. Actually they are different. The difference\nis too small to be observed. The merged point shift to\nlarger \u03bb for higher excited states. To show the bipolaron\nbehavior in these states, we also calculate the probability\nof the two-site bipolarons P2 as a function of \u03bb, which are\nshown in Fig.3(b). The P2 vs \u03bb curves also merge into\na single line exactly at the same point as the energy vs\n\u03bb curves. In the GS and 1st excited state, the value of\nP2 decreases monotonously as \u03bb. However, in the other\nhigh excited states, a non-monotonous behavior of the\nP2 is observed. In a fixed value of \u03bb, the probability of\nthe two-site bipolarons P2 determines the positive repulsion energy for the double occupancy, the energy gained\nfor the two electrons in the same site, and the energy\ngained for the hopping of electrons from one site to other\nsite. To increase the energy in higher excited states, the\ncompetition of these energies contributes the complicated\nbehavior shown in Fig.3(b).\n\n0.2\nU=0\n\n0.1\n\nU=3\nU=6\nU=10\n\n0.0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nFIG. 4: Linear entropy El vs \u03bb for U = 0, 3, 6, 10 by choosing\nV = 0.2, t = 2.0, \u03b5 = 0.8. The maximum El = 0.5 corresponds to the single-site bipolaron in strong coupling region.\n\nAs plotted in Fig.4, the linear entropy El increases\nsmoothly with the e-ph coupling parameters \u03bb for different e-e Coulomb repulsions U . In general, in weak\ne-ph coupling region, two electrons tend to occupy two\nsites, and form so-called two-site bipolaron, resulting a\nlow degree of the quantum entanglement in the original\ncoupling strength. For a fixed U , as \u03bb increases two electrons become to tightly interact with the same lattice. So\nthe entire charge of the electrons and entire deformations\nof the lattices are restricted on one site, leading to the formation of a single-site bipolaron. However, the two-site\nbipolaron is known as that each electron just interacts\nwith phonons of its own site and then the linear entropy is\nexpected to be much smaller than that of the singlet-site\nbipolaron. As shown in Fig.4 the linear entropy reaches\nits maximum El = 0.5 in the strong coupling region,\nwhich displays that the single-site bipolarons are maximally entangled. Obviously the crossover point shifts to\na large value of the coupling strength \u03bb as U increases.\nThe similar crossover point has been demonstrated by\nthe probability of the two-site bipolarons presented in\nFig. 1(b). Therefore we can say that in the presence of\nquantum correlations the two-site and singlet-site bipolarons are effectively characterized to a high (low) degree\nof bipartite quantum entanglement.\n\n(16)\n\nwhere the phonon states satisfy h\u03c61 |\u03c61 i + h\u03c62 |\u03c62 i +\nh\u03c63 |\u03c63 i = 1.

Therefore the linear entropy can be\nderived simply as\n\nEl = 1 \u2212 [h\u03c61 |\u03c61 i2 + h\u03c62 |\u03c62 i2 + h\u03c63 |\u03c63 i2\n+ 2Re(h\u03c61 |\u03c62 i2 + h\u03c61 |\u03c63 i2 + h\u03c62 |\u03c63 i2 )] (17)\n\nC.\n\nground state fidelity\n\nMore recently, another temporary effective quantum\ninformation tools, i.e., the fidelity has been put forward\nto analyze complicated interacting systems from the perspective of the GS wave functions [14, 17], first identifying polaronic crossover behaviors in bosonic system [19].\nA simple expression of the fidelity F (g1 , g1 + \u03b4g1 ) is given\njust by the modulus of the overlap of two ground states\ncorresponding to two different coupling parameters g1\nand g1 + \u03b4g1 , where g1 is a tiny perturbation parameter [15]. It is expected to signal a peak at the critical\npoint. The general GS fidelity is written as\n\n\f5\nD.\nU=0\n\n1\n\n80\n\nU=3\nU=6\nU=10\n\n0.9999998\n\nS\n\n60\n\nF\n\n0.9999996\n\n40\n\n0.9999994\n\n20\n\nU=0\n0.9999992\n\nU=3\nU=6\nU=10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n(a)\n\n2\n\n3\n\n(b)\n\n4\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nstatic correlation function\n\nSince the bipolaron crossover transition has been indeed known from the quantum information perspective.\nNaturally, we seek classically to discuss this crossover by\nthe means of the static on-site and inter-site correlation\nfunctions hn1 u1 i and hn1 u2 i, which reveal the spatial extent of lattice deformations induced by electrons respectively. The ui denotes the lattice deformations on site\ni produced by the electrons and ni is the number operator of the electrons. The GS correlation functions are\nwritten as\nhn1 u1,2 i = hn1 [\u00b1(d + d\u2020 )/2 \u2212 2gn1,2 ]i\n\nFIG. 5: GS fidelity F and its susceptibility S versus \u03bb for\nU = 0, 3, 6, 10 by choosing V = 0.2, t = 2.0, \u03b5 = 0.8. A\nsharper drop is shown at the crossover for larger U = 10(solid\nline).\n\nF = h\u03c8(g1 )|\u03c8(g1 + \u03b4g1 )i\n= |h\u03c61 (g1 )|\u03c61 (g1 + \u03b4g1 )i + h\u03c62 (g1 )|\u03c62 (g1 + \u03b4g1 )i\n+ h\u03c63 (g1 )|\u03c63 (g1 + \u03b4g1 )i|\n(18)\nwhere |\u03c8(g1 )i and |\u03c8(g1 + \u03b4g1 )i are two normalized GS\ncorresponding to neighboring Hamiltonian parameters.\nIn our calculation \u03b4g1 = 10\u22124 is used. While the fidelity\nsusceptibility S(g1 ) is regarded as a more effective tool\nto detect the singularity at the crossover regime, which\nreads [30]\nS(g1 ) =\n\nlim [1 \u2212 F (g1 , g1 + \u03b4g1 )]/(\u03b4g12 )\n\n\u03b4g1 \u2212\u21920\n\n(19)\n\nThe GS fidelity F and its susceptibility S as a functions\nof effective coupling strength \u03bb (= g12 /t) for different ee Coulomb repulsion U are displayed in Fig. 5(a) and\n(b). A narrow dramatic drop is observed in the vicinity\nof the bipolaron transition point as a consequence of the\ndramatic change of the structure of the GS wave function,\nimplying that the crossover from the two-site to singletsite bipolaron occurs. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the values\nof the GS fidelity are approximated to 1. As is known,\nfor the quantum phase transition system the GS wave\nfunctions from different sides of the level-crossing point\nare almost orthogonal [14]. However, there is absent of\nthe level-crossing and then values of peaks of the GS\nfidelity are around to 1 rather than 0 at the crossover\npoint. Further evidence for this crossover is given by\nthe susceptibility S, which shows a cusp structure in the\nintermediate coupling regime in Fig. 5(b). Obviously,\nthe crossover becomes more abrupt and the critical value\nof the e-ph coupling \u03bb where the peak appears becomes\nlarger as the Coulomb repulsion U increases from 0 to 10.\nSo it is illustrated that the transition behavior from twosite to singlet-site bipolaron can be effectively detected\nby a singularity of the GS fidelity and its susceptibility.\n\n(20)\n\nThe positive (negative) sign and n1 (n2 ) are associated\nwith hn1 u1 i and hn1 u2 i respectively. By using the exact GS wave function of the singlet bipolaronic state obtained above, the correlation functions Eq.(20) can be\nexpressed as follows\nhn1 u2 i = \u22122g1\n\nN\nX\nm=0\n\n2\nfm\n\u2212\n\nN\nX\n\u221a\n\u2217\nm(c\u2217m cm\u22121 + 0.5fm\nfm\u22121 )\nm=1\n\n\u2212\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\n\u221a\n\n\u2217\nm + 1(c\u2217m cm+1 + 0.5fm\nfm+1 )\n\n(21)\n\nm=0\n\nhn1 u1 i = \u22122g1\n\nN\nX\n\n2\n(4c2m + fm\n)\n\nm=0\n\nN\nX\n\u221a\n\u2217\nm(c\u2217m cm\u22121 + 0.5fm\nfm\u22121 )\n+\nm=1\n\n+\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\n\u221a\n\n\u2217\nm + 1(c\u2217m cm+1 + 0.5fm\nfm+1 ).(22)\n\nm=0\n\nThe functions \u2212hn1 u1 i and \u2212hn1 u2 i against the eph coupling strength \u03bb are plotted in Figs. 6 (a) and\n(b). One can observe that \u2212hn1 u1 i and \u2212hn1 u2 i increase\nmonotonically with \u03bb in weak coupling regime. When \u03bb\nexceeds a critical value, \u2212hn1 u1 i and \u2212hn1 u2 i show different behaviors. It is clearly shown that two electrons\nare localized on one site in strong coupling region, resulting the singlet-site bipolaron. It also demonstrates that\nthe e-e interaction U affects the magnitude of inter-site\n(on-site) deformations hn1 u2 i (\u2212hn1 u1 i) and the transition point where \u2212hn1 u2 i reaches maximum shifts to a\nlarger \u03bb as U increases.\nThe nature of the bipolaron crossover can also be investigated by the correlation function h(n1 \u2212n2 )(u1 \u2212u2 )i/g1 .\nFigs.6(c) shows that the two-site bipolaron regime of the\ncoupling strength \u03bb is wider for larger U in the weak\ne-ph coupling regime.
