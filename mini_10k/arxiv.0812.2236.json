If the fundamental physical laws do not respect\nthese symmetries, then we could expect to see evidence of Lorentz and CPT violations\neven in the effective theory that governs conventional low-energy phenomena. If small\nviolations of these symmetries were discovered, this would provide a critically important\npiece of information about the fundamental structure of physics and a clue to what other\nnew effects we could expect to see. There is a parameterization of Lorentz and CPT\nviolations in low-energy effective field theory, known as the standard model extension\n(SME), which contains possible Lorentz- and CPT-violating corrections to the standard\nmodel [1, 2] and general relativity [3]. Both the renormalizability [4, 5] and stability [6]\nof the SME have been carefully examined.\nThe SME provides a useful framework for interpreting experimental tests of Lorentz\nand CPT symmetry. Sensitive searches for Lorentz violation have included studies of\nmatter-antimatter asymmetries for trapped charged particles [13, 14, 15] and bound\nstate systems [16, 17], determinations of muon properties [18, 19], analyses of the behavior of spin-polarized matter [20, 21], frequency standard comparisons [22, 23, 24, 25],\nMichelson-Morley experiments with cryogenic resonators [26, 27, 28], Doppler effect measurements [29, 30], measurements of neutral mesons [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36], polarization\nmeasurements on the light from distant galaxies [37, 38, 39, 40], high-energy astrophysical\ntests [41, 42, 43, 44] and others. The results of these experiments set bounds on various\nSME coefficients. Up-to-date information about bounds on the SME coefficients may\nbe found in [45]; at the present time, many of the SME coefficients are quite strongly\nconstrained, but many others are not.\nThere are many systems and reaction processes that could potentially be used to\nset further bounds on the SME's coefficients for Lorentz violation. We shall consider a\nparticular system-the helium nucleus, or \u03b1-particle-because of the insights it provides\ninto the general properties of Lorentz-violating physics.\nOne challenging problem in the study of Lorentz violation is understanding Lorentz\nviolation for composite particles. The fundamental fields in the SME are the gauge\nfields, leptons, quarks, and the Higgs. However, bounds on Lorentz violation are usually\nformulated in terms of bounds on SME coefficients for hadrons, rather than the more\nfundamental quark and gluon coefficients. The reason for this is obvious; hadrons are\nthe physical excitation of the strongly interacting fields. However, they have a nontrivial\nstructure, and the relationship between the quark, gluon, and hadron coefficients is not\nentirely clear.\nThere are very precise bounds on many Lorentz violation coefficients for the proton and\nneutron. However, most measurements of these coefficients are made not on free nucleons\nbut on more complicated nuclei. Some model must be used to relate the possible effects of\nLorentz violation in the nuclear system to the coefficients for individual nucleons. This is a\n1\n\n\fsimpler problem than relating hadron coefficients to the coefficients for subnuclear partons.\nIt is often reasonable to take a simplified model, such as the Schmidt model [46], which\nassigns all the angular momentum of nucleus to a single unpaired nucleon constituent.\nHowever, this model obviously entails a great deal of idealization, and we would like to\nunderstand the nature of Lorentz violation in nuclei and other composite particles more\nfully.\nIn this paper, we shall consider one of the simplest composite particles: the helium\nnucleus, containing two protons and two neutrons. The simple closed shell structure of\nthis nucleus ensures that many spin-dependent coefficients must vanish. Yet there is still\nsome nontrivial structure which we shall uncover. We shall then examine the possible\nimpact of Lorentz violation on the \u03b1-decays of nuclei.\nThere are several motivations for this work. First, it presents a new calculation of the\neffective Lorentz violation coefficients for a composite particle, in terms of the coefficients\nfor its constituents. Second, it examines how the effects of Lorentz violation can affect\nthe intrinsically quantum mechanical phenomenon of tunneling. Finally, it suggests a\nnew method for placing laboratory bounds on a number of Lorentz violation coefficients\nfor protons and neutrons. Although the likely constraints are not particularly tight,\nthis method offers a way to constrain several coefficients that have not previously been\nbounded by laboratory experiments.\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the Lorentz violation coefficients\nrelevant for \u03b1-particles and how these are related to the coefficients for the constituent\nprotons and neutrons. Then Section 3 shows how these coefficients could impact the physical process of \u03b1-decay. In Section 4 we look quantitatively at how \u03b1-decay studies could\nbe used to place bounds on a number of Lorentz violation coefficients and in Section 5\npresent our conclusions.\n\n2\n\nLorentz Violation for \u03b1-Particles\n\nIn this section, we shall derive the effective Hamiltonian for an \u03b1-particle, including the\neffects of Lorentz symmetry violations in the proton and neutron sectors. In both this\nsection and the next, some approximations will be necessary in order to calculate the\neffects of the Lorentz violation on \u03b1-decays. However, the results will be at least semiquantitative and good enough to place order of magnitude bounds.\nThe minimal SME Lagrange density of a single species of fermion is\nwhere\nand\n\nLf = \u03c8\u0304(i\u0393\u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u2212 M)\u03c8,\n\n(1)\n\n1\nM = m+ 6 a\u2212 6 b\u03b35 + H \u03bc\u03bd \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd + im5 \u03b35 ,\n2\n\n(2)\n\n1\n\u0393\u03bc = \u03b3 \u03bc + c\u03bd\u03bc \u03b3\u03bd \u2212 d\u03bd\u03bc \u03b3\u03bd \u03b35 + e\u03bc + if \u03bc \u03b35 + g \u03bb\u03bd\u03bc \u03c3\u03bb\u03bd .\n2\n\n(3)\n\n2\n\n\fElectromagnetic interactions are introduced via the minimal coupling substitution p\u03bc \u2192\np\u03bc \u2212 qA\u03bc , where q is the charge.

The effective Hamiltonian for the composite particle, H\u03b1 ,\ninvolves a sum of four Hf Hamiltonians-one for each of the nucleon constituents-plus\nadditional contributions due to nuclear binding effects. We shall not consider the binding\nin detail; it's role will simply be to ensure that the four nucleons follow essentially identical\nspacetime trajectories. Moreover, to an excellent approximation, the two protons and two\nneutrons in this nucleus are each separately in a spin singlet state.\nSo the operator to create an \u03b1-particle at ~x is a\u2020 (~x) = 2b\u2020p\u2191 (~x)b\u2020p\u2193 (~x)b\u2020n\u2191 (~x)b\u2020p\u2193 (~x), where\nb\u2020p\u2191 (or b\u2020n\u2193 ) is the creation operator for a spin up proton (or spin down neutron). Because\nof the anticommutivity of the fermion operators,\ni\n1h \u2020\nb\u2020\u2191 (~x)b\u2020\u2193 (~x) =\nb\u2191 (~x1 )b\u2020\u2193 (~x2 ) \u2212 b\u2020\u2191 (~x2 )b\u2020\u2193 (~x1 )\n,\n(5)\n2\n~\nx1 =~\nx2 =~\nx\nand a\u2020 produces an excitation with the total proton spin and total neutron spin both\nequal to zero.\nEach of the two protons carries the same mechanical momentum and likewise for the\ntwo neutrons. (Since the proton and neutron masses are very similar, each nucleon carries\napproximately one-fourth of the total momentum of the \u03b1-particle.) Consequently, when\nthe spin-dependent terms in each Hf are added together, they give contributions to H\u03b1\nwhich depend only on ~\u03c3p1 + ~\u03c3p2 and ~\u03c3n1 + ~\u03c3n2 -the total proton and neutron spin vectors\nin the nucleus. But in the spin-0 singlet state, both of these operators vanish identically.\nTherefore, none of the spin dependent terms in Hf will contribute to H\u03b1 .\n\n3\n\n\fSo we may neglect all spin-dependent terms in Hf . Doing this, we are left with a\nHamiltonian equivalent to\n\u0012\n\u0013\np2\n1\npj pk\npj\nHf \u2243\n\u2212 cjk + c00 \u03b4jk\n\u2212 [aj + m (c0j + cj0 ) \u2212 mej ] .\n(6)\n2m\n2\nm\nm\nHowever, it is known that the a\u03bc parameters are unobservable, except in interactions that\ninvolve gravitation or flavor changing interactions [49]. The field redefinition\n\u03c8 \u2192 e\u2212ia*x \u03c8, \u03c8\u0304 \u2192 eia*x\n\n(7)\n\neliminates a from the Lagrangian (1) entirely. This is equivalent to a translation in\nmomentum space, p\u03bc \u2192 p\u03bc \u2212 a\u03bc . In a theory with a only, the shifted p~ is the correct mechanical momentum \u03b3m~v ; including a in the action merely corresponds to a poor choice\nof canonical momentum. Since neither gravity nor the weak interaction are involved with\n\u03b1-decay, a will not contribute to any observable quantity in this kind of decay process.\nMoreover, any coefficients that enter in the same manner as a must also prove unobp\nservable; the whole expression [aj \u2212 m (c0j + cj0 ) \u2212 mej ] mj cannot affect \u03b1-decay physics.\nNeglecting this term, we are left with the final fermion Hamiltonian relevant to \u03b1-decay,\nHf \u2243\n\n\u0002\n\u0003 pj pk\np2\n\u2212 c(jk) + c00 \u03b4jk\n,\n2m\n2m\n\n(8)\n\nwhere c(jk) = cjk + ckj . Only the c terms in the fermion sector can affect \u03b1-decays, and\nthe remaining terms in the effective Hamiltonian are all separately invariant under C, P,\nand T.\nThe c00 term is not observable in solely nonrelativistic experiments; it merely changes\nthe effective value of m. However, we shall retain it, and its effects can be observed by\ncomparing the kinetic energy of a nonrelativistically moving particle with the mass energy\nm observed in particle creation or annihilation processes.\nTo find a useful effective Hamiltonian for the \u03b1-particle, we must take the sum of four\nHf terms and then perform a canonical transformation. The transformation will separate\nthe center of mass motion from the relative motions of the four nucleons, and it is the\ncenter of mass motion that determines the motion of the \u03b1-particle.\nTo see how the center of mass Hamiltonian is modified by c-type Lorentz violation for\nthe constituents, it is simpler to first consider the case of a two-particle bound state. The\nproblem can be further simplified by considering a situation in which there is Lorentz\nviolation in the Hamiltonian for only one of the two constituents. Once this simple\nexample has been worked out, the generalization to more constituent particles and more\nsources of Lorentz violation is straightforward.\nFor the two-particle example, the Hamiltonian is\nH=\n\n\u0002\n\u0003 p2j p2k\np2\np21\n+ 2 \u2212 c(jk) + c00 \u03b4jk\n.\n2m1 2m2\n2m2\n4\n\n(9)\n\n\fSince the term in brackets in (9) is symmetric in (jk) and represents a small correction,\nwe may diagonalize it by a rotation, choosing spatial coordinates in which the kinetic\nenergy for particle 2 has no off-diagonal pj pk terms. In these coordinates, the kinetic\nenergy splits, as it conventionally does, into three pieces, each of the form\nHj =\n\n\u0002\n\u0003 p22j\np21j\n+ 1 \u2212 c(jj) \u2212 c00\n.\n2m1\n2m2\n\n(10)\n\nIn (10) and for the remainder of this paragraph, j represents a specific coordinate and is\nnot to be summed over. Hj describes one-dimensional\ndynamics\nequivalent to those for\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2032\ntwo particles of masses m1 and m2 = m2 / 1 \u2212 c(jj) \u2212 c00 . The effective center of mass\nm r +m\u2032 r\ncoordinate is Rj = 1m1j1 +m\u20322 2j , and the conjugate momentum is the total momentum\n2\nPj = p1j + p2j . The center of mass part of the Hamiltonian then becomes Pj2 /2(m1 + m\u20322 ).\nIncluding the dynamics in all three directions, the total center of mass Hamiltonian is\ntherefore\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u0002\n\u0003\nm2\n1\n\u03b4jk \u2212\nc(jk) + c00 \u03b4jk Pj Pk\n(11)\nHCM =\n2(m1 + m2 )\nm1 + m2\n(once again summing over j). The results of the previous paragraph dictate this this\nformula holds in coordinates for which c(jk) is diagonal; and since (11) is written in a\ntensor form, it must also hold in the original, unrotated coordinate system.\nThe generalization to more Lorentz-violating particles is straightforward. The center of\nmass Hamiltonian will contain a mass-weighted sum of the Lorentz violation coefficients\nfor the constituents. The weights represent the fraction of the momentum carried by\nvarious constituents, and the sum is the effective Lorentz violation coefficient for the\ncomposite particle.

This means replacing mp and mn in H\u03b1 with mp \u2212 \u01eb/4 and\nmn \u2212 \u01eb/4, respectively. If we also neglect the neutron-proton mass difference, the effective\nHamiltonian for a free \u03b1-particle becomes\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 \u03b1\n1\n\u03b4jk \u2212 kjk Pj Pk ,\n(13)\nH\u03b1 =\n2m\u03b1\n2\n\u03b1\nwith kjk\n= cpjk + cnjk + (cp00 + cn00 )\u03b4jk .\n\u03b1\nThe kjk\ncoefficients are nonrelativistic versions of the Lorentz violation coefficients k\u03bc\u03bd\nfor a scalar field.

They control violations\nof boost invariance, and they cannot be measured in a purely nonrelativistic experiment.\n\u03b1\nYet the relationship between cnjk , cpjk , and kjk\nmust be the same in every Lorentz frame,\nsince we may always repeat the preceding analysis with an \u03b1-particle that is moving\nnonrelativistically in the desired frame. In order for this to hold, the full effective Lorentz\n\u03b1\n= cp\u03bd\u03bc + cn\u03bd\u03bc . (The change in the\nviolation coefficient for the \u03b1-particle must be k\u03bc\u03bd\nplacement of c00 terms just corresponds to a change in the overall normalization of the\nfield and has no physical meaning.) For a more general spin-0 bound state, the coefficient\nk\u03bc\u03bd will be a mass-weighted sum of the constituents' c\u03bd\u03bc coefficients, like the one appearing\nin (12).\nWhen each nucleon is minimally coupled to the electromagnetic field by the replace~ and Hf \u2192 Hf \u2212 qA0 , the total momentum and \u03b1-particle Hamiltonian\nment p~ \u2192 p~ \u2212 q A\n~ and H\u03b1 \u2192 H\u03b1 + 2eA0 , where e = \u2212|e| is the charge of\ntransform as P~ \u2192 P~ + 2eA\nthe electron.

There are three major places in which Lorentz violation can enter the decay\nprocess. These can be loosely related to three constituents of the interaction: the attractive interaction in the parent nucleus, the expelled \u03b1-particle, and the electromagnetic\ninteraction between the \u03b1-particle and the daughter nucleus.\nThe decay process can be understood as the \u03b1-particle tunneling from the deep attractive potential well of the nucleus, through the Coulomb barrier, and escaping to infinity.\nWhen the \u03b1-particle energy is small compared with the height of the barrier, the details\nof the potential inside the nucleus are fairly unimportant. We shall therefore neglect the\neffects of Lorentz violations on the nuclear potential. In fact, if the Lorentz violations in\nvarious sectors of the SME are comparable in magnitude (as naturalness conditions would\nsuggest), the dominant Lorentz-violating contribution to the decay rate \u0393 will arise from\none particular factor in our calculation. The exponential part of the barrier penetration\nfactor depends much more strongly on the Lorentz violation parameters than any other\nelement in the formula for \u0393; and the stronger dependence of this factor on k \u03b1 is most\npronounced when the energy of the decay is smallest compared with the height and width\nof the Coulomb barrier.\nWe shall examine the various factors that together compose the decay rate below.\n6\n\n\fHowever, we must first discuss the question of Lorentz violation in the electromagnetic\nsector, since electromagnetic Lorentz violation effects do not become negligible compared\nwith the effects of k \u03b1 in any kinematical limit. There is one form of spin-independent\nLorentz violation like c or k \u03b1 for each particle species in the standard model. Consideration only of spin-independent forms is justified by a combination of factors. Since\nthe \u03b1-particle has no spin angular momentum, it is automatic that any Lorentz violations in its sector must be spin independent. This straightforward general argument was\nconfirmed by the calculations in Section 2. In contrast, the electromagnetic sector of\nthe SME certainly contains terms that depend on photon polarization. However, these\nterms are extremely tightly constrained by astrophysical polarimetry [38, 39, 40]. Any\npolarization dependence in the phase speed of light will lead to birefringence-a change\nin the polarization of light waves as they propagate. Birefringence with the right energy\ndependence to indicate Lorentz violation is not observed even in radiation that has traversed cosmological distances. Therefore it is reasonable to neglect these terms in the\naction, leaving behind an electromagnetic sector that is spin independent. With only the\nconventional terms and spin-independent Lorentz violation, the Lagrange density for the\nfree electromagnetic sector is\n1\n1\nLA = \u2212 F \u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 (kF )\u03b2\n4\n4\n\n\u03bc\u03b2\u03bd\n\n(F \u03c1\u03bc F\u03c1 \u03bd + F \u03bc\u03c1 F \u03bd \u03c1 ) .\n\n(16)\n\nThe relevant type of Lorentz violation in each sector can be parameterized by a twoindex symmetric tensor. However, only the differences between these tensors are observable physically. A coordinate transformation can be used to eliminate this kind of\nLorentz violation entirely from one sector, at the cost of changing the coefficients in\nall other sectors. Specifically, once the birefringent terms in the electromagnetic sector\nare set to zero, the entire sector may be made conventional by a coordinate redefinition\nx\u03bc \u2192 x\u03bc \u2212 21 (kF )\u03b2\u03bc \u03b2\u03bd x\u03bd . Under such a redefinition, the Lorentz violation in the \u03b1\u03b1\n\u03b1\nparticle sector transforms k\u03bc\u03bd\n\u2192 k\u03bc\u03bd\n\u2212 (kF )\u03b2 \u03bc\u03b2\u03bd . It is this difference of coefficients that\nis ultimately measurable; however, for notational simplicity, we shall henceforth assume\n(kF )\u03b2 \u03bc\u03b2\u03bd = 0.\nNow we can discuss the details of the \u03b1-decay process in the presence of k \u03b1 . There are\ntwo ways of treating the tunneling process by which the \u03b1-particle escapes through the\nelectrostatic potential of the nucleus. The tunneling rate may be determined using either\nthe properties of exact Coulomb wave functions or the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin-Jeffreys\n(WKBJ) approximation. In generalizing the analysis of \u03b1-decay to cover the possibility\nof Lorentz violation, we shall opt for the latter approach.\nHowever, this approach immediately runs into a problem. In the presence of k \u03b1 , the\nmodified Schr\u00f6dinger is no longer separable (in either spherical or parabolic coordinates).\nIn order to use the WKBJ approximation, it is generally necessary to separate the variables; the WKBJ technique can then be applied to one variable at a time. So in order to\nget around this difficulty, we must introduce another approximation.\n7\n\n\fThe new approximation is a form of the eikonal approximation. The conventional\neikonal approximation, when applied to scattering problems, proceeds as follows. One\nexamines the linear path that a particle of a given impact parameter would follow in the\nabsence of interactions. When the interaction is \"turned on,\" a particle moving along this\nline would acquire a phase shift-which is just the time integral of the scattering potential\nalong the straight trajectory. The scattering amplitude can then be calculated from this\nphase shift.\nIn the case of \u03b1-decay, a different sort of eikonal approximation is required. To calculate the barrier penetration factor, we shall treat the ejected \u03b1-particle as if it were\nescaping along a well-defined linear path in the direction of its ultimate velocity. However, since the region of interest along this path is part of the classically forbidden region,\nwe shall not be calculating a phase accrued along the path; instead we shall calculate the\nexponential suppression of the wave function along the straight line. This reduces the\nthree-dimensional problem to a one-dimensional problem for the motion in the direction\nv\u0302 of the velocity. The kinetic term in the \u03b1-particle Hamiltonian for the motion along\nthis axis is\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1 \u03b1\nKv\u0302 =\n1 \u2212 kjk v\u0302j v\u0302k P 2 ,\n(17)\n2m\u03b1\n2\n\nwhere P is now the one-dimensional momentum in the relevant direction. [Actually, in\nthe presence of the Lorentz violation, the directions of the momentum and the velocity\n\u03b1\n)pj . However, the difference between\ngenerally differ; the velocity is vk = m1\u03b1 (pk \u2212 12 kjk\nthe two directions only contributes a higher order correction to the penetration factor.]\nFor motion purely in the v\u0302-direction, the effect of \u0001the Lorentz violation is to modify the\n\u03b1\ninertial mass of the \u03b1-particle to m\u03b1 1 + 12 kjk\nv\u0302j v\u0302k .\nNote that this use of the eikonal approximation is only straightforward if the nucleus\nand the \u03b1-particle are in a relative S state. However, the barrier penetration factors for\nL = 0 angular momentum states are always greater than for higher angular momentum\nstates at the same energy, because for L > 0 states there is an additional centrifugal\nterm in the effective potential. Because of this (and because of the related fact that the\nwave function for two particles with relative angular momentum L > 0 vanishes when the\nparticles' positions coincide), S states frequently dominate in nuclear interaction processes,\nand we shall consider only S-wave \u03b1-decays in our calculations.\nApplying the standard WKBJ technique, the barrier penetration factor is then\n\u0014\n\u0013 Z rE\n\u0012\n\u0015\np\n\u221a\n1 \u03b1\n2\nT = \u03b2 exp \u22122 2m\u03b1 1 + kjk v\u0302j v\u0302k\ndr 2(Z \u2212 2)e2 /4\u03c0r \u2212 E ,\n(18)\n4\nrN\n\nwhere rN and rE = (Z \u2212 2)e2 /2\u03c0E are the classical turning points. rN represents the\nnuclear radius, at which the attractive nuclear potential binding the \u03b1-particle to the\nnucleus comes into play; for a nucleus containing A nucleons, rN \u2248 1.4A1/3 fm. The\nescape radius rE is the beginning of the classically allowed region outside the repulsive\nCoulomb potential. The prefactor \u03b2 2 would be negligible for a sufficiently slowly varying\n8\n\n\fpotential; while the exponential arises from the lowest order term in an expansion in\npowers of ~, \u03b2 comes from a higher order term. However, the higher order correction\nbecomes relevant in the region where the dominant potential changes rapidly from being\nthe repulsive\np Coulomb to the attractive nuclear interaction; taking it into account, we\n2\nfind \u03b2 = (rE /rN ) \u2212 1.\nThe integral in the exponent gives\n\"\n#\nr\nr\nZ\n1\n1\n1\u221a\n1\n1\n2r \u2212 rE\n\u22121\np\ndr\n=r\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\nrE tan\n.\n(19)\nr rE\nr rE 2\n2 r(rE \u2212 r)\n\nWhen E is small compared with the characteristic potential at the nucleus, (Z\u22122)e2 /2\u03c0rN ,\nthe lower limit of integration becomes relatively unimportant. This limit is equivalent to\nhaving rE \u226b rN , so that the width of the barrier region is large compared with the size\nof the nucleus. The fact that the dependence on rN in this limit is weak is fortuitous,\nsince the relevant nuclear size can only be determined approximately (and might itself be\naffected by Lorentz violation). In the rE \u226b rN regime, it is a reasonable approximation to\nset rN \u2248 0. (However, the finite size of the nucleus is an important effect in real \u03b1-decays.\nSome of the earliest measurements of the size of certain \u03b1-emitting nuclei were actually\nbased on analyses of the finite nuclear size corrections to the decay rate.)\nIn the energy regime for which the penetration factor is relatively insensitive to the\nprecise value of rN , any Lorentz violation effects in the strong force that holds the parent\nnucleus together are of lesser importance. The most crucial feature of the penetration\nfactor T is that it depends on k \u03b1 as\nT =\u03b2\n\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013 1+ 1 k\u03b1 v\u0302 v\u0302\nT0 ( 4 jk j k )\n,\n\u03b22\n\n(20)\n\nwhere \u03b2 2 T0 is the penetration factor in the absence of k \u03b1 Lorentz violation. T depends\nexponentially on k \u03b1 ; the smaller the penetration factor is, the larger the fractional dependence on the Lorentz violation will be.\nTaking the rN \u2248 0 limit in the exponent, the penetration factor becomes\n#\n\" r\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0010\n\u0011\n2\n\u221a\nm\n(Z\n\u2212\n2)e\n1\n\u03c0\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\nrE\n(21)\nT = \u03b2 2 exp \u22122\n1 + kjk\nv\u0302j v\u0302k\n\u03c0\n4\n2\nr\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n1 \u03b1\nm\u03b1\n2\n2\n= \u03b2 exp \u2212(Z \u2212 2)e\n1 + kjk v\u0302j v\u0302k ,\n(22)\n2E\n4\nwith the well-known dependence on exp(\u2212bE \u22121/2 ). The leading corrections to the exponential for finite rN are\n\"\n(\n\u0012 \u00131/2\n\u0012 \u00133/2 #)\n4\nr\nrN\n2\nN\nT = \u03b2 2 exp \u2212bE \u22121/2 1 \u2212\n.\n(23)\n+\n\u03c0 rE\n3\u03c0 rE\n9\n\n\f\u03c9\n\u03c9\nT , where 2\u03c0\nis the frequency for oscillations of the\nThe full decay rate is \u0393 = 2\u03c0\n\u03b1-particle inside the attractive nuclear potential region. The frequency gives the rate at\nwhich the \u03b1-particle strikes the inside of the Coulomb barrier, and T is the probability\nqthat\nit tunnels through and escapes during a single collision. An estimate of \u03c9 is \u03c9 \u223c r1N mE\u03b1 ;\nthis is approximately the inverse of the time which a particle with kinetic energy E and\nmass m\u03b1 takes to traverse a distance rN .\nNeither \u03b2 nor \u03c9 depend exponentially on the Lorentz violation coefficients. We therefore expect the dominant contribution of the Lorentz violation to be made through its\neffects on the exponential in T . Neglecting the Lorentz violation in the prefactor \u03b2 2 \u03c9, the\ndecay rate may be written in the simplified form\nr\n\u0013\n\u0012\n(Z \u2212 2)e2 m\u03b1 \u03b1\nk v\u0302j v\u0302k ,\n(24)\n\u0393 = \u03930 exp \u2212\n4\n2E jk\n\nwhere \u03930 is the rate in the absence of Lorentz violation. In evaluating \u03930 , many of the\napproximations (such as rN \u2248 0) that were used in our determination of the Lorentzviolating correction are not necessary. In fact, \u03930 does not need to be calculated at all; it\ncan be taken from experimental data.\n\n4\n\nComparison with Experiment\n\nWhat (24) predicts is an anisotropy in the emission of the \u03b1-particles. The decay rate\ndepends on the emission direction v\u0302. Presuming the anisotropy is a small correction,\nr\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(Z \u2212 2)e2 m\u03b1 \u03b1\n\u0393 = \u03930 1 \u2212\nk v\u0302j v\u0302k .\n(25)\n4\n2E jk\nThe effects of Lorentz violation are enhanced by the potentially large parameter\nr\n\u0013\u22121/2\n\u0012\n(Z \u2212 2)e2 m\u03b1\nE\n= 0.99(Z \u2212 2)\n.\n4\n2E\n1 MeV\n\n(26)\n\nTo detect an anisotropy, the fractional difference between the decay rates in different\ndirections must be greater than the fractional error in the measured rate\n\u221a due to random\nerrors. If N counts are collected, the signal to noise ratio goes as N, and repeated\nmeasurements made on the same isotope can produce bounds on k \u03b1 that scale as N \u22121/2 .\nTo measure an anisotropy in \u0393 is, in principle, straightforward. A sample of decaying\nmaterial should be placed inside a detector that would identify the directions of any outgoing \u03b1-particles. This directional data would be used to search for evidence of anisotropy.\nOf course, in a laboratory located on the Earth, the planet's rotation must be accounted\nfor in any absolute directional measurement. The direction of each decay in the laboratory\n10\n\n\fcoordinates must be re-expressed in a non-rotating coordinate system. There is a particular sun-centered celestial equatorial coordinate system of this nature, in which bounds\non Lorentz-violating coefficients are conventionally expressed. The conversion between\nlaboratory and sun-centered coordinates is obviously dependent on the sidereal time, and\nso the time associated with each decay event must be recorded along with its direction.\nDetails of the sun-centered coordinates are given in [50].\nIn practice, the kind of experiment described here could be tricky. For example, it is\ndesirable to have a small physical sample, so that rescattering of \u03b1-particles produced by\ndecays well inside the sample could be minimized. The ideal \u03b1-emitter for these purposes\nis one whose half-life is well known, which has only one major decay mode, and which has\nnuclear spin I = 0 and decays into another I = 0 nucleus. The spin condition is important\nfor two reasons. First, having both the parent and daughter nuclei spinless (as well as\nthe \u03b1-particle) ensures that the decay proceeds via an S-wave tunneling state. Second, if\nthe decaying isotope had a nonzero spin, then a slight polarization of the population of\nparent nuclei could lead to a small anisotropy in the decay rate, which could depend on\nthe relative orientations of the net nuclear spin and the outgoing \u03b1-particles' trajectories.\nA nuclide with the desired properties is 222 Rn [51]. Its half-life of 3.8235 days is\nknown with a fractional 1\u03c3 error of less than 10\u22124 . 222 Rn is an I P = 0+ state, which\ndecays overwhelmingly to 218 Po, another 0+ isotope. The decay energy is 5.5903 \u00b1 0.0003\nMeV.\nIf any anisotropy in the \u03b1-decay of 222 Rn can be ruled out with the same . 10\u22124\naccuracy with which the total half-life is known, (25) and (26) dictate that the Lorentz\n\u03b1\n| . 2 \u00d7 10\u22126 (although the trace\nviolation coefficients k \u03b1 may be bounded at the level |kjk\n\u03b1\nkjj would not be constrained, since it does not lead to any anisotropy). These bounds are\nnot very strong, especially compared with the results of atomic clock experiments, but\nthey could give new constraints on neutron and proton c coefficients that have not been\nbounded in the laboratory.\nThe reason that an experiment like this would be sensitive to new coefficients is that\nthe \u03b1-decay experiment would involve the measurement of actual decay directions. The\nextremely precise clock comparison experiments instead measure energy shifts. The energy of certain transitions can vary as the angle between the laboratory magnetic field and\na background vector field changes. However, not all possible magnetic field directions are\nsampled as the Earth rotates, which is why certain coefficients are not measured. Constraints on the various coefficients which are difficult to measure in clock tests can come\nfrom cosmic ray observations, because cosmic rays coming from all possible directions\ncan potentially be observed [52]. However, these astrophysical bounds lack the certainty\nassociated with controlled laboratory measurements.\n\n11\n\n\f5\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper, we have examined Lorentz violation for composite particles, specifically\n\u03b1-particles. In low-energy physics, Lorentz violation can enter the in the \u03b1-particle sector\n\u03b1\nonly through the coefficients k\u03bc\u03bd\n. These coefficients are linear combinations of the proton\np\n\u03b1\nand neutron coefficients c\u03bd\u03bc and cn\u03bd\u03bc . In the limit of exact isospin symmetry, k\u03bc\u03bd\n= cp\u03bd\u03bc +cn\u03bd\u03bc .\nMore generally, the coefficients for the Lorentz-violating, spin-independent modification of a composite particle's nonrelativistic kinetic energy are linear combinations of the\nanalogous coefficients for its constituent particles. The weight given to each coefficient\nin this sum is determined by the fraction of the total momentum that is carried by the\ncorresponding constituent. This is the solution to a simple instance of the more general\nproblem of determining the Lorentz violation coefficients for a composite particle in terms\nof the coefficients for the constituents.\nThe example of the \u03b1-particle is especially straightforward, because it is a spin singlet\ncomposed of four extremely similar particles. It would be desirable to get an equivalent\nunderstanding of more complicated nuclei. This would be particularly useful for improving the bounds on Lorentz violation that come from clock comparison experiments. Such\nbounds are currently evaluated using extremely crude models of the nucleus. The scope\nand accuracy of the resulting bounds would be significantly improved with a better understanding of the relationship between the SME coefficients for nucleons and the hyperfine\ntransition frequencies that can actually be observed in the laboratory.\nEven trickier than the problem of relating the effective Lorentz violation coefficients\nfor nuclei to the coefficients for their hadronic constituents is that of relating the proton,\nneutron, and other hadron coefficients to the coefficients for the underlying quark and\ngluon fields. These constituents interact strongly through quantum chromodynamics, and\nthe interaction cannot be treated as a small correction. Renormalization group effects are\nalso very important; the ultimate relationship between the Lorentz violation coefficients\nfor the physical hadrons and the coefficients for the parton fields will depend sensitively\non the renormalization scale. The whole problem is quite difficult; however, the subject\nis also extremely interesting, and it represents one of the most important open problems\nconcerning the structure of the SME.\nThis paper also examined another phenomenon in quantum mechanics whose interaction with Lorentz violation has been very little studied: tunneling. In reactions, such as\n\u03b1-decay, whose rate is principally determined by a quantum barrier penetration factor T ,\nthe sensitivity to Lorentz-violating effects may be enhanced. This is a consequence of the\npenetration factor's exponential dependence on various parameters. If Lorentz violation\nleads to a small increase in the height of the potential barrier through which a particle\nmust tunnel, the tunneling rate will be diminished by an exponentially greater amount.\nWhile an experiment searching for a possible anisotropy in the emission of \u03b1-particles\nby a decaying isotope is interesting, the bounds that such an experiment might place on\nphysical Lorentz violation coefficients are not very precise. Such an experiment would be\n12\n\n\fsensitive to certain coefficients that have not previously been constrained by laboratory\nexperiments; however, the coefficients in question have been bounded at the 5 \u00d7 10\u221214\nlevel by observations of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. Constraints based on controlled\nlaboratory experiments are generally preferable to bounds based on inferences drawn from\nastrophysical data, but it is unfortunate that the laboratory tests proposed here might\nonly give bounds at the 2 \u00d7 10\u22126 level.\nHowever, this work opens the door to the possibility of constraining Lorentz violation\nwith other experiments involving tunneling. The ideal experiment for placing such constraints would have a high barrier, which would make the tunneling rate more sensitive to\nany Lorentz violations. To compensate for the low tunneling rate, a large flux of particles\nagainst the barrier would be required. If a process with the desired characteristics is\nfound, it could be used to place new bounds on coefficients for Lorentz violation.\n\nReferences\n[1] D. Colladay, V. A. Kosteleck\u00fd, Phys. Rev.
