It turned out that one way of fabricating gravity dual\nof a gauge theory with confinement is to introduce an ultraviolet cut-off. Indeed, in [10],\nthe gravity dual of the confining gauge theory on flat space was constructed by smoothly\ncapping off the geometry at small radius. A simpler model appeared in [12, 13] where the\ngravitational description consists of AdS5 with small radius region removed and this was\ntermed as a hard wall approximation. It is shown [13] that for small enough cutoff (infact,\nsmaller than the size of a black hole horizon), one obtains Hawking-Page transition at a\nfinite nonzero temperature. Introduction the cut-off in a milder way leads to a soft wall\napproximation where one uses an appropriate dilaton field in the background to truncate\nsmall radius region. However, in either cases, the short distance cutoff on the gravity side\ntranslates into an IR cutoff in the corresponding gauge theory and so the gauge theory\ndual to the gravity theory under consideration is a theory on R3 in the presence of an IR\ncutoff. Using the gravity dual one can learn various aspects of this gauge theory in the\nstrongly coupled regime. At this point one may ask: Can these lessons be used to design\nan effective theory for the strongly coupled regime of this gauge theory with IR cut-off?\nThis is essentially the point that we would like to address in the present note.\nNecessary hint comes from the consideration of the confining gauge theory on a\ncompact space, such as, S 3 . There one does not need a cut-off and radius of the threesphere provides the scale essential for confinement. Indeed an effective model for strongly\ncoupled regime of this gauge theory on S 3 was constructed in [2, 4]. This model, which\nwe call (a, b) model in the sequel, is characterized by two parameters a and b. These\nparameters, in general, depend on temperature and the 't Hooft coupling. If a, b satisfy\ncertain properties, this model reproduces the qualitative features of the phase structures\nexpected from the dual theory in the bulk. To construct an analogus model on R3 with\nan IR cutoff, we use the following route:\n\u2022 Incorporate the IR cut-off in the (a, b) model so as to describe a gauge theory\non S with an infrared cutoff.\n3\n\n\u2022 Keep the cutoff fixed and let the size of S 3 go to infinity.\nThe first step of constructing an intermediate model is easier. On generic ground, we\nexpect that, in the presence of cutoff, the parameters a and b would depend on the cutoff.\nIndeed, we find that the (a, b) model reproduces the qualitative features of gauge theory\non S 3 with cutoff if a, b depend on the cutoff in a specific way. This can be computed\nby comparing the effective potential in the gravity side with the free energy of the gauge\ntheory arising from the (a, b) model. In the absence of cutoff, a and b are monotonically\n\n1\n\n\fincreasing function of the temperature [2]. However, we find, while b remains an increasing\nfuction even in the presence of cutoff, the nature of the variation of a is sensitive to the\nmagnitude of the cutoff. The second step is more difficult. Since the radius of the threesphere does not appear as a tunable parameter, there is no simple procedure to carry out\nthis step. Comparing gravity duals of the gauge theories on S 3 and R3 respecvtively we\npropose that the effective model remains qualitatively similar. Based on this assumption\nwe have constructed an effective model. Details of the computation is presented in latter\nsections of the note. Indeed our model posseses all the qualitative features expected\nfrom the gravity side. However, it also leads to a puzzle which we address in the next\nparagraph.\nOne of the features of our effective model is that there always exists an unstable\nmaximum which separates the two minima. These two minima, in the gravity side,\nrepresent thermal AdS and black hole in presence of UV cutoff. On the other hand, one\nexpects the maximum to represent a small unstable black hole. However, for the cases\nanalysed in [13], such a black hole is missing. We suspect that this is due to the fact that\nthe cutoff was introduced by hand. Once this cutoff is intruduced, both in soft and hard\nwall models dynamically, such black hole would prehaps appear. A preliminary support\nof our proposal comes from a calculation carried out in the apendix of this paper. Here we\nanalyse a gravity action which has a fine tuned dilaton potential. If we set the dilaton to\nzero, we have a flat AdS black hole. The temperature of this black hole increases linearly\nwith the horizon size. However, as we turn on a dilaton profile and the dilaton potential (\nsatisfying the BF bound), we see that for a given temperature, there can have two black\nholes \u2013 one of which is unstable.\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. In section (2), we analyze the gravity theory\nwith a radial cutoff. In section (3), we consider the zero coupling limit of gauge theory\nwith an IR cutoff. In section (4), we study the behaviour of the phenomenological matrix\nmodel on S 3 with an IR cutoff. Next section, (5), consists of analysis of the model as we\ntake the size of S 3 to infinity, keeping the cutoff fixed. This paper ends with a discussion\nof our results. Finally, in the appendix, we show, with in the soft wall model, how an\nunstable black hole may appear if we introduce cutoff dynamically. This is a prediction\nthat arise from an analysis of our martix model of R3 .\n\n2\n\nBulk with UV cutoff\n\nWe begin this section, with gravitational configuration having boundary S 3 \u00d7 S 1 and its\nthermodynamic properties the presence of an UV cutoff. In the latter part of this section,\nwe take a suitable limit to obtain gravitational configuration having boundary R3 \u00d7 S 1\nand study its analogous properties.\n2\n\n\f\u2022 Gravitational configuration with boundary S 3 \u00d7 S 1\nFive dimensional gravity action with a negative cosmological constant is given by,\nZ\n\u221a \u0010\n12 \u0011\n1\n(2.1)\nS = 2 d5 x \u2212g R + 2 ,\n2\u03ba\nl\nwhere \u03ba2 is the five dimensional gravitational constant and l2 parametrizes the cosmological constant. This action admits two solutions with same asymptotic behaviour: AdS\nand AdS black hole. For both, the metric can be written as\ndS 2 = \u2212V (r)dt2 + V (r)\u22121 dr 2 + r 2 d\u03a923 .\n\n(2.2)\n\nWhile for AdS, V (r) is\nr2\n,\nl2\n\n(2.3)\n\nr2 m\n\u2212 2.\nl2\nr\n\n(2.4)\n\nV (r) = 1 +\nfor the AdS black hole it has the form\nV (r) = 1 +\n\nIn the last equation m is associated to the ADM mass of the black hole and is given by\nM=\n\n3\u03c93 m\n,\n\u03ba2\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhere \u03c93 is the volume of the unit three-sphere. In the asymptotic limit, r \u2192 \u221e, the\nmetric becomes the AdS metric. The black hole has a curvature singularity at r = 0 and\nhas a single horizon. The horizon radius r+ can be obtained by setting V (r) = 0 and is\ngiven by the real positive root of\n1\u2212\n\nm r2\n+ 2 = 0.\nr2\nl\n\n(2.6)\n\nVarious thermodynamic quantities for the black hole with an UV cutoff is given\nin [14]. Continuing to Euclidean signature, with time direction as a circle, one finds that\nsmoothness of the geometry at non-zero r requires the radius of the time circle to vanish\nat horizon. This leads to a temperature,\nT =\n\n2\n2r+\n+ l2\n,\n2\u03c0r+ l2\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhich is independent of the cutoff. There is a critical temperature T0 , termed as nucleation\ntemperature, below which there is no black hole. For T > T0 there are two black hole\nsolutions - an unstable small black hole and a stable big black hole with horizon radius\ngiven by the smaller and larger root of r+ respectively. They merge at T = T0 .\n\n3\n\n\fThe free energy of the system is obtained by integrating the regularized action for\nAdS space and the black hole over the amputated space where a small three-sphere of\nradius r0 is removed from the origin and so the lower limit of the integration on the radial\ncoordinate is r = r0 instead of the origin r = 0. Imposing same asymptotic boundary\ncondition for both the geometries and choosing the free energy of the AdS to be zero, one\ncan obtain the free energy associated with the black hole as [14],\n\u0011\n\u03c93 \u0010 4\n4\n2 2\n\u2212 r+\n\u2212 2r04 \u2212 r+\nl .\n(2.8)\nF = \u2212 2 2 2rmax\n2\u03ba l\nHere we choose\n\nrmax = r+\n\nfor r0 < r+\n\n(2.9)\n\nrmax = r0\n\nfor r0 > r+ .\n\n(2.10)\n\nHawking-Page (HP) transition occurs only if r0 < r+ as only in this case the free energy\n(2.8) changes sign. In terms of Wilson loop operator, one can see that unless r0 < r+ ,\nthere is no world-sheet belonging to zero homotopy group which ends on the temperature\ncircle at the asymptotic infinity. Consequently, Wilson loop operator does not show a\nphase transition. The same conclusion is reported in [13]. At this point it may appear in\nmind that since cut-off is within the horizon thermodynamic quantities are not affected\nby it. Indeed we will see the critical exponents do not depend on the cut-off.\nSince we are interested in comparing the thermodynamic behaviour with that of the\nmatrix model counterpart coming from gauge theory, where the order parameter is the\nmoment of the vev of the Wilson loop operator, we restrict ourselves to r0 < r+ . The\nsituation for r0 \u2265 r+ is considered in [14]. The entropy of this sytem turns out to be\nS=\n\n3\n2\u03c0\u03c93 r+\n,\n\u03ba2\n\n(2.11)\n\nand does not depend on the cutoff.\nIn order to summarize different phases in a convenient way ( which will help us\nin later sections to make a comparison with the matrix model ), we construct a Landau\nfunction. This reproduces equations (2.7, 2.8, 2.11) on shell. First, we define the following\ndimensionless quantitites\nr0\n\u03ba2\nr+\n= r\u0304, = r\u03040 , T l = T\u0304 , 3 = \u03ba\u03042 .\nl\nl\nl\n\n(2.12)\n\nThen, by identifying the horizon radius r\u0304 as the order parameter, it is easy to write down\nthe Landau function F (r\u0304, r\u03040 , T\u0304 ) as,\n\u0001\n\u03c93 \u0010\nF\u0304 (r\u0304, r\u03040 , T\u0304 ) = 2 3r\u0304 4 \u2212 4\u03c0 T\u0304 r\u0304 3 + 3r\u0304 2 + 2r\u030404 ,\n(2.13)\n2\u03ba\u0304\n4\n\n\fwhere F\u0304(r\u0304, r\u03040 , T\u0304 ) = lF (r\u0304, r\u03040 , T\u0304 ). On shell, this function reduces to the expression of free\nenergy given in (2.8). In order to see this, we need to compute the on shell temperature,\nwhich can be obtained by setting first variation of Landau function with respect to the\norder parameter r\u0304 equal to zero. The result matches with (2.7). Then substituting it in\n(2.13) we get (2.8). We plot the Landau function for various temperatures with three\ndifferent values of cutoff. The critical temperature corresponds to having two degenerate\nminima of F . This can be determined as follows. The function F vanishes when the\nright hand side in equation (2.13) is identically equal to zero. This, in turn, gives an\nequation for T involving r\u0304 and r\u03040 . Equating this with (2.7), we get r\u0304 in terms of r\u03040 . Upon\nsubstituting this r\u0304 in (2.7), we finally get the critical temperature as\np\n2 + 1 + 8r\u030404\nT\u0304c = \u221a q\n.\n(2.14)\np\n4\n2\u03c0 1 + 1 + 8r\u03040\nF\n0.5\n\nF\nT\n.4375\n.4775\n.4875\n\n0.5\n\n0.3\n\nF\nT\n.4385\n.4785\n.4885\n\n0.5\n\n0.3\n0.1\n\n0.3\n\n0.1\n0.5\n\n0.8\n\n1.1\n\n1.4\n\nT\n.441\n.481\n.491\n\n0.1\n\nr\n0.5\n\n0.8\n\n1.1\n\n1.4\n\nr\n\n0.5\n\n0.8\n\n1.1\n\n1.4\n\nFigure 1: The plot of the Landau function F with r\u0304 for various temperatures with r0 = 0.2, 0.3\n\nand 0.4 from left to right.\n\nFrom the plots we observe that the transition temperature increases with the cutoff.\nWe will see that a similar behaviour occurs on the gauge theory side as well. Nevertheless, the qualitative features remain independent of the cutoff. In addition, we find that\nthe critical behaviour around the nucleation temperature (T0 ), is universal and does not\ndepend on details of the model. A computation of the specific heat near the nucleation\ntemperature, T0 shows that it diverges as (T \u2212 T0 )\u22121/2 . The critical exponent is thus\nunaffected by the presence of the cutoff.\n\u2022 Gravitational configuration with boundary R3 \u00d7 S 1\nHaving discussed the gravitational configurations with boundary S 3 \u00d7 S 1 in the\npresence of an ultraviolate cutoff, we now review the case where the boundary is R3 \u00d7 S 1 .\nThis can simply be obtained by appropriate scaling of the coordinates and the parameters\nthat are involved in the previous geometries.

The confined phase of the gauge theory corresponds to a thermal AdS\ngeometry in the bulk. We thus compute the Wilson loop by computing the area of the\ndual world sheet extending into the bulk AdS space following [15, 16].

The full energy of the configuration is given by the contribution from the sections\nof the curve \"AB\" plus \"BC\", shown in figure (3).\nThe contribution from \"AB\" is given by inserting the solution (2.25) into (2.23),\n\"Z\n!\n#\n\u221e\nU0\ny2\np\nEAB =\n\u2212 1 dy \u2212 1 .\n(2.26)\n2\u03c0 1\ny4 \u2212 1\n\nThis contribution goes as the inverse power of L, because from (2.25), U0 \u223c R2 /(L/2\u2212x0 ).\n\"BC\" is the straight vertical line at U = U0 , the contribution from which is given by\nevaluating (2.23) along this line,\nEBC =\n\n1\nU2\n[L \u2212 L0 ] . 02 ,\n4\u03c0\nR\n\n(2.27)\n\nwhere, in equation (2.27), L0 /2 = L/2 \u2212 x0 .

For N = 4 SYM on S 3 we do not\nexpect to get such a linear potential and hence a string tension. This potential has been\nrecently computed in [19]. Though the nature of phase transition in the two cases - that\nis one on finite S 3 and the other on R3 with a cutoff are similar, the behavior of the\npotential before and after the transitions seem to be quite different in the two cases.\nLet us note that the string tension vanishes as the cutoff is taken to zero in equation\n(2.29). This is expected because, in this case, the theory is same as that of one on\nthe three-sphere with the radius of the sphere taken to infinity where we only have the\ncoulombic term in the potential. Finally, if we consider the theory on S 3 with an additional\ncutoff, this R3 result can also be thought of arising when L/RS 3 << 1, where RS 3 is the\nradius of the three-sphere.\n\n3\n\nEffective model at zero coupling with IR cutoff\n\nIn this section, we discuss an effective model obtained from gauge theory on a three-sphere\nin presence of an IR cut-off. A three-sphere provides a natural scale which translates into\nconfinement scale and in view of that it may appear superfluous to consider an additional\ncut-off. However, as emphasized in the introduction this model is an intermediate step\nto construct an effective theory for strongly coupled gauge theory in R3 in presence of\nan IR cut-off. Before we move to the discussion of the boundary gauge theory at strong\ncoupling, in this section we will begin with the partition function of N = 4 U(N) super\nYang-Mills theory at zero coupling on a three-sphere with an IR cutoff following [4]. The\nfield content of the theory consists of vector bosons, scalar bosons and fermions all in\nadjoint representation of U(N). We expand various fields into spherical harmonic modes\non the three-sphere leading to a quantum mechanical system consisting of infinite number\nof degrees of freedom. The non-zero modes lead to massive degrees of freedom and it turns\nout that the zero modes are also massive in this problem. The fermionic zero modes are\nmassive because of anti-periodic boundary condition around the temperature circle and\nthe scalar zero modes are massive due to their coupling with the Ricci scalar of the threesphere. Since we set the coupling to zero these degrees of freedom can be thought of as\ninfinite number of decoupled harmonic oscillators each in the adjoint representation of\nU(N). They can be either bosonic or fermionic depending on their parent field. Any\nexcitation of this system, then, composed of single particle states corresponding to the\nvarious oscillator modes and a general physical state can be obtained by acting with an\narbitrary collection of these oscillators on the Fock space vacuum. However, the Gauss's\n9\n\n\flaw does not allow any non-singlet state to be physical. So while considering physical\nexcitations we need to consider those which are singlets of U(N).\nWe begin with the partition function for bosonic modes in adjoint representation\nof U(N). Single particle modes are denoted by i with energy Ei . A generic state is\nrepresented by a set of integers {ni } where ni is the level of i'th mode and so with energy\n\u221e\nP\nni Ei . The corresponding partition function can be written as\ni=0\n\nZ(x) =\n\n\u221e\nYX\n\nxni Ei S(ni ),\n\n(3.1)\n\nni =0\n\ni\n\nwhere S(ni ) represent number of singlet states in a symmetric product of ni number of\nparticles in adjoint representation, which takes care of the fact that we are summing over\nphysical states only. Since number of singlet in any representation can be obtained by\nintegrating the character of that representation over the group manifold, we write\nZ\nS(n) = [dU]\u03c7symn (adj) .\n(3.2)\nWe substitute this integral expression in (3.1) to obtain\nZ\n\u221e\nYX\nZ(x) = [dU]\nxni Ei \u03c7symni (adj) .\ni\n\n(3.3)\n\nni =0\n\nAs shown in the appendix of [4], this expression reduces to\n\"\n#\nZ\n\u221e\nXX\n1 mEi\nZ(x) = [dU] exp\nx tr(U m )tr((U \u2020 )m ) ,\nm\ni m=1\n\n(3.4)\n\nwhere we use \u03c7adj = tr(U)tr(U \u2020 ) and the tr implies trace in the fundamental representation. We can carry out a partial sum over all single particle states associated with a\nparticular field. There could be different single particle partition functions for scalars and\nvectors. For the time being we assume only one kind and write single particle partition\nP Ei\nfunction as z(x) =\nx . The above partition function in (3.4)reduces to\ni\n\nZ(x) =\n\nZ\n\n#\n\u221e\nX\n1\nzB (xm )tr(U m )tr((U \u2020 )m ) .\n[dU] exp\nm\nm=1\n\"\n\n(3.5)\n\nA similar computation can be done for the fermionic fields also (see [4] for details) where\nthe symmetric product in (3.1) is replaced by antisymmetric product. Considering both\nthe bosons and the fermions we obtain the total partition function as\n#\n\" \u221e\nZ\nX 1\n[zB (xm ) + (\u22121)m+1 zF (xm )]tr(U m )tr((U \u2020 )m ) ,\n(3.6)\nZ(x) = [dU] exp\nm\nm=1\n10\n\n\fwhere zB and zF are bosonic and fermionic single particle partition function respectively.\nIf we have nB number of bosonic fields and nF number of fermionic field the expression in\nthe square bracket in (3.6) will be replaced by nB zB (xm )+(\u22121)m+1 nF zF (xm ). In addition,\nif there are two kinds of bosonic fields, such as, nv number of vector fields and ns number\nof scalar fields the term becomes nv zv (xm ; R) + ns zs (xm ; R) + (\u22121)m+1 nF zF (xm ) where zv\nand zs are single particle partition function for vector and scalar fields.\n\u221e\nP\n\ni=0\n\nIn presence of a cutoff \u01eb we will consider the states, with energy satisfying the bound\nni Ei \u2265 \u01eb0 .

Using\nthe integral representation\n\u03b8(x) =\n\nZ\u221e\n\ndk ikx\ne ,\nk\n\n(3.8)\n\n0\n\nwe can rewrite the partition function as\nZ\n\u221e\ndk \u2212ik\u01eb0 Y X\nZ(x; \u01eb0 ) =\ne\n(xeik )ni Ei S(ni ),\nk\ni ni =0\nZ\ndk \u2212ik\u01eb0\ne\nZ(xeik ).\n=\nk\n\n(3.9)\n(3.10)\n\nThen following the similar procedure as above we can write the partition function with\ncutoff from (3.4) by replacing zB and zF by zB\u01eb0 and zF\u01eb0 respectively\n\" \u221e\n#\nZ\nX 1\n\u01eb0\nm\nm+1 \u01eb0\nm\nm\n\u2020 m\nZ(x; \u01eb0 ) = [dU] exp\n[z (x ) + (\u22121)\nzF (x )]tr(U )tr((U) ) ) , (3.11)\nm B\nm=1\nwhere zB\u01eb0 and zF\u01eb0 are bosonic and fermionic single particle partition functions respectively\nwith cutoff \u01eb0 . Both of them have the general form\nZ\ndk \u2212ik\u01eb0\n\u01eb0\nz (x) =\ne\nz(xeik ).\n(3.12)\nk\nA formal path-integral derivation of the partition function for Yang-Mills theory at\nzero coupling is done in [4] and turn out to give rise to the same partition function as\nin (3.6). All the modes once again gets massive and can be systematically integrated\nout. The only massless mode that remains in the spectrum is the zero mode associated\nwith A0 around the thermal cycle. Thus the group theoretic quantity N1 T r(U) actually\n11\n\n\frepresents Polyakov loop operator around thermal cycle and serves as an order parameter.\nIn presence of cutoff the generalization of computation of partition function in a pathintegral formulation is very similar and so we are not repeating that here. One will get\nthe same result as (3.6).\nThe only variable in this effective action is an N \u00d7 N unitary matrix and thus we\nhave arrived at an effective matrix model. Following [4] we rewrite it in terms of the\neigenvalues of U as {e\u03b1i } where \u03b1i 's are within the range (\u2212\u03c0 < \u03b1i \u2264 \u03c0) and obtain a\nsystem of eigenvalues distributed over a circle. The measure can be rewritten in terms of\nthe eigenvalues as\nZ\n\n\u03c0\n\n[dU] \u2192\n\nYZ\n\n[d\u03b1i ]\n\nY\n\nsin2 (\n\ni<j\n\ni \u2212\u03c0\n\n\u03b1i \u2212 \u03b1j\n).\n2\n\n(3.13)\n\nWe make the substitution\ntr(U n ) \u2192\n\nX\n\nein\u03b1j ,\n\n(3.14)\n\nj\n\nin the action and write down the partition function as\nZ\nX\nZ(x; \u01eb0 ) = [d\u03b1i ] exp[\u2212\nV0\u01eb (\u03b1i \u2212 \u03b1j )],\n\n(3.15)\n\ni6=j\n\nwhere\n\u221e\nX\n1 \u01eb0 n\nV (\u03b1) = \u2212 log | sin(\u03b1/2)| \u2212\n[zB (x ) + (\u22121)n+1 zF\u01eb0 (xn )] cos(n\u03b1).\nn\nn=1\n\u01eb0\n\n(3.16)\n\nThe temperature independent repulsive potential is independent of cutoff and the attractive potential, which monotonically increases with temperature, decreases as the value\nof cutoff increases. That is what we expect because increasing the cutoff amounts to\ndiscarding lower powers of x in a Taylor series expansion of zB (x) and zF (x) and so the\nattractive potential dominates over the repulsive potential at higher value of x.\nThis system of eigenvalues shows two different phases in terms of the eigenvalue\ndistribution as order parameter. At low temperature the repulsive potential dominates\nand the eigenvalues tend to be distributed uniformly over the circle \u2212\u03c0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 \u03c0. As\ntemperature increases the attractive potential gets stronger and at some critical temperature the eigenvalues tend to clump together signalling a phase transition as happens in\nabsence of cutoff. Since attractive potential decreases with cutoff while repulsive potential\nis independent of it, the phase transition temperature increases. Introducing the eigenR\u03c0\nvalue distribution function, \u03c1(\u03b1), normalized as d\u03b1\u03c1(\u03b1) = 1 the effective action can be\n\u2212\u03c0\n\n12\n\n\fwritten as\nS[\u03c1(\u03b1)] = N\n\n2\n\nZ\n\nd\u03b1\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\nN2 X\nd\u03b2\u03c1(\u03b1)\u03c1(\u03b2)V (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2) =\n|\u03c1n |2 Vn\u01eb0 ,\n2\u03c0 n=1\n\u01eb0\n\n(3.17)\n\nR\nwhere \u03c1n := d\u03b1\u03c1(\u03b1) cos(n\u03b1) represents moments of \u03c1 and the moments of potential\nR\nVn = d\u03b1V (\u03b1) cos(n\u03b1) are\nVn\u01eb0 =\n\n2\u03c0\n(1 \u2212 zB\u01eb0 (xn ) \u2212 (\u22121)n+1 zF\u01eb0 (xn )).\nn\n\n(3.18)\n\nFrom (3.17) we see the uniform distribution is minimum when Vn\u01eb0 > 0. As we increase\nthe temperature it is V1 which reaches the zero first and so the uniform distribution\nwill be destabilized. Setting V1\u01eb0 (xH ) = 0 we get at x = xH zB\u01eb0 (xH ) + zF\u01eb0 (xH ) = 1.\nThis temperature is identified with the Hagedorn temperature of the corresponding gauge\ntheory. The coefficients zB and zF depends on the bosonic and fermionic matter contents\nrespectively. In particular, for N = 4 SYM, in which we are interested, the single particle\npartition functions are given by\nzB (x) =\n\n6x + 12x2 \u2212 2x3\n,\n(1 \u2212 x)3\n\nzF (x) =\n\n16x3/2\n.\n(1 \u2212 x)3\n\n(3.19)\n\nFrom this expression, using (3.1) we can calculate zB\u01eb0 and zF\u01eb0 respectively. We have\nplotted the Hagedorn temperature for free N = 4 SYM against the cutoff and observe\nthat the temperature decreases with increase in cutoff.\nx\n1\n0.7\n0.5\n0.3\n0.2\n1\n\n5 10\n\n50 100\n\nn\n5001000\n\nFigure 4: The plot of xH = e\u2212(1/TH ) with cutoff \u01eb0 = n. For convenience we have used a LogLog\nPlot.\n\n4\n\nEffective model at strong coupling on S 3 with IR\n\nIn the last section we briefly reviewed the derivation of the matrix model associated\nwith an N = 4 SYM theory with an IR cutoff on a three-sphere at zero coupling. In\n13\n\n\forder to compare with gravity we need to go to the strongly coupled regime. Let us\nbegin considering the analogous analysis [2, 4] in absence of cutoff. At weak coupling the\nPolyakov loop operator will remain the only massless mode and one can write down an\neffective action by integrating all other modes out. The effective action cannot be written\nin a closed form a priory, but from the requirement of gauge invariance and Gauss's law\none can show that it will contain terms like tr(U n1 )...tr(U nk )tr(U \u2212n1 \u2212...\u2212nk ). As evident\nfrom (3.17) at weak coupling mass of n-th moment of distribution function \u03c1 is given by\nVn . Since at a fixed temperature V1 is the smallest, we expect that \u03c11 = N1 tr(U) would be\nthe lightest mode. So at weak coupling it is possible to integrate out all other moments\nand write down an effective action in terms of \u03c11 only. One extrapolates this to strong\ncoupling and assumes so far the universal features of the system is concerned, one can\nwrite down an effective matrix model action quadratic in \u03c11 with coefficients depending\non the temperature the 't Hooft coupling \u03bb.\nOn the basis of the above arguments a matrix model consisting of a unitary matrix\nwas introduced in [2]. The partition function and effective action are given by\nZ\nZ(\u03bb, T ) =\ndUeSef f (U ) ,\n(4.1)\n\u00112\nb(\u03bb, T ) \u0010\n\u2020\ntr (U) tr (U)\n,\nSef f (U) = a(\u03bb, T )tr (U) tr (U) +\nN2\n\u2020\n\n(4.2)\n\nrespectively, which involves the order parameter characterising the deconfined phase of\nthe gauge theory given by the expectation value of the Polyakov loop (1/N) htrUi. The\nequations of motion that follows from the action can be written as,\na\u03c1 + 2b\u03c13 = \u03c1\n=\n\n1\n4(1 \u2212 \u03c1)\n\n1\n0\u2264\u03c1\u2264 ,\n2\n1\n\u2264 \u03c1 \u2264 1,\n2\n\n(4.3)\n\nwhere \u03c12 = (1/N 2 )trUtrU \u2020 . For later use let us note that the equations of motion can\nbe integrated in the form of a potential. In particular, for \u03c1 > 1/2 the potential can be\nwritten as\nV (\u03c1) = 2a\u03c12 + 2b\u03c14 + log(1 \u2212 \u03c1) + f,\n(4.4)\nwhere we have added a constant, f = log(2) \u2212 1/2 to make the potential continuous at\n\u03c1 = 1/2.\nConsidering this model as an effective theory in the strong coupling regime, the\nphases were studied in [2]. It was shown that this model undergoes two phase transitions\nas a function of temperature. There is a first and a third order transition when b > 0 and\na < 1. The thermal history matches with that of the bulk gravity as long as both a and\nb are increasing functions of temperature. The first order transition can be mapped to\nthe HP transition between thermal AdS and the big black hole. It was further proposed\n14\n\n\fthat the third order transition corresponds to the black-hole string transition for the small\nblack hole. This transition is not visible in the gravity approximation of string theory.\nSince on the gravity side, turning on the cutoff does not lead to any drastic change\nin the thermodynamic behaviour it is a reasonable assumption that the above arguments\nleading to the quadratic matrix model effective action will remain valid for non-zero cutoff\nand it is possible to describe the thermodynamic behaviour with the effective action given\nin (4.2), where the coefficients a and b will depend on the value of the cutoff as well.\nIn what follows, we analyse this matrix model and comparing with the results obtained\nfrom gravity side we study the behavior of the coefficients a and b as functions of infrared\ncutoff. For convenience we write the cutoff parameter as \u039bIR , which is related to the\ncutoff r0 on the gravity side through the relation \u039bIR l2 \u223c r0 .\nWe now use a method similar to [7] in order to study the temperature dependence\nof a, b at various IR cutoffs. Subsequently, we discuss, with a mild assumption, how this\nmethod also allow us to find \u03bb dependence of a and b at fixed temperature. The procedure\nis as follows. On the matrix model side, at a generic temperature, there are two saddle\npoints arising as the solution of (4.3). Of which the unstable one (maximum) corresponds\nto the small black hole and the stable one (minimum) corresponds to the large black hole\non the gravity side. We identify the matrix model potential at maximum and minimum\nwith the gravity action evaluated with the smaller and larger values of horizon radius\nrespectively. That will lead to the following two equations\n2a\u03c121 + 2b\u03c141 + log(1 \u2212 \u03c11 ) + f = \u2212I1 (r0 ),\n2a\u03c122\n\n+\n\n2b\u03c142\n\n+ log(1 \u2212 \u03c12 ) + f = \u2212I2 (r0 ),\n\n(4.5)\n(4.6)\n\nwhere the I1,2 (r0 ) are the actions for the large and small black-holes respectively and\n\u03c11,2 are the corresponding solutions in the matrix model. Since we need the black hole\nsolutions on the gravity side and the saddle points on the matrix model these equations are\nvalid at T > T0 . At the black hole nucleation point, where T = T0 , above two equations\nconverges into one. Therefore we can begin from an input value of a(T0 ) while b(T0 ) will\nbe determined by that equation. In addition to (4.5,4.6) \u03c11 and \u03c12 satisfy the saddle point\nequation (4.3) as well which leads to two more equations one for each of them.\n1\n,\n4(1 \u2212 \u03c11 )\n1\n.\na\u03c12 + 2b\u03c132 =\n4(1 \u2212 \u03c12 )\na\u03c11 + 2b\u03c131 =\n\n(4.7)\n(4.8)\n\nThis set of four equations given by (4.5,4.6,4.7,4.8) can be used numerically to eliminate\n\u03c11 , \u03c12 , and to solve for a and b. 2 and thus provide the temperature dependence of a and\nb.\n2\n\nWe have set l, \u03c93 , \u03ba5 to 1 in the numerical computations.\n\n15\n\n\fThe variations of a and b as function of temperature for various values of r0 are\nshown in figures (5). In absence of cutoff both a(T ) and b(T ) are monotonically increasing\nfunction of temperature as shown in [2]. From figure (5) we observe that b(T ) remains a\nmonotonically increasing function of T for all non-zero values of the cutoff r0 . However,\nfrom figure we find that a(T ) increases slowly for r0 < 0.1. It becomes a decreasing\nfunction of temperature for higher values of the cutoff. This is somewhat puzzling from\nthe following point of view. At zero coupling, a(T ) has an interpretation of a single particle\npartition function. This increases with temperature. Thus one expects, even at a very\nweak coupling, a(T ) would remain a monotonically increasing function of temperature.\nIn the absence of cutoff, we have also seen in [7] that the gravity data suggests a(T )\ncontinues to increase with T even in the strong coupling. In view of this one may have\nexpected similar behaviour of a(T ) even in the presence of a cutoff. However, what we\nfind here does not match with this expectation.\n0.35\n\n1.7\n\n1.6\n0.3\n1.5\n0.25\n1.4\n0.2\nb(T)\n\na(T)\n\n1.3\n\n1.2\n\n0.15\n\n1.1\n0.1\n\nr0=0.0\nr0=0.1\nr0=0.2\nr0=0.3\nr0=0.4\n\n0.05\n\nr0=0.0\nr0=0.1\nr0=0.2\nr0=0.3\nr0=0.4\n\n1\n\n0.9\n\n0\n0.45\n\n0.455\n\n0.46\n\n0.465\n\n0.47\n\n0.475\n\n0.48\n\n0.485\n\n0.49\n\n0.8\n0.45\n\n0.495\n\nTemperature (T)\n\n0.455\n\n0.46\n\n0.465\n\n0.47\n\n0.475\n\n0.48\n\n0.485\n\n0.49\n\n0.495\n\nTemperature (T)\n\nFigure 5: Plot of a(T ) and b(T ) for various values of cutoff r0\nIn the figure (6), we plot the thermal paths in the (a \u2212 b) space with b along the\nvertical-axis. Each dot in the figure has the coordinate a(T ) and b(T ) for a given value\nof cutoff r0 . the line \"N\" denotes the \"Nucleation\" point (a(T0 ), b(T0 )) of the blackholes\nin the (a \u2212 b) paremeter space. Similarly, line \"D\" is the\"Deconfinement\" transition line\ncorresponds to (a(TH ), b(TH )). For a given value of cutoff, the dot moves upward with\nincreasing temperature begining from the nucleation line. All dots on the nucleation line\nare at the same temperature independent of cutoff since the nucleation temperature of\nblack holes in the bulk is unaffected by the cutoff while it is different on the deconfinement\nline.\nFrom the plot, following the dots along the path, one can see that deconfinement\ntemperature increases with increasing r0 . From the matrix model side, it can be seen\nthat as cutoff increases the deconfinement temperature will increase as long as b remains\nan increasing function. We can compare this with the zero coupling situation.

The direction of flow as the\ntemperature increases is from bottom towards top. The vertical axis is b.\n\ntransition temperature is determined by a(T ) = 1. As we raise the value of the cutoff,\na(T ) increases more and more slowly with temperature and as a result the transition\ntemperature increases. The free case can be thought of as a flow of a(T ) along the\nhorizontal axis where b = 0.\nThe theory in this section has three scales, the temperature \u03b2, the radius of the\nsphere RS 3 and the cutoff Rc (which is related inversely to r0 from the gauge/gravity\nduality). a and b are thus functions of two dimensionless quantities: \u03b2/Rc and \u03b2/RS 3 .\nHowever it can be seen from Figure (5) that the terms containing RS2 3 /(\u03b2Rc ) dominate\nover the other dimensionless quantities. For fixed RS 3 , both a and b scale with respect to\n\u03b2 in the same way as the cutoff r0 . This dependence on two dimensionless combinations\nis in contrast to the theory without the cutoff with boundary S 3 \u00d7 S 1 or the one with\nflat boundary and a cutoff. In the latter cases the free energy in gravity and hence the\nparameters a and b show much simpler dependence on the scales.\nThe critical exponent around the nucleation temperature, T = T0 for this matrix\nmodel has been calculated in [2]. This is obtained by expanding the effective potential\n(4.4) in powers of (T \u2212 T0 )/T0 . As there is no explicit dependence of the parameters on\nthe cutoff here, the critical exponents thus remain the same. This is consistent with what\nwe found in gravity, that the various critical exponents are insensitive to the cutoff.\n\n17\n\n\f2\n\n0.7\n\n1.8\n\n0.6\n\n1.6\n\n0.5\n\n1.4\n\nb(T)\n\na(T)\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n1.2\n\n1\n\nr0=0.0\nr0=0.1\nr0=0.2\nr0=0.3\nr0=0.4\n\n0.2\n\nr0=0.0\nr0=0.1\nr0=0.2\nr0=0.3\nr0=0.4\n\n0.8\n\n0.1\n\n0.6\n\n0\n\n0.4\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\nTemperature (T)\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\nTemperature (T)\n\nFigure 7: Plots of a(T ) and b(T ) with various values of cutoff r0 for the theory on R3 \u00d7 S 1 .\nWe now use these above inputs to construct a model on R3 with an infrared cutoff.\nThis is the subject of the next section.\n\n5\n\nEffective model at strong coupling on R3 with IR\n\nHaving discussed the theory on S 3 with an additional IR cutoff, let us now study its\nbehavior as we take the radius of S 3 to infinity keeping the IR cutoff fixed. The effective\ntheory with two parameters (a, b) serves as phenomenological model for the theory on\nS 3 \u00d7 S 1 . The radius of the S 3 acts as an infrared cutoff and there is a phase transition\nat a temperature proportional to the inverse of the radius. As the radius of the sphere is\ntaken to infinity the theory is always in the deconfined phase. We have seen in section\n(2) that for a flat boundary with an IR cutoff introduced by hand also shows the same\nqualitative features as the theory on the sphere. Thus at the level of a phenomenological\nmodel, it is natural to expect that (4.2) should serve as good effective model for the\ntheory on flat space with an IR cutoff. From the point of view of the boundary theory\nthis relies on the assumption that the effective model with IR cutoff also has an expansion\nin terms of the Polyakov loop. The dimensionless quantity on which the phases of the\ntheory depend is \u03b2/Rc , where Rc is IR cutoff on the boundary. For the theory on the\nsphere Rc = RS 3 .\nThe main qualitative difference as seen from section (2) is that for the flat boundary, the gravity theory with cutoff shows only one black hole solution that exists for all\ntemperatures, whereas the theory with the boundary S 3 has two. In the latter case, the\neuclidean version of this unstable black hole serves as the bounce for the AdS to black\nhole transition. In R3 with cutoff, one may expect a similar phenomenon when we can\n18\n\n\f2\n\n1.75\n\n1.5\n\n1.25\n\n1\n\n0.75\n\nPSfrag replacements\nN\nD\na\nb\n\n0.5\n\n0.25\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nFigure 8: The thermal path in the (a \u2212 b) space for all values of the cutoff in gravity,\n(r0 ). The direction of flow as the temperature increases is from bottom towards top. The\nvertical axis is b.\n\nfind an exact solution of the Einstein's equation with an inbuilt cutoff (instead of putting\nit by hand). The Lorenzian version of the missing bounce would be an unstable black\nhole. In the appendix, we provide such a construction for the soft wall model.\nFrom the matrix model side we have seen that it is impossible to write down a\nsmooth potential that interpolates between two minima (corresponding to thermal AdS\nand the big black hole) without having an unstable maximum in between. Here in this\nanalysis we will include this unstable maximum so that it lies in the range 0 \u2264 \u03c1 \u2264 1/2.\nThe interpretation of such a saddle point is that of a stringy solution not visible in the\nsupergravity approximation. A transition to such a string phase from the black hole phase\nwas interpreted in [2, 9] as the gravity dual of the third order phase transition [20, 21] on\nthe boundary. In a complete gravity solution with cutoff we expect to see an unstable\nblack hole as mentioned in the earlier paragraph the corresponding saddle point for which\nin the matrix model would lie in the region \u03c1 > 1/2.\nTo implement this in the following numerical analysis similar to that in section (4),\nwe keep the unstable saddle point at \u03c1 = 0.49. The following plots of a and b (Figure(7))\nreflects the fact that they are functions of the dimensionless quantity \u03b2/Rc .\nFigure (8) shows the thermal path in the (a \u2212 b) space. Note that there is only one\npath for all values of r0 as against Figure (6), where we have different paths for different\n\n19\n\n\fvalues of r0 . This is primarily due to the fact that here we have only one other scale,\nthe cutoff r0 or Rc besides the temperature. So a change in r0 will keep us on the same\npath as it can be compensated by a change in temperature. The fact that the transition\ntemperature increases with r0 is thus obvious as the phases depend on the dimensionless\nratio (\u03b2r0 /l2 ). This is not so for the theory discussed in the earlier part of this section\nwhere apart from \u03b2 we had both Rc and RS 3 . In the numerical calculations here the\ncritical value of (a, b) is (0.681, 0.664). It lies on the deconfinement line (dashed line in\nFigure (8)). For r0 = 0 this value is never reached and the thermal path of a \u2212 b always\nremains above the deconfinement line. For rest of the finite values of r0 the path crosses\nthe deconfinement line and at low enough temperatures the values of a and b correspond\nto those in the confined phase. However, since the unstable maximum is always below 0.5,\nthe curve for all values of r0 never crosses the third-order (black hole-string) transition\nline (solid line in Figure (8)) from above. The thermal history for nonzero temperature\nthus starts beyond this line.\n\n6\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe analysis in this paper rests on the assumption that near the critical temperature, the\neffective theory governing the phase transitions for N = 4 SYM on S 3 and the same on\nR3 with an IR cutoff are identical. Some evidence for this assumption is obtained from\nthe phase transitions in gravity. On the gravitational side there is no phase transition\nfor a theory with boundary, R3 . The theory in this case is always in one of the phases;\nspecifically the black hole free energy is less than that of thermal AdS for all non zero\ntemperatures. However there are two ways to get a phase transition at finite temperature;\none by changing the boundary to S 3 and the other by putting a radial cutoff in gravity\nr0 , that has been discussed in section (2). These result in lifting the free energy of the\nblack hole above zero below a certain critical temperature. To this effect, the physical\nroles played by the cutoff r0 and the finite radius of the three-sphere are identical. We\nhave thus proposed that the effective matrix model (4.2) should also model the phase\ntransitions for the theory with the cutoff. Comparing with the thermodynamic behaviour\nof its gravity dual, we analyzed this matrix model. This model is parametrized by two\nparameters a and b. We have numerically calculated the variations of these parameters\nwith respect to the temperature and the cutoff. The relative behaviors of a and b with\nrespect to the scales reflect those of the free energy of gravity. While for the theory on\nS 3 with a cutoff, due to the presence of three scales (\u03b2,RS 3 and Rc ), the nature of the\nrelative dependences is not that clear, it is quite simple when we have only two scales (\u03b2\nand Rc ).\nApart from the similarities of the two configurations, there are of course certain\n20\n\n\fdifferences that we find in the analysing the response of the matrix model parameters\nto changes of temperature when considering S 3 or R3 with cutoff. For the former, the\nparameters are increasing functions of temperature (see [7]). This is not so in the latter\ncase (Figure (7)). Also, from the computation of the potential for a quark-antiquark pair,\nwe find that the potentials differ in the above two cases. These differences could be due\nto the details of the form of the free energy from gravity. A weak coupling computation\nwith an IR cutoff on the gauge theory side may shed some light on the similarities and\ndifferences of the two configurations.\n\nAcknowledgements: We would like to thank Bala Sathiapalan for discussions and for\nhis comments on the paper.

This maximum, in the gravity side,\nwould represent a small unstable black hole which is not seen in the hard wall model\nof [13]. Furthermore, on generic ground, one may expect that since in this model, there is\na transition from AdS to black hole, there should be a bounce solution. The Lorentzian\nversion of this bounce would be an unstable black hole. Can the absence of such a solution\nin thiese models be an artifact of introducing cutoff by hand? Within the framework of\nsoft wall model, we try to address this issue in the appendix. 3\nHere, we consider a toy model in five dimensions which has a dilaton along with\na non-trivial dilaton potential. This potential goes to a negative cosmological constant\nfor small value of the scalar. We construct a family of solutions for the metric with a\nsoft wall like behaviour of the dilaton. At large distance, the metric asymptotes to a flat\nAdS black hole. On the other hand, at short distance, due to dilaton backreaction, the\nmetric gets deformed from it asymptotic structure. We indeed see that this deformation\ninduces a small unstable black hole in the geometry. This perhaps suggests that had we\n3\n\nThis computations in this appendix was done along with Souvik Banerjee, Institute of Physics,\nBhubaneswar, India.\n\n21\n\n\fdynamically intoduced a cutoff in the soft wall model of [13], a small black hole would\nprehaps have showed up. However, it should be noted that, we only consider a toy model\nand it requires a fine-tuned dilaton potential.\nThe model we consider is represented by the following action\nZ\n\u0011\n\u221a \u00101\n1\nS = d5 x \u2212g R \u2212 (\u2202\u03c6)2 \u2212 V (\u03c6) .\n2\n2\n\n(A.1)\n\nWe look for classical solution of this action where the metric has the following form\n3\n\u0010\n\u0011 e2B\nX\ndS 2 = e2A \u2212 hdt2 +\ndx2i +\ndr 2 ,\nh\ni=1\n\n(A.2)\n\nwhere A, B, h are functions of r only.

Differentiating the third equation in (A.3) and using the first two,\nwe get the last equation. In this sense, there are only three independent equations. Our\nwill look for solutions of the above equations where the scalar depends on r as\n\u03c6=\n\na2\n.\nr2\n\n(A.4)\n\nand then determine A, B, h and V by solving (A.3).
