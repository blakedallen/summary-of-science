We trace the interaction processes of galaxies at intermediate redshift by measuring the irregularity of their ionized gas kinematics, and investigate these irregularities as a function of the environment (cluster versus field) and of morphological type (spiral\nversus irregular).\nMethods. We obtain the gas velocity fields by placing three parallel and adjacent VLT/FORS2 slits on each galaxy. To quantify\nirregularities in the gas kinematics, we use three indicators: the standard deviation of the kinematic position angle (\u03c3PA ), the mean\ndeviation of the line of sight velocity profile from the cosine form which is measured using high order Fourier terms (k3,5 /k1 ) and the\naverage misalignment between the kinematical and photometric major axes (\u2206\u03c6). These indicators are then examined together with\nsome photometric and structural parameters (measured from HST and FORS2 images in the optical) such as the disk scale length,\nrest-frame colors, asymmetry, concentration, Gini coefficient and M20 . Our sample consists of 92 distant galaxies. 16 cluster (z \u223c 0.3\nand z \u223c 0.5) and 29 field galaxies (0.10 \u2264 z \u2264 0.91, mean z=0.44) of these have velocity fields with sufficient signal to be analyzed.\nTo compare our sample with the local universe, we also analyze a sample from the SINGS survey.\nResults. We find that the fraction of galaxies that have irregular gas kinematics is remarkably similar in galaxy clusters and in the\nfield at intermediate redshifts (according to \u03c3PA \u2248 10%, k3,5 /k1 \u2248 30%, \u2206\u03c6 \u2248 70%). The distribution of the field and cluster galaxies\nin (ir)regularity parameters space is also similar. On the other hand galaxies with small central concentration of light, that we see in\nthe field sample, are absent in the cluster sample. We find that field galaxies at intermediate redshifts have more irregular velocity\nfields as well as more clumpy and less centrally concentrated light distributions than their local counterparts. Comparison with a SINS\nsample of 11 z \u223c 2 galaxies shows that these distant galaxies have more irregular gas kinematics than our intermediate redshift cluster\nand field sample. We do not find a dependence of the irregularities in gas kinematics on morphological type. We find that two different\nindicators of star formation correlate with irregularity in the gas kinematics.\nConclusions. More irregular gas kinematics, also more clumpy and less centrally concentrated light distributions of spiral field galaxies at intermediate redshifts in comparison to their local counterparts indicate that these galaxies are probably still in the process\nof building their disks via mechanisms such as accretion and mergers. On the other hand, they have less irregular gas kinematics\ncompared to galaxies at z \u223c 2.\nKey words. galaxies: evolution \u2013 galaxies: kinematics and dynamics \u2013 galaxies: clusters: individual: MS 0451.6\u20130305, MS 2137.32353, MS 1008.1-1224, Cl 0412-65 \u2013 galaxies: spiral\n\n1. Introduction\nGalaxy clusters are important laboratories for understanding the\norigin of different morphological types of galaxies. The main\nreason for that is the relation between local galaxy density and\nmorphological type (Dressler 1980). For nearby rich clusters,\nthe spiral galaxy fraction decreases from 80% in the field to\n60% in the cluster outskirts and to virtually zero in the core\nregion. This relation is redshift dependent and while the fraction of elliptical galaxies (\u223c 15%, Vogt et al. 2004) does not\n\u22c6\nBased on observations collected at the European Southern\nObservatory (ESO), Cerro Paranal, Chile (ESO Nos. 74.B\u20130592 &\n75.B-0187) and observations of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST No\n10635).\n\nchange with redshift, the S0 fraction increases with decreasing redshift and the spiral fraction, on the contrary, decreases\n(Couch et al. 1998). The fraction of spirals with no current star\nformation activity is significantly larger in clusters than in the\nfield (van den Bergh 1976; Poggianti et al. 1999; Couch et al.\n2001; Goto et al. 2003; Verdugo et al. 2008; Sikkema 2009).\nAlso, distant clusters have a larger fraction of star forming galaxies compared to nearby clusters (Butcher & Oemler 1978, 1984;\nEllingson et al. 2001; Kodama & Bower 2001). It is well established with these observational studies that spiral galaxies\nhave been transformed into S0s mostly in denser regions of\nthe universe. Then the question is what are the physical processes that are responsible for this morphological transformation. Several mechanisms have been proposed such as gas strip-\n\n\f2\n\nE. Kutdemir et al.: Internal kinematics of spiral galaxies in distant clusters\n\nping mechanisms: ram pressure stripping (Gunn & Gott 1972;\nQuilis et al. 2000; Kronberger et al. 2008; Kapferer et al. 2008,\n2009), viscous stripping (Nulsen 1982) and thermal evaporation (Cowie & Songaila 1977); tidal forces due to the cumulative\neffect of many weak encounters: harassment (Richstone 1976;\nMoore et al. 1998); removal of the outer gaseous halos by the\nhydrodynamic interaction with the intracluster medium (ICM)\nplus the global tidal field of the cluster: starvation (Larson et al.\n1980); mergers and strong galaxy-galaxy interactions which are\nefficient when relative velocities are low, and therefore, they\nmostly occur in galaxy groups or in the outskirts of clusters\n(Makino & Hut 1997). It is known that cluster galaxies loose\ngas because of their interactions with the ICM and as a result,\ntheir star formation gets switched off. Local studies show that\ncluster galaxies are deficient in neutral hydrogen compared to\ntheir field counterparts and that becomes significant within the\nAbell radius (Davies & Lewis 1973; Giovanelli & Haynes 1985;\nGavazzi 1987, 1989; Solanes et al. 2001). The HI distribution\nof these galaxies frequently shows asymmetries and displacement from the optical disk as well (Gavazzi 1989; Cayatte et al.\n1994; Bravo-Alfaro et al. 2000; Vogt et al. 2004). It was proposed that passive spiral galaxies in clusters might be the intermediate phase before becoming an S0 (van den Bergh 1976).\nLater on, it was argued that S0's can not be formed by removing gas from disks of spirals via mechanisms such as ram pressure stripping, since S0's have systematically larger bulge sizes\nand bulge to disk ratios (B/D) compared to spiral galaxies in\nall density regimes (Burstein 1979; Dressler 1980; Gisler 1980\nbut see also Arag\u00f3n-Salamanca 2008). Tidal interactions (e.g.\nharassment) on the other hand are expected to trigger gas accretion into the circumnuclear regions (Moore et al. 1996) and\ntherefore increase the bulge size and B/D ratio. Therefore, S0's\nmight have formed via minor mergers, harassment or a combination of the two (Dressler & Sandage 1983; Neistein et al. 1999;\nAguerri et al. 2001; Hinz et al. 2003).\nAll these discussions are pointing out that studying stellar\npopulations and morphologies of cluster galaxies is crucial in\nunderstanding the interaction processes. What about their kinematics? In the Virgo cluster, for example, half of 89 spiral galaxies that were observed by Rubin et al. (1999) turned out to have\ndisturbed gas kinematics. Mergers and tidal processes such as\nharassment are capable of causing disturbances also in stellar velocity fields (Moore et al. 1999; Mihos 2004). ICM-related processes on the other hand, even ram-pressure stripping are insufficient to be able to affect stellar kinematics of spiral galaxies\n(Quilis et al. 2000). Some attempts have been made to evaluate\nthe effectiveness of the interaction processes as a function of location in the galaxy cluster. Dale et al. (2001) measured TullyFisher Relation (TFR) residuals for 510 cluster spirals and concluded that they do not show a dependence on distance from\nthe cluster center. Moran et al. (2007b) constructed the TFR in\nboth KS and V bands for 40 cluster, 37 field spirals at intermediate redshift and found that the cluster TFR exhibits significantly\nlarger scatter than the field relation in both bands and the residuals do not show a clear trend with R/Rvir . They found that the\nTFR residuals do not correlate with the star formation rate and\ndust content. They also checked whether central surface mass\ndensity of galaxies, which can be used to probe the action of harassment, shows a trend as a function of radius. They found that\nit shows a break at approximately 1Rvir , outside of which spirals\nexhibit nearly uniformly low central density values. They argue\nthat a combination of merging in the cluster outskirts with harassment in the intermediate and inner cluster regions might ex-\n\nplain both the TFR scatter and the radial trend in density which\npersist up to 2Rvir .\nAs discussed above, galaxy evolution in clusters is rather\ncomplex, since there are several interaction mechanisms involved. To understand the nature of these mechanisms, it is\nimportant to examine together morphological and kinematical\nproperties of cluster galaxies. In this series of papers we make\nuse of both gas velocity fields and high resolution images of\ngalaxies in four intermediate-redshift clusters and their field to\ndo that. Most studies in the literature rely on long-slit data for\nidentifying kinematical disturbances. Using a velocity map enables us to have a more accurate measure of the kinematical\n(ir)regularity. A velocity field can be decomposed into velocity, position angle and inclination of circular orbits at each radius (see Krajnovi\u0107 et al. 2006). The deviation of the kinematic\nmajor axis (KMA) around its mean value and the misalignment\nbetween KMA and the photometric major axes (PMA) both indicate kinematical disturbance. We also make a simple rotating\nmodel that has the mean position angle and inclination of the\nobserved velocity map. The residual of the observed and the\nsimple rotating map is fitted with high order Fourier terms and\nthe squared sum of these terms is used as another indicator. We\nmeasure these irregularity indicators for both field galaxies and\ncluster members and compare them with each other to search for\nthe environmental imprint on gas kinematics. We then combine\nthis information with the morphological and photometric properties of these galaxies and investigate whether certain characteristics make galaxies more sensitive to environmental effects. We\nalso use the relations between intrinsic galaxy properties and efficiency of interaction processes, that are known from theory, to\ninvestigate which mechanisms are at work on the cluster galaxies\nin our sample.\nWe also investigate the evolution of field galaxies by studying their gas kinematics as a function of redshift. We measure the irregularities in their gas kinematics both at intermediate redshifts and in the local universe and compare them with\neach other. These results are then compared with the studies\nof spatially resolved gas kinematics at similar or higher redshifts: Shapiro et al. (2008, hereafter S08) analyzed gas velocity fields and velocity dispersion maps of 11 galaxies at z \u223c 2,\nobserved with SINFONI, and classified these systems into two\ncategories: merging and non-merging. They found that more\nthan 50% of these galaxies are consistent with a single rotating disk interpretation. With FLAMES at the VLT, Yang et al.\n(2008, hereafter Y08) studied 63 intermediate-mass field galaxies at 0.4 < z < 0.75. Using spatially resolved gas kinematics of\nthese objects, (2\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 3\u2032\u2032 field of view) they find that both velocity\nfields and velocity dispersion maps of 26% of these galaxies are\nincompatible with disk rotation.\nSpatially resolved velocity fields are essential for quantifying irregularities in the kinematics. Because the inclination and\nthe position angle of the orbits at each radii can be assessed\nand the velocity profile along each orbit can be analyzed and\ncompared with a simple rotating case. For Tully-Fisher studies the main problem with the long slit data is the fact that it\ncan be misleading in case the kinematic and photometric axes\nare misaligned. The conventional way of obtaining the spatially\nresolved spectra is using integral field (IFU) spectroscopy (e.g.\nS08, Y08, Puech et al. 2008). We use another approach and place\nthree parallel, adjacent VLT/FORS2 slits on each galaxy. This\nnovel method has the advantage that we can explore the velocity\nfields up to large radii (\u2248 3\u2032\u2032 , which corresponds to 16 kpc at\nz= 0.4) and it is more efficient than IFUs in terms of observing\ntime.

Our cluster selection depended on the availability of their HST/WFPC2 imaging when\nthe project was initiated in 1999. See Ziegler et al. 2003, hereafter Paper I and J\u00e4ger et al. 2004, hereafter Paper II for more\ndetailed information about the sample selection.\n\nFig. 1. Distribution of H\u03b1 luminosities of both our galaxies and\na local sample from SINGS.\nand 0.\u2032\u2032 25 respectively. We described our method and presented\nthe analysis of our MS 0451 sample in Kutdemir et al. (2008,\nhereafter Paper III). Here, we include in our analysis galaxies\nin three more intermediate redshift clusters and their field. A\nplan of the paper follows. In Sect. 2, we describe our sample and\nthe improvements in our data reduction technique in comparison\nwith Paper III. In Sect. 3, we explain the analysis of the data.\nIn Sect. 4, we discuss our results and compare them with the\nliterature. Sect. 5 summarizes the results and our conclusions.\nThroughout this paper, we assume that the Hubble constant, the matter density and the cosmological constant are\nH0 = 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9m = 0.3 and \u03a9\u03bb = 0.7 respectively\n(Tonry et al. 2003).\n\n2. Sample and data properties\n2.1. Sample\n\nOur sample includes four galaxy clusters which have different\nproperties (Table 1). To be able to compare the galaxies that\nexperience similar environmental conditions, we scale clustercentric distance by each cluster's virial radius. It is known that\neven galaxy clusters at the same redshift can be very different\nfrom one another. Two well-studied rich clusters in the local universe, Coma and Virgo are a good example for that. While Coma\nis dynamically relaxed and spiral poor, Virgo on the contrary is\nunrelaxed and spiral rich (Poggianti 2006).\nHere we give some information about each cluster in our\nsample: MS 0451 is a massive cluster with very high X-ray luminosity. 28% of its spiral population are passive (Moran et al.\n2007a); MS 1008 is a very regular and rich cluster (Lewis et al.\n\nDuring the target selection, we gave priority to galaxies from\nour previous studies, both in field and cluster environments, that\nhave detectable emission lines for extracting velocities. Further\nobjects were drawn from a catalog provided by the CNOC survey (Ellingson et al. 1998) with either redshift information or\nmeasured (g-r) color that matches expectations for spiral templates at z \u2248 0.5. If there was an unused slitlet in the MXU setup,\nand no suitable candidate was available, a galaxy was picked at\nrandom. For our analysis, we also use a sample from SINGS as\na local reference for comparison (see Paper III). SINGS galaxies\nare a diverse set of local normal galaxies (Kennicutt et al. 2003).\nDaigle et al. (2006)'s subsample that we use in our analysis consists of galaxies that have star forming regions, so that their H\u03b1\nkinematics could be extracted. We excluded from our analysis\nthe galaxies in this sample that have luminosities that are very\ndifferent from the luminosities of our intermediate redshift sample, so that the two samples have comparable stellar masses. In\nFig. 1, we compare the H\u03b1 luminosities of galaxies in our sample and in the local sample. H\u03b1 luminosities of the galaxies in\nour sample were calculated using the available emission lines in\ntheir spectra as explained in Sect. 3.3. Since the galaxies in our\nsample were selected mainly based on the strength of their emission, several of them have larger H\u03b1 luminosities, and therefore,\nhigher star formation rates than the galaxies of the local sample.\nThis raises the question whether our sample is biased towards\ndisturbed galaxies, since perturbations are expected to trigger\nstar formation and consequently increase the strength of emission lines. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test of these distributions does not indicate a significant difference between the H\u03b1\nluminosities of the two samples (Table 2). However, we check\nour results by repeating the analysis for a subsample that is in\nthe same H\u03b1 luminosity interval as the local sample.\nWe presented the analysis of our MS 0451 sample in Paper\nIII. We give the basic information about the rest of the sample\nin Table 3. The first character of a galaxy name indicates the\nsample (1:MS 0451 ; 2:MS 1008 ; 3:MS 2137 ; 4:Cl 0412).\nThe second character is \"C\" for cluster members and \"F\" for\nfield galaxies. The last part of the name assigns a number to\neach galaxy. We identified galaxies with redshifts between 3\u03c3\nbelow and above the cluster redshifts as cluster members. Only\nfor MS 0451, which was analyzed in Paper III, we used the redshift interval defined by Moran et al. (2007b) using the redshift\ndistribution of over 500 objects. That gives an interval which\n\n\f4\n\nE. Kutdemir et al.: Internal kinematics of spiral galaxies in distant clusters\n\nTable 2.

For Cl 0412, Dressler et al. (1999) determined cluster\nmembership using the redshift distribution of 22 galaxies. The\nredshift interval they define selects the same galaxies as the 3\u03c3\ncriterion to be cluster members.\nIn Sect. B in the Appendix, we give some information about\neach galaxy. In case the galaxy has emission lines, we present:\na\u2013 the HST-ACS image of the galaxy in the F606W (broad V\nband filter);\nb\u2013 rotation curves of different emission lines (and for some\ncases based on the absorption lines) extracted along the central slit without correction for inclination and seeing;\nc\u2013 position angles of kinematic and photometric axes as a function of radius;\nd\u2013 rotation curves extracted along the central slit and the kinematic major axis;\ne\u2013 velocity field obtained using the strongest line in the\nspectrum;\nf\u2013 normalized flux map of the line used for constructing the\nvelocity field;\ng\u2013 velocity map reconstructed using 6 harmonic terms;\nh\u2013 residual of the velocity map and the reconstructed map;\ni\u2013 simple rotation map constructed for position angle and ellipticity fixed to their global values;\nj\u2013 residual of the velocity map and the simple rotation model;\nk\u2013 position angle and flattening as a function of radius;\nl\u2013 k3 /k1 and k5 /k1 (from the analysis where position angle and\nellipticity are fixed to their global values) as a function of\nradius.\n2.2. Spectroscopic data\n\nOur observations were spread across 5 nights in October and\nNovember 2004 for Cl 0412 (seeing 0.\u2032\u2032 57 (FWHM)); 7 nights in\nDecember 2004 and February 2005 for MS 1008 (seeing 0.\u2032\u2032 73);\n5 nights between May and July 2005 for MS 2137 (seeing 0.\u2032\u2032 76).\nEach sample was observed using three masks and the integration\ntime of each mask was split into three exposures. Even in cases\nwhere all three exposures were taken during the same night, the\nframes were not perfectly aligned, therefore, we completed the\nreduction of each frame before combining them.\nThe spectral data reduction was done in the same way as\nexplained in Paper III, apart from using a different sky subtraction method, which improved the results considerably. In Paper\nIII, the sky is modelled in spectra that are interpolated along\nthe X axis for wavelength calibration. Here we use the algorithm described in Kelson (2003) which is based on modelling\nthe sky in the original data frame as a function of the rectified\ncoordinates. Modelling the sky before applying any rectification/rebinning to the data reduces the amount of noise that is\nintroduced to the data during the sky-subtraction process (see\nalso Milvang-Jensen et al. 2008). To quantify the difference, we\n\nreduced one of our spectra using both the old and the new methods. We averaged 15 spatial rows, that are far from the galaxy\nspectrum, and therefore include sky-line residuals only. A third\norder polynomial was fitted to and then subtracted from this distribution across the wavelength axis and the root mean square of\nthe counts was calculated for both spectra. A comparison of the\ntwo shows that the noise is 30% less in case we use the new sky\nsubtraction method.\nTo be able to compare the H\u03b1 emission line fluxes of our\nsample with the local sample, we applied a rough flux calibration to our data. We used the spectrum of a star that we observed\ntogether with our MS 0451 sample for the calibration of all our\ndata, since they were observed with the same instrument. The\nstar that we used is U0825 01208341 in the PMM USNO-A2.0\ncatalogue of Monet et al. (1998). We transformed the B and R\nmagnitudes of the star given in the catalog onto the standard\nJohnson-Cousins system using the conversions provided by\nKidger (2003).\n\n2.3. Photometric data\n\nEnvironmental effects on how a galaxy evolves depend on its\nintrinsic properties. For example it is known that harassment\nis more efficient on low central surface mass density galaxies\n(Moore et al. 1999). In this context, it is important to test\nwhether the abnormalities that we see in gas kinematics of a\ngalaxy correlate with its photometrical properties. To investigate\nthis issue, we use both VLT/FORS2 and HST/ACS images.\nWe obtained imaging of the MS 1008, MS 2137 and Cl 0412\nsamples in the ACS/F606W filter while we exploited existing\nimaging of MS 0451 in the ACS/F814W filter from the ST\u2212ECF\nHST archive. Ground based images were taken in the B, V,\nR and I filters for the whole sample. The FORS2 filters B, V\nand I are close approximations to the Johnson-Cousins (Bessell\n1990) photometric system while the R filter is a special filter for\nFORS2 that is similar to the Cousins R 1 .\n\n3. Analysis\n3.1. Photometry\n\nSurface photometry analysis, magnitude measurements, extinction and k-correction were done in the same manner as explained\nin Paper III. We have not applied an internal dust (inclination)\ncorrection. Galactic extinction and k-corrected MB magnitudes,\nrest-frame B \u2212 V, V \u2212 R and R \u2212 I colors of the galaxies in our\nsample are given in Table C.1 in the Appendix. k-correction was\ndone using the kcorrect algorithm by Blanton & Roweis (2007).\nAbraham et al. (1994) defined concentration and asymmetry\nparameters to be able to do the morphological classification of\ngalaxies in a quantitative and automated way. The first parameter\nquantifies how concentrated the light distribution of an object is,\nand it is larger for earlier type galaxies. The second parameter\nmeasures how asymmetric the light distribution of a galaxy is\nand becomes larger for later type galaxies. We use slightly different definitions for asymmetry and concentration parameters\nthan in Paper III. Here we give the new definitions that are based\non Abraham et al. (1996) and Conselice et al. (2000). The concentration is the ratio of the flux within G1 , the area inside the\n1\nThe\nFORS2\nfilter\ncurves\nare\ngiven\nhttp://www.eso.org/instruments/fors/inst/Filters/curves.html\n\nat\n\n\fE.

The Gini coefficient quantifies the nonuniformity in the light distribution and strongly correlates with\nthe concentration index for local galaxies. Since the Gini coefficient has no dependence on the definition of the center of an object (Eq. 3), it is often used as an alternative to the concentration\nparameter in studies of high-redshift galaxies, a large fraction of\nwhich are peculiar.\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6X\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7 n\n1\n\uf8f7\uf8f8 (2i \u2212 n \u2212 1)| fi |,\n(3)\nG = \uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n| f |n(n \u2212 1) i=1\nwhere | fi | are the absolute flux values of a galaxy's constitutent\npixels sorted in increasing order, | f | is their mean value and n is\nthe number of pixels.\nThe M20 index is based on the total second-order moment\nMT OT , which is the flux in each pixel fi multiplied by its squared\ndistance to the galaxy center, summed over all pixels of the\ngalaxy (Eq. 4).\nMT OT =\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\nMi =\n\nn\nX\ni\n\nfi ((xi \u2212 xc )2 + (yi \u2212 yc )2 ) *\n\n(4)\n\nFig. 3.

We applied a K-S test to the asymmetry, concentration, Gini and M20\ndistributions of the local versus distant field samples as well as\nthe distant cluster versus field samples. Only the galaxies for\nwhich we have spectroscopic redshifts (see Table 3 here and\nTable 1 in Paper III) and that were classified as late types (spiral\nor irregular) according to our eye-ball classification (Table 3 and\nTable 4) were used in this analysis. Galaxy 2F19 was also excluded since it is not distant (z = 0.0052). The results are given in\nTable 6 and the distributions are shown in Fig.2. The distant cluster and field samples have significantly different distributions for\nthe concentration, Gini and M20 parameters. For the asymmetry,\nthe difference between the two samples is considerable, but not\nvery significant. The distributions of the local and distant field\nsamples are significantly different for the M20 and concentration\nparameters. The difference is large for the Gini coefficient while\nthe significance level of the statistic is not very high. The asymmetry distributions are similar for the two samples.\nThe rest-frame wavelength of the ACS images of our sample corresponds to the B band, therefore we used blue KPNO,\nCTIO, Palomar and Isaac Newton images of the SINGS galaxies for the measurements. These images were convolved with a\npoint spread function and then rebinned to have the same seeing and pixel size in kpc as the HST images of our sample at\nthe mean redshift of our clusters (z = 0.4). The asymmetry and\nconcentration parameters can be used for morphological classification. We present our galaxies and local galaxies from SINGS\non the A \u2212 C plane together with our eye-ball classification of\ntheir morphologies in Fig. 3. Selection limits which separate\ndifferent morphological types on the plane, as determined by\nMenanteau et al. (2006), are shown on top of this plot. The borders are then adjusted by minimizing the amount of contamination from different types in each region.\n3.2. Kinematics\n\nWe analyze the gas kinematics of our whole sample in the\nway that was described in Paper III, using a sample from SINGS\nas a local reference for comparison (see Paper III).

In this analysis, only the galaxies for\nwhich spectroscopic redshifts are available (see Table 3 here and Table 1\nin Paper III) and that are late morphological types (spiral/irregular) according to our eye-ball classification (see Table 3 and Table 4) were\nused. Galaxy 2F19 was also excluded since it is not distant (z = 0.0052).\n\nthe introduction section, we look for indications of disturbance\nin velocity fields to be able to examine environmental effects.\nThere are three parameters that we use for quantifying these abnormalities:\na\u2013 the standard deviation of the kinematic position angle (\u03c3PA );\nb\u2013 the average misalignment between the photometric and kinematic axes (\u2206\u03c6);\nc\u2013 the mean deviation of the velocity field from a simple rotating disk (k3,5 /k1 ).\nThe line of sight (LOS) velocity profile of a simple rotating disk is a cosine function (Krajnovi\u0107 et al. 2006). Our last\n(ir)regularity parameter measures the deviation from the cosine\nform that can be represented with the third and the fifth order\nterms of the Fourier series. The exact definition of each of the\n(ir)regularity parameters is given in Paper III. Their values for\neach galaxy are listed in Table 7. Examination of the data shows\nthat in some special cases these measurements have to be excluded from the analysis (explained in Sect. 3.8).\n3.3. Star Formation Rates\n\nHere we analyze the star formation properties of the galaxies in\nour sample. We use the total fluxes of available emission lines\nin the spectra to measure the star formation rates (SFR). The luminosities are calculated using these fluxes and corrected for extinction following Tully & Fouqu\u00e9 (1985). The inclinations are\nmeasured from our HST/ACS imaging (Table C.2). For a comparison between different extinction corrections, we have applied the definitions of Giovanelli et al. (1994) and Tully et al.\n(1998), which makes a factor of 10% difference at most in\nSFRs. Tully & Fouqu\u00e9 (1985) better matches the extinction law\n(Cardelli et al. 1989) for reasonable values of E(B-V). Star formation rates that rely on [OII]3727 or H\u03b1 line were calculated\napplying Kennicutt (1992) and for H\u03b2 , case B recombination\nwas assumed, which implies a factor 2.86 difference in comparison with H\u03b1 . Note that we have not corrected the H\u03b2 luminosities for underlying stellar absorption. For the calculations\nbased on [OIII]5007 we have followed Maschietto et al. (2008)\nand Teplitz et al. (2000).\n\n\f8\n\nE. Kutdemir et al.: Internal kinematics of spiral galaxies in distant clusters\n\nTable 7.

(2005).\n\nFig. 5. Specific star formation rate versus rest-frame B-V color\nfor our sample and the local sample from SINGS.\n\nIn Fig.4, we plot the SFR versus stellar mass for the galaxies\nin our sample. A comparison with the relations for z \u223c 1 and\nz \u223c 0 galaxies and the SINGS local sample shows that SF properties of the galaxies in our sample cover a wide range and some\ngalaxies have higher star formation rates than the z \u223c 1 relation.\nIt should be noted that this relation has a large intrinsic scatter\nat all redshifts. In Fig.5 we show specific SFR versus rest-frame\nB-V which follows the expected trend.\nSince we calculated the star formation rates using the integrated flux from three adjacent slits that cover a galaxy, aperture\neffects are negligible. On the other hand, we are forced to use\ndifferent emission lines for calculating SFRs due to the differ-\n\n\fE. Kutdemir et al.: Internal kinematics of spiral galaxies in distant clusters\n\nent rest-frame wavelength coverage of the spectra from galaxies\nat different redshifts. The conversions that are used for this purpose are likely to cause some systematic errors (Moustakas et al.\n2006). To check for our sample, how successful it would be to\nuse a constant factor for conversion from one emission line flux\nto the other, we plot the frequency distribution of emission line\nflux ratios in Fig. 6. This exercise shows that the uncertainty\nin H\u03b1 luminosities (Table 8) that is caused by these differences\n(sigma of the distribution) is about a factor 2.\n\n3.4. Frequency Distribution of the Kinematic Irregularities\n\nIn Fig. 7 d, e and f, we show the frequency distribution of each\n(ir)regularity parameter for the field and cluster galaxies in our\nsample. The same information for local galaxies is given above\neach plot for comparison (Fig. 7 a, b and c). Cluster and field\ngalaxies are distributed in a similar manner in the (ir)regularity\nparameters space. Both cluster and field galaxies populate regions inside and outside the area where regular velocity fields\nof local galaxies are located. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S)\ntest of the distributions also confirms that field and cluster populations are not significantly different from one another (see\nTable 9). Here we discuss the origin of the largest parameter values: The two galaxies that have the largest \u03c3PA values are 1F6\nand 4F7. 1F6 has a kinematically decoupled core, therefore, it\nis probably a merger remnant (Paper III, Fig.B.13). 4F7 seems\nto be a merger too. The residual of its velocity field and reconstructed velocity map reveals the existence of a counter-rotating\ncomponent in the outer part (see Fig.B.49.g and j). There are\ntidal structures visible on its HST image as well (Fig.B.49.a).\nThe largest \u2206\u03c6 belongs to 3F7 which has a strong bar (Fig.B.40).\nAlthough the kinematic and the photometric position angles\nmatch quite well in the disk region, the extent of the observed\nvelocity field does not go far outside the bar (see Fig.B.40.a,c,e),\ntherefore, this galaxy has a very large \u2206\u03c6 value. \u2206\u03c6 clearly has\nan important contribution of a bar in case of two other galaxies\nin our sample: 1F6 and 2C3. So a large \u2206\u03c6 either indicates a misalignment between the stellar disk and the kinematic axis of the\ngas, or the presence of a bar.\nIn Sect. 3.1, we determined the morphological type of the\ngalaxies by our eye-ball classification (Table 3 & Table 4). Here\nwe check how the (ir)regularity parameter values of different\nmorphological types are distributed (Fig. 8) and find that irregularities in gas kinematics of spiral and irregular /peculiar galaxies\nare very similar (see Table 10 for the K-S test results).\n\n3.5. Dependence On the Clustercentric Distance\n\nAll cluster members in our sample, except for 4C2, are well inside the virial radius, where both tidal processes and ICM-related\nmechanisms are effective. In Fig. 9, we show the distance of each\ngalaxy from the cluster center in projection (in virial radii) and\nplot that against (ir)regularity parameters. There are quite a few\ngalaxies within half a virial radius from the center, that are below the irregularity threshold of k3,5 /k1 and \u03c3PA . 69 \u00b1 11% of the\ncluster galaxies are regular according to both of these parameters\nwhile most of them have large \u2206\u03c6 values. The fraction of galaxies within 1 Rvir that have regular gas kinematics according to all\nthe three criteria is 13 \u00b1 8%.\n\n9\n\nTable 8.

In case the H\u03b1 line was outside the observed wavelength interval, we converted the fluxes of\navailable emission lines to H\u03b1 flux as explained in Sect. 3.3.\nFor the cluster members, we find significant correlations between the log(LH\u03b1 ) and two indicators of kinematical irregularities: \u03c3PA and k3,5 /k1 (Fig.10, a and b).

However, dust\nextinction can weaken this correlation. For our data, we find\na weak anti-correlation between these two quantities only for\ncluster members (Fig.10, c). The irregularity parameters become\nlarger for bluer galaxies. However the trends are very weak (see\nTable 11).\n3.6.2. Correlations Between (Ir)regularity Parameters\n\nTo be able to use the (ir)regularity parameters as a tool to distinguish disturbed velocity fields from regular ones, it is necessary to determine a threshold value for each of them. We\ndid that by measuring each parameter for local, regular velocity fields from SINGS (see Paper III, Sect. 4). In Fig. A.1 in the\n\nTable 10.

Regularity borders that are defined using the local\ngalaxies are indicated on each plot. We find a weak correlation\nbetween k3,5 /k1 and \u03c3PA (see Table 11) which agrees with what\nwe found in Paper III using only the MS 0451 sample. If we look\nat the galaxies that have large k3,5 /k1 and \u03c3PA parameters, most\nof them show signs of an additional kinematic component in the\nresidual of the simple rotating model and the original velocity\nfield (residual maps are presented in Sect. B, part (j) of each figure). These galaxies are 1F4, 1F6, 4F7 and 4F8. In all cases, the\nexistence of a secondary component is clear in the residual map.\nk5 is sensitive to extra kinematic components and \u03c3PA is sensitive\nto their misalignment with the main component. Therefore, the\noutliers of the k3,5 /k1 versus \u03c3PA plot mostly consist of velocity\nfields that have multiple kinematic components. This explains\nthe weak correlation between these two parameters.\n\n\f12\n\nE. Kutdemir et al.: Internal kinematics of spiral galaxies in distant clusters\n\nTable 11.

Correlations With Photometric Parameters\n\nApart from the Gini coefficient, M20 , photometric asymmetry\nand concentration parameters that are defined in Sect. 3.1, the\nmethods we use for measuring the morphological/photometric\nparameters are explained in Paper III. Photometric and morphological parameters of the galaxies in our sample are given in\n\nTable C.1 and Table C.2 respectively (see Paper III, Table C.2\nfor the morphological parameters of the MS 0451 sample.). The\n(ir)regularity parameters of the local sample galaxies are given in\nPaper III, Table 3. Their photometric parameters are given here,\nin Table 5.\nTo focus on the effects of the interactions that take place\nonly in clusters, we now restrict ourselves to our cluster sample, where most galaxies are within half a virial radius from the\ncluster center. In this region, mergers are rare, while harassment\nand ICM related mechanisms such as ram pressure stripping are\nexpected to be effective (Moore et al. 1997). We give the correlation measurements of the cluster members that are located\nwithin 1Rvir from the cluster center in Table 11. The parameters\nthat correlate with each other are plotted in Fig. 11 and discussed\nin Sect. 4.5.\n3.7.

Now we will look\nat the fraction of galaxies that have irregular gas kinematics.\nFractions that are measured for each irregularity type separately\nand also without distinguishing between the three types are given\nin Table 12. We obtain very similar fractions of irregular gas\nkinematics for cluster and field environments. Each irregularity\nparameter gives a very different fraction compared to the others,\nwhich will be discussed in Sect. 4.3.\n3.8. Special Cases\n\nHere we explain the cases that we exclude from our analysis. For the same information on the MS 0451 sample, see\nPaper III, Sect. 4.1. For face-on galaxies, photometric position angle measurements are very uncertain. Since LOS velocities are very small in such cases, the effect of noise becomes\nmore pronounced in velocity fields. This causes \u2206\u03c6 to be unreliable. Therefore, we excluded such cases from our analysis\n(2F4, 2F11, 2F12, 4C3). Among those, 2F11 is an extreme case\nwhich is completely excluded from the analysis (see Fig.B.29.e).\nThe other galaxies that we did not use in our analysis are 2F5,\n2F15&16. 2F5 does not have any signal in the upper slit, which\naffects the measurements. Looking at the iso-velocity lines on\nthe receding side (Fig.B.23.e), it looks as if the highest positive velocities are located in the top right corner, which is missing on the map. 2F15&16 (see Fig.B.33) are at the same redshift, however it is not clear what kind of objects they are and\nthe emission line they have could not be identified. The velocity field includes information from both, but most of it comes\nfrom 2F15. The [OIII]5007 velocity field of 4F4 (see Fig.B.46.e)\n\nlooks quite disturbed, although the flux map of the same emission line looks rather regular. Emission from this galaxy is very\nstrong and therefore, we can rely on its (ir)regularity parameters.\n\n4. Discussion\n4.1. Frequency Distribution of the Kinematic Irregularities\n\nWe analyze together gas kinematics and stellar photometry of\nspiral galaxies in clusters and in the field. We find that the fraction of galaxies that have irregular gas kinematics is very similar\nin our cluster and field samples. These two samples also give a\nvery similar frequency distribution of each (ir)regularity parameter. When interpreting the results we have to consider that our\nsample selection is based on the emission line flux of galaxies.\nA comparison of our sample with a local sample from SINGS\nshows that some galaxies in both our cluster and field samples\nhave higher H\u03b1 luminosities, and therefore, higher star formation rates (Fig.1). In some of these cases, high star formation\nactivity might be the result of some type of interaction. It has\nto be considered, however, that H\u03b1 luminosity of a galaxy can\nalso increase due to facts that are unrelated to interactions such\nas regular starbursts (Kennicutt 1998).\nIn Fig. 7 (g), (h) and (i) we show how the subsample of\ngalaxies that have H\u03b1 luminosities within the same interval as\nthe SINGS sample is distributed in the (ir)regularity parameters\nspace. The field galaxies that are populating the high irregularity end of the plots are not necessarily the ones with high H\u03b1\nluminosities. So, independent from whether the high star formation galaxies are included or not, the distribution of cluster and\nfield galaxies in irregularity space is very similar. The majority\nof the field galaxies in our sample are more irregular than local\nfield galaxies according to at least one of the three (ir)regularity\ncriteria. This is the case even if we take into account only the\nones that have H\u03b1 luminosities within the same interval as the\nSINGS sample, which are mostly in the interval 0.1 \u2264 z \u2264 0.5.\nThis could be the result of a higher occurence of disk building processes such as mergers and accretion events at these redshifts. Using N-body simulations, Gottl\u00f6ber et al. (2001) investigate the relative major merger rate of the population of cluster,\ngroup and isolated halos as a function of redshift. They find that\nfor cluster galaxies, the relative merger rate increases with redshift while it decreases for isolated galaxies. At z \u223c 0.5, they\nfind the major merger rate in the field to be two times as high as\nthat in clusters (see Gottl\u00f6ber et al. 2001, Fig. 9).\nIn the local universe, evidence has been accumulating,\nmainly from HI studies, on the importance of cold gas accretion:\nA large number of galaxies are accompanied by gas-rich dwarfs\nor are surrounded by HI cloud complexes, tails and filaments\n\n\f14\n\nE.

Most of the high-velocity clouds around the\nMilky Way are now widely accepted to belong to its halo and direct evidence for infall of intergalactic gas (Wakker et al. 2007,\n2008). Recently, accretion of satellites has also been revealed by\nstudies of the distribution and kinematics of stars in the halos\nof the Milky Way and of M31. The discovery of the Sgr Dwarf\ngalaxy (Ibata et al. 1994) is regarded as proof that accretion is\nstill taking place. It is also possible that the warped outer layers, lopsidedness and the extra-planar gas, which are very common features in galaxies, are related to the accretion process.\nObservational results suggest cold gas accretion to be a likely\nformation mechanism for the polar disks (Bravo-Alfaro et al.\n2004; Stanonik et al. 2009). Simulations support this picture\n(Macci\u00f2 et al. 2006).\nThe radial velocity difference and angular separation of some\ngalaxies in our sample suggest that they may be gravitationally\nbound to each other. Since we do not have the spectra of the objects surrounding the galaxies in our sample, we can not make\na definite statement of whether they are group members or not.\nThe number statistics in Huchra & Geller (1982) show that velocity dispersions up to 400 kms\u22121 and sizes up to 2 Mpc are\nlikely (with median values of 155 kms\u22121 and 0.7 Mpc) for galaxy\ngroups. For galaxy pairs, it is expected that at least 35 percent of\nthe ones with projected separation of less than 20 h\u22121 kpc and\nvelocity difference of less than 500 kms\u22121 are physically bound\n(De Propris et al. 2007). On the other hand there are several interacting pairs with a projected separation of around 50 h\u22121 kpc\n(Barton et al. 1999; Patton et al. 2000). Lambas et al. (2003) find\nthat star formation in galaxy pairs is significantly enhanced over\nthat of isolated galaxies with similar redshifts in the field for projected separations less than 25 h\u22121 kpc and velocity differences\nof less than 100 kms\u22121 .\nBased on this information, the galaxies in our sample that\nmight be gravitationally interacting with each other are listed\nin Table 13. The average values of each irregularity parameter\nfor these galaxies (excluding the unreliable values that are mentioned in Paper III for the MS 0451 sample and here, in Sect. 3.8\nfor the rest) are k3,5 /k1 = 0.15, \u03c3PA = 13 and \u2206\u03c6 = 23. Among\nthese galaxies, 4F7 has a very large \u03c3PA and 4F12 has a very\nhigh k3,5 /k1 . Excluding the galaxies in Table 13 from the comparison between the irregularity distributions of the cluster and\nfield galaxies (see Sect. 3.4) does not change the results (see\nTable 14).\n4.2. Frequency Distribution of the Morphological Parameters\n\nIn Sect. 3.1 we compare the distributions of some morphological parameters: asymmetry, concentration, M20 and Gini coefficient for distant cluster versus field samples as well as for local\nversus distant field samples (see Fig.2 and Table 6). We find a\nsignificant difference between the distribution of the concentration, the Gini coefficient and the M20 parameter for the cluster\n\nTable 14.

The Fraction of Irregular Gas Kinematics\n\nIn Y08, the [OII] doublet velocity fields of 63 field galaxies, that\nare at z = 0.4 \u2212 0.75 and that have M stellar \u2265 1.5 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 ,\nare analyzed. They classify galaxy kinematics based on an eyeinspection of the gas velocity map, gas velocity dispersion map\nand high resolution image together. Their study of velocity fields\nhowever is limited to 2\u2032\u2032 \u00d73\u2032\u2032 field of view while it can be as large\nas \u223c 3\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 6\u2032\u2032 in our case. They call a galaxy \"rotating disk\" if\nits velocity field has an ordered gradient, the photometric and\nthe kinematic major axes are aligned and the velocity dispersion map has a single peak close to the kinematic center. If the\nvelocity dispersion map has no peak or has a peak that is offset\nfrom the center while the other criteria are satisfied, they classify\nthe case as \"perturbed rotation\". If both the velocity dispersion\nmap and the velocity map deviate from the regular case, they\nclassify it as \"complex kinematics\". Deviation from the regular\ncase for a velocity field corresponds here to an irregular velocity gradient and/or a misalignment between the photometric and\nkinematic axes. Therefore, when the three indications we use are\nat the level of being detectable by eye within the central part of\na galaxy, its kinematics can be classified as complex according\nto this scheme. Even then they find that 26% of their sample\nhave velocity fields and velocity dispersion maps that are both\nincompatible with disk rotation. When we calculate the irregularity fractions of the field galaxies in our sample that are within\nthe same redshift interval as their sample, we find 10 \u00b1 9% (according to \u03c3PA ), 60 \u00b1 15% (\u2206\u03c6), 30 \u00b1 14% (k3,5 /k1 ). Their result\nis very close to what we find using the k3,5 /k1 criterion. However\nit should be noted that most of the galaxies in our sample are less\nmassive (see Table C.1, Column 8).\nIt is known from the local Universe that most galaxies in\nthe central parts of galaxy clusters lack gas. To be able to study\nvelocity fields of galaxies, priority was given to emission line\n\n\fE. Kutdemir et al.: Internal kinematics of spiral galaxies in distant clusters\n\n15\n\nFig. 11. (Ir)regularity parameters versus some photometric quantities. For each plot, the line shows the correlation between the given\nparameters. The local galaxies are not used in correlation measurements, but shown as a reference in each plot. The names that are\nwritten in red and italic belong to the galaxies that are excluded from the correlation as explained in Paper III for the MS 0451\nsample and here, in Sect. 3.8 for the rest. a: M20 index versus the mean misalignment between the photometric and kinematic\nmajor axes (\u2206\u03c6) (correlation coefficient=0.5). The thick green line shows the correlation obtained excluding the cases where the\n\u2206\u03c6 value mainly indicates a clumpy light distribution or a bar instead of an abnormality in the position of the kinematic axis. The\ngalaxies for which this is the case are indicated with # symbol next to them. Measuring the correlation after excluding these galaxies\ngives the same result. b: The disk scale length (Rd ) versus the standard deviation of the kinematic position angle (\u03c3PA ) (correlation\ncoefficient=0.5).

Therefore, most cluster galaxies in our sample are perhaps just infalling and have not been\nseverely affected by the cluster environment yet. This would explain the similarity between the gas kinematics of cluster and\nfield galaxies in our sample.\nWe use k3,5 /k1 , \u03c3PA and \u2206\u03c6 to trace the effects of the interaction processes on gas kinematics. We find that the irregularity\nfractions measured using each of these parameters are very different from one another: \u03c3PA gives a value around 10%, k3,5 /k1\n\u223c 30% and \u2206\u03c6 \u223c 70% for both cluster and field galaxies. This\nmay have a number of different reasons. One is the effect of\nlower spatial resolution for intermediate redshift galaxies. Our\nsimulations in Paper III, Appendix A, indicate that small scale\nirregularities may be smeared out as a result of the resolution effects. A misalignment between the stellar disk and the rotation\nplane of the gas on the other hand is unlikely to be affected much\nby low resolution. One should also realize that not all galaxies with high \u2206\u03c6 are irregular. For example, galaxies with bars\ncan have larger \u2206\u03c6 values. Also, some galaxies in the local universe are found showing regular kinematics with an HI polar disk\n(perpendicular to the stellar disk) (van Gorkom & Schiminovich\n1997; Stanonik et al. 2009). Petrosian et al. (2002) observed 18\nblue compact dwarf galaxies and for 8 of these they found strong\nmisalignments between the photometric and kinematic position\nangles although the isovelocity contours do not indicate strong\nirregularities in gas motions. There are even merger remnants in\nthe local universe that have very regular gas velocity fields such\nas NGC 3921 (Hibbard & van Gorkom 1996).\n4.4. Correlations With the H\u03b1 Luminosity\n\nLarger irregularities (k3,5 /k1 and \u03c3PA ) we find for higher\nlog(LH\u03b1 ) probably show that galaxies which have more irregular\ngas kinematics have higher star formation rates. These correlations are valid only for cluster members (see Fig.10). According\nto models, most interaction processes in clusters increase star\nformation activity at the beginning, before they eventually suppress it. Gravitational interactions are expected first to trigger nuclear gas infall. Models by Fujita (1998) show that in-\n\ncreased star formation activity is expected in case of harassment, since high-speed encounters between galaxies cause gas\nto accumulate to centers of galaxies. Ram-pressure stripping,\nwhich is the hydrodynamic interaction between the hot ICM\nand the cold ISM, leads to an increase of the external pressure, shock formation, thermal instabilities and turbulent motions within the disk. Evrard (1991) and Bekki & Couch (2003),\nfor example, show that all these events increase cloud-cloud collisions and cloud collapse, and therefore, enhance star formation activity. However, in case of ram-pressure stripping, there\nare not many observations supporting this picture. Some examples in A1367 that experience ram-pressure stripping are CGCG\n97-023, where enhanced star formation activity per unit mass,\ncompared to galaxies of similar type and luminosity is confirmed (Gavazzi et al. 1995), CGCG 97-073 and CGCG 97079 (Boselli & Gavazzi 2006). Models of Fujita (1998) and\nFujita & Nagashima (1999) that quantify the variations of the\nstar formation activity, show that on short timescales (\u223c 108 yr)\nin high-density, rich clusters, the star formation activity can increase by up to a factor of 2 at most. But on longer timescales,\nremoval of the HI gas leads to a decrease of the fuel feeding\nthe star formation, and galaxies become quiescent (Fujita 1998;\nFujita & Nagashima 1999; Okamoto & Nagashima 2001).\n\n4.5. Correlations With Photometric Parameters\n\nWe find a weak correlation between M20 and \u2206\u03c6 for cluster\nmembers (Fig. 11a). M20 becomes very large in case the galaxy\nlight has a clumpy distribution. Since clumpiness is mainly\ncaused by star forming regions, it means that galaxies that have\nirregular gas kinematics have more star formation. M20 also increases towards later types. Since galaxies that have high mass\nconcentration (earlier types) are more resistant to tidal mechanisms, the correlation we find is expected as a result of this fact\nas well. The concentration parameter on the other hand, which\nis another indicator of galaxy type, does not give any correlation\nwith the irregularity in gas kinematics. Therefore, the substructures must be the main cause of the correlation that we find.\n\n\f16\n\nE. Kutdemir et al.: Internal kinematics of spiral galaxies in distant clusters\n\nWe need to note that \u2206\u03c6 cannot be considered as a pure indicator of interactions since it is sensitive to bars that are misaligned with the disk. Even though the formation of a bar can\nbe triggered by environmentally induced gravitational instabilities, such as tidal interactions between galaxies and the cluster potential well, it can also just be the result of a misalignment between the disk and the triaxial halo of the galaxy itself\n(Kodama & Smail 2001; Bekki & Freeman 2002). Since a bar\nis not necessarily formed by an interaction process, we remeasured the correlation of \u2206\u03c6 with the other parameters excluding\nthe cases where we see that a bar has an important contribution\nto the \u2206\u03c6 value (3F7, 1F6 and 2C3). The results remained the\nsame.\nWe find a correlation between the disk scale length and \u03c3PA\n(Fig. 11b). However, what we see on the plot is an increasing\ndeviation of \u03c3PA values with increasing Rd rather than a correlation. While small galaxies are all regular, there are both regular and irregular cases among larger galaxies. It is known that\nsome interaction processes are more effective on larger galaxies\nsuch as interactions between galaxies and the cluster potential\nwell, viscous stripping and thermal evaporation. Tidal interactions between galaxies, on the other hand, are more efficient on\nsmaller galaxies (Byrd & Valtonen 1990). What we see in our\ndata might be an indication of the activity of some of the first\ngroup processes in the central 1Rvir of the clusters in our sample.\nWe find that MB and \u03c3PA anti-correlate with each other\n(Fig. 11c) showing that more massive galaxies have more irregular gas kinematics. Since larger galaxies are also more massive\n(Trujillo et al. 2004), the interpretation of this correlation is the\nsame as the correlation that we find for the disk scale length.\nOne or a combination of the following mechanisms might be effective on the cluster members in our sample: viscous stripping,\nthermal evaporation and tidal interactions between galaxies and\nthe cluster potential well.\nWe investigated whether morphological peculiarities correlate with irregularities in the gas kinematics. Among the galaxies\nthat have irregular/peculiar morphology according to our eyeball classification (see Table 3 and Table 4), there is no trend towards larger kinematical irregularities (see Fig. 8). We find very\nsimilar distributions of the irregularity parameters for spirals and\nirregular/peculiar galaxies (Table 10). We also do not find a correlation between the photometric asymmetry and irregularities in\nthe gas kinematics. Neichel et al. (2008) on the other hand find\na good agreement between their morphological and kinematical\nclassifications.\nFor the correlations that we find for cluster galaxies, where\nthe \u03c3PA parameter is involved, it should be considered that there\nare only two galaxies that are slightly above the irregularity\nthreshold of \u03c3PA (Fig.11b&c). Therefore, although we discuss\nthe possibility of these correlations being a result of cluster specific interaction mechanisms, this is not a strong result.\n4.6. Comparison With High Redshift Studies\n\nS08 uses a method that is based on kinemetry to distinguish\nmerging and non-merging systems. They quantify the asymmetries in both the velocity field and the velocity dispersion map\nof ionized gas. Using the measurements of these two parameters\nfor template galaxies, they determine where merging and nonmerging systems are located on the plane of these parameters\nversus each other and define\na criterion to distinguish them from\nq\n\n2\none another: Kasym = Vasym\n+ \u03c32asym = 0.5. We measured the\nVasym parameter of our velocity fields (Table 7) and compared\n\nFig. 12. Number distribution of the Vasym parameter that is described in S08. a: Galaxies and the templates in S08 that are classified as disk and merger. b: The galaxies in our sample that are\nclassified as regular or irregular depending on their k3,5 /k1 values. The galaxies that have doubtful k3,5 /k1 values as explained\nin Paper III for the MS 0451 sample and here, in Sect. 3.8 for the\nrest are excluded from this histogram. c: z \u223c 2 SINS galaxies in\nS08 that are classified as disk and merger.\nthese with the Vasym of the merging and non-merging galaxies\nand models in S08 (see Fig. 12). The quality of our sigma-maps\nis not satisfactory for an analysis. However, the possibility that\n\u03c3asym and Vasym give contradictory results is very low (see Fig. 5\nin S08). Therefore, we use Vasym alone with the purpose of making a comparison between the methods. To measure a global ellipticity and a global inclination, which are used while measuring the Vasym parameter, we calculate the median of their values\noutside half the full width at half maximum of the seeing.\nIf we look at the Vasym distribution of our galaxies, we\nsee that most of them are located in the region of the nonmerging galaxies, as defined by S08 (Fig. 12a, b). Vasym is similar to k3,5 /k1 and a comparison between these parameters for our\ngalaxies shows that they correlate with each other (Fig. 13, correlation coefficient=0.86). On the other hand, the classification\nthresholds are quite different for the two criteria. Following S08,\n\n\fE. Kutdemir et al.: Internal kinematics of spiral galaxies in distant clusters\n\nFig. 13. Vasym parameter that is described in S08 versus k3,5 /k1 .\nData points that are far out of the general distribution are shown\nseparately, on top of the main plot. # sign indicates the galaxies\nfor which, both parameters are unreliable (see Sect. 3.8). These\ngalaxies are not used in the correlation measurement.\n\nmost of our objects would be regular while many more galaxies are classified as irregular with our method. This is visible\nin Fig. 12 where the Vasym distribution of our galaxies is given\ntogether with non-mergers and mergers in S08. Classification\nof these galaxies according to the k3,5 /k1 criterion is indicated\non the same plot. While the method of S08 aims at separating\nmergers from non-mergers, it would not fulfill our requirement\nof tracing the imprints of environmental processes. 4F7 (in the\nnon-merger region with Vasym =0.17) is a good example to explain that since the deviation of the position angle, the residual\nmap of the velocity field and the simple rotating disk model and\nalso the galaxy image itself provide signs of a merger.\nWe find that the z \u223c 2 galaxies in S08 are more irregular than\nour complete sample that includes both cluster and field galaxies\nin 0.10 \u2264 z \u2264 0.91 (see Fig. 12b and c). The K-S test results show\nthat the maximum deviation between these two distributions is\n59% and the probability that the samples are similar is 0.002.\n\n5. Summary and conclusions\nUsing gas velocity fields, we trace the activity of interaction\nprocesses both in galaxy clusters and in the field. To measure\nthe irregularities in velocity fields, we use three different indicators: the standard deviation of the kinematic position angle\n(\u03c3PA ), the mean deviation of the LOS velocity profile from a cosine function which is measured using high order Fourier terms\n(k3,5 /k1 ) and the average misalignment between the kinematical\nand photometric major axes (\u2206\u03c6). A regularity threshold for each\nof these parameters is defined using local field galaxies from\nSINGS. 16 cluster members (z \u223c 0.3 and z \u223c 0.5) and 29 field\ngalaxies (at 0.10 \u2264z\u2264 0.91) are then analyzed and studied with\nrespect to the local galaxies in the field and compared with each\nother to evaluate the effect of interaction processes on gas kinematics.\n\n17\n\nOur analysis shows that distant field galaxies have more\nirregular gas kinematics than their local counterparts. This\nsuggests a higher frequency of disk-building processes such\nas accretion events and mergers in the distant universe.\nMorphological properties of these galaxies lead us to the same\nconclusion. The concentration, the Gini coefficient and the M20\nindex measurements indicate that distant field galaxies are more\nclumpy and less centrally concentrated than local field galaxies.\nWe make a comparison between gas kinematics of our intermediate redshift sample and the z \u223c 2 sample of S08 using the\nVasym parameter, which is defined in S08 to distinguish merging\nand non merging systems. We find that our sample, that includes\nboth field and cluster galaxies within 0.10 \u2264 z \u2264 0.91, have more\nregular gas kinematics than the z \u223c 2 galaxies.\nY08 shows that a large fraction of spiral galaxies with\nM stellar \u2265 1.5 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 at z = 0.4 \u2212 0.75 have irregular gas kinematics. When they exclude these galaxies with irregular kinematics, they find no evolution in the scatter and the slope of the\nK-band TFR (Puech et al. 2008). Our analysis shows that a large\nfraction of less massive distant spirals at a median redshift of\nz = 0.36 also have irregular gas kinematics.\nWe find that cluster and field galaxies are distributed in a\nsimilar manner in the (ir)regularity parameters space. We also\nmeasure the fraction of irregular velocity fields. For each parameter, we find remarkably similar fractions for cluster members and field galaxies. This shows that the cluster galaxies in\nour sample are not severely affected by the cluster environment.\nGalaxies in the central parts of clusters are expected to have an\nimporant fraction of their gas stripped via interaction processes\nand it is difficult to obtain velocity fields of these galaxies, especially at high redshifts. Therefore, it is probable that some cluster galaxies in our sample, for which the velocity fields could be\nanalyzed, are just infalling. If this is the case, that explains the\nsimilarity we find between the gas kinematics of cluster and field\ngalaxies. On the other hand, a comparison between the morphological properties of the cluster and field galaxies in our sample reveals a clear difference between them: the cluster sample\nlacks galaxies with low concentration index. This might be due\nto the activity of interaction processes such as harassment which\ncauses matter to migrate towards the center. We compare the gas\nkinematics of spiral and irregular galaxies as well and find no\nsignificant difference between these morphological classes.\nWe find that galaxies with higher H\u03b1 luminosities have\nlarger k3,5 /k1 and \u03c3PA values. In addition to that, galaxies with\nmore substructures have larger average misalignment between\ntheir kinematic and photometric axes (\u2206\u03c6). Since substructures\nmostly are star forming regions, all these correlations mean that\ngalaxies which have more irregular gas kinematics have high star\nformation rates. This is consistent with the theory since most interaction mechanisms in clusters increase star formation activity\nat the beginning, before they eventually supress it.\nAcknowledgements.

They are not\nused in correlation measurements. The galaxies that are excluded from the correlation as explained in Sect. 3.8 are indicated with\ntheir names on the plot. a: standard deviation of the kinematic position angle (\u03c3PA ) versus mean k3,5 /k1 . The correlation we find\nbetween the two for our cluster+field sample (correlation coefficient=0.5) is indicated on the plot.

The parameters of 2F14 are unreliable since there is a diffraction\nspike on top of it. The HST image of 3F7 is incomplete and therefore, its parameters are also unreliable. The disk scale length of these galaxies\nis not used in the analysis. 3F13 could not be analyzed because of the diffraction spike on the image. Col.
