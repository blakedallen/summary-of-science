If the chemical reaction is specified to take place on\na given time interval, then the most likely path taken by the system is a minimizer\nof the Onsager-Machlup functional [3, 4]. In [5] numerical computations are presented which study minimizers of this functional for a variety of model problems in\nlow dimension, together with some higher dimensional problems from physics and\nchemistry such as vacancy diffusion and the Lennard-Jones cluster of 38 atoms.\nThe minimizers exhibit a number of interesting effects, including multiple pathways between configurations, together with transition paths which concentrate at\nsaddle points of the potential, and not at minima. The computations in [5] were performed at low temperature over fixed long intervals. This paper is concerned with\ndetermining the \u0393\u2212limit (see [6, 7]) of the Onsager-Machlup functional in the case\nwhere the temperature is small and the transition time scales as the inverse temperature. Minimizers of the Onsager-Machlup functional have received considerable\nattention in the chemistry literature (see [8] and [5] and the references therein).\nOne of the motivations for the work in [5] is to show that there are certain artefacts\nin this minimization procedure which could be construed as unphysical. In this\npaper we provide a mathematical theory to explain the computational observations\nin [5]. The \u0393\u2212limit which we exhibit may also be of independent interest. The\n\u0393\u2212limit can be optimized via knowledge of the critical points of the potential, the\ntrace of the Hessian of the potential at the critical points, and certain heteroclinic\norbits connecting them. Notably these heteroclinic orbits are in a Hamiltonian system; heteroclinic orbits in the forward or backward gradient flow found from our\nmodel at zero temperature are solutions of this Hamiltonian problem but not necessarily vice versa. Regarding the role of the Hessian in the \u0393\u2212limit, it is pertinent\nto mention the paper [9] in which second derivative of the potential plays a role in\na large deviations principle for SDEs.\nIn section 2 we provide a precise mathematical description of the conditioned\nSDE which forms our mathematical model. We provide an informal derivation of\nthe Onsager-Machlup functional whose minimizers determine most likely transition paths and we explain the sense in which this informal argument can be made\nrigorous. In section 3 we compute the \u0393\u2212limit of the Onsager-Machlup functional\nbuilding on related analyses in [10, 11]. The paper concludes, in section 4, with\nan informal characteriztion of the \u0393\u2212limit, together with numerical experiments\nwhich illustrate this characterization.\n\n2\n\nSet-Up\n\nConsider the following conditioned SDE for x \u2208 C([0, T ]; RN ) making a transition between two states x\u2212 and x+ in time T :\n\u221a\ndx = \u2212DV (x)dt + 2\u03b5 dW,\n(2.1)\nx(0) = x\u2212 and x(T ) = x+ .\nHere V : RN \u2192 R is the potential, W is a standard Brownian motion in RN\nand \u03b5 \u001c 1. In many applications in physics/chemistry N = nd, d \u2208 {1, 2, 3}\nbeing the physical dimension and n the number of particles. Then \u03b5 is the (nondimensional) temperature and x \u2208 C([0, T ]; RN ) denotes the configurational path\n2\n\n\fof the n atoms making a transition between x\u00b1 . Throughout we assume that x\u00b1\nare chosen as critical points of V . We will be particularly interested in choosing\nthese critical points to be minima, so that the problem (2.1) describes a chemical\nreaction; but, in the numerical computations, we will also choose saddle points in\norder to illustrate certain mathematical phenomena.\nEscape from local minima occurs on timescales which are exponentially long\nin \u03b5\u22121 , whilst transitions themselves occur on scales which are logarithmic in \u03b5\u22121 .\nWe focus interest on an intermediate timescale between these two regimes, which\nis \u03b5\u22121 . This timescale is hence long enough to capture a single transition, but not\nlong enough to capture the typical waiting time in a potential minimum. In particular, transition paths calculated in this scaling which pass through an intermediate\nminimum x0 of V will not necessarily exhibit the \"typical\" behaviour that would\nbe exhibited if the time to make the transition from x\u2212 to x+ via x0 were left free.\nThe behaviour of the most likely single transitions in this regime is captured by\nminimizers of the Freidlin-Wentzell action [12, 13]. Numerical methods to capture\nmultiple such transitions are the subject of active study, and the reader should consult [14], and the references therein, for details. From an applied perspective, our\nwork serves to highlight the potential pitfalls of using the Onsager Machlup approach to compute transition paths, and this point is discussed in detail in [5]. As\nmentioned above, the work in this paper gives a mathematical explanation for the\nnumerical results observed in [5]. The results may also be of independent interest\nfrom the point of view of the calculus of variations. In particular the results show\nhow hetereoclinic orbits in a certain Hamiltonian flow form the building block for\nconstruction of the \u0393\u2212limit. This fact may also be of interest in applications where\nattention has focussed on heteroclinic orbits in the forward or backward gradient\nflow found from (2.1) with \u000f = 0; these form particular instances of heteroclinic\norbits in the Hamiltonian flow, but non-gradient connections are also possible, as\nwe will demonstrate.\nTo enforce the scaling of interest we choose T = \u03b5\u22121 and rescale time as\nt = \u03b5\u22121 s, to obtain\n\u221a\n1\ndx = \u2212 DV (x)ds + 2 dW,\n\u03b5\nx(0) = x\u2212 and x(1) = x+ .\n\n(2.2)\n\nIn this scaling we are studying transitions on a unit time-interval, in which the\nsystematic motion of the molecules is large and the thermal noise is of order 1.\nThe probability measure \u03c0 governing the stochastic boundary value problem\n(2.2) has density with respect to the Brownian bridge measure \u03c00 arising in the\ncase V \u2261 0. The density relating the two measures is found from the Girsanov\nformula, together with an integration by parts (use of It\u00f4 formula) and use of the\nboundary conditions on the path [15, 16], and is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ 1\nd\u03c0\n1\n(x) \u221d exp \u2212 2\nG(x; \u03b5)dt\n(2.3)\nd\u03c00\n2\u03b5 0\nwhere the path potential G is (with | * | denoting the Euclidean norm)\n1\nG(x; \u03b5) = |DV (x)|2 \u2212 \u03b5\u2206V (x).\n2\n3\n\n(2.4)\n\n\fFunctions are infinite dimensional and there is no Lebesgue measure in infinite\ndimensions. Nonetheless, it is instructive to think heuristically of the Brownian\nbridge obtained from (2.2) with V \u2261 0 as having a probability density (with respect\nto Lebesgue measure) of the form [17]\n!\nZ\n1 1 dx 2\nexp \u2212\nds .\n(2.5)\n4 0 ds\n(This is the formal limit obtained from the\u0001probability density function for a dis-\u0001\n1 (0, 1) denote the subset of H 1 (0, 1); RN\ncretized Brownian bridge). Let H\u00b1\ncomprised of functions satisfying x(0) = x\u2212 and x(1) = x+ . Then, combining\n(2.3) and (2.5), we\u0001 may think of the probability density for \u03c0 as being proportional\n\u0001\n1\n1 (0, 1) \u2192 R\nto exp \u2212 2\u03b5\nI\u03b5 (x) where the Onsager-Machlup functional I\u03b5 : H\u00b1\nis defined by\nZ 1\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03b5 dx 2 1\nI\u03b5 (x) :=\n(2.6)\n+ G(x; \u03b5) ds.\n2 ds\n\u03b5\n0\nThis intuitive definition of I\u03b5 (x), via the logarithm of the pathspace probability\ndensity function, suggests that minimizers of I\u03b5 are related to paths of maximal\nproability. This can be formulated precisely as follows [3,\u0001 4]. Let B \u03b4 (z) denote a\nN\n1\nball of radius\n\u0001 \u03b4 in C([0, 1]; R ) centred on z \u2208 H\u00b1 (0, 1) . Then, for any z1 , z2 \u2208\n1\nH\u00b1 (0, 1) ,\n\u0001\n\u00101\n\u0001\u0011\n\u03c0 B \u03b4 (z1 )\n\u0001 = exp\nlim\n.\nI\n(z\n)\n\u2212\nI\n(z\n)\n\u03b5\n2\n\u03b5\n1\n\u03b4\u21920 \u03c0 B \u03b4 (z2 )\n2\u000f\nThus, for small ball radius \u03b4, the logarithm of the ratio of the probabilities of the\ntwo balls is equal to the difference in I\u03b5 evaluated at the ball centres. For this\nreason we are interested in minimizers of I\u03b5 .\nThe following notation will be useful. We define\nZ 1\u0010\n\u0011\n1\n\u03b5 dx 2\n+ |DV (x)|2 ds,\nJ\u03b5 (x) =\n2 ds\n2\u03b5\n0\nZ \u221e\u0010\n2\n\u0011\n1 dx\n1\nJ(x) =\n+ |DV (x)|2 ds.\n2\n\u2212\u221e 2 ds\nThen\nZ\nI\u03b5 (x) = J\u03b5 (x) \u2212\n\n(2.7)\n\n1\n\n\u0001\n\u2206V x(s) ds.\n\n(2.8)\n\n0\n\nOur goal in what follows is to demonstrate that the \u0393\u2212limit of I\u03b5 is finite only\nwhen evaluated on the set of BV functions supported on the critical points of V .\nAnd, furthermore, that on this set the value of the \u0393\u2212limit is determined by (suitably rescaled) minima of J, subject to end-point conditions, together with the integral of \u2206V (x). Thus we conclude this section with some observations concerning\nminima of J.\n4\n\n\fThe Euler-Lagrange equations for the functional J are\nd2 x\n\u2212 D2 V (x)DV (x) = 0,\nds2\n\n(2.9)\n\nwhere D2 V denotes the Hessian of V . These equations are Hamiltonian and conserve the energy\n1 dx 2 1\nE=\n\u2212 |DV (x)|2 .\n2 ds\n2\nThus heteroclinic orbits connecting critical points of V via the equation (2.9), for\nwhich E is necessarily zero, satisfy\ndx\n= |DV (x)|.\nds\n\n(2.10)\n\nHence, if there is a heteroclinic orbit connecting critical points of V under either\nof the forward or backward gradient flows\ndx\n= \u00b1DV (x)\nds\n\n(2.11)\n\nthen this will also determine a heteroclinic orbit in the Hamiltonian system. However, the converse is not necessarily the case: there are heteroclinic orbits in the\nHamiltomnian flow which are not heteroclinic orbits in the gradient dynamics.\nWe say that a potential V : RN \u2192 R is admissible if V \u2208 C 3 (RN , R) and\n1. the set of critical points\nE = {x \u2208 RN | DV (x) = 0}\nis finite;\n2. the Hessian D2 V (x) has no zero eigenvalues for every x \u2208 E;\n3. the weak coercivity condition\n\u2203R > 0 such that inf |DV (x)| > 0\n|x|>R\n\n(2.12)\n\nis satisfied.\nAdmissibility implies, in particular, that all critical points for the gradient flows\n(2.11) are hyperbolic.\nFor each pair x\u2212 , x+ \u2208 E the set of transition paths is defined as\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u2212 +\n\u00b1\n2\nX(x , x ) = y \u2208 BV (R)\nlim y(t) = x and \u1e8f \u2208 L (R) .\nt\u2192\u00b1\u221e\n\n5\n\n\fLemma 2.1. For any x \u2208 X(x\u2212 , x+ )\n\u0001\n\u0001\nJ(x) \u2265 V x+ \u2212 V x\u2212 .\n\n(2.13)\n\nFurthermore, if the infimum of J over X(x\u2212 , x+ ) is attained at x? \u2208 X(x\u2212 , x+ ),\nthen x? \u2208 C 2 (R) satisfies the Euler-Lagrange equation (2.9) and has the property\nZ \u221e\n\u00012\n?\nDV x?

If either x\u2212 or x+ is a local minimum or\nmaximum and there exists a heterclinic orbit x? connecting x\u2212 and x+ under the\nHamiltonian dynamics (2.9), then x? solves (2.11) and\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(2.15)\nJ(x? ) = V x+ \u2212 V x\u2212 .\nIn particular x? is a minimizer of J which attains the lower bound the lower bound\n(2.13).\nProof.

Standard\nregularity results imply that minimizers x of J are C 2 (R) and satisfy the EulerLagrange equation (2.9). Equation (2.14) then follows from (2.10).\nTo prove the final result we first note that the linearization of equation (2.9) at\na critical point xc \u2208 E is given by\nd2 y\n\u2212 D2 V (xc )2 y = 0,\nds2\n\n(2.16)\n\nwhilst the forward gradient flow, given by (2.11) with a minus sign, has linearization\ndy\n+ D2 V (xc )y = 0.\n(2.17)\nds\nIf V is admissible, and xc is a critical point of V , then (0, xc ) is hyperbolic for\nthe Hamiltonian flow and, from (2.16), has stable and unstable manifolds both of\ndimension N.\nWe assume next that x+ is a local minimum of V . Let M be the N -dimensional\nmanifold defined by\nM = {(x, \u2212DV (x)) | x \u2208 RN } \u2282 R2N .\n6\n\n\fDifferentiating equation (2.11) with respect to t shows that M is invariant under\nthe flow of equation (2.9). Since D2 V (x+ ) is positive definite there exists \u03b5 > 0\nsuch that all solutions y(t) of equation (2.9) with the properties |y(0) \u2212 x+ | < \u03b5\nand \u1e8f(0)) = \u2212DV (y(0)) converge to x+ as t tends to infinity. Define next the\nstable manifold\no\nn\nM(x+ ) = (x, v) \u2208 R2N lim y(t) = x+ ,\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nwhere y solves (2.9) and satisfies the initial condition y(0) = x, \u1e8f(0) = v. Since\nthe dimension of M(x+ ) is N the sets M(x+ ) \u2229 {|x \u2212 x+ | < \u03b5} and M \u2229 {|x \u2212\nx+ | < \u03b5} coincide. Thanks to the invariance of M it follows that M(x+ ) \u2282 M.\nAs a result one obtains that\nZ \u221e\n?\nJ(x ) = \u2212\nDV (x? (t))x \u0307? = V (x\u2212 ) \u2212 V (x+ ) \u2265 0,\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere the last inequality holds because (2.11) implies that V is a decreasing Lyapunov function along the trajectory x? . Thus, the claim has been proven under the\nassumtion that x+ is a local minimum. The remaining three cases (x+ is a local\nmaximum, x\u2212 is a local minimum/maximum) can be dealt with in an analogous\nfashion.\nThe result shows that only saddle-saddle connections can give rise to heteroclinic orbits in the Hamiltonian system (2.9) which cannot be found by in one of the\ngradient flows (2.11). As a closing remark in this section we observe that the existence of heteroclinic orbit in (2.9) is a generic property of non-degenerate systems.\nFor the Hamiltonian flow the effective dimension of the space is 2N \u2212 1, because\nit is constrained to a level set of the Hamiltonian. Since the stable and unstable\nmanifolds for the Hamiltonian system are both of dimension N (cf eq. (2.16)) we\nexpect that, generically, there will be a 1 dimensional manifold connecting any pair\nof equilibria under the Hamiltonian flow.\n\n3\n\nThe \u0393\u2212Limit\n\nWe now determine the \u0393\u2212limit for the Onsager-Machlup function (2.6). A thorough introduction to \u0393-convergence can be found in [7] and [6]. Problems closely\nrelated to ours are studied using \u0393-convergence in [10, 11].\nWe start with some basic definitions and propositions which serve to explain\nthe form of the \u0393\u2212limit. The key result is contained in Proposition 3.2 which\ndemonstrates that every transition is achieved via a finite collection of intermediate\ntransitions. The limit Theorem 3.4 is then stated and proved, building on a number\nof lemmas which follow it.\nRecall the definition of admissible potential V , as well as that of a transition\npath.\nProposition 3.1. Let V be admissible and define for each pair x\u2212 , x+ \u2208 E the\nfunction \u03a6(x\u2212 , x+ ) by\n\b\n\u03a6(x\u2212 , x+ ) = inf J(y) y \u2208 X(x\u2212 , x+ ) .\n7\n\n\fThen there exists c > 0 such that \u03a6(x\u2212 , x+ ) > c for all pairs x\u00b1 \u2208 E with\nx\u2212 6= x+ .\nWe can establish a direct representation of the transition energy \u03a6 which avoids\nthe usage of infima.\nProposition 3.2. Let V be admissible and x\u00b1 \u2208 E be two critical points of V .\nThen there exists a finite sequence {xi }ki=0 \u2208 E such that x0 = x\u2212 , xk = x+ and\n\u03a6(x\u2212 , x+ ) =\n\nk\nX\n\nmin {J(y) | y \u2208 X(xi\u22121 , xi ) } ,\n\ni=1\n\nA straight-forward refinement of the analysis shows that the sequence xi is\ninjective.\nDefinition 3.3. Let X be a Banach-space, \u03b5 > 0 a parameter and I\u03b5 : X \u2192 R a\nfamily of functionals. The functional I0 : X \u2192 R \u222a {+\u221e} is the \u0393\u2212limit of I\u03b5 as\n\u03b5 \u2192 0 if for all x \u2208 X and all sequences x\u03b5 \u2208 X which converge weak-* to x as \u03b5\ntends to 0 the liminf-inequality\nlim inf I\u03b5 (x\u03b5 ) \u2265 I0 (x)\n\u03b5\u21920\n\nholds, and for all z \u2208 X, there exists a recovery sequence z\u03b5 \u2208 X which converges\nweak-* to z and satisfies\nlim sup I\u03b5 (z\u03b5 ) \u2264 I0 (z).\n\u03b5\u21920\n\nTheorem 3.4. Let V be an admissible potential. Then the \u0393-limit of the functional\nI\u03b5 as \u03b5 tends to 0 is\n\uf8f1 P\nR1\n\uf8f4\n\u03a6(x\u2212 (\u03c4 ), x+ (\u03c4 )) \u2212 0 \u2206V (x(s)) ds if x \u2208 BV ([0, 1])\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u03c4 \u2208D\nand x(s) \u2208 E a.e. s \u2208 [0, 1],\nI0 (x) =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n+\u221e else,\nwhere D(x) is the set of discontinuity points of x and x\u00b1 (\u03c4 ) are the left and rightsided limits of x at \u03c4 .\nProposition 3.2 shows that the infimum \u03a6 can be written as a finite sum of\nminima. These minima are obtained from evaluation of (2.14), where x? solves\n(2.9) subject to x? (t) \u2192 xi\u22121 /xi as t \u2192 \u00b1\u221e. Furthermore, if either xi \u2212 1 or xi\nis a local extremum of V , then x? is also a heteroclinic orbit in one of the gradient\nflows (2.11), then the minimum is given by (2.15). Thus Theorem 3.4 shows that\nthe \u0393\u2212limit of I\u03b5 can be computed through knowledge of the critical points of V\nand the set of (Hamiltonian or gradient) heteroclinic orbits connecting them.\nWe start the proof of Theorem 3.4 by proving a lemma which delivers a lower\nbound for the amount of energy needed to reach one of the stationary points x \u2208 E\nwhen starting nearby. We will often write x\u00b1 as a shorthand for {x\u2212 , x+ }.\n8\n\n\fLemma 3.5. Let V be an admissible potential. There exists numbers C, \u03b50 > 0\nsuch that for and all \u03b5 \u2208 [0, \u03b50 ], x\u00b1 \u2208 E and all all paths y \u2208 X(x\u2212 , x+ ) with\ndist(y(0), x\u00b1 ) \u2265 \u03b5 the estimate\nJ(y) \u2265\n\n1 2\n\u03b5\n2C\n\nholds.\nProof. We first show that there exist numbers \u03b4, C > 0 such that, for all x, y \u2208 RN\nwith x \u2208 E and with the property |y \u2212 x| < \u03b4, the estimates\n1\n|y \u2212 x|2 \u2264 |DV (y)|2 \u2264 C|y \u2212 x|2\nC\n\n(3.1)\n\nIndeed, thanks to the smoothness of V and nondegeneracy condition det(D2 V (x)) 6=\n0 for x \u2208 E, for sufficiently small \u03b5 and large C\u0303\nDV (y) \u2212 D2 V (x) * (y \u2212 x) \u2264 C\u0303|y \u2212 x|2 ,\n|z| \u2264 C\u0303 D2 V (x) * z\n\n\u2200z \u2208 RN\n\nhold. Thus\n|DV (y)| \u2265 |D2 V (x) * (y \u2212 x)| \u2212 C\u0303|y \u2212 x|2\n\u2265\n\n1\n|y\nC\u0303\n\n\u2212 x| \u2212 C\u0303|y \u2212 x|2 \u2265\n\n1\n|y\n2C\u0303\n\n\u2212 x|\n\nif |y \u2212 x| \u2264 min{\u03b4, 2C\u03031 2 }. This shows that the first inequality in (3.1) holds. The\nsecond inequality is obtained in a similar way.\nLet y \u2208 X(x\u2212 , x+ ) and recall\n\u0001by Sobolev's imbedding theorem y is con\b that\n1\ntinuous. For each \u03b5 \u2208 0, min \u03b4, 2C 2 we define\n\b\nt+ (\u03b5) = min s \u2208 R |y(t0 ) \u2212 x+ | < \u03b5 for all t0 > s ,\n(3.2)\nand t\u2212 analogous. Then we obtain\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\n1\nJ(y) \u2265\n|DV (y(s))| |\u1e8f(s)| ds \u2265\n(x+ \u2212 y) * \u1e8f(s) ds\n2C\n+\n+\nt (\u03b5)\nt (\u03b5)\n1\n1\n=\n|y(t+ (\u03b5)) \u2212 x+ |2 =\n\u03b52 .\n4C\n4C\nThe claim follows since we can derive the same estimate with t\u2212 instead of t+ .\nProof of Proposition 3.1. Let r > 0 be the separation of the stationary points of V ,\ni.e\nr = min{|x \u2212 x0 | | x, x0 \u2208 E, x 6= x0 },\nand let yl \u2208 X(x\u2212 , x+ ) be such that liml\u2192\u221e J(yl ) = \u03a6(x\u2212 , x+ ). There exists a sequence tl \u2208 R such that that dist(yl (tl ), E) \u2265 r/2 and thus Lemma 3.5\napplied to the translated sequence yl (* \u2212 tl ) implies that inf l J(yl ) \u2265 c, with\n1\nc = 2C\nmin{r/2, \u03b50 }2 .\n9\n\n\fThe proof of Proposition 3.2, showing the existence of minimizing connecting\norbits, is established with the direct method of the calculus of variations, with the\naid of the following lemma.\nLemma 3.6. Let x\u00b1 \u2208 E. If there exists a minimizing sequence\n{yl }l\u2208N \u2208 X(x\u2212 , x+ )\n\u0001\n1\n2\n2\nsuch that the density \u03c1l (t) = 2 |\u1e8fl (t)| + |DV (yl (t))| is tight in L1 (R), then\nthere exits a minimizer y \u00b1 \u2208 X(x\u2212 , x+ ) such that J(y \u00b1 ) = \u03a6(x\u2212 , x+ ).\nProof. First we show that the boundary conditions are not lost during the passage\nto the limit. The tightness of \u03c1l implies that for each \u03b5 > 0 there exists \u03c4 \u00b1 (\u03b5) \u2208 R\nwith \u03c4 \u2212 (\u03b5) < \u03c4 + (\u03b5) and the property that, for all l,\nZ\n\u0001\n1 2\n1\n|\u1e8fl |2 + |DV (yl (s))|2 ds \u2264\n\u03b5 ,\n(3.3)\nlim sup\n2\n4C\n\u2212\n+\nl\u2192\u221e\nR\\(\u03c4 ,\u03c4 )\nwhere C is the constant in Lemma 3.5. Let\n\b\n0\n+\nt+\nl (\u03b5) = min s \u2208 R |yl (t ) \u2212 x | < \u03b5\n\nfor all t0 > s ,\n\n+\n\u2212\nand t\u2212\nl analogously. Without loss of generality we assume that t (\u03b5) \u2264 0 \u2264 tl (\u03b5)\n\u00b1\nand |yl (0) \u2212 x | \u2265 \u03b5. Then Lemma 3.5 implies that\nZ\n\u0001\n1 \u221e\n1 2\nlim sup\n|\u1e8fl |2 + |DV (yl (s))|2 ds \u2265\n\u03b5 .\n+\n2\n4C\nl\u2192\u221e\ntl\n+\nTogether with inequality (3.3) we obtain that lim supl\u2192\u221e t+\nl (\u03b5) \u2264 \u03c4 (\u03b5). Another\n+\n\u2212\napplication of this argument with t replaced by t delivers the desired result\nconcerning the boundary conditions: for each \u03b5 > 0 there exists \u2212\u221e < \u03c4 \u2212 (\u03b5) <\n\u03c4 + (\u03b5) < \u221e such that\n\uf8f1\n+\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 lim sup sup+ |yl (s) \u2212 x | \u2264 \u03b5,\nl\u2192\u221e s\u2265\u03c4\n(3.4)\nlim\nsup sup |yl (s) \u2212 x\u2212 | \u2264 \u03b5.\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u2212\nl\u2192\u221e\n\ns\u2264\u03c4\n\n\u0001\nFrom the bound on \u1e8fl in L2 \u03c4 \u2212 (\u03b5), \u03c4 + (\u03b5) we deduce that the length of the vector\nyl (0) \u2208 RN is bounded. Since J(yl ) is bounded the sequence \u1e8fl is bounded in\nL2 (R). We extract a subsequence yl (not relabeled) such that \u1e8fl converges weakly\nto \u03b7 \u2208 L2 (R) and yl (0) converges to z \u2208 Rd .\nWe define the limiting path y \u00b1 by\nZ t\n\u00b1\ny (t) = z +\n\u03b7(s) ds\n0\n\nEquation (3.4) implies that lims\u2192\u00b1\u221e y \u00b1 (s) = x\u00b1 , i.e. the boundary conditions\nare satisfied.\n10\n\n\fNext we demonstrate that y \u00b1 is a minimizer, i.e.\nlim J(yl ) = J(y \u00b1 ).\n\nl\u2192\u221e\n\nNote that J is weakly lower semicontinuous: the first term is weakly lower semicontinuous because it is convex whilst the second term is weakly continuous. To\nsee the weak continuity note that\nZ R\nZ\n\u00b1\n|DV (y \u00b1 (s))| ds\n|DV (y (s))| ds = lim\nR\u2192\u221e \u2212R\n\nR\n\nZ\n= lim lim\n\nR\n\nR\u2192\u221e l\u2192\u221e \u2212R\n\nZ\n|DV (yl (s))| ds = lim\n\n\u221e\n\nl\u2192\u221e \u2212\u221e\n\n|DV (yl (s))| ds.\n\nThe last equation is again due to the tightness of J(yl ), the second but last equation\nholds because of Sobolev's embedding theorem. The weak lower semiconinuity of\nJ, coupled with the fact that {yl } is a minimizing sequence, shows that J(y \u00b1 ) =\nliml\u2192\u221e J(yl ).\nFinally we show that \u1e8f \u00b1 \u2208 L1 (R), which entails the claim y \u00b1 \u2208 X(x\u2212 , x+ ).\nDefine the functional\nZ\n\u0001\n1 \u221e\nGt (y) =\n|\u1e8f(s)|2 + |DV (y(s)|2 ds,\n2 t\nand the function g(t) = Gt (y \u00b1 ). Note that (y \u00b1 (s))s\u2265t minimizes Gt (y) for every\nt, subject to the boundary condition y(t) = y \u00b1 (t). Testing Gt (*) with a function\nwhich is affine on [t, t + 1] and assumes the value x+ for all s \u2265 t + 1 together\nwith estimate (3.1) delivers the bound\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ 1\n\u0001\n1 \u00b1\n1\nC\n+ 2\n2\ng(t) \u2264 |y (t) \u2212 x |\n1 + Cs ds =\n1+\n|y \u00b1 (t) \u2212 x+ |2 . (3.5)\n2\n2\n3\n0\nRecall that limt\u2192\u221e y \u00b1 (t) = x+ and choose t0 > 0 such that |y(t) \u2212 x+ | < \u03b50\nfor all t > t0 , where \u03b50 is defined in Lemma 3.5. The function g satisfies for all\nt > t0 the differential inequality\n\u2212\nwith \u03bc =\n\ndg\n1\n1 \u00b1\n(t) \u2265 |DV (y \u00b1 (t))|2 \u2265\n|y (t) \u2212 x+ |2 \u2265 \u03bcg(t),\ndt\n2\n2C\n\n3\n(3+C)C .\n\nThe last inquality is (3.5), the penultimate inequlity is due\n\nto (3.1). Gronwall's inequality implies the exponential decay bound g(t) \u2264 \u03b5o e\u2212\u03bc(t\u2212t0 ) .\n1\nSince |\u1e8f \u00b1 (t)|2 \u2264 \u22122 dg\ndt (t) we have shown that \u1e8f \u2208 L ([t0 , \u221e)). The same argu\u00b1\n1\n\u00b1\nment also shows that y \u2208 L ((\u2212\u221e, t0 ]) and thus y \u2208 L1 (R).\nThe proof of Proposition 3.2 also relies on Lions' concentration compactness\nlemma which we state here for completeness.\n11\n\n\fLemma 3.7.

Let yl \u2208 X(x\u2212 , x+ ) be a minimizing sequence of J and\ndefine \u03c1l (t) as in Lemma 3.6. We now use Lemma 3.7 in the following way: we\nshow that vanishing cannot occur, and that splitting can only occur a finite number\nof times.\nTo rule out vanishing we define, for real number \u03b5 satisfying\n\u0010 1\n\u0011\n\u03b5 \u2208 0, min{|x \u2212 z| x, z \u2208 E, x 6= z} ,\n2\nthe starting and ending time of the final transition:\n\u001a\n\u001b\n+\n+\ntl = sup t \u2208 R | inf |yl (s) \u2212 x | \u2265 \u03b5 ,\ns\u2264t\n\b\n\u2212\n+\ntl = sup t \u2264 tl | dist(yl (t), E \\ {x+ }) \u2264 \u03b5 .\n+\nBy construction t\u2212\nl \u2264 tl and Jensen's inequality implies that\n\nZ\n\nt+\nl\n\nt\u2212\nl\n\n1\n\u03c1l (s) ds \u2265\n2\n\nZ\n\nt+\nl\n\nt\u2212\nl\n\n\u0012\n\ndist(x+ , E \\ {x+ }) \u2212 2\u03b5\nt+\nl \u2212 tl \u2212\n2\n\n=\n\n(dist(x+ , E \\ {x+ }) \u2212 2\u03b5)\n.\n\u2212\n2(t+\nl \u2212 tl )\n12\n\n\u00132\nds\n\n\fR\n\u2212\nSince lim supl\u2192\u221e R \u03c1l (s) ds < \u221e this implies that lim inf l\u2192\u221e (t+\nl \u2212 tl ) > 0.\nFurthermore, since V admissible there exists a number c > 0 such that inf s\u2208[t\u2212 ,t+ ] \u03c1l (s) \u2265\nl\nl\nc and thus\nZ t+\nl\n1\n\u2212\nlim sup(t+\nl \u2212 tl ) \u2264 c lim sup \u2212 \u03c1l (s) ds < \u221e.\nl\u2192\u221e\nl\u2192\u221e\ntl\nThis pair of inequalities shows that \u03c1l does not vanish.\nIf the sequence \u03c1l splits, then there exist sequences al \u2264 bl such that [al , bl ] \u2229\nsupp(\u03c11l + \u03c12l ) = \u2205 and\nlim (al \u2212 bl ) = \u221e,\nZ \u221e\n\u03c1l (t) dt > 0 and lim inf\n\u03c1l (t) dt > 0.\nl\u2192\u221e\n\nZ\n\nal\n\nlim inf\nl\u2192\u221e\n\nl\u2192\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(3.6)\n(3.7)\n\nbl\n\nWe claim now that there exists a third sequence tl \u2208 [al , bl ] and a stationary point\nx \u2208 E such that liml\u2192\u221e yl (tl ) = x.

An analogous argument can be constructed for the case x = x+ and\nthus x \u2208 E \\ {x\u00b1 }.\nThe construction yields the following equation\n\u03a6(x\u2212 , x+ ) \u2265 lim J(yl1 + yl2 \u2212 x) \u2265 lim inf J(yl1 ) + lim inf J(yl2 )\nl\u2192\u221e\n\u2212\n\nl\u2192\u221e\n\nl\u2192\u221e\n\n+\n\n\u2265\u03a6(x , x) + \u03a6(x, x ).\nProgressing inductively we obtain a sequence x0 , x1 , . . . , xk \u2208 E such that\nx0 = x\u2212 , xk = x+ , xi\u22121 6= xi for all i = 1 . . . k and\n\u2212\n\n+\n\n\u03a6(x , x ) \u2265\n\nk\nX\n\n\u03a6(xi\u22121 , xi ).\n\ni=1\n\nProposition 3.1 implies that k \u2264 \u03a6(x\u2212 , x+ )/c, placing a finite bound on the number of splittings possible. The minimizing sequences associated with X(xi\u22121 , xi )\nare eventually tight and so achieve their contribution to the infimum at a minimizer\nof J.\nProof of Theorem 3.4. Now the representation formula for the \u0393-limit will be verified. Let x \u2208 BV ([0, 1], Rd ) be a limit path and x\u03b5 \u2208 H 1 (0, 1) such that x\u03b5\nconverges to x weak-* in BV ([0, 1]). First we show that the Laplacian can be\ntreated separately. Since weak-* convergence entails boundedness in BV there\nis a constant C > 0 such that lim sup\u03b5\u21920 kx\u03b5 kL\u221e \u2264 C. Furthermore, thanks to\nHelly's theorem we can select a subsequence which converges pointwise for almost\nevery s \u2208 [0, 1] and therefore by dominated convergence\nZ\nlim\n\n\u03b5\u21920 0\n\n1\n\nZ\n\u2206V (x\u03b5 (s)) ds =\n\n1\n\n\u2206V (x(s)) ds.\n0\n\nNote that only continuity of \u2206V is required for this step. This implies that\nZ 1\nlim inf I\u03b5 (x\u03b5 ) = lim inf J\u03b5 (x\u03b5 ) \u2212\n\u2206V (x(s)) ds\n(3.10)\n\u03b5\u21920\n\n\u03b5\u21920\n\n0\n\nwith J\u03b5 as defined in (2.7).\nNext we consider the case where the set of times s where the limit function\nx(s) \u2208 E does not have full measure, so that I0 (x) = \u221e. Define\nM = meas ({t \u2208 [0, 1] | x(t) 6\u2208 E}) .\n\n14\n\n\fThere exists \u03b4 > 0 such that\nlim inf meas ({t \u2208 [0, 1] | dist(x(t), E) > \u03b4}) > M/2.\n\u03b5>0\n\nSince V satisfies the weak coercivity condition the infimum of |DV (x)| exceeds\nsome \u03bb > 0, on this set with measure exceeding M/2. Thus\nZ 1\n1\nM 2\nlim inf J\u03b5 (x\u03b5 ) \u2265 lim inf\n|DV (x\u03b5 (s))|2 ds \u2265 lim inf\n\u03bb = +\u221e.\n\u03b5\u21920\n\u03b5\u21920 2\u03b5 0\n\u03b5\u21920 4\u03b5\nFinally we consider the case where I0 (x) is finite. The proof of the lim infinequality follows directly from the definition, as we now show. Since x \u2208 BV ([0, 1])\nand I0 (x) is finite, the set of discontinuity points D \u2282 [0, 1] is finite. We assume\nnext that D \u2282 (0, 1), i.e. x is continuous at the end-points. If x jumps at one or\nboth end points the same argument can be repeated with obvious modifications of\nthe cut-offs.\nThanks to this assumption for each \u03c4 \u2208 D the left-sided and right-sided limits\nx\u00b1 (\u03c4 ) exist. Since x\u03b5 converges weak-* in BV ([0, 1]) to the piecewise constant\nfunction x Helly's theorem implies that lim\u03b5\u21920 x\u03b5 (t) = x(t) for almost every\nt \u2208 [0, 1] \\ D.

The intuitive picture of the \u0393\u2212limit is that it is comprised\nof minimizers with the following properties:\n\n16\n\n\f1. The minimizers are BV functions supported on the set of critical points of V\n(see Theorem 3.4).\n2. The contribution to the limit functional from the jumps in these\nR \u2212\u221e BV functions\n(ie from J\u03b5 ) can be expressed in terms of sums of integrals \u221e |DV (x? (s))|2 ds\nwhere x? is a heteroclinic orbit for the Hamiltonian equations (2.9) (see\nLemma 2.1, equation (2.14)).\n3. Unless both equilibria x\u00b1 are saddle points, then these heteroclinic orbits\nwill also be heteroclinic for the gradient system (2.11) and then the contribution to the limit functional from J\u03b5 can be expressed in terms of sums\n|V (x? (\u221e)) \u2212 V (x? (\u2212\u221e))| (see Lemma 2.1, equation (2.15)).\n4. Minimizers x? will seek to organize\nR 1 the support of the limiting BV function\nso as to minimize the value of 0 4V (x? )(s)ds; this is the second contribution to the infimum defined in Theorem 3.4.\nA variety of numerical computations, all of which exhibit these phenomena on\na range of problems, including high dimensional systems arising in vacancy diffusion and the Lennard-Jones 38 cluster, may be found in the paper [5]. The purpose\nof this section is to illustrate the four points above on a single low dimensional\nexample and relate the results in an explicit way to the theory developed in earlier\nsections. We employ the potential V : R2 \u2192 R given by\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nV (x1 , x2 ) = x21 + x22 (x1 \u2212 1)2 + x22 x21 + (x2 \u2212 1)2\nwhich is shown in Figure 1. The potential has three wells of equal depth, situated at\u221aM0 = (0, 0),\u221aM1 =\u0001 (1, 0), and M2 = (0, 1). Saddle points\nexist at\u221aS1 = \u0001\n\u221a\n(2 + 2)/6, (2 \u2212 2)/6 and (by symmetry) at S2 = (2 \u2212 2)/6, (2 + 2)/6 .\nThe potential is zero at the minima and attains a value of 2/27 at the saddles. The\nLaplacian of V has value zero at the saddle points, 4 at the minimum M0 and 8 at\nthe minima M1 and M2 .\nIn the following numerical experiments we use gradient descent to minimize\nI\u03b5 or J\u03b5 given by (2.8) and (2.7). In all the experiments we employ a value of\n\u03b5\u22121 = 10\u22123 which proved to be small enough to exhibit the behaviour of the\n\u0393\u2212limit. We solve the parabolic PDE arising from the L2 gradient flow for I\u03b5\n(resp. J\u03b5 ) by means of a linearly implicit method with stepsize chosen to ensure\ndecrease of I\u03b5 (resp. J\u03b5 ) at each time-step.\nFigure 2 shows heteroclinic orbits for the gradient flow (2.11) (in green) and\nfor the Hamiltonian flow (2.9) (in blue). Figure 3 shows minimizers of J\u03b5 , both\nconnecting M1 and M2 . It is instructive to compare this figure with the preceding\nFigure 2. The green curve in Figure 3 connects M1 to M2 via M0 and is comprised\nof 4 segments each of which has been verified to be approximately given by the\ngradient heteroclinic orbits (2.11). The blue curve connects M1 to M2 via S1 and\nS2 and has been verified to be approximately given by Hamiltonian heteroclinic\norbits satisfying (2.9). Furthermore, in the gradient case we have verified that\nthe minimizers obey the sum rule (2.15) This illustrates the connection between\nminimizers of J\u03b5 and solutions of the Euler Lagrange equations for minimizers of\nJ, and points 2. and 3. in particular.\nFigures 4 and 5 show minimizers of J\u03b5 and I\u03b5 which connect the two saddle\npoints S1 and S2 . Several approximate minimizers are shown in each case, found\n17\n\n\fFigure 1: Contour plot of the potential. The dashed black line is the equipotential\ncontour that connects the saddle points, S1 and S2 . The three equal-depth minima\nare labeled: M0 , M1 , and M2 .\n\n18\n\n\fFigure 2: The dashed black line is the equipotential contour that connects the saddle points, S1 and S2 . The green line is the path the follows the gradient of the\npotential from M1 to M0 via S1 and then to M2 via S2 . The blue line is a Hamiltonian minimizer (not a gradient flow) that connects S1 to S2 .\n\n19\n\n\fFigure 3: Solutions that minimize J\u03b5 at \u03b5 = 10\u22123 . The dashed black line is the\nequipotential contour that connects the saddle points, S1 and S2 . The green line\nis the path that starts at M1 and proceeds to M2 via M0 . The blue line is the path\npath that starts at M1 and proceeds to M2 avoiding M0 .\n\n20\n\n\ffrom different starting points for the gradient flow. The experiments illustrate point\n1. as they show that the solutions concentrate on critical points of V : in this case\nsimply the two saddles. They also illustrate point 4. as they show that, in this case,\nthe minimizers of J\u03b5 and I\u03b5 are indistinguishable; this is because the Laplacian of\nV is zero at the saddle points.\nFigures 6 and 7 also show minimizers of J\u03b5 and I\u03b5 which connect the two\nsaddle points S1 and S2 . However the starting points for the gradient flow differ\nfrom those used to generate Figures 4 and 5; in particular they are based on a\nfunction which passes through the minimum M0 . As a consequence the minimizers\nalso pass through M0 . For J\u03b5 there are then multiple approximate minimizers, all\nsupported on S1 , S2 and M0 . However the support can be organized more or less\narbitrarily (provided only two transitions occur) to obtain approximately the same\nvalue of J\u03b5 ; we show a solution where the support is organized symmetrically.\nThe situation for I\u03b5 is quite different: the effect of the Laplacian of V , which is\n4 at M0 and 0 at S1 and S2 , means that minimizers place most of their support at\nM0 . The experiments thus again illustrate point 1. as they show that the solutions\nconcentrate on critical points of V . They also illustrate point 4.\n\nFigure 4: The x1 component of the paths that minimize J\u03b5 at \u03b5 = 10\u22123 . The paths\nstart at S1 and are conditioned to end at S2 . The ending path depends on the nature\nof the starting path. The results of using three different starting paths are displayed.\nNone of the initial paths approach the origin and thus avoid passing through M0 .\nThe black curve corresponds to a symmetric minimizer.\nFigures 8 and 9 again show minimizers of J\u03b5 and I\u03b5 , now connecting the two\nminima M1 and M2 , and constructed to pass through the other minimum M0 and\nthe two saddle points S1 and S2 . For J\u03b5 there are then multiple approximate minimizers, all supported on the five critical points, one of which is shown in Figure\n8, a solution where the support is organized symmetrically. The situation for I\u03b5 is\nagain very different: the effect of the Laplacian of V , which is 8 at M1 and M2 ,\nmeans that minimizers place most of their support at these two points, as shown in\nFigure 9. The single interface in fact contains several transitions, and hence several\ncontributions to the \u0393\u2212limit. Furthermore this single interface can be placed ar21\n\n\fFigure 5: The x1 component of the paths that minimize I\u03b5 at \u03b5 = 10\u22123 . The\npaths start at S1 and are conditioned to end at S2 . The ending path depends on\nthe nature of the starting path. The results of using three different starting paths\nare displayed. None of the initial paths approach the origin and thus avoid passing\nthrough M0 . The black curve corresponds to a symmetric minimizer. Note that\nthis plot is indistinguishable from the previous one.\n\nFigure 6: The x1 component of the path that minimize J\u03b5 at \u03b5 = 10\u22123 . The path\nstarts at S1 and is conditioned to end at S2 . The initial path contains the origin M0\nand thus the ending path spends an arbitrary fraction of the time at M0 . The ending\npath depends on the nature of the starting path, in particular where the path crosses\nthe origin. Only the symmetric minimizer is displayed here.\n22\n\n\fFigure 7: The x1 component of the path that minimize I\u03b5 at \u03b5 = 10\u22123 . The path\nstarts at S1 and is conditioned to end at S2 . The initial path contains the origin M0\nand thus the ending path is dominated by M0 .\nbitrarily; we have shown a symmetric case. The experiments once again illustrate\npoints 1. and 4.\nAcknowledgements. The authors are grateful to Eric Vanden Eijnden for helpful\ndisucssions.
