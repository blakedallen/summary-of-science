We show\nthat this model allows a natural treatment of the large and small scale redshift space\ndistortions, which we develop here, which extends the pedagogical value of the approach.\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe power spectrum of the mass fluctuations in the universe is one of the most fundamental quantities in large-scale\nstructure. It is robust, but sensitive to several cosmological\nparameters such as the Hubble constant, the matter density and of course the primordial power spectrum (usually\nparameterized by an amplitude and a slope). While the theory behind the power spectrum in the linear regime is quite\nstraightforward, analytically handling clustering in the nonlinear regime has proven quite difficult. Recently several authors (Ma & Fry 2000; Seljak 2000; Peacock 2000; Peacock\n& Smith 2000) have developed a new way of looking at the\nnon-linear power spectrum which imagines all the mass in\nthe universe lies in a halo of some mass (Press & Schechter\n1974). They postulate that on large scales the halos cluster\naccording to linear theory while on small scales the power\nis dominated by the halo profiles (Neyman, Scott & Shane\n1953; Peebles 1974). Specifically most pairs of dark matter particles with small interparticle separations lie within\nthe same halo, and thus their correlations can be predicted\nby the halo profile. While this model requires many ingredients to be fixed by numerical experiments (typically N-body\nsimulations) it provides a useful structure for thinking about\ngravitational clustering which gives insights into several outstanding problems (Seljak 2000; Peacock & Smith 2000; Seljak, Burwell & Pen 2000; Atrio-Barandela & Mucket 1999;\nCooray, Hu & Miralda-Escude 2000).\nThe work to date has all focussed on the clustering\nof the matter or galaxies in \"real space\", whereas many if\nnot most observations of clustering take place in \"redshift\nspace\". It is the purpose of this work to show that redshift space distortions can be handled naturally in the halo\npicture and that doing so provides insight into some well\nstudied phenomena.\n\n2\n\nTHE HALO MODEL\n\nThe model for non-linear clustering is based on the PressSchechter (1974) theory, in which all of the mass in the\nuniverse resides in a virialized halo of a certain mass. The\nextensions to this theory introduced recently allow one to\n\ncalculate the power spectra and cross correlations between\nboth the mass and the galaxies, given a suitable prescription for how galaxies populate dark matter halos. Since at\npresent such prescriptions are somewhat ad hoc we shall concentrate here on the mass power spectrum, though there is\nno obstacle in principle to extending the method to galaxies.\nIn this model the power spectrum, P (k), is the sum of\ntwo pieces. The first is that due to a system of (smooth)\nhalos of profile y(k) laid down with inter-halo correlations\nassumed to be a biased sampling of Plin (k). Since the real\nspace convolution is simply a Fourier space multiplication\nthis contribution is\nP\n\n2\u2212halo\n\n(k) = Plin (k)\n\n\u0014Z\n\nf (\u03bd)d\u03bd b(\u03bd)y(k; M )\n\n\u00152\n\n(1)\n\nwhere b(\u03bd) is the (linear) bias of a halo of mass M (\u03bd) and\nf (\u03bd) is the multiplicity function. The peak height \u03bd is related\nto the mass of the halo through\n\u03bd\u2261\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b4c\n\u03c3(M )\n\n\u00132\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b4c = 1.69 and \u03c3(M ) is the rms fluctuation in the\nmatter density smoothed with a top-hat filter on a scale\nR3 = 3M/4\u03c0 \u03c1\u0304. Both b and f come from fits to N-body\nsimulations. We use (Sheth & Tormen 1999)\nb(\u03bd) = 1 +\n\n2p\n\u03bd\u22121\n+\n\u03b4c\n\u03b4c (1 + \u03bd \u2032p )\n\n(3)\n\nand\n\u03bdf (\u03bd) = A(1 + \u03bd \u2032\u2212p )\u03bd \u20321/2 e\u2212\u03bd\n\n\u2032 /2\n\n(4)\n\n\u2032\n\nwhere p = 0.3 and \u03bd = 0.707\u03bd. The normalization constant\nA is fixed by the requirement that all of the mass lie in a\ngiven halo\n\nZ\n\nf (\u03bd)d\u03bd = 1\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\nWe assume that the halos all have spherical profiles depending only on the mass. We neglect any substructure or\nhalos-within-halos as this seems to be unimportant for the\npower spectrum. We take the 'NFW' form (Navarro, Frenk\n& White 1996)\n\n\f2\n\nM. White\nnormalized to the COBE 4-year data using the method of\nBunn & White (1997). The agreement in the linear regime is\ngood, as is to be expected. On smaller scales the model is a\nsurprisingly good fit to the N-body data given the simplicity\nof the assumptions. The slight shortfall in power at higher\nk can be remedied by modifying the prescription somewhat,\nbut we will here stick to the parameters outlined in (Seljak\n2000) - this model is valuable more for its pedagogical value\nthan as a substitute for direct calculations.\n\n3\n\nFigure 1.

The solid squares\nshow the results of N-body simulations. The lower solid line is the\nprediction for the redshift space power spectrum (Eq. 16) and the\nopen squares the N-body results. The contribution of the 2-halo\n(dotted) and 1-halo (dashed) terms to the total is also shown.\n\n\u03c1(r) =\n\n\u03c10\nx(1 + x)2\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere x = r/rs is a scaled radius, though our results\nare not particularly sensitive to this choice (Seljak 2000).\nThe mass of this halo is defined to be the virial mass\n3\nM = (4\u03c0/3)\u03b4vir \u03c1\u0304rvir\nwhere we take \u03b4vir = 200 and define\nthe virial radius, rvir , as the radius within which the mean\ndensity enclosed is \u03b4vir times the background density. The\nconcentration parameter c = rvir /rs . The profile can then\nbe described by its virial mass and concentration. N-body\nsimulations suggest the two are related and we follow (Seljak\n2000) in using\nc(M ) = 10\n\n\u0010\n\nM\nM\u2217\n\n\u0011\u22120.2\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03c3(M\u2217 ) = 1.\nFinally then we need y(k) which is the Fourier transform\nof Eq.

We have\nchosen a particular \u039bCDM model with \u03a9m = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7,\nh = 0.7, \u03a9B h2 = 0.02 and n = 1. The model has been\n\nREDSHIFT SPACE DISTORTIONS\n\nThe model described above naturally lends itself to a treatment of redshift space distortions. There are two effects\nwhich come in when moving to redshift space. The first is\na boost of power on large scales due to streaming of matter\ninto overdense regions. The second is a reduction of power\non small scales due to virial motions within an object. In\nthe halo model the large-scale and small-scale effects can be\nseparated out in a simple fashion.\nKaiser (1987) first showed that on large scales one expects an enhancement of the power spectrum in redshift\nspace. In linear theory a density perturbation \u03b4k generates\na velocity perturbation \u03b4\u0307 = \u2212ikv with ~v parallel to ~k. Using\ndensity conservation to linear order and making the distant\nobserver approximation (kr \u226b 1, we shall work throughout\nin the plane-parallel limit, see (Heavens & Taylor 1995; Szalay, Matsubara & Landy 1998) for a large-angle formalism)\nthe redshift space density contrast can be written as\n\u03b4redshift = \u03b4real 1 + f \u03bc2\n\n\u0001\n\n(11)\n\nwhere f (\u03a9) \u2261 d log \u03b4/d log a \u2243 \u03a90.6 , a is the scale-factor\nand \u03bc = r\u0302 * k\u0302. Thus on large-scales the power spectrum is\nincreased by\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\n+1\n\n\u22121\n\nd\u03bc\n\n1 + f \u03bc2\n\n\u00012\n\n=1+\n\n1\n2\nf + f2\n3\n5\n\n(12)\n\nwhich is approximately 1.37 in our model.\nOn small scales virial motions within collapsed objects\nreduce power in redshift space. If we assume that our halos\nare isotropic, virialized and isothermal with 1D velocity dispersion \u03c3 then the peculiar motions within the halo add a\nGaussian noise to the redshift space radial coordinate. Once\nagain the real space convolution becomes a Fourier space\nmultiplication and the inferred density contrast is\n\u03b4redshift = \u03b4real e\u2212(k\u03c3\u03bc)\n\n2\n\n/2\n\nIntegrating this over \u03bc gives a suppression\n\u221a\nq\n\u03c0 erf(y/ 2)\nR1 (y = k\u03c3) =\n2\ny\n\n(13)\n\n(14)\n\nAs pointed out by Peacock & Dodds (1994) however, the\n\"full\" effect of redshift space distortions includes both the\nenhancement and the suppression of power, and one must\ninclude the \u03bc dependence of both factors before doing the\nintegral. Including both terms the redshift space distortion\nbecomes, upon integrating over \u03bc,\n\u221a\n\u0003\n\u03c0 erf(y) \u0002 2\nR2 (y = k\u03c3) =\n3f + 4f y 2 + 4y 4\n8\ny5\n\n\fThe redshift space power spectrum in the halo model\n\n3\n\nmodel makes the same predictions as linear theory with a\nconstant \"effective\" bias\nhbi \u2261\n\nZ\n\nf (\u03bd)d\u03bd b(\u03bd)\n\n(19)\n\nThe high-k behavior of the model qualitatively reproduces\nthe suppression seen in the N-body simulations. This is not\nsurprising since Sheth (1996) and Diaferio & Geller (1996)\nhave shown that a sum of Gaussian random velocities\nweighted by the Press-Schechter (1974) mass function provides a good description of the exponential distribution of\nvelocities seen in N-body simulations.\nThe model underestimates the N-body results in Fig. 1\nin both real and redshift space. We show the prediction for\nthe ratio of redshift-space to real-space power in Fig. 2 compared to the same ratio from the N-body simulations. Here\nwe see that the agreement is very good over more than 2\ndecades in length scale.\nFigure 2. The ratio of power in redshift space, compared to\nreal space, from the halo model (solid line) and from N-body\nsimulations (points).\n\n\u2212y 2\n\n\u2212\n\ne\n4y 4\n\n\u0002\n\nf 2 (3 + 2y 2 ) + 4f y\n\n\u0003\n2\n\n(15)\n\nThus to predict the redshift space power spectrum in\nthe halo model we modify Eqs.

Technically we should do the integral\nover \u03bd including the Gaussian from Eq. (13) first and then\nintegrate over \u03bc. We can see in Fig. 2 however that this numerically simpler approximation works quite well. Note that\nin contrast to the real-space power spectrum the clustering\nterm remains significant to larger k.\nWe assume that the halos are isothermal.

Notice that the model provides an adequate description of the redshift space power spectrum. The clustering\nterm remains significant to smaller scales, which may explain why perturbation theory results seem to work better\nin redshift space than in real space and why the redshift\nspace power spectrum approximates the linear theory prediction over such a wide range of scales. At small-k this\n\n4\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nMany of the features of the power spectrum of density fluctuations in the universe can be simply understood in a model\nbased virialized halos. Important ingredients in the model\nare that the halos be biased tracers of the linear power spectrum and have a uniform profile with a correlation between\nthe internal structure and the mass which should span a wide\nrange sampling a a Press-Schechter (1974) like mass function. Within this model it is easy to account accurately for\nredshift space distortions which alter the power on large and\nsmall scales. The effects of virialized motions within halos\nsuppress the \"Poisson\" or 1-halo term, so the redshift space\npower spectrum traces the linear theory result to smaller\nphysical scales. This effect could be responsible for the fact\nthat perturbation theory is known to work better in redshift\nspace than real space when compared to numerical simulations.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nI thank U.
