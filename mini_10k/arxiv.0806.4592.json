To increase predictivity even further, we impose the constraint of renormalizability.\nA geometric interpretation of an A4 \u2212triplet aids our understanding\nof tribimaximal mixing.

An inverted hierarchy is\nimpossible without addition of more parameters by either more Higgs\nscalars or higher-order irrelevant operators.\n\n1\n\n\fIntroduction.\nIn particle theory phenomenology, model building fashions vary with time\nand because the present lack of data (soon to be compensated by the Large\nHadron Collider) does not allow discrimination between models some fashions develop a life of their own. In the present Letter we take the apparently retrogressive step of imposing the requirement of renormalizability#1\n, as holds for quantum electrodynamics (QED), quantum chromodynamics\n(QCD) and the standard electroweak model, to show that non-abelian flavor\nsymmetry becomes then much more restrictive and predictive. In a specific\nmodel we show that a normal neutrino mass hierarchy is strongly favored\nover an inverted hierarchy.\nFor several years now there has been keen interest in the use of A4 [1, 2]\nas a finite flavor symmetry in the lepton sector, especially neutrino mixing; other approaches are in [3]. In particular, the empirically approximate\ntribimaximal mixing [4] of the three neutrinos can be predicted. It is usually stated that either normal or inverted neutrino mass spectrum can be\npredicted.\nIn the present Letter we revisit these two questions in a minimal A4\nframework with only one A4 -3 of Higgs doublets coupling to neutrinos and\npermitting only renormalizable couplings. For such a minimal model there\nis more predicitivity regarding neutrino masses.\nAlthough the standard model was originally discovered using the criterion of renormalizability, it is sometimes espoused [5] that renormalizability\nis not prerequisite in an effective lagrangian. Nevertheless, imposing renormalizability in the present case is more sensible because it does render the\nmodel far more predictive by avoiding the many additional parameters associated with higher-order irrelevant operators. Our choice of Higgs sector also\nminimizes the number of free parameters.\nWe shall first discuss some geometry of A4 symmetry as follows.\nGeometry of A4 symmetry\nThe group A4 is the order g=12 symmetry of a regular tetrahedron T and\nis a subgroup of the rotation group SO(3). A4 has irreducible representations\n#1\n\nThe model we discuss has an anomaly which can be cancelled in a more complete\n\u2032\nT model incorporating quarks without affecting the results for leptons discussed in the\npresent article.\n\n2\n\n\fwhich are three singlets 11 , 12 , 13 and a triplet 3. In the embedding A4 \u2282\nSO(3) the 3 of A4 is identified with the adjoint 3 of SO(3).\nSince the only Higgs doublets coupling to neutrinos in our model are in a\n3 of A4 , it is very useful to understand geometrically the three components\nof a 3.\nA regular tetrahedron has four vertices, four faces and six edges. Straight\nlines joining the midpoints of opposite edges pass through the centroid and\nform a set of three orthogonal axes. Regarding the regular tetrahedron as the\nresult of cutting off the four odd corners from a cube, these axes are parallel\nto the sides of the cube (see Fig. 1). With respect to the regular tetrahedron,\na vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the 3 such as < 3 >= v(1, 1, \u22122), as\nwill be used,clearly breaks SO(3) to U(1) and correspondingly A4 to Z2 , since\nit requires a rotation by \u03c0 about the 3-axis to restore the tetrahedron.\nAt the same time, we can understand the appearance of tribimaximal\nmixing [6] with matrix [4]\nq q \uf8f6\n\uf8eb q\n1\n2\n\u2212 1\n\u2212\n\uf8ec q 6 q 6 q3 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n1\n1\n1 \uf8f7\n(1)\nUT BM = \uf8ec\n\uf8f7,\n3\n3\n3 \uf8f8\n\uf8ed q\nq\n1\n\u2212 12 0\n2\n\nand our definitions are such that the ordering \u03bd1,2,3 and \u03bd\u03c4,\u03bc,e satisfy\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\u03bd1\n\u03bd\u03c4\n\uf8ed \u03bd2 \uf8f8 = UT BM \uf8ed \u03bd\u03bc \uf8f8\n\u03bd3\n\u03bde\n\n(2)\n\nWith respect to a side of the aforementioned cube,\nq a face diagonal is at angle\n\n\u03c0/4 and the body diagonal is at angle tan\u22121 ( 12 ) with respect to the body\ndiagonal (see Fig. 2). These two angles, together with \u03b813 = 0 are the three\ncorresponding to the matrix of Eq.(1). As we shall show this mixing occurs\nnaturally for VEVs < 3 >\u221d (1, 1, 1) and < 3 >\u221d (1, 1, \u22122).\nAssuming no CP violation, the Majorana matrix Mnu is real and symmetric and therefore of the form\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nAB C\nM\u03bd = \uf8ed B D F \uf8f8\n(3)\nC F E\n3\n\n\fand is related to the diagonlized form by\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nm1 0 0\nMdiag = \uf8ed 0 m2 0 \uf8f8 = UT BM M\u03bd UTTBM .\n0 0 m3\n\n(4)\n\nSubstituting Eq.(1) into Eq.(4) shows that M\u03bd must be of the general form\nin terms of real parameters A, B, C:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nA B\nC\n\uf8f8,\nC\nM\u03bd = \uf8ed B A\n(5)\nC C A+B\u2212C\n\nwhich has eigenvalues\n\nm1 = (A + B \u2212 2C)\nm2 = (A + B + C)\nm3 = (A \u2212 B).\n\n(6)\n\nThe observed mass spectrum corresponds approximately to |m1 | = |m2 |\nwhich requires either C = 0 or C = 2(A + B). For a normal hierarchy,\n(A + B) = 0 and C = 0. For an inverted hierarchy A = B and C = 0 or\nC = 4A.\nNow we study our minimal A4 model to examine the occurrence of the\nMajorana matrix Eq.(5) and the eigenvalues Eq.(6).\nMinimal A4 model\nWe assign the leptons to (A4 , Z2 ) irreps as follows #2\n\u0012 \u0013 \uf8fc\n\u03bd\u03c4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u2212\n\uf8f4\n\u03c4\n(1)\n\uf8f4\n\u0013L \uf8f4\n\u0012\n\u03c4R\u2212 (11 , \u22121) NR (11 , +1)\n\uf8fd\n\u03bd\u03bc\n(2)\nLL (3, +1) \u03bc\u2212\nNR (12 , +1)\n\u2212\nR (12 , \u22121)\n\u03bc\n\uf8f4\n(3)\n\u0012 \u0013L \uf8f4\ne\u2212\n\uf8f4\nNR (13 , +1).\nR (13 , \u22121)\n\uf8f4\n\u03bde\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\ne\u2212 L\n\n(7)\n\nThe lagrangian is\n\n#2\n\nThese assignments differ from Ma-Rajasekharan [1] and from Altarelli-Feruglio [2].\nThe lagrangian, Eq.

From 1-3 symmetry, Eq. (14) and Eq.(15) are both satisfied only if\nV1 = V3 . Solution of Eq.(16) further requires (2V1 + V2 )(V1 \u2212 V2 ) = 0 since it\ncan be shown that x1 = x23 is not possible for any hierachy consistent with\nexeperiment.\nIn the minimal A4 model, therefore, only two VEVs of H3 give tribimaximal mixing.\nThe first is\n\n#5\n\n< H3 >= (V, V, V )\n\n(17)\n\nstudied in [6]. But careful comparison with the mass eigenstates reveals that\nm2 \u226b m1 = m3 = 0 so the wrong mass eigenstate (\u03bd2 ) is selected for the\nobserved hierarchy, and so Eq.(17) is an unacceptable VEV for < H3 >.\nThe only other VEV for the A4 -3 is therefore\n#5\n\n#6\n\nThis VEV, < H3 >\u221d (1, 1, 1), can be transformed to < H3 >\u221d (0, 0, 1) by an A4\ntransformation. These possibilities have been called in the literature the Ma-Rajaskaran\nand Altarelli-Feruglio bases respectively.\n#6\nBecause < H3 >\u221d (1, 1, 1) could be made consistent with the neutrino masses in most\nprevious A4 models which had more parameters, the alternative < H3 >\u221d (1, \u22122, 1) seems\nnot to have been previously studied.\n\n6\n\n\f< H3 >= (V, \u22122V, V ),\n\n(18)\n\nwhich also gives tribimaximal mixing and the mass spectrum m3 \u226b m1 = m2\ncorresponding to a normal hierarchy. Thus Eq.(18) provides the only allowed\nVEV for < H3 >.\nAn inverted hierarchy with m1 = m2 \u226b m3 is not possible within a minimal A4 renormalizable model and so is disfavored. This means, for example,\nthat neutrinoless double \u03b2-decay will require higher precision experiments.\nOur conclusion is that the A4 model in a minimal form does favor the normal hierarchy. We have considered a more restrictive model based on A4 than\npreviously considered#7 . The theory has been required to be renormalizable\nand the Higgs scalar content is the minimum possible.\nWe have required that the neutrino mixing matrix be of the tribimaximal\nform. We then find that the masses for the neutrinos are highly constrained\nand can be in a normal, not inverted hierarchy.\nMost, if not all, previous A4 models [2] in the literature permit higherorder irrelevant non-renormalizable operators and their concomitant proliferation of parameters and hence allow a wide variety if possiblities for the\nneutrino masses. We believe the renormalizabilty condition is sensible for\nthese flavor symmetries because of the higher predictivity.\nThe next step, currently under intense investigation, is whether the present\n\u2032\nrenornmalizable A4 model can be extended to a renormalizable T model [7,8].\nIt is necessary but not sufficent condition for this that a successful renormalizable A4 model, as presented here, exists.\nOur principle conclusion is that the constraint of renormalizability which\nis respected by successful theories like QED and QCD gives sharper predictivity to flavor symmetry. For example, in the model discussed in the\npresent Letter, a normal neutrino mass hierarchy is strongly favored over\nan inverted neutrino mass hierarchy. Such a conclusion cannot be reached\nwithout invoking renormalizability as a working principle.\n\n#7\n\nPrevious analysis [2] has included scalars called \"flavons\" which are standard model\nsinglets with vacuum alignments different from those of the present model in which scalars\n\u2032\nH3 (Z2 = +1), H3 (Z2 = \u22121) are electroweak doublets.\n\n7\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported in part by the U.S. Department of Energy under\nGrant No. DE-FG02-06ER41418.\n\nReferences\n[1] E.
