There are many results demonstrating that\nmost of the manifolds obtained by filling inherit properties from the knot manifold. We\nwould also expect the Heegaard structure of filled manifolds to be closely related to\nthe Heegaard structure of the knot manifold. For example, it is easy to see that every\nHeegaard surface for the knot manifold is a Heegaard surface for each filled manifold.\nIn particular, this implies that the Heegaard genus of X is an upper bound on the genus\nof each filled manifold. However, the Heegaard structure of a filled manifold can differ\nfrom that of the knot manifold. Here are four ways that this could occur:\n(1) Heegaard genus decreases.\n(2) A new Heegaard surface is created.\n(3) A non-stabilized Heegaard surface destabilizes.\n(4) Two or more non-isotopic Heegaard surfaces become isotopic.\nPublished: 3 December 2007\n\nDOI: 10.2140/gtm.2007.12.233\n\n\f234\n\nYoav Moriah and Eric Sedgwick\n\nBy a new Heegaard surface, we mean that a filled manifold contains a Heegaard surface\nthat is not isotopic (in the filled manifold) to a Heegaard surface for the knot manifold\nX . When the genus decreases (1), the filled manifold has a Heegaard surface of lower\ngenus than every Heegaard surface for X . Indeed, it is a new Heegaard surface. So,\nrestricting (2) also restricts (1).\nIn each of these cases, we would like to either demonstrate that the set of fillings for\nwhich the phenomenon occurs is special, for example finite, a line of slopes, and/or\nconclude that the Heegaard surface(s) in question are special in some regard, for example\n\u03b3 \u2013primitive, padded, or boundary stabilized.\nIn Section 5 we survey known work that gives quite satisfactory restrictions to phenomena\n(1) and (2). We also give an extended example: Dehn filling on a torus knot exterior,\nfor which we have almost complete knowledge. We are able to completely specify the\nfillings for which each of these four phenomena occur. This also illustrates sufficient\nconditions for (3) and (4) to occur.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Ryan Derby-Talbot, David Bachman, Jesse Johnson and Jennifer\nSchultens for helpful discussions.

Much of the discussion,\nand some of the results quoted, also pertain to manifolds with multiple torus boundary\ncomponents but it will simplify our discussion not to consider them here.\nA slope \u03b1 is the isotopy class of a simple closed curve \u03b1 in the boundary torus \u2202X .\nWith a choice of basis, for example the meridian longitude pair (\u03bc, \u03bb) for a knot exterior\nin S3 , we can naturally identify the set of slopes with Q \u222a {\u221e = 1/0}. It will be\nGeometry & Topology Monographs 12 (2007)\n\n\fThe Heegaard structure of Dehn filled manifolds\n\n235\n\nimportant to be able to identify L\u03b1 , the line of slopes associated with a given slope \u03b1.\nThese are precisely the slopes that meet \u03b1 exactly once: L\u03b1 = {\u03b2 | \u2206(\u03b1, \u03b2) = 1},\nwhere \u2206(\u03b1, \u03b2) indicates the geometric intersection number. We will also construct\na line of lines associated with \u03b1, LL\u03b1 , which is the set of slopes \u03b3 \u2208 L\u03b2 for some\n\u03b2 \u2208 L\u03b1 , that is, LL\u03b1 = {\u03b3 | \u2203\u03b2 s.t. \u2206(\u03b1, \u03b2) = \u2206(\u03b2, \u03b3) = 1}.\n\n2.2\n\nTriviality conditions\n\nWe assume that the reader is familiar with the notions of stabilization, (ir)reducibility,\nand weak reducibility for Heegaard splittings, see Scharlemann [26] for the basics. For\nknot manifolds, it is also worth identifying splittings that are \u03b3 \u2013primitive. They possess\na \"strong\" (A\u03b3 , D) pair: A\u03b3 is a vertical annulus in the compression body with slope\n\u03b3 on \u2202X , and D a disk in the handlebody so that |\u2202A\u03b3 \u2229 \u2202D| = 1. A step down from\nthis are splittings that are weakly \u03b3 \u2013primitive. They possess a \"weak\" (A\u03b3 , D) pair:\na vertical annulus in the compression body with slope \u03b3 and an essential disk in the\nhandlebody that are disjoint. We will introduce several other triviality conditions in later\nsections, identifying splittings that are padded, parallel stabilizations, and boundary\nstabilizations.\n\n2.3\n\nHeegaard structure \u2013 the Heegaard tree and canopy\n\nWhat is meant by the Heegaard structure of a manifold M ? Of course, we include the\nHeegaard genus of M as well as the set of irreducible Heegaard surfaces for M . A bit\nmore general is the Heegaard tree for M , HT M . A vertex in the tree, v\u03a3 , is the class\nof surfaces in M isotopic to a Heegaard surface \u03a3. A directed edge will point from v\u03a3\nto v0\u03a3 if \u03a30 can be obtained from \u03a3 by a single stabilization.\nThe word tree is a bit of a misnomer. For a manifold with fewer than two boundary\ncomponents HT M is indeed a tree. But, a Heegaard splitting M = V \u222a\u03a3 W induces\na partition {\u2202M \u2229 V k \u2202M \u2229 W} of the boundary components. And isotopy and\nstabilization, hence destabilization, cannot change this partition. So HT M actually\nconsists of 2|\u2202M|\u22121 (infinite) components, each a tree as proved by the the ReidemeisterSinger Theorem. The leaves of the tree are precisely the non-stabilized splittings.\nWe also define a somewhat finer variation, the oriented Heegaard tree for M , HT \u00b1\nM,\nwhere the vertices are now defined to be isotopy classes of oriented Heegaard surfaces.\nIn this case we will assume that the compression bodies are ordered 1 and 2 and the\norientation on the Heegaard surface points towards the second compression body. In\nGeometry & Topology Monographs 12 (2007)\n\n\f236\n\nYoav Moriah and Eric Sedgwick\n\nother words, we differentiate between the Heegaard splittings V \u222a\u03a3 W and W \u222a\u03a3 V .\nNote that flipping the orientation of the Heegaard surface swaps the partition of boundary\n|\u2202M| connected trees, double that of\ncomponents. It follows that HT \u00b1\nM will consist of 2\nHT M . For a knot manifold, we can unambiguously define the sign (\u00b1) of an oriented\nHeegaard surface: A positive (+) Heegaard surface will have its orientation pointing\ninto the handlebody, and a negative (\u2212) Heegaard surface will have its orientation\npointing into the compression body.\nWhile this may seem somewhat obvious, it does underline an important difference\nbetween the Heegaard structure of a knot manifold and those obtained by Dehn filling.\nA knot manifold X has connected boundary, so HT \u00b1\nX consists of two components,\n+\n\u2212\nHT X and HT X , each homeomorphic to the tree HT X . But, for a filled manifold\nX(\u03b1), the tree HT \u00b1\nX(\u03b1) is connected. We will say that a surface flips if it is isotopic to\nitself with reverse orientation. This is equivalent to an isotopy that takes the handlebody\nV to the handlebody W for the splitting V \u222a\u03a3 W . In a closed manifold, there is always\na Heegaard surface that flips: Since the oriented Heegaard tree is connected, an oriented\nsurface and its reverse have a common stabilization; this surface flips. It is an easy\nexercise to show that the common stabilization of a Heegaard surface of genus g and its\nreverse has genus at most 2g; hence the smallest genus of surfaces that flip is at most\ntwice the genus of the manifold. But a knot manifold never has a surface that flips,\nbecause a handlebody is never isotopic to a compression body. In other words, for every\nfilled manifold X(\u03b1) there are Heegaard surfaces for X that flip in X(\u03b1) but not in X .\nSince we can stabilize a given splitting any number of times, each tree defined above\nis infinite. Instead of drawing HT \u00b1\nX (upside down!), we will instead draw its canopy,\n\u00b1\nthat is the smallest subset of HT \u00b1\nX that has the same number of components as HT X\nand that contains all of its leaves (non-stabilized splittings). A result of Li [13] shows\nthat the stabilization tree has an infinite canopy only if the manifold contains a closed\nessential surface. Examples of canopies for HT \u00b1\nM are drawn in Section 3.\n\n3\n\nDehn Filling on Torus Knots\n\nIn this section we will review the Heegaard structure of torus knot exteriors and the\nmanifolds that can be obtained by Dehn filling on them. Fortunately there has been a\nlot of work done in this area, and we know the Heegaard tree HT \u00b1\nM up to isotopy for\nall torus knot exteriors and almost all manifolds that can be obtained by Dehn filling on\na torus knot exterior. The sole exception is a restricted class of connected sums of lens\nGeometry & Topology Monographs 12 (2007)\n\n\fThe Heegaard structure of Dehn filled manifolds\n\n237\n\nspaces whose Heegaard structure is known up to homeomorphism but not up to isotopy.\nThese are discussed in Section 3.7.\nFirst, we fix notation. Let T be a Heegaard torus in S3 , it separates S3 into two solid\ntori that we will denote by Vi and Vo . Let \u03bc and \u03bb denote the meridians of Vi and\nVo , respectively. Then the curve Tp,q = p\u03bb + q\u03bc is a (p, q)\u2013torus knot in S3 . The\nexterior, X = S3 \u2212 N(Tp,q ) is a Seifert fibered space over the disk with two exceptional\nfibers fi and fo . A regular neighborhood of fi is the solid torus Vi with a (p, q)\u2013fibering\nby regular fibers and a regular neighborhood of fo is the solid torus Vo with a (q, p)\nfibering by regular fibers (see Scott [32] and Jaco [11]).\n\n3.1\n\nOur examples:\n\nWe will restrict our attention to (p, q)\u2013torus knot exteriors that satisfy two conditions:\n(1) p 6\u2261 \u00b11 (mod q) and q 6\u2261 \u00b11 (mod p)\n(2) q2 6\u2261 \u00b11 (mod p) and p2 6\u2261 \u00b11 (mod q)\nThe first condition rules out torus knot exteriors with fewer than three non-isotopic\ntunnels. This restriction keeps our listing of HT \u00b1\nM 's a bit shorter, but the excluded\nknots can be analyzed in the same manner. The second rules out fillings that produce\na connected sum of lens spaces whose Heegaard structure is known only up to\nhomeomorphism. As mentioned above, this will be discussed further in Section 3.7.\n\n3.2\n\nHeegaard structure of {pair of pants} \u00d7 S1\n\nHeegaard splittings of Seifert fibered spaces with boundary are vertical (see Schultens\n[28]). A vertical splitting is a Heegaard splitting for the Seifert fibered space that is\nalso a Heegaard surface for the product manifold obtained by drilling out all of the\nexceptional fibers. To understand splittings of the torus knot exterior, we look to the\ncorresponding product manifold P \u00d7 S1 , where P is a pair of pants. This manifold\nis also homeomorphic to the exterior of the three component chain in S3 , pictured in\nFigure 1. We have already noted that Heegaard splittings of a manifold with boundary\ninduce partitions of the boundary components. Heegaard splittings of P \u00d7 S1 are special,\nbecause any partition identifies, up to isotopy, a unique irreducible splitting (see [28]).\nWhile the product structure on P \u00d7 S1 is not unique, the Seifert fibering is unique\n(see Jaco [11]). Let Aij denote the unique essential annulus joining \u2202Xi and \u2202Xj , and\nGeometry & Topology Monographs 12 (2007)\n\n\f238\n\nYoav Moriah and Eric Sedgwick\n\n1\n\n3\n\n2\n\nFigure 1: The link manifold X = S3 \u2212 N(chain with 3 components) is homeomorphic to\n{pair of pants} \u00d7 S1 . The arcs a12 and a11 in the pair of pants P.\n\naij = Aij \u2229 P a spanning arc for Aij . A different choice of P will yield a different, but\nhandle slide equivalent, spanning arc aij . Any curve in \u2202Xi which meets a regular fiber\nonce will be referred to as a dual curve. Dual curves determine the possible boundary\nslopes for different choices for P.\nThere are three genus two splittings (six when oriented), each identified by a partition\n+\nof boundary components: \u03a3+\n12 \u2194 {\u2202X1 , \u2202X2 k \u2202X3 }, \u03a313 \u2194 {\u2202X1 , \u2202X3 k \u2202X2 }\n+\nand \u03a323 \u2194 {\u2202X2 , \u2202X3 k \u2202X1 }. The compression bodies corresponding to \u03a3ij \u2194\n{\u2202Xi , \u2202Xj k \u2202Xk } are isotopic to N(\u2202Xi \u222a aij \u222a \u2202Xj ) and N(\u2202Xk \u222a akk ).

In other words, we can isotope a12 \u222a f2 to appear as an eyehook on P, as in the\ncentral picture of Figure 3. Sliding the foot of the circle to \u2202X1 does not change the\nisotopy class of the Heegaard surface and demonstrates that this splitting is equivalent\nto the splitting induced by a11 . We have changed the partition from {\u2202X1 , f2 k \u2202X3 } to\n\u2212\n{\u2202X1 k f2 , \u2202X3 }, demonstrating an isotopy between \u03a3+\n12 and \u03a323 . The isotopy flips f2 ,\nmoving it from one side of the partition to the other. Any fiber with Seifert invariants\n(p, q) so that q \u2261 \u00b11 (mod p) can be flipped. In essence, such fibers should be left out\nof the partition altogether.

Waldhausen [36] showed S3 has a unique non-stabilized Heegaard\nsurface, an S2 splitting S3 into two balls. It is also easy to see that this surface flips.\nEach ball is a regular neighborhood of a point in its interior, and any two neighborhoods\nof points are isotopic in S3 . This defines an isotopy that reverses the orientation of\nthe Heegaard sphere. Therefore the canopy of the oriented Heegaard tree for S3 is as\nsimple as possible: It is a single point.\nS2\nFigure 6: Canopy of HT \u00b1\nis a single point, \u03b1 = 10 .\nS3\n\n3.6\n\nHeegaard structure of L(|r|, sq2 )\n\nA lens space also has a unique non\u2013stabilized Heegaard surface, a torus T (see Bonahon\nand Otal [4]).

Of course, it is possible that two or more of these surfaces\nare isotopic, and that will definitely be the case when a Heegaard torus for one of\nthe summand flips, that is, when q \u2261 \u00b11 (mod p) or p \u2261 \u00b11 (mod q). However,\nEngmann [8] has shown that the connected sum of lens spaces L(p1 , q1 )#L(p2 , q2 ) has\nfour distinct oriented Heegaard surfaces up to homeomorphism, hence isotopy, unless: a)\nq2i \u2261 \u00b11 (mod pi ) for some i, or b) p1 = p2 and q1 q\u22121\n2 \u2261 \u00b11 (mod p1 ). Since p 6= q,\nwe are concerned only with a). In that case, it is clear that the the Heegaard surfaces Ti+\nand Ti\u2212 for L(pi , qi ) are homeomorphic, reducing the number of non-homeomorphic\nsplittings for the connected sum. However, unless some qi \u2261 \u00b11 (mod pi ), it is not\nclear that these splittings are isotopic and we conjecture that they are not.

First, if \u03a3 is a Heegaard surface for any X(\u03b1), then\n\u03a3 must separate X into two components V and W , where W is a handlebody and V is\na punctured handlebody, a handlebody with the neighborhood of a knot removed. Then\n\u03a3 is a Heegaard surface for X(\u03b1) if and only if V(\u03b1) is a handlebody.\nWe can use the results of Culler-Gordon-Luecke-Shalen [7] and Wu [37] to address this\nsituation. To implement their results it is required that \u2202V \u2212 \u2202X is incompressible,\nand we have not assumed that. We can reduce to that situation by first maximally\ncompressing \u03a3 in V to obtain \u03a30 \u2282 V an incompressible surface bounding a punctured\nhandlebody V 0 \u2282 V . If \u03a30 is peripheral, then \u03a3 was itself a Heegaard surface for the\nknot exterior and thus for every filling on X .\nSuppose that \u03a30 is not peripheral and that V 0 contains an incompressible annulus A\u03c3\nwith one boundary component in \u03a3 and the other a curve of slope \u03c3 in \u2202X . If \u03a3\nbounds a handlebody in X(\u03b1) for \u03b1 6= \u03c3 , then \u03a30 compresses in X(\u03b1) and by [7,\nGeometry & Topology Monographs 12 (2007)\n\n\f246\n\nYoav Moriah and Eric Sedgwick\n\nTheorem 2.4.3], \u03b1 \u2208 L\u03c3 and \u03a3 is a Heegaard surface for every \u03b1 \u2208 L\u03c3 . In this case we\nwill call \u03a3 a horizontal Heegaard surface. It is a Heegaard surface for every filling\nX(\u03b1), \u03b1 \u2208 L\u03c3 . By sliding the annulus off the scars from the disk compressions and\nreattaching the disks, we can assume the annulus runs between \u03a3 and \u2202X . For any\nslope \u03b1 \u2208 L\u03c3 , this annulus defines an isotopy of the core of the attached solid torus into\nthe surface \u03a3.\nIf there is no incompressible annulus joining \u03a3 and \u2202X and \u03a3 is a Heegaard surface\nfor X(\u03b11 ) and X(\u03b12 ), then the results of Wu [37] imply that \u2206(\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) = 1. There are\ntherefore at most three fillings for which \u03a3 is a Heegaard surface.\nThis analysis does not solve our problem because we do not have a nice short list\nof candidate \u03a3's to become Heegaard surfaces. It does, however, provide a useful\nframework that is used in various papers on this subject. Let \u03a3 be a Heegaard surface\nfor a manifold X(\u03b1) that is obtained by performing a Dehn filling on a knot manifold X .\nWe regard the core curve \u03b3 of the attached solid torus as a knot in X(\u03b1). The core of\nthe attached solid torus \u03b3 and the Heegaard surface \u03a3 can have one of three possible\nrelationships after performing isotopies in X(\u03b1):\n(C)ore \u03b3 is isotopic into \u03a3 and can be further isotoped so that \u03a3 is a Heegaard surface\nfor the knot exterior X .\n(H)orizontal but not a core \u03b3 is isotopic into \u03a3 but cannot be isotoped so that \u03a3 is\na Heegaard surface for X .\n(N)ot level \u03b3 cannot be isotoped into \u03a3.\nCase C describes an old splitting not a new one. For a new splitting \u03a3, the issue is then\nwhether or not the core of the attached solid torus \u03b3 is isotopic into \u03a3, case H, or not,\ncase N. We would like to limit the set of slopes for which condition H or N occurs.\nCondition N is also referred to as a \"bad\" filling in Rieck\u2013Sedgwick [25].\nWhich of the Heegaard surfaces from the previous section are new, that is, not isotopic\nin the filled manifold to a Heegaard surface for the torus knot exterior? By definition,\nthe vertical splittings are not new as they are also splittings of the knot exterior. Every\nother non-stabilized splitting is new: the Heegaard S2 in S3 , the Heegaard tori in the\nlens spaces, and the horizontal splittings. Each of these has genus different than two\nand therefore cannot be isotopic to a Heegaard surface for the knot exterior, all of which\nare genus two.\nNote that in the filled manifolds, the core of the attached solid torus is not isotopic into\nthe Heegaard surface S2 for S3 , but is isotopic into both the Heegaard tori for the lens\nspaces, and the horizontal splittings, when they occur.\nGeometry & Topology Monographs 12 (2007)\n\n\fThe Heegaard structure of Dehn filled manifolds\n\n4.1\n\n247\n\nN \u2013 The non-level case\n\nNote that when condition N occurs, the core curve \u03b3 has some bridge number b > 0\nwith respect to the Heegaard surface \u03a3. The only filling on a torus knot exterior\nproducing condition N is the 10 \u2013filling which produces S3 . The core \u03b3 is isotopic into\nevery other Heegaard surface (H or C) for every other manifold obtained by filling on the\ntorus knot. Of course, \u03b3 is a torus knot in S3 which has bridge number b = min{p, q}\nwith respect to a sweepout by S2 s (see Schubert [27] and Schultens [31]). Tubing \u03a3\nalong the b upper (or lower) bridges, one builds a Heegaard surface for the knot exterior\nof genus g(\u03a3) + b. Tubing corresponds to stabilization in the filled manifold, but the\nresulting surface may or may not be a stabilized Heegaard surface for the knot manifold.\nFor torus knots, this process yields a Heegaard surface of genus b for the knot exterior,\nwhich is irreducible only when its genus is minimal, that is, when b = 2. Such torus\nknots have p = 2 or q = 2 and are excluded for consideration here by the first condition\nin Section 3.1.\n\n4.2\n\nH \u2013 The horizontal case, parallel and boundary stabilization\n\nIn case H, we can assume that \u03b3 \u2282 \u03a3 in the filled manifold X(\u03b1). The surface\n\u03a3\u2217 = \u03a3 \u2212 N(\u03b3) is a surface with boundary properly embedded in the knot exterior X .\nMoreover, since \u03b3 is isotopic into the surface, the meridional slope \u03b1 intersects the\nslope \u03c3 of the surface \u03a3\u2217 precisely once. The surface \u03a3\u2217 has two boundary components\nand splits X into two handlebodies. Such a surface is referred to as an almost Heegaard\nsurface in Rieck\u2013Sedgwick [25]. As noted, \u03a3 is a Heegaard surface for every manifold\nX(\u03b10 ) where \u03b10 \u2208 L\u03c3 , where \u03c3 is the slope of \u03a3\u2217 . These manifolds differ by Dehn\ntwists in the curve \u03b3 in the Heegaard surface \u03a3 .\nThe lens space fillings on the torus knot exterior are a simple example: \u03a3 is the Heegaard\ntorus, \u03a3\u2217 is the cabling annulus and its slope is \u03c3 = pq\n1 . Moreover, \u03a3 is a Heegaard\nsurface for the entire line Lpq/1 of lens space fillings. The collection of Seifert fibered\nmanifolds possessing horizontal splittings are another example, this time occurring\nwith filling coefficients L0/1 . Note that while most of these splittings are irreducible,\nthere are a few cases where they reduce ( 10 \u2208 Lpq/1 and 10 , 11 \u2208 L0/1 ). It is a theorem of\nCasson and Gordon [5] that if \u03a3\u2217 is incompressible then the distance between weakly\nreducible fillings on the line is at most 6. See the appendix of Moriah\u2013Schultens [17]\nfor a proof. For horizontal splittings of Seifert fibered spaces, there are at most two\nfillings on the line that result in weakly reducible Heegaard splittings (see Sedgwick\n[33]).\nGeometry & Topology Monographs 12 (2007)\n\n\f248\n\nYoav Moriah and Eric Sedgwick\n\nWe can also use \u03a3 to form a Heegaard surface for the knot exterior of genus g(\u03a3) + 1\nby a process we will call parallel stabilization: Push the surface \u03a3 to one side of the\nknot, say below, see Figure 13. Now, \u03a3 and \u2202X cobound an annulus A. Surgering \u03a3\nalong A yields \u03a3\u2217 , hence A and \u03a3\u2217 have the same boundary slope on \u2202X . Let a be\na spanning arc for A. We can perform parallel stabilization on \u03a3 by tubing around\n\u03b3 and then attaching the tube to \u03a3 by a tube around a. To be more formal, note that\nthe surface \u2202N(\u03a3 \u222a a \u222a \u03b3), (neighborhood taken in X(\u03b1)) has two components. The\nparallel stabilization is the component that has one higher genus than \u03a3. It is a Heegaard\nsurface for the knot exterior X . Note that we can parallel stabilize \u03a3 in two ways, by\nstarting with \u03a3 either above or below \u03b3 . These surfaces are not in general isotopic in\nX , but they are in the filled manifold X(\u03b1), because there they are both stabilizations of\nthe same surface \u03a3. It is not hard to check that parallel stabilization does not depend\non the choice of annulus, even for annuli with different slopes.\n\na\n\nFigure 13: Parallel stabilization of a horizonal surface\n\nLet A\u03b1 be the meridional annulus, A\u03c3 be the longitudinal annulus, and D the disk\nthat appear in Figure 14. The annuli A\u03c3 and A\u03b1 meet in a single arc, A\u03c3 \u2229 D = \u2205\nand A\u03b1 \u2229 D = {pt}. Together, A\u03b1 and D demonstrate that the parallel stabilization\nis \u03b3 \u2013primitive, for \u03b3 = \u03b1. But, \u03b1 is not unique in this regard. By twisting in A\u03c3 we\ncan construct an A\u03b10 meeting D once for any \u03b10 \u2208 L\u03c3 . The existence of the triple\n(A\u03b1 , A\u03c3 , D) with the specified intersections is equivalent to the Heegaard splitting being\na parallel stabilization.\nThere is an isotopic picture of the parallel stabilization that will be very useful in\nSection 6.2. See Figure 15. Shrink the disk D so that it is small, and then flatten the top\nsurface. This makes the knot boundary \u2202X appear to be below the surface, and the hole\ndefined by D now appears to be a tube below the surface. It is also easy to see A\u03b1 as a\nonce punctured disk that meets the disk D once. The annulus A\u03c3 runs between the knot\nand the surface above it.\nIf \u03a3 was a Heegaard surface for the knot exterior, and not just a horizontal surface,\nGeometry & Topology Monographs 12 (2007)\n\n\f249\n\nThe Heegaard structure of Dehn filled manifolds\n\nD\nD\n\nFigure 14: The disk D and annuli A\u03b1 and A\u03c3 in a parallel stabilization\n\nFigure 15: Surfaces that are isotopic to the parallel stabilization. First make the disk D small,\nand then flatten the top. This forces the hole to appear as a tube below the surface.\n\nthen we will call the parallel stabilization of \u03a3 a boundary stabilization. In this case\nit can also be viewed as an amalgamation of \u03a3 with a type (ii) splitting of product\nneighborhood of \u2202X , see Moriah [15]. Since \u03a3 cobounds annuli of every slope with\n\u2202X , and parallel stabilization doesn't depend on this choice, a boundary stabilization is\n\u03b3 \u2013primitive for every slope on L\u03c3 for every \u03c3 . In other words, a boundary stabilization\nis \u03b3 \u2013primitive for every slope \u03b3 .\nAn examination of Figure 4 makes it clear that the inner and outer tunnel systems of the\ntorus knot exterior are parallel stabilizations of parallel copies of, just above and below,\nthe standard torus in which Tp,q is embedded. However, the middle splitting is not a\nparallel stabilization because it is not \u03b3 \u2013primitive for any \u03b3 when it is not isotopic to\neither the inner or outer splitting, that is, for p 6\u2261 \u00b11 (mod q) and q 6\u2261 \u00b11 (mod p)\n[19].\nWhen a parallel stabilization is minimal genus then it is clearly irreducible. This is\nthe case with the inner and outer splittings of the torus knot exterior. But this need\nnot be the case. In fact, when filling a torus knot exterior, if the filled manifold has an\nirreducible horizontal Heegaard splitting \u03a3, then its parallel stabilization is reducible.\nGeometry & Topology Monographs 12 (2007)\n\n\f250\n\nYoav Moriah and Eric Sedgwick\n\nIts parallel stabilization \u03a30 is a splitting of the knot manifold, a Seifert fibered space\nwith boundary. As already noted it is proved by Schultens [28] that such splittings are\nvertical and irreducible only when they are minimal genus. But if p > 3 then the genus\nof \u03a30 is 2(p \u2212 1)(q \u2212 1) + 1 > 3, strictly greater than two, the genus of the knot exterior.\n\n5\n\nNew Heegaard surfaces \u2013 the results\n\nWe now survey results that restrict (N) and (H).\n\n5.1\n\nMoriah and Rubinstein\n\nIn order to prove the existence of knots with super-additive tunnel number, Moriah and\nRubinstein [16] needed to show that there are fillings on a knot exterior for which the\nHeegaard genus does not drop at all. If the genus does drop, then the filled manifold\nhas a Heegaard surface of genus lower than that of every Heegaard surface for the knot\nexterior, that is, the filled manifold possesses a new Heegaard surface.\nIn fact, they conclude that there is a finite list of candidates of bounded genus for all\nbut a finite number of fillings, and the genus does not degenerate for \"most\" fillings,\nas is demonstrated by the following theorem and corollary. Their theorem applies to\nmanifolds with multiple torus boundary components. Here we have restated it only for\nknot\u2013manifolds and in terms consistent with our discussion:\nTheorem 5.1 (Moriah and Rubinstein \u2013 rephrased) Let X be hyperbolic knot\u2013\nmanifold and g a positive integer. Then there is finite set of slopes NX and a collection\nof Heegaard and horizontal surfaces \u03a31 , . . . , \u03a3k \u2282 X , so that if \u03b1 6\u2208 NX then any\nHeegaard splitting of X(\u03b1) of genus less than or equal to g is isotopic to one of the \u03a3i .\nTheir theorem implies several things for Heegaard surfaces of bounded genus, in\nparticular minimal genus, in hyperbolic knot\u2013manifolds. Condition N occurs for at\nmost finitely many slopes, those in NX . Away from this finite number of slopes, the\ncore is isotopic into every Heegaard surface of bounded genus. And, H occurs for all\nslopes on a finite (possibly empty) set of lines L\u03b21 , . . . , L\u03b2k , k \u2265 0.\nBy avoiding a finite set of slopes for N and a finite set of lines for H, every Heegaard\nsurface of bounded genus for the filled manifold is isotopic to a Heegaard surface for the\nknot exterior. In particular, the Heegaard genus of these manifolds is the same as that of\nthe knot exterior. Of course, if the genus decreases and we are not in situation N, then\nGeometry & Topology Monographs 12 (2007)\n\n\fThe Heegaard structure of Dehn filled manifolds\n\n251\n\nthe discussion on the horizontal case H (Section 4.2) shows that the genus decreases by\nat most one.\nA corollary of their theorem is:\nCorollary 5.2 (Moriah and Rubinstein) Let X be a hyperbolic knot\u2013manifold. Then\nthere exists a finite set of slopes NX and a finite set of lines HX so that:\n(1) \u03b1 \u2208\n/ NX \u222a HX =\u21d2 g(X(\u03b1)) = g(X)\n(2) \u03b1 \u2208\n/ NX =\u21d2 g(X(\u03b1)) \u2265 g(X) \u2212 1.\nwhere g denotes the Heegaard genus of the manifold.\nThis theorem forbids new Heegaard splittings of bounded genus for most filled manifolds,\nbut leaves open that possibility for new Heegaard surfaces when we do not bound genus.\nThat is, as we increase the bound g the sets of slopes for conditions N and H could grow\nin an unbounded fashion. In fact, as discussed in Section 5.3, this does not happen.\n\n5.2\n\nRieck\n\nRieck [22] took a topological approach to the same problem and computed numeric\nbounds on the distance between \"bad\", that is, type N, fillings. Suppose that N occurs\nwith respect to Heegaard surfaces \u03a31 \u2282 X(\u03b11 ) and \u03a32 \u2282 X(\u03b12 ). Since the core is\nnot isotopic into either \u03a31 \u2282 X(\u03b11 ) or \u03a32 \u2282 X(\u03b12 ), it can be put into non-trivial thin\nposition with respect to sweepouts by each surface. Furthermore, thick level surfaces for\neach sweepout, when regarded as punctured surfaces in the knot exterior, will intersect\nessentially. This approach yields a bound on the distance between the slopes \u03b11 and\n\u03b12 :\nTheorem 5.3 (Rieck \u2013 rephrased) Let X be an anannular knot manifold. Suppose that\nthe core of the attached solid torus is not isotopic into Heegaard surfaces \u03a31 \u2282 X(\u03b11 )\nand \u03a32 \u2282 X(\u03b12 ). Then \u2206(\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) < 18g1 g2 + 18g1 + 18g2 + 18, where g1 and g2\nare the genera of \u03a31 and \u03a32 , respectively.\nIn [23], Rieck examines the relationship between Dehn filling and Heegaard structure\nfrom a different viewpoint. He asks which manifolds possess a genus reducing knot, a\nknot for which infinitely many surgeries decrease Heegaard genus. He answers this\nquestion for all totally orientable Seifert fibered spaces other than those with base space\nS2 and three or fewer exceptional fibers. Almost all of the considered Seifert fibered\nspaces do contain contain genus reducing knots, the exception being Seifert fibered\nspaces possessing a horizontal Heegaard surface of one of two special types.\nGeometry & Topology Monographs 12 (2007)\n\n\f252\n\n5.3\n\nYoav Moriah and Eric Sedgwick\n\nRieck and Sedgwick\n\nCondition H is explored further in Rieck and Segwick [25]. As we have already noted,\nin that case we can form the surface \u03a3\u2217 = \u03a3 \u2212 N(\u03b3), a properly embedded surface in\nthe knot\u2013manifold X .\nTheorem 5.4 (Rieck and Sedgwick) Suppose that the core of the attached solid torus\nis isotopic into \u03a3 a Heegaard surface for a filled manifold X(\u03b1). Then one of the\nfollowing holds:\n(1) \u03a3 is a Heegaard surface for X (perhaps after an isotopy in X(\u03b1), or,\n(2) the slope of the almost Heegaard surface \u03a3\u2217 is the boundary slope of a separating\nessential surface of genus less than or equal to that of \u03a3\u2217 .\nIf the second conclusion occurs, then the slope \u03b1 is one that intersects the slope of an\nessential surface exactly once. Hatcher has shown such slopes to be finite in number\n[10], so if H occurs we know that the slope \u03b1 belongs to one of a finite number of lines\ndefined by slopes of essential surfaces. This improves the earlier work of Moriah and\nRubinstein because the knot\u2013manifold is not required to be hyperbolic, it applies to all\nsurfaces without a bound on genus, and a connection is made between these slopes and\nthe slopes of essential surfaces.\nIt would be nice if the surface \u03a3\u2217 were itself an essential surface. However, the method\nof proof is similar to that of Casson and Gordon [6] and may require that \u03a3\u2217 is modified\nby compressions and annulus swaps to obtain an essential surface.\nIn their second paper [24] Rieck and Sedgwick continued their investigation into the\nHeegaard structure of filled manifolds. We can assume that the knot\u2013manifold X is\ngiven via a one-vertex triangulation, see Jaco and Sedgwick [12, Theorem 3.2]. They\nthen prove (slightly rephrased):\nTheorem 5.5 (Rieck and Sedgwick) Let T be a one-vertex triangulation of the\nknot\u2013manifold X . If \u03b3 , the core of the attached solid torus, is not isotopic in X(\u03b1) into\na Heegaard surface \u03a3, then the slope \u03b1 is either the slope of a boundary edge of the\ntriangulation or the slope of a normal or almost normal slope in (X, T ).\nThe proof of the theorem follows Thompson's proof [35] that a triangulation of S3\ncontains an almost normal S2 . The 1\u2013skeleton of the triangulation is put in thin position\nwith respect to a sweepout given by the Heegaard surface \u03a3. If a boundary edge is\nisotopic into the Heegaard surface, we either have an edge with slope \u03b1 or the core \u03b3\nGeometry & Topology Monographs 12 (2007)\n\n\fThe Heegaard structure of Dehn filled manifolds\n\n253\n\nis isotopic into \u03a3. Otherwise, we are able to find a non-trivial thick level, yielding a\nnormal or almost normal surface with slope \u03b1 in \u03a3. Bachman [1] has a similar result.\nThey then apply a theorem of Jaco and Sedgwick [12] stating that there are only finitely\nmany slopes bounding normal and almost normal surfaces in such a triangulation.\nTheorem 5.6 (Jaco and Sedgwick) Let X be a knot-manifold with a triangulation T\nthat restricts to a one\u2013vertex triangulation on \u2202X . Then there are only a finite number of\nslopes realized as the slopes of embedded normal and almost normal surfaces in (X, T ).\nThe proof is an analog of Hatcher's proof [10] that there are a finite number of slopes\nbounding essential surfaces in a knot\u2013manifold. It is shown that normal or almost normal\nsurfaces that are compatible, meaning that their normal sum is well defined, must have\nthe same slope or their sum produces trivial curves in the boundary. Whereas Hatcher's\ntheorem relies on Floyd and Oertel's work with branched surfaces [9], this proof appeals\nto similar properties of normal and almost normal surfaces in a triangulation.\nCorollary 5.7 (Rieck and Sedgwick, rephrased) Let X be a knot\u2013manifold. Then\nthere exists a finite set of slopes NX in \u2202X so that if \u03b1 \u2208\n/ NX , then the core of the\nattached solid torus \u03b3 is isotopic into every Heegaard surface for X(\u03b1).\nNote that this theorem does not require a bound on genus and applies to non-hyperbolic\nas well as hyperbolic knot exteriors.\n\n5.4\n\nSummary of known results\n\nFor clarity, we offer a summary of the known results. Recall the trichotomy offered at\nthe start of this section. The core of the attached solid torus \u03b3 is either (N)ot Level,\n(H)orizontal but not a core, or a (C)ore of a given Heegaard surface \u03a3.\nTheorem 5.8 Let X be a knot\u2013manifold. Then there is a finite set of slopes NX and a\nfinite set of lines HX so that:\n(1) If \u03b1 \u2208\n/ NX , then the core of the attached solid torus is isotopic into every Heegaard\nsurface for X(\u03b1), and in particular g(X) \u2212 1 \u2264 g(X(\u03b1)) \u2264 g(X), and,\n(2) If \u03b1 \u2208\n/ NX \u222a HX then X(\u03b1) does not contain a new Heegaard surface, that is,\nevery Heegaard surface for X(\u03b1) is isotopic (in X(\u03b1)) to a Heegaard for X , and\nin particular g(X(\u03b1)) = g(X).\nRemark For fillings on any torus knot exterior we can take NX = { 10 } and HX =\n{Lpq/1 \u222a L0/1 }.\n\nGeometry & Topology Monographs 12 (2007)\n\n\f254\n\n6\n\nYoav Moriah and Eric Sedgwick\n\nWhat is not known?\n\nWhile we have answered many of the questions regarding the Heegaard structure of\nfilled manifolds, there are at least several that remain.\n\n6.1\n\nDestabilization\n\nQuestion 6.1 Let \u03a3 be a non-stabilized Heegaard surface for X . What can be said\nabout the set of the fillings for which \u03a3 destabilizes?\nWhen filling a torus knot exterior the inner, outer and middle splittings necessarily\ndestabilize when the obtained manifold is a lens space or S3 , that is, for the fillings on\nthe line Lpq/1 .\nThis is evident in the fact that each of these splitting is padded. A Heegaard surface \u03a3\nis said to be padded if there exists a triple (P, A\u03c3 , D) where:\n(1) P is a punctured disk in the compression body, (a punctured disk is a planar\nsurface in a compression body that has one boundary component, its \"boundary\",\nin the Heegaard surface and all others, the \"punctures\", in \u2202X )\n(2) A\u03c3 is a vertical annulus in the compression body with slope \u03c3 on \u2202X .\n(3) D is a disk in the handlebody,\n(4) |\u2202P \u2229 \u2202D| = 1\n(5) |\u2202A\u03c3 \u2229 \u2202D| = 0.\nCondition (5) clearly implies that padded splittings are weakly \u03c3 \u2013primitive. But in\nfact, it is much stronger: For a strongly irreducible Heegaard surface the results of\nCuller\u2013Gordon\u2013Luecke\u2013Shalen [7] and Wu [37] imply that \u03c3 meets the slope of the\npunctures once. Twisting P in the annulus A\u03c3 yields a destabilizing pair (P\u03b1 , D) for\nevery slope \u03b1 \u2208 L\u03c3 .\nWe have observed that the inner and outer splittings \u03a3i and \u03a3o are parallel stabilizations.\nThis is a very strong form of padded where the punctured disk P is actually an annulus\n(take P = A\u03b1 , A\u03c3 = A\u03c3 , D = D). The middle splitting \u03a3m is also padded where\n\u03c3 = pq\n1 , but it is slightly harder to see. The handlebody component of X \u2212 \u03a3m is a\nregular neighborhood of the union of the critical fibers joined by a spanning arc aio for\nthe annulus Aio running between them, that is, N(fi \u222a aio \u222a fo ). The arc aio punctures\nthe cabling annulus A once so we may think of the compression body as a product\nGeometry & Topology Monographs 12 (2007)\n\n\fThe Heegaard structure of Dehn filled manifolds\n\n255\n\nT 0 \u00d7 [\u22121, 1] \u2212 N(Tp,q ), where T 0 is a copy of T with a single puncture. Take D to be\nthe meridional disk for the inner solid torus, A \u2282 V as the vertical annulus Tp,q \u00d7 [0, 1]\nwith slope pq\n1 and boundary towards the outside solid torus, and P = {a} \u00d7 I \u2212 N(Tp,q ),\nwhere a is any arc properly embedded in T 0 that meets \u2202D exactly once.\nIt may be surprising to realize that there is a non-stabilized Heegaard splitting that\ndestabilizes for every filling. As noted in Section 4, a boundary stabilization is \u03b3 \u2013\nprimitive for every \u03b3 so it necessarily destabilizes for every filling. Hence the question\nbecomes: Can a boundary stabilized Heegaard splitting be non-stabilized in the knotmanifold? Yes, as is shown in Sedgwick [34] and Moriah\u2013Segwick [18]. Let \u03a3ij be one\nof the genus two splittings for {pair of pants} \u00d7 S1 discussed in Section 3.2. Then the\nannuli Aik and Ajk are annuli that we can use to parallel stabilize (boundary stabilize,\nsince we start with a Heegaard surface). In each case, we obtain the genus three splitting\n\u03a3123 which is identified by the partition of boundary components {\u2202X1 , \u2202X2 , \u2202X3 k \u2205}.\nIt is induced by the pair of arcs a12 \u222a a23 (or a12 \u222a a13 or a13 \u222a a23 ). There are also\nexamples of boundary stabilized but non-stabilized Heegaard splittings for manifolds\nwith two boundary components [18]. The question remains open for knot-manifolds.\nIn general, we expect to be able to say little about a Heegaard splitting that destabilizes\nfor a finite number of fillings. But what if it destabilizes for infinite number of fillings?\nThe above examples demonstrate that padded splittings destabilize for infinitely many\nfillings and a boundary stabilization destabilizes for all fillings. We conjecture the\nconverses:\nConjecture 6.2 Suppose that a non-stabilized Heegaard surface destabilizes for\ninfinitely many fillings. Then it is padded.\nConjecture 6.3 Suppose that an irreducible Heegaard surface destabilizes for all\nfillings. Then it is a boundary stabilization.\nIt might appear that Theorem 5.8 would answer the questions raised in this section.\nBut Theorem 5.8 only restricts the set of slopes for which a given Heegaard surface\ndestabilizes to a new Heegaard surface. But, it is possible for a non-stabilized Heegaard\nsurface to destabilize in the filled manifold where it becomes isotopic to another\nHeegaard surface for the knot exterior. For example, a boundary stabilization of a\nHeegaard surface \u03a3 destabilizes in every filling, and the destabilized surface is isotopic\nto \u03a3.\nBut, more importantly, Theorem 5.8 doesn't say anything about the structure of the\nsurface destabilizing, even if it is of minimal genus: Let \u03a3 be a minimal genus Heegaard\nGeometry & Topology Monographs 12 (2007)\n\n\f256\n\nYoav Moriah and Eric Sedgwick\n\nsurface for X that destabilizes in infinitely many fillings, in particular in some filled\nmanifold X(\u03b1) where \u03b1 \u2208\n/ NX . Then \u03a3 destabilizes to a Heegaard surface \u03a30 for X(\u03b1)\nand the core of the attached solid torus is isotopic into \u03a30 . We can construct \u03a300 , a\nparallel stabilization of \u03a30 , that is a Heegaard surface for X of the same genus as that of\n\u03a3. The parallel stabilization \u03a300 destabilizes in X(\u03b1), as well as in an infinite number\nof other filled manifolds. But we don't know that \u03a3 and \u03a300 are the same surface in X ,\nall we know is that they become isotopic in X(\u03b1).\nIn fact, the above situation is not vacuous. The middle splitting of the (p, q)\u2013torus knot\nexterior is padded but not a parallel stabilization. (A parallel stabilization is \u03b3 \u2013primitive\nfor all slopes meeting the slope of the annulus A once, but the middle splitting is not\n\u03b3 \u2013primitive for any \u03b3 as proved in Moriah\u2013Sedgwick [19].) Not only does it destabilize\nfor fillings on the line Lpq/1 , it also becomes isotopic to the inner and outer splittings\nfor fillings on the same line.\n\n6.2\n\nIsotopic Surfaces\n\nThe above discussion leads us to our next question:\nQuestion 6.4 Suppose that \u03a31 and \u03a32 are non-isotopic Heegaard surfaces for X . In\nwhich fillings do \u03a31 and \u03a32 become isotopic?\nThis question is also of interest if we wish to understand what happens to the oriented\nHeegaard tree HX\u00b1 after filling. We know that some vertices are identified in every filled\nmanifold.\n\nFigure 16: An annulus swap on a horizontal surface\n\nAn annulus swap is a procedure that allows us to find, in the knot-manifold, surfaces\nthat become isotopic after filling. See Figure 16. Suppose that \u03a3 is a horizontal surface\nin X , so that there is an annulus A\u03c3 with one boundary component in \u03a3 and another a\nnon-trivial curve of slope \u03c3 in \u2202X . Then \u2202N(\u03a3 \u222a A\u03c3 \u222a \u2202X), where the neighborhood\nis taken in X , consists of two surfaces, one isotopic in the neighborhood to \u03a3 and the\nother not, call it \u03a30 . Then we say that \u03a30 is obtained from \u03a3 by an annulus swap along\nA\u03c3 . There is an annulus A0\u03c3 running from \u03a30 to \u2202X , also with slope \u03c3 , that we can\nGeometry & Topology Monographs 12 (2007)\n\n\fThe Heegaard structure of Dehn filled manifolds\n\n257\n\nuse to reverse the operation, obtaining \u03a3 from \u03a30 by swapping \u03a30 along A0\u03c3 . More\nimportantly, after filling along any slope \u03b1 \u2208 L\u03c3 the surfaces \u03a3 and \u03a30 co\u2013bound a\nproduct, \u03a3 \u00d7 I , and are therefore isotopic in X(\u03b1). We will say that \u03a3 and \u03a30 are\n\u03c3 \u2013swap equivalent if \u03a30 can be obtained from \u03a3 by a swap along an annulus A\u03c3 with\nslope \u03c3 . They are swap equivalent if they are \u03c3 \u2013swap equivalent for some \u03c3 . And, we\nwill say that \u03a3 and \u03a30 are weakly swap equivalent if there is a sequence of swaps (with\nno restriction on slopes) taking \u03a3 to \u03a30 .\nDistinct Heegaard surfaces can be swap equivalent. For example, the dual tunnels of\nMorimoto and Sakuma [20] are 10 \u2013swap equivalent. The following lemma shows that\nthis only happens under specific circumstances:\nLemma 6.5 Suppose that \u03a3 is a Heegaard surface for X . Then \u03a3 is \u03b3 \u2013swap equivalent\nto a Heegaard surface \u03a30 for X if and only if \u03a3 is \u03b3 \u2013primitive.\nProof Let V \u222a\u03a3 W and V 0 \u222a\u03a30 W 0 be the decompositions induced by \u03a3 and \u03a30 , where\nW and W 0 are handlebodies and V and V 0 are the components containing \u2202X . We\nknow that V is a compression body and must decide when V 0 is as well.\nLet N be a regular neighborhood, N = N(A\u03b3 \u222a \u2202X), taken in V . Its boundary \u2202N\nconsists of two 2\u2013tori T1 \u222a T2 , one of which, say T2 , is \u2202X . The torus T1 is composed\nof two annuli T1 = AV \u222a A\u03a3 where A\u03a3 \u2282 \u03a3 is a regular neighborhood in \u03a3 of the\ncurve component of \u2202A\u03b3 \\ \u2202X and AV = T1 \\ A\u03a3 is properly embedded in V .\nWe obtain V 0 by gluing N to W along A\u03a3 , that is, V 0 = W \u222aA\u03a3 N . Since, N is a\nhomeomorphic to a product, 2\u2013torus \u00d7 I , the component V 0 is a compression body if\nand only if there is an essential disk D \u2282 W that meets A\u03a3 in a single essential arc.\nThis occurs if and only if D meets the boundary of the annulus A\u03b3 in a single point,\nthat is, \u03a3 is \u03b3 \u2013primitive.\nIt follows that if the Heegaard surfaces \u03a3 and \u03a30 are swap equivalent but one of them\nis not \u03b3 \u2013primitive for some \u03b3 , then the sequence of swaps must have length at least\ntwo. This still places restrictions on \u03a3 and \u03a30 as detailed in the following lemma. Note\nthat \u03a3 is not assumed to be a Heegaard surface, although if it is swap equivalent to a\nHeegaard surface, it must be a horizonal surface.\nLemma 6.6 Suppose that we can perform two distinct annulus swaps on \u03a3. Swapping\nalong A\u03c31 yields \u03a31 , and swapping along A\u03c32 produces \u03a32 , where A\u03c31 and A\u03c32 are\nnot isotopic. If either \u03a31 or \u03a32 is a Heegaard surface, then \u03a31 is weakly \u03c31 \u2013primitive\nand \u03a32 is weakly \u03c32 \u2013primitive.\nGeometry & Topology Monographs 12 (2007)\n\n\f258\n\nYoav Moriah and Eric Sedgwick\n\nProof Isotope A\u03c31 and A\u03c32 to intersect minimally. It follows that neither has inessential\narcs of intersection with endpoints in \u2202X . We claim that we can find essential disks D1\nand D2 (possibly the same) that compress \u03a3 towards \u2202X and whose boundaries are\ndisjoint from A\u03c31 and A\u03c32 , respectively. This would prove the lemma.\nIf A\u03c31 \u2229 A\u03c32 contains an inessential arc, then it is inessential in both annuli, and its\nendpoints are on \u03a3. An outermost inessential arc on A\u03c32 bounds a disk in A\u03c32 and a\ndisk in A\u03c31 . The union of these disks is a disk D1 that is essential (minimality) and\ndisjoint from A\u03c31 . A symmetric argument yields a disk D2 disjoint from A\u03c32 . We\ncan therefore assume that the annuli meet only in essential arcs, so they are cut into\nrectangles.\nIf \u03c31 and \u03c32 do not have the same slope, then we can form a collection of disks that are\nshaped like a box without a top, each disjoint from both annuli. The four sides of the\nbox are the sub-rectangles of the annuli and the bottom of a box is a rectangle in \u2202X .\nFurthermore, it is not possible for all of our boxes to be inessential disks, this would\nimply that \u03a3 is peripheral in X and, in turn, show that X is a solid torus, not a proper\nknot\u2013manifold.\nIf \u03c31 and \u03c32 do have the same slope then the annuli are disjoint. In that case, we\nwork in some X(\u03b1), \u03b1 \u2208 L\u03c31 . Then the annulus A = A\u03c31 \u222a A\u03c32 \u2282 X(\u03b1) is a properly\nembedded annulus in a handlebody (\u03a31 is a Heegaard surface). It can't be peripheral as\nthis would imply that A\u03c31 and A\u03c32 are isotopic in X . So, it boundary compresses to a\ndisk D that is essential and disjoint from both A\u03c31 and A\u03c32 .\nSuppose that \u03a3 and \u03a30 are equivalent after a sequence of swaps of length n, but not\nfor a sequence of shorter length: \u03a3 = \u03a30 \u2194 \u03a31 \u2194 * * * \u2194 \u03a3n = \u03a30 . If n = 1 \u03a3 and\n\u03a30 are both \u03b3 \u2013primitive, hence weakly \u03b3 \u2013primitive, for some \u03b3 . If n > 1, then the\nprevious lemma can be applied with \u03a3 = \u03a31 (and \u03a3 = \u03a3n\u22121 ) to show that they are\nboth weakly \u03b3 \u2013primitive. It follows that only weakly \u03b3 \u2013primitive Heegaard surfaces\nare swap equivalent to other Heegaard surfaces.\nCorollary 6.7 Suppose that \u03a3 and \u03a30 are swap equivalent Heegaard surfaces. Then\neach is weakly \u03b3 \u2013primitive for some \u03b3 .\nIt is particularly interesting to see what happens when we perform a swap along a\nparallel stabilization. This case is covered by the following lemma:\nLemma 6.8 Let \u03a3 and \u03a30 be horizontal surfaces that are related by a swap along an\nannulus with slope \u03c3 . Then the parallel stabilizations of \u03a3 and \u03a30 are swap-equivalent\nfor every slope \u03b1 \u2208 L\u03c3 .\nGeometry & Topology Monographs 12 (2007)\n\n\fThe Heegaard structure of Dehn filled manifolds\n\n259\n\nFigure 17: Parallel stabilizations that are swap equivalent along meridional annuli\n\nProof Choose a swap annulus A\u03b1 for the parallel stabilization of \u03a3 where \u03b1 \u2208 L\u03c3 .\nFigure 17 indicates the situation in X(\u03b1), where A\u03b1 appears to be meridional. The\nparallel stabilization on the left and the surface on the right are swap equivalent along\nthe meridional annuli pictured. It is easier to see the swap from right to left. In that\ncase the swap just tubes the surface towards and then along the knot, yielding the\nsurface and dual annulus on the left. But the surface on the right hand side is isotopic\nto an upside\u2013down copy of the surface in Figure 15. Thus, the right hand surface is a\nparallel stabilization of \u03a30 , the surface obtained if we had swapped \u03a3 before parallel\nstabilizing.\nRecall that if two surfaces are swap equivalent for some slope \u03c3 , then the surfaces are\nisotopic in X(\u03b1) for every \u03b1 \u2208 L\u03c3 .\nCorollary 6.9 Let \u03a3 and \u03a30 be horizontal surfaces that are related by a swap along an\nannulus with slope \u03c3 . Then the parallel stabilizations of \u03a3 and \u03a30 are isotopic in X(\u03b1)\nfor every \u03b1 \u2208 LL\u03c3 .\nRemark Since the isotopy passes through the (filled) knot, it changes the sign of an\noriented surface (see Section 2.3).\nA parallel stabilization can also be swapped along the annulus with slope \u03c3 . The proof\nof the following lemma is just the observation that a parallel stabilization, see Figure 13,\nis just a regular stabilization followed by an annulus swap along the slope \u03c3 .\nLemma 6.10 Suppose that \u03a3 is a horizontal surface with annulus A\u03c3 running from \u03a3\nto \u2202X . Then the parallel stabilization of \u03a3 is isotopic to a stabilization of \u03a3 in X(\u03b1)\nfor any \u03b1 \u2208 L\u03c3 .\nGeometry & Topology Monographs 12 (2007)\n\n\f260\n\nYoav Moriah and Eric Sedgwick\n\nRemark If the horizonal surface is not a Heegaard surface, then its stabilization is also\na horizontal surface that is not a Heegaard surface. (Stabilization and destabilization do\nnot convert a Heegaard to a non-Heegaard surface.)\nWe now return our focus to the fillings on the (p, q)\u2013torus knot exterior and show that\nannulus swaps explain when any pair of genus two Heegaard surfaces for the knot\nexterior become isotopic. (We will continue to restrict the class of torus knots as in\nSection 3.1).\nThe inner and outer splittings become isotopic, but remain distinct from the middle\nsplitting, in fillings on the line of lines LLpq/1 . This is explained by the lemma and\ncorollary above. First note that the Heegaard tori Ti = \u2202N(fi ) and To = \u2202N(fo ) are\nhorizontal surfaces that are swap equivalent via an annulus with slope pq\n1 , hence they\nare isotopic in the lens space fillings on the line Lpq/1 . The isotopy takes Ti\u00b1 to To\u2213\nand vice-versa. Since the Heegaard surfaces \u03a3i and \u03a3o are their respective parallel\nstabilizations, they are isotopic for all slopes \u03b2 \u2208 LLpq/1 by Corollary 6.9. As oriented\n\u2213\nsurfaces, this isotopy takes \u03a3\u00b1\ni to \u03a3o , and changes the partition in X from {fi , \u2202X k fo }\nto {fi k \u2202X, fo }.\n\u03a3+\ni\n\nS(Ti )\u2212\n\n\u03a3+\nm\n\nS(To )\u2212\n\n\u03a3+\no\n\n\u03a3\u2212\no\n\nS(To )+\n\n\u03a3\u2212\nm\n\nS(Ti )+\n\n\u03a3\u2212\ni\n\nFigure 18: Genus two surfaces that are equivalent via swaps along annuli with slope\nsurfaces are all isotopic in the lens spaces X(\u03b1) where \u03b1 \u2208 Lpq/1 .\n\npq\n1 .\n\nThese\n\nAll three genus two Heegaard surfaces become isotopic along the line Lpq/1 of lens\n+\nspace fillings. Lemma 6.10 shows that the inner and outer surfaces \u03a3+\ni and \u03a3o become\nisotopic to stabilizations of the horizontal inner and outer Heegaard tori S(Ti\u2212 ) and\nS(To\u2212 ), respectively. Note that while S(Ti\u2212 ) and S(To\u2212 ) are not Heegaard surfaces, they\nare pq\n1 \u2013primitive. The handlebody for the middle splitting \u03a3m is a regular neighborhood\nof the union of the exceptional fibers fi and fo joined by a spanning arc for the annulus\nAio running between them. So we can find two annuli from \u2202X to \u03a3m , each with slope\npq\n1 . One runs between \u2202X and Ti , the other between \u2202X and To . Swapping along these\n\u2212\n\u2212\nannuli changes \u03a3+\nm to the stabilized horizontal surfaces S(Ti ) and S(To ), respectively.\nThese observations yield the swap diagram in Figure 18, all using annuli with slope pq\n1 .\nIn particular, it explains how all three surfaces flip in the lens spaces. We suspect that\nthis swap diagram is complete.\nGeometry & Topology Monographs 12 (2007)\n\n\fThe Heegaard structure of Dehn filled manifolds\n\n261\n\nAnnulus swaps explain every post\u2013filling isotopy of Heegaard surfaces for the torus\nknot exteriors we consider. This leads to several questions:\nQuestion 6.11 Suppose that two Heegaard surfaces for a knot-manifold become\nisotopic after infinitely many fillings. Are they equivalent via annulus swaps?\nIf so, then Lemma 6.6 would imply that the answers to the following is also \"yes\":\nQuestion 6.12 Suppose that two Heegaard surfaces for a knot-manifold become\nisotopic after infinitely many fillings.
