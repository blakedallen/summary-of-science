Simon et al., PRL 91, 046803 (2003)] for the evolution of \u03bd = 1 bilayer quantum Hall system with distance, are obliterated. Our conclusion is based on\na careful analysis of the momentum distribution in \u03bd = 21 single-layer composite- fermion state. We\npoint out to a possibility of the phenomenon hitherto unknown outside Kondo lattice systems when,\nin a translationally invariant system, Fermi-liquid-like portion of electrons enlarges its volume.\n\n] The nature and physics of the transition in the bilayer \u03bd = 1 quantum Hall (QH) system [1] between the wellestablished phases: one characteristic for the distances between the layers of the order of or smaller than magnetic\nlength, sometimes described as \"111\" state, and the other for larger distances, described by two separate Fermiliquid-like states of composite fermions (CFs) attracted recently the attention of experimentalists [2] and is the focus\nof several theoretical papers [3, 4, 5, 6]. Only references [4] and [5] make a prediction for a coexistence region between\ntwo phases, with a unique property, semicircle law for the longitudinal and Hall drag resistance that was revealed\nin the experiments [2]. The reference [5] introduces a form of the ground state of the system that may continously\ninterpolate between the 111 state, usually described by composite bosons (CBs), and the two seperate Fermi-liquidlike states of CFs. The ground state proved to be a good variational ansatz when compared with the exact solution in\nnumerical studies [5]. The form of the variational state for certain distance between the layers may be described as one\nin which classically speaking some of the electrons are in the 111 state (they make CBs) and the others participate\nin two Fermi seas of CFs. Gradually the number of CFs increases as the distance becomes larger. Therefore the\ndescription easily accounts for the continous nature of the transition as observed in the experiments [2]. On the other\nhand the proposal that came first, based on a phase separated picture, [4], in which percolating puddles of one phase\nare in the other, well enough exibits the transport properties measured in the experiments. The advantage of the\nhomogenous model ([5]), which accounts for the same transport properties, is that it also accounts for the strong 111\n(interlayer) correlations that occur even deep in the CF region [2].\nHere we study the Fermi surface singularities in the proposed wave functions [5]. Naively they are expected at the\nFermi momenta directly related to the number of CFs in the particular partition of the overall number of electrons\ninto CFs and CBs. The analysis begins with a careful study of the \u03bd = 12 CF problem, so that the relationships\nfound can be readily applied to the mixed state case. We found that the CF momentum distribution near the naively\nexpected Fermi momenta depend analytically on the distance to the Fermi momenta, therefore showing no signature\nof the Fermi surfaces.\nSoon after Halperin, Lee, and Read [7] proposed their theory for \u03bd = 12 fractional QH effect Bares and Wen [8]\nconsidered fermions in low dimensions interacting via a long range \u2212 |~2\u03c0\nq|2 interaction. They used as a good ansatz for\nthe ground state, a wave function of the Feenberg-Jastrow type,\nY\n|xi \u2212 xj |m \u03a8F S ({x}),\n(1)\n\u03a8o ({x}) =\ni<j\n\nwhere \u03a8F S denotes a Slater determinant of filled Fermi sea of free single-particle states. If m = 2 this construction\nis the Rezayi-Read [9] ground state, in the representation of CFs and when the projection to the lowest Landau level\n(LLL) is neglected, found to correctly captures the physics at \u03bd = 12 . By doing a calculation of a random phase\napproximation (RPA) type on (1) Bares and Wen found that the leading singularity of the momentum distribution\nnear kF , in two dimensions, is\n\u03b4nk \u2248\n\nm o\n{n ln |\u03b4k| \u2212 (1 \u2212 nok ) ln |\u03b4k|},\n2 k\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b4k = |~k| \u2212 kF and nok denotes the free-Fermi-gas momentum distribution. They also remarked that if we\ninterpret the rhs of (2) as the first term in an expansion in powers of m we can write (near kF )\nnk =\n\nm\nm\n1 1 o\n+ {nk |k \u2212 kF | 2 \u2212 (1 \u2212 nok )|k \u2212 kF | 2 }.\n2 2\n\n(3)\n\n\f2\n\n=\n\n+\n\n....\n\n+\nFIG. 1: Effective screened interaction\n\nWhat they did not emphasize is that if m = 2 and although we have a Luttinger-liquid type of expansion near kF\n[10] there is no nonanalytic behavior due to the odd power of |k \u2212 kF | and all trace of the Fermi surface has been\neliminated.\nWe can come to the same expressions employing the weakly-screening plasma analogy [11], which in considering\nquantum-mechanical expectations in the state, Eq.(1), mimics Laughlin's plasma approach [12]. In the Laughlin\napproach there is the perfect screening of the classical Coulomb plasma, when interaction \u2212 |2\u03c0\nbecomes screened as\n~\nk|2\n\u2212 |~2\u03c0\nk|2\n1+\n\n2\u03c0\u03b2m2\nso (k)\n|~\nk|2\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\n1\n2\nwhere m is from \u03bd = m\n, filling factor; \u03b2 = m\nis the plasma inverse temperature, and so (k) is the static structure factor\nof the noninteracting particles, in this case bosons, so that so (k) = \u03c1 - particle density, and hence a perfect screening.\nMore precisely it can be found [13] that the expansion in small m of classical statistic averages (to which quantum\nexpectations correspond) is well defined, gives the results that can be found by other methods, and allows continuation\nto larger than m = 1 values. In this context the screening is captured by the accustomed infinite summation of a\ngeometric series described by Eq.(4) and symbolically can be represented by the sum of diagrams as in Fig. 1\nIn the case of the weakly-screening plasma analogy due to the presence of the free-fermion Slater determinant in (1),\nthe first summation, (4), that is done while organizing diagrams, gets modified, having for so (k) the static structure\nfactor of free fermion gas, which in two dimensions for small k can be found to be sfo (k) = 34 k\u03c0F2 k. This leads to not\nso perfect screening of the long-range interaction which becomes as 1r instead of ln r in real space. The approach\nintroduced parallels the RPA calculation in Ref. [8] in getting (2) when Fig. 1 corresponds to an RPA summation\nwith the value of the bubble equal to sfo (k)\u03b2m2 .\nWe want to see in more detail how the equal-time CF propagator can be found, and, possibly, which additional\ndiagrams in its calculation would lead to the conjectured expression for the CF occupation number. It is instructive\nto first consider how we can get the equal-time CB correlator i.e. Girvin - MacDonald correlations [14] in the Laughlin\ncase using the diagramatic expansion [13]. As introduced by Girvin and MacDonald we in fact in the plasma language\nhave to deal with two impurities of charge m\n2 each, which do not interact directly. Therefore we have\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nGB (z, z ) \u223c |z \u2212 z |\n\n\u2212m\n2\n\nZ(z, z )\n,\nZ(z, z)\n\n(5)\n\n\u2032\n\n2\nwhere Z(z, z ) is the partition function of the classical 2D plasma with inverse temperature \u03b2 = m\n, each particle\n\u2032\nm\nwith charge m, as before, and two impurities with charge 2 each at the locations z and z . (Z(z, z) is the partition\nfunction with one impurity of charge m at an arbitrary location because the value of the partition function does not\ndepend on z.) What we expect is that the ratio will have the following form,\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\nZ(z, z )\n= exp{\u2212\u03b2\u2206f (z, z )},\nZ(z, z)\n\n(6)\n\n\u2032\n\nwhere \u2206f (z, z ) represents the difference in the free energy between the two configurations. Indeed we can find doing\nthe simple expansion in m that the term right after the first term (of value one) is\nm\nVef f (|z \u2212 z |) = ( )2\n2\n\u2032\n\nZ\n\n\u2212 |2\u03c0\n~\n\u2032\nd2 k\nk|2\n~\nexp{ik(~r \u2212 ~r )}\n,\n2\n2\n2\u03c0\u03b2m\n(2\u03c0)\n1+ ~ 2 \u03c1\n\n(7)\n\n|k|\n\n1\n), which represents an effective screened interaction between two impurities and extract to mimic (6),\n(\u03c1 = 2\u03c0m\n\u2032\ncontributions of disconnected Vef f (|z \u2212 z |) parts that follow so that for the final expression we get\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\nZ(z, z )\n= exp{Vef f (|z \u2212 z |)}.\nZ(z, z)\n\n(8)\n\n\f3\n\n+\n\n+ ...\n\n+\n\n=\nFIG. 2: Effective diagram contribution\n\u2032\n\nTherefore we can conclude that in calculating GB (z, z ) we have to exponentiate the value of the diagram shown in\nFig. 2, and get, due to the screening, the famous algebraic decay.\nSimilarly, applying the same type of approximation we can get in the CF case\nZ\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nd2 k 2\u03c0\u03b2\n2\u03c0\u03b2\nm\n(\n\u2212\n) exp{i~k(~r \u2212 ~r )},\n(9)\nGF (z, z ) \u223c GoF (z, z ) exp{( )2\nf\n2\n2\n~\n2\n(2\u03c0)2 |~k|2\n|k| + 2\u03c0\u03b2m so (k)\n\u2032\n\nwhere (the screening bubble is proportional to the static structure factor of free fermions and) GoF (z, z ) =\n\u2032\nP\ni~\nk(~\nr \u2212~\nr )\nis the equal-time correlator of free Fermi gas. To fix the normalization we demand that the to|~\nk|<kF e\ntal number of CFs is the same as of noninteracting particles so that\nX Z\nX Z\n~\n~\nd2 r GoF (~r) e\u2212ik~r = N =\nd2 r GF (~r) e\u2212ik~r ,\n(10)\n~\nk\n\n~\nk\n\nand GoF (0) = GF (0) follows. Therefore\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nGF (z, z ) = GoF (z, z ) exp{(\nAnd indeed by taking nk =\nexponential in (11) we get\n\nR\n\nm\n\u03b4nk = ( )2\n2\n\nZ\n\nm 2\n)\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u2032\nd2 k 2\u03c0\u03b2\n2\u03c0\u03b2\n(\n\u2212\n)[exp{i~k(~r \u2212 ~r )} \u2212 1]}.\nf\n2\n(2\u03c0) |~k|2\n|~k|2 + 2\u03c0\u03b2m2 so (k)\n\n(11)\n\n~\n\ne\u2212ik~r GF (~r) and considering the first nontrivial contribution in the expansion of the\nd2 q 2\u03c0\u03b2\n2\u03c0\u03b2\n( 2 \u2212\n)[n~ok\u2212~q(1 \u2212 nok ) \u2212 nok (1 \u2212 n~ok\u2212~q )],\nf\n2\n2\n(2\u03c0)2 |~\nq|\n|~q| + 2\u03c0\u03b2m so (q)\n\n(12)\n\nexactly the same expression as Eq.(86) of Ref. [8]. Once we specify that k is near kF , assume a flat Fermi surface\nand neglect the contribution of the (weakly) screened interaction in (12) we can get, as in [8], the leading singularity\nin nk given by Eq.(2).\nBut unfortunately after a suitable regrouping of free-Fermi-gas occupation numbers we can prove that the second\nnontrivial contribution in the expansion of the exponential (with the neglect of the screened interaction) is equal to\nzero. That does not mean that the conjectured contribution (Eq.(3)) is absent. Here we have very likely the situation\nthat due to the nonanlytic nature of the attempted expansion in the CF case we can not generate corrections to\nthe terms linear in m. That conclusion supports also the finding [13] that when the same expansion was applied\nin the calculation of the static structure factor of the CF state a first correction to the RPA result could not be\ngenerated although it was expected on the grounds that the correction would have made the infered LLL-projected\nstatic structure factor positive definite what by its definition it should be.\nTherefore, very likely the exponential prescription (used to get Eq.(3)) is a valid one although there is no straightforward expansion to prove it. Once we accept the prescription we are left to wonder where is the expected nonan1 m\nalyticity at \u03bd = m\n, 2 = odd integer (see Eq.(3) for that case). A trace of the real Fermi-surface nonanalyticity at\nm\n=\nodd\ninteger\nmay\nbe seen in the expansion only if we take into account the screened interaction (second part) in\n2\nEq.(12). As an effective contribution from this part we have\n\u03b4nk =\n\n1\n[|\u03b4k| ln |\u03b4k| no (k) \u2212 (1 \u2212 no (k)) |\u03b4k| ln |\u03b4k|],\n2\u03c0mso\n\n(13)\n\n\f4\nwhere so = 34 k\u03c0F2 . If we apply the exponential prescription again, taking also into account this second contribution,\n1\n\u2261 c and, for m\nwe have, with 2\u03c0ms\n2 = 1, for the contribution in the vicinity of kF ,\no\nnk =\n\n1 1\n+ [|\u03b4k| exp{c|\u03b4k| ln |\u03b4k|} no (k) \u2212 (1 \u2212 no (k))|\u03b4k| exp{c|\u03b4k| ln |\u03b4k|}].\n2 2\n\n(14)\n\nHere a (weak) nonanalyticity is retained. Namely, in Eq.(14) we have singular (at kF ) the second derivative of\n1 m\n|\u03b4k| exp{c|\u03b4k| ln |\u03b4k|} with respect to |\u03b4k|. Therefore, a trace of the Fermi surface at \u03bd = m\n, 2 = 1, is present because\nof the found nonanalytic behavior. (Such a behavior exists also for m\n=\nodd\n>\n1\nbut\nis\nweaker\nhaving singular higher\n2\nderivatives.)\nIn the following we will give an example where aforementioned mechanism for getting the Fermi surface (nonanalyticity) does not work due to strong correlations of the CFs with other particles of the system. This is the case of\nthe mixed CB - CF quantum Hall states proposed in [5] to describe the evolution of the bilayer \u03bd = 1 QH system\nwith distance between layers.\nIf we neglect the LLL projection again and assume that for our purposes we can also neglect the overall antisymmetrization between CB and CF parts that makes the mixed state completely antisymmetric and an electronic wave\nfunction, we can write it in the quasiparticle representation as\n\u03a8o (z\u2191 , z\u2193 , w\u2191 , w\u2193 ) =\nQ\nQ\nn\nn\nn\n|z\n\u2212\nz\nj\u2191 |\np<q |zp\u2191 \u2212 zq\u2193 |\nk<l |zk\u2193 \u2212 zl\u2193 |\ni<j i\u2191\nQ\nQ\nQ\nQ\nn\nn\nn\nn\nr,s |zr\u2193 \u2212 ws\u2193 |\np,q |zp\u2193 \u2212 wq\u2191 |\nk,l |zk\u2191 \u2212 wl\u2193 |\ni,j |zi\u2191 \u2212 wj\u2191 |\nQ\nQ\nm\nm\nk<l |wk\u2193 \u2212 wl\u2193 | \u03a8F S ({w\u2193 }),\ni<j |wi\u2191 \u2212 wj\u2191 | \u03a8F S ({w\u2191 })\nQ\n\n(15)\n\nwhere z\u2191 and z\u2193 denote CB coordinates and w\u2191 and w\u2193 denote CF coordinates with arrows specifying to which layer\nquasiparticles belong. The total numbers of bosons are equal as well the total numbers of fermions, and n = m\n2 =\nodd integer.\nWe want to find out (the asymptotic behavior of ) the equal-time correlator of a CF (belonging to one of the layers).\nIt is not \u2032hard to conclude that in this case with assumptions similar to the ones done in the single-layer case, we get\nGF (w, w ) by simply taking for the value of the \"polarization\" bubble \u03b2m2 sfo (k) + \u03b2n2 \u03c1b ,\n\n(16)\n\nf\ninstead of \u03b2m2 sfo (k)\np only in Eq.(11), where \u03c1b denotes the total (up plus down) density of bosons and in so (k) we\nhave to take kF = 4\u03c0\u03c1f where \u03c1f is the density of fermions of one layer only. In this case we work with a completely\nscreened interaction between the two impurities which does not produce nonanalytic contributions.\n2\nTherefore we find that at the total fillings of bilayer at which we can expect bose-fermi mixed states, \u03bd = m\n; m=\n2, 6, . . . the naively expected Fermi surface(s) can not exist due to our analysis. This outcome remind us of the\nsimilar disappearance of the small (naively) expected Fermi momentum in the Kondo lattice systems [15, 16] due to\nthe Luttinger theorem [17]. In the case considered in the paper we do not know for sure if we deal with (overall)\nFermi-liquid-like states and a complete analogy (in which CBs and CFs play the roles of of localized spin 1/2 local\nmoments and conduction electrons respectively) is still missing. Further insights into the physics of the mixed states\nare necessary.\nThe author thanks Ashvin Vishwanath for asking the question discussed in the paper, and Aspen Center for Physics\nfor its hospitality.
