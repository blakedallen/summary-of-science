Our results on the\ncross section and spin density matrix elements (SDME) are in fair agreement with\nDESY experiments. The predicted double spin longitudinal ALL asymmetry is not\nsmall at HERMES energies.\n\nThis report is devoted to the study of the vector meson leptoproduction at large\nenergies and small x-Bjorken (x) based on our results [1]. In this kinematic region the\nprocess factorizes [2] into a hard meson leptoproduction off gluons and GPD (Fig.1).\nThe cross section for longitudinally polarized virtual\nq\nphotons which dominate for asymptotically large photon\nq =q \u0001\nvirtualities exceeds the data by a large factor at small x if\ncalculated in the collinear approximation [3]. Moreover,\nin this approximation the amplitudes for transversally\nk = k\u0016 \u00012\nk = k\u0016 + \u00012\npolarized photons exhibit infrared singularities [4] which\nsignal the breakdown of factorization. Nevertheless the\nknowledge of these amplitudes is necessary to study spin\np = p\u0016 + \u00012\neffects in the vector meson production. Really, the anal- p = p\u0016 \u00012\nysis of SDME for light vector mesons, measured by H1 [5]\n\u2217\nand ZEUS [6], reveals that both the \u03b3\u22a5\n\u2192 V\u22a5 (TT) and Figure 1. The handbag diagram\n\u2217\n\u03b3\u22a5 \u2192 VL (TL) transition amplitudes are non-negligible for the meson electroproduction\nin the kinematic region accessible by the DESY experi- off proton.\nments. It has been shown by us [7] that in the modified\nperturbative approach (MPA) [8] which includes the quark transverse degrees of freedom\naccompanied by Sudakov suppressions, one can solve both these problems. Reasonable\nagreement with H1 and ZEUS data [5, 6] has been obtained for electroproduced \u03c1 and \u03c6\nmesons at small x [1, 7].\nIn this report, we discuss the spin effects in the vector meson leptoproduction. Within\nthe MPA the amplitudes for the three transitions LL, T T and T L can be calculated and\nafterwards cross sections and SDME. Note that the leading-twist wave function describes\nthe longitudinally polarized vector mesons and cannot be applied to the transversally\npolarized light mesons. To study this case, we use the higher order k- dependent wave\nfunction proposed in [9]\nThe gluon contribution to the leptoproduction amplitudes for t \u223c 0 and positive\nproton helicity reads as a convolution of the hard subprocess amplitude HV and a large\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n\fdistance gluon GPD H g (Fig.1) :\nM\u03bc\u2032 +,\u03bc+ =\n\u00d7\n+\n\ne\nCV\n2\n\nnh\nh\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n0\n\ndx\n(x + \u03be)(x \u2212 \u03be + i\u03b5)\ni\n\nH\u03bcV\u2032 +,\u03bc+ + H\u03bcV\u2032 \u2212,\u03bc\u2212 H g (x, \u03be, t)\ni\n\nfg (x, \u03be, t)\nH\u03bcV\u2032 +,\u03bc+ \u2212 H\u03bcV\u2032 \u2212,\u03bc\u2212 H\n\no\n\n.\n\n(1)\n\nHere \u03bc (\u03bc\u2032 ) denotes the helicity of the photon (meson), x is the momentum fraction of the\ntransversally polarized gluons\n\u221a and the skewness \u03be is related to Bjorken-xg by \u03be \u2243 x/2.

The polarized GPD H\ng\nthan the GPD H at small x and will be important in the ALL asymmetry only.\nThe subprocess amplitude HV is represented as the contraction of the hard part F ,\nwhich is calculated perturbatively, and the non-perturbative meson wave function \u03c6V\nH\u03bcV\u2032 +,\u03bc+\n\n\u00b1\n\nH\u03bcV\u2032 \u2212,\u03bc\u2212\n\nZ\n2\u03c0\u03b1s (\u03bcR ) Z 1\nd 2 k\u22a5\n2\nd\u03c4\n= \u221a\n) F\u03bc\u00b1\u2032 \u03bc .\n\u03c6V \u03bc\u2032 (\u03c4, k\u22a5\n16\u03c0 3\n0\n2Nc\n\n(2)\n\nThe wave function is chosen in Gaussian form\n\u03c6V (k\u22a5 , \u03c4 ) = 8\u03c0\n\n2\n\nq\n\n2Nc fV a2V\n\nexp\n\n\"\n\n\u2212a2V\n\n#\n\nk\u22a52\n.\n\u03c4 \u03c4\u0304\n\n(3)\n\nHere \u03c4 (\u03c4\u0304 = 1\u2212\u03c4 ) is the fraction of the meson momentum carried by the quark (antiquark),\nfV is the decay coupling constant and the aV parameter determines the value of average\ntransverse momentum of the quark in the vector meson. Generally, values of fV , aV may\nbe different for the TT and LL amplitudes.\n2\nThe subprocess amplitude is calculated within the MPA [8] where we keep the k\u22a5\nterms in denominators of the amplitudes and numerator of the TT amplitude. The\ngluonic corrections are treated in the form of the Sudakov factors which additionally\nsuppress the end-point integration regions. The model leads to the following hierarchy of\nthe amplitudes\n\u221a\n\u2212t\nk2\u22a5\nV (g)\nV (g)\nV (g)\nLL : M0 \u03bd,0 \u03bd \u221d 1 ;\nTL : M0 \u03bd,+\u03bd \u221d\n;\nTT : M+\u03bd,+\u03bd \u221d\n.\n(4)\nQ\nQMV\nThe other transitions are small and neglected in our analysis. Here MV is the scale\nwhich appears in the higher order wave function for transversely polarized meson and,\nrespectively, in the T T amplitude [1]. The MV should be about the meson mass mV .\nThe GPD is complicated function which depends on three variables. For the small\nmomentum transfer t \u223c 0 we can use the double distribution form proposed in [10]\ng\n\nh\n\nH (x, \u03be, t) = \u0398(0 \u2264 x \u2264 \u03be)\n\nZ\n\nx+\u03be\n1+\u03be\nx\u2212\u03be\n1+\u03be\n\nd\u03b2 + \u0398(\u03be \u2264 x \u2264 1)\n\nZ\n\nx+\u03be\n1+\u03be\nx\u2212\u03be\n1\u2212\u03be\n\nd\u03b2\n\ni\n\n\u03b2\nx\u2212\u03b2\nf (\u03b2, \u03b1 =\n, t) (5)\n\u03be\n\u03be\n\nwith the simple factorizing ansatz for the double distributions f (\u03b2, \u03b1, t)\nf (\u03b2, \u03b1, t \u2243 0) = g(\u03b2)\n2\n\n3 [(1 \u2212 |\u03b2|)2 \u2212 \u03b12 ]\n.\n4\n(1 \u2212 |\u03b2|)3\n\n(6)\n\n\fIn this model, we calculate GPD [1] through the gluon distribution g(\u03b2) and take the\nCTEQ5M results [11] for it . Unfortunately, in the low x region the gluon distribution\nhas an error which can exceed 15%. This will cause large uncertainty in the calculated\ncross sections.\nThe t- dependence of the amplitudes is important in analyses of experimental data.\nFor simplicity we parameterize it in the exponential form Mii (t) = Mii (0) et Bii /2 for\nLL, T T, T L transitions. Experimentally, only the slope of the \u03b3 \u2217 p \u2192 V p cross section\nis measured whereas information about individual slopes Bii is absent. We suppose that\nBLL \u223c BT L but BT T can not be equal to BLL . In the integrated cross section only the\nfV\nfollowing combination |MT T |2 \u221d ( MTV )2 BT1 T appears. Thus, by the corresponding choice\nof parameters we can obtain the same cross sections for a different BT T slope. We test\ntwo different scenarios for the \u03c1 production which will be discussed here.\n1. BT T \u223c BLL /2; MV = mV ; f\u03c1T = .250 GeV; a\u03c1T = 0.65 GeV\u22121 .\n2. BT T \u223c BLL ; MV = mV /2; f\u03c1T = .170 GeV; a\u03c1T = 0.65 GeV\u22121 .\nThis will result in the same integrated over t cross section. Differences can be found only\nin observables with the interference between different helicity amplitudes (SDME e.g.).\nFor LL transition we use f\u03c1L = .216 GeV, a\u03c1L = 0.522 GeV\u22121 .\n10\nH1\n\n3\n\n8\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\nR(\u03c1)\n\nZEUS\n\n6\n4\n\n*\n\n\u03c3(\u03b3 p->\u03c1 p) [nb]\n\n10\n\n2\n10\n\n0\n\n0\n5\n\n10\n2\n2\nQ [GeV ]\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8 10\n2\n\n20\n\n40\n\n2\n\nQ [GeV ]\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 2a.

The asymmetry is shown in Fig.4 together with the uncertainties\nin our predictions due to the error in the polarized gluon distribution. Note that for the\n\u03c1 production the polarized quark GPD should be essential in the ALL asymmetry.\nIn summary: Light vector meson electroproduction at small x was analyzed here\nwithin the GPD approach. The amplitudes were calculated using the MPA with the\nwave function dependent on the transverse quark momentum. By including the higher\n2\norder k\u22a5\n/Q2 effects in the denominators of hard subprocess (2) we regularize the endpoint singularities in the amplitudes with transversally polarized photons. It was pointed\nout that the diffraction peak slopes of the T T and T L amplitudes are not well defined.\nHowever, within scenarios 1 and 2 we can get the same accurate description of the Q2\n4\n\n\fdependence of the cross section, R ratio and SDME for the \u03c1 meson production. Our\nresults for the \u03c6 production can be found in [1]. Some comparison with the two-gluon\nexchange model [12] known as ln(1/x) approximation can be found in [1] too.\nThe knowledge of the BT T and BT L slopes is essential in analyses of the momentum\ntransfer dependence of the SDME. We found reasonable results for SDME in the GPD\nmodel for both the scenarios. This means that now we have two possibilities for the tdependence of the scattering amplitudes with similar and different BLL and BT T slopes\nwhich agree with existing experimental data. Unfortunately, the data on spin observables\nhave large experimental errors. This does not permit one to determine which model is\nrelevant to experiment. To clarify situation, additional theoretical study of the momentum\ndependence of the LL, T T and T L transition amplitudes is needed. An experimental\ninvestigation to reduce errors in SDME is extremely important.\nThus, we can conclude that the vector meson photoproduction at small x is a good\ntool to probe the gluon GPD. Study of the t dependence of SDME can give important information on the structure of different helicity amplitudes in the vector meson production.\nThis work is supported in part by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research, Grant\n03-02-16816 and by the Heisenberg-Landau program.\n\nReferences\n[1] S.V.
