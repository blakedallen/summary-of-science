However, the arbitrary consideration of additional scalar fields (which may even have\nnon-conventional kinetic terms inserted by hand) should\nbe constrained by the fact these extra scalars to be neutral under all the standard model symmetries, and thus\nnot introducing additional fifth forces. This non-trivial\nrequirement led many authors to the alternative direction\nof modifying gravity itself [6], with a promising attempt\nin these lines being perhaps the recent developments in\nHo\u0159ava-Lifshitz gravity [7], a power-counting renormalizable, Ultra-Violet (UV) complete gravitational theory\n(although there may well be problems with the theory\ndue to additional degrees of freedom becoming strongly\ncoupled in the Infra-Red).\nOn the other hand, constructions arising from string\ntheory are hard to result in dark energy phenomenology consistent with observations, purely using the closed\nstring sector. For more details see the review [8]. However, cosmological dynamics driven by the open string\nsector through dynamical Dp-branes, which is the basic\nidea of the so-called Dirac Born Infeld (DBI) formalism,\nhas led to interesting successes, mainly in inflationary\nparadigms [9, 10, 11]. After inflation the universe lives\non branes that wrap various cycles within the compact\nspace, and in this sense the GUT or Electro-Weak phase\ntransition can be manifested through a geometric fashion. Thus, dark energy does present a dynamical nature,\nretaining additionally a form of geometric origin. Quan-\n\ntitatively, the tight constraints from WMAP 5 year data\nset [12] on the model parameters have led DBI-models\nto more complex versions, including multiple fields [13],\nmultiple branes [14, 15, 16], wrapped branes [17] or monodromies [18]. Finally, the phase-space analysis of a solitary D3-brane moving through a particular warped compactification of type IIB was done [19], while the generalization to multiple and partially wrapped branes has\nbeen performed in [20].\nIn the present work we are interested in constructing\na DBI-scenario based on Ghost D-branes, that is Dpbranes that have a Z2 symmetry acting to flip the signs\nof the N S-N S and RR sectors. Such a consideration is\nmore robust than the naive and ambiguous use of the\nprototypical non-BPS D3-brane action, albeit with the\nwrong sign kinetic term. In addition, although in a typical flux compactification of type II string theory down to\nfour-dimensions one must introduce negative tension objects called Orientifolds (in order to cancel the D3-brane\ncharge associated with the closed string fluxes, and to\nproject out various string states breaking half of the bulk\nsupersymmetry so that the vacuum retains an N = 1\nstructure), the existence of Ghost branes could possibly\nnegate the need for Orientifolds. As we show, in such a\nghost D-brane scenario we can naturally acquire an effective dark energy behaving either as quintessence or as\nphantom.\nThe plan of the work is as follows: In section II we\npresent the formalism of Dp-branes, used in dark energy scenarios. In section III we extend it, introducing\nthe concept of ghost D-branes, and we extract the darkenergy equation-of-state parameter. In section IV we investigate its general features, examining the conditions\nfor the appearance of quintessence or phantom behavior,\nwhile in section V we perform an explicit phase-space\nanalysis of the static, dark-energy dominated, solution\nsub-class. Finally, our results are summarized in section\nVI.\nII.\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: msaridak@phys.uoa.gr\naddress: jwa@uvic.ca\n\nDp-BRANE ACTION\n\nThe open string sector of type II string theory is usually governed by the DBI action, governing the low en-\n\n\f2\nergy fluctuations of such strings attached to a Dp-brane.\nFor N coincident branes, the world-volume symmetry is\nenhanced from U (1) to U (N ), and the scalar fluctuations\nare then promoted to matrices obeying a Lie structure.\nThis is similar to the induced non-commutative worldvolume theory on a single Dp-brane when we turn on a\nnon-trivial B-field.\nString scattering calculations indicate that there is a\n\nS = \u2212Tp\n\nZ\n\np+1\n\nd\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\nq\nq\nX\n\u2212\u03c6\ni\n\u22121\nij\n\u2212det(P[Eab + Eai (Q \u2212 \u03b4) Ejb + \u03bbFab )]) detQj \u00b1 \u03bcp STrP[ei\u03bbi\u03c6 i\u03c6\nC(n) eB ]e\u03bbF ,\n\u03beSTr e\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\n\u03bb = 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\nEab = Gab + Bab\nQij = \u03b4ji + i\u03bb[\u03c8 i , \u03c8 k ]Ekj .\n\n(2)\n\nIn the expressions above, \u03bb is the inverse of the F -string\ntension, and \u03b1\u2032 is the square of the string-length - the\nfundamental length scale in our theory. The scalar \u03c8 i is\nrelated the space-time embedding X i = \u03bb\u03c8 i and finally\nB (2) is the N S-N S gauge potential, which we will ignore\nin the following. Moreover P denotes the pullback operator acting on the bulk space-time tensor fields, and \u03c8 i\nare the scalar field fluctuations where i = (p + 1) . . . 9.\nIn the RR-sector we see the introduction of the interior\nderivative i\u03c8 , whose action on an n-form is\ni\u03c8 i\u03c8 C (n) =\n\n1 i j (n)\n[\u03c8 , \u03c8 ]Cji .\n2\n\n(3)\n\nThe presence of the interior rather than exterior derivative allows the Dp-brane to couple to gauge potentials\nof higher order, such as the (p + 3), (p + 5) forms. This\nsuggests that there is a transmutation (or dielectric) effect where the Dp-brane can blow up into a D(p + 2)brane through higher order terms in the expansion of the\nChern-Simons action [22, 24]. A concrete example of this\neffect is when N D3-branes blow up into a solitary D5brane via the formation of a fuzzy S 2 , more commonly\nreferred to as the Myers effect. If the scalar fields transform under an appropriate representation of a higher dimensional gauge group, then the D3-branes can be polarized into higher dimensional branes in an analogous\nfashion through the extended Myers effect [22, 25]1 . For\nexample, if the scalars transform under irreducible representations of the n-fold tensor product of SO(5), then the\n\n1\n\nparticular trace prescription required in order to account\nfor the full string cross-section, which is given by the\nsymmetrized average over all possible orderings of the\nLie-algebra valued objects [21]. Much like the single Dpbrane action, one can sum the relevant terms into nonlinear form (although only valid up to O(\u03b1\u2032 )3 ) to partially\nreconstruct the non-Abelian theory using the effective\naction [22, 23]:\n\nAlthough there exists a different action, proposed by Tseytlin\n[26], which does not admit such an effect.\n\nbranes orient themselves along a fuzzy S 4 to form a configuration of n D7-branes [27]. The construction of odddimensional fuzzy sphere solutions is actually non-trivial\nand requires the introduction of spinorial representations\n[28] of SO(2k), where k \u2208 Z.\nOne important simplification to the above action is\nwhen we consider the large-N limit, as the STr operation\nreduces to a trace (up to 1/N corrections). The reason\nwhy this limit is important can be understood when one\nconsiders the dual description of the brane configuration.\nRecall that the Myers effect describes lower-dimensional\nbranes being polarized into higher-dimensional configurations via a fuzzy sphere. This means that there is a\ndual description of the Myers effect in terms of a higherdimensional (spherical) brane with world-volume flux.\nMore concretely we see that that (assuming the scalars lying in irreducible representations of SO(3)) N D3-branes\nare dual to a single D5-brane wrapped on S 2 \u00d7 R3 with\nN units of flux through the S 2 [29]. Duality in this sense\nactually means that the effective actions are identical,\nprovided that the U (1) flux on the D5-brane is large.\nThe above statements are all assumed to be true in a\ncurved background, although the required string scattering calculations are difficult to be computed to the\nnecessary order and therefore a direct check is not possible. However given the prevalence of such dualities in\nstring theory, one can be reasonably confident that the\nstatement is correct.\nThe most general cosmological backgrounds in type II\nstring theory can be written in the following form [30]\nds2 = h2 (\u03c1)ds24 + h\u22122 (\u03c1)(d\u03c12 + \u03c12 ds2X5 ),\n\n(4)\n\nwhere h is the warp factor, which is a function of \u03c1 - a\nwarped throat that is fibred over some five-dimensional\nmanifold X5 , and the four-dimensional metric takes the\nusual FRW-form. For concreteness we will specialize\nto the case of type IIB string theory, where the throat\ncan be generated by threading D3-brane flux through\na compact three-cycle. Moreover, since the dilaton is\nconstant in these backgrounds, the Einstein frame and\nString frames coincide. We will also assume that our\ntheory consists of N D3-branes which are oriented paral-\n\n\f3\nlel to the (3 + 1)-large dimensions and that the scalars\nare homogeneous, transforming under irreducible representations of SO(3) \u223c SU (2). The resulting action for\nN coincident D3-branes can be written as [16]2\nS = \u2212T\n\nZ\n\n4\n\n\u221a\n\nd \u03beN \u2212g4\n\n\u00bb\n\nq\nq\n\u22124\n2\n2\nh 1 \u2212 h \u03bb \u0108 \u1e58 1 + 4\u03bb2 \u0108h\u22124 R4 \u2212\n \u0303\n\u2212h4 + V (R) , (5)\n4\n\nwith T the warped, positive-definite brane tension. The\nradius of the fuzzy sphere is defined in terms of the geometric radius \u03c1 via\nR2 =\n\n\u03c12\n\u03bb2 \u0108\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nand \u0108 is the quadratic Casimir of SU (2), namely \u0108 =\nN 2 \u2212 1. We have also included a scalar potential contribution arising from the interaction of the D3-branes with\nthe closed string background. We remind the reader that\nat large N this action is precisely the same as that arising from a single wrapped D5-brane with N units of U (1)\nflux.\n\u221a\nIt is convenient to use the field redefinition \u03c6 = \u03c1/ T ,\nwith \u03c1 the induced world-volume scalar coming from the\nbackground in the string frame [16]. However, it has\n(mass) dimension \u22121 and thus since we desire to write all\nthe fields with canonical mass terms we have to redefine\nthe involved world-volume scalars. Following these lines,\nthe action (5) can be re-written in the generalized form\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u221a\nS = \u2212 d4 \u03be \u2212g4 T (\u03c6)W (\u03c6)\u03b3 \u22121 \u2212 T (\u03c6) + V (\u03c6) ,\n\n(7)\nwhere \u03b3 = [1 \u2212 \u03c6\u0307 /T (\u03c6)]\nis the usual generalization\nof the relativistic factor. The cosmological consequences\nof such an action have been discussed elsewhere [16] and\nwe refer the interested reader there for more details.\nThe appearance of the positive-definite function W (\u03c6),\nwhich generalizes the aforementioned action comparing\nto the usual W (\u03c6) \u2261 1 case, can be theoretically justified [20], since if N multiple coincident branes are\npresent then the world-volume field theory is a U (N )\nnon-Abelian gauge theory and this \"potential\" term is\nsimply a reflection of the additional degrees of freedom\n[21]. Additionally, this configuration is related to a D5brane, wrapping a two-cycle within the compact space\nand carrying a non-zero magnetic flux along this cycle.\nOn the other hand, the positive-definite effective potential V (\u03c6) accounts for the possible open or closed string\ninteractions. Its precise form depends upon the number\nof additional branes and geometric moduli, the number\nof non-trivial cycles in the compact space, the choice of\nembedding for branes on these cycles, the coupling of\n2\n\n2\n\n\u22121/2\n\nFor D\u03043-branes we would require the second term to take the\npositive sign.\n\nthe brane to any background RR-form fields, the contribution from higher dimensional bulk forms [31] etc. Finally, note that using the above generalized form for the\naction, allows us to interpolate between a single D3-brane\n(taking W (\u03c6) \u2192 1) and the multi-brane, or wrapped D5brane (where W (\u03c6) > 1) solutions.\n\nIII.\n\nGHOST D-BRANE COSMOLOGY\n\nIt is well established that Dp-branes are not the only\nhypersurfaces within string theory. There are also Orientifold Op-planes which have negative tension and reduced\ncharge (compared to the Dp-branes) [32]. Their role is\nvital in flux compactifications of type II string theory,\nsince they cancel global flux tadpoles and also break one\nhalf of the residual supersymmetries. There exists another type of extended object, which has been dubbed a\nGhost-brane [33], that we will briefly describe using the\nboundary state formalism, which is the most appropriate\nfor the CFT description of Dp-branes.\nThe bosonic sector of a BPS Dp-brane is represented\nby a boundary state of the form\n|D >= |D >N SN S +|D >RR ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere |D > represents the full Dp-brane state. It was\nshown in [33, 34] that one can define an analogous (BPS)\nGhost-brane state (which we will denote by a Gp-brane)\nthrough the introduction of an operator g:\n|G >= |gD >= \u2212|D >,\n\n(9)\n\nsuch that the ghost state precisely cancels the combined\nBPS sectors of the Dp-brane. Since the Gp-brane state\npreserves the overall relative sign of the two different sectors, it must also preserve the same supersymmetries as\nthe Dp-brane. This makes it a distinct object, and it\nshould not be confused with the D\u0304p-brane - which has a\nboundary state of the form\n|D\u0304 >= |D >N SN S \u2212|D >RR .\n\n(10)\n\nThe formalism implies that the Gp-sector exactly cancels\nthe Dp-sector. This means that a theory consisting of N\ncoincident Dp-branes and M coincident Gp-branes can\nbe described in two equivalent ways; either by (N \u2212 M )\nDp-branes or by (M \u2212 N ) Gp-branes. The corresponding\nworld-volume theory is given by a U (N ) \u00d7 U (M ) gauge\ntheory, which is enhanced to U (N |M ) as the two groups\nof branes are brought together. Importantly, this means\nthat when N = M the resulting solution is simply spacetime with no Dp-branes. In this way we see that the ghost\nbrane can screen the Dp-brane, and a useful consequence\nof this screening was employed in AdS/CFT framework\nin [35].\nSince the Gp-brane is simply minus the standard Dpbrane state, one sees that the effective world-volume theory for the Gp-brane is also of DBI form, albeit with an\n\n\f4\nadditional sign change in the definition of the tension.\nThus, for multiple coincident G3-branes, we expect the\neffective theory to be well described by the action\nS=\n\nZ\n\n1\n(\u03c1M + \u03c1\u03c6 ),\n3Mp2\n1\n\u1e22 = \u2212\n[\u03c1M + pM + \u03c1\u03c6 + p\u03c6 ]\n2Mp2\ni\n1 h\n2\n,\n\u03c1\n+\np\n\u2212\n\u03b3W\n(\u03c6)\n\u03c6\u0307\n= \u2212\nM\nM\n2Mp2\n\nH2 =\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u221a\nd4 \u03be \u2212g4 T (\u03c6)W (\u03c6)\u03b3 \u22121 \u2212 T (\u03c6) \u2212 V (\u03c6) , (11)\n\nwhere we have embedded the branes in the warped background (4). Note that in the non-relativistic expansion\nof this action, the kinetic term will have the wrong sign,\nimplying phantom-like behavior for the scalar fluctuations. This suggests that the world-volume theory tends\nto anti-gravitate, rather than gravitate.\nWe stress that the G3-brane theory is different from\npreviously proposed phantom models based on the DBIaction [36], which have been constructed in the light of\nthe non-BPS action proposed by Sen as an effective description of tachyon condensation [37]. The models in\nthis class have the wrong sign kinetic term inside the\nsquare-root structure, in contrast to that of the ghost action. Furthermore, that sign-change can only be inserted\nby hand [38], since the world-volume metric is induced\nfrom the background geometry, and it is unlikely to contain a sub-manifold where the sign changes in a continuous fashion 3 . Additionally, the non-BPS action can only\ncouple to any of the bulk RR-form fields through terms\nof the form dT \u2227 C (3) , which are typically zero according to our assumptions. Therefore, it seems unlikely that\nsuch boundary states can be stable within the full theory.\nOn the other hand, the ghost branes are supersymmetric and do couple to the bulk form-fields, suggesting that\nthey constitute actually stable states within the theory.\nLet us now focus on the cosmological consequences of\nthe scenario at hand. Assuming that the scalar is timedependent, one reads off the diagonal components of the\nenergy momentum-tensor in the usual fashion:\n\u03c1\u03c6 = T (\u03c6)[1 \u2212 W (\u03c6)\u03b3] + V (\u03c6)\n\np\u03c6 = T (\u03c6)[W (\u03c6)\u03b3\n\n\u22121\n\n\u2212 1] \u2212 V (\u03c6).\n\n(12)\n(13)\n\nThus, since in DBI-constructions \u03c6 is responsible for dark\nenergy, we can define its equation-of-state parameter as:\nw\u03c6 =\n\nT (\u03c6)[W (\u03c6)\u03b3 \u22121 \u2212 1] \u2212 V (\u03c6)\np\u03c6\n=\n.\n\u03c1\u03c6\nT (\u03c6)[1 \u2212 W (\u03c6)\u03b3] + V (\u03c6)\n\n(14)\n\nAs can be deduced from expression (14), the dark-energy\nequation-of-state parameter can present quintessence or\nphantom behavior, depending on the choice of scalar potential and background.\nThe Friedmann equations arising from action (11)\n\n3\n\nwrite:\n\nLeaving aside any issues concerning type II* string theory [39]\nfor the moment.\n\n(15)\n\n(16)\n\nwith H \u2261 \u0227/a the Hubble parameter. Additionally, variation of the action (11) with respect to \u03c6 leads to the\nequation of motion for the scalar field, namely:\n3HW (\u03c6) \u03b3 \u03c6\u0307 + W (\u03c6)\u03b3 3 \u03c6\u0308 \u2212 V\u03c6 (\u03c6) + W\u03c6 (\u03c6)T (\u03c6)\u03b3 +\n\u0003\nT\u03c6 (\u03c6) \u0002\nW (\u03c6)\u03b3(3 \u2212 \u03b3 2 ) \u2212 2 = 0, (17)\n+\n2\n\nwhere the subscript \u03c6 denotes differentiation with respect\nto \u03c6. This equation is the generalization of the KleinGordon one in the DBI framework, and using (12),(13)\nit can be written in the usual form \u03c1\u0307\u03c6 + 3H(\u03c1\u03c6 + p\u03c6 ) = 0.\nFinally, the corresponding equation of motion for matter\nwrites \u03c1\u0307M + 3H(\u03c1M + pM ) = 0.\nIV.\n\nCOSMOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS: THE\nGENERAL CASE\n\nIn the previous section we introduced the concept\nof ghost D-branes, and we extracted the dark-energy\nequation-of-state parameter of this ghost version of DBI\nscenario. Thus, we can now investigate the various cosmological possibilities, trying to remain sufficiently general. We mention that we desire to explore the general\nfeatures of w\u03c6 for possible forms of the involved tension\nand potentials, without examining in detail the equations\nof motion. As we see, although a full dynamical investigation would be interesting, this basic \"kinematical\" study\nis sufficient to qualitatively reveal the novel features of\nthe ghost D-brane model.\nLet us first consider the scenario where no scalar potential is present, that is study solely the brane action.\nIn this case the equation of state reduces to\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 W (\u03c6) \u2212 \u03b3\nw\u03c6 =\n.\n(18)\n\u03b3 1 \u2212 W (\u03c6)\u03b3\nFor a general W (\u03c6), in the regime where \u03b3 >> 1 we see\nthat the equation of state is typically zero, unless there\nare divergences in W , which is not the case if we desire\nour model to be physical. On the other hand, in regions\nwhere W (\u03c6) is dominant we find that w\u03c6 \u223c \u22121/\u03b3 2 and\ntherefore it is negative-definite (although small). Similarly, if W (\u03c6) = 1 then w\u03c6 = 1/\u03b3 which is positivedefinite although typically small. Note that physical solutions imply W (\u03c6) \u2265 1, however if we treat the action\nphenomenologically and assume smaller values for W (\u03c6)\nthen we find solutions where w\u03c6 \u2192 0 from above after\nbeing initially large. In conclusion, we observe that the\n\n\f5\npossible solution space is quite large even without a scalar\npotential.\nThis preliminary phenomenology suggests that w\u03c6\ncould cross the \u22121-bound. In particular, the equation\nof state would become phantom if\nW (\u03c6)[1 \u2212 \u03b3 2 ]\n< 0.\n[1 \u2212 W (\u03c6)\u03b3]\n\n(19)\n\nHowever, this condition cannot be met physically, and\nthus we conclude that the brane action alone cannot generate phantom dynamics.\nLet us now turn on the scalar potential term V (\u03c6).\nA first simple solution subclass would be to consider\nT (\u03c6) = 0, where we obtain w\u03c6 = \u22121 recovering the case\nof pure de-Sitter expansion. In the general case of nonzero potential and tension terms, but with V (\u03c6) \u226b T (\u03c6),\nwe can expand (14) in Taylor series acquiring:\nw\u03c6 \u2248 \u22121 +\n\nT (\u03c6) W (\u03c6)(1 \u2212 \u03b3 2 )\n+ ...,\nV (\u03c6)\n\u03b3\n\n(20)\n\nneglecting higher order terms. Therefore, in the relativistic regime (\u03b3 2 >> 1) the correction term will be\nnegative-definite, leading to the realization of the phantom phase. We mention that this phantom realization\nis obtained naturally from a large solution subclass of\nthe model. Additionally, it is not the only combination\nof possibilities which lead to phantom behavior, but just\na simple example. These features reveal that the use\nof ghost D-branes does lead to quintessence and phantom realization, depending on the specific forms of the\npotential-like terms and of the tension in the effective\naction.\nAnother class of solutions will occur when we have\nT (\u03c6) \u226b V (\u03c6), which upon performing the Taylor expansion leads to\n\u001a\n\u001b\nV (\u03c6)\nW (\u03c6)(\u03b3 2 \u2212 1)\n\u03b3 \u2212 W (\u03c6)\n1+\nw\u03c6 \u2248\n\u03b3[\u03b3W (\u03c6) \u2212 1]\nT (\u03c6) [\u03b3W (\u03c6) \u2212 1][\u03b3 \u2212 W (\u03c6)]\n(21)\nat leading order, and therefore it is highly dependent\non the particular background field-parametrization. For\ninitially static configurations (\u03c6\u0307 = 0, i.e \u03b3 = 1) we recover\nthe usual result w\u03c6 \u2248 \u22121, and therefore the static brane\nmimics the cosmological constant. As the velocity of the\nbrane increases we again find that w\u03c6 \u2192 0 along the\nasymptotic branch. On the other hand, if W (\u03c6) \u226b 1 then\nthe equation of state tends to \u22121/\u03b3 2 and therefore will\nrelax to zero from below. Finally, imposing W (\u03c6) = 1,\nthat is considering the single brane case, the resulting\nequation-of-state parameter tends to zero from above as\nthe velocity term increases, as can be seen from (21).\nNote that since \u03b3 \u2265 1, all the cases of the regime T (\u03c6) \u226b\nV (\u03c6) present a quintessence behavior with w\u03c6 \u2265 \u22121.\nAs we have mentioned, in the present work we are\ninterested in exploring the general qualitative features\nof the equation-of-state parameter of ghost D-brane scenario. We have not extracted the equations of motion,\n\nstudying just w\u03c6 as a function of T (\u03c6), W (\u03c6), V (\u03c6) and\n\u03b3, which is itself a function of \u03c6 and \u03c6\u0307. Therefore, for\ngiven T (\u03c6), W (\u03c6), V (\u03c6), the dependence of w\u03c6 on \u03b3\nprovides qualitative information about the phase-space\nstructure. A first observation is that (14) possesses a\nsingularity at\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\nV (\u03c6)\n\u03b3c =\n1+\n.\n(22)\nW (\u03c6)\nT (\u03c6)\nAccording to the specific choice of T (\u03c6), W (\u03c6), V (\u03c6) and\nof initial conditions, a particular universe evolution (i.e a\nparticular orbit of \u03b3(\u03c6, \u03c6\u0307) in the (\u03c6, \u03c6\u0307)-plane) can remain\neither to one or to the other regime, tend asymptotically\ninto the singularity, or even cross it. Such singularities\nare common in field dark energy models, especially in\nphantom ones, and they correspond to Big Rip [3, 40] or\nto realization of a cosmological bounce [41]. Finally, note\nthat if \u03b3c turns out to be less than 1, that is unphysical,\nthen the specific model is free of such behaviors, independently of the initial conditions.\nIn order to provide a more transparent picture of the\nobtained cosmological behavior, in fig. 1 we present the\nsolution space for the simple scenario of fixed V (\u03c6)/T (\u03c6),\nimposing W (\u03c6) = 1 (corresponding to the single brane\nmodel). As we observe, for V (\u03c6)/T (\u03c6) \u226a 1 there is a\n4\n2\n\nw\u03a6\n\n0\n-2\n-4\n-6\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n\u0393\nFIG. 1: The dark energy equation-of-state parameter w\u03c6 as\na function of the generalized relativistic factor \u03b3, for fixed\nW (\u03c6) = 1. The curves correspond to V (\u03c6)/T (\u03c6) = 0.1 (dotted), 1 (dashed) and 10 (dotted-dashed) respectively.\n\nsingularity at \u03b3c = 1.1, thus in almost the whole phasespace the equation-of-state parameter is quintessence-like\nand in particular it is positive-definite and tends to zero\nasymptotically. For larger values of V (\u03c6)/T (\u03c6) (i.e when\nthe scalar potential effect is enhanced comparing to that\nof the tension) we observe the singularity at a specific\n\u03b3c , which in this special subclass (fixed V (\u03c6)/T (\u03c6) and\n\u03c6-independent W ) is constant, i.e \u03c6-independent. For\nvalues of \u03b3 < \u03b3c phantom behavior is realized, while for\n\u03b3 > \u03b3c one finds quintessence-like evolution with w\u03c6 \u2192 0\nfrom above.\n\n\f6\nLet us now consider the same subclass of fixed\nV (\u03c6)/T (\u03c6), but setting W (\u03c6) = 10. This scenario can\nbe obtained in a class of string theory backgrounds with\nG3-branes or a G5-brane with flux. In fig. 2 we depict\nthe corresponding w\u03c6 -behavior as a function of \u03b3. In\n\n0.4\n0.2\n\nw\u03a6\n0.0\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.4\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n\u0393\nFIG. 2: The dark energy equation-of-state parameter w\u03c6 as\na function of the generalized relativistic factor \u03b3, for fixed\nW (\u03c6) = 10. The curves correspond to V (\u03c6)/T (\u03c6) = 0.1 (dotted), 1 (dashed) and 10 (dotted-dashed) respectively.\n\nthis case, for small values of V (\u03c6)/T (\u03c6) the value of \u03b3c\nis unphysical. Therefore, the resulting trajectories are\nquintessence-like, and the model is singularity-free independently of the initial conditions. For larger values of\nV (\u03c6)/T (\u03c6), \u03b3c becomes physical, with \u03b3 < \u03b3c leading to\nphantom behavior and \u03b3 > \u03b3c to quintessence-like one\nwith w\u03c6 \u2192 0+ or w\u03c6 \u2192 0\u2212 .\nIn summary, from this simple solution-subclass we observe an interesting w\u03c6 -behavior. We mention that in\nprinciple, W (\u03c6) and T (\u03c6) are determined by the supergravity background and can have various forms, while\nV (\u03c6) can be more arbitrary since it arises from the interactions of the open/closed string sector which are difficult\nto compute in general. Clearly, considering more general\nscenarios, with various T (\u03c6) and V (\u03c6) or/and not constant W (\u03c6), the resulting cosmological behavior can be\nsignificantly richer.\nV.\n\nSTATIC DARK-ENERGY-DOMINATED\nSOLUTIONS\n\nHaving discussed qualitatively the cosmological behavior of the model at hand, it would be interesting to perform a systematic investigation of the various cosmological solution sub-classes. In particular, we desire to study\nthe cosmologically important scenario of static solutions\n\ncharacterized by complete dark energy domination. We\nexamine whether there exist late-time attractor solutions,\nand if they do exist to determine their observable features, that is the dark-energy equation-of-state parameter and density parameter. Furthermore, we want to extract information about the intermediate-time behavior,\nthat is the evolution towards the aforementioned latetime attractors, since such an investigation could also\nleave imprints in observables related to the cosmological\npast.\nAs usual, we will first transform the cosmological system into its autonomous form [42]: \u1e8a = f(X), where X\nis the column vector constituted by the (suitably defined)\ndimensionless variables and f(X) the corresponding column vector of the autonomous equations, and we extract\nits critical points Xc satisfying \u1e8a = 0. Then, in order to determine the stability properties of these critical\npoints, we expand around Xc , setting X = Xc + U with\nU the perturbations of the variables considered as a column vector. Thus, for each critical point we expand the\nequations for the perturbations up to the first order as\nU\u0307 = \u039e*U, where the matrix \u039e contains the coefficients of\nthe perturbation equations. Thus, for each critical point,\nthe eigenvalues of \u039e determine its type and stability.\nDefining the dimensionless variables\nX=\n\n\u03c6\u0307\nY =\u221a ,\nT\n\n\u03c6\n,\nMp\n\n(23)\n\nthe equations of motion reduce to the following set of\nequations\n\u221a\nY T\n\u1e8a =\nMp\n\n(24)\n\n1\nT\n(3 \u2212 \u03b3 2 ) Y 2\nV\u03c6\n\u221a \u2212 \u221a\u03c6\n+\n\u2212\n2\n3\n2\u03b3\n2\nW \u03b33\nW\u03b3 T\nT\n\u221a\n\u221a\nW\u03c6 T\n3Y p\n\u2212\n\u2212 2\nT (1 \u2212 W \u03b3) + V\n(25)\n2\nW \u03b3\n\u03b3 Mp\n\n\u1e8e =\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\nwhere we have set \u03c1M = 0 = pM since we are investigating the complete dark-energy dominated scenario.\nFurthermore, in terms of the dimensionless variables, the\ndark energy equation-of-state parameter (14) writes:\n#\n\"\n\u221a\np\n2\u22121\n1\n\u2212\nY\nW\n(X)\n.\nw\u03c6 = 1 \u2212 Y 2 \u221a\n1 \u2212 Y 2 \u2212 W (X)\n\n(26)\n\nSince we are interested in static late-time attractors,\nthat is possessing \u03c6\u0307 = 0, the corresponding critical points\nare of the form (Xc , 0).

This expression (together with the potential positivity) imposes\ntight restrictions on the form of the potential, if we desire to obtain a late-time attractor. In particular, it\nrequires potentials where the field is initially localized\nnear \u03c6 \u223c 0 and rolls to larger values (analogous to the\nsmall-field models of inflation). Candidates are therefore\nV \u223c V0 / cosh(\u03be\u03c6), V = V0 cos(\u03c5\u03c6) and V \u223c V0 \u2212 m2 \u03c62 .\nIn order to provide an explicit example of this subclass, we consider the potential V \u223c V0 \u03c62 /\u03c620 . Transforming to the variables \u03c6 = \u03c60 \u03b4X, t = \u03c60 s, where \u03c60 is\na reference field position, we can write the equations of\nmotion (27) in dimensionless form\n\u221a\nd(\u03b4X)\n= \u03b4Y T\n(30)\nds\n\u221a\n3 \u03b4Y p\n2 \u03b4X\nd(\u03b4Y )\n\u221a \u2212\nT (1 \u2212 \u03b3) + (\u03b4X)2 .\n=\nds\n\u03b32\n\u03b33 T\n\nThe usual approach is to depict the phase-space plots in\nthe (X, Y ) plane, and show the convergence to a stable\nfixed point. However, it is more transparent to depict the\nevolution of w in terms of the variable s. Thus, convergence of the system to a static late-time attractor (Xc , 0)\nmeans convergence of w to \u22121 (as can be immediately\nseen from (26) setting Y \u2261 Yc = 0). In fig. 3 we depict w-evolution, for Mp = V0 = 1, W (\u03c6) = T (\u03c6) = 1,\nand for various \u03c60 -values.

Additionally, we see that\nthe location of the (global) minimum is shifted to earlier\nvalues of s as we increase \u03c60 , and it also is closer to the\ncosmological-constant equation of state.\nFor completeness, in fig. 4 we depict another example\nof this solution sub-class, namely corresponding to V =\nV0 / cosh(\u03c6/\u03c60 ), with Mp = V0 = 1 and W (\u03c6) = T (\u03c6) =\n1.

This choice introduces a new mass-scale,\nwhich combined with \u03c60 allows us to write \u01eb = \u03c60 /L.

The top curve corresponds to \u03c60 = 1 and\nthe lower one to \u03c60 = 10.\n\nsupergravity solutions then L is typically large since it\ngoverns the radius of an Ads spacetime, and thus \u01eb will\nbe small. In fig. 5 we present the corresponding w(s).\nOne notices that as \u03c60 is increased, the equation of state\ntends to \u22121 from below, however it is never too far away\nfrom \u22121. Finally, numerical investigation reveals that the\nsolution is sensitive to the \u01eb-value, with smaller \u01eb leading\nwmin to larger time-scales.\n-1.0005\n-1.0010\n\nw\u03a6\n\n-1.0015\n-1.0020\n-1.0025\n-1.0030\n-1.0035\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\ns\nFIG. 5: w-evolution for T (\u03c6) = (\u03c6/L)\u03ba , V (\u03c6) = (\u03c6/\u03c60 )\u03bb\nand W (\u03c6) = 1, in terms of the variable s = t/\u03c60 , for \u01eb =\n\u03c60 /L = 0.1 and \u03ba = \u03bb = 2.

In the simplest case, consisting of a single G3-brane and with\nV (\u03c6)/T (\u03c6) being constant, we see that phantom behavior\nwill dominate the phase-space dynamics for sufficiently\nlarge V (\u03c6)/T (\u03c6), \u03b3, since the phase-space singularity \u03b3c\nis pushed to larger values. Beyond the singularity one\nfinds a quintessence solution, asymptotically tending towards w\u03c6 = 0. Although these features arise from this\nparticular model-subclass, it is clear that more complicated behavior can be revealed considering more general\nW (\u03c6), T (\u03c6), V (\u03c6) cases, with a natural realization of\nquintessence and phantom behavior, of the \u22121-crossing\nand of a Big Rip.\nSurprisingly enough, although the corresponding Dpbrane scenario experiences only quintessence-type solutions [20], the present Gp-model may lead to both\nquintessence or phantom cosmology. One can proceed to\na more detailed investigation of the phase-space behavior of Gp-brane cosmological scenarios, for various cases\nof the involved tension and potentials [43]. Alternatively\none can impose the desired cosmological evolution, and\nre-construct the corresponding aforementioned functions.\nSince in this work we desire to remain general, exploring\nthe qualitative kinematic features of the Gp-brane model,\nwe do not proceed to such extensions, leaving them for a\nfuture investigation [43].\nOne remaining issue pertains to the quantum stability of such a construction. As it is typical for phantom\nmodels, the energy is unbounded from below leading to\npotential problems upon quantization. However, since\nthe Gp-brane is treated semi-classically, we may hope\nthat quantizing the open-string modes with the appropriate boundary conditions may regularize the theory.\nIn particular, since we are dealing with a phantom scalar\nfield, all of the relevant energy conditions are violated.\nThis feature suggests that the phantom may be an unstable mode. To verify the stability one must resort to a\nquantum field-theoretical analysis. However, developing\na quantum theory of world-volume open-string modes using the DBI-action has proven to be difficult, since the\nD-brane itself is a non-perturbative state with regards\nto the string coupling. A boundary state analysis may\nbe possible, but it is beyond the scope of the current\nwork. Finally, we mention that since the usual phantom\nmodels are robust only for small momenta (because at\nlarger momenta the higher-derivative terms dominate),\none could estimate the quasi-stable lifetime of the phantom field, provided the momentum cut-off is fine-tuned\nand the phantom decays solely into gravitons. Similarly,\nwe could follow this line of reasoning for the model at\nhand, although this means that the field should decay\nto the closed-string vacuum in a way that the openstring modes give rise to gravitons. For the static case,\nwhere the G3-branes are localised, they play a similar\n\n\f9\nrole to Orientifold planes. In conclusion, we stress that\nthe quantum stability of such negatively-charged objects\nwithin string theory is still an open question, but one\nthat is ripe for future exploration.\nWe end this work referring to an additional advantage\nof the model at hand, namely that it possesses a concrete UV-completion. Therefore, it would be interesting\nto try to embed such branes into full stringy compactifications, particularly if they could serve as replacements\nfor Orientifold planes. Obviously, the underlying theory\nwould then be N = 2, which is phenomenologically unfavored, however there might be another mechanism in the\n\nbulk which breaks half of this residual supersymmetry.\nExploring the nature of such scenarios is something we\nleave for future endeavor.\n\n[1] A.
