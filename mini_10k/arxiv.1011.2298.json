Sound waves are examples of such objects. Compared to other imaging methods such as Schlieren imaging (see for instance [4]), or stress induced birefringence\nimaging [5], interferometric imaging has the advantage of providing directly quantitative\n1\n\n\fmeasurements. Refractive index maps can be computed from those measurements, and in\nthe case of a sound wave, acoustic pressure can be determined. There are two methods to\nreconstruct phase maps from recorded interferograms. Fringe analysis [2, 6] has the advantage of requiring only one image (or two if fringe shift is used), but implies a reduced spatial\nresolution and phase ambiguities. In multiphase (or phase shifting) interferometry, the map\nof the optical phase is extracted from several images taken while changing the phase of the\nreference beam. Applying this method to time dependent phenomena requires special adaptations to circumvent the slow acquisition rate of common cameras. When the phenomenon\nis a steady sinusoidal oscillation with sufficient amplitude, information can be extracted from\ntime averaged images [7]. This is the case for the popular TV holography method [8]. For\nfast transient phenomena, a time sampling is to be made by using pulsed light sources to get\nimages of the object at particular times. These quasi-instantaneous images registered by the\nCCD camera are read on much longer times. Recording the complete evolution is possible\nfor repetitive transient phenomena by varying the delay between the laser pulse and the\ntriggered phenomenon. Depending on the time scale of the phenomenon under study, pulsed\nlight sources such as pulsed LED [9, 10], Q-switched lasers [11, 12], or even femtosecond\nlaser [13\u201316] have been used.\nRegarding multiphase interferometric imaging for fast transient phenomena, the litterature\nprovides very few examples. Fringe analysis with tilted reference wavefronts seems to be the\nwidely used method, with the drawbacks mentionned previously. It is thus of interest to\ninvestigate whether pulsed multiphase interferometry can provide phase maps, or phase shift\nmaps, for fast transient phase objects. In this article, it is shown that this method can indeed\nbe used in such cases, and provides accurate images with little sensitivity to optical defects.\nThe price to be paid is a longer acquisition process. As an example, a 1 MHz ultrasound pulse\nproduced in water by an hemispherical transducer is imaged. In section 2, the experimental\narrangement is described as well as the procedure to record several images with different\nreference phases, at various time delays. In section 3, the corresponding data processing is\ndetailed. The phase maps are extracted, and unwrapped if phase shifts exceed \u00b1\u03c0. Then an\ninverse Abel transformation is applied to recover the local index of refraction, and hence the\nsound pressure. The result is shown in section 5 and discussed in section 6.\n2.\n\nExperimental setup and procedure\n\nThe experimental setup is sketched in Figure 1. It is based on a Jamin interferometer [17] with\na frequency doubled pulsed Nd:YAG laser as a light source. The Jamin interferometer was\nchosen because of its simplicity and intrinsic stability. When separated, the two interfering\nbeams are close to each other and undergo similar disturbances from air turbulence and\nencountered windows [18]. In the sample region, the two beams are 6 mm apart and are\n2\n\n\f6 mm high. The lens L1 images the entrance rectangular diaphragm A on the sample, while\nL2 makes an image of the sample onto the CCD camera. The laser (Big Sky Laser CFR200)\ndelivers 120 mJ, 8 ns long pulses with a repetition rate of 20 Hz, from which only about 1 \u03bcJ\npulses are derived by 4 vitrous reflections, and a d = 2 gray filter. The optical wavelength\nused is \u03bbo = 532 nm. The laser is transversally highly multimode with a flat top profile. Its\neffective coherence length, as measured with the interferometer by the fringe contrast versus\nthe optical path difference, was found to be 4 mm at half contrast. Hence the optical path\ndifference between the two beams was kept well below this value to get a good contrast. The\nimaging camera (Andor LUCA R) is triggered synchronously with the pulsed laser. Used\nwith a 2 \u00d7 2 binning, it provides 280 \u00d7 502 pixel images of the 6 \u00d7 10.5 mm2 observed region.\nImage resolution is discussed at the end of this section and is of about 20 \u03bcm.\nFor scanning the interferometer, two 4 mm thick parallel plates S1 are introduced in the\nreference beam, with symmetrical tilts to avoid beam displacement (see Fig. 1). They are\nallowed to rotate around an horizontal axis so that their tilt angle can be precisely controlled\naround 5\u25e6 . This is achieved by moving a separator along the vertical axis. When changing its\nheigth h by \u03b4h = 1 mm, the tilt angle is changed by 0.05\u25e6 , and the optical path by 0.14 \u03bcm.\nBecause of their thickness, the plates S1 also introduce a difference of about 4 mm in the\noptical length of the two interferometer paths. In order to keep the optical path difference\nsmaller than the laser coherence length, a second pair of similar plates S2 is introduced in\nthe signal beam. Those are kept fixed. The phase shift between the two beams introduced\nby these devices is approximated as:\nh\nh\n1+s\n\u03c8 = \u03c80 + 2\u03c0\na\na\n\n!\n\n(1)\n\nwhere a \u2243 3.7 mm and s \u2243 0.04 as determined by simple geometrical optics. In fact the two\nparameters a and s depend somewhat on the incidence angle of the beams on the plates,\nwhich cannot be measured easily. So they are left as fitting parameters as explained later.\nThe phase object to be imaged is an ultrasound wave pulse (central frequency 1.06 MHz,\nduration 5 \u03bcs) emitted in water along the vertical axis by a piezoelectric hemisphere (inner\ndiameter 12 mm, outer diameter 16 mm, provided by Channel Industries Inc.). Water used\nwas filtered by reverse osmosis (Millipore Direct-Q ultrapure water system). The thickness\nvibration mode of the transducer is driven by an RF amplifier (RF in Fig. 1) fed with\na function generator (Tektronix AFG3022) triggered from the laser command electronics\nwith an adjustable delay. The same generator also triggers image acquisition by the camera.\nThe sound velocity in water is 1480 m/s [19] at T = 293 K. The sound wavelength is\n\u03bbs \u2243 1.4 mm and the sound pulse length about Ls = 7 mm. The sound pulse time of flight\nfrom the transducer inner surface to its center is about 4 \u03bcs. In the experiment trigger is\ngiven by the laser flash firing. The laser pulse takes place 170 \u03bcs later with a negligible\n3\n\n\fjitter. The sound pulse is sent at time t varied from 157 to 169 \u03bcs by steps of 0.01 \u03bcs\n(Nt = 1200 time steps). For each time step, images are taken for Np = 25 different values\nof h, labeled h(1)...h(p)...h(Np ). The corresponding values of \u03c8, labeled \u03c8(1)...\u03c8(p)...\u03c8(Np ),\nspan an interval set to \u03c8(Np ) \u2212 \u03c8(1) \u2243 3\u03c0. Raw data are a set of Np \u00d7 Nt images labelled\nwith their time delay and phase step. Their recording takes about 30 minutes. For each\nphase step, a reference image is first made by averaging Nav = 20 images without exciting\nthe transducer. These images of an undisturbed medium are later used as reference images for\nsubtraction of a background phase field. The order in which h and t are varied is important\nto minimize interferometer drift effects. The sound pulse insertion time t is varied first at a\nfixed phase step along a complete time series, before changing h to the next phase step.\n3.\n\nPhase map computation\n\nDuring data processing, pixels are treated independently. Hence there is no spatial resolution\nloss due to image processing. Let I(t, p) be the intensity recorded for a given pixel for the\ntime index t and interferometer phase index p. It is expected that [1]:\nI(t, p) = I0 (t) [1 + C(t) cos(\u03c6(t) \u2212 \u03c8(p))]\n\n(2)\n\nwhere I0 (t) is the average intensity, C(t) the fringe contrast, \u03c6(t) the optical phase to be\nmeasured for this particular pixel and \u03c8(p) is the interferometer phase given by equation\n(1) for each value of h. To extract \u03c6(t), one needs to fit the Np values I(t, p) with equation\n(2) with five unknown parameters I0 (t), C(t), \u03c6(t) \u2212 \u03c80 , a, s. Because of the nonlinear term\n(h/a)2 in equation (1), this involves a time consuming nonlinear fitting procedure. Actually\nthe parameters \u03c80 , a and s do not depend much on time and position. Thus they are only\ncomputed for pixels of the reference images for which \u03c6(t) is zero. Actually the variance of a\nis a few percent. Hence, only a mean value over space of those three parameters is computed\nand used in the next steps of the process. In the later images only three parameters are to be\ndetermined for each pixel, namely I0 (t), C(t) cos(\u03c6(t)) and C(t) sin(\u03c6(t)). This can be done\nwith a fast linear method [1, 20] and takes about 1 s for the entire image of one time step.\nThe value \u03c6(t) determined in this way is within the limits \u2212\u03c0, \u03c0 and undergoes possibly\n2\u03c0 phase jumps. The first time step is chosen so that the phase shift amplitude introduced\nby the sound field is less than \u03c0. The phase unwrapping is realized in time for each pixel by\nremoving phase jumps |\u03c6(t + 1) \u2212 \u03c6(t)| larger than \u03c0. This is possible only if time steps verify\nthe sampling condition, i.e. |\u03c6(t + 1) \u2212 \u03c6(t)| < \u03c0 \u2212 2\u03b4\u03c6, where \u03b4\u03c6 is the phase noise. This\ncondition actually sets the value of the time step and consequently the number of steps in\nthe experiment. Usually phase unwrapping is made spatially for each time on the 2D-maps,\nand then made continuous in time. Although many algorithms have been published on this\ntopic [21], it is not a trivial problem. Unwrapping the phase in time for each pixel separately\n4\n\n\fis much easier and faster. The continuity in space for the phase shift map \u03c6(t, x, z)\u2212\u03c6(0, x, z)\nis obtained automatically, because it starts from 0 everywhere and has no later phase jumps.\n4.\n\nFrom phase map to radial sound field\n\nThe phase \u03c6 is assumed to be related to the refractive index by a simple integration along\nthe y-axis parallel to the beam direction in the sample (see Figure 2). More precisely, for\neach pixel (x, z), one takes into account the difference \u03b4n(x, z, y) between the perturbed\nindex n(x, z, y) seen by the signal beam at point (x, y, z) and the refractive index n0 of the\nunperturbed fluid seen by the reference beam on its parallel path. In our case the sound\nfield is rotationnally invariant around the hemisphere axis z so that \u03b4n is a function of z\n\u221a\nand r = x2 + y 2 only. Then the phase map results from an integration of the refractive\nindex variations over the path of the beam from the entrance window (y = \u2212l/2), to the\nexit window (y = l/2):\n2\u03c0\n\u03c6(x, z) =\n\u03bb\n\nl/2\n\nZ\n\nq\n\ndy \u03b4n( x2 + y 2 , z).\n\n\u2212l/2\n\n(3)\n\nNote however that \u03b4n is identically 0 after some finite distance from the center (dashed circle\non Figure 2) because there is still no sound there. Hence equation (3) can be rewritten as:\n2\u03c0\n\u03c6(x, z) =\n\u03bb\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nq\n\ndy \u03b4n( x2 + y 2 , z).\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(4)\n\nwhich is the Abel transform of the \u03b4n(r, z) map. Conversely radial refractive index profiles\ncan be retrieved from phase maps via an inverse Abel tranform. To make that part easier, the\ncamera lines and the signal light beam direction Oy have been carefully aligned parallel to\nthe hemisphere basis. The abscissa x0 of the hemisphere axis is determined as the symmetry\naxis of the projected sound field. Then the Abel inversion of the phase is perfomed for each\nline z on \u03c6(z, x \u2212 x0 ) using the algorithm proposed by [22]. The data are fitted with splines\nover successive sets of 20 pixels.\nAbel inversion procedure is justified provided that light rays do not suffer any significant\ndeviation during their propagation through the studied sample. More precisely the RamanNath condition should be fulfilled, i.e. deviation of a light beam from a straight line over\nthe sample diameter D due to the refractive index gradient should be less than the optical\nresolution \u03b4x. Let \u03bbs be the sound wavelength, \u03bbo the laser light wavelength, \u03c6m the maximum\nphase accumulated across the sample. Then the condition amounts to:\n\u03c6m <\n\n\u03b4x\u03bbs\n.\nD\u03bbo\n\n(5)\n\nWith the values \u03bbo = 0.5 \u03bcm, \u03bbs = 1.4 mm, \u03b4x \u2243 \u03bbs /10, condition (5) puts a rather large\nlimit on \u03c6m , about 50. A second condition is that all rays collected by the imaging optics\n5\n\n\fand originating from a given point of the object undergo the same \u03c6 retardation. Maximum\ntransverse extension of such a ray bundle at the exit of the sample, i.e. at D/2, should be less\nthan the characteristic length over which \u03c6 varies, typically \u03bbs . If \u03b8 is the aperture angle of the\noptics, this is true if \u03b8D/2 < \u03bbs . In our case, D \u2243 16 mm. This leads to the condition \u03b8 < 0.2.\nThe numerical aperture of the imaging lens is about \u03b8 = 0.03 and fulfills the condition. In\nother respects, this numerical aperture should be large enough to ensure the desired optical\nresolution \u03b4x. The current aperture provides a resolution \u03b4x = 1.2\u03bbo /\u03b8 \u2243 20 \u03bcm.\nThe acoustic pressure field is proportional to \u03b4n and is computed from the relation:\n\u03b4P (x, z) = (n(x, z, y) \u2212 n0 )/(\u2202n/\u2202P )\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the water piezo-optic constant is (\u2202n/\u2202P ) \u2243 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22124 MPa\u22121 [23, 24].\n5.\n\nAn example of ultrasound pulse image\n\nIn Figures 3 and 4, three stages are shown from interference images to pressure map when\nthe sound pressure is at its maximum at the focus. On image 3.a, severe optical defects are\nclearly visible : dust particles, diffraction by the hemisphere rim. These defects are nearly\ncompletely washed out in the phase map 3.b. On the contrary, they could be seen obviously\non the contrast map. This appears to be the main advantage of the multiphase method, the\nfitted phase being only weakly sensitive to intensity fluctuations. The signal to noise is good\nenough to yield an acceptable inverse Abel transform, from which the pressure is deduced\nusing equation 6. Its radial profile is shown in Figure 4.a, as well as its time variation at the\nfocus when the sound pulse is going through (Figure 4.b). While the tranducer is excited at\nits resonance frequency by a constant amplitude sinusoidal burst of 5 periods, its response\nincreases in time as expected from a driven damped harmonic oscillator. The oscillation is\nactively damped during the last oscillation. This explains the time profile of the sound pulse\n(Figure 4.b).\nThis imaging method thus provides a way to investigate in detail the focusing properties\nof this type of transducer.\n6.\n\nDiscussion\n\nDiscussions of errors in multiphase interferometry may be found in [1, 2, 20, 25]. Although\nwritten for static interferometric imaging, they apply equally well to the pulsed case. They\nshow that the multiphase technique brings two benefits. The first one is to avoid systematic errors coming from imperfectly scanned phase \u03c8p when predetermined schemes such\nas (\u2212\u03c0/2, 0, \u03c0/2), (\u2212\u03c0/2, 0, \u03c0/2, \u03c0) or (\u2212\u03c0, \u2212\u03c0/2, 0, \u03c0/2, \u03c0) are used [26]. Here the phase is\nnot scanned with an a priori scheme. Its value is extracted from the series of unperturbed\nimages at t = 0. In equation (1) the slope 2\u03c0/a of the actual phase as a function of the\n6\n\n\fscanning parameter h is left free, and a non linearity s is permitted by the fitting process.\nHence the only remaining errors may come from drifts in time of the interferometer. Since\nin the experiment, changing the delay is ten time faster than changing the phase, images\nare taken for a complete time series at a fixed reference phase. This takes about 60 s. Then\nthe reference phase is changed to the next value. In this way a possible drift in time of the\ninterferometer geometry is in some way taken into account by the fitting process of a and s in\nformula (1). This scanning procedure, i.e. 'time first, phase second', is thus to be preferred.\nThe second benefit from multiphase technique results simply from the larger number of\ndata (here 25 images compare to a minimum of 3 to extractqthe phase, and compared to\n\u221a\n1 for fringe analysis). This statistical improvement is thus 25/3 and 25 respectively.\nMore quantitatively, let \u03b4I be the pixel noise for one image (including laser fluctuations and\ndetection noise):\n\u03b4I/I0\n.\n(7)\n\u03b4\u03c6 = q\nCNp\n\nHere \u03b4I/I0 \u2243 0.1, C \u2243 1, Np = 25. This gives \u03b4\u03c6 \u2243 0.02, or \u03bb/300 in a more commonly used\nunit.\nOf course, the imaging technique has two well-known advantages compared to in situ point\nby point pressure measurement with a pressure probe. It provides parallel measurements at\na large number of locations and times. This quality is reflected obviously by the large size\nof the generated data (GBytes). It also provides this information in a non invasive and non\nperturbative way.\nNevertheless one may question the accuracy of the pressure field determined in this way.\nA quantitative analysis of the errors is not easy, in particular due to the lateral averaging\nbrought by the diffraction on formula (3). Also the phase field is not always determined up to\na region where \u03c6 = 0, inducing some error in the inverse Abel transform. Thus, to check the\naccuracy, a direct comparison was made with a fiber-optic probe hydrophone for the pressure\nat the focus. A fiber-optic probe hydrophone [23, 27] determines the liquid refractive index\nmodulation, by measuring the reflection coefficient R at the tip of an optical fiber. Reflection\ncoefficient R is given by the Fresnel formula:\n\"\n\nnf \u2212 (nw + \u03b4nw )\nR=\nnf + (nw + \u03b4nw )\n\n#2\n\n(8)\n\nwhere nf , nw are the optical fiber and water refractive indices. Water refractive index modulations \u03b4nw due to sound waves are retrieved from those of R, after averaging over typically\n100 bursts. Corrections due to the non zero compressibility of the fiber core are taken into\naccount by:\n\u2202nf /\u2202P\n\u03b4nf = \u03b4nw\n.\n(9)\n\u2202nw /\u2202P\n7\n\n\fThe derivatives of refractive indices with respect to pressure are \u2202nw /\u2202P \u2243 1.4\u00d710\u22124 MPa\u22121\n[28] and \u2202nf /\u2202P \u2243 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 MPa\u22121 [29]. The correction amounts to about 7 %.\nThe physical quantity probed by the fiber-optic probe hydrophone and the interferometer\nbeing the same, a direct comparison can be made [30]. The fiber tip was set 0.12 mm\nabove the piezo hemisphere center. This position was determined accurately by the images\nacquired during the measurement. Refractive index variations at the same point were also\ncomputed from interferometric measurements, taken with the hydrophone removed. Results\nare presented in figure 5. Both measurements are compatible within 5 %. This is to be\ncompared to the reproductibility of the hydrophone measurements (typically 10 %), and the\nuncertainties in the inverse Abel transform due to the incomplete phase maps (which can\namount to 5 %). Hence the agreement is satisfactory.\n7.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt appears that multiphase interferometric imaging can be easily applied to repetitive fast\ntransient phenomena for which optical phase is a good observable. It provides quickly extensive data compared to point by point measurements. We have shown in the case of a\nsound wave that these data are quantitatively reliable. The multiphase feature brings a better immunity to optical defects in the images and an improved signal to noise ratio. Phase\nunwrapping in time appears as a very simple and robust algorithm. The longer acquisition\ntime was found acceptable. Hence this method could be more widely used than it has been\nup to now to study fast transient phenomena.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research has been funded by the ERC under the European Community's FP7 Grant\nAgreement n\u25e6 240113 and by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche, contract 05-BLAN-008402 META.\nReferences\n1.
