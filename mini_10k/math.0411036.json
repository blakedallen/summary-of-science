This generalizes the classical Alexsandrov's theorem for\nconvex functions.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nA classical result of Alexsandrov [1] asserts that convex functions in Rn are\ntwice differentiable a.e., (see also [3], [8] for more modern treatments). It is\nwell known that Sobolev functions u \u2208 W 2,p , for p > n/2 are twice differentiable a.e.. The following weaker notion of convexity known as k-convexity\nwas introduced by Trudinger and Wang [12, 13]. Let \u03a9 \u2282 Rn be an open set\nand C 2 (\u03a9) be the class of continuously twice differentiable functions on \u03a9.\nFor k = 1, 2, . . . , n and a function u \u2208 C 2 (\u03a9), the k-Hessian operator, Fk , is\ndefined by\nFk [u] := Sk (\u03bb(\u22072 u)) ,\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere \u22072 u = (\u2202ij u) denotes the Hessian matrix of the second derivatives\nof u, \u03bb(A) = (\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , * * * , \u03bbn ) the vector of eigenvalues of an n \u00d7 n matrix\n1\n\n\fA \u2208 Mn\u00d7n and Sk (\u03bb) is the k-th elementary symmetric function on Rn , given\nby\nX\nSk (\u03bb) :=\n\u03bb i1 * * * \u03bb ik .\n(1.2)\ni1 <***<ik\n\nAlternatively we may write\n\nFk [u] = [\u22072 u]k\n\n(1.3)\n\nwhere [A]k denotes the sum of k \u00d7 k principal minors of an n \u00d7 n matrix A,\nwhich may also be called the k-trace of A. The study of k-Hessian operators\nwas initiated by Caffarelli, Nirenberg and Spruck [2] and Ivochkina [6] with\nfurther developed by Trudinger and Wang [10, 12, 13, 14, 15].\nA function u \u2208 C 2 (\u03a9) is called k-convex in \u03a9 if Fj [u] \u2265 0 in \u03a9 for\nj = 1, 2 . . . , k; that is, the eigenvalues \u03bb(\u22072 u) of the Hessian \u22072 u of u lie in\nthe closed convex cone given by\n\u0393k := {\u03bb \u2208 Rn : Sj (\u03bb) \u2265 0, j = 1, 2, . . . , k} .\n\n(1.4)\n\n(see [2] and [13] for the basic properties of \u0393k .) We notice that F1 [u] = \u2206u, is\nthe Laplacian operator and 1-convex functions are subharmonic. When k =\nn, Fn [u] = det(\u22072 u), the Monge-Amp\u00e9re operator and n-convex functions\nare convex. To extend the definition of k-convexity for non-smooth functions\nwe adopt a viscosity definition as in [13]. An upper semi-continuous function\nu : \u03a9 \u2192 [\u2212\u221e, \u221e) (u 6\u2261 \u2212\u221e on any connected component of \u03a9) is called kconvex if Fj [q] \u2265 0, in \u03a9 for j = 1, 2, . . . , k, for every quadratic polynomial q\nfor which the difference u\u2212q has a finite local maximum in \u03a9. Henceforth, we\nshall denote the class of k-convex functions in \u03a9 by \u03a6k (\u03a9). When k = 1 the\nabove definition is equivalent to the usual definition of subharmonic function,\nsee, for example (Section 3.2, [5]) or (Section 2.4, [7]). Thus \u03a61 (\u03a9) is the class\nof subharmonic functions in \u03a9. We notice that \u03a6k (\u03a9) \u2282 \u03a61 (\u03a9) \u2282 L1loc (\u03a9) for\nk = 1, 2, . . . , n, and a function u \u2208 \u03a6n (\u03a9) if and only if it is convex on each\ncomponent of \u03a9. Among other results Trudinger and Wang [13] (Lemma 2.2)\nproved that u \u2208 \u03a6k (\u03a9) if and only if\n!\nZ\nn\nX\nu(x)\naij \u2202ij \u03c6(x) dx \u2265 0\n(1.5)\n\u03a9\n\ni,j\n\nfor all smooth compactly supported functions \u03c6 \u2265 0, and for all constant\nn \u00d7 n symmetric matrices A = (aij ) with eigenvalues \u03bb(A) \u2208 \u0393\u2217k , where \u0393\u2217k is\ndual cone defined by\n\u0393\u2217k : = {\u03bb \u2208 Rn : h\u03bb, \u03bci \u2265 0 for all \u03bc \u2208 \u0393k } .\n2\n\n(1.6)\n\n\fIn this note we prove the following Alexsandrov type theorem for k-convex\nfunctions.\nTheorem 1.1. Let k > n/2, n \u2265 2 and u : Rn \u2192 [\u2212\u221e, \u221e) (u 6\u2261 \u2212\u221e on\nany component of Rn ), be a k-convex function. Then u is twice differentiable\nalmost everywhere. More precisely, we have the Taylor's series expansion for\nLn x a.e.,\n1\nu(y) \u2212 u(x) \u2212 h\u2207u(x) , y \u2212 xi \u2212 h\u22072 u(x)(y \u2212 x) , y \u2212 xi = o(|y \u2212 x|2 ) ,\n2\n(1.7)\nas y \u2192 x.\nIn Section 3 (see, Theorem 3.2.), we also prove that the absolute continuous part of the k-Hessian measure (see, [12, 13]) \u03bck [u], associated to a kconvex function for k > n/2 is represented by Fk [u]. For the Monge-Amp\u00e9re\nmeasure \u03bc[u] associated to a convex function u, such result is obtained in\n[16].\nTo conclude this introduction we note that it is equivalent to assume\nonly Fk [q] \u2265 0, in the definition of k-convexity [13]. Moreover \u0393k may also\nbe characterized as the closure of the positivity set of Sk containing the\npositive cone \u0393n , [2].\n\n2\n\nNotations and preliminary results\n\nThroughout the text we use following standard notations. | * | and h*, *i will\nstand for Euclidean norm and inner product in Rn , and B(x, r) will denote\nthe open ball in Rn of radius r centered at x. For measurable E \u2282 Rn , Ln (E)\nwill denote its Lebesgue measure. For a smooth function u, the gradient and\nHessian of u are denoted by \u2207u = (\u22021 u, * * * , \u2202n u) and \u22072 u = (\u2202ij u)1\u2264i,j\u2264n\nrespectively. For a locally integrable function f , the distributional gradient\nand Hessian are denoted by Df = (D1 f, * * * , Dn f ) and D 2 u = (Dij u)1\u2264i,j\u2264n\nrespectively.\nFor the convenience of the readers, we cite the following H\u00f6lder and gradient estimates for k-convex functions, and the weak continuity result for\nk-Hessian measures, [12, 13].\n0,\u03b1\nTheorem 2.1.

Let u be a 2-convex function in Rn .\nFor A \u2208 Sn\u00d7n , the space of n \u00d7 n symmetric matrices, define the distribution\nTA : Cc2 (Rn ) \u2192 R, by\nZ\nn\nX\nTA (\u03c6) :=\naij \u2202ij \u03c6(x) dx\nu(x)\nRn\n\ni,j\n\nBy (1.5), TA (\u03c6) \u2265 0 for A \u2208 Sn\u00d7n with eigenvalues \u03bb(A) \u2208 \u0393\u22172 , and \u03c6 \u2265 0.\nTherefore, by Riesz representation (see, for example Theorem 2.14 in [9] or\nTheorem 1, Section 1.8 in [3]), there exist a Borel measure \u03bcA in Rn , such\nthat\nZ\nZ\nn\nX\nij\nTA (\u03c6) =\n\u03c6\na Dij u dx =\n\u03c6 d\u03bcA ,\n(2.5)\nRn\n\nRn\n\ni,j\n\nfor all \u03c6 \u2208 Cc2 (Rn ) and all n \u00d7 n symmetric matrices A with \u03bb(A) \u2208 \u0393\u22172 .\nIn order to prove the second order distributional derivatives Dij u of u to be\nsigned Borel measures, we need to make special choices for the matrix A.\nBy taking A = In , the identity matrix, \u03bb(A) \u2208 \u0393\u22171 \u2282 \u0393\u22172 , we obtain a Borel\nmeasure \u03bcIn such that\nZ\nZ\nn\nX\n\u03c6\nDii u dx =\n\u03c6 d\u03bcIn ,\n(2.6)\nRn\n\nRn\n\ni=1\n\nfor all \u03c6 \u2208 Cc2 (Rn ). Therefore, the trace of the distributional Hessian D 2 u, is\na Borel measure. For each i = 1, . . . , n, let Ai be the diagonal matrix with all\nentries 1 but the i-th diagonal entry being 0. Then by the characterization\nof \u0393\u22172 in (2.3), it follows that \u03bb(Ai ) \u2208 \u0393\u22172 .

This proves the theorem.\nLet u be a k-convex function and \u03bck [u] be the associated k-Hessian measure.

Let u be a k-convex function, k > n/2 and u\u01eb be the mollification\nof u.

Since u is twice\n2,1\ndifferentiable a.e. (by Theorem 1.1) and u \u2208 Wloc\n(\u03a9) (by Theorem 2.5), we\nconclude that \u22072 u\u01eb \u2192 \u22072 u in L1loc . Let \u03bck [u\u01eb ] and \u03bck [u] are the Hessian\nmeasures associated to the functions u\u01eb and u respectively. Then the by\nweak continuity Theorem 2.3 (Theorem 1.1, [13]), \u03bck [u\u01eb ] converges to \u03bck [u]\nin measure and \u03bck [u\u01eb ] = Fk [u\u01eb ] dx.

We would like to prove that\nh(x) = Fk [u](x) Ln a.e. x.
