Such wave functions are known to\nrepresent states of the resonating-valence-bond (RVB) type. In the present work I discuss the RVB\nstructure of a GP singlet superconducting state with nodes in the spectrum. The resulting state for\nthe undoped spin system may be described in terms of the \"path integral\" over loop coverings of the\nlattice, thus extending the known construction for RVB states. The problem of topological order in\nGP states may be reformulated in terms of the statistical behavior of loops. The simple example of\nthe projected d-wave state on the square lattice demonstrates that the statistical behavior of loops\nis renormalized in a nontrivial manner by the projection.\n\nGutzwiller-projected (GP) wave functions have been\noften applied to describe the unconventional properties\nof high-temperature superconductors and the spin-liquid\nphase of frustrated spin-1/2 systems [1, 2, 3, 4]. Since\nthe early days of their use for strongly correlated systems, GP wave functions have been known not only to\nprovide a good variational ansatz, but also to represent\nthe resonating-valence-bond (RVB) physics of the ground\nstate. Because of their RVB structure, the GP wave functions merit deep investigation as independent objects, irrespective of the underlying physical Hamiltonian [5, 6].\nIt was shown in the original anaysis of GP superconducting wave functions [1] that such wave functions correspond to the RVB states with singlet amplitudes aij\ngiven by the Fourier transform of\na(k) =\n\nuk\n,\nvk\n\n(1)\n\nwhere uk and vk are the coherence factors of the BCS\nwave function before projection. For a fully gapped superconductor, this procedure produces amplitudes aij\ndecaying exponentially with the site separation |i \u2212 j|,\nand the interpretation as a RVB state is straightforward. However, in the case of a BCS superconductor\nwith nodes, including the commonly used dx2 \u2212y2 state,\nthis simple derivation produces values of a(k) singular at\nthe nodal points, and the resulting singlet amplitudes aij\nare long-ranged. Therefore, in the case of a superconductor with nodes, the conventional derivation cannot\ninterpret the GP wave function as a RVB state.\nIn this note I resolve the problem of interpreting the\nphysical content of the GP wave function by using an alternative representation in terms of the \"loop-soup\" path\nintegral. In this construction, well-known for RVB states,\nthe correlation functions are expressed as sums over all\nclose-packed coverings of the lattice with closed loops\n[7, 8, 9]. In the conventional RVB loop construction,\nthe statistical weights are determined by the products\nof singlet amplitudes along the loops. In my generalized\nderivation, the product of singlet amplitudes is replaced\nby the trace of the product of the BCS Green's functions\n\nalong the loop. Thus the role of the RVB singlet amplitudes is played by the BCS Green's functions (2\u00d72 matrices). In the case of a superconductor with nodes, the\nBCS Green's functions are only marginally local: they\ndecay algebraically with distance. It is therefore clear\nthat caution is required when applying the spin-liquid\nRVB scenario to high-temperature superconductors [10].\nThe paper is continued with a brief discussion of the\nrelation of the loop-soup construction to the topological\norder predicted for RVB states [5, 6, 11, 12, 13]. The\npresence of topological order corresponds to disordered\nshort-ranged loops.\nI then employ the example of the undoped GP d-wave\nstate on the square lattice to demonstrate the possibility\nof strong renormalization of the loop statistics by projection. The loop-length distribution may be characterized by spin-spin correlations which decay algebraically\nwith distance. The power of the algebraic decay is nonuniversal and depends on the variational parameter of\nthe wave function.\nThe derivation begins by defining the GP wave function. I consider a system consisting of spins 1/2 occupying a finite lattice with an even number of sites N . The\nGP wave function is constructed by using an auxiliary\nHamiltonian of the BCS form,\ni\nX h\n\u2020\ntij \u03c8i\u03b1\n\u03c8j\u03b1 + h.c.\nH =\n{ij},\u03b1\n\n+\n\ni\nXh\n\u2020 \u2020\n\u2020 \u2020\n\u2206ij (\u03c8i\u2191\n\u03c8j\u2193 \u2212 \u03c8i\u2193\n\u03c8j\u2191 ) + h.c.\n\n(2)\n\n{ij}\n\n(in this general form the hopping and pairing amplitudes\nbetween any pairs of sites are arbitrary). The Hamiltonian is spin-rotation invariant (it involves only singlet\npairing), and its ground state \u03a8BCS is a spin singlet.\nThe GP wave function \u03a8GP for the undoped system is\nconstructed by projecting onto states with exactly one\nfermion per lattice site (Gutzwiller projection). The resulting wave function may be written as a wave function\nof spin variables \u03a8GP ({\u03c3i }), where the spins \u03c3i must contain N/2 up and N/2 down spins.\n\n\f2\nThe Hamiltonian (2) contains more information than\nrequired for the construction of the wave fucntion. First,\nthe Gutzwiller projection selects states invariant with respect to SU(2) gauge rotations in the particle-hole space\n[14, 15]. Different Hamiltonians related by such SU(2)\ngauge symmetries therefore produce the same projected\nwave function \u03a8GP . Second, the Hamiltonian (2) contains information not only about its eigenfunctions, but\nalso about the spectrum, which is not used in the construction of the wavefunction. To eliminate the latter redundancy, we shall use the equal-time Green's function\n(the \"projector operator\") instead of the Hamiltonian.\nTo construct the equal-time Green's functions, we first\ndefine the 2N -dimensional vector space of fermionic operators\ni\nXh\n\u2020\n(3)\nu(i)\u03c8i\u2191\n+ v(i)\u03c8i\u2193\n\u03b3=\ni\n\n(the sum is taken over the N lattice sites). This space\nhas the Hermitian form defined by the anti-commutator\n{\u03b31\u2020 , \u03b32 }, and the Hamiltonian (2) acts in this space as\na Hermitian operator. The eigenvalue equations are the\nBogoliubov\u2013de Gennes equations\n[H, \u03b3] = E\u03b3.\n\n(4)\n\nThe spectrum of the eigenvalues consists of pairs of opposite energies \u00b1E: this is the consequence of the spinrotational invariance of the Hamiltonian (2). For each solution (u, v) with energy E, the pair (v \u2217 , \u2212u\u2217 ) gives a solution with energy \u2212E. Thus there are N positive-energy\nsolutions and N negative-energy solutions to Eq. (4).\nNext we define the projector onto the negative-energy\nstates,\nX\nG=\n|\u03b3k i h\u03b3k | ,\n(5)\nEk <0\n\nwhere |\u03b3k i are normalized eigenstates [solutions of (4)].\nThe operator G constructed in this way is a 2N \u00d7 2N\nHermitian matrix which may be considered as a singleparticle projector onto the negative-energy states or,\nequivalently, as the matrix of equal-time Green's functions. It contains no information about the eigenvalues of (4), but only about the eigenfunctions. Thus the\nprojector G contains less information than the original\nHamiltonian, but remains sufficient for constructing the\nmulti-particle ground-state wave function.\nIn real space, the operator G may be represented by\nthe set of 2 \u00d7 2 matrices Gij for each pair of lattice sites\n(i, j). The hermiticity implies\nG\u2020ij = Gji .\n\n(6)\n\nThe SU(2) gauge transformation acts on G by conjugation\nGij 7\u2192 Wi\u2020 Gij Wj ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere Wi are the SU(2) matrices of the gauge transformation.\nFrom the completeness of the basis of all states \u03b3k\nand from the E \u2192 \u2212E symmetry (i.e. from the spinrotational invariance), we can derive the following identity for Gij :\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0 1\nJ=\nGij + J \u2020 G\u2217ij J = \u03b4ij 1,\n.\n(8)\n\u22121 0\nMathematically, this identity expresses the fact that G \u2212\n1\n2 belongs to the Lie algebra sp(N ) (see, for example,\nRef. 16). One may verify that Eq. (8) is invariant with\nrespect to SU(2) gauge rotations.\nFrom the SU(2) invariance of Gutzwiller projection,\nit follows that the wave function depends only on the\nSU(2)-gauge-invariant properties of the Green's functions\nGij . For future application, we define the cyclic trace of\nthe Green's functions\nTi1 ...il =\n\n1\nTr(Gi1 i2 Gi2 i3 . . . Gil i1 ) ,\n2\n\n(9)\n\nwhich depends on the oriented closed loop i1 i2 . . . il . This\ntype of cyclic trace appears below in the loop path integral.\nTo proceed with the loop construction, we first express\nthe wave function in terms of the negative-energy states\n\u03b3k and further develop the loop path integral for groundstate expectation values.\nThe BCS ground state of the Hamiltonian (2) may be\nexpressed as\nY\n\u03a8BCS =\n\u03b3k |\u2193 ... \u2193i ,\n(10)\nEk <0\n\nwhere |\u2193 ... \u2193i is the state with all lattice sites occupied\nQ \u2020\n|0i, and the operators\nby down spins, |\u2193 ... \u2193i = i \u03c8i\u2193\n\u03b3k are the negative-energy eigenvectors of Eq. (4).\nAfter projecting onto singly-occupied states, this wave\nfunction may be shown to yield for the GP wave function\n\u03a8GP ({\u03c3i }) = Detk,i [uk (i)|vk (i)] ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere [uk (i)|vk (i)] is the N \u00d7 N matrix whose first N/2\ncolumns are composed of the coefficients uk (i) while the\nlast N/2 columns involve those of vk (i). The index k\nreferes to all negative-energy states and the index i to all\nspin-up sites in the given spin configuration {\u03c3i }.\nAlternatively, the same wave function may be written\nin the same form (11), but with the index i labeling spindown sites. It follows from the rotation invariance that\nthese two determinants must give the same wave function, to within an overall phase factor.\nThe experssion for the \"partition function\" h\u03a8|\u03a8i is\nobtained by taking for the bra-vector the determinant\n(11) over the spin-up sites and for the ket-vector the same\ndeterminant over the spin-down sites. The product of the\n\n\f3\n\nj\n\ni\nG ij\n(a)\n\n+\n\u2212 G ij\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 1: (a) An example of covering the lattice by loops in the\n\"loop-soup\" construction. (b) To each link of the loop, there\ncorresponds a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix Green's function Gij . Each (oriented) loop is assigned the amplitude \u22122Ti1 ...il . The origin of\nthe negative sign in the loop amplitude lies in the fermionic\nstatistics in the GP construction. The vertices are labeled\nwith up or down spins which alternate along the loop. The\nfactor of two in the loop amplitude is due to the two possible\nspin labelings of the loop.\n\ntwo determinants is then rewritten as the determinant of\nthe product of the two matrices (taking the sum over the\nindex k) to yield\n|\u03a8GP ({\u03c3i })|2 = const Detij [Gij ],\n\n(12)\n\nwhere i labels spin-up sites and j labels spin-down sites.\nThe matrix [Gij ] is the N \u00d7 N matrix composed of 2 \u00d7 2\nblocks Gij . The constant prefactor does not depend on\nthe spin configuration {\u03c3i } and will be omitted in further calculations. The expression (12) is explicitly SU(2)\ngauge-invariant.\nThe determinant (12) may be further expanded as a\nproduct of non-intersecting loops and summed over all\npossible spin configurations {\u03c3i } to produce the partition\nfunction h\u03a8|\u03a8i. Brief algebraic manipulations using the\nsymmetry (8) give the loop path integral\nXY\nh\u03a8|\u03a8i =\n(13)\n(\u22122Ti1 ...iln ) ,\n{Cn } n\n\nwhere the sum is taken over all coverings by nonintersecting loops of even length, and Ti1 ...iln are the loop\ntraces defined in Eq. (9), see Fig. 1. The sum (13) [and\nall loop sums below] is to be understood as that over\noriented loops. From the symmetry (8) it follows that\nthe traces Ti1 ...iln for even-length loops are purely real\nand do not depend on the orientation of the loop. However, it is important to preserve loop orientations in the\ndefinition of the sum (13), because they affect the multiplicities of length-two loops: every length-two loop has\nonly one orientation and appears in the sum (13) once;\nall longer loops admit two orientations and appear twice.\nThis result has the form of a path integral in which different correlation functions may be computed. For example, the spin-spin correlation function hSz (i)Sz (j)i may\nbe written as\nhSz (i)Sz (j)i =\n\ni\u2194j\nY\nX\n1\n(\u22121)Pij\n(\u22122Ti1 ...iln ) ,\nh\u03a8|\u03a8i\nn\n{Cn }\n\n(14)\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 2: Defining topological sectors on a cylinder. The \"reference line\" (dashed) connects the two edges of the cylinder.\n(a) The \"plus-minus\" sectors in the loop path integral are\ngenerated by changing the sign of Green's functions Gij intersecting the reference line. (b) The \"even-odd\" sectors in\nthe RVB states are selected as those with an even (odd, respectively) number of singlets intersecting the reference line.\n\nwhere the sum is now taken only over loop coverings with\nthe sites i and j belonging to the same loop, and (\u22121)Pij\ntakes values \u00b11 depending on whether the number of\nloop links between i and j is even or odd.\nThe path integral (13) has the same form as the loop\nconstruction for RVB states. Most generally, the loop\npath integral may be written as\nXY\nh\u03a8|\u03a8i =\nA(Cn ) ,\n(15)\n{Cn } n\n\nwhere A(Cn ) is an amplitude depending on the geometry\nof the loop Cn .\nThis general formulation includes many different RVBtype wave functions in a variety of systems. The GP wave\nfunctions in Anderson's derivation [1] correspond to the\nloop amplitude\nA(Cn ) = \u22122ai1 i2 ai2 i3 . . . ail i1 ,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere aij are the singlet amplitudes defined from (1).\nNote the importance of the negative sign in the loop\namplitudes (13) and (16). This sign arises from the\nfermionic statistics involved in the GP construction. Alternatively, for a spin system it is possible to construct a\n\"bosonic\" product of singlets which leads to a loop amplitude similar to Eq. (16), but without the negative sign\n[7, 8, 9].\nRemarkably, the Rokhsar\u2013Kivelson ground state of\ndimer models [11] may also be described with the same\nformalism (15): it is sufficient to set A(Cn ) equal to 1\nfor length-two loops on allowed dimer positions and to 0\notherwise.\nThe concept of the \"loop soup\" aids in visualizing the\nconditions required for the topological order proposed for\nRVB states [11, 12, 13]. As explained in Refs. 5, 6, the\ndifferent topological sectors on a multiply connected domain (e.g. on a cylinder or a torus) may be accessed by\nimposing periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions on\nthe fermions in the Hamiltonian (2) along a topologically\nnontrivial contour. As a result, the periodic/antiperiodic\nboundary conditions produce two different GP wave functions \u03a8+ and \u03a8\u2212 .

The second condition (18) corresponds to the absence of valencebond crystallization in the RVB construction, and, in the\ngeneral case (15), may in all probability be formulated as\nthe absence of loop crystallization. Note, however, that\nthe following discussion of those correspondences is not\nfully rigorous and some statements are indicated as conjectures.\nI begin by considering the condition (17). Under the\nassumption that that the Green's functions Gij decay\nrapidly with distance, loops of large size may appear only\n\n10\n\n14\n\n18\n\n22\n\n26\n\nL\n\nFIG. 4: The dependence of the fluctuating integrated staggered magnetization M (L) defined in Eq. (24) on the linear\nsystem size L in the log-log scale. The values of \u03b1 deduced\nfrom these data are plotted by star symbols in the inset of\nFig. 3.\n\nwith many links of short length. In this case, the change\nof boundary conditions in Eq. (13) may be represented by\nchanging the sign of the Green functions Gij intersecting\nthe reference line (Fig. 2). Consequently, the partition\nfunctions in the \u00b1 sectors may be written as\nY\nX\n(\u00b11)W\n(19)\n(\u22122Ti1 ...iln ) ,\nh\u03a8\u00b1 |\u03a8\u00b1 i =\n{Cn }\n\nn\n\nwhere W is the total winding number of the loops. This\ndefinition may be extended directly to the general formalism (15) and to any expectation value of a local observable X,\nY\nX\n(\u00b11)W X({Cn })\nA(Cn ) . (20)\nh\u03a8\u00b1 |X|\u03a8\u00b1 i =\n{Cn }\n\nn\n\nTherefore the difference between the two topological sectors (17) contains only configurations with odd winding\nnumbers. The absence of large loops then serves as a\nsufficient condition for the criterion (17) of topological\norder [I believe that in most situations this is also a necessary condition]. On the other hand, the absence of\nlarge loops also guarantees that spin correlations (14) are\nshort-ranged, but is not a necessary condition. Therefore\none may expect that in many cases the short range of spin\ncorrelations is related to the condition (17), but in this\ncontribution I provide no rigorous derivation of such a\nrelation.\nWe consider next the second condition (18). For the\nRVB wave functions represented as linear combinations\nof products of singlets, this condition corresponds to the\nabsence of singlet ordering (e.g. the absence of a valencebond crystal [17]). This can be shown by employing the\n\n\f5\neven-odd basis defined conveniently in the case of RVB\nor dimer states on a topologically non-trivial domain [13,\n18]. Using the expression (20) for the definition of \u03a8\u00b1 ,\nthe \"plus-minus\" basis is related to the \"even-odd\" basis\nby\n\u03a8\u00b1 = \u03a8e \u00b1 \u03a8o ,\n\n(21)\n\nwhere \u03a8o and \u03a8e are the states with even and odd numbers of intersections of the singlets (dimers) with the reference line (Fig. 2). The condition (18) may then be\nreformulated as\nh\u03a8e |X|\u03a8e i \u2212 h\u03a8o |X|\u03a8o i \u2192 0\n\n(22)\n\nwhich, in turn, can be interpreted as the absence of singlet (dimer) crystallization [18]. One may expect that for\nthe more general loop construction (15) this condition\nalso corresponds to the absence of loop crystallization.\nHowever I do not have a rigorous argument supporting\nthis conjecture.\nAs discussed above, the first criterion of the topological order (17) involves the question of the effective loop\nsize in the path-integral ensemble (15). This effective\nloop size cannot be inferred easily from the singlet amplitudes aij (in the case of the RVB construction) or from\nthe Green's functions Gij . Numerical studies of spin correlations in \"bosonic\" RVB states [7] indicate that the\neffective loop size may be renormalized nontrivially by\nthe constraint of fully-packed loops. Similar renormalizations of loop statistics may also be observed in the\nfermionic GP construction. I consider for illustration\none of the simplest examples of a GP wave function, the\nundoped projected d-wave state on the square lattice.\nThis state has been studied previously as an approximate\nground state of the Heisenberg antiferromagnet [19, 20].\nIt does not possess long-ranged antiferromagnetic order,\nbut only a power-law decay of antiferromagnetic correlations [6, 21]. The only dimensionless parameter in the\n \u0303 = \u2206/t, and\nwave function is the pairing strength \u2206\n \u0303\n \u0303 \u22121 (see, for\nthe wave function is invariant under \u2206 \u2192 \u2206\nexample, Ref. 19). Equivalently, the same wave function may be defined as the projected normal staggered \u0303\nflux state with a flux per plaquette of \u03c6 = 4 arctan \u2206\n[14, 15, 22]. Numerical Monte Carlo simulations indicate\nthat for all values of the parameter \u03c6, the antiferromagnetic correlations obey the power law,\n(\u22121)i\u2212j hSz (i)Sz (j)i \u221d |i \u2212 j|\u2212\u03b1 ,\n\ncondition (18) [the condition (17) was not considered for\nthis state]. Note that in the current example (undoped\nprojected d-wave state) the spin correlations (23) probe\nprecisely the probability of the two sites i and j belonging to the same loop: the Green's functions Gij connect\nonly sites of opposite antiferromagnetic sublattices, and\ntherefore the term (\u22121)Pij in (14) is equal to (\u22121)i\u2212j\nindependently of the loop configuration.\nThe actual value of the exponent \u03b1 in the power law\n(23) remains a subject of controversy. One possible scenario is the universal value of \u03b1 depending only on the\nsymmetries of the wave function (for example, the authors of Ref. 23 propose the value \u03b1 = 3/2). However,\nmy numerical results suggest a different possibility: a\nparameter-dependent non-universal exponent \u03b1(\u03c6). The\nvalues \u03b1(\u03c6) extracted from the spatial decay of spin correlations are shown in the inset of Fig. 3. To verify those\nresults, I have also computed the square of the integrated\nstaggered magnetization in the L \u00d7 L system,\n#2\n\"\n1 X\ni\n(\u22121) Sz (i) i .\nM (L) = 2 h\nL\ni\n\n(24)\n\nThe dependence of M (L) on the linear system size L is\nplotted in Fig. 4 for three values of \u03c6. A simple scaling\nargument predicts M (L) \u221d L2\u2212\u03b1 . The values of \u03b1(\u03c6)\ndeduced from M (L) are plotted by star symbols in the\ninset of Fig. 3. While those results are consistent with a\n\u03c6-dependent value of \u03b1, they do not constitute a definite\nproof: a more detailed analysis of finite-size effects or an\nanalytic argument is needed to settle the issue.\nTo summarize, the GP superconducting wave functions\nadmit a loop description generalizing the conventional\nloop construction for RVB states. The role of the singlet amplitudes is played by the equal-time BCS Green's\nfunctions. The properties of topological order and fractionalization are related to the correlations of the loops,\nbut these cannot be inferred simply from the unprojected\nGreen's functions involved. Nevertheless, the loop formulation may be helpful in visualizing the RVB properties\nof the GP wave functions, and possibly for developing\nappropriate analytic approximations.\nThe author thanks G. Jackeli and B. Normand for helpful comments on the manuscript.\n\n(23)\n\nsee Fig. 3. One observes that the spin correlations decay\nvery slowly (with \u03b1 < 2), which implies that the effective\nloop size in the loop path integral (15) is of the order\nof the system size. The condition (17) of the topological\norder is therefore expected to fail. Interestingly, in Ref.\n5 this state was indeed classified as one without topological order, but on the basis of the failure of the other\n\n[1] P. W. Anderson, Science 235, 1196 (1987).\n[2] C.
