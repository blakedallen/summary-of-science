INTRODUCTION\n\nThe observed correlations between spiral galaxy luminosities (L), sizes (R) and rotation velocities (V ) have\nlong been exploited to provide insight into the largescale galaxy distribution and the nature of disk galaxies themselves. Calibrated Tully-Fisher (Tully & Fisher\n1977) scaling relations built from the distance-dependent\nL and the distance-independent V (we henceforth refer\nto this as the LV relation) have been extensively used\nas distance indicators, while scatter in L caused by deviations from the Universal expansion probe the largescale mass distribution. The tightness of the LV relation as well as that between R and V (the RV relation)\nand between R and L (the RL relation) over decades\nin mass also provide important clues to the process of\ngalaxy formation. Most theories connect the structure\nof galactic disks to that of their parent dark matter halos (e.g. Fall & Efstathiou 1980, see below), themselves\nwell-constrained by simulations of halo assembly. A careful consideration of the scaling relations in the context\namelie@mpe.mpg.de\nkristine.spekkens@rmc.ca\n1 Max\nPlanck\nInstitut\nf\u00fcr\nAstrophysik,\nKarlSchwarzschildstrasse 1, D-85748 Garching, Germany\n2 Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of Zurich,\nCH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland\n\nof galaxy formation thus probes how baryons collapse to\nform disks as well as the properties of the dark matter\nhalos that host disk galaxies.\nThe LV relation has been used routinely over the\nlast 30 years to compute distances to nearby galaxies and their peculiar velocities relative to the Hubble flow. With typical accuracies of 15 \u2212 20%, LV\ndistances have been used successfully for example to\ndetermine the 3D structure of the Virgo cluster (e.g.\nTully & Shaya 1984; Pierce & Tully 1988; Yasuda et al.\n1997; Gavazzi et al. 1999) and to compute the value of\nH0 , with accuracy comparable to cosmology experimentderived values (e.g. Giovanelli et al. 1997a; Sakai & et al.\n2000; Masters et al. 2006, hereafter M06). Because of the\nusefulness, accuracy and relative ease of measurement\nof LV distances, large galaxy samples have been assembled for this purpose at most optical and near-infrared\nwavelengths (e.g. Aaronson et al. 1982; Mathewson et al.\n1992; Willick et al. 1997; Theureau et al. 1998).\nThe SFI++ (Springob et al. 2007, hereafter S07) is a\nsample of \u223c 5000 local galaxies, one of the largest of its\nkind, and represents the culmination of 15 years worth of\nwork by Giovanelli, Haynes and collaborators (hereafter\ncollectively referred to as \"the Cornell group\") towards\nmeasuring peculiar velocities using LV distances. The\nSFI++ builds on the earlier Spiral Field I-band (SFI:\n\n\f2\n\nSaintonge & Spekkens\n\nGiovanelli et al. 1994, 1995; Haynes et al. 1999a,b), Spiral Cluster I-band (SCI: Giovanelli et al. 1997b), and Spiral Cluster I-band 2 (SC2: Dale et al. 1999a,b) samples.\nIt also includes additional data from the previously unpublished Spiral Field I-band 2 sample (SF2) and from\nthe southern hemisphere surveys of Mathewson et al.\n(1992) and Mathewson & Ford (1996), with photometry\nre-processed to match that of the other catalogs. The\nsample contains both field and cluster galaxies, mostly\nof type Sc. A subset of the cluster galaxies comprise\na template sample used to calibrate the LV relation\nvia the \"basket-of-clusters\" technique (Giovanelli et al.\n1997b, M06). The remaining catalog members comprise\nthe nontemplate sample, from which peculiar velocities\nare estimated by application of the template LV relation\n(S07).\nThe LV , RV , and RL scaling relations are also important diagnostics of galaxy formation: L is fundamentally\na tracer of stellar mass, R a tracer of disk specific angular momentum, and V a tracer of (dark + luminous)\nmass. In the standard model for galaxy formation,\ndisks form through the dissipative collapse of hot gas\nwithin the potential wells of their dark matter halos,\nconserving specific angular momentum (White & Rees\n1978; Fall & Efstathiou 1980; Dalcanton et al. 1997;\nMo et al. 1998). This scenario relates L, R and V\nof galactic disks directly to the virial properties of\ntheir parent halos, which can be reliably measured\nfrom collisionless simulations (e.g. Macci\u00f2 et al. 2008).\nThese models have been extensively applied to the LV\nrelations originally derived as distance indicators (e.g.\nMo et al. 1998; Dalcanton et al. 1997; van den Bosch\n1998; Somerville & Primack 1999; van den Bosch 2000;\nNavarro & Steinmetz 2000; Firmani & Avila-Reese\n2000) and to the RL relation to a lesser extent\n(Salpeter & Hoffman 1996; de Jong & Lacey 2000;\nGraham 2002; Shen et al. 2003; Avila-Reese et al.\n2008). They can typically be \"tuned\" to match the\nslopes, zero-points and scatters of a given relation.\nHowever, simultaneously reproducing all scaling relations and the galaxy luminosity function is a notoriously\ndifficult problem, as it involves both cosmological\ninitial conditions and the physics of star formation and\nfeedback (van den Bosch 2000; Somerville & Primack\n1999; Bell et al. 2003; Croton et al. 2006; Dutton et al.\n2007, e.g.).\nIn light of their importance in constraining galaxy\nformation models, scaling relations are now being\nconstructed specifically for this application (e.g.\nKannappan et al.\n2002;\nKauffmann et al.\n2003;\nShen et al. 2003; Zavala et al. 2003; Pizagno et al.\n2005; Courteau et al. 2007; Pizagno et al. 2007). Of\nmost relevance to the present study, Courteau et al.\n(2007, hereafter C07) and Pizagno et al. (2005, hereafter\nP05) have constructed the LRV scaling relations from\nphotometry and kinematics comparable to that in\nthe SFI++. C07 combines subsets of four extant LV\ndistance samples into a catalog of 1300 galaxies with V\nestimated from optical rotation curves, R and L derived\nfrom I-band scale-lengths and apparent magnitudes\nrespectively, as well as as an estimate of R from 2MASS\nK-band effective radii. The raw magnitudes, velocity\nwidths and scale lengths are inhomogeneous, but C07\napply the same inclination and extinction corrections\n\nto all galaxies. By contrast, P05 use a significantly\nsmaller sample of 81 disk-dominated galaxies, but with\nhomogeneously measured V from optical rotation curves,\nL from SDSS (York & et al. 2000) i-band magnitudes,\nand R from i-band scale-lengths via 2-dimensional\nbulge-disk decompositions. Additionally, they use SDSS\ng \u2212 r colors to estimate stellar masses.\nDutton et al. (2007) and Gnedin et al. (2007) apply\ngalaxy formation models to simultaneously fit the C07\nand P05 LRV relations, respectively. Both claim to\nmatch the scaling relations, their residuals and scatter\nas well as the galaxy luminosity function, but not without invoking non-standard parameters such as low massto-light ratios (Gnedin et al. 2007) or processes such as\nhalo expansion (Dutton et al. 2007). These studies have\nclearly demonstrated the need for large, homogeneous\nsamples of galaxies from which scaling relations with\nwell-understood residuals, scatters and uncertainties can\nbe derived.\nThe exponential scale-length rd of galaxy disks is\ntypically adopted as the measure of R in disk galaxy\nscaling relations. However, disk scale lengths are notoriously difficult quantities to measure.\nFor lowinclination systems (i \u2264 50\u25e6 ), tests of measured scalelength reliability typically return uncertainties of 1020% (e.g. Schombert & Bothun 1987; Byun & Freeman\n1995; de Jong 1996; MacArthur et al. 2003; Fathi et al.\n2010), while comparisons of rd reported by different authors for the same galaxy reveal a scatter of \u223c 25%\n(Knapen & van der Kruit 1991; M\u00f6llenhoff 2004). Most\nscaling relation samples contain galaxies with i & 60\u25e6\nto mitigate uncertainties in the inclination correction\nrequired to estimate V . In the optical, disks are\npartially opaque in the region where rd is measured\n(e.g. Giovanelli et al. 1994, 1995), and internal extinction is a significant additional source of uncertainty in\nthe derivation of R in the scaling relations. Recipes\nto correct rd for internal extinction exist (e.g. Byun\n1992; Byun et al. 1994; Giovanelli et al. 1994, 1995;\nGraham 2001; Masters et al. 2003; M\u00f6llenhoff et al.\n2006; Graham & Worley 2008), and imply that large\n(& 20%), uncertain (by \u223c 30%) corrections are required\neven at moderate inclinations of i \u223c 70\u25e6 .\nGiven the large and potentially systematic uncertainties in rd , it is perhaps not surprising that the scaling\nrelations constructed using this parameter show weaker\ncorrelations and larger scatters than the LV relation\n(e.g. C07, P05), and have been correspondingly less wellstudied than the latter in both the distance indicator and\ngalaxy formation contexts. It therefore seems worthwhile\nto explore other measures of R than rd , such as isophotal radii, to construct the LRV scaling relations: preliminary work by Spekkens (2005) and Saintonge et al.\n(2008) has demonstrated promise in this approach.\nWhile originally designed to compute peculiar velcocities from LV distances, the SFI++ can also be exploited\nto study the RV and RL scaling relations of Sc galaxies. In addition to well-characterized measures of L and\nV , a significant subset of SFI++ galaxies have homogeneously measured rd as well as the radius r23.5 measured\nat the \u03bcI = 23.5 mag arcsec\u22122 isophote (Haynes et al.\n1999b, S07). Detailed studies using earlier compilations\nof the catalog explore and correct for internal extinction\neffects in these parameters (Giovanelli et al. 1994, 1995).\n\n\fSFI++ disk galaxy scaling relations\nThus while the ideal approaches toward sample selection\nand parameter measurement may differ when compiling\nsamples for LV distances versus galaxy formation analyses (Pizagno et al. 2007; Avila-Reese et al. 2008, C07,\nsee also \u00a75), the size, quality and homogeneity of the\nSFI++ are unrivalled for both applications.\nIn this paper, we present the LV , RV and RL scaling\nrelations, their residuals and their scatter for a subset\nof the SFI++ template and nontemplate samples. Since\nthe LV relation has already been extensively studied by\nM06, we focus here on the RV and RL relations. We\nargue that r23.5 is superior to rd as a measure of R, and\npresent RL relations with observed scatters that are factors of \u223c 2.5\u22124 smaller than previously found. We derive\ndetailed error budgets for all relations, and estimate the\ncontribution of measurement errors to the observed scatters. We then discuss the applications RV and RL relations for measuring redshift-independent distances and\nconstraining galaxy formation models, respectively. For\nclarity, we present the mathematical details related to\nthe derivation of the SFI++ scaling relation parameters,\ntheir uncertainties, and the scaling relation error budgets in a pair of appendices. In all sections except \u00a75, we\nadopt a value of H0 = 100h\u22121 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 for distancedependent quantities.\n2. DATA\n\nWe select our sample from the SFI++ (see \u00a71). Specifically, we include all SFI++ galaxies for which radii\nat the \u03bcI = 23.5 mag arcsec\u22122 isophote and disk scalelengths have been homogeneously measured from I-band\nphotometry (Haynes et al. 1999b, S07). We treat the\ntemplate and nontemplate galaxies separately because\n(1) as discussed in \u00a74, peculiar velocities and incompleteness biases affect them differently and (2) different subsamples are appropriate for different applications.\nThroughout this paper, we refer to the 664/807 SFI++\ntemplate galaxies and 3655/4054 SFI++ nontemplate\ngalaxies that meet our selection criteria as the template\nsubsample and nontemplate subsample, respectively, and\nperform our analysis separately on each.\n2.1. Measurements, Corrections and Error Estimates\n\nAbsolute I-band magnitudes and homogenized velocity\nwidths for the SFI++ are presented in S07. The derivation of these quantities, which draws on the work of the\nCornell group over the past 15 years (Giovanelli et al.\n1994, 1995, 1997b; Haynes et al. 1999b; Catinella et al.\n2005; Springob et al. 2005; Catinella et al. 2007, M06,\nS07), is also summarized in that paper. Because these\nderivations are paramount to a rigorous computation of\nthe scatter in the scaling relations presented here, we\ncompile the relevant measurement, correction and uncertainty estimate equations in Appendices A.1 and A.2.\nWe provide a brief description of these parameters and\nthe adopted corrections in \u00a72.1.1 and \u00a72.1.2.\nA number of disk size measures are also available\nfor the template and nontemplate subsamples.\nIn\n\u00a72.1.3, we justify our choice of the radius at the \u03bcI =\n23.5 mag arcsec\u22122 isophote as the disk size and give an\noverview of its derivation. The related mathematical details are presented in Appendix A.3.\nWe follow the same prescription for computing distances to SFI++ galaxies as in S07, which we describe\n\n3\n\nin \u00a72.1.4.\n2.1.1. Luminosities\n\nLuminosities in the SFI++ are expressed in terms of\nabsolute I-band magnitudes, MI . Their derivation is explained in S07: apparent magnitudes extrapolated to 8\ndisk scale-lengths are extracted from I-band photometry\n(Haynes et al. 1999b). They are corrected for Galactic\nextinction using the values of Schlegel et al. (1998) and\ninternal extinction using the relations of Giovanelli et al.\n(1994, 1995). The type-dependent k-correction of Han\n(1992) is also applied. Absolute magnitudes are then\ncomputed using measured galaxy or cluster redshifts as\nsummarized in \u00a72.1.4. Uncertainties on MI are computed by propagating (uncorrelated) measurement errors\non the apparent magnitude and Galactic and internal extinction corrections. The mathematical details of these\ncomputations, first presented in a series of papers by\nthe Cornell group (Giovanelli et al. 1997b; Haynes et al.\n1999b, M06, S07), are compiled in Appendix A.1.\n2.1.2. Rotation Velocities\n\nRotation velocities in the SFI++ are expressed in\nterms of the logarithm of the velocity width, log W ,\nand are presented in S07. As explained in that paper,\nlog W is derived from either single-dish HI profiles or optical rotation curves (ORCs) as in Springob et al. (2005)\nor Catinella et al. (2005), respectively. HI widths are\ncorrected for instrumental broadening and turbulence,\nwhile ORC widths are measured from a parametric fit\nto the folded rotation curve and homogenized with the\nHI widths using the relations derived by Catinella et al.\n(2007). All velocity widths are corrected for cosmological stretching, and for inclination using measured I-band\nellipticities (Haynes et al. 1999b; Giovanelli et al. 1997b,\nS07). Uncertainties on log W are computed by propagating (uncorrelated) measurement errors on the velocity width and ellipticity, as well as on the intrinsic axial ratio of the disk. The mathematical details of these\ncomputations, first presented in a series of papers by\nthe Cornell group (Giovanelli et al. 1997b; Haynes et al.\n1999b; Springob et al. 2005; Catinella et al. 2005, 2007,\nM06, S07), are compiled in Appendix A.2.\n2.1.3. Sizes\n\nAs discussed in \u00a71, deprojected disk scale-lengths rd are\ndifficult to reliably measure despite their widespread use\nto construct scaling relations: the value of rd extracted\nfrom the surface brightness profile depends on the subjective process of choosing the profile's exponential region (\"marking the disk\"), and extinction corrections applied to rd are large and uncertain (e.g. Giovanelli et al.\n1994, 1995).\nGiven these effects, it is clear that\nthe actual uncertainty in extinction-corrected rd is\nmuch larger than the \u223c 15% measurement errors that\nare generally assigned (e.g. Schombert & Bothun 1987;\nByun & Freeman 1995; de Jong 1996; MacArthur et al.\n2003; Fathi et al. 2010).\nWe therefore adopt the isophotal radius r23.5 measured\nat the \u03bcI = 23.5 mag arcsec\u22122 isophote as the SFI++\nmeasure of disk size. This quantity is straightforward\nto measure homogeneously from the high-quality SFI++\nphotometry (Haynes et al. 1999b, see also Courteau\n\n\f4\n\nSaintonge & Spekkens\n\nFig. 1.- Ratio of the measured disk scale-length rd to the isophotal radius r23.5 (computed using eq. A23) as a function of MI for\nthe nontemplate subsample. The points show the median ratio\nin equally populated absolute magnitude bins, and their errorbars\nrepresent the uncertainties on the position of the median determined by bootstrapping. The solid line shows the best linear fit to\nthe points.\n\n1996), and does not require marking the disk. It is measured at a location far enough from the bulge that the latter does not contribute significantly to the light. Its inclination dependence was studied by Giovanelli et al. (1994,\n1995): they found that galaxies with MI > \u221221 mag are\ncompletely transparent at \u03bcI = 23.5 mag arcsec\u22122, making the extinction correction also straightforward.\nWe define the isophotal radius that we adopt for the\nSFI++ disk size as R23.5 in units of h\u22121 kpc, and express it logarithmically. We present a detailed derivation of log R23.5 in Appendix A.3. Briefly, the radius\ncorresponding to the \u03bcI = 23.5 mag arcsec\u22122 isophote\nis measured from I-band photometry as described by\nHaynes et al. (1999b). The same Galactic extinction and\nk-corrections adopted to compute MI (\u00a72.1.1) are then\napplied, and the resulting values are corrected for cosmological surface brightness dimming and cosmological\nstretching. We then correct for internal extinction using the relations derived by Giovanelli et al. (1995), and\nconvert from angular to physical sizes using the measured\ngalaxy or cluster redshifts as explained in \u00a72.1.4.\nFollowing the approach of Giovanelli et al. (1997b), we\nderive uncertainties for each value of log R23.5 by propagating uncorrelated measurement uncertainties. Specifically, we include uncertainties on the raw isophotal radii,\ndisk scale-lengths, Galactic and internal extinction correction, as well as the measured uncertainties on the disk\nellipticity.\nFig. 1 shows the ratio of rd to r23.5 (the latter given\nby eq. A23) as a function of MI for the nontemplate\nsubsample. As explained by Giovanelli et al. (1995), the\ndependence of rd /r23.5 on MI stems from the systematic change of disk central surface brightnesses with this\nquantity. The solid line in Fig. 1 is the best linear fit to\nthe median values indicated by the points:\nrd\nh\ni = 0.672 + 0.0206(MI \u2212 5 log h) .\n(1)\nr23.5\nWe multiply R23.5 by this relation to convert our disk\nsizes to scale-length units when comparing with previous\nstudies (\u00a73) and galaxy formation models (\u00a75.2).\n2.1.4. Distances\n\nFollowing M06 and S07, we adopt different values of\nthe CMB-frame redshift cz in the computation of MI and\nlog R23.5 for the template and nontemplate subsamples.\nFor the template subsample, \"in\" galaxies are assigned cz\nof their parent cluster measured by M06, while distances\nto \"in+\" galaxies are computed from cz measured for\neach galaxy assuming pure Hubble flow (see M06 for the\ndefinition of \"in\" and \"in+\"). For the nontemplate subsample, distances are computed from cz for each galaxy,\nassuming pure Hubble flow.\nNote that S07 compute peculiar velocities for nontemplate SFI++ galaxies, which they take as the offset between MI and the template LV relation from M06. However, only part of the scatter in this relation stems from\npeculiar velocities (see \u00a74), which implies that the values\ncomputed by S07 are upper limits. We therefore assume\npure Hubble flow for our nontemplate subsample galaxies, and treat peculiar velocities as a source of intrinsic\nscatter in the relations.\n3. SCALING RELATIONS IN THE SFI++\n\nWe now construct LV , RV and RL scaling relations\nfor SFI++ template and nontemplate subsamples.\n3.1. The LV , RV , and RL Relations\nFigures 2 and 3 show the LV , RV , and RL relations\nfor the template and nontemplate subsamples defined in\n\u00a72, respectively. All scaling relations were modeled using an orthogonal linear fitting method which takes into\naccount measurements on x and y simultaneously. A reliable estimate of the scatter \u01ebobs in the y-axis variable\nabout the best-fitting linear relation is computed by applying Tukey's biweight to derive a robust measurement\nof the dispersion3 . The best-fitting orthogonal relations\nand 2\u01ebobs intervals are plotted as solid and dotted lines\nin each panel of the figures, and the corresponding fit\nparameters are given in Table 1.\nThe morphological corrections in eqs. 2, 3 and 4 have\nbeen applied to all of the relations in Figs. 2 and 3 (see\n\u00a73.2). They are therefore representative of Sc galaxies\nspecifically. We present the best-fitting linear relations to\nboth the uncorrected and corrected relations in Table 1.\nAs a simple measure of the tightness of the relations, the\nPearson correlation coefficient r is computed in each case\nand is also given in Table 1, as well as in the top-right\ncorner of each panel in Figs. 2 and 3.\nThe top cross in the bottom-right corner of each panel\nin Figs. 2 and 3 shows the median measurement uncertainty \u01ebmes in the sample, and the cross below it shows\nthe median \u00b1 3 times the median absolute deviation of\nthat distribution. We discuss the sources of scaling relation scatter in detail in \u00a74; for now, we point out that, as\nfound in many previous studies, \u01ebobs easily exceeds the\nmedian \u01ebmes .\nThere is a tight linear correlation between L and\nV in the SFI++; we refer the reader to M06 for\nan exhaustive discussion of the SFI++ LV relation.\nFor the entire SFI++ template sample, M06 derived\nan incompleteness-corrected, morphology-corrected template LV relation parametrized by MI \u2212 5 log h =\n3 In the case of an outlier-free, Gaussian distribution this approach reduces exactly to the classical standard deviation, but in\nthe presence of strong outliers it provides much more stable results.\n\n\fSFI++ disk galaxy scaling relations\n\n5\n\nFig. 2.- Scaling relations for the SFI++ template subsample: (a) the luminosity-velocity (LV ) relation, (b) the size-velocity (RV )\nrelation and (c) the size-luminosity (RL) relation. The morphological corrections of eqs. 4, 2 and 3 have been applied in panels (a), (b)\nand (c) respectively. In each panel the best orthogonal linear fit is plotted as a solid line, and the 2\u03c3 scatter 2\u01ebobs in the y-axis variable\nabout that fit is delimited by dotted lines. The Pearson correlation coefficient of each relation is given in the top-left corner of each panel.\nThe crosses in the bottom-right corner of each panel show the median measurement uncertainty in the sample (top) and the the median\nuncertainty \u00b1 3 times the median absolute deviation of this quantity. In (a), the dashed line and shaded region shows the SFI++ template\nLV relation derived by M06 and the dot-dashed line the relation of Sakai & et al. (2000). A color version of this figure is available in the\nelectronic edition of the Journal.\n\n\u221220.85 \u2212 7.85(log W \u2212 2.5). This relation and its median\nscatter are shown in Fig. 2a as the dashed line and shaded\nregion. The M06 relation is slightly shallower than the\none derived here due to small differences in sample composition: our template subsample contains only \u223c 80%\nof the galaxies used by M06 (see \u00a72).\nWe note that M06 correct the SFI++ LV template for\nincompleteness, an effect that biases its slope low and its\nzero point high because we are more likely to detect the\nbrighter galaxies near the flux limit of a survey (thus at\nlow V ). We do not correct the template subsample used\nhere for incompleteness. As a cursory investigation of\nthe impact of incompleteness on our sample, we fit the\nLV relation only to galaxies with log W > 2.4, which\nM06 demonstrate are unaffected by incompleteness in\n\nthe SFI++ template (see also \u00a74.1.2). As expected, the\nre-fitted relation has a steeper slope and brighter zero\npoint, pulling it farther away from the M06 result shown\nin Fig. 2a. Nonetheless, the slope and zero point of this\nre-fitted LV relation are consistent with those in Table 1\nwithin their errors. At least for the LV relation, incompleteness therefore does not produce a strong bias\nrelative to the uncertainties in our linear fits, in part because of the smaller sample adopted here compared to\nM06 (and thus the larger statistical uncertainties). We\ndiscuss the effect of incompleteness on the scaling relation scatter in \u00a74.\nTaking similarities in sample selection, photometric\nband and parameter measurement into account, it is\nmost straightforward to compare our nontemplate sub-\n\n\f6\n\nSaintonge & Spekkens\n\nFig. 3.- Same as Fig. 2, but for the SFI++ nontemplate subsample. The long-dashed lines and light (blue) shaded regions show the\nbest-fitting relations and (2\u03c3) scatter determined by C07, and the dash-dotted lines and dark (yellow) shaded regions show the best-fitting\nrelations and scatter determined by P05. The parameters in these studies are converted to our notation as described in the text. A color\nversion of this figure is available in the electronic edition of the Journal.\n\nsample relations with the results of P05 and C07. The\nbest-fitting relations and 2\u03c3 scatters from those studies\nare overplotted on our nontemplate relations in Fig. 3.\nTo carry out the comparison, luminosities are converted\nto magnitudes assuming M\u2299,I = 4.19, and we correct for\nthe slight difference in photometric band of the P05 analysis using log LI = log Li + 0.036 (C07). We change from\nrotation velocities to velocity widths by multiplying by\ntwo. Finally, we convert from the scale-length units used\nin P05 and C07 to the isophotal radius units adopted here\nusing the relation in eq. 1. Considering the differences in\nsample selection and parameter estimation, there is reasonable agreement between the best-fitting LV relation\nand scatter found here and those of P05 and C07 (dashdotted and long-dashed lines in Fig. 3, respectively).\nWe also find strong correlations between R and both V\nand L in the SFI++. Fig. 3 shows that when converted\nto our units, the best-fitting C07 relations agree very well\n\nwith ours. This is expected given the significant overlap\nbetween the samples, but reassuring to confirm because\nof the different parameters and corrections adopted in\nboth studies. By extension from the discussion in C07\nand more recent studies, there is broad general agreement between our best-fitting relations and others in\nthe literature (de Jong & Lacey 2000; Shen et al. 2003;\nGraham & Worley 2008; Fathi et al. 2010). As suggested\nby Dutton et al. (2007), the systematically larger scalelengths found by P05 may stem from differences in galaxy\nselection and parameter derivations relative to other\nstudies, and is likely exacerbated by their small sample.\nIn contrast to the similarity between our best-fitting\nRV and RL slopes and zero points and those in the literature, the high correlation coefficients of our relations\n(Table 1) provide the first indication that they are significantly tighter than has been previously reported: for\nexample, we measure r = 0.84 and r = 0.97 for the RV\n\n\fSFI++ disk galaxy scaling relations\nand LV relations in the nontemplate subsample, while\nC07 measure an average of r \u223c 0.65 for the analogous\nrelations.\nFig. 3 illustrates how the scatter in our best-fitting RV\nand RL relations (particularly the latter) is significantly\nsmaller than that reported by P05 and C07. Focussing on\nthe more widely studied RL relation, we find an average\nscatter of \u01ebobs = 0.05 log(h\u22121 kpc) for both the template\nand nontemplate subsamples (Table 1). Converted to our\nunits, C07 report a scatter of \u03c3logR \u223c 0.14 log(h\u22121 kpc)\nusing a sample that is similar to and overlaps with the\nSFI++ in many respects. P05 emphasize their small,\nwell-characterized measurement uncertainties in their homogeneous sample of 81 galaxies, and report an RL scatter identical to that of C07. Avila-Reese et al. (2008)\nstate that their heterogeneous sample of 76 galaxies\nspans a broad range of morphological types and surface brightnesses; they find \u03c3logR \u223c 0.20 log(h\u22121 kpc) for\nthe RL relation. Shen et al. (2003) study the RL relation for a statistically complete sample of \u223c 100 000\nlate-type galaxies from the SDSS, selected using cuts\nin light concentration and S\u00e9rsic index. They report\n\u03c3logR \u223c 0.13 log(h\u22121 kpc) at the high-luminosity end of\ntheir relation (late and early types are likely mixed at the\nlow-luminosity end; see Graham & Worley 2008). We\ntherefore find that relative to studies adopting a wide\nrange of sample selection philosophies, the average scatter in the SFI++ RL relation is factors of 2.5 \u2013 4 smaller\nthan previously reported.\nWe attribute the significantly smaller scatter in our RV\nand RL relations to our use of homogeneously measured,\nextinction-corrected isophotal radii as disk sizes instead\nof the scale-lengths used in the above studies4 . As explained in \u00a72.1.3, there are good reasons to expect that\nR23.5 can be more reliably measured and corrected than\nrd , and therefore that it should produce tighter scaling\nrelations than the latter. We carry out a detailed analysis\nof the scatter in the RL relation in \u00a74.\nFig. 4 shows the nontemplate RL relation constructed\nin exactly the same manner as in Fig 3c, except that we\nuse the SFI++ disk scale-length rd , corrected for internal extinction using the prescription of Giovanelli et al.\n(1995), instead of R23.5 . The values of r and \u01ebobs of that\nrelation (including all galaxy types) are given in the topleft corner of the plot. This version of the RL relation\nhas a similar r to that found by C07, and \u01ebobs that is\ncomparable to the scatters reported in the studies described above. Fig. 4 confirms: (1) the speculation by\nC07 that RV and RL relations constructed using rd are\nless robust than the LV relation because rd is not reliably measured, (2) that extinction-corrected r23.5 are\nsuperior to extinction-corrected rd when building scaling\nrelations in that the former parameter yields significantly\nstronger correlations, and (3) that the small scatter in\nour RL relations is not caused by selective \"pruning\"\nof high-scatter points in the SFI++ (Avila-Reese et al.\n2008).\n4 Shen et al. (2003) use Petrosian and S\u00e9rsic half-light radii in\ntheir study, not rd . Tests using the radius encompassing 83% of the\nI-band light for SFI++ galaxies show that integral measures also\nproduce scaling relations with more scatter than presented here\n(Saintonge et al. 2008), presumably because of the inclusion of the\nbulge light and lack of extinction correction.\n\n7\n\nFig. 4.- The RL relation for the nontemplate subsample, using\nthe extinction-corrected disk scale-length (rd ) as the size indicator\ninstead of R23.5 . The data are broken down by morphological type,\nwith lines and symbols described in Fig. 5. The best orthogonal\nlinear fit to the entire sample is given by the thick solid line, and the\nscatter 2\u01ebobs about that fit is shown by the thick dotted lines. The\nvalues of \u01ebobs and the Pearson correlation coefficient r computed\nfor the entire subsample are in the top-left corner. A color version\nof this figure is available in the electronic edition of the Journal.\n\n3.2. Morphological Dependence\nAs discussed by M06, the SFI++ contains galaxies\nwith a broader range of morphological types than earlier incarnations of the catalog, affording a more thorough investigation of scaling relations as a function morphological type. Nonetheless, the histograms in Fig. 5b\nillustrate that the SFI++ is dominated by Sc galaxies. As such, it is difficult to disentangle sample biases\nfrom physical effects in any scaling relation differences\nthat are found. We therefore follow the approach of\nGiovanelli et al. (1997b) and M06, and adjust the bestfitting scaling relations determined for galaxy types Sa\nand Sb to match that of the best-fitting Sc+Sd relations.\nWe use the larger nontemplate subsample for this exercise, and apply the derived correction to both the template and nontemplate subsamples.\nThe computed slopes, zero-points and scatters of the\nscaling relations to which these morphological corrections\nhave and have not been applied are given in Table 1.\nThere is little difference between the properties of the\nuncorrected and corrected relations: this stems from the\nhigh Sc fraction in the SFI++. For this reason, none\nof the conclusions in our study are affected by our application of the correction. The morphological dependence of the LV relation has been extensively discussed\nin the literature (e.g. Roberts 1978; Aaronson & Mould\n1983; Rubin et al. 1985; Giraud 1986a; Pierce & Tully\n1988; Kannappan et al. 2002, C07). That of the SFI++\nLV relation in particular has already been addressed by\nGiovanelli et al. (1997b) and M06. We therefore focus\non the morphological dependence of the RL relation, and\nprovide corrections for the LV and RV relations using\nthe same method.\nFig. 5a shows the RL relations for nontemplate galaxies of different morphological types, as classified in Tables 2 and 4 of S07. Note that for clarity, we only plot\na random subset of 100 galaxies of each morphological\nclass. The lines in Fig. 5a show the best orthogonal linear fits to galaxies of each morphological type. We detect\na clear trend: at a given L, early-type spirals have smaller\nR than late-type spirals, and the slope of the early-type\nRL relation is steeper. This trend is qualitatively simi-\n\n\f8\n\nSaintonge & Spekkens\nTABLE 1\nOrthogonal Fit Parameters for SFI++ Scaling Relations\nRelation\na \u00b1 \u03b4a\n\nTemplate\nb \u00b1 \u03b4b\n\n\u03c3\n\nr\n\na \u00b1 \u03b4a\n\nNon-template\nb \u00b1 \u03b4b\n\n\u03c3\n\nr\n\n\u22129.07 \u00b1 0.02\n1.357 \u00b1 0.004\n\u22120.165 \u00b1 0.001\n\n0.54\n0.11\n0.05\n\n0.87\n0.83\n0.97\n\n\u22129.42 \u00b1 0.01\n1.407 \u00b1 0.005\n\u22120.164 \u00b1 0.000\n\n0.53\n0.11\n0.05\n\n0.88\n0.84\n0.97\n\nNO MORPHOLOGICAL CORRECTION\nLV a :\nRV b :\nRLc :\n\n\u221220.83 \u00b1 0.17\n0.911 \u00b1 0.037\n0.763 \u00b1 0.028\n\n\u22128.79 \u00b1 0.04\n1.281 \u00b1 0.011\n\u22120.159 \u00b1 0.001\n\nLV a :\nRV b :\nRLc :\n\n\u221220.88 \u00b1 0.15\n0.927 \u00b1 0.038\n0.774 \u00b1 0.029\n\n\u22129.24 \u00b1 0.04\n1.353 \u00b1 0.011\n\u22120.160 \u00b1 0.001\n\n0.55\n0.11\n0.05\n\n0.91\n0.84\n0.96\n\n\u221220.77 \u00b1 0.07\n0.910 \u00b1 0.015\n0.763 \u00b1 0.016\n\nWITH MORPHOLOGICAL CORRECTION\n\na\nb\nc\n\n0.55\n0.11\n0.05\n\n0.91\n0.85\n0.97\n\n\u221220.81 \u00b1 0.06\n0.922 \u00b1 0.019\n0.773 \u00b1 0.012\n\nThe LV relation is parametrized as MI \u2212 5 log h = a + b(log W \u2212 2.5).\nThe RV relation is parametrized as log R [h\u22121 kpc] = a + b(log W \u2212 2.5).\nThe RL relation is parametrized as log R [h\u22121 kpc] = a + b(MI + 20).\n\nlar to that found by Shen et al.

This difference stems from our definition of R: the lines in Fig. 4\nshow the best-fitting relations constructed with rd for different morphological types, where we recover a strong dependence. The systematic variation of hrd /r23.5 i in Fig. 1\ncan explain at least part of the difference in morphological dependence between these two indicators: relative\nto rd , r23.5 is systematically larger for brighter galaxies,\nwhich are more likely to be Sa's according to Fig. 5b.\nThis works to offset the strong trend found when rd is\nused to construct the RL relation. However, we cannot rule out systematic effects in how rd is measured in\nSa's relative to Sc's, such as a bias in the manner that\nSa disks are marked given their more substantial bulges\n(see \u00a72.1.3).\nWe derive the morphological corrections to the RV and\nLV relations in an analogous manner to that for the RL\nrelation:\n(\n0.77 \u2212 0.25(log W \u2212 2.5) for types S0a/Sa\n\u2206RV = \u22120.13 + 0.06(log W \u2212 2.5) for types Sab/Sb\n0.0\nfor later types.\n(3)\n(\n\u22121.24 + 0.31(log W \u2212 2.5) for types S0a/Sa\n\u2206LV = 2.54 \u2212 1.01(log W \u2212 2.5) for types Sab/Sb\n0.0\nfor later types.\n(4)\nThe small difference between the correction in eq. 4 and\nthat from M06 is likely due to the fitting techniques (bi-\n\nFig. 5.- a) RL relation for the nontemplate subsample, subdivided by morphological type.

Scaling Relation Residuals\nThe residuals of the scaling relations provide useful\nchecks on data quality as well as important insight into\nthe nature of the the relations themselves. Here, we exploit the large size of the nontemplate subsample to examine the residuals of the scaling relations presented in\n\u00a73.1.\nFig. 6 plots the data-model residuals of the LV , RV\nand RL relations as a function of I-band central surface\nbrightness \u03bc0 (derived as in Haynes et al. 1999b) and the\nthird scaling relation parameter. In all panels, the residual is computed in the variable on the y-axis in Fig. 3.\nWe find no significant correlations between any of the\n\n\fSFI++ disk galaxy scaling relations\n\n9\n\nFig. 7.- Residuals of the RL relation for the nontemplate sample\nconstructed using the extinction corrected disk scale-length instead\nof R23.5 (Fig. 4), plotted against the I-band central surface brightness. The best-fitting linear relation is shown by the solid line, and\nis given in the bottom-right corner.\n\nFig. 6.- Data - model residuals of the scaling relations for the\nnontemplate subsample, plotted as a function of central I-band\nsurface brightness (a, b, c) and the third scaling parameter (d, e,\nf ), namely R for the LV relation, L for the RV relation and V for\nthe RL relation. In all panels, contours show the distribution of\nall datatpoints. The red points show the median value in equally\npopulated bins, with errorbars representing the 1\u03c3 spread in the\ndistribution of values.\n\nscaling relation residuals and these parameters. We have\nalso checked for correlations with variables such as inclination that might imply biases in our samples, and find\nnone.\nThe lack of correlation between the residuals of the\nLV relation and \u03bc0 has been extensively discussed in\nthe literature (Sprayberry et al. 1995; Zwaan et al. 1995;\nCourteau & Rix 1999; Firmani & Avila-Reese 2000;\nvan den Bosch 2000; Kannappan et al. 2002). It is generally interpreted as evidence in favor of sub-maximal disks\n(e.g. Bershady et al. 2010), but Dutton et al. (2007)\ndemonstrate that a variety of factors can alter the surface brightness dependence of the LV relation (see also\nFirmani & Avila-Reese 2000; van den Bosch 2000).\nOn the other hand, the lack of correlation between the\nresiduals of the RL and RV relations and \u03bc0 is not typical of past survey results. The reason is again our definition of R: Fig. 7 shows that we recover a strong surface brightness correlation when the extinction-corrected\nscale-length is used as the measure of disk size in the\nRL relation, with a slope consistent with that reported\nby C07. In analogy to the morphological dependence\ndiscussed in \u00a73.2, the change in hrd /r23.5 i as a function of L in Fig. 1 can also explain the lack of correlation when R23.5 is used to construct the RL relation: brighter, higher surface brightness disks have lower\nhrd /r23.5 i, which reconciles Fig. 7 and Fig. 6c. However,\nit is also possible that systematic effects related to the\nmeasurement of rd and \u03bc0 (the latter an extrapolation of\nthe exponential disk defined by the former) also influence\nthe trend in Fig. 7.\nFinally, we investigate the correlation between the scaling relation residuals, shown in Fig. 8. The axis labels in\nFig. 8 reflect the definition of the residuals: for example,\n\n\u2206LR on the y-axis of Fig. 8a are the residuals of the\nRL relation, computed as data - model residuals in L,\nwhereas \u2206RL on the y-axis of Fig. 8b are the residuals\nof the RL relation, computed as data - model residuals\nin R. Figs 8a, 8b and 8c therefore correspond to the LV ,\nRV and RL relation in differential form.\nAs in P05 and C07, we find little evidence for a correlation between the LV and RL relation residuals in Fig. 8b.\nCourteau & Rix (1999) argue that this lack of correlation\nsuggests that even high surface brightness galaxies have\nsubmaximal disks. However, the models of Gnedin et al.\n(2007) and Dutton et al. (2007) demonstrate that factors such as bulge formation, stellar and gas fractions,\nscatter in halo properties and disk mass-to-light ratios\nalso influence the behavior of the residuals. We find a\nweak positive correlation between the RL and RV relation residuals, and a strong positive correlation between\nthe LV and RV relation residuals, whose slopes are in\nrough agreement with those of the actual LV and RV\nrelations, respectively. As explained in C07, these results are qualitatively consistent with little scatter in L\nand uncorrelated scatter in V and R. The error budget\nanalysis in \u00a74 supports these conclusions for the measurement errors in V , L and R, but the substantial intrinsic\nscatter in all of the relations requires detailed modeling\nin order to fully characterize the origin of the residual\ncorrelations.\n4. ERROR BUDGETS OF THE SCALING RELATIONS\n\nAn understanding of the observed scaling relation scatter \u01ebobs is essential for reconstructing largescale structure from extracted peculiar velocities (e.g.\nSandage & Tammann 1975; Giraud 1986b; Dale et al.\n1999a) as well as for modeling the origin of the relations themselves (e.g. Dutton et al. 2007; Gnedin et al.\n2007, see \u00a71). In the same spirit as the analyses carried\nout by Giovanelli et al. (1997b) and M06 for the SFI++\ntemplate LV relation, we compute the error budgets for\nboth the template and nontemplate LV , RV and RL\nrelations presented in \u00a73.\nThe total observed scatter in the scaling relations, \u01ebobs ,\nis a combination of the measurement uncertainties \u01ebmes\nand \u01ebint , the intrinsic scatter:\n\u01eb2obs = \u01eb2mes + \u01eb2int\n\n(5)\n\nFor each relation, \u01ebmes is computed from the measure-\n\n\f10\n\nSaintonge & Spekkens\n\nFig. 8.- Correlations between the residuals of the LV , RV and RL relations for the SFI++ nontemplate subsample. The axis labels\ndenote how the residual is defined in each case: for example, \u2206LR in (a) are data - model residuals in L computed from the RL relation,\nwhereas \u2206RL in (b) are data - model residuals in R computed from the RL relation. Panels (a), (b) and (c) therefore represent the LV ,\nRV and RL relations in differential form, respectively. In each panel, the Pearson correlation coefficient of the residuals is in the top-left\ncorner, the solid lines are the best-fitting linear relations to the residuals, and their slope is in the bottom-right corner. The dashed lines\nrepresent the slope of the corresponding scaling relation from Fig. 3.\n\nFig. 9.- Error budget of the LV relation for the SFI++ template\n(a) and nontemplate (b) subsamples. Data points are the median\nobserved scatter (\u01ebobs ) as a function of V , and the error bars are\nthe uncertainty on the position of the median. The separate contributions to the total scatter are: the measurement error on L\n(\u01ebL , dotted line), the measurement error on V (|b| \u01ebW , dash-dotted\nline), which add in quadrature to produce the light solid line (i.e.\nneglecting the contribution of correlated errors). The total measurement error \u01ebmes \u2261 \u01ebLV (eq. B2, lower dark solid line) accounts\nfor correlated measurement uncertainties and, for the nontemplate\nsubsample (b), the contribution of a peculiar velocity of amplitude\nVpec = 300 km s\u22121 (\u01ebLV,V pec , dashed line). The solid line that\ngoes through the points at log W > 2.4 is the sum in quadrature\nof \u01ebLV and of a constant intrinsic scatter \u01ebint . A color version of\nthis figure is available in the electronic version of the Journal.\n\nment uncertainty on the two scaling parameters and their\ncovariance. We also include a contribution from the morphological corrections of \u00a73.2. The mathematical details\nof the derivation of \u01ebmes for the three scaling relations\ncan be found in Appendix B.\n4.1. The LV and RV relations\nFigures 9 and 10 show the total scatter of the LV\nand RV relations as a function of V for both SFI++\nsubsamples. We note that our estimates of \u01ebmes (dashdotted and dotted lines) for each variable are similar to that reported in other studies (e.g. Dutton et al.\n2007; Gnedin et al. 2007), and that accounting for correlated uncertainties does not significantly change \u01ebmes\n(lower dark and light solid lines; see also Giovanelli et al.\n1997b).\n\nFig. 10.- Error budget of the RV relation for the SFI++ template (a) and nontemplate (b) subsamples. Lines and symbols are\nas in Fig. 9. A color version of this figure is available in the electronic version of the Journal.\n\nIn all cases, the amount of scatter is almost constant\nat log W & 2.4, but increases at lower V . Above this\nthreshold, \u01ebobs can be very well reproduced by adding\na constant intrinsic scatter \u01ebint in quadrature with \u01ebmes\n(\u01ebLV and \u01ebRV ; the red line in each panel).\nThe value of \u01ebint required to match \u01ebobs at log W >\n2.4 for the template and nontemplate subsamples are\nbroadly consistent, and we attribute the slightly larger\nvalue in the template case to a small peculiar velocity\neffect in that subsample (see 4.1.1). Using the values\nderived from the nontemplate subsample, which benefits from much better statistics, we adopt intrinsic scatters \u01ebLV,int = 0.35 \u00b1 0.01 mag and \u01ebRV,int = 0.084 \u00b1\n0.001 log(h\u22121 kpc) for the LV and RV relations, respectively.\nOur value of \u01ebLV,int is similar to that invoked by M06\nin their error budget of the SFI++ template LV relation, although they fit for a width-dependent scatter including points with log W < 2.4. That solution is perfectly consistent with our error budget of Fig. 9a, but\nthe cleaner view provided by the large nontemplate subsample (Fig. 9b) makes us favor the constant scatter approach.\nAs for the deviation from constant intrinsic scatter\n\n\fSFI++ disk galaxy scaling relations\nat low V in Figs. 9 and 10, we identify four possible\ncauses: peculiar velocities, sample incompleteness, increased measurement errors and increased intrinsic scatter. We investigate these possibilities in turn below.\n4.1.1. Peculiar velocities\n\nPeculiar velocities introduce scatter in both the LV\nand RV relations. Because distances to nontemplate\ngalaxies are derived assuming pure Hubble flow, the effect will be strongest in that subsample. While peculiar\nvelocities in clusters are larger than in the field, the template sample is mostly free of peculiar velocity-induced\nscatter, because we adopt cluster distances for all their\nmembers (see \u00a72.1.4).\nThe median redshift cz of the galaxies in the nontemplate subsample is a strong function of V . Since a galaxy\nat redshift cz with peculiar velocity Vpec will scatter away\nfrom the mean LV and RV relations in proportion to\nlog(1 + Vpec /cz) (see Appendix B), the effect of peculiar\nvelocities on the scatter in these relations is strongest at\nlow V , where cz is smallest.\nTo assess the impact of peculiar velocities, we compute\nthe scatter produced in the LV and RV relations by a\ncharacteristic Vpec = 300 km s\u22121 and cz as a function of V\nin the nontemplate subsample. The result is illustrated\nby the dashed lines in Figs. 9b and 10b. At the lowV end of the nontemplate relations, peculiar velocities\ncan constitute the largest source of scatter. The lower\ndark solid line in these figures adds this contribution to\nthe scatter in quadrature with \u01ebmes . The resulting is a\nsteepening of the total measurement error curve at low V .\nHowever, it is clear that peculiar velocities alone cannot\nexplain the increase in \u01ebobs in the LV and RV relations\nat low V .\n4.1.2. Sample incompleteness\n\nIn addition to biasing scaling relation slopes and zero\npoints (see \u00a73.1), statistical incompleteness of a sample\ncan also affect their scatter. Cluster samples are often\nused for scaling relation studies because they are less\naffected by incompleteness than flux-limited field samples. Nonetheless, Giovanelli et al. (1997b) and M06\nhave shown that the SFI++ template subsample suffers\nfrom incompleteness at log W . 2.5 (e.g. Fig. 4 in M06).\nThe nontemplate subsample certainly also suffers from\nincompleteness. However, the union of several disparate\nsamples to create the SFI++ makes it impossible to derive the selection function of the survey and quantify\nits incompleteness (see \u00a71 and the discussion in S07).\nIt is nonetheless reasonable to assume that the qualitative impact of incompleteness mirrors that determined by\nM06 (see also de Jong & Lacey 2000). Since we are more\nlikely to observe larger/brighter galaxies near the survey\nlimits, the scatter at the low-V end of the relations is\nreduced. However, we observe an increase in \u01ebobs . Thus\nunless incompleteness in our SFI++ subsamples behaves\nin the opposite manner from that determined by M06 for\nthe SFI++ template LV relation, it is unlikely to explain\nthe increase in \u01ebobs at log W . 2.4 in Figs. 9 and 10.\n4.1.3. Increased scatter in V\n\nContrary to the LV and RV relations, \u01ebobs in the RL\nrelation does not increase at low L (see \u00a74.2 and Fig. 11).\n\n11\n\nFor this reason, we associate the behavior of the scatter\nat low V in the LV and RV relations to V itself. Here,\nwe investigate the possibility that there is an additional\ncontribution to the scatter in V for which we have not\naccounted in our error budget.\nPart of the increased scatter could come from measurement uncertainties specific to galaxies with low V .\nGalaxies with narrower HI lines are more prone to\n\"catastrophic\" measurement errors due to, for example,\nline asymmetries and turbulence effects (Springob et al.\n2005), or uncertainties in inclination. While it is impossible to account quantitatively for the effect of these\ncatastrophic errors on our scaling relations, it is plausible that they produce a total measurement error function\n(\u01ebLV , \u01ebRV ) that is steep at the low-V end. Nonetheless,\nit seems unlikely that the median fractional uncertainty\non log W at log W \u223c 2.2 is underestimated by a factor of\n4 relative to that computed in our budget, and thus that\nmeasurement errors alone explain the increase in \u01ebobs .\nWe are therefore left with the possibility that the scatter at low V stems from an astrophysical effect. For\nexample, galaxies with low V have lower masses, and are\ntherefore more susceptible to HI disk stripping processes.\nSince these galaxies tend to have rising rotation curves\n(e.g. Catinella et al. 2006), measuring V at different radii\nbecause of HI disks stripped to various degrees will introduce scatter. However, the slope of low-mass galaxy\nrotation curves is not nearly steep enough to explain the\nentirety of the increase in \u01ebobs .\nIt is possible that the behavior of \u01ebobs in the LV and\nRV relations stems from an increase in the intrinsic scatter at low V related to the properties of their stellar disks\nor their parent dark matter halos. While this is a tantalizing possibility at the outset, it is difficult to \"tune\"\ngalaxy formation models of the type described in \u00a75.2 to\nincrease the scatter in the LV and RV relations without increasing that in the RL relation (e.g. Dutton et al.\n2007). It is therefore not obvious that the increase in\n\u01ebobs at log W < 2.4 in the LV and RV relations can be\nattributed to intrinsic scatter, although a full suite of\ngalaxy formation models is needed to address this issue.\n4.2. The RL relation\nThe average \u01ebobs for the RL relation is significantly\nlower than that of the RV relation (Table 1). This comes\nin part because the measurement errors on L introduce\nless scatter than those of V , as pointed out by C07 and\nclearly seen in the error budgets of Figures 10 and 11.\nHowever, our analysis shows that the relation also has\nsignificantly less intrinsic scatter: in regions at high V\nand high L where the scatter is approximately constant,\nwe measure \u01ebRV,int = 0.084 \u00b1 0.001 log(h\u22121 kpc) for the\nRV relation but \u01ebRL,int = 0.034 \u00b1 0.001 log(h\u22121 kpc) for\nthe RL relation.\nThe overall behaviour of the scatter in the RL relation is also different: contrary to the increases found for\nthe LV and RV relations, we find a reduced scatter for\nMI \u2212 5 log h & \u221220 in the RL relation. We can rule out\npeculiar velocities affecting the scatter since they move\npoints almost exactly along the RL relation (see Appendix B). Given the discussion in \u00a74.1.2, incompleteness\nis the most likely culprit. Since some of the data included\nin the SFI++ stem from aperture diameter-limited surveys (especially among the fainter, more nearby galax-\n\n\f12\n\nSaintonge & Spekkens\n\nFig. 11.- Error budget of the RL relation for the SFI++ template (a) and nontemplate (b) subsamples. Lines and symbols are\nas in Fig. 9. In this case we do not include the contribution of\npeculiar velocities to the total scatter, because as discussed in Appendix B, they move points almost exactly along the RL relation.\nA color version of this figure is available in the electronic version\nof the Journal.\n\nies), we expect incompleteness to reduce the scatter at\nthe faint end of the RL relation in analogy the LV relation behaviour determined by M06 for the SFI++ template.\n5. APPLICATIONS OF THE RL AND RV RELATIONS\n\nIn \u00a73.1 we present RV and RL relations that exhibit significantly smaller scatter than has been previously reported, which we attribute to our adoption of an\ninclination-corrected isophotal radius as the size parameter R in these relations rather than a disk scale-length.\nHere, we discuss the implications of this reduced scatter\nfor two common scaling relation applications: redshiftindependent distances and galaxy formation models.\nWhile it is obvious that the ideal samples to be used\nas distance indicators and galaxy formation constraints\ndiffer, it is equally obvious that these ideal samples are\nnot yet available. The use of the scaling relations as either distance indicators or galaxy formation constraints\nthus requires finding an acceptable middle ground with\nrespect to sample selection. It is in this sense that subsets of the SFI++ are relevant in both the distance indicator and galaxy formation contexts. The SFI++ template sample was explicitly constructed to measure LV\ndistances (M06), and we discuss in \u00a75.1 the potential of\nexploiting our template RV relation for the same purpose. The SFI++ nontemplate galaxies span a broader\nrange of properties, and were not selectively edited for\ncosmic flows or other purposes. The mix of morphological types in the SFI++, as with most other large catalogs\nof similar quality, is not representative of that in the local Universe. On the other hand, there is no reason to\nsuspect that the SFI++ does not reflect the properties of\nSc galaxies in that volume. With this caveat in mind, we\nexplore in \u00a75.2 the implications of the small scatter in the\nnontemplate RL relation for galaxy formation models.\nNote that in this section, we adopt the WMAP5 value\n\u22121\nof H0 = 71.9+2.6\nMpc\u22121 (Dunkley et al. 2009)\n\u22122.7 km s\nfor concreteness.\n\n5.1. The RV Relation as a Distance Indicator\nSince R depends on distance while V does not, the RV\nrelation could in principle be used to produce distanceindependent redshifts just like the widely-used LV relation. This application has received little attention so far,\nbecause the RV relation typically has significant scatter.\nHowever, our RV relation is nearly as tight as the LV relation, and has \u223c 1.5 times less scatter than found in previous studies (see Figs. 2 and \u00a73). Since disk sizes can be\nmore straightforward to compute than magnitudes (and\nsometimes even more reliable), there is obvious interest\nin using the RV relation as a distance indicator.\nAs a proof of principle, we use the sample of 17 SFI++\ngalaxies with a distance measurement from Cepheid variables compiled by M06 to evaluate the distances derived\nfrom the SFI++ RV relation. We use the template subsample RV relation for this exercise, since it is less susceptible to peculiar velocities and can in principle be\ncorrected for incompleteness. The template sample in\nM06 was used to independently calibrate the zero point\nof the LV relation and to provide an estimate of H0 .\nTheir value of H0 = 74 \u00b1 2 (random) \u00b1 6 (systematic)\nkm s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 compares well with the WMAP5 result of\n\u22121\nH0 = 71.9+2.6\nMpc\u22121 (Dunkley et al. 2009). The\n\u22122.7 km s\nsystematic component of the uncertainty in the M06 estimate stems largely from the uncertainty of the Cepheid\ndistance zero point, not the LV relation (Sakai et al.\n2004).\nFig. 12 shows the RV relation for the Cepheid sample,\noverlaid on the template RV relation normalized to the\nWMAP5 value of H0 . Since most of the galaxies in the\nCepheid sample have large rotation velocities, it is not\npossible to reliably fit the slope of their RV relation.\nInstead, we adopt the slope of the template RV relation,\nbut determine the zero point of the Cepheid sample RV\nrelation independently. The 1\u03c3 region around the RV\nrelation with this Cepheid-derived zero point is shown in\nFig. 12 as the shaded region, which overlaps comfortably\nwith that derived from the template subsample (solid\nline).\nReversing the problem, the value of H0 can be determined by matching the zero points of the SFI++ template relation and that of the cosmology-independent\nvalue derived from the Cepheid sample. We find a value\nof H0 = 72 \u00b1 7 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , where the errors come\nin part from the intrinsic scatter of the RV relation but\nmostly from the uncertainty on the Cepheid distances.\nComparing the M06 estimate of H0 with this value, we\nconclude that the LV and RV relations provide similar\nconstraints on this parameter.\nFinally, the distances to the galaxies in the Cepheid\nsample are computed from the template subsample LV\nand RV relations in \u00a73.1. The relative differences between the Cepheid- and scaling relation-derived distances\nare shown in Figure 13. The typical errors on the LV and RV -derived distances are obtained by taking the median absolute deviation of these relative differences, and\nare 14.8% and 24.7%, respectively. These errors are in\nline with the typical errors of \u223c 15\u221220% generally quoted\nfor LV distances (e.g. Tully & Pierce 2000).\nThe above exercises suggest that even given the tight\nRV relation presented here, the LV relation produces\nmore accurate redshift-independent distances.

We note that a\nthorough analysis of the RV relation as a distance indicator requires a correction for incompleteness effects.\nThis is clearly feasible for the SFI++ template sample\n(Giovanelli et al. 1997b, M06), but we defer this task to\na future paper.\n5.2. The RL Relation and Galaxy Formation Models\n\nIt is clear that a simultaneous application of galaxy\nformation models to the scaling relations derived here,\nlike that carried out by Dutton et al. (2007) and\nGnedin et al. (2007), is beyond the scope of this paper.\nNonetheless, a consideration of the SFI++ RL relation\nscatter in the context of a simple model demonstrates\nthe potential of our relations to place new constraints on\ngalaxy formation. The RL relation is ideal in this context\nbecause peculiar velocities move points almost exactly\nalong the relation, and therefore do not contribute to the\nscatter (see Appendix B). We use the larger nontemplate\nsubsample for this exercise, with the morphological cor-\n\nIn eq. 6, \u03a5d is the disk mass-to-light ratio. We adopt\nthe relation derived by Dutton et al.

Few constraints exist on md\nor on its scatter at fixed M200 , but most spiral galaxy\nmass models find md \u223c 0.05. As in Dutton et al.

We tune md,0 and\n\u03b1 to match the RL relation intercept and slope, respectively.\nIn eq. 6, \u03bb\u2032 is the effective spin parameter of the system:\n\u0012\n\u0013\njd\njd J200 |E|1/2\n\u2032\n,\n(9)\n\u03bb =\n\u03bb=\n5/2\nmd\nmd\nGM200\nwhere jd is the ratio of the disk angular momentum\nJd to the halo angular momentum J200 , and \u03bb is the\nspin parameter of the halo. Collisionless simulations of\nhalo assembly find a log-normal distribution of \u03bb that\nis independent of halo mass. We adopt the distribution peak \u03bb\u0304 = 0.042 (Bullock et al. 2001) as our fiducial\nvalue for \u03bb\u2032 . The relaxed halos in the WMAP5 simulations of Macci\u00f2 et al. (2008) have a logarithmic scatter\n\u03c3log \u03bb = 0.228, which we compare to the scatter in \u03bb\u2032\nallowed by our RL relation below.\nThe parameters fc (c) and fR (\u03bb\u2032 , md , c) in eq. 6 account\nfor the difference in total energy E between an NFW and\nisothermal halo and the adiabatic contraction of the disk\nin the halo potential, respectively, where c is the halo concentration. We use the exact expression for fc in eq. 23 of\nMMW98, and the approximate expression in their eq. 32\nfor fR . Finally, we compute c as a function of Ld for\nour sample using the best-fitting linear relation between\nc and M200 for relaxed, WMAP5 halos in Macci\u00f2 et al.\n(2008) assuming W = V200 /2 (Dutton et al. 2010).\nGiven the different measures of disk size presented in\nthis paper, the definition of Rd in eq. 6 merits discussion.\n\n\f14\n\nSaintonge & Spekkens\n\nThe model in eq. 6 assumes that the (cold) baryons in\ndisk galaxies are distributed in an exponential stellar disk\nwith scale-length Rd . However, it is important to distinguish between Rd , the predicted scale-length of the stellar mass distribution, and rd , the measured scale-length\nof the projected light distribution. For the variety of\nreasons discussed in \u00a71, extracting reliable deprojected\nscale-lengths from galaxy photometry is difficult. It is\ntherefore not straightforward to relate the measured rd\nand the predicted Rd .\nFor a pure exponential disk with a fixed \u03a5d , Rd is directly related to any given isophotal radius by the disk\ncentral surface brightness \u03bc0 . If there is no scatter in\n\u03bc0 at a given Ld , then the scatter in the distribution of\nisophotal radii is identical to the scatter in Rd . Moreover,\nif the median measured rd at a given Ld is an unbiased\nestimator of Rd , then the ratio of rd to the median measured isophotal radius relates the latter directly to the\npredicted Rd .\nWhile the relationship between Rd and isophotal radii\ndescribed above clearly oversimplifies galactic structure,\nthe basic scenario meshes with the properties of the\nSFI++. That the scatter in the log R23.5 \u2212 L relation is\n2.5 \u2013 4 times smaller than that previously reported for\nthe rd \u2212 L relation (see \u00a73.1) evidences a disconnect between rd and Rd , and suggests that measured R23.5 are\nbetter proxies for theoretical Rd than measured scalelengths rd . We embrace this hypothesis in applying eq. 6\nto the nontemplate RL relation presented in \u00a73.1.\n5.2.2. Application to the RL Relation\n\nWe now proceed to tune the parameters of eq. 6 to\nmatch the RL relation for the nontemplate subsample\nin Fig. 3. We convert R23.5 to Rd using the best-fitting\nlinear relation in Fig. 1, and convert to solar luminosities\nusing M\u2299,I = 4.19. Fig. 14 shows the RL relation for the\nnontemplate subsample in these units.\nThe solid line in Fig. 14 shows eq. 6 with our fiducial\n\u03bb\u2032 = 0.042 and md,0 = 0.054, with \u03b1 = 0.14. This choice\nof parameters reproduces the slope and zero-point of the\nobserved relation, but is not unique: Dutton et al. (2007)\nand Gnedin et al. (2007) demonstrate that a simultaneous fit of the scaling relations, their scatter and their\nresiduals is required to break the degeneracies between\nparameters in eq. 6.\nNonetheless, the implications of the scatter in our RL\nrelation for this model can be made clear by considering the maximum scatter in each of the parameters of\neq. 6 that is allowed by the data. We model a constant scatter \u01ebobs (dashed lines in Fig. 14) with \u01ebmes =\n\u01ebRL = 0.04 log(h\u22121 kpc) and \u01ebint = 0.034 log(h\u22121 kpc)\n(see \u00a74.2). The maximum scatter allowed in any one\nparameter of the model in eq. 6 is therefore \u01ebint . For\nsimplicity, we assume that fR is scatter-free in this exercise. Eq. 6 shows that the maximum scatters in \u03bb\u2032\nand md allowed by the RL relation are \u01eblog \u03bb\u2032 = 0.034\nand \u01eblog md = 0.102, respectively. Since Dutton et al.\n(2007) find that the RL relation limits the allowed range\nof these parameters even when simultaneous models to\nall the scaling relations are considered, we consider these\nmaximum scatters robust.\nThis simple analysis suggests that the range of \u03bb\u2032 and\nmd in spiral galaxies is significantly smaller than previously estimated: for example, our upper limit on the\n\nFig. 14.- RL relation for the nontemplate subsample expressed\nin scale-length and luminosity units with Ho = 71.9 km s\u22121\nMpc\u22121 . The solid line through the points shows eq. 6 with parameters \u03bb\u2032 = 0.042, md = 0.054, \u03b1 = 0.14. The dashed lines show\nthe scatter 2\u01ebobs = 0.052 log(h\u22121 kpc) about that relation allowed\nby the data, and the shaded region shows in comparison the scatter expected if the distribution of disk spin parameters \u03bb\u2032 matched\nthat of the spin parameters \u03bb of collisionless halos.\n\nscatter in \u03bb\u2032 is a factor of \u223c 3 smaller than that found\nby Dutton et al. (2007), because \u01ebint in our RL relation scatter is significantly smaller than that of the one\nthey model. More importantly, \u01eblog \u03bb\u2032 is a factor of 6.7\nsmaller than \u01eblog \u03bb found from cosmological simulations\n(Macci\u00f2 et al. 2008): to illustrate, the shaded region in\nFig. 14 shows the expected scatter in the case where\n\u01eblog \u03bb\u2032 = \u01eblog \u03bb .\nIt is possible that the distribution of specific angular\nmomentum jd /md in disk galaxies has less scatter than\nthat of their host halos, perhaps due to a redistribution of\nangular momentum through bulge formation. This was\nexplored by Dutton et al. (2007), but their bulge formation scenario reduces the RL scatter by at most 15% for\nrealistic bulge-to-disk ratios. It therefore seems unlikely\nthat angular momentum redistribution is responsible for\nthe narrow range of \u03bb\u2032 required by our model, particularly for the Sc-dominated SFI++.\nAnother possibility is that disk galaxies form in a\nsubset of halos with a distribution of spin parameters\nthat is different from that in the halo population as\na whole. Some studies suggest that this is the case:\nhalos with a quiet merger history in the simulations\nof D'Onghia & Burkert (2004) have both lower \u03bb\u0304 and\n\u03c3log \u03bb than found for all halos. This possibility has been\npreviously discussed in the context of scaling relation\nmodels (e.g. de Jong & Lacey 2000; Pizagno et al. 2005;\nDutton et al. 2007; Gnedin et al. 2007). However, it is\nunclear whether this effect can explain the extremely\nsmall range of \u03bb implied by our RL relation: once the\nscatter from other parameters such as c and \u03a5d are taken\ninto account, the allowed scatter on \u03bb\u2032 may well be an order of magnitude smaller than that predicted for \u03bb from\ncosmological expectations.\n6. SUMMARY\n\nOf all the disk galaxy scaling relations, the LV (i.e.\nTully-Fisher) relation has by far received the most attention. It has been used to compute distances to galaxies\nin the nearby universe and study the local velocity field,\nand to put constraints on models of galaxy formation,\nusing data at different wavelengths and at both low and\nhigh redshift. While the RL and RV relations can in the-\n\n\fSFI++ disk galaxy scaling relations\nory serve similar purposes, the large scatter in previously\npublished versions of these relations is prohibitive.\nWith close to 5000 galaxies, the SFI++ is one of the\nlargest available samples to study disk galaxy scaling relations. The main advantage of the sample is the large\nrange of carefully measured parameters available, and\nthe well-studied uncertainties associated with them. Homogeneous rotation velocities and I\u2212band luminosities\nwere published by S07, and the SFI++ LV template relation studied in detail by M06. In addition to estimates\nof V and L, measures of disk size R are also available for\na subset of the catalog. It is therefore possible to construct the full suite of LRV scaling relations from the\nSFI++.\nIn this paper, we have presented the LV , RV and\nRL relations for subsets of the template and nontemplate SFI++ samples. Because the SFI++ LV relation\nhas been extensively studied, we focus on the RV and\nRL relations. Contrary to previous studies, we adopt\ninclination-corrected isophotal radii rather than disk\nscale-lengths as a measure of the disk size R. While scalelength-based studies report an observed scatter for the\nRL relation of \u01ebobs = 0.15\u22120.20 log(h\u22121 kpc) (Shen et al.\n2003; Avila-Reese et al. 2008, P05, C07), we find \u01ebobs =\n0.05 log(h\u22121 kpc). With \u01ebobs = 0.11 log(h\u22121 kpc) and a\ncorrelation coefficient of r = 0.86, our RV relation is also\nsignificantly tighter than previously found. We demonstrate that the drastically tighter relations and lower\nscatters reported here stem from our use of isophotal\nradii, and argue that they are superior to measured scalelengths because they are less susceptible to measurement\nerrors and can be more reliably corrected for internal extinction. We examine and interpret the morphological\ndependence of the scaling relations as well as the properties of their residuals.\nAfter carefully accounting for all known sources of\nmeasurement error and their covariances, we retrieve\nthe amount of intrinsic scatter in each of the relations.\nOur error budgets are consistent with constant intrinsic scatter \u01ebint at high L and high V , with values\n\u01ebint = 0.35 mag, \u01ebint = 0.084 log(h\u22121 kpc) and \u01ebint =\n0.034 log(h\u22121 kpc) for the LV , RV and RL relations, respectively. The scatter of the LV and RV relations however increases strongly at low V . While this likely reflects\nenhanced intrinsic scatter in V , the effect is difficult to\nquantify due to the competing contributions of peculiar\nvelocities, sample incompleteness and measurement errors. On the other hand, the scatter in the RL relation\ndecreases slightly at low L, consistent with the behavior\n\n15\n\nof an incompleteness bias.\nWe investigate the possible application of the RV relation as a distance indicator. Comparing with the\nCepheid variable distances available for 17 galaxies in\nthe template subsample, we find that the RV relation\nreturns distances with a median precision of 25%. This\nis slightly inferior to the 15-20% accuracy of LV relation distances typically reported. We suggest that RV\ndistances are nonetheless accurate enough to provide a\nvalid substitute when precise integrated magnitudes are\nnot available. We find that the uncertainties on H0 derived by matching the zero points of the RV relations\nfor the template subsample and Cepheid variable sample\nare comparable to those obtained using the LV relation:\nin both cases, the uncertainties on the Cepheid distance\nzero point dominate.\nTo illustrate the potential of the SFI++ scaling relations to constrain the formation of Sc galaxies, we apply\na simple, MMW98-style galaxy formation model to the\nnontemplate RL relation. Assuming that the intrinsic\nscatter in our measured isophotal radii equals that of\nthe predicted scale-lengths of the stellar mass distribution, we find an upper limit on the scatter of the disk\nspin parameter that is 3 times smaller than previously\nreported, and 6.7 times smaller than the distribution of\nhalo spin parameters predicted by cosmological simulations. As it is unlikely that angular momentum redistribution due to bulge formation can account for this\ndifference, we suggest that the subset of halos in which\nSc galaxies form has a much smaller spread in spin parameters than the broader halo population. A separate\nanalysis will be required to quantify the full potential\nof the low-scatter SFI++ RV and RL relations for constraining galaxy formation in light of the improved size\nmeasurements presented here.\nWe thank Riccardo Giovanelli and Martha Haynes for\nadvice on the contents of this paper and for kindly providing some unpublished parameters from the SFI++\ncatalog.

SFI++ SCALING RELATION PARAMETERS AND THEIR UNCERTAINTIES\n\nIn \u00a72.1, we summarize the derivation of disk luminosities and rotation velocities in the SFI++, and give an overview\nof our approach for computing homogeneous disk sizes for the sample studied here. In this appendix, we present the\nmathematical details of these computations.\nThe standard error propagation formula for a function f (x, y) is given by:\n\u0012 \u00132\n\u0012 \u00132\n\u0012 \u0013\u0012 \u0013\n\u03b4f\n\u03b4f\n\u03b4f\n\u03b4f\n2\n2\n2\n\u01ebf =\n\u01ebxy = \u03b4x2 \u01eb2x + \u03b4y2 \u01eb2y + 2\u03b4x \u03b4y \u01ebxy ,\n(A1)\n\u01ebx +\n\u01eby + 2\n\u03b4x\n\u03b4y\n\u03b4x\n\u03b4y\nand can be expanded in the expected manner for functions of larger numbers of variables. In eq. A1, \u01ebx and \u01eby are the\nuncertainties on the parameters x and y, respectively, and \u01ebxy is the covariance between them. We take covariances\n\n\fSFI++ disk galaxy scaling relations\n\n17\n\ninto account in the derivation of the SFI++ error budgets in Appendix B.\nSFI++ Disk Luminosities: Absolute I-Band Magnitudes\nDisk luminosities in the SFI++ are expressed in terms of absolute I-band magnitudes. As explained in S07, the\nSFI++ absolute magnitude derivation draws from the work of Giovanelli et al. (1997b), Haynes et al. (1999b) and\nM06; for clarity, we use the notation of S07 where possible. The absolute magnitudes MI are given by:\ni\nh cz\n(1 + z) \u2212 25,\n(A2)\nMI = mobs \u2212 AI + \u2206M + kI \u2212 5 log\n100h\nwhere mobs is the observed I-band magnitude extrapolated to 8 disk scale-lengths (Haynes et al. 1999b), AI is the\nGalactic extinction term from the COBE/DIRBE maps of Schlegel et al. (1998), and kI is a type- and redshiftdependent k-correction (Han 1992):\nkI = (0.1658T \u2212 0.5876)z .\n(A3)\n\nWe assign distances to the sample galaxies as described in \u00a72.1.4. The luminosity distance factor (1 + z) in the 5th\nterm on the right-hand side (RHS) of eq. A2, not included in earlier SFI++ compilations, accounts for cosmological\ndimming.\nThe \u2206M term in eq. A2 corrects for internal extinction, as first derived by Giovanelli et al. (1994):\n\u2206M = \u03b3 log(1 \u2212 e),\n\n(A4)\n\nwhere e = 1 \u2212 b/a is the seeing-corrected ellipticity of the disk (Giovanelli et al. 1997b; Haynes et al. 1999b) and \u03b3 is\na magnitude-dependent factor of order unity (Giovanelli et al. 1995, S07):\n\u03b3 = 0.5\n= 1 \u2212 0.417(MI + 20.3)\n= 1.0\n= 1.35 \u2212 0.35(MI + 22.8)\n= 1.3\n\nfor MI > \u221219.1\nfor \u2212 20.3 < MI < \u221219.1\nfor \u2212 21.8 < MI < \u221220.3\nfor \u2212 22.7 < MI < \u221221.8\nfor MI < \u221222.7\n\n(A5)\n\nWe note that there are differences of \u223c 0.1 mag between the MI that we compute using eq. A2 and the corresponding\nvalues listed in tables 2 and 4 of S07 (specifically, the values listed in the erratum to that paper). The two main reasons\nfor this difference are (1) MI listed in S07 have the morphological correction of M06 applied. By contrast, we only\ncorrect MI for morphology in the LV relation, in the manner described in \u00a73.2; and (2) M06 and S07 actually use\na velocity width-dependent value of \u03b3 in computing their MI , rather than their published relation in eq. A5 (K. L.\nMasters, priv. comm.). We have verified that these small differences do not affect the results presented here.\nThe measurement uncertainties \u01ebM on MI are computed as in Giovanelli et al. (1997b). Contributions from cz\n(< 1%) and kI (< 0.01 mag) are small compared to other factors, and are therefore ignored. Assuming that the\nuncertainties \u01ebm on mobs , \u01ebA on AI , \u01eb\u03b3 on \u03b3, and \u01ebe on e are uncorrelated and using eq. A1, \u01ebM is given by:\n2\n\u01eb2M = \u01eb2m + \u01eb2A + \u03b4\u03b32 \u01eb2\u03b3 + \u03b4eM\n\u01eb2e ,\n\n(A6)\n\n\u03b4\u03b3 = log(1 \u2212 e),\n\n(A7)\n\nwhere\n\u03b4eM =\n\n\u2212\u03b3\n,\nln(10)(1 \u2212 e)\n\n(A8)\n\nIn the SFI++, \u01ebmobs and \u01ebe are computed using the method of Haynes et al. (1999a), \u01eb\u03b3 = 0.15\u03b3 (Giovanelli et al.\n1997b) and \u01ebA = 0.2AI (C. M. Springob, priv. comm.).\nSFI++ Disk Rotation Velocities: Velocity Widths\nDisk rotation velocities in the SFI++ are expressed in terms of velocity widths. As explained in S07, these widths\nare homogeneously derived from either single-dish HI measurements or ORCs, with a preference for the former when\nboth are available for a given galaxy. The corrected velocity widths in the SFI++ are given by:\nW =\nwhere\nQ=\n\n(\n\nQ\n,\nsin i\n\nWobs,21 \u2212\u2206s\n1+z h \u2212 \u2206t i\nWobs,ORC\nW21\n1+z\nWORC\n\nfor HI widths,\nfor ORC widths.\n\n(A9)\n\n(A10)\n\nThe HI width measurement technique and corrections are given in Springob et al. (2005). Briefly, W21,obs in eq. A10\nis the observed width and \u2206t = 6.5 km s\u22121 is the correction for turbulent motions. The instrumental broadening is\n\n\f18\n\nSaintonge & Spekkens\n\n\u2206s = 2\u2206v\u03bb, where \u2206v is the spectrometer channel separation in km s\u22121 and the parameter \u03bb depends on the spectrum\nquality and smoothing (see table 2 of Springob et al. 2005).\nThe ORC width derivation is given in Catinella et al. (2005) and Catinella et al. (2007): as explained in those\npapers, the measured width WORC,obs in eq. A10 is the parametric Polyex model fit (Giovanelli & Haynes 2002) at the\nradius ropt containing 83% of the total I-band light. Since the HI disks of spirals typically extend to twice this value,\na correction factor W21 /WORC is applied to homogenize the HI and ORC widths:\n(\nW21\n0.899 + 0.188rmax/ropt for rising ORCs,\n=\n(A11)\n1.075 \u2212 0.013rmax/ropt for flat ORCs,\nWORC\nwhere rmax is the measured extent of the ORC.\nThe disk inclination i is computed from e using:\n(cos i)2 =\n\n(1 \u2212 e)2 \u2212 q02\n,\n1 \u2212 q02\n\n(A12)\n\nwhere the intrinsic axial ratio q0 = 0.13 for galaxies of types Sbc and later, and q0 = 0.20 for earlier types\n(Giovanelli et al. 1994, S07). Substituting for sin i using eq. A12 and adopting logarithmic units, eq. A9 can be\nrewritten as:\nlog W = log Q + 0.5 log(1 \u2212 q02 ) \u2212 0.5 log[1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 e)2 ].\n(A13)\nAssuming that the measurement uncertainties on individual parameters are uncorrelated and applying eq. A1, the net\nmeasurement uncertainty \u01ebW on log W is therefore:\n2 2\n2\n\u01eb2W \u2261 \u01eb2log W = \u03b4Q\n\u01ebQ + \u03b4q2 \u01eb2q + \u03b4eW\n\u01eb2e ,\n\nwhere\n\n1\n,\nln(10)Q\n\n(A15)\n\n\u2212q0\n,\nln(10)(1 \u2212 q02 )\n\n(A16)\n\n\u03b4Q =\n\u03b4q =\n\u03b4eW =\n\n(A14)\n\n\u2212(1 \u2212 e)\n.\nln(10)(1 \u2212 [1 \u2212 e]2 )\n\nThe uncertainty \u01ebQ in Q can be derived from eqs. A1 and A10 assuming uncorrelated errors:\n( q \u01eb2 +\u01eb2\n\u2206s\nW obs\n+ \u01eb2 for HI widths\n(1+z)\nh 2 i \u2206t\n\u01ebQ =\n\u01ebW obs\nW21\nfor ORC widths,\n(1+z) WORC\n\n(A17)\n\n(A18)\n\nwhere \u01ebW obs is the width measurement uncertainty, and the uncertainty on W21 /WORC is assumed to be negligible.\nIn the SFI++, \u01eb\u2206s = 0.25\u2206s , \u01eb\u2206t = 0.25\u2206t , and \u01ebq = 0.15q0 (Giovanelli et al. 1997b).\nThe values of log W and \u01ebW computed here are identical to parameters log(WT F ) and \u01ebw published in tables 2 and 4\nof S07.\nSFI++ Disk Sizes: Isophotal Radii\nAs explained in \u00a72.1.3, we adopt the radius of the disk corresponding to the \u03bcI = 23.5 mag arcsec\u22122 isophote as the\nSFI++ disk size:\n\u0002\n\u0003\u22121\no\nr23.5\n= r23.5 (1 \u2212 e)\u2212\u03b2 + \u2206R\n,\n(A19)\n\nwhere the terms in brackets on the right-hand side correct for internal extinction in the disk following the prescription\nof Giovanelli et al. (1995). In eq. A19, \u2206R is a small perturbative adjustment to account for photometric profile\nvariations in galaxies with a given MI :\n\u0013\n\u0012\nrd\nrd\n\u03b1\u22122\u03b2\n\u2212h\ni ,\n(A20)\n\u2206R = \u2212 ln(10) log(1 \u2212 e)(1 \u2212 e)\nr23.5\nr23.5\n(c.f. eq. 7 of Giovanelli et al. 1995) where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are luminosity-dependent factors shown in their fig. 7. We use the\nbest-fitting linear relations:\n\u03b1 = 0.041 + 1.0MI ,\n(A21)\n\u03b2 = 0.031 + 0.863MI .\n\n(A22)\n\nwith MI from eq. A2. In eq. A20, rd is the measured disk scale-length and hrd /r23.5 i is the average ratio of disk\nscale-lengths to isophotal radii as a function of MI for our sample, given by eq. 1.\n\n\fSFI++ disk galaxy scaling relations\n\n19\n\nThe parameter r23.5 in eqs. A19 and A20 is the measured isophotal radius robs,23.5 corrected for galactic extinction\nAI , a k-correction kI and cosmological surface brightness dimming per unit frequency interval:\nln(10)rd\n[AI \u2212 kI + 2.5 log(1 + z)3 ].\n2.5\nWe use the same values of AI , kI and z as adopted to compute MI (eq. A2).\nExpressing eq. A19 in physical, logarithmic units, we obtain:\n\u0013\n\u0012\ncz\no\n\u2212 log B,\nlog R23.5 = log(r23.5 ) + log\n100h(1 + z)\nr23.5 = robs,23.5 +\n\n(A23)\n\n(A24)\n\nwhere we have adopted the angular size distance and B converts angular size units to radians. We note that the\ncosmological surface brightness dimming term in eq. A23 partly offsets the cosmological stretching implied by the\nangular size distance in eq. A24.\nWe assume that the measurement errors on the individual parameters used to derive log R23.5 are uncorrelated, and\nfollowing Giovanelli et al. (1997b) we neglect the contributions from cz and kI . We note that because the perturbative\ncorrection term \u2206R is small compared to the measurement errors \u01ebr on robs,23.5 for most galaxies in the sample, we\nassume that the uncertainty on this correction simply scales with its amplitude. The measurement errors on log R23.5\nare therefore:\n2 2\n2 2\n2\n2\n\u01eb2\u2206R + \u03b4eR\n\u01ebe ,\n(A25)\n\u01ebrd + \u03b4AR\n\u01eb2A + \u03b4\u03b22 \u01eb2\u03b2 + \u03b4\u2206R\n\u01eb2R \u2261 \u01eb2logR23.5 = \u03b4r2 \u01eb2r + \u03b4rd\nwhere\n\u03b4r =\n\n1\n,\nln(10)r23.5\n\nAI \u2212 kI + 2.5 log(1 + z)3\n,\n2.5r23.5\nrd\n\u03b4AR =\n,\n2.5r23.5\n\u0015\n\u0014\no\nlog(1 \u2212 e)\nr23.5\n,\n\u03b4\u03b2 =\nr23.5 (1 \u2212 e)\u03b2\n\u0012 o \u0013\n1\nr23.5\n\u03b4\u2206R = \u2212\n,\nln(10) r23.5\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03b2\nro\n.\n= \u2212 23.5\nr23.5 ln(10)(1 \u2212 e)1+\u03b2\n\n\u03b4rd =\n\n\u03b4eR\n\n(A26)\n(A27)\n(A28)\n(A29)\n(A30)\n(A31)\n\nFollowing the approach of Giovanelli et al. (1997b), we adopt uncertainties of \u01eb\u03b2 = 0.15\u03b2 and \u01eb\u2206R = 0.15\u2206R.\nIndividual measurement uncertainties \u01ebr on robs,23.5 and \u01ebrd on rd are not available for SFI++ galaxies. We therefore\nadopt appropriate characteristic values \u01ebr = 0.05robs,23.5 and \u01ebrd = 0.15rd (M. P. Haynes, priv. comm.).\nB. MEASUREMENT UNCERTAINTIES IN THE SFI++ SCALING RELATIONS\n\nBelow, we derive relations describing the measurement error contributions \u01ebmes for the scaling relations constructed\nfrom R, L and V (see eq. 5), accounting for correlations between the measurement errors in these quantities. We also\nderive the expected contribution to the intrinsic scatter of each relation from galaxy peculiar velocities.\nThe SFI++ LV Relation\nThe LV relation in the SFI++ is expressed as a linear correlation between L = MI and V = log W (Giovanelli et al.\n1997b, M06, S07):\nMI = aLV + bLV log W ,\n(B1)\nwhere aLV and bLV are the best-fitting zero point and slope. The net contribution of measurement uncertainties to\nthis scatter can be derived from the expressions for MI (eq. A2) and log W (eq. A13):\n2\n\u01eb2e + \u01eb2\u2206LV ,\n\u01eb2LV \u2261 \u01eb2mes = \u01eb2m + \u01eb2A + \u03b4\u03b32 \u01eb2\u03b3 + (bLV \u03b4Q )2 \u01eb2Q + (bLV \u03b4q )2 \u01eb2q + \u03b4eLV\n\n(B2)\n\nwhere \u03b4\u03b3 , \u03b4Q and \u03b4q are given in equations A7, A15 and A16, respectively, and\n\u03b4eLV = \u03b4eM \u2212 bLV \u03b4eW ,\n\n(B3)\n\nwhere \u03b4eM and \u03b4eW are given in eqs. A8 and A17 (see also Giovanelli et al. 1997b, M06). The parameter \u01eb\u2206LV is the\nuncertainty in the morphological type correction \u2206LV computed in eq. 4, which we take as \u01eb\u2206LV = 0.15\u2206LV . We note\nthat given the number of galaxies in the SFI++, the statistical uncertainties on aLV and bLV are small compared to\nparameter measurement uncertainties, and their contribution to the error budget can be neglected.\n\n\f20\n\nSaintonge & Spekkens\n\nIt is clear that since log W is a distance-independent quantity, peculiar velocities Vpec introduce scatter in the LV\nrelation only in MI . Considering the 5th term on the RHS of eq. A2, a peculiar velocity Vpec contributes a scatter\n\u01ebLV,V pec = 5 log(1 + Vpec /cz) ,\n\n(B4)\n\nThe SFI++ RV Relation\nWe express the SFI++ RV relation as a linear relation between R = log R23.5 (eq. A24) and V = log W (eq. A13):\nlog R23.5 = aRV + bRV log W ,\n\n(B5)\n\nwhere aRV and bRV are the best-fitting zero-point and slope. The total measurement error contribution \u01ebRV to the\nscatter in the RV relation is therefore:\n2\n2\n2 2\n2\n\u01eb2e + \u01eb2\u2206RV ,\n\u01eb2\u2206R + (bRV \u03b4Q )2 \u01eb2Q + (bRV \u03b4q )2 \u01eb2q + \u03b4eRV\n\u01ebrd + \u03b4AR\n\u01eb2A + \u03b4\u03b22 \u01eb2\u03b2 + \u03b4\u2206R\n\u01eb2RV \u2261 \u01eb2mes = \u03b4r2 \u01eb2r + \u03b4rd\n\n(B6)\n\nwhere\n\u03b4eRV = \u03b4eR \u2212 bRV \u03b4eW .\n\n(B7)\n\nIn eq. B6, \u03b4r , \u03b4rd , \u03b4AR , \u03b4\u03b2 , \u03b4\u2206R , \u03b4Q and \u03b4q are given by eqs. A26, A27, A28, A29, A30, A15 and A16, respectively.\nIn eq. B7, \u03b4eR and \u03b4eW are given by eqs. A31 and A17. The parameter \u01eb\u2206RV accounts for the uncertainty in the\nmorphological correction of eq. 3, which we take to be \u01eb\u2206RV = 0.15\u2206RV .\nAs in the LV relation, peculiar velocities introduce scatter in the RV relation only along the log R23.5 axis because\nlog W is a distance-independent quantity. The second term on the RHS of eq. A24 shows that the scatter along this\naxis for non-zero Vpec is:\n\u01ebRV,V pec = \u2212 log(1 + Vpec /cz) ,\n(B8)\nThe SFI++ RL relation\nWe express the SFI++ RL relation as a linear relation between R = log R23.5 and L = MI :\nlog R23.5 = aRL + bRL MI .\n\n(B9)\n\nThe total measurement error contribution to the scatter in the RL relation is therefore:\n2 2\n2\n2\n2\n\u01eb2RL \u2261 \u01eb2mes = \u03b4r2 \u01eb2r + \u03b4rd\n\u01ebrd + \u03b4\u03b22 \u01eb2\u03b2 + \u03b4\u2206R\n\u01eb2\u2206R + b2RL \u01eb2m + (bRL \u03b4\u03b3 )2 \u01eb2\u03b3 + \u03b4ARL\n\u01eb2A + \u03b4eRL\n\u01eb2e + \u01eb2\u2206RL ,\n\n(B10)\n\nwhere\n\u03b4ARL = \u03b4AR \u2212 bRL ,\n\n\u03b4eRL = \u03b4eR \u2212 bRL \u03b4eM .\n\n(B11)\n\nIn eq. B10, \u03b4r , \u03b4rd , \u03b4\u03b2 , \u03b4\u2206R and \u03b4\u03b3 are given by eqs. A26, A27, A29, A30 and A7, respectively, while \u03b4eR and \u03b4eM\nin eq. B11 are given by eqs. A31 and A8. The parameter \u01eb\u2206RL accounts for the uncertainty in the morphological\ncorrection of eq. 2, which we adopt as \u01eb\u2206RL = 0.15\u2206RL .\nUnlike the RV and LV relations, peculiar velocities introduce scatter in both variables of the RL relation, since\nlog R23.5 and MI depend on distance. Eqs. B8 and B4 show that a positive peculiar velocity Vpec simultaneously\nscatters points towards fainter L and smaller R. The amplitude of the scatter is:\nq\n\u221a\n(B12)\n\u01ebRL,V pec = [5 log(1 + Vpec /cz)]2 + [log(1 + Vpec /cz)]2 = 26 log(1 + Vpec /cz) .\nThis scatter vector has a constant slope in the L\u2013R plane:\nSRL,V pec =\n\n\u2212 log(1 + Vpec /cz)\n= \u22120.2 ,\n5 log(1 + Vpec /cz)\n\n(B13)\n\nthis value is similar to the best-fitting slope \u03b2 = \u22120.16 of the measured RL relations (Table 1). Peculiar velocities\ntherefore scatter points almost exactly along the RL relation, and do not contribute significantly to the intrinsic scatter\nin the relation.\n\n\f"}
