By tuning the strength of the\nlaser field, the effective interactions between atoms can\nbe tuned to become stronger than their kinetic energy.\nFor Bose systems, such a competition between kinetic t\nand interaction energy U drives a quantum phase transition4,5 from a kinetic energy dominated superfluid (SF)\nphase to an interaction dominated Mott insulating (MI)\nphase. The Bose Hubbard model (BHM) captures the\nessential physics of this problem4 , provided the interactions between the bosons are smaller than interband energies and the problem can be treated in the single band\napproximation. While the BHM was proposed much before optical lattice experiments became available, a direct\nexperimental realization was missing. In condensed matter systems, Josephson junction arrays6, 4 He in vycor\nand aerogels7, vortices in superconductors8 and quantum magnets9 can be modeled by the BHM, but the actual systems have additional complications of disorder\nor longer range interactions which make the comparisons\nbetween theory and experiment difficult.\nOne of the main advantages of the cold atom systems\nis that they are clean and much more tunable: the density of bosons, their effective interaction, the tunneling\namplitude between the wells, the number of lattice sites,\nthe shape of the trapping potential and aspect ratios can\nall be varied rather easily, making it possible to study\nthe effects of inhomogeneity and dimensionality. In addition, it is possible to add random potentials to study\nthe effects of disorder. This sets the optical lattice systems apart as a useful testing ground for theoretical ideas\nin the area of strongly interacting bosons and fermions.\nThis model has also provided tremendous impetus for the\ndevelopment of new measurement techniques to address\n\nquestions about the nature of the excitations especially\nnear the transition 10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18 . The recent experiments on the dynamics19,20 have given a window into\nthe different time scales operating within the different\nphases and around the quantum phase transitions.\nThe paper is organised as follows: In Sect. II, we\npresent the Bose-Hubbard model and state our main results. In Sect. III, we discuss the nature of the spectral function calculated within the RPA formalism as\nit evolves from the SF to the MI phase by decreasing\nt/U . The sound velocity in the SF phase and its comparison with Bogoliubov theory is contained in Sect. IV.\nThe momentum distribution and the spatial correlations\nare calculated in Sect. V. The RPA formalism is generalized to a spatially inhomogeneous trapping potential\nin Sect. VI. We conclude in Sect. VII with some remarks about the comparison between RPA and mean\nfield theory. There are three appendices that give the\ndetails of the calculations of the Green function within\nRPA (App. A), the Bogoliubov calculation for the BoseHubbard model (App. B), and the momentum distribution function within RPA in the Mott regime (App. C).\nII.\n\nMODEL AND MAIN RESULTS\n\nThe Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian is defined as\n\nH =\u2212\n\n\u0011 U X\nX\nt X\u0010 \u2020\nni ,\nni (ni \u22121)\u2212\u03bc\nai aj + ai a\u2020j +\n2z\n2 i\ni\nhiji\n\n(1)\nwhere ai and a\u2020i are bosonic annihilation and creation\noperators respectively and ni = a\u2020i ai is the density operator. The parameter U describes the on-site repulsive\ninteraction between bosons, t is the tunneling parameter\nbetween nearest neighbors as indicated by the symbol\n\n\f2\nhiji, \u03bc is the chemical potential that fixes the number of\nparticles and z = 2D is the coordination number in D\ndimensions. This Hamiltonian shows a quantum phase\ntransition (QPT) from the SF to the MI phase as a function of t/U . The theoretical approaches used to investigate this Hamiltonian include mean field theory21 , perturbation theory22 , variational methods23 and quantum\nMonte Carlo simulations 24,25 .\nIn this paper, we use a Green's function formalism to\ninvestigate the excitations and correlations in the BHM.\nWe start from the mean-field (MF) ground state which is\nessentially a product of single site states and go beyond\nit by including inter-well coupling within a random phase\napproximation (RPA) 26,27 .\nOur main results are as follows:\n(1) In the weakly interacting SF (t/U \u2248 100) the gapless phonons of the SF, or the Goldstone modes arising\ndue to the broken gauge symmetry, exhaust the sum rule\non the total spectral weight, as expected. For t/U \u2248 10\nthere are already small deviations from Bogoliubov theory and new gapped modes appear in the SF phase.\nThese gapped modes pick up strength as t/U \u2248 1. The\nsum rule is now satisfied only upon including both phonon\nand gapped modes.\n(2) At the transition, we observe the progression of one\nof the phonon modes in the SF into a gapped mode in\nthe MI (the one which is gapless at the QPT). The second gapped mode in the MI instead arises from one of\nthe gapped modes in the SF. Such gapped modes in the\nSF have been reported previously using several theoretical methods 14,15,16,17 . We argue that these additional\ngapped modes are a distinctive signature of a strongly\ncorrelated SF in proximity to a MI in an optical lattice.\nThey indicate the redistribution of spectral weight from\nthe coherent phonon modes into incoherent excitations,\nand are a precursor of the MI beyond the QPT.\n(3) We calculate the sound velocity in the\u221aRPA formalism and show that it agrees with c = 1/ \u03bam\u2217 calculated independently from the mean-field effective mass\nand compressibility. In a wide range of parameters, except very close to the SF-MI phase transition, the above\nsound velocity compares well with the predictions of Bogoliubov theory.\n(4) We exploit a special feature of superfluids that allows us to extract the condensate fraction n0 from the\nstrength of the phonon modes in the spectral function.\n(5) We calculate the spatial correlations in the case\nwhere an inhomogeneous confining potential is superimposed on the optical lattice. The response to a perturbation is strongly influenced by the presence of alternating\nshells of Mott insulator and superfluid regions.\n\nIII. FORMALISM: RPA APPROXIMATION,\nSPECTRAL FUNCTION, AND EXCITATIONS\n\nWe start with the mean-field approximation in real\nspace21 obtained by giving the annihilation and creation\n\noperators an expectation value defined by hai = ha\u2020 i = \u03c6.\nThe order parameter \u03c6 identifies the nature of the system: it is non-zero in the SF phase and vanishes in the\ninsulating phase. Substituting a = \u03c6 + \u00e3, a\u2020 = \u03c6 + \u00e3\u2020 ,\nin Eq. (1), where \u00e3 and \u00e3\u2020 are the fluctuations of the\nBose field around the mean field value, the Hamiltonian\nH can be rewritten as a sum of on-site Hamiltonians\n\nHiMF =\n\nU\nni (ni \u2212 1) \u2212 \u03bcni \u2212 t\u03c6(a\u2020i + ai ) + t\u03c62 ,\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhich include the tunneling at the mean field level\nthrough the order parameter \u03c6. In the MF approximation, we neglect\nthe non-local\ninter-well hopping term\n\u0011\nP \u0010 \u2020\n\u2020\n\u2212(t/2z) hiji \u00e3i \u00e3j + \u00e3i \u00e3j , which we will later treat in\nRPA.\nThe HiMF can be diagonalized numerically, leading to\na set of on-site eigenstates such that Hi |i\u03b1i = \u01eb\u03b1 |i\u03b1i.\nIn the Mott limit the eigenstates |i\u03b1i are number states,\nwhile in the SF regime they are coherent superpositions\nof several number states, allowing the order parameter\nto be different from zero. The MF ground state solution\nis given by the product state |\u03a6i = \u03a0i |i, 0i, equivalent to\nthe one obtained in the Gutzwiller Ansatz, where |i, 0i is\nthe ground state of HiMF .\n\n1\n\u03bc/U\n\nn=1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\nt/U\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Mean field phase diagram in the \u03bc/U\nvs. t/U plane. The blue line shows the Mott insulating lobe\nat density n = 1. On this diagram, we indicate two points\nwhere the QPT happens, that we are going to discuss in this\npaper: a generic one at \u03bc/U = 0.5\u221aand t/U \u2248 0.167 (black)\nand the tip of the lobe at \u03bc/U = 2 \u2212 1 and t/U \u2248 0.1716\n(red) where the QPT takes place at constant density.\n\nWithin the mean field approximation, the state of the\nsystem is described by a product state over the different wells, neglecting all inter-well correlations. However,\neven in the MI, correlations between neighboring wells do\nnot vanish; in fact they get large as t/U is increased from\nthe Mott side, ultimately diverging at the transition. Experimental evidence of these correlations is found in the\ninterference picture of an atomic cloud released from a 3D\noptical lattice, the visibility of which does not suddenly\n\n\f3\nvanish at the phase transition28,29,30,31,32 . These important features are captured by the RPA performed on the\nnon-local tunneling terms of the BHM. At the end of this\npaper, we discuss the limitations of the RPA method and\nhow it compares with the mean-field approximation.\nTo go beyond the mean-field approximation, we treat\nthe inter-well hopping term within RPA, as described\nin App. A26,27 . This method allows us to compute\nthe Green's function G(q, \u03c9) = hha\u2020q ; aq ii\u03c9 , defined\nin Eqs. (A4,A6), and from that, the spectral function\nA(q, \u03c9) = \u2212(1/\u03c0)ImG(q, \u03c9).\nDue to the commutation relations of the bosonic destruction and creation operators, the spectral function\nalways satisfies the sum rule\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nA(q, \u03c9)d\u03c9 = 1.\n\n(3)\n\nFrom the spectral function, one can extract the excitation\nspectrum, the strength of the excitation modes, and the\nrelated density of states\n\nDOS(\u03c9) =\n\nZ\n\nA(q, \u03c9)dq.\n\n(4)\n\nMoreover, the spectral function is an essential ingredient\nto compute the momentum distribution\n\nn(q) =\n\nha\u2020q aq i\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nA(q, \u03c9)d\u03c9\n\n(5)\n\nand the single particle density matrix given by the\nFourier transform of the momentum distribution in real\nspace\n\u03c1(r, r\u2032 ) = ha\u2020r ar\u2032 i =\n\n1 X iq*(r\u2212r\u2032 )\ne\nn(q),\nN q\n\n(6)\n\nwhere N indicates the number of lattice wells . The long\ndistance behavior of \u03c1(r, r\u2032 ) as a function of the relative\ndistance approaches the condensate density n0 which is\nnon zero in a SF and vanishes in the MI. In the following\nwe will calculate and discuss all these quantities.\nA fundamental implication of broken symmetry for\nbosonic systems is that the Goldstone modes are directly\nreflected in the single particle spectrum. In other words,\nphonons which are related to modes of density-density\nfluctuations (or two-particle Green function) also show\nup as the poles in the single particle Green function33 .\nWe study the behavior of the poles of the Green's function, their strength, momentum and frequency dependence, to extract information about the excitations of\nthe system. In the two extreme limits of deep MI and\nweakly interacting (Bogoliubov) SF, the Green's function\ncan be calculated analytically and from it, the excitations\nfrequencies and the momentum distribution n(q).\n\nA.\n\nDeep Mott regime\n\nIn the deep Mott regime (zero tunneling), for U (n \u2212\n1) < \u03bc < U n, one finds\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\nn+1\nn\nGMI (q, \u03c9) =\n\u2212\n2\u03c0 \u03c9 \u2212 (U n \u2212 \u03bc) \u03c9 \u2212 (U (n \u2212 1) \u2212 \u03bc)\n(7)\n\u001a\nUn \u2212 \u03bc > 0\n(8)\n\u03c9MI (q) =\nU (n \u2212 1) \u2212 \u03bc < 0\nnMI (q) = n, \u2200 q,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere n is the atomic occupation at each lattice site. The\nspectral function consists of two \u03b4-functions, one at positive energy U n \u2212 \u03bc (relative to the chemical potential)\nrequired to add a particle and one at negative energy\nU (n \u2212 1) \u2212 \u03bc, required to remove a particle or add a\nhole to the MI, as seen in Eq. (8). The spectral function\nA(q, \u03c9) obtained using expression (7) trivially satisfies\nthe sum rule in Eq. (3). The momentum distribution, as\ndefined in Eqs. (5,9), is completely flat, corresponding to\nvanishing site-to-site correlations, and normalized to the\ntotal number of atoms in the lattice (n times the number\nof sites). Correspondingly, the single particle density matrix (6), given by the Fourier transform of the momentum\ndistribution, shows strictly on-site correlations.\n\nB.\n\nWeakly interacting regime\n\nIn the weakly interacting SF regime34 , we have\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n|uq |2\n|v\u2212q |2\nGBG (q, \u03c9) =\n,\n\u2212\n2\u03c0 \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9q\n\u03c9 + \u03c9\u2212q\n\u03c9BG (q) = \u00b1\u03c9\u00b1q ,\n2\n\nnBG (q) = n0 \u03b4q,0 + |v\u2212q | ,\n\n(10)\n(11)\n(12)\n\nwhere uq and vq are the Bogoliubov amplitudes, \u03c9q is\nthe Bogoliubov frequency at momentum q (see App. B\nfor details), and n0 the condensate density. In the\nweakly interacting SF regime, the sum rule in Eq. (3)\nis constrained by the Bogoliubov normalization condition |uq |2 \u2212 |v\u2212q |2 = 1. The excitation energies are given\nby symmetric poles at positive and negative frequencies\ncorresponding to the energies of the Bogoliubov spectrum, highlighting in particular phononic excitations at\nlow momentum.\nThe momentum distribution, given by integrating the\nspectral function over negative energies, has a singular\ncontribution from the condensate at zero momentum.\nThe integral over all momenta different from zero gives\nthe number of non condensed atoms, contributing the depletion from the condensate. In the regime where Bogoliubov theory is valid, the depletion is negligible compared\nto the atoms in the condensate.\n\n\f4\n\nThe RPA formalism allows us to calculate the spectral function with special emphasis on the strong correlation region near the QPT. In the deep SF, we find\nphonon collective modes reflected in the single particle\nspectrum. As t/U is decreased, the spectral weight is\nredistributed over a multi-mode structure composed by\ncoherent phonon excitations and gapped single-particle\nexcitations. When entering the MI phase at the QPT,\nthe spectral weight reorganises and is shared by only two\ngapped modes, describing single particle excitations, one\nat positive and one at negative energy. In the following,\nwe will deiscuss this behaviour more in detail.\n\n\u2192 q/\u03c0 \u2192\n\nProgression from SF to MI\n\n1\n\n(a)\nt/U=10\n\n0.5\n0\n\u22125\n\n\u2192 q/\u03c0 \u2192\n\nC.\n\n1\n\n0\n\u03c9/t\n(b)\n\nt/U=1\n\n0.5\n0\n\n\u2192 q/\u03c0 \u2192\n\n\u22125\n1\n\n0\n\u03c9/t\n\n5\n\n(c)\nt/U=0.25\n\n0.5\n0\n\u22125\n\n\u2192 q/\u03c0 \u2192\n\nWe use the position of the poles of the Green's function\nto determine the following results about the excitations\nof the system in the different regimes:\n(i) For a large number of particles per site (\u2248 100)\nand weak interactions (t/U \u2248 100), we exactly recover\nthe Bogoliubov results. We point out that being able to\ndescribe the weakly interacting regime starting from the\nBHM is not a trivial result, because of the large number\nof basis states required (almost 150 states per site).\n(ii) By increasing the interactions and decreasing the\nnumber of particles per site, we observe small deviations\nbetween the spectrum obtained by RPA and the Bogoliubov theory: additional modes appear at higher frequencies, as shown in Fig. 2(a) for t/U = 10, in contrast\nwith Bogoliubov theory which predicts a single excitation\nmode. While there are also differences in the dispersion\nof the sound modes at large momenta, we find in general\nthat the Bogoliubov prediction turns out to be quite accurate in describing the low-q part of the spectrum and\nthe sound velocity, even in the case of strong interactions\n(see Sect. IV).\n(iii) As t/U becomes of order unity and the effect of\nstrong correlations grows, additional gapped modes in\nthe SF phase are clearly visible and grow in strength as\nseen in Fig. 2(b). The phonon modes are not sufficient\nto exhaust the sum rule in Eq. (3). In a strongly interacting SF (e.g for t/U < 0.25, as shown in Fig. 2(c)),\nmany modes (in the cases we have considered, up to four\nat positive and four at negative energy) have to be included in order to exhaust the sum rule in Eq. (3). In\nthe particular case of \u03bc/U = 0.5 and t/U = 0.25, the full\ndispersion of the modes is shown in Fig. 3(b).\n(iv) In the MI , only two excitation modes exist, as\nshown in Figs. 2(d) and 3(a). The mode at positive and\nthe one at negative energy correspond respectively to the\nenergy needed to create a particle or a hole in the system. For any given t/U , the difference of the excitation\nenergies at q = 0 exactly coincides to the width of the\nmean-field Mott lobe at the same t/U .\n\n5\n\n1\n\n0\n\u03c9/t\n\n5\n\n(d)\nt/U=0.16\n\n0.5\n0\n\u22125\n\n0\n\u03c9/t\n\n5\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Spectral function A(q, \u03c9) as a function\nof \u03c9 for various q.

We are therefore confident that we have\nidentified all the excitations which contribute in a nonnegligible way to the spectrum.\n\nIn Figs. 4,5, we plot the position of the resonances and\ntheir strengths for a fixed value of q = \u03c0/50, varying\nthe parameter t/U across the phase transition for fixed\nchemical potential. As explained above, the many-mode\nspectrum in the SF phase evolves into the two-mode excitation spectrum in the MI.\nThe transition from the MI to the SF phase occurs\nwhen one of the two Mott branches becomes gapless (see\nFig. 4(a)). This is the particle (hole) gapped mode in\nthe MI depending on whether the chemical potential \u03bc is\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Energy (a) and strength (b) of the\nmodes at low q = \u03c0/50 as a function of t/U for \u03bc/U = 0.5.\nNotice the presence of both phonons and gapped modes in the\nstrongly interacting SF and their evolution into two gapped\nmodes into the MI. One of the gapped modes in the MI evolves\nfrom the phonon mode in the SF and the other one from a\ngapped mode in the SF. The thin vertical line at t/U \u2248 0.167\nindicates the QPT.\n\nabove (below) the tip of the lobe. This Mott branch\nevolves into the phononic mode at positive (negative)\nenergy, while the other phononic mode arises at zero\nstrength without having a precursor in the Mott phase.\nThe second Mott branch evolves into a gapped superfluid\nmode, and symmetrical in energy a second superfluid\ngapped mode arises with zero strength without having\na precursor in the Mott phase (see Fig. 4(b)).\nThe behavior at the tip of the lobe is quite interesting.\nIn that case both Mott gapped modes become simultaneously gapless at the QPT (see Fig. 5(a)). From them the\nlowest four modes in the SF arise, two of them becoming phononic modes and two of them becoming gapped\nmodes when moving away from the transition. However,\nwithin our approach, we find a similar behavior to the\none described above, namely that one of the Mott modes\nevolves into a SF phononic mode, while the second one\nevolves into a SF gapped mode (see Figs. 5(b)).\nA similar result was found by Huber and collaborators 17 using an effective 3-state approximation and mapping onto a spin-1 Hamiltonian. They further suggested\nthat measurements of the dynamical structure factor using Bragg spectroscopy and lattice modulations could be\nan effective way to investigate the different modes.\nThe problem was also investigated by Sengupta and\nDupuis 14 in the strong coupling regime by deriving an\n\n\f6\n1\n\nDOS(\u03c9)\n\n(a)\n\n0.5\n\u03c9 /U\ni\n\n0\n\n(a)\n\n20\n\nt/U=0.25\n\n0\n\u221220\n\n\u22120.5\n\n\u221210\n\n\u22121\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0\n\u03c9/t\n\nDOS(\u03c9)\n\nt/U\n(b)\n\n20\n\n20 \u2212200\nSi\n\n(b)\n\n20\n\nt/U=0.17\n\n0\n\u221220\n\n0.17 0.171 0.172 0.173\n\n0\n\n\u22125\n\n0\n\u03c9/t\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\nt/U\nFIG. 5: (Color online) Energy (a) and strength (b) \u221a\nof the\nmodes at low q = \u03c0/50 as a function of t/U at \u03bc/U = 2 \u2212 1\ncorresponding to the tip of the lobe.

In Fig. 6(a) one can\nrecognize the multi-mode structure of a strongly correlated SF through a clearly enhanced DOS in the energy\nrange of the corresponding excitation branch. In particular, we can see here two phononic branches and two\ngapped ones. When approaching the QPT (t/U = 0.17\nand Fig. 6(b)), we encounter a similar structure, where\nthe width of the gapped branch at negative energy is\nincreased, while the gapped branch at positive energy is\nnot visible on the scale of this picture (although existing),\nsince its strength goes to zero at the QPT. As expected,\nin the Mott regime, the DOS is different from zero only in\nthe energy range of the two gapped excitation branches,\none at negative and one at positive energy (Figs. 6(c,d)).\n\n5\n(c)\n\n20\n\nt/U=0.16\n\n0\n\u221220\n\u22125\n\nDOS(\u03c9)\n\n0.1\n\nDOS(\u03c9)\n\n\u221220\n0\n\n10\n\n0\n\u03c9/t\n\n5\n(d)\n\n20\n\nt/U=0.10\n\n0\n\u221220\n\u22125\n\n0\n\u03c9/t\n\n5\n\nFIG. 6: Density of states for several values of t/U .

We have considered a\ntwo-dimensional system, which allows for the existence\nof Bose-Einstein condensation with long range order in\nthe SF regime.\n\n(16)\n\nas explained in detail in App. B. The Bogoliubov predictions are remarkably good in a wide range of parameters\nand fail only in the close proximity of the phase transition (see thin lines in Fig. 7), since Bogoliubov theory\ndoes not account correctly for the vanishing of the order\nparameter at that point.\n\nV.\n\n1\nt/U\n\nd\u03c1/ d\u03bc\n\nand compare it with the one obtained with the compressibility relation in Eq.

(14)\nonly requires the knowledge of the mean-field solution,\nwhich provides the equation of state \u03bc(\u03c1) and the SF\ndensity \u03c1s = |\u03c6|2 .\nWe find that when the SF-MI transition, tuned by t/U\nand \u03bc/U , is approached at a generic point away from the\ntip of the lobe, the sound velocity vanishes, as shown\nin Fig. 7(a). This is due to the fact that at the transition the compressibility remains finite, but the SF density vanishes. Instead, the tip of the lobe where the phase\ntransition happens at constant density and \u2202\u03c1/\u2202\u03bc = 0 is\na special point: there, a perfect compensation between\nthe divergent inverse compressibility and the vanishing\nSF density takes place, which results in a finite sound\nvelocity as seen in Fig. 7(b).\nWe complete our analysis by comparing the sound velocity calculated above with the results of Bogoliubov\ntheory, which for a tunneling parameter t, on-site interaction U and coordination number z, predicts the value\n\n0.5\n\n5\n\n(15)\nc (blue), \u03c6 (red)\n\nlim \u03c9(q) = c|q|,\n\n|q| \u21920\n\n0\n0\n\nMOMENTUM DISTRIBUTION AND\nSPATIAL CORRELATIONS\n\nFrom Eq.

We have checked\nthat we can reproduce the momentum distribution in the\ntwo extreme cases of deep MI (see Eq. (9)) and weakly\ninteracting SF (see Eq. (12)).\nIn the Mott phase with non vanishing tunneling, we\nfind that the momentum distribution presents a modulation showing up as interference peaks in the expansion\npictures29,31 . When the QPT is reached, a strong peak\ndevelops at q = 0 corresponding to the condensate. However, in a SF close to the phase transition the background\nmomentum distribution (at q 6= 0) is large indicating a\nstrong depletion from the condensate due to interactions.\nThe momentum distribution obtained with the RPA\nmethod happens to be not correctly normalized to the\ntotal number of atoms.

In the MI, the\nsingle particle density matrix shows that the correlations\ndecay over a finite length scale, which decreases by decreasing the tunneling and moving deeper into the Mott\nlobe. From those results, we have direct access to the\nlength scale of the correlations in the insulating regime.\nThe condensate fraction can be in principle extracted\nfrom theP\nmomentum distribution, by subtracting the depletion\nq6=0 n(q) from the total density n, or equivalently by looking at the asymptotic value at large distances of the single-particle density matrix \u03c1(r, r\u2032 ).

INHOMOGENEOUS SYSTEM: OPTICAL\nLATTICES IN AN EXTERNAL TRAPPING\nPOTENTIAL\n\nWe extend the RPA formalism to real space and include a spatially inhomogeneous potential, which is taken\ninto account in the BHM through a site-dependent chemical potential. The self consistent MF solution produces\nalternating shells of insulating and superfluid phases\nmoving out from the center to the edge of the trap2,40,41 .\nIn the inhomogeneous system, the derivation of the\nequation for the Green's function is the same outlined\nin App. A, with the essential caution that the on-site\nenergies \u01ebi\u03b1 and the tunneling coefficients T\u0303\u03b1ik\u2032 \u03b1\u03b3\u03b3 \u2032 depends\non position and must be calculated respectively for each\nsite and for each pair of neighboring sites.\nIn the presence of an external trapping potential, the\ndensity and order parameter become non-uniform as\nshown in Fig. 11(a). With our specific choice of parameters, one finds a central Mott core at density n = 1,\nsurrounded by a ring of superfluid. The sequence of panels (b) to (d) shows G(r, r\u2032 , \u03c9) as a function of r\u2032 for fixed\nr and \u03c9, which roughly speaking represent the effect of\nperturbing the system at different points: perturbations\nin the SF regions produce a large effect all along the SF\nring. As the perturbation moves to regions with lower order parameter near the SF-Mott interface its effect gets\nreduced and finally perturbations in Mott-like regions decrease exponentially and produce negligible effects.\n\n\u221210\n\u221210\n\n\u22120.3\n\n0.01\n\n10\n5\n\n0\n\n1\n\n10\n\n(d)\n0.01\n\n10\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n\u22125\n\n3\nn\n\n0.3\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u22125\n\n0\n\n10\n\n\u22120.01\n\n\u221210\n\u221210\n\n0\n\n10\n\n\u22120.01\n\nFIG. 11: (Color online) Inhomogeneous system: (a) order\nparameter in the trap: It is zero in the central MI core and\nfinite and large in the surrounding SF ring. The other panels\nshow G(r, r\u2032 ) for a given value of the energy as a function of\nr\u2032 for a fixed r (black dot): (b) r = (\u22126, 0) in the SF ring; (c)\nr = (\u22123, 0) at the interface between the MI core and the SF\nring; (d) r = (0, 0) in the center of the MI core.\n\nThe results shown in Fig. 11 are obtained for a given\nvalue of the energy \u03c9. At different energies the structure\nremains the same, but the period of the oscillations along\nthe ring changes. By integrating G(r, r\u2032 , \u03c9) over \u03c9, one\ngets the equal-time correlation function G(r, r\u2032 ). This\nquantity would maintain the ring-like behavior shown\nFig. 11 and hence be qualitatively similar to the one calculated by Wessel and collaborators42.\nBefore searching for quantitative results in the non uniform system, one should ponder on the consequences of\nthe problem in the normalization of the momentum distribution discussed in Sect. V, which might affect the\nextension of the RPA method to trapped systems. While\nthis extension is technically simple, although it might become computationally quite expensive, its validity is to\nbe questioned due to the co-existence in the same system of different phases (MI and SF), where, as we have\nexplained above, RPA introduces different normalization\nfactors. For this reason, while we believe one can get\nsome insights on the correlations in the system, those\npieces of information can be trusted only at the qualitative level.\n\nVII.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS: RPA VS\nMEAN-FIELD\n\nIn this work, we have studied the excitations and the\nspatial correlations of the BHM in the RPA approximation. It is interesting to compare the information that is\nobtained between the mean field approximation and the\nRPA which includes a certain class of fluctuations:\n(1) The prediction of the SF to MI transition in the\n\n\f10\n[\u03bc/U, t/U ] plane calculated from the vanishing of the order parameter \u03c6 at the mean-field level and by the disappearance of the gapless excitation mode within RPA\nlead to exactly the same result for the boundaries of the\ninsulating lobes.\n(2) At the mean field level, one can extract information about the sound velocity using the compressibilityeffective mass relation, while at the RPA level the sound\nvelocity is given by the slope of the phonon mode. The\ntwo methods again lead to exactly the same result.\n(3) The condensate fraction is n0 = |\u03c6|2 at the meanfield level, whereas in the RPA treatment, it is extracted\nfrom the small q behavior of the spectral function and using the mean-field compressibility. Again the two methods lead to exactly the same result.\nIf the fluctuations around the mean field state were included self-consistently, they would renormalize the energy and order parameter. We then expect the SF state\nto be susceptible to fluctuations and the critical t/U to\nbe shifted to a higher value than the one obtained by the\nMF theory.\nThe RPA method further gives information which is\nnot included in the mean-field treatment. These include\n(i) the excitation spectra; (ii) their strengths; (iii) the\nexistence of new gapped modes in the strongly interacting\nSF phase; (iv) the momentum distribution and spatial\ncorrelations in the system.\nAs an open question, we are left with the role of quantum fluctuations in the vicinity of the QPT, which as we\ndiscussed may have additional effects on physical quantities like the e.g. momentum distribution or the condensate fraction. As explained in App. C, it is to be\nexpected that in our approach the momentum distribution is not normalized. In the Mott limit, a clear deviation from the normalization to the total number of atoms\ncan be calculated analytically. Analogously, in the Bogoliubov regime, exactly recovered in RPA in the dilute\nlimit, where one assumes n = |\u03c6|2 , the normalization is\nlarger that the total number of atoms once the depletion\n(given by the integral over all momenta different from\nzero of |vq |2 ) is added. However, while in the deep MI\nand SF regimes, the change in the normalization is just\na small perturbation, close to the phase transition it is\na striking effect. We attribute this to the fact that we\nperform RPA on the mean-field ground state, without\ntaking the effect of RPA self-consistently into account.\nTo this same reason, we attribute the existence of predictions (1) to (3) which are equal in the mean-field and\nRPA treatments.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nC.M. acknowledges financial support by the EU\nthrough an EIF Marie-Curie Action.

However, as explained in Sect. VII, these\nfluctuations are not included self consistently, allowing\nfeedback into the mean field ground state. Also ignored\nare quantum fluctuations of the order parameter which\nare especially important close to the QPT (see also discussion in App. C).\nMean-field decoupling:\nSubstituting a = \u03c6 + \u00e3, a\u2020 = \u03c6 + \u00e3\u2020 , in Eq.

Then, we\napply the Bogoliubov transformation which diagonalizes\nH2\n\nAPPENDIX C: ANALYTIC CALCULATION OF\nTHE MOMENTUM DISTRIBUTION IN THE\nMOTT REGIME IN THE RPA APPROXIMATION\n\nIn the RPA approximation, the momentum distribution in the MI regime can be calculated analytically. In\nthis appendix, we will present the results for 1, 2, and 3D\nsystems, with the aim of pointing out that close to the\nphase transition quantum fluctuation play a major role\nand are not correctly taken into account by RPA.\nIn the MI regime, the RPA Green's function in\nEq. (A10) can be written as\n\n\f13\n\nGMI (q, \u03c9) =\n\nA11 (\u03c9)\n1\n,\n2\u03c0 1 \u2212 \u01eb(q)A11 (\u03c9)\n\n(C1)\n\nwhere A11 has been defined in Eq.\nP (A12), A12 = A21 = 0\nin the MI, and \u01eb(q) = \u2212(2t/z) i cos(qi ) as before.\nIn particular for the MI at density n (i.e. where the\non-site ground state is |0i = n), we get\nA11 (\u03c9) =\n\nn+1\nn\n\u2212\n, (C2)\n\u03c9 \u2212 (En+1 \u2212 En ) \u03c9 + (En\u22121 \u2212 En )\n\nnumber of wells) gives the total number of atoms. At finite tunneling, the kinetic energy \u01eb(q) gives a modulation\nto the momentum distribution.\nTo find the normalization of n(q), we integrate numerically the analytic expression in Eq. (C5) for different dimensions. The result is shown in Fig. 12 for the MI with\nn = 1, and clearly shows an increase of the normalization toward the phase transition. We attribute this effect\nto the fact that quantum fluctuations are not completely\ntaken into account in this approach. This interpretation\nis confirmed by the fact that this effect diminishes by\nincreasing the dimensionality of the system.\n\n(with En = \u2212n\u03bc + (U/2)n(n \u2212 1)) which obviously coincides a part from a factor 1/2\u03c0 with the Green's function for the MI at zero tunneling previously introduced\nin Eq. (A7).\nBy using definitions in Eqs. (C1,C2) above and defining\n\u2206\u00b1 = En\u00b11 \u2212 En , it is straightforward to see that the\nGreen's function takes the form\n\n1.8\n\nnormalisation\n\n1.6\n\nGMI =\n(C3)\n1\n(n + 1)(\u03c9 + \u2206\u2212 ) \u2212 n(\u03c9 \u2212 \u2206+ )\n=\n,\n2\u03c0 (\u03c9 \u2212 \u2206+ )(\u03c9 + \u2206\u2212 ) \u2212 \u01eb(q)[n\u03c9 + (n + 2)\u2206\u2212 ]\nwhose poles \u03c9\u00b1 can be calculated analytically and have a\nmomentum dependence due to the kinetic energy \u01eb(q) in\nEq. (C1). Hence, the Green's function close to the poles\n(\u03c9 \u2248 \u03c9\u00b1 ), is approximately\nGMI \u2248\n\n1 (n + 1)(\u03c9\u00b1 + \u2206\u2212 ) \u2212 n(\u03c9\u00b1 \u2212 \u2206+ )\n.
