If the initial atoms are Bose\ncondensed [2], the so-formed molecules will also comprise a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)\n[3]. Since the Feshbach resonance is mathematically identical to photoassociation [4, 5, 6],\nthe process that occurs when two ultracold atoms form a molecule by absorbing a photon,\ninsight gathered in either case is applicable to the other. In particular, the most recent results\nfrom photoassociation predict that rogue dissociation, molecular dissociation to noncondensate atom pairs, imposes a maximum achievable rate on atom-molecule conversion, as well as\nthe possibility of coherent Rabi oscillations between the BEC and dissociated atom pairs [7].\nInitial Feshbach resonance experiments in 85 Rb [8] were motivated by the possibility [9] of\nenabling Bose condensation by tuning the natively negative atom-atom scattering length into\nthe positive regime. As part of the experiment that achieved condensation [10], the magnetic\nfield was swept across the Feshbach resonance, resulting in heavy condensate losses (\u223c 80%\n\n\f2\n\n1 Role of Molecular Dissociation in Feshbach-Interacting 85 Rb Condensates\n\nfor the slowest sweep rates). Additional experiments led to the observation of collapsing\ncondensates, an event characterized by bursts of atoms emanating from a remnant BEC, and\ncoined \"bosenova\" for the analogy with a supernova explosion [11]. More recently, experiments with pulsed magnetic fields that come close to, but do not cross, the Feshbach-resonance\nhave revealed a striking increase in condensate loss for a decrease in the interaction time\u2013 until\nreaching very short times [12]. Finally, double-pulse results indicate large amplitude (\u223c 25%)\nremnant-burst oscillations, with the missing atoms (\u223c 10%) prompting speculation on the\nformation of a molecular condensate [13].\nIn the mean time, work on Feshbach-stimulated photoproduction of stable molecular condensates indicates that rogue dissociation dominates atom-molecule conversion for the above\n85\nRb Feshbach resonance, meaning that the production of a significant fraction of molecular\nBEC is not to be expected [14]. Additionally, we find intriguing the assertions of a breakdown of mean-field theory in the face of large resonance-induced scattering lengths [10, 12],\nespecially given that theory actually faults the effective all-atom description [15]. We have\ntherefore tested a mean-field model of coherent atom-molecule conversion against the salient\nfeatures of the JILA experiments [16], and the subsequent understanding is presented in this\nContribution (for related work, see Refs. [17, 18]).\n\nMean-field theory and its validity\nThe mathematical equivalence of the Feshbach-resonance [3] and photoassociation [4, 5] lies\nin both processes being described, in terms of second quantization, as destroying two atoms\nand creating a molecule. We therefore model a quantum degenerate gas of atoms coupled via\na Feshbach resonance to a condensate of quasibound molecules based on Refs. [5, 6, 7]. The\ninitial atoms are denoted by the boson field \u03c6(r, t), and the quasibound molecules by the field\n\u03c8(r, t). The Hamiltonian density for this system is\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0015\n\u0014\n~\u22072\n~\u22072\nH\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u03c6+\u03c8 \u2212\n= \u03c6 \u2212\n+ \u03b40 \u03c8\n~\n2m\n4m\n\u03a9\n2\u03c0~a \u2020 \u2020\n\u2212 \u221a [\u03c8 \u2020 \u03c6\u03c6 + \u03c6\u2020 \u03c6\u2020 \u03c8] +\n\u03c6 \u03c6 \u03c6\u03c6 ,\n(1.1)\n2 \u03c1\nm\ns\u221a\n2\u03c0~3/2 \u03c1 \u0393(\u01eb)\n\u221a ,\n\u03a9 = lim\n\u01eb\u21920\n\u01eb\n\u03bc3/2\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhere m = 2\u03bc is the mass of an atom, ~\u03b40 is the energy difference between a molecule and\ntwo atoms, a is the off-resonant s-wave scattering length, \u03c1 is an invariant density equal to the\nsum of atom density and twice the molecular density, and \u0393(\u01eb) is the dissociation rate for a\nmolecule with the energy ~\u01eb above the threshold of the Feshbach resonance.\nTo address the validity of mean-field theory for near-resonant systems, we find the Heisenberg equation of motion for the molecular operator and solve it in the adiabatic limit: \u03c8 =\n\u221a\n[\u03a9/(2\u03b40 \u03c1)] \u03c6\u03c6 . Pluging this back into Eq. (1.1), gives\n\u0015\n\u0014\n2\u03c0~aef f \u2020 \u2020\nm\u03a92\nH\n.\n(1.3)\n=\n\u03c6 \u03c6 \u03c6\u03c6 ; aef f = a 1 \u2212\n~\nm\n4\u03c0~\u03b40 \u03c1a\n\n\f3\n\nThe detuning can of course written in terms of the magnetic field by introducing the difference\nin the magnetic moments of the resonant states \u2206\u03bc : ~\u03b40 = \u2206\u03bc (B \u2212 B0 ). Similarly, the\ncondensate coupling can be approximated as \u03a9 = [2\u03c0\u03c1|a|\u03bcma \u2206R /m]1/2 . Substituting these\nexpressions leads immediately to the standard way of writing the scattering length around the\nFeshbach resonance:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2206B\naef f = a 1 \u2212\n.\n(1.4)\nB \u2212 B0\nThe effective scattering length (1.4), was obtained by adiabatically eliminating the molecular field, i.e., by assuming \u03b40 \u226b 2\u03c0~a/m, \u03a9. Since the adiabatic approximation fails for\n\u03b40 \u2192 0 (B \u2192 B0 ), it is therefore the effective all-atom description that actually breaks\ndown when resonance is encountered [15], not mean-field theory. The validity of the mean\nfield approximation is determined by \u03c1|a|3 \u226a 1, which holds independent of the value of the\nmagnetic field. Including the molecular condensate dynamics provides a complete mean-field\ndescription of the near-resonant system.\nThat said, we expect the mean-field equations arising from the Hamiltonian (1.1) to suitably model the salient features of the JILA experiments. Switching to momentum space,\nonly zero-momentum atomic and molecular condensate modes are retained, represented by\nthe respective c-number amplitudes \u03b1 and \u03b2. We also take into account correlated pairs of\nnoncondensate atoms using a complex amplitude C(\u01eb), which represent pairs of noncondensate atoms in the manner of the Heisenberg picture expectation value hap a\u2212p i, with ~\u01eb\nbeing the relative\nR energy of the atoms. The normalization of our mean fields is such that\n|\u03b1|2 + |\u03b2|2 + d\u01eb |C(\u01eb)|2 = 1. We work from the Heisenberg equation of motion of the boson operators under the simplifying assumption that the noncondensate atoms pairs are only\nallowed to couple back to the molecular condensate, ignoring the possibility that noncondensate atoms associate to make noncondensate molecules. This neglect is justified to the\nextent that Bose enhancement favors transitions back to the molecular condensate. The final\nmean-field equations are [7]\ni\u03b1\u0307 =\ni\u03b2\u0307\n\n=\n\ni\u010a(\u01eb) =\n\n\u03a9\n\u2212 \u221a \u03b1\u2217 \u03b2,\n2\nZ\n\u221a\n\u03be\n\u03a9\nd\u01eb 4 \u01eb C(\u01eb),\n\u03b40 \u03b2 \u2212 \u221a \u03b1\u03b1 \u2212 \u221a\n2\n2\u03c0\n\u03be \u221a\n4\n\u01eb\u03b2 .\n\u01ebC(\u01eb) \u2212 \u221a\n2\u03c0\n\n(1.5)\n(1.6)\n(1.7)\n\nThe analog of the Rabi frequency for the rogue modes \u03be is inferred using Fermi\nGolden rule,\n\u221a\nwhich gives the dissociation rate for a positive-energy molecule as \u0393(\u01eb) = \u01eb \u03be 2 .\nNext the problem is reformulated in terms of two key parameters with the dimension of\nfrequency. The density-dependent frequency \u03c9\u03c1 = ~\u03c12/3 /m, has been identified before,\nalong with the operational significance that, once \u03a9 >\n\u223c \u03c9\u03c1 , rogue dissociation is expected\nto be a dominant factor in the dynamics [5, 6, 7]. Here it is convenient to define another\nprimary parameter with the dimension of frequency. Considering on-shell dissociation of\nmolecules to atoms with the\n\u221a relative energy \u01eb, the Wigner threshold law delivers a dissociation\nrate \u0393(\u01eb) such that \u0393(\u01eb)/ \u01eb converges to a finite limit for \u01eb \u2192 0; hence, we define 4\u039e =\n\n\f4\n\n1 Role of Molecular Dissociation in Feshbach-Interacting 85 Rb Condensates\n\n\u221a 2\n(lim\u01eb\u21920 \u0393(\u01eb)/ \u01eb ) , which indeed has the dimension of frequency. A combination of the\npreceeding equations gives the parameters in the mean-field equations as\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03a9 = 23/2 \u03c0 \u039e1/4 \u03c9\u03c13/4 , \u03be = 2 \u039e1/4 .\n(1.8)\nLastly, when the coupling to the continuum of noncondensate atom pairs is included, the\ncontinuum shifts the molecular state [19]. We have, of course, taken the dominant state pushing, and the related renormalization effects, into account in our calculations [16, 20]. Suffice it\nto say that we choose the bare detuning \u03b40 so that the renormalized detuning attains the desired\nvalue; hereafter, we use the symbol \u03b4 = \u2206\u03bc (B \u2212 B0 )/~ for the renormalized detuning, which\nis the parameter that is varied experimentally by changing the laser frequency in photoassociation, or the magnetic field in the Feshbach resonance. The position of the Feshbach resonance\nis [13] B0 = 154.9 G, and the difference in magnetic moments between bound molecules and\nfree atom pairs, \u2206\u03bc \u2248 2 \u03bcB (where \u03bcB is the Bohr magneton), is borrowed from 87 Rb [21].\nWe have estimated [16] \u039e = 5.29 \u00d7 109 s\u22121 , and thus \u03be = 381 s\u22121/4. Compared to the ensuing detunings \u03b4, the interactions energies between the atoms due to the background scattering\nlength a = 23.8 nm are immaterial. We therefore ignore atom-atom interactions unrelated\nto the Feshbach resonance, as well as the (unknown) atom-molecule and molecule-molecule\ninteractions.\n\nResults\nWe begin with the experiments [10] implementing a sweep of the magnetic field across the\nFeshbach resonance, which are of course a version of the Landau-Zener problem [5, 6, 22].\nAlthough a sweep of the detuning \u03b4 from above to below threshold at a rate slow compared to\nthe condensate coupling \u03a9 will move the system adiabatically from all atoms to all molecules,\nrogue dissociation will overtake coherent atom-molecule conversion when \u03a9 >\n\u223c \u03c9\u03c1 [5, 6, 7].\nNevermind that the JILA experiments sweep from below to above threshold, for a density\n\u03c1 = 1 \u00d7 1012 cm\u22123 the condensate coupling is \u03a9 = 1.93 \u00d7 105 s\u22121 \u2248 250 \u03c9\u03c1, and so rogue\ndissociation should seriously dominate. This is indeed the case (see Fig. 1.1). Apparently,\ncoherent conversion occurs not between atomic and molecular BEC, but between atomic BEC\nand dissociated atom pairs. Holding this thought, we conclude that mean-field theory indicates\nrogue dissociation as a primary sink of atoms in the Ref. [10] sweeps across the resonance.\nNext we consider the experiments [12] for which nontrivial electromagnetic coil technology was developed to create trapezoidal magnetic field pulses that bring the system near\u2013\nbut not across\u2013 resonance, hold for a given amount of time, and return to the original field\nvalue. Neglecting the burst, these remnant-focused experiments revealed a contradiction with\nthe conventional understanding of condensate loss: rather than a loss that increased monotonically with increasing interaction time, the results indicated a loss that increased with decreasing interaction time, until very short times were reached. The present mean-field approach\nworks similarly, as shown in Fig. 1.2. Our interpretation is that adiabaticity is again at play.\nAt very short pulse durations, increasing interaction time leads to increasing condensate loss,\nas expected. In contrast, as the time dependence of the pulse gets slower, the system eventually follows the pulse adiabatically, and returns close to the initial condensate state when the\npulse has passed.\n\n\f5\n\nFinally, we turn to the experiments [13] in which two trapezoidal pulses were applied\nto a 85 Rb condensate, and the fraction of remnant and burst atoms measured for a variable between-pulse time and magnetic-field amplitude. These experiments revealed coherent remnant-burst oscillations with amplitudes of up to \u223c 25%. As it happens, we have\nrecently predicted coherent oscillations between atoms and dissociated atom pairs in a roguedominated system, although we harbored doubts regarding any practical realization [7]. Casting these doubts aside, we consider a time dependent detuning (magnetic field) similar to\nFig. 2 of Ref. [13] [Fig. 1.3(a)], and determine the fraction of remnant condensate atoms,\nnoncondensate atoms, and molecules at the end of the pulse sequence as a function of the\nholding time between the two pulses [Fig. 1.3(b)]. Oscillations are seen with the amplitude of\nabout 15% between condensate and noncondensate atoms at the frequency of the molecular\nstate corresponding to the magnetic field during the holding period. The molecular fraction\nappears too small to account for the amplitude of the oscillations. In fact, what we termed\nmolecular frequency is the characteristic frequency of a coherent superposition of molecules\nand noncondensate atom pair. Here the oscillations, directly comparable to Fig. 4(a) in Ref.\n[13], are Ramsey fringes [23] in the evolution between an atomic condensate and a molecular\ncondensate dressed with noncondensate atom pairs.\nAlthough our rogue-dissociation ideas provide a neat qualitative explanation for the three\nexperiments we have discussed1 , in all fairness it must be noted that we have fallen short\nof a full quantitative agreement. We have therefore refined our renormalization techniques,\nextended our model to allow for Bose enhancement of the rogue modes, and included an\naverage over a Gaussian distribution of densities [20]. So far, we have only applied this full\nmodel to the double-pulse experiments [13], the results of which are shown in Fig. 1.4. Not\nonly do we find excellent agreement on the size of the experimental Ramsey fringes, but the\nfraction of molecular condensate (\u223c 5%) is now sufficient to explain the observed atom loss\n[8(3)%].\n\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated that a minimal mean-field model is sufficient to qualitatively explain a number of puzzling results in Feshbach-resonant systems [16]. Moreover,\nour refined model [20] gives near-perfect quantitative agreement with the double-pulse experiments [13], leaving little-to-no room for additional loss mechanisms. Collapsing-condensate\nphysics is therefore understood as a matter of rogue dissociation, which leads to strong losses\nin the threshold neighborhood, decreased remnant fraction for decreasing interaction time-\nuntil very short times are reached, and coherent remnant-burst oscillations. Ironically, the\nFeshbach resonance has led to a regime dominated by rogue dissociation, which apparently\ntends to counteract the production of a molecular condensate.\n1 If an explanation in terms of below-threshold molecular dissociation seems a bit odd, consider that energy need\nnot be conserved for transient processes where a time dependence is externally imposed on the system.\n\n\f6\n\n1 Role of Molecular Dissociation in Feshbach-Interacting 85 Rb Condensates\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe acknowledgements Neil Claussen and Eddy Timmermans for helpful discussions, and\nthe Academy of Finland (MM and KAS, projects 43336 and 50314), NSF (JJ, Grants PHY9801888 and PHY-0097974), and NASA (JJ, Grant NAG8-1428) for support.\n\nBibliography\n[1] H.
