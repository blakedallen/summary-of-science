We have collected one-dimensional raster-scan observations of the active star-forming region Sharpless\n171 (S171), a typical H ii region-molecular cloud complex, with the three spectrometers (LWS, SWS, and PHT-S)\non board ISO.

Introduction\nFar-infrared (FIR) spectroscopy of the interstellar medium\n(ISM) provides us a great deal of information on the nature of the ISM. For H ii regions, FIR forbidden lines are\nuseful tools to investigate the physical properties, such as\nthe electron density and elemental abundance. They are\nless subject to extinction and less sensitive to the electron temperature than optical forbidden lines. Rubin et\nal. (1994) described a semiempirical methodology to derive the electron density, the effective temperature for the\nionizing star, and the gas-phase heavy element abundance\nfrom FIR line emissions based on the ionization bounded\nmodels. In neutral regions, in which the gas is warmer than\nthe molecular gas observed in radio frequencies, the kinetic\ntemperature of atoms is high enough to excite FIR emission and a number of forbidden lines are emitted. In the\ninterface region between the ionized and molecular gas, intense far-ultraviolet (FUV)(6 eV < h\u03bd < 13.6 eV) photons\nphotodissociate molecules and photoionize heavy elements\nSend\noffprint\nrequests\nto:\nokada@astron.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp\n\nY.\n\nOkada,\n\ne-mail:\n\nwith ionization potential less than the Lyman limit. This\nregion is called the photodissociation region (PDR), where\nmost energy is emitted in the FIR lines and continuum.\nTheoretical models have been investigated for PDRs with\nvarious physical conditions (Tielens & Hollenbach 1985;\nHollenbach et al. 1991; Wolfire et al. 1990; Kaufman et al.\n1999; see Hollenbach & Tielens 1997 for a review). These\nmodels take account of the chemistry and the energy balance and predict the cooling line intensities from PDRs.\nIn this paper, we report the results of a spectroscopic\ninvestigation of Sharpless 171 (S171) with the Infrared\nSpace Observatory (ISO; Kessler et al. 1996). S171 is a\nlarge H ii region and is the main cloud associated with\nthe Cepheus OB4 stellar association (Yang & Fukui 1992).\nThe star cluster Be 59 located at the central portion of the\nnebulous region is the ionizing source of this region. It contains one O7 star and several later-type stars. The physical properties of the ionized gas have been investigated\nin radio continuum and recombination lines (e.g., Felli et\nal. 1977; Rossano et al. 1980; Harten et al. 1981). Yang\n& Fukui (1992) have mapped the large-scale molecular\ngas distribution with the 13 CO (J = 1\u20130) line, suggesting\n\n\fY.

The position of Be 59 is\nshown by the plus (+). The thick solid line indicates the\nline along which the present observations were carried out.\nthat Be 59 generates the ionization front on the surface of\ntwo dense molecular clumps (C1 and C2). They suggested\nfrom the dynamics of the molecular clumps that the dense\ngas is contacting with the continuum source and the ionization front is driving shocks into the C1 clump. S171 is\na typical transition region from ionized gas to molecular\nclouds. It has a scale of several tens arcminutes, which is\nappropriate for mapping observations in the FIR to study\nthe physical properties of the ionized gas and PDR complex.\nIn Sect. 2, the observations and the data reduction\nare described. The results are presented in Sect. 3 and\ndiscussed in Sect. 4. A summary is given in Sect. 5.\n\n2. Observations and data reduction\nWe made one-dimensional raster-scan observations of\nthe S171 region with the Long-Wavelength Spectrometer\n(LWS; Clegg et al. 1996), the Short-Wavelength\nSpectrometer (SWS; de Graauw et al. 1996), and the\nPHT Spectrometer (PHT-S; Lemke et al. 1996; Laureijs\net al. 2002) on board ISO. The one-dimensional rasterscan started from the position near Be 59 to the region\nof \u223c 5 pc from Be 59, which is spanned from the ionized gas to the molecular cloud (Fig. 1). The observations\nwere carried out at 24 positions (Table 1), each of which\nwas separated by 50\u2032\u2032 . The full grating scan mode AOT\nLWS01 was used in the LWS observations to cover the\nwavelength range from 43 to 197 \u03bcm with \u03bb/\u2206\u03bb \u223c 100\u2013\n300 (Gry et al. 2002). Four grating scans were carried\nout for each raster position with the spectral sampling\n\n50\n\n100\nWavelength [\u03bcm]\n\n150\n\n200\n\nFig. 2. LWS spectra of the 24 raster positions. The spectra\nare shifted in the y-axis for clarity from top (position 1)\nto bottom (position 24). One division mark in the y-axis\ncorresponds to 10\u22126 W m\u22122 \u03bcm\u22121 sr\u22121 .\nof a half of the resolution element. The total integration\ntime at a grating position was 2 sec. The LWS beam size\nwas 66\u2032\u2032 \u201386\u2032\u2032 , depending on the wavelength, which corresponded to 0.27 \u223c 0.35 pc at the distance of S171 of 850 pc\n(MacConnell 1968), and the beam overlapped with each\nother. The Off-Line Processing (OLP) version 10.1 data\nobtained from the ISO Archival Data Center were used for\nthe present study. The spectra were further processed by\nusing the ISO Spectral Analysis Package (ISAP1 ). After\nremoving remaining noises, the spectrum at each position was averaged over individual spectral scans. The long\nwavelength part of the LWS spectra of extended sources\nis affected by the presence of fringes in the continuum\n(Swinyard et al. 1998), therefore for \u03bb > 90 \u03bcm the spectra have been corrected for fringes using the procedure\nwithin ISAP. Finally, the extended source correction was\napplied and the fluxes were converted into surface brightness according to the beam size of the detectors.

(2002). The line\nintensities were obtained by Gaussian fits. The absolute\nflux calibration uncertainty is reported to be 10\u201320% for\npoint sources and 50% for extended sources (Gry et al.\n2002). The relative accuracy is assumed to be 30%, which\nwas estimated from the gaps in the signal levels of the\ndetectors.\nThe same positions were observed with the SWS and\nthe PHT-S. For the SWS observations the grating line\nprofile mode AOT SWS02 was used to observe [Si ii]\n35 \u03bcm and the H2 pure rotational transition (J = 5\u20133)\nat 9.66 \u03bcm. The aperture size was 20\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 33\u2032\u2032 and 14\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 20\u2032\u2032\nand the spectral resolution was about 1500 and 2000 for\nthe [Si ii] 35 \u03bcm and H2 9.66 \u03bcm lines, respectively (Leech\net al. 2002). The OLP 10.1 data were obtained from the\nISO Archival Data Center and used in the present study\nexcept for the data at the position 23 in Table 2, for which\nonly the processed data of version 9.1 were available. At\neach raster position one up-down grating scan was carried\nout with the total integration time of 200 sec. We used the\nISAP for further data processing and obtained the line intensities by Gaussian fits. The flux calibration accuracy is\nreported to be 7% and 22% for the H2 9.66 \u03bcm and [Si ii]\n35 \u03bcm lines, respectively, for point-like sources. The conversion factors for extended sources are estimated to be\naccurate within 10% (Leech et al. 2002).\n\nThe PHT-S had a resolving power of \u03bb/\u2206\u03bb \u223c 90 in\ntwo wavelength bands with the aperture size of 24\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 24\u2032\u2032 .\nThe data were reduced by the Phot-Interactive Analysis\n(PIA2 ) version 8.0. The total integration time was 128 sec\nat each raster position. The absolute flux calibration accuracy is about 10% or less for point sources (Laureijs et al.\n2002). Because of the low spectral resolution, we could not\napply Gaussian fits to estimate the line intensity. Instead,\nwe simply measured the flux of the detector channel at\nthe line center and subtracted the continuum estimated\nfrom the adjacent detectors.\n\n3.

The line intensities derived from different detectors\nare in agreement with each other within the estimated\nuncertainties. We use the weighted mean of the intensities\nfrom the two detectors in the following analysis. In the\ncase that the line was detected only by one detector with\nthe other being an upper limit, we adopted the intensity\nof the detected channel. [O iii] 88 \u03bcm was also observed by\ntwo adjacent detectors, SW5 and LW1. We used only the\nSW5 data for [O iii] 88 \u03bcm because of its higher spectral\nresolution. We have detected [Si ii] 35 \u03bcm and the H2 pure\nrotational transition at 9.66 \u03bcm in the SWS observations,\nwhile H2 9.66 \u03bcm and 6.9 \u03bcm (J = 7\u20135) were not detected\nat the 3\u03c3 level in any PHT-S spectra. Upper limits for\nthese lines in the PHT-S spectra were estimated from the\nuncertainties in the flux of the corresponding detectors.\nThe upper limits of the 9.66 \u03bcm line are compatible with\nthe SWS results except for position 21, where the discrepancy may be attributed to the difference in the aperture\nsize if the emission is highly peaked. The results of the\n\nFig. 4. PHT-S spectra (5.6\u201311.6 \u03bcm) of the 24 raster positions. The spectra are shifted in the y-axis for clarity\nfrom top (position 1) to bottom (position 24).

The\nerrors of the line intensities include both the fitting errors and the statistical errors of the baseline for the LWS\nand SWS data. Uncertainties in the absolute flux are not\nincluded in the errors in Tables 1 and 2. For the line emission less than 3 times the uncertainty (3\u03c3) we regard it as\nnon-detection and give 3\u03c3 as the upper limit.\nFigure 5 shows the spatial distributions of the line intensities as a function of the distance from Be 59, d. The\n[O i] lines and the [N ii] 122 \u03bcm line show spatial distributions similar to the 0.61GHz radio continuum flux (Fig. 6).\nThe intensities of these lines show maxima at d \u223c 1 pc and\n\u223c 4 pc, indicating the presence of high density gas at these\npositions. The [C ii] 158 \u03bcm, [Si ii] 35 \u03bcm, and H2 9.66 \u03bcm\nemissions also show a strong peak at \u223c 4 pc, but their\nintensity distributions become rather flat around \u223c 1 pc.\nThe [O iii] and [N iii] lines appear strong at d \u223c 1 pc and\nmonotonically decrease with d, indicating a decrease in\nthe abundance of the doubly ionized ions.\nThe coexistence of ionic lines of different ionization\ndegrees as well as neutral atomic and molecular lines indicates that the observed region contains gases of various\n\n\f6\n\nY.

In the following we attribute each observed line to three distinct physical phases, the highlyionized gas, the lowly-ionized gas and the PDR gas, and\ninvestigate the properties of each gas.\n\n3.1. Highly-ionized gas\n[O iii] 52 \u03bcm, 88 \u03bcm and [N iii] 57 \u03bcm originate from the\nhighly-ionized gas. The [O iii] 52 \u03bcm to 88 \u03bcm intensity\nratio is in general a function of the electron density and\ntemperature (Osterbrock 1989). However, this ratio is\ninsensitive to the electron temperature around 104 K,\nand the electron density can be estimated directly from\nthe observed ratio. The maximum extinction in the observed positions is estimated as \u03c4ext \u223c 0.1 at 52 \u03bcm\nbased on the 12 CO line intensity at the C1 cloud (Yang\n& Fukui 1992) and the standard dust model (Draine &\nLee 1984) with the conversion factor of 2.8 \u00d7 1020 H2\nmolecule K\u22121 km\u22121 s cm\u22122 (Mizutani et al. 2002, for details).

For the maximum [O iii] 88 \u03bcm intensity of \u223c\n7.5 \u00d7 10\u22127 W m\u22122 sr\u22121 , L becomes approximately 9 \u00d7\n(20 cm\u22123 /ne )2 pc. This thickness is comparable with the\nprojected size of S171 of several pc, suggesting that the\nhighly-ionized gas is associated with S171.\nThe [N iii] 57 \u03bcm to [O iii] 52 \u03bcm intensity ratio is also\ninsensitive to the temperature, and thus is a function of\nthe electron density and the abundance ratio of N++ and\nO++ (Mizutani et al. 2002). N and O have similar second ionization potential energies and both lines can be\nassumed to come from the same region. From the observed ratio of \u223c 0.4 at most positions, we derive the\nabundance ratio N++ /O++ as 0.23 or 0.29 for Te = 104 K\nand ne = 20 cm\u22123 or ne = 150 cm\u22123 , respectively. Taking\naccount of the relative flux calibration error of the LWS,\nwe estimate N++ /O++ = 0.2 \u00b1 0.1 for ne < 150 cm\u22123 .\nThis is in agreement with the value of about 0.2 at the\ngalactocentric distance Rgal = 8.5 kpc, which is estimated\nfrom 34 compact H ii regions located between Rgal = 0.3\nand 15 kpc (Mart\u0131\u0301n-Hern\u00e1ndez et al. 2002), and is also\nsimilar to the value of \u223c 0.19 of the core ionized gas in\nthe Carina nebula (Mizutani et al. 2002).\nAccording to Rubin et al. (1994) the effective temperature of the ionizing star can be estimated from the [N iii]\n57 \u03bcm to [N ii] 122 \u03bcm line ratio for the ionization bounded\ncondition. With Te = 104 K and ne < 150 cm\u22123 , we derive hN++ i/hN+ i \u223c 0.69\u20130.86 from the total intensities of\n[N iii] 57 \u03bcm and [N ii] 122 \u03bcm of the 24 positions. This\nindicates Teff \u223c 37000\u201337500 K of the ionization source,\nwhich is cooler of about 1000 K than that of the earliest\ntype star in the S171 region, O7 (Teff = 38500 K). The\n[N ii] 122 \u03bcm emission comes also from the diffuse ionized gas and the ionization bounded condition may not\nhold. Conversely an O7-type star can provide a sufficient\n\n1\n\n[OIII] 52 \u03bcm / [OIII] 88 \u03bcm\n\nFigure 7 shows that the observed ratio is approximately \u223c 0.6 except for position 24 where the detection\nof [O iii] 52 \u03bcm is marginal. The mean ratio 0.6 indicates\nne \u2243 20 cm\u22123 for Te = 104 K with the parameters for\nthe transition given in Osterbrock (1989). The low density limit of the ratio is 0.56 for Te = 104 K. The uncertainty in the collision coefficients leads to an uncertainty of\nabout 20% in the ratio at the low density limit (Mizutani\net al. 2002). The relative flux calibration error leads to an\nuncertainty of \u00b10.2 in the ratio. Taking account of these\nuncertainties, the upper limit at the electron density is estimated as 150 cm\u22123 . The lower limit is not constrained.\nThe derived range of the electron density (ne < 150 cm\u22123 )\nis about the same as that in the Carina region (ne < 100\ncm\u22123 ; Mizutani et al. 2002), indicating the presence of the\ndiffuse H ii region also in S171.

Neutral region\nThe [O i] 63 \u03bcm, 146 \u03bcm, [C ii] 158 \u03bcm, [Si ii] 35 \u03bcm, and\nH2 lines originate from the PDR, where the FUV flux is\nconverted into atomic and molecular gaseous line emissions by the photoelectric heating. We estimate the physical properties from the observed intensities of the line and\ncontinuum emission, using the PDR model by Kaufman et\nal. (1999). The major model parameters are the gas density, n, and the radiation field strength, G0 , in units of the\nsolar neighborhood (1.6\u00d710\u22126 W m\u22122 ; Habing 1968). The\nmodel gives integrated line intensities seen in the face-on\nview.\nFirst, we fit the continuum emission of the LWS spectra with a gray-body radiation as\n\u0013\u2212\u03b2\n\u0012\n\u03bb\nF (\u03bb) = \u03c4100 \u00d7\nB\u03bb (Td ) ,\n(2)\n100\u03bcm\nwhere Td is the dust temperature, \u03c4100 is the optical depth\nat 100 \u03bcm, B\u03bb is the Planck function, and \u03b2 is the powerlaw index of the emissivity on the wavelength. We assume\n\u03b2 = 1 because it gives the best fit. The obtained Td ranges\nfrom 34 K to 53 K and tends to decrease with the distance\nfrom Be 59.

We assume h\u03c4abs i/\u03c4100 = 700 (Okumura\n1999; Chan et al. 2001). In Fig. 8 the crosses with errorbars show the derived GUV . We also calculate GUV as\nL/4\u03c0d2 , where L (= 2.6 \u00d7 105 L\u2299 ) is the luminosity of\nan O7 type star (solid line in Fig. 8). Both estimates are\nroughly in agreement with each other for d > 2 pc. In the\nregion closer to the heating sources the estimate from the\nstellar luminosity becomes much larger. It suggests that\ndust grains emitting the FIR emission are not present in\nthe vicinity of Be 59. The agreement in the outer region\nsupports that Eq. (6) gives a reasonable estimate for GUV .\nIn the PDR model the parameter G0 does not include photons with the energy of < 6 eV, which do not contribute\nto the photoelectric heating. Thus G0 is given by\nG0 \u00d7 (1.6 \u00d7 10\u22126 W m\u22122 ) =\n\nZ\n\n2066\u00c5\n\n4\u03c0J\u03bb\u2217 d\u03bb .\n\nthe ionized gas. At d \u223c 4 pc, however, the observed [O i]\n146 \u03bcm is much stronger than the model prediction in case\n1 (Fig. 9c), or the model predicts too strong [O i] 63 \u03bcm\nin case 2 (Fig. 10c). The model also predicts the [C ii]\n158 \u03bcm intensity stronger than observed for d > 3.5 pc\n(case 2; Fig. 10d) or indicates that almost all the [C ii]\n158 \u03bcm emission comes from the PDR gas for d > 3.5 pc\n(case 1; Fig. 9d). The [N ii] 122 \u03bcm intensity shows a peak\nat d \u223c 4 pc and thus there should be a significant contribution to [C ii] 158 \u03bcm from the ionized gas that emits\n[N ii] 122 \u03bcm. Therefore the line intensities of [O i] 63 \u03bcm,\n146 \u03bcm and [C ii] 158 \u03bcm together with the FIR continuum\nemission can not be accounted for consistently by the latest PDR model in either case. In case 2 the gas density has\na peak at \u223c 4 pc (Fig. 10a), where CO observations indicate the presence of the main molecular clump C1 (Yang\n& Fukui 1992). On the other hand case 1 indicates a local\nminimum in the density and a peak in the temperature at\n\u223c 4 pc (Figs. 9a and b), neither of which is compatible\nwith the CO observations. Case 2 leads to more consistent\nresults with the CO observations (Figs. 10a and b). In the\nfollowing we assume case 2 gives correct results and discuss the discrepancy in the [O i] 63 \u03bcm and [C ii] 158 \u03bcm\nemission.\nAccording to the PDR model, [O i] 63 \u03bcm is optically\nthick, [C ii] 158 \u03bcm is marginally thick (\u03c4 \u223c 1), and [O i]\n146 \u03bcm and the FIR emission are optically thin in a PDR\n(Kaufman et al. 1999). The largest value of the derived\n\u03c4100 is \u223c 0.005, supporting that the FIR emission is optically thin in the PDR of S171. The optical depth effects of\nemission lines are taken into account in the PDR model. If\nseveral PDR clouds overlap with each other along the line\nof sight, however, the optically thick lines will be attenuated by foreground PDRs, while optically thin emissions\nwill be a simple summation of those from each PDR cloud.\nThe FIR intensity is estimated simply as 1.6 \u00d7\n10\u22126 GUV /4\u03c0 (W m\u22122 sr\u22121 ) in the PDR model by assuming that all the incident radiation is absorbed and converted into the FIR emission (Kaufman et al. 1999). Here\nwe define the overlapping factor Z as\n\n(7)\n\n912\u00c5\n\nFor an O7 type star with Teff = 38000 K, we estimate\nGUV /G0 = 1.3 and use this scaling in the following analysis.\n[C ii] 158 \u03bcm and [O i] 63 \u03bcm and 146 \u03bcm are the major cooling lines in the PDR. However [C ii] 158 \u03bcm comes\nalso from the ionized gas. We estimate the density n from\nG0 and either of the ratio [O i] 63 \u03bcm/F IR (case 1) or the\nratio [O i] 146 \u03bcm/F IR (case 2). With the estimated n, we\nderive the ratio [C ii] 158 \u03bcm/F IR, the surface temperature, and the ratio [O i] 146 \u03bcm/F IR or [O i] 63 \u03bcm/F IR,\nfor cases 1 or 2, respectively. The results are plotted in\nFigs. 9 and 10. In both cases the model predicts fairly\nwell for d < 3 pc the intensity of the other [O i] line that\nis not used for the input parameter, and always provides\na smaller intensity of [C ii] 158 \u03bcm than observed. The excess emission of [C ii] 158 \u03bcm is considered to come from\n\nZ=\n\n4\u03c0F IR\n1.6 \u00d7\n\n10\u22126 (W m\u22122\n\nsr\u22121 ) GUV\n\n.\n\n(8)\n\nFor Z < 1, Z is supposed to indicate the beam filling factor, whereas it should estimate the degree of overlapping\nof clouds for Z > 1 since the FIR emission is optically\nthin.\nFigure 11 plots the spatial variation of the ratio of the\nmodel prediction (case 2) to the observation for the [O i]\n63 \u03bcm/F IR ratio and Z. The two quantities are plotted\nin Fig. 12, indicating a good correlation. F IR and [O i]\n146 \u03bcm are not affected by overlapping because both emissions are optically thin (\u03c4 \u226a 1), and we assumed that the\nresults for case 2 can directly be used. The PDR model\npredicts the observed [O i] 63 \u03bcm/F IR ratio fairly well\n(model/observation \u223c 1) for the positions with Z < 1.\nFigure 11 shows that the regions of d > 3.5 pc have\nZ larger than unity, where the discrepancy between the\n\n\fY.

(9) if Z is shifted\nby \u221250% (dotted line). Such a shift can be attributed to\nthe uncertainty in the absolute scale of F IR and/or to the\nsimple assumption of the model.\nFor [C ii] 158 \u03bcm, we assume \u03c4 = 1 and apply Eq. (9)\nwith the shift of \u221250% in Z to the model results predicted\nfrom G0 and [O i] 146 \u03bcm/F IR. The discrepancy that the\nmodel intensity is stronger than the observations for [C ii]\n158 \u03bcm for d > 3.5 pc, is resolved by taking account of\nthe absorption due to the overlapping clouds. The resultant model prediction for the [C ii] 158 \u03bcm emission becomes less than those observed at all the positions. Then\nthe excess intensity in the observed [C ii] 158 \u03bcm over the\noverlapping model prediction can be ascribed to that from\nthe ionized gas. Figure 13 plots the thus estimated fraction\nof the [C ii] 158 \u03bcm emission from the ionized gas, indicating that a non-negligible fraction (20\u201370%) of the [C ii]\n158 \u03bcm emission comes from the ionized gas.

COBE observations suggest that the electron\ndensity of the [N ii] 122 \u03bcm emitting gas in the Galactic\nplane is typically 10\u201330 cm\u22123 (Wright et al. 1991), which\nis in agreement with the present estimate. We estimate\nthe path length of the N+ gas in the same manner as for\nthe O++ gas. With the strongest [N ii] 122 \u03bcm intensity\nof 2.9 \u00d7 10\u22128 W m\u22122 sr\u22121 and assuming Te = 104 K and\nthe solar abundance, we derive the length L = 4.2 and\n0.9 pc for ne = 30 and 70 cm\u22123 , respectively. Because of\nthe large uncertainty in ne due to the uncertainty in the\nabundance, it is difficult to conclude whether the lowlyionized gas is distributed in a thin sheet or extending over\nthe S171 region.\nThe observed [N ii] 122 \u03bcm and [Si ii] 35 \u03bcm intensities\ngive us an estimate of the gas phase silicon abundance.\nThe N abundance is assumed to be solar without depletion and the singly ionized ion fraction is assumed to be\nthe same for N and Si. Both lines are also assumed to originate from the same ionized region. Silicon and nitrogen\nhave quite different ionization potential energies. However,\nmodel calculations indicate that 81% of nitrogen is in N+\nand 91% of silicon is in Si+ in the warm ionized medium\n\n(WIM) owing to the charge exchange effect (Sembach et\nal. 2000). Taking account of the calculated ionization fractions the required silicon abundance is lowered by about\n10% compared to the assumption of the same ionization\nfraction. Figure 15 shows the observed intensities and the\nresults of the calculation. S171 shows strong silicon emission, which requires log (Si/H) = \u22124.99, 30 \u00b1 10% of solar\nabundance silicon in the gas phase for ne < 70 cm\u22123 .\nFigure 15 shows that the [Si ii] 35 \u03bcm emission is\nwell correlated with the [N ii] 122 \u03bcm emission except for\nthe two positions where the [Si ii] 35 \u03bcm emission is the\nstrongest. This correlation suggests that the [Si ii] 35 \u03bcm\nemission originates mainly from the [N ii] 122 \u03bcm emitting gas. Observations of the Carina region by Mizutani\net al. (2000) also suggest a good correlation between [Si ii]\n35 \u03bcm and [N ii] 122 \u03bcm, indicating that the [Si ii] 35 \u03bcm\nemission comes mostly from the ionized gas. The strong\n[Si ii] 35 \u03bcm emission of the two points, d \u223c 4 pc, may be\nattributed to the contribution from the PDR or the high\nelectron density gas.\nThe [Si ii] 35 \u03bcm line has a high critical density (2.6 \u00d7\n105 cm\u22123 ) for the H0 collision and a high exciting temperature (413 K). Hence, in the neutral region the [Si ii]\n35 \u03bcm emission indicates the presence of high-temperature\nand high-density gas. In Sect. 3.2, the density of the PDR\nin S171 is estimated to be 100\u20131500 cm\u22123 and the temperature is 200 K\u2013400 K. These properties indicate that the\n[Si ii] 35 \u03bcm emission from the PDR should not be significant as Fig. 15 indicates. Based on the comparison of the\nobserved [Si ii] 35 \u03bcm emission with the PDR model by\nHollenbach et al. (1991), we found that we need by about\n12 times larger silicon abundance in the gas than that assumed in the PDR model (about 2% of solar abundance) if\n\n\f12\n\nY. Okada et al.: Infrared spectroscopy of Sharpless 171\n\nthe strongest [Si ii] 35 \u03bcm emission (d \u223c 4 pc) comes only\nfrom the PDR. The [Si ii] 35 \u03bcm emission should also be\nattenuated by overlapping clouds because of its large optical depth. Taking account of this effect, we estimate that\nsilicon of 65 \u00b1 20% of solar abundance must be in the gas\nphase in the PDR at \u223c 4 pc. If a half of the [Si ii] 35 \u03bcm\nemission at \u223c 4 pc comes from the ionized gas and the\nother half from the PDR, then both regions need gaseous\nsilicon of about 30% of solar abundance. Therefore the\nlarge Si abundance in the gas in the S171 region is a secure conclusion.\nIntense [Si ii] emission has been reported in several H ii\nregions (Haas et al. 1991), in the Galactic center region\n(Stolovy et al. 1995), and in the Carina region (Mizutani\net al. 2000). Silicon and carbon are major constituents\nof interstellar grains (Mathis 1990). The gas phase Si\nabundance is about 5% of solar in cool clouds (Savage &\nSembach 1996) and the depleted atoms are thought to reside in interstellar grains. The suggested large abundance\nof gaseous silicon in PDRs or H ii regions indicates efficient grain destruction processes taking place in these\nregions. Observations of the massive star-forming region\nthe Carina nebula indicate the ratio of [Si ii] 35 \u03bcm to\n[N ii] 122 \u03bcm of about 8 (Mizutani et al. 2000), while it is\nabout 4 in S171. In both regions, the estimated electron\ndensity is in a similar range (10\u201350 cm\u22123 ) and thus the\ndifference in the ratio can be attributed to the difference\nin the relative abundance. Observations of the starburst\ngalaxy NGC 253 also indicate that about a half of the solar\nabundance Si should be in the gas (Carral et al. 1994). The\npresent result indicates a slightly smaller value of \u223c 30%.\nThe degree of destruction may indicate the difference in\nthe activity of the regions. Theoretical investigations suggest that dust grains are destroyed quite efficiently by supernova shocks in a time scale of 2\u20134 \u00d7 108 yr (Jones\net al. 1994, 1996). Observations by the Goddard High\nResolution Spectrograph (GHRS) on board the Hubble\nSpace Telescope have indicated that Si returns to the gas\nphase relatively quickly, while Fe grains seem to be more\nresistive (Fitzpatrick 1996, 1997). The present observations support these results and indicate that Si in dust\ngrains is easily returned to the gas phase. This is in contrast to the constant gas abundance suggested for oxygen and carbon (Cardelli et al. 1996; Sofia et al. 1997;\nCartledge et al. 2001). The recycling as well as the composition of dust grains in interstellar space should be reexamined based on these recent results of the gas abundance in\nvarious phases (cf. Tielens 1998; Jones 2000; Onaka 2000).\n\n4. Discussion\n4.1. The absorption of [ O i] 63 \u03bcm and [ C ii] 158 \u03bcm\nIn the S171 region, strong [O i] 146 \u03bcm emission is observed compared to [O i] 63 \u03bcm at \u223c 4 pc, where the ratio\nof [O i] 63 \u03bcm/146 \u03bcm is about 5. Small ratios compared\nto the PDR model prediction have been reported also in\nother objects. Liseau et al. (1999) showed that the ratio\n\nbecomes 1\u20135 in the \u03c1 Oph cloud and were not able to identify any convincing mechanisms to explain the discrepancy. They took account of the collisional excitation at low\ntemperatures and examined the collision coefficients of O0\nin detail. The model prediction based on the newly-derived\ncollision parameters, however, did not make a significant\ndifference from the older one. Thus the uncertainty in the\ncollision coefficients is not a major factor for the low [O i]\n63 \u03bcm to 146 \u03bcm ratio. The 3 P1 and 3 P0 levels in O i can\nbe populated by cascades from higher states that have\nbeen populated from 3 P2 through the absorption of the\nUV interstellar radiation (Keenan et al. 1994). With the\noscillator strengths given by Morton (1991) we calculated\nthe detailed balance of O i level populations including this\neffect. The UV pumping is effective at low hydrogen densities (e.g. nH < 1000 cm\u22123 and T < 1000 K) and the [O i]\n63 \u03bcm to 146 \u03bcm ratio becomes smaller than 15 for temperatures of several hundred K. Taking account of the possible optical depth effect, this process can account partly for\nthe obtained low ratio. However, the low ratio is observed\nat the surface of the molecular region, while the UV pumping is expected to be effective in the vicinity of the star.\nThe spatial distribution of the line ratio suggests that the\nUV pumping is not a major mechanism for the low ratio.\nAs described in Sect. 3.1, dust extinction does not affect\nthe observed line intensity for \u03bb > 50 \u03bcm and thus does\nnot affect the observed [O i] line ratio. Caux et al. (1999)\nclaimed that the low value of [O i] 63 \u03bcm to 146 \u03bcm in the\n\u03c1 Oph cloud is due to the presence of a very large column\ndensity of atomic oxygen, which makes the 63 \u03bcm line optically thick. Giannini et al. (2000) showed that the complex site of massive star formation, NGC 2024 (Orion B,\nW12), has the [O i] 63 \u03bcm to 146 \u03bcm ratio of about 5 and\nsuggested that the [O i] 63 \u03bcm line is strongly absorbed\nby the cold foreground gas. Absorption of the [O i] 63 \u03bcm\nline has been reported directly by high spectral resolution\nKAO observations toward star-forming regions (Poglitsch\net al. 1996; Kraemer et al. 1998), and by ISO/LWS observations toward Sagittarius B2 (Baluteau et al. 1997) and\nW49N (Vastel et al. 2000).\nCarbon atoms are in CO in cold molecular clouds, and\nthus the [C ii] 158 \u03bcm emission will not be absorbed in cool\nclouds as efficiently as [O i] 63 \u03bcm. However, [C ii] 158 \u03bcm\nis marginally optically thick, \u03c4 \u223c 1, in the PDR (Kaufman\net al. 1999). Boreiko & Betz (1995) observed NGC 6334\nat high spectral resolution with the KAO and indicated a\nself-absorption profile of the [C ii] 158 \u03bcm emission at several positions. NGC 6334 is a star-forming region where\nself-absorption of [O i] 63 \u03bcm is also observed (Kraemer\net al. 1998). Boreiko & Betz (1997) further directly detected the absorption feature of [C ii] 158 \u03bcm in the starforming region, NGC 3576, and suggested that the [C ii]\n158 \u03bcm emission is absorbed by a foreground cloud. The\npresent analysis indicates that the model of overlapping\nPDR clouds accounts for observations sufficiently well.\nThe resultant [C ii] 158 \u03bcm emission from the ionized gas\nis in the reasonable range, supporting the present simple\nmodel. A detailed study of the \u03c1 Oph region, where the\n\n\fY. Okada et al.: Infrared spectroscopy of Sharpless 171\n\ncontribution to [C ii] 158 \u03bcm from the ionized gas is negligible and thus the observed line intensities can be more\ndirectly compared to model predictions, also suggests that\nthe [O i] 63 \u03bcm, 146 \u03bcm, and [C ii] 158 \u03bcm intensities are\nable to be accounted for consistently by the present model\nwith the overlapping factor (Okada et al. 2003).\nThese results suggest that the absorption of [O i] 63 \u03bcm\nand [C ii] 158 \u03bcm in clouds on the line of sight is the most\nlikely cause for the difference between the PDR model\npredictions and the present observations. The overlapping model does not necessarily assume separate clumpy\nclouds, but can also be applied if a thick cloud is viewed in\nan edge-on configuration. In the PDR model by Kaufman\net al. (1999), the turbulent velocity dispersion is assumed\nto be 1.5 km s\u22121 , which corresponds to the line width of\n2.5 km s\u22121 in FWHM. In S171, the 13 CO emission seems\nto have two components, one with the width of 1.0 km s\u22121\nand the other with 3.4 km s\u22121 width (Yang & Fukui 1992).\nThus if the clouds are overlapping, self-absorption in [O i]\n63 \u03bcm and [C ii] 158 \u03bcm can be expected to some extent\nin S171. The validity of the present model of overlapping PDRs can be examined in detail by high spectralresolution observations. The present analysis suggests that\nthe best diagnostic line for PDRs is [O i] 146 \u03bcm, and that\nF IR is an important parameter to estimate the degree of\nthe overlapping on the line of sight.\n\n4.2. Comparison with observations of other H ii\nregions\nObservations of compact H ii regions suggest that\ntheir electron density is in the range 200\u201310000 cm\u22123\n(Moorwood et al. 1980; Watson et al. 1981; Mart\u0131\u0301nHern\u00e1ndez et al. 2002). Observations of G29.96-0.02 suggest the presence of a dense (ne \u223c 57000 cm\u22123 ) core and a\ndiffuse component (ne \u223c 680 cm\u22123 ; Morisset et al. 2002).\nThe H ii region-molecular cloud complex of NGC 2024 has\nbeen shown to have ne = 1200\u20131500 cm\u22123 (Giannini et\nal. 2000). The present results of S171 indicate the lower\nend of the electron density in the range of these observations, suggesting the presence of the diffuse H ii region in\nS171. This is supported by the extended distribution of\nthe [O iii] and [N iii] lines over several pc. Observations of\nthe Carina nebula also indicate the presence of the lowdensity (< 100 cm\u22123 ) highly-ionized gas extending over\nseveral tens pc (Mizutani et al. 2002). The presence of\nlow-density highly-ionized gas in star-forming regions may\nnot be an uncommon phenomenon.\nIn the Carina nebula, however, the [O i] 63 \u03bcm emission is weak and is about one third of the [C ii] 158 \u03bcm\nemission. The [O i] 146 \u03bcm emission is also weak and has\nbeen detected only at several positions (Mizutani et al.\n2000). Compared to the Carina nebula, S171 has a large\nneutral gas density. On the other hand, observations of\nNGC 2024 suggest a much higher density (\u223c 5 \u00d7 105 \u2013106\ncm\u22123 ) for the PDR (Giannini et al. 2000). S171 may be at\n\n13\n\nthe middle stage in between dense and young star-forming\nregions and evolved diffuse PDRs.\nThe fraction of the [C ii] emission from the ionized gas\nis suggested to be less than 30% both in the NGC 2024\nand the Carina regions. The present observations suggest\na higher ratio of 20\u201370% of the [C ii] emission that comes\nfrom the ionized gas. This ratio has a large uncertainty\nbecause it depends on the overlapping model, but if real,\nthe large fraction may be partly due to the geometrical\neffect: in S171 the ionized gas and PDR overlap on the line\nof sight with a large degree. Observations of the gas motion\nshould provide useful information to further investigate\nthe geometry of the S171 region.\n\n5. Summary\nWe observed S171 with the LWS, the SWS, and the PHTS on board ISO. We have detected 7 forbidden lines,\n[O iii] 52 \u03bcm, [N iii] 57 \u03bcm, [O i] 63 \u03bcm, [O iii] 88 \u03bcm, [N ii]\n122 \u03bcm, [O i] 146 \u03bcm, and [C ii] 158 \u03bcm, and far-infrared\ncontinuum with the LWS, [Si ii] 35 \u03bcm and H2 9.66 \u03bcm\nwith the SWS. The PHT-S observations gave only upper\nlimits on the H2 9.66 \u03bcm and 6.9 \u03bcm lines. We attribute\nthe observed lines to three phases \u2013 highly-ionized gas,\nlowly-ionized gas, and PDR gas \u2013 and derived the physical properties of each phase.\nFor the highly-ionized gas, we have estimated the electron density from the [O iii] lines as ne < 150 cm\u22123 . The\npath length of the O++ gas along the line of sight is estimated to be 9 \u00d7 (20 cm\u22123 /ne )2 pc, indicating that the\nhighly-ionized gas is associated with S171. The abundance\nratio of N++ /O++ is 0.2 \u00b1 0.1, in agreement with the observed ratio of H ii regions at the galactocentric distance\nof about 8 kpc.\nThe [O i] 63 \u03bcm, 146 \u03bcm and [C ii] 158 \u03bcm line intensities around the interface region between the ionized and\nmolecular gases cannot be accounted for consistently by\nthe current PDR model. The [O i] 146 \u03bcm emission is very\nstrong, and the [O i] 63 \u03bcm to 146 \u03bcm ratio is too small.\nThe [C ii] 158 \u03bcm emission also seems to be too weak.\nWe conclude that the model based on the observed [O i]\n146 \u03bcm/F IR ratio gives the most consistent results with\nthe other observations. We propose a model in which the\n[O i] 63 \u03bcm and [C ii] 158 \u03bcm emissions are attenuated by\noverlapping PDR clouds. We introduce the overlapping\nfactor Z defined as the ratio of the observed F IR to the\nfar-infrared intensity of a PDR cloud estimated from the\ntemperature of the FIR continuum emission. The observed\nintensities of the three lines can be accounted for by the\nsimple model of overlapping PDRs. We obtain the gas density n \u223c 100\u20131500 cm\u22123 and the temperature T \u223c 200\u2013\n400 K. The present analysis indicates that the [O i] 63 \u03bcm\nline emission must be used with caution in diagnostics of\nPDRs and the [O i] 146 \u03bcm line may be the best parameter for the diagnostics. A comparison of the observations\nwith the model prediction indicates that 20\u201370% of the\n[C ii] 158 \u03bcm comes from the ionized gas.\n\n\f14\n\nY. Okada et al.: Infrared spectroscopy of Sharpless 171\n\nWe have obtained the electron density ne = 30+40\n\u221220\ncm\u22123 for the solar abundance or less than 10 cm\u22123 for\nthe ISM abundance for the lowly-ionized gas. [Si ii] 35 \u03bcm\nis quite strong and the observed ratio of [Si ii] 35 \u03bcm to\n[N ii] 122 \u03bcm indicates the silicon abundance in the diffuse\nionized gas to be about 30% of solar. This value is much\nlarger than the typical value in interstellar diffuse clouds\n(\u223c 5% of solar), suggesting the efficient dust destruction\nin the ionized region. The present observations indicate\nthe importance of the [Si ii] line in future observations to\ninvestigate the dust destruction and the circulation processes of the interstellar medium.\nAcknowledgements.
