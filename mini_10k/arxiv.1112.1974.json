Subj. Class.: 55M10 (54F45 55N45)\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThroughout this paper we assume that maps are continuous and spaces are separable\nmetrizable. We recall that a compactum means a compact metric space. By dimension of\na space dim X we assume the covering dimension.\nClearly, the dimension of the product of two polyhedra equals the sum of the dimension: dim(K \u00d7 L) = dim K + dim L. In 1930 Pontryagin discovered that this logarithmic\nlaw does not hold for compacta [16]. He constructed his famous Pontryagin surfaces \u03a0p\nindexed by prime numbers, dim \u03a0p = 2, such that dim(\u03a0p \u00d7 \u03a0q ) = 3 whenever p 6= q. In\nthe 80s the first author showed that the dimension of the product can deviate arbitrarily\nfrom the sum of the dimension. Namely, for any n, m, k \u2208 N with\nmax{n, m} + 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n + m\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nthe first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-0904278;\nthe second author was supported by ISF grant 836/08\n\n1\n\n\fthere are compacta Xn and Xm of dimensions n and m respectively with dim(Xn \u00d7Xm ) =\nk [2]. We note that the inequality dim(X \u00d7 Y ) \u2264 dim X + dim Y always holds true.\nThe first author conjectured that many classical formulas (inequalities) of dimension\ntheory can be strengthen by replacing the sum of the dimensions by the dimension of\nthe product. His believe was based on his results on the general position properties of\ncompacta in euclidean spaces [5],[8]. Clearly, for two polyhedra K and L with transversal\nintersection in Rn we have dim(K \u2229 L) = n \u2212 (dim K + dim L). For compacta the\ncorresponding formula is dim(X \u2229 Y ) = n \u2212 dim(X \u00d7 Y ). In particular, two compacta X\nand Y in general position in Rn have empty intersection if and only if dim(X \u00d7 Y ) < n.\nThe next candidate for the improvement was the following classical theorem of Hurewicz.\nTheorem 1.1 (Hurewicz Theorem) Let f : X \u2212\u2192 Y be a map of compacta. Then\ndim X \u2264 dim Y + dim f\nwhere dim f = sup{dim f \u22121 (y) | y \u2208 Y }.\nWe note that the Hurewicz theorem applied to the projection X \u00d7 Y \u2192 Y implies the\ninequality dim(X \u00d7 Y ) \u2264 dim X + dim Y . The first author proposed the following conjecture.\nConjecture 1.2 ([8]) For a map of compacta f : X \u2212\u2192 Y\ndim X \u2264 sup{dim(Y \u00d7 f \u22121 (y)) | y \u2208 Y }.\nNote that the Conjecture 1.2 holds true for nice maps like locally trivial bundles. It\nwas known that the conjecture holds true when X is standard (compactum of type I in\nthe sense of [12]). We call a compactum X standard if it has the property dim(X \u00d7 X) =\n2 dim X. It's not easy to come with an example of a compactum without this property.\nThe Pontryagin surfaces satisfy it. First example of a non-standard compactum was\nconstructed by Boltyanskii [1]. In this paper all non-standard compacta (compacta of\ntype II in [12]) will be called Boltyanskii compacta. It is known that for all Boltyanskii\ncompacta dim(X \u00d7 X) = 2 dim X \u2212 1.\nIn this paper we disprove Conjecture 1.2. We will refer to the maps providing counterexamples to the conjecture as exotic maps.\nPositive results towards Conjecture 1.2 can be summarized in the following:\nTheorem 1.3 If a compactum X admits an exotic map f : X \u2192 Y then X is a Boltyanskii compactum. For every exotic map f : X \u2192 Y we have\ndim X = sup{dim(Y \u00d7 f \u22121 (y)) | y \u2208 Y } + 1.\nAnother classical result in Dimension Theory where the first author hoped to replace\nthe sum of the dimensions by the dimension of the product was the Menger-Urysohn\nFormula.\n2\n\n\fTheorem 1.4 ( Menger-Urysohn Formula) Let X = A \u222a B be a decomposition of a\nspace X. Then dim X \u2264 dim A + dim B + 1.\nProblem 1.5 ( [5]) Does the inequality dim X \u2264 dim(A \u00d7 B) + 1 hold true for an arbitrary decomposition of compact metric space X = A \u222a B?\nIn this paper we answer Problem 1.5 in the negative and, similarly to the terminology\nused above, we refer to the decompositions providing counterexamples to Problem 1.5 as\nexotic decompositions. To a certain extent exotic decompositions is a starting point of\nour construction of exotic maps.\nNote that in the case of non-compact X a counter example to Problem 1.5 was constructed by Jan van Mill and Roman Pol. They proved the following.\nTheorem 1.6 ([14]) There is a 3-dimensional subset X \u2282 R4 admitting a decomposition\nX = A \u222a B such that dim(A \u00d7 B)n = 1 for every integer n > 0.\nSimilarly to the case of Conjecture 1.2 the following facts were known about Problem 1.5.\nTheorem 1.7 ([5])) If a compactum X admits an exotic decomposition then X is a\nBoltyanskii compactum. For any exotic decomposition X = A \u222a B of a compactum X we\nhave dim X = dim(A \u00d7 B) + 2.\nThe main results of this paper are the following theorems.\nTheorem 1.8 Every finite dimensional Boltyanskii compactum X with dim X \u2265 5 admits\nan exotic decomposition.\nTheorem 1.9 For every n \u2265 4 there is an n-dimensional Boltyanskii compactum X\nadmitting an exotic map f : X \u2212\u2192 Y to a 2-dimensional compactum Y .\nTheorem 1.9 is derived from a more general result.\nTheorem 1.10 Every n-dimensional Boltyanskii compactum X with n \u2265 5 and dimQ X <\nn \u2212 3 admits an exotic map f : X \u2212\u2192 Y to an m-dimensional compactum Y with\nm = dimQ X + 1.\nNote that no compactum of dim < 4 admits an exotic map and no compactum of dim <\n5 admits an exotic decomposition, see Section 4. A further development of the approach\npresented in the paper allows one to partially generalize Theorem 1.10 by showing that\nany finite dimensional Boltyanskii compactum X with dim X \u2265 6 admits an exotic map.\nThis result is technically more complicated and will appear elsewhere. It still remains\nopen whether any Boltyanski compactum of dimensions 4 and 5 admits an exotic map.\nThe paper is built as follows: Bockstein Theory is reviewed in Section 2; Section 3\nis devoted to basic facts of Extension Theory with applications to Dimension Types; in\nSection 4 we consider the so-called compactly represented spaces, prove Theorem 1.8 and\npresent short proofs for Theorems 1.3 and 1.7; and, finally, Theorems 1.9 and 1.10 are\nproved in Section 5.\n3\n\n\f2\n\nBockstein Theory\n\nWe recall some basic facts of Bockstein Theory. The first detailed presentation of the\ntheory was given in the survey [12]. Since then it was evolved in many papers and surveys\n[2],[7],[6],[5],[17],[10]. Our presentation here has features of both point of view on the\nsubject, classical and modern.\nWe remind that cohomology always means the Cech cohomology. Let G be an abelian\ngroup. The cohomological dimension dimG X of a space X with respect to the coefficient group G does not exceed n, dimG X \u2264 n if H n+1 (X, A; G) = 0 for every closed\nA \u2282 X. We note that this condition implies that H n+k (X, A; G) = 0 for all k \u2265 1 [12],[6].\nThus, dimG X = the smallest integer n \u2265 0 satisfying dimG X \u2264 n and dimG X = \u221e\nif such an integer does not exist. Clearly, dimG X \u2264 dimZ X \u2264 dim X. Note that\ndimG X = 0 for a non-degenerate group G if and only if dim X = 0.\nTheorem 2.1 (Alexandroff) dim X = dimZ X if X is a finite dimensional space.\nLet P denote the set of all primes. The Bockstein basis is the collection of groups\n\u03c3 = {Q, Zp , Zp\u221e , Z(p) | p \u2208 P} where Zp = Z/pZ is the p-cyclic group, Zp\u221e = dirlimZpk\nis the p-adic circle, and Z(p) = {m/n | n is not divisible by p} \u2282 Q is the p-localization of\nintegers.\nThe Bockstein basis of an abelian group G is the collection \u03c3(G) \u2282 \u03c3 determined by\nthe rule:\nZ(p) \u2208 \u03c3(G) if G/TorG is not divisible by p;\nZp \u2208 \u03c3(G) if p-TorG is not divisible by p;\nZp\u221e \u2208 \u03c3(G) if p-TorG 6= 0 is divisible by p;\nQ \u2208 \u03c3(G) if G/TorG 6= 0 is divisible by all p.\nThus \u03c3(Z) = {Z(p) | p \u2208 P}.\nTheorem 2.2 (Bockstein Theorem) For a compactum X,\ndimG X = sup{dimH X : H \u2208 \u03c3(G)}.\nThe Alexandroff and Bockstein theorems imply that for finite dimensional compacta\nX\ndim X = max{dimZ(p) X | p \u2208 P}.\nWe call a space X p-regular if\ndimZ(p) X = dimZp X = dimZp\u221e X = dimQ X\nand call it p-singular otherwise.\nThe restrictions on the values of cohomological dimension of a given space with respect\nto Bockstein groups usually are stated in the form of Bockstein inequalities [12]. Here we\nstate them in a form of the equality and the alternative (see [6]).\n4\n\n\fTheorem 2.3 I. For every p-singular space X and every prime p\ndimZ(p) X = max{dimQ X, dimZp\u221e X + 1}.\nII. (Alternative) For every p-singular space X and every prime p either\ndimZp\u221e X = dimZp X\n\ndimZp\u221e X = dimZp X \u2212 1.\n\nor\n\nIn the first case of the alternative we call X p+ -singular and in the second, p\u2212 -singular.\nThus, the values of dimF X for Bockstein fields F \u2208 {Zp , Q} together with p-singularity\ntypes of X determine the value dimG X for all groups.\nWe notice that he Alexandroff theorem, the Bockstein theorem, and Theorem 2.3\nimply the following.\nCorollary 2.4 For every finite dimensional compactum X there is a field F such that\ndim X \u2264 dimF X + 1.\nA function f : \u03c3 \u2212\u2192 N \u222a {0, \u221e} is called a p-regular if f (Z(p) ) = f (Zp ) = f (Zp\u221e ) =\nf (Q) and it is called p-singular if f (Z(p) ) = max{f (Q), f (Zp\u221e ) + 1}. A p-singular function\nf is called p+ -singular if f (Zp\u221e ) = f (Zp ) and it is called p\u2212 -singular if f (Zp\u221e ) = f (Zp )\u22121.\nA function D : \u03c3 \u2212\u2192 N \u222a {0, \u221e} is called a dimension type if for every prime p it is either\np-regular or p\u00b1 -singular. For every space X the function dX : \u03c3 \u2212\u2192 N \u222a {0, \u221e} defined\nas dX (G) = dimG X is a dimension type. If X is compactum dX is called the dimension\ntype of X. We denote dim D = sup{D(G) | G \u2208 \u03c3}.\nTheorem 2.5 (Dranishnikov Realization Theorem [2],[4]) For every dimension\ntype D there is a compactum X with dX = D and dim X = dim D.\nLet D be a dimension type. We will use abbreviation D(0) = D(Q), D(p) = D(Zp ).\nAdditionally, if D(p) = n \u2208 N we will write D(p) = n+ if D is p+ -regular and D(p) = n\u2212\nif it is p\u2212 -regular. For p-regular D we leave it without decoration: D(p) = n. Thus, any\nsequence of decorated numbers D(p) \u2208 N, where p \u2208 P \u222a {0} define a unique dimension\ntype. There is a natural order on decorated numbers\n. . . < n\u2212 < n < n+ < (n + 1)\u2212 < . . . .\nNote that the inequality of dimension types D \u2264 D \u2032 as functions on \u03c3 is equivalent to the\nfamily of inequalities D(p) \u2264 D \u2032 (p) for the above order for all p \u2208 P \u222a {0}. The natural\ninvolution on decorated numbers that exchange the decorations '+' and '-' keeping the\nbase fixed defines an involution \u2217 on the set of dimension types . Thus, \u2217 takes p+ -singular\nfunction D to p\u2212 -singular D \u2217 and vise versa.\nBy Alexandroff and Bockstein theorems it follows that for any compactum X of\ndim X = n < \u221e there is a prime p such that dim X = dimZ(p) X. Then either dX (0) = n\nor dX (p) equals one of the following: n or n\u2212 or (n \u2212 1)+ . Let PX denote the set of all\nsuch primes.\nThe Bockstein Product Theorem [12] gives the formulas for cohomological dimension\nof the product with respect to each of the groups G \u2208 \u03c3 which are huge for some of G.\nHere we state it in an alternative way (see [6],[17],[10]).\n5\n\n\fTheorem 2.6 (Bockstein Product Theorem) For every field F and any two compacta,\ndimF (X \u00d7 Y ) = dimF X + dimF Y.\nFor every prime p the type of p-singularity is preserved by multiplication by a p-regular\ncompactum, and the following rule is applied in the remaining cases:\np+ -singular \u00d7 p+ -singular = p+ -singular;\np\u2212 -singular \u00d7 p\u00b1 -singular= p\u2212 -singular.\nThe product formula implies that an n-dimensional compactum X is a Boltyanskii compactum if and only if dX (0) < n and dX (p) = (n \u2212 1)+ for all p \u2208 PX . For every n \u2265 2\nwe denote by Bn , the \"maximal\" dimension type of Boltyanskii compacta of dimension n.\nThus, Bn (p) = (n \u2212 1)+ for all p \u2208 P and Bn (Q) = n \u2212 1. This implies that Bn (Z(p) ) = n\nfor every prime p and Bn (G) = n \u2212 1 for all other groups in \u03c3.\nCorollary 2.7 ([5]) For an n-dimensional compactum X the following are equivalent:\n\u2022 X is a Boltyanskii compactum;\n\u2022 dim X > dimF X for every field F ;\n\u2022 dX (G) \u2264 Bn (G) for all G \u2208 \u03c3.\nA finite dimensional compactum X is standard if and only if there is a field F \u2208 \u03c3\nsuch that dim X = dimF X.\nLet D1 and D2 be dimension types. The dimension type D1 \u229e D1 is defined by the\nformulas of the Bockstein Product Theorem: (D1 \u229e D2 )(G) = dimG (X \u00d7 Y ) with dimG X\nand dimG Y being replaced by D1 (G) and D2 (G) respectively for G \u2208 \u03c3 (see [7]). Thus\nwe have that dX\u00d7Y = dX \u229e dY for compacta X and Y . If D1 (p) = n\u01eb1 and D2 (p) = m\u01eb2\nwhere \u01ebi is a decoration, i.e., '+' or '-' or empty, then\n(D1 \u229e D2 )(p) = (n + m)\u01eb1 \u2297\u01eb2\nwith the product of the signs \u01eb1 \u2297 \u01eb2 defined by the Bockstein Product Theorem rule:\n\u01eb \u2297 empty = \u01eb,\n\n\u01eb \u2297 \u01eb = \u01eb, \u01eb = \u00b1,\n\nand\n\n+ \u2297\u2212 = \u2212.\n\nBy D1 + D2 and D1 \u2264 D2 we mean the ordinary sum and order relation when D1 and\nD2 are considered as just functions. Note that D1 + D2 is not always a dimension type\nbut it is a dimension type, provided one of the summands is p-regular for all p. By 0 and\n1 we denote the dimension types which send every G \u2208 \u03c3 to 0 and 1 respectively. Recall\nthat dX = 0 if and only if dim X = 0 and\ndX\u00d7[0,1] = dX + 1.\nThe following inequality is an easy observation.\n6\n\n\fProposition 2.8 For any dimension types D1 and D2 ,\nD1 \u229e D2 \u2264 (D1\u2217 \u229e D2\u2217 )\u2217 .\nProof. Clearly, we have the equality (D1 \u229e D2 )(F ) = (D1\u2217 \u229e D2\u2217 )\u2217 (F ) for the fields. Thus,\nit suffices the check the inequality for the decorations. If D1\u2217 \u229e D2\u2217 is p\u2212 -singular, then the\nright hand part will have the decoration '+' and the inequality holds. If D1 \u229e D2 is p\u2212\nsingular, clearly the inequality holds. In the remaining case both D1 and D2 are p-regular\nand therefore, we have the equality. \u0004\n\n3\n\nExtension Theory\n\nCohomological Dimension is characterized by the following basic property: dimG X \u2264 n\nif and only for every closed A \u2282 X and a map f : A \u2212\u2192 K(G, n), f continuously extends\nover X where K(G, n) is the Eilenberg-MacLane complex of type (G, n) (we assume that\nK(G, 0) = G with discrete topology and K(G, \u221e) is a singleton). This extension characterization of Cohomological Dimension gives a rise to Extension Theory (more general\nthan Cohomological Dimension Theory) and the notion of Extension Dimension. The\nextension dimension of a space X is said to be dominated by a CW-complex K, written\ne-dimX \u2264 K, if every map f : A \u2212\u2192 K from a closed subset A of X continuously extends\nover X. Thus dimG X \u2264 n is equivalent to e-dimX \u2264 K(G, n) and dim X \u2264 n is equivalent to e-dimX \u2264 S n . For a dimension type D we denote K(D) = \u2228G\u2208\u03c3 K(G, D(G)).\nThen dX \u2264 D if and only e-dimX \u2264 K(D).\nExtension Dimension has many properties similar to Covering Dimension. For example: if e-dimX \u2264 K then e-dimA \u2264 K for every A \u2282 X and if X = \u222aFi is a countable\nunion of closed subsets of X such that e-dimFi \u2264 K for every i then e-dimX \u2264 K. Let\nus list a few more basic results of Extension Theory.\nTheorem 3.1 (Olszewski Completion Theorem [15]) Let K be a countable CWcomplex and e-dimX \u2264 K. Then there is a completion of X dominated by K.\nCorollary 3.2 For every separable metric space X there is a completion X \u2032 such that for\nall G \u2208 \u03c3,\ndimG X \u2032 = dimG X.\nWe note that for finite dimensional X this corollary follows from the theory of test\nspaces [11], [12] and the well-known fact that for every compactum C there is a completion X \u2032 of X with dim(X \u2032 \u00d7 C) = dim(X \u00d7 C) (see for example Proposition 6.2 in[5]).\nTheorem 3.3 (Dranishnikov Extension Theorem [3],[9]) Let K be a CW-complex\nand X a space. Then\n(i) dimHn (K) X \u2264 n for every n \u2265 0 if e-dimX \u2264 K;\n(ii) e-dimX \u2264 K if K is simply connected, X is finite dimensional and dimHn (K) X \u2264\nn for every n \u2265 0\n7\n\n\fWe remind that H\u2217 (K) denotes the reduced homology.\nLet K be a CW-complex. For G \u2208 \u03c3 denote nG (K) = min{n : G \u2208 \u03c3(Hn (K))} or\nnG (K) = \u221e if the set defining nG (K) is empty. If X is a compactum and e-dimX \u2264 K\nthen, by the Dranishnikov Extension Theorem and the Bockstein Theorem, we have that\ndimG X \u2264 nG (K) for every G \u2208 \u03c3.\nTheorem 3.4 (Dydak Union Theorem [9]) Let K and L be CW-complex and X =\nA \u222a B a decomposition of a space X such that e-dimA \u2264 K and e-dimB \u2264 L. Then\ne-dimX \u2264 K \u2217 L.\nWe recall that K \u2217 L = \u03a3(K \u2227 L).\nTheorem 3.5 (Dranishnikov Decomposition Theorem [4]) Let K and L be countable CW-complexes and X a compactum such that e-dimX \u2264 K \u2217 L. Then there is a\ndecomposition X = A \u222a B of X such that e-dimA \u2264 K and e-dimB \u2264 L.\nLet D1 and D2 be dimension types such that at least one of them is different from 0 and\nX = A \u222a B a decomposition of a compactum X such that dA \u2264 D1 and dB \u2264 D1 . By the\nDydak Union Theorem, dX \u2264 K(D1 ) \u2217 K(D2 ). Then dimG X \u2264 nG (K(D1 ) \u2217 K(D2 )) =\nnG (\u03a3(K(D1 ) \u2227 K(D2 ))) = nG (K(D1 ) \u2227 K(D2 )) + 1, G \u2208 \u03c3. Thus one can estimate\nthe dimension type of X by computing the numbers nG (K(D1 ) \u2227 K(D2 )), G \u2208 \u03c3. This\ncomputation was done by Dranishnikov [5]. We denote by D1 \u2295 D2 the biggest dimension\ntype such that (D1 \u2295 D2 )(G) \u2264 nG (K(D1 ) \u2227 K(D1 )), G \u2208 \u03c3 and set D1 \u2295 D2 = 0 for\nD1 = D2 = 0. The following can be easily derived from Dranishnikov's computation [5]:\nTheorem 3.6 Let D1 and D2 be dimension types. Then\nD1 \u2295 D2 = (D1\u2217 \u229e D2\u2217 )\u2217 .\nThus if X = A \u222a B is a decomposition of a compactum X with dA \u2264 D1 and dB \u2264 D2\nthen dX \u2264 D1 \u2295 D2 + 1.\nNow assume that X is a finite dimensional compactum and D1 and D2 are dimension\ntypes such that dX \u2264 D1 \u2295 D2 + 1. If D1 = D2 = 0 then dim X \u2264 1 and for a decomposition X = A \u222a B into 0-dimensional subsets we obviously have dA \u2264 D1 and\ndB \u2264 D2 . If at least one of D1 and D2 is different from 0 then K(D1 ) \u2217 K(D2 ) is simply\nconnected. Then, by the Bockstein Theorem and the Dranishnikov Extension Theorem,\ne-dimX \u2264 K(D1 ) \u2217 K(D2 ) and, by the Dranishnikov Decomposition Theorem, there is a\ndecomposition X = A \u222a B of X with e-dimA \u2264 K(D1 ) and e-dimB \u2264 K(D2 ) and, hence,\ndA \u2264 D1 and dB \u2264 D2 . Thus we can summarize\nCorollary 3.7 Let X be a compactum and D1 and D2 dimension types:\n(i) if X = A\u222aB is a decomposition with dA \u2264 D1 and dB \u2264 D2 then dX \u2264 D1 \u2295D2 +1;\n(ii) if X is finite dimensional and dX \u2264 D1 \u2295 D2 + 1 then there is a decomposition\nX = A \u222a B such that dA \u2264 D1 and dB \u2264 D2 .\n8\n\n\fNote that\n(D1 \u229e D2 )(F ) = (D1 \u2295 D2 )(F ) = D1 (F ) + D2 (F )\nfor any dimension types D1 , D2 and any field F \u2208 \u03c3.\nProposition 3.8 Let the dimension types D1 , D2 , D1\u2032 and D2\u2032 satisfy D1 \u2264 D1\u2032 and D2 \u2264\nD2\u2032 . Then D1 \u229e D2 \u2264 D1\u2032 \u229e D2\u2032 and D1 \u2295 D2 \u2264 D1\u2032 \u2295 D2\u2032\nProof. The first inequality is standard and it easy follows from the definitions. The\nsecond inequality follows from Theorem 3.6. \u0004\nIt turns out that the operation \u2295 nicely fits in the translation of some mapping theorems by Levin and Lewis [13] to the language of dimension types.\nTheorem 3.9 (Levin-Lewis [13]) Let f : X \u2212\u2192 Y be a map of compacta and let K and\nL be CW-complexes such that e-dimf \u2264 K and e-dimY \u2264 L. Then X \u00d7 [0, 1] decomposes\ninto X \u00d7 [0, 1] = A \u222a B such that e-dimA \u2264 K and e-dimB \u2264 L.\nTheorem 3.10 (Levin-Lewis [13]) Let f : X \u2212\u2192 Y be a map of compacta and, K a\ncountable CW-complexes such that e-dimf \u2264 \u03a3K and Y is finite dimensional. Then\n(i) there is a \u03c3-compact set A \u2282 X such that e-dimA \u2264 K and dim f |X\\A \u2264 0;\n(ii) there is a map g : X \u2212\u2192 [0, 1] such that for the map (f, g) : X \u2212\u2192 Y \u00d7 [0, 1] we\nhave e-dim(f, g) \u2264 K.\nLet f : X \u2212\u2192 Y be a map. For a group G we denote dimG f = sup{dimG f \u22121 (y) : y \u2208 Y }\nand for a CW-complex K we say that e-dimf \u2264 K if e-dimf \u22121 (y) \u2264 K for every y \u2208 Y .\nSimilarly, for a dimension type D we say that df \u2264 D if df \u22121 (y) \u2264 D for every y \u2208 Y .\nTheorems 3.9 and 3.10 can be translated to dimension types as follows.\nCorollary 3.11 Let f : X \u2212\u2192 Y be a map of compacta and let D1 and D2 be dimension\ntypes such that df \u2264 D1 and dY \u2264 D2 . Then dX \u2264 D1 \u2295 D2 . Moreover, if F \u2208 \u03c3 is a field\nthen dimF X \u2264 dimF f + dimF Y .\nProof. Apply Theorem 3.9 for K = K(D1 ) and L = K(D2 ) to get a decomposition\nX \u00d7 [0, 1] = A \u222a B with e-dimA \u2264 K(D1 ) and e-dimB \u2264 K(D2 ). Then dA \u2264 D1 , dB \u2264 D2\nand, by 3.7, dX + 1 = dX\u00d7[0,1] \u2264 D1 \u2295 D2 + 1 and hence dX \u2264 D1 \u2295 D2 .\nNow let F \u2208 \u03c3 be a field, n = dimF f , m = dimF Y and let K = K(F, n) and L =\nK(F, m). Then, by the reasoning we just used, there is a decomposition X \u00d7[0, 1] = A\u222aB\nsuch that e-dimA \u2264 K and e-dimB \u2264 L and, by Corollary 3.7, dX + 1 \u2264 dA \u2295 dB + 1.\nHence dimF X = dX (F ) \u2264 (dA \u2295 dB )(F ) = dA (F ) + dB (F ) = dimF A + dimF B \u2264 n + m =\ndimF f + dimF Y . \u0004\nCorollary 3.12 Let f : X \u2212\u2192 Y be a map of finite dimensional compacta and D a\ndimension type such that df \u2264 D + 1. Then\n(i) there is a \u03c3-compact set A \u2282 X such that dA \u2264 D and dim(f |X\\A ) \u2264 0;\n(ii) there is a map g : X \u2212\u2192 [0, 1] such that for the map (f, g) : X \u2212\u2192 Y \u00d7 [0, 1] we\nhave d(f,g) \u2264 D.\n9\n\n\fProof. By Corollary 3.7 we have that each fiber f \u22121 (y) decomposes into f \u22121 (y) = \u03a91 \u222a\u03a92\nwith d\u03a91 \u2264 0 and d\u03a92 \u2264 D. Then e-dim\u03a91 \u2264 S 0 , e-dim\u03a92 \u2264 K(D) and, by the Dydak\nUnion Theorem, e-dimf \u22121 (y) \u2264 S 0 \u2217 K(D) = \u03a3K(D).\nThus, e-dimf \u2264 \u03a3K(D) and the corollary follows from Theorem 3.10. \u0004\nWe end this section with the following observation.\nProposition 3.13 Let X be a finite dimensional compactum and n > 0. Then dimQ X \u2264\nn if and only if for every closed subset A of X and every map f : A \u2212\u2192 S n there is a\nmap g : S n \u2212\u2192 S n of non-zero degree such that g \u25e6 f : X \u2212\u2192 S n continuously extends\nover X.\nProof. Let M(Q, n) be a Moore space of type (Q, n). Represent M(Q, n) as the telescope\nof a sequence of maps \u03c6i : S n \u2212\u2192 S n such that deg \u03c6i = i, i > 0. Note that M(Q, 1) =\nK(Q, 1). By the Dranishnikov Extension Theorem e-dimX \u2264 M(Q, n) is equivalent to\ndimQ X \u2264 n for n \u2265 2. Thus e-dimX \u2264 M(Q, n) is equivalent to dimQ X \u2264 n for every\nn > 0.\nAssume that dimQ X \u2264 n. Consider f as a map to the first sphere of M(Q, n) and\ncontinuously extend f to f \u2032 : X \u2212\u2192 M(Q, n). Then f \u2032 (X) is contained in a finite\nsubtelescope M \u2032 of M(Q, n). Let r : M \u2032 \u2212\u2192 S n be the natural retraction to the last\nsphere of M \u2032 . Then g can be taken as r restricted to the first sphere of M \u2032 .\nNow we will show the other direction of the proposition. Take a map \u03c8 : A \u2212\u2192\nM(Q, n) from a closed subset A of X. Then \u03c8(A) is contained in a finite subtelescope of\nM(Q, n). Assume that that this subtelescope ends at the i-th sphere of M(Q, n). Then \u03c8\ncan be homotoped to a map f : A \u2212\u2192 S n to the i-th sphere of M(Q, n). Let g : S n \u2212\u2192 S n\nbe a map of degree d > 0 such that g \u25e6 f extends over X. Consider the subtelescope M \u2032\nof M(Q, n) starting at the i-th sphere and ending at the (i + d)-sphere of M(Q, n) and let\nr : M \u2032 \u2212\u2192 S n be the natural retraction of M \u2032 to the last sphere of M \u2032 . Then the degree\nof r restricted to the i-the sphere of M(Q, n) is divisible by d and hence r \u25e6 f factors up\nto homotopy through g \u25e6 f . Since r \u25e6 f and f are homotopic as maps to M \u2032 we get that\nf extends over X as a map to M \u2032 and therefore \u03c8 extends as well. \u0004\n\n4\n\nProofs of Theorems 1.3, 1.7 and 1.8\n\nA space X is called compactly represented if for every G \u2208 \u03c3 \u222a {Z} there is a compactum\nC \u2282 X such that dimG C = dimG X. We say that a space X is compactly represented\nby a subset A \u2282 X if X is compactly represented and the compacta C witnessing that\ncan be chosen to be subsets of A. Note that any \u03c3-compact set is compactly represented.\nWe say that a space X is dimensionally dominated by a space Y if dimG X \u2264 dimG Y\nfor every G \u2208 \u03c3 \u222a {Z}. It follows from the Olszewski Completion Theorem that for a\n\u03c3-compact subset A of a compactum X and a space Y there is a G\u03b4 -subset A\u2032 \u2282 X\nsuch that A \u2282 A\u2032 , A\u2032 is compactly represented by A and A\u2032 \u00d7 Y is dimensionally dominated by A \u00d7 Y . Moreover, if Y is also \u03c3-compact then we may assume that A\u2032 \u00d7 Y\n10\n\n\fis compactly represented by A \u00d7 Y . Note that dimZ X = sup{dimG X : G \u2208 \u03c3} if X is\ncompactly represented and dX\u00d7Y = dX \u229edY if X, Y and X \u00d7Y are compactly represented.\nWe say that a decomposition X = A \u222a B of a space X is a compactly represented decomposition if A, B and A \u00d7 B are compactly represented and we say that a decomposition X = A\u2032 \u222a B \u2032 is dimensionally dominated by a decomposition X = A \u222a B if\ndimG A \u2264 dimG A\u2032 , dimG B \u2264 dimG B \u2032 and dimG (A \u00d7 B) \u2264 dimG (A\u2032 \u00d7 B \u2032 ) for every\nG \u2208 \u03c3 \u222a {Z}.\nThe following proposition can be easily derived from the proof of Proposition 6.3 of [5].\nProposition 4.1 Let X be a compactum, and X = A \u222a B a decomposition. Then there is\na decomposition X = A\u2032 \u222aB \u2032 such that A\u2032 is \u03c3-compact, B \u2032 = X \\A\u2032 and the decomposition\nX = A\u2032 \u222a B \u2032 is dimensionally dominated by the decomposition X = A \u222a B.\nWe need a stronger version of Proposition 4.1.\nProposition 4.2 Let X be a compactum. For any decomposition X = A \u222a B of X\nthere is a compactly represented decomposition X = A\u2032 \u222a B \u2032 such that A\u2032 is \u03c3-compact,\nB \u2032 = X \\ A\u2032 and the decomposition X = A\u2032 \u222a B \u2032 is dimensionally dominated by the\ndecomposition X = A \u222a B.\nProof. By Proposition 4.1, we can assume that B is \u03c3-compact and A = X \\ B. Let B1\nbe a G\u03b4 -subset of X such that B \u2282 B1 , B1 is compactly represented by B and A \u00d7 B1 is\ndimensionally dominated by A \u00d7 B. Set A1 = X \\ B1 . Then there is a G\u03b4 -subset B2 of\nX such that B \u2282 B2 \u2282 B1 , B2 is compactly represented by B and A1 \u00d7 B2 is compactly\nrepresented by A1 \u00d7 B. Proceed by induction and construct for every i a G\u03b4 -set Bi and\na \u03c3-compact set Ai = X \\ Bi such that\n(i) B \u2282 Bi+1 \u2282 Bi ;\n(ii) Bi is compactly represented by B;\n(iii) Ai \u00d7 Bi+1 is compactly represented by Ai \u00d7 B.\nThen for B \u2032 = \u2229Bi and A\u2032 = \u222aAi we have that X = A\u2032 \u222a B \u2032 , A\u2032 \u2282 A B \u2282 B \u2032 , A\u2032\nis \u03c3-compact, B \u2032 is G\u03b4 , B \u2032 is compactly represented by B, A\u2032 \u00d7 B \u2032 is compactly represented by A\u2032 \u00d7 B. Recall that Ai \u00d7 B \u2032 \u2282 A \u00d7 B1 and A \u00d7 B1 is dimensionally dominated\nby A\u00d7B. Thus A\u2032 \u00d7B \u2032 is dimensionally dominated by A\u00d7B and the proposition follows. \u0004\nProof of Theorem 1.3. Let f : X \u2212\u2192 Y be an exotic map of compacta. Then for\nevery field F \u2208 \u03c3 and every y \u2208 Y we have\ndim X > dim(f \u22121 (y) \u00d7 Y ) \u2265 dimF (f \u22121 (y) \u00d7 Y ) = dimF f \u22121 (y) + dimF Y.\n\n11\n\n\fHence\ndim X > sup{dim(f \u22121 (y) \u00d7 Y )} \u2265 sup{dimF (f \u22121 (y) \u00d7 Y )} + dimF Y = dimF f + dim Y.\ny\u2208Y\n\ny\u2208Y\n\nThen, by Corollary 3.12, dimF f + dim Y \u2265 dimF X and hence\ndim X > sup{dim(f \u22121 (y) \u00d7 Y ) : y \u2208 Y } \u2265 dimF X\nfor every field F \u2208 \u03c3. Thus, by Corollary 2.7, we conclude that X is a Boltyanskii compactum and dim X = sup{dim(f \u22121 (y) \u00d7 Y ) | y \u2208 Y } + 1. \u0004\nProof of Theorem 1.7. let X = A \u222a B be an exotic decomposition of a compactum\nX. By Proposition 4.2 we may assume that X = A \u222a B is a compactly represented\ndecomposition. Then for every field F \u2208 \u03c3 we have\ndimF X \u2264 dimF A + dimF B + 1 = dimF (A \u00d7 B) + 1 \u2264 dim(A \u00d7 B) + 1 \u2264 dim X \u2212 1.\nThus dim X \u2265 dimF X + 1 for every field F \u2208 \u03c3. Then, by Corollary 2.7, X is a\nBoltyanskii compactum and there is a field F such that dimF X + 1 = dim X. Hence\ndim X = dim(A \u00d7 B) + 2 and the theorem follows. \u0004\nProof of Theorem 1.8. Let X be an n-dimensional Boltyanskii compactum with n \u2265 5.\nDefine the dimension types D1 and D2 by D1 (p) = 2\u2212 , D1 (Q) = 1 and D2 (p) = (n \u2212 4)+ ,\nD2 (Q) = n \u2212 3 for all primes p. Then\n(D1 \u2295 D2 )(p) = (2+ \u229e (n \u2212 4)\u2212 )\u2217 = ((n \u2212 2)\u2212 )\u2217 = (n \u2212 2)+\nfor all p and (D1 \u2295 D2 )(Q) = D1 (Q) + D2 (Q) = n \u2212 2. Thus, D1 \u2295 D2 = Bn\u22121 where Bn\u22121\nis the maximal Boltyanskii dimension type of dimension n \u2212 1. Since (D1 \u229e D2 )(p) =\n(n \u2212 2)\u2212 and (D1 \u229e D2 )(Q) = n \u2212 2, we obtain that (D1 \u229e D2 )(Z(p) ) = n \u2212 2 and hence,\ndim(D1 \u229e D2 ) \u2264 n \u2212 2. By Corollary 2.7, dX \u2264 Bn = Bn\u22121 + 1 = D1 \u2295 D2 + 1 and, by\nCorollary 3.7, there is a decomposition X = A \u222a B such that dA \u2264 D1 and dB \u2264 D2 . By\nProposition 4.2 we can assume that X = A\u222aB is a compactly represented decomposition.\nThen dA\u00d7B \u2264 D1 \u229e D2 and\ndim(A \u00d7 B) = dimZ (A \u00d7 B) = dim dA\u00d7B \u2264 dim(D1 \u229e D2 ) \u2264 n \u2212 2.\nThus X = A \u222a B is an exotic decomposition and the theorem follows. \u0004\nNote that for compacta X and Y with dim Y \u2265 1 we always have dim(X \u00d7Y ) \u2265 dim X +1.\nThis property immediately implies that no compactum of dimension\u2264 3 admits an exotic\nmap. Together with Proposition 4.2 this property also implies that no compactum of\ndimension\u2264 4 admits an exotic decomposition.\n12\n\n\f5\n\nProofs of Theorems 1.9 and 1.10\n\nFor n \u2265 5 and n \u2212 3 \u2265 m \u2265 2 consider the dimension types D, D1 and D2 defined by\nD(Q) = D1 (Q) = m \u2212 1, D2 (Q) = n \u2212 m \u2212 1 and for every p \u2208 P,\nD(p) = (n \u2212 1)+ ,\n\nD1 (p) = m\u2212 ,\n\nD2 (p) = (n \u2212 m \u2212 2)+ .\n\nNote that (D1 \u2295 D2 )(p) = (n \u2212 2)+ and (D1 \u229e D2 )(p) = (n \u2212 2)\u2212 . Hence, D \u2264 D1 \u2295 D2 + 1\nand dim(D1 \u229e (D2 + 1)) = n \u2212 1.\nNote that for an n-dimensional Boltyanskii compactum with n \u2265 5 and m = dimQ X +\n1 \u2264 n \u2212 3 we have dX \u2264 D. Then Theorem 1.10 immediately follows from the following\nproposition.\nProposition 5.1 Every n-dimensional compactum X with dX \u2264 D admits a map f :\nX \u2212\u2192 Y to an m-dimensional compactum Y such that dY \u2264 D1 and df \u2264 D2 + 1. Thus\nfor every y \u2208 Y ,\ndim(f \u22121 (y) \u00d7 Y ) \u2264 dim(D1 \u229e (D2 + 1)) = n \u2212 1\nand hence f is an exotic map.\nAll the cases of Theorem 1.9, except n = 4, are covered by Theorem 1.10 for m = 2. Let\nus show that the missing case n = 4 also follows from Proposition 5.1.\nProof of Theorem 1.9 (the missing case). Consider the map f : X \u2212\u2192 Y constructed in Proposition 5.1 for n = 5 and m = 2. By Theorem 3.12, there is a map\ng : X \u2212\u2192 [0, 1] such that the map (f, g) : X \u2212\u2192 Y \u00d7[0, 1] is of dimension type d(f,g) \u2264 D2 .\nBy the Hurewicz Theorem there is t \u2208 [0, 1] such that X \u2032 = g \u22121 (t) is of dim \u2265 4. Let\nf \u2032 : X \u2032 \u2212\u2192 Y be the map (f, g)|X \u2032 followed by the projection from Y \u00d7 [0, 1] to [0, 1] and\nlet Y \u2032 = f \u2032 (X \u2032 ). Then df \u2032 \u2264 D2 and dY \u2032 \u2264 D1 . Thus dim f \u2032 \u2264 2 and dim Y \u2032 \u2264 2 and since\ndim X \u2032 \u2265 4 we get, by the Hurewicz Theorem, that dim X \u2032 = 4 and dim f \u2032 = dim Y \u2032 = 2.\nNote that dim(D1 \u229e D2 ) = 3 and hence f \u2032 : X \u2032 \u2212\u2192 Y \u2032 is an exotic map we are looking\nfor. \u0004\nIn the proof of Proposition 5.1 we will use the following.\nProposition 5.2 Let X be a compactum, M an m-dimensional manifold possibly with\nboundary, A a \u03c3-compact subset of X with dim A \u2264 m, F a closed subset of X and\nf : X \u2212\u2192 M a map which is 0-dimensional on A \u2229 F . Then f can be arbitrarily closely\napproximated by a map f \u2032 : X \u2212\u2192 M such that f \u2032 is 0-dimensional on A and f \u2032 coincides\nwith f on F .\nProof. This a typical application of the Baire Category Theorem. The following fact is\nwell known:\n(1) For every m-dimensional compactum A the set G of 0-dimensional maps f : A \u2192\nm\nR is dense G\u03b4 in the space of all continuous maps C(A, Rm ) given the uniform convergence topology.\n13\n\n\fFor the proof we present G as the intersection of sets Wn of maps f : A \u2192 Rm such\nthat diam C < 1/n for all components C of the preimage f \u22121 (x) for all x. It is easy\nto see that each Wn is open. One way to show that Wn is dense is first to approximate\na given map f : A \u2192 Rm by a composition f \u2032 \u25e6 q where q : A \u2192 K m is an (1/n)-map\nto an m-dimensional simplicial complex and then to approximate f \u2032 by a 0-dimensional\nmap g : K m \u2192 Rm . The latter can be obtained by a proper perturbation of all vertices\nof sufficiently small subdivision of K m in Rm and by taking the corresponding piece-wise\nlinear map g.\nWe note that Rm can be replaced by the half space Rm\n+ in this proof.\nThe above statement can be generalized to the following:\n(2) For every compact metric pair (X, A) with m-dimensional A the set G of maps\nf : (X, A) \u2192 (M, B) with 0-dimensional restriction f |A is dense G\u03b4 in the space of all\ncontinuous maps of pairs C((X, A), (M, B)) where M is compactum and B \u2282 M is an\nopen set homeomorphic to Rm or to Rm\n+.\nNote that C((X, A), (M, B)) is open in C(X, A) and hence is complete. Then the\nabove argument works for this statement as well.\nAs a corollary we obtain the following:\n(3) For every compact metric pair (X, A) with m-dimensional A and an m-dimensional\nmanifold with boundary M every continuous map f : X \u2192 M can be approximated by\nmaps 0-dimensional on A.\nTo derive it from the above we consider a finite cover B1 , . . . Bk of f (A) by open sets\nhomeomorphic to Rm or Rm\n+ and a partition A = A1 \u222a . . . \u222a Ak into closed subsets such\nthat f (Ai ) \u2282 Bi . Let\nW = W ({Ai }, {Bi }) = {g : X \u2192 M | g(Ai ) \u2282 Bi , i = 1, . . . , k}\nbe a corresponding neighborhood of f in the compact-open topology. Then the set W \u2229\n(\u2229i Gi ) is dense G\u03b4 in W where Gi the set of maps g : (X, Ai ) \u2192 (M, Bi ) which are\n0-dimensional on Ai .\nWe note that the compactness of A in this statement can be replaced by \u03c3-compactness.\nFinally, to obtain the statement of the proposition we consider a compact subset\nF \u2282 X with a fixed map f0 : F \u2192 M which is 0-dimensional on F \u2229 A. Let A\u2032 = A \\ F .\nNote that A\u2032 = \u222aAi is the countable union of compact sets Ai . Now we prove the statement (3) for A\u2032 in the complete metric space C(X, M; F, f0 ) = {f : X \u2192 M | f |F = f0 }\nusing the same proof. By the countable union theorem any map f \u2208 C(X, M; F, f0 ) which\nis 0-dimensional on A\u2032 is also 0-dimensional on A. \u0004\n\nProof of Proposition 5.1. Since D \u2264 D1 \u2295 D2 + 1, by Corollary 3.7 there is a decomposition X = A \u222a B such that dA \u2264 D1 and dB \u2264 D2 . By the corollary of Olszewski\nCompletion Theorem we may assume that B is G\u03b4 . Thus replacing A by X \\ B we assume\nthat A is \u03c3-compact. Represent A = \u222aAi as a countable union compact subsets A \u2282 X\n14\n\n\fsuch that Ai \u2282 Ai+1 , i = 1, 2, . . .. Note that dim A \u2264 dim D1 = m.\nWe will construct for each i an m-dimensional simplicial complex Yi , a bonding map\n\u03c9ii+1 : Yi+1 \u2212\u2192 Yi and a map \u03c6i : X \u2212\u2192 Yi . We fix metrics in X and in each Yi and with\nrespect to these metrics we determine 0 < \u01ebi < 1/2i such that the following properties\nwill be satisfied:\n(i) \u03c6i is 0-dimensional on A and for every open set U \u2282 Yi with diamU < 2\u01ebi the set\n\u2229 Ai splits into disjoint sets open in Ai and of diam \u2264 1/i;\nj\n(ii) dist(\u03c9ji+1 \u25e6 \u03c6i+1 , \u03c9ji \u25e6 \u03c6i ) < \u01ebj /2i for i \u2265 j where \u03c9ij = \u03c9j\u22121\n\u25e6 . . . \u25e6 \u03c9ii+1 : Yj \u2212\u2192 Yi\nfor j > i and \u03c9ii = id : Yi \u2212\u2192 Yi .\n\n\u03c6\u22121\ni (U)\n\nThe construction will be carried out so that for Y = invlim(Yi , \u03c9ii+1 ) we have dimQ Y \u2264\nm \u2212 1. Let us first show that the proposition follows from this construction. Denote\nfi = limj\u2192\u221e \u03c9ij \u25e6 \u03c6j : X \u2212\u2192 Yi . From (ii) it follows that fi is well-defined, continuous and\ndist(fi , \u03c6i ) \u2264 \u01ebi . From the definition of fi it follows that fj \u25e6 fij = fi . Hence the maps fi\ndefine the corresponding map f : X \u2212\u2192 Y such that \u03c9i \u25e6 f = fi where \u03c9i : Y \u2212\u2192 Yi is\nthe projection. Then it follows from (i) that for every y \u2208 Yi the set fi\u22121 (y) \u2229 Ai splits\ninto finitely many disjoint sets closed in Ai and of diam \u2264 1/i. This implies that for every\ny \u2208 Y we have that dim(f \u22121 (y)\u2229Ai ) \u2264 0 and hence dim(f \u22121 (y)\u2229A) \u2264 0. Then, by Corollary 3.7, df \u2264 D2 +1. Since dim Yi \u2264 m we have dim Y \u2264 m and since dim D2 +1 = n\u2212m,\nHurewicz Theorem implies that dim Y = m. The condition dimQ Y \u2264 m \u2212 1 and the formula for the cohomological dimension with respect to Z(p) imply that dimZp\u221e Y \u2264 m \u2212 1\nfor both p-regular and p-singular cases. Therefore, dY \u2264 D1 . Thus, for every y \u2208 Y we\nhave\ndim(f \u22121 (y) \u00d7 Y ) \u2264 dim(D1 \u229e (D2 + 1)) = n \u2212 1\nand hence f is an exotic map.\nNow we return to our construction. Let Y1 be an m-simplex and let \u03c61 : X \u2212\u2192 Y\nbe any map which is 0-dimensional on A. Then one can choose 0 < \u01eb1 < 1/2 so that (i)\nholds for i = 1. Assume that the construction is completed for i and proceed to i + 1\nas follows. Take a triangulation of Yi so fine that for every simplex \u2206 of Yi we have\nthat diam(\u03c9ji (\u2206)) < \u01ebj /2i for every j such that i \u2265 j \u2265 1. For each m-simplex \u2206 of Yi\nconsider a small ball D centered at the barycenter of \u2206 and not touching \u2202D. Recall that\ndimQ X = m \u2212 1. Then, by Proposition 3.13, for \u03c6i |... : \u03c6\u22121\ni (\u2202D) \u2212\u2192 \u2202D there is a map\n\u03c8\u2202D : \u2202D \u2212\u2192 \u2202D of non-zero degree such that \u03c8\u2202D \u25e6 \u03c6i |... extends over \u03c6\u22121\ni (D) to a map\n\u03c6D : \u03c6\u22121\n(D)\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2202D.\nClearly\nwe\ncan\nassume\nthat\n\u03c8\nis\n0-dimensional\n(even finite-to\u2202D\ni\none). Denote by \u1ef8i+1 the quotient space of Yi obtained by removing for each m-simplex\n\u2206 of Yi the interior IntD of the ball D and identifying the points of \u2202D according to the\nmap \u03c8\u2202D . We consider \u2202\u2206 also as a subset of \u1ef8i+1 and we denote by Y\u2206 the subspace of\n\u1ef8i+1 obtained from \u2206. Let \u03c9\u0303ii+1 : \u1ef8i+1 \u2212\u2192 Yi be any map such that \u03c9\u0303ii+1 is 1-to-1 over\nthe (m \u2212 1)-skeleton of Yi and \u03c9\u0303ii+1 sends Y\u2206 to \u2206 for every m-simplex \u2206 of Yi . The\n15\n\n\fmap \u03c6i and the maps \u03c6D naturally define the corresponding map \u03c6\u0303i+1 : X \u2212\u2192 \u1ef8i+1 which\ncoincides with \u03c6i on \u03c6\u22121\ni (\u2202\u2206) for every m-simplex \u2206 of Yi . Note that \u03c6\u0303i+1 is 0-dimensional\non A \u2229 \u03c6\u22121\n(\u2206\n\\\nIntD)\nfor every m-simplex \u2206 in Yi . Let a space Yi+1 \u2283 \u1ef8i+1 be obtained\ni\nfrom \u1ef8i+1 by attaching for every sphere \u03c8\u2202D (\u2202D) \u2282 \u1ef8i+1 the manifold \u03c8\u2202D (\u2202D) \u00d7 [0, 1]\nby identifying \u03c8\u2202D (\u2202D) \u00d7 0 with \u03c8\u2202D (\u2202D) and let \u03c0i+1 : Yi+1 \u2212\u2192 \u1ef8i+1 be a retraction\nprojecting each manifold \u03c8\u2202D (\u2202D) \u00d7 [0, 1] to \u03c8\u2202D (\u2202D). Then, by Proposition 5.2, for\n\u22121\nevery m-simplex \u2206 of Yi we can extend \u03c6\u0303i+1 restricted to \u03c6\u22121\ni (\u2206 \\ IntD) over \u03c6i (\u2206) to a\nmap being 0-dimensional on A\u2229\u03c6\u22121\ni (\u2206) and this way we define the map \u03c6i+1 : X \u2212\u2192 Yi+1\nwhich is 0-dimensional on A. Then there is 0 < \u01ebi+1 < 1/2i+1 such that (i) holds for i + 1.\nDefine \u03c9ii+1 = \u03c9\u0303ii+1 \u25e6 \u03c0i : Yi+1 \u2212\u2192 Yi and note that (ii) is satisfied. Clearly we may assume\nthat Yi+1 admits a triangulation and the construction is completed.\nNote that for every m-simplex \u2206 in Yi we have that\nH m ((\u03c9ii+1 )\u22121 (\u2206), (\u03c9ii+1)\u22121 (\u2202\u2206); Q) =\nH m ((\u03c9\u0303ii+1 )\u22121 (\u2206), (\u03c9\u0303ii+1)\u22121 (\u2202\u2206); Q) = H m (Y\u2206 , \u2202\u2206; Q) = 0.\nThis implies that for every subcomplex Zi of Yi we have that\nH m (Yi+1, (\u03c9ii+1 )\u22121 (Zi ); Q) = 0.\nRecall that diam\u03c9ji (\u2206) < \u01ebj /2i < 1/2j+i for every i \u2265 j \u2265 1 and every simplex \u2206 of Yi .\nThen H m (Y, Z; Q) = 0 for every closed subset Z of Y and hence dimQ Y \u2264 m \u2212 1.
