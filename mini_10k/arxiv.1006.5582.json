However for incomplete hyperbolic metrics, the situation is more complicated, and in this setting, it is natural to\nlook at the metric completion of the manifold. For simplicity, we will consider the case of a hyperbolic metric g on a 3-manifold M which is the interior\nof a compact manifold with boundary M\u0304 . Then there are, broadly speaking,\ntwo distinct types of situations depending on whether or not g extends to a\nmetric on the boundary. In the latter, the metric degenerates on \u2202 M\u0304 : this\n\u2217\n\nUniv Paris-Sud, Laboratoire de Math\u00e9matiques, UMR8628, Orsay, F-91405; CNRS,\nOrsay, F 91405.

Partially\nsupported by the DFG Schwerpunktprogramm 1154 \"Globale Differentialgeometrie\"\n\n1\n\n\fcan happen in any number of ways, but cone-manifolds provide arguably\nthe simplest and most interesting class of examples. In this setting, the\nboundary \u2202 M\u0304 collapses to a (possibly disconnected) geodesic graph, called\nthe singular locus \u03a3, along which the metric exhibits a simple, \"cone-like\"\nsingularity. The completion of M is then a length space X, without boundary, such that X \\ \u03a3 = (M, g); for more details and precise definitions, see\n[BLP, CHK, MM2, Thu2]. Cone-manifolds are particularly interesting to\nstudy, since they arise naturally in many different contexts: they first appeared as deformations of complete, cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds [Thu1];\nthey are the natural models for orbifolds, and the theory of their deformations plays a prominent role in the proof of the orbifold version of the\ngeometrization theorem [BLP, CHK]; as doubles of polyhedra, they form a\nnatural framework for the resolution of Stoker's problem [MM2, Sto]; finally,\nlet us mention their use as models for space-times with massive point-like\nparticles [KS].\nThroughout this article, X will denote a closed, orientable hyperbolic\ncone-3-manifold, and \u03a3 its singular locus. The homeomorphism type of the\npair (X, \u03a3) is called the topological type of the cone-manifold. The smooth\nor regular part of X is the (incomplete) hyperbolic manifold M = X \\ \u03a3. To\neach edge ei of the singular locus, one can assign a quantity called its cone\nangle: it is defined as the positive real number \u03b1i such that in cylindrical\ncoordinates, the metric near any point of the interior of ei is expressed as\ng = dr2 + sinh2 (r) d\u03b82 + cosh2 (r) dz 2 ,\n\nr \u2208 (0, \u000f), \u03b8 \u2208 R/\u03b1i Z, z \u2208 (\u2212\u000f, \u000f).\n\nIf all cone angles are less than 2\u03c0, then X is a metric space with curvature\nbounded below by \u22121 in the triangle comparison sense. Furthermore, if all\ncone angles are less than or equal to \u03c0, then the vertices of \u03a3 are at most\ntrivalent, which simplifies significantly the deformation theory. In general,\nthe valence of the singular vertices can be arbitrarily high.\nWe are interested in the space of hyperbolic cone-manifold structures in\nthe case where the cone angles are less than 2\u03c0, i.e. contained in the interval\n(0, 2\u03c0). More precisely, let C\u22121 (X, \u03a3) denote the space of hyperbolic conemanifold structures on X of fixed topological type (X, \u03a3); it is topologized\nas a subspace of the deformation space Def(M ) of incomplete hyperbolic\nstructures on M . Let N be the number of edges in \u03a3. In their seminal\narticle [HK], C.D. Hodgson and S.P. Kerckhoff showed that if the singular\nlocus is a link, i.e. it does not contain vertices, then the map\n\u03b1 = (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1N ) : C\u22121 (X, \u03a3) \u2192 (0, 2\u03c0)N\nsending a hyperbolic cone-manifold structure to the vector of its cone angles\nis a local homeomorphism at the given structure. Hodgson and Kerckhoff\nproved more generally that Def(M ) is locally a smooth manifold at the given\n2\n\n\fstructure and that dimR Def(M ) = 2N ; cone-manifold structures are then\nidentified to lie on a half-dimensional submanifold. In [Wei2], the second\nauthor showed that the same is true when vertices are allowed, if the cone\nangles are less than or equal to \u03c0. The general case has been open until\nrecently, when the following has been proven independently in [Mon] and in\n[Wei4]:\nTheorem 1.1. Let X be a hyperbolic cone-3-manifold with cone angles less\nthan 2\u03c0. Then the map\n\u03b1 = (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1N ) : C\u22121 (X, \u03a3) \u2192 (0, 2\u03c0)N\nis a local homeomorphism at the given structure.\nA similar result applies in the spherical and the Euclidean cases, at least\nwhen the cone angles are less than or equal to \u03c0, cf. [PW, Wei2]. However,\nif the cone angle bound is 2\u03c0, then there exist counter-examples in the\nspherical case [Por, Sch], whereas a weaker infinitesimal rigidity result still\nholds in the Euclidean case [MM2].\nThe techniques used to show Theorem 1.1 in [Mon] and [Wei4] are somewhat different: in the former, the starting point is an infinitesimal rigidity\ntheorem for Einstein deformations obtained by the first author in a joint\nwork with R. Mazzeo, cf. [MM2], while the latter proceeds along the lines\nof [HK, Wei2]. There the main technical ingredient is a vanishing theorem for L2 -cohomology with values in a certain flat bundle, see section 2.3.\nCommon to both approaches is the use of the variety of representations\n\u03c1 : \u03c01 M \u2192 SL2 (C) to pass from an infinitesimal rigidity statement to a\nlocal deformation theorem. Indeed, we recall that the map that sends a\nhyperbolic structure to its holonomy representation hol : \u03c01 M \u2192 SL2 (C)\ninduces a local homeomorphism\n(1.1)\n\n[hol] : Def(M ) \u2192 X(\u03c01 M, SL2 (C))\n\nwhere the right-hand side is the space of representations \u03c1 : \u03c01 M \u2192 SL2 (C)\nconsidered up to conjugation by elements in SL2 (C), see for instance [Gol3].\nIn the above-mentioned works it has become apparent that the dimension\nof Def(M ) is much larger once vertices of P\nhigher valence are present, more\nprecisely one has dimR Def(M ) = 2N + kj=1 2(mj \u2212 3), where k is the\nnumber of singular vertices and mj the valence of the vertex vj \u2208 \u03a3. This\ncorresponds to the fact that the spherical cone-surface structure on the link\nof such a vertex becomes more flexible. More precisely, as a consequence of\n[LT, Tro], see also [MW], one has that for m \u2265 3 the space of spherical conemanifold structures on (S2 , {p1 , . . . , pm }) is locally parametrized by T0,m \u00d7\n(0, 2\u03c0)m , where T0,m is the Teichm\u00fcller space of the m-times punctured\nsphere. Note that the dimension of T0,m is precisely 2(m \u2212 3).\n3\n\n\fThe aim of this article is to describe how this additional flexibility can\nbe used to deform a given cone-manifold structure on X into cone-manifold\nstructures on X of possibly different topological type, i.e. with possibly\nthe pair (X, \u03a30 ) not being homeomorphic to the pair (X, \u03a3). This will be\nachieved by splitting a vertex vj of valence mj \u2265 4 into two or more vertices of lower valence. Note that what we actually deform is the incomplete\nhyperbolic metric on the smooth part M ; the new cone-manifold is its completion. Before describing our main result, we need to set up some more\nnotations.\nFor simplicity we will assume that \u03a3 does not contain circle components.\nThis makes for a cleaner statement of our main results and, besides that, the\ncase of circle components is already well understood by the work of Hodgson\nand Kerckhoff. For \u03b5 > 0 sufficiently small the subset M\u0304\u03b5 = M \\ U\u03b5 (\u03a3)\nis a compact core of M , i.e. M\u0304\u03b5 ,\u2192 M is a homotopy equivalence. Its\nboundary\n\u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 is a (possibly disconnected) surface of genus g, such that\nPk\nj=1 (mj \u2212 3) + N = 3g \u2212 3 (recall that N and k denote respectively the\nnumber of edges and of vertices contained in the singular locus \u03a3, and that\nfor each vertex vj , mj denotes the number of edges meeting in vj ). Let Lj\nbe the link of the vertex vj ; it is a spherical cone-surface, homeomorphic to\nthe 2-sphere when the cone angles are less than 2\u03c0. Its smooth part is an\nmj -times punctured sphere, denoted by Nj , which embeds naturally (but\nnot isometrically) as an open subsurface of \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 ; throughout this article Nj\nand the image of this embedding will be identified.\nA pair-of-pants decomposition Cj = {\u03bdj,1 , . . . , \u03bdj,mj \u22123 } of Nj determines\nan unknotted embedding of a trivalent tree \u03a30j into the closed 3-ball B\u03b5 (vj )\nin such a way that the curves \u03bdj,i are precisely the meridian curves of the\nnewly created edges e0j,i and that \u03a3 \u2229 B\u03b5 (vj ) is obtained back by collapsing\nthese new edges. (An embedding of a trivalent tree (T, \u2202T ) ,\u2192 (D3 , \u2202D3 )\nis unknotted, if it factors through an embedding of the 2-disk (D2 , \u2202D2 ) ,\u2192\n(D3 , \u2202D3 ).) If we now replace \u03a3 \u2229 B\u03b5 (vj ) by \u03a30j , then we say that (X, \u03a30 )\nis obtained from (X, \u03a3) by splitting a vertex, see Fig. 1 for examples. The\nhomeomorphism type of the pair (X, \u03a30 ) is determined by the pair-of-pants\ndecomposition Cj , where homotopic pair-of-pants decompositions clearly\nyield the same type.\nIn order to construct a hyperbolic cone-manifold structure on the pair\n(X, \u03a30 ), even locally on a neighbourhood of the new singular locus \u03a30 , we\nneed an additional, geometric condition on the splitting curve \u03bdj,i , namely\nthat it satisfies the so-called splitting condition, cf. Definition 3.1. We will\nalso simply say that such a curve is splittable. The splitting condition allows\nus to construct a concrete model for the splitting deformation along \u03bdj,i ;\nthis construction is carried out in section 3.2. The geometry of a splitting\ndeformation will in general be different for two splittable curves in the same\nhomotopy class of a simple closed curve. However, there is a notion of\n\n4\n\n\fFigure 1: Different ways of splitting a vertex\nequivalence of splittable curves in a homotopy class, which is essentially\nrequiring the curves to be homotopic through splittable curves, cf. section\n3.1. Equivalent splittable curves then turn out to yield the same geometric\nsplitting deformations.\nLet now \u03bc\n~ = {\u03bc1 , . . . , \u03bcN } be the set of meridians of \u03a3, and let further\nCj be a pair-of-pants decomposition of Nj for each j = 1, . . . , k. Note that\nwe fix a system of simple closed curves here and not just their homotopy\nS\nclasses. Let ~\u03bd = {\u03bd1 , . . . , \u03bd3g\u22123\u2212N } denote the family of curves kj=1 Cj ,\n`\nwhich is a pair-of-pants decomposition of kj=1 Nj ; and let C be equal to\n\u03bc\n~ \u222a ~\u03bd , which is (up to homotopy) a pair-of-pants decomposition of \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 . Let\nus assume for simplicity now that all the curves in ~\u03bd satisfy the splitting\ncondition. We will then say that a deformation of the hyperbolic conemanifold structure on X is compatible with ~\u03bd , if its singular locus \u03a30 is\nobtained by splitting some vertices vj as determined by Cj and the geometric\ndeformation on a neighbourhood of the singular locus is precisely given by\na model deformation as in Definition 3.11. Here we allow that some of the\nnewly created edges have length 0. These model deformations combine the\nsplitting deformations along the curves in ~\u03bd with the usual deformations\nof the singular tube, namely changing the spherical structure on the links\n(which involves changing the cone-angles) and changing the length or twist\n\n5\n\n\fparameters of the singular edges. Let C\u22121 (X, ~\u03bd ) denote the space of ~\u03bd compatible hyperbolic cone-manifold structures on X, cf. Definition 4.1; it\nis topologized as a subset of Def(M ). Clearly C\u22121 (X, \u03a3) \u2282 C\u22121 (X, ~\u03bd ) for\nany such family ~\u03bd .\nTo a cone-manifold structure on X compatible with ~\u03bd , we can associate\nthe vector of the cone angles \u03b1 = (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1N ) corresponding to the original\nedges (e1 , . . . , eN ) and the vector of the lengths ` = (`1 , . . . , `3g\u22123\u2212N ) =\n(lj,i )j=1,...,k, i=1,...,mj of the newly created edges. Our main result is that\nthese data actually provide a parametrization of the space C\u22121 (X, ~\u03bd ) near\nX, under the following two assumptions. The first one is that the curves in\n~\u03bd satisfy the splitting condition as introduced above. The second one is that\nC is admissible in the sense of Definition 2.3; this is essentially an algebraic\nassumption which ensures that the holonomy representation restricted to\nany pair-of-pants in a decomposition of a link remains irreducible.\nTheorem 1.2. Let X be a hyperbolic cone-3-manifold with cone angles less\nthan\n~ . Let ~\u03bd be a pair-of-pants decomposition of\n`k 2\u03c0 and meridian set \u03bc\nN\nsuch\nthat\nC\n=\n\u03bc\n~\n\u222a\n~\u03bd gives an admissible pair-of-pants decompoj\nj=1\nsition of \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 . If all the curves in ~\u03bd are splittable, then the map\n3g\u22123\u2212N\n(\u03b1, `) : C\u22121 (X, ~\u03bd ) \u2192 (0, 2\u03c0)N \u00d7 R\u22650\n\nsending a ~\u03bd -compatible cone-manifold structure to the vector composed of its\noriginal edges' cone angles and new edges' lengths, is a local homeomorphism\nat the given structure.\nNote that we recover Theorem 1.1 by setting `i = 0 for all i (if there exists\na family ~\u03bd satisfying the above assumptions).\nThe main difficulty in the proof of Theorem 1.2 is to obtain an adapted\nlocal chart on Def(M ), or equivalently (using (1.1)) on X(\u03c01 M, SL2 (C)).\nAs in the previous works, the strategy consists of constructing first a larger,\nadequate coordinate system on the simpler space X(\u03c01 \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 , SL2 (C)). Using\nthe infinitesimal rigidity, we can then show that part of these coordinates lift\nvia the natural map X(\u03c01 M, SL2 (C)) \u2192 X(\u03c01 \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 , SL2 (C)) to a local chart\non the former space. This is what is done in section 2. The coordinate system\nis provided by action-angle variables: as explained in subsection 2.1 and 2.2,\nthe character variety X(\u03c01 \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 , SL2 (C)) has a canonical complex-symplectic\nstructure (actually introduced by Goldman [Gol5], along the lines of [AB,\nGol1]), and the traces of the curves in C yield a holomorphic completely\nintegrable system whenever C is admissible. The L2 -cohomology vanishing\nresult of [Wei4] is then applied in subsection 2.3 to show which part of the\naction-angle coordinates lifts well to Def(M ) near X (Theorem 2.11).\nTo construct actual deformations of the cone-manifold X, we follow the\nsame strategy of beginning with a simpler problem, namely deforming a\nneighbourhood of the singular locus. The splitting condition, explained in\n6\n\n\fsubsection 3.1, ensures the existence of splitting deformations as constructed\nin subsection 3.2. We survey the other, more standard deformations of\nthe singular tube U\u03b5 (\u03a3) in subsection 3.3, and give in Proposition 3.10 the\nrelation between the ~\u03bd -compatible deformations of U\u03b5 (\u03a3) and the actionangle coordinates on X(\u03c01 \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 , SL2 (C)).\nCombining the results of sections 2 and 3, we can characterize the holonomy representations of the elements of C\u22121 (X, ~\u03bd ). This enables us to determine which ~\u03bd -compatible deformations of U\u03b5 (\u03a3) can be extended to the\nwhole of the cone-manifold, leading to the following statement:\nTheorem 4.3. Let X be a hyperbolic cone-3-manifold with meridian set \u03bc\n~\nand`\ncone angles \u03b1 = (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1N ) \u2208 (0, 2\u03c0)N . Let ~\u03bd be a family of curves\non kj=1 Nj such that C = \u03bc\n~ \u222a ~\u03bd is up to homotopy an admissible pairof-pants decomposition of \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 . Then the ~\u03bd -compatible deformation of the\nhyperbolic cone-manifold structure on X corresponding to a vector (\u03b10 , `) \u2208\n(0, 2\u03c0)N \u00d7 R3g\u22123\u2212N\nclose to (\u03b1, 0) exists, if the curves \u03bdi with `i > 0 are\n\u22650\nsplittable and disjoint.\nTheorem 1.2 is then a direct consequence. In the remaining part of\nsection 4, we discuss the stratified structure of the space of cone-manifold\n`\ndeformations of X and its relation with the curve complex of Nj , and we\nexplain how our main result applies to the polyhedral case.\nAcknowledgments: The second author would like to thank Bill Goldman\nfor helpful conversations about surface group representations and the hospitality during the visit at University of Maryland.\n\n2\n\nLocal coordinates on the variety of characters\n\nWe begin by recalling various facts about the variety of representations of\na surface group into the Lie group SL2 (C). Let S be a closed orientable\nsurface of genus g \u2265 2 in the following. Let R(\u03c01 S, SL2 (C)) be the space\nof group homomorphisms \u03c1 : \u03c01 S \u2192 SL2 (C) equipped with the compactopen topology. The group SL2 (C) acts on the space R(\u03c01 S, SL2 (C)) by\nconjugation and we may form the set-theoretic quotient\nX(\u03c01 S, SL2 (C)) = R(\u03c01 S, SL2 (C))/ SL2 (C).\nWe will endow X(\u03c01 S, SL2 (C)) with the quotient topology and we will refer\nto the elements of X(\u03c01 S, SL2 (C)) as characters. In our main application S\nwill be the boundary of a compact core of the smooth part of a hyperbolic\ncone-3-manifold, i.e. S = \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 . Note that here S may be disconnected,\nin which case we have to replace X(\u03c01 S, SL2 (C)) by the product of the\ncharacter varieties of the fundamental groups of the connected components\nof S, as for example explained in [Mon] and [Wei3]. Since this presents\n7\n\n\fno further technical difficulty, we will mostly pretend that S is actually\nconnected.\nRecall that a representation \u03c1 : \u03c01 S \u2192 SL2 (C) is called irreducible if it\ndoes not leave invariant any line in C2 . Let Rirr (\u03c01 S, SL2 (C)) be the space\nof irreducible representations and Xirr (\u03c01 S, SL2 (C)) the space of irreducible\ncharacters. It is known that Rirr (\u03c01 S, SL2 (C)) is a complex manifold of complex dimension 6g \u2212 3, cf. [Gol1, Gol5]. Furthermore PSL2 (C) acts properly\nand freely on Rirr (\u03c01 S, SL2 (C)), hence Xirr (\u03c01 S, SL2 (C)) is a complex manifold of complex dimension 6g \u2212 6, see [Gol5] and the references therein for\ndetails.\n\n2.1\n\nThe complex symplectic structure and complex twist\nflows\n\nIn the following we review Goldman's construction of a natural complexsymplectic structure on Xirr (\u03c01 S, SL2 (C)) as carried out in [Gol1, Gol5].\nRecall that a complex-symplectic manifold Y is a complex manifold equipped\nwith a non-degenerate closed holomorphic 2-form \u03a9. If 2n is the complex\ndimension of Y , then non-degeneracy of \u03a9 may be rephrased by saying that\n\u03a9n is a non-vanishing (2n, 0)-form. Let\nb : sl2 (C) \u00d7 sl2 (C) \u2192 C\nbe a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form which is Ad-invariant. Such a\npairing is provided by the trace form on sl2 (C), i.e. b(A, B) = tr(AB) for\nA, B \u2208 sl2 (C). Let\nE\u03c1 = S\u0303 \u00d7Ad \u25e6\u03c1 sl2 (C)\nbe the flat vector bundle on S with fiber sl2 (C) and holonomy given by the\nrepresentation Ad \u25e6\u03c1. Then, by Ad-invariance, b induces a pairing\nbE\u03c1 : E\u03c1 \u00d7 E\u03c1 \u2192 C\nwhich is parallel and fiberwise non-degenerate. Finally, by Poincar\u00e9-duality,\nthe pairing\n\u03a9 : H 1 (S; E\u03c1 ) \u00d7 H 1 (S; E\u03c1 ) \u2192 C\nZ\n([\u03b1], [\u03b2]) 7\u2192\nbE\u03c1 (\u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2)\nS\n\nis skew-symmetric and non-degenerate. Now recall that, using Weil's construction, the tangent space of Xirr (\u03c01 S, SL2 (C)) at a character [\u03c1] may\nbe identified with the cohomology group H 1 (\u03c01 S; sl2 (C)Ad \u25e6\u03c1 ), which in\nturn may be identified with H 1 (S; E\u03c1 ) using de Rham's theorem. With\nthese identifications, \u03a9 becomes a 2-form, shown to be indeed closed and\nholomorphic in [Gol1]. Hence it defines a complex-symplectic structure on\nXirr (\u03c01 S, SL2 (C)), which is actually \u03c01 S-invariant.\n8\n\n\fWe continue with the description of the complex Hamiltonian flows associated to the trace functions; the material we present here is in essence\ncontained in [Gol2], see also [Gol5]. If (Y, \u03a9) is a complex-symplectic manifold and f : Y \u2192 C is holomorphic, then the complex Hamiltonian vector\nfield Xf is defined by\n\u03a9(Xf , * ) = df.\nBy definition, Xf is a holomorphic vector field on Y , and hence possesses a\nlocal holomorphic flow \u03c6f , the complex Hamiltonian flow associated with f .\nThe trajectory through y \u2208 Y is the holomorphic curve z 7\u2192 \u03c6fz (y) satisfying\nthe ODE\n\u2202 f\n\u03c6 (y) = Xf (\u03c6fz (y))\n\u2202z z\nin \"complex time\" z \u2208 C (for |z| sufficiently small). For holomorphic functions f, g : Y \u2192 C the Poisson bracket is as usual defined by\n{f, g} = \u03a9(Xf , Xg )\nand we say that f and g Poisson-commute if {f, g} = 0.\nLet now Y = Xirr (\u03c01 S, SL2 (C)). For any closed curve \u03b3 on S, we define\nthe function\ntr\u03b3 : X(\u03c01 S, SL2 (C)) \u2192 C\n\u03c7 = [\u03c1] 7\u2192 tr \u03c1(\u03b30 )\nwhere \u03b30 \u2208 \u03c01 S is freely homotopic to \u03b3; note that it does not depend on its\norientation. In the case \u03b3 is a simple closed curve, the associated complex\nHamiltonian vector field X\u03b3 can be described as follows.\nFor A \u2208 SL2 (C) we may consider the differential of the trace at A as a\nmap (d tr)A : sl2 (C) \u2192 C by setting\n(d tr)A (B) =\n\nd\ndt t=0 tr(A exp(tB))\n\nfor B \u2208 sl2 (C). If b : sl2 (C) \u00d7 sl2 (C) \u2192 C is a non-degenerate bilinear form,\nthe variation function F : SL2 (C) \u2192 sl2 (C) with respect to b is defined by\nrequiring that\n(d tr)A (B) = b(F (A), B)\nfor all B \u2208 sl2 (C). If b is chosen to be the trace form, i.e. b(A, B) = tr(AB)\nfor A, B \u2208 sl2 (C), one obtains that F (A) = A \u2212 21 tr A * id for A \u2208 SL2 (C).\nNote that by virtue of this formula Ad(A)F (A) = F (A), i.e. F (A) \u2208 sl2 (C)\nis Ad(A)-invariant.\nIf we identify the fiber of E\u03c1 over \u03b3(0) with sl2 (C), then the Ad(\u03c1(\u03b3))invariant element F (\u03c1(\u03b3)) \u2208 sl2 (C) defines a parallel section \u03c3\u03b3 on a collar\nC = [0, 1] \u00d7 S1 to the left of \u03b3, i.e. \u2202C = \u03b3 0\u22121 \u222a \u03b3, taking into account the\norientations of \u03b3 and the surface S. Let \u03c6 : [0, 1] \u2192 [0, 1], z 7\u2192 \u03c6(z) be a\n9\n\n\fsmooth function which vanishes near z = 0 and is identically 1 near z = 1.\nWe set\n\u03c9\u03b3 = d\u03c6 \u2297 \u03c3\u03b3 \u2208 \u03a91 (S; E\u03c1 ).\nLet X\u03b3 = [\u03c9\u03b3 ] \u2208 H 1 (S; E\u03c1 ). We claim that \u03a9(X\u03b3 , [\u03b7]) = d tr\u03b3 ([\u03b7]) for all\nclosed \u03b7 \u2208 \u03a91 (S, E\u03c1 ). Note that bE\u03c1 (\u03c9 \u2227 \u03b7) = d(\u03c6 * bE\u03c1 (\u03c3\u03b3 \u2227 \u03b7)) since \u03c3\u03b3 and\nbE\u03c1 are parallel. Applying Stokes' theorem we obtain\nZ\nZ\nZ\nE\u03c1\nE\u03c1\nb (\u03c9\u03b3 \u2227 \u03b7) =\n\u03c6 * b (\u03c3\u03b3 \u2227 \u03b7) = bE\u03c1 (\u03c3\u03b3 \u2227 \u03b7).\nS\n\n\u2202C\n\n\u03b3\n\nOn the other hand\nR\n\nd tr\u03b3 ([\u03b7]) = (d tr)\u03c1(\u03b3) ( \u03b3 \u03b7) = b(F (\u03c1(\u03b3)),\n\nR\n\nZ\n\u03b3 \u03b7)\n\n=\n\nbE\u03c1 (\u03c3\u03b3 \u2227 \u03b7)\n\n\u03b3\n\nR\n\nwhere \u03b3 \u03b7 \u2208 sl2 (C) is defined using parallel transport in E\u03c1 along \u03b3, cf. [Wei2]\nfor details. The claim follows.\nLet now C = {\u03b31 , . . . , \u03b33g\u22123 } be a pair-of-pants decomposition of S. We\nmay arrange that the supports of the forms \u03c9\u03b31 , . . . , \u03c9\u03b33g\u22123 are disjoint, hence\nwe immediately deduce the following result of Goldman, cf. Prop. 2.2.2 and\nCor. 2.2.3 in [Gol5]:\nProposition 2.1. The functions tr\u03b31 , . . . , tr\u03b33g\u22123 Poisson-commute pairwise, i.e. \u03a9(X\u03b3i , X\u03b3j ) = 0 for all 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 3g \u2212 3.\nIn particular, the complex Hamiltonian flows \u03c6iz associated with the\nfunctions tr\u03b3i commute and define a local holomorphic C3g\u22123 -action\n\u03c6z = \u03c61z1 \u25e6 . . . \u25e6 \u03c63g\u22123\nz3g\u22123\non Xirr (\u03c01 S, SL2 (C)), where z = (z1 , . . . , z3g\u22123 ) \u2208 C3g\u22123 (for kzk sufficiently\nsmall). Under the assumption that the differentials d tr\u03b31 , . . . , d tr\u03b33g\u22123 are\nlinearly independent at \u03c70 \u2208 Xirr (\u03c01 S, SL2 (C)), one thus obtains a holomorphic completely integrable system\ntr~\u03b3 = (tr\u03b31 , . . . , tr\u03b33g\u22123 ) : Xirr (\u03c01 S, SL2 (C)) \u2283 U \u2192 C3g\u22123 .\nBy choosing a local section\n\u03c3 : C3g\u22123 \u2283 V \u2192 tr~\u03b3\u22121 (V) \u2282 Xirr (\u03c01 S, SL2 (C))\nwith \u03c3(tr~\u03b3 (\u03c70 )) = \u03c70 we obtain local \"action-angle\" coordinates\nXirr (\u03c01 S, SL2 (C)) \u2283 U \u2192 C3g\u22123 \u00d7 C3g\u22123\n\u03c7 7\u2192 (tr~\u03b3 (\u03c7), \u03c4~\u03b3 (\u03c7))\n\n10\n\n\fnear \u03c70 ; they are defined by requiring that \u03c7 = \u03c6\u03c4~\u03b3 (\u03c7) (\u03c3(tr~\u03b3 (\u03c7)) for \u03c7 \u2208 U\nand using the implicit function theorem. This set of coordinates will be\nfurther discussed in section 2.2.\nAs explained by Goldman in [Gol5], the complex Hamiltonian flow \u03c6z\non Xirr (\u03c01 S, SL2 (C)) associated with the function tr\u03b3 is covered by a holomorphic flow \u03c8z on Rirr (\u03c01 S, SL2 (C)). This complex twist flow can be quite\nexplicitly described as follows (we have to be rather careful about various\nchoices in order to match the directions of the flows):\n1. If \u03b3 is separating, then \u03c01 S splits as an amalgamated free product. Let\nS1 denote the component of S cut along \u03b3 lying to the left of \u03b3, taking\ninto account the orientations of \u03b3 and the surface S. Let S2 denote\nthe component lying to the right of \u03b3. Then \u03c01 S = \u03c01 S1 ?\u03b3 \u03c01 S2 . For\n\u03c1 \u2208 R(\u03c01 S, SL2 (C)) and z \u2208 C we set\n\u001a\n\u03c1(\u03b3 0 )\n: \u03b3 0 \u2208 \u03c01 S1\n0\n\u03c8z (\u03c1)(\u03b3 ) =\n,\n0\n\u03b6z \u03c1(\u03b3 )\u03b6\u2212z : \u03b3 0 \u2208 \u03c01 S2\nwhere \u03b6z denotes the complex 1-parameter subgroup in SL2 (C) associated with \u03c1(\u03b3). More precisely, if F : SL2 (C) \u2192 sl2 (C) is the variation\nfunction with respect to the trace form b, then \u03b6z = exp(zF (\u03c1(\u03b3))).\nNote in particular that \u03b6z centralizes \u03c1(\u03b3) in SL2 (C). To check that\nthe flows match, we calculate the periods of \u03c9\u03b3 :\n\u001a\nZ\n0\n: \u03b3 0 \u2208 \u03c01 S1\n\u03c9\u03b3 =\n0\n(1 \u2212 (Ad \u25e6\u03c1)(\u03b3 ))F (\u03c1(\u03b3)) : \u03b3 0 \u2208 \u03c01 S2\n\u03b30\n=\n\nd\n0\n0 \u22121\ndz z=0 \u03c8z (\u03c1)(\u03b3 )\u03c1(\u03b3 ) .\n\n2. If \u03b3 is non-separating, then \u03c01 S splits as an HNN-extension. Let S 0\ndenote the connected surface obtained by cutting S along \u03b3. Then\n\u03c01 S = \u03c01 S 0 ?\u03b3 . More precisely, let \u03bb be another simple closed curve\nintersecting \u03b3 transversally at the base-point with positive intersection\nnumber. This determines an arc, again denoted by \u03bb, in S 0 connecting\n\u2202+ S 0 to \u2202\u2212 S 0 . If we place the base-point on \u2202\u2212 S 0 and denote the\nelement in \u03c01 S 0 corresponding to \u03b3 by \u03b3\u2212 , then with \u03b3+ = \u03bb\u22121 ? \u03b3 ? \u03bb\nwe get \u03c01 S = h\u03c01 S 0 , \u03bb|\u03bb\u22121 \u03b3\u2212 \u03bb = \u03b3+ i. For \u03c1 \u2208 R(\u03c01 S, SL2 (C)) and\nz \u2208 C we set\n\u001a\n\u03c1(\u03b3 0 ) : \u03b3 0 \u2208 \u03c01 S 0\n0\n\u03c8z (\u03c1)(\u03b3 ) =\n,\n\u03b6z \u03c1(\u03bb) :\n\u03b30 = \u03bb\nwith \u03b6z = exp(zF (\u03c1(\u03b3))) as above. Again as a check we calculate the\nperiods of \u03c9\u03b3 :\n\u001a\nZ\n0\n: \u03b3 0 \u2208 \u03c01 S 0\n\u03c9\u03b3 =\nF (\u03c1(\u03b3)) :\n\u03b30 = \u03bb\n\u03b30\n=\n\nd\n0\n0 \u22121\ndz z=0 \u03c8z (\u03c1)(\u03b3 )\u03c1(\u03b3 ) .\n\n11\n\n\fThe significance of this for us is that we can easily reconstruct \u03c7 \u2208 U from\nits coordinates tr~\u03b3 (\u03c7) and \u03c4~\u03b3 (\u03c7) once we know the local section \u03c3.\n\n2.2\n\nAction-angle coordinates\n\nWe return now to our 3-dimensional situation, i.e. X is a closed, orientable\nhyperbolic cone-3-manifold with smooth part M = X \\ \u03a3 and S = \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 ;\nwe will furthermore assume that all the cone angles are smaller than 2\u03c0.\nThe hyperbolic metric on M determines a holonomy representation hol :\n\u03c01 M \u2192 SL2 (C), which in turns induces on \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 a representation \u03c10 \u2208\nR(\u03c01 \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 , SL2 (C)), with corresponding character \u03c70 = [\u03c10 ].\nFor each edge ei of the singular locus, let \u03bci \u2282 \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 be a meridian of ei ,\ni.e. a simple closed curve winding exactly once around ei . The collection \u03bc\n~=\n{\u03bc1 , . . . , \u03bcN } decomposes \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 into a family of k subsurfaces {\u03a31 , . . . , \u03a3k },\neach of which is homeomorphic to the regular part Nj of the link of a vertex\nvj ; in the following we will always identify \u03a3j and Nj .\nAs in [Mon, Wei4] we find the following (see [Mon] for a detailed proof,\nwhere this result appears as Theorem 6):\nLemma 2.2. hol : \u03c01 Nj \u2192 SL2 (C) is irreducible.\nActually, the induced holonomy on Nj fixes a point in H3 (corresponding\nto the vertex vj ), so has values in a maximal compact subgroup K of SL2 (C);\nup to conjugacy we can assume K = SU(2).\nFor each 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k, let Cj be a pair-of-pants decomposition of Nj .\nIf we cut Nj along Cj we obtain a disjoint collection Pj,1 , . . . , Pj,mj \u22123 of\nsubsurfaces, each homeomorphic to a thrice punctured sphere.\nDefinition 2.3. Let S be a surface and \u03c1 : \u03c01 S \u2192 SL2 (C) an irreducible\nrepresentation. A pair-of-pants decomposition C of S is called \u03c1-admissible\n(or just admissible for short) if the restriction of \u03c1 to each of the pairs of\npants obtained by cutting S along C is irreducible.\nA natural question is whether an admissible pair-of-pants decomposition\nfor Nj always exists. This is settled by the following:\nProposition 2.4. Let S be a d-punctured sphere and \u03c1 : \u03c01 S \u2192 SU(2) an\nirreducible representation, such that the holonomy of any peripheral element\nis non-trivial. Then S admits a \u03c1-admissible pair-of pants decomposition.\nProof. The proof is by induction on d. If d = 3, then the result is\ntrivial, so we will now assume that d > 3. Since \u03c1 has values in SU(2),\nit is reducibleQif and only if all the elements of its image commute. Let\nh\u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3d |\ni \u03b3i = 1i be a presentation of \u03c01 S such that \u03b3i is a loop\naround the i-th puncture of S. Since \u03c1 is irreducible, up to a change in the\norder of the generators we can assume that \u03c1(\u03b31 ) and \u03c1(\u03b32 ) do not commute.\n12\n\n\fThe curve \u03b31 .\u03b32 (or rather, any simple closed curve homotopic to \u03b31 .\u03b32 ) cuts\nS into a pair-of-pants P 0 and a (d \u2212 1)-punctured sphere S 0 . The induced\nrepresentation on P is generated by \u03c1(\u03b31 ) and \u03c1(\u03b32 ) and is thus irreducible.\nIf the induced representation on S 0 is also irreducible, then by induction we\ncan find an admissible decomposition of S 0 and the proof is completed. If on\nthe other hand the induced representation on S 0 is reducible, this means that\nthere exists a complex line L which is invariant by \u03c1(\u03b3i ) for all 3 \u2264 i \u2264 d. If L\nis invariant by \u03c1(\u03b32 ), then it is also invariant by \u03c1(\u03b31 ) = (\u03c1(\u03b32 ) . . . \u03c1(\u03b3d ))\u22121 ,\nand this contradicts the irreducibility of \u03c1. So L is not invariant by \u03c1(\u03b32 );\nsimilarly, it is not invariant by \u03c1(\u03b31 ). Now any simple closed curve homotopic to \u03b32 .\u03b33 cuts S into a pair-of-pants P 00 and a (d \u2212 1)-punctured\nsphere S 00 . The induced representation on P 00 is generated by \u03c1(\u03b32 ) and\n\u03c1(\u03b33 ), and they do not commute since L is invariant by \u03c1(\u03b33 ), which is not\ntrivial, but not by \u03c1(\u03b32 ); this implies that the induced representation on\nthis pair-of-pants is irreducible. Similarly, the induced representation on S 00\nis irreducible since it is generated by \u03c1(\u03b31 ), \u03c1(\u03b34 ), . . . , \u03c1(\u03b3d ), which do not\ncommute.\n\u001e\nThe same argument shows that under the same assumptions, any simple\nclosed curve \u03b3 \u2282 S with the property that \u03c1(\u03b3) is non-trivial and that\nthe restriction of \u03c1 to each component obtained by cutting S along \u03b3 is\nirreducible, can be completed to an admissible pair-of-pants decomposition\nof S. In the case where S = Nj and \u03c1 = \u03c10 , the peripheral elements are\nactually edges' meridians whose holonomy is non-trivial since the cone angles\nare smaller than 2\u03c0, so the proposition applies.\nLemma 2.5. Let S be a d-punctured sphere and \u03c1 : \u03c01 S \u2192 SL2 (C) an irreducible representation. Let {\u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3d } be the boundary curves of S and\nassume that the pair-of-pants decomposition C = {\u03b3d+1 , . . . , \u03b32d\u22123 } is admissible. Then the map\n(tr\u03b31 , . . . , tr\u03b32d\u22123 ) : Xirr (\u03c01 S, SL2 (C)) \u2192 C2d\u22123\nis a submersion at \u03c1.\nThe proof of this lemma is based on the following elementary fact (see\nfor instance [Gol4], p. 578):\nLemma 2.6. Consider the map\nf : SL2 (C) \u00d7 SL2 (C) \u2192 C3\n(A, B) 7\u2192 (tr A, tr B, tr AB).\nThen df(A,B) is surjective if and only if A and B do not commute.\nLet now P be a thrice punctured sphere and \u03c01 P = h\u03b31 , \u03b32 , \u03b33 | \u03b31 \u03b32 \u03b33 i\na presentation of its fundamental group. Lemma 2.6 may be translated into\nthe following equivalent statement:\n13\n\n\fCorollary 2.7. Consider the map\ntr~\u03b3 = (tr\u03b31 , tr\u03b32 , tr\u03b33 ) : X(\u03c01 P, SL2 (C)) \u2192 C3 .\nThen (d tr~\u03b3 )\u03c1 is surjective if and only if \u03c1 is nonabelian.\nWe can then use the standard gluing construction as explained in [Mon]\nand [Wei2, Wei4] together with Corollary 2.7 to finish the proof of Lemma\n2.5.\nRecall that for each 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k, Cj is a pair-of-pants decomposition of the\nsmooth part Nj of the j-th vertex's link, and that the set \u03bc\n~ = {\u03bc1 , . . . , \u03bcN }\nS\nconsists of all the edges' meridians. Let ~\u03bd = kj=1 Cj = {\u03bd1 , . . . , \u03bd3g\u22123\u2212N }\nP\n(where g stands for the genus of \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 , so that kj=1 (mj \u2212 3) = 3g \u2212 3 \u2212 N ,\nwith mj being the valence of the j-th vertex). Then the collection C = \u03bc\n~ \u222a ~\u03bd\nis a pair-of-pants decomposition of \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 , which is admissible if and only if\nall the Cj are admissible. To this decomposition we associate the two trace\nmaps\ntr\u03bc~ = (tr\u03bc1 , . . . , tr\u03bcN ) : X(\u03c01 \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 , SL2 (C)) \u2192 CN\nand\ntr~\u03bd = (tr\u03bd1 , . . . , tr\u03bd3g\u22123\u2212N ) : X(\u03c01 \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 , SL2 (C)) \u2192 C3g\u22123\u2212N .\nProposition 2.8. Assume that C = \u03bc\n~ \u222a ~\u03bd is \u03c10 -admissible. Then the map\nTrC = (tr\u03bc~ , tr~\u03bd ) : Xirr (\u03c01 \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 , SL2 (C)) \u2192 C3g\u22123\nis a submersion at \u03c70 .\nThe proof uses the standard gluing construction as in Lemma 2.5. Further details are left to the reader.\nIf C = \u03bc\n~ \u222a ~\u03bd is admissible for \u03c10 , then upon choosing a local section for\nthe map (tr\u03bc~ , tr~\u03bd ), we obtain using Proposition 2.8 together with Proposition\n2.1 and the ensuing discussion local action-angle coordinates near \u03c70 = [\u03c10 ]:\nXirr (\u03c01 \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 , SL2 (C)) \u2283 U \u2192 CN \u00d7 C3g\u22123\u2212N \u00d7 CN \u00d7 C3g\u22123\u2212N\n\u03c7 7\u2192 (tr\u03bc~ , tr~\u03bd , \u03c4\u03bc~ , \u03c4~\u03bd )\n\nRemark 2.9. (Warning) The \"action-angle\" terminology, while customary, is somewhat misleading in our context. Indeed, it is the action variables\ntr\u03bci and tr\u03bdi that actually involve the cone angles via the trace of the holonomy of elliptic isometries. We will see that the \"angle\" variables \u03c4\u03bci and \u03c4\u03bdi\nhave little to do with the cone angles but are rather related to the lengths\nof the edges.\n14\n\n\fIn our 3-dimensional setting we can give a more geometric description of\nthe angle-coordinates \u03c4\u03bc~ and \u03c4~\u03bd . But since they depend on \u03c3, we will first\nlook at the most natural choice for this local section.\nLet Nj be the regular part of the link of a singular vertex of X; we\nknow that the induced holonomy representation on Nj fixes a point pj \u2208 H3\nand hence has values in a maximal compact subgroup Kj of SL2 (C). In\nparticular, the induced holonomy representation on any of the pair-of-pants\nof the admissible decomposition of Nj has values in this maximal compact\nsubgroup, which is conjugated to SU(2) inside SL2 (C). A first consequence\nof this fact is that TrC (\u03c70 ) actually belongs to (\u22122, 2)3g\u22123 \u2282 C3g\u22123 .\nLet t = (t1 , . . . , t3g\u22123 ) \u2208 R3g\u22123 . Let \u03b3j1 , \u03b3j2 , \u03b3j3 \u2208 Cj be the boundary\ncurves of a pair-of-pants P in the decomposition of Nj . If t is close enough\nto TrC (\u03c70 ), then there exists a unique (up to conjugation) representation\n\u03c1P (t) : \u03c01 P \u2192 Kj such that tr(\u03c1P (t)(\u03b3ji )) = tji for i \u2208 {1, 2, 3}; and we\ncan proceed in the same way for all the pairs-of-pants of the decomposition. It is then possible to glue these representations together to obtain\nan element \u03c1Nj (t) \u2208 Rirr (\u03c01 Nj , Kj ). The representations \u03c1Nj (t) may then\nagain be glued together to obtain \u03c1(t) \u2208 Rirr (\u03c01 \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 , SL2 (C)) such that\nTrC ([\u03c1(t)]) = t. Such an element \u03c1(t) is not unique, but this shows that\nwe can choose a neighbourhood V \u2282 C3g\u22123 of TrC (\u03c70 ) and a local section\n\u03c3 : V \u2192 Xirr (\u03c01 \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 , SL2 (C)) of TrC such that for any t \u2208 V \u2229 R3g\u22123 , \u03c3(t) is\nthe character of a representation \u03c1(t) with the property that the restriction\nof \u03c1(t) to \u03c01 Nj has values in a maximal compact subgroup Kj (t) for all\nj = 1, . . . , k. Note that in general we cannot achieve that Kj (t) = Kj for\nall t \u2208 V \u2229 R3g\u22123 .\nWe want to understand how the complex twist flows \u03c8zi act on the holonomy representation \u03c10 of the hyperbolic cone-manifold structure (or more\ngenerally, on a representation \u03c1(t) as constructed above). If A \u2208 SL2 (C)\ncorresponds to an elliptic isometry, we may assume w.l.o.g. that\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03bb 0\nA=\n0 \u03bb\u0304\nfor \u03bb \u2208 U(1). If we set \u03bb = ei\u03b1/2 for \u03b1 \u2208 R (i.e. A corresponds to an elliptic\nisometry with (oriented) rotation angle \u03b1), then the complex 1-parameter\nsubgroup \u03b6z corresponding to A is given by\n\u0014 iz sin(\u03b1/2)\n\u0015\ne\n0\n\u03b6z =\n.\n0\ne\u2212iz sin(\u03b1/2)\nThe corresponding group of isometries preserves the axis \u03b40 = {0} \u00d7 R+ \u2282\nC \u00d7 R+ in the upper half-space model of H3 . In particular,\n\u0014 it sin(\u03b1/2)\n\u0015\ne\n0\n\u03b6t =\n,t \u2208 R\n0\ne\u2212it sin(\u03b1/2)\n15\n\n\fis a real 1-parameter group of rotations fixing \u03b40 with (oriented) rotation\nangle given by 2t sin(\u03b1/2). Similarly,\n\u0014 \u2212t sin(\u03b1/2)\n\u0015\ne\n0\n\u03b6it =\n,t \u2208 R\n0\net sin(\u03b1/2)\nis a real 1-parameter group of translations along \u03b40 with (signed) translation\nlength given by \u22122t sin(\u03b1/2).\nThis yields a rather concrete description of representations \u03c1 with character \u03c7 \u2208 U in terms of action-angle coordinates. The most relevant situation\nfor us is when TrC (\u03c7) \u2208 (\u22122, 2)3g\u22123 (such representations provide candidates for holonomy representations of cone-manifold structures compatible\nwith ~\u03bd in the sense of Definition 4.1). In this case, as a consequence of the\nparticular choice of the local section \u03c3 as described above, we obtain that\nvanishing of the imaginary parts of the angle coordinates \u03c4~\u03bd for a character \u03c7 implies that \u03c1(\u03c01 Nj ) is contained in a maximal compact subgroup\nKj (\u03c1) for all j = 1, . . . , k. This corresponds geometrically to a deformation\nkeeping the topological type (X, \u03a3) fixed. Giving the angle-coordinate \u03c4\u03bdi\na non-zero imaginary part amounts to splitting along \u03bdi the link Nj that\ncontains this curve into components Nj0 and Nj00 and separating the fixed\npoints of \u03c1(\u03c01 Nj0 ) and \u03c1(\u03c01 Nj00 ) in H3 by some positive distance. This corresponds geometrically to a splitting deformation as described in the following\nsections.\n\n2.3\n\nL2 -cohomology\n\nIn the beginning of section 2.1 we have introduced the flat sl2 (C)-bundle\nE\u03c1 = S\u0303 \u00d7Ad \u25e6\u03c1 sl2 (C) over a surface S, associated to a representation \u03c1. In\nthe same way, we can define over the smooth part M of the cone-manifold\nX a bundle\nE = M\u0303 \u00d7Ad \u25e6 hol sl2 (C),\nwhere hol : \u03c01 M \u2192 SL2 (C) is the holonomy representation of the hyperbolic\nstructure on M . This bundle E carries a natural flat connection \u2207E . It is\ncanonically identified with the bundle of infinitesimal isometries so(T M ) \u2295\nT M ; this identification gives a natural metric hE on E (the direct sum\ndecomposition is not preserved by the connection, so that hE is not parallel\nwith respect to \u2207E ). Using Weil's construction and de Rham's theorem one\nobtains\nT\u03c70 X(\u03c01 M, SL2 (C)) \u223c\n= H 1 (\u03c01 M ; sl2 (C)Ad \u25e6 hol ) \u223c\n= H 1 (M ; E).\nNote further that using the hyperbolic metric g on M and the bundle metric\nhE , the L2 -cohomology groups HLi 2 (M ; E) are defined. For details concerning\nthese constructions we refer the reader to our earlier works. If Nj is the\n16\n\n\fsmooth part of the j-th link, then hol(\u03c01 Nj ) fixes a point pj \u2208 H3 , i.e. is\nconjugated into SU(2). As a consequence one has the following splitting:\nE|Nj = Ej1 \u2295 Ej2 ,\nwhere the first summand corresponds to infinitesimal rotations about pj and\nthe second one to infinitesimal translations at pj . The following has been\nproven in [Wei4]:\nTheorem 2.10. Let c \u2208 HL1 2 (M ; E) be a class with the property that for all\nvertices vj the following holds:\nc|H 1\n\nL2\n\n(Nj ;Ej1 )\n\n=0\n\nor\n\nc|H 1\n\nL2\n\n(Nj ;Ej2 )\n\n= 0.\n\nThen c = 0.\nAs a consequence we obtain that the map H 1 (M\u0304\u03b5 ; E) \u2192 H 1 (\u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 ; E)\nis injective, so that we will identify H 1 (M\u0304\u03b5 ;P\nE) with its image, and that\ndimC H 1 (M\u0304\u03b5 ; E) = 21 dimC H 1 (\u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 ; E) = N + kj=1 (mj \u2212 3), cf. Proposition\n4.7 in [Wei4].\nThe following is the main result of this section:\nTheorem 2.11. Let C = \u03bc\n~ \u222a ~\u03bd be a pair-of-pants decomposition of \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 .\nAssume that C is admissible for \u03c10 = hol and U is a neighbourhood of \u03c70 in\nXirr (\u03c01 \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 , SL2 (C)), on which action-angle coordinates are defined. Then\nthe map\n\u03a6C : U \u2229 X(\u03c01 M, SL2 (C)) \u2192 CN \u00d7 R3g\u22123\u2212N \u00d7 R3g\u22123\u2212N\n\u03c7 7\u2192 (tr\u03bc~ (\u03c7), Im \u03c4~\u03bd (\u03c7), Im tr~\u03bd (\u03c7))\nis a local diffeomorphism at \u03c70 .\nProof. Let L := ker(d\u03a6C )\u03c70 \u2282 H 1 (\u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 ; E), where as usual H 1 (\u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 ; E)\nis identified with T\u03c70 X(\u03c01 \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 , SL2 (C)). We claim that\nL \u2229 H 1 (M\u0304\u03b5 ; E) = {0},\nwhere according to the remark following Theorem 2.10 the space H 1 (M\u0304\u03b5 ; E)\nis identified with a subspace of H 1 (\u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 ; E).\nLet now c \u2208 L \u2229 H 1 (M\u0304\u03b5 ; E). In particular, c \u2208 ker(d tr\u03bc~ )\u03c70 , hence by\nCorollary 4.17 in [Wei4], c \u2208 HL1 2 (M ; E). Note that by Corollary 4.4 in\n[Wei4] the space HL1 2 (M ; E) may be identified with a subspace of H 1 (M\u0304\u03b5 ; E).\nFinally, since Im(d tr~\u03bd )\u03c70 (c) = Im(d\u03c4~\u03bd )\u03c70 (c) = 0, the restriction of c to\nNj is tangent to a path of characters [\u03c1t ] with \u03c1t : \u03c01 Nj \u2192 SU(2) for all\nj = 1, . . . , k. This implies that\nc|H 1\n\nL2\n\n(Nj ;Ej2 )\n\n17\n\n=0\n\n\ffor all j = 1, . . . , k. Hence Theorem 2.10 applies to yield c = 0. It follows\nthat \u03a6C is an immersion at \u03c70 . Now\ndimR X(\u03c01 M\u0304\u03b5 , SL2 (C)) = 2N +\n\nk\nX\n\n2(mj \u2212 3)\n\nj=1\n\nsuch that the result follows.\n\n\u001e\n\nRemark 2.12. The same argument shows that (tr\u03bc~ , Re tr~\u03bd , Re \u03c4~\u03bd ) also provides a system of local coordinates near \u03c70 . However, as we will see later,\nthe coordinate system of Theorem 2.11 is better adapted for our purposes.\n\n3\n\nDeformations of the singular tube\n\nLet X be a closed hyperbolic cone-3-manifold. The topologies of the singular\nlocus \u03a3 and of \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 are closely related, apart from the obvious one-to-one\ncorrespondence between the components of \u03a3 and those of \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 : each component of \u03a3 is a (compact) connected graph, hence is homotopy equivalent\nto a bouquet of g circles, where g is precisely the genus of the corresponding\ncomponent of \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 .\nLet X 0 be a deformation of X, i.e. X and X 0 have diffeomorphic regular\nparts M and M 0 , and the respective hyperbolic structures on M and M 0\nare close. The boundary surfaces \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 and \u2202 M\u0304\u03b50 are diffeomorphic, so by\nthe above remark the singular loci \u03a3 and \u03a30 are homotopy equivalent. This\nimplies that it is possible to go from one singular locus to the other by\nshrinking some edges to zero and splitting some vertices. But by continuity\nof the lengths of the edges, if X 0 and X are close enough then the only\npossibility is that \u03a30 is obtained from \u03a3 by splitting some (possibly zero)\nvertices, that is, X 0 has some \"new\" singular edges as compared to X.\nIn order to study the deformations of X, we begin with the less obstructed problem of constructing deformations of the singular tube U\u03b5 (\u03a3).\nWe will then see (in section 4) when they can be extended to the whole of\nM . The possible deformations of a singular tube are quite easy to classify\n(cf. [MM2], section 3).\n\u2022 We can change the lengths and/or twist parameters of the existing\nedges.\n\u2022 We can deform the spherical structure of the vertices' links, with or\nwithout changing the cone angles. In the latter case, this also implies\nchanging the cone angles of the existing edges.\n\u2022 Finally, we can split some vertices to create new edges.\n\n18\n\n\fThe last case is clearly the most complicated. Topologically, such a deformation is described by specifying the meridian of the new edge, see Fig. 1,\nbut the actual geometric description is more complicated. In fact, to ensure the existence of the splitting deformation we will need an additional\nassumption.\n\n3.1\n\nThe splitting condition\n\nWe now introduce a geometric condition on a simple closed curve, which we\ncall the splitting condition. This condition complements the more algebraic\ncondition of admissibility of a pair-of-pants decomposition in the formulation\nof our main results.\nLet N be an incomplete oriented spherical surface, for instance the\nsmooth part of a spherical cone-surface, and let \u03b3 be a closed curve on N . We\ncan choose a base-point x on \u03b3, so that \u03b3 defines an element of \u03c01 (N, x). The\nspherical structure on N allows us to define a developing map dev : \u00d1 \u2192 S2\nand associated holonomy representation \u03c1 : \u03c01 (N, x) \u2192 Isom+ (S2 ). The image of \u03b3 by \u03c1 is then a direct isometry of S2 . If we assume that this isometry\nf is not trivial, it has exactly two fixed points, denoted by F ix(f ).\nLet r and \u03b8 be polar coordinates in S2 \\ F ix(f ). The angular variable\n\u03b8 is only defined modulo 2\u03c0, but the corresponding 1-form d\u03b8 and Killing\nvector field \u2202/\u2202\u03b8 are well-defined, and are invariant by f . In particular,\nd\u03b8 (resp. \u2202/\u2202\u03b8) descends to a 1-form (resp. local Killing vector field) in a\nneighbourhood of \u03b3. Actually, since d\u03b8 is not defined on the whole of S2\n(it has singularities at F ix(f )), the corresponding 1-form along \u03b3 may be\nsingular.\nDefinition 3.1. With the above notations, we say that a simple closed curve\non N with non-trivial holonomy satisfies the splitting condition (or is splittable) if it is transverse to the 1-form d\u03b8 (i.e. the tangent direction to the\ncurve at any point does not lie in ker d\u03b8; in particular d\u03b8 has no singularity\nalong the curve).\nAn important fact is that this property is open, and in particular still\nholds if N is slightly deformed:\nLemma 3.2. Let \u03b3 be a simple closed curve on N . Then the set of spherical\nmetrics on N for which \u03b3 is splittable is open.\nIndeed, small perturbations of the spherical metric induce small perturbations of d\u03b8, so that the transversality condition is preserved.\nOn the set of splittable curves on N , we define a new equivalence relation\nrefining the one given by homotopy and say that two simple closed curves\non N satisfying the splitting condition are equivalent if they are homotopic\nthrough splittable curves. In particular, equivalent splittable curves will play\n19\n\n\fexactly the same role in the remainder of the article. The following result\nshows that in a given homotopy class there can be at most two distinct\nequivalence classes of splittable curves:\nProposition 3.3. Let \u03b31 and \u03b32 be two homotopic splittable curves on N .\nThe 1-form d\u03b8 defined in aR neighbourhood\nof \u03b31 can be uniquely extended to\nR\na neighbourhood of \u03b32 . If \u03b31 d\u03b8 and \u03b32 d\u03b8 have the same sign, then \u03b31 and\n\u03b32 are equivalent, i.e. homotopic through splittable curves.\nProof. Let X denote the locally defined vector field sin(r) \u2202/\u2202r spanning\nthe local foliation ker d\u03b8 along \u03b31 where it is nonsingular. After choosing a\nbase-point on \u03b31 , the based homotopy class of \u03b31 defines an element in \u03c01 N .\nWe consider the covering space corresponding to the subgroup generated by\nthis element. The lifts of \u03b31 and \u03b32 to this cover are again simple closed\ncurves. The singular 1-form d\u03b8 and the vector field X also lift as globally\ndefined objects; this justifies the claim about the extension of d\u03b8 to \u03b32 . Up\nto a change of sign of d\u03b8, we can assume that at any point of \u03b31 , the tangent\nvector v satisfies d\u03b8(v) > 0, and similarly for \u03b32 .\nWe will now work entirely on the covering space. Note that the zeroes\nof X are either sources or sinks, i.e. they all have index 0. The obstruction against finding a homotopy from \u03b31 to \u03b32 transverse to ker d\u03b8 is the\npossible existence of zeroes of X, over which we cannot pull \u03b32 without\nlosing transversality. In a first step we can make \u03b31 and \u03b32 transverse to\none another, keeping transversality to ker d\u03b8. If \u03b31 and \u03b32 do not intersect,\nthen they bound an annulus and are both transverse to the vector field X.\nPoincar\u00e9-Hopf now shows that there cannot be any zeroes in the interior of\nthe annulus, hence we can construct a transverse homotopy.\nTo try to reduce to this case, we can divide both curves into subarcs in\nsuch a way that any subarc of \u03b31 together with a corresponding subarc of\n\u03b32 bounds a disk. If such a disk does not contain a zero of X, we can slide\nthis subarc of \u03b32 over the disk to remove two intersection points. After these\nmodifications two possibilities remain: either \u03b31 and \u03b32 do not intersect anymore and we are done, or they still do. In this case, again Poincar\u00e9-Hopf\nshows that any disk bounded by two corresponding subarcs of \u03b31 and \u03b32 contain exactly one zero of X. Now direct inspection shows that on one of the\nsubarc the tangent vector must satisfy d\u03b8(v) < 0, which we had excluded.\nHence we are left with the first case and the proof is finished.\n\u001e\nThe fact that there can exist homotopic but non-equivalent splittable\ncurves is of practical significance for the development of the deformation\ntheory, since it implies that specifying the homotopy class of a new meridian\nis not enough to determine a splitting. It is actually not difficult to construct\na spherical cone-surface with smooth part N and a homotopy class on N\ncontaining two non-equivalent splittable curves, however all the examples\nwe have found so far have some large cone angles (i.e. larger than 2\u03c0). Thus\n20\n\n\fit remains an open question whether such examples can exist in our setting,\nwhere all the cone angles are smaller than 2\u03c0. Of course, intuition suggests\nthat many homotopy classes will not contain any splittable curve at all;\nbut as we will see later, infinitely many non-homotopic curves satisfying the\nsplitting condition can exist on a spherical cone-surface.\nA related, useful notion is that of the cone angle along a curve:\nDefinition 3.4. Let N be an incomplete oriented spherical surface. We say\nthat a closed curve on N is non-singular if its holonomy is not trivial and\nthe 1-form d\u03b8 along it is notR singular. The cone angle along a non-singular\ncurve \u03b3 is then defined as | \u03b3 d\u03b8|.\nIt is an easy exercise to check that if \u03b3 is a loop around a conic point of\na cone-surface, then the cone angle along \u03b3 is exactly the cone angle of this\nconic point; moreover, the cone angle along a curve is always equal modulo\n2\u03c0 to (plus or minus) the rotation angle of its holonomy. Note also that\nthe cone angle along \u03b3 may very well be greater than 2\u03c0, even if N is the\nsmooth part of a spherical cone-surface with cone angles smaller than 2\u03c0\nand \u03b3 is a simple closed curve. Finally, we emphasize that this quantity\n0\nis not homotopy-invariant: if H is a homotopy from\nR \u03b3 to \u03b3R that crosses\na singular point of d\u03b8, then one easily shows that \u03b3 d\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b3 0 d\u03b8 = \u00b12\u03c0,\nwhere the exact sign depends on the direction of the crossing. In particular,\nif \u03b3 is such that d\u03b8 is singular along it, then we can always find a small\nperturbation of \u03b3 for which this is no longer the case, but the resulting cone\nangle may depend on the chosen perturbation. Of course, since this kind of\nhomotopy is forbidden for equivalent splittable curves, the notion of cone\nangle is well-defined for an equivalence class of splittable curves. As we will\nsee in section 3.2, this quantity is actually equal to the cone angle of the\nnew edge obtained by splitting a vertex along a splittable curve.\nSome examples\nLet S be the spherical cone-surface obtained as the double of a spherical\nsquare with angle 2\u03c0/3. This cone-surface is particularly easy to study: it\nhas a non-trivial isometry group, and more importantly, the image of its\nholonomy representation is finite in SU(2) (it covers the group of direct\nisometries of a tetrahedron). It turns out that on S, there exist infinitely\nmany non-homotopic splittable curves, and that the cone angles along such\ncurves can grow arbitrarily large. In Fig. 2 we give some of the simplest\ncurves on S; except for three of them, they are all splittable (actually even\nthe two non-admissible curves satisfy an adapted splitting condition, see the\nend of section 3.2).\nThe first seven depicted curves are obtained by applying iteratively the\nsame half Dehn twist. Let \u03b3k be the curve obtained after k such half Dehn\n21\n\n\fcone angle \u03c0\n\ncone angle 4\u03c0/3\n\nnot admissible\n(cone angle 2\u03c0)\n\ncone angle 8\u03c0/3\n\nnon splittable\n\ncone angle 16\u03c0/3\n\nnot admissible\n(cone angle 6\u03c0)\n\ncone angle 3\u03c0\n\ncone angle 5\u03c0\n\ncone angle 5\u03c0\n\ncone angle 16\u03c0/3\n\ncone angle 20\u03c0/3\n\nFigure 2: The cone angle along some simple closed curves on S.\n\n22\n\n\ftwists. Then one can verify that the homotopy class of \u03b3k always contains a\nsplittable curve (unique up to equivalence) when k is odd, and that its cone\nangle is equal to k\u03c0 + \u03c0/3 if k \u2261 1 mod 4, and k\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0/3 if k \u2261 3 mod 4.\nIn particular, it goes to infinity as k grows to infinity.\nBounding the cone angle\nWe have seen that even if a curve \u03b3 satisfies the splitting condition, the cone\nangle along \u03b3 may well be larger than 2\u03c0. Hence, in general, a splitting\ndeformation will not preserve the class of hyperbolic cone-3-manifolds with\ncone angles less than 2\u03c0. However, if \u03b3 has special extrinsic geometry, then\nthe cone angle along \u03b3 can in fact be bounded from above:\nProposition 3.5. Let L be a spherical cone-surface with cone angles less\nthan 2\u03c0 and N its smooth part. If \u03b3 is a simple closed curve on N of\nconstant geodesic\ncurvature \u03ba \u2208 [0, \u221e), then the length of \u03b3 is less than or\n\u221a\nequal to 2\u03c0/ 1 + \u03ba2 , which is precisely the length of such a curve on the\nstandard round 2-sphere.\nProof. It is a classical result of Toponogov, cf. [Top], that a simple closed\ngeodesic on a simply connected smooth surface with Gauss curvature K \u2265 1\nhas length less than or equal to 2\u03c0. Moreover, equality can only occur on the\nstandard round 2-sphere. An exposition of this appears in [Kli] on p. 297.\nApplying this result to smoothings of L yields the same statement for simple\nclosed geodesics on N .\nHaving established the assertion for simple closed geodesics, we can argue\nas follows in the general case: Suppose there exists a spherical cone-surface\nwith cone angles less than 2\u03c0 and a simple\n\u221a closed curve \u03b3 of constant geodesic\ncurvature \u03ba, but with length l > 2\u03c0/ 1 + \u03ba2 . Clearly this curve cannot be\nperipheral, since the cone angles are less than 2\u03c0. If we cut our cone-surface\nalong \u03b3, we obtain a piece with convex boundary and a piece with concave\nboundary. Take the convex\npiece and add the region of a spherical football\n\u221a\n2\nof cone angle \u03b1 = l 1 + \u03ba (i.e. the spherical suspension over a circle of\nlength \u03b1) bounded by the closed geodesic of length \u03b1 > 2\u03c0 and the circle\nof constant geodesic curvature \u03ba. We may now double to obtain a spherical cone-surface with cone angles less than 2\u03c0 containing a simple closed\ngeodesic of length greater than 2\u03c0, which contradicts Topogonov's result. \u001e\nAn immediate consequence is the following:\nCorollary 3.6. If \u03b3 is as above and has non-trivial holonomy, then the cone\nangle along \u03b3 is less than 2\u03c0.\n\n23\n\n\f3.2\n\nSplitting deformations\n\nThe splittable case\nLet S be a spherical cone-surface with smooth part N and holonomy representation % : \u03c01 N \u2192 K \u2282 SL2 (C), and let \u03bd be a simple closed curve on\nN with non-trivial holonomy. Let C be the untruncated hyperbolic cone\nover S. It is a complete, infinite volume hyperbolic cone-3-manifold, with\na unique singular vertex (the summit of the cone) and singular edges corresponding to the cone points of S. We want to construct a one-parameter\nfamily of cone-manifolds, obtained from C by splitting its vertex in such a\nway that the new edge has \u03bd as a meridian. If \u03bd satisfies the splitting condition, there is a natural way to proceed, and the resulting one-parameter\nfamily Cl , l \u2265R 0, is then called a splitting deformation of C along \u03bd.\nLet \u03b1 = | \u03bd d\u03b8| be the cone angle of \u03bd. The football of angle \u03b1, denoted\nby S2\u03b1 , is defined as the only (up to isometry) spherical cone-surface with\nunderlying space S2 and two cone-points of angle \u03b1; it can be constructed\nas the spherical suspension over a circle of length \u03b1. More relevantly, in our\ncase, if r and \u03b8 are polar coordinates on the universal cover of S2 \\F ix(%(\u03bd)),\nthen S2\u03b1 is the metric completion of the quotient of this universal cover under\nthe identification (r, \u03b8) \u223c (r, \u03b8+\u03b1). It is then possible to embed isometrically\na neighbourhood of \u03bd in S2\u03b1 ; the image of \u03bd by this embedding will be denoted\nby \u03bd 0 .\nThe hyperbolic cone C(\u03bd) over \u03bd separates C into two \"cone-manifolds\nwith boundary\" C1 and C2 ; if \u03bd is smooth, the boundary \u2202Ci = C(\u03bd) is a\nsmooth surface except at the singular vertex. Now let T be the untruncated\nhyperbolic cone over S2\u03b1 . It is an infinite singular tube, with a unique singular\nedge of cone angle \u03b1. The cone over \u03bd 0 is a surface B1 = C(\u03bd 0 ) in T , and since\n\u03bd and \u03bd 0 have isometric neighbourhoods, C(\u03bd) and C(\u03bd 0 ) are isometric and\nhave isometric conic neighbourhoods. Let B2 be the image of B1 = C(\u03bd 0 )\nby a hyperbolic translation of length l along the singular edge of T . The\nfact that \u03bd satisfies the splitting condition implies that B1 and B2 do not\nintersect; in particular, they bound a region U . We can now define the new\n(complete, infinite volume) cone-manifold Cl as\nCl = C1 \u222a U \u222a C2 / \u223c,\nwhere the boundaries \u2202Ci and Bi are identified; by construction, the meridian of the new edge is homotopic to \u03bd and its cone angle is equal to the one\nalong \u03bd.\nThis method also allows us to split C along a family of disjoint splittable\ncurves. More precisely, if \u03bd1 , . . . , \u03bdp are pairwise disjoint, non-homotopic\ncurves on N satisfying the splitting condition, then we can split C along\nthis family by proceeding as above: we first cut C along the C(\u03bdi ) (which\nonly intersect at the singular vertex), then glue parts of singular tubes between the pieces. By restricting this construction, we can apply it to a\n24\n\n\fS\n\nC\nC1\n\n\"\n\nC2\nC(\")\n\n2\n\nS#\n\nl\n\n\"'\n\nB1 =C(\"')\n\nT\n\nB2\n\nC'\nU\n\nC1\nB1 ~ ! C1\n\nC2\n\nB2 ~ !

If we replace \u03bd by an equivalent splittable curve in this construction, then it is clear that the resulting cone-manifolds are the same.\nHowever, replacing \u03bd by a homotopic but non-equivalent splittable curve\nwill yield a different splitting deformation Cl0 of C, even though the meridian of the new edge is still homotopic to \u03bd. The two families Cl and Cl0\nshould be thought as splitting C into opposite directions, and we will see\nthat they can be distinguished by their holonomy characters.\nMore general splitting deformations\nThe splitting condition that we introduce in section 3.1 is rather simple to\nformulate and to verify; however, it is not strictly necessary for the existence\nof splitting deformations. In fact, the above construction can be carried\nout for a slightly larger class of curves, either non-splittable or with trivial\nholonomy.\n\n25\n\n\fWe first consider the case of a non-peripheral, non-singular simple closed\ncurve \u03bd on the smooth part N of a spherical cone-surface S. The curve \u03bd\nseparates S into two parts S1 and S2 , and we want to construct the splitting\ndeformation of the hyperbolic cone C(S) by gluing a part of a singular tube\nbetween C1 = C(S1 ) and C2 = C(S2 ). We know that a neighbourhood\nof \u03bd can be isometrically immersed in the football S2\u03b1 ; we will furthermore\nassume that this immersion is an embedding.\nAs before, let \u03bd 0 be the image of \u03bd by this embedding, and let B1 be the\ncone over \u03bd 0 in T = C(S2\u03b1 ). The surface B2 is obtained as the image of B1\nby a hyperbolic translation of length l along the singular axis of T . Now B1\n(resp. B2 ) separates T into two half-spaces; let M1 (resp. M2 ) be the one\nlying in the negative (resp. positive) direction with respect to the direction\nof the hyperbolic translation above. Several cases can happen:\n\u2022 The two half-spaces M1 and M2 (and consequently also the two surfaces B1 and B2 ) do not intersect. This is the \"good\" case, happening\nin particular when \u03bd is splittable. Then we can proceed as before: B1\nand B2 bound a region U = T \\ (M1 \u222a M2 ), and the deformed conemanifold is constructed as C1 \u222a U \u222a C2 with boundaries identified.\n\u2022 The two half-spaces M1 and M2 intersect. Let U = T \\ (M1 \u222a M2 ) and\nW = M1 \u2229 M2 ; for the simplicity of the discussion we will assume that\nW is connected, but what follows can be applied to all the components\nof W . The boundary of W is composed of two parts, \u2202W1 \u2282 B1 and\n\u2202W2 \u2282 B2 . The isometry between neighbourhoods of \u03bd and \u03bd 0 yields\nan isometric embedding of a (conic) neighbourhood of B1 in M1 into\nC1 ; starting from a neighbourhood of \u2202W1 , we can try to extend this\nto an isometric embedding of W into C1 . We can proceed similarly\nfor embedding isometrically W into C2 . Here again, several cases can\nhappen:\n1. The region W can be embedded isometrically as W 0 in e.g. C2 .\nThen the deformed cone-manifold can be constructed as C1 \u222a\nU \u222a (C2 \\ W 0 ), with the consistent boundary identifications. This\ncase arises for instance when \u03bd could have been homotoped into\na splittable curve.\n2. The region W cannot be embedded in C1 or C2 , but can be embedded isometrically as W 0 in C2 \u222a U , where the boundaries \u2202C2\nand B2 are identified (the case is of course similar if W embeds\nisometrically in C1 \u222aU ). Then the deformed cone-manifold can be\nconstructed as C1 \u222a ((C2 \u222a U ) \\ W 0 ), with the consistent boundary\nidentifications. We give in Fig. 4 an example of this construction:\nin the top-left corner is represented a part of a spherical conesurface S with three of its cone points, and the (non-splittable)\n26\n\n\fM1\n\nS1\n\"\n\nS\n\nS2\n\nU\n\nB1\n!\nz\n\nT\n\nB2\nU\n\nW\nM2\n\nW'\n\nC2\n\nU\n\nU\n\nFigure 4: A generalized splitting deformation\nsimple closed curve \u03bd that separates it into S1 and S2 . The right\nside of the picture is a sketch of T and its various regions. If we\nuse cylindrical coordinates (r, z, \u03b8) in T (as in the introduction),\nthen this sketch should be thought as a slice {r = constant}; the\nfoliation given by ker d\u03b8 is vertical, and we see at once that \u03bd is\nnot splittable. The bottom-left corner depicts (a slice of) C2 \u222a U ,\nas well as W 0 , the isometric image of W . The darkest part of W 0\nlies in U and is also represented on the right.\n3. the region W cannot be embedded isometrically in C1 \u222a U or\nC2 \u222a U , for instance because such an embedding would encounter\na singular edge. Then the construction of the deformed conemanifold along these lines fails.\nThe case 2 is of course the most interesting: the curve \u03bd is then called\na generalized splittable curve. Fig. 5 shows an example where this situation arises. It represents a spherical cone-surface; the thick boundary edges\nshould be identified according to their labels. All the big triangles are equilateral and have angles 2\u03c0/5, so that the holonomy representation actually\nhas values in the icosahedron symmetry group. It has 5 cone points of cone\nangles \u03c0, 4\u03c0/3 (three times) and 8\u03c0/5. The cone angle along the simple\nclosed curve \u03bd depicted in the picture is 8\u03c0/5. The homotopy class of \u03bd is\nnot splittable; however, splitting deformations along this curve are possible,\naccording to the above construction.\nSplitting deformations can also be defined for curves with trivial holonomy (although they never can be part of an admissible pair-of-pants decomposition of \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 ). Let \u03bd be a non-peripheral, simple closed curve with\n27\n\n\fe\n\nd\n\ne\n\nd\n\na\nc\n\na\nc\nb\n\nb\n\nFigure 5: A generalized splittable curve\ntrivial holonomy on N . Let \u03bd\u0303 be a lift of \u03bd to the universal cover \u00d1 . Since\nthe curve \u03bd has trivial holonomy, the image of \u03bd\u0303 under the developing map\nis a closed curve on S2 . Now every point p of S2 defines polar coordinates\n(r, \u03b8) on S2 \\ {p, \u2212p}, and the 1-form d\u03b8 descends to a well-defined 1-form,\nstill denoted d\u03b8, in a neighbourhood of \u03bd (non-singular if the image of \u03bd\u0303\ndoes not intersect {p, \u2212p}). We can then proceed exactly as previously. In\nparticular, we can define a splitting condition for \u03bd by requiring that it is\ntransverse to such a 1-form d\u03b8 corresponding to some point p \u2208 S2R; similarly,\nthe cone angle along \u03bd with respect to d\u03b8 is simply defined as | \u03bd d\u03b8|, and\nis necessarily a multiple of 2\u03c0.\nA splitting deformation obtained in that way (provided that it can be\nconstructed, either because \u03bd is splittable or that the generalized construction works) depends obviously of the choice of p, and it is quite unclear\nwhether it can be extended to the whole of M . Note that if a new edge\ne has cone angle 2\u03c0, then the Riemannian metric is actually not singular\nalong e, and this \"removable edge\" can be included in the smooth part. This\noperation, however, changes the topological type of the smooth part, and\nthus does not fit well within our Def(M )-framework.\n\n3.3\n\nDeformations and the holonomy character\n\nThe splitting deformations of the singular tube U\u03b5 (\u03a3) that we have just\nconstructed are closely related to the complex Hamiltonian (twist) flows\nintroduced in section 2.1. Since U\u03b5 (\u03a3) retracts by deformation on \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 , they\nhave the same character variety, and a hyperbolic metric on the singular tube\n\n28\n\n\fyields a holonomy character \u03c7 \u2208 X(\u03c01 U\u03b5 (\u03a3), SL2 (C)) = X(\u03c01 \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 , SL2 (C)).\nLet \u03c70 = [\u03c10 ] be the character induced by the hyperbolic structure of the\ncone-manifold X.\nLemma 3.8. Let N be the smooth part of a link's vertex and let \u03bd be a splittable curve on N . There exists a sign s \u2208 {\u22121, 1} such that the deformation\nof U\u03b5 (\u03a3) obtained by splitting along \u03bd has holonomy character \u03c70 = \u03c6ist (\u03c70 ),\n\u0001\u22121/2\nwhere \u03c6 is the Hamiltonian flow associated to tr\u03bd , t = l 4 \u2212 tr\u03bd (\u03c70 )2\n,\nand l is the length of the new edge.\nProof. We begin with the construction of the sign s. Let d\u03b8 be the\nstandard 1-form along \u03bd. Up to a change of sign of \u03b8, we can assume that\nthe integral of d\u03b8 along \u03bd is positive (hence equal to the cone angle \u03b1 along\n\u03bd). The vector field \u2202/\u2202\u03b8 is a Killing vector field in a neighbourhood of \u03bd,\nand as such it corresponds to a parallel section \u03c3\u2202/\u2202\u03b8 of the sl2 (C)-bundle\nE\u03c10 . Up to conjugacy, we can assume that the restriction of \u03c10 to N has\nvalues in SU(2), and that the fibers of E\u03c10 over \u03bd\u0014are identified\n\u0015 with sl2 (C)\ni/2\n0\nin such a way that \u03c3\u2202/\u2202\u03b8 is the constant section\n. This implies\n0 \u2212i/2\nthe more precise statement that\n\u0015\n\u0014\nexp(i\u03b1/2)\n0\n,\n\u03c10 (\u03bd) = c\n0\nexp(\u2212i\u03b1/2)\nfor a sign c \u2208 {\u22121, 1} (this sign depends of the choice of a lifting from\nIsom+ (H3 ) ' PSL2 (C) to SL2 (C)). Since the holonomy of \u03bd is not trivial,\n\u03b1 6= 0 mod 2\u03c0, and we can let\ns = \u2212c sign(sin(\u03b1/2));\nit is equal to minus the sign of the imaginary part of the first diagonal\ncoefficient of \u03c10 (\u03bd), once the section \u03c3\u2202/\u2202\u03b8 is correctly identified. (Note that\nthis identification is only necessary when \u03b1 = \u03c0 mod 2\u03c0; otherwise it is\nsufficient to require that \u03c10 (\u03bd) has the above expression.)\nThe curve \u03bd separates N in two subsurfaces; let N1 be the one lying to\nthe left of \u03bd, and N2 the other one. We can choose a representative \u03c10 of \u03c70\n0\nsuch that the restrictions of \u03c10 and\n\u0014 \u03c1 to N1 coincide (and\n\u0015 in particular have\nexp(l/2)\n0\nvalues in SU(2)). Now let \u03b6 =\n; this is a hyperbolic\n0\nexp(\u2212l/2)\nisometry of translation length l. Then it is easy to check that on \u03c01 (N1 \u222aN2 ),\n\u03c10 and \u03c10 are related by the formula\n\u001a\n\u03c10 (\u03b3)\n: \u03b3 \u2208 \u03c01 N1\n0\n\u03c1 (\u03b3) =\n\u22121\n\u03b6\u03c10 (\u03b3)\u03b6\n: \u03b3 \u2208 \u03c01 N2\nThis expression matches the description of the complex twist flow from section 2.1. More precisely, if \u03c8 denotes the complex twist flow associated\n29\n\n\fto the function tr\u03bd , then \u03c10 is equal to \u03c8z (\u03c10 ) for any z such that \u03b6 =\n\u00b1 exp(zF (\u03c10 (\u03bd))), which is equivalent to exp(l/2) = \u00b1 exp(izc sin(\u03b1/2)).\nAll such values of z have the same imaginary part, and a solution is given\nby\np\nz = \u2212icl(2 sin(\u03b1/2))\u22121 = isl(2 1 \u2212 cos(\u03b1/2))\u22121 = isl(4 \u2212 tr\u03bd (\u03c70 ))\u22121/2 .\nIn particular, if we let t = l(4 \u2212 tr\u03bd (\u03c70 ))\u22121/2 , we obtain that the diffeomorphism \u03c6ist associated to the Hamiltonian flow of tr\u03bd maps \u03c70 to \u03c70 .\n\u001e\nRemark 3.9. We have seen that there can exist on N a splittable curve\n\u03bd 0 , homotopic but not equivalent to \u03bd. Then one can check that the signs\nassociated to \u03bd and \u03bd 0 are opposite, so that in terms of holonomy, splitting\nalong \u03bd or along \u03bd 0 corresponds to following the Hamiltonian flow \u03c6it in two\ndifferent directions.\nWe can now deal with the remaining deformations of U\u03b5 (\u03a3), and relate\nthem to the action-angle coordinates introduced in section 2.2. The following\nproposition is the main result of this section:\nProposition 3.10.\n~ be the meridian set of U\u03b5 (\u03a3), and let ~\u03bd be a fam` Let \u03bc\nily of curves on j Nj such that the family C = \u03bc\n~ \u222a ~\u03bd is up to homotopy\nan admissible pair-of-pants decomposition of \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 . In particular, the map\n(tr\u03bc~ , tr~\u03bd , \u03c4\u03bc~ , \u03c4~\u03bd ) is a system of local coordinates on Xirr (\u03c01 \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 , SL2 (C)). Let\n\u03c70 be a character close to \u03c70 , such that (tr\u03bc~ (\u03c70 ), tr~\u03bd (\u03c70 )) \u2208 (\u22122, 2)3g\u22123 . Assume furthermore that the curves in ~\u03bd for which Im \u03c4\u03bdi (\u03c70 ) 6= 0 are splittable,\ndisjoint, and with associated signs si such that si Im \u03c4\u03bdi (\u03c70 ) > 0. Then there\nexists a deformation of U\u03b5 (\u03a3), whose holonomy character is precisely \u03c70 .\nProof. We begin by constructing a deformation U 0 of U\u03b5 (\u03a3) whose\nholonomy character \u03c700 satisfies (tr\u03bc~ , tr~\u03bd )(\u03c700 ) = (tr\u03bc~ , tr~\u03bd )(\u03c70 ), \u03c4\u03bc~ (\u03c700 ) = 0,\nand \u03c4~\u03bd (\u03c700 ) = Re(\u03c4~\u03bd (\u03c70 )). Due to our choice of action-angle coordinates,\nthis means that the restriction to any vertex's link Nj of a representative\n\u03c100 of \u03c700 has values in a maximal compact subgroup of SL2 (C); this is of\ncourse also true for \u03c10 . In particular, we can consider the restrictions of\n\u03c70 and \u03c700 as elements of X(\u03c01 Nj , SU(2)). Now the local homeomorphism\n(akin to (1.1)) between the space Def(Nj ) of spherical structures on Nj and\nX(\u03c01 Nj , SU(2)) means that we can deform the link Lj into a spherical conesurface L0j whose holonomy character is given by \u03c700 . Taking the hyperbolic\ncone over L0j , we obtain the corresponding deformation of a neighbourhood\nof vj , and then the deformation U 0 of U\u03b5 (\u03a3) associated to \u03c700 . A second,\neasy step is to construct a deformation U 00 whose holonomy character \u03c7000\nis such that (tr\u03bc~ , tr~\u03bd , \u03c4\u03bc~ , \u03c4~\u03bd )(\u03c7000 ) = (tr\u03bc~ (\u03c70 ), tr~\u03bd (\u03c70 ), \u03c4\u03bc~ (\u03c70 ), Re(\u03c4~\u03bd (\u03c70 )). For\nthis, all we have to do is to change the lengths and/or twist parameters of\nthe existing edges, see [MM2] section 3 for more details.\n30\n\n\fIf \u03c70 and\u03c70 are sufficiently close, Lemma 3.2 implies that the curves \u03bdi\nfor which Im \u03c4\u03bdi (\u03c70 ) 6= 0 are still splittable and disjoint in U 00 ; furthermore, it is easy to check that the associated signs si given by Lemma\n3.8 are preserved if the deformation is small enough. We can thus apply the splitting deformations described above simultaneously to all the\ncurves \u03bdi forpwhich Im \u03c4\u03bdi (\u03c70 ) 6= 0, inserting new edges of lengths li =\nsi Im(\u03c4\u03bdi (\u03c70 )) 4 \u2212 tr\u03bdi (\u03c70 )2 . Lemma 3.8 then shows that the resulting deformation of U\u03b5 (\u03a3) has the correct holonomy character \u03c70 .\n\u001e\nThe above proposition shows the existence of the deformation for the\ncharacter \u03c70 , but not the uniqueness. Actually, in the correspondence (1.1),\nthe deformation of the hyperbolic structure on U\u03b5 (\u03a3) corresponding to a\ncharacter close to \u03c70 is unique only up to the relation induced by thickening\n(and isotopy), see [CHK]. So \u03c70 determines the hyperbolic metric only in\na compact core, and it can happen that this metric admits different completions as a deformation of the cone-manifold structure on U\u03b5 (\u03a3). The\nfollowing definition lifts this ambiguity:\nDefinition 3.11. A deformation of the hyperbolic cone-manifold structure\non U\u03b5 (\u03a3) is called ~\u03bd -compatible if it is obtained as a sequence of deformations\nas in the proof of Proposition 3.10.\nNote that by construction, a ~\u03bd -compatible deformation is not split along\nany non-splittable curve; furthermore if ~\u03bd contains two non-disjoint curves\nthen the deformation is split along only one of them.\n\n4\n\nThe local shape of the deformation space\n\nHaving completed our study of the deformations of the singular tube, we\nnow turn to the deformations of cone-manifolds. We actually limit ourselves\nto compatible deformations, as defined below. Using the results of sections\n2 and 3, this enables us to determine the possible deformations of the holonomy representation and of the geometric structure in a neighbourhood of\nthe singular locus. With these two ingredients we can then proceed to prove\nour main results (Theorems 4.3 and 1.2). As an application of these results,\nwe explain the structure of the deformation space of X and detail what\nhappens for doubles of polyhedra.\n\n4.1\n\nCompatible cone-manifold structures\n\nWe classify the deformations of X according to the deformations they induce\non the singular tube U\u03b5 (\u03a3).\nDefinition 4.1.\n~ be the meridian set of X, and let ~\u03bd be a family\n` Let \u03bc\nof curves on j Nj such that the family C = \u03bc\n~ \u222a ~\u03bd is up to homotopy an\n31\n\n\fadmissible pair-of-pants decomposition of \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 . A deformation of the hyperbolic cone-manifold structure on X is called ~\u03bd -compatible if its restriction to\nU\u03b5 (\u03a3) is ~\u03bd -compatible. We denote by C\u22121 (X, ~\u03bd ) be the space of ~\u03bd -compatible\ndeformations of X.\nWe identify an element in C\u22121 (X, ~\u03bd ) with the corresponding deformation\nof the smooth part, i.e. with an element in Def(M ). Hence we may topologize\nC\u22121 (X, ~\u03bd ) as a subset of Def(M ).\nIf X has cone angles less than 2\u03c0, then C defines a local coordinate\nsystem on Xirr (\u03c01 M, SL2 (C)) near the holonomy character \u03c70 = [hol] of X.\nThis coordinate system is given by Theorem 2.11, which asserts that the\nmap\n\u03a6C : U \u2229 Xirr (\u03c01 M, SL2 (C)) \u2192 CN \u00d7 R3g\u22123\u2212N \u00d7 R3g\u22123\u2212N\n\u03c7 7\u2192 (tr\u03bc~ (\u03c7), Im \u03c4~\u03bd (\u03c7), Im tr~\u03bd (\u03c7))\nis a local diffeomorphism at \u03c70 . Since via (1.1) the deformation space\nDef(M ) is locally homeomorphic to the character variety Xirr (\u03c01 M, SL2 (C)),\nwe also obtain in this way a local coordinate chart on Def(M ). There is of\ncourse a connection between this coordinate map \u03a6C and the subspace of\n~\u03bd -compatible deformations of X. By definition of the action-angle coordinates, we know that \u03a6C (\u03c70 ) \u2208 (\u22122, 2)N \u00d7 {0}6g\u22126\u22122N . Now if a character\n\u03c70 \u2208 U corresponds to an element X 0 \u2208 C\u22121 (X, ~\u03bd ), then every curve in C\nis either homotopic to the the meridian of an edge or is up to homotopy\ncontained in the link of a vertex of X 0 ; in any case, its holonomy is elliptic. This means that \u03a6C restricted to U \u2229 C\u22121 (X, ~\u03bd ) actually has values\nin (\u22122, 2)N \u00d7 R3g\u22123\u2212N \u00d7 {0}3g\u22123\u2212N . Using Lemma 3.8, we can actually\nbe more precise, since we know that Im \u03c4~\u03bdi (\u03c70 ) must have sign si if \u03bdi is\nsplittable, and vanish otherwise.\nIn the same lemma, we have also seen a formula for the length of a new\nedge:\nq\n`i = si Im \u03c4\u03bdi (\u03c70 )\n\n4 \u2212 tr\u03bdi (\u03c70 )2 .\n\nThis suggests that on C\u22121 (X, ~\u03bd ), we can use more geometrically meaningful\ncoordinates. For simplicity, we assume that the family ~\u03bd is sorted so that\nthe curves \u03bd1 to \u03bdn1 are splittable and the others are not. Let Rns 1 be the\nsubset of tuples (x1 , . . . , xn1 ) such that si xi \u2265 0. Now for each curve \u03bci \u2208 \u03bc\n~,\nthere exists a sign ci \u2208 {\u22121, 1} such that tr\u03bci (\u03c70 ) = 2ci cos(\u03b1i /2) (this is\nthe same definition as in the proof of Lemma 3.8). Let fi (x) = 2ci cos(x/2);\nit is a diffeomorphism from (0, 2\u03c0) to (\u22122, 2), and fi (\u03b1i ) = tr\u03bci (\u03c70 ).\nProposition 4.2. Let E~\u03bd \u2282 U denote the submanifold-with-corners\nN\nn1\n3g\u22123\u2212N \u2212n1\n\u03a6\u22121\n\u00d7 {0}3g\u22123\u2212N ).\nC (V \u2229 (\u22122, 2) \u00d7 Rs \u00d7 {0}\n1\nThen the map \u03a8~\u03bd : E~\u03bd \u2192 (0, 2\u03c0)N \u00d7 Rn\u22650\n,\n\n32\n\n\f\u0010\np\n\u22121\n\u03a8~\u03bd (\u03c7) = f1\u22121 (tr\u03bc1 (\u03c7)), . . . , fN\n(tr\u03bcN (\u03c7)), s1 Im \u03c4\u03bd1 (\u03c7) 4 \u2212 tr\u03bd1 (\u03c7)2 ,\nq\n\u0011\n. . . , sn1 Im \u03c4\u03bdn1 (\u03c7) 4 \u2212 tr\u03bdn1 (\u03c7)2 ,\nis a local diffeomorphism. Moreover, if \u03c70 is the holonomy character of a\ncone-manifold structure X 0 \u2208 C\u22121 (X, ~\u03bd ) close to X, then\n0\n\u03a8~\u03bd (\u03c70 ) = (\u03b110 , . . . , \u03b1N\n, `1 , . . . , `n1 ),\n\nwhere (\u03b1i0 )1\u2264i\u2264N are the cone angles of the original edges and (`i )1\u2264i\u2264n1 are\nthe lengths of the new edges.\nProof. It follows directly from the preceding discussion and the fact that\nthe map \u03a6C is a local diffeomorphism (Theorem 2.11).\n\u001e\n\n4.2\n\nDeformations of hyperbolic cone-3-manifolds\n\n1\nWe have just seen that the local diffeomorphism \u03a8~\u03bd : E~\u03bd \u2192 (0, 2\u03c0)N \u00d7 Rn\u22650\ninduces on C\u22121 (X, ~\u03bd ) a locally injective map, that sends an element to the\nvector composed of the cone angles of the original edges and the lengths\nof the new ones. As a final step, we now show that assuming the splitting\ncondition, this map is locally onto, or equivalently that C\u22121 (X, ~\u03bd ) can be\nlocally identified with E~\u03bd .\n\nTheorem 4.3. Let X be a hyperbolic cone-3-manifold with meridian set \u03bc\n~\nand`\ncone angles \u03b1 = (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1N ) \u2208 (0, 2\u03c0)N . Let ~\u03bd be a family of curves\n~ \u222a ~\u03bd is up to homotopy an admissible pairon kj=1 Nj such that C = \u03bc\nof-pants decomposition of \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 . Then the ~\u03bd -compatible deformation of the\nhyperbolic cone-manifold structure on X corresponding to a vector (\u03b10 , `) \u2208\n(0, 2\u03c0)N \u00d7 R3g\u22123\u2212N\nclose to (\u03b1, 0) exists, if the curves \u03bdi with `i > 0 are\n\u22650\nsplittable and disjoint.\n0\nProof. Using Proposition 4.2, we know the candidate \u03c70 = \u03a8~\u22121\n\u03bd (\u03b1 , `) for\n0\nthe conjugacy class of the holonomy representation of X . Since Def(M ) is\nlocally homeomorphic to X(\u03c01 M, SL2 (C)), we know that \u03c70 is the holonomy\ncharacter of a neighbouring hyperbolic structure on M . What we need\nto show is that this hyperbolic structure (or a thickening thereof) can be\ncompleted into a cone-manifold X 0 \u2208 C\u22121 (X, ~\u03bd ), i.e. such that its singular\nlocus \u03a30 is obtained from \u03a3 by splitting some vertices according to the curves\nof ~\u03bd .\nBy abuse of notation, the restriction of \u03c70 to X(\u03c01 \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 , SL2 (C)) will\nstill be denoted \u03c70 . Similarly, \u03c70 stands for both the conjugacy class of the\nholonomy representation hol of X and its restriction. Using Proposition\n3.10, and the fact that the curve \u03bdi satisfies the splitting condition and are\ndisjoint whenever `i is positive, we can continuously deform the hyperbolic\n\n33\n\n\fstructure on U\u03b5 (\u03a3) into a ~\u03bd -compatible one whose holonomy representation\nis given by \u03c70 .\nLet us now recall briefly some elements of the theory of deformations of\nhyperbolic structure, see [Gol3] for more details. We know that a hyperbolic\nstructure on M is determined by its developing map dev : M\u0303 \u2192 H3 and its\nholonomy representation \u03c1 : \u03c01 M \u2192 SL2 (C). On M\u0303 , we can consider the\ntrivial bundle \u1ebc = M\u0303 \u00d7 H3 , which admits a horizontal foliation F given by\nthe constant sections. The developing map then gives rise to a section \u03c3\u0303 of\n\u1ebc, mapping p \u2208 M\u0303 to (p, dev(p)); this developing section is transverse to F.\nWe can quotient \u1ebc = M\u0303 \u00d7 H3 by the action of the fundamental group of M\ngiven by the holonomy representation: (p, x) \u223c (\u03b3.p, \u03c1(\u03b3)(x)). The result is\na bundle E\u03c1 on M , with fiber H3 , still endowed with the horizontal foliation\ninherited from F. The equivariance of the developing map means that the\nsection \u03c3\u0303 descends to the developing section \u03c3 of E\u03c1 , transverse to F. What\nwe have described here is a construction that to a hyperbolic structure on M\nassociates a triplet (E, F, \u03c3) where E is a (H3 , SL2 (C))-bundle on M with a\nhorizontal foliation F and a section \u03c3 transverse to this foliation. One can\nthen show that any such triplet actually determines a hyperbolic structure\non M .\nNow let \u03c10 be a representative of \u03c70 close to hol. Then the corresponding bundles E\u03c10 and Ehol are actually isomorphic, so we can identify them:\nE\u03c10 ' Ehol ' E. The two horizontal foliations F and F 0 are however different but close. We have seen that using the results of the previous section, we\ncan construct on a neighbourhood U\u03b5 (\u03a3) of the singular locus of X a continuous family of hyperbolic structures, joining the initial structure to one whose\nholonomy representation is induced by \u03c10 ; this means that over U\u03b5 (\u03a3), the\nfoliation F 0 is still transverse to \u03c3. By compactness, this is also true over the\nremainder of M if \u03c10 is close enough to hol, i.e. if (\u03b10 \u2212 \u03b1, `) is small enough.\nThis implies that the triplet (E, F 0 , \u03c3) determines a hyperbolic structure\non M , whose restriction to U\u03b5 (\u03a3) is the deformation constructed above. In\nparticular, the metric completion of M is the desired cone-manifold.\n\u001e\nRemark 4.4. It should be noted that the splitting assumption on the curves\n\u03bdi for which `i 6= 0 is not indispensable; actually, the only necessary condition\nis that the correct deformation on U\u03b5 (\u03a3) can be constructed. In particular,\nwe can include generalized splittable curves, as described in the last part of\nsection 3.2.\nFrom this result, our main theorem follows easily. It also supposes the\nsplitting condition, since it is easier to state, but the reader should be aware\nthat it applies to a slightly more general situation.\nTheorem 1.2. Let X be a hyperbolic cone-3-manifold with cone angles\nless than 2\u03c0 and meridian set \u03bc\n~ . Let ~\u03bd be a pair-of-pants decomposition of\n34\n\n\f`k\n\nsuch that C = \u03bc\n~ \u222a~\u03bd gives an admissible pair-of-pants decomposition\nof \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 . If all the curves in ~\u03bd are splittable, then the map\nj=1 Nj\n\n3g\u22123\u2212N\n(\u03b1, `) : C\u22121 (X, ~\u03bd ) \u2192 (0, 2\u03c0)N \u00d7 R\u22650\n\nsending a ~\u03bd -compatible cone-manifold structure to the vector composed of its\noriginal edges' cone angles and new edges' lengths, is a local homeomorphism\nat the given structure.\nProof. This follows directly from Proposition 4.2 and Theorem 4.3.\n\n4.3\n\n\u001e\n\nStratified structure of C\u22121 (X)\n\nLet X be a closed hyperbolic cone-3-manifold with all cone angles smaller\nthan 2\u03c0; we denote as usual its regular part by M and its meridian set\nby \u03bc\n~ . Its deformation space C\u22121 (X) is defined as the space of all hyperbolic cone-manifold structures on the same underlying topological space\n(but possibly with different singular loci)\nS and with the same regular part\nM . Let C\u22121 (X)comp be the union\nC\u22121 (X, ~\u03bd ) over all the families ~\u03bd\nsuch that \u03bc\n~ \u222a ~\u03bd is an admissible pair-of-pants decomposition (note that\nC\u22121 (X, ~\u03bd ) = C\u22121 (X, ~\u03bd 0 ) if each splittable curve of ~\u03bd is equivalent to a splittable curve of ~\u03bd 0 and reciprocally). This space of compatible deformations\ncontains a large piece of the neighbourhood of X in C\u22121 (X). Theorems 4.3\nand\nS 1.2 give a description of the shape of C\u22121 (X)comp , and its expression as\nC\u22121 (X, ~\u03bd ) shows that it is a stratified space near X:\n\u2022 The (closed) top-dimensional strata have dimension 3g \u2212 3 and correspond to the C\u22121 (X, ~\u03bd )-spaces for which all the curves in ~\u03bd are splittable and disjoint. In these strata, we have the local parametrization\n3g\u22123\u2212N\n(\u03b1, `) : C\u22121 (X, ~\u03bd ) \u2192 (0, 2\u03c0)N \u00d7 R\u22650\ngiven by Theorem 1.2.\n\u2022 We can\nstratum to each family of curves\n` associate a lower-dimensional\n~\u03bd 0 \u2208 Nj such that \u03bc\n~ \u222a ~\u03bd 0 is a subset of an admissible pair-of-pants\ndecomposition of \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 , and such that the curves in ~\u03bd 0 are splittable and\ndisjoint. This (closed) stratum then consists of the deformations that\nare only split along the curves of ~\u03bd 0 , and it also admits a parametrization by the cone angles of the original edges and the lengths\nof the\nT\nnew ones. An alternate description is as the intersection C\u22121 (X, ~\u03bd )\nover all the family of curves ~\u03bd containing ~\u03bd 0 and such that \u03bc\n~ \u222a ~\u03bd is\nadmissible; note however that not all of the C\u22121 (X, ~\u03bd )-spaces in this\nintersection correspond to top-dimensional strata. Indeed, it is even\npossible that ~\u03bd 0 cannot be completed by any disjoint, non-homotopic\nsplittable curve, in which case the corresponding stratum does not lie\nin any higher-dimensional one.\n\n35\n\n\f\u2022 At the intersection of all these C\u22121 (X, ~\u03bd )-spaces we find of course\nthe bottom-dimensional stratum C\u22121 (X, \u03a3), consisting of the deformations that do not split any vertex.\nLocally, C\u22121 (X) can contain other types of deformation, besides the\nobvious extension of the above description to include generalized splittable\ncurves. First of all, as we have seen in section 3.2, it may be possible to split\nX along curves with trivial holonomy. However, the parametrization results\nare no longer valid in that case. Secondly, a curve \u03b3 on a link's smooth part\nNj may be \"weakly splittable\", if Nj lies on the boundary of the open set of\nspherical structures for which \u03b3 is splittable (cf. Lemma 3.2). In that case,\neven though X cannot be directly split along \u03b3, it can happen that arbitrarily\nsmall deformations of it admit such splittings. The resulting elements of\nC\u22121 (X) then do not form a well-defined stratum. The fifth picture on Fig. 2\nprovides an example of a weakly splittable curve: under small perturbations\nof the spherical structure, it can become splittable; the resulting cone angle\nis either close to 3\u03c0 or to 5\u03c0, and these two possibilities correspond to\ndifferent signs for the direction of the Hamiltonian flow, cf. Lemma 3.8.\nA complex of curves realization\nThe local stratified structure on C\u22121 (X)\n`comp is in fact closely related to the\ngeometry of the complex of curves of Nj . We recall briefly its definition\n[Har, MM1]: the complex of curves K(S) of a surface S is the simplicial complex whose n-dimensional simplices correspond to sets of n + 1 homotopy\nclasses of non-peripheral simple closed curves on S, realizable as disjoint\ncurves. In particular, its top-dimensional simplices (or facets) are in bijection with the pair-of-pants decompositions`of S. Note that the inclusion of\n`\nNj in \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 induces an embedding of K( Nj ) into K(\u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 ) as the link of\nthe simplex K\u03bc~ corresponding to the family of meridians of X.\nEvery stratum of C\u22121 (X)comp is determined\nby a family of curves ~\u03bd 0 , and\n`\nthus corresponds to a simplex K~\u03bd 0 in K( Nj ). But this\n` correspondence is\nnot one-to-one: we have seen that there can exist on Nj two homotopic,\nnon-equivalent splittable curves; splitting deformations along one curve and\nalong the other belong to two disjoint strata of C\u22121 (X)comp , that both correspond to the same simplex of\n`the curve complex. Besides, most families of\ndisjoint homotopy classes on Nj cannot be realized by splittable curves.\nHowever, we can still use the results of this article to construct a geo0\nmetric\n` realization of a modified curve complex. Let K be the subcomplex of\nK( `\nNj ) obtained by removing all faces whose family of homotopy classes\ncuts Nj into subsurfaces at least one of which has reducible holonomy representation, and also all faces whose family of homotopy classes contains one\nwith trivial holonomy (since it obviously cannot be completed into an admissible pair-of-pants decomposition). Otherwise, Proposition 2.4 asserts that\n36\n\n\fany remaining simplex is included in a facet, i.e.\n` a (3g \u2212 4 \u2212 N )-dimensional\none. Note however that generically K 0 = K( Nj ) and this restriction is\nunnecessary. We consider the cone C(K 0 ) over K 0 ; it is not a simplicial\ncomplex, but its truncated version carries this structure. Now let us choose\n`\nan arbitrary function s which associates to each homotopy class [\u03b3] on Nj\na sign s([\u03b3]) \u2208 {\u22121, 1}. We will see that any choice of such a function yields\na continuous map \u039es from a neighbourhood V of (\u03b1, 0) in (0, 2\u03c0)N \u00d7 C(K 0 )\nloc\n\nto Def(M ) ' X(\u03c01 M, SL2 (C)), where \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 2\u03c0)N is the vector of the cone\nangles of X.\nEvery top-dimensional simplex of K 0 determines (up to homotopy) a\nfamily of curves ~\u03bd such that C = \u03bc\n~ \u222a~\u03bd is an admissible pair-of-pants decomposition of \u2202 M\u0304\u03b5 . This simplex K~\u03bd0 can be parametrized as {(x1 , . . . , x3g\u22123\u2212N ) \u2208\nP\nR3g\u22123\u2212N\n:\nj xj = 1}, where the subset {xi = 1} is the vertex associated\n\u22650\nto the single curve \u03bdi . By Theorem 2.11, C gives rise to a local coordinate\nchart \u03a6C on X(\u03c01 M, SL2 (C)), and as in Proposition 4.2, we can consider\n3g\u22123\u2212N\nN\n\u00d7 {0}3g\u22123\u2212N ) \u2192\nthe local diffeomorphism \u03a8~\u03bd ,s : \u03a6\u22121\nC ((\u22122, 2) \u00d7 Rs\n(0, 2\u03c0)N \u00d7 R3g\u22123\u2212N\n,\n\u22650\n\u0010\np\n\u22121\n(tr\u03bcN (\u03c7)), s([\u03bd1 ]) Im \u03c4\u03bd1 (\u03c7) 4 \u2212 tr\u03bd1 (\u03c7)2 ,\n\u03a8~\u03bd ,s (\u03c7) = f1\u22121 (tr\u03bc1 (\u03c7)), . . . , fN\nq\n\u0011\n. . . , s([\u03bd3g\u22123\u2212N ]) Im \u03c4\u03bd3g\u22123\u2212N (\u03c7) 4 \u2212 tr\u03bd3g\u22123\u2212N (\u03c7)2 .\n\u0001\nLet V~\u03bd = V \u2229 (0, 2\u03c0)N \u00d7 C(K~\u03bd0 ) . We can now define the continuous map\n\u039es by requiring that its restriction to V~\u03bd is given by\n\u039e~\u03bd ,s : V~\u03bd \u2282 (0, 2\u03c0)N \u00d7 K~\u03bd0 \u00d7 (0, \u221e) \u2192 X(\u03c01 M, SL2 (C))\n0\n0\n0\n(\u03b110 , . . . , \u03b1N\n, x1 , . . . , x3g\u22123\u2212N , t) 7\u2192 \u03a8~\u22121\n\u03bd ,s (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1N , tx1 , . . . , tx3g\u22123\u2212N )\n\nIt is then easy to check that these restrictions coincide on V~\u03bd \u2229 V\u03bd~0 as soon\nas it is non-empty. We remark that this map cannot be proper, because K 0\nis locally infinite whereas Def(M ) is locally compact.\nThere is an obvious relation between this map \u039es and the stratified\nstructure on C\u22121 (X)comp . Indeed, the holonomy characters of the elements\nof C\u22121 (X, ~\u03bd ) correspond to the image by \u039es of (0, 2\u03c0)N \u00d7 C(K~\u03bd0 ), as soon as\nthe function s maps the curves in ~\u03bd to their signs as defined in Lemma 3.8.\nThe non-properness of \u039es then corresponds to the existence of converging\nsequences of representations, as discussed below.\nLimit points\nIt is remarkable that the stratified structure of C\u22121 (X)comp is not locally\nfinite. Indeed, we have seen in section 3.1 an example with infinitely many\nnon-homotopic splittable curves. It implies that we can have infinitely many\ndifferent strata intersecting at a lower-dimensional one. However, C\u22121 (X)\n37\n\n\f!\n\nS\n\n$\n\n~\n\nn Dehn twists\n\nn#\"\n\nxn\n\nFigure 6: Converging deformations\nis immersed in Def(M ), which is locally compact; this means that in this\nsituation, there must exist a sequence of holonomy characters converging to\na limit.\nAn exact computation can be done in the example of section 3.1. We\nrecall that S is the double of a spherical square with angle 2\u03c0/3 (see Fig. 6).\nWe have seen that the image \u03bdn of the curve \u03bd after n (full) Dehn twists along\nthe curve \u03b3 satisfies the splitting condition and has cone angle 2n\u03c0+4\u03c0/3 if n\nis even, and 2n\u03c0 +2\u03c0/3 if n is odd. Let \u03c1n be the representation obtained by\nsplitting S along \u03bdn by a length of l/n for some positive real number l. Then\none can compute that this sequence of representations converges to a limit\nrepresentation \u03c1\u221e , which is \u221aexactly the representation obtained by splitting\nS along \u03b3 by a length of 23 l. This result is more striking expressed in\nterms of the complex Hamiltonian flow: the sequence of characters obtained\nfrom [\u03c1] by following the flow associated to tr\u03bdn for a complex time z/n,\nconverges to the character obtained by following the flow associated to tr\u03b3\nfor a complex time z. This means that in some sense, after a large number\nof Dehn twists along \u03b3, the curve \u03bdn becomes equivalent to n copies of \u03b3\nitself.\n\n4.4\n\nThe polyhedral case\n\nIf P is a convex hyperbolic polyhedron, then its double D(P ) has a natural cone-manifold structure with cone angles smaller than 2\u03c0, so the results\nof this article can be applied to D(P ). However for most splittings of the\nvertices, the resulting cone-manifold will no longer be the double of a polyhedron; this contrasts strongly with the non-splitting case, see [Mon].\n38\n\n\fFor simplicity we will work with face-marked polyhedra, that is, polyhedra equipped with a bijective map from the set of faces F to {1, 2, . . . , |F |}.\nLet P ol(n) be the set of strictly convex, face-marked, hyperbolic polyhedra with n faces. Each element of this set can be defined as a (nonredundant) intersection of n half-spaces. Using the correspondence between oriented half-spaces of H3 and points of the de Sitter space dS 3 ,\nwe see that P ol(n) can be identified with an open subset of (dS 3 )n ; in\nparticular, it is a smooth manifold of dimension 3n. The isometry group\nIsom+ (H3 ) = Isom+ (dS 3 ) = SO0 (1, 3) acts freely and discontinuously on\nthis set, so that the quotient P ol(n), the space of congruence classes of\n(face-marked) strictly convex hyperbolic polyhedra with n faces, is a smooth\nmanifold\nPk of dimension 3n \u2212 6. Using the Euler formula and the equality\n2N = j=1 mj (recall that N is the number of edges, k the number of vertices, and mj the valence of the j-th vertex), we obtain that the dimension\nP\nof P ol(n) is also equal to N + kj=1 (mj \u2212 3) = 3g \u2212 3. This is exactly\nthe dimension of C\u22121 (D(P ), ~\u03bd ), for any family of curves ~\u03bd satisfying the\nassumptions of Theorem 1.2.\nIn a neighbourhood of D(P ), the double construction embeds naturally\nP ol(n) into C\u22121 (D(P )), but as a union of several C\u22121 (D(P ), ~\u03bd )-spaces. Actually, it is rather simple to determine which families of curves ~\u03bd yield deformations that are double of polyhedra. The link of each vertex of D(P )\nis the double of a convex spherical polygon, and the splitting curves must\npreserve this double structure. Thus C\u22121 (D(P ), ~\u03bd ) corresponds to polyhedral deformations if and only if each curve \u03bdi in ~\u03bd is the double of an arc\njoining two non-adjacent edges of one of those spherical polygons. It is easy\nto see that such curves \u03bdi satisfy the splitting condition and give admissible pair-of-pants decompositions. Theorem 1.2 then yields, for each such\n~\u03bd , a parametrization by the dihedral angles and new edges' lengths of the\ncorresponding subset of P ol(n) in a neighbourhood of D(P ).\nWe give in Fig. 7 a schematic picture of P ol(n) near D(P ) for a polyhedron P having one vertex of valence 5 and all others of valence 3 (e.g. a\npyramid with a pentagonal base). The deformations modifying the dihedral angles are not depicted, but should be thought as an N -dimensional\nspace perpendicular to the plane of the figure. Locally, P ol(n) is the smooth\nunion of five C\u22121 (D(P ), ~\u03bd )-spaces, corresponding to the five different ways\nof splitting the spherical pentagon whose double is the spherical link of the\nvalence 5 vertex. Any other pair-of-pants decomposition of this spherical\nlink (satisfying the assumptions of Theorem 1.2) will yield deformations of\nD(P ) that are no longer double of polyhedra.\n\n39\n\n\fFigure 7: Partition of P ol(n) corresponding to all the possible splittings of\na valence 5 vertex.\n\n40\n\n\fReferences\n[AB]\n\nMichael F.
