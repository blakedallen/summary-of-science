The magnetic field dependence of the magnetisation (M ) and the temperature\ndependence of the ac susceptibility (\u03c7\u2032 = dM/dH) of CePd1\u2212x Rhx single crystals with\n0.80 \u2264 x \u2264 0.86 are analysed within the frame of the quantum Griffiths phase scenario, which\npredicts M \u221d H \u03bb and \u03c7\u2032 \u221d T \u03bb\u22121 with 0 \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 1. All M vs H and \u03c7\u2032 vs T data follow the\npredicted power-law behaviour. The parameter \u03bb, extracted from \u03c7\u2032 (T ), is very sensitive to the\nRh content x and varies systematically with x from -0.1 to 0.4. The value of \u03bb, derived from\nM (H) measurements on a CePd0.2 Rh0.8 single crystal, seems to be rather constant, \u03bb \u2248 0.2, in\na broad range of temperatures between 0.05 and 2 K and fields up to about 10 T. All observed\nsignatures and the \u03bb values are thus compatible with the quantum Griffiths scenario.\n\n1. Introduction\nCe- and Yb-based f -electron Kondo-lattice (KL) systems have shown the most drastic forms\nof non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) behaviour [1]. In these heavy-fermion (HF) materials, the ground\nstate sensitively depends on the balance between two competing interactions, which are both\ndetermined by the strength of the 4f -conduction electron hybridisation J: Whereas the Kondo\ninteraction leads to a screening of the local moments below a Kondo temperature TK , resulting\nin a paramagnetic (PM) ground state with itinerant 4f -electrons, the indirect exchange coupling\n(RKKY interaction) can mediate long-range magnetic ordering [2].\nOne of the explanations for such NFL phenomena is the presence of a quantum critical point\n(QCP) at a particular Jc : If the transition temperature TM of the long-range magnetic order\nis continuously shifted to zero by an external parameter x(J), e.g. pressure, magnetic field or\nchemical substitution, a 2nd order quantum phase transition (QPT) takes place at xc (Jc ) and\nT = 0, to which a QCP is associated. Here, the typical length and time scales of order parameter\nfluctuations diverge when approaching the transition point. These fluctuations are believed to\nbe responsible for the observed NFL corrections to the FL prediction for the heat capacity\nC/T (T ) = const., magnetic susceptibility \u03c7(T ) = const., electrical resistivity \u03c1(T ) \u221d T 2 etc.\nQCPs are not the only mechanism to provide NFL behaviour. If the magnetic order changes\nfrom long-range to short-range and disorder comes into play, spatial regions (also called \"rare\nregions\") can show local magnetic order, although the bulk system is in a PM state [3]. The order\nparameter fluctuations of these regions can become strong enough to destroy the QPT and can\ngive rise to NFL effects [4, 5, 6]. Here, the length scale of order parameter fluctuations becomes\nfinite, while the time scale still diverges. As a consequence in, e.g., the quantum Griffiths phase\n(QGP) scenario, power-law corrections, C/T \u221d \u03c7\u2032 \u221d T \u03bb\u22121 and M \u221d H \u03bb with 0 \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 1, are\n\n\fexpected in a broad region across the QCP and not only at the QCP itself [7]. The global\nphase transition is then smeared [8], as observed in doped ferromagnetic (FM) materials, as ,\ne.g., the itinerant Zr1\u2212x Nbx Zn2 [9], the 5f -based HF system URh1\u2212x Rux Ge [10] and the Cebased CePd1\u2212x Rhx [11]. The ground state of such systems depends on several factors and can\nbe very exotic, as in CeNi1\u2212x Cux , where a percolative cluster scenario has been proposed [12].\nRecently, we reported on the formation of a \"Kondo-cluster-glass\" state in CePd1\u2212x Rhx for\n0.7 \u2264 x \u2264 0.9, caused by the freezing of clusters with predominantly FM coupling: they\nform below a temperature Tcl and freeze at a lower temperature Tc\u2217 [13]. In CePd1\u2212x Rhx , the\nchemical substitution of the Ce-ligand Pd by Rh induces not just a negative volume effect, but,\nmore importantly, it locally increases the hybridisation strength J of the cerium 4f electrons,\nleading to a strong enhancement of the local TK . Simultaneously, disorder is introduced to\nthe system, which induces a statistical distribution of TK . Both effects create regions where f\nmoments are still unscreened and can form FM clusters because of the RKKY interaction [14].\nIn the temperature region Tc\u2217 < T < Tcl we have observed power-law behaviour of several\nthermodynamic quantities, i.e. C/T (T ), \u03c7\u2032 (T ), M (H) [13, 15], and we concluded that the\nquantum Griffiths phase scenario might be realised in CePd1\u2212x Rhx for Rh content 0.8 \u2264 x \u2264 0.9.\nFor x < 0.8 the system is too close to the FM long-range order to be considered in the QGP.\nIn this article we take a closer look at the magnetic susceptibility \u03c7\u2032 and magnetisation M in\nsingle crystals with Rh content xc \u2248 0.8 within the frame of the QGP scenario.\nBefore starting with the analysis of the results, we have to consider that the QGP is restricted\nto a small region of the temperature - magnetic field (T \u2212 H) phase diagram. This region is\nlimited to the ranges Tc\u2217 < T < Tcl and H(Tc\u2217 ) < H < H(Tcl ), where H(Tc\u2217 ) and H(Tcl ) are,\nrespectively, the magnetic fields necessary to destroy the glass state and to remove the effect\nof the cluster formation (cf. inset of Fig. 1 (b)). Both Tc\u2217 and H(Tc\u2217 ) have very low values of\nthe order of mK and mT. To study the dynamic processes in the region close to x = 0.8, \u03c7\u2032\nwas measured down to 0.02 K (Fig. 1), at a frequency of 113 Hz, with a modulation field of\n10\n\n10 mT\n\n1\n1\n\n-3\n\nx = 0.80, \u03bb = -0.12\nx = 0.82, \u03bb = +0.1\nx = 0.85, \u03bb = +0.4\nx = 0.86, \u03bb = +0.45\n\n0.1\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n(a)\n1\n\nT (K)\n\n\u03c7 \u2032 (10-6 m3/mol)\n\nCePd0.2Rh0.8\n\n0 mT\n\nM (10 \u03bcB/Ce)\n\n\u03c7 \u2032 (10-6 m3/mol)\n\nCePd1-xRhx\n\n10 mT\n\n1\n5 mT\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4 5\n\n(b)\n\n1\n\nT (K)\n\nFigure 1. Frame (a): Ac susceptibility \u03c7\u2032 of four single crystals plotted as a function of the\ntemperature on a double-logarithmic scale. The lines indicate fits with \u03c7\u2032 \u221d T \u03bb\u22121 above Tc\u2217 .\nThe curves present a hump at about 3 K, which is possibly due to impurity phases. Frame\n(b): \u03c7\u2032 vs T of CePd0.2 Rh0.8 at different magnetic fields: 0, 5 and 10 mT. The line represents a\nlinear fit performed between 3.5 K and 1.5 K. Inset of frame (b): FC and ZFC measurements of\nthe magnetisation at constant fields of 5 and 10mT down to 2 K. The FC and ZFC data splits\nslightly below Tcl in 5 mT, where clusters form; a field of 10 mT is enough to remove this effect.\n\n\f\u03bc0 hac = 11 \u03bcT. The dc magnetisation M was measured with a SQUID (Quantum Design) at\nhigh temperatures and with a high-resolution Faraday magnetometer, in magnetic fields as high\nas 11 T and at temperatures down to 0.05 K (Fig. 2 and 3)[16]. The magnetic field has been\napplied along the c axis in all the measurements presented here. It is worth mentioning that the\nmagnetic anisotropy of the system is low for x > 0.7 [17] and poly- and single crystals exhibit\nsimilar behaviour [13].\nIn frame (a) of Fig. 1, the real part of the ac susceptibility is plotted as a function of T in\na double-logarithmic scale for four crystals of CePd1\u2212x Rhx with 0.8 \u2264 x \u2264 0.86. The peak\ntemperature is Tc\u2217 . In frame (b), \u03c7\u2032 is shown only for the crystal with x = 0.8 at different\nfields. Tcl \u2248 5 K has been determined as the temperature where the field-cooled (FC) and\nzero-field-cooled (ZFC) measurements of M split, as illustrated in the inset of the same frame.\nAs in polycrystals, \u03c7\u2032 follows a T \u03bb\u22121 power-law function above Tc\u2217 where the exponent \u03bb varies\nsystematically with x between -0.12 and 0.45 [13], as expected in the QGP scenario. The value of\nthe exponents seems to be independent of the impurity phases observed at about 3 K (see curve\nfor x = 0.82). The negative \u03bb value for the sample with x = 0.8, different from the one measured\nin a polycrystal with the same x (\u03bb = 0.13), suggests that this sample is still too close to the\nFM instability. Moreover, the error in estimating the composition by energy dispersive X-ray\nspectrometry amounts to 1 at. % Rh. Taking into account that the sample with slightly higher\nRh content x = 0.82 shows \u03bb = 0.1, it is not possible from this measurement to discern whether\nthe sample with x = 0.8 can be considered in the QGP or not. Furthermore, the exponent is\naffected by the freezing which already takes place at Tc\u2217 \u2248 0.4 K. Focussing on the temperature\nrange between Tc\u2217 and Tcl , the \u03c7\u2032 vs T plot changes slope slightly at about 3.5 K, and again at\nabout 1.5 K (indicated by arrows). We have fitted this range to extract \u03bb, considering that in\nthe 10 mT curve the fit range can be expanded to even lower temperatures.\nTo verify the presence of a QGP in this sample, we have measured M vs H at different\ntemperatures. In Fig. 2 the isotherms are shown: In frame (a), the curve at 2 K is plotted\ntogether with those for two FM concentrations, x = 0.4 and 0.6, to emphasise the strong\ndecreasing of the magnetic moment with x; in frame (b), the isotherms at 0.05 K and 2 K are\n2\n\n(a)\n\nCePd1-xRhx\n\n(b)\n\nCePd0.2Rh0.8\n\n0.4\nx = 0.4\n\n0.3\n0.05 K\n1\n\n2K\n\nx = 0.6\n\n0.2\n\nM (\u03bcB/Ce)\n\nM (\u03bcB/Ce)\n\n1.5\n\n0.05\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0.1\n0.05 K\n\nx = 0.8\n\n-0.05\n\nT=2K\n\n-0.1\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\u03bc0H (T)\n\n6\n\n8\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n\u03bc0H (T)\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nFigure 2.

The magnetisation at 0.05 K shows a very small hysteresis (inset of Fig. 2), due to\nfreezing at Tc\u2217 \u2248 0.4 K, and it is far from reaching saturation at 10 T. We consider the value\nof the coercive field to be H(Tc\u2217 ) \u2248 0.1 T. Since Tcl \u2248 5 K \u2248 \u03bc * H, we can assume H(Tcl ) to\nbe close to 12 T, as the magnetic moment \u03bc at 12 T is only 0.4 \u03bcB . It is thus plausible to look\nfor QGP in M vs H for fields between 0.1 and 12 T. M vs H \u03bb is plotted in Fig. 3 at three\ntemperatures; below Tc\u2217 (0.05 K), just above it (0.5 K) and close to Tcl (2 K). The curves follow\na power-law behaviour, with an almost constant value of \u03bb \u2248 0.2, close to those observed in\n\u03c7\u2032 (T ) for the other crystals, as expected in the QGP. Since M vs H plots are less sensitive to\nparamagnetic impurities, and for H > H(Tc\u2217 ) the freezing does not affect the power law, these\nplots can be considered as signatures of a QGP in CePd0.2 Rh0.8 .\nAs discussed in the introduction, there is a fundamental difference between the NFL behaviour\ngiven by long-range and short-range order fluctuations. The presence of clusters and the powerlaw corrections to susceptibility and magnetisation in CePd1\u2212x Rhx indicate that the expected\nQPT at xc \u2248 0.8 is replaced by disordered phases, possibly like the Griffiths one.\nWe wish to thank T.
