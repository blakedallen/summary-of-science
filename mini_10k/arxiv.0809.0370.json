Also the charged lepton mass hierarchy can be achieved via spontaneous\nbreaking of the flavour symmetry. However, in most cases, a separate component of the\nflavour group is exploited to this purpose. Quite frequently the flavour group is of the\ntype D \u00d7 U (1)FN where D is a discrete component that controls the mixing angles and\nU (1)FN [3] is an abelian continuous symmetry that describes the mass hierarchy.\nIn the present talk, we will consider a class of flavour symmetries in which the same\nflavon fields producing the mixing pattern are also responsible for the mass hierarchy\nemploying an hybrid breaking pattern [4]. The idea is to selectively couple charged\nleptons and neutrinos to two different sets of flavons, \u03a6e and \u03a6\u03bd , respectively. The VEV\nof \u03a6\u03bd breaks G down to a residual symmetry in the neutrino sector preferably containing\nthe \u03bd\u03bc \u2212 \u03bd\u03c4 exchange symmetry as indicated by the oscillation data. While, the VEV of\n\u03a6e would break G down to a different subgroup, maximally breaking the previous \u03bd\u03bc \u2212 \u03bd\u03c4\nsymmetry, guaranteeing a hierarchical and quasi diagonal matrix ml .\nc Societ\u00e0 Italiana di Fisica\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nYIN LIN\n\n2. \u2013 Neutrino \u03bd\u03bc \u2212 \u03bd\u03c4 symmetry, charged lepton hierarchy and S3\nIn this section we will focus on the approximately vanishing values of \u03b813 and \u03b823 \u2212\u03c0/4.\nGiven an arbitrary choice of charged lepton mass matrix ml and effective neutrino mass\nmatrix m\u03bd , any change of basis in the generation space modifies the form of ml and m\u03bd ,\nbut does not change the physics. We can exploit this freedom to render diagonal the\ncharged lepton mass matrix ml :\n(2)\n\nm\u2032l = diag(me , m\u03bc , m\u03c4 ),\n\nm\u2032\u03bd = UP\u2217 MN S diag(m1 , m2 , m3 )UP\u2020 MN S .\n\nIn this basis, called flavour basis, the effective neutrino mass matrix is completely determined by the measurable quantities mi and UPMNS . In the limit where both \u03b813 and\n\u03b823 \u2212\u03c0/4 vanish, it is easy to verify that m\u2032\u03bd exhibits an exact \u03bd\u03bc \u2212\u03bd\u03c4 exchange symmetry.\nHowever, since \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u03c4 are members of the electroweak doublets, a naive extension of\nsuch a symmetry to include the charged leptons \u03bc, \u03c4 might be in contrast with the large\nmass hierarchy m\u03bc \u226a m\u03c4 . This problem is completely solved in the first paper of [4] by\nusing an hybrid symmetry pattern based on the flavour symmetry S3 .\nS3 is group of permutations of three distinct objects and is the smallest non-abelian\nsymmetry group. The six elements of the S3 group can be generated by S and T with\nthe following unitary representations (Rep):\n!\n!\n\u001a\n\u03c9 0\n0 1\n1\nS=1 T =1\n(3)\n.\nT =\n2 S=\n1\u2032 S = \u22121 T = 1\n0 \u03c92\n1 0\nS in the two-dimensional Rep corresponds to an interchange symmetry of the two components of a S3 doublet. The tensor products involving pseudo-singlets are given by\n1\u2032 \u00d7 1\u2032 = 1 and 1\u2032 \u00d7 2 = 2. While the product of two doublets is given by 2 \u00d7 2 = 2 + 1 + 1\u2032.\nGiven two doublets \u03c8 = (\u03c81 , \u03c82 ) and \u03c6 = (\u03c61 , \u03c62 ), it is easy to see that\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c81 \u03c62 + \u03c82 \u03c61 \u2208 1\n\u03c82 \u03c62\n(4)\n\u22082\n\u03c81 \u03c61\n\u03c81 \u03c62 \u2212 \u03c82 \u03c61 \u2208 1\u2032\nThe previous notion on the S3 group is sufficient to construct a simple model for\nleptons. The left-handed doublets transform as (1 + 2) of S3 and we will call le = (\u03bde , e)\nthe invariant singlet and Dl = (l\u03bc , l\u03c4 ) the S3 doublet. The right-handed charged leptons\nec , \u03bcc , \u03c4 c are all in the non-trivial singlet representation 1\u2032 . The S3 flavour symmetry is\nspontaneously broken at a scale \u223c VEV \u226a \u039b, \u039b being the cutoff scale, by two doublets\n\u03c6e , \u03c6\u03bd and a singlet \u03be which are all gauge singlets. The flavon fields will develop VEVs\nof the type\n(5)\n\nh\u03c6e i \u221d (1, 0) ,\n\nh\u03c6\u03bd i = (1, 1) ,\n\nh\u03bei =\n6 0\n\n.\n\nIt is possible to impose an extra abelian symmetry Z3 in such a way that \u03c6\u03bd and \u03be couple\nonly to the neutrino sector and \u03c6e to the charged lepton sector. Since h\u03c6\u03bd i is preserved\nby S, we immediately conclude that in the neutrino sector S3 is broken down to a Z2\nsubgroup. Being Dl doublet of S3 , this residual Z2 parity will exactly lead to the \u03bd\u03bc \u2212 \u03bd\u03c4\nexchange symmetry. Concerning the charged lepton sector, the VEV of \u03c6e breaks the\nparity symmetry generated by S in a maximal way, since\n(6)\n\nh\u03c6e i\u2020 Sh\u03c6e i = 0 .\n\n\f3\n\nMASS HIERARCHY AND FLAVOUR MIXING FROM DISCRETE SYMMETRIES\n\nThe singlets ec , \u03bcc and \u03c4 c should couple to (Dl \u03c6e )\u2032 , (Dl \u03c6e \u03c6e )\u2032 and l1 (\u03c6e \u03c6e \u03c6e )\u2032 at the\nleading orders. From the S3 multiplication rules given in (4) we see that the last combinations select respectively e, \u03bc and \u03c4 after the electroweak and flavour symmetry breaking.\nAs a consequence m\u03c4 , m\u03bc , me get their first non-vanishing contribution at the order\nh\u03c6e i/\u039b, (h\u03c6e i/\u039b)2 , (h\u03c6e i/\u039b)3 , respectively. Then we obtain the correct charged lepton\nhierarchy assuming h\u03c6T i/\u039b \u223c \u03bb2c , being \u03bbc the Cabibbo angle.\n3. \u2013 TB mixing and charged lepton hierarchy from A4\nIn this section we extend the previous construction to describe the TB mixing pattern by an hybrid symmetry breaking of A4 [4], improving some aspects of the original\nproposal of [5]. The generators of A4 , S and T , have the following Reps:\n\n(7)\n\n1\n1\u2032\n1\u2032\u2032\n\nS=1 T =1\nS = 1 T = \u03c92\nS=1 T =\u03c9\n\n3\n\n\uf8eb\n\n1 0\nT = \uf8ed 0 \u03c92\n0 0\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u22121\n0\n1\n0 \uf8f8 S= \uf8ed 2\n3\n2\n\u03c9\n\n\uf8f6\n2\n2\n\u22121 2 \uf8f8\n2 \u22121\n\nFrom (2), one can generally show that the most general mass matrix in the flavour basis\nleading to TB mixing obeys the \"magic\" symmetry GS \u2243 Z2 generated by S in addition\nto the \u03bd\u03bc \u2212 \u03bd\u03c4 exchange symmetry analyzed in the previous section.\nWe assign the lepton doublets li (i = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 ) to the triplet A4 representation and the\nlepton singlets ec , \u03bcc , \u03c4 c \u223c 1. The symmetry breaking sector consists of the scalar fields\n(\u03c6T , \u03c6S , \u03be), transforming as (3, 3, 1) of A4 . Under certain conditions, the minimization\nof the scalar potential naturally leads to the following VEV alignment:\n(8)\n\nh\u03c6T i \u221d (0, 1, 0) ,\n\nh\u03c6S i \u221d (1, 1, 1) ,\n\nh\u03bei =\n6 0 .\n\nIn the neutrino sector A4 is broken by (\u03c6S , \u03be) down to GS . The absence of the scalar\nsinglets 1\u2032 and 1\u2032\u2032 in the neutrino sector implies that, in addition to GS , the resultant\nneutrino mass matrix is also automatically symmetric under the exchange of the second\nand third generations. Then the residual symmetry in the neutrino sector is enhanced\nand imposes UPMNS to be of the TB form independently from the mass eigenvalues. In\nthe charged lepton sector, the VEV of \u03c6T breaks the \u03bd\u03bc \u2212 \u03bd\u03c4 exchange symmetry in a\nmaximal way similar to the case of S3 . The masses me , m\u03bc and m\u03c4 arise at the order\nh\u03c6T i/\u039b, (h\u03c6T i/\u039b)2 and (h\u03c6T i/\u039b)3 respectively leading to a hierarchical mass spectrum.\n\u2217 \u2217 \u2217\nI wish to thank the organizers of IFAE 2008 and F.
