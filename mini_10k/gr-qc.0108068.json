Here we define its natural generalization, when the background space\n(lattice, graph), where the field is defined, is itself random. Moreover, this randomness is not given apriori and\nindependently of the configuration, but the space and the configuration on it depend on each other and are given\nby a kind of Gibbs construction. The resulting distribution is called a Gibbs family because it parametrizes\nfinite of continuum set of pairs (G, \u03bc), where G is a graph, \u03bc is some Gibbs measure on G, belonging to the\nsupport of the distribution. Even if the set of configurations is trivial, one gets a nontrivial object, which is\ncalled a Gibbs graph.\nQuantum analog of Gibbs families is a generalization of quantum spin system to the case of \"quantum\"\nlattice [4]. If there is no spin we also get an interesting object called quantum graph (lattice,complex, space).\nWe give here mathematical foundations of such theory, which includes many different aspects - from the\ngeneral notion of locality to combinatorics of graphs.\nAnother motivation were questions which appear naturally while thinking about analytic and probabilistic\nmotivations of such modern physical theories as string theory, M -theory, and many other approaches to quantum\ngravity. These theories now are on the physical level of rigorousness, having however many deep algebraic and\ngeometric mathematics.\nFirst obvious question is \"what is locality if there is no background space ?\" The space in physical theories\nnormally is given apriori - as the scene for all further actions. For a long time only three dimensional euclidean\nspace were used in physics. In the 20 century the dimension d was allowed to vary, also arbitrary smooth\nmanifolds were studied instead of Rd . Moreover, the global structure of the manifold is can may depend on the\nmatter fields via the general relativity equations, restrictions of the string theory etc. However, the postulate of\nthe local smoothness was unquestionable, and rests as it is until now in many modern theories. This postulate,\nbeing very convenient for differential geometry techniques, is the main source of divergences in quantum field\ntheory and difficulties with attempts to quantize the metrics itself. The logics of things puts natural questions\nof what could be a replacement for local euclidean postulate.\nAt present many working in the field are looking answers in notions of discrete and noncommutative [5, 6, 7, 8]\nspaces. However, even in physics discrete spaces are considered to be subsets of some \"background space\", and\nnoncommutative spaces are smooth deformations of locally euclidean spaces. Moreover, there is a tendency in\nphysics to put the space on equal footing with matter fields. In particular, this means that it should be random\nor quantum.\nIt appears immediately that for general discrete spaces the mere notion of locality can have different definitions, which are discussed here. Locality in physics is assiated with the Markov-Gibbs property. The \"local\"\nspace is constructed from discrete elements (quanta) via a special (Gibbs) procedure. There are two main\npossibilitires to do this. If one assumes that a neighborhood of the point may have any number of quanta then\nto get classical spaces one needs renormalization procedures similar to renormalization in quantum fields theory.\nIf one understands locality in more restrictive \"metric\" sense, that is when a quantum is a neighborhood itself,\nthen one does not need renormalizations. The latter understanding is not quite satisfactory because the metrics\nitself may vary sufficiently.\nThe plan of the paper is the following. In section 2.1 we introduce two definitions of finite Gibbs discrete\nspaces (Gibbs families). First of all we introduce a simple and useful notion of a graph with a local structure, it\nincludes simplicial complexes and many other general \"space-like\" objects. The first definition (local) is when\nthe energy of the graph is equal to the sum of energies of its subgraphs, the second one (superlocal), when the\nenergy is the sum of energies of all neighborhoods of a given radius. It is shown that these two definitions can\nbe reduced to each other by only using a procedure, similar to renormalization in the quantum field theory.\nIn section 2.2 we consider limiting Gibbs families, give the analog of the Dobrushin-Lanford-Ruelle condition\nfor Gibbs fields and the compactness condition. For a given Gibbs family the conditional measure (for a fixed\ngraph G) on the configurations on G is a Gibbs measure in the standard sense with the same potential.\nIn section 2.3 we discuss an important subtle question \"what is a random countable graph ?\". One of the\npossibilities is to assume the existence of a fixed vertex (origin). If not, then one could (very unnaturally) assume\na common enumeration of the vertices af each countable graph, also to consider countable graphs imbedded\nto a common \"background\" space. However, without such assumptions the Kolmogorov methods to define a\nprobability measure via finite-dimensional distributions does not work. We have thus to define a substitute\nfor probability measures on the equivalence classes of countable graphs. This analog is called an empirical\ndistribution, and we give examples of such distributions from discrete quantum gravity.\nIn section 3 we discuss the asymptotics of partition\nfunctions for different models of discrete spaces. In\nP\nparticular we get the logarithmic asymptotics of g Fb,p (g) for p \u2192 \u221e, b = \u03b1p, where Fb,p (g) is the number of\n2\n\n\fmaps with p + 1 vertices and b + p edges on the closed compact surface of genus g. Note that a particular case\nof a map is a triangulation, and the experience for censoring maps on a surface with fixed genus shows similar\nasymptotical behaviour for different classes of maps.\nIn section 4 we consider phase transitions. In section 4.2 we study in detail the simplest model of pure\nplanar gravity (with one boundary) where one has a complete control: existence of the thermodynamic limit,\nexplicit free energy, complete phase diagram, including the critical point. We have here also an effect of\nthe influence of the observer on fluctuations of the boundary in the critical point. The corresponding model\nwith two boundaries is studied only in the \"high temperature\" case. In section 4.3 we give an example of the\ntopological phase transition in a locally homogeneous graph, where all vertices have isomorphic 1-neighborhoods.\nIn 4.4 we prove the uniqueness of the limiting Gibbs family for a model with factorial growth of the partition\nfunction. This allows to give a local Gibbs characterization of tress and free noncommutative groups. In 4.5 we\ndiscuss how different topologies could appear on different scales. The notion of scale includes thermodynamicn\nhydrodynamic limits etc.\nIn section 5.1 we introduce quantum analogs of Gibbs graphs with a local structure - quantum grammars\non graphs. We prove basic results concerning selfadjointness of the hamiltonian, existence of the automorphism\ngroup of the corresponding C \u2217 -algebras. Quantum spin systems are a very particular case of this construction.\nFor linear graphs in the high temperature region we prove existence and uniqueness of KMS states. In 5.2 we\ngive many examples of C \u2217 -algebras and hamiltonians for quantum grammars: linear grammars and Toeplitz\noperators, quantum expansion and contraction of the space, Lorentzian models etc.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nGibbs Families\nFinite Gibbs families\n\nSpin graphs We consider graphs G (finite or countable) with the set V = V (G) of vertices and the set\nL = L(G) of edges. It is always assumed that there is at most one edge between any two vertices and that each\nvertex has a finite degree (the number of incident edges). Graphs are assumed to be connected, no loops, unless\notherwise stated. However, general results can be easily reformulated for graphs with loops and multiple edges.\nIn this case the loop adds number 2 to the degree of the vertex.\nSubgraph of the graph G is defined by a set of vertices V1 \u2282 V together with some edges, inherited from L\nand connecting some vertices from V1 . A subgraph G(V1 ) of the graph G with the set V1 of vertices is called\nregular if it contains each edge in L(G) from the vertices of V1 .\nThe set V of vertices is a metric space, if the distance d(x, y) between vertices x, y \u2208 V is defined as the\nminimal length (number of vertices) in a path, connecting these vertices.\nSpin graph \u03b1 = (G, s) is defined as some graph G together with a function s : V \u2192 S, where S is some set\n(spinvalues). Graphs and spin graphs are always considered up to an isomorphism that is no enumeration of\nvertices is assumed. Isomorphism is a one-to-one correspondence between vertices, respecting edges and spins.\nLet GN (AN ) be the set of equivalence classes (with respect to isomorphisms) of connected graphs (spin graphs)\nwith N vertices. Countable graphs correspond to N = \u221e.\nFurther on we use a somewhat free terminology: we say graph or spin graph instead of equivalence class,\nsubgraph instead of spin subgraph (thus omitting the adjective spin) etc.\nSpin graphs with the origin We shall also consider graphs with a specified vertex (rooted graphs),\ncalled the origin or the root. In this case all isomorphisms are assumed to respect the origin. When one has to\n(v)\nstress that the considered graphs have the root v, we shall write G(v) , GN etc.\nDefine the annular neighbourhood \u03b3(\u03b1, v; a, b) of vertex v to be the regular subgraph of the spin graph \u03b1 with\nthe set of vertices V (\u03b3(\u03b1, v; a, b)) = {v \u2032 : a \u2264 d(v, v \u2032 ) \u2264 b}. Od (v) = \u03b3(\u03b1, v; 0, d) is called the d-neighborhood\nof v, O(v) = O1 (v). R0 (G) = maxv\u2208V (G) d(0, v) is the radius of G with respect to vertex 0. In particular,\nRv (O(v)) = 1. Then the diameter of the graph G is d(G) = maxv,v\u2032 \u2208V (G) d(v, v \u2032 ) = maxv\u2208V (G) Rv (G).\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\nDenote GN (AN ) the set of equivalence classes of connected graphs (spin graphs) with root 0 and radius\nN with respect to 0.\n(0)\nDenote A(0) = \u222aN 6=\u221e AN the set of all finite graphs with root 0.\nGraphs with a local structure Spin graph is a particular case of a graph with a local structure. This\nnotion is sufficient for description of any multidimensional objects.\n(0)\n\nDefinition 1 Let the function s(\u03b3) on Ad be given together with the function t(\u03b3) on the set A(d) of spin\ngraphs of diameter d with values in some set S. Superlocal structure (of radius d) on G is given by the set of\n3\n\n\fvalues s(Od (v)), v \u2208 V (G). Local structure (of diameter d) on G is given by the set of values t(\u03b3) for all regular\ngraphs \u03b3 of diameter d.\nExamples:\n\u2022 Spin graphs correspond to a local (or superlocal) structure with d = 0. Many definitions and results for\nspin graphs, obtained below, can be generalized on the case d > 0 by simple rewriring.\n\u2022 Gauge fields on graphs: for each vertex and for each edge values from a group R are defined, in this case\none can take d = 1.\n\u2022 Simplicial complex is completely defined by the function on its one-dimensional skeleton: it takes value 1\non each complete regular subgraph \u03b3 of diameter 1, iff this subgraph defines a simplex of the corresponding\ndimension, and 0 otherwise. Here one can also take d = 1.\n\u2022 Penrose quantum networks [10, 9]: in a finite graph, each vertex of which has degree 3, to each edge l some\ninteger pl = 2sl is prescribed, where halfintegers sl are interpreted as degrees of irreducible representations\nof SU (2). Moreover, in each vertex the following condition is assumed satisfied: the sum of pi , for all three\nincident edges, is even and any pi does not exceed the sum of two other values. Then for the tensor product\nof three representations there exists a unique (up to a factor) invariant element, which is prescribed to\nthis vertex.\n\u2022 However, there are structures on graphs which cannot be characterized as graphs with a local structure.\nExamples are trees, Cayley graphs etc. We shall see later, however, that Gibbs characterization (also local\nin some sense) is possible.\n\u03c3-algebra and free measure Let A be an arbitrary set of finite spin graphs \u03b1 = (G, s). Let G = G(A)\nbe the set of all graphs G for which there exists a function s with \u03b1 = (G, s) \u2208 A. It is always assumed that if\n\u03b1 = (G, s) \u2208 A, then for any s\u2032 all (G, s\u2032 ) also belong to A.\nThen A is a topological space, a discrete (finite or countable) union of topological spaces TG = S V (G) , G \u2208\nG(A). Borel \u03c3-algebra on A is generated by the cylindrical subsets A(G, Bv , v \u2208 V (G)), G \u2208 G, where Bv\nare some Borel subsets of S. Moreover, A(G, Bv , v \u2208 V (G)) is the set of all \u03b1 = (G, s) such that for some\nfixed graph G the functions (configurations) s(v) : V (G) \u2192 S satisfy the following condition: s(v) \u2208 Bv for all\nv \u2208 V (G).\nLet on S a nonnegative (not necessary probabilistic) measure \u03bb0 be given. The free measure is the following\nnonnegative measure \u03bbA on A, defined by\nY\n\u03bb0 (Bv )\n(1)\n\u03bbA (A(G, Bv , v \u2208 V (G))) =\nv\u2208V (G)\n\nPotentials Potential (local) is a function \u03a6 : \u222aN <\u221e AN \u2192 R \u222a {+\u221e}, that is a function on the set of\nfinite spin graphs, invariant with respect to isomorphisms. If \u03a6 can take value \u221e, then we say that \u03a6 has a\nhard core.\nWe say that \u03a6 has a finite diameter, if \u03a6(\u03b1) = 0 for all \u03b1 with diameter greater than some d. Minimal such\nd is called the diameter of \u03a6.\nFor the potential \u03a6 the energy of the subgraph \u03b1 is defined as\nX\nH(\u03b1) =\n\u03a6(\u03b3), \u03b1 = (G, s)\n(2)\n\u03b3\u2282\u03b1\n\nwhere the sum is over all regular connected subgraphs \u03b3 of the spin graph \u03b1.\nA particular case is the chemical potential. It is given by the function \u03a6, equal to some constant \u03bc0 for each\nvertex v, indepedently of the spin in v, and equal to some constant \u03bc1 for each edge, and equal 0 in other cases.\nOtherwise speaking the chemical potential is\nHN (\u03b1) = \u03bc0 V (\u03b1) + \u03bc1 L(\u03b1)\nwhere V (\u03b1), L(\u03b1) are the numbers of vertices and edges of \u03b1.\n\n4\n\n(3)\n\n\fFinite Gibbs families Let A be some set of finite spin graphs. Gibbs A-family with potential \u03a6 is a\nprobability measure \u03bcA on A, defined by the following density withy respect to the free measure\nd\u03bcA\n(\u03b1) = Z \u22121 exp(\u2212\u03b2H(\u03b1)), \u03b1 \u2208 A\nd\u03bbA\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b2 \u2265 0 is the inverse temperature. Moreover it is assumed that Z 6= 0, that is H(\u03b1) < \u221e at least for\none \u03b1 \u2208 A. Below we give examples when Z = 0. We shall assume also that, when A is infinite, the following\nstability condition holds\nZ\nZ = Z(A) =\n\nA\n\nexp(\u2212\u03b2H(\u03b1))d\u03bbA < \u221e\n\n(5)\n\nIf S is trivial (consists of one element), we will get a probability distribution on the set of graphs, which will\nbe called a Gibbs graph.\n(0)\n\nStability Potential \u03a6 is said to be stable on AN if for any N the partition function ZN < \u221e. Potential\n\u03a6 \u2261 0 is obviously not stable, and the chemical potential with \u03bc0 = 0 as well.\n(0)\n\nLemma 1 The chemical potential AN is not stable for any finite \u03bc0 , \u03bc1 .\nProof. Let g(n, k) be the number of graphs of radius 1, which have the origin 0 of degree n, and moreover,\nthe number of edges between other vertices ia k. It is sufficient to prove that\nGn =\n\nN\nX\n\nk=0\n\ng(n, k) exp(\u2212\u03bc1 (k + n) \u2212 \u03bc0 (n + 1))\n\nis the number of different vertices of n enumerated vertices.\ngrows together with n, where N = n(n\u22121)\n2\nk\nIn fact, the number of graphs with n enumerated vertices and k edges equals CN\n. At the same time the\nnumber of ways to enumerate n vertices is not greater than n! = 2n log n+O(n) . Let us prove that for any \u03bc1\nthere exists sufficiently small \u03b4 > 0 such that for k = \u03b4N, n \u2192 \u221e one has Gn \u2192 \u221e. We have\ng(n, k) exp(\u2212\u03bc1 (k + n) \u2212 \u03bc0 (n + 1)) \u2248\n\u2248 2\u2212N (\u03b4 ln \u03b4+(1\u2212\u03b4) ln(1\u2212\u03b4))+O(n log n) exp(\u2212\u03bc1 (k + n) \u2212 \u03bc0 (n + 1)) >\n> exp(\u2212\u03bc1 \u03b4N )2N (\u2212\u03b4 ln \u03b4+\u03b4)+O(n log n) \u2192 \u221e\n\nif \u03b4 is sufficiently small.\nInstability can appear because of big degrees of vertices. That is why regularization is necessary. One of the\npossibilities is to introduce regularizing potentials.\nAn example of regularizing potential is the following potential. Let \u03b3 2 (\u03b3 3 ) be the graph consisting of three\nvertices 1, 2, 3 and two edges 12, 13 (three edges 12, 13, 23). Potential \u03a62 = \u03bc2 P (\u03b1), where P (\u03b1) is the number\nof regular subgraphs of \u03b1, isomorphic to \u03b3 2 or to \u03b3 3 , garanties the stability of the potential \u03a6 + \u03a62 for many\n\u03a6. For exmple, the following proposition holds, which is not difficult to prove.\nProposition 1 If \u03bc2 > ln 2, then the potential \u03a6 = \u03a60 + \u03a61 + \u03a62 is stable for any \u03bc0 , \u03bc1 \u2265 0.\nHowever', more interesting potentials are those which are equal \u221e on graphs of special kind. For example,\nit is infinite on all graphs with diameter greater or equal 1 or 2, which also have at least one vertex of degree\nr + 1. Such potential is equivalent to the apriori restricting ourselves to the class of graphs, eahc vertex of which\nhas degree not exceeding r.\nAnother possibility is to revise the notion of locality.\nLocality and Superlocality In many papers on discrete quantum gravity it is assumed apriori that the\naction takes place on a smooth or piecewise linear manifold of some fixed dimension. But then locally the space\nis classical. More consistent program could be to refuse from such assumptions. But then the central question\narises: what is locality if there is no background space?\nOne sees immediately that locality can be understood in many ways. Firstly, local can be an object, if it\nis defined in terms of \"small\" connected subgraphs. An essentially stronger notion of locality - superlocality arises when we know that such subgraph coincides with some neighbourhood of a vertex. Accordingly, call a\n(0)\nsuperlocal potential of radius r a function \u03a6 : Ar \u2192 R \u222a {+\u221e}, that is a function on the set of finite rooted\nspin graphs of radius r with respect to 0, invariant with respect to the isomorphisms.\n5\n\n\fThe energy of the superlocal potential is defined as\nX\n\u03a6(Or (v)),\nH(\u03b1) =\nv\u2208V (\u03b1)\n\nwhere the sum is over all vertices of the spin graph \u03b1. In this case we shall call Gibbs families superlocal, and\nthe Gibbs families defined above will be called local.\nSuperlocal potential can be reduced to a local one, but only with some additional limiting procedure, see\nbelow. One can say that if one wants to describe the world locally but without apriori restrictions on the\nstructure of the graphs, then we should use renormalizations.\nTo construct examples the following classes of graphs are useful. Let us consider a set of \"small\" graphs\nG1 , ..., Gk with root 0 and having radius r with respect to 0. We shall say that graph G is generated by graphs\nG1 , ..., Gk , if any vertex of G has a neighborhood (of radius r) isomorphic to some of the generators G1 , ..., Gk .\nDenote G(G1 , ..., Gk ) the set of all such graphs. Introduce a superlocal potential \u03a6 = \u03a6G1 ,...,Gk of radius r,\nputting \u03a6(\u0393) = 0, if the rooted subgraph \u0393 is isomorphic to one of the Gi , and \u03a6(\u0393) = \u221e otherwise. It is\nobvious that any Gibbs family with potential \u03a6 has the support on G(G1 , ..., Gk ).\nExample of ZN = 0 Even finite Gibbs families with potential \u03a6 = \u03a6G1 ,...,Gk do not necessarily exist. As\nthe simplest example consider the case with k = 1, r = 1, when G1 is a finite complete graph gm of radius 1\nwith m + 1 vertices 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., m and root 0. Then it is \"selfgenerating\" and G(G1 ) consists of one element gm itself.\nAnother example. Introduce the graphs gm,0 with m + 1 vertices 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., m and m edges 01, 02, ..., 0m,\nand gm,m with m + 1 vertices 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., m and 2k edges 01, 02, ..., 0m, 12, 23, ..., m1. One can see that the\npentagon G1 = g5,5 cannot generate a countable graph.\nRenormalization Superlocal potential can be expressed with local potentials in the following way. We\nshall explain this for the case k = 1, let the radius of G1 be r. We shall construct a finite Gibbs family with\nsupport on G(G1 ), without using superlocal potentials. Let F (G1 ) be the set of all graphs, isomorphic to some\nproper regular subgraph \u03b3 of G1 and such that the radius of \u03b3 with respect to some vertex v \u2208 V (\u03b3) equals r.\nLet F (\u0393, \u03b3) be the set of all proper regular subgraphs of \u0393, isomorphic to \u03b3.\nIntroduce the \"cut-off\" local potential \u03a6R as follows:\n\u2022 \u03a6R (\u03b3) = \u221e for graphs \u03b3, having radius r with respect to some of its vertices and such that \u03b3 6= G1 and\n\u03b3\u2208\n/ F (G1 );\n\u2022 \u03a6R (\u03b3) = 0 for graphs which do not have radius r for any of its vertices;\n\u2022 \u03a6R (\u03b3) = R, R > 0, for any graph \u03b3 \u2208 F (G1 ),\n\u2022 \u03a6R (G1 ) = 0.\nThe limit for R \u2192 \u221e of the Gibbs family \u03bcA (R) with potential \u03a6R may not exist, but the following theorem\nholds.\n(j)\n\nTheorem 1 Assume that G(G1 ) \u2229 AN 6= \u2205. Then there is such k and such local potentials \u03c6R , j = 1, 2, ...k,\nthat the limit as R \u2192 \u221e of the Gibbs family on AN with renormalized potential\n(ren)\n\n\u03a6R\n\n= \u03a6R +\n\nk\nX\n\n(j)\n\n\u03c6R\n\nj=1\n\nexists and has its support on G(G1 ) \u2229 AN .\n(j)\n\nProof. Define the potentials (counterterms) \u03c6R , equal zero everywhere except for the following cases:\n\u2022 if \u0393 is isomorphic to G1 , then\n(1)\n\n\u03c6R (\u0393) =\n\nX\n\n\u03b3\u2208F (G1 )\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n\u03c6R,\u03b3 (\u0393), \u03c6R,\u03b3 (\u0393) = \u2212R\n\nX\n\n1\n\n\u0393\u2208F (G1 ,\u03b3)\n\n\u2022 for any j \u2265 2, if \u0393 is the union of j pairwise different subgraphs \u0393i , i = 1, ..., j, where each \u0393i is isomorphic\nG1 , then\nX\nX\n(j)\n(j)\n(j)\n1\n\u03c6R,\u03b3 (\u0393), \u03c6R,\u03b3 (\u0393) = (\u22121)j R\n\u03c6R (\u0393) =\n\u0393\u2208F (\u03931 ,\u03b3)\u2229...\u2229F (\u0393j ,\u03b3)\n\n\u03b3\u2208F (G1 )\n\n6\n\n\f(j)\n\nNote that it follows from the definition that \u03c6R = 0 starting from some j. Consider a vertex v. If its\nneighborhood Or (v) does not belong to F (G1 ), then \u03a6R equals \u221e, and thus it is impossible. Let now the\nneighborhood Or (v) is not isomorphic to G1 and thus belongs to F (G1 ). Then the potential \u03a6R is R on it, and\n(ren)\nthe counterterms equal 0. It follows that \u03a6R\nequals R as well. Consider now some subgraph \u03b3 \u2208 F (G1 ),\nwhich does not belong to exactly m subgraphs \u0393i , isomorphic to G1 . Then by inclusion-exclusion formula, for\nany \u03b3\nm\nX\n(j)\n\u03c6R,\u03b3 (g) = 0\n\u03a6R (\u03b3) +\nj=1\n\nThius the energy of the graphs from G(G1 ) \u2229 AN equals 0, and for the remaining graphs it is equal or greater\nthan R, this give the result.\n(j)\nNote that \u03c6R (\u0393) are similar to counterterms of the standard renormalization theory. For k > 1 more\ncomplicated combinatoris appears. It could be very interesting to understand deeply connections of these\ncounterterms with the counterterms of quantum field theory for models with continuous spin.\n\n2.2\n\nLimiting Gibbs Families\n(0)\n\nIntroduce topology on the set A\u221e of countable spin graphs with origin 0, by defining the basis of open sets in it.\n(0)\nLet CN be an arbitrary open subset of the set AN of all spin graphs with radius N with respect to the origin.\nThen the open sets of the basis consist of all spin graphs such that (for some N and CN ) the N -neighborhood\n(0)\nof their origin belongs to CN . As the \u03c3 \u2212 a lg ebra in A\u221e we take the Borel \u03c3-algebra, generated by these open\nsets.\nFor any spin graph \u03b1 with root 0 call \u03b3(\u03b1, 0; N, N + d) N -annulus of width d, \u03b3(\u03b1, 0; 0, N ) - N -internal,\n\u03b3(\u03b1, 0; N, \u221e) - N -external parts correspondingly. Note that N -annulus and N -external part may be noncon(0)\n(0)\nnected. For given N, d and some finite graph \u03b3 (notnecessary connected) let AN +d (\u03b3, d) \u2282 AN +d be the set of\nall finite connected spin graphs \u03b1 with root 0 and radius N + d with respect to 0, and having \u03b3 as the N -annulus\nof width d.\nLet some local potential \u03a6 of diameter d + 1 be given.\n(0)\n\nDefinition 2 The measure \u03bc on A\u221e is called a Gibbs family with potential \u03a6, if for any N, \u03b3, \u0393 the conditional\n(0)\ndistribution on the set of spin graphs \u03b1 \u2208 A\u221e , having N -external part \u0393 and N -annulus \u03b3 of width d (this set\n(0)\ncan be naturally identified with AN +d (\u03b3, d)) coincides a.s. with the (finite) Gubbs family with potential \u03a6 on\n(0)\n\nAN +d (\u03b3, d).\n\nIn particular, this conditional distribution depends only on \u03b3, but not on all N -external part \u0393.\nBoundary conditions To construct pure phases, as for Gibbs fields, it is useful to have the notion of\nfinite Gibbs family with given boundary conditions. Boundary conditions (d-boundary conditions) are given\nby a sequence \u03bd N,d(\u03b3) of probability measures on the set of finite (not necessary connected) spin graphs \u03b3,\n(0)\nintuitively on N -annuli of width d.

There can be three reasons why limiting Gibbs states do\nnot exist: finite Gibbs states with this potential do not exist (see examples above), noncompactness of S, and\nalso - the distribution of finite Gibbs families can be concentrated on graphs, having vertices with large degrees.\nThe assumptions of the following proposition correspond to this list, however compactness can take place under\nmore general conditions.\n(0)\n(0)\nLet A\u221e (r) \u2282 A\u221e be the set of all countable spin graphs with vertices of degree not greater than r.\n7\n\n\fProposition 2 Let S be compact. Let \u03a6 have a finite diameter, and let \u03a6(\u03b3) = \u221e, if at least one vertex of \u03b3\n(0)\nhas degree r + 1. Let for any N there exists a Gibbs family with potential \u03a6 on AN . Then there exists a Gibbs\n(0)\n\nfamily with potential \u03a6, with support in A\u221e (r).\n\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\nProof. Consider the Gibbs families \u03bcN on AN , in fact on AN (r). Let \u03bc\u0303N be an arbitrary probability\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\nmeasure on A\u221e (r) such that its factor measure on AN (r) coincides with \u03bcN . Then the sequence of measures\n(0)\n\n\u03bc\u0303N on A\u221e (r) is compact, that may be proved by the standard diagonal procedure of enumeration of all\nN -neiborhoods. It is clear that any limiting point of the sequence \u03bc\u0303N is a Gibbs family with potential \u03a6.\n\nGibbs families and Gibbs fields From the following simple result it will be clear why we use the\nterm \"Gibbs family\". Let \u03bc be a Gibbs family with potential \u03a6. Assume that the conditions of the previous\n(0)\nproposition hold. Consider a measurable partition of the set A\u221e : any element SG of this partition is defined\nby a fixed graph G (without spins) and consists of all configurations sG on G.\nProposition 3 For a given graph G the conditional measure on the set of configurations SG = {sG } is a.s. a\nGibbs measure on G with the same potential \u03a6.\nNote that \"the same\" has the following obvious\nP interpretation: if \u039bN is the N -neighborhood of zero in G and\n\u03a6(\u03b3), where the summation is over all subgraphs of the spin\ns\u039bN is a configuration on \u039bN , then H(s\u039bN ) =\ngraph (\u039bN , s\u039bN ). Thus, any Gibbs family is a convex combination (of a very special kind) of Gibbs measures\n(fields) on fixed graphs, with the same potential. This convex combination is defined by the measure \u03bd = \u03bd(\u03bc)\n(0)\n(0)\non the factor space G\u221e = A\u221e / {SG }, induced by the measure \u03bc, corresponding to the Gibbs family.\nThe following lemma (having will known and useful analog for Gibbs fields) reduces the proof of the proposition to the corresponding results for finite Gibbs families. For finite graphs this result is a direct calculation\nwhich we omit.\n(0)\n\nLemma 2 Let \u03bc be a Gibbs family on A\u221e with potential \u03a6. Let \u03bd N +1,d (\u03b3) be the measure on N -annuli of\n(0)\nwidth d, induced by \u03bc. Then \u03bc is a weak limit of the Gibbs families on AN with potential \u03a6 and boundary\nconditions {\u03bd N +1,d (\u03b3)}.\n\n2.3\n\nEmpirical distributions\n(0)\n\nOne can construct probability measures on A\u221e in a standard way, using Kolmogorov approach with consistent\ndistributions on cylindrical subsets. However this approach will not work if we would like to construct probability\nmeasures on the set A\u221e of equivalencs classes of countable connected spin graphs. The problem is that there\nis no natural enumeration of in the countable set of vertices, and thus it is not clear how to introduce finitedimensional distributions. One could say that the problem is in the absence of the coordinate system, the\nreference point. That is why Kolmogorov approach cannot be directly used here. However, some substitute of\nfinite dimensional distributions exists. We call this analog an empirical distribution on A\u221e .\nLet S be finite or countable. Consider the system of numbers\no\nn\n(7)\n\u03c0 = p(\u0393), \u0393 \u2208 A(0) , 0 \u2264 p(\u0393) \u2264 1,\nthat is \u0393 are finite spin graphs with root 0. Introduce the consistency property of these numbers for any\nk = 0, 1, 2, ... and any fixed spin graph \u0393k of radius k (with respect to 0)\nX\np(\u0393k+1 ) = p(\u0393k ), k = 0, 1, 2, ...\n(8)\n\u0393k+1\n\nwhere the sum is over all spin graphs \u0393k+1 of radius k + 1 such that Ok (0) in \u0393k+1 is isomorphic to \u0393k . Remind\nthat in the latter formula it is assumed that the sum is over all equivalence classes of spin graphs.\nAssume also the normalization condition\nX\np(\u03930 ) = 1\n(9)\nwher \u03930 is the vertex 0 with arbitrary spin on it.\n\nDefinition 3 Any such system \u03c0 is called an empirical distribution (on the set of countable spin graphs).\n\n8\n\n\fOne can rewrite the consistency condition in terms of conditional probabilities\nX\np(\u0393k+1 | \u0393k ) = 1, k = 0, 1, ...\n\n(10)\n\n\u0393k+1\n\nwhere the summation is as above and\np(\u0393k+1 | \u0393k ) =\n\np(\u0393k+1 )\np(\u0393k )\n\n(11)\n\nThus, we consider A(0) as a tree, vertices of which are spin graphs, nd there exists an edge between \u0393k+1 and\n\u0393k iff \u0393k is isomorphic to the k-neighborhood of 0 in \u0393k+1 .\n(0)\nIt is clear that the system \u03c0 defines a probability measure on A\u221e . Naturalness of its interpretation as some\n\"measure\" on A\u221e follows from the following examples.\nExamples of empirical distributions can be obtained via the following limiting procedure, which we call an\n(0)\nempirical limit. Let \u03bcN be a probability measure on AN . For any N, k and any spin graphs \u0393 \u2208 Ak , \u03b1 \u2208 AN\nput\n\u001c N\n\u001d\nn (\u03b1, \u0393)\npN (\u0393) =\n(12)\nN\n\u03bcN\nwher n\bN (\u03b1, \u0393) is the number of vertices in \u03b1, having k-neighborhoods isomorphic to the spin graph \u0393. Put\n\u03c0 N = pN (\u0393) . One can take measures \u03bcN equal to some Gibbs families on AN with fixed potential. The\nsystem \u03c0 N is not an empirical distribution. However, the following result holds.\nLemma 3 Let S be finite and let for any D\n\u03bcN ( min D(\u03b1) \u2264 D) \u2192 0\n\n(13)\n\n\u03b1\u2208AN\n\nfor N \u2192 \u221e, where D(\u03b1) is the diameter of \u03b1. Then any weak point of the system \u03c0 N is an empirical distribution.\nProof. Note that the probability \u03bcN that for all vertices v of the random graph one has Rv (\u03b1) > D, tends to\n1 as N \u2192 \u221e. that is why for any n0 , \u03b4 > 0 there exists N0 = N0 (n0 , \u03b4) such that for any N > N0 the numbers\npN (\u0393) satisfy the consistency conditions for all \u0393k with k < n0 up to \u03b4. From finiteness of S the compactness\nfollows, that is the existence of at least one empirical distribution.\nRemark 1 The question arises how to characterize empirical distributions which can be obtained in this way,\nand in particular, what empirical distributions can be obtained from themselves, that is the limits of numbers\npN (\u0393) =\n\nnN (\u0393N , \u0393)\n\n\u03c0N\n\nhV (\u0393N )i\u03c0N\n(0)\n\nwhere V (\u0393N ) is the number of vertyices in \u0393N , \u03c0 N is the restriction of the measure \u03c0 on AN .\nRemark 2 Intuitively, an empirical measure is automatically \"homogeneous\", that is the same for any vertices.\nThe reason is that the vertices are not enumerated, or the graphs are not embedded to any space. Note that\n(0)\nhowever, one could easily construct \"inhomogeneous\" measures on A\u221e - it is sufficient to take \u03a6 depending on\nthe distance from 0.\nRemark 3 Another approach to empirical distributions is possible, based not on superlocality but on locality,\nwhen we \"do not know\" all neighborhood of a vertex. Let, for example, two graphs \u03b3 \u2282 \u0393 be given such that\nin \u0393 there is no other subgraph isomorphic to \u03b3. Then one can look for the limits of the following fractions\n(conditional empirical distributions)\n\u001d\n\u001c N\nn (\u03b1, \u0393)\nnN (\u03b1, \u03b3) \u03bc\nN\n\n9\n\n\f2.3.1\n\nEmpirical Gibbs families\n(0)\n\nLet us show that sometimes limiting Gibbs families on A\u221e can be obtained via the limit not in the radius\n(0)\ntending to infinity but in the number of vertices. Let BN,p be the set of spin graphs with N vertices, root 0,\n(0)\n\nand such that each vertex has the degree not greater than p. Consider the finite Gibbs family \u03bcN on BN,p with\nthe local potential \u03a6.\n(0)\n\nLemma 4 Any weak limiting point of the sequence \u03bcN is a limiting Gibbs family on A\u221e with potential \u03a6.\n(0)\n\nProof. Let us fix n, d and some \u03b1 \u2208 An+d+1,p with n-annulus \u03b3 of width d + 1. Then for any sufficiently large\n(0)\n\nN there exists \u03b2 \u2208 BN,p such that On+d+1 (\u03b2, 0) is isomorphic to \u03b1. For any such \u03b2 the conditional distribution\nOn (\u03b1, 0) under given \u03b3 is Gibbs with potential \u03a6.\nAn empirical distribution \u03c0 on A\u221e is called Gibbs if ois obtained as the empirical limit of finite Gibbs\nfamilies \u03c0 N on AN with potential \u03a6.\nTo justify this definition, let us show that under some conditions an empirical distribution \u03c0 on A\u221e is a\n(0)\nGibbs family as a measure A\u221e . Assume that the empirical distribution \u03c0 on A\u221e is Gibbs with potential \u03a6,\nequal to \u221e, if the degree of at least one vertex is greater than p, and that the probability \u03c0 N of the event that\nthe automorphism group of the graph \u03b1 \u2208 AN is trivial, tends to 1 as N \u2192 \u221e. Then \u03c0 is a Gibbs family as the\n(0)\nmeasure on A\u221e . In fact, is a graph has trivial automorphism group the, one can fix root at any vertex, what\n(0)\ngives different rooted graphs. Then we have Gibbs families on BN,p , and the previous lemma we get a limiting\n(0)\n\nGibbs family on A\u221e .\n2.3.2\n\nEmpirical distributions in planar quantum gravity\n\nOne should note that problem of existence of limiting correlation functions, normally ignored in physics, is far\nfrom being trivial. Besides its mathemtical interest, there another its aspect, which could have some interest\nfor physics as well. In physical discrete quantum gravity, where normally grand canonical ensemble is used,\nthe thermodynamic limit has physical sense only in some critical point, which defines the boundary of the\nregion where the series defining the grand partition function, converges. This critical point moreover, strongly\ndepends on geometric details even for the fixed topology. When the topology is not fixed, the corresponding\nseries diverges for all parameters, see below, even in dimension 2, because of the factorial asymptotics of entropy\nfor canonical partition functions. Canonical ensemble have no such difficulties but the question arises of how\nlimiting correlations depend on the choice of the canonical ensemble.\nHere we give popular examples of empirical Gibbs families. In physics the pure (without matter fields)\nplanar quantum gravity (or string in dimension 0) is defined by the grand partition function\nX\nX\nP (T ) = Z \u22121 exp(\u2212\u03bcF (T )), Z =\nexp(\u2212\u03bcF (T )) =\nC(N ) exp(\u2212\u03bcN )\nT \u2208A\n\nN\n\nwhere the first sum is over all triangulations T of the sphere with N triangles, belonging to some class A of\ntriangulations. The exact definition of the class A is not essnetial, see [11], but leads however to different\nempirical distributions for different A. C(N ) = CA (N ) is called the entropy and equals the number of such\ntriangulations. It is known that\n7\nC(N ) \u223c aN \u2212 2 cN\nOne could also consider N to be the number of vertices of the dual graph, which is a 3-regular graph,\nimbedded in the two-dimensional sphere. Grand canonical ensemble is normally considered for \u03bc \u2192 \u03bccr + 0 =\n\u2212 log c. In the canonical ensemble one does not need the parameter \u03bc.\nLet us consider a triangulation with the root vertex 0 and fixed neighborhood Od (0) = \u0393d of radius d. Let\npN (\u0393d ) be its probability in our canonical ensemble.\nTheorem 2 There exists the limit lim pN (\u0393d ) = \u03c0(\u0393d ), which defines an empirical distribution.\nWe give the proof which uses explicit formulae.. Let \u0393d have u triangles and k edges on the boundary of\nthe neighborhood that is (that is edges with both vertices on the d-annulus). Let r(d, k, u) be the number of\nsuch neighborhoods. The external part is a triangulation of a disk with N \u2212 u triangles and k boundary edges.\nThe number D(N \u2212 u, k) of such triangulations (this follows from results by Tutte, see [11]) has the following\nasymptotics as N \u2192 \u221e\n5\n(14)\nD(N \u2212 u, k) \u223c \u03c6(k)N \u2212 2 cN \u2212u\n10\n\n\fThat is why the probability of \u0393d (at vertex 0) equals\n5\n\nN\n\nP (\u0393d ) \u223c P\n\nu,k\n\n\u03c6(k)N \u2212 2 cN \u2212u\nr(d, k, u)\u03c6(k)N\n\n\u2212 25\n\ncN \u2212u\n\n=P\n\n\u03c6(k)c\u2212u\n\u2212u\nu,k r(d, k, u)\u03c6(k)c\n\n(15)\n\nThe functions \u03c6, r and the constant c are known explicitely, but it is not important for us. As almost all graphs\nhave trivial automorphism group, it follows that the empirical limit is the same.\nNote that if instead of the sphere we would consider a surface of genus \u03c1, we would get another empirical\ndistribution, depending on \u03c1 and A.\nIs this empirical distribution (planar) a Gibbs empirical distribution? Two dimensional triangulations can be\nselected with the hard core potential \u03a6 such that \u03a6(O1 (v)) = \u221e, if O1 (v) 6= gk,k , k \u2265 2. However this does not\ndistinguish sphere and other two dimensional surfaces. That is why we have two possibilities. The firs one is to\nget triangulations of the sphere as a pure phase of some Gibbs family. We shall construct such an example later.\nSecond one is to consider nonlocal potentials (of infinite radius). The last characterization is well-known in\ngraph theory. Consider the potential \u03a6(K5 ) = \u03a6(K3,3 ) = \u221e, if K5 is a (not regular) subgraph, homeomorphic\nto the complete graph with 5 vertices, and K3,3 is a (not regular) subgraph, homeomorphic to the graph with\n6 vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and all edges (i, j), i = 1, 2, 3, j = 4, 5, 6 (by Pontriagin-Kuratowski theorem this selects\nplanar graphs). Put \u03a6 = 0 otherwise. Thus the planarity one should consider as some apriori condition of\nglobal character. Note however, that without topological restrictions we have an empirical Gibbs distribution.\n\n3\n\nEntropy\n\nFamous van Hove theorem in statistical physics says that the partition function grows exponentially with the\nvolume. In quantum gravity this result concerning the number of triangulation (we call it here entropy, not\nits logarithm) was a subject of many papers, see [12]. Only the case when the topology is fixed or subject\nto strong restrictions, was considered (see [13]). However, it is easy to see that the partition function grows\nfaster than exponentially even in the two dimensional case if the genus is not fixed. That is why the grand\ncanonical ensemble, as it is presented in physical papers, does not exist if canonical partition functions have\nsuperexponential growth. Double scaling limit is an (nonrigorous) attempt to overcome this difficulty.\nThus, the question about the entropy growth in the general is obvious interest. Below we shall give examples\nof subexponential (power) growth, where however there will be a phase transition. At the same time the number\npN\nof p-regular graphs with N vertices is of order N 2 . Note also that appending of the spin to a Gibbs graph\ncould influence only on the toipologies which are typical (that is add to maximal entropy only exponential\nfactor). That is it is useful to know rough (logarithmic) asymptotics of the entropy as well.\n\n3.1\n\nArbitrary genus in two dimensions\n\nThe asymptotics of the number of triangulations of a surface of fixed genus g is\nC(N, g) \u223c f (g)N ag+b cN , a =\n\n5\n5\n,b = \u2212 \u2212 1\n2\n2\n\n(16)\n\nwhere c does not depend on g. I am not aware of the formally written proof of this result, but it seems reasonable\nas it is confirmed by the results of [14] for other classes of maps, obtained by a direct by laborous development\nof Tutte's methods. Note that another method of reducing the problem to a matrix model, though gives the\nsame result but cannot be considered as a rigorous proof. Much more difficult is the case when the genus is not\nfixed. We give some first results in this direction, see also [15] where stronger results are obtained.\nWe give necessary definiyions from [16]. A map is a triple (S, G, \u03c6), where S is a closed oriented connected\ncompact two dimensional manifold, G is a connected graph, \u03c6 is a homeomorphic embedding of G in S, such\nthat the complement to \u03c6G is the union of connected open sets, each homeomorphic to an open disk. A rooted\nmap ia a map with one specified edge-end (that is an edge with one of its vertices) of G. Two rooted maps are\n(combinatorially) equiavalent if there exists an orientation respecting homeomorphism of S, which transforms\nthe vertices to the vertices, the edges to the edges, the root to the root. A combinatotrial map (further on\nsimply a map) is an equivalence class of maps. There exists an equivalent combinatorial definition of maps as\na cyclic (ribbon, fat) graph. Cyclic graph is a graph with given cyclic order of edge-ends in each vertex. It is\nbased on the following theorem, coming back to Edmonds.\nTheorem 3 For any connected cyclic graph there is a topologically unique imbedding in a surface so that the\norder of edge-ends becomes the clockwise ordering and the complement of the graph on the surface is a set of\ndisks.\n11\n\n\fThis theorem shows why the problem becomes solvable: it is reduced to simpler graph counting problem.\nIt is interesting to note that for 3-dim case the counting of complexes can be reduced to graphs only for\npseudomanifiolds.\nLet E be the set of edges, then 2E = E \u00d7 {\u22121, 1} - the set of edge-ends of the graph, vertices are defined by\na partition of 2E. Each block of the partition has a cyclic order of its elements, thus defining a permution P\non 2E. Another permutation, minus (\u2212), changes edge-ends of the same edge, i. e. 1 and \u22121. A face is defined\nby a sequence of edge-ends e, (\u2212)e, P (\u2212)e, (\u2212)P (\u2212)e, .... Thus, cycles of P are vertices, cycles of (\u2212) are edges\nand faces correspond to cycles of the permutation P (\u2212). This allows to give the following definition.\nDefinition 4 A combinatorial map is defined by a triple (2E, P, (\u2212)), consisting of the set 2E with even number\nof elements and two its permutations such that the group, generated by them is transitive on this set (this\ncorresponds to connectedness of G). It is assumed also, that the permutation (\u2212) consists of nonintersecting\ncycles of order 2. The root is a specified element of 2E.\nLet P\nFb,p (g) be the number of rooted maps with p + 1 vertices and b + p edges on the surface of genus g. Put\nFb,p = g Fb,p (g).\nTheorem 4 Let p(b) be a nondecreasing sequence of integers and such that\n\u03b1 < \u221e.

We shall consider pairs\n(T, \u03c6), where T is a finite rooted tree, \u03c6 is a mapping of the set vertices V (T ) of the tree to the positive\nquadrant of the plane, denote \u03c6(v) = (b = b(v), p = p(v)) for v \u2208 V (T ). Let \u03a6(b, p) be the set of all pairs\n(T, \u03c6), where the root corresponds to the point (b, p). Any such tree corresponds to some steps of iteration of\nthe recurrence (19). New vertex of the tree (we say that the new vertex is under some old vertex) corresponds\nto some iteration step: either we choose one of the terms in the right hand side of (19) or we stop for a given\n12\n\n\fvertex. Any vertex v = (b, p) of the tree (except the root) has one ingoing edge and 0, 1 or 2 outgoing edges, in\nthe latter case the vertex is called binary, then two other vertices of these two edges are in the points (k, j) and\n(b \u2212 k, p \u2212 j \u2212 1). Then we prescribe to this vertex the factor f (v) = k!(b\u2212k)!\n. If there is only one outgoing edge\nb!\nthen the vertex is called unary, in this case other vertex is in the point (b \u2212 1, p). Then the vertex v = (b, p) has\na factor f (v) = 2 + 2 pb . The vertex v = (b, p), from which there are no outgoing edges is called, is called final\nand has a factor f (v) = Gb,p . Contribution of the tree T we call the following product\nY\nf (v)\nf (T ) =\nv\u2208V (T )\n\nThe tree is called final if to each its final vertex corresponds the point (0, 0).\nLemma 6 The following expansion holds\nGb,p =\n\nX\n\nf (T )\n\nT\n\nwhere the summation is over all trees.\n\nThe proof is obtained by complete iteration of the recurrent equation (19), where we stop only when there\nwill not be any final vertices in the points different from (0, 0).\nNoteP\nthat the number of binary vertices in any tree with the root in (b, p) is not greater than p. In fact, put\np(T ) = p(v), where the sum is over all final vertices v of the tree T . Let the tree T \u2032 be obtained from T by\nappending two edges to some of some final vertex of the tree T . Then p(T \u2032 ) = p(T ) \u2212 1. If T \u2032 is obtained from\nT by appending one edge to some of some final vertex of the tree T , then p(T \u2032 ) = p(T ). The result follows.\nLemma 7 The numeber Kb,p of pairs (T, \u03c6), where T are complete trees with the root in (b, p), does not exceed\nC b+p for some constant C.\nProof. We have the following recurrent equation\nKb,p =\n\np\u22121\nb\nXX\n\nKk,j Kb\u2212k,p\u2212j\u22121 + Kb\u22121,p\n\nj=0 k=0\n\nThe equation for the generating function\nK = K(x, y) =\nis\n\nX\n\nKb,p xb y p\n\nK = xK 2 + yK + 1\nIt follows that\ny\u22121 y\u22121\nK=\u2212\n+\n2x\n2x\n\ns\n\n1\u2212\n\n4x\n(y \u2212 1)2\n\nFrom analyticity of K in the point x = y = 0 we get the result.\nBy the previous lemma it is sufficient to prove that for any pair (T, \u03c6) the contribution does not exceed\nC b+p for some constant C not depending on the pair. Some difficulty provides the estimate of the product of\n2p\nb in all unary pairs. Let us prove by induction that the number of unary vertices is not greater than b. Start\nwith the root vertex (b, p). Let between the root and the next binary vertex there is exactly b1 unary vertices.\nThe binary vertex (b \u2212 b1 , p) creates two other vertices (b\u2032 , p\u2032 ) and (b\u2032\u2032 , p\u2032\u2032 ) with b\u2032 + b\u2032\u2032 = b \u2212 b1 , p\u2032 + p\u2032\u2032 = p \u2212 1.\nBy induction under these two vertices there is not more than b\u2032 + b\u2032\u2032 unary vertices. That is why the general\nnumber of binary vertices does not exceed b\u2032 + b\u2032\u2032 + b1 = b.\nThere is a set V \u2032 of vertices with the following properties: 1) no vertex of V \u2032 is under some other vertex of\n\u2032\nV , 2) any vertex (b\u2032\u2032 , p\u2032\u2032 ), which is not under a vertex of V \u2032 , has the property that b\u2032\u2032 \u2265 2p\u2032\u2032 , 3) for any vertex\n(b\u2032 , p\u2032 ) from V \u2032 we have b\u2032 < 2p\u2032 .\nThe contribution of unary vertices of type 2) we shall estimate as 1. Take now some vertex of V \u2032 with\n\u2032\nb\u2032 < lnpp\u2032 . General number of unary vertices under it does not exceed b\u2032 and thus their contribution does not\np\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nexceed (2p\u2032 ) ln p\u2032 < C p .\nLet now lnpp \u2264 b < 2p for some vertex (b, p). Denote g(T ) = b!f (T ), if (b, p) is the root of T . If the root\n\u2032\nis a unary vertex wuth contribution 2p\nb , then g(T ) < 2pg(T ), as the vertex under it is (b \u2212 1, p). If the root\n13\n\n\f, then g(T ) = g(T1 )g(T2 ), where Ti are trees with roots (k, j) and\nis a binary vertex with contribution k!(b\u2212k)!\nb!\n(b \u2212 k, p \u2212 j \u2212 1) correspondingly, for some j. It follows that g(T ) < (2p)b and thus\nf (T ) <\n\n(2p)b\n< e2p\nb!\n\nP\nNote that v\u2032 \u2208V \u2032 p(v \u2032 ) \u2264 p, the reult follows.\nLet us finish the proof of the theorem. Consider the function of one complex variable\nf (z) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nz b+p(b) Gb,p(b)\n\nb=0\n\nBy the previous lemma this series has finite radius of convergence, say R. Then for any \u03b5 > 0 and b = b(\u03b5)\nsufficiently large, we have\n(R\u22121 \u2212 \u03b5)b < Gb,p(b) < (R\u22121 + \u03b5)b\nThe result follows.\nIt is useful to present the result of the theorem in a different way. Let \u03c1(M ) be the minimal genus where\nM can be inmedded and let M(b, p) be the set of maps with parameters b, p. Put \u03c1(b, p) = maxM\u2208M(b,p) \u03c1(M ).\n|M(b,p)|\nhas an exponential growth.\nThen the theorem says that (2\u03c1(b,p))!\nOtherwise speaking, the factorial factor has the order (\u2212\u03c7min )!, where \u03c7min is the minimum of Euler characteristics of possible manifolds.\nThis is seen from the formula\n\u2212\u03c7 = 2\u03c1 \u2212 2 = \u2212V + L \u2212 F = b \u2212 1 \u2212 F = \u2212z(P, \u2212) + b \u2212 1\nwhere z(P, \u2212) is the number of orbits of the group generated by both permutations. It is not difficult to see\nthat for given orbits of P one can always choose \u2212 so that the orbits of (P, \u2212) were as long as possible, that is\nz(P, \u2212) will give the contribution much less than b.\nThis result allows to suggest the following reasonable canonical distribution on the set A(b) of all maps M\nwith fixed b = \u2212\u03c7min\nPb (M ) = Zb\u22121 exp(\u2212\u03bcp(M ) \u2212 \u03bb\u03c1(M )) = Zb\u22121 exp(\u2212\u03bcp(M ) +\n\n\u03bb\nF (M ))\n2\n\nUnfortunately, there are no results concerning asymptotics of this partition function, but see [15].\n\n3.2\n\nDimension 3, 4\n\nIn quantuml gravity for a fixed triangulated d-dimensional manifold M (simplicial complex) the potential is\nlinear in the numbers Ni (T ) of i-dimensional simplices of the triangulation T, i = 0, ..., d, that is the pratition\nfunctions is formally\nX\nX\nX\nX\nki Ni )C({Ni })\nexp(\u2212\nki Ni (T )) =\nZ=\nexp(\u2212\ni\n\nT\n\n{Ni }\n\ni\n\nwhere C({Ni }) is the number of triangulation with given numbers C({Ni }). From Dehn-Sommerfeld relations\n(see [12]) it follows that only two of Ni (T ) are linearly independent. That is why the distribution can be written\nas follows\nX\nexp(\u2212\u03bbd Nd (T ) + \u03bbd\u22122 Nd\u22122 (T ))\nT\n\nwhere the sum is over all triangulations T of the given manifold. Moreover the latter formula corresponds to\nthe Hilbert-Eisnstein action\nZ\n1\n\u221a\nS=\ndx g(2\u039b \u2212 R)\n16\u03c0G\n\nwhere R is the scalar curvature, \u039b is the cosmological constant, G is the Newton constant. For the convergence\nof the latter series at least for some parameters one needs exponential estimates on C({Ni }). Discussion of\nnecessary exponential estimates see in [12]. D. Boulatov [13] gives the following result. Let C(N, M) be the\nnumber of three dimensional triangulations with N simplices of the three dimensional manifold M. Then\nX\nC(N, M) < C exp(\u03b3N )\n\nwhere the sum is over all M with fixed homology group H1 (M, Z), \u03b3 = \u03b3(H1 (M, Z)).\n14\n\n\fIn the general case (arbitrary topology) the growth is not exponential, and Gibbs families provide the unique\npossibility to introduce a probability distribution.\nTo each d-dimansional simplicial complex there corresponds a dual graph, vertices of which are in one-to-one\ncorrespondence with d-simplices. Each vertex of this graph has d edge-ends (legs), which correpond to to d\nof its (d \u2212 1)-dimensional faces. Coupling of edge-ends corresponds to glueing of the correponding faces with\nlinear mappings. In dimansion 2 one gets a manifold for any way of coupling. In larger dimensions we get\npseudomanifolds with probability tending to 1. Moreover, in the thermodynamic limit this pseudomanifold does\nnot have any vertex with a neighborhood isomorphic to a ball. This follows from results of the section 4.4\nThe condition selecting manifolds among the pseudomanifolds is local and can be given by a superlocal\npotential (with hard core). However restrictions on topology are not local in general. However, below we\nconsider examples where restrictions on topology will be a corollary of the Gibbs property.\n\n4\n\nPhase Transitions\n(0)\n\nGibbs family (on A\u221e or on A\u221e ) with potential \u03a6 is called a pure Gibbs family if it is not a convex combination\nof other Gibbas families with the same potential. Thus, nonuniqueness of for Gibbs families means that there at\nleast two pure Gibbs families with the same potential \u03a6. Pure Gibbs state can be can be of two kinds: either it\nhas the support on the set configurations on one fixed graph or it has the support on several or even continuum\ndifferent graphs. In the fisrt case it reduces of course to a Gibbs field.\nAccordingly to this nonuniqueness can be of quite different nature. Firstly, on each graph of the support of\nthe Gibbs family the pure phases can differ with the structure of typical configurations (this is a phase transition\ninherited from Gibbs fields a fixed graph). Secondly, pure phases can differ with the typical structure of the\ngraph itself (metrical or topological phase transition). Heuristically speaking, topological phase transition takes\nplace when there are at least two Gibbs families with non-intersecting supports, and these supports have typical\ngraphs with quite different topological properties (or quite different local structure, defining the topology).\nDescription of all phases is sufficiently complicated even for simple examples. It is simpler to select some\nphases, we do this below for some examples. The following remark will be useful: if a pure Gibbs field is a\nGibbs family then it is a pure Gibbs family.\n\n4.1\n\nMean-field model\n\nIn discrete quantum gravity there is a simple model [19], which is explicitely (and rigorously) solvable, where\ndifferent phases roughly correspond to numerical modelling of more complicated models with spin. This is an\nurn model with M = \u03bbN balls in N urns. It can be interpreted as a random graph, if one calls urns vertices\nand balls edge-ends. After this edge-ends are coupled in pairs. Thus, there are N labelled (enumerated) vertices\ni = 1, ..., N , with qi \u2265 1 edge-ends of a vertex i. Canonical ensemble is given by the partition function\nZN =\n\nX\n\n{qi }:\n\nP\n\nexp(\u2212\n\nqi =M\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03b2\u03a6(qi ))\n\ni=1\n\nNote that in our terminology\nthis is a model with a local potential (not stable, as it was shown above) and\nP\nnonlocal restriction qi = M = \u03bbN of the mean field type. This restriction restores stability for such potentials.\nNote that the factorial factor A(M ) in the asymptotics of the partition function, which is responsible for random\ncoupling of edge-ends can be factorized, after what the asymptotics looks as follows\nZN = cN \u03b1 exp(\u03b3N )\nFor sufficiently wide class of potentials, including \u03a6(q) = log q, there are two phases with a phase transition\nin \u03bb, for fixed \u03b2. One phase (elongated, fluid) for small densities, where the balls are uniformly distributed\nin the urns, the secodn one (crumpled, Bose-Einstein) phase, where in one only vertex the number of balls is\nabout M balls. With some modification of the model one can get a mixed phase (condensed, crinkled), where\nthere is one vertex with cM, c < 1, balls, the other urns are uniformly filled up.\nNumerical modelling, see [20], shows the appearance of similar phases in two-dimensional gravity with spins.\nThat is why various explanations and analogs are of interest. As we already said, in fact this is not more than a\nsmoothed transition between stability and instability of the potential, the smoothing being realised by a mean\nfield type restriction.\nIn statistical physics the analog is the Bose-Einstein condensation. In informatics the choice \u03a6 = cq gives\nthe stationary distribution in Jackson networks in the mean field model, see [21], where quite similar phase\ntransition were observed. All classical theory of random graphs deals in fact with the chemical potential with\nthe same mean field type restriction, see [22].\n15\n\n\f4.2\n\nPhase transition with boundaries\n\nWe consider triangulations T of a two-dimensional sphere with k holes, called quasitriangulations in [43] and\ntriagulation in [11]. These maps consist of vertices, edges and faces-triangles (that is having three smooth sides),\nbut are not assumed to be an abstract simplicial complex. For example, several edges can connect two vertices.\nLet V (T ) (L(T )) be the set of vertices (edges) in T , L(T ) includes the boundary edges.\nLet T (\u03c1, N, k; m1 , ..., mk ) be the set of all such (combinatorial) triangulations with N triangles and mi \u2265 2\nedges on the boundary of the hole i = 1, ..., k. Assume that mi \u2265 2. Let C(\u03c1, N ; m1 , ..., mk ) be the number of\nsuch triangulations. For fixed \u03c1, k and given N define the distribution \u03bc\u03c1,N,k (canonical ensemble) on the set\nT (\u03c1, N, k) = \u222am1 ,...,mk T (\u03c1, N, k; m1 , ..., mk )\nof triangulations. One can introduce T (\u03c1, N, k) in four equivalent (easy to verify) ways:\n\u2022 interaction is proportional to the general number of edges, that is\n\u22121\n\u03bc\u03c1,N,k (T ) = ZN\nexp(\u2212\u03bc1 L(T ))\n\nwhere L(T ) is the number of edges of T , including all boundary edges;\n\u2022 interaction is proportional to the sum of of degrees of vertices\n\u03bc X\ndeg v)\nexp(\u2212\u03bc1 L(T )) = exp(\u2212 1\n2\nv\u2208V (T )\n\nThus\nZN = ZN (\u03c1, k) =\n\nX\n\nX\n\nexp(\u2212\n\n(m1 ,...,mk ) T \u2208T (\u03c1,N ;m1 ,...,mk )\n\n\u03bc1\n2\n\nX\n\ndeg v)\n\nv\u2208V (T )\n\nUsing a duscrete analog of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, one can show that this is a discrete analog of\nEinstein-Hilbert action.

We need the following lemma\nLemma 8 C(N, m) \u223c m\u22121 C0 (N, m) as N, m \u2192 \u221e.\nProof of the lemma. Let us enumerate the edges of the boundary 1, 2, ..., m in the cyclic order, starting from\nthe root edge. Automorphis \u03c6 of the triangulation of the disk is uniquely defined if an edge j = \u03c6(1) is given, to\nwhich the edge 1 is mapped. In fact, then all adjacent to the edge 1 triangles are mapped by \u03c6 to the triangles\nadjacent to j, and so on by connectedness.\nConsider the strip of width 1, adjacent to the boundary, that is the set of triangles of three types: those\nwhich have a common edge with the boundary (type 1), two common adjacent edges (type 2) and those,\nhaving with the boundary only a common vertex (type 0). Thus the strip can be identified with the word\n\u03b1 = x1 ...xn , n > m, where xi = 0, 1, 2. Consider the set W (m, n0 , n1 , n2 ) of words with given m and numbers ni\nof i = 0, 1, 2. An automorphism of a disk gives a cyclic automorphism of the word \u03b1. The sets W (m, n0 , n1 , n2 )\nare invariant however. Note that\nm = n1 + 2n2\nand the length of other boundary of the strip equals m\u2032 = n0 . Thus, if there is no nontrivial automorphism of\nthe word, then there are no automorphisms of the whole triangulation of the disk. It is easy to see, that for a\ngiven n0 and as m \u2192 \u221e the set of words from \u222an1 ,n2 W (m, n0 , n1 , n2 ), having nontrivial cyclic automorphisms,\nis small compared with the number of words |\u222an1 ,n2 W (m, n0 , n1 , n2 )|..\n1\n1\ninstead of 1 + m\nin the previous case.

Topological field theory (TFT) usually is introduced axiomatically using the category theory\n[39], heuristically (using path integrals from quantum field theory) or algebraically (as Frobenius algebras). to\ngive sense to the path integral the idea of discretization, see for example [40, 42, 41], seems quite natural. In\nthe last chapter of [46] TFT is constructed, which satisfies all axioms already for finite triangulations. However,\nit is possible that for some cases the axioms can be satisfied only in the limit N \u2192 \u221e. Moreover, such limit\nis interesting in itself, and little is known about it. Here we consider this problem for two boundaries (that is\nk = 2), zero genus and large \u03bc1 in the previous model. It is interesting that we get a nontrivial joint distribution\nof the lengths of the boundaries.\nTheorem 8 For k = 2, sufficiently large \u03bc1 and fixed m1 , m2 there exist correlation functions P0,2 (m1 , m2 ) =\nlimN PN,0,2 (m1 , m2 ).\nWe give a complete proof, similar method seems to work for any k and \u03c1. The following recurrent relations\nfor C0 (N, m, m2 ), m = m1 hold\nC0 (N, m, m2 ) = C0 (N \u2212 1, m + 1, m2 ) + C0 (N \u2212 1, m + m2 + 1)+\nX\nX\n+\nC0 (N1 , k1 , m2 )C0 (N2 , k2 )\nN1 +N2 =N \u22121 k1 +k2 =m+1\n\nThey can be obtained as in Tutte's method [44] by deletion of the rooted edge. See Figure ???\nAfter deletion three cases are possible which correspond to three terms in the right hand side of the recurrent\nrelation: graph has still two holes but the first one (where the root is) the length increases but the number of\ntriangles decreases, two holes become one, the graph becomes not connected. The boundary conditions are as\nfollows. For given N only finite number of terms C0 (N, m, m2 ) 6= 0, it is convenient to consider C0 (N, m, m2 )\nknown for N < N0 , their explicit expression does not interest us. Moreover, C0 (N, m, m2 ) = 0, if either m < 2\nor m2 < 2.\nLemma 9 The asymptotics as N \u2192 \u221e and fixed m, m1\n5\n\nC0 (N, m, m2 ) \u223c \u03c6(m, m2 )N \u2212 2 +1 cN\n\n(21)\n\nMoreover \u03c6(m, 3) = \u03c6(m).\nProof.

To get a triangulation from\nT (0, N ; m, 3) take a triangulation from T (0, N + 1; m) and choose one of N triangles so that it did not touch\nthe boundary, this can be done in N \u2212 O(m) ways. It follows that C0 (N, m, 3) \u223c C0 (N + 1, m)N , and thus\n\u03c6(m, 3) = c\u03c6(m). Forgetting the root on the boundary m and putting it on the boundary of length 3, we have\nfrom triviality of the automorphism group fro almost all graphs that \u03c6(3, m) = 3c\nm \u03c6(m). To get a triangulation\nfrom T (0, N ; m, 2) take a triangulation from T (0, N ; m), choose one of its N triangles so that it did not touch the\n3\nboundary, take one of its edges and double it. That is why \u03c6(m, 2) = 23 \u03c6(m) and similarly \u03c6(2, m) = m\n\u03c6(m).\nRewrite the recurrent relations as follows\nX\nX\nC0 (N \u2212 1, m + 1, m2 ) = C0 (N, m, m2 ) \u2212\nC0 (N1 , k1 , m2 )C0 (N2 , k2 )+\nN1 +N2 =N \u22121 k1 +k2 =m+1\n\n19\n\n\f\u2212C0 (N \u2212 1, m + m2 + 1)\nAs far as we know C0 (N, m, 2), C0 (N, m, 3) and C0 (N, 2, m2 ), C0 (N, 3, m2 ), the result follows by induction in\n5\nm for fixed m2 and vice versa. In fact, multiply the latter relation on c\u2212N +1 (N \u2212 1) 2 \u22121 .

If there is no spin then the\nentropy has a subexponential growth.\nConsider\na Gibbs families with S = {\u22121, 1} and potential \u03a6, equal to the sum of \u03a6Ud,2 and the Ising potential\nP\n\u03a6Is = <i,j> \u03c3 i \u03c3 j of nearest neighbor interaction.\nTheorem 9 For any \u03b2 there exists infinite number of pure Gibbs families with potential \u03a6, that are Gibbs fields\non fixed graphs (cylinders).\n\nProof. We shall construct for sufficiently large N the finite Gibbs family with boundary conditions, defined\nby the graph \u03b3 N , which is constructed as follows. Consider the subgraph \u03b1n of the graph Z 2 - the strip,\nconsisting of points (i, j), i \u2208 Z; j = \u2212n, ..., n, n \u2265 2, with root (0, 0). The points (i, \u2212n) and (i, n) identified.\nDefine the distance of the point (i, n) to (0, 0) as |i| + |n|. Put \u03b3 N = \u03b3(\u03b1n , (0, 0); N + 1, N + 3). If n \u226a N ,\nthen \u03b3 N consists of two isomorphic connected components. We will use lemma 2, assuming that \u03bd N is the unit\nmeasure on the spin graph \u03b3 N , taking all spins on \u03b3 N equal to 1. We shall prove that finite Gibbs family on\n(0)\nGN is the Gibbs (Ising) measure on the graph \u03b3(\u03b1n , (0, 0); 0, N ).\nTo prove this it is convenient to start from the case when S is trivial, using only part \u03a6Ud,2 of the potential \u03a6.\nProve that the finite Gibbs family with the defined boundary conditions is a unit measure on \u03b3(\u03b1n , (0, 0); 0, N ),\nthat is the random graph G coincides a.s. with the graph \u03b3(\u03b1n , (0, 0); 0, N ). We shall use the method of \"analitical\" continuation, consisting in the inductive proof of the coincidence of the slice \u03b3(N ) = \u03b3(G, 0; N, N ), \u03b3(N \u22121)\netc. of the random graph G coincide with the correponding annuli of the graph \u03b1n . We use double induction.\nConstruct first the annulus \u03b3(N ) and prove that it is unique and coincides with the corresponding annulus\n\u03b3(\u03b1n , (0, 0); N, N ) of the graph \u03b1n .\nConsider the point (N + 2, 0) in \u03b3 N and its 2-neighborhood in \u03b3 N . This neighborhood lacks one edge l0\nfrom the point (N + 1, 0) with the new vertex v0 , which we denote (N, 0). The latter vertex should be on the\ndistance N from the origin as all point on distances N + 1, N + 2; N + 3 are already fixed.\nConsider now the point (N + 1, 1). From the geometry of its neighborhood in \u03b3(\u03b1n , (0, 0); N + 1, N + 3) it\nfollows that from the point (N, 1) \u2208 \u03b3(\u03b1n ; N + 1, N + 3) there should be two new edges l1 , l2 connecting it with\nthe slice (annulus) N . Moreover, one of these edges should be connected with the vertex v0 .\n20\n\n\fFurthe by induction we construct all slice \u03b3(N ) (and only this slice), starting with points with positive first\ncoordinate and then symmetric ones. All points of the slice \u03b3(N + 2) will get necessary neighborhoods and one\ncan exclude them from further considerations.\nFurther on by induction in slices we construct slices \u03b3(N \u2212 1), \u03b3(N \u2212 2), ... , using the neighborhoods\nof the already constructed slices N + 1, \u2212N \u2212 1, N, \u2212N, .... We continue this induction until both connected\ncomponents become one. Let us prove that this event will occur on the line y = \u00b1n on slice n. We should\nexclude two other possibilities: the first one - that this will occur on another line, second o,e - that it will occur\non the line y = \u00b1n, but on a slice different from n. The second possibility can be excluded with the following\narguments. After murging of the two connected components on the line y = \u00b1n we will have a hol which should\nbe filled in for exactly n steps of the induction. That is why the murging should occur on the slice n. The first\npossibility is excluded as follows. Assume that the murging occured on the line y = k. Then the line y = k + 1\non this step will have on the same inductive step an obstruction to filling it in.\nThus, we see that for any choice of the spins on \u03b3 N the Gibbs family has a support on the unique graph,\nthus thois Gibbs family is a Gibbs field. Theorem is proved as n was arbitrary.\n\n4.4\n4.4.1\n\nGibbs characterization of structures\nUniqueness for high entropy case\n\nCountable trees cannot be characterized locally, that is they cannot be selected from the class of all graphs using\nsome restrictions on subgraphs with diameter less than some constant. It is interesting however, that a local\ncharacterization (understood probabilistically) can be given using Gibbs families with local potentials. More\nexactly, one can define Gibbs families with potential of diameter 2, which have support on the set of countable\ntress. We consider here the case of p-regular trees. Moreover, this will give us an example when the partition\nfunction has factorial growth but the corresponding Gibbs family is unique.\nConsider the set AN,p of all p-regular graphs with N vertices, that is graphs where all vertices have degree\np \u2265 3. Consider first the finite Gibbs family on AN with the following superpotential \u03a6 : \u03a6 = 0 on graphs of\nradius 1, if 0 has degree p, and \u03a6 = \u221e for all other graphs of diameter 1. One can say also that we consider\nthe Gibbs family \u03bcN on AN,p with the potential \u03a6 \u2261 0.\nTheorem 10 lim pN (\u0393k ) = p(\u0393k ) = 1 , if \u0393k is any p-regular, where each path from 0 to a final vertex has\nlength k, and 0 for other \u0393k .\nProof. Note that all graphs from AN,p have equal probability with respect to the measure \u03bcN , that reduces\nthe problem to the classical theory of random graphs, see [22]. The combinatorial method to prove this theorem\nconsists of several steps.\n1. Let us call a graph enumerated, if its vertices are enumerated. Let LN (p) be the number of enumerated\np-regular graphs with N vertices. This number is equal to, see theorem II.16 in [22],\nLN (p) \u223c C(p)\n\n(pN \u2212 1)(pN \u2212 3)...\n(p!)N\n\nwhere C(p) is some constant, which is known explicitely but we do not need it. Similarly for fixed\np, k, d1 , ..., dk let LN (p; d1 , ..., dk ) be the number of enumerated graphs with where some N \u2212 k vertices\nhave degree p and other N \u2212 k vertices have degrees d1 , ..., dk correspondingly. It is equal to, see also\ntheorem II.16 in [22],\nLN (p; d1 , ..., dk ) \u223c C(p, k; d1 , ..., dk )\n\n(2m \u2212 1)(2m \u2212 3)...\n(p!)N\n\nwhere C(p, k; d1 , ..., dk ) is a constant and 2m = p(N \u2212 k) + d1 + ... + dk .\n2. Prove that the probability that the neighborhood O1 (v) of some vertex (for example, of the vertex 1) does\nnot have cycles, tends to zero as N \u2192 \u221e. The number of graphs such that O1 (v) does not contain cycles\nis equal to LN \u22121 (p; d1 , ..., dp )(N \u2212 1)...(N \u2212 p) with d1 = ... = dp = p \u2212 1. At the same time the number\nof graphs such that O1 (v) contains one cycle, that is there is an additional edge, say between edges 1 and\n2, is equal to LN \u22121 (p; e1 , ..., ep )(N \u2212 1)...(N \u2212 p), where d1 = d2 = p \u2212 2, d3 = ... = dp = p \u2212 1. It is easy\nto see that\nLN \u22121 (p; e1 , ..., ep )\n\u21920\nLN \u22121 (p; d1 , ..., dp )\nas N \u2192 \u221e.\n21\n\n\f3. It follows that the mean number of vertices v with neighborhoods O1 (v) without cycles is of order o(N ).\nBut as almost all p-regular graphs do not have nontrivial automorphisms (theorem IX.7 [22]), then the\nsame result holds for non enumerated graphs.\n4. Neighborhoods or larger radius are considered similarly.\nLet us do an important remark: it is not true that for a given N the probability for the graph in AN,p to\nbe a tree, is close to 1. Moreover, this probability tends to 0 as N \u2192 \u221e. Nontrivial topology (cycles) appears\non a larger scale: typical length of cycles tends to \u221e as N \u2192 \u221e, see below.\nRemark 4 If the set S is finite, but the interaction is trivial, gives an independent fields on the p-regular tree.\nThe question is what will be if there an additional nontrivial interaction between spins.\n4.4.2\n\nGibbs varieties of groups\n\nBeside the trees, Gibbs families allow to select other mathematical objects, which do not have a local characterization. WE consider the cases when after the limit a.s. we get an algebraic object - a group.\nConsider the class HN,2p 2p\u2212regular graphs with a local structure, where all edge-ends of each vertex are\nenumerated by symbols a1 , ...ap , a1\u22121 , ...ap\u22121 . Moreover, if to one end of an edge there corresponds say ai , then\nto the other end there corresponds ai\u22121 , and vice-versa. This class can be selected from the class AN with\nthe local potential \u03a6 on edges, equal 0, if the edge-ends have symbols ai , a\u22121\ni , and \u221e otherwise, and also by\nthe superlocal potential \u03a61 on neighborhoods of radius 1, equal 0 only if the vertex has degree 2p and all its\nedge-ends are enumerated by different symbols.\nIn particular, Cayley diagrams of countable groups, see [18], belong to this class of graphs with a local\nstructure. The graph of the group with finite number of generators a1 , ...ap and finite number of defining\nrelations \u03b11 = ... = \u03b1n = 1, where \u03b11 , ..., \u03b1n are some words, is selected by the following nonlocal condition:\nany cycle in the graph is generated by \u03b11 , ..., \u03b1n , and vice versa (note that to each path on the graph corresponds\na word, that is an elemnet of the group). The free noncommutative group corresponds to the case n = 0, that\nis when there are npo defining relations.\n(0)\n\nTheorem 11 Limiting Gibbs family on A\u221e with potential \u03a6 + \u03a61 has the support on the tree corresponding\nto the free group with n generators.\nWe do not give proof here, but note that it differs from the previous proof for p-regular graphs only in that\nthe set edge-ends is subdivided on 2p subsets A(ai ), A(ai\u22121 ), and the freedom of coupling edge-ends is restricted\nonly by that edge-ends, for example A(ai ), can be coupled only with edge-ends from A(a\u22121\ni ).\nThis result possibly allows wide generalizations. Consider the set HN,2p (\u03b11 , ..., \u03b1n ) of graphs, corresponding\nto groups from a manifold of groups, defined by relations \u03b11 = ... = \u03b1n = 1 (and possibly others as well). Then\nthe limiting Gibbs families has its support on the free with respect to this manifold groups (that is having only\nreltions \u03b11 = ... = \u03b1n = 1), as the creation of additional short cycles have small probability. Such results can\nplay role in physics explaining how nonlocal objects can appear with great probability from local conditions.\n\n4.5\n\nScales\n\nHere we shortly say about an important generalization, that allows to go out of the framework of the thermodynamic limit which only leads to limiting Gibbs families.\nLet Gibbs families \u03bcN on the sets BN of finite graphs with a local structure be given, where N is some\nparameter as the number of vertices, edges, radius etc. They induce measures \u03bd N on the corresponding subsets\nGN of finite graphs. Let a nondecreasing function f : Z+ \u2192 R+ be given. Define the macrodimension of a\nrandom (with respect to the sequence \u03bd N ) finite graph on the scale f (N ). Let Of (N ) (v) be the neighborhood\nof v of radius f (N ). Put\nX log Of (N ) (v)\n1\n>\u03bd N\nDN (f ) =<\n|V (G)|\nlog f (N )\nv\u2208V (G)\n\nIf there exists the limit limN \u2192\u221e DN (f ) = D(f ), then D(f ) is called the macrodimension on the scale f .\nOne can define the corresponding invariant for limiting Gibbs families, using the limit N \u2192 \u221e. See, for\nexample, the definition of the macrodimension of a countable complex in [47]. Such definition however is only a\nparticular case, it corresponds to the minimal scale f , where f (N ) tends to infinity with N but as slower than\nany othe fixed sclae.\n\n22\n\n\fSimilarly one can define other topological characteristics on different scales. Let BN = AN , that is V (G) =\nN . For example, let h(Od (v)) be the number of independent cycles in the d-neighborhood of the vertex v. The\nexponent for the number of independent cycles on the scale f is defined as follows, if the following limit exists,\nX h(Of (N ) (v))\n1\n>\n<\nN \u2192\u221e N\nOf (N ) (v)\nv\n\nb(f ) = lim\n\nProposition 4 Under the conditions of theorem 10 b(f ) = 0 for any scale f (N ) \u2264 (1 \u2212 \u03b5) logp\u22121 N , where\n\u03b5 > 0 is arbitrary, and is equal to p2 \u2212 1 for any scale f (N ) \u2265 (1 + \u03b5) logp\u22121 N .\nProof. Consider the neighborhood O(1\u2212\u03b5) logp\u22121 N (v) of some vertex v. In this neighborhood there is not\nmore than (p \u2212 1)(1\u2212\u03b5) logp\u22121 N = N 1\u2212\u03b5 vertices. An edge outgoing from these vertices is incident to another\nvertex of this neighborhood with probability not greater than N \u2212\u03b5 . Then the number of such edges does not\nexceed N \u2212\u03b5 pN 1\u2212\u03b5 = pN 1\u22122\u03b5 . Any such edge cannot create more than one new cycle. The first statement\nfollows from this.\nTo prove the second statement denote D(N ) the diameter of the random graph. It is known [22], that fro\nany \u03b5 > 0\nD(N )\nPN (1 \u2212 \u03b5 <\n< 1 + \u03b5) \u2192N \u2192\u221e 0\nlogp\u22121 N\nIn all graph the number of independent cycles is ( p2 \u2212 1)N \u2212 1, that follows from Euler formula V \u2212 L + M = 1,\nwhere M is the number of independent cycles. Then M = L \u2212 V = pN\n2 \u2212 N.\n\n4.6\n\nOn discrete quantum gravity\n\nHere it is natural to say some words about main directions of research in discrete quantum gravity. The question\n\"What is quantum gravity?\" has no exact formulation. There are many attempts to formulate and solve this\nproblem (however, an extreme optimism in some physical papers always changed with more moderate attitude).\nAs we will see now, most approaches has much in common with the scheme developed in this paper. However,\nthe main unsolved difficulty, not mentioning the necessity of fundamental ideas, consists in concretization of\nthe model, following numerous physical requirements, which are unclear as well.\nPhysicists claim that the so called standard model satisfies practical needs, thus describing all interactions\n(electromagnetic, weak, strong), except gravity. Although the standard model does not still exist in space-time\ndimension 4 from the point of view of constructive quantum field theory (that is from the standard point of view\non mathematical rigor, it seems to admit at least exactly formulated definitions and assertions-hypothesis. They\ncan be given either generalizing Wightman axioms or as scaling limits of lattice approximations. However, in all\nattempts to construct unified theory, including gravity, even exact hypothesis are lacking. What exists now are\nsome pieces of \"future theory\", based on different physical, methodological and even philosophical principles. I\nwill try to give some classification of them, staying in a mathemical background.\nNote first, that no ways are known now for direct generalizations of Wightman axioms or, in euclidean\napproach, Osterwalder-Schrader axioms (although, axioms of S-matrix type can be generalized in different\ndirections - topological field theory, diagrams of string theory). Main underlying conceipts of these axioms are\nbased on the classical and fixed space-time. For example, locality uses Minkowski metrics, and unitarity - the\nmere existence of classical time. If, in the framework of Wightman axioms one adds the metrics as a new field,\nthen it will not be (as the experience in constructive field theory shows) continuous function, that can change\ntopology locally, making the conceipt of locality unclear. One says then that metrics quantization leads to\nspace-time quantization.\nLattice approximation is a more convenient object for generalization. In fact, all existing theories allow\ndiscrete approximation. For example, euclidean field theory (restricting to boson fields for simplicity) considers\nd\nthe lattice Z\u03b5d with step \u03b5, volume \u039b = [\u2212N, N ] \u2282 Rd , fields \u03c6(x) \u2208 Rm , x \u2208 Z\u03b5d , and the partition function\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nY Z\nX\nZ\u039b,\u03b5 = \uf8f0\nd\u03c6(x)\uf8fb exp(\u2212\n\u03a6(\u03c6(x), \u03c6(x\u2032 ); \u03b5))\nx\u2208\u039b\u2229Z\u03b5d\n\nRm\n\n<x,x\u2032 >\n\nwhere x, x\u2032 is any pair of nearest neighbors in \u039b \u2229 Z\u03b5d , \u03a6 is a real function on Rm \u00d7 Rm , depending also on a\nparameter \u03b5. Main mathematical problem is the existence of some scaling limits as \u03b5 \u2192 0.\nIn this paper we can only touch different directions for constructing discrete models. We show that they\nare Gibbs families by explicitely indicating the classes of graphs with a local structure and the potential. Wide\nphysical reviews of different directions in quantum gravity see in [23, 24, 25].\n23\n\n\fIt is important to note that most theories listed below try to quantize metrics but not topology, as the\nconsidered class of graphs is related to one fixed manifold or with some class of manifolds of rather restricted\ntopology. Thus, a part of the theory seems to be the same for all existing discrete theories, and the theory of\nGibbs families seems to be necessary.\nRegge theory Chronologically this is the earliest (see [26]) discrete alternative to classical general relativity.\nAs compared to more recent dynamical triangulation model, where the lengths of edges are considered to be\nequal, they are arbitrary in Regge theory. Let us fix a triangulation T of a smooth manifold M of dimension\nd and let Sk (T ), k = 0, ..., d, be the set of all k-simplices of the triangulation T . Let li be the length of edge\ni \u2208 S1 (T ) and L(T ) = {li , i \u2208 S1 (T )} be the set of vectors of lengths, such that on each simplex they define\na positive definite euclidean metrics. Thus in euclidean approach li are random variables, satisfying some\ninequalities, that makes the free measure more complicated. The partition function is defined to be\nX\nX\nX\nv(\u2206)\nv(B)\u03b5(B) + \u03bc\nexp(\u2212S(T ))d\u039b(T ), S(T ) = \u03bb\nZN =\n\u2206\u2208Sd (T )\n\nB\u2208Sd\u22122 (T )\n\nT :|T |=N\n\nQ\n\nwhere d\u039b(T ) is the restriction of the measure i\u2208S1 (T ) dli on L(T ), v(.) is the volume, \u03b5(B) is the defect angle\nof the (d \u2212 2)-dimensional face B, which we will not define here (see [26]). They can be expressed in terms of li .\nDynamical triangulations This is possibly the domain most rich in results. It appeared in the string\ntheory community. Note that, out of all directions in quantum gravity, only string theory includes the standard\nmodel and tries to get numbers from the theory. Although string theory follows tightly the formal techniques\nof quantum field theory, there is no question about axioms. String theory has more calculational goals (to\ncalculate string diagrams) than analysis of fundamentals of our knowledge about space-time.\nDiscrete string in euclidean approach is a Gibbs family on some subsets AN of the set \u222a\u03c1,k AN (\u03c1, k) of\ntriangulations T of surfaces of genus \u03c1 with k holes. On each triangle i there is a spin \u03c3 i taking values in Rd .\nOften AN is taken to be AN = AN (0, 0) or \u222a\u03c1 AN (\u03c1, 0). The canonical partition function is\nXZ\nY\nX\nZN =\n(\u03c3 i \u2212 \u03c3 j )2 )\nd\u03c3 i\nexp(\u2212\u03bb\u03c1(T ) \u2212\nT\n\nAN\n\n<i,j>\n\ni\u2208T\n\nNondiscrete approaches to string theory has more popularity. For example, the spectrum of the free boson\nstring can be found explicitely via the hamiltonian approach, but this is not yet done (and seems to be difficult)\nin the dynamical triangulation approach. This enigmatic fact shows that relations between different approaches\nto physically the same object can be very subtle.\nMatrix theories Matrix models are can be used for counting maps (and more complicated objects) on\nsurfaces. Smooth map is a triple (S, G, \u03c6), where S is a smooth compact oriented surface, G is a connected\ngraph (one-dimensional complex), \u03c6 : G \u2192 S is an embedding such that the images of the edges of G are smooth\narcs, and the complement S\\\u03c6(G) is a union of domains homeomorphic to disks. A map (or combinatorial map)\nis an equivalence class of smooth maps. Two maps (S1 , G1 , \u03c61 ), (S2 , G2 , \u03c62 ) are called equivalent if there exists a\nhomeomorphism f : S1 \u2192 S2 such that mappings f : \u03c61 (V (G1 )) \u2192 \u03c62 (V (G2 )) and f : \u03c61 (L(G1 )) \u2192 \u03c62 (L(G2 ))\nare one-to-one.\nOne of the central models of matrix theory is the following probability distribution \u03bc on the set of selfadjoint\nn \u00d7 n-matrices \u03c6 = (\u03c6ij ) with the density\nd\u03bc\n\u03c62\n= Z \u22121 exp(\u2212tr( ) \u2212 tr(V ))\nd\u03bd\n2h\nP\nwhere V =\nak \u03c6k is a polynomial of \u03c6, bounded from below, \u03bd is the Lebesgue measure on the real n2 diumensional space of vectors (\u03c6ii , Re \u03c6ij , Im \u03c6ij , i < j). If V = 0, then the measure \u03bc = \u03bc0 is gaussian with\ncovariances \u03c6ij , \u03c6\u2217kl = \u03c6ij , \u03c6lk = h\u03b4 ik \u03b4 jl . The density of \u03bc with respect to \u03bc0 is equal to\nd\u03bc\n= Z0\u22121 exp(\u2212tr(V ))\nd\u03bc0\nFor the existence of \u03bc it is necessary that the degree p of the polynomial V were even and the coefficient ap\nwere positive. For this case there is a deep theory of such models, see [32].\n\n24\n\n\fi\n\ni\n\nl\n\nj\nj\n\nl\n\nk\nk\nFigure 2: Vertex of a ribbon graph\n\nFundamental connection (originated by Hooft) between matrix models and counting problems for maps on\nsurfaces is given by the formal series in semiinvariants or in diagrams (see for example [31])\nlog Z =\n\n\u221e\nX\n(\u22121)k\nk=1\n\nk!\n\n< tr(V ), ..., tr(V ) >=\n\n\u221e\nX\n(\u22121)k X\n\nk=1\n\nk!\n\nI(Dk )\n\nDk\n\nP\nwhere Dk is the sum over all connected diagrams Dk with k vertices and L = L(Dk ) edges. Assume, for\nexample, V = a\u03c64 . Then each diagram has enumerated vertices 1, ..., k, has L = 2k edges, and moreover each\nvertex has enumerated edge-ends (legs) 1, 2, 3, 4, corresponding to all factors of the product \u03c6ij \u03c6jk \u03c6kl \u03c6li . The\nleg, for example corresponding to \u03c6ij , can be imagined as a strip (ribbon) (defining thus a ribbon or fat graph),\nthe sides of the leg-ribbon have indices i and j correspondingly. In a neighborhood of the vertex the ribbons are\nplaced on the surface as on the Figure. It is assumed that the coupling of ribbon legs is such that the coupled\nsides have the same indices.\nAs any index appears an even number of times in each vertex, then for a given side l with index i, there is\na unique closed connected path in the diagram consisting of sides with index i, and passing through l. These\npaths are called index loops. Summing over indices we will get then the factor nN where N = N (Dk ) is the\nnumber of index loops in the digram. Finally we get the following formal series\nX (\u2212a)k X\nk\n\nk!\n\nDk\n\nh2k nN (Dk ) =\n\nX\n\n(\u22124ah2 )k\n\nX\n\nnN (Ek ) =\n\nEk\n\nk\n\nX\n\n(\u22124ah2 )k nN M (k, N )\n\nk,N\n\nwhere in the second sum the summation is over all graphs with unordered set of vertices, and the set of legs\nk!4k\nof each vertex is only cyclically ordered. While changing from D to E we introduced the factor A(E)\n, where\nA(E) is the power of the automorphism group of E. We omit A(E), assuming that for \"almost all\" (as k \u2192 \u221e)\ngraphs A(E) = 1.\nIn the third sum M (k, N ) is the number of maps with k vertices and N faces. In fact, it is not difficult to\nsee that for any graph E there exists a unique (up to combinatorial equivalence) embedding f (E) of this graph\nto some oriented compact closed surface S\u03c1 for some genus \u03c1 and such that each index loop bounds an open\nsubdomain of S\u03c1 homeomorphic to a disk. This map has k vertices, 2k edges and N faces. By Euler formula\nk = N + 2\u03c1 \u2212 2 we get the following expansion, putting h = 1, a = nb\nX\nlog Z =\n(\u22124b)N +2\u03c1\u22122 n\u22122\u03c1+2 M\u03c1 (N )\nN,\u03c1\n\nwhere M\u03c1 (N ) is the number of maps with N faces and having genus \u03c1. It follows that for example for \u03c1 = 0,\nthe sum of terms corresponding to maps with N faces and having genus \u03c1 can be formally obtained as\nX\nlog Z\n=\n(\u22124b)N \u22122 M0 (N )\nlim\n2\nn\u2192\u221e n\nN\n\nIn general one can cay that application of the matrix method to counting of maps is rigorous only in case of\ntriangulations with one (see [34]) or fixed finite number of cells (see [28, 29]). It is difficult to get a nonformal\njustification of the last limit. Very clearly written introduction to applications of the matrix method to counting\nproblems is presented in [27]. Complete but less mathematical presentations one can find in many physical\npapers, see [33]. The case of fixed \u03c1 (this corresponds to counting string diagrams in perturbation theory)\nis well studied only for the dimension d = 0 of the target space, and for the following generalization with Q\nmatrices Mq , where the action is\nQ\u22121\nQ\nX\nX\nMq Mq+1 )\nV (Mq ) +\nT r(\nq=1\n\nq=1\n\n25\n\n\fand for its continuum analog as well, see review [37].\nOne should note that the case of large \u03c1 (that is growing linearly with N ), on the physical language this\ncorresponds to the space-time foam in the sense of Hawking, is open even with the absence of spin, that is for\nd = 0.\nSpin foam Spin foam is a graph \u0393 together with the local structure of a two-dimensional complex (it is\nassumed that each vertex and each edge belong at least to one two-dimensional cell) and functions a(f ) on the\nset \u0393(2) of 2-cells f and b(l) on the set \u0393(1) of edges. Moreover, a(f ) defines an irreducible representation of\nsome group (Lee or quantum) G, let Ha(f ) be the Hilbert space of this representation. If the edge l is incident\nto the faces f1 , ...fk , then put Hl = Ha(f1 ) \u2297 ... \u2297 Ha(fk ) . Let Hl0 be an invariant space in Hl . Choose once\nand for all in the invariant spaces of tensor products of any irreducible representations some orthonormal bases.\nThen b(l) is defined to be an element of the corresponding basis.\nOn a class of finite graphs A (for example, with N vertices) with such localo structure define the following\npartition function\nY\nX\nX\nY\n\u03a6(O1 (v))\ndim a(f )\nZA =\nZ(\u0393), Z(\u0393) =\n\u0393\u2208A\n\n{a(.),b(.)} f \u2208\u0393(2)\n\nv\u2208\u0393(0)\n\nwhere \u03a6 is some function of the neighborhood of radius 1 of the vertex v. If \u03a6 is positive then this defines some\nGibbs family.\nAs far as I know such partition functions were considered only as formal algebraic objects. One can note\nthat in physics partition functions are often considered which are not positive, then the sense of all calculations\nis open. In some cases quantum discrete spaces can be useful, see the next section.\nLet us give some examples, see more details in [35]. For a vertex v denote Hv = Hl1 \u2297 ... \u2297 Hlm , where\nl1 , ...lm are all 1-cells incident to v. As each 2-cell fi , incident to v, is incident to two cells emanating from v,\nthen the correponding Ha(fi ) appears twice in Hv . That is why Hv can be naturally represented as a tensor\nsquare, thus for each its element one can define its trace T r. The Ooguri-Turaev-Crane-Yetter model is defined\nby the function\n\u03a6 = T r(b(l1 ) \u2297 ... \u2297 b(lm ))\nThe corresponding partition function is finite if as a group the quantum group SU (2)q is chosen. The main\nresult is that Z(\u0393) does not depend on \u0393, if \u0393 runs through 2-dimensional skeletons of triangulations of some\nfixed 4-dimensional manifold. 3-dimensional analog is the Turaev-Viro model, and 3-dimensional analog with\nthe Lee group SU (2) is the Ponzano-Regge model (see [30]), which develops the initial Regge model and assumes\nthe discreteness of the lengths of edges: l = \u03b5j, j = 0, 21 , 1, 32 , .... With each j the representation of SU (2) having\nspin j is associated.\nSpin foam models give a possibility for the Gibbs families approach to the so called loop quantum gravity,\nthat was developed earlier in the hamiltonian framework. It was based on the so called new variables, introduced\nby Ashtekar in the classical general relativity, and used Penrose networks as a convenient basis in the space of\nfunctions on the set of connections on the fixed time slice M of the space-time represented as M \u00d7 R.\nTopological quantum field theory Axioms of topological quantum field theory as introduced in [39] resemble more axioms of S-matrix theory, than give models of the space-time structure. Gibbs families then\nreflect the well-known physical presentation of topological field theory in terms of functional integrals. The\nknown models of TFT deal with finite dimensional Hilbert spaces associated with boundary manifolds. Some\nclassification of such cases in dimension 2 can be seen in the last chapter of [46]. Here we can only relate this\nto some problems for Gibbs families.\nConsider triangulations of a two dimensional compact oriented surface of genus \u03c1 with k holes, let S be\nthe spin space. Let T (N, m1 , ..., mk ) be the set of triangulations with fixed number N of triangles and given\nnumbers m1 , ...mk of edges on each of k boundaries. For given potential one can consider the conditional\npartition function Zm1 ...mk (sboundary ) given the values sboundary of the spin on the boundary, this gives a\npositive measure \u03bc(m1 , ..., mk ) (non-normalized) on the configurations S m1 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 S mk and a measure on\nD(k) = \u222am1 ,...,mk S m1 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 S mk\nfor given k, and even on \u222ak D(k). Most questions about these measures are open. In particular, when these\nmeasures are finite and under what scalings the weak limit of the normalized measures exists ? This can give\nexamples when the mentioned Hilbert spaces have infinite dimension.\n\n26\n\n\fCausal sets Causal set (see short review [36]) V , that is a partially-ordered set with relation \u2264, satisfying\ntransitivity, reflexivity and acyclicity (if x \u2264 y and y \u2264 x then x = y). Given (finite or countable) causal set\ndefines a directed graph G (Hasse diagram of V ), where V is the set of vertices of G, and there is a directed\nedge from x to y, if x \u2264 y, x 6= y and there is no other z such that x \u2264 z \u2264 y. Vice versa, each directed graph G\nwithout cycles defines a causal set V = V (G). Thus causal sets can be reduces to graphs with a local structure.\nCausal set models are useful because for them discrete analogs of future and light cones and other conceipts,\nused in the classical general relativity, can be defined.\nNoncommutative lattices To a noncommutative C \u2217 -algebra corresponds the dual object, interpreted as a\ndiscrete noncommutative space. Strictly speaking this topics is related to the second part of this paper, and we\nshall say only some words.\nTopological space X can be approximated by discrete sets in two ways: either one takes a sequence of\ndenumerable subsets X1 \u2282 ... \u2282 Xn \u2282 ... \u2282 X, more and more dense, or use a system of embedded coverings\nU n = {Uin } (and consider the set of all closed points of its projective limit). Arbitrary covering of a compact\nspace X generates a finite partition X, moreover the set of blocks of this partition will be a T0 -space in the\nfactor topology. T0 -topology on a finite or countable set is equivalent to some partial order on it: x \u2264 y iff\ny belongs to the closure of {x}. As we have seen, with partially ordered sets a directed graph is naturally\nassociated - its Hasse diagram.\nEach finite partially ordered set V is the set of irreducible representations \u00c2 of some (nonunique in general)\nC \u2217 -algebra A, see [38]. If moreover A is separable, then the set \u00c2 is homeomorphic to the set primA of\nprimitive ideals of A, which is called a noncommutative lattice. Application of noncommutative lattices to a\nsimple quantum mechanical problem see in the last chapter of [38].\n\n5\n5.1\n\nQuantum discrete spaces\nQuantum graphs\n\nLet S be finite or countable. Denote H = l2 (A(0) ) the Hilbert space with the orthonormal basis e\u03b1 , enumerated\nby finite spin graphs \u03b1 \u2208 A(0) : (e\u03b1 , e\u03b2 ) = \u03b4 \u03b1\u03b2 , where the functione\u03b1 (\u03b2) = \u03b4 \u03b1\u03b2 . Each vector \u03c6 from H is a\ncomplex function on the set A(0) and can be written as\nX\nX\n\u03c6=\n\u03c6(\u03b1)e\u03b1 \u2208 H, k\u03c6k2 =\n|\u03c6(\u03b1)|2\n\nP\n2\n2\nThe states of the systems (wave function) are vectors \u03c6 with k\u03c6k = |\u03c6(\u03b1)| = 1.\nThe definition of quantum \"Gibbs\" states differs from classical in the fact that in quantum cases dynamics,\nor the hamiltonian, emerges automatically. Dynamics on quantum discrete space is associated with local\nsubstitutions. Roughly speaking, a subsitution consists in the change of one regular subgraph \u03b3 with another\none \u03b4, but the exact definition is somewhat laborous because one should take care about rules to connect \u03b4 with\nthe complement of \u03b3.\nVertex v \u2208 V (\u03b3) \u2282 V (G) of a regular subgraph \u03b3 of G is called internal (to \u03b3), if any of its incident edges\nconnects v with another vertex of \u03b3, and call it boundary otherwise. The set of all boundary edges call the\nboundary \u2202\u03b3 of the regular subgraph \u03b3.\nDefinition 5 The substitution rule (production) Sub = (\u0393, \u0393\u2032 , V0 , V0\u2032 , \u03c6) is defined by two \"small\" spin graphs\n\u0393 and \u0393\u2032 , two subsets V0 \u2282 V = V (\u0393), V0\u2032 \u2282 V \u2032 = V (\u0393\u2032 ) and one-to-one mapping \u03c6 : V0 \u2192 V0\u2032 , respecting the\nspins. Let an isomorphism \u03c8 : \u0393 \u2192 \u03b3 onto some regular spin subgraph \u03b3 of the spin graph \u03b1 be given, such\nthat \u03c8(V0 ) \u2283 \u2202\u03b3. The transformation (substitution) T = T (Sub, \u03c8) on the spin graph \u03b1, corresponding to the\ngiven substitution rule Sub and to the isomorphism \u03c8, is defined in the following way. Delete all edges of the\nsubgraph \u03b3 = \u03c8(\u0393), delete all vertices of V (\u03b3) \\ \u03c8(V0 ), in the non connected union of \u03b1 and \u0393\u2032 identify each\n\u03c8(v), v \u2208 V0 , with \u03c6(v) \u2208 V0\u2032 . Denote the resulting spin graph T (Sub, \u03c8)\u03b1. The function s on V (\u03b1) \\ V (\u03b3) is\ninherited from \u03b1, and on V (\u03b3) - from \u0393\u2032 .\nExamples of substitutions: deletion of an edge, appending an edge in a vertex with a new vertex, connecting\ntwo vertices with an edge, changing the spin in one vertex. The mere possibility of such substitution may\ndepend on some neighborhood of the vertex.\n(0)\nFor any N and p let HN,p \u2282 H be a finite dimensional space, generated by all e\u03b1 , \u03b1 \u2208 \u222aN\nn=0 An,p , let PN be\nthe orthogonal projector on HN,p . For a given p there are natural imbeddings HN,p \u2282 HN +1,p . Further on p is\nfixed and we omit this index, having in mind that degrees of vertices cannot exceed p. Denote HN = HN,p .\n\n27\n\n\fDefinition 6 A grammar (more exactly grammar on graphs) is defined by a finite set of substitution rules\n\u2032\nSubi = (\u0393i , \u0393\u2032i , Vi,0 , Vi,0\n, \u03c6i ), i = 1, ..., |Sub|. It is called local, if for all i the graphs \u0393i , corresponding to Subi ,\n(0)\n\nare connected. We call grammar locally bounded if for p sufficiently large the sets \u222aN AN,p are invariant with\nrespect to any of its substitutions.\n\nDefine the main operators ai (j). Index i corresponds to one of its substitution rules of the grammar. For a\ngiven i consider all possible pairs (\u03c8, \u03be), where \u03be \u2208 A(0) , and \u03c8 is a mapping of \u0393i onto a regular subgraph of\nthe spin graph \u03be. The pair (\u03c8, \u03be) is called minimal, if \u03c8(\u0393i ) does not belong to a neighborhood of 0 of radius\nless than the radius R(\u03be) = R0 (\u03be) of the graph \u03be. For given i enumerate all possible regular pairs with indices\nj = 1, 2, ...\n(\u03c8 i1 , \u03be i1 ), (\u03c8 i2 , \u03be i2 ), ..., (\u03c8 ij , \u03be ij ), ...\nIf in \u03be there are at least twp regular subgraphs, isomorphic to \u0393i and coming one to another under the action\nof a nontrivial automorphism of the graph \u03be, then they have different indices inj our numeration.\nPut\nai (j)e\u03b1 = e\u03b2 , \u03b2 = T (Subi , \u03c1\u03c8 ij )\u03b1\nfor any \u03b1 such that there exists an isomorphism \u03c1 of the spin graph \u03be ij onto OR(\u03be) (0) of the origin of \u03b1. Put\nai (j)e\u03b1 = 0 otherwise. It is clear that this definition does not depend on the choice of \u03c1. Note that kai (j)k = 1.\n\u2032\nDefine the linear operator H = H({Subi , i = 1, ..., k}, corresponding to the grammar Subi = (\u0393i , \u0393\u2032i , Vi,0 , Vi,0\n, \u03c6i ), i =\n1, ..., k, as the formal sum\nk X\nX\n\u03bbi ai (j)\nH=\ni=1\n\nj\n\nfor some complex constants \u03bbi . Then H is defined on the linear space H0 of finite linear combinations of e\u03b1 . It\nis important to note that this operator does not depend on the enumeration \u03c8 i,j due to the following equivalent\ndefinition: for all \u03b1\nk X\nX\nHe\u03b1 =\neT (Subi ,\u03c8)\u03b1\ni=1 \u03c8\n\nwhere for given i the sum over all imbeddings \u03c8 : \u0393i \u2192 \u03b1.\nAdjoint substitution rule Sub\u2217 = (\u0393\u2217 , \u0393\u2032\u2217 , V0\u2217 , V0\u2032\u2217 , \u03c6\u2217 ) to the substitution rule Sub is defined by the properties: \u0393\u2217 = \u0393\u2032 , \u0393\u2032\u2217 = \u0393, V0\u2217 = V0\u2032 , V0\u2032\u2217 = V0 , \u03c6\u2217 = \u03c6\u22121 . If substitutions i and i1 are adjoint then for any j there\nexists such j1 that (ai (j))\u2217 = ai1 (j1 ).\nThe hamiltonian is formally symmetric, H = H \u2217 , if for each i there exists j that Subj is adjoint to Subi and\n\u03bbi = \u03bb\u0304j .\nGrammars for linear graphs If p = 2 then the graph is linear, cyclic or not.

In this case any substitution rule is a pair \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b4, and substitutions are\ntransformation of words as\n\u03b1\u03b3\u03b2 \u2192 \u03b1\u03b4\u03b2\n\nfor any \u03b1, \u03b2, where the concatenation of \u03b1 = x1 ...xn and \u03b2 = y1 ...ym is defined as\n\u03b1\u03b2 = x1 ...xn y1 ...ym\n\nThe operator ai (j) allows to do the substitution i in the word \u03b1 only for a factor (subword) \u03b3 i , beginning with\nthe symbol with number j. Adjoint to the substitution rule \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b4 is the substitution rule \u03b4 \u2192 \u03b3.\nSelfadjointness Let H be symmetric on the linear space H0 of finite linear combinations of e\u03b1 . They are\nC -vectors (see [48]) for H, that is He\u03b1 \u2208 H0 . Note that H is unbounded in general.\n\u221e\n\nTheorem 12 Let the grammar be locally bounded and H be symmetric. Then H is essentially sekfadjoint on\nH0 .\nOne can get the proof from the following lemma and Nelson's criteria, see [48]. This defines the unitary\ngroup exp(itH). Note that in the lemma one does not assume symmetricity of the hamiltonian.\nLemma 10 For any grammar, a vector \u03c6 \u2208 H0 is analytic for the corresponding hamiltonian, that is\n\u221e\nX\nH k\u03c6 k\nt <\u221e\nk!\nk=0\n\nfor some t > 0.\n28\n\n\fProof. It is sufficient to take \u03c6 = e\u03b1 for some \u03b1. In this case the number of pairs (i, j) such that ai (j)e\u03b1 6= 0,\ndoes not exceed CV, V = V (\u03b1), for some constant C. In fact, the number of regular subgraphs, isomorphic to\na given \"small\" subgraph, depends on the number of vertices and on p. Write the expansion of H as\nX\nH=\nVa\na\n\nwhere Va is equal to some of \u03bbi ai (j). Then\nH n e\u03b1 =\n\nX\n\nVan ...Va1 e\u03b1 =\n\nan ,...,a1\n\nX\n\nC\u03b2 e\u03b2\n\n(23)\n\nMaximal number of vertices of graphs \u03b2 in the expansion Van ...Va1 e\u03b1 does not exceed V (\u03b1) + C1 n, as any\nfactor Vaj increases the number of vertices on not more than some constant C1 . Then for given e\u03b1 , a1 , ..., an the\nnyumber of operators Van+1 , giving nonzero contribution to Van+1 Van ...Va1 e\u03b1 is not greater than C(V (\u03b1) + C1 n)\nfor some constant C. Thus, the number of nonzero terms Van ...Va1 e\u03b1 is not greater than\nCn\n\nn\nY\n\n(|V (\u03b1)| + C1 j) = (CC1 )n\n\nj=1\n\n< (CC1 )n n!\n\nn\nY\n\nn\nY\n|V (\u03b1)|\n(\n+ j) <\nC1\nj=1\n\n|V (\u03b1)|\n|V (\u03b1)|\n) < (CC1 )n n!n2 C1\nC1 j\n\n(1 +\n\nj=1\n\nn\n\nand the norm of each term is bounded by (max \u03bbi ) . This gives convergence of the series for |t| < t0 , where t0\ndoes not depend on \u03b1. Lemma is proved.\n5.1.1\n\nC \u2217 -algebras\n\nThere are several useful C \u2217 -algebras, related to grammars on graphs: two universal B, C and one A(Gr)\ndepending on the grammar. Define these algebras.\nLet CN be the C \u2217 -algebra of all operators in the finite dimensional space HN = HN,p . The operator C \u2208 CN\n \u0304 HN,p . Then CN \u2282 CN +1 , put C = \u222aN CN . The\ncan be considered as acting in H, if we put Ce\u03b1 = 0 for e\u03b1 \u2208\nalgebra C consists of compact operators. It was used in in [49].\nLet AN = AN (Subi , i = 1, ..., k) be the C \u2217 -algebra of operators in H, generated by all ai (j) such that\nR(\u03be ij ) \u2264 N . Then the natural imbeddings \u03c6N : AN \u2192 AN +1 are defined. The inductive limit \u222aN AN = A0 of\nC \u2217 -algebras AN is called the local algebra and its norm closure A = A(Subi , i = 1, ..., k) is called the quasilocal\nalgebra. Structure of the C \u2217 -algebra A = A(Subi , i = 1, ..., k) depends on the grammar and on the fixed class\nof graph. Below we give many bexamples of hamiltonians and C \u2217 -algebras.\nUniversal C \u2217 -algebra B is generated by the operators ai (j) for all possible substitutions. B does not coincide\nwith the algebra of all bounded operators, for example, many diagonal operators in the basis e\u03b1 do not belong\nto B.\n5.1.2\n\nAutomorphisms\n(0)\n\nFurther on the local boundedness of the grammar is always assumed and we fix p such that the sets \u222aN AN,p\nare invariant with respect to all substitutions of the grammar.\nFormal hamiltonian defines a differentiation in the local algebra A0 . Consider\nHN =\n\n|Sub|\n\nX\n\nX\n\n\u03bbi ai (j)\n\ni=1 j:R(\u03be ij )\u2264N\n\nDefine the automorphism group A as follows. Take a local element A \u2208 A0 and N such that A \u2208 AN , and put\n(N )\n\n\u03b1t\n\n(A) = exp(iHN t)A exp(\u2212iHN t)\n\nTheorem 13 There exists t0 > 0 such that for any local A and any t, |t| < t0 , there exists the norm limit\n(N )\n\nlim \u03b1t\n\nN \u2192\u221e\n\n(A)\n\nThis defines the unique automorphism of the quasilocal algebra.\n29\n\n\fProof. Consider the Dyson-Schwinger series\n(N )\n\nAt\n\n=A+\n\n\u221e\nX\n(it)n\n[HN , ..., [HN , [HN , A]]...]\nn!\nn=1\n\nOne can restrict himself to local A = ai (k) for some i, k.\nLemma 11 The norm of the operator\ndently of N .\n\n(it)n\nn! [HN , ..., [HN , [HN , A]]...]\n\nis bounded from below by (Ct)n indepen-\n\nNote that the commutator belongs to A and is equal to the sum of commutators\n[ain (jn ), ..., [ai2 (j2 ), [ai1 (j1 ), A]], ...]\nmultiplied with \u03bbi1 ...\u03bbin . Each commutator is equal to the sum of 2n terms like\n\u00b1aqn (pn )...aiq2 (p2 )aq1 (p1 )\nQn\nLet us prove that after cancellations there will be not more than j=1 Cj = C n n! terms left (independently\nof N ). One should use for this the second definition of the hamiltonian. Introduce the following notation: if\nai (j)e\u03b1 = eT (Sub,\u03c8) , then we shall write ai (j)e\u03b1 = a(T (Sub, \u03c8))e\u03b1 . Then for any \u03b1, any two substitution rules\ni1 , i2 and two mappings \u03c8 1 : \u0393i1 \u2192 \u03b3 1 , \u03c8 2 : \u0393i2 \u2192 \u03b3 2 onto non-intersecting regular subgraphs \u03b3 1 , \u03b3 2 of the\ngraph \u03b1, the corresponding transformations in terms of ai (j) will give cancellating terms as\na(T (T (Sub1, \u03c8 1 )\u03b1, Sub2 , \u03c8 2 ))a(T (\u03b1, Sub1 , \u03c8 1 ))e\u03b1 \u2212 a(T (T (Sub2, \u03c8 2 )\u03b1, Sub1 , \u03c8 1 ))a(T (\u03b1, Sub2 , \u03c8 2 ))e\u03b1 = 0\netc. by induction.\n(N )\nSimilarly one can prove that for N \u2192 \u221e At converges term-by-term (for any n) to the series\n\u221e\nX\n(it)n\n[H, ..., [H, [H, A]]...]\nAt = A +\nn!\nn=1\n\nEach term of the this series is defined and the series converges, by this estimate, in norm for sufficiently small\nt. The existence of automorphism group fro all t can be proved similrly to the Robinson theorem for quantum\nspin systems, see [4].\n5.1.3\n\nKMS-states on A\n\nWe shall consider KMS states on A, which are a natural generalization of KMS states on the lattice. Sometimes\nit is useful however to consider KMS states on the algebra C (see [49]), where the situation is a bit different.\nWe restrict ourselves with the case p = 2, that is with linear graphs and assume that 2 \u2264 |S| < \u221e. The\nalgebra AN , contrary to quantum spin systems, is not finite dimensional in general (if the length of the word\ncan change by substitution). One can introduce finite dimensional algebras FN , generated by all operators\n(N )\nai (j) = PN ai (j)PN . One can assume that all these operators act in HN . Define states on FN by putting for\nany AN \u2208 FN\n\u22121\n< AN >N = ZN\nT rN [AN exp(\u2212\u03b2PN HPN )]\nZN = T rN exp(\u2212\u03b2PN HPN )\nwhere T rN is the trace in HN . Any limiting point of this sequence defines a state on A\n< A >= lim < PN APN >N\nN \u2192\u221e\n\nwhere A is local.\nTheorem 14 If \u03b2 is sufficiently small then log ZN \u223c f N for some constant f > 0.\nProof. Note first that for H = 0 this is evident as T rH 1 = dim HN = 2N +1 .\nOne can write\nX\nz(\u03b1), z(\u03b1) = (e\u03b1 , exp(\u2212\u03b2PN HPN )e\u03b1 )\nZN =\n\u03b1:R0 (\u03b1)\u2264N\n\n30\n\n\for\nZN =\n\n\u221e X\nX\n\nX\n\nk=0 Ik ,Jk \u03b1:|\u03b1|\u2264N\n\n(\u2212\u03b2)k\nz(\u03b1, (Ik , Jk ))\nk!\n\n(24)\n\nwhere for ordered arrays Ik = (i1 , ..., ik ), Jk = (j1 , ..., jk )\nz(\u03b1, (Ik , Jk )) = \u03bbi1 ...\u03bbik (e\u03b1 , PN aik (jk )PN ...PN ai1 (j1 )PN e\u03b1 ),\nthat is z(\u03b1, (Ik , Jk )) equals either \u03bbi1 ...\u03bbik or 0. Our goal is to obtain a cluster expansion for\n. X\nz(\u03b1)\nz(N ) =\n\u03b1:|\u03b1|=N\n\nof the kind\nz(N ) =\n\nX\n\ncU1 ...cUn\n\n(25)\n\nwhich is defined exactly below, to make it possible to apply the general theory of cluster expansions from [50].\nTo get the xpansion 25 we use resummation of the expansion 24. To get 25 we need an inductive construction.\nIn 25 the sum is taken over arrays of non-intersecting subsets (U1 , ..., Un ). Denote U0 = {1, ..., N } \\ \u222ani=1 Ui .\nWe define first U0 , and thendefine the \"clusters\" Ui and numbers cUi .\nWe shall do it separately for each term\n(\u2212\u03b2)k\nz(\u03b1, (Ik , Jk ))\nk!\ncorresponding to the word \u03b1 of length N and some (Ik , Jk ), after this we resumm the results.\nDefinition of U0 = U0 (\u03b1, (Ik , Jk )). We say that the substitution T = T (Sub, \u03c8) does not touch symbol\non the place v of the word \u03b1, if the image \u03c8 does not contain v. It is convenient to denote Tp the substitution\ncorresponding to the operator b(p) = aip (jp ), p = 1, ..., k. The symbol v of the word \u03b1 is untouched for given\n(Ik , Jk ), if none of the substitutions Tp , p = 1, ..., k, does not touch it. Similarly, the symbol v of the word\nb(s)...b(1)e\u03b1 is called untouched for given (Ik , Jk ) if none of Tl with s < l \u2264 k does not touch it. For given\n(\u03b1, (Ik , Jk )) the set U0 = U0 (\u03b1, (Ik , Jk )) is defined as the set of all symbols of the word \u03b1 belonging to all words\nb(s)...b(1)e\u03b1 and not touched for all s.\nDefinition of clusters Ui (\u03b1, (Ik , Jk )). Denote \u03b10 = \u03b1, \u03b1s = Ts ...T1 \u03b1, s \u2265 1. Introduce the system of\npartitions gsr , r, s = 0, ..., k. of the set of symbols of the word \u03b1s into subset. The partition g0 = g0,0 is defined\nas the partition of \u03b1 on separate symbols, that is the partition of {1, ..., N } on N blocks.\nFor a given substitution T , that trasforms the word \u03b1 to the word \u03b2, and for a given partition g = g(\u03b1) of\nthe set V (\u03b1) of symbols of the word \u03b1 define partitions g(\u03b2) of the word \u03b2. Let V1 (\u03b1, T ) be the set of symbols\nof the word \u03b1, left untouched by the substitution T . Assume that the substitution T deletes in the new word\n\u03b2 the set V (\u03b1) \\ V1 (\u03b1) of symbols, and appends some set V2 of symbols. Thus, V (\u03b2) = V1 (\u03b1) \u222a V2 . Let us\ncall the partition g(\u03b2) = g(\u03b2, g(\u03b1), T ) of the word \u03b2 the partition induced by the partition g = g(\u03b1) and by\nthe substitution T if the following conditions hold: 1) Is the block I of the partition g(\u03b1) belongs to V1 (\u03b1),\nthen this block will be again a block of the partition g(\u03b2); 2) The vertices of V2 build one block together with\nall vertices of other blocks I (not belonging to V1 (\u03b1)) of the partition g(\u03b1), having nonempty intersection with\nV (\u03b1) \\ V1 (\u03b1).\nDefine now by induction the partitions gs = gs,0 = gs (\u03b1s ) of the words \u03b1s . If gs is already defined then\ngs+1 is the partition of the word \u03b1s+1 induced by the substitution Ts+1 and by the partition gs of the word \u03b1s .\nFurther on we use induction in r. If the partition gs+1,r of the word \u03b1s+1 is defined then gs,r+1 is defined as\nthe partition of the word \u03b1s induced by the adjoint substitution Ts\u2217 .\nConsider the partition g0,k . Its blocks are some untouched separate symbols as well as others, consisting\nof more than one symbol. These others we denote by Ui = Ui (\u03b1, (Ik , Jk )) and call clusters with respect to a\ngiven pair \u03b1, (Ik , Jk ). Note that the number L = L(\u03b1, (Ik , Jk )) of clusters cannot exceed k. Moreover, the set\n{1, ..., k} is uniquely partitioned on the sets M1 = M1 (\u03b1, (Ik , Jk )), ..., ML = ML (\u03b1, (Ik , Jk )) of permutations\nrelated to the clusters 1, ..., L correspondinglyt. Let (Imi , Jmi ), Imi = Imi (Ik , Jk ), Jmi = Jmi (Ik , Jk ) be the\nsubarray (with the induced order) of the array (Ik , Jk ), corresponding to Mi .\n\n31\n\n\fDefinition of the expansion Consider some set B \u2282 {1, ..., N }. If some cluster can correspond to it\nthen it is an interval.\nLet M1 , ..., ML be subsets of the set {1, ..., k} such that \u222aL\ni=1 Mi = {1, ..., k}. Denote mi the number of\nk\n\u2032\n\u2032\nelements in Mi . To get a multiplicative expansion 25 take the sum of all (\u2212\u03b2)\nk! z(\u03b1, (Ik , Jk )), where the arrays\n\u2032\n\u2032\n(Ik , Jk ) differ from (Ik , Jk ) only in the order of terms, moreover the order inside each of the sets Mi does not\nchange. This sum is equal to\nL\nY\n(\u2212\u03b2)mi\n(\u2212\u03b2)k\nz(\u03b1, (Ik , Jk )) =\nz(\u03b1, (Imi ((Ik , Jk )), Jmi ((Ik , Jk )))) =\nm1 !...mL !\nmi !\ni=1\n\n==\n\nL\nY\n(\u2212\u03b2)mi Y\n\u03bbj\nmi !\ni=1\nj\u2208Mi\n\nTo define the expansion 25 we use resummation. For given subsets U0 , U1 , ..., Un consider all z(\u03b1, (Ik , Jk )) such\nthat Ui (z(\u03b1, (Ik , Jk ))) = Ui , i = 0, 1, ..., n, and define for a given connected U\ncU =\n\nX (\u2212\u03b2)k\nk!\n\nz(\u03b1, (Ik , Jk ))\n\nwhere the sum is over all words \u03b1 with the set V (\u03b1) = U of symbols, and over all arrays (Ik , Jk ), for which U\nis one connected cluster. We have the following \"cluster estimate\"\ncU < c1 (C\u03b2)|U|\nBy general cluster expansion theory this gives log z(N ) \u223c f N for some constant f > 0.

Take for example A = Pj,\u03b4 , that is the projector on the subspace generated by words containing thye\nword \u03b4 on place j. We have\nT rN [exp(\u2212\u03b2PN HPN )A] =\n\n\u221e\nX\n(\u2212\u03b2)k\nk=0\n\nk!\n\nT rN ((PN HPN )k A) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n(\u2212\u03b2)k X\n\nk=0\n\nk!\n\nT rN (aik (jk )...ai1 (j1 )A)\n\nIk ,Jk\n\nwhere the sum is over all Ik = (i1 , ..., ik ), Jk = (j1 , ..., jk ). The rest of the proof is quite standard and uses the\ngenral cluster expansion theory, we omit it.\nRemark 5 The case of spin graphs with p \u2265 3 should be similar to the theory developped in the section 4.3.\n\n5.2\n\nExamples and structure of the hamiltonians\n\nFrom general theory now we come to examples for linear graphs. But first we want to show connections with\nHooft quantization.\n5.2.1\n\nHooft quantization\n\nAlready Feynman [51] suggested that on the Planck scale physical laws can resemble transformations of finite automata with discrete time. In the series of papers [52, 53] Hooft discusses quantization of discrete (deterministic)\nmappings.\nIf f : S \u2192 S is a mapping of the finite set S to itself, then there exists a subset S0 , invariant with respect\nto f , moreover f : S0 \u2192 S0 is one-to-one. In l2 (S0 ) to this mappin,g corresponds some permutation matrix U ,\ndefined by\n(U \u03c6)(s) = \u03c6(f \u22121 s)\n32\n\n\fThe transformation U in the Hilbert space l2 (S) is defined as the quantization (in the sense of Hooft) of\nthe deterministic transformation f . Moreover, U is unitary equivalent to the sum of cyclic shifts on discrete\ncircles. Examples of physical systems, for which such representation is possible, are based in fact on the unitary\nequivalence of the hamiltonian to the multiplication operator, or by Fourier transform to the shift operator.\nOne should say that this is a quantization of \"first order systems\". Then there exists a matrix H such that\nUt = exp(itH), U1 = U\nIn noninteger time moments Ut does not define a deterministic transformation\nof S to itself. Moreover, H is not\n\u221a\nuniqely defined but only up the multiplication of each eigenvalue on q 1 where q is length of the corresponding\ncycle.\nThe simplest physical example is: a spinning particle in the magnetic field: in the finite dimensional space\nwith the basis eP\nm , m = \u2212l, ..., l, the diagonalization of the hamiltonian is Hem = \u03bcmem . However in another\n2\u03c0k\n\u2032\nbasis fn = \u221a1N m exp(\u2212 2\u03c0imn\nN )em , n = 0, 1, ..., N \u2212 1; N = 2l + 1, in discrete moments of time t \u2212 t = \u03bcN we\nhave the deterministic dynamics exp(i 2\u03c0k\n\u03bcN H) fn \u2192 fn+k , mod N . Hooft gives also more sophisticated examples.\nHowever, one can use quantum grammars to construct other examples of this kind.\nQuantum grammars on graphs were introduced independently by the author, but can be considered in the\nframework of more general ideas: the substitution operation is not one-valued in general (it is nondeterministic,\nusing the language of the informatics), the set S is countable, unbounded growth is possible. Though there\nare many possibilities of how to work with nondeterministic automata, the homogeneity (independence on\nthe place in the graph) makes the choice of the quantization unique up to a technical realization: sequential\ntransformation, sinchronous parallelism, asinchronous parallelism. we have chisen the latter possibility. If there\nare several possibilities, then there is a new possibilities to prescribe weights to them.\n5.2.2\n\nQuantum spin systems on a fixed graph\n\nIf the hamiltonian does not change the graph but only the configurations then we get a quantum spin system\non a fixed graph. Vice versa, any quantum spin system can be obtained as a quantum grammar on graphs, this\ncan be done by the necessary choice of the constants \u03bbi . In this case the imbeddings \u03c6N : AN \u2192 AN +1 are\ngiven by A \u2192 A \u2297 1 \u2297 ... \u2297 1. Such algebras were studied intensively, see [4].\n5.2.3\n\nLinear grammars and Toeplitz operators\n\nIn some cases one gets interesting examples of C \u2217 -algebras, which appeared earlier from different problems. For\nexample, the C \u2217 -algebra AN , generated by the substitution a \u2192 aa, is isomorphic to the C \u2217 -algebra of Toeplitz\noperators in l2 (Z+ ), generated by shifts. To study the structure of the C \u2217 -algebra is often a simpler problem\nthan to study the spectrum of the hamiltonian, but already this gives some information about the spectral\nproperties.\nConsider the case when S = {a, w} consists of two symbols, and the substitutions are aw \u2192 w, w \u2192 aw.\nPut \u03bb(aw \u2192 w) = \u03bb(w \u2192 aw) = \u03bb. Such grammar is called a right linear grammar in the informatics. The\nthe subspaces H(Lk ), where Lk is the set of words with exactly k symbols w, are invariant. For example,\nL1 = {am w = aa...aw, m = 0, 1, 2, ...}. Call H(Lk ) the k-particle space. Let Hk be the restriction of H on\nH(Lk ).\nTheorem 16 (One particle spectrum) H1 on H(L1 ) is unitary equiavalent to the operator of multiplication on\n\u03bb(z + z \u22121 ) in L2 (S 1 , d\u03bd), where d\u03bd is the Lebesgue measure on the unit circle S 1 in the complex plane C.\nH(L1 ) is isomorphic to l2 (Z+ ) via aa...aw \u2192 m. With this nisomorphism H becomes the Toeplitz operator\nin l2 (Z+ ) equal to\n\u03bbb + \u03bbb\u2217\nwhere b is the left shift in l2 (Z+ )\n(bf )(m) = f (m \u2212 1), m = 1, 2, ..., (bf )(0) = 0\nAnd the C \u2217 -algebra A becomes the C \u2217 -algebra W1 of Toeplitz operators, that is the C \u2217 -algebra of operators\nin l2 (Z+ ) generated by b. Note that the commutator [b, b\u2217 ] is a finite-dimansional operator. More generally, we\nhave the following exact sequence of algebras\n0 \u2192 K \u2192j W1 \u2192\u03c0 W \u2192 0\nwhere K is the closed two\u2013sided ideal in W1 , consisting of all compact operators in l2 (Z+ ), j is the imbedding, \u03c0\nis the natural projection W1 on W1 /K \u223c W . In fact, the commutator of any two elements from W1 is compact.\n33\n\n\fThe last assertion can be easily verified for monomials b1 b2 ...bk , where bi = b or b\u2217 . Passing to the limit this\ncan be proved for any elements. It follows that W1 /K is commutative.

It follows that W1 /K \u223c W .

See more details about this model in [60].\n5.2.5\n\nLorentzian Models and Grammars\n\nThe Lorentzian model, see [57, 58], is defined by the following construction of the graph. On the cylinder\nR \u00d7 S 1 = {(x, t)} on each line (slice) t = 0, ..., N there are lt points x1 (t), ..., xl(t) (t), in the clockwise order.\nEach pair of neighbors is connected by an edge on the line t = const. Each point xi (t) is connected by some\nnumber of edges with k(i, t) = 1, 2, ..., consecutive points of the slice t + 1, let K(i, t + 1) be the set of these\npoints. It is assumed that K(i, t + 1) \u2229 K(i + 1, t + 1) consists of exactly one point, correspondingly the right\none and the left one of these sets. The enumeration of the points is not important, the graph is considered up\nisomorphisms, respecting the slices..To each graph G corresponds the amplitude\nX\nk(i, t))\nz(G) = exp(\u03bb\ni,t\n\nP\nNote\nP that i k(i, t) equals the number of triangles between the slices t and t+ 1. At the same time i,t k(i, t) =\n2 t l(t).\nHere ki are any positive numbers, and the unitarity of this transformation is not clear. However if ki \u2264 const,\none can construct unitary transformation using quantum grammars.\nUnitary model coincides with the quantum grammar describing expansion and contraction of one-dimensional\nspace. In fact, consider at time 0 the triangulation of the disk with m edges on the boundary. The sequence\nof edges on the boundary can be identified with the word aa...a of length m. The action of the operator\ncorresponding to the substitution a \u2192 aa consists in the glueing a new triangle (having two edges outside the\ndisk) to the corresponding edge of the boundary, and the action of contraction operator corresponding to aa \u2192 a\nconsists in glueing a new triangle to two consecutive edges of the triangle and having one edge outside the disk.\nRandom analog of this quantum grammar was studied in [11]. It was shown that this model belongs to a\ndifferent universal class. It was shown that only non-markovian dynamics can give the same universal class as\nfor the dynamical triangulation models.\nGibbs families approach to the Lorentzian models was studied inn detail in [60]. Important feature of\nLorentzian models is their relations with causal sets, see reviews [59, 57].\nP\n\n5.2.6\n\nParticle on quantum space\n\nConsider the grammar with S = {a, w} and with the substitutions\na \u2192 aa, aa \u2192 a, aw \u2192 wa, wa \u2192 aw\nSubspace H1 , generated by the words ak wal , k, l = 0, 1, 2, ..., with one only symbol w, is invariant. The\nhamiltonian is a mixture of H , defined above, and the discrete laplacian H1 for free Schroedinger particle in l2\non a finite subset.\n35\n\n\f5.2.7\n\nTwo types of space quanta\n\nLet S = {a, b}, consider 4 substitutions\n1 : a \u2192 aa, 2 : aa \u2192 a, 3 : b \u2192 bb, 4 : bb \u2192 b\nWe have here two invariant one-particle subspaces Ha , Hb . For example, Ha is generated by the words a, a2 =\naa, ..., an , .... There are two invariant two particle subspaces Hab = Ha \u2297 Hb , Hba = Hb \u2297 Ha . For example,\nHab is generated by the words ak bl , k, l > 0. In general, for any n there are two inavriant 2n-particle subspaces:\nH(ab)n , generated by the words ak1 bl1 ...akn bln , H(ab)n = Ha \u2297 Hb \u2297 ... \u2297 Ha \u2297 Hb and H(ba)n , defined similarly.\nAlso for any n there exist two invariant (2n + 1)-particle subspaces Hb(ab)n = Hb \u2297 Ha \u2297 Hb \u2297 ... \u2297 Ha \u2297 Hb\nand H(ab)n a , defined similarly. The spectrum of the hamiltonian reduces using the following equivalence\nH = H0 \u2295 Ha \u2295 Hb \u2295 Hab \u2295 Hba \u2295 ... \u2295 H(ab)n \u2295 H(ba)n \u2295 Hb(ab)n \u2295 H(ab)n a ...\nto the spectra of two one-particle hamiltonians, which we have already studied. For example on Hab the\nevolution is given by the hamiltonian Ha \u2297 1 + 1 \u2297 Hb .\n5.2.8\n\nSymmetries and quantum grammars\n\nWith some quantum grammars one can associate representations of Lie algebra D of diffeomorphisms of the\ncircle. Denote Dn , D\u2212n the hamiltonians, defined by the substitutions a \u2192 an+1 and an+1 \u2192 a, n \u2265 0,\ncorrespondingly. Then in the basis \u03bd k = eak we have for example Dn \u03bd k = k\u03bd k+n , n \u2265 0. However for n < 0 we\nhave only Dn \u03bd k = (k + n + 1)\u03bd k+n . For large k and fixed m, n one can prove that\n(Dn Dm \u2212 Dn Dm )\u03bd k = (m \u2212 n + o(1))Dn+m \u03bd k\nIn this case we say that an asymptotic representation of the algebra D is given. We get more for cyclic words\n(periodic boundary conitions). The relation Dn \u03bd k = k\u03bd k+n takes place for all |n| < k, and then\n(Dn Dm \u2212 Dn Dm )\u03bd k = (m \u2212 n)Dn+m \u03bd k\nholds for all |n| , |m| \u226a k. Otherwise speaking, the latter equation holds for all m, n everywhere except some\nfinite dimensional subspace H(m, n). Note that in both cases the spectrum of D0 coincides with Z+ .\nTo get exact representation of the algebra D one should consider cyclic words of two symbols a, a\u22121 with\nrelations aa\u22121 = a\u22121 a = e, where e is the empty word, and the substitutions Dn : a \u2192 an+1 , a\u22121 \u2192 an+1 for\nall n \u2208 Z. Note that one had always in mind the representation \u2212V0,0 in the notation of [55].\nConsider linear cyclic graphs (that is the words with periodic boundary conditions) and the grammar on\nthese words with substitutions\na \u2192 aa, aa \u2192 a, aw \u2192 wa, wa \u2192 aw\nSelect among them the words with one symbol w. Note that all cyclic words of the same length with only one\nsymbol w are equivalent. They generate the Hilbert space which we denote H1 , it is isomorphic to l2 (Z+ ). Note\nthat in H1 acts an symptotic representation of Virasoto algebra.\nIf one comes from equivalence classes of cyclic words to enumerated words, that is to the basis ek \u2297 j, j \u2208 Zk ,\nthen hs the action of the group Z of shifts: on each - ek \u2297 j \u2192 ek \u2297 (j + n), n \u2208 Z, where j + n is taken mod\nk. Thus, the symmetry (earlier trivial) manifests itself in the enumeration. The action of Z can be presented\nwith fermionic variables accordingly to the Hooft quantization, discussed above, see [52, 53].\n\nReferences\n[1] R. Dobrushin.
