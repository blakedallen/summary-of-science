Introduction\nThe exact nature of the Hidden Order (HO) in URu2 Si2 has been a well documented\npuzzle for more then 20 years [1, 2, 3]. The onset of HO is seen in the specific heat as\na sharp mean field like transition at THO = 17.5K. However, a systematic search of\nany magnetic or structural transition at THO yielded negative results, thus suggesting\nthe term 'Hidden Order' to highlight the missing connection between textbook mean\nfield features, e.g. in the specific heat and the lack of any observable order parameter.\nVarious proposals made to account for this phase generally fall within two categories\nthat can be broadly summed up as (i) localized intra unit cell ordering and (ii) extended\nmomentum space ordering. The first category, in which speculations were made to the\neffect that the HO is characterized by some local ordering [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], was prompted\nby the large specific heat change and large entropy release at the HO transition, the\nlatter on the scale of \u03b4S \u2248 0.2R ln 2. Alternatively, the HO transition was viewed as\nan ordering of itinerant degrees of freedom, thus intrinsically being a momentum space\nphenomenon with the ordering occurring in momentum space [10, 11, 12, 13, 14].\nWe still do not know which of these models are closer to the true nature of the\nHO state. New hints emerging from momentum resolved spectroscopies point to the\nexistence of a momentum space instability as an important ingredient, if not a key\ningredient, in the HO puzzle. First, the new as well as old neutron scattering data\n[15, 16, 17] provide tantalizing hints that indeed the spin dynamics drastically changes\nin the HO state. New sharp resonant features appear to develop in the HO state in\nthe spin susceptibility as seen by inelastic neutron scattering, at both commensurate\nmomenta Q = (1, 0), (0, 1)\u03c0/a [18] at \u03c9 = 2 meV and at incommensurate momenta\nQ\u2217 = (0.6, 0), (0, 0.6)\u03c0/a at \u03c9r = 5 meV [18, 16, 12], indicating changes in the spin\ndynamics below THO . Second, recent Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) results\nrevealed the onset of a gap like feature in the tunneling spectra, and Quasiparticle\nInterference (QPI) data reveal the onset of a hybridization feature in the quasiparticle\nband structure of URu2 Si2 [19] that develops near or at the incommensurate vector Q\u2217 .\nThe hybridization features seen in the tunneling spectra, in quasiparticle dispersion in\nSTM and in neutron scattering resonance, all have the same energy scale of \u223c 5 meV at\ncharacteristic momentum transfers Q\u2217 . Therefore, it is at least a plausible suggestion\nthat the HO is a phenomenon that is controlled by momentum space instability. Such a\nmomentum space instability at Q\u2217 would produce a modulation of the order parameter\n\u2206HO (x) = \u2206HO exp(iQ\u2217 x).\nA question that naturally arises from these observations is: if the HO is an\nincommensurate (or a commensurate) wave phenomenon of some sort and would this\nwave produce a charge density wave (CDW) ? In this communication we prove that a\nspatially modulated HO parameter will indeed lead to a CDW in the HO state. To prove\nthis point we employ a Ginzburg-Landau (GL) analysis including a coupling between\nthe local charge density modulation \u03c1(x) and the square of the HO order parameter\n\u2206HO . We use the fact that for any order parameter its square amplitude will be a simple\n\n\fCharge density wave in hidden order state of URu2 Si2\n\n3\n\nscalar and hence in the free energy analysis it can couple to the charge density via\nFint = \u2212\n\nZ\n\ndd x\u03bb \u03c1(x) \u2206HO (x)\u2206\u2217HO (x)\n\n(1)\n\nwith coupling strength \u03bb that can be of either sign. \u03c1(x) and \u2206HO (x) are the charge\ndensity and the hidden order parameters at position x. The charge stiffness free energy\nis given by the form:\nFCDW =\n\nX\n\nfq |\u03c1q |2 .\n\n(2)\n\nq\n\nwhere fq = a1 /q 2 +a2 q 2 +a3 > 0 for all momenta[20]. The a1 term describes the Coulomb\nrepulsion, the a2 term describes the gradient energy costs for density modulations and\nthe a3 term describes a short range term. The positivity of fq insures that there is\nno CDW in the absence of the coupling. From this point on we take fq = \u03c7/2 > 0\nfor simplicity. As we show below, the amplitude of the induced CDW modulation is\nproportional to \u03bb and inversely proportional to the charge stiffness \u03c7. Minimization of\nthe total free energy F = FCDW + FHO + Fint leads to\n\u03bb\n(3)\n\u03c12q1 = \u22062HO (q1 ) ,\n\u03c7\nwhich implies that the modulation wave vector of the CDW is double that of the HO\nmodulation in real space. This observation is the main result of the paper. If the HO\nmodulation is commensurate with the lattice then the CDW will also be commensurate\n(case of Q modulation). For instance, if the HO state is a single unit cell order\nphenomenon without translational symmetry breaking, the CDW momenta are identical\nwith the main Bragg peaks of the lattice. On the other hand if the HO state is\nincommensurate, so will be the CDW (case of Q\u2217 modulation). For the HO modulated\nat an incommensurate wavevector like Q\u2217 = (0.6, 0), (0, 0.6)\u03c0/a the CDW modulation\nwill be at QCDW = (1.2, 0), (0, 1.2)\u03c0/a. Another immediate consequence of the GL\nanalysis is that the intensity of the CDW will scale as \u03c12q1 \u223c \u22062HO (q1 ) \u223c |T \u2212 THO |,\nsince the HO order parameter sets in as at a well defined mean field transition.\n2. Ginzburg-Landau Model for CDW\nRecently two of us proposed that the HO is a hybridization wave with a modulation of Q\u2217\n[14]. In our model the HO in URu2 Si2 originates from an indirect excitonic condensation\nof d\u2212band holes bound to local f \u2212band electrons. In general, such hybridization order\ntakes the form\n\u2206HO (k) =\n\nX\n\nVq+k,q h c\u2020q fq+k i\n\n(4)\n\nq\n\nIn particular, we argue that the coupling is mainly between electrons (and holes) with\nmomenta Q\u2217 /2 (and \u2212Q\u2217 /2) and vice-versa, where Q\u2217 /2 = (0.3, 0)\u03c0/a . This coupling\ninduces a modulation wave vector of Q\u2217 in the hidden order state. In total there are\nfour incommensurate wave vectors Qi , Q1 = Q\u2217 and the three equivalent vectors in\ntetragonal symmetry, rotated in the (a,b)-plane by multiples of \u03c0/2 . We will assume\n\n\f4\n\nCharge density wave in hidden order state of URu2 Si2\n\n \u0308HO (Q*)\n\u02212Q*\n\nT HO\n\nT\n\nFigure 1.

The CDW order is\ninduced by onset of HO and opens up with higher power of T \u2212 THO |\n\nin the following that the HO phase forms a monodomain characterized by a single wave\nvector direction such that Qi = \u00b1Q\u2217 . The corresponding Ginzburg-Landau (GL)\nenergy functional for the HO is [20]\nFHO =\n\nX\n\nck |\u2206HO (k)|2\n\nk\n\n1\n1\n+ \u03b1 |\u2206HO (k)|2 + \u03b2 |\u2206HO (k)|4\n(5)\n2\n4\nP\nwhere the first term is the kinetic energy and ck = c Qi (k \u2212 Qi )2 is the stiffness of the\nhidden order field, the coefficient of the second order term changes sign at T = THO ,\n\u03b1 = a(T \u2212 THO ), and \u03b2 is a positive constant. It is clear that without the coupling with\nother degrees of freedom, FHO favors of a modulation with momentum \u00b1Q\u2217 , noting that\nTHO is largest for these momentum values.

The amplitude of the resulting CDW is linear in Tc \u2212 T , which is a direct\nexperimental prediction.\nIn Fig. 2 ,3 and 4 we plot the numerical solution for Eq. (9-10) for the parameters\n\u03b1 = \u22120.005, \u03b2 = 0.001, \u03c7 = 1.0, \u03bb = \u22120.05 and c = 50, 10, 2 respectively (which\neffectively correspond to the weak, intermediate and strong coupling regimes). The\nnumerical calculations are consistent with the results obtained above. In the weak\ncoupling regime, we obtain a CDW oscillating with wave vectors around 2Q\u2217 in all\nthree cases. For large stiffness ( Fig. 2 ), \u2206HO oscillates with a single wave vector Q\u2217\nand is not affected significantly by the coupling with the CDW. The CDW oscillates\nwith a rapid oscillation 2Q\u2217 on top of a slow modulation. When the stiffness decreases\n( Fig. 3,4 ), the peaks in \u2206HO (q) and \u03c1q broaden up. Interferences between momenta\nwithin the peak width cause the modulation to vanish at large r.\n\n\f6\n\nCharge density wave in hidden order state of URu2 Si2\n\n'HO(q)\n\n3\n10 Uq 'HO(r)\n\n8\n\n4\n\n10 U(r)\n\n0.02\n\n2.0\n\n1.0\n0.00\n4\n\n1.0\n\n-0.02\n0.0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n*\n\nq/Q\n\n3\n\n0\n\n0.0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n*\n\nrQ\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n*\n\nrQ\n\nFigure 2.

Conclusions\nIn this paper we showed that in the presence of a HO parameter with modulation\nwavevector Q\u2217 , a charge density wave with modulation wavevector 2Q\u2217 emerges,\nprovided an attractive coupling between the HO parameter amplitude (squared) and\nthe charge density modulation exists in the free energy. We predict that the amplitude\nof the resulting CDW grows linearly in temperature below THO . We hope that our\nresults will stimulate a detailed search for the proposed CDW. The natural techniques\nthat would allow for CDW observatoin would be neutron scattering, x ray scattering and\nlocal probes. In princilple the optical conductivity and ARPES might also see effects of\nband changes due to CDW formation. If CDW is observed it may shed further light on\nthe nature of the hidden order state in URu2 Si2 .\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors enjoyed fruitful discussions with J. C. Davis, M. J. Graf, B.
