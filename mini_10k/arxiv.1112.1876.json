The principles of\nthe theory of quantum-thermal fluctuations of effective macroparameters and their correlations have been formulated. The theory satisfies the applicability conditions of equilibrium thermodynamics and is based on effective macroparameters, which take\nthe integral stochastic action of the environment into account\nat any temperatures. The correlator of conjugate macroparameters, namely, the effective entropy and the effective temperature, has been calculated. The correlator was found to be proportional to the effective action which characterizes the stochastic environment. The pair correlators for the conjugate effective\nparameters \"entropy\u2013temperature\" and \"coordinate\u2013momentum\"\nhave been demonstrated to depend linearly on the effective action,\nwith their minimum values being determined by Planck's constant.\n\nThis relation is equivalent to understanding the temperature, which is measured on the Kelvin scale, as a\nconditional \"marker\" for the thermal equilibrium.\nIn statistical thermodynamics [1\u20135], including the\nmacroparameter fluctuation theory, every macroparameter A of the object, including the temperature, is regarded as a random variable characterized by fluctuations \u03b4A around its average value hAi. To preserve the\nterminology used in the traditional thermodynamic description, the additional requirement is put forward simultaneously, namely, the relative dispersion of an arbitrary macroparameter A is confined by the condition1\nD(A)\n6 1.\nhAi2\n\n(2)\n\nHere,\n1. Problem of Accounting for Quantum Effects\nin the Macroparameter Fluctuation Theory\nIn the last years, the necessity in the application of thermodynamics to relatively small objects (nanoparticles,\nnuclear spins, and so forth), which are in the thermal\nequilibrium at low temperatures, has been recognized.\nThus, a necessity to attentively analyze the fundamentals of thermodynamics arose.\nThe equilibrium thermodynamics is known to be based\nupon four principles (laws). Among them, the zeroth\nlaw, which introduces the fundamental idea of thermal\nequilibrium between an object and its macroenvironment (called a thermostat), is primordial. In the classical thermodynamics, all macroparameters are determined rigorously, so that the zeroth law looks like a condition for the \"strict equality\" between the temperatures\nof the object, T , and the thermostat, T0 ,\nT = T0 .\n\n1120\n\n(1)\n\nD(A) \u2261 h(\u03b4A)2 i = hA2 i \u2212 hAi2\nis the dispersion of macroparameter A calculated by averaging over a distribution typical of the macroparameter fluctuation theory [1\u20133]. Below,\npfor convenience, we\nuse the standard deviation \u2206A = D(A).\nIn this case, the concept of thermal equilibrium obtains a generalized meaning. It is understood that the\nobject temperature can also fluctuate (a \"soft\" equilibrium condition) owing to the thermal stochastic action\nby the thermostat, which is characterized by the Boltzmann constant kB . This means that a requirement similar to inequality (2) is imposed on the magnitude of \u2206T\nas well. At the same time, the temperature of the thermostat, as a system with the infinite number of degrees\nof freedom, does not fluctuate, i.e. \u2206T0 = 0.\n1\n\nIn the cases where the denominator in Eq. (2) is nullified, Bogoliubov's quasiaverage [6] rather than Gibbs's average has to\nbe used.\n\nISSN 2071-0186. Ukr. J. Phys. 2011. Vol. 56, No. 10\n\n\fQUANTUM-THERMAL FLUCTUATIONS OF EFFECTIVE MACROPARAMETERS\n\nAs a result, the zeroth law in the statistical thermodynamics is expressed as a collection of two conditions,\n(\u2206T )2\n6 1,\nT02\n\nT = T0 \u00b1 \u2206T ;\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u2206T is the standard deviation from hT i, and\n(\u2206T )2 , according to the notations in formula (2), is the\ntemperature dispersion. Hence, only the average temperature of the object, hT i, coincides now with the temperature of thermostat, T0 .\nAs is known, in the standard fluctuation theory [2, 3],\nexpressions for dispersions of arbitrary macroparameters can be obtained on the basis of the distribution\nwith the modulus \u0398. Involving phenomenological results, the quantity \u0398 is usually written down in the form\n\u0398 = kB T0 . We attract attention to the fact that this expression implies that a model consisting of a collection of\nclassical oscillators is implicitly used for the thermostat.\nBelow, we refer to it as the classical model.\nIn particular, A. Einstein also found formulas [1] for\nthe temperature dispersion,\n(\u2206T )2 =\n\nkB 2\n1\n\u03982 =\nT ,\nkB CV\nCV 0\n\n(4)\n\nand the dispersions of the object's internal energy U at\na constant volume V ,\n(\u2206U )2 =\n\nCV 2\n\u0398 = kB CV T02 ,\nkB\n\u2202U\n\u2202T\n\n(5)\n\nV\n\nis the heat capacity of the object.\nIt is of interest to elucidate which are the objects,\nfor which the expression obtained above satisfies the inequality in condition (2). The answer is contained in a\nspecific expression for the heat capacity. For instance,\nfor the macroscopic objects consisting of atoms, U \u223c N\nand (CV ) \u223c N , where N has an order of the Avogadro\nnumber. Hence, the dispersion (\u2206T )2 \u223c N1 . Accordingly, (\u2206U )2 \u223c N . Therefore, condition (2) is satisfied\nfor the relative dispersions of internal energy and temperature in such objects at high temperatures, if N \u226b 1.\nAt the same time, we attract attention to the fact that,\nfor example, in the case of a single classical oscillator\n(N = 1), for which U = kB T and CV = kB , and which\nis in equilibrium with the thermostat, we have\n(\u2206U )2\n= 1;\nhU i2\n\n(\u2206T )2\n= 1.\nhT i2\n\nISSN 2071-0186.

At the same time, the\nmodel of thermostat does not undergo changes and remains classical. On this route, the satisfactory results\ncan still be obtained for systems of particles with N \u226b 1\n(except for, maybe, the region of ultralow temperatures).\nHowever, there emerge the problems for the equilibrium\nthermal radiation (where the concept of the number of\nparticles is absent) and a single quantum-mechanical oscillator.\nLet us demonstrate the aforesaid using the quantummechanical oscillator as an example. Its internal energy\nis equal, according to A. Einstein [7], to\nUqu =\n\nwhere\nCV (T, V ) =\n\nThus, the condition of macroscopicity (N \u226b 1) is not\nstrictly mandatory, while carrying out calculations in the\nframework of classical statistical mechanics and in the\nhigh temperature range.\nA different situation arises at relatively low temperatures, when quantum-mechanical effects manifest themselves.

Note that this circumstance did not draw\na special attention of researchers. A.I. Anselm [8] was\nprobably the only who marked it. In this connection,\nhe pointed out that \"the conventional thermodynamics\nis not applicable as the temperature falls down\". This\nmeans that the statistical thermodynamics considered\nas a macrotheory cannot be based exclusively upon the\nquantum statistical mechanics as a microtheory.\nIn our opinion, all that originates from the fundamental credo of quantum statistical mechanics, according\nto which the quantum-mechanical and thermal actions\nof the environment can be taken into consideration independently. In this connection, the standard routine\nconsists in that the quantum-mechanical characteristics\nof a system of microobjects are determined firstly (at\nT0 = 0), and only then the system is embedded into a\nclassical thermostat with the distribution modulus kB T0 .\nAt the same time, formula (6) for a quantum-mechanical\noscillator and an analogous formula for the internal energy of the thermal irradiation, which are confirmed by\nexperiment, testify that those two types of stochastic\naction manifest themselves, as a rule, jointly and nonadditively.\nIn order to overcome the arisen problems, we developed a theory [8\u201311], which is based on a combined account of the quantum-mechanical and thermal\nstochastic actions by the environment. The theory denies the classical model of thermostat in favor of the\nquantum-mechanical one, including the case of heat capacity calculations. Moreover, in this case, the introduction of a different \"marker\" for the thermal equilibrium state is required. The matter is that the Kelvin\ntemperature used for such purposes in the quantum statistical mechanics turns out noninformative in the region, where the quantum-mechanical and thermal effects\njointly manifest themselves, because this characteristic\n\n1122\n\nreflects only the thermal stochastic action (in terms of\nthe Boltzmann constant). In addition, it is adopted to\nbe equal to zero in quantum mechanics, where, nevertheless, the stochastic action (although being already of the\nquantum-mechanical type in terms of Planck's constant)\ntakes place by essence.\nPurely intuitive considerations stimulate us to adopt\nthe expression that follows from the Planck formula for\nthe energy of quantum-mechanical oscillator UPl , as a\nnew \"marker\"; namely,\nT\u2261\n\n~\u03c9\n~\u03c9\n\u03ba\u03c9\nUPl\n=\ncoth\n= \u03ba\u03c9 coth\n,\nkB\n2kB\n2kB T\nT\n\n(11)\n\nwhere the notation \u03ba = ~/2kB introduced earlier is used.\nWe define this quantity as the effective temperature. It\nis important that, at the Kelvin temperature T = 0, the\neffective temperature has a nonzero minimum,\nT min = \u03ba\u03c9 6= 0.\n\n(12)\n\nIn the general case, according to formulas (11) and\n(12), the effective temperature is a two-parameter function T = f (T, \u03c9). It can be reduced to a one-parameter\nfunction only in the limiting cases T = 0 and T \u226b T min ,\ni.e., where T \u2248 T min and T \u2248 T , respectively. Its simultaneous dependence on the Planck and Boltzmann\nconstants allows one to assert that, in view of the relation \u03ba = 2k~B , the stochastic action of the \"thermal\"\ntype cannot be ignored even at the Kelvin temperature\nT0 = 0.\nOn this basis, we constructed a theory of fluctuations\nfor macroparameters and their correlations, which is presented below. In so doing and keeping preserved all\ntraditional relations between thermodynamic quantities\ncoupled with the temperature, we introduced the corresponding effective macroparameters, which are the same\nfunctions of the effective temperature.\n2. Effective Temperature and Effective Internal\nEnergy Fluctuations\nTo calculate the dispersions of macroparameters taking\nthe stochastic action of the quantum-mechanical type\ninto account at any temperatures, let us use the results\nof work [9], which is a macrodescription in the framework\nof a theory called by us the modern stochastic thermodynamics [11]. It is based on the Gibbs distribution in\nthe space of macroparameters [5, 12].\nTo describe the stochastic environment, we introduce\na quantum-mechanical model (a quantum thermostat)\nthat combines the concepts of vacuum and thermostat.\nISSN 2071-0186. Ukr. J. Phys. 2011. Vol. 56, No. 10\n\n\fQUANTUM-THERMAL FLUCTUATIONS OF EFFECTIVE MACROPARAMETERS\n\nIt comprises an infinite set of quantum-mechanical normal modes of all frequencies at any fixed Kelvin temperature, being an analog of equilibrium thermal radiation.\nThe effective temperature of the object (11) is supposed\nto fluctuate as well with a characteristic frequency \u03c9, so\nthat the zeroth law reads\n(13)\n\nT = T0 \u00b1 \u2206T\n\nin the developed theory, where T0 is the effective temperature of the thermostat, and \u2206T is the standard deviation of the effective temperature of the object under\nthe equilibrium conditions.\nFrom the modern viewpoint, the primordial principle\nof the fluctuation theory of macroparameters is the principle of entropy maximum in the thermal equilibrium\nstate. The exponential Gibbs form for the distribution\nin the space of macroparameters follows from it [12],\ndW (E) = \u03c1(E)dE =\n\nE\n1\nexp{\u2212 }dE.\n\u0398\n\u0398\n\n(14)\n\nHere, E is a random value of the internal energy of a\nmacroobject, which depends on the macroparameters\nthat characterize the type of its interaction with the environment.\nOne should bear in mind that, in the initial version\nof the macroparameter fluctuation theory, the distribution modulus corresponded to the classical model of thermostat with the Kelvin temperature T0 . Since the developed theory uses the quantum-mechanical model of\nthermostat, the corresponding distribution modulus is\nexpressed in terms of the effective thermostat temperature T0 like kB T0 . As a result, the standard formula for\nthe macroparameter fluctuation distribution [1\u20133] and\nthe expressions for the dispersions of any macroparameters, which follow from it, remain formally invariable,\nbut they are expressed now in terms of effective macroparameters. Therefore, the dispersion of the effective temperature of a macroobject, instead of formula (4), looks\nlike\n(\u2206T)2 =\n\nCV \u2261\n\nkB 2\nT ,\nCV 0\n\n\u2202U\n\u2202T\n\n(15)\n\n(16)\n\nis the effective heat capacity of the object. Accordingly,\nfor the dispersion of the effective internal energy, instead\nof formula (5), we obtain\n(\u2206U)2 = kB CV T20 .\nISSN 2071-0186. Ukr. J. Phys. 2011. Vol. 56, No. 10\n\n(17)\n\nIn other words, all expressions (13)\u2013(17) preserve their\nearlier forms in the new theory. In this way, the concept\nof the equilibrium state between an object and a stochastic environment remains also invariable. However, this\nequilibrium is now a generalized concept, which involves\nthe existence of two nonadditive types of stochastic action in the integral concept of effective temperature T.\nNow, let us apply the results obtained to the study\nof a macroobject that can be represented as a quantummechanical oscillator2. For this object, U \u2261 UPl , and the\neffective heat capacity CV = kB . Then formula (15) for\nthe effective temperature dispersion looks like\n(\u2206T)2 = (T0 )2 ,\nand the relative dispersion of the effective temperature\nof this object obeys condition (3) now. It is the difference of this quantity from the dispersion of the Kelvin\ntemperature of the same object in the quantum statistical mechanics. Accordingly, the relative dispersion of its\ninternal energy, with regard for the general formula (17)\nand the formulas CV = kB and U = kB T0 , reads\nkB CV (T0 )2\n(\u2206U)2\n=\n= 1,\nU2\n(kB T0 )2\n\n(18)\n\nand condition (2) is also satisfied.\nTo make a more detailed comparison between the formulas obtained here and those known from the quantum\nstatistical mechanics, let us express the dispersion of the\neffective internal energy of a quantum-mechanical oscillator in the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0012 \u00132 \u0014\n\u03c9\n~\u03c9\n\u22122\n2\n\u03ba\n1 + sinh\n.\n(19)\n(\u2206U) =\n2\nT0\nBy comparing formulas (19) and (8), where the heat capacity looks like expression (7), we can present the second term in Eq.

Hence, in the theory developed\nhere, the validity of condition (2) for the effective internal energy both at an arbitrary Kelvin temperature and\nat T0 \u2192 0 is essentially associated with the account for\nthe energy of zero oscillations.\nIn our opinion, another important result was also obtained in this consideration. It consists in that the zero\nenergy has not also an exact invariable value, but possesses a certain \"dispersion\" or \"width\", by fluctuating\nwithin its limits. Naturally, there arises a question: \"At\nthe expense of what does it take place?\" The answer is\nthat, in this case, the system is in the equilibrium contact\nwith \"cold\" (in the Kelvin sense) vacuum, which renders\na quantum-mechanical stochastic action. The latter results in the randomization of the internal energy of an\nobject even at the absolute zero temperature.\n3. Fluctuations of Effective Entropy and Their\nCorrelation with Fluctuations of Effective\nTemperature\nUnder the thermal equilibrium conditions, besides the\nfluctuations of individual macroparameters, \u03b4A and \u03b4B,\na considerable role is also played by the correlation between them. The measure of this correlation is known\nto be given by the expression \u03c3AB \u2261 h\u03b4A, \u03b4Bi referred\nto in the general case as the correlator.\nLet us analyze the correlation between the fluctuations\nof effective macroparameters. In so doing, we are interested in a nontrivial case of conjugate effective macroparameters. It is known that the concept of conjugate\n\n1124\n\nquantities is one of the key ones in quantum mechanics.\nNevertheless, it is also used in thermodynamics, but, as\na rule, on the basis of heuristic considerations. While\nanalyzing the thermodynamic potentials (see, e.g., work\n[13] by Sommerfeld), it hits you in the eye that they contain some stable combinations of macroparameters, such\nas (Ada) or (adA). For instance, the temperature is always combined with the entropy, and the pressure with\nthe volume. Physically, those relations reveal themselves\nin every pair in the existence of a nonzero correlator between macroparameter fluctuations, which reflects their\nmutual interdependence. This circumstance forms the\ninitial base to consider the pair of effective quantities\nS and T as thermodynamically conjugate, like the pair\ncoordinate\u2013momentum in quantum mechanics.\nTo substantiate this statement within the developed\ntheory, let us calculate the dispersion of the effective entropy and the correlator between the fluctuations of the\neffective entropy and the effective temperature. Taking\ninto account that, at a fixed effective volume V, the fluctuation of the effective entropy is\n\u03b4S =\n\n\u03b4U\nT0\n\n=\nV\n\n1\nCV * \u03b4T,\nT0\n\n(25)\n\nwe obtain the following expression for the corresponding\ndispersion:\n(\u2206S)2 \u2261 h(\u03b4S)2 i =\n\nC2V\nC2\nh(\u03b4T)2 i = V2 (\u2206T)2 .\n2\nT0\nT0\n\n(26)\n\nTaking into consideration the consequence of general formula (15) for the standard deviation of the effective tem1/ 2\nperature, (\u2206T) = (kB )0 T(CV )\u22121/ 2 , and extracting the\nsquare root of expression (26), we obtain that the standard deviation of the effective entropy reads\n\u2206S =\n\n\u00011/2\nC2V\n.\n(\u2206T) = kB C2V\nT0\n\n(27)\n\nTo derive the required fluctuation correlator \u03c3ST , let\nus use formula (25) once more. We obtain that this\ncorrelator is proportional to the temperature dispersion:\n\u03c3ST = h\u03b4S * \u03b4Ti =\n\nCV\nCV\nh\u03b4T * \u03b4Ti =\n(\u2206T)2 .\nT0\nT0\n\n(28)\n\nTaking Eq. (15) into account, the corresponding fluctuation correlator is\nCV kB\n\u03c3ST =\n(T0 )2 = kB T0 ,\n(29)\nT0 CV\nso that the dependence on the effective heat capacity\ndisappears. In other words, the correlator of the effective macroparameters \u03c3ST is governed only by a parameter of the quantum thermostat, namely, by its effective\nISSN 2071-0186. Ukr. J. Phys. 2011.

Therefore, it behaves like a\nquantum-mechanical correlator between the variables p\nand q in quantum mechanics, which also does not equal\nzero. This circumstance comprises an additional argument to consider the effective macroparameters S and T\nas conjugate quantities.\n4. Interrelation between the Correlation of\nConjugate Micro- and Macroparameter\nFluctuations and the Effective Action\nby the Environment\nTo elucidate the physical sense of the expression for \u03c3ST\nin the form (29), we address to the (~, k)-dynamics [8,\n10]. In so doing, we proceed from Bogoliubov's idea\n[14], according to which only the stochastic action of the\nenvironment can invoke a nontrivial correlation between\nfluctuations of the micro- and macroparameters.

Using interrelation (42), we demonstrate that the\ncorrelator \u03c3ST of the form (29) also depends on J0 .

Schr\u00f6dinger uncertainty relations and their\nrole in the theory of fluctuations of microand macroparameters\nIt is known that the physical content of the uncertainties relation (UR), introduced for the first time by W.\nHeisenberg in quantum mechanics, has been associated\nfor many years exclusively with the theory of measurements. However, it was found that URs take place in\nother theories as well: in the equilibrium thermodynamics, theory of Brownian motion, and so forth. In our\nopinion, this circumstance is related to the stochastic action of an environment, which implicitly generates URs\nin those theories. From this viewpoint, a search for a\nuniversal relation between URs arising at zero and finite\ntemperatures is quite justified. The analysis of fluctuations of conjugate micro- and macroparameters, which\nwas carried out above, allows URs to be interpreted in\nthe framework of the fluctuation theory developed here.\nFrom the mathematical viewpoint, the most general\nUR proposed by E. Schr\u00f6dinger (SUR) is an implementation of the Cauchy\u2013Buniakowski\u2013Schwarz inequality in\nthe space of corresponding quantities [15],\nUP AB \u2261 \u2206A\u2206B > \u03c3AB .\n\n(45)\n\nISSN 2071-0186.

The standard deviations \u2206A\nand \u2206B play the role of a measure for the \"uncertainties\" of random variables, the macroparameters A and\nB. Accordingly, \u03c3AB is the correlator of fluctuations of\nthose quantities.\nFor conjugate micro- and macroparameters, the\nnonzero correlator of fluctuations imposes a restriction\non the mutual behavior of standard deviations of those\nquantities. To show the fundamental character of similar\nrestrictions, the left- and right-hand sides in relation (45)\nshould be calculated independently, both in the microand macro-theories.\nTo calculate the quantity UPST , which is typical of\nthe macrotheory, we use formulas (27) and (15). As a\nresult, we obtain that this quantity does not depend on\nthe effective heat capacity and looks like\nUPST \u2261 (\u2206S)(\u2206T) = kB T0 .\n\n(46)\n\nComparing formulas (46) and (29), we notice that,\nin the state of equilibrium between the object, which is\nsimulated as a quantum-mechanical oscillator, and the\nquantum thermostat, two different physical quantities,\nUPST and \u03c3ST , have identical values.

The saturated form of\nthis SUR is associated with the fact that the averaging\nof the corresponding operators of stochastic action was\ncarried out with the use of the wave function depending on the temperature. The fact that both SURs (49)\nand (52) are governed by the same macroparameter, J0 ,\nis a substantial confirmation of the overlapping of those\ntheories, which are traditionally referred exclusively to\neither micro- or macrodescriptions of the Nature.\nIt is worth demonstrating an interesting consequence\nof such an overlapping.

BARYAKHTAR\n\npartitioned into elementary cells of 2\u03c0\u03c9~\u2217 , the dimensions of which, however, increases with the temperature.\nIn this connection, there emerges a tempting idea to\ntreat the theory of fluctuations of macroparameters in\nthe framework of equilibrium stochastic thermodynamics as a quasiclassical theory in the phase space of the\nvariables (S, T). In its turn, the quasiclassical approximation in the quantum-mechanical theory can be treated\nas a theory of fluctuations of microparameters in the\nphase space of the variables (p, q). Such an interpretation allows the mathematical apparatus of the corresponding theories to be combined in the framework\nof a synthetic theory, which would substantially cover\nboth the traditional thermodynamics and the traditional\nquantum-mechanical theory.\n6. Conclusions\nTo summarize, we have proposed an approach, which allows the main paradox of the standard theory of fluctuations of macroparameters to be overcome. The paradox is associated with the fact that the conventional\nmethod of taking the quantum-mechanical effects into\naccount leads to that the results obtained go beyond\nthe scope of the thermodynamic description. As a result, on the basis of the quantum-mechanical model of\nthermostat and the microdescription within the (~, k)dynamics, a theory of quantum-thermal fluctuations of\neffective macroparameters and their correlation has been\ndeveloped, with the corresponding thermodynamic description being preserved.\nIt has been demonstrated that the effective action,\nwhich is regarded as a macroparameter that reflects the\nstochastic influence of the environment, is responsible\nfor the formation of corresponding dispersions and correlators. We also found that the uncertainties product\nof conjugate macroparameters, the effective entropy and\nthe effective temperature, which characterizes the area\nof an elementary cell in the phase space, is confined from\nbelow by the energy of zero oscillations when approaching the absolute zero temperature.\nIn addition, we have showed that the correlators of the\npairs of conjugate effective macroparameters (S, T) and\n(P, Q) in the equilibrium state are proportional to each\nother at any Kelvin temperature and linearly depend on\nthe same macroparameter, the effective action J0 of the\nquantum thermostat.\nAt last, we have demonstrated that the minimum values of UP PQ and UP ST are determined by the same world\nconstant; it is Planck's constant. It allows the theory of\nfluctuations of effective macroparameters to be regarded\n\n1128\n\nas a quasiclassical theory in the phase space of the variables (S, T), and the quasiclassical theory in the phase\nspace of the variables (p, q) as a theory of microparameters fluctuations.\nWe consider as a pleasant duty to express our gratitude to A.G.
