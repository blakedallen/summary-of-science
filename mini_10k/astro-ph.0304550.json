The\nunification of AGNs (Antonucci 1993), UV spectral shapes\n(Maiolino et al. 2001) and the modeling of AGNs infrared\nspectral energy distributions (Pier & Krolik 1993) all suggest the presence of numerous type-2 quasars in the Universe. These obscured AGN are thought to outnumber unobscured objects by a factor of \u2248 3:2 at redshifts out to z \u2248 3.5\n(Willott et al. 2000; Fiore et al. 2001) and it is important\nto understand whether this ratio applies at higher redshifts\nand luminosities (Barcons et al. 1998; Almaini, Lawerence\n& Boyle 1999; Stern et al. 2002). Obscured AGN are also\nbelieved to be responsible for a significant fraction of the\nhard X-ray background (Comastri et al. 1995). Almost all\nof the soft X-ray background (< 2 keV) has been resolved\ninto discrete sources, the majority of which are broad line\n(BL) type-1 QSO's. At higher energies, typical unobscured\nQSO spectra are too steep to explain the XRB and account\nfor only \u2248 20 % of the sources (Hasinger et al. 1998). Obscured AGNs provide a natural explanation, since photoelectric absorption allows only the hard X-rays to penetrate.\nThis implies the majority of the energy density generated\nby accretion in the Universe takes place in obscured AGN.\nThese results have been confirmed by data from two deep\nChandra observations (Brandt et al. 2001; Rosati et al. 2002)\nand recent analysis from an XMM-Newton observation of the\nLockman Hole has also revealed similar results; Mainieri et\nal. (2002) found \u2248 27 % of the Lockman Hole sample are\nc 0000 RAS\n\nExtremely Red Objects, the majority of which contain an\nobscured AGN.\nRecently a small number of type-2 quasars candidates\nhave been identified, but these results are usually based\non limited data (Fabian et al. 2000; Willott et al. 2001;\nFabian et al. 2001). The best published type-2 quasars,\nall obtained using the Chandra X-ray Observatory, are\nIRAS 09104+4109 at z = 0.44 (Iwasawa et al. 2001), originally observed with BeppoSAX (Franceschini et al. 2000),\nCDF-S 202 at z = 3.7 (Norman et al. 2001), A18 at z = 1.467\n(Crawford et al. 2001), CX052, z = 3.288 (Stern et al. 2002)\nand B2 0902+343, z = 3.395 (Fabian, Crawford & Iwasawa\n2002). Correcting for absorption, these objects have X-ray\nluminosities of the order 1045 erg s\u22121 and intrinsic absorption NH \u2248 1024 cm\u22122 .\nTo identify likely type-2 quasars which are bright\nenough to provide reasonable X-ray spectra, we have observed two Narrow line radio galaxies (NLRGs) with XMMNewton. The correlation between the mass of the central\nSMBHs and the galaxy spheroidal component (Magorrian et\nal. 1998) indicates that SMBHs are most likely to reside in\nmassive spheroids. Radio galaxies almost always host (forming) massive spheroids (van Bruegel et al. 1998), and NLRGs lack broad components to their optical emission lines,\nso these galaxies are promising candidates for hosting obscured SMBHs (Barthel 1989). To identify such objects several parameters need to be measured; in particular the absorbing column of the obscuring material and the intrinsic X-ray luminosity. In the context of this paper Type-2\nquasars are defined to have an intrinsic, hard X-ray (2 \u2013\n\n\f2\n\nP.M.

The X-ray\nabsorbing (gas and dust) column density of Seyfert 2s has\nNH \u2248 1022 - 1025 cm\u22122 (Risaliti, Maiolino & Salvati 1999),\nand type-2 quasars are expected to have similar values.\nWe present XMM-Newton observations and spectral fitting of two powerful FRII radio galaxies, B3 0731+438 and\n3C 257. Both sources are high redshift NLRGs with predicted X- ray luminosities well within the range of that expected for type-2 quasars. 3C 257 is the highest redshift\n(z = 2.474) radio galaxy observed in the 3C catalog with\na fairly smooth K band emission and morphology resembling an elliptical galaxy (van Breugel 1998). B3 0731+438\n(z = 2.429) is a typical FRII radio galaxy with double-lobed,\nradio emitting hot spots and a central core (Carilli et al.\n1997; Motohara et al. 2000).\nThis paper is organized as follows; in Section 2 we discuss sample selection and the use of optical emission line\nluminosities to determine the predicted X-ray luminosity of\nboth sources. This is followed in Sections 3 and 4 by the\nXMM-Newton observations and data analysis. In Section 5\nwe discuss the spectral fitting and in the final section we\nconclude our findings.\n\n2\n\nnent (FWHMH\u03b1+[NII] 800 km s\u22121 ) and 3C 257 has a somewhat broader line (FWHMH\u03b1+[NII] 1800 km s\u22121 ). Thus, for\nboth objects their spectra indicate prominent emission from\na narrow-line region while any nuclear emission is highly\nobscured.\nFor B3 0731+438 the diagnostic emission-line ratios are\nconsistent with the presence of a Seyfert-2 nucleus (Evans\n1998). A narrow-band optical image shows a large Ly\u03b1 emission nebula (McCarthy 1991), suggestive of a hidden nucleus\nionising the extended gas. This possibility is supported by\na narrow-band 2.25 \u03bcm image obtained using the Subaru\ntelescope showing biconical clouds extending out to 37 kpc,\nradiating H\u03b1+[NII] emission lines with a total H\u03b1+[NII]\nflux of 3.5 \u00d7 10\u221215 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 (Motohara et al. 2000),\ncorresponding to a luminosity of 6.7 \u00d7 1043 erg s\u22121 , (correcting to a cosmological scale of Ho = 75 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121\nand qo = 0.5). The H\u03b1+[NII] ionization cone, aligned with\nthe axis of the radio hot spots, implies the existence of a\nhidden, more luminous central source not observed in the\noptical, consistent with Keck spectropolarimetry data which\nsuggest the nucleus is extinguished and we are only seeing a\nyoung stellar population in direct optical light (Vernet et al.\n2001). The combination of these data suggest B3 0731+438\nis a powerful, radio-loud AGN with a large intrinsic absorption. Little is known about 3C 257.\n\nTARGET SELECTION\n\nThere is an observed correlation between L[OIII] (\u03bb5007)\nand the X-ray luminosity LX (2 \u2013 10 keV) in radio\nloud AGNs (Mulchaey et al. 1994; Sambruna, Eracleous\n& Mushotzky 1999). This relation indicates NLRGs with\nL[OIII] > 5 \u00d7 1043 erg s\u22121 will have an X-ray luminosity\nLX (2 \u2013 10 keV) > 5 \u00d7 1044 erg s\u22121 at the 90 % probability level. The relationship was used to select target NLRGs\nwhich are likely to host luminous AGNs and the two most luminous in [OIII] were chosen for observation. From the [OIII]\nluminosities (Evans 1998) the predicted X-ray luminosities\nfor B3 0731+438 (L[OIII] = 12.4 \u00d7 1043 erg s\u22121 ) and 3C 257\n(L[OIII] = 14.0 \u00d7 1043 erg s\u22121 ) were estimated to be greater\nthan 12 and 14 \u00d7 1044 erg s\u22121 respectively at the 90 % probability level. The width of the H\u03b1 line in the K-band spectra\nwas determined for both sources (Evans 1998; Jackson and\nRawlings 1997); B3 0731+438 shows no broad H\u03b1 compo-\n\n3\n\nOBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION\n\nB3 0731+438 and 3C 257 were observed during revolutions\n343 (22nd October 2001) and 370 (15th December 2001) of\nXMM-Newton respectively. The observations of the EPIC\nMOS and PN detectors for both sources were in full window\nmode using a medium filter. The data were screened with\nthe XMM Science Analysis Software (SAS) and pipeline processed. X-ray events corresponding to patterns 0 - 12 for the\ntwo MOS cameras and patterns 0 - 4, corresponding to single\nand double events for the PN were selected.\nWe then extracted the spectra and lightcurves for both\nthe source and background in each observation, separately\nfor each EPIC detector. Circular source regions of 1 arcmin\ndiameter for B3 0731+438 and 0.6 arcmin for 3C 257 were\nselected. The background regions were placed at positions\nclose to the sources and any significant flaring in the source\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fDetection of type-2 quasars in the radio galaxies B3 0731+438 and 3C 257\n\n3\n\nand background regions were then removed using time selections in XMMSELECT. We then coadded the MOS1 and\nMOS2 data into a single spectral file to maximize the signalto-noise ratio and grouped the data into a minimum of 20\ncounts per bin.\nThe total effective observing time for B3 0731+438 is\n22.75 ksec for PN and 27.40 ksec for both MOS1 and MOS2\nwith a source count rate of 0.01 cts/s for PN and 0.0033 cts/s\nfor the coadded MOS data. The effective observing time\nfor 3C 257 is 25.73 ksec for PN and 30.15 ksec for both\nMOS1 and MOS2, with a source count rate 0.0069 cts/s\nfor PN and 0.0028 cts/s for the coadded MOS data. Finally,\nthe background subtracted spectra were fitted using XSPEC\nversion 11.1.0ae with the latest response matrices.\n\n4\n\nSPECTRAL ANALYSIS\n\nThe spectral analysis was carried out in the conventional\nway. The data were compared with a range of parametric\nmodels until the best fit (best reduced \u03c72 ) was obtained.\nSeperate PN and MOS fits were carried out as a standard\ncheck for the fit and it was found that the data produced\nsimilar results to that of the coadded PN and MOS data.\nHereafter, we present fits only to the coadded data with one\nsigma errors quoted throughout.\n4.1\n\nFigure 1. The 0.3 \u2013 10 keV EPIC coadded MOS (MOS1 +\nMOS2) and PN spectrum of B3 0731+438 fitted with a partial\ncovering model (Model 3 in Table 1). The lower plot shows the\nratio of the data to the fitted model. For clarity, the data have\nbeen rebinned to 30 counts per bin.\n\nB3 0731+438\n\nInitially we fitted the coadded PN and MOS spectra\n(0.3 \u2013 10 keV) with a single powerlaw and neutral absorption (Galactic line-of-sight absorption) model; Model\n1 in Table 1. Table 1 also includes values for the powerlaw photon index (\u0393), the associated intrinsic column\ndensity (NH ), where appropriate, and values for \u03c72 and\nnumber of degrees of freedom in the fit. Using a galactic column density NH = 6.2 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 , Model 1\ngives \u0393 = 1.4 \u00b1 0.15 (\u03c72 /d.o.f = 29.15/32), suggesting\nsome intrinsic absorption. The unabsorbed flux and luminosity (2 \u2013 10 keV) were found from the fit to be\n3.2 \u00d7 10\u221214 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 and 2.8 \u00d7 1044 erg s\u22121 respectively.\nThe fit is improved (93 % significance) when intrinsic absorption is included in the spectral model; Model 2.\nThis produces a steeper underlying powerlaw, \u0393 \u2248 1.8 and\nNH \u2248 3.3 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 (\u03c72 /d.o.f = 26.11/31). This result\nsuggests the source has a possible intrinisically scattered\ncomponent, typical of a type-2 AGN. Therefore a partial\ncovering model was fitted; Model 3, consisting of intrinsically\nabsorbed and unabsorbed (scattered) powerlaw components.\nModel 3 provides an improved spectral fit for B3 0731+438\nat greater than 99.9 % significance, with \u0393 = 2.6 \u00b1 0.4 and\nNH = 1.9 \u00d7 1023 cm\u22122 \u00b1 0.7 (\u03c72 /d.o.f = 16.89/30). The unabsorbed X-ray luminosity (2 \u2013 10 keV) is 9.1 \u00d7 1044 erg s\u22121 .\nFigure 1 displays the best fit (Model 3) for B3 0731+438; the\npartial covering model. Figure 2 illustrates a contour plot of\nModel 3, showing the column density and X-ray luminosity distribution. The scattering efficiency was found to be\n11 % \u00b1 6 %. Constraining the scattering efficiency to 10 %\nwe find the results are consistent with the unconstrained fit.\nThese results are consistent with the low scattering efficiencies for Seyfert 2s (Lumsden et al. 2001).\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nFigure 2. A contour plot of column density against X-ray luminosity for B 0731+438 from Model 3. The confidence intervals\nshown are for 68, 90 and 99 %.\n\nThe spectra of B3 0731+438 may be consistent with a\nreflection dominated component, but fitting the data with\nthe reflection model PEXRAV (Magdziarz & Zdziarski 1995)\nrequires a very steep photon index of \u0393 \u2248 3.3 \u00b1 0.2 and\nno direct view of the incident continuum. If we assume the\nreflected component is \u2248 5 %, the implied upper limit on the\nintrinsic X-ray luminosity (2 \u2013 10 keV), is 5.6 \u00d7 1045 erg s\u22121\nif the planar reflection subtends 2\u03c0 sr at the illuminating\nsource. Fitting the data with a broad (1 keV) FeK\u03b1 emission\nline, we find a 90 % confidence upper limit on the intensity\nto be 2.7 \u00d7 10\u22126 photon s\u22121 cm\u22122 , corresponding to a restframe equivalent width of 263 eV. This equivalent width is\nlow, particularly for a type-2 object (Nandra et al. 1997;\nTurner et al. 1997).\n\n4.2\n\n3C 257\n\nThe analysis of the PN data for 3C 257 was complicated by\na residual spectral feature at \u2248 1.5 keV due to incomplete\nsubtraction of an internal detector background aluminium\nK-alpha line (Lumb et al. 2002). This line was removed from\n\n\f4\n\nP.M. Derry et al.\n\nFigure 3. The 0.3 \u2013 10 keV EPIC coadded MOS and PN spectrum of 3C 257 fitted with a partial covering model (Model 3,\nTable 1) binned to 20 counts per bin. The fit excludes the region\nfrom 1.4 \u2013 1.6 keV (see text).\n\nthe spectral fitting by ignoring energies in the range 1.4 \u2013\n1.6 keV for the 3C 257 PN data during the analysis.\nThe models used for B3 0731+438 were again used for\n3C 257. Model 1, the single powerlaw and neutral absorption model, using a Galactic value of NH = 4.4 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 ,\nproduced a very hard photon index \u0393 = 1.0 \u00b1 0.1\n(\u03c72 /d.o.f = 7.15/12). The flux and unabsorbed luminosity (2 \u2013 10 keV) obtained from the fit were\n2.6 \u00d7 10\u221214 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 and 1.5 \u00d7 1044 erg s\u22121 respectively. As in the case of B3 0731+438 the fit for 3C 257 is\nimproved, with a 90 % significance, when intrinsic absorption is included in the spectral model; Model 2. This again\nproduced a steeper underlying powerlaw with \u0393 \u2248 1.5 and\nNH \u2248 5.0 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 (\u03c72 /d.o.f = 4.04/11).\nWe then used the partial covering model, Model 3,\nbut it is not possible to distinguish between this model\nand Model 2. Since it was difficult to constrain the\nfit, we fixed the scattering efficiency to 10 %, consistent with that of B3 0731+438. We found \u0393 \u2248 1.4 and\nNH \u2248 5.5 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 with a corrected, unabsorbed Xray luminosity (2 \u2013 10 keV) = 2.6 \u00d7 1044 erg s\u22121 . Figure 3\ndisplays the spectrum of source 3C 257, fitted using Model\n3. Both models 2 and 3 suggest there is significant intrinsic\nabsorption in 3C 257.\nFitting the data with the reflection model PEXRAV\nrequires a steep photon index \u0393 \u2248 2.7 with no direct view\nof the incident continuum. Making the same assumptions as\nfor B3 0731+438 , the implied upper limit on the intrinsic\nX-ray luminosity (2 \u2013 10 keV), is 3.0 \u00d7 1045 erg s\u22121 .\n\n5\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe best-fit partial-scattering model for B3 0731+438 gives\nan intrinsic absorbing column of NH \u2248 1.9 \u00d7 1023 cm\u22122\nwhich is comparable to the column density suggested by\nRisaliti, Maiolino & Salvati, (1999) for type-2 Seyferts of\nNH > 1023 cm\u22122 . This model also gave a photon index of\n\u0393 \u2248 2.6. This value is steep, but is comparable to the typical\nquasar value of \u0393 = 1.9, at 90 % significance. Some luminous\nquasars have steep photon indices (e.g. \u0393 \u2248 2 for the quasar\nPDS 456 (Reeves et al. 1999)). For 3C 257 it was difficult to\n\nconstrain the fit as a result of the limited number of photons.\nHowever, the spectral fits are consistent with this source also\nhaving a large X-ray luminosity and intrinsic absorption.\nBoth sources appear less luminous than predicted based\non their [OIII] optical fluxes, but are still within the quasar\nrange. The optical to X-ray spectral index \u03b1ox was determined for B3 0731+438 using IR spectroscopy from Eales\n& Rawlings (1993) and Evans (1998). Assuming an optical\nextinction factor of Av = 1.9 (Motohara et al. 2000) and\nusing an absorption corrected X-ray flux, we calculate\n\u03b1ox = - 1.87 \u00b1 0.2, consistent with sources studied by Bechtold et al. (2002).\nFor B3 0731+438 we can compare the ionizing photon\nnumber derived by Motohara et al. (2000) with the observed\nX-ray continuum flux. Integrating a powerlaw of photon index 2.5, consistent with that used by Motohara et al. (2000),\nbetween 13.67 eV and infinity, normalised to the unabsorbed\nX-ray continuum, we derive a value of 1.7 \u00d7 1056 photons s\u22121 . Repeating this calculation with our derived value\nof \u03b1ox , extrapolating to 13.67 eV using the SED of Zheng et\nal. (1997), we derive a value of 1.0 \u00d7 1057 photons s\u22121 . These\nphoton numbers are consistent with the result obtained by\nMotohara et al. (2000), of > 2.1 \u00d7 1056 photons s\u22121 based\non the H\u03b1 luminosity, assuming case B and a unity covering\nfactor in the H\u03b1 cone (corrected to a cosmological scale of\nHo = 75 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 and qo = 0.5). We can also compare the X-ray and H\u03b1 luminosities assuming the relation\nthat the intrinsic X-ray luminosity (2 \u2013 10 keV) is approximately ten times that of the H\u03b1 luminosity (Ward et al.\n1988; Ho et al. 2001). Again correcting to a cosmological\nscale of Ho = 75 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 and qo = 0.5, Motohara\net al. (2000) found a H\u03b1 luminosity for B3 0731+438 of\n6.7 \u00d7 1043 erg s\u22121 , giving a predicted X-ray luminosity of\n6.7 \u00d7 1044 erg s\u22121 . This is in good agreement with our value\nobtained for B3 0731+438 of 9.1 \u00d7 1044 erg s\u22121 . These comparisons suggest the X-ray emission is fairly isotropic.\n\n6\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have presented XMM-Newton spectral analysis for the two NLRGs B3 0731+438 and 3C 257. The analysis of B3 0731+438 from fitting the spectra with a partial\ncovering model indicates a spectral index of \u0393 = 2.6 and a\nlarge column density NH \u2248 2 \u00d7 1023 cm\u22122 . As a result of\nfew counts, it was difficult to constrain the fit for 3C 257.\nHowever, the results suggest a large column density with a\nhard photon index, in agreement with an obscured source.\nBoth objects have large absorption corrected X-ray luminosities (2 \u2013 10 keV of 9 \u00d7 1044 erg s\u22121 for B3 0731+438\nand 2.6 \u00d7 1044 erg s\u22121 for 3C 257.\nIn summary, the analysis has shown that both objects\nhave intrinsic column densities and large X-ray luminosities\nwell within the type-2 quasar range. We therefore conclude\nB3 0731+438 and 3C 257 are examples of type-2 quasar and\ncurrently provide the best X-ray spectra obtained of such\nobjects with XMM-Newton.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fDetection of type-2 quasars in the radio galaxies B3 0731+438 and 3C 257\n7\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe work in this paper is based on observations with XMMNewton, an ESA science mission, with instruments and contributions directly funded by ESA and NASA.
