Experimental facilities now approach the region of\npossible discovery of the Higgs. There are even serious indications in favour of the Higgs\nmass MH = 115+1.3\n\u22120.9 GeV [2]. In view of these considerations it may be useful to study\nonce more possibilities, which differ from the standard Higgs mechanism and to look for\nexperimental consequences of these possibilities.\n\n1\n\n\fIn the present work1 we consider a model, which might serve a substitute for the\nStandard Model in respect to symmetry breaking. We are basing here on the proposal,\nwhich was done in work [3], the main point of which consists in application of N.N.\nBogolyubov method of quasi-averages [4] to a simple model. Let us summarize the essence\nof the approach [3] with some necessary corrections. Namely we consider U(1) massless\ngauge field A\u03bc and also massless spinor field \u03c8, which interact in the following way\n1\n\u0131\n(\u03c8\u0304\u03b3\u03c1 \u2202\u03c1 \u03c8 \u2212 \u2202\u03c1 \u03c8\u0304\u03b3\u03c1 \u03c8) \u2212 A\u03bc\u03bd A\u03bc\u03bd +\n2\n4\n+ eL \u03c8\u0304L \u03b3\u03c1 \u03c8L A\u03c1 + eR \u03c8\u0304R \u03b3\u03c1 \u03c8R A\u03c1 ;\nA\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc ;\n\nL =\n\n(1)\n\nwhere as usually\n\n1 + \u03b35\n1 \u2212 \u03b35\n\u03c8;\n\u03c8R =\n\u03c8.\n2\n2\nWe will not discuss here the problem of the triangle axial anomaly, bearing in mind that in\na more realistic model one always can arrange cancellation of the anomalies by a suitable\nchoice of fermions' charges, in the same way as it occurs in the Standard Model.\nNow we start to apply Bogolyubov quasi-averages method [4] 2 . In view of looking for\nsymmetry breaking we add to (1) additional term\n\u03c8L =\n\n\u01eb * \u03c8\u0304L \u03c8R \u03c8\u0304R \u03c8L .\n\n(2)\n\nNow let us consider the theory with \u01eb 6= 0, calculate necessary quantities (averages)\nand only at this stage take limit \u01eb \u2192 0. In this limit, according [4], we come to quasiaverages, which not always coincide with the corresponding averages, which one obtains\ndirectly from the initial Lagrangian (1).\nBecause of additional term (2) the following additional effective terms in Lagrangian (1)\ninevitably appear\n\u2206Lx = x * \u03c8\u0304L \u03b3\u03c1 \u03c8L \u03c8\u0304R \u03b3\u03c1 \u03c8R ;\nz\n\u2206Lz = * \u03c8\u0304R \u03b3\u03c1 \u03c8R \u03c8\u0304R \u03b3\u03c1 \u03c8R .\n2\n\n\u2206Ly =\n\ny\n* \u03c8\u0304L \u03b3\u03c1 \u03c8L \u03c8\u0304L \u03b3\u03c1 \u03c8L ;\n2\n(3)\n\nThe corresponding vertices should have form-factors, which define effective cut-off \u039b.\nThe origin of the cut-off is connected with self-consistent solution of the corresponding\ndynamical equations. A realization of this mechanism will be shown below in Appendix A.\nIn the present work we just set upper limit at Euclidean p2 = \u039b2 in momentum integrals.\nWe consider compensation equations [4, 6] (in other words, gap equations) for x, y, z\nin one-loop approximation (see Fig. 1), neglecting for the moment gauge field A\u03bc exchange\n1\n2\n\nThe work is supported in part by grant \"Universities of Russia\" 990588.\nThe quasi-averages method was first applied to quantum field theory problems in work [5].\n\n2\n\n\floops, and obtain following set of equations\n\u0011\n\u039b2 \u0010\n\u01eb\n2\n\u2212\n3\nx\n\u2212\n2\nx\n(y\n+\nz)\n;\n+\n2\n16\u03c0 2\n\u039b2 \u0010 2 \u0011\n\u039b2 \u0010 2 \u0011\ny =\n;\nz\n=\n\u2212\nx\n\u2212x ;\n16\u03c0 2\n16\u03c0 2\n\nx = \u2212\n\n(4)\n\nLet X, Y, Z be dimensionless variables\nX = x\n\n\u039b2\n;\n16\u03c0 2\n\nY = y\n\n\u039b2\n;\n16\u03c0 2\n\nZ = z\n\n\u039b2\n;\n16\u03c0 2\n\n(5)\n\nLet us look for solutions of set (4). At this stage we also set \u01eb \u2192 0. There is, of course,\ntrivial solution x = y = z = 0 . In addition we have two nontrivial solutions.\nZ1 = Y 1 = \u2212 1 ;\n1\n;\nZ2 = Y 2 = \u2212\n16\n\nX1 = 1 ;\nX2 = \u2212\n\n(6)\n1\n.\n4\n\n(7)\n\nAs we shall see further, just the second solution (7) will be the most interesting.\nNow let us consider scalar bound states (\u03c8\u0304L \u03c8R , \u03c8\u0304R \u03c8L ). Without e2 corrections we\nhave from Bethe-Salpeter equation in one-loop approximation (see Fig. 2)\nm2\nk2\n;\n\u03bc\n=\n;\n4\u039b2\n\u039b2\n5\n4\u03be\nF (\u03be) = 1 \u2212 \u03be + 2\u03be log\n;\n\u03bc \u226a \u03be < 1;\n2\n1+\u03be\n1\n\u03be \u2264 \u03bc.\nF (\u03be) = 1 + \u03be + 2\u03be log \u03bc + O(\u03be\u03bc, \u03be 2 ) ;\n3\nG = \u2212 4 X F (\u03be) G ;\n\n\u03be =\n\n(8)\n\nwhere G = const is just the Bethe-Salpeter wave function. Here m means a fermion\nmass, which will be shown to be nonzero, and k 2 is the scalar state Euclidean momentum\nsquared, that is k 2 > 0 means tachyon mass of the scalar. Function F (\u03be) decreases from\nthe value F (0) = 1 with \u03be increasing. We see, that for solution (7) we have bound state\nwith k 2 = 0 in full correspondence with Bogolyubov-Goldstone theorem [6], [7]. As for\nthe first solution (6), there is no solution of Eq. (8) at all. So we have to concentrate\nour attention on the solution (7). Note, that there is an additional argument in favour of\nsolution (7). Namely, values X and especially Y, Z are small enough, so we may expect,\nthat many-loop terms will not influence results strongly.\nNow let us take into account vector boson corrections. Equation for the bound state (8)\nis modified due to two sources. The first one corresponds to vector boson exchange loops\nin set (4). Here corrections appear, for example, of such form\n6 eL eR x\n\u039b2\nlog\n.\n16 \u03c0 2\np2\n3\n\n\fHere p is the momentum of integration in Eq. (8). In the present note we will restrict\nourselves by main logarithmic approximation, in which such terms do not contribute to\nresults. Indeed, due to simple relation\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u039b2\n\nxn log\n\n(\u039b2 )n+1\n\u039b2\ndx =\n;\nx\n(n + 1)2\n\n(9)\n\nthere is no logarithms in final expressions. So the only important contribution consists in\nloop e2 corrections to Eq. (8). In Landau gauge there is only one such contribution: the\ntriangle diagram. We draw at Fig. 2 only this diagram, but the gauge invariance of the\nresult is checked by direct calculations in an arbitrary gauge. So we now have\nG = F (\u03be) G +\n\n3 eL eR\n\u039b2\nlog\nG.\n16 \u03c0 2\nm2\n\n(10)\n\nWe see, that for small eL , eR possible eigenvalues \u03be are also small. Then we have following\ncondition for an eigenvalue\nF (\u03be) +\n\n\u039b2\n3 eL eR\nlog\n= 1;\n16 \u03c0 2\nm2\n\n(11)\n\nWe see, that there is tachyon bound state in case e2 contribution being positive.

Its form is marvelously simplified in the main order of 1/Nc expansion. So\nhere we consider just this approximation. Thus for the beginning we get equations for\nY1 , Y2\nNc\n2\nNc\nY2 =\n2\n\nY1 =\n\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u2212 Y22 \u2212 2Y12 \u2212 X12 \u2212 X22 \u2212 2Y1 Y2 ;\n\u0011\n\n\u2212 Y22 \u2212 2Y12 \u2212 X12 \u2212 X22 \u2212 2Y1 Y2 .\n\nThis means, that Y1 = Y2 = Y . For other variables we have\n\u0010\n\n(23)\n\n\u0011\n\nX1 = \u2212 Nc 3X1 Y + 2X1 Z1 + X2 Z12 ;\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nX2 = \u2212 Nc 3X2 Y + 2X2 Z2 + X1 Z12 ;\n\n\u0011\nNc \u0010 2\n5Y + X12 + X22 ; \u0232 = Y ; Z\u03041 = Z1 ; Z\u03042 = Z2 ;\n2\n\u0011\n\u0011\nNc \u0010 2\nNc \u0010 2\n2\n2\nZ1 = \u2212\n; Z2 = \u2212\n;\n4 Z1 + 2 X12 + Z12\n4 Z2 + 2 X22 + Z12\n2 \u0010\n2\n\u0011\n2\nZ12 = \u2212 2 Nc Z1 Z2 + Z1 Z12 + Z2 Z12 ; Z\u030412 = \u2212 Nc Z\u030412\n.\n\nY = \u2212\n\nX\u03041 = \u22124 Nc X\u030412 ;\n\nX\u03042 = \u22124 Nc X\u030422 ;\n6\n\n(24)\n\n(25)\n\n\fThe most important are equations for X\u03041,2 , which we mark separately. If we consider\nBethe-Salpeter equations for \u03c8\u0304L tR and \u03c8\u0304L bR scalar states again in the main order of 1/Nc\nexpansion, we have respectively\nG1 = \u2212 4 Nc X\u03041 F (\u03be) G1 ;\n\nG2 = \u2212 4 Nc X\u03042 F (\u03be) G2 ;\n\n\u03be =\n\nk2\n.\n4\u039b2\n\n(26)\n\nHere F (\u03be) is the same function as earlier (8). This means that in case of a non-trivial\nsolution of one of equations (25) we have zero mass Bogolyubov-Goldstone scalar doublet.\nInteraction with gauge vector fields according to (20) shifts the level to positive or negative\nvalues of the mass squared. Because of the bound state consisting of left and right spinors,\nonly interactions of B-boson enter to diagram Fig. 2. So if X\u03041 = \u2212 1/4Nc , we have\ntachyon state with\ng 2 tan2 \u03b8W 2\n\u039b .\n(27)\nm20 =\n24 \u03c0 2\nFor other possibility, i.e. X\u03042 = \u2212 1/4Nc (\u03c8\u0304L bR bound state), we have normal sign mass\nsquared\ng 2 tan2 \u03b8W 2\nm2Lb =\n\u039b .\n48 \u03c0 2\nAs we already know, the first possibility leads to Higgs-like symmetry breaking, that is to\nnegative minimum of the effective potential. As for the second case, there is no minima,\nso here we should take trivial solution X\u03042 = 0. It is very important point. Really, we\nhere obtain the explanation of why the t-quark is heavy and the b-quark is light. Only\nthe first possibility corresponds to tachyon and so gives condensate, leading to creation\nof masses including t-quark mass. The fact is connected with signs of interaction terms\nin (20). For us here only X\u03041 is important. It is easily seen from set (24) that for all other\nvariables we can take trivial solution X1 = X2 = ... = 0. One should expect, that the\nsituation might change in the next approximations.\nNext step is normalization of the bound state. Again following previous considerations (13, 14) we have the following normalization condition\nNc G21\n\u039b2\nlog\n= 1;\n16 \u03c0 2\nm2\n\n(28)\n\nNow we obtain fourfold scalar interaction constant \u03bb\n\u03bb =\n\nNc G41\n\u039b2\nlog\n.\n16 \u03c0 2\nm2\n\n(29)\n\nFor the moment we have everything for effective Higgs mechanism in our variant of\nthe Standard Model. We immediately come to classical scalar field density \u03b7\n\u03b72 =\n7\n\nm20\n;\n\u03bb\n\n(30)\n\n\fwhere parameters are uniquely defined (27, 28, 29). We also easily see, that constants\nof gauge interactions of the scalar doublet are just g for interaction with W and g \u2032 =\ng tan \u03b8W for interaction with B as usually. Now we have at once W, Z and t, b-quark\nmasses\nMW\nG1 \u03b7\ng\u03b7\n; MZ =\n; mt = \u221a ; mb = 0 .\nMW =\n(31)\n2\ncos \u03b8W\n2\nMass of surviving Higgs scalar\nMH2 = 2 m20 = 2 \u03bb \u03b7 2 =\n\n\u039b2\nNc G21 m2t\n.\nlog\n4 \u03c02\nm2t\n\n(32)\n\nFrom (27) we have\n3 \u03c0 cos2 \u03b8W 2\nMH ;\n\u03b1\nwhere as usually \u03b1 is the fine structure constant. From here and from (32) we have\n\u039b2 =\n\n3 G21\n3 \u03c0 cos2 \u03b8W\nR =\nlog\nR\n+\nlog\n4 \u03c02\n\u03b1\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n;\n\nR =\n\nMH2\n.\nm2t\n\n(33)\n\nNow let us discuss phenomenological aspects. We know all masses but that of the\nHiggs particle. To obtain it let us proceed as follows. From (31) we have\ng mt\nG1 = \u221a\n;\n2 MW\n\ng =\n\ns\n\n4\u03c0\u03b1\n= 0.648;\nsin2 \u03b8W\n\n\u03b1(MZ ) =\n\n1\n.\n129\n\n(34)\n\nThen for values mt = 174 \u00b1 5 GeV , MW = 80.3 GeV we have G1 = 0.993 \u00b1 0.032.\nSubstituting this into (33) we have from solution of the equation\nMH = 117.1 \u00b1 7.4 GeV .\n\n(35)\n\nFor example, for mt = 173 GeV we obtain MH = 115.6 GeV . Result (35) support\nindications of 115 GeV Higgs [2].\nHowever value G1 \u2243 1 does not fit normalization condition (28). From (28) G21\nis rather about 8 than about 1. So we conclude, that condition (28) contradicts to the\nobserved t-quark mass. We would emphasize , that the normalization condition is the\nonly flexible point in our approach. The next section will be devoted to discussion of this\nproblem.\n\n3\n\nNormalization condition\n\nScalar bound state in our approach consists of anti-doublet (tL , bL ) and singlet tR . It\nevidently has weak isotopic spin 1/2. Let us denote its field as \u03c6\n\u0010\n\n\u03c6 = b\u0304L tR\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03c6+ = t\u0304R bL\n\nt\u0304L tR ;\n8\n\n\u0011\n\nt\u0304R tL .\n\n(36)\n\n\fFrom the previous results we have the following terms in the effective Lagrangian\n\u2202\u03c6+ \u2202\u03c6\n+ m20 \u03c6+ \u03c6 \u2212 \u03bb (\u03c6+ \u03c6)2 ;\n\u2202x\u03bc \u2202x\u03bc\nNc G21\n\u039b2\nN =\nlog\n;\n16 \u03c0 2\nm2\n\nN\n\n(37)\n\nwhere parameters are defined in (27, 29). As for normalization parameter N, it does not\nsatisfy us. So we may study a possibility of quasi-averages effect for \u03c6 interactions, which\ncan change a coefficient afore the kinetic term. So, let us consider the following possible\ninteractions in addition to (37)\n\u03b701 \u2202\u03c6+ \u2202\u03c6\n\u03be01 \u2202\u03c6+ \u2202\u03c6\na\na\nW\nW\n+\nWa Wa ;\n2 \u2202x\u03bc \u2202x\u03bd \u03bc\u03c1 \u03bd\u03c1\n2 \u2202x\u03bc \u2202x\u03bc \u03bd\u03c1 \u03bd\u03c1\n\u03be00 \u2202\u03c6+ \u2202\u03c6 a a\n\u03b700 \u2202\u03c6+ \u2202\u03c6 a a\nLint (B) =\nB\nB\n+\nB B .\n2 \u2202x\u03bc \u2202x\u03bd \u03bc\u03c1 \u03bd\u03c1\n2 \u2202x\u03bc \u2202x\u03bc \u03bd\u03c1 \u03bd\u03c1\nLint (W ) =\n\n(38)\n(39)\n\nIn obtaining compensation equations we take into account possibility of triple W gauge\nbosons coupling, which was discussed in various papers (e.g. [10]) and, in particular, in a\nvariant of dynamical breaking of the electroweak symmetry, which the author considered\nsome time ago [8].

Table 1 contains\nresults of calculations for the case of trivial solution of set (44), i.e \u03be0 = \u03b70 = 0 (all\ncolumns but the last); this last column presents results for nontrivial solution of set (44):\n\u03be0 = \u2212 2.781, \u03b70 = \u2212 0.215.\nWhat are criteria for choosing a solution? The main criterion is provided by an energy\ndensity of a vacuum. We know, that in case of appearance of scalar Higgs condensate \u03b7\nthe vacuum energy density reads\nm4\nE = \u2212 0;\n(47)\n4\u03bb\nwhere parameters are defined in (27), (29). We see, that \u03bb is proportional to G41 , thus\nthe smaller is G1 and consequently mt , the deeper becomes the energy density minimum.\nTherefore we have to choose the solution, which leads to the minimal value of mt .\nFrom Table 1 we see, that for calculated value \u03bbV = \u2212\u03bb0 we have minimal mt in\ncomparison with two last lines. The last line but one corresponds to non-trivial solution\nwith \u03bbV = 0 and the last line give results for completely trivial solution (\u03bbV = \u03be = \u03b7 =\n0). Both ones give larger values for mt and thus are not suitable. The last column of the\ntable also corresponds to non-minimal values of G1 and thus the corresponding solutions\nare unstable.\nHowever, mt \u2243 470 GeV is too large, so let us look for values of \u03b6 = (\u03bbV /\u03bb0 )2 ,\nwhich give realistic values of the t-quark mass. Namely, values \u03b6 \u2243 1.42 \u00f7 1.43, (\u03bbV =\n\u2212 0.0342) give G1 to be just in correspondence with relation (34). So, contradiction of\n10\n\n\fthe normalization condition with value of the t-quark mass is removed. Thus we come\nto the conclusion, that we may not take into account of the normalization condition in\nconsidering estimates of composite Higgs mass, as it is done in the previous section.\nHow we can interpret the situation, when the desirable value for \u03bbV is about 20% larger,\nthan the calculated one? We would state, that corrections to the leading approximation,\nwhich is used here, might be just of this order of magnitude. To estimate the effect of\ncorrection let us consider contribution of usual electroweak triple W vertex\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nV\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 (p, q, k) = g g\u03bc\u03bd (q\u03c1 \u2212 p\u03c1 ) + g\u03bd\u03c1 (k\u03bc \u2212 q\u03bc ) + g\u03c1\u03bc (p\u03bd \u2212 k\u03bd ) ;\n(where p, q, k and \u03bc, \u03bd, \u03c1 are as usually incoming momenta and indices of W s) to compensation equation (41), which defines \u03bbV . In addition to diagram Fig. 3 we take three\ndiagrams, in which one of vertices is changed to V\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 . We have to add also contribution\nof four-W vertex, which is contained in triple vertex (40). This contribution restores the\ngauge invariance of the result. Thus we obtain a contribution, which is proportional to\ng/\u03c0. Namely, instead of (41) we now have\n\u03bbV = \u03bbV\n\ng\u03bbV\n2\nMW\n\nThat is, if \u03bbV 6= 0\n1 =\n\n!2\n\n\u03bbV\n\u03bb0\n\n\u039b4\n3 g g \u03bbV \u039b 2\n;\n+\n2\n128 \u03c0 2\n16 \u03c0 2 MW\n!\n\n!2\n\n3 g \u03bbV\n;\n+ \u221a\n2 \u03c0 \u03bb0\n\n(48)\n\nand from (48) we have\n\n3g\n.\n(49)\n\u03bbV \u2243 \u03bb0 \u00b1 1 \u2212 \u221a\n2 2\u03c0\nValue of g (34) gives the correction term here to be about 20%, what corresponds to\ndata presented in Table 1. We consider result (49) as qualitative argument for possibility\nof consistent description of data in the framework of our approach. Full study of this\nproblem needs special efforts. So for the moment one may only state, that value\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bbV \u2243 \u2212 0.034 ;\n\n(50)\n\nwhich excellently fits t-quark mass, is possible in the approach being considered here.\nSign of \u03bbV is chosen due to experimental limitations \u03bbV = \u2212 0.037 \u00b1 0.030 [11]. We\nsee, that our result (50) fits this restriction quite nicely. We consider this result (50) as a\nprediction for triple gauge coupling.\nWe have no proof that the possibility being discussed here is the only one, which can\nimprove situation with the normalization condition. However all other possibilities, which\nwere considered in the course of performing the work, lead to wrong sign of corresponding\ncontributions to this condition. That is t-quark mass becomes even larger, than 513 GeV .\nSo we are inclined to consider this possibility, especially prediction (50) as quite promising.\nIn any case we have an example of a variant, which has no contradiction with all what\nwe know.\n11\n\n\f4\n\nDiscussion\n\nThus as a result of our study of the model we now come to the theory, which describe\nStandard electroweak interaction of:\n1. gauge vector bosons sector with input of constants g and \u03b8W ;\n2. heavy quark doublet t, b with the t-quark mass 174 \u00b1 5 GeV and the b mass zero;\n3. necessary composite Higgs sector with mass of surviving neutral scalar particle MH =\n117 \u00b1 7 GeV .\nIn addition to these standard interactions there are also effective contact interactions,\nwhich act in momentum regions limited by effective cut-off \u039b \u2243 3500 GeV . We calculate\nthe last number e.g. from relation (27).\nThree parameters (g, \u03b8W , \u039b) are the only fundamental input of the model. As a\ntechnical input we consider triple gauge constant \u03bbV , which in range of 20% agrees with\nthe calculated value (42), but its precise value is defined by the next approximations.\nWe emphasize, that the presence of such interaction with constant (50) in the framework\nof the model is necessary. We consider result (50) as very important prediction of the\nmodel. Of course, the most important for the model is the prediction, that hints for\n115 GeV Higgs [2] have to be confirmed.\nIt is worthwhile here to comment the problem of accuracy of the approach. Our\napproximations are the following.\n1. One-loop diagrams. We estimate accuracy to be around X\u03041 \u2243 0.08.\n2. Corrections being of order of magnitude g/\u03c0 give uncertainty around 0.2.\n3. The leading order of 1/Nc expansion. Usually precision of 1/Nc expansion is estimated\nto be 1/Nc2 \u2243 0.11.\n4. We keep only logarithmic terms. Uncertainty is estimated to be 1/ log(\u039b2 /m2t ) \u2243 0.16.\nThus the combined accuracy, provided items 1 \u2013 4 being independent, is estimated to\nbe around 29%. As a matter of fact, all uncertainties, which we have encountered above\nfit into this range.\nFor the moment we have only one quark doublet. Remind, that now we understand\nwhy the t-quark is heavy and the b-quark is almost massless. We consider heavy t, b\ndoublet as the most fundamental one in the sense, that it defines the main part of heavy\nparticles masses. Indeed, composite Higgs scalars are just consisting of these quarks. We\nmay immediately introduce all other quarks and leptons with zero mass completely in the\nline prescribed by the Standard Model. So at this stage of study of the model we deal\nwith massive W, Z, t, H and massless all other particles. We may expect,that masses of\nquarks and leptons will appear in subsequent approximations. We have to expect their\nvalue to be less than 29% of our heavy masses, that is mi \u2264 23 GeV . All the masses\nknown satisfy this restriction. We could expect also, that in subsequent approximations\nHiggs scalars are not composed of only heavy quarks, but have admixture of lighter quarks\nand leptons.\nAdditional contact interactions (21) include four-fermion interactions of heavy quarks\n12\n\n\ft, b. So, there is practically no experimental limitations on the corresponding coupling\nconstant. Limitations exist only for contact interactions of light quarks. Limitations\nfor triple gauge interaction (40) were mentioned above and were shown to agree with\npredicted value (50). New contact interaction (38) deals with yet undiscovered Higgs\nscalars and therefore it is not a subject for experimental limitations. As an example we\nestimate cross-section of process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 H H in Appendix B.\nTo conclude the author would state, that the variant being studied presents a possibility to formulate realistic electroweak interaction without elementary scalars, which are\nsubstituted by composite effective scalar fields. The dynamics of the variant is defined\nin the framework of the Bogolyubov quasi-averages method. Definite predictions make\nchecks of the variant to be quite straightforward.\n\nAppendix\nA\n\nEffective cut-off\n\nLet us consider a theory with combination of four-fermion interactions (3). We take the\nsimplest nontrivial term in the Bethe-Salpeter equation for connected four-fermion amplitude, corresponding to Lorentz structure \u03c8\u0304L \u03b3\u03c1 \u03c8L \u03c8\u0304R \u03b3\u03c1 \u03c8R = \u2212 2 \u03c8\u0304L \u03c8R \u03c8\u0304R \u03c8L , which\nis presented at Fig. 6. The kernel for this equation corresponds to simple loop, which\ngives the following expression\nK(p, q) = \u0131\n\n3 x (y + z)\n(p \u2212 q)2 log (p \u2212 q)2 + const + O ((p \u2212 q)2 ).\n2\n16 \u03c0\n\n(51)\n\nWe are interested in momentum dependence, so we consider just the logarithmic term in\nthe kernel, i.e. the first term in Eq. (51), which we denote Klog (p, q). We shall see below,\nthat terms containing const and const (p \u2212 q)2 give zero contribution due to boundary\nconditions. Equation for four-fermion amplitude F(p), corresponding to Fig. 4, looks like\n(after applying of Wick rotation)\nZ\n(p \u2212 q)2 log(p \u2212 q)2 F (q) 4\nKlog (p, q) F (q) 4\nd q = \u03b2\nd q;\nF (p) = \u2212 \u0131\nq2\nq2\n3 x (y + z)\n\u03b2 =\n.\n16 \u03c0 2\nZ\n\n(52)\n\nEquations of such type can be studied in the same way as more simple equations with\nkernels being proportional to ((p \u2212 q)2 )\u22121 . The method to solve the latter ones was known\na long time ago [12]. For logarithmic case basic angular integrals are the following\nZ\n\n2\n\nd\u03a94 log(p \u2212 q) = \u03c0\n\n2\n\nx\ny\n+ 2 log x + \u03b8(y \u2212 x)\n+ 2 log y\n\u03b8(x \u2212 y)\nx\ny\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n13\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\u0013\n\n;\n\n\f\u03c02\ny2\nd\u03a94 (p q) log(p \u2212 q) =\n\u03b8(x \u2212 y)\n\u2212 3y\n3\nx\nx = p2 ,\ny = q2 .\n\nZ\n\n\u0012\n\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nx2\n+ \u03b8(y \u2212 x)\n\u2212 3x\ny\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\u0013\n\n; (53)\n\nIntegrals (53) are sufficient for angular integrations in equation (52). So we have\nF (x) =\n\n1\n\u03b2\n32 Z\u03c0 2 3 x\n\u0012\n\nx\n\n+ 2 x log x\nx2\n+\n3\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\nx\n\n0\n\nx\n\nZ\n\n0\n\ny 2 F (y) dy + 3\n\nF (y) dy + 2\n\nF (y)\ndy .\ny\n\u0013\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nx\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nx\n\ny F (y) dy + 2 log x\n\ny log y F (y) dy + x\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nx\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nx\n\ny F (y) dy +\n\n(3 + 2 log y) F (y) dy +\n(54)\n\nApplying differentiations in proper order, we obtain differential equation\n\u0011\n\u03b2 F (x)\nd3 \u0010 2 d3\nx\n(x\nF\n(x))\n= \u2212\n.\n3\n3\ndx\ndx\n8 \u03c02 x\n\n(55)\n\nEq.

The first one is connected with convergence of integrals at infinity.\nThe most intricate conditions are connected with behaviour at x \u2192 0. From Eq. (56) we\nsee, that at zero there are the following independent asymptotics:\na\u22121\n, a0 l log x, a0 , a1 l x log x, a1 x, a2 x2 .\nx\n\n(57)\n\nTo obtain conditions for ai one has to substitute into Eq.

Thus we come to conditions\na\u22121 = a0 l = a1 l = 0 .\nThese results, in particular, lead to zero values of integrals\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nF (y) dy =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\n14\n\ny F (y) dy = 0 ;\n\n(58)\n\n\fthat guarantees the absence of contributions of constant terms in the initial equation,\nwhich we have mentioned above.\nAccording to properties of Meijer functions [13] we have unique solution of Eq. (56)\nwith the boundary conditions (58)\n\u221a\n\u03c0 3 0\u0010\n\u03b2\n1\n1\n1\u0011\n;\ny =\nG0 6 y | 0, , 1 ; \u2212 , 0,\nx2 .\n(59)\nF (x) =\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n512 \u03c0\nThis function has all qualities of a form-factor. It is equal to unity at the origin and\ndecreases with oscillations at infinity.

Of course, it is done in the quasiladder approximation, but we think, that an account of non-linearities changes numbers,\nbut does not change the situation qualitatively. In the present work we will not go further\nand will not try to connect these considerations with realistic numbers.\n\nB\n\nPair H production\n\nIt is of interest to estimate possible effects of interactions (38, 39) in future experiments.\nWe take as an example process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 H H connected with these interactions. Indeed,\ndue to W W , BB loops, interactions (38), (39) lead to vertex \u0113e HH.
