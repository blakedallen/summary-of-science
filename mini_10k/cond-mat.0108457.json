The latter was inferred from\nmeasurements of Landau-Zener tunneling when the lattice depth was further reduced and/or the acceleration\nincreased. We loaded the condensate into optical lattices with different spatial periods, generating the periodic optical lattice either from two counter-propagating\nlaser beams or two laser beams enclosing an angle \u03b8 different from 180 deg.\nThe properties of a Bose-Einstein condensate located\nin a periodic optical lattice with depth U0 are described through the Gross-Pitaevskii equation valid for\nthe single-particle wavefunction [18]. In agreement with\nthe Bloch approach, the condensate excitation spectrum\nexhibits a band structure, and in the presence of an acceleration of the optical lattice Bloch oscillations of the\ncondensate should occur [4,6]. We present experimental\nevidence for Bloch oscillations preserving the condensate\nwavefunction. The nonlinear interaction of the condensate may be described through a dimensionless parameter [6,10,11] C = g/EB corresponding to the ratio of the\nnonlinear interaction term g = 4\u03c0n0 h\u03042 as /M and the lattice Bloch energy EB = h\u03042 (2\u03c0)2 /M d2 . The parameter\nC contains the peak condensate density n0 , the s-wave\nscattering length as , the atomic mass M , the lattice constant d = \u03c0/ sin(\u03b8/2)k, with k the laser wavenumber, and\n\u03b8 the angle between the two laser beams creating the 1D optical lattice. From this it follows that a small angle\n\u03b8 should result in a large interaction term C. In fact,\ncreating a lattice with \u03b8 = 29 deg allowed us to realize\na value of C larger by a factor of more than 10 with respect to [15] using a comparable condensate density. In\nthe following, the parameters d, EB and C always refer\nto the respective lattice geometries with angle \u03b8.\nThe role of the nonlinear interaction term of the GrossPitaevskii equation may be described through an effective\npotential in a non-interacting gas model [6,10]. In the\nperturbative regime of [6] the effective potential is\n\nWe have loaded Bose-Einstein condensates into onedimensional, off-resonant optical lattices and accelerated\nthem by chirping the frequency difference between the two lattice beams.

While in most of\nthe original optical lattice experiments the atomic clouds\nhad temperatures in the the micro-Kelvin range, corresponding to a few recoil energies of the atoms, samples with sub-recoil energies are now routinely produced\nin Bose-Einstein condensation experiments. Many aspects of Bose-Einstein condensed atomic clouds (BECs)\nhave been studied [3], ranging from collective excitations\nto superfluid properties and quantized vortices. So far,\nthe majority of these experiments have been carried out\nessentially in harmonic-oscillator potentials provided by\nmagnetic traps or optical dipole traps. The properties of\nBECs in periodic potentials constitute a vast new field of\nresearch (see, for instance, [4\u201312]). Several experiments\nin the pulsed standing wave regime [13,14] as well as studies of the tunneling of BECs out of the potential wells of\na shallow optical lattice in the presence of gravity [15],\nthe creation of squeezed states in condensates [16], and\nthe search for superfluid dynamics [17] have taken the\nfirst steps in that direction. In this paper, we present\nthe results of experiments on BECs of 87 Rb atoms in accelerated optical lattices. In particular, we demonstrate\ncoherent acceleration and Bloch oscillations of BECs adiabatically loaded into optical lattices and the reduction\nof the effective potential seen by the condensates due\n\nUeff = U0 /(1 + 4C),\n\n(1)\n\nso that the potential seen by the condensate is U (x) =\nUeff sin(2\u03c0x/d)+const. We therefore expect that for large\nvalues of C, i.e. large mean-field effects, the effective\noptical lattice potential acting on the condensate should\nbe significantly reduced.\n\n1\n\n\frate (\u2248 10 s\u22121 ) was negligible during the interaction\ntimes of a few milliseconds. In our experimental setup,\nwe realized a counter-propagating lattice geometry with\n\u03b8 = 180 deg and an angle geometry with \u03b8 = 29 deg,\nleading to lattice constants d of 0.39 and 1.56 \u03bcm, respectively [21]. Inserting a peak condensate density of\nn0 \u2248 1014 cm\u22123 (typical of trap frequencies > 100 Hz) in\nthe Thomas-Fermi limit into the expression for the interaction parameter C leads to C = 0.06 for the counterpropagating configuration and C = 0.25 for \u03b8 = 29 deg.\nIn order to determine the lattice depth at low condensate\ndensities, we measured the Rabi frequency on a first order\nBragg resonance [13]. Typically, for well-aligned lattice\nbeams we measured lattice depths up to 20% lower than\nthe theoretically expected value inferred from the laser\nintensity and detuning. These discrepancies are within\nthe calibration error of our laser power measurements.\nIn order to accelerate the condensate, we adiabatically\nloaded it into the lattice by switching one of the lattice\nbeams on suddenly and ramping the intensity of the other\nbeam from 0 to its final value in 200 \u03bcs [22]. Thereafter, the linear increase of the detuning \u03b4 provided a\nd\u03b4\n\u03bb\nconstant acceleration a = 2 sin(\u03b8/2)\ndt of the optical lat\u03bb\n\u03b4f ,\ntice, leading to a final lattice velocity vlat = 2 sin(\u03b8/2)\nwhere \u03b4f is the final detuning between the beams. After\na few milliseconds of acceleration, the lattice beams were\nswitched off and the condensate was imaged after another\n10 \u2212 15 ms of free fall. As the lattice can only transfer\nmomentum to the atoms in the condensate in units of\nthe Bloch momentum pB = h\u0304(2\u03c0/d), the acceleration\nof the condensate showed up as diffraction peaks corresponding to higher momentum classes as time increased.\nSince for our magnetic trap parameters the initial momentum spread of the condensate (which is transferred\ninto a spread of the lattice quasimomentum during an\nadiabatic switch-on) was much less than a recoil momentum of the optical lattice, the different momentum classes\n|p = \u00b1npB i (where n = 0, 1, 2, ...) occupied by the condensate wavefunction could be resolved directly after the\ntime-of-flight (see, for instance, the peaks corresponding\nto n = 0 and n = 1 in Fig. 1(a)). As described in [23], the\nacceleration process within a periodic potential can also\nbe viewed as a succession of adiabatic rapid passages between momentum states |\u00b1npB i. We observed a momentum transfer of up to 6 pB without a detectable reduction\nof the phase-space density of the condensate. We verified that in the process of the acceleration and tunneling,\nthe condensed fraction was not reduced for low condensate densities. Our investigation did not, however, test\nthe evolution of the condensate phase, but on the basis\nof the Bragg scattering experiments of [13] we assume\nthat the interaction times of our experiment should not\ndestroy the condensate phase.\n\nFIG.\n1.\nCondensate\nacceleration\nin\nthe counter-propagating optical potential. Shown here are\ntypical time-of-flight images for moderate, n0 < 1014 cm\u22123 ,\nin (a) and high condensate density, n0 > 2 \u00d7 1014 cm\u22123 , in\n(b). The two-peaked coherent structure in (a) is easily interpretable within the periodic potential diffraction picture\ngiving rise to two momentum classes, whereas the more complicated pattern in (b) cannot be described by this simple\nmodel.\n\nOur apparatus used to achieve Bose-Einstein condensation of 87 Rb is described in detail in [19]. Essentially, 5 \u00d7 107 atoms captured in a magneto-optical trap\n(MOT) were transferred into a triaxial time-orbiting potential trap (TOP) [20]. Subsequently, the atoms were\nevaporatively cooled down to the transition temperature\nfor Bose-Einstein condensation, and after further cooling we obtained condensates of \u2248 104 atoms without a\ndiscernible thermal component in a magnetic trap with\nfrequencies around 15 \u2212 30 Hz. In one set of experiments,\nthe magnetic trap was then switched off and a horizontal\n1-D optical lattice was switched on, while in the other\ncase the interaction between the condensate and the lattice took place inside the magnetic trap, which was subsequently switched off to allow time-of-flight imaging. The\nlattice direction was parallel to the strong axis of the\ntrap, and the lattice beams were created by a 50 mW\ndiode slave-laser injected by a grating-stabilized masterlaser blue-detuned by \u2206 \u2248 28 \u2212 35 GHz from the 87 Rb\nresonance line. After passage through an optical fibre,\nthe laser light was split and passed through two acoustooptic modulators (AOMs) that were separately controlled\nby two phase-locked RF function generators operating at\nfrequencies around 80 MHz, with a frequency difference\n\u03b4. The first-order output beams of the AOMs generated\nthe optical lattice, and an acceleration of the lattice was\neffected by applying a linear ramp to \u03b4.\nFor the values of the detuning and laser intensity used\nin our experiment, the spontaneous photon scattering\n2\n\n\finside the magnetic trap, eliminating the velocity of the\ncondensate relative to the lattice by phase-modulating\none of the lattice beams at the same frequency and in\nphase with the rotating bias field of the TOP trap. In\nthis way, in the rest frame of the lattice the micromotion\nwas compensated. Nevertheless, a residual sloshing of the\ncondensate with amplitudes < 3 \u03bcm could not be ruled\nout, so that the uncertainty in the initial velocity of the\ncondensate was still around 0.5 mm s\u22121 , corresponding to\n\u2248 0.15 vB in this geometry. Fig. 2 (c) shows the results of\na measurement of the acceleration of the condensate as a\nfunction of the final lattice velocity for a theoretical lattice depth of U0 \u2248 1.38 EB together with the theoretical\ncurves for the same potential and the (assumed) effective\npotential Ueff \u2248 0.65 U0 \u2248 0.88 EB as calculated from the\ncondensate density using the perturbative expression of\nEq.

The experimental results for the counter-propagating (triangles)\nand angle geometries (squares) are plotted together with\nthe theoretical predictions (solid and dashed lines, respectively). Parameters in these experiments were a = 23.4 m s\u22122\nand U0 = 0.28 EB for the counter-propagating lattice and\na = 3.23 m s\u22122 and U0 = 0.71 EB for the angle geometry.\n\nThe average velocity of the condensate was derived\nfrom the occupation numbers of the different momentum states. Figure 2 shows the results of the acceleration of a condensate in the counter-propagating lattice\nwith Ueff = 0.29 EB and a = 9.81 m s\u22122. In the restframe of the lattice (Fig. 2 (b)), one clearly sees Bloch\noscillations of the condensate velocity corresponding to a\nh\nBloch-period \u03c4B = MRb\nad = 1.2 ms. The shape of these\noscillations agrees well with the theoretical curve calculated from the lowest energy band of the lattice.\nWhen the experiment was repeated in the angleconfiguration of the lattice, larger values of the lattice\ndepth in units of the Bloch energy EB could be realized.\nBecause of the reduced Bloch velocity vB in this geometry, the acceleration process was extremely sensitive to\nany initial velocity of the condensate, which in our TOP\ntrap is intrinsically given by the micromotion [20] at the\nfrequency of the bias field. For the trap parameters used\nin our experiments, the velocity amplitude of the micromotion could be of the same order of magnitude as vB\nand the condensates could, therefore, have quasimomenta\nclose to the edge of the Brillouin zone. In order to counteract this, we performed the acceleration experiments\n\nIn order to measure more accurately the variation of\nthe effective potential Ueff with the interaction parameter\nC, we studied Landau-Zener tunneling out of the lowest\nBloch band for small lattice depths in both geometries.\nTo this end, the acceleration of the lattice was increased\nin such a way that when the condensate crossed the edge\nof the Brillouin zone, an appreciable fraction of the atoms\ntunneled across the band gap into the first excited band\n(and, therefore, effectively to the continuum, as the gaps\nbetween higher bands are negligible for the shallow potentials used here). According to Landau-Zener theory,\nthis fraction is [23]\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\n\u03c0Ueff\n,\n(2)\nr = exp \u2212\n8h\u0304pB a\n3\n\n\fgiving a velocity vm = (1 \u2212 r)vB of the condensate at\nthe end of the acceleration process for a final velocity\nvB of the lattice [24]. We verified that this formula correctly described the tunneling of the condensate in our\nexperiment by varying both the potential depth and acceleration.\nThereafter, we studied the variation of the final mean\nvelocity vm as a function of the condensate density for\nthe two lattice geometries. The density was varied by\nchanging the mean frequency of the magnetic trap (from\n\u2248 25 Hz to \u2248 100 Hz). From the mean velocity the effective potential was then calculated using the LandauZener formula given above. Fig. 3 shows the ratio Ueff /U0\nas a function of the peak density n0 for the counterpropagating geometry and the angle-geometry. As expected, the reduction of the effective potential is much\nlarger in the angle geometry. The theoretical predictions\nof Eq. (1) are also shown in the figure, with the potential\nU0 calculated taking into account losses at the cell windows and imperfections of the polarizations of the lattice\nbeams. The residual combined error due to uncertainties\nin the absolute intensity measurements, the position of\nthe beam axes relative to the position of the BEC and\na small initial velocity due to sloshing of the BEC in\nthe magnetic trap, as well as a systematic error due to\nthe difference in position of about 300 \u03bcm of the condensate between the weakest and the strongest trap used,\nwas estimated at about 20%. Within these experimental uncertainties, qualitative agreement with theory was\ngood [25]. Although we could realize peak densities up\nto 4 \u00d7 1014 cm\u22123 by using larger trap frequencies, data\npoints for n0 > 1014 cm\u22123 in the counter-propagating\nlattice and n0 > 5 \u00d7 1013 cm\u22123 in the angle geometry\nwere not included in the graph as the resulting diffraction\npatterns were not easily interpretable within the simple\nmodel described above (see Fig. 1(b)).\nIn summary, we have investigated the coherent acceleration and Bloch oscillations of Bose-Einstein condensates\nadiabatically loaded into a 1-D optical lattice. Through\nLandau-Zener tunneling out of the lowest Bloch band, we\nhave studied the dependence of the effective potential on\nthe interaction parameter C. The results obtained are\nin good qualitative agreement with the available theories\nand extend the experimental work on ultra-cold atoms in\noptical lattices into the domain of Bose-Einstein condensates. In order to improve the theoretical description of\nour experiment, the finite extent of the condensate leading to the occupation of only a few lattice sites and the\nthree-dimensional nature of the condensate evolution as\nwell as the role of the interaction term in the adiabaticity\ncriterion for switching on the lattice will have to be taken\ninto account.\nThis work was supported by the MURST through the\nPRIN2000 Initiative, by the INFM through the Progetto di Ricerca Avanzata 'Photon Matter', and by the\nEU through the Cold Quantum-Gases Network, contract\n\nHPRN-CT-2000-00125.

[23] refers to interband\ntransitions due to the rate of change of the band energies\nof non-interacting particles. This criterion was extended\nin [6] to the condensate on the basis of the band energies for the effective potential. However, other criteria\nsuch as collective excitations of the condensate [4] or the\nperturbation of the global condensate phase ( [16] and\nC. Williams, private communication), may impose more\nstringent conditions but have not been considered here.\n\n4\n\n\fIn the Landau-Zener tunneling experiments, we extended\nthe ramping time to 3 ms.\n[23] M.

A 55, 2989 (1997).\n[24] These expressions are only exact if the final velocity of\nthe lattice is an integer multiple of vB , as in that case\nthe mean velocity of the condensate is independent of\nthe band structure.\n[25] The theoretical analysis of ref. [6] assumes a uniform condensate density, while in our experiment there is a spatial\ndependence of the density due to the harmonic trapping\npotential. In calculating the theoretical values for Ueff /U0\nthrough the parameter C, we used the peak density of the\ncondensate.\n\n5\n\n\f"}
