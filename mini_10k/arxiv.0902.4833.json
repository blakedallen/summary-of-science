Zamolodchikov), Moscow, June 2008\n\u2217\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe problem of solving two-dimensional quantum gravity exists already more than twenty, or\neven more than twenty-five years. By its basic definition one usually takes the Polyakov path\nintegral [1], where the integration over the metrics on two-dimensional string world-sheets has\nbeen reduced to study of naively simple, but in fact quite nontrivial two-dimensional conformal\nLiouville field theory. The world-sheet approach allowed to determine immediately only the\nrelatively simple quantities - like scaling dimensions - of the operators of the two-dimensional\nquantum gravity [2, 3]. The computation of their correlators - even on the world-sheets of\nsimplest spherical topology - appeared to be the problem of much higher complexity, and was\n(yet only partially) solved very recently.\nFortunately, the two-dimensional quantum gravity is a renormalizable theory - in the most\nphysically important sense of the word, which means that the details of regularization of the\ntheory at microscopic scale do not affect its macroscopic properties: the \"observable\" scaling\ndimensions and correlators. In different words, two dimensional quantum gravity possesses\nstrong universality property - meaning that quite different methods of the computation gives\nrise basically to the same result.\nThe first sign of this was observed already in the middle of 80-s of the last century. The\nidea of summing over the discrete triangulations of world sheets instead of the integrations over\nthe metric in continuous theory had demonstrated its efficiency in two-dimensional case, quite\nin contrast with the nonrenormalizable gravity of higher dimensions. Moreover, it turned out\nthat summing over triangulations of the two-dimensional surfaces can be itself reformulated as\nsumming over the fat graphs of the matrix models [4]. The duality between matrix model (the\nzero-dimensional gauge theory) and continuous two-dimensional world-sheet gravity is in fact\nnothing but the first studied example of the famous nowadays gauge/string duality.\nBy the matrix model approach two-dimensional quantum gravity was claimed to be \"completely solved\" [5] in the beginning of 90-s of the previous century. This solution was nicely\nformulated [6, 7] in terms of special stringy solutions to the hierarchies of integrable equations,\nbeing all the well-known polynomial reductions of the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) hierarchy.\nIn practice, this has opened a possibility to compute exactly the correlators in two-dimensional\ngravity (in the framework of \"matrix model\" approach) at least in the spherical approximation\n(when all closed string loops are suppressed) by methods of dispersionless KP hierarchy, which\nturn this problem into the problem of solving algebraic nonlinear equations. Below, following\n[8], we shall demonstrate how this way leads straightforwardly to the computation of invariant correlation numbers - the ratios of the correlation functions which do not depend upon\nnormalizations of particular operators.\nHowever, it is still a great puzzle and, at least partially, an open problem, whether the\nmatrix model approach leads exactly to the same results as the original world-sheet approach.\nPartially this is related to the fact, that the world-sheet quantum Liouville theory of [1] is\n\n1\n\n\fa rather specific two-dimensional quantum field theory, which is yet to be fully understood.\nThe two- and three- point functions in Liouville theory were computed in early 90-s [9, 10],\nbut it turned out, that only after discovery of the higher order equations of motion by Alesha\nZamolodchikov [11], it appeared to be possible to compute the generic multipoint correlation\nfunctions of the operators of minimal (p, q) models coupled to the two-dimensional Liouville\ngravity, where the integrands on the moduli spaces of world-sheets with punctures are basically\nreduced after using the higher order equations to the total derivatives.\nThese correlation functions could be now compared with the results extracted from the\n\"matrix model\" approach, or more strictly, from the formulation of minimal string theory in\nthe language of integrable hierarchies.\n\n2\n\ndKP for (p,q)-critical points\n\nAccording to widely beleived hypothesis, the so called (p, q) critical points of two-dimensional\ngravity (or (p, q) minimal string theory) are most effectively described by the tau-function of\np-reduced KP hierarchy, satisfying string equation. The logarithm of this tau-function should\nbe further expanded around certain background values of the time-variables, with necessary\ntp+q 6= 0. In particular, it means that the correlators on world-sheets of spherical topology\n(the only ones, partially computed by now by means of two-dimensional conformal field theory\n[11, 12]) are governed by quasiclassical tau-function of dispersionless KP or dKP hierarchy,\nwhich is a very reduced case of generic quasiclassical hierarchy from [13].\nFor each (p, q)-th minimal theory one should consider a solution of the p-reduced dKP\np\nhierarchy, or more strictly, its expansion in the vicinity of nonvanishing tp+q = p+q\nand vanishing\nother times, perhaps except for cosmological constant x, chosen in a different way for the\ndifferent theories (the so called conformal backgrounds). If q = p + 1 (the unitary series)\nthe cosmological constants x \u223c t1 basically coincides with the main first time of the KP\nhierarchy, but for \"non-unitary\" backgrounds the quantum numbers change, and this causes\ncertain nontrivial relations on the space of KP solutions to be discussed below.\n\n2.1\n\nResidue formulas\n\nThe geometric formulation of results for minimal string theories in terms of the quasiclassical\nhierarchy can be sketched in the following way:\n\u2022 For each (p, q)-th point take a pair of polynomials\nX = \u03bbp + . . .\nY = \u03bbq + . . .\n2\n\n(1)\n\n\fof degrees p and q respectively. They can be thought of as a dispersionless version of the\nLax and Orlov-Shulman operators of KP theory\nh\ni\nX\u0302, \u0176 = ~\n(2)\np\nq\nX\u0302 = \u2202 + . . . , \u0176 = \u2202 + . . .\nor as a pair of (here already integrated) Krichever differentials with the fixed periods on\na complex curve (for dKP - a rational curve with global uniformizing parameter \u03bb). It is\nalso convenient to combine these polynomials into a generating differential\ndS = Y dX\n\n(3)\n\nwhose periods and singularities define the variables of the quasiclassical hierarchy. Since\non rational curve (\u03bb-plane or Riemann sphere with the marked point P0 , where \u03bb = \u221e)\nall periods of (3) vanish, the time variables are related with the residues or singular part\nof expansion of the differential dS at the point P0 .\n\u2022 The variables of dispersionless KP hierarchy are therefore introduced by residue formulas\n[13, 14, 15]\n1\ntk = resP0 \u03be \u2212k dS, k > 0\nk\n(4)\n\u2202F\n= resP0 \u03be k dS, k > 0\n\u2202tk\nwhere\n\u0013 p1\n\u0012\n1\nX\n0\n(5)\n\u03be = Xp = \u03bb 1 + ...+ p\n\u03bb\nis the distinguished inverse local co-ordinate at the point P0 , where \u03bb(P0 ) = \u221e and\n\u03be(P0) = \u221e. From (4) it also follows for the second derivatives\n\u22022F\n= resP0 (\u03be k dHn )\n\u2202tn \u2202tk\nwhile the third derivatives are given by the formula\n\u0012\n\u0013\ndHk dHl dHn\n\u22023F\n= resdX=0\n\u2202tk \u2202tl \u2202tn\ndXdY\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\nIn (6) and (7) the set of one-forms\ndHk =\n\n\u2202dS\n,\n\u2202tk\n\nk\u22651\n\n(8)\n\n(derivatives are taken at fixed X) corresponds to dispersionless limit of KP flows and can\nbe integrated up to polynomial expressions\nk/p\n\nHk = X(\u03bb)+\nin uniformizing co-ordinate \u03bb = H1 .\n3\n\n(9)\n\n\fNote also, that the tau-functions of (p, q) and (q, p) theories do not coincide, but are related by\nthe Legendre or Fourier transform [16], exchanging the polynomials (1) by each other X \u2194 Y .\n\n2.2\n\nSolution to dKP\n\nThe fact, that one-forms (8) can be integrated up to the polynomials (9) leads to explicit\nexpression for the integrated generating differential (3), or\nS=\n\np+q\nX\nk=1\n\ntk Hk =\n\np+q\nX\n\ntk X k/p (\u03bb)+ ,\n\nk mod p\n\n(10)\n\nk=1\n\ndepending already upon the coefficients of the polynomial X(\u03bb) only. In different words, formula\n(10) means, that the first part of the equations (4) has been already effectively\nresolved for the\nP\nk\ncoefficients of Y (\u03bb). The dependence of coefficients of X(\u03bb) = \u03bbp + p\u22122\nX\n\u03bb\nover the KP\nk\nk=0\ntimes (4) is determined in the most easy way from dS|dX=0 = 0, which is now a system of p \u2212 1\n\"hodograph\" equations dS\n= 0 imposed at p \u2212 1 roots of X \u2032 (\u03bb) = 0.\nd\u03bb\n\nA simple observation, that any hamiltonian (9) is a polynomial in terms of the variable\n2F\n\u03bb = H1 leads to dispersionless Hirota equations, which express any second derivative \u2202t\u2202k \u2202t\nn\n2F\nwhere\none\nof\nthe\nindices\nis\nfixed\nwith arbitrary k and l in terms of the second derivatives \u2202t\u2202k \u2202t\n1\nand corresponds to the first time. From formulas (4) one finds that\n\u0013\nX\u0012\n\u2202F d\u03be\nk\u22121\n(11)\ndS =\nktk \u03be d\u03be +\n\u03be\u2192\u221e\n\u2202tk \u03be k+1\n\nwhich is just an expansion in local co-ordinate at the marked point P0 . Taking the time\nderivatives (cf. with (8)) gives the set\nX \u22022F 1\n\u2202S\nk\nHk =\n=\u03be \u2212\n= \u03be k (\u03bb)+ ,\nj\n\u2202tk\n\u2202tk \u2202tj j\u03be\nj\n\nk>0\n\n(12)\n\nwhich forms a basis of meromorphic functions with poles at the point P0 , or just a particular\npolynomial basis, explicitly fixed by last equation. The set of the powers \u03bbk has the same singularities as the set of functions (12), i.e. these two are related by simple linear transformation,\ne.g.\n\u22022F\nH1 = \u03bb, H2 = \u03bb2 + 2 2 ,\n\u2202t1\n(13)\n2\n2\n\u2202 F\n3 \u2202 F\n3\nH3 = \u03bb + 3 2 \u03bb +\n, ...\n\u2202t1\n2 \u2202t1 \u2202t2\nThese equalities follow from the comparison of the singular at P0 part of their expansions in\n\u03be, following from (12). Comparing the negative \"tails\" of the expansion in \u03be of both sides of\n4\n\n\f2\n\nF\neq.

These relations are called the dispersionless KP, or the dKP Hirota\nequations, e.g.\n\u0012\n\u00132\n3 2 3 \u22022F\n\u22022F\n= X0 =\n\u2202t1 \u2202t3\n8\n2 \u2202t21\n(14)\n\u0012 2 \u00133\n3 3\n\u2202 F\n\u22022F\n= X0 = 3\n\u2202t3 \u2202t3\n8\n\u2202t21\n\nWe have listed here those, which will be of some interest for two-dimensional quantum gravity.\n\n2.3\n\nScaling\n\nUnder the scaling X \u2192 \u039bp X, Y \u2192 \u039bq Y , (induced by \u03bb \u2192 \u039b\u03bb and therefore \u03be \u2192 \u039b\u03be), the\ntimes (4) transform as tk \u2192 \u039bp+q\u2212k tk .

Moreover, since both theories have\np + q = 7, they have identical scaling in the first KP variable (15), which originally has cause\na confusion, when distinguishing these two minimal string theories. In particular, that origins\nfrom the fact that string equations of those two models can be obtained from each other by\nsimple reparameterization in the space of couplings, as we have noticed already in the previous\nsection.\nHowever, the physical sense of parameters, arising in these two equations is totally different.\nOne can say, that the same KP time variable has different \"quantum numbers\", when one takes\na solution, corresponding to a different critical point. For example, the role of cosmological\nconstant, coupled to a unity operator on world-sheet is played by t1 in (3, 4) Ising, but by t3 in\nthe (2, 5) Yang-Lee theory. Below we shall try to present more details about this relation and\ndescribe it as much as possible from the point of view of (dispersionless) KP theory.\n\n4.1\n\nKostov equation\n\nThis is a name, given by Alesha Zamolodchikov to a \"phenomenological\" transcendental equa2\ntion, satisfied by the second derivative of free energy over the cosmological constant u \u223c \u2202\u2202xF2\nof the form\nu\u03bd + tu\u03bd\u22121 = x\n(68)\np\n. For the cases of interest one gets integer \u03bd(2, 3) = 2 for pure gravity\nwhere \u03bd = \u03bd(p, q) = q\u2212p\nand \u03bd(3, 4) = 3 for Ising (both are unitary with q = p + 1), but \u03bd(2, 5) = 23 .\n\nHence, for the Ising model the Kostov equation reads\nu3I + tI u2I = xI\n\n(69)\n2\n\nand coincides (after renormalization xI \u223c t1 , tI \u223c t5 and uI \u223c X1 = 3 \u2202\u2202tF2 , below in this section\n1\nwe shall use different normalization from conventional in KP theory, to get rid of ugly numerical\nconstants) with the Boulatov-Kazakov equation (62) when t2 = 0, i.e. for vanishing magnetic\nfield.\n2/3\n\n\u22121/3\n\nFor the Yang-Lee model equation (68) uY L + tY L uY L = xY L after the substitution uY L =\n3\nvY L turns into\nvY3 L \u2212 xY L vY L = \u2212tY L\n(70)\nwhich coincides (again, up to a similar renormalization of couplings) with the Yang-Lee string\n2\nequation (35) upon t3 \u223c xY L , t1 \u223c tY L and X0 = 2 \u2202\u2202tF2 \u223c vY L .\n1\n\n14\n\n\fComparing (70) with (69) one finds that, as we have already done in the previous section,\none may indeed identify uI with vY L after appropriate shifts of the variables (66) and pointing\nout the change of the quantum numbers: t1 \u223c xI \u223c tY L and t3 \u223c t2I \u223c xY L .\n\nThe relation uY L \u223c vY3 L is quite clear from the point of view of equations (14). It is just a\nparticular Hirota equation for dispersionless KP hierarchy, expressing\nuY L\n\n\u22022F\n\u223c\n=3\n\u2202t23\n\n\u0012\n\n\u22022F\n\u2202t21\n\n\u00133\n\n\u223c vY3 L\n\n(71)\n\nthe function satisfying equation (68), and being here a double derivative of free energy w.r.t\nthe third time of the hierarchy, in terms of the canonical KP potential, being always a double\nderivative w.r.t. the first time.\nFrom the point of view of KP theory it is also rather clear, why equation (68) is applicable\n2\n. When\nonly for p < q < 2p, in particular only for K = 2, 3 with \u03bd(2, 2K \u2212 1) = 2K\u22123\ntransforming it to conventional KdV string equation (20), like it was done in (70) for the YangLee model, one finds that the variable t should be generally identified with t7\u22122K -th time of\nKP hierarchy, which does not have clear sense at K > 3.\n\n4.2\n\nZamolodchikov curve for Ising\n\nIf all parameters of the gravitational Ising model are \"alive\", the best way is to study, following\n[19], the fixed area partition function\nZ\nZ\ndx\ndu\nxa\nZa =\nue = \u2212\nexa\n2\u03c0ia\n2\u03c0ia2\n(72)\nH2\n3 2\n3\nx = u + Tu +\n2\n(u + T )2\nwhere we use again the rescaled variables x = xI \u223c t1 , H \u223c t2 , T \u223c t5 and the rescaled\n2\ndx\nBoulatov-Kazakov equation (57) for u \u223c \u2202\u2202xF2 . The saddle point equation du\n= 0 for the\nintegral in (72) is given by\n2\n(73)\nu(u + T )4 = H 2 \u2261 \u03be 2 T 5\n3\nIn rescaled variables u \u223c T U, the saddle point equation (73) presents a Riemann surface\nU(U + 1)4 = \u03be 2\n\n(74)\n\nwhich is a double-cover of the Uc -plane and a 5-sheet cover of the \"magnetic\" plane \u03be, and the\nfunction x on the curve (74) contains description of all singularities in the gravitational Ising\nmodel [23].\n\n15\n\n\fIn particular, the Yang-Lee\nsingularity arises at critical value of magnetic field H = Hc ,\nq\n2 Hc\nwhere two values \u03bec = 3 T 5/2 = \u00b1i 516\n5/2 correspond to two points on the curve (74)\n1\nUc = \u2212 ,\n5\n\nwhere\n\nd\u03be\n=0.\ndU U =Uc\n\n\u03bec2 = Uc (Uc + 1)4 = \u2212\n\n44\n55\n\nAt the Yang-Lee point one also obviously has\n\n7\n5\n625 3\nx = \u2212 T 3 + (U \u2212 Uc )3 + . . . = xc +\nT\n50\n2\n128\n\n\u0012\n\n(75)\nd2 x\ndU 2\n\n\u03be 2 \u2212 \u03bec2\n2\n\nU =Uc\n\n\u00133/2\n\n= 0, and\n+ ...\n\n(76)\n\nc\nso that X \u223c x\u2212x\n\u223c \u03bc3/2 scales as the right fractional power of the cosmological constant\nT3\n3/2\nxY L = \u03bc \u223c \u03be \u2212 \u03bec in the Yang-Lee model, corresponding to the well-known scaling t1 \u223c t3 of\nKP times at the critical point with p + q = 7. For the expansion of Boulatov-Kazakov equation\none can now write\nX\n(77)\n\u223c \u03bcV + V 3 + O(\u01eb)\n3\n\u01eb\nwhere H \u2212 Hc \u223c \u01eb2 \u03bc, U + 15 \u223c \u01ebV , i.e. the Zamolodchikov curve in the vicinity of the Yang-Lee\nsingularity is described, up to renormalization of parameters, by string equation (35).\n\n5\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe have tried to demonstrate in this paper, that all spherical correlation functions in quantum\nLiouville gravity are all contained and can be easily extracted from the \"science of polynomials\"\n- dispersionless KP hierarchy. A simple collection of residue formulas allows to extract the\ninvariant ratios, to be further compared with the correlation functions in world-sheet theory,\nwhich can be now also computed - though in a much more cumbersome way - mostly due to\nthe results of Alesha Zamolodchikov in Liouville theory.\nSuch application of classical integrable science to the problems of two-dimensional quantum\nphysics is already a step towards dynamical physics from topological strings, where similar\nscience has been already used with visible success, see e.g. [25, 17, 18, 26, 27, 28].\nThe most nontrivial point in application of this \"integrable science\" is its interpretation\nin terms of the world-sheet theory. The first point concerns resonances [21, 22], which allow\nnonlinear relations between the couplings in KP and world-sheet theories when the fractions of\nthe KPZ scaling dimensions of couplings [2] are integer. We have observed this phenomenon in\nthe cases of (2, 7) and (3, 4) minimal theories, where it is yet quite easy taken into account by\njust playing with the residue formulas for one- two- and three-point functions. Naively, these\nresonance reparameterizations look as particular W -flows in the space of couplings, but this\nquestion deserves further investigation.\n16\n\n\fAnother nontrivial point is related to the fact that KP times may have different physical\nsense, or different quantum numbers, when we expand a KP solution around different backgrounds, corresponding to particular minimal theories. We have noticed this, say, when comparing the formulations for the gravitational Ising and Yang-Lee models. This is the simplest\nobservation for a very important generic fact that physical observables may change their quantum numbers, when effective field theory is moved in the moduli space - like in four-dimensional\nsupersymmetric gauge theories electrically charged objects may capture magnetic charges and\nvice versa. Two dimensional quantum gravity is therefore a good laboratory for studying such\neffects.\nFinally, let us say few words, how the picture of dispersionless KP for the minimal string\ntheory could be deformed towards quasiclassical hierarchies of generic nonsingular type. An\ninvariant way to look at the basic polynomials X = \u03bbp + . . . and Y = \u03bbq + . . . (1) is to say, that\nthey satisfy an algebraic equation\nX\nY p \u2212 Xq \u2212\nfij X i Y j = 0\n(78)\n\nwith some particular coefficients {fij }. Generally, for arbitrary coefficients this is a smooth\ncurve of genus\n(p \u2212 1)(q \u2212 1)\n(79)\ng=\n2\nwhich is a resolution or desingularization of the situation, when X and Y can be parameterized as polynomial of a uniformizing global variable \u03bb. This number coincides with the\nnumber of primaries in corresponding minimal conformal (p, q) theory. Such curves can be\nobtained, say, by reduction of the curve of two-matrix model\nP5 [24]. j An interesting example\n2\n7\nis the hyperelliptic curve of the (2, 7) model Y = X + j=0 fj X , satisfied by (46) with\nthe coefficients fj = fj (X0 , Y1 , Y3), j = 0, . . . , 5. At vanishing times (except for t9 = 2/9,\n\u00012\nsee (47)), it shrinks to a cusp Y 2 = X 7 , or Y 2 = X 3 X 2 + 5t25 for nonvanishing cosmological t5 , which is however \"resolved\" by passing to worldsheet times t1 \u2192 t1 + 25\nt2 as\n28 5\n\u0011\n\u0010\n2\n2\n3\nwith u2 = \u2212 20t7 5 . This form directly generalizes\nY 2 = (X \u2212 u) X 3 + u2 X 2 \u2212 u2 X \u2212 u8\n\u00112\n\u0010\n2\nthe curve of the Yang-Lee model Y 2 = (X \u2212 u) X 2 \u2212 u2 X + u4\nfor (33) with u2 = \u2212 12t5 3\nproportional to nonvanishing cosmological time.\nFor such\nH curves, the residue formulas we have discussed above should be extended by period\nintegrals Y dX along all nontrivial cycles on the curve (78). The sense of such period integrals\nis analogous to the Seiberg-Witten periods or the filling fractions in matrix models. As usually\nin quasiclassical hierarchies, the appearance of corresponding period variables reflect increasing\nnumber of unfrozen coefficients in the equation (78) or new deformations of the background of\nthe minimal string theories. The study of such deformations is again a long-standing, but still\nan open problem.\nAcknowledgements.
