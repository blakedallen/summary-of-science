In particular, many approaches have been developed for characterizing and understanding the nature of chaotic\nmotion [1].\nIn addition to chaotic behavior, it has also been shown that deterministic systems can\nexhibit anomalous transport and strange kinetics [2, 3, 4, 5]. In analogy with stochastic\nprocesses, in the case of normal diffusion [6, 7], the mean square displacement < x2 > is\nproportional to time t (< x2 >\u223c t), while in the case of strange kinetics [3, 4, 8], < x2 >\u223c t\u03b3 ,\nwith \u03b3 > 2 for enhanced diffusion and 1 < \u03b3 < 2 for dispersive motion. The mean square\ndisplacement can also have a logarithmic dependence on time, corresponding to \u03b3 = 0\n[9, 10]. Strange kinetics as well as diffusive motion have been observed in both deterministic\nnonlinear systems [11, 12, 13, 14, 15] as well as thermal ratchets [16].\nIn this paper we concentrate on the dynamics of a deterministic thermal ratchet in the\npresence of a driving force. It has recently been shown [16] that quenched disorder induces a\nnormal diffusive kinetics in addition to the drift due to the external drive. Moreover this diffusive motion is enhanced by higher values of the quenched disorder. If the quenched disorder\nhas long-range spatial correlations, diffusion becomes anomalous, and both the correlation\ndegree and the amount of quenched disorder can enhance the anomalous diffusive transport\n[17]. Anomalous transport has been found recently in overdamped systems [18, 19]. In Linder et al [18] an anomalous coherence is reported and P. Reimann et al [19] find divergence\non the diffusion coefficient. Although our system differs from those previously reported due\nto the presence of quenched disorder and driving force, the transport anomaly presents some\nsimilarities that will be discussed below. While anomalous transport in quenched disorder\nratchets was observed for a range of values of the parameters, the mechanism leading to\nthis unusual behavior has not been investigated. Transport properties of ratchets (for a\nrecent review of ratchets, see [20]) is a topic of great current interest, due to the possible\napplication of these models for understanding such systems as molecular motors [21, 22],\nnanoscale friction [23, 24, 25], surface smoothening [26], coupled Josephson junctions [27],\nas well as mass separation and trapping at the microscale [28, 29, 30, 31]. The fluctuations that produce the net transport are usually associated with noise, but they may arise\n2\n\n\falso in absence of noise, with additive forcing, in overdamped deterministic systems [32],\noverdamped quenched systems [16] and in underdamped ratchets [33, 34, 35, 36].\nThe aim of this paper is to show that a trapping mechanism is responsible for the observed\ndispersive anomalous transport in an overdamped ratchet subject to an external oscillatory\ndrive [37]. In particular, we show that this mechanism appears when the quenched disorder\nstrength is greater than a threshold value. The minimum disorder strength required for the\nexistence of traps is determined by studying the trap structure in a disorder configuration\nspace. An approximation to the trapping probability density function in a disordered region\nof finite length included in an otherwise perfect ratchet lattice is obtained. We show that due\nto this trapping mechanism, the mean velocity of the particles and the diffusion coefficient\nhave a non-monotonic dependence on the quenched noise strength.\nThe outline of the paper is as follows: in section II we present the single particle model, in\nsection III we define the ensemble and the cumulants, in section IV we present the trapping\nmechanism and discuss its consequences in section V. Conclusions are presented in section\nVI.\n\nII.\n\nMODEL\n\nThe motion of a single particle in an overdamped disordered media is modeled by an\noverdamped ratchet subject to an external oscillatory drive in the presence of a quenched\nnoise, using the dynamical equation:\n\u03b3 \u1e8b = R(x) + F (t) + G(x)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere, \u03b3 is the damping coefficient, R(x) = \u2212dU/dx is the ratchet force, F (t) is the time\ndependent external force and G(x) is the quenched disorder force.\nThe periodic, asymmetric, ratchet potential is modeled by the equation:\nU(x) = \u2212 sin(x) \u2212\n\n\u03bc\nsin(2x).\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwith the spatial period \u03bb = 2\u03c0, as in previous works [16, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38]. The external\noscillatory force is given by:\nF (t) = \u0393 sin(\u03c9t),\n\n3\n\n(3)\n\n\fwhere \u0393 and \u03c9 are the amplitude and the frequency of the oscillations, respectively. The\neffects of the substrate randomness is modeled by a quenched disorder term of the form:\nG(x) = \u03b1\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03be(i)[H(x \u2212 i\u03bb) \u2212 H(x \u2212 (i + 1)\u03bb)],\n\n(4)\n\ni=\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere the coefficient \u03b1 \u2265 0 is the quenched disorder strength, H is the Heaviside function\nand \u03be(i) are independent, uniformly distributed random numbers in [\u22121, 1]. The extension\nto correlated disorder is straightforward. The force G(x) is a piecewise constant force for\nevery period of the ratchet potential and gives a reasonably realistic representation of the\neffects of the substrate.\nIn order to carry out a numerical solution of Eq. 1 we have carried out a fourth order\nfixed step Runge-Kutta method [39]. Since we are interested in the influence of \u0393 and \u03b1 on\nthe transport properties of the system, the remaining parameters are set to the following\nvalues, which were used in previous works [16, 36, 37, 40]:\n\u03b3 = 1; \u03bc = 0.5; \u03c9 = 0.1.\n\n(5)\n\nWe have carried out numerical solutions of the evolution equation using the following dimensionless variables:\n\u2022 The dimensionless position x\ne = x/\u03bb, which gives the position of the particle along the\nvalleys of the ratchet potential.\n\n\u2022 The dimensionless velocity e\nv = v/v\u03c9 , with v\u03c9 = \u03bb/T . The mean value of e\nv gives the\ntransport velocity of a particle along the ratchet.\n\n\u2022 The discrete sequences obtained by sampling x\ne and e\nv with a sampling period Tsa =\nT = 2\u03c0/\u03c9:\n\nx\nesa = x\ne(kT ) ;\n\nvsa = ve(kT ) ,\ne\n\n(6)\n\nwith (k=0,1,2,...). Using these variables it is possible to detect synchronization with\nthe external driving force.\nA typical trajectory of Eq. 1 consists of an oscillation superimposed on a directed transport motion with average speed < e\nv >. The particular case of < e\nv >= 0 indicates no\ntransport along the ratchet.\n\n4\n\n\fIn a perfect lattice (i.e. \u03b1 = 0) massless particles remain synchronized over the entire\n[\u0393, \u03c9] parameter space [40]. The bifurcation diagrams of vesa and < e\nv > as a function of \u0393\nare shown in Fig.1 for \u0393 in the range [0, 2]. Fig.1 shows that vesa is a monotonic increasing\n\nfunction of \u0393 and < e\nv > is a stepped function with jumps at specific \u0393 values. The meaning\n\nof these jumps may be understood by considering how the particle's position x\ne varies as a\nfunction of time e\nt. When \u0393 is below 0.96 the particle starts in a potential valley and oscillates\n\ninside the valley in synchrony with the external driving force, returning every T to the same\nposition inside the valley. The particle also has the same velocity. This synchronism explains\nwhy only one value of e\nvsa is obtained: at every sampling time the velocity of the particle\nhas the same value within its oscillatory motion.\n\nOver the region \u0393 \u2208 [0.96, 1.22], every \u0393 value has only one value for e\nvsa but now <\n\nv >= 1, showing that the particle remains synchronized with the external driving force but\ne\n\nnow it advances one spatial period (one valley) during T . As \u0393 further increases the particle\n\nadvances 2 valleys, and then 3 valleys during each T (see the labels (+2, \u22120) and (+3, \u22120) in\nFig.1), giving < e\nv >= 2 and < e\nv >= 3, respectively. Furthermore it remains synchronized\n\ngiving only one value of vesa . If \u0393 further increases, < e\nv > jumps to a lower value, because\n\nduring the positive half cycle the particle goes forward, crossing several valleys, but it returns\nto one or more valleys during the negative half cycle. This explains the labels in Fig. 1.\nThe motion of the particle remains synchronized with the external force through the entire\nrange [0, 2] as it is shown by the single value of e\nvsa .\nIII.\n\nCOLLECTIVE MOTION\n\nWe have studied the evolution of an ensemble of noninteracting particles, uniformly distributed over one whole potential valley. The initial position of the particles is given by the\nparticle density function:\n\u03c1(x, 0) = [H(x\u0303 \u2212 x\u0303min ) \u2212 H(x\u0303 \u2212 x\u0303max )],\n\n(7)\n\nwith x\u0303max = x\u0303min + 1.\nThe ensemble was allowed to evolve up to a time t\u0303 = 1000, while the positions of the\nparticles were obtained at times t\u0303k = 10k (k = 0, 1, ...) and stored for further analysis. In\norder to perform averages over the realizations of disorder a different quenched disorder\n5\n\n\fsequence was used for each trajectory . In this way, the average over the trajectories also\nincludes an average over different realizations of the disorder.\nTo characterize the evolution of the packet, the first two cumulants,\n\nand their temporal derivatives,\n\ne1 = he\ne2 = x\ne12 ;\nC\nxk i ; C\ne2k \u2212 C\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\ne1 /de\ne = lim t \u2192 \u221e dC\ne2 /de\nhV i = lim t \u2192 \u221e dC\nt ; D\nt\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\nwere evaluated at the sampling times as a function of time. Here hV i is the mean velocity\ne is the diffusion coefficient. In all cases considered, it was verified that all higher-order\nand D\n\ncumulants increase slower than tn/2 , ensuring that \u03c1(x, t) is asymptotically a Gaussian and\ncan be determined using the first two moments only.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE TRAPPING MECHANISM\n\nThe superposition of the force F (t), with zero temporal mean, and the force R(x) with a\nzero spatial mean value, allows the particles to move at different speeds along the potential.\nConsequently, in spite of the zero spatial mean value of the force R(x) produced by the\nratchet potential:\n1\nhRixe =\nN\n\nx\nf\nZ1 +N\n\nR(e\nx)de\nx=\n\n1\n[U (e\nx + N) \u2212 U (e\nx)] = 0,\nN\n\n(10)\n\nx\nf1\n\nthe time-averaged mean value felt by the particles is not zero and is given by:\n1\nhRiet =\nN\n\ne1 +1\ntZ\nte1\n\n\u0002\n\u0001\u0003\nR x\ne e\nt de\nt.\n\n(11)\n\nThis is in fact the reason a sinusoidal driving force produces a positive drift motion when it\nis combined with the ratchet potential.\nA significant consequence of the quenched disorder is the appearance of a trapping mechanism, which arises only in the disordered case (\u03b1 6= 0). Traps are a small number of\ncontiguous valleys with a negative time-averaged quenched-disorder mean-value, that exactly compensate the positive time-averaged mean-value of the ratchet potential force. This\n6\n\n\ftrapping can be predicted from the synchronization analysis of the perfect lattice case. As\nan example let us consider the case \u0393 = 1.65. This \u0393 corresponds to the synchronization\nzone (+3,-1) in Fig.1. When \u03b1 6= 0 a particle feels a force that is a combination of the\nratchet force plus a sinusoidal force with variable amplitude \u0393eq between \u0393 \u2212 \u03b1 and \u0393 + \u03b1.\nThus, disorder enables the particle reach different zones, as can be seen in Fig. 1. For\nexample, for \u03b1 = 0.1, the available regions for a particle are (+3, \u22120) and (+3, \u22121). Then\nthe possible values of < e\nv > are a result of the combination of the positive and the negative\n\nterms: +3 \u22120 = 3 and +3 \u22121 = 2. Thus, e\nv is bounded between 2 and 3. For \u03b1 = \u03b1z \u2243 0.175\nthe available regions become (+2, \u22120), (+3, \u22120), (+3, \u22121), (+4, \u22121), and (+4, \u22122). Then\n\nthe possible values of < ve > are: +4 \u2212 0 = 4, +4 \u2212 1 = 3, +4 \u2212 2 = 2, +3 \u2212 0 = 3,\n\n+3 \u2212 1 = 2, +3 \u2212 2 = 1, +2 \u2212 1 = 1, +2 \u2212 2 = 0. Since zero is a possible value, then the\nparticle can be localized or trapped. This corresponds to a particle going forward 2 valleys\nduring the positive half cycle and going backwards 2 valleys during the negative half cycle.\nConsequently, the trapped particle oscillates inside three valleys in synchrony with the external driving force. While this analysis is not exact, it provides a reasonable explanation\nfor both the minimal disorder strength and the corresponding length K in which particles\ncan be trapped.\nIn order to determine the trapping probability, we will first define the quenched disorder\nforces G(x) of Eq. 1, in one of K consecutive valleys, as the coordinate of a K-dimensional\ndisorder configuration space. Possible combinations of disorder are studied in this space\n\nand each combination is classified either as a trap or a non-trap. For example for \u0393 = 1.65\nK = 3; then all possible combinations of three consecutive valleys were studied. The results\nare shown in a K = 3 disorder configuration space in Fig. 2. Note that the trapping region\nin this space changes shape as \u03b1 increases from 0.2 in Fig. 2(a) to 0.3 in Fig. 2(c). For low\nvalues of \u03b1 there are no traps at all. At a critical value of \u03b1 \u223c\n= \u03b2K = \u03b23 the first trap appears\n(see Fig.2a). Let us call this trap the basic trap as it consists of K consecutive valleys with\nequal disorder strength (for the case \u0393 = 1, 65, K = 3 and \u03b23 \u223c\n= 0.136).\nNote that the volume of the trapping configuration region further increases with increasing\n\u03b1 (see Fig. 2b). For \u03b1 = \u03b2K\u22121 = \u03b22 \u223c\n= 0.21 (see Fig. 2c), two arms appear, corresponding\nto traps of only K \u2212 1 consecutive valleys (for the case \u0393 = 1.65, K \u2212 1 = 2). If \u03b1 is further\nincreased, there exists a higher value \u03b2K\u22122 = \u03b21 over which traps of only one valley appear.\nNote that the minimum \u03b1 for which traps appear is \u03b2K\n7\n\n\fWhen K = 2, the disorder configuration space is two-dimensional. Traps appear when\n\u03b1 > \u03b2K = \u03b22 . In the interval \u03b22 < \u03b1 < \u03b21 , the probability space (that corresponds to\ntrapping events) gradually mutates from a single triangular shape into a square as \u03b1 grows.\nWhen \u03b1 > \u03b21 , two narrow, rectangle-shaped arms appear, because it is possible now for a\nparticle to get trapped in just one valley. We note that, in Fig. 2, in which a K = 3 case\nis considered, the \u03b21 value is outside the plotting range. If \u03b21 had been included in the plot\nthree rectangular prisms would have appeared, one for each random variable. For instance,\nthe prism that corresponds to valley number 1 would have occupied the volume:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\u2212\u03b1 < \u03b1\u03be1 < \u2212\u03b21 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec \u2212\u03b1 < \u03b1\u03be2 < \u03b1 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\u2212\u03b1 < \u03b1\u03be2 < \u03b1\n\n.\n\n(12)\n\nFor each \u03b1 value the cumulative probability of trapping in a K-length trap, called p(\u03b1, K),\nis evaluated as the ratio between the volume of the trapping region and (2\u03b1)K .\nWhen a disordered region of finite length L > K is considered the cumulative probability\nof trapping is approximately given by:\nP (\u03b1, K, L) = 1 \u2212 Q(\u03b1, K, L),\nL\u2212K+1\n.\nQ(\u03b1, K, L) \u223c\n= (1 \u2212 p(\u03b1, K))\n\n(13)\n\nThe approximation used to obtain Eq. 13 is based on the assumption that the events of\nactual trapping of the particle in the neighborhood of the K-length traps are independent.\nLet F (\u03b1, L) be the fraction of particles traversing the length L of the disordered region.\nWe define f (\u03b1, L) by the relation:\nf (\u03b1, L) = d [1 \u2212 F (\u03b1, L)] /d\u03b1.\n\n(14)\n\nIn Fig. 3, f (\u03b1, L) is compared with dP (\u03b1, K, L)/d\u03b1 with the values of P (\u03b1, K, L) obtained\nfrom Eq. 13. The good agreement between the two results confirms that the independent\nevents approximation used in Eq. 13 is clearly valid for \u03b1 values below \u03b2K\u22121 . Note that the\nlocal maximum of both curves in Fig. 3 occurs at \u03b2K\u22121 \u2243 0.21, corresponding to the value\nat which the \"arms\" begin to appear in the disorder-configuration space (see Fig. 2b). We\nnote that the value \u03b2K\u22122 \u2243 0.5720, where K \u2212 2 valley length traps appear, falls outside the\nrange of the plotted values.\n8\n\n\fAs the disorder region length L grows, the shape of Figure 3 becomes thinner but its left\nend is still at \u03b1 = \u03b2K (in this case, \u03b1 = \u03b23 ). If L tends to infinity the probability that a\nparticle finds a K-length trap tends to unity when \u03b1 = \u03b2K . Then, the shape of figure 3\nbecomes a Dirac delta function, which is also predicted by Eqs. 13 and 14.\nWe have carried out similar studies for many other values of \u0393 in the range [0, 2]. We have\nfound that in most of the cases studied, the correlation effects are not important and Eq. 13\nis accurate enough for determining the probability density function P (\u03b1, K, L). There are\na few \u0393 values, however, for which the correlation effects cannot be easily neglected, since\n\u03b2K \u2243 \u03b2K\u22121 and the \"arms\" in the disorder configuration space (like the one in figure 2)\nappear early on.\nAs seen in Fig. 4, Eq. 13 is not accurate when \u03b1 >> \u03b2K . This is because the correlations cannot be neglected in this region. We propose another method, which we call\nthe Conditional-Probability Method or CPM, that takes the correlations into account. This\nmethod is always accurate provided that \u03b1 >> \u03b21 but for some \u0393 values it also works well\nin the entire \u03b1 > \u03b21 range.\nCalculations based on CPM involve the following steps: 1) Approximate the probability\nspace volume occupied by trapping events (both black and gray dots in Fig. 3), by a\npolyhedron in which the faces are perpendicular to the coordinate axes. The \u03b1 > \u03b21 case\nmust be considered and rectangle prisms are the main volume component. The smaller\nvolume components are optionally considered, if the method's range of valid \u03b1 values is to\nbe increased. If K = 2 we have a probability space enclosed by a surface with faces that are\nperpendicular to the coordinate axes. 2) Write the volume equations of the non-trapping\nevents, that is the volume outside the polyhedron, as the union of the set of volumes. The\nprobability of having no traps is proportional to this volume. For example, let us consider\nthe \u0393 = 1.35 case for which K = 2. The non-trapping probability Q(\u03b1, K, L) = Q(\u03b1, 2, 2)\nagrees approximately with:\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u2212\u03b2\n<\n\u03b1\u03be\n<\n\u03b1\n1\n1\n\uf8f8.\nQ(\u03b1, 2, 2)(4\u03b12) = \uf8ed\n\u2212\u03b21 < \u03b1\u03be2 < \u03b1\n\n(15)\n\nIf the smaller surface of trapping events approximately given by\n\u2212 \u03b21 < \u03b1\u03be1 < \u2212\u03b22 , \u2212\u03b21 < \u03b1\u03be2 < \u2212\u03b22\nis taken into account we can instead write:\n9\n\n(16)\n\n\f\uf8ee\uf8eb\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8f6\uf8f9\n[\n[\n\u2212\u03b22 < \u03b1\u03be1 < \u03b1\n\u2212\u03b22 < \u03b1\u03be1 < \u03b1\n\u2212\u03b2 < \u03b1\u03be1 < \u2212\u03b22\n\uf8f8 \uf8ed\n\uf8f8 \uf8ed 1\n\uf8f8\uf8fb .\nQ(\u03b1, 2, 2)(4\u03b12) = \uf8f0\uf8ed\n\u2212\u03b22 < \u03b1\u03be2 < \u03b1\n\u2212\u03b21 < \u03b1\u03be2 < \u2212\u03b22\n\u2212\u03b22 < \u03b1\u03be2 < \u03b1\n(17)\n3) Increase L, sequentially, in single steps, and find the new volume as the intersection\nof the previous volumes. That is, Q(\u03b1, K, L \u2212 1).(2\u03b1)(L\u22121) , expanded for all \u03b1\u03beL and the\noriginal K-dimensional volume expanded for all \u03b1\u03be1 , \u03b1\u03be2 , ...., \u03b1\u03beL\u2212K values.

Finally\nthe intersection between these 4D hyper-volumes must be found.\nAs L grows, the number of component hyper-volumes in the set increases and their\nintersections are hard to calculate by hand. We calculated the resultant hyper-volume up to\nL = 15 by using a binary method in which intersections are 'and' boolean operators. Fig. 4\nshows that there is excellent agreement when \u03b1 > \u03b21 for L = 15.\n\nV.\n\nCONNECTION BETWEEN TRAPPING AND TRANSPORT PROPERTIES\n\nThe presence of the traps has a significant macroscopic consequence in multiparticle\ne In order to\nsystems on the variation of the current hVe i and the diffusion coefficient D.\ne1 and C\ne2 , shown in Fig. 5, as a function\nexplain this consequence, consider the cumulants C\n\nof time for a packet of 2200 massless particles with \u0393 = 1.65, \u03c9 = 0.1, \u03b3 = 1, L = 50 and\ne >, are plotted as a function of\n\u03bc = 0.5. The corresponding derivatives < Ve > and < D\n\n\u03b1 in Figs. 6a - 6c. We note that as a function of \u03b1, four regions with different transport\nproperties may be recognized in these figures:\n1) Very low disorder strength region, \u03b1 \u2264 0.08. In this region the disorder has no effect\ne1 is proportional to e\n(see the case \u03b1 = 0.06 in Fig. 5), the first cummulant C\nt and there is\ne2 and the zero value of < D\ne > (see Fig.\nno diffusion as evidenced by the constant value of C\n\n6c). Particles can only reach the region (+3, \u22121) of Fig. 1 and the only possible value of\nthe mean velocity of the particles is 2. Thus, < Ve > remains constant equal to 2 and the\n\ndynamics is essentially the same as in the perfect lattice case.\n\n2) Intermediate disorder region, 0.08 < \u03b1 < \u03b2K = 0.136 (see the case \u03b1 = 0.12 in Fig.\ne1 is\n5 and Fig. 6c, where this region is enlarged). In this region, the first cummulant C\ne2 \u223c e\nproportional to e\nt, but now C\nt, indicating the existence of normal diffusion. The slope\nof the packet mean velocity changes abruptly for each value of \u03b1, where a new mode is\nreached, as seen in Fig. 1. At \u03b1 > 0.08 the region labeled (+3, \u22120) is reached and the mean\n11\n\n\fvelocity may have one of the two values +2 or +3. Consequently Ve increases with \u03b1, as can\nbe seen in Fig. 6a. At \u03b1 = 0.1 region (+4, \u22121) is also available and the mean velocity can\nhave any of the values +2, +3 and +4. Then Ve continues increasing with \u03b1, with a higher\n\nslope. Fig. 6c shows an enlarged view of a region of Fig. 6b, where the normal diffusion can\nbe observed. As can be seen, for \u03b1 < 0.08 transport is not diffusive. At \u03b1 = 0.08 normal\ndiffusion starts and as \u03b1 is increased further, diffusion is enhanced and the same critical\nvalue of \u03b1 appear as in the case of Ve (Fig.6a).\n\n3) The region \u03b1 \u2243 \u03b2K = 0.136 (see, for example, the case \u03b1 = 0.145 in Fig.5). In this\n\nregion the trapping mechanism has already started. The cumulants C1 and C2 increase as\ne\ntH with H > 1, indicating a super-diffusive behavior. The time-dependence of the second\n\nmoment is very complicated during the trapping process and it strongly depends on both\nthe quenched disorder realization and the strength of the disorder. This transitory time\n\nis considerably reduced as \u03b1 increases beyond the threshold. The trapping mechanism\nproduces an abrupt descent in Ve . The other values \u03b2K\u22121 = \u03b22 and \u03b2K\u22122 = \u03b21 do not appear\n\nin Figs.6 because the probability that a particle gets trapped in a K = 3 valley length trap\napproaches 1 for a disorder region with L = 50 >> K = 3, and most particles get trapped\n\nin K = 3 length valleys, regardless of whether K \u2212 1 = 2 and K \u2212 2 = 1 length traps exist\ne\nor not. In Fig. 6b the super diffusive region is clearly recognized by the high values in D.\ne is much smaller than in the super\nBelow the threshold value \u03b2K diffusion is normal and D\n\nf2 varies with time in a very complicated way as long as there\ndiffusive region. Note that C\nexist both, trapped and untrapped particles. Untrapped particles suffer a normal diffusion\n\nprocess but trapped particles cause the packet to get wider as it evolves, increasing D. In\nfact, for t \u2192 \u221e (and consequently L \u2192 \u221e) all particles get finally trapped and D \u2192 0 .\n4) The region \u03b1 \u226b \u03b2K (see the case \u03b1 = 0.165 in Fig.5). In this region, complete trapping\ne decrease to zero. The system\noccurs even for small disordered zones and both < Ve > and D\n\nundergoes a transition at \u03b1 = \u03b2K between two different transport regimes: for \u03b1 < \u03b2K there\nis normal diffusive transport while for \u03b1 >> \u03b2K both transport and diffusion disappear. In\nthe neighborhood of \u03b1 = \u03b2K anomalous diffusion is present. The anomalous transport found\nrecently in an overdamped tilted potential model with thermal noise but without quenched\ndisorder and driving force [19], a similar transition between normal diffusive transport is\ngiven by the variation of the tilting force F and anomalous diffusion appears near the\ncritical value Fc .\n12\n\n\fThe anomalous transport effect of trapping is robust under thermal fluctuations in the\nsense that thermal fluctuation amplitudes of the order of the quenched disorder strength are\nrequired to destroy this effect.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nA novel trapping mechanism is discovered which is proposed as the origin of the anomalous transport in a multi-particle overdamped disordered ratchet. It is found that once a\nparticle reaches a trap it remains localized inside a small region, oscillating synchronously\nwith the external force. By means of the disorder configuration space, critical values for the\ndisorder strengths were determined and the fraction of particles traversing a disordered region were obtained by means of two methods. In the first method, valid for low disorder, the\neffects of correlations between the contiguous traps were neglected. In the second approach,\nwhich is valid for disorder strengths over all the critical values, correlations were considered.\nThe probability density function shows excellent agreement with the simulation data. The\ntrapping mechanism presented here explains the singular behavior of velocity and diffusion\nwith disorder in overdamped ratchets reported in [16]. This analysis may be helpful in the\nstudy of other systems exhibiting strange kinetics and also for practical applications such\nas the design of particle separation techniques in multi-particle systems.\n\nVII.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was partially supported by CONICET (PIP 5569), Universidad Nacional de\nMar del Plata and ANPCyT (PICT 11-21409 and PICTO 11-495).\n\nVIII.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\n[1] S.
