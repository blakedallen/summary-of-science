It is expected that new physics should exist at\nsome high energy scale \u039b to smear the divergent mass of Higgs, induced from one-loop level.\nOtherwise, the principle of naturalness [2] is breakdown while \u039b goes to the scale which is\nmuch higher than that of electroweak. It is found that extending the SM to supersymmetry\n(SUSY) at the scale \u039b of O(TeV) can solve not only the hierarchy problem, but also the\nproblem of unified gauge coupling [3, 4]. Furthermore, the predicted lightest neutralino in\nsupersymmetric models could also provide the candidate of dark matter [3, 5].\nApart from the above successes, models with SUSY still suffer some difficulties from\nphenomenological reasons, such as the problems on small CP violating phases, large flavor\nmixings and proton decays, as well as they predict too large cosmological constant. Inevitably, fine tuning always appears in the low energy physics. Recently, in order to explain\nthe cosmological constant problem and preserve the beauty of the ordinary low-energy SUSY\nmodels, the scenario of split SUSY is suggested [6, 7], in which the SUSY breaking scale is\nmuch higher than the electroweak scale. In this split SUSY scenario, except the SM Higgs\nwhich could be as light as the current experimental limit, the scalar particles are all ultraheavy. On the other hand, by the protection of approximate chiral symmetries, the masses\nof fermions, such as gauginos and higgsinos, could be at the electroweak scale [6, 8].\nBased on the aspect of split SUSY, various interesting topics on particle physics phenomenology have been studied, including, for instance, physics at colliders [9], Higgs [10],\nphenomena of stable gluino [11], sparticles in cosmic rays [12], dark matter [13, 14], grand\nunified theories (GUTs) [15], neutrino physics [16], and so on.\nIn this paper, we examine the implication of the split SUSY scenario on B physics at\nhadron colliders, such as BTeV and LHC. In particular, we explore the possibility of having\nlarge effects in the dilepton decays and oscillation in the Bs system with split SUSY. In the\nconventional SUSY models with R-parity invariance, it is known that the gaugino penguin\nand box diagrams have significant contributions to B processes, such as Bd(s) \u2212 B\u0304d(s) mixings,\n\nB \u2192 Xs \u03b3 [17], B \u2192 K \u2217 l+ l\u2212 [18], and the time-dependent CP asymmetry of B \u2192 \u03c6KS [19]\netc. However, since the diagrams involved are associated with squarks in the internal loop,\nthe results in the split SUSY will be highly suppressed by the masses of squarks, denoted\nby mS . Hence, one suspects that the scenario of split SUSY with R-parity could not induce\ninteresting phenomena from low energy physics.\n2\n\n\fIn this study, we consider split SUSY in the framework of R-parity violation. It has\nbeen pointed out recently in Ref. [13] that the lightest neutralino in the R-parity violating\nmodel could still remain the candidate of dark matter. Although R-parity violation leads to\nthe decay of neutralino, by the suppression of the high-scale SUSY breaking, the neutralino\nlifetime could exceed the age of our universe. Moreover, by the combination of bilinear\nand trilinear couplings, it has been shown in Ref. [16] that the observed mass scales of\natmospheric and solar neutrinos can be accommodated in the split SUSY scenario without\nR-parity. In our analyses, we will assume that the neutrino mixing arises from the neutralinoneutrino mixing in our split SUSY scenario. However, it should be clear that one does not\nneed SUSY to explain neutrino masses or mixings, which can be understood quite well in\nthe context of the standard model, with appropriate assumptions on neutrino mass matrix.\nBased on the results in Refs. [13, 16], we find that if the induced mixing of sneutrino and\nHiggs is not constrained by the neutrino masses, the decay BR of Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 can reach the\ncurrent experimental upper limit, whereas the effect of the Bs \u2212 B\u0304s oscillation can be two\norders larger than that in the SM.\nWe start by introducing the interactions of R-parity violating terms. In terms of the\nnotations in Ref. [16] , the bilinear and trilinear terms for the lepton number violation in\nthe superpotential can be written as [16, 20, 21]\nW = \u03bcH1 H2 + \u01ebi \u03bcLi H2 + \u03bb\u2032ijk Li Qj Dkc + \u03bbijk Li Lj Ekc ,\n\n(1)\n\nand the relevant scalar potential is given by\nV = BH1 H2 + Bi Li H2 + m2Li H1 Li H1\u2020 + h.c. .\n\n(2)\n\nNote that, for simplicity, we have neglected the baryon number violating effects and used the\nsame notations for superfields and ordinary fields. In split SUSY, the soft parameters B, Bi\nand m2Li H1 could be the order of m2S . It is known that mS is in the range of 109 \u2212 1013 GeV\n[6, 7, 8]. From Eqs. (1) and (2), the bilinear R-parity violating terms can make the vacuum\nexpectation values (VEVs) of sneutrino fields be nonzero [22]. In terms of a set of tadpole\nequations [23] which are the conditions for obtaining the stable potential, these VEVs are\ngiven by \u1e7di = hH20iBi + hH10 im2Li H1 /m2Li , where we have neglected the small contributions\nof D terms for simplicity. Clearly, if Bi and m2Li H1 are the same order of magnitude or smaller\n\nthan the masses of sleptons, the VEVs are still satisfied with the conditions of minimum\n3\n\n\fpotential. By the couplings of slepton-lepton-gaugino, neutrinos and charged leptons will\nmix with neutralinos and charginos. Consequently, they induce neutrino masses at tree and\nloop levels, respectively. It has been shown [16] that to explain the atmospheric neutrino\np\nmass scale \u2206m2atom \u223c 0.05 eV, the involving parameters, associated with bilinear couplings\n\nand defined by \u03bei = \u1e7di /hH10 i \u2212 \u01ebi = m2Li H1 /m2Li + Bi /m2Li tan \u03b2 \u2212 \u01ebi with tan \u03b2 = hH20i/hH10 i,\nare limited to 10\u22126 / cos \u03b2 at tree level. That is, a strong cancelation occurs among R-parity\n\nviolating parameters in \u03bei . Since the fine-tuning problem has been abandoned in split SUSY,\neach term in \u03be could be order of unity. In order to obtain the mass scale of solar neutrino,\np\n\u2206m2sol \u223c 9 meV, one has to go to one-loop level, induced by the same bilinear couplings.\n\nHowever, the results are suppressed by \u03b7i m2Z /m2Li with \u03b7i = \u03bei \u2212 Bi /B [16, 20]. To solve\n\nthe solar neutrino mass problem, it is concluded [16] that the trilinear R-parity violating\ncouplings \u03bb\u2032i23 and \u03bb\u2032i32 need to be of order one.\nIn the following discussions, we will take that \u03bb\u2032i23,i32 as well as the ratios of the bilinear couplings and m2S , i.e., m2Li H1 /m2S and Bi /m2S , are order of unity. It is interesting to\ninvestigate if there are some observable physics phenomena beside those discussed in Ref.\n[16]. Since \u03bb\u2032i23,i32 \u223c 1, it is natural for us to think of physics involving the flavor changing\n\nnatural current (FCNC) of b \u2192 s transition. Indeed, we find that Bs \u2192 l+ l\u2212 can occur\n\nat tree level as shown in Fig. 1, which may not be suppressed. In the SM, it is known\n\nbR(L)\n\nl\u2212\n\u03bd\u0303Li\n\n\u00d7\n\nsL(R)\n\nH10\n\nl\u2212\n\nFIG. 1: Tree contribution to Bs \u2192 l+ l\u2212 with the cross representing the mixings between sleptons\nand Higgs.\n\nthat Bs \u2192 l+ l\u2212 decays arise from the electroweak penguin and box diagrams. The decay\nbranching ratio (BR) of Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 is found to be (3.8 \u00b1 1.0) \u00d7 10\u22129 [24] which is much\n\nless than the current experimental upper limit of 5.0 \u00d7 10\u22127 [25]. From the relationship\n\nB(Bs \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 )/B(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) = m\u03042\u03c4 /m\u03042\u03bc with m\u0304l = ml (1 \u2212 4m2l /m2Bs )1/2 [26], the corresponding tau mode can be also studied. It was demonstrated that B(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) = O(10\u22127)\n4\n\n\fcould be achieved in ordinary SUSY models [27]. However, it is easy to check that these\ncontributions are suppressed in the split SUSY scenario. Since in the split SUSY approach,\nexcept the SM-like Higgs denoted by h0 is light, all scalars are extremely heavy. Therefore, we may simplify the calculations by using \u2212h0 sin \u03b1 (h0 cos \u03b1) instead of the Higgs\nH10 (H20 ), where the angle \u03b1 describes the mixing of two neutral Higgses [28]. In terms of the\ninteractions in Eqs. (1) and (2), the decay amplitude for Bs \u2192 l+ l\u2212 is given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2032\nfBs m2Bs m2Li H1 (\u03bb\u2032\u2217\n\u2212i\ngml sin \u03b1\ni23 \u2212 \u03bbi32 )\n+ \u2212\nA = hl l |Hef f |B\u0304s i =\nl\u0304 l\n2m2h 2mW cos \u03b2 (mb + ms )\nm2\u03bd\u0303i\n\n(3)\n\nwhere mh , mW , mb , ms , ml , mBs stand for the masses of Higgs, W-boson, b-quark, s-quark,\nlepton and Bs , respectively. As mentioned early, except the SM-like Higgs, the masses\nof sfermions, scalar and pseudoscalar bosons are much higher than the electroweak scale.\nTherefore, the contributions from other scalar particles will be neglected. In Eq. (3), the\nsecond factor and m2Li H1 are from the coupling of the SM Higgs to the lepton and the mixings\nbetween sleptons and Higgs, respectively. In the equation, we have also used the identity\nh0|s\u0304\u03b35 b|B\u0304s i \u2248 \u2212i fBs m2Bs /(mb + ms ). Since the trilinear couplings in sleptons and quarks\n\n\u2032\ninvolve two possible chiralities, there is a cancelation in Eq. (3). Note that if \u03bb\u2032\u2217\ni23 = \u03bbi32 ,\n\nour mechanism vanishes automatically. By squaring the decay amplitude and including the\nphase space factor, the decay rate is derived to be\nmBs GF m2l\n\u221a\n\u0393 =\n16\u03c0\n2\n\n\u0012\n\nfBs mBs sin \u03b1\n|Ni |\nm2h cos \u03b2\n\n\u00132 \"\n\u0012\n\u00132 # 32\n2ml\n1\u2212\nmBs\n\n(4)\n\n\u2032\n2\n2\nwith Ni = m2Li H1 (\u03bb\u2032\u2217\ni23 \u2212 \u03bbi32 )/m\u03bd\u0303i . We note that the decay rate is proportional to ml , which\n\nis the same as that in the SM.\nBesides Bs \u2192 l+ l\u2212 decays, we find that the same mechanism can also generate other\nFCNC processes, such as the Bs \u2212 B\u0304s mixing, induced by the W-exchange box diagrams\nin the SM. We note that its SM value is (1.19 \u00b1 0.24) \u00d7 10\u221211 GeV [29], while the current\n\nexperimental limit is larger than 9.48 \u00d7 10\u221212 GeV [30]. In SUSY models with R-parity,\nthe main effects are also from the box diagrams but with gluinos and charginos instead of\nW-boson in the loops [17]. Unfortunately, the resultants are associated with 1/m2S , which\nare obviously highly suppressed in split SUSY. However, if we insert one more mixing of\nsneutrinos and Higgses in the Higgs propagator of Fig. 1, the Bs \u2212 B\u0304s oscillation could be\ninduced at tree-level too, as shown in Fig. 2. Consequently, the effective Hamiltonian is\n5\n\n\fobtained as\nHef f\n\n\u2032\n\u03bb\u2032\u2217\ni23 \u03bbj32\n=\nCij (s\u0304 PR b)(s\u0304 PL b) + h.c. ,\nm2h\n\n(5)\n\nwhere\nCij =\n\nh\ni\n1\n\u2217\n2\n2\n2\n2\nB\nB\ncos\n\u03b1\n+\nm\nm\nsin\n\u03b1\n.\ni\nj\nLi H 1 Lj H 1\nm2\u03bd\u0303i m\u03bd\u03032j\n\n(6)\n\nIt is interesting to note that if Bi = m2Li H1 , Cij will be independent of the angle \u03b1.

(5), we see that the induced oscillation is associated with the multiple of \u03bb\u2032\u2217\ni23 \u03bbj32 . By\n\nconsidering the CP conserving case, the effective couplings are similar to those for the solar\nneutrino masses, presented by [16]\nMij\u03bd \u223c\n\n3 \u2032 \u2032 mb ms\n\u03bb \u03bb\n.\n8\u03c0 2 i23 j32 mS\n\n(7)\n\nTo estimate the hadronic matrix element, we employ the results of vacuum insertion method,\ngiven by [17]\n\"\n\n1\n1\n+\nhB\u0304s |s\u0304 PR b s\u0304 PL b|Bs i \u2248\n24 4\n\n\u0012\n\nmBs\nmb + ms\n\n\u00132 #\n\nmBs fB2 s .\n\nAs a result, the mass difference for Bs and B\u0304s is described by\n\"\n\u0012\n\u00132 #\n4\nm\n1\n1\nB\ns\n\u2032\nmBs fB2 s .\n\u2206mBs = 2|M12 | = 2 Re(\u03bb\u2032\u2217\n+\ni23 \u03bbj32 Cij )\nmh\n24 4 mb + ms\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\nHence, it will be interesting to see if large contributions on BRs of Bs \u2192 l+ l\u2212 and the Bs\noscillation can be obtained in our split SUSY scenario.\nTo estimate the numerical values, we take fBs = 0.23 GeV [31], mBs = 5.37 GeV ,\nmb = 4.5 GeV, ms = 0.13 GeV, and \u03c4Bs = 1.46 \u00d7 10\u221212 s [30]. In order to preserve the\n6\n\n\fsolar neutrino mass to be \u223c 9 meV, we set \u03bb\u2032i23 = 0.9 and \u03bb\u2032j32 = \u22120.3. As one of CP-even\nHiggs bosons is very heavy, \u03b1 \u2243 \u03c0/2 + \u03b2 and sin \u03b1/ cos \u03b2 = 1. Therefore, in the split SUSY\n\nscenario, we see that the BR of Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 is independent of the angles \u03b1 and \u03b2 due to\np\ndue to Eq. (4). For simplicity, we set \u03b6 = mLi H1 /m\u03bd\u0303i = |Bi |/m\u03bd\u0303i so that in our numerical\nestimations Cij = \u03b6 4 . To illustrate the specific values for BR(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) and \u2206mBs , by\nusing Eqs. (4) and (9) and choosing mh = 150 GeV and \u03b6 = 0.18, we get\nBR(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22127 ,\n\u2206mBs = 4.8 \u00d7 10\u22129 GeV .\n\n(10)\n\nWe note that in Eq. (10) the decay BR of Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 is close to the current experimental\nlimit, while \u2206mBs is two orders of magnitude larger than the SM prediction. It is clear\nthat our results on BR(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) and \u2206mBs can be observed at hadron colliders, such\nas BTeV and LHC which produce more than 108 Bs B\u0304s . In Figs. 3 and 4, we present\n\nBR(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) and \u2206mBs as functions of \u03b6 with mh = 150 GeV and mh with \u03b6 = 0.18,\nrespectively. Since we have taken Bi = m2Li H1 , the values of \u2206mBs will not depend on angle\n\n\u03b1.\n)10\n\n8\n\n10\n\n9\n\n40\n\n30\n\nm\n\nBs\n\n+\n\n6\n\n4\n\nBR(B\n\ns\n\n20\n\n10\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n0.15\n\n0.20\n\n0.25\n\n0.30\n\n(a)\n\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n0.15\n\n0.20\n\n0.25\n\n0.30\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 3: (a) BR(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) and (b) \u2206mBs as functions of \u03b6 with mh = 150 GeV.\n\nFinally, we remark that our mechanism could also be used to the Bd processes. By\nusing \u03bb\u2032i13,j31 instead of \u03bb\u2032i23,j32 , similar phenomena will occur in Bd \u2192 l+ l\u2212 decays and the\n\noscillation of Bd . However, since md << ms , even with \u03bb\u2032i13,j31 being order of unity, there\nare no interesting contributions to the solar neutrino masses. Moreover, the Bd \u2212 B\u0304d mixing\n\ncould be used as the constraint on the corresponding trilinear couplings. In addition, it is\nworth mentioning that the tree contribution of b \u2192 sl+ l\u2212 in Fig. 1 could lead large effects\n7\n\n\f10\n\n7\n\n)10\n\n10\n\n2.5\n\nm\n\n+\n\nBs\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n6\n\n1.0\n\n4\n\n0.5\n\n2\n\ns\n\nBR(B\n\n8\n\n0\n\n0.0\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n(a)\n\nmh[GeV]\n180\n\n200\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n(b)\n\n180\n\n200\n\nmh[GeV]\n\nFIG. 4: (a) BR(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) and (b) \u2206mBs as functions of mh with \u03b6 = 0.18.\n\non physics in B \u2192 K (\u2217) l+ l\u2212 [32] and \u039bb \u2192 \u039bl+ l\u2212 [33].

The study will be presented elsewhere [34].\n\nIn summary, we have studied the implications of split SUSY on the FCNC processes due\nto the b \u2192 s transition. It has been shown that when the solar neutrino mass problem is\nsolved in split SUSY scenario, we find that the mixing effects of sneutrino and Higgs could\nhave large contributions to the BRs of Bs \u2192 l+ l\u2212 and the Bs \u2212 B\u0304s mixing.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Kingman Cheung for helpful discussions.
