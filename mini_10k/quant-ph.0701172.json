Different neutral atom quantum computing proposals [1, 2, 3] differ in trapping techniques. We focus on arrays of microscopic traps (microtraps) that can be implemented using independent focused\nlaser beams. The typical size of a microtrap in current experiments is about 2\u03bcm because of the diffraction limit of a\nlaser beam as well as experimentally technical issues. Unlike\nan optical lattice, all microtraps can be moved independently\nin position space, therefore they have advantages in single\natom addressability and controlled interactions between pairs\nof atoms. In recent years, many schemes have been proposed\nfor universal quantum computation in microtrap systems [3].\nThese schemes are based on the assumption that thousands\nof neutral atoms can be prepared in the ground states of optical\nmicrotrap arrays with one atom per trap, i.e. they assume the\nability to initialize a neutral atom quantum register. Although\nimpressive experimental progress has been made in trapping\nsingle atoms [4], such an assumption has not been fulfilled because the trapping processes are random and not deterministic. Furthermore, the trapped atoms are not in the trap ground\nstates. These difficulties have prevented neutral atom quantum\ncomputation architectures from accomplishing the kind of impressive experimental progress recently achieved in ion trap\nquantum computation [5]. To overcome these difficulties one\nproposal seeks to extract single atoms from a Bose-Einstein\ncondensate (BEC) by moving an optical dipole trap out of the\ncondensate [6].\nIn this paper, we propose two concrete schemes to quickly\nextract thousands of neutral atoms from the Mott insulator\n(MI) state in optical lattices [7] and prepare them in the ground\nstates of optical microtrap arrays with precisely one atom per\ntrap. In the MI regime, atom number fluctuations at each site\nare suppressed and a MI state may be obtained with proper experimental parameters, as demonstrated in recent experiments\n[2, 7, 8]. Indeed, a perfect MI state with one atom per lattice\nsite may be implemented through purification processes [9].\nIn MI states, atoms are isolated from each other and occupy\nthe ground states of each site making it difficult to realize a\nlow density MI in long lattice spacing (d) laser geometries\n[10] where the MI energy scales (\u223c d \u22122 ) fall below charac-\n\nteristic temperatures. On the other hand, the size of a microtrap (\u223c 2\u03bcm) is much larger than the typical lattice spacing\n(\u223c 0.4\u03bcm), which make it difficult to extract atoms to microtraps directly from a MI state. Therefore the main challenge,\nand also the goal of this paper, is to transfer single atoms from\noptical lattices with a short lattice period (SPOL) to spatially\nseparate optical microtraps.\nWe show in the first scheme that such transfer process\nmay be accomplished using hyperfine state dependent optical lattices with a long lattice period (LPOL), microwave radiation, and resonant \"removing\" lasers. A LPOL is created by intersecting two laser beams at a certain angle, as\ndemonstrated in a recent experiment [10]. The LPOL induces position-dependent energy shifts of the hyperfine states\nof atoms, which, when combined with microwave radiation\nand resonant \"removing\" lasers, expel many atoms out of the\noptical lattice and form a patterned loaded optical lattice with\none atom per n lattice sites (n \u2265 3 is an integer). The remaining atoms in the lattices are well separated, and can be\nadiabatically transferred to the ground states of optical microtrap arrays with one atom per trap. With our scheme, thousands of atoms may be extracted and the failure probability in\nextraction can be kept below \u223c 10\u22124 . In the second scheme,\nthe transfer process is accomplished using state-dependent focused lasers without expelling atoms out of the optical lattice,\ntherefore more atoms can be extracted but the failure probability is much higher. These complementary schemes, one with\nvery high fidelity (but relatively lower speed) and the other\nwith very fast speed (but relatively lower fidelity), take advantage of the robust localization inherent in the MI to isolate\natoms. The whole operational process is simple and within\ncurrently accessible experimental technology.\nThe first extraction scheme includes four operational steps\nand their time sequences are schematically plotted in Fig. 1a.\nIn the following, we explain each step and study various errors that could lead to failures in extraction. For simplicity,\nwe focus on a one dimensional geometry but we emphasize\nthat our technique can be straightforwardly applied to two dimensional arrays.\nStep (I) Initial Mott state: Consider a pure 87 Rb BEC prepared in the hyperfine ground state |0i \u2261 |F = 1, mF = \u22121i\nand confined in a quasi-one dimensional (x direction) harmonic magnetic trap. Along the transverse direction, the\n\n\f2\n\u03b4E1 = \u03b4E\u2212 , which give the total shift of the hyperfine splitting\n\u03b11\n\u03b12\nbetween |0i and |1i, \u03b4E = \u03b4E1 \u2212 \u03b4E0 = 2\u2206\n\u2212 2\u2206\n, where\n1\n2\n2\n3\n\u03b1q = 3\u03c0c \u0393q I/2\u03c9q . Following a similar procedure, we find\nthe spontaneous emission rates for atoms at |0i and |1i are\n\nDepth\n\nI\n\n(b)\n\n\u03b8\n\nz\nx\n\nIII IV Time\n\nII\n\n(c)\nV/ER\n\n(a)\n\n\u03b30 =\n\n0\n\nA\n\n-50\n-100\n0\n\nB\n\nA\nBB\n10\n\nA\nBB\n\nkx\n\n20\n\nB\n30\n\nFigure 1: (color online).

Solid and dashed lines correpsond to the optical potentials for\natoms at states |0i and |1i respectively. A labels target atoms for extraction and B labels other atoms.\n\natomic dynamics are frozen out by high frequency optical\ntraps [11]. An optical lattice along the x direction with wavelength \u03bb s = 850nm is ramped up adiabatically (\u223c 200ms) to\na large potential depth of V s = 50ER such that the BEC is\nconverted into a MI state with roughly one atom per lattice\nsite, using properly chosen trapping parameters and number of\natoms [7]. Here ER = h2 /2m\u03bb2s denotes the recoil energy. This\nMI state may have defects [8] and clever purification schemes\n[9] may yield a nearly perfect MI state with exact one atom\nper lattice site. Such a perfect MI state is the reservoir for\nsingle atom extraction and provides the starting point of our\nscheme.\nStep (II) Selective Depopulation: Here atoms at specific,\nunwanted sites are transferred to another hyperfine state. Two\n\u03c3+ -polarized laser beams intersecting at an angle \u03b8 (Fig.1b),\nwhich drive the 5S \u2192 5P transition and has a detuning\n\u22062 = \u22122\u03c0 \u00d7 3608GHz to the 52 P3/2 state (corresponding to\na wavelength \u03bbl = 787.6nm), are adiabatically ramped up.\nThese two beams form a LPOL along the x direction with the\nlattice period \u03b7l = \u03bbl / [2 sin (\u03b8/2)]. Here we require \u03b7l to be n\ntimes that of the short wavelength optical lattice period \u03bb s /2,\nthat is, \u03b8 = 2 arcsin [\u03bbl /n\u03bb s ]. The LPOL induces energy shifts\n2\n3\u03c0c2 I (r) X \u0393q c\u00b1q\n\u03b4E\u00b1 (r) =\n2\n\u03c93q \u2206q\nq=1,2\n\n(1)\n\nfor two finestructure\nground states\n|\u00b1i\n=\nE\n5S : j = 1/2, m j = \u00b11/2 , where I (r) is the intensity of\nthe laser, \u0393q (q = 1, 2) is the decay rate for states 52 P1/2\nand 52 P3/2 . \u03c9q (\u2206q ) is the frequency (detuning) for the\n2\ntransition\u221afrom 5S to 5\u221a\nP1/2 and 52 P3/2 . c+1 = 0, c+2 = 1,\nc\u22121 = \u2212 2/3, c\u22122 = 1/3 are transition coefficients. Two\nhyperfine states |0i and |1i \u2261 |F = 2, m = \u22122i can be written\nas |0i = 1/4 |\u2212i + 3/4 |+i, |1i = |\u2212i using the respective\nClebsch-Gordan coefficients. Therefore the energy shifts\nfor states |0i and |1i are \u03b4E0 = \u03b4E\u2212 /4 + 3\u03b4E+ /4, and\n\n2\u03b11 \u03931 \u03b12 \u03932\n\u03b11 \u03931 5\u03b12 \u03932\n+\n, \u03b31 =\n+\n.\n2\n2\n6\u22061\n6\u22062\n3\u220621\n3\u220622\n\n(2)\n\nNotice that the wavelength \u03bbl = 787.6nm (i.e. the detuning\n\u22062 = \u22122\u03c0\u00d73608GHz) is optimized to obtain the maximal ratio\n\u03b7 = \u03b4E/\u03b3 between the shift \u03b4E and the rate \u03b3 = max {\u03b30 , \u03b31 }.\nThe energy shifts induced by the LPOL are spatially dependent for atoms confined in the SPOL. In Fig. 1c, we plot the\ncombined lattice potentials for atoms at |0i and |1i with n = 3.\nWe see that the LPOL induces two different shifts of the hyperfine splitting, depending on the positions of atoms (A or\nB), and the difference \u03b4 = \u03b4E (A) \u2212 \u03b4E (B) can be adjusted\nand chosen to be \u03b4 = 52ER . Applying the adiabatic condition,\nwe estimate the ramp up time to be 44\u03bcs that corresponds to a\n10\u22124 probability for excitation to higher bands.\nWe then apply a microwave \u03c0 pulse to flip the quantum\nstates of atoms at position B (Fig. 1c) from |0i to |1i. The\nmicrowave is resonant with the hyperfine splitting of atoms at\nB, but has a detuning \u03b4 for atoms at A. A time-dependent\nmi\u0010\n\u0011\ncrowave pulse with frequency \u03a9 (t) = \u03a90 exp \u2212\u03c920 t2 (\u2212t f \u2264\nt \u2264 t f ) is used to perform the \u03c0 pulse. For a set of microwave parameters\n\u03c90 = \u03b4/4\n= 13ER /~, t f = 5/\u03c90 , and\n\u0014R\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u0015\ntf\n2 2\n\u03a90 = \u03c0/ \u2212t exp \u2212\u03c90 t dt \u2248 23ER /~, the pulse flips the\nf\nquantum state of atom B from |0i to |1i in 2t f = 38.6\u03bcs, while\nthe error to flip atom A to state |1i is found to be 5.9 \u00d7 10\u22126 by\nnumerically integrating the Rabi equation [12] that describes\nthe coupling between |0i and |1i through the microwave pulse.\nThe LPOL are adiabatically turned off after the microwave\npulse. During the whole process time \u03c4, the probability for\nspontaneous scattering\nof one photon from each atom is estiR\u03c4\nmated to be P = 0 \u03b3dt \u2248 1 \u00d7 10\u22124 .\nStep (III) Remove Non-target Atoms: In this step, atoms at\nB are removed from the trap by applying a \u03c3\u2212 -polarized \"removing\" laser that drives a resonant\ncycling transition |1i \u2192\nE\n|2i \u2261 52 P3/2 : F = 3, mF = \u22123 . Scattering photons from the\nlaser push (or heat) non-target atoms B at |1i out of the trap\nwithout affecting target atoms A at state |0i because of the\nlarge hyperfine splitting (\u03bd \u2248 2\u03c0 \u00d7 6.8GHz) between the two\nstates. To push (or heat) atoms out of a trap with depth U0 ,\nthe number of spontaneous emission photons needs to be at\nleast n p = U0 /2ER [4]. For instance, 25 photons are needed\nfor each non-target atom to remove it from an optical lattice\nwith depth U0 = 50ER . The dynamics of the photon scattering process are described by the optical Bloch equation [12],\nfrom which we can numerically calculate the number of scattering photons n p for both target and non-target atoms. We\nfind the number of scattering photons can reach 25 in a short\nperiod \u223c 1\u03bcs for atoms B, but it is only \u223c 10\u22125 for atoms\nA. Therefore the impact of the resonant laser on the target\natoms A can be neglected. Note that hot non-target atoms\ntunnel more easily in the optical lattice, which enhances the\ncollision probability between target and non-target atoms at\n\n\f3\n\n\u2202\u031f\n\nE\nwhere \u03c6g , and |\u03c6e i are the ground and the excited state wavefunction, \u2206Eg is the energy gap between two states, and \u03be is\nthe adiabaticity parameter. Because of the parity of the wavefunctions, the lowest possible excitation is to the second\nexE\n\u221a\n\u2202H\ncited state, which gives \u2206Eg = 2~\u031f, and h\u03c6e | \u2202\u031f\n\u03c6g = ~/ 2.\nThe adiabatic condition, Eq. (3), yields\na\u221atime-dependent\ntrap\u0011\n\u0010\nping frequency \u031f (t) = \u031f (0) / 1 \u2213 4 2\u03be\u031f (0) t , where \u2213\ncorrespond to a deeper and shallower final trapping frequency\nrespectively.\nUnder the adiabatic approximation, the quantum states of\nthe target atoms can be expanded using the time-dependent\nbasis \u03c6 (t) = cg (t) \u03c6g (\u031f (t))+ce (t) \u03c6e (\u031f (t)), where \u03c6g (\u031f (t)),\nand \u03c6e (\u031f (t)) are the adiabatic ground and second excited states of the Hamiltonian H (\u031f (t)) with the associated\neigenenergies Eg = ~\u031f (t) /2 and Ee = 5~\u031f (t) /2. Inserting\nthis expansion into the the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for a single\ntarget atom A yields a coupled equation for the coefficients\ncg (t) and ce (t):\n!\n!\n!\nd cg\ncg\nEg \u03ba (t)\ni~\n,\n(4)\n=\n\u2212\u03ba (t) Ee\nce\ndt ce\n\u2202H\nh\u03c6e | \u2202\u031f\n| \u03c6g i\n= i\u03be\u2206Eg . This equation can\nwhere \u03ba (t) = \u2212i~ d\u031f(t)\ndt\n\u2206Eg\nbe solved analytically to give the occupation probability at the\n\n(b)\n\n(a) 30\n\n1\u00d710 \u22124\n\nPe(t )\n\n\u03c0 (t ) / \u03c0 (0 )\n\ndifferent lattice sites. However, because of the high lattice\ndepths (\u223c 50ER ), the tunneling rate is quite low (\u223c 0.01ER )\non average for hot non-target atoms, which yields a long tunneling time (\u223c 100ms). The short lifetime (\u223c 1\u03bcs) of hot\nnon-target atoms makes the collision probability very small\n(\u223c 1\u03bcs/100ms = 10\u22125 ). The effect of interatomic collisions\non the target atoms can therefore be neglected.\nStep (IV) Transfer to Microtraps: In this last step, the remaining target atoms A at the optical lattice sites are adiabatically distributed to the ground state of optical microtrap\narrays with one atom per trap. The optical microtraps may\nbe focused far red-detuned lasers or high frequency bluedetuned optical traps using Hermite-Gaussian TEM01 mode\nbeams [11]. Each optical microtrap is focused near one target atom and contains only one atom because of the large\nspacing between atoms in the lattice. In the distribution process, the effective potentials the target atoms experience may\nbe approximated as\nthe trapping freq\u0010harmonic potentials with\n\u0011\n2\n2\n4V f (t) /w + 2VL (t) k /m, where V f (t)\nquency \u031f (t) =\nand VL (t) are the potential depths of the microtraps and the\noptical lattice respectively, w is the beam waist of the microtrap lasers. V f (t) and VL (t) may be varied simultaneously to\n\u221a\nadjust \u031f (t) from its initial value \u031f (0) = (2ER /~) VL (0) /ER\nto the final expected \u031f (t0 ). If \u031f (t0 ) = \u031f (0), the final microtrap potential depth V f (t0 ) = VL (0) k2 w2 /2 \u2248 1366ER\n(\u223c 104\u03bcK) for initial parameters V s (0) = 50ER , and w = 1\u03bcm.\nWhen a deeper or shallower microtrap potential depth is\nneeded, the trapping frequency \u031f (t) should be adjusted so\nthat the adiabatic condition is satisfied\n\u00112\n\u0010\n\u2206Eg\nd\u031f (t)\n(3)\n=\u03be\n~\nE,\ndt\nh\u03c6e | \u2202H \u03c6g\n\n20\n10\n0\n0\n\n5 \u00d710 \u22125\n10\n\n20\n\n\u03c0 (0 )t\n\n30\n\n0\n\n15\n\n\u03c0 (0 )t\n\n30\n\nFigure 2: The adiabatic process for the distribution of the target\natoms from the optical lattice to arrays of optical dipole microtraps with higher trapping frequencies.

We see Pe (t) oscillates with time, but has the maximum 4\u03be2 . For adiabaticity parameter \u03be = 0.005, the maximal excitation probability is 10\u221a\u22124 . The total distribution time\nis T = (1 \u2212 \u031f (0) /\u031f (T )) /(4 2\u03be\u031f (0)). For instance, T \u2248\n94\u03bcs is needed to transfer target atoms from the optical lattice\nto microtraps with trapping frequency \u031f (T ) = 4\u031f (0) (corresponding to a 1.66 mK trap potential) with 10\u22124 excitation\nprobability. We note that this transfer time is much shorter\nthan the characteristic hopping time (\u223c 5s for V s = 50ER ) of\natoms within the depleted optical lattice.\nCombining all four operational steps, we find that thousands of atoms can be extracted from the optical lattice to microtraps in less than 300\u03bcs. For instance, in a one dimensional\noptical lattice with 300 usable atoms for single atom extraction, we can extract 100 atoms (one per three lattice sites). In\na two dimensional trap, the same process can extract 1/9 of\ntotal atoms (\u223c 104 ) simultaneously, which offers a large scale\nup in the initialization stage of a quantum computation using\nmicrotrap arrays.\nThe failure probability of extraction does not decrease with\nan increasing n. That is because the microtrap potential is already very weak at a \u223c 1.3\u03bcm displacement (the position of\nthe neighboring atoms in a n = 3 superlattice) from the trap\ncenter for a typical \u223c 2\u03bcm microtrap. The potential has a negligible effect on the process of transferring neighboring atoms\nto other microtraps. A large n lattice does not contribute to the\nlargest error source of the scheme: the heating due to spontaneously scattered photons from atoms in the state-dependent\nlattice in step (II).\nA Speedup Scheme: In the above scheme, the qubit supply time for quantum computation is limited by the period\nfor preparing Bose-Einstein condensates, which is typically\non the order of minutes. Notice that in step (III) most atoms\n(2/3 in 1D or 8/9 in 2D lattices) are lost from the lattice by\napplying the resonant \"removing\" laser. In the following, we\npropose a scheme for single atom extraction without remov-\n\n\f4\n\n(b) 0\n\nInitialization y\n\nx\nd\n\n-200\n\nV(y)\n\nCooling Bath\n\n(a)\n\n-400\n\nymin\n0\n\nymin\ny\n\n1\n\nymin\n2\n\nFigure 3: (color online) (a) Schematic plot for the single atom extraction from paralell one dimensional lattices.

In this scheme, 87% of the atoms can\nbe extracted within several superfluid-insulator transition cycles (\u223c 1s), considerably speeding up the rate for supplying\nfresh qubits for a neutral atom quantum computer. However,\nthe scheme induces much larger spontaneous emission probability of photons and excitation probability to high motional\nstates for atoms, which significantly degrades the fidelity of\nthe initial qubit, therefore further cooling is needed to obtain\nqubits with high fidelity.\nA schematic for the speed up scheme is plotted in Fig. 3a.\nConsider a series of parallel well separated (d = 5\u03bcm) 1D\noptical lattices (along the x direction) in the xy plane. In the\nspeedup scheme, steps (I)-(II) are still preformed to place all\ntarget atoms for extraction into state |0i and non-target atoms\nto |1i. We then ramp up a focused laser with the detuning\n\u22060 = \u22122\u03c0 \u00d7 780GHz from the 5S \u2192 62 P3/2 transition so\nthat the focused lasers only induce red-detuned traps for target atoms at state |0i, but do not affect non-target atoms at\nstate |1i [13]. The focused lasers adiabatically move along y\ndirection to take target atoms out of the optical lattices, without affecting non-target atoms at state |1i (Fig.3a). The atoms\ninside the focused lasers are then adiabatically transferred to\nfar-detuned dipole traps to suppress spontaneous emission of\nphotons. These dipole traps are moved along the x direction\nto a cooling bath to improve the fidelity of the initial qubits.\nAt the same time, the Mott insulator states in the optical lattices are melted by adiabatically ramping down the depth of\nthe optical lattice. The trap parameters are adjusted so that another Mott state with one atom per lattice site can be obtained\nas the lattice depths are adiabatically ramped up. Repeating\nthe above steps, we can extract another 1/3 of the remaining\natoms. After 5 such cycles, about 1 \u2212 (2/3)5 \u2248 87% atoms\ncan be extracted. Finally, the remaining atoms inside the optical lattices are discarded and a new BEC must be produced to\ncontinue the process.\nTo extract the atoms adiabatically from optical lattices\navoiding excitations to higher bands of the focused laser traps,\nhigh potential depths are needed, which leads to high spontaneous photon scattering probabilities. Therefore a good strat-\n\negy balances these two sources for the degradation of initial\nqubit fidelity. Assume that the optical potentials along the y\ndirection for target atoms are\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(6)\nV (y) = \u2212Vc exp \u22122y2 /\u03c32c\n\u0010\n\u0011\n2\n2\n\u2212V f exp \u22122 (y \u2212 a (t)) /\u03c3 f ,\nwhere Vc and V f are the potential depths for the 1D confinement and the focused laser, respectively. Gaussian beam\napproximations with waists \u03c3c and \u03c3 f have been used for a\nrough estimate. a (t) is the position of the focused laser center and its rate of change should satisfy the\nE adiabatic condition ~ |da (t) /dt| = \u03be\u0304\u2206Eg2 / h\u03c6e | \u2202H/\u2202a \u03c6g , where the enE\nergy gap \u2206Eg and transition matrix element h\u03c6e | \u2202H/\u2202a \u03c6g\ncan be evaluated for different potentials V (a (t)) by solving the single particle Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The potential minimum position ymin for the target atom is determined through \u2202V/\u2202y = 0. The wavefunction of the target atom is expanded\nin a harmonic\noscillator\n\u0011 \u0010\u221a\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u221a basis \u03a8n (y) =\n2\n1/4\n(\u03ba/\u03c0) exp \u2212\u03ba (y \u2212 ymin ) /2 Hn \u03bay / 2n n! around the\npotential\n\u0011 oscillation frequency \u03ba =\n\u0010\n\u0011minimum ymin , where\n\u0010 \u221a the\n\u22022 V/\u2202y2\n/m and Hn \u03bay is the Hermite polynomial.\ny min\nThe Hamiltonian for the target atoms evaluated in this basis\nfor different a (t) gives the matrix representation Hnm (a (t)) =\nh\u03a8n | H |\u03a8m i (n, m \u2264 10 is enough for our calculation). Diagonalization of the matrix yields the eigenenergies and\nE eigenfunctions, which determine \u2206Eg and h\u03c6e | \u2202H/\u2202a \u03c6g for different a (t). The total moving time can be estimated using\nZ af\nE\n~ h\u03c6e | \u2202H/\u2202a \u03c6g /\u03be\u0304\u2206Eg2 da\nT=\n(7)\n0\n\nwhere a f is the final position of the focused laser.\nIn Fig.3b, we plot the optical potential V (y) for a set of\nparameters \u03c3c \u2248 0.93\u03bcm, \u03c3 f \u2248 0.46\u03bcm, Vc = 200~2/m\u03c32c ,\nV f = 280~2 /m\u03c32c and three different a (t). Applying the above\nprocedure with these parameters, we estimate the extraction\ntime \u223c 5ms and the excitation probability to high bands \u223c\n7 \u00d7 10\u22123 , with the spontaneous scattering probability \u223c 10\u22122 .\nWe see that the fidelity of the atoms is not as high as that for\nthe original scheme. Therefore further cooling is needed to\nsignificantly improve the fidelity of initial qubits.\nConclusion: We propose two schemes for extracting thousands of atoms simultaneously from the Mott insulator state\nin optical lattices to optical microtrap arrays with one atom\nper trap. The extracted atoms stay at the ground states of the\nmicrotraps. In the first scheme, about 11% of atoms from\na BEC can be extracted and the failure probability is \u223c 10\u22124\nwith properly chosen experimental parameters. In the speedup\nscheme, about 87% of atoms from a BEC can be extracted, but\nthe failure probability is much higher \u223c 10\u22122 . We provide a\ndetailed quantitative analysis validating the feasibility of our\nproposed schemes for neutral atom quantum computation.\nWe thank S.L. Rolston for valuable discussion.
