Galaxy: Bulge - Globular Clusters: NGC 6528 - Stars: Abundances, Atmospheres\n\n1. Introduction\nThe globular cluster NGC 6528 is located in Baade's\nWindow, at (J2000) \u03b1 = 18h 04m 51.5s , \u03b4 = \u221230o 03\u2032 04\u2032\u2032\n(l=1.1459\u25e6, b=\u22124.1717\u25e6), at a distance d\u2299 = 7.8 kpc\nfrom the Sun and RGC = 0.6 kpc from the Galactic center\n(Barbuy et al. 1998).\nOrtolani et al. (1992) first presented BVRI CCD\nColour-Magnitude Diagrams (CMD) of NGC 6528.\nOrtolani et al. (1995) showed that NGC 6528, together\nwith its \"twin\" NGC 6553, has a Colour Magnitude\nSend offprint requests to: M. Zoccali\n\u22c6\nObservations collected both at the European Southern\nObservatory, Paranal and La Silla, Chile (ESO programme\n65.L-0340) and with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope,\nobtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, operated by\nAURA Inc. under contract to NASA.\n\nDiagram (CMD) and a luminosity function very similar to\nthat of the Galactic bulge, as seen in the Baade's Window\nfield. This is a clear indication that the two populations\nhave comparable age and metallicity.\nFor this reason, the two bulge globular clusters (GCs)\nNGC 6528 and NGC 6553 have often been used as templates for the old, metal-rich population of the Milky Way\ncentral spheroid (e.g. Zoccali et al. 2003).\nDespite its key importance for the interpretation of\nthe formation of our own Galaxy and, by extension, of\nexternal spheroids, the absolute value of the Fe and \u03b1element abundance, for both NGC 6528 and NGC 6553\nstill are a matter of debate. The main reasons for this\nare: i) the intrinsic difficulty to observe these faint stars;\nii) the ambiguous location of the continuum, due to the\nsevere line crowding in these metal-rich objects, iii) the\npresence of strong molecular (mainly TiO) bands in the\n\n\f2\n\nM. Zoccali et al.: Metal content of NGC 6528\n\nbrightest, coolest stars, together with effects of \u03b1-element\nenhancements on the continuum absorption; iv) the uncertainty of the effective temperature scale for stars as\nhot as the Horizontal Branch (HB): temperatures derived\nby imposing excitation equilibrium for the Fe I lines tend\nto be overestimated probably due to blends, and possibly\nto NLTE effects on Fe I in giants, whereas temperatures\nderived from colours show uncertainties due to reddening\nvariations.\nA few stars in each of the two GCs have been observed in the past few years at high spectral resolution,\nbut derived metallicities show discrepancies, higher than\nthe estimated uncertainty, thus revealing that there are\nsystematic errors not properly taken into account.\nIn NGC 6553, two were observed with CASPEC, at\nthe ESO 3.6m Telescope, by Barbuy et al. (1999). They\nderived [Fe/H]=\u22120.55, [Na/Fe]\u2248[Al/Fe]\u2248[Ti/Fe]\u2248+0.5,\n[Mg/Fe]\u2248[Si/Fe]\u2248[Ca/Fe]\u2248+0.3 and [s-elements/Fe]<\n\u223c0.0.\nA significantly higher metallicity was obtained instead by\nCohen et al. (1999), from HIRES@Keck I observations of\n5 HB stars: [Fe/H]=\u22120.16, [\u03b1/Fe]\u2248+0.2. More recently,\nOriglia et al. (2002) measured the metallicity of NGC 6553\nfrom near-IR spectra obtained with NIRSPEC@Keck II,\nobtaining [Fe/H]=\u22120.3, with [\u03b1/Fe]=+0.3. Mel\u00e9ndez et\nal. (2003) used PHOENIX@Gemini-South to obtain spectra of R = 50 000 in the H band, and they derived [Fe/H]\n= -0.20 and [O/Fe] = +0.20. A summary of the previous\nmetallicity determinations of NGC 6553 is given in Table 5\nof Barbuy et al. (1999).\nFor NGC 6528 the only high-resolution analysis published so far has been that of Carretta et al. (2001; hereafter C01), who observed four HB stars, with HIRES at\nKeck I. They obtained [Fe/H]=+0.07 and [M/H] = +0.17.\nRecently, Momany et al. (2003) determined the metallicity of NGC 6528 from RGB morphology indicators, in a\n(K,V \u2212 K) CMD, obtaining values in the range -0.43 <\n[Fe/H] < 0.13 depending on the adopted calibration.\nIn this work we present detailed abundance analysis of\nthree stars in NGC 6528 using high resolution \u00e9chelle spectra obtained with UVES at the ESO VLT-UT2 Kueyen\n8m telescope, in an attempt to reduce the discrepancy\nbetween previous measurements using higher spectral resolution (R\u223c50 000) relative to previous studies (e.g. R\u223c37\n000 in C01 and R\u223c20 000 in Barbuy et al. 1999). The analysis is restricted to relatively hot (Teff > 4000 K) stars, in\norder to avoid the above mentioned problems with molecular bands.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Spectroscopic observations are described in Sect. 2. Sect. 3 focuses on\nthe determination of the stellar parameters: effective temperature and gravity from photometry and spectroscopy.\nEquivalent width and oscillator strenghts are discussed in\nSect. 3. Iron abundance is derived in Sect. 4 and abundance ratios in Sect. 5. The results are then discussed in\nSect. 6.\n\n2. The Data\n2.1. Imaging\nV and I photometry of the central region of NGC 6528 was\nobtained using two sets of WFPC2 observations with the\nHubble Space Telescope (HST), (GO5436: Ortolani et al.\n1995, and GO8696: Feltzing and Johnson 2002). Infrared\nJ, H, Ks observations were obtained with the SOFI infrared camera of the ESO New Technology Telescope\n(NTT). The details about both optical and near-IR data\nare given in Momany et al. (2003).\nFive isolated stars were selected from our sample for\nspectroscopic observations (Fig. 1). The target location\non both the SOFI near-IR and the HST optical CMD is\nshown in Fig. 2.\nTable 1 lists the coordinates, magnitudes and colours\nof the sample stars. The star's identifications follow the\nnotation by van den Bergh & Younger (1979), where the\nprefix I corresponds to the internal ring. For each star the\nfirst line corresponds to the original magnitudes, while the\nsecond line corresponds to the magnitudes corrected for\ntotal (see Sect. 3.1) and differential extinction. The latter\ncorrection has been carried out following the method described in Piotto et al. (1999) and Zoccali et al. (2001).\nThis method assumes that the shift relative to the RGB\nfiducial mean locus, between different subregions, is dominated by differential reddening. The observed field is divided into small subregions, and the reddening of each of\nthem is estimated by comparison with the fiducial mean\nlocus of NGC 6528 from Momany et al. (2003). The result of this procedure for the (V ,V \u2212 I) CMD is shown in\nFig. 3.\n\nFig. 1. Finding chart for the 5 stars observed in NGC 6528\n(HST WFPC2 F814W image). Resolution is 0.1\"/px.\nA posteriori, we identified some of our targets also\nin the field of view of a J, H set of NICMOS@HST\ndata (Ortolani et al. 2001). The spatial resolution of the\nNICMOS observations allowed us to discover that I-16 has\nin fact a nearby companion which contaminates the spectrum by about 23% in the J and H bands (see Fig. 4).\n\n\fM.

Spectra\nHigh resolution spectra for five members of NGC 6528,\nin the wavelength range \u03bb\u03bb 4800-6800 \u00c5, were obtained\nwith the UVES spectrograph at the ESO VLT. The target membership had been previously verified from radial\nvelocities by Coelho et al. (2001). In what follows we will\nconsider mainly the reddest portion of the spectrum (58006800 \u00c5) covered by the MIT backside illuminated and AR\ncoated CCD ESO # 20 of 4096x2048 pixels, of pixel size\n15x15\u03bcm. The bluer region was used only to derive the\ncarbon abundance from the C2 (0,1) bandhead at \u03bb 5635\n\u00c5.

The log\nof the observations is shown in Table 2.\nThe spectra were reduced using the UVES context of\nthe MIDAS reduction package, including bias and interorder background subtraction, flatfield correction, extraction and wavelength calibration (Ballester et al. 2000).\nWhen possible we used the optimal extraction routine, rejecting the cosmic rays. However, in a few cases (e.g. star\nI16 and I18, which were observed through the same slit),\nthe optimal extraction could not be used, and therefore we\nturned to the standard extraction routine.

(2003), however this was a mean value from determinations relative to NGC 6553 and 47 Tucanae, in different\ncolours (see their Table 3), and those values are somewhat\ndependent on the metallicity and \u03b1-element assumptions\nin isochrone models. They can be used as guidelines, but\nfor temperature determinations we need to investigate further about the value to adopt, since a \u2206E(B-V) = 0.07\nimplies in a \u2206Teff \u2248 400 K.\n\n(S/N)/px\n\n40\n30\n40\n30\n\nSlit\n\nvrobs\n\nvrhel.\n\nwidth\n\nkms\u22121\n\nkms\u22121\n\n1.0\u2032\u2032\n\"\n1.0\u2032\u2032\n\"\n1.0\u2032\u2032\n\"\n1.0\u2032\u2032\n\"\n0.8\u2032\u2032\n\"\n\n208\n\"\n211\n\"\n215\n\"\n218\n\"\n222\n\"\n\n206\n\"\n209\n\"\n213\n\"\n217\n\"\n215\n\"\n\nReddening vs. spectral type:\nA very well established result, after the analysis of\nSchmidt-Kaler (1961), is that the absorption (in the U BV\nbands) is a function of the the energy distribution of the\nstar within the broadband filters (see also more recent\ndiscussions and calculations in Olson 1975, Grebel and\nRoberts 1995, and Fitzpatrick 1999). Such effect is due to\nthe decrease of the extinction, toward longer wavelengths,\nacross the width of the filter. The net effect results in\na shift of the effective wavelength, for a reddened star,\nto a longer wavelength than for an unreddened star. The\nmagnitude of the shift depends on the energy distribution\n(therefore on the spectral type) of the star. This makes\nredder (cooler) stars systematically less absorbed. The effect is more pronounced in the B band than in V, for the\nsame amount of interstellar dust, and thus the colour excess becomes sensitive to the stellar energy distribution.\nSchmidt-Kaler (1961) introduced a parameter \u03b7 to quantify this effect:\n\u03b7 = E(B-V)(SpT) /E(B-V)B0\nand showed that its variation is of the order of 10% from\nearly type stars to M stars. \u03b7 is also slightly dependent on\nthe reddening itself.\nNGC 6522 is another globular cluster located in the\nBaade's Window that can be used to derive colour excess\nin the region. The work by Terndrup & Walker (1994)\non several fields in NGC 6522 gives E(B-V)=0.52 for BV=0 stars, corresponding to about 0.44-0.45 for our K-M\nstars. This is done via a simple fit to CMDs relative to\nother globular clusters having the same RGB morphology.\nTerndrup et al. (1998) derived Av=1.4 on a proper motion cleaned CMD of NGC 6522. This gives again about\nE(B-V)=0.45 for K-M stars. We can conclude that there\nis quite strong evidence that NGC 6522 has a reddening close to 0.44-0.45. Now we should estimate the difference between NGC 6528 and NGC 6522. A check on\nStanek's (1996) maps indicates that the two regions have\nvery similar extinctions. The zero point has been revised\nby Alcock et al. (1998) and Gould et al. (1998). Following\n\n\fM. Zoccali et al.: Metal content of NGC 6528\n\nAlcock et al., from their Table 1, the extinction near\nNGC 6528 (at \u03b1=18h04m 29.46s , \u03b4=-30\u25e601' 07\", J2000.0)\nis \u2206AV =0.05 mag higher than near NGC 6522. Using a\ntotal-to-selective absorption R = AV /E(B-V) = 3.1, this\ntransforms into E(B-V)= 0.01 - 0.02 mag, which makes\na very small difference. The same authors derived E(BV)=0.48 for (B-V)=0.0 stars for the less redenned side\nof the Baade Window, corresponding to one of the lowest values (about 0.42 for K-M stars). They strongly argue against high values. Since they start from luminosity\nmeasurements of the RR Lyrae stars, they have to make\nassumptions about the total-to-selective absorption RV =\nAV /E(B-V) value to get the E(B-V), but still this appears\nto be a quite firm result.\nWe carried out an independent reddening measurement for NGC 6522 using HST photometry from Piotto et\nal. (2002). The CMD of NGC 6522 was compared to those\nof reference clusters, having comparable metallicities, and\nwhich have been observed in with the same HST instrumentation. The reddening difference between NGC 6522\nand each reference cluster is measured as the colour difference of their red giant branches, \u2206(B-V)RGB =\u2206 E(B-V),\nas shown in Table 3.\nA cluster metallicity can be estimated from the\ncurvature of the RGB, since more metal-rich giants show progressively fainter RGB magnitudes (as\nwell as redder RGB colours), due to higher blanketing (Ortolani et al. 1990, 1991). The metallicities reported are from Harris (1996, as updated in\nhttp://physun.physics.mcmaster.ca/Globular.html). Note\nthat the more metal rich clusters will give obviously a bit\nlower reddening and viceversa: M 13, NGC 6681 and NGC\n1904 appear to have a more metal poor morphology as\nconcerning the RGB, and give higher \u2206(B-V). The E(BV) = \u2206(B-V) would be given by comparing two clusters\nof same metallicity, given that there should be no blanketing differences between them. The best morphological\nfits are obtained for NGC 5904 (M5), NGC 1851 and NGC\n6266. Harris (1996) gives [Fe/H]=-1.44 for NGC 6522, and\nin these cases the derived \u2206(B-V) is close to the E(B-V)\nvalue. In conclusion, it seems that E(B-V)=0.42-0.50 represents a fiducial reddening value for NGC 6522 for the\ncolour of horizontal branch to G-K stars.\nIn order to obtain the reddening for NGC 6528 we\nwould have to add the reddening difference between the\nformer and NGC 6522 (+0.02), but another \u2206E(B-V)=\n\u22120.02 would be needed to translate this for K-M stars (c.f.\nparameter \u03b7 defined above). Therefore, for our stars, we\nadopt the same reddening E(B-V)=0.46\u00b10.04 determined\nabove for NGC 6522. Note that this result is independent\nof possible zero point errors in the Piotto et al. photometry\nbecause it is based on differential photometry.\nYet another free parameter comes into play, because\nthe extinction law towards the bulge is somewhat controversial. Extremely low values of the total-to-selective\nabsorption RV = AV /E(B-V) were recently proposed by\ne.g. Udalski (2003) in the galactic bulge OGLE II field,\nas opposed to the traditional RV =3.1 from Cardelli et al.\n\n5\n\nTable 3.

For completeness, let\nus recall that the total-to-selective absorption RV depends\non the amount of reddening (Olson 1975) and on metallicity (Grebel & Roberts 1995), as discussed in Barbuy et al.\n(1998), and the value should be somewhat higher for high\nreddening and high metallicity values. If lower RV values\nare assumed, our resulting dereddened colours will be redder, and therefore the deduced effective temperatures will\nbe cooler.\nFor the present analysis we adopt E(B-V) = 0.46 for\nNGC 6528 and the extinction law given by Dean et al.\n(1978) and Rieke & Lebofsky (1985), namely: RV = 3.1,\nE(V \u2212 I)/E(B \u2212 V )=1.33, E(V \u2212 K)/E(B \u2212 V )=2.744 and\nE(J \u2212 K)/E(B \u2212 V )=0.527 (Table 1).\n\n3.2. Temperatures\nEffective temperatures were derived from V \u2212 K, V \u2212 I\nand J \u2212 K using the colour-temperature calibrations by\nAlonso et al. (1999) together with the reddening laws by\nDean et al. (1978) and Rieke & Lebofsky (1985). The Teff\nderived from each colour are listed in Table 4. We have\nexcluded from the spectroscopic analysis the star I-16 as\nexplained in Sect. 2.1, and also star I-24, being a suspect unresolved binary, for the reasons explained below\n(Sect. 4). In order to verify that all the colours are compatible with the adopted temperature, we compared the\nspectral energy distribution (SED) of our targets with the\nprediction by Alonso et al. (1999). Fig. 5 shows the flux\nobtained from the V, I, J, H and K magnitudes, together\nwith Alonso et al.'s calibrations for stars of different temperatures (4000-5250 K). Since Alonso et al. give a relation\nbetween colours and temperatures, the predicted flux in\neach band was obtained by assuming an arbitrary value\nfor the V magnitude. A vertical shift was then allowed to\nmatch the SEDs of the sample stars.\n\n\f6\n\nM. Zoccali et al.: Metal content of NGC 6528\n\nTable 4.

Star I-24\nshows lines with FWHM significantly larger than that of\nthe other stars (a factor of 1.5), and most of the lines have\na systematic asymmetry (Fig. 6). This was interpreted as\nevidence of the presence of an unresolved companion, and\nfor this reason the star was excluded from the following\nanalysis. Note that at lower spectral resolution such unresolved binaries would not have been detected, and therefore the results would not have reflected the true stellar\nabundances.\n\nFig. 5.

Gravities\nThe classical relation log g\u2217 = 4.44 + 4 log(T\u2217 /T\u2299 ) +\n0.4(Mbol \u2212 4.75) + log(M\u2217 /M\u2299 ) was used, adopting T\u2299\n= 5770 K, M\u2217 = 0.85 M\u2299 and Mbol\u2299 = 4.75 (Cram 1999).\nA distance modulus of (m-M)0 = 15.10 was adopted\nfrom Harris (1996) together with a reddening of E(B \u2212\nV ) = 0.46 and AV = 1.43, as discussed in the previous\nsections. The bolometric corrections from Alonso et al.\n(1999) and corresponding gravities are given in Table 4.\nSpectroscopic gravities were also derived by imposing ionization equilibrium between FeI and FeII lines (see\nSect. 4).\n\n4. Equivalent widths and oscillator strengths\nThe equivalent widths have been measured using a new\nautomatic code developed by P. Stetson (DAOSPEC,\nStetson et al. 2004, in preparation). This routine fits a\n\nFig. 6. Spectrum of I24 showing its probable binary nature.\nThe Fe I line list and respective oscillator strengths\ngiven in NIST (Martin et al. 2002) and some lines with\ngf-values from McWilliam & Rich (1994, hereafter MR94)\nwere used to derive spectroscopic parameters. Eight measurable Fe II lines, and their respective oscillator strengths\nfrom Bi\u00e9mont et al. (1991), and renormalized by Mel\u00e9ndez\n& Barbuy (2004, in prepararion), were used to obtain ionization equilibrium.\nThe damping constants were computed where possible, and in particular for most of the Fe I lines, using the\ncollisional broadening theory of Barklem et al. (1998, 2000\n\n\fM. Zoccali et al.: Metal content of NGC 6528\n\nand references therein). For lines of Si, Ca and Ti the derived values of the interaction constant C6 , where C6 =\n6.46E-34 (\u03c3/63.65)5/2 , \u03c3 being the cross section of collision computed by Barklem et al., which is related to the\n2/5\ncollisional damping constant \u03b36 = 17v3/5 C6 N, are reported in Table 6. Otherwise a fit to the solar spectrum or\nstandard van der Waals values (Uns\u00f6ld 1955; Gray 1976)\nare employed.\nThe oscillator strengths of Na, Mg, Si, Ca and Ti lines\ngiven by Brown & Wallerstein (1992), MR94, the NIST\ndatabase (Martin et al. 2002), Barbuy et al. (1999) from\nfits to the solar spectrum, the VALD database (Kupka\net al. 1999), and the recent compilation by Bensby et\nal. (2003) are reported in Table 6. The adopted oscillator strengths for these lines were then selected from a fit\nto the solar spectrum observed with the same VLT-UVES\ninstrumentation, adopting a NMARCS solar atmospheric\nmodel (Edvardsson et al. 1993), in order to be compatible with the model grid used to analyse the sample giants. These gf-values were checked against the spectrum\nof Arcturus (Hinkle et al. 2000), by adopting the stellar\nparameters derived by Mel\u00e9ndez et al. (2003), namely Teff\n= 4275 K, log g = 1.55, [Fe/H] = -0.54, vt = 1.65 km s\u22121\nand abundances [C/Fe] = -0.08, [N/Fe] = +0.3, [O/Fe]\n= +0.43, and other abundance ratios from the literature,\nand rederived from our fits: [Na/Fe] = +0.1, [Mg/Fe] =\n+0.35, [Al/Fe] = +0.3, [Si/Fe] = +0.25, [Ca/Fe] = +0.1,\n[Ti/Fe] = +0.3. The selected gf-values are marked in bold\nface in Table 6.\nFor the oxygen forbidden line [OI]6300 \u00c5 we adopt the\noscillator strength recently derived by Allende Prieto et al.\n(2001): log gf = -9.716.\nFor lines of the heavy elements BaII, LaII and EuII,\na hyperfine structure was taken into account, based on\nthe hyperfine constants by Lawler et al. (2001a) for EuII,\nLawler et al. (2001b) for LaII and Biehl (1976) for BaII.\nSolar abundances were adopted from Grevesse et al.\n(1996), except for the value for oxygen where \u01eb(O) = 8.77\nwas assumed, as recommended by Allende Prieto et al.\n(2001) for the use of 1-D model atmospheres.\n\n5. Iron abundances\nPhotospheric 1-D models for the sample giants were extracted from the NMARCS grid (Plez et al. 1992), originally developed by Bell et al. (1976) and Gustafsson et al.\n(1975).\nThe LTE abundance analysis and the spectrum synthesis calculations were performed using the codes by\nSpite (1967, and subsequent improvements made in the\nlast thirty years), Cayrel et al. (1991) and Barbuy et al.\n(2003).\nThe stellar parameters were derived by initially adopting the photometric effective temperature and gravity,\nand then further constraining the temperature by imposing excitation equilibrium for Fe I lines and the gravity by imposing ionization equilibrium for Fe I and Fe II.\n\n7\n\nMicroturbulence velocity vt was determined by canceling\nthe trend of Fe abundance vs. equivalent width.\nThe same method and the same line list, applied to the\nSun and Arcturus, yield metallicities of [Fe I/H] = 0.09,\n[Fe II/H] = 0.01 and [Fe I/H] = -0.49, [Fe II/H] = -0.56\nrespectively. Note that in this case the stellar parameters\nthat we converged to are Teff 5800 K, log g = 4.4, vt =\n1.0 km s\u22121 for the Sun and Teff = 4300 K, log g = 1.8,\nvt = 1.6 km s\u22121 for Arcturus, in good agreement with\nexpectations.\nTable 5 reports [Fe I/H] and [Fe II/H] values for the\nsample stars. Figs. 7, 8 and 9 illustrate the results of\nthe analysis for stars I-18, I-36 and I-42 respectively. The\nabundances from Fe II lines for star I-42 showed relatively\nlarge scatter, possibly due to a combination of the lower\nS/N and cooler temperature. We therefore compared the\nequivalent width of Fe II lines in I-42 with those of I-36,\nhaving very similar Teff , and rejected the lines showing\nlarge deviations from the mean percent difference. This\nallowed us to have a smaller dispersion in [Fe II/H] and\ntherefore to get a spectroscopic constraint on the gravity\nfor I-42.\nA second set of parameters based on the photometry\nwas derived by imposing the temperature and gravity values from Table 4 and determining the metallicity and the\nmicroturbulence velocity from Fe I and Fe II. The two sets\nof stellar parameters are given in Table 5.\nAs a check ionization equilibrium was also used as a\ntemperature indicator, as suggested by McWilliam & Rich\n(2003, hereafter MR03), keeping the gravity fixed to its\nphotometric value, and varying the temperature to recover\nthe Fe ionization equilibrium. This leads to temperatures\nin better agreement with the photometric values, while\nkeeping excitation equilibrium virtually identical to the\nformally best fitting spectroscopic temperature.\nThis shows that the true temperature of the sample\nstars is very likely hotter (by \u223c 200 K) than the photometric one. In the following we will keep this last set of\nparameters as the one which gives the most self consistent\npicture. The errors on [Fe/H] were estimated as follows.\nThe formal error on the slope in the FeI vs. ionization potential implies an error in the temperature of \u00b1100 K for\nall the stars. From the abundance analysis of Arcturus, we\nestimated that a variation of \u00b1 100 K in the temperature\npropagates into a difference of \u00b10.07 in [FeI/H] and \u00b10.06\nin [FeII/H]. This variation in the metallicity of Arcturus\nwas found by forcing excitation equilibrium (i.e, by fixing\nthe gravity) and canceling the trend in abundance with\nE.W. (i.e., by fixing vt ) with the new (uncertain by \u00b1100\nK) temperatures. This procedure gives an estimate of the\nsystematic error due to a possible uncertain assumption on\nthe input parameters. The statistical error, measured from\nthe spread in abundance obtained from different lines, is\n0.018 < \u2206[FeI/H] < 0.026 for the three stars. The final\nerror, being the quadratic sum of the systematic and statistical components, is quoted in Table 5.\n\n\f8\n\nM. Zoccali et al.: Metal content of NGC 6528\n\nTable 5.

The\nflattening of the FeI abundance with \u03c7ex and E.W. has\nbeen used to set constraints on the temperature and microturbulence velocity, respectively.\n\n6. Abundance ratios\nElemental abundances were obtained through line-by-line\nspectrum synthesis calculations, for the line list given in\nTables 6 and 7.\nThe calculations of synthetic spectra were carried out\nas described in Cayrel et al. (1991) and Barbuy et al.\n\nFig. 9. Same as Fig. 7 for star I-42.\n(2003), where molecular lines of CN (A2 \u03a0-X2 \u03a3), C2 Swan\n(A3 \u03a0-X3 \u03a0), TiO (A3 \u03a6-X3 \u2206) \u03b3 and TiO (B3 \u03a0-X3 \u2206) \u03b3'\nsystems are taken into account. As a first guess, the\nabundances obtained from the equivalent width, in the\n\"classical\" way, without taking into account the effect of\nmolecules, were adopted. These first guess values are listed\nin Table 8.\nThe comparison between the synthetic spectrum, generated including the effects of molecules, and the observed\n\n\fM. Zoccali et al.: Metal content of NGC 6528\n\none, for each line in Table 6, allowed us to set a more realistic estimate of the true abundance ratios. Our best values\nare listed in Table 9. The comparison between Table 8 and\nTable 9 gives an estimate of the importance of the effect\nof molecule formation in the atmosphere of each star. The\nmain effect is a lowering of the continuum as illustrated in\nFig 10, where TiO was computed for [O/Fe]=[Ti/Fe]= 0.0\nand +0.2 (the latter value is the adopted one), and for\nTeff = 4000, 4100 and 4200 K.\n\n9\n\nFigs. 11, 12, 13 show examples of the fit of Oxygen,\nCalcium and Titanium lines, respectively, in the three\nsample stars. While the abundance of [O/Fe] and [Ca/Fe]\nis very homogeneuos in the three stars, Titanium is considerably higher in star I-42. Fig. 13 shows, for comparison,\nalso a model with low Ti ([Ti/Fe]=-0.2) with the stellar\nparameters of I-42. Clearly such low Ti for I-42 can be\nexcluded from the present data.\nThe fit of the Oxygen line [OI]6300.311 \u00c5 shown in\nFig. 11 also shows the nearby ScII 6300.67 line. Sneden &\nPrimas (2001) pointed out that the ratio of [OI] to ScII\nlines is a more reliable measure of the oxygen enhancement. Indeed, OI and ScII are the dominant species of\nthese elements in cool stellar atmospheres, and excitation\npotentials of the [OI]6300.31 \u00c5 (\u03c7ex = 0.0 eV ) and that\nof ScII6300.67 \u00c5 (\u03c7ex = 1.5 eV) are similar. We used a\nhyperfine structure splitting and corresponding log gf of\nthe ScII line as given in Spite et al. (1989). The present\nanalysis gives [O/Sc]=+0.35, +0.35 and +0.20 for I-18,\nI-36 and I-42, respectively.\nThe line-by-line abundance ratios are given in Table 6,\nwhile the final resulting abundance ratios for the 3 sample stars, together with their mean, are shown in Table 9.\nColumn 7 lists the results for the 4 HB stars analysed by\nC01 and column 8 shows the average of Baade's Window\n11 K giants analysed by MR94. There is a general good\nagreement with respect to C01, except for a difference of\n0.2 dex in [FeI/H], and the Si, Ca and BaII abundances\nwhich are higher in their study. The Mg, Al and Ti abundances found by MR94 in Baade's Window are higher than\nthe values found in the present paper and in C01.\n\nFig. 10. TiO \u03b3' bandhead in star I-42, where spectra\nare convolved with gaussians of FWHM = 2.0 \u00c5: a)\ncomputed with [O/Fe]=[Ti/Fe] = 0.0 and +0.2 (adopted\nvalue); b) comparison of the observed spectrum (dotted line) with model computed with Teff = 4100 K and\n[O/Fe]=[Ti/Fe]=+0.2; c) Teff = 4000, 4100 and 4200 K.\nErrors in the abundance ratios can be due essentially\nto gf-values and damping constants used. They can be\ndeduced from Table 6, where a difference of 0.2 dex in log\ngf essentially means a difference of 0.2 dex in abundance,\nfor a given damping constant.\nThe carbon abundance [C/Fe] = 0.0 was derived for\nthe 3 sample stars, based on the C2 (0,1) 5635 \u00c5, whereas\nthe nitrogen abundance [N/Fe] = +0.6 was derived from a\nseries of CN bandheads along the spectrum. The region of\nthe C2 line is very noisy, and the whole region is blended\nwith CN lines as well, such that the carbon abundance\nis not as precise as all the other derivations in this work.\nOn the other hand, C+N is reliable. The N overabundance corresponds to a mixing that is expected in giants,\nbringing carbon down and nitrogen up, but since C+N is\nhigh, it does possibly involve as well a primordial enhancement in C+N elements, as detected before in NGC 6553\n(Mel\u00e9ndez et al. 2003).\n\nFig. 11.

Discussion and Conclusions\nWe have derived element abundances for three giants in\nthe globular cluster NGC 6528. Five targets were originally selected. However, the high spatial resolution of the\nHST/NICMOS imaging frames, and the high UVES spectral resolution showed that two of them are in fact a blend\nof two stars (I-24 is likely a physical binary), and for this\nreason the two objects have been excluded from the analysis.\nThis case shows how strong can be the effect of projection or physical binaries in similar studies, when high\nspatial resolution images of the field are not available.\n\nSpecies\n\nNo.\n\nI-18\n\nI-36\n\n[FeI/H]\n[OI/Fe]\n[OI/Sc]\n[NaI/Fe]\n[MgI/Fe]\n[SiI/Fe]\n[CaI/Fe]\n[TiI/Fe]\n[TiII/Fe]\n\n50\n1\n1\n2\n4\n3\n7\n6\n1\n\n\u20130.05\n+0.10\n+0.35\n+0.60\n+0.05\n+0.05\n\u20130.40\n\u20130.30\n\u20130.20\n\n\u20130.13\n+0.15\n+0.35\n+0.40\n+0.05\n+0.10\n\u20130.40\n\u20130.20\n\u20130.20\n\nI-42\n\nmean\n\n\u20130.14 \u20130.11\n+0.20 +0.15\n+0.20 +0.30\n+0.30 +0.43\n+0.10 +0.07\n+0.10 +0.08\n\u20130.40 \u20130.40\n+0.20 \u20130.10?\n+0.05 \u20130.12?\n\nC01 MR94\n+0.07\n+0.07\n+0.17\n+0.40\n+0.14\n+0.36\n+0.23\n+0.03\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n+0.03\n\u2013\n+0.20\n+0.35\n+0.14\n+0.14\n+0.37\n\u2013\n\nFrom the abundance analysis we conclude that Iron is\nabout solar: [Fe/H]\u223c \u22120.1.\nThe odd-Z element sodium, built up during carbon\nburning, is strongly overabundant ([Na/Fe]\u223c 0.4).\nThe \u03b1-elements show a quite peculiar behaviour. O,\nMg and Si are just slightly above the solar value ([O/Fe]\n\u223c[Mg/Fe]\u223c [Si/Fe]\u223c0.1) while Ca and Ti are underabundant with respect to the Sun ([Ca/Fe]\u223c \u22120.40 [Ti/Fe]\u223c\n\u22120.2). It is also somehow puzzling that despite the very\ngood agreement between the abundances derived from different lines in the same star (Table 6), the three stars show\na spread in [Ti/Fe]. In particular, star I-42 shows a higher\nTi abundance with respect to the other two. Given its\n\n\fM. Zoccali et al.: Metal content of NGC 6528\n\nradial velocity, the similarity with I-18 and I-36 in the\nabundances of all the other elements, and the agreement\nbetween its photometric and spectroscopic temperature,\nwe tend to discard the hypothesis of it being a field star\njust accidentally projected on the cluster RGB sequence.\nWe rather believe that its low temperature makes stronger\nthe effect of the TiO molecules in its atmosphere, which\nalso increases our uncertainty in the abundance analysis.\nThe comparison between our values and the ones in\nCarretta et al. (2001) reveals some discrepancies in Si,\nCa, and Ti. While the different treatment of molecules in\nthe two analyses (Carretta et al. did not account for them)\nmight explain part of the discrepancy, the large (0.6 dex)\ndifference in the Ca abundance has to arise from some\nother factor. From an independent analysis of the equivalenth widths of the NGC6528 stars observed by Carretta\net al. (2001), MR03 found [Ca/Fe]=+0.2, much closer to\nthe value found here. Comparing the three analyses, it\nseems that the most probable source of discrepancy is the\nadopted broadening factors. Indeed, it must be noted that\nall the CaI lines are rather strong, in the saturation regime\nof the curve of growth.\nIn fact the abundances of Ca and Ti do not always\nfollow the other \u03b1-elements, as is the case for example\nwith 47 Tucanae where Ca-to-Fe is solar, and the other \u03b1s\nare overabundant (Brown & Wallerstein 1992; Alves-Brito\net al. 2004). According to Woosley (private communication), there is metallicity sensitivity in the yields because\nthe mass loss varies with metallicity. The yields therefore\nstrongly depend on the mass loss, such that Ca and Ti\nshow variable proportions in different sites (Woosley &\nWeaver 1995), and [Ti/Si] is often low.\nFrom our analysis we find a modest enhancement of O,\nMg and Si, which is consistent with the trend of a lower\n\u03b1-enhancement for the metal-rich end of the bulge field\nstars found by McWilliam & Rich (2003). However, the\npredictions by Matteucci & Brocato (1990) and Matteucci,\nRomano and Molaro (1999) give higher expected values\nfor O and Mg ([O/Fe] \u223c [Mg/Fe] \u223c +0.6 at [Fe/H] =\n0.0, and somewhat less for Si and Ca ([Si/Fe] \u223c [Ca/Fe]\n\u223c +0.3). On the other hand, the low values of [Ca/Fe]\n\u2248 [Ti/Fe] \u2248 [Eu/Fe] \u2248 0.0 might indicate that there has\nbeen a deficiency of SNII of low mass, as pointed out in\nMR03, and according to predictions by Woosley & Weaver\n(1995). It is also worth noticing that Ca underabundance\nis very common in elliptical galaxies (e.g. Thomas et al.\n2003 for a discussion of possible causes).\nThe s-process elements Ba, La tend to show underabundances which is expected for an old population. The\ns-processing takes place in massive stars (Raiteri et al.\n1993), as well as in relatively short lived and long lived\nintermediate mass stars (Gallino et al. 1998), indicating\nthat there has been no significant contribution from long\nlived stars.\nAcknowledgements.
