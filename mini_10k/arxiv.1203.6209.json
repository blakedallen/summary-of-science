Introduction\nLarge-scale solar transient phenomena (solar flares and CMEs) are examples of\nthe magnetic dynamical and highly energetic processes of the Sun during which\nthe energy stored in the sheared and twisted magnetic structures is rapidly\nreleased in the form of particle acceleration, plasma heating and bulk mass\nmotion within from a few minutes to a few tens of minutes timescales. However,\nthe exact mechanism of the initiation and triggering of solar flares and coronal\nmass ejections (CMEs) since the discovery of the first flare by R.C. Carrington\non 1st September, 1859 is still not yet known in full details. It is well explored\nthat the flares may occur near the magnetic null points, and current sheets are\nformed by instability near the neutral point where field lines exhibit a magnetic\nreconnection process. Reconnection can be an efficient mechanism of converting\nmagnetic energy to thermal and bulk kinetic energies and to accelerate particles (Benz, 2008). The novel observational signature of 3-D X-type loop-loop\ninteraction and the flare triggering due to reconnection in an active magnetic\ncomplex has recently been reported by Kumar et al. (2010). It is also found that\nthe instabilities (kink, magnetic Kelvin-Helmholtz, coalescence, etc.) can also be\none of the favourable mechanisms to trigger solar flares with or without CMEs\n(Liu, Alexander, and Gilbert, 2007; Srivastava et al., 2010; Kumar et al., 2010;\nFoullon et al., 2011; Botha, Arber, and Srivastava, 2012). In conclusion, appropriately correlated theoretical and observational studies of these phenomena are\nstill needed to be explored to understand the complex dynamical processes at\nthe Sun.\nIn spite of a number of attempts to analyse the energy build-up and energy release processes associated with the eruptive phenomena, the recent trend\nhas also been evolved to study the responses of solar eruptions on the plasma\ndynamics and the generation of periodic (quasi-periodic) oscillation patterns\nduring these energetic events. These natural responses to the highly energetic\nsolar eruptive phenomena are very useful in diagnosing and constraining the local\nplasma conditions of the solar atmosphere. The high-speed plasmoids associated\nwith CME eruptions (Sheeley and Wang, 2002; Manoharan and Kundu, 2003;\nLin et al., 2005; Riley et al., 2007; Milligan et al., 2010), chromospheric evaporation (Veronig et al., 2010), very high-speed outflows (Wang et al., 2006), downflows and plasma condensations (Yokoyama et al., 2001) in the course of flaring activities have been extensively studied. The secondary plasmoids can also\nbe evolved in the eruptive region due to the plasmoid instability in a sufficiently long and thin current layer (Loureiro, Schekochihin, and Cowley, 2007).\nTherefore, they are associated with reconnection, however, not directly with\nCMEs. The ejecta can only generate the favorable conditions for plasmoid instability by formation of elongated and stretched current sheet in the active\nregion. Periodic and quasi-periodic MHD oscillations have also been observed\nand studied as a natural response of the solar flares in their vicinity regions\n(Roberts, Edwin, and Benz, 1983; Aschwanden et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2002;\nFoullon et al., 2005; Ballai, Erd\u00e9lyi, and Pint\u00e9r, 2005; Nakariakov et al., 2006; Taroyan et al., 2007;\nErd\u00e9lyi and Taroyan, 2008). The energy deposited in these MHD oscillations\nare found to be orders of magnitude smaller compared to the flare energy\n\nSOLA: Manus-Blob-Jet-R2.tex; 20 June 2018; 12:16; p. 2\n\n\fSupersonic Plasma Blob\n\nrelease (Terradas, Andries, and Goossens, 2007). On the other hand, flare and\nCME induced waves and oscillations are also very useful to gain first insight\ninto the local plasma conditions and dynamical processes of the active regions\n(Erd\u00e9lyi and Verth, 2007; Andries et al., 2009; Aschwanden, 2009; Taroyan and Erd\u00e9lyi, 2009;\nTerradas, 2009; Ofman, 2009; Ruderman and Erd\u00e9lyi, 2009).\nIn addition to the large-scale motions in terms of flows and ejecta, waves\nand oscillations of magneto-fluids, and energetics of solar eruptions, the formation of small-scale plasma motions, e.g., anemone jets, spicules, penumbral jets\n(De Pontieu, Erd\u00e9lyi, and James, 2004; De Pontieu and Erd\u00e9lyi, 2006; De Pontieu et al., 2007;\nKatsukawa et al., 2007; Kumar, Srivastava, and Dwivedi, 2011), waves in form\nof transient pulses and wave-packets (Zaqarashvili, Kukhianidze, and Khodachenko, 2010;\nMurawski and Zaqarashvili, 2010; Srivastava and Dwivedi, 2010) are important\nin observations to understand the heating and dynamics of the solar plasma at\nsmall spatio-temporal scales. These MHD/HD pulses may also be important to\npower small-scale transients in the lower solar atmosphere (Murawski and Zaqarashvili, 2010).\nThe theory of MHD pulses and wave excitation are somewhat established (Roberts and Webb, 1979;\nCarlsson, Judge, and Wilhelm, 1997; Selwa and Ofman, 2010; Selwa, Ofman, and Murawski, 2007;\nMurawski and Zaqarashvili, 2010). However, observational signatures are not\nvery abundant in past few years to understand their role in the excitation of solar\ntransients (e.g., jets at various spatio-temporal scales). On the other hand, the\nrole of magnetic reconnection, twisted flux emergence from sub-photospheric layers, and generation of instabilities are well-studied both in observations and theories in the jet productive regions (Culhane et al., 2007; Nishizuka et al., 2008;\nFilippov, Golub, and Koutchmy, 2009; Pariat, Antiochos, and DeVore, 2009).\nIn the present paper, we analyze multi-wavelength imaging data of the Active\nRegion NOAA AR 10808 that has produced violent explosions in the form of\ngiant solar flares and associated eruptions. However, this active region has exhibited a very interesting phenomena, surprisingly rather quietly before an M-class\nflare on 9 September 2005, in the form of a supersonic cylindrical plasma blob\nejection from the flare site between 05:27 UT and 5:33 UT. The blob was observed\nby TRACE 171 \u00c5 and also in H\u03b1 image sequences captured by Culgoora Solar\nObservatory, Australia. We present the observational data in Sec. 2. A numerical\nmodelling and the theoretical interpretations of the supersonic plasma blob is\ndescribed in Sec. 3. The results and discussions are given in the last section.\n\n2. Observations of Supersonic Plasma Blob\nActive Region NOAA 10808 has appeared on the east limb on 07 September 2005 and produced at least 10 X-class and 25 M-class solar flares until it disappeared behind the solar-disk (Nagashima et al., 2007). The active\nregion was located nearby the eastern limb of the southern hemisphere near\nthe equatorial plane at S10E67 with \u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 field configuration of the sunspot\ngroup. This active region was also associated with CMEs and filament eruptions, and produced numerous space weather activities by its furious eruptive\nevents (Archontis and Hood, 2010; Canou et al., 2009; Nagashima et al., 2007;\nWang et al., 2006; Li et al., 2007). Figure 1 shows the coronal image of AR 10808\n\nSOLA: Manus-Blob-Jet-R2.tex; 20 June 2018; 12:16; p. 3\n\n\fSrivastava et al.\n\nFigure 1.

Yellow\n(magenta) contours show the positive (negative) polarity of the photospheric magnetic field.\nThe maximum level of the magnetic field contours are \u00b14000 G. For the positive polarity,\nthe two concentric iso-contours of magnetic fields are visible. The plasma blob is shown to be\npropagating up in the solar atmosphere from its origin site associated with maximum magnetic\nfields. The observed configuration of the active region magnetic field is shown in the right panel\non 04:51 UT, which later comes more inside the disk during the transient event.\n\nas observed from the TRACE 171 \u00c5 filter at 05:28:36 UT on 09 September,\n2005. The TRACE field of view is overlaid by co-aligned MDI contours showing\npositive (yellow) and negative (magenta) magnetic polarities (left panel of Figure 1). The positive and negative polarities seem to be elongated respectively\ntowards north-west to south-east, and north-east to south-west, with tonguelike structures (cf., right panel of Figure 1). This is a very typical signature\nof AR10808 and seems to be the evidence of the emergence of twisted rising\nflux (Archontis and Hood, 2010; Li et al., 2007). This typical characteristic of\nthe AR10808 was one of the main causes that were responsible for the very\nenergetic flares, CMEs, and filament eruptions, though the rotation of spots\nand the tilt of the bipolar weightage axis were also observed in this active\nregion (Archontis and Hood, 2010; Canou et al., 2009; Nagashima et al., 2007;\nWang et al., 2006; Li et al., 2007). Although the violent solar eruptions have\nbeen extensively analyzed from this active region, we highlight here an additional\nand an interesting plasma dynamics during an M-class flare that took place for a\nshort duration of about 5-7 minutes on 9 September 2005. The M6.2 class solar\nflare has occurred in AR10808 at the location S10E66. It starts at 05:32 UT,\npeaks at 05:48 UT, and ended at 06:00 UT. The observed short duration plasma\ndynamics that is the interest and theme of this paper, has occurred well before\nthis M6.2 class solar flare just at the flare brightening site.\nFigure 2 shows the time series of TRACE 171 \u00c5 images of the flaring region in\nAR10808 during the time interval 05:24-05:29 UT. The plasma blob (a dark and\ndense material) is formed between 05:24-05:27 UT above the flare site, followed\nby its detachment and propagation upward after 05:27 UT. TRACE has missed\nthe later part of the observations that is, however, captured by H\u03b1 observations from Culgoora Solar Observatory (cf., Figure 4).

Therefore, the projected distance d12\ncovered in \u2206t12 \u224841 s is \u224812,346 km. Thus, the approximate apparent speed\n(v1 ) derived from these two snapshots is \u2248 300 km s\u22121 . At 05:29:15 UT, the\ntail of the blob that is almost constant in shape for around 3-4 mins, reaches\nat (X3 , Y3 )\u2248(-888\", -250\"). Therefore, the distance d23 covered in \u2206t23 \u224839 s is\n\u22486200 km. Assuming the 1\"=725 km scale for the conversion, therefore, derived\napproximate speed (v2 ) is \u2248 160 km s\u22121 that can be obtained as the blob\npropagates. Therefore, the average speed of travel is vav =(v1 +v2 )/2\u2248230 km\ns\u22121 . After this the blob quickly vanishes in the corona. Note that the measured\nspeeds v1 and v2 are projected speeds of the blob by tracing its detached tail,\nand the actual speeds may be higher compared to the estimated speeds. Also\nworth illustrating that these speeds are anyway higher when compared to the\nlocal sound-speed (\u223c150 km s\u22121 ). Next, we trace the approximate position of\n\nSOLA: Manus-Blob-Jet-R2.tex; 20 June 2018; 12:16; p. 5\n\n\fSrivastava et al.\n\nFigure 3. The GOES X-ray profiles show a long duration M-class flare, and its temporal\nrelation with the rising of plasma blob. The initiation and dynamic phases of rise-up are\nlinearly fitted to derive the projected lower bound speeds. The upper and lower linear fits\nrepresent, respectively, the initiation and dynamical phase of blob under the observational\nbaseline of TRACE data. The linear fit between 05:24-05:27 UT corresponds to the position of\nthe leading edge of the blob while the fit at 05:28-05:30 UT shows the position of its trailing\nedge.\n\nthe core of the moving feature in its dynamic phase to find its projected speed\nas \u2248 175 km s\u22121 . Since it is very difficult and somewhat superfluous also to\ntrack the diffused and faint head of the moving feature, therefore, we only take\nthe references of the core and tail of blob observed in the TRACE images to\nestimate the approximate lower bound speeds. In conclusion, the blob plasma\nmoves almost collectively after its origin and detachment from the flaring site\ndue to reconnection. In the TRACE snapshots during 05:24 UT-05:27 UT, it\nis clear that there is some interaction of the rising plasma column that has\ndetached later on in form of a blob, with the pre-existing fields. The magnetic\nfield configuration becomes simpler (cf., 05:28-05:29 UT snapshots) at the origin\nsite of the blob after its detachment.\nNext, the Figure 3 shows the GOES soft X-ray evolution of the M6.2 class\nsolar flare observed in the active region and the corresponding projected timedistance plot of the observed plasma blob in its initiation and dynamic phase\nduring 05:24-05:35 UT is also co-plotted. This is very clear that the blob rises in a\nplasma column with a rather low subsonic speed in its build-up phase (cf., upper\nlinear fit in Figure 3), however, it accelerates in the dynamic detached phase to a\nspeed of 215 km s\u22121 that crosses the sonic speed level and propagation becomes\nsupersonic (cf., lower linear fit in Figure 3). We found that, meanwhile, two more\neruptions have been occurred, respectively, at 05:15 UT and 05:50 UT from\nthe same location (see the attached movie trace-eruptions.avi), however, they\nare exclusively different from the observed unique plasma blob. Firstly, other\neruptions do not propagate in a definite shape of a blob, and secondly they are\n\nSOLA: Manus-Blob-Jet-R2.tex; 20 June 2018; 12:16; p. 6\n\n\fSupersonic Plasma Blob\n\nnot visible simultaneously in the cool H\u03b1 temperature. However, the multiple\nsupersonic eruptions from the same location may be the collective signature of\nrepetitive reconnections ongoing at the flare site. Figure 3 also depicts the linear\nfit in the projected distance of the travel of blob as measured from the TRACE\nimage sequence, and it is also given both in its initiation and detached dynamic\nphases. The linear fit between 05:24-05:27 UT corresponds to the position of\nthe leading edge of the blob in the initiation phase, while the fit at 05:28-05:30\nUT shows the position of its trailing edge in the dynamical phase. The speed\nmeasured in the dynamical phase matches well with the average speed of 230 km\ns\u22121 as measured crudely by analyzing TRACE image sequence. We note that the\nplasma column was built well before the flare event, while the dynamic phase of\nthe blob is achieved just before the rising phase of the flare. The rising speed of\nthe plasma column before the detachment of the blob is \u2248126 km s\u22121 before the\noccurence of the flare event. This phase of the rising of plasma column is clearly\nevident in Figure 2 during 05:24-05:28 UT. The denser and brighter material is\nalso filled in the plasma column during this time span, which later detached in\nform of the observed plasma blob. We measure the speed of the rise-up of this\nplasma column in the initiation phase before the detachment of blob by tracing\nits leading edge during the course of time (cf., snapshots during 05:24-05:28 UT\nin Figure 2, and upper linear fit in Figure 3). While in the dynamic phase, the\nblob gains a supersonic speed of \u2248215 km s\u22121 as per the linear fit measurements,\nduring early rising phase of the gradual M-class solar flare. This measured speed\nis now much more accurate measurement. The average sound speed at the Fe\nXI 171 \u00c5 formation temperature (Tf = 1\u00d7106 K) is \u223c150 km s\u22121 . Therefore,\nthe blob propagates with a supersonic speed, quickly changes its shape, and\nfinally becomes fainter against the background by most likely dissipating its\nenergy and material draining back to the low atmosphere (see the movie traceeruptions.avi). It should be noted that the whole process has two phases: first the\ninitiation phase in which the plasma column and associated cylindrical plasma\nblob is build-up, followed by the second dynamical stage when the plasma blob\nbecome detached and moves up in the corona with a supersonic speed within\nfew minute time scale. The true speed (projected) what is quoted here is in the\ndynamical phase and is consistent both with H\u03b1 and TRACE observations.\nThe H\u03b1 observations of this active region was carried out at Culgoora Solar\nObservatory at Narrabri, Australia by using a 12 cm f/15 Razdow solar patrol\ntelescope equipped with an H\u03b1 filter of the Lyot type that has a pass bandwidth\nof 0.5 \u00c5 . The raw images were recorded by an 8 bit 1024\u00d71024 pixels CCD\ncamera system with pixel size 6.7\u00d76.7 \u03bcm2 . The spatial resolution of the camera\nis 2\u2032\u2032 per pixel. The typical cadence for the present observations is at least 1 frame\nper minute. The observations are carried out with a FOV of the full-disk solar\nimage. Figure 4 shows a sequence of data of the propagating blob emphasized by\na yellow arrow from AR10808 before an M-class flare during 05:26 UT\u201305:36 UT.\nThe difference images of Figure 4 are a 160\u2032\u2032 \u00d7100\u2032\u2032 partial field of view provided\nto us by Culgoora Solar Observatory under its data use policy. Although, the\nresolution of the images is not very high, it should be noted that this is the\nonly H\u03b1 observations that are available from the ground as this unique event\noccurred in its day-light time zone. The temporal H\u03b1 observations are thus very\n\nSOLA: Manus-Blob-Jet-R2.tex; 20 June 2018; 12:16; p. 7\n\n\fSrivastava et al.\n\nuseful and show the unique signature of the propagation of a low-temperature\ncounterpart of the plasma blob observed by TRACE propagating away from the\nflare site towards the eastern limb in a projection. A careful investigation of the\nH\u03b1 image sequence shows that the blob is initially of a cylindrical shape of the\nlength of \u224822 Mm and width of \u22485 Mm. The length and width are found to be\nconsistent with the observed TRACE images in the dynamic phase of the blob.\nTherefore, we conclude that initially the length to width ratio is 4.4. It should\nalso be noted that not only the position but also the length to width ratio may\nalso be influenced by projection effects. The blob changes its shape quickly and\nis faded within 4-5 minutes of its evolution as visible in H\u03b1 at 05:28 UT. The\nmeasured lower bound speed of this propagating blob is found to be \u223c200 km\ns\u22121 . This is again the projected speed of the blob, and the actual speed may be\nhigher compared to this lower bound estimated speed. The average sound speed\nof the H\u03b1 formation temperature (Tf = 1\u00d7104 K) is 15 km s\u22121 . Therefore, the\nblob propagates with supersonic speed.\n\n3. Theoretical Modelling and Interpretation\nAs we have explained in the previous section, the analyses of the H\u03b1 and TRACE\n171 \u00c5 temporal data between 05:24 UT\u201305:36 UT well before an M6.2 class\nflare from AR10808 on 9 September 2005 show the observational evidence of the\nsupersonic plasma blob that propagates in the higher solar atmosphere with a\nsupersonic speed of \u223c 215 km s\u22121 . We firstly explore the possibility of the generation of this supersonic blob as a reconnection-generated plasmoid. The observed\nblob may be the plasmoid as recorded previously by Manoharan and Kundu\n(2003) due to magnetic reconnection during the rising phase of an M-class flare.\nThey have observed the motion of plasma blobs associated with a sigmoid,\nMoreton wave, CME injection in the interplanetary space, and associated radio bursts from AR9393 on 2 April 2001 at 11:00 UT. They have also found\nmagnetic reconnection around a coronal null point as a cause of such eruptions\nand associated phenomena. Recently, the multiple plasmoid and its dynamics\nhave also been observed in solar flares (B\u00e1rta, Karlick\u00fd, and \u017demli\u010dka, 2008;\nNishizuka et al., 2010) . However, such plasmoids are the high-speed plasma\nblobs that accelerate outwards the reconnection point in the solar atmosphere\nand usually are associated with the rising phase of the solar flares. These plasmoids are often released with CME ejections, supersonic down-flows that causes\nthe HXR emissions, and radio bursts (Manoharan and Kundu, 2003). In the\npresent case, the supersonic blob is observed well before the M 6.2 class flare,\nand there is no observational evidence of associated CMEs and radio bursts even\nin this most violent super-active region associated with this flare on 9 September\n2009. Kundu et al. (2001) have reported that the plasmoid ejecta are associated\nwith metric/decimetric emission that starts significantly after the impulsive hard\nX-ray (20 keV) and microwave bursts. In this event, however, we do not observe\nany metric/decimetric or microwave radio emissions as evident in the Culgoora\nand Learmonth radio spectra, and no impulsive hard X-ray emissions are evident\nat that time as per RHESSI X-ray flux profiles. These observed facts possibly\n\nSOLA: Manus-Blob-Jet-R2.tex; 20 June 2018; 12:16; p. 8\n\n\fSupersonic Plasma Blob\n\n\u2732\n\n\u2732\n\n\u2732\n\n\u2732\n\nFigure 4.

In conclusions, although the morphology of the observed blob and\nits dynamics are not favorable for the plasmoid ejection, sometime it may be\ndifficult to distinguish between the plasma blob formed by the reconnection\nrate change and real plasmoids (B\u00e1rta et al., 2007). The detailed analyses of the\nmagnetic field topology can only differenciate between these two. Moreover, a\nsingle plasmoid does not need to be accompanied with radio/HXR emissions\nalways. The most likely interaction of multiple plasmoids may be responsible for\nparticle acceleration and related emissions.\nThe observed plasma blob may be a reconnection-generated jet as per its typical length, time, velocity scales of the coronal jets (Nistic\u00f2 et al., 2009). However,\nwe suggest that the observational evidences point towards more in the form of\na pulse driven blob, which may be a special type of detached jet rather than\na classical jet-like structure. Secondly, the blob is visible both in H-alpha and\nTRACE 171 \u00c5 with similar shape and dynamics, which indicate that it is formed\nby multi-temperature plasma. The bi-directional EUV jets (Innes et al., 1997) are\nthe natural consequences of the flow induced coronal X-type reconnections as\ntheorized by many workers (Petschek, 1964; Roussev et al., 2001). However, the\nvarious types of the classical EUV jet as well as such type of observed plasma\npackets that move radially outwards from the lower solar atmosphere, can either\n\nSOLA: Manus-Blob-Jet-R2.tex; 20 June 2018; 12:16; p. 9\n\n\fSrivastava et al.\n\nFigure 5. Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) extrapolation overplotted on the MDI map\nof 00:04 UT at 9 September 2005 shows the configuration of overlying loops and the position\nof magnetic null point.\n\nbe a direct consequence of the low-atmospheric reconnection of the low-lying\nloop systems (Nistic\u00f2 et al., 2009) or the energy build-up due to some magnetic\ninstabilities (Patsourakos et al., 2008). Therefore, the observed blob may also\nbe the consequence of the low-atmospheric reconnection as also evident in the\nobservations.\nIf the supersonic blob is not a typical form of the ejecta of flaring active regions, e.g., reconnection-generated classical jets, plasmoids etc, then the question\narises about its identification and the most probable drivers during its initiation\nand dynamic phases. Recently Zaqarashvili, Kukhianidze, and Khodachenko (2010)\nhave reported the propagation of sausage solitons in the quiet Sun chromosphere\nusing Hinode/SOT observations. They have reported the propagation of a supersonic plasma blob in the solar chromosphere, which retain the almost constant\nshape (length to width ratio) and obeys the soliton solution. The propagating\nblob reported in this paper here also moves with a supersonic speed, but changes\nits relative intensity amplitude as well as the shape (length to width ratio) within\n3 minutes of its launch at 05:27 UT and, then, quickly vanishes against the\nbackground plasma. Therefore, the soliton description is not the most evident\nand plausible explanation associated with the observations reported here.\nThe interpretation of a kink pulse/wave may be another possibility to drive\nsuch observed plasma blob/jet in its dynamic phase (Kukhianidze, Zaqarashvili, and Khutsishvili, 2006;\nCirtain et al., 2007). However, the axial transversal displacements or a curved\nform of the pulse is not evident in the observations. The density and thus in-\n\nSOLA: Manus-Blob-Jet-R2.tex; 20 June 2018; 12:16; p. 10\n\n\fSupersonic Plasma Blob\n\ntensity enhancement in the associated inclined flux tube is also not evident as\nreported by Cooper, Nakariakov, and Williams (2003). Therefore, the possibility\nof the kink pulse as a driver of the supersonic blob in its dynamic phase, is also\nout of the scope under the baseline of the observations. Another and perhaps\nthe most plausible possibility is then the excitation of a fast MHD pulses/wave\ntrain in the flaring active region as a manifestation of the supersonic blob in\nits dynamic phase. The blob propagates with supersonic speed and vanishes\nquickly in the corona within 3-4 minutes. The blob may be energized by the\nfast wave trains generated in the solar atmosphere (Nakariakov et al., 2004).\nIn such a case, we should observe the quasi-periodic multiple rise and fall of\nthe blob material, which is indeed not evident in the observations presented in\nthe paper. Therefore, the fast MHD pulse train is an unlikely driver for the\nobserved supersonic plasma blob made-up by the multi-temperature plasma. In\nconclusion, the observed blob is neither some classical phenomena of the solar\natmosphere (e.g., Y-shaped typical jets, plasmoids, up-flows etc), nor it is the\nsignature of the peculiar MHD phenomena (e.g., sausage solitons, fast MHD\nwave trains, kink pulses etc).\nTherefore, we suggest that the reconnection-generated velocity pulse at flaring\nsite may be the most likely driver of the plasma blob. The energy release at\nreconnection site in the lower solar atmosphere perturbs the plasma velocity\nand most possibly creates a velocity pulse that trigger the plasma eruption in\nthe form of a supersonic blob. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nobservational signature of the excitation of a velocity pulse driven supersonic\nplasma blob in the solar atmosphere above an active region in the vicinity of\na flare site. The most likely possibility is that the low-lying magnetic loops\nreconnect with each other. This reconnection is at its beginning in the steady\nstate and most probably with a single dissipation region. Since, this reconnection\nregion has so far not reached its dynamical state with many plasmoids created,\ntherefore, low number of particles is accelerated and we do not observe either\nradio or HXR emission. Hence, this steady reconnection gives only the rise of\nthe plasma jet which we observe from the very beginning (e.g., Figure 2, 5:24\nUT snapshot). The formation of the plasma jet during steady state reconnection\nfurther changes into the detached blob propagating in corona. As the reconnection rate and reconnection regime change, a velocity pulse may be generated\nto accelerate the plasma blob. Due to the mass conservation, a density blob\nis formed in the outflow jet, which detaches from the reconnecting loops and\npropagates upwards until it vanishes in the solar corona.\nWe also explore the details of magnetic field topology to understand the\nmost possible generation of such plasma dynamics that we have been observed.\nThe magnetic field configuration and topological distribution of its positive and\nnegative polarities are shown in Figure 1. It is clear from Figure 1 that the\npositive polarity region is stretched towards the west with a remote tongue,\nwhile the negative polarity is stretched towards the east with a remote tongue in\nthe opposite direction as an indicator of the emergence of the twisted magnetic\nfluxes (e.g., Archontis and Hood, 2010; Li et al., 2007). The Potential Field\nSource Surface (PFSS) extrapolation (Figure 5) of the SoHO/MDI at 00:04 UT\non 09 September 2005 also reveals the formation of a coronal null point above a\n\nSOLA: Manus-Blob-Jet-R2.tex; 20 June 2018; 12:16; p. 11\n\n\fSrivastava et al.\n\npositive polarity sunspot which is joining the two segments of oppositely lying\nnegative polarities by bipolar loop systems. This is a very preliminary configuration of the AR magnetic field well before the event, and later phase was\nalso associated with the high flux-emergence and build-up of the complexity in\nthe region (cf., Figure 1, right-panel). This configuration might force the steady\nstate magnetic reconnection in the lower part of the atmosphere. The PFSS is\nslightly shifted in its centroids so that we see clearly the extrapolated field and its\nconfiguration more towards our line-of-sight. In this parasitic region, the central\npositive polarity spot is a unipolar flux region and connecting with the two\nopposite polarity regions on both sides. This is similar situation as the formation\nof a dome-like fan surface where the symmetry axis is known as spine containing\na null point at the intersection with the fan dome (Aschwanden, 2004). Our\nobservations (Figure 5) show a clear evidence of the formation of a parasitic\nregion, i.e., the fan dome, null-point and spine at the flare site in the active\nregion. However, the energy release may be taking place well below this magnetic\nnull point due to pre-emergence and therefore the reconnection process with the\nexisting field lines in the lower solar atmosphere. The field topology in Figure\n5 is following the standard magnetic topology of a 3-D reconnection process\nvia a separator dome (see Figure 10.27 of Aschwanden, 2004 and Fletcher et\nal., 2001). The PFSS extrapolation schematic diagram (extrapolated field lines\nover SoHO/MDI image) approximately matches well with the standard scenario\nof the 3-D reconnection and thus the re-arrangements of the field lines and\nmass motion along open field lines in the vicinity of the null point. However,\nit seems that the steady state reconnection generates the plasma jet in the\nlower solar atmosphere. There may be some small energy release also during the\nmagnetic field rearrangements of the dynamical reconnection process, however,\nit is clear that there is no bulk heating of the plasma before achieving the flare\nmaximum. Moreover, there is no expansion or diffusion of the detached plasma\nalong the field lines outward. Therefore, we discard the acceleration of the blob\ndue to the generation of a thermal pulse by bulk heating. This magnetic field\nre-arrangements during the reconnection process is found to be the driver of\na velocity pulse along the radial direction outward and the observed driven\nsupersonic plasma blob. This type of reconnection scenario drives the plasma\noutward in the radial direction along the spine-lines due to the low-atmospheric\nreconnection between the low-lying loop systems. This reconnection generates a\nvelocity pulse, which associates with a shock steepened in the corona to drive the\nplasma blob. Therefore, we have the consistent observation of an uni-directional\ndetached jet or plasma blob propagating outwards. Recently, the reconnectiongenerated velocity pulse driven jet (Srivastava and Murawski, 2011), and macrospicules (Murawski, Srivastava, and Zaqarashvili, 2011) have already been modeled. However, this is the first attempt to numerically model the reconnection\ngenerated and velocity pulse driven plasma blob in the solar corona.\nHere, the most generic and real situation is that the plasma blob is launched\ndue an initial radial velocity pulse along the magnetic field lines at the triggering site of the blob. The blob is generated approximately 5-6 Mm above the\nphotosphere with the start of the reconnection process. The reconnection at this\nheight in the low-lying quadrapolar loop system may generate the velocity pulse\n\nSOLA: Manus-Blob-Jet-R2.tex; 20 June 2018; 12:16; p. 12\n\n\fSupersonic Plasma Blob\n\nwhich may cause the formation of the supersonic plasma blob propagating up\nin the corona. In the next section, we model numerically the propagation of the\nsupersonic plasma blob generated by a velocity pulse at the reconnection site.\n3.1.

The next snapshot (top right panel) is drawn for t = 100 s. At this time\nthe shock reached the altitude of y \u2243 30 Mm while the cold plasma blob is\nlocated at y \u2243 18 Mm. By the next moment of time (bottom left panel) the\nshock has already moved up to the right boundary and the cool counterpart of\nblob exhibits its developed phase. This is also evident in the H\u03b1 and TRACE\nobservations that a cool core of 10,000 K and hot coronal plasma maintained at\n1-2 MK temperature are simultaneously present in the plasma blob. The shockheated supersonic plasma as well as the cool counterpart both disappear in the\ncorona at t = 600 s (bottom right panel). This matches well the observations. The\nblob already subsided and the plasma began to flow downward, being attracted\nby gravity. In the present simulation, we only assume the reconnection as a\ncause that effectively generates the radial velocity pulse. We do not invoke the\nreconnection generated joule heating in our model as it can generate the thermal\npulse in the ambient medium of certain spatio-temporal scale that can launch\nthe heated plasma in the upward magnetized atmosphere above the reconnection\nregion (Srivastava and Murawski, 2012). Therefore, our model takes the flexibility to not consider any initial conditions generated by reconnection, and we\ninitiate with the launch of the radial velocity pulse triggered due to reconnection\nprocess. We do not invoke therefore either the heating or the losses due to thermal\nconductivity and radiation in our model. The inclusion of these factors will be\nof the subject of our future study.\nFigure 7 displays the spatial profiles of plasma density (colour maps) and velocity (arrows) resulting from the initial velocity pulse which splits into counterpropagating parts. In the snapshot (top right panel) drawn for t = 100 s, the\nshock reached the altitude of y \u2243 30 Mm while the denser cool plasma blob is\nlocated at y \u2243 18 Mm. By the next moment of time (bottom left panel) the\nshock has already moved up to the right boundary and the cool counterpart of\nblob exhibits its developed phase. This is also evident in the H\u03b1 and TRACE\nobservations that a cool and denser core of 10,000 K and comparatively less\ndenser hot coronal plasma maintained at 1-2 MK temperature are simultaneously\npresent in the plasma blob. These findings of numerical simulation validate our\nmulti-wavelength observations of detached blob shaped jet upto some extent.\nThe shock-heated supersonic plasma as well as cool counterpart both disappear\nin the corona at t = 600 s (bottom right panel) that matches well with the\nobservations. The blob already subsided and the plasma began to flow downward, being attracted by gravity. However, the clear-cut detachment of the blob\nmaterial from its origin point is not visible as clearly as in the observations.\n\nSOLA: Manus-Blob-Jet-R2.tex; 20 June 2018; 12:16; p. 15\n\n\fSrivastava et al.\n\nFigure 7. Numerical results : Density (colour maps) and velocity (arrows) profiles at\n\nt = 25 s, 100 s, 150 s, and 600 s (from left-top to right-bottom). Density is drawn in\nlogarithemic density scales. The arrow below each panel represents the length of the\nvelocity vector, expressed in units of 200 km s\u22121 .\n\nFigure 8 illustrates the relative mass density (\u033a \u2212 \u033ae )/\u033ae . that is collected in\ntime at the detection point (x = 20, y = 30) Mm for the case of Figure 7 that\nmimic the observed blob-shaped detached jet. As a result the mass falls off with\nheight and upwardly propagating waves steepen rapidly into shocks. The arrival\nof the first shock front to the detection point is at t \u2243 115 s. The second shock\nfront reaches the detection point at t \u2243 865 s, i.e., after \u223c 750 s. This secondary\nshock results from the reflected wave from the transition region. Therefore, the\nobservation of the intensity (thus density) variations in the detached phase of\nthe blob as evident in H\u03b1 and TRACE, is due to the variation of density in the\nplasma blob by the periodic steepening of velocity pulse.\n4. Discussion and Conclusions\nUsing multi-wavelength observations from TRACE 171 \u00c5 MDI/SoHO, and H\u03b1\nfrom Culgoora Solar Observatory, we have observed a supersonic plasma blob\n\nSOLA: Manus-Blob-Jet-R2.tex; 20 June 2018; 12:16; p. 16\n\n\fSupersonic Plasma Blob\n\nFigure 8. Time-signatures of perturbed mass density collected at (x = 20, y = 30) Mm\n\nfor the case of Figure 7. Time t is expressed in units of 1 s.\n\njust before M6.2 class flare in AR 10808 on 9 September 2005. The blob moves\nwith a supersonic speed of \u223c215 km s\u22121 in its dynamical phase and quickly\nvanishes in the corona. The supersonic speed, vanishing nature, increment of the\nintensity (thus density) followed by its decrement during the life-time of blob,\nall collectively support the excitation of a velocity pulse just in the vicinity of\nthe magnetic null point and reconnection is suggested to be a primary driver.\nAt the same place, the repetitive plasma dynamics at 05:15 UT, and 05:50 UT\nhave also been observed. However, they were much fainter and the blob shape\nplasma eruption was not evident in those processes. Moreover, those eruptions\nwere also not visible in the cool H\u03b1 temperature. Therefore, we have a unique\nobservational signature of the propagation of a supersonic plasma blob during the\nmultiple plasma eruptions at the flare site in AR 10808. This is the most likely\nclue of the occurrence of the repetitive reconnection processes in the observed\nactive region well before and near to M-class flare, which generates the multiple\nplasma eruptions as well as the supersonic blob, which may also be a detached\njet that moves along the spine field lines above the null point.\nThe velocity pulses launched by the photosphere motions and granular power\ncan launch the spicule-like small-scale plasma jets in the lower solar atmosphere\n(Murawski and Zaqarashvili, 2010; Malins and Erd\u00e9lyi, 2007). However, in the\nactive regions, the reconnection event and large energy deposition can generate\nthe strong velocity pulses that launch such type of pulse-driven observed plasma\nblobs. Therefore, the reconnection-generated velocity pulse is found to be an\nefficient driver of the supersonic plasma blob. The energy release by a recurrent 3-D reconnection process via the separator dome below the magnetic null\npoint, between the emerging flux and pre-existing field lines in the lower solar\natmosphere, is found to be the driver of a radial velocity pulse outwards that\naccelerates this plasma blob in the solar atmosphere. The observed magnetic field\nand its extrapolation at the flare site mimic the formation of a 3D null point\nand the reconnection through the separator dome that are well established in\n\nSOLA: Manus-Blob-Jet-R2.tex; 20 June 2018; 12:16; p. 17\n\n\fSrivastava et al.\n\ntheory (Aschwanden, 2004). Our numerical modelling shows the formation of a\nsupersonic plasma blob with a speed of \u223c215 km s\u22121 that is triggered due to\nthe generation of a Gaussian velocity pulse at a height of 5 Mm from the photosphere where the low-lying quadrapolar loop system probably reconnects (cf.,\nFigs 1,2,5). The pulse steepens into shock with the evolution of temperature gradient, and the low pressure behind it causing the uplift of cool low atmospheric\nplasma in the corona. The observation of multi-temperature plasma in the blob\nmatches well with this evolution of the multi-temperature plasma in various\nparts of the simulated plasma blob, i.e., the cool confined material enveloped\nby a heated plasma. The observed supersonic blob powered by reconnectiongenerated velocity pulse may be very significant in fulfilling the coronal energy\nlosses above an active region, if they occur repeatedly in the corona. This is\nthe unique observational evidence of such high-speed energy packets which may\noccur under the particular magnetic field configuration in the flaring regions. If\nwe assume the typical coronal electron density above active region loop-like field\nconfiguration ne =1.0\u00d71010 cm\u22123 , the phase speed Vph =215 km s\u22121 , and the\nnon-thermal speed in form of unresolved mass motions in the coronal plasma\nas Vnt =40 km s\u22121 , then such MHD pulse-driven blobs may carry an energy\nflux of Ef =7.0\u00d7106 ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 to submit in the corona, if their origin is\nnon-thermal as in this case. This energy transport may be very sufficient to\ncontribute to re-balance the coronal losses above active regions.\nIn conclusions, these first observations provide important clues about the\nplasma dynamics driven by a velocity pulse, and its role in energy transport in\nthe solar atmosphere. The rare multiwavelength observations of the blob propagation in the solar corona also provides the clues of steady reconnection process\nin the low atmosphere well before the flaring event. Further multi-wavelength\nobservational studies will be required to shed more light on the transport of\nthe mass and energy by such reconnection generated and pulse driven plasma\neruptions.\nAcknowledgements We acknowledge the remarks of the referee during review process of\nour manuscript.
