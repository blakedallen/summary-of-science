These are unique signatures which\ndistinguish a Kondo breakdown transition from a spin density wave driven transition.\nPACS numbers: 71.27.+a, 72.15.Qm, 75.20.Hr, 75.30.Mb\n\nIntroduction.- Developments in material synthesis\nhave led to the discovery of numerous rare earth compounds, the heavy fermions (HFs), which can be tuned\nto a quantum critical point (QCP), separating a magnetic\nground state from a paramagnetic one [1], by varying an\nexternal parameter such as pressure or chemical doping.\nIn the quantum critical regime the metallic properties\nare significantly different from what one expects from a\nstandard Landau Fermi liquid (LFL), and therefore these\nsystems are prototypes to study how strong correlation\neffects give rise to deviations from LFL.\nThe early theoretical attempts to describe the QCP\nare based on the possibility that the instability of the\nparamagnetic phase is due to spin density wave (SDW)\nformation [2], and the critical fluctuations are the paramagnons. However, in three dimensions these theories\nfail to explain simultaneously the linear temperature (T )\ndependence of the resistivity and the log T dependence of\nthe specific heat coefficient observed in experiments [3].\nThis has stimulated theorists to construct alternative descriptions of the quantum criticality [4], among which\nthe scenario of Kondo breakdown (KB) has proven to be\npromising [5, 6]. In the KB scenario the non-LFL behaviour is due to the presence of a second QCP, in close\nproximity to the magnetic one, where the effective Kondo\ntemperature of the lattice (TK ) goes to zero. In this picture the critical fluctuations, non-magnetic in origin, are\nassociated with the hybridization fluctuation between a\nbroad conduction band and a narrow f -electron band.\nIn view of the current interest in KB [5\u20138], it is apt\nto pose the question if a direct experimental signature\nof the KB could distinguish it from other possible routes\nto quantum criticality. The issue is non-trivial partly\ndue to the absence of low-T angle-resolved photoemission\ndata of the HFs, and partly because standard quantities\nsuch as resistivity and specific heat do not measure TK\ndirectly. For example, the violation of the WiedemannFranz (WF) law and the divergence of the Gr\u00fcneisen ratio (GR) at the QCP have been identified as experimental\n\nconsequences of KB [8]. However, a true violation of the\nWF law signifies the absence of electron quasiparticles\nwhich need not necessarily be due to TK \u2192 0 physics.\nAn apparent violation of the WF law near a SDW transition [9] can also take place because of inelastic scattering. Similarly, the divergence of the GR is expected\nfor all kinds of QCPs [10]. Consequently, while KB phenomenon implies the violation of the WF law and the\ndivergence of the GR, the converse does not hold. The\nmain purpose of this work is to point out that finite frequency features in the optical conductivity of the HFs,\nthe so-called mid-infrared peak which arise due to interband optical transitions, can provide a direct and unique\nexperimental signature of the KB phenomenon.\nThe mid-infrared peak in the optical conductivity of\nthe HFs has been well-studied experimentally [11] and\ntheoretically [12] in the case where the system is far from\nany phase instability. The physical origin of the peak\nis readily understood within a two-band picture of the\nKondo effect in a lattice, which describes the formation of\nthe heavy LFL as the hybridization between a conduction\nc-band and a narrow f -band. The inter-band transition\ntakes place between one band with more f -character and\nanother with more c-character, and therefore it involves\nan energy-scale at least of the order of the binding energy\nTK of the composite heavy electrons. Thus the peak\nposition is related to TK , even though the two quantities\nmay not always be proportional, as we show below.\nA crucial aspect of the SDW approach is that the paramagnetic energy scale TK remains finite at the QCP.\nTherefore, for such a transition one does not expect the\nmid-infrared peak position and the peak height to change\nsignificantly while the system is tuned to the QCP by\nvarying the external parameter. In contrast, the KB phenomenon is based upon the possibility of a QCP where\nTK \u2192 0. Consequently, a hallmark of KB is a significant\nshift of the inter-band peak position to lower energies,\nas the system is tuned to the QCP. Furthermore, since\nat the KB-QCP the f -band effectively decouples from\n\n\f2\nthe c-band, one expects the inter-band feature to gradually disappear. These qualitative differences can be useful to distinguish experimentally a KB transition from\na SDW instability. This motivates us to study how the\nmid-infrared peak for a heavy LFL varies as the system\napproaches a KB-QCP.\nFrom the perspective of the charge-dynamics of the f electrons, the KB-QCP has been identified as an orbital\nselective Mott transition, where the f -electrons localize and decouple from the metallic environment[13, 14].\nOrbital selective localization is a relevant phenomenon\nin materials with both weakly and strongly correlated\nbands, including classical Mott insulators (like VO2 [15]\nand V2 O3 [16]), ruthenates Ca2\u2212x Srx RuO4 [17], cobaltates, fullerenes and layered organic superconductors (for\na complete list see e.g. Ref. [18]). KB is likely only one of\nthe several possible microscopic mechanisms that leads to\norbital selective Mott transition. However it is interesting to conjecture that, besides the HFs, there are other\ncases where the localization can be described in terms of\na vanishing \"effective Kondo temperature\". We expect\nthat in such systems the study of the optical conductivity\nwill be equally germane.\nModel.- The system we study is described by the\nAnderson-Heisenberg model which is given by\n\u0011\nX f\nX \u0010 \u2020\n\u2020\nni\u03c3\ntc ci\u03c3 cj\u03c3 + tf fi\u03c3\nfj\u03c3 \u2212 E0\nH = \u2212\ni,\u03c3\n\nhiji,\u03c3\n\n\u0011\nX f f\nX\u0010 \u2020\nni\u2191 ni\u2193\nci\u03c3 fi\u03c3 + h.c. + U\n+ V0\ni\n\ni,\u03c3\n\n+ JH\n\nX\nhiji\n\n~f * S\n~f .\nS\ni\nj\n\n(1)\n\nHere tc and tf (tc \u226b tf ) denote hopping of c- and f electrons respectively, (i, j) are lattice sites (which are,\nsay, nearest and next-nearest neighbours), E0 is the local\nenergy level of the f -band, and \u03c3 is the spin index. V0\nis the hybridization between the bands, U is the on-site\nCoulomb repulsion in the f -band (U \u226b tf ), and JH \u223c\n(tf )2 /U is a superexchange spin-spin interaction in the\nf -band. We study the above model in the Kondo limit\nwhere the f -electrons form local moments.\nThe mean field theory is generated by replacing fi\u03c3 \u2192\n\u2020\nb\u2020i Fi\u03c3 , where (b\u2020i , bi ) describe charged holons and (Fi\u03c3\n,\nFi\u03c3 ) describe spin-1/2 spinons. The large Coulomb repulsion is taken into account by projecting outP\nthe double\u2020\nFi\u03c3 +\noccupied f -electron states via the constraint \u03c3 Fi\u03c3\n\u2020\nbi bi = 1 (the associated Lagrange multiplier renormalizes\nE0 ). At the mean field level this model shows a KB quantum phase transition at a critical value xc of the parameter x \u2261 V0 /JH [13]. For x > xc one obtains a heavy LFL\nphase where hbi i =\n6 0 and the f -electrons participate in\nband formation, and for x < xc one obtains a phase with\nhbi i = 0 where the f -electrons localize and form a non\u2020\nmagnetic uniform spin liquid phase (with hFi\u03c3\nFj\u03c3 i 6= 0).\n\nAs the QCP is approached from the LFL side, the lattice\nKondo temperature TK \u2248 \u03c0hbi2 V02 \u03bd0 \u2192 0, where \u03bd0 is\nthe bare density of states of the c-band. We write the\nspinon bandwidth as \u03b1tc \u223c (hbi2 tf + JH ), and consider\n\u03b1 \u226a 1 as a small parameter of the theory.\nWe use linear response theory to study the T = 0\noptical conductivity of the system as it approaches the\nQCP from the LFL side. We ignore the f -band contribution to the current operator and write it as J\u02c6\u03bc \u2248\nP\n\u2020\nk\u03c3 (\u2207k \u01ebk )\u03bc ck\u03c3 ck\u03c3 , where \u01ebk is the bare dispersion of\nthe c-band, and \u03bc denotes spatial direction. This does\nnot change our results at a qualitative level, and can\nbe formally justified as an expansion in tc /tf . Furthermore, we write |\u2207k \u01ebk | \u2248 vF , the Fermi velocity of the cband, and we ignore the vertex corrections to the currentcurrent correlator. The optical conductivity \u03c31 (\u03a9) is the\nreal part of the frequency dependent conductivity tensor,\nwhich can be written as (for \u03a9 \u2265 0, and setting ~ = 1)\n\u03c31 (\u03a9) \u2248\n\n2e2 vF2\n\u03c0\u03a9d\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u2212\u03a9\n\nd\u03c9\n\nX\nk\n\nR\nImGR\nc (\u03c9, k)ImGc (\u03c9 + \u03a9, k),\n\n(2)\nwhere R denotes the retarded function. Within the mean\nfield theory the Green's function for the c-electrons is\n\u22121\nR\nGR\n= \u03c9 \u2212 \u01ebk + i/(2\u03c4c ) \u2212 \u03a3R\nc (\u03c9, k)\nc (\u03c9, k), \u03a3c (\u03c9, k) =\n2\n0\nV /[\u03c9 \u2212 \u01ebk + i/(2\u03c4F )]. V = hbiV0 is the effective hybridization between the c-band and the F -band of the\nspinons, \u01eb0k is the dispersion of the spinons whose bandwidth is \u03b1tc , and \u03c4c and \u03c4F mimic the elastic scattering\ndue to the presence of impurities. In principle, \u03b1tc is V\ndependent, but, for simplicity, we treat it as a constant.\nWe adopt few simplifications in order to perform the\ncalculations analytically: (i) the c-band dispersion is linearized \u01ebk = vF (k \u2212 kF ), where kF is the Fermi wavevector of the c-band; (ii) the mildly dispersive F -band\nis replaced by a flat level \u01eb0k \u2248 \u01eb0kF \u2261 Ex [Fig. 1(a)].\nHere Ex \u2248 \u03b1vF (kF \u2212 kF 0 ), where kF 0 is the Fermi wavevector of the F -band, and kF 0 < kF . The latter approximation is equivalent to ignoring all non-singular \u03b1\ndependence in Eq. (2). The microscopic non-universal\nparameter Ex , which is the energy necessary for a momentum conserving inter-band transition from the Fermi\nsurface of the c-band to the F -band, becomes an important energy-scale in the limit where the effective hybridization V is small (see below). We do not expect our\nresults to depend on the details of the band-dispersions.\nTo demonstrate this explicitly, we also evaluate numerically \u03c31 (\u03a9) in Eq. 2 by taking the continuum limit of the\nmodel. We use parabolic dispersions \u01ebk = (k 2 \u2212kF2 )/(2m)\nand \u01eb0k = (k 2 \u2212 kF2 0 )/(2m0 ), set the energy scale by\n\u01ebF \u2261 kF2 /(2m) = 1, and we choose Ex = \u01ebF /100,\nm/m0 \u2261 \u03b1 = 0.25 We show that at a qualitative level the\nnumerical and approximate analytical results match well\n[Figs. 2, 3], and this validates our physical conclusions.\nResults.- Let us for the moment ignore the finite life-\n\n\f3\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n\u03a9c\n\nkF0\n\nEx\n\n100 V/\u03b5F\n3\n\n20\nEq.

In both cases, as V is reduced,\nthe peak heights first increase for V \u226b Ex = \u01ebF /100, and\nthen diminish for V . Ex . For clarity the plots are truncated\nto exclude the Drude feature.\n\n2\n2\nImGR\nc (\u03c9, k) = \u2212\u03c0[uk \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 E1k ) + vk \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 E2k )],\n\nwhere u2k = [1 + (Ex \u2212 \u01ebk )/D]/2, D = [(\u01ebk \u2212 Ex )2 +\n4V 2 ]1/2 , vk2 = 1 \u2212 u2k , and E1,2k = [\u01ebk + Ex \u2213 D]/2 are the\ntwo hybridized bands. From Eq. (2) we get (for \u03a9 > 0),\n\u03c31 (\u03a9) \u221d\n\n1\n\u03a9\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nd\u03c9\n\n\u2212\u03a9\n\nX\nk\n\nu2k vk2 \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 E1k )\u03b4(\u03c9 + \u03a9 \u2212 E2k ),\n\nwhich is finite provided (a) \u2212\u03a9 \u2264 E1k \u2264 0, and (b)\n\u03a9 = E2k \u2212 E1k . Thus, any finite frequency feature in\nthe optical conductivity is due to momentum conserving inter-band transitions. We note that, for a given\neffective hybridization V , there is a cut-off frequency\n\u03a9c \u2261 [E2k \u2212 E1k ]min = 2V below which inter-band transitions are not possible. This corresponds to momenta\nwhere the bare bands \u01ebk and \u01eb0k cross [Fig. 1(a)]. For\nthis process u2k vk2 \u2248 1/4 is maximal, and it reduces for\ninter-band transitions with frequencies larger than \u03a9c .\nIn order to include effects of finite lifetime of the celectrons (we find that finite \u03c4F is of secondary importance, and we ignore it in the analytic evaluation), it is\nmore convenient to replace the momentum sum in Eq. (2)\nby an energy integral, which can be performed by the\nmethod of contours for the simplified case of a linearized\nc-band and a non-dispersive F -band. This gives\n\u03a920\nIm\n\u03a9\n\n0\n\nd\u03c9\n,\nA (\u03c9) \u2212 \u03a3R (\u03c9 + \u03a9)\n\u03a9\n+\ni/\u03c4\n+\n\u03a3\nc\n\u2212\u03a9\nc\nc\n(3)\nwhere \u03a920 = ne2 /m, n being the c-electron density. As V\nis reduced we find two different regimes (Figs. 2 and 3).\n\u03c31 (\u03a9) \u2248 \u2212\n\nZ\n\n(i) V > Ex . In this regime \u03a9 = \u03a9c corresponds to\nE1k = Ex \u2212 V < 0, which implies that the threshold\nfrequency for an inter-band transition is \u03a9c [Fig. 1(a)].\nClose to the threshold we get (dot-dashed line in Fig. 2)\n\u001a \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0014\n\u03a92 \u03a92\n\u03a9\n1\n\u03c31 (\u03a9 & \u03a9c ) \u2248 0 2 Im\nln 1 \u2212\n4\u03a9c\n2Z\n\u03a9/2 \u2212 Ex + Z\n\u0013\u001b\u0015\n\u0012\n\u03a9\n,\n\u2212 ln 1 \u2212\n\u03a9/2 \u2212 Ex \u2212 Z\nwhere Z = (\u03a92+ + i/\u03c412 )1/2 , \u03a9+ = \u03a9(\u03a92 \u2212 \u03a92c )1/2 /(2\u03a9c ),\nand 1/\u03c412 = \u03a93 /(4\u03c4c \u03a92c ). The difference in the position of the peak \u03a9p in \u03c31 (\u03a9) and the threshold \u03a9c is\nO(1/(\u03a9c \u03c4c )), and assuming well defined quasiparticles\nwith \u03a9c \u03c4c \u226b 1 we get [ Fig. 1(b) and 3(a)]\n\u03a9p \u2248 \u03a9>\np \u2261 2V.\n\n(4)\n\nThus, in this regime, which\nhas been discussed in the lit\u221a\nerature [11, 12], \u03a9p \u221d TK and the peak position is a direct measure of the lattice Kondo temperature. For V \u226b\nEx , \u03c31 (\u03a9p ) \u221d \u03a920 [\u03c4c /V ]1/2 , which implies that the peak\nvalue increases as V is reduced [Fig. 2 and Fig. 3(b)].\nThis behaviour continues until (\u03c4c /V )1/2 (V \u2212 Ex ) \u223c 1,\nafter which the peak value decreases with decreasing V .\nWe note that, the divergence of \u03c31 (\u03a9p ) for infinitely longlived c-electrons is an artefact of a theory where the effective hybridization is momentum independent. For the\ncase where the momentum dependence of the hybridization is important, we expect \u03c31 (\u03a9p ) \u221d 1/V .\n\n\f4\n\n(a)\n\nEq. (2) (b)\nEq.

The triangles in (a) and the\nsolid line in (b) are obtained using parabolic bands (Eq. 2 with\n\u03b1 = 0.25 and 1/\u03c4c[F ] = 10\u22123 \u01ebF ). The peak position matches\n<\nthe analytical result \u03a9p = \u03a9>\np (\u03a9p ) for V > Ex (V < Ex ) .\nIn (b) the dashed line is obtained using a linearized c-band\nand non-dispersive F -band (Eq. 3).\n\n(ii) V < Ex . This new regime, which has not been\nstudied earlier, is relevant when the system is close to\nthe KB-QCP. We find that \u03a9 = \u03a9c corresponds to\nE1k = Ex \u2212 V > 0, which implies that an inter-band\ntransition at this frequency is not possible at T = 0. The\n2\nthreshold frequency is \u03a9<\np \u2261 V /Ex + Ex > \u03a9c , and this\ncorresponds to an inter-band transition from the Fermi\nsurface of the lower hybridized band [Fig. 1(b)]. In the\nvicinity of the threshold we get\n\u03c31 (\u03a9 & V 2 /Ex + Ex ) \u2248\n\n\u03c0\u03a92\np c\n.\n4\u03a92 \u03a92 \u2212 \u03a92c\n\nAs before, neglecting the finite lifetime, the peak-position\nis at the threshold frequency, and we get [Fig. 3(a)]\n2\n\u03a9p \u2248 \u03a9<\np = V /Ex + Ex .\n\n(5)\n\nThus, \u03a9p is no longer a direct measure of TK , and in particular it stays finite (\u03a9p \u2192 Ex as TK \u2192 0) at the QCP.\nAlso, in this regime \u03a9p varies little with V , which may not\nbe discernible whenever \u03a9p cannot be very well-resolved.\nSince \u03a9p 6= \u03a9c , the corresponding matrix element u2k vk2\ndecreases from the maximal value 1/4 as V is reduced.\nAs a result the peak-value \u03c31 (\u03a9p ) decreases rapidly [Fig.\n2 and Fig. 3(b)], and the peak vanishes at the QCP indicating the gradual decoupling of the f -band from the\nc-band. Note that if 1/\u03c4c \u226b Ex , the inter-band feature\nis eventually masked by the Drude peak.\nNext we discuss the limitations of our results. These\nare based on model calculations and mean field considerations giving more prominent inter-band feature than\nthose observed experimentally. Furthermore, the fluctuations are non-negligible near the QCP, and the crucial\nquestion is whether this only smears the feature further\nor washes it out entirely. The issue requires further investigation that is beyond the scope of the current paper.\n\nHowever, even if the feature is washed out very near the\nQCP, any observation of significant shift of the peak position towards lower energy will have demonstrated that\nthe physics of these systems is richer than what can be\ncaptured by SDW theory.\nConclusion.- We studied the finite-frequency interband transition peak in the optical conductivity of a\nheavy fermion system near a Kondo breakdown type of\nquantum critical point, where the lattice Kondo temperature vanishes. As the system approaches the QCP from\nthe heavy Fermi liquid side, we find a new cross-over\nregime where the peak position is related to, but is no\nlonger a direct measure of the lattice Kondo scale. In\nparticular, the peak position moves to lower energies, but\nremains finite at the QCP. On the other hand, the peak\nvalue changes non-monotonically as TK \u2192 0, and eventually the peak disappears at the QCP indicating the\ndecoupling of the f -electrons from the conduction band.\nThese features are fingerprints of a Kondo breakdown\ntype of QCP, and therefore can be used to distinguish it\nexperimentally from a spin density wave type of QCP.\n\n[1] G.
