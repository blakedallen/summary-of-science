Introduction\nAs it is well-known [1], [2] Unruh radiation represents a general quantum phenomena\ncharacteristic for all locally constantly accelerated systems (not only for the black-holes\n[3],[4]) on the one hand, and, on the other hand, according to the general relativistic\nequivalence principle there is no any difference between local acceleration and\ngravitational phenomena. However, deduction of the Unruh temperature (as well as\nHawking black hole temperature and entropy [2],[3],[4],[5]) even in a simple way [1] is\n\n\fmostly not so simple that it can be understand \"without knowing the details of quantum\ngravity\", we paraphrase Fursaev [5].\nIn this work we shall suggest a sufficiently simple for understanding \"without\nknowing the details of the quantum gravity\" and quite correct deduction of the Unruh\ntemperature (but not whole Unruh radiation process!). Firstly, we shall directly apply\nusual consequences of the Unruh radiation and temperature at surface gravity of a large\nspherical physical system and we shall show that corresponding thermal energy can be\nformally quite correctly presented as the potential energy absolute value of the classical\ngravitational interaction between this large and a small quantum system with welldefined characteristics. Secondly, we shall inversely \"postulate\" small quantum system\nwith necessary well-defined characteristics and then, after \"supposition\" on the\nequivalence between potential energy absolute value of its gravitational interaction with\nlarge system with thermal energy, we shall obtain exact value of the Unruh temperature.\nMoreover, by very simple and correct application of suggested formalism (with small\nquantum system) at thermodynamic laws, we shall successfully study other\nthermodynamic characteristics, especially entropy, characteristic for Unruh and Hawking\nradiation.\n2. Inverse deduction of the Unruh temperature\nConsider a classical, large, spherical physical system with mass M, characteristic\nradius R and surface gravity, i.e. normal acceleration\n(1)\na=GM/R2\nwhere G represents the Newtonian gravitational constant.\nThis acceleration quite generally corresponds to the Unruh temperature obtained at the\nwell-known way [1], [2]\n(2) T = 1/k \u045b/(2\u03c0c) a = 1/k \u045b/(2\u03c0c) (GM/R2)\nor Unruh thermal energy.\n(3) kT = \u045b/(2\u03c0c) a = \u045b/(2\u03c0c) (GM/R2)\nwhere k represents the Boltzmann constant, \u045b - reduced Planck constant and c \u2013 speed of\nlight.\nLast expression can be simply formally transformed in\n(4) kT = G [\u045b/(2\u03c0cR)] M/R = GmM/R\n.\nwhere\n(5)\nm = \u045b/(2\u03c0cR)\n.\nFor\n(6) m << M\nor, according to (5), for\n(7) 2\u03c0R = \u045b/(mc) >> \u045b/(Mc)\nm can be formally quantum theoretically interpreted as the mass of a small quantum\nsystem whose reduced Compton wavelength corresponds to the circumference of any\ngreat circle on the sphere corresponding to large system. But roughly classically small\nquantum system can be considered as a material point at the large system surface so that\nfinal right hand of (4) can be formally interpreted as the absolute value of the classical\npotential energy of gravitational interaction between large and small system\n(8)\nV= -GmM/R .\n.\n\n\fNow we shall suggest a very simple, formal, inverse deduction of the Unruh\ntemperature (2).\nFirstly, suppose formally that at the large system surface there is a quantum system\nwith strictly defined mass by (5), so that this quantum system is small in sense of (6) or\n(7).\nSecondly, suppose formally that usual gravitational interaction between small\nquantum system and large quantum system has such absolute value of the potential\nenergy (8) that it is equivalent to some thermal energy (4).\nThen, temperature corresponding to this thermal energy is formally identical to the\nUnruh temperature.\nIn further parts of this work we shall prove that suggested simple method for formal\ndeduction of the Unruh temperature is not trivial.\n3. Inversely defined Unruh temperature and entropy\nUnruh radiation must satisfy thermodynamic law that, according to (2), implies\n(9)\ndS = 1/T d(Mc2) = k 2\u03c0 [c3 /(\u045bG) ]R2 dM/M = k 2\u03c0 R2/ L2P dM/M\nwhere S represents the entropy of the large system and LP = [\u045bG/c3]1/2 - the Planck length.\nExact differential form of (9) can be approximately presented as the following finite\ndifference form\n(10)\n\u0394S = k 2\u03c0 R2/ L2P \u0394M/M = k 2\u03c0 R2/ L2P n m/M\n.\nfor \u0394M = nm for n=1, 2. ... . It, according to (5), turns out in\n(11) \u0394S = n k Rc2/(MG) for n=1. 2. ...\n.\nConcrete forms of (9) and (11) depend of the concrete functional dependence between\nR and M.\nSuppose a linear functional dependence between R and M, i.e.\n(12) R = \u03b1 M\nfor a constant parameter \u03b1 with low value limit 2G/c2 corresponding to the Schwarzschild\nblack hole, i.e.\n(13) \u03b1 \u2265 2G/c2\n.\nExpression (12) introduced in (9) implies\n(14)\ndS = k 2\u03c0 \u03b12 / L2P MdM = k \u03c0 / L2P d(\u03b12M2 ) = k \u03c0 / L2P d(R2) = d(k \u03c0 R2/ L2P)\nor, after integration,\n(15)\nS = k \u03c0 R2/ L2P) = k 4\u03c0 R2/ (4L2P) = kA/(4L2P)\nwhere A=4\u03c0 R2 represents the large system surface area. As it is not hard to see\nexpression (15) is formally identical to the remarkable Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of\nthe Schwarzschild black hole for horizon surface A even in case when is greater than \u03b1\nlow value limit 2G/c2. It represents an interesting fact.\nExpression (12) introduced in (11) implies\n(16) \u0394S = n k \u03b1 c2/G\nfor n=1. 2. ...\n.\nAs it is not hard to see only for \u03b1 low value limit 2G/c2 this expression becomes formally\nidentical to the remarkable Bekenstein quantization of the Schwarzschild black hole\nentropy\n(17) \u0394S = n (2k)\nfor n=1. 2. ...\n.\nIn all other, non-limit situations we obtain larger entropy difference than for\nSchwarzschild black hole. For this reason we can consider (16) as a generalized, \u03b1 value\n\n\fdependent, Bekenstein quantization of the entropy characteristic for the linear\ndependence between R and M.\nFurther, expression (12) introduced in (2), implies\n(18) T = 1/k \u045bG/(2\u03c0c) (1/M) 1/ \u03b1 2\n.\nAs it is not hard to see only for \u03b1 low value limit 2G/c2 this expression becomes formally\nidentical to the remarkable Hawking temperature of the Schwarzschild black hole entropy\n(19) T = 1/k \u045bc3/(8\u03c0G) (1/M)\n.\nIn all other, non-limit situations we obtain smaller temperature than Hawking\nSchwarzschild black hole temperature.\nSuppose now that large system holds constant mass density which implies the\nfollowing functional dependence between R and M\n(20) R = \u03b1 M1/3\nfor a constant parameter \u03b1.. For example, such situation appears by FRW universe filled\ndominantly with vacuum (dark) energy.\nExpression (20) introduced in (9) implies\n(21)\ndS = k 2\u03c0 \u03b12 / L2P M-1/3dM = k 3\u03c0 / L2P d(\u03b12M2/3 ) = k 3\u03c0 / L2P d(R2)\nor, after integration,\n(22)\nS = k 3\u03c0 R2/ L2P) = k 3(4\u03c0 R2)/(4L2P) = k3A/(4L2P)\n.\nAs it is not hard to see expression (22) is formally three times larger than the remarkable\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy of the Schwarzschild black hole with the same horizon\nsurface for arbitrary \u03b1.\nExpression (20) introduced in (11) implies\n(23)\n\u0394S = n k \u03b1 M-2/3c2/G = n k \u03b13 R-2c2/G for n=1. 2. ...\n.\nObviously this expression is dependent not only of the parameter \u03b1 but of M or R too.\n. Further, expression (20) introduced in (2), implies\n(24)\nT = 1/k \u045bG/(2\u03c0c) M2/3 1/\u03b1 = 1/k \u045bG/(2\u03c0c) R2 1/\u03b13\n.\nObviously this expression is dependent not only of the parameter \u03b1 but of M or R too.\nMoreover, when M or R increases then according to (24) T and kT increase too. All this\ncan be very interesting for cosmological problems (whose considerations go over basic\nintention of this work).\n4. Conclusion\nIn conclusion we can shortly repeat and point out the following. In this work we\nsuggest a sufficiently simple for understanding \"without knowing the details of the\nquantum gravity\" and quite correct deduction of the Unruh temperature (but not whole\nUnruh radiation process!). Firstly, we shall directly apply usual consequences of the\nUnruh radiation and temperature at surface gravity of a large spherical physical system\nand we shall show that corresponding thermal energy can be formally quite correctly\npresented as the potential energy absolute value of the classical gravitational interaction\nbetween this large and a small quantum system with well-defined characteristics.\nSecondly, we shall inversely \"postulate\" small quantum system with necessary welldefined characteristics and then, after \"supposition\" on the equivalence between potential\nenergy absolute value of its gravitational interaction with large system with thermal\nenergy, we shall obtain exact value of the Unruh temperature.\n\n\fMoreover, by very simple and correct application of suggested formalism (with small\nquantum system) at thermodynamic laws, we shall successfully study other\nthermodynamic characteristics, especially entropy, characteristic for Unruh and Hawking\nradiation.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] P.
