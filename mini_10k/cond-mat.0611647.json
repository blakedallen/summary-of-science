These high spatial resolution optical techniques has been used to measure the photoluminescence (PL) from single quantum dots and study the\nexchange interaction between a zero-dimensional exciton\nand a few1,2 or a single magnetic ion embedded in the\nquantum dots (QD)3,4,5,6,7 . Theoretically, the ground\nstate energy spectrum of a quantum dot containing a\nMn ion was studied in Refs. 8,9,10.\nIn this work we have theoretically and experimentally\nstudied the fine structure of excited excitonic states in\nsuch magnetically-doped QDs. We have developed a theory taking into account both direct Coulomb and longrange exchange interaction between an electron and a\nhole in the zero-dimensional exciton and exchange interaction of the coupled electron-hole pair with the Mn\nd-electrons. The fine structure of the excited state is\nshown to be determined by an interplay of the anisotropic\nelectron-hole long-range exchange interaction, Coulomb\ninteraction between the charge carriers and the coupling\nof an exciton with a Mn ion.\nThe developed theory is compared with the PL excitation (PLE) measurements on an individual QD carrying\na Mn2+ ion. The coupling constants of exciton-Mn interaction for the ground and optically active excited states\nare determined. The analysis of the fine structure of the\nexcited states allows us to determine the degree of QD\nanisotropy and make conclusions about the magnetic ion\nposition in a quantum dot.\n\nThe paper is organized in a following way: Sec. II is\ndevoted to the theoretical analysis of the fine structure of\npp-shell excitonic states in the QD without a Mn ion, Sec.\nIII presents the results on the exciton interaction with\nthe magnetic ion, and Sec. IV presents the experimental\nresults and their analysis.\nII.\n\nEXCITON STATES IN NON-MAGNETIC\nDOTS\n\nWe consider heavy-hole exciton states in a single\nquantum-well quantum dot. This means that we neglect heavy-light hole mixing and assume an exciton to\nbe formed by a conduction-band electron with the spin\ns = \u00b11/2 and a heavy hole with the spin (or angularmomentum component) j = \u00b13/2.6 For the in-plane confinement of free carriers, we choose coaxial parabolic potentials with z as the principal axis. In what follows we\nconcentrate on QDs of sizes small enough to have the inplane localization lengths for electrons (ae ) or holes (ah )\nsmaller than the two-dimensional (2D) exciton Bohr radius aB .\nTo begin with, let us consider an axially (cylindrically)\nsymmetric QD where the exciton ground state (ss-shell)\nis described by the envelope\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n\u03c12\n\u03c12\nS(\u03c1e , \u03c1h ) =\n(1)\nexp \u2212 e2 \u2212 h2 ,\n\u03c0ae ah\n2ae\n2ah\nwhere \u03c1e,h is the electron or hole in-plane radius vector\nwith the components xe , ye or xh , yh referred to the center of the confining potential. Similarly, the pp-orbital\nexcited states being the products of electron and hole\nPx,y orbitals have the form\n\nDxx (\u03c1e , \u03c1h ) = 2\n\nxe xh\nye yh\nS(\u03c1e , \u03c1h ) , Dyy (\u03c1e , \u03c1h ) = 2\nS(\u03c1e , \u03c1h ) ,\nae ah\nae ah\n\nDxy (\u03c1e , \u03c1h ) = 2\n\nxe yh\nye xh\nS(\u03c1e , \u03c1h ) , Dyx (\u03c1e , \u03c1h ) = 2\nS(\u03c1e , \u03c1h ) ,\nae ah\nae ah\n\n(2)\n\n\f2\nwhere the subscripts in Dxx , Dyy , Dxy , and Dyx describe\nthe symmetry of the P -orbitals for an electron and a hole.\nIn the isotropic parabolic potential the four pp-shell\nstates are degenerate. The Coulomb interaction between\nan electron and a hole lifts this degeneracy, see Fig. 1a.\nThe lowest lying state with the wavefunction\n1\n|1i = \u221a [Dxx (\u03c1e , \u03c1h ) + Dyy (\u03c1e , \u03c1h )]\n2\n\n(3)\n\nis optically \u221a\nactive. The states |2i = [Dxx (\u03c1e , \u03c1h ) \u2212\nDyy (\u03c1e , \u03c1h )] \u221a\n2 and |3i\n=\n[Dxy (\u03c1e , \u03c1h ) +\nDyx (\u03c1e , \u03c1h )]/ 2 are degenerate and they are shifted\nabove the state |1i by the energy\n\u221a\n3 \u03c0\n\u03b62\ne2\nVC =\n,\n(4)\n4 (1 + \u03b6 2 )5/2 \u03ba0 ae\nwhere \u03ba0 is the low-frequency dielectric constant and\n\u03b6 = ah /ae . The splitting between the pair of states\n|2i, |3i and \u221a\nthe highest state |4i = [Dxy (\u03c1e , \u03c1h ) \u2212\nDyx (\u03c1e , \u03c1h )]/ 2 is given by VC as well. The binding\nenergy of the exciton |1i referred to the unperturbed position of pp-orbitals reads\n\u221a 4\n\u03c0 \u03b6 + 5\u03b6 2 + 1 e2\nEb =\n.\n(5)\n2 (1 + \u03b6 2 )5/2 \u03ba0 ae\nThe parameters Eb and VC completely determine the direct Coulomb interaction in the parabolic QD.\nWe next turn to the slightly elliptical QD where the\neffective localization radii ae and ah are replaced by localization lengths ae, i , ah, i (i = x, y) in the x and y directions. The anisotropy is characterized by the ratios\n\u03b2e =\n\nae, y \u2212 ae, x\nah, y \u2212 ah, x\n, \u03b2h =\n.\n2ae\n2ah\n\nFor simplicity we assume \u03b2e = \u03b2h \u2261 \u03b2 and \u03b2 \u226a 1. The\nanisotropy fully lifts the degeneracy of pp-orbital states.\nIn the case of large anisotropy (the criterion is given below) the splitting between two bright states Dxx (\u03c1e , \u03c1h )\nand Dyy (\u03c1e , \u03c1h ) is given (to the lowest order in \u03b2) by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c3\n4~2 \u03b2\nEa = Exx \u2212 Eyy = 1 + 2\n,\n(6)\n\u03b6\nme a2e\nwhere \u03c3 = me /mh characterizes electron-hole mass ratio.\nThe splitting between the dark states, Dxy (\u03c1e , \u03c1h ) and\nDyx (\u03c1e , \u03c1h ), arises due to the difference between carrier\nmasses and/or localization radii, namely,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n4~2 \u03b2\n\u03c3\n\u2032\n.\n(7)\nEa = Exy \u2212 Eyx = 1 \u2212 2\n\u03b6\nme a2e\n\nwhere n (or n\u2032 ) is the exciton-state index including both\nthe angular-momentum component m (or m\u2032 ) and orbital\nstate, \u03ba\u221e is the high-frequency dielectric constant, K is\nthe two-dimensional center of mass wave vector with the\ncomponents Kx , Ky , K\u00b11 = Kx \u00b1iKy , m0 is the free electron mass, Eg is the band gap, p0 is the interband matrix\nelement of the momentum operator,\nR and we introduced\ne\nthe 2D Fourier-transform \u03c8(K)\n= d\u03c1 e\u2212iK\u03c1 \u03a8(\u03c1, \u03c1) of\nthe exciton envelope function \u03a8(\u03c1e , \u03c1h ) taken at the coinciding coordinates, \u03c1e = \u03c1h \u2261 \u03c1. For the ss-shell,\n\u03a8n (\u03c1, \u03c1) = S(\u03c1, \u03c1) and, for the pp-shell states |D\u03b1\u03b2 , mi,\n\u03a8n (\u03c1, \u03c1) = D\u03b1\u03b2 (\u03c1, \u03c1) with \u03b1 and \u03b2 running through x, y.\nIn the isotropic QD the ss-shell radiative doublet is not\nsplit by the interaction long-range interaction Eq.

Thus, E \u226a VC and the exchange\ninteraction should be considered as a correction to the\ndirect Coulomb interaction.18 Therefore, in an axial QD\nthe exchange-induced splitting of the radiative pp-orbital\ndoublet is proportional to E 2 /VC and can be neglected.\nIf the QD possesses an anisotropy in the axes x, y the\nradiative doublet of the ground state (1) is split into a\npair of linearly polarized sublevels with the microscopic\ndipole momentum parallel to x and y. This anisotropic\nsplitting is given by\n\u03b4Es = 24\u03b2E ,\n\n(10)\n\nand is proportional to the anisotropy degree \u03b2 entering\nalso into Eqs. (6), (7).

The energy splittings are shown not\nto scale.\n\nwhere r0 is the Mn ion position, Ae and Ah are the coupling parameters for conduction and valence band electrons.13 In derivation of Eq. (12) we took into account\nonly j = \u00b13/2 hole states and neglected the interaction\nwith the electron in-plane spin since, for the realistic set\nof parameters, Ae < Ah /2, see Refs. 3,10.\nIn a QD with an embedded Mn ion, fine structure of\nthe ground-state exciton is determined by the interplay\nbetween the QD anisotropy and the exchange coupling\nwith the Mn ion. From now on we consider the most important (from both experimental and theoretical points\nof view) case where the ground state anisotropic splitting Eq. (10) is negligible as compared with the coupling with a magnetic ion. Without the exciton-ion exchange interaction, the ground state of the system \"exciton + Mn ion\" is 4\u00d76-fold degenerate. The interaction\nHMn splits this state into 12 doubly-degenerate sublevels\nhalf of which, namely, those with the exciton angularmomentum component m \u2261 s + j = \u00b11, are optically\nactive (or bright). Their energies are given by\n(S)\nEm,M\n\nwhere\nIe(s)\n\n=\n\n(S)\nE0\n\n(S)\nE0\n\n+ \u03b4s mM , \u03b4s =\n\n(s)\n(3Ih\n\n\u2212\n\nIe(s) )/2\n\n,\n\n(13)\n\nAe \u2212\u03c120 /a2e 2\nAh \u2212\u03c120 /a2h 2\n(s)\n=\n\u03c6e1 (z0 ) , Ih =\ne\n\u03c6hh1 (z0 ) ,\ne\n2\n\u03c0ae\n\u03c0a2h\n\n\u03c120 = x20 + y02 ; x0 , y0 and z0 are the Cartesian components\nof r0 and the envelope \u03c6e1 (z) or \u03c6hh1 (z) describes the\nelectron or hole confinement along z.\nThe fine structure of the pp-shell exciton excited states\nis determined by a combined effect of the exciton-Mn and\nthe electron-hole (long-range) exchange interactions. If\nthe QD anisotropy is small so that |Ea | \u226a VC the only\none bright state |1i defined by Eq. (3) splits into 6 doublydegenerate sublevels, see Fig. 1a,\n(D)\n\n(14)\n\nwhere E1 is the energy of |1i state,\n\u03b4d =\n\n\u0001\n1\n(d)\n3Ih \u2212 Ie(d) ,\n2\n\nIe(d) =\n\nr2 (s)\nr02 (s)\n(d)\nIe , Ih = 02 Ih ,\n2\nae\nah\n\n(15)\n\n(16)\n\nare strongly sensitive to the position of the Mn ion. For\nexample, if the Mn ion is located exactly in the QD center\nthe splitting of pp-shell states vanishes.\nIn highly anisotropic QDs where VC \u226a Ea the fine\nstructure of the Dxx and Dyy levels is even more rich.\nIn general case an overlap between exciton and Mn ion\nis different for these two orbitals and one needs to introduce two coupling constants for each type of the carriers,\nnamely,\nIe(xx) =\n\nx20 (s)\nx20 (s)\n(xx)\nI\n,\nI\n=\nI ,\ne\nh\na2e\na2h h\n\nIe(yy) =\n\ny02 (s)\ny 2 (s)\n(yy)\nIe , Ih = 02 Ih .\n2\nae\nah\n\n(17)\n\nThe eigen energies are determined by the interplay of the\nexciton-Mn interaction described by the parameter\n(ii)\n\n\u03b4ii = 3Ih\n\nis the ss-shell exciton energy,\n\nEm,M = E1 + \u03b4d mM ,\n\nand the coupling constants\n\n\u2212 Ie(ii)\n\n(i = x, y) ,\n\n(18)\n\nand the long-range exchange splitting Eq.

For Ed 6= 0, the levels are nonequidistant\nand the crossover between anisotropy dominated regime\nwith two linearly polarized states (\u03b4Ed \u226b \u03b4ii ) and the\nregime of dominant exciton-Mn interaction (\u03b4Ed \u226a \u03b4ii )\nwith six equidistant sublevels takes place.\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION AND COMPARISON WITH\nAN EXPERIMENT\n\nWe use micro-spectroscopy to analyze the optical properties of individual Mn-doped self-assembled CdTe/ZnTe\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Experimental PL and PLE spectra of\nMn-doped quantum dot exciton. The spectral features related\nto the ground and excited states are marked correspondingly.\nThe inset shows the contour plot of the multi-channel PLE.\n\nQDs. Single Mn atoms are introduced in CdTe/ZnTe\nQDs3,4,5 by adjusting, during the growth process, the\ndensity of Mn atoms to be roughly equal to the density\nof QDs.14 The PL of individual QDs is excited with a tunable dye laser and collected through aluminium shadow\nmasks with 0.2 . . . 1.0 \u03bcm apertures. The PL is then\ndispersed by a 2-m additive double monochromator and\ndetected by a nitrogen cooled Si charge-coupled device\n(CCD).\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) PLE contour plots for excited states\nDxx (upper panel) and Dyy (lower panels) obtained for copolarized (left panels) and cross-polarized (right panels) circular excitation.\n\nThe experimental findings for a Mn-doped QD are\n\nFIG. 4: Calculated PLE spectra in co-polarized (left) and\ncross-polarized (right) configuration. The parameters used\nare as follows: Eyy = 2117.86 meV, Exx = 2120.30 meV,\n\u03b4Ed = 0.05 meV, \u03b4\u0303xx = 0.01 meV, \u03b4\u0303yy = 0.04 meV,\n(S)\n= 2086.5 meV. The lines are\n\u03b4s = 0.2 meV and E0\nLorentzian-broadened with the widths \u0393s = 0.03 meV and\n\u0393xx = 0.06 meV, \u0393yy = 0.03 meV.\n\nsummarized in Figs. 2, 3, and 5. This particular QD\nshows clear linearly polarized excited states. The analysis of the fine structure of other QDs presenting linearly\npolarized excited states leads qualitatively to the same\nconclusions. We also note that some QDs demonstrating the excited states in the same energy range present\na very weak or non-detectable linear polarization splitting. Fig. 2 shows PL and PLE spectra of this QD.\nThe ground state PL demonstrates 6 equidistant lines\npositioned at \u223c 2086 meV. These lines correspond to\ndifferent projections of Mn spin (see Eq. (13)). Their\napproximately equal intensities and regular energy spacing evidence the negligible anisotropic splitting of the\nground state. The splitting between these lines suggests\nthe value \u03b4s \u2248 0.2 meV being in a good agreement with\nprevious studies.3\nThe first absorption lines in the measured PLE (Fig. 2)\nlie by \u223c 25 meV above the ground state. This energy range corresponds to the LO-phonon energy between\nCdTe and ZnTe, thus this feature can be identified with\nthe phonon replica of the ground state. The non-trivial\nPLE pattern coming from the replica is a consequence of\ncomplicated phonon spectra in such QDs system.\nNow we proceed with the discussion of the excitedstates fine structure. Two excited states with energies\n\u2248 2117.86 meV and 2120.30 meV are seen in Fig. 2. We\nrelate them with the Dyy - and Dxx -orbital states. The\ndifference in their intensities can be attributed to (i) the\nshorter lifetime of the highest energy state and (ii) the\nCoulomb interaction which, according to Eqs. (3) and\n(4), intermixes the Dxx and Dyy states. The latter effect\nreduces the oscillator strength of the higher state and, as\n\n\f5\na result, the anisotropic exchange splitting of this state.\nA value of the ratio between the energy separation of\nthe excited states Dxx and Dyy and the distance between\nground and excited states allows one to estimate from\nEq. (6) the quantum dot anisotropy degree \u03b2 to be \u2248\n0.02 which supports the assumption that the anisotropic\nsplitting of ss-shell state is not observed. Figure 2 clearly\nmanifests the splitting of Dyy state into a pair of lines.\nWe assume this splitting to come from the QD anisotropy\n[see Eq. (11)]. The splitting of Dxx state is not observed\nfor the reasons suggested above.\nThe comparison between the experimental data and\ntheoretical predictions in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively,\nshows that the best possible agreement of the data is\nobtained for anisotropic splitting \u03b4Ed = 0.05 meV and\n\u03b4\u0303yy = 0.04 meV. The order of magnitude of \u03b4Ed is\nconsistent with the quantum dot size ae = 45 \u00c5 and\nah = 90 \u00c5 (i.e. \u03b6 = 2). It agrees with other results\nfor II-VI QDs where the hole confinement is weaker than\nthat of electrons.15 For these parameters the predicted\nenergy separation between the ground and excited states\nis 43 meV which is somewhat larger than the experimentally observed 33 meV.\nFully quantitative description of the experimental results would require a more complicated theory taking into\naccount all details of the band structure and confinement\npotential as well as the short-range contribution to the\nexchange interaction.16,17\n\ntime of the exciton: no significant relaxation occurs dur-\n\nFIG. 6: Calculated PLE spectra for linearly polarized excitation and unpolarized detection. Left and right panels correspond to two orthogonal linear polarizations. The parameters\nused in the calculation are given in the caption of Fig. 4\n\ning the exciton lifetime. As shown in Figs. 3 and 5, this\nlong spin relaxation time combined with the fine structure of the excited states permits to create selectively a\ngiven spin configuration of the exciton-Mn complex by\ntuning the polarization and wavelength of the excitation\nlaser.\nLet us note finally that the experimentally observed\nPLE intensity distribution for the higher energy state\nDxx is almost uniform, therefore we conclude that the\nexciton-Mn ion coupling is smaller for this state as compared to Dyy . We can thus conclude that the Mn ion\nis located nearby the y axis. If we completely neglect\nelectron-Mn interaction, using Eq. (18) and the fitted\nvalue \u03b4\u0303yy = 0.04 meV we deduce that the Mn-ion is positioned at y0 \u2248 0.3ah , x0 \u226a y0 .\nV.\n\nFIG. 5: (Color online) PLE spectra of Dyy states for linearly\npolarized excitation and unpolarized detection. Left and right\npanels correspond to two orthogonal linearly polarized excitations.\n\nIn order to have a deeper insight into the fine structure of the Dyy state we have performed the PLE measurements for the linearly polarized excitation and unpolarized detection. The experimental results are given in\nFig. 5. The theoretical PLE plots calculated for the same\nparameters as the spectra for circularly-polarized excitation are shown in Fig. 6. The reasonable agreement between the theory and experiment is seen. We note that\nwe do not introduce any spin relaxation in the calculations. The similarity in the PL intensity distribution\nobtained in the theory and in the experiment shows that\nunder resonant excitation the spin relaxation time of the\nexciton-Mn complex is much more longer than the life-\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn conclusion, we have performed a combined experimental and theoretical study of the fine structure of exciton excited states in the QDs containing a single magnetic ion. We have identified two regimes of uniaxial and\nanisotropic quantum dots where the qualitatively different level arrangement and PLE spectra are predicted.\nThe theoretical results are compared with the experimental data on photoluminescence and photoluminescence\nexcitation for an individual Mn-doped QD. All important experimental observations are reproduced theoretically. The comparison has made possible to determine\nthe Mn-exciton interaction constants, QD anisotropy degree and to estimate the position of the Mn ion in the\nquantum dot.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe work was partially supported by RFBR, \"Dynasty\" foundation \u2013 ICFPM and French ANR contract\nMOMES.\n\n\f6\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n4\n5\n\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\nG.
