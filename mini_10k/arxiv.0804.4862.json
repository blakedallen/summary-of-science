They were discovered in soft X-rays by SXT on Yohkoh (see Shibata et al. (1996) for\na review of the SXT results). Recent Hinode jet observations revealed a higher occurrence\nfrequency than previously believed (Cirtain et al. 2007). The new Hinode observations\nallowed to determine the statistical properties of jets (Savtseva et al. 2007), and to deduce\ntheir line of sight velocities and densities (Ciphor et al. 2007; Culhane et al. 2007 ; Kamio\net al. 2007; Moreno Insertis, Galsgaard & Ugarte-Urra 2008).\nPolar jets are believed to occur when reconnection between small scale, pre-existing\nor emerging, closed magnetic fields and the open large scale magnetic field of the coronal\nholes take place, in the so-called anemone-jets model (e.g. the 2D simulations Yokoyama &\nShibata 1996). These numerical simulations, and the recent 3D one of Moreno Insertis et al.\n(2008) were successful in reproducing several key observational aspects of polar jets such as\ntheir speeds and temperatures and their characteristic inverted Y shape (e.g. Shibata et al.\n1996). However, these simulations could not account for the important observation that a\nfraction of jets seems to exhibit helical structure and untwisting (e.g., Shimojo et al. 1996;\nCanfield et al. 1996 ; Pike & Mason 1998; Wang et al. 1998; Wilhelm, Dammasch & Hassler\n2002; Jiang et al. 2007; Filippov, Golub & Koutchmy 2008).\nA 3D model of polar jets has been recently proposed by Pariat, Antiochos & Devore\n(2008), (hereafter PAD08), with magnetic twist being the jet driver (see also Shibata &\nUchida (1986) for a 2D twist model). Here we give only a brief description of the model and\nits results. In this simulation, a vertically oriented magnetic dipole, embedded below the\nphotosphere, generates a null point in a corona which also contains a uniform-background\nvertical magnetic field. The resulting axisymmetric configuration contains two distinct flux\nsystems: a circular patch of strong closed magnetic flux surrounded by weaker open flux,\nleading to an axissymetric configuration.\nSlow horizontal motions, reaching a maximum of about 1 % of the local Alfv\u00e9n speed at\nthe line-tied photospheric feet of the closed magnetic flux are applied, thereby twisting the\nclosed field. The applied flow field conserves the distibution of the vertical magnetic field Bz\nand thus the axisymmetry, with an almost solid body rotation of the closed flux. Initially,\nthe closed system responds quasi-statically to those boundary motions by slowly growing\nvertically. Eventually a kink-like instability occurs which breaks the intitial symmetry. This\ntriggers reconnection at the null-point and generates a massive jet with a speed at a fraction\nof the local Alfv\u00e9n speed. The fact that reconnection remains dormant for a significant\nammount of time is an attractive element of the PAD08 model, since this allows a significant\nenergy build-up before the generation of a massive and impulsive jet.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nMore importantly the model produces a non-linear torsional wave propagating outwards,\nwhich supplies a continuous energy source for accelerating the jet to large distances. The\nwave is due to the release of most of the twist accumulated in the closed field region. Given\nthat, in the corona, the plasma is frozen-in to the magnetic field, the resulting torsional wave\ncould be traced by a helical structure undergoing untwisting while the jet is lifting off. A\nsignificant amount (\u223c 90 %) of the helicity of the overall configuration is ejected with the\njet. Note finally that more recent simulations with non-axisymmetric configurations (with\nan inclined coronal field) lead to quantitatively the same behavior (Pariat et al. 2008 in\npreparation).\nHowever, we do not know whether helical structures seen in some jet observations are\n'real' or they result from projection effects introduced in single viewpoint observations. And\nwhat about the true kinematic behavior of jets? Up to now, all jet velocity determinations\nwere made from a single viewpoint thereby determining a projected component on the plane\nof the sky only. These important issues can only be addressed by using better constraints\non the geometry of the observed jets. STEREO observations, with their two viewpoints, are\nthus perfectly suited to address these questions. This Letter presents the first stereoscopic\nobservations of polar coronal jets. We determined the 3D kinematic evolution of a wellobserved jet and studied its morphology and more specifically its helical structure, how it\ndiffers in different vantage point and finally compared it with synthetic images from the\nPAD08 model.\n\n2.\n\nObservations and Data Analysis\n\nWe analyzed the observations of a polar jet seen by the 2 STEREO spacecraft (hereafter\nA and B) over a northern polar coronal hole on June 7 2007 around 05:00 UT. The spacecraft\nseparation was \u2248 11.7\u25e6 . We focus here on the images collected by the Extreme Ultraviolet\nImaging Telescope (EUVI) of the SECCHI (Wuelser et al. 2004; Howard et al. 2007) suite\nof instruments (the jet was also observed in the outer corona with the COR1 and COR2\ncoronagraphs). EUVI takes full disk images in EUV channels centered around 171, 195,\n284 and 304 \u00c5 (hereafter 171, 195, 284 and 304). EUVI has \u223c 1.6 arcsec pixels and our\nobservations have a cadence of 2.5, 10 and 20 minutes for 171, 195-304 and 284, respectively.\nThe low-cadence of the 284 data did not allow us to observe the generation of the jet.\nWe processed the images with the secchi prep routine. Then, each synchronized image\npair 1 was co-aligned with the routine scc stereopair. This included scaling of both images\n1\n\nSince there are different light travel times for A and B, EUVI image pairs are taken with a time difference\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nto the same pixel size, shifting to a common center and rolling to a common plane defined\nby the Sun center and the locations of the 2 spacecraft. Comparison of the limb locations\n(routine euvi coalign) and housekeeping data from the SECCHI Guide Telescope lead to\nuncertainties in the co-alignment of image pairs of less than a pixel.\nFigure 1 has synchronized image pairs of the jet in the 171 (see also the movies in the\n171 and 195; video1.mpg and video2.mpg). Figure 1 and the associated movies show that\nthe jet takes place in a configuration which includes two bright points. The western-most\nbright point starts to slowly extend upwards at around 04:30, something that can be better\nseen in the 195. Then, at around 04:55 a brightening takes place at the base of this bright\npoint and its structure starts to rise at a faster rate. Sometime between 05:08 and 05:11 the\nrising structure appears to 'jump' towards the left bright point and a jet, with the typical\ninverted Y is formed. The base of the jet, corresponding to the initial location of the two\nbright points, exhibits an intense brightening.\nThe jet develops an apparent helical structure in the last image pair of Figure 1 which\nappears similar on both spacecraft. However, in the next, almost simultaneous image pairs in\n195, 171 and 304, the situation is markedly different (Figure 2). The body of the jet seems to\nbe viewed face-on in A and edge-on in B and appears to untwist while rising. Therefore, what\nwe observe could be a left-handed double helix for which we see both threads in A whereas we\nsee them apparently crossing in B. These significant differences in the appearance of the jet\nbetween in A and B are also visible in the next image pair in the 171, before the jet merges\nwith the background, as it rapidly expands outwards by seemingly untwisting. Both the\nhelical jet body and its base appear very similar in 171 and 195, while small but noticeable\ndifferences can be seen in the 304. This implies that the jet contains both cool (\u2248 80000 K;\n304) and warm plasmas (\u2248 1-1.5 MK; 171 and 195).\nPrevious single-viewpoint inferences of helical structure in jets were always susceptible\nto line of sight effects which could lead to false conclusions. This is the first time that such\na conclusive observation on the existence of helical structures in jets is made. The wave-like\nmotions we observed could be related to the transverse oscillations detected in some jets\n(Cirtain et al. 2007), spicules (De Pontieu et al. 2007) and prominences (Okamoto et al.\n2007).\nNext we studied the 3D kinematics of the jet. We first visually identified the tie-points\nof the jet-front (i.e. the image pixel coordinates) in synchronized image pairs in 171 and\n195, and repeated this process 10 times for each considered image pair. Triangulation of\nthose locations (routine scc triangulate; see Inhester (2006) for the basics of triangulation\nwhich ensures they correspond to the same time on the Sun, i.e. they are synchronized.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nand stereoscopy) supplied the 3D coordinates (x,y,z) and the heliocentric distance of the jet\nfront as a function of time. We then calculated the averaged radial distance of the jet as a\nfunction of time t, rjet (t), and the corresponding standard deviation (supplying an estimate\nof the error bars) for the 10 tie-point selections for every considered image pair.\nFigure 3 contains rjet (t) (upper panel) and the temporal evolution of radial velocity of\nthe jet (lower panel) determined by numerical derivation of rjet(t) with respect to t. This plot\nprovides the 'true' distance and velocity of the jet as opposed to determinations from a single\nviewpoint which give access to a fraction of those quantities only. As can be seen in Figure\n3 there are 2 phases in the kinematic evolution of the jet: an initial phase (0 . t . 2000 s)\nduring which the jet ascends very slowly at \u2248 10-20 km s\u22121 (note that for this phase we\nused data from the 195 because of the better visibility of the jet in this line) followed by a\nphase of impulsive acceleration (t & 2000 s) when the jet speeds up to & 300 km s\u22121 . Such\ntwo-phase kinematic behavior is characteristic of quasi-statically driven MHD systems which\neventually become instable. The maximum speed of the jet is a substantial fraction of the\nAlfv\u00e9n speed in the corona. The corresponding accelerations, calculated from the second\nderivative of rjet (t) with respect to t, exceeded the solar gravity.\nThe deduced coordinates of the jet allowed us to trace its trajectory in 3D. Figure 4 has\nthe jet trajectory corresponding to the phase of rapid acceleration (i.e. the last 6 points of\nFigure 3). The most striking feature is the abrupt change in the jet plane from point 4 to\npoint 5 of its orbit, before following an almost vertical path in points 5 and 6. This change\nis correlated with the apparent 'jump' of the jet seen in the images and the movies around\n05:08 (4th row of Figure 1), thereby suggesting that a kink-like instability may have taken\nplace.\n\n3.\n\nDiscussion and Conclusions\n\nOur stereoscopic observations present the first conclusive evidence of helical structures\nin polar jets. This lends significant support to the PAD08 model, in which jets are driven\nby magnetic untwisting, and predict the development of a clear helical structure.\nFor a more quantitative comparison between the helical jet structure of our observations\nand the PAD08 simulations we produced synthetic images from the latter. Results from a\njet simulation having a 10\u25e6 inclination of the volume coronal field (relatively to the vertical;\nsee PAD08) were used. We constructed synthetic images by integrating the square of the\nelectron density n from the MHD simulation, along horizontal lines of sight (orthogonal\nto the direction of the jet). This emulates the EUV emission that EUVI records which\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nis proportional to the line of sight integral of n2 . Temperature effects entering into the\ndetermination of EUV intensities, through the temperature-dependent instrumental response\nfunction, were not taken into account. This assumption is likely to be acceptable, because\nthe instrumental temperature response functions are rather narrow, tending to select quite\nisothermal plasmas and we have shown that the jet has similar morphology in 3 different\nEUVI channels (Figure 2). Synthetic images are given in the right column of Figure 5. The\ntwo simultaneous images correspond to two viewpoints separated by 20 degrees, i.e. the\nsecond image was constructed by rotating the simulation box by 20 degrees about the z-axis.\nThe images correspond to a snapshot of the PAD08 simulation, shortly after the helical\nstructure started to develop. We note that while in the top right image of Figure 5 two\nthreads can be seen, the bottom right image shows two crossing threads, very similar to the\nface-on and edge-on views of the jet from A and B in the left column of the same Figure\nrespectively.\nThe field lines of the PAD08 model from the selected snapshot have \u2248 1.1 turns or\nequivalently a twist of 2.2 \u03c0, a value that should approximate the amount of twist present in\nthe observed jet, given the similarity between the synthetic and observed images in Figure 5.\nThis amount of twist is a lower limit on the total twist applied to the observed configuration\nduring the initial slow evolution phase jet since there seems that significant twist is left\nover at the base of the jet. The fact that a wider viewpoint separation has to be applied\nto the simulation results in order to obtain a similar jet morphology with respect to the\nobservations is not surprising. The MHD simulations starts with a relatively high degree of\nsymmetry compared to what may be expected for the 'real' Sun.\nFrom the above comparison we conclude that magnetic twist is a viable candidate for the\ninitiation of polar jets. Moreover the kinematics of the jet, with the slow rise phase, followed\nby a 'jump' and rapid acceleration to a fraction of the Alfv\u00e9n speed are also consistent with\nthe twist model of PAD08. However, similar kinematic behavior results from models that do\nnot invoke twist as their driver (e.g., Yokoyama & Shibata 1996; Moreno Insertis et al. 2008).\nIt seems, therefore, that the jet morphology can be the most sensitive discriminator between\ndifferent initiation mechanisms. We finally note that SXT observations showed that about\n10% of jets exhibit helical structure and untwisting (Shimojo et al. 1996). Whether this\nfraction is a lower limit, due to the relatively low spatial resolution of the SXT observations,\nshould await detailed statistical studies of the higher spatial resolution data from Hinode\nand SECCHI.\nThe SECCHI data used here were produced by an international consortium of the Naval\nResearch Laboratory (USA), Lockheed Martin Solar and Astrophysics Lab (USA), NASA\nGoddard Space Flight Center (USA), Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (UK), University\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nof Birmingham (UK), Max\u2212Planck\u2212Institut for Solar System Research (Germany), Centre Spatiale de Li\u00e8ge (Belgium), Institut d Optique Th\u00e9orique et Applique\u00e9 (France), and\nInstitut dAstrophysique Spatiale (France).
