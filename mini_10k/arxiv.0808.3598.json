Among several models, the so-called renormalizable minimal SO(10) model has been paid a particular attention, where two kinds of Higgs\nmultiplets {10\u2295126} are utilized for the Yukawa couplings with matters 16i (i = generation)\n[1, 2, 3]. A remarkable feature of the model is its high predictivity. Indeed, it fixes all quarklepton mass matrices including heavy right-handed neutrinos. So, it predicts a wide range\nof phenomena in low energy physics as well as new phenomena beyond SM, such as leptonflavor violations, leptogenesis, proton decay etc. The recent reviews of the applications of\nminimal SO(10) to these wide range are given in [4]. However, after KamLAND data [5] was\nreleased, it entered to the precision measurements, and many authors performed new data\nfitting to match up these new data [6, 7].\nOn the other hand, there has been another theoretically important progress in the Higgs\nsector of the SO(10) model. The symmetry breaking pattern of the simple renormalizable\nHiggs superpotential [8] down to the SM was analyzed in detail [9, 10]. This gives the\nvery unambiguous and detailed structures between the GUT and the Standard Model in\nunprecedented ways. However it accommodates conflicts on the gauge coupling unifications\netc. [7].\nIn addition to the issue of the gauge coupling unification and proton decay, the minimal\nSO(10) model potentially suffers from the problem that the gauge coupling blows up around\nthe GUT scale. This is because the model includes many Higgs multiplets of higher dimensional representations. In field theoretical point of view, this fact implies that the GUT\nscale is a cutoff scale of the model, and more fundamental description of the minimal SO(10)\nmodel would exist above the GUT scale.\nNot only to solve these problems but also to give solutions to hitherto unsolved problems\nlike the origin of SUSY breaking mediations, we have considered GUT in five dimensions\n(5D). As a simple realization of such a scenario, the minimal SO(10) model was considered\nin warped extra dimensions [11]. In this scenario, the Anti-de Sitter curvature and the fifth\ndimensional radius were chosen so as to realize the GUT scale as an effective cutoff scale in\n4-dimensional effective theory. This idea has been utilized in an extended model proposed\nin [12], where the so-called type II seesaw mechanism dominates to realize the tiny neutrino\nmasses through the warped geometry. In both models, the SO(10) gauge symmetry was\nconsidered to be broken by Higgs multiplets on branes as usual in 4-dimensional models.\nAnother possibility of constructing GUT models in extra-dimensions is to consider the\nso-called orbifold GUT [13], where the GUT gauge symmetry is (partly) broken by orbifold boundary conditions. A class of SO(10) models in 5D has been proposed [14], where\nSO(10) gauge symmetry is broken into the PS gauge group by orbifold boundary condition\non S 1 /(Z2 \u00d7 Z2\u2032 ) and further symmetry breaking into the SM gauge group is achieved by\nVEVs of Higgs multiplets on a brane. In this context, we have recently proposed a very\nsimple SO(10) model [15]. In this model, all matter and Higgs multiplets reside only on a\nbrane (PS brane) where the PS gauge symmetry is manifest, so that low energy effective\ndescription of this model is nothing but the PS model in 4D with a special set of matter\n1\n\n\fand Higgs multiplets. At energies higher than the compactification scale (Mc ), the KaluzaKlein modes of the bulk SO(10) gauge multiplet are involved in the particle contents and in\nfact, the gauge coupling unification was shown to be successfully realized by incorporating\nthe Kaluza-Klein mode threshold corrections into the gauge coupling running [15]. More\nrecently, it has been shown [16] that this orbifold GUT model is applicable to the smooth\nhybrid inflation [17]. Interestingly, the inflation model can fit the WMAP 5-year data [18]\nvery well by utilizing the PS breaking scale (vP S ) and the gauge coupling unification scale\npredicted independently of cosmological considerations.\nIn any SUSY models, the origin of SUSY breaking and its mediation to the minimal\nSUSY SM (MSSM) sector is an important issue. Since the flavor-dependent soft SUSY\nbreaking terms are severely constrained by the current experiments, a mechanism to transmit SUSY breaking naturally in a flavor-blind way is favorable . From this motivation, the\nSUSY breaking sector on the other brane is examined in Ref. [15]. In this setup, the bulk\ngauginos first obtain masses, and sfermion masses on the PS brane are automatically generated through the renormalization group equation (RGE) from the compactification scale\nto the electroweak scale. Importantly, the sfermion masses generated in this way are flavorblind, because the interaction transmitting the gaugino mass to sfermion masses is the gauge\ninteraction. This scenario is nothing but the gaugino mediation [19].\nUnfortunately, the simple setup taken in Ref. [15] results in the right-handed slepton\n(normally, stau) being the lightest superpartner (LSP) and is disfavored in cosmological\npoint of view. In this paper, we show that the previous conclusion is the result from the\nspecial condition, vP S = Mc , adopted in [15] and if we relax it to be vP S < Mc , bino-like\nneutralino arises as the LSP and so a usual dark matter candidate in SUSY models. We also\nshow that even for the parameter choice, vP S < Mc , the gauge coupling unification is still\nsuccessfully realized.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In the next section we briefly review the setup of our\norbifold SO(10) GUT model. In Sec. 3, we investigate the gauge coupling unification for the\ncase vP S < Mc . In Sec. 4, we examine the gaugino mediation in our model for vP S < Mc\nand investigate sparticle masses, in particular, masses of the right-handed slepton (stau) and\nbino. We will see that bino becomes the LSP when Mc is sufficiently large. The last section\nis devoted for conclusion.\n\n2\n\nModel setup\n\nHere we briefly review the orbifold SO(10) GUT model proposed in Ref. [15]. The model\nis described in 5D and the 5th dimension is compactified on the orbifold S 1 /Z2 \u00d7 Z2\u2032 [13].\nA circle S 1 with radius R is divided by a Z2 orbifold transformation y \u2192 \u2212y (y is the\nfifth dimensional coordinate 0 \u2264 y < 2\u03c0R) and this segment is further divided by a Z2\u2032\ntransformation y \u2032 \u2192 \u2212y \u2032 with y \u2032 = y + \u03c0R/2. There are two inequivalent orbifold fixed\npoints at y = 0 and y = \u03c0R/2. Under this orbifold compactification, a general bulk wave\nfunction is classified with respect to its parities, P = \u00b1 and P \u2032 = \u00b1, under Z2 and Z2\u2032 ,\nrespectively.\n2\n\n\fAssigning the parity (P, P \u2032) to the bulk SO(10) gauge multiplet as listed in Table 1, only\nthe PS gauge multiplet has zero-mode and the bulk 5D N=1 SUSY SO(10) gauge symmetry is\nbroken to 4D N=1 SUSY PS gauge symmetry. Since all vector multiplets has wave functions\non the brane at y = 0, the SO(10) gauge symmetry is respected there, while only the PS\nsymmetry is on the brane at y = \u03c0R/2 (PS brane).\n(P, P \u2032)\n\nbulk field\n\nmass\n\n(+, +)\n\nV (15, 1, 1), V (1, 3, 1), V (1, 1, 3)\n\n2n\nR\n\n(+, \u2212)\n\nV (6, 2, 2)\n\n(2n+1)\nR\n\n(\u2212, +)\n\n\u03a6(6, 2, 2)\n\n(2n+1)\nR\n\n(\u2212, \u2212)\n\n\u03a6(15, 1, 1), \u03a6(1, 3, 1), \u03a6(1, 1, 3)\n\n(2n+2)\nR\n\nTable 1: (P, P \u2032) assignment and masses (n \u2265 0) of fields in the bulk SO(10) gauge multiplet\n(V, \u03a6) under the PS gauge group.

[15], assuming Mc = vP S and imposing the left-right symmetry, the gauge coupling\nunification was examined. We relax this assumption and consider the case vP S < Mc in the\nnext section. However, note that vP S = 1.19 \u00d7 1016 GeV is fixed as the same as in Ref. [15]\nsince the PS scale is determined as the scale where the SU(2)L and SU(2)R gauge couplings\ncoincide with each other. The PS scale in our model is very high relative to other 5D\norbifold SO(10) models [14]. The high value of vP S is advantageous for dangerous proton\ndecay due to dimension six operators. From Eq. (2), the right-handed neutrino mass scale\nis given by MR \u223c YR vP2 S /M5 . For M5 \u223c 1017 GeV (which can be estimated from the\nparameters obtained in the next section), the scale MR = O(1014 GeV) preferable for the\nseesaw mechanism can be obtained by a mild tuning of the Yukawa coupling YR \u223c 0.1.\n\n3\n\nGauge coupling unification\n\nIn the orbifold GUT model, we assume that a more fundamental extra-dimensional GUT\ntheory takes place at some high energy beyond the compactification scale. For the theoretical\nconsistency of the model, the gauge coupling unification should be realized at some scale after\ntaking into account the contributions of Kaluza-Klein modes of the bulk gauge multiplet to\nthe gauge coupling running [20].\nIn our setup, we take vP S < Mc and the evolution of gauge couplings has three stages,\nG321 (SM+MSSM), G422 (the PS stage) and the PS stage with the Kaluza-Klein mode\ncontributions. Since we have imposed the left-right symmetry, the SU(2)L and SU(2)R\ngauge couplings must coincide with each other at the scale \u03bc = vP S . As a consequence, the\nPS scale is fixed from the gauge coupling running in the MSSM stage.\nIn the G321 stage, we have\n\u0012 \u0013\n1\n1\nbi\nM\n; (i = 3, 2.1),\n(7)\n=\n+\nln\n\u03b1i (\u03bc)\n\u03b1i (M) 2\u03c0\n\u03bc\nwhere M = MZ , and bi s are\nb3 = \u22127, b2 = \u221219/6, b1 = 41/10\n\n(8)\n\nfor MZ \u2264 \u03bc \u2264 MSUSY .

The PS symmetry breaking scale, vP S , is determined from the gauge coupling running in the MSSM stage\n6\n\n\f\u22121\nby imposing the matching condition, \u03b12\u22121 (vP S ) = \u03b12R\n(vP S ) = (5\u03b11\u22121(vP S ) \u2212 2\u03b13\u22121 (vP S ))/3,\nand we find\n\nvP S = 1.19 \u00d7 1016 GeV,\n\n(15)\n\nfor the inputs, (\u03b11 (MZ ), \u03b12 (MZ ), \u03b13 (MZ )) = (0.01695, 0.03382, 0.1176) and MSUSY = 1 TeV.\nFor the scale \u03bc \u2265 vP S , there are only two independent gauge couplings \u03b14 and \u03b12 = \u03b12R , so\nthat the gauge coupling unification is easily realized with a suitable Mc . In this figure, we\nhave taken (corresponding to the result in the next section)\nMc = 2.47 \u00d7 vP S = 2.95 \u00d7 1016 GeV\n\n(16)\n\nand after including Kaluza-Klein threshold contributions into the gauge coupling evolutions,\nthe gauge coupling unification is realized at\nMGUT = 7.54 \u00d7 1016 GeV.\n\n(17)\n\nAs Mc is raised, MGUT becomes smaller. As mentioned before, we assume that a more\nfundamental SO(10) GUT theory takes place at MGUT .\n\n4\n\nGaugino mediation and sparticle masses\n\nThe origin of SUSY breaking and its mediation to the MSSM sector is still a prime question\nin any phenomenological SUSY models. Since flavor-dependent soft SUSY breaking masses\nare severely constrained by the current experiments, a mechanism which naturally transmits\nSUSY breaking in a flavor-blind way is the most favorable one.\nIn higher dimensional models, the sequestering [21] is the easiest way to suppress flavordependent SUSY breaking effects to the MSSM matter sector. Since all matters reside on the\nPS brane in our model, the sequestering scenario is automatically realized when we simply\nassume a SUSY breaking sector on the brane at y = 0. The SO(10) gauge multiplet is in\nthe bulk and can directly communicate with the SUSY breaking sector through the higher\ndimensional operator of the form,\nZ\nX\nL \u223c \u03b4(y) d2 \u03b8 2 tr [W \u03b1 W\u03b1 ] ,\n(18)\nM5\nwhere X is a singlet chiral superfield which breaks SUSY by its F-component VEV, X =\n\u03b82 FX . Therefore, the bulk gaugino obtains the SUSY breaking soft mass,\n\u0012\n\u0013\nFX Mc\nFX M5\nM\u03bb \u223c\n\u2243\n,\n(19)\nM52\nMP MP\nwhere Mc comes from the wave function normalization of the bulk gaugino, and we have\nused the relation between the 4D and 5D Planck scales, M53 /Mc \u2243 MP2 (MP = 2.4 \u00d7 1018\nGeV) in the last equality. As usual, we take M\u03bb =100 GeV-1 TeV. Once the gaugino obtains\n7\n\n\fnon-zero mass, SUSY breaking terms for sfermions are automatically generated through the\nRGE from the compactification scale to the electroweak scale. This scenario is nothing but\nthe gaugino mediation [19] and flavor-blind sfermion masses are generated through the gauge\ninteractions. In this setup, a typical gaugino mass in Eq. (19) is smaller than the gravitino\nmass m3/2 \u2243 FX /MP by a factor M5 /MP < 1.\nAs discussed in Ref. [15], for Mc = vP S , we find that the right-handed slepton (normally,\nstau) is the LSP, because the sfermion mass spectrum is obtained from the boundary condition with vanishing soft masses at Mc = vP S = 1.19 \u00d7 1016 GeV. This result is problematic\nfor cosmology. As pointed out in Ref. [22], this stau LSP problem is cured by the soft mass\nRGE running from the compactification scale to the GUT scale in a GUT model. In the\nfollowing, we apply this idea to our model with Mc > vP S .\nFor the scale, vP S \u2264 \u03bc \u2264 Mc , we are in the PS stage and the RGEs of gaugino and\nsfermion masses are given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd M4\nd M2L\nd M2R\n=\n=\n= 0,\ndt \u03b14\ndt \u03b12L\ndt \u03b12R\ndm2F\u0303\n15\n3\n2\n= \u2212 \u03b14 M42 \u2212\n\u03b12L M2L\n,\ndt\n4\u03c0\n2\u03c0\ndm2F\u0303 c\n15\n3\n2\n= \u2212 \u03b14 M42 \u2212\n\u03b12R M2R\n,\n(20)\ndt\n4\u03c0\n2\u03c0\nwhere t = ln(\u03bc/Mc ), \u03b14 and \u03b12L = \u03b12R are the PS gauge coupling of the corresponding\ngauge groups (whose RGE solutions are obtained in the previous section), and M4 , M2L and\nM2R are the corresponding gaugino masses. Sfermion mass spectrum is obtained by solving\nthe RGEs with the boundary conditions, mF\u0303 (Mc ) = mF\u0303 c (Mc ) = 0. Analytic solutions of\nEq. (20) at \u03bc = vP S are easily found:\n\"\u0012\n\"\u0012\n#\n#\n\u00132\n\u00132\n5\n\u03b1\n(M\n)\n\u03b1\n(M\n)\n1\n4\nc\n2L\nc\n2\nm2F\u0303 (vP S ) =\nM 2 (vP S )\n(vP S )\n\u2212 1 + M2L\n\u22121 ,\n4 4\n\u03b14 (vP S )\n4\n\u03b12L (vP S )\n\"\u0012\n\"\u0012\n#\n#\n\u00132\n\u00132\n\u03b1\n(v\n)\n\u03b1\n(M\n)\n1\n5\n4\nP\nS\n2R\nc\n2\nM 2 (Mc )\n(vP S )\n\u2212 1 + M2R\n\u2212 1 .

Thus, the formulas for\nsfermion masses are simplified as\nm2F\u0303 (vP S ) = m2F\u0303 c (vP S )\n\u0013 \u0014\n\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0001 1 2\n\u0001\nM1/2 2 5 2\n2\n2\n\u03b1 (Mc ) \u2212 \u03b14 (vP S ) +\n\u03b1 (Mc ) \u2212 \u03b12L (vP S ) .\n=\n\u03b1GUT\n4 4\n4 2L\n8\n\n(23)\n\n\f1.2\n\n1.1\n\nR\n\n1.0\n\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\nMc \u0090vPS\n\nFigure 2: The ratio, R \u2261 m2e \u0303c /M12 , as a function of Mc /vP S . Here, soft masses have been\nevaluated at \u03bc = MSUSY . R = 1 when Mc /vP S = 2.47.\n\nSolving the RGEs in the MSSM with the universal boundary condition m2F\u0303 (vP S ) =\n= m20 at \u03bc = vP S , we obtain the sfermion masses at the electroweak scale. In\nour model, the PS scale is almost the same as the usual SUSY GUT scale in the MSSM\n(MGUT \u2243 2 \u00d7 1016 GeV) and the gauge couplings are roughly unified at the PS scale,\n\u03b14 (vP S ) \u2243 \u03b12 (vP S ) = \u03b12R (see Fig. 1). Therefore, our study on the sfermion masses are almost the same as the one usual in the constrained MSSM. For a small tan \u03b2 (say, tan \u03b2 = 10),\nwe neglect Yukawa coupling contributions to the soft masses of right-handed sleptons, and\nthe analytic solutions of the MSSM RGEs are found to be\n\u0012\n\u0013\nM1/2\nM1 (\u03bc) = \u03b11 (\u03bc)\n,\n\u03b1GUT\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0003\nM1/2 2 2 \u0002 2\n2\n\u03b11 (vP S ) \u2212 \u03b112 (\u03bc) + m20 .\n(24)\nme \u0303c (\u03bc) =\n\u03b1GUT\n11\nm2F\u0303 c (vP S )\n\nIf m0 is large enough, the slepton (stau) mass is bigger than the bino mass (M1 ). In our\nmodel, m0 is given as a function of Mc . Fig. 2 shows the ratio,\nR\u2261\n\nm2e \u0303c\n,\nM12\n\n(25)\n\nas a function of Mc /vP S . We can obtain R \u2265 1 for Mc /vP S \u2265 2.47.\nNow, for Mc /vP S \u2265 2.47, the bino-like neutralino will be the LSP and a good candidate\nfor the cold dark matter in cosmology [23]. For a small tan \u03b2, the annihilation processes of\nthe bino-like neutralino are dominated by p-wave and are not so efficient. As a result, the\nneutralino relic density tends to exceed the upper bound of the observed dark matter density.\nThis problem can be avoided if the neutralino is quasi-degenerate with the next LSP slepton\n9\n\n\f(stau), and the co-annihilation process with the next LSP can lead to the right dark matter\nrelic density. In our result, such a situation appears for Mc \u2243 2.47 \u00d7 vP S \u2243 2.95 \u00d7 1016 GeV.\nIt would be interesting to note that the discrepancy of the abundance of 7 Li between the\nobserved values in WMAP and in metal poor halo stars may be explained the degeneracy\nbetween the LSP neutralino and stau [24].\n\n5\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have considered SO(10) GUT in 5D, where the fifth dimension is compactified on the\nS 1 /(Z2 \u00d7Z2\u2032 ) orbifold with two inequivalent branes at the orbifold fixed points. All the matter\nand Higgs multiplets reside on the PS brane, while the SUSY breaking sector is on the other\nbrane. In this setup, we have two independent energy scales; vP S at which the PS symmetry\nis broken on the PS brane and Mc , the inverse of radius of the fifth dimension. Requiring\nthe left-right symmetry in the model, the PS symmetry breaking scale is determined from\nthe MSSM gauge coupling runnings. For the case with Mc > vP S , we have investigated the\ngauge coupling unification and the sparticle mass spectrum through the gaugino mediation.\nWe have found that after incorporating threshold corrections of Kaluza-Klein modes of the\nbulk gauge multiplets, the gauge couplings can be successfully unified at MGUT , whose scale\nis determined once Mc is fixed. Also, we have found that an appropriate choice of Mc leads\nto the bino-like LSP neutralino quasi-degenerating with the next LSP slepton (stau), so that\nthe co-annihilation between the LSP and next LSP provides the right relic abundance of the\nneutralino dark matter.\n\nAcknowledgments\nT.F. is grateful to S.
